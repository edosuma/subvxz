WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:11.261
[soothing lullaby twinkling]

00:13.138 --> 00:15.140
[Wilson cooing]

00:52.260 --> 00:53.511
[music halts]

00:53.595 --> 00:56.973
[woman shuddering]

00:57.057 --> 01:00.226
[foreboding music playing]

01:38.848 --> 01:41.059
Please, eat something.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.529
I understand you have a newborn.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.199
So do I.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.326
Ah, well…

02:00.245 --> 02:02.997
he's not so newborn anymore. He's a--

02:03.790 --> 02:05.125
[Maya] A two-month old,

02:06.167 --> 02:09.212
who was almost killed at his own baptism.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.549
Yes. [sighs]

02:15.009 --> 02:16.344
Yeah. Well.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.598
Of course you would know that,

02:21.933 --> 02:23.017
because you…

02:24.352 --> 02:27.939
you are the woman who moved the almighty
US government against Lagunas.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.401
Will you tell me about that?

02:32.735 --> 02:33.611
About what?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.446
You and Marty.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.783
How does it work?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.995
Marty Byrde's a brilliant man.

02:42.078 --> 02:45.081
Much better at what he does
than most federal agents.

02:45.957 --> 02:50.044
So, there's a… mutual respect.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.840
Out of that respect came a collaboration.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.134
[snickering]

02:57.427 --> 03:00.805
Please forgive me, but you make it sound
like he's the one who's useful to you.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.766
We're useful to each other.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.519
How so?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.938
You're still here, aren't you?

03:10.732 --> 03:11.691
[chuckles softly]

03:18.072 --> 03:22.202
Every single drug lord
who sleeps soundly at night

03:22.285 --> 03:24.329
does so for one of two reasons.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.958
Either the US government doesn't care
enough about them to kill them, or…

03:30.210 --> 03:32.503
the US government thinks killing them

03:33.421 --> 03:34.964
is inconvenient.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.761
Please go on.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.097
If you want to make it
inconvenient for us to kill you,

03:44.641 --> 03:48.519
if you want to eventually
live a life free of fear,

03:49.812 --> 03:52.482
you need to provide us
certain things in exchange.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.109
Such as?

03:55.818 --> 03:58.154
Years in a federal prison cell,

03:58.238 --> 04:01.199
the details of how your cartels operated,

04:01.282 --> 04:03.034
surrendering your product.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.370
Your weapons.

04:07.622 --> 04:12.085
Names and locations of every
US citizen you've made disappear.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.091
Otherwise, I have no reason
to bring this meeting to my superiors

04:18.174 --> 04:20.260
and I don't even know what I'm doing here.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.807
[sighs deeply]

04:29.727 --> 04:30.561
Well, then?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.024
[snickers]

04:46.744 --> 04:48.246
[airplane whirring]

04:48.329 --> 04:50.665
[snickering]

05:10.018 --> 05:11.519
[car engine turns over]

05:18.151 --> 05:19.402
[in Spanish] Let's go.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.257
[lullaby tune fades in and out]

05:50.516 --> 05:52.060
[footsteps approaching]

06:07.450 --> 06:10.244
[car approaching]

06:20.463 --> 06:23.216
[suspenseful music building]

06:25.051 --> 06:26.803
[door creaks and closes]

06:33.518 --> 06:36.062
-Where is he?
-Uh, in Jonah's room, what happened?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.814
Ask your boss.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.651
And until he's ready
to make a serious offer,

06:41.734 --> 06:44.237
stay the fuck away from me and my son.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.073
-Um… okay. Um…
-[line ringing]

06:47.156 --> 06:49.450
I'll check back with you
a little bit later on. Okay?

06:51.452 --> 06:52.286
[Omar] Yes?

06:52.370 --> 06:55.248
Uh, hey, it's-- it's-- it's me.
How did it go with Maya?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.251
[Omar] You're gonna need a sample.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.420
A sample?

07:00.503 --> 07:04.924
Shaw. Chicago, this week. They're gonna
want to know what they're buying, no?

07:05.007 --> 07:07.760
Uh… a sample. Okay.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
Good.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.182
Then I will send you one, and you…

07:14.725 --> 07:16.978
you will get Agent Miller back for me.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.523
[Marty] Yeah, it-- uh, you know,
it seems she might need a minute

07:20.606 --> 07:22.066
to get her head around all this.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.110
You don't win until I win, Marty.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.280
Don't forget that.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.991
[line disconnects]

07:45.047 --> 07:46.632
[brakes hiss]

07:48.134 --> 07:49.218
[car door opens]

08:06.068 --> 08:07.653
When's it ready to sell?

08:08.571 --> 08:11.282
Why does it matter?
Your deal's dead anyway.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.160
[scoffs] Well, you must not
rate much around here

08:14.243 --> 08:16.662
if no one bothered
to tell you it's back on.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.750
And before you go sticking your dick
in decisions above your pay grade,

08:20.833 --> 08:24.462
ask yourself, do you really want
to have to toss it in a Yeti

08:24.545 --> 08:26.881
while you pray
the doctors can sew it back on?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.886
The batch will be ready
day after tomorrow.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.096
[Ruth] Hmm.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.158
[phone buzzes]

09:17.098 --> 09:20.017
[footsteps approaching]

09:30.903 --> 09:34.782
Your father and I have asked
a lot of you since we came here.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.370
-More than any parent has a right to.
-Mom, it's not your fault.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.663
Oh yes, it is.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.127
And we want you to know that we know that.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.463
I know that.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.385
And even if we get angry or impatient, we…

09:56.429 --> 09:58.097
appreciate that you're here.

10:02.810 --> 10:07.189
This is a place where we can come
and remember Ben.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.860
Quietly, as a family.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.030
And I'll make-- I'll make sure
that this-- this is always lit,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.282
so when we look outside, we can see it.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.199
And if…

10:19.368 --> 10:22.163
anyone has anything
they want to say to him,

10:22.246 --> 10:24.999
they can write it down, and

10:26.667 --> 10:28.669
we'll know it's reaching him as it burns.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.258
Because he's right here.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.847
But he's not.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.058
Don't be an asshole.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.227
Maybe if you kill me,
you can make one of these too.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.235
[sinister music playing]

10:53.319 --> 10:54.695
He'll come around.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.800
[keyboard clattering]

11:31.273 --> 11:34.610
[computer fans whirring to a halt]

11:47.498 --> 11:49.500
[bugs chirring]

11:52.211 --> 11:54.964
Voicemail again. Damn it. Um…

11:55.798 --> 11:58.843
Maybe I should, uh,
go down there in the morning

11:59.635 --> 12:01.887
and, uh, smooth the waves myself.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.849
[Wendy] I thought you said
she needed space.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.562
Well, space only works
if Navarro is being patient

12:09.645 --> 12:11.772
and I'm not so sure we can count on that.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.774
Pushing hard doesn't work either.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.987
Well, hey, Wendy,

12:18.070 --> 12:20.698
if you hadn't,
she wouldn't have gotten on that plane

12:20.781 --> 12:23.033
and who knows where we'd be? You know?

12:28.998 --> 12:31.709
Maybe you should go down there tomorrow.
What do you think?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.211
[Wendy] Instead of you?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.591
[Marty sighs deeply]

12:39.967 --> 12:41.761
How did it go with Jonah today?

12:45.306 --> 12:46.307
Not well.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.025
[storm rumbling]

13:10.289 --> 13:13.334
[men chattering indistinctly]

13:37.900 --> 13:39.568
-[in Spanish] Good trip?
-Yes.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.073
I was scouting new territory.
We need to ramp up production.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.991
To meet Shaw's demand.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.660
[Omar clears his throat]

13:51.580 --> 13:54.500
Marty and Wendy Byrde
are heading up the deal?

13:55.626 --> 13:57.753
-It was their idea…
-Hmm.

13:59.713 --> 14:05.636
You don't think there should be someone
from the family in Chicago with them?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.849
What? You mean you?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.061
It's why I got my degree.

14:15.396 --> 14:19.275
Make sure these fucking corporate types
don't think they can walk all over us.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.446
I thought it was to keep
my big sister off my ass.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.866
[Javi] At least send me with a sample.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.827
So I can make sure
all our interests are protected

14:29.910 --> 14:31.579
and things don't go sideways.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.538
[Omar] Javi.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.165
I'm tired.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.301
[footsteps fade]

14:45.384 --> 14:46.594
Motherfucker.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.976
[Jim] Hey. How's the view from
atop that $150 million mountain?

14:54.476 --> 14:55.603
Well, it'd be a lot better

14:55.686 --> 14:59.106
if you could get us face time with
Senator Schafer the day after tomorrow.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.651
Well, don't you think
we should start a little closer to home?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.738
Geographically or politically?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.116
Both. I think we stand
a better chance with Schafer

15:09.199 --> 15:11.368
if we can come to him
with commitments in hand.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.245
People love a winner.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.332
It's gonna take a while to reel him in.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.919
I want to-- I want to set the hook early.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.130
All right, well, I'll set it up,
but you bring your A game.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.549
You know how much I hate it
when my magic's wasted.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.763
Bassinet's in the bedroom,
but you can move it easy enough.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.806
The bottle warmer's by the stove.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.391
Here's the changing table.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.852
Don't forget to keep
the baby wipes at body temp.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.022
Well, there's just no stopping progress.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.942
[doorbell chimes]

15:58.916 --> 16:00.668
Your boss have something for me?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.629
I'd be angry too.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.467
Angry is what I get when
someone cuts me off in traffic.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.011
[Wendy] When you become a parent,

16:11.595 --> 16:13.973
a whole other instinct kicks in.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.767
It makes you do things
you never imagined you could do.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.186
I'm not doing this with you.

16:19.269 --> 16:22.272
[Wendy] When I first met him,
when I got home,

16:23.565 --> 16:26.235
it took a full day
for the adrenaline to run its course.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.072
[Maya] The difference
is you chose it. I didn't.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.574
I can still appreciate
how much we're asking of you.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.995
If you can appreciate it,
why the hell are you still doing this?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.707
When there's a much easier out.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.044
If you don't know that already,
you will soon.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.718
My mother says
being a parent makes you selfish.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.345
No. No.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.932
It makes you fierce.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.064
I still need something from your boss.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.192
Hey there, uh, Mr. Madden.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.903
It is Marty Byrde from
the Missouri Belle and The Big Muddy.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.490
Um… Hey, listen, we-- we just recently
started giving out markers,

17:13.574 --> 17:16.201
and I was wondering
if you could tell us, um,

17:16.285 --> 17:20.039
what, uh… what… what…
what percentage of your handle, uh,

17:20.122 --> 17:22.666
do you-- do you typically have
in outstanding markers?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.127
Mm-hmm.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.421
Okay, and, uh,

17:27.504 --> 17:30.674
and then what's-- what's
the attrition rate on those markers?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.345
Yeah. Well, that's, um…

17:36.221 --> 17:37.264
Hey Jonah.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.434
Can I-- Sir, can I call you back
in one sec? Thank you.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.810
-Um…
-[phone clicks off]

17:41.894 --> 17:45.230
-What are you doing? What's going on?
-Mom cut the power to the basement.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.525
Mom cut the power to the basement.
When did she do that?

17:48.609 --> 17:52.446
Yesterday, when I was in the middle of
testing an automated deposit flow-chain.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.949
If one of those deposits was
in process when the power cut--

17:56.033 --> 17:59.453
Yeah, then the account gets flagged
and the whole chain needs to get rebuilt.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.996
I can't work like this.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.124
Yeah. Well, you know,
maybe you shouldn't be working at all.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.710
I mean, maybe that's
what Mom was trying to say to you--

18:07.544 --> 18:08.378
Hello.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.632
Before you blow a fucking gasket,

18:11.715 --> 18:13.425
I'm only doing what he asked.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.637
If he asks for a hit of smack,
would you give him that too?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.807
The kid had 16 shell corps up and running

18:20.724 --> 18:22.309
before I could even say "Panama."

18:23.227 --> 18:26.063
Well, he's still, uh…
he's still just a kid, you know?

18:26.146 --> 18:27.523
So was I when you hired me.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.817
And that's working out great, isn't it?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.028
[quietly] Fucking great.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.739
[Ruth groans]

18:35.823 --> 18:37.658
What the fuck is she doing here?

18:37.741 --> 18:40.077
[Marty] Somebody cut
the power to the basement.

18:40.577 --> 18:44.581
Oh, was I supposed to just let him keep
committing felonies under our roof?

18:44.665 --> 18:48.544
Well, you know, now he's moving his office
so he can commit them somewhere else.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.422
-No. No, no, no he is not.
-That's the way it's looking. Yep.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.802
-[Wendy] Jonah! Jonah, come here.
-[Marty] Wendy. Wendy.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.053
[Wendy] Jonah, drop it!

18:59.096 --> 19:02.015
Just… Just hear me.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.686
[shuddering] You're angry about Ben?

19:05.769 --> 19:08.772
So am I. But you know
who you should be angry at?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
-I don't think this is helping--
-Stay the fuck out of this!

19:11.316 --> 19:13.277
-You got it.
-She's the one.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.863
She's the one
who let him out of the hospital

19:15.946 --> 19:17.990
when she knew he wasn't well.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.701
No wonder he wants out, Marty.
Look at her.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.914
[shuddering] She's the one
who put him in harm's way.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.084
She is the one who got your uncle killed.
She and that--

19:29.168 --> 19:30.502
[shouting] That psycho!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.172
Who kidnapped you!

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
And shaved your head!

19:34.965 --> 19:37.509
So, if you think-- if you think…

19:37.593 --> 19:40.304
You think these two lunatics
are gonna protect you

19:40.387 --> 19:42.097
when the shit hits the fan?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.891
You've got another thing coming.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.226
Jonah.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.186
Jonah?

19:49.396 --> 19:50.981
[engine turns over]

19:57.154 --> 19:58.614
What are you doing, Wendy?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.366
[sobbing] I'm fighting for our family!

20:01.867 --> 20:04.036
And what the fuck are you doing?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.317
Here you go.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.070
[Wyatt] Hey.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.074
So I saw you at the farm yesterday.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.786
Okay.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.540
You know, Ruth, if Darlene finds out--

20:50.624 --> 20:52.876
She ain't gonna find out, is she?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.003
Not until she's holding
hot stacks of cash,

20:55.087 --> 20:57.881
by which point she'll realize
what you and I already know.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.133
My plan's best for business.

21:00.842 --> 21:01.843
Is it?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.346
Is it?

21:05.764 --> 21:09.059
Because you know so much about it.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.355
Six months ago, you thought liquidity was
what happened when you spilled your bong.

21:13.438 --> 21:17.067
I'm not the one that hired a fucking
teenager to do our laundering, okay?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.528
Was I supposed to run an ad?

21:19.611 --> 21:23.657
"Launderer needed, police need not apply"?

21:23.740 --> 21:25.659
And he ain't just any teenager.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.995
-He's Marty Byrde's teenager.
-Ah, right.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.331
-It's not about what's best for business.
-Didn't I just say it was about--

21:31.415 --> 21:34.376
It's about you having to
get back at Marty, and the fact--

21:34.459 --> 21:35.419
-What?
-Nah.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.129
What? Just fucking say it, Wy.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.631
Ruth, you fight with
everyone you work with.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.174
Fucking everyone.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.176
It's like you can't help it.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.595
And then once you start fighting,

21:45.679 --> 21:48.223
it becomes more about the fight
than it does the work.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.604
No, I don't.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.190
[scoffs] Really? Think about it.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.986
Everyone you've worked with,
what do they have in common?

22:02.529 --> 22:05.449
Look, I want this to work out
with me, you and Darlene.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.992
I do. Okay?

22:07.075 --> 22:10.037
So please, don't fuck this up too.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.545
It's a great fucking plan, Wy.

22:18.628 --> 22:19.713
And you know it!

22:20.213 --> 22:21.923
[engine turns over]

22:37.898 --> 22:40.025
[Erin] Where the fuck
is my mom, Charlotte?

22:40.108 --> 22:43.570
My dad's looking everywhere, even hired
some P.I. that's now back from the Ozarks

22:43.653 --> 22:45.447
and said even he couldn't find anything.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.991
That he talked to you all
and you said you didn't know anything.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.576
We both know that's not true.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
[Charlotte] Erin,
you need to calm down, okay?

22:53.121 --> 22:55.082
I thought your Mom went back to Chicago.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.085
I don't believe you.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.004
I'm telling you the truth, Erin.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.925
Just like when you said we were friends?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.721
I told you the truth when you asked me.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.889
Didn't I?

23:11.765 --> 23:14.309
When no one else would tell you
what your mom really did,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.144
I was the one that said it.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.190
And I'm telling you the truth now.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.943
Then where the fuck is she?

23:30.742 --> 23:32.786
I'll see what I can find out, okay?

23:33.829 --> 23:34.704
Okay.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.922
[Charlotte] I have to go to Chicago
with you and Mom.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.883
-Why?
-Erin called.

23:48.593 --> 23:49.845
What does she want?

23:49.928 --> 23:53.181
She's wondering where her mom is
and she's convinced we know something.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.309
I can't have that conversation
with her over the phone.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.478
[Marty] Mm-hmm.
You have to have it with her at all?

23:58.562 --> 23:59.855
[Wendy] Yes.

23:59.938 --> 24:00.981
Yes, she does.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.907
All right, well, why don't we
make a family trip out of it?

24:10.991 --> 24:11.992
[Charlotte] Hmm?

24:12.075 --> 24:15.162
Yeah? Mom's the only one
that's been back since we moved,

24:15.245 --> 24:18.582
and we can just, you know,
make a, like, a reverse vacation.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.168
I can't. I have work.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.882
We can go to Portillo's
and get chocolate cake shakes. [chuckles]

24:26.965 --> 24:28.633
[Wendy] Don't bother, Charlotte.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.927
Not worth your time.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.350
[faucet running]

24:37.434 --> 24:39.227
[Marty] Think it's smart
to leave him alone

24:39.311 --> 24:40.854
while the three of us are out of town?

24:40.937 --> 24:43.315
What, you want me to beg
for his approval like you?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.402
Might work better than cutting the power.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.157
I tried to make peace. He spit in my face.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.784
And I wouldn't have had to cut the power

24:54.868 --> 24:56.995
if you'd only backed me on this
from the beginning.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.121
Wendy, I did back you.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.208
-I warned Ruth you and I aren't happy--
-You're still proud of him.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.001
You can't help it and he senses that,

25:03.084 --> 25:05.629
and he won't stop
until he sees that he's only safe with us.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.882
Wow. Look, that's muscling.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.968
-That's not parenting.
-What do you think brought Charlotte back?

25:12.052 --> 25:14.304
[Marty] Charlotte realized
she had no place else to go.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.933
Neither does Jonah.
He's just doesn't know it yet.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.154
[Marty] I want the security system
on at all times, okay?

25:31.238 --> 25:33.114
No one else is allowed in the house.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.033
I want you home by 10:00.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.160
Lights out by 11:00.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.956
All right? And, uh, this should be
more than enough for food

25:41.039 --> 25:44.000
or any unforeseen emergency.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.669
Got it?

25:45.752 --> 25:48.672
You know my net worth
is more than six figures, Dad.

25:48.755 --> 25:52.217
I know, buddy, but it's all tied up
in crypto and offshore accounts, right?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.344
That's a little liquidity, just in case.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.847
Don't do anything I wouldn't.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.101
So do steal ten grand
and buy a shitty van?

26:02.310 --> 26:03.812
Well, you gotta live a little.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.439
Okay. Love you, pal.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.568
[engine turns over]

26:12.571 --> 26:14.281
Are you really not gonna say goodbye?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.618
[sarcastically] Fantastic.

26:35.385 --> 26:38.722
[tense music building]

26:55.447 --> 26:57.824
-[keyboard clacking]
-[electronic zapping]

26:57.907 --> 27:01.286
[Jonah] So you click this little icon here
and the workflow runs itself.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.914
Starts and ends with the same accounts,
but on its way there,

27:04.998 --> 27:08.960
each deposit takes one of 20 trillion
randomized paths through our other shells.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.338
[Ruth] Twenty trillion?

27:11.838 --> 27:14.883
Yeah, 16 factorial
is a little more than 20.9 trillion.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.553
-Holy fucking fuck.
-Yeah, pretty much.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.722
-[car approaching]
-Once our Internet's upgraded,

27:20.805 --> 27:23.308
each deposit will make that journey
in a matter of seconds.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.819
[knocking on door]

27:36.029 --> 27:37.280
[Ruth clears her throat]

27:39.282 --> 27:42.786
What makes you think you can move
my product without my say-so?

27:44.746 --> 27:46.039
Fucking Wyatt.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.123
[Darlene scoffs]

27:48.083 --> 27:51.753
Well, he may be your cousin,
but he's my lover.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.047
And I'm your partner, who you brought on

27:54.130 --> 27:57.884
because you know your business needs
fresh blood and fresh thinking.

27:59.302 --> 28:01.930
I brought you on because I like you,

28:02.889 --> 28:06.643
and because you got balls
for being such a slight little thing.

28:06.726 --> 28:09.646
But the second
they start swelling like a dog's,

28:09.729 --> 28:11.564
I'm gonna take them right off.

28:13.149 --> 28:15.026
Don't lay a finger on my product.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.081
[engine turns over]

28:29.666 --> 28:30.583
[Jonah] I'm sorry.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.256
I can't believe he fucking ratted me out.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.676
Yeah. It sucks.

28:41.970 --> 28:42.971
Um…

28:44.180 --> 28:45.640
Are all our accounts online?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.309
[electronic beeping and zapping]

28:48.393 --> 28:49.853
As of an hour ago.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.897
Good. We'll be using them tomorrow.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.238
[door closes]

29:08.747 --> 29:10.457
[Wendy] So you're meeting her in the park?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.500
Public place. Open space.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.754
[chuckling] Smart.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.883
I should go.

29:19.966 --> 29:20.925
Okay.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.220
-Okay.
-[Marty] Good luck.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.226
-[Wendy] She's got this.
-[Marty] Yeah.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.607
-[woman] Wendy? Marty? What?
-[Wendy chuckling] Oh my God.

29:35.690 --> 29:39.110
-[Marty] Hi. How have you been?
-Would you look at this! Hi!

29:39.194 --> 29:41.571
-[woman] Great to see you.
-[Marty] You too. Hey, man.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.864
-[woman] Hey!
-[Wendy] Hi!

29:42.947 --> 29:44.949
-[woman] How are you?
-[Wendy chuckling] Hello!

29:45.033 --> 29:46.743
[man] What the heck
are you two doing here?

29:46.826 --> 29:49.829
Well, we, uh-- we just-- We thought
we'd come into town for some business.

29:50.622 --> 29:54.375
Okay, so it's true what they said, then.
That you all moved--

29:54.459 --> 29:57.086
We moved to Missouri
and we opened a casino.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.547
-At least that part's true.
-Sean.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.009
Well, you know, we-- we wanted,
uh, we wanted a simpler life, and--

30:03.092 --> 30:05.762
Yeah. Marty ran the numbers,
we saw it was in reach.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.847
-[phone ringing]
-Yeah, and off we went. So…

30:07.931 --> 30:09.599
-[woman] Just-- Just like that.
-Yeah.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.601
-Ooh, I should-- I should take that.
-Yeah.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.604
Excuse me.
I gotta take this real quick. Hello?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.315
[Omar] Where are we with Agent Miller?

30:17.398 --> 30:18.358
Uh…

30:19.359 --> 30:21.110
-We're working on it.
-No.

30:21.194 --> 30:24.572
You're 400 miles away,
working on saving yourselves,

30:24.656 --> 30:26.282
when I already told you, Marty--

30:26.366 --> 30:29.077
[Marty] "We don't win unless you win."
I did not forget that.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.372
No. No, no, no, no.
You don't win until I win.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.124
It's a big difference.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.669
Right.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.796
Give me her number.

30:39.879 --> 30:40.797
No.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.132
No?

30:44.008 --> 30:46.928
No. Wendy just got back
from smoothing things over

30:47.011 --> 30:49.639
from the last time
your impatience almost fucked this up,

30:49.722 --> 30:51.516
so we're gonna do it our way this time.

30:51.599 --> 30:52.600
Listen, I gotta run.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.977
[line disconnects]

30:56.980 --> 30:57.897
[snorts]

30:57.981 --> 30:59.357
[Wendy] We're right on the water,

30:59.440 --> 31:01.651
so the kids can swim and boat
whenever they want.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.695
-[woman] That sounds idyllic.
-Yeah.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.488
Sorry, what'd I miss?

31:05.572 --> 31:08.533
Wendy was telling us how you became
the masters of your own destiny.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.910
Yeah. [chuckling nervously]

31:10.994 --> 31:12.537
Ah, well.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.707
-All good?
-Yes. Yeah, yeah. All good.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.793
Just a misunderstanding.
We'll-- we'll work it out. Um…

31:19.878 --> 31:21.421
-Great to see you guys.
-[chuckles]

31:21.504 --> 31:22.797
-[woman] Yeah, you too.
-Yeah.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.174
[woman] Yeah, okay. Bye! Okay, well…

31:25.258 --> 31:26.259
-Bye.
-Take care.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.343
Yeah.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.481
I'm here to see your boss.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.192
You can park over there.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.537
[grunts]

31:58.124 --> 32:00.084
Your rehab permits were pulled.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.296
[Darlene] Byrde leaned
on the state inspectors.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.425
And you knew?

32:07.926 --> 32:08.760
Yeah.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.555
You didn't think to warn me
before my guys lost a day

32:12.639 --> 32:14.265
running to shuttered workhouses?

32:15.558 --> 32:17.060
Like how you warned me

32:17.143 --> 32:19.771
before I lost months refining a product

32:19.854 --> 32:23.274
that you were
too chickenshit to distribute?

32:23.358 --> 32:26.527
You are half a mil in the hole
to me over these rehabs.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.488
If I were you, I'd quit digging.

32:28.988 --> 32:32.700
Well, lucky for you
I have come to pay you back.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.578
Figured you deserved a second chance.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.791
I'm a little short on cash,

32:40.291 --> 32:42.835
seeing as I got no distribution.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.964
Then I suggest you go find some.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.173
Right now.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.387
If I do, you won't see a cent.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.890
I don't think you quite understand.
I am asking--

32:57.725 --> 32:58.726
Fuck that.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.230
I'm demanding you give me what you owe me.

33:05.274 --> 33:09.529
I can't help people
who refuse to help themselves.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.322
[Zeke fussing]

33:25.962 --> 33:27.130
What did you find?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.512
I'm so sorry.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.518
[Erin shuddering]

33:40.601 --> 33:43.730
-I knew it. I fucking knew it.
-I'm so sorry, Erin.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.773
Why, 'cause you're the ones who did it?

33:48.317 --> 33:50.445
We didn't have anything to do with it.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.113
Then how did it happen?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.992
She worked for dangerous people.

33:56.617 --> 33:59.954
-So do your parents. They're still alive.
-They're lucky.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.581
Or they did it.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.125
That doesn't make any sense.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.587
Why would they let me come tell you
if they had anything to do with it?

34:08.921 --> 34:11.090
Because they want me
to stop asking questions.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.010
They know this could land on them,
so they want me to shut up.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.094
Erin!

34:19.849 --> 34:21.934
Everything you're feeling right now,

34:22.018 --> 34:23.936
you have every right to feel.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.691
But for your sake,
and the sake of everyone that you love,

34:28.775 --> 34:32.361
you need to forget
that this conversation ever happened.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.865
Because if even
one other person finds out,

34:35.948 --> 34:37.909
you'll be next,

34:38.785 --> 34:40.161
followed by Seth,

34:40.745 --> 34:43.414
then your Dad, and his girlfriend.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.960
And that's the last thing
that anyone wants.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.341
-You don't know what will happen.
-I do.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.551
Trust me.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.895
Look at me.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.064
Erin.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.816
Look at me.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.074
Just because we didn't have
anything to do with your mom,

35:19.742 --> 35:22.411
it doesn't mean
we're not capable in the future

35:22.495 --> 35:24.539
if we don't have any other choice.

35:24.622 --> 35:28.042
[foreboding music intensifies]

35:35.424 --> 35:38.219
[ambient office noises and chatter]

35:42.390 --> 35:44.016
-[man] Mr. Byrde.
-Yeah.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.146
Connor McVeigh, Shaw Medical security,
here to escort you off site to Miss Shaw.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.357
Okay, great. We're still waiting
on a courier with a sample,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.818
and, uh, I wasn't told, you know, when--

35:55.820 --> 35:56.988
Sorry I'm late.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.240
That damn Ryan.

36:00.992 --> 36:01.826
Follow me.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.036
Hola, Marty.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.122
-Hi.
-It's good to see you again.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.421
[Connor] Arms up.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.597
Cell phones.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.522
In the bag or the deal ends now.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.655
[tense music building]

37:00.885 --> 37:02.011
[Schafer] Do you like?

37:02.094 --> 37:06.474
I gave one to each of my biggest donors
at my retirement party.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.894
-Dr. King.
-[Schafer grunts]

37:10.478 --> 37:14.899
Not what you were expecting from
the epicenter of the state's moral blight?

37:16.317 --> 37:17.318
You remember.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.111
How can I forget?

37:20.988 --> 37:23.032
Not exactly in keeping with your plaque.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.659
Oh yeah. But it--

37:24.742 --> 37:29.038
It is. I always saw your guy as a friend
I could reach across the aisle to

37:29.121 --> 37:31.249
until he started working with you.

37:32.541 --> 37:37.338
Which is why I've been waiting
years to say "fuck you" to your face.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.509
At least let me make my pitch, Randall.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.386
Whenever you're ready.

37:50.977 --> 37:54.814
The Byrde Family Foundation
is a non-profit,

37:54.897 --> 37:58.484
apolitical organization that understands
to get anything done in the Midwest,

37:58.567 --> 38:00.361
you have to reach across the aisle.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.948
We started with payday loan abuse
and foreclosure relief,

38:04.031 --> 38:07.535
but now we have an opportunity
to fight the opioid epidemic.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.204
None of which discriminates
between red or blue.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.082
That's why Wendy
enlisted me and my experience

38:13.165 --> 38:16.836
working for Missouri's
most influential Republican donors.

38:17.628 --> 38:22.675
And we can't think of a more responsible
steward for the foundation's funds

38:22.758 --> 38:25.136
than a man who spent a decade

38:25.219 --> 38:28.597
as the ranking Republican member
of the Senate budget committee.

38:28.681 --> 38:32.351
A man who still plays
a massive role in shaping

38:32.435 --> 38:35.980
what is and is not politically
possible in the Prairie State.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.690
[Schafer] Mm-hmm.

38:37.773 --> 38:41.110
[tsks] So, you want to buy my obedience

38:41.193 --> 38:43.946
with some third-rate flattery
and a board seat?

38:48.284 --> 38:53.247
How about access to $150 million
war chest that we now control?

38:54.248 --> 38:57.376
[Jim] The road to the White House,
for the next 30 years,

38:57.460 --> 39:00.546
goes through Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ohio and Missouri.

39:00.629 --> 39:04.300
But since you've retired,
your reach only goes as far as Illinois.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.428
Think about the kind of influence
that purchasing power could buy you

39:07.511 --> 39:09.305
across the region, Senator.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.806
And across the country.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.104
[Schafer sighs]

39:17.188 --> 39:18.147
Is that a yes?

39:19.231 --> 39:22.943
It's a slightly less vehement fuck-you.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.493
Well…

39:32.912 --> 39:34.914
don't take too long with your decision.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.792
Those board seats are filling up.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.050
-You didn't even break a sweat.
-There was a time

39:46.133 --> 39:50.596
when Schafer was the scariest man
I could imagine speaking to. [scoffs]

39:54.892 --> 39:58.145
[Clare] Pardon the gadgetry.
Family of chemists.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.565
[Marty] And a diverse
real estate portfolio.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.361
[Javi] I admire a woman
who does her own dirty work.

40:08.239 --> 40:13.035
I, uh… I made sure that… that your
financial back-channel infrastructure, uh,

40:13.119 --> 40:17.581
will still point anyone paying attention
to your suppliers to Tasmania.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.542
It's the same tax protocols.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.045
No layering necessary.
It's all frictionless.

40:23.587 --> 40:26.090
And we're overhauling
our production process,

40:26.173 --> 40:28.175
so all our output is medical grade.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.011
Combine that with Marty's work,

40:31.095 --> 40:33.431
and we'll be pulling off
the perfect sleight of hand.

40:41.897 --> 40:45.317
It's indistinguishable
from our Tasmanian supply.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.194
[tsking] Ah! Muy bien.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.031
Then it looks like I'll be seeing
a lot more of you, Ms. Shaw.

40:53.200 --> 40:57.455
From here on out, I'll be my uncle's
personal representative on this deal.

40:58.789 --> 41:02.209
I'd love to grab dinner when I'm in town
to supervise the first shipment.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.217
-[in Spanish] Congratulations.
-[both chuckle]

41:11.886 --> 41:15.514
You're the first gringo I've met whose
family's killed more people than mine.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.394
[bugs chirring]

41:53.260 --> 41:56.972
All right. Is there a club
around here, we can go party?

41:58.265 --> 42:00.059
Not without drawing too much heat.

42:00.142 --> 42:03.854
Oh, there's no chance
these guys are waiting till they get home.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.068
Follow me.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.492
["Dreams" by Scantron playing on stereo]

42:16.575 --> 42:19.453
Were you named after that guy
from the insurance commercial?

42:19.537 --> 42:23.541
[laughing] No, dipshit,
he's named after The Intimidator.

42:24.124 --> 42:26.794
Holy fuck, y'all need
to educate yourselves.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.170
Dale Earnhardt, Senior.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.506
All right, greatest NASCAR driver
there ever was.

42:31.173 --> 42:33.175
Okay? Drove the number three car.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.095
What about Jonah? He your cousin too?

42:38.889 --> 42:41.725
Uh… Nah. Nah.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.686
He's just my business partner.

42:46.772 --> 42:49.149
[Darlene] You fucking did it, didn't you?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.110
[Ruth] Yes, I fucking did.

42:51.193 --> 42:54.071
Tell me why I shouldn't take
your head off right now.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.663
A: there's a hell of a lot more
where that came from.

43:02.746 --> 43:07.710
B: you've been waiting for a partner
with as much guts as you your whole life.

43:07.793 --> 43:12.214
C: if you try, there's no guarantee
I won't take off yours first.

43:27.229 --> 43:30.274
I knew I made the right call
bringing you on.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.474
Gentlemen.

44:03.557 --> 44:04.558
Gracias.

44:05.851 --> 44:06.810
Thank you.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.813
[in Spanish] Fucking motherfucker.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.023
Everything all right?

44:13.233 --> 44:15.319
When Blackwater over there stole my phone,

44:16.111 --> 44:18.572
-a gun shipment got moved up to tonight.
-[dialing]

44:19.782 --> 44:21.241
[in Spanish] Hey. What's up?

44:27.706 --> 44:29.124
[dialing]

44:31.835 --> 44:33.545
[line ringing]

44:38.967 --> 44:40.260
[Omar] What is it, Marty?

44:40.344 --> 44:41.345
Yeah, um…

44:42.304 --> 44:46.100
Give up that gun shipment
that Javi's setting up for tonight.

44:46.183 --> 44:49.645
It's, uh… It's exactly
what Maya's looking for,

44:49.728 --> 44:52.523
and if you wanna get her back,
this is how you do it.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.858
You've already won the war.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.195
Those guns will be more valuable
as a bargaining chip to get Maya back

44:58.278 --> 44:59.780
than they are in your hands.

45:00.572 --> 45:02.116
Are you fucking me, Marty?

45:02.866 --> 45:06.120
You really think that I'd risk my life
suggesting this with Javi right here

45:06.203 --> 45:08.080
if I didn't think it was
absolutely necessary?

45:08.580 --> 45:10.791
Ah, doesn't mean you're not fucking me.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.211
To prove to you
how much I'm not fucking you,

45:14.294 --> 45:16.880
I'll give you Maya's number
and you can call her yourself.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.799
So get a piece of paper and start writing.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.111
[Wendy chuckles]

45:40.821 --> 45:41.655
Where's Marty?

45:41.739 --> 45:43.490
In the garage with your partner.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.244
-What?
-Not him. The nephew.

45:51.331 --> 45:54.418
If Javi said or-- or did anything,

45:54.501 --> 45:56.628
you-- you must know he's-- he's not--

45:56.712 --> 45:58.297
What? In charge?

45:58.380 --> 46:01.633
He said he's his uncle's
personal representative on this deal.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.472
And so what if he is?

46:07.181 --> 46:08.849
Does it really make a difference?

46:08.932 --> 46:12.311
I'm considering closing
a billion-dollar drug deal, Wendy.

46:18.233 --> 46:20.652
How is this any better
than what my brother did?

46:22.529 --> 46:24.865
-The jobs you'll save, for one.
-Jobs?

46:25.908 --> 46:27.618
Great American excuse.

46:31.830 --> 46:34.333
Look, I love my family despite…

46:35.542 --> 46:40.172
all of it, but I'm trying to save them
without becoming them.

46:45.427 --> 46:48.555
Concentrate on the illegal drugs
you'll get off the street.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.850
The rehab clinics
that we'll start together,

46:51.934 --> 46:54.394
the lives that those will save.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.733
I know it might not
feel like it right now,

47:00.901 --> 47:04.238
but it really is, it's the only way
to make the bad mean something.

47:05.405 --> 47:06.365
Bury it.

47:07.658 --> 47:08.617
Bury it.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.245
Pile good on top of good.

48:12.598 --> 48:13.473
Hello?

48:14.558 --> 48:16.894
[Omar] You wanted something from me, so…

48:17.644 --> 48:18.770
here it is.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.150
My show of good faith, huh?

48:25.152 --> 48:26.862
How did you get this number?

48:27.362 --> 48:29.197
How do you think, Agent Miller?

48:34.578 --> 48:36.496
Now do you want what I have or not?

48:47.215 --> 48:50.761
I… I have to go, right now.

48:51.511 --> 48:53.555
[mother] Okay, then go.

48:54.723 --> 48:57.643
We'll be right here whenever you get back.

49:12.157 --> 49:14.618
Well, should we go sit down?
We're not tourists.

49:17.704 --> 49:21.416
When I was walking in the park today,
it almost felt like we'd never left.

You coming?

you're not sure?

50:34.239 --> 50:36.658
[Charlotte] I haven't had
a lot of time to think about it.

50:36.742 --> 50:39.703
[Javi] Well, you've only got a few months
until applications are due.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.830
You two are not
talking about this with her?

50:42.748 --> 50:43.665
No, we are.

50:43.749 --> 50:44.708
She's got time.

50:45.208 --> 50:48.879
Charlotte, college… can't be missed.

50:48.962 --> 50:54.301
And not because of the classes,
but… the whole experience, huh?

Don't tell me you're gonna make me
eat all these oysters myself? Vamos.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.211
You too, sweetie.

51:29.795 --> 51:30.921
-Now.
-Hmm?

51:31.004 --> 51:32.339
Mm-hmm. Sí.
