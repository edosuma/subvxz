01:09.670 --> 01:11.372
MACKENZIE,
THE DOOR IS STUCK!

01:11.405 --> 01:13.107
HONEY!

01:13.141 --> 01:14.408
[chair thumping]

01:17.245 --> 01:20.681
WHO IS OUT THERE?

01:20.714 --> 01:22.816
MACKENZIE, ANSWER ME!

01:22.850 --> 01:27.288
IF YOU TOUCH MY BABY,
I'LL KILL YOU!

01:28.556 --> 01:31.459
HELP! I'M TRAPPED IN HERE!

01:31.492 --> 01:33.427
PLEASE, COME BACK
WITH MY BABY!

01:35.229 --> 01:37.298
- HUH?

01:37.331 --> 01:39.567
- CALL 911!

01:39.600 --> 01:40.768
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THE PERPETRATOR?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.136
- NO, I NEVER SAW HIM.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.337
HE LOCKED ME
IN THE BATHROOM.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.405
- DID HE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.640
- NO, NO.
I WAS 20 FEET AWAY,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.776
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO TO PROTECT HER.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.344
- WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

01:50.378 --> 01:52.513
- HE'S AT WORK,
WHERE HE ALWAYS IS.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.881
HE SAID
HE'D BE RIGHT HERE.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.649
I DON'T KNOW
WHY IT'S TAKING HIM SO LONG.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.186
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO TOOK MACKENZIE?

01:58.219 --> 02:00.421
- ONE OF THESE MEN.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.395
- YOU KEEP A FILE
OF CHILD MOLESTERS.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.664
- WHO LIVE WITHIN A TEN-BLOCK
RADIUS OF OUR APARTMENT.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.567
I PRINTED IT OFF
THE SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRY.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.603
- I LIVE HERE, DAMN IT!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.738
OH, MY GOD.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.743
- I--I CAN'T
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.744
I CAN'T.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.213
- AGAIN?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.381
MACKENZIE'S
GONE MISSING BEFORE?

02:27.415 --> 02:32.286
- OUR OTHER DAUGHTER, ELLA,
WAS ABDUCTED TEN YEARS AGO.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.889
- WAS THAT EVER RESOLVED?

02:35.923 --> 02:37.658
- NO.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.193
SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.229
SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.

02:41.262 --> 02:45.766
- WHAT IF--WHAT IF HE'S BEEN
WATCHING HER ALL THESE YEARS,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.936
AND HE CAME
BACK FOR MACKENZIE?

02:56.344 --> 03:04.352
*

03:42.022 --> 03:44.292
- I ALWAYS KEEP THE FRONT DOOR
LOCKED AND DEADBOLTED.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.327
- OKAY, WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY NOW.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.428
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE A KEY?

03:47.461 --> 03:48.462
- NO.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.697
- YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING MISSING?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
WE'RE JUST WASTING TIME.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.833
SHOULDN'T WE BE
OUT THERE LOOKING FOR HER?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.635
- WE'VE ALREADY ISSUED
AN AMBER ALERT,

03:54.668 --> 03:56.904
BUT EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAIL
THAT YOU CAN GIVE US

03:56.937 --> 03:57.971
COULD HELP US
FIND YOUR DAUGHTER.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.474
- WHERE'S HER BACKPACK?

04:00.508 --> 04:01.942
- WELL, I HUNG IT
ON THE CHAIR

04:01.975 --> 04:03.444
THIS MORNING
WHEN I WAS CLEANING.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.379
MAYBE SHE BROUGHT IT
IN THE DINING ROOM.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.847
- CHECK YOUR PURSE.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.549
- FOR WHAT?
- MISSING CREDIT CARDS.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.884
IF THE KIDNAPPER USED THEM,
WE CAN TRACK HIM THAT WAY.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.886
- SEEMS LIKE A PAIR
IS MISSING.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.289
- OH, SHE MUST BE WEARING
HER WHEELIE SNEAKERS.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.058
PAMELA ALMOST KILLED ME
WHEN I BOUGHT THEM FOR HER.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.293
- THE CARDS ARE ALL HERE,

04:19.327 --> 04:23.764
BUT I TOOK OUT $200 FROM THE ATM
YESTERDAY AND IT'S MISSING.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.666
- WHY WOULD
HE LEAVE THE CARDS?

04:25.699 --> 04:29.370
- MRS. BURTON,
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE

04:29.403 --> 04:31.372
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
WAS IN YOUR APARTMENT?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.541
- YES! HE LOCKED ME
IN THE BATHROOM.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.309
- BUT YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
OR HEAR HIM.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.410
- NO. NO.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.646
- WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU
ACCUSING MY WIFE OF?

04:38.679 --> 04:41.482
- NOTHING,
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO ASK.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.452
NOW, HAS MACKENZIE
EVER RUN AWAY BEFORE?

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
- NO! NEVER!

04:45.953 --> 04:49.557
I AM TELLING YOU,
SOMEONE TOOK MY DAUGHTER!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.662
- THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.565
I SIGNED FOR THOSE
FOR MRS. SCHWARTZ IN 7-G.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.634
OOH! BRAT BETTER
NOT HAVE BROKEN ANYTHING.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.470
- FREEZE IT.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.005
- THAT'S DEFINITELY MACKENZIE.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.039
- KEEP GOING.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.578
NO SIGN
OF ANY KIDNAPPERS.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.680
GIRL JUST WENT
FOR A JOY SKATE.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.114
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.450
- HOW COULD SHE
PUT US THROUGH THIS,

05:16.484 --> 05:18.352
KNOWING WHAT
HAPPENED TO ELLA?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.853
- NO, IT'S HIM.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.389
I KNOW IT.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.691
MACKENZIE WOULD NEVER
DO THIS BY HERSELF.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.825
- YEAH, WELL,
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO

05:24.858 --> 05:26.026
IS CONTACT
ALL OF HER FRIENDS.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.628
SHE'S PROBABLY
AT ONE OF THEIR HOUSES.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.129
- NO!
- WE JUST MOVED HERE.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.464
SHE HASN'T HAD TIME
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.732
- WHAT ABOUT HER SCHOOL?

05:31.765 --> 05:32.966
- I HOMESCHOOL HER.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.603
- SO SHE NEVER LEAVES
YOUR SIGHT?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.471
- NO, NO, NEVER.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.106
- MAYBE SHE
NEEDED A LITTLE SPACE.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.942
- MACKENZIE IS TEN!
SHE DOESN'T NEED SPACE!

05:41.975 --> 05:44.478
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO WATCH HER AND PROTECT HER,

05:44.512 --> 05:46.414
WHICH I'VE GIVEN UP
MY LIFE TO DO!

05:46.447 --> 05:47.548
- WHAT ABOUT HER COMPUTER?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.116
DOES SHE DO HER SCHOOLWORK
ON IT?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.684
- YES, BUT WE
DON'T LET HER ON IT

05:50.718 --> 05:52.420
WITHOUT SOMEONE
MONITORING HER.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.754
- ACTUALLY...

05:53.787 --> 05:55.856
I LET HER ON IT LAST NIGHT.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.924
- BUT YOU
WERE WATCHING HER, RIGHT?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.726
- THERE WAS A METS GAME ON.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.593
- KEVIN!

05:59.627 --> 06:02.563
- SHE WAS SITTING
RIGHT THERE, PAM.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.131
- ONE HOUR, KEVIN.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.500
I ASKED YOU ONE HOUR
TO WATCH HER.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.473
SHE CLEARED THE HISTORY.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.608
- PRETTY SAVVY FOR A KID
WITH LIMITED COMPUTER ACCESS.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.477
- BUT SOMEONE HAD
TO TEACH HER HOW.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.745
AN INTERNET PREDATOR.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.680
- WE HAVE A TECH
WHO CAN RETRIEVE ANYTHING.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.948
- SO CAN I, ACTUALLY.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.716
WE INSTALLED A PROGRAM
THAT RECORDS

06:22.750 --> 06:24.151
EVERY SITE MACKENZIE GOES ON,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.686
EVERY KEYSTROKE.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.188
- WOW, THAT'S...DILIGENT.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.156
- YEAH.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.493
- THIS IS FROM--
FROM LAST NIGHT.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.595
- "MACK10,"
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MACKENZIE.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.498
- "HEY, MACK,

06:37.531 --> 06:40.067
- WHO'S SHE EMAILING?
WHO'S EDDIE D?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.669
- I DON'T KNOW. PAM?

06:41.702 --> 06:42.736
- "R U FINALLY READY?"

06:42.770 --> 06:44.772
"TOTALLY.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.107
MY SMOTHER IS A NITEMARE."

06:47.140 --> 06:48.876
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.478
- "WISH I CUD HIDE U HERE,

06:50.511 --> 06:53.046
BUT IF MARIE FOUND U,
SHE'D KIL US BOTH."

06:53.080 --> 06:54.682
- [gasps]

06:54.715 --> 06:56.149
- ALL RIGHT, THIS ISN'T NEW.
HE'S BEEN GROOMING HER.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.451
- SEE? I KNEW IT.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.487
- "RUN AWAY WITH ME?"
"YES!

06:59.520 --> 07:01.088
GRAND CENTRAL
2MORROW @ NOON?"

07:01.121 --> 07:02.556
"C U THERE."

07:09.797 --> 07:12.232
- AW, WE'RE TOO LATE.
IT'S FIVE AFTER.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.634
- THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO MEET AT 12:00.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.935
THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ON A TRAIN YET.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.037
LET'S SPLIT UP.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.039
- I NEED YOU TO SHUT IT DOWN
FOR A HALF AN HOUR.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.608
- WHICH TRAIN?
- ALL OF THEM.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.610

07:22.643 --> 07:24.011
- SORRY.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.946
- JUST GIVE ME TWO SECONDS.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.549
SHE'D BE TRAVELING
WITH AN OLDER MAN.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.951
- YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
COME THROUGH HERE EVERY HOUR?

07:30.984 --> 07:33.821
I STOPPED LOOKING
AT FACES YEARS AGO.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.122
- MACKENZIE!

07:35.155 --> 07:36.790
MACKENZIE!

07:36.824 --> 07:38.826

08:07.054 --> 08:09.757
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH MY DAUGHTER!

08:09.790 --> 08:10.891
- LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.294
- I'M SORRY.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.096
- I-I-I WAS SURE
IT WAS HER.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.533
SHE--SHE HAD THE SAME WALK
AS MACKENZIE.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.935
- SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.203
WE SHOULD BE CHECKING
THE TRAINS.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.205
- WE HAVE OFFICERS

09:10.083 --> 09:11.318
RELAX.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.753

09:12.786 --> 09:15.022
DO YOU NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.724

ANYTHING YOU SAY
CAN AND WILL BE USED

09:22.796 --> 09:24.264
AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.465
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

09:25.498 --> 09:27.635
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE,
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.273
- MY NAME IS NOT EDDIE.
- IT'S ERIK WEBER.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.608
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GENIUS

09:34.642 --> 09:35.876
SURFING THE INTERNET
WITH A FAKE NAME.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.110
- ERIK/EDDIE?
YOU COULDN'T COME UP

09:37.144 --> 09:39.713
WITH A DIFFERENT FIRST INITIAL?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.115

09:42.149 --> 09:43.283
- OH, SO IT WAS STRICTLY

09:43.316 --> 09:44.985
AN ONLINE RELATIONSHIP
UNTIL NOW.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.219

SEEMED TO BE CHATTING IT UP

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
LIKE YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.793
- I THOUGHT
SHE WAS A RUNAWAY,

09:52.826 --> 09:53.694
SO I BOUGHT
A COUPLE OF SODAS,

09:53.727 --> 09:55.228
CAUGHT UP WITH HER
IN THE WAITING HALL

09:55.262 --> 09:57.064
TO TALK HER INTO GOING HOME.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.265
- REALLY?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.867
- NO, TO HER PARENTS.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.936
- SO YOU ROAM THE CITY,
SAVING CHILDREN IN PERIL.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.738
IS THAT IT?

10:07.741 --> 10:10.944
- I'VE ALSO BEEN KNOWN TO RESCUE
KITTENS AND LOST PUPPIES.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.614
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.751
ASK MACKENZIE.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.988
- WAS THE MAN YOU WERE
WITH AT GRAND CENTRAL EDDIE D?

10:21.021 --> 10:21.989
- BITE ME.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.123
- OH, STOP IT.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.325
- HONEY, ANSWER HIM.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.862
WAS THAT THE MAN YOU THAT WERE
TALKING TO ON THE INTERNET?

10:28.896 --> 10:31.264
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT YOU TOLD
I WAS A NIGHTMARE?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.801
- HOW DID YOU SEE THAT?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.235
I DELETED IT.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.871
- HE TRICKED YOU INTO RUNNING
AWAY WITH HIM, DIDN'T HE?

10:39.272 --> 10:43.076
- HE DIDN'T TRICK ME.
IT WAS MY IDEA.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.746
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU READ MY EMAIL.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.381
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
NOBODY'S EMAILS ARE PRIVATE.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.482
- MUNCH.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.752
- THERE ARE AGENCIES
THAT MONITOR EVERY WORD WE TYPE.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.988
- OKAY, LISTEN,
IS THIS EDDIE D?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.924
- YES.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.994
HE'S NOT GONNA
GET IN TROUBLE, IS HE?

11:01.028 --> 11:03.096
COME ON,
HE'S REALLY NICE.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.966
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TALK TO STRANGE MEN?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.101
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY CAN DO TO YOU, SWEETIE.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.270
- HE DIDN'T DO ANY SEX THINGS.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.338
- DID HE TOUCH YOU?
- NO!

11:11.371 --> 11:12.405
- ARE YOU SURE?
- STOP!

11:12.439 --> 11:14.875
- MRS. BURTON, CAN WE TALK
OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.409
- NO, I'M
NOT LEAVING MACKENZIE.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.510
NO, NO.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.980
- PAMELA, PLEASE, LET
THESE PEOPLE DO THEIR JOBS.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.050
- NO.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.786
- NOT EVERYONE
IS OUT TO HARM US.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.120
- OKAY.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.789
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE

11:28.822 --> 11:31.058
WITH THE FEMALE DETECTIVE,
THE NICE ONE.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.726
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.161
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT WE'RE TRACING THIS

11:34.194 --> 11:36.997
BACK TO YOU AS WE SPEAK?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.466
- NO.
I DIDN'T WRITE THIS.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.068
- THE LIES AREN'T HELPING YOU
ANY HERE, PAL.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.836
- I'M NOT LYING. LOOK...

11:42.870 --> 11:44.171
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYONE NAMED MARIE.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.773
- OH, I'M BETTING YOU DO.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.140
SOME POOR PATSY
THAT YOU DELUDED

11:47.174 --> 11:49.142
INTO THINKING
THAT SHE WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

11:49.176 --> 11:52.780
WHO'S OH SO UNDERSTANDING ABOUT
YOUR DYSFUNCTIONAL SEX LIFE?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.314
WHO YOU TROT OUT
JUST TO THROW PEOPLE OFF

11:54.347 --> 11:56.016
THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE A PEDOPHILE!

11:56.049 --> 11:58.185
- WOULD YOU STOP
CALLING ME THAT?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.889
I WOULD NEVER HURT A CHILD.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.261
I AM A MEMBER OF C.O.A.P.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.400
- "CITIZENS ORGANIZED
AGAINST PREDATORS."

12:13.433 --> 12:15.002
- IT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD
WATCH GROUP.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.403
I ALSO VOLUNTEER AS A MENTOR.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.438
- SO YOU CAN GET
UNSUPERVISED ACCESS TO KIDS.

12:18.471 --> 12:22.843
- SO A MAN CANNOT
HELP A CHILD WITHOUT...

12:22.876 --> 12:24.211
WITHOUT BEING A SUSPECT?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.915
ARE YOU REALLY THAT JADED?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.850
- WITH PERVERTS LIKE YOU
OUT THERE? YOU BET, I AM.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.184
- MY SISTER...

12:34.487 --> 12:37.257
MY SISTER...

12:37.290 --> 12:41.128
WAS RAPED.

12:41.161 --> 12:46.166
AND IT DESTROYED HER.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.836
AND WHEN I WAS 16,

12:48.869 --> 12:52.906
SHE KILLED HERSELF.

12:52.940 --> 12:57.377
SO WHAT YOU
ARE ACCUSING ME OF...

12:57.410 --> 13:00.047
I WOULD NEVER.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.252
[knock on door]

13:05.285 --> 13:07.187
- DETECTIVES?

13:16.496 --> 13:19.833
MACKENZIE CONFIRMED
THAT ERIK HERE IS, IN FACT,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.335
THE INFAMOUS EDDIE D.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.436
- REALLY?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.905
- YOU DOUBTED IT?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.874
- NOT TOO MAY PEDOPHILES
MAKE GOO-GOO EYES AT YOU

13:26.907 --> 13:27.941
THE WAY HE WAS.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.143
- YOU FELL FOR THAT SHTICK?
HE'S A MANIPULATOR.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.411
- WELL, LET'S TURN THE TABLES.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.445
MACKENZIE'S ONLY TEN.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.147
WHO KNOWS
IF SHE'S EVEN SWEARABLE.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.549
THE D.A. IS GONNA WANT
A FULL CONFESSION.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.186
HOLD UP, LIV.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PULL YOU.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.320
- WHY?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.455
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FINISH
INTERVIEWING MACKENZIE.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.159
HER MOM IS DEMANDING
A PENIS-FREE ENVIRONMENT.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.128
- WELL, WE SAW THAT COMING.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.562
I'LL HANDLE HIM SOLO.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.932
UH, HAVE WE NAILED HIM
ON THE EMAIL TRACE YET?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
- COMPUTER CRIMES GOT US
THE I.P. ADDRESS.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.003
I JUST SENT MUNCH AND FIN
WITH A SUBPOENA

13:56.036 --> 13:57.871
TO GET THE CUSTOMER NAME.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.172
- OKAY.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.877
- [on speaker]
NO DETECTIVE BENSON?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.278
- WHAT A SHAME.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.280
I HAD A HOOK IN HIM.

14:07.314 --> 14:11.218
- YOU KNOW, I NOTICED SHE
WASN'T WEARING A WEDDING RING.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.385
IS SHE SEEING ANYONE?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.922
- REALLY?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.991
SERIOUSLY?
LET'S DROP THE ACT.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.659
- IT'S NOT AN ACT.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.896
- MACKENZIE JUST GAVE YOU UP.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.164
- WHAT?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.066
- SHE ADMITTED YOU'RE
HER ONLINE BOYFRIEND,

14:26.099 --> 14:30.637
THAT YOU TWO WERE
GONNA RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.006
- YOU'RE...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.674
YOU--[laughs]
YOU'RE LYING.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.576
WHY--WHY--WHY--
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.578
- GUESS YOUR HOLD ON HER ISN'T
AS STRONG AS YOU THOUGHT IT WAS.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.313
- NO, YOU TRICKED HER
INTO TELLING YOU

14:40.347 --> 14:41.448
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.450
YOU KNOW, SHE--
SHE IS A MESSED UP KID.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.085
- ERIK...

14:47.087 --> 14:49.589
SO JUST TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.691
THE JUDGE WILL
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

14:51.724 --> 14:53.260
THAT YOU'RE SPARING
THIS POOR CHILD

14:53.293 --> 14:54.361
THE TRAUMA OF A TRIAL.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.029
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

14:56.063 --> 14:57.931
- ERIK, IT'S OVER!

14:57.965 --> 14:59.132
IT'S OVER NOW.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.400
- NO, IT'S NOT!

15:00.433 --> 15:04.004
BECAUSE HER REAL ABUSER
IS STILL OUT THERE.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.539
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW THIS LITTLE GIRL

15:06.573 --> 15:10.577
IS MISERABLE AT HOME.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.480
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING
AT THE PARENTS.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.952
- THEY'RE NOT MY REAL PARENTS.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.353
I'M ADOPTED.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.655
[ball bouncing
off floor and wall]

15:22.689 --> 15:24.224
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
EDDIE?

15:24.257 --> 15:28.361
- NO, THE LARD-ASS CASEWORKER
WHO DROPPED ME THERE.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.463
THEY ADOPTED ME,
LIKE, A YEAR AGO.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.401
- WHERE WERE YOU BEFORE THAT?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.369
- BUNCH OF PLACES.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.205
FOSTER HOMES.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.272
- HOW WERE THOSE?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.608
- THEY SUCKED.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.179
- IS THAT WHERE YOU
MET EDDIE D?

15:46.213 --> 15:49.182
[ball bounces away]

15:49.216 --> 15:51.051
I TAKE THAT AS A YES.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.585
WAS HE YOUR FOSTER FATHER?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.054
- NO.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.555
- CASEWORKER?

15:59.526 --> 16:05.065
MACK, WAS HE...
WAS HE YOUR MENTOR?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.033
- WHAT'S THAT?

16:06.066 --> 16:10.770
- SOMEBODY WHO
HELPS YOU WITH YOUR HOMEWORK

16:10.803 --> 16:13.406
OR TEACHES YOU THINGS.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.509
- YEAH.
HE TAUGHT ME STUFF,

16:16.543 --> 16:17.510
BUT I TAUGHT HIM MORE.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.711
- LIKE WHAT?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.480
- HOW TO WRESTLE.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.317
- REALLY?

16:24.351 --> 16:26.386
DID YOU GUYS WRESTLE A LOT?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.323
- YEAH.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.991
[crayon scraping]

16:33.326 --> 16:35.195
- DID HE EVER HURT YOU?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.597
- DUH.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.332
IT'S WRESTLING.

16:39.366 --> 16:43.536
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.338
- WHERE DID HE HURT YOU?

16:45.372 --> 16:48.441
- ONCE HE TWISTED
MY ARM REAL BAD,

16:48.475 --> 16:49.742
BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.044
[crayon snaps]

16:51.078 --> 16:52.412
- OH.

16:55.482 --> 16:59.686
WHERE'D YOU GUYS WRESTLE?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.188
- IN THE BEDROOM.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.058
- WHOSE BEDROOM?

17:05.092 --> 17:09.262
MACK, WHOSE BEDROOM?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.536
[crayon scraping faster]

17:18.438 --> 17:21.208
- MARIE, WE TRACED
THE SOLICITATION OF A MINOR

17:21.241 --> 17:22.675
TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.377
- NO FRIGGING WAY.
IT WASN'T ME.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.213
- WE THINK IT WAS YOUR PAL,
ERIK WEBER.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.280
- WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

17:27.314 --> 17:29.449
- MAYBE YOU KNOW HIM
BY HIS SCREEN NAME, EDDIE D?

17:29.482 --> 17:31.084
- HUH?
- THIS GUY.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.385
HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

17:32.419 --> 17:33.520
- I WISH.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.589
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.426
- "EDDIE DANGEROUS
WITH A 'D.'"

17:39.459 --> 17:40.727
WHOSE IS THIS?

17:44.697 --> 17:47.334
- WESLEY!
MARCH YOUR BUTT OUT HERE.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.605
- YOU'RE EDDIE D?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.674
- THAT'S JUST
MY SCREEN NAME.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.409
- AND MACKENZIE'S
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

17:56.443 --> 17:57.844
- NO. MACK'S MY BEST FRIEND.

17:57.877 --> 17:58.945
- THAT'S WHO
ALL THIS IS ABOUT?

17:58.978 --> 18:02.215
I SHOULDA KNOWN WHEN THE SCHOOL
CALLED THIS MORNING.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.751
THEY CAUGHT HIM
TRYING TO SNEAK OUT.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.419
SHE PUT YOU UP TO THIS,
DIDN'T SHE?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.255
- YOU GUYS WERE GONNA
RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.590
- LIKE YOU GOT IT
SO BAD HERE.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.193
I TOLD YOU THAT GIRL
WAS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.627
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER?

18:14.661 --> 18:16.363
- WHY IS THAT?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.331
- I'VE BEEN TAKING
IN FOSTER KIDS FOR 15 YEARS.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.532
MACKENZIE WAS THE WORST.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.268
NOTHING BUT BACK TALK--
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.502
MACK WAS THE BEST.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.437
YOU WERE ALWAYS MEAN
TO HER FOR NO REASON.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.839
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO WAS EVER NICE TO ME.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.641
- MACKENZIE, WHY DID YOU LIE

18:28.675 --> 18:30.577
ABOUT THE MAN
IN THE TRAIN STATION?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.612
- I COULDN'T SNITCH
ON WESLEY.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.914
IF MARIE FOUND OUT,
SHE WOULD KILL HIM.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.485
- SO THIS WAS ALL BECAUSE
YOU MISSED YOUR FOSTER BROTHER.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.687
- THEY WON'T LET ME SEE HIM.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.289
OKAY? IT'S NOT FAIR.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.924
- SWEETIE, WE JUST WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A FRESH START.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.693
AREN'T YOU HAPPY WITH US?

18:46.726 --> 18:47.794
- PAM.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.931
I APOLOGIZE
FOR WASTING YOUR TIME.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.835
- WELL, IT WASN'T MY TIME SO
MUCH AS THE DOZENS OF OFFICERS

18:55.868 --> 18:56.969
WHO COMBED THE CITY FOR HER,

18:57.003 --> 18:59.639
AND THE FOUR DETECTIVES
WHO WORKED ON THE CASE ALL DAY.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.375
- CAN YOU APOLOGIZE,
MACKENZIE?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.812
- WHY?

19:05.845 --> 19:09.182
- MACKENZIE!

19:11.451 --> 19:14.554
- SORRY.

19:18.258 --> 19:22.529
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

19:22.562 --> 19:26.499
I'M SORRY THAT I PUT YOU
THROUGH THE WRINGER.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.901
- WELL, YOU WERE
JUST DOING YOUR JOB.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.638
VERY IMPRESSIVELY,
I MIGHT ADD.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.806
- I'M, UH...I'M SURE YOU'RE
ANXIOUS TO GET OUT OF HERE,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.475
SO HAVE A GOOD ONE.

19:35.508 --> 19:40.247
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME, UM...

19:40.280 --> 19:43.516
YOU COULD BUY ME
A CUP OF COFFEE.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.617
- [laughs]

19:44.651 --> 19:46.219
WELL, I, UH...

19:46.253 --> 19:48.721
I DON'T MIX BUSINESS AND...

19:48.755 --> 19:49.856
YOU KNOW.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.857
- I'M NOT BUSINESS ANYMORE.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.925
YOU CLEARED ME, RIGHT?
SO...

19:52.959 --> 19:54.761
- [laughs]

19:54.794 --> 19:57.230
- I'M TOLD
I'M A NICE GUY, AND...

19:57.264 --> 19:58.765
I'M STEADILY EMPLOYED.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.467
- IT'S VERY TEMPTING,
BUT I'M--

20:00.500 --> 20:02.235
I'M STILL GONNA HAVE
TO SAY NO.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.237
SO IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.405
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.706
- THE ELEVATORS
ARE OVER THERE.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.375
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.813
THAT WAS TOTALLY WEIRD.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.448
SUSPECT JUST ASKED ME OUT.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.516
- WELL, THIS IS WEIRDER.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.918
UNI JUST FOUND THIS
IN THE KIDS' INTERVIEW ROOM.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.354
- "OLIVIA, I CAN'T TALK
WITH THEM HERE.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.489
"I KNOW THEY ARE
SPYING ON ME.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.923
"THEY HURT ME.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.959
"THEY PUT THINGS INSIDE ME
TO CONTROL ME.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.996
PLEASE HELP ME. MACK."

20:30.029 --> 20:33.366
- WHAT THE HELL
DID WE SEND THIS KID HOME TO?

20:38.405 --> 20:41.508
- IT'S A CRY FOR HELP.
WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.042
- WELL, DON'T FORGET
WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.143
- STAGED HER OWN KIDNAPPING.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.646
- LOOK, SHE'S BEEN LOCKED UP
WITH A HELICOPTER MOM

20:46.679 --> 20:47.680
FOR A YEAR NOW.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.450
THIS COULD JUST BE
HER LATEST BID FOR FREEDOM.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.385
- "THEY HURT ME."

20:52.419 --> 20:53.820
WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.054
- OTHER THAN THE BAND-AID,

20:55.087 --> 20:56.989
I DIDN'T SEE ANY MARKS
OR BRUISES ON HER.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.626
- THEY PUT THINGS INSIDE HER
TO CONTROL HER?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.294
- I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

21:01.328 --> 21:02.895
BUT IT SOUNDS A LITTLE
PARANOID/DELUSIONAL, EVEN TO ME.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.897
- AND IF THEY ARE DOING
SOMETHING TO HER?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.333
WHAT DO WE DO, WE JUST WAIT

21:06.366 --> 21:07.567
UNTIL SHE WINDS UP
IN THE HOSPITAL

21:07.600 --> 21:08.768
OR IN THE MORGUE?

21:08.801 --> 21:12.405
- OKAY, WHILE THE BURTONS'
FIRST DAUGHTER WAS NEVER FOUND,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.641
DO WE KNOW IF THEY WERE CLEARED
OF ANY INVOLVEMENT?

21:14.674 --> 21:15.942
- PULL THE COLD CASE.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.310
- IF THEY ARE HURTING HER,

21:17.344 --> 21:19.679
WE CAN'T LET HER
SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT THERE.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.418
- MACKENZIE WAS
OFFICIALLY A RUNAWAY.

21:25.452 --> 21:29.322
I SUPPOSE THAT JUSTIFIES A VISIT
BY HOME SERVICES.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.957
- IT'S AFTER 9:30.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.759
WE'VE ALL HAD A HARD DAY.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.361
CAN'T THIS WAIT
UNTIL THE MORNING?

21:34.394 --> 21:35.962
- NO, I NEED
TO INSPECT THE PREMISES

21:35.995 --> 21:37.764
AND INTERVIEW
ALL FAMILY MEMBERS TONIGHT.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.500
- THE VISIT WAS TRIGGERED
AFTER WE FILED OUR REPORT.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.701
IT'S COMPLETELY ROUTINE.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.039
- YOU THINK
I'M AN UNFIT MOTHER.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.908
- I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING, MA'AM.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.344
I AM JUST HERE TO CHECK
ON THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.613
- OKAY, OF COURSE.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.781
WHATEVER...
[clears throat]

21:54.814 --> 21:56.048
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.918
- WHY DON'T WE START
WITH A TOUR OF THE HOUSE?

21:58.951 --> 21:59.986
WHERE ARE THE BEDROOMS?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.621
- I'LL KEEP
MACKENZIE COMPANY.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.623
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, THEY'RE THIS WAY,

22:03.656 --> 22:04.791
BUT IT'S
ALMOST HER BEDTIME.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.025
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.527
I WILL TRY AND MAKE THIS
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.895
- OKAY, UM...

22:10.830 --> 22:13.466
- I GOT YOUR NOTE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.001
- I CAN'T TALK.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.469
SHE'S LISTENING.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.738
- NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE'S WITH MS. WHITE.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.808
NOW, YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO YOU,

22:21.841 --> 22:24.043
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN DANGER,
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT OF HERE.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.613
- NO MATTER WHERE I GO,
SHE'LL FIND ME.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.048
- MACKENZIE,
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET HER.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.519
NOW, YOU SAID IN YOUR NOTE

22:32.552 --> 22:35.788
THAT THEY PUT
SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.424
WHAT WAS IT?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.959
- A COMPUTER CHIP.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.963
- MACKENZIE.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.798
- IT HAS ALL
MY INFORMATION ON IT.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.534
IT KNOWS EVERYWHERE I GO.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.068
THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND ME
YESTERDAY.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.803
OKAY? I CAN'T HIDE.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.540
- THEY DIDN'T FIND YOU,
WE DID.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.843
AND THERE'S NO COMPUTER CHIP
INSIDE YOU.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.177
- THERE IS!

22:58.210 --> 22:59.579
LOOK.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.584
- LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT A SHOT.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.652
- IT WAS IN A SHOT.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.788
THAT'S HOW DR. ZAYDOK
PUT IT IN.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.423
- LOOK...
- IT ITCHES.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.124
- THERE'S NOTHING
IN YOUR ARM.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.661
AND THEY PROBABLY TOLD YOU THAT
SO YOU WOULD BEHAVE.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.630
- NO! OKAY, I'M NOT LYING.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.666
IT'S FOR REAL.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.935
PLEASE, JUST FEEL IT.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.971
- IT'S TINY...

23:25.004 --> 23:27.540
WHAT IS THAT?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.075
- I TOLD YOU.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.078
A COMPUTER CHIP.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.620
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S AN RFID CHIP--

23:40.653 --> 23:42.689
RADIO FREQUENCY
IDENTIFICATION.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.856
- LIKE THEY PUT IN DOGS.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.825
- IT'S THE SAME
BASIC TECHNOLOGY.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.059
- SO THE BURTONS CAN TRACK

23:47.093 --> 23:48.995
EVERY SINGLE MOVE
THEIR DAUGHTER MAKES?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.563
- NOT YET.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.065
IN THE FUTURE, CHIPS WILL BE
EQUIPPED WITH GPS,

23:53.099 --> 23:55.535
BUT FOR NOW, THEY SIMPLY CARRY
A 16-DIGIT NUMBER

23:55.568 --> 23:56.603
UNIQUE TO EACH CLIENT.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.472
- SO WHY WOULD THE BURTONS
FREAK THEIR KID OUT NOW

23:59.506 --> 24:01.674
IF THEY CAN'T EVEN PUT HER
UNDER SURVEILLANCE YET?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.543
- TO SAVE HER LIFE.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.844
IF SHE WERE
EVER IN AN ACCIDENT,

24:04.877 --> 24:06.245
THE HOSPITAL COULD SCAN
THE IMPLANT

24:06.278 --> 24:07.980
AND RETRIEVE VALUABLE
MEDICAL INFORMATION.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.882
- SO CAN
ANY THIRD-RATE HACKER,

24:09.916 --> 24:11.584
OR UNCLE SAM
FOR THAT MATTER.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.952
HOW MUCH
PRIVATE INFORMATION

24:12.985 --> 24:14.186
CAN YOU PUT
IN THESE CHIPS?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.955
- THE APPLICATIONS
ARE UNLIMITED.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.790
IN THE FUTURE,
WE'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK CHILDREN,

24:17.824 --> 24:20.693
THE ELDERLY, CRIMINALS,
IMMIGRANTS.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.861
- WELCOME TO
THE NEW WORLD ORDER.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.731
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, NOBODY
FORCED MACKENZIE INTO THIS.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.032
I DON'T
DO ANY IMPLANTATIONS

24:26.065 --> 24:28.868
ON CHILDREN
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.571
- HOW COULD YOU PUT THAT INSIDE
YOUR CHILD WITHOUT HER CONSENT?

24:31.604 --> 24:33.973
- I DIDN'T.
SHE WANTED IT.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.643
- MACKENZIE, IS THAT TRUE?

24:36.676 --> 24:38.745
- I HAD TO SAY I DID.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.548
IF I DIDN'T, SHE'D NEVER LET ME
GO OUTSIDE AGAIN.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.083
- KIDDO, YOU WERE
NOT BEING PUNISHED.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.553
- SWEETIE...HONEY.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.688
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.557
I JUST WANT
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.158
- [crying]
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.960
YOU JUST WANT ELLA BACK.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.228
- MACKENZIE!

24:56.262 --> 24:57.730
- MR. BURTON, MAY I?

25:03.703 --> 25:06.072
I DON'T THINK PUTTING THAT CHIP
IN YOU WAS RIGHT.

25:08.140 --> 25:13.780
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING

25:13.813 --> 25:17.183
TO PURPOSELY HURT YOU.
HUH?

25:18.585 --> 25:20.853
THEY SEEM
TO REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

25:20.887 --> 25:24.591
- [crying]
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.560
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
THEY PICKED ME.

25:27.594 --> 25:31.097
- SWEETIE, THEY MADE A DOLL
TO LOOK LIKE YOU, RIGHT?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.265
- NO, IT'S NOT.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.067
IT WAS ELLA'S.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.769
THEY MADE IT
TO LOOK LIKE HER,

25:36.803 --> 25:38.170
AND THEY DID
THE SAME THING TO ME.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.273
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.980
THEY MAKE ME
WEAR HER CLOTHES.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.116
THEY CUT MY HAIR LIKE HERS.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.218
- THIS IS ELLA?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.320
- THIS IS THE REAL ME.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.790
- THEY DYE YOUR HAIR?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.661
- AND THEY MADE ME HAVE
AN OPERATION.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.097
- THEY GAVE YOU A NOSE JOB?

26:05.131 --> 26:07.099
- IT REALLY HURT.

26:14.841 --> 26:18.110
- AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT MACKENZIE HAD A NOSE JOB?

26:18.144 --> 26:22.281
- SHE BROKE IT YEARS AGO
IN A SKATEBOARDING ACCIDENT.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.684
HER FOSTER PARENTS DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.219
- IT CAUSED
A DEVIATED SEPTUM.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.355
WE GOT IT FIXED FOR HER.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.289
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?

26:30.322 --> 26:33.325
- IT WAS AN UNNECESSARY
COSMETIC SURGERY.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.863
- EXCUSE ME, IF GIVING A CHILD
A NOSE JOB IS A CRIME,

26:36.896 --> 26:38.264
YOU'D HAVE TO ARREST
HALF THE PARENTS

26:38.297 --> 26:39.666
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.000
- SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE PLASTIC SURGERIES

26:41.033 --> 26:42.234
PLANNED FOR HER?
- NO!

26:42.268 --> 26:43.402
OF COURSE NOT.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.104
- I GUESS YOU DON'T
REALLY NEED IT,

26:45.137 --> 26:46.372
CONSIDERING YOU'VE
ALREADY TURNED MACKENZIE

26:46.405 --> 26:48.407
INTO A PERFECT REPLICA
OF YOUR REAL DAUGHTER.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.844
- MACKENZIE IS
OUR REAL DAUGHTER TOO.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.813
WE LOVE HER
JUST AS MUCH AS ELLA.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.114
- WELL, YOU GOT A FUNNY WAY
OF SHOWING IT.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.316
DYEING HER HAIR?

26:57.349 --> 26:59.251
MAKING
HER WEAR ELLA'S CLOTHES?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.853
- THEY HAPPEN TO FIT.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.722
YOU THINK
IT'S ABUSIVE TO HAVE HER WEAR

27:02.755 --> 27:04.256
PERFECTLY GOOD
HAND-ME-DOWNS?

27:04.290 --> 27:07.426
- I THINK THAT IT'S SICK
TO CHERRY-PICK THROUGH ORPHANS,

27:07.459 --> 27:09.962
LOOKING FOR A PHOTO-DOUBLE
REPLACEMENT DAUGHTER.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.398
- I LOVE ELLA!

27:12.431 --> 27:15.201
- YOU MEAN MACKENZIE.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.706
- [crying] NO.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.041
SHE DOESN'T.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.843
- OF COURSE I DO.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.113
OH, MACKENZIE,
OF COURSE I DO.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.180
- I, UM...

27:28.214 --> 27:32.852
I THINK
YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW.

27:32.885 --> 27:37.156
- CAN'T YOU SEE THAT LITTLE GIRL
IS MISERABLE?

27:37.189 --> 27:39.959
[Mackenzie crying]

27:39.992 --> 27:45.131
- YOU WILL TAKE MY DAUGHTER
AWAY FROM ME OVER MY DEAD BODY.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.005
- WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED

27:53.039 --> 27:55.074
TO THE BURTONS'
FIRST DAUGHTER, ELLA?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.375
- THEY WERE STAYING IN A CABIN

27:56.408 --> 27:58.144
UP THE MOUNTAIN
WHEN ELLA DISAPPEARED.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.712
- ANY SUSPECTS?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.247
- THEY WERE CONVINCED
IT WAS A CAMPER

28:01.280 --> 28:02.849
WHO TRIED
TO TAKE PICTURES OF ELLA

28:02.882 --> 28:04.450
THE DAY BEFORE
ON A HIKING TRAIL,

28:04.483 --> 28:06.385
BUT I CLEARED HIM.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.254
- YOU LOOK AT ANYONE ELSE?

28:08.287 --> 28:09.922
- THE DAY IT HAPPENED,

28:09.956 --> 28:11.958
THE BURTONS SAID
A LITTLE RED-HAIRED GIRL

28:11.991 --> 28:13.893
CAME BY AND ASKED
IF ELLA COULD COME PLAY.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.964
- SAYS HERE THE MOM WENT LOOKING
FOR HER 20 MINUTES LATER,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.999
FOUND THE RED-HEAD
CLIMBING OUT OF A GULLY?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.068
- NO ELLA.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.904
GIRL TOLD THE MOM SHE RAN HOME
TEN MINUTES BEFORE.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.039
- YOU EVER CHECK OUT
THE RED-HEAD'S DAD?

28:27.073 --> 28:30.042
- WE CHECKED OUT EVERY CABIN
IN A 30-MILE RADIUS.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.978
RED-HAIRED GIRL
DIDN'T EXIST.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.813
I COULD NEVER PROVE IT,

28:33.846 --> 28:35.948
BUT I THINK
THE BURTONS KILLED ELLA.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.158
- IT WAS THE LAST DAY
OF YOUR VACATION.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.426
YOU WENT FISHING
ON THE LAKE,

28:47.459 --> 28:51.263
LEAVING YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER
COOPED UP IN THAT REMOTE CABIN.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.932
- THEY WEREN'T COOPED UP.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.533
THEY'D BEEN HIKING
AND SWIMMING.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.402
IN FACT, ELLA
HAD THE TIME OF HER LIFE.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.270
- YEAH?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

28:58.304 --> 29:04.243
- KEVIN HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO LIVE WITH THIS GUILT.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.878
- SO TELL ME.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.923
- WHY DID I LET HER
GO WITH THAT GIRL?

29:16.956 --> 29:19.859
- WITH THE RED-HAIRED GIRL.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.293
PAMELA, SHE DOESN'T EXIST.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.900
- I DIDN'T MAKE HER UP!

29:27.934 --> 29:32.805
SHE WAS WEARING GREEN SHORTS
AND AN ORANGE SHIRT,

29:32.839 --> 29:38.010
AND SHE WAS OLDER THAN ELLA,
MAYBE 13 OR 14.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.847
- I NEVER SAW THAT GIRL,

29:40.880 --> 29:44.516
BUT THAT DOES NOT
MEAN THAT PAMELA IS LYING.

29:44.550 --> 29:50.422
- KEVIN, YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ELLA,

29:50.456 --> 29:54.160
BUT YOU CAN STOP HER
FROM DOING IT AGAIN.

29:54.193 --> 29:59.331
- MY WIFE
WOULD NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

29:59.365 --> 30:04.003
- THE PAIN JUST NEVER STOPS,
AND...

30:04.036 --> 30:07.273
SOMETIMES
I JUST START SCREAMING,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.309
AND I CAN'T STOP SCREAMING,
AND...

30:12.511 --> 30:15.848
I STILL--I WAKE UP
CRYING EVERY DAY.

30:15.882 --> 30:21.087
- PAMELA IS
NOT A CHILD KILLER.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.422
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

30:23.455 --> 30:25.491
HOW MUCH SHE CHANGED...

30:28.560 --> 30:34.300
[crying]
WHEN SHE LOST ELLA.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.436
HOW MUCH WE BOTH CHANGED.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.943
SHE USED TO BE...

30:43.976 --> 30:49.381
SOMEONE WHO WAS
SO FULL OF HAPPINESS.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.920
SHE LAUGHED ALL THE TIME.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.025
AND WE WERE...

30:59.058 --> 31:02.228
SO MUCH IN LOVE.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.462
AND NOW...

31:06.432 --> 31:10.136
YOU DON'T RECOVER
FROM THINGS LIKE THIS.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.570
- YOU NEED THIS TO BE OVER.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.140
- IT WILL BE.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.441
- WHERE'S ELLA?

31:15.474 --> 31:16.943
- WHEN WE FIND ELLA.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.644
- YES, WHERE IS SHE?

31:18.677 --> 31:21.113
- THE MAN WITH THE CAMERA,

31:21.147 --> 31:23.482
HE TOOK HER PICTURE
THE DAY BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED,

31:23.515 --> 31:28.454
AND HE HAD THE RED-HEAD GIRL
LURE HER AWAY.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.431
- WHERE'S ELLA'S BODY?

31:39.465 --> 31:42.301
- NO. PLEASE, NO.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.570
NO, I--

31:44.603 --> 31:48.640
GOD, WHY WON'T
ANYONE BELIEVE ME?

31:48.674 --> 31:50.576
SHE'S NOT DEAD!

31:50.609 --> 31:53.312
THE MAN
WITH THE CAMERA TOOK HER,

31:53.345 --> 31:55.948
AND THE POLICE WON'T
TELL ME WHO HE IS,

31:55.982 --> 31:58.417
'CAUSE THEY THINK
I'M GONNA--

32:02.454 --> 32:04.923
IT'S IN THAT FILE.

32:07.393 --> 32:10.229
PLEASE, PLEASE.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.698
PLEASE TELL ME WHO HE IS.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.138
- COME ON, CUTIE PIE, LET ME SEE
THAT MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.172
LET ME SEE IT ONCE.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.273
- TAKE TEN, FOLKS,

32:21.307 --> 32:23.442
WHILE MICKY FINDS A BACKDROP
THAT'S NOT SO CHEESY.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.311
- HEY.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.046
- REMEMBER YOUR OLD FRIENDS,
THE BURTONS?

32:27.079 --> 32:29.148
- OH, YOU
GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.183
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.419
COPS GRILLED ME
FOR 18 HOURS ON THAT.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.222
I WAS ALREADY IN NORTH BERGEN
BY THE TIME THAT GIRL WAS TAKEN.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.356
I GOT WITNESSES.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.425
- WE'RE MORE INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU SAW.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.693
- WHEN YOU RAN INTO THE BURTONS
ON THE HIKING TRAIL,

32:41.727 --> 32:42.861
WERE THEY GETTING ALONG?

32:42.894 --> 32:45.297
DID YOU NOTICE ANY BRUISES
OR INJURIES ON THE DAUGHTER?

32:45.331 --> 32:49.568
- NO. FEEL FREE
TO LOOK FOR YOURSELF.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.603
THAT WAS
DURING MY NATURE PERIOD.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.406
I WAS GONNA
BE THE NEXT ANSEL ADAMS.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.010
BUT THE KIDS
ARE WHERE THE MONEY IS.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.182
GOD, I HATE 'EM.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.717
THERE IT IS.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.153
- FOR A GUY
WHO HATES KIDS,

33:07.186 --> 33:08.720
YOU SEEM PRETTY OBSESSED
WITH THEM.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.789
- PURELY FROM
AN ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.424
- MUNCH, CHECK THIS OUT.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.626
GIRL IN THE BACK
OF THE PICK-UP TRUCK.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.695
- GREEN SHORTS,
ORANGE TOP.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.564
PAMELA'S RED-HEADED GIRL
IS REAL.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.100
- WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION TO HER?
- NONE.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.302
I SHOT THAT IN THE BACK OF
A COUNTRY MART ON MY WAY HOME.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.304
- SAME DAY ELLA
DISAPPEARED.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.073
THE ORIGINAL COPS SEE THIS?

33:27.106 --> 33:28.140
- NO.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.541
UH, ELLA'S
ON A DIFFERENT ROLL.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.043
- DID THEY ASK YOU
IF YOU SAW A GIRL

33:31.077 --> 33:32.178
THAT MATCHED HER DESCRIPTION?

33:32.211 --> 33:34.446
- THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS
TRAVELING WITH A LITTLE GIRL.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.715
I TOLD 'EM
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIDS,

33:36.748 --> 33:38.484
AT LEAST
NONE THAT I KNEW OF.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.586
- DID YOU CATCH
THIS GIRL'S NAME?

33:40.619 --> 33:42.721
- NO NAME.
NO IDEA WHERE'S SHE'S FROM.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.591
- AND OF COURSE MICKY DIDN'T GET
THE LICENSE PLATE IN THE PHOTO.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.559
- YOU KNOW,
IF SHE WAS WORKING

33:47.593 --> 33:50.062
WITH THE MAN WHO TOOK ELLA,
MAYBE HE ABDUCTED HER TOO.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.231
- WELL, LET'S CHECK
THE NATIONAL DATABASE.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.367
THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM
USES SKELETAL MEASUREMENTS.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.303
WE'LL COME UP WITH
A BUNCH OF FALSE POSITIVES,

33:57.336 --> 33:59.705
BUT, HOPEFULLY,
SHE'LL BE IN THERE WITH THEM.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.045
- MMM, NOPE.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.049
I DON'T SEE HER.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.285
- WELL, THEN SHE WAS
NEVER REPORTED MISSING.

34:13.319 --> 34:16.188
UM, BUT LET ME CHECK
A DIFFERENT DATABASE.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.590
WE HAVE
OVER 2,000 ACTIVE CASES

34:18.624 --> 34:20.459
IN THE INNOCENT IMAGES
PROJECT.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.594
- WELL, IF YOU FIND HER
IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY,

34:22.628 --> 34:23.795
YOU NEED TO RUN ELLA.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.432
- SHE'S NEVER SHOWN UP,
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.699
[computer beeping]

34:27.733 --> 34:28.700
- THAT'S HER.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.103
- WE RAIDED A COMPANY
PRODUCING UNDERAGED PORN

34:31.137 --> 34:32.504
BACK IN '02.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.240
SHE WAS 16.

34:34.273 --> 34:37.176
HER NAME IS
DARLA PINNINGTON.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.744
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.456
DARLA PINNINGTON?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.324
- I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF A MASSAGE.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.425
HEY. WAIT YOUR TURN.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.627
- HEY, PAL, HAPPY FUN TIMES
ARE NOW OFFICIALLY OVER.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.629
GET OUT.

34:57.663 --> 35:01.367
- DARLA, WE NEED YOU
TO COME WITH US.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.768
- THAT WAS
A LEGITIMATE MASSAGE.

35:02.801 --> 35:03.835
YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.

35:03.869 --> 35:04.836
- WE'RE NOT
HERE TO ARREST YOU.

35:04.870 --> 35:05.904
WE JUST WANT TO TALK...

35:05.937 --> 35:08.440
ABOUT ELLA?

35:10.842 --> 35:14.346
- I DON'T KNOW ANY ELLA.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.482
- WHY ARE
YOU PROTECTING HIM?

35:16.515 --> 35:18.250
HE ABDUCTED YOU TOO.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.718
HE FORCED YOU INTO PORN.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.853
- NOBODY ABDUCTED ME.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.622
NOBODY FORCED ME
TO DO ANYTHING.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.158
I LEFT HOME
WHEN I WAS 15.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.259
I DID WHAT I HAD TO.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.162
- YOU HAVE THREE POPS
FOR PROSTITUTION SINCE THEN.

35:30.196 --> 35:33.199
NOW, YOU DON'T COOPERATE,
WE CAN VIOLATE YOUR PROBATION.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.533
- SO DO IT.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.202
I GOT NOTHING TO TELL YOU.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.603
- DO YOU HAVE A MOTHER?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.438
'CAUSE ELLA'S HAS BEEN GOING
THROUGH HELL

35:39.471 --> 35:41.740
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.576
JUST TELL US IF SHE'S ALIVE.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.581
- AND YOU CAN'T TELL US
ABOUT THIS MYSTERY MAN

35:49.615 --> 35:51.583
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T EXIST,
RIGHT?

35:51.617 --> 35:54.453
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.622
YOU KILLED ELLA.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.889
- NO!

35:57.923 --> 35:58.990
- YOU LURED HER
INTO THAT RAVINE.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.792
- WE WERE JUST PLAYING.
- YOU WERE FOUR YEARS OLDER,

36:00.826 --> 36:02.228
A LOT BIGGER.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.729
YOU HAD A CRAPPY LIFE,
NOBODY EVER LOVED YOU.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.597
YOU WERE SO FILLED WITH HATE,
YOU HAD TO TAKE IT OUT ON HER.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.865
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED!

36:06.898 --> 36:09.468
- PERFECT GIRL
FROM A PERFECT FAMILY.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.702
YOU HATED HER FOR IT,

36:10.736 --> 36:12.371
SO YOU KILLED HER
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.805
- I TRIED TO SAVE HER!

36:13.839 --> 36:15.907
- FROM WHO, DARLA?

36:17.909 --> 36:20.246
SAVE HER FROM WHO?

36:20.279 --> 36:21.813
IT'S OKAY.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.217
IT'S OKAY, JUST TELL US.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.855
- [crying] MY FATHER.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.799
MY MOM LEFT US.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.302
HE COULDN'T STAND BEING
IN THE HOUSE.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.738
HE JUST THREW ME IN THE TRUCK,
AND WE DROVE AROUND FOR WEEKS,

36:46.772 --> 36:47.973
DRUNK THE WHOLE TIME.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.776
HE'D STOP AND SLEEP IT OFF
IN THE WOODS.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.010
[sobbing]

36:52.043 --> 36:53.645
- IS THAT WHERE HE SAW ELLA?

36:53.679 --> 36:57.283
- HE TOLD ME
TO ASK HER TO PLAY.

36:57.316 --> 37:00.252
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO TO HER.

37:00.286 --> 37:02.821
- WHAT WAS THAT?

37:02.854 --> 37:05.457
- MAKE HER BE HIS WIFE.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.793
- SHE WAS TEN.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.762
- I DIDN'T WANNA HELP HIM,

37:10.796 --> 37:13.231
BUT HE WAS MY DADDY.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.471
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

37:19.505 --> 37:22.708
- HE SLAUGHTERED HER.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.343
CAUGHT HER TRYING TO ESCAPE,

37:24.376 --> 37:27.513
STARTED BEATING HER,
WOULDN'T STOP.

37:27.546 --> 37:31.049
SHE KEPT SCREAMING,
"HELP!

37:31.082 --> 37:32.618
HE'S KILLING ME!"

37:32.651 --> 37:35.854
AND I JUST LEFT,
AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.956
- WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN?

37:39.491 --> 37:43.295
- AT OUR FARM.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.564
- DALE'S ALWAYS STAYED
PRETTY MUCH OFF THE GRID,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.499
BUT, STILL, THIS IS PRETTY HARD
TO BELIEVE.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.501
- IT'S EASY ENOUGH
TO HIDE SOMEONE AROUND HERE.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.603
- AND NO ONE'S EVER SEEN HIM
WITH A GIRL?

37:51.637 --> 37:53.305
- NOT SINCE DARLA LEFT.
- GUN!

37:53.339 --> 37:55.073
- DROP THE WEAPON!

37:55.106 --> 37:56.875
- SHERIFF RENSHAW,

37:56.908 --> 37:59.378
WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE
DOING ON MY LAND?

37:59.411 --> 38:00.879
- DROP IT!
GET ON THE GROUND NOW!

38:00.912 --> 38:02.914
- I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN, DALE.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.617
- FOR THE KIDNAPPING
AND MURDER OF ELLA BURTON.

38:05.651 --> 38:08.620
- WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT ONE.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.555
- YOUR DAUGHTER GAVE YOU UP.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.923
- YEAH, DARLA NEVER WAS
RIGHT IN THE HEAD.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.659
TOOK AFTER HER MOTHER.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.893
- THESE DETECTIVES
HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT

38:14.926 --> 38:16.094
FOR YOUR PROPERTY.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.896
- WE'RE GONNA DIG UP
EVERY INCH OF YOUR LAND

38:17.929 --> 38:19.565
UNTIL WE FIND HER BODY.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.072
- EL.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.664
- HEY, IT'S OKAY.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.735
IT'S OKAY.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.637
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

39:01.573 --> 39:04.510
- WHERE ARE YOU TAKING
MY HUSBAND?

39:16.788 --> 39:19.458
- ELLA?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.633
ARE YOU ELLA?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.639
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.774
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.922
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.559
IT'S OKAY.
