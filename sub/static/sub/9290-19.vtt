00:12.000 --> 00:14.480
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.640
Tony, it's me.
We have a problem.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.360
We determined the man who was exposed
to the virus got out of the hotel.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.920
Son of a bitch!
How'd that happen?

00:21.040 --> 00:23.360
He must have slipped out
right before we reinforced the perimeter.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.280
It's likely he had no idea
he'd been exposed.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.240
If we don't find this guy
before he becomes symptomatic...

00:27.320 --> 00:29.160
we might be looking
at an outbreak.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.880
- What do you want?
- To give you your next assignment.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.440
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle,
Regional Director of C. T.U.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.840
- I want him killed.
- This man Saunders has proven...

00:37.920 --> 00:40.240
that he will use this virus
to inflict mass casualties...

00:40.320 --> 00:42.280
if you don't do what he says.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.160
How long am I supposed to
let him hold this country hostage?

00:45.240 --> 00:46.680
Until we catch him.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.480
Saunders called in
with another demand.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.800
- " What does he want now?"
- "He wants you killed."

00:51.920 --> 00:54.240
He's threatened to release the virus
into the main population...

00:54.320 --> 00:56.720
- unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m.
- My God, Jack!

00:56.880 --> 00:59.600
He's proven he'll use the virus.
The president didn't have a choice.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.920
Ryan, I think we found Saunders.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.400
Forty-five minutes ago, he made a call
from an apartment not far from here.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.880
Chase is leading a strike team
over there now.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.840
Good, Jack.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.960
- There's no one here.
- Saunders, why are you doing this?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.040
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.840
A van will be arriving shortly.
Leave Chappelle's body with the driver.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.920
Sorry, Ryan, we gotta do this.
Get on your knees.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.960
Sorry we let you down.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.600
God forgive me.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.440
The following takes place
between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.960
He's clean. There's no tracker.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.720
If you try to follow us,
Saunders will release the virus.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.280
- Wayne Palmer.
- "This is Jack Bauer."

03:32.400 --> 03:35.560
Chappelle's body has just been
picked up by Saunders's people.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.800
Thanks, Jack.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.280
Ryan Chappelle is dead.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.840
I ordered the death
of one of our agents...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.360
one of our finest.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.760
As unthinkable as that was...

04:16.839 --> 04:21.240
I had to buy some time in order
to protect civilian lives.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.760
I will not cave in to any more
of this terrorist's demands.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.400
David, unfortunately we're vulnerable
as long as Saunders has this virus...

04:30.520 --> 04:32.960
and is willing to release it.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.640
So far, over 700 people
have been infected.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.720
And they're all gonna die.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.920
Unless you're willing
to accept more loss of life...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.840
I don't know what else
we can do.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.400
He has us in a corner, David.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.440
Convene the cabinet.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.360
Yes, sir.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.080
- Make sure they get this down in I.T.
- All right.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.120
What'd you find?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.720
We worked up the money trails
that Chappelle had on his system.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.840
Stephen Saunders has been sending
$10,000 a month to his daughter Jane.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.760
- He has a daughter?
- Yeah. Right here on the screen.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.160
She's 19. She lives in Santa Barbara,
and she goes to school there.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.120
Find out where she is now. Call Santa Barbara P.D.
Make sure they're on standby.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.680
Yeah.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.720
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.080
- Jack, what happened?
- Chappelle's dead.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.320
Saunders's people
picked up his body.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.360
Four men, all wearing hoods.
Black van, no plates.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.440
All right, look. I'll see if we can
sat track it.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.800
I already put Adam on it.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.240
Do we have any idea why Saunders
wanted Chappelle dead yet?

05:50.360 --> 05:52.680
I was just about to call you.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.640
We found a thread that
Chappelle was working up on his own.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.920
- Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
- A daughter?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.120
Yeah. The money trail Chappelle
was following leads to a Jane Saunders.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.440
- What do we know about her?
- We're still digging up information.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.360
We know she's 19 years old.
She goes to school in Santa Barbara.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.960
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.880
I was just about to call
to have her picked up.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.880
W-Wait! Tony! Tony!
Don't. That's not the right play.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.800
- Why not?
- Think about it.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.840
We don't know anything about this girl. We
don't know if she knows who her father really is.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.760
Obviously Saunders is gonna do
everything he can to protect his daughter.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.640
So someone's watching her.
If you want to grab her for questioning...

06:24.760 --> 06:26.560
you're gonna have to
do it without him knowing.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.680
Which means we have to conduct a plain-sight
swap. Switch her out with one of our own agents.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.640
Jack, I don't know
that we have the time.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.560
We're gonna have to find an agent who
looks like the girl within the next half hour.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.520
Right now, Saunders
is calling all the shots.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.960
If we don't do something soon,
we're gonna be completely paralyzed.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.880
All right. I'll get started.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.480
Chloe... We need to find
a Jane Saunders look-alike.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.720
I need you to abstract
a physical description...

06:49.840 --> 06:51.680
cross-reference it with our C.T.U. Agents
in regions two and three.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.720
- Okay. When do you need it?
- Right now.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.680
- I just started the file on her.
- Chloe, just do it for me. Please.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
- Dessler.
- Hey, it's me.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.920
- Did you get the test results?
- I won't know if I'm infected for another hour.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
What's taking so long?

07:11.160 --> 07:13.000
They couldn't interpret
the results here.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.400
They had to send everything
back to the lab.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.080
How ya feeling?

07:18.200 --> 07:21.480
I'm, uh... I think I'm okay.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.360
No nosebleeds?
Nothing on your skin?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.280
No.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.120
Look, N.H.S. Has everything
under control here.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.680
I wanna keep busy.
How can I help?

07:33.360 --> 07:36.160
Adam's working on
a citywide containment.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.520
I'll have him split off some
of his workload onto your system.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.480
Open up a socket.
You can help with N.H.S. Deployment.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.520
I'll call you later, okay?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.600
Yeah. Okay.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.840
Michelle's still at the hotel.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.400
I told her you'd send over some
of your system updates for her to work on.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.360
Okay. I'll send them right over.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.240
Where are we on this guy
who escaped from the hotel?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.920
His name is Bill Cole.
He's an insurance sales rep.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.120
We contacted his wife by phone,
but she wasn't being very cooperative.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.160
We did manage to get from her that Cole
came home unusually late and left early.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.240
For work?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.600
Probably. But his office doesn't open
for another half hour.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.360
So, we're looking for him now.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.840
N.H.S. Just arrived,
and they'll quarantine the house, test the wife.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.680
- Okay, who we sending over?
- Chase. He'll be there soon.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.120
Agent Bauer, I have the president for you.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.640
Patch him through.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.559
- Jack.
- Mr. President.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.760
Stephen Saunders... the man who's in control
of the virus... you know him, correct?

08:39.880 --> 08:42.840
Yes, sir. I worked with him a number
of years ago on a mission that you sanctioned.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.880
The Drazen mission in Kosovo.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.400
The last conversation
I had with him...

08:47.520 --> 08:49.440
he said there would be
other demands.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.920
His exact words:
"The main event to come."

08:53.040 --> 08:54.880
You have any idea
what he means by that?

08:54.960 --> 08:59.240
I wish I could tell you, sir. Right now,
Stephen Saunders is in a vengeful state of mind.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.480
Any demands that he makes will be
detrimental to American security.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.320
What I'm asking, Jack...

09:05.400 --> 09:07.840
is what will he do
if I say no to him?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.440
Mr. President, when I worked
with Stephen Saunders...

09:10.560 --> 09:12.400
I never thought
he was capable of mass murder.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.920
Today we know he is.
He still has the virus.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.600
If you don't meet his demands, sir,
I believe that he will continue to release it.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.160
- Thank you, Jack.
- Yes, Mr. President.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.560
Here's the list you want of the top 10 agents
that could double as Jane Saunders.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.520
None of these are in Los Angeles.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.720
I know. The closest
is C.T.U. San Francisco.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.760
Did you put together
a second-tier list?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.680
Yeah.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.840
- You sure this is right?
- Yeah. I double-checked when I saw the results.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.280
- Kim Bauer.
- Yeah, Kim. Could you come up
to my office, please?

10:13.360 --> 10:15.200
- Sure.
- Thanks.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.760
- You're not thinking of using her.
- We don't have a choice.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.800
- Shouldn't you talk to Jack?
- Chloe, I'll take care of it, all right? Thank you.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.760
Hi.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.320
- "Why don't you sit down?"
- Okay.

10:35.440 --> 10:40.720
Kim, we need to question Jane Saunders
without her father knowing about it.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.120
The problem is we're pretty sure
he has somebody watching her.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.120
Fine. What do you
need me to do?

10:46.200 --> 10:49.880
Well, you're the same age,
similar body types...

10:49.960 --> 10:51.800
Your facial features
are different...

10:51.880 --> 10:54.400
but not so different that we couldn't
disguise it from a distance.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.760
You want me to pose
as Jane Saunders.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.320
Well, we have better matches,
but they're too far away from this office.

11:00.440 --> 11:05.240
So, the bottom line is,
you're our best chance.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.120
And we don't have much time. We're still
in the early stages of planning this mission.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.120
But, if all goes according to plan...

11:11.240 --> 11:13.080
it shouldn't be too dangerous.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.600
Now, uh...

11:18.680 --> 11:20.880
- I'm not gonna order you to do this.
- I know.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.920
And I know what's
been going on today.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
And if you had a better option,
I know you'd take it.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.360
So, I'm fine and I'll do it.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.760
- You sure?
- Positive.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.640
Chloe, I'm leaving for Santa Barbara
in a few minutes.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.040
So, you're gonna need to transfer
all my stuff onto your system.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.320
I know everything that's happening.
I already pulled your data.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.160
- Good.
- I think it's only fair that I tell you...

12:01.240 --> 12:03.080
I told Tony I didn't think
you should do this.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.360
I mean, fieldwork
isn't learn as you go.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.000
I'm not doing this to be a field agent, Chloe.
There's no one else.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.960
Yeah. That's why
I didn't fight Tony harder.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.000
Not that he would listen to me anyway.
I'm not so out of it that I don't know...

12:13.160 --> 12:15.200
that he doesn't respect my opinions
on tactical matters.

12:15.320 --> 12:19.200
- Okay. Look, I have to go.
- Okay, I just wanted to let you know how I felt.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.960
And I want you to know
that I'm behind you 110%.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.760
- I really hope nothing bad happens to you.
- Listen, Chloe...

12:24.840 --> 12:26.760
are you coordinating
this operation from inside?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.440
- Of course.
- Okay. Well, maybe you should start prepping.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.040
I bet there's about two dozen agents
still waiting for comm codes.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.080
I like your energy, Kim. Use it.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.680
Adam, could you send me a list of all the personnel
working on theJane Saunders operation?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.560
- I can't do it right now. I'm monitoring Chase.
- Did he find Bill Cole?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.520
Not yet.
He's interrogating Cole's wife.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.400
This thing is out of control.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.040
I already told the people on
the phone that Bill isn't here.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.240
I know. I know.

12:52.360 --> 12:56.440
But when he was here, did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.320
- Was he bleeding from the nose, for instance?
- Not that I saw.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.640
What about rashes, skin irritation,
anything of that sort?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.800
No. Why would you think
that he'd be sick?

13:04.960 --> 13:08.720
He came in contact with some people
who were sick at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.200
When was he at the Chandler Plaza?

13:11.320 --> 13:13.200
Earlier this morning.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.520
No. No, he wasn't.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.880
He was with a client at the office.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.120
He did it again, didn't he?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.040
Bastard did it again.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.720
- Ma'am.
- Then...

13:32.320 --> 13:34.760
I hope he did get something.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.800
- I hope that he dies.
- Please, Mrs. Cole, I need you...

13:36.920 --> 13:39.360
Get out of here. Get out of my way!
How dare you!

13:39.520 --> 13:41.960
- " Mrs. Cole! Mrs. Cole!"
- Get out of my way!

13:42.080 --> 13:44.480
You need to stay calm
because I can't let you leave.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.680
- "Agent Edmunds."
- Yeah.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.160
One of my men just found this.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.800
- Where?
- Wastebasket in the bathroom.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.640
The blood's tacky,
which means it's fresh.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.240
- Then Bill Cole's symptomatic.
- Yeah.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.320
I need you to contact every E.R.
And urgent care facility in a 30-mile radius.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.120
Yes, sir.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.880
Excuse me. I've had a nosebleed
for about an hour. I can't seem to stop it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.480
- Did you put ice on it?
- Yeah. Didn't do anything.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.760
- Then try an E.R. Get it cauterized.
- That'll take too long.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.240
- I gotta go to work.
- "We don't have anything here that'll stop that."

14:18.360 --> 14:21.320
All right. Thanks.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.600
Excuse me.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.160
The swap will take place at the campus library.
She works there in the mornings.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.400
This is a file
of relevant personal data.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.320
All right.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.280
- Chloe, where's Tony?
- He's in the teleconference room with Kim.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.320
Why isn't she working
the satellite track with you?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.760
Uh, you might want
to ask Tony about that.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.840
Once you get into position,
just act naturally.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.760
Try not to look out of place.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.920
- Hey, Jack.
- What are you doing with Kim?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.480
Chloe came up with a list
of potential matches for Jane Saunders.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.080
- Good. So we've got one.
- Yeah. Well, you're not gonna like it.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.600
It's Kim.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.520
- My Kim?
- I'm not crazy about it either.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.160
But she's the only one that matched
both physically and geographically.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.480
- You're not sending her into the field.
- "She can handle it."

15:14.560 --> 15:17.120
- Plus she has a safety net.
- Find someone else, Tony.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.200
Jack, you said yourself, we need to get
Saunders's daughter without him knowing.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.200
- Kim's our best shot at doing that.
- She's not doing it.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.400
It's not up to you.
It's her decision.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.800
Fine. I'll order her
not to do it.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.680
Jack.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.200
She doesn't work for you, Jack!
She works for me!

15:41.280 --> 15:44.000
Don't.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.240
- Dad.
- Get out of here.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.200
- Don't do this.
- We're on a tight schedule.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.880
- Get out now or I'll throw you out!
- "Tony!"

15:52.000 --> 15:55.280
- Move!
- "Jack!"

15:55.360 --> 15:57.360
You talk it over with your father.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.920
If we have to abort this, I want to know now.
I'll be outside.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.520
I know you think you're doing the right thing.
This is not going to happen!

16:06.600 --> 16:09.160
- Somebody has to do it.
- Someone will! Not you!

16:09.280 --> 16:11.520
- I'm the best match!
- You're not a field operative!

16:11.640 --> 16:15.000
I have weapons training. This is decoy work.
Saunders's people won't even come close to me.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.280
You don't know what you're talking about!
If everything was to go right in this scenario...

16:18.360 --> 16:20.200
which is not a chance
I'm willing to take...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.440
You're not taking it! I am!

16:24.320 --> 16:27.240
The reason why you've got this job...
the reason why I gave you this job...

16:27.360 --> 16:29.680
is so that I could
make sure you'd be safe!

16:31.960 --> 16:35.040
I took this job because I wanted it...

16:35.160 --> 16:37.160
not because you wanted me here.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.800
I know that this is hard for you...

16:44.400 --> 16:47.320
but this is not your decision.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.720
This is my job.
Better yet, my duty.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.600
I'm gonna be safe.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.720
But I'm doing it.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
- They ready to go?
- We're all set.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.760
As soon as we get there, they're gonna deal
with your hair and makeup.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.840
Remember, we're not trying
to fool anyone at close range.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.960
We're gonna set you in position
where Saunders's people
can only view you from a distance.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.400
- Is your comm unit getting a clear signal?
- It's fine.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.320
- Kim?
- Yeah.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.880
This is a gun I got for you.
I don't think you're gonna have to use it.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.680
But if you do, don't hesitate.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.560
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.280
- Thanks so much.
- Please, be seated.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.720
Thank you for assembling
on short notice.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.040
You've already been briefed
on the Cordilla virus...

18:38.160 --> 18:39.960
that is now
threatening our cities.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.920
What you don't know is
we have two new developments.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.320
- Wayne.
- First, a vial of that virus has already been released.

18:48.440 --> 18:52.240
The Chandler Plaza Hotel, here in Los Angeles,
was the site of the first attack.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.200
That situation is being addressed.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.520
Secondly, we've discovered
the identity of the perpetrator.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.960
His name is Stephen Saunders,
and he's a former Ml-6 agent.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.160
Now apparently Mr. Saunders
has at least 11 more vials...

19:03.280 --> 19:06.000
and is threatening to release them
unless we meet his demands.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.920
Mr. President, what are those demands?

19:08.040 --> 19:12.040
So far there have been two. The first was
for the president to use the phrase...

19:12.160 --> 19:14.160
"The sky is falling"
in a press conference.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.320
He then demanded that we terminate
one of our own agents.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.400
One of our agents? Why?

19:20.520 --> 19:22.320
We're still looking into that.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.360
What was his response
when you didn't comply?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.200
It devastates me to tell you
that I had no choice but to comply.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.000
A half hour ago, we delivered
this agent's body...

19:37.120 --> 19:38.920
to one of Saunders's representatives.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.120
My God.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.160
Millions of lives are at stake.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.400
I'm gonna need each of your departments
to open your files to C.T.U. Los Angeles.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.040
Give them whatever they need.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.880
Tony, I'm trying to get into
some D.O.D. Files forJack.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.720
I need authorization from Chappelle.
When's he gonna be back?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.720
He's not.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.080
What do you mean?

20:14.600 --> 20:17.040
Could I have
everybody's attention, please?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.960
I'm sorry to have to tell you that...

20:26.680 --> 20:29.520
Ryan Chappelle was killed
in the line of duty about a half an hour ago.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.320
I can't give you any more details.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.760
But, uh, I'll be assuming
Ryan's responsibilities...

20:41.880 --> 20:44.520
until we hear
from Brad Hammond at Division.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.960
There'll be an opportunity to
pay proper respects to Ryan.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.240
- "Kaufman."
- But now is not the time.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.280
Tony, it's Chase on line five!

20:54.440 --> 20:57.680
Thanks.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.000
- Almeida.
- Yeah, it's me.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.880
I'm at Cole's house. We found evidence
he's almost certainly symptomatic.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.160
How many people did he come
in contact with over there?

21:09.240 --> 21:12.360
Just his wife. N.H.S. Is moving her
into isolation right now.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.400
I'll let the teams know.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.960
Tony, transfer me to Kim.
She was running a simulation for me.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.560
Yeah, I gave that to Adam.
Kim's out on assignment right now.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.320
What kind of assignment?

21:22.440 --> 21:25.160
We're pretty sure that Saunders
has his daughter under surveillance...

21:25.240 --> 21:27.240
so Kim's gonna take her place
when we grab her.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.960
Kim is not Field Ops!
What the hell is she doing out there?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.600
I don't want to hear about it, Chase, all right?
Kim was the only match we had available.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.440
There's got to be
other agents you can use.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.400
- What are you thinking?
- No, there aren't! Back off, Chase!

21:40.680 --> 21:42.680
Where is she now?

21:42.800 --> 21:45.280
She's on her way to Santa Barbara
with Jack.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.600
- Jack signed off on this?
- First of all, it's my call.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.880
Secondly, yes, Jack did. But most importantly,
Kim accepted the assignment.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.000
I'll be with the team inside.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.120
I'm gonna transfer you over to Adam.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.080
Fine.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.400
Look, I'm sorry about what happened earlier,
about grabbing you.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.800
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just don't think what you're doing is right.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.600
But I need you to understand something.
In the field, I am in command.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.560
You do what I tell you to do.
Do you understand me?

22:24.040 --> 22:25.800
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.720
Okay, good.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.960
Attempted to reach hotel officials,
the police, even the FBI.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.240
- Yes?
- My nose has been bleeding for almost an hour...

22:38.360 --> 22:40.160
- a-and I can't get it to stop.
- All right.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.560
Have a seat and fill this out.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.680
- How long will that take?
- There are a couple patients ahead of you.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.360
- It shouldn't be too long.
- Thanks.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.320
Contracted some illness.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.280
As to how serious
this illness is...

22:53.360 --> 22:55.360
we have no new information,
and the authorities are not commenting.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.920
We cannot verify this,
but we are hearing...

22:58.080 --> 23:00.440
that whatever is infecting
the people of this hotel...

23:00.520 --> 23:03.120
it is very serious
and possibly deadly.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.600
Body bags have been spotted and rescue workers
are positioned around the Chandler Plaza.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.240
Authorities are not giving any information
regarding the estimated...

23:10.360 --> 23:12.040
- Hey!
- One minute, sir.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.480
No, now!
I need to see a doctor now.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.040
I was at that hotel.
There is something seriously wrong with me.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.160
Oh, my God. You're him.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.400
Hold on. Dr. Joyner...

23:23.520 --> 23:25.880
the man we're supposed
to isolate, he's here!

23:43.360 --> 23:46.160
Yes.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.240
We've just I.D. 'd the body.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.200
- And it's Chappelle?
- "It's confirmed."

23:51.360 --> 23:54.200
- The thumbprint matched the one in his file.
- Good.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.680
- Dump the body.
- Yes, sir.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.920
Did you take care of your problem?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.880
Yes, Chappelle's dead.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.480
C.T.U. Is still gonna try
to find out what he was working up.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.000
Tell Lennox to stay alert.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.600
Make sure he doesn't
let Jane out of his sight.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.960
- Yeah?
- Any problems over there?

24:14.080 --> 24:16.120
No. She's leaving
her apartment now.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.080
- "She's going to work."
- All right.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.640
Stay with her.
The next few hours are crucial.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.600
I'll be here.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.360
Mr. President, we've started
down a slippery slope here...

24:43.480 --> 24:45.680
- and unless we're willing...
- "Cut the euphemisms, Joseph."

24:45.760 --> 24:48.000
What are you trying to say?

24:48.120 --> 24:52.120
Sir, we're concerned you ordered the death
of a high-ranking member of our intelligence...

24:52.240 --> 24:55.120
I don't think we're here to second-guess
actions that have already been taken.

24:55.240 --> 25:00.560
Joseph, no one is more aware than I am
of the moral ambiguity of my decision.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.320
I did it to buy C.T.U.
More time to find Saunders...

25:03.440 --> 25:07.160
and to delay for as long as possible
the slaughter of millions.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.880
I made the decision
to protect their future...

25:11.600 --> 25:13.400
not mine.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.320
Saunders.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.360
I have to take this.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.080
Yes.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.840
I've confirmed the identity
of Chappelle's body, Mr. President.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.760
It will be disposed of respectfully.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.400
We know who you are, Mr. Saunders.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.680
Whatever you're trying to accomplish,
you are going to fail.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.920
Your only chance is to relinquish the virus
and hope we don't find you.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.360
That's not gonna happen.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.520
What is it you want?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.440
To make America clean again.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.240
You see, Mr. President,
the world hates America.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.560
And for good reason.
I won't bother going into the details.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.840
You know better than I
the atrocities your nation commits.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.520
But we're gonna change all that.

26:07.640 --> 26:11.520
You and I together are going to
dismantle the military machine...

26:11.640 --> 26:14.120
that exports its ugliness
across the globe.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.440
And how are "we"
going to do that?

26:16.560 --> 26:18.840
We'll start where the work
gets the dirtiest...

26:18.960 --> 26:21.080
something I know
a little about.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.360
Covert foreign nationals.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.400
In 32 countries across
the Middle East and Asia...

26:25.520 --> 26:28.840
your government employs grade "A"
through "H" intelligence consultants.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.080
They are citizens of the countries
in which they reside.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.200
They're spies,
working against those countries...

26:34.360 --> 26:36.840
at the behest of
the American military machine.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.920
In 45 minutes, I want a list
of their identities...

26:40.040 --> 26:45.680
sent to me by way of a Web site:
Sylviaimports.com.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.600
If you fail to comply...

26:47.720 --> 26:50.160
I will release two vials
of the virus in major cities.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.240
And this time...

26:53.360 --> 26:56.680
they won't be in hotels
where they can be contained.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.200
- Agent Bauer, Rachel Forrester.
- This is Agent Kim Bauer.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.360
- Hi.
- She's gonna be doubling for Jane Saunders.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.920
We've already set up a staging area
outside the library where she works.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.480
- Is it a safe distance away?
- Yes. We won't be detected.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.720
- Is she there yet?
- No. She will be in a few minutes.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.840
Let's go ahead in. Set to go.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.760
Make sure everybody on the block is contacted.
Nobody leaves their house.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.240
Sheriff s department is sending officers over
to patrol a three-block area.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.840
Until they get here, use your men. Excuse me.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.160
- Edmunds.
- Yeah, we found Bill Cole.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.760
- Where?
- He's at an urgent care center not far from you.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.320
- Laurel Canyon and Moorpark.
- Yeah, I know where that is.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.920
Now, once you get over there,
get as much as you can off of Cole.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.960
He's pretty agitated.
You're gonna have to help him focus.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.680
- Tony?
- Yeah?

28:27.800 --> 28:29.840
Is Kim in play yet?

28:29.960 --> 28:33.200
- No, she just landed in Santa Barbara.
- All right. I'll call you.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.520
- "Where's Jane now?"
- "My people have her under"
surveillance in the library...

28:45.640 --> 28:47.440
working behind
the reference desk.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.200
- "How crowded?"
- Ten, 20 people.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.720
One of'em belongs to Saunders. Their orders
are gonna be not to let her out of sight.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.800
I know. We've taken over
the surveillance cameras...

28:54.920 --> 28:56.880
and narrowed down a list
to about five probables.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.200
Get that intel over
to Tony Almeida at C.T.U.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.200
Okay, let's see her.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.440
Remember, Kim, you're not gonna fool
anyone who knows Jane Saunders up close.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.720
- I know.
- The library staff knows what's happening...

29:08.840 --> 29:11.360
but I want you stay at least
10 feet behind the counter.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.680
I want you to keep your head down
as much as possible.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.920
The wig looks darker
than Jane's hair color.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.000
That's the best we could do
on such short notice.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.160
You're gonna have to match
every detail as closely as possible.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.600
Her life depends on it.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.040
Mr. Cole, when you were inside the store...

29:46.120 --> 29:47.680
who did you come in contact with?

29:47.800 --> 29:50.200
- Wh-What do you mean contact?
- Who did you talk to?

29:50.320 --> 29:52.760
Just the pharmacist behind the counter.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.640
How many others? Customers?

29:55.720 --> 29:58.640
Yeah, there were
some other people there.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.600
How many other people were there?

30:03.120 --> 30:06.240
Bill, if we do not identify...

30:06.320 --> 30:08.280
and track down everyone
you have come in contact with...

30:08.400 --> 30:10.280
we are gonna have
a citywide epidemic.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.360
So how many people?

30:14.760 --> 30:17.600
I-l... I don't know.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.960
Think!

30:36.720 --> 30:39.080
That's it.
We're now patched into campus security.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.280
I have no audio for the system.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.080
Okay, we're all up.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.640
Nothing on "B."

30:47.760 --> 30:49.960
Go ahead. Try six.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.760
On your screen, go ahead
and isolate the front desk.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.120
Five is good. Top screen, sir.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.680
- "No. I've no image."
- "That's all we can get from it?"

31:00.800 --> 31:03.080
Okay. See if we can activate it.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.800
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.720
Hey, Jane.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.040
I am so sorry.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.720
- You're not supposed to have drinks in here.
- I'm sorry.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.840
- I-I'll throw it away.
- It's okay.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.920
Start tracking that man in the red shirt.
I want to know everything that he does.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.160
Yes, sir.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.200
Got subject
on camera four right now.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.280
I was just about to replace those.
Here you go.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.720
There you go. Clear.

32:32.720 --> 32:36.480
- No activity.
- What camera you on?

32:36.600 --> 32:39.840
- "The main screen."
- What the hell is taking her so long?

32:39.960 --> 32:43.760
- "Checking all screens now."
- "Where'd subject go?"

32:43.880 --> 32:45.640
- "Nothing on one."
- Come on.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.680
Nothing on two.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.440
- "Any chance he's on four?"
- "Negative."

32:49.600 --> 32:51.400
So, she's coming out on four?

33:19.640 --> 33:21.480
Kim...

33:21.600 --> 33:24.800
there's a man heading for the bookcase
at your 3:00, red shirt.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.760
He might be one of Saunders's men.
I want you to angle away from him slowly.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.200
- Good.
- "We still have subject "Red Shirt"on camera."

33:35.360 --> 33:38.960
We just got off the phone with Chase,
who's with Cole right now.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.240
After Cole left the hotel,
he went to his house in Burbank.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.600
He stopped at a gas station on Riverside Drive,
but it was self-service.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.560
According to what he told the urgent care unit,
and what his wife confirmed...

33:48.680 --> 33:50.800
he didn't become symptomatic
until after he got home.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.000
- The nosebleeds and the sweating?
- Right.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.160
Here's where the ripple effect starts.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.080
At 7:20, he stopped at a pharmacy...

33:57.200 --> 33:59.000
and asked the pharmacist,
Sam Tyler...

33:59.120 --> 34:00.920
for some medication
to stop the bleeding.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.720
There were three other people
inside that pharmacy at the same time.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.720
Right. One of them, Anne Schwartz...

34:05.880 --> 34:08.719
she's been going to the pharmacy for years,
so they had her address on file.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.560
We've sent N.H.S. People to her house.
She has a husband and three children.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.040
- What about the other two customers?
- I.D.'s unknown.

34:15.159 --> 34:17.440
These people could be anywhere,
spreading the disease...

34:17.560 --> 34:20.159
- to anybody they come in contact with.
- "It gets worse."

34:20.280 --> 34:22.120
At the urgent care facility
in Studio City...

34:22.199 --> 34:25.000
there were six patients in the waiting area
when Cole came in...

34:25.080 --> 34:27.960
who left before
the quarantine was put in place.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.760
We're tracking them down, but between them
and the staff at the facility...

34:32.840 --> 34:36.080
we could be looking at up to
75 peoplejust in their immediate families.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.120
If any of these people are in a supermarket
or a mall when they become symptomatic...

34:41.400 --> 34:43.320
this thing's gonna be
impossible to contain.

34:43.440 --> 34:46.199
We need to identify 'em
and find them now.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.239
Also, I need you to coordinate
with N.H.S. And HazMat.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.239
We have to set up a quarantine in two
neighborhoods in the Burbank-Studio City area.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.920
Department heads report to Adam.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.800
While he has time,
have him get on the exterior cams.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.560
Good work, everybody.
It looks like this worked.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.760
Maintain monitoring Kim.
Get me if anything happens.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.920
- You got it.
- " There you go."

35:22.040 --> 35:24.200
- "Three, two, one..."
- Thank you. Good work.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.280
What's going on?
Who are you?

35:59.400 --> 36:02.800
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a federal agent.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.720
You're not in any danger.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.520
What do you want?

36:08.200 --> 36:11.680
We need your help.
We need to get in touch with your father.

36:11.800 --> 36:15.000
Then get in touch with him.
What do you need me for?

36:15.120 --> 36:17.200
We don't know where he is,
and we think you do.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.600
What's this about?

36:22.720 --> 36:24.600
You don't know
who your father really is.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.080
First of all, I hardly know my father.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.280
And whatever this is, I know it's illegal.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.640
You have no right to keep me here!

36:33.720 --> 36:35.560
Release me now!
I haven't done anything wrong!

36:35.640 --> 36:37.600
You better listen to me
very carefully, Jane.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.200
Right now your father is engaged in terrorist
activity against the United States of America.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.320
This morning,
he killed hundreds of people...

36:43.440 --> 36:45.280
and has threatened
to kill thousands more.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.080
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you to believe...

36:48.200 --> 36:50.520
but trust me, you're going to
cooperate with us.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.840
There's a lot at stake,
and there's not a lot of time.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.480
I'm not gonna do anything.
I want to talk to a lawyer.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.640
There's no lawyer.
There's just you and me.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.240
I don't know anything
about my father.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.720
He comes into town twice a year.
I have dinner with him.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.520
- I don't even know where he lives.
- How do you contact him?

37:20.600 --> 37:22.440
I don't. He calls me.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.040
- You're lying to me, Jane.
- I'm not.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.400
Don't try protecting him. You're just gonna
get yourself in a world of trouble.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.880
You're the one in trouble here!
You're the one breaking the law!

37:35.960 --> 37:38.520
Do you think I'm playing
a game here with you?

37:38.640 --> 37:41.120
Hundreds of thousands of people's lives
are on the line!

37:41.240 --> 37:44.640
You have no idea how far
I'm willing to go to acquire your cooperation.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.080
- What are you threatening to do to me?
- Where is your father, Jane?

37:47.160 --> 37:49.200
- I don't know!
- Where is your father?

37:49.320 --> 37:51.760
- Will somebody help me, please?
- Where is your father?

37:51.880 --> 37:53.360
- Jack!
- "What?"

37:53.520 --> 37:55.320
- "Help me, please!"
- Red Shirt is approaching.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.320
Please!

37:58.520 --> 38:00.800
- What's going on?
- He's at the desk.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.280
Kim, don't turn around.
Just stay where you are.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.480
- Where the hell's the librarian?
- Alice, get someone to the reference desk now.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.000
Okay.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.480
- Excuse me.
- Just a minute.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.960
I... I need some help
with, uh, finding a book.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.200
Uh, just one second.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.200
Okay, sweetheart,
you're doing great.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.120
Just stay calm
until we check this guy out.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.840
Give me a close-up of
the gentleman in the red shirt.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.000
- Can I get some help here?
- I'll be with you in a minute.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.640
Okay, Kim, I want you to slowly get up
and try and make your way...

38:44.720 --> 38:48.040
to the bookshelves in front of you.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.880
Stay out of his eye line until
we find out who this guy is.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.880
- Maintain a constant visual
on her from monitor three.
- Get camera three on Kim.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.080
Coming over to camera three.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.920
No, they're panning off her.
Get me another angle.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.560
- "There is no other angle."
- What's going on?

39:39.720 --> 39:43.480
Jack, we had her a second ago. Camera three
should be panning back on her in a few seconds.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.720
You work here, don't you?

39:53.840 --> 39:56.320
- Yeah.
- Could you, uh, help me find
something in this aisle?

39:56.440 --> 39:59.240
Yeah, no problem.
What is it that you need?

39:59.320 --> 40:02.440
Call for help, I'll kill you right now!

40:02.560 --> 40:05.360
- What?
- Who has Jane Saunders?

40:05.440 --> 40:08.480
- Who has Jane Saunders?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.360
Let's go. Come on.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.600
Back in range in three seconds. Three's up.

40:17.720 --> 40:20.360
- Where the hell is she? Kim.
- "Pick up two."

40:20.480 --> 40:22.880
- Damn it!
- Team two, go! Go!

40:56.560 --> 40:58.400
Get down! Down!

41:10.680 --> 41:12.920
Kim!

41:15.920 --> 41:19.760
"Kim! Step back! Step back!"

41:22.360 --> 41:25.000
Radio back.
Tell them subject is down.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.680
Saunders is gonna know
we have his daughter.
