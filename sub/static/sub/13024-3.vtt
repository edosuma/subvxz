01:21.654 --> 01:24.406
Sire, the beast is almost to Arus.

01:24.490 --> 01:28.327
This Quintessence gives me
so much power,

01:28.410 --> 01:31.705
I could fight the paladins myself.

01:31.789 --> 01:33.290
There is no need.

01:33.374 --> 01:37.294
My creature will destroy them
and capture the Voltron lions for you.

01:37.378 --> 01:42.049
<i>Then, the most powerful weapon
in the universe will be ours.</i>

01:42.925 --> 01:47.012
<i>Great job training today, guys.
We're really getting the hang of Voltron.</i>

01:47.555 --> 01:50.933
Seriously, how far do you think my lion
kicked that broken alien ship?

01:51.016 --> 01:52.601
Must have been like a mile!

01:52.685 --> 01:56.689
Yeah, that'll come in handy when the Galra
challenges Voltron to a soccer match.

01:56.772 --> 01:59.900
Hey, I did something cool
and you can't handle it. I get it.

01:59.984 --> 02:04.613
- Your kick ruined our balance. We fell.
- That falling part was Hunk's fault.

02:04.697 --> 02:05.573
Hey!

02:05.656 --> 02:08.826
All right, save your energy
for fighting Zarkon.

02:09.827 --> 02:12.288
Hello, guys!
How was the Voltron workout?

02:12.371 --> 02:13.747
We're getting there.

02:13.831 --> 02:17.376
Are you and Allura almost done fixing
the Castle so we can leave this planet?

02:17.459 --> 02:19.503
I feel like we're sitting ducks
here on Arus.

02:19.587 --> 02:20.588
Just about.

02:20.671 --> 02:23.591
In the meantime, to get your minds off
those duck seats you're worried about,

02:23.674 --> 02:26.844
I made you guys an authentic
ancient paladin lunch!

02:28.887 --> 02:32.141
Coran, you just got me hooked on that goo
and now you're switching it up?

02:32.224 --> 02:33.726
This is packed with nutrients.

02:34.768 --> 02:37.229
Oh, it smells disgusting!

02:37.313 --> 02:40.482
I know!
That's how you know it's healthy!

02:40.566 --> 02:43.381
Coran, we're on a planet
now with fresh herbs,

02:43.382 --> 02:46.196
spices, and whatever
this thing is. A tuber?

02:46.280 --> 02:47.197
If you'll excuse me,

02:47.198 --> 02:49.950
I'm going to head back to the
kitchen and spice things up.

02:51.577 --> 02:52.786
Where's Pidge?

02:52.870 --> 02:55.789
He's probably checking on those
prisoners we rescued from Zarkon.

02:55.873 --> 02:58.208
They'll all be waking soon
in the infirmary.

02:59.251 --> 03:01.587
Open the hatch. Food lion coming in!

03:05.466 --> 03:08.218
No. Just... no.

03:08.302 --> 03:10.095
You don't know what you're missing!

03:15.726 --> 03:17.061
You're as anxious as me.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.582
These aliens we saved know something
about my family.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.067
- They have to!
- I hope so.

03:23.150 --> 03:25.152
They recognized you, didn't they?

03:25.235 --> 03:27.780
They called you "Champion."
What does that even mean?

03:28.447 --> 03:31.825
I don't know. I can't remember
very much from that time.

03:31.909 --> 03:34.661
But the way those guys looked at me
when we freed them...

03:34.745 --> 03:36.080
I don't know if I want to find out.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.542
Uh?

03:52.930 --> 03:56.183
- They like the paladin lunch!
- I don't want to talk about it.

03:56.266 --> 03:59.644
I just got the final nebulon
booster working. We should be

03:59.645 --> 04:03.023
able to leave Planet Arus tomorrow
and take the fight to Zarkon.

04:04.441 --> 04:05.401
Huh?

04:11.740 --> 04:12.991
What is that?

04:13.075 --> 04:15.953
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's a local Arusian.

04:17.245 --> 04:20.040
He's approaching the Castle.

04:24.128 --> 04:25.838
Aw!

04:25.921 --> 04:28.966
- Doesn't look too dangerous.
- You never know.

04:29.049 --> 04:34.513
No. Alteans believe in peace first.
Let's go welcome them.

04:34.596 --> 04:36.098
That's adorable.

04:36.181 --> 04:38.267
Hey, maybe we can knit him
a little sweater!

04:38.350 --> 04:40.018
I'm not taking any chances.

04:50.696 --> 04:53.907
Greetings. We know you're there.

04:53.991 --> 04:55.576
No harm will come to you.

04:55.659 --> 04:58.245
Aw!

04:58.328 --> 05:00.998
Wait! He could be dangerous.
Drop your weapon!

05:01.081 --> 05:03.000
No one takes Klaizap's weapon!

05:03.083 --> 05:08.672
Keith, put that away! Please, kind sir,
accept my most humble apologies.

05:08.756 --> 05:09.631
Huh?

05:09.715 --> 05:14.928
I am Klaizap, bravest of our warriors.
Our village is over Gazrel Hill.

05:15.012 --> 05:16.638
I come seeking answers

05:16.722 --> 05:20.309
as to why the Lion Goddess
is angered with her followers.

05:20.392 --> 05:23.103
- Followers?
- Lion Goddess?

05:24.271 --> 05:26.982
The one the ancients spoke of.

05:28.817 --> 05:30.569
What makes you think she's angered?

05:30.652 --> 05:34.239
Destruction is everywhere.
In the past few suns,

05:34.323 --> 05:39.036
fire has rained from the heavens
and a giant has danced in the sky.

05:39.119 --> 05:41.663
I think he's talking about Voltron.

05:41.747 --> 05:43.290
Yeah, I got that.

05:43.373 --> 05:46.001
You have not angered
the Lion Goddess.

05:46.543 --> 05:48.045
How can you be certain?

05:48.128 --> 05:51.632
Because I am Allura
and this is my Castle.

05:54.134 --> 05:57.429
Lion Goddess!

05:57.513 --> 05:59.306
Please, bravest warrior,

05:59.389 --> 06:02.267
take us to your village
so that we may meet our neighbors.

06:02.351 --> 06:05.395
What about our mission to get off
this planet and fight Zarkon?

06:05.479 --> 06:08.815
Part of the paladins' mission
is to spread peace and diplomacy.

06:09.399 --> 06:12.027
Arus has been our host for 10,000 years.

06:12.028 --> 06:13.779
These people deserve our thanks.

06:15.864 --> 06:18.867
So, how long were you held
captive by Zarkon?

06:18.951 --> 06:22.496
Some for years. Decades, maybe.

06:22.579 --> 06:26.708
It's hard to tell. Time becomes a blur.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.461
Then you must have been there
when my dad and brother arrived.

06:29.545 --> 06:30.796
Sam and Matt Holt?

06:30.879 --> 06:34.341
I never knew their names,
but I certainly remember

06:34.342 --> 06:37.803
the other two Earthlings
that arrived with Champion.

06:38.387 --> 06:40.973
"Champion."
Why do you keep calling me that?

06:41.056 --> 06:44.893
You really don't remember? Unbelievable!

06:44.977 --> 06:48.814
You were a legendary gladiator,
undefeated in the ring.

06:48.897 --> 06:53.860
You defeated an infamous
Galra gladiator known as Myzax.

06:53.944 --> 06:56.780
That was the day you earned
the name "Champion."

06:56.863 --> 07:00.784
I was there, as was the young Earthling.

07:00.867 --> 07:05.205
<i>We were all prisoners, forced to fight
for the entertainment of Zarkon.</i>

07:05.289 --> 07:07.916
<i>That day, we were set to fight Myzax,</i>

07:08.000 --> 07:12.254
<i>a vile beast many thought
could never be defeated.</i>

07:12.337 --> 07:14.423
<i>Slaughter awaited us all.</i>

07:15.883 --> 07:19.303
<i>This "Matt" was the first of us
sent to fight.</i>

07:20.095 --> 07:22.097
<i>But fate had other plans.</i>

07:26.476 --> 07:30.147
<i>You were so thirsty for blood,
you injured your fellow Earthling.</i>

07:32.608 --> 07:35.736
You attacked my brother? Why?

07:36.236 --> 07:38.238
No, it can't be true.

07:38.322 --> 07:41.742
I was there. We all were.

07:41.825 --> 07:44.244
After my brother was injured,
where was he taken?

07:44.328 --> 07:45.704
I know not.

07:45.787 --> 07:48.248
I don't believe it.
There's got to be more to the story.

07:48.332 --> 07:50.459
I couldn't have hurt my friend.

07:50.542 --> 07:54.296
Wait. That ship we were held captive on
crash-landed on this planet.

07:54.379 --> 07:57.341
They'll have logs of prisoners,
some information.

07:57.424 --> 07:58.926
I'm coming with you.

08:09.269 --> 08:10.896
Oh, Lion Goddess,

08:10.979 --> 08:16.318
I, King of the Arusians,
formally beg your forgiveness.

08:16.401 --> 08:21.949
Please have mercy on us and accept
our traditional Dance of Apology

08:22.616 --> 08:25.827
as atonement for our wrongdoings.

08:29.122 --> 08:31.667
Commence Dance of Apology!

08:31.750 --> 08:33.251
Hoorah!

08:44.638 --> 08:46.390
Please, there's no need for this.

08:46.473 --> 08:48.016
Moontow, halt!

08:48.100 --> 08:52.729
The Goddess has refused the apology.
Start the sacrificial fire.

08:52.813 --> 08:55.357
We must throw ourselves in.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.442
No! No sacrifices!

08:57.526 --> 09:00.362
So, we may proceed with the dance?

09:00.445 --> 09:02.572
That's a better alternative.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.127
Oh, my!

09:16.753 --> 09:18.797
Please, please, rise.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.135
Thank you for that, but I am not
a great being worthy of your worship.

09:23.218 --> 09:26.075
I accidentally put you all in danger.

09:26.076 --> 09:28.932
It is I who should
be apologizing to you.

09:29.933 --> 09:33.687
I am Princess Allura
and these are the Voltron Paladins.

09:33.770 --> 09:36.314
Although we originally came
from different worlds...

09:36.398 --> 09:40.152
and have very, very,
very different traditions,

09:40.235 --> 09:43.697
we wish to live alongside you as friends.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.742
But the mighty robotic angel...

09:46.825 --> 09:50.704
has it not come to destroy us
because of our immoral ways?

09:50.787 --> 09:55.959
Voltron? No. In fact, that mighty robot
is here to protect you.

09:56.334 --> 10:00.130
Let it be known that Voltron will protect
every innocent being

10:00.213 --> 10:02.257
throughout the universe!

10:11.433 --> 10:14.728
I don't usually hug strangers, but, uh...

10:14.811 --> 10:17.105
Man, you are cuddly.

10:17.189 --> 10:19.024
Thank you.

10:28.533 --> 10:31.536
This looks like the master
control board, but there's no power.

10:31.620 --> 10:32.954
All you need is power?

10:33.038 --> 10:35.832
Yeah, but one that's compatible
with Galra tech.

10:42.214 --> 10:43.507
Whoa...

10:46.676 --> 10:48.720
I can't believe you got this to work.

10:50.597 --> 10:54.017
My dad's and Matt's whereabouts
must be logged in here somewhere.

10:54.101 --> 10:55.685
Once I download this information,

10:55.769 --> 10:58.021
I'll find some way to decode it
back at the Castle.

10:58.105 --> 11:00.065
What?

11:03.819 --> 11:05.320
Oh, no.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.989
- What is it?
- Something just entered the atmosphere.

11:08.073 --> 11:11.827
I'm not sure what it is, but it's big,
it's Galra, and it's coming right for us.

11:11.910 --> 11:14.704
- We gotta go!
- Shiro, don't move!

11:14.788 --> 11:17.499
I'm only 15 percent done.
I'm not going anywhere.

11:26.925 --> 11:28.718
- Pidge, I'm sorry.
- No!

11:30.512 --> 11:32.264
Team, come in! We need backup!

11:32.347 --> 11:33.807
<i>- Hello?
- Shiro?</i>

11:33.890 --> 11:36.268
<i>- Where is everyone?
- What's going on?</i>

11:39.604 --> 11:42.148
Oh, no. We gotta get to our lions!

11:43.942 --> 11:46.152
Everyone get inside and stay down!

11:46.236 --> 11:48.029
- I'm on it!
- Huh?

11:48.864 --> 11:50.657
Not you!

11:50.740 --> 11:54.035
No! Shiro, let me go!
My father!

11:54.119 --> 11:54.995
Huh?

11:57.080 --> 11:58.039
Run!

12:22.022 --> 12:25.191
- Our lions just saved us.
- I didn't know they could do that.

12:25.275 --> 12:27.611
Huh? Um... Shiro?

12:51.176 --> 12:52.928
<i>Get in your lion!</i>

13:24.709 --> 13:26.711
Huh?

13:36.930 --> 13:39.265
Lay down some covering fire
so they can get out of there!

13:41.685 --> 13:43.269
<i>I'm on it!</i>

13:46.940 --> 13:49.609
Check this out! Battle-lion head-butt!

13:52.362 --> 13:55.490
<i>- You guys okay down there?
- Still alive for now.</i>

13:59.911 --> 14:01.538
Are the Galra behind this?

14:01.621 --> 14:03.957
I think so, but I've never
seen anything like it.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.334
So, what's the plan?
Shoot at it with everything we've got?

14:06.418 --> 14:08.420
Take out its weapon? Call it names?

14:08.503 --> 14:11.423
If we want to take this monster down,
there's only one way to do it.

14:14.718 --> 14:16.386
<i>Form Voltron!</i>

15:18.698 --> 15:22.035
<i>Remember, we are one unit,
fighting with one goal.</i>

16:01.658 --> 16:02.867
<i>Huh?</i>

16:03.827 --> 16:06.830
<i>I thought Voltron was the most
powerful weapon in the universe!</i>

16:06.913 --> 16:09.666
<i>Yeah, so how is this monster
kicking our butts?</i>

16:19.426 --> 16:22.387
Oh, no! The village!
We have to protect those people!

16:37.861 --> 16:39.320
<i>That was close!</i>

16:43.783 --> 16:46.828
We got him away from the Arusians,
but we can't take him down!

16:46.911 --> 16:49.122
I got it! I'm going to power-kick
that orb thing!

16:49.205 --> 16:51.624
<i>No! The last time
you did a kick, we fell!</i>

16:51.708 --> 16:53.293
<i>Stop living in the past!</i>

17:03.720 --> 17:05.430
Oh, no!

17:11.478 --> 17:14.731
<i>- Pidge, fire lasers now!
- Got it! Fire!</i>

17:15.815 --> 17:18.443
<i>- Oops!
- No! Lasers! Lasers!</i>

17:29.370 --> 17:32.415
Every time we focus on that orb,
we're blindsided by the monster,

17:32.499 --> 17:35.251
and every time we focus
on the monster, the orb hits us!

17:35.335 --> 17:37.128
- Then what do we do?
- Orb!

17:40.673 --> 17:45.428
Shiro, we gotta move!
Shiro, are you there? Shiro!

17:50.517 --> 17:55.188
That sound... I recognize this monster
from my time in Zarkon's prison.

17:55.271 --> 17:56.523
I know how to beat him!

18:04.864 --> 18:08.493
Listen, there's a loud sound when the orb
returns to the base of the weapon,

18:08.576 --> 18:11.371
<i>and every third time,
that orb needs to charge up.</i>

18:11.454 --> 18:14.874
That's this monster's weakest point.
That's when we strike.

18:14.958 --> 18:17.377
- Okay, so what do we do in the meantime?
- Defense!

18:20.547 --> 18:21.839
Pidge, we need that shield!

18:27.804 --> 18:29.514
That's one. Two more to go!

18:35.228 --> 18:36.771
We can't take much more!

18:40.483 --> 18:42.610
Last one! Everyone brace for impact!

18:51.244 --> 18:52.579
Now!

19:08.219 --> 19:10.388
- It didn't work!
- So, now what?

19:15.101 --> 19:17.145
When I attacked him before,
I had a sword!

19:17.228 --> 19:18.855
Orb! Orb!

19:19.939 --> 19:22.108
<i>We can't take another shot like that!</i>

19:26.404 --> 19:29.532
Wait a second, guys!
I think my lion's telling me what to do.

19:29.616 --> 19:32.785
Whatever it is, hurry up and do it!
He's about to fire his third shot!

20:13.242 --> 20:15.703
- Yeah!
- We did it!

20:15.787 --> 20:17.288
How did you do that?

20:19.999 --> 20:23.294
Whoa.
Thanks, Red.

20:28.174 --> 20:29.967
No!

20:30.051 --> 20:33.012
I'll make another, more powerful.

20:33.096 --> 20:37.225
That won't be necessary.
Sendak is still alive on Arus.

20:37.308 --> 20:40.019
I've given him instructions
for how to proceed.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.437
Can he be trusted?

20:41.521 --> 20:46.275
I trained him and he has his mission.
He fights in the name of Galra.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.696
Only success or death will stop him.

20:50.363 --> 20:54.659
Zarkon has challenged us to rise
from the mud and prove our worth.

20:54.742 --> 20:56.411
We will not let him down.

20:56.494 --> 20:58.913
Sir, how are we going to take the Castle

20:58.996 --> 21:01.958
with just the two of us
and five damaged sentries?

21:02.041 --> 21:06.254
- By exploiting our enemy's weaknesses.
- What weaknesses?

21:06.337 --> 21:11.134
The worst weakness of all:
They value the lives of others.

21:15.388 --> 21:18.891
- Good luck out there.
- Thank you all for everything.

21:18.975 --> 21:22.270
We never dreamed
we'd see our families again.

21:22.353 --> 21:26.482
But you gave us hope.
You gave the universe hope.

21:33.865 --> 21:35.491
- Pidge, there you are.
- Hmm?

21:36.367 --> 21:39.245
Why would you hurt my brother?
You were friends.

21:40.037 --> 21:42.874
- I did it to save him.
- What?

21:42.957 --> 21:46.461
My memory of the event came back
when we were fighting the monster.

21:46.544 --> 21:49.547
<i>Your dad was being sent off
with the weaker prisoners to a work camp.</i>

21:49.630 --> 21:52.967
<i>Meanwhile, Matt and I were forced
to fight in the gladiator arena.</i>

21:53.050 --> 21:57.472
<i>Matt was going to fight first,
but he was scared. We all were.</i>

21:57.555 --> 22:00.433
I'm not going to make it.
I'll never see my family again!

22:00.516 --> 22:02.226
You can do this.

22:10.651 --> 22:12.111
This is my fight!

22:14.614 --> 22:15.948
I want blood!

22:17.909 --> 22:20.369
Take care of your father.

22:23.581 --> 22:28.711
You saved him? You attacked him
so they would choose you instead.

22:30.755 --> 22:34.926
I'm so sorry I doubted you!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

22:36.302 --> 22:39.555
I can tell you really miss them.
I know they miss you, too.

22:39.639 --> 22:41.807
Your brother and father
would be proud of you, Katie.

22:43.392 --> 22:47.230
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
