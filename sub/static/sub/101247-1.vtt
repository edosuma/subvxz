WEBVTT

01:54.691 --> 01:55.958
Alexis?

01:57.660 --> 01:59.729
Are you okay?

01:59.762 --> 02:02.965
Are the kids okay?

02:02.999 --> 02:05.367
Yeah.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.470
They're fine.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.739
They're fine.

02:16.979 --> 02:19.582
That was so real.

02:19.615 --> 02:23.318
They ran away.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.488
And I could hear the kids
yelling, like, far away

02:26.521 --> 02:30.258
and I could see
their footprints on the sand.

02:30.292 --> 02:31.728
I followed them.

02:31.761 --> 02:32.995
But I couldn't go in the water.

02:33.029 --> 02:34.997
It was like it was glass.

02:35.031 --> 02:36.498
And I'm hitting the water,

02:36.531 --> 02:38.901
but it's like a window
at an aquarium.

02:38.935 --> 02:42.537
And I could see the kids
looking at me and I'm just...

02:42.571 --> 02:44.339
It's just a dream.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.842
It's not real.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.277
No, David.

02:49.311 --> 02:50.813
It was so real.

02:54.784 --> 02:56.418
I have to clean the kitchen.

02:56.451 --> 02:58.320
What? Now?

02:58.353 --> 02:59.655
Yes.

02:59.689 --> 03:01.824
Favvy's coming. She judges.

03:01.858 --> 03:04.493
Dude, fuck Favvy.

03:04.526 --> 03:07.395
- Don't curse my sister.
- Sorry.

03:07.429 --> 03:11.333
Daddy, my tooth is wiggly!
Is it ready to come out?

03:11.366 --> 03:12.802
Yeah, here, let me see it.

03:12.835 --> 03:14.670
- Let me see, let me see.
- You're going to pull it out.

03:14.704 --> 03:17.673
No I won't.
I just want to see it, okay?

03:17.707 --> 03:18.975
Open your mouth.

03:19.008 --> 03:20.475
Go "ah."

03:20.509 --> 03:23.045
Open.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.747
- This one, right?
- Mm-hmm.

03:24.781 --> 03:27.049
Oh, wow.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.417
It is loose.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.520
- Does it hurt you?
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.553 --> 03:32.889
Okay, honey.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.056
Daddy!

03:34.090 --> 03:35.758
Hey, look, if you swallow it

03:35.792 --> 03:37.960
you can't get all the money
from the Tooth Fairy.

03:37.994 --> 03:39.427
Can I have $10?

03:39.461 --> 03:40.997
What? For a tooth?

03:41.030 --> 03:44.634
Christ, I thank you for this
bounty and your blessings.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.569
I will serve as an instrument
of your will this day.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.805
Please send
your guardian angels

03:48.838 --> 03:51.040
to watch over
my wife and children,

03:51.073 --> 03:54.543
her mom, Janet, and sister,
Faviola, and Jazmin.

03:54.577 --> 03:59.682
Almighty God who lives and rules
the world without end, amen.

03:59.715 --> 04:01.416
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.419
Okay, the big date...
what happened?

04:04.452 --> 04:07.123
So, he takes me to this
really nice steak place.

04:07.156 --> 04:08.591
Is the dude on Tinder?

04:08.624 --> 04:10.559
Did he super like you?

04:10.593 --> 04:12.494
I am on Tinder, David,

04:12.527 --> 04:14.764
because not everyone
won the marriage lottery.

04:16.065 --> 04:17.632
I can't believe
you're on Tinder.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.869
- Alexis.
- David, stop.

04:21.870 --> 04:26.075
Hey, what's up, sis?

04:26.108 --> 04:27.844
All this food
for Jazmin's <i>quince?</i>

04:29.946 --> 04:32.514
What? I'm hungry,
and it smells good.

04:32.547 --> 04:34.851
<i>Mija,</i> you are so pretty.

04:34.884 --> 04:36.118
Hey, can I do her makeup?

04:36.152 --> 04:38.855
- No.
- We have someone.

04:38.888 --> 04:40.122
You want to help us?

04:40.156 --> 04:41.556
We have to start
shredding the pork.

04:41.591 --> 04:43.391
Mommy, my eyes burn.

04:43.425 --> 04:44.694
Baby, fix the alarm.

04:44.727 --> 04:45.995
Fix it?
It's doing what it does.

04:46.028 --> 04:47.529
It's all smoky in here.
Open up a window.

04:47.562 --> 04:50.532
- Oh, <i>mami.</i>
- Take the battery out.

04:50.565 --> 04:54.469
Chill with the chilis
for one second.

04:56.205 --> 04:57.773
- I got to go, okay?
- Take Dylan to his game.

04:57.807 --> 04:59.075
I can't. I'm late.

04:59.108 --> 05:01.077
Listen, I'll take him.
I'll take Dylan, okay?

05:01.110 --> 05:02.712
I have to go
to the store anyway.

05:02.745 --> 05:04.046
Thank you, Favvy.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.214
Hey, we have to
get your dress.

05:05.248 --> 05:07.482
Hey, when do you
get the dress? What color is it?

05:07.515 --> 05:08.784
Favvy, I'm going to pay
for the dress.

05:08.818 --> 05:10.418
No, no, no, no.
No, seriously.

05:10.452 --> 05:11.821
It's done.
I'm going to cover the dress.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.123
Jazmin, can you help me
cut the tomatoes, please?

05:14.156 --> 05:15.992
- Take of your brother, okay?
- Okay.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.559
- Bye, Dad.

a couple of fucking monsters.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.692
That little dude is used to

14:42.725 --> 14:44.259
dealing with
little fucking homeys,

14:44.293 --> 14:46.128
and now he's talking
to the fucking power.

14:46.161 --> 14:47.329
Just being cautious, <i>Tío.</i>

14:47.362 --> 14:48.530
Oh, yeah?
I'll be cautious, okay?

14:48.564 --> 14:50.065
You just do your fucking job.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.601
Come on, <i>Tío.</i>

14:51.634 --> 14:53.603
The cops blasted the other dude
I was fucking with.

15:21.631 --> 15:24.566
Hey, for Jazmin's <i>quince,</i>
take this, eh?

15:24.601 --> 15:27.369
Put that down for the food.
Alexis's mom's all over it.

15:27.402 --> 15:30.272
- They've been cooking all day.
- Well, take it for the beer.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.273
Alright, the beer.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.775
Come here. Give me a hug.

15:35.277 --> 15:36.746
Thank you.
I love you, alright?

15:36.779 --> 15:39.716
- Be careful.
- I love you, <i>Tío.</i>

15:42.417 --> 15:44.453
- See you at the party.
- See you at the party.

15:51.861 --> 15:54.530
Hey, how come I didn't get
an invite to the <i>quince?</i>

15:54.563 --> 15:56.265
You can come through.

15:56.298 --> 15:57.767
That's not an invitation.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.836
That's you saying come through
'cause I asked you.

15:59.869 --> 16:02.437
A real invitation is like a nice
card with lace edges and shit.

16:02.471 --> 16:04.172
Well, don't fucking
come through then.

16:04.206 --> 16:06.375
I want to come through.
I'd like to support your family.

16:06.408 --> 16:09.177
I know Alexis gets uncomfortable
around me so I stay away.

16:09.211 --> 16:11.848
If you got beef with Alexis,
go have coffee with her.

16:11.881 --> 16:13.448
You got her number, homey.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.417
Coffee, yeah, yeah.
I'll call her up.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.853
You really wanted
a printed invitation?

16:16.886 --> 16:18.420
Yes.

16:18.453 --> 16:20.255
They're like 20 bucks each.

16:20.723 --> 16:22.391
I thought it would
be a nice souvenir.

16:22.424 --> 16:23.292
Jazmin's a nice girl.

16:23.325 --> 16:26.629
Yo, how is it you
don't have no kids, huh?

16:26.663 --> 16:29.231
Condoms, IUDs,
birth control pills,

16:29.264 --> 16:31.433
morning after pills,
plan A, plan B, plan C.

16:31.466 --> 16:33.168
- There's a lot of options, boy.
- You're going to hell, man.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.604
Yeah,
but I'm at peace with that.

16:34.637 --> 16:36.405
I'm not going to argue
about Jesus with you.

16:39.141 --> 16:40.743
You ever meditate?

16:40.777 --> 16:42.612
No.

16:42.645 --> 16:43.880
No?

16:43.913 --> 16:45.648
No,
I don't fuck with that.

16:45.682 --> 16:47.617
That shit's satanic.

16:47.650 --> 16:50.720
Okay, so some people
say yoga's satanic.

16:50.753 --> 16:54.289
Some people. They do.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.457
I'm doing that mindfulness shit.

16:55.490 --> 16:57.326
The fuck is that?

16:57.359 --> 16:58.661
So first thing in the morning...

16:58.695 --> 17:00.630
- Yeah?
- Clear my head of noise.

17:00.663 --> 17:04.532
Boom.
Focus on my breathing.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.535
Observe my thoughts.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.570
Then I lean into my day.

17:09.606 --> 17:11.306
Are we killing anybody today?

17:11.339 --> 17:13.108
I've got fucking nice shoes on.

17:19.616 --> 17:22.184
Guppi.

17:36.899 --> 17:40.502
That's good work.
That's clean lines.

17:42.237 --> 17:43.472
You mind if I do that?

17:43.505 --> 17:45.207
It's always been
a dream of mine, huh?

17:51.748 --> 17:53.515
One thing.

17:53.548 --> 17:55.685
You got what we came for?

17:55.718 --> 17:57.386
- Hmm?
- Bag.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.359
Looks good.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.461
Creeper, stop.

18:06.495 --> 18:08.563
Mm.

18:08.598 --> 18:10.399
How was the funeral?

18:10.432 --> 18:12.602
You know, kind of sad.

18:12.635 --> 18:15.638
There's family, so laying kids
and shit out there.

18:15.672 --> 18:19.742
Sorry about your boy, homey.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.778
I am.

18:21.811 --> 18:25.581
Dude had a family
but he also knew the <i>reglas.</i>

18:25.615 --> 18:29.852
He made his decision.
We made ours.

18:29.886 --> 18:33.589
I'mma take that green light
off of you, okay?

18:33.623 --> 18:37.259
You show your face,
you walk the block,

18:37.292 --> 18:40.797
you conduct
your business in safety.

18:40.830 --> 18:42.531
Thank you.

18:48.004 --> 18:49.839
Motherfucker
got himself killed

18:49.872 --> 18:51.774
and had four fucking kids.

18:51.808 --> 18:54.577
Why would you fuck with that?

18:54.610 --> 18:57.412
You got the money,
pay the fucking money.

18:57.446 --> 18:58.981
It's greed. These guys
are fucking criminals.

18:59.015 --> 19:00.750
It's in their nature
to cheat the system.

19:00.783 --> 19:03.251
It's nothing new.

19:03.285 --> 19:04.654
It could happen to us.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.623
- No.
- A short count,

19:07.657 --> 19:09.458
or we end up on the wrong side
of the politics,

19:09.491 --> 19:11.526
- I mean, we'll get smoked.
- Hey.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.662
You're connected as fuck.

19:12.695 --> 19:15.297
No one is touching you never.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.333
Hey, homey, that shit
smells like ass.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.302
This? This is fish.
It's going to have an odor.

19:20.335 --> 19:21.838
Like summertime dead body nasty.

19:21.871 --> 19:23.005
Well, I'm not going
to apologize for it.

19:23.039 --> 19:24.439
Maybe you're too sensitive.

19:24.473 --> 19:25.540
I've got way more energy
on this diet.

19:25.574 --> 19:27.342
That's not a good thing.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.276
You want this last piece?

19:28.310 --> 19:29.544
No, I don't want it.

19:29.579 --> 19:31.881
Throw that shit
out the fucking window.

19:31.914 --> 19:33.315
Hey, what's up big dog?

19:33.348 --> 19:36.518
It's been a minute.
You good?

19:36.551 --> 19:37.820
Okay, let me get into it, homey.

19:37.854 --> 19:41.389
Don't trip. I got you.

19:41.423 --> 19:42.658
Side mission, dawg.

19:52.602 --> 19:54.402
What's up, holmes?

19:58.708 --> 19:59.809
Wake up.

20:18.995 --> 20:21.631
He fucked the homey's lady.

20:21.664 --> 20:24.399
The <i>vato</i> dropped all his cash
on an engagement ring

20:24.432 --> 20:26.636
and then finds this <i>puto's</i>
number on her fucking phone

20:26.669 --> 20:28.370
sexting the fuck out of her.

20:28.403 --> 20:30.372
Come on.

20:30.405 --> 20:33.542
So let's squash this
before shit pops off.

20:33.576 --> 20:34.610
What do you want me to do?

20:34.644 --> 20:37.880
Cut him loose and clean him up.

20:37.914 --> 20:39.882
You guys can't do this shit.

20:39.916 --> 20:42.350
These ain't Vietnam, homey.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.787
We got business with the Bloods.

20:44.821 --> 20:46.889
The homeboy needs
to check his lady,

20:46.923 --> 20:50.927
not the motherfuckers
piping her, okay?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.361
Alright, David.

20:53.395 --> 20:54.630
My bad.

20:56.632 --> 20:59.035
Get the motherfucker in here.

20:59.068 --> 21:01.536
Hey, Pete.

21:01.570 --> 21:03.438
Four-five this motherfucker.

21:08.978 --> 21:10.345
Motherfucker.

21:20.923 --> 21:22.592
Look, they got the homey.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.794
What the fuck, hey?

21:31.033 --> 21:33.002
Hold up, hold up.
What's up with it?

21:33.035 --> 21:35.705
Hold the fuck up, Blood.

21:35.738 --> 21:37.039
What the fuck, man?

21:37.073 --> 21:38.608
No disrespect.

21:38.641 --> 21:40.810
It wasn't business,
and it wasn't racial.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.045
Just some young guns
tripping personal.

21:43.079 --> 21:45.047
Checked those responsible.

21:45.081 --> 21:46.949
Got your boy before
it got crazy, man.

21:50.219 --> 21:52.889
I'mma keep it G with you, David.

21:52.922 --> 21:54.991
And I know you've got
your chess pieces

21:55.024 --> 21:56.759
and for sure I've got mine.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.595
But I want all this
shit to die today.

21:59.629 --> 22:04.000
I want to walk away clean
and focus on the business,

22:04.033 --> 22:06.903
you know what I'm saying?

22:06.936 --> 22:10.840
You're a candle in the darkness.

22:10.873 --> 22:12.909
Keep that shit real with you.

22:36.531 --> 22:38.500
You didn't have to do that.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.903
Yeah, I did.

22:40.937 --> 22:45.007
Bone helped me solve some
problems back in the day, so...

22:45.041 --> 22:47.542
60, right?

22:50.112 --> 22:52.848
There you go.
It's all there.

22:52.882 --> 22:54.116
Show it to me.

22:56.886 --> 22:58.587
Okay.

23:02.091 --> 23:06.162
It's been kind of slow
right now, you know?

23:06.195 --> 23:08.931
A lot of college kids
out of town.

23:08.965 --> 23:11.067
Got that hook up though on that
good molly if you need it.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.868
Got two homeys out of
San Francisco.

23:12.902 --> 23:14.770
They slinging their shit left
and right to all them

23:14.804 --> 23:16.605
Silicon Valley motherfuckers.

23:16.639 --> 23:18.774
Everybody wants,
like, acid and LSD.

23:18.808 --> 23:20.977
It's crazy up there.

23:21.010 --> 23:22.278
They microdose now.

23:22.311 --> 23:24.046
They take these small doses
every day.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.816
It's supposed to make them
more creative or some shit.

23:26.849 --> 23:30.186
Took acid every day for a month
straight but big fucking doses.

23:30.219 --> 23:33.055
Big. Made me feel like
I was metal wire

23:33.089 --> 23:35.691
and fucking alien shit
flying all over the place.

23:35.725 --> 23:37.860
- Damn, homey.
- Fucking weird, fool.

23:37.893 --> 23:41.197
Hey, I don't want
to break it up or nothing

23:41.230 --> 23:43.766
but if you guys know
of a good chemist, let me know.

23:43.799 --> 23:45.768
Adderall too,
you know what I mean?

23:45.801 --> 23:47.870
Yeah, it's like popcorn
to these college kids.

23:47.903 --> 23:49.872
Trust me when I tell you.

23:49.905 --> 23:51.140
I'll ask around.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.846
The Paisas, man, they're giving
us great competition, you know?

23:56.879 --> 23:58.114
They don't pay no taxes

23:58.147 --> 24:00.182
so their...
their prices are better.

24:00.216 --> 24:02.151
You can't make no money
'cause a border brother's

24:02.184 --> 24:04.153
got better prices?

24:06.188 --> 24:07.990
Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

24:08.024 --> 24:10.558
I understand.

24:12.695 --> 24:15.831
Yellow is one of
my favorite colors.

24:15.865 --> 24:18.834
45 minutes.
Where on earth is David?

24:20.336 --> 24:21.771
Hey, you good?

24:21.804 --> 24:23.806
The dress
isn't happening today.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.809
The Mexican Kardashians
got here before us.

24:26.842 --> 24:29.345
- And they're closed tomorrow.
- Are we going to get my dress?

24:29.378 --> 24:31.814
Yes, we are going to get
your dress, <i>mami,</i> don't worry.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.315
Babe,
I really need your help.

24:33.349 --> 24:34.750
Okay.

24:34.784 --> 24:36.185
We can't let this
ruin her quince.

24:36.218 --> 24:38.754
Let me get into it.
Alright, give me 15 minutes.

24:38.788 --> 24:40.956
Thank you, baby.

24:40.990 --> 24:42.925
Fuck.

24:50.399 --> 24:51.967
- <i>Vamonos.</i>
- We got here first.

24:52.001 --> 24:53.669
It's my wedding dress.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.004
- Bye.
- <i>Vamonos.</i>

24:55.037 --> 24:58.641
I've been waiting
the whole week for this.

24:58.674 --> 25:00.342
Bye.

25:00.376 --> 25:02.344
- Okay, let's get this done.
- Where is the dress?

25:02.378 --> 25:05.014
- Definitely not that one.
- Let's see.

25:08.350 --> 25:11.287
You've got a connect out of
San Diego Chicano Park

25:11.320 --> 25:16.625
who's given you 30 pounds
of meth a week since April.

25:16.659 --> 25:21.030
So you owe back taxes
on 120 pounds.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.267
You got 50 grand?

25:29.205 --> 25:32.374
Alright, let's call it a day.

25:32.408 --> 25:34.743
I've got to get back
to the ranch, homey.

25:40.149 --> 25:41.350
Daddy!

25:41.383 --> 25:45.154
<i>Tía</i> Favvy took us to In-N-Out.

25:45.187 --> 25:46.889
Where's Alexis?

25:46.922 --> 25:48.757
In the room napping.

25:48.791 --> 25:52.027
How'd the dress work out?

25:52.061 --> 25:54.196
Thank you.

25:54.230 --> 25:57.366
No, for real. It's so cute.

25:57.399 --> 25:59.368
Jazmin is so happy.

26:17.987 --> 26:20.689
- Babe?
- Hmm?

26:20.723 --> 26:23.292
What's up?

26:23.325 --> 26:26.729
The count's 20 grand short.

26:26.762 --> 26:28.731
Are you sure?

26:35.371 --> 26:37.139
Shit, I mean, I don't count it.

26:37.173 --> 26:39.909
It's Big Loma's gang.

26:39.942 --> 26:42.111
Motherfucker.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.113
It's a new guy, and he didn't
know how much they owed

26:44.146 --> 26:45.848
and I forgot to check the kite
from the little girl

26:45.881 --> 26:47.349
and I was running late
to hit all the neighborhoods.

26:47.383 --> 26:48.184
It's okay, it's okay.

26:48.217 --> 26:50.920
Calm down, baby.

26:50.953 --> 26:52.855
Look, I have a little float
that I keep week to week

26:52.888 --> 26:54.323
for this kind of thing.

26:54.356 --> 26:57.993
But we can't afford to cover
other people's mistakes.

27:02.031 --> 27:03.732
Is that Wizard?

27:06.535 --> 27:08.337
- Yes?
- Listen up.

27:08.370 --> 27:11.907
Collection needs to go
smooth this month.

27:11.941 --> 27:14.109
I've got something
big happening.

27:14.143 --> 27:15.778
No fuck ups.

27:15.811 --> 27:17.146
I understand.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.982
Put the fool on.
I know he's in there.

27:20.015 --> 27:23.452
Yeah, just a second.

27:23.485 --> 27:26.155
He wants to talk to you.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.501
Yes, sir.

27:44.940 --> 27:46.542
Hello.

27:58.354 --> 27:59.855
Just heard him laughing
and then he hung up.

27:59.888 --> 28:01.257
What did he say?

28:01.290 --> 28:03.292
He said that there's a lot
going on this week

28:03.325 --> 28:07.329
and he needs this week's
taxes to go smoothly.

28:07.363 --> 28:08.897
No mistakes.

28:08.931 --> 28:10.466
Is he fucking listening to us?

28:10.499 --> 28:12.434
Is this fucking place bugged?

28:12.468 --> 28:14.503
Calm down, calm down.
Calm down, baby.

28:14.536 --> 28:16.138
Calm down, okay?

28:16.171 --> 28:17.840
Go relax.

28:17.873 --> 28:20.509
Go have a beer.
Go play with the kids.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.945
Then you're going
to go back out, okay?

28:22.978 --> 28:25.848
Finish your paper route
so I can package all of this up

28:25.881 --> 28:28.550
and get it out of our house,
okay?

28:28.585 --> 28:30.486
Okay.

28:43.966 --> 28:46.035
Okay.

28:55.878 --> 28:58.847
You owe me
20 fucking grand, homey.

28:58.881 --> 29:01.383
I gave you basic
fucking instructions.

29:01.417 --> 29:04.053
He'll splatter your brains
all over your old lady.

29:04.086 --> 29:06.388
You don't want that.
I don't want that.

29:06.422 --> 29:08.324
And she sure as shit
don't want that.

29:08.357 --> 29:10.359
I do. I want that.

29:10.392 --> 29:12.595
Hey, this guy, he wants that.

29:12.629 --> 29:14.330
I want that, Victor.

29:16.532 --> 29:19.401
I'm asking you, homey,
why would you do that?

29:21.937 --> 29:23.439
- Open your mouth.
- Okay!

29:23.472 --> 29:25.274
I'll take your bitch
as collateral

29:25.307 --> 29:27.443
and put her in my fucking truck
until you make it right, homey.

29:27.476 --> 29:28.344
- I'll make it right.
- Huh?

29:28.377 --> 29:29.878
- I'll make it right.
- I can't hear you.

29:29.912 --> 29:31.046
What the fuck are you saying,
homey?

29:31.080 --> 29:32.514
I'll make it right.

29:32.548 --> 29:35.250
- What?
- I'll make it right.

29:35.284 --> 29:37.019
In the freezer,
there's a TV dinner.

29:37.052 --> 29:39.589
What kind of fucking TV dinner?
I'm on a special diet.

29:44.426 --> 29:46.995
The money's in the freezer.

29:47.029 --> 29:48.530
You were hiding
the money, Victor.

29:48.564 --> 29:50.999
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

29:51.033 --> 29:55.237
Why did you think
to fucking do that, Victor?

29:55.270 --> 29:57.406
My little girl's got leukemia

29:57.439 --> 29:59.041
and we ain't got no insurance.

29:59.074 --> 30:01.678
Victor, you think
I'm stupid, homey?

30:01.711 --> 30:04.546
This motherfucker. Try again.

30:04.581 --> 30:06.248
Why did you hide
the fucking money, Victor?

30:06.281 --> 30:08.984
My little girl's got
leukemia, man. I'm sorry.

30:09.017 --> 30:11.954
Prove it.

30:11.987 --> 30:14.256
This morning in
the children's hospital.

30:14.289 --> 30:15.991
He's lying, David.

30:18.427 --> 30:20.062
What's her name?

30:20.095 --> 30:21.263
Isabella.

30:21.296 --> 30:22.965
- How old is she?
- Five.

30:22.998 --> 30:24.466
- Where was she born?
- Montebello.

30:26.468 --> 30:29.471
What am I doing?
David, what am I doing?

30:29.505 --> 30:32.040
- Hm?
- Hold up.

30:32.074 --> 30:34.476
Fuck.

30:34.510 --> 30:35.944
Don't, David.

30:45.755 --> 30:47.356
Let's go, Creeper.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.352
That's your fucking
problem, right there.

31:17.386 --> 31:18.621
You can't compartmentalize.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.289
You're taxing 43
different street gangs.

31:20.322 --> 31:22.157
That's thousands of dudes
in the most violent,

31:22.191 --> 31:23.593
fucked-up subculture
in Los Angeles,

31:23.626 --> 31:25.427
and you want to play
the fucking pope out here.

31:25.461 --> 31:29.097
You need to know when to shut
the fuck up Creeper.

31:29.131 --> 31:30.667
Alexis is going to
fuck your shit up.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.001
Yeah, I already fucking know,
homey, I already know.

31:33.035 --> 31:34.604
I already know, alright?

31:34.637 --> 31:36.438
Don't got to fucking remind me.

31:40.108 --> 31:42.044
What the fuck?

31:42.077 --> 31:43.412
What?

31:43.445 --> 31:45.682
Hey, we got to go see Venom
from Hillside.

31:45.715 --> 31:47.483
200 fucking grand.

31:47.516 --> 31:49.184
Hillside Trece 200 grand?

31:49.218 --> 31:51.588
- Yeah.
- Wow.

31:51.621 --> 31:53.422
They must have had
a serious fucking come-up

31:53.455 --> 31:54.556
over there, huh?

31:54.591 --> 31:56.091
Let's take their money.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.193
I already fucked
every bitch in their hood.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.153
David?

32:25.187 --> 32:27.456
Yeah.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.658
Alright.

32:48.678 --> 32:50.178
Have a seat.

32:50.212 --> 32:52.582
Drink some pista, holmes.

32:52.615 --> 32:54.717
You know I ain't here
to socialize.

32:56.653 --> 32:59.187
Your uncle used to do your job.

32:59.221 --> 33:01.423
Him and that fat fuck Spanky.

33:01.456 --> 33:03.392
Went to all the different gangs
in the neighborhood

33:03.425 --> 33:05.294
making collects.

33:05.327 --> 33:08.497
You're only here
because of your fucking daddy.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.700
I earned my way to the top.

33:10.733 --> 33:13.502
I'm here to collect
your fucking taxes.

33:13.535 --> 33:16.639
So put your fucking money
on the table,

33:16.673 --> 33:20.577
stop opening your fucking mouth,
and do as you're fucking told.

33:20.610 --> 33:22.745
I got the money.
That ain't the problem.

33:22.779 --> 33:24.781
Put the fucking fetty
on the table right now

33:24.814 --> 33:27.717
or it's your last supper,
I promise you, my boy.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.451
Right now.

33:39.194 --> 33:40.697
This isn't yours.

33:49.906 --> 33:51.373
Who the fuck are you?

33:51.406 --> 33:54.176
I'm the future and you the past.

33:54.209 --> 33:57.780
So Venom, he work for me now.

33:57.814 --> 34:01.450
And all this right here,
it's my money.

34:03.485 --> 34:05.287
Who the fuck are you?

34:20.268 --> 34:21.904
Okay, Conejo.

35:21.998 --> 35:23.766
Because it's not a mistake.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.400
It's a motherfucking earthquake,

35:25.434 --> 35:27.235
and everything
get knocked down.

35:55.430 --> 35:57.466
Let's go, Creeper.

36:08.443 --> 36:11.047
I got a .380 on each ankle,
.38 on my right, .25 on my left,

36:11.080 --> 36:12.782
chopper in the trunk,
Glock in my belt, fuck.

36:12.815 --> 36:15.317
Don't get too fucking
excited, homey.

36:15.350 --> 36:17.587
It's just a lot
of fucking cash, you feel me?

36:17.620 --> 36:19.789
You know my uncle
whacked Venom's dad.

36:20.455 --> 36:21.858
And he wants to cut
your heart out for sure.

36:21.891 --> 36:24.761
You say the word,
I'll push that bitch's wig back.

36:24.794 --> 36:27.697
- I don't want that, Creeper.
- I'm on it.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.001
Who is he?

36:32.034 --> 36:33.636
Who's Conejo?

36:33.669 --> 36:35.938
It's a confident move,
taking Wizard's money.

36:35.972 --> 36:38.573
He's got to be
connected as fuck.

36:38.608 --> 36:39.842
I know who he is.

36:39.876 --> 36:41.744
Some fucking West Side
heavy hitter.

36:41.778 --> 36:43.378
Remember he kidnapped people?

36:43.411 --> 36:45.380
Fucking cut them up,
burned that dude one time,

36:45.413 --> 36:47.349
sent a video tape to his mom.

36:47.382 --> 36:49.886
Fucking straight-up
street terrorist.

36:49.919 --> 36:51.888
But Wizard was going
to have him taken out.

36:51.921 --> 36:53.488
So he bounced down to Mexico.

36:53.522 --> 36:55.958
He's been MIA for like 10 years.

36:55.992 --> 36:58.661
Conejo, fuck that <i>puto,</i> hey?
Fuck him.

36:58.694 --> 37:01.530
I'll skin that motherfucker.
You should have let me have him.

37:01.563 --> 37:04.332
I need to put it to a vote.
I need 24 hours.

37:04.366 --> 37:07.837
It's got to go down
the right way.

37:07.870 --> 37:09.772
You're scared of him.

37:09.806 --> 37:11.874
The fuck did you say?

37:11.908 --> 37:13.709
If you weren't my nephew,
I'd stick your fucking face

37:13.743 --> 37:15.477
in that fire
until you stopped moving.

37:15.510 --> 37:17.013
Alright, holmes?

37:17.046 --> 37:19.381
I ain't scared of any bitch-made
motherfucker, alright?

37:19.414 --> 37:23.485
Hey, and you don't leave till
I fucking tell you to leave.

37:23.518 --> 37:25.087
Sit your fucking ass down.

37:32.527 --> 37:35.064
You're going to mind
somebody, huh?

37:35.097 --> 37:37.633
You're my nephew and I love you
and you're bad, David,

37:37.667 --> 37:40.837
but you ain't fucking
that bad, alright?

37:40.870 --> 37:42.571
Now bounce.

37:58.154 --> 38:00.690
Marisol, give me a plate.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.514
Alexis.

38:26.548 --> 38:27.850
Alexis.

38:35.591 --> 38:39.929
What did you see in me
when we met?

38:39.962 --> 38:41.631
I told you this
a thousand times.

38:41.664 --> 38:44.867
No. There's the story you tell
everyone again and again

38:44.901 --> 38:46.802
because you like telling it.

38:46.836 --> 38:49.071
And people like hearing it.

38:49.105 --> 38:53.576
And then there's the truth.
I want that. The truth.

38:57.113 --> 39:02.118
Okay.
You remember when we met?

39:02.151 --> 39:04.620
The King Taco in South Central?

39:04.654 --> 39:07.790
I'll never forget.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.091
You were acting all stupid

39:09.125 --> 39:11.193
gang banging with your cousins
back then.

39:11.227 --> 39:15.231
Yeah, whatever. We were kids.

39:15.264 --> 39:17.667
That wasn't the first time
I saw you.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.802
What do you mean?

39:19.835 --> 39:21.904
See, a couple of weeks
before you met me

39:21.938 --> 39:24.607
my dad got really,
really drunk.

39:24.640 --> 39:28.510
I hear all this noise,
and I come out of my room,

39:28.543 --> 39:31.847
and my dad is beating
my mom with a chair.

39:45.761 --> 39:48.698
He beat my mom
until the chair broke.

39:48.731 --> 39:53.903
And my mom is bleeding
and crying and he looks at me,

39:53.936 --> 39:58.240
and he starts walking towards me
and I'm thinking, "I'm dead."

40:00.977 --> 40:04.512
He just walked right past me.
Didn't say anything.

40:04.546 --> 40:09.251
Just walked into his room
and slept for like two days.

40:12.588 --> 40:14.056
So I heard about you,

40:14.090 --> 40:17.059
and you were this big bad
gangster who killed people.

40:17.093 --> 40:18.728
So here I am,

40:18.761 --> 40:20.830
some Mexican-American princess,

40:20.863 --> 40:25.668
I go down to the hood,
figured out where you hung out.

40:25.701 --> 40:29.038
I was going to get you
to fall in love with me

40:29.071 --> 40:31.140
and get you to kill my dad.

40:34.343 --> 40:37.913
Half the plan worked.

40:37.947 --> 40:40.016
Thank God.

40:40.049 --> 40:41.717
He stopped drinking.

40:49.358 --> 40:52.194
David, what's wrong?

40:52.228 --> 40:54.864
People always want
something from me.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.136
You didn't want nothing from me.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.843
That's what I thought.

41:10.913 --> 41:12.581
I love you.

41:52.354 --> 41:53.956
There you are.
Take it from him.

41:53.989 --> 41:55.925
Now reverse it.
Ooba, ooba towards me.

41:55.958 --> 41:58.727
That's established properly.

41:58.761 --> 42:00.062
Armbar, take it, take it.

42:00.096 --> 42:02.698
Merry Christmas.

42:02.731 --> 42:05.668
Outstanding.

42:05.701 --> 42:07.269
- Alright.
- Good job, man.

42:07.303 --> 42:09.004
Okay, go.
Attack, attack, attack.

42:09.038 --> 42:11.874
Tuck your chin.

42:11.907 --> 42:13.742
Give him the ribs,
punch his ribs.

42:13.776 --> 42:15.978
Slow down, technique first.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.746
Take your time. Don't rush it.

42:17.780 --> 42:20.282
Come on, David.
Handle it, handle it.

42:20.316 --> 42:24.653
Good. Good, good, good.
That's it. Good.

42:24.687 --> 42:27.890
Wake up and smell the roses,
not your own blood.

42:27.923 --> 42:30.259
- Make sense?
- Yeah.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.101
You got a drink for us?

42:39.135 --> 42:40.136
Thank you. That's it there.

42:40.169 --> 42:41.303
That's it. That'll work there.

42:41.337 --> 42:42.304
Thank you.

42:52.214 --> 42:54.717
- Gentlemen, how are you?
- Hi, Tío.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.253
Jazmin, happy birthday.

43:07.897 --> 43:09.431
Honey.

43:11.467 --> 43:13.769
David, you know
it's a party, right?

43:13.802 --> 43:15.871
Take your shot, come on.

43:15.905 --> 43:18.040
Come on. You've been
babysitting all night.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.808
Come on, David.

43:19.842 --> 43:21.744
- Fuck him.
- Alright, fuck it, whatever.

43:25.347 --> 43:28.717
Hey, what's up, Johnny Cash?

43:28.751 --> 43:30.186
What? You're trying to be
all cool over there

43:30.219 --> 43:32.121
to impress your little
lady friend and shit?

43:32.154 --> 43:33.856
Come take a shot with us.

43:33.889 --> 43:35.824
Come on.
This is some bomb-ass tequila.

43:35.858 --> 43:37.459
Hey don't get him
fucking drunk, dude.

43:37.493 --> 43:40.429
Just one shot. One.

43:40.462 --> 43:42.498
Hey, Creeper, I've seen
your ass drunk, fool.

43:42.531 --> 43:44.500
You cry like a little bitch
and shit.

43:44.533 --> 43:46.502
I've been nothing
but a gentleman to you.

43:46.535 --> 43:48.370
How many fucking favors
have I done for you?

43:48.404 --> 43:50.506
- How many? A lot, a lot.
- Oh, yeah, tons of favors.

43:50.539 --> 43:52.041
Yeah, hold on,
let me count them.

43:52.074 --> 43:53.309
How about that time you gave me

43:53.342 --> 43:55.211
like three different STDs
and shit.

43:55.244 --> 43:56.478
Are you fucking kidding?

43:56.512 --> 43:58.781
Dude, did you fuck him
without a condom?

43:58.814 --> 44:01.951
- You're fucking nasty.
- She's kidding. She's fucking...

44:01.984 --> 44:04.119
I have a bunch of condoms.
You're going to need them.

44:04.153 --> 44:05.888
I tell you what, you go out
to the parking lot

44:05.921 --> 44:07.256
and your car's on fire,
now you know why.

44:07.289 --> 44:08.958
Oh, now I know why
my car's on fire.

44:08.991 --> 44:11.894
Hey, Creeper, I Ubered here.

44:15.998 --> 44:17.967
Hold that shit, though.
Pass that shit out.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.969
Hey, hey, no, no.
You're not fucking smoking weed

44:20.002 --> 44:22.871
in my backyard
with Alexis right here.

44:22.905 --> 44:25.407
- No.
- Dude, come on.

44:25.441 --> 44:27.109
She used to be cool as fuck.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.314
I know what it is.

44:35.184 --> 44:37.119
You talked to Dad?

44:37.152 --> 44:38.220
No.

44:38.254 --> 44:40.956
No? Since when no?

44:40.990 --> 44:43.559
Just no. Okay?

44:43.593 --> 44:44.994
He don't want to talk to me.

44:45.027 --> 44:48.297
Think he cares
what I have to say?

44:48.330 --> 44:52.334
Hey, Dad's version of being
a dad is opposite day.

44:55.605 --> 44:58.173
Hey.

44:58.207 --> 44:59.942
Sorry.

45:21.263 --> 45:23.132
Dance with me.

46:26.663 --> 46:28.665
David, I'm going to take care

46:28.698 --> 46:30.265
of that thing that
we talked about, okay?

46:30.299 --> 46:32.434
It's all good.
When I'm done with Conejo,

46:32.468 --> 46:35.270
he's going to wish he stayed
in Mexico selling fucking tacos.

46:40.943 --> 46:43.278
Hey, Conejo's getting
his ass aired out.

46:52.689 --> 46:56.492
I want what you got
with Alexis.

46:56.525 --> 46:58.293
You got your wife,
you've got your kids,

46:58.327 --> 47:00.195
you've got your castle.

47:00.229 --> 47:01.930
You go out there,
you come back here,

47:01.964 --> 47:04.433
you're fucking safe
behind these walls.

47:04.466 --> 47:07.302
Fuck. I'm always living
my life on point.

47:07.336 --> 47:10.072
You know, I'm always watching
for the fucking bullet.

47:12.642 --> 47:14.510
I love my family.

47:14.543 --> 47:16.211
I love God.

47:16.245 --> 47:18.280
Oh, fuck me.

47:18.313 --> 47:20.015
God allows me to walk
through darkness

47:20.048 --> 47:23.419
and come back into the light.

47:23.452 --> 47:25.154
I have two worlds.

47:25.187 --> 47:27.556
You can too.

47:27.590 --> 47:29.258
You think God's
going to have me, fool?

47:29.291 --> 47:31.360
- He will.
- Mm-hmm.

47:31.393 --> 47:33.228
God doesn't exist.

47:33.262 --> 47:35.665
I'm a product
of evolution, David.

47:35.698 --> 47:37.199
I'm supposed to
terrorize the herd.

47:37.232 --> 47:38.434
That's my function.

47:38.467 --> 47:39.702
That's the knowledge
I was born with.

47:39.736 --> 47:41.336
Don't say that.

47:41.370 --> 47:43.405
You know, I've seen
so many motherfuckers die.

47:43.439 --> 47:45.574
So many.
And when the lights go out,

47:45.608 --> 47:47.342
it's just a fucking pile
of meat left.

47:47.376 --> 47:49.411
That's it.

47:49.445 --> 47:52.649
So I know when I die, I die.
That's the end of the book.

47:52.682 --> 47:54.450
I see so many
motherfuckers begging,

47:54.483 --> 47:57.654
pissing, shitting themselves for
one more fucking second of life,

47:57.687 --> 47:59.321
and when I'm there
pulling their card,

47:59.354 --> 48:02.157
I'm their God when I'm there.

48:05.527 --> 48:08.397
When I'm there, I'm God.

48:08.430 --> 48:10.132
Nice house.

48:10.165 --> 48:12.167
What the fuck
is she doing here?

48:12.201 --> 48:16.205
The fuck are you doing here?

48:16.238 --> 48:18.140
Be too bad if somebody
firebombed it

48:18.173 --> 48:21.276
and killed
all these fucking people.

48:21.310 --> 48:23.145
Bitch,
I'll cut your fucking legs off.

48:23.178 --> 48:25.080
Don't you check
your fucking phone?

48:28.585 --> 48:32.354
Your uncle wants you
to sit down with Conejo.

48:32.387 --> 48:34.657
Says we have to make it right.

48:34.691 --> 48:36.525
Fuck you.

48:36.558 --> 48:39.461
You come into my fucking house.
Why the fuck should I trust you?

48:39.495 --> 48:43.733
Baby.

48:43.766 --> 48:46.568
Better fucking hurry.

48:52.207 --> 48:53.509
Wow.

48:53.542 --> 48:56.211
Hey, fool,
that's like the female you.

48:56.245 --> 49:00.349
You guys should get married
and have evil babies and shit.

49:00.382 --> 49:03.118
I ain't going to lie, my boy,
I'm intrigued as fuck.

49:41.791 --> 49:44.426
Where's my uncle at?

49:54.737 --> 49:57.339
The real decisions
are made far from here.

50:10.252 --> 50:13.188
I'm not going to sit here and
listen to a fucking TED Talk.

50:13.221 --> 50:15.190
I was told that
my uncle was here.

50:15.223 --> 50:16.659
So where the fuck is he?

50:16.693 --> 50:20.830
See, when you kill a man
and you don't kill his sons,

50:20.863 --> 50:22.531
this is what happens.

50:25.300 --> 50:28.805
Sometimes it take a minute for
that bullet to hit its target.

50:54.396 --> 50:55.832
Just following orders.

50:55.865 --> 50:58.433
I want you to understand
that I'm not a threat to you.

50:58.467 --> 51:00.903
As a matter of fact,
I'm the only hope you got.

51:00.937 --> 51:02.639
<i>¿Palabra?</i>

51:02.672 --> 51:05.474
You actually thought
that your uncle could help you.

51:05.507 --> 51:08.945
Nah, little homey,
only you could do that.

51:08.978 --> 51:11.581
For how many years have they
promised to open up the books,

51:11.614 --> 51:14.516
have you made into a boss
in the organization?

51:29.564 --> 51:32.835
All you got to do is kiss
the ring and join the family

51:32.869 --> 51:34.671
and I'll give you something
that your uncle

51:34.704 --> 51:37.339
and Wizard have kept from you
all this time.

51:37.372 --> 51:40.208
If Wizard wanted to,
he could give you more power

51:40.242 --> 51:42.879
than you could handle
with just a nod.

51:54.456 --> 51:57.627
♪ Nothing to see, babe

51:57.660 --> 52:00.763
♪ When the lights are on

52:13.609 --> 52:15.845
You said we were protected.

52:15.878 --> 52:21.316
You knew who I was
and what my family was.

52:21.349 --> 52:22.852
Should we run?

52:22.885 --> 52:26.321
There's nowhere to run,
and they'd find us.

52:31.359 --> 52:34.262
I'm sorry I'm scared.
The kids...

52:34.296 --> 52:37.700
Alexis, these are international
players worth billions,

52:37.734 --> 52:42.038
and Wizard and Conejo
are fighting it out right now.

52:42.071 --> 52:44.974
I got my small slice
of the game.

52:45.007 --> 52:46.876
They're way up there.

52:46.909 --> 52:48.945
And I'm down here.

52:48.978 --> 52:50.880
And I ain't shit.

52:54.951 --> 52:59.956
We can't join them,
we can't run, what's left?

52:59.989 --> 53:01.691
I want to fight him.

53:05.494 --> 53:06.896
Okay.

53:06.929 --> 53:08.330
I trust you.

53:08.363 --> 53:09.832
I can't surrender to Conejo.

53:13.401 --> 53:17.673
He's demonic, and I feel it.

53:17.707 --> 53:18.941
Tell me what to do.

53:18.975 --> 53:21.343
Don't change a thing.

53:21.376 --> 53:24.847
Conejo's watching you.

53:24.881 --> 53:26.381
They won't see it coming.

53:30.452 --> 53:32.855
He worked on the number-two guy
in Jalisco.

53:32.889 --> 53:34.456
He's got someone in T.J.

53:34.489 --> 53:36.759
Get him anything
he wants at anyway to San Diego.

53:36.793 --> 53:38.594
He's probably got
a fucking tunnel.

53:38.628 --> 53:40.963
It seems like it, so he can just
clip killers for his mission.

53:40.997 --> 53:42.564
Is no one concerned
his uncle's head

53:42.598 --> 53:44.100
was in a fucking beer cooler?

53:44.133 --> 53:47.603
Where's Wizard in all of this?

53:47.637 --> 53:49.538
I mean, we could use the
high-powered help right now.

53:49.571 --> 53:52.407
I need you to find me this lame
motherfucker so I can kill him.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.743
I'm working on
his location.

53:53.776 --> 53:55.377
Well, work harder.

53:55.410 --> 53:57.546
The guy's streetcraft
is bulletproof, alright?

53:57.580 --> 53:59.582
He sleeps in hotels,
different apartments.

53:59.615 --> 54:01.050
Doesn't trust anyone,
always on the move

54:01.083 --> 54:03.619
so no one knows where he's going
to be hour to hour.

54:03.653 --> 54:05.955
Look, he rolls with a couple
of rock star shooters.

54:05.988 --> 54:07.657
One guy's up from
the Marine Corps Special Forces.

54:07.690 --> 54:08.891
The other one's
a former lieutenant

54:08.925 --> 54:10.358
in the federal
Mexican SWAT team.

54:10.392 --> 54:11.861
Wow.

54:11.894 --> 54:14.396
They're players,
and they got heavy weapons.

54:14.429 --> 54:17.566
Are we not going to talk about
the elephant in the room, David?

54:19.769 --> 54:21.637
Is Wizard next?

54:21.671 --> 54:23.005
Shut the fuck up.

54:27.910 --> 54:32.014
David, get your family
and get the fuck out of LA

54:32.048 --> 54:33.983
until we handle this for you.

54:34.016 --> 54:35.918
No.

54:35.952 --> 54:40.022
Nobody's untouchable.

54:40.056 --> 54:41.958
If it's about money,
we have money for you.

54:41.991 --> 54:44.894
- Yeah sure, it'll help.
- Okay.

54:44.927 --> 54:48.164
But we can do this.
We just need some time.

54:48.197 --> 54:49.732
Maybe a few weeks.

54:49.765 --> 54:50.700
Hey.

54:52.869 --> 54:54.804
You got some of the best
fucking <i>soldados</i>

54:54.837 --> 54:57.572
in the game right here.

54:57.607 --> 54:59.842
Look around, my boy.

54:59.876 --> 55:01.777
Every single one of these
motherfuckers will ride with you

55:01.811 --> 55:03.646
till the wheels fall off.

55:03.679 --> 55:05.114
Now I'm going to hit Conejo,

55:05.147 --> 55:07.482
and I'm going to keep hitting
until one of us is dead,

55:07.515 --> 55:11.187
and so will he, and so will he,
and this sick fuck right here,

55:11.220 --> 55:12.989
you don't think he wants
to spill blood, David?

55:13.022 --> 55:15.591
These are fucking riders, David.

55:15.625 --> 55:18.160
We got you.
Let us do this now.

55:33.109 --> 55:36.779
Okay.

55:36.812 --> 55:38.546
Let's go.

55:45.655 --> 55:48.456
Bang bang.

55:48.490 --> 55:50.593
Conejo's definitely
connected to the cartel.

55:50.626 --> 55:52.228
Plus they give zero fucks.

55:52.261 --> 55:54.496
I mean, this guy has the power

55:54.529 --> 55:56.032
to turn out the entire game
up here.

55:56.065 --> 55:57.867
I need you tell me
how to get to

55:57.900 --> 55:59.835
this lame motherfucker,
that's what I need from you.

55:59.869 --> 56:01.503
I just need some time.

56:17.987 --> 56:21.624
You've got a millionaire
and a stone pillar.

56:36.238 --> 56:37.940
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

56:45.281 --> 56:46.949
Run, run!

57:55.017 --> 57:56.118
Hey.

59:05.187 --> 59:07.089
But I ain't going
to give you nothing but pain.

59:12.128 --> 59:13.729
Hey, <i>puto.</i>

59:58.207 --> 01:00:02.945
I'm going to need
some copies of that ASAP.

01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:06.182
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:08.017
What's going on?
What happened to you?

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:13.422
Tell me what's going on.

01:00:13.455 --> 01:00:15.157
Just drive, Alexis.
Drive the fucking car, okay?

01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:16.492
Okay, okay, baby,
your face is all bloody.

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.260
Stop.
Just get the kids, okay?

01:00:18.294 --> 01:00:19.428
- I am, David.
- Get the fucking kids.

01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:20.896
Stop fucking touching me
already.

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:22.831
I'm trying to keep calm,
but I'm scared.

01:00:22.865 --> 01:00:24.066
- Tell me what's happening.
- Okay, good, good.

01:00:24.099 --> 01:00:26.135
Be scared.
Be very fucking scared.

01:00:26.168 --> 01:00:27.736
Run the fucking light.
Don't stop.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.271
What? No, I'm not going to
run the red light.

01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:33.042
There's a cop behind us, David.
There's a cop behind us.

01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:35.177
Just fucking drive perfectly,
okay?

01:00:37.513 --> 01:00:39.014
Oh, my God.
He's got lights on, David.

01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:40.182
- He's gonna pull us over.
- What?

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:41.517
- He's gonna pull us over.
- No, he's not. No, he's not.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:42.785
- Just calm down.
- Shit. Shit.

01:00:42.818 --> 01:00:44.954
Just calm.

01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:52.394
What's going on?

01:00:52.428 --> 01:00:54.163
A real man knows
when to take a knee

01:00:54.196 --> 01:00:55.965
and serve the stronger master.

01:00:55.998 --> 01:00:57.499
Fuck you, you motherfucker.

01:00:57.533 --> 01:00:59.902
The difference between
a king and a servant,

01:00:59.935 --> 01:01:04.173
the servant acts while the king
masterminds the whole shit.

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:07.509
I got your boy.
He's alive.

01:01:07.543 --> 01:01:10.246
- Is that Creeper?
- Come swoop him up.

01:01:10.279 --> 01:01:12.147
His dog ass right here
crying for you.

01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:14.416
Fuck you,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:16.085
Fuck you.

01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:18.387
Creeper, it's alright, man.
You're going to be okay.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.090
I came as a friend
and I offered you life.

01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:23.125
Now I come as an enemy
and bring you death.

01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:26.061
Motherfucker, fuck you,
you fucking bitch.

01:01:26.095 --> 01:01:29.832
The fuck you doing with that,
you stupid fucking bitch?

01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:31.567
Leave him alone,
you stupid piece of shit!

01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:33.836
What's going on?

01:01:36.939 --> 01:01:38.907
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Oh, my God.

01:01:38.941 --> 01:01:40.943
Let him go, you motherfucker.

01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:46.448
Let him go, motherfucker!

01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:48.951
Leave him alone,
you fucking coward!

01:01:48.984 --> 01:01:51.520
Don't curse me.
This is your truth.

01:01:51.553 --> 01:01:53.155
Your pride cost this.

01:01:53.188 --> 01:01:55.491
I was sent here on a mission
by the real <i>jefes</i>

01:01:55.524 --> 01:01:57.426
to flip the whole
fucking game over.

01:01:57.459 --> 01:01:59.094
Alright, motherfucker,
you fucking made

01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:00.429
your fucking point, homey.

01:02:00.462 --> 01:02:01.930
Leave him alone, motherfucker.

01:02:01.964 --> 01:02:03.499
You want a little kindness
for your friend?

01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:07.002
Mercy? Watch.
Watch my mercy.

01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:09.104
Fuck you.

01:02:09.138 --> 01:02:10.372
You're a shit bitch.

01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:14.376
Hey!

01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:27.590
Everything you love
is going to die real bad.

01:02:42.605 --> 01:02:48.243
Dylan.
Hey. Hey, hey, baby.

01:02:48.277 --> 01:02:50.446
We got to go, okay?

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:55.451
Baby, we need to go right now.

01:02:55.484 --> 01:02:59.388
- But I'm...
- Leave it. Come on.

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.890
Baby, come on.
Come on.

01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.168
Favvy was heading back north
but she's turning around.

01:03:13.202 --> 01:03:14.336
She's going to pick up the kids

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.537
and take them to Fresno
with her.

01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:16.972
Go with.

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:18.540
No.
No, I am not leaving you.

01:03:18.574 --> 01:03:21.343
- Alexis, I'm not asking you.
- Yeah, well, neither am I.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.481
Stay here while I go
get the money.

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.620
I'll stay here.

01:03:30.653 --> 01:03:32.921
Listen.

01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:34.691
We're on our own.

01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:37.359
You don't believe that.

01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.528
I don't need to.

01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:40.896
I know it.

01:03:48.337 --> 01:03:51.173
David, prom... promise me

01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:53.208
that we're going to
start over, please.

01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:03.485
Okay?

01:04:03.519 --> 01:04:05.087
Start over.

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:20.235
Daddy, why do you have a gun?

01:04:54.470 --> 01:05:00.042
Give us this day
our daily bread

01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:02.377
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:05.314
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:05:05.347 --> 01:05:07.449
Lead us not into temptation,

01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:09.351
but deliver us from evil.

01:05:09.384 --> 01:05:11.320
Amen.

01:05:20.195 --> 01:05:21.698
Yo, what the fuck
is going on?

01:05:21.731 --> 01:05:23.332
What the fuck is going on?

01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.367
Hey, hey, stop, stop.
Calm the fuck down, okay?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.270
Hey, if anyone asks, you
haven't fucking seen me, okay?

01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:30.205
Man.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.408
Oh, fuck.

01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:19.689
Fuck.

01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:21.189
How much is that?

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.129
Over a million and a half.

01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:32.735
And that's been there
this whole time?

01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:34.837
Nine years.

01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:37.640
Me and Creeper robbed
an armored car back in the day.

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.679
Crazy.

01:06:47.149 --> 01:06:49.484
You heated up, <i>primo?</i>

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.288
No.

01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:55.324
Here.

01:06:55.357 --> 01:06:57.459
It was your dad's.

01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.829
It's got a lot of murders on it.

01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:03.365
Take it.

01:07:10.472 --> 01:07:11.908
You need me to ride with you?

01:07:11.941 --> 01:07:13.776
You know I got your back.

01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:16.445
No.

01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:48.645
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:07:48.678 --> 01:07:50.947
David, David, stop.
What are you doing, David?

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.347
I know exactly
what the fuck I'm doing.

01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:54.449
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

01:07:54.483 --> 01:07:56.786
Don't let it touch, Alexis.

01:07:56.819 --> 01:07:58.320
She's clean.

01:07:58.353 --> 01:08:00.355
Don't let the family business
touch her.

01:08:00.389 --> 01:08:03.325

it will turn black.

Hey.
Now I'm going to hit Conejo,

Blood, you can't come in.

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:32.181
Then tell Bone that Capone
from the cutdowns is right here.

01:14:43.826 --> 01:14:45.227
Bone.

01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:47.296
Blood out here
name dropping on you.

Hey, y'all, give us a second.

01:14:51.967 --> 01:14:55.971
This might be above
y'all pay grade.

01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:57.740
Now clear it out for me.

01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:01.744
Where's your crew?
Why you by yourself?

01:15:01.777 --> 01:15:05.047
- Everybody's gone, man.
- What you mean, gone?

01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:06.282
Why are you here, bro?

01:15:06.315 --> 01:15:08.017
They killed my wife.

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:10.019
And they killed Creeper, man.

01:15:10.052 --> 01:15:12.154
Mexico's trying to
change the structure.

01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:14.990
They took my kids, man.
They took my kids.

01:15:15.024 --> 01:15:17.660
- What you need?
- I need riders with heart.

01:15:17.693 --> 01:15:19.962
Some motherfucking killers
with choppers, Bone.

01:15:19.995 --> 01:15:21.997
I'm alone, Bone, I'm trying
to do this shit by myself,

01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:23.299
but I ain't got
nobody else, man.

01:15:23.332 --> 01:15:24.800
- Listen, we, I'm...
- I need your help.

01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:27.036
I'm with you, bro. I'm with you.

01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:29.238
- Thumper, we fucking with Blood.
- That's right.

01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:30.973
This is a good motherfucker
here, man.

01:15:31.006 --> 01:15:33.008
- That's right.
- I told you he was a candle.

01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:34.877
- We fucking with you.
- That's right.

01:15:38.848 --> 01:15:43.085
So I'm not saying we're
a bunch of scandalous niggas

01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:47.156
with fucked-up pasts,

01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:51.827
but we got a chance to wash
all our sins away on this one.

01:15:51.861 --> 01:15:54.663
That's a good man, right there.

01:15:54.697 --> 01:15:57.066
He stands for what we stand for.

01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:00.903
And somebody done
took his fucking kids.

01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:03.772
I'm not politicking,
pushing the line,

01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:06.208
shot calling,
none of that bullshit,

01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:10.079
but we going so far down
the rabbit hole on this one,

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:12.314
there might not be
no getting back.

01:16:12.348 --> 01:16:16.719
This is strictly
a volunteer mission.

01:16:16.752 --> 01:16:20.256
'Cause this shit
is heavy as it gets.

01:16:20.289 --> 01:16:23.993
And I ain't never asked y'all to
do nothing that I wouldn't do.

01:16:24.026 --> 01:16:25.995
I'm with the bullshit.

01:16:26.028 --> 01:16:27.229
I'm ready. Fuck it. It's on.

01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:29.198
- Let's go on, man.
- Feel?

01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:30.799
Pablos is on.

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:33.102
Okay, five. What are we doing?

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.371
We're going to get
his kids, homey.

01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:40.409
So let's do it.

01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:43.112
Got you.

01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:33.128
Stupid motherfuckers should
have kept your ass in Mexico.

01:17:33.162 --> 01:17:34.263
Hey.

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:40.469
Where are my kids at, huh?

01:17:40.502 --> 01:17:43.372
- See if you fucking remember.
- Throw his fucking ass out.

01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:54.016

01:18:01.123 --> 01:18:03.158
Fucker.

01:18:03.192 --> 01:18:05.894

01:18:05.928 --> 01:18:08.097
Let's go get your kids.

01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:09.832
We're going to get
your kids, man.

01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:34.857
Go, go!

01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:37.226
- Honey!
- Check the back.

01:18:45.134 --> 01:18:47.169
Ain't no body back here
but Conejo's grandma.

01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:49.505

Dave, how are we
going to do her?

01:19:06.889 --> 01:19:08.824
I ain't going down to his level.

01:19:11.427 --> 01:19:13.462
- Okay.
- Family's sacred.

they're going to be safe.

01:19:36.452 --> 01:19:38.588
- I'm going with you.
- No.

01:19:38.621 --> 01:19:40.255
I got to do this alone.

01:19:40.289 --> 01:19:42.324
No, you're not alone tonight.

01:19:42.358 --> 01:19:47.930
This is me and you till
the fucking wheels fall off.

01:19:47.963 --> 01:19:49.465
It's like that.

01:20:02.111 --> 01:20:04.079
That's the house right there.

01:20:04.113 --> 01:20:06.115
That's Conejo's eyes outside.

01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:09.619
The motherfucker
has a chopper in his hand.

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:10.345
Yeah, that's right, keep coming,
keep coming.

01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:12.314
I'mma dome
your motherfucking ass.

01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:17.119
Drop it.

01:21:19.555 --> 01:21:21.591
Come on.

01:21:30.065 --> 01:21:31.701
Walk.

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.887
Motherfucker.

01:24:04.921 --> 01:24:07.624
Get the fuck over here, bitch.

01:24:14.931 --> 01:24:18.200
All you had to do was say yes,
you stupid motherfucker.

01:24:18.233 --> 01:24:20.569
You caused this.

01:24:20.603 --> 01:24:24.406
Three, two, one, dead.

01:24:27.476 --> 01:24:30.278
Don't defend what's gonna happen
right... right now.

01:24:36.418 --> 01:24:38.487
And your crowd ain't shit.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.355
Just a badass bitch.

01:24:56.606 --> 01:24:58.808
Think.

01:26:14.984 --> 01:26:17.620
It's me, it's me, it's me.

01:26:17.653 --> 01:26:19.488
Come on,
we got to get out of here.

01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:21.389
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

01:26:35.972 --> 01:26:38.074
Taking you to see
my little homegirl.

01:26:38.107 --> 01:26:41.343
She works at USC Medical Center,
patch you up.

01:26:41.376 --> 01:26:42.912
No questions asked.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.823
Pull over.
I got to talk to someone.

01:27:29.058 --> 01:27:31.426
Talk to me.

01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:33.696
Fucking talk to me.

01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:38.366
Congratulations.
You did it.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.804
There were two,
and now there is one.

01:27:41.838 --> 01:27:43.606
How do you know?

01:27:43.639 --> 01:27:46.441
I got the devil on my shoulder
here whispering in my ear.

01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.647
It came for you and you beat it.

01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:53.515
Just like I did in my day.

01:27:55.818 --> 01:28:00.089
You saved me, <i>mijo.</i>
You saved me.

01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:08.130
Now you can stand
under your own sky.

01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:13.501
This pain you feel will go away.

01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:18.540
But the power...

01:28:18.573 --> 01:28:20.610
the power is forever.

01:28:20.643 --> 01:28:24.013
I don't want that.
I want her.

01:28:31.687 --> 01:28:36.692
<i>Mijo,</i> I love you.

01:28:36.726 --> 01:28:38.127
Why are you saying that?

01:28:40.196 --> 01:28:42.765
Why now?

01:28:42.798 --> 01:28:45.768
You never said you loved me.

01:28:45.801 --> 01:28:48.671
'Cause I didn't know
who you are.

01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:50.740
Now I know.

01:28:54.542 --> 01:28:58.748
You and me, we're the same.

01:29:01.117 --> 01:29:04.954
You're a king.

01:29:04.987 --> 01:29:06.889
I don't want it.

01:29:09.158 --> 01:29:17.066
I don't want it, Dad.

01:29:17.099 --> 01:29:18.834
It wants you.

01:29:22.805 --> 01:29:25.641
No.

01:29:25.675 --> 01:29:28.543
No, I don't want that.

01:30:04.313 --> 01:30:06.514
Forgive me.
