WEBVTT

00:00.869 --> 00:01.834
ng wrong.

00:08.296 --> 00:09.795
I'm sorry, Molly.

00:09.831 --> 00:11.197
I love you.

00:11.232 --> 00:12.264
That girl can really work up the tears.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.265
They're calling me

00:13.301 --> 00:14.800
"American Psycho."

00:14.836 --> 00:16.802
The press is all over my hotel.

00:16.838 --> 00:18.204
I'm going crazy.

00:18.239 --> 00:20.139
There's still the little matter

00:20.174 --> 00:22.074
of the 20,000 quid Kaley cost me.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.075
I'll get it.

00:23.111 --> 00:24.110
We have to find Molly's phone

00:24.145 --> 00:26.178
before someone else does.

00:26.214 --> 00:28.147
You want someone to pay
for what happened to your sister.

00:28.182 --> 00:30.983
- My family needs answers.
- Do you remember bagging up

00:31.019 --> 00:32.250
a stuffed monkey from Molly's room?

00:32.286 --> 00:34.449
Who gives a rat's arse
about a stuffed monkey?

00:34.484 --> 00:36.022
Whoever knicked it, that's who.

00:36.057 --> 00:37.890
The tabloids have just handed us

00:37.925 --> 00:39.025
an alternative suspect.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.339
Do you think
that professor knocked her up?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.455
Are you gonna go after him?

00:46.301 --> 00:47.300
Get away from my husband.

00:47.335 --> 00:49.268
Get away from him now.

01:08.103 --> 01:09.098
What is going on?

01:09.134 --> 01:10.389
There's been a shooting, sir.

01:10.425 --> 01:12.358
Hello, mate, Scotland Yard.
I need to talk to her.

01:12.393 --> 01:13.459
Hello, Mrs. Linley.

01:13.495 --> 01:15.495
I'm Detective Sergeant Bruno,

01:15.530 --> 01:17.330
Scotland Yard.
Would you just please tell us

01:17.365 --> 01:18.364
exactly what happened?

01:18.399 --> 01:19.432
He broke into the house.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.267
Mrs. Linley, who?

01:21.302 --> 01:22.235
Who broke into your house?

01:22.270 --> 01:23.269
I was terrified.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.403
I know this is really traumatic for you,

01:24.439 --> 01:26.272
but if you could please, please,

01:26.307 --> 01:27.306
just tell us exactly what happened.

01:27.342 --> 01:28.708
He shot my husband.

01:28.743 --> 01:29.642
Who?

01:29.677 --> 01:32.612
Molly Ryan's brother

01:32.647 --> 01:33.713
shot my husband.

01:46.761 --> 01:53.799

02:10.618 --> 02:12.618
Screw you.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.570
Grace? What's going on?

02:31.659 --> 02:32.658
They want me dead.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.459
- Who?
- The whole world.

02:35.494 --> 02:37.014
Online. Everyone hates me.

02:37.049 --> 02:38.651
Thinks I killed Molly.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.977
Did you sleep at all?

02:41.002 --> 02:42.561
I tried, but...

02:42.596 --> 02:45.704
Hey, I know it's horrible what
those people are saying,

02:45.740 --> 02:47.346
but you can't pay attention to that.

02:47.371 --> 02:49.938
- They don't even know you...
- Carolyn Bloom does.

02:49.963 --> 02:50.955
My friend from camp.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.070
She's posted that

02:52.105 --> 02:54.039
I was always "a bipolar skank,"

02:54.074 --> 02:57.042
and that she's not surprised
I snapped and killed Molly.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.505
- Okay, that's enough.
- Hey!

02:58.541 --> 02:59.647
No, you'll never sleep

02:59.682 --> 03:01.112
- if you keep reading this crap.
- I won't sleep anyway.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.082
You need to rest or
you'll just keep spiraling.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.951
Here. Take one of my sleeping pills.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.991
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

03:24.658 --> 03:27.105
Everything will feel better
once you've gotten some sleep.

03:48.904 --> 03:51.207
- Who is this?
- Does it matter?

03:51.232 --> 03:52.715
I have Molly Ryan's phone.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.263
Like hell you do.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.452
Any idiot can spoof a cell number.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.619
Can any idiot do this?

04:01.459 --> 04:04.260
Handsome friends you have.

04:06.364 --> 04:07.430
Who the hell is this?

04:07.465 --> 04:09.432
I want £30,000

04:09.467 --> 04:13.369
via Bitcoin or this photo
gets lobbed to the FBI,

04:13.404 --> 04:16.372
the Scotland Yard, and
Interpol... for starters.

04:16.406 --> 04:19.308
You have no idea the minefield
you're stepping in.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.278
These men take
their privacy very seriously,

04:22.313 --> 04:25.281
and when they come for you,
and I promise you they will,

04:25.316 --> 04:26.348
they will inflict levels of pain

04:26.384 --> 04:28.317
that you can't even begin to imagine.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.387
Nice try but we both know
you won't say a word...

04:31.422 --> 04:34.423
or they'll come for you first, right?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.462
Turn the damn car around.

04:45.503 --> 04:47.470
That man was screaming

04:47.505 --> 04:50.406
horrible things so I-I grabbed
the rifle and when I went

04:50.441 --> 04:54.243
into the kitchen he was just...
beating my husband.

04:56.347 --> 05:00.714
And then he saw me. Then he
came at me and... I fired.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.218
I think I might have hit him.

05:02.253 --> 05:04.642
That's okay.
You were defending yourself.

05:05.356 --> 05:07.189
So, go on, what happened next?

05:07.225 --> 05:08.257
He pushed me down

05:08.292 --> 05:10.159
and grabbed the gun and...

05:10.194 --> 05:12.228
and he shot Geoffrey in the head.

05:16.167 --> 05:19.101
It's all right, Mrs. Linley,
you've been really brave.

05:21.038 --> 05:21.812
Thanks.

05:23.140 --> 05:25.140
I just need to ask you
a few more questions, okay?

05:25.176 --> 05:26.515
Okay.

05:27.044 --> 05:28.143
Look, when you were living
in Oxford, did you happen

05:28.179 --> 05:30.045
to know a girl by the name
of Hanna Reid?

05:36.163 --> 05:38.354
H-How is that girl possibly relevant

05:38.389 --> 05:39.421
to what happened tonight?

05:39.457 --> 05:41.323
Well, because...

05:41.359 --> 05:43.325
your husband was having
an affair with her,

05:43.361 --> 05:45.261
and she wound up dead.
I know it was ruled

05:45.296 --> 05:46.362
a suicide, but in the light

05:46.397 --> 05:48.297
of the Molly Ryan accusations...

05:48.332 --> 05:50.266
He didn't kill her.

05:52.336 --> 05:54.303
Hanna sent me a letter.

05:54.338 --> 05:55.678
It's a suicide note.

05:55.713 --> 05:57.657
I got it the day after she died.

05:57.682 --> 05:59.074
I still have it.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.142
You have it at home?

06:00.177 --> 06:02.502
Geoffrey was wracked with guilt.

06:02.527 --> 06:04.662
He was the one who had
broken it off and that was

06:04.698 --> 06:06.411
why she...

06:09.120 --> 06:11.420
Anyway, we, uh...

06:11.455 --> 06:14.423
you know, we worked through it.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.960
We moved... moved on with our
lives and we were beginning

06:17.995 --> 06:20.296
to get past this, too, and...

06:24.907 --> 06:28.170
Can I please go
and be with my husband now?

06:30.341 --> 06:32.241
Yeah, of course.

06:35.313 --> 06:38.213
We'll have someone come
and take you to the hospital.

06:38.249 --> 06:40.215
Don't worry, we're gonna
find Patrick Ryan.

06:46.768 --> 06:49.058
We've put out an All Ports
Warning on Patrick Ryan.

06:49.093 --> 06:51.160
I just hope the press
doesn't get a hold of this.

06:51.195 --> 06:52.461
We've got enough headaches already.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.029
I saw this coming.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.064
Patrick Ryan's had a vendetta

06:55.099 --> 06:56.432
since the moment his sister died.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.400
Gwen, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:59.651 --> 07:02.338
Cut yourself
some slack this time, will you?

07:02.373 --> 07:05.274
I know few victim's relatives
that don't have a vendetta.

07:05.309 --> 07:06.942
I'm going home to get changed.

07:06.978 --> 07:08.410
Be careful when you go looking for him.

07:08.446 --> 07:10.800
He's dangerous, Bruno.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.133
Hey, mate.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.169
- Can I help you find something?
- No, I'm good.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.655
You all right?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.173
I'm fine.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.109
What's that in your coat?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.444
Hey.

08:14.509 --> 08:16.442
Every time I close my eyes,
I just keep seeing

08:16.477 --> 08:18.511
all the horrible things
people are posting about me.

08:18.546 --> 08:20.513
They're lies, nothing more.

08:20.548 --> 08:23.349
Come over and I'll help you
forget about everything.

08:23.384 --> 08:25.384
There are paparazzi camped
outside all the hotel doors.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.353
I can't face them right now.

08:27.388 --> 08:28.788
Well, then I'll come to you.

08:28.823 --> 08:31.424
No, they'll just end up taking
some awful picture of you,

08:31.459 --> 08:34.360
saying that we're screwing
our brains out while Molly rots.

08:34.395 --> 08:35.394
This isn't gonna stop, Luc.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.395
It's never gonna stop.

08:36.431 --> 08:37.797
Y-You don't sound good, baby.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.365
I'm just...

08:39.400 --> 08:41.734
I'm just glad my mom's
not here anymore to see

08:41.769 --> 08:44.804
that the whole world
thinks I'm... a sociopath.

08:44.839 --> 08:46.672
I'm coming over.

08:46.707 --> 08:48.574
I don't care what those
idiots write about us.

08:48.609 --> 08:50.643
No, don't, please, don't, I just...

08:50.678 --> 08:52.545
I need to get some sleep.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.580
I'll be... I'll be better
if I can just sleep.

08:54.615 --> 08:56.482
Grace...

08:58.519 --> 09:00.553
I'm not talking street thugs.

09:00.588 --> 09:02.421
This is the Russian mafia.

09:02.457 --> 09:05.391
They... torture people for fun.

09:05.426 --> 09:07.393
If those pictures ever get out, I-I...

09:07.428 --> 09:08.461
Maybe you should think
about that next time

09:08.496 --> 09:10.803
someone asks you
to launder money for them.

09:14.246 --> 09:15.278
Why do you bother?

09:15.470 --> 09:17.336
I mean, aren't you rich enough?

09:17.371 --> 09:18.404
You think when I built my company,

09:18.439 --> 09:20.773
I imagined I would ever
be reduced to working

09:20.808 --> 09:22.341
with criminals?

09:22.376 --> 09:23.709
The market slide in China

09:23.744 --> 09:24.777
killed me.

09:24.812 --> 09:26.712
I needed cash flow just to keep going

09:26.747 --> 09:28.647
or the whole thing
would've fallen apart.

09:28.683 --> 09:29.682
And here we are.

09:30.119 --> 09:31.107
You know, your first

09:31.142 --> 09:32.685
mistake was letting
Molly Ryan blackmail you.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.686
You think?

09:33.721 --> 09:34.753
Note to self,

09:34.789 --> 09:36.655
gonna need to start
a blackmail slush fund

09:36.691 --> 09:38.591
if you want to
keep representing this family.

09:38.626 --> 09:41.234
Your sense of humor
is such a comfort to me.

09:41.259 --> 09:42.595
Tell me you can fix this.

09:42.630 --> 09:44.597
Well, if my suspicions

09:44.665 --> 09:47.566
are correct, which they usually are,

09:47.602 --> 09:48.601
your blackmailer...

09:50.538 --> 09:51.537
needs cash.

09:51.572 --> 09:53.472
He'll play by my rules,

09:53.508 --> 09:54.540
and I

09:54.575 --> 09:56.442
will draw him out of hiding.

09:56.477 --> 09:59.345
What makes you so sure
he'll play by your rules?

09:59.380 --> 10:00.479
Anyone willing to use infamous criminals

10:00.515 --> 10:02.481
as pawns is either daft

10:02.517 --> 10:04.259
or desperate.

10:04.284 --> 10:06.724
Either way, they're going down.

10:11.759 --> 10:13.359
You want your 30,000 pounds,

10:13.394 --> 10:14.393
we do things my way.

10:14.428 --> 10:15.694
ROZ : Who's this?

10:15.730 --> 10:16.428
You first.

10:16.464 --> 10:17.396
You a copper?

10:17.431 --> 10:18.831
Like James would risk
going to the police.

10:18.866 --> 10:21.734
Well, whoever you are,
I better see a deposit

10:21.769 --> 10:25.604
in my Bitcoin account by noon
or James is going to have

10:25.640 --> 10:27.673
much bigger problems than the police.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.708
Enough of this Bitcoin nonsense,
it's not secure.

10:29.744 --> 10:31.710
We're gonna do things old school.

10:31.746 --> 10:34.547
Now pay attention, because
I'm only gonna say this once.

10:34.582 --> 10:35.648
Get yourself on the 2:00 p.m. bus

10:35.683 --> 10:37.616
from Camden Town to Leicester Square.

10:37.652 --> 10:40.586
You'll find a blue backpack
on the upper deck under seat

10:40.621 --> 10:41.587
13-B.

10:41.622 --> 10:42.621
Take the backpack,

10:42.657 --> 10:44.557
leave the phone on the seat,

10:44.592 --> 10:45.591
and be on your merry way.

10:45.626 --> 10:47.493
You're not dictating the terms here.

10:47.528 --> 10:48.861
I am.

10:48.896 --> 10:51.830
It's Bitcoin, or I swear
to God I hit send.

10:51.866 --> 10:53.399
Go ahead, hit send.

10:53.434 --> 10:55.434
My guess is, you'd rather
take the pounds.

10:55.469 --> 10:57.403
2:00 p.m., Camden Town, upper deck.

11:01.742 --> 11:03.342
What the hell was that about?

11:06.339 --> 11:07.372
Roz...

11:09.275 --> 11:11.141
The less you know, the better.

11:11.819 --> 11:13.686
Is this about Finch?

11:13.721 --> 11:14.720
I don't want you getting

11:14.755 --> 11:15.688
in any trouble because of me.

11:15.723 --> 11:17.891
I've got it under control.

11:29.570 --> 11:32.076
You really do like to pop by, don't you?

11:32.111 --> 11:34.025
I should get you your own key.

11:34.095 --> 11:35.961
- Grace is losing it.
- Really? Big surprise.

11:35.998 --> 11:37.064
Listen, I'm kind of

11:37.099 --> 11:38.932
in the middle of a thing right now,

11:38.967 --> 11:40.327
so unless this is DEFCON Five...

11:40.362 --> 11:41.494
I got to get her out of London.

11:41.519 --> 11:43.870
She's wigging out. She can't go outside

11:43.906 --> 11:45.305
without the obnoxious British
press crawling up her ass,

11:45.340 --> 11:47.274
and people are posting horrible things

11:47.309 --> 11:48.842
- about her.
- Yeah, people are

11:48.877 --> 11:50.243
- so mean.
- This is serious, Stan.

11:50.279 --> 11:52.245
We need to get Grace's passport back.

11:52.281 --> 11:54.881
I did some research, and we
might be able to get it released

11:54.917 --> 11:56.249
under Section 29B
of the Criminal Code...

11:56.285 --> 11:57.784
Which doesn't apply

11:57.820 --> 11:59.219
anymore ever since your
little trip to Paris.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.154
We need to go home.

12:01.190 --> 12:03.190
It's not healthy for Grace here,
and my boss is running out

12:03.225 --> 12:05.245
of patience with my little
sabbatical, so you need

12:05.776 --> 12:09.096
to do whatever it is you do
when the law isn't your friend.

12:09.131 --> 12:10.230
You want me to bribe someone?

12:10.265 --> 12:11.231
I don't want to micromanage you.

12:11.266 --> 12:12.199
I just want it done.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.134
Cool, I like the new you.

12:14.169 --> 12:16.002
Uh, but later, 'cause I got to go, okay?

12:20.856 --> 12:24.111
Got a call from a corner shop
in Bromley.

12:24.146 --> 12:26.367
Irish shoplifter, covered in blood,

12:26.403 --> 12:29.276
cashier IDs him as Patrick Ryan.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.781
What is he still doing in the city?

12:31.806 --> 12:34.741
He... he could've made
for the coast, rented a boat,

12:34.766 --> 12:36.068
sailed back to Ireland.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.025
Linley's out of surgery.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.926
Still alive, but barely.

12:39.962 --> 12:41.828
Executed a search warrant

12:41.864 --> 12:43.377
of his primary residence and found this:

12:43.408 --> 12:44.898
Hanna Reid's suicide note.

12:44.933 --> 12:45.899
Wow.

12:45.934 --> 12:47.172
His wife wasn't lying.

12:47.197 --> 12:48.973
So this is one girl he didn't kill,

12:49.009 --> 12:50.270
at least not by his own hand.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.205
She might not be the only one.

12:52.241 --> 12:56.176
Also found a burner
hidden in his closet.

12:56.211 --> 12:57.623
Take a look at this self-portrait.

12:57.658 --> 12:59.146
Whoa, whoa.

12:59.181 --> 13:00.213
Need a little warning before

13:00.249 --> 13:01.248
you flash me a todger, please, mate.

13:01.283 --> 13:03.116
Look, if you look closely...

13:03.152 --> 13:04.151
No... I'd rather not.

13:06.754 --> 13:08.221
It was taken in his house

13:08.838 --> 13:10.123
on the 29 of March,

13:10.159 --> 13:14.060
at 2:37 a.m.

13:14.129 --> 13:16.963
Molly Ryan was killed
around 2:45 that night.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.098
Way across town.

13:19.057 --> 13:20.934
Linley didn't kill her.

13:20.969 --> 13:23.870
Professor has sexted himself
a rock hard alibi.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.195
If Linley dies...

13:26.074 --> 13:27.974
Patrick Ryan just killed
an innocent man.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.160
Don't scream.

13:50.232 --> 13:52.265
I'm not here to hurt you.

13:57.478 --> 13:59.091
You shot Linley.

14:00.142 --> 14:01.141
No, I didn't.

14:01.176 --> 14:02.750
I swear.

14:03.145 --> 14:04.945
Then why did you run?

14:08.050 --> 14:10.032
'Cause no one'd believe me...

14:11.019 --> 14:12.986
except maybe you.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.759
Why should I believe you?

14:21.029 --> 14:23.473
You as much as told me
you were going after Linley.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.267
I've seen your record, remember?

14:27.302 --> 14:28.868
Assault, robbery...

14:28.904 --> 14:30.837
That was a long time ago.

14:30.872 --> 14:32.948
I'm telling you,
I did not shoot that man.

14:34.243 --> 14:36.176
You're bleeding.

14:36.211 --> 14:38.245
I'm fine.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.279
Hardly.

14:39.314 --> 14:41.034
Come on, sit down.

15:12.848 --> 15:13.913
Damn it.

15:17.599 --> 15:18.598
Grace?

15:28.798 --> 15:30.129
Grace.

15:31.199 --> 15:32.165
Oh, my God.

15:32.824 --> 15:34.200
Grace.

15:34.236 --> 15:35.201
Grace, wake up!

15:35.237 --> 15:37.103
Grace! Grace, wake up!

15:42.038 --> 15:44.038
_

15:44.885 --> 15:46.680
We need to pump your sister's stomach.

15:46.705 --> 15:48.787
You need to wait out here.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.545
I'm sorry to disturb you,

16:00.580 --> 16:03.282
but we're running a bit behind,
Your Highness.

16:03.307 --> 16:06.024
How can I go out there
and smile all pretty

16:06.060 --> 16:08.276
for an engagement portrait
when any minute now the police

16:08.311 --> 16:11.291
could discover my...
relationship with Molly Ryan.

16:11.475 --> 16:12.463
Molly...

16:12.597 --> 16:14.886
was well-compensated to keep

16:14.922 --> 16:16.199
her mouth shut.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.200
She was also compensated

16:17.235 --> 16:19.169
to stay on the pill.

16:19.204 --> 16:20.603
I have no idea how many
loose ends are out there.

16:20.639 --> 16:24.140
We'll find someone
inside the investigation, hmm?

16:24.176 --> 16:26.667
Someone with a weakness to exploit.

16:26.703 --> 16:28.020
Even commoners do things

16:28.055 --> 16:29.479
they shouldn't, Your Highness.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.482
Am I interrupting?

16:33.518 --> 16:34.844
Wow.

16:35.454 --> 16:37.353
You look... amazing.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.006
I'd better.

16:39.042 --> 16:42.258
17 people worked me
over for this portrait.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.326
For some reason,
they completely rejected

16:43.361 --> 16:45.233
my idea to wear my old trackies.

16:45.269 --> 16:46.859
I love you in your old trackies.

16:46.894 --> 16:48.364
I'm not sure your mum would.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.167
My mum's hardly setting
the fashion world on fire.

16:52.204 --> 16:53.636
Yes... but the public

16:53.672 --> 16:55.171
have slightly higher standards

16:55.207 --> 16:56.573
for a wannabe princess.

16:58.276 --> 17:03.113
The public will love you
for the same reason I love you.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.548
You're a brilliant, charming,

17:05.584 --> 17:09.551
independent woman who says and
does exactly as she pleases.

17:18.463 --> 17:19.429
Cheers, lad.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.536
Tough crowd.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.405
Yo, yo, yo, DJ Roz.

17:29.441 --> 17:32.308
Wankers wouldn't know talent
if it hit them in the head.

17:33.378 --> 17:34.377
No, it'll rain.

17:34.412 --> 17:35.478
Just need to keep drumming.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.248
Or you could find a more lucrative way

17:38.283 --> 17:40.283
to spend your afternoon.

17:42.387 --> 17:44.154
I'm all ears.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.542
Excuse me?

18:05.577 --> 18:07.510
Are you Grace Atwood's sister?

18:07.858 --> 18:08.857
Yes.

18:09.432 --> 18:10.446
Is Grace okay?

18:11.221 --> 18:12.303
Did she wake up?

18:12.338 --> 18:13.870
I'm sorry, I...

18:13.895 --> 18:16.419
don't have a report from the doctor yet.

18:16.454 --> 18:19.489
I just need to take down some
information about the incident.

18:19.524 --> 18:21.491
Can you tell me what
happened to your sister?

18:27.877 --> 18:28.877
I, um...

18:28.902 --> 18:31.301
I think she took
too many sleeping pills.

18:31.336 --> 18:33.045
Did she have a prescription?

18:33.081 --> 18:34.400
No.

18:35.725 --> 18:37.207
They were mine.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.176
Do you think your sister
tried to take her own life?

18:40.212 --> 18:43.213
I don't think she'd do that, but I...

18:43.248 --> 18:44.732
Do you think she's

18:44.768 --> 18:47.183
feeling guilty
about something she's done?

18:47.807 --> 18:50.185
Sometimes that can
trigger a suicide attempt.

18:54.164 --> 18:56.125
You're not with the hospital, are you?

18:56.913 --> 18:58.494
Never said I was.

18:59.089 --> 19:00.735
My name's Veena Patel,

19:01.216 --> 19:02.465
I'm a reporter for The Story.

19:03.044 --> 19:04.063
Yeah.

19:04.889 --> 19:06.402
I have a story for you.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.437
Once upon a time, there was

19:07.472 --> 19:08.504
a little girl who dreamt

19:08.540 --> 19:10.440
of being a real journalist,

19:10.768 --> 19:12.408
but it turns out she's a no talent hack

19:12.444 --> 19:15.378
who's not pretty enough
to be a TV anchor,

19:15.413 --> 19:16.479
so she's stuck at a low rent rag

19:16.514 --> 19:19.382
with more ads for hookers
than genuine news.

19:19.417 --> 19:20.350
You know what

19:20.385 --> 19:23.253
I think the real story is here?

19:23.288 --> 19:24.354
How you're gonna live with yourself

19:24.389 --> 19:30.159
if Grace dies after taking your pills.

19:39.271 --> 19:41.137
It's a through-and-through.

19:41.172 --> 19:42.205
Missed your arteries.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.173
You're lucky.

19:44.209 --> 19:45.608
Luckier than Linley.

19:54.895 --> 19:55.961
What happened in that cottage?

19:57.522 --> 19:58.554
I went there to look

19:58.590 --> 20:00.390
that coward in the eye.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.427
Have him tell me if he killed my sister.

20:04.462 --> 20:05.528
Then his wife came in, waving

20:05.563 --> 20:08.464
a rifle, shot him, so I ran.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.300
That's when she shot me, too.

20:12.404 --> 20:14.258
You should have called the police.

20:14.283 --> 20:15.438
You think the police are gonna believe

20:15.473 --> 20:17.440
a Northern Irish stonemason
with a criminal record

20:17.475 --> 20:20.243
over some posh, English housewife?

20:20.278 --> 20:22.312
It's not 30 years ago, Patrick.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.431
Come on, give us some credit.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.250
I've got a ma back home.

20:27.285 --> 20:28.938
She can't get

20:28.963 --> 20:30.253
out of bed, she's so wrecked

20:30.288 --> 20:32.064
from losing her little girl.

20:32.657 --> 20:34.223
She's counting

20:34.259 --> 20:36.626
on me to get justice for our family.

20:38.099 --> 20:40.201
That's not going to happen
if I get locked up

20:40.235 --> 20:41.890
for something I didn't do.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.472
That's why I need you to believe me.

20:51.101 --> 20:52.507
You have to believe me.

20:55.153 --> 20:57.312
I do.

21:00.418 --> 21:01.417
No, you don't.

21:04.884 --> 21:05.883
Patrick.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.392
Ah, it was a mistake to come here.

21:09.427 --> 21:11.227
No, it wasn't.

21:11.262 --> 21:12.583
I want to help you.

21:21.544 --> 21:22.510
Help me, huh?

21:25.930 --> 21:26.962
Patrick.

21:34.318 --> 21:35.518
Patrick Ryan.

21:37.489 --> 21:39.522
Don't you do that. Come here!

22:48.535 --> 22:50.568
- Huh?
- It's not your stop, kid.

22:50.604 --> 22:51.780
- Let go of me.
- Happy to.

22:51.816 --> 22:53.571
Soon as I get what I came for.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.057
You have the phone, mate. Back off.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.508
Yeah, but I need a name.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.543
Unless you're the one calling the shots,

22:58.578 --> 23:01.413
but you don't really strike me
as the strategic type.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.381
No. You were paid to make the drop.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.417
So let me tell you how it's gonna be,

23:05.452 --> 23:06.580
I'll give you a nice, hefty raise,

23:06.605 --> 23:07.763
you tell me who hired you.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.759
Manchester! Manchester! Manchester!

23:14.795 --> 23:15.827
- Let go of me, Mister.
- Give me the bag, kid.

23:15.862 --> 23:16.828
Manchester!

23:16.863 --> 23:19.364
Manchester! Manchester!

23:19.399 --> 23:20.765
What's going on here?

23:20.801 --> 23:22.734
This pervert bothering you, kid?

23:22.769 --> 23:23.835
Yeah, he's not letting me leave.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.370
I'm making a citizen's arrest,

23:25.405 --> 23:26.805
- the kid stole my bag.
- This bag here?

23:26.840 --> 23:28.740
- Give me that?
- Worth knickin', is it?

23:28.775 --> 23:29.741
Give it here. Give me that bag.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.776
- Give me the bag!
- Ooh, nice phone there,

23:31.812 --> 23:33.611
glitter boy.

23:33.647 --> 23:34.612
Wha...

23:34.648 --> 23:35.447
What, you don't have one of those?

23:35.482 --> 23:36.648
Give me that ba...

23:40.620 --> 23:41.619
Whoa!

23:41.655 --> 23:43.655
Looks like we hit the lotto here, boys.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.657
Right, let's get out of here.
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.493
Go, go, go, go.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.561
See ya later, egghead.

23:53.467 --> 23:54.566
Glitter boy!

24:10.139 --> 24:11.851
Natalie?

24:13.308 --> 24:14.340
Gracie.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.023
I was so worried I was gonna lose you.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.262
Are we at the hospital?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.032
Yes.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.934
You took too many sleeping pills.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.589
I couldn't sleep.

24:32.624 --> 24:34.630
I-I just kept hearing all the haters.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.039
Grace,

24:36.414 --> 24:37.909
did you try to...

24:37.943 --> 24:39.009
No.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.402
No, it was...

24:41.437 --> 24:42.813
it-it was an accident.

24:42.848 --> 24:43.880
I...

24:44.721 --> 24:46.784
I was just so tired.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.728
I must've...

24:49.149 --> 24:50.854
I must've lost track
of how many I'd taken.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.483
Oh, God.

24:57.479 --> 24:58.728
Is it all over the Internet?

24:59.502 --> 25:00.764
Ugh.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.732
Bet the haters loved that.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.101
You don't have to worry about
that right now, okay?

25:05.350 --> 25:08.039
All you need to do is rest.

25:14.661 --> 25:15.834
Hey.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.981
Will you do something for me?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.049
Yeah.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.884
Anything.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.019
Will you get me a banana milkshake?

25:23.848 --> 25:24.921
From Fatboys?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.824
Grace, Fatboys is, like,
all the way back by our hotel.

25:27.849 --> 25:29.893
I think they have ice cream
in the cafeteria.

25:29.928 --> 25:30.927
I know.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.863
My stomach really hurts

25:32.898 --> 25:35.799
and that is literally the only
thing that sounds good.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.768
Please?

25:38.804 --> 25:39.803
Okay, fine.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.774
I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.147
You'll be pleased to know
that Molly Ryan's phone

25:51.183 --> 25:53.149
is out of your blackmailer's hands.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.550
Oh, thank God.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.120
Who was behind this?

25:57.155 --> 25:59.022
You really think it'll improve your mood

25:59.057 --> 26:00.957
to know the name of
the street punk that milked you

26:00.993 --> 26:02.025
for 30,000 quid?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.960
This better be the end of it, Gutterie.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.095
Oh, I completely agree.

26:20.946 --> 26:23.847
There have been a lot of people
hating on me

26:23.882 --> 26:24.881
since my friend Molly died.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.216
Oh, for Pete's sake.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.784
A lot.

26:28.957 --> 26:30.708
And I'm not gonna lie,

26:32.470 --> 26:33.721
it sucks.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.375
But I kind of get it.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.131
If I was out there watching
all the press on me,

26:40.165 --> 26:42.198
I'd-I'd probably think that I was...

26:43.104 --> 26:44.101
a slut,

26:44.456 --> 26:45.785
a druggie,

26:46.071 --> 26:48.512
a selfish irresponsible bitch.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.074
And the stuff that's already come out,

26:51.527 --> 26:53.376
well, that's just the beginning.

26:54.441 --> 26:56.948
Keep digging.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.883
'Cause you're gonna find out that I...

26:59.918 --> 27:02.437
screwed my best friend's
boyfriend in high school,

27:02.773 --> 27:06.613
I... was arrested for stealing
some nail polish

27:06.648 --> 27:07.984
a couple of years ago.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.829
And part of the reason
I came over here was because...

27:11.863 --> 27:13.830
I was flunking out of college.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.866
I've made some major mistakes.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.868
But there's one thing I didn't do.

27:19.827 --> 27:22.499
I didn't kill Molly Ryan.

27:23.543 --> 27:25.142
She was my friend.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.224
She knew all that crap about me,
and she still loved me.

27:29.354 --> 27:30.894
So if you've never made any mistakes,

27:30.929 --> 27:32.215
then go ahead,

27:33.126 --> 27:34.118
keep hating on me.

27:34.830 --> 27:37.020
But if you've ever screwed up,

27:37.365 --> 27:39.022
maybe stop and think for a minute

27:39.057 --> 27:41.024
before you attack me
or anyone else out there

27:41.059 --> 27:42.993
who's having a bad time.

28:03.751 --> 28:04.817
From the looks of that bullet wound,

28:04.852 --> 28:06.984
Patrick was shot from behind,
not from the front.

28:07.009 --> 28:08.595
Oh, so you're a gunshot wound
expert now, aye?

28:08.790 --> 28:10.724
Enough to know an entry wound
from an exit wound.

28:10.759 --> 28:12.548
And his fingerprints, they
weren't on the gun, were they?

28:13.165 --> 28:14.694
Look at his hands.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.162
There ain't no way
that he was wearing gloves

28:16.198 --> 28:17.764
when he was beating on Linley.

28:17.799 --> 28:19.699
And I'm guessing he didn't stop
to put some on

28:19.735 --> 28:21.067
before he went after the wife's gun.

28:21.103 --> 28:22.135
I don't think he ever
touched the gun, mate,

28:22.170 --> 28:24.070
Oh, bloody hell.

28:24.106 --> 28:26.072
Beatrice Linley shot her own husband.

28:26.108 --> 28:28.493
And we let her walk right out of here.

28:29.194 --> 28:30.696
Straight back to his bedside.

29:03.345 --> 29:04.377
Are you my nurse?

29:07.282 --> 29:08.528
Strange, isn't it?

29:09.350 --> 29:10.651
You put me in the hospital

29:10.685 --> 29:12.285
and now here you are.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.720
Mrs. Linley.

29:13.755 --> 29:15.255
What are you doing here?

29:15.290 --> 29:16.623
Truthfully,

29:16.658 --> 29:18.258
I'm not sure anymore.

29:19.442 --> 29:21.662
I'm sorry about what happened
between me and your husband,

29:21.696 --> 29:23.596
and for slashing your tires.

29:23.632 --> 29:25.598
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.

29:25.634 --> 29:27.567
You know when...

29:27.602 --> 29:30.637
the first time I found out
Geoffrey had had an affair,

29:30.672 --> 29:33.640
it hurt deeply.

29:33.675 --> 29:36.442
And he was so sorry,

29:36.478 --> 29:39.512
and he tried so hard
to make it up to me,

29:39.548 --> 29:41.481
and no one else knew about it,

29:41.516 --> 29:42.940
except the girl.

29:43.952 --> 29:46.892
But, anyway, it was our business.

29:47.355 --> 29:49.422
And then last week,

29:49.457 --> 29:52.292
I wake up and it's all over
the papers that my husband

29:52.327 --> 29:53.760
is having an affair with you.

29:53.795 --> 29:56.296
Maybe Molly Ryan too.

29:56.331 --> 29:57.730
That he might've killed her.

29:57.766 --> 29:59.365
But then the police told me

29:59.401 --> 30:02.769
he's been shagging
his students for years.

30:02.804 --> 30:06.773
So I have been a bloody fool
this whole time.

30:07.747 --> 30:08.608
And now everybody knows,

30:08.643 --> 30:10.710
and everybody pities me and judges me.

30:10.745 --> 30:14.647
He made a mockery of my life,

30:14.683 --> 30:15.648
and so did you.

30:23.032 --> 30:24.083
What's happened?

30:24.118 --> 30:25.491
- We got to the room right after
you called it in.

30:25.527 --> 30:26.526
Patient was already coding.

30:26.561 --> 30:28.561
Looks like his respirator's
been messed with.

30:28.597 --> 30:31.497
I'm calling it. Time of death, 9:13 p.m.

30:32.567 --> 30:34.400
You seen the wife?

30:34.436 --> 30:35.501
Where's Beatrice Linley?

30:36.730 --> 30:38.338
I'm so sorry,

30:38.406 --> 30:39.890
Mrs. Linley.

30:39.915 --> 30:42.091
You have already said you are sorry.

30:43.954 --> 30:44.811
So did Geoffrey.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.183
But I killed him anyway.

31:04.899 --> 31:06.444
Do you feel better...

31:07.602 --> 31:09.669
now that he's gone?

31:16.511 --> 31:18.511
No.

31:24.529 --> 31:27.387
I don't suppose killing you
will help, either.

31:37.309 --> 31:38.524
Step back, Mrs. Linley.

31:52.807 --> 31:54.160
How you doing?

31:57.576 --> 31:58.751
Oh, you know.

31:59.381 --> 32:01.187
My sister got her stomach pumped.

32:01.655 --> 32:03.936
She almost got killed by a crazy woman.

32:05.349 --> 32:06.987
So I guess I've had better days.

32:07.630 --> 32:09.000
Yeah, you've, um...

32:10.313 --> 32:11.564
had more than your fair share
of troubles

32:11.599 --> 32:13.533
since you came to London, haven't you?

32:14.777 --> 32:16.157
Yeah, but it's fine.

32:17.482 --> 32:18.816
It's all fine, you know?

32:19.213 --> 32:21.407
They're releasing Grace today.

32:21.846 --> 32:24.933
So I have no idea why I'm crying.

32:25.884 --> 32:27.950
It's okay, it's a lot for anyone.

32:30.460 --> 32:31.931
Don't do that.

32:32.755 --> 32:35.388
Don't be nice to me, 'cause
it's just gonna make it worse.

32:47.072 --> 32:48.648
See?

32:52.841 --> 32:55.608
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

33:03.327 --> 33:06.006
I never cry in front of the cops
that I work with at home.

33:07.066 --> 33:08.113
I swear.

33:08.148 --> 33:10.523
I won't tell them, don't worry.

33:34.336 --> 33:36.706
Clever girl, aren't you?

33:42.754 --> 33:43.720
And the phone?

33:43.755 --> 33:45.121
It's in there.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.160
Brilliant.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.945
Thank you.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.918
You were telling the truth.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.853
Beatrice Linley shot the Professor.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.485
She's in custody as we speak.

34:19.487 --> 34:20.681
Then I'm free to go?

34:20.706 --> 34:21.757
No.

34:21.793 --> 34:22.759
There's a little matter

34:22.793 --> 34:23.726
of breaking into a man's home,

34:23.762 --> 34:24.726
assaulting him.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.451
Those are serious charges.

34:27.310 --> 34:29.799
It could put you away
for quite some time.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.668
I can't look the other way
just because I...

34:35.210 --> 34:36.672
Just because you what?

34:44.114 --> 34:46.716
I would like to make a deal
with you, Patrick.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.053
I don't do deals
with people I don't trust.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.688
I'm not sure you have a choice.

34:54.364 --> 34:55.603
Linley's dead.

34:55.638 --> 34:57.966
His good wife finished the job
in the hospital.

34:57.991 --> 35:01.931
Which means, I can make
the assault charge go away.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.900
But for me to even consider it,

35:03.935 --> 35:05.614
you need to assure me,

35:05.639 --> 35:06.970
when you walk out that door,
you'll go to the port.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.564
Get on a ferry.

35:08.599 --> 35:09.939
Go back to Belfast.

35:12.181 --> 35:14.148
Molly's killer will not go unpunished.

35:14.347 --> 35:15.413
Not on my watch.

35:16.881 --> 35:17.814
But...

35:17.849 --> 35:18.881
if you can't agree to that,

35:18.917 --> 35:20.817
you're welcome to stay in London...

35:20.852 --> 35:22.796
in a jail cell.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.725
Well, I'm ready to go home.

35:44.479 --> 35:46.111
Hello?

36:05.700 --> 36:07.864
What the hell is going on?

36:07.899 --> 36:08.898
Y-Your... Your... Your...

36:08.933 --> 36:10.888
Royal Highness, Sir?

36:11.201 --> 36:12.386
Oh, we can dispense

36:12.411 --> 36:13.519
with the formalities.

36:13.544 --> 36:16.104
I feel like we're
going to be close chums.

36:21.662 --> 36:23.357
I hope you don't mind me
using your kitchen.

36:23.435 --> 36:24.467
I got rather hungry waiting for you.

36:24.503 --> 36:25.502
And then Phillip, here,

36:25.537 --> 36:27.470
refused to run out and get a curry.

36:27.506 --> 36:29.322
Now, he...

36:29.357 --> 36:31.441
wanted to handle this himself,

36:31.476 --> 36:32.475
but I needed to make sure

36:32.511 --> 36:34.411
that you understood the full gravity

36:34.446 --> 36:35.845
of our situation.

36:35.881 --> 36:37.414
Our situation.

36:37.449 --> 36:38.448
Hmm.

36:38.483 --> 36:39.783
All right.

36:41.749 --> 36:43.787
And what exactly is that?

36:45.857 --> 36:47.757
Please, take a seat.

36:47.793 --> 36:49.392
You look like you've had a long day.

36:54.766 --> 36:56.163
Now,

36:57.369 --> 36:58.802
I would have whipped up
something more interesting,

36:58.837 --> 37:00.804
but you're a bit of a cliché bachelor

37:00.839 --> 37:02.705
with no real food in the cupboards,

37:02.741 --> 37:04.674
so... parmesan?

37:06.645 --> 37:07.710
Yeah, please.

37:07.746 --> 37:09.579
So I, uh...

37:10.194 --> 37:11.648
had to improvise.

37:13.585 --> 37:14.717
Let's call it...

37:15.494 --> 37:17.520
Pasta...

37:17.556 --> 37:18.569
Bruno.

37:20.264 --> 37:22.525
Please, eat.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.461
I don't have many marketable skills,

37:24.496 --> 37:26.529
but I really am quite the cook.

37:27.048 --> 37:28.498
To my mum's dismay.

37:30.784 --> 37:32.435
We gonna have to get
to the dessert course

37:32.471 --> 37:34.404
before you tell me
what you're doing here?

37:35.930 --> 37:36.929
No small talk.

37:38.510 --> 37:40.376
You must be disastrous
at dinner parties.

37:42.401 --> 37:43.846
All right, then.

37:43.882 --> 37:46.778
Let's talk about something
that may interest you.

37:47.452 --> 37:49.452
What was that man's name again, Phillip?

37:49.488 --> 37:52.388
Donovan Trimbly, Your Highness.

37:56.662 --> 37:58.595
Donovan Trimbly.

38:00.799 --> 38:02.732
He didn't bring the best out
in you, now did he?

38:02.767 --> 38:04.801
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:07.806 --> 38:09.706
You can lie to your colleagues.

38:09.741 --> 38:11.641
You can lie to your boss.

38:12.025 --> 38:13.381
You can even lie

38:13.416 --> 38:14.677
to your mum.

38:16.648 --> 38:22.685
But you will never lie to me, Detective.

38:25.557 --> 38:26.556
What do you want?

38:27.136 --> 38:28.889
You keep my secrets.

38:30.145 --> 38:32.561
I'll keep yours.

38:33.632 --> 38:34.597
Oh, my God.

38:34.633 --> 38:37.600
I've always wanted to do this.

38:37.636 --> 38:40.470
Ah.

38:40.505 --> 38:42.438
Come on, don't be shy.

38:47.512 --> 38:49.512
How does it feel?

38:49.548 --> 38:51.505
Like winning.

38:53.585 --> 38:55.451
Mmm.

38:55.487 --> 38:58.354
We should start robbing banks
if you're this hot for it.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.325
No.

39:04.362 --> 39:06.842
I was going crazy today

39:07.365 --> 39:08.914
waiting for you to get back.

39:09.367 --> 39:12.307
It's just... promise me
you'll pay off Finch

39:13.201 --> 39:14.928
and you won't put yourself in danger

39:14.953 --> 39:16.406
on my account ever again.

39:16.802 --> 39:21.344
I'll do whatever I need to do
to keep... you safe.

39:34.759 --> 39:35.792
What happened to you?

39:36.615 --> 39:38.393
I thought I'd take the bus.

39:38.428 --> 39:39.557
It wasn't for me.

39:39.592 --> 39:41.831
Hope you took it
to get Grace's passport back.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.668
You know, I am not
batting a thousand today.

39:45.704 --> 39:48.771
Apparently, the magistrate
assigned to Grace's file

39:48.807 --> 39:51.535
does not find me as charming as you.

39:51.743 --> 39:53.566
That is truly shocking.

39:54.746 --> 39:56.695
So that means we're stuck here

39:56.730 --> 39:58.615
until Grace is officially exonerated?

39:58.650 --> 39:59.988
Yeah, kind of.

40:00.619 --> 40:02.619
Although, there is one silver lining.

40:02.654 --> 40:03.686
Turns out

40:03.722 --> 40:05.722
your sister's
a natural born spin doctor.

40:05.757 --> 40:08.558
BBC, Daily Mail,

40:08.593 --> 40:10.593
the entire British press corps,

40:10.629 --> 40:13.148
is eating up her little confessional.

40:13.394 --> 40:15.714
Meryl Streep would be jealous
of that performance.

40:16.550 --> 40:17.953
Performance?

40:17.988 --> 40:20.603
If a client of mine asked me
to pull them out

40:20.639 --> 40:23.573
from under an avalanche
of negative publicity,

40:23.608 --> 40:26.509
and not just pull them out, but to turn

40:26.544 --> 40:29.545
that avalanche
into a worldwide lovefest,

40:29.581 --> 40:31.581
I could not have
scripted it better myself.
