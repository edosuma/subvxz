03:30.567 --> 03:33.067
SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE
DONE FOR FREE.

03:33.067 --> 03:35.067
THAT MONEY COULD PAY FOR
BOBBY'S COLLEGE

03:35.100 --> 03:36.933
AND A MINI-FRIDGE
FOR HIS DORM ROOM.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.367

04:23.500 --> 04:26.233
UH... I'M JUST SEEING
WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE

04:26.300 --> 04:28.200
FOR DON MEREDITH
AT THE SUPERDOME.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.500
HOW ABOUT
I COME WITH?

04:29.567 --> 04:31.433
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO EAT FRIED DOUGH

04:31.500 --> 04:33.400
IN THE MOST CORRUPT
CITY ON EARTH.

04:33.467 --> 04:37.100
UH... THAT'S NICE AND ALL,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.733
IT'S NO BOTHER.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.200
YOU CAN DRIVE US, AND WE'LL
STAY IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

04:42.267 --> 04:43.300
UH, WELL...

04:43.367 --> 04:44.733
I GUESS WE COULD...

04:44.800 --> 04:45.867
WINGO, MAN!

04:45.933 --> 04:47.700
WE'RE GOING TO
NEW ORLEANS!

04:47.767 --> 04:49.567
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I'LL COME WITH, TOO.

04:49.633 --> 04:51.400
THE DAUTERIVES
ARE FROM LOUISIANA.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.900
I LIVED IN THE BAYOU
TILL I WAS SIX YEARS OLD!

04:53.967 --> 04:55.633
MY AUNT ESME STILL LIVES THERE.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.300
YOU THINK WE CAN LOOK HER UP?

04:57.367 --> 05:00.133
UH, DANG IT, I KNOW WE CAN.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.300
I PLANNED OUT THE ROUTE
TO NEW ORLEANS VERY CAREFULLY.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.433
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME
FOR A SIDE TRIP.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.800
BILL, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GREW UP IN CAJUN COUNTRY

05:09.867 --> 05:11.367
AND I DON'T CARE.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.233
HMM.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.467
AND HOW IS MY MAN
WITH THE GOLDEN ARM?

05:26.533 --> 05:29.500
CALL THE BANK, MAKE SURE
THEY HAVE ROOM IN OUR ACCOUNT

05:29.567 --> 05:31.233
FOR $1 MILLION.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.400
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
FOR IT?!

05:33.467 --> 05:35.067
OH, HANK!

05:35.100 --> 05:36.100
YEAH.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.933
WELL, I MADE 42 OUT OF 50.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.400
WOULD HAVE MADE 43

05:39.467 --> 05:42.167
BUT I USED A THROW
TO DROP A BLUE JAY AT 20 FEET

05:42.233 --> 05:44.267
BEFORE HE COULD POOP
ON YOUR CAR.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.300
YOU'RE THAT GOOD?

05:45.367 --> 05:46.600
MM-HMM.

05:46.667 --> 05:49.633
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
MY AIM IS DEADLY.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.800
( laughing )

05:50.867 --> 05:53.100
THAT BLUE JAY'S FINE,
THOUGH.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.867
( speaking Creole )

06:01.600 --> 06:02.867
( speaking Creole )

06:02.933 --> 06:04.200
( laughing )

06:04.267 --> 06:06.467
THEY'RE SPEAKING
SOME KIND OF FRENCH.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.833
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.967
I SPEAK SPANISH--
IT'S THE SAME THING.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.567
HEY, SENOR.

06:12.633 --> 06:17.633
( stilted pronunciation):
DIGAME LA DIRECCIONES A LA
CASA DE LOS DAUTERIVES, POR
FAVOR.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.867
( whispering ):
HE WANTS A TIP.

06:19.933 --> 06:21.133
JE M'APPEL...

06:21.200 --> 06:23.700
( speaking Creole )

06:26.533 --> 06:28.133
Peggy:
BILL, I HAD NO IDEA

06:28.200 --> 06:29.533
THAT YOU SPOKE CAJUN.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.367
PERHAPS THAT'S
BECAUSE I...

06:31.433 --> 06:33.433
I TRY NOT TO ASK YOU
QUESTIONS.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.100
WELL, I HAD NO IDEA,
EITHER.

06:35.167 --> 06:38.533
VOILA! ICI! ICI!

06:38.600 --> 06:41.067
Hank:
GOOD LORD,

06:41.067 --> 06:44.133
YOUR FAMILY LIVED

06:44.200 --> 06:45.200
NOPE.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.900

07:30.900 --> 07:32.933
I AM LILY,
THE YOUNGEST-LOOKING.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.267
( muttering )

07:34.333 --> 07:35.367
YOU'RE TERRIBLE.

07:35.433 --> 07:37.167
I AM VIOLETTA,
THE PRETTY ONE.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.633
YOU ARE A GARDEN

07:39.700 --> 07:41.067
AND YOU ARE
THE WILLIAM

07:41.133 --> 07:42.700

SO MUCH ABOUT--

07:42.767 --> 07:45.600
THE LAST REMAINING
DAUTERIVE MALE,
OR SHOULD I SAY...

07:45.667 --> 07:47.233
OH, DON'T BOTHER.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.167
OH!

07:54.233 --> 07:56.733
( chuckling ):
YOU KIND OF SNUCK UP
ON ME THERE.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.067
OH, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.833
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CREEPER.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.300
VIOLETTA SAYS I CREEP LIKE
THE KUDZU VINES

08:03.367 --> 08:05.900
THAT ARE SLOWLY BUT SURELY
STRANGLING OUR DIXIE.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.233
UH-HUH.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.633
WHAT FASCINATING THING
ARE Y'ALL DOING?

08:09.700 --> 08:13.433
UH, I'M GOING TO BE THROWING
AT A TARGET ABOUT YEA BIG

08:13.500 --> 08:15.300
AT THE COWBOY-SAINTS GAME.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.967
IF I MAKE IT,
I WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.800
GOLDEN RICHARDS
WAS A DALLAS COWBOY.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.933
YEAH, YEAH, HE CAUGHT
A TOUCHDOWN PASS

08:23.067 --> 08:24.067
IN SUPER BOWL XXII.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.333
HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAN.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.067
I KNEW HIM... BRIEFLY.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.067
UH-HUH...

08:32.500 --> 08:36.100
MY HUSBAND
ALPHONSE DAUTERIVE--

08:36.167 --> 08:38.299
WILLIAM'S UNCLE
BY BLOOD.

08:38.366 --> 08:39.900
WHEN DID HE PASS?

08:39.967 --> 08:43.600
OH, HE LINGERS IN A ROOM
IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

08:43.667 --> 08:46.067
HANGING ON BY
THE THREAD OF A HOPE

08:46.067 --> 08:47.767
HE'LL SEE THE DAUTERIVE NAME

08:47.833 --> 08:50.767
PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
GENERATION.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.500
DOES WILLIAM HAVE
ANY SONS?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.367
NOPE. BILL IS
UNHAPPILY DIVORCED
AND WITHOUT CHILD.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.433
( sighing )

08:57.500 --> 08:58.933
PITY.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.967
THE DAUTERIVE BLOOD
IS DOWN TO A TRICKLE.

09:02.067 --> 09:06.067
MY TWO SONS AND MY SON-IN-LAW
GIRAC, RENE AND EMERIL

09:06.100 --> 09:09.233
DIED OF ARTERIAL SCLEROSIS
IN THEIR 20s

09:09.300 --> 09:12.833
LEAVING THREE DESPERATE,
CHILDLESS WIDOWS

09:12.900 --> 09:15.167
TO WANDER THIS HOUSE.

09:15.233 --> 09:20.733
THEY ARE STRINGS ON A HARP
STRETCHED FAR TOO TAUT.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.700
IF THEY ARE NOT
STRUMMED SOON...

09:23.767 --> 09:26.067
( chuckling )

09:26.100 --> 09:30.067
WELL, THEY REALLY
NEED TO BE STRUMMED.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.400
THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF
SHAKESPEARE.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.867
THIS IS MY HUSBAND
GIRAC.

09:34.933 --> 09:37.233
THE LOUISIANA DIET
WILL KILL A MAN

09:37.300 --> 09:38.767
AS SURELY AS A SWORD.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.433
UH-HUH. SO, ROSE,
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED?

09:41.500 --> 09:44.500
I'M ALL ALONE
IN THIS WORLD, WILLIAM.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.267
( speaking French )

09:51.367 --> 09:52.700
( gasping )

09:55.700 --> 09:58.067
ROSE? ROSE!

09:58.133 --> 09:59.367
( triangle playing )

09:59.433 --> 10:01.200
OH, HELLO, LILY.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.700
THAT WAS PRETTY!

10:02.767 --> 10:05.667
NOW, WAS THAT A SONG,
OR IS IT SUPPERTIME?

10:05.733 --> 10:07.233
( sighing )

10:07.300 --> 10:10.367
MY LATE HUSBAND RENE AND I
USED TO MAKE MUSIC TOGETHER.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.900
NOW THEY'RE ONLY...
NOTES.

10:14.467 --> 10:18.067
( playing French
cabaret melody )

10:18.133 --> 10:21.233
OH, YOU PLAY BEAUTIFULLY.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.167
I'M SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.633
( gasping )

10:33.700 --> 10:36.033
( wheezing )

10:36.100 --> 10:38.100
ROBERT, A YOUNG
GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU

10:38.167 --> 10:40.533
SHOULD DRESS
FOR DINNER.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.200
WELL, LET'S JUST POKE AROUND
MY OLD CHIFFOROBE

10:43.267 --> 10:45.567
AND FIND YOU SOMETHING SUITABLE.

10:45.633 --> 10:50.500
MY LORD, THIS MUGGY NOVEMBER
WEATHER GIVES ME THE HORRIBLES.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.867
ROBERT, THIS HERE IS VELVET,
NOT VELVETEEN.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.200
A GENTLEMAN MUST LEARN
THE DIFFERENCE.

10:56.267 --> 10:58.967
( Cajun accent ):
MY LORD!

10:59.033 --> 11:03.067
Gilbert:
DINNER, LIKE YOUTH,
WILL BE SERVED.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.233
YO.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.533

LET ME SIT NEXT TO GILBERT

11:25.233 --> 11:28.267

SO, UH, GILBERT...

11:29.833 --> 11:32.833

LOOK THIS YEAR, HUH?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.433
( laughing )

11:34.500 --> 11:37.467
I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH SINNERS
THAN SAINTS, MY DEAR

11:37.533 --> 11:40.100
AND SINNERS ALWAYS LOOK GOOD.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.667
( chuckling )

11:43.333 --> 11:45.533
( playing
sprightly tune )

11:57.767 --> 11:58.800
( Hank sighs )

11:58.867 --> 12:00.067
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.900
HONEY, YOU NEED
TO TRY AND RELAX

12:01.967 --> 12:03.233
BEFORE YOUR BIG THROW.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.900
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SURE

12:04.967 --> 12:07.233
BEING A MILLIONAIRE
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.400
BOBBY'S ONLY BEEN
AROUND RICH PEOPLE

12:09.467 --> 12:11.567
FOR A FEW HOURS
AND HE ALREADY LOOKS

12:11.633 --> 12:13.400
LIKE THAT KID
ON THE PAINT CAN.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.733
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT,
ISN'T THERE?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.067
( sighs )

12:17.133 --> 12:19.233
THIS PLACE, IT...
IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.733
EVERYTHING'S UPSIDE-DOWN.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.067
BILL'S GETTING WOMEN
AND BOBBY, WELL...

12:23.067 --> 12:24.800
I MISSED A BUNCH
OF THROWS TODAY

12:24.867 --> 12:26.133
AND I'M JUST THINKING--

12:26.200 --> 12:28.433
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET
TO THE SUPERDOME

12:28.500 --> 12:30.233
WITH ALL THOSE FANS WATCHING?

12:30.300 --> 12:33.733
DON'T YOU THINK DON MEREDITH
MISSED A FEW PASSES IN PRACTICE?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.600
BUT WHEN THE GAME
WAS ON THE LINE

12:35.667 --> 12:37.267
HE PUT IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY

12:37.333 --> 12:40.233
TO "BULLET" BOB HAYES
AND LANCE "NO PANTS" RENTZEL.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.433
SEE, THAT'S JUST IT.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.867
HE'S THE QUARTERBACK.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.467
I BET IF THE CONTEST
WAS ABOUT SELLING PROPANE

12:45.533 --> 12:46.567
HE'D LET ME DO IT.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.700
YOU CAN DO THIS.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.533
THEN, AFTER WE
GET BACK TO ARLEN

12:49.600 --> 12:51.267
WE'LL PUT THE
MILLION DOLLARS

12:51.333 --> 12:53.600
IN A TRUST FUND SO
IT WON'T RUIN BOBBY

12:53.667 --> 12:55.100
TILL AFTER WE'RE DEAD.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.400
( sighs )

12:57.467 --> 12:59.400
I HATE ZYDECO.

12:59.467 --> 13:01.067
WHERE'S YOUR
BAG, BILL?

13:01.133 --> 13:03.333
I'VE DECIDED TO STAY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.267
BILL, THOSE WOMEN ARE
TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.467
YOU THINK SO, TOO?

13:07.533 --> 13:09.333
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS JUST ME.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.600
LISTEN TO ME.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.833
TWO OF THESE WOMEN

13:11.900 --> 13:14.067
ARE WIDOWS
OF THE DEAD DAUTERIVE SONS.

13:14.067 --> 13:17.267
THEY'RE ONLY RELATED BY
MARRIAGE, SO THEY ARE IN PLAY

13:17.333 --> 13:20.133
BUT ONE OF THEM IS
YOUR FLESH-AND-BLOOD COUSIN.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.833
SHE IS YOUR TICKET TO HELL.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.100
OH, MY GOD.
WHICH ONE IS MY COUSIN?

13:25.167 --> 13:26.600
THAT I DO NOT KNOW

13:26.667 --> 13:30.100
SO JUST TO BE SAFE,
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ALL THREE.

13:30.167 --> 13:33.800
I STILL HAVE
A TWO-OUT-OF-THREE CHANCE.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.433
I NEVER HAD THOSE ODDS.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.600
BILL, IF YOU THINK...

13:36.667 --> 13:37.533
GOOD-BYE, PEGGY.

13:42.367 --> 13:46.300
WELL, I NEED A WINDOW SEAT
BECAUSE THIS FLOWER IS WILTIN'.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.533
OH, LORD.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.267
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE
IN THE CAR NOW.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.800
GO. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.300
HAVE A PLEASANT JOURNEY

13:52.367 --> 13:54.767
AND DON'T BE AFRAID
TO ASK DIRECTIONS

13:54.833 --> 13:56.767
FROM SOMEONE WHO
HAS ALREADY BEEN

13:56.833 --> 13:58.633
WHERE YOU THINK
YOU NEED TO GO.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.467
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:00.533 --> 14:03.233
LET "DANDY" DON MEREDITH
TAKE THE THROW.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.300
( sighs )

14:18.967 --> 14:20.633
HANK, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

14:20.700 --> 14:21.933
DON MEREDITH.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.700
SO, YOU MUST
BE HANK HILL.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.700
OH... HUH. MR. MEREDITH,
I HAVE ADMIRED YOU

14:26.767 --> 14:30.233
FROM YOUR PLAYING DAYS
TO MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL

14:30.300 --> 14:32.433
TO YOUR ICED TEA COMMERCIALS.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.933
WELL, MY MOM ALWAYS CALLS
ME "DON" OR "DONNY."

14:36.067 --> 14:39.067
WOW, THAT'S A GREAT STORY,
MR. MEREDITH.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.600
UH, SIR, THIS
IS MY WIFE, PEGGY.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.900
IF YOU WERE A WOMAN,
I BELIEVE MY HUSBAND

14:43.967 --> 14:45.967
WOULD HAVE MARRIED
YOU INSTEAD OF ME.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.267
( chuckles )

14:47.333 --> 14:48.900
FUNNY HOW
LIFE WORKS OUT.

14:48.967 --> 14:51.133
WELL, WHO'S THIS LITTLE
FUTURE NOSE GUARD?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.333
LOOK, DON...

14:52.400 --> 14:53.667
I'M A DANDY, TOO.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.567
WHY, YOU SURE
ARE, LITTLE SPORT.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.700
( awkward chuckle )

14:56.767 --> 14:57.700
YEAH.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.233
HEY, THAT
REMINDS ME, DON

14:59.300 --> 15:01.167
I'VE GOT YOUR
OLD JERSEY FOR YOU

15:01.233 --> 15:02.767
TO WEAR
DURING THE CONTEST.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.233
( whistles )

15:04.300 --> 15:07.100
YEAH, NAH, I HUNG
THAT THING UP A LONG TIME AGO.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.300
WHY DON'T YOU LET MY FRIEND
HANK, HERE, WEAR IT?

15:09.367 --> 15:10.900
OH, I WOULD
BE HONORED.

15:10.967 --> 15:13.333
YOU GOT THE PANTS, TOO?
YEAH.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.900
COWBOY METALLIC BLUE.

15:14.967 --> 15:16.100
( chuckles )

15:16.167 --> 15:18.100
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.733
THERE YOU GO, SPORT.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.700
( startled yell )

15:27.767 --> 15:29.700
OH, ROSE.

15:29.767 --> 15:32.833
I WAS JUST TIDYING UP
YOUR HUSBAND'S GRAVE.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.167
OH, YOU ARE
A SWEET, SWEET MAN.

15:36.233 --> 15:37.700
Bill:
D... A...

15:37.767 --> 15:38.867
DAUTERIVE!

15:38.933 --> 15:40.433
YOUR HUSBAND
IS A DAUTERIVE!

15:40.500 --> 15:41.633
AND HE'S DEAD.

15:41.700 --> 15:42.633
TAKE ME.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.300
OKAY.

15:44.367 --> 15:47.067
( both moaning )

15:52.633 --> 15:55.933
NOW'S THE TIME TO FAKE
AN INJURY IF YOU WANT TO.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.200
IT'S HALFTIME, HANK.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.400
WE'RE ON.

16:15.767 --> 16:20.633
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE ALAMO
BEER MILLION-DOLLAR THROW.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.967
ALAMO BEER WOULD LIKE
TO WELCOME OUR CONTEST WINNER

16:24.067 --> 16:26.967
HANK HILL,
FROM ARLEN, TEXAS

16:27.067 --> 16:31.300
AND DALLAS COWBOY LEGEND,
"DANDY" DON MEREDITH.

16:31.367 --> 16:32.900
( crowd cheering )

16:32.967 --> 16:34.267
WHAT'S IT GOING
TO BE, HANK?

16:34.333 --> 16:36.067
ARE YOU GOING TO GO
FOR THE MILLION

16:36.100 --> 16:37.900
OR ARE YOU
GOING TO LET

16:37.967 --> 16:40.667
"DANDY" DON TRY IT
FOR $100,000?

16:57.367 --> 16:58.933
DON'T WORRY, PEGGY.

16:59.067 --> 17:01.433
OUR BOY'S GOING TO COLLEGE.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.633
I'M GOING TO TAKE
THE SURE THING.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.900
A-AREN'T YOU GOING
TO TAKE OFF YOUR JACKET?

17:09.967 --> 17:11.099
( coughs )

17:15.267 --> 17:17.500
( crowd groans )

17:17.567 --> 17:19.200
TOUGH BREAK, SON.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.900
HOW ABOUT A NICE HAND
FOR "DANDY" DON MEREDITH.

17:21.967 --> 17:24.333
HE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE
OFF HIS JACKET.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.633
I WANT A DO-OVER.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.900
I COULD HAVE MADE THAT THROW.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.200
HEY!

17:29.267 --> 17:30.633
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:30.700 --> 17:32.700
YOU OWE MY SON
A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.067
HEY, YOU,
GET BACK HERE.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.400
( crowd groans )

17:39.067 --> 17:40.333
ROSE?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.467
UH-UH. IT IS
I, VIOLETTA.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.567
OH, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

17:44.633 --> 17:46.767
CAN I ASK
YOU SOMETHING?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.533
THE ANSWER IS YES.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.767
YEAH, I KNOW

17:49.833 --> 17:51.567
BUT YOUR FIRST HUSBAND--

17:51.633 --> 17:54.467
WHAT IS THE NAME
ON HIS FINAL RESTING CRYPT?

17:54.533 --> 17:55.667
ANSWER HIM,
VIOLETTA.

17:55.733 --> 17:56.867
LILY, BEGONE!

17:56.933 --> 17:57.900
HI, LILY.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.433
THIS IS WRONG--
VIOLETTA IS

17:59.500 --> 18:01.200
YOUR BLOOD
COUSIN, GUILLAUME.

18:01.267 --> 18:02.400
SHE'S LYING.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.267
I'M NOT YOUR COUSIN--
SHE IS.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.500
YOU ARE THE LIAR.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.633
♪ WILLIAM. ♪

18:06.700 --> 18:08.633
ROSE?

18:08.700 --> 18:12.067
WE ARE NOT ALONE.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.267
YES, I KNOW.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.100
SHE IS YOUR COUSIN.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.167
NO, SHE IS.
NO, SHE IS.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.667
( women shrieking )

18:24.767 --> 18:25.933
( startled yell )

18:26.067 --> 18:26.933
GILBERT?

18:27.067 --> 18:29.267
YOUR COUSIN
IS VIOLETTA.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.067
( feline hissing )

18:32.433 --> 18:34.700
NOW, HOW LONG
YOU BEEN SITTING THERE?

18:34.767 --> 18:38.900
35 YEARS.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.167
I WAS THE QUARTERBACK

18:40.233 --> 18:42.367
AND I HAD A CLEAR
PATH TO THE END ZONE

18:42.433 --> 18:44.067
BUT INSTEAD,
I HANDED IT OFF

18:44.100 --> 18:47.433
TO A GUY IN A FUZZY COAT WHO
THREW IT LIKE A PLACE KICKER.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.300
I DO BELIEVE I'LL
GIVE ROOM SERVICE

18:50.367 --> 18:54.100
A JANGLE AND HAVE THEM
SEND UP SOME ETOUFFE.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.700
Bobby:
NO!

19:07.300 --> 19:08.367
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

19:08.433 --> 19:09.367
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:09.433 --> 19:10.367
AN APOLOGY.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.067
HUH. YOU'RE THE ONE

19:12.100 --> 19:13.833
WHO BLINDSIDED A QUARTERBACK
AT THE KNEES, HOSS.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.667
UH, WELL, YEAH, I GUESS

19:15.733 --> 19:18.167
THAT WAS UNSPORTSMAN-LIKE
CONDUCT.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.500
I'M SORRY.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.700
BUT STILL, WELL...
HERE'S MY POINT.

19:21.767 --> 19:24.067
I WOULD HAVE MADE THAT THROW.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.700
UH-HUH. IF "IF" AND "BUTS"
WERE CANDY AND NUTS

19:26.767 --> 19:28.600
WE'D ALL HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.600
I WOULD HAVE.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.367
ALL RIGHT, HOSS.
PROVE IT.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.600
TAKE US
TO THE SUPERDOME, CABBY.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.233
VIOLETTA TELLS ME
SHE DISCOVERED YOU

19:36.300 --> 19:39.600
IN A COMPROMISING
POSITION WITH ROSE AND LILY.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.100
TELL ME THIS.

19:41.167 --> 19:45.367
WERE YOU HERE TO TILL THE SOIL
AND NURTURE THE VINE

19:45.433 --> 19:48.900
OR WERE YOU JUST PLAYING
IN THE GARDEN?

19:48.967 --> 19:50.900
PLAYING.

19:50.967 --> 19:55.567
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST
IF YOU TOOK YOUR LEAVE.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.600
CAN I SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE GIRLS?

19:58.667 --> 20:00.100
TEN YARDS...

20:00.167 --> 20:01.433
ONE SHOT.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.367
CONGRATULATIONS, SON.

20:13.433 --> 20:14.900
YOU FEEL BETTER?

20:16.433 --> 20:18.167
NO. IT'S NOT THE SAME.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.567
THERE'S NO FANS
IN THE STANDS.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.833
THERE'S NO PRESSURE

20:21.900 --> 20:23.800
AND I DIDN'T WIN
A MILLION DOLLARS.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.800
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, HANK.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.933
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY...
IS GONE.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.133
MAYBE YOU WOULD
HAVE MADE THAT THROW

20:30.200 --> 20:31.267
BUT YOU PICKED ME.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.333
YEAH, I PICKED YOU

20:32.400 --> 20:33.633
BUT I THOUGHT AT LEAST

20:33.700 --> 20:35.800
YOU WOULD HAVE
TAKEN OFF YOUR JACKET.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.500
HANK, I PRACTICED THAT
THROW ALL WEEK AT HOME.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.933
I EVEN MADE A TEN-FOOT TALL
REPLICA OF THE ALAMO BEER CAN.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.233
IT GETS COLD IN NEW MEXICO
THIS TIME OF YEAR

20:44.300 --> 20:45.633
SO I WORE MY COAT.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.433
I WASN'T GOING
TO CHANGE THAT YESTERDAY.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.833
I DIDN'T WANT TO SCREW UP
MY THROWING MOTION.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.033
HUH.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.367
WELL, HAD I KNOWN THAT

20:52.433 --> 20:54.267
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE TACKLED YOU.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.933
DAMNED IF I DIDN'T WANT
TO COME THROUGH FOR YOU.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.267
I'M SORRY I LET YOU DOWN

20:58.333 --> 20:59.767
BUT YOU'LL BE
A LOT HAPPIER

20:59.833 --> 21:01.433
IF YOU LET
THIS ONE GO, HANK.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.767
I'LL NEVER
HAVE A CHANCE

21:02.833 --> 21:03.967
LIKE THIS AGAIN.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.300
NOPE. YOU WON'T.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.833
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
SOMETHING I WANTED

21:06.900 --> 21:09.167
AS MUCH AS YOU WANTED
THAT MILLION DOLLARS.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.967
DON, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

21:11.067 --> 21:14.067
YOU WERE A COWBOY...
DURING THE LANDRY YEARS.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.067
I WANTED TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.233
CAME CLOSE,
BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.300
NEVER WILL,
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

21:20.367 --> 21:21.900
I'VE NEVER LOOKED BACK.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.233

YOU KNOW, I BUILT A TEN-FOOT
ALAMO BEER CAN, TOO.

THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO GO, HOSS.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.167
NICE WEEKEND, BILL?

21:48.233 --> 21:49.967
