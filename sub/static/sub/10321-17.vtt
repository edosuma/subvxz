11:23.951 --> 11:26.219
It made perfect sense.

11:26.253 --> 11:30.323
My whole life, the government
only paid attention to me when
they thought I was being bad.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.794
So I had no choice.
I was gonna be bad.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.131
We knew from experience
that it was windy at the top.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.300
So we came prepared.

Now what?
We just wait to get caught.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.377

You wanna wrestle?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.758
Seems kind of dangerous
all the way up here.

open your eyes.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.384
There's no water in
the water tower. Why don't
they just call it a tower?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.553
I can't believe
we fell through the roof.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.322
They should put a sign
out front warning people.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.859
Earl, what are we gonna do?

13:11.892 --> 13:15.262
Don't worry. Someone
will notice our car
and come lookin' for us.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.113
Okay, Randy.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.849
I'm gonna
climb my own rope
all the way to the top.

13:35.883 --> 13:39.152
Once I'm secure up there,
I'm gonna tie my rope off,

Too bad Coach Gebhardt isn't
here to call you a girl and
throw basketballs at your face.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.173
That'd get you up there.

Hey. I got two candy bars
in my pocket.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.052

Why'd you drop it?

Because you didn't tell me
you were gonna throw it.

I'm sorry.

It's my fault the jumping broke
the roof. It's 'cause I don't
bend my knees when I land.

That's what
the dance teacher who came to
football practice told me.

I'm not mad at you, Randy.
I'm mad at the government.

Hello. You guys
all right down there?

[ Earl Narrating ] It turned out
the government had been busy
doing something for us.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.435
We just didn't know it.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.807
Willie the mailman brought Joy
a letter saying our car
was towed to the impound yard.

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

17:58.778 --> 18:04.151

came to the motel to yell at me
for not changing my address yet,

18:04.184 --> 18:06.619
Catalina saw that our car
had been impounded.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.821
She got worried because
she hadn't seen us for days.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.093
So she reported it
to a policeman.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.565
He had to file
a missing persons report,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.300
then went down
to the impound yard
to investigate.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.673
When the police
found out where our car
had been towed from,

18:26.706 --> 18:29.642
they got suspicious
and called a city worker
to come unlock the gate.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.646

18:35.815 --> 18:39.452
And when the city worker
saw me and Randy's ropes
tied to the top of the tower,

18:39.486 --> 18:41.388
they called
the fire department for help.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.857
And that's when I realized...

18:44.891 --> 18:48.295
maybe the government
doesn't always just see people
as bad or good.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.664
Sometimes it just
sees people who need help.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.767
And even if you don't
see the government
workin' for you every day,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.870

working for somebody.

was me and Randy.

it cost the government
$4,000 to rescue me,

another check on the spot,

is free to taxpayers.
