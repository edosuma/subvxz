WEBVTT

00:01.992 --> 00:03.292
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:03.294 --> 00:04.127
- Class ranking?

00:04.129 --> 00:05.261
Jenna, where are you?

00:05.263 --> 00:06.062
- T, I am 137.

00:06.064 --> 00:08.731
So Matty had completely
replaced me in his life.

00:08.733 --> 00:09.932
- Stop moping over Matty.

00:09.934 --> 00:12.268
- Did you get another phone?
- This one's Autumn's.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.736
- Who's Autumn?
- Autumn San Diego.

00:13.738 --> 00:16.239
The online persona I created
to catfish Jake.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.475
- It was my first college
overnight visit,

00:19.477 --> 00:20.810
and I had reinvention
on my mind.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.012
College was the end
of Jenna Hamilton, that girl,

00:23.014 --> 00:25.314
and the birth
of Jenna Hamilton, it girl.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.584
I could see myself now,
attending literary events,

00:28.586 --> 00:30.653
talking books with cute boys,

00:30.655 --> 00:31.788
bantering over coffee.

00:31.790 --> 00:34.557
But first, I had to
ace my interview and get in.

00:34.559 --> 00:36.859
- Man, this place is
full of memories--

00:36.861 --> 00:40.463
kegs and eggs,
frisbee games in the quad,

00:40.465 --> 00:42.965
chili-cheese monster burgers.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.467
Best four years of my life...

00:44.469 --> 00:48.504
Except for every year
that I've spent with you.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.238
- Uh-huh.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.640
- Okay, what time
is your interview?

00:50.642 --> 00:51.541
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

00:51.543 --> 00:52.709
- Ding! Ding!
Correct.

00:52.711 --> 00:53.543
Mine's at 9:00.

00:53.545 --> 00:54.610
So we'll wake up at 8:00,

00:54.612 --> 00:56.512
do one last run through
our answers,

00:56.514 --> 00:57.246
get Max caffed,

00:57.248 --> 00:58.381
and show up ten minutes early

00:58.383 --> 00:59.749
to show that we have minds
for business

00:59.751 --> 01:01.284
even if we also have bods
for sin.

01:01.286 --> 01:02.251
- "Bods"?
- Jenna.

01:02.253 --> 01:03.920
Now is no time
for distraction action.

01:03.922 --> 01:05.021
Ask me one of the questions.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.390
- "What do you think
you can bring to the school?"

01:07.392 --> 01:09.292
- Talent, ambition,
mindfulness,

01:09.294 --> 01:12.095
ability, reflection,
and acronyms.

01:12.097 --> 01:13.229
Tamara.

01:13.231 --> 01:14.063
What about you?

01:14.065 --> 01:15.565
- I think my writing skills
would be an asset,

01:15.567 --> 01:17.100
as well as my
leadership qualities--

01:17.102 --> 01:18.367
- ugh, they snooze,
you lose,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.436
and that answer may as well
have been an Ambien.

01:20.438 --> 01:21.838
You need to get
your [bleep] together.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.272
If we don't get
into the same college,

01:23.274 --> 01:24.340
we can't be roommates,

01:24.342 --> 01:25.708
and then it's
the end of Jennara,

01:25.710 --> 01:27.110
and then it is
murder-suicide time,

01:27.112 --> 01:30.146
and you know I'm gonna have to
do all the work on that one.

01:30.148 --> 01:31.314
- Oh, Lace, look.

01:31.316 --> 01:32.815
Over there, we had this party

01:32.817 --> 01:35.585
Columbus day weekend
sophomore year.

01:35.587 --> 01:36.452
It got crazy.

01:36.454 --> 01:39.722
- "O" to the "M"
to the "F" to the "G."

01:39.724 --> 01:41.390
This place is like
a pinterest board

01:41.392 --> 01:44.861
full of bangable dudes
just come to life.

01:44.863 --> 01:47.497
Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin.

01:47.499 --> 01:49.398
- Now who's succumbing
to distraction action?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.401
- You're right.
We need to go horsey style.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.303
Focus on the task at hand.

01:54.305 --> 01:55.138
Come on.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.005
- Not so fast.

01:56.007 --> 01:59.308
I brought a special gift
to help you fit in, huh?

01:59.310 --> 02:01.177
Now you'll be the spitting image
of your old man.

02:01.179 --> 02:03.379
- I'm not sure
that's a good thing.

02:03.381 --> 02:04.046
- Great.

02:04.048 --> 02:05.481
I'd gone from
hot incoming freshman

02:05.483 --> 02:08.651
to large-sized linebacker
in 10 seconds flat.

02:10.254 --> 02:12.955
This was the hottest guy
I'd ever seen.

02:12.957 --> 02:14.891
He made young
Leonardo DiCaprio

02:14.893 --> 02:17.426
look like
old Leonardo DiCaprio.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.161
- Pin.

02:18.163 --> 02:20.763
Pin, pin, pin, pin, pin,
pin, pin, pin, pin.

02:20.765 --> 02:24.867
- Hey, want to go
to a party tonight?

02:26.670 --> 02:29.238
- Sorry.
Invite only.

02:33.343 --> 02:36.679
[Keys clacking, thud]

02:36.681 --> 02:37.914
- It's not that I don't love

02:37.916 --> 02:39.482
hearing you sing off-key
to Imagine Dragons,

02:39.484 --> 02:42.385
but any idea when you're gonna
have your car again?

02:42.387 --> 02:45.288
- ♪ Probably two months
from never ♪

02:45.290 --> 02:48.524
my parents are so pissed
I totaled my car.

02:48.526 --> 02:50.660
- Yeah, it was pretty
stupid of us.

02:50.662 --> 02:53.896
- We were having fun, man.
[bleep] them.

02:53.898 --> 02:54.931
- [Laughs]

02:54.933 --> 02:56.199
Dude, what is your deal?

02:56.201 --> 02:58.234
Every day, you're, like,
two seconds away

02:58.236 --> 02:59.869
from going beast mode.

02:59.871 --> 03:02.305
- Nothing.

03:02.739 --> 03:04.473
- Matthew, what's wrong?

03:04.475 --> 03:07.443
- What is that,
your Oprah face?

03:09.379 --> 03:12.582
- Ugh.
All right, fine.

03:12.584 --> 03:13.416
I'm--

03:13.418 --> 03:16.953
[cell phone vibrates]
- Hold that thought.

03:16.955 --> 03:18.387
Oh, sorry.
I thought it might be Autumn.

03:18.389 --> 03:20.423
We've been texting each other
every day.

03:20.425 --> 03:21.524
She's really cool.

03:21.526 --> 03:22.525
- Look at these classes--

03:22.527 --> 03:23.893
"Women's Studies 113.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.761
"From Cleopatra
to Angelina Jolie.

03:25.763 --> 03:27.530
Power bitches through the ages."

03:27.532 --> 03:28.831
This is the perfect school
for me.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.367
- While Tamara was obsessing
about the course catalog,

03:31.369 --> 03:32.668
I was cataloguing
my insecurities.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.005
This place seemed awesome,
but could I really get in?

03:36.007 --> 03:37.306
- Okay, next stop on our tour.

03:37.308 --> 03:38.875
- Every time one of my bros
passed a final,

03:38.877 --> 03:42.378
we'd streak through this quad
and then jump in that fountain.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.847
I puked in those bushes
and those ones...

03:44.849 --> 03:47.650
Oh, and those ones right there--
- we get it, Kevin.

03:47.652 --> 03:48.985
You went to college.

03:48.987 --> 03:51.420
- On our right,
we have the English department.

03:51.422 --> 03:53.289
Do we have any writers
in the group?

03:53.291 --> 03:54.824
Cool.
What do you like to write?

03:54.826 --> 03:57.793
- Oh, I'm not the writer,
but my daughter is.

03:57.795 --> 03:58.661
I know, I know.

03:58.663 --> 04:01.197
How can I be old enough
to have a 17-year-old?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.531
But I was young and dumb,

04:02.533 --> 04:05.968
and you know it just takes
one time without a condom.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.403
- Okay.

04:07.405 --> 04:08.738
Well...

04:08.740 --> 04:10.373
- Jenna.
- Jenna.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.674
A lot of great writers
have gone here.

04:11.676 --> 04:13.276
Who are your favorite authors?

04:13.278 --> 04:14.310
- I know this.

04:14.312 --> 04:15.211
I know this.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.145
I'm a writer.

04:16.147 --> 04:17.380
Of course I know
my favorite authors.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.948
So why was Garfield
the only word I could think of?

04:18.950 --> 04:21.083
He's not even an author.
He's a cat.

04:21.085 --> 04:21.817
Oh, God.

04:21.819 --> 04:24.587
- Of course, writers
are always the silent type.

04:24.589 --> 04:27.323
Straight ahead,
you'll see the student union.

04:27.325 --> 04:29.125
- You're going to get
through this.

04:29.127 --> 04:32.094
I called you in here
because I'm concerned.

04:32.096 --> 04:33.162
You've been distant.

04:33.164 --> 04:35.965
You're skipping school.
You quit your job.

04:35.967 --> 04:38.134
I've seen these signs before.

04:38.136 --> 04:39.702
You don't know who you are.

04:39.704 --> 04:41.504
You're questioning everything

04:41.506 --> 04:44.941
you thought you knew
about yourself.

04:44.943 --> 04:46.609
You're gay.

04:46.611 --> 04:47.810
- What?

04:47.812 --> 04:49.812
No. No, I'm not.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

04:49.814 --> 04:51.080
You don't have to pretend.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.183
I mean, why else would you work
at Preston & Boone?

04:54.185 --> 04:55.451
- That was just a job.

04:55.453 --> 04:57.820
- Okay, and <i>2 boys, 1 butt</i>
is just a movie.

04:57.822 --> 04:59.755
Look, it gets better.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.024
This is an amazing time
to be gay.

05:02.026 --> 05:04.593
Just look at that Ellen lady.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.428
Just be careful.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.830
A cupcake like you could get
eaten alive out there.

05:07.832 --> 05:09.999
- Again, uh, not gay.

05:10.001 --> 05:11.434
- Of course not.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.602
Let's talk Anderson Cooper.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.104
- Well, that's the end
of the tour.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.372
For those of you
staying overnight,

05:16.374 --> 05:18.541
your hosts are waiting
over there to meet you.

05:18.543 --> 05:19.642
- After my tour de humiliation,

05:19.644 --> 05:22.144
all I wanted to do
was never see Luke again.

05:22.146 --> 05:25.047
But if I wanted to prove myself
worthy of admission,

05:25.049 --> 05:26.449
I needed to face my fears,

05:26.451 --> 05:29.518
even if I did need
a boost of confidence first.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.522
It was time to break the ice.

05:33.524 --> 05:34.523
Luke...

05:34.525 --> 05:36.392
William Faulkner, Joan Didion,

05:36.394 --> 05:37.526
and I'm not ashamed to say

05:37.528 --> 05:39.662
that I have read everything
by V.C. Andrews.

05:39.664 --> 05:40.663
- Nice high-low blend.

05:40.665 --> 05:42.598
A woman after my own heart.
- Really?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.200
I feel like you have
an entire bookshelf

05:44.202 --> 05:45.668
full of Murakami
and Martin Amis.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.269
- Sure, on the top shelf.

05:47.271 --> 05:48.404
Once you get to the bottom,

05:48.406 --> 05:49.805
there's an awful lot
of Dan Brown.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.942
- We are going to be
totally Baskin-Robbins tonight.

05:52.944 --> 05:54.510
- 31 flavors of fun?
- Duh.

05:54.512 --> 05:55.945
Oh, my God,
come to the party tonight

05:55.947 --> 05:58.714
my sorority's co-hosting
with the Lambda Delta Rho boys.

05:58.716 --> 06:00.149
The theme is tight and bright.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.550
- That's my favorite look.

06:01.552 --> 06:02.585
- I'm the president.

06:02.587 --> 06:04.453
- Oh, my God,
I'm a president too.

06:04.455 --> 06:05.588
- [Gasps]

06:05.590 --> 06:06.756
- Hey, you should stop by

06:06.758 --> 06:08.024
this fund-raiser tonight.

06:08.026 --> 06:09.025
The literacy center--

06:09.027 --> 06:11.527
my band AC/V.C. Andrews
is playing.

06:11.529 --> 06:13.429
- Can't resist a good pun.

06:13.431 --> 06:17.233
I'll try to make it.
- Do that.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.570
- Hey, shouldn't you be
at cheer practice?

06:21.572 --> 06:22.738
- Not unless I want to Ralph!

06:22.740 --> 06:26.142
Have you seen Lissa's face
when she calls out cheers?

06:26.144 --> 06:26.942
Barf city.

06:26.944 --> 06:28.711
And I can't even bone
my sorrows away,

06:28.713 --> 06:29.779
because Austin's away

06:29.781 --> 06:32.381
at some dumbass robotics
competition all weekend.

06:32.383 --> 06:34.483
Life sucks.

06:34.485 --> 06:35.584
- Tell me about it.

06:35.586 --> 06:37.520
Autumn hasn't responded
to my texts all day.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.822
Usually we're
in constant contact.

06:39.824 --> 06:41.457
This hard to get...

06:41.459 --> 06:43.692
It's driving me crazy.
- That is it.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.928
No more wallowing.
Let's do something fun tonight.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.164
My mom's out of town.
Why don't you guys come over?

06:48.166 --> 06:51.233
- I thought you were grounded.
- Who's leaving the house?

06:51.235 --> 06:52.134
- I'm in.

06:52.136 --> 06:54.203
When's the last time
the three of us hung out?

06:54.205 --> 06:56.338
- Awesome, okay.
Come over around 9:00?

06:56.340 --> 06:58.974
- You guys having a party?
I can bring the booze.

06:58.976 --> 07:00.543
I have this huge stash
of Cristal left over

07:00.545 --> 07:02.645
from when I was dating
this dumb wannabe rapper.

07:02.647 --> 07:05.381
- We can get our own alcohol.
Thanks.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.083
- No, Eva, you should come.

07:07.085 --> 07:08.951
- Really?
I don't want to intrude.

07:08.953 --> 07:11.420
- I'm so sure.
- We'd love it.

07:11.422 --> 07:13.889
- Awesome. I'll see you then.
- Okay.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.224
- Why did you do that?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.892
That girl is
a straight-up creeper.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.361
She's always
up in everyone's business.

07:19.363 --> 07:23.632
- Who's a creeper?
Who's up in everyone's business?

07:23.634 --> 07:26.001
- I know you wanted to go
to that fund-raiser,

07:26.003 --> 07:27.136
but that idea gives me a sad.

07:27.138 --> 07:28.471
Anyway, we have to
start thinking

07:28.473 --> 07:29.738
what sorority
we want to pledge,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.907
because we do not
want to be Greek geeks.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.875
- Maybe T had a point.

07:32.877 --> 07:34.443
This was our first
college party--

07:34.445 --> 07:36.779
drinking wine,
boys in blazers,

07:36.781 --> 07:38.514
smart conversations
about politics

07:38.516 --> 07:40.983
and art with a capital "A,"
and--

07:44.488 --> 07:47.256
- hey, everybody,
Edward Fortyhands!

07:47.258 --> 07:49.558
Whoo!

07:53.363 --> 07:54.897
- My dreams
of collegiate sophistication

07:54.899 --> 07:58.134
had been popped like so many
bottles of off-brand vodka,

07:58.136 --> 07:59.368
which, along with
watery beer,

07:59.370 --> 08:01.270
was all there was to drink
at this party.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.772
- But really, being a Kaps Gams
is all about traditions--

08:03.774 --> 08:07.743
you know, pancake breakfasts,
formals, matching tattoos.

08:07.745 --> 08:09.478
I mean, like,
isn't it all to die for.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.814
- Death has never sounded
so good.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.717
- Your sorority is amaze-tits.

08:14.719 --> 08:17.586
Vodka plus girl talk
plus communal closet

08:17.588 --> 08:18.521
equals happy Tamara.

08:18.523 --> 08:20.256
- Oh, my God, you have to rush
Kappa Gamma.

08:20.258 --> 08:22.958
You are, like,
the perfect sister.

08:24.594 --> 08:27.029
- I'm gonna go
to the literacy fund-raiser.

08:27.031 --> 08:27.696
- Oh.

08:27.698 --> 08:28.831
Okay, I'll come with you.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.065
- No, no, that's okay.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.700
You're having fun here.
Stay.

08:31.702 --> 08:32.801
- Are you sure?

08:32.803 --> 08:34.036
- Yes.

08:34.038 --> 08:34.904
In high school,

08:34.906 --> 08:36.772
Tamara and I were always
on the same page.

08:36.774 --> 08:39.175
Even if we get
into the same school,

08:39.177 --> 08:41.577
was this the end of Jennara?

08:41.579 --> 08:43.679
- Ooh!

08:43.681 --> 08:44.547
Pour me a shot.

08:44.549 --> 08:47.216
- Seriously,
why hasn't Autumn texted yet?

08:47.218 --> 08:48.884
Do you think
she's with another guy?

08:48.886 --> 08:51.520
- I've got to 'gram this.

08:52.122 --> 08:55.391
Anyway, that's the last time
I partied at Butter.

08:55.393 --> 08:57.660
- That was an amazing story.
- Yeah.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.528
So amazing I think it
was just actually

08:59.530 --> 09:01.397
a retold episode
of <i>Gossip Girl.</i>

09:01.399 --> 09:02.731
- That show is really
true to life.

09:02.733 --> 09:04.400
I guess if you've never
been to New York,

09:04.402 --> 09:06.135
it'd be kind of hard
to believe,

09:06.137 --> 09:10.272
but for us New Yorkers,
it actually seemed kind of tame.

09:10.274 --> 09:11.273
No, you're not tame.

09:11.275 --> 09:13.809
You're a wild man.
I can tell.

09:13.811 --> 09:15.711
- Oh, yeah?
- For sure.

09:15.713 --> 09:19.415
- Oh, yeah.
Wild old Matty McKitten.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.116
[Laughter]

09:21.118 --> 09:22.017
- McKitten.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.286
Oh, my--I totally forgot
about that.

09:24.288 --> 09:25.854
Rawr!
- [Hisses]

09:25.856 --> 09:27.189
- What's McKitten?

09:27.191 --> 09:29.024
- Inside joke.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.193
- You know what's crazy

09:31.195 --> 09:32.995
is that there's a hot tub
right there

09:32.997 --> 09:34.129
and we're not all in it.

09:34.131 --> 09:35.764
- Yes!
Hot tub.

09:35.766 --> 09:36.765
Great.
Sadie?

09:36.767 --> 09:39.835
- I would,
but I don't have my suit.

09:39.837 --> 09:41.604
- Who needs one?

09:42.639 --> 09:45.074
- Okay.

09:49.879 --> 09:51.213
- Oh, wow.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.650
- Sadie, I totally understand
if you don't feel comfortable.

09:54.652 --> 09:56.418
- Why wouldn't I?

10:02.359 --> 10:03.259
- Damn, Sadie.

10:03.261 --> 10:05.661
- That's what I love
about the South of France.

10:05.663 --> 10:06.662
Everyone's topless.

10:06.664 --> 10:10.099
They're not prudes
like Americans.

10:15.772 --> 10:18.240
Sadie, I really admire
how comfortable you are

10:18.242 --> 10:19.041
with your body.

10:19.043 --> 10:22.444
You're so brave.
- I'm not brave.

10:25.882 --> 10:27.283
I have amazing tits,

10:27.285 --> 10:31.787
unlike you
and your sad floppers.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.367
- Hey, you made it.

10:45.969 --> 10:48.737
- Wouldn't miss
AC/V.C. Andrews.

10:48.739 --> 10:49.471
- Totally.

10:49.473 --> 10:51.740
Wait. You know
that was a joke, right?

10:51.742 --> 10:53.542
- Yeah, yeah.

10:53.544 --> 10:54.843
But you're totally missing out

10:54.845 --> 10:57.079
on an opportunity for a song
called <i>For Those About to Read.</i>

10:57.081 --> 10:59.148
- <i>You Read Me All Night Long.</i>

10:59.150 --> 11:00.949
- <i>Highway to the Attic.</i>

11:00.951 --> 11:04.286
That one--
that one was a stretch.

11:07.891 --> 11:09.992
- Hey, uh,
I'll be right back.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.761
- Uh-oh. Was it my pun
that sent Luke running,

11:12.763 --> 11:15.297
or was he just distracted
by a shinier object?

11:15.299 --> 11:19.435
Ugh, were college guys
just varsity high-school boys?

11:19.437 --> 11:22.838
[Applause]

11:24.040 --> 11:26.508
- Growing up, my mom had
to work multiple jobs

11:26.510 --> 11:27.743
just to keep the lights on,

11:27.745 --> 11:29.778
and there wasn't
a lot of spare time

11:29.780 --> 11:30.913
to help me learn how to read.

11:30.915 --> 11:33.515
Programs like this helped me
learn to love books,

11:33.517 --> 11:37.052
and I am so proud
to be passing it on

11:37.054 --> 11:39.722
to the next generation,

11:39.724 --> 11:42.558
along with my love
of bad puns.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.859
- Watching Luke
speak eloquently,

11:43.861 --> 11:46.395
I couldn't believe
how sexy a speech could be.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.931
College guys weren't
varsity high-school boys.

11:48.933 --> 11:52.000
College guys were
a whole different ball game.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.636
- How was that
double monster burger?

11:54.638 --> 11:55.304
- Great.

11:55.306 --> 11:58.507
[Groans]
I think I need to lie down.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.376
- So where are we going next?

12:00.378 --> 12:03.045
That tiki bar on main street
looked fun.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.681
Ooh, maybe dancing.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.915
Hmm.

12:06.917 --> 12:09.218
Kevin.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.586
Kevin!

12:17.827 --> 12:19.828
- Oh, I got to pass.

12:19.830 --> 12:20.929
I'm in the magic zone,

12:20.931 --> 12:23.198
and I do not want to hit
hangover city--population, T.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.167
Or worse,
cruise into the yak zone.

12:25.169 --> 12:26.201
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.269
It's totally fine.

12:27.271 --> 12:30.272
The trick is to keep a tally
of how many you drink.

12:30.274 --> 12:31.640
Here.

12:34.644 --> 12:36.678
[Both giggle]

12:36.680 --> 12:37.679
Ooh, sorry.

12:37.681 --> 12:38.547
[Both gasp]

12:38.549 --> 12:40.082
Oh, my God, Mrs. Hamil--

12:40.084 --> 12:41.450
- shh!

12:46.356 --> 12:48.323
- That's the best part
about college.

12:48.325 --> 12:50.793
You get exposed
to all these cool people,

12:50.795 --> 12:54.763
like pretty girls
with killer taste in books.

12:58.735 --> 13:01.403
Do you want to get
out of here?

13:01.405 --> 13:04.373
- I absolutely do.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.743
[Drum roll]

13:07.745 --> 13:08.944
[All cheer]

13:08.946 --> 13:12.514
- We should do more shots.
- You got it.

13:12.516 --> 13:14.116
- Boop!

13:14.118 --> 13:16.318
- To new friends.

13:17.787 --> 13:19.521
Oh, party foul.

13:19.523 --> 13:20.589
- Okay.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.957
Time for bed for you.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.292
- Sadie, I can put him to bed.

13:23.294 --> 13:25.260
- I'm sure
you'd love the chance,

13:25.262 --> 13:27.062
but you've done enough.

13:27.064 --> 13:29.598
Come on, Matty.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.967
- All right.

13:32.635 --> 13:37.339
- It's just a little catfishing.
It's totally no big deal.

13:37.341 --> 13:39.842
Oh, my butt's buzzing.

13:43.646 --> 13:44.480
- Oh, bummer.

13:44.482 --> 13:46.381
He texted Autumn
before he texted you.

13:46.383 --> 13:47.716
- But he texted me--

13:47.718 --> 13:50.419
me, Tamara, not just Autumn.

13:50.421 --> 13:52.321
It's time to celebrate.

13:55.592 --> 13:58.227
[Both laugh]

13:58.229 --> 14:00.829
- I'll be right back
with some water.

14:00.831 --> 14:03.699
Try not to puke on yourself.

14:19.649 --> 14:22.818
- [Sighs]
Okay.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.254
Drink this.

14:25.256 --> 14:28.524
Oh, not too fast.

14:30.426 --> 14:32.694
- Sadie, you are so nice to me.

14:32.696 --> 14:35.931
You know, everyone thinks
you're so mean,

14:35.933 --> 14:38.834
and you are,
but you are so nice to me.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.403
- Okay, drunky.
- You are.

14:41.405 --> 14:45.941
You're so nice,
and you are so pretty.

14:45.943 --> 14:48.410
[Laughs]

14:48.412 --> 14:49.311
- Oh.

14:49.313 --> 14:50.412
- So pretty.

14:50.414 --> 14:53.315
Hey, why didn't
we ever hook up?

14:53.317 --> 14:57.286
- Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

14:57.288 --> 14:58.453
I tried.

14:58.455 --> 15:02.691
Don't you remember passing out
that New Year's Eve?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.826
- Oh, that was dumb.

15:04.828 --> 15:08.297
That was--
oh, that was so dumb.

15:08.299 --> 15:10.198
It was a big regret.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.801
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.803 --> 15:15.203
The biggest.

15:19.442 --> 15:22.411
- Ew!
- [Spits]

15:22.413 --> 15:24.813
It's like kissing my sister...

15:24.815 --> 15:25.614
[Both laugh]

15:25.616 --> 15:28.684
Which, for all I know,
you could be.

15:28.686 --> 15:30.085
- What?

15:31.621 --> 15:32.621
- I'm adopted.

15:32.623 --> 15:34.723
- Sure, McKibben.
- No, it gets better.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.193
My parents--
they never told me.

15:38.195 --> 15:40.629
- Oh, my God.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.497
- Yeah.

15:42.499 --> 15:44.232
- Do they know you know?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.201
- They lied to me
my whole life,

15:46.203 --> 15:51.473
so why should I tell them
the truth?

15:53.943 --> 15:56.111
It just sucks.

16:03.453 --> 16:06.088
- I know.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.390
I know.
I'm sorry.

16:08.392 --> 16:12.160
- Hey, what's a seven-letter
word for pals,

16:12.162 --> 16:13.061
starts with a "C"?

16:13.063 --> 16:14.363
- Waking up
with a high-school boy,

16:14.365 --> 16:15.964
you scramble
to pull your clothes on

16:15.966 --> 16:17.366
and get home before curfew.

16:17.368 --> 16:19.201
Waking up with a college boy,

16:19.203 --> 16:21.503
coffee and crosswords.

16:21.505 --> 16:23.005
I could get used to this.

16:23.007 --> 16:25.273
"Cronies."
- Ah.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.141
You're a genius.

16:26.143 --> 16:29.511
You're totally gonna ace
that interview.

16:29.513 --> 16:30.612
- Oh, my God.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.914
What time is it?

16:34.817 --> 16:36.485
- 8:30.

16:36.487 --> 16:37.419
- I should go.

16:37.421 --> 16:38.286
I knew the score.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.321
I didn't need to DTR,

16:39.323 --> 16:41.023
because this "D"
was already D'd.

16:41.025 --> 16:44.326
This was a one-night thing,
and that's okay.

16:44.328 --> 16:47.629
- Hey, I'm gonna be
in Palos Verdes later this week.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.364
I'd love to see you again.

16:49.366 --> 16:51.066
- I'd like that.

16:51.068 --> 16:54.503
- Then it's a date.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.341
- Okay, that last part
was a lie.

16:59.343 --> 17:02.411
This is way better.

17:02.413 --> 17:07.149
[Cell phone vibrates]

17:07.151 --> 17:10.252
- [Coughs]

17:10.254 --> 17:11.119
[Groans]

17:11.121 --> 17:13.555
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:15.358 --> 17:16.191
[Bleep]!

17:16.193 --> 17:18.727
Ow, that hurt.

17:33.276 --> 17:35.243
- Really?
Walk of shame?

17:35.245 --> 17:36.645
Aren't you a little old
for that?

17:36.647 --> 17:38.513
- [Bleep].
Listen, nothing happened.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.849
- I wasn't worried about that.
- And why is that?

17:40.851 --> 17:45.620
Because let me tell you,
I had quite a few opportunities.

17:45.622 --> 17:47.889
- Lacey,
I trust you completely.

17:47.891 --> 17:49.524
I'm just...

17:49.959 --> 17:51.059
I'm a little disappointed.

17:51.061 --> 17:53.862
- Oh, please.
Are you parenting me?

17:53.864 --> 17:54.596
Because ew.

17:54.598 --> 17:55.864
- We're adults, Lacey.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.132
- I'm well aware
of that, Kevin.

17:57.134 --> 17:59.301
- Which means that we don't
stay out all night.

17:59.303 --> 18:00.969
How would it look
for Jenna if--

18:00.971 --> 18:03.004
- oh, you know what?

18:03.006 --> 18:03.872
Shut up.

18:03.874 --> 18:04.673
- Excuse me?

18:04.675 --> 18:06.675
- You had four years
of doing this.

18:06.677 --> 18:07.776
I never got to go to college,

18:07.778 --> 18:09.344
and I never got to be
irresponsible,

18:09.346 --> 18:12.781
because I was busy
raising our daughter.

18:12.783 --> 18:16.151
So I think I deserve
one God damn night

18:16.153 --> 18:18.620
of the college experience.

18:18.622 --> 18:19.554
And furthermore,

18:19.556 --> 18:22.758
I just got in
from six hours of foreplay

18:22.760 --> 18:25.527
with some very hot
college guys,

18:25.529 --> 18:30.232
so somebody better
finish me off,

18:30.234 --> 18:33.101
and I mean pronto.

18:33.103 --> 18:34.302
- So, Miss Kaplan,

18:34.304 --> 18:37.305
what do you think
you can bring to this school?

18:37.307 --> 18:39.608
- Uh...

18:39.610 --> 18:42.010
T...

18:42.012 --> 18:43.712
T...

18:43.714 --> 18:45.614
Acronyms.

18:45.616 --> 18:46.515
Tamara.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.884
- I'm not sure I understand.

18:49.252 --> 18:51.720
What are those marks
on your arm?

18:51.722 --> 18:54.055
- These are reminders

18:54.057 --> 18:59.528
of all the ways I would be
an asset to this school.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.829
There are...

19:00.831 --> 19:03.098
Oh, God, 12 marks--
ways.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.299
There are 12 ways.

19:04.301 --> 19:05.267
- And what are those ways?

19:05.269 --> 19:09.538
- Well, the first is, um...

19:09.540 --> 19:10.539
Um...

19:10.541 --> 19:12.174
Oh, God, what is that?

19:12.176 --> 19:13.408
- Oh, that.

19:13.410 --> 19:14.242
[Retching quietly]

19:14.244 --> 19:17.145
It's just my Harvard diploma.

19:19.382 --> 19:20.582
- And that's when I realized

19:20.584 --> 19:22.784
that the transformative power
of literature

19:22.786 --> 19:23.985
is nothing without literacy.

19:23.987 --> 19:25.053
If I'm accepted here,

19:25.055 --> 19:26.555
I want to volunteer
at the literacy center

19:26.557 --> 19:28.924
to pass on what I've learned
to the next generation.

19:28.926 --> 19:30.392
- That's fantastic.

19:30.394 --> 19:32.093
I have to tell you,
Miss Hamilton.

19:32.095 --> 19:35.096
You seem
like an excellent fit.

19:46.509 --> 19:49.477
[Camera shutter clicks]

19:57.019 --> 19:57.886
- Hey.

19:57.888 --> 20:00.155
How was your interview?
- Killed it.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.356
But this school isn't that fun.

20:01.358 --> 20:03.959
I don't think I want to go here
after all.

20:03.961 --> 20:04.826
- I think I do.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.827
Before this weekend,

20:05.829 --> 20:07.596
I pictured college
as high school but better--

20:07.598 --> 20:09.898
T and I in
a permanent slumber party,

20:09.900 --> 20:11.766
my parents
hundreds of miles away.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.268
After this weekend,
it was clear

20:13.270 --> 20:16.471
college wouldn't be anything
like the way I pictured it.

20:16.473 --> 20:18.807
[Cell phone vibrates]

20:29.485 --> 20:32.254
[Engine turning over]

20:32.256 --> 20:35.223
It would be even better.

20:37.260 --> 20:38.260
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:38.262 --> 20:39.561
- The Mr. PHHS pageant
is in five days.

20:39.563 --> 20:41.029
- Are you coming
to Jenna's pageant?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.364
- Mom.
- I'd love to come.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.265
- Ah.
- Great.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.633
- You said
you were done catfishing.

20:44.635 --> 20:46.101
- Almost.
- Things are getting intense.

20:46.103 --> 20:49.938
I'm really into her.
- You've never even met her.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.340
- Hello?
- Autumn, did you hear my song?

20:52.342 --> 20:54.910
- I loved it.

20:54.912 --> 20:56.411
- It's you.
