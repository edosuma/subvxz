00:01.461 --> 00:03.546
3, 2, 1, zero.
You go in off that.

00:03.594 --> 00:05.000
It's 1, 2, 3, go.

00:05.034 --> 00:06.287
Zero. That's when
you go in.

00:06.321 --> 00:07.541
Fuck.

00:07.576 --> 00:09.249
The guy's not stopping!

00:11.092 --> 00:12.446
The warhead that went up

00:12.480 --> 00:14.189
was supposed to go to freedom fighters.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.399
Why not just give them one
of the other weapons?

00:16.434 --> 00:18.394
Because they're already
spoken for, aren't they?

00:18.395 --> 00:20.155
Major, we have a visitor.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.366
20's days are numbered
after this little screw-up.

00:22.401 --> 00:24.667
I'm afraid nothing will really change

00:24.701 --> 00:26.680
until I let these bombs go off.

00:27.805 --> 00:29.061
Now I have eyes on Hanson!

00:29.095 --> 00:30.218
Do it.

00:30.253 --> 00:32.198
Put the gun down!

00:32.515 --> 00:34.461
Michael, promise you'll never forgive me.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.763
You told Knox that we turned the lawyer.

01:19.959 --> 01:22.272
So you're gonna shoot me?

01:22.307 --> 01:27.375
That's what I do.
I'm a cold-blooded killer, remember?

01:28.837 --> 01:32.112
Damien, killing me isn't
gonna erase your past.

01:33.574 --> 01:35.295
You know that.

01:36.657 --> 01:38.845
It's not gonna make anything better.

01:47.064 --> 01:48.024
Fuck!

01:48.058 --> 01:49.285
Hanson's in custody.

01:49.312 --> 01:52.924
The South Africans are
closing in hard on Bryant.

01:52.966 --> 01:55.455
I want you there with them.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.912
Yeah, roger that.
I'm on my way.

02:01.956 --> 02:05.074
So now what?
We gonna put a bullet in each other?

02:05.108 --> 02:05.923
Maybe that's how

02:05.954 --> 02:08.026
things are supposed to
end between us, Christy.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.356
No.

02:12.443 --> 02:14.995
I can get you to Knox.

02:15.029 --> 02:16.558
Go fuck yourself.

02:16.592 --> 02:18.349
He asked me to set up a meeting

02:18.383 --> 02:19.906
between him and the Nigerians.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.902
Where?

02:20.936 --> 02:23.327
He tells me, I tell you.

02:24.624 --> 02:27.210
You get to play the good soldier

02:27.245 --> 02:29.630
if you can...

02:29.665 --> 02:31.155
If what, Christy?

02:31.187 --> 02:34.040
Get me out of here.

02:34.075 --> 02:35.603
Your call, baby.

02:39.257 --> 02:41.482
Sit on that couch.

02:49.022 --> 02:50.084
Get up!

02:50.113 --> 02:52.405
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

03:02.752 --> 03:04.747
Thanks.

03:04.782 --> 03:06.275
Get out!

03:08.452 --> 03:09.694
Here.

03:26.203 --> 03:27.474
Go!

03:28.380 --> 03:29.649
Run!

03:39.860 --> 03:41.580
Bryant, stop!
Stay the fuck where you are!

03:41.581 --> 03:43.496
Mike, no!

03:43.530 --> 03:44.463
No.

03:44.497 --> 03:45.617
What the fuck are you doing?

03:45.618 --> 03:47.399
Put that gun down, Michael.

03:48.909 --> 03:50.609
- Michael...
- Fuck.

03:50.644 --> 03:52.344
Put the fucking
gun down. Come on.

03:52.379 --> 03:54.414
You're smuggling out a target, Scott.

03:54.448 --> 03:56.449
Put that gun down.
Please.

03:56.483 --> 03:57.417
Don't shoot her.

03:57.451 --> 03:59.485
I just let the man who shot my wife

03:59.519 --> 04:01.820
ride away in the back of a police car.

04:01.854 --> 04:03.121
Now, I could have killed him,

04:03.155 --> 04:04.589
but I chose the mission, Scott.

04:04.623 --> 04:07.692
This is about
the mission. Please.

04:07.726 --> 04:11.196
You got to trust me on this.
Don't shoot her.

04:13.399 --> 04:14.499
Mike.

04:17.036 --> 04:19.204
Mike, please.

04:21.808 --> 04:24.778
Go. Go.

04:24.812 --> 04:25.712
Thanks.

04:25.746 --> 04:28.982
Run!
Go! Go!

04:33.954 --> 04:35.221
Get out of the car!

04:35.289 --> 04:39.993
Get out of the fucking car!
Out! Get out! Out!

04:46.067 --> 04:47.434
Shit!

04:48.603 --> 04:49.870

06:35.246 --> 06:38.381
Hanson got himself arrested.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.919
Did he, now?

06:44.788 --> 06:48.024
Mr. Knox,
I need to ask.

06:48.959 --> 06:51.427
This meeting...

06:51.461 --> 06:53.696
What the lawyer said...

06:53.730 --> 06:55.650
I'm not seeing how dealing
with these Nigerians

06:55.651 --> 06:57.833
can get you what you want.

07:00.537 --> 07:03.005
I know places we can...

07:04.574 --> 07:06.943
It's not too late to leave, regroup,

07:07.010 --> 07:08.511
find another way.

07:08.545 --> 07:12.915
That map used to belong to my old man.

07:12.983 --> 07:15.818
He sent it home from Johannesburg.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.354
He worked there for a while after the war.

07:18.388 --> 07:20.389
Used to hang on our living room wall...

07:20.424 --> 07:24.895
covering a damp patch.

07:24.929 --> 07:27.531
I used to love looking at it,

07:27.565 --> 07:30.200
all those colors.

07:32.337 --> 07:35.139
Till I found out what they meant.

07:37.509 --> 07:39.711
Belgian Congo.

07:39.745 --> 07:43.282
French West Africa.

07:43.349 --> 07:45.617
British fucking Empire.

07:52.125 --> 07:55.928
We were all supposed to join him.

07:55.963 --> 07:58.465
Then suddenly he was home...

08:01.102 --> 08:03.237
and the map came down.

08:25.460 --> 08:29.530
You got this cigarette
to tell me your play.

08:37.339 --> 08:38.940
When the coup went south,

08:38.975 --> 08:41.376
Knox thought of another
use for the weapons.

08:41.409 --> 08:43.044
I hooked him up with Lucas

08:43.078 --> 08:44.980
because he had all the contacts,

08:45.014 --> 08:47.916
but I was setting Knox up.

08:47.984 --> 08:49.851
As soon as I knew where those bombs were,

08:49.886 --> 08:50.986
I'd call the marines in,

08:50.987 --> 08:52.387
and I'd get back in the good graces

08:52.422 --> 08:54.623
of the company.

08:54.657 --> 08:57.192
But the truck crash fucked everything up.

08:57.226 --> 08:59.161
It had the Nigerians
wanting their money back

08:59.195 --> 09:01.330
and Lucas wanting out.

09:02.732 --> 09:05.334
At the base, I knew you already had Lucas.

09:05.368 --> 09:06.268
I knew you'd turn him,

09:06.302 --> 09:08.103
so I had to tip off Knox.

09:08.137 --> 09:09.338
Why?

09:09.372 --> 09:10.439
To keep his trust.

09:10.473 --> 09:11.953
And a little percentage for yourself.

09:11.954 --> 09:12.754
What does it matter,

09:12.755 --> 09:14.176
as long as I get him to you?

09:14.210 --> 09:15.250
It's all part of the game.

09:15.251 --> 09:18.113
Don't call it a fucking game.

09:18.147 --> 09:20.783
It's not a game when
innocent people get killed.

09:20.817 --> 09:22.751
I told you that 7 years ago.

09:25.655 --> 09:26.922
You haven't changed a bit.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.824
What we were doing then
was important work.

09:28.858 --> 09:30.098
No, Christy, what was important

09:30.099 --> 09:32.261
was that you faced up to what we'd done,

09:32.295 --> 09:34.596
to what we'd become.

09:34.630 --> 09:37.599
A couple of killers fucking
each other between marks.

09:37.633 --> 09:40.602
You and I were more than that.

09:42.404 --> 09:44.805
No, we weren't.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.174
You made that quite clear.

09:48.643 --> 09:51.779
I told you I was done after what happened.

09:51.813 --> 09:56.150
I gave you a choice...
me or the next job.

09:56.184 --> 09:58.586
You made your fucking choice.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.088
You know how I feel about you.

10:01.156 --> 10:03.324
Bullshit, Christy.

10:08.963 --> 10:13.200
If you feel anything for me, Christy,

10:13.234 --> 10:16.003
then you'll do this one thing for me.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.915
Ozzy. The CIA lady.

11:00.251 --> 11:03.720
Knox, If he wants to meet, we meet here.

11:03.755 --> 11:06.556
Anywhere else is just too dangerous.

11:18.103 --> 11:21.305
Jesus. Stop the car.
He's gonna hurl.

11:25.744 --> 11:26.744
Come on out the car.

11:30.015 --> 11:32.516
You ok?

11:37.255 --> 11:38.655
He's out!

11:38.690 --> 11:40.957
Shoot!

12:06.416 --> 12:08.550
Ha...

12:18.626 --> 12:21.161
The prodigal son returns.

12:21.195 --> 12:22.629
Yeah.

12:29.604 --> 12:31.938
Knox is going back to the Nigerians?

12:31.972 --> 12:33.239
You're sure?

12:33.274 --> 12:34.274
No.

12:34.308 --> 12:37.644
Apparently, that's what she heard.

12:37.678 --> 12:41.381
When she finds out where,
I asked her to contact me.

12:41.415 --> 12:45.585
What, you... appealed
to her better judgment?

12:45.619 --> 12:48.755
Yeah. What did you want me
to do... bring her back here?

12:48.789 --> 12:51.024
She wouldn't have told us a fucking thing.

12:54.962 --> 12:58.398
You went there to kill her, didn't you?

13:03.137 --> 13:06.606
We all know I worked
contracts for Christy.

13:08.042 --> 13:12.112
I made sure I read
every file on my targets,

13:12.146 --> 13:14.481
cover to cover.

13:14.515 --> 13:18.184
Except on my last contract for her,

13:18.219 --> 13:19.686
the file neglected to mention

13:19.720 --> 13:21.454
that my target...

13:23.157 --> 13:26.359
a corrupt American businessman...

13:26.393 --> 13:28.895
dealing with FARC

13:28.930 --> 13:34.433
was driving his son
Daniel to school that day.

13:37.869 --> 13:42.105
Quito, Ecuador.

13:42.140 --> 13:46.243
July 14, 2005.

13:46.277 --> 13:47.557
That was the day I blew up a kid

13:47.558 --> 13:50.214
for the stars and stripes.

13:52.417 --> 13:56.686
So, yeah, I went to kill her.

13:59.257 --> 14:03.560
And she offered us a shot at Knox,

14:03.594 --> 14:05.061
so...

14:11.468 --> 14:14.336
Well, you didn't know that
the CIA had cut her loose.

14:14.370 --> 14:16.772
She's on the run from her own side.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.542
She'll only be watching her own back.

14:21.576 --> 14:24.111
She does that.

14:24.146 --> 14:26.280
I know it's a long shot.

14:26.347 --> 14:27.981
But that's all we got, mate.

14:28.016 --> 14:29.783
Yeah.

14:29.817 --> 14:31.685
Yeah.

15:07.419 --> 15:12.222
Welcome to Hillbrow...
the end of the line.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.057
Needs must.

15:20.298 --> 15:22.432
This is the place.

15:34.144 --> 15:37.180
Hey, white man.

15:37.214 --> 15:39.182
White man.

15:52.729 --> 15:54.396
Yeah, what do you want?

15:54.431 --> 15:56.098
We're looking for Ozzy.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.576
Where's your boss?

16:08.179 --> 16:09.980
Come with me.

16:24.329 --> 16:26.163
Sometimes I tell them

16:26.198 --> 16:28.399
they cannot just do whatever they want.

16:35.806 --> 16:37.207
Is that her?

16:38.109 --> 16:39.175
Yeah.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.211
Crest Hotel. Sixth floor.

16:41.245 --> 16:42.379
What about it?

16:42.413 --> 16:44.548
That's Knox and the Nigerian's RV point.

16:44.582 --> 16:46.850
That address is Hillbrow.

16:46.885 --> 16:48.352
It's a warren of hijacked buildings,

16:48.386 --> 16:50.520
a no-go area
for the police.

16:50.555 --> 16:53.089
But if Knox is in there, I'm coming.

16:58.262 --> 16:59.729
Over there.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.303
Mr. Knox, welcome.

17:07.369 --> 17:11.440
A pleasure to finally meet you.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.808
Ha ha ha!

17:12.843 --> 17:14.542
Look at this.

17:14.578 --> 17:16.679
Look at this.

17:16.713 --> 17:21.384
Now the big man is in my place.

17:21.452 --> 17:22.518
Ha ha.

17:22.553 --> 17:23.486
Sit.

17:30.561 --> 17:33.632
Bravo, rendezvous with Delta Team in 10.

17:33.699 --> 17:35.902
Roger that, Zero!

17:39.341 --> 17:41.042
Check. Let's go!

17:44.880 --> 17:47.148
Well, gentlemen, my work here is done.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.816
Subject to...

18:00.028 --> 18:01.362
They're clean?

18:01.396 --> 18:03.498
Something's got to be clean around here.

18:08.871 --> 18:11.506
Nice doing business with you, gentlemen.

18:13.877 --> 18:15.077
Go.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.282
Yeah, move.

18:19.317 --> 18:25.223
I have to remind you that
I am still out of pocket.

18:25.291 --> 18:26.891
I hate this town enough

18:26.926 --> 18:30.596
without having to lose my
money here, too, now,

18:30.663 --> 18:35.300
I need to know the extent
of your commitment...

18:35.335 --> 18:36.735
how much you really want to change

18:36.769 --> 18:39.171
the face of our continent.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.812
Our continent?

18:48.782 --> 18:49.949
Listen to this guy.

18:52.219 --> 18:54.554
Our continent!

18:54.588 --> 18:56.956
Our continent.

18:58.325 --> 19:01.662
And adopted son can love
a mother just as much.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.868
My guy.

19:11.539 --> 19:14.408
My guy.

19:14.442 --> 19:16.843
I like you,
Mr. Knox.

19:29.490 --> 19:30.523
There!

19:30.558 --> 19:32.426
Yeah, roger that.

19:32.493 --> 19:34.528
Get ready. Down.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.942
Good luck, soldier.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.401
Go! Let's go!
Move! Move!

20:20.713 --> 20:22.848
Door locked.

20:22.882 --> 20:25.451
3, 2, 1!

20:25.485 --> 20:26.418
He went on 1.

20:26.453 --> 20:27.453
Fuck off.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.754
Ha ha!

20:32.559 --> 20:34.794
Move!

20:43.236 --> 20:45.137
RV, sixth floor.

20:51.044 --> 20:52.579
Bravo Team on our way up.

20:52.613 --> 20:54.514
Delta Team on our way down.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.931
When you first heard my proposal,

21:10.999 --> 21:12.299
what did you think?

21:12.334 --> 21:14.602
I saw an opportunity.

21:15.837 --> 21:18.205
Nuclear weapons...

21:18.239 --> 21:20.674
they're strange things.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.710
How much do you hate this city?

21:23.744 --> 21:26.813
How much do I hate this city?

21:26.847 --> 21:29.348
What will you do to prove it?

21:30.617 --> 21:33.119
The great freedom
fighters of the Niger Delta

21:33.153 --> 21:35.054
will carve the path to liberty

21:35.088 --> 21:36.622
with the aid of this weapon.

21:36.657 --> 21:38.124
Please.

21:39.259 --> 21:42.828
I need to know if you will do it

21:42.863 --> 21:45.198
and take the credit for it.

21:45.232 --> 21:46.499
My terms are these.

21:46.533 --> 21:50.670
$5 million, 3 hours to get away.

21:52.039 --> 21:55.041
Ozzy! They come!
Intruders in the building!

21:55.109 --> 21:56.869
Bravo Team in
position on sixth floor west.

21:56.870 --> 21:58.445
Delta Team, report.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.813
Bravo Team, we are in position,

21:59.881 --> 22:01.348
sixth floor east.

22:01.382 --> 22:02.416
We need to leave.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.084
This way.
This way!

22:06.388 --> 22:07.388
Stop them!

22:07.422 --> 22:08.856
Move!

22:16.297 --> 22:17.498
Go!

22:33.481 --> 22:35.482
Fuck me!

22:36.817 --> 22:38.451
Let's go! Go!

22:43.723 --> 22:45.424
Bravo, we're coming down!

22:45.459 --> 22:46.792
Move!

22:50.230 --> 22:51.197
In!

22:51.231 --> 22:52.998
Fuck!

22:58.205 --> 22:59.205
Fuck!

23:05.346 --> 23:07.547
Delta Team, hold position!

23:17.058 --> 23:18.926
Room clear!

23:39.647 --> 23:41.481
Go home.

23:50.457 --> 23:53.859
Knox exiting meth lab.
We have men down!

24:02.468 --> 24:04.669
Move, move, move!
In pursuit of target!

24:04.737 --> 24:06.204
Heading towards meth lab.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.139
- Clear!
- Coming out!

24:08.173 --> 24:09.173
You guys all right?

24:09.208 --> 24:10.341
Yeah!

24:14.480 --> 24:16.748
Go! Move!

24:16.783 --> 24:19.084
On the ground! Go!
On the ground!

24:19.118 --> 24:21.119
Get on the fucking ground!
Down!

24:28.862 --> 24:30.729
Fuck!

24:30.764 --> 24:33.065
I have eyes on the Nigerian.

24:36.703 --> 24:39.204
Bravo One, come in.
Bravo, I'm in pursuit of target.

24:39.239 --> 24:40.359
Meet me on the ground level.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.274
Coming to you.

24:41.308 --> 24:42.348
Delta Team leader is down.

24:42.349 --> 24:45.011
I repeat, Delta Team leader is down.

24:45.045 --> 24:46.480
Hold tight.

24:59.326 --> 25:00.659
Go!

25:00.694 --> 25:02.694
Go, go, go, go, go!
Now! Go, go!

25:28.256 --> 25:29.189
Fuck.

25:29.257 --> 25:30.223
Changing!

25:30.258 --> 25:31.491
All right!

25:31.526 --> 25:33.093
Fuck. You got
a visual on Knox?

25:33.127 --> 25:35.695
Negative on Knox.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.097
Hold them back!

25:40.468 --> 25:41.568
Ok.

25:44.773 --> 25:46.006
Go!

25:47.809 --> 25:49.209
Move, move, move, move!

25:50.746 --> 25:51.846
Fuck!

25:52.848 --> 25:53.781
Two guns!

25:53.815 --> 25:55.215
Yeah, I see them.
I see them.

25:57.719 --> 26:00.120
Fuck me!

26:20.841 --> 26:22.241
What are you doing?

26:23.844 --> 26:27.146
I'm handing in
my notice, Mr. Knox.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.214
I got you out of there

26:28.215 --> 26:29.615
in the hope you'll live long enough

26:29.649 --> 26:33.086
to come to your senses.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.856
I signed up for a coup.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.025
That's soldiers' work.

26:39.561 --> 26:42.563
But blowing up a city...

26:42.598 --> 26:45.166
for some personal grievance?

26:46.402 --> 26:50.138
I don't know who you're
trying to pay back...

26:50.173 --> 26:52.274
but don't claim this is about integrity

26:52.308 --> 26:53.942
or justice.

26:55.044 --> 26:56.712
It ends here.

27:06.089 --> 27:07.689
I should have known this would go bad.

27:07.724 --> 27:08.790
I should have known

27:08.825 --> 27:10.926
when you made me hire
that sick fuck Hanson.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.938
Didn't have you down for a deserter.

27:22.972 --> 27:25.808
Shot in the back.

27:25.842 --> 27:26.809
That figures.

27:26.843 --> 27:30.078
For Christ's sake, finish it.

27:34.551 --> 27:36.319
What did I miss?

27:54.505 --> 27:59.309
Yes, Knox is in the wind.

27:59.343 --> 28:01.478
You need to know that
targeting the Nigerians

28:01.546 --> 28:04.481
was the right thing to do.

28:04.515 --> 28:10.187
We have a job to finish here.

28:13.891 --> 28:15.659
Ava, it's your father.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.260
Now listen.

28:20.998 --> 28:23.934
What they've been
saying me on the television

28:24.002 --> 28:26.169
and in the papers,

28:26.203 --> 28:29.306
but I want to explain, face to face.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.909
I'm in Cairo, so just pack up your things

28:31.943 --> 28:33.710
and get on the next flight.

28:33.744 --> 28:36.064
We've had a trace on Knox's
daughter's phone for 4 weeks.

28:36.065 --> 28:37.814
You don't want to disappoint your old man.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.282
I've got his exact location.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.717
Fuck.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.687
Major?

29:15.721 --> 29:18.456
What have you got?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.990
Why does a man who burns his passport

29:20.025 --> 29:22.192
arrange to meet someone abroad?

29:24.028 --> 29:25.562
'Cause he's staying.

29:25.596 --> 29:27.764
And he wants them to leave.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.067
Move out! Move out!

29:31.102 --> 29:32.602
Come on! Come on!
Jump on! Jump on!

29:32.637 --> 29:34.872
Knox doesn't act randomly.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.773
If he's asking his daughter
to leave Jo'burg,

29:36.808 --> 29:39.509
he will have a target in mind.

29:55.860 --> 29:59.462
"Philip Knox, the Colonial
Endeavour Bank."

29:59.496 --> 30:00.563
Richmond!

30:00.597 --> 30:02.331
Move out, move out, move out, move out.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move, move, move, move, move.

30:04.668 --> 30:05.988
Come on. Come on.
Come on, boys.

30:05.989 --> 30:07.570
Come on, come on,
come on. Let's go!

30:07.604 --> 30:10.639
Records show Knox's father
worked at the bank until 1950.

30:10.673 --> 30:12.608
The building was demolished in the sixties

30:12.642 --> 30:14.910
to make way for a children's playground.

30:14.978 --> 30:16.298
The unofficial bank of Apartheid.

30:16.332 --> 30:18.812
Half the gold and diamonds of
Africa went through those doors

30:18.813 --> 30:19.573
but never came out.

30:19.574 --> 30:20.816
Where did they go?

30:20.851 --> 30:24.854
One of the worst-kept
secrets in Johannesburg.

30:24.922 --> 30:26.823
The tunnels.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.863
Watch the corner.
Watch the corner.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.733
They moved the gold
and diamonds under the city.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.927
There are still a dozen entry
points to those tunnels

30:37.928 --> 30:39.169
to this day.

30:47.811 --> 30:49.846
License plate recognition coming in.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.148
Bingo. Major.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.016
This plate matches one on a vehicle

30:54.051 --> 30:56.819
that was seen leaving after the
shooting of the lawyer Lucas.

30:56.853 --> 30:58.933
It's parked really close
to one of the entry points

30:58.934 --> 30:59.588
to the tunnels.

30:59.622 --> 31:00.782
It leads directly to the site

31:00.790 --> 31:02.624
of the old Colonial Endeavour.

31:02.692 --> 31:03.758
That's fucking Hanson.

31:04.994 --> 31:08.530
We find Hanson,
we find those bombs, Major.

31:08.598 --> 31:10.766
He wants us to find him.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.407
Right. I want
visual above ground

31:12.438 --> 31:13.532
for that whole area.

31:13.555 --> 31:17.139
CCTV, face recognition, everything.

31:17.173 --> 31:18.140
I'm already on it.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.541
Richmond, let's go!

31:37.160 --> 31:38.280
All right, we're going down.

31:38.295 --> 31:39.729
We're gonna lose comms down there.

31:39.763 --> 31:41.064
Stay above ground.

31:41.098 --> 31:42.766
Come down if you need to.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.634
Major, I have visual on Knox.

31:44.669 --> 31:45.902
Where is he?

31:45.937 --> 31:47.777
He's half a click from
your current location.

31:47.778 --> 31:48.978
I'm uploading coordinates now.

31:48.979 --> 31:50.173
In position.

31:58.182 --> 32:00.250
Let's go.
The bank vaults are this way.

32:00.318 --> 32:01.985
Copy that.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.312
Clear.

32:26.346 --> 32:28.547
Yeah, clear.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.675
What have you got over there?

32:30.683 --> 32:33.252
A fucking shitload of wires
and a big fucking bomb.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.587
All right.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.456
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:39.893 --> 32:41.227
Should we open her up?

32:41.294 --> 32:43.062
Yeah.
What's the worst that could happen?

32:43.096 --> 32:45.465
I promise
I won't say "bang."

32:48.736 --> 32:49.703
What the fuck?

32:49.771 --> 32:51.004
It's paired.

32:51.039 --> 32:52.606
There's two.

32:52.640 --> 32:53.607
Fuck me.

32:53.641 --> 32:54.675
There's another bomb.

32:54.743 --> 32:55.876
Motherfucker.

32:55.911 --> 32:58.145
It's got to be in the
other tunnel somewhere.

33:02.951 --> 33:04.852
Shit.

33:15.498 --> 33:18.467
Major Dalton, I believe.

33:18.501 --> 33:20.335
We know where they are.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.371
My men are defusing them as we speak.

33:22.405 --> 33:24.740
They're wasting their time.

33:26.376 --> 33:28.444
Do you know what this is?

33:29.513 --> 33:30.873
Do you understand what will happen

33:30.874 --> 33:32.448
if you release that button?

33:32.515 --> 33:33.715
Julia.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.750
Send.

33:34.784 --> 33:36.251
Knox has a dead man's trigger.

33:36.286 --> 33:39.788
You need to get down
there and let them know.

33:43.726 --> 33:45.626
Go.

33:46.662 --> 33:48.229
Shit.

33:48.263 --> 33:49.764
You'll be killing...

33:49.798 --> 33:52.667
I know exactly how many people

33:52.701 --> 33:54.102
will be killed.

33:54.136 --> 33:56.104
Not just the explosion.

33:56.138 --> 33:57.639
The radiation.

33:57.673 --> 33:58.941
There's number two.
Shit.

33:58.975 --> 34:00.709
Yeah.

34:00.744 --> 34:01.644
Cover me?

34:01.678 --> 34:02.645
Yeah, I got you.

34:02.679 --> 34:04.881
This is exactly like the last system.

34:04.915 --> 34:05.982
It's definitely connected.

34:06.016 --> 34:07.451
We've got siamese bombs?

34:07.485 --> 34:09.645
If we deactivate this one
without doing the other one

34:09.646 --> 34:12.657
at exactly the same time, it'll detonate.

34:12.690 --> 34:13.623
Shit.

34:13.692 --> 34:15.226
All right.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.094
I'm gonna head back to that first one.

34:17.129 --> 34:18.929
- Ok.
- Give me exactly 5 minutes.

34:18.964 --> 34:20.031
Yeah. Good.

34:21.801 --> 34:23.501
Good.

34:23.536 --> 34:26.103
All right.
So, Mike,

34:26.138 --> 34:29.774
on zero, we both pull those triggers.

34:29.808 --> 34:31.708
It has to be at exactly the same time.

34:31.744 --> 34:32.777
I know.
I know.

34:32.812 --> 34:33.777
Good luck.

34:33.813 --> 34:35.213
You, too, bud.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.362
One square mile where
half the wealth of a continent

34:49.397 --> 34:54.802
is being hoarded by a handful
of very greedy men...

34:54.835 --> 34:57.805
even now.

34:57.839 --> 34:59.440
Shit.

35:19.029 --> 35:21.931
Why Kerry?

35:21.965 --> 35:24.267
Why not me?!

35:24.301 --> 35:26.368
I was standing right there.

35:28.238 --> 35:30.106
Not enough.

35:30.140 --> 35:34.277
You needed to know how it feels.

35:34.345 --> 35:35.345
You took away my brother,

35:35.346 --> 35:37.781
and the only thing I gave a shit about.

35:42.820 --> 35:45.956
This isn't about Africa.

35:45.990 --> 35:48.559
This is about the bank.

35:48.593 --> 35:51.795
This is about your father.

35:51.863 --> 35:53.631
This is about you.

35:56.067 --> 35:57.935
He worked here.

35:59.938 --> 36:02.806
Very good.
Yes, he did.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.009
He worked here for a while.

36:08.412 --> 36:11.248
Till they spat him out.

36:12.617 --> 36:15.685
He was offering loans to black traders,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.987
so they shipped him home

36:18.022 --> 36:21.091
and shattered all of our dreams.

36:22.326 --> 36:25.428
Jake was a good kid.

36:25.463 --> 36:29.166
And I should have done
something, but I didn't.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.867
Jake shouldn't have been there.

36:30.901 --> 36:33.236
He wasn't like you and me.

36:35.172 --> 36:36.692
And why would anyone really want to be

36:36.693 --> 36:38.508
anything like you and me?

36:38.543 --> 36:41.344
Everything we've done.

36:41.379 --> 36:43.813
I mean, fuck this for a
game of soldiers, Michael.

36:43.848 --> 36:45.215
Look at us.

36:46.350 --> 36:48.184
There is death in everything we touch,

36:48.219 --> 36:49.419
everything.

36:49.453 --> 36:52.422
Kerry!
Kerry.

36:54.458 --> 36:56.325
Jake paid the price.

37:08.305 --> 37:09.438
Fuck!

37:51.683 --> 37:53.217
Come here!

38:00.158 --> 38:01.725
Fuck.

38:03.194 --> 38:05.128
Fucker.

38:05.163 --> 38:06.963
Go! Go!

38:18.776 --> 38:20.644
What the fuck is it gonna take, Michael?

38:31.456 --> 38:32.823
Fuck me.

38:36.161 --> 38:37.494
Fuck.

38:42.234 --> 38:44.335
Come on, Stonebridge.

38:44.369 --> 38:45.803
Fuck.

38:47.806 --> 38:49.974
You better go on fucking zero.

38:55.413 --> 38:57.414
Hanson, no!

38:57.448 --> 38:59.482
Fuck this. Mike!

39:12.196 --> 39:14.297
Fuck.

39:14.331 --> 39:16.532
What the fuck is going on?!

39:20.103 --> 39:23.004
I want you to know...

39:23.039 --> 39:24.640
I forgive you.

39:35.918 --> 39:37.585
Michael!

39:37.619 --> 39:40.320
Richmond! Come here!

39:40.355 --> 39:42.489
Look around you.

39:43.558 --> 39:44.878
Look at what you'd be blowing up.

39:44.879 --> 39:46.694
It'll put an end to the corruption

39:46.728 --> 39:50.864
that this festering place is built on.

39:50.898 --> 39:53.233
Please. An act of
nihilism?

39:53.268 --> 39:55.002
An act nevertheless.

39:55.937 --> 39:57.037
Shit!

39:57.105 --> 39:59.106
Michael!
It's Knox.

39:59.141 --> 40:01.008
He has a dead man's trigger.

40:01.043 --> 40:02.009
I have to talk to Scott.

40:02.044 --> 40:03.177
There is no time.

40:03.212 --> 40:05.647
We need a countdown...
a new countdown.

40:17.692 --> 40:18.692
Come on.

40:18.727 --> 40:20.928
Come on, Scott.

40:23.165 --> 40:26.267
4. Is that a fucking
countdown, Michael?

40:28.604 --> 40:32.407
3. Reading you loud
and clear, bud.

40:32.441 --> 40:34.442
2.

40:34.476 --> 40:36.077
2.

40:36.111 --> 40:38.079
1.

40:38.113 --> 40:39.781
Go on zero.

40:41.432 --> 40:43.284
Fuck me.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.391
No!

40:55.297 --> 40:56.931
Fuck.

41:10.745 --> 41:11.979
No!

41:21.023 --> 41:22.523
God.

41:29.965 --> 41:33.334
Zero, weapons have been deactivated.
Do you copy?

41:33.369 --> 41:35.137
Dalton has been shot, by Knox.

41:35.171 --> 41:36.338
Shit!

41:36.372 --> 41:37.940
I have visual.
He's close by.

41:37.974 --> 41:39.508
You get Knox.
I'll look for Dalton.

41:39.576 --> 41:41.010
Copy that.

41:52.190 --> 41:53.523
Fuck!

41:53.558 --> 41:56.994
Zero, we need medivac here now!

41:57.028 --> 41:59.329
Medivac ETA 5 minutes.

41:59.363 --> 42:01.131
Fuck.

42:20.750 --> 42:22.451
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, he has a gun!

42:22.485 --> 42:24.986
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

42:29.624 --> 42:30.858
Get the gun!

42:42.003 --> 42:44.237
- Back!
- Move! Move!

42:44.271 --> 42:45.772
Back! Stay back!

42:45.806 --> 42:47.674
I never touched him!
I never touched him.

42:47.708 --> 42:49.476
He shot himself.
He fell on his gun!

42:49.510 --> 42:52.078
Look, he fell on his gun.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.380
He's dead.

42:57.619 --> 42:59.587
It's all right.
It's all right.

43:23.912 --> 43:25.680
Hey.

43:28.350 --> 43:30.652
It's one of a matching pair.

43:30.686 --> 43:32.320
Here.

43:33.489 --> 43:36.692
We hung on to them like you said.

43:38.895 --> 43:40.729
Has the,

43:40.797 --> 43:42.398
top brass been in?

43:42.432 --> 43:46.435
Yeah. They brought me
some grapes.

43:48.038 --> 43:52.107
You know, the thing about
those tossers in Whitehall...

43:52.142 --> 43:57.979
they can live with failures
and casualties and defeat.

43:58.013 --> 44:01.449
What really scares them is embarrassment.

44:01.483 --> 44:02.984
They know these triggers

44:03.018 --> 44:05.553
should never have made it to
Libya in the first place.

44:07.055 --> 44:13.794
So I struck a deal.
I hand these over, keep my mouth shut,

44:13.828 --> 44:18.265
and Section 20 has a future after all.

44:18.300 --> 44:20.767
New orders.

44:20.802 --> 44:22.482
You mean after what happened with the nuke

44:22.483 --> 44:23.170
and the crash?

44:23.204 --> 44:24.170
We just assumed

44:24.205 --> 44:25.572
that heads would have to roll.

44:25.606 --> 44:27.807
Maybe one head will be enough.

44:30.944 --> 44:31.877
Let's go.

44:31.912 --> 44:33.279
Ma'am.

44:34.381 --> 44:35.915
Hey.

44:40.153 --> 44:43.156
It's a good thing there was two of you.

44:54.935 --> 44:55.901
Nice.

44:55.936 --> 44:57.536
Yeah.

45:08.181 --> 45:09.114
I don't know about you,

45:09.149 --> 45:10.916
but I think the city owes us a beer.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.751
A beer?

45:12.785 --> 45:15.954
I think this city owes
me 4 weeks in Bora Bora

45:16.022 --> 45:20.459
on a yacht with a fucking
hot "Playboy" centerfold.

45:20.493 --> 45:22.094
That's what I want.

45:25.599 --> 45:28.535
How'd it play out in the end, Mike,

45:28.569 --> 45:29.870
with you and Hanson?

45:29.904 --> 45:32.872
I did the one thing he
didn't want me to do.

45:32.907 --> 45:34.440
What's that?

45:35.676 --> 45:37.377
I forgave him.

45:39.514 --> 45:41.448
Shit.

45:41.482 --> 45:45.118
You're a better man than me, Michael.

45:45.153 --> 45:46.753
Kerry would be proud.

45:48.390 --> 45:50.524
Thanks.

45:50.558 --> 45:53.060
And how about you?

45:53.094 --> 45:54.995
What about me?

45:55.030 --> 45:56.564
Did you forgive yourself?

45:56.598 --> 45:57.765
For Daniel?

45:57.799 --> 45:59.533
Yeah.

45:59.568 --> 46:01.168
No.

46:02.771 --> 46:05.473
I don't think that's ever gonna happen.

46:05.507 --> 46:08.909
You know that dream I told
you about I keep having?

46:08.944 --> 46:11.212
I keep running, can't get away from it?

46:11.247 --> 46:12.914
Yeah.

46:12.948 --> 46:14.916
I think I'm gonna stop running.

46:14.951 --> 46:16.585
That's probably a good idea.

46:16.619 --> 46:20.756
Yeah. Slow things down
to a walk.

46:22.359 --> 46:23.793
A gentle stroll.

46:23.827 --> 46:26.495
Yeah. That sounds nice.

46:29.199 --> 46:30.679
You know, I looked it up, by the way.

46:30.680 --> 46:31.400
What's that?

46:31.435 --> 46:33.435
Zero. It's not only
a concept,

46:33.470 --> 46:34.503
but it is a number.

46:34.538 --> 46:36.338
Are you fucking serious?
You looked that up?

46:36.339 --> 46:38.040
Yeah, I did, like in 10, 20, 30...

46:38.074 --> 46:39.554
Now, stop that.
You know 10, 20, 30.

46:39.555 --> 46:40.859
Stop it. Shut up.

46:40.898 --> 46:43.288
Like 10, 20, 30.
It means zeroes do exist.

46:43.312 --> 46:44.827
Mike, I don't care.
