00:07.367 --> 00:09.200
NARRATOR: Deep in Alaska,

00:09.233 --> 00:11.700
hundreds of miles
from anywhere...

00:11.733 --> 00:14.100
SUE: It is not for the meek.
It's not for the timid.

00:14.133 --> 00:16.800
If you question
your own abilities,
be somewhere else.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.100
...the clock is ticking.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.033
AGNES:
We have to really prepare
ourselves for the cold winter.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.600
NARRATOR:
Temperatures are dropping.

00:29.633 --> 00:32.233
ERIK: This is a seriously
harsh environment.

00:32.267 --> 00:35.167
NARRATOR:
And daylight is disappearing.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.733
SUE:
Winter's barrelling down on me

00:37.767 --> 00:39.167
like a freight train.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.933
NARRATOR: On this season
of Life Below Zero...

00:43.967 --> 00:47.033
SUE: There was a bear sighting
just a few hundred yards away.

00:47.067 --> 00:51.433
Everybody feels
it's gonna be an extremely
aggressive bear year.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.400
GLENN: This is very
hungry country where I am.

00:53.433 --> 00:57.000
There's a reason
why I'm the only person
within many miles of here.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.400
Whoa!

00:58.433 --> 01:00.267
If I fell down, it would
be a slow, painful death.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.333
Whoa!

01:02.367 --> 01:04.967
ANDY: A lot of people die
every year in Alaska
going through the ice.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.967
Ah, shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.467
This time of the year,
it doesn't matter
what you feel like,

01:09.500 --> 01:11.600
you still gotta get up
and get the job done.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.067
Whoa! We got a live one.

01:13.067 --> 01:14.533
CHIP: We are hunters,
not farmers.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.067
We chase it down and kill it,
or we get nothing at all.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.200
You can break down,
freeze to death,
you can crash,

01:20.233 --> 01:22.767
but you gotta get out there
and earn it.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.800
ERIK: It's hard when you're
cold and you're shaking.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.467
If it was easy,
it really wouldn't be fun.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.600
SUE: My name is Susan Aikens,

01:52.633 --> 01:55.367
and I live 197 miles
above the Arctic Circle,

01:55.400 --> 01:58.333
just a few miles
from the Arctic Ocean.

01:58.367 --> 02:01.267
I live by myself out here at a
place called Kavik River Camp.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.533
Population, one.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.333
The meat that I hunt directly
means I live or I die.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.933
I still don't have enough
to get me through the winter.

02:14.967 --> 02:18.533
Gonna go a ways up river
and set up a tent
and see what I can get.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.367
The goal is
I need to fill my freezer,

02:21.400 --> 02:24.700
to put it in my belly,
so I don't die this winter.

02:24.733 --> 02:28.467
Weather in the Arctic
is absolutely unpredictable.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.233
Every sign says
big, bad winter again.

02:31.267 --> 02:36.067
So I have to be
prepared for snow, cold,
pretty much the whole gamut.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.433
It's the changing
of the guard.

02:44.467 --> 02:48.467
Summer and the bounty of that
summer is going to go away.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.067
The caribou migrate out.
They're gone.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.267
The bears go to bed,
they're gone.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.767
Most of the birds migrate out,
they're gone.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.467
So if I'm gonna get meat,
I've gotta get it now.

03:05.633 --> 03:09.633
I'm hoping to leave
with an empty sled
and come back with a full one.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.167
Night-time is back,
northern lights are back,

03:12.200 --> 03:16.800
it's just a quick slide now
into the fun
that we call winter.

03:16.833 --> 03:19.133
NARRATOR: To stock up
for the impending winter,

03:19.167 --> 03:23.333
Sue heads toward
where the Kavik River
meets several valleys,

03:23.367 --> 03:25.667
a prime spot to source food.

03:28.867 --> 03:30.133
SUE: There's your ptarmigans.

03:32.133 --> 03:34.700
Oh, I see some ptarmigans
way out there.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.067
I think I'll just have
to get close and see
where they're hiding.

03:47.233 --> 03:49.500
Where there's one,
there's usually more.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.200
I do have one,
let me go find him.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.567
All right, well...

04:02.433 --> 04:04.433
At least we got
one for dinner.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.100
Thank you, little birdie.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.900
This is a good first step
in filling my freezer.

04:10.933 --> 04:15.500
But I'm gonna need to
do a whole lot more hunting
to survive this winter.

04:17.067 --> 04:20.400
ANDY: I have ideas for how
I want my life to be

04:20.433 --> 04:24.367
and you can make the life
you want when you live out
in the bush like this.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.533
There's nobody telling you
what to do or what not to do.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.267
I'm Andy Bassich.
I live here at Calico Bluff.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.433
Ever since I was a young boy
I kind of had this gut feeling

04:49.467 --> 04:51.100
that I wanted to
live out in the woods.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.133
When I moved up here,
I didn't know anybody,

04:53.167 --> 04:55.367
didn't know anything
about Alaska,

04:55.400 --> 05:00.100
but there were something,
some deep drive inside of me

05:00.133 --> 05:03.333
that put a calling to me to
come out here and live here.

05:03.367 --> 05:04.967
KATE: My name is Kate Rorke.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.167
There are no roads
to where I live.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.667
No close neighbours,

05:08.700 --> 05:12.133
just a whole lot of wildlife
and 20 sled dogs.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.267
ANDY: In Alaska we call it
subsistence living.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.833
Years ago they would have
called it a frontier life,

05:19.867 --> 05:23.800
living out in the woods
and being self-sufficient
as much as possible.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.233
For us, in the upper Yukon,

05:25.267 --> 05:28.300
we go from summer to winter
very, very quickly here.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.067
Fall times are very short

05:30.067 --> 05:31.533
and there's a lot to do
in the fall,

05:31.567 --> 05:34.600
with harvesting gardens,
hunting moose,
and catching fish

05:34.633 --> 05:36.267
for both ourselves
and the dogs.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.333
And we only have
about three weeks to do that.

05:39.367 --> 05:42.300
KATE:
It's a major hurry now to get
the wheel across the river

05:42.333 --> 05:44.233
so that we can get
the good fish

05:44.267 --> 05:47.600
and get them as fresh
as we can to put up
for ourselves.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.267
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate rely
on their home-made fish wheel

05:50.300 --> 05:52.800
in order to secure food
from the river,

05:52.833 --> 05:55.300
but getting it in the water
is a gruelling task.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.733
ANDY: It's a big job
putting a fish wheel in.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.067
Especially when it's just
one or two people.

06:01.100 --> 06:05.467
Quite frankly,
everything that has to do
with fish wheels is heavy.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.333
It takes a lot
of self-motivation
to live out in the bush.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.233
You've gotta be able
to push yourself.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.800
If you're a person that
when the going gets tough,

06:12.833 --> 06:15.233
you just, kind of,
sit down and wait it out,

06:15.267 --> 06:17.167
you're not gonna do
very well out here

06:17.200 --> 06:19.467
because that resource
will either go by

06:19.500 --> 06:22.067
or your opportunity
will be missed.

06:24.267 --> 06:27.933
We're the last community
in Alaska before these fish
go into Canada.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.400
So we're at the end
of the line, basically.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.233
So even though a run
comes in really strong,

06:33.267 --> 06:37.067
if it's fish like crazy
down in the middle
and lower river,

06:37.067 --> 06:40.067
there may not be
a lot of fish in this run
that make it up to here.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.567
We know when
they're expected to come,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.467
but we don't know what
the numbers are gonna be.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.200
KATE: So right now every
minute counts at getting
that wheel in the water.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.067
So the quicker
we get it in the water,

06:49.367 --> 06:51.200
the more luck we're gonna
have at getting some fish

06:51.233 --> 06:52.400
to put up for ourselves.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.100
CHIP: I didn't come here
to hide from anything.

06:57.133 --> 06:58.833
I didn't come here
to find myself.

06:58.867 --> 07:00.233
I just took the skills I have

07:00.267 --> 07:02.500
and I focused it
into the proper way

07:02.533 --> 07:04.533
a man should make
a living for his children.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.300
Whoa.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.267
AGNES: That's one big leg.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.867
-Yee!
-Yup, the meat here
don't come in

07:25.900 --> 07:27.400
pretty little
plastic packages.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.800
It comes wrapped in skin.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.133
We have to skin it,

07:33.167 --> 07:35.933
we have to take
the muscle groups apart

07:35.967 --> 07:37.700
and separate the bones.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.067
There.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.700
CHIP: It's a lot
of work all right,
but it's well worth it.

07:42.733 --> 07:43.767
It's really clean food.

07:44.567 --> 07:47.200
It's beyond organic.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.900
I'm Edward Hailstone,
my friends and family
call me Chip.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.300
I live with
five of my daughters
and my wife here

07:53.333 --> 07:55.433
in Noorvik, Alaska,
along Kobuk River.

07:56.567 --> 07:59.100
And I live
a subsistence lifestyle.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.333
We hunt.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.333
We fish. We gather.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.600
And we do it as a team.

08:10.667 --> 08:14.533
My name is Agnes Hailstone.
I was born in Noorvik,
raised here.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.200
I've been here
pretty much all my life.

08:17.233 --> 08:20.433
My daughters were born here
and hopefully
they'll do the same.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.900
CHIP: So, I'm thinking

08:22.933 --> 08:26.533
this place needs a cache.
We need a place to put this up
and to hang it in.

08:26.567 --> 08:29.067
-Yeah.
-The best thing to do is just

08:29.067 --> 08:31.667
-build a little
something here.
-Just build here?

08:31.700 --> 08:35.467
Yeah, we could use it
this winter until we're
done with it,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.400
so the caribou we get here
will go in the cache.

08:38.433 --> 08:41.767
-Yeah, it'd take at least
10 logs per wall.
-AGNES: Yep.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.567
And it's gonna take beams
for the floor,
beams for the roofing.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.533
-So I'm probably
looking at, like, 50, 60 logs.
-AGNES: Okay.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.467
NARRATOR:
With dark winter approaching,

08:50.500 --> 08:54.533
the Hailstones will soon
partake in their most
crucial hunt of the season.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.633
In preparation, they must
replace their old meat rack

08:57.667 --> 09:01.333
with a new cache
that can store
larger quantities of meat.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.733
CHIP:
When we're gathering wood,

09:02.767 --> 09:04.800
we have to go
at least five miles away
from this town.

09:07.433 --> 09:11.933
-Look at that!
-AGNES: Even skinny ones...
Oh, wow, we scored!

09:11.967 --> 09:15.467
Even those little ones will
do fine for the top, yeah?

09:15.500 --> 09:16.600
CHIP: They should.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.400
AGNES:
Wood have so many purposes,

09:23.433 --> 09:26.133
especially when we live up
here in the extreme cold

09:26.167 --> 09:29.100
and it's always good
to have extra laying around,

09:29.133 --> 09:31.267
because even your neighbours
is gonna run out of fuel

09:31.300 --> 09:33.533
and they'll end up
having to rely on wood.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.867
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

09:38.900 --> 09:43.400
They all say
he who chops his own wood
heats himself up twice.

09:47.567 --> 09:50.367
CHIP: So, I'm throwing
these logs out in the river

09:50.400 --> 09:53.400
and she can bring
the boat right up to them,
add a loop or two to them,

09:53.433 --> 09:56.067
and then go to the next one,
and go to the next one.

09:56.067 --> 09:59.167
We're doing something
that's terribly efficient
and terribly useful.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.967
And the benefits
out of this is everything
from heat to buildings,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and then back to
heating that building.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.667
Looks like the wife
is coming down,
catching up with the logs,

10:10.700 --> 10:11.867
and looks like, um,

10:11.900 --> 10:14.433
all the ones I've tossed
in there along the bank here

10:14.467 --> 10:16.567
are ready to get picked up
here pretty soon.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.833
She's adding rope
and tying them in a bunch.

10:19.867 --> 10:22.500
I think she's doing
a good job.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.633
I was gonna
go over there with the wife,
and go jump in the boat,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.667
and maybe start
manoeuvring her
a little faster.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.700
Here's the next bunch, right?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.767
Okay. Take this out
and attach it to that one.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.033
AGNES: Right on.
We're not leaving any behind.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.267
They're all following.

10:47.700 --> 10:50.500
This enough for now.
This is a good load.

10:52.667 --> 10:56.000
So this is all ahead,
full steam right now.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.867
-(AGNES LAUGHS)
-But it's been a good day.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.700
I've got a good load of wood.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.433
I can sort this stuff out

11:01.467 --> 11:03.500
and get started
making something.

11:05.500 --> 11:09.433
In traditional days, this is
exactly what they would do
to get their firewood.

11:09.467 --> 11:12.067
They'd go at the end
of the year when it's all
nice and dry like this,

11:12.067 --> 11:14.233
and they'd float them on down
the river this time of year

11:14.267 --> 11:17.367
in rafts like
we're doing here,
and that would be that.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.833
And get through the freeze up
when you can't
go out and gather,

11:19.867 --> 11:21.600
when the ice is too thin.

11:24.867 --> 11:27.700
GLENN: I live out here
because I really
enjoy this lifestyle.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.100
I enjoy
the autonomy it affords.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.633
I enjoy the competence
it demands.

11:34.667 --> 11:38.600
I like the connection
to nature I feel when I live
the way I do here.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.100
My name's Glenn Villeneuve.

11:53.133 --> 11:56.233
I live 200 miles
north of Fairbanks
in the Brooks Range of Alaska.

11:59.633 --> 12:02.267
I'm a 60-mile walk
from the nearest road.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.900
My nearest neighbour lives...
I don't know how far away.

12:07.933 --> 12:12.067
I picked this place because
nobody else was utilising
the resources here.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.100
It was a place where I could
go hunt, trap, fish,

12:16.133 --> 12:19.200
live as close to
the land as I wanted to.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.333
And it's the place
I consider home.

12:25.133 --> 12:28.067
It's early in the morning.
It's just barely
starting to get light,

12:28.100 --> 12:31.933
and this is the first day
that I've decided that
I wanna look for a moose.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.067
With almost
nothing else to eat,

12:34.100 --> 12:36.500
I can get by
for six months on a moose.

12:36.533 --> 12:39.533
Okay. That has a razor
sharp edge on it now.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.567
That'll shave hair
right off of my arm.

12:46.067 --> 12:49.567
When you're eating
very little carbohydrate,
like I often am out here,

12:49.600 --> 12:52.867
I have to get about
three quarters
of my calories from fat.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.967
Mmm.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.533
Fat's hard to find.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.667
A lot of animals
don't have enough fat
to go with the meat.

12:57.700 --> 13:01.400
The really critical thing
is to get a moose
with a lot of fat on it.

13:01.433 --> 13:05.133
This is the time of year
when the moose are mating
and bull moose stop eating.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.167
And every day that passes,

13:07.200 --> 13:08.867
the longer it takes me
to get a moose,

13:08.900 --> 13:10.767
the leaner
that moose is likely to be.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.633
This magazine
holds four rounds,

13:18.067 --> 13:20.633
but if everything goes right,

13:20.667 --> 13:23.067
it's only gonna
take one to kill a moose.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.100
When I pull the trigger
and that moose drops,

13:29.133 --> 13:31.067
that's six months
food right there.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.167
(WHISPERING)
I have to be really careful
not to make noise.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.367
More often than not
I've detected moose

13:37.400 --> 13:40.600
by ear
rather than by seeing them.

13:45.567 --> 13:49.400
A lot of times, it takes
10 days to find a moose

13:49.433 --> 13:51.333
before I get
a good shot at one.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.900
So I just have to be
patient and pace myself.

13:55.933 --> 13:59.100
Keep my energy going
so that I can get a moose

13:59.133 --> 14:02.067
and I'd have energy left
to get the moose home.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.067
I just heard a moose.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.233
I just heard a moose
over this way.

14:13.633 --> 14:15.733
I gotta get across
this wet area

14:15.767 --> 14:17.533
before I can start calling.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.600
Once I get on the other side
of the water,

14:19.633 --> 14:21.933
I'll try to get him
on good ground.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.433
If I kill him
in this wet spot,

14:23.467 --> 14:26.300
it would be a disaster
trying to get him out of here.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.633
Hunting on foot I can't cover
nearly as much territory

14:31.667 --> 14:33.467
as if I had a motorboat,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.267
or I was in an area
where I was using
a four-wheeler.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.433
I see a big moose.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.567
I can't tell
if it's a cow or bull.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.767
I can't see the head yet.
I can't see the antlers.

14:53.733 --> 14:56.733
It's a cow and a bull.
I can only shoot bulls.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.667
If I can get that bull,
it's gonna be worth
dragging it down from here,

14:59.700 --> 15:01.567
but I can't go much further.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.067
(MIMICS MOOSE CALL)

15:20.567 --> 15:23.300
They keep moving further away
from me into the forest,

15:23.333 --> 15:25.433
further and further
away from the lake.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.633
And I really need to get them
close to the lake
so I can get him home.

15:30.467 --> 15:33.800
The bull's
right behind the cow.
I can't shoot right now.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.300
It moved.

15:48.333 --> 15:52.067
It takes days walking around
to find a moose.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.100
Then you gotta get
close enough to it.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.433
I'm just getting way
too far away from the lake.

15:57.467 --> 15:59.400
If I had to move a moose
from here all the way down,

15:59.433 --> 16:03.067
I'd have my hands full.
It would take me a few days
probably to get it home.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.733
So I've pretty much
given up on this one.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.733
It's a beautiful moose.
That's too bad.

16:08.733 --> 16:10.533
It's just a beautiful bull.

16:13.133 --> 16:16.967
Every year
that I've been out here,
I've always gotten a moose.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.367
And it's always scary

16:18.400 --> 16:21.367
because there's always
the chance I don't get one.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.700
And if I don't get a moose,

16:22.733 --> 16:25.067
it would be really hard
for me to live out here.

16:28.467 --> 16:33.300
SUE: I live dynamically close
to my environment.

16:34.933 --> 16:38.733
It's right up my backside
and I'm crawling on top of it.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.600
So we better be
able to get along,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.200
say "sorry" when we do
something wrong,

16:42.233 --> 16:44.300
and "thank you"
when it goes right.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.767
I've been riding the ridge
a little bit so I can
get a good look over.

16:52.800 --> 16:58.267
Now I wanna just drop in
and follow it
and see what I see.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.233
See if there's
a good, little campy spot.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.667
See if I like the setup.
Am I seeing sign?

17:02.700 --> 17:05.067
If not,
I'll go towards the river.

17:05.067 --> 17:09.433
All's you can do is check
it out, and throw the dart,
and hope for the best.

NARRATOR: With winter
on the horizon,

17:11.333 --> 17:15.467
Sue Aikens is on a quest
to secure food
for the long months ahead.

17:23.467 --> 17:26.533
SUE: I got a nice little
valley that might funnel
some animals in.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.733
They can come
down this valley,

17:29.767 --> 17:32.067
down that valley,

17:32.100 --> 17:35.800
up this one,
or down that one.

17:35.833 --> 17:39.067
I mean, it's as good a shot
as any. I say I set up camp.

17:40.833 --> 17:43.200
When it gets dark out here,

17:44.900 --> 17:47.633
you definitely
feel vulnerable.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.067
Expect it to be a pretty
brutal year with the bears.

NARRATOR: Living by herself,
hundreds of miles from
the nearest hospital,

17:54.700 --> 17:58.600
Sue must protect herself
from the region's
many apex predators.

18:00.433 --> 18:03.700
SUE: This is going to be
some bear fencing.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.167
I'll get it to go
around a few times

18:07.200 --> 18:10.633
and then you hook up the
battery to it and some leads,

18:10.667 --> 18:13.067
and zap!

18:13.100 --> 18:16.900
A little bear tries to make
a snack out of Suzie,
he's gonna get macked.

18:16.933 --> 18:20.400
Sometimes all's you need
is a couple of seconds
to get yourself ready.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.933
ANDY: Alaskans are
very unique people.

18:27.967 --> 18:31.800
We're all very independent,
especially people
living out in the bush.

We're all very inventive,

care of themselves.

NARRATOR:
Andy and Kate must get
their fish wheel in the water,

18:51.133 --> 18:54.267
or risk missing
their opportunity for salmon.

18:56.967 --> 19:00.400
-ANDY: Let's flip this over
so that the boards are up.
-Yep.

19:00.433 --> 19:03.200
When fall hits,
it's the crunch time.

19:05.433 --> 19:09.267
And we've gotta get
everything done before
that snow flies.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.900
There's no time to stop.
There's no time to rest.

19:14.933 --> 19:17.233
There's hardly time
to take a breath.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.500
It's always very
nerve-racking for me
putting the fish wheel in.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.500
The last thing I want is,

19:27.533 --> 19:29.767
the day I wanna go fishing,
to break my wheel
putting it in

19:29.800 --> 19:32.733
and then spend three or four
days trying to fix something.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.333
All right.
Ready to go fishing now!

19:41.433 --> 19:44.867
The fall chum have a very
short cycle of really up

19:44.900 --> 19:47.800
and really down.
And when they're up,
they're up really good.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.400
When they're down,
they crash, there's nothing.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.733
Son of a bitch!

19:53.767 --> 19:55.433
That's turning too fast.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.500
Whoo, baby, there's a lot
of current there.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.667
We have to bring it in
quite a bit.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.600
That's turning
almost too fast.

20:12.633 --> 20:14.400
Let's bring it in some.

20:14.433 --> 20:18.200
I feel like the current's
a lot faster here this year
than it was last year.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.400
So we don't have to
have as long of a spar.

20:20.433 --> 20:22.433
We don't have to have
as long of a lead.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.000
Generally, I like somewhere
between five and six
rotations a minute.

20:30.233 --> 20:34.633
So one full rotation
about every 10 seconds.

20:34.667 --> 20:38.767
That keeps one basket of
the wheel in the water fishing
almost all of the time.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.933
What we want is we want those
baskets to be coming down

20:42.967 --> 20:44.933
and just barely digging a hole
into the gravel.

20:44.967 --> 20:48.267
And that makes a place
to where the fish can't go
underneath the wheel.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.433
So if it can slowly
dig a hole for itself,

20:54.467 --> 20:57.633
that increases the efficiency
of the wheel dramatically.

21:01.967 --> 21:03.700
That's about where we want it.

21:03.733 --> 21:04.933
KATE: Whoo-hoo!

21:04.967 --> 21:06.600
Seems to be
turning really good

21:06.633 --> 21:09.333
and touching bottom
and not going too fast.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.600
So it looks like
we found our spot.

Here, fishy, fishy, fishy!

21:15.633 --> 21:18.400
It's a crapshoot. We have
no idea what's going on

21:18.433 --> 21:21.433
other than I know there are
fish coming up. How many?

21:21.467 --> 21:23.300
I guess
tomorrow morning will tell.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.133
There we go!

21:26.167 --> 21:29.067
-First fish!
-Looks like a nice one!

21:29.067 --> 21:31.533
I'm very excited
we got our fish wheel in,

21:31.567 --> 21:33.067
and it's going
and it's catching,

21:33.067 --> 21:35.833
and it went in
as smooth as silk.

21:35.867 --> 21:38.500

Tomorrow it would be great
if we had maybe 100 fish.

start for us.

dragging it on a sled

there's no breaking
your equipment.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.600
We have really
small trees up here
because it's the Arctic

22:17.633 --> 22:19.733

growing season.

22:19.767 --> 22:23.167
And we have
real long winters and then
we have real deep cold.

22:27.833 --> 22:30.133
Even though it's hard work,
I enjoy doing this

22:30.167 --> 22:32.067

22:32.067 --> 22:34.967

Getting materials
from the land,
the things you need.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.433
It's always important
to have a cache in places
that you wanna frequent.

23:08.467 --> 23:11.067
You do need to have places
to keep your things dry.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.500
You need to keep
yourself dry sometimes.

23:12.533 --> 23:14.833
So as an emergency back-up
I could walk inside the cache

23:14.867 --> 23:17.200

to sleep here on the floor."

more than once.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.667
and on the bottom,
I have it notched like that.

23:24.700 --> 23:28.267
So when they rest,
they'll rest like that
upon each other.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.733
I'm gonna split
this one in half so that
it has a flat half,

23:30.767 --> 23:32.800
that will meet my flat floor
and my flat beams

so I can stack the logs up
on top of it.

25:24.833 --> 25:28.433
to be connected to the land,
to get the resources
from the land.

25:28.467 --> 25:30.467
And that's what's
important to me.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.167
You untie and I'll drive.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.767
We're gonna go check
the wheel for a second day,

25:47.800 --> 25:50.567
see what we get.
We're hoping it's not
too many fish.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.367
We still wanna put up
a few more fish for ourselves.

25:55.700 --> 25:59.067
It's very time-consuming to
cut them for human consumption

25:59.100 --> 26:00.500
to do it right.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.833
Scoring them.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.467
There's a lot of work that
goes into brining them,

26:07.500 --> 26:10.433
getting them ready
to go into the smoker.

26:10.467 --> 26:13.233
If we get females,
we'll probably smoke some eggs

26:13.267 --> 26:14.733
so we have some caviar.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.067
All of that
takes a lot of time,

26:18.100 --> 26:20.300
so 100, 150 fish
would be great,

26:20.333 --> 26:24.333
it could be really bad news
if we pull up and the boxes
are overflowing with fish.

26:24.367 --> 26:26.500
'Cause I don't want to
have to deal with 400 fish.

26:26.533 --> 26:29.067
It'd be really nice
to deal with maybe 100 fish.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.633
We can focus
on cutting, and drying,

26:30.667 --> 26:32.867
and smoking some of the fish
that we want.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.800
And it won't take me long to
put up 100 fish for the dogs.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.133
That's nothing for us.

26:37.167 --> 26:39.100
I guess we're gonna
find out here real quick.

26:42.733 --> 26:43.733
Uh-oh.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.333
We're probably close to 300.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.367
It looks like we got
our work cut out for us today.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.467
Definitely would much rather
have a few less fish,

26:57.067 --> 26:58.600
but better too much than none.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.100
(ANDY SPEAKING)

27:03.933 --> 27:07.433
(CHUCKLES)
I think from here on out
it's gonna be slam bam.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.300
We got a lot of fish today.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.167
Kind of like
an Easter egg hunt.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.500
You show up with your wheel
and you see how many eggs
you got in the basket.

27:20.533 --> 27:23.067
That's the way
every day is out here.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.600
We've got 200 fish.

27:32.633 --> 27:37.267
They probably average
right around
seven pounds apiece.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.567
That's not a half bad
looking fish right there.

27:40.633 --> 27:41.800
Huh.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.433
Keeper.

27:43.467 --> 27:45.067
ANDY: All in all,
things are going pretty good.

27:45.067 --> 27:48.467
It's a little more work than
I really wanted to do today.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.633
By the time I cut
these fish and then clean
the fish for ourselves,

27:52.667 --> 27:56.900
I think I'm gonna be
a sore little puppy
by the end of the evening.

27:56.933 --> 28:01.167
I'm not complaining.
I'd much rather have the fish
than not have the fish.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.300
It's all about a economy

28:04.500 --> 28:06.700
of your time and energy
out here.

28:06.733 --> 28:07.933
There's so much to do,

28:07.967 --> 28:10.567
it's really important that
what you spend your time on

28:10.600 --> 28:12.667
is done efficiently
and cost effectively.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.833
That's why I've always been
a fish wheel fisherman.

28:14.867 --> 28:18.633
For us, it's a really
efficient way to put up food.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.533
KATE: Okay, well,
you've got 30 done.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.533
You have about 160 to go.

28:23.567 --> 28:24.567
(CHUCKLES)

28:29.467 --> 28:31.667
GLENN: For me,

28:31.700 --> 28:35.533
living involves hunting
and killing in order to live.

28:35.567 --> 28:37.233
It's the natural cycle.

28:37.267 --> 28:38.800
Part of the cycle
of life and death,

28:38.833 --> 28:41.400
and I'm participating in it
every day out here.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.633
(WHISPERING) It's my fifth day
hunting moose now,

29:03.633 --> 29:05.100
and I'm over in an area

29:05.133 --> 29:06.900
that I know is a good spot

29:06.933 --> 29:08.433
for a moose
at this time of year.

29:08.467 --> 29:11.367
I'm gonna move down
in here carefully this morning

29:11.400 --> 29:13.400
and see if I can find
a bull moose.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.967
Living up here
in the Arctic in the winter,

29:26.067 --> 29:28.267
it takes a lot of energy,
it takes a lot of food.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.900
I eat a lot.
I eat about three pounds
of meat every day.

29:30.933 --> 29:35.200
Meat and fat.
That's what sustains me
in the cold weather.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.300
(GLENN SPEAKING)

29:42.900 --> 29:45.167
(MIMICS MOOSE CALL)

30:02.900 --> 30:04.300
Here he comes.

30:07.667 --> 30:10.833
See, he's waving his antlers
at me just like this.

30:10.867 --> 30:13.633
He thinks
I'm a moose right now.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.367
He's coming to fight me.
Look, he's got a cow
over there.

30:28.633 --> 30:31.400
He doesn't want me
mating with that cow.

30:31.433 --> 30:33.433
He wants that cow for himself.

30:33.467 --> 30:36.267
He's gonna go out
in that open field, I hope.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.433
I just gotta get
lined up for the shot.

31:05.433 --> 31:06.767
(GUNSHOT)

31:07.967 --> 31:09.233
I got him.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.167
I got him. He's down.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.200
That's a nice
looking bull, too.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.433
There goes the cow
that was with him.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.300
She's out of here now.
She's in oestrous.
She's mooing and mooing.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.633
She's wanting to get bred and

31:29.667 --> 31:33.567
he thinks
that I'm another bull
coming to take his cow.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.800
He doesn't want that.
So he came over here to fight.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.700
He was over here
to chase me off.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.267
This is the fifth day
looking for a moose.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.267
I've walked about
25 miles looking for this
moose around the lake.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.333
It's dead.

32:05.933 --> 32:07.933
If I had
very little else to eat,

32:07.967 --> 32:12.067
just this moose here
would feed me
for almost six months.

32:12.067 --> 32:14.867
It's really
an important moment for me
to get a moose like this.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.267
It was a lot of work,

32:16.300 --> 32:18.867
but I got him and I got
six months food right here.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.100
It's a good moment for me.
I would rather live this way

32:22.133 --> 32:25.100
by hunting than by
buying my food in a store.

32:25.133 --> 32:28.067
That's the way
I live out here.
It's the natural cycle.

32:31.433 --> 32:33.800
CHIP: We never had
no big dreams for big houses.

32:33.833 --> 32:35.733
We treat this like a camp.

32:35.767 --> 32:38.833
It's a place where we can
take shelter, we can eat,
we can see our family.

32:38.867 --> 32:40.200
It's pretty nice.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.167
It's coming together.
It's good.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.733
I just got a few more logs
to add here.

33:01.767 --> 33:03.167
Maybe four more on here.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.100
NARRATOR: In order to store
and preserve the meat

33:05.133 --> 33:07.667
from the Hailstone's
upcoming caribou hunt,

33:07.700 --> 33:11.333
Chip is putting
the finishing touches
on the family's new cache.

33:11.367 --> 33:13.733
The roof will be
cross-beamed like this.

33:13.767 --> 33:15.167
And I'll put up
several of them

33:15.200 --> 33:17.800
and then probably run a pole
underneath 'em for support,

33:17.833 --> 33:20.400
and then I'll put plywood.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.433
The only thing I'm lacking
is sheets of plywood.

33:24.167 --> 33:28.233
NARRATOR: In Noorvik,
the Hailstones rely on trading
within the community

33:28.267 --> 33:31.067
to support their
subsistence lifestyle.

33:31.067 --> 33:32.667
We're almost quite done
with our cache

33:32.700 --> 33:36.700
but we need a few plyboards.
So I'm just gonna walk around.

33:36.733 --> 33:38.467
My neighbour have
some plyboards here

33:38.500 --> 33:40.400
and I might have something
that he would like.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.900
And so I was just
gonna go ask him

33:42.933 --> 33:48.367
if he'd like to trade
or if I could buy some
of his plyboards.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.333
-Yeah, good to see you again.
-Yep.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.633
I noticed you have
a lot of plyboards.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.533
Yep. This would be perfect.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.667
Wow, these are nice.
Are you willing to trade?

33:56.700 --> 33:59.200
What would you have
to trade for these?

33:59.233 --> 34:01.267
I got 10 gallons of gas.

34:02.467 --> 34:03.800
-10 gallons of gas.
-Yeah.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.900
-Okay, good deal. Awesome.
-Yeah, good deal right there.

34:05.933 --> 34:07.400
-These are perfect.
-Good. Yep.

34:07.433 --> 34:08.600
AGNES: Score.

34:08.633 --> 34:12.533
Those boards are like
$120 apiece boards
right there,

34:12.567 --> 34:16.133
and for four of them,
and he's not using them,

34:16.167 --> 34:19.167
and he needs gas
and I need boards.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.833
So it's a good trade
for the both of us.

34:21.867 --> 34:26.800
I'm gonna go tell him
the boards I traded
for his gas.

34:26.833 --> 34:29.200
And I have to go
ask him for his gas now.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.500
SUE: It's a calculated risk
every time you step
out the door.

34:38.967 --> 34:41.067
There's no guarantees
in anything.

34:41.067 --> 34:43.733
The only guarantee is it's
a limited time engagement.

34:43.767 --> 34:46.333
So why not pack it
full of experiences?

34:55.800 --> 34:58.067
Got a big rain system
coming in

34:58.067 --> 35:00.667
and that will just
damage the hunting.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.133
My visibility goes down to nil

35:04.167 --> 35:07.533
and the animals are just
gonna find some hole
and hunker down.

35:07.567 --> 35:08.600
I'm looking for anything

35:08.633 --> 35:10.933
that's gonna provide meat
that's legal.

35:10.967 --> 35:12.433
They're all on the menu.

35:12.467 --> 35:15.300
But I need to get there,
get closer,
and get the good visual.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.567
There they are.

35:19.533 --> 35:20.733
Where are they going?

35:24.167 --> 35:25.567
They call them ghosts
of the tundra.

35:25.600 --> 35:30.067
And what that means is they're
using the geographic features,

35:30.067 --> 35:32.067
the dips and swales,

35:32.067 --> 35:34.067
and they'll travel
around in them,

35:34.067 --> 35:35.633
and then all of a sudden
they're on high ground.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.767
So for the human eye,
you're looking and,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.433
"Oh, where'd they come from?"
They're just standing out
in the middle of the field.

35:41.467 --> 35:43.733
What you don't know
is that there's a little
dip they travelled.

35:43.767 --> 35:47.333
And then you go, "Oh, okay,"
you reach for your gun and,
"Where'd they go?"

35:47.367 --> 35:48.367
They're gone.

35:49.867 --> 35:52.467
Now I'm gonna do
the same thing that they do.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.367
I'm trying to keep
the geographical feature

35:54.400 --> 35:55.667
in between the two of us.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.300
So I'm turning
the tables on it.

35:57.333 --> 36:00.500
They use it to hide
and pop up and down,

36:00.533 --> 36:02.600
I'm using it to hide
and pop up and down.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.467
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

36:05.500 --> 36:07.100
This is the game trail.

36:11.100 --> 36:14.400
Bear. We've got
bear and caribou.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.200
I know
they came through this way.

36:21.933 --> 36:24.067
Shit. Okay. Shh.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.067
All right, I see one.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.467
Okay, she just made me.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.133
I can't really get...

36:33.167 --> 36:35.267
Looks to be 200-300 yards.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.367
I've gotta take myself
out of the brush.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:44.233 --> 36:46.467
All right. Come on,
come on, baby, come on, baby.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.267
(GUNSHOT)

37:04.933 --> 37:06.533
One down.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.067
I picked it right.

37:08.067 --> 37:10.800
There was bear tracks,
wolf tracks, caribou tracks,
moose tracks.

37:10.833 --> 37:14.633
This is definitely
the confluence
where you're funnelling.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.067
Now time to go see what I got.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.833
I've gotta go
retrieve the meat

37:19.867 --> 37:23.633
before some of the predators
decide to relieve me
of the responsibility.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.400
I've got a big old storm
coming in.

37:26.433 --> 37:30.400
The forecast is, keep dropping
in temperature and snow.

37:30.433 --> 37:32.967
This time of year I can get
three foot of snow

37:33.067 --> 37:34.267
in no time flat.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.667
Winter is breathing down
my neck.

37:38.933 --> 37:42.567
Right now it's going
slate grey, which this time
of year means snow.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.100
I can trap myself out here,
so I wanna get
this done quickly.

37:48.867 --> 37:52.633
Very first caribou that I got,
I was maybe 12 or so.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.400
Different things happened
in my younger life

37:56.433 --> 37:59.100
and left me
kind of raising myself

37:59.133 --> 38:01.700
and being alone
out in the wilderness
of Alaska.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.900
Bus driver handed me
a gun and said,

38:05.933 --> 38:08.667
"You don't learn to shoot,
you're not gonna be here.
Figure it out."

38:09.900 --> 38:11.933
I got a handful of bullets,

38:11.967 --> 38:13.467
I was pretty hungry.
I was pretty cold.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.100
Here comes this animal
and I first thought of Santa,

38:18.133 --> 38:20.233
you know,
and I was pretty star-struck,

38:21.300 --> 38:23.100
and then my belly rumbled.

38:24.467 --> 38:25.467
I took it down,

38:26.267 --> 38:27.633
and it was a harsh reality.

38:28.867 --> 38:30.367
It's, kind of,
a full circle moment.

38:31.967 --> 38:33.133
Thank you.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.333
Taking the first life,
and being grateful,

38:35.367 --> 38:37.633
and not being hungry any more,

38:37.667 --> 38:39.300
to being better at it,

38:39.333 --> 38:43.400
still being grateful
that I won't be hungry
this winter.

38:43.433 --> 38:45.933
I've been down here a little
while working on this.

38:45.967 --> 38:48.900
There's no predator
within 10 miles
that doesn't know it's here,

38:48.933 --> 38:50.133
so they're gonna be coming in.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.400
So I wanna get out.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.233
Temperature went down,
it's come up again.

39:00.267 --> 39:02.733
Just looks
really unpredictable.

39:02.767 --> 39:06.100
I know I'm in bear territory
and I'm gonna add snow, fog,

39:06.133 --> 39:10.367
and everything else in on it,
it's not a particularly safe,
secure feeling.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.867
For me to stay here,
it's really gotta pay off.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.633
I'm not seeing the numbers
of caribou that say,

39:16.667 --> 39:17.900
"Yeah, take another day."

39:17.933 --> 39:20.600
What if I get stuck out here
a week and can't get in?

39:20.633 --> 39:24.167
It's time to wrap this portion
of the trip up.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.133
You know,
live to hunt another day.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.633
CHIP: This is a place
that you can take your kids

39:29.667 --> 39:31.467
and say, "Hey, look, this is
how to have a good time.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.267
"This is a place
where there's days
of high adventure.

39:34.300 --> 39:36.800
"And a lot of other people
are jealous."

39:53.600 --> 39:56.233
I think I got
that one on straight.

39:56.267 --> 39:58.500
I notched the tops
and then joined them together,

39:58.533 --> 40:00.767
and then I put a cross piece
into each one

40:00.800 --> 40:03.367
just to hold them in place
'cause I'm working by myself.

40:03.867 --> 40:05.267
I'm almost done.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.567
AGNES: Wow!
CHIP: You liking that?

40:16.600 --> 40:21.600
Gee whiz! That's a lot
since I left earlier. Cool!

40:21.633 --> 40:24.267
The caribous are starting
to move so it's real important

40:24.300 --> 40:26.700
that we get this
cache done today.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.667
Because if we don't
get this cache done,

40:28.700 --> 40:31.300
then we're not gonna have
a place to store our meats.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.100
CHIP: We got four sheets
of plywood over here

40:37.133 --> 40:38.567
that my wife traded
the neighbour for,

40:38.600 --> 40:40.400
and I'm gonna
put them up on the roof.

40:41.667 --> 40:43.633
What isn't forgotten
and what's still very viable

40:43.667 --> 40:47.133
is gathering stuff
for yourself,
building stuff for yourself.

40:47.167 --> 40:48.833
This stuff is never outdated

40:48.867 --> 40:50.100
no matter what
my technology would be.

40:50.133 --> 40:52.067
If I was cutting these logs
with laser beams,

40:52.100 --> 40:53.867
I'd still end up
with a log cache.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.300
Someday the girls will come
and look at this and say,

40:56.333 --> 41:00.500
-"Hey, look, this is how
my mum and dad did it."
-CHIP: Yep.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.233
-I'm sure you'll get
all the credit.
-(AGNES LAUGHS)

41:05.067 --> 41:07.833
AGNES: This is so cool.

41:07.867 --> 41:10.233
CHIP: I used basically what
I could go out and go gather

41:10.267 --> 41:12.133
to keep it the cheapest.

41:12.167 --> 41:14.800
My wife traded gasoline off
for sheets of plywood,

41:14.833 --> 41:18.067
and I bought a couple pounds
of nails for, like, 10 bucks.

41:19.933 --> 41:23.433
I would say, in the end,
it probably cost us
less than $100.

41:23.467 --> 41:26.067
And of course,
about three days of my time.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.433
I'm gonna have
to put you a step here.

41:30.167 --> 41:31.600
Here you go, woman.

41:32.367 --> 41:33.633
It's all yours.

41:33.667 --> 41:35.767
AGNES: You used 35 logs.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.367
-CHIP: Cool.
-And only six of them
are halves.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.967
And it's real easy for me
to go in and out of there.

41:41.067 --> 41:42.633
It's your size.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.233
So that should help things.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.700
Hey, babe, how do you like it?

41:51.767 --> 41:55.067
It's awesome.
You could go in and peek.

41:55.567 --> 41:57.100
(GIGGLES)

41:57.133 --> 41:59.767
CHIP: Who knows, Mary,
someday it might
even be yours.

42:03.067 --> 42:05.267
We might be old,
and gone, and dead

42:05.300 --> 42:06.967
and you might be an old lady

42:07.067 --> 42:09.433
and telling your kids,
"My dad built that."

42:10.933 --> 42:12.067
Go ahead, have fun.

42:12.067 --> 42:13.800
(QUTAN SPEAKING)

42:13.833 --> 42:16.067
(GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

42:16.067 --> 42:17.667
CAROL: Try and go on this one.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.767
MARY:
Got to go like this, Qutan.
Put your arms the other way.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.067
CAROL: Qutan?

42:21.067 --> 42:22.500
CHIP: This right here
could last long enough

42:22.533 --> 42:24.533
that my daughters could be
using this when they grow up.

42:24.567 --> 42:27.467
CAROL: Oh, I joke.
QUTAN: So close!

42:27.500 --> 42:29.900
I just gotta go work,
and take the kids,

42:29.933 --> 42:33.633
and go upriver
and spend a couple days
doing our caribou hunt.

42:33.667 --> 42:35.833
And then come back
and go fill it up.

42:35.867 --> 42:37.267
CHIP: Is that a perfect door?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.600
-Is that big enough
to get through?
-CAROL: Yeah.

42:39.833 --> 42:42.400
Sun's just about down
and I'm tired.

42:42.433 --> 42:43.967
-Me too.
-It's time to give it up.

42:44.067 --> 42:45.200
-Love you, Mum.
-Love you.

42:45.233 --> 42:47.533
Love you. Have fun.

42:47.567 --> 42:48.900
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.100
-It's all good.
-You're awesome.

42:51.133 --> 42:54.067
-So are you.
That's why I make 'em.
-Saw dusty and awesome.
