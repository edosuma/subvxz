00:02.315 --> 00:04.449
Irena Barstow and Roman Barstow.

00:04.484 --> 00:07.686
Their bodies were recovered from
Trout Lake yesterday morning.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.687
Randall Wishart?

00:08.721 --> 00:10.622
Can you tell us where
you were two nights ago?

00:10.657 --> 00:12.457
Uh, I was at my buddy Troy's place.

00:12.492 --> 00:15.093
Randall, he killed two people.

00:15.128 --> 00:16.195
I saw him at school today.

00:16.229 --> 00:18.664
Randall, he has my phone.

00:18.698 --> 00:20.499
I'll-I'll figure something out.

00:20.533 --> 00:22.034
This is a message for Detective Delorme.

00:22.068 --> 00:24.703
What kind of person writes and sends

00:24.737 --> 00:26.004
that kind of card?

00:26.039 --> 00:27.839
You think this person
had something to do with

00:27.874 --> 00:28.840
Catherine's death.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.166
Everyone you've put behind bars

00:30.201 --> 00:31.380
going back to 2010.

00:31.415 --> 00:32.778
I appreciate your discretion.

00:32.812 --> 00:35.647
Fancy couple got murdered
up on, uh, Island Road,

00:35.682 --> 00:37.282
dumped in the lake.

00:37.317 --> 00:38.784
Henry.

00:38.818 --> 00:40.357
It's okay, it's late.

00:40.753 --> 00:42.540
I can start the fire myself.

00:42.574 --> 00:43.893
- You sure?
- Yeah.

Three different ATMs,

Stop! Are you okay?

00:51.698 --> 00:52.870
You forget something?

Who are you?

Lets all just settle in.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.111

I said to give us what we
wanted or I'd kill her.

Hey. You're home.

05:23.970 --> 05:24.903
Yeah.

05:24.937 --> 05:26.438
It's Thanksgiving weekend.

05:28.441 --> 05:29.574
You didn't remember.

05:29.609 --> 05:31.109
No, I didn't, I didn't.

- I didn't forget.
- Sure.

Cold case files.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.831
The Scrivers?

05:48.895 --> 05:52.030

story when I was a kid.

05:52.632 --> 05:53.999
They never found them, right?

05:54.033 --> 05:55.964
No, no, they never did.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.138
Murder, missing, murder.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.140
Yeah I can see how this
would cheer you up.

06:02.174 --> 06:04.890
You shouldn't really be
looking at that stuff.

06:08.648 --> 06:10.148
Why do you have this?

06:12.818 --> 06:15.192
Because Lise returned
your mother's effects.

06:16.489 --> 06:18.023
You shouldn't keep that, dad.

06:18.991 --> 06:21.246
And we should really think about
giving some of her stuff away.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.532
Yeah, well,

06:23.095 --> 06:25.314
first we have to pick out some photos

06:25.348 --> 06:27.048

Okay. Let's do it this weekend, then.

06:31.404 --> 06:33.927
Alright. Just, not now.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.140
I have to go to work.

06:35.174 --> 06:37.054

06:58.531 --> 07:00.065
Missed you this morning.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.535
I was up late looking at the case.

07:03.569 --> 07:05.909
Any luck with the Barstow's rental car?

07:07.106 --> 07:08.106
No.

07:09.775 --> 07:11.309
Not easy being the boss.

07:12.545 --> 07:13.912
It's fine.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.080
Come inside.

07:15.114 --> 07:17.115
I want to talk about Randall Wishart.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.091
So Randall hasn't come in.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.740
But still you don't think he's our guy.

07:27.774 --> 07:32.130
No. But we both know he's lying.

07:32.164 --> 07:33.565
So the young woman at the house,

07:33.599 --> 07:35.033
you think she was there for him?

07:35.067 --> 07:36.510
You're a married realtor,

07:36.545 --> 07:39.137
an empty house is a good
place to take your mistress.

07:40.006 --> 07:41.760
So the prints on the headboard are his.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.197
And the blue fibre, maybe they
put something down on the bed.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.118
Okay, so he meets this woman for sex.

07:46.145 --> 07:47.111
He leaves,

07:47.146 --> 07:49.080
she stays for some reason,

07:49.114 --> 07:50.949
and then hell breaks loose downstairs.

07:50.983 --> 07:54.919
It would explain why she
hasn't come forward.

07:54.954 --> 07:56.588
She's protecting him.

07:56.622 --> 07:58.423
And he's letting her,

07:58.457 --> 08:00.630
even though she's risking her life.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.201
What are you doing here?

08:10.236 --> 08:11.369
You wouldn't see me any other way.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.704
Look, I don't want it to be this way.

08:12.738 --> 08:14.372
But I'm trying to protect us, both of us.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.607
The cops have already been here.

08:15.641 --> 08:17.939
We need to tell them what happened.

08:18.978 --> 08:21.359
This is my life, Sam.

08:23.015 --> 08:24.315
Two people are dead.

08:24.350 --> 08:26.150
What about them?

08:26.185 --> 08:27.719
We can't change that.

08:29.755 --> 08:31.256
I called the police.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.828
What did you just say?

08:36.861 --> 08:38.196
It was anonymous.

08:38.230 --> 08:39.753
I used a pay phone.

08:40.399 --> 08:41.832
Well you didn't see anything.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.868
What can that possibly do but hurt us?

08:47.606 --> 08:49.407
Hey, hey, hey.

08:52.278 --> 08:53.645
We're gonna be together.

08:53.679 --> 08:56.481
I'm gonna leave her, I promise.

08:56.515 --> 08:58.516
We just gotta get this behind us, okay?

09:00.019 --> 09:02.420
The killer, he called me.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.355
I know it was him.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.591
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened with the police.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.725
What did you tell them?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.527
Did you mention my name?

09:11.597 --> 09:12.864
No.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Okay.

09:17.269 --> 09:18.569
Go, just go.

09:18.604 --> 09:20.605
You can't be seen around here.

09:35.387 --> 09:36.888
Mama's making breakfast.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.057
I'll be right up.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.359
You shouldn't get used to all this.

09:41.393 --> 09:43.795
It's not gonna be comfortable
where we're headed.

09:44.275 --> 09:46.361
That's why I should enjoy it right now.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.400
This isn't a vacation, Nikki.

09:49.435 --> 09:51.950
You need to find a way to be useful.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.412
Where are the guns you were
supposed to get for us?

10:08.654 --> 10:11.255
You could always go back

10:11.290 --> 10:12.523
to where we found you.

10:16.328 --> 10:18.830
Giving dirty old men

Mama's not gonna
like you messing with her.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.410
Just trying to toughen her up.

10:32.444 --> 10:34.200
It's not your place.

10:36.982 --> 10:39.247
At least I'm not in love with her.

10:42.321 --> 10:43.554
Jack.

10:51.463 --> 10:53.531
Detectives, hi.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.866

10:54.900 --> 10:56.973

10:59.638 --> 11:01.039
You can come with us now.

11:01.073 --> 11:04.976
Now, uh, now is not great for me.

11:05.010 --> 11:06.044
Oh.

11:06.078 --> 11:08.546
Should we go ask your boss,
Ms. Carnwright,

11:08.580 --> 11:10.581

11:11.483 --> 11:12.650

11:20.392 --> 11:23.161
Uh, we have your fingerprints

Ensuite bathroom sink.

11:26.498 --> 11:27.887

11:27.921 --> 11:29.367
Mmm. A lot of prints there.

11:29.401 --> 11:30.668
Yep.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.970
He adjusted the headboard
for a showing weeks ago.

11:33.005 --> 11:34.338
He used the bathroom.

11:34.373 --> 11:36.374

those tires out there.

- He's not scared of her.

He loves her.

13:58.592 --> 14:00.660
Loves her like she was his real mom.

14:00.695 --> 14:02.825
She's better than his real mom.

14:03.397 --> 14:04.577

The way she said 'white man'.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.892
Well if she lives on the reserve,
the chances are pretty good

No.

16:39.787 --> 16:41.521
No, no not really.

19:43.804 --> 19:45.772

19:45.806 --> 19:46.806
you know?

19:47.808 --> 19:49.275

19:49.309 --> 19:51.424

19:53.981 --> 19:55.882
Hey, maybe I can give you her name

19:55.916 --> 19:57.784
and you can give me the locker number?

19:57.818 --> 19:59.619
I can't give you that information.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.642
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

20:09.683 --> 20:11.818
What did you say your name was again?

20:11.932 --> 20:13.433
It doesn't matter.

20:14.134 --> 20:15.902
I hope this isn't weird but,

20:18.005 --> 20:19.572

32:07.105 --> 32:09.440
So are you going to be there,

32:09.869 --> 32:11.580
or are you going to be in jail?

32:13.638 --> 32:15.072
I want

32:15.097 --> 32:18.032
to be able to look my son in the eyes

32:18.250 --> 32:21.051
and tell him someone
paid for what they did.

32:21.086 --> 32:22.319
I know.

32:25.757 --> 32:27.258
I'll drive you home.

32:28.627 --> 32:29.927
Okay?

32:44.175 --> 32:45.175
Cardinal,

32:46.511 --> 32:47.778
in my office.

32:48.313 --> 32:50.327
You want to tell me
about Neil Codwallader?

32:51.616 --> 32:52.850
Not really.

32:53.691 --> 32:55.458
What is it, what are you doing?

32:57.389 --> 33:00.024
I had reason to believe
that Mr. Codwallader

33:00.058 --> 33:03.423
was involved in criminal harassment.

33:04.195 --> 33:06.426
I heard you got some nasty cards.

33:06.971 --> 33:10.139
But you cannot open up an investigation

33:10.164 --> 33:11.731
all by yourself, John,

33:11.756 --> 33:12.890
no matter how much you're hurting.

33:12.915 --> 33:15.101
Especially one involving your own wife.

33:16.955 --> 33:18.255
Other things have come to light.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.689
Other things.

33:21.146 --> 33:23.180
I don't believe she killed herself.

33:27.185 --> 33:29.186
You could've come to me.

33:30.755 --> 33:32.222
I'm there, John.

33:32.257 --> 33:33.791
This isn't like with your sister.

33:33.825 --> 33:34.792
Catherine wasn't sick.

33:34.826 --> 33:37.027
Yes she was.

33:37.062 --> 33:38.362
You knew she was.

33:42.113 --> 33:44.147
Did she know about this?

33:47.672 --> 33:48.906
About what?

33:49.708 --> 33:53.243
Your partner accused a parolee today

33:53.278 --> 33:56.142
of harassment over Catherine's death.

34:00.051 --> 34:01.285

34:08.426 --> 34:10.226
Will you excuse us, please?

34:24.476 --> 34:26.443
Well you know how he gets.

34:26.478 --> 34:28.178
He's not gonna let this go.

34:28.213 --> 34:29.246
And if it comes out,

34:29.280 --> 34:31.215
every-every single
case that he has touched

34:31.248 --> 34:32.679
is gonna be in jeopardy.

34:37.554 --> 34:41.025

We found the bodies

34:42.393 --> 34:44.395
when we did because of him.

34:47.665 --> 34:49.800
This is just his way of coping.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.335
Well, it's gotta stop.

34:52.237 --> 34:53.737
I'll talk to him.
