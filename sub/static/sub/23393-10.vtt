Hey, mopesy.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.391
You know what might make you feel better
is changing the leak bucket.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.768
Oh, no.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.438
I'm gonna need a reflective surface
to gaze sadly into later,

01:03.521 --> 01:04.980
and you won't let me have a well.

01:06.775 --> 01:10.236
Let me guess.
You're cyber-stalking Winnie again.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.364
Yes. And get this,
some guy named Chester Davenport

01:13.448 --> 01:17.118
liked a picture of Winnie and Jacob
playing Frisbee golf.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.579
Her friends sound like a-holes.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.749
You realize that's just
making you feel worse.

01:22.832 --> 01:27.837
I know. I just polished off a tub
of what I thought was cheese dip.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.590
Yeah. I know, I read your status update.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.303
-Why don't you go see your granddaughter?
-Are you kidding?

01:35.386 --> 01:39.724
Faith gets exposed to even a whiff
of my toxic negativity at her age

01:39.808 --> 01:42.185
and she is on the child-actor track.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.772
Well, you're the one that said that
breaking up was the right thing to do.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.982
I know. I know, but it's so hard to see

01:48.066 --> 01:50.985
Jacob gallivanting
around the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum

01:51.069 --> 01:53.488
like I was never even banned from there.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.324
Well, let's stop using Facebook
to torture ourselves,

01:56.407 --> 01:59.369
and use it to read
our customer testimonials.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.787
That always cheers you up.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.665
So does ramen,
but I have to really be in the mood,

02:03.748 --> 02:06.042
and the weather's been
just too warm lately.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.213
Okay, here's one from Heywood Jablomie...

02:11.506 --> 02:14.050
Okay, that's clearly Brianna.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.511
Oh, Harriet posted again.
You love Harriet!

02:16.594 --> 02:19.472
Oh, I am a fan of our biggest fan.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.308
"Ladies, greetings
from San Juan Capistrano!

02:22.392 --> 02:26.855
Just ordered a half-dozen for the gals
I did jury duty with.

02:26.938 --> 02:31.526
And a mini for the woman
who definitely robbed that bank!"

02:31.609 --> 02:34.988
Oh, God, that is classic Harriet.
Is there a new picture?

02:35.071 --> 02:37.282
Let's see. There.

02:37.365 --> 02:41.369
Oh. That's her look.
Outer space librarian.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.246
God, I love her.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.876
Hey, Frances.
What do you say we have an adventure?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.921
Are you gonna finally take me
to the world's largest Slip 'N Slide?

02:52.005 --> 02:55.550
You know what? Instead of sliding down
what smells like a giant urinal,

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
let's go see Harriet.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.262
Let's just show up at her house
and surprise her.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.597
Well, she may not be there.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.141
What if she's trapped in the mall
overnight again?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.559
We'll just wait for her.

03:04.642 --> 03:09.397
This is a good day to drive up the coast.
Go get dressed and I'll get her address.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.524
Can we bring her some freebies?

03:11.608 --> 03:16.154
We can bring her a whole gift basket
of extra Ménages and your yam lube.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.282
Can there be balloons? Vagina balloons?

03:19.365 --> 03:22.243
For the first time ever,
I'm gonna answer that question with a yes.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.453
Ah!

03:27.457 --> 03:29.959
-So, who wants to start?
-I'll start.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.086
If that's okay with you.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.922
I think that would be great.

03:34.005 --> 03:34.964
Very well.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.556
"Today, you'll hear two stories.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.267
One, clear-eyed and level-headed,

03:46.351 --> 03:49.145
the other, a jumble of too many emotions.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.397
My husband will disarm you

03:51.481 --> 03:54.359
with his welcoming eyes
and warm temperament,

03:54.442 --> 03:56.945
then distract from the facts

03:57.028 --> 03:59.489
with his loud feelings,
which are clearly--

03:59.572 --> 04:01.241
Okay, Robert. Robert.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.578
I appreciate the effort
behind your opening statement,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.830
but you're not here to win a case.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.624
Thank you.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.002
Obviously, one of us is new to therapy

04:13.086 --> 04:16.339
and needs a little guidance
in the art of self-reflection.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.341
I take responsibility.

04:18.423 --> 04:22.262
As a longtime mental-health participant,
I should have prepared him.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.055
Okay, let me stop you right here.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.557
No one is going to "win" today,

04:26.641 --> 04:29.269
and no one gets points
for having done this before.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.105
Thank you for acknowledging
that I've done this before.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.857
Just tell me straight up.

04:35.942 --> 04:36.943
Hmm?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.444
Why are you here?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.324
And thanks for the ride.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.077
I'm pretty sure the mechanic's
holding my car hostage.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.955
-Want me to handle it for you?
-That'd be great. He's mean.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.833
What time do you want me
to pick you up tonight? Dinner's at eight.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.584
Yeah...

04:54.544 --> 04:58.756
No. Another late night? Lauren is
the worst thing to happen to my sex life

04:58.840 --> 05:00.550
since my IUD fell out at that Petco.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.220
I promise she's not doing it to spite you.
We're really busy. You know?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.307
Yes, and Say Grace is busy, too. Okay?

05:07.849 --> 05:11.936
Unlike your horrible boss, I have respect
for my employees' personal lives.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.480
You fired Suzy for going home
for her kid's bath time.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.941
No, I did not. I passive-aggressively
shamed her in meetings

05:17.025 --> 05:19.736
until she elected to leave
of her own volition.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.362
Lauren's been nothing but professional.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.865
And I know I said
I could handle you hating her,

05:23.948 --> 05:26.284
but these daily diatribes
are getting kind of old.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.830
You know what's getting a little old
is Lauren.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.667
I just feel like
I'm always coming in second.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.880
Just because I couldn't go on one cruise,
which was my idea in the first place,

05:38.963 --> 05:40.298
does not mean you come second.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.552
And I must say, that's a rather
rich accusation coming from you.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.095
And why is that?

05:50.058 --> 05:54.145
Because he still thinks of Frankie
as his soul mate.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.940
Can you tell me more about that, Sol?

05:58.024 --> 06:01.360
I'm not sure I was being literal.
I was just musing.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.654
He "mused" it to her the other day.

06:05.281 --> 06:09.744
I have a complicated heart
with many compartments.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.954
It's a lot to manage.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.333
That must have triggered
some painful memories,

06:15.416 --> 06:17.627
especially considering what you shared

06:17.710 --> 06:20.963
about Sol's infidelity
before your wedding.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.718
I once again feel like I'm running a race
against someone I can never beat.

06:25.802 --> 06:30.139
The only thing going on between me
and Frankie is our new grandchild.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.725
If you don't count the all-night texting,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.978
and the all-day texting,
and her dropping by all the time.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.897
The texting bothers you because...

06:37.980 --> 06:41.609
It didn't bother me at all until
I found out how he still feels about her.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.195
I have barrels of feelings.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.073
Why are we cherry-picking this one?

06:47.156 --> 06:50.493
Because this is the one you kept from me.

06:52.495 --> 06:56.165
Robert, are you worried that there's
something inappropriate going on

06:56.249 --> 06:57.708
between Sol and Frankie?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.338
Well, I think when they're texting
at 2:00 a.m.,

07:02.421 --> 07:05.091
it's not only John Oliver
they're talking about.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.009
It's only about 40 percent.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.512
The rest is chitchat and patter.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.514
I can only imagine.

07:11.597 --> 07:15.435
Would it help if I let you read
our text messages?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.478
Because I have nothing to hide.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.522
Do you think that would help, Robert?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.275
Perhaps.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.903
Okay, then that's your homework.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.448
-Fine.
-Fine.

07:29.365 --> 07:33.244
Of course, Robert isn't fluent
in the language of emoji,

07:33.327 --> 07:35.705
so a lot will go over his head.

07:40.626 --> 07:45.256
Oh, fats! We should have brought
our camcorder to capture her reaction,

07:45.339 --> 07:47.884
like they do
with Publishers Clearing House.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.804
Well, you could use my phone, but
you've lost your "my phone" privileges.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.141
I have never felt more like Ed McMahon.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.810
And I have actually felt Ed McMahon.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.689
Hi! Is Harriet here?

08:01.772 --> 08:03.983
No, she's not. Who are you?

08:04.066 --> 08:06.277
Oh, I'm Grace Hanson
and this is Frankie Bergstein.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.156
-Have you heard of us?
-I can't say that I have.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.408
Oh, what an interesting shape.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.660
They're vaginas for Harriet.

08:14.744 --> 08:20.416
Well, I guess if anyone celebrated
their vagina, it was Harriet, poor thing.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.627
Why do you say "poor thing"?

08:23.211 --> 08:24.879
Harriet passed away last week.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.589
What?

08:26.672 --> 08:31.135
No, I'm just here
to feed Harriet's parrot, Parriet.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.470
I live next door.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.054
She's dead?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.225
But I came here to be cheered up!

08:37.308 --> 08:39.809
Oh, jeez. That's poor timing.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.354
Well, what happened?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.397
She had a heart attack.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.525
Oh, my God.

08:46.526 --> 08:51.781
The word on the street
is that she diddled herself to death.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.283
-Diddled?
-Yes.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.827
With this humongous vibrator

08:56.911 --> 09:01.499
that she bought
from some porno website for older ladies.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.126
-Oh, no.
-I thought she was getting them from us.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.837
She talked about it all the time.

09:06.921 --> 09:11.050
Now, I barely knew Harriet.
I'm really just friends with Parriet.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.511
I'm sure it wasn't her vibrator
that killed her.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.887
No, it was.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.890
Apparently, when they found her,
it was still buzzing.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.561
Oh, was that for Harriet?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.233
No, it's for us.

09:27.316 --> 09:30.194
-We won it at the Stop & Shop.
-The carnival.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.821
Stop & Shop Carnival.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.490
Behind the Stop & Shop store.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.327
She forgot her purse there,
so we better get going.

09:38.869 --> 09:39.704
Bye now.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.709
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.252
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.297
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Frankie!

09:49.380 --> 09:52.300
Look, this is tragic,
but it was not our fault.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.093
Kind of feels like our fault.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.596
Look, she died doing what she loved.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.932
There are worse ways to go.
Ask any of our friends who've died lately.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.601
I can't, they're so dead!

10:01.684 --> 10:03.269
When has that ever stopped you?

10:03.352 --> 10:07.982
I packed an instrument of death
into a box and sent a lady to her doom!

10:08.065 --> 10:10.651
In your defense, I don't think
that any of the boxes you packed

10:10.735 --> 10:12.028
made it to our customers.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.488
This was our biggest fan
and we whacked her!

10:14.572 --> 10:18.326
Okay, you have to stop talking like that
because we have a bigger problem here.

10:18.409 --> 10:22.788
That lady told two strangers
that Harriet died using our vibrator.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.458
-Who else is she gonna tell?
-The parrot?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.335
Oh, no. They repeat everything!

10:27.418 --> 10:29.545
I think we have to start thinking
about damage control.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.255
Damage control?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.382
We killed a woman who trusted us!

10:33.966 --> 10:36.385
Yeah. That's the damage
we have to control.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.765
Say Grace doesn't even surface
on social media anymore.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.310
Either they've forgotten about you or...

10:44.894 --> 10:46.729
they see you as old-fashioned.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.232
God, we're like a sad mall kiosk.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.694
We're like the Piercing Pagoda
that gave me that staph infection.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.404
Why is Barry here?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
Barry? What's going on?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.283
Lauren is coming! She's parking.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.661
-What? Why the fuck is Lauren here?
-No idea.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.246
-We were driving to lunch--
-You drive to lunch together?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.166
I don't have a car right now.
Can we talk about that later? I just...

11:07.249 --> 11:10.711
Lauren from Natural Feces
is parked in our handicap spot.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.797
-What does she want?
-Maybe trying to make things better?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.383
Make things better?
She is the queen of lies.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.719
She is the devil's concubine... Hi!

11:18.803 --> 11:20.805
-Hey!
-Surprise!

11:20.888 --> 11:21.889
I'll say!

11:22.723 --> 11:25.059
Wild honey from the bees in my hive.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.560
It's pure magic.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.021
Wow, you have a hive.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.565
And you're here. It's so much to process!

11:31.649 --> 11:34.235
Yeah, I know. Right? Ugh.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.529
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna believe this,

11:36.612 --> 11:39.532
but I have done something very similar
in my office.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.699
I do believe it.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.493
You know, actually,
it's my New York office,

11:42.576 --> 11:44.995
and it's in a brand-new building
with a ton of natural light,

11:45.079 --> 11:47.957
-so it's different from what you have.
-Pretty big window here.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.209
But, oh, wow! We always do this!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.419
You sure do!

11:51.502 --> 11:53.045
Stop copying me, you.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.381
-You stop copying me.
-No, you.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.968
-Call a tow truck.
-Mm-hmm.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.639
I was on the wrong private jet!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.391
Oh, no.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.559
Oh, my God.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.186
Such a relatable problem.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.771
Why are you here?

12:11.939 --> 12:13.065
I miss us.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.526
Well, I miss my belly button ring,

12:15.609 --> 12:19.029
but some things are best yanked out
and treated with antibiotics.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.616
See? I miss that. The banter.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.494
The way we used to push each other
and make each other better.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.623
If it weren't for the fierce competition
between us for all of those years,

12:29.707 --> 12:31.625
my company wouldn't be what it is today.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.088
But sadly, those days are passed.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.424
No, no, no, you used "sadly" wrong.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.677
Oh, honey, I know Say Grace is in trouble,

12:41.760 --> 12:43.429
but I can help.

12:43.929 --> 12:44.847
By buying you.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.599
-What?
-Oh, shit.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.100
Okay.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.352
Say Grace is not in trouble.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.439
Yeah, The Rock just tweeted about us,
so...

12:53.522 --> 12:54.940
And we're not for sale.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.442
Really? The Rock?

12:56.525 --> 12:59.820
Well, then I must have misunderstood
all of your employees

12:59.904 --> 13:01.989
flocking to me with resumes in hand.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.991
Can someone explain to me
what's going on?

13:04.074 --> 13:06.243
Uh, it's Erica. Okay, it has to be.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.497
She steals toner, her boobs are real
but terrible, now this.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.249
No, it's no one,
because no one is flocking to Lauren,

13:12.333 --> 13:16.712
because Lauren is making shit up,
which is what Lauren does.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.925
Listen, I know you have your pride,
and I respect that.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.719
All right, but you don't have
to pretend with me. I'm a friend.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.722
You know, I was saying to my husband,
Loren the other night...

13:26.805 --> 13:28.891
-Oh, God. Ew.
-...after we made love,

13:28.974 --> 13:32.478
"Loren, what should I do
with all the extra money I'm making?"

13:32.561 --> 13:36.315
And Loren said to me, "Lauren,
you need to help somebody in need.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.276
Like an Ethiopian child,
or your friend, Brianna."

13:39.360 --> 13:42.738
Yeah. You know, you should go home
tonight and say to Loren,

13:42.821 --> 13:47.493
"Loren, I got really confused
because Brianna and I are not friends."

13:47.576 --> 13:51.163
-Okay, but your company is in trouble.
-What is she talking about?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.791
Oh, Bar, did Brianna not...

13:54.375 --> 13:58.212
You know what? I just assumed you guys
share everything, like me and Loren.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.756
I forget not everybody has that.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.049
You should go now.

14:02.132 --> 14:06.178
Oh, the cute sister's right. All right.
You know what? I'll let you two catch up.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.932
Actually, you take the rest of the day
off, mister. All right?

14:10.015 --> 14:12.601
But I am gonna need you in
Saturday and Sunday.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.109
Hey, Rocco.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.821
It's Grace Hanson again. Remember me?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.906
You broke my antique chair.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.995
Anyway, my guest bath
is still raining into my kitchen.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.831
Can you get here
before I have an indoor pool?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.374
Thanks.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.465
What the hell are you doing?

14:45.301 --> 14:48.846
"This vibrator may cause severe death."
Are you insane?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.849
You have to scream "fire"
or people won't listen.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.851
Haven't you ever been to a movie theater?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.436
Uh.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.189
I needed to wax today, anyway.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.026
We are not using these labels.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.986
How are we supposed to stop
another customer

15:04.069 --> 15:06.238
from picking up a loaded Ménage

15:06.322 --> 15:09.325
and playing a losing round
of Rubbin' Roulette?

15:09.408 --> 15:10.576
You need to calm down.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.493
-Calm down?
-Yeah.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.872
I got dumped by my boyfriend
and I went on a killing spree!

15:14.955 --> 15:17.291
Look, this kind of crazy-eyed panic

15:17.374 --> 15:19.793
is exactly why
I'm gonna deal with this on my own.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.253
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.422
Remember our friend Marla from Flapper ?

15:24.256 --> 15:25.090
No.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.345
The lifestyle blogger.
Her article put us on the map.

15:31.055 --> 15:31.889
Nothing.

15:31.972 --> 15:35.142
Well, anyway, she's coming tomorrow
to interview me about Harriet.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.937
That way we can get ahead of the story
and warn everybody

15:38.020 --> 15:39.605
so this never happens again.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.358
So what about me?
I don't even get to talk to her?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.359
No.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.778
No.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.782
How come I can't remember Marla?

15:49.865 --> 15:51.367
Because you're old!

15:55.329 --> 15:59.458
And I knew that b-turd of a woman
was using you to humiliate me.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.794
Why didn't you tell me
the company was in trouble?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.712
Oh, because I didn't want you to know.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.756
Did you ever think I could've helped you?

16:06.548 --> 16:09.551
How? We're beyond fussing
with the budget, Barry.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.595
Can't fix this problem with your TI-84.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.098
-No, I just meant I could have--
-Could have what?

16:14.181 --> 16:15.724
Ridden in here on your white horse?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.851
Can't even ride in here
in your gray Subaru.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.312
Jesus Christ, Brianna.
I could have been there for you.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.398
I'm sorry,
but you have no idea what it's like

16:22.481 --> 16:24.608
to carry an entire company
on your shoulders.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.987
You know what? You're right. I don't.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.124
Well, what do you think?

16:40.207 --> 16:42.501
How many more haikus do I have to read?

16:42.584 --> 16:43.711
Seventeen.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.922
Are my eyes bleeding yet?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.554
-What was that?
-Nothing.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.516
-Then you won't mind if I read it.
-Not at all.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.856
Whose knees are these?

17:05.148 --> 17:07.443
They might not be knees at all.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.445
-It's "hot dogs or legs."
-What?

17:10.529 --> 17:13.198
It's a guessing game
that's captivated the Internet.

17:13.281 --> 17:17.118
Because, from a certain perspective,

17:17.202 --> 17:19.872
hot dogs look like legs.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.458
I think this one is hot dogs.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.461
Wait. No...

17:27.171 --> 17:28.130
Who's Roy?

17:30.716 --> 17:33.761
My "Both Tides Now" buddy.
I've mentioned him.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.512
Actually, you haven't.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.805
Sure, I did.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.641
The one from the Captain's Dinner.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.936
I remember hearing about the buffet
at the Captain's Dinner.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.104
That's where I met Roy.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.815
We were making fun
of the beef medallions.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.610
Is he gay?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.113
Not that it matters, but yes.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.281
Ha!

17:54.364 --> 17:56.158
No "ha." He's just a friend.

17:56.241 --> 18:00.746
How often would you say you text
with this Mr. Beef Medallion?

18:00.829 --> 18:04.708
-How about you stop interrogating me.
-How about you give me your phone back

18:04.792 --> 18:07.544
so I know exactly
what I'm interrogating you about.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.462
No!

18:09.755 --> 18:11.298
I thought you had nothing to hide.

18:11.715 --> 18:16.804
Fine, but I will not say another word
without my therapist present.

18:23.018 --> 18:27.022
Marla, I'm so grateful
that you agreed to do this. I thank you.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.358
Yeah. If it's okay,
I'd like to record it on the phone.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.026
Sure. Yeah.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.445
So what would you like to say
to Harriet's family?

18:33.529 --> 18:36.448
Well, our hearts ache for their loss.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.369
Yeah, Harriet was one of our best
customers and we loved her dearly.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.580
Are you concerned
that your vibrator is not safe?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.374
Oh, not at all.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.501
I mean, everyone should consult
their doctor

18:47.584 --> 18:51.755
before using something as effective
and exciting and affordable

18:51.839 --> 18:52.965
as our vibrator.

18:53.048 --> 18:58.345
And we can be found online
at www.ForeverVybrant.com.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.222
"Vybrant" is with a "Y."

19:01.390 --> 19:04.601
I guess my question is,
is your vibrator too dangerous

19:04.685 --> 19:06.353
-for your target demographic?
-Yes.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.273
Well, you know, Marla,
I have given that a lot of thought.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.568
You know, is Ménage à Moi too dangerous?

19:12.651 --> 19:17.406
Is our new travel size, Mini Ménage,
which is selling like hotcakes,

19:17.489 --> 19:20.200
is that too dangerous?
I think the answer is no.

19:20.284 --> 19:24.705
But I'm happy to continue the discussion
at our next pop-up this Saturday

19:24.788 --> 19:27.708
in Mission Valley, outside Nordstrom Rack.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.629
What is this, Hanson,
the Home Shopping Network?

19:32.713 --> 19:35.132
You're supposed to be warning people!

19:35.215 --> 19:37.634
Frankie, I was hoping
I could talk to you, too.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.429
Well, it's happening. We're murderers.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.181
No, that is off the record.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.933
It is so on the record.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.810
It's the hot hit single.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.312
A woman died here.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.189
Her name was Harriet, uh...

19:50.272 --> 19:51.732
I can't remember her last name.

19:51.815 --> 19:55.485
But whatever it was,
we can assume she wanted to live.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
And I will not stand by

19:57.321 --> 20:01.033
and watch another innocent woman die
because of our vibrator.

20:01.116 --> 20:04.161
Oh, for Heaven's sake, she didn't die
because of our vibrator.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.662
Yes, she did!

20:05.746 --> 20:08.749
And it could have been me
or you or Marla.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.876
Anybody could have been Harriet!

20:10.959 --> 20:13.295
And the public has a right to know.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.340
I'd especially like to warn
Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.260
RBG, if you've received my packages,
be careful.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.346
We need you now more than ever.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.181
Marla, how about you and I
go out for lunch.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.183
I know some places
where she's not allowed.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.935
Oh, you don't know all of them!

20:28.018 --> 20:31.855
No, it's okay. I'd actually like
to hear more from both of you.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.156
How did you find me?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.909
We live across the street.
I could see you from every window.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.827
-I'm not in the mood to talk.
-Really?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.497
Because I have given you
over 28 hours to brood.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.250
You know how many rats have been born
since we last spoke?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.794
-Is this what you want to talk about?
-No.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.257
I'm sorry for saying that horrible thing
and for not telling you.

20:59.841 --> 21:03.053
I just knew you would look at me like,
"Poor Brianna, I feel sorry for her."

21:03.136 --> 21:06.556
-And it's... it's humiliating.
-Okay, I'm your boyfriend.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.934
You don't have to put on
some strong front for me.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.727
-I do.
-You don't.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.230
I do!

21:14.439 --> 21:17.609
Because you fell for a badass CEO,
not a total fuck-up.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.986
You're not a total fuck-up.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.280
For the record,
I fell for "trash can Brianna."

21:21.363 --> 21:24.449
Okay, your cousins married each other,
if anyone's trash can--

21:24.533 --> 21:28.245
No. Do you remember how I used to be
terrified of you just like everybody else?

21:28.328 --> 21:29.246
Fondly.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.749
This one day I saw you strutting
all hot and cocky down the hallway

21:32.833 --> 21:34.668
until you walked right into a trash can.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.962
Doesn't sound like me at all,
but I'll entertain it.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.549
And you were clearly horrified and
relieved when you thought no one saw you.

21:40.632 --> 21:44.344
I mean, you were
such a colossal loser in that moment.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.681
And you're telling me now,
in this moment, because...

21:47.764 --> 21:49.266
Because it was adorable.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.311
It made me smile the whole day.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.480
And the next day, I asked you out.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.276
So in other words,
you decided that because I was a loser,

21:59.359 --> 22:01.778
-that you had a shot.
-Yes.

22:01.862 --> 22:06.825
But also, good things can happen
when you allow yourself to be human.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.704
Eh...

22:14.082 --> 22:17.836
So... you're still gonna love me
when Say Grace goes under

22:17.919 --> 22:19.421
and I'm super poor?

22:19.504 --> 22:22.299
Well, we'll be super poor together.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.385
I quit my job.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.806
-What?
-Yeah.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.267
I couldn't work for someone
who was that horrible to you.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.810
Although I did work for your mom.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.438
You always know how to make me smile.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.522
Come here.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.862
-I don't want to be poor.
-Yeah, poor sucks.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.033
"Vybrant Co-Founder Says
'We're Murderers'"?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.951
I'm not happy this happened, Grace.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.080
But I am glad that word is out
about our death sticks.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.915
What have you done, Frankie?

22:54.998 --> 22:56.458
This was our baby.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.585
This was our third act.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.588
This is what no one thought we could do

23:01.671 --> 23:04.049
and you probably ruined it for us.

23:04.132 --> 23:08.220
I did this in the name of my good friend,
Harriet No-Last-Name.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.474
Grace last-name-Hanson thinks you better
start looking for a new best friend.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.645
I like that you're finally admitting
we're best friends.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.985
And then Roy texted, and I quote,

23:24.069 --> 23:28.281
"You looked good in that Hawaiian shirt
at the Judy Collins Weep and Greet."

23:28.365 --> 23:29.199
Unquote.

23:29.282 --> 23:33.286
He was just trying to make me feel better
about my poor outfit choice!

23:34.037 --> 23:36.581
It was very windy on the lido deck.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.417
Roy will be in town next week.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.961
He's invited Sol out.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.754
He's coming here for work.

23:42.838 --> 23:47.425
He suggested a casual margarita.
I declined the suggestion.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.096
Do you see how Robert
could interpret this as flirting?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.181
I didn't mean to flirt.

23:54.015 --> 23:57.185
I didn't even intend
to stay in touch with Roy.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.187
Why do you think you did?

24:00.897 --> 24:05.443
I guess because I enjoy talking to him.

24:07.445 --> 24:11.074
I'm someone who needs people in his life.

24:19.624 --> 24:23.378
Sol does seem to be looking
for something with Roy,

24:23.461 --> 24:30.093
with Frankie, even with his activism
that he feels he is not getting at home.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.513
-Well, I can't be everything to him.
-And you shouldn't have to be.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.641
Have you two ever considered

24:36.725 --> 24:39.686
a less conventional approach
to your relationship?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.062
What do you mean?

24:41.396 --> 24:43.440
I've had patients, gay men in particular,

24:43.523 --> 24:49.321
who have had some success
venturing outside the social norms

24:49.988 --> 24:54.409
to find an arrangement
that works best for them.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.621
What kind of arrangement?

24:57.704 --> 25:01.416
Oh, something like
spending some time apart.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.295
What would that solve?

25:05.378 --> 25:08.256
Well, it might take the pressure
off of both of you,

25:08.340 --> 25:09.382
and your marriage.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.927
If a "Roy" pops up again,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.429
perhaps you could explore that
without any guilt.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.558
You mean...

25:19.392 --> 25:20.810
explore?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.940
But I'm Catholic, for Christ's sake!

25:25.023 --> 25:26.274
And we're married!

25:26.358 --> 25:27.400
And you're also men.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.819
You have complex biological impulses,

25:29.903 --> 25:34.074
and monogamy may run contrary
to those impulses.

25:35.116 --> 25:39.287
An open marriage is just one idea.
There are many others.

25:41.039 --> 25:45.502
All I'm saying is that
you may want to redefine intimacy

25:45.585 --> 25:49.422
to find what works for both of you
as a couple.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.966
But what does that mean?

25:51.049 --> 25:53.927
Well, it means that
in order to fix this relationship,

25:54.010 --> 25:57.305
you may need to... break it wide open.

26:07.857 --> 26:12.988
It's very uncomfortable eating dinner
with someone in complete silence.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.244
You have literally spoken
every 15 seconds.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.674
Are you Frankie Bergstein?

26:32.757 --> 26:35.260
I am thrilled to say I am not.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.721
Are you guys talking
Frankie Bergstein over here?

26:37.804 --> 26:38.638
Are you Frankie?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.807
-Yeah.
-My name is Sally Gaspar.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.809
I'm Harriet Frankel's cousin.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.936
Frankel! That's what it was.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.022
Oh, my God! Why are you here?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.524
Yeah, if you're here to kill her,
please come in.

26:51.443 --> 26:56.906
I'm sorry to barge in,
but a friend sent me your interview.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.868
I don't know if you believe
in these kinds of things, but...

26:59.951 --> 27:03.371
-if Harriet had a message from beyond...
-I believe in them!

27:03.455 --> 27:04.873
Harriet told me you would.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.585
And she'd tell you
that this was not your fault.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.046
No, you changed her life.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.547
-We did?
-Yeah.

27:12.630 --> 27:16.760
After her husband passed,
she stopped going to movies,

27:16.843 --> 27:18.762
she lost interest in temple.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.764
And then she found your product.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.432
And I know this sounds silly,

27:22.515 --> 27:25.935
but it brought back the cousin
that I once knew.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.856
She returned to temple
and started seeing movies?

27:29.939 --> 27:31.399
She even started rapping!

27:31.483 --> 27:33.151
Oh, tell me there's video.

27:33.234 --> 27:37.530
So... So you don't...
think that we killed her?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.157
No! Quite the opposite.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.118
Your vibrator gave her life.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.829
And then death, but first, life.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.915
See? Did you hear that?

27:47.248 --> 27:49.125
Yeah, I did.

27:49.209 --> 27:52.712
- You two have nothing to feel bad about.
- I'm so glad you feel that way.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.090
I don't know if the rest of the world
agrees with you--

27:55.173 --> 27:57.967
Are you kidding me?
Have you seen your Facebook page lately?

27:58.051 --> 28:02.138
I don't log on anymore because I end up
in a Jacob/Winnie rabbit hole.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.349
Yeah, and I'm too scared to look.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.476
Well, you should probably check it out.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.894
Oh, I almost forgot.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.731
I had these made for Harriet's friends.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.652
My grandson went to NYU
and now he's making T-shirts.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.989
I think we should all be
a little more like Harriet.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.368
Oh. Gosh!

28:26.454 --> 28:28.832
We have 4,000 new members!

28:28.915 --> 28:32.168
-Everybody is getting their Harriet on.
-Let's see.

28:32.252 --> 28:37.465
Terrie Sue Epperson from Yakima,
"I want what Harriet's having."

28:37.549 --> 28:42.637
Oh, Molly and Teresa of Colleyville, Texas
are hosting a Vybrant brunch!

28:42.971 --> 28:44.055
And... Oh, look at this.

28:44.139 --> 28:49.686
Katie from the Netherlands
is " bezeten " with Frankie Bergstein.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.313
Oh, God.
It's more than a vibrator now, isn't it?

28:52.397 --> 28:53.606
It's a movement.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.150
And we started it.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.151
Oh.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.820
Ah!

28:58.903 --> 29:00.572
What the hell?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.326
Oh, my G--

29:13.084 --> 29:14.252
