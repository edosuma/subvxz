RIB CARTILAGE YOU USED TO FIX

15:00.700 --> 15:02.019
HER NOSE.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.738

15:09.170 --> 15:11.309
PORTION OF THE SATURATED TISSUE.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.024
SHE'S BARELY HOLDING IT

16:09.030 --> 16:10.224
TOGETHER AS IT IS. SEEING YOU

16:10.230 --> 16:11.424
COULD SEND HER OVER THE EDGE.
