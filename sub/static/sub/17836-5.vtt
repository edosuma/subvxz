<i>Previously on</i> teen wolf...

00:02.069 --> 00:04.903
Find some way to remember me.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.240
A relic would be proof
that Stiles existed.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.608
<i>And maybe we can bring him back.</i>

00:09.610 --> 00:11.844
We take everyone into the argent bunker.
It's underground.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.145
Everyone would be safe.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.213
They're here.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.015
Where's Gwen?

00:16.017 --> 00:17.082
Come on!

01:17.077 --> 01:18.610
Excuse me.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.879
Sorry, where are we?

01:21.981 --> 01:23.916
We're at the train station.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.886
Right. Okay. Helpful.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.189
Which train station exactly?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.458
Train station number 137.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.901
Did you see me come in?

01:43.803 --> 01:44.903
No.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.973
How long have you been here?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.943
Maybe an hour?

01:50.945 --> 01:53.011
We got here at the same time.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.147
It's been at least six hours.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.415
Six hours?

01:58.051 --> 01:59.518
Where are you goin'?

02:07.026 --> 02:08.494
Uh, uh...

02:09.963 --> 02:12.631
I had a ticket with me
somewhere. Um...

02:13.800 --> 02:16.268
You always travel
in your work clothes?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.005
I must have been in a rush.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.161
Do you know
if anyone works here?

02:42.163 --> 02:45.464
<i>The
following stops have been canceled,</i>

02:45.466 --> 02:49.835
<i>Hollatine, Batten, Bay Burry,</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:52.437
<i>deer Ridge, red oak...</i>

02:52.439 --> 02:54.473
Excuse me, where are
those trains going?

02:54.475 --> 02:57.009
<i>Trenton, Anderson, King Springs.</i>

02:59.879 --> 03:01.780
Excuse me, do you know
what train this is?

03:06.653 --> 03:08.787
Does anyone know
where this train's going?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.722
Excuse me, do you know
what train this is?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.560
Do you know where
this train's going?

04:22.395 --> 04:24.162
It had to be you.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.522
Peter? Peter, what are you doing here?
How are you here?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.424
What do you mean how am I here?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.627
I'm here. You are here.
We are all here.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.863
Now, get the hell away
from me, Stiles.

05:40.573 --> 05:44.710
Hey, Peter. Peter. Peter!
What are you doing?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.345
I'm waiting for my train.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.246
Okay, did you not just see that?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.614
See what?

05:50.984 --> 05:56.088
The hogtied businessmen with the
magically dissolving ropes?

05:58.925 --> 06:01.660
I'm sorry,
did anyone just see that?

06:04.831 --> 06:07.933
Do you mind?
You're blocKing the board.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.001
I'd like a little warning
before my train arrives.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.006
Okay. So you're waiting
for a train.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.408
How did you get here?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.110
Pretty sure I took a cab.

06:18.112 --> 06:21.012
You were being locked away
in Eichen house.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.496
I was in Eichen.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.197
Thanks to you.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.134
Memory's good. Can you
remember how you, uh, got out?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.169
They discharge you?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.203
No, the power went out.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.438
And I ran like hell.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.973
That's it? You just ran?

06:48.608 --> 06:50.308
Yes, that's it.

06:50.310 --> 06:55.247
I literally just ran away from the insane
asylum that was holding me hostage!

08:22.970 --> 08:24.269
Hale!

08:24.271 --> 08:25.837
Get back in your cell!

08:26.939 --> 08:30.775
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.712
No. You're not.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.662
How long have I been here?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.363
The lockdown was
three months ago.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.769
I've been missing for three
months and no one came for me?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.971
That's what the ghost
riders do, they erase you.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.106
Ghost riders? Ghost
riders of the wild hunt?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.108
Yeah, you know
what I'm talKing about?

09:39.345 --> 09:42.414
Of course, I know
what you're talKing about.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.883
They ride the lightning.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.152
They are an unstoppable
force of nature.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.219
But, I promise you,

09:48.221 --> 09:50.989
they don't make pit-stops
in train stations.

09:56.128 --> 09:59.297
I've escaped one prison
only to land in another one.

09:59.299 --> 10:04.436
And this looks like the underground
lair of a depressed bureaucrat.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.871
Come on, there's gotta be a
way out of this place, right?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.073
Have you tried looKing around?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.175
Have you talked to anyone
who knows anything?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.745
If this is the wild hunt,
there is no escape.

10:13.747 --> 10:17.349
You and I are doomed
to ride the storm forever.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.516
Yeah, we're not in the storm,

10:18.518 --> 10:19.651
we're in a train station.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.086
But we can get out
of a train station.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.054
We can't get
out of here, Stiles.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.923
Because this place isn't real.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.992
What are you talKing about?

10:26.994 --> 10:30.929
Beacon hills
doesn't have a train station.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.437
What are you doing?

10:40.406 --> 10:41.806
Little help, please?

10:51.217 --> 10:52.384
Okay.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.959
What the hell?

11:17.777 --> 11:19.044
No, no, no, keep going.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.079
I don't see you
comin' up with anything.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.983
Stiles. Left
shoulder, against the pillar.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.218
Don't look.
I said don't look.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.286
Yeah.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.956
He's watching us.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.460
Yeah, so?

11:35.462 --> 11:39.030
Every person in this station is
either comatose or catatonic.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.566
He seems very interested
in keeping an eye on us.

11:50.676 --> 11:51.976
Hey!

11:55.347 --> 11:56.981
Oh, my god!

11:56.983 --> 11:58.416
Why are you watching us?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.555
You tried the doors.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.323
Nobody ever tries the doors.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.925
Sounds like you have.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.561
The ones that I could open.
I've tried everything else.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.863
Not everything.
You're still here.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.264
Yeah, it seems like you
got some kind of a plan.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.101
So why don't you
tell us about it?

12:16.103 --> 12:19.370
I can tell you. Doesn't
mean you can do it.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.844
Oh, we, we can do it.
He can, he can...

12:25.846 --> 12:27.912
Well, it's right
in front of your face.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.054
You didn't see it, did you?

12:36.856 --> 12:38.323
I saw it.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.025
Then why'd you waste so much
time running through the doors?

12:41.027 --> 12:42.660
I'll tell you why.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.496
Because it's all
part of the illusion.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.165
You're afraid.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.802
And they want you to be afraid.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.237
I'm not afraid.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.951
Can't do it, can you?
He can't do it.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.319
We really should kill him.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.556
Or you can just walk through it.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.560
Push me.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.263
What did you say?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.431
Push me.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.106
Now you're gettin' it.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.645
Stiles.
Stiles, let's go.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.520
The corpus callosum is not only

13:42.522 --> 13:44.622
the largest white matter
structure in the brain,

13:44.624 --> 13:48.526
but also the bridge connecting all
parts of the brain to each other.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.230
That ability for all parts
of the brain to communicate,

13:52.232 --> 13:56.367
and to work together, help us
make leaps in cognitive thinKing.

13:56.369 --> 14:00.839
Any questions, thoughts,
insight, Lydia?

14:03.143 --> 14:06.644
I completely agree.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.147
Is there something outside
that's more fascinating than

14:09.149 --> 14:10.815
the structure of the human mind?

14:10.817 --> 14:13.918
No. I don't think so.

14:15.622 --> 14:16.688
No.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.190
Okay. Good.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.794
Now, many people credit
the corpus callosum,

14:22.796 --> 14:25.129
uh, for giving us
a sense of intuition,

14:25.131 --> 14:28.066
gut instinct, even
we ourselves aren't aware...

14:28.068 --> 14:29.667
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.308
I'm just gonna check
if she's okay.

14:42.315 --> 14:46.084
You guys know that classes
aren't optional, right?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.722
Hey!

14:51.657 --> 14:54.325
Hey! You can't
tow this Jeep.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.595
Paperwork says I can.
It's reported as abandoned.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.199
And now it's not.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.834
Oh, this is your vehicle?

15:02.836 --> 15:04.102
Does it matter?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.437
Sounds like a no.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.574
It's mine. Uh, my Jeep.

15:09.576 --> 15:14.078
Thank you. I'll move it.
Once I get the keys.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.880
From my locker.
After you leave.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.949
I'm sorry,
once it's on the hook...

15:17.951 --> 15:19.817
Please don't say,
"you're on the hook."

15:19.819 --> 15:21.319
Well, I can't now.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.821
Oh, I, okay. Look, there's gotta
be something that we can do.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.089
Sign something?
Call someone?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.391
Pay someone?

15:29.028 --> 15:32.230
Drop fee's
a hundred and fifty. Cash.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.968
A hundred and fifty? This thing
isn't even worth that much.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.369
How much you got?

15:39.238 --> 15:41.239
Uh, how much have you got?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.274
Just give me your money.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.348
All I have is $50. And when I
say "all," I mean all. Uh...

15:56.822 --> 16:00.458
Hey. You know I don't actually have
the keys to this thing, right?

16:01.994 --> 16:04.662
But now we have a Jeep.

16:18.677 --> 16:22.880
Congratulations, you found another
part of the phantom train station.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.148
Is this the way out?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.718
If it was, we would be leaving.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.653
You might want
to stay off the tracks.

16:29.888 --> 16:33.091
'Cause that's
the way in and out.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.729
They're coming.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.798
That's the way out?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.034
How in the hell are
we supposed to do that?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.136
We jump.
Jump?

17:18.137 --> 17:19.936
On the back of the riders
as they go through.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.873
Is that all?
I've been timing it.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.308
Look, we can jump from here
just before they go out.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.377
I think you're confusing
your pronouns.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.413
We aren't going to do anything.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.082
But you should absolutely
give that a shot.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.316
Do you not wanna
get out of here?

17:32.318 --> 17:33.818
We want to get out alive, okay?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.853
How do you know this works? Seems
like a lot could go wrong.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.689
Look, I can't stay here. I'm
losing my mind in this place.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.225
I think you have an excellent
grasp of the situation.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.960
I say go for it.
Peter.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.962
Hey, they're coming back.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.107
No, we can't let him
do this, right?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.675
What if he's right?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.379
Hey, we'll figure
something else out.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.381
Hey, look, there's gotta be
another way out of this place.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.516
But there isn't. I've
been looKing for months.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.552
Are you comin' or not?
It's all you.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.722
Shit.
Let him try.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.630
Come on. Come on.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.748
Oof.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.685
Somehow I don't think that went
the way that he was hoping.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.494
Stiles, he's dead.

18:49.496 --> 18:53.131
You see his face?
Trust me, he's gone.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.165
You knew he'd die.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.969
I didn't know.
I mean, I assumed.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.770
Yeah, but you could
have warned him.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.039
He was gonna do it anyway.
Now, we know.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.174
Know what?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.809
That we're stuck.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.178
It's over.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.481
We are trapped because
that was our only way out.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.050
Or that's just what
they want us to believe.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.320
What? What is it
with you teenagers?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.356
You think that
you're so special?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.824
You think the rules
don't apply to you?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.459
Do you get it?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.361
We are dead and buried.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.571
Money? It's worthless.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.840
Driver's license?
Credit cards?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.109
Give me my damn wallet back.
It's all meaningless.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.479
Keys?
Give me my keys.

19:43.081 --> 19:45.850
What, did you think you were
gonna drive us out of here?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.451
Is that what you thought?

19:47.453 --> 19:50.488
Do you get it?
We don't exist.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.757
And we are already forgotten.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.994
Somebody's gonna remember me.

19:58.096 --> 20:01.365
Either Lydia, or Scott,
Malia, someone.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.968
They're gonna find me,
all right?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.670
They'll come for me.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.740
Who would ever come for you?

20:13.579 --> 20:16.147
You give me a call when your
high school sweethearts

20:16.149 --> 20:18.382
conjure up a plan
to get out of here.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.674
I'm waiting for a train.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.445
Yeah, it's probably
runnin' late.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.381
I'm going to see
my grandchildren.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.484
Who are you going to see?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.520
Uh, no one.

20:56.522 --> 21:01.292
<i>The
following stops have been canceled,</i>

21:01.294 --> 21:05.296
<i>Hollatine, Batten, Bay Burry,</i>

21:05.298 --> 21:07.898
<i>deer Ridge, red oak,</i>

21:07.900 --> 21:12.837
<i>Trenton, Anderson, King Springs.</i>

21:31.923 --> 21:33.190
Intercom.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.462
Maybe a radio?

21:45.671 --> 21:50.007
Your theory is ridiculous.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.543
Magnetic disturbances and a few
pixelated photos doesn't mean

21:52.545 --> 21:57.481
that you can use a ham radio to communicate
across a supernatural barrier.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.117
Ghost riders can't be seen,
heard, or remembered.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.219
You really think they're gonna
leave a gadget around that

22:02.221 --> 22:03.921
you can use to
call your friends?

22:12.230 --> 22:14.031
There you are.
You heard it too?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.966
Where's it coming from?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.168
This way.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.190
It's coming from inside.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.836
Did somebody just
lock the keys inside?

22:51.838 --> 22:53.838
Break it.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.826
Take your time. No rush.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.763
Only thing at stake is any
evidence of our existence.

23:18.765 --> 23:22.199
Soon to be lost.
Forever.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.868
Okay, not helping.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.144
In case you're keeping count,

24:07.146 --> 24:09.313
that's twice
I've saved your life today.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.433
Why'd it stop?

24:29.435 --> 24:30.935
It doesn't matter.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.505
There has to be a reason.

24:37.843 --> 24:38.909
What?

24:40.378 --> 24:41.579
You caught a scent?

24:41.581 --> 24:47.785
Yeah. Uh, ours. Mine,
yours, all three of us.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.621
Mine? I've never been
in this Jeep before.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.457
Neither have I.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.894
Yes, we have.
We just don't remember it.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.996
I thought we were done
with that.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.798
Uh, yeah, Lydia, Parrish
checked the Vin number.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.066
There's no record of owner.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.235
The Jeep didn't just
drive itself here.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.305
Whose side are you on?

25:11.776 --> 25:13.344
I'm on everyone's side.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.981
He's not real.
Trust me.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.951
I've lost a lot of
people in my life.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.187
It's a long list and I don't
feel like adding to it.

25:26.258 --> 25:30.961
You might not have to.
Not if we get him back.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.671
This is from '96.
And there's no name.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.439
But there's an address.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.008
129 woodbine Lane.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.076
I know that address.

25:49.014 --> 25:50.915
I don't know what to tell you.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.017
I haven't seen that Jeep in...

25:53.618 --> 25:55.786
Almost 18 years.

25:57.255 --> 25:58.489
It's in your name.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.724
But it was stolen.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.726
Then how did it end up
at the high school?

26:04.863 --> 26:06.130
Beats the hell out of me.

26:06.132 --> 26:09.733
I mean, that thing was a
junker back in the day.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.002
God only knows
who'd want it now.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.638
Maybe somebody dumped it there?

26:14.640 --> 26:17.875
Is there any way to trace the history
of the Jeep after it was stolen?

26:18.376 --> 26:20.110
No.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.879
Maybe there's
fingerprints in it.

26:22.547 --> 26:26.083
Lydia, is this about Stiles?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.853
Honey, don't you think
you've taken this far enough?

26:32.524 --> 26:35.392
I don't really know
what's going on with you lately,

26:35.394 --> 26:39.096
but maybe it's a good
time to talk to your mom.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.403
I'm sorry. You're right.

26:48.740 --> 26:51.342
Hey, you okay?

26:53.011 --> 26:57.881
No, yeah. I'm sorry, can you just...
Uh, do you mind...

26:57.883 --> 27:00.951
Of course.
Take your time.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.555
We already paid you. I gave you all
of my money for that drop fee.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.123
Yeah, and I dropped it,
all right?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.059
Now I'm picKing it up again.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.794
How much?
I'll write you a check.

28:16.796 --> 28:20.264
It's not about how much. They want it
out of here, okay? It's not up to me.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.968
Don't make me
move you, kid, okay?

28:24.970 --> 28:27.871
I'm hookin' this thing up
and I am towing it away.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.115
Your truck's broke.

29:07.212 --> 29:09.947
This place is really
startin' to fill up.

29:12.550 --> 29:15.886
Gwen? Gwen! Phoebe? Oh,
my god, you're here!

29:21.493 --> 29:23.727
Wait a second.
That girl, I know that girl.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.596
Her name is Gwen.
She plays lacrosse.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.273
How long has this been going on?

29:42.647 --> 29:46.416
This isn't a train station,
this is a way station.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.919
It's not gonna stop.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.960
What is it?

29:56.962 --> 30:01.498
What are those places? Bannack? Canaan?
I know you know something.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.935
We gotta get out of here.
Nobody is safe.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.303
Yeah, in here?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.238
In Beacon Hills. Your friends,
your family, everyone.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.107
You've gotta go.
They're gonna be taken.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.143
Where are you going?

30:25.623 --> 30:26.957
What did you see up there?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.859
The towns. What did it mean?
I just told you.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.295
They're never gonna stop.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.863
Okay, so what's the plan then?

30:32.865 --> 30:34.598
I'm goin' through the portal.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.234
Wait, wait, wait. No one gets through
the portal, you said that yourself.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.237
No human can. But I'm better
than human, remember?

30:40.239 --> 30:41.471
I'll heal.

30:43.875 --> 30:48.178
Stiles, let's not have a moment.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.814
If you survive, you have to
find my friends for me, okay?

30:50.816 --> 30:52.082
You have to tell them about me.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.483
'Cause they're not gonna
remember me,

30:53.485 --> 30:56.453
so you have to tell them that I'm here.
When I survive,

30:56.455 --> 31:00.624
I'm going to get as far away from
Beacon Hills as I possibly can.

31:00.626 --> 31:04.061
And if I happen along one of
your below average friends

31:04.063 --> 31:06.163
and it doesn't inconvenience me,

31:06.165 --> 31:09.299
I might mention your name.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.137
Yeah, what about Malia?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.817
<i>All
additional units to the lower level.</i>

31:26.819 --> 31:30.387
<i>We need full force containment
on the lower level.</i>

31:37.495 --> 31:38.662
Lockdown.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.452
I know you're doing
this for her.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.955
You're risKing being
incinerated for her.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.623
And I'm okay with that.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.793
Stiles.

32:15.066 --> 32:16.566
Stall them.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.435
What? How?

32:18.437 --> 32:19.770
Use your head.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.525
What're you doing?

34:27.533 --> 34:28.931
What the hell?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.438
Did you hear that?

34:34.440 --> 34:36.572
I think all of
Beacon Hills heard that.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.275
Who is it?

34:38.277 --> 34:41.511
I'm not sure, but I
think I recognized it.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.045
Go!

34:52.456 --> 34:54.791
Hey.
Any luck?

34:54.793 --> 34:59.396
No. He hasn't roared again.
I've got a scent but...

34:59.398 --> 35:01.398
There's something wrong with it.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.501
It smells like whoever
it is, is burning.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.320
- I hear a heartbeat.
- Who is that?

35:23.322 --> 35:26.923
I don't know,
but I know the scent.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.625
Even through the barbecue.

35:32.396 --> 35:33.864
How do you think he got here?

35:33.866 --> 35:35.665
There's no tracks.
No fire.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.307
Oh, my god.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.446
Peter?

35:53.851 --> 35:55.051
Who's Peter?

35:56.687 --> 35:57.888
Peter hale.

35:59.524 --> 36:00.590
My dad.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.864
<i>You were my beta first...</i>

36:19.278 --> 36:21.545
Peter.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.682
He bit me.
How could I forget him?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.385
How did I forget him?

36:30.221 --> 36:33.490
He has something.

37:05.690 --> 37:06.756
What is it?

37:22.374 --> 37:28.144
Pripyat, Bannack, Canaan,
Beacon Hills.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.555
Canaan.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.458
Don't flood it.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.960
Do you even know
what that means?

38:18.696 --> 38:19.896
Not really.

39:08.546 --> 39:09.646
<i>Hello?</i>

39:09.648 --> 39:12.048
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.351
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

39:14.353 --> 39:16.052
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

39:21.325 --> 39:22.692
Stiles?

39:24.362 --> 39:27.597
Stiles, are you there?

39:27.599 --> 39:30.200
<i>Scott? Lydia?
Is that you?</i>

39:30.202 --> 39:32.035
Okay.
Oh, my god, Stiles.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.504
We can hear you.

39:34.506 --> 39:37.507
<i>Oh, my god, you know me?
You remember me?</i>

39:37.509 --> 39:39.476
Stiles, is thi...

39:39.478 --> 39:42.112
Is this you?
Is this actually you?

39:42.948 --> 39:45.949
<i>Do you remember
the last thing I said to you?</i>

39:48.419 --> 39:49.919
You said...

39:53.457 --> 39:55.625
You said,
"remember I love you."

40:03.000 --> 40:04.768
<i>Are you okay?</i>

40:04.770 --> 40:06.836
Where are you?
We're comin' to get you.

40:06.838 --> 40:09.606
<i>No, no, no. You can't.
You won't be able to find me.</i>

40:09.608 --> 40:12.842
Stiles, what...

40:12.844 --> 40:14.244
What are you talKing about?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.045
Just tell us where you are,
and we'll, we'll come and...

40:16.047 --> 40:18.114
<i>Right, just remember this.
Canaan, okay?</i>

40:18.116 --> 40:21.151
<i>You have to find Canaan.
Just find Canaan.</i>

40:38.269 --> 40:39.869
Stiles!
