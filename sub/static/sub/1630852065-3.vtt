11:23.423 --> 11:25.881
There you go. All done.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.340
[grunts] Thanks.

11:28.131 --> 11:29.131
But...

11:30.798 --> 11:31.840
while you're here,

11:31.923 --> 11:34.298
I wouldn't mind running a few tests
on your genetic makeup.

11:34.381 --> 11:36.465
What's wrong with my genetic makeup?

11:36.548 --> 11:39.340
Humans greatly improved
the genetic enhancement tech

11:39.423 --> 11:41.256
since you were sent into space.

11:41.340 --> 11:43.090
We use it to get dogs
back to normal when...

[alarm dings]

11:46.465 --> 11:47.465

11:47.548 --> 11:49.590
Things like that happen.

-[pod doors whoosh open]
-[grunts]

11:56.673 --> 12:00.673
It looks like he's more
of a ten-tactical officer. [chuckles]

12:01.256 --> 12:04.506
-I am in a huge amount of pain.

12:09.256 --> 12:10.673
If you go in after him, Kira,

12:10.756 --> 12:13.715
we can get you up to speed
with all the other dogs on the ship.

12:14.465 --> 12:18.256
Oh, so I can only fit in here
if I change my DNA? Is that it?

12:18.340 --> 12:21.298
What? No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

12:21.381 --> 12:25.631
It's just that we can upgrade
your enhancement to be more like us?

12:25.715 --> 12:28.381
How much of my dog self
do I have to give up

12:28.465 --> 12:30.965
-before I'm enough for all of you?
-[smash]

12:31.048 --> 12:33.673

Hey, Chonies, do you have some sort of
collar remover in here or--

13:11.381 --> 13:12.798
[roars]

13:12.881 --> 13:15.006
Is that Luke?

-[Penelope] Focus!

13:29.173 --> 13:31.715
Hey, do you think we can talk this over?

13:31.798 --> 13:33.131
[grunts]

13:35.340 --> 13:37.673
-Captain!
-[grunts] Chonies!

13:38.465 --> 13:40.340
[grunts] Any tech we can use?

13:42.965 --> 13:44.381
Here, Captain! Catch!

Argh! Come on, Kira!
Let's take this mutant down!

13:57.798 --> 13:59.090
I can't help you.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.798
What do you mean?

14:00.881 --> 14:03.298
Everything I've done on this ship,
I've screwed up.

14:03.881 --> 14:05.715
I don't want to make things worse.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.256
[Penelope] Insight!

14:07.340 --> 14:11.631
Kira! I know the M-Bark must be
super weird after all the time alone!

14:11.715 --> 14:14.965
But taking down weird monsters?
That's your thing!

14:15.465 --> 14:19.631
You literally eat guys like him
for breakfast!

14:20.590 --> 14:22.590
-Help!

[Penelope] Strategy!

14:43.923 --> 14:46.506
We need to get him back into the machine.
I'll distract him!

15:29.965 --> 15:33.548
Well, that was traumatic. [grunts]

15:35.340 --> 15:37.715
Told you. You got skills.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.881
So Chonies, about that collar remover--

15:39.965 --> 15:41.298
-Garbage!
-[gasps]

15:41.381 --> 15:42.965
Have you been in there
watching the whole time?

15:43.048 --> 15:45.131
What did you see? I can explain!

15:45.215 --> 15:47.631
I was! From the safety of my desk.

15:48.090 --> 15:52.506
And I saw you demonstrate the qualities
of a good Captain.

15:52.590 --> 15:53.715
So,

15:53.798 --> 15:55.256
ta-da!

15:55.340 --> 15:57.340
-[electronic chirps]
-[clunk]

15:57.423 --> 16:01.006
You and Kira clearly bring out
the best in each other.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.381
I'm impressed.

16:02.465 --> 16:05.381
You may resume command of the Pluto.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.631
Yes!

16:07.340 --> 16:11.215
And I'm recommending to the Council
that Kira joins your crew.

16:11.923 --> 16:15.715
I'm still not sure the M-Bark
is right for me, Garbage.

16:17.173 --> 16:18.256
I'm sorry.

16:19.173 --> 16:22.215
Kira said she's only staying
until her arm is healed.

16:22.298 --> 16:25.798
I don't think she's ready
to call the M-Bark home.

16:25.881 --> 16:26.881
Wait, that's it!

16:27.465 --> 16:29.715
[Nomi] We've got one last thing
we want to show you.

16:31.215 --> 16:34.173
It's the best place on the whole M-Bark!

16:34.256 --> 16:37.048
Nomi, I'm not really
in the mood for karaoke.

16:37.923 --> 16:39.090
[singsong] Ta-da!

16:42.465 --> 16:43.465
[gasps]

16:48.965 --> 16:50.965
It's my home.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.465
Yeah, we figured you needed somewhere
that was a bit more you.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.548
I love it!

16:58.131 --> 17:00.131
Do you love it enough to stay?

17:02.798 --> 17:04.090
Yeah.

17:04.715 --> 17:05.965
At least for now.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.423
Woo-hoo! Bring it in, everyone!

17:13.131 --> 17:15.256
Uh, I gotta go. Maybe next time.

17:18.423 --> 17:20.256
She'll come around.
