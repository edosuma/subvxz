WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:02.741
[Jefferson] Last season
onBlack Lightning...

00:02.785 --> 00:04.656
Now, the purpose
of Black Lightning

00:04.700 --> 00:07.268
was to kill Tobias,
who killed my father.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.312
[groans]

00:09.226 --> 00:10.053
I got that Green Light.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.621
Oh, I got your Green Light.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.536
[Gambi] Thirty years ago,
I came to Freeland

00:14.579 --> 00:17.060
as an agent for
a government organization
called the ASA.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.931
They were conducting
an experiment in Freeland.

00:18.975 --> 00:22.065
Their vaccine inadvertently
created metahumans.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.806
People with special powers.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.851
Yeah, I don't
wanna have powers.
I don't wanna save the world.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.679
[Lynn] I've been
doing some analysis.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.030
It turns out
that the vaccine's
related to Green Light.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.031
[Thunder] Dad.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.252
I need you to find
Black Lightning.

00:35.296 --> 00:39.126
I finished the project
you were working on
before you got hurt.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.954
[Tobias] Painkiller.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.262
[groans]

00:45.306 --> 00:47.134
[grunting]

00:47.177 --> 00:48.222
You're a monster.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.962
That's funny coming from you.

00:50.006 --> 00:52.139
You're right.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.097
[Thunder] Okay, how do we
get them out the pods?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.446
I... I need the briefcase.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.187
[Syonide] From our man
in the coroner's office...

00:57.231 --> 00:58.406
Proctor's thumbs.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.669
Mmm.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.063
You're looking at
the king of Freeland.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.238
Long live the king.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.991
-[officer 1] Stop resisting!
-[woman] Stop it!

01:19.035 --> 01:21.124
-You're hurting him!
-[officer 2] Get down
on the ground!

01:21.168 --> 01:23.126
Do it now!

01:23.170 --> 01:26.216
-[man] Stop it, man!
-[officers shout indistinctly]

01:26.260 --> 01:27.826
[woman] You're hurting him!

01:29.959 --> 01:31.352
Stop it! Stop it!

01:31.395 --> 01:33.136
[siren wailing in distance]

01:33.180 --> 01:36.096
[crying] Stop... Stop it.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.489
That is a child!

01:38.533 --> 01:41.013
You don't have
to do that to him!

01:42.189 --> 01:43.842
That is a child!

01:43.886 --> 01:45.409
-[Reverend Holt]
Lord have mercy!
-[congregation cheering]

01:45.453 --> 01:48.151
Come on, somebody!

01:48.195 --> 01:49.152
Come on, somebody!

01:53.287 --> 01:54.592
[man 1] Amen!

01:54.636 --> 01:56.638
[woman 1] It's okay.
It's all right. It's okay.

01:56.681 --> 01:59.249
-[woman 2] Take your time now.
-[woman 3] Take your time.

01:59.293 --> 02:05.864
The killing of Issa Williams
is proof that this drug,
Green Light...

02:05.908 --> 02:07.997
[woman 4]
Lord knows! Lord knows!

02:08.040 --> 02:11.305
...has left our community
in grave danger.

02:11.348 --> 02:17.224
There are people infected
with this drug who are running
around with dormant powers.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.703
-[woman 5] Yes.
-[man 2] That's right.

02:18.747 --> 02:22.054
And the police are
using that as an excuse

02:22.098 --> 02:26.233
to continue to hunt down
young black men
and young black women

02:26.276 --> 02:30.367
with a "shoot first,
ask questions later"
mentality!

02:30.411 --> 02:32.239
[cheering and applause]

02:33.588 --> 02:35.067
But I'm here to tell you...

02:35.111 --> 02:37.200
-[woman 6] That's right.
-[woman 7] All right.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.203
The police have been
killing and shooting

02:40.247 --> 02:42.814
-and brutalizing
and terrorizing...
-[woman] Yeah! Yes, Reverend!

02:42.858 --> 02:48.342
...black people long before
the drug Green Light
hit the streets of Freeland!

02:48.385 --> 02:50.039
-[all cheering]
-Yes!

02:52.041 --> 02:54.435
[Rose] Three months ago,
the One Hundred
invaded Garfield,

02:54.478 --> 02:58.090
resulting in a faculty member
and a student being kidnapped,

02:58.134 --> 02:59.396
your daughters.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.442
A week ago, three suspects
invaded the school,

03:01.485 --> 03:04.053
one who shot students
with poisoned darts,

03:04.096 --> 03:07.274
another holding kids hostage
in a classroom with a gun.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.101
I'm aware of
what happened at the school.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.843
Of course you are.
But after the fact,
Principal Pierce,

03:11.887 --> 03:13.541
because you were
not on campus.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.413
Again, I was
on a mini vacation
with my family--

03:16.457 --> 03:19.329
In a remote area
where there was very limited
means of communication.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.940
Yeah, we get it.
But even days
after the attack,

03:21.984 --> 03:23.551
you chose not
to show up to work.

03:23.594 --> 03:27.468
This was just a matter of...
Unfortunate timing.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.383
Very unfortunate,
Principal Pierce.

03:29.426 --> 03:32.212
I'm sure you understand
that something must be done.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.431
-The school
will remain closed.
-Excuse me, the school--

03:34.475 --> 03:39.784
Will remain closed
until we find psychological
responders for the students,

03:39.828 --> 03:42.700
the school is repaired
and the board is
finished deliberating

03:42.744 --> 03:47.270
and has come to a conclusion
concerning disciplinary action
with regard to you.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.797
[Agent Odell sighs]

03:52.841 --> 03:54.146
[Agent Odell] Honestly, lady,
that dog don't hunt,

03:54.190 --> 03:56.061
so I'm gonna
ask you to try again.

03:56.105 --> 04:00.327
How did you, of all people,
get access to these pods?

04:00.370 --> 04:02.807
I already told you,
I don't know who it was.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.418
It was
an anonymous phone call.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.812
So out of the blue,
someone called you

04:07.856 --> 04:12.730
and asked you to come on down
and claim the pod people?

04:12.774 --> 04:16.299
I've been studying Green Light
for some time and...

04:16.343 --> 04:19.694
I'm not really interested
in what you've been
studying now.

04:19.737 --> 04:23.872
I prefer
you answer my question.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.440
Excuse me, I would
like to finish my answer.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.923
I've been studying Green Light
for some time now.

04:31.967 --> 04:35.100
And I understand
its components
and neurological effects

04:35.144 --> 04:36.928
better than anyone.

04:36.972 --> 04:40.062
What happened
to the other scientist
that was managing the pods?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
When we arrived,
no one was there.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.763
Just the children
in those pods.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.504
So, I guess he went
to the same place

04:47.548 --> 04:51.813
as, um,
the surveillance footage
and Agent Proctor.

04:57.601 --> 04:58.515
[sighs]

04:58.559 --> 05:01.736
This is useless.
I'm done here.

05:01.779 --> 05:07.481
You are not allowed
to leave town or talk
to anybody about this

05:07.524 --> 05:08.873
until the investigation
is over.

05:08.917 --> 05:12.747
And your access
to the pods is finished.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.489
What? Did you
not hear what I said?

05:15.532 --> 05:19.101
I understand Green Light
and these children
better than anyone.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.368
You're a liar.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.805
You've been sitting here
lying to me for about
an hour and a half.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.590
You know you're lying.
You're not going to admit it.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.374
And I don't like liars.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.377
Not because they lie,
because we all lie,

05:34.421 --> 05:37.424
but because
they make my job harder,

05:37.467 --> 05:41.036
and I have enough
cow manure to deal with

05:41.079 --> 05:45.519
than to have you
make my life more difficult.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.913
Thank you
for your cooperation...

06:30.694 --> 06:32.392
So, now I'm floating?

06:33.871 --> 06:35.220
Anissa, please
don't tell Mom and Dad

06:35.264 --> 06:36.657
or I'll never
leave the house again.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.833

Jefferson, this is clearly
not about training her.

This is about

her mental health.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.269

You're the only person
I can go to.

12:19.216 --> 12:23.003
-And why would I help you?
-I know who has the briefcase.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.832
I'll get it.
When I do, it's yours.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.923
But I need out of the ASA
and safe passage
out of the life.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.449
What's in the briefcase
that makes it so valuable?

12:36.886 --> 12:37.974
[scoffs]

12:42.718 --> 12:44.676
I didn't know
it was a rogue operation.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.550
Does it really matter?
Now, what's in the briefcase?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.119
Hell.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.732
[Napier] I'm gonna be honest.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.908
I don't think you're taking
this situation seriously.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.518
Oh, I'm taking it
very seriously.

13:00.562 --> 13:04.609
Then act like it. Stop being
so damn stubborn and arrogant.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.916
-Oh, so I'm arrogant now?
-Negro, please.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.918
Is that really up for debate?

13:08.962 --> 13:12.835
The board has always
thought that your inability
to listen to anything

13:12.879 --> 13:14.619
about enhancing
the school's security,

13:14.663 --> 13:17.013
especially after your girls
were snatched out of it,

13:17.057 --> 13:21.626
was the height
of "I'm the HNIC" mentality.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.804
A mentality that left
the school vulnerable
to exactly what happened.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.109
Oh, really?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.720
-Do you feel that way?
-Yes.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.506
Jefferson, we have been
friends since the Olympics,

13:31.549 --> 13:33.943
but on this thing, you're
putting me in a position

13:33.987 --> 13:38.121
to have to explain
to these white folks
all things African-American,

13:38.165 --> 13:41.211
-including your black ass.
-Oh.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.084
So you're their, uh...
Their blackspert now?

13:44.127 --> 13:46.869
Watch yourself, brother.
I don't like the way
you said that.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.002
Too damn close
to calling me a house nigger.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.309
Come on, Napier,
you were born in Freeland.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.181
We come from the same place.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.879
And you know
that the board has been
trying to take over Garfield

13:56.923 --> 14:00.013
simply because
I will not treat
these kids like criminals.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.405
Oh, they have money, right?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.930
They have money
for metal detectors.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.541
They have money for...
for guards with guns,

14:06.584 --> 14:09.109
but they never seem to have
money for books, though.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.720
Teachers' raises
or core computers.

14:11.763 --> 14:15.898
When I'm sitting
on that board, my only
concern is the students,

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
not you, Jefferson.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.120
But we're blessed.

14:20.163 --> 14:23.253
Who knows how much worse
the situation would have been

14:23.297 --> 14:26.430
if Black Lightning and Thunder
hadn't shown up.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.042
Like them, I'm trying
to save the school...

14:30.086 --> 14:31.348
Not your job.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.441
[sighs]

14:37.485 --> 14:40.009
We've taken a look
at the government's response

14:40.053 --> 14:45.449
to our request
that they release or allow you
to see your loved ones.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.365
Their position is that
this is a public health issue,

14:48.409 --> 14:53.457
and in the interest
of public safety and
the safety of your loved ones,

14:53.501 --> 14:58.941
there will be no access
granted to your family members
who are still in the pods,

14:58.985 --> 15:00.508
until further notice.

15:00.551 --> 15:04.033
Basically, their position is
they own your family members.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.557
-What the hell
you mean, "own"?
-[woman] Really?

15:06.601 --> 15:09.169
So we're going to have
to sue the government

15:09.212 --> 15:11.040
for the return
of your loved ones.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.826
And I'll be honest with you,
it's gonna be
a costly legal battle,

15:14.870 --> 15:17.133
but we have to be
willing to sacrifice

15:17.177 --> 15:19.092
-for our children.
-Yes.

15:19.135 --> 15:23.574
Reverend Holt,
as Dr. King said,
"We all have a role to play

15:23.618 --> 15:25.968
in the struggle for
the liberation of our people.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.927
-Each and every one of us."
-[man] That's right.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.363
[applauding]

15:31.060 --> 15:32.888
God bless you, brother.

15:35.064 --> 15:38.198
And I would personally
like to thank Benjamin Crump

15:38.241 --> 15:41.810
for his service
to our community.

15:41.853 --> 15:49.296
Well, uh... We are
doing everything we can
here at this church to

15:49.339 --> 15:52.995
put together a plan to try
to give financial assistance

15:53.039 --> 15:55.998
to anyone or everyone
who needs it.

15:56.042 --> 15:59.784
-Well, how much money
do we need to raise?
-Right.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.483
Considering we have
a lot of families to help,

16:03.875 --> 16:07.270
we need to raise
well over $500,000.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.012
-Wow.
-[all gasp and murmur]

16:10.056 --> 16:12.406
Like I said,
we're doing everything we can.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.497
[Anissa] The government
owns them? That's crazy!

16:16.540 --> 16:19.152
-We have to help those people.
-We already have.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.371
We exposed
the Green Light experiments,

16:21.415 --> 16:23.025
got the pods into
the hands of the authorities.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.550
Now it's time
to let the justice system
run its course.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.031
Oh, Dad, come on, now.
The system?

16:29.075 --> 16:32.034
The system is rigged.
You know that better
than anyone.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.777
Okay, look.
Black Lightning and Thunder
will always fight for justice,

16:35.820 --> 16:37.605
but as unfair
as the system is,

16:37.648 --> 16:40.042
some issues need to be
resolved within the system

16:40.086 --> 16:41.652
to bring about
permanent change.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.045
Okay, so if Jennifer and I
were in those pods,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.655
-would you be saying that?
-[sighs]

16:44.699 --> 16:46.266
Those people are never
gonna have enough money

16:46.309 --> 16:47.571
to sue the government
for custody.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.051
Okay. Anissa, listen to me.

16:49.095 --> 16:52.185
I despise the fact that
those kids are in those pods.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.838
I could easily be in one.

16:53.882 --> 16:58.060
But Tobias, Khalil, Syonide
are still out there.

16:58.104 --> 17:02.456
The attack on Garfield
was just a trap
meant for me, for us.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.763
They're gonna keep coming
again and again and again.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.070
They will not stop
until they get what they want.

17:08.114 --> 17:12.770
So we need to be focused
on finding them or being ready
for when they find us.

17:12.814 --> 17:18.254
Anissa, look.
We have done all that we can
for those children,

17:18.298 --> 17:25.131
but our job right now
is to facilitate the demise
of Tobias Whale.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.872
It's time to walk away. Okay?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.614
I'll see you at the house.

17:34.183 --> 17:39.145
Jen, you can't ignore this
in the hope that
it's gonna go away.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.494
-[remote clicks]
-[Jennifer clears throat]

17:41.582 --> 17:44.324
-Give me that.
-[remote clicks]

17:44.367 --> 17:46.891
Look. I know
this has been a lot,

17:46.935 --> 17:48.763
finding out about
your dad and Anissa.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.591
And discovering
you have powers

17:50.634 --> 17:52.941
must be mind-blowing
on so many levels.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.422
But you can't isolate yourself
and not talk about--

17:55.465 --> 17:57.206
What do you want me to say?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.600
That you're gonna
commit to finding a way
of dealing with this.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.516
Dealing with what?
The fact that I float
in my sleep?

18:02.559 --> 18:05.127
Or that Dad died... Twice?

18:05.171 --> 18:08.217
Are you dealing
with the fact that you shot
someone with a shotgun,

18:08.261 --> 18:09.871
or that Gambi killed a man,

18:09.914 --> 18:11.481
or that I electrocuted
somebody who might
be dead now?

18:11.525 --> 18:14.093
Which part do you want me
to deal with first, Mom?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.833
Watch your tone,
young lady! Jen!

18:15.877 --> 18:17.705
[Jennifer grunts]

18:17.748 --> 18:19.620
-[flesh searing]
-[crying in pain]

18:22.405 --> 18:24.233
Mom, are you okay?

18:24.277 --> 18:27.367
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.
-[gasps, whispers]

18:31.719 --> 18:33.851
[Lynn] Jen. Jen!

18:33.895 --> 18:35.897
[winces, panting]

18:44.384 --> 18:46.168
[sniffling]

18:49.215 --> 18:50.477
Jen.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.828
It's okay.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.703
We'll figure it out, okay?
I promise.

18:59.747 --> 19:00.835
[sniffles]

19:03.229 --> 19:05.448
It's okay. I'm okay.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.977
It's like our daughter
has a disease.
[inhales sharply]

19:13.021 --> 19:16.242
Well, first it was a drug,
now it's a disease.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.983
I'm just saying that
you have a suit and powers,

19:19.027 --> 19:22.030
I have years of experience
as a doctor and a researcher

19:22.073 --> 19:23.205
and we're helpless.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.864
I went to Gambi
and I asked him to pull
some strings at the ASA

19:29.907 --> 19:31.518
to put me
in charge of the pods.

19:37.263 --> 19:40.396
-What are you doing, Lynn?
-I'm doing what you do.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.225
I'm using my gifts to help
Freeland, help those children.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.227
Look, we already
talked about this.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.534
You've seen how
duplicitous and dangerous
those people can be.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.362
Yes, unfortunately, I have.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.190
I just can't believe you.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.192
You went and talked to Gambi
without coming to me first.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.282
I don't need your permission
to talk to anyone.
I'm not a child.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.764
If you were
so concerned about me,

20:00.808 --> 20:02.592
why haven't you
mentioned even once

20:02.636 --> 20:05.378
that I killed a man
and how I felt about it?

20:05.421 --> 20:09.469
But you have a problem
with me going to Gambi
and helping those children?

20:09.512 --> 20:13.124
What, do I need powers,
a fancy suit, a funny name

20:13.168 --> 20:15.039
for you to understand
what I'm trying to do?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.303
Seeing what just happened
to Jennifer down there

20:17.346 --> 20:20.915
makes me positive
I made the right choice.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.789
This thing
is tearing us apart.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.619
I told you
there would be consequences.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.929
I'm gonna take a drive.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.676
-Are you kidding me?
-I don't know.

23:02.859 --> 23:06.776
I asked myself,
now what could possibly keep

23:06.820 --> 23:13.174
Jefferson Pierce away
from Garfield High
after it was attacked?

23:14.567 --> 23:16.264
Nothing.

was already there.

24:44.047 --> 24:44.744
Hmm?

24:46.920 --> 24:49.531
Come on, man!
I asked you a question.

24:52.752 --> 24:53.927
[sighs]

24:55.015 --> 24:56.364
Yes.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.284

James Marion Sims,
the so-called father
of modern gynecology,

25:37.623 --> 25:41.104
experimented on female slaves
without anesthesia.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.629
Well, because of
Black Lightning and Thunder,

25:43.672 --> 25:47.589
people all over the world
will be exposed
to the same truth

25:47.633 --> 25:51.637
that people who reside
in communities like Freeland
know all too well.

25:51.680 --> 25:57.120
And that is,
the government has used
poor communities, poor people

25:57.164 --> 26:00.602
as guinea pigs for
all kinds of experimentation.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.604
[newscaster] The problem is,
government officials

26:02.648 --> 26:04.737
have always looked down
on this town.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.304
Ever since they started using
these people for experiments,

26:07.348 --> 26:10.307
they don't even see them
as people. Just...

26:10.351 --> 26:11.439
You came back.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.312
I went back to my place...

26:17.750 --> 26:19.665
and figured there was
no better place to be.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.898
This one shot.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.686
That's one of the reasons
why I went to Gambi.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.297
Stop all this madness
on the streets of Freeland.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.083
I'm going to help
those children, Jefferson.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.433
I don't need your support,

26:49.477 --> 26:51.305
but it would be nice
to have it.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.573
[Jefferson sighs]

26:59.792 --> 27:04.318
All this negative news,
on metas,

27:04.361 --> 27:07.669
Freeland is gonna start
turning on folks with powers.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.890
That is the future, Lynn,
for Jen and Anissa.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.195
Eventually,
they will be hunted.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.284
If not by the police,
then by the ASA--

27:14.328 --> 27:16.983
Hey. We're gonna
get through this,

27:18.201 --> 27:19.986
with our family intact.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.122
Oh, breaking news...

27:27.820 --> 27:29.038
Henderson knows.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.171
What?

27:32.346 --> 27:35.175
Oh, my God. How?

27:35.218 --> 27:38.918
He's a smart man.
Too many clues.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.790
[sighs]

27:41.834 --> 27:42.878
Wow.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.054
I mean, I could
have denied it all

27:45.098 --> 27:48.623
and come up with a bunch
of reasons why it wasn't true,

27:48.667 --> 27:53.672
but honestly, I was just too
tired to lie to him anymore.

27:56.152 --> 27:59.199
He's a good man
and a good friend.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.028
Might be someone
good to talk to.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.465
I don't know if he'd ever want
to talk to me again.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.818
Anyone who knows
who Black Lightning is
winds up getting hurt.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.908
Physically, emotionally.

28:12.952 --> 28:16.390
[chuckles]
Now I have him to worry about.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.132
Yeah, I know we talked about
Jennifer seeing a therapist.

28:19.175 --> 28:22.701
But maybe
you should see one, too.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.618
You think I'm crazy?

28:27.662 --> 28:29.490
Well, I know you're crazy.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.276
[chuckles] I just...
I think you've been through
a lot of stuff.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.539
Not just in
the last few months,
but over the years.

28:35.583 --> 28:38.891
Fighting for Freeland,
and Garfield and...

28:38.934 --> 28:42.546
You're a man of a certain age.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.506
-[chuckles]
-And a lot of guys
lose their ability

28:45.549 --> 28:49.771
to get an erection
when they're stressed, so...

28:49.815 --> 28:52.774
Maybe it wasn't the suit
that caused your powers
to short-circuit.

28:52.818 --> 28:57.170
Maybe it was
Black Lightning's version
of erectile dysfunction.

29:00.695 --> 29:04.830
-Gah. Woman, ain't nothin'
dysfunctional about me.
-[laughing]

29:04.873 --> 29:07.354
-Really?
-Oh, really, yeah.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.968
You know, um...
[clears throat]

29:13.012 --> 29:14.056
[remote clicks]

29:14.100 --> 29:17.886
I am cool testing out
your theory.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.322
I bet you are.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.890
-Dr. Lynn Stewart.
-[chuckling]

29:21.934 --> 29:24.327
See, I have an idea

29:24.371 --> 29:27.896
about how you can
help me with my stress.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.029
-Aw! [laughing]
-Yeah.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.670
[sighs deeply]

30:06.892 --> 30:07.893
[beeps]

30:10.721 --> 30:11.940
What? It's Kara.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.073
She was Proctor's spotter.

30:14.116 --> 30:17.119
I knew I recognized the face,
but I couldn't figure out
from where.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.121
She came to see me,
offered up Proctor's briefcase

30:19.165 --> 30:21.341
in return for me cleansing her
from the ASA.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.014
This is completely...

30:44.146 --> 30:45.539
I mean...

30:46.670 --> 30:48.020
[sighs]

30:49.499 --> 30:50.370
Okay.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.721
[breathes deeply]

30:53.764 --> 30:57.246
Does she know who has it?
What's in the briefcase?

30:57.290 --> 30:58.900
Probably. She's not saying.

30:58.944 --> 31:03.296
But whatever it is,
it's probably worse
than we think.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.733
You think she can get it?

31:07.082 --> 31:07.953
We'll see.

31:09.955 --> 31:13.175
-[sighs] Yeah.
Any word on Tobias?
-Still off the grid.

31:13.219 --> 31:17.876
I'm keeping tabs
on Khalil's mom's place.
I think he's the wild card.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.447
-[Kiesha laughing] No, girl,
I'm serious. I'm serious.
-[Jennifer chuckles]

31:24.491 --> 31:25.927
He got me
all up in my feelings.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.755
I don't even really
like him like that.

31:27.798 --> 31:30.018
Honestly, it's just...
It's the thought
of him thinking

31:30.062 --> 31:31.193
he gonna break up with me,
you know?

31:31.237 --> 31:32.978
I already told you
you too good for him.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.588
-I've been telling you that.
-I know.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.285
-[Kiesha chuckles]
-[cell phone chimes]

31:39.158 --> 31:41.160
Dudes have no kind of shame.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.945
Ain't he got better things
to do with the police
looking for him?

31:43.989 --> 31:46.078
Yeah. Yeah, you would think.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.211
Girl, listen.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.387
[Khalil] You were right, J.
That stuff at Garfield,
that wasn't me.

31:51.431 --> 31:55.261
Look, if you could
please just give me
a chance to explain...

31:55.304 --> 31:57.567
[Kiesha] Oh, um, boy, bye.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.482
I mean,
did you tell the police
that he's harassing you?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.615
No. I already have
enough drama in my life
with my parents.

32:01.658 --> 32:02.964
I don't need more.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.487
Yeah, I feel that.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.315
The police gonna catch
his ass eventually.

32:06.359 --> 32:09.144
I just keep his messages
to remind myself
not to talk to him again.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.233
Well, all these
Green Light babies

32:11.277 --> 32:13.148
walking around
with powers and whatnot...

32:13.192 --> 32:15.150
I mean, it's like
the end of days.

32:15.194 --> 32:16.978
All of them, they gonna end up
like that boy that
the police choked out.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.241
And Neema's still missing,
and all those other kids

32:19.285 --> 32:23.202
from back in the day
that were experimented on,
they're all freaks.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.292
End of days, girl.
I'm telling you.

32:28.207 --> 32:31.166
Yeah. Put your head back.

32:31.210 --> 32:35.170
So we, um, talking here
about consequences.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.695
Everything that you do
has a consequence.

32:38.739 --> 32:44.266
So we're here
in Romans chapter three,
verse 21 and 22,

32:44.310 --> 32:46.268
and let's see
what God has to say.

32:46.312 --> 32:52.448
"But now the righteousness
of God, without the law
is manifested,

32:53.928 --> 32:54.842
-being--"
-[door opens]

33:01.283 --> 33:03.982
-[guns cocking]
-[all gasp]

33:05.505 --> 33:07.072
Whoa, you won't
be needing that.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.074
God willing, we won't.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.255
[all gasp]

33:36.101 --> 33:38.886
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.152
[Issa's mother sobbing]
Jesus! You see this?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.154
Jesus, do you see this?

33:46.198 --> 33:49.157
They won't even let me
bury my baby right.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.854
-[muffled grunting]
-[man] What the...

33:50.898 --> 33:52.073
Stop.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.248
[all gasping]

33:53.292 --> 33:54.249
Oh, my God.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.208
[grunting]

33:57.644 --> 33:58.558
No...

33:59.559 --> 34:00.821
[gasping]

34:00.864 --> 34:02.736
Issa? Wait.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.259
[women whimpering]

34:04.303 --> 34:06.261
Stay... Stay away! Stay away!

34:06.305 --> 34:09.090
This can't be real.
Jesus, this can't be real.

34:09.134 --> 34:13.138
Jesus, what is this?
Show me the way.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.141
[gasping] No, you... I don't
want anything to do with you.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.577
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.623
No. You can't be my baby.
My baby is dead.

34:20.667 --> 34:24.627
No, I was relieved
when you died.
I was happy to bury you.

34:24.671 --> 34:29.067
I was happy not to be
worried about you on these
streets doing Green Light.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.677
No, I was happy.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.113
Mom!

34:32.157 --> 34:33.245
[stammers]

34:35.247 --> 34:38.119
[faint crackling]

34:38.163 --> 34:41.644
I'm sorry.
[stammers] I was confused.

34:41.688 --> 34:44.386
I didn't mean
to say these words.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.084
-Get on the ground.
-[Issa's mother] No, wait.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.738
Run. Issa, run!

34:48.782 --> 34:50.349
-No, wait. No!
-[man] Stop!

34:50.392 --> 34:51.567
-[Issa's mother] No!
-[gunshots]

34:51.611 --> 34:53.308
[Jennifer laughs]
It's so funny.

34:53.352 --> 34:56.311
[chuckles] Wait. Look at her.

34:56.355 --> 34:59.140
-She's so crazy,
I'm dying.
-[laughing]

34:59.184 --> 35:01.099
She is crazy.
I love it, though.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.274
Oh, my God.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.320
This one's funny, too.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.321
Oh, hell, no.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.019
-What?
-Look!

35:09.063 --> 35:12.327
So now they jumping
out of body bags
and coming back from the dead?

35:12.371 --> 35:13.676
Oh, my God.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.026
I'm telling you, girl,
end of days.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.160
Look. Look at him.
All these Green Light babies
are freaks.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.945
That is ridiculous. You...

35:21.989 --> 35:22.990
J!

35:25.253 --> 35:27.908
-J, what's up?
-[gasping]

35:27.951 --> 35:29.866
Jennifer, what is it?
What's wrong?

35:29.910 --> 35:31.955
Hey, come on, Jennifer,
you're scaring me.
Open the door.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.219
Come on, Jennifer,
open the door.
You're scaring me.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.003
Kiesha, go home, okay?

35:36.046 --> 35:39.137
-[doorknob rattling]
-Jen, what's up?
Talk to me. Jennifer!

35:39.180 --> 35:40.399
Kiesha, go home!

35:40.442 --> 35:42.140
[faint crackling]

35:44.403 --> 35:47.319
I don't give a rat's ass
who pulled strings for you,

35:47.362 --> 35:51.105
but I guaran-damn-tee you
I will find out.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.022
Cut those strings and you are
gonna fall hard, lady.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.371
It's Dr. Stewart.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.417
Oh. Supposed to impress me?

35:58.460 --> 36:02.421
Like you said,
I don't give a rat's ass
if it does or it doesn't.

36:02.464 --> 36:06.164
Like crack,
this community will have
to deal with the consequences

36:06.207 --> 36:08.470
of the government
experimenting on them
for generations to come.

36:08.514 --> 36:12.126
I just want
to give them the answers
and the tools to do that.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.043
[chuckling]

36:18.132 --> 36:21.048
I'm gonna find out
what's really going on
with you, Doctor.

36:22.963 --> 36:23.964
I will.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.541
[exhales shakily]

36:37.934 --> 36:40.676
-Where is she?
-She's in the bathroom.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.071
Jeff, I've never seen
anything like this before.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.814
Okay. Okay. Okay.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.251
Jen?

36:50.295 --> 36:52.384
[faint humming and crackling]

37:08.487 --> 37:09.749
Baby, are you in pain?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.056
No.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.015
I just can't stop it.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.803
[exhales deeply]

37:20.847 --> 37:22.588
Okay, I need you to
get out of the tub.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.766
No, I... I got you.

37:29.638 --> 37:30.944
[Jefferson grunts]

37:49.919 --> 37:50.920
[door opens]

38:10.200 --> 38:12.290
[Napier] Jefferson,
did you hear me?

38:15.031 --> 38:19.993
I said they voted
to close Garfield permanently.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.649
Yeah, I heard you.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.088
I'll step down as principal.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.309
[Napier sighs]

38:34.616 --> 38:38.316
[stutters] It'll give
the board a win.

38:40.753 --> 38:46.585
They can hire whoever
they feel comfortable with
to run Garfield

38:46.628 --> 38:50.676
and it'll look like
they've taken decisive action.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.721
And, uh, the media...

38:53.940 --> 38:54.941
[chuckles dryly]

38:56.203 --> 39:01.382
The media will eat it...
and me up.

39:01.426 --> 39:05.995
You sure? Do you want me
to take that back to them?

39:09.434 --> 39:11.218
You said it best, Napier.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.440
Like Black Lightning
and Thunder...

39:16.789 --> 39:18.747

41:02.634 --> 41:04.505
No more words.

41:05.637 --> 41:06.812
Time to die.

41:07.595 --> 41:08.727
If you must.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.033
[gasps]

41:11.077 --> 41:12.818
[screaming]

41:22.741 --> 41:26.266
I'm gonna peel
your skin off with
a butter knife, you bitch.

41:26.309 --> 41:27.702
[grunts]

41:31.097 --> 41:32.838
-[screaming]
-[grunting]

41:36.450 --> 41:37.799
[gasping]

41:38.844 --> 41:41.020
[grunts, screams]

41:43.892 --> 41:46.242
[grunting angrily]
