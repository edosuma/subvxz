00:30.322 --> 00:31.740
What's up?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.410
Davis, what's up?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.496
I'm home.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.457
I had to bring it back here.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.878
Netflix said, "Where do you want
to do the special? LA, Chicago, New York?"

00:44.962 --> 00:47.381
I was like, "Nah, son. Davis California."

00:51.176 --> 00:52.719
This has, um...

00:53.387 --> 00:55.889
This has been a very good year for me.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.933
I recently got married, you guys.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.726
Thank you, thank you.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.895
Thank you. I need the claps.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.105
It's a very heavy ring. Very heavy.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.650
It was a reverse
<i>Lord of the Rings </i> situation.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.819
I got a ring and then lost my powers,

01:08.902 --> 01:11.488
which is a very different
<i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.865
"Listening? Compromise?
Take the ring, Sam."

01:13.949 --> 01:18.787
The movie is done in eight minutes.
It's not a 90-hour saga.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.331
We just celebrated
our one-year anniversary,

01:21.415 --> 01:24.126
so it's one year down, forever to go.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.713
Which is terrifying to say.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.216
But you know what's great?
Now, it's just kind of liberating.

01:31.717 --> 01:35.762
Because I don't give a fuck
about any of my single friends.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.683
I don't care about any of you
and it feels great.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.270
Because you guys are at home,
just swiping for love,

01:43.353 --> 01:44.813
and complaining.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.565
"Oh, how do you find people?"

01:46.648 --> 01:50.152
"Dimples? Off with his head!"
Like a god-damn emperor.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.903
"Brunettes? Not for me."

01:51.987 --> 01:55.157
I'm like, "You work at Subway.
You don't deserve so much choice."

01:55.240 --> 01:56.950
We're getting soft.

01:57.034 --> 02:00.787
You realize my parents
physically never saw each other?

02:00.871 --> 02:04.458
Thirty years ago in a town in India,
population 990,000 -

02:04.541 --> 02:05.751
that's a small town -

02:05.834 --> 02:10.047
my dad heard a buzz in the streets
about this woman named Seema, my mom.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.550
And, like,
Seema was that chick, you guys.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.677
In '82, Seema could get...

02:15.761 --> 02:18.263
Look at that red <i>langa</i>. Killing it!

02:20.015 --> 02:21.642
She was like the iPhone 8.

02:21.725 --> 02:25.479
"Have you heard of Seema?
She's slim. Her family owns a camera."

02:25.562 --> 02:27.689
My dad was like, "A camera?"

02:27.773 --> 02:31.068
So he runs to my grandfather's house
and lays it on the line.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.154
"I'm going to America.
I want to marry Seema. YOLO."

02:34.237 --> 02:39.326
In ten minutes, the man married a woman
he had never laid eyes on.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.746
You understand?
That's Tinder with no photos.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.375
"I want that for the rest of my life.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.543
I hope she has a good personality.

02:48.627 --> 02:52.464
Let's move to the US where we're
the only people that know each other."

02:53.423 --> 02:55.384
I'm so grateful for that decision.

02:55.842 --> 03:00.013
Najmi marries Question Mark,
they come to the States, I come out.

03:00.097 --> 03:04.434
Popping out of your mom is like
real estate. It's all about location.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.313
I popped out here. Anybody brown,
we popped out here, we made it.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.941
We're the rappers that made it.

03:13.276 --> 03:18.198
What's wild is, I never even knew how
the whole <i>X-Men Origins </i> story went down.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.369
It's crazy, because we know
nothing about our parents

03:22.452 --> 03:24.329
and our parents know nothing about us.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.832
"Dad, your favorite color?" "Stanford!"

03:26.915 --> 03:28.208
"What? No."

03:29.751 --> 03:34.131
"No, I want to know more about you."
"Why? Get into Stanford."

03:35.215 --> 03:38.885
And I think it's just that, like,
immigrants love secrets.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.555
Right? They love them.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.141
They love bottling them up deep down,

03:44.224 --> 03:47.310
and unleashing them on you later
when it's no longer relevant.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.898
"Mom's a ninja, Dad's a communist?
Why are you telling me this right now?"

03:52.357 --> 03:56.445
Every conversation with my dad
is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.990
It's just 90 minutes of build-up
to no payoff.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.243
"That's the ending?"

04:03.744 --> 04:07.539
So my dad marries my mom,
they come to the States, they have me,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.458
in Davis, California,

04:09.541 --> 04:13.086
but my mom has to go back to India
to finish up med school.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.047
So the first eight years,
it was just me and my dad.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.800
Just the two of us trying
to make it in America.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.052
Minus all the unconditional love.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.306
Brown love is very conditional.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.768
In the photo he's like,
"You had better get all As."

04:29.728 --> 04:31.438
Like, let's be real.

04:32.147 --> 04:35.776
I grew up here. Like, Pioneer...
I grew up here.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.859
Yeah.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.031
But Davis was, like, super white.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.908
Kind of like tonight.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.830
Roll call was a problem.
It was a big deal for a lot of us.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.875
- Like, what's your name?
- Jasura.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.794
Okay. What would you get?

04:53.877 --> 04:56.338
- Jasuriah.
- Jasuriah?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.132
Yeah. I would get, like,
"Hanson Minaja..."

04:59.633 --> 05:01.301
"Sahan Minha."

05:01.718 --> 05:03.845
"Saddam Hussein."

05:03.929 --> 05:06.097
It was my English teacher.
"I'm not Saddam."

05:06.181 --> 05:07.557
- What's your name?
- Biju.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.559
- What would you get?
- A blank stare.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.977
A blank stare?

05:12.854 --> 05:16.399
I'm the only brown kid at school,
Dad is the only brown guy at work.

05:16.483 --> 05:20.904
In a weird way that brings us together,
and we have to do everything together.

05:20.987 --> 05:25.367
Try to understand immigrant fathers.
I still can't understand some of you.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.994
There are uncles here.
None of you guys are smiling.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.413
I don't get it.
You're going to die. Laugh.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.457
Why aren't you laughing?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.918
You're always stressed and always tired.

05:35.001 --> 05:39.673
You could wake up any immigrant father
from a 12-hour nap, and they'd say...

05:42.509 --> 05:44.135
"Why do I have to pay taxes?"

05:44.219 --> 05:45.971
You're like, "Jesus..."

05:46.846 --> 05:50.350
We'd do everything...
I remember being in the grocery store.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.937
And we'd be walking through the aisles,
and my dad would pick up yogurt.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.356
"Ah, yogurt."

05:58.775 --> 06:01.027
Or milk. Just like, "Ah."

06:03.530 --> 06:07.450
And I'd look at him and be like,
"Oh, man. Dad hates yogurt."

06:09.202 --> 06:10.954
"He hates milk."

06:11.496 --> 06:13.790
But I get that look, now.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.876
Life is tough and sometimes
you don't know what you're doing.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.589
He has a little kid
and I'm not making his life any easier.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.924
I'm picking up soda and I'm like, "Ah!"

06:23.008 --> 06:25.427
"Don't do that."
"I'm going to live forever!"

06:25.510 --> 06:28.096
Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes

06:28.179 --> 06:31.057
and I would drop the soda
and it would explode.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.477
And then my dad would do
what most brown parents do.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.439
He would check
to see if the coast is clear...

06:39.524 --> 06:41.568
and he'd slap the shit out of me.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.322
I love it. Thank you. Thank you.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.907
Pockets were acknowledging that.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.868
And for the liberal white guilt,

06:49.951 --> 06:53.246
immigrants aren't going to hit
their children the way you do.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.874
Americans hit on the arm
and bruise the body.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.668
Immigrants slap your face
and bruise your soul.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.087
It's Guantanamo of the mind.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.259
And I know some of you guys are like,
"Hey, this is Davis, okay?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.596
I listen to NPR. Ira Glass says
children are our future."

07:09.679 --> 07:13.266
Have you seen the show called <i>The Slap</i> ?
This is a real show on NBC.

07:13.350 --> 07:18.355
This is a real show about a white kid
that gets slapped at a birthday party.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.148
Are you fucking kidding?

07:20.231 --> 07:23.902
Thirteen episodes for this kid?
Are you kidding me?

07:24.444 --> 07:28.448
Do you know when brown kids get slapped?
Every brown birthday party.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.993
And usually it's the kid
whose birthday it is,

07:32.077 --> 07:34.579
and we stand there and point and laugh.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.874
We go, "Ah,
Biju got slapped on his birthday!"

07:37.958 --> 07:41.419
And that's what makes us
tough and resilient.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.881
It's why we become cardiologists
and win spelling bees.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.218
Slapping is important.
It elevates your game.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.222
You ever seen an Indian kid
win a spelling bee?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.848
Incredible!

07:54.933 --> 07:57.394
Ice water in the veins.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.982
That kid won't choke on camera.
He's been slapped on camera.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.859
- Of course he can spell "knaidel".
- <i>Knaidel.</i>

08:04.943 --> 08:08.697
Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing!

08:09.656 --> 08:11.950
He's 12 years old. Nothing!

08:12.450 --> 08:16.579
This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing.

08:17.706 --> 08:22.252
People ask, "Where does that come from?"
Look at this kid's parents.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.423
Your son just won
the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.302
Look at his brother. His brother is like,
"I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.929
The bar is way too high.
I should kill myself."

08:34.014 --> 08:36.099
People say, "Where's Bobby Jindal from?"

08:36.182 --> 08:39.144
That's where he comes from.
That is an Indian sociopath.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.274
I know what happens
when I talk about this.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.943
People say, "Your parents don't love you."

08:47.027 --> 08:49.487
I think our parents love us.
We have great fathers.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.867
I just think our fathers didn't download
all the great dad software.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.995
There are just a few apps missing.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.873
Birthdays aren't their thing.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.169
Every immigrant father feels like
if they brought you to the US...

09:05.587 --> 09:07.297
Happy Birthday.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.216
Starbucks, Wi-Fi, freeways,
happy birthday.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.677
No more birthdays. Go be president.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.514
At an interview, this lady said,
"Describe your earliest birthday memory."

09:16.598 --> 09:18.516
I was like, "Do I have to?"

09:18.600 --> 09:20.602
So I'm six, I'm turning seven.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.313
My dad wakes me up
super early in the morning.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.856
"Hasan, get up!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.274
Get in the Camry."

09:26.900 --> 09:28.443
The immigrant car of choice.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.489
We get in the Camry, we're driving
from Davis to Sacramento.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.116
There's one mall in the entire area.
Arden.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.785
We get to this intersection,

09:37.327 --> 09:39.454
and I look to my left,

09:39.537 --> 09:42.082
and it's the one place
every kid dreams about.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.792
Toys 'R' Us.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.919
I was like, "Oh, shit!

09:46.002 --> 09:48.713
Dad saw the Toys 'R' Us catalog
on my wall.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.674
He saw my vision board.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.638
He saw the blue BMX bike I wanted.
He's here to surprise me.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.808
Turn left. Turn left.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.477
Turn... left."

10:03.520 --> 10:05.271
Then he turns right,

10:05.355 --> 10:07.524
and I'm like, "Home Depot?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.193
No!"

10:10.276 --> 10:13.613
I'm like, "Why are we here?
Do you know what day it is?"

10:13.696 --> 10:14.739
"It's Saturday."

10:14.823 --> 10:17.575
"No, it's my birthday. Did you forget?"

10:17.659 --> 10:20.912
He's like, "Hasan, how could I forget
that it's your birthday?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.706
That's why I brought you here.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.127
So you could pick the door handle
for the bathroom."

10:28.795 --> 10:34.300
And I was like, "Why don't you
have me pick out the toilet?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.177
You are shitting on my dreams."

10:36.261 --> 10:40.140
I didn't say that. I would have gotten
a slap. I wanted to say that.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.349
That's when I realized

10:41.432 --> 10:44.144
there's a generational gap
between us and our parents.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.479
You're going to fight with your parents,

10:47.063 --> 10:49.566
and there's a finite number
of hands you can play.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.067
You know about this.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.528
Not going to be a doctor?
That's a hand.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.740
Marry a white girl?
Boom! That's a big hand.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.079
I could have been like,
"Dad, fight me. I want that bike."

11:03.163 --> 11:06.666
But I was like, "Hang on to your cards.
You'll need them later."

11:06.749 --> 11:09.085
Like, I had vision as a six-year-old.

11:09.878 --> 11:14.048
And my mom, she would come and visit,
and just kill the mom game.

11:14.132 --> 11:18.678
One year, she came to school and
brought me a <i>Ghostbusters </i> proton pack.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.140
The wheelie thing, the backpack,
the gun that catches ghosts...

11:22.223 --> 11:24.309
Literally shut Pioneer down.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.980
Kids were losing their minds. "What?
Saddam Hussein's a Ghostbuster?"

11:29.063 --> 11:32.317
"Yeah, I'm a brown Ghostbuster.
Deal with it."

11:32.400 --> 11:34.360
One of the happiest days of my life.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.323
But then she would go back to India.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.742
That's when I realized I don't want a toy.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.369
I just want my mom. I want to be a family.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.873
I was very emo. I was like Drake.
I missed that girl.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.209
"When is she coming back?
I need her in my life.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.381
I need her. I need that girl.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.800
I need that girl in my life.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.553
I need her, Dad.
She used to call me on my phone."

12:00.637 --> 12:03.222
My dad's like,
"When the visa comes through."

12:03.306 --> 12:05.850
"When the visa comes through."
It's a big deal.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.812
I don't care what anyone says.
It's difficult to get in this country.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.690
It's not like a broken condom
where you're like, "I'm in!"

12:13.816 --> 12:15.568
Eight years.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.780
August 11th, 1993. I'm so excited.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.533
I put on my <i>Ghostbusters </i> proton pack.
I'm standing there.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.494
Dad goes, "Put on Indian clothes."

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578
I'm like, "Alright.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.747
I can be an Indian ghostbuster."

12:29.624 --> 12:32.251
I put on a <i>Salwar Kameez</i>.
I'm standing there.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.963
Door opens.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.756
Dad walks through.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.258
Mom walks through.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.011
And then immediately behind my mom,

12:42.095 --> 12:45.306
is this little brown girl
with a mushroom cut.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.184
She runs up to me and hugs me.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.811
"Hasan <i> bhai</i>!"

12:50.979 --> 12:53.439
And I'm in full hover-hands mode,

12:53.523 --> 12:55.984
because I have no idea who this person is.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.403
What happened was,

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
my dad

13:00.071 --> 13:02.365
would go back and forth to India
to visit my mom,

13:03.366 --> 13:05.618
and during one trip he knocked her up.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.955
And I had a sister.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.251
But no one told me about it.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.050
Remember how I told you
that immigrants love secrets?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.302
This is a secret that nobody told me!

13:23.386 --> 13:24.554
He says, "Hug her."

13:24.637 --> 13:27.056
"You brought her out
like <i>Maury </i> for immigrants."

13:27.140 --> 13:30.435
"Hasan, you are the brother."
I'm like, "No, no!"

13:30.518 --> 13:33.646
She was breakdancing,
and I'm like, "Who the fuck are you?"

13:33.730 --> 13:36.024
"You don't know me?"
"I've no idea who you are."

13:36.107 --> 13:38.693
I hated that brown girl so much.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.362
I was like, "Build that wall."

13:41.446 --> 13:44.907
I was like a little Republican.
I was like, "I get it."

13:44.991 --> 13:47.368
I remember leveling with my parents
at dinner.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.537
"Look, Mom, Dad, let's just be real.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.290
Oh, my God, these brown people...
Oh, jeez.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.168
Coming into our house...

13:57.086 --> 13:58.880
eating our Fruit Roll-Ups...

14:00.298 --> 14:02.175
they don't speak the language...

14:02.925 --> 14:05.803
I say we tell them to go back
where they came from."

14:05.887 --> 14:08.556
He's like, "You can't say that.
We're family."

14:08.639 --> 14:10.767
I'm like, "No, that's on you and Mom.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.437
You guys decided to get
your Angelina Jolie on,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.147
and bring over this FOB.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.107
That's on you, that's not on me."

14:18.191 --> 14:20.651
Why do you do this to your daughters?

14:20.735 --> 14:25.448
Every single brown mother makes your
daughter <i>quinceañera </i> dress, chop cuts.

14:25.531 --> 14:29.077
Why? Princess from here down,
Toad from here up.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.164
I've got this shit following me around
on the playground. "Hasan <i>bhai</i>!"

14:33.247 --> 14:34.707
I'm like, "Yo, kick rocks!"

14:34.791 --> 14:37.543
I go play tetherball. "Hasan <i>bhai</i>!"
"Get lost!"

14:37.627 --> 14:41.714
Eventually, I run to the boys' bathroom.
She follows me into the bathroom.

14:41.798 --> 14:42.799
"Hasan <i> bhai</i>!"

14:42.882 --> 14:45.176
All the kids at the urinal are like, "Uh!

14:45.635 --> 14:47.178
What's <i>Hasan-bye</i> ?"

14:47.261 --> 14:51.849
I went to school with a bunch
of Ryan Lochtes. Just all traps.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.645
"Uh, I don't
understand other cultures, bro.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.355
What is that? What does it mean?"

14:57.438 --> 15:00.358
It's a term of endearment in my culture,
meaning "brother".

15:00.441 --> 15:01.484
"Shut up, Cody!"

15:01.567 --> 15:04.070
I took that anger and channeled it at her.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.279
I was like, "Hey!

15:05.780 --> 15:07.198
You're not my sister."

15:08.950 --> 15:10.868
But she couldn't understand English.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.499
But she got what I was saying.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.918
She starts crying and runs out.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.503
I was like, "No!

15:21.337 --> 15:23.131
She's going to tell Dad."

15:24.966 --> 15:27.301
Let's focus on what's important here.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.428
But she didn't.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.971
And my dad...

15:30.054 --> 15:33.349
It was her first birthday in the US.
She was turning five.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.853
So for her first birthday,
he wanted it to be special.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
I can imagine being a father,

15:39.021 --> 15:42.567
missing your daughter's first steps,
her first time saying "Dada..."

15:42.650 --> 15:43.985
That's a hard thing.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.071
So for her birthday,
he brings everyone into the living room.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.616
He drags in this big box
and goes, "Aisha, open the box."

15:50.700 --> 15:53.369
She cuts open the box
and unfurls one of the flaps,

15:53.453 --> 15:57.665
and I see "Toys 'R' Us"
emblazoned on one of the flaps.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.376
And he reaches in,

16:00.460 --> 16:03.880
and pulls out a beautiful, blue BMX bike.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.010
"Here you go, Aisha." He looks at me.
"Happy Birthday."

16:14.765 --> 16:16.476
Savage, right?

16:16.559 --> 16:21.105
I'm livid. I'm like, "Yo, when did
Home Depot Dad become Danny Tanner?

16:21.189 --> 16:23.065
This is bullshit. Really?"

16:23.149 --> 16:24.066
I'm livid.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.654
And Aisha senses it. She's like,
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, why don't you take it out?"

16:29.280 --> 16:32.408
And as an elder brother,
I felt entitled to that bike.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.076
"That's my bike. Thank you."

16:34.160 --> 16:38.456
Younger siblings, you guys are worthless.
You bring nothing to the table.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.168
I see you getting mad.
"Hell, no. I have a personality."

16:42.251 --> 16:45.129
Where do you think
you got that from, dummy? Us.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.256
Clothes, culture, money.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.468
"Whoa! I have opinions."
No, you don't.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.471
And then you have the audacity
to be, like,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.515
"Hey, why are you so melodramatic?"

16:55.598 --> 16:59.310
Because I went to war for you.
Mom and Dad was my Vietnam.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.562
And you're like, "Everybody loves me."

17:01.646 --> 17:03.231
It's such bullshit, right?

17:03.314 --> 17:06.358
Elder siblings,
we walk through the world like,

17:06.442 --> 17:07.902
"Do people love me?"

17:07.984 --> 17:11.405
And you're like, "Mom and Dad
fucked up with you, not with me."

17:13.950 --> 17:17.328
She's like, "Take it for one lap
around the block."

17:19.288 --> 17:22.333
I grab those handlebars,
I'm like, "Fuck that noise."

17:22.415 --> 17:25.711
Boom. I take off.
She's like, "Hasan <i>bhai</i>, come back!"

17:25.795 --> 17:28.589
I'm like, "Eat my dust, immigrant."
I'm flying.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.342
I see a curb. I'm about to pop a wheelie.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.094
The bike goes left, I go right.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.429
And that beautiful blue BMX bike...

17:35.513 --> 17:38.391
Bam! It crashes into the cement.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.686
All the paint is chipped off
the right side of the bike.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.479
I pick it up,

17:44.188 --> 17:45.773
and it's destroyed.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.858
I hear the patter of her chappals.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.945
She's crying,
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, why would you do this?"

17:51.028 --> 17:53.322
Animé tears of innocence.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.075
"Why? I gave you the first ride."

17:56.576 --> 17:58.619
And I'm looking down at her,

17:58.703 --> 18:00.454
and I'm like, "Man...

18:01.247 --> 18:02.999
I'm being a dick."

18:04.041 --> 18:06.002
Like, this whole time

18:06.085 --> 18:09.463
I was looking for acceptance
from Cody, Corey and Cole...

18:13.509 --> 18:16.137
and I had it right here
this entire time.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.180
I'm supposed to be her big brother,

18:18.264 --> 18:21.350
help her navigate the American dream
and protect her.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.104
And I'm out here stealing her bike?
This is fucked up.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.481
And Aisha hates that story.

18:27.898 --> 18:32.153
She's always like, "Oh, my God,
you are so melodramatic.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.197
You make me sound like a refugee baby."

18:35.281 --> 18:38.200
That's true. I'm doing that right now.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.245
It's not fair,
because she's not a refugee.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.789
And, like, she learned English.

18:44.707 --> 18:48.794
She went to an Ivy League law school.
She does mergers and acquisitions now.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.838
She is the one percent.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.548
Meanwhile, I...

18:53.382 --> 18:55.384
I didn't go to grad school.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.762
I became a comedian. This is what I do.

18:58.429 --> 19:02.016
And then, when it came time
for me to get married,

19:02.099 --> 19:05.061
I got married to a girl
from a Hindu family.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.564
I heard an audible "Oh!" Alright.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.109
Fuck. I heard you go, like, "Ugh!"
I didn't punch you.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.820
Damn!

19:14.904 --> 19:16.656
So some of you guys don't know.

19:16.739 --> 19:20.326
Hindus and Muslims are like
the Montagues and Capulets of India.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.453
We've been warring for centuries.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.373
You're like, "What's the difference?
You look the same."

19:25.456 --> 19:28.084
So how do I explain this?
Hindus and Muslims.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.252
So Hindus...

19:30.336 --> 19:34.548
Hindus don't eat beef.
"No beef!" Right?

19:34.632 --> 19:38.469
And Muslims, we don't eat pork.
"Is that pepperoni pizza? No.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.471
No pepperoni!"

19:40.554 --> 19:43.182
And then Hindus, they like statues.

19:43.766 --> 19:47.520
They're like, "Oh!
This is a statue of an elephant.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.106
I'm going to put this in my car."

19:58.197 --> 20:01.951
Muslims are like, "No statues!
Calligraphy! We're about the alphabet.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.705
We put that in our car.
We're different."

20:05.788 --> 20:08.457
And then Hindus, they like cartoons.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.002
They're like,
"Oh, this is a cartoon Ganesh.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.422
I'll just put this on the wall."

20:14.922 --> 20:16.590
And Muslims...

20:17.466 --> 20:21.303
we don't really, uh, like cartoons.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.223
We've got to get better
about our cartoon policy.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.518
Because of this we've been killing
each other for centuries.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.896
And I know the older generation
doesn't like those jokes.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.649
"Pakistan was created
because of this reason."

20:33.733 --> 20:35.234
I know, but...

20:36.569 --> 20:37.486
I convinced my dad.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.613
"Dad, I love her, she loves me.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.574
Isn't there something bigger

20:41.657 --> 20:45.077
that unites all of us
outside of race, color, creed, class?

20:45.161 --> 20:49.415
This is America. We can choose what
we want to adhere from the motherland.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.461
Isn't life like <i>biryani</i>, where you push
the weird shit to the side?

20:53.544 --> 20:57.089
Why do we got to adhere
to this weird shit from back over there?

20:57.173 --> 20:58.215
He agrees.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.884
He's like, "That's a good point.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.386
Fine. You should get married."

21:02.470 --> 21:05.347
That's a Hall of Fame brown dad decision.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.309
There's brown dads here, like,
"If my son did that,

21:08.392 --> 21:10.895
I would shoot myself and then shoot him."

21:10.978 --> 21:12.646
He says yes.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.649
We rally the troops,
Me, Mom, Dad, Aisha,

21:15.733 --> 21:18.986
we get in the Camry,
we're driving to my fiancée's house.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.281
And we're about to pull up
and we get to the door,

21:23.532 --> 21:25.451
and my dad is about to ring the doorbell,

21:25.951 --> 21:27.328
when he says the sentence

21:27.411 --> 21:30.581
that is the killer
of every brown kid's dream.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.626
He goes,

21:34.835 --> 21:36.962
"I don't think we should do this.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.799
<i>Log kya kahenge</i> ?

21:41.550 --> 21:43.260
"What will people think?"

21:44.720 --> 21:46.180
I don't know if you know,

21:46.263 --> 21:49.391
but every time a brown father
says <i>log kya kahenge</i>,

21:49.475 --> 21:51.477
a star actually falls from the sky.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.272
"I don't want to be a doctor!"
<i>"Log kya kahenge!</i>"

21:55.356 --> 21:56.816
No!

21:57.817 --> 22:00.027
"I don't want to marry!"
<i>"Log kya kahenge!</i>"

22:00.110 --> 22:01.737
Why?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.532
I bet you,
when Mahatma Gandhi told his parents

22:04.615 --> 22:07.159
he was going to liberate India,

22:07.243 --> 22:10.079
even they were like, "<i>Log kya kahenge!</i>

22:10.579 --> 22:13.791
"Stop marching. The British
are going to talk shit about us.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.336
Why are you bald and skinny?
You're never going to get married."

22:17.419 --> 22:19.046
And I'm standing there...

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
on that doorstep.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.844
Wait, I'm standing there...

22:27.012 --> 22:28.597
on that doorstep,

22:28.681 --> 22:32.226
like, "Wait, you want me to change my life
because of <i>log kya kahenge</i> ?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.228
Come on, Dad.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.481
How many times do we complain
about racism in our community?

22:37.565 --> 22:38.566
All the time.

22:38.649 --> 22:41.902
Now the ball is in our court,
we're going to be bigoted?

22:41.986 --> 22:45.114
Dad, I promise you,
God doesn't like bigotry.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.866
God's not like, 'You're racist. Good job.'

22:47.950 --> 22:48.951
No!

22:49.034 --> 22:51.787
Number two, you want me
to change my life

22:51.870 --> 22:54.790
to appease some aunty and uncle
I'm never going to see?

22:54.873 --> 22:58.669
You want me to change my life
for Naila Aunty? Fuck Naila Aunty.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.421
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:00.963 --> 23:02.256
My life?"

23:03.716 --> 23:05.593
But I can't say that.

23:06.093 --> 23:10.264
Because I've played all my cards.
So I can't say anything.

23:10.764 --> 23:14.685
Now I'm losing hope.
I'm, like, "Maybe this is bigger than me.

23:14.768 --> 23:18.355
Why can't I put my head down
and do what I'm supposed to do?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.274
This ain't <i>Jodhaa Akbar</i>."

23:20.357 --> 23:23.652
Have you ever been trapped
by the time you live in?

23:23.736 --> 23:26.196
It's been going on for centuries.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.324
So I'm walking back to the Camry,

23:28.407 --> 23:30.284
then I hear a voice behind me.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.202
"Oh, my God.

23:32.953 --> 23:37.082
You guys do this all the time."

23:37.166 --> 23:40.169
And it is Aisha, and she is pissed.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.755
And she's like, "Dad,

23:42.838 --> 23:46.300
I did not fly out from Philly for this."

23:49.386 --> 23:51.764
"Beena is so legit.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.807
She has a PhD.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.226
Hasan <i>bhai </i> is a comedian."

24:00.939 --> 24:04.193
"No one is going to marry him.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.279
Get him married
before she changes her mind."

24:07.363 --> 24:10.949
She stepped up.
She laid down one of her cards for me.

24:11.033 --> 24:15.329
She Phil Jacksoned that situation.
She got all these people working together.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.248
Because of her,
I got to marry the love of my life.

24:18.332 --> 24:21.126
Because of my sister. I can't believe it.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.925
For years I resented that brown girl.
I hated her.

24:28.008 --> 24:31.428
But on that day, on that special day,

24:31.512 --> 24:34.264
I couldn't have been more proud
to be her Hasan <i>bhai</i>.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.870
You know, they say

24:56.954 --> 25:01.166
every generation is defined
by a great struggle or tragedy.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.837
And it's wild
that our kids will never know

25:04.920 --> 25:07.589
there was a period in time in this country

25:07.673 --> 25:09.633
where you had to make a choice

25:09.717 --> 25:12.761
between being on the internet
or being on the phone.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.434
They won't get it, dude.
You'll never get it.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.521
You don't get it, man. You won't.
That was our World War I, man.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.858
Especially in middle school,
if a girl called the house,

25:25.941 --> 25:28.694
you had to pick up the phone
before your parents.

25:29.653 --> 25:34.283
We used to have landlines.
It's like phones connected to the land.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.411
And one time in middle school
a girl called the house.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.329
My dad picked it up before me.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.706
"Hello, who is this?"

25:40.789 --> 25:44.126
"Hi, it's Alice. Is Hasan there?"
"What you want, Alice?"

25:44.209 --> 25:46.378
I was like, "I'm going to die a virgin."

25:47.880 --> 25:50.549
"I'm in Geometry with Hasan.
I had a question.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.426
Can I ask him the question?"

25:52.509 --> 25:54.470
He's like, "Okay, Alice.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.764
Why don't you ask me the question,

25:58.724 --> 26:00.684
then I'll ask Hasan?"

26:00.768 --> 26:02.895
That's the way our parents are.

26:02.978 --> 26:07.149
Ages zero through 30, "No girls!"
At 35, "Why can't you talk to girls?"

26:07.232 --> 26:09.693
That's basically it. "Ah, you kill me!"

26:11.528 --> 26:13.906
That's the way our parents are, right?

26:13.989 --> 26:18.076
Our parents are like a firewall
to the outside world.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.914
They disseminate information to us.
It's like living in North Korea.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.459
My dad is the leader of the household.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.170
So when 9-11 happened
I was in high school.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.172
My dad sits everybody down.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.424
He's like, "Hasan, whatever you do,

26:32.508 --> 26:35.677
do not tell people you're Muslim
or talk about politics."

26:35.761 --> 26:40.057
"Alright, Dad, I'll just hide it.
This just rubs off."

26:40.140 --> 26:42.351
We're sitting there. Phone rings.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.145
I run, but my dad beats me to the phone.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.439
"Hello?" I grab the second phone.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.692
I hear a voice. "Hey, you sand nigger,
where's Osama?"

26:52.319 --> 26:53.529
He looks at me.

26:54.238 --> 26:57.908
"You can hear me, right?
You fucking dune coon. Where's Osama?"

27:01.787 --> 27:04.998
"Hey, 2631 Regatta Lane,
that's where you live, right?

27:05.082 --> 27:07.334
I'm going to fucking kill you."
Click.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.462
And my dad's looking at me.

27:11.004 --> 27:15.884
Do you ever see your parents,
and you see the mortality in them?

27:16.635 --> 27:20.055
I'm looking at my dad
and I see all five-seven of him.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.726
And that's when I realize I'm a <i>darapok</i>.
I'm a scaredy-cat.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.564
We can speak two languages.
We can speak at home and outside.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.316
I should have said something. I didn't.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.695
We sit down.
I hear "thud, thud, thud" outside.

27:35.445 --> 27:39.324
Me and Dad run outside and all the windows
on the Camry are smashed in.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.161
My backpack's open.
"Fuck, they stole my stuff."

27:43.245 --> 27:45.497
I reach and I pull out my backpack.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.292
Pieces of glass get caught in my arm.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.794
Now blood is gushing down my arm,

27:50.878 --> 27:53.171
and I'm pissed, I'm fucking mad.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.423
Fuck this, man!

27:54.506 --> 27:58.760
These kids know where we live, they're
timing this, so they're watching us.

27:58.844 --> 28:02.014
So I'm looking in the trees, the bushes...

28:02.097 --> 28:06.310
I look back in the middle of the street,
my dad is in the middle of the road

28:06.393 --> 28:10.063
sweeping glass out of the road
like he works at a barbershop.

28:10.981 --> 28:14.443
"We've got customers. <i>Log kya kahenge?</i>
We've got to clean this up."

28:15.027 --> 28:16.278
Zen!

28:16.361 --> 28:19.072
Brown Mr Miyagi, just, like,
not saying a word.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.617
I'm like,
"Why aren't you saying something?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.827
I'm asking you, say something!"

28:24.620 --> 28:26.622
He looks at me and goes, "Hasan..."

28:33.462 --> 28:35.339
"These things happen,

28:35.881 --> 28:38.175
and these things will continue to happen.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.511
That's the price we pay for being here."

28:42.304 --> 28:46.141
That's when I was like, "We really are
from two different generations."

28:46.225 --> 28:48.018
BMX bikes aside.

28:48.477 --> 28:53.440
My dad's from that generation where
he feels like if you come to this country,

28:53.523 --> 28:55.400
you pay the American dream tax.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.946
You endure racism, and if it doesn't
cost you your life, pay it.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.405
There you go, Uncle Sam.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.367
But for me, I was born here.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.495
So I actually have the audacity
of equality.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.915
I'm like, "I'm in Honors Gov,
I have it right here.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.502
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.
All men created equal."

29:13.585 --> 29:15.462
It says it right here, I'm equal.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.422
I'm equal. I don't deserve this.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.760
But as soon as I say that...

29:23.679 --> 29:27.808
He looks at me like I believe in Santa.
"Hasan, you'll never understand."

29:27.891 --> 29:29.601
"I'll never understand?

29:29.685 --> 29:33.272
Dad, you're the guy that will argue
with the cashier at Costco

29:33.355 --> 29:35.691
when he doesn't let you return
used underwear.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.859
And now you want to be the bigger man?

29:37.943 --> 29:41.446
Now you're like, 'Let's be reasonable
with the bigots.' What?"

29:42.906 --> 29:46.702
And then he just walks back into the house
with glass in his feet.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.622
And I honestly don't know
who is more right.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.084
Maybe he's right. Put your head down.

29:54.167 --> 29:58.422
Be a doctor, get a house in the burbs,
let them call them whatever you want.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.759
But isn't it our job to push the needle
forward little by little?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.304
Isn't that how all this stuff happens?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.473
I don't know. The pendulum swings
back and forth for me.

30:08.557 --> 30:12.811
And I know 9/11 is a super touchy subject.
I understand.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.730
Because when it happened,

30:14.813 --> 30:18.442
everyone in America felt like
their country was under attack.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.653
But on that night, September 12th,

30:21.737 --> 30:24.448
it was the first night of so many nights

30:24.531 --> 30:27.993
where my family's loyalty to this country
was under attack.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.662
And it always sucks.

30:30.746 --> 30:34.916
As immigrants we always have
to put on these press releases

30:35.000 --> 30:36.376
to prove our patriotism.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.838
We're auditioning.
"We love this country, please believe me."

30:39.921 --> 30:42.215
Nobody loves this country more than us.

30:42.299 --> 30:45.052
I fell in love here.
Six years old, Janice Malo.

30:45.135 --> 30:48.305
I saw her in the sandbox.
I run up to her. First grade.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.891
"I love you!"
"You're the color of poop."

30:50.974 --> 30:52.976
That's memory number one.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.271
The first time you experience racism?

30:56.355 --> 30:59.858
I was like, "What? Oh, no!
It's not rubbing off!"

30:59.941 --> 31:01.360
I was fucking terrified.

31:01.443 --> 31:04.404
It was like <i>Inception</i>.
There were so many levels.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.615
I just wanted to wake up and be like,

31:06.698 --> 31:09.659
"Oh, it was all a dream. I'm JGL.
It was all a dream."

31:09.743 --> 31:12.829
But it's not a dream,
it's the universe telling you,

31:12.913 --> 31:15.957
"It's a Fair and Lovely world.
Navigate accordingly."

31:18.168 --> 31:22.923
In the third grade, Miss Anderson said,
"Write what you want to be."

31:23.006 --> 31:26.635
Some kids were like,
"an astronaut," or "a firefighter."

31:26.718 --> 31:28.387
I was like, "I want to be white."

31:30.138 --> 31:31.431
"What do you mean?"

31:31.515 --> 31:34.643
"I want this part of my skin
to be all of my skin."

31:36.019 --> 31:38.355
And it wasn't like, "I hate melanin."

31:38.438 --> 31:39.981
I love melanin.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.401
I've never gotten a sunburn. I'm blessed.

31:47.197 --> 31:50.826
But when you're white and you're
playing the video game of life,

31:51.326 --> 31:52.869
and your avatar is white,

31:52.953 --> 31:55.872
you just get asked less questions
along the way.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.375
You pop out. Boom.
"I want to be Batman."

31:58.458 --> 32:02.087
"Well, of course.
Batman is white. Duh!"

32:02.170 --> 32:03.839
"I want to be president."

32:03.922 --> 32:06.842
"Duh! Forty-four-and-a-half presidents
are white.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.803
We've had a great track record."

32:09.886 --> 32:15.142
And I know the privilege debate
is very heavy for white people.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.853
I know you guys have problems.
I've seen <i>Girls.</i>

32:21.481 --> 32:25.193
My dad did not give a shit
about any of this identity stuff.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.237
His rules with me were very simple.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.407
"No fun, no girlfriends.
Have fun in med school."

32:30.490 --> 32:34.035
Which is a huge lie.
It never gets popping in med school.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.873
I've never been to a club and seen
nine dudes: "Yo, what's going on?"

32:37.956 --> 32:40.542
"What's going on? Residency, fam!"

32:40.625 --> 32:42.043
Never happens.

32:42.127 --> 32:46.006
"I got a career I hate from my parents."
It's a lie. We buy into it.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.675
So by my senior year of high school,

32:48.758 --> 32:53.430
I had yet to go to a school dance,
I had been cut from the basketball team,

32:53.513 --> 32:56.349
and I had just got off
this medicine called Accutane

32:56.433 --> 32:58.435
so my skin and face was peeling.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.020
I'm crushing life.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.898
Out here, killing it. No one did that.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.942
Don't clap.
No one did that for that photo.

33:06.026 --> 33:09.654
No one ever did that at my school.
It's too late.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.782
But there was one bright spot,

33:12.866 --> 33:14.493
this girl named Bethany Reed.

33:14.576 --> 33:18.580
And her family had just moved
from Nebraska to Davis,

33:18.663 --> 33:20.790
and we were in AP Calc together, but...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.793
we had chemistry.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.630
She sat behind me,
first day, she's like,

33:26.713 --> 33:27.881
"Hey...

33:28.632 --> 33:30.342
what's your AIM screen name?"

33:31.551 --> 33:35.639
I was like, "It's about to go down.
Do you want it? I could give it to you."

33:35.722 --> 33:39.684
Whatever I lacked in real-life game,
my digital game... bananas.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.021
Status updates,
away messages, sub profile,

33:43.104 --> 33:45.732
Boyz II Men. Don't say
you don't like "Water Runs Dry".

33:45.815 --> 33:47.234
I was a lover.

33:47.317 --> 33:51.112
Late at night on AIM,
back and forth, back and forth...

33:51.196 --> 33:52.739
You guys don't know this.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.992
Some of you guys are just in college,
Snapchatting.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.746
Back in the day, we had to fire up
the internet like goddamn cavemen.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.289
You know what I mean?

34:08.420 --> 34:11.632
If someone picked up the phone,
"Hey, get off the phone!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.927
I'm trying to talk to somebody!"

34:14.803 --> 34:16.846
That's how we would communicate.

34:16.929 --> 34:21.101
Late at night, back and forth,
back and forth.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.145
One night she was like, "Hey, come over."

34:24.228 --> 34:26.398
I bike over to her place,

34:26.481 --> 34:29.275
white picket fence, McMansion,
Ford Expedition,

34:29.359 --> 34:31.777
Eddie Bauer edition.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.614
"Oh, they made it!"

34:34.697 --> 34:38.493
Mrs Reed opens the door. Her father
is this successful retired judge.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.288
Mrs Reed's like, "You want brownies?"
"Yeah. Cool."

34:41.371 --> 34:44.916
"Hey, stay for dinner."
"We just had brownies, but okay."

34:45.000 --> 34:47.710
We're sitting there at the dinner table.

34:47.793 --> 34:52.299
And now Mrs Reed's like, "Hey, honey,
we know so much about Bethany,

34:52.841 --> 34:55.176
but we don't know anything about you.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.220
What do you like? What are you into?"

34:57.304 --> 34:58.305
I was like, "What?"

35:00.473 --> 35:02.267
"What do I like? Um...

35:02.684 --> 35:03.684
Nobody...

35:04.519 --> 35:06.396
Nobody has ever asked me that before."

35:08.523 --> 35:10.483
"I guess I like acoustic guitar."

35:11.026 --> 35:12.527
"You should do that.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.363
You should follow your dreams."

35:19.284 --> 35:20.869
"Maybe I will.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.330
Maybe I will follow my dreams."

35:23.413 --> 35:27.334
Then Bethany's like, "Hey,
we always study at my house.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.544
Why don't we study at your house?"

35:29.628 --> 35:32.380
I was like, "I've got to go."

35:33.256 --> 35:35.467
What, invite you over to my house?

35:35.550 --> 35:38.637
You walk in: "What language
are you guys speaking?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.472
What's that smell?"

35:40.555 --> 35:44.976
I'm not going to open myself up to that.
But I was like, "No, she's different."

35:45.060 --> 35:46.770
I hit her up late at night.

35:46.853 --> 35:51.483
"Mom, Dad, a school friend is coming over.
Everyone here, please be normal."

35:51.983 --> 35:55.904
My dad is like, "We are normal."
Killing me, you know what I mean?

35:56.738 --> 35:59.991
"Hasan, we're normal.
Be proud. You should be proud."

36:00.075 --> 36:03.203
Who is proud? No one is.
You're walking around like a rooster.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.205
I'm not proud and no one is proud.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.373
We get there.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.959
We're sitting on my living room table.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.505
My mom and dad are arguing in Hindi.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.549
My mom is frying pakoras.
The fobbiest thing ever.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.220
<i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</i>
is playing on Zee TV.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.514
But it's too much.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.016
It's all coming at this girl.
It's too much.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.352
You've got to ease your way in.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.978
She's from Nebraska.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.814
Soul cycle, yoga, then Zee TV.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.108
Don't just, like, go into it.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.194
So I'm looking at her, like,
"Don't say anything.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.863
Please don't say anything."

36:40.156 --> 36:44.119
She looks up from her book,
and she's like, "You know what?

36:45.328 --> 36:47.038
This is really nice.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.376
We should do this more often.
This is really nice."

36:51.960 --> 36:54.587
And I look at her, and I'm like,
"Oh, my God.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.507
I love you, my white princess."

36:59.342 --> 37:02.595
"You see me.
I don't got to change who I am?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.973
I can be me!"

37:05.056 --> 37:08.268
So I'm going back and forth.
Her house, my house.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.855
One night, we're on the living room table.
We're doing integrals.

37:14.649 --> 37:18.319
She closes her book.
She's like, "Hey. It's late."

37:19.112 --> 37:21.239
And I'm like, "It is late."

37:22.365 --> 37:24.159
And she's like...

37:25.160 --> 37:26.453
"I should go home."

37:26.536 --> 37:29.581
I was like, "Yeah, you should..."
Why did you say that?

37:29.664 --> 37:31.541
That was your chance. Don't do that.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.210
I said, "Wait, let me walk you out."

37:34.294 --> 37:36.379
So I'm walking her out.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.757
She gets in the car.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.425
I'm about to close the door.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.803
She rams her arm into the door,
leans out and gives me a kiss.

37:43.887 --> 37:46.973
"I love you." Drives off into the night.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.434
Like a fucking G!

37:50.643 --> 37:52.562
Because she knew the rules.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.816
She knew the rules.
No fun, no friends, no girlfriends.

37:56.900 --> 38:00.195
All we had was that stolen moment
in my driveway.

38:00.820 --> 38:04.657
You guys are like, "I was getting handjobs
when I was nine."

38:04.741 --> 38:06.826
Not me. Not this guy.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.661
Not you, not you, not you.

38:08.745 --> 38:09.871
Not us.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.999
I was like, "Are we getting married?
I have to change my pants.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.834
We are definitely getting married.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.711
When is the <i>shaadi</i> ?"

38:19.589 --> 38:22.842
Now, my AP Calc class was
a group of overachievers

38:22.926 --> 38:25.053
and my Calc teacher, Mr Pendleton,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.597
wanted us to live lives outside of school.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.600
So one day he gets up
in front of the entire class.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.853
"Alright, you guys are
all killing it academically

38:33.937 --> 38:37.732
but I want you to know
there is more to life

38:38.608 --> 38:40.652
than just getting into UC Berkeley."

38:41.486 --> 38:43.988
One kid was like,
"I know, getting into Stanford."

38:44.072 --> 38:47.742
He's like, "No, you have to live
a life worth talking about,

38:47.826 --> 38:51.955
which is why I'm making it mandatory
for everyone in this class

38:52.038 --> 38:54.332
to go to prom."

38:54.415 --> 38:57.627
I'm like, "All 30 of us?
We're all going to prom?

38:57.710 --> 38:58.962
AP Calc? Us?

38:59.045 --> 39:01.840
Me, Jehovah's Witness girl,
Korean exchange students,

39:01.923 --> 39:03.299
going to the prom?

39:03.383 --> 39:04.717
Thirty for 30? All of us?"

39:04.801 --> 39:06.678
I'm laughing so hard, I'm crying.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.305
He's like, "Hanson, this is not funny."

39:09.389 --> 39:11.975
He walks over to the board,
he pulls it down.

39:12.058 --> 39:16.521
It's a bracket with everybody's name on it
leading up to the big dance.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.315
It's March Madness for nerds.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.527
I'm like, "Whatever,
it's not going to happen.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.237
He can't do this."

39:24.320 --> 39:26.656
Weeks go by.
Kids start getting dates.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.033
Three days before prom
he walks to the board.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.953
Last two names:
Hasan Minhaj, Bethany Reed.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.789
The class goes nuts. They're like, "Oh!

39:36.374 --> 39:37.792
They're going to fuck!"

39:39.002 --> 39:42.046
"No, we're not! Are we?
No, no we're not."

39:42.589 --> 39:45.216
I look at her,
"Please don't say anything."

39:45.300 --> 39:47.760
She says nothing, like a G.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.349
Bell rings. I'm walking to my locker.
I hear footsteps.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.269
She's like, "Wait up."
I was like, "What's up?"

39:58.271 --> 40:01.232
"Oh, that was crazy back there.
What are the chances?"

40:01.316 --> 40:03.484
She's like, "Listen, you know,

40:04.027 --> 40:07.196
ever since my family moved
from Nebraska,

40:08.031 --> 40:09.657
you've been my best friend.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.327
And you're really special to me.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.330
This year wouldn't be the same
without you.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.791
So I was wondering,
will you go to prom with me?"

40:27.258 --> 40:29.218
I was like, "Yes, my white princess."

40:29.302 --> 40:33.056
As soon as I said that, I was like, "No!"
I had bitten off more than I could chew.

40:33.139 --> 40:37.435
"No, wait. You've got cards to play.
You're good. You're a good kid.

40:37.518 --> 40:42.690
Also, remember, parents respect honesty.
You've seen this on TV.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.568
If you go home and are honest,

40:46.235 --> 40:47.737
your parents will be like,

40:47.820 --> 40:51.574
'Even though I disagree with you,
I respect your candor.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.826
Therefore I will grant your wish.'"

40:53.910 --> 40:57.705
I ran home, I was like,
"Dad, I would like to go to prom."

40:59.123 --> 41:02.126
Which means, "I will break your face."
"Duly noted, father."

41:02.210 --> 41:06.631
"Bethany, situation at home.
Father doesn't want us to go to prom.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.550
I'm going to sneak out.
I live on the second story.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.053
I'm going to jump off and land on my bike.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.847
I'll bike to your place,
we dance it up,

41:14.931 --> 41:16.641
and if I die, I had a great run."

41:16.724 --> 41:20.103
You know? You're going to die,
so put it on the tombstone.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.897
"Hasan Minhaj, 4.3 GPA,
kissed a white girl."

41:22.981 --> 41:24.816
What an amazing way to go.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.819
The night of prom rolls around.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.862
I put on the JC Penney suit.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.782
Spray on the Michael Jordan cologne.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.743
Six puffs, one for each championship.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.288
You don't want to overkill it
with the MJ cologne.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.832
Don't be tacky.

41:40.915 --> 41:45.712
I'm scaling down the side of my roof,
scraping my knees.

41:45.795 --> 41:48.089
I jump off the roof. It's like 20 feet.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.175
I jump off, I somehow land,
I get on my bike.

41:51.259 --> 41:55.513
It's beautiful, the sun is setting,
it's one of those gorgeous evenings.

41:55.596 --> 41:58.391
And I'm biking with my knees bowed out.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.310
So my slacks don't get
caught up in the chains.

42:02.729 --> 42:06.315
Fast enough to get there, but slow enough
to not get pit stains.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.026
I'm balancing the corsage.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.367
"Alright, go. Go.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.286
You're good. You're getting there."

42:20.246 --> 42:23.416
I get to her house. I park my bike.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.877
I'm walking up to the doorstep,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.963
and I'm about to ring the doorbell
when I'm like, "Wait.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.091
30 second time-out. Do you understand
what's about to go down?

42:32.800 --> 42:36.054
You're about to go to prom
with Bethany motherfucking Reed."

42:38.264 --> 42:40.099
"This is the American dream.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.769
This is what Dad fought for."

42:44.771 --> 42:47.732
Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.069
She has this look of concern.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.988
And I look over her shoulder,

42:54.614 --> 42:58.034
and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage
on Bethany's wrist.

43:00.328 --> 43:04.332
And she's like, "Oh, my God, honey,
did Bethany not tell you?

43:05.875 --> 43:08.503
Sweetie, we love you,
we think you're great.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.671
We love that you come over and study.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.175
But tonight is one of those nights...

43:14.842 --> 43:17.470
We have a lot of family
back home in Nebraska

43:18.346 --> 43:20.807
and we're going to be taking photos,

43:21.641 --> 43:23.893
so we don't think you'd be a good fit.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.479
Do you need a ride home?

43:26.562 --> 43:28.731
Mr Reed can give you a ride home."

43:29.565 --> 43:32.026
And I was like, "No, I have my bike."

43:33.111 --> 43:36.197
And I just biked home
and played <i>Mario Kart</i>.

43:36.906 --> 43:40.409
That's the nicest I've ever been
dressed, playing <i>Mario Kart</i>.

43:42.245 --> 43:45.748
I wish I had said, "Fuck that,
I'm going to the dance."

43:45.832 --> 43:47.250
I didn't.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.086
The sad part is,
I felt bad for being there.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.589
Who was I to ruin
their picture-perfect celebration?

43:54.215 --> 43:57.635
You've seen movies. How many times
do you see that on screen?

43:57.718 --> 44:01.097
And it's not like they were yokels
yelling "sand nigger!"

44:01.180 --> 44:02.807
I could let that pass.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.601
I'd eaten off their plates,
kissed their daughter.

44:05.685 --> 44:10.064
I didn't know that people could be bigoted
even as they were smiling at you.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.818
It's hard when you see people
saying they love you

44:13.901 --> 44:16.112
but they're afraid at the same time.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.990
And I didn't know what that meant.

44:20.241 --> 44:24.245
Then the following Monday,
during first period she finds me.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.331
She's like, "Everybody
has been asking why we didn't go.

44:27.415 --> 44:29.125
Please don't say anything.

44:29.208 --> 44:32.253
It's a generational thing.
Please don't say anything."

44:32.962 --> 44:36.424
And I look at her.
Second period rolls around like clockwork.

44:36.507 --> 44:39.468
Mr Pendleton's like,
"So, lovebirds, what happened?

44:39.552 --> 44:41.554
Everybody's wondering."

44:41.637 --> 44:45.391
So I'm, like, "Yeah, what happened?"
Looking at her.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.310
She just looks down.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.313
Now everybody's looking at me
so I've got to improvise.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.607
I was like, "Yeah, you know,

44:52.690 --> 44:54.525
I decided not to go.

44:54.609 --> 44:58.821
I mean, dances are overrated.
They're a cliché. I decided not to go."

44:58.905 --> 45:01.908
Everybody in the class looked at me.
"Wow, you dick."

45:02.533 --> 45:05.661
"You stood up the new girl?
Thank God Jeff took her.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.204
You're a dick."

45:07.872 --> 45:10.041
That's the last time we ever spoke.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.337
And you know,

45:14.420 --> 45:17.882
time has passed,
and I don't really think about that day.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.301
I mean, I did write
a show about it, but...

45:21.677 --> 45:23.095
like a lot of people...

45:27.934 --> 45:31.020
you move on
to different chapters of your life.

45:32.104 --> 45:36.233
You have selective memory.
You're in college. Tools, Clear History.

45:36.317 --> 45:39.195
Out of college.
Tools, Clear History. Never did that.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.781
Married. Tools, Clear History.
Never happened.

45:41.864 --> 45:45.034
Second marriage, Tools, Clear History.
Never happened.

45:45.117 --> 45:49.080
But for the most part, I actually think
about it the way my dad does.

45:49.163 --> 45:52.792
"Oh, you couldn't go to prom
with a white girl?

45:52.875 --> 45:54.126
Who gives a fuck?

45:54.210 --> 45:57.672
At least your spine isn't getting
shattered in a police wagon,

45:57.755 --> 46:01.133
though it's happening
to African-Americans to this day.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.970
So this is a tax you have to pay?
I'll pay it.

46:04.053 --> 46:08.224
'I can't date your daughter.'
I don't give a fuck, Uncle Sam. Take it."

46:08.808 --> 46:10.768
But then I realized, wait, hold on.

46:10.851 --> 46:15.231
Why is it every time
the collateral damage has to be death,

46:15.314 --> 46:16.816
for us to talk about this?

46:16.899 --> 46:19.485
A kid has to get shot 16 times
for us to be like,

46:19.568 --> 46:21.988
"Maybe we have a race problem."

46:22.071 --> 46:24.699
For every Trayvon Martin
or Ahmed the clock kid,

46:24.782 --> 46:27.034
there is bigotry that happens every day.

46:27.118 --> 46:31.080
Because we're too afraid of the Other.
Someone who's not in our tribe.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.207
I wish I could tell 18-year-old me,

46:33.290 --> 46:36.961
"Hey, man, don't let
this experience define you.

46:38.004 --> 46:40.172
It's good people and bad people.

46:40.256 --> 46:43.467
Irrespective of creed, class, color,
find those people.

46:43.551 --> 46:45.845
Because love is bigger than fear."

46:45.928 --> 46:47.638
I wish I could tell him that.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.474
I really believe that.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.443
I really believe love is bigger than fear.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.278
Fox News has taught me that.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.739
Fox News is incredible.

47:04.822 --> 47:08.492
I've never seen so many people
with spray tans hate people of color.

47:08.576 --> 47:11.328
It is amazing.

47:11.829 --> 47:17.460
And Fox News is in New York.
They're in New York.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.588
<i>Daily Show</i>, Fox News,
five avenues away from each other.

47:20.671 --> 47:23.382
That's it.
Professor X, Magneto, that close.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.302
Every day I walk past
their building during lunch.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.472
I'll see all the employees,
Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly,

47:29.555 --> 47:33.517
leave their building,
cross the street, walk past me,

47:33.601 --> 47:35.478
and line up for halal chicken and rice.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.730
I'm like, "Uh...

47:39.065 --> 47:41.025
Racist Randy wants that red sauce."

47:41.108 --> 47:44.945
Your brain can be racist,
but your body will just betray you.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.864
I love that so much.

47:46.947 --> 47:51.118
All morning, they're like,
"Mexicans, all lives matter, Arabs...

47:51.202 --> 47:52.661
12:01! Shwarma time!"

47:52.745 --> 47:55.247
I love that so much.

47:55.331 --> 47:59.335
And I wish I could tell
18-year-old me that, but I can't.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.505
I don't have a time machine.
I can't tell him that.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.382
You know what the shitty part is?

48:05.466 --> 48:09.804
When you first fall in love, you get
that first taste of the Heisenberg blue.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.599
It's never the same after that.

48:13.682 --> 48:17.311
People here with girlfriends are like,
"Babe, it's different with you."

48:17.394 --> 48:19.105
You're lying and that's okay.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.816
But we had those first secrets.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.736
My secret was, "I want to be a comedian."
She said, "I want to be a journalist."

48:25.820 --> 48:27.905
We promised we would
follow our dreams,

48:27.988 --> 48:30.699
no matter what people would think.

48:30.783 --> 48:33.702
So I started doing comedy.
I wasn't very good.

48:33.786 --> 48:37.081
Two years, three years, four years,
six years, seven years...

48:37.164 --> 48:40.167
I finally get a chance
to headline a comedy club.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.212
It's a big deal for me.
Gotham Comedy Club, New York City.

48:43.295 --> 48:48.217
I did what a lot of early comedians do.
I got on Facebook, I got super cocky.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.554
I was like, "Yo, Facebook!

48:51.637 --> 48:57.143
Your boy, headlining Gotham Comedy Club.
Let me know if you want some tix."

48:57.226 --> 48:59.520
All caps. Like, relax! I sent it.

48:59.603 --> 49:02.314
I was like, "I'm a headliner.
Let's go to the airport.

49:02.398 --> 49:06.735
LA, Chicago, Nashville, New York...
I'm flying Southwest.

49:06.819 --> 49:08.779
I was like, "I made it!

49:09.446 --> 49:14.326
Oh, hello. La Quinta Inn!
Don't mind if I do.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.453
Free Wi-Fi? Why not?

49:16.537 --> 49:19.081
Let's see what the internet
is saying about me.

49:19.165 --> 49:22.459
I open up my laptop,
fire up Facebook, and I see this.

49:24.295 --> 49:28.883
"Hey, um, long time no see.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.261
You're doing comedy now. So cool.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.807
Listen, me and my girlfriends
live in Manhattan

49:37.558 --> 49:40.561
and we were wondering
if we could get some tix?"

49:40.644 --> 49:41.687
Question mark.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.355
Okay.

49:49.987 --> 49:53.282
I don't know if you know what this means.

49:53.949 --> 49:57.953
But, you know, if life gives you lemons,

49:58.954 --> 50:01.665
sometimes you've got to make
"revenge lemonade."

50:02.625 --> 50:04.710
Sprinkle in a little irony.

50:04.793 --> 50:07.630
Reply, son. Reply.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.799
"Bethany, comma, enter.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.345
Totally remember you.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.306
Long time no see, indeed."

50:22.228 --> 50:24.480
"Seven years. A lot of time.

50:24.563 --> 50:28.943
Listen, I would love to give you some tix,

50:30.236 --> 50:33.113
but we're going to be taking
a lot of photos tonight...

50:37.451 --> 50:39.703
and I don't think you'd be a good fit."

50:39.787 --> 50:42.122
Send that shit! Send that shit right now!

50:42.206 --> 50:44.917
Send that shit right now!

50:45.000 --> 50:45.918
I jump on stage!

50:46.001 --> 50:50.005
I run to the club, jump on stage...
I don't even know what I said.

50:50.089 --> 50:51.966
I was like, "Fuck that. Goodnight."

50:52.049 --> 50:54.843
Boom. I go to the airport.

50:54.927 --> 50:58.555
We go from New York, Chicago,
to Nashville to LA.

50:58.639 --> 51:02.393
I pick up my Toyota Camry
L-motherfucking-E.

51:02.476 --> 51:05.604
Don't you ever forget about it.
Cloth interior for life.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.899
Whipping through the streets of LA.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.235
"Hello, headliner. What do you need?"

51:11.318 --> 51:13.529
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, Dad had a heart attack.

51:14.363 --> 51:15.364
Hey...

51:15.823 --> 51:17.491
idiot, pick up your phone.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.743
I need you. Dad had a heart attack."

51:20.494 --> 51:23.163
My dad had just suffered
a quintuple bypass.

51:23.872 --> 51:26.083
So they're rushing him to the hospital.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.876
Aisha goes, "Come home, now."

51:29.086 --> 51:31.672
I was like, "I got a set
at the Comedy Store.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.967
I'm going to do that,
then I'll come home."

51:35.926 --> 51:38.429
And I did a set at the Comedy Store.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.432
And then I drove home.

51:42.599 --> 51:44.268
And I don't know why...

51:45.519 --> 51:49.898
I get to Kaiser and run upstairs.
My mom and my sisters are crying.

51:49.982 --> 51:54.320
My sister looks at me, she's like,
"They don't know what you did. I do."

51:54.945 --> 51:57.281
Doctor sees me. "Are you his son?"
"Yeah."

51:57.364 --> 51:59.283
"You're over 18? Sign this."

51:59.366 --> 52:01.368
I sign this waiver

52:02.286 --> 52:06.123
that clears the hospital of liability
if something happens to my dad.

52:06.206 --> 52:08.083
The surgery is that risky.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.837
I'm signing this piece of paper
and looking at him,

52:12.588 --> 52:15.299
and I feel like I'm signing
a death certificate.

52:15.924 --> 52:18.886
His body temperature is so low
that he looks blue.

52:19.762 --> 52:23.515
They wheel him into surgery
and I hand the clipboard to the doctor.

52:23.599 --> 52:27.353
I look at my dad, like,
"If this is the last time I see my dad...

52:28.479 --> 52:31.315
I'm saying goodbye
to a person I barely even know."

52:33.233 --> 52:36.570
And I'm waiting, hoping
that he comes out of surgery okay.

52:37.237 --> 52:39.448
And somehow he makes it through.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.993
We're in the hospital.
I have to tell him stories.

52:43.077 --> 52:47.081
So I'm telling him stories about my life,
he's telling me stories about his.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.083
So I tell him the prom story.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.002
He goes, "Hasan, I'm mad at you."

52:52.586 --> 52:55.547
"I know, I kissed a girl.
I'll never do it again."

52:57.508 --> 52:58.801
He goes, "No...

52:59.426 --> 53:01.011
why don't you forgive Bethany?"

53:04.139 --> 53:06.934
He wanted to be the bigger person again.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.061
I was like, "Why?"

53:09.144 --> 53:12.147
"You know when I emigrated
to this country in 1982,

53:12.231 --> 53:15.526
I thought if I let you go
to a school dance,

53:15.609 --> 53:19.488
you would join a gang, get a girl pregnant
and become a drug dealer, in one night.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.031
I wanted to protect you.

53:21.115 --> 53:24.993
Her family saw stuff about us.
They wanted to protect their daughter.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.871
Everybody's afraid of everybody.
But Hasan..."

53:39.633 --> 53:41.552
"Hasan, you have to be brave.

53:42.302 --> 53:46.432
Your courage to do what's right
has to be greater than your fear.

53:46.515 --> 53:49.268
So, Hasan, be brave. Hasan, be brave."

53:50.018 --> 53:53.564
It's a very beautiful poem.
I think about it all the time.

53:53.647 --> 53:57.693
And look, there are some days
where I can forgive that person.

53:57.776 --> 54:01.071
The past is the past.
Tools, Clear History. It's done.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.739
Other days, "No, fuck that.

54:02.823 --> 54:05.284
This is <i>House of Cards</i>.
Crush our enemies."

54:05.367 --> 54:07.828
I didn't know how to feel, until this.

54:08.412 --> 54:11.540
<i>Pizza Hut new big pizza sliders are here.</i>

54:11.623 --> 54:14.209
<i>Get nine in a box for just ten bucks.</i>

54:14.293 --> 54:15.627
<i>Ten bucks.</i>

54:15.711 --> 54:17.713
<i>Match up to three ways.</i>

54:18.172 --> 54:19.965
<i>Three? Cheese!</i>

54:20.048 --> 54:23.427
<i>Big, delicious sliders,
only at your Pizza Hut.</i>

54:23.510 --> 54:25.804
<i>And that's how you make it great.</i>

54:25.888 --> 54:27.723
Alright, so...

54:27.806 --> 54:31.059
so this airs during March Madness.

54:31.143 --> 54:34.980
Everyone sees it. The night this airs,
friends send me text messages.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.273
"Hey, man,

54:36.773 --> 54:37.941
by any chance do you know

54:38.025 --> 54:41.612
how many pizza sliders you get in a box
for just ten bucks?"

54:46.950 --> 54:47.868
"Nine!"

54:47.951 --> 54:51.747
"Is it true you can mix and match
up to three ways?"

54:53.999 --> 54:55.584
"Yes, three. Yes."

54:55.667 --> 54:58.754
A buddy of mine sends me this screengrab.

55:01.590 --> 55:06.220
"Just saw my high school prom date
in a Pizza Hut ad."

55:06.303 --> 55:08.222
#throwback.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.806
#it's a small world.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.559
#brilliant.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.562
To which I reply,

55:18.190 --> 55:20.567
"We didn't end up going, though.

55:21.527 --> 55:23.070
How've you been?"

55:23.820 --> 55:25.697
#MrP.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.116
#Calc.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.911
To which she replies,

55:31.578 --> 55:36.667
"I know! Made for a better tweet though.

55:36.750 --> 55:39.294
Let me know when you're in New York."

55:39.795 --> 55:41.672
To which I reply,

55:41.755 --> 55:43.757
"abso-fucking-lutely."

55:43.840 --> 55:47.636
Now, against the advice of my therapist
I go on Facebook,

55:47.719 --> 55:49.805
because she has a public profile.

55:49.888 --> 55:53.433
So I start clicking around.
"Bethany Reed." Okay.

55:53.517 --> 55:56.228
"Lives in Manhattan." Duh, we knew that.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.147
"In a relationship with..." I click it.

56:15.706 --> 56:17.541
"Rajesh...

56:17.624 --> 56:20.168
Rengatramanajanana..."

56:20.252 --> 56:22.754
She is dating an Indian dude,

56:22.838 --> 56:24.965
and this dude is Indian as fuck.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.842
Look at his name!

56:26.925 --> 56:29.386
Look at how big his name is.

56:29.469 --> 56:33.348
It's so big, it barely fits
in his Facebook profile.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.809
So big. Ten syllables.

56:35.892 --> 56:40.981
Ra-jesh Ren-gat-ra-ma-na-ja-na-nam.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.234
Are you kidding me?
How many letters are in the alphabet?

56:44.318 --> 56:48.405
How many letters in the alphabet?
26 letters in the alphabet, right?

56:48.488 --> 56:51.283
How many letters are in
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam? 25.

56:51.366 --> 56:54.494
That's one less letter
than the entire alphabet.

56:54.578 --> 56:57.789
Come on! How easy is my name?
Hasan Minhaj. So easy.

56:57.873 --> 57:00.000
She was like, "Fuck that.

57:00.709 --> 57:03.170
Give me the Rajesh Rengatramana...

57:03.253 --> 57:05.005
motherfucking-jananam."

57:05.088 --> 57:08.508
Like, "No!" God is laughing at me.
God is laughing at me.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.553
Now, against the advice of my therapist...

57:12.638 --> 57:13.889
I make contact.

57:13.972 --> 57:17.559
She's like, "Do not make contact."
I'm like, "Tell me what I want to hear."

57:17.643 --> 57:20.020
"Need closure? Go for it."
"See you next week."

57:20.103 --> 57:21.188
Therapy is bullshit.

57:21.855 --> 57:25.734
"Bethany, I've got a gig in New York
next week. I would love to meet up."

57:25.817 --> 57:28.278
She's like, "Yeah, let's meet up."

57:28.362 --> 57:32.491
And I go from LA to New York,
direct flight. Pizza Hut money.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.535
I'm walking through New York. I'm livid.

57:35.619 --> 57:36.662
I'm pissed.

57:36.745 --> 57:38.664
How is this possible?

57:38.747 --> 57:41.416
How is this possible?
Rajesh Rengatramana...

57:41.875 --> 57:43.210
How does she make love?

57:43.293 --> 57:45.545
"Oh, my God,
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam,

57:45.629 --> 57:47.214
give it to me right now.

57:47.297 --> 57:50.425
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam,
I want you so bad.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.803
Put your Rajesh
in my Rengatramanajananam."

57:52.886 --> 57:54.262
I was like, "Stop it.

57:55.180 --> 57:59.059
Stop imagining her having sex
with Rajesh Rengatramanajananam.

58:00.519 --> 58:02.020
You've got leverage.

58:02.104 --> 58:05.565
Walk in there, be cool.
Walk in there, be confident.

58:05.649 --> 58:08.819
Be like this, dude.
Walk in there and just own it.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.238
Be like this, be like this."

58:18.537 --> 58:19.621
"What's up?"

58:19.705 --> 58:23.375
Do that with this, and then lick the lips
and go, "What's up?"

58:23.458 --> 58:25.085
I'm practicing it.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.046
I get to the door, open the door,

58:28.130 --> 58:29.965
then I hear, "Hey, Hasan!"

58:30.549 --> 58:32.175
She's sitting outside.

58:33.385 --> 58:35.929
She saw me doing this shit
in the street.

58:41.768 --> 58:44.104
I was like, "Oh, hey, what's up?

58:45.188 --> 58:47.482
Is someone sitting there? Cool."

58:47.566 --> 58:50.485
I just walk up and I'm like,
"Alright, yeah.

58:50.569 --> 58:52.738
I'll just sit here, cool."

58:53.488 --> 58:54.906
I'm sitting there.

58:54.990 --> 58:57.325
When you see
someone from your past,

58:57.409 --> 58:59.953
all of a sudden, you're that age again.

59:00.537 --> 59:04.541
So all that Kanye juice
just goes out of my body.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.502
I can't say anything.

59:07.586 --> 59:09.713
It's like the adults in <i>Charlie Brown.</i>

59:09.796 --> 59:13.008
I can't say anything.
20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

59:13.091 --> 59:16.053
"Dude, are you going to be
a <i>darapok </i> again?

59:16.136 --> 59:17.721
Say something."

59:18.430 --> 59:21.475
She starts talking about rent control
and I cut her off.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.435
"Bethany, do you know why I'm here?

59:24.603 --> 59:26.646
I'm here to talk about prom."

59:29.691 --> 59:32.611
And her face went white.

59:33.904 --> 59:37.074
You guys knew she was white?
It went whiter than white.

59:37.741 --> 59:40.243
And I was like, "You knew my situation.
You knew it.

59:40.327 --> 59:42.954
I was ride or die for you.
At that age, that's a lot.

59:43.038 --> 59:46.083
You weren't the same for me, fine.
Whatever.

59:46.166 --> 59:48.168
But what makes matters worse is,

59:48.251 --> 59:50.253
you had me socially crucified.

59:50.337 --> 59:52.005
You knew how hard it was for me,

59:52.089 --> 59:56.718
and then I was so insecure at that age
that I couldn't date another white person,

59:56.802 --> 01:00:00.097
because I was afraid of not being able
to be with them,

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.724
because of the color of my skin.

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.601
Do you know what that's like?

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.853
And now, I'm trying to pursue my dreams,

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.438
I'm trying,

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.900
but now you're writing about me,
you act like we're cool,

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.860
when we're not.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.238
Why do you do that?"

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:21.034
And she was like, "I am so sorry.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.080
But you know we were 18, right?

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.583
Like, I really wanted to go with you.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.836
But my mom, she's very controlling.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:35.048
Do you know what it's like to have
a parent that controls your life?"

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:40.345
"No, I don't. What is that like? Do tell.
I would love to hear that story."

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:42.681
"Tell me more."

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.643
What?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:49.104
She's like, "I wish I could
have gone with you.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.231
But I can't change the past.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:55.777
I never thought you would want
to talk to me ever again.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.280
But the reason why I write about you

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:00.991
is because I see you kept your promise.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.911
So even if you never want
to talk to me ever again,

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.664
I'll always be rooting for you."

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:12.919
You know how you carry hatred
in your heart about people in your past?

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.172
"They did this to me. Fuck them."

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.590
Damn them.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:22.012
In that moment, I let it go.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.890
I crushed it like a Voldemort Horcrux.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:37.110
But I had to ask her the question
that we're all thinking.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.909
"What about Mr Rengatramanajananam?"

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.954
She's like, "I hit it off with this guy.
We decide to move in together.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.874
I needed money for a deposit
so I called my mom."

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.417
"What did your mom say?"

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.630
"My mom was like, 'No.
You know the way our family is.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.465
So make up your mind.'"

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.343
And I was like, "What did you say?"

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.929
And she's like,
"I told my mom, 'Not again.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:07.974
This isn't high school.
Raj is a good person and so am I.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.727
So I'm going to be with him
because it's right.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.021
I hope you make up your mind.'"

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.483
And I'm looking at her,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.069
and I'm so embarrassed.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.156
I'm like, "Dude, what are you doing?

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:28.662
Why are you hunting down people
from your past like a psycho?

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.041
You're not Liam Neeson.
What is going on?"

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.212
I realized, "You don't give a shit
about this person."

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.005
I care about what she represents.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.217
Growing up, we just want that co-sign.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.219
To tell them you're good enough.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:48.431
"Sit here. You're good enough."
But that's not the American dream.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:52.811
It's not asking for a co-sign.
It's what every generation did before you.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.980
You claim that shit on your own terms.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.816
Pizza Hut pizza sliders.
Nine in a box for just ten bucks.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.109
That's you.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:03.238
You're not Hasan Minhaj.
You're "Hussan Minhajj".

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:07.409
This is new brown America. The dream
is for you to take, so take that shit.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.244
Stop blaming other people.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:19.671
Now I'm standing outside the restaurant
and I can't even concentrate,

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:22.048
because I know she's
more evolved than me.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.968
She's like, "Next time,
me, you and Raj should hang out."

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:29.306
I'm like, "Yeah, let's not do that."
And I'm walking to the subway station.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.434
But I take one last look
at the restaurant.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.728
Just to see her one last time.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.231
To know that generational change
is possible with one choice.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.567
I turn around and I look,

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.445
but she's gone.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.114
And I never saw her again.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.785
I did keep my promise, though.
You know, I kept doing comedy.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:52.370
I never knew...

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:56.082
I never knew if I would do
anything more than Pizza Hut.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.293
You know how you hit that point

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.171
when your parents give up on you
and move on?

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.797
"Let's move on to Aisha."

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.176
One day I get an email
from my manager.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:10.722
"Want to audition for <i>The Daily Show</i> ?"
That's not a question. That's a statement.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:12.724
"Hey, audition for <i>The Daily Show.</i>"

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.185
I submit a tape. I get a call.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.188
"Jon Stewart saw your tape.
Come to New York.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.898
They want you to audition.

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:22.609
But, but...

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.654
you have to write another original piece.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.323
Can you write another?"

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:31.743
"No, I can't. I'm not Larry David.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.829
I can't do <i>Seinfeld </i> and <i>Curb.</i>
I'm a mere mortal."

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.415
I'm walking back and forth
in my apartment,

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:39.709
like, "I'm going to die here."

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:43.171
And it's amazing
how racism will always happen to you

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.964
when you need it the most.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.761
Like changing the oil on your car.
"Oh, 15,000 miles. Racism."

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.514
So I'm watching <i>Real Time With Bill Maher.</i>

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:55.558
Have you guys seen
<i>Real Time With Bill Maher</i> ?

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.310
You know Bill's demeanor.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:00.647
"Hey, do you believe in God?
You're a fucking idiot."

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.484
And everyone's like,
"Oh, the atheist prophet speaks!"

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.821
So this clip went viral,
him and Ben Affleck.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.908
Bill Maher is like, "These Muslims,
85 percent of them hate our freedom.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.453
We've got to round them up,
we've got to contain them."

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:19.290
And Ben Affleck's like, "Are you crazy?
Round them up, contain them?

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:23.586
Dude, we did that to the Japanese.
You can't do that. Am I crazy?"

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.839
And I was like, "No, you're not crazy.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.299
You're my white prince."

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:33.430
Don't you realize
what happened in that moment?

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:36.850
We got our first A-list celebrity
to back the Muslim community.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.518
We got Batman, baby!

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.730
"He may not be the hero we want, but he is
the hero the Muslim world needs."

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.357
"Batman versus Bill Maher."

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.652
I write the piece, go to New York.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.362
You get it, right?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:52.365
The producer answers the door:
"Audition with me.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.951
When you're ready, Jon will come down.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.161
Run it with me."

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.246
We're walking down the hallway,

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:03.084
and I see all these photos of the old
correspondents that came before me.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:06.421
Steve Carell, John Oliver,

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.756
Sam Bee, Jason Jones,

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.759
Ed Helms, Steven Colbert...

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.303
and me?

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:16.139
<i>Keema roti</i>, me?

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:20.310
You know we don't end up this far.
You know the way it is.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.520
Middle management till we die.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.772
We're not on that stage, ever.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.568
I walk in and I see that <i>Daily Show </i> globe.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.778
I can't tell you how blue it is.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.740
And now I'm sweating through my suit.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:37.035
The producer is like,
"We'll run it a few times."

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.704
And I sit down and I get to the desk.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:42.081
Sitting presidents
have sat on that desk.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:45.627
I sit down and we're running it,
and I'm nervous.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.214
He goes, "Hey, man,
just slow down. Alright?"

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:52.342
We run it a second time.
Now I'm stuttering.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.970
And he goes,
"Hey, man, relax. You're funny."

01:06:56.596 --> 01:07:00.683
Which is a tell-tale sign of being, like,
"Hey, man. You're not funny.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.186
You shouldn't relax."

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:06.356
And I can feel it. I'm choking.
We've all been there.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:10.109
Everyone's, "How did it go?"
You're like, "Positive thoughts."

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:13.863
No, it's not happening. You're not.
You are choking.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.991
MCAT, DAT, you're going to the Caribbean,
it's a wrap.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:20.912
You choked, right? Too real? It's real.
We've all been there.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:24.165
And I can feel this turtle head
coming out of my butt.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:27.502
I'm really nervous. I'm pooping my pants.
I'm like, "No!"

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:28.962
Then I hear...

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.759
I know that voice.
It's Jewish Yoda. It's Jon.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:40.223
He's walking through the tunnel
where the guests come,

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.558
so he's just back-lit.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:45.979
So I just see a giant shadow
walking towards me,

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.023
and I hear his accomplishments
at each step.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:52.402
"Boom! I am Jon Stewart.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.990
Boom! Twenty-two-time
Emmy-award-winning Jon Stewart.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:02.579
Boom! I redefined political satire
and comedy. What have you done?"

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.123
I'm like, "Have you heard of Pizza Hut?"

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:15.925
Then he steps into the light,

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.053
and he's shorter than I thought.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:21.471
And he has all this scruff on his face.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.143
And I look at him, and I'm like...

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:27.562
"Dad?"

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.773
He had Jewish Najmi vibes.
He shakes my hand.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.943
I could feel it,
like he'd slapped me in a previous life.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.528
I was like, "I know this hand!"

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.363
He starts riffing, I start riffing.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.451
The prompter guy: "What are you doing?"
"I got this."

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.911
I had it all memorized.
One shot, <i>Eight Mile</i>.

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.997
And I stuck my landing
like a Russian gymnast.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.207
"Thank you for the opportunity."

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.754
I tucked that turtle head
back in my butt. "We're going home."

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.548
I walk out the door,
but then I hear a voice.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.925
"Hey, man, where are you going?"

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.636
And it's Jon.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.180
I was like, "Oh, I live in LA.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.352
I've got to go back to LA."

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.979
"Well, I'll see you Monday, right?"

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.732
I was like, "Why?"

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:16.109
"Well, you work here.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.946
So I'll see you Monday, right?"

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:24.952
I couldn't believe it. I was like,
"Oscar speech, go.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.662
Say what you got to say."

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.247
What I wanted to say was,

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:32.542
"Jon, this is one of the only things
that I've gotten

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.796
in my entire career

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.756
that my dad actually knows."

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.635
"So thank you."

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.304
But what I said was,

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.055
"Jon!

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.350
My dad...

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.353
knows you!"

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.030
He's like, "Yeah, I'm sure he does."

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:05.618
I pinch myself. "You're Hasan Minhaj.
You're going to be on <i>The Daily Show</i>."

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:09.664
I run outside.
I call my girl. She's crying.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.499
I call my mom, she's crying.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.626
I call my dad, he says "Good job."

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:18.881
"What? 'Good job'? Say it again.
I can't hear you, Dad. Say it."

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:22.927
A car almost hits me.
I'm, like, "No! I can't die.

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.346
I've got to drop
the greatest status update."

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.266
I run upstairs, open my laptop,
fire up Facebook,

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.475
and then I see this.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:45.116
You guys see this, right?

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.454
Don't you know what this means?

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.498
Don't you get it?

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.544
I'm the cure for racism.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.715
I cured it.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:05.428
Alright, maybe I didn't cure it,
but everyone has a purpose.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:08.347
Some people were put here
to find a cure for cancer,

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.932
or find a vaccine for Ebola.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:14.353
My life is definitive proof
that once you go brown,

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.272
you've got to lock that shit down.

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:31.204
Thank you. Thank you.

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:35.082
Good night. Be well.
God bless. I love you guys.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.835
I love you guys. Good night. I love you.
