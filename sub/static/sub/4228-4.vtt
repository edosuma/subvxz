They're throwing everything
they can think of at us,

00:35.745 --> 00:37.496
but we're holding our own.

00:38.319 --> 00:39.599
What the hell is she doing here?

00:39.623 --> 00:40.541
I asked for her.

00:40.583 --> 00:41.625
The least you could do is cut me
loose,

00:41.709 --> 00:42.949
let a soldier fend for herself.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.545
What would be
the point of that, Lieutenant?

00:44.587 --> 00:45.629
I'd just as soon not end up in a

00:45.671 --> 00:46.672
pile of rubble
with the rest of you.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.875
Wouldn't be so sure that's
going to happen, Lieutenant.

- Yeah.

eight Mechs,
and who knows how many Beamers?

06:08.577 --> 06:09.661
Seventeen actually.

than that, soldier.

what you have here.

08:07.172 --> 08:09.132
Lourdes: You're harnesses
were removed externally,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.658
which left
the internal nucleus intact.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.619
Now, we think
these stringy fibers here

08:13.660 --> 08:14.661
extending out to your spikes

08:14.745 --> 08:18.123
are constantly being regenerated
by the nucleus,

08:18.207 --> 08:20.000
and the Volm de-harnessing
machine allows us

08:20.125 --> 08:22.628
to extract the fibers,
and uproot the nucleus

08:22.669 --> 08:23.670
without affecting

08:23.712 --> 08:26.507
the spinal cord
or the nervous system.

Ben: It's like pulling a radish
out of the ground.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.595
Yeah, if you want to
think of it like that.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.515
So, um, I'll need
my inhaler again?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.642
Yes.
Unfortunately, yeah.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.185
I'll need my glasses?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.748
Lourdes: If you wore them before,
yes.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.605
Guys, I know this is scary,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.690
but you need to
understand something.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.693
Your spikes give you
amazing strength and agility,

08:46.735 --> 08:47.653
but we don't know yet

08:47.694 --> 08:50.447
what the long-term implications
are of living with them.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.574
We know it puts stress
on your skeletal muscles,

08:52.616 --> 08:55.202
and we suspect that it
interrupts stem-cell production,

08:55.285 --> 08:58.539
which, if true,
could shorten your life-span.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.666
How significantly,
we don't know.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.560
Well, it's not like
normal life-span's that

09:02.584 --> 09:03.961
long these days anyway.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.754
If you're not ready for this...

09:06.380 --> 09:07.589
Come on, Ben.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.550
It's going to be so much better.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.177
Won't it?

09:12.636 --> 09:13.845
I... I think so.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.603
Come on.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.233
Yeah. Yeah.
You know, I'm... I'm in.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.569
Okay.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.656
Let me get this straight.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.576
The so-called government
of Charleston, S.C.,

09:35.659 --> 09:37.828
is commandeering
my personal property

09:38.161 --> 09:40.581
for unknown reasons
for an unknown length of time.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.498
Is that it?

09:41.582 --> 09:42.583
Pretty much, yes.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.711
Well, that has
the sickening ring of tyranny,

09:45.752 --> 09:46.628
don't you think?

09:46.670 --> 09:48.672
A good citizen would
have gladly told

09:48.714 --> 09:51.592
his government representatives
that he had an aircraft,

09:51.633 --> 09:53.552
and then willingly
made it available.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.679
That airplane is
my ticket out of here

09:55.721 --> 09:58.599
when everything goes to hell,
as it most certainly will.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.559
You don't even know
how to fly the plane, Pope.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.520
- I'm reading a book.
- Bressler: I'm twin-engine rated,

10:03.562 --> 10:05.647
so I'll pilot
your precious aircraft,

10:05.689 --> 10:07.482
and make sure
nothing happens to it.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.734
Your damn right
because I'm going with.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.068
The hell you are.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.570
This is a classified mission.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.531
And that is
a vintage 1935 Beechcraft.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.573
Finders keepers.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.577
Listen, gentlemen,
either I am on that plane,

10:18.702 --> 10:20.495
or there will be no plane.

10:20.521 --> 10:21.681
You want to come along, Pope?

10:21.705 --> 10:22.705
Be my guest.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.082
We leave in two hours.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.876
Gentlemen.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.589
Well, you and Marina have
got the reins while I'm gone.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.550
I'll call in as soon as I know
everything's okay.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.553
We'll have somebody
on frequency full time.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.514
And now I got to ask
the hard question.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.519
Are we sure that this is a good
idea, you going there now?

10:44.561 --> 10:45.682
It's a personal request from

10:45.687 --> 10:47.606
the President of
the United States.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.649
It's kind of a
hard thing to ignore.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.608
That's just it.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.610
We just got finished
fighting off the fish heads.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.529
We're building
the supposed Volm weapon.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.282

going to this summit meeting

10:57.324 --> 10:59.618

going to help us here now?

to the people of Charleston

11:01.703 --> 11:04.456
to find out President Hathaway
is still alive.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.668

11:08.585 --> 11:09.628

but I get you.

your paperwork

11:15.717 --> 11:17.219

you're still here,

11:21.473 --> 11:23.684
It looks like somebody
already got the word.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.483
This is supposed to be
a secret mission.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.444
You should know by now
you can't keep secrets from me.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.572
Seriously, are we okay?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.616
Seriously, yes.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.785
We do need to talk
when you get back.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.161
Okay.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.705
I'll come back soon.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.458

11:50.585 --> 11:51.585
Nothing.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.505
Oh, here.

about a bubblehead,

12:37.215 --> 12:38.633

worse and worse.

this aircraft is...

12:55.525 --> 12:56.525
Safe?

12:56.651 --> 12:59.070
I was going to say,
"Capable of flight."

12:59.279 --> 13:01.615
I believe General Bressler
wouldn't let us take off

13:01.656 --> 13:04.534
if he wasn't confident
in its airworthiness.

a good party trick.

No more buzzing
inside our heads.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.483
No more staying up for days.

No more Skitter-vision.

No more translating for them
at all. No more connection.

halcyon time when
no one bothered me down here.

Now it's like

15:00.567 --> 15:02.110
You may have heard
the Volm built a device

15:02.149 --> 15:03.629
that allows us
to remove the harnesses

15:03.653 --> 15:05.653
from the children who were
enslaved by the Espheni?

15:06.615 --> 15:07.657
And it works?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.200
After you remove the harnesses,

15:09.284 --> 15:10.660
they're able to return to
normalcy with

15:10.702 --> 15:11.702
no residual effects?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.580
Well, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

15:13.599 --> 15:14.599
We'd like to know

15:14.623 --> 15:16.625
if the harnesses cause
any chromosomal mutations.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.002
DNA tests should be able to
give you an answer to that.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.545
If we had the equipment
to run one.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.631
And you're here to see if I can
devise such a test for you.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.673
Could you?

15:24.633 --> 15:25.793
If you get me these supplies,

15:26.176 --> 15:28.595
and the tissue samples,
I'll run the tests.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.514

in what your Volm ally
has to offer.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.333
And Lieutenant Fisher was
certainly impressed

22:13.458 --> 22:15.710
with the way their weapons
helped you crush that attack.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.338
- But you're not convinced?
- No, I'm not convinced.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.841
Give me a reason
to believe you, Professor?

22:22.300 --> 22:24.594
This isn't some
academic exercise here.

22:25.219 --> 22:28.598
The survival of the entire
human race is at stake.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.433
Tom: I'm well aware of that,
sir.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.394
And believe me, any vestiges
of my former, academic naivete'

22:33.478 --> 22:35.563
have been wiped away
by the last two years.

22:35.605 --> 22:36.689
My reasons for
trusting the Volm are

22:36.731 --> 22:38.691
simple but practical...
we need them.

22:38.693 --> 22:39.733
For the last seven months,

22:39.734 --> 22:42.528
we've fought side-by-side
with Cochise and his soldiers,

22:42.570 --> 22:43.654
and we've expanded
our perimeter.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.656
We've defended it
against repeated attacks.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.575
But moreover, sir...

22:47.742 --> 22:49.452
We've caused real hurt.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.579
These are real,
tangible results.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.499
I trust our ally
because in my gut,

22:54.540 --> 22:55.625
I believe that
with their knowledge

22:55.648 --> 22:57.728
of the enemy and their weaponry,
we can win this war.

22:57.752 --> 22:58.669
Donovan: Then what?

22:58.711 --> 23:02.090
What plans do the Volm have
for us after the war?

23:02.131 --> 23:03.257
They have no plan for us.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.593
And you expect us
to take your word on that?

23:05.635 --> 23:06.511
Tom: No.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.222
His.
That's why I brought him.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.773
I'm sorry about all this.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.776
It is to be expected.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.612
Professor Mason has told me a...

23:25.196 --> 23:26.614
good deal about you...

23:26.697 --> 23:28.908
how the Volm have

23:29.033 --> 23:33.538
fought the Espheni... halfway
across the universe

23:33.663 --> 23:36.541
liberating
one planet after another.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.292
And you have questions.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.710
Just one actually.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.547
What are you fighting them for?

23:42.588 --> 23:44.549
Resources, territory?

23:44.632 --> 23:49.512
A flower...
the Catarius.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.682
It blooms on my homeland
when the weather begins to warm.

23:52.723 --> 23:57.645
A flower that is...
so valuable

23:57.687 --> 23:59.897
that it's caused
an intergalactic war?

24:00.148 --> 24:03.526
The Catarius has no value
to anyone except me.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.612
Something you remember
from your childhood?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.615
Actually, I have never seen it.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.869
Just as I have never held

24:12.994 --> 24:16.539
the warm soil of my homeland
in my hands.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.750
Like the rest of my comrades,
I was born on the ships

24:19.876 --> 24:22.837
that set out from our world
hundreds of years ago.

24:23.713 --> 24:27.550
All I know of the Catarius
is an image in a data file,

24:28.634 --> 24:30.511
and through a poem
my brother read to me

24:30.595 --> 24:31.679
when I was young.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.182
You never told me
that you had a brother.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.266
He...

24:37.226 --> 24:38.519
He is deceased.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.688
On a planet orbiting

24:40.813 --> 24:42.690
one of those spots of light
up there...

24:44.358 --> 24:46.694
a most weary,
un-bright cinder

24:46.819 --> 24:49.780
far from the home
I have never known.

24:51.616 --> 24:55.453
He was born to war,
grew up in it,

24:55.536 --> 24:57.455
and it eventually claimed him.

24:58.289 --> 25:01.250
He died for a world
he never saw.

25:01.895 --> 25:02.895
Be thankful

25:02.919 --> 25:05.963
that you fight on the soil
of your homeland, gentlemen.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.798
That is a gift.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.593
I will never see my home.

25:11.552 --> 25:14.430
But if we win this war,

25:14.680 --> 25:16.891
my children's children
may one day...

25:18.226 --> 25:20.394
gaze upon a real Catarius.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.525
That is what I am fighting for,
Mr. President.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.368
Congratulations, Professor.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.537
I think you just made it
to round two.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.629
Ben: The thing is...
with my spikes,

25:46.671 --> 25:49.632
I can do things, you know,
good things.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.467
I look at...

25:52.426 --> 25:54.595
other kids in mess hall,
in school or whatever, and...

25:55.680 --> 25:57.598
I can do stuff they can't,
you know? We're...

25:58.724 --> 26:00.601
We're part of
the solution to this whole mess

26:00.643 --> 26:01.519
because of our spikes.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.980
And... yeah,
maybe that means we're freaks,

26:04.063 --> 26:06.274
but it's worth something.
It's worth the sacrifice.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.733
Isn't it?

26:09.610 --> 26:12.572
Even if it means
you only live to be 20?

26:17.702 --> 26:21.747
You know... It's okay
if you still want to do it.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.499
I know.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.506
I'll like you with glasses.

26:33.593 --> 26:34.677
Liar.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.447
- Hi, Colonel.
- Hal.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.616
Hey, is it true
my dad left Charleston?

26:58.659 --> 26:59.702
Where did he go?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.540
Can you at least tell me
when he's coming back?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.793
A couple of days...
probably.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.504
Something wrong, Hal?

27:12.590 --> 27:13.590
Can I help?

27:16.594 --> 27:17.845
Ah, it's fine.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.514
It's fine. Um...

27:20.640 --> 27:23.000
I'm just going to wait till my dad
gets back. It's all good.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.671
Now, we both know

27:51.712 --> 27:53.714
why you didn't tell Weaver
the truth, don't we?

27:54.674 --> 27:56.509
And why you let Maggie
talk you out of

27:56.550 --> 27:58.469
spilling your guts
to your father.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.513
I'm going to tell my dad
everything.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.640
Mm, nope, I don't think so.

28:02.682 --> 28:06.519
In fact, I'm willing to bet
you never tell him.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.608

And this is a hallucination.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.702
Oh, so,
we're back to that excuse?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.370
It's the truth.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.206
Then what about
all the rendezvous with Karen?

28:29.542 --> 28:30.626
They're dreams.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.461
Dreams?

28:32.670 --> 28:34.547
Oh.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.298
Come on.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.426
You know those weren't dreams.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.805
So, you go to the woods
to meet Karen...

28:43.681 --> 28:45.516
Because you love her.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.560
Because you want her.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.604
And you just can't
stop thinking about her.

28:50.688 --> 28:51.564
No.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.983
And that's why you're going to
go right on lying to Maggie,

28:54.358 --> 28:56.944
and your father
and your brothers.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.573
And it'll be easy.

29:02.116 --> 29:04.452
They want to believe your lies.

how about I take over

don't tell him anything?

- Yeah.

him worry about something else.

35:19.952 --> 35:23.580
I, um...
I came to give you these,

35:23.622 --> 35:26.500
but... I guess
you Won't be needing them.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.460
I guess not.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.468
Oh, yeah.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.344
Hey.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.804
Hey.
Where have you been?

35:38.887 --> 35:39.680
Is it late?

35:39.763 --> 35:41.640
I had a couple house calls,
and I went for a walk.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.183
I must have lost track of time.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.477
Yeah, no, I was just worried.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.563
How was your day?

35:47.688 --> 35:48.856
Mm, it was tough.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.650
I had several extractions
of spiked kids today,

35:51.692 --> 35:53.652
and I'm still a little shaky
on the Volm machine,

35:53.694 --> 35:55.487
so it took longer
than it should.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.114
I'm sure
you'll get the hang of it.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.534
Well, sure, just...
well, maybe you could

36:00.617 --> 36:02.744
go over a few things with me,
you know?

36:02.828 --> 36:05.664
- Of course. Anytime.
- (LIQUID POURING)

36:06.582 --> 36:09.459
Hey, do you want to help me
finish this off?

36:09.626 --> 36:11.962
I've had it for so long.
I'm afraid it's going to go bad.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.589
Sure. Yeah.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.553
- (BABY COOING)
- (ANNE CLEARS THROAT)

36:20.304 --> 36:22.806
To... good friends.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.391
Good friends.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.854
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry I've been

36:28.979 --> 36:32.482
such a handful
these last couple of weeks.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.736
It's just... everything
with the baby has been

36:36.236 --> 36:37.529
really overwhelming.

36:37.571 --> 36:38.780
Yeah, of course it's been.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.494
I'm sorry.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.622
It's, urn...

36:47.539 --> 36:48.665
It's okay.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.463
Oh, God.

37:00.469 --> 37:01.678
We got to go, Lexie.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.649
You see those three stars
right there?

37:14.191 --> 37:16.485
That's called
the summer triangle.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.738
That's Vega, Deneb, and Altair.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.533
See the kind of faded one
in the center of the triangle?

37:23.951 --> 37:24.952
Wait a minute.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.456
Oh. There it is.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.960
It's Albireo.
It's a binary star system.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.670
You see how one of them's
kind of orange

37:34.711 --> 37:35.796
and the other one's blue?

37:35.921 --> 37:38.590
- The blue one's hotter.
- Exactly.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.011
I wonder
which one they came from.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.767
Well, it doesn't matter.
They're here now.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.690
Hathaway: I'll get you home, Tom.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.567
I don't know when,
but I will get you home.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.404
I understand the sacrifice
I'm asking you to make.

38:01.048 --> 38:02.048
To be honest,

38:02.072 --> 38:04.700
it's not one I'm even sure
I could make myself.

38:05.659 --> 38:10.497
We have a chance... now...
to make the world work again,

38:10.539 --> 38:11.748
and we have to do it.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.500
If we survive.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.014
And I believe
that the Volm are offering us

38:16.086 --> 38:18.547
our only viable option
to retake the planet.

38:18.672 --> 38:19.672
So, they have a strategy?

38:19.673 --> 38:20.674
They've got a working strategy,

38:20.716 --> 38:22.509
and they've got the weaponry
to back it up.

38:22.551 --> 38:23.844
Can you be more specific?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.384
I'd prefer that Cochise
filled you in on the details.

38:27.389 --> 38:30.642
But suffice to say,
if we're successful,

38:30.767 --> 38:33.645
we could take down
the entire Espheni war machine.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.651
Sir.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.321
Advance scouts just reported

38:42.404 --> 38:45.240
enemy aircraft inbound
headed straight for us.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.700
I don't understand.
How did they find us?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.493
An excellent question, sir,
but we have to

38:48.577 --> 38:50.119
- get you out of here now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.705
If not you, then who?!

38:51.788 --> 38:53.832
We don't have time
for this now. Come on.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.543
Come, Professor. Come.

38:57.438 --> 38:58.438
Here are the coordinates,

38:58.462 --> 39:00.839
but follow in close formation
just in case.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.507
Roger that.

39:02.966 --> 39:03.967
No, no, no!

39:04.217 --> 39:05.385
Cochise is coming with us!

39:05.510 --> 39:08.680
There's no time to argue this!
Get in your plane now!

39:12.559 --> 39:14.102
We have to go now, Professor!

39:14.269 --> 39:16.605
No matter what,
we have to go now!

39:20.525 --> 39:21.610
Come on!

39:33.705 --> 39:35.374
(PANTING)

39:41.505 --> 39:44.466
- Aah!
- Hello Doctor Glass.

39:46.927 --> 39:48.845
Hello, Alexis.

39:55.102 --> 39:56.103
No.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.563
No.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.524
You can't have her.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.442
No. (PANTING)

40:02.901 --> 40:04.653
It's okay, Anne.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.489
Everything's going to be fine.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.421
Tom: General!

40:22.546 --> 40:23.630
Damn.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.298
Hang on!

40:36.226 --> 40:37.519
No!

40:37.644 --> 40:39.228
We got to land!
We got to make sure!

40:39.229 --> 40:40.522
Impossible, Professor.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.566
We got a Beamer
right on our tail!

40:43.567 --> 40:45.610
There's no way
we're going to outrun that thing.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.112
We got to get this plane down
now!

40:47.195 --> 40:49.656
Strap yourself in,
you damn fool!

40:51.366 --> 40:52.951
(SHOUTS)

40:59.541 --> 41:00.625
Professor!

41:01.918 --> 41:03.587
Tom: Fireball
coming right toward us!

41:03.628 --> 41:05.589
Hang on!

41:06.214 --> 41:08.216
(EXPLOSION)

41:11.636 --> 41:13.096
(ALARM BLARING)

41:22.689 --> 41:25.650
Looks like
we're walking from here!

42:04.898 --> 42:07.400
(English US - SDH)
