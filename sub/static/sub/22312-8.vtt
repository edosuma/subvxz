Sun down...

00:21.020 --> 00:23.314
Monsters up!

00:31.656 --> 00:32.907
Whoa!

00:36.745 --> 00:38.329
Oh, no!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.708
Uh...

00:41.791 --> 00:43.376
But I...

00:43.460 --> 00:46.212
Oh, dear. Maybe it'll be okay.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.131
Let's let it dry for a bit.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.091
Uh, oh...

00:50.175 --> 00:53.136
Come paint with us,
Frankie. It'll cheer you up.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.932
Oh!

01:01.436 --> 01:03.521
Oops. Sorry.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.691
Don't you worry. We'll
get this all cleaned up.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.693
Oh! But first...

01:08.777 --> 01:10.779
you know what time it is!

01:10.862 --> 01:12.280

Cleo!

01:37.096 --> 01:39.098
Super Monsters!

01:41.100 --> 01:44.979
Tonight we're all going
on a field trip to the museum!

01:46.773 --> 01:49.567
As a monster, it's
important to learn about

01:49.651 --> 01:52.195
all the different creatures
that live in our world.

01:52.278 --> 01:56.157
But before we go, let's
get everything cleaned up!

01:57.367 --> 01:58.701
Okay, okay! One...

02:01.204 --> 02:02.330
I'll clean up the paints!

02:10.922 --> 02:14.259
It's okay, Frankie. It
was just an accident.

02:14.342 --> 02:17.804
I know what'll cheer you up.
I'll fix your game gadget!

02:17.887 --> 02:23.184
Dancing pixels, glowing light,
bring Frankie's gadget back to life!

02:27.939 --> 02:31.401
Sorry, Frankie. Guess I'll
have to work on that spell.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.285
The bus is here!

02:43.329 --> 02:45.248
Whoa!

02:46.457 --> 02:49.043
Welcome to the Museum
of Natural History!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.588
Yay!

02:51.671 --> 02:54.924
I'm Mr. Gabmore and
I'll be your tour guide!

02:55.008 --> 02:57.427
And this is Dippy the Diplodocus!

02:57.510 --> 03:00.346
Whoa! What superpowers did she have?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.808
This dinosaur weighed
more than five cars!

03:03.892 --> 03:05.935
Dippy could crush
everything in her path!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.521
Uh, sorry. No touching, please.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.232
We wouldn't want to accidentally
break anything, would we?

03:11.316 --> 03:14.777
Uh... no. No, we wouldn't.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.739
Excellent! Let's get started!

03:22.702 --> 03:26.039
Whoa! These statues are so cute.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.541
I bet you'd have fun
running in the forest!

03:28.625 --> 03:34.130
Uh, no magic please,
Katya. Those statues need to stay put.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.971
Hey, check me out! I found my pack!

03:42.055 --> 03:45.099
Me, too!

03:49.020 --> 03:50.188
Boo!

03:52.357 --> 03:53.191
Oh!

03:54.442 --> 03:57.779
- Uh...
- It's okay, Frankie. I caught it.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.116
Come on, everyone! There's
so much more to see!

04:02.200 --> 04:04.994
Next stop, the butterfly exhibit!

04:07.205 --> 04:09.374
Wow!

04:22.887 --> 04:28.184
Mastodons are in the genus Mammut,
distinctly related to elephants,

04:28.268 --> 04:32.855
that inhabited North and Central
America during the late Mesocene...

04:32.939 --> 04:35.483
Frankie? What's wrong?

04:35.566 --> 04:37.819
Talking about it might
make you feel better.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.362
Mmm-mmm.

04:39.369 --> 04:41.996
Come on. We don't want to miss anything.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.226
They fed on a mixed diet obtained by

04:44.233 --> 04:47.042
browsing and grazing with a seasonal...

05:09.517 --> 05:10.935
Whoa!

05:31.622 --> 05:32.623
Oh...

05:32.707 --> 05:37.211
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare him!

05:37.295 --> 05:38.671
I was just playing.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.799
I think Frankie's
been having a hard day.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.843
We have to find him!

05:43.926 --> 05:48.765
Hmm, let's see... Esmie and I will
look on this side of the museum.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.808
Drac, you check outside.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.563
The rest of you can cover
the rest of the museum.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.900
And, uh... tidy up a bit, please.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.238
Katya, have you got a
spell that can fix this?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.909
Right! No problem. I've got this.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.787
At least I think I do.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.998
Hmm... Okay. Let's try...

06:14.082 --> 06:18.544
Bones of ages on the floor,
connect to make a dinosaur.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.049
Yikes! That's not what's
supposed to happen.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.218
Um, let's try again...

06:25.301 --> 06:30.139
Skeleton that grew and grew,
now change into something new!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.977
Oh, no! Something else new!

06:37.980 --> 06:39.023
Oh, come on!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.537
Frankie! Are you in here?

06:53.121 --> 06:56.165
Ooh, these statues are so cute!

07:05.091 --> 07:06.592
Katya!

07:06.676 --> 07:09.762
What? I just wanted to
play with it for a minute.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.347
Huh?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.189
But now, everything
else wants to play, too!

07:28.239 --> 07:29.740
Sorry about that!

07:36.789 --> 07:37.999
Did you find Frankie?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.668
Uh... nope. But I found something else!

07:43.421 --> 07:45.590
The butterflies from the exhibit!

07:46.340 --> 07:48.009
We need to get them back inside.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.722
It's working, Cleo! It's work...

07:52.805 --> 07:54.098
Whoa!

07:57.935 --> 08:01.397
Good job, Super Monsters!
Now let's find Frankie.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.113
Frankie? What're you doing in here?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.449
I'm trying to cool off.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.577
We've been looking all
over for you. What's wrong?

08:16.120 --> 08:21.918
Aw, come on, buddy. You can tell
me. It's just lil' ol' me. See?

08:28.382 --> 08:30.510
You...

08:31.093 --> 08:32.886
You got hungry and went
looking for a snack!

08:33.763 --> 08:36.515
Hmm... you needed some exercise!

08:37.808 --> 08:40.227
Did you need to let out a big burp?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.687
Lobo!

08:41.770 --> 08:44.357
Okay, okay. You want to go home?

08:45.191 --> 08:49.320
A-ha! You want to go home, 'cause...

08:49.403 --> 08:51.614
Because I ruin everything!

08:51.697 --> 08:52.782
Well, what do you mean?

08:52.865 --> 08:56.285
The owl, the butterflies,
the dinosaur bones...

08:56.369 --> 08:58.955
I just look at something and it breaks!

09:00.665 --> 09:03.501
It's like my body just
does whatever it wants.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.837
It's frustrating! And embarrassing...

09:06.921 --> 09:08.539
Frankie, you never would have knocked

09:08.546 --> 09:10.556
over the skeleton if
I hadn't scared you.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.303
- Yeah, it was an accident.
- We all make mistakes.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.265
Remember when I tripped and
fell into your birthday cake?

09:17.348 --> 09:22.353
Yeah. That was pretty
funny. You were covered in frosting.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.314
It was delicious!

09:25.398 --> 09:28.818
Aw, you know what?

09:28.901 --> 09:33.155
I do feel better. I guess it
does help to talk about it.

09:33.239 --> 09:37.451
Sometimes feelings get too
big to handle all by yourself.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.329
We're always here for you, Frankie.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.958
Thanks, you guys.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.379
Hey! We didn't get to say
goodbye to Mr. Gabmore.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.049
Oh, goodness! You don't
think he's still...

09:52.133 --> 09:53.509
On it!

09:56.512 --> 10:00.850
Now how do I get down from here?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.518
- I got ya.
- Whoa!

10:03.352 --> 10:05.479
Oh! Thank you, Drac.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.692
Thank you, Mr. Gabmore. Your
museum tour was really fun.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.901
I can't wait to come back!

10:10.985 --> 10:13.237
- Really?
- Really.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.364
Bye!

10:24.665 --> 10:27.168
Sun up...

10:29.503 --> 10:30.504
Drac!

10:31.964 --> 10:32.965
Katya!

10:35.051 --> 10:36.052
Lobo!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.055
Frankie!

10:40.389 --> 10:41.390
Zoe!

10:43.934 --> 10:45.227
Cleo!

10:45.311 --> 10:47.480
Super Monsters!

10:57.782 --> 11:00.201
- Hello, Lobo.
- Hi, Esmie.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.914
Hi, Igor! Wait till you see
what I brought for show-and-tell!

11:04.997 --> 11:08.668
Ah... sounds very mysterious.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.758
- Who wants to race?
- I do!

11:15.841 --> 11:16.967
Me, too!

11:22.306 --> 11:23.766
Hey! Where'd it go?

11:25.684 --> 11:27.436
Looking for this?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.023
Thanks, Esmie.

11:34.985 --> 11:38.239
The sun is setting. And that means...

11:38.322 --> 11:39.865
Sun down...

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
Monsters up!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.329
Drac!

11:47.998 --> 11:49.208
Katya!

11:51.293 --> 11:53.379
Lobo!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.590
Frankie!

11:58.926 --> 12:00.511
Zoe!

12:03.097 --> 12:04.098
Cleo!

12:04.181 --> 12:06.183
Super Monsters!

12:07.601 --> 12:09.854
Is it time for show-and-tell? Whoo-hoo!

12:11.522 --> 12:13.107
Is it? Is it?

12:13.190 --> 12:16.026
Show-and-tell is exciting, isn't it?

12:16.110 --> 12:19.447
We get to share things
that are important to us

12:19.530 --> 12:23.367
and learn interesting
things about our friends.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.454
We have other fun activities
planned for tonight, too!

12:26.537 --> 12:29.665
An art project and a trip to the park.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.333
Wait till you see what I brought!

12:31.417 --> 12:33.627
It's really, really, really,
really, really, really special!

12:33.711 --> 12:36.505
Well, since it's
something really special,

12:36.589 --> 12:40.301
you'll want to be sure that
you're really careful with it.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.760
I will!

12:41.844 --> 12:44.096
It's in my pocket.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.852
Mmm-mmm-mmm, yum!

12:49.935 --> 12:53.814
Lobo, if you want to tell me what
you brought for show-and-tell,

12:53.898 --> 12:56.567
I promise I won't spoil your surprise.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.613
Okay! It's really awesome.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.618
Wow! A whole silver dollar!

13:06.368 --> 13:07.995
Oh, look! My favorite cookie!

13:13.292 --> 13:15.085
It's time for show-and-tell!

13:15.169 --> 13:17.254
Yay!

13:21.509 --> 13:24.220
First, I mix the dirt up a little...

13:25.554 --> 13:28.390
then I water it, and then...

13:33.896 --> 13:36.190
Baseball's extra fun when you can fly.

13:42.279 --> 13:47.034
I brought my super cozy, extra
fuzzy wuzzy favorite slippers!

13:48.160 --> 13:49.495
Aren't they snuggly?

13:50.079 --> 13:54.500
Um, Zoe? We can't see
through the box like you.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.585
Oh. Oops!

13:59.588 --> 14:00.798
They're so soft!

14:01.549 --> 14:02.424
My turn?

14:02.508 --> 14:07.471
Yes, Lobo, it's your turn. We
can't wait to see what you brought.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.308
I brought a real live silver dollar!

14:11.392 --> 14:13.269
I earned it cleaning out fur brushes.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.522
Where'd it go?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.108
Why don't you check your backpack?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.325
Hey! Here's that cool
rock I found at the park!

14:28.409 --> 14:30.327
That is a nice rock,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.830
but I think you were looking
for your silver dollar?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.331
Oh, right.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.250
Huh. It's not in here!

14:36.333 --> 14:38.335
Would you like me to
help you look for it?

14:38.419 --> 14:41.672
No, thanks, Esmie. I'm sure
I can find it by myself.

14:41.755 --> 14:45.426
Okay. Well, when you do, we'll
have the rest of show-and-tell.

14:46.635 --> 14:50.055
I wish I could remember
where I put my silver dollar.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.141
Would you like us to help
you look for it, Lobo?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.851
I could do a finding spell.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.437
No thanks, Katya. I'm
sure I can remember.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.693
All right, everyone, it's
time to go to the park!

15:02.776 --> 15:04.570
Yay!

15:06.488 --> 15:08.240
Whee!

15:10.451 --> 15:11.577
Whee!

15:12.953 --> 15:13.829
Hooray!

15:19.293 --> 15:22.046
You're good at yo-yoing, Lobo.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.719
Oh, oops! Here, I'll unwind you.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.429
Whoa!

15:34.683 --> 15:36.560
Whoa!

15:37.269 --> 15:39.396
That was fun!

15:43.067 --> 15:44.276
Where did my yo-yo go?

15:48.572 --> 15:50.240
Can I play with your bat, Drac?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.952
Uh, sure. But try not to lose it, okay?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
I promise I'll be careful!

16:17.142 --> 16:20.771
Oh! This flower is the same
color as my favorite crayon!

16:25.401 --> 16:26.819
Hello, bunny! Where are you going?

16:28.904 --> 16:33.117
Calling all Super Monsters!
It's time to walk back to school.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.451
Bye-bye, bunny.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.456
Oops, I'd better find my yo-yo.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.419
Where's my yo-yo?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.422
And where's Drac's bat and ball?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.341
Oh, no! First, I lost my silver dollar,

16:49.425 --> 16:52.720
now I've lost my yo-yo
and Drac's bat and ball!

16:53.345 --> 16:54.555
Time to go, Lobo.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.275
Oh... What's the matter, Lobo?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.903
I lost my yo-yo and Drac's bat and
ball. But I don't want to tell Drac.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.238
It will make him sad.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.367
I know you feel bad, Lobo,
but you have to tell Drac.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.037
It's important to keep
track of your things

17:18.119 --> 17:20.204
and your friends' things as well.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.253
Drac... I lost your bat
and ball at the park,

17:27.337 --> 17:29.590
and I'm really, really sorry.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.175
Oh, no!

17:31.258 --> 17:35.429
And I lost my yo-yo and
my silver dollar, too.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.391
Well, maybe if we all look
together, we can find everything.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.019
That's a great idea, Drac!

17:42.102 --> 17:45.147
Let's all try to help
Lobo and search together.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.733
Like a treasure hunt.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.072
Nothing up here.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.077
Not here.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.664
Hmm. Not behind the wall.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.169
Not under the chair.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.800
Not here, either.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.078
Uh, I'm trying really hard, but I can't

18:15.085 --> 18:17.560
remember where I put my silver dollar.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.350
Maybe you need a remembering
song. Let's see...

18:21.433 --> 18:23.977

18:24.061 --> 18:26.522

18:45.791 --> 18:47.701
Peanut butter! I remember that I had a

18:47.708 --> 18:49.968
peanut butter sandwich for my snack...

18:51.380 --> 18:55.592
...and I showed Cleo my silver
dollar while I was eating it!

18:55.676 --> 18:59.346
My silver dollar!

18:59.429 --> 19:01.507
Now, let's go back to the park and look

19:01.514 --> 19:03.857
for Lobo's yo-yo and
Drac's bat and ball.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.063
Let's look over here.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.902
♪ Stop, think Take another look ♪

19:14.444 --> 19:18.740

yo-yo string, me spinning...

♪ On the roof or on the floor ♪

19:21.827 --> 19:24.580
The roof! Maybe it's not on the ground.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.002
Ha! I found Lobo's yo-yo!

19:32.588 --> 19:33.964
Thanks, Drac!

19:34.756 --> 19:37.134
Now, I'm going to
find your bat and ball!

19:52.274 --> 19:55.652
Hey, I smell something furry...

19:56.862 --> 19:59.198
A bunny!

20:02.075 --> 20:05.370
Wait! I remember I dropped the
bat and ball when I saw the bunny!

20:05.454 --> 20:08.707
And I remember I found an orange flower

20:08.790 --> 20:11.001
the exact color of my
favorite orange crayon

20:11.084 --> 20:12.961
before I chased the bunny!

20:14.296 --> 20:17.090
And here's Drac's bat and ball!

20:19.301 --> 20:20.844
Oh, thanks, Lobo!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.473
Lobo, I'm really proud of you

20:24.556 --> 20:28.101
for taking the time to think
through all the steps you took before

20:28.185 --> 20:31.313
so you could remember where
you left Drac's bat and ball.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.993
From now on, I'm going
to be more careful

20:34.000 --> 20:36.658
and pay attention to
where I leave things,

20:36.735 --> 20:39.071
so I can find them again later!

20:44.368 --> 20:46.245
Sun up...

20:48.288 --> 20:49.289
Drac!

20:50.999 --> 20:52.000
Katya!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.087
Lobo!

20:56.797 --> 20:58.090
Frankie!

20:59.424 --> 21:00.425
Zoe!

21:03.011 --> 21:04.304
Cleo!

21:04.930 --> 21:06.890
Super Monsters!
