WEBVTT

00:00.149 --> 00:02.019
You're not gonna say
where you work?

00:02.139 --> 00:05.598
- In an office.
- That sounds mysterious.

00:05.718 --> 00:07.991
I'm trying to get on with it.
Do you understand?

00:08.111 --> 00:11.151
Do me the favor of not pretending
you were ever on board with this.

00:11.271 --> 00:14.235
Nation-wide network of
organized criminals.

00:14.355 --> 00:15.420
It's real, Edgar.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.909
Political agitators,
that's real.

00:17.964 --> 00:19.048
Agent Nox...

00:19.111 --> 00:22.194
Postman, then the
Bureau of Prohibition.

00:22.251 --> 00:24.394
Agent Nox is a hayseed

00:24.514 --> 00:26.615
of the purest variety.

00:26.912 --> 00:28.348
They arrested Clayton.

00:28.468 --> 00:29.916
They said he poisoned Henry.

00:30.451 --> 00:32.363
What would somebody do
something like that?

00:32.674 --> 00:34.640
I promise, you can live with it.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.362
We'll get you into
another school,

00:36.482 --> 00:37.819
if that's what's necessary.

00:37.939 --> 00:39.323
You're going to graduate.

00:39.846 --> 00:41.661
Mr. Pierce, these
are my partners,

00:41.781 --> 00:43.543
Misters Lansky and Luciano.

00:43.663 --> 00:44.544
_

00:44.664 --> 00:47.155
_

00:47.383 --> 00:48.601
_

00:48.824 --> 00:50.174
This is bad for me.

00:50.294 --> 00:51.734
You do what you
want, but I'm in.

00:51.854 --> 00:54.236
- We're partners.
- Not anymore.

00:55.166 --> 00:58.069
I saw you watching
me last night.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.173
And I know what you are.

01:03.851 --> 01:05.825
***

01:07.334 --> 01:09.850
Word is they were
Chicago detectives.

01:10.072 --> 01:13.354
Every fucking thing that
crawls is gonna pay.

01:20.216 --> 01:22.719

02:55.414 --> 02:58.077

03:00.612 --> 03:03.285
Paperboy: "Chicago
American," right here.

03:03.321 --> 03:05.355
Three cents. Three cents.
That's all, folks.

03:05.388 --> 03:07.763
Three cents. "Chicago American."

Get your papers. Papers.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.426

03:13.834 --> 03:17.404
- Woman: There he goes!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

03:17.437 --> 03:20.037
Man: Someone stop that car.

03:20.078 --> 03:22.310
- Is he...
- Get Father Sheridan.

03:23.713 --> 03:25.585
Could be nothing, Eli.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.388
I'm not saying it's something.

03:28.421 --> 03:30.228
Just that it's odd.

03:30.261 --> 03:31.725
JMT.

03:31.758 --> 03:34.565
There's something
cockeyed about this guy.

03:34.598 --> 03:36.734
Who carries around
another man's hankie?

03:36.767 --> 03:38.303
You were.

03:38.336 --> 03:40.136
He gave it to me so I
could blow my nose.

03:40.169 --> 03:41.543
Maybe someone gave it to him.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.081
Let's get his boss on the horn.

03:47.114 --> 03:48.250
What for?

03:48.283 --> 03:50.453
I don't know. Peace of mind.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.691
Sid.

03:53.724 --> 03:56.290
Sid!

04:00.130 --> 04:01.363
Need something?

04:01.396 --> 04:03.395
Why the fuck else would
I be calling for you?

04:03.436 --> 04:06.034
Fred Elliot... Frederick.

04:06.131 --> 04:08.137
He's a supervisor with
the Treasury Department.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.473
- He's in my book.
- You want his number?

04:10.506 --> 04:12.012
I want you to get
him on the phone.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.783
Right. Righty-o.

04:17.521 --> 04:19.784
So what's the word from Tampa?

04:21.353 --> 04:23.623
First shipment in a few days.

04:25.296 --> 04:28.597
So things got rough
down there, hmm?

04:28.630 --> 04:30.725
What?

04:30.765 --> 04:33.501
Heard you came back
with a black eye.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.763
I banged a door.

04:35.796 --> 04:37.363
That so?

04:37.404 --> 04:39.631
What, Eli?

04:39.664 --> 04:41.968
They got phones, you
know, down in Florida.

04:42.001 --> 04:45.609
- I spoke to McCoy.
- And?

04:45.643 --> 04:47.611
Nothing.

04:47.644 --> 04:51.612
Just said this Sally,
she's a pistol is all.

04:51.653 --> 04:54.620
McCoy's a fucking idiot.
I banged a door.

04:54.653 --> 04:57.091
After you banged her.

04:58.988 --> 05:01.357
Sid: Say, Nuck.

05:01.398 --> 05:02.999
Elliot's not there.

05:03.032 --> 05:05.334
- Did you leave a message?
- That's the thing.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.919
The Prohee I talked to, he said
Elliot don't work there no more.

05:17.481 --> 05:18.982
( Sneezes )

05:19.015 --> 05:20.848
Edgar: Gesundheit.

05:20.881 --> 05:22.954
Cherry blossom season.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.808
What's wrong?

05:35.907 --> 05:37.643
Remus asked for hotcakes.

05:37.678 --> 05:40.852
May I remind you that you
are a federal prisoner?

05:40.885 --> 05:43.316
Remus is also a
cooperating witness.

05:43.349 --> 05:47.126
We'll stop at the
Mayflower later.

05:49.327 --> 05:51.595
So, Enoch Thompson.

05:51.628 --> 05:54.796
When we spoke in January, you
said he was the linchpin

05:54.829 --> 05:56.870
of a nationwide
criminal conspiracy.

05:56.903 --> 05:58.365
That's what you said.

05:58.405 --> 06:00.330
Remus said he was a
piece of dog shit.

06:00.371 --> 06:04.335
Conducting illegal activities with
individuals from various cities.

06:04.368 --> 06:07.507
I would like you to confirm
that for Mr. Hoover.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.875
( Sighs )

06:09.908 --> 06:11.683
Remus confirms it.

06:11.716 --> 06:14.083
And Mr. Thompson did business
with you in Cincinnati?

06:14.116 --> 06:17.654
- Remus rues the day...
- Stop doing that.

06:17.687 --> 06:19.183
Doing what?

06:19.207 --> 06:20.847
Referring to yourself
in the third person.

06:20.871 --> 06:22.303
Remus will say
whatever he pleases.

06:22.344 --> 06:25.804
And I will have you
transferred to Leavenworth.

06:27.773 --> 06:29.740
What do you know about Tampa?

06:29.773 --> 06:32.413
- It's humid.
- Relative to Nucky Thompson.

06:32.446 --> 06:34.413
Nothing. What should Remus...

06:37.857 --> 06:39.289
What should I know?

06:43.026 --> 06:44.729
Go get your hotcakes.

06:56.979 --> 06:58.945
Satisfied?

06:58.978 --> 07:02.809
Every time he talks, he gets
out of jail for the night,

07:02.882 --> 07:05.249
free meals, cushy hotel room.

07:05.282 --> 07:07.282
That doesn't mean what
he's saying isn't true.

07:07.322 --> 07:10.186
- He did give us Harry Daugherty.
- Daugherty's one man.

07:10.219 --> 07:12.459
I haven't even been sworn
in yet and you're asking me

07:12.492 --> 07:16.131
to commit tens of thousands more
into building a conspiracy case.

07:16.164 --> 07:18.762
A dozen arrests in
one fell swoop.

07:18.795 --> 07:20.066
Think of the headlines, Edgar.

07:20.099 --> 07:22.834
And think of the
headlines if I fail.

07:22.868 --> 07:25.673
"New Bureau Chief Lays an Egg."

07:27.074 --> 07:30.179
You promised me a weak link
in Thompson's organization.

07:30.212 --> 07:32.013
I'm working on that.

07:33.047 --> 07:35.785
Agent Tolliver, you have a call.

07:35.818 --> 07:37.554
Pardon me.

07:42.131 --> 07:43.897
( Sighs )

07:44.995 --> 07:46.434
I know it's none of my business,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.898
but it might behoove you to
get on board with his plan.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.367
Why is that?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.967
Because our new Attorney General
thinks it's a great idea.

07:55.807 --> 07:58.142
( Music playing )

07:58.175 --> 08:00.343
( men laughing )

08:02.084 --> 08:04.452
Johnny, how you doing?
Good? You good?

08:04.485 --> 08:06.586
Listen, we need to talk. You hungry?
You hungry?

08:06.651 --> 08:08.617
Get him a steak, rare.

08:08.650 --> 08:11.456
- I just had lunch.
- You said you wanted to see me.

08:11.489 --> 08:13.192
I did.

08:13.225 --> 08:14.931
This you?

08:17.099 --> 08:18.994
Jeez, another one?

08:19.035 --> 08:21.034
That's a shame for
his family, huh?

08:21.067 --> 08:23.801
I mean, for all we know, the
guy got a couple of brothers.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.074
You know, an old mother bawling
her eyes out every night.

08:26.098 --> 08:27.698
- You think it's funny?
- No, I don't.

08:27.732 --> 08:29.583
I'm gonna get that
fuck O'Banion.

08:29.614 --> 08:31.877
Put a pill in him myself.
Make it public.

08:31.910 --> 08:34.115
Remind people you
bleed before you die.

08:34.148 --> 08:36.283
Why you want to move
on Deanie O'Banion?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.918
For Frank, John.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.056
You got nothing puts
O'Banion in that.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.789
I got a dozen mick cops don't
even let him get his hands up.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.156
- That don't mean O'Banion.
- They hit nobody but Frank.

08:45.197 --> 08:47.026
- What, a whole crowd of people?
- Al. Al.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.796
- No, they were probably after me.
- Al!

08:51.269 --> 08:53.603
It's not gonna happen.

08:53.636 --> 08:56.634
It's my brother, John.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.073
You... you seen what they did.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.776
I saw. Buon'anima.

09:02.873 --> 09:05.777
But Chicago cops,
not Dean O'Banion.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.377
Bullshit! He paid 'em off.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.175
You want to take on
the Chicago Police?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.243
- They'll send a fucking army down here.
- ( sniffles )

09:12.276 --> 09:14.747
We're not starting a war.

09:14.812 --> 09:16.180
We'd crush 'em, John.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.686
I have business
with Dean O'Banion,

09:18.719 --> 09:21.756
which you will not impede.

09:27.764 --> 09:29.260
I didn't ask for this.

09:29.301 --> 09:31.469
( Plate shatters )

09:35.370 --> 09:37.000
( sniffles )

09:41.645 --> 09:43.844
I hear big things about RCA.

09:43.877 --> 09:46.210
You can't touch the
stocks the big noise can,

09:46.243 --> 09:48.979
but what you can do
is buy into a trust.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.420
What about pools?

09:50.453 --> 09:52.726
My wife's father says they're
a lot more profitable.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.325
And a lot more expensive.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.723
The last pool I knew of,

09:55.756 --> 09:58.123
the minimum buy-in was 75,000.

09:58.156 --> 09:59.092
( Exhales )

09:59.125 --> 10:00.796
Now, the Anaconda Realty Trust

10:00.829 --> 10:02.429
is what you need
to be looking at.

10:02.462 --> 10:04.101
If it were my money, sure,

10:04.134 --> 10:06.973
but Dottie's got
ideas of her own.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.669
( Knocks, opens door )

10:08.702 --> 10:11.574
You have the meeting with the
gentleman at the Cunard Line, sir.

10:11.607 --> 10:14.646
Call me a cab, please.
Oh, Mrs. Rohan.

10:14.679 --> 10:16.817
Yes, Mr. Bennett?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.922
I don't mean to put
you on the spot.

10:18.955 --> 10:21.623
Didn't I put your husband in
Anaconda Realty last year?

10:21.656 --> 10:24.654
You tried, sir, yes.

10:24.687 --> 10:26.087
I tried?

10:26.127 --> 10:28.425
I'm sorry, sir, I never told you

10:28.465 --> 10:30.202
because I was too embarrassed.

10:30.267 --> 10:33.200
I put your husband in Anaconda Realty.
I'm certain of it.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.333
You advised him, that's correct.

10:35.366 --> 10:38.565
But we've four wee ones
and it was a risk.

10:40.103 --> 10:42.272
I talked him out of investing.

10:42.313 --> 10:45.208
- Oh, you didn't.
- I did, sir.

10:45.248 --> 10:47.014
I'm sorry.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.813
What happened?

10:48.846 --> 10:51.487
Fortune down the drain,
that's what happened.

10:52.891 --> 10:55.554
It's a woman's place
to tend to the home.

10:55.595 --> 10:57.688
It's a man's to
tend to the future.

10:57.729 --> 11:00.494
That'll be all, Mrs.
Rohan. Thank you.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.138
What time is your meeting?

11:06.172 --> 11:09.274
15 minutes.

11:10.706 --> 11:13.544
Tell me about this Anaconda.

11:13.577 --> 11:16.114
- ( Music playing )
- 40 minutes I'm waiting.

11:16.147 --> 11:17.516
He'll be along.

11:17.548 --> 11:19.577
( Speaks Italian )

11:19.618 --> 11:21.216
What, am I six years old?

11:21.249 --> 11:22.919
Almond torte from Veniero's.

11:22.952 --> 11:27.059
We got the same thing in Coney Island.
Gargiulo's.

11:29.926 --> 11:33.225
Frankie Yale. They finally
run you out of Brooklyn?

11:33.266 --> 11:35.127
No, Charlie, I come
by for the cake.

11:36.232 --> 11:39.635
( Speaks Italian )

11:50.779 --> 11:53.345
- Been out in the sun.
- Cut the crap, huh?

11:53.386 --> 11:55.719
I've been down in Tampa
and you know it.

11:55.784 --> 11:57.813
You and your pal Meyer.

11:57.854 --> 11:59.548
What of it?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.083
We got business, him and me.

12:01.116 --> 12:04.021
You, him, and Nucky Thompson.

12:04.054 --> 12:05.492
You buried all that with Nucky.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.027
I was there, remember?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.224
You forgive that easy?
That's good to know.

12:09.258 --> 12:10.855
How about you cross
me and find out?

12:10.888 --> 12:14.630
And for the record, I ain't
in business with Thompson.

12:14.664 --> 12:16.802
Vincenzo Petrucelli,

12:16.835 --> 12:18.466
he call me on the telephone.

12:18.499 --> 12:21.672
I turned it down, Joe.
( speaks Italian )

12:22.736 --> 12:24.038
I know.

12:26.142 --> 12:27.639
So what am I doing here?

12:27.672 --> 12:29.975
There's a different deal.
Very lucrative.

12:30.008 --> 12:32.343
Petrucelli's the biggest
importer of heroin

12:32.376 --> 12:34.351
in the whole southeast.

12:34.384 --> 12:35.875
Since when?

12:35.899 --> 12:37.539
Since he killed Joe
Raguto in New Orleans.

12:37.563 --> 12:40.036
Straight-razored his throat
during last year's Mardi Gras.

12:40.922 --> 12:42.688
Go back to Tampa.

12:42.721 --> 12:45.024
Talk to Petrucelli.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.959
Those trucks he send up
here with the rum...

12:49.969 --> 12:53.109
maybe they carry
something for us, too.

12:56.971 --> 12:59.145
( Distant chatter and laughter )

12:59.178 --> 13:01.580
Doris: It says here
they read Nietzsche.

13:03.454 --> 13:05.083
Who did?

13:05.107 --> 13:06.759
Those boys who killed
that kid in Chicago.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.295
They thought they were supermen

13:09.328 --> 13:11.263
who could get away with murder.

13:16.265 --> 13:18.335
Keep your head down.

13:18.401 --> 13:20.071
Relax.

13:20.104 --> 13:23.070
You relax. Me now.

13:33.051 --> 13:35.753
I read "Zarathustra"
in high school.

13:35.786 --> 13:39.487
All that "God is dead" malarkey.

13:47.532 --> 13:49.800
You believe in God, don't you?

13:49.834 --> 13:51.969
Of course.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.214
Why would you ask me that?

13:56.247 --> 13:58.952
I didn't mean anything by it.

14:09.664 --> 14:11.430
You're leaving?

14:11.463 --> 14:14.061
You want me to stay?
Then say that.

14:14.101 --> 14:16.597
Did I do something wrong?

14:16.638 --> 14:18.237
Don't be dim.

14:19.638 --> 14:22.869
- Okay.
- ( laughs )

14:23.973 --> 14:25.812
Next time we should
use your room.

14:27.046 --> 14:29.616
Have they put someone
else in yet?

14:29.649 --> 14:31.186
No.

14:31.219 --> 14:35.122
I heard Clayton's parents gave
everything to the Salvation Army.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.592
Has he written you or anything?

14:38.625 --> 14:41.128
- Jesus Christ, Doris.
- What?

14:41.193 --> 14:43.667
First those boys back in
Chicago, now Clayton.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.373
When did you get so morbid?

14:46.406 --> 14:49.242
I was just making conversation.

14:49.275 --> 14:50.441
Yeah?

14:50.474 --> 14:52.472
Why don't you make it
with someone else?

14:52.505 --> 14:54.842
And now you're leaving again?

14:56.413 --> 14:58.519
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

14:58.552 --> 15:00.988
( Door closes )

15:08.325 --> 15:10.565
- ( machines chugging )
- ( chatter )

15:13.995 --> 15:17.066
It's awful, like a knitting
needle in the gut.

15:17.099 --> 15:19.805
My Aunt Ann would be a
week in bed each month.

15:19.838 --> 15:22.447
A week? I'd cut off my own head.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.344
Bennett: Miss Preston,
feeling better?

15:24.385 --> 15:26.045
I am, sir. Thank you.

15:26.078 --> 15:28.212
She tell you how she
closed Jeff Romsey?

15:28.245 --> 15:31.222
Reeled him in for a
cool five grand.

15:31.255 --> 15:32.921
Romsey's got that kind of dough?

15:32.954 --> 15:34.595
Well, Mrs. Romsey does.

15:34.628 --> 15:36.131
Will he make money?

15:36.164 --> 15:37.825
Well, it's a real estate trust.

15:37.866 --> 15:40.497
A lot of different stocks
in there, mostly dogs.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.666
Some with less
fleas than others.

15:42.739 --> 15:45.268
Will he make money? Who knows?

15:45.308 --> 15:47.845
You, on the other hand,

15:47.878 --> 15:50.414
I see an immediate fiscal gain

15:50.447 --> 15:52.383
in your future.

15:56.691 --> 15:59.329
And to think I
considered waitressing.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.438
Your boy Al,

16:07.471 --> 16:10.309
he's pixilated or something.
He won't listen to reason.

16:10.374 --> 16:12.845
He's grieving. He'll
right himself.

16:12.878 --> 16:14.740
Either that or sink stern first.

16:14.781 --> 16:17.078
He's under control for now.

16:17.119 --> 16:19.551
But his suspicions regarding
you and those cops...

16:19.584 --> 16:21.887
On my mother, John. I swear.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.257
It wasn't us.

16:28.597 --> 16:31.471
I believe you, okay? Relax.

16:34.606 --> 16:37.444
So, the brewery, Sieben's.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.181
Fine, I'll take it
off your hands.

16:39.246 --> 16:40.752
Our full price?

16:40.785 --> 16:43.016
I just said fine.
Don't bend me over.

16:43.049 --> 16:45.687
And Greektown?

16:45.720 --> 16:47.887
That I have to say no to.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.326
For the love of Mike, John.
We helped you take Cicero.

16:50.359 --> 16:53.465
And you can't give me a few lousy
blocks bordering my own territory?

16:53.498 --> 16:56.401
I do that and the Southside
becomes the Northside.

16:56.434 --> 16:59.136
We gave you that election
with an apple in its mouth.

16:59.169 --> 17:00.904
Practically handed it to you.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.608
And this is your payback.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.540
Half a million on a brewery

17:04.574 --> 17:07.007
I need like a hole
in my fucking head.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.881
You can make anything there...
Beer, pop, whatever you like.

17:09.914 --> 17:12.513
I'm selling fucking Nehi now?

17:12.554 --> 17:16.086
Hey, Papa, relax.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.118
You think this squares
us, then swell.

17:18.152 --> 17:20.022
And you don't think
it squares us.

17:20.056 --> 17:22.559
I'll tell you what.
Think some more.

17:29.532 --> 17:32.332
( Moaning )

17:43.474 --> 17:45.475
Come now, settle down.

17:45.508 --> 17:47.948
Settle down.

17:47.981 --> 17:50.316
Just a few drops, Gillian.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.516
Do that for me?

18:05.998 --> 18:08.404
( Heaves )

18:08.437 --> 18:10.803
( coughing )

18:27.222 --> 18:29.990
I dreamt

18:30.022 --> 18:32.265
I died.

18:36.736 --> 18:38.903
I'm sorry.

18:41.072 --> 18:43.439

18:57.121 --> 18:59.728

20:15.701 --> 20:17.604
This is it?

20:17.637 --> 20:19.403
This is all you've got on Knox?

20:19.436 --> 20:24.137
I believe your request was
for any and all background.

20:24.170 --> 20:27.903
I'd already provided his employment
application over the telephone.

20:27.944 --> 20:30.742
So he's had mumps and earned a
D in civics in fifth grade.

20:30.775 --> 20:34.340
Which, no doubt, set him
down the path to Bolshevism

20:34.413 --> 20:36.873
and other unsavory activities.

20:38.809 --> 20:41.747
If you're willing to do blackface,
you can go on after this number.

20:41.788 --> 20:43.883
I don't mean to make
light of your request,

20:43.916 --> 20:47.952
but there's simply no further
information to provide.

20:47.985 --> 20:51.718
I have spoken with his
superiors, his former colleges.

20:51.759 --> 20:53.728
JMT. The handkerchief.

20:53.761 --> 20:55.962
An acronym, perhaps.

20:55.995 --> 20:58.433
The John Muir Trail.

20:59.694 --> 21:01.966
It's a hiking route in
the Sierra Nevadas.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.199
Monogrammed on a hankie?

21:03.232 --> 21:05.736
I'm merely exhausting
all possibilities.

21:11.113 --> 21:13.080
And no word on Elliot?

21:13.113 --> 21:16.015
Retired from the bureau.
Sold his home.

21:16.048 --> 21:17.719
No forwarding address.

21:17.753 --> 21:20.217
Without so much as a good-bye.

21:24.995 --> 21:27.162
What's wrong, Mr. Thompson?

21:29.433 --> 21:31.296
What troubles you so?

21:31.328 --> 21:34.909
You ever wake up, have a
vague feeling of unease?

21:35.910 --> 21:37.190
Like you know something's wrong,

21:37.214 --> 21:39.811
but you can't put your
finger on it yet.

21:39.844 --> 21:43.851
When I do, I usually
just go back to sleep.

You're on.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.549

they're no investment.

22:39.582 --> 22:43.051
- Trade up. Cash them in for opportunity.
- ( knocks )

22:43.084 --> 22:46.422
Sir, you've a meeting with the
gentleman from the Cunard Line.

22:46.455 --> 22:47.654
Thank you.

22:47.695 --> 22:50.691
Mrs. Rohan, say hello
to Abe Redstone.

22:50.756 --> 22:52.689
Pleasure to make...

22:57.531 --> 22:59.805
( chuckles )

22:59.838 --> 23:01.870
Hello.

23:01.903 --> 23:04.372
Mrs. Rohan, is it?

23:04.405 --> 23:06.475
It is. Yes, sir.

23:06.508 --> 23:08.942
I was just telling
Abe here how...

23:08.983 --> 23:11.519
Hmm.

23:11.552 --> 23:14.856
I have the distinct feeling
we've met somewhere before.

23:16.752 --> 23:18.559
I'm sure you're mistaken.

23:18.592 --> 23:21.594
- I'd have remembered.
- Mmm...

23:22.835 --> 23:25.666
( clicks tongue ) I have it.

23:25.699 --> 23:27.434
Gloves.

23:27.467 --> 23:30.906
- I beg your pardon?
- You attended to me at Best & Company.

23:30.939 --> 23:32.611
Finer men's accessories.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.244
I'm afraid I've never
worked there, sir.

23:38.045 --> 23:41.084
Well, my mistake, then.

23:42.318 --> 23:45.294
So I was just telling Abe here

23:45.359 --> 23:48.358
how I put your husband
into Anaconda.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.000
Right. Yes, you did.

23:54.073 --> 23:57.536
And what does your
husband do, Mrs...

23:57.569 --> 23:59.607
Rohan.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.144
He's in sales, sir.

24:01.177 --> 24:03.376
- Railroad equipment.
- Ah, I see.

24:03.449 --> 24:06.788
And he bought into this
Anaconda Realty Trust?

24:06.821 --> 24:09.020
He did, sir, yes.

24:09.053 --> 24:10.756
After I insisted.

24:10.789 --> 24:14.260
You tried to talk him
out of it, right?

24:14.293 --> 24:15.661
Yes.

24:15.694 --> 24:18.061
But I regretted not buying it

24:18.102 --> 24:20.837
and we lost a great
deal of money.

24:20.870 --> 24:22.437
I'm so sorry, Mr. Bennett.

24:22.470 --> 24:25.308
I don't feel well. Excuse me.

24:34.047 --> 24:36.087
Nervous type.

24:39.118 --> 24:41.453
Your cut.

24:45.665 --> 24:47.466
Good week.

24:47.499 --> 24:50.339
Ah, then I see Miss
Maitland is a success.

24:50.372 --> 24:51.674
She all right.

24:51.706 --> 24:54.167
She putting asses in them seats.

25:01.054 --> 25:03.917
I want to talk to you
about extending her run.

25:03.957 --> 25:06.554
That would be impossible.

25:06.587 --> 25:08.583
Why is that?

25:08.616 --> 25:11.024
She's committed to appear in...

25:13.532 --> 25:16.796
Louisville next weekend.

25:16.837 --> 25:18.699
Send 'em somebody else.

25:20.899 --> 25:23.836
And what will you do for me?

25:23.877 --> 25:26.343
Already offered you a whiskey.

25:28.048 --> 25:31.285
The Universal Negro
Improvement Association...

25:31.318 --> 25:34.885
I should like to open a chapter
here on your Northside.

25:36.023 --> 25:38.089
- Like a club?
- A confederation.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.893
A place where like-minded
individuals gather

25:40.926 --> 25:43.396
to promote the free
exchange of ideas.

25:49.997 --> 25:52.802
( Sighs )

25:54.603 --> 25:56.672
Sound congenial enough.

25:56.705 --> 25:58.810
It is.

25:58.843 --> 26:02.073
But its contributions to
the Libyan defy measure.

26:02.106 --> 26:04.440
And Miss Maitland?

26:05.577 --> 26:06.815
The good people of Louisville

26:06.848 --> 26:09.682
will do without her
for another month.

26:09.715 --> 26:14.054
Teacher: "'Scoundrel, ' I said
in a voice husky with rage."

26:14.087 --> 26:18.555
'Follow me or I stab
you where you stand.'

26:18.588 --> 26:21.062
And I broke my way
from the ballroom

26:21.095 --> 26:22.758
into a small antechamber,

26:22.791 --> 26:25.796
dragging him unresistingly
with me as I went.

26:25.829 --> 26:28.626
And in a few seconds
I forced him

26:28.667 --> 26:32.466
by sheer strength against
the wainscoting,

26:32.499 --> 26:34.906
and plunged my sword,

26:34.939 --> 26:37.602
with brute ferocity,

26:37.635 --> 26:40.306
repeatedly through

26:40.339 --> 26:43.779
"and through his bosom."

26:46.087 --> 26:48.223
So...

26:48.256 --> 26:50.991
William Wilson is no more.

26:51.024 --> 26:53.862
Any thoughts on what
Poe is doing here?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.727
Mr. Hemmings?

26:57.768 --> 27:00.934
He's showing how admiration
can turn into hatred.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.534
Very good.

27:02.567 --> 27:04.135
And the result being what?

27:04.168 --> 27:06.144
Girl: The murder of his rival?

27:06.177 --> 27:09.575
Teacher: Which in this case
is another form of murder.

27:09.608 --> 27:11.676
Mr. Thompson?

27:14.878 --> 27:17.014
Mr. Thompson?

27:19.288 --> 27:22.053
Mr. Thompson?

27:22.086 --> 27:23.484
Yes, sir?

27:23.525 --> 27:27.093
The murder of Wilson's
doppelganger is also what?

27:30.499 --> 27:32.505
His own suicide.

27:39.039 --> 27:40.374
( Class murmuring )

27:40.407 --> 27:43.310
Mr. Thompson, where
are you going?

27:43.343 --> 27:46.676
( Murmuring continues )

27:46.708 --> 27:48.978
- ( chatter )
- ( thunder rumbling )

27:53.551 --> 27:55.591
What in the heck was that?

27:55.624 --> 27:57.054
I'm so sorry, sir.

27:57.095 --> 27:58.758
I don't know what came over me.

27:58.791 --> 28:01.892
You girls and your
delicate constitutions.

28:01.925 --> 28:04.092
It won't happen
again, I assure you.

28:04.133 --> 28:07.839
Well, apparently
Redstone was charmed.

28:07.872 --> 28:10.638
He put 150 grand into Anaconda.

28:10.671 --> 28:12.469
What?

28:15.173 --> 28:18.447
From him, not me.

28:24.257 --> 28:26.454
( Phone rings )

28:28.558 --> 28:30.494
Connors and Gould.

28:30.527 --> 28:33.095
Mrs. Thompson, this is
Arnold Rothstein calling.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.294
Did you receive my gift?

28:38.169 --> 28:40.810
I did, sir. Thank you.

28:40.843 --> 28:43.305
Lovely as it was
to see you again,

28:43.346 --> 28:46.773
I will thank you in advance
for your discretion.

28:46.838 --> 28:48.244
Yes, sir.

28:48.277 --> 28:50.446
I'm assuming a
reciprocal arrangement

28:50.479 --> 28:53.384
would be to your
advantage as well?

28:54.888 --> 28:56.215
It would.

28:56.256 --> 29:00.218
- Then until next time.
- ( thunder rumbling )

29:19.544 --> 29:21.374
I must look horrid.

29:21.415 --> 29:24.549
No, on the contrary. You look...

29:26.318 --> 29:28.922
well, I was gonna say at peace.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.925
Now that the poison's
out of your system.

29:40.367 --> 29:43.272
A gentleman in my boudoir

29:43.305 --> 29:47.869
and me like this, no less.

29:47.935 --> 29:50.070
We all carry our
burdens, Gillian.

29:51.809 --> 29:53.914
What are yours?

29:55.052 --> 29:56.417
Ambition.

29:56.450 --> 29:58.952
What's wrong with that?

29:58.985 --> 30:02.353
At the expense of family.

30:03.962 --> 30:06.090
Of love.

30:07.459 --> 30:09.698
These last months
getting to know you...

30:11.803 --> 30:14.866
without people you care
about, it's all...

30:17.603 --> 30:21.149
You take that fella from the
A&P chain that I had you meet.

30:21.214 --> 30:23.886
- At dinner?
- Mr. Hewson from Evansville.

30:23.919 --> 30:26.221
Now, he's a very
difficult personality.

30:26.254 --> 30:29.554
Been making this merger
practically impossible.

30:29.587 --> 30:33.061
Now, normally, a man like
that would get my goat.

30:33.094 --> 30:35.761
But since I met you...

30:37.699 --> 30:40.734
I feel as though none
of that matters.

30:42.637 --> 30:46.837
Did tending to me cause
your affairs to suffer?

30:46.870 --> 30:48.639
I'm so sorry.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.078
Gillian, you're important to me.

30:52.111 --> 30:56.010
Hewson, A&P, everything
else can go hang.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.091
( Cap clatters )

31:07.156 --> 31:08.292
What's this for?

31:08.325 --> 31:10.766
- See what you're buying.
- Give it to him.

31:18.873 --> 31:21.208
Not bad. Warm, though.

31:21.241 --> 31:24.514
- Like your people drink it.
- Like it's meant to be drank.

31:24.547 --> 31:26.683
Torrio: Give him the money.
Get this over with.

31:36.130 --> 31:38.297
- I don't need to count it.
- Count it anyway.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.202
I know where to find you.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.476
Smart buy, Johnny. (
knocks on table )

31:49.509 --> 31:51.778
Place puts out a quiet
1,000 barrels a week.

31:51.811 --> 31:54.115
Yeah, and now I also got
a place to keep my hats.

31:54.148 --> 31:55.580
Bring the car around.

32:00.787 --> 32:03.457
Police! Nobody move!

32:03.490 --> 32:06.130
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- All right, you, up against the wall.

32:06.154 --> 32:08.259
( Gunshots )

32:08.828 --> 32:10.900
- Back it up.
- All right, not so fast.

32:10.933 --> 32:13.833
- What the fuck is this?
- What's it look like?

32:13.867 --> 32:16.633
Come on, hands behind your back.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.200
Well, this is chummy.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.704
Dean O'Banion and John Torrio.

32:20.738 --> 32:23.012
What is that, a peace treaty?

32:23.045 --> 32:24.843
Just a simple real
estate transaction.

32:24.876 --> 32:27.547
Involving a property
housing an ocean of beer.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.282
Read the contract. I
don't own this place.

32:29.315 --> 32:32.121
A raid, Deanie, the minute
you sell me this shithole?

32:32.155 --> 32:33.923
I'm in irons just like you.

32:33.956 --> 32:36.196
- Quit your griping.
- Get these guys to the paddy wagon.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.229
Come on. Let's go. Move it.
Move it.

32:38.262 --> 32:40.993
Woman: Illegal drinking,
horrid jazz music,

32:41.026 --> 32:42.930
all types of low characters.

32:42.963 --> 32:44.963
Shooting hypodermics right
out there in the gutter.

32:44.987 --> 32:47.739
- It's a disgrace.
- We've been told something would be done.

32:47.772 --> 32:49.234
That wood-shingled
house on Baltic.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.871
Yeah, well, I'll
get on over there.

32:50.904 --> 32:52.502
Woman: That's what
you said last time.

32:52.535 --> 32:55.376
- Where Mr. White at?
- Three meetings in a row now.

32:55.409 --> 32:57.346
Mr. White indisposed at present.

32:57.379 --> 32:59.148
That's 'cause he up
there on that boardwalk

32:59.181 --> 33:01.349
disposing himself
with the white folk.

33:01.382 --> 33:04.523
( Crowd murmuring )

33:05.924 --> 33:08.492
( murmuring stops )

33:08.525 --> 33:11.997
With all due respect,
within the past month

33:12.030 --> 33:13.796
we've had two separate incidents

33:13.829 --> 33:17.231
of young men in the community
succumbing to heroin overdoses.

33:17.264 --> 33:19.128
We're looking into
that, Deacon Cuffy.

33:19.169 --> 33:21.969
Cuffy: But if whoever is
peddling this poison persists,

33:22.034 --> 33:24.274
I must inform Mr. White.

33:24.307 --> 33:25.787
- I told him.
- Woman: Tell him again.

33:25.811 --> 33:28.910
Deacon Cuffy, if I may.

33:41.948 --> 33:45.084
Ladies, gentlemen...

33:46.157 --> 33:49.494
I am Dr. Valentine Narcisse.

33:49.527 --> 33:53.499
Though I am not from
here, I am of here,

33:53.532 --> 33:58.531
just as I am of anywhere
the Libyan makes his home.

33:58.564 --> 34:01.741
There is a scourge
in our community

34:01.774 --> 34:03.606
in the guise of heroin.

34:03.639 --> 34:05.370
( Murmuring )

34:05.411 --> 34:09.112
There is a scourge in
the guise of alcohol.

34:09.145 --> 34:11.344
The true scourge, however,

34:11.378 --> 34:13.819
is not disguised at all.

34:13.851 --> 34:17.353
That scourge is apathy on
the part of your leader.

34:17.387 --> 34:19.014
- Yes.
- Yes.

34:19.047 --> 34:20.947
I know your Mr. White.

34:20.981 --> 34:23.219
Know him better
than he realizes.

34:23.253 --> 34:26.358
He's a good man, but a
man whose true purpose

34:26.391 --> 34:28.463
has been clouded by
misguided ambition.

34:28.496 --> 34:30.998
- Woman: Mm-hmm, that's right.
- Narcisse: With his permission

34:31.032 --> 34:33.397
and with the assistance of Mr.
Purnsley,

34:33.429 --> 34:37.900
I have come to breathe new
life into this community,

34:37.933 --> 34:40.574
to aid those who
seek betterment,

34:40.607 --> 34:44.079
to abrogate those who
would hold us back.

34:44.112 --> 34:45.678
With Deacon Cuffy,

34:45.710 --> 34:49.514
we shall restore this community

34:49.547 --> 34:52.350
to its full and
glorious potential.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.518
- Hallelujah.
- Yes!

34:53.551 --> 34:54.717
( Applause )

35:03.430 --> 35:06.736
- Eli: That's not what I said.
- It is, Daddy.

35:06.769 --> 35:08.999
I heard it, too.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.166
Then what I meant was a
girl doesn't need college

35:11.207 --> 35:13.172
the way a boy does
to make her way.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.238
Well, there are plenty of
girls at Willie's school.

35:15.262 --> 35:17.339
- Isn't that right?
- There's a couple.

35:17.372 --> 35:20.746
Cooking, sewing, maybe typing,
that's all you need to know.

35:20.779 --> 35:22.514
But what if I want to learn?

35:25.681 --> 35:27.311
You can take my spot.

35:27.344 --> 35:31.123
- I can?
- No. What's that supposed to mean?

35:33.556 --> 35:35.829
Eli: What does that
mean, take your spot?

35:37.262 --> 35:39.229
- That I'm leaving school.
- What?

35:39.262 --> 35:41.470
Willie, what are you saying?

35:41.503 --> 35:44.335
- I dropped out today.
- Wait a minute, what?

35:44.376 --> 35:46.270
You already left?

35:46.303 --> 35:48.438
I spoke to Dean Carnell
this afternoon.

35:50.942 --> 35:53.213
- Go do the dishes.
- I want to hear this.

35:53.246 --> 35:55.326
Uncle Nucky never needed college.
Look how he's done.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.592
- Will, we discussed this.
- Excuse me, Nuck.

35:58.386 --> 36:01.321
Things get tough,
so you just quit?

36:01.362 --> 36:03.024
What kind of man are you?

36:03.057 --> 36:04.624
June: His friend
Henry who died...

36:04.665 --> 36:06.896
People die. Life goes on, June.

36:06.929 --> 36:10.368
And his life goes on. He's
getting an education.

36:10.401 --> 36:11.904
Listen to your father, Will.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.745
And he doesn't need you to tell
him to listen to his father.

36:13.769 --> 36:15.736
He's gonna listen
because I'm his father.

36:15.769 --> 36:18.449
I was the one who made money for
this family while you were in jail.

36:18.473 --> 36:20.977
- Jail?
- Go to your room right now.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.618
I'm gonna talk to your dean and
you're gonna re-enroll on Monday.

36:29.658 --> 36:31.256
I'm sorry, but I'm not.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.822
Eli.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.725
Let's discuss this tomorrow
when clearer heads can prevail.

36:37.759 --> 36:39.759
My head's clear right now.

36:42.095 --> 36:43.997
And you're gonna do as I say.

36:44.030 --> 36:45.998
- Get your hand off me.
- What?

36:46.071 --> 36:48.736
I said get your hand...

36:48.771 --> 36:50.842
Who you talking to, huh?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.313
Think I'm one of your buddies?

36:52.346 --> 36:53.712
- Eli!
- Eli!

36:53.744 --> 36:55.877
Eli, stop it!

36:57.214 --> 37:00.479
Leave him!

37:00.520 --> 37:03.119
You leave school, you
leave this house!

37:03.152 --> 37:05.552
I'm leaving this house anyway!

37:07.194 --> 37:09.455
( Crying )

37:12.896 --> 37:15.834
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

37:21.338 --> 37:24.112
( Moaning )

37:51.876 --> 37:53.740
Come on, girl.

37:53.780 --> 37:56.242
Too hot for all this now.

38:12.193 --> 38:14.327
So?

38:14.360 --> 38:16.362
What did he say?

38:21.068 --> 38:24.601
You ain't packing
no bags just yet.

38:26.377 --> 38:29.009
I wish I wasn't packing
'em ever again.

38:36.621 --> 38:38.985
What he like?

38:39.018 --> 38:40.985
The doctor?

38:42.091 --> 38:44.229
He's smart.

38:44.262 --> 38:46.901
Lots of people look up to him.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.467
Treat you good?

38:51.500 --> 38:54.109
Not as good as you.

38:56.039 --> 38:58.374
He kin or something?

39:12.889 --> 39:15.121
Where you off to?

39:19.703 --> 39:22.607
My mother was a prostitute.

39:24.574 --> 39:26.708
She was murdered.

39:28.773 --> 39:30.814
I saw it.

39:32.048 --> 39:34.550
She always put me in the closet

39:34.583 --> 39:36.581
with my doll

39:36.614 --> 39:39.283
while she had business.

39:39.316 --> 39:41.721
"Don't peep.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.892
Don't peek."

39:45.694 --> 39:47.692
Sometimes I did.

39:49.061 --> 39:50.595
All the ladies had a jar of lye

39:50.628 --> 39:53.065
they kept under the bed

39:53.098 --> 39:57.665
in case the man got rough,

39:57.698 --> 40:00.506
acted a fool.

40:00.539 --> 40:03.240
One day I saw her
swing that jar.

40:04.807 --> 40:07.070
Man screamed so loud,

40:07.111 --> 40:09.080
sounded like he got lit on fire.

40:09.113 --> 40:11.714
- She ain't take no mess.
- No.

40:13.155 --> 40:15.250
No, she did not.

40:18.289 --> 40:21.192
That man choked her till
she didn't move anymore.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.193
They catch him?

40:25.226 --> 40:28.468
Dr. Narcisse found me.

40:28.501 --> 40:31.671
Put his wings around
me ever since.

40:37.182 --> 40:38.613
You and him ever...

40:38.646 --> 40:40.583
No.

40:40.616 --> 40:42.617
He's a decent man.

40:44.092 --> 40:45.762
So what that make me?

40:45.794 --> 40:48.624
That make you my man.

41:04.514 --> 41:07.208
A year-long engagement
at the Onyx.

41:13.085 --> 41:15.148
Got to think about that.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.422
Pharaoh can make
all things pass.

41:17.455 --> 41:19.529
Well, Pharaoh ain't
had no partners.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.696
Mr. Thompson.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.495
He the kind of partner I like.

41:23.528 --> 41:26.127
- And why's that?
- 'Cause he the silent kind.

41:26.168 --> 41:27.632
( laughs )

41:27.666 --> 41:29.906
Where you going, girl?

41:29.939 --> 41:31.801
New number to rehearse.

41:31.842 --> 41:34.575
Prove to you you
can't do without me.

41:40.147 --> 41:41.586
Shouldn't you be getting home?

41:41.620 --> 41:44.251
Home is wherever
you be, darling.

41:49.828 --> 41:52.762
( Glass clinking )

41:52.795 --> 41:56.163
I'd have used a gavel, but I'm afraid
we'd have an awful mess on our hands.

41:56.196 --> 41:58.331
- ( Men laugh )
- Gentlemen,

41:58.364 --> 42:00.572
Miss Randolph, good evening.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.972
As some of you know, it
is our great good fortune

42:03.005 --> 42:07.675
to have in our midst our nation's
esteemed Treasury Secretary,

42:07.708 --> 42:09.979
the Honorable Andrew Mellon.

42:13.221 --> 42:15.556
If that's your attempt at
sticking my department

42:15.589 --> 42:18.024
with the dinner bill,
you can forget it.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.792
( Men laugh )

42:19.825 --> 42:22.401
Two hours ago, I
had the privilege

42:22.434 --> 42:25.338
of attending a brief
ceremony at the White House

42:25.371 --> 42:27.371
where President Coolidge
made what I consider to be

42:27.395 --> 42:30.038
one of the key appointments
of his administration.

42:30.071 --> 42:32.101
Without further ado,

42:32.142 --> 42:35.639
I give you a young man
whose integrity, zeal,

42:35.680 --> 42:38.618
and sense of morality
knows no bounds.

42:38.651 --> 42:41.383
The new Director of the
Bureau of Investigation,

42:41.416 --> 42:43.812
Mr. John Edgar Hoover.

42:48.758 --> 42:51.024
Thank you, Mr. Attorney General,

42:51.057 --> 42:52.664
for that wonderful introduction.

42:52.697 --> 42:55.197
And thank you all
for being here.

42:55.230 --> 42:58.504
Secretary Mellon, it
is truly my honor.

42:58.537 --> 43:00.970
Many of us in this room

43:01.004 --> 43:04.274
have known and worked with
each other for years.

43:04.379 --> 43:07.807
Heck, Jim Tolliver and I
attended law school together.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.145
Those of you who know me

43:10.178 --> 43:12.681
know I won't stand
for corruption.

43:12.714 --> 43:14.650
Those of you who don't,

43:14.683 --> 43:16.688
well, you'll soon find out.

43:16.721 --> 43:19.220
The previous administration

43:19.253 --> 43:22.054
was lax, shall we say,

43:22.087 --> 43:23.991
in its prosecution of criminals

43:24.024 --> 43:28.000
both within as well as
outside the government.

43:28.033 --> 43:31.661
I stand before you
vowing that will change.

43:31.702 --> 43:34.534
Just recently,

43:34.567 --> 43:38.208
after extensive investigative
work on my part,

43:38.242 --> 43:40.409
I came to a realization

43:40.442 --> 43:45.152
that a nationwide criminal
conspiracy was at work

43:45.185 --> 43:48.585
undermining the very fabric
of our great nation.

43:48.618 --> 43:52.156
Bootleggers and murderers
from New York to Chicago,

43:52.197 --> 43:54.730
from Philadelphia
to Atlantic City

43:54.763 --> 43:57.793
have formed a network
of organized crime,

43:57.826 --> 44:01.468
if you will, one that I
myself will dismantle.

44:01.501 --> 44:04.309
Now I've instructed my
men to build a case

44:04.343 --> 44:07.508
whereby we can prosecute
these coconspirators

44:07.541 --> 44:09.506
en masse in federal court.

44:09.539 --> 44:11.579
( Music playing )

44:11.612 --> 44:14.284
♪ Just like a melody

44:14.317 --> 44:18.755
♪ That lingers on...

44:18.788 --> 44:21.019
What's this?

44:21.052 --> 44:22.755
Not much.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.458
But it was all I
could rustle up.

44:24.491 --> 44:26.791
- You shouldn't have.
- I'm fine.

44:36.506 --> 44:38.643
Gonna spoil me, you know that?

44:40.241 --> 44:42.805
You have no idea.

44:53.617 --> 44:55.752
Why are you smiling?

44:57.888 --> 44:59.391
It's a secret.

44:59.424 --> 45:01.727
Mmm.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.464
It's the secrets that undo us.

45:07.233 --> 45:09.536
Tell me one of yours.

45:14.009 --> 45:16.144
Very well.

45:20.913 --> 45:24.078
Remember when we first met,
I told you I was married?

45:27.456 --> 45:29.195
Yes.

45:30.229 --> 45:34.196
Well, the day after I met you,

45:34.229 --> 45:36.498
I began divorce proceedings.

45:41.836 --> 45:44.370
Now...

45:44.411 --> 45:46.337
what's yours?

45:46.378 --> 45:48.576
Why were you smiling?

45:51.012 --> 45:54.221
I was smiling because you
made me feel something

45:54.254 --> 45:57.124
I haven't felt in
a very long time.

45:57.157 --> 45:59.323
What's that?

46:01.260 --> 46:03.597
Happiness.

46:18.185 --> 46:21.582
- ( Music playing )
- He came to the realization?

46:21.615 --> 46:23.349
That's rich.

46:23.382 --> 46:25.284
I mean, the gall to say that

46:25.317 --> 46:27.789
in front of an entire
group of agents.

46:27.823 --> 46:30.657
The Attorney General, no less.

46:35.263 --> 46:38.462
I'm the one who sold him on
the whole conspiracy angle.

46:38.503 --> 46:40.336
He didn't even want
to address it.

46:40.369 --> 46:43.044
"Extensive investigative work."

46:43.077 --> 46:46.212
I'm the one running the
entire undercover operation.

46:46.245 --> 46:48.578
Yes, regarding that,
Agent Tolliver,

46:48.611 --> 46:51.145
it'd be ever so helpful
if you would refrain

46:51.186 --> 46:54.084
from carrying monogrammed
handkerchiefs.

46:54.125 --> 46:55.925
Don't tell me what to do, Means.

46:55.958 --> 46:59.459
I'm the only one standing
between you and a jail cell.

47:03.462 --> 47:05.670
Why am I surprised?

47:05.703 --> 47:08.004
Edgar was the same
way in law school.

47:08.037 --> 47:10.507
The best predictor
of future behavior

47:10.540 --> 47:12.571
is past behavior.

47:12.604 --> 47:15.743
I'm afraid young Mr. Hoover
proves no exception.

47:30.030 --> 47:32.363
Atlantic City, Nuck.

47:32.396 --> 47:35.098
You want to call that
your own, that's fine.

47:35.131 --> 47:37.266
- What's that supposed...
- This house,

47:37.299 --> 47:39.665
this family...

47:42.906 --> 47:45.337
this is mine.

47:50.374 --> 47:55.143
Put your hands on
me in my own home?

47:55.176 --> 47:57.113
Was I supposed to let
you kill the kid?

47:57.154 --> 47:59.615
The fuck you know about it?

47:59.648 --> 48:01.950
- What?
- Kids.

48:03.184 --> 48:05.890
Nothing ever came from you.

48:05.923 --> 48:08.059
You never had a family.

48:08.100 --> 48:09.562
You're drunk, Eli.

48:09.595 --> 48:12.560
Nothing ever came from you.

48:13.799 --> 48:15.904
Mabel died trying
to give you a son.

48:15.937 --> 48:17.843
That's enough.

48:18.740 --> 48:21.444
Not my family.

48:24.447 --> 48:27.289
I'm going to chalk this up
to whiskey and bad timing.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.193
As for Willie, he's a good kid.

48:29.226 --> 48:32.424
But like his father, sometimes
he acts without thinking.

48:38.127 --> 48:41.269
- ( Car starts )
- Man: All right, boss.

48:43.470 --> 48:46.637
My family, Nucky.

48:46.670 --> 48:49.675
My goddamn family!

48:50.508 --> 48:52.739
( Music playing )

48:54.875 --> 48:57.547
Johnny, hey.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.482
Welcome home.

49:00.515 --> 49:02.153
You hungry? You want a drink?

49:02.218 --> 49:04.185
I want a shower.

49:04.219 --> 49:06.322
Some anisette.

49:07.957 --> 49:09.557
A little company first?

49:09.598 --> 49:13.100
- Send them away.
- Scram, girls.

49:13.133 --> 49:15.633
I got the bond as
soon as I could.

49:15.698 --> 49:17.695
100 grand that judge levied.

49:17.728 --> 49:20.400
With fucking child killers
running the streets.

49:20.465 --> 49:22.434
Your pal O'Banion,
on the other hand...

49:22.474 --> 49:24.210
( sniffles ) well...

49:25.506 --> 49:27.102
What about him?

49:27.143 --> 49:29.773
An hour in, they drop
all the charges.

49:29.806 --> 49:32.576
He already signed the
deed over to you.

49:32.617 --> 49:35.314
My second pinch for alcohol.

49:35.355 --> 49:36.921
They're gonna put me away.

49:36.954 --> 49:39.486
The cops knew to be
right there right then.

49:39.519 --> 49:41.023
Ralph: Just like
with our brother.

49:41.056 --> 49:44.529
And just like with Frank,
O'Banion walks away.

49:44.562 --> 49:47.897
A man my age don't
belong in prison.

49:47.930 --> 49:51.692
Away from his home
and from his wife.

49:51.733 --> 49:53.900
A man my age needs to relax.

49:57.070 --> 49:58.974
I'm tired, Al.

49:59.007 --> 50:01.205
Been a long fucking day.

50:01.238 --> 50:03.339
Need a ride home?

50:03.372 --> 50:05.739
- Anything?
- No, I'm good.

50:07.350 --> 50:09.247
Actually,

50:09.280 --> 50:12.780
there is one thing
I'd like you to do.

50:14.715 --> 50:16.880
Kill that Irish fuck.

50:23.495 --> 50:25.930
- ( Waves crashing )
- ( seagulls screeching )

50:25.963 --> 50:28.862
( boat horn blares )

50:32.537 --> 50:34.769
( car approaches )

50:48.484 --> 50:50.986
- Willie.
- Uncle Nucky, I'm sorry.

50:51.019 --> 50:53.991
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you call me?

50:54.024 --> 50:56.657
I just...

50:56.690 --> 50:58.698
couldn't be there anymore.

50:58.731 --> 51:01.560
If you're trying to impress me,
you're off to a very poor start.

51:01.593 --> 51:03.695
This isn't a game, Will.

51:03.728 --> 51:05.496
I need to trust you.

51:05.537 --> 51:08.169
I need men around me who
can keep their wits.

51:08.202 --> 51:10.369
I know.

51:10.409 --> 51:12.470
I can.

51:13.710 --> 51:15.940
I will.

51:15.973 --> 51:18.047
Go home now, get some rest.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.744
Tom will drive you.

51:21.153 --> 51:22.982
He'll be awake.

51:23.015 --> 51:25.147
He'll be drunk.

51:25.220 --> 51:28.020
It'll just upset my mother.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.931
Stay here tonight.

51:36.964 --> 51:39.298
But in the morning
we're going to talk.

52:03.722 --> 52:06.154
Deacon.

52:06.187 --> 52:08.659
Need to talk to you.

52:09.285 --> 52:12.052
Found out who's been running
that poison around here.

52:12.093 --> 52:15.355
I know full well, Mr. Purnsley.

52:15.396 --> 52:17.858
And I'm on my way to see Mr.
White right now.

52:17.931 --> 52:20.128
Deacon, please.

52:20.161 --> 52:22.031
I've seen the error of my ways

52:22.064 --> 52:25.894
and I'm on the path
to righteousness.

52:25.934 --> 52:27.504
Mmm.

52:27.537 --> 52:31.274
A guilty man will say
anything to save his skin.

52:32.738 --> 52:35.342
Pray with me, Deacon.

52:36.239 --> 52:38.046
Please.

52:38.079 --> 52:40.647
Take my hand.

52:46.016 --> 52:47.222
( Blade clicks )

52:47.255 --> 52:49.022
( groaning )

52:51.427 --> 52:54.901
Our Father who art in heaven...

52:54.934 --> 52:58.266
Come on, how did it go?

53:00.905 --> 53:02.906
( Grunts )

53:13.080 --> 53:15.217
Daughter: Dear Lord,

53:15.250 --> 53:19.493
delivered into the hands
of the wicked by a kiss.

53:19.526 --> 53:22.194
Bound like a thief,

53:22.227 --> 53:25.162
abandoned by your disciples...

53:26.364 --> 53:28.667
have mercy on me.

53:49.756 --> 53:51.987
Dear Lord...

53:56.258 --> 53:59.263
dying on the cross in
the presence of Mary,

53:59.296 --> 54:03.465
pierced with a lance that
drew blood from your side,

54:03.498 --> 54:08.565
taken down and placed in the
arms of your sorrowful mother...

54:09.966 --> 54:12.103
have mercy on me.

54:15.606 --> 54:19.410
The flesh withers as
the spirit flourishes.

54:19.443 --> 54:23.010
- I know that's right, Doctor.
- Hmm.

54:24.917 --> 54:27.956
And what did the
spirit divine today?

54:27.989 --> 54:30.787
- Chalky, he's...
- Ahem.

54:30.820 --> 54:33.458
Mr. White.

54:33.491 --> 54:37.797
He doesn't seem pleased to have
to answer to Mr. Thompson.

54:38.999 --> 54:41.100
And you?

54:41.133 --> 54:43.034
Is he pleased with you?

54:44.066 --> 54:46.201
I believe he is.

54:49.415 --> 54:51.815
A babe among the reeds.

54:51.848 --> 54:56.212
Your mother, she
fought the spirit.

54:57.180 --> 54:58.851
She hurt you.

54:58.884 --> 55:01.928
It burned for but an instant.

55:01.961 --> 55:04.462
Her pain is everlasting.

55:14.303 --> 55:18.001
These hands set her free.

55:18.905 --> 55:21.640
And set you on your path.

55:25.715 --> 55:28.011
Yes, Doctor.

55:31.144 --> 55:33.753
You will sing for me now.
