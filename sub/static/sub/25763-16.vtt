23:48.033 --> 23:50.533
Wyoming for Kanye's listening
party.

23:50.533 --> 23:52.567
It was all such a last-minute
thing.

23:52.567 --> 23:57.300
But I feel like, after TMZ,
Kanye's changed his whole album.

23:57.300 --> 24:01.367
And I'm just excited so many
people came out to support.

24:01.367 --> 24:04.667
Kanye is doing press while he's
here in Wyoming, so he's gonna

24:04.667 --> 24:08.667
have a chance to talk to
Charlamagne and just express how

24:08.667 --> 24:12.767
he feels.
So I'm glad that now we can just

24:12.767 --> 24:18.533
have fun and just listen to the
music and have a good time.

Trump," right?

woman named Ms. Alice Johnson.
We have to go meet Ms. Alice

35:41.533 --> 35:45.266
because Mommy and Shawn helped
her get out of jail.

35:45.266 --> 35:50.700
She was in jail for 20, almost
22 years.

So, Alice and I have been
discussing when we're gonna meet

face-to-face.
Like, we have to meet, we have

35:56.533 --> 35:59.667
to connect.
We have to just give each other

35:59.667 --> 36:03.700
a big hug.
Just that video of seeing Alice

36:03.700 --> 36:09.033
run out of prison and get to her
family and hug everyone was just

36:09.033 --> 36:12.700
such a satisfying moment.
Just to know that she's been

she's now home.

36:17.300 --> 36:21.033

I think, honestly, for the first
