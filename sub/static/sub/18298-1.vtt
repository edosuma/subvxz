23:14.494 --> 23:16.827
<i> behind a column
 at the Academic Center.</i>

23:21.667 --> 23:23.667
<i> [gunshot]</i>

23:25.138 --> 23:27.805
<i> And I gave him
 the I-talian digit.</i>

23:31.177 --> 23:32.176
<i> [gunshot]</i>

23:34.514 --> 23:39.417
<i> He fired once at the column
 and hit it.</i>

23:39.419 --> 23:40.751
But he didn't do it again.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.922
<i> I waited until the individual
 started firing</i>

23:44.924 --> 23:46.190
<i> on the east side
 of the Tower--</i>

23:46.192 --> 23:47.191
<i> [gunshot]</i>

23:50.062 --> 23:53.931
<i>And then ran across the street
 into the Tower Building.</i>

23:56.068 --> 23:57.768
<i> [gunshot]</i>

24:03.609 --> 24:05.776
<i> [gunshots]</i>

24:05.778 --> 24:09.547
<i> - You could see the bodies
 lying on the campus.</i>

24:11.551 --> 24:14.151
<i> On the Main Mall.
 [gunshot]</i>

24:14.153 --> 24:17.154
And we knew then
that there was nothing

24:17.156 --> 24:19.156
<i> that could be done
 from that office.</i>

24:19.158 --> 24:22.026
So we were inextricably
drawn closer.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.239
<i> We got up to the statue
 of Jefferson Davis.</i>

24:35.241 --> 24:37.942
<i> People say that that statue
 should be taken down,</i>

24:37.944 --> 24:39.977
<i> that that statue
 has no place being there</i>

24:39.979 --> 24:43.247
because of Jefferson Davis
and all he represents.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.817
<i> But at least on that day,
 it gave me a little shelter.</i>

24:48.654 --> 24:50.654
<i> Across from the Main Mall,
 there was about</i>

24:50.656 --> 24:52.490
<i> a dozen students
 there as well,</i>

24:52.492 --> 24:54.658
<i> all looking
 at the bodies laying there.</i>

24:57.830 --> 25:00.064
<i> And it was frustrating,
 I guess.</i>

25:00.066 --> 25:03.901
<i> Something has to be done,
 but if I go out there?</i>

25:03.903 --> 25:06.704
<i> [gunshot]
I might die.</i>

25:11.711 --> 25:13.744
<i> [camera clicking]</i>

25:16.082 --> 25:18.048
- It was like
a frozen snapshot.

25:18.050 --> 25:21.252
<i> [camera clicks]</i>

25:21.254 --> 25:23.954
<i> Obviously some people
 were still alive</i>

25:23.956 --> 25:27.258
<i> and hiding behind
 small things.</i>

25:27.260 --> 25:30.628
<i> A couple people
 seemed really...dead.</i>

25:31.964 --> 25:33.831
I've never seen a dead body.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.000
<i> I didn't care
 if they bombed the Tower.</i>

25:36.002 --> 25:39.837
I just wanted a plane to come
and take that guy out.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.039
<i>- What else did you see as you
 came through the campus?</i>

25:42.041 --> 25:43.941
Did you see any other
injured persons?

25:43.943 --> 25:46.110
- There's several people laying
out on the Mall at this time.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.945
Three of them may be shot,

25:47.947 --> 25:49.647
<i> and the others may just
 be laying there.</i>

25:49.649 --> 25:51.181
<i> [gunshot]</i>

25:51.183 --> 25:54.251
<i> - A woman was lying
 on her back on the Mall,</i>

25:54.253 --> 25:57.154
and she was
obviously pregnant

25:57.156 --> 26:00.224
<i> and in obvious pain.</i>

26:00.226 --> 26:01.892
It was hard to watch her

26:01.894 --> 26:04.595
<i> and to know that no one
 could get to her</i>

26:04.597 --> 26:06.764
<i> without being shot
 themselves.</i>

26:09.936 --> 26:11.936
<i> - Under the base
 of the Tower,</i>

26:11.938 --> 26:14.104
<i> there were a lot
 of people there.</i>

26:14.106 --> 26:16.941
<i> And they were yelling.</i>

26:16.943 --> 26:18.709
<i> They were saying,</i>

26:18.711 --> 26:21.612
<i> "We've gotta help
 that pregnant woman!"</i>

26:21.614 --> 26:25.115
<i> And then somebody else
 yelled out,</i>

26:25.117 --> 26:28.118
<i>"No, we've gotta help the ones
that there is still hope for."</i>

26:31.791 --> 26:33.123
So I thought...

26:34.627 --> 26:37.127
Well...

26:37.129 --> 26:39.363
I probably wasn't
gonna get help.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.999
- Has any effort been made
to try to get those persons out?

26:42.001 --> 26:43.634
<i> [gunshots]
Another shot. He's still firing</i>

26:43.636 --> 26:45.603
<i> repeatedly from
 the University Tower.</i>

26:48.274 --> 26:50.975
<i> - I was trying to figure out
 what was happening.</i>

26:53.145 --> 26:56.313
I didn't feel pain.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.849
It felt more like
something really heavy

27:03.856 --> 27:06.240
was pressing down on me.

27:06.241 --> 27:08.625
I thought it felt like
an invasion from outer space

27:08.628 --> 27:11.295
<i> because I felt like
 I'd been shot</i>

27:11.297 --> 27:15.299
<i> by some kind
 of antimatter gun.</i>

27:15.301 --> 27:18.002
<i> It felt like that's
 what was happening.</i>

27:19.238 --> 27:22.239
<i> [radio frequencies]</i>

27:25.378 --> 27:28.078
<i> That I was just...dissolving.</i>

27:29.749 --> 27:31.749
<i> [frequencies intensify]</i>

27:35.955 --> 27:37.955
<i> [faint footsteps]</i>

27:45.297 --> 27:50.000
<i> Then at some point
 a girl ran up.</i>

27:50.002 --> 27:52.169
- Please he...
- Are you all right?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.871
<i>Let me help you.
 - She came up</i>

27:53.873 --> 27:56.206
<i> and kind of knelt over me.</i>

27:56.208 --> 28:00.044
<i> And her hair...
 It was red and coming down.</i>

28:00.046 --> 28:03.213
<i> [gunshots]</i>

28:03.215 --> 28:05.883
- Go. Go.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.085
<i> [gunshots]</i>

28:08.087 --> 28:09.319
- Get down.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.735
- What's your name?

28:26.238 --> 28:27.237
- It's Claire.

28:27.239 --> 28:30.074
- Claire?

28:30.076 --> 28:32.076
I'm Rita.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.180
I'm here with you now, okay?

28:40.453 --> 28:42.753
- Her name was Rita.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.091
<i> [gunshot]</i>

28:47.093 --> 28:50.094
<i> - I tried to call
 the store and my wife.</i>

28:50.096 --> 28:52.429
<i> [busy signal]
 [sighs]</i>

28:54.433 --> 28:55.966
<i> The lines were busy.</i>

29:05.311 --> 29:08.011
<i> I saw Officer Day.
 He was alone.</i>

29:08.013 --> 29:10.013
[indistinct chatter]

29:10.015 --> 29:12.015
<i> I went up to him
 and I offered my help to him.</i>

29:12.017 --> 29:13.784
- Let's go this way.
- All right.

29:15.955 --> 29:19.957
<i> - As it went on, I moved
 forward a little bit more.</i>

29:19.959 --> 29:21.425
<i> Kind of inching around,</i>

29:21.427 --> 29:23.160
<i> getting a little bit
 different viewpoint,</i>

29:23.162 --> 29:25.996
<i> that sorta thing,
 as we kept broadcasting.</i>

29:25.998 --> 29:28.465
<i> [gunshots]</i>

29:28.467 --> 29:31.001
<i> I think it's
 kind of a natural instinct.</i>

29:31.003 --> 29:34.171
<i> "Hey, I gotta get closer.
 I gotta see what's going on."</i>

29:34.173 --> 29:37.007
<i>We are not sure that the police
 are returning the fire,</i>

29:37.009 --> 29:39.176
<i> but we do hear the shots
 and we do...</i>

29:39.178 --> 29:41.011
<i> But I wasn't, believe me...
 [gunshot]</i>

29:41.013 --> 29:43.113
I wasn't trying to put myself
in harm's way.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.815
Under the clock
on the south side

29:44.817 --> 29:46.316
of the University
of Texas Tower,

29:46.318 --> 29:48.352
and police
are returning the fire.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.487
<i> [gunshot]
 - I saw this airplane.</i>

29:50.489 --> 29:52.022
<i> circling the tower.</i>

29:52.024 --> 29:54.858
<i> It was a single-engine
 small airplane.</i>

29:54.860 --> 29:57.194
But the drafts
of the heat and the wind,

29:57.196 --> 30:00.531
the airplane just couldn't get
a steady shot of the sniper.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.274
<i> The Austin Police Department,</i>

30:10.276 --> 30:12.276
they didn't have weapons
that would reach

30:12.278 --> 30:14.244
from the ground
to the top of the Tower.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.246
<i> [gunshot]
 - It was like a war.</i>

30:16.248 --> 30:18.048
There were gunshots
coming from everywhere.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.818
<i> - At one point,
 I saw a civilian</i>

30:20.820 --> 30:23.086
<i> carrying a deer rifle
 coming from behind me</i>

30:23.088 --> 30:25.222
<i> and running toward the Tower.</i>

30:25.224 --> 30:27.224
- I don't know where
these vigilantes came from,

30:27.226 --> 30:31.862
<i> but Parlin Hall was filled
 with civilians with huge guns</i>

30:31.864 --> 30:35.065
<i> and they began to shoot back.</i>

30:35.067 --> 30:37.901
There was massive testosterone.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.169
<i> - This was an average citizen</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:40.971
who heard my report
on the radio

30:40.973 --> 30:42.339
and decided to come help.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.843
<i>We didn't know it at the time,</i>

30:45.845 --> 30:49.179
<i> but what was happening
 was my radio broadcast...</i>

30:49.181 --> 30:51.582
<i> The feeds were made
 to the radio networks</i>

30:51.584 --> 30:54.117
<i> and to all the other news
 outlets around the country.</i>

30:56.589 --> 30:59.923
<i> - At approximately 12:15,
 the phones at KTBC</i>

30:59.925 --> 31:02.492
<i> began to ring with requests
 for phone reports</i>

31:02.494 --> 31:06.396
<i> to radio stations all over
 the North American proper.</i>

31:06.398 --> 31:09.032
<i> Reports were recorded
 for radio stations</i>

31:09.034 --> 31:12.369
<i> in Anchorage, Alaska,
 Halifax, Nova Scotia,</i>

31:12.371 --> 31:16.039
<i> San Diego, California,
and even from Honolulu, Hawaii.</i>

31:16.041 --> 31:18.876
<i> - Repeating--A sniper
 with a high-powered rifle</i>

31:18.878 --> 31:20.944
<i> has taken up a position
 on the Tower</i>

31:20.946 --> 31:22.880
<i> at the campus
 at the University of Texas.</i>

31:22.882 --> 31:25.215
<i> - To bring you
a special bulletin from KTBC...</i>

31:25.217 --> 31:27.050
<i> - All over the United States,</i>

31:27.052 --> 31:29.987
<i>radio stations were calling in
 to get a report</i>

31:29.989 --> 31:31.622
<i> of what's going on in Austin.</i>

31:31.624 --> 31:34.324
<i> - You are looking at
 the University of Texas Tower</i>

31:34.326 --> 31:36.994
<i> in Austin live.</i>

31:36.996 --> 31:41.164
<i> There is a sniper
 or more than one sniper</i>

31:41.166 --> 31:44.501
<i> located on that ridge
 right there under the clock.</i>

31:44.503 --> 31:47.537
<i> One boy was shot while
 sitting in the Union</i>

31:47.539 --> 31:49.306
<i> through the window.</i>

31:49.308 --> 31:52.075
<i> Two others have been
 reported shot on the drag,</i>

31:52.077 --> 31:53.410
<i> Guadalupe Street.</i>

31:53.412 --> 31:56.413
<i> There are people hiding
 behind trees</i>

31:56.415 --> 31:59.917
<i> all over the University
 of Texas campus.</i>

31:59.919 --> 32:03.186
<i> Several are pinned down
 behind retaining walls</i>

32:03.188 --> 32:05.923
<i>in front of the main building.</i>

32:05.925 --> 32:07.491
<i> People are warned
 to stay out</i>

32:07.493 --> 32:10.027
<i> of the University
 of Texas area.</i>

32:10.029 --> 32:11.962
<i> This is a live camera,
 coming to you</i>

32:11.964 --> 32:14.464
<i> from KLRN Channel 9.</i>

32:14.466 --> 32:17.601
- I really didn't know
what to expect.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.970
<i> - University Tower
 observation deck...</i>

32:19.972 --> 32:23.006
<i> Below the--Below the clock,
 and is shooting.</i>

32:23.008 --> 32:24.708
<i> He's shooting our direction.</i>

32:24.710 --> 32:26.343
<i> We just saw a puff of smoke,
 he's firing again.</i>

32:26.345 --> 32:28.245
<i> It's a battle now.</i>

32:28.247 --> 32:30.247
<i> It's a battle between
 the sniper and the police.</i>

32:30.249 --> 32:32.249
<i> - I could hear
 all the shooting.</i>

32:32.251 --> 32:34.251
<i> [gunshots]
 [sirens wailing]</i>

32:34.253 --> 32:35.719
<i> Hear the sirens.</i>

32:39.158 --> 32:41.158
<i> I knew it was a disaster,
 so to speak,</i>

32:41.160 --> 32:45.662
<i> because the only ones
 with sirens were ambulances.</i>

32:45.664 --> 32:48.565
<i> [gunshot]</i>

32:48.567 --> 32:52.069
<i> - I saw Officer Martinez
 there at 21st Street.</i>

32:52.071 --> 32:55.572
Martinez!
Hey, Officer!

32:55.574 --> 32:59.576
<i> And I hollered out to him,
 but he didn't hear me.</i>

33:04.984 --> 33:06.416
<i> [gunshot]</i>

33:15.260 --> 33:17.194
<i> - I tried to keep myself
 from being able</i>

33:17.196 --> 33:19.096
<i> to see the top of the Tower</i>

33:19.098 --> 33:23.066
<i> because I knew if I could see
 the top of the Tower,</i>

33:23.068 --> 33:24.468
<i> the sniper could see me.</i>

33:27.773 --> 33:31.641
<i> I ran until I got
 to the South Mall</i>

33:31.643 --> 33:33.543
<i> by the Jefferson Davis
 statue.</i>

33:34.546 --> 33:35.679
<i> [gunshot]</i>

33:37.383 --> 33:40.550
<i> [gunshot]
 There were wounded people...</i>

33:43.055 --> 33:44.721
<i> and dead people,</i>

33:46.725 --> 33:49.426
<i> people whose conditions
 I did not know,</i>

33:49.428 --> 33:51.595
<i> lying there on the sidewalk.
 [gunshot]</i>

33:54.033 --> 33:55.365
<i> [gunshots]</i>

34:01.373 --> 34:04.741
<i> There was a pregnant woman
 that was twisting</i>

34:04.743 --> 34:07.744
<i> and wilting
 in the hot sun.</i>

34:07.746 --> 34:10.112
<i> My training in the army
 had taught me</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:13.250
you establish a command post
right away.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.520
<i> Then your organize
 an assault team.</i>

34:16.522 --> 34:18.522
<i> [gunshot]</i>

34:21.693 --> 34:25.362
<i> I thought maybe I could
 go into the Tower</i>

34:25.364 --> 34:27.531
<i> and assist the people
 that were going there.</i>

34:32.504 --> 34:34.071
<i> [gunshots]</i>

34:39.610 --> 34:42.813
<i> My mission was to get
 into the Tower.</i>

34:45.516 --> 34:47.217
- Don't worry.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.420
- We're gonna be okay.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.155
<i> [gunshots]</i>

34:52.157 --> 34:54.157
- I'm tired.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.793
- Yeah, it won't be
much longer now.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.328
Don't worry.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.098
<i> - We lay there
 and just talked...</i>

35:01.100 --> 35:02.833
<i> [gunshot]</i>

35:02.835 --> 35:06.269
<i> Which was kind of wonderful</i>

35:06.271 --> 35:07.838
<i> because it kept me conscious.</i>

35:09.541 --> 35:11.541
And I don't know
what would've happened

35:11.543 --> 35:15.345
had I been unconscious.

35:15.347 --> 35:19.349
- Where did--Where did you go
to high school, Claire?

35:19.351 --> 35:22.686
<i> - I think we tried to talk
 about who I was</i>

35:22.688 --> 35:25.322
<i> and who Tom was.</i>

35:26.758 --> 35:28.892
- Claire, what classes...

35:28.894 --> 35:31.761
What classes are you
taking this semester?

35:33.432 --> 35:35.599
- I'm taking anthropology...

35:37.903 --> 35:40.904
With Tom.
- Tell me about Tom.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.374
- Tom Eckman.

35:44.376 --> 35:49.379
I met Tom Eckman,
Thomas Frederick Eckman,

35:49.381 --> 35:53.216
when I was beginning
the sixth month of my pregnancy.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.152
<i> - ♪ Yellow is the color ♪</i>

35:55.154 --> 35:58.488
<i> - And I was visibly,

49:29.667 --> 49:33.502
Guess I--Guess I ain't
got much choice now, do I?

49:41.512 --> 49:45.014
<i> - I turned and saw an officer
 I knew, Houston McCoy.</i>

49:45.016 --> 49:49.018
All I had was my .38,
so that--that shotgun

49:49.020 --> 49:51.354
looked pretty beautiful
at that moment.

49:53.358 --> 49:55.157
Get down.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.459
<i> [gunshot]</i>

50:07.472 --> 50:09.205
- The other two officers
went this way.

50:09.207 --> 50:10.373
I'll cover you.
- Got it.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.776
<i> - A picture came to my mind.</i>

50:13.778 --> 50:15.311
My boys and my wife.

50:17.648 --> 50:20.383
<i> And immediately
 it went out of my mind.</i>

50:24.288 --> 50:25.421
I didn't have a fear

50:25.423 --> 50:28.090
of being killed,
I really didn't.

50:28.092 --> 50:31.594
- There was no time
to think about fear.

50:33.331 --> 50:35.798
Now, I'd be a fool
or I'd be a liar

50:35.800 --> 50:39.335
if I were to say
I was not scared.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.437
I was scared.

50:41.439 --> 50:44.440
But you put that behind you.

50:44.442 --> 50:50.112
You cannot have fear in front
of you and do your job.

50:50.114 --> 50:51.614
- I just knew
that I wasn't going to allow

50:51.616 --> 50:53.649
anybody to make me dead.

50:53.651 --> 50:55.751
- I heard the subject
running on the walkway.

50:55.753 --> 50:59.288
I fired one round
in an attempt to stop him.

51:01.626 --> 51:05.428
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry!

51:05.430 --> 51:08.297
I heard him run
the other direction.

51:10.134 --> 51:11.467
<i> - It's going to take longer</i>

51:11.469 --> 51:13.069
to tell you
than it did to do it.

51:14.739 --> 51:16.439
- I emptied my gun.

51:30.288 --> 51:32.455
- There was some firing,

51:32.457 --> 51:34.457
and then it was all over.

51:37.128 --> 51:39.128
<i> [gunshots]</i>

51:56.514 --> 51:58.814
- By the time
I had emptied my pistol...

51:58.816 --> 52:01.217
- By the time
I had emptied my pistol...

52:01.219 --> 52:02.685
- McCoy fired.

52:02.687 --> 52:04.887
- McCoy was pretty close--
I grabbed that shotgun

52:04.889 --> 52:06.889
from McCoy and I shot him

52:06.891 --> 52:09.158
one more time
as he was hitting the ground.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.497
<i> After that was done,</i>

52:14.499 --> 52:18.334
my knees felt like rubber.

52:18.336 --> 52:21.871
I felt like I had been hit
by a sledgehammer.

52:21.873 --> 52:23.772
I mean all my energy left me.

52:23.774 --> 52:28.410
And I was shaking. Rounds,
bullets were still coming up.

52:30.348 --> 52:34.183
And I said I had enough
and I left.

52:34.185 --> 52:35.784
<i> - The campus,
 for all practical purposes,</i>

52:35.786 --> 52:37.453
<i> has been cleared.</i>

52:37.455 --> 52:39.188
<i> Police got to the Tower,
 and are keeping</i>

52:39.190 --> 52:41.357
<i> all the persons
 in the University Tower,</i>

52:41.359 --> 52:42.691
<i> and the main police
 are coming out</i>

52:42.693 --> 52:44.527
<i>and walking across the campus.</i>

52:44.529 --> 52:46.362
<i> The University area
 has been cordoned off.</i>

52:46.364 --> 52:48.531
<i> - I waved my handkerchief
 to stop the firing</i>

52:48.533 --> 52:50.699
<i> from down on the ground.
 [gunshots continue]</i>

52:57.208 --> 52:59.875
- Once that flag waved,
I knew it was over then.

53:02.246 --> 53:05.181
It was bam-bam-bam-bam.
It was just...

53:05.183 --> 53:07.416
'Cause we had--
You had dozens of gunmen

53:07.418 --> 53:09.752
firing at the Tower
from all directions.

53:09.754 --> 53:12.354
<i> And they slowly stopped.</i>

53:12.356 --> 53:13.522
<i> - Ladies and gentlemen,
 we have this word</i>

53:13.524 --> 53:15.257
<i> just into the newsroom.</i>

53:15.259 --> 53:17.593
<i> The sniper has been seen
 waving a white flag</i>

53:17.595 --> 53:19.428
<i> on the west side
 of the building.</i>

53:19.430 --> 53:21.597
<i> According to reports
 just into our newsroom,</i>

53:21.599 --> 53:23.766
<i> the sniper has been seen
 waving a white flag</i>

53:23.768 --> 53:26.769
<i> on the west side
 of the building.</i>

53:26.771 --> 53:29.772
This is Neal Spelce
with a bulletin

53:29.774 --> 53:31.774
from the KTBC Radio newsroom.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.609
The sniper is dead.

53:33.611 --> 53:35.277
<i> This is Neal Spelce
 with a bulletin</i>

53:35.279 --> 53:36.745
<i> from the KTBC Radio newsroom.</i>

53:36.747 --> 53:38.614
<i> The sniper is dead.</i>

53:38.616 --> 53:42.451
<i> The firing has now stopped,
 and the time is 1:23.</i>

53:42.453 --> 53:43.619
<i> [radio shuts off]</i>

53:46.791 --> 53:51.927
When I said, "The sniper
is dead," it was like...

53:51.929 --> 53:55.464
- It was like a big...
[exhales]

53:55.466 --> 53:58.334
Sigh of relief.

53:58.336 --> 54:01.503
The sirens all of a sudden
started getting silent.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.739
The bullets stopped.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.443
<i> And it was quiet.</i>

54:09.447 --> 54:12.481
<i> - Someone waved a flag.</i>

54:12.483 --> 54:16.252
And...I walked around.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.288
<i> There was blood everywhere.</i>

54:22.793 --> 54:25.561
People just surged
out of the building.

54:25.563 --> 54:27.796
- We all walked up the steps.

54:30.434 --> 54:33.002
It seems like
we filled the mall.

54:58.562 --> 55:00.329
<i>- It was a few people at first,</i>

55:00.331 --> 55:01.730
and then dozens,
and then hundreds.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.404
<i> - I don't remember anyone</i>

55:08.406 --> 55:11.607
being articulate
about what had happened.

55:13.444 --> 55:16.945
<i> You know,
 just shock and awe.</i>

55:16.947 --> 55:19.081
Kind of a blankness.

55:23.087 --> 55:25.621
<i> - They looked like
 they were mesmerized.</i>

55:27.958 --> 55:30.092
They-they weren't
hugging each other.

55:30.094 --> 55:34.763
They weren't talking
to each other.

55:34.765 --> 55:38.033
<i> Most of them were
 just kind of milling,</i>

55:38.035 --> 55:41.904
<i> walking around,
 as if dazed and wondering,</i>

55:41.906 --> 55:45.641
"What in the world
has happened to my world?"

55:47.778 --> 55:49.378
<i> [camera clicking]</i>

55:57.388 --> 56:00.556
<i> - They didn't know the names
 of the people who had died.</i>

56:00.558 --> 56:02.591
And we didn't know
what had happened

56:02.593 --> 56:03.992
until later that day.

56:06.564 --> 56:09.932
<i> It was a sad time,
 a very sad time.</i>

56:09.934 --> 56:11.533
Not only for the people
who lost

56:11.535 --> 56:13.402
or were losing
their loved ones,

56:13.404 --> 56:17.873
but for the whole campus,
the whole town, and the state.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.708
- It was not something

56:19.710 --> 56:22.811
you would expect
from our beautiful Tower.

56:27.818 --> 56:30.986
<i> - I just sat there
 and watched people gather.</i>

56:32.790 --> 56:34.656
<i> It was something
 that I had been a part of</i>

56:34.658 --> 56:36.658
<i> for an hour and a half.</i>

56:38.662 --> 56:40.129
<i> It was done for me.</i>

56:40.131 --> 56:42.131
<i> [sirens wailing]</i>

56:44.835 --> 56:46.502
<i> - The Travis County
 Blood Bank</i>

56:46.504 --> 56:48.103
<i> has asked
 to please come immediately.</i>

56:48.105 --> 56:50.973
<i> There is an urgent need
 for these types of blood--</i>

56:50.975 --> 56:52.741
<i> Type O-positive,</i>

56:52.743 --> 56:56.111
<i> Type O-negative,
 Type A-positive.</i>

56:56.113 --> 56:58.814
<i> - I was begging them
 not to cut off my dress</i>

56:58.816 --> 57:02.117
because it was
the first day I'd worn it.

57:02.119 --> 57:06.655
It was my first
and only maternity dress.

57:06.657 --> 57:09.658
<i> It was very beautiful.
Tom had helped me pick it out.</i>

57:12.997 --> 57:15.798
<i> - My dad was working downtown
 in a shoe-repair shop,</i>

57:15.800 --> 57:17.566
<i> and then somebody
 came up to him</i>

57:17.568 --> 57:19.635
<i> and asked him
 if he knew what was going on.</i>

57:19.637 --> 57:22.805
My dad said no.
And the guy said,

57:22.807 --> 57:25.741
"Well, there's been
a lot of shooting going on."

57:25.743 --> 57:27.709
- He said, "Yeah, there's
a lot of shooting going on.

57:27.711 --> 57:29.077
"And, oh, by the way,

57:29.079 --> 57:33.015
your son has been shot
and he was killed."

57:33.017 --> 57:35.551
He went home, picked up my mom,
and the two of 'em

57:35.553 --> 57:37.052
rushed over to the hospital.

57:37.054 --> 57:40.722
He-he did not want
to believe that...

57:40.724 --> 57:43.892
until it was something
that he-he could...

57:43.894 --> 57:45.727
that could be confirmed.

57:45.729 --> 57:50.899
Whereas my mother
was responding...

57:50.901 --> 57:54.603
I guess like a mother.

57:54.605 --> 58:00.776
<i>My parents didn't find out for
several hours that I was okay.</i>

58:00.778 --> 58:02.978
<i> - It's a madhouse here
 at Brackenridge Hospital.</i>

58:02.980 --> 58:05.848
<i> At least 17 persons are here
 undergoing treatment.</i>

58:05.850 --> 58:09.084
<i>We have had unconfirmed reports
 that two persons have died.</i>

58:09.086 --> 58:10.752
<i> We have a list of the names.</i>

58:10.754 --> 58:12.120
<i> These names were
 just given to us</i>

58:12.122 --> 58:14.022
<i> by the hospital
 administrator.</i>

58:14.024 --> 58:16.925
<i> The victims have been
 identified as Oscar Royuela,</i>

58:16.927 --> 58:19.094
<i> Billy Speed, Robert Boyer,</i>

58:19.096 --> 58:22.764
<i> Paul Sonntag,
 Roy Schmidt, Billy Snowden--</i>

58:22.766 --> 58:24.933
<i>- Joe, hold it.
 Hold just a minute.</i>

58:24.935 --> 58:26.602
<i> This is Paul
 over at the newsroom.</i>

58:26.604 --> 58:29.104
<i> What was that list of names
 again, please?</i>

58:29.106 --> 58:30.772
- One of the people
who came rushing

58:30.774 --> 58:35.244
into our newsroom
to help out was Paul Bolton.

58:35.246 --> 58:37.946
<i> He had gone
 into semi-retirement</i>

58:37.948 --> 58:40.249
<i> and I had taken over
 his position</i>

58:40.251 --> 58:42.784
<i> as the television
 news director.</i>

58:42.786 --> 58:45.254
Paul was working there
in the newsroom

58:45.256 --> 58:48.857
when Joe read
the list of names.

58:48.859 --> 58:52.995
And Paul reacted dramatically
at that point.

58:52.997 --> 58:55.297
<i>- Roy Schmidt, Billy Snowden--
- Joe, hold it.</i>

58:55.299 --> 58:56.899
<i> Hold just a minute.</i>

58:56.901 --> 58:58.901
<i> This is Paul
 over at the newsroom.</i>

58:58.903 --> 59:01.069
<i> Everyone is interested
 in that list of names.</i>

59:01.071 --> 59:03.539
<i> I think you have
 my grandson on there.</i>

59:03.541 --> 59:05.541
<i> Go over that list
 of names again, please.</i>

59:05.543 --> 59:06.875
- [sniffling]

59:12.550 --> 59:14.550
"I think you have my..."
[sniffles]

59:18.556 --> 59:22.558
"I think you have
my grandson.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.227
I think you have my grandson
on that list."

59:25.229 --> 59:26.895
Uh...

59:26.897 --> 59:29.565
And Joe said,
"Okay. Okay, I'll do that."

59:29.567 --> 59:31.900
And he went through the--
The list again.

59:31.902 --> 59:38.240
And, yeah, it was his namesake
grandson, Paul Bolton Sonntag.

59:38.242 --> 59:42.578
Didn't know at the time
if he'd been killed,

59:42.580 --> 59:44.079
but he was.

59:44.081 --> 59:48.650
Frankly,
I just broke up now.

59:48.652 --> 59:50.319
I think it's...
[laughs]

59:50.321 --> 59:52.187
I think it's because
I have grandchildren.

59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.063
<i> - I was in intensive care
 for seven weeks.</i>

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:09.071
<i> Rita came to see me
 when I was in the hospital.</i>

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.339
- How are you feeling?

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.880
- I'm...[clears throat]

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.882
I'm, uh...

01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:24.219
I'm doing better now.
- I made you something.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.888
It's nothing much.
I just...

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:30.225
<i> - She came and brought me
 a painting she had done.</i>

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:40.068
I was just, you know,
incredibly touched

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.104
by her bringing that

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:45.273
<i> and, um...I think
 that's the only time</i>

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.876
we saw each other after that.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.115
<i>Only recently I've realized...</i>

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:58.053
<i> How really, amazingly
 brave that was of her.</i>

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:00.222
- Are you all right?
Let me help you.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:04.226
We've heard from all sorts
of people involved in this

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.928
how terrified they were.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.265
<i> And yet she came
 right up to me.</i>

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:13.268
<i> I mean,
 that was very selfless.</i>

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.938
Why did you do that,
you know?

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.940
What gave you the courage

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:21.143
to come out and do that?

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.078
<i> And were you afraid?</i>

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.982
Were you afraid that
you were going to get killed?

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.152
- For a person
to be so giving,

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:33.388
has to go lay down
on hot concrete

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.090
on a 100 degree day.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:37.759
<i> - Somehow, you know,
 that situation</i>

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:40.929
<i> just pulled out
 that hero in her.</i>

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:48.704
<i> - There's a special place
in Heaven for people like that.</i>

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:51.440
She's a wonderful woman.

One of history's

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:32.013
worst mass-murders occurred
here in Austin today.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:36.184
By official count tonight,
49 persons were hit by gunfire.

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:39.187
There are 16 dead
and 33 injured.

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:42.023
It started last night,
when a man reportedly

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.492
killed his wife
and his mother.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:46.027
That same man apparently
rounded up an arsenal

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.196
and supplies this morning
and then went

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:51.366
<i> to the observation deck of
the University of Texas Tower.</i>

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:54.136
It was then that terror
rained down from the Tower.

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:56.271
<i> [gunfire]
 Charles J. Whitman</i>

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.273
<i> was shot down
 on the observation deck</i>

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.275
<i> by two city policemen.</i>

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.445
The policemen were aided
by an Austin man, Allen Crum.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.548
<i> The story of how they ended
 the 90 minutes of terror</i>

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.917
was told this afternoon
at a news conference

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:11.186
held by Austin Police Chief
Bob Miles.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:12.921
- Did you guys shoot
as soon as you saw him?

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:14.489
- Did anybody ask him
to surrender

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.325
or give up or anything
before all the firing started?

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:19.995
- No. As I said
just a moment ago,

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:23.465
<i> Mr. Crum fired one shot
 into the west wall</i>

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.301
When Officer Martinez
looked around the corner,

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.304
Mr. Whitman had his gun
leveled out and ready to shoot.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:35.143
Officer Martinez had no way
of knowing whether Officer Day

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.846
or Mr. Crum
had already come out

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.080
and were in a position
to be shot.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.518
- At the news conference,
of course it was McCoy,

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.521
<i> Jerry Day,
 Allen Crum, and myself.</i>

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.560
- If you don't mind,

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.428
I'll do the talking
for the group.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:57.098
And no. No.
And if I'm wrong,

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.435
Mr. Martinez can stop me
and, uh, correct me on it.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.437
<i> - The reporters
 asked questions</i>

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:05.874
<i> and Chief Miles answered
 all the questions.</i>

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:08.143
<i> We were just there for
 show and tell, so to speak,</i>

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:12.948
because he handled it.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.951
- The man here beside me
is Allen Crum.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:18.320
He was deputized
to go up on the Tower

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:20.989
<i> with the two policemen
 who ended the gun battle.</i>

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.924
- You got me?

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.259
- I got you.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.595
- Mr. Crum, could you
tell us how you happened

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:28.964
to be in the Tower building
in the first place?

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:31.967
- Well I, uh...
[clears throat]

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:33.969
Became involved in this
when I looked out

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:36.571
of the Co-Op window and saw
a boy shot across the street.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.206
I went across the street
to investigate

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.141
because I thought
it was a small fight.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.611
<i>And as I stepped out the door,
 I heard the sound of shots.</i>

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:45.080
- And you actually
went into the Tower?

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:47.482
- Yes, sir. I couldn't
get back across the street

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.484
because of my fear
that I might get shot myself.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:53.889
So I went to the next building,
and the next building.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:55.891
I thought perhaps I could help
them when I got over there

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.893
so I waited 'till he shot
from the other side of the Tower

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.227
<i> and then ran into it myself.</i>

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.562
<i> - Mr. Crum,
 I know that I speak</i>

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:03.899
for all the citizens
of Austin in expressing

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:05.133
our gratitude to you

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:07.369
and to the Austin
police officers

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:10.205
who put an end
to the reign of terror

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:11.539
on the University
of Texas campus.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:14.509
- I've never known
braver men.

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:16.945
<i> Their decisions
 were correct,</i>

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:19.080
<i> timely done,</i>

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:22.417
and accomplished in an honorable
manner.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.253
If I had to do this
over again with these men,

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.122
<i> I certainly would.</i>

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.691
<i> The Chief of Police
 offered me a check</i>

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.359
from the City of Austin

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:34.396
for one day's
deputized citizen's pay.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.566
<i> I refused it, of course.</i>

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.439
<i> - Somehow, we ended up
 out on Airport Boulevard</i>

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:48.510
<i> in a vacant lot
with a case of Lone Star beer.</i>

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:50.512
<i> Took off our weapons,</i>

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:53.181
<i> still dressed in our blues
and everything like that but...</i>

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:57.652
<i> We wasn't policemen no more.</i>

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.728
<i> If I would have just gone in,
 if I had just gone</i>

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.596
<i> right up to that elevator,</i>

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.532
pressed that button
to the top floor...

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:16.271
Gone in and get him done.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:19.274
- Go up and get him done,

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:21.276
then Billy Speed
would still be alive.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.577
- Billy!

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.579
- And a lot of other,
I'm sure, but...

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:30.285
But-but-but...
didn't happen that way.

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:34.189
- [sighs]

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.358
Shoulda-coulda.
[chuckles]

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.995
But I didn't.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.700
- Shoulda, coulda. Shoulda...

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.703
Shoulda, coulda.
But didn't.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:53.742
So...I don't know.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:01.116
<i> - Well, to say it hasn't
 affected me in my life,</i>

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:04.486
it wouldn't be
a truthful statement.

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:07.322
But I have, um...

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:09.324
tried.

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:12.494
I have tried
to just forget it.

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:14.496
<i> I hate to see people
 get hurt.</i>

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:17.165
But, you know,
you have to be realistic

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.134
and know that these things
are gonna happen.

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:22.037
And so you have to have the way
how to cope with it,

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:24.039
how to take care
of the problems.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.579
<i> - If somebody were
 to ask how you feel,</i>

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.448
<i> well...</i>

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:37.652
Well, I'd say no words.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.387
It's something--
I've been asked that before,

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.057
How-how did it
make you feel?

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:44.726
And then I kinda
have to say, "Well...

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:47.562
"How would I describe
the colors of a rainbow

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.532
to a person born blind?"

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:53.068
<i> You can't,
 'cause there ain't no words.</i>

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.237
Uh, I don't know.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:07.449
- This is the shirt
that I was wearing.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:11.619
And I must've weighed
about 90 pounds when...

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.522
When this shooting happened.

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:17.292
See that little tear
right there?

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.294
<i>It's where the bullet
just kinda pew.</i>

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.662
<i> [gunshot]</i>

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.665
This is my cousin,
Lee Zamora.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:26.667
He was with me
when I was riding the bicycle

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:30.638
and delivering newspapers at
the University of Texas Tower.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.142
<i> - I was just thinking,
 you know,</i>

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:37.178
I've never talked to anyone
about this before.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.481
<i> [gunshot]</i>

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:41.349
<i> [gunshot]
And I thought, you know,</i>

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:45.520
maybe it'll help me,
you know, do some good

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:50.492
to sit and talk about it
to someone, you know, for once.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.826
Maybe it's something
I need to do.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:59.134
- If you folks had not
given us this opportunity,

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:03.638
I would not have seen
this cousin of mine. I do now.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.542
Been a long time.
I mean, almost 50 years.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:14.782
- It was just
a whole different world.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:18.720
<i> Nobody ever talked about it.</i>

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:21.221
- I didn't meet Claire

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.858
until, uh, a few months ago.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.595
<i> - I never knew
 who Artly was.</i>

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:31.899
I finally decided maybe he was
just an angel or something.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.876
- I was 17.
I'd never seen death.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.877
I didn't know
anything about guns.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.216
It was nothing but a big,
raw, gaping wound,

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:50.952
you know, in my psyche.
In my memory.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.587
There has been
a passage of time, and...

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:55.823
[stuttering]

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:58.459
It's still raw, but it's not
as raw as it once was.

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:00.795
A lotta times,

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.731
the worst days
of your lives are...

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:07.402
personal and, uh, private.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.404
Maybe that's why I've...
I sort of...

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:12.740
[stutters]

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:14.475
Um, hid it inside.

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:20.348
<i> I feel guilty because
 I didn't go out soon enough.</i>

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.984
- Oh, Artly.
- You know, that you were...

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.686
- Artly.
[laughs]

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.621
- Yeah, it's just--
I think--I think guilt

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:29.457
comes with events like this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:31.559
- Strange guilt.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:39.334
<i> UT was closed for one day.
 That was it.</i>

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.336
<i> They came in
 and cleaned up the blood.</i>

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.244
I think the university
should put up a memorial.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:52.847
There's still lots of family
and lots of friends

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.849
<i> of people that were
 killed and injured.</i>

01:10:56.853 --> 01:11:00.521
- Paul Sonntag,
Claudia Rutt,

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:03.992
Robert Boyer,
Billy Speed,

Karen Griffith,
David Gunby,

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.747
and my baby.

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:33.621
They said I could have babies,
but I never got pregnant.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.458
But I got to adopt my child.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.694
<i> I adopted my child Sirak.</i>

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.696
<i> He was born in Ethiopia</i>

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:44.866
<i> and I adopted him
 when he was four.</i>

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:47.869
<i> And he's now 27.</i>

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:51.372
I mean, Sirak
was a wonderful child.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:53.374
And there are times,
even though

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:55.610
his skin is brown
and mine's white,

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:59.447
there are times when
I absolutely cannot remember

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:02.717
<i> that he didn't
 come out of me.</i>

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:07.722
But the baby...
I-I dreamed about him

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:11.059
from the beginning
and I still have dreams

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:15.063
that I found him
and I have him

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.598
<i> and I'm so happy.</i>

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.069
But then I'd look away
or something and he's gone.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.941
<i> [gunshots]</i>

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.081
<i> - I remember looking
at the Tower, of course, a lot.</i>

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:35.616
And from the Main Mall,
you can see

01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:38.786
there's a biblical line
from the Bible.

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:40.788
<i> "Ye shall know the truth and
the truth shall make you free."</i>

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.623
<i> [gunshot]</i>

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:46.060
I've thought about it.
[sniffles]

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.929
One of the truths I learned...

01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:52.934
