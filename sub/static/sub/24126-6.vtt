WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:28.208
we're so adventurous

00:28.208 --> 00:31.583
and again

00:31.583 --> 00:35.083
and there's nobody home

00:35.083 --> 00:38.500
to count on a friend

00:38.500 --> 00:42.083
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:44.000 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.958
I gotta be there

00:50.708 --> 00:54.958
Winnie the Pooh

01:12.750 --> 01:16.083
Rabbit: They're everywhere!
All around us!

01:17.291 --> 01:18.583
Tigger: It's horibibble!

01:18.583 --> 01:21.000
We're outnumbered
10 gazillion to 1!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.458
Woman: Christopher Robin
what's going on?

01:24.458 --> 01:26.750
It sounds like a war
in there.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.625
Uh-oh. It's Mom.

01:28.625 --> 01:30.458
When I get up there,
young man,

01:30.458 --> 01:32.458
you'd better
have a good story.

01:32.458 --> 01:36.083
Oh, no. How am I going
to explain this mess?

01:36.083 --> 01:40.416
Uh, perhaps if you tell her
what happened to us out there,

01:40.416 --> 01:43.875
she won't mind so much
what happened to you in here.

01:43.875 --> 01:48.125
Of course. She'll shake
her head very sadly

01:48.125 --> 01:53.750
and say "Oh, Christopher Robin,
your poor, poor friends.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.750
"A little mess
like this is nothing

01:55.750 --> 01:58.000
next to what they
went through."

01:58.000 --> 01:59.958
I don't know if it'll work.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.000
Sure it will. Hoo hoo!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.291
I'll give you
every gruesomish detail.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.958
I think I can tell
the story better,

02:06.958 --> 02:08.625
thank you very much.

02:08.625 --> 02:11.166
Storytelling is what
tiggers do best.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.958
I'll tell him.

02:12.958 --> 02:16.750
Um, uh, since the story
did begin with Pooh,

02:16.750 --> 02:18.291
perhaps Pooh should begin.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.375
I would be pleased to.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.583
Ahem.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.583
It all began, you see...

02:25.250 --> 02:26.875
as I was settling down

02:26.875 --> 02:29.416
to a nice after-breakfast
yet before-lunch

02:29.416 --> 02:32.291
and nowhere-near-dinner
smackerel of honey--

02:33.708 --> 02:36.416
...when suddenly
I began to suspect

02:36.416 --> 02:39.333
I had a visitor.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.875
And a rather hungry
visitor at that.

02:51.416 --> 02:52.458
Excuse me.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.625
Oh, bother.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.500
I said, and I began to think.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.416
Perhaps I had better
be more clever

03:05.416 --> 03:08.083
about how I eat my honey
from now on.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.750
But I'm afraid the bee

03:11.750 --> 03:13.291
was a bit more
clever than me.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.000
Oh, bother.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.125
Oh, bother.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.500
It seemed the bee

03:22.500 --> 03:24.458
was eating me out
of house and home.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.250
Ah.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.583
Not to mention honey.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.291
And then I had a thought.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.750
I thought perhaps...

03:34.750 --> 03:37.375
If I eat out
of house and home,

03:37.375 --> 03:39.458
maybe the bee won't bother me.

03:41.458 --> 03:44.500
Piglet: And then is when
Pooh came to my house.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.583
Pooh: And I brought
my honey with me.

03:46.583 --> 03:49.291
The bee could never
possibly find me here.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.458
Unless I left the door open.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.000
Oh, bother.

04:13.458 --> 04:14.583
My house!

04:18.958 --> 04:22.166
There. I did it.

04:22.166 --> 04:25.583
Yes, Pooh.
You certainly did.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.291
Christopher Robin:
What happened next?

04:29.583 --> 04:31.250
Piglet:
We needed to find a home

04:31.250 --> 04:33.291
which the bee
had not yet found.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.000
Tigger:
Take that! And this!

04:35.000 --> 04:36.458
And this and that!

04:39.625 --> 04:42.583
Say, buddy bear, seen any
bouncy, beady-eyed bees

04:42.583 --> 04:44.125
go buzzing by?

04:44.125 --> 04:47.375
Pooh: But Tigger's home
was not that home.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.708
So what did you do then?

04:49.708 --> 04:51.333
Piglet: We decided to try--

04:51.333 --> 04:52.625
Rabbit: My house.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.125
But I certainly didn't
want them there

04:57.125 --> 04:59.125
making my home unlivable

04:59.125 --> 05:02.500
just because of some
silly little bee.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.000
Rabbit: Oh, my.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.250
My home! My beautiful--

05:13.250 --> 05:15.416
Hmm. House guests.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.625
Rabbit: And it was then
that I decided...

05:17.625 --> 05:21.583
There's only one way to get
rid of that nasty little pest.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.250
We're going to war.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.375
Gasp. War.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.833
War?

05:27.833 --> 05:28.875
Heh heh heh heh heh.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.000
War?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.875
War?

05:31.875 --> 05:33.458
War.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.458
We are happy,
peaceful creatures

05:36.458 --> 05:39.708
who have always led
happy, peaceful lives.

05:39.708 --> 05:43.333
And no pipsqueak bee
is going to change that.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.375
Uh, perhaps if we
ask very nicely

05:46.375 --> 05:49.583
"Might you not bother us
so much, if you please,

05:49.583 --> 05:50.833
little bee?"

05:50.833 --> 05:52.416
No, Pooh boy.

05:52.416 --> 05:54.458
I know how stripety
critters think,

05:54.458 --> 05:56.833
and I wouldn't trust them
with the time of day.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.708
Say, what time is it anyway?

06:01.708 --> 06:03.875
Half past a full moon.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.583
Whew. Time flies

06:05.583 --> 06:07.375
when you're going
to war.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.375
Well, better get to work
on my secret weapon.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.125
Oh, what secret
weapon, Gopher?

06:13.125 --> 06:17.583
Eh, can't tell. It's a secret.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.750
Now let's get ready
for that bee.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.500
Rabbit: There were
plans to be planned,

06:24.500 --> 06:25.875
maps to be mapped.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.500
Charts to be charted,

06:27.500 --> 06:29.625
forts to be fortrified.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.875
--
to be beat.

06:32.875 --> 06:36.583
Let no one by unless
they give the password.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.708
Excuse me, Rabbit,
but what is the password?

06:39.708 --> 06:42.166
Ha! Do you think I'm
that easily tricked?

06:42.166 --> 06:45.125
There is no password.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.833
My first task was
teaching the troops

06:47.833 --> 06:49.250
to know their enemy.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.750
And, uh, what is this,
Tigger?

06:52.875 --> 06:54.583
A horsie having a picnic

06:54.583 --> 06:56.708
in the mud on
a Thursday afternoon.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.875
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a bee.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.125
And what is a bee, Piglet?

07:01.125 --> 07:04.333
A very small creature
with wings which likes honey.

07:04.333 --> 07:08.625
No! The enemy.
A bee is the enemy.

07:08.625 --> 07:11.875
And what do we do
if we see a bee, Pooh?

07:11.875 --> 07:14.958
We say "Why, look,
there's a bee."

07:14.958 --> 07:17.458
No, no, no.
We sound the alarm.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.375
Sound the alarm.

07:19.375 --> 07:23.208
Oh. And he seems to have
brought along some friends.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.750
We will not be outdone
by a few silly--

07:28.750 --> 07:30.875
-- bees!

07:30.875 --> 07:34.750
This was it, my moment to
remain calm and take charge.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.166
Bees! Thousands of them!

07:37.166 --> 07:39.125
There was only
supposed to be one!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.625
- Only one!
-

07:40.625 --> 07:42.375
Like a good general,

07:42.375 --> 07:45.000
I ordered my troops
to their post.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.875
Bees! Millions of bees! Aah!

07:47.875 --> 07:49.333
Run for your lives!

07:53.208 --> 07:54.333
Charge!

07:56.291 --> 07:58.000
Remember, troops,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.833
it's more than Pooh's
honey we're defending.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.500
It's our very way of life.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.000
Don't shoot till you see
the yellow of their bellies.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.625
Oh, bother.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.416
Yes, sir.

08:17.416 --> 08:19.708
This baby's
gonna give that bee

08:19.708 --> 08:21.208
a thing or two
to think about.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.833
Are you all right,
Pigalet?

08:48.833 --> 08:52.708
Speak to me.
Say a few syllabibbles.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.583
Oh, d-d-d-d-d--

08:54.583 --> 08:56.208
I had to ask.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.958
Heh heh heh heh.
Almost done now.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.416
I was keeping track
of our front lines

09:02.416 --> 09:05.875
and planning the strategies
for new victories.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.750
Private Pooh has retreated
to the left bunker.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.250
- To the left?
- Right.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.416
To the right?

09:12.416 --> 09:14.125
To the left is right.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.250
Well, if the left is right,
who's left?

09:16.250 --> 09:18.583
Pooh's left back at
the right of the front.

09:18.583 --> 09:21.333
The back of the front
or the right of the left?

09:23.833 --> 09:25.958
King me. Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

09:25.958 --> 09:28.416
One secret weapon coming up.

09:28.416 --> 09:32.625
Heh. Now we're going
to see some real action.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.416
The enemy was closing in.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.833
These were the final moments.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.458
The weight of command
was on my shoulders.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.583
The fate of the Wood
was in my hands.

09:43.583 --> 09:48.083
It was the greatest test
of my leadership abilities.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.000
Faster! Aha! They're coming!

09:52.625 --> 09:54.625
Oh, hurry! Oh, please hurry!

09:54.625 --> 09:58.000
Ready! Aim! Fire!

10:02.000 --> 10:04.583
Is it true, as I've heard,

10:04.583 --> 10:08.125
that what goes up
really must come down?

10:10.833 --> 10:13.125
My leadership
instincts told me

10:13.125 --> 10:15.125
that time had come to...

10:15.125 --> 10:16.166
Retreat!

10:22.166 --> 10:23.833
Christopher Robin:
Then what happened?

10:23.833 --> 10:26.833
That's when I knew
there was no choice.

10:26.833 --> 10:31.166
We were
forced to...surrender.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.166
Pooh: And the bees,
you see,

10:36.166 --> 10:37.708
had the same idea.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.375
You both surrendered?

10:39.375 --> 10:42.875
It seemed to be
the friendly thing to do.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.875
And we decided that,

10:45.875 --> 10:48.166
since together
we had made the mess,

10:48.166 --> 10:50.333
together we should
clean it up.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.000
Mom: Christopher Robin,
I'm coming up there,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.708
and I'd better not
find that room in a mess.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.500
It's not, Mom.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.375
Tell him what
happened next, Pooh.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.333
Then, with everyone so happy

11:03.333 --> 11:04.875
that the war was over,

11:04.875 --> 11:07.208
I suggested we celebrate.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.250
Uh, perhaps with a small
smackerel of honey?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.375
Uh, here we go again.

11:18.875 --> 11:21.000
Rabbit:
To your battle stations!

11:21.000 --> 11:23.583
- Tigger: Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:23.583 --> 11:25.750
Piglet: Oh, dear.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.583
Pooh: Oh, bother.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.958
Mom:
Christopher Robin!

11:47.708 --> 11:51.416
Another smackerel,
if you please.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.708
Thank you very much.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.458
Another honey dream.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.708
They're my favorite.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.458
Oh, bother.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.166
My dream must have had
a midnight snack without me.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.500
I shall just have to eat
an extra-big breakfast

12:10.500 --> 12:11.583
to catch up.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.083
No honey!

12:16.625 --> 12:21.416
A surprise! And just
in time for breakfast.

12:21.416 --> 12:25.250
There's nothing like starting
the day with a happy ending.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.291
This honey
seems a bit bashful.

12:28.291 --> 12:32.583
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

12:32.583 --> 12:36.458
This particular honey appears
to have been collected

12:36.458 --> 12:39.708
by some very sticky bees.

12:39.708 --> 12:43.375
I'm sure it really
wants to come out.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.875
It just needs
a bit of coaxing.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.708
I think I have the upper hand.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.000
Whoo!

12:52.000 --> 12:54.708
Then again, perhaps not.

12:54.708 --> 13:00.458
I think this surprise
is much more surprise
than it is honey.

13:02.750 --> 13:06.458
This certainly is beginning
to be a very strange day.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.583
Oh, my.

13:08.583 --> 13:09.958
Honey!

13:09.958 --> 13:11.833
Lots of honey.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.958
April fool!

13:12.958 --> 13:15.750
No, you're not.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.583
You're Christopher Robin.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.208
Silly old bear.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.750
I mean
it's April Fool's Day.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.500
You know, when everybody gets
fun tricks played on them.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.458
It seems someone has already
started playing them on you.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.208
I'd better get home and see

13:31.208 --> 13:33.583
if there's any April Fool
tricks waiting for me.

13:33.583 --> 13:37.291
Hmm. I wonder
if this April Fool

13:37.291 --> 13:40.083
is someone to be
afraid of or not.

13:40.083 --> 13:44.000
I think I shall have to ask
him right after breakfast.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.708
Or perhaps lunch.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.000
Piglet:
Help! P-P-Pooh!

13:51.000 --> 13:52.708
Oh, my.

13:52.708 --> 13:56.708
That "Help! P-P-Pooh!"

13:56.708 --> 13:58.875
sounded very much
like Piglet.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.375
Oh, dear.

14:11.375 --> 14:14.625
Piglet, you called
for help and for Pooh.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.583
We're here.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.583
Please come in,
Pooh Bear,

14:18.583 --> 14:20.291
if you're sure
you're not a flood.

14:20.291 --> 14:23.208
Are you here, Piglet,

14:23.208 --> 14:24.583
or just your voice?

14:24.583 --> 14:26.375
I'm here, Pooh.

14:26.375 --> 14:30.250
Why are you so very up,
Piglet?

14:30.250 --> 14:33.291
Because down
is so very wet.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.583
Don't I?

14:37.583 --> 14:40.458
But, Pooh, when I
woke up this morning,

14:40.458 --> 14:43.083
I found out that my house
was under water.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.250
Uh, that's funny.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.083
It didn't seem
to be under water

14:47.083 --> 14:48.416
when I came in.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.875
It didn't?

14:50.875 --> 14:53.083
Oh, dear. Look.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.416
Oh, my.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.000
A-And over there.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.583
Why, you're right.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.708
We are under water.

15:01.708 --> 15:04.000
But you came in
from the outside,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.958
and you're not wet.

15:05.958 --> 15:09.291
Perhaps it's not flooding
everywhere outside.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.458
Let's go see.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.583
This outside looks dry.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.458
Are you sure?

15:16.458 --> 15:17.750
Yes, Piglet.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.583
We shall just have to look
for another outside

15:20.583 --> 15:22.166
to find your flood.

15:22.166 --> 15:26.583
Either your flood is
a very dry flood, Piglet,

15:26.583 --> 15:28.458
or it is hiding somewhere.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.833
Oh, Pooh, come back inside
the close the door.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.291
Oh, d-d-dear!

15:34.291 --> 15:36.125
Don't worry, Piglet.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.458
I shouldn't?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.875
Your floods are really tricks.

15:39.875 --> 15:43.000
You see, there is
this April Fool.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.958
He likes to trick you,
and this is his day.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.000
He certainly tricked me.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.291
In fact, it was
all rather scary.

15:51.291 --> 15:54.500
Hmm. I go think we should ask

15:54.500 --> 15:57.458
whether these are
"Thank you very much" tricks

15:57.458 --> 15:59.875
or the "Look out!" kind.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.333
Oh, yes, Pooh, please.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.750
I'd rather not be scared

16:02.750 --> 16:04.875
if it's not
absolutely necessary.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.166
But where will we
find the April Fool?

16:07.166 --> 16:11.458
Now where
would an April Fool
feel most at home?

16:14.125 --> 16:18.000
Rabbit always says foolishness
is what tiggers do best.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.375
Don't worry, Piglet. There's
nothing scary at Tigger's.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.166
Gangway! I've been spotted!

16:27.166 --> 16:29.708
Now there's something
scary at Tigger's.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.000
- Run, Piglet!
- Yipes!

16:33.416 --> 16:35.458
Oh, what happened,
Pooh?

16:36.708 --> 16:38.708
I'll tell you what happened.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.083
It isn't a pretty story.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.500
I bounced out of bed to admire
myself in the mirror--

16:44.500 --> 16:46.416
a good way to start any day--

16:46.416 --> 16:48.583
and gasp, there they were!

16:48.583 --> 16:51.250
The who were-- was?

16:51.250 --> 16:54.000
Spots! My beautiful
stripeties

16:54.000 --> 16:55.875
nowhere to be seen.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.583
How can I be a tigger
without stripes? Hoo hoo.

16:58.583 --> 16:59.875
It's hippoposterous.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.750
Now you'll
have to call me Spot

17:02.750 --> 17:04.333
or-- or Rover--

17:05.500 --> 17:06.958
or Prince.

17:06.958 --> 17:09.458
Oh, the shame of it all.

17:09.458 --> 17:13.000
Excuse me, Tigger--
I mean Prince--

17:13.000 --> 17:15.875
but did you notice that
your spots have a zipper?

17:15.875 --> 17:19.708
Well, hoo hoo hoo,
what do you know? Hoo.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.083
It was only
some cuddly-type PJs.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.500
I knew it all the time.
Hoo hoo.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.583
Then you already know
about the April Fool?

17:28.291 --> 17:30.250
You mean
there's another one?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.958
Yes, Tigger. The one who
left you your surprise.

17:33.958 --> 17:36.000
Oh? Tell me more.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.833
Nobody makes a fool
of me but me.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.708
Rabbit:
Another glorious day

17:40.708 --> 17:43.875
of weeds, watering,
and wheelbarrowing.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.375
Just the sort of day

17:45.375 --> 17:47.166
that makes your vegetables
stand up and--

17:47.166 --> 17:50.125
Aah! Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.083
Oh, my goodness gracious.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.083
I'm a genius.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.125
A gardening giant.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.083
You're a dream come true.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.458
- What? Wait. Stop.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.458
What's going on here?

18:06.458 --> 18:09.416
You bet I want to find
this April Fool guy.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.833
Hoo hoo! I have a few
foolish questions

18:11.833 --> 18:13.333
to pick with him.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.625
I wonder if anyone else
has been tricked.

18:15.625 --> 18:16.583
Rabbit: Help!

18:20.291 --> 18:21.333
Help!

18:23.125 --> 18:26.000
Don't just stand there.
Get me down from here.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.000
- Aah!

18:32.958 --> 18:36.458
Thank you. Now would
someone mind telling me

18:36.458 --> 18:38.958
what's going on
around here?

18:38.958 --> 18:40.750
What I can't understand is,

18:40.750 --> 18:43.375
with all his delivering
of surprises,

18:43.375 --> 18:46.333
why no one has ever seen
this April Fool fellow.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.583
You're right, long ears.

18:48.583 --> 18:52.500
The fool must be
invisibibble.

18:52.500 --> 18:58.166
But, Tigger, if the April Fool
is, um, invisibibble,

18:58.166 --> 19:01.583
how shall we find him to ask
him if he's scary or not?

19:01.583 --> 19:04.416
By being invisibibble
ourselves.

19:04.416 --> 19:05.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

19:10.166 --> 19:13.125
Have we found
the April Fool yet?

19:13.125 --> 19:15.833
The only fool around
here has stripes.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.208
I can't believe Tigger
talked me into this.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.875
Patience, bunny boy.

19:20.875 --> 19:24.708
The only way to outfool a fool
is to fool him.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.458
Oh, dear.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.416
Eeyore.

19:36.083 --> 19:37.583
Hawmp!

19:39.083 --> 19:40.333
Shh!

19:40.333 --> 19:41.750
Piglet:
He'll hear you.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.333
And then
we won't be able

19:43.333 --> 19:44.583
to fool him
anymore.

19:44.583 --> 19:48.166
I guess I'd better
do what they say.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.166
Wouldn't want to get
turned into a stump

19:51.166 --> 19:53.000
like my friends.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.458
We're not really stumps,
Eeyore.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.375
We just have
to pretend to be

19:57.375 --> 20:00.083
until we capture
the invisible April Fool.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.583
Of course.
Just what I thought.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.875
When I pretend
to be a stump,

20:05.875 --> 20:08.583
that's usually the reason.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.750
Now we'll get him.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.416
Even the most
invisibibble fool around

20:15.416 --> 20:17.875
can't escape all those
Tigger-tested traps.

20:17.875 --> 20:21.875
When he tries to play
a trick on our pretend Eeyore,

20:21.875 --> 20:23.166
we'll grab him.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.500
I don't see anything.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.416
Of course not,
little Pigalet. Hoo hoo!

20:28.416 --> 20:29.458
He's invisibibble.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.875
Shh! Here he comes.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.583
If you don't mind
my saying so,

20:39.583 --> 20:41.875
here he is.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.416
- Run!
- Help!

20:43.416 --> 20:44.458
Oh, dear!

20:45.583 --> 20:47.000
Oof!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.458
Hey, what's going on?

20:48.458 --> 20:50.958
Look! It's
Christopher Robin.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.291
Oh, run, Christopher Robin.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.166
Yeah. Save yourself.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.833
Save myself? From who?

20:57.833 --> 21:00.583
There's no time.
You got to beat it, kid.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.625
At least let me help you
get out of that cage first.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.958
No, no.
Don't bother about us.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.166
And you'd better
watch out for--

21:08.166 --> 21:09.583
- Whoa!

21:09.583 --> 21:11.375
Never mind.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.000
Now that we're
all together,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.583
will someone please tell me
who we're so scared of?

21:16.583 --> 21:19.583
The April Fool,
who else?

21:19.583 --> 21:21.583
We're not sure
if his tricks

21:21.583 --> 21:24.125
are supposed to be
scary or nice.

21:24.125 --> 21:29.000
Silly old bear. I was the one
doing the April fooling.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.333
But the tricks weren't
meant to frighten you.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.625
Honey for Pooh,

21:34.625 --> 21:37.208
gentle pets for Piglet...

21:39.500 --> 21:41.708
cuddly pajamas for Tigger,

21:41.708 --> 21:44.375
and a balloon for Rabbit.

21:47.125 --> 21:50.291
But you all played the best
trick of the day on me,

21:50.291 --> 21:52.083
so you're the April Fool.

21:52.083 --> 21:55.833
I never would have
guessed it was us.

21:55.833 --> 21:59.208
Sure. Any fool
could have seen it.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.416
And just in time
for breakfast.

22:01.416 --> 22:04.375
But, Pooh,
it's almost sunset.

22:07.416 --> 22:10.875
I knew it was dinnertime
all along.
