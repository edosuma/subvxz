WEBVTT

00:01.750 --> 00:03.291
Kaz, I have great news.

00:03.375 --> 00:05.208
Tomorrow is the Domain's
annual tournament

00:05.291 --> 00:06.792
for Dance Dance Superhero.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.792
I also have great news.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.250
Simon has grown
a whole inch.

00:15.834 --> 00:17.458
Anyway, the best part is,

00:17.542 --> 00:19.583
I convinced Skylar
to come watch me win.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.875
I can't impress her here
where I'm a normo among superheroes.

00:22.959 --> 00:26.125
But at the tournament, she'll see me
as a dance dance superhero

00:26.208 --> 00:27.375
among normos.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.667
That was actually
really good.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.917
You know, this friendship
isn't gonna work out

00:37.000 --> 00:38.583
if we're both cool.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.375
Gather round.
This is important.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.917
Everyone, drop
what you're doing.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.166
Due to our near disaster
with the Annihilator,

00:51.250 --> 00:54.500
I've devised a plan to
increase the number of superheroes.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.333
I'm lowering
the minimum requirements

00:56.417 --> 00:57.709
to qualify for hero status

00:57.792 --> 01:00.959
from level nine powers
to level six powers.

01:01.041 --> 01:06.208
I'll be holding tryouts to re-evaluate
all your previously undervalued,

01:06.291 --> 01:08.291
mostly pathetic powers.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.917
Which reminds me.
Rodney, can I get a top-off?

01:18.750 --> 01:21.333
Hey, Horace,
can I help judge the tryouts?

01:21.417 --> 01:23.000
Sure.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.375
Your comic book expertise will be useful
in judging superheroes.

01:26.458 --> 01:28.041
What?!

01:28.125 --> 01:31.000
No fair. I would be
way better than Kaz.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.917
I'm great at judging people.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.125
Watch.
You stink!

01:38.375 --> 01:40.041
See, that's the problem, Alan.

01:40.125 --> 01:43.250
You're not a people person.
You're more of an animal person.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.000
That's not true.

01:45.083 --> 01:46.709
-Boo.
-(shrieking)

01:49.583 --> 01:52.083
Wait, Alan,
don't change back yet.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.667
I need milk
for my coffee.

As of today, anyone
with level six powers or higher

02:45.166 --> 02:47.542
will be certified
as a superhero.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.333
Remember, if your only power
is that you look like a lizard,

02:50.417 --> 02:53.542
you probably
won't make the cut.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.625
Okay, who's up first?

02:59.417 --> 03:01.542
You look like
you could be useful.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.375
So, what's your power?

03:03.458 --> 03:04.792
(grunting)

03:07.875 --> 03:09.792
That was surprisingly
dainty.

03:13.709 --> 03:16.875
(music playing)

03:20.667 --> 03:24.041
Dr. Victrola,
nobody listens to vinyl anymore.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.542
Fred, I haven't seen you
in months. How you been?

03:29.625 --> 03:31.625
Great. Then just okay.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.166
Then really good,
then not so good.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.750
Then great again,
then just okay.

03:36.834 --> 03:39.250
And now, pretty good.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.375
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

03:41.458 --> 03:45.625
Whoa! Didn't ask for
your entire life story.

03:46.792 --> 03:49.208
Anyway, I really wanna
be a superhero,

03:49.291 --> 03:51.542
because my current job
of driving that ambulance

03:51.625 --> 03:53.792
was pretty good,
then just okay,

03:53.875 --> 03:56.417
then pretty good again,
and then, not so great.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.291
And now, really boring.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.667
Kind of like that story.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.500
Uh, so, what are
your powers?

04:04.583 --> 04:07.000
I can travel at
the speed of sound...

04:07.083 --> 04:09.667
when I'm skipping,
like this.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.583
(humming)

04:13.792 --> 04:15.583
But much faster.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.125
Yeah, sorry, Fred.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.500
I can't certify you.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.917
Lizard Man,
I see you over there.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.125
The fake mustache
isn't fooling anyone.

04:30.667 --> 04:34.250
Thanks for coming to watch
me win the tournament, Skylar.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.041
I'm just glad to get
out of the Mighty Med.

04:36.125 --> 04:39.458
Horace won't even let me try out
to be a superhero again.

04:39.542 --> 04:40.709
I feel like
such a loser.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.750
You're not a loser.

04:42.834 --> 04:45.667
You're not a winner, but...
you're not a loser.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.542
I am.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.625
Even Lizard Man
is more powerful than me,

04:49.709 --> 04:51.500
and all he can do
is catch flies with his tongue.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.417
I can't even do that. See.

04:58.542 --> 04:59.959
You know what they say.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.709
Don't do that in public,
it's creepy.

05:06.125 --> 05:10.750
Okay, the future champion of
Dance Dance Superhero tournament

05:10.834 --> 05:12.250
has arrived.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.291
Ooh, I can't wait to meet him.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.792
You think he'll
autograph my hands?

05:15.875 --> 05:18.375
That's the only part
of my body I never wash.

05:20.542 --> 05:23.792
First of all,
I'm the future champion,

05:23.875 --> 05:25.125
and secondly...

05:31.291 --> 05:34.208
Anyway, the object
of the game is to fight off

05:34.291 --> 05:36.041
the zombie villains
on the screen

05:36.125 --> 05:38.625
and the more cool
and elaborate your dance moves,

05:38.709 --> 05:40.166
the more points you get.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.709
Watch. I'll do
a practice round.

05:51.792 --> 05:55.083
Wow, you are good.
Can I try?

05:55.166 --> 05:57.458
(laughs)
Sure.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.875
But it's pretty hard,

05:59.959 --> 06:01.583
and it takes a while to get...

06:17.667 --> 06:20.792
I jumped three levels.
Is that good?

06:22.000 --> 06:26.041
Uh, it's pretty good,
but not tournament good.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.166
Connie, you should sign up
for the tournament

06:28.250 --> 06:31.125
because you're not just good,
you're tournament good.

06:32.709 --> 06:34.375
I think I will sign up.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.959
Maybe this is a chance for me
to be good at something,

06:37.041 --> 06:39.083
and to get my competitive
juices flowing again.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.500
Thanks for bringing me here, Oliver.
You are the best.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.834
Except at this game.
She's clearly better.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.583
Look, Connie, I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.458
I mean, you're already
feeling pretty low.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.709
Imagine what would happen
to your self-esteem if you lose.

06:52.792 --> 06:56.041
Oh, she's not going to lose.
You are.

07:02.542 --> 07:04.792
(siren blaring)

07:08.208 --> 07:12.250
I got an injured superhero
needs attention, stat.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.291
Where did
that patient come from?

07:14.375 --> 07:15.792
Brought him in the ambulance.

07:15.875 --> 07:18.375
Amba-lance?
What amba-lance?

07:19.750 --> 07:22.417
Yeah, I can't say amba-lance.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.917
So from now on, let's just
call it the boo-boo car.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.750
-So where is it?
-It's right here.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.125
It's invisible.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.041
You can only see it
with these glasses.

07:32.125 --> 07:36.166
And you can only see these glasses
with these glasses.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.125
I can see those glasses.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.709
Oh.

07:42.875 --> 07:47.083
Wow! That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.625
And it's not just
your average invisible

07:49.709 --> 07:51.625
superhero hospital ambulance...

07:51.709 --> 07:53.917
boo-boo car.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.542
This one can fly 10,000 miles per hour

07:57.625 --> 07:59.583
and go anywhere in the universe.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.291
Except Delaware.
We don't know why.

08:02.375 --> 08:05.000
Dude, you have got to let me
drive this thing.

08:06.333 --> 08:11.500
I suppose I could, if you made me
a level six superhero.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.834
Are you trying to bribe me?

08:13.917 --> 08:18.083
Because if so,
lower your voice.

08:19.417 --> 08:22.208
(deep voice) I suppose I could,

08:22.291 --> 08:26.583
if you make me a level six superhero.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.875
Okay. I could bump you up
to a level six

08:29.959 --> 08:32.375
if you had an additional superpower.

08:32.458 --> 08:36.834
So I'm thinking of an even number
between one and three.

08:40.709 --> 08:42.875
Three.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.208
Sure. Three.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.041
You must have psychic powers.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.417
You are now qualified
to be a superhero.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.792
Thank you.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.709
And here are the keys.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.959
Are they invisible?

09:00.041 --> 09:02.875
No. I just forgot
to let go of them.

09:08.041 --> 09:12.083
So, I heard you made Fred a superhero.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.291
-Who did you hear that from?
-From you.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.625
I was standing over there, lurking.

09:16.709 --> 09:18.083
This is where
I come to lurk.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.583
It's my lurk spot.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.250
Anyway, I'm going to tell
my Uncle Horace about this.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.375
-Unless...
-What do you want, Alan?

09:26.458 --> 09:28.250
I wanna ride in
the ambulance with you,

09:28.333 --> 09:30.041
because I love pushing buttons,

09:30.125 --> 09:32.834
and I bet this ambulance
has many, many buttons.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.250
So can I come with you?

09:35.333 --> 09:37.041
Fine. Just don't
do anything weird.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.500
Got it.
Boop!

09:40.583 --> 09:43.041
Don't touch my belly button.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.291
Sorry. I told you,
I love pushing buttons.

09:53.333 --> 09:58.250
Welcome to the Domain's
annual to-the-death blood battle.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.875
Whoops, that's tomorrow's event.

10:03.125 --> 10:08.125
Welcome to the Domain's annual
Dance Dance Superhero tournament.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.375
For our first match,

10:12.458 --> 10:17.166
Oliver will be taking on...
Connie!

10:21.500 --> 10:26.208
Uh, listen, Connie,
maybe you should sit this one out.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.291
I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

10:28.375 --> 10:32.000
That's sweet, but I think our friendship
is strong enough

10:32.083 --> 10:34.750
to survive me completely crushing you.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.333
You are doing down!

10:38.667 --> 10:41.625
Now, before we start,
let's go over the rules,

10:41.709 --> 10:44.667
because they're
pretty confusing.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.959
Highest score wins.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.083
I want a good, clean fight.

10:51.166 --> 10:55.083
No biting, no tickling,
and no dancing below the belt.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.000
How can we not dance
below our belts

10:58.083 --> 11:01.125
when our legs are below our belts?

11:01.208 --> 11:02.542
Easy.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.959
Now they're above my belt.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.250
Any other rules you wanna whine about?

11:22.208 --> 11:23.625
This is so cool.

11:23.709 --> 11:26.250
We can go anywhere
we want in the universe.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.458
Where should we go?

11:27.542 --> 11:28.917
How about Antarctica?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.417
Antarctica isn't even a real place.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.959
We should go to Never Never Land.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.208
-(alarm sounding)
-Uh-oh.

11:37.291 --> 11:39.250
Superhero Gravitas has been injured

11:39.333 --> 11:42.083
by the villain the Ambusher
in a South American rainforest.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.834
-We better find Fred.
-There's no time.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.375
Gravitas needs help now.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.417
Starting engine.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.041
Seriously? You know how much
I love pushing buttons.

11:53.959 --> 11:55.667
Stop with the belly button.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.959
Initiating geo-satellite.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.166
Activating auto pilot.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.959
Opening garage door.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.250
All right, now.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.500
Let's see how fast
this thing goes...

12:12.583 --> 12:14.583
(both yelling)

12:28.875 --> 12:31.917
-That was awesome.
-That was nauseating.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.625
Okay, there's Gravitas.

12:35.709 --> 12:39.250
Now, be careful, and watch out for...

12:41.500 --> 12:45.041
I was gonna say mosquitoes,
but this is much worse.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.500
I am the Ambusher.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.000
Welcome to your final resting place.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.041
Cool. Because I could
really use a nap.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.417
Excuse me.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.583
How am I supposed
to sleep like this?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.375
Ambusher, why are you
in a rainforest?

13:05.458 --> 13:08.834
There are so many more people
in the cities to ambush.

13:08.917 --> 13:12.208
I feel like I'm telling you
how to do your job.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.625
I'm creating a serum that will wipe out
every plant in this rainforest,

13:16.709 --> 13:19.834
and once the governments of Earth
see my power,

13:19.917 --> 13:22.458
they will bow down to me.
(laughs)

13:23.750 --> 13:26.083
(phone rings)

13:26.166 --> 13:28.583
Oh, it's my wife.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.000
She thinks I went to the market.

13:30.083 --> 13:33.000
(ringing continues)

13:33.083 --> 13:35.291
Alan, use your telekinesis
to hit him with something.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.250
I can't touch my hands to my head,

13:37.333 --> 13:38.959
or my fingers to your belly button.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.959
And it's right there, taunting me.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.125
Well, maybe someone
will notice that we're missing,

13:46.208 --> 13:48.417
and send a superhero to save us.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.375
Oh, geez.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.542
Who are you?

13:55.625 --> 13:59.083
I am... the Skipper.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.417
A superhero,
here to rescue these boys.

14:10.959 --> 14:14.000
Wow. How did you
become a superhero?

14:14.083 --> 14:17.667
I bribed that teenager
with an invisible boo-boo car.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.250
This is really bad.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.166
At first, it was pretty good.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.792
Then it was kinda bad,

14:25.875 --> 14:28.041
and then, not so bad at all.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.792
And now, it's pretty terrible.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.375
It's gonna get really terrible.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.667
Once I finish my serum,

14:36.750 --> 14:39.709
I'll destroy the rainforest,
and you with it.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.542
Hey.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.375
This vine is stretching.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.166
Must be from a rubber tree.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.333
Maybe I can stretch far enough
to get my phone off that rock.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.208
Whoa!
Got it.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.959
Are you texting someone
to come and help us?

15:03.041 --> 15:06.041
Yeah, in a minute. First, let me finish
this game of Bricklayer.

15:22.125 --> 15:26.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
did you see that?

15:26.542 --> 15:31.000
Because I didn't. I was
playing Bricklayer against Kaz.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.834
You okay, Oliver?

15:32.917 --> 15:35.083
You look a little
out of breath.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.917
(panting)
I'm fine.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.375
Let's see you
beat that, Con...

15:43.291 --> 15:45.750
...nie.

15:45.834 --> 15:49.583
Well, you better take
your "for sale" sign down,

15:49.667 --> 15:51.333
because you're about
to get rented.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.875
Owned.

15:56.959 --> 15:59.333
You're about
to get owned.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.125
-(music stops)
-What happened?

16:12.208 --> 16:14.208
I have no idea.

16:14.291 --> 16:17.500
The game must have
shorted out.

16:17.583 --> 16:18.583
Why did this
have to happen?

16:18.667 --> 16:22.417
Why, dance gods?
Why must you forsake us?

16:22.500 --> 16:25.709
No problem.
You just kicked the plug out of the wall.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.291
(music resumes)

16:34.417 --> 16:36.375
Connie, you can't go.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.458
Give it up, Oliver.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.333
You're not gonna
stop me from playing.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.959
Look, I just got a text from Kaz.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.542
We have to get
the wormhole transporter,

16:43.625 --> 16:47.458
go to the rainforest, and save Kaz, Alan
and Fred from the villain, the Ambusher.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.166
You go.
I'm staying here.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.333
What? Why?

16:52.417 --> 16:56.041
Because out there,
I'm a former superhero without powers.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.250
In here, playing this game,

16:58.333 --> 16:59.834
I'm finally good
at something again.

16:59.917 --> 17:03.709
Look, Skylar, you don't need this stupid
game to feel good about yourself.

17:03.792 --> 17:08.000
Even without powers,
you're the greatest hero I know.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.417
Kaz needs you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.291
Gus.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.041
I'm withdrawing from the tournament.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.542
I have more important things to do.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.166
So do I.

17:25.083 --> 17:29.125
But for the record,
she forfeits, I win.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.875
Nobody beats me
at this game. Nobody.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.375
My serum is finished.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.291
We can say good-bye to the rainforest.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.834
Are you one of those kooks
who thinks he can talk to plants?

17:42.917 --> 17:44.250
'Cause so am I.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.500
What are you doing here?
Oh, never mind. I'll just destroy you.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.792
I don't know how we're gonna beat him
without powers.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.208
But we do have a power.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.375
The power of dance.

18:09.417 --> 18:11.000
Oh, geez.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.208
Okay. I have an idea.
I just need the key to the boo-boo car.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.834
Whoa!

18:48.041 --> 18:50.041
All right, one of these buttons must...

18:50.125 --> 18:51.291
(yelling)

18:51.375 --> 18:53.417
(thud)

18:53.500 --> 18:55.125
...open the door.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.041
Thanks.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.083
Man, that was a near disaster.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.625
I really learned my lesson.

19:18.709 --> 19:21.083
Never take a bribe
to certify a superhero?

19:21.166 --> 19:24.166
No. Always wear a protective cup
over my belly button

19:24.250 --> 19:25.792
when I'm around Alan.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.458
Boop.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.375
Right now, let's get in
the invisible boo-boo car

19:36.458 --> 19:38.333
and get back to Mighty Med.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.917
Wait. I feel like we're
forgetting something.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.875
Oh, right.
The severely injured superhero.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.750
Horace, what's wrong
with Nurse Gladys?

19:53.834 --> 19:56.792
Her new superhero name
is Lady Spectrum.

19:56.875 --> 20:01.041
And while her power to create rainbows
makes everyone smile with delight,

20:01.125 --> 20:03.417
it wasn't very effective
against the Harpooner.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.750
Look, Horace, you have to
make Skylar a superhero again.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.667
She just defeated
the Ambusher,

20:10.750 --> 20:13.417
and she's way more qualified
than any of these new heroes.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.792
No offense,
Thermometer Man.

20:20.208 --> 20:24.333
Well, I guess I could
bump her up to level six.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.750
Congratulations, Skylar.
You're a superhero again.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.583
-Really?
-(phone rings)

20:28.667 --> 20:31.250
Oh, sorry.
I have to take this call.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.166
-This is amazing news.
-I know.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.250
And it wouldn't have happened
without your help.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.041
You really impressed me today.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.041
Nice moves out there.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.667
Cha-cha-cha.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.166
I really regret doing that.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.083
And I really regret seeing it.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.750
But at least I'm
a superhero again.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.166
-Skylar, you're not a superhero again.
-What?

20:55.250 --> 20:56.625
That was Dr. Bridges.

20:56.709 --> 20:59.291
We have to cancel
our new classification system.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.792
It turns out that Lady Spectrum

21:00.875 --> 21:03.458
was not the only new hero
to lose their first fight.

21:03.542 --> 21:04.875
What other hero lost?

21:04.959 --> 21:07.000
All of 'em.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.250
Including Dr. Frankel,

21:09.333 --> 21:12.000
whose only power
is to manipulate sound.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.667
(high-pitched voice)
I'm sorry, Skylar,

21:13.750 --> 21:16.125
but you can't qualify
as a superhero now.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.458
Will you stop it, Dr. Frankel?
It's not funny.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.417
Ugh, this is
the worst day ever.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.542
Oh. Now it's not so bad.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.458
(theme music playing)
