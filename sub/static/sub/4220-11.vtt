WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.002
Kelly really brings
out the worst in you.

00:03.087 --> 00:05.463
What brings out the worst
in me is you telling
Mills you don't know

00:05.547 --> 00:06.589
if you want to be with me.

00:06.674 --> 00:10.677
I'm trying to be a lieutenant,
and your fiance, and you
can't respect either one.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.804
Request permission to
leave shift, Lieutenant.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.890
I got a little boy.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.350
The baby's turning blue.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.060
Wallace, what's going on?

00:19.144 --> 00:21.688
Anthony Lullo was waiting for
me outside this morning.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.439
I know you tried
to save my son.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.858
I regret my behavior
the other day.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.610
What's that?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.405
Mills? Brett?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.076
Halstead.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.619
Thanks for coming.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.455
Good to have someone
we can trust on this.
Absolutely.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.749
Still no word from
your paramedics?
No.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.584
Dumb question, anybody
try their cells?

00:43.669 --> 00:44.711
Yeah. No answer.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.129
All right. Give me
their numbers.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.340
I'm gonna get an order
and start pinging 'em.
All right.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.720
Were they dispatched
to this location?

00:53.804 --> 00:54.846
Yeah.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.640
This could have been a setup.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.978
Lullo's gotta be
behind this, right?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.815
Yeah. I think we got to
start with that assumption.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.736
What the hell happened here?

01:12.531 --> 01:14.407
He's passed out
from blood loss.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.200
Let's get him
to Chicago Med.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.082
What's that?

01:26.462 --> 01:28.963
Hey, guys, we got a
medical emergency here.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.298
We need you to
move the vehicle.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.342
Hands in the air, keep
your mouths shut.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.011
Whoa!

01:35.053 --> 01:37.555
Turn around !
Keep it down.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.183
Put your hands behind
your back, and no one
gets hurt.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.645
This guy needs to
get to the hospital !
Brett, Brett.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.105
What is this?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.356
Ugh !

01:47.441 --> 01:48.775
Don't hurt her, please.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.693
Doesn't have to be messy.
Just do what we say.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.488
Just let her go!
I'm the one that
he wants, come on !

01:53.572 --> 01:55.656
"He?" Who's "he?"

01:55.741 --> 01:57.575
Where are we going?

01:57.701 --> 02:00.995
Brett, don't get
in that car.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.373
I will blow your head
clean off! Get in !

02:18.514 --> 02:20.890
Where are you
taking us?
Shut up.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.142
Where's your phone, hon?

02:23.227 --> 02:25.144
Left-hand jacket pocket.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.079
Turn around !

02:47.459 --> 02:51.337
Jason Lullo, he, he sustained
fatal injuries long before
we arrived on the scene.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.506
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.882
Just keep quiet, huh?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.467
At least let her go.
I was the one. . .

02:56.552 --> 02:58.177
Shut your hole!

03:03.433 --> 03:04.934
You going to kill us?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.936
You know everything,
is that it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.067
Brett.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.235
Quiet!

03:14.862 --> 03:16.028
Brett, brace yourself.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.440
Okay, thanks.
Let us know.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.318
They pulled footage off
some CPD pods,

03:55.402 --> 03:57.904
and ID'd a black town car
that was following the ambo,

03:57.988 --> 03:59.822
but the plate was obscured.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.658
Hey, guys. Any sign
of Mills and Brett?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.619
Cruz is giving us updates on
the search,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.120
but nothing concrete yet.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.457
Cruz is with the cops?
Yeah. He refused to
come back with us.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.792
This whole thing has got
him really spun out.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.502
How's baby Boden doing?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.008
What does that mean?

04:20.886 --> 04:24.513
Um, baby's still not
absorbing oxygen.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.766
Doctors are working
on him.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.935
Boden, I don't know,
he's holding it together,

04:29.019 --> 04:30.978
but you could tell
he's worried.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.689
Ah, I gotta call him,
see what's going on.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.483
Does he know about
Mills and Brett?

04:35.567 --> 04:38.152
No, I didn't think
he needed to worry
about that right now.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.696
All right, good.
Let's keep it that way.
Alright.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.462
Christopher.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.008
Don't leave him hanging.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.885
He'll be worried.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.893
Herrmann?

05:11.436 --> 05:13.062
How is everybody?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.398
Uh. . .

05:16.733 --> 05:17.817
Yeah.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.820
Severide said there might
be some kind of. . .

05:21.738 --> 05:23.239
Problem?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.533
It's little Terrence.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.827
His lungs ain't working right.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.704
Doctors are all over it,

05:29.788 --> 05:32.957
so, they don't seem
too worried.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.751
It's just. . .

05:37.879 --> 05:39.755
It's hard waiting, you know?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.923
Yeah.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.300
I get it. Um. . .

05:43.593 --> 05:45.761
Listen is there anybody
there with you?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.431
Not yet, but it's okay.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.392
All the same, I'm going to
send, uh, Cindy over there.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.936
Hang in there, buddy.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.896
Yeah. Thanks, Herrmann.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.064
Um. . .

05:57.149 --> 05:59.275
How's everybody over there?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.777
Uh, good, you know.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.280
Everybody's good.
Don't worry about us.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.823
Uh, I'm gonna go.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.450
Give my love to Donna.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.118
Yeah, I will.

06:11.329 --> 06:15.166
Has anybody looped in Dawson?
No, no.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.709
I can.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.252
I got it.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.889
Finally.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.432
Gabby, listen.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.309
Mills and Brett are missing.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.479
What do you mean, missing?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.315
They went on a call hours
ago and never came back.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.025
We found the ambo
and their victim,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.902
but no paramedics.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.905
It's looking like a
pretty scary situation.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.656
Lullo.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.910
We don't know anything yet.
I'll let you know as soon as
we do.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.080
Okay. Thank you, Matt.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.082
Okay.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.586
What the hell am
I doing here?

07:02.631 --> 07:04.757
All we know is
about six hours ago,

07:04.841 --> 07:07.968
cameras caught a black
town car driving like
crazy down Fillmore,

07:08.053 --> 07:11.472
they lost sight of it, so
we're searching for it now.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.890
Whoa. . .

07:12.974 --> 07:14.892
What's this?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.145
Uh, hey, Otis, let me
give you a call back, okay?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.450
Oh, damn !

07:31.535 --> 07:33.577
Hey, hey, hey! Shh.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.469
This is Detective Halstead
of Intelligence.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.888
I need to run an
Illinois passenger tag.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.516
2-5-3-1, William, Nora, Sam.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.726
All right.
Hey, what do you got?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.020
Nothing. Car's empty.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.398
Looks like everybody
made it out.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.650
Thank you.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.654
Car was reported
stolen yesterday.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.036
This happened hours ago.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.872
If Lullo's got them,
they're dead !

08:17.956 --> 08:19.748
Don't assume anything.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.877
Where the hell have they
been all this time?

08:35.473 --> 08:38.142
Hematoma's recollecting.
I thought you fixed him !

08:38.226 --> 08:40.060
He needs medical attention.
Isn't that your job?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.353
We're paramedics,
not doctors.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.897
You need to get
him to an ER.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.691
This is your fault anyway,
that smart-ass stunt.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.277
Fix him, or I'll put
a bullet in your head.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.157
This lump on your
buddy's neck is due to
internal bleeding.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.909
As it grows, it
presses on his trachea,

08:54.993 --> 08:57.953
and that's what's causing
the difficulty in breathing.
It's only gonna get worse.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.497
So cut it open again.
That's only a temporary fix.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.250
Look, you're gonna die unless
get this bleed tied off.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.169
You need to get
to the hospital !

09:05.253 --> 09:07.588
We might as well waltz
into a police station.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.382
No hospitals.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.597
Don't answer it, not if
we're giving him bad news.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.276
Can't you guys tie
off the bleed?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.903
No.
Maybe.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.155
What? Mills,
that's surgery.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.990
Look, if we do this,

09:35.283 --> 09:37.243
will you let us go?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.792
Okay, deal.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.423
No. We are just paramedics,
all we have is
a first aid kit. . .

09:51.508 --> 09:53.884
All we do is make an
incision and clamp
the bleed.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.262
It's not going to be
pretty, but it's going
to save his life.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.017
Yeah. We know.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.436
It's under control.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.647
No way he lets us go.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.024
He's not in charge.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.902
You are?

10:11.987 --> 10:13.028
Right?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.531
I just want to
get out of here.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.957
Well? We have a deal?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.669
No.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.713
Yeah.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.798
We have a deal.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.555
Whoa!

10:44.060 --> 10:46.145
Reporting for duty,
Lieutenant.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.897
I actually took 81
out of service.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.650
Because I left you
shorthanded?

10:51.735 --> 10:54.028
It's not just you,
it's this whole mess.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.780
Plus I sent Herrmann to the
hospital to be with Boden.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.241
Why, what's wrong with Boden?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.328
Uh. . . Donna went into labor,

11:02.412 --> 11:04.913
The baby's in
critical condition.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.126
Oh no.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.420
What about, uh,
Brett and Mills?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.922
We think they were
inside this mess.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.592
The trunk's clear.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.762
Jay.
Hey, Gabby.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.389
You gotta find 'em.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.351
We're trying.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.603
Hey, guys.
I got some blood here!

11:32.817 --> 11:34.693
All right, at least one
occupant is injured.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.029
Maybe they didn't get too far.
Come here, come here.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.990
I want a tight perimeter,
I want a K-9 unit.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.993
And I want a door-to-door
search of the entire
neighborhood.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.205
If you see anything you
think might be out of place,
I want to hear about it.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.797
All right.
Let me have the knife.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.552
Hey!

12:00.637 --> 12:02.262
You better set the gun aside.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.565
This is going to hurt.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.567
Like, a lot. Okay?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.987
I'll go quick.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.495
Aw, hell. . .

12:27.705 --> 12:29.498
That was the easy part.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.257
Hey, what happened?

12:39.509 --> 12:40.717
What'd you do?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.595
It's okay, he just passed out.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.521
Clamp it here.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.575
You do realize what
that'll do?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.637
It's called an ECMO machine.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.348
It's drawing blood from
Terrence's carotid artery,

13:28.433 --> 13:32.102
oxygenating it, and then
putting it back in through
a vein in his leg.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.564
So, basically it's
breathing for him?
Exactly.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.900
It's doing the work of his
lungs so they can heal.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.818
When can we see him?

13:39.903 --> 13:43.238
We're still pretty busy in
there, adjusting his
anticoagulant dosage. . .

13:43.865 --> 13:45.491
Don't let us hold you up.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.119
Look, I won't lie to you,
he's in a tough spot.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.080
But we're doing everything
we can for him.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.250
Thank you, doctor.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.840
Sounds like he's got
a real good chance.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.927
My boy's a fighter,
that much I know.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.015
Hey.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.683
Everything okay?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.478
You keep looking at your
phone every six seconds
since you got here.

14:14.604 --> 14:18.190
You just got here.
Oh, um, just keeping in
touch with the firehouse.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.608
Why, what's wrong?

14:20.276 --> 14:24.738
Chief, you need to worry
about one thing and one
thing only right now,

14:24.822 --> 14:26.281
little Terrence.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.741
Herrmann,

14:28.493 --> 14:30.452
don't keep anything from me.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.664
Not right now. Because
I will not handle it well.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.795
We don't know where
Mills and Brett are.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.840
We found the ambo abandoned
in an alley a few hours ago.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.718
But the cops are on it.
So are Casey and Severide.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.013
There's nothing
for you to do!

14:50.098 --> 14:52.099
So I didn't want to say
anything, all right?

14:58.815 --> 15:01.108
What exactly should
we be looking for?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.651
I don't know, anything.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.695
Blood, broken glass maybe,

15:04.779 --> 15:06.863
if they decided
to steal a car.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.491
- Hey!
- What's up?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.078
Alcohol prep pad.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.663
Same kind we use?

15:15.707 --> 15:17.291
Brett's crazy about these,

15:17.375 --> 15:20.002
she stuffs them in her
pockets before every call.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.632
Casey, we got something.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.093
On our way.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.938
What's the hold up?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.857
We, we're getting there.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.119
Why so quiet?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.332
We, we're just
clamping it off now.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.393
All right.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.146
You're going to need to find
someone to suture him up,

16:21.230 --> 16:23.065
but he's gonna live.
Good.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.442
You, come here.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.319
No, hey!
I need her!

16:27.403 --> 16:28.987
What are you doing?
We have a deal !

16:29.072 --> 16:31.114
I'm gonna make sure
he's okay first.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.203
Hey, yeah, you're all right.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.288
There! He's okay!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.499
We'll see.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.300
Hey, got another one.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.304
Okay, shh.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.681
I need you guys to get
back behind the door.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.766
Get back behind the door.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.438
The deal was, we fix
him up and you let us leave!

17:03.523 --> 17:05.065
I know what the deal was!

17:05.149 --> 17:06.191
Then honor it!

17:06.275 --> 17:07.275
We gotta go now!

17:08.027 --> 17:11.321
They're inside, the door's
bolted. Can you get us in?

17:11.406 --> 17:13.073
Severide, where are you guys?

17:13.157 --> 17:14.574
On our way.

17:14.659 --> 17:18.328
Vic, you said
you'd reign in your partner,
so how about it?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.663
Will you shut up?

17:19.747 --> 17:21.790
I knew we couldn't
trust you two.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.508
Drop the gun !

17:33.970 --> 17:35.679
I said drop it!

18:00.788 --> 18:01.747
We're trapped !

18:14.844 --> 18:15.844
Stay.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.640
Door!

18:21.684 --> 18:22.851
Ready?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.603
Strike!

18:25.897 --> 18:27.105
Strike!

18:36.783 --> 18:39.826
Chicago PD! Don't move!
Drop your weapon !

18:39.911 --> 18:41.244
Do it! Do it now!

18:42.038 --> 18:44.748
Get on the ground, put your
hands above your head.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.042
Mills! Brett!

18:48.878 --> 18:50.045
Yeah ! In here!

18:50.129 --> 18:52.339
Anyone hurt?
No, we're okay.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.550
Sylvie. . .

19:01.057 --> 19:03.391
Boy, is it good
to see you two.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.160
Uh, I'll let Boden
know we're here.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.837
Listen, about the other night.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.923
I really did have to charge
my phone, nothing happened.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.845
I know.
I mean, I believe you.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.640
So, can we talk?

19:46.644 --> 19:47.644
We will.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.983
Hey! There he is!

19:53.067 --> 19:54.943
Big daddy Boden !

19:57.113 --> 19:58.280
Hey.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.615
Where's Mills and Brett?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.033
Oh, they're tied up.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.454
I mean, not literally,
of course, not anymore.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.081
They're at Chicago PD.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.375
What's the latest
with Terrence?

20:11.502 --> 20:15.297
Ah. . . Still on the machine.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.718
Okay.
Yeah.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.053
Hey, uh. . .

20:22.138 --> 20:25.765
You want to hear how Dawson
found Brett and Mills?

20:30.521 --> 20:32.981
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.404
We have numerous witnesses
saying they saw you make

20:39.488 --> 20:42.073
a serious threat
against Peter Mills.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.701
My son was dead.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.745
I was upset.

20:46.829 --> 20:50.498
Yeah, that certainly
squares with the eye
witness statements.

20:50.583 --> 20:55.629
"Mr. Lullo was livid,
full of rage, frothing
at the mouth. . ."

20:56.672 --> 21:02.010
Look, I went over there and
I apologized to Peter Mills
and he accepted my apology.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.387
He's a good kid.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.724
So. . .

21:07.808 --> 21:09.434
You no longer blame Mills

21:09.518 --> 21:11.269
for the death of your son?

21:12.355 --> 21:14.731
I don't understand
what's going on here.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.442
I thought you caught the men
that took those paramedics.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.445
We caught two of them.
Yeah. So far.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.364
And you think it
goes deeper?

21:23.199 --> 21:25.075
Always does, you know?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.493
It's like an iceberg.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.455
You know, I don't want to tell
you how to do your job here,

21:30.539 --> 21:33.083
but shouldn't you be talking
to the guys you caught

21:33.167 --> 21:35.085
and find out what they know?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.925
They're keeping their
mouths shut, aren't they?

21:49.725 --> 21:52.602
What's going on in there?
He's walking all over you.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.063
Maybe I should smack him
around a little bit?

21:55.147 --> 21:56.940
Mills, he's here on
his own volition.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.192
We don't have
anything on him.
Those guys had a cell phone.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.319
They had to be
calling somebody!
Yeah, a pay-as-you-go phone!

22:01.404 --> 22:03.989
It was registered to
Johnny Cash in the middle
of the Indiana sand dunes.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.282
Well if I could just talk
to the older guy, Vic,

22:06.367 --> 22:08.159
the guy that we saved. . .
I already told you,

22:08.244 --> 22:09.828
he refuses to see you.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.665
If you visit that guy in
the lockup, he could get
branded a snitch.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.334
A guy like that, he's
gonna gladly do hard time

22:16.419 --> 22:17.836
before he rats on someone
of Lullo's stature.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.047
So we can't do anything?
We will handle it from here.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.274
Did they get him?
No. Son of a bitch
is going to walk.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.319
Hey, Brett, you okay?

22:43.404 --> 22:44.654
I'm fine.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.586
Hey, is everything okay
between you and Mills?

23:03.174 --> 23:04.507
What's that?

23:07.053 --> 23:10.889
During the helicopter crash,
I rescued this sketchy guy.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.062
What is he, like
a handyman or something?

23:17.772 --> 23:19.564
No, he's no handyman.

23:21.567 --> 23:25.195
He had a gun, and a bunch
of fake IDs and passports.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.032
I want to see if he can
help us take down Lullo.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.076
This guy? How's he
supposed to help?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.202
Let's find out.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.330
Can I borrow your phone?

23:35.623 --> 23:37.290
Those guys threw
mine out the window.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.875
You are not calling
this guy, Sylvie.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.420
Let the cops do their thing.
The cops can't do anything !

23:42.505 --> 23:43.755
But maybe we can !

23:43.839 --> 23:45.465
Look, I get it
that you're upset,

23:45.549 --> 23:47.425
but this is not the way that
you wanna go about this. . .

23:47.510 --> 23:49.594
Those guys were
gonna kill us!

23:49.678 --> 23:51.638
I had a gun to my
head all that time,

23:51.722 --> 23:54.682
hours and hours just
waiting to die.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.602
Anthony Lullo is not going
to get away with that.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.356
Now, can I borrow
your phone, or not?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.737
You do not agree to see
this guy unless I'm there.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.739
Okay?

24:12.535 --> 24:13.952
Thank you.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.044
I'd much rather
not make a connecting
flight with an infant.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.678
Look, Dad, I'm
gonna have to run.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.681
Yeah, no, no, no,
we'll talk later.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.141
Love you too.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.645
What, are you
booking a vacation?

24:41.522 --> 24:42.689
My dad.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.442
He wants to fly us down,
soon as the baby can travel.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.946
You haven't told him
what's going on?

24:52.992 --> 24:56.452
Well, I guess I haven't
conveyed the full gravity
of the situation.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.913
I keep hoping things will
improve, you know?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.042
I don't wanna worry him.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.215
Now he's gonna book us a
trip that we may never take.

25:18.809 --> 25:22.645
There's no question that
Lullo is the one behind
this attempt on our lives,

25:23.022 --> 25:25.773
but the cops have no way
of connecting him to it.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.026
He's just going to
get away scot-free.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.444
Sounds like it.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.530
Well, you, you
know people, right?

25:32.615 --> 25:33.907
Criminals?

25:34.783 --> 25:37.285
So maybe you could ask around,

25:37.369 --> 25:39.704
see if anybody heard
anything about Lullo putting
a price on our head,

25:39.788 --> 25:41.456
I don't know?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.791
Look, I know Lullo
is a powerful man,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.543
but you said if I got
into any kind of trouble,

25:45.628 --> 25:47.045
that you could help me.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.297
So you're calling
in your chit?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.591
My, my what?

25:53.802 --> 25:55.261
Yeah, I am.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.646
I'll see what I can do.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.741
Anything new about the baby?

26:17.534 --> 26:18.743
No change.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.123
I can't imagine what Donna
and Boden are going through.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.419
I'm heading back in
the morning, if you want
to come with me.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.423
Matt. . .

26:39.848 --> 26:41.057
Gabby,

26:43.018 --> 26:44.560
we can work it out.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.604
I don't know.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.775
I shouldn't have walked
off shift like that.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.361
That was crazy, and
completely unprofessional,

26:53.696 --> 26:56.823
and I abandoned two
of our own when
they needed us the most.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.283
You didn't know that.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.285
Besides, I gave you
permission to leave.

27:00.369 --> 27:03.079
You shouldn't have.
That's the point.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.164
It all worked out.
You came back.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.792
Hell, you're the one who
found Mills and Brett!

27:07.876 --> 27:11.587
It doesn't change the fact
that the thing we swore
would never happen, happened.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.256
Our relationship got
in the way of the job

27:13.340 --> 27:14.799
and the job in the way
of the relationship.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.052
I mean, we don't,
we don't even talk
about stuff anymore,

27:18.470 --> 27:20.346
and I feel like we can't.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.102
So you're leaving?

27:29.148 --> 27:33.901
I just think we need some
space from each other.

27:34.778 --> 27:39.115
Maybe that's the only
way we can figure this
whole thing out.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.247
Sounds like you've
made up your mind.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.555
I just thought, as
your friend and roomie,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.225
you could have told me
you and Brett were a thing.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.893
I didn't want to
speak too soon, okay.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.561
We're still dipping
our toes in the water.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.188
And how's the water?

28:54.108 --> 28:55.483
I'm optimistic.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.653
Hey, she finally moved out
of that Pilsen hell-hole,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.279
found a sweet pad
in Wicker Park.

29:00.364 --> 29:04.409
Plenty of room for us to
lay around on lazy Sundays,
drink coffee. . .

29:04.493 --> 29:05.493
Nice.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.579
Hey.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.166
Can you believe Dawson
and Casey split up?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.502
Yeah, I don't know
how real that is.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.796
I think it's real.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.925
I just offered to let Dawson
move in with me in the new
apartment and she said yes.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.802
Hey!

29:26.348 --> 29:28.433
Hey, so, guess what?

29:28.517 --> 29:31.227
Uh, Vic, the goon, is
willing to see you.

29:31.854 --> 29:32.979
What?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.647
How did you do that?

29:34.731 --> 29:37.316
You can see him in
the jail infirmary first
thing in the morning.

29:37.401 --> 29:40.069
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Um, I'll be there.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.197
Wait, really, how
did you do that?

29:44.199 --> 29:45.992
Really, don't
worry about it.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.039
It just sucks, you know?

29:52.374 --> 29:53.958
But it's better to
pull the ripcord now

29:54.042 --> 29:57.044
while we can still
salvage a professional
relationship.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.756
Dawson, I don't like
to get in the middle
of these things,

30:00.841 --> 30:03.301
but you sound like
someone who's trying
to convince herself

30:03.385 --> 30:04.760
that she made the right call.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.308
I'm not deluding
myself, Herrmann.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.393
This is obviously
the right thing to do.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.813
Otherwise, wouldn't Casey
have said something?

30:15.898 --> 30:18.774
Wouldn't he have stopped me
from walking out the door?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.155
It's just the way
it's gotta be.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.289
Wow, what happened here?

30:33.790 --> 30:35.249
I had an accident.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.838
You need to talk to her.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.507
I did talk to her.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.091
Right before she walked out.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.513
You need to put up
a fight, Casey.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.389
You could have stopped her.

30:50.474 --> 30:51.974
Yeah, I could've.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.852
But our situation
was too hard on her.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.855
It couldn't have been easy
for her to make this decision.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.775
It wouldn't be fair for
me to hold her back.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.320
And this is fair for you?

31:11.495 --> 31:12.954
How's everybody
hanging in there?

31:13.038 --> 31:15.915
Hey. Uh, we're getting by,

31:15.999 --> 31:18.125
Christopher,
we're getting by.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.211
I just came by
to pick up Cindy.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.757
You two get some rest.
I'll come back
again tomorrow.

31:24.841 --> 31:25.883
Thank you for everything.

31:25.968 --> 31:26.968
Thank you.

31:30.389 --> 31:35.101
Folks, we have started to
wean little Terrence off
the ECMO unit,

31:35.185 --> 31:37.812
and it does look like his
lungs are improving.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.981
So, he's out of the woods?

31:40.691 --> 31:43.150
It means his lungs
are recovering.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.654
But, once he's off the machine
and no longer sedated,

31:46.738 --> 31:49.865
we are going to have
to monitor him for
neurological deficits.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.993
He was oxygen-deprived
for quite a while.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.787
You're talking
about brain damage.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.207
We just have to wait and see.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.939
Right in there.
No contact, please.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.065
Sure, thanks.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.698
Not sure why you
changed your mind.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.368
Look, I agreed to talk to
you, but I'm not gonna
help you.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.370
I don't care who
your friends are.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.584
How's your neck?

32:41.668 --> 32:45.129
The doc says you did good
work, given what you had.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.008
He also says I'm
very trusting.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.721
One false move,
you could have given
me a massive stroke.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.891
Yeah well, that's my job.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.644
To help people, not hurt them.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.731
You know, I tried to help
Anthony Lullo's son, but
he was beyond help.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.733
I don't know anyone
named Lullo.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.526
That's what
the cops are saying,

33:07.611 --> 33:09.779
that you have no prior
connection to him.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.282
Why would you be
willing to pay hard
time on his behalf?

33:13.367 --> 33:16.327
Look, kid,

33:19.081 --> 33:21.082
hypothetically speaking,

33:22.125 --> 33:25.670
let's say I talk, and
Lullo gets locked up.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.755
You think that's
the end of it?

33:29.549 --> 33:32.843
You think he can't reach
you from behind bars?

33:34.638 --> 33:36.180
A guy like that?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.848
So, you do know him.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.435
You better leave.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.481
Look, if Lullo shares
the blame, why don't you let
him share his punishment?

33:45.565 --> 33:48.401
Guard ! This man's
bothering me.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.111
Okay, that's enough.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.363
You think this is honorable
what you're doing, it isn't.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.365
Okay, I saved your life.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.909
What has Lullo ever
done for you? Huh?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.207
Oh, sorry, you go ahead. . .

34:03.291 --> 34:05.251
Please, this is
already my second cup.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.673
What happened there?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.466
Oh, I had an accident.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.637
Did you see him?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.557
Yeah, not that
it did any good.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.186
Sylvie, sweetheart,
a patrolman dropped
this off for you.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.480
Found it searching your
ambulance the other day.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.565
Oh, thanks.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.899
Totally forgot about that.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.026
You never got a
chance to open it.

34:31.111 --> 34:32.820
Yeah.

34:40.662 --> 34:41.996
Hmm.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.914
Got it for the dashboard.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.001
Why a hula dancing shark?

34:47.836 --> 34:49.754
Guess I thought it'd
make you smile.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.800
Look, I know that you're
mad at me for saving that
creep's life, but I. . .

34:54.885 --> 34:57.470
I'm not, I'm not mad at you.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.974
Then why can't you
look me in the eye?

35:03.894 --> 35:06.145
Because of what you
must think of me.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.524
I asked you to let a man die.
That's messed up.

35:11.193 --> 35:12.735
Those guys were
going to kill us.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.280
Well you knew that, and
you didn't let it cloud
your moral judgment.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.616
I mean, I'm a first responder.

35:18.700 --> 35:22.536
A thought like that is never
supposed to enter my mind.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.748
You wouldn't be human
if it didn't.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.712
I gave you the chance to
clamp off that carotid,
and you didn't take it.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.380
That's all that matters.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.472
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3,
Cool sharky.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.641
Ambulance 61. Structure Fire.

35:55.445 --> 35:58.405
Oh, brother.
Storage units are the pits.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.990
Because of all the locks?

36:00.075 --> 36:02.326
Yep, you gotta bust into
each unit and worse,

36:02.410 --> 36:04.620
you got no idea what you're
gonna find behind each door.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.206
There's smoke up on
the second floor.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.749
I have no clue where
it's coming from.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.168
Let's knock this thing
down before it spreads.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.711
Cruz, get the saw.
Right.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.797
Everyone else, silver bullets.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.718
Spread out and
find the source.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.262
All right, check for heat!

36:27.018 --> 36:28.769
Yow! All right, we found it!

36:28.895 --> 36:30.437
Cruz, get us in.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:57.132 --> 36:59.508
Hey! Propane tank! Get back!

37:04.848 --> 37:08.809
Hey! This place could
blow any second, get
back, all of you !

37:08.894 --> 37:10.352
Everybody fall back!

37:13.815 --> 37:16.233
Wait. He's going to
need water. Let's go.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.487
Go!

37:37.881 --> 37:39.757
You're a madman, Severide.

37:39.841 --> 37:40.925
Nice work, everyone.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.384
Hardly any damage.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.388
Hey. How'd that fire start?

37:46.473 --> 37:49.683
Find out when we overhaul.
Good hustle in there.

37:50.644 --> 37:51.977
Thanks.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.021
See?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.773
It's much simpler,
isn't it?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.858
Lieutenant. Candidate.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.903
We know where we
stand with each other.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.866
This is going to work, Matt.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.035
Lieutenant.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.663
You think so?

38:12.540 --> 38:13.874
Don't you?

38:16.044 --> 38:17.628
I guess, yeah.

38:21.049 --> 38:25.219
Okay, well, gather
up our tools.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.437
It's Halstead.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.231
Hey, what's up?

38:41.403 --> 38:42.403
What?

38:43.238 --> 38:44.571
Okay.

38:47.617 --> 38:50.911
Vic agreed to talk.
They just arrested Lullo.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.207
How'd you do that?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.545
I just got you in the door.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.380
You did the rest.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.430
Okay, who wants to
be the first to hold
Terrence Boden?

39:10.598 --> 39:12.725
Oh, my God.

39:12.809 --> 39:15.227
Would you look at this
sweetness? Oh, my God.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.021
He's off the machine?

39:17.105 --> 39:18.480
And breathing normally,

39:18.565 --> 39:21.900
and preliminary neurological
tests reveal no deficits.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.695
That's very welcome news.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.574
We're going to have to monitor
him for a long time on that,
but I'm hopeful.

39:28.658 --> 39:29.950
Then so am I.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.121
Hey, little man. Oh boy. . .

39:35.498 --> 39:40.461
Hey, little man.
Hey, little man.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.716
Okay, okay.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.259
You going to share the baby?

39:49.304 --> 39:51.138
Aw. Oh, hi.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.015
Here you go.
Hi.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.600
There's your momma.

39:54.684 --> 39:55.726
Hi.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.361
Is that
my beautiful grandson?

40:12.619 --> 40:13.619
Dad?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.127
Say, hello.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.682
Looks like this pile of
boxes knocked this can over.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.560
Vegetable oil seeped
into the rags.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.270
You get how that
works, Dawson?

40:40.355 --> 40:42.940
If cotton or linen
come into contact
with vegetable oil,

40:43.024 --> 40:44.566
bacteria decomposes
the fabric.

40:44.651 --> 40:47.402
And if the heat
can't escape, you get
spontaneous combustion.

40:47.487 --> 40:48.695
Correct.

40:49.072 --> 40:53.283
Whole boxes of brake fluid,
dozen bags of cat litter,
chlorine powder.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.745
It's not what most people
keep in their storage lockers.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.706
This looks like the
stockpile of an arsonist.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.293
All right, we'll get A.I.
in here to have a look.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.878
Hey, guys?

41:20.812 --> 41:22.271
What the hell?
