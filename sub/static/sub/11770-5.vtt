WE'RE GONNA MEET SOME FRIENDS
AND HAVE DINNER.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.367
JUST FRIENDS.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.967
OKAY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY
IN YOUR LIFE THERE.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.633
I MEANT, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN GENERAL ?

00:52.667 --> 00:54.100
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

00:54.133 --> 00:56.833
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M INVESTING IN A RESTAURANT ?

00:56.867 --> 00:57.933
WHAT ARE YOU TOUCHING ?
NO REASON TO TOUCH.

00:57.967 --> 01:00.067
OH, I'M SORRY, DID I
OVERSTEP MY BOUNDARY ?

01:00.067 --> 01:01.200
NO TOUCHING HERE.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.533
DO YOU NEED THE MONEY
FOR THE RESTAURANT ?

01:02.567 --> 01:04.267
NO, I JUST THINK IT WILL BE
A FUN THING TO DO, YOU KNOW,

01:04.300 --> 01:06.133
SHOWING PEOPLE
TO THEIR TABLE.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.233
SO, YOU'LL BE WORKING THERE,
YOU'LL BE LIKE, A BUS BOY ?

01:08.267 --> 01:09.267
NO, REMEMBER WHEN
WE USED TO HANG OUT

01:09.300 --> 01:12.367
IN THE COMEDY CLUBS
IN NEW YORK ?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.067
BUT I DIDN'T INVEST,
I JUST WENT THERE AND I LEFT.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.767
I DIDN'T LOCK UP.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.067
ARE YOU GONNA LOCK UP
THE RESTAURANT ?

01:17.100 --> 01:18.533
I'M NOT GONNA
LOCK UP.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.700
ALRIGHT, SEE YOU THERE,
ROCCO.

01:20.733 --> 01:23.300
I WENT WITH ROCCO.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.067
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:24.067 --> 01:24.867
NICE TO SEE YOU.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.633
GOODNIGHT, PAUL,
SEE YOU LATER.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.833
LARRY, YOU ARE
SO RUDE.

01:32.867 --> 01:33.833
WHY ?

01:33.867 --> 01:36.733
YOU DIDN'T SAY
ONE WORD TO MINDY.

01:36.767 --> 01:41.433
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LOOK IN HER
DIRECTION THE WHOLE TIME.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.767
DID YOU SAY
ANYTHING TO HER ?

01:45.867 --> 01:47.800
YOU DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.067
I SAID HELLO,
DIDN'T I ?

01:50.067 --> 01:52.100
I DON'T THINK
YOU DID, HONESTLY.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.067
NO.
I DIDN'T SAY HELLO ?

01:55.067 --> 01:56.067
NO, I SAID HELLO.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.700
I DON'T THINK YOU DID,
ACTUALLY.

01:57.733 --> 02:00.700
THINK YOU WERE VERY
CAUGHT UP IN PAUL.

02:00.733 --> 02:03.600
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK OVER AT HER.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.933
OH, SHE MUST THINK
I'M SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.900
YEAH.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.200
DID YOU EVEN
NOTICE HER ?

02:10.233 --> 02:12.067
WELL, I MEAN,
I SMELLED HER PERFUME.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.700
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD
NOT TO NOTICE.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.700
WELL, SHE OWNS
A PERFUME SHOP.

02:15.733 --> 02:20.200
OH, THE WHOLE NIGHT IS JUST,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.667
BYE, BYE.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.633
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WAVE
GOOD-BYE OR ANYTHING.

02:27.667 --> 02:30.967
OH, BY THE WAY,
WHEN THE CHECK COMES TONIGHT,

02:31.067 --> 02:33.967
STU CAN PICK IT UP,
OKAY ?

02:34.067 --> 02:34.867
DON'T PICK UP
THE CHECK.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.067
YEAH, I PAID
THE LAST TWO TIMES...

02:36.067 --> 02:37.333
YOU HAVE.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.333
HE RUNS TO THE BATHROOM,
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT ?

02:39.367 --> 02:40.333
EVERY TIME
THE CHECK COMES.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.067
I'VE NOTICED
THE BATHROOM TRICK.

02:42.067 --> 02:42.967
YEAH, HE'S REALLY GOT
THAT BATHROOM TRICK DOWN.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.333
HE REALLY DOES.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.267
HI.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.733
LATE, LATE.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.700
HI, NO, YOU'RE NOT LATE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.967
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:51.067 --> 02:53.467
WE WOULD'VE BEEN HERE
10 MINUTES EARLIER

02:53.500 --> 02:55.633
IF WE JUST
VALET THE CAR

02:55.667 --> 02:56.933
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO FIND A PARKING SPACE.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.567
PLEASE, I'M NOT GONNA
VALET THE CAR.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.867
I GOT THIS BRAND NEW
CADILLAC CTS.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.300
DRIVES LIKE A DREAM.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.700
I'M GONNA GIVE IT
TO THE FREAKING VALET ?

03:03.733 --> 03:05.300
YEAH, NO,
IT'S OUR THIRD CHILD.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.067
DID YOU HAPPEN TO RUN
INTO THE REISERS OUTSIDE ?

03:08.067 --> 03:10.367
WE SAW THEM, BUT WE,
YOU KNOW, NO EYE CONTACT.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.067
NO, THEY DIDN'T,
THEY DIDN'T SEE US.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.500
SO, I GUESS
THEY'RE NOT INVITED

03:14.533 --> 03:16.733
TO THE NRDC BENEFIT
AT YOUR HOUSE ?

03:16.767 --> 03:18.100
UM, NO.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.533
NO, NO, I DON'T THINK IT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA, DO YOU ?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.533
AH, IT JUST FELT LIKE
IT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.633
IT IS SO GENEROUS OF YOU GUYS TO
OPEN YOUR HOUSE TO THIS BENEFIT.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.433
AND YOUR HEARTS.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.633
IT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING.

03:27.667 --> 03:28.900
IT IS A BIG
UNDERTAKING.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.900
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, I GET
TO HAVE ALANIS MORRISSETTE

03:31.933 --> 03:33.133
SINGING IN
MY LIVING ROOM.

03:33.167 --> 03:33.867
I CANNOT WAIT.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.133
I THINK
SHE'S FANTASTIC.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.167
THAT FIRST ALBUM,
THE SONG "YOU OUGHT TO KNOW".

03:37.200 --> 03:39.833
YEAH, RIGHT, AND SHE'S REFERRING
TO THIS MR. DUPLICITY...

03:39.867 --> 03:41.767
LARRY HAS NO IDEA WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.067
OH, WHEN YOU SAID
MR. DUPLICITY,

03:43.067 --> 03:45.867
I NATURALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE
REFERRING TO ME, BUT I...

03:45.900 --> 03:48.533
AND YOU KNOW WHO IT'S ABOUT,
HER GUITAR PLAYER.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.067
NO, IT'S A BIG SECRET.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.267
SHE'S NEVER SAID,
SHE HAS NEVER,
SHE'S NEVER SAID.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.300
IT WAS AN ACTOR IN A SITCOM
ABOUT THE FAMILY.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.100
OH, YEAH,
OR HER MANAGER.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.067
I THINK I'VE
HEARD HER MANAGER.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.167
BUT IT'S
THIS HUGE SECRET.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.233
SHE'LL TELL ME,
PEOPLE CONFIDE IN ME.

04:01.267 --> 04:02.667
SHE'LL OPEN UP
TO YOU, LARRY.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.067
THEY DO, EVERYBODY
OPENS UP TO ME.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.067
I'LL FIND OUT.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.533
I'M GONNA FIND OUT
THE BIG SECRET.

04:06.567 --> 04:07.467
OKAY, GOOD.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.267
SO, YOUR PARENTS
ARE OUT HERE NOW.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.700
YEAH, YEAH,

04:10.733 --> 04:13.067
HOW'S YOUR MOM ?

04:13.067 --> 04:14.967
AH, YOU KNOW, SO SO.

04:15.067 --> 04:15.900

04:15.933 --> 04:17.500

04:17.533 --> 04:18.700
I COULD, YEAH.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.700
OH, THAT WAS GOOD.

04:20.733 --> 04:21.967
THAT WAS GREAT.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.067
OH, IT'S OFFICIAL,
I'M NOW FULL.

04:24.067 --> 04:26.133
NOW YOU ARE.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.833
THE FAT BOY'S SPECIAL.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.933
YOU'RE DONE ?

04:28.967 --> 04:30.300
I'M GONNA GO TO
THE LITTLE BOY'S ROOM.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.633
THE LITTLE
FAT BOY'S ROOM.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.067
I KNOW, OKAY.

04:33.067 --> 04:35.900
NO, IT'S
THE FAT BOYS SPECIAL.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.333
LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.133
HE KNOWS.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.633
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.100
IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.467
AND SO WE PROBABLY
WON'T SEE EACH OTHER 'TIL...

04:57.500 --> 04:59.133

05:04.567 --> 05:07.200

05:07.233 --> 05:08.700
WELL, LAST NIGHT WAS IT,

05:08.733 --> 05:11.800
ALRIGHT,
I'M GOING OUT.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.167
ALRIGHT.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.533
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT MINDY REISER ?

05:14.567 --> 05:15.600
I WISH THERE

05:15.633 --> 05:17.100
I COULD MAKE IT UP
TO HER, YOU KNOW ?

05:17.133 --> 05:19.933
I COULD'VE AT LEAST ASKED HER
ABOUT THE PERFUME STORE.

05:19.967 --> 05:20.967
PEOPLE LOVE
WHEN YOU ASK THEM

05:21.067 --> 05:22.333
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
YOU KNOW ?

05:22.367 --> 05:23.467

05:23.500 --> 05:25.200
YEAH, NEXT TIME YOU SEE HER
JUST BE NICE TO HER.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.467
AH, SHE THINKS I'M
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST SCHMUCK.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.800
HEY, LAR.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.600

05:37.533 --> 05:39.433
UH, YEAH, AND NO.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.233
BUT I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

05:41.267 --> 05:43.767
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET OVER HERE TOO.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.700
OH, MY GOD,

05:45.733 --> 05:48.067
IT'S BIG.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.067
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

05:50.067 --> 05:51.867
OKAY.

05:51.900 --> 05:55.233
MY BROTHER, HIS BEST FRIEND
WORKS FOR THE C.I.A.

05:55.267 --> 05:59.100
AND HE GOT THIS INFORMATION FROM
THE HIGHEST SOURCE POSSIBLE,

05:59.133 --> 06:01.867
THAT THERE IS GOING
TO BE A TERRORIST ATTACK

06:01.900 --> 06:04.467
THIS WEEKEND IN L.A.

06:04.500 --> 06:10.200
YEAH, AND YOU CANNOT
TELL A SOUL.

06:10.233 --> 06:13.067
MY BROTHER TOLD ME, BUT I'M
NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL ANYBODY.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.800
BUT YOU KNOW, I HAD TO,
YOU MY GIRL, I HAD TO TELL YOU.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.067
THANK YOU.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.533
I'M GETTING
OUT OF TOWN.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.733
I'M GOING TO VEGAS
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.433
I ADVISE Y'ALL
TO DO THE SAME.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.433
WHAT KIND OF ATTACK ?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.700
ATTACK, LARRY,
ANTHRAX, A BOMB,

06:25.733 --> 06:26.833
I DON'T KNOW.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.200
IT COULD BE SOMETHING CRAZY,
WHO KNOWS ?

06:28.233 --> 06:30.067
AND THIS IS...

06:30.100 --> 06:33.167
THEY SAID IT'S LIKE 90% SURE
THAT SOMETHING'S GONNA GO DOWN.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.267
WHY CAN'T
WE TELL ANYBODY ?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.067
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT PANIC, CHERYL.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.767
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
NOT TELLING ANYBODY.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.833
WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.833
YEAH, YOU GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

06:40.867 --> 06:45.167

06:49.100 --> 06:50.733
ALANIS MORRISSETTE
IS GONNA BE THERE.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.567
I MEAN, I'M JUST,
I'M THINKING OUT LOUD.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.067
WELL, WHY DON'T
WE CALL THE TERRORISTS

06:54.067 --> 06:56.333
AND ASK THEM COULD
THEY PICK ANOTHER WEEKEND

06:56.367 --> 06:57.667
THAT'S MORE
SUITED FOR YOU.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.433
POSTPONE THE BENEFIT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.133
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SAY THIS,
BUT LARRY'S RIGHT.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.833
IF WE DON'T SHOW UP
AT THE BENEFIT,
WHAT WILL PEOPLE...

07:05.867 --> 07:08.933
IF, WHAT ?

07:08.967 --> 07:12.867
LOOK, OKAY,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.800
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

07:14.833 --> 07:15.467
THANK YOU.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.067
I'M GOING TO VEGAS.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.100
OKAY, OKAY.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.133
Y'ALL OUT YOUR MIND.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.567
I'M SITTING HERE
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE,

07:20.600 --> 07:22.700
THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT A DAMN BENEFIT.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.067
WELL, CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET BACK INTO TOWN.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.067
HOPEFULLY
YOU'LL BE HERE.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.833
WOW.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.600
YEAH, LARRY.

07:34.867 --> 07:38.067
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW
WE CAN LEAVE THIS WEEKEND.

07:38.067 --> 07:41.967
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE
N.R.D.C. BENEFIT WAS MY IDEA.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.467
I TALKED THE BRAUDYS
INTO HAVING IT AT THEIR HOUSE.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.500
ALANIS MORRISSETTE

07:47.533 --> 07:50.733
I MEAN, I JUST...

07:50.767 --> 07:52.467

I CAN'T LEAVE TOWN.

07:54.467 --> 07:58.533
WELL, MAYBE, UH...

07:58.567 --> 08:00.633
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I CAN...

08:02.767 --> 08:05.100
I CAN GO.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.200
AND WHERE ARE YOU
GONNA GO ?

08:09.633 --> 08:15.700
I COULD GO GOLFING
TO PEBBLE BEACH, MAYBE ?

08:17.233 --> 08:21.533
MM-HMM, DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.700
WELL...

08:23.733 --> 08:26.233
FOR US TO BE APART
IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN ?

08:26.267 --> 08:30.667
THEN AT LEAST, YOU KNOW,
ONE OF US WOULD...

08:30.700 --> 08:33.600
SURVIVE.

08:33.633 --> 08:35.667
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
IF WE'RE GONNA GO,

08:35.700 --> 08:36.867
WE SHOULD
GO TOGETHER.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.933
WELL, NOT NECESSARILY.

08:42.433 --> 08:46.433
ALMOST SEEMS
A LITTLE SELFISH

08:47.833 --> 08:50.600
THAT YOU WOULD WANT
BOTH OF US TO...

08:52.067 --> 08:54.267
PERISH.

08:57.067 --> 09:00.800
SO, YOU'D BE FINE
GOING ON WITHOUT ME.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.433
WELL, IT WOULD BE...

09:04.467 --> 09:08.533
VERY DIFFICULT
AT FIRST I'M SURE.

09:08.567 --> 09:12.367
BUT HOPEFULLY
I COULD AT SOME POINT

09:12.400 --> 09:16.233
GET BACK SOME SEMBLANCE
OF A LIFE.

09:17.533 --> 09:23.200
OKAY, IF YOU FEEL
GOOD ABOUT...

09:23.233 --> 09:25.733
ONE OF US...

09:25.767 --> 09:29.367
DYING AND THE OTHER
ONE SURVIVING,

09:29.400 --> 09:31.100
AND YOU CAN
LIVE WITH THAT

09:31.133 --> 09:33.433
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE,

09:33.467 --> 09:36.767
THEN YOU SHOULD
GO GOLF THIS WEEKEND.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.067
THINK ABOUT IT.
WELL, I'LL THINK
ABOUT IT.

10:05.533 --> 10:06.700
HEY, MINDY.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.867
OH, LARRY,
PAUL'S NOT HERE.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.400
OH, UH, I CAME
ACTUALLY TO SEE YOU.

10:12.433 --> 10:13.833
DO YOU HAVE
A FEW MINUTES ?

10:13.867 --> 10:15.933
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.067
YOU CAME TO SEE ME ?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.700
YEAH.

10:18.733 --> 10:19.767
WHAT FOR ?

10:19.800 --> 10:23.267
OKAY, THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND A LITTLE CRAZY.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.267
BUT BELIEVE ME,
IT'S ALL TRUE.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.500
I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO HAS A FRIEND

10:29.533 --> 10:32.867
WHOSE BROTHER
WORKS IN THE C.I.A.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.933
AND HE HAS IT FROM
THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SOURCE

10:37.967 --> 10:41.933
THAT THERE'S GOING
TO BE A TERRORIST ATTACK

10:41.967 --> 10:45.233
ON LOS ANGELES
THIS WEEKEND.

10:45.267 --> 10:46.567
I TOLD YOU
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.500
I'M NOT
PUTTING YOU ON.
YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.233
THIS IS A JOKE,
OH, LARRY, COME ON.

10:50.267 --> 10:51.867
MINDY, MINDY,
THIS IS NOT A JOKE,
THIS IS THE TRUTH.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.333
PAUL PUT YOU
UP TO THIS ?

10:53.367 --> 10:55.900
NO, HE DIDN'T PUT ME UP TO IT,
I HAVEN'T EVEN SPOKEN TO HIM.

10:55.933 --> 10:59.033
YOU HAVE A CONTACT
IN THE GOVERNMENT ?

10:59.067 --> 11:01.500
TOTALLY RELIABLE.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.800
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

11:02.833 --> 11:06.067
MINDY, YOU'RE LIFE
IS IN DANGER.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.367
GET OUT OF HERE.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.067
MY GOD, WHAT KIND OF ATTACK
IS IT GONNA BE ?

11:10.100 --> 11:11.200
I DON'T KNOW,
IT WASN'T VERY SPECIFIC.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.633
WHERE ?

11:12.667 --> 11:13.733
I DON'T KNOW,
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.400
IT'S IN L.A.

11:15.433 --> 11:18.367
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
OH MY GOD, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.467
OKAY ?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.800
I HAVE TO CALL
MY SISTER.

11:20.833 --> 11:24.067
NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

11:24.067 --> 11:25.933
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOTHER,
SHE'S 80 YEARS OLD.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.967
SHE CAN'T SURVIVE
A TERRORIST ATTACK.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.233
WELL, YOU CAN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.233
MINDY.

11:31.267 --> 11:33.533
OKAY, OKAY,
SHE LIVES IN ORANGE COUNTY.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.300
SO, SHE'S KIND
OF FAR AWAY.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.567
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO ORANGE COUNTY,
THE TERRORISTS.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.800
BELIEVE ME, THEY HAVE
NOTHING IN ORANGE COUNTY.

11:37.833 --> 11:41.267
OKAY, ALRIGHT, SO, WE'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF TOWN, HUH ?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.400
ABSOLUTELY.

11:42.433 --> 11:43.800
OKAY, MAYBE WE'LL GO
TO THE DESERT, HUH ?

11:43.833 --> 11:44.533
MAYBE THAT
WILL BE GOOD ?

11:44.567 --> 11:45.600
PALM SPRINGS ?

11:45.633 --> 11:47.067
PALM SPRINGS IS VERY,
YES, WHY NOT ?

11:47.067 --> 11:49.833
IT'S 90 MINUTES,
IT'S VERY NICE, YEAH.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.333
WHERE DO YOU STAY
WHEN YOU'RE THERE ?

11:52.367 --> 11:53.233
FOUR SEASONS.

11:53.267 --> 11:54.267
FOUR SEASONS ?

11:54.300 --> 11:55.467
YEAH.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.600
MAYBE WE'LL GO THERE,
OR WE COULD GO UP NORTH MAYBE.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.167
SANTA BARBARA IS LOVELY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.633
WHERE ARE YOU
AND CHERYL GOING ?

12:02.667 --> 12:06.233
UNFORTUNATELY
WE CAN'T GO.

12:06.267 --> 12:12.300
YOU CAN'T, OH,
THAT BRAUDY'S N.R.D.C. EVENT.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.367
OH, YOU KNOW ABOUT
THAT THING, HUH ?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.533
OF COURSE
I KNOW ABOUT IT.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.167
OUR INVITATION GOT LOST
IN THE MAIL OR SOMETHING.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.500
I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF...

12:20.533 --> 12:22.433
NO, LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU AND CHERYL

12:22.467 --> 12:23.467
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.633
IT'S BETWEEN US
AND THE BRAUDYS,

12:24.667 --> 12:27.667
BUT IT'S AMAZING THAT
YOU GUYS ARE STAYING IN TOWN

12:27.700 --> 12:30.333
AND RISKING YOUR LIVES
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.500
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

12:32.533 --> 12:36.533
WELL, CHERYL WANTED TO LEAVE,
AND I THOUGHT IT'S BEST THAT

12:36.567 --> 12:38.167
WE GO TO THE BENEFIT.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.533
IT'S AMAZING.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.733
OKAY, I HAVE A MILLION
THINGS TO DO,

12:42.767 --> 12:44.867
BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.600
WHY DID YOU TELL ME ?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.067
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

12:48.067 --> 12:51.067
YOU'RE FRIENDS,
WE LIKE YOU SO MUCH,

12:51.067 --> 12:52.600
YOU AND PAUL,
YOU KNOW.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.867
I WAS DRIVING AROUND,
I SAW YOUR SHOP, I THOUGHT,

12:54.900 --> 12:56.933
I'VE GOT TO TELL MINDY.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.800
I HAVE REALLY
MISJUDGED YOU.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.367
I CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
YOU ARE AN
AMAZING PERSON.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.567
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL
HUMAN BEING.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.333
AND I JUST CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

13:06.367 --> 13:09.333
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
A GOOD FRIEND IS ALL.

13:09.367 --> 13:10.100
LISTEN !

13:10.133 --> 13:11.500
I HAVE SOME
SAMPLES HERE.

13:11.533 --> 13:14.067
I WANT YOU

13:14.067 --> 13:16.600
UM, GIVE THEM
TO CHERYL, OKAY ?

13:16.633 --> 13:18.267
WITH MY LOVE.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.333
HERE YOU GO.

13:19.367 --> 13:20.800

SHE'LL LIKE THESE.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.700
NOTHING FOR MEN ?

13:22.733 --> 13:26.500
OH, YEAH, HERE.

13:26.533 --> 13:29.067
UH, YEAH,
YOU'LL LIKE THESE.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.633
THIS IS AFTER SHAVE.

13:30.667 --> 13:31.267
UH-HUH.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.167
THIS IS BEFORE SHAVE.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.867
GOT YOU SOME OF THESE,
THESE ARE SAMPLES.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.133
WHAT ?

13:40.167 --> 13:45.167
THESE ARE MOISTURIZERS
FROM MINDY REISER'S SHOP.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.367
REALLY ?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.233
WELL, I WISH I WOULD'VE
KNOWN YOU WERE GOING.

13:48.267 --> 13:50.967
SHE CARRIES THAT PERFUME
THAT WANDA WEARS THAT I LOVE.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.400
OH.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.133
WOULD'VE HAD YOU
PICK ME UP A LITTLE BOTTLE.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.400
WHY DID YOU GO THERE ?

13:55.433 --> 14:01.067
YOU KNOW, KIND OF APOLOGIZE
FOR THE OTHER NIGHT.

14:01.067 --> 14:04.567
LARRY DAVID,
APOLOGIZE.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.367
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S VERY--

14:05.400 --> 14:06.667
WHY, IS THAT UNUSUAL ?

14:06.700 --> 14:09.433
IT'S UNUSUAL, YES,
HIGHLY UNUSUAL, YES.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.200
I FEEL LIKE I APOLOGIZE
TO SOMEBODY EVERYDAY.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.267
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

14:12.300 --> 14:13.867
WHO SAYS I'M SORRY
MORE THAN ME ?

14:13.900 --> 14:15.433
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
IN THE WORLD ?

14:15.467 --> 14:16.433

14:16.467 --> 14:19.767

ALRIGHT, BYE.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.333
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT ?

14:56.333 --> 14:59.767
OH, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I WENT
TO APOLOGIZE TO HIS WIFE.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.467
OH.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.367
AND WHAT WAS 90% ?

15:03.400 --> 15:08.067
HE ASKED ME WHAT
THE CHANCES WERE

15:08.100 --> 15:11.933
THAT THIS COULD
HAPPEN AGAIN.

15:11.967 --> 15:13.633
YOU KNOW,
THAT I'D IGNORE HER.

15:13.667 --> 15:14.733
RIGHT.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.133
UM, LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
DOING A LOT OF THINKING,

15:17.167 --> 15:20.367
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
RECONSIDER GOING TO THIS.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.733
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

15:21.767 --> 15:23.100
NO.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.400
I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY,
TO HANG AROUND HERE, WHAT FOR ?

15:25.433 --> 15:28.167
WE ARE GONNA

15:30.100 --> 15:31.067
WHERE ARE
ALL THE CARS ?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.300
I DON'T KNOW.

15:32.333 --> 15:36.067
IS THERE A VALET THAT
WE JUST MISSED OR SOMETHING ?

15:40.400 --> 15:40.900
HI.

15:40.933 --> 15:42.067
HEY, STU.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.667

15:56.367 --> 15:58.133

ONES HERE ?

15:58.167 --> 16:01.233
WHERE IS EVERYBODY ?

16:01.267 --> 16:03.100
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED
YOU'RE HERE.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.833
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A TERRORIST ATTACK

16:05.867 --> 16:10.367
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE OUT
THE ENTIRE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.700
SOME TIME
THIS WEEKEND.

16:11.733 --> 16:14.767
YOU'LL NOTICE
ALANIS MORRISSETTE
IS NOT HERE.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.867
OBVIOUSLY.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.667
SHE GOT VERY NERVOUS,
SO SHE SAID NO,

16:17.700 --> 16:18.567
SHE WASN'T
GONNA SING.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.067
SHE LEFT TOWN.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.067
REALLY ?

16:21.067 --> 16:25.600
'CAUSE SHE HEARD,
APPARENTLY THE WORD
JUST KIND OF SPREAD.

16:25.633 --> 16:29.467
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT'VE
STARTED WITH MINDY REISER.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.933
AND, GUESS
WHO TOLD MINDY ?

16:32.967 --> 16:35.700
WHO ?

16:35.733 --> 16:38.100
ME ?

16:38.133 --> 16:41.067
WHAT ?

16:41.067 --> 16:44.267
YOU TOLD MINDY REISER
ABOUT THIS ?

16:44.300 --> 16:45.600
OKAY, SO YOU KNEW.

16:45.633 --> 16:47.867
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WANDA SAID !

16:47.900 --> 16:50.700
SHE SAID, DON'T CAUSE A PANIC,
DON'T TELL PEOPLE.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.200
DID WE NOT HAVE
THIS DISCUSSION ?

16:52.233 --> 16:53.867
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING, OKAY...

16:53.900 --> 16:55.667
NO, THIS IS
A LITTLE EMBARRASSING.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.300
THIS IS HUMILIATING
BEYOND BELIEF IS WHAT THIS IS.

17:00.333 --> 17:03.300
I FELT BAD BECAUSE
I SNUBBED MINDY AT DINNER
THE OTHER NIGHT,

17:03.333 --> 17:05.067
AND I DIDN'T TALK
TO HER, AND I--

17:05.067 --> 17:06.467
TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS
GONNA BE A TERRORIST ATTACK

17:06.500 --> 17:07.900
IN LOS ANGELES
THIS WEEKEND ?

17:07.933 --> 17:09.833
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE, THEY DIDN'T DO IT !

17:09.867 --> 17:10.933
YOU TELL
MINDY REISER ?

17:10.967 --> 17:13.567
SHE HAS BETRAYED US
MORE TIMES.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.133
SHE OPENS HER MOUTH.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.500
YOU CAN'T TELL
THAT WOMAN ANYTHING.

17:16.533 --> 17:17.600
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE DON'T TALK TO HER ?

17:17.633 --> 17:20.867
I DON'T KNOW !

17:20.900 --> 17:22.200
AND BY THE WAY LARRY,

17:22.233 --> 17:25.500
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US
ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ATTAC.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.067
I DIDN'T TELL
ANYBODY ELSE.

17:27.067 --> 17:27.767
WELL, YOU TOLD MINDY.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.100
THAT'S REALLY
NICE OF YOU.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.633
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU CALL
YOUR FRIENDS, THE REISERS ?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.533
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND HAVE
A LITTLE BITE WITH THEM ?

17:33.567 --> 17:35.933
SINCE YOU SNUBBED THEM AND ALL,
GO AHEAD, ALRIGHT !

17:35.967 --> 17:37.733
I AM GOING TO BED.

17:37.767 --> 17:41.167
HAVE A LITTLE BITE
WITH THE REISERS.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.133
AT LEAST THEY PICK UP A CHECK
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

17:44.167 --> 17:46.267
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN ?

17:46.300 --> 17:48.733
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO,
EVERY TIME THE CHECK COMES,

17:48.767 --> 17:50.200
HOW YOU RUN OFF
TO THE BATHROOM.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.100
YOU DON'T THINK
I SEE THAT ?

17:51.133 --> 17:52.267
OH, FUCK YOU.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.600
HONEY, DON'T !

17:53.633 --> 17:55.433
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
ABOUT THAT BATHROOM TRICK ?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.767
I INVENTED THAT
BATHROOM TRICK.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.733
GO TO HELL !

17:58.767 --> 17:59.900
THE BATHROOM TRICK ?

18:00.067 --> 18:01.867
I GOT A PROBLEM,
A MEDICAL PROBLEM.

18:01.900 --> 18:02.867
OH, YEAH,
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.833
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
PAYING MONEY.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.933
NO, THANK YOU.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.267
I'LL TAKE ONE,
THANKS.

18:12.533 --> 18:15.767
MM, VERY GOOD.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.133
WHO'S THE CHEF ?

18:19.167 --> 18:22.633
I DON'T KNOW.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.067
I GUESS
I SHOULDN'T ASK HIM.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.367
NO, I DON'T
THINK YOU SHOULD.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.900
THANK YOU, OKAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH, COME ON.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.267
I JUST WANT TO KNOW,
FOR THE RESTAURANT.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.300
WERE YOU
NOT LISTENING

18:33.333 --> 18:35.400
WHEN WANDA TOLD YOU
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY ?

18:35.433 --> 18:38.100
SHE TRUSTED YOU NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

18:38.133 --> 18:41.800
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD
YOU TELL MINDY REISER ?

18:41.833 --> 18:43.733
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET ON HER GOOD SIDE.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.800
( toilet flushing )

18:56.400 --> 18:58.700
SO, I GUESS WHAT WE SHOULD DO
IS JUST HAVE IT HERE.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.067
WHAT ?

19:00.067 --> 19:01.900
JUST RESCHEDULE THE BENEFIT
AND HAVE IT HERE.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.067
OKAY.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.600
AND I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ASK
THE BRAUDYS TO COME OVER.

19:08.633 --> 19:09.600
THE BRAUDYS ?

19:09.633 --> 19:10.567
NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.933
THEY'RE NOT COMING,
FORGET IT.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.900
THEY WENT WAY
OVER THE LINE TONIGHT.

19:13.933 --> 19:16.467
INVITE THE REISERS,
NOT THE BRAUDYS.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.667
INVITE THE REISERS
FOR SPITE.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.167
THIS ISN'T
A GAME, LARRY.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.233
BRAUDYS, FREAKING.

19:23.267 --> 19:24.700
EVERYTHING'S FREAKING
WITH THIS GUY.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.067
WHAT IS, HE CAN'T
SAY THE WORD FUCK ?

19:26.100 --> 19:30.233
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY'D BE UPSET, LARRY.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.967
FREAKING ASSHOLE.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.300
YOU DON'T GARGLE MUCH,
DO YOU ?

19:41.333 --> 19:42.800
IT'S FUN.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.267
YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.867
WELL, YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU JUST LOST

19:47.900 --> 19:49.433
FOR THE N.R.D.C.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.800
* N-E-S-T-L-E-S

19:54.833 --> 19:58.767
* NESTLE'S MAKES
THE VERY BEST *

19:58.800 --> 20:02.433
* SORRY

20:08.467 --> 20:12.800
HEY, LARRY, HOW COME
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ?

20:12.833 --> 20:15.133
I HEARD THERE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A TERRORIST ATTACK

20:15.167 --> 20:16.633
AND YOU KNEW
ABOUT IT ?

20:16.667 --> 20:18.033
HOW COME YOU
NEVER TOLD ME ?

20:18.067 --> 20:21.200
I WASN'T ALLOWED
TO TELL ANYONE.

20:21.233 --> 20:22.967
YOU TOLD SOMEBODY.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.233
I MEAN, I FOUND OUT.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.067
SO, YOU COULD'VE
TOLD ME SOMETHING ?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.100
I COULD TELL,
TOO MANY PEOPLE,

20:29.133 --> 20:30.733
I JUST WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO.

20:30.767 --> 20:31.933
YOU KNOW, MY KIDS
COULD'VE BEEN WIPED OUT.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.467
YOU KNOW, THEY GO
TO SCHOOL, YOU KNOW ?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.733
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S OKAY,
NOTHING HAPPENED.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.900
I KNOW, BUT, I MEAN,
SOMETHING COULD'VE HAPPENED,

20:37.933 --> 20:39.167
WE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED,
YOU KNOW ?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.267
YOU COULD'VE JUST GIVEN ME
A LITTLE HINT, YOU KNOW ?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.533
OKAY, NEXT TIME,
I'LL TELL YOU.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.533
TAKE YOUR KIDS OUT OF THE SCHOOL
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.600
I'LL TELL YOU NEXT TIME,
I'M SORRY.

20:46.633 --> 20:49.133
YOU COULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.700
UM, LET ME
CALL YOU BACK.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.200
DO YOU HAVE
A MINUTE ?

20:54.233 --> 20:56.033
YEAH.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.467
LARRY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU KNEW

20:58.500 --> 21:00.667
THERE WAS A TERRORIST THREAT
AND THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

21:00.700 --> 21:01.733
OH, HERE WE GO
WITH THIS AGAIN.

21:01.767 --> 21:02.500
ME ?

21:02.533 --> 21:04.067
I COULDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.067
I MEAN, I'M THE PERSON THAT'S
HERE FOR YOU FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.433
I'VE TAKEN YOUR LAUNDRY
AND DRY CLEANING.

21:09.467 --> 21:10.967
I DIDN'T TELL
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

21:11.067 --> 21:13.600
I ONLY TOLD ONE PERSON,
YOU KNOW ?

21:13.633 --> 21:15.067
YOU'VE TOLD ME
SECRETS BEFORE.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.633
I'M SORRY.

21:16.667 --> 21:17.833
I'M SORRY.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.967
NOW I HAVE TO HAVE
EVERYBODY MAD AT ME ?

21:20.067 --> 21:21.633
'CAUSE I DIDN'T TELL
EVERYBODY I KNOW ?

21:21.667 --> 21:24.067
IT'S NOT MY FAULT,
I TOLD ONE PERSON.

21:26.267 --> 21:28.500
WANDA IS HERE,
SHE'S IN THE RESTROOM.

21:28.533 --> 21:29.633
SHE'LL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE

21:29.667 --> 21:30.900
AND SHE'D LIKE TO
SPEAK WITH YOU, LARRY.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.733
HEY, BIG MOUTH !

21:35.067 --> 21:37.900
WHAT DID
I TELL YOU, LARRY ?

21:39.433 --> 21:42.167
DO YOU THINK THIS'LL
GET ME OUT OF THE DOG HOUSE ?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.767
THIS IS HARD TO FIND.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.567
YOU CAN SMELL THAT ?

21:44.600 --> 21:47.100
YEAH, OH YEAH.

21:47.133 --> 21:48.500
SO, THAT'S THE ONE
THAT WANDA GOT.

21:48.533 --> 21:49.500
THAT'S IT, YEAH.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.233
I JUST HOPE IT
DOES THE TRICK.

21:51.267 --> 21:54.500
PAUL AND I SPENT THE WHOLE
WEEKEND IN PALM SPRINGS.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.933
IT WAS REALLY
A DISRUPTION.

21:56.967 --> 21:57.767
YEAH.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.633
TO PACK UP
AND LEAVE LIKE THAT.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.933
I'M SORRY THERE
WASN'T AN ATTACK.

22:01.967 --> 22:05.400
WELL, LARRY, I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
YOU HAD THE BEST OF INTENTIONS.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.867
BUT MY GOD, IT WAS A HUGE
INCONVENIENCE FOR US.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.733
YEAH, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

22:10.767 --> 22:12.067
YES, YES, I KNOW.

22:12.067 --> 22:14.133
AND WE DROVE FOR
THREE HOURS TO THE DESERT

22:14.167 --> 22:15.633
WITH THE DOG
AND THE CATS.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.267
FOUR SEASONS
WAS BOOKED.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.233
WE ENDED UP STAYING
AT A SUPER EIGHT MOTEL.

22:19.267 --> 22:20.367
IT WAS AWFUL.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.300
I'M SORRY
I MENTIONED ANYTHING.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.633
I TRIED TO
BE A NICE GUY,

22:23.667 --> 22:25.167
I'M TRYING TO HELP
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE,

22:25.200 --> 22:26.733
AND THEN YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE
WEEKEND ON MY ACCOUNT.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.967
LARRY, LARRY,
NO, NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

22:29.067 --> 22:31.367
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF THERE WAS A SMALL EXPLOSION,

22:31.400 --> 22:32.833
SOMETHING WHERE
NOBODY GOT HURT.

22:32.867 --> 22:35.467
A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE
FIRECRACKER OR SOMETHING.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.600
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU GUYS ?

22:36.633 --> 22:38.533
HOW DID THE N.R.D.C.
THING GO ?

22:38.567 --> 22:40.300
NOT TOO GOOD.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.733
WHAT HAPPENED ?

22:41.767 --> 22:43.333
NOBODY SHOWED UP.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.800
WHY NOT ?

22:44.833 --> 22:48.333
EVERYBODY HEARD ABOUT
THE TERRORIST ATTACK

22:48.367 --> 22:50.933
AND LEFT TOWN.

22:50.967 --> 22:54.067
OH MY GOD.

22:54.067 --> 22:55.433
'CAUSE I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING,

22:55.467 --> 22:57.333
I WAS WONDERING
IF PERHAPS

22:57.367 --> 22:58.833
YOU HAD MENTIONED
SOMETHING TO ANYONE.

22:58.867 --> 23:00.633
ME, WHY WOULD
I SAY ANYTHING ?

23:00.667 --> 23:02.300
YOU TOLD ME NOT
TO SAY ANYTHING.

23:02.333 --> 23:05.700
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

23:05.733 --> 23:07.700
HEY, IT'S MARTIN SHORT.

23:07.733 --> 23:08.633
LARRY ?

23:08.667 --> 23:09.833
I KNOW HIM.

23:09.867 --> 23:11.267
LARRY !

23:11.300 --> 23:12.633
LAR...

23:12.667 --> 23:16.567
MARTY.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.633
LARRY, OH, MY GOD,
LARRY, HOW ARE YOU ?

23:20.667 --> 23:21.400
GOOD, HOW YOU DOING ?

23:21.433 --> 23:22.900
I'M GOOD,
HOW ARE YOU ?

23:22.933 --> 23:25.167
GOOD, HOW'S YOUR SHOW DOING
ON THE COMEDY CENTRAL ?

23:25.200 --> 23:26.533
YOU DO THAT
BIG FAT GUY...

23:26.567 --> 23:27.600
PRIME TIME GLICK, YES.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.067
PRIME TIME GLICK ?

23:29.067 --> 23:30.200
HOW DO YOU DO THAT VOICE,
WHAT IS THAT, HOW DOES THAT ?

23:30.233 --> 23:31.333
I TRY AND
DO IT AT HOME.

23:31.367 --> 23:34.667
IT'S RANGES THAT GO HIGH
AND THEN GO VERY LOW.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.967
RANGES THAT GO HIGH
AND THEN GO VERY LOW.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.567
NO, BUT YOU'RE
NOT GOING LOW.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.967
HIGH, VERY HIGH.

23:41.067 --> 23:42.067
HIGH.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.067
NO, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE MISS PIGGY.

23:44.067 --> 23:45.767
NO, IT'S NOT
THAT AT ALL.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.533
IT'S MUCH MORE NOT
TO PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK,

23:48.567 --> 23:49.667
MUCH MORE ORIGINAL.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.767
OH, MY GOODNESS,
LARRY DAVID.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.500
OH, MY GOODNESS,
LARRY DAVID.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.933
HOW WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.233
HOW WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU.

23:56.267 --> 24:00.067
SEE YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF,
THAT FLAT NEW YORK THING.

24:00.067 --> 24:02.567
WELL, LET TRY,
LET ME TRY ONE MORE TIME.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.700
HIGH,
AND THEN LOW.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.333
AND THEN BE STUNNED
IN THE MIDDLE.

24:07.367 --> 24:10.567
NO, NO, NOW, SEE,
YOU'VE HAD A STROKE.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.900
YOU SEE, NOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO PLAY A STROKE VICTIM.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.267
OH, JESUS.

24:16.300 --> 24:17.367
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.600
I LEFT HER HANGING
IN THE STORE THERE,

24:19.633 --> 24:20.800
SHE'S GONNA BE MAD.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.933
THERE ARE MORE IMPERSONATIONS
I'D LOVE TO TEACH YOU.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.167
WELL, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.500
OKAY, GOOD TO
SEE YOU, LARRY.

24:25.533 --> 24:26.767
OKAY, B'BYE.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.833
PICK IT UP
JUST A LITTLE CLOSER.

24:39.867 --> 24:41.633
WE MAY NOT EVEN
NEED THIS ACTUALLY.

24:41.667 --> 24:42.867
YEAH,
I DON'T KNOW.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.100
THE ACOUSTICS ARE GREAT
IN THIS HOUSE.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.600
AND YOU WOULD
KNOW BECAUSE...

24:46.633 --> 24:48.833
WELL, WE OFTEN HAVE
FRIDAY NIGHT SERVICES HERE.

24:48.867 --> 24:51.400
OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

24:51.433 --> 24:53.967
I AM SO EXCITED.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.767
I MEAN, I'M ACTING
LIKE I'M NOT THRILLED

24:56.800 --> 24:57.767
TO BE SITTING
HERE WITH YOU,

24:57.800 --> 24:59.667
BUT I AM JUST OUT
OF MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.200
ME TOO, I'VE BEEN
URINATING ALL DAY.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.367
REALLY ?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.533
THAT'S THE EFFECT
I OFTEN HAVE ON PEOPLE.

25:06.067 --> 25:07.967
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME ?!

25:08.067 --> 25:10.667
THEY INVITED
THE REISERS AND NOT US ?

25:10.700 --> 25:13.233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.900
BUT I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING.

25:22.067 --> 25:23.267
THANK YOU.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.067
OH, MY GOD,
THANKS FOR COMING OVER,

25:25.100 --> 25:26.133
AND I CAN'T WAIT
FOR TONIGHT.

25:26.167 --> 25:27.767
YEAH, ME TOO,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.467
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.633
ALRIGHT.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.133
HEY, YOU GONNA DO,
"YOU OUGHT TO KNOW" ?

25:34.167 --> 25:35.600
WE CAN.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.400
YEAH, YOU WANT
THAT ONE ?

25:37.433 --> 25:38.267
YEAH.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.067
OKAY.

25:39.067 --> 25:40.133
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

25:40.167 --> 25:42.067
WE HAVEN'T DONE IT
IN A WHILE SO WE CAN DO IT.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.300
THE UNPLUGGED VERSION.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.567
A LOT OF DISCUSSION
ABOUT THAT SONG.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.367
YEAH, NON-STOP
FOR A WHILE.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.233
IT'S DYING DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, THANK GOD.

25:50.267 --> 25:52.800
YOU NEVER TELL
ANYBODY, HUH ?

25:52.833 --> 25:53.767
NO.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.200
I PURPOSELY
DON'T TELL ANYBODY

25:55.233 --> 25:57.067
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT
THE SONG IS WRITTEN FOR.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.533
I UNDERSTAND.

25:58.567 --> 26:00.067
EVER WANT TO
UNBURDEN YOURSELF,

26:00.100 --> 26:01.233
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW.

26:01.267 --> 26:04.300
I WON'T TELL A SOUL
I WON'T EVEN TELL HER.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.933
REALLY ?
ABSOLUTELY.

26:05.967 --> 26:08.700
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE PILLOW TALK
WHEN YOU DIVULGE THINGS ?

26:08.733 --> 26:10.933
WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME SOMETHING,
THEY ONLY TELL ME.

26:10.967 --> 26:12.067
THEY DON'T TELL
BOTH OF US.

26:12.067 --> 26:13.067
ALRIGHT,
THAT'S COOL.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.867
I HAVEN'T REALLY
TOLD ANYONE.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.767
IT WOULD MAYBE
GOOD TO...

26:17.800 --> 26:19.500
TELL YOU.

26:19.533 --> 26:21.233
BUT YOU CAN'T
TELL ANYBODY.

26:21.267 --> 26:24.767
DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.333
( tires screeching )

26:30.600 --> 26:32.700
( growling )

26:35.333 --> 26:38.200
MM, INTERESTING.

26:38.233 --> 26:40.067

26:41.167 --> 26:42.267
ALRIGHT,

26:47.067 --> 26:48.300
OH, SHE'S JUST TELLING ME
ABOUT WHAT SONGS

26:48.333 --> 26:49.233
SHE'S GONNA DO
AND ALL THAT.

26:49.267 --> 26:50.600
OH, OKAY.

26:50.633 --> 26:53.067
WELL, I'M GONNA MAKE THESE GUYS
A SANDWICH REAL QUICK.

26:53.067 --> 26:54.067
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING ?

26:54.067 --> 26:54.800

26:54.833 --> 26:55.633
NO, YOU'RE GOOD ?

26:55.667 --> 26:57.800

27:02.333 --> 27:04.067
THANKS, COOL.

27:04.067 --> 27:06.600
( tires screeching
and car crashing )

27:08.133 --> 27:09.433
JESUS.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.300
JESUS, YOU DIDN'T
EVEN FREAKING LOOK.

27:11.333 --> 27:12.933
YOU COME FLYING
DOWN THE HILL.

27:12.967 --> 27:14.933
YOU WERE GOING 1,000 MILES
AN HOUR ON THE LEFT SIDE,

27:14.967 --> 27:16.500
WHAT IS THIS,
AUSTRALIA ?

27:16.533 --> 27:17.300
ARE YOU OKAY ?

27:17.333 --> 27:19.067
YES, I'M OKAY,
MY NECK HURTS.

27:19.067 --> 27:20.500
THIS IS A CADILLAC,
A C.T.S.

27:20.533 --> 27:21.800
THIS IS
A BRAND NEW CAR.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.067
YOU'RE TRYING TO SABOTAGE
THE EVENT, AREN'T YOU ?

27:24.067 --> 27:25.733
WELL, BY THE WAY,
THANKS FOR INVITING US.

27:25.767 --> 27:26.500
FREAK YOU.

27:26.533 --> 27:27.367

27:27.400 --> 27:29.567
FREAK YOU !
FREAK YOU !

27:29.600 --> 27:34.867
* BUT THIS WON'T WORK NOW
THE WAY IT ONCE DID *

27:34.900 --> 27:40.233
* AND I WON'T KEEP IT UP
EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO *

27:40.267 --> 27:44.933
* ONCE I KNOW WHO I'M NOT
THEN I'LL KNOW WHO I AM *

27:44.967 --> 27:49.567
* BUT I KNOW I WON'T
KEEP ON PLAYING THE VICTIM *

27:51.333 --> 27:53.833
( applause )

28:02.067 --> 28:05.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES...

28:05.233 --> 28:07.133
MINDY REISER'S BEEN
SNUBBING ME ALL NIGHT.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.200
SHE HAS ?

28:08.233 --> 28:10.133
YEAH, SHE WON'T
EVEN LOOK AT ME.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.067
BECAUSE OF
THE MARTIN SHORT THING ?

28:12.067 --> 28:13.200
YEAH.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.067
I TURNED IT AROUND,
AND THEN I DO IT AGAIN.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.300
MM.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.500
I THINK WE HAVE
ONE SONG LEFT.

28:17.533 --> 28:19.967
AND IT'S A SONG THAT
WAS SPECIALLY REQUESTED,

28:20.067 --> 28:21.567
AND IT'S CALLED
"YOU OUGHT TO KNOW".

28:21.600 --> 28:23.067
IT GOES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

28:29.100 --> 28:33.333
* I WANT YOU TO KNOW

28:34.500 --> 28:38.733
* THAT I'M HAPPY FOR YOU

28:41.333 --> 28:43.600
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

28:43.633 --> 28:45.167
EXCUSE ME.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.100
( whispering )
I know who this song
is about.
