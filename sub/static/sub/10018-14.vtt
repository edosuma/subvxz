WEBVTT

00:06.827 --> 00:08.315
Previously on E.R.

00:08.350 --> 00:10.850
- Dr. Ross, phone for you.
- Who is it?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.588
- Your father.
- Who?

00:12.589 --> 00:14.773
- He said he was your dad.
- Yeah, this isn't a good time.

00:14.774 --> 00:17.512
Vucelich know who I was?
Didn't you tell him about me?

00:18.148 --> 00:19.811
- That I found it?
- I meant to.

00:20.545 --> 00:22.952
- The patient is being excluded?
- Oh, yes.

00:22.953 --> 00:26.358
It seems that he has a history of,
excuse me, neurological problems...

00:26.359 --> 00:29.434
Vucelich wouldn't drop bad outcomes
just to pretty-up his numbers, would he?

00:29.635 --> 00:30.918
I don't know.

00:30.919 --> 00:33.449
- You lied to me.
- What do you want from me?

00:33.550 --> 00:35.147
- The truth!
- She's dying, Ruby!

00:35.148 --> 00:36.363
Is that what you wanna hear?

00:38.026 --> 00:40.900
"The Right Thing"

00:45.894 --> 00:50.394
Oh, I was just dropping off
yesterday's post-op notes.

00:50.569 --> 00:52.563
That's okay. I was up reading.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.615
Didn't you have surgery this morning?

00:56.580 --> 00:57.861
Oh, damn!

01:03.258 --> 01:05.585
The file on Mrs. Rubadoux.

01:05.763 --> 01:08.386
- You finished with it?
- Yeah, I'll drop it off later.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.479
Get going. I'll take care of it.

01:18.035 --> 01:19.910
- Hey, Carter.
- Morning.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.873
And a grand one it is.

01:22.042 --> 01:24.369
Yeah, easy for you to say.
I'm not on until noon.

01:24.546 --> 01:27.384
Yeah, well, it's much more fun
to ride in together.

01:27.552 --> 01:30.888
- Don't you usually drive to work?
- My car's in the shop.

01:31.058 --> 01:34.726
Did you drive around for two, three
weeks with that brake-warning light on?

01:34.898 --> 01:39.398
No! A week. At most.

01:39.573 --> 01:41.449
Is your apartment on this line?

01:41.619 --> 01:45.572
- No, I'm on the Congress-O'Hare line.
- But you're taking Ravenswood today.

01:45.751 --> 01:48.042
- Yeah, it's Mark's line.
- This is us.

01:48.214 --> 01:51.253
Stop and shop
at Davey's Liquor Depot.

01:51.428 --> 01:53.221
Tequila shopping.
Doug Ross' birthday.

01:53.390 --> 01:55.598
- Margaritas at my apartment after work.
- Okay.

01:55.769 --> 01:57.264
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:57.439 --> 01:58.851
Right.

01:59.025 --> 02:02.812
I'm doing an endarterectomy at 11:00,
if any of your residents want to observe.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.031
And give them an excuse
to miss my rounds?

02:05.203 --> 02:06.947
How thoughtless of me.

02:07.123 --> 02:09.032
- Peter.
- Morning.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.954
Hey, there. So good of you to wake.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.169
- I'm sorry. I was working late last night.
- And you overslept.

02:14.344 --> 02:16.172
- It won't happen again.
- I hope not.

02:16.347 --> 02:19.802
I think the patient might have questioned
your professionalism.

02:19.979 --> 02:25.488
- I stayed up reading the research files.
- Impressive, but diligence is no excuse.

02:25.656 --> 02:28.327
There now, the lecture is over.

02:28.494 --> 02:32.447
Mrs. Rubadoux, Mr. Roth,
Warrington, Dorgan, McFarland...

02:32.627 --> 02:35.084
And these patients
have what in common?

02:35.256 --> 02:38.176
You used Lazerol and the
clamp-and-run technique on them.

02:38.804 --> 02:41.428
We used the clamp-and-run.

02:41.601 --> 02:42.930
I went through the charts.

02:43.104 --> 02:47.187
I'm trying to understand why all of these
patients were excluded from the study.

02:47.361 --> 02:51.029
Well, they each had complications
which made them unsuitable candidates.

02:51.201 --> 02:54.205
- Shouldn't we determine that before?
- They were emergent cases.

02:54.374 --> 02:55.869
- Would you have let them die?
- No.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.715
This is the first research project
you've participated in?

02:58.882 --> 03:00.128
- Yes.
- Then it's my fault.

03:00.301 --> 03:03.887
I failed to communicate the magnitude
and scope of this kind of study.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.515
- No, I understand the scope.
- I don't think you do.

03:07.063 --> 03:11.147
Mrs. Rubadoux had pulmonary disease,
renal insufficiency and heart failure.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.858
She was never a candidate for the study.
Thank you. I'll sign those later.

03:15.036 --> 03:16.911
- But with Mr. Roth-
- With Mr. Roth...

03:17.081 --> 03:20.583
...we changed surgical procedure in
mid-course which benefited the patient.

03:20.754 --> 03:23.711
Would you have us continue the
clamp-and-run just to include him?

03:23.885 --> 03:26.342
No, but there are rules
for compiling data, right?

03:26.515 --> 03:29.720
We're talking about saving lives.
You and I have talked about risks...

03:29.896 --> 03:32.471
...related to this extraordinary level
of medicine.

03:32.651 --> 03:35.440
We'd never take the first step
if we didn't take risks.

03:35.614 --> 03:38.286
Now, I hope that as we go along,
you can grasp that.

03:38.453 --> 03:39.865
I'll try to.

03:40.039 --> 03:42.876
Perhaps I was foolish
to bring you in on the team.

03:43.044 --> 03:44.290
No, sir, I don't think so.

03:44.463 --> 03:46.790
Third-year residents
rarely have the maturity.

03:46.968 --> 03:48.761
You are lucky to have this opportunity.

03:48.930 --> 03:52.099
Perhaps you don't realize
how lucky you are.

03:53.187 --> 03:55.431
Maybe you ought to take a day
to consider that.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:53.545 --> 04:56.549
Sorry. Thanks.

04:56.718 --> 04:59.045
Carter, seeing as how you have
so much time...

04:59.222 --> 05:01.300
...I've got a knee lac
on a 6-year-old in 2.

05:01.476 --> 05:03.934
Can't do it. We are observing
a thyroidectomy at 11...

05:04.106 --> 05:05.815
...and we've got rounds at 10.

05:05.984 --> 05:07.230
- You've got time.
- What?

05:07.403 --> 05:09.065
- Make yourself useful.
- Dr. Benton-

05:09.240 --> 05:10.985
- About that knee lac...
- Do you mind?

05:11.160 --> 05:14.698
Paramedics are pulling up with an
apparently intoxicated street individual.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.166
- Be my guest.
- Man!

05:17.338 --> 05:18.917
Come on. I've missed you, Carter.

05:19.091 --> 05:20.836
By the way, happy birthday, Dr. Ross.

05:21.011 --> 05:23.136
It's not my birthday.
That's an ugly rumor.

05:23.307 --> 05:26.725
And, Jerry, Groundhog Day is over,
so let's get rid of that guy.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.316
I am so sorry, Marguerite. I just
can't understand how this happened.

05:30.486 --> 05:32.611
My foot hit the ice.
My bum hit the bricks.

05:32.782 --> 05:35.821
I shoveled all the steps,
but there it was, third from the top.

05:35.996 --> 05:38.953
A small, yet undeniably
slick patch of ice.

05:39.127 --> 05:40.872
I'm gonna live, Edward. Don't worry.

05:41.047 --> 05:42.958
Yes, but why? Why did this happen?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.923
- It was an accident.
- There are no accidents.

05:46.139 --> 05:48.383
He overthinks things.
Studying to be an analyst.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.555
- Psychoanalyst?
- Scary, huh?

05:50.731 --> 05:53.306
I still can't believe
my daughter married him.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.065
Nathan Conley, 27-years-old.

05:56.241 --> 05:59.078
- ETOH intoxication, ALOC, ataxic.
- Oh, man.

05:59.246 --> 06:03.329
- Nystagmus, BP 90/40, resps 14.
- Excuse me, I'm gonna move upwind.

06:03.504 --> 06:05.961
- Who called it in?
- Some deadbeat threw him out.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.837
Nathan couldn't stop throwing up. Drank
a gallon of vodka, took some Xanax.

06:10.015 --> 06:12.176
- Some Xanax?
- The only number he could think of.

06:17.362 --> 06:19.689
- Did you make up today's schedule?
- Like every day.

06:19.866 --> 06:21.278
- Where is it?
- That is it.

06:21.453 --> 06:24.028
I was assisting Dr. Zarem on
a parathyroidectomy at 11...

06:24.207 --> 06:27.496
...and Dr. Enari on a nephrectomy at 3.
This says Bachtell's assisting.

06:27.672 --> 06:31.542
Dr. Vucelich said you were going to
be tied up in ER, so I reassigned.

06:34.768 --> 06:38.520
- Mark and Susan, really?
- Carter said they were very chummy.

06:38.692 --> 06:43.072
- On the El? I thought Susan drove.
- I saw them in the lounge yesterday.

06:43.242 --> 06:46.578
Hey, I saw them in the cafeteria.

06:46.748 --> 06:48.789
Susan, how are you this morning?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.584
I'm fine. Thank you.
Haven't I already seen you today?

06:51.965 --> 06:55.004
Yes, you know, you have.
You have seen me today.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.554
Carol, what do you say
we get to that earache in 1?

06:57.726 --> 07:00.016
Oh, right. Earache.

07:02.150 --> 07:05.487
- Did you lose consciousness?
- Not this time, she didn't.

07:05.657 --> 07:07.401
- This time?
- Two months ago...

07:07.577 --> 07:11.364
...I stumbled over his new puppy
and hit my head on the driveway.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.869
My wife and I, we want children, but...

07:14.506 --> 07:16.500
Okay, let's just get it out in the open.

07:16.676 --> 07:20.843
I have some problems with commitment,
accepting responsibility.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.727
We thought a puppy might help.

07:22.979 --> 07:25.983
- Any blurry vision this time?
- No, just the cut.

07:26.152 --> 07:29.773
Do you think that I could somehow
be causing these accidents?

07:29.950 --> 07:33.037
I know that we've been having
some difficulties since you moved in.

07:33.206 --> 07:34.701
Let the doctor work, Edward.

07:34.876 --> 07:38.413
- Are you allergic to lidocaine?
- I wasn't before.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.632
I had stitches on my arm last summer.

07:40.803 --> 07:42.631
Edward sliced me with a Weed Whacker.

07:42.806 --> 07:45.133
Oh, my God, I did. I did, didn't I?

07:45.520 --> 07:50.232
I can't believe this.
I'm experiencing displacement.

07:50.946 --> 07:56.193
That's a defense mechanism wherein
feelings of hostility are inappropriate-

07:56.372 --> 07:58.450
Inappropriately redirected!

07:59.461 --> 08:02.037
Sorry about this. My daughter,
the only one with a job...

08:02.216 --> 08:06.513
...had to go to work today,
so Edward brought me in.

08:06.682 --> 08:09.175
It's okay.
Have you had a tetanus booster?

08:09.354 --> 08:10.635
Three months ago.

08:10.815 --> 08:15.279
Cut my leg on the basement stairs.
Tripped over Edward's golf clubs.

08:18.036 --> 08:20.410
- Banana bag's going.
- Are we done?

08:20.582 --> 08:22.576
What's the deal, Carter?
Surgery withdrawal?

08:22.753 --> 08:25.043
I ordered a blood alcohol level
and a tox screen.

08:25.216 --> 08:28.552
Okay, get a CBC, stick him for a glucose
and let's get a Chem-20.

08:28.722 --> 08:31.096
- His lytes have gotta be all screwed up.
- Got it.

08:31.268 --> 08:36.017
Scattered rales bilaterally.
Did you check his pupils?

08:41.578 --> 08:45.199
- Equal, round and reactive.
- Saline's going.

08:45.377 --> 08:48.795
Let's give him naloxone, two IV push.
And why are we doing that, Carter?

08:48.966 --> 08:50.676
To reverse the narcotic effect.

08:50.845 --> 08:52.922
Are we boring you,
or is it the way he smells?

08:53.099 --> 08:54.892
Okay, check his head for contusions.

08:55.061 --> 08:59.311
- Glucose is 40.
- Give him glucose and thiamine.

08:59.485 --> 09:01.812
- Why are we giving him thiamine?
- I don't know.

09:01.990 --> 09:07.119
Given his nutritional state, glucose can
precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy.

09:07.291 --> 09:11.339
Symptoms which include ataxia
and paralysis of eye movement.

09:12.175 --> 09:14.502
Isn't it nice to know
you can learn something new?

09:15.848 --> 09:17.723
Prep for a gastric lavage. I'll be back.

09:19.771 --> 09:23.060
Oh, and, Carter, I want you to do
a neuro check every 15 minutes.

09:23.236 --> 09:25.314
And don't forget to do a stool guaiac.

09:25.657 --> 09:29.872
Good to see you back down here, Carter.
We missed you.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.580
- Hey, Mark, how's it going?
- I'm ready for a margarita.

09:32.753 --> 09:34.664
- Little celebration?
- It's your birthday.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.212
No, I mean about you and Susan.
I want you to know I think it's great.

09:38.388 --> 09:40.216
You two went home together
last night?

09:40.392 --> 09:44.772
- What? We arrived this morning, but-
- Know what? You can fill me in later.

09:45.776 --> 09:47.605
Dr. Greene.

09:48.823 --> 09:51.447
Hi, I'm Reilly Brown. We haven't met.
You're Dr...?

09:51.620 --> 09:54.374
Mark Greene. Shouldn't you be
in high school somewhere?

09:54.542 --> 09:57.462
I'm a lot older than I look, 21.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.709
- What have you got, Reilly?
- Wilson Wolfe, 50.

09:59.885 --> 10:02.010
Stuck his right hand in the snow blower.

10:02.181 --> 10:05.018
BP 120/80, pulse 106.
I think he's a little nervous.

10:05.186 --> 10:07.227
- Lose any fingers?
- No. Got them right here.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.894
Oh, good work there, Reilly.

10:09.068 --> 10:11.608
- Dr. Benton.
- What is it, Carter?

10:11.781 --> 10:14.738
I can understand if you're upset about
my claiming that aneurysm.

10:14.912 --> 10:17.487
But I don't see why
my surgical education should suffer.

10:17.667 --> 10:19.661
There's no surgical services.
Back to work.

10:19.837 --> 10:21.962
- Who needs help in here?
- Get back to work!

10:22.133 --> 10:23.509
Hi, I'm Reilly Brown...

10:23.677 --> 10:26.550
- Mark, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure. Everything okay?

10:26.725 --> 10:30.595
- Yeah, yeah. No big deal.
- Reilly, that's all. You can go now.

10:30.773 --> 10:33.611
BP is 120/80.

10:33.779 --> 10:37.197
Mr. Wolfe here seems to have put
his hand into a snow blower.

10:37.369 --> 10:43.127
Yeah, something was blocking it.
I can't believe I was that stupid.

10:43.296 --> 10:45.539
- Lots of people are.
- We've got a pumper.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.758
Okay, Lydia, inflate the BP cuff.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.306
We have the two fingers.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.967
- Mr. Wolfe, are you right-handed?
- Yes.

10:52.145 --> 10:54.056
Not anymore, you're not.

10:55.317 --> 10:58.938
Haleh said Nathan's waking up.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.739
Hey! What are you doing?

11:02.664 --> 11:04.954
- Call Security.
- Leave us alone!

11:05.127 --> 11:08.878
- No, no, you cannot be here.
- I have to take care of him.

11:09.050 --> 11:11.508
- Hey, Carter.
- It's okay, baby. I'll take care of you.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.175
Must be the girlfriend.

11:13.809 --> 11:16.183
- What exactly do you suspect?
- I'm not quite sure.

11:16.355 --> 11:20.356
- But you do have suspicions?
- He's not including any bad outcomes.

11:20.529 --> 11:22.607
- And you're certain?
- Yep.

11:23.284 --> 11:26.204
- And when you confronted him?
- He said it wasn't true.

11:26.373 --> 11:28.367
- But you think it is.
- He explained two...

11:28.543 --> 11:30.253
...but there are three others.

11:30.422 --> 11:33.129
First there were five,
and now there're only three?

11:33.302 --> 11:35.047
- Yeah.
- I'd make sure.

11:35.222 --> 11:39.638
- I'm going over the charts again.
- Maybe he can explain all of them.

11:39.814 --> 11:41.475
He took me off the surgical service.

11:41.650 --> 11:44.903
He could have dozens of reasons
to do that.

11:45.073 --> 11:47.317
Look, if I was going
to talk to somebody...

11:47.494 --> 11:50.248
...I mean, officially, who would it be?

11:50.416 --> 11:53.669
The dean. But going up
against a guy like Vucelich...

11:54.214 --> 11:56.921
He's one of the top cardiovascular
surgeons in the country.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.766
What if it comes down
to your word against his?

11:59.933 --> 12:05.311
- You don't think I should pursue it?
- If you're wrong, your career's over.

12:12.539 --> 12:15.210
- I can't believe you made me eat chili.
- I didn't.

12:15.377 --> 12:17.953
Yes, you did.
You held a gun to my head...

12:18.132 --> 12:19.841
Watch out!

12:23.350 --> 12:25.510
Help! Help! My leg!

12:25.687 --> 12:27.017
All right, don't move him.

12:27.190 --> 12:29.813
- What's your name?
- Paul.

12:29.987 --> 12:31.648
- Just relax. You got it?
- Yeah.

12:31.823 --> 12:34.613
Lift this bike up. Thanks, Jerry.
Let's just back it up here.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.448
- This is a cool bike.
- Kind of heavy.

12:36.624 --> 12:39.627
- Please don't tell him I'm here.
- Is someone after you?

12:39.796 --> 12:40.995
- He's gonna kill me.
- Who?

12:41.173 --> 12:44.592
My father. He won't let me have a
motorcycle. Doesn't think they're safe.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.137
I guess you didn't listen to him.
Lie back down.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.977
All right. I bought it this morning.
It was great until the throttle stuck.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.393
- I couldn't stop it.
- Lie down. Lie down.

13:15.902 --> 13:17.647
- Dr. Benton?
- What is it, Carter?

13:17.822 --> 13:20.945
Well, I now know you have
the utmost lack of respect for me.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.076
You can quit the study,
but you should have told me.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.088
- Who told you I quit the study?
- Everybody in the last hour...

13:27.256 --> 13:29.927
...and I think I had the right to know
before they did.

13:32.056 --> 13:36.437
It's more complicated than that, Carter.
I did not quit the study.

13:36.606 --> 13:38.434
Right.

13:43.952 --> 13:46.659
- I've gotta get rid of the bike!
- Settle down, Paul.

13:46.832 --> 13:48.625
I've got the pink slip in my pocket.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.539
Maybe somebody here will buy it.

13:50.714 --> 13:53.290
It's a little damaged.
How much do you want for it?

13:53.469 --> 13:56.389
I'm trying to help him out.
His father is gonna clobber him.

13:56.558 --> 13:58.636
Yeah, sure.

13:58.937 --> 14:01.810
Looks like a fractured fibula.
I can take him from here, Susan.

14:01.985 --> 14:03.979
Yeah. "Take him" is right.

14:04.155 --> 14:06.779
Okay. See you later.

14:06.952 --> 14:09.492
- You don't have to tell my dad, right?
- How old are you?

14:10.249 --> 14:13.372
- Seventeen.
- Yeah. Sorry. You're a minor.

14:14.006 --> 14:16.760
Maybe he'll be grateful
that you didn't kill yourself.

14:16.928 --> 14:18.257
I doubt it.

14:21.019 --> 14:24.437
- Miss Boulet?
- Ruby, what are you doing here?

14:24.608 --> 14:26.603
I just wanted to thank you again...

14:26.779 --> 14:28.654
- ... for all your help.
- You're welcome.

14:28.824 --> 14:32.991
And to let you know my sweetheart
passed away yesterday.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.416
Oh, Ruby. I'm so sorry.

14:37.173 --> 14:40.211
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

14:40.387 --> 14:42.880
Not great.

14:43.058 --> 14:44.470
I knew it was gonna happen...

14:44.644 --> 14:48.146
...but I guess you really never believe it
until it does.

14:48.944 --> 14:53.694
Anyway, the services
are this afternoon...

14:53.729 --> 14:55.162
at 4:00...

14:55.247 --> 14:59.711
...at the Mount Sinai Cemetery,
you know, off Grand.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.455
I know you' re busy,

15:02.166 --> 15:06.053
but if you'd like to come, it's okay.

15:07.185 --> 15:08.929
Thank you, Ruby.
I would like to come.

15:09.105 --> 15:11.942
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.401
I'll see you later.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.028
- Carter.
- Nathan's back asleep...

15:18.204 --> 15:22.039
...having puked three more times.
Angel's awake, weepy and full of regret.

15:22.211 --> 15:26.046
"Never gonna drink another drop," she
says. Great couple of SHPOS, these two.

15:26.219 --> 15:28.712
- What did you just say?
- SHPOS. It means subhuman-

15:28.890 --> 15:31.977
No, I know what it means, thank you.

15:32.146 --> 15:35.352
I've gotta get these x-rays
to the O.R.

15:35.986 --> 15:38.064
Carter's been hanging around
Benton too much.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.522
Haven't we all.

15:39.701 --> 15:43.868
Bad day at Black Rock. Multiple
7- year-olds on their way in. Animal bites.

15:44.042 --> 15:48.589
- A petting zoo run amuck.
- Happy birthday, dear Doug.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.679
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:57.608 --> 16:01.395
- How's Ruby? Mr. Rubadoux.
- He's hanging in.

16:01.574 --> 16:04.327
His wife died yesterday.

16:04.495 --> 16:07.949
The service is at 4:00 today, Mount
Sinai. Do you want to go with me?

16:08.127 --> 16:12.175
I don't think I can make it.
I'm pretty jammed up today.

16:13.762 --> 16:17.015
These elevators take forever.
I'm gonna take the stairs.

16:20.691 --> 16:23.189
How long have you had that cough?

16:23.413 --> 16:26.734
I don't know. A while.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.154
Your chest x-rays will show us more.

16:31.043 --> 16:33.286
- Do they show everything?
- Why?

16:34.424 --> 16:37.178
- Maybe they'll show I have AIDS.
- Do you?

16:39.475 --> 16:43.641
Yeah. Look, you don't have to
tell Nathan about me, right?

16:44.275 --> 16:48.228
Have you been sick with anything else?
Fevers, rashes, night sweats?

16:48.407 --> 16:51.613
No. Just the cough.

16:52.665 --> 16:55.621
Okay, get a CBC, ABG, Chem-20...

16:55.795 --> 16:59.298
...a UA, hepatitis titers,
place a PPD and get a CD-4.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.182
You might have pneumonia...

17:03.351 --> 17:06.354
...so I'm gonna keep you here for a while
and run some tests.

17:06.982 --> 17:11.637
Look, you don't have
to tell Nathan about me.

17:12.622 --> 17:13.872
Right?

17:14.287 --> 17:17.160
It's against the law
for me to tell him. You should.

17:18.294 --> 17:20.169
He has a right to know.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.509
And if he's sick, he should be getting
treatment, and so should you.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.840
I just think he might get mad at me,
you know?

17:30.316 --> 17:35.860
And he might want to take off
or something, and he's all I have.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.374
- Can you make that out to "cash"?
- You got a deal.

17:42.546 --> 17:44.706
- You got robbed.
- I'm doing this as a favor.

17:44.883 --> 17:47.293
You still have to explain
what happened to your leg.

17:47.471 --> 17:49.050
- Oh, God.
- Tell your dad...

17:49.224 --> 17:51.978
...you were hitchhiking
and got picked up by a motorcycle...

17:52.146 --> 17:53.725
- ... and bam!
- Mark!

17:53.899 --> 17:57.402
He hates hitchhiking too,
but at least I'll only be grounded.

17:57.573 --> 18:00.410
Watch out for the throttle.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.577
- So I got lucky.
- In more ways than one, I hear.

18:05.754 --> 18:07.083
- What?
- Nothing.

18:07.257 --> 18:09.832
Lydia, what did you hear?

18:10.387 --> 18:13.177
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
- Only in my stomach.

18:13.351 --> 18:15.511
Okay, okay. Sit back.

18:15.688 --> 18:18.478
What have you got?

18:18.652 --> 18:21.406
T-Ball, is that you?
I haven't seen you in a while.

18:21.574 --> 18:23.782
My stomach hurts for real.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.614
It does! I ain't lying to you.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.833
Yep. Jeanie.

18:33.011 --> 18:37.012
I can't remember his real name, but
he's under T-Ball in the turkey file.

18:37.185 --> 18:40.438
- Frequent flyer. Drug seeking.
- Are you sure? He seems to be in pain.

18:40.608 --> 18:44.478
You'll get used to them. They'll do
anything for Valium, Percodan, Demerol.

18:44.657 --> 18:48.990
Let him moan and groan for an hour.
He'll get bored, go somewhere else.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.871
Carter! I asked you to wake
Nathan Conley up every 15 minutes.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.838
- I had something to do.
- You had that, and you didn't do it.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.303
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- I want chest films on him.

18:59.475 --> 19:02.348
Jerry, I need you to call Social Services.

19:02.522 --> 19:04.647
I've got an AIDS patient
who needs placement.

19:04.818 --> 19:07.441
- This thing's still here?
- It belongs to Dr. Greene now.

19:07.698 --> 19:09.110
Mark bought a motorcycle?

19:09.284 --> 19:11.029
Got it cheap.
There's only one helmet.

19:11.204 --> 19:14.493
- You're gonna have to get your own.
- What?

19:14.669 --> 19:19.880
When spring comes, you guys'll be riding
in on this instead of the El. I would.

19:20.054 --> 19:23.306
- What are you talking about?
- You and Dr. Greene.

19:23.476 --> 19:26.266
- I think you make a great couple.
- Excuse me.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.728
- I'm looking for Dr. Douglas Ross.
- He's with a patient right now.

19:29.904 --> 19:31.150
Can I tell him who's here?

19:32.242 --> 19:35.696
- Now, you, over there.
- I want to sit by Joseph.

19:35.873 --> 19:38.830
- I don't want her near me!
- Bet you can't wait to have that baby.

19:39.004 --> 19:41.544
The baby part's fine.
It's when they get to this age...

19:41.717 --> 19:45.765
Hey, you know what, guys? Nurse
Hathaway, will you give us a hand?

19:45.933 --> 19:49.269
- I want to sit by Joseph.
- Get her away from me!

19:49.439 --> 19:52.063
I didn't even want you
to come to my birthday party.

19:52.236 --> 19:54.064
You're gonna sit over here.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.735
- Dr. Ross?
- Yeah.

19:55.909 --> 19:57.535
A guy at the desk wants to see you.

19:57.704 --> 19:59.497
- Who is it?
- Said you'd know him.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.159
Surprise for your birthday.

20:08.515 --> 20:10.842
Doug?

20:11.020 --> 20:13.477
Who is it?

20:20.411 --> 20:22.987
My father.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.643
Carol, I looked up
T- Ball's card in the file.

20:37.818 --> 20:41.189
He's always claimed back pain.
This time it's his stomach.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.276
- Guess he's branching out.
- Maybe...

20:43.453 --> 20:47.038
...but I ran some additional blood tests,
just in case.

20:49.255 --> 20:51.332
First my parents wouldn't let me
have one...

20:51.509 --> 20:54.298
...and then after med school,
my wife wouldn't let me.

20:54.472 --> 20:55.718
Got a good one here.

20:55.892 --> 20:59.228
- You know about motorcycles?
- Five brothers. Had them in the yard.

20:59.398 --> 21:02.651
You better get a lock and chain.
E- Ray got his stolen.

21:02.821 --> 21:06.109
- Keep it in your apartment.
- Third floor, no elevator.

21:06.285 --> 21:08.612
Susan could keep it in her place.

21:13.799 --> 21:17.004
- I'm looking for Carter.
- I haven't seen him.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.887
- Have you seen Carter?
- Is he missing again?

21:20.060 --> 21:24.441
It looks like Angel's got pneumocystis.
I asked him to order a bronchoscopy.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.313
Angel?

21:26.488 --> 21:29.028
Oh, man,
I was afraid this would happen.

21:29.201 --> 21:33.036
I had a feeling she was gonna leave.
That girl was too scared.

21:40.471 --> 21:44.342
- If you need to help, I can wait.
- I'm a pediatrician.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.524
- You've got a damn exciting job here.
- Only if you're unlucky...

21:47.693 --> 21:49.901
...which I happen to be today.

21:50.072 --> 21:53.989
- Don't they need this?
- They've got plenty of those inside.

21:54.162 --> 21:57.035
Come on. Come on out, Doug.
Come on, Dougy. Come on.

21:57.210 --> 21:59.881
My name isn't Dougy anymore.

22:01.551 --> 22:04.222
Is that why you came here?
To play ball with your boy?

22:05.140 --> 22:08.263
- Not with this. If this was basketball...
- We don't have one.

22:08.438 --> 22:11.477
Remember when you were a kid,
I used to put you on my shoulders...

22:11.652 --> 22:15.404
...and you'd slam-dunk.
"Two points, two points! " you'd scream.

22:15.576 --> 22:19.493
- How's your mother?
- She's fine. She's happy.

22:22.338 --> 22:24.463
- She deserves it.
- I'll tell her you said so.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.378
No, you won't.

22:28.432 --> 22:32.018
You wouldn't even tell her you saw me.
Afraid it will upset her.

22:32.189 --> 22:34.563
Then she'll get all melancholy.

22:38.742 --> 22:41.829
People never gave her enough credit.
She's a strong woman.

22:42.958 --> 22:45.534
She kind of had to be, didn't she?

22:46.673 --> 22:50.508
- She walked out on me once.
- Compared to the 12 you walked out.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.470
- You mean walked out on you?
- What are you doing here?

22:53.644 --> 22:55.472
What do you want from me?

22:55.647 --> 22:58.223
I don't want anything from you.

23:00.656 --> 23:05.821
You're all over the airwaves. You're
a big hero. I was pretty proud of you.

23:10.841 --> 23:14.973
- I do have regrets.
- I've gotta go to work.

23:15.141 --> 23:16.684
Yeah.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.894
Doug.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.484
Happy birthday, son.

23:31.628 --> 23:35.546
- I'm turned around. Is the El this way?
- It's that way.

23:46.864 --> 23:49.488
- Dr. Vucelich?
- Mr. Carter.

23:49.661 --> 23:53.079
- You look winded.
- Yeah, I was hurrying. Dr. Vucelich...

23:53.251 --> 23:56.088
...I know Dr. Benton left the study,
and I wanted to say...

23:56.256 --> 24:00.589
...that I've learned more under you
than in four years of medical school.

24:00.764 --> 24:03.304
And I'd very much like to
continue on the team.

24:04.270 --> 24:07.606
There's initiative, wouldn't you say?

24:08.653 --> 24:12.524
For better or worse, there seems to be a
plethora of students on the team now.

24:12.702 --> 24:15.824
I can't see that I would have anything
of substance for you to do...

24:16.000 --> 24:18.575
...since you're way beyond scut work.

24:20.007 --> 24:21.336
Best of luck.

24:22.469 --> 24:24.547
Excuse me.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.223
- Did you ask him to take an AIDS test?
- He says it gives him the creeps.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.569
Bilateral perihilar right there.
He needs to know Angel has AIDS...

24:33.740 --> 24:34.986
...so he might have it too.

24:35.159 --> 24:37.153
You can't tell him. The law protects her.

24:37.329 --> 24:40.083
- I could if they were married.
- And they're not.

24:40.251 --> 24:44.715
Who's protecting Nathan and
all the women he might have sex with?

24:44.885 --> 24:47.045
Ethically, I agree with you.

24:47.222 --> 24:49.632
- The law is the law, right?
- Even if it's not right.

24:50.645 --> 24:52.639
Hey, T-Ball. Are you giving up?

24:52.815 --> 24:56.317
CBC showed microcytic anemia.
Blood smear showed red-cell stippling.

24:56.489 --> 24:59.741
Get a blood lead level,
80 micrograms per deciliter.

24:59.911 --> 25:02.072
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin,
lead poisoning.

25:02.249 --> 25:06.464
I was sleeping in that building. I didn't
care they was fixing up during the day.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.542
- Dust from the renovations.
- Full of lead.

25:08.719 --> 25:12.802
Didn't think I needed validation on this.
I called Medicine. They're admitting him.

25:12.976 --> 25:15.386
Have you seen Doug?
I've got that birthday boy in 1.

25:15.564 --> 25:18.236
The llama bite?
He's out talking to his dad.

25:18.403 --> 25:20.693
Probably he'll never come back.

25:21.033 --> 25:23.786
- Have you seen Benton?
- He wants you to check some patients.

25:23.954 --> 25:25.949
I can't right now.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.331
There's an arm lac in 6,
rule-out appendicitis in 3...

25:29.506 --> 25:34.255
...and Dr. Lewis wants to
talk about Angel. She split AMA.

25:34.431 --> 25:36.592
I can't deal with those right now, Jerry.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.140
Oh, man.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.001
- What the hell are you doing?
- They're wine coolers.

25:51.170 --> 25:54.506
They're really good.
You want some of mine?

25:56.847 --> 25:58.258
- I fell.
- You fell?

25:58.433 --> 26:00.094
Couldn't be because you're drunk?

26:00.269 --> 26:03.475
Hey, man, you leave her alone.
There's nothing wrong with her.

26:03.650 --> 26:05.194
- Get up!
- Nathan, make him stop.

26:05.487 --> 26:08.443
You're the ones that won't stop.
You're sick, and you get drunk.

26:08.618 --> 26:10.612
- You both rip out your IVs.
- That's enough.

26:10.788 --> 26:13.115
- What's the matter with you?
- Look what you did.

26:13.293 --> 26:15.417
Look what I did? Look what I did?!

26:15.588 --> 26:17.333
Carter, out of here. Out of here, now!

26:17.509 --> 26:20.880
Okay, you. Back in bed.
Haleh, help Angel out of here.

26:21.891 --> 26:24.895
Come on, back in bed. Now!

26:34.122 --> 26:35.997
- So, what's going on?
- You saw.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.828
No, not with them, with you.

26:40.091 --> 26:42.666
These people come in here
on drugs and booze.

26:42.846 --> 26:45.599
They don't listen to us,
and we're supposed to treat them.

26:45.767 --> 26:47.976
- We're supposed to treat them.
- What good is it?

26:48.147 --> 26:50.722
Tomorrow they're back on the street
doing the same thing.

26:50.902 --> 26:53.192
The day after that
they're gonna be back in here.

26:53.364 --> 26:55.442
That's the job.
If you don't like them needy-

26:55.618 --> 26:57.328
I don't like the abuse.

26:57.497 --> 27:02.043
- None of us do.
- You're used to it with your sister.

27:07.556 --> 27:10.726
When you first got here,
we were a little concerned about you.

27:10.896 --> 27:15.941
You seemed to care too much.
We're not worried about that anymore.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.365
What happened to you, Carter?

27:23.251 --> 27:25.744
- Loretta.
- Hi, Dr. Greene.

27:25.923 --> 27:28.213
How have you been?
We've been looking for you.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.258
- Jimmy was dying to see The Lion King.
- No, I wasn't.

27:31.432 --> 27:34.222
How about some ice cream?
I was just going on a break.

27:34.396 --> 27:36.806
- It's a little cold for ice cream.
- Hot chocolate?

27:38.361 --> 27:41.698
- I couldn't hear you.
- Thank you.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.992
- We need to talk.
- Exam 1?

27:44.581 --> 27:48.629
- Could you take Loretta to Exam 1?
- Sure.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.257
Thanks.

27:54.223 --> 27:56.431
- How did he do it?
- Playing soccer.

27:56.602 --> 28:00.057
- I thought you said he was 60.
- With his grandchildren.

28:00.234 --> 28:03.487
- That's a large joint effusion.
- I'll do an arthrocentesis.

28:03.657 --> 28:06.993
Tell him to stick to the sidelines.

28:07.163 --> 28:11.330
- Do you have another minute?
- Certainly.

28:11.504 --> 28:15.671
Dr. Vucelich is telling people
that I left the study.

28:15.845 --> 28:19.181
- I wasn't sure you'd want to talk.
- I didn't exactly leave.

28:19.351 --> 28:22.224
Carl's very discreet.

28:22.399 --> 28:25.687
He didn't think it would look good
that he had to fire his star pupil.

28:25.863 --> 28:27.524
Is that what he said?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.483
I believe the euphemism was,

28:29.854 --> 28:33.957
"We're experiencing a
difference in style."

28:34.128 --> 28:35.457
I'd have just fired you.

28:37.008 --> 28:41.472
Our differences had to do with the data,
who's left in and who's left out.

28:42.601 --> 28:44.311
That's a matter of interpretation.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.973
It's his research study.
He did get the grant...

28:47.151 --> 28:50.523
...on the strength of his reputation
and accomplishments.

28:50.699 --> 28:55.199
Do you know how much money
he brings into this hospital?

28:55.374 --> 28:57.867
If you've had a disagreement
with Vucelich...

28:58.046 --> 29:01.049
...I suggest you retreat immediately
and apologize.

29:01.218 --> 29:03.177
It wasn't a disagreement.

29:04.432 --> 29:09.228
Peter, you have the arrogance
of a great surgeon, the ego...

29:09.399 --> 29:11.192
...and someday, one hopes, the talent.

29:11.361 --> 29:16.656
But what you don't have is the ability to
get along, to be a member of the team.

29:17.664 --> 29:20.288
Once you're a Carl Vucelich,
you don't need that...

29:20.461 --> 29:23.749
...but you can't be
a Carl Vucelich without it.

29:26.722 --> 29:30.141
Here you go, Joseph.
I'll give your dad another call.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.772
Mark, you got a minute?

29:31.940 --> 29:33.898
- Someone check out that bite?
- It's okay...

29:34.068 --> 29:37.571
...but he needs someone to talk to. His
dad should have been here hours ago.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.736
Sure, in a few minutes.

29:44.504 --> 29:48.125
Please, sit down.
I have some difficult news.

29:48.302 --> 29:52.303
Yeah, I've been tired, but what
do you expect from an old hooker?

29:52.476 --> 29:56.608
New job's going great, kids are doing
well at school, everything is good.

29:59.865 --> 30:03.117
Your biopsy last time was positive
for cervical cancer.

30:04.331 --> 30:09.626
It's stage 1-B, which is relatively
early in the spread of the disease...

30:10.467 --> 30:15.465
...although that can only
be confirmed through surgery.

30:15.643 --> 30:19.311
Treatment is radical hysterectomy.

30:19.483 --> 30:22.106
The removal of the uterus and cervix.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.532
Sometimes radiation therapy is done.

30:31.755 --> 30:35.922
Statistics show that with treatment...

30:36.096 --> 30:39.468
...the five-year survival rate
is over 90%.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.183
Five years.

30:45.738 --> 30:48.278
My kids won't even be teenagers.

32:37.814 --> 32:40.104
Mr. Rubadoux...

32:40.277 --> 32:43.565
...I'm very sorry about your wife.

32:43.741 --> 32:45.700
I made a mistake.

32:45.870 --> 32:50.334
Not in the way I treated her,
but in the way I treated you.

32:51.839 --> 32:56.172
I wasn't honest. I wasn't fair.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.350
I was wrong.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.517
And I'm very, very sorry.

33:07.241 --> 33:10.695
This day isn't about you, Mr. Carter.

33:50.861 --> 33:53.650
- How's Angel?
- She's still asleep.

33:53.992 --> 33:58.704
- Are you kicking us out now?
- Not quite yet.

33:59.502 --> 34:03.918
Oh, God,
I've gotta stop this, you know?

34:04.135 --> 34:06.806
Angel's better at it.

34:06.973 --> 34:09.976
She can stop drinking for a while,
you know...

34:10.146 --> 34:14.146
...but then I just drag her right back in.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.480
I don't know why she stays.

34:19.329 --> 34:22.914
Nathan, there's something
that Angel's scared to tell you...

34:23.085 --> 34:27.502
...but it's something that I think you
have a right to know. She has AIDS.

34:28.344 --> 34:32.594
She has AIDS?
You mean the whole thing?

34:33.187 --> 34:35.429
Yes, which means you could have it too.

34:38.487 --> 34:42.536
Have you ever been tested?

34:42.704 --> 34:46.539
Could I have given it to her,
or could she have given it to me?

34:48.214 --> 34:51.382
If you test positive,
there's no way to know.

35:00.569 --> 35:03.608
- Loretta needs a little time.
- Is she going to have surgery?

35:03.783 --> 35:07.701
Yeah. She's just worried who's
gonna take her kids for five days.

35:07.874 --> 35:09.702
Al and I can take them.

35:09.877 --> 35:12.667
He thinks after we get married
we should adopt three or four.

35:12.841 --> 35:15.381
This'll get him off that kick.

35:16.097 --> 35:20.098
- Where have you been?
- The longest walk ever, and I'm freezing.

35:20.271 --> 35:22.942
- Start the margaritas in an hour.
- Mark, thank you...

35:23.109 --> 35:25.685
...and thank Susan,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

35:25.864 --> 35:28.868
- Things went that well with your dad?
- No, that was fine.

35:29.037 --> 35:31.446
Same old thing. He just wanted
to borrow 100 bucks.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.118
- Llama birthday boy is still here.
- What?

35:34.296 --> 35:37.750
The bite's been treated,
but his father is running late.

35:37.928 --> 35:41.798
Joseph? How's the arm?

35:41.977 --> 35:45.470
Did you know that you are my first...

35:45.771 --> 35:48.964
llama bite in my
entire pediatric career?

35:48.999 --> 35:53.450
Which makes this a special day. Also
because it happens to be my birthday.

35:53.622 --> 35:56.329
- I hate my birthday.
- Yeah, me too.

35:56.502 --> 36:00.503
- My dad's always late.
- So is mine.

36:00.677 --> 36:04.630
He gave me a trip to the zoo,
and then he didn't even come.

36:04.809 --> 36:09.689
- What did you get?
- I got a card.

36:09.860 --> 36:14.110
And I got two tickets
to the Bulls game.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.471
All right, get this.

36:21.967 --> 36:25.800
There are brownies in the
refrigerator in the lounge.

36:25.972 --> 36:29.011
They are not birthday cake,
and they are not mine.

36:29.186 --> 36:31.346
But I think we should steal them. Yeah?

36:31.523 --> 36:33.019
- Yep.
- Yep.

36:38.160 --> 36:42.244
Peter, I'm sorry
we couldn't meet in my office.

36:42.418 --> 36:46.585
I can't get rid of the endarterectomy
team from Philadelphia.

36:50.307 --> 36:53.346
I went over the charts again.
All of them.

36:54.773 --> 36:58.477
I can see spending a day thinking about
this hasn't helped, so stop right here.

36:58.655 --> 37:02.323
- Agree to disagree, and move on.
- Apparently I already have.

37:02.496 --> 37:05.368
I didn't fire you.
I just let people know that you quit.

37:05.543 --> 37:08.036
Which I hadn't.

37:08.214 --> 37:11.716
I felt you needed help
making that decision.

37:11.887 --> 37:14.725
I don't understand.
At least three of those patients...

37:14.893 --> 37:17.896
...should not have been excluded
from the study.

37:18.065 --> 37:23.740
- I determine who's in and who's out.
- I thought the protocol determined that.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.162
If you're manipulating the data,
how can the study be valid?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.622
How dare you question me?

37:29.794 --> 37:31.670
You get the opportunity of a lifetime...

37:31.840 --> 37:34.380
...and you have the temerity
to challenge my reputation.

37:34.553 --> 37:37.307
The results won't be accurate.
Aren't lives at stake here?

37:37.475 --> 37:40.348
Yes, Peter, lives are at stake.
Lives that I save.

37:40.522 --> 37:43.858
Mothers, fathers, grandparents
are living because I made choices.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.866
I risked everything
to do what I know is right.

37:48.202 --> 37:51.455
- The rules are there for a reason.
- Grow up, Peter.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.334
You're no junior chemist at the FDA.

37:53.503 --> 37:56.257
You're a surgical Resident
in a struggling county hospital.

37:56.425 --> 37:58.669
How do you think money
comes into this place?

37:58.846 --> 38:02.799
It takes more than "please"
and "I promise to do what's right. "

38:02.979 --> 38:07.194
It takes results. And that, at any cost,
is what I produce.

38:07.362 --> 38:09.985
Now, you screw with that...

38:10.158 --> 38:13.993
...and you will be off surgical service
for a hell of a lot longer than one day.

38:30.361 --> 38:34.528
Boy, when they made you stupid,
they made you really stupid.

38:36.455 --> 38:39.328
That's the only funny thing
I've heard all day.

38:42.466 --> 38:45.635
I'm gonna die, and you're gonna tell me
I should give these up?

38:45.805 --> 38:50.222
The cold's doing more damage.
You do have pneumonia.

38:52.317 --> 38:54.276
Maybe quicker is better.

38:57.451 --> 38:58.733
I told Nathan.

39:02.210 --> 39:05.961
I know it's illegal, but I did it anyway.
He's really worried about you.

39:06.676 --> 39:09.465
He's worried that maybe
he gave it to you.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.726
He wants to go through this together.

39:15.358 --> 39:18.361
Yeah, sure. If he has it.

39:19.950 --> 39:23.618
But if...
If he's clean, and I'm sick...

39:26.002 --> 39:29.706
- ... why's he gonna wanna stick around?
- Which option are you hoping for?

39:39.359 --> 39:41.603
It's cold out here.

39:44.911 --> 39:47.582
I'm gonna go inside.

39:55.639 --> 39:58.179
Sorry about this.
The dean's staff meetings...

39:58.352 --> 40:00.679
...usually don't take this long.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.566
It's okay.

40:02.735 --> 40:06.570
- Does the dean know what it's about?
- No, he doesn't.

40:12.085 --> 40:14.459
Yes?

40:14.631 --> 40:16.755
Of course.

40:19.097 --> 40:22.516
It'll just be another minute or two.

40:49.276 --> 40:51.948
I don't know. I just think
I've turned into a cliché.

40:52.115 --> 40:53.574
Don't do this, Mark.

40:53.742 --> 40:57.993
I've got that "guy about to be divorced"
look all over me.

40:58.167 --> 41:01.621
Here I am in a very attractive
single woman's apartment...

41:01.799 --> 41:04.374
...drinking like
I'm still in my 20s...

41:04.553 --> 41:07.093
...with a brand-new, used motorcycle.

41:08.936 --> 41:12.522
- You are a guy about to be divorced.
- But I don't have to act like one.

41:12.693 --> 41:14.937
Here, try this.

41:17.410 --> 41:19.700
Not as good as the first,
better than the second.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.371
Does it matter? People at work are
making up stories about you anyway.

41:24.548 --> 41:26.838
About us, you mean.

41:27.010 --> 41:31.094
Yeah. And what is that, can I ask you?

41:31.268 --> 41:34.556
My car's in the shop.
I drop Susie off at my parents'.

41:34.732 --> 41:36.608
Meet up with you
to go tequila shopping...

41:36.778 --> 41:40.196
...and all of a sudden,
we're having a torrid affair.

41:40.368 --> 41:42.409
Who said it was torrid?

41:42.580 --> 41:46.497
No one.
I'm just assuming it would be.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.627
- That's not what I meant.
- That's okay. I know what you meant.

41:50.594 --> 41:52.885
I'm sure it would be too.

41:54.017 --> 41:56.142
Why wouldn't it be?

41:57.356 --> 41:58.982
No reason at all.

42:05.245 --> 42:08.284
There's not enough lime in this.

42:15.848 --> 42:18.388
- Hey, bro.
- What's up, Walt?

42:18.561 --> 42:21.600
Same old thing.

42:21.775 --> 42:25.361
What happened? You look like
you lost your tenth patient.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.367
I don't know, man.

42:34.214 --> 42:35.923
I don't know.

42:40.767 --> 42:44.554
- I'm off the study I told you about.
- I thought the main man loved you.

42:44.733 --> 42:48.568
Yeah, well, he was breaking some rules,
and I called him on it.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.862
- Were you right?
- I just thought it'd be different.

42:52.830 --> 42:55.537
The work we were doing,
where I was going...

42:55.711 --> 43:00.091
- Different from what?
- From everything that got me here.

43:00.260 --> 43:05.425
Scratching my way through med school.
Playing this game and that game.

43:05.603 --> 43:09.224
You angle for the best Residency
no matter what.

43:13.576 --> 43:16.116
You did what you had to do.

43:17.416 --> 43:20.704
- What we all have to do every day.
- Why do we keep on doing it?

43:21.465 --> 43:25.632
That's up to you. The world doesn't
change because you're moving up in it.

43:31.692 --> 43:37.402
I went to the dean to tell him
what was going on.

43:37.577 --> 43:41.530
And I waited around for 20 minutes,
and I left.

43:46.051 --> 43:47.926
I just left.

43:49.056 --> 43:53.556
I'm stupid enough to ruin my career,
but I don't even have the...

43:55.150 --> 44:00.279
...courage to do it the right way.

44:09.259 --> 44:12.215
You don't understand, Walt.

44:12.389 --> 44:15.642
I always thought when the time came...

44:16.981 --> 44:20.733
...I'd do the right thing.

44:21.305 --> 44:27.244
