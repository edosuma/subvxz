WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:15.815
We go further, so you can.
>> AT THE NATIONWIDE LEVEL, THE
NUMBER OF AMERICANS QUITTING
THEIR JOB IS HIGHER THAN EVER.

00:15.882 --> 00:24.190
>> DO THE DATA TELL YOU WHY?
>> WE CAN SEE WHAT SECTORS
PEOPLE ARE QUITTING-- RETAIL
SECTORS AND HOSPITALITY SECTORS.

00:24.257 --> 00:29.229
IT MAY NOT JUST BE WORTH IT FOR
SOME FOLKS.
AND SO, S-- IN SOME CASES,
PEOPLE ARE QUITTING, AND THEY'RE

00:29.295 --> 00:34.267
NOT YET RETURNING.
THEY'RE TAKING A BREAK.
AMERICANS ARE BURNT OUT.
>> SO, WHAT IS THE U.S.

00:34.334 --> 00:41.007
WORKFORCE LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE IN
THE NEAR FUTURE?
THAT'S OUR STORY, TONIGHT.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

00:41.074 --> 00:49.015
>> I'M HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT,
"I WANT TO BE A PART OF A BETTER
WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR
GRANDCHILDREN."

00:49.082 --> 00:53.052
>> YEAH.
I CAN'T SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD,
BUT I CAN DO MY PART.
>> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU PUT

00:53.119 --> 01:00.293
AMERICANS FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM ACROSS
FROM ONE ANOTHER, AND ASKED THEM
TO TALK?

01:00.360 --> 01:05.999
HAVE A LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED
"ONE SMALL STEP."
>> PEOPLE FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD AND
JUDGED.

01:06.065 --> 01:13.072
YOU KNOW, NOBODY HAS EVER, IN
THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY,
NOBODY'S EVER CHANGED THEIR MIND
BECAUSE-- BY BEING CALLED AN

01:13.139 --> 01:20.380
IDIOT OR A MORON OR A SNOWFLAKE.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> IF IT'S NOT THE LEAST
GLAMOROUS JOB IN THE N.F.L., IT

01:20.447 --> 01:27.153
MAY BE THE MOST STRESSFUL.
WE SPEAK OF THE KICKER.
THEY ARE NOT THE BIGGEST OR BEST
ATHLETES ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD,

01:27.220 --> 01:33.059
BUT THEY SCORE ABOUT A THIRD OF
ALL POINTS.
SO, WITH THE N.F.L. PLAYOFFS ON
OUR DOORSTEP, WE THOUGHT IT

01:33.126 --> 01:38.097
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO GET
INSIDE THE QUIRKY MINDS OF THE
GUYS WHO BOOT THE BALL-- END
OVER END, WITH TIME RUNNING OUT-

01:38.164 --> 01:44.037
- UP AND OVER THE BAR.
>> IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING JUST,
LIKE, A LITTLE SOMETHING, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU EVEN REALLY

01:44.103 --> 01:47.106
LIVING?
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:48.141 --> 01:51.878
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.

01:51.945 --> 01:57.050
>> I'M NORAH O'DONNELL.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

01:57.116 --> 02:09.963
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Lesley Stahl: WE'VE ALL SEEN
SIGNS IN FRONT OF SHOPS,
RESTAURANTS, AND FACTORIES:

02:10.029 --> 02:19.772
"WE'RE HIRING!" "HELP WANTED!"
AND NOW, THE OMICRON VARIANT IS
TAKING A TOLL ON THE ALREADY-
DEPLETED WORKFORCE.

02:19.839 --> 02:28.681
WE'VE WONDERED HOW THERE CAN BE
SO MANY OPEN JOBS WHEN NEARLY
EVERY EMPLOYER SEEMS TO BE
OFFERING BETTER PAY, BENEFITS,

02:28.748 --> 02:37.857
AND EVEN SIGNING BONUSES.
THE GOVERNMENT'S JOBS REPORT,
RELEASED THIS PAST WEEK, TELLS
US WHAT HAS HAPPENED: WELL OVER

02:37.924 --> 02:45.865
20 MILLION PEOPLE QUIT THEIR
JOBS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2021.
SOME ARE CALLING IT THE "BIG
QUIT," OTHERS, THE "GREAT

02:45.932 --> 02:53.540
RESIGNATION."
BUT, WHO CAN EXPLAIN<i> WHY</i> THIS IS
HAPPENING?
BILL WHITAKER REPORTS.

02:53.606 --> 03:01.915
HE FOUND THE BEST PLACE TO LOOK
FOR REAL-TIME ANSWERS IS THE
HUGE ONLINE JOB SITE LINKEDIN,
WHICH CALLS ITSELF THE WORLD'S

03:01.981 --> 03:12.859
LARGEST PROFESSIONAL NETWORK.
>> Karin Kimbrough: PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN LIVING TO WORK FOR A VERY
LONG TIME, AND I THINK THE

03:12.926 --> 03:17.931
PANDEMIC BROUGHT THAT MOMENT OF
REFLECTION FOR EVERYONE.
"WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?
WHAT MAKES MY HEART SING?"

03:17.997 --> 03:25.772
AND PEOPLE ARE THINKING, "IF NOT
NOW, THEN WHEN?"
>> Whitaker: KARIN KIMBROUGH IS
LINKEDIN'S CHIEF ECONOMIST.

03:25.838 --> 03:32.245
SHE HAS DEGREES FROM STANFORD
AND HARVARD AND A Ph.D. FROM
OXFORD, USED TO WORK FOR THE
FEDERAL RESERVE, AND NOW HAS A

03:32.312 --> 03:40.019
BIRDS-EYE VIEW OF THE U.S.
LABOR MARKET.
>> Kimbrough: WE HAVE THIS
UNIQUE VIEW OF THE DATA.

03:40.086 --> 03:47.393
WE CAN SEE ACROSS MILLIONS OF
MEMBERS AND WHAT THEY SHARE WITH
US, AND WE CAN SEE FROM
EMPLOYERS, MILLIONS OF THEM THAT

03:47.460 --> 03:52.765
ARE POSTING JOBS ON OUR
PLATFORM.
THERE IS ONE PERSON HIRED EVERY
15 SECONDS RIGHT NOW ON

03:52.832 --> 04:01.007
LINKEDIN.
>> Whitaker: BUT LINKEDIN'S DATA
ON WHO IS LEAVING JOBS IS MOST
COMPELLING: MILLIONS OF BABY

04:01.074 --> 04:08.881
BOOMERS RETIRING EARLY, BUT ALSO
MILLIONS OF "GEN Z"
WORKERS-- PEOPLE IN THEIR TEENS
AND EARLY 20s.

04:08.948 --> 04:15.788
MANY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN.
IN ALL, THE HIGHEST "QUIT RATE"
SINCE THE GOVERNMENT STARTED
KEEPING TRACK, TWO DECADES AGO.

04:15.855 --> 04:20.126
>> Kimbrough: AT THE NATIONWIDE
LEVEL, THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS
QUITTING THEIR JOB IS HIGHER
THAN EVER.

04:20.193 --> 04:24.831
>> Whitaker: HIGHER THAN EVER?
>> Kimbrough: HIGHER THAN EVER.
>> Whitaker: DO THE DATA TELL
YOU WHY?

04:24.897 --> 04:32.572
>> Kimbrough: WE CAN SEE WHAT
SECTORS PEOPLE ARE QUITTING--
RETAIL SECTORS AND HOSPITALITY
SECTORS.

04:32.639 --> 04:38.611
IT MAY NOT JUST BE WORTH IT FOR
SOME FOLKS.
AND SO, S-- IN SOME CASES,
PEOPLE ARE QUITTING, AND THEY'RE

04:38.678 --> 04:42.382
NOT YET RETURNING.
THEY'RE TAKING A BREAK.
AMERICANS ARE BURNT OUT.
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS-- IT'S

04:42.448 --> 04:45.985
A, "TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT"
MEASURE.
IT'S JUST A SIGN OF PEOPLE
SAYING, "YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED

04:46.052 --> 04:50.323
THIS."
>> Whitaker: "I'M OUT."
>> Kimbrough: "I'M OUT."
>> Whitaker: THE MOST RECENT

04:50.390 --> 05:02.068
DATA SHOW PEOPLE QUITTING JOBS
ACROSS THE BOARD: 4.4% OF ALL
POSITIONS IN EDUCATION ARE OPEN,
OVER 6% IN RETAIL, AND MORE THAN

05:02.135 --> 05:07.006
8% IN HEALTH CARE.
OPEN JOBS IN HOTELS AND
RESTAURANTS ARE NEARLY 9%.
THAT'S ALMOST 1.5 MILLION VACANT

05:07.073 --> 05:15.815
POSITIONS.
>> Carl Sobocinski: WE DO HAVE
OPENINGS, AND WE DO NEED MORE
EMPLOYEES.

05:15.882 --> 05:20.853
>> Whitaker: CARL SOBOCINSKI
OWNS SEVERAL RESTAURANTS IN
GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA.
HE NEEDS WORKERS BOTH IN THE

05:20.920 --> 05:28.861
KITCHEN AND OUT FRONT WAITING
TABLES.
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN-
- IN ATTRACTING THEM AND--

05:28.928 --> 05:34.067
KEEPING THE EMPLOYEES?
>> Sobocinski: IT'S A PROBLEM
THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT OUT THERE.
WHERE WE ARE, WE JUST DON'T HAVE

05:34.133 --> 05:38.271
THE WORKERS OUT THERE LOOKING
FOR THE JOBS.
>> Whitaker: CONSTRUCTION IS
ANOTHER SECTOR WITHOUT ENOUGH

05:38.337 --> 05:46.879
WORKERS.
AT LAST COUNT, THERE WERE NEARLY
350,000 OPEN CONSTRUCTION JOBS
NATIONWIDE.

05:46.946 --> 05:51.050
YOU'RE FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT
TO FIND PEOPLE RIGHT NOW--
>> James Jordon: ABSOLUTELY.
>> Whitaker: --ACROSS THE BOARD?

05:51.117 --> 05:56.155
>> Jordon: ACROSS THE BOARD.
>> Whitaker: JAMES JORDON OWNS A
FAST-GROWING CONSTRUCTION
COMPANY IN GREENVILLE.

05:56.222 --> 06:03.696
>> Jordon: WE DOUBLED OUR
REVENUE YEAR OVER YEAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A WORK PROBLEM AT
ALL.

06:03.763 --> 06:09.669
NOW, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
FINDING THE INDIVIDUALS TO BE
ABLE TO DO-- PERFORM THE WORK.
>> Whitaker: SO IT'S NOT A WORK

06:09.736 --> 06:14.907
PROBLEM, IT'S A WORKER PROBLEM?
>> Jordon: IT'S A WORKER
PROBLEM.
>> Whitaker: WE CAME TO

06:14.974 --> 06:21.114
GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA AFTER
SEEING IT ON A LINKEDIN DATA MAP
SHOWING TRENDS OF GEOGRAPHIC
MIGRATION.

06:21.180 --> 06:28.554
LOTS OF WORKERS LEAVING BIG
CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND
CHICAGO, AND LOTS OF WORKERS
MOVING TO PLACES LIKE AUSTIN AND

06:28.621 --> 06:37.330
MIAMI, AND GREENVILLE.
THAT'S ANOTHER BIG SIGN OF THIS
JOB MARKET.
PEOPLE ARE MOVING.

06:37.396 --> 06:46.139
>> Kimbrough: A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE JUST OPTING, BECAUSE OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS, TO
CHOOSE MORE AFFORDABLE PLACES,

06:46.205 --> 06:57.016
SMALLER CITIES THAT GIVE YOU
MORE SPACE, WILL FEEL SAFER.
AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO TRY
SOMETHING NEW.

06:57.083 --> 07:02.188
>> Whitaker: FOR WHAT YOU'D PAY
TO RENT AN APARTMENT IN SAN
FRANCISCO, YOU CAN BUY A NICE
HOUSE IN GREENVILLE.

07:02.255 --> 07:10.196
IT HAS ATTRACTED BIG EMPLOYERS
LIKE BMW AND MICHELIN, BUT ALSO
TRIES TO NURTURE SMALL
BUSINESSES AND START-UPS.

07:10.263 --> 07:17.003
STILL, YOU SEE ALL THE SAME
"HELP WANTED" SIGNS ON
GREENVILLE'S MAIN STREET AS YOU
WOULD IN ANY BIG CITY.

07:17.069 --> 07:24.043
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT
GENEROUS GOVERNMENT STIMULUS AND
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE REALLY
WHAT'S KEEPING SO MANY WORKERS

07:24.110 --> 07:30.449
ON THE SIDELINES-- NO MATTER
WHERE THEY LIVE.
>> Sobocinski: THE QUICK ANSWER
PEOPLE SAY IS, WE'RE STILL

07:30.516 --> 07:37.256
PROVIDING TOO MANY BENEFITS, AND
TOO MANY PEOPLE CAN SIT AT HOME
AND-- AND GET A CHECK.
I PERSONALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT.

07:37.323 --> 07:42.195
OUR ASSOCIATES THAT DIDN'T COME
BACK?
THEY'RE NOT SITTING AT HOME.
THEY FOUND OTHER CAREERS, OTHER

07:42.261 --> 07:50.203
OPPORTUNITIES, THAT FIT THEIR
LIFESTYLE BETTER.
>> Kimbrough: WHAT WE SAW WAS
THAT, WHEN THESE BENEFITS WERE

07:50.269 --> 07:57.577
TURNED OFF, WHEN WORKERS WERE NO
LONGER GETTING THE BENEFITS,
THEY DID NOT RUSH BACK TO WORK.
>> Whitaker: WHAT DOES THAT TELL

07:57.643 --> 08:02.281
YOU?
>> Kimbrough: THAT TELLS ME THAT
IT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF THE
BENEFITS.

08:02.348 --> 08:10.089
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT'S
GOING ON IN THE HEADS OF WORKERS
WHEN THEY MAKE THAT CALCULUS
ABOUT, "SHOULD I GO BACK, WILL I

08:10.156 --> 08:21.400
GO BACK, AND FOR WHAT JOB?"
>> Whitaker: SO, IS ALL OF THIS
PRODUCING A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN
THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN

08:21.467 --> 08:27.340
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES?
>> Kimbrough: IT'S AS IF THAT
SOCIAL CONTRACT OF WORK IS BEING
REWRITTEN, AND RIGHT NOW, THE

08:27.406 --> 08:38.251
WORKER'S HOLDING THE PEN.
THERE ARE JUST THOUSANDS UPON
THOUSANDS OF AVAILABLE JOBS IN
AMERICA RIGHT NOW, AND COMPANIES

08:38.317 --> 08:48.261
ARE EAGER TO HIRE-- BUT WORKERS
ARE BEING VERY CHOOSY.
>> Whitaker: SO, EMPLOYEES ARE
KIND OF IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT?

08:48.327 --> 08:53.099
>> Kimbrough: EMPLOYEES ARE IN
THE DRIVER'S SEAT RIGHT NOW.
>> Whitaker: WORKERS WANT BETTER
PAY AND BENEFITS, OF COURSE, BUT

08:53.165 --> 09:02.341
THEY'RE ALSO DEMANDING AUTONOMY
AND FLEXIBILITY, PARTICULARLY IN
THEIR WORK SCHEDULES.
AND EMPLOYERS, LARGE AND SMALL,

09:02.408 --> 09:08.614
SIMPLY HAVE TO RESPOND.
>> Sobocinski: I THINK
FLEXIBILITY'S CRITICAL.
>> Whitaker: THIS IS THE

09:08.681 --> 09:11.717
EMPLOYEES' DEMAND.
>> Sobocinski: THE EMPLOYEES,
THEY WANT FLEXIBILITY.
AND IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER THAT

09:11.784 --> 09:17.323
WON'T-- THAT WON'T WORK WITH
YOUR EMPLOYEES, TO-- TO BE
FLEXIBLE WITH THEM, THEN YOU'RE
GOING TO BE-- YOU'RE MISSING

09:17.390 --> 09:22.428
OUT.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO.
>> Whitaker: SO, IS IT THE CASE
THAT, GONE ARE THE DAYS WHERE AN

09:22.495 --> 09:29.001
EMPLOYER WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE JUST
LUCKY TO HAVE THIS JOB"?
>> Jordon: I-- I THINK SO.
I THINK SO, AND I THINK IT'S FOR

09:29.068 --> 09:34.840
THE BETTER.
>> Whitaker: JAMES JORDON'S
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WILL PAY AN
EMPLOYEE'S TUITION IF THEY WANT

09:34.907 --> 09:41.180
TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION...
>> Jordon: PERFECT TIMING!
COME ON IN.
>> Whitaker: ...AND THEIR MOVING

09:41.247 --> 09:48.888
EXPENSES, IF THEY RELOCATE.
AND, LIKE SO MANY EMPLOYERS,
HE'S OFFERING SIGNING BONUSES
AND FLEXIBLE HOURS TO NEW HIRES.

09:48.955 --> 09:56.862
I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS ONE YOUNG
MAN, ONE YOUNG RECRUIT, THAT YOU
CALLED EVERY DAY FOR TWO MONTHS?
>> Jordon: I DID!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.531
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Whitaker: (<i> LAUGHS</i> )
YOU REALLY WANTED THIS YOUNG
MAN--

09:58.597 --> 10:00.866
>> Jordon: I DID.
I DID.
>> Whitaker: DID YOU FINALLY GET
HIM?

10:00.933 --> 10:06.339
>> Jordon: I FINALLY GOT HIM.
HE STARTED LAST WEEK, MONDAY.
>> Whitaker: WHAT A STUNNING
TURNAROUND FROM THE SPRING OF

10:06.405 --> 10:12.845
2020, WHEN THE PANDEMIC
ESSENTIALLY SHUT THE ECONOMY
DOWN.
>> Kimbrough: WE HAD NEVER SEEN

10:12.912 --> 10:20.486
ANYTHING LIKE IT.
WHEN YOU LOSE 22 MILLION JOBS IN
JUST TWO MONTHS?
AND, IT'S UNTHINKABLE.

10:20.553 --> 10:26.759
>> Whitaker: KIMBROUGH REMEMBERS
THAT WORKING MOTHERS WERE-- AND
STILL ARE-- AMONG THOSE HARDEST
HIT, AS THE PANDEMIC ROBBED THEM

10:26.826 --> 10:32.631
OF MANY OF THEIR CHILD-CARE
OPTIONS.
>> Kimbrough: WHAT WE'RE SEEING
NOW IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT

10:32.698 --> 10:36.235
STORY OF RESILIENCE.
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING MORE AND
MORE WOMEN COME BACK INTO THE
WORKFORCE.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.506
WE'RE STILL MISSING A FEW
MILLION WOMEN, BY THE WAY, IN
THE WORKFORCE.
WE'RE NOT FULLY THERE.

10:40.573 --> 10:45.611
>> Whitaker: STILL?
>> Kimbrough: STILL MISSING A
FEW MILLION WOMEN.
BUT WE'RE SEEING THEM COME BACK.

10:45.678 --> 10:50.850
AND PREDOMINANTLY, THE WOMEN
THAT WERE MISSING ARE PARENTS OF
YOUNG CHILDREN.
THEY WERE HIT THE HARDEST.

10:50.916 --> 10:55.654
>> Melissa Williams: I JUST
DECIDED TO LEAVE.
I HAD NOWHERE TO GO.
I HAD NO HOPES FOR EMPLOYMENT.

10:55.721 --> 11:01.327
LUCKILY, MY HUSBAND WAS
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED, AND I WAS
ABLE TO DO THAT.
BUT, I JUST WALKED AWAY.

11:01.394 --> 11:08.467
>> Whitaker: MELISSA WILLIAMS
WALKED AWAY FROM A MARKETING JOB
IN GREENVILLE IN EARLY 2021.
WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT, SHE WAS

11:08.534 --> 11:13.272
BALANCING MARRIAGE, MOTHERHOOD,
AND HER CAREER.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PART OF A
TREND.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.441
>> Williams: YES.
>> Whitaker: THERE'S, LIKE, A
FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT--
>> Williams: THE GREAT

11:15.508 --> 11:20.112
RESIGNATION.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Whitaker: PEOPLE WHO ARE
SAYING AND DOING WHAT YOU DID.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.949
"I-- I-- I CAN DO BETTER THAN
THIS.
THIS ISN'T-- THIS ISN'T FUN.
THIS ISN'T ME."

11:24.016 --> 11:27.887
>> Williams: LIKE YOU SAID, I
HIT A WALL, AND I WAS DONE.
>> Whitaker: WAS THAT DIFFICULT?
I MEAN--

11:27.953 --> 11:31.724
>> Williams: IT WAS.
IT WAS VERY SCARY.
BECAUSE I HAD-- I'VE BEEN
EMPLOYED SINCE I WAS 17 YEARS

11:31.791 --> 11:38.197
OLD.
I REMEMBER GOING HOME AFTER I
PUT IN MY RESIGNATION AND-- AND
I JUST SAT THERE ON THE COUCH

11:38.264 --> 11:42.334
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DID I JUST
DO?
I JUST QUIT MY JOB.
I HAVE NO JOB TO GO TO.

11:42.401 --> 11:46.872
WE HAVE BILLS.
WE HAVE A CHILD.
WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES."
AND MY HUSBAND'S LIKE, "YOU WANT

11:46.939 --> 11:51.377
TO GO FOR A WALK?"
IT'S LIKE, "WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO!"
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

11:51.444 --> 11:58.384
SO WE WENT FOR A WALK.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Kenzie Biggins: IT IS
CHALLENGING TO GO SAY, "I'M

11:58.451 --> 12:05.291
GOING TO GO OUT ON MY OWN,"
IN GENERAL.
IT REALLY DOES TAKE SOME WORK.
BUT PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE CONTROL.

12:05.357 --> 12:14.467
>> Whitaker: KENZIE BIGGINS
MOVED TO GREENVILLE IN 2017, A
FEW YEARS AFTER SHE FOUNDED
WORXBEE, WHICH PAIRS REMOTE

12:14.533 --> 12:22.475
ASSISTANTS WITH EXECUTIVES AND
COMPANIES THAT NEED
ADMINISTRATIVE HELP.
YOU FIND EXECUTIVE ASSISTANTS

12:22.541 --> 12:27.746
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND YOU
TEAM THEM UP WITH EXECUTIVES AND
COMPANIES ALSO ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY?

12:27.813 --> 12:31.750
>> Biggins: YES.
>> Whitaker: SO ONE CAN BE IN
GREENVILLE, AND AN EXECUTIVE CAN
BE IN CHICAGO.

12:31.817 --> 12:37.556
>> Biggins: YEAH.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BEST PAIRING
FOR YOU.
>> Whitaker: KENZIE HAD THE IDEA

12:37.623 --> 12:43.095
FOR WORXBEE YEARS BEFORE THE
PANDEMIC MADE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS
COMMON.
YOU WERE AHEAD OF THE CURVE, AND

12:43.162 --> 12:48.300
THEN THE CURVE CAUGHT UP.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Biggins: LET ME JUST SAY
THIS, I GOT A LOT OF CRAZY LOOKS

12:48.367 --> 12:54.440
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, YOU KNOW,
WALKING INTO PLACES AND SAYING,
"YOU SHOULD HAVE A VIRTUAL
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT."

12:54.507 --> 12:58.277
PEOPLE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I HAD
FIVE HEADS.
THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT?"
>> Whitaker: PANDEMIC HITS, AND

12:58.344 --> 13:04.683
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE A
GENIUS.
>> Biggins: WE WENT FROM CLOSING
THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE A MONTH, TO

13:04.750 --> 13:11.056
CLOSING TEN TO 18 PEOPLE PER
MONTH, WHICH IS QUITE THE JUMP!
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
IN TRYING TO GET PEOPLE PAIRED,

13:11.123 --> 13:16.996
AND BRING IN NEW E.A.s.
>> Kimbrough: AMERICANS HAVE
REALLY TAKEN A LIKING TO REMOTE
WORK.

13:17.062 --> 13:21.400
THEY'RE 2.5 TIMES AS LIKELY TO
APPLY TO A JOB THAT'S REMOTE
VERSUS A JOB THAT'S NOT REMOTE.
>> Whitaker: HOW'S THAT

13:21.467 --> 13:30.576
DIFFERENT FROM PRE-PANDEMIC?
>> Kimbrough: SO, PRE-PANDEMIC,
I THINK ONE IN EVERY 67 JOBS WAS
A REMOTE JOB.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.747
>> Whitaker: AND NOW?
>> Kimbrough: AND NOW IT'S ONE
IN SEVEN.
>> Whitaker: ONE IN SEVEN?

13:34.813 --> 13:37.183
>> Kimbrough: ONE IN SEVEN JOBS
IS REMOTE NOW.
IT'S HUGE--
>> Whitaker: THAT'S A HUGE

13:37.249 --> 13:44.256
SHIFT.
>> Kimbrough: HUGE RISE IN M--
AND I THINK WHAT IT IS, IS THAT
COMPANIES HAVE REALIZED THAT IF

13:44.323 --> 13:47.359
THEY WANT TO ATTRACT CANDIDATES,
THEY KIND OF NEED TO MEET THEM
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.
>> Williams: WORXBEE FOUND ME AT

13:47.426 --> 13:55.801
THE MOST OPPORTUNE TIME.
>> Whitaker: TWO MONTHS AFTER
QUITTING HER OFFICE JOB, MELISSA
STARTED WITH WORXBEE.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.004
>> Williams: THE CHURN RATE IS
FINALLY SHOWING ITS STRIPES.
SO, HALLELUJAH!
>> Whitaker: SHE'S NOW AN

13:59.071 --> 14:05.177
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT FOR THREE
ORGANIZATIONS.
YOU'RE WORKING FOR THREE
DIFFERENT BOSSES--

14:05.244 --> 14:06.879
>> Williams: YES.
UH-HUH.
>> Whitaker: FROM HOME.
>> Williams: UH-HUH.

14:06.946 --> 14:10.516
>> Whitaker: ALL VIRTUALLY.
>> Williams: YES.
>> Whitaker: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
COULD BE JUST AS BUSY AS YOU

14:10.583 --> 14:17.423
WERE BEFORE.
>> Williams: I AM.
I AM JUST AS BUSY.
THE DIFFERENCE IS, IT'S MY

14:17.489 --> 14:20.125
CHOICE.
>> Whitaker: NOW YOU HAVE A
FOURTH JOB?
>> Williams: I DO.

14:20.192 --> 14:26.765
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
I DO.
I AM ALSO AN ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR
AT GREENVILLE TECHNICAL COLLEGE.

14:26.832 --> 14:34.607
>> Whitaker: WORXBEE, AND THE
ABILITY TO DESIGN YOUR WORK
LIFE, DOES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO NOW ENJOY WHAT SEEMS

14:34.673 --> 14:38.944
TO BE YOUR PASSION?
>> Williams: ABSOLUTELY.
>> Whitaker: TO TEACH ENGLISH.
>> Williams: ABSOLUTELY.

14:39.011 --> 14:46.418
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR WORXBEE,
I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
EVEN GIVE THIS A SHOT.
>> Whitaker: THE PENDULUM OF

14:46.485 --> 14:53.459
POWER MAY SOON SWING BACK TOWARD
EMPLOYERS, ESPECIALLY AS WORKERS
WHO'VE QUIT THEIR JOBS DEPLETE
THEIR SAVINGS.

14:53.525 --> 15:02.234
BUT KARIN KIMBROUGH EXPECTS
EMPLOYEES TO CLING TO THE
FLEXIBILITY THEY'VE FOUGHT FOR.
>> Kimbrough: I THINK ACTUALLY

15:02.301 --> 15:08.007
THAT THIS TREND TOWARDS HAVING
MORE FLEXIBILITY COULD BE
PERMANENT.
>> Williams: I HONESTLY CAN SAY

15:08.073 --> 15:10.276
I DON'T SEE MYSELF GOING BACK TO
AN OFFICE, EVER.
AND THAT--
>> Whitaker: EVER?

15:10.342 --> 15:15.414
>> Williams: EVER.
HONESTLY, THERE IS NO OFFICE
THAT COULD OFFER ME WHAT I HAVE
IN MY HOUSE.

15:15.481 --> 15:30.362
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Norah O'Donnell: THIS PAST
THURSDAY MARKED THE FIRST

15:30.429 --> 15:38.370
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTACK ON THE
U.S. CAPITOL, WHEN AN ANGRY MOB
TRIED AND FAILED TO STOP
CONGRESS FROM CERTIFYING THE

15:38.437 --> 15:44.009
2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
THE INSURRECTION'S ONLY SUCCESS
WAS TO FURTHER POLARIZE A
COUNTRY ALREADY DIVIDED.

15:44.076 --> 15:50.382
TONIGHT, WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO
SOMEONE ATTEMPTING TO BRIDGE
THAT DIVIDE.
DAVE ISAY HAS CRETED A PROGRAM

15:50.449 --> 15:57.256
CALLED "ONE SMALL STEP" TO GT
AMERICANS FROM ACROSS THE
POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO STOP
DEMONIZING ONE ANOTHER AND START

15:57.323 --> 16:06.432
COMMUNICATING-- FACE TO FACE,
ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME.
"ONE SMALL STEP" GREW OUT OF
"STORYCORPS," THE ORAL HISTORY

16:06.498 --> 16:12.838
PROJECT DAVE ISAY FOUNDED 18
YEARS AGO.
IT HAS TAPED MORE THAN HALF A
MILLION AMERICANS TELLING THEIR

16:12.905 --> 16:21.313
STORIES, TO BECOME THE LARGEST
SINGLE COLLECTION OF HUMAN
VOICES EVER RECORDED-- WITH ONE
AIM AT ITS CORE.

16:21.380 --> 16:26.452
>> Dave Isay: WHAT IF WE JUST
GIVE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THE
CHANCE TO BE LISTENED TO AND
HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT, YOU

16:26.518 --> 16:31.924
KNOW, WHO THEY ARE?
>> O'Donnell: DO YOU THINK PART
OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING IN
AMERICA IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SO

16:31.990 --> 16:34.460
ANGRY BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL
LIKE ANYBODY'S LISTENING TO
THEM?
>> Isay: YEAH.

16:34.526 --> 16:42.234
I THINK PEOPLE FEEL-- PEOPLE
FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD AND JUDGED
AND UNHEARD.
YOU KNOW, NOBODY HAS EVER, IN

16:42.301 --> 16:45.838
THE-- IN THE HISTORY OF
HUMANITY, NO-- NOBODY'S EVER
CHANGED THEIR MIND BECAUSE-- BY
BEING CALLED AN IDIOT OR A MORON

16:45.904 --> 16:53.045
OR A SNOWFLAKE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, MANY MINDS HAVE
BEEN CHANGED BY BEING LISTENED
TO, BY CONVERSATION, BEING TOLD

16:53.112 --> 16:57.316
THAT THEY'RE LOVED.
>> O'Donnell: SOMETHING THAT WE
WOULD ALL CONSIDER MAYBE SO
SIMPLE IS SO POWERFUL.

16:57.383 --> 17:05.257
>> Isay: YEAH, BEING TOLD THAT,
ALL OF OUR STORIES MATTER
EQUALLY AND INFINITELY, IS-- YOU
KNOW, IS-- IS SOMETHING EVERYONE

17:05.324 --> 17:10.496
NEEDS TO HEAR.
>> O'Donnell: DAVE ISAY SEEMS TO
ALWAYS BE LISTENING, ALWAYS
TAKING NOTES, EVEN DURING OUR

17:10.562 --> 17:18.170
INTERVIEW.
HE TOLD US JOURNALISM SHOULD BE
A PUBLIC SERVICE, AND NOW HOPES
THAT "ONE SMALL STEP" CAN HELP

17:18.237 --> 17:25.244
END WHAT HE CALLS THE "CULTURE
OF CONTEMPT" THAT IS TEARING
APART THE COUNTRY.
>> Isay: THE SITUATION IS SO BAD

17:25.310 --> 17:32.985
THAT, YOU KNOW, IF-- IF THE
CULTURE OF CONTEMPT WINS--
THINGS ARE JUST NOT GOING TO END
WELL FOR THE UNITED STATES.

17:33.051 --> 17:38.524
>> O'Donnell: WHAT'S FUELING THE
CULTURE OF CONTEMPT?
>> Isay: IT'S MEDIA.
IT'S SOCIAL MEDIA.

17:38.590 --> 17:46.498
I MEAN, THERE'S A MULTI-MULTI-
MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR HATE
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, WHERE
PEOPLE-- YOU KNOW, CAN MAKE

17:46.565 --> 17:53.839
MONEY BY MAKING US HATE AND FEAR
EACH OTHER.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DAVID AND
GOLIATH FIGHT HERE.

17:53.906 --> 18:00.746
>> O'Donnell: LONG BEFORE HE
STARTED STORYCORPS AND "ONE
SMALL STEP," DAVE ISAY FOUGHT TO
TELL STORIES OF THE FORGOTTEN BY

18:00.813 --> 18:06.585
MAKING RADIO DOCUMENTARIES IN
FLOPHOUSES, COAL MINES, AND
PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS.
>> Isay: I NEED YOU GUYS FROM

18:06.652 --> 18:10.589
HERE ON IN TO BE, LIKE, REALLY
ON TOP OF STUFF.
>> O'Donnell: HE FIRST APPEARED
ON "60 MINUTES" NEARLY 25 YEARS

18:10.656 --> 18:20.933
AGO, IN A STORY WITH LESLEY
STAHL ABOUT TWO TEENAGERS FROM
CHICAGO WHO MADE THEIR OWN
DOCUMENTARY WITH HIS HELP.

18:20.999 --> 18:26.872
THE PAIR WON A PEABODY AWARD,
ONE OF THE HIGHEST HONORS IN
BROADCASTING.
>> Teenager: THANK YOU.

18:26.939 --> 18:33.445
>> O'Donnell: IN 2003, HE GOT
THE IDEA FOR STORYCORPS.
>> Isay: EVERYBODY-- MY FAMILY,
EVERYBODY, THOUGHT IT WAS

18:33.512 --> 18:38.584
ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
YOU KNOW, WE-- (<i> LAUGHTER</i> )
WE STARTED WITH A BOOTH IN GRAND
CENTRAL TERMINAL.

18:38.650 --> 18:42.588
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE IDEA.
YOU COME TO THE BOOTH WITH YOUR
GRANDMOTHER, WITH ANYONE WHO YOU
WANT TO HONOR BY LISTENING TO

18:42.654 --> 18:46.658
THEM.
SO PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS, "IF I
HAD 40 MINUTES LEFT TO LIVE,
WHAT WOULD I SAY TO THIS PERSON

18:46.725 --> 18:53.632
WHO MEANS SO MUCH TO ME?"
>> O'Donnell: TO ATTRACT PEOPLE,
HE REACHED OUT TO THE PEOPLE'S
LIBRARY-- SPECIFICALLY THE

18:53.699 --> 18:58.303
DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS' AMERICAN FOLKLIFE
CENTER.
>> Isay: AND I SAID, "I'M GOING

18:58.370 --> 19:03.509
TO TRY AND RECORD THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.
WILL YOU ACCEPT THE MATERIAL?"
AND SHE SAID THOSE MAGICAL THREE

19:03.575 --> 19:09.047
LETTERS, "YES."
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AND THAT WAS IT.
AND HERE WE ARE.

19:09.114 --> 19:14.653
>> O'Donnell: THE STORYCORPS
ARCHIVE IS IN GOOD COMPANY AT
WHAT IS THE LARGEST LIBRARY IN
THE WORLD.

19:14.720 --> 19:22.694
OTHER TREASURES HERE INCLUDE A
RARE GUTENBERG BIBLE, AS WELL AS
A DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE HANDWRITTEN BY

19:22.761 --> 19:30.636
THOMAS JEFFERSON, AND A
PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF PRESIDENT
LINCOLN'S EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION.

19:30.702 --> 19:38.644
DR. CARLA HAYDEN SERVES AS THE
LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS.
UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS A LIFETIME
APPOINTMENT, SO ONLY 14 PEOPLE

19:38.710 --> 19:46.818
HAVE HELD THE JOB SINCE 1802.
HOW DOES HAVING STORYCORPS HERE
FIT INTO YOUR VISION FOR THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS?

19:46.885 --> 19:54.993
>> Dr. Carla Hayden: STORYCORPS
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ADDING
HISTORY AND CONTEXT AND THE
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE HISTORY.

19:55.060 --> 20:02.334
NOT JUST THE ONES THAT WE SEE ON
THE NEWS, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR
AMERICAN LIFE.

20:02.401 --> 20:10.642
THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE-- WHAT DID
THEY FEEL, WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE?
>> O'Donnell: TO TRY TO FIND
OUT, STORYCORPS ROLLED OUT A

20:10.709 --> 20:18.650
MOBILE BOOTH IN 2005 TO TRAVEL
THE COUNTRY.
THEY ALSO LAUNCHED PARTNERSHIPS
AND STORY COLLECTION PROGRAMS IN

20:18.717 --> 20:22.688
MULTIPLE AMERICAN CITIES.
>> Isay: THIS IS DAVE ISAY,
FOUNDER OF STORYCORPS.
>> O'Donnell: WHEN THE PANDEMIC

20:22.754 --> 20:30.495
HIT, THEY CREATED A NEW WAY FOR
PEOPLE TO SUBMIT STORIES ONLINE.
>> Isay: SHARE YOUR INTERVIEW
FAR AND WIDE, AND KNOW THAT

20:30.562 --> 20:38.637
SOMEDAY, FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL
BE LISTENING.
>> O'Donnell: EVERY FRIDAY, FOR
THE LAST 16 YEARS, NATIONAL

20:38.704 --> 20:47.479
PUBLIC RADIO SENDS ONE STORY
INTO THE HOMES, HEADPHONES, AND
CARS OF SIX MILLION PEOPLE.
>> Steve Inskeep: HEY, IT'S

20:47.546 --> 20:53.585
FRIDAY, WHICH IS WHEN WE HEAR
FROM STORYCORPS.
>> O'Donnell: WE WERE RECENTLY
AT NPR'S WASHINGTON STUDIO TO

20:53.652 --> 21:00.692
HEAR "MORNING EDITION" HOST
STEVE INSKEEP INTRODUCE THE
STORY OF MIGUEL ENCINIAS, A
DECORATED FIGHTER PILOT WHO

21:00.759 --> 21:06.698
PASSED AWAY IN 2016 AT THE AGE
OF 92.
>> Inskeep: HE SERVED AS A U.S.
MILITARY PILOT IN WORLD WAR II

21:06.765 --> 21:15.974
AND KOREA AND VIETNAM.
TWO OF HIS CHILDREN, ISABEL AND
JUAN PABLO ENCINIAS, CAME TO
STORYCORPS TO REMEMBER HIM.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.845
>> Isabel Encinias: WHEN I WAS
LITTLE, I REMEMBER HIM FLYING IN
HIS FIGHTER JET AND US WAITING
FOR HIM ON THE TARMAC AND

21:19.911 --> 21:26.084
THINKING, "OH MY GOD, WHAT A
HERO MY FATHER IS."
>> Juan-Pablo Encinias: AS HE
GOT OLDER, HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

21:26.151 --> 21:33.625
DEMENTIA.
BUT EVEN AT THE END, WHEN HE
COGNITIVELY WASN'T ALL THERE, HE
WOULD HEAR A PLANE AND JUST LOOK

21:33.692 --> 21:40.432
UP AND STARE AT IT IN THE SKY.
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT HE JUST
WANTED TO BE UP IN THAT PLANE
WITH EVERY OUNCE OF HIS BEING.

21:40.499 --> 21:44.670
>> Isabel Encinias: MAYBE HE'S
LISTENING TO US SOMEWHERE UP
THERE.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

21:44.736 --> 21:47.806
>> Juan-Pablo Encinias: I HOPE
SO.
>> Isay: SOMETIMES, IN AN
INTERVIEW, YOU CAN ALMOST SEE

21:47.873 --> 21:51.610
SPARKS FLYING OUT OF SOMEONE'S
MOUTH.
THERE'S-- THERE'S JUST THIS KIND
OF MAGNIFICENCE AND GRACE TO THE

21:51.677 --> 21:57.616
STORY.
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE YOU
JUST-- IT-- IT ALMOST DEMANDS TO
BE SHARED WITH A LARGER

21:57.683 --> 22:03.689
AUDIENCE.
>> O'Donnell: IN 2010,
STORYCORPS BEGAN TO ANIMATE
CONVERSATIONS TO BE VIEWED BY

22:03.755 --> 22:13.932
NEW AUDIENCES ONLINE, LIKE THIS
ONE, RECORDED IN MISSISSIPPI,
BETWEEN ALBERT SYKES AND HIS
NINE-YEAR-OLD SON AIDAN.

22:13.999 --> 22:18.036
>> Aidan Sykes: ARE YOU PROUD OF
ME?
>> Albert Sykes: OF COURSE.
YOU MY MAN.

22:18.103 --> 22:25.444
I-- I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT
YOU, PERIOD.
>> Aidan Sykes: THE THING I LOVE
ABOUT YOU-- YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON

22:25.510 --> 22:30.549
ME.
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WIL
ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT MY DAD.
>> O'Donnell: HAVE YOU THOUGHT

22:30.615 --> 22:34.219
ABOUT SELLING KLEENEXES?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
YOU COULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
>> Isay: WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO

22:34.286 --> 22:38.790
GET KLEENEX AS A SPONSOR, BUT
THEY'VE NEVER AGREED.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> O'Donnell: ONLY A TINY

22:38.857 --> 22:46.298
FRACTION OF STORYCORPS' HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF STORIES EVER
MAKE IT ONTO THE RADIO.
THEY'RE SELECTED BY STORYCORPS'

22:46.364 --> 22:53.705
FACILITATORS, WHO MAKE UP THE
ACTUAL CORPS OF STORYCORPS.
>> Facilitator: ONCE I PRESS
RECORD, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU

22:53.772 --> 22:57.676
INTRODUCE YOURSELVES.
>> O'Donnell: FACILITATORS ARE
TRAINED IN BOTH THE ART AND THE
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF STORY

22:57.743 --> 23:03.749
COLLECTION.
>> Facilitator: WONDERFUL.
>> O'Donnell: JASON REYNOLDS
SERVES ON STORYCORPS' BOARD OF

23:03.815 --> 23:13.158
DIRECTORS.
HE'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR AND CELEBRATED YOUNG
ADULT AUTHORS IN THE COUNTRY.

23:13.225 --> 23:18.864
16 YEARS AGO, FRESH OUT OF
COLLEGE, HE WAS A FACILITATOR
WHO CONDUCTED CLOSE TO 300
STORYCORPS SESSIONS OVER 18

23:18.930 --> 23:25.137
MONTHS.
>> Jason Reynolds: I FELT LIKE I
WAS PRIVY TO SOMETHING SPECIAL,
SOMETHING SACRED, YOU KNOW, AND

23:25.203 --> 23:29.508
SOMETHING THAT WOULD LAST
FOREVER.
YOU KNOW, AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW
THAT I'M IN THE ROOM, RIGHT?

23:29.574 --> 23:33.545
BUT I WAS IN THE ROOM FOR SOME
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TALES I'VE
EVER HEARD.
>> O'Donnell: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

23:33.612 --> 23:42.087
WHAT YOU HEARD IN THE BOOTH IS
VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT PEOPLE
MAY HEAR ON THE RADIO?
>> Reynolds: ABSOLUTELY.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.891
SOMETIMES YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR
THE ANXIETY OF IT ALL.
AND OTHER TIMES, YOU CAN HEAR--
THE GENTLE TENDERNESS OF HUMAN

23:45.957 --> 23:54.432
BEINGS.
>> Isay: I THINK STORYCORPS AND
THE FACILITATORS, THEY GET TO
SEE, YOU KNOW, WHO WE REALLY ARE

23:54.499 --> 24:03.141
AS AMERICANS, AND IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SEE ON 24-HOUR NEWS.
>> O'Donnell: AROUND THE TIME OF
THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,

24:03.208 --> 24:09.815
DAVE ISAY SAYS HE GOT THE IDEA
FOR A NEW KIND OF STORYCORPS
THAT COULD PERHAPS HELP UNITE A
COUNTRY BECOMING INCREASINGLY

24:09.881 --> 24:15.387
DIVIDED.
HE DECIDED TO CALL IT "ONE SMALL
STEP."
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

24:15.453 --> 24:21.393
REGULAR STORYCORPS AND ONE SMALL
STEP?
>> Isay: SO, EVERY REGULAR
STORYCORPS INTERVIEW ARE PEOPLE

24:21.459 --> 24:26.565
WHO KNOW AND LOVE EACH OTHER.
AND EVERY ONE SMALL STEP
INTERVIEW ARE STRANGERS.
AND IN THE CASE OF ONE SMALL

24:26.631 --> 24:31.069
STEP, IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE ACROSS
THE POLITICAL DIVIDE.
>> Facilitator: SO, AFTER YOU
READ EACH OTHER'S BIOS, I'M

24:31.136 --> 24:38.543
GOING TO ASK, WHY DID YOU WANT
TO DO THE INTERVIEW TODAY?
>> Isay: SO, WE MATCH STRANGERS
WHO DISAGREE POLITICALLY, TO PUT

24:38.610 --> 24:43.215
THEM FACE-TO-FACE FOR 50
MINUTES.
IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS;
IT'S JUST TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

24:43.281 --> 24:50.922
LIVES.
>> O'Donnell: FACILITATORS BEGIN
BY ASKING THE PARTICIPANTS TO
READ ONE ANOTHER'S BIOGRAPHY OUT

24:50.989 --> 24:57.195
LOUD, AS IN THIS RECENT SESSION
IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.
THE PROJECT TRIES TO MATCH
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE FROM DIFFERENT

24:57.262 --> 25:03.902
POLITICAL PARTIES, BUT HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON.
>> Brenda Brown-Grooms: "HI.
I GREW UP AS AN ARMY BRAT AND--

25:03.969 --> 25:12.043
AND EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN,
SURROUNDED BY A VERY POWERFUL
IDEOLOGY OF CONSERVATISM,
PATRIOTISM, AND RELIGION."

25:12.110 --> 25:18.683
>> Nicole Unice: "I AM A BAPTIST
PASTOR AND PERFORMANCE ARTIST, A
NATIVE CHARLOTTESVILLIAN,
GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

25:18.750 --> 25:23.021
VIRGINIA, AND UNION THEOLOGICAL
SEMINARY IN NEW YORK CITY."
>> O'Donnell: PARTICIPANTS ARE
ENCOURAGED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY

25:23.088 --> 25:28.727
SHARE.
>> Brown-Grooms: WE'RE PASTORS,
AND WE'RE-- WE-- WE'RE HELPING
PEOPLE TO FIND THEIR PATH AND

25:28.793 --> 25:37.602
FIND THEIR VOICE.
>> Unice: OH, BRENDA, I LOVE
WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT HELPING
PEOPLE FIND THEIR PATH, BECAUSE

25:37.669 --> 25:42.974
I FEEL SUCH A CONNECTION THERE.
>> O'Donnell: THE FORMAT IS
DERIVED FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL
CONCEPT DEVELOPED IN THE 1950s

25:43.041 --> 25:50.982
CALLED CONTACT THEORY.
>> Isay: WHICH SAYS THAT WHEN
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE
ENEMIES, AND YOU PUT THEM FACE-

25:51.049 --> 25:58.990
TO-FACE UNDER VERY, VERY
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS-- AND THEY
HAVE A CONVERSATION AND A KIND
OF VISCERAL, EMOTIONAL

25:59.057 --> 26:05.897
EXPERIENCE WITH EACH OTHER, THAT
HATE CAN MELT AWAY.
AND PEOPLE CAN SEE EACH OTHER IN
A NEW WAY.

26:05.964 --> 26:10.268
>> Unice: I'M HERE BECAUSE I
THOUGHT, "I WANT TO BE A PART OF
A BETTER WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN."

26:10.335 --> 26:17.976
>> Brown-Grooms: YEAH.
YEAH.
I CAN'T SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD,
BUT I CAN DO MY PART WHERE I AM.

26:18.043 --> 26:24.816
AND, DAGNABBIT, I'M GOING TO.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> O'Donnell: ONE SMALL STEP
JUST CROSSED THE NOT-SO-SMALL

26:24.883 --> 26:29.988
MILESTONE OF COMPLETING 1,000
SESSIONS, AND THERE ARE OVER
6,000 PEOPLE ON THE WAITING
LIST.

26:30.055 --> 26:35.060
>> Isay: SO, I'M JUST GOING TO
GIVE YOU A QUICK RUNDOWN ON
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH ONE
SMALL STEP SINCE WE LAST SPOKE.

26:35.126 --> 26:43.034
>> O'Donnell: ONCE A MONTH, DAVE
ISAY MEETS WITH WHAT HE CALLS
ONE SMALL STEP'S BRAIN-TRUST.
IT INCLUDES SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

26:43.101 --> 26:47.939
PROFESSORS FROM YALE AND
COLUMBIA, FORMER POLITICAL
ADVISERS FROM BOTH THE RIGHT AND
THE LEFT...

26:48.006 --> 26:51.977
>> Member: I LIKE HOW YOU CAN'T
TELL WHO'S A DEMOCRAT AND WHO'S
A REPUBLICAN.
>> O'Donnell: ...AND POLLSTERS

26:52.043 --> 26:59.050
WHO'VE FOUND DATA TO SUPPORT THE
IDEA THAT THERE IS AN "EXHAUSTED
MAJORITY" IN AMERICA.
>> Isay: THEY'RE TIRED, THEY'RE

26:59.117 --> 27:02.487
SCARED, THEY'RE SICK OF THE
DIVISION, AND THEY WANT TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY OUT.
AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT--

27:02.554 --> 27:10.028
WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM A WAY
OUT.
>> O'Donnell: DAVE ISAY MAKES IT
A POINT TO VENTURE OUTSIDE OF

27:10.095 --> 27:15.100
STORYCORPS' HOME TURF ON NPR TO
INCREASE THE PROJECT'S REACH.
>> Tucker Carlson: I HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT YOUR POLITICS ARE,

27:15.166 --> 27:18.203
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS I
LIKE YOU SO MUCH, BECAUSE I
DON'T THINK YOU ARE PRIMARILY
POLITICAL.

27:18.269 --> 27:22.607
YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
>> O'Donnell: YOU ACTIVELY SEEK
OUT MEDIA OUTLETS THAT APPEAL TO

27:22.674 --> 27:26.711
CONSERVATIVES?
>> Isay: YES.
>> O'Donnell: LIKE TUCKER
CARLSON, GLENN BECK.

27:26.778 --> 27:38.523
>> Isay: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT MAKES ONE
SMALL STEP SPECIAL IS THAT ALL
OF US BELIEVE IN EVERY CELL OF

27:38.590 --> 27:45.363
OUR BODY THAT THERE IS A FLAME
OF GOOD IN YOU, WHETHER YOU'RE
LIBERAL OR WHETHER YOU'RE
CONSERVATIVE.

27:45.430 --> 27:50.335
AND OUR JOB IS TO FAN THAT FLAME
UNTIL IT BECOMES A ROARING FIRE.
>> Reynolds: I TAKE MY HAT OFF
TO DAVE.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.405
I THINK-- I THINK, ONCE MORE,
HE'S PROVING THAT, LIKE, HE--
HE-- HE'S WILLING TO WALK THE
WALK.

27:53.471 --> 27:58.143
>> O'Donnell: WHEN YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE ONE SMALL STEP
INITIATIVE, WHAT DID YOU THINK?
>> Reynolds: IT IS VERY, VERY

27:58.209 --> 28:06.351
DIFFICULT FOR US TO HATE ONE
ANOTHER WHEN I'M LOOKING YOU IN
THE FACE, AND WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT WE LIKE TO S-- COOK

28:06.418 --> 28:13.291
OUR CHILDREN FOR DINNER.
AND TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT
IT IS TO GET OUR BABIES INTO
COLLEGE.

28:13.358 --> 28:18.663
IT ISN'T AN EASY FIX, IT ISN'T
SOME KIND OF HOCUS POCUS, OR YOU
KNOW, KUMBAYA, OR IT'S ALL FINE.
IT ISN'T ANY OF THAT.

28:18.730 --> 28:22.467
HE KNOWS THAT.
BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO
SOMETHING.
>> Isay: OUR DREAM WITH ONE

28:22.534 --> 28:28.106
SMALL STEP IS THAT WE CONVINCE
THE COUNTRY THAT IT'S OUR
PATRIOTIC DUTY TO SEE THE
HUMANITY IN PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE

28:28.173 --> 28:32.377
DISAGREE.
>> O'Donnell: IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A LOT OF STORIES TO BRING THIS
COUNTRY TOGETHER.

28:32.444 --> 28:39.717
>> Isay: WE'RE BANKING ON A BIT
OF A MIRACLE HERE.
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE UP.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:39.784 --> 28:45.990
>><i> THE STORYCORPS SESSION JASON</i>
<i>REYNOLDS NEVER FORGOT:</i>
>> Reynolds: WHAT A GIFT TO BE
ALLOWED TO WATCH SUCH AN

28:46.057 --> 28:58.903
INCREDIBLE THING HAPPEN.

(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:58.970 --> 29:05.743
>> Jon Wertheim: THE N.F.L.
PLAYOFFS START NEXT WEEKEND, AND
HERE'S ONE SAFE BET: AT LEAST A
FEW GAMES WILL COME DOWN TO

29:05.810 --> 29:14.486
FOOTBALL'S GREAT SECRET, HIDING
IN PLAIN SIGHT.
WE SPEAK OF KICKERS, WHO SCORE
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POINTS IN

29:14.552 --> 29:20.058
THE N.F.L., BUT ONLY GET A SMALL
FRACTION OF THE RESPECT.
IT WAS BUDDY RYAN, THE HARD-
BOILED COACH, WHO ONCE GROWLED:

29:20.125 --> 29:24.929
"KICKERS ARE LIKE TAXI-CABS.
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO OUT AND HIRE
ANOTHER ONE."
SURE ENOUGH, THIS SEASON, ALMOST

29:24.996 --> 29:30.969
HALF THE N.F.L. TEAMS HAVE
REPLACED THEIR KICKERS, AT LEAST
ONCE.
BUT THEN, ONTO THE FIELD JOGS

29:31.035 --> 29:36.975
JUSTIN TUCKER OF THE BALTIMORE
RAVENS, WHO CLEAVES THE UPRIGHTS
WITH A MIX OF POWER AND
PRECISION.

29:37.041 --> 29:43.281
THE RAVENS HAD A ROUGH SEASON,
BUT TUCKER IS ON A TRAJECTORY,
END-OVER-END, TO GO DOWN AS
PERHAPS THE GREATEST N.F.L.

29:43.348 --> 29:48.720
KICKER, THERE EVER WAS-- IN
TURN, ELEVATING THE ENTIRE
POSITION.
>> Announcer:<i> THIS IS THE GUY</i>

29:48.786 --> 29:54.959
<i>YOU WANT, GREG!</i>
>> Wertheim: IF THERE WERE ONE
SIGNATURE MOMENT FROM THE N.F.L.
THIS SEASON, IT MIGHT BE THIS.

29:55.026 --> 30:01.833
(<i> CROWD NOISE</i> )
DETROIT LIONS, 17; BALTIMORE
RAVENS, 16.
THREE SECONDS LEFT.

30:01.900 --> 30:09.274
JUSTIN TUCKER, THE RAVENS' 32-
YEAR-OLD KICKER, LINES UP BEYOND
MIDFIELD, BEYOND THE TAIL OF THE
LIONS' LOGO...

30:09.340 --> 30:15.313
>> Announcer: THIS IS FOR AN
N.F.L. RECORD, 66 YARDS.
>> Wertheim: ...AND, ACTION.
>> Announcer: ON ITS WAY!

30:15.380 --> 30:18.950
>> Justin Tucker: I FELT THE
THUD OF THE BALL, I KNEW IT WAS
GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE.
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL

30:19.017 --> 30:27.225
I SAW THE BALL HIT THE CROSSBAR.
>> Announcer: IT BOUNCES OFF THE
CROSSBAR, AND IT'S GOOD!
HA-HA-HA-- OH MY GOODNESS!

30:27.292 --> 30:30.762
OH MY GOODNESS!
>> Tucker: I THINK THAT'S WHEN
WE ALL KNEW THAT WE HAD JUST
BEEN A PART OF AN HISTORIC

30:30.828 --> 30:38.970
MOMENT.
>> Wertheim: NOTE THE REACTION
OF HIS COACH, JOHN HARBAUGH.
(<i> CHEERS AND APPLAUSE</i> )

30:39.037 --> 30:43.975
TUCKER'S TEAMMATES WERE EQUALLY
GIDDY.
>> Teammate: AHH!
LET'S GO!

30:44.042 --> 30:50.081
>> Wertheim: WHAT MADE IT
REMARKABLE?
FOR ONE, THE SHEER DISTANCE.
BY A MATTER OF INCHES, THE 66-

30:50.148 --> 30:55.453
YARDER SET A NEW N.F.L.
RECORD FOR LONGEST FIELD GOAL
EVER.
BUT ALSO, SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU

30:55.520 --> 31:01.859
HEARD THIS KIND OF SWOONING OVER
A KICKER?
>> Harbaugh: WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOREVER!

31:01.926 --> 31:03.962
SO PROUD OF YOU, MAN.
HE'S THE BEST EVER.
HE'S THE BEST.
>> Wertheim: BEST EVER?

31:04.028 --> 31:08.900
>> Harbaugh: BEST THAT'S EVER
DONE IT.
(<i> LOCKER ROOM</i> )
>> Wertheim: JOHN HARBAUGH SAYS

31:08.967 --> 31:11.135
IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF
TUCKER'S RECORD-BREAKER IN
DETROIT.
WHAT IS HIS SECRET KICKING

31:11.202 --> 31:15.974
SAUCE?
>> Harbaugh: YOU KNOW, HE'S A
VERY TALENTED GUY; LEG STRENGTH,
ACCURACY.

31:16.040 --> 31:22.013
ALL THE NUMBERS ARE THERE.
BUT TO ME, THE BIGGEST THING IS
JUST THE WAY HE APPROACHES IT.
I MEAN, HIS DEMEANOR, PERSONA,

31:22.080 --> 31:26.751
IN THE BIGGEST MOMENTS, THE
BIGGEST KICKS, UNDER THE MOST
PRESSURE, THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM
THE BEST EVER.

31:26.818 --> 31:31.022
>> Wertheim: YOU SOUND FIRED UP
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.
>> Harbaugh: WELL, I'M FIRED UP
THAT HE'S OUR KICKER.

31:31.089 --> 31:35.026
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
MAKES US A BETTER FOOTBALL TEAM.
>> Wertheim: TUCKER WEIGHS ONLY
180 POUNDS, BUT HE'S OFTEN

31:35.093 --> 31:42.300
RESCUED THE RAVENS.
>> Announcer: JUSTIN TUCKER!
>> Wertheim: GOING INTO THIS
WEEKEND, TUCKER HAD MADE 57

31:42.367 --> 31:48.606
STRAIGHT FIELD GOALS IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER OR OVERTIME.
HE WASN'T DRAFTED.
HE'S SCORED MORE THAN A<i> THIRD OF</i>

31:48.673 --> 31:52.076
THE RAVENS' POINTS SINCE HE'S
GOTTEN HERE.
>> Harbaugh: RIGHT.
>> Wertheim: IS HE WORTH A

31:52.143 --> 31:55.013
FIRST-ROUND PICK TODAY?
>> Harbaugh: HE IS.
ABSOLUTELY.
HE WOULD BE.

31:55.079 --> 32:00.051
>> Wertheim: HERE'S THE REAL
KICKER, AS IT WERE: ACROSS THE
N.F.L., MORE FIELD GOALS ARE
BEING MADE FROM LONGER

32:00.118 --> 32:08.726
DISTANCES, WITH GREATER ACCURACY
THAN EVER.
BUT THEN THERE ARE WACKY SUNDAYS
LIKE THE ONE IN OCTOBER...

32:08.793 --> 32:11.496
>> Announcer: IT'S NO GOOD!
McPHERSON'S KICK.
>> Wertheim: ...WHEN NORMALLY
RELIABLE KICKERS FOR THE PACKERS

32:11.562 --> 32:19.203
AND BENGALS...
>> Announcer: NO GOOD!
CROSBY FROM 40-- IT IS NO GOOD!
>> Wertheim: ...COMBINED TO MISS

32:19.270 --> 32:24.142
FIVE FIELD GOALS IN THE LAST TEN
MINUTES.
>> Announcer: WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> Wertheim: AND THE EXTRA

32:24.208 --> 32:33.685
POINT, ONCE ALMOST AUTOMATIC,
HAS BECOME MORE OF AN ADVENTURE
SINCE THE N.F.L. EXTENDED THE
DISTANCE IN 2015.

32:33.751 --> 32:38.890
>> Announcer: UGH!
>> Wertheim: ALL THOSE GAMES
HINGING ON THE SMALLEST GUYS ON
THE FIELD, SPLITTING OR MISSING

32:38.956 --> 32:46.064
THOSE TWO UPRIGHTS?
THE OUTCOME WILL DEPEND AS MUCH
ON THE MIND AS ON THE FOOT.
EVEN FOR JUSTIN TUCKER, NERVES

32:46.130 --> 32:48.466
COME INTO PLAY.
>> Tucker: IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING
JUST, LIKE, A LITTLE SOMETHING,
LIKE, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU EVEN

32:48.533 --> 32:55.807
REALLY LIVING?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S PART OF THE
CHALLENGE OF PLAYING THIS
POSITION AT THIS LEVEL, IS

32:55.873 --> 33:01.879
THINKING ABOUT ALL THAT,
PROCESSING IT,
COMPARTMENTALIZING IT, PUTTING
IT AWAY, AND THEN STILL GOING

33:01.946 --> 33:07.151
OUT THERE AND DOING YOUR JOB.
>> Announcer: CALAIS CAMPBELL!
>> Wertheim: TUCKER'S TEAMMATE,
SIX-FOOT EIGHT DEFENSIVE LINEMAN

33:07.218 --> 33:12.790
CALAIS CAMPBELL, WHOSE JOB
INCLUDES BLOCKING KICKS, SAYS HE
CAN DETECT FEAR IN KICKERS WHEN
THE GAME'S ON THE LINE.

33:12.857 --> 33:16.127
>> Calais Campbell: YOU KNOW, IT
CAN BE REALLY GOOD KICKERS,
UNTIL A SITUATION COMES AND THEY
JUST-- ALL THAT CONFIDENCE GOES

33:16.194 --> 33:21.799
AWAY.
YOU CAN SEE THE NERVOUSNESS IN
THEIR EYES.
AND VERY FEW KICKERS HAVE THE

33:21.866 --> 33:26.003
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THAT-- THAT KIND OF PRESSURE.
>> Wertheim: YOU SEE THAT, ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE?

33:26.070 --> 33:33.978
>> Campbell: OH, YEAH, ALL THE
TIME.
>> Wertheim: N.F.L. KICKING
TITAN MORTEN ANDERSEN MADE 583

33:34.045 --> 33:36.981
FIELD GOALS OVER A 25-YEAR
CAREER.
ANDERSEN SAYS KICKERS HAVE
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

33:37.048 --> 33:42.487
>> Morten Andersen: WE'RE VERY
EXPOSED.
OUR PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK IS
IMMEDIATE.

33:42.553 --> 33:45.857
IT'S EITHER GOOD OR BAD.
>> Wertheim: HOW MUCH OF THIS IS
MENTAL?
>> Andersen: I WOULD SAY 90% OF

33:45.923 --> 33:49.260
IT IS MENTAL, AND THE LAST 10%
IS MENTAL.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Wertheim: IT'S LIKE YOGI

33:49.327 --> 33:52.930
BERRA DOES KICKING.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
YOU HAD A KICK TO GO TO THE
SUPER BOWL.

33:52.997 --> 33:55.166
>> Andersen: YEAH.
>> Wertheim: DID YOU FEEL FEAR
WHEN YOU WALKED OUT?
>> Andersen: NO.

33:55.233 --> 34:01.105
BECAUSE I HAD, IN MY MENTAL
REHEARSALS, THE NIGHT BEFORE, IN
THE HOTEL, I-- I WOULD DO THREE
OR FOUR SCENARIOS.

34:01.172 --> 34:07.211
I WOULD REHEARSE THEM IN SLOW
MOTION AND REAL TIME.
SO, I REMEMBER STANDING ON THE
SIDELINE, AND ALL MY TEAMMATES

34:07.278 --> 34:12.116
WERE ON THEIR KNEES.
THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS.
AND I THOUGHT TO MY-- I REMEMBER
THINKING TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW,

34:12.183 --> 34:17.422
"THEY'RE NOT DRIVING THE CAR.
I'M DRIVING THE CAR."
>> Wertheim: WHEN ANDERSEN DROVE
THE ATLANTA FALCONS INTO THE

34:17.488 --> 34:27.231
SUPER BOWL IN 1999, HE WAS SO
SURE HE'D NAILED HIS KICK, HE
DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO WATCH.
ANDERSEN IS THE SECOND-LEADING

34:27.298 --> 34:34.172
SCORER IN N.F.L. HISTORY--
BEHIND ANOTHER KICKER, FOUR-TIME
SUPER BOWL WINNER ADAM
VINATIERI-- AND YET...

34:34.238 --> 34:37.742
YOU'RE ONE OF ONLY TWO PURE
KICKERS IN THE FOOTBALL HALL OF
FAME.
HOW CAN THAT BE?

34:37.809 --> 34:42.713
>> Andersen: IT'S A GREAT
INJUSTICE!
ONE OF THE GREATEST INJUSTICES
IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

34:42.780 --> 34:46.184
I'M KIDDING!
A LITTLE BIT.
>> Wertheim: YOU GUYS ARE
SCORING A THIRD OF THE POINTS,

34:46.250 --> 34:48.753
THOUGH.
HOW CAN THERE BE ONLY TWO OF
YOU?
>> Andersen: CORRECT, AND-- AND

34:48.820 --> 34:52.190
IF, IF THE POINT OF THE GAME IS
TO SCORE MORE POINTS THAN THE
OTHER TEAM, WHO'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE LEADING SCORER ON THE

34:52.256 --> 34:57.795
FOOTBALL TEAM?
>> Wertheim: KICKERS HAVE LONG
BEEN SEEN AS SOMETHING, WELL,
FOREIGN.

34:57.862 --> 35:03.367
LITERALLY.
GUYS BORN IN EUROPE WITH NAMES
LIKE GOGOLAK AND STENERUD.
MAYBE IT WAS THE BAREFOOT

35:03.434 --> 35:11.342
KICKERS IN THE SNOW, OR GARO
YEPREMIAN'S LONE PASS OF HIS
CAREER-- IN THE SUPER BOWL NO
LESS-- THAT HELPED CREATE A

35:11.409 --> 35:17.648
PERCEPTION: KICKERS AREN'T REAL
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
AND THEN, THERE IS ANOTHER FALSE
PERCEPTION: THAT KICKING A

35:17.715 --> 35:22.353
FOOTBALL AIN'T ALL THAT
DIFFICULT.
YOU EVER HAVE TEAMMATES SAY,
"KICKING A BALL THROUGH

35:22.420 --> 35:27.458
UPRIGHTS, HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?"
>> Andersen: SO, EVERY SATURDAY
MORNING, WE HAD A WALK THROUGH.
AND ALL THE GUYS WANTED TO KICK

35:27.525 --> 35:32.663
FIELD GOALS.
AND I'M LIKE, "DON'T DO IT,
GUYS, THIS IS NOT MUSCLES YOU'RE
USED TO USING."

35:32.730 --> 35:35.633
>> Wertheim: ANYONE ACTUALLY
MAKE THE FIELD GOAL, WHEN THEY
WEREN'T BLOWING OUT THEIR KNEES?
>> Andersen: IT WASN'T A PRETTY

35:35.700 --> 35:39.270
SIGHT.
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "YOU GUYS
ARE IDIOTS!
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

35:39.337 --> 35:45.943
THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL."
>> Wertheim: THERE ARE SELDOM
BACK-UP KICKERS IN THE N.F.L.,
SO, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THREE

35:46.010 --> 35:51.482
WEEKS AGO WHEN CAROLINA PANTHERS
KICKER ZANE GONZALEZ INJURED HIS
LEG IN WARM-UPS.
THE TEAM SCRAMBLED TO FIND ANY

35:51.549 --> 35:57.622
PLAYER WHO COULD KICK, HOLDING
FIELD AUDITIONS ON THE SPOT.
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE PANTHERS
DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO KICK A FIELD

35:57.688 --> 36:05.696
GOAL OR EXTRA POINT THAT DAY.
THEN AGAIN, KICKERS ARE A
SPECIAL BREED.
>> Tucker: ♪ AVE MARIA ♪

36:05.763 --> 36:10.434
>> Wertheim: HOW MANY
LINEBACKERS DARE SING OPERA AS A
HOBBY?
JUSTIN TUCKER WAS HAPPY TO BELT

36:10.501 --> 36:22.313
OUT "AVE MARIA" AT A BALTIMORE
CHRISTMAS CONCERT A FEW YEARS
AGO.
>> Tucker: ♪ AVE MARIA ♪

36:22.380 --> 36:26.651
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Wertheim: WE HEARD HE'S SHY
ABOUT HIS SINGING.
>> Campbell: (<i> LAUGHS</i> )

36:26.717 --> 36:30.221
YEAH.
YEAH, VERY SHY.
I MEAN, HE'S THE LIFE OF THE
PARTY IN THE LOCKER ROOM EVERY

36:30.288 --> 36:32.456
DAY.
>> Wertheim: EVERY DAY, YOU
SAID?
>> Campbell: OH, EVERY DAY.

36:32.523 --> 36:40.331
>> Wertheim: KICKERS AVOID
FOOTBALL'S VIOLENCE.
THEY EVEN PRACTICE ON THEIR OWN
FIELD-- SOMETIMES, NOT AT ALL.

36:40.398 --> 36:46.070
WE HAD AN N.F.L. KICKER TELL US,
"ALL THE PLAYERS WANT TO BE US
DURING PRACTICE, AND NONE OF THE
TEAMMATES WANT TO BE US WITH

36:46.137 --> 36:51.342
THREE SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME."
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE SMILING WHEN I--
>> Tucker: IT'S BECAUSE I'VE
HEARD THAT, TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

36:51.409 --> 36:55.346
FROM-- FROM MY TEAMMATES, OVER
THE YEARS.
>> Wertheim: YOU BUY IT?
>> Tucker: AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY

36:55.413 --> 36:59.283
TRUE.
I MEAN, WE HAVE AN OBVIOUSLY
LIGHTER WORKLOAD.
WE'RE NOT HITTING OR GETTING

36:59.350 --> 37:06.791
HIT.
OUR PRACTICES ARE MUCH LESS
STRENUOUS THAN BASICALLY EVERY
SINGLE OTHER PERSON OUT HERE,

37:06.857 --> 37:13.698
YOU KNOW, WEARING A FOOTBALL
UNIFORM.
>> Wertheim: CONNOR BARTH KICKED
FOR FOUR N.F.L. TEAMS OVER A

37:13.764 --> 37:17.735
TEN-YEAR CAREER.
>> Connor Barth: I THINK PEOPLE
WANT TO BE US DURING PRACTICE,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE SNEAK OFF

37:17.802 --> 37:22.073
FROM CAMP AND PLAY SOME GOLF
AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HIT
STARBUCKS.
I ALWAYS SAY, IF YOU MAKE YOUR

37:22.139 --> 37:24.875
KICKS, NO ONE EVER IS GOING TO
WORRY ABOUT YOU.
>> Wertheim: I THINK I MISHEARD
YOU.

37:24.942 --> 37:28.379
YOU-- YOU DIDN'T REALLY SAY THAT
KICKERS<i> SNEAK OFF</i> DURING
PRACTICE, TO GO PLAY GOLF AND GO
TO STARBUCKS?

37:28.446 --> 37:34.151
>> Barth: I MEAN, YOU COULD ONLY
WATCH SO MUCH FILM KICKING,
RIGHT?
YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAYBOOK WITH

37:34.218 --> 37:38.322
500 PAGES IN IT.
SO, YOU GOT SOME DOWNTIME DURING
THE DAY.
>> Wertheim: BUT IT'S NOT ALL

37:38.389 --> 37:45.262
PAR THREES AND PUMPKIN SPICE
LATTE.
THERE IS A REAL PRECISION TO
KICKING A FIELD GOAL-- AN

37:45.329 --> 37:49.600
EFFICIENT THREE-MAN ASSEMBLY
LINE WITH THE SNAPPER AND
HOLDER.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FROM THE

37:49.667 --> 37:52.837
SNAP UNTIL YOU'RE BOOTING THAT
BALL?
>> Tucker: TYPICALLY, 1.3
SECONDS, GIVE OR TAKE SEVERAL

37:52.903 --> 37:58.876
HUNDREDTHS.
>> Wertheim: 1.3 SECONDS?
THAT'S IT?
>> Tucker: 1.3 SECONDS.

37:58.943 --> 38:03.481
>> Wertheim: IF IT'S 1.4, WHAT
HAPPENS?
>> Tucker: IF IT'S 1.4, YOU RUN
THE RISK OF GETTING A KICK

38:03.547 --> 38:10.388
BLOCKED BY AN EDGE RUSH.
>> Wertheim: SO, JUST A LITTLE
BIT OF TIME, AND SOMEONE ELSE IS
PUTTING THEIR HAND UP AND

38:10.454 --> 38:15.292
BLOCKING THAT KICK.
>> Tucker: EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW, THAT MUSCLE MEMORY
THAT GETS DEVELOPED THROUGHOUT,

38:15.359 --> 38:20.197
YOU KNOW, YEARS OF PRACTICE,
THAT'S WHAT GOES INTO THOSE 1.3
SECONDS, WHEN THEY MATTER THE
MOST.

38:20.264 --> 38:25.670
>> Wertheim: WE WERE ALSO
SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT TUCKER
AND HIS FELLOW KICKERS ARE
STRIKING A FOOTBALL UNIQUE TO

38:25.736 --> 38:30.307
THEM.
>> Barth: THAT'S DEFINITELY A K-
BALL RIGHT THERE.
>> Wertheim: A K-BALL.

38:30.374 --> 38:34.445
THE "K" STANDING FOR KICKERS.
>> Barth: YOU CAN'T DO TOO MANY
CRAZY THINGS, BUT YOU WANT TO
TRY TO LIKE, MASH THE BACK OF

38:34.512 --> 38:40.451
THIS BALL, AND BREAK IN THESE
SEAMS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
>> Tucker: I CAN'T GO TOO DEEPLY
INTO THE TRADE SECRETS THAT THE

38:40.518 --> 38:46.457
MEASURES OUR EQUIPMENT GUYS GO
TO, TO PREP THESE FOOTBALLS FOR
GAME DAY-- LEGALLY, I SHOULD
ADD.

38:46.524 --> 38:51.495
BUT THERE'S A BRUSH THAT HAS
BRISTLES ON ONE SIDE, AND THAT'S
THE ONLY TOOL THAT YOU'RE
ALLOWED TO USE.

38:51.562 --> 38:58.436
>> Barth: SO, YOU'RE BRUSHING...
>> Wertheim: THE BRUSH SMOOTHES
THE SIDES OF THE BALL WHERE THE
KICKER'S FOOT MAKES IMPACT.

38:58.502 --> 39:02.406
I DON'T THINK MOST FANS REALIZE
THAT THE BALL THAT THE
QUARTERBACK'S THROWING WITH, IS
DIFFERENT FROM THAN THE ONE

39:02.473 --> 39:07.478
YOU'RE KICKING WITH.
>> Barth: NO, I MEAN, A K-BALL,
QUARTERBACKS DO NOT USE IT.
THE REST OF THE POSITION PLAYERS

39:07.545 --> 39:10.915
DO NOT USE THIS BALL.
>> Tucker: THE PURPOSE OF THIS
BALL IS TO, YOU KNOW, SEND IT TO
THE MOON WITH MY FOOT.

39:10.981 --> 39:18.456
SO, ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO
LOOSEN UP THE LEATHER, SO WHEN
MY FOOT COMPRESSES INTO THE
BALL, IT EXPLODES THE OTHER WAY

39:18.522 --> 39:23.094
IN A WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS
BALL JUST SIMPLY WOULD NOT.
>> Wertheim: YOU TALK ABOUT A
SWEET SPOT?

39:23.160 --> 39:28.599
>> Tucker: I TRY TO PICK OUT THE
DIMPLES ON THE BALL THAT I'M
GOING TO MATCH UP MY FOOT TO.
>> Wertheim: REALLY?

39:28.666 --> 39:31.602
THE SPECIFIC DIMPLES?
>> Tucker: I-- I TRY TO.
>> Wertheim: WOW.
OH, GEEZ.

39:31.669 --> 39:38.709
>> Tucker: IT'S A LITTLE EASIER
SAID THAN DONE.
SO, MAYBE AN INCH UNDER THE
CENTER OF THE BALL.

39:38.776 --> 39:46.517
THAT'S WHERE I'M TRYING TO MATCH
THAT BONE COMING OFF OF MY BIG
TOE ON THE TOP OF MY FOOT.
I'M TRYING TO MATCH IT UP TO

39:46.584 --> 39:49.754
ABOUT RIGHT HERE.
>> Wertheim: WOW.
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FOOTWEAR,
HERE.

39:49.820 --> 39:55.559
CONNOR BARTH LET US IN ON MORE
TRIBAL SECRETS.
>> Barth: I TAKE, LIKE, A
MACHINE AND GRIND IT DOWN SO

39:55.626 --> 39:58.028
THAT MY FRONT CLEATS ARE
COMPLETELY FLAT.
THAT WAY, WHEN I SWING THROUGH
THE BALL, IT KIND OF GLIDES

39:58.095 --> 40:01.298
THROUGH LIKE-- ALMOST LIKE A
GOLF CLUB.
>> Wertheim: THIS PLANTS AND
THIS SLIDES.

40:01.365 --> 40:06.704
>> Barth: THIS ONE SLIDES
THROUGH.
THIS ONE IS YOUR PLANT SHOE--
THAT KIND OF JUST CATCHES

40:06.771 --> 40:09.974
EVERYTHING, SO THAT YOU STOP AND
YOU KICK.
>> Wertheim: IT'S LIKE TWO
DIFFERENT GARDEN TOOLS.

40:10.040 --> 40:14.712
>> Barth: YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY
COOL, IT'S--
>> Wertheim: BARTH'S SHOES ARE
NOT JUST MISMATCHED-- THEY'RE

40:14.779 --> 40:17.548
NOT EVEN THE SAME SIZE.
>> Barth: I WEAR A SIZE 12.
THIS IS A 10.5.
>> Wertheim: THAT'S A SIZE AND A

40:17.615 --> 40:22.219
HALF SMALLER THAN WHAT--
>> Barth: MY KICKING SHOE NEEDS
TO BE SO MUCH TIGHTER THAN MY
REGULAR.

40:22.286 --> 40:27.024
SO, IT'S PRETTY COOL, BUT I
THINK MY FOOT'S GOTTEN SMALLER
OVER THE YEARS, BECAUSE I'VE
BEEN JAMMING MY FOOT INTO A--

40:27.091 --> 40:32.096
ALMOST TWO TIMES SMALLER SHOE.
(<i> BALL IMPACT</i> )
>> Wertheim: WE MET BARTH ON HIS
OLD HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD

40:32.163 --> 40:43.307
IN WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.
HE WAS WARMING UP BY KICKING 40-
YARD FIELD GOALS WITH NO STEP.
TRY<i> THAT</i> SOMETIME.

40:43.374 --> 40:51.549
HE IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE
KICKER'S VULNERABILITY.
BARTH MADE 83% OF HIS N.F.L.
FIELD GOALS, BUT KICKING FOR THE
