04:04.094 --> 04:06.129
Long enough for someone to break
into the lab

04:06.180 --> 04:07.847
of Professor Gareth Carlyle.

04:07.932 --> 04:10.266
A Department
of Defense researcher

04:10.334 --> 04:13.052
and an expert on EMP.
Electromagnetic pulses.

04:13.137 --> 04:14.604
ERIC: Invisible blasts
of microwave energy

04:14.672 --> 04:16.523
that can destroy any piece
of electronic equipment.

04:16.607 --> 04:18.341
Don't you have to have
a nuclear weapon

04:18.392 --> 04:19.692
to create a pulse like that?

04:19.777 --> 04:21.677
That's how they discovered EMP's
in the '60s.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.730
Nuclear testing in the Pacific
knocked out street lights

04:23.814 --> 04:26.316
a thousand miles away
in Hawaii.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.618
ERIC: Carlyle's focus is on
non-nuclear EMP's.

04:28.686 --> 04:32.739
The man in black made off with
a 200-pound weapon prototype.

04:32.823 --> 04:34.157

- The missing weapon

04:35.910 --> 04:37.911

Compression Generator.

04:37.995 --> 04:38.912
Seriously?

04:38.996 --> 04:40.079
Let's hope he didn't

04:40.164 --> 04:43.032
drive away at 88 miles an hour
in his DeLorean.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.385

a Flux Capacitor.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.761

- Eric.

04:54.845 --> 04:56.846
Uh... the...

04:56.897 --> 04:58.815
flux has an explosive primer

04:58.882 --> 05:01.935
wrapped in a copper coil
which generates the pulse.

05:02.019 --> 05:04.270
It can take out a building's
worth of electronic gear.

05:04.355 --> 05:07.407
Computers, cell phones, car
ignitions, anything with a chip.

05:07.491 --> 05:10.393
It could cripple the air traffic
control tower at LAX,

05:31.515 --> 05:35.051
Yeah, I was chief engineer

05:35.102 --> 05:37.086
Not too many casualties
back then.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.721
Mainly humanitarian work.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.723
I-I helped bring her
to Haiti last year.

05:40.774 --> 05:44.260
So you have any idea who'd want
to get their hands on a flux?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.696
Usual suspects, I suppose.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.115
Drug cartels, anarchists,

05:49.199 --> 05:51.117
al Qaeda.
We're monitoring that.

05:51.201 --> 05:52.619
How hard is it to deploy?

05:52.703 --> 05:56.239
Easier than a car bomb and a
hell of a lot more destructive.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.267
Who knew you were working on it?

05:58.292 --> 06:00.486
A couple of staffers,
grad students.

06:00.487 --> 06:03.162
Anybody that showed a particular
interest in your work?

06:03.163 --> 06:04.497
I wish.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.166
Disinterest is, uh, more what
I'm up against.

06:07.251 --> 06:09.618
Well, what about other
researchers?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.504
Anybody who'd want to get
their hands on it?

06:11.588 --> 06:13.256
No, there's not a lot
of competition.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.008
Department of Defense
cut way back

Anyone who'd want
to hurt you?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.147
Uh, yeah, my wife.

06:21.231 --> 06:23.966
But she'd use the car bomb.
She's Irish.

06:24.018 --> 06:25.585
It's a bad joke.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.187
She's a bit of a fiery redhead,
and we're not together anymore.

06:28.272 --> 06:29.572
Um, I'm sorry, guys.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.924
I got a hundred students here
waiting for their last lecture

06:31.992 --> 06:34.694
of the semester. You guys are
welcome to sit in if you like.

06:34.778 --> 06:37.664
We'll take a rain check.

06:39.416 --> 06:41.534
Who needs a cup of 40-weight?

06:41.618 --> 06:42.952
- No, we're good.
- Yeah.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.871
So you're back
to work already?

06:44.955 --> 06:46.756
Never took a sick day.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.042
Not going to let a little ether
ruin that.

06:49.126 --> 06:51.094
So what'd you see?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.163
Stars, circling birdies.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.517
- Anything identifiable on the guy?
- Nothing.

06:57.601 --> 07:00.937
But I could for sure pick that
smooching co-ed out in a lineup.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.689
I figure they
were in on it.

07:02.773 --> 07:05.942
They got me away from my post
just long enough

07:06.009 --> 07:08.844
for that ninja attack.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.730
Okay, we'll be sure
to look into that, Columbo.

07:10.814 --> 07:13.032
Carlyle-- how long
have you known him?

07:13.117 --> 07:15.693
- 22 years.
- Wow.

07:15.694 --> 07:17.278
Did he ever get
into any fights?

07:17.304 --> 07:19.539
Arguments with co-workers?

07:19.623 --> 07:21.040
Nicest guy there is.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.242
These other professors--
they don't even know my name.

07:23.327 --> 07:24.994
He remembers my birthday,

07:25.045 --> 07:26.746
gets me a Christmas
present every year.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.498
It's a damn shame.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.167
What's a-- what's a damn shame?

07:31.218 --> 07:34.036
They say he didn't make tenure.
You know what that means.

07:34.088 --> 07:36.055
I do.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.708
(phone ringing)

07:41.645 --> 07:43.429
Eric, this better
be good news.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.064
No luck yet, Sam.
I'll stay on it.

07:45.149 --> 07:46.099
All right.

07:46.183 --> 07:47.350
Okay?
Yeah, keep trying.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.935
What?

07:49.019 --> 07:52.655
- He can't find a Parker Pony.
- If Eric can't find it, no one can.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.659
He couldn't find
my car either.

07:53.784 --> 07:55.084
Uh-huh.

07:55.526 --> 07:57.660
Is that who
I think it is?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.664
Thought he had a last
lecture to get to.

08:08.338 --> 08:09.738
Stairs.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.767
Smart guy.

08:20.851 --> 08:23.302
He used my elevator trick.

08:23.387 --> 08:24.804
What do you mean
your elevator trick?

08:24.888 --> 08:25.938
I made up that trick.

08:26.023 --> 08:29.108
Got to be
here somewhere.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.818
What happened to your lecture?

08:38.902 --> 08:42.205
I had to cancel it.
I-I-I have an emergency meeting

08:42.272 --> 08:43.706
at the Naval base
in San Diego.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.720
You always respond to
emergency meetings on

08:45.745 --> 08:46.945
your hands and knees?

08:47.211 --> 08:49.328
- No.
- You lied to us, Professor.

08:49.413 --> 08:52.298
Now would be a pretty good time
to start telling the truth.

08:52.382 --> 08:55.418
I... Yes, um... I-I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.220
Uh...

08:58.305 --> 09:00.723
The flux is in
the trunk of my car.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.625
You stole it from yourself?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.894
Yes, so I'd have an alibi.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.345
Why would you
need an alibi?

09:06.430 --> 09:08.097
The flux is set

09:08.148 --> 09:10.132
to discharge tonight.

09:10.184 --> 09:12.318
It'll take out the entire
Engineering Department.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.141
This thing isn't going to go
boom when I open it, right?

09:19.193 --> 09:20.576
No.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.086
Oh, God.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.755
I think we've
got a problem.

09:43.892 --> 09:45.962
The garage gets locked up
at midnight.

09:45.963 --> 09:48.598
Security makes their rounds
at 1:00 and at 3:00,

09:48.683 --> 09:50.967
so at 2:00 a.m.
no one gets hurt.

09:51.035 --> 09:53.419
You would have fried
every Engineering computer.

09:53.471 --> 09:55.722
That's major damage.

09:55.773 --> 09:57.395
Are you trying to get back
at the guys who didn't

09:57.420 --> 09:58.620
approve your tenure?

09:59.093 --> 10:02.112
No. No, I'm trying
to tell the world

10:02.196 --> 10:05.148
about the legitimacy
of an EMP threat.

10:05.232 --> 10:06.950
And you thought a practical
demonstration would do that?

10:07.034 --> 10:08.818
I've been trying
to tell them for 20 years.

10:08.903 --> 10:11.237
The government shut me down,
the university shut me down.

10:11.289 --> 10:13.540
I honestly didn't know
what else to do.

10:13.607 --> 10:15.158
Look--

10:15.242 --> 10:19.946
I screwed up, I know that, okay?
I screwed up big time, I get it.

10:19.997 --> 10:21.631
He was a star witness

10:21.716 --> 10:23.333
at the congressional
EMP threat hearings.

10:23.417 --> 10:25.385
Unfortunately, the
commission decided

10:25.452 --> 10:28.254
that EMP was a remote
possibility.

10:28.306 --> 10:30.223
Nothing to worry about.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.059
Our entire economy runs on
vulnerable electronics.

10:33.127 --> 10:35.562
But it would cost
billions to protect us.

10:35.629 --> 10:38.431
My dad's research is good.

10:38.482 --> 10:40.433
It's just being ignored.

10:40.484 --> 10:42.268
They cut off all
of his grant money.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.321
Is he working on anything new?

10:44.405 --> 10:48.975
You don't get grants,
you don't get tenure.

10:49.026 --> 10:50.527
Right.

10:50.611 --> 10:52.746
And you lose your job.

10:52.813 --> 10:54.981
He's lost weight.

10:55.032 --> 10:57.481
He looks terrible.

10:57.506 --> 10:58.810
When was the last
time you saw him?

10:59.560 --> 11:02.012
Maybe a month ago.

11:02.256 --> 11:08.928
When things got bad, it's like
his whole personality changed.

11:08.996 --> 11:11.514
We'd get in these huge fights
every night.

11:11.599 --> 11:14.050
He'd snap at us
over the tiniest things.

11:15.836 --> 11:18.104
I was kind of glad
when he moved out.

11:19.273 --> 11:21.057
How long are you
gonna keep him?

11:21.142 --> 11:22.192
When we're done,

11:22.276 --> 11:24.027
I'm afraid he's gonna have
to go to jail

11:24.111 --> 11:26.846
because of the assault
on the security guard.

11:29.516 --> 11:31.701
Doesn't really matter.

11:31.786 --> 11:35.288
We weren't even gonna have
Christmas together this year.

11:37.524 --> 11:39.793
CARLYLE:
That's your best shot.

11:39.860 --> 11:42.712
You have to find this thing,
do you understand me?

11:42.797 --> 11:46.332
In the wrong hands, the flux is
a disaster waiting to happen.

11:46.384 --> 11:49.502
I-I'll do anything
I can to help.

11:49.553 --> 11:51.871
How hard is it to reprogram?

11:51.922 --> 11:54.090
A TV repairman could do it.

11:54.175 --> 11:56.176
Who else knew you made it?

11:56.227 --> 11:57.260
Just a handful

11:57.344 --> 11:58.711
of my students, so...

12:02.316 --> 12:04.434
Names.

12:04.518 --> 12:06.686
Hamada Al-Aziz.

12:06.737 --> 12:08.054
He's a master's student.

12:08.105 --> 12:10.440
His uncle works
for a Somali charity.

12:10.524 --> 12:12.242
Seed Marshall...
"Seed"?

12:12.326 --> 12:14.444
Who names their kid Seed?

12:14.528 --> 12:16.012
KENSI:
He's cute.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.498
NELL: He's a Ph.D. candidate.
He was arrested

12:18.565 --> 12:20.366
for spiking trees in Oregon.

12:20.418 --> 12:22.535
Teaching assistant
Patrick Quade,

12:22.586 --> 12:25.438
he's got two unpaid
parking tickets.

12:25.506 --> 12:28.258
Ooh, that flux'll wipe 'em right
off his DMV record.

12:28.342 --> 12:30.877
Chester Wilkins and Bevan Tao.

12:30.928 --> 12:33.296
CALLEN: Learn
their names, Kensi.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.014
Nell has your college
transcript,

12:35.082 --> 12:37.050
your senior thesis
and your GRE results.

12:37.101 --> 12:39.302
You're going back
to school.

12:50.815 --> 12:51.981
Can I help you?

12:52.066 --> 12:53.283
Hey. I'm Kayla Glenn.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.784
I start the master's program
in January.

12:54.869 --> 12:56.119
MAN: Get a job
flipping burgers.

12:56.203 --> 12:58.655
- Save yourself two years of misery.
- (chuckles)

12:58.739 --> 13:00.940
It's a bad time. Our professor
took an unexpected leave

13:00.991 --> 13:04.244
of absence, and... final design
projects are due tomorrow.

13:04.295 --> 13:05.378
I'm Seed.

13:05.445 --> 13:06.329
Hi.

13:06.413 --> 13:07.747
- This is Bevan.
- Hey.

13:07.798 --> 13:08.548
Chester...
Hey.

13:08.615 --> 13:10.300
Hamada.
Hi.

13:10.384 --> 13:11.951
I'm sorry.
I don't shake hands with women.

13:12.002 --> 13:13.636
Okay, your loss.

13:13.721 --> 13:15.338
Where'd you do your undergrad?

13:15.422 --> 13:16.172
MIT.

13:16.257 --> 13:17.674
Intense. Who was your advisor?

13:17.758 --> 13:19.792
Steven Eppinger.

13:19.844 --> 13:21.094
Oh!

13:21.145 --> 13:22.979
The guy's a legend,
the guru of green design.

13:23.063 --> 13:26.332
Yeah. Oh, no way.
Is that a solar car?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.800
SEED: Designed
and built it.

13:27.852 --> 13:29.219
KENSI:
That is so cool.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.271
The working model's at the
proving ground in Palmdale.

13:31.322 --> 13:33.273
I'm going up there tomorrow.
I mean, I don't know

13:33.324 --> 13:34.858
if you're interested,
but... Hey!

13:34.942 --> 13:36.075
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:36.143 --> 13:37.911
Are you blind?

13:37.978 --> 13:40.864
No, no, not blind.
Just cleaning up trash.

13:42.283 --> 13:45.618
If you dweebs are staying up all
night, you need some nutrition.

13:45.669 --> 13:47.170
Hey, just be careful
with your crumbs.

13:47.254 --> 13:48.588
I just swept that whole area
yesterday.

13:48.655 --> 13:51.040
Patrick, this is Kayla.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.760
Hi. Delicious-looking tacos.

13:53.827 --> 13:56.880
Got chicken, beef
and vegetarian.

13:58.999 --> 14:02.852
"McCormick" and...

14:04.972 --> 14:06.606
Now let's see...

14:06.673 --> 14:09.309
(chuckles) No lock.

14:12.313 --> 14:14.697
Seed-- what a loser.

14:17.234 --> 14:19.652
Good almonds, though, huh?

14:27.995 --> 14:29.996
"Chester."

14:43.561 --> 14:45.678
Chester, Chester. Who knew?

14:49.650 --> 14:50.817
Wow.

14:50.884 --> 14:54.170
All right, let's see
what Eric makes of this.

14:54.238 --> 14:56.889
(text alert tone sounds)

14:56.957 --> 14:57.991
What's up, Deeks?

14:58.058 --> 14:59.993
Hey, Eric, I need your help
I.D.'ing

15:00.060 --> 15:01.578
this bad boy. You ready?

15:01.662 --> 15:03.830
Yep.

15:12.006 --> 15:16.159
M-47 incendiary bomb,
Vietnam era.

15:16.226 --> 15:18.628
Filled with either white
phosphorus or napalm.

15:18.712 --> 15:20.847
I'm sorry, did you
just say "napalm"?

15:20.914 --> 15:22.849
Or white phosphorous.

15:22.916 --> 15:25.051
Those particular bomb cases
leaked.

15:25.102 --> 15:26.519
They leaked?

15:26.586 --> 15:28.771
Yeah, so they never filled them
until right before

15:28.856 --> 15:32.275
they were loaded
onto the bombers.

15:32.359 --> 15:33.943
Okay, thank you, Eric.
That's good to know.

15:34.028 --> 15:35.545
No problemo.

15:35.613 --> 15:39.816
Whatever happened to keggers
and toga parties?

15:41.585 --> 15:43.486
Show me what you got.

15:43.554 --> 15:46.072
So far, we are
the highest bidder.

15:46.123 --> 15:48.241
Keep it that way.

15:48.292 --> 15:50.877
Got the garage video?

15:50.944 --> 15:53.129
About to roll.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.248
Carlyle's car, 10:00 a.m.

15:55.299 --> 15:57.383
SAM: While we were
still on campus.

15:57.451 --> 15:58.718
A Gremlin?

15:58.785 --> 16:00.553
That's the ugliest car
ever made.

16:01.889 --> 16:04.891
CALLEN:
A visit from St. Nick.

16:07.645 --> 16:10.263
That was fake snow.

16:10.314 --> 16:12.098
Somebody's got
the holiday spirit.

16:12.149 --> 16:15.735
Right, so if Santa has the flux,
we gotta find the Gremlin.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.987
DEEKS: So, uh, whole
rental car thing.

16:18.072 --> 16:19.272
Clearly you're going somewhere.

16:19.323 --> 16:20.273
Thinking about it.

16:20.324 --> 16:21.524
- Near or far?
- Far.

16:21.608 --> 16:22.525
Hot or cold?

16:22.609 --> 16:23.860
Warm.

16:23.944 --> 16:25.028
Alone or accompanied?
(sighs)

16:25.112 --> 16:26.979
You don't have
to answer that.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.114
(doorbell rings)

16:28.165 --> 16:30.583
Okay, I give up.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.702
Okay.

16:32.770 --> 16:35.955
Wait. What? No, I give up,
and then you tell me.

16:36.006 --> 16:38.374
Side door.

16:38.459 --> 16:40.293
You're not gonna tell me,
are you?

16:48.652 --> 16:50.636
KENSI:
Whoa!

16:50.688 --> 16:54.357
Something tells me that Chester
didn't get enough hugs.

16:54.441 --> 16:57.760
Yes, and that's exactly
where I keep my grenades,

16:57.828 --> 16:59.678
next to my crackers.

17:00.698 --> 17:03.483
DEEKS:
Is that a ballistic missile?

17:03.534 --> 17:05.151
(Kensi chuckles)

17:07.538 --> 17:09.855
(electric whirring)

17:09.906 --> 17:11.040
What the hell is that?

17:11.125 --> 17:13.242
I don't know, but it
doesn't sound good.

17:13.327 --> 17:16.244
(gasps) God!
Geez! Oh!

17:17.631 --> 17:19.098
It's a Tesla coil.

17:19.165 --> 17:20.333
A what?!

17:21.367 --> 17:22.719
Nikola Tesla?
The inventor

17:22.803 --> 17:23.836
of alternating current.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.387
Did you not take
high school physics?

17:25.472 --> 17:26.556
No, I was pretty much

17:26.623 --> 17:28.591
just focused
on Marci De Luka's skirt.

17:28.675 --> 17:30.476
Is... Is there an off
switch we just hit?

17:30.544 --> 17:32.512
No, we have to short it out.
We need water.

17:32.563 --> 17:35.014
Take off your shirt.

17:35.065 --> 17:36.566
- How's that?
- Take off your shirt.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.317
We'll wet it, we'll throw it,
it won't arc back.

17:40.554 --> 17:41.771
You got it.

17:41.855 --> 17:43.940
Except for the fact that we
don't have any liquids.

17:44.007 --> 17:47.110
Uh, urine's a good conductor.

17:47.194 --> 17:47.910
Okay, be my guest.

17:47.978 --> 17:49.862
I peed before we got here.

17:49.913 --> 17:50.997
- Really?
- Yes.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.284
You know what?
This isn't gonna work.

17:55.352 --> 17:57.186
I've got a shy bladder.

17:57.254 --> 17:59.172
Deeks, pee or perish!

17:59.239 --> 18:02.141
Hey, hey, look. Goldfish.
Ready? Go.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.267
I should take it.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.885
I played softball in college.
Thanks.

18:12.936 --> 18:14.253
I pitched hardball.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.723
In Little League.

18:19.226 --> 18:21.978
We make it out of this alive,
we're going to Australia.

18:22.062 --> 18:24.480
On three. One,

18:24.565 --> 18:26.532
two, three.

18:28.068 --> 18:29.068
(grunts)

18:30.904 --> 18:32.905
(descending whirring)

18:34.274 --> 18:35.941
(panting)

18:41.248 --> 18:43.499
I think I'm gonna need
a new shirt.

18:45.335 --> 18:46.785
(sighs)

18:55.174 --> 18:56.391
It's all inert ordnance.

18:56.476 --> 18:58.176
I turn bombs
into furniture

18:58.228 --> 18:59.762
for my Swords
into Plowshares project.

18:59.829 --> 19:00.846
What about
the Tesla Coil?

19:00.914 --> 19:02.281
I built it for class.

19:02.348 --> 19:05.367
Then my place got robbed.
Now it's my burglar alarm.

19:05.452 --> 19:07.586
You realize you could
kill someone, right?

19:07.654 --> 19:10.372
No. It's grounded, low
frequency. It's harmless.

19:10.457 --> 19:13.909
Just, uh... makes you pee your
pants and run away.

19:13.993 --> 19:16.295
(chuckles)
Am I right?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.050
You sit tight, Chester.

19:22.135 --> 19:24.636
Hey, if you, uh,

19:24.704 --> 19:26.505
if you want to go after
someone who'd mess

19:26.556 --> 19:28.724
with the flux,
go after Carlyle's assistant.

19:28.808 --> 19:30.759
She scares the crap out of me.

19:37.517 --> 19:41.403
So, what do we think
of Chester here?

19:41.488 --> 19:43.021
I don't think
he'd hurt a flea.

19:43.072 --> 19:44.439
Everything he said was true.

19:44.524 --> 19:46.241
What about your assistant?
Alexis?

19:46.326 --> 19:49.161
She's a bit of a rabid
animal rights activist.

19:49.228 --> 19:51.914
They have used a bomb
or two on research labs.

19:51.998 --> 19:54.199
Well, she trusts me.
I'll-I'll go talk to her.

19:54.250 --> 19:57.336
No, no. We appreciate it,
but you're in custody.

19:58.538 --> 20:00.455
Sorry, Mom,
it's just not a good time.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.207
We're really busy.

20:02.275 --> 20:05.861
Yeah, I mean, we're on the air
every day, even Christmas, so...

20:05.929 --> 20:08.664
Okay, well, just give
Grandma a hug for me,

20:08.731 --> 20:10.299
and I'll talk to you later.

20:10.366 --> 20:13.218
Sorry about that.
Um, we cross-referenced

20:13.269 --> 20:15.938
all university personnel
with the DMV.

20:16.022 --> 20:18.640
And found this little green guy

20:18.725 --> 20:21.360
registered to Jeremy Morlan,
Engineering major.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.779
Never commit a crime in
a Gremlin.

20:23.863 --> 20:25.898
Driving a Gremlin <i>is</i> a crime.

20:25.949 --> 20:27.533
Let's pay Jeremy a visit.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.100
Uh, that's gonna be difficult.

20:29.152 --> 20:31.537
He committed suicide last year
after graduation.

20:31.604 --> 20:35.123
Supposedly, his roommate donated
his car to charity.

20:35.208 --> 20:36.274
Who's his roommate?

20:36.326 --> 20:38.043
NELL: One of our other
grad students,

20:38.110 --> 20:39.878
Hamada Al-Aziz.
He's in Sherman Oaks.

20:39.946 --> 20:42.748
You know what the 405 is like
this time of day?

20:42.799 --> 20:46.251
Run a financial check on
Carlyle's associates,

20:46.302 --> 20:47.953
keep looking
for that Gremlin.

20:48.004 --> 20:50.672
Don't let
that pony get away.

20:50.757 --> 20:53.392
(cell phone buzzes) Aw, shoot,
it's my mom again.

20:53.459 --> 20:55.310
She's wondering why
everyone's home

20:55.395 --> 20:57.813
except me for Christmas.
What do you tell them?

20:57.897 --> 20:58.981
Uh, working.

20:59.065 --> 21:01.066
I'm a TV news editor.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.100
Hmm.
What about you?

21:02.151 --> 21:04.853
Professional blackjack player.

21:04.938 --> 21:05.988
Really?

21:06.072 --> 21:07.472
True.

21:07.523 --> 21:10.525
Until I got banned from Vegas.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.444
NELL: Sorry, Deeks.
- Okay, yeah, we're on our way back.

21:12.495 --> 21:13.445
- Okay.
- Thanks.

21:13.496 --> 21:14.830
What happened?

21:14.914 --> 21:17.115
Dead end. Carlyle's assistant
spent the whole day yesterday

21:17.166 --> 21:20.168
in the ER after she was bit
trying to liberate a chimp.

21:20.253 --> 21:23.255
Although we do have a bunch of
texts to her from Bevan Tao.

21:23.322 --> 21:26.008
KENSI:
Urasawa? How the hell

21:26.075 --> 21:28.210
does a grad student
afford $800 sushi?

21:28.294 --> 21:30.212
It's a good question.
Nell's looking into it.

21:30.296 --> 21:32.781
Speaking of primo sushi,

21:32.849 --> 21:35.217
probably gonna find
some of that in Hawaii.

21:35.301 --> 21:36.885
Have you been on my computer?

21:36.970 --> 21:38.437
No, I'm just using

21:38.504 --> 21:40.188
my excellent powers
of deduction.

21:40.273 --> 21:41.273
Or maybe it's a wild guess.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.558
A wild guess you
just confirmed.

21:43.643 --> 21:45.777
What? Come on. All right,
you stay at a nice hotel,

21:45.845 --> 21:46.979
I'll crash on the beach.

21:47.030 --> 21:48.179
I'll show you
all the places

21:48.231 --> 21:49.314
the locals go.
<i>Mele Kalikimaka.</i>

21:49.365 --> 21:50.983
It's the thing to say.

21:51.034 --> 21:52.350
You know
what that means?

21:52.402 --> 21:54.152
"Merry Christmas."
I'm going alone.

21:54.203 --> 21:55.570
You know what that means?

21:55.655 --> 21:57.022
Hmm... means I'm gonna
pick you up

21:57.073 --> 21:58.189
at the airport
when you get back?

21:58.241 --> 21:59.658
That would be nice.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.627
Secret lady business?

22:01.694 --> 22:03.528
Something like that.

22:06.699 --> 22:07.633
Hey, everybody!

22:07.700 --> 22:09.635
ALL:
Hi, Nell!

22:09.702 --> 22:12.304
(chuckles)
Oh, so good to see you, dear.

22:12.371 --> 22:13.722
You look great.

22:13.806 --> 22:15.140
So do you, Ma.

22:15.207 --> 22:17.759
Man, I wish I could be there.

22:17.844 --> 22:19.761
It's not too late
to hop on a plane.

22:19.846 --> 22:21.930
Kaleidoscope is
running the Gremlin.

22:22.015 --> 22:24.099
- Uh, who's that, honey?
- Uh, that's...

22:24.183 --> 22:26.435
Eric.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.571
Oh. Oh, oh, we've heard so much
about you.

22:29.656 --> 22:31.156
Hi.

22:31.223 --> 22:32.941
Hey. Wait...
Okay, gotta go, Mom.

22:33.026 --> 22:33.942
Bye.

22:34.027 --> 22:35.277
(sighs)

22:35.361 --> 22:36.945
Did I just meet your parents?

22:37.030 --> 22:38.280
I guess so.

22:38.348 --> 22:41.249
What have they
heard about me?

22:41.334 --> 22:42.584
Well...

22:42.652 --> 22:43.919
(Kaleidoscope beeps)

22:44.003 --> 22:45.120
Ooh, you got a hit.

22:45.204 --> 22:46.455
You'd better call Sam.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.006
It's in Hollywood.

22:48.074 --> 22:50.042
(cell phone ringing)

22:52.712 --> 22:53.628
Go, Eric.

22:53.713 --> 22:54.629
We found it.

22:54.714 --> 22:55.714
We actually found it.

22:55.765 --> 22:56.882
The Pony?

22:56.933 --> 22:58.550
No, not the Pony.

22:58.601 --> 23:00.719
The Gremlin.

23:00.770 --> 23:01.553
(scoffs)

23:01.604 --> 23:03.438
Well, at least I got my wish.

23:03.523 --> 23:05.524
♪ ♪

23:15.535 --> 23:17.119
Slim pickings.

23:17.203 --> 23:18.453
That's what happens

23:18.538 --> 23:20.789
when you wait
till the last second to shop.

23:20.873 --> 23:22.374
Same thing goes for toys.

23:22.441 --> 23:23.525
What?

23:23.593 --> 23:25.610
Come on. Could be some
prints on the door.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.715
Who locks a Gremlin?

23:29.782 --> 23:31.633
Hmm.

23:31.718 --> 23:33.785
(cell phone ringing)

23:33.836 --> 23:35.120
Yeah?

23:35.171 --> 23:36.822
ERIC:
Auction ends in 30 minutes.

23:36.889 --> 23:37.973
Can I go up on your bid?

23:38.057 --> 23:39.224
How much?

23:39.291 --> 23:40.892
I think we'll win at 500.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.894
For a little toy pony?

23:42.962 --> 23:43.979
Do it.

23:44.063 --> 23:45.680
(typing)

23:45.765 --> 23:46.732
(computer chimes)

23:46.799 --> 23:48.266
(horse neighs,
cash register rings)

23:48.334 --> 23:50.268
You taking money
from the mob?

23:50.319 --> 23:52.487
Let's just say
I'm a man of my word,

23:52.572 --> 23:55.157
who's going to be eating
peanut butter sandwiches

23:55.241 --> 23:56.825
for the next couple
of months.

23:56.909 --> 23:59.027
You're still coming over for
Christmas dinner, right?

23:59.112 --> 24:01.279
Not if you're serving
peanut butter sandwiches.

24:01.330 --> 24:03.031
This is hot.

24:03.116 --> 24:04.366
What, hot?

24:04.450 --> 24:06.418
It's getting hotter.

24:06.485 --> 24:07.552
(grunts)

24:07.620 --> 24:09.104
(explosion)

24:12.442 --> 24:13.775
You ever seen a car do that?

24:13.843 --> 24:14.793
Once.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.011
In training.

24:16.095 --> 24:18.296
Who was training you?

24:18.347 --> 24:20.215
A chemist.

24:22.001 --> 24:25.470
And we are winning
in three, two...

24:25.521 --> 24:27.305
one.

24:27.373 --> 24:28.573
(cash register rings)

24:28.641 --> 24:29.558
(horse neighs)
No.

24:29.642 --> 24:30.892
(buzzing)
No, no, no.

24:30.977 --> 24:32.527
I don't believe this;
this can't be happening.

24:32.595 --> 24:34.896
Someone sniped us with
a thousand-dollar bid.

24:34.981 --> 24:39.484
Eric, auction's over.
Tell me we got it.

24:39.535 --> 24:41.153
Have you considered Legos?

24:42.354 --> 24:43.719
SAM: How about
I break your Leg-os?

24:43.744 --> 24:44.823
Sorry.

24:44.824 --> 24:49.411
So, the preliminary arson
report on the Gremlin is in.

24:49.495 --> 24:52.416
It was nitrocellulose
plastic, spontaneously

24:52.441 --> 24:53.215
combusting with water.

24:53.216 --> 24:55.834
Probably triggered when you
pulled the door latch.

24:55.885 --> 24:59.537
Guys, there's just been another
break-in at Carlyle's lab.

24:59.589 --> 25:01.223
They stole a vircator.

25:01.307 --> 25:02.557
ERIC:
Oh, boy.

25:02.642 --> 25:03.892
What the hell's a vircator?

25:03.976 --> 25:05.560
ERIC:
When it's used with a flux,

25:05.645 --> 25:08.580
a vircator acts
as a kind of amplifier.

25:08.648 --> 25:11.349
It takes what would be a
localized electromagnetic pulse

25:11.400 --> 25:13.485
and turns it
into something much bigger.

25:13.552 --> 25:14.486
How much bigger?

25:14.553 --> 25:15.687
(sighs)

25:15.738 --> 25:17.939
Big enough
to kiss Los Angeles good-bye.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.638
The vircator completes
an electromagnetic device

25:36.706 --> 25:37.973
or "EMD."

25:38.058 --> 25:41.477
Fits on three shipping pallets,
weighs close to a ton.

25:41.561 --> 25:42.845
Professor?

25:42.929 --> 25:44.847
When the flux
feeds a vircator,

25:44.931 --> 25:48.267
the antenna emits 30,000
volts of microwave energy

25:48.318 --> 25:49.601
over nine miles.

25:49.652 --> 25:51.603
I guess my surge
protector won't help.

25:51.671 --> 25:53.021
Are people hurt by the pulse?

25:53.106 --> 25:55.023
No, not unless
they have a pacemaker.

25:55.091 --> 25:57.493
How can a nine-mile hit
destroy the state?

25:57.577 --> 26:00.863
Well, in the target zone--
computers, cell phones, cars--

26:00.947 --> 26:03.565
anything with a circuit
board dies immediately.

26:03.633 --> 26:05.567
Then you lose electricity.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.369
Power plants are run
by microchips.

26:07.454 --> 26:09.671
Fry enough nodes,
the whole system goes down.

26:09.739 --> 26:12.458
25 million people
without power.

26:12.509 --> 26:13.459
For how long?

26:13.510 --> 26:14.626
A month or two.

26:14.677 --> 26:16.011
If we're lucky.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.797
Yeah. Hospitals only have
backup power for 24 hours.

26:18.848 --> 26:20.999
Yeah, and then there's
loss of water pressure,

26:21.050 --> 26:22.351
water purification...

26:22.435 --> 26:24.686
Toilets back up.
No refrigeration,

26:24.771 --> 26:27.389
no food delivery
to the grocery stores.

26:27.474 --> 26:29.591
People get hungry,
they get violent.

26:29.659 --> 26:30.692
So, rioting and trauma,

26:30.777 --> 26:32.978
dehydration and starvation
and disease.

26:33.029 --> 26:36.982
I'll be on the phone
with Washington.

26:37.033 --> 26:40.068
Don't make me
cancel Christmas.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.038
I was trying to alert people

26:43.123 --> 26:45.224
to the real threat of something
like this happening.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.326
Instead, I've set the whole
thing into motion.

26:47.377 --> 26:48.577
How can they get it to altitude?

26:48.661 --> 26:50.129
A suicide bomber
in a private plane?

26:50.196 --> 26:51.380
It's too heavy.

26:51.464 --> 26:53.916
You have to drop it from a cargo
jet with a tailgate.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.084
Excuse me.
Did Hamada work on the vircator?

26:56.169 --> 26:58.587
Yes, actually, he did last
summer, for a while. Why?

26:58.671 --> 27:00.889
Well, I've got a Lockheed
Tristar at LAX

27:00.974 --> 27:02.808
leased to his uncle's
Somalian charity,

27:02.875 --> 27:03.875
departing tonight.

27:05.395 --> 27:07.062
Maybe not.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.398
That thing is huge.

27:09.482 --> 27:11.400
How would you get that
to the plane?

27:11.484 --> 27:13.318
With a truck.

27:13.386 --> 27:14.386
Do any grad students
own a truck?

27:14.437 --> 27:16.605
Bevan Tao rented one
two days ago.

27:16.689 --> 27:19.274
And I show a spike in cell calls
between Hamada and Bevan Tao.

27:19.359 --> 27:21.276
The same Bevan
who enjoys expensive sushi?

27:21.361 --> 27:22.845
NELL:
He can afford it.

27:22.912 --> 27:26.615
Deposit of $4,000
into his checking account today.

27:26.699 --> 27:28.283
I'm thinking cash for weapons.

27:28.368 --> 27:30.285
Maybe they're going to sell it.

27:30.353 --> 27:32.120
Maybe they already have.

27:41.598 --> 27:42.881
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:42.932 --> 27:44.766
- Can I come in?
- Well, I told you to call me

27:44.851 --> 27:47.019
if you had any questions;
I didn't think you'd...

27:47.086 --> 27:48.387
Hello.

27:48.438 --> 27:50.022
You're hanging out
with the janitor?

27:50.089 --> 27:51.190
Oh!
That hurts.

27:51.257 --> 27:52.741
Federal agents.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.444
That's a nice flatscreen.

27:55.528 --> 27:57.863
Uh, it's a Christmas present
from my dad.

27:57.930 --> 27:58.864
Where's your moving truck?

27:58.931 --> 28:00.699
I returned it.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.175
Your buddy Hamada
give you a hand with that?

28:02.176 --> 28:03.206
He's not my friend.

28:03.231 --> 28:04.431
You've been calling
him a lot.

28:04.571 --> 28:06.622
He's my lab partner
in nano-optics.

28:06.706 --> 28:08.657
So you're working with him?

28:08.741 --> 28:11.293
That was a big bank
deposit you made today.

28:11.361 --> 28:13.078
That's my tutoring money.

28:13.129 --> 28:15.080
Wow!
Four grand?

28:15.131 --> 28:17.132
If you get a rich kid into
an Ivy League school,

28:17.217 --> 28:19.384
your rates go up to 300 an hour.
KENSI: Super interesting.

28:19.452 --> 28:20.752
What's his name?
Um...

28:20.803 --> 28:22.754
Johnny.

28:22.805 --> 28:23.755
Can we get an address?

28:23.806 --> 28:25.624
For, um... Johnny?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.961
You're really a federal agent?

28:34.234 --> 28:35.150
(beeping)

28:35.235 --> 28:36.485
We have a schedule.

28:36.569 --> 28:38.320
We need to get all of this
on the plane.

28:38.404 --> 28:39.488
Sorry.

28:39.572 --> 28:41.607
Why are we being singled out?

28:41.658 --> 28:43.358
Do you do this
to the Red Cross?

28:43.443 --> 28:44.993
To Doctors
Without Borders?

28:45.078 --> 28:47.079
(speaking Arabic)

28:54.120 --> 28:56.121
Bunch of canned food.

28:57.106 --> 28:59.291
Some medical supplies.

28:59.342 --> 29:02.177
No sign of the EMD.

29:06.516 --> 29:08.467
There's clothes.

29:08.518 --> 29:10.018
Toys.

29:10.103 --> 29:12.170
Nice try, but I think
these guys are legit.

29:12.221 --> 29:13.388
Did you say toys?

29:13.473 --> 29:15.390
Yeah.

29:15.475 --> 29:18.727
Trust me, there is no
Parker Pony in this box.

29:18.811 --> 29:20.445
Okay, and even if there was,

29:20.513 --> 29:24.283
you really gonna take it
from a needy child?

29:24.350 --> 29:25.367
Really?

29:25.451 --> 29:29.237
I'll leave money
in the box, G. I...

29:29.322 --> 29:30.956
Hamada's hard drive is clean.

29:31.023 --> 29:32.608
As is his airport
warehouse.

29:32.675 --> 29:34.409
And Bevan still
isn't talking.

29:34.477 --> 29:36.411
Yeah, well, see if
he can explain this.

29:36.496 --> 29:40.248
After Bevan moved, T.A. Patrick
Quade drove another 20 miles.

29:40.333 --> 29:42.334
What do Bevan and Patrick
have in common?

29:42.385 --> 29:45.220
Close to $200,000
in student loans.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.339
What's the job market like
for these guys?

29:47.390 --> 29:49.474
Ah, it's pretty dismal.

29:49.542 --> 29:52.311
Only 15% of new grads
find jobs in their field.

29:52.378 --> 29:54.396
That's why Jeremy Morlan
took his life.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.581
I've found recent grads working
as waiters, bartenders.

29:56.649 --> 29:59.851
Even Patrick Quade pulls night
shifts as a security guard.

29:59.919 --> 30:01.103
Okay. Where does he work?

30:01.187 --> 30:03.238
Office buildings, loading docks,
wherever they need him.

30:03.323 --> 30:06.074
What if you could wipe out
your entire educational debt

30:06.159 --> 30:07.609
in one night?
Banks keep backup

30:07.694 --> 30:09.778
files in remote locations,
so that wouldn't work.

30:09.862 --> 30:12.063
No, no, no, I'm talking
about raising cash.

30:12.115 --> 30:14.065
You know, you hit
the Diamond District

30:14.117 --> 30:15.417
or... a fine art gallery.

30:15.501 --> 30:17.902
DEEKS: You know what,
follow my lie.

30:19.706 --> 30:22.124
(door opens)

30:22.208 --> 30:23.842
Patrick Quade
drove your truck.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.844
He wanted to borrow it.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.796
Why is that?
(sighs)

30:27.880 --> 30:29.881
Well, Patrick's
in custody,

30:29.932 --> 30:32.050
and he told us how he
moved the EMD, so...

30:32.101 --> 30:33.885
Wow. You know
what that makes you?

30:33.936 --> 30:35.387
An accessory to a felony.

30:35.438 --> 30:36.388
What is that now?

30:36.439 --> 30:37.689
Is that 15 years?

30:37.757 --> 30:39.858
KENSI: I think it's closer to 20.
- 20!

30:39.925 --> 30:43.061
That is a lot of showering;
you are not gonna make it in ten.

30:44.864 --> 30:47.149
He paid me four grand
to borrow the truck

30:47.233 --> 30:48.734
and to keep my mouth shut.

30:48.785 --> 30:50.569
I wouldn't be part
of the robbery.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.320
When's it going down?
Why don't you ask him?

30:52.405 --> 30:54.306
Why don't I ask...?
You know what?

30:54.374 --> 30:56.291
I got that D.A.,
probably get him 50.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.542
- She's great.
- Yeah.

30:57.610 --> 30:58.543
Yeah.

30:58.611 --> 31:00.545
Tonight at midnight.

31:00.613 --> 31:02.214
Some bank downtown.

31:02.281 --> 31:03.615
That's all he said.

31:04.967 --> 31:06.051
Wait. Do I get a lawyer?

31:06.118 --> 31:07.052
KENSI: I don't know.

31:07.119 --> 31:09.054
Have you been naughty
or nice?

31:09.121 --> 31:10.722
DEEKS:
Ten bucks on naughty.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.224
CARLYLE:
<i>Those idiots think</i>

31:12.291 --> 31:14.059
they can control the
cone, but you can't.

31:14.126 --> 31:16.478
The power lines act like
antennas; the pulse will travel

31:16.562 --> 31:20.649
through to hospitals, police
stations, fire departments.

31:20.733 --> 31:21.683
People are going to die.

31:21.768 --> 31:24.352
Okay, 55 minutes to midnight.

31:24.437 --> 31:26.488
CARLYLE:
We're running out of time.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.709
Cap crimper,
socket wrench set.

31:38.794 --> 31:40.044
- All non-magnetic?
- Yeah.

31:40.128 --> 31:42.046
Correct.
The FAA is grounding all flights

31:42.130 --> 31:44.499
coming in and out of LAX
at 23:30.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.501
No, no, it's more than
a blackout, Doctor.

31:46.552 --> 31:48.536
We're talking about ventilators,
pacemakers, dialysis machines

31:48.587 --> 31:49.670
all quitting at once.

31:49.721 --> 31:51.389
- Let's do this.
- All right. Thanks, Doc.

31:51.473 --> 31:52.924
Okay, we'll keep in touch.

31:53.008 --> 31:56.294
There are 59 banks
in downtown L.A.

31:56.361 --> 31:58.412
- We've narrowed it down to a dozen.
- All in high-rise buildings

31:58.480 --> 32:00.181
because you need altitude
for the EMP to hit the ground

32:00.232 --> 32:02.099
with a big enough cone.
Mr. Callen,

32:02.184 --> 32:03.401
Mr. Hanna,

32:03.485 --> 32:05.069
should you find
yourselves on the roof,

32:05.153 --> 32:07.238
there will be no air support.

32:07.306 --> 32:10.691
A helicopter will drop like
a stone in any EMP.

32:10.742 --> 32:12.610
I hope you have a plan B,

32:12.694 --> 32:15.246
if you can't stop this
thing from firing.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.747
Sam's working on plan B.

32:16.832 --> 32:18.783
I'm working on plan A;
you're in charge of plan B.

32:19.901 --> 32:21.953
We're still working on plan B.

32:22.037 --> 32:23.204
Is that so?

32:23.272 --> 32:24.422
Well, I hope

32:24.489 --> 32:27.508
it doesn't involve me
identifying both of you

32:27.576 --> 32:29.193
from your dental records.

32:31.179 --> 32:33.581
Come on.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.351
(tires screeching)

32:38.604 --> 32:40.555
Eric, we're two minutes out.

32:40.606 --> 32:41.856
We need that building.

32:41.923 --> 32:43.257
All right, we're down
to five buildings--

32:43.308 --> 32:45.810
three of them grouped within
two blocks of each other.

32:45.894 --> 32:47.028
What about this one
on Sixth Street?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.479
Not high enough.

32:48.564 --> 32:50.865
20 stories or higher or it's not
going to work effectively.

32:58.907 --> 33:00.875
♪ ♪

33:05.614 --> 33:08.165
I got a bad feeling
about this.

33:08.250 --> 33:11.052
Look on the bright side.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.304
You could be stuck in a mall
fighting crowds

33:13.388 --> 33:15.306
trying to find your pony.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.924
That's what I'm talking about.

33:16.975 --> 33:19.176
I got a bad feeling I'm not
gonna find one.

33:19.261 --> 33:22.313
Well, maybe Santa Claus will
bring it to her.

33:22.397 --> 33:24.265
Maybe I'll tell her

33:24.316 --> 33:26.150
Uncle Callen said
he'd get it for her.

33:26.234 --> 33:28.319
"It's okay, baby girl,

33:28.403 --> 33:31.522
Uncle Callen didn't mean
to let you down."

33:31.607 --> 33:33.324
That's messed up.
You wouldn't.

33:33.408 --> 33:34.709
You shouldn't.

33:34.776 --> 33:36.444
Ho-ho-ho.

33:36.511 --> 33:38.779
(computer beeps)
I got something.

33:38.830 --> 33:40.181
On a rooftop,

33:40.248 --> 33:41.532
looks like building supplies.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.200
Nell, can you check the bank's
security feeds?

33:43.285 --> 33:44.318
Yeah.

33:45.654 --> 33:48.489
We're all out of time,
Mr. Beale.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.826
NELL: Side alley, guy in
a motorcycle helmet.

33:54.229 --> 33:56.380
Other one's
a bank security guard.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.599
Our target is National Bank,
Spring Street.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.635
Less than half a block
from your current location.

34:00.686 --> 34:02.470
We're on the move.

34:02.521 --> 34:04.972
Access via the alley on the west
side of the street.

34:05.023 --> 34:07.191
Two targets: one guy in
a motorcycle helmet,

34:07.275 --> 34:09.694
the other's
a bank security guard.

34:16.518 --> 34:18.351
CALLEN: Kensi, Deeks, check
the lobby.

34:18.402 --> 34:20.487
Sam and I are headed
to the roof.

34:37.639 --> 34:38.723
Federal agents.

34:38.806 --> 34:40.174
On the ground now.

34:41.543 --> 34:42.610
Ooh!

34:42.678 --> 34:43.561
Kensi!

34:43.645 --> 34:45.563
I got him.

34:45.630 --> 34:46.496
Drop it!

34:46.565 --> 34:48.683
(grunting)

34:55.690 --> 34:57.408
You got any other weapons, huh?

34:57.492 --> 35:00.561
Maybe a slide ruler?
Maybe a pointy compass?

35:02.731 --> 35:04.398
No one was gonna get hurt.

35:04.449 --> 35:06.233
Yeah? Well, not a lot

35:06.284 --> 35:08.402
of veggie tacos in the pen,
huh, Patrick?

35:11.373 --> 35:13.591
(panting)

35:13.675 --> 35:15.459
Nell, close up
the parking garage!

35:15.544 --> 35:16.677
Got it.

35:25.854 --> 35:28.222
SAM: They must have used
the freight elevator,

35:28.273 --> 35:30.391
assembled it up here.

35:30.442 --> 35:32.109
CALLEN:
It's got a timer.

35:32.177 --> 35:33.594
It's counting down.

35:33.645 --> 35:34.645
We got seven minutes...

35:34.730 --> 35:36.564
We got a visual.

35:36.615 --> 35:39.316
All right, this is not exactly a
"green wire, red wire" situation.

35:39.401 --> 35:42.486
Sorry, guys, you're gonna have
to disassemble this one.

35:42.571 --> 35:44.872
First pallet, power supply,

35:44.939 --> 35:47.041
flux is in the middle,
then the vircator.

35:47.108 --> 35:50.778
So removing the power supply is
like unhooking a car battery.

35:57.169 --> 35:59.904
(grunts)

35:59.971 --> 36:01.305
Come on.

36:01.389 --> 36:02.506
(grunts)

36:02.591 --> 36:04.508
We need more torque.
Need a bigger wrench.

36:04.593 --> 36:06.093
Let me try.
Be my guest.

36:10.732 --> 36:12.516
Liquid nitrogen?

36:12.601 --> 36:14.769
Works every time.

36:14.820 --> 36:15.903
There you go.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.272
I'll take care of this.
You work on Plan B.

36:21.276 --> 36:23.577
Federal agent!
Stop! Stop now!

36:25.614 --> 36:27.531
DEEKS:
Kensi, where are you?

36:27.616 --> 36:28.816
I'm on the second floor.

36:40.796 --> 36:42.763
Hands behind your back.

36:46.768 --> 36:48.686
(grunts)

36:48.770 --> 36:50.387
Seed, didn't recognize you

36:50.472 --> 36:52.223
without your Birkenstocks.

36:52.307 --> 36:53.507
Why'd you do it?

36:53.558 --> 36:57.444
Why? Because we gave
eight years to higher education

36:57.512 --> 36:59.814
with no promise of a job
or nothing.

36:59.865 --> 37:01.699
We were just taking back
from some billionaire bankers

37:01.783 --> 37:03.150
who never even
deserved a bailout.

37:03.201 --> 37:05.820
Yeah, the rich get richer
and the dumb get dumber.

37:05.871 --> 37:08.706
Last one there.
What next?

37:08.790 --> 37:10.040
All right,
pull off the power supply.

37:10.125 --> 37:11.959
This way's blocked.
We gotta go this way.

37:12.026 --> 37:13.627
One, two, three...

37:13.695 --> 37:16.247
(both grunting)

37:20.869 --> 37:23.671
An inch off
the power supply.

37:23.722 --> 37:26.707
No, it needs to be more.
It can still arc across the gap.

37:29.210 --> 37:30.344
It's less than a minute!

37:30.395 --> 37:32.396
Guys, you are not going
to make it!

37:32.480 --> 37:33.347
What are you doing?

37:33.398 --> 37:34.899
Using the liquid nitrogen.

37:34.983 --> 37:38.018
I want to make sure this thing
blows before it can trigger.

37:38.069 --> 37:40.237
We're gonna have to go plan B.
I hate plan B.

37:40.322 --> 37:42.106
(hissing)

37:42.190 --> 37:43.440
(gasps)

37:43.525 --> 37:45.693
CALLEN:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:06.298 --> 38:07.348
Really?

38:07.415 --> 38:08.966
The longest rope we had.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.268
- This is why I hate plan B.
- I'm sorry, we should have made

38:11.353 --> 38:13.103
a little pit stop at REI.
We could have picked you up

38:13.188 --> 38:16.223
some granola bars, too.
- (cell phone rings) Huh!

38:16.274 --> 38:17.858
You gonna answer that?

38:20.862 --> 38:24.031
(ringing continues,
Sam grunting)

38:26.401 --> 38:27.651
It's Hetty.

38:27.736 --> 38:29.286
You want to take it?

38:29.371 --> 38:30.604
She's calling you, not me.

38:34.376 --> 38:36.126
Hello.

38:36.211 --> 38:38.779
Congratulations, gentlemen.

38:38.830 --> 38:40.464
Next time, you might want

38:40.548 --> 38:42.549
to think about packing
your parachutes.

38:42.617 --> 38:45.052
(sirens approaching)

38:45.119 --> 38:46.637
You getting hungry?

38:46.721 --> 38:47.838
Shut up.

38:47.923 --> 38:49.957
(chuckles)

38:54.562 --> 38:57.314
Thank you, Wesley.

38:57.399 --> 38:59.299
LAPD is waiting.

39:01.653 --> 39:06.273
You know, uh,
I'm not a bad man, Detective.

39:06.324 --> 39:08.609
What I did was misguided.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.693
It was wrong.

39:09.778 --> 39:13.163
- But I'm not a bad man.
- Hmm.

39:13.248 --> 39:14.832
Could you, uh... please

39:14.916 --> 39:16.583
get a message to my daughter
for me?

39:16.651 --> 39:19.536
No, I can't.

39:21.289 --> 39:23.657
But you can tell her yourself.

39:29.330 --> 39:30.597
Hey, Dad.

39:30.665 --> 39:33.467
Sara...

39:42.360 --> 39:45.195
(sobs softly)
I love you, Daddy.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.514
I love you, too.

39:56.207 --> 39:57.658
Ah! Ooh!

39:57.709 --> 40:00.711
This is Theakston's
Christmas Ale

40:00.795 --> 40:04.031
flown all the way from
Yorkshire, England,

40:04.082 --> 40:08.302
and brewed as it was in
Charles Dickens' time.

40:08.369 --> 40:09.803
Carlyle got turned over
to the LAPD.

40:09.871 --> 40:11.171
Not for long.

40:11.222 --> 40:14.475
We posted bail so he could spend
Christmas with his family.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.760
Really?

40:16.828 --> 40:19.129
We felt he'd righted his wrong.

40:19.197 --> 40:21.882
Needless to say, with
the events of the past day,

40:21.933 --> 40:24.401
there's a flood of
interest in his work.

40:24.486 --> 40:27.521
Can't drink on an
empty stomach.

40:27.572 --> 40:29.406
(Kensi gasps)

40:29.491 --> 40:30.607
Sig Sauers and Glocks.

40:30.692 --> 40:31.775
SAM:
Amazing.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.694
Wait. Did you bake
these in the microwave?

40:33.745 --> 40:35.779
I actually reconfigured

40:35.864 --> 40:37.915
the burn room incinerator
as a convection oven.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.333
Smart girl.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.200
Uh, Sam?

40:40.251 --> 40:41.618
Hmm?

40:41.703 --> 40:43.921
Got a little something for you.

40:44.005 --> 40:46.373
How'd you find it?

40:46.424 --> 40:48.092
Don't ask.

40:48.176 --> 40:49.877
You saved my ass.

40:49.928 --> 40:52.412
(chuckles)

40:52.464 --> 40:54.681
- I actually got something for you, too.
- For me?

40:54.749 --> 40:57.885
Yeah. It's a gift
for the tropical sun.

40:57.936 --> 41:00.971
It's made by a woman in Venice
for a very select clientele.

41:01.056 --> 41:02.222
It's hypoallergenic,

41:02.273 --> 41:07.227
made with organic coconut oil,
shea butter and jojoba.

41:07.278 --> 41:11.098
So I thought that you would,
uh, like it.

41:11.149 --> 41:13.934
Wow.

41:13.985 --> 41:14.985
Thank you.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.571
Have fun on your trip.

41:17.622 --> 41:19.656
I may come by on Christmas.

41:19.741 --> 41:22.126
I want to see what
this little pony actually does.

41:22.210 --> 41:23.327
(chuckles)

41:25.246 --> 41:27.581
That was very generous
of you.

41:27.632 --> 41:30.617
I happen to know you procured
that winged little pony

41:30.668 --> 41:33.170
for yourself at Comic-Con
last summer.

41:33.254 --> 41:35.339
You did?

41:35.423 --> 41:39.676
Mr. Beale has quite the fantasy
action figure collection.

41:39.761 --> 41:41.461
(chuckles) You do?

41:41.513 --> 41:43.263
A toast!

41:43.314 --> 41:44.898
To friends

41:44.966 --> 41:47.901
and the family we have...

41:47.969 --> 41:48.986
SAM:
Hear, hear.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.637
HETTY:
Hear, hear.
