WEBVTT

00:20.654 --> 00:23.924
( soft music playing )

00:32.766 --> 00:35.103
Man's voice:
I USED TO DREAM ABOUT FLYING.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.938
IT WENT THE SAME WAY
EVERY NIGHT--

00:37.938 --> 00:40.274
I'D REALIZE
THAT I COULD FLY--

00:40.274 --> 00:42.110
NO, THAT'S NOT
QUITE RIGHT.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.945
I'D REALIZE THAT THERE WAS
NO REASON I COULDN'T FLY.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.282
AND AFTER THAT,
I'D FLOAT OFF THE GROUND

00:48.282 --> 00:50.784
AND SOAR ABOVE THE CITY.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.287
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD
THAT DREAM IN A WHILE NOW.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.457
LATELY I DREAM ABOUT
MORE ORDINARY THINGS

00:56.457 --> 00:59.460
LIKE DOING MY LAUNDRY
OR SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES

00:59.460 --> 01:01.962
OR RIDING ON ELEVATORS.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.232
I WONDER
WHY THAT IS.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.490
Man:
DRUG USE, PRESCRIPTION
OR OTHERWISE?

02:02.490 --> 02:04.158
NO.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.160
DO YOU EXPERIENCE
PERSISTENT HEADACHES?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.661
NO.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.663
- TROUBLE SLEEPING?
- NO.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.499
ANY FEELINGS
OF LETHARGY?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.834
- NO.
- LACK OF APPETITE?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.504
DIFFICULTY BECOMING
SEXUALLY AROUSED,

02:16.504 --> 02:18.005
MAINTAINING
AN ERECTION?

02:18.005 --> 02:20.140
PROBLEMS WITH
PREMATURE EJACULATION?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.875
NO.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.878
WHAT ABOUT THOUGHTS OF
A SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL
NATURE?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.580
NO.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.419
YOU NEVER FANTASIZE ABOUT
HURTING ANYBODY--

02:31.419 --> 02:33.754
YOURSELF OR OTHERS?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.625
WELL...

02:37.625 --> 02:39.793
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
I GUESS.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.663
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WOULD NEVER ACT ON IT.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.098
I UNDERSTAND.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.504
AND YOU'RE IN
GOOD HEALTH, SO...

02:53.974 --> 02:55.476
THERE YOU GO.

02:58.812 --> 03:02.383
- I'M IN?
- TAKE ONE PILL A DAY,
PREFERABLY WITH FOOD.

03:02.383 --> 03:06.887
BUT WAIT, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR
MY BLOOD-TEST RESULTS?

03:06.887 --> 03:08.389
NO, WE'RE GOOD.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.792
I JUST NEED YOUR
JOHN HANCOCK RIGHT THERE.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.528
AND THESE-- THESE--
THESE REALLY WORK?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.831
OUR RESULTS HAVE BEEN
REMARKABLY PROMISING.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.338
OKAY.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.875
AND THERE.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.643
AND ALSO THERE.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.115
WELCOME TO
OUR STUDY...

03:35.115 --> 03:36.950
LES.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.152
AND THANK YOU.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.155
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST
PARTICIPATING IN
A CLINICAL TRIAL,

03:42.155 --> 03:44.325
YOU'RE HELPING DEVELOP
A MEDICATION

03:44.325 --> 03:46.427
THAT WILL BENEFIT
A GREAT MANY PEOPLE.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.362
SO YOU JUST POP IN
HERE ONE TIME A WEEK

03:48.362 --> 03:50.197
SO WE CAN MONITOR
YOUR PROGRESS.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.868
AND HERE'S A FREE
T-SHIRT FOR YOU.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.806
CAN I TAKE
THE FIRST ONE NOW?

03:58.806 --> 03:59.840
MMM.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.248
AND HOW LONG TILL
I START FEELING...

04:08.248 --> 04:10.351
YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT?

04:21.161 --> 04:23.597
( distant siren wails )

04:27.535 --> 04:30.203
Les's voice:
I'VE DECIDED TO START
THIS MEDICATION JOURNAL

04:30.203 --> 04:33.040
SO I DON'T FORGET ANYTHING
NOTEWORTHY BETWEEN VISITS.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.377
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I JOINED
THE STUDY ON A WHIM.

04:36.377 --> 04:40.381
YOU SEE, I'M REALLY
PRETTY HAPPY WITH MY LIFE.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.883
WELL, MAYBE "HAPPY"
ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD,

04:42.883 --> 04:44.885
BUT I'M NOT UNHAPPY.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.720
IT'S MORE LIKE

04:46.720 --> 04:49.390
I ONCE READ ABOUT A MONSTER
CALLED THE EXTRICATOR

04:49.390 --> 04:51.559
THAT LIVED OFF
PEOPLE'S SOULS.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.562
ONLY THE THING WAS,
THE EXTRICATOR ATE
A PERSON'S SOUL IN THEIR SLEEP

04:54.562 --> 04:56.397
OVER A 16-YEAR PERIOD.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.532
LIKE IT WOULD NIBBLE
OFF A CRUMB EVERY NIGHT

04:58.532 --> 05:00.534
UNTIL THERE WASN'T
ANYTHING LEFT,

05:00.534 --> 05:03.871
SO A PERSON HAD NO WAY TO
REALIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.039
THEY JUST HAD THIS
VAGUE SENSE

05:06.039 --> 05:08.709
THAT SOMETHING WAS
SLOWLY DISAPPEARING.

05:08.709 --> 05:12.646
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I AM
A LITTLE DEPRESSED LATELY.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.990
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.092
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.894
I AM SO BROKE.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.097
I'M SORRY, MA'AM,
BUT I ALREADY STARTED
WRITING THE CITATION.

05:30.097 --> 05:34.435
UM, LISTEN, YOU COULD
PARK HERE ALL DAY

05:34.435 --> 05:37.438
AND I PROMISE I WON'T--
I WON'T WRITE
ANOTHER TICKET,

05:37.438 --> 05:39.707
BUT ONCE I START
WRITING THE TICKET--

05:42.042 --> 05:44.712
SEE, I GET
REPRIMANDED IF--

05:44.712 --> 05:46.814
PLEASE...

05:54.287 --> 05:57.224
OH, THANK YOU!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

06:00.428 --> 06:02.095
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.364
SOME ASSHOLE WAS TRYING
TO TICKET ME.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.401
( muted rock playing )

06:07.401 --> 06:09.737
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

06:09.737 --> 06:13.240
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY
COMICS YOU FIND IN A DUMPSTER.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.908
END OF STORY.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.244
WHAT DO YOU SAY, CHIEF?
FIVE BUCKS?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.847
WHAT IF SOMEONE
PISSED ON THEM?

06:22.783 --> 06:25.218
I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU
PAY HIM FOR THOSE, I'M--

06:26.353 --> 06:29.189
YOU'RE A GOOD LITTLE MAN.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.358
AND YOU--

06:31.358 --> 06:33.627
YOU'RE A VERY BAD
LITTLE MAN.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.497
LES?

06:36.497 --> 06:39.166
COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO
MY RETARDED SIBLING HERE

06:39.166 --> 06:41.334
THAT I CAN'T KEEP THE STORE
OPEN IF HE INSISTS

06:41.334 --> 06:44.505
ON THROWING OUR MONEY AWAY
ON CRACKHEAD PISS COMICS?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.240
I SHOULD-- I PROBABLY
SHOULD GO BACK TO WORK.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.876
OH, LES, LES?
COME HERE, MAN.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.013
CHECK IT OUT--
I GOT YOU THE NEW
"IRON WOMAN,"

06:53.013 --> 06:55.516
THE NEW "NIGHTMARE KILLER"
AND THE NEW "TIME TRAVEL."

06:55.516 --> 06:58.218
- COOL.
- I'M SO SICK OF PEOPLE
THINKING "TIME TRAVEL"

06:58.218 --> 07:00.721
IS ALL ABOUT SOME DUDE WHO
SHOWS UP FROM NOWHERE

07:00.721 --> 07:04.057
SAYING, "I'VE COME FROM
THE FUTURE THAT WILL
NO LONGER EXIST,"

07:04.057 --> 07:06.226
AND THEN FIXES
YOUR PROBLEMS.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.596
DON'T LET HIM
HARSH YOU, LES.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.764
"TIME TRAVEL"
IS SERIOUSLY DOPE

07:10.764 --> 07:13.534
IN AN OLD-SCHOOL
KIND OF WAY.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.871
YO, IF YOU WANT
TO COME BY LATER,

07:17.871 --> 07:20.373
WE RENTED THIS CRAZY
IRANIAN KNOCKOFF--
"WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK."

07:20.373 --> 07:22.042
YEAH, MAN, COME BY.
CHECK IT OUT.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.678
SAVE ME FROM ANOTHER NIGHT
ALONE WITH CAPTAIN PISS COMIC.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.680
SURE.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.081
YEAH, MAYBE.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.932
Les's voice:
I KNOW I'M TOO OLD TO
LIKE COMICS AS MUCH AS I DO,

07:44.932 --> 07:49.269
BUT IN COMICS, A VILLAIN
CAN LAUNCH A MISSILE
AT A SUPERHERO

07:49.269 --> 07:51.605
AND THE HERO
JUST KEEPS COMING.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.774
AND THEN THE VILLAIN
CAN THROW AN ATOM BOMB

07:53.774 --> 07:56.443
OR AN ASTEROID OR AN ENTIRE
PLANET AT THE HERO,

07:56.443 --> 07:58.612
BUT THAT WON'T
STOP THEM EITHER.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.448
BECAUSE A REAL SUPERHERO
IS LIKE A FORCE OF NATURE.

08:01.448 --> 08:05.619
AND WHEN I READ COMICS,
I GET THIS FAINT GLIMPSE
OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

08:05.619 --> 08:09.289
TO BE NOT JUST
STRONGER, FASTER,

08:09.289 --> 08:11.625
OR SMARTER THAN
ORDINARY PEOPLE,

08:11.625 --> 08:14.628
BUT WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE TO BE,

08:14.628 --> 08:18.231
WELL, TO BE UNSTOPPABLE.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.243
LES, LES, LES, LES.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.681
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS
TO ME, CHAMP?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.015
YEAH, I'M SORRY, STEVE,
I JUST--

08:35.015 --> 08:36.650
I LIKE YOU, KID.
I REALLY DO.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.153
BUT THE MONEY THAT
THOSE PARASITES CON FROM YOU,

08:40.153 --> 08:43.490
IT GOES TO SCHOOLS,
HOSPITALS, SOUP KITCHENS.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.826
SO REALLY WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IS,

08:45.826 --> 08:48.528
YOU'RE HELPING THEM STEAL
FROM TERMINALLY-ILL
HOMELESS CHILDREN.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.530
- NO, I KNOW--
- I KNOW IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.200
BELIEVE ME. EVEN OUR
FELLOW POLICE OFFICERS

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
THINK WE'RE SOME
KIND OF JOKE.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.370
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO
REMIND YOURSELF

08:57.370 --> 09:00.207
THAT WE ARE THE ONES THAT
KEEP THIS CITY RUNNING.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.175
I KNOW.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.177
THEN SAY IT.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.579
PARDON ME?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.782
THE MANTRA EXERCISE.

09:11.218 --> 09:15.222
LOOK, I HAVE SEEN
THIS JOB SNAP A LOT TOUGHER
MEN THAN YOU, CHAMP.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.058
SO UNLESS YOU CHANGE
YOUR ATTITUDE,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.994
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LAST MUCH LONGER AROUND HERE.

09:23.296 --> 09:27.400
I'M IMPORTANT AND
I KEEP THIS CITY RUNNING.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.069
GOOD.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.272
NOW REPEAT.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.846
I'M IMPORTANT.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.682
I'M IMPORTANT.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
I'M IMPORTANT.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.721
Les's voice:
6:48 P.M.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.990
STILL NOT FEELING ANYTHING.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.695
( microwave beeps )

10:53.954 --> 10:56.056
( panting )

12:20.673 --> 12:22.275
LES?

12:25.879 --> 12:27.714
OH, MAN.

12:27.714 --> 12:31.384
I THINK I JUST-- I MIGHT BE
TOO NERVOUS OR SOMETHING.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.320
( sighs )

12:36.089 --> 12:38.191
LES-- LES, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.062
LES, WHY DON'T YOU
COME DOWN FROM THERE

12:42.062 --> 12:44.231
AND WE CAN TALK
A LITTLE BIT MORE?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.733
- ( low rumbling )
- LES?

12:46.733 --> 12:48.501
LES?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.107
NO!

12:55.175 --> 12:56.844
AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

12:56.844 --> 12:59.346
IT'S QUITE UNUSUAL.
ARE YOU HURT?

12:59.346 --> 13:01.348
NO NO, I NEVER FELT BETTER.
WHY?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.850
WELL...

13:02.850 --> 13:05.018
HEY, HAS THIS HAPPENED
TO ANYONE ELSE?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.855
NO, I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING QUITE
LIKE IT BEFORE.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.223
WHAT DO YOU THINK
CAUSED THIS, DR. DOBSON?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.059
WELL, I THINK WE HAVE
TO DISCUSS THAT--

13:12.059 --> 13:14.661
( knocking )

13:14.661 --> 13:17.464
COULD-- COULD YOU
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.232
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

13:19.232 --> 13:22.335
JUST DON'T MOVE.
I-- I'LL BE BACK IN
A MOMENT OR TWO.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.343
- WHAT SEEMS TO BE--
- ( door closes )

13:43.256 --> 13:46.193
SORRY ABOUT THAT, LES.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.528
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.463
PLEASE JUST FOLLOW ME.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.116
Dr. Dobson's thoughts:
CAN YOU HEAR ME, LES?

14:09.116 --> 14:10.951
OF COURSE.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.119
EXCUSE ME?

14:12.119 --> 14:14.287
THIS ROOM
COULD BE BUGGED.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.956
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.290
DO WHAT?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.459
I ASSUME YOU'VE HEARD
OF TELEPATHY.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.961
YOU'RE TELEPATHIC?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.295
WHAT?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.631
I'M NOT TELEPATHIC, LES.
YOU ARE.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.798
I AM?

14:25.798 --> 14:28.001
- YOU ARE WHAT?
- TELEPATHIC.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.713
THE DRUG BESTOWED YOU
WITH MANY POWERS.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.051
YOU'RE HAVING AN ADVERSE
PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION, LES.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.553
YOU'RE READING
MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.522
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU?

14:49.522 --> 14:53.560
WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.563
THE MEDICATION WAS DESIGNED
TO SUPPRESS THE CHEMICALS

14:56.563 --> 14:59.566
IN THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE
FOR SELF-DOUBT.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.236
UNFORTUNATELY, BRAIN CHEMISTRY
CAN BE AS UNIQUE

15:03.236 --> 15:06.406
AND AS UNPREDICTABLE
AS A FINGERPRINT.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.341
OH.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.244
OKAY.

15:14.481 --> 15:18.385
SO THE MEDICATION UNLEASHED
POWERS THAT I ALREADY HAD?

15:18.385 --> 15:21.721
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY POWERS?

15:21.721 --> 15:24.724
NEVER MENTION
YOUR POWERS OUT LOUD.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.093
WHY NOT?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.927
IT ISN'T SAFE.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.531
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU CEASE
THE MEDICATION IMMEDIATELY.

15:31.531 --> 15:35.235
LUCKILY, IT HAS A HALF-LIFE
THAT'S EXTREMELY SHORT
IN THE BLOODSTREAM.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.904
SO WHATEVER YOU'RE
EXPERIENCING SHOULD DISAPPEAR

15:37.904 --> 15:40.140
SOON AFTER YOU'VE INGESTED
YOUR LAST DOSE.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.248
Les's thoughts:
CAN YOU HEAR ME, DR. DOBSON?

15:48.248 --> 15:51.251
VERY GOOD, LES.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.886
YOU'RE LEARNING TO CONTROL
YOUR POWERS FASTER

15:53.886 --> 15:55.989
THAN I WOULD HAVE
DREAMED POSSIBLE.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.227
- LES?
- JUST A SECOND.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.099
SHOULD I REALLY STOP
TAKING THE MEDICATION?

16:06.099 --> 16:09.436
HEAVENS NO.  I JUST SAID THAT
BECAUSE THEY'RE LISTENING.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.105
KEEP TAKING ONE PILL A DAY.
BY THE END OF THE CYCLE,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.374
YOUR POWERS
WILL BE PERMANENT.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
WHAT ARE YOU
STARING AT, LES?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.981
SORRY.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
UM...

16:23.983 --> 16:26.319
OKAY.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.821
SO I'LL JUST, UM...

16:28.821 --> 16:33.326
I'LL JUST FLUSH THE REST
OF THE PILLS AS--

16:33.326 --> 16:34.827
AS SOON AS I GET HOME.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.330
GOOD.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.832
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW

16:39.832 --> 16:43.336
IS TO GO HOME,
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

16:43.336 --> 16:45.605
GET THIS ALL BEHIND YOU.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.442
OKAY, I WILL.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.282
( lights buzzing )

16:55.282 --> 16:57.950
I'M ALSO OBLIGED
TO REMIND YOU

16:57.950 --> 17:02.122
HOW SERIOUSLY
THIS COMPANY TAKES THE--

17:02.122 --> 17:05.125
THE NONDISCLOSURE SECTION
OF THE CONTRACT YOU SIGNED.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.959
I UNDERSTAND, DR. DOBSON.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.296
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.132
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
OR CONCERNS,

17:12.132 --> 17:16.303
ANYTHING AT ALL, THIS IS
MY PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.205
- UH-HUH.
- I WANT YOU TO CALL ME,
ANYTIME.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.840
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.776
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.446
TAKE CARE, LES.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.224
Woman's thoughts:
HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY ASKED,

17:37.224 --> 17:41.228
BUT NO, EVERYTHING HAS
TO BE A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
GAME WITH HIM.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.664
THEY SHOULD REALLY GET
BETTER SECURITY IN THIS PLACE.

17:47.033 --> 17:50.970
I'M FAT, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I'M LIKE A DUMP TRUCK.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.414
Woman's thoughts:
IT'S LIKE THERE ARE TWO KINDS
OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD--

18:01.414 --> 18:04.751
ONES WHO FEEL BAD WHEN
ROCK STARS KILL THEMSELVES,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.120
AND THE ONES
WHO THINK IT'S FUNNY.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.795
( voices overlapping )

18:24.604 --> 18:26.806
LIKE A SWEET, JUICY PEACH.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.945
PEACH COBBLER--
I COULD GO FOR SOME
PEACH COBBLER.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.616
I MISS THELMA.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.653
( all thinking
in Japanese )

18:46.393 --> 18:48.328
( voices fading )

19:18.191 --> 19:20.393
Man's thoughts:
CONDOMS?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.229
I DON'T SEE HER FOR
TWO MONTHS

19:22.229 --> 19:24.397
AND WHEN I FINALLY DO,
SHE'S BUYING CONDOMS?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.165
WITH CHUCK.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.336
OH, I HAVE TO SNEAK OUT
BEFORE THEY NOTICE ME.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.671
OH.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.307
WHAT IF SHE SPOTS ME
TRYING TO RUN AWAY?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.948
DON'T BE A SUCKER.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.151
DON'T BE A LITTLE PUNK.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.122
JUST GO OVER THERE AND
SHOVE THE BARREL IN HER FACE.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.392
SHE'LL GIVE OVER
THE CASH.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.953
( both grunt )

20:53.420 --> 20:55.755
CAN'T YOU READ, BITCH?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.089
OH, SHIT.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.258
SORRY, LES MAN.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A CUSTOMER.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.593
HEY, CAN I COME IN?

21:00.593 --> 21:03.195
YEAH, MI CASA ES
YOUR CASA, BRO.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.069
LES MAN, YOU WON'T
BELIEVE SOME OF THESE
CUSTOMERS TODAY, DUDE.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.942
THEY GO TOTALLY
BALLISTIC IF THEY
CAN'T GET THEIR MANGA

21:15.942 --> 21:17.944
EXACTLY WHEN THEY
WANT IT, RIGHT?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.112
JUST KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKING
ALL DAY LONG.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.614
IS EVERETT HERE?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.783
'CAUSE I NEED TO
SHOW YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.553
YEAH, DUDE, JUST
GO ON BACK AND TAKE
A MENTAL-HEALTH DAY.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.859
( beads rattle )

21:34.327 --> 21:36.663
LES, MY FRIEND.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.599
HEY, EXPLAIN TO
MY RETARDED SIBLING HERE--

21:39.599 --> 21:42.034
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING
HAS A FORCE FIELD, RIGHT?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.703
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT
HAS TO BE INVISIBLE.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.539
DON'T EVEN GET INTO IT
WITH HIM, LES, ALL RIGHT?

21:46.539 --> 21:49.909
HE'S BEEN IN
EXTRA-CRANKY MODE ALL DAY.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.911
LISTEN, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.480
WHAT IS IT, LES?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.748
FIRST YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.650
TELL ANYONE WHAT?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.352
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'RE
NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.621
WHAT ARE WE, THE FUCKING
BOY SCOUTS ALL OF A SUDDEN?

22:01.621 --> 22:03.255
I'M SERIOUS.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.991
I PROMISE, LES.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.329
YOU SATISFIED, OR DO WE
NEED TO PINKIE SWEAR TOO?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.665
OKAY.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.601
THE THING IS...

22:18.405 --> 22:20.840
I HAVE SUPER-POWERS.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.975
( both laugh )

22:22.975 --> 22:25.478
YOU GUYS,
I'M SERIOUS.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.980
OH, YOU--
YOU GOT ME, LES.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.582
THAT WAS PRICELESS.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.427
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT PIZZA.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.266
AND YOU'RE THINKING
I'M FULL OF CRAP.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.602
BUT NOW YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT PIZZA TOO--

22:49.602 --> 22:52.304
NO CHEESE, EXTRA OLIVES.

22:52.304 --> 22:57.209
THAT IS SOME SERIOUS
DAVID BLAINE TRICKERY,
MY FRIEND.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.211
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S NO TRICK.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.881
AND NOT ONLY
DO I HAVE POWERS,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.050
BUT THEY'RE DEVELOPING
LIKE GANGBUSTERS.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.486
EVEN ON THE WAY OVER HERE,
I DISCOVERED A NEW ONE.

23:06.486 --> 23:10.423
WHAT WAS THIS NEW POWER,
O PUISSANT ONE?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.492
YOU REALLY WANT
TO SEE IT?

23:12.492 --> 23:14.627
YEAH.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.405
( both laugh )

23:26.405 --> 23:28.808
GOD DAMN, LES.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.143
THAT WAS PUNK ROCK,
BRO.

23:32.311 --> 23:35.114
AND THAT'S JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.785
THE MORE DIFFICULT POWERS--

23:38.785 --> 23:43.490
IT SEEMS TO EXACT A SLIGHT
PHYSICAL TOLL.

23:47.494 --> 23:51.598
SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING
WITH THESE AWESOME POWERS?

23:51.598 --> 23:54.801
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU GUYS ABOUT, SEE?

23:54.801 --> 23:58.304
Les on phone:
I understand the need
to keep our secret,

23:58.304 --> 24:02.642
but stopping that
robbery today was the first
time in my whole life

24:02.642 --> 24:04.477
that I've ever felt like...

24:04.477 --> 24:07.313
I COULD REALLY MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD,

24:07.313 --> 24:09.649
LIKE I COULD DO SOMETHING
THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN DO--

24:09.649 --> 24:11.484
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

24:11.484 --> 24:13.686
MAYBE EVEN NECESSARY.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.891
SO I TALKED ABOUT IT
WITH MY FRIENDS

24:18.891 --> 24:21.227
AND THEY AGREE THAT IF
A PERSON DOESN'T DO GOOD

24:21.227 --> 24:23.730
WITH THE GIFTS THEY'RE GIVEN,
WELL, THAT'S ALMOST WORSE

24:23.730 --> 24:25.998
THAN DOING EVIL,
ISN'T IT?

24:27.767 --> 24:30.937
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, LES.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.773
BUT IF YOU LEAVE HERE WITHOUT
GIVING ME A MONTH'S NOTICE,

24:33.773 --> 24:36.843
YOU CAN KISS MY LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION GOODBYE.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.444
I UNDERSTAND.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.949
DID ONE OF THOSE
LOWLIFES MAKE YOU
FEEL GUILTY AGAIN?

24:42.949 --> 24:45.284
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?
BECAUSE IF IT IS--

24:45.284 --> 24:48.420
I'M SORRY, STEVE,
BUT I'VE TOLD YOU
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.356
EXCUSE ME.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.825
Les's voice:
THE COSTUME IS
OBVIOUSLY INTEGRAL

25:25.825 --> 25:27.493
FOR ANY SUPERHERO.

25:27.493 --> 25:30.597
IT CAN PROTECT
THE HERO'S TRUE IDENTITY,

25:30.597 --> 25:32.298
IT CAN INSPIRE FEAR,

25:32.298 --> 25:35.201
CURIOSITY OR AMAZEMENT.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.536
BUT IN MY OPINION,

25:37.536 --> 25:40.306
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF A COSTUME

25:40.306 --> 25:42.308
IS WHAT GOES
ON THE BACK OF IT.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.310
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST
THE HERO'S NAME,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.312
IT'S THEIR MESSAGE
TO THE PUBLIC.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.480
I WANT MY COSTUME
TO TELL PEOPLE

25:48.480 --> 25:51.984
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T
GIVE UP NO MATTER HOW
ALONE THEY SOMETIMES FEEL.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.286
BECAUSE ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.793
IT TURNS OUT THAT
BEING A SUPERHERO

27:06.793 --> 27:09.295
WAS LIKE MANY OTHER
THINGS IN LIFE:

27:09.295 --> 27:11.463
WHEN YOU WANT TO AVOID IT,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.800
CRIME SEEMS LIKE
IT'S EVERYWHERE,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.601
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IT,

27:15.601 --> 27:17.870
CRIME IS NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.

27:22.742 --> 27:26.512
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
TO LEARN TO ALWAYS TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.386
WHOA, CANDY,
THAT HAD TO HURT.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.055
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN,
CHUCK.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.390
NOW LET'S TAKE
ONE MORE LOOK AT IT.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.740
If you have any information
about this bizarre local case,

28:27.740 --> 28:31.410
that number again
is 1-800-555-8477.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.981
1-800-555-TIPS.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.483
Our mad tackler
is Caucasian,

28:37.483 --> 28:39.485
approximately
six feet tall,

28:39.485 --> 28:41.653
and is wearing
a white leather suit

28:41.653 --> 28:44.256
with an unexplained symbol
on the back.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.730
I THINK WE HAVE
A PROBLEM.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.336
Les's voice:
BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED,

28:57.336 --> 28:59.505
I ASSUMED A SUPERHERO
WOULD BE FREE

28:59.505 --> 29:01.841
FROM EVERYDAY FEAR
AND INSECURITY.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.844
BUT I'M DISCOVERING THAT
WHEN THE COSTUME COMES OFF,

29:04.844 --> 29:07.213
SOME OF THE MOST SIMPLE
THINGS IN LIFE

29:07.213 --> 29:09.148
STILL FEEL
THE MOST DANGEROUS.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.220
( footsteps approach )

29:14.220 --> 29:16.288
HEY.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.961
SO THAT WAS PRETTY CRAZY
THE OTHER DAY, HUH?

29:23.896 --> 29:26.899
WITH THE GUY AND
THE GUN AND EVERYTHING.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.507
BUT MAYBE THAT KIND
OF THING HAPPENS A LOT
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.351
WELL, I GUESS I'LL--
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.456
I'M SORRY.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.993
DO YOU KNOW,
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS--

29:56.095 --> 29:58.197
I WANTED TO ASK YOU--

30:00.332 --> 30:02.835
I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU--

30:02.835 --> 30:06.605
YOU WANTED TO HAVE--

30:08.975 --> 30:12.544
YOU CAN...
KEEP THE CHANGE.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.508
Les's voice:
I SUPPOSE THE MAIN POINT
TO GET ACROSS HERE

30:42.508 --> 30:44.510
IS THAT EVEN WITH
GOOD INSTINCTS,

30:44.510 --> 30:48.014
THE LIFE OF
A CRIME FIGHTER TAKES
A SMALL ADJUSTMENT PERIOD.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.182
AND EVEN THEN IT'S DIFFICULT
TO UNDERSTAND

30:50.182 --> 30:52.451
EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING ON SOMETIMES.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.306
( tires screech )

31:18.877 --> 31:20.712
THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO PURSUE

31:20.712 --> 31:22.814
A MORE CONVENTIONAL
WORK ENVIRONMENT.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.029
EXCUSE ME, OFFICER?

31:37.029 --> 31:39.865
I CAN'T TELL YOU
MY REAL NAME,

31:39.865 --> 31:43.202
- BUT I USED TO WORK HERE.
- YOU'RE A COP?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.703
PARDON ME?

31:44.703 --> 31:47.906
NO, UM, PARKING ENFORCEMENT.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.009
BUT, UH...

31:50.009 --> 31:52.344
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.781
ANYWAY, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SEE.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.921
PRETTY SOLID WALL, HUH?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.256
YEAH.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.592
OR IT SEEMS THAT WAY
TO MOST PEOPLE,

32:06.592 --> 32:08.694
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

32:14.333 --> 32:15.901
JESUS, MARY, JOSEPH.

32:25.511 --> 32:29.181
I'M NOT LIKE MOST PEOPLE.

32:29.181 --> 32:32.318
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
- WHO CAN I TALK TO?

32:32.318 --> 32:33.785
TALK TO?

32:33.785 --> 32:36.288
ABOUT HELPING OUT,

32:36.288 --> 32:38.624
PUTTING THIS STUFF TO WORK.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.326
YOU KNOW?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.094
FIGHTING CRIMES.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.763
I'VE HAD SOME LUCK
RECENTLY,

32:44.763 --> 32:46.532
MOSTLY SMALL STUFF--

32:46.532 --> 32:51.103
SHOPLIFTING,
ARMED ROBBERY.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.805
YOU'RE AN ARMED ROBBER?

32:53.805 --> 32:57.143
NO, I STOP CRIMES,
OFFICER.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.311
CONVENIENCE-STORE
STUFF MOSTLY.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.747
BUT I THINK I'M READY
TO MOVE UP.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.850
YOU KNOW,
I'VE HEARD OF YOU.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.954
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD...

33:08.954 --> 33:11.457
DEVELOP SOME SORT
OF SIGNAL.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.459
YOU KNOW?

33:13.459 --> 33:15.794
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
AS COMPLICATED AS
THE BAT SIGNAL.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.297
IN THE MEANTIME,

33:18.297 --> 33:21.400
HERE'S MY CARD.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.169
TAKE ONE OF THOSE.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.605
PAGER NUMBER ON IT.
YOU--

33:26.605 --> 33:28.940
YOU GIVE ME A CALL
ANYTIME YOU NEED SOMETHING

33:28.940 --> 33:31.277
AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.979
ACTUALLY, I THINK I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.215
REALLY?

33:36.215 --> 33:40.219
THERE'S THIS LOON GOING AROUND
TACKLING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.820
RIGHT?

33:56.902 --> 33:59.004
Man:
GET IN, LES.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.188
CRAZY METERMAIDS.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.125
THAT WAS EXCITING.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.463
YOU HAVE A GENUINE FLAIR
FOR MAKING A SCENE,
DON'T YOU, LES?

34:24.463 --> 34:27.533
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TO
GET ON TELEVISION AGAIN,

34:27.533 --> 34:30.436
MAYBE SOMETHING NATIONAL
THIS TIME.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.036
WHO ARE YOU?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.643
MY NAME IS JONAS EXILER.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.811
AND THIS IS MY BROTHER
THEODORE.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.149
MAYBE YOU KNOW US
AS THE...

34:43.149 --> 34:46.585
PEOPLE WHOSE DREAMS
YOU'RE TRYING TO FLUSH
DOWN THE TOILET.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.089
WE'VE SPENT THE LAST
FIVE YEARS OF OUR LIVES

34:51.089 --> 34:53.259
AND EVERY PENNY
WE'VE EVER SAVED

34:53.259 --> 34:56.828
TRYING TO GET THIS COMPANY
OFF THE GROUND, LES.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.697
IT'S BEEN AN UPHILL BATTLE,

34:58.697 --> 35:01.300
BELIEVE ME.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.137
YOU'RE TELEPATHIC TOO?

35:09.875 --> 35:12.311
YOU'RE A DEEPLY TROUBLED
INDIVIDUAL, AREN'T YOU, BUDDY?

35:12.311 --> 35:16.782
WE WANT TO HELP YOU, LES.
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

35:16.782 --> 35:19.117
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT
THE REACTION THAT YOU'RE HAVING

35:19.117 --> 35:20.786
IS A COMPLETE ANOMALY.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.789
AND REALLY, THERE'S NO PROOF
THE SPECIAL IS RESPONSIBLE

35:23.789 --> 35:25.791
FOR ANYTHING
YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.294
YOU COULD JUST BE EXPERIENCING
SOME SORT OF UNRELATED...

35:28.294 --> 35:29.961
( voice fades out )

35:29.961 --> 35:31.630
WHAT?

35:35.301 --> 35:36.968
FUCKING HELL.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.805
I-- I CAN'T DO THAT.

35:39.805 --> 35:43.809
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING WE'RE TRYING
TO TELL YOU, LES?

35:43.809 --> 35:46.845
- I WILL NEVER JOIN YOU.
- THE MEDICATION
IS MAKING YOU SICK.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.514
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

35:48.514 --> 35:51.683
IS STOP TAKING
THE MEDICATION.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.353
AND STOP RUNNING AROUND
IN THAT SILLY SUIT.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.522
- THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING HERE.
- NEVER.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.191
WE COULD SUE YOU
TO HELL AND BACK FOR
RUNNING AROUND ON TV

35:59.191 --> 36:01.360
WEARING OUR LOGO.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

36:01.360 --> 36:04.129
BUT WE'D JUST AS SOON
AVOID ANY NEGATIVE
PUBLICITY RIGHT NOW.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.233
JUST STOP TAKING THE PILLS.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.602
WE CAN PUT ALL THIS
BEHIND US.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.747
WELL, THEN WE HAVE
A PROBLEM...

36:23.582 --> 36:26.452
- DON'T WE?
- ( faint beeping )

36:26.452 --> 36:28.787
- BECAUSE THE WAY I SEE IT--
- WHO ARE YOU?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.989
I COME FROM THE FUTURE

36:30.989 --> 36:32.991
THAT WILL NO LONGER EXIST.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.660
WHO IS HE TALKING TO NOW?

36:34.660 --> 36:37.496
THESE ARE THE MEN
THAT CONVINCED THE POLICE

36:37.496 --> 36:40.732
- THAT YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG.
- OF COURSE.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.901
LES?

36:42.901 --> 36:46.204
EARTH TO LES.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.541
THEY DESIGNED THE DRUG
TO BUILD AN ARMY OF
UNSTOPPABLE ASSASSINS.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.443
AND IF YOU WON'T WORK
FOR THEM,

36:51.443 --> 36:53.412
THEY'LL TRY TO
STRIP YOU OF YOUR POWERS.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.518
- OR WORSE.
- WORSE?

36:59.518 --> 37:02.288
- MUCH WORSE.
- I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.889
BUT DON'T WORRY...

37:03.889 --> 37:06.692
BECAUSE I WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.694
- LET'S JUST TAKE
HIM TO THE E.R.
- THE E.R.?

37:08.694 --> 37:13.131
- ARE YOU CRAZY--
- NO!

37:14.500 --> 37:17.068
OW.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.143
( tires screech )

37:30.882 --> 37:33.051
DON'T JUST STARE AT HIM.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.453
GET HIM.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.796
AHHH!

38:22.167 --> 38:23.935
( force field vibrating )

38:26.538 --> 38:29.808
Theodore's thoughts:
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY
INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD?

38:33.044 --> 38:34.646
( grunts )

38:40.285 --> 38:43.288
NOT MUCH OXYGEN INSIDE,
IS THERE?

38:43.288 --> 38:45.056
AHH!

38:45.056 --> 38:48.326
YOU SHOULD HAVE JOINED US
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.620
YOUR FORCE FIELD IS GOOD,

39:14.620 --> 39:18.223
BUT MY TELEPORTING
IS BETTER.

39:23.462 --> 39:26.398
( psychedelic rock
playing )

39:36.742 --> 39:38.410
- ( electric buzzing )
- YES!

39:38.410 --> 39:41.079
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YEAH, YOU LOVE THAT SHIT.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.914
WHOO!
HA HA!

39:42.914 --> 39:44.583
- OH, SHIT.
- FUCKING GAME.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.585
THIS IS THE BEST GAME
EVER INVENT--

39:46.585 --> 39:48.353
LES! LES,
MAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:48.353 --> 39:51.490
YEAH, MAN, ANTOINE SAID
HE SAW YOU ON THE IDIOT BOX
OR SOMETHING.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.191
- BAD OUTFIT, BY THE WAY.
- OH, YEAH.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.193
DO YOU--
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

39:55.193 --> 39:57.028
YEAH, HE COMES IN HERE
SOMETIMES.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.030
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

39:59.030 --> 40:01.032
YEAH, I'M GOOD.
LISTEN, WE HAVE TO TALK.

40:01.032 --> 40:04.202
- WHAT'S UP?
- AFTER I STARTED USING
MY POWERS TO HELP PEOPLE,

40:04.202 --> 40:06.204
THESE TWO BROTHERS
IN SUITS SHOWED UP.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.040
AND SINCE I WOULDN'T JOIN THEM,
THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY ME.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.876
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.545
AND I THINK THEY MIGHT
HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER
THE NEWS MEDIA

40:13.545 --> 40:15.547
AND MAYBE
EVEN THE POLICE.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.716
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I
CAME BACK FROM THE FUTURE,

40:17.716 --> 40:21.820
THEY MANAGED TO
FRAME ME FOR CRIMES
THAT I DIDN'T COMMIT.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.091
YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

40:26.091 --> 40:28.494
OF COURSE.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.531
UH-- UH, I'M SORRY.

40:32.531 --> 40:36.034
UM, I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY,
BUT WE'RE CLOSING UP
EARLY TODAY.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.936
YOU GOTTA GO.
I'M SORRY.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.507
BUT I WANT TO BUY THIS.

40:41.507 --> 40:44.510
FLAMETHROWER DEFEATS
THE EYE IN A PROLONGED
AND BLOODY BATTLE

40:44.510 --> 40:46.678
WHEREIN WE LEARN THAT
THE WOOLIAN'S DEATH

40:46.678 --> 40:48.680
WAS A COMPLEX MOROVIAN
SUBTERFUGE, OKAY, BUDDY?

40:48.680 --> 40:52.083
- GET THE FUCK OUT.
- SORRY, MAN.
COME BACK TOMORROW.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.752
- LISTEN, LES...
- LES?

40:53.752 --> 40:56.755
HEY, NO NO NO.
YOU COULD SHUT THOSE, EVERETT.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.524
SHUT THAT.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.896
- YEAH.
- LES? LES, LES,

41:04.896 --> 41:07.065
- THE THING IS, MAN--
- YOU DON'T HAVE SUPER-POWERS.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.635
NO NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:09.635 --> 41:12.337
WE JUST THOUGHT YOU
WERE SCREWING AROUND WITH US,
YOU KNOW?

41:12.337 --> 41:14.640
BUT YOU SAW THE THING
WITH THE WALL-- YOU SAW THAT.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.374
- YOU MEAN YOU RUNNING INTO IT?
- YOU MEAN THROUGH IT.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.510
- I MEAN INTO IT.
- YOU MEAN THROUGH IT!

41:18.510 --> 41:21.813
LES, WE WERE JUST
REALLY HIGH.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.815
JESUS, LES,

41:23.815 --> 41:25.917
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, MAN?

41:35.026 --> 41:38.363
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
OKAY, YOU GOT ME.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.866
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
FOR FOOLING AROUND.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.168
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
ABOUT THE SUITS.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.003
THERE ARE NO SUITS, LES.
THERE'S NO SUITS,

41:45.003 --> 41:47.005
- THERE'S NO SUPER-POWERS--
- AND LES,

41:47.005 --> 41:49.040
LES, YOU KNOW YOU'RE OUR BRO
NO MATTER WHAT, MAN, BUT--

41:49.040 --> 41:51.677
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND, MAN.
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR FUCKING MIND.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.679
REALLY?
IF I DON'T HAVE POWERS,

41:53.679 --> 41:56.114
THEN HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THIS?

41:57.583 --> 41:58.917
EXPLAIN WHAT?

41:58.917 --> 42:00.919
THIS.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.656
YOU CAN'T SEE THIS, JOEY?

42:04.656 --> 42:06.692
YOU'RE JUST REACHING
YOUR ARMS OUT.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.259
YOU HONESTLY
CAN'T SEE THIS?

42:10.095 --> 42:11.763
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO SEE--

42:11.763 --> 42:13.264
- JOEY!
- LES,

42:13.264 --> 42:15.601
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO SEE.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.969
EVERETT?

42:17.969 --> 42:20.371
LES, MAN,
I CAN DO IT TOO.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.677
OKAY.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.892
THEY MUST HAVE--

42:40.892 --> 42:42.728
THEY MUST HAVE
ALREADY GOT TO YOU.

42:42.728 --> 42:45.096
WHO GOT TO US, LES?

42:45.096 --> 42:46.598
THE SUITS!

42:46.598 --> 42:49.601
THE SUITS-- THEY KNOW
THAT YOU'RE MY FRIENDS,

42:49.601 --> 42:52.938
SO THEY MUST HAVE PUT YOU
IN SOME SORT OF MIND SHIELD

42:52.938 --> 42:55.607
SO THAT YOU CAN'T
SEE MY POWERS.

42:55.607 --> 42:58.744
MMM.
IT'S GENIUS.

42:58.744 --> 43:01.179
NO NO NO, LES, LES,
IT'S TOTALLY--

43:01.179 --> 43:03.514
CRAZY! CRAZY, RIGHT?

43:03.514 --> 43:06.718
THEY WANT ME TO THINK
THAT I'M GOING CRAZY.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.519
LES--

43:08.519 --> 43:10.021
THAT'S HOW THEY
LIKE IT.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.523
LES, LES...

43:12.523 --> 43:15.694
I THINK WE MIGHT NEED TO
GET YOU SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.864
IS THERE A DOCTOR OR SOMEONE
WE COULD TAKE YOU TO?

43:23.168 --> 43:24.770
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.997
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S TAKING--

43:51.997 --> 43:53.999
TAKING US TO
A REAL DOCTOR...

43:53.999 --> 43:56.101
OR JUST AN IMAGINARY ONE?

43:59.938 --> 44:01.606
DON'T WORRY.

44:01.606 --> 44:04.042
DR. DOBSON WILL
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

44:08.013 --> 44:10.515
- STOP THE CAR!
- ( slams on brakes )

44:11.582 --> 44:14.853
- WHAT THE HELL?
- WHERE'D HE GO?

44:16.421 --> 44:18.857
THERE HE IS.

44:19.925 --> 44:21.592
LES!

44:21.592 --> 44:23.762
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
GET DOWN FROM THERE.

44:23.762 --> 44:26.631
SOMEBODY STOLE MY PURSE!
HE STOLE MY PURSE.

44:26.631 --> 44:28.466
- DON'T WORRY, MA'AM.
- NO!

44:34.940 --> 44:36.407
I'VE GOT IT.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.509
THANK YOU.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.780
MA'AM,
IN THE FUTURE,

44:41.780 --> 44:44.115
PLEASE BE CAREFUL
WALKING AROUND
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

44:44.115 --> 44:45.951
AFTER DARK.

44:45.951 --> 44:47.385
I WILL.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.161
IT'S LIKE A MOVE
STRAIGHT OUT OF "URBAN WAR."

44:56.161 --> 44:57.662
YOU JUST-- BOOYAH!

44:57.662 --> 44:59.330
QUIT ENCOURAGING HIM.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.833
YOU COULD HAVE SERIOUSLY
MESSED YOURSELF UP, DUDE.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.669
WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE THAT
I HAVE SPECIAL POWERS?

45:04.669 --> 45:07.672
SPECIAL POWERS?
ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOURSELF?

45:07.672 --> 45:09.674
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
SPECIAL POWERS.

45:09.674 --> 45:11.676
- I BELIEVE YOU, LES.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

45:11.676 --> 45:14.012
YES, I DO.
HOW ELSE COULD HE HAVE
DONE WHAT HE DID?

45:14.012 --> 45:15.847
- IT WAS AWESOME.
- IT WAS STUPID.

45:15.847 --> 45:18.183
YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE
A MIRACLE IF IT BIT YOU
IN YOUR ASS.

45:18.183 --> 45:20.018
- A MIRACLE?
- YES, A MIRACLE.

45:20.018 --> 45:22.687
MIRACLES DON'T EXIST,
JOEY.

45:22.687 --> 45:26.691
YOU HAVE BECOME
SUCH A DOWNER LATELY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

45:26.691 --> 45:28.693
LOOK, LES,

45:28.693 --> 45:32.363
YOU'RE PART OF A VERY SMALL
GROUP OF PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH

45:32.363 --> 45:34.365
I ACTUALLY GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT, OKAY?

45:34.365 --> 45:36.534
NOT BECAUSE YOU GOT
SPECIAL POWERS,

45:36.534 --> 45:39.037
BUT BECAUSE-- WELL,
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU.

45:39.037 --> 45:42.040
SO I JUST CAN'T FUCKING
HANDLE YOU TRYING TO KILL
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.508
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

45:43.508 --> 45:45.844
YES, I CAN, EVERETT.

45:45.844 --> 45:48.513
YOU CAN DOUBT MY POWERS
ALL YOU WANT,

45:48.513 --> 45:51.449
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.195
DR. DOBSON?

46:05.296 --> 46:06.798
CAN I HELP YOU?

46:06.798 --> 46:09.801
IT'S OKAY.
WE CAN TRUST THEM.

46:09.801 --> 46:12.670
IS THIS MAN
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

46:14.339 --> 46:16.574
YOU'RE NOT HIS DOCTOR?

46:16.574 --> 46:18.576
FOR SOME
INEXPLICABLE REASON,

46:18.576 --> 46:20.578
HE SEEMS TO BE
UNDER THAT IMPRESSION.

46:20.578 --> 46:23.348
HE CAME AROUND THE OTHER DAY
CLAIMING TO BE PART

46:23.348 --> 46:25.083
OF A MEDICAL STUDY
WE'RE CONDUCTING.

46:25.083 --> 46:27.418
NO NO, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ALL THIS SECRECY.

46:27.418 --> 46:29.587
OKAY? THE SUITS, THEY ALREADY
KNOW ABOUT MY POWERS

46:29.587 --> 46:31.789
AND THEY SOMEHOW--
THEY BRAINWASHED MY FRIENDS.

46:33.691 --> 46:37.128
OKAY? YOU HAVE TO
TELL THEM EVERYTHING.

46:37.128 --> 46:40.131
I'M SORRY, YOUNG MAN,
BUT IF YOU COME
AROUND HERE AGAIN,

46:40.131 --> 46:41.967
I'LL BE FORCED
TO CALL SECURITY.

46:41.967 --> 46:43.969
THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY, SIR.

46:43.969 --> 46:45.636
NO, IT'S OKAY.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.305
WE HAVE TO GO.

46:47.305 --> 46:50.141
NO! YOU HAVE TO WARN THEM.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM--

46:50.141 --> 46:52.477
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
ABOUT THE SUITS.

46:52.477 --> 46:56.147
OKAY? THEY'RE AFTER ME.
THEY COULD BE AFTER ALL OF US.
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

46:56.147 --> 46:59.284
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
YOUNG MAN.

46:59.284 --> 47:01.619
- THE SUITS!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE SUITS, LES.

47:01.619 --> 47:03.788
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
LET'S GO.
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

47:03.788 --> 47:06.457
OKAY, THEY'RE VERY--
THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL.

47:06.457 --> 47:08.626
THEY'RE VERY--
THEY'RE SCARY PEOPLE.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.795
THAT'S WHY HE'S
PACKING UP.

47:10.795 --> 47:13.631
OKAY? THAT'S WHY
HE'S SCARED, BECAUSE--

47:13.631 --> 47:15.666
SEE, HE'S RUNNING AWAY,
YOU SEE?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.835
HE'S RUNNING AWAY.

47:17.835 --> 47:21.372
I SUSPECT YOUR FRIEND
HAS INGESTED SOME RELATIVELY
HARMLESS NARCOTIC.

47:21.372 --> 47:25.376
HAVE HIM DRINK THIS.
IT'LL HELP CLEAN ANY RESIDUAL
CHEMICALS IN HIS SYSTEM

47:25.376 --> 47:27.212
BEFORE IT'S ABSORBED
IN HIS BLOODSTREAM.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.380
WAIT ABOUT SIX HOURS OR SO.
IF HE DOESN'T SEEM ANY BETTER,

47:29.380 --> 47:31.449
TAKE HIM TO
THE EMERGENCY ROOM. OKAY?

47:31.449 --> 47:32.951
OKAY.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.920
- AHH!
- NO NO NO NO NO.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.455
HEE! HUH?

47:37.455 --> 47:39.457
WHAT IS THIS?

47:39.457 --> 47:41.626
THE ANTIDOTE?

47:41.626 --> 47:44.462
THIS IS THE ANTIDOTE,
ISN'T IT?

47:44.462 --> 47:47.298
DRINKING THIS WILL
TAKE AWAY MY POWERS?

47:47.298 --> 47:50.468
NO NO, IT'S GONNA
STRENGTHEN YOUR POWERS, LES.

47:50.468 --> 47:53.138
LES, IF YOU DRINK THAT,
MAN, IT'S GONNA STRENGTHEN
YOUR POWERS.

47:53.138 --> 47:55.974
YEAH YEAH YEAH.
LES LES, PLEASE. PLEASE.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.309
- JUST TAKE IT.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

47:58.309 --> 48:00.478
- NO, LES--
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

48:00.478 --> 48:02.313
NO, I KNOW THAT
YOU KNOW WHAT'S--

48:02.313 --> 48:04.182
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
- WE HAVE TO GO, LES.

48:04.182 --> 48:05.951
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

48:05.951 --> 48:08.119
- NO, I DO KNOW--
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

48:08.119 --> 48:11.289
OKAY? YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.

48:11.289 --> 48:14.125
I HAVE A CLUE.
NOT YOU, ME.

48:14.125 --> 48:16.561
COME ON, MAN, LET HIM GO.
YOU'RE SCARING THE SHIT
OUT OF HIM.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.829
SORRY, LES.

48:20.999 --> 48:22.934
HAA!

48:39.350 --> 48:40.618
( dog barking )

48:49.094 --> 48:51.362
( distant
siren wails )

48:53.698 --> 48:55.366
Jonas:
GET THIS ONE:

48:55.366 --> 48:58.203
"I SAW A PIECE OF SHIT ON
THE SIDEWALK THE OTHER DAY--

48:58.203 --> 49:01.872
NOT DOG-SHIT,
BUT FROM A PERSON

49:01.872 --> 49:03.708
AND IT MADE ME
FEEL SO HOPELESS,

49:03.708 --> 49:07.045
NOT JUST FOR WHOEVER
WENT THERE, BUT FOR EVERY
PERSON ON THE PLANET,

49:07.045 --> 49:09.314
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN."

49:12.217 --> 49:15.053
I TOLD YOU HE
WAS A BASKETCASE BEFORE
HE EVER CAME TO US.

49:15.053 --> 49:17.055
PUT THAT DOWN,
PLEASE.

49:17.055 --> 49:18.723
HELP ME LOOK
FOR THE PILLS.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.725
FORGET
ABOUT THE PILLS.

49:20.725 --> 49:22.727
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
FORGET ABOUT
THE PILLS?

49:22.727 --> 49:25.063
I SAY WE WAIT FOR HIM
TO COME HOME,

49:25.063 --> 49:27.832
WE KNOCK THE FUCKER OUT...

49:29.634 --> 49:31.802
TIE HIM UP FOR
A FEW DAYS

49:31.802 --> 49:33.971
AND WAIT FOR
HIS POWERS TO GO AWAY.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.740
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

49:35.740 --> 49:37.442
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.110
WHY NOT?

49:39.110 --> 49:42.280
WE'RE NOT DEALING
WITH THE KIND OF
PEOPLE WE'RE USED TO.

49:42.280 --> 49:45.950
THIS KIND OF GUY COULD
DISAPPEAR OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH

49:45.950 --> 49:48.119
FOR A FEW DAYS,

49:48.119 --> 49:50.221
NOBODY WOULD CARE.

49:52.790 --> 49:54.892
NOBODY WOULD
EVEN NOTICE.

49:58.463 --> 50:01.132
NO NO NO NO NO,
I AM OUT.

50:01.132 --> 50:03.301
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.970
THIS KID'S GONNA GET HURT
RUNNING AROUND IN THAT STATE.

50:05.970 --> 50:08.139
SO WHAT IF
WE LOSE EVERYTHING?

50:08.139 --> 50:10.808
AT LEAST I CAN GET BACK TO
GETTING SOME SLEEP AT NIGHT.

50:10.808 --> 50:13.144
WELL, EXCUSE ME
FOR NOT GIVING A CRAP,

50:13.144 --> 50:15.746
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO
MUSTER UP ANY SYMPATHY
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

50:18.349 --> 50:19.950
( car beeps )

50:21.552 --> 50:23.188
AHH!

50:25.290 --> 50:27.225
REMEMBER ME NOW,
DOBSON?

50:33.231 --> 50:34.732
- ( lights hum )
- LEAVE 'EM OFF.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.834
I SAID OFF!

50:40.771 --> 50:43.608
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
THINK YOU COULD GET AWAY
THIS EASILY, DID YOU?

50:43.608 --> 50:45.776
HUH?

50:45.776 --> 50:48.213
OKAY, TURN ON
THE LIGHTS.

50:48.213 --> 50:50.315
NOT THE OVERHEAD ONE!

50:51.482 --> 50:52.917
THIS ONE.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.055
DON'T TRY ANYTHING FUNNY.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.891
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
DON'T DO IT.

51:00.891 --> 51:03.761
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
YOUR FILE THERE.

51:03.761 --> 51:05.430
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
ANYMORE.

51:05.430 --> 51:07.532
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY.
YOU'RE A LIAR.

51:07.532 --> 51:09.267
THEY MADE ME SHRED IT.

51:09.267 --> 51:10.768
YEAH, RIGHT.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.604
- LISTEN, LES, I'M VERY
SORRY FOR EVERYTHING--
- HA!

51:13.604 --> 51:16.741
HA! HA!
SO YOU ADMIT KNOWING ME?

51:16.741 --> 51:18.243
OF COURSE I KNOW YOU.

51:18.243 --> 51:21.179
YOU'RE WORKING FOR
THE SUITS, AREN'T YOU?

51:21.179 --> 51:23.114
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE A SEAT.

51:30.121 --> 51:33.090
NO, I'M FINE STANDING.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.059
CAN I SIT DOWN?

51:35.059 --> 51:36.894
YOU SIT DOWN.

51:36.894 --> 51:38.696
YOU SIT DOWN.

51:43.768 --> 51:47.104
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH TIME AND ENERGY

51:47.104 --> 51:49.774
I PUT INTO DEVELOPING
THIS MEDICATION.

51:49.774 --> 51:52.076
IT BECAME MY WHOLE LIFE.

51:52.076 --> 51:55.112
- WHEN?
- PARDON ME?

51:56.614 --> 51:58.416
WHEN DID YOU TURN ON ME?

51:58.416 --> 52:02.753
WE TESTED SPECIOPRIN
ON THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS,

52:02.753 --> 52:06.224
BUT YOU WERE THE FIRST
AND ONLY ONE TO HAVE
AN ADVERSE REACTION LIKE THIS.

52:06.224 --> 52:08.893
NO, BUT THIS IS NOT
AN ADVERSE REACTION.

52:08.893 --> 52:11.229
YOU WANTED ME TO FEEL BETTER.
YOU TOLD ME THAT.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.564
- YOU WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN.
- NO.

52:13.564 --> 52:17.668
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
WE GOT AN OFFER--
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HAPPEN.

52:17.668 --> 52:19.837
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OFFER?

52:19.837 --> 52:21.839
TO BUY US OUT--

52:21.839 --> 52:24.175
THE DRUG,
ALL OUR RESEARCH,

52:24.175 --> 52:26.511
THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS
GOING TO BE ABSORBED

52:26.511 --> 52:29.514
BY A SIZEABLE CORPORATION.
THAT'S--

52:29.514 --> 52:33.684
( laughs )
--THAT'S WHAT WE WORKED
ALL THIS TIME FOR.

52:33.684 --> 52:38.122
WE WERE AFRAID THAT YOUR
RESULTS WOULD SCARE THEM OFF.

52:42.927 --> 52:45.095
SO THIS IS--

52:45.095 --> 52:47.598
THIS IS ABOUT MONEY?

52:47.598 --> 52:50.100
WE'VE DONE A TERRIBLE
INJUSTICE TO YOU, LES,

52:50.100 --> 52:52.937
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

52:52.937 --> 52:55.773
BUT I'VE TOLD
MY PARTNERS I'M OUT.

52:55.773 --> 52:58.776
AND I'LL CONFIRM YOUR STORY
SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO

52:58.776 --> 53:01.612
TAKE LEGAL ACTION.
AND IF YOU ASK ME,

53:01.612 --> 53:04.114
YOU'LL HAVE A VERY STRONG
CASE AGAINST ALL OF US.

53:04.114 --> 53:07.618
BUT, LES,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

53:07.618 --> 53:10.120
THAT WE GET THE MEDICATION
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.956
- NO. NEVER.
- YES.

53:11.956 --> 53:14.225
I'LL NEVER LET YOU
TAKE MY POWERS AWAY.

53:14.225 --> 53:16.961
GIVE ME THE PILLS, LES.
LES!

53:16.961 --> 53:20.631
NO NO! COME ON,
SPIT 'EM OUT.
SPIT 'EM OUT, LES.

53:20.631 --> 53:22.967
SPIT 'EM OUT.
COME ON, SPIT 'EM OUT.

53:22.967 --> 53:24.869
LES!

53:26.036 --> 53:27.872
YOU CAN NEVER TAKE
MY POWERS AWAY--

53:27.872 --> 53:31.609
YOU CAN NEVER-- YOU CAN
NEVER TURN ME BACK INTO
THE PERSON I USED TO BE.

53:31.609 --> 53:33.878
NOBODY CAN!
NOBODY CAN.

53:50.261 --> 53:53.598
SO, NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.635
YOU DON'T SCARE ME
ANYMORE.

53:57.635 --> 54:00.838
GOOD. THEN WHY DON'T
YOU GET IN AND WE CAN
HAVE A NICE TALK?

54:00.838 --> 54:04.041
YOU CAN'T STOP ME NOW.
I'M TOO POWERFUL.

54:04.041 --> 54:06.677
I'M NOT THE KIND OF MAN
WHO TAKES KINDLY TO THREATS--

54:06.677 --> 54:09.447
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU ARE.

54:10.848 --> 54:15.119
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH GUYS
LIKE YOU MY WHOLE LIFE.

54:18.656 --> 54:20.991
YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

54:20.991 --> 54:22.760
THAN EVERYONE ELSE,

54:24.395 --> 54:28.232
THAT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO WHOEVER YOU WANT.

54:28.232 --> 54:31.336
WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD CARE
IF YOU DISAPPEARED?

54:33.704 --> 54:36.206
WHO WOULD CARE
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

54:36.206 --> 54:38.376
WHO WOULD CARE ABOUT
THAT, HUH?

54:38.376 --> 54:41.379
DO YOU THINK THAT ANYONE
WOULD ACTUALLY CARE

54:41.379 --> 54:43.414
IF YOU DISAPPEARED?

54:43.414 --> 54:45.182
PARDON ME?

54:55.560 --> 54:57.828
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING NOW?

55:05.736 --> 55:08.873
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR TAI CHI, LES.

55:08.873 --> 55:12.643
WE'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE
A VERY FAIR DEAL WITH YOU.

55:26.991 --> 55:29.259
TRY TO MAKE ME DISAPPEAR?

55:30.928 --> 55:33.097
I'LL MAKE YOU DISAPPEAR.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.199
HUH?

55:38.503 --> 55:40.771
( train whistle blowing )

55:42.039 --> 55:44.141
( car door opens,
beeps )

55:55.219 --> 55:57.154
( footsteps approach )

56:17.408 --> 56:19.176
- ( punching )
- OHH!

56:21.211 --> 56:24.815
Jonas:
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND
OF MAN I AM, MOTHERFUCKER.

56:30.688 --> 56:32.957
DAHH!

56:38.896 --> 56:40.731
- ( kicking )
- AHH!

56:40.731 --> 56:42.166
OOH!

56:52.042 --> 56:55.379
YOU THINK DOBSON
COULD PROTECT YOU,

56:55.379 --> 56:58.315
HIM AND HIS SUDDEN
BURST OF CONSCIENCE?

57:08.759 --> 57:10.194
( punching )

57:14.064 --> 57:15.900
Theodore:
TAKE IT EASY, JONAS.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.068
YOU DON'T WANT TO
KILL THE GUY.

57:18.068 --> 57:20.404
Jonas:
WHY NOT? YOU HEARD HIM.

57:20.404 --> 57:21.872
HE'S TOO POWERFUL!

57:21.872 --> 57:24.208
HE THINKS HE CAN MAKE IT
ALL DISAPPEAR.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.876
HE THINKS HE CAN SUE US.

57:25.876 --> 57:28.045
HE THINKS HE CAN
MAKE IT ALL DISAPPEAR,

57:28.045 --> 57:29.714
EVERYTHING WE'VE
WORKED FOR!

57:29.714 --> 57:32.583
HE THINKS HE CAN
MAKE IT ALL DISAPPEAR!

57:32.583 --> 57:34.585
YOU WANT TO
LET THAT HAPPEN, THEODORE?

57:34.585 --> 57:37.922
EVERYTHING WE'VE
WORKED FOR--

57:37.922 --> 57:41.091
YOU WANT TO HAVE IT RUINED
BY SOME MAGGOT LIKE THIS GUY?

57:41.091 --> 57:42.927
- SOME NOBODY!
- ( kicking )

57:42.927 --> 57:44.695
Theodore:
STOP IT, JONAS!

57:47.932 --> 57:50.868
Jonas:
YOU'RE A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF SHIT!

57:50.868 --> 57:53.370
- SAY IT!
- OOH!

57:53.370 --> 57:55.372
YOU'RE A NOBODY!

57:55.372 --> 57:57.207
I'M A WORTHLESS--

57:57.207 --> 57:59.209
YOU'RE A NOBODY!

57:59.209 --> 58:02.379
OH! OOH!
I'M A NOBODY.

58:02.379 --> 58:04.549
YOU'RE NOTHING!

58:04.549 --> 58:05.983
OH!

58:11.689 --> 58:13.357
YOU'RE NOTHING!

58:13.357 --> 58:15.960
I'M NOTHING.
I'M NOTHING.

58:17.795 --> 58:20.464
YOU'RE A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF SHIT.

58:20.464 --> 58:22.466
- ( hitting )
- OH!

58:22.466 --> 58:24.468
I'M A WORTHLESS

58:24.468 --> 58:26.403
PIECE OF SHIT.

58:31.108 --> 58:33.944
- ( hitting )
- OH!

58:33.944 --> 58:36.046
I'M A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF SHIT.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.918
- ( hitting )
- OOOH!

58:42.186 --> 58:45.289
STOP IT. OW.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.031
I SWEAR,

58:54.031 --> 58:55.866
IF I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN,

58:55.866 --> 58:58.803
IF I EVER HEAR FROM
YOU AGAIN, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

59:00.237 --> 59:02.306
A FUCKING DEAD MAN.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.149
FUCK YOU.

59:12.149 --> 59:13.818
YOU SEE?
( laughing )

59:13.818 --> 59:16.821
YOU CAN'T REASON
WITH THIS MAGGOT.

59:16.821 --> 59:18.823
Theodore:
PUT IT DOWN, LES.

59:18.823 --> 59:21.525
- YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.
- NOOO!

59:21.525 --> 59:25.129
- NO NO!
- ( hitting )

59:25.129 --> 59:27.564
- NO!
- ( Jonas groaning )

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:10.074
Les's voice:
MOST PEOPLE NEVER STOP
TO THINK

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.576
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED
WITH BEING A SUPERHERO.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.079
INSTEAD THEY TEND TO
FOCUS ON

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.581
THE MORE GLAMOROUS ASPECTS
OF OUR LIVES.

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:20.084
THEY FOCUS ON
THE POWERS WE HAVE,

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.519
THE THINGS WE CAN DO
THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN.

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:26.323
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE
TRUTH IS THAT,

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.660
WHILE BEING DIFFERENT
FROM EVERYONE CAN BE
EXCITING AT FIRST,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.263
ULTIMATELY IT CAN
GET A LITTLE LONELY.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:50.380
I'M SORRY.

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:55.920
I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW
WHO TO TRUST ANYMORE.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.688
I DON'T--

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.558
( groans )

01:01:05.562 --> 01:01:08.232
THEY COULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN TO YOU.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:10.400
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
I KNOW YOU.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.837
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.377
WHAT HAPP--

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:25.549
HAPP-- HAPPENED--

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:28.152
TO-- TO-- TO--

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.057
SHIT.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.726
I'M SORRY.
I SOUND--

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:39.429
S-- S-- STUPID.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.199
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU SOUND.

01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:46.536
I DO.

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.775
ARE YOU ON DRUGS?

01:01:50.775 --> 01:01:52.777
YEAH.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:54.945
I AM.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.782
OH.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:02:00.450
WHAT KIND OF DRUGS
DID YOU TAKE?

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.952
PILLS.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:05.956
I TOOK-- I TOOK
ALL MY PILLS.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:08.458
YOU SEE?

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.294
YEAH.

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.629
OKAY.

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:15.732
UH, WE REALLY NEED TO--

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.037
WE REALLY NEED TO...

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:24.041
G-G-G-GET YOU SOME HELP.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:27.344
TELL ME ONE THING,
PLEASE.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:30.047
WHAT IS IT?

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:32.549
DOES THIS PLACE
HAVE A BATHROOM?

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:34.151
( vomiting )

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:48.032
I THOUGHT-- I THOUGHT
I GOT RID OF 'EM ALL.

01:02:48.032 --> 01:02:49.900
THE PILLS?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.735
JUST--
NO, THE SUITS.

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:55.072
THE SUITS, THEY--
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE
ME ALONE.

01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:56.573
THEY WOULDN'T,

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:59.076
SO I HAD TO DO IT.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:01.511
I DID.

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:08.685
D-D-DID YOU
HURT SOMEONE?

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:12.022
Jonas:
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A VERY NICE THING TO DO.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:14.758
- HA--
- WHAT'S WRONG?

01:03:14.758 --> 01:03:16.593
NOTHING.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:19.596
I THINK THERE'S--
THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.431
THAT I'M LOSING MY MIND.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.368
I THINK
I'M LOSING MY MIND.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:27.604
Jonas:
COME ON, LES!

01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:30.140
CAN'T YOU SEE ME?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.242
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.180
AREN'T YOU GONNA
FINISH ME OFF?

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.516
IT-- IT'S OKAY.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.818
SHH.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.521
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:48.025
DOES THIS DOOR LOCK
FROM THE OUTSIDE?

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:50.194
OH, I-- I THINK SO.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:53.197
CAN YOU-- CAN YOU
LOCK ME IN HERE?

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.799
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:58.302
PLEASE, I'M NOT SAFE
TO BE AROUND.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.404
YOU HAVE TO LET ME
TAKE YOU TO THE--

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:05.775
HO-- HO--

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:09.413
TO THE E.R.

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:11.515
PLEASE.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.218
PLEASE.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.121
PLEASE.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:21.158
YOU HAVE TO LOCK IT
FROM OUT THERE.

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:23.760
UH, HOLD YOUR HORSES.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:41.511
THAT-- THAT SHOULD GET YOU
THROUGH TILL MORNING.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:49.186
HEY!

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:52.289
YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:00.230
G-G-GOOD NIGHT, LES.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.266
GOODBYE, SUPER-POWERS.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.841
( groaning )

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:55.152
( elevator shifting )

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:04.861
( dings )

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:18.042
( dings )

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.834
( grunts )

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.521
( groaning )

01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:46.850
Les's voice:
I SUPPOSE THIS WILL BE
MY LAST JOURNAL ENTRY.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:51.187
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO
RETURNING TO MY OLD LIFE.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.358
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WITH SO MANY BILLIONS

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:56.526
AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET,

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:59.696
MOST OF US CAN'T BE
UNIQUE OR IMPORTANT IN
ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:03.032
WE GO TO SLEEP,
WE WAKE UP,

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.535
WE GO TO WORK,
WE EAT,

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.704
WE SPEND TIME
WITH FRIENDS,

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.140
WE WATCH TV,
MAYBE WE EVEN FALL IN LOVE.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.678
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MAGICAL POWERS

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:17.180
AND WE DON'T HAVE
ANY GREAT BATTLES TO FIGHT,

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.684
NO EVIL FORCES
TO DEFEAT,

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:23.853
AND NO MYSTERIOUS MEN
IN SUITS CHASING AFTER US.

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:26.456
WE JUST HAVE REALITY.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:32.729
AND BELIEVING
ANYTHING ELSE IS JUST--

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.999
WELL, BELIEVING ANYTHING ELSE
IS JUST CRAZY, ISN'T IT?

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.452
( car approaches )

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:01.458
( brakes screech )

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.095
( car door opens )

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.586
( sighs )

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.855
WE BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:37.193
BUT HE--

01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:39.963
WE DID WHAT
WE HAD TO DO.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.803
COME ON.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:09.726
( car door slams )

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:29.873
TED, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.475
TED!

01:13:31.475 --> 01:13:33.142
TED!

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:16.452
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME STOP.

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.433
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME STOP.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.183
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME STOP.
