WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.636
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, let's talk Jane.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.738
She's been through so much.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.607
She got married, but then...

00:06.640 --> 00:07.608
I woke up feeling a little off.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.043
Thought it was pre-test jitters.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.578
Well, how do you feel now?
Totally fine.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.246
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the worst thing happened,

00:12.280 --> 00:13.581
and Michael died.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.715
And so Jane wrote a book

00:14.748 --> 00:16.417
about their love story,

00:16.450 --> 00:18.552
and when it got published,
well, Jane was

00:18.586 --> 00:19.787
pretty freaking excited.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.422
Plus, things were going great

00:21.455 --> 00:22.623
with her boyfriend, Adam.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.791
My publisher set up

00:23.824 --> 00:25.393
a mini book tour.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.560
I was wondering
if you wanted to come.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.596
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He even drew

00:28.629 --> 00:30.231
the cover art for her book.
Unfortunately...

00:30.264 --> 00:32.300
I'm moving to L.A.
I can't believe this.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.402
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
so that officially sucked.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.770
Also having relationship woes,
Jane's parents.

00:36.804 --> 00:40.674
On the bright side, Alba and
Jorge were still going strong.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.677
Not doing as well...
our Rafael.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.646
See, his sister, Luisa,
finally decided

00:45.679 --> 00:48.449
to give him back his hotel
shares-- only problem,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.651
Luisa was hallucinating
some man named Carl.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.188
You see Carl here, right?
No.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.289
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so she checked herself

00:55.323 --> 00:56.557
into a psychiatric hospital.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.659
But, OMG, Carl was real.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.728
See, Petra's twin sister,
Anezka,

01:00.761 --> 01:02.596
and their mother, Magda,
set Luisa up

01:02.630 --> 01:04.232
to make her think
she was losing her mind,

01:04.265 --> 01:05.699
so they could assume
control of the hotel.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.269
In the event
of her incapacitation,

01:08.302 --> 01:10.271
all her hotel shares
go to Anezka.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.705
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so
Petra tried to drive a wedge

01:11.739 --> 01:13.207
between Magda and Anezka,

01:13.241 --> 01:14.742
which left Anezka sad
and confused,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.510
and, well...

01:16.544 --> 01:18.579
And I won't leave you
hanging any longer,

01:18.612 --> 01:19.747
so let's begin.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.751
There were three times
on her journey

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
to becoming a published author

01:25.619 --> 01:29.390
when Jane Gloriana Villanueva
really needed a push.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.860
And each time,
Rafael was there.

01:32.893 --> 01:36.564
This, of course,
was the first time.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.732
Well, it depends.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.469
Am I being practical or brave?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.237
Be brave.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.839
I'm a writer?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.609
I have never said that
out loud before.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.544
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, suddenly

01:50.578 --> 01:54.615
a window of possibilities
opened for Jane.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.217
And I'm not gonna
let stupid Adam

01:56.250 --> 01:57.685
ruin my book tour!

01:57.718 --> 01:59.287
Even though he
already ruined

01:59.320 --> 02:00.721
my book-launch party
by suddenly deciding

02:00.754 --> 02:02.156
to move across the country,

02:02.190 --> 02:03.791
even though I asked
him three times--

02:03.824 --> 02:06.394
three times, Ma--
if he was sure he was in,

02:06.427 --> 02:10.464
and every single time he said...
"Yeah, I'm all in."

02:10.498 --> 02:12.800
I mean, who does that?
Men.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.502
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Present company excluded,
of course.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.370
I'd rather go with you
on my book tour, anyway.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.638
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
"Tour" is a little ambitious.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.407
It's two stops.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.176
Well, it's perfect timing,
because I need time away

02:22.210 --> 02:23.244
from your father.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.314
What's this?
Our itinerary.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.349
Okay. Well, this is exciting.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.684
Exactly.
So exciting, yeah.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.186
And Adam the jackass won't be

02:32.220 --> 02:33.721
a part of any of it,
which is his loss,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.889
because this is gonna be
so much freakin' fun!

02:37.725 --> 02:39.760
Yeah!
(mutters)

02:42.430 --> 02:43.964
What are you doing here?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.200
I wanted to loan
my daughter

02:46.234 --> 02:47.835
my classic convertible

02:47.868 --> 02:50.371
for her first
book tour.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.341
Jane, don't you
take those keys.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.575
Ma,

02:54.608 --> 02:55.676
I'm staying out
of your fight,

02:55.709 --> 02:57.711
but we're taking
the convertible!

03:00.614 --> 03:01.949
Come on, Xo.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.751
I said I was sorry.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.786
That you made me feel guilty
for the last five years

03:05.819 --> 03:06.987
for not telling you about Jane?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.257
When you already had
a sneaking suspicion...

03:09.290 --> 03:10.824
A small sneaking suspicion.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.327
...that I'd
had the baby.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.795
(horn honking)

03:14.828 --> 03:17.498
Look... I just need
some space from you.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.500
(honking continues)
JANE:
Mateo!

03:19.533 --> 03:20.768
Stop honking the horn!

03:20.801 --> 03:21.969
I got him,
I got him.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.704
(honking continues)

03:23.737 --> 03:26.307
Okay, so you have
my itinerary.
Received.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.776
And I assume there's a backup
copy waiting in my in-box.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.511
*

03:30.544 --> 03:32.813
You are going
on a book tour.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.882
This is huge.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.754
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And,
friends, that's when he said...

03:40.788 --> 03:44.625
(horn honking)

03:44.658 --> 03:46.827
Okay, now my mom's
honking-- I should go.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.567
(engine idling)
You have to admit,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.636
this is a cool car.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.805
I'm having Rogelio sell it
after this trip.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.973
But, yeah, we're like
Thelma and Louise.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.775
(excited squeal)
Ooh.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.243
What should we listen to?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.415
Mom?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.884
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.
I don't recall Thelma or Louise

04:10.918 --> 04:12.653
bringing along a grandmother.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.688
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.053
(engine revs)

04:46.086 --> 04:47.888
(tires squeal)

05:02.069 --> 05:03.671
First of all, I'm
going the speed limit,

05:03.704 --> 05:04.738
and second of all,
no, I can't,

05:04.772 --> 05:06.840
because I have to be in
Palm Beach by 2:00 p.m.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.376
to check in and get
ready for the reading.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.410
(ringtone playing)
Oh.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.946
I'm trying to.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.914
It's your editor.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.015
Speakerphone.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.750
Speakerphone!
Everyone shush!

05:16.784 --> 05:18.085
Jeremy, hey.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.920
So, listen, huge news.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.422
You are part
of a double-billing tonight.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.723
She's just confirmed.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.559
Uh, who confirmed?
Iyanla Vanzant.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.061
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG. Yes, Iyanla, fix my life.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.564
Who's that?

05:30.598 --> 05:31.965
My grandmother.
Sorry.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.967
Hey, Grandma! Iyanla's the host

05:34.001 --> 05:35.903
of Iyanla: Fix My Life on OWN,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.371
and a total Oprah insider.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.407
Which means Jane's crowd tonight

05:39.440 --> 05:40.808
will be big.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.643
So kill it, okay, Jane?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.912
And don't ever put me
on speaker again.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.847
Well, that's exciting.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
Again?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.958
MATEO:
I have to go to the bathroom.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.126
Again?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.728
My tummy still hurts.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.096
(clicks tongue, sighs)

06:03.130 --> 06:04.798
He does feel a little warm.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.634
(sighs):
Go on, bud.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.569
And Daddy's gonna
get you some Tylenol.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.672
And if you get worse, Papa's
gonna call me at work, okay?

06:11.705 --> 06:12.906
Okay.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.645
Should we tell Jane?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.812
No.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.013
She's on her book tour.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.949
We don't need to call her.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.684
*

06:23.717 --> 06:27.054
Call me if you need
anything, anything at all.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.022
I know it's your first
time alone with Mateo
since you got home,

06:29.056 --> 06:31.492
so I just wanted you
to be prepared.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.061
I also e-mailed you a backup--
it should be in your in-box.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.963
Emergency contacts, nap times,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.765
what to do if he's
cranky or he won't eat

06:37.798 --> 06:39.166
or if you can't find Mr. Monkey.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.202
And this is where I'm staying
in Fort Myers.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.505
You nervous?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
(whispers):
So nervous.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.709
I haven't seen Michael's mom
since the funeral.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.778
You don't have to ask
her permission, you know.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.012
To write about him.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.047
Yes, I do.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.149
Okay, Mr. Sweetface,
Mommy's got to go.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.718
No, Mommy!

06:57.751 --> 06:59.186
No!
It's okay,

06:59.219 --> 07:02.923
you'll be fine.
Mommy! I want Mommy!

07:02.956 --> 07:04.057
I want Mommy.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.494
Oh, I know
you do, buddy.

07:06.527 --> 07:10.130
Mwah. But Mommy's gonna be back
in two sleeps, okay?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.132
And you'll
feel better soon.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.770
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, geez. That's foreboding.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.772
Is that... Anezka's?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.974
I'll remind you
that Petra's sister

07:21.008 --> 07:24.612
had recently been found hanging
in one of the guest rooms.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.014
No. Anezka's body was
cremated, so we don't need

07:27.047 --> 07:28.816
a casket, which
I keep telling them.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.984
MAN:
I spoke to the boss.
He said the mistake

07:31.018 --> 07:32.620
must have been
with the funeral home, so...

07:32.653 --> 07:33.821
you got to deal with them.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.523
Yeah, we can't take it back now.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.824
No, of course you can't.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.159
Krishna, handle this.
Wh-Where do you...

07:39.192 --> 07:40.694
want them to put it?
I don't care!

07:40.728 --> 07:42.830
Just out of sight
of the guests.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.032
Why are you even
having a funeral?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.967
You're obviously not
mourning Anezka.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.002
Of course I am.
She committed suicide

07:49.036 --> 07:51.972
after I tried to drive a wedge
between her and my mother,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.742
so I feel guilty,
all right?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.578
Fine. Her death was so public,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.913
if I don't seem sad,
it'll look bad for the hotel.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.615
Mm.
(sighs):
So...

08:01.649 --> 08:03.651
I'm going to set out
the urn with her ashes,

08:03.684 --> 08:05.553
people can say
good-bye to her,

08:05.586 --> 08:08.221
and then this whole chapter
of my life will be over.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.559
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. A chapter closed.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.695
Just like Jane's
relationship with Adam.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.270
I-I booked this room
as a joke for me and Adam.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.107
It's cool. I'm fine.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.141
Screw Adam!

08:28.175 --> 08:29.677
He's not here.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.012
(chuckles)
More champagne for Mama.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.784
Oh, he must have forgotten
to cancel these.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.688
"To Xiomara. XOXO, Ro."

08:40.721 --> 08:42.690
I'm sorry, hon,
they're not from Adam.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.024
Please.
(scoffs)

08:44.057 --> 08:45.759
What would they even say?

08:45.793 --> 08:47.260
"Sorry for being a dick
and leaving you,

08:47.294 --> 08:49.763
"the same way I left you
nine years ago,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.699
"but that's just who I am--

08:51.732 --> 08:54.802
a stupid, lying,
tattooed jerkface"?!

08:54.835 --> 08:58.005
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, that would be a weird
thing to write on a card.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.139
Uh, hon?
Mm-hmm?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.708
Y-You're not gonna bring

09:00.741 --> 09:03.076
that much, uh, rage
to the reading?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.750
I am not gonna
yell, Abuela!

09:09.783 --> 09:12.920
I just find it crazy that I gave
him three chances to back out

09:12.953 --> 09:15.088
before we got serious. Three!

09:15.122 --> 09:17.357
One, I get-- you're
still figuring it out.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.926
Go ahead. Even two.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.260
Two is like...

09:20.293 --> 09:22.095
"I don't know, you know?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.197
Let's just see
where this goes."

09:24.231 --> 09:25.933
But three!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.234
Three!

09:27.267 --> 09:28.201
(grunts loudly)

09:28.235 --> 09:31.338
Sweetie?
No, this is good.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.874
This is good. I'm-I'm
getting it out now!

09:33.907 --> 09:36.043
I feel good. I feel better.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.211
Okay, now let's just
go to the reading,

09:38.245 --> 09:41.214
so I can talk about
how freaking great true love is!

09:41.248 --> 09:44.151
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, dear, this could get dark.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.352
"There was a light on inside,

09:45.385 --> 09:46.987
"and his heart stopped
for a beat

09:47.020 --> 09:48.989
"as he imagined Josephine there,

09:49.022 --> 09:52.225
just beyond the wood of the door
and glass of the windows."

09:52.259 --> 09:55.262
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, phew.
She didn't yell at anyone.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.165
WOMAN: All right,
thank you both so much.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.001
And now we have time
for some questions.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.904
Yes.
Iyanla,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.238
I get what
you were saying

10:05.272 --> 10:07.140
about developing a relationship
with yourself

10:07.174 --> 10:08.942
before developing one
with someone else.

10:08.976 --> 10:09.977
But is it still okay

10:10.010 --> 10:11.912
to want to be swept off my feet?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.014
Like in a big romantic way?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.315
Is it okay to want it?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.685
Oh, well, absolutely it is.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.788
Who in their right mind
wouldn't want this?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.122
(laughter)

10:22.155 --> 10:23.423
I mean...

10:23.456 --> 10:26.259
I'm gonna need you
to talk to me

10:26.293 --> 10:29.329
about this lusty cover.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.204
Well, it was designed
by a very talented artist...

10:38.338 --> 10:40.173
...who, um...

10:40.207 --> 10:42.275
who...

10:42.309 --> 10:44.144
(crying): who dumped me
and broke my heart.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.413
(Jane sobbing)

10:46.446 --> 10:49.149
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, at least she didn't yell.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.093
What a disaster.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.062
No one even wanted
to buy my book.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
Mm-hmm.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.167
Mm, probably to see

11:07.200 --> 11:08.802
if it contains signs
that I'm insane.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.438
Are you really reading
Iyanla's book right now, Ma?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.340
I thought maybe
she'd have advice.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.843
She was very insightful
talking you down at the store.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.378
(sobbing):
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.981
I always say that
lives fall apart

11:21.014 --> 11:23.416
when they need to be
put back together.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.852
(sniffles)
Mm-hmm.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.086
(squeals)

11:26.119 --> 11:28.155
(phone ringing)

11:28.188 --> 11:30.490
Oh, great.
It's my editor.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.392
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna have
to tell him what happened.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.328
Jeremy, hey.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.864
You cried?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.098
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I guess he knows.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.166
A little, yeah.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.167
A little?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.401
Jane, there were audience tweets

11:41.434 --> 11:43.904
with the hashtag #SnotFalling.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.105
This is not good.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.106
What do we do now?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.407
I don't know.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.408
Hopefully you'll get
a good review soon

11:48.441 --> 11:50.077
to give you some momentum

11:50.110 --> 11:51.344
going into the Romance Writers
Convention,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.781
which will be livestreamed,
Jane.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.415
So, no crying. You cannot cry.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.785
Okay. I won't cry.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.187
I promise.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.390
I really don't
feel good, Papa.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.758
Don't worry.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.759
You'll feel better soon.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.360
That's a Papa promise.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.506
JANE:
You were right.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.943
I feel better after a shower.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.345
(blow-dryer blowing)

12:38.525 --> 12:39.960
Mateo has a 102 fever.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.829
Should we tell her?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.199
Oh, my God!

12:46.233 --> 12:47.968
My Romance Weekly book review
is out.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.136
Ah!
Oh. (chuckles)

12:49.169 --> 12:50.470
I am so nervous.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.172
Okay, here it is.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.341
(exhales)

12:54.374 --> 12:56.176
"The author's actual backstory,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.511
"which has been highlighted
in promotional materials,

12:58.545 --> 13:01.882
is captivating, certainly."
Mm.

13:01.915 --> 13:07.387
"But... rendered
into fiction

13:07.420 --> 13:09.122
"so many steps removed,

13:09.156 --> 13:12.392
"it falls much flatter.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.061
"Whether it's the build-up

13:14.094 --> 13:17.164
"or the distance,
there is a sense here

13:17.197 --> 13:20.033
of promise unfulfilled."

13:21.601 --> 13:23.570
Oh, hon.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.405
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I can't believe it.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.573
I love that book so much.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.409
But to be fair,

13:29.442 --> 13:31.544
her best is yet to come.
(mouthing)

13:31.578 --> 13:33.513
Thanks for calling, Xo.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.415
Don't worry, I'm heading home
now to check on him

13:35.448 --> 13:37.417
and I'll text you an update.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.186
Thanks.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.453
(line dialing)

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
Mateo got worse
and you texted Xo

13:46.026 --> 13:46.994
instead of me?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.495
I was about to, but...

13:48.528 --> 13:50.130
Okay, look, I know we don't
always see eye-to-eye

13:50.163 --> 13:51.331
and it's obvious that you don't
like me very much.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.100
What?
But here's the thing.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.535
You don't have to like me,
but you do have to respect me

13:55.568 --> 13:56.937
because I am Mateo's father.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.438
So, get him ready
because I am coming home

13:58.471 --> 14:02.109
and I am taking him
to the doctor.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.011
(sighs)

14:04.044 --> 14:05.578
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.948
I'll call if
anything changes.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.653
I'm sorry.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.188
I feel bad.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.523
I know this was an
important weekend for you,

14:16.556 --> 14:18.591
but we didn't prepare
for if he was sick.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.027
I'm glad you brought him here.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.228
I-I was worried, too.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.595
(sighs)

14:24.664 --> 14:26.566
Why is your manuscript
in the trash?

14:26.599 --> 14:29.569
Uh, well, I saw Patricia

14:29.602 --> 14:32.439
and she didn't exactly
give me her blessing.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.608
What? What'd she say?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.511
Well...

14:38.545 --> 14:40.613
she blames me
for Michael's death.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.681
She thinks if I had just

14:41.714 --> 14:43.450
taken him to the hospital

14:43.483 --> 14:44.584
when he first started
feeling sick,

14:44.617 --> 14:46.920
(crying):
then he'd still be alive.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.521
Jane.
Hmm?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.090
You know that
it's not your fault.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.992
It's fine.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.593
I'll write something else.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.598
XIOMARA: You need to stop
looking at that.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.635
I guess the good news is,
is that after the review,

15:02.669 --> 15:04.637
nobody's gonna read
my awful book.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.372
You know what?
That's it.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.340
We are getting
out of this room

15:07.374 --> 15:08.675
and we are going
out on the town.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.643
What?

15:10.677 --> 15:11.979
You can wear
something of mine.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.247
We're doing this.
Like Iyanla says,

15:14.281 --> 15:16.984
"What you don't do can
create the same regrets

15:17.017 --> 15:18.185
as the mistakes you make."

15:18.218 --> 15:20.420
Oh, please, Ma.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.554
You've only read one chapter.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.656
It was a good one.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.724
(laughs)
Come on.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.360
Let's go have a good time.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.362
I promise you'll
feel better.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.598
ELSA:
Come on!

15:31.631 --> 15:34.501
Hurry, Mommy.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.436
Look, Anna died.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.737
Oh, my God. Anna,
get out of there.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.539
Very funny.
(Elsa and Anna giggling)

15:39.572 --> 15:41.541
Girls. (grunts)

15:41.574 --> 15:43.010
What is this doing here?

15:43.043 --> 15:45.012
Someone delivered it.
Great.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.346
Well, call Krishna and tell her
when I asked her to move it,

15:46.379 --> 15:47.714
I did not mean here.
Okay.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.349
Girls, stop that.
Girls, stop that.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.650
Oh!
Oops.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.718
Sorry, Mommy.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.120
It's okay. I'm fine.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.656
I'm fine. Let's just go down
to the funeral.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.460
Ah. Look sad.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.302
All right, wait here.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.404
I have to go rinse my eyes.
Behave.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.676
Ugh. Don't let my mother
get near them.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.780
(sniffles)

16:20.813 --> 16:22.982
(woman squeaks)

16:26.486 --> 16:27.687
Who's there?

16:36.763 --> 16:39.332
Hello, beautiful sister.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.633
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I did tell you

16:40.667 --> 16:42.669
that she didn't kill herself.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.442
You're alive?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.643
No, but it can't be. I...

16:50.677 --> 16:51.811
I saw your body hanging.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.213
Th-There were EMTs.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.685
Not real EMTs. Actors.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.420
Mother and I
always be hiring actors

17:00.453 --> 17:01.654
to play prank on people.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.423
A good example is Carl.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.725
He is part of Orlando-based
acting troupe,

17:05.758 --> 17:07.394
and he plays evil Disney villain

17:07.427 --> 17:08.728
in big parade. He plays...

17:08.761 --> 17:10.430
Now I'm trying to remember

17:10.463 --> 17:12.499
who he plays. Not Gaston.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.834
Anezka! I don't care
what villain he plays.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.636
You faked your own death?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.605
Yes, exactly.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.174
Well, because
I was being so confused

17:21.208 --> 17:22.742
about whether
I should trust you or Mother,

17:22.775 --> 17:25.478
a-and I just not knowing
how to decide.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.115
And then it felt like fate.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.650
I want my funeral to be epic.
I want people to weep.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.420
I want them to feel sorry
for taking me for granted

17:33.453 --> 17:35.688
because they won't realize
until I'm gone

17:35.722 --> 17:38.291
how much they really love me.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.293
ANEZKA:
And then I realize

17:40.327 --> 17:43.230
I need to see
who really loved me.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.799
And now I see
it was beautiful sister.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.435
Still beautiful

17:48.468 --> 17:51.504
even when you
is crying your eyes out over me.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.540
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,

17:53.573 --> 17:56.309
Petra realized
what she had to do.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.345
I just...

17:58.378 --> 18:00.513
can't believe you're here.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.549
I was heartbroken.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.384
Oh.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.853
I'm just so happy. (chuckles)

18:06.886 --> 18:08.455
See, I told you
you could trust me.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.258
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow, she's good.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.161
She should join Carl's
Orlando-based acting troupe.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.229
And I hate to tell you this.
(sniffles)

18:16.263 --> 18:17.897
Mother wasn't sad at all.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.500
But you were always
hating Mother.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.901
Maybe you are lying right now

18:21.934 --> 18:23.603
to convince me not to trust her.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.139
Really?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.779
ANEZKA: Oh, yes,
that's who Carl played.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.247
Captain Hook.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.348
Anezka, focus.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.351
Look, she's yawning
at your funeral.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.819
Maybe she's just tired

18:39.852 --> 18:43.290
from sleepless nights
of grieving.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.557
Well, she still thinks
you're dead.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.459
So I'll prove it.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.561
* Let me know if you want...

18:48.595 --> 18:50.430
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, looks like someone else

18:50.463 --> 18:51.531
went incognito.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.599
* To a higher place

18:52.632 --> 18:56.503
* 'Cause there's a whole
lot of fun in the city *

18:56.536 --> 18:58.538
So it's good
we didn't tell Jane.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.541
* Let me show you
how to rock my way *

19:01.574 --> 19:04.911
A toast to...

19:04.944 --> 19:06.879
Oh, this beer is lukewarm.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.349
Just like my review. (laughs)

19:09.382 --> 19:10.850
Honey, you have to stop
thinking about it.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.519
Focus on something else.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.387
Adam?

19:15.622 --> 19:17.690
Damn it.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.392
(crying):
Oh.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.727
Remind me again
why he's the worst.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.566
Mmm.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.537
Exactly. He sucks.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.539
Men suck.
They think they can just

19:32.572 --> 19:34.607
spring things on you, and you're
not supposed to react.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.247
What are you talking about, Ma?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.717
He did? When?

20:02.502 --> 20:03.736
You just left?

20:05.905 --> 20:08.575
H-He proposed to you.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.518
(laughing)

20:21.788 --> 20:23.890
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And now to a very different

20:23.923 --> 20:24.824
mother-daughter relationship.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.493
If you're not done packing
in five minutes,

20:26.526 --> 20:27.627
I'm calling security.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.529
I have one hand. It takes time.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.568
I thought you might like this.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.504
It was Anezka's.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.806
Ugh. Why would I want that?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.475
Because your dead daughter
clung to it every night

20:42.509 --> 20:43.710
while she slept
at the orphanage.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.777
Might be a nice memento.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.751
You really have no feelings
for her?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.453
If Anezka was stupid enough
to kill herself

20:53.486 --> 20:55.588
when she finally had control
of the hotel,

20:55.622 --> 20:57.390
then she deserve to die.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.460
ANEZKA:
Well, now I am knowing

21:00.493 --> 21:02.462
how you really
feel, Mother.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.663
(gasps)

21:03.696 --> 21:05.532
You're alive!

21:05.565 --> 21:08.301
God has given me
a miracle!

21:08.335 --> 21:11.404
Save it, Mother. You would
never make it in Carl's troupe.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.775
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking
of wonderful actors...

21:15.808 --> 21:17.677
RAFAEL:
Mateo's asleep.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.079
His fever broke at the
doctor's. Just a virus,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.715
and he'll be better
in a few days.

21:22.749 --> 21:26.085
And I'm sorry for
yelling at you.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.388
No, you were right.
I should have respected you

21:28.421 --> 21:29.856
as Matelio's father.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.624
You don't look so good.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.925
Is that necessary?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.727
I apologized.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.963
I mean... you don't look well.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.798
Oh. I'm fine.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.801
Except for the fact that
it's 30 degrees in here.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.636
Um...

21:43.670 --> 21:47.707
You must have thought
about marrying Jorge, though.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.151
Aw.
But you don't have

21:59.185 --> 22:01.421
to feel the same
thing, right?

22:01.454 --> 22:04.491
I mean, things with Jorge
are pretty nice. You guys

22:04.524 --> 22:06.125
get along so well.
At this point

22:06.158 --> 22:07.860
in your life,
that's pretty good, right?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.896
Yeah.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.832
Meaning that...

22:15.802 --> 22:18.438
Oh, come on, Abuela,
you know she didn't mean that.
That's not what I meant.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.148
(scoffs)

22:29.181 --> 22:30.850
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And...

22:30.883 --> 22:32.819
that's why
I don't drink tequila.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.426
Abuela, stop.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.404
That is not what Mom meant.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.805
She just meant that, at

22:52.839 --> 22:55.908
different stages, you need
and want different things.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.376
Ah.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.914
Abuela, stop.
You're being drunk and dramatic.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.817
Ah.
You are! Mom is not trying
to put you in a diaper.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.719
Anyone can see that
you're still young!

23:06.753 --> 23:09.489
Oh! And you know what
young people do?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.924
Mm. They dance. So come on.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.463
There is a floor
and we're about to dance on it,

23:16.496 --> 23:17.897
so it's about to be
a dance floor!

23:17.930 --> 23:20.800
No. No, no, no,
no, no. I am going

23:20.833 --> 23:22.735
to be drunk and dramatic, too.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.504
And you said this trip was
about me, and I want to dance.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.506
Come on!

23:26.539 --> 23:29.075
*

23:29.108 --> 23:31.744
What is that?
You can do better!

23:31.778 --> 23:33.746
Ay!

23:33.780 --> 23:36.549
(whoops)

23:36.583 --> 23:38.451
Break it down! Oh!

23:38.485 --> 23:40.587
Whoo, whoo! That's
what I'm talking about!

23:40.620 --> 23:42.455
That's my grandma, y'all!
That's my grandma!

23:42.489 --> 23:43.222
Go, Grandma!

23:43.255 --> 23:45.157
That's my grandma!
Uh-huh.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.225
Your grandma ain't as
hot as this. Come on.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.894
What are you guys doing?

23:49.562 --> 23:51.864
So you're not mad anymore?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
I'm sorry! I...
Okay!

23:56.503 --> 23:57.303
You're bringing down the vibe!

23:57.336 --> 23:58.605
Why don't you dance
your apology?

23:58.638 --> 23:59.639
What?

24:01.974 --> 24:04.511
(whoops)
Yeah!

24:04.544 --> 24:06.245
Come on! Yeah!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.847
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Dang, Alba,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.482
those hips don't lie!

24:13.219 --> 24:14.654
Yeah!

24:16.556 --> 24:18.090
What the hell
is this doing here?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.493
The delivery company
can't pick it up until tomorrow.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.261
I was trying
to keep it out of sight.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.096
And you thought smack-dab
in front of my office

24:24.130 --> 24:25.632
was the ideal spot.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.099
Yes?
Put it outside
the hotel

24:27.133 --> 24:29.001
where the guests don't see it
and I won't see it.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.503
Understand?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.105
(sighs)

24:33.139 --> 24:33.973
(screams)

24:34.006 --> 24:35.174
(screams, trills)

24:35.207 --> 24:36.809
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Huh.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.512
Kind of confusing when
they're both dressed as Petra.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.780
I'll give them name tags.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.882
So, how did it go?

24:42.915 --> 24:46.118
Beautiful sister was
right about Mother.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.120
She didn't really love me.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.956
So I tell her
to leave.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.792
Mother is banished
from hotel forever!

24:52.825 --> 24:55.528
(sighs)
Well...

24:55.562 --> 24:58.965
that's exactly what she deserves
after what she did to you.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.569
Yes. So now I will be
wanting to learn from you.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.303
Huh?
I know nothing

25:04.336 --> 25:05.705
about ruling a hotel.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.040
"Running," not "ruling."
Yes.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.610
I-I found this little
show on the Internet.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.546
All about rulers. And
they all be wanting to sit

25:13.580 --> 25:15.214
on this funny-looking
iron throne...

25:15.247 --> 25:16.616
You mentioned wanting
to learn from me?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.050
Yes.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.719
Will you teach me?

25:19.752 --> 25:22.254
So I can use my shares wisely.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.629
Let's do it!

25:31.731 --> 25:32.699
ROGELIO:
Don't touch me.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.602
You don't want to catch
this sickness, trust me.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.804
I don't know
how Matelio survived it.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.639
(alarm rings)
Oh.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.841
It's my reminder
to apologize to Xo.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.845
I've been texting her an apology
every hour, on the hour.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.714
Can you hand me my phone?

25:47.747 --> 25:50.917
Actually, I think
I'm too weak to type.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.752
Can you do it for me?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.821
I think you can skip
an hour, Rogelio.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.623
And for what it's worth,

25:56.656 --> 25:59.626
I think Xo should be the
one apologizing to you.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.993
Come again?

26:01.027 --> 26:02.729
When things got tough,
she ran away,

26:02.762 --> 26:03.462
and that's not okay.

26:03.495 --> 26:06.098
You guys are
husband and wife.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.000
You got to stick it out
and work together.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.102
That's actually smart.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.039
I-I'm feverish.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.041
I didn't mean it that way.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.676
Can you tuck me in
a little tighter?

26:16.709 --> 26:19.912
I've been thinking
a lot about why

26:19.946 --> 26:22.615
we aren't as close
as we could be.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.684
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They look pretty close to me.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.687
You were a ladies' man
when we met.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.622
And you broke
my daughter's heart.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.790
That was a long time ago.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.659
And Jane and I are not together.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.660
I know.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.194
But seeing how close you are...

26:35.227 --> 26:37.196
You are going on a book tour.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.666
This is huge.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.635
(horn honks)

26:42.669 --> 26:43.770
ROGELIO:
Sometimes,

26:43.803 --> 26:45.404
it just seems
like a matter of time.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.775
Which is silly,
I know.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.746
Hi.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.715
I-I wasn't expecting you.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.751
I know. Uh...

26:59.752 --> 27:01.988
But I read this.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.756
My book?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.693
How did you...

27:08.227 --> 27:11.197
I understand why
you are writing it.

27:11.230 --> 27:15.201
It's your way of grieving
Michael and honoring his memory.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.670
So...

27:17.704 --> 27:19.872
you have my blessing
to continue.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.340
Really?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.342
I think you're gonna make
Michael very proud.

27:23.375 --> 27:27.213
But you and I need
space from each other.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.683
So I do not need
to hear from you

27:30.717 --> 27:32.785
or hear about the book.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.896
You stole my pages out
of the trash

27:43.930 --> 27:46.699
and showed them
to Patricia?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.768
Thank you.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.770
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends, this was

27:50.803 --> 27:52.939
the second time
Jane needed a push.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.341
I want you
to finish the book, okay?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.343
Because I really like
that Rake character,

27:57.376 --> 27:58.911
and I want to find out
what happens to him.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.080
How did I get so lucky

28:01.113 --> 28:04.416
to have you as my accidental
artificial inseminator?

28:04.450 --> 28:07.019
No, I'm the lucky one.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.455
(sniffling)

28:15.461 --> 28:18.865
Looks like someone has Jane
on the brain.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.767
(whoops)
Yeah!

28:20.800 --> 28:22.802
(cackling)
(whooping)

28:22.835 --> 28:24.837
Wait, wait, let me
have your phone.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.139
I want to take a picture.
We have to document this,

28:27.173 --> 28:28.741
because, clearly,
we are so drunk,

28:28.775 --> 28:30.042
we're not gonna remember this
in the morning.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.478
All right! Come on! Let
me see what you real...

28:32.511 --> 28:34.013
(chuckles)

28:35.882 --> 28:37.850
* Bright light fever.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.352
*

28:45.357 --> 28:48.260
Mateo was sick
and you guys hid it from me?
He was okay,

28:48.294 --> 28:50.362
and it was
your book tour.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.597
Mateo is
much more important, Ma.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.366
Of course he is, and Rafael
was taking him to the doctor.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.936
Which I need to know,
because I am his mother.

28:56.969 --> 29:00.406
I don't understand why you
would ever hide that from me.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.143
What's going on?

29:08.547 --> 29:11.250
And, of course,
we understand why,

29:11.283 --> 29:12.919
given what happened
with Michael.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.021
That's absurd.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.488
I don't overreact.

29:16.522 --> 29:20.426
I react the way any mother would
if her child is sick.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.396
Does Rafael feel
the same way, too?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.999
You should talk to Rafael
about all of this.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.201
Oh, believe me,
I will talk to him.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.503
Slow down, Jane.
No, I will not slow down.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.073
Mateo's my child. I need to know
what's going on with him,

29:34.106 --> 29:36.442
especially in regards to health.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.409
And, yes,
I may be overly sensitive

29:37.443 --> 29:38.510
to illness because of Michael,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.913
but you do not need
to protect me.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.348
I wasn't protecting you.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.850
I was protecting Mateo.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.251
What?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.518
(sighs)

29:46.552 --> 29:48.888
Do you remember
the first time you went away?

29:48.921 --> 29:52.224
And Mateo got sick
and then we drove to see you.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.493
(water running)
Whoa, come here.
(chuckles): Whoa.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.362
Hey!
Come here.

29:56.395 --> 30:00.032
Okay. Well, it looks like
you're feeling better.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.134
Can we ask Mom to be sure?

30:02.168 --> 30:04.136
Well, Mommy's in the shower.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.537
How do you feel?

30:05.571 --> 30:08.607
I think okay.
We should ask Mommy.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.509
Wh-Why do you want to ask Mommy?

30:10.542 --> 30:14.213
Because I could catch a germ
and die like Michael.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.448
Does that scare you?

30:17.616 --> 30:21.053
Okay. Look at me, all right?

30:21.087 --> 30:23.055
You're not gonna die.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.091
Okay? And you know
something else?

30:25.124 --> 30:26.292
You're strong,

30:26.325 --> 30:28.260
like a lion.

30:28.294 --> 30:32.264
I just didn't want him to be
afraid every time he got sick.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.500
I can't believe
I did that to him.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.069
I'm sorry.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.504
No, stop.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.006
It's not your fault
you're scared.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.107
And it's not your fault

30:41.140 --> 30:42.975
that Michael didn't go
to the doctor.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.413
Thank you for saying that.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.415
You okay?

30:49.448 --> 30:50.449
Yeah.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.251
I'll talk to you later.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.486
(shuddering breaths)

30:54.520 --> 30:55.922
(phone chimes)

30:55.955 --> 30:58.324
(sniffles)

31:01.460 --> 31:03.462
(sniffles)

31:18.710 --> 31:21.013
What's this?
BELLBOY: Special delivery.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.649
Do you want me
to make up the swans?

31:23.682 --> 31:24.883
No!
No!
No!

31:29.255 --> 31:30.456
He's got to stop
already.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.926
I'm texting him.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.068
He says they're
not from him.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.971
(laughing):
He's mad at me
for running away.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.409
All these years, he...

31:58.617 --> 32:00.219
(scoffs)
You should talk.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.653
You ran away from Jorge.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.459
Oh...
Hmm?

32:07.493 --> 32:08.660
Abuela.

32:08.694 --> 32:09.695
¿Qué?

32:19.671 --> 32:22.008
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, love.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.644
Don't you cry.
I'm not.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.079
I'm not gonna cry.
Because we're 30 minutes

32:27.113 --> 32:28.380
from the Romance
Writers Convention,

32:28.414 --> 32:29.982
which is going to
be livestreamed

32:30.016 --> 32:31.683
to hundreds of fans.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.252
I know.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.722
Abuela, remind me again,
why Adam was so terrible for me.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.692
What?
Ma!

33:04.083 --> 33:06.085
JANE:
And so,

33:06.118 --> 33:09.621
yeah, with all the lusty faces
I make while I'm writing,

33:09.655 --> 33:12.024
I can't, uh, write
in a coffee shop anymore.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.459
(laughter)

33:13.492 --> 33:15.094
Yeah.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.695
I saw your meltdown
on stage with Iyanla.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.665
It was trending on Twitter
for a few minutes.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.600
Oh, good.
(chuckles)

33:21.633 --> 33:23.369
Can you talk more
about that?

33:23.402 --> 33:24.770
Hmm?
Like,

33:24.803 --> 33:26.805
wh-what's it like to write
romance through heartbreak?

33:26.838 --> 33:28.574
Are you gonna write
about the cover artist

33:28.607 --> 33:29.608
in your next book?

33:37.683 --> 33:40.486
Well, that is
a two-part question.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.289
First, romance
through heartbreak.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.656
I mean, heartbreak
is a great place to start

33:44.690 --> 33:46.592
for a character, right? Uh...

33:46.625 --> 33:49.161
not looking for love,
suddenly it happens.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.796
Suddenly feelings
you thought were gone

33:50.829 --> 33:53.765
are now awakened.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.568
As for whether he'll be in
the next book, specifically?

33:56.602 --> 33:58.537
Every story needs
a villain, right?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.339
Go, Mommy!
Oh, she's nailing it.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.242
That's my girl. Now
bring it home, Jane.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.776
WOMAN:
So, what now?

34:04.810 --> 34:07.146
Are you opening the door
to love again?

34:07.179 --> 34:08.680
JANE:
Personally?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.549
I wouldn't go that far.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.451
But...

34:12.484 --> 34:13.719
maybe a window.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.687
(Jane chuckles)
(applause)

34:15.721 --> 34:17.623
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True,
there were only eight people

34:17.656 --> 34:18.857
in the audience,

34:18.890 --> 34:20.659
but damned if she didn't charm

34:20.692 --> 34:22.428
the entire octet.

34:22.461 --> 34:25.097
(applause)

34:25.131 --> 34:27.133
Thank you so much for coming.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.134
(chuckles)

34:28.167 --> 34:29.768
(inhales)

34:29.801 --> 34:31.803
Ooh. Who should
I make this out to?

34:31.837 --> 34:33.205
Patricia.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.613
Sorry. Hi, I, uh...

34:41.647 --> 34:42.648
I didn't know
that you were coming.

34:42.681 --> 34:46.385
Well, um, I kept track of you.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.586
A little.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.887
And when

34:48.920 --> 34:50.556
the book came out, I-I got it,

34:50.589 --> 34:53.792
and... and I read it.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.762
And I felt Michael again.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.264
And I didn't think

34:58.297 --> 35:00.799
I would ever feel him again.

35:00.832 --> 35:04.470
He would have
loved this.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.206
I love it.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.840
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

35:08.874 --> 35:11.810
this was the only review
that really mattered.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.213
Thank you so much.

35:14.246 --> 35:15.281
That means

35:15.314 --> 35:17.183
everything.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.551
I'm sorry that I said
those things to you.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.786
What happened,

35:20.819 --> 35:22.621
I know, was not your fault.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.890
He was a grown man.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.525
He should have gone
to the doctor.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.228
It's just...

35:29.261 --> 35:32.298
You can't get mad at the person
who died, you know?

35:32.331 --> 35:34.733
Yeah, I know.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.638
(exhales)

35:39.671 --> 35:41.407
(quietly):
Will you sign my book?

35:41.440 --> 35:44.176
Oh-- yeah!
(both laugh)

35:44.210 --> 35:46.212
(Xiomara sighing)

35:48.214 --> 35:49.215
What?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.890
You-- you what?!
What? Mom!
(laughs)

36:06.798 --> 36:08.400
(shouts)

36:08.434 --> 36:09.435
(laughing):
Yeah!

36:09.468 --> 36:12.671
Can we finally take this
top down and celebrate?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.273
*

36:14.306 --> 36:17.576
(laughing, whooping)

36:17.609 --> 36:18.810
Yes!

36:25.617 --> 36:28.354
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup. Back to real life.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.425
I'm sorry.

36:33.459 --> 36:34.960
You were right.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.962
I-I shouldn't have run away.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.864
I obviously have
a lot of work to do

36:38.897 --> 36:40.366
on being a married woman.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.301
I'm still figuring it out.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.270
And I'm sorry for who I was.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.004
For my failings.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.973
But I've changed.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.376
Yeah. I know.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.312
But there's still a lot
to talk about, you know.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.546
So I've been
thinking,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.782
I want to go to counseling.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.784
That's a great idea.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.319
You should go.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.720
Not me, us.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.455
We should go
to couples therapy together.

37:03.489 --> 37:07.359
(laughs)

37:07.393 --> 37:10.429
No way. I don't believe
in that garbage.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.566
But if you need me
to go with you,

37:14.600 --> 37:16.568
while they
figure out

37:16.602 --> 37:20.539
your issues,
I'm happy to do that.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.940
(exhales)

37:21.973 --> 37:23.375
Fine.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.411
Let's do that, then.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.451
Thank you.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.309
(exhales)

38:01.813 --> 38:03.782
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,

38:03.815 --> 38:06.685
Alba knew the only answer
she could give was...

38:06.718 --> 38:08.019
No.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.355
What?

38:12.023 --> 38:15.694
Well, I guess that window
is officially closed.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.497
Hello, beautiful sister.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.432
Okay, first lesson.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.502
Future lessons will take place
in my office from now on.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.872
No. They won't.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.676
What's going on?

38:30.709 --> 38:32.411
Well, for one,

38:32.444 --> 38:34.446
I finally finished
watching Game of Thrones,

38:34.480 --> 38:36.382
and spoiler alert,

38:36.415 --> 38:39.351
turns out Sansa
becomes very powerful.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.552
What are you talking about?

38:40.586 --> 38:44.756
Beautiful sister thinks
I am stupid donkey.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.392
But I figure out truth.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.427
You have been
whispering lies to me

38:48.460 --> 38:50.429
this whole time.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.063
You don't care about me.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.465
Hi, Mommy.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.467
Hi, girls.
(gasps)

38:55.501 --> 38:56.968
Do you miss your Auntie Anezka?

38:57.002 --> 38:59.705
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To clarify...

38:59.738 --> 39:01.440
Not really. We hate her, right?

39:02.841 --> 39:05.444
But Mommy was crying
at her funeral.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.713
After we sprayed perfume
in your eyes?

39:09.014 --> 39:11.049
You know what I learn
from my own funeral?

39:11.082 --> 39:14.786
That I am all alone
in this world.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.821
And now
that I know,

39:15.854 --> 39:19.658
I will rule things my way.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.660
Look, Anezka.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.495
You're right.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.896
I don't trust you.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.131
But guess what.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.332
It doesn't matter.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.735
Because once I tell Luisa
that you and Mother gaslit her,

39:29.768 --> 39:32.638
she's going to get out and sign
all her shares over to Rafael.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.573
I told her.
What?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.508
I told her.
Only, not that version.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.544
The version I tell her

39:38.577 --> 39:41.747
is that you and Rafael were the
ones who had been sending Carl

39:41.780 --> 39:43.582
and lighting her gas.

39:43.615 --> 39:44.850
That's a lie.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.051
(laughs)
Yes.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.520
Well, Luisa be not knowing that.

39:48.554 --> 39:53.391
And she seemed very,
very angry with her brother.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.528
What the hell, man?
Apparently,

39:56.562 --> 39:58.464
she really didn't
order the casket.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.566
Oh!

40:00.599 --> 40:03.068
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And I promise you, friends,

40:03.101 --> 40:05.837
this time she really is dead.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.839
Ned Stark dead.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.841
JANE:
To be continued.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.511
Please, just read
for five more minutes.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.879
Mm, nope.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.881
It's time for bed.

40:18.484 --> 40:19.685
Good night, Mr. Sweetface.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.052
I'm a lion.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.521
Right, Daddy?

40:22.554 --> 40:24.956
Yes, but that's our secret,
remember?

40:27.626 --> 40:30.462
What was all that
lion stuff about?

40:30.496 --> 40:32.464
Eh, it was a father-son thing.

40:32.498 --> 40:35.501
See? I knew you'd get there.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.605
We make a really good team.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.143
It's getting late.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.614
(laughs softly)

40:50.782 --> 40:51.950
(water running)

40:51.983 --> 40:53.585
(water stops)

40:53.619 --> 40:55.554
Mateo seems fine.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.223
Thank you, a-again,
for not calling me.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.157
What's wrong?

40:59.190 --> 41:00.659
The review.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.494
Maybe I'm not cut out
to be a writer.

41:02.528 --> 41:04.496
That is just your doubts
and your fears talking.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.598
You have to
keep writing.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.600
You are a writer.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.835
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.604
This was the third time.

41:12.638 --> 41:13.705
You need me to say it?

41:18.544 --> 41:19.978
Be brave.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.680
Be brave.

41:21.713 --> 41:22.848
Be brave.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.255
And, friends,
he knew then and there,

41:30.288 --> 41:33.659
that he had to be brave, too.
