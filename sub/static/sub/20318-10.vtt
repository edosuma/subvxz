00:08.957 --> 00:10.972
She is good, right? 

00:12.268 --> 00:14.192
There is nothing wrong. 

00:14.227 --> 00:16.277
She is amazing. 

00:16.312 --> 00:18.198
It is not to say so. 

00:18.199 --> 00:21.105
My wife. 
It is even better. Want to see? 

00:21.667 --> 00:25.053
- Just kidding. 
- He is funny. As Osman. 

00:25.088 --> 00:27.473
Funny. 
He is funny. 

00:28.431 --> 00:30.849
Enjoy the dessert. 

00:30.884 --> 00:33.095
Thanks. I can not stand 
eat anything. 

00:33.130 --> 00:34.821
On the house. 

00:34.822 --> 00:36.722
- Thanks. 
- Special delivery. 

00:36.744 --> 00:39.533
The food is amazing. 

00:39.568 --> 00:42.925
Thank you very much. My mother 
is a fantastic cook. 

00:42.960 --> 00:44.681
It was she who had 
a restaurant? 

00:44.682 --> 00:46.247
Actually it was my father. 
When I was a child, 

00:46.248 --> 00:48.499
he worked 
as a mechanic and at night, 

00:48.534 --> 00:50.281
directed the taxi to my uncle. 

00:50.282 --> 00:53.574
My uncle became very angry 
when discovered. 

00:53.609 --> 00:57.480
And when I was 12 years old 
he opened the place. Enjoy. 

00:57.515 --> 00:59.276
- No, stay with us. 
- Hey. 

00:59.277 --> 01:01.262
I have to go back 
to the kitchen. 

01:04.030 --> 01:07.103
Released employees, we 
just me and my mother back. 

01:07.138 --> 01:09.320
I mean then 
did you do that? 

01:09.355 --> 01:11.824
Basically it is, I 
working here now. 

01:11.859 --> 01:13.364
When I 
the ambulance. 

01:13.365 --> 01:15.603
Oz, if you continue with this, 
will need an ambulance. 

01:15.638 --> 01:17.337
Tell them that believe 
that Toby and I will be 

01:17.338 --> 01:18.865
driving all day, 
are mistaken. 

01:18.866 --> 01:21.853
It is what we do. 
What? 

01:21.888 --> 01:23.757
Business go wrong. 

01:23.758 --> 01:28.854
In this recession, no one leaves 
for a typical Turkish dinner. 

01:28.855 --> 01:31.425
They have a loan to pay 
and are a little late. 

01:31.460 --> 01:32.949
- A little is not bad. 
- Four payments. 

01:32.950 --> 01:34.412
Okay, this is bad. 

01:34.413 --> 01:36.345
They have 14 days to 
packed $ 100 thousand, 

01:36.380 --> 01:38.980
or lose the house and the business 
and are on the street. 

01:39.010 --> 01:41.892
Or worse, the same with me. 

01:41.928 --> 01:43.466
There must be a way 
to get more money. 

01:43.467 --> 01:47.099
Have tried everything. 
Banks, relatives, other banks. 

01:47.134 --> 01:49.840
- Times are tough. 
- Do you have any idea? 

01:49.875 --> 01:53.985
I? Money? No, 
you are paying for the dinner. 

01:54.545 --> 01:58.314
Toby, that's it. Telepathy. 
This should give some money. 

01:58.349 --> 02:01.342
I can not. 

02:01.377 --> 02:05.912
- You can not what? 
- Wait for your "Baklava". 

02:05.947 --> 02:09.184
Olivia, already told you 
about Toby? 

02:09.801 --> 02:11.349
Passed the limits. 

02:11.350 --> 02:14.107
You are right. 
But I am desperate. 

02:14.142 --> 02:15.594
Desperate? 

02:15.595 --> 02:18.464
Try one of these.

You are already a foot in the bag

Therefore it is of interest 
use your gift for me. 

03:04.165 --> 03:06.610
My gift is useless 
for money. 

03:06.645 --> 03:08.635
Believe me, I tried 
when I was younger.

The only thing guaranteed

03:14.127 --> 03:16.471
- Not bad, huh? 
- We will profit from it. 

03:16.506 --> 03:18.032
Oz, I know I will 
continue with that. 

03:18.033 --> 03:19.433
Not thought about it. 

03:19.434 --> 03:22.438
I'm not reading your mind. 
I know how you think. 

03:22.488 --> 03:25.194
I said, 
but you do. 

03:25.229 --> 03:27.356
I will not cheat at poker.

is against the rules? 

03:29.130 --> 03:31.532
I. In any case, 
I have no money to bet. 

03:31.567 --> 03:34.502
- I got 400 bucks. 
- No help robbing someone. 

03:34.537 --> 03:36.687
You play against the casino, 
steals a corporation. 

03:36.722 --> 03:40.120
The owners are pension plans 
for guys like you and me. 

03:40.852 --> 03:43.498
And if you play against guys 
different from you and me? 

03:43.499 --> 03:44.900

03:54.597 --> 03:56.424
Won five hands followed 
last week. 

03:56.425 --> 03:58.408

Awesome.

Do a good job.

Listen, just between us. 
What his problem? 

04:44.565 --> 04:47.883
He has no problem, 

04:47.884 --> 04:51.202
just a lot of energy, you know. 

04:51.237 --> 04:53.937
No, talk of recent weeks,

04:53.938 --> 04:56.947

or quit? 

05:40.955 --> 05:44.855
He has a high Flush, 
I will stop these guys. 

05:47.770 --> 05:50.880
Fullhouse, kings and aces. 

05:52.709 --> 05:56.787
Fullhouse, aces and kings. 
I can not lose with that. 

05:59.245 --> 06:00.745
How are you? 

06:04.167 --> 06:05.667
2 thousand and five hundred. 

06:08.040 --> 06:09.740
I bet everything. 

06:10.988 --> 06:15.188
Ignore eyes, check 
the shoulders, hands, breathing. 

06:16.979 --> 06:18.829
He is bluffing. 

06:18.864 --> 06:20.564
Okay, I bet everything. 

06:23.576 --> 06:25.276
This is too much for me.

Guys, enjoy yourselves.

07:04.472 --> 07:07.575
Had $ 10 thousand and lost? 

07:07.610 --> 07:09.360
I could not predict, 
okay? 

07:09.395 --> 07:11.505
Was reading his mind 
and he also was surprised. 

07:11.540 --> 07:13.915
That money was for my 
family. It was not just a game. 

07:13.950 --> 07:15.897
- You know my 400 bucks? 
- I will return you. 

07:15.932 --> 07:18.382
Vai me back, baby. 
And we were right. 

07:18.417 --> 07:20.887
It should be quiet as you. 
I am exaggerating, right? 

07:20.922 --> 07:22.672
Because we have a plan B, right? 

07:22.707 --> 07:25.137
Guessing the weight of people? 
"Come again! 

07:25.172 --> 07:27.779
$ 30 mil. 
Know your weight. " 

07:31.097 --> 07:32.837
Hey, Liv. Liv. 

07:32.838 --> 07:34.752
- You are looking for Oz? 
- Actually, looking for you. 

07:34.787 --> 07:37.287
He is here, 
I heard earlier today on the radio 

07:37.322 --> 07:39.472
that will give a reward 
of $ 100 thousand. 

07:39.507 --> 07:41.857
for those who find the 
remains of a dead. 

07:41.892 --> 07:44.442
- And this is Oz. 
- Here she is. 

07:44.477 --> 07:47.133
Things like the detective, 
right? I thought like that. 

07:47.168 --> 07:50.131
U.S. $ 100 thousand for 
a person dead? 

07:50.166 --> 07:53.437
Yeah, she was dead for nine months, 
by her husband. He was convicted. 

07:53.438 --> 07:54.838
Gotta go. 

07:54.840 --> 07:56.658
I'll call you later. 
Vai answer? 

07:56.693 --> 08:00.088
- Yes. 
- Thanks, Liv. 

08:01.601 --> 08:03.348
Who is offering 
the money? 

08:03.349 --> 08:04.752
The husband. 

08:04.753 --> 08:08.253
He was sentenced by death, 
know where the body is. 

08:09.068 --> 08:10.568
Weird. 

08:11.628 --> 08:14.228
It is because of the appeal, Toby. 
He thinks it looks innocent, 

08:14.263 --> 08:16.256
OJ looked like 
by real killers. 

08:16.291 --> 08:18.932
Therefore find a body 
and prove that he killed her. 

08:18.967 --> 08:20.910
Without the body, 
he may call, right? 

08:20.945 --> 08:23.945
Look, sorry for the family 
of Oz, feel it, 

08:23.980 --> 08:25.630
I can not give 
this information ... 

08:25.665 --> 08:27.765
Let me see 
the file, Charlie. 

08:30.357 --> 08:33.217
The detective who solved 
the case is a great friend. 

08:33.251 --> 08:36.251
Okay, I will not 
nonsense, I promise. 

08:39.255 --> 08:42.150
Arthur Stebbes, 62, carpenter, 
studied up to 8th grade. 

08:42.186 --> 08:43.784
How to become a millionaire? 

08:43.785 --> 08:46.036
Be helped cruel. Katie was 
the third wife of Arthur, 

08:46.071 --> 08:48.571
- Had 28 years e. .. 
- Bonita, saw the photo. 

08:48.606 --> 08:50.856
Arthur seemed very jealous, 
because three months before 

08:50.891 --> 08:54.891
Katie from disappearing, he made a 
insurance of $ 5 million for himself. 

08:57.367 --> 08:59.453
- And for Katie. 
- I do not know, that ... 

08:59.463 --> 09:02.328
- The jury thought. 
- Nothing else showing? 

09:02.363 --> 09:04.363
There was no invasion, neighbors 
heard a man and a woman 

09:04.398 --> 09:07.080
screaming inside. 
Some moments later, shots. 

09:07.081 --> 09:09.910
It was so arrogant that 
thought escape. 

09:13.155 --> 09:15.274
I saw what you mean. 

09:15.812 --> 09:18.012
- I regret it, Charlie. 
- Better not! 

09:25.579 --> 09:27.977
Thank you. 

09:37.578 --> 09:39.778
Mr. Stebbes, I 
two hours to come here. 

09:39.813 --> 09:42.301
I am very concerned 
in your case. 

09:42.336 --> 09:44.500
I think I can 
find the body. 

09:44.535 --> 09:47.480
How? 
And mental? 

09:47.515 --> 09:49.415
Because yesterday was 
a woman here, 

09:49.450 --> 09:52.100
wanting to look for Katie 
with a wand rabdomântica. 

09:52.135 --> 09:55.835
Placed a reward, that 
will happen. What to expect? 

09:55.870 --> 09:59.350
Expected to appear 
someone who knows something. 

09:59.706 --> 10:03.816
Not an ex-girlfriend's 
killer. Mother .. 

10:03.976 --> 10:07.057
Well, anyone who saw 
something. 

10:07.413 --> 10:10.029
Do not expect someone who 
was wasting my time. 

10:10.159 --> 10:13.254
Well, it has long 
to waste. 

10:13.398 --> 10:15.637
25 years, is not it? 

10:15.777 --> 10:19.242
So, let's talk 
and see what happens. 

10:23.532 --> 10:25.272
Was in the West Coast 
the business. 

10:25.273 --> 10:27.199
Took the flight 
nocturnal home. 

10:28.117 --> 10:31.017
Came home 
about 08h in the morning. 

10:31.052 --> 10:33.052
I had coffee and 
I was wondering ... 

10:33.087 --> 10:34.787
that Katie still asleep? 

10:36.559 --> 10:38.259
Then went up. 

10:39.703 --> 10:43.403
He had blood on sheets, 
feathers everywhere. 

10:46.143 --> 10:47.743
I called the police. 

10:49.988 --> 10:54.388
They found fresh ground 
and a shovel in my garage, 

10:55.252 --> 10:59.752
found drops of blood it 
in the trunk of my Porsche. 

11:00.719 --> 11:04.719
And found a bullet in the bed. 
Same size of my gun. 

11:04.754 --> 11:06.985
Which never found. 

11:07.020 --> 11:08.720
The prosecution argued 
who came home, 

11:08.755 --> 11:10.962
killed his wife, dig 
money, buried it, 

11:10.963 --> 11:14.530
returned home, took coffee 
and called 911. 

11:14.565 --> 11:17.315
The argument is one 
I was a moron. 

11:17.350 --> 11:20.050
Why must be a, 
to leave so many clues. 

11:20.702 --> 11:23.352
And the jury believed, 
because they were assholes. 

11:24.536 --> 11:26.814
His defense? 

11:31.140 --> 11:33.140
Katie loved. 

11:34.187 --> 11:35.999
In brigávamos. Yes 

11:36.123 --> 11:38.824
It was the perfect husband? No. 

11:38.988 --> 11:42.088
But then 
it was not the perfect wife. 

11:43.129 --> 11:47.213
I can tell you this, 
everything I did, 

11:47.342 --> 11:49.742
made by Katie and Tyler. 

11:50.931 --> 11:52.675
Tyler was his son? 

11:52.810 --> 11:56.452
Yes, first marriage. 

11:56.600 --> 11:58.400
He was close to Katie? 

11:59.699 --> 12:02.949
Well, yes, 
can say that. 

12:04.205 --> 12:06.355
You are near him? 

12:06.390 --> 12:08.840
This has nothing 
to do with Tyler. 

12:08.875 --> 12:11.259
His defense says 
which was frame. 

12:11.260 --> 12:12.660
Yes 

12:12.661 --> 12:15.155
He made some enemies 
the path. 

12:16.362 --> 12:19.812
Why kill your wife? 
Why not kill you? 

12:22.035 --> 12:24.585
If someone hates you, kills you. 

12:24.620 --> 12:29.220
If you despise, 
kill someone you love. 

12:30.804 --> 12:32.554
As well, do not know 
where is the body? 

12:32.589 --> 12:34.658
Do not get a reading. 

12:34.814 --> 12:36.624
So someone must have 
moved the body to him. 

12:36.762 --> 12:38.679
Or he does not know anything 
about the murder. 

12:38.819 --> 12:40.865
Toby, please 
not say so, come on. 

12:40.993 --> 12:44.780
It may have many 
enemies, I do not know where to start. 

12:44.909 --> 12:47.336
How to find the body? 

12:47.466 --> 12:49.869
We can talk to your child, 
is a good place to start. 

12:50.003 --> 12:52.373
Look at that, my parents are 
calling me for that. 

12:52.522 --> 12:54.097
My mother is so hopeful 
that seems crazy, 

12:54.141 --> 12:57.034
my father is so negative that 
only with the urge to strangle him. 

12:57.174 --> 12:59.442
It should be. 

12:59.653 --> 13:01.153
Whether I answer? 

13:02.526 --> 13:03.926
Hello? 

13:04.560 --> 13:05.960
Yes 

13:06.723 --> 13:08.223
Yes, why? 

13:09.233 --> 13:10.733
What? 

13:12.563 --> 13:15.563
My father had a heart attack. 
Mom, we are going. 

13:30.006 --> 13:32.138
- What to talk? 
- I do not know. 

13:32.282 --> 13:34.690
He will be okay. 
It was a panic attack. 

13:34.814 --> 13:37.424
- Panic attack? 
- Yes, that's good. 

13:37.562 --> 13:40.623
Yeah, okay. Rapid heart, 
discomfort, dizziness, chest pain, 

13:40.658 --> 13:43.058
all the symptoms may 
indicate a heart problem, 

13:43.093 --> 13:45.654
but the tests showed 
that the heart is normal. 

13:45.689 --> 13:48.456
This is something that 
my Demir is not normal. 

13:48.575 --> 13:51.099
Well, it is a lovely man 
and is ready to go home. 

13:51.222 --> 13:53.001
Just make sure 
to remain calm. 

13:53.131 --> 13:55.244
You hear that, Mom? 
Calm. Right? 

13:55.279 --> 13:57.879
- You can do this? 
- Demir! 

14:02.618 --> 14:05.767
Come here, I met 
two paramedics. 

14:05.802 --> 14:09.013
The stories that told me 
about you ... 

14:09.680 --> 14:12.222
Any way to stop the 
here for another few weeks? 

14:12.258 --> 14:13.658
No. 

14:21.210 --> 14:23.152
Agreed to see him 
because my father asked, 

14:23.187 --> 14:25.337
I do not know what to say, 
tried everything, 

14:25.372 --> 14:27.365
the best lawyers 
and private detectives. 

14:27.400 --> 14:30.550
- Thank you for receiving us. 
- Sure. 

14:30.551 --> 14:31.951
I was in Boston 
when it? 

14:31.970 --> 14:34.070
Yes, Master in Law 
at Harvard. 

14:34.105 --> 14:37.813
But must say I learned more 
trial than in the course. 

14:37.848 --> 14:39.531
It? 
How so? 

14:39.686 --> 14:42.184
Murder and trial. 
Two different realities. 

14:42.338 --> 14:44.238
Clearly, armed 
for my father. 

14:45.390 --> 14:48.090
Listen, Bartolo, 
watch it. 

14:50.695 --> 14:52.515
Think the jury was wrong? 

14:52.667 --> 14:54.287
Yes 

14:54.312 --> 15:00.142
Look, Katie was beautiful, 
charming, sexy. 

15:02.225 --> 15:04.532
The accusation turned everything 
on a novel. 

15:04.680 --> 15:06.442
You and she were coming? 

15:06.478 --> 15:07.878
Actually, no. 

15:13.219 --> 15:15.219
His father is jealous? 

15:16.637 --> 15:19.437
- Yes 
- Katie had a case? 

15:20.087 --> 15:22.332
- I know of one. 
- Arthur knew? 

15:22.333 --> 15:23.733
Yes 

15:24.344 --> 15:25.900
My father is divorcing 
other two wives, 

15:25.901 --> 15:27.301
because it has no 
is the third divorce. 

15:27.302 --> 15:29.184
Perhaps become tired 
to lose half the money. 

15:29.219 --> 15:30.719
Tired of speaking? 

15:32.030 --> 15:34.596
- Okay, thanks. 
- No problem, good luck. 

15:43.887 --> 15:45.807
Okay, listen, I have 
the surname of the man, 

15:45.842 --> 15:48.492
but I want 
Bartolo check. 

15:48.527 --> 15:50.715
- Have a picture of this guy? 
- Yes, the vi ... 

15:50.862 --> 15:52.857
Some 40 years, Latin. 

15:52.892 --> 15:54.392
Oz, in fact, 
think it was her son. 

15:54.427 --> 15:56.315
He thinks now? 

15:56.316 --> 15:57.716
Okay, these are all 
registered in the system, 

15:57.717 --> 16:00.608
first or last name Bartolo. 
Recognize any of them? 

16:02.047 --> 16:04.395
This guy, right here. 

16:04.558 --> 16:07.963
Bartolo Cortazar, 
came from Argentina. 

16:08.009 --> 16:09.443
It is the security? 

16:09.482 --> 16:12.880
No, is vice president 
Construction of Stebbes. 

16:13.046 --> 16:16.930
- You are kidding. 
- Convicted of assault in 84, 

16:17.087 --> 16:19.446
since 
was charged 5 times. 

16:19.599 --> 16:23.161
Conspiracy, arson, assault, 
fraud and obstruction. 

16:23.310 --> 16:25.310
Was considered innocent 
at all times. 

16:32.990 --> 16:36.390
- How many races has with that? 
- I do not know, I expect. 

16:39.329 --> 16:45.229
One, two, three ... ten in 12h, 
must be a record. 

16:47.239 --> 16:49.776
Oz? 
It's Molly Sims? 

16:49.777 --> 16:51.177
No way! 

16:51.203 --> 16:53.262
- What? 
- Sleep, was dreaming. 

16:53.407 --> 16:55.731
Why not go home? 
Store the supplies, 

16:55.868 --> 16:58.180
- Then go with Bartolo. 
- I close it. 

16:58.215 --> 16:59.622
Okay. 

16:59.753 --> 17:01.370
The guy is the heavy, 
let me do the questions. 

17:01.374 --> 17:04.387
Okay, you're the cop. 
Okay, police. 

17:11.364 --> 17:13.138
Nice here, Toby. 

17:13.281 --> 17:15.481
Probably not find 
our bodies until spring. 

17:22.346 --> 17:24.818
How are you? We are here 
to find the Bartolo. 

17:24.964 --> 17:26.994
If it is getting? 
Thank you. 

17:27.133 --> 17:28.733
- You can call it for us? 
- Sure. 

17:31.144 --> 17:33.287
- Okay? 
- Okay. 

17:35.386 --> 17:37.416
Oz, Oz. 

17:37.566 --> 17:40.016
- Hi, how are you? Toby Logan. 
- Bartolo. 

17:40.051 --> 17:42.189
- Oz. 
- What can I do for you? 

17:42.224 --> 17:44.774
I think Arthur Stebbes 
spoke to. 

17:44.809 --> 17:47.059
Do not talk to Arthur, 
He leaves messages. 

17:47.094 --> 17:48.994
What happened 
between you two? 

17:49.029 --> 17:51.479
Arthur and I built 
the company. 

17:51.514 --> 17:53.646
And now the business 
are stopped, 

17:53.792 --> 17:57.180
because my partner 
is a convicted murderer. 

17:57.324 --> 17:59.300
Answer your question? 

17:59.432 --> 18:02.982
We know what you know 
on the murder of Katie. 

18:05.455 --> 18:07.555
I know who killed her. 

18:07.590 --> 18:10.154
Bury it and forget 
to cover up evidence. 

18:10.189 --> 18:12.939
There was a man of details. 

18:12.974 --> 18:15.829
They are insinuating that I know 
where he was buried? 

18:15.955 --> 18:17.638
- No. 
- No. 

18:17.769 --> 18:19.403
Well, because I do not know. 

18:19.543 --> 18:22.879
Got it. So has no idea 
of whom would have done it? 

18:23.037 --> 18:25.878
Who is involved with it 
this thing? 

18:28.322 --> 18:31.322
Do not know if Arthur was 
friend of a goalkeeper? 

18:32.940 --> 18:37.541
You know, you find the 
was very good, 

18:37.679 --> 18:40.049
but I have other things 
to do, then ... 

18:40.169 --> 18:42.820
- Yeah. 
- Thanks. 

18:44.649 --> 18:47.849
- Gary is a problem. 
- Thanks. 

18:50.986 --> 18:54.186
Idiots. 

18:55.034 --> 18:57.234
Gary? 
Bartolo. Call me. 

18:57.821 --> 18:59.221
How will the game 
the treasure, boys? 

18:59.256 --> 19:02.500
Do you know a guy named Gary, 
USA kills when it masks? 

19:02.639 --> 19:04.480
You are watching many 
films of terror, Toby. 

19:04.610 --> 19:06.490
I'm not. 
I have a hint of Bartolo, 

19:06.525 --> 19:08.755
the goalkeeper killing 
Katie the Stebbes. 

19:08.790 --> 19:10.856
He plays the Leafs 
or the Rangers? 

19:10.986 --> 19:12.413
Funny, 
very funny. 

19:12.560 --> 19:14.561
I can not help 
without a name. 

19:14.604 --> 19:16.009
Also, 
I have a guy in emergency 

19:16.151 --> 19:18.309
which claims to have thrown it 
even twice, in the back. 

19:18.332 --> 19:19.827
Gotta go. 

19:19.974 --> 19:21.853
Leafs or Rangers? Said 
he was a goalkeeper, right? 

19:21.877 --> 19:23.290
Maybe some. 

19:23.323 --> 19:25.073
So it was not a goalkeeper, 
Bartolo was? 

19:26.066 --> 19:28.977
- I was a goalkeeper. 
- Toby, I'm confused. 

19:29.139 --> 19:31.010
Oz, my gift is not perfect. 

19:31.181 --> 19:33.758
Read the mind of Bartolo, he sees 
a goalkeeper throwing it. 

19:33.914 --> 19:38.214
Or he is the goalkeeper who shot, 
or hire one for that. 

19:39.360 --> 19:41.760
- He hired a goalkeeper. 
- It's what I think. 

19:41.913 --> 19:44.834
So we need only find 
Gary called the goalkeeper. 

19:44.982 --> 19:48.760
- Any idea? 
- Yes, tons. 

19:48.894 --> 19:52.955
All right, Gary has a Vanbamo, 
Gary Rose and Gary Martin, 

19:52.988 --> 19:55.063
that was the Dallas goalkeeper. 
And is Gary Dembski, 

19:55.199 --> 19:58.199
Gary Clintero, these are 
guys "indies" that have websites. 

19:58.236 --> 19:59.649
What is this? 
What have you done? 

19:59.684 --> 20:01.184
Well, maybe this 
"Gary, the goalkeeper" 

20:01.219 --> 20:03.019
is one of those you call 
when playing hockey 

20:03.054 --> 20:04.854
and is not nobody 
to stay in the networks. 

20:04.889 --> 20:06.489
- "Rent a goalkeeper" 
- Yes 

20:06.524 --> 20:08.024
Have a better idea? 

20:08.988 --> 20:10.788
- No. 
- Okay, I call guys Pros 

20:10.823 --> 20:12.596
and say we want to see 
if they are good. 

20:12.717 --> 20:14.897
And say where and when. 
We olheiros, bro. 

20:14.932 --> 20:16.821
I do not know, he 
seems to us. 

20:16.960 --> 20:19.459
- No voice too? 
- No. 

20:19.604 --> 20:21.104
Okay, then read 
the minds of them. 

20:22.851 --> 20:26.077
Dad, look, your health 
is more important, right? 

20:26.218 --> 20:28.479
Mom and I take care 
the restaurant. 

20:28.514 --> 20:30.001
Yes 

20:30.054 --> 20:32.470
No, I will not let you 
get near the food. 

20:32.628 --> 20:35.163
Yes I love you too, Dad. 
Bye! 

20:35.278 --> 20:36.797
Let me near the food? 

20:36.965 --> 20:41.331
No, he has something 
with white people. 

20:41.484 --> 20:44.596
Not touch the food ... 
It's that guy? 

20:44.741 --> 20:47.188
Download the glass. 

20:47.435 --> 20:50.022
Hey, Gary? 
You "Gary, the goalkeeper? 

20:50.057 --> 20:51.878
- Yes 
- Oi. 

20:51.913 --> 20:53.413
Need a goalkeeper? 

20:53.984 --> 20:56.205
Hey, close the window! 
It is cold! 

20:56.338 --> 20:59.373
- Hi, how are you, Gary? 
- Looking for someone? 

21:20.611 --> 21:24.130
- No. Not him. 
- Are you sure? 

21:24.279 --> 21:28.281
Yes I told the address of Katie, 
he thought the girlfriend. 

21:28.435 --> 21:31.042
I asked the name of the skating, 
and he thought the girlfriend. 

21:31.196 --> 21:33.330
And pretended to have received a link 
a goalkeeper called Bartolo, 

21:33.365 --> 21:35.962
which could excite him, and he 
even thought the girlfriend.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.054
She believes, at least? 

21:38.203 --> 21:40.662
On his head was. 

21:40.800 --> 21:42.938
It means that expensive 
exaggerate the gostosura 

21:43.070 --> 21:44.831
of their girlfriends 
in your thoughts? 

21:44.978 --> 21:47.705
You are kidding, right? 
What man does that? 

21:47.853 --> 21:49.785
Just go out with attractive women, 
then it would say. 

21:49.813 --> 21:51.213
Okay, who is next? 

21:54.654 --> 21:56.954
You know, Toby, 
I think I was a child. 

21:56.989 --> 21:58.823
Just think, he would 
with all the money. 

21:58.970 --> 22:00.901
The only problem is that 
he was away, studying. 

22:01.055 --> 22:02.911
He is Gary Rose? 

22:02.953 --> 22:06.088
- Yes, it is the last of the list. 
- Okay. 

22:07.789 --> 22:09.219
Gary Rose? 

22:09.254 --> 22:10.929
- Who are you? 
- How will I Toby Logan. 

22:11.083 --> 22:13.750
Looking for a goalkeeper 
some games over the weekend. 

22:13.785 --> 22:15.710
55 end of time, more travel. 

22:15.711 --> 22:17.111
- Okay. 
- Where? 

22:17.112 --> 22:18.512
- Oakfield. 
- What skating? 

22:18.513 --> 22:21.490
Centennial Arena, 
St. Kevin Avenue, 48th 

22:29.167 --> 22:31.675
It seems that there lived a girl 
Missing call Katie. 

22:40.501 --> 22:43.414
Who are you? 
What are you talking about? 

22:43.549 --> 22:45.549
I am the man who seeks 
the goalkeeper killer. 

22:49.045 --> 22:52.845
Who are you? A lunatic? 
What the hell, get light! Easy! 

22:53.509 --> 22:55.444
Tell your friend that 
it gives me chills. 

22:55.450 --> 22:56.912
I can hear you. 

22:57.790 --> 22:59.190
Great. 

23:00.265 --> 23:01.704
Come on. 

23:01.705 --> 23:03.138
Do not wait for this. 

23:16.219 --> 23:19.219
- Hello, what's new? 
- Hello 

23:20.287 --> 23:22.627
The novelty is that the ribs 
are not broken. 

23:22.791 --> 23:24.291
Just a little injured. 

23:24.942 --> 23:28.822
Right here, however. Ali. 
Explain the last year and a half. 

23:28.948 --> 23:30.648
- Okay. 
- No heart. 

23:32.466 --> 23:35.731
Ai. 
No, there is a heart. 

23:35.872 --> 23:38.022
- No. 
- It hurts. 

23:38.171 --> 23:40.263
- Come on, come on. 
- No, look. 

23:40.417 --> 23:42.219
Doctor, come here, 
Give me your hands, please. 

23:42.358 --> 23:44.058
This, right here. 
Feel it. 

23:44.200 --> 23:45.718
Right here. 

23:45.864 --> 23:47.443
- It's a beat. 
- Maybe. 

23:47.574 --> 23:49.044
I think you 
have tachycardia. 

23:49.223 --> 23:51.421
What is this? It is ... 

23:51.574 --> 23:53.953
Accelerated heartbeat. 
Dangerous, no? 

23:54.092 --> 23:56.121
Can cause serious delusions. 

23:56.275 --> 23:58.218
I have delusions. 

23:58.345 --> 24:00.163
Have cure for this? 

24:00.309 --> 24:02.190
Maybe. 

24:02.341 --> 24:05.004
Through therapy osculatória. 

24:05.155 --> 24:07.649
What is it? I guess I forgot. 

24:07.824 --> 24:09.524
That's it. 

24:15.242 --> 24:18.759
Sorry for the problems 
your family's financial. 

24:19.104 --> 24:20.542
What kind of restaurant was? 

24:20.683 --> 24:22.139
- Turkish. 
- I knew it was Turkish. 

24:22.283 --> 24:27.210
Am. Good. Rather meat, 
cheese, farofa, pistachio. 

24:27.546 --> 24:29.676
Answering your question: 

24:29.714 --> 24:31.115
Probably the 
fastest way is 

24:31.237 --> 24:34.308
Take the lead S & P 
and have bullet in Russell. 

24:35.219 --> 24:37.790
I do not know what it is. 
Racing? 

24:37.825 --> 24:40.415
No. Stock Market. 
What kind of capital you have? 

24:40.545 --> 24:42.739
- Five. 
- Five hundred thousand? 

24:42.880 --> 24:44.716
- Five hundred dollars. 
- Five hundred dollars? 

24:44.860 --> 24:46.550
It was crazy? Toby, come here. 

24:46.686 --> 24:49.182
Knew his friend had 
size sense of humor? 

24:49.361 --> 24:51.824
Oz? No, sir. No way. 
He has no. 

24:51.886 --> 24:53.333
I'm trying to be 
really well with you. 

24:53.390 --> 24:56.316
- So, back to when active? 
- The doctor says tomorrow. 

24:56.481 --> 24:59.243
- So be careful. 
- Okay. 

24:59.390 --> 25:01.290
- Excuse me. 
- Oi. 

25:02.570 --> 25:04.079
It hurts? 

25:04.235 --> 25:06.169
Only when breathe. 

25:06.333 --> 25:07.833
Come on. 
I show you something. 

25:09.061 --> 25:12.246
Sorry not to have returned more 
early, and was a crazy night. 

25:12.405 --> 25:14.760
- Find Gary Rose? 
- More or less. 

25:14.887 --> 25:16.572
We believe that a body 
might interest you. 

25:16.607 --> 25:18.007
Katie Stebbes? 

25:18.160 --> 25:20.281
No, we'll take the lake. 

25:20.420 --> 25:23.120
Had a disc of hockey 
mouth, dressed with ribbon. 

25:25.694 --> 25:27.573
It was this guy who 
you talking about? 

25:27.700 --> 25:29.849
Is. 

25:30.085 --> 25:32.388
So how did you know about him? 

25:32.540 --> 25:35.540
Just joined a list of 
Gary goalkeeper called ... 

25:36.415 --> 25:40.415
And when we talk, he obviously 
knew something about Katie. 

25:40.416 --> 25:41.828
He was the killer? 

25:41.854 --> 25:46.198
I do not know, I saw fire, 
blood in the water 

25:46.328 --> 25:48.622
and then 
I saw him with it. 

25:48.771 --> 25:50.718
She was well 
and out of the room. 

25:50.864 --> 25:53.864
- I saw him kill her. 
- No. 

25:54.607 --> 25:56.280
Caused his death? 

25:56.427 --> 25:59.027
No. He just caused. 
The question is: Who did it? 

25:59.804 --> 26:02.484
We gotta go. 

26:08.482 --> 26:11.213
- Gary Rose. 
- Never heard of it. 

26:11.928 --> 26:13.428
This may bring 
some memory. 

26:16.012 --> 26:18.212
The color of it 
is not very good. 

26:19.512 --> 26:21.912
Remember the accusation 
of aggression that reported? 

26:23.451 --> 26:25.237
The Gary not. 

26:25.272 --> 26:27.270
He spent two years 
in Kingston so. 

26:27.305 --> 26:29.469
A terrible coincidence, 
huh? 

26:29.622 --> 26:32.970
Yes 
But so what? 

26:33.005 --> 26:37.305
Relax. She does not know anything. 

26:37.853 --> 26:40.253
Arthur Stebbes you asked 
to do this? 

26:42.336 --> 26:45.586
I do not speak with Arthur since 
the day I was arrested. 

26:46.236 --> 26:48.086
Okay? 
Look ... 

26:48.121 --> 26:49.674
All I know is: 

26:49.795 --> 26:52.145
His son, Tyler, 
trying to sell 

26:52.180 --> 26:53.880
its share in business. 

26:53.915 --> 26:56.265
Says that will change 
for Europe. 

26:57.002 --> 27:00.885
What think? 
He is burning the. 

27:02.719 --> 27:04.219
Okay, Bartolo. 

27:14.630 --> 27:16.030
So what has? 

27:16.065 --> 27:18.690
He knows more than he says. 
Is thinking in Spanish: 

27:18.824 --> 27:21.944
"Stay calm. Relax. 
She does not know anything. " 

27:22.294 --> 27:24.352
And he is right. 
It was everything that it? 

27:24.407 --> 27:25.807
Been. 

27:27.562 --> 27:30.262
Have to be 
an eye on him, then. 

27:38.074 --> 27:40.424
I have some questions 
for you, Tyler. 

27:49.777 --> 27:51.186
I have no idea of who is. 

27:51.330 --> 27:53.530
The name Gary Rose 
family huh? 

27:54.164 --> 27:55.764
Is that Gary? 

27:58.374 --> 28:00.974
No. Why do you ask? 

28:08.638 --> 28:10.238
My God. 

28:13.787 --> 28:15.387
This is the guy who killed Katie. 

28:16.355 --> 28:17.755
You think your father is innocent? 

28:17.790 --> 28:20.090
Can you explain why 
I'm here, Detective? 

28:20.750 --> 28:22.150
I will return. 

28:33.245 --> 28:36.445
So they both know 
something. 

28:36.480 --> 28:39.130
- He knows, and is ... 
- Think about it are together? 

28:40.309 --> 28:42.609
Maybe, I do not know. 
I do not know. 

28:43.935 --> 28:45.535
Something is happening here. 

29:00.749 --> 29:03.299
- You again. 
- Gary Rose. 

29:04.459 --> 29:07.859
Gary Rose? 
Never heard of him. 

29:07.894 --> 29:10.879
- He was a goalie in hockey. 
- It was a rowdy. 

29:12.274 --> 29:15.424
And what? 
Think he killed Katie? 

29:15.459 --> 29:18.267
No, but we are sure that your 
Bartolo partner knew Gary 

29:18.302 --> 29:19.802
and now Gary is dead. 

29:19.965 --> 29:22.065
Must be the guy 
he hired. 

29:22.865 --> 29:24.965
Think you can 
was the Bartolo? 

29:25.000 --> 29:27.585
Someone betrayed me. 

29:27.620 --> 29:29.470
He knew that his son, 
Tyler, is negotiating 

29:29.505 --> 29:31.105
to sell the company 
for Bartolo? 

29:32.535 --> 29:34.528
He always wanted 
my company. 

29:34.681 --> 29:36.231
And Tyler? 

29:36.266 --> 29:38.516
He had a case 
with his wife. 

29:41.759 --> 29:44.259
You know, she always 
had good taste. 

29:44.294 --> 29:45.794
He could have killed her? 

29:46.831 --> 29:50.631
I do not know what happened. 

29:50.632 --> 29:52.035
Listen! 

29:52.966 --> 29:54.466
I never cease! 

29:54.501 --> 29:55.901
Never! 

30:03.075 --> 30:05.915
Sure. 

30:16.408 --> 30:18.456
I am going. 

30:20.884 --> 30:23.175
You're horrible, 
between. 

30:23.210 --> 30:25.110
Thank you. 

30:26.644 --> 30:29.143
You were stuck with 
our friend Charlie? 

30:29.178 --> 30:31.162
Has been complicated. 

30:31.197 --> 30:33.844
Is increasingly difficult to say 
if Arthur is guilty or not. 

30:34.358 --> 30:36.870
Bartolo may have contracted 
Gary Arthur to blame. 

30:36.905 --> 30:39.449
Arthur found that Tyler 
had an affair with his stepmother, 

30:39.484 --> 30:41.199
and he did Bartolo 
hire Gary. 

30:41.200 --> 30:44.371
Or Katie ended with 
Tyler, who hired Gary. 

30:44.406 --> 30:46.028
Arthur or the killed. 

30:46.029 --> 30:48.458
Know what I mean? 
It is complicated. 

30:48.493 --> 30:50.684
I think that was Tyler. 

30:50.719 --> 30:53.911
- Why do you think that? 
- I do not know, is a kick. 

30:53.946 --> 30:56.303
There is something so bad, 
take these kicks. 

30:57.234 --> 31:00.815
We should try again with 
this guy, something will. 

31:01.333 --> 31:02.825
Okay, you want to talk to him? 

31:02.826 --> 31:04.302
Yes, I do. 

31:04.303 --> 31:06.055
- Okay, come on. 
- Come on. 

31:12.642 --> 31:14.120
Sorry, I'm leaving. 

31:14.121 --> 31:16.600
If it is talk 
for a few minutes? 

31:16.601 --> 31:18.001
Sorry, I'm in a hurry. 

31:18.002 --> 31:21.779
It is on the case of his father. 
We discovered a few things. 

31:22.181 --> 31:23.905
- What? 
- We can talk there? 

31:23.906 --> 31:25.490
Little cold out here. 

31:25.491 --> 31:28.036
- What is discovered? 
- It means that complicated. 

31:28.037 --> 31:29.643
I have to change it? 

31:29.644 --> 31:32.572
- So if it is ... 
- I turn on the alarm. 

31:32.607 --> 31:35.068
Are things you 
I wonder ... 

31:35.070 --> 31:37.003
And thank you, Tyler. 

31:37.683 --> 31:41.494
You know, I think is right, 
he is concerned about it. 

31:44.639 --> 31:48.278
Take a look ... 

32:01.923 --> 32:04.237
Not come very close. 

32:39.951 --> 32:41.352
It is the car of Charlie. 

32:41.353 --> 32:43.317
She also followed? 

32:46.128 --> 32:48.323
- Toby, no. 
- Send an alert. 

32:48.358 --> 32:51.143
Do not leave the car, Toby. 

33:44.524 --> 33:48.416
- Toby, what are you doing here? 
- I followed the Tyler, and you? 

33:48.451 --> 33:50.351
Bartolo. 

34:24.371 --> 34:26.272
Ln. 
Stay here. 

34:26.279 --> 34:28.801
Be careful. 

34:35.626 --> 34:37.525
Stopped. 

34:51.750 --> 34:53.158
Detective. 

34:53.159 --> 34:54.592
Reinforcement is the path. 

34:54.594 --> 34:56.695
Call the coroner. 

34:57.372 --> 34:58.885
Okay? 

34:58.886 --> 35:01.504
- So what happened? 
- The suspect had a gun. 

35:01.539 --> 35:03.737
Gave my gun to 
try to do it be stopped, 

35:03.772 --> 35:05.963
He shot once in my 
direction and shot back. 

35:05.998 --> 35:08.182
Roger, we are way. 

35:11.968 --> 35:13.453
I followed the suspect ... 

35:22.667 --> 35:24.965
- Hello? 
- Tyler? 

35:25.595 --> 35:27.041
You have been achieved? 

35:27.042 --> 35:29.835
- It's my arm. 
- Let me take a look. 

35:29.870 --> 35:32.219
- Is he right? 
- Who is it? 

35:34.498 --> 35:36.250
- Tyler. 
- Katie. 

35:36.251 --> 35:38.545
- Ok. 
- Katie? 

35:38.580 --> 35:40.580
Katie Stebbes? 

35:42.476 --> 35:44.168
All is well. 

35:44.169 --> 35:46.125
My God. 

35:49.305 --> 35:53.899
I woke, and found 
I heard a noise. 

35:53.934 --> 35:55.843
I was looking for. 

35:55.878 --> 35:58.735
And in time you came back 
to my room ... 

35:59.908 --> 36:02.006
had a guy there. 

36:02.544 --> 36:04.195
I thought it was a thief. 

36:04.196 --> 36:06.723
Drop the gun. 

36:12.638 --> 36:15.282
Kick it back. 

36:16.334 --> 36:18.463
Look, I have information. 

36:18.498 --> 36:20.856
Valuable information. 

36:20.891 --> 36:23.707
I can tell you something 
that can save your life. 

36:28.164 --> 36:32.530
When understood 
of what he spoke, 

36:33.191 --> 36:35.663
it was not a robbery. 

36:35.698 --> 36:38.711
Arthur wanted me dead. 

36:38.746 --> 36:41.567
So I said: 
Okay. 

36:41.602 --> 36:44.653
Be dead. 
Arthur mistake, 

36:44.688 --> 36:48.864
he will go to prison, 
Tyler will be with everything. 

36:48.899 --> 36:52.363
I bought a new identity for 
to Katie, we went to Spain. 

36:52.398 --> 36:55.009
But Gary has not 
the whole story, right? 

36:55.044 --> 36:57.313
- It was Arthur. 
- No. 

36:57.348 --> 36:59.124
Found that 
that night was Bartolo. 

36:59.125 --> 37:01.617
Bartolo off the truth 
to Gary before killing him. 

37:01.652 --> 37:04.165
Therefore it was 
behind you. 

37:04.317 --> 37:07.038
He was burning the. 

37:07.073 --> 37:09.617
We found our man. 

37:23.052 --> 37:25.011
How are you? 

37:25.046 --> 37:27.100
This is the price for me 
out of prison, is not it? 

37:27.101 --> 37:28.662
That's it. 

37:29.619 --> 37:31.134
It's the check? 

37:32.011 --> 37:35.371
- Thank you. 
- I thank you. 

37:35.406 --> 37:37.335
Ms Bay 

37:37.370 --> 37:39.106
Your mortgage is no more. 

37:39.107 --> 37:42.853
- Mom, Dad. 
- That is the man. 

37:42.854 --> 37:45.460
Mr. Stebbes thanks, 
thank you very much! 

37:45.495 --> 37:47.147
My whole family appreciates. 
This is Arthur Stebbes. 

37:47.148 --> 37:49.282
- Mom and Dad, thanks. 
- Thanks. 

37:53.361 --> 37:55.161
Man, how good 
being outside. 

37:55.162 --> 37:57.627
I'm sure, as 
Tyler vai? 

37:57.662 --> 38:00.437
You know how, 
he is flesh and bone. 

38:00.438 --> 38:04.325
Knew nothing about Bartolo. 
I thought it was. 

38:04.360 --> 38:07.008
And you thought 
Bartolo you were? 

38:08.038 --> 38:11.294
I want her dead. I 
mind and will, just do it! 

38:11.329 --> 38:15.084
No, he tricked me 
throughout. 

38:17.904 --> 38:20.049
I know how. 

38:20.739 --> 38:23.755
And Katie? 

38:23.790 --> 38:27.565
You know, I believe in forgiveness. 

38:27.600 --> 38:29.828
But not for her. 

38:38.803 --> 38:40.276
Discounts the check now. 

38:40.277 --> 38:42.559
- Now? 
- Yes!
