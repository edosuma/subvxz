WEBVTT

00:03.985 --> 00:06.750
You know, if I wasn't me,
I would hate me.

00:08.289 --> 00:11.054
Well, I'm not you
and I can see your point.

00:13.061 --> 00:17.829
Oh, man! Who's stinking up
my refrigerator with this octopus?

00:18.833 --> 00:21.393
That's Monique.
She's my date for the hockey game.

00:23.438 --> 00:27.967
Explain to me again why
Red Wing fans throw octopi on the ice.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.141
Because sushi is way
too expensive, honey.

00:32.146 --> 00:34.585
All right, guys, I'll be home by
midnight. What car should I take?

00:34.615 --> 00:37.055
Better take the Nomad. I'm gonna use
the Mustang for the hockey game.

00:37.085 --> 00:39.816
No, you can't take the Nomad.
I'm going to the movies with Patty.

00:39.887 --> 00:41.913
What about the Healey? Is it running?

00:44.192 --> 00:45.930
Guys, what am I supposed to use
for transportation?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.485
Use your bike.

00:49.263 --> 00:50.492
Dad, I'm going on a date.

00:50.565 --> 00:52.470
You ride up to her house,
you ring the bell a couple of times,

00:52.500 --> 00:53.991
chicks dig that stuff.

00:55.336 --> 00:56.360
Guys, this is ridiculous.

00:56.437 --> 00:58.943
I mean, we have three cars
and I still don't have anything to drive.

00:58.973 --> 01:00.545
I mean, when am I going to get
my own car?

01:00.575 --> 01:02.339
We're not gonna just give you
a car, Brad.

01:02.443 --> 01:03.915
Well, Dad, that's why
I've been working so hard.

01:03.945 --> 01:05.470
I mean, I've saved over $2,000.

01:05.546 --> 01:07.606
And on my last report card
I got all A's and B's.

01:07.682 --> 01:09.150
You saved $2,000?

01:09.217 --> 01:11.584
Hold on. You got all A's and B's?

01:13.554 --> 01:15.318
- Yes.
- Really?

01:15.390 --> 01:18.519
I'm proud of you, man.
I'm telling you, that's good work.

01:18.593 --> 01:19.686
But I think this is...

01:19.761 --> 01:22.925
The last thing your mom wants
around here right now is another car.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.590
Actually, I was just thinking that
he's worked very hard

01:25.666 --> 01:27.635
and deserves his own car.

01:28.069 --> 01:29.628
- Really?
- Really?

01:31.005 --> 01:32.443
Well, sure.
I mean, he's saved a lot of money

01:32.473 --> 01:33.778
and we could match that, couldn't we?

01:33.808 --> 01:35.113
- Sure we could match that.
- Yeah!

01:35.143 --> 01:36.681
And on top of that,
I'll spend every waking moment

01:36.711 --> 01:38.441
getting you the best car possible.

01:38.513 --> 01:39.879
- Cool. Thanks.
- Yeah!

01:39.981 --> 01:41.085
- You know what I'm thinking of doing?
- What?

01:41.115 --> 01:43.983
I'll get an old Mercury. I'll chop it.
I'll make a custom out of it.

01:44.051 --> 01:45.781
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
An old Camaro!

01:45.853 --> 01:47.692
Update it, put a Vette rear end in it.
I got it!

01:47.722 --> 01:48.960
- Dad...
- No. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.027
- I'll go with it...
- Dad.

01:50.057 --> 01:51.396
- Maybe I'll get an off-the-road thing.
- Dad!

01:51.426 --> 01:52.463
- Hold on! Let me...
- Dad!

01:52.493 --> 01:54.359
- What?
- This is my car.

01:54.429 --> 01:55.453
- Yes!
- Yes.

01:55.530 --> 01:56.793
Your car.

01:56.864 --> 01:59.871
Well, I guess I'm gonna call Samantha
and see if she can drive. Thanks, guys.

01:59.901 --> 02:02.373
That's a great idea, matching the funds
for his car. That's wonderful.

02:02.403 --> 02:04.675
Well, I did it 'cause I want him
to have a really cool car,

02:04.705 --> 02:07.265
and money is no object
when it comes to my oldest son

02:07.375 --> 02:10.139
getting a really bitching set of wheels.

02:12.046 --> 02:13.618
The money's coming out
of my car budget, isn't it?

02:13.648 --> 02:14.946
Oh, yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.565 --> 03:06.727
Welcome back to <i>Tool Time</i>
and our salute...

03:06.801 --> 03:09.361
Come on down.
Everything must go. <i>Se habla español.</i>

03:10.071 --> 03:11.801
to used cars.

03:13.207 --> 03:14.579
For those of you who just joined us,

03:14.609 --> 03:16.578
my son Brad is in the audience
right there.

03:16.644 --> 03:17.907
He's buying his first car.

03:17.979 --> 03:20.312
Hopefully, this '88 Mustang GT
right here.

03:20.381 --> 03:21.819
But before he buys it,
we're gonna help him out

03:21.849 --> 03:24.614
by giving the car
a complete mechanical inspection.

03:24.685 --> 03:26.586
And assuming that checks out,

03:26.654 --> 03:29.594
then we're gonna show you, right here
on the air, how to negotiate a fair deal.

03:29.624 --> 03:31.262
That's right.
We've already test-driven it

03:31.292 --> 03:34.228
and inspected the frame and
suspension, including the brakes.

03:34.295 --> 03:36.924
And I've checked the oil, the fan belt
and the master cylinder.

03:36.998 --> 03:39.058
Everything checks out a-okay.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.372
And now we're under the hood
completing a compression test.

03:41.402 --> 03:42.740
Compression test is a great way
to find out

03:42.770 --> 03:45.376
if your rings are in good shape
or if you've had a crack in the block.

03:45.406 --> 03:49.343
Now, my gauge should read
between 120 and 130 pounds.

03:49.410 --> 03:53.074
The last time your gauge read that,
you were six years old.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.219
Okay, perfect. 130 pounds.

03:58.286 --> 04:02.314
That's just perfect. Now, it's time to
start dealing. Right, Brad? All right.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.461
Let's meet the owner of this beauty.

04:03.491 --> 04:07.258
Let's have a warm <i>Tool Time</i> welcome
for Mr. Michael McCready.

04:16.803 --> 04:19.672
Well, Mike, you did something
to your hair, huh?

04:19.740 --> 04:23.836
I'm Thelma, Michael's mother.
I'm the actual owner of the car.

04:23.911 --> 04:26.244
Mikey was just helping me out
showing it to you.

04:26.314 --> 04:29.546
Oh, here. I brought you kids
some homemade jelly donuts.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.519
- Well, thank you.
- This is the oldest trick in the book.

04:32.587 --> 04:36.024
Send an old lady to soften up the buyer
with fresh donuts.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.956
I'm on to you, Granny.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.727
I'm sorry, Mrs. McCready.
I apologize for Tim's behavior.

04:42.797 --> 04:45.494
That's okay. I've seen <i>Tool Time.</i>

04:45.566 --> 04:48.502
I know that sometimes
he can be a real schmo.

04:49.503 --> 04:51.028
Have a donut, Al.

04:51.105 --> 04:53.438
Oh, no. I couldn't.
Not while I'm working.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.547
Oh, I made them with
my special boysenberry filling.

04:56.377 --> 04:57.538
Really?

04:57.645 --> 04:59.477
Well, maybe just one.

04:59.547 --> 05:00.674
Lesson number one.

05:00.748 --> 05:03.054
You want to make sure that the seller
is honest and trustworthy.

05:03.084 --> 05:05.289
Which begs the question,
why would a woman who voted for,

05:05.319 --> 05:07.481
I'm guessing, Calvin Coolidge

05:08.623 --> 05:10.990
be selling a V-8 Mustang?

05:11.392 --> 05:13.691
Well, actually,
it was my late husband's car.

05:13.761 --> 05:17.254
Oh, the old late-husband routine,
you know.

05:17.331 --> 05:20.267
What we're going to hear now is you
only drive it to church on Sunday?

05:20.368 --> 05:22.735
Oh, no. We took the Trans Am.

05:25.373 --> 05:28.434
And now it's time for
the all-important negotiation.

05:28.509 --> 05:31.172
That's right. Now, all used cars
have a blue book value.

05:31.245 --> 05:32.883
Low book is what a dealer
might pay for it.

05:32.913 --> 05:34.643
High book is what he'd sell it for.

05:34.715 --> 05:37.981
Thelma's asking price came right
in the middle, $4,000.

05:38.052 --> 05:40.749
All right. I'll give you $2,500 for it.

05:40.821 --> 05:44.451
$2,500?
After all the work we put in this car?

05:44.525 --> 05:47.290
You take another look under the hood.
It's as clean as a whistle.

05:47.395 --> 05:50.229
Well, Tim, it does look
pretty clean to me.

05:56.003 --> 05:58.871
Well, it was until you slobbered jelly
all over it.

05:58.939 --> 06:01.067
Geez, I'm sorry!

06:01.142 --> 06:05.512
Oh, now it's all dirty. You'll have to
knock off a little. How about $2,450?

06:05.579 --> 06:06.842
Do we have a deal?

06:06.914 --> 06:08.177
No, we do not.

06:08.249 --> 06:11.083
And I'm insulted by your offer
and your disrespectful attitude.

06:11.152 --> 06:12.916
I'm not gonna sell you this car.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.081
All right, $2,750
and I'll give you a ride home.

06:16.857 --> 06:20.294
No deal, Tool Man.
I'm taking my wheels and leaving.

06:20.361 --> 06:23.729
All right. All right. All right. $3,000.
And that's my final offer.

06:23.798 --> 06:26.290
And here's my final offer. Bite me!

06:29.236 --> 06:31.102
Dad, you're blowing the deal.

06:31.172 --> 06:35.337
All right. I'm willing to go to $3,500.
$3,500, that's fair.

06:35.443 --> 06:38.311
Forget it! Put the spark plug back in
and give me my key.

06:38.379 --> 06:41.281
Please, Mrs. McCready.
I really want that car.

06:41.348 --> 06:46.286
Oh, you seem like a nice boy.
You must take after your mom.

06:49.056 --> 06:51.821
All right. I'll let you have it for $2,500.

06:51.892 --> 06:54.828
All right! See? $2,500 it is.

06:54.895 --> 06:57.660
- Plus the cost of the donuts.
- Okay. What could they cost?

06:57.732 --> 06:59.098
$2,000.

07:02.002 --> 07:03.732
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Brad.

07:03.804 --> 07:06.467
I got all the pictures of me
and the Mustang.

07:06.540 --> 07:09.203
- Let me take a look at them.
- All right.

07:10.378 --> 07:13.348
- Oh, here we are at the gas station.
- Yeah.

07:14.148 --> 07:16.583
Here I am giving it its first oil change.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.312
Nice.

07:18.385 --> 07:21.219
Oh, here I am putting on
five coats of wax.

07:21.722 --> 07:23.281
- Carnauba?
- Oh, yeah.

07:24.525 --> 07:26.892
Oh, here we are just being silly.

07:29.029 --> 07:31.589
- Hey, that's the one with me.
- Yeah.

07:31.699 --> 07:32.870
Too bad you didn't get a reprint for me.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.267
Oh, Dad, I am way ahead of you, man.

07:35.336 --> 07:36.964
All right!

07:40.341 --> 07:41.866
How's the stew coming?

07:41.942 --> 07:44.002
I don't know.
I've never done this before.

07:44.078 --> 07:48.174
Oh, well, honey, it's your first time,
you know? And that's always kind of...

07:51.185 --> 07:54.212
This is incredible. What did you do?

07:54.288 --> 07:58.658
Well, you know, I followed the recipe
and made sure you didn't touch it.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.085
Good going.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.060
Hey, Tim! Dinner's ready!

08:04.131 --> 08:05.497
Nah. I'm not really that hungry.

08:05.599 --> 08:07.261
I didn't cook it.

08:07.334 --> 08:08.825
I am famished.

08:10.871 --> 08:12.100
Where's Bradley?

08:12.173 --> 08:13.973
Same place he's been
for the last three weeks,

08:14.041 --> 08:15.475
attached at the hip to the Mustang.

08:15.543 --> 08:17.307
Yeah, that's my boy.

08:18.679 --> 08:21.239
- Well, my car got stolen.
- What?

08:21.315 --> 08:22.419
Yeah, right in front of the high school.

08:22.449 --> 08:25.749
You know, I always had a bad feeling
about that place.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.584
I can't believe it.

08:27.655 --> 08:29.817
- Did you call the police?
- Yeah, I called the police.

08:29.890 --> 08:33.054
Then I had to ride home
on that stupid yellow bus.

08:34.528 --> 08:35.826
Well, what did they say?

08:35.895 --> 08:38.764
"Hey, what's the cool guy doing
on the bus?"

08:41.969 --> 08:43.301
The police.

08:44.638 --> 08:48.075
Oh, they said they hope
I have a good insurance policy.

08:48.142 --> 08:49.180
Well, I know the guys down
at the precinct.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.449
I'll give them a call and make sure
they're doing it the right way.

08:51.479 --> 08:52.970
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

08:53.047 --> 08:54.685
Yeah, I know.
I loved that car more than anything.

08:54.715 --> 08:56.081
Well, maybe they'll find it.

08:56.183 --> 08:57.621
Or if they don't, you know,
we got insurance.

08:57.651 --> 08:58.880
We can get you another car.

08:58.953 --> 09:01.616
I know, Mom. But I don't want
another one. I want my car.

09:01.689 --> 09:04.215
Well, look, your dad's gonna do
everything he can do.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.522
Hello, Officer. Yeah. This is Tim Taylor.

09:06.594 --> 09:09.194
Well, apparently, my son's car
just got stolen at the high school.

09:09.263 --> 09:11.129
And I'm giving away
free <i>Tool Time</i> tickets

09:11.198 --> 09:13.895
to the first group of guys that find it.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.707
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me!

09:22.409 --> 09:25.777
You know, I fail to see the humor
in what I just said.

09:27.882 --> 09:30.351
Brad, come on.
You got to try some of Mark's stew.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.716
We usually don't eat this well.

09:34.688 --> 09:36.794
I know, Dad. I just can't believe
my car is gone, you know?

09:36.824 --> 09:38.662
I keep thinking
I'm gonna step out that front door

09:38.692 --> 09:40.164
and she's gonna be there
waiting for me.

09:40.194 --> 09:41.287
It'll get back to you.

09:41.362 --> 09:43.501
Some kids probably just took it
for a joy ride. Come on, sit down.

09:43.531 --> 09:45.591
I know. But, Dad,
we put so much work into that car.

09:45.666 --> 09:47.586
I mean, what?
Didn't we test-drive, like, 15 cars

09:47.635 --> 09:49.399
before we decided
which one was best for me?

09:49.470 --> 09:53.601
Well, 16 if you count the Ferrari
we drove just for the fun of it.

09:54.241 --> 09:56.369
So, Dad, have you ever had
a car stolen before?

09:56.443 --> 09:59.572
No. But I've experienced
every car disaster known to man.

09:59.647 --> 10:03.106
Floods, fires,
jockstrap caught in the fan belt.

10:05.686 --> 10:08.178
It was a fraternity thing, you know?

10:12.226 --> 10:14.855
Yo. Yeah, it's Tim Taylor.

10:14.928 --> 10:16.400
They found it.
Yeah, leave it where it is.

10:16.430 --> 10:19.110
We'll come down and pick it up.
Don't take it to impound, all right?

10:19.600 --> 10:23.765
456 Franklin between Adams
and Walton. I got it.

10:23.837 --> 10:24.917
Okay, we'll be right there.

10:26.473 --> 10:28.499
It's completely stripped.

10:28.576 --> 10:31.273
Oh, man!
I can't believe my car is gone.

10:32.313 --> 10:35.181
Officer, what's your plan of attack now?

10:35.249 --> 10:38.310
Well, I'll call the tow truck,
they'll haul it to impound,

10:38.385 --> 10:40.320
then I'll take a break.

10:41.055 --> 10:44.617
Well, that ought to put the fear of God
in those thugs.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.228
You're saying there's nothing
we can do?

10:47.328 --> 10:50.492
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor. But you have
to catch these guys red-handed.

10:50.564 --> 10:53.295
You see, the vehicle parts
don't necessarily correspond

10:53.367 --> 10:55.029
with any individual cars.

10:55.102 --> 10:56.434
So, even if they find yours,

10:56.503 --> 10:59.268
you can't prove they were stolen
from your vehicle.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.899
Thanks, anyway.

11:00.974 --> 11:03.714
I'll fill out the report, and we'll
get back to you if we find anything.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.110
Sorry, kid.

11:06.914 --> 11:08.883
So, my car's gone forever.

11:08.982 --> 11:11.349
Oh, honey. Look, let's just go home
and get some sleep,

11:11.452 --> 11:14.422
and tomorrow we can go out
and look for another car.

11:14.488 --> 11:17.754
You know, I can't believe this. I mean,
there's nothing they can do about this?

11:17.825 --> 11:20.317
I'm with Brad. Somebody's got
to be held accountable for this.

11:20.394 --> 11:22.394
You heard the officer.
There's nothing they can do.

11:22.463 --> 11:24.159
Well, maybe there's nothing
they can do.

11:24.231 --> 11:25.665
There's something I can do.

11:25.733 --> 11:28.472
I'm the guy that delivered a baby after
being crowned "Car Guy of the Year."

11:28.502 --> 11:30.869
The same night!
I'm the guy that built a lawnmower

11:30.971 --> 11:32.667
that can do 12 seconds
in the quarter mile.

11:32.740 --> 11:35.801
I'm the guy that put a barbecue grill
into geosynchronous orbit.

11:35.876 --> 11:38.038
So, don't you tell me
there's nothing we can do.

11:38.145 --> 11:40.705
I'm The Tool Man! I can fix anything!

11:46.720 --> 11:49.690
Okay. Fine.
Then zip up your fly and let's go.

11:57.364 --> 12:00.425
No, listen, Officer, I got this tip from
a friend of mine named Eddie.

12:00.501 --> 12:02.436
He owns Eddie's Body Shop.

12:02.503 --> 12:05.564
He says it's a place called A-1 Salvage
that's selling stolen parts.

12:05.639 --> 12:08.268
So, I figured you guys got to go
down there and check it out.

12:08.342 --> 12:11.676
What do you mean, you need
a warrant? This is America.

12:12.513 --> 12:15.142
Okay. All right. Thank you.

12:16.483 --> 12:17.576
What was all that about?

12:17.651 --> 12:21.088
I got a lead on an auto shop
that might be selling stolen Ford parts.

12:21.155 --> 12:22.459
The police won't go down
to check it out,

12:22.489 --> 12:24.651
so I thought maybe I should.

12:24.725 --> 12:26.660
Are you insane?

12:26.727 --> 12:28.787
Those guys could be
dangerous criminals.

12:28.862 --> 12:30.956
Hello. Soufflé in the oven.

12:32.266 --> 12:34.338
Well, this might have something to do
with Brad's stolen car.

12:34.368 --> 12:36.173
You're not gonna accomplish anything
by running around,

12:36.203 --> 12:37.831
acting like a vigilante lunatic.

12:37.905 --> 12:39.533
People, please.

12:41.175 --> 12:42.336
You're right, though.

12:42.443 --> 12:45.140
Just like the cop said, even if I could
go down and find the parts,

12:45.212 --> 12:46.917
there's no way I could prove
they came from Brad's car.

12:46.947 --> 12:49.041
Okay. Now you're making some sense.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.086
What I need to do is take a couple
months off of work, grow a beard,

12:52.186 --> 12:55.247
get a job on the inside
and become one of them.

12:56.757 --> 12:59.522
Hey, Wilson. What are you doing?

12:59.626 --> 13:02.960
Well, I'm getting ready
to give my honey to a friend.

13:05.065 --> 13:07.830
She sounds like
a very understanding woman.

13:08.469 --> 13:09.994
No, no, no, no, no, Tim.

13:10.070 --> 13:13.006
See, I'm bottling honey to take
to a Crespian festival.

13:13.073 --> 13:15.273
Did you realize that in Crespia
they pay homage to honey

13:15.342 --> 13:17.072
because to them it's symbolic of gold?

13:17.144 --> 13:18.908
How do they celebrate that in Detroit?

13:18.979 --> 13:21.312
Well, we have a little honey,

13:21.381 --> 13:23.454
and then we get all liquored up
and put on funny hats.

13:23.484 --> 13:25.146
Do you want to come?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.384
I'm not in that funny of a mood.

13:28.455 --> 13:30.947
So, I take it you're still upset
about Brad's car.

13:31.024 --> 13:34.483
You're darn right I am. And I even got
a tip of who might have stolen it.

13:34.561 --> 13:35.632
But the police aren't interested

13:35.662 --> 13:37.034
because they don't have any evidence,
you know?

13:37.064 --> 13:38.760
I feel so helpless.

13:38.832 --> 13:40.198
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.566
You know, I was robbed once
when I was 12.

13:42.636 --> 13:44.605
I was riding my brother's unicycle.

13:44.705 --> 13:47.072
Did they steal one of your tires?

13:49.042 --> 13:52.206
No, no. This big bully came,
pushed me off and took it.

13:52.279 --> 13:54.111
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

13:54.181 --> 13:58.551
It was that hooligan Terry Zavacas.
Sold it. I didn't have any evidence.

13:58.652 --> 14:00.917
- So you never caught him?
- Her.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.559
It was one of the most
humiliating experiences of my life.

14:05.626 --> 14:07.131
I mean, just talking about it right now is

14:07.161 --> 14:09.494
just bringing up
all these ugly memories.

14:09.563 --> 14:11.896
God, I hated Terry Zavacas and...

14:11.965 --> 14:13.137
- Wilson! Wilson!
- that sleazy band of...

14:13.167 --> 14:15.659
Hey, calm down, buddy.

14:15.736 --> 14:19.832
Just think about all the fun
you'll have at that lesbian festival.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.805
It's a Crespian festival.

14:22.876 --> 14:24.742
And you're right.
I do have to collect myself.

14:24.812 --> 14:28.874
I must call my good friend Guillermo
and remind him to bring the donuts.

14:29.082 --> 14:31.847
Donuts! Donuts!
That's the answer to my question.

14:31.919 --> 14:33.649
- What?
- Yeah. Mrs. McCready,

14:33.720 --> 14:37.054
the boysenberry filling, the manifold,
Al slobbering all over it.

14:37.124 --> 14:39.286
It's totally clear right now.
Thanks, Wilson!

14:39.393 --> 14:43.160
I think somebody's been doing
a little celebrating on their own.

14:46.867 --> 14:49.029
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

14:51.838 --> 14:54.205
Tim, you look like Juan Valdez.

14:59.046 --> 15:01.515
Al and I are going down to
this chop shop, A-1 Salvage,

15:01.582 --> 15:04.746
to look for stolen parts and I don't want
anyone to recognize me.

15:04.851 --> 15:06.557
I assume this has something to do
with Brad's car.

15:06.587 --> 15:07.611
Yes.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.452
We're looking for evidence
to give the cops.

15:09.556 --> 15:12.720
Tim, it sounds a little dangerous.
Are you sure you should be doing this?

15:12.793 --> 15:15.024
We just got to be careful, clever
and discreet.

15:15.095 --> 15:17.860
Wait till you see this. Al.
Look at the spy cam.

15:18.098 --> 15:19.098
Oh.

15:21.935 --> 15:24.632
You don't think anyone might
notice that?

15:27.174 --> 15:30.042
I don't think these costumes
are gonna work.

15:35.082 --> 15:37.608
I disagree. I think they look great.

15:37.918 --> 15:39.477
I don't know.

15:42.956 --> 15:45.448
It's just I have a very bad feeling
about this.

15:45.525 --> 15:47.653
Why did I ever agree
to come down here?

15:47.728 --> 15:49.299
Because you're the one
that ate the donut.

15:49.329 --> 15:51.501
You're the only one that can identify
the boysenberry jelly

15:51.531 --> 15:52.569
that fell on the manifold.

15:52.599 --> 15:55.694
I am not a crime stopper.
What if they frisk me?

15:57.304 --> 16:00.069
These guys are criminals,
not masochists.

16:00.741 --> 16:02.710
Turn the camera on.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.805
All right. Friday.

16:07.714 --> 16:11.651
5:15. Tim Taylor and Al Borland go in
looking for stolen parts.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.749
Mother, if something happens to me,

16:15.822 --> 16:18.348
you can have all
my John Tesh albums.

16:20.594 --> 16:21.653
What can I do for you?

16:21.728 --> 16:22.933
We're looking for some car parts.

16:22.963 --> 16:26.730
That's right. A part. That's all we're
looking for, just a part. Just a part.

16:28.035 --> 16:29.594
What are you looking for?

16:29.703 --> 16:32.400
Maybe a manifold off
an '88 Ford Mustang.

16:32.472 --> 16:35.442
Manifolds are over there. I think we got
an '88 Mustang in there somewhere.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.204
- Great.
- Thank you!

16:43.984 --> 16:46.544
- Can I help you?
- No, no. We're just browsing.

16:46.653 --> 16:49.623
Well, if you need anything,
my name is George.

16:50.857 --> 16:54.157
Oh, my God, Tim!
That's the guy we met in prison.

16:55.596 --> 16:58.896
I know it! You know,
when we were scalping tickets?

16:59.166 --> 17:01.465
He'll never recognize us
with these getups on.

17:01.535 --> 17:04.699
Hey, wait a minute.
Were you guys ever in county jail?

17:05.906 --> 17:07.204
I think we showered together.

17:07.273 --> 17:11.540
I don't think so. You must have me
mistaken with some other gentleman.

17:13.814 --> 17:17.751
Mustang manifold,
something purple and sticky. Lick it.

17:21.588 --> 17:22.612
What?

17:22.689 --> 17:26.147
Well, you got to make sure
it's the right one. Lick it.

17:26.627 --> 17:27.753
Man!

17:30.831 --> 17:33.096
Why is he licking the manifold?

17:33.166 --> 17:35.533
It doesn't make him a bad person.

17:36.870 --> 17:40.637
That's boysenberry, all right.
I think we have our evidence.

17:40.707 --> 17:42.801
You can stop licking it now.

17:44.010 --> 17:49.972
All right. I think that we found
what we were looking for.

17:51.184 --> 17:54.154
- All right. What do we owe you for that?
- Hundred bucks and it's yours.

17:54.221 --> 17:57.191
And I'm sure
you'll probably want it in cash.

18:02.295 --> 18:03.820
Just pay the man, Bobby.

18:03.897 --> 18:07.061
All right. I'll pay. I'll pay them,
all right. And so will they.

18:07.167 --> 18:09.727
Hey, what is that?
Some kind of video recorder?

18:09.836 --> 18:12.271
No. That's his artificial heart.

18:13.807 --> 18:16.902
He keeps an artificial heart
in his fanny pack?

18:16.977 --> 18:19.139
HMOs. What are you gonna do?

18:22.282 --> 18:24.251
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

18:24.318 --> 18:26.844
- No, you don't.
- Yeah. You're The Tool Man.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.946
The guy who has all those accidents.

18:29.022 --> 18:30.927
Well, you're about to have
an even bigger accident.

18:30.957 --> 18:33.163
- Give me that video camera!
- No! Never! Never! Tim, take it!

18:33.193 --> 18:35.890
- Run! Run, Tim!
- What's going on here?

18:35.962 --> 18:38.591
We got a call from someone
named Heidi that there's a problem.

18:38.665 --> 18:40.937
- Oh, no. There's no problem here.
- Thank God, you guys are here.

18:40.967 --> 18:45.598
These are hardened criminals.
I know because I met George in prison.

18:49.176 --> 18:51.816
We have evidence that these
gentlemen are selling stolen car parts.

18:51.878 --> 18:53.141
Oh, they don't have squat.

18:53.213 --> 18:57.548
I got more than squat.
I got boysenberry jelly on a manifold.

18:57.617 --> 18:59.245
You got a manifold with jelly?

18:59.319 --> 19:02.221
That's right. I ought to know. I licked it.

19:04.157 --> 19:08.458
This manifold was stolen off my son's
car and I've got a videotape to prove it.

19:08.528 --> 19:12.192
Here you go, officers.
What do you think now, punks?

19:12.799 --> 19:15.564
I can't believe I let you borrow my soap.

19:23.210 --> 19:25.941
<i>In local news,
a chop shop is busted</i>

19:26.012 --> 19:28.777
<i>thanks to two local TV personalities.</i>

19:28.882 --> 19:31.317
<i>Their evidence? A jelly donut.</i>

19:31.384 --> 19:34.946
<i>Tim Taylor and Al Borland used
this segment from Tool Time</i>

19:35.055 --> 19:38.822

19:48.335 --> 19:51.305
<i>For Channel 8 News,
this is Tiffany Gutierrez.</i>

19:54.374 --> 19:55.745
You know, that just goes to show you,

19:55.775 --> 19:57.835
you don't have to sit idly by
and become a victim.

19:57.911 --> 19:59.082
You can act on your principles.

19:59.112 --> 20:01.479
I still think it was stupid for you
to go down there.

20:01.581 --> 20:05.348
In the future, I forbid either one of you
to ever act on your principles.

20:05.418 --> 20:09.253
Yeah, don't worry. Our generation
doesn't have any principles.

20:09.322 --> 20:10.483
- Good job, Dad.
- Thanks.

20:10.590 --> 20:12.058
Yeah. Way to nail those punks.

20:12.125 --> 20:15.584
Now if you excuse me,
I've got a duckling to glaze.

20:16.129 --> 20:18.135
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go check
the newspaper for a new car.

20:18.165 --> 20:20.293
Good. I know you didn't want me
going down there,

20:20.367 --> 20:21.605
but I just couldn't stand the thought of

20:21.635 --> 20:23.140
letting those guys get away
with it, okay?

20:23.170 --> 20:26.732
I just... I hate that our kids have
to think about this kind of stuff.

20:26.806 --> 20:29.173
I don't remember worrying about it
when I was growing up.

20:29.276 --> 20:30.904
You grew up on a military base.

20:30.977 --> 20:32.949
Someone steal a car, they'd take
a bazooka and form the guy...

20:32.979 --> 20:34.345
- Tim?
- Well, you know. Right.

20:34.447 --> 20:35.608
Please.

20:35.715 --> 20:38.207
Now, you know what I mean?
It's just... It's scary out there.

20:38.285 --> 20:40.290
Well, it's a lot less scary now,
thanks to a crime buster

20:40.320 --> 20:42.482
and his partner, Pop'n'Fresh.

20:45.258 --> 20:47.921
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
when Brad gets his new car,

20:47.994 --> 20:50.259
he is going to have
some kind of security system,

20:50.330 --> 20:53.164
state-of-the-art, no expense spared.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.704
Let me guess.
It's coming out of my car budget?

20:54.734 --> 20:55.997
Oh, yeah.

20:59.172 --> 21:02.142
Well, we're just about at the end
of our segment on car security.

21:02.242 --> 21:05.178
But before we go,
I'd like to show you a super-secret,

21:05.245 --> 21:08.511
high-tech alarm system, new from
the boys at Binford R and D.

21:08.582 --> 21:10.141
See, my kid's car was stolen recently.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.116
In order for that not to happen again,

21:12.185 --> 21:14.086
we've installed that
on his brand-new car here.

21:14.154 --> 21:15.782
Al, try breaking in.

21:15.855 --> 21:18.381
Oh, no. I'm not falling
for one of your traps again.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.223
Oh, no?
Your paycheck's in the glove box.

21:22.929 --> 21:24.158
Oh, man!

21:26.800 --> 21:28.564
- Well, that wasn't so hard.
- No?

21:28.668 --> 21:31.228
Once the perpetrator enters the vehicle
without authorization,

21:31.304 --> 21:34.144
the car snaps into action, locking
the doors and rolling up the windows.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.574
Tim!

21:37.811 --> 21:39.473

21:39.546 --> 21:43.074

and the master cylinder.

21:56.563 --> 21:58.589
Everything checks out a-okay.

21:58.665 --> 22:02.397

completing a compression test.

22:05.905 --> 22:07.430
Way to nail those punks.

22:07.507 --> 22:10.944
Now if you excuse me,

22:11.311 --> 22:12.370
Yeah, I think I... Wow!

22:13.546 --> 22:15.105
Get down!

22:18.184 --> 22:19.464
