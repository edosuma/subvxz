WEBVTT

00:02.062 --> 00:03.731
You are being watched.

00:03.732 --> 00:05.691
The government has a secret system...

00:05.692 --> 00:07.521
Secret system...

00:07.522 --> 00:11.101
A system you asked
for, to keep you safe.

00:11.102 --> 00:15.851
A Machine that spies on
you every hour of every day.

00:15.852 --> 00:18.521
You've granted it the
power to see everything,

00:18.522 --> 00:23.601
to index, order, and control
the lives of ordinary people.

00:23.602 --> 00:26.851
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.481
We don't.

00:28.482 --> 00:31.191
But to it, you are all irrelevant.

00:31.192 --> 00:34.651
Victim or perpetrator,
if you stand in its way...

00:34.652 --> 00:35.909
We'll find you.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.441
Good morning, John.

01:01.442 --> 01:03.731
Any updates from the subway?

01:03.732 --> 01:05.561
Are the simulations up and running?

01:05.562 --> 01:07.481
No news yet.

01:07.482 --> 01:09.481
Professor Whistler
needed to check some books out

01:09.482 --> 01:12.021
from the campus
library, so while I was out

01:12.022 --> 01:14.351
I thought I would take the
opportunity to update

01:14.352 --> 01:16.441
security at the safe house.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.402
Was there a problem with the safe house?

01:18.403 --> 01:20.271
You can't be too careful.

01:20.272 --> 01:25.351
I take it that you've managed to
track down our latest number.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.561
I'm at the Real Time Crime Center.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.941
A watcher watching the watchers.

01:29.942 --> 01:32.021
Or listener, as the case may be.

01:32.022 --> 01:33.651
Ethan Garvin.

01:33.652 --> 01:36.231
A sound analyst for ShotSeeker,

01:36.232 --> 01:39.601
an acoustic surveillance
system that uses microphones

01:39.602 --> 01:42.151
mounted across the city
to pinpoint the location

01:42.152 --> 01:45.561
of a gunshot, and can
do it to within 50 feet.

01:45.562 --> 01:47.601
I see you've done
your homework, Professor.

01:47.602 --> 01:49.731
More fun doing it than grading it.

01:49.732 --> 01:53.441
Mr. Garvin's main job is
to rule out false positives

01:53.442 --> 01:56.021
from loud noises like car backfires,

01:56.022 --> 01:58.271
before dispatching police.

01:58.272 --> 02:01.151
Right now he's wrapping
up a 12-hour night shift

02:01.152 --> 02:04.021
and slamming coffee
like he just woke up.

02:06.652 --> 02:08.020
Were those gunshots, Mr. Reese?

02:08.021 --> 02:09.520
Time will tell, Professor.

02:09.521 --> 02:10.851
Garvin's on the case.

02:10.852 --> 02:12.441
Four sensors generating data.

02:15.892 --> 02:17.481
148 decibels.

02:20.062 --> 02:21.521
Do you need a hand, Detective?

02:21.522 --> 02:23.441
Riley. My question can wait though.

02:23.442 --> 02:25.651
I want to see ShotSeeker in action.

02:25.652 --> 02:27.731
Well, ShotSeeker says it's gunfire,

02:27.732 --> 02:30.351
but the question is,
what does Garvin say?

02:36.482 --> 02:38.441
Shots fired.

02:38.442 --> 02:41.061
Shots fired near 19026 Hilltop.

02:41.062 --> 02:43.271
Unit 329, you're one block west.

02:43.272 --> 02:44.271
Copy that.

02:44.272 --> 02:46.101
Officers in pursuit.

02:46.102 --> 02:48.151
20 bucks says it's a Glock 22.

02:48.152 --> 02:50.151
Any takers?

02:50.152 --> 02:53.151
The city almost scrapped
this whole system six months ago.

02:53.152 --> 02:55.731
Too many false alarms,
but then Garvin came in,

02:55.732 --> 02:58.691
recalibrated the sensors, and
efficiency is through the roof.

02:58.692 --> 03:01.021
Okay, suspect's in custody.

03:01.022 --> 03:02.101
Nice work, Garvin.

03:02.102 --> 03:03.601
It's a Glock 22.

03:05.022 --> 03:06.601
Want to grab some lunch, Garvin?

03:06.602 --> 03:08.311
No, thanks.

03:08.312 --> 03:10.151
I promised the old
lady we'd go to sushi.

03:11.812 --> 03:13.771
And your question was?

03:13.772 --> 03:16.601
Actually, I need to take this call.

03:16.602 --> 03:18.601
Listen, babe, I got to cancel sushi.

03:18.602 --> 03:21.101
I'm getting sucked back into overtime.

03:21.102 --> 03:22.981
Garvin just lied
to his girlfriend.

03:22.982 --> 03:24.891
I wonder who else he's lying to.

03:27.232 --> 03:28.691
All right, you guys are up next.

03:28.692 --> 03:31.311
Nice good warm-up laps. Good job.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.842
- This should cover it.
- All right.

03:34.022 --> 03:35.601
Do I know you?

03:35.602 --> 03:38.101
Why don't we take
three steps to the left?

03:38.102 --> 03:40.231
Domain Awareness doesn't
need to see this.

03:43.442 --> 03:44.941
That's it.

03:44.942 --> 03:46.231
I'm on my lunch break, pal.

03:46.232 --> 03:48.488
Your son Lee is not half bad.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.561
His footwork's sloppy, but
he's good with a stick.

03:50.562 --> 03:52.645
I know talent when I see it.

03:53.724 --> 03:55.891
I also know you're
one of the last people

03:55.892 --> 03:58.731
to see Carl Elias alive.

03:58.732 --> 04:00.151
You want to know about Elias?

04:00.152 --> 04:01.851
I want to know who killed my friend.

04:01.852 --> 04:03.561
It's in my report.

04:03.562 --> 04:06.561
I don't believe police
reports written by dirty cops.

04:06.562 --> 04:08.521
- I came here for the truth.
- You got the truth.

04:08.522 --> 04:10.481
Now why don't you take off
while you still got your teeth?

04:10.482 --> 04:13.481
Let me put it to you this way,

04:13.482 --> 04:17.190
I loved Carl Elias like a brother,

04:17.192 --> 04:19.601
the way some fathers love their sons.

04:19.601 --> 04:21.690
I swear to God, you look
at my kid one more time.

04:25.522 --> 04:27.231
You don't know what
you're talking about.

04:27.232 --> 04:29.691
You're asking questions
even I don't know the answers to.

04:29.692 --> 04:31.441
Okay.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.521
I get it now.

04:33.522 --> 04:35.851
It's your partner that calls the shots

04:35.852 --> 04:38.441
even when it's your name on the report.

04:38.442 --> 04:42.441
You tell John Bruce
Moran's looking for him.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.891
I'll see you around, Detective.

05:03.652 --> 05:06.561
I like what you've done with the place.

05:06.562 --> 05:07.891
Padlock's a nice touch.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.521
A necessary precaution.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.601
We copied that malware together,

05:12.602 --> 05:14.771
and now you're seriously locking me out?

05:14.772 --> 05:18.311
More like locking Samaritan in.

05:18.312 --> 05:22.561
I used code from that laptop
to incubate a miniature clone

05:22.562 --> 05:24.441
of our enemy ASI.

05:24.442 --> 05:26.771
You put a baby Samaritan in a nursery.

05:26.772 --> 05:28.891
Just a kernel of its code

05:28.892 --> 05:31.021
trapped inside this Faraday cage.

05:31.022 --> 05:32.441
What's your plan, Harry?

05:32.442 --> 05:35.151
Zip tie it to a
chair and ask it questions?

05:35.152 --> 05:38.021
No, I thought I'd leave
that to the Machine.

05:38.022 --> 05:41.481
I've begun incubating a
similar kernel of our own ASI.

05:41.482 --> 05:44.521
Soon I'll allow the two
entities to engage one another

05:44.522 --> 05:46.601
in a series of controlled simulations

05:46.602 --> 05:48.731
with the Machine code probing
the Samaritan code

05:48.732 --> 05:49.981
for weaknesses.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.231
Like rival ASIs playing online chess.

05:53.232 --> 05:55.521
The results of the
simulations might indicate a strategy

05:55.522 --> 05:59.561
we could use against
Samaritan in the real world.

05:59.562 --> 06:00.561
When's show time?

06:00.562 --> 06:02.601
I need an hour or so.

06:02.602 --> 06:04.061
I'll go get the popcorn.

06:04.062 --> 06:06.481
Actually, Ms. Groves,

06:06.482 --> 06:08.481
this is more of a closed performance.

06:11.652 --> 06:13.601
So you are locking me out.

06:13.602 --> 06:15.771
Not just you. Everyone.

06:15.772 --> 06:18.271
If you want me to do whatever it takes,

06:18.272 --> 06:20.601
I'll have to do it on my own terms.

06:26.812 --> 06:28.891
Yes, Mr. Reese.

06:28.892 --> 06:30.891
Hold on a sec, Finch.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.271
Well, we know how
Garvin gets his second wind,

06:36.272 --> 06:38.191
and it's not Jamba Juice.

06:38.192 --> 06:43.271
Just tailed him to 607 West 126th.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.441
Low-income
housing on the edge of campus.

06:45.442 --> 06:47.561
Equally popular among the working poor

06:47.562 --> 06:51.021
or graduate students whose parents
don't pay their rent.

06:53.022 --> 06:54.291
Krupa.

06:56.602 --> 06:58.771
Finch, what's behind door number 4J?

07:00.013 --> 07:01.691
Krupa Naik.

07:01.692 --> 07:05.481
She's pursuing a doctorate in
chemistry at the university.

07:05.482 --> 07:07.851
Perhaps Mr. Garvin's chemical
stash ran low.

07:07.852 --> 07:09.521
Krupa.

07:10.602 --> 07:12.191
Hey, yo, come on, man.

07:12.192 --> 07:13.691
You again?

07:13.692 --> 07:15.561
I'm looking for Krupa
Naik. You seen her?

07:15.562 --> 07:16.941
Get lost

07:16.942 --> 07:18.731
before I call the real cops.

07:18.732 --> 07:20.981
When was the last time you saw her?

07:26.692 --> 07:28.561
W-w-wait, please. It's about Krupa.

07:28.562 --> 07:31.151
He's badgering the girl from 4E now.

07:33.522 --> 07:35.351
Mary Mulhall.

07:35.352 --> 07:37.601
She's in the same graduate
program as Krupa.

07:37.602 --> 07:38.691
I don't even know you.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.271
But you must've known Krupa.

07:40.272 --> 07:42.101
Here.

07:42.102 --> 07:45.271
I need to know if you hear from her.

07:46.522 --> 07:48.521
Okay, Garvin might be a good listener,

07:48.522 --> 07:50.561
but he's an even better stalker.

07:53.892 --> 07:55.601
Hold the phone, Finch.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.151
Think we just found our perp.

07:58.152 --> 07:59.941
He just broke into Krupa's apartment.

08:05.522 --> 08:07.811
Lower your weapon, nobody gets hurt.

08:11.732 --> 08:13.651
You were at the RTCC this morning.

08:13.652 --> 08:16.441
John Riley. Homicide.

08:16.442 --> 08:17.771
Took you long enough.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.347
It's a ShotSeeker alert.

08:38.347 --> 08:40.307
It just recognized those gunshots.

08:40.308 --> 08:43.017
Shots fired
near 607 West 126th Street.

08:43.018 --> 08:44.677
Unit 214, you are two blocks east.

08:44.678 --> 08:45.847
Scratch that, dispatch.

08:45.848 --> 08:47.637
This is John Riley, Homicide.

08:47.638 --> 08:50.557
I'm at the location
now. Suspect's in custody.

08:53.098 --> 08:55.517
What's going on with you, Garvin?

08:55.518 --> 08:57.727
Three nights ago at 2:00
a.m., ShotSeeker microphones

08:57.728 --> 09:00.517
picked up three loud pops
from inside this building.

09:00.518 --> 09:02.517
It was unmistakably
gunfire, but the program said

09:02.518 --> 09:03.677
that it was firecrackers.

09:03.678 --> 09:05.137
So, how many pills you pop

09:05.138 --> 09:07.387
before you unmistakably heard gunfire?

09:07.388 --> 09:11.017
Look, the woman who lives
here, grad student named Krupa Naik,

09:11.018 --> 09:12.677
she hasn't been seen for days.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.097
Official story says that she
went missing after setting off

09:15.098 --> 09:17.387
three M80s in her living
room, but the last time I checked,

09:17.388 --> 09:18.767
this ain't the fourth of July,

09:18.768 --> 09:21.557
and it's not something
PhD chemists do for fun.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.017
So you think she was shot.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.597
It was gunfire,

09:25.598 --> 09:26.677
and I can prove it.

09:26.678 --> 09:27.807
Hey.

09:27.808 --> 09:28.967
Easy now.

09:31.228 --> 09:32.405
Trust me.

09:38.228 --> 09:41.017
These are the M80
firecrackers that ShotSeeker picked up

09:41.018 --> 09:43.017
a half an hour ago.

09:43.018 --> 09:44.677
See how precise?

09:44.678 --> 09:47.637
ShotSeeker picked up the
sound, located it correctly,

09:47.638 --> 09:49.557
and identified it as firecrackers.

09:49.558 --> 09:52.637
Now here's what
ShotSeeker recorded three nights ago

09:52.638 --> 09:53.927
at Krupa's place.

09:55.138 --> 09:56.307
That's firecracker, right?

09:56.308 --> 09:57.999
Yeah, same sound, same waveform.

09:58.000 --> 09:58.677
Yeah.

09:58.678 --> 09:59.927
I could see why you would think that,

09:59.928 --> 10:02.387
but you see that spike?

10:02.388 --> 10:05.557
It's pressurized gas escaping
as the bullet exits the barrel.

10:05.558 --> 10:06.887
It's also called a muzzle blast.

10:06.888 --> 10:09.807
From a Ruger 22.

10:09.808 --> 10:12.347
How can you tell that?

10:12.348 --> 10:14.177
I can hear it.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.727
I was just born this way.

10:17.308 --> 10:19.485
And here's the Ruger that
you watched me unload

10:19.486 --> 10:20.767
into Krupa's fireplace.

10:20.768 --> 10:23.387
Now if we compare that
with the so-called firecrackers

10:23.388 --> 10:24.387
from the other night.

10:26.598 --> 10:28.597
- Identical.
- Yeah.

10:28.598 --> 10:30.767
Krupa disappeared after
three bullets were fired

10:30.768 --> 10:32.677
in her living room three nights ago.

10:32.678 --> 10:34.637
And no one seems to give a damn.

10:34.638 --> 10:38.557
Unless you feel inspired, Detective.

10:38.558 --> 10:39.927
Mary Mulhall.

10:39.928 --> 10:41.557
She's Krupa's neighbor and classmate.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.767
I think she knows
something but is too afraid to talk.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.967
I've hacked into
ShotSeeker from here, Mr. Reese,

10:47.968 --> 10:50.307
and while I can't claim
Mr. Garvin's sharp ears,

10:50.308 --> 10:52.387
I'm inclined to believe his case.

10:52.388 --> 10:54.967
He appears to have stumbled
on a possible murder.

10:54.968 --> 10:57.227
Whoever shot Krupa may
be targeting Garvin

10:57.228 --> 10:59.137
to scuttle his investigation.

11:01.638 --> 11:03.677
The best way to protect Ethan Garvin

11:03.678 --> 11:06.677
is to find out who's
responsible for Krupa's disappearance.

11:06.678 --> 11:09.387
Why don't you and Mr.
Garvin run down your first lead?

11:09.388 --> 11:12.637
An official missing
persons report for Krupa Naik

11:12.638 --> 11:15.557
was filed today by Benjamin Haas,

11:15.558 --> 11:19.307
president of an anti-hunger non-profit

11:19.308 --> 11:21.597
called Feed The Globe.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.927
Let's get going.

11:23.928 --> 11:25.677
Where to now?

11:25.678 --> 11:28.057
Hold on a second, partner.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.637
We got a problem.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.967
This guy Bruce Moran threatened my kid.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.807
He's Elias's closest ally.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.267
He's been underground for months.

11:35.268 --> 11:36.807
Yeah, well, he decided to get some sun.

11:36.808 --> 11:38.727
You know, it's one
thing to keep me in the dark,

11:38.728 --> 11:40.557
but it's something completely different

11:40.558 --> 11:41.807
to put my family at risk.

11:41.808 --> 11:44.347
Don't worry, I'll make it right.

11:44.348 --> 11:46.467
Tell him the truth.

11:46.468 --> 11:48.057
'Cause if you won't, I will.

11:48.058 --> 11:49.597
At least my end of it.

11:49.598 --> 11:53.267
I told you, I will handle it,

11:53.268 --> 11:55.927
but now, I need you to
work this missing persons case

11:55.928 --> 11:58.847
with my new friend Ethan Garvin.

12:03.638 --> 12:05.467
Another missing persons.

12:11.678 --> 12:13.637
All right, Ms. Groves.

12:13.638 --> 12:17.097
The miniature machine
clone is on this laptop.

12:17.098 --> 12:19.847
You know, for a man with
such serious concerns

12:19.848 --> 12:23.347
about the proliferation of artificial
super intelligence,

12:23.348 --> 12:26.467
you sure do love to build new ones.

12:30.678 --> 12:33.927
I can connect this Machine laptop
to the Samaritan laptop

12:33.928 --> 12:37.267
via this central computer, which
will function as a forum

12:37.268 --> 12:39.137
for their virtual engagement.

12:39.138 --> 12:42.097
Or a Roman Colosseum for
an unlimited series

12:42.098 --> 12:43.927
of virtual battles.

12:43.928 --> 12:47.637
If Samaritan has a fatal
flaw, we'll know it soon enough.

12:47.638 --> 12:49.927
This is what She wanted, Harold.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.017
Let the games begin.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.677
_

13:05.468 --> 13:06.467
It's working.

13:12.172 --> 13:14.234
_

13:22.228 --> 13:24.227
When's the last time you slept?

13:24.228 --> 13:26.387
Couple days. I don't know.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.677
- Not since Krupa went missing.
- I hear you.

13:28.678 --> 13:31.177
My last couple of missing person
cases hit a brick wall,

13:31.178 --> 13:32.887
but you got to take care of yourself.

13:35.968 --> 13:38.347
You know those guys?

13:38.348 --> 13:39.484
No.

13:41.558 --> 13:42.597
Why?

13:46.428 --> 13:47.637
That's weird.

13:51.228 --> 13:53.177
Americans throw out enough
food every year

13:53.178 --> 13:56.097
to fill 730 football stadiums.

13:56.098 --> 13:57.517
The world doesn't
have an abundance problem

13:57.518 --> 13:58.517
when it comes to food.

13:58.518 --> 14:00.097
It has a distribution problem.

14:00.098 --> 14:02.057
What's that have to do with
our Krupa Naik problem?

14:02.058 --> 14:05.427
Krupa developed a freeze-drying
process that would convert

14:05.428 --> 14:08.017
fresh produce to powder,
and extend its shelf life

14:08.018 --> 14:09.597
by two years.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.557
She was going to license her research
to us for a modest fee

14:12.558 --> 14:14.677
so we could feed millions,

14:14.678 --> 14:16.597
but someone didn't want us to have it.

14:16.598 --> 14:17.677
Who?

14:26.388 --> 14:29.677
I'm J.D. Carrick, CEO of Harvesta.

14:29.678 --> 14:31.807
J.D. Carrick offered Krupa a fortune

14:31.808 --> 14:33.677
to buy her research outright.

14:33.678 --> 14:35.097
And that's a bad thing how?

14:35.098 --> 14:37.517
Well, she said no, and then vanished.

14:37.518 --> 14:40.227
Harvesta opposition has
a habit of disappearing,

14:40.228 --> 14:43.637
including six farming
activists in Ecuador last month.

14:43.638 --> 14:45.017
Why do you think it was this guy?

14:45.018 --> 14:47.887
Well, Carrick got pretty
hostile during negotiations.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.267
Three days ago, Krupa
chose Feed The Globe

14:51.268 --> 14:52.637
over Harvesta,

14:52.638 --> 14:55.637
and that was the last
time anyone saw her.

14:55.638 --> 14:57.227
Then, about 2:00 a.m. that night...

14:57.228 --> 14:58.807
Same time Krupa went missing.

14:58.808 --> 15:02.767
Somebody hacked our company servers
and stole just one file.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.307
Let me guess.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.057
The one with Krupa's research on it.

15:06.058 --> 15:07.597
So, you think whoever stole that file

15:07.598 --> 15:09.057
is behind her disappearance.

15:09.058 --> 15:13.677
I know it, but my IT
guy can't trace the hack.

15:13.678 --> 15:16.677
Maybe my IT guy's better than yours.

15:37.348 --> 15:38.767
You've been underground for months,

15:38.768 --> 15:40.307
and you chose to resurface

15:40.308 --> 15:43.597
by threatening Detective Fusco's son.

15:43.598 --> 15:45.557
I thought you were
smarter than that, Bruce.

15:45.558 --> 15:47.347
It worked.

15:47.348 --> 15:49.677
I got your attention.

15:49.678 --> 15:51.137
I need you to listen to me.

15:52.928 --> 15:56.677
Go back underground and stay there
until you're ready to die.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.847
Carl Elias and Anthony
Marconi were my brothers

16:00.848 --> 16:04.807
since childhood, and I lost
them both within a matter of months.

16:04.808 --> 16:08.517
Anthony's death was suitably avenged.

16:08.518 --> 16:10.137
Elias saw to that.

16:10.138 --> 16:13.057
Elias's final chapter
has yet to be written.

16:15.153 --> 16:17.427
But I can't write it
until I know who killed him,

16:17.428 --> 16:18.967
which I think you do.

16:18.968 --> 16:21.267
That's not a question
you want the answer to.

16:21.268 --> 16:25.017
Whoever went after Elias
would kill you just for asking it,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.677
let alone seeking vengeance.

16:26.678 --> 16:29.057
I made my peace with that.

16:31.388 --> 16:33.727
Well, I'm sorry for your loss, Bruce,

16:33.728 --> 16:35.427
but that's what it is.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.637
A loss.

16:36.638 --> 16:40.467
You want to talk about loyalty?

16:40.468 --> 16:43.637
I'll kill you myself you
ever go near Fusco again.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.267
730 stadiums, that's a lot of leftovers.

16:58.228 --> 17:02.637
Multiple gunshots
fired at 64 West 21st Street.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.367
That's here.

17:04.368 --> 17:06.347
Multiple shots
fired at 64 West 21st Street.

17:06.348 --> 17:07.517
- There's no gunfire.
- All units respond.

17:07.518 --> 17:09.227
ShotSeeker must be wrong.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.227
Shooter is a male, 5'10",

17:11.228 --> 17:13.097
wearing a plaid
shirt and a black hoodie,

17:13.098 --> 17:15.227
and is considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

17:16.308 --> 17:17.358
That's you. Drop the phone.

17:17.359 --> 17:18.676
I'm calling the ShotSeeker tech.

17:18.678 --> 17:19.517
Drop your phone!

17:19.518 --> 17:20.676
What's happening?

17:20.678 --> 17:22.017
Drop the gun!

17:22.018 --> 17:23.267
It's not a gun! It's not a gun!

17:23.268 --> 17:24.676
I'm a cop! Don't shoot!

17:39.698 --> 17:41.697
Boy, you look more
strung out than usual.

17:41.698 --> 17:43.277
Yeah, four cops almost shot me.

17:43.278 --> 17:44.697
Yeah, and I almost took the bullets.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.607
Someone just tried to set
him up for a suicide by cop,

17:48.608 --> 17:50.527
and they used ShotSeeker to do it.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.647
I saw two guys in a van that
might be tracking us.

17:52.648 --> 17:54.487
Could be working for Harvesta.

17:54.488 --> 17:56.647
RTCC's trying to pull
up some visuals now.

17:56.648 --> 17:58.487
I've already checked, Detective.

17:58.488 --> 18:00.987
There are cameras
outside Feed The Globe,

18:00.988 --> 18:02.567
but that van

18:02.568 --> 18:04.567
was never in their sight.

18:04.568 --> 18:07.567
However, the anonymous phone call

18:07.568 --> 18:12.487
with Garvin's exact
description came from a nearby payphone,

18:12.488 --> 18:13.897
also off camera.

18:13.898 --> 18:15.567
Anonymous, huh?

18:15.568 --> 18:17.397
Send me the address.
I'll go check it out.

18:17.398 --> 18:19.197
That's interesting.

18:19.198 --> 18:22.487
Someone hacks Feed The
Globe to steal Krupa's research,

18:22.488 --> 18:24.527
and then ShotSeeker is hacked

18:24.528 --> 18:28.857
to orchestrate a suicide by cop.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.567
Ms. Groves and I will
follow the cyber trail.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.737
- Okay, I'll take Garvin to...
- Detective.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.277
Krupa's neighbor
from apartment 4E, Mary.

18:36.278 --> 18:37.697
She wants to meet.

18:37.698 --> 18:38.697
Very good.

18:38.698 --> 18:39.987
Keep me posted.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.397
No rest for the weary.

18:41.398 --> 18:42.647
Let's go.

18:42.648 --> 18:45.107
Hey, you settle that thing with Bruce?

18:45.108 --> 18:47.147
Well, settled's a stretch,

18:47.148 --> 18:49.197
but I got him off your back.

18:49.198 --> 18:50.697
Got to go, Lionel.

18:53.278 --> 18:56.567
I'll take ShotSeeker, you
look at Feed The Globe.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.107
Okay, Harry.

18:58.108 --> 19:00.107
Let's hack these hackers.

19:05.488 --> 19:08.277
How goes the ASI death match?

19:08.278 --> 19:10.027
Too soon to tell, I'm afraid.

19:13.818 --> 19:15.607
Is it?

19:17.568 --> 19:20.987
Even her replica's overmatched.

19:20.988 --> 19:26.027
Have you considered recoding
Her with a more defensive stance?

19:26.028 --> 19:27.487
You mean arm the Machine?

19:27.488 --> 19:29.607
More like equip Her with
the tools She needs

19:29.608 --> 19:31.777
to better protect herself.

19:31.778 --> 19:35.697
Self-preservation is a very
close cousin to aggression.

19:35.698 --> 19:39.277
A child, your child, needs
to learn to push back

19:39.278 --> 19:41.487
on the playground.

19:41.488 --> 19:44.777
That's not an instinct we
should hope to nurture

19:44.778 --> 19:48.647
in any artificial super intelligence.

19:48.648 --> 19:51.817
Not even one that we call our own.

19:51.818 --> 19:54.607
She's our only ally in this war.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.527
You need to learn to trust Her.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.147
But I do, Ms. Groves.

19:59.148 --> 20:01.937
The Machine is infinitely
smarter than either of us.

20:01.938 --> 20:06.027
If anyone here needs
to recode the Machine,

20:06.028 --> 20:07.737
it should be the Machine.

20:15.938 --> 20:17.607
Mary's late.

20:17.608 --> 20:20.277
Maybe she got scared.

20:20.278 --> 20:23.487
That's no way to live, Garvin.

20:23.488 --> 20:27.397
You're gonna run
yourself into the ground.

20:27.398 --> 20:29.697
You know, I must've
dispatched a thousand cops

20:29.698 --> 20:31.857
to a thousand different crime scenes.

20:31.858 --> 20:35.027
Every shooting victim never
more than just a name in a file,

20:35.028 --> 20:37.937
and then three nights ago,

20:37.938 --> 20:39.737
back from dispatch I heard the name

20:39.738 --> 20:41.987
like a shot from the past.

20:41.988 --> 20:44.437
Krupa Naik.

20:44.438 --> 20:47.567
Like, whoa. I know that name.

20:47.568 --> 20:50.647
First time on the job, you know?

20:50.648 --> 20:51.567
You knew her?

20:51.568 --> 20:54.607
No, I mean, we weren't friends.

20:54.608 --> 20:57.937
I knew who she was way
back in high school,

20:57.938 --> 21:01.885
and to be honest, I never
even really liked her.

21:02.029 --> 21:04.107
Got the best
grades, but I always thought

21:04.108 --> 21:05.709
she was kind of a kiss-ass.

21:06.038 --> 21:08.277
Turns out she's out there
changing the world

21:08.278 --> 21:11.607
while the rest of us are
wearing headphones,

21:11.608 --> 21:14.647
and now she's gone,

21:14.648 --> 21:16.487
and nobody cares.

21:16.488 --> 21:17.937
You care.

21:17.938 --> 21:21.857
Another missing
persons, three days gone.

21:21.858 --> 21:24.437
You know how this ends, don't you?

21:24.438 --> 21:26.857
No,

21:26.858 --> 21:28.527
and neither do you.

21:31.938 --> 21:33.237
Never lose that.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.697
I can't find any evidence that
ShotSeeker was ever hacked.

21:39.698 --> 21:42.697
It's possible we're looking
at this all wrong.

21:42.698 --> 21:44.647
Hmm. Not so fast, Harry.

21:44.648 --> 21:47.237
I just found
evidence of the cyber attack

21:47.238 --> 21:49.067
on Feed The Globe's servers.

21:49.068 --> 21:51.647
Thee nights ago at 2:00 a.m.

21:51.648 --> 21:53.237
Can you tell where it originated?

21:53.238 --> 21:57.647
Inside Harvesta on a
laptop belonging to its CEO,

21:57.648 --> 21:59.317
J.D. Carrick.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.817
There's the missing
research file right there.

22:01.818 --> 22:03.527
Looks like Carrick stole the file

22:03.528 --> 22:06.647
right before he had Krupa killed.

22:06.648 --> 22:08.027
Let's have a look.

22:12.528 --> 22:14.607
I can't seem to open it.

22:14.608 --> 22:17.117
That's some pretty wily encryption.

22:18.398 --> 22:21.647
Detective, any luck
locating that anonymous caller?

22:21.648 --> 22:24.317
Nah, nobody saw anything.

22:24.318 --> 22:26.237
By the way, this phone's out of order.

22:26.238 --> 22:28.567
That doesn't seem possible.

22:31.028 --> 22:32.647
Good for you. A phone that works.

22:32.648 --> 22:34.147
I'll call you back, Detective.

22:38.198 --> 22:40.987
Mr. Reese, have
you made contact with Mary yet?

22:40.988 --> 22:42.357
Not yet. Why?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.397
Were those shots fired, Finch?

22:46.568 --> 22:48.697
ShotSeeker pinpoints the noise

22:48.698 --> 22:52.527
to a university facilities
yard not far from the chemistry lab

22:52.528 --> 22:54.147
where Krupa and Mary work, but...

22:55.358 --> 22:56.567
Oh, that's odd.

22:56.568 --> 23:00.527
ShotSeeker says it's
car backfire, but...

23:02.778 --> 23:05.107
Those are definitely gunshots.

23:05.108 --> 23:06.647
It's another cover-up in progress.

23:06.648 --> 23:08.647
The police won't be alerted, Mr. Reese.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.607
You need to get there fast.

23:10.818 --> 23:12.527
The number. It's Mary.

23:14.778 --> 23:17.817
Detective Fusco, we have an emergency.

23:26.568 --> 23:28.527
I heard something up there.

23:36.568 --> 23:38.197
Please, help, please.

23:39.778 --> 23:41.258
We found Mary, Finch.

23:41.489 --> 23:42.697
We're gonna need an ambulance.

23:42.698 --> 23:44.107
I heard something.

23:44.108 --> 23:45.317
- He's still here.
- Get down now.

23:53.358 --> 23:54.607
You all right?

23:57.358 --> 23:59.777
What's your status, Mr. Reese?

23:59.778 --> 24:02.277
Fusco's here. I'm in pursuit now.

24:02.278 --> 24:04.567
Wait here for my partner.

24:10.608 --> 24:13.697
An ambulance is on the
way, Mary, but listen.

24:13.698 --> 24:15.607
We can still find Krupa.

24:15.608 --> 24:17.857
He knows.

24:17.858 --> 24:19.237
Knows? What?

24:19.238 --> 24:20.397
What does he know?

24:20.398 --> 24:21.397
He's... he's...

24:23.068 --> 24:26.397
The anonymous call
originated at a broken pay phone.

24:26.398 --> 24:29.527
The ShotSeeker hack is
real, but is completely invisible,

24:29.528 --> 24:31.697
and yes, Harvesta is the beneficiary

24:31.698 --> 24:35.777
of this conspiracy, but only
one entity is sophisticated enough

24:35.778 --> 24:37.527
to execute it.

24:39.108 --> 24:40.857
Samaritan.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.567
Proceed with caution, Mr. Reese.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.487
The shooter's with Samaritan.

24:44.488 --> 24:45.699
Got it.

24:56.488 --> 24:58.487
Suspect's moving east on 119th Street.

24:58.488 --> 25:01.397
Gray van. New York plates KDD-0327.

25:03.778 --> 25:04.987
Where's my partner?

25:10.488 --> 25:12.487
You can relax, Finch.

25:12.488 --> 25:13.937
He's gone.

25:18.608 --> 25:20.527
My boss wants to talk to you.

25:20.528 --> 25:22.317
Mr. Reese?

25:22.318 --> 25:23.487
Mr. Reese?

25:39.381 --> 25:41.170
Mary Mulhall is dead.

25:41.171 --> 25:43.470
My partner's gone and he's
not answering his phone.

25:43.471 --> 25:45.260
Any bright ideas, Finch?

25:45.261 --> 25:46.970
One moment please, Detective.

25:46.971 --> 25:49.300
I'm afraid Samaritan has John.

25:53.341 --> 25:56.170
Locate primary asset.

26:02.511 --> 26:04.340
Show me John Reese.

26:11.841 --> 26:14.010
Shaw's trail's cold,

26:14.011 --> 26:15.920
but John's isn't yet.

26:15.921 --> 26:18.800
We need a lead fast before
we lose him too.

26:18.801 --> 26:20.010
Sit tight, Detective.

26:20.011 --> 26:21.510
No way, glasses.

26:21.511 --> 26:23.170
I don't think so. My partner's missing.

26:23.171 --> 26:25.590
He's NYPD. Everybody listen up.

26:25.591 --> 26:28.210
I am Detective Lionel Fusco
from the Homicide Task Force.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.670
My partner, Detective John Riley,

26:29.671 --> 26:30.760
disappeared from this location

26:30.761 --> 26:32.510
22 minutes ago in pursuit

26:32.511 --> 26:34.340
of the pissant who killed this woman.

26:34.341 --> 26:35.760
One of ours is missing, guys,

26:35.761 --> 26:37.470
and we're gonna get him back.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.590
You, get on the RTCC

26:39.591 --> 26:41.050
and get a hit on that
gray van I called in.

26:41.051 --> 26:43.470
You, I want you to find J.D.
Carrick from Harvesta.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.055
Bring him to the 8th for questioning,

26:45.056 --> 26:46.130
and I want to talk to him.

26:46.131 --> 26:48.420
Everyone else, clock's
ticking. Let's go.

26:48.421 --> 26:50.420
Oh, dear, Detective
Fusco is running headlong

26:50.421 --> 26:52.510
into Samaritan's crosshairs.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.920
Detective, I understand your zeal,

26:54.921 --> 26:57.050
but I would urge you to use caution

26:57.051 --> 26:58.590
until we know what we're up against.

26:58.591 --> 27:00.010
See, that's the thing, Mr. Wizard.

27:00.011 --> 27:01.670
I think you know
exactly what we're up against,

27:01.671 --> 27:03.358
but you flat-out refuse to tell me.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.630
Detective Fusco, I assure you...

27:04.631 --> 27:06.010
Don't tell me you
haven't noticed that homicides

27:06.011 --> 27:07.340
are dropping, but suicides are up,

27:07.341 --> 27:09.210
and so are missing persons.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.210
There are people
disappearing all over this town.

27:11.211 --> 27:12.710
Now John's gone too.

27:12.711 --> 27:14.130
I am not gonna let this one lie.

27:14.131 --> 27:16.300
Not this time.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.840
Wonderful.

27:17.841 --> 27:19.630
Now we have to save
Mr. Reese from Samaritan

27:19.631 --> 27:21.920
and Detective Fusco from himself.

27:21.921 --> 27:23.880
John needs our help now.

27:23.881 --> 27:26.130
You have to give us
something to work with.

27:28.671 --> 27:30.210
Krupa gave me a hard drive.

27:30.211 --> 27:32.010
Where? Your apartment?

27:32.011 --> 27:34.260
If I tell you,
w-will I see her again?

27:34.261 --> 27:35.260
What do you think?

27:35.261 --> 27:36.260
Go to hell.

27:38.051 --> 27:40.010
We'll find it.

27:43.091 --> 27:46.210
That hard drive, it's our
best chance to get a lead on Reese.

27:46.211 --> 27:47.210
I'll come with you.

27:47.211 --> 27:48.210
No.

27:48.211 --> 27:50.670
I need you here more than ever.

27:50.671 --> 27:52.090
Don't worry.

27:52.091 --> 27:53.630
If there's trouble on the playground...

27:56.171 --> 27:57.880
I'll push first.

28:03.801 --> 28:07.210
Locate New York plates KDD-0327.

28:28.261 --> 28:29.800
Mary must've told them something.

28:29.801 --> 28:31.510
I think your heart's in
the right place, kid,

28:31.511 --> 28:33.170
but maybe you should
leave the police work

28:33.171 --> 28:36.090
to the real police, so no
one else gets hurt, huh?

28:37.261 --> 28:39.130
This is for your own good.

28:39.131 --> 28:41.470
Everywhere you go, a
bullet seems to follow.

28:43.761 --> 28:46.550
J.D. Carrick from Harvesta.

28:46.551 --> 28:48.260
Are you responsible for this?

28:48.261 --> 28:50.090
Detective Fusco, Homicide.

28:50.091 --> 28:51.470
Homicide?

28:51.471 --> 28:53.300
That's a big game badge, Detective.

28:53.301 --> 28:55.590
That's gonna look great
stuffed and mounted on my wall.

28:55.591 --> 28:57.300
Let's go, tough guy.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.260
Yeah, sit down.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.970
My partner's missing,

29:02.971 --> 29:04.630
and every minute I don't find him,

29:04.631 --> 29:06.260
your life's gonna get worse.

29:06.261 --> 29:09.420
I've got one dead
girl, another one missing,

29:09.421 --> 29:12.170
a cyber crime trail that
leads from Krupa's missing research

29:12.171 --> 29:14.210
directly back to your laptop.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.670
Krupa. Krupa Naik?

29:15.671 --> 29:16.760
Look, pal.

29:16.761 --> 29:18.010
You can help yourself out here

29:18.011 --> 29:20.210
by telling me where my partner is.

29:20.211 --> 29:22.300
Krupa Naik is an impressive chemist

29:22.301 --> 29:24.630
who chose to waste her
brilliant scientific innovation

29:24.631 --> 29:28.170
on delivering food to
starving Africans who insist on living

29:28.171 --> 29:30.760
where they can't
actually grow any food themselves.

29:30.761 --> 29:32.420
You'd be better off arresting
her for idiocy.

29:32.421 --> 29:34.260
Yeah, but I can't do
that because you've already

29:34.261 --> 29:36.760
murdered her for a business deal.

29:36.761 --> 29:38.880
Hang on.

29:38.881 --> 29:40.260
Krupa's dead?

29:40.261 --> 29:42.550
Hey, look, this stuff
might work in Ecuador,

29:42.551 --> 29:43.970
but this is New York City, pal.

29:43.971 --> 29:46.090
Exactly right, my
friend, this is New York,

29:46.091 --> 29:50.260
where guys like me have
lawyers for cops like you.

29:50.261 --> 29:53.340
You do your job and
go wake up my attorney.

30:00.261 --> 30:01.760
Let's try this again, big time.

30:11.324 --> 30:13.216
_

30:14.551 --> 30:17.260
I could use
some good news, Root.

30:17.261 --> 30:19.210
I wish I had some.

30:19.211 --> 30:21.470
Looks like
Samaritan's already been here.

30:22.801 --> 30:24.760
Wait.

30:24.761 --> 30:29.050
He's still here, but he
hasn't found the hard drive yet.

30:30.301 --> 30:32.210
Wish me luck, Harry.

30:32.211 --> 30:33.340
Ms. Groves?

30:37.881 --> 30:40.130
Please tell me you found Mr. Reese.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.380
You found the van.

30:42.381 --> 30:43.880
At the precinct.

30:46.631 --> 30:49.210
Detective Fusco, Mary's
killer is heading into

30:49.211 --> 30:51.210
the 8th precinct.

30:59.211 --> 31:02.260
Mary's too smart to
hide it in her things.

31:23.761 --> 31:25.260
Where is he? Where's Reese?

31:26.261 --> 31:27.261
Who?

31:31.471 --> 31:34.340
Welcome back to Brooklyn, John.

31:34.341 --> 31:36.420
This time we're gonna talk on my terms.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.706
Elias spoke well of you, John.

31:54.707 --> 31:56.246
You're a man of honor

31:56.247 --> 31:58.546
with impeccable training,
so it'd be doubly pointless

31:58.547 --> 32:01.206
to tie you up,

32:01.207 --> 32:03.916
but they'll shoot you if
you move from that chair.

32:03.917 --> 32:06.336
I'll keep that in mind.

32:06.337 --> 32:09.166
It's been four months
since Elias and Dominic

32:09.167 --> 32:11.046
were assassinated,

32:11.047 --> 32:12.956
along with at least four other kingpins.

32:12.957 --> 32:14.456
What four other kingpins?

32:14.457 --> 32:17.706
In Boston, Philly, Chicago.

32:17.707 --> 32:18.956
That mean something to you?

32:18.957 --> 32:21.996
I think it means crime doesn't pay.

32:26.207 --> 32:28.876
Four long months, I've
been lying in wait to retaliate

32:28.877 --> 32:31.586
against whomever rose
up to fill the void.

32:31.587 --> 32:34.286
And nobody rose up, and
I'm tired of waiting.

32:34.287 --> 32:35.956
I think you know who killed Elias,

32:35.957 --> 32:37.706
and I'd like for you to tell me who.

32:39.587 --> 32:41.916
I know you.

32:41.917 --> 32:43.456
Never forget a face.

32:43.457 --> 32:45.741
Maybe you have me
confused with the last guy

32:45.742 --> 32:46.666
you held at gunpoint.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.996
If you don't tell me where Reese is,

32:48.997 --> 32:51.246
I'm gonna do more than just point.

32:51.247 --> 32:52.836
Don't know, don't care,

32:52.837 --> 32:56.206
but I can't let you
leave with that hard drive.

32:56.207 --> 32:57.626
Why?

32:57.627 --> 32:58.786
What's on it?

32:58.787 --> 33:00.126
All I know is it's dangerous,

33:00.127 --> 33:01.956
and my boss is paying good money for it.

33:01.957 --> 33:04.916
On top of murdering the
poor woman who lived here.

33:07.337 --> 33:09.166
I don't know anything about that.

33:12.167 --> 33:14.916
Tell me where Samaritan's taken Reese.

33:14.917 --> 33:16.126
Samaritan?

33:17.667 --> 33:19.786
You really don't know.

33:19.787 --> 33:23.586
You're just a cog in a wheel
you can't possibly comprehend.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.836
You don't know a damn thing about me.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.546
You just know this:

33:28.547 --> 33:29.836
I'm not going back to jail.

33:29.837 --> 33:32.336
You can forget about the drive too.

33:34.997 --> 33:36.876
Agree to disagree?

33:39.457 --> 33:42.876
You work for an
organization called Samaritan.

33:42.877 --> 33:46.956
They may have convinced you
of their own good intentions,

33:46.957 --> 33:49.916
but believe me, they're lying.

34:09.206 --> 34:11.126
Detective Fusco!

34:14.587 --> 34:15.666
You need something, kid?

34:17.456 --> 34:19.956
Don't move. Hands behind your back.

34:27.746 --> 34:29.996
You're gonna be okay, kid.

34:31.996 --> 34:34.045
Still no word from John.

34:34.047 --> 34:35.545
The guy they sent was a runner.

34:35.547 --> 34:38.166
He didn't know anything,

34:38.167 --> 34:39.956
but we know him.

34:43.127 --> 34:45.456
It's Jeff Blackwell.

34:45.456 --> 34:47.545
He was a number.

34:47.547 --> 34:48.835
One we dismissed.

34:48.837 --> 34:51.545
Guess She was right after all.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.545
He's off the grid doing
Samaritan's bidding now.

34:54.547 --> 34:56.786
Got a feeling we
haven't seen the last of him.

34:57.957 --> 34:59.336
How's our twitchy tech?

34:59.337 --> 35:01.246
Detective Fusco stopped one assassin,

35:01.247 --> 35:03.626
but Samaritan will
just keep sending more.

35:03.627 --> 35:05.815
And we can't put a stop
to it until we understand

35:05.816 --> 35:07.666
why Garvin's
targeted in the first place.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.836
Oh, maybe this will help.

35:09.837 --> 35:12.836
Blackwell said
Samaritan thinks it's dangerous.

35:20.957 --> 35:24.126
It's a backup of Krupa's research.

35:24.127 --> 35:27.546
You saw this exact
file on Carrick's computer

35:27.547 --> 35:28.706
earlier today, didn't you?

35:28.707 --> 35:31.086
I couldn't open it, remember?

35:31.087 --> 35:33.046
Wily encryption.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.046
That's interesting. May I?

35:35.047 --> 35:36.046
Yeah.

35:41.627 --> 35:44.916
Samaritan has encrypted
the file so that no human

35:44.917 --> 35:46.496
can ever open it.

35:46.497 --> 35:47.546
It's a decoy, Ms. Groves.

35:47.547 --> 35:48.996
A fake.

35:48.997 --> 35:52.286
Samaritan planted this
decoy on Carrick's computer

35:52.287 --> 35:54.126
to frame him for Krupa's murder.

35:54.127 --> 35:57.666
How adorably ruthless and elaborate.

35:57.667 --> 36:00.626
Carrick has done this sort
of thing before in Ecuador,

36:00.627 --> 36:04.746
so it's more than easy
to assume he did it here.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.086
Good work, Harry.

36:07.587 --> 36:10.126
But how do we save Ethan Garvin's life?

36:10.127 --> 36:13.166
Let's assume that
Samaritan is targeting Garvin

36:13.167 --> 36:16.046
because his
investigation threatens to unearth

36:16.047 --> 36:18.786
a copy of Krupa's research.

36:18.787 --> 36:21.206
Which is exactly what happened.

36:21.207 --> 36:25.546
By that logic, if we
disseminate the research now,

36:25.547 --> 36:27.376
Garvin ceases to be a threat.

36:27.377 --> 36:30.586
The danger that he represents
would've already come to pass.

36:30.587 --> 36:34.126
I can upload it to 15
online science journals right now.

36:34.127 --> 36:37.956
You could, but should we?

36:37.957 --> 36:40.996
Why does Samaritan want to
bury that research so badly?

36:40.997 --> 36:44.496
Could solving world hunger
lead to an overpopulation problem?

36:44.497 --> 36:47.876
We can't pretend to
understand Samaritan's motivations.

36:47.877 --> 36:51.086
For all we know, it did all of
this just to assume control

36:51.087 --> 36:53.286
of the global food supply,

36:53.287 --> 36:56.496
but what we do know is
we can save a life today

36:56.497 --> 36:59.916
by doing the opposite of
what Samaritan wants.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.046
All I have to do is hit this button.

37:04.377 --> 37:05.496
Do it.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.836
Did it work?

37:28.837 --> 37:31.456
We'll know soon enough.

37:34.207 --> 37:36.916
I'll tell you what you want to know,

37:36.917 --> 37:40.046
but these men need to leave the room.

37:40.047 --> 37:42.206
I'm not gonna put
their lives at risk too.

37:42.207 --> 37:44.416
These men are Elias's men.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.996
They were loyal to Elias.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.876
They're every bit as
invested in my mission.

37:50.837 --> 37:52.836
In that case, I'm leaving now,

37:52.837 --> 37:55.456
but first I got to find my cell phone.

37:56.877 --> 37:58.836
Oh, come on, fellas.

37:58.837 --> 38:00.746
I thought we were men of honor.

38:00.747 --> 38:02.166
I can't control them, John.

38:02.167 --> 38:03.166
Yeah.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.456
Good.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.916
Now we can talk.

38:15.917 --> 38:18.786
We saved a life today, but at what cost?

38:23.127 --> 38:26.086
John? Hello?

38:26.087 --> 38:27.286
Are you okay?

38:27.287 --> 38:29.496
I'm with Bruce.

38:29.497 --> 38:31.746
He wants the truth.

38:31.747 --> 38:34.456
Won't take no for an answer.

38:34.457 --> 38:35.916
I understand.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.126
30 minutes.

38:40.247 --> 38:42.876
Hmm.

38:42.877 --> 38:44.246
I guess we can take Helper Monkey

38:44.247 --> 38:46.746
off the endangered species list.

38:46.747 --> 38:49.086
For now at least.

38:49.087 --> 38:51.456
Chin up, Harry.

38:51.457 --> 38:54.996
Our path to victory will
reveal itself soon enough.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.126
Let's hope you're right.

39:05.047 --> 39:06.586
You did good, Garvin.

39:06.587 --> 39:08.456
We got two guys in
custody thanks to you.

39:08.457 --> 39:11.336
Krupa's still missing. Mary's dead.

39:11.337 --> 39:12.876
Yeah, we did the best we could.

39:12.877 --> 39:14.786
It wasn't enough.

39:14.787 --> 39:17.456
Hey, it never is.

39:17.457 --> 39:20.046
That's the curse of what we
do, and why we never stop.

39:20.047 --> 39:21.836
I'm not giving up on Krupa.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.206
She's not alone among the missing.

39:24.207 --> 39:26.044
Thanks, Detective.

39:26.176 --> 39:27.916
Go home and get some sleep.

39:29.247 --> 39:31.956
Hey, and get yourself a razor, will you?

39:53.247 --> 39:55.786
Hello, old friend.

39:55.787 --> 39:57.376
Carl?

39:57.377 --> 39:59.836
I apologize for not contacting
you sooner,

39:59.837 --> 40:01.270
but it was for your own good.

40:01.272 --> 40:02.416
How so?

40:02.417 --> 40:04.786
I knew you'd take vengeance, Bruce.

40:04.787 --> 40:07.456
Would surely get you killed.

40:07.457 --> 40:10.786
They said you burned
up in that transport van.

40:10.787 --> 40:13.956
Detective Fusco took
a big risk that night.

40:13.957 --> 40:15.206
He got me here.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.996
John and Harold brought
me back from the brink.

40:17.997 --> 40:22.046
Speaking of the good
detective, he's worried about you, John.

40:22.047 --> 40:23.295
We all were.

40:25.247 --> 40:27.456
I'm telling you, this guy
knows something about Riley.

40:32.547 --> 40:34.956
- Yeah.
- Hey, Lionel.

40:34.957 --> 40:36.246
Hey, buddy, you okay? Where are you?

40:36.247 --> 40:39.166
I'm with Bruce at the safe house.

40:39.167 --> 40:41.046
He's not gonna bother you anymore.

40:41.047 --> 40:43.956
As long as you're okay.

40:43.957 --> 40:45.376
Listen, Lionel,

40:45.377 --> 40:48.666
you stuck your neck out for me,

40:48.667 --> 40:51.046
and we appreciate it.

40:51.047 --> 40:52.786
Thank you.

40:52.787 --> 40:53.996
From all of us.

40:53.997 --> 40:56.996
Yeah, sure.

40:56.997 --> 40:59.376
As long as you know I'm
not done asking questions.

40:59.377 --> 41:01.336
I don't even think the CEO's guilty.

41:01.337 --> 41:02.706
He thinks he got framed
up, and guess what.

41:02.707 --> 41:03.746
So do I.

41:03.747 --> 41:05.791
Can we pick this up tomorrow?

41:05.911 --> 41:06.496
No, we can't.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.956
There's something
strange going on right now,

41:07.957 --> 41:09.046
and I'm gonna investigate it

41:09.047 --> 41:10.626
with or without the nerd herd.

41:12.747 --> 41:15.336
Who did this to you?

41:15.337 --> 41:16.746
There's a new player out there.

41:16.747 --> 41:19.546
An adversary that we can't beat,

41:19.547 --> 41:22.086
and one we best not try and fight.

41:22.087 --> 41:24.286
What are you even talking about?

41:24.287 --> 41:26.496
We always faced our enemies head on.

41:26.497 --> 41:27.876
We built a whole world that way.

41:27.877 --> 41:29.666
Me, you, Anthony.

41:29.667 --> 41:32.746
There's no room for
guys like us anymore,

41:32.747 --> 41:36.876
and you always
understood the value of the shadows.

41:36.877 --> 41:39.746
Well, I don't have that luxury anymore.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.546
With you gone, someone's got to
step up and handle the business,

41:42.547 --> 41:45.456
lest we lost everything we created.

41:45.457 --> 41:48.706
Go back to the shadows, Bruce.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.746
Embrace them fully.

41:50.747 --> 41:52.126
We all must.

41:53.247 --> 41:54.876
I won't give up that easily.

41:54.877 --> 41:57.836
You know me better than that.

41:57.837 --> 41:59.126
Take care of yourself.

42:10.957 --> 42:11.956
Harold.

42:13.787 --> 42:15.166
What's the word from the subway?

42:15.167 --> 42:17.126
Are the simulations up and running?

42:19.377 --> 42:24.416
There have been over 10
billion scenarios so far,

42:24.417 --> 42:26.996
and I'm sorry to say,

42:26.997 --> 42:30.086
the Machine is struggling.

42:30.087 --> 42:32.086
So how bad?

42:32.087 --> 42:33.916
She's lost every one, John.

42:36.917 --> 42:39.206
I'm afraid we're
fighting a war we can't win.

43:06.587 --> 43:09.376
Spare some change, brother?

43:09.377 --> 43:11.916
Spare come change, brother?
