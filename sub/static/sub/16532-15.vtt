Didn't I just say it's not you?

07:28.989 --> 07:30.092
[Chuckles]

07:30.117 --> 07:32.177
- Isn't it, though?
- What?

07:32.202 --> 07:35.136
"Old people die, get over it"?

07:35.177 --> 07:36.605
That was, like, 20 minutes ago.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.774
- Okay, now, hang on a second.
- Okay, this seems like a whole thing,

07:38.799 --> 07:40.253
so I'm just gonna go
grab a water real quick.

07:40.278 --> 07:41.710
- [Claire sighs]
- Oh, come on.

07:43.576 --> 07:45.326
- Who are you texting?
- Ahh! No one.

07:45.351 --> 07:46.537
I'm just reading my horoscope.

07:46.562 --> 07:48.685
Liar. Why would anyone read their
horoscope so late in the day?

07:48.710 --> 07:50.218
Everything's already happened.

07:50.321 --> 07:52.404
- There's a dude, isn't there?
- What? No.

07:52.429 --> 07:54.787
Sneaking off with your
phone, the clean hair,

07:54.812 --> 07:57.091
your one bra that
fits properly... spill.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.256
[Scoffs] Okay, fine.

07:58.281 --> 07:59.599
There is a dude.

07:59.624 --> 08:01.474
Oh, God, it's not another
high-school boy, is it?

08:01.499 --> 08:02.545
No. He's legal.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.402
He's just embarrassing
in a different way.

08:04.427 --> 08:06.144
You know you've been like
this your whole life...

08:06.169 --> 08:08.937
ashamed of the romantic,
sexual part of you.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.738
Honestly, it seems like you
think you don't deserve it,

08:10.763 --> 08:11.795
but you do.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.620
And if this guy is fun and good to you

08:13.645 --> 08:15.405
and doesn't ride a scooter,

08:15.613 --> 08:17.071
let it be okay.

08:17.305 --> 08:18.478
Haley.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.209
Thanks. [Chuckles]

08:20.273 --> 08:22.072
Manny: Ladies, I don't
know what emotional thing

08:22.097 --> 08:23.107
is playing out right now,

08:23.132 --> 08:24.697
but how about you
save it for over there?

08:24.817 --> 08:27.017
And then I sent you the cutest video

08:27.042 --> 08:29.422
of a puppy nursing on a mama lion,

08:29.447 --> 08:30.912
and what do you text back?

08:30.957 --> 08:32.259
"She's getting him fat

08:32.284 --> 08:34.208
so that he tastes better at lunch"?

08:34.234 --> 08:36.506
Yeah, so what? My
crime is I'm hilarious?

08:36.532 --> 08:38.267
Can we get back to this, please?

08:38.292 --> 08:39.842
Kate just said she couldn't believe

08:39.866 --> 08:42.046
her father didn't die sooner, then...

08:42.071 --> 08:44.881
"The Widow Dubois slumps
in a chair, emotional."

08:44.906 --> 08:47.232
[Bad French accent] "Ohh, ma chérie,

08:47.257 --> 08:50.158
"your papa would be
devastated to hear you say

08:50.183 --> 08:52.216
"such insensitive things."

08:52.524 --> 08:53.523
Really?

08:53.548 --> 08:56.392
Are you gonna do the whole accent thing?

08:57.332 --> 08:59.167
Lo and behold...

08:59.353 --> 09:00.890
what do we see?

09:01.091 --> 09:03.145
The queen of spades is gone!

09:03.170 --> 09:04.634
Where could she be?

09:04.659 --> 09:07.005
In Frank's pocket. I
saw you put it there.

09:07.858 --> 09:09.424
So it is!

09:09.577 --> 09:11.197
Great trick, Phil.

09:11.222 --> 09:12.578
And nice assist, Ray.

09:12.603 --> 09:15.111
I thought this was supposed
to be a bachelor party.

09:15.136 --> 09:17.253
Where's the female entertainment?

09:17.278 --> 09:19.544
Oh, don't you worry about that.

09:19.604 --> 09:21.976

Calling time of death.

09:36.721 --> 09:37.763
Oh, not you ladies.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.521
You're still very vital, of course.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.545
Hey, we really appreciate

09:40.570 --> 09:42.522
all the riveting you did during the war.

09:42.547 --> 09:44.014
Dad was enjoying them.

09:44.039 --> 09:45.739
Just as well. [Laughs]

09:45.764 --> 09:46.930
I'm about to be married.

09:46.955 --> 09:48.024
I don't need to be tempted

09:48.049 --> 09:49.938
by all those bum, bum, bums.

09:49.963 --> 09:52.180
Oh, is that it for
the planned activities?

09:52.205 --> 09:53.760
No, we're just getting started.

09:53.785 --> 09:56.551
For the next hour, it's
a $5 buy-in game of Uno,

09:56.576 --> 09:58.799
then downstairs to Captain Scupper's,

09:58.824 --> 10:00.655
the best oysters in the desert.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.783
And finally, put on
your neckties, gentlemen,

10:02.808 --> 10:04.496
'cause I have four balcony seats...

10:04.521 --> 10:06.267
to Mr. Neil...

10:06.292 --> 10:08.403
- Please say "Diamond."
- ... Sedaka.

10:08.428 --> 10:09.687
What a night!

10:09.712 --> 10:11.278
Oh, we need some ice.

10:11.303 --> 10:12.703
I'll be right back.

10:12.728 --> 10:13.760
What the hell's Uno?

10:13.785 --> 10:15.986
Sort of a thinking man's Crazy Eights.

10:16.011 --> 10:17.849
Instead of playing cards up here,

10:17.874 --> 10:20.030
there is a casino downstairs

10:20.055 --> 10:21.579
with actual big-boy drinks.

10:21.604 --> 10:22.965
I'm right behind him.

10:23.059 --> 10:24.730
We'll grab Phil on the way.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.374
Or wouldn't it be fun for him...

10:27.399 --> 10:29.124
to try and find us?

10:29.149 --> 10:31.351
Frank: Oh, he'll love that!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.382
- [Pins clatter]
- Hey, Louise,

10:33.414 --> 10:34.846
I just saw that psycho imposter clown

10:34.871 --> 10:36.833
out by the dumpster giving
me threatening looks.

10:36.858 --> 10:38.424
- Look, Flouncy...
- It's Fizbo.

10:38.449 --> 10:39.582
I'm talking to you.

10:39.607 --> 10:42.040
I don't have time for
your clown nonsense.

10:42.065 --> 10:43.708
We've got a championship to win.

10:43.733 --> 10:45.863
I'm gonna go warm up
with the Pindigo Girls.

10:46.942 --> 10:49.042
Why does this have
to be happening today?

10:49.550 --> 10:50.820
Mitchell,

10:50.845 --> 10:53.424
maybe it's happening <i>because</i> it's today.

10:53.521 --> 10:55.748
Maybe somebody is
trying to get in my head

10:55.773 --> 10:57.172
to throw me off my game.

10:57.197 --> 10:59.130
Oh, honey, do you really
think people care enough to...

10:59.155 --> 11:01.750
Hey, you know what, there are
six people just in my eyesight

11:01.775 --> 11:03.816
that would do anything to
break my winning streak.

11:03.841 --> 11:05.908
For instance, Martin.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.561
He's never forgiven
me for making him feel

11:08.586 --> 11:09.719
like your father was in love with him.

11:09.744 --> 11:10.743
Okay, it couldn't have been Martin.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.816
We saw him, like, three seconds
before you thought that you saw Fiz...

11:12.841 --> 11:13.873
- Actually saw.
- Okay.

11:13.898 --> 11:14.909
And what's this about my dad?

11:14.934 --> 11:16.368
Fine. It's not Martin.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.696
But it certainly could be Señor Kaplan.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.801
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis.

11:22.309 --> 11:24.159
Hola, Señor Kaplan.

11:24.228 --> 11:25.968
If you're here to talk
trash, I'm not interested.

11:25.993 --> 11:27.010
Where were you 20 minutes ago,

11:27.035 --> 11:28.663
and can anybody account
for your whereabouts?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.855
Not that it's any of your business,

11:29.880 --> 11:32.270
but I happened to be in the
photo booth taking some solos.

11:32.371 --> 11:34.104
I'm gonna use number
three for my new passport.

11:34.129 --> 11:35.981
I would use number two.
There's a twinkle in your eye.

11:36.006 --> 11:37.238
But I have a different theory

11:37.263 --> 11:38.562
as to where you were 20 minutes ago,

11:38.587 --> 11:41.016
and it would have given
you exactly enough time

11:41.041 --> 11:43.854
to change out of a clown
costume into your bowling outf...

11:43.880 --> 11:45.111
[Screams]

11:46.081 --> 11:47.358
- What's wrong?
- Wha... No. No, no.

11:47.383 --> 11:48.750
I just saw... I just saw Fi... Fizbo

11:48.818 --> 11:50.053
in... in... in the mirror.

11:50.078 --> 11:51.663
I don't know what's
going on with you, Tucker,

11:51.688 --> 11:53.379
but in my culture, we like to call it...

11:53.404 --> 11:55.338
<i>loco en la cabeza.</i>

11:55.363 --> 11:57.454
Okay, you know what? Knock
it off. You're Canadian.

11:58.907 --> 12:00.978
"You all seem to forget I'm not alone.

12:01.003 --> 12:02.376
"I have Albert.

12:02.401 --> 12:04.071
"You can search the
world, and I defy you

12:04.096 --> 12:06.674
"to find a more devoted, loving...

12:07.351 --> 12:08.449
"parrot."

12:08.474 --> 12:10.373
"I used to like talking to Albert,

12:10.398 --> 12:12.683
"but then we got into
a fight over a cracker."

12:12.708 --> 12:15.002
"Kate whispers to Bailey
as they watch the Widow

12:15.027 --> 12:17.026
"sadly plunking notes on the piano."

12:17.051 --> 12:19.194
"How long do we have to stay with her?

12:19.219 --> 12:21.076
"We can leave now, right?"

12:21.101 --> 12:22.803
Gloria: [Bad French accent]
"I knew when your papa died,

12:22.828 --> 12:24.793
"I would never see you again."

12:24.818 --> 12:26.876
[Sighs] "No matter what I do,

12:26.901 --> 12:28.510
"you refuse to accept

12:28.555 --> 12:30.643
"that I accepted you."

"I'm just so emotional today."

12:35.039 --> 12:36.806
"But of course you are, Chloe.

12:36.831 --> 12:40.106
"And I'm sorry if I made
you feel like an outsider."

12:40.131 --> 12:43.078
"I love you, you know? <i>Je t'aime."</i>

12:43.327 --> 12:44.766
"I love you, too."

12:44.935 --> 12:45.982
[Voice breaking] Black out.

12:46.050 --> 12:47.716
[Normal voice] Bravo! Bravo!

12:47.741 --> 12:48.790
Really, Manny?

12:48.815 --> 12:51.397
My character gets into a fight
with a parrot over a cracker?

12:51.422 --> 12:53.191
[Hushed] I told you
that story in confidence.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.007
And for the record...

12:55.639 --> 12:57.873
I am nothing like my character.

12:57.898 --> 12:58.937
I'm not lonely at all.

12:58.962 --> 13:00.275
I have tons of options.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.530
I'm actually going to see one right now.

13:01.555 --> 13:02.611
And thanks to Haley,

13:02.636 --> 13:03.976
I'm no longer ashamed
of talking about him.

13:04.027 --> 13:05.451
Ooh! Who is it?

13:05.476 --> 13:06.512
- No one.
- What's his name?

13:06.537 --> 13:07.802
- Nothing.
- But...

13:07.871 --> 13:09.214
Well, if that's it for the feedback...

13:09.239 --> 13:10.939
- No, actually...
- Oh. Yay.

13:11.008 --> 13:14.259
... for me, the ending
felt a little trite.

13:14.284 --> 13:15.644
There's a lot of good stuff in there,

13:15.712 --> 13:17.879
but the whole "I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

13:17.904 --> 13:19.532
"I love you, I love you"... I just...

13:19.662 --> 13:21.844
I think women are more
complicated than that.

13:21.973 --> 13:23.518
Don't listen to her, Manny.

13:23.587 --> 13:24.818
The ending was beautiful.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.078
It's just that some
women have a hard time

13:27.103 --> 13:28.849
expressing their feelings.

13:28.874 --> 13:29.890
Oh, this again?

13:29.915 --> 13:32.800
- Gloria, I'm a very feeling person.
- Oh, really?

13:32.825 --> 13:35.540
From the woman that
writes in my birthday cards

13:35.565 --> 13:37.065
"Best, Claire."

13:37.090 --> 13:38.166
How is that not warm?

13:38.191 --> 13:40.368
I am wishing you quite
literally the best.

13:40.437 --> 13:41.969
I am a person in your family.

13:41.994 --> 13:44.715
I am not the woman
that does your eyebrows.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.052
Why would I send her a birthday card?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.439
The question is...

13:48.464 --> 13:51.120
why can't you write "Love, Claire"?

13:51.145 --> 13:52.813
I write "Love, Gloria."

13:52.848 --> 13:56.083
- [Sighs]
- I even dot the "I" with a huge heart.

13:56.151 --> 13:58.918
I tell you that I love
you, and you say "Me, too."

13:58.943 --> 14:01.065
Why? Why can't you tell
me that you love me?

14:01.090 --> 14:03.022
I don't know why I
can't tell you that I...

14:03.092 --> 14:04.791
There was a time when I wanted to,

14:04.826 --> 14:07.327
and then the moment
passed and time went by

14:07.396 --> 14:09.262
and then it just felt forced.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.970
You... you say it all the time.

14:10.995 --> 14:12.709
One could argue that dilutes it.

14:12.734 --> 14:13.800
Oh, so now it's my fault?

14:13.902 --> 14:14.960
I am lashing out at you

14:14.985 --> 14:17.030
because this is not the first time...

14:17.072 --> 14:18.821
I've been accused of this.

14:18.846 --> 14:22.010
I am sorry I haven't
said it before, Gloria.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.306
I love you.

14:23.886 --> 14:25.111
I love you.

14:25.179 --> 14:26.737
- Mm.
- Okay.

14:27.315 --> 14:28.645
My God, you're right.

14:28.670 --> 14:29.986
It is trite.

14:31.627 --> 14:33.193
- You got this, Sam!
- Come on.

14:33.387 --> 14:34.471
Come on!

14:34.496 --> 14:36.899
You on the other hand... you
throw one more gutter ball,

14:36.924 --> 14:39.576
and I will literally
frame you for murder.

14:39.985 --> 14:41.180
- No pressure.
- [Pins clatter]

14:41.212 --> 14:43.246
[Cheers and applause]

14:48.805 --> 14:49.804
Mwah!

14:50.170 --> 14:51.939
I wonder what that's about.

14:52.435 --> 14:53.505
Oh! Shh, shh, shh!

14:53.607 --> 14:55.411
- [Mockingly] Shh, shh, shh!
- Hmm.

14:55.575 --> 14:57.142
You two seem awfully chummy.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.376
Well, if by "chummy," you mean,

14:58.411 --> 15:01.179
"in the throes of an
electric sexual relationship,"

15:01.281 --> 15:04.133
then, yes, you bet your
bowling balls we're chummy.

15:04.158 --> 15:05.251
[Groans]

15:06.986 --> 15:08.853
Oh, my gosh.

15:08.921 --> 15:10.488
I just put it all together.

15:10.550 --> 15:12.288
- You're both Fizbo.
- [Groans]

15:12.320 --> 15:13.328
When I'm with one of you,

15:13.360 --> 15:15.610
the other's wearing the costume,
creating the perfect alibi.

15:15.635 --> 15:16.961
Light-bulb moment!

15:16.986 --> 15:17.995
This clown thing again.

15:18.064 --> 15:20.297
Look, Tucker, if I
wanted to get back at you

15:20.332 --> 15:22.101
for, oh, I don't know,
say something like

15:22.126 --> 15:24.100
setting me up with your
straight father-in-law,

15:24.125 --> 15:26.925
I certainly wouldn't do it by
stealing your stupid Bozo suit.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.235
- It's Fizbo.
- Way to take the high road, sweetie.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.724
First, I'd hack your e-mails,

15:32.046 --> 15:34.837
then I'd create several
fake social-media accounts,

15:34.862 --> 15:37.295
which I would use to mount the
multi-pronged smear campaign

15:37.320 --> 15:39.720
to drive a wedge between
you and everything you love.

15:40.042 --> 15:41.341
Wow. [Chuckles]

15:41.366 --> 15:43.293
That's maybe a bit of a red flag.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.468
And then I'd get several
credit cards in your name

15:45.493 --> 15:47.760
and then embark on a
massive identity-theft scheme

15:47.785 --> 15:49.218
that would leave you bankrupt

15:49.270 --> 15:51.061
and, with any luck at all,
facing criminal charges.

15:51.085 --> 15:52.403
- That's what I'd do.
- Okay.

15:52.428 --> 15:54.129
She's a bit of a handful, huh?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.514
You know, I was thinking,
maybe we should take a beat

15:55.539 --> 15:56.737
on meeting your parents this weekend.

15:56.762 --> 15:57.870
What do you say? All right.

15:58.554 --> 15:59.576
What?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.927
Bravo!

16:01.952 --> 16:03.404
Bravo.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.965
If you think your little
over-the-top revenge monologue

16:07.001 --> 16:09.530
is gonna throw me off your scent,

16:09.719 --> 16:11.803
then you are sorely mistaken.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.506
Now open your bag.

16:14.608 --> 16:16.289
- What?
- All of you,

16:16.314 --> 16:17.701
open your bags!

16:17.726 --> 16:19.316
You don't have... Cam, you got to stop.

16:19.341 --> 16:20.409
- Open them!
- Hey, hey!

16:20.434 --> 16:21.823
You're paranoid. You are paranoid.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.606
No one is dressing up...

16:23.956 --> 16:25.322
Oh, damn it, I hate
it when you're right.

16:25.347 --> 16:26.881
What... Oh! There he is!

16:26.906 --> 16:28.463
Chase him! Get him!

16:28.821 --> 16:29.935
Stop!

16:29.960 --> 16:31.145
Imposter!

16:31.170 --> 16:32.182
[Grunts]

16:32.937 --> 16:34.038
- Oh.
- Close your door, ma'am!

16:34.063 --> 16:36.088
- We're in pursuit! Thank you!
- Okay, okay, okay.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.738
[Sighs] Okay.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.491
[Breathing heavily]

16:40.724 --> 16:42.358
- We lost him.
- Wait. His mask.

16:42.383 --> 16:43.395
[Sniffs]

16:43.420 --> 16:45.620
- It smells like beer and cheese fires.
- Oh, Mitchell,

16:45.645 --> 16:46.935
- that's good investigative work.
- Yes.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.760
You've narrowed it down to
everyone in the bowling alley.

16:57.123 --> 16:58.277
Uno.

16:58.302 --> 17:00.346
[Laughter]

17:00.372 --> 17:01.375
There you are.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.133
We've been looking all over for you.

17:03.158 --> 17:05.791
Did you check in here, in
the room where the party is?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.916
Don't worry. We didn't forget about you.

17:08.387 --> 17:10.008
- Boop.
- I hope it was worth it.

17:10.032 --> 17:11.883
We missed our reservation
to Captain Scupper's.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.306
Don't worry, Phil. We ate.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.646
Pit boss sent some shrimp
cocktails over to our craps table.

17:15.671 --> 17:17.709
Along with some regular
cocktails, am I right?

17:17.733 --> 17:18.744
Yeah!

17:18.770 --> 17:20.034
[Both laugh]

17:20.059 --> 17:21.659
You... you had to be there.

17:21.684 --> 17:23.082
I get it. You had shrimp and drinks.

17:23.107 --> 17:24.483
Now, if it's not too much trouble,

17:24.508 --> 17:25.723
maybe we could get back on schedule.

17:25.749 --> 17:27.479
We don't want to miss
Sedaka's opening act...

17:27.503 --> 17:28.670
Extremely Little Richard.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.933
- Good golly, is he small!
- [Laughs]

17:30.958 --> 17:32.892
Change of plans...
I traded those tickets

17:32.917 --> 17:34.819
for seats to "Sexcalibur."

17:34.844 --> 17:36.967
- You what?
- It's a dirty "Medieval Times."

17:36.992 --> 17:38.315
Are you kidding me?

17:38.340 --> 17:39.605
It's okay, Phil.

17:39.630 --> 17:42.065
I waited 79 years to see Neil Sedaka.

17:42.090 --> 17:43.881
I can wait another 79.

17:43.906 --> 17:45.652
No, Dad. You're being too nice.

17:45.677 --> 17:48.751
This is your bachelor party, not yours!

17:48.776 --> 17:50.308
You're ruining this whole night.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.110
You ruined it when you planned it.

17:52.135 --> 17:54.252
And get that finger out of my face.

17:54.277 --> 17:56.414
Nobody hijacks my dad's party,

17:56.439 --> 17:58.823
and nobody tells me where...

17:58.848 --> 18:00.198
to put my finger.

18:00.452 --> 18:01.505
Boop!

18:02.042 --> 18:03.108
Here we go.

18:04.762 --> 18:06.565
I wanted a brother when I was 10,

18:06.590 --> 18:07.900
not a 10-year-old brother!

18:07.925 --> 18:09.156
You're the baby!

18:09.181 --> 18:11.246
You're older, but you're the baby.

18:11.271 --> 18:12.607
You're no Marty!

18:12.632 --> 18:14.065
It's not much of a fight,
but maybe we should...

18:14.116 --> 18:16.246
I know. I thought it was gonna get good.

18:16.271 --> 18:18.470
All right, that's enough. Stop.

18:18.495 --> 18:19.728
Phil, you're being ridiculous.

18:19.753 --> 18:22.587
Ray, I don't know you, but
you seem like a horse's ass.

18:22.612 --> 18:24.578
All right, now! Grow up!

18:24.603 --> 18:26.202
Start acting like gentlemen.

18:26.227 --> 18:28.001
Uh, would you two mind

18:28.026 --> 18:29.765
stepping out in the hall for a second?

18:29.790 --> 18:32.252
- I need to have a word with Phil.
- All right, but hurry up.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.778
We don't want to miss the
unlacing of the first wench.

18:35.044 --> 18:36.230
- [Door opens, closes]
- You know, I really appreciate

18:36.255 --> 18:38.979
all you've done arranging
my party, but, you know,

18:39.113 --> 18:41.217
I'm happy doing whatever.

18:41.242 --> 18:42.882
Is something else bothering you?

18:42.907 --> 18:44.219
I don't know.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.217
So much is changing, Dad.

18:46.242 --> 18:48.898
I guess I'm kind of afraid
that this is the end of an era.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.291
Now I have to share you
with Lorraine, with that.

18:51.316 --> 18:53.034
You're not losing me.

18:53.059 --> 18:55.398
As a matter of fact, you're
gonna be seeing a lot more of me.

18:55.423 --> 18:58.509
Lorraine and I have been kind
of kicking around the idea of...

18:58.581 --> 19:00.336
moving to California.

19:00.554 --> 19:02.012
To be closer to me?

19:02.037 --> 19:03.436
Yes.

19:03.461 --> 19:05.658
And to be farther from Ray.

19:07.181 --> 19:08.458
Hey, Louise,

19:08.483 --> 19:10.215
we just saw evil Fizbo again.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.357
It's true. I was there. We
lost him in the parking lot.

19:12.382 --> 19:13.412
Yeah, we looked in every car.

19:13.437 --> 19:15.430
Geez, Louise, there has
to be something you can do.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.150
Fine. First thing tomorrow,
I'll look into it...

19:17.175 --> 19:18.894
- if you can focus on bowling.
- I can.

19:18.919 --> 19:20.691
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.423
- It's your turn.
- Sorry. I was in the ladies room.

19:22.448 --> 19:24.200
I was putting IcyHot on my hammies.

19:24.225 --> 19:25.249
Mm.

19:26.045 --> 19:27.411
Ahh! Ohh.

19:27.436 --> 19:28.835
D-Did you do something to your hand?

19:28.860 --> 19:30.535
I just hurt it playing air hockey.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.359
They got rid of the air
hockey table months ago.

19:32.384 --> 19:33.918
Uh... nothing. I mean, I was...

19:33.943 --> 19:35.710
Wait... w-wait... wait a minute.

19:35.735 --> 19:36.867
You go missing,

19:36.892 --> 19:39.005
then you mysteriously
hurt your hand, and t...

19:39.030 --> 19:41.650
Okay, okay... there is
lipstick in this mask,

19:41.675 --> 19:43.198
and it is... it is the same shade

19:43.223 --> 19:44.765
as the lipstick on your beer.

19:44.790 --> 19:46.690
[Gasps] You're Fizbo?

19:46.715 --> 19:47.747
You wear lipstick?

19:47.772 --> 19:49.391
But you're on our team.

19:49.416 --> 19:50.790
Why would you do this?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.383
Because you bug me.

19:53.205 --> 19:54.311
That's it?

19:54.336 --> 19:56.603
You picked the team name,
you designed the shirts,

19:56.628 --> 19:57.664
you take all the credit.

19:57.689 --> 19:59.056
Everything's about you.

19:59.081 --> 20:02.114
You messed with his head so he'd
lose us the team championship.

20:02.139 --> 20:04.524
Yeah, opening the door
for... for you to be captain.

20:04.549 --> 20:05.952
I should be captain.

20:05.977 --> 20:09.043
Give me my Fizbo.

20:10.727 --> 20:12.226
[Pins clatter]

20:12.942 --> 20:13.986
You get out of my face.

20:14.011 --> 20:15.170
Wait, wait, no. Hold on. Hold on.

20:15.195 --> 20:16.844
Is there still a chance
that we could win this?

20:16.869 --> 20:19.448
Not unless we can pick
up 57 pins in one frame.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.720
Yeah. And you get out of his face.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.715
Hello, fruit of your father's loins.

20:26.740 --> 20:27.934
"Mitchell's" fine.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.339
You know, speaking of Jay...

20:29.364 --> 20:30.367
You brought him up.

20:30.392 --> 20:33.220
Well, your father and I had a moment...

20:33.245 --> 20:35.035
- Uh-huh...
- ... a couple of years ago

20:35.137 --> 20:37.537
when he was pretending to be gay

20:37.562 --> 20:39.294
so that he could bowl in our league.

20:39.319 --> 20:40.718
I know he said it was all an act,

20:40.743 --> 20:43.043
but what I felt from him...

20:43.112 --> 20:44.654
It was just so very real.

20:44.679 --> 20:46.218
Okay, Martin, I hate
to break this to you,

20:46.243 --> 20:49.025
but my dad is potentially the
straightest man on the planet.

20:49.050 --> 20:50.196
Yeah, but that not withstanding,

20:50.221 --> 20:52.352
do you think maybe you could
give me his phone number?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.920
It's just always felt like
unfinished business to me.

20:54.945 --> 20:56.656
I am not giving you his phone number.

20:56.681 --> 20:59.248
- I'll give you my trophy.
- It's 3-1-0...
