what is your name?

04:24.098 --> 04:26.558
Sasquatch don't talk.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.019
Had a passport on him, though.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.729
Jack Reacher.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.815
- No middle name.
- Zip ties?

04:32.815 --> 04:34.692
Cuffs didn't fit him.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.068
No stamps.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.320
Newer than January 1st.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.322
You planning on
leaving the country?

04:40.406 --> 04:41.824
Everything else he was carrying.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.201
- What's that about, 200?
- Two-twelve.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.162
This looks like
some kind of foreign deal.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.707
World War II medal.
French.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.543

holding just this.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.753

04:54.837 --> 04:58.173

04:58.257 --> 05:00.718

in my town?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.012
Don't want to talk?

05:03.012 --> 05:05.014
Maybe we put you
in the holding cell,

05:05.014 --> 05:07.266
get you to change your mind.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.810
And how exactly
would you do that?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.605
Explain to him
his constitutional rights

05:13.689 --> 05:15.441
under the Fifth
and 14th Amendments,

05:15.441 --> 05:18.944
then hope he waives them
of his own free will?

05:19.028 --> 05:20.946
Yep.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.407
No need. I've got it from here.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.577
Take him to the conference room.
I'll be in in a moment.

05:30.956 --> 05:35.044
Mr. Reacher, I'm
Chief Detective Oscar Finlay.

05:35.044 --> 05:37.629
I'll be asking you
some questions.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.340
I was informed
you were read your rights,

05:40.424 --> 05:42.551
so you know
you don't have to answer.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.721
Hmm.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.725
Body was found by the highway
embankment, near an overpass,

05:49.725 --> 05:52.770
partially covered by
flattened-out cardboard boxes.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.981
Two nine-millimeter,
95-grain, close-range shots

05:56.065 --> 05:57.399
to the back of the head.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.318
No casings found.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.780
Victim was male, 30s, big guy.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.365
He was beaten badly postmortem.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.242
No I.D. yet.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.579
Problem getting prints off
the body's swollen fingertips.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.041
You know who this man was?

06:15.084 --> 06:17.002
How he wound up dead?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.632
Anything you want to share
besides your riveting company?

06:26.011 --> 06:27.513
Okay, then.

06:27.513 --> 06:31.517
Well, I'm not about to waste
the rest of my afternoon.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.060
Maybe your
court-appointed attorney

06:33.060 --> 06:34.812
will get you to open up.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.022
I don't need a lawyer.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.024
He speaks.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.652
When he wants to.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.279
And why don't you need a lawyer?

06:44.363 --> 06:46.365
Because I didn't kill anybody.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.035
At least not recently.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
And not in this town.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.166
This is
kind of impossible.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.460
- What's that?
- This Reacher fella.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.337
So far, run on his prints
has been clean,

07:00.337 --> 07:02.464
but something can still turn up.

07:02.548 --> 07:06.426
But there's no Facebook,
Snapchat, Instagram.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.888
No driver's license,
mortgage, insurance claims.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.099
No online profile at all.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.059
The only proof
Jack Reacher exists

07:14.143 --> 07:16.895
is the fact that
he's sitting in that room.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.481
Jack Reacher.
Parents deceased.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.525
One brother, Joe,
older by two years.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.068
Retired Army.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.946
Commanded the 110th
Special Investigations Unit

07:25.946 --> 07:28.323
of the Military Police.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.909
Took out a few men
in the course of your duties.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.661
All ruled good kills.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.788
What if I'm thinking
I'm sitting across from

07:34.872 --> 07:36.290
a man who doesn't mind killing

07:36.290 --> 07:39.168
and who has the knowledge
and training to murder someone

07:39.168 --> 07:40.669
and cover it up?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.963
You'd be right.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.340
But not this murder.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.842
Three men dropped this body.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.385
Enlighten me.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.596
Shooter was someone
who knows firearms well.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.140
Bullets were small caliber--
nine-millimeter, 95-grain.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.601
That's subsonic.
A silencer was used.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.811
He also knew enough
to pick up his brass.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.313
This wasn't a first-timer.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.691
This was someone who knew how to
conduct a quiet, effective kill.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.694
- Okay, go on.
- You're also looking for

08:05.694 --> 08:07.738
a psycho who'd beat up
a body postmortem,

08:07.738 --> 08:09.573
someone completely unhinged.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.952
Totally different profile
from your professional shooter.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.454
Something wrong?

08:17.206 --> 08:18.957
No.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.500
You said there were three.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.502
Your psycho isn't suddenly
gonna be rational enough to know

08:22.586 --> 08:24.046
he has to hide the body.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.589
And your meticulous shooter
isn't gonna do

08:25.589 --> 08:27.591
a sloppy job
with roadside cardboard.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.051
No, the third guy
is so worried about

08:29.051 --> 08:30.761
getting out of there,
he grabs some nearby debris

08:30.761 --> 08:32.387
and just lays it
across the corpse.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.805
You said the victim was big,

08:33.889 --> 08:35.224
so most likely
his feet were sticking out

08:35.224 --> 08:37.726
and that's how he got spotted.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.270
Tall people never have
enough room for their feet.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.064
Interesting theory.

08:42.064 --> 08:44.441
But you still match
the description of someone

08:44.441 --> 08:46.818
seen walking the highway,
earlier today,

08:46.902 --> 08:48.111
near where the body was found.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.738
Well, that's 'cause it was me.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.616
I got off the bus from Tampa
and walked to town.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.742
Greyhound doesn't have
a stop in Margrave.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.952
I never said it did.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.079
You just said
you got off in Margrave.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.413
I asked the driver
to do me a favor.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.831
- Why?
- On account of Blind Blake.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.042
- Okay. Who's that?
- Blues singer.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.920
Legend has it he died
in Margrave a long time ago.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.464
I figured I'd learn
a bit about him.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.091
I like music.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.593
So you have no home, no phone.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.554
You get on a bus in Tampa
with $212,

09:14.638 --> 09:16.431
a toothbrush
and a French war medal

09:16.515 --> 09:18.141
and travel over 500 miles

09:18.225 --> 09:21.061
to read up on
a dead blues musician?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.729
That sum up your past 24 hours?

09:22.813 --> 09:23.730
No.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.315
I also went to a diner,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.693
ordered peach pie
and never got to eat it

09:27.693 --> 09:29.278
'cause I was arrested
for murder.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.862
Okay.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.948
Medical examiner puts
the victim's time of death

09:32.948 --> 09:34.449
at around midnight last night.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.285
This morning.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.662
It's last night until
11:59 and 59 seconds,

09:38.662 --> 09:41.373
and then it becomes
this morning.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.709
In an investigation,
details matter.

09:43.709 --> 09:48.005
12:00 a.m. this morning
is the time of death.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.882
If I can confirm you were
on a Greyhound bus at that time,

09:50.966 --> 09:53.010
you're cleared.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.137
Until then,
you're in the holding cell.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.347
We're running down
a phone number

09:57.431 --> 09:59.141
found in the dead guy's shoe.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.018
It was on a scrap of paper

10:01.018 --> 10:03.395
with the word "Pluribus"
written on it.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.106
Want to clear that up, too,
before we let you go?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.274
Know anything about that?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.609
Means I'm gonna be here
for a while.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.739
Phone companies are slow
responding to warrants.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.490
Too bad.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.243
Law says we need a warrant.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.037
Come on, you're in the hold.

10:22.289 --> 10:26.585
Reacher, why does
trouble always seem to find you?

10:26.585 --> 10:27.919
Reacher, Reacher!

10:28.003 --> 10:30.672
The whole moving truck
could've burned down.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.175
What were you thinking?
You cannot pack fireworks.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.177
But they're from
the Fourth of July.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.803


10:36.887 --> 10:38.513
This is the last of it.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.891
Okay, next transfer,
I want half of the boxes.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.477
I don't know how four people
accumulate all of this.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.770
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.271
Okay. Father and I will unpack.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.898
You two,
go and meet the base kids.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.776
This is home now,
hopefully for a while.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.903
Go make friends.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.740
Think we'll like it here?

10:56.740 --> 10:58.033
School lessons will be the same.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.827
Army-issued furniture
will be the same.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.622
It'll be just like Cameroon,
Belgium and Spain.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.501
You the new guys
that just moved in today?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.753
Yeah. This the way to the beach?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.588
Yeah.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.632
But it's five bucks.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.050
What's five bucks?

11:15.050 --> 11:16.760
From the looks of it,
your jacket.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.182
Yeah. I'm big for my age.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.934
Just like you're ugly
for your age.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.144
Let's just go home.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.403
Okay.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.117
You don't have to do this.
It's my fight.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.452
It's never just your fight.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.248
You know, Mom was right.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.999
Trouble does kind of
seem to find you.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.241
Thanks.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.826
Been in here a while now.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.327
Figured you could use
a pick-me-up.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.829
Not my fault.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.790
Trouble just kind of
seems to find me.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.625
What I could really use
is getting these ties off.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.919
Chief Morrison
says they stay on.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.297
Assumed you liked it black.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.756
How'd you figure?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.758
Seem like a no-nonsense guy.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.635
Cream and sugar are nonsense.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.471
So you know I'm innocent.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.889
How do you figure?

12:43.889 --> 12:46.641
I doubt it's procedure
to bring coffee to the guilty.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.894
Well, if you are guilty
of something, can't be much.

12:48.894 --> 12:51.646
Preliminary run on your prints
turned up nothing.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.899
Bad guys set off
bells and whistles right away.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.318
Roscoe, we're taking a ride.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.069
Got a hit on the phone number.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.698
Sorry. Ceramic.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.243
Thank you.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.162
Sorry, Baker.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.711
So, Paul,
when I called, I informed you

13:14.711 --> 13:17.589
your cell number was found
at the situs of a crime.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.842
You invited me over to chat
but never asked what crime.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.552
Found that strange.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.015
Well, you scared the shit
out of me.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.642
Hmm.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.060
I wasn't thinking.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.562
I just wanted to get you
over here so we could talk.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.732
- About what?
- You tell me.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.026
Murder.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.945
You know anything about that?

13:41.279 --> 13:43.198
Unidentified male shot to death.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.202
He was found with your number

13:47.202 --> 13:49.704
written on a paper scrap
in his shoe.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.045
I did it.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.799
I killed the guy.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.300
It was me.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.138
Mr. Hubble,
for your protection and ours,

14:07.222 --> 14:08.890
I'm going to record you
getting your rights.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.600
No, I-I know my rights.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.061
I understand I don't have to
talk or anything and that I get

14:13.061 --> 14:16.064
a lawyer and all that,
but I did it, okay?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.316
I killed the guy,
by the highway.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.442
I was the one.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.861
Okay, so this man you killed...

14:23.113 --> 14:24.531
...what was his name?

14:25.991 --> 14:27.325
I-I don't know.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.535
You killed a man you don't know?

14:28.535 --> 14:29.953
Yeah, that's right.

14:29.953 --> 14:33.039
It was, uh... self-defense.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.669
Okay, you said it took place
by the highway.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.505
Where exactly along the highway?

14:42.007 --> 14:44.175
I-I told you I did it, okay?

14:44.259 --> 14:46.303
I'm not about to rehash
all the details.

14:46.303 --> 14:50.599
You are my second
annoying interrogation today.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.559
So you expect me
to believe that you,

14:52.559 --> 14:56.354
a man with no criminal record,
that you just blew a man away?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.774
A double-barrel shotgun blast
right to the face?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.612
And then burnt the body?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.906
Yes, I did.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.118
And-and that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.247
Your life's about to get
very complicated, Mr. Hubble.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.473
Get in.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.775
Reacher, come with me.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.193
No.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.903
Excuse me?

15:44.903 --> 15:47.656
Not until you let
these zip ties come off.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.574
We both know
I didn't kill anybody,

15:49.658 --> 15:51.159
and they're uncomfortable.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.412
Get the box cutter.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.081
That's okay.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.582
I got it.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.470
You guys recycle?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.726
Outside. Uncuffed.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.354
Treating me like a person
instead of a perp.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.106
I've done the same thing
a million times when I want

16:21.106 --> 16:23.525
a suspect to trust me
even when they shouldn't.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.403
I have no ulterior motives,
just information.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.071
That other guy,
Paul Hubble, banker.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.948
Lives in Margrave,
works in Atlanta.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.282
No priors.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.284
He just confessed to the murder.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.328
Oh. How nice.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.915
- Thanks for the hospitality.
- Not so fast.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.709
You want to run? Go for it.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.795
But I doubt you're that fast
or that bulletproof.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.047
I was just cleared.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.674
One guy lied about
killing another guy.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.343
- That doesn't clear you.
- Good town to murder in.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.262
Even when you confess,
nothing happens to you.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.638
Oh, you saw Hubble.
He's a citizen.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.558
He can't shoot pool
let alone shoot a person.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.435
He admitted to things
that didn't even happen.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.228
He just wants me
to think he did it

17:00.228 --> 17:01.730
and not look into
the matter any further.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.273
You think I'm working with him.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.691
Now that
he's implicated himself,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
I'm worried
he might implicate me.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.069
So maybe I'll cut a deal
and talk.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.779
Maybe I'm just thinking
the guy who was seen

17:09.863 --> 17:11.698
near the murder site,
guilty or not,

17:11.698 --> 17:13.283
might still have
information to share.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.368
I don't. But Stevenson does.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.328
He and Hubble were
looking at each other.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.705
They looked at each other?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.540
They held eye contact
for a full two Mississippis.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.251
Stevenson and Hubble have
cousins that married each other.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.878
He's just worried about family.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.588
It's more than that.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.298
You always so confident
in your theories?

17:28.298 --> 17:29.883
As confident as I am
that you went to Harvard,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.134
you're recently divorced,

17:31.134 --> 17:33.136
and you quit smoking
in the last six months.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.096
How'd you come up with that?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.849
My friend back there, Baker,
he called you a Beantown bitch.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.809
And from all appearances,
you're well-educated,

17:39.893 --> 17:41.603
but you took a job
in the middle of nowhere

17:41.603 --> 17:43.563
with people that look
nothing like you.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.523
You're stubborn. You have
a chip on your shoulder.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.983
You don't care
if your coworkers like you.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.401
A guy like that
doesn't go to B.U.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.028
He goes to Harvard.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.030
To show those blue-blood
assholes what he's capable of.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.156
Am I right?

17:53.156 --> 17:55.742
About going to Harvard? Yes.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.951
You're also about 40,

17:57.035 --> 17:58.578
which means you did your 20
at Boston P.D.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.497
to get your pension, so you can
afford a proper Southern suit,

18:00.497 --> 18:02.373
but you still look like
Black Sherlock Holmes.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.834
Means no woman in your life
making sure you dress right.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.336
Death or divorce.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.837
At your age, divorce is
a higher probability.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.631
But you still wear the ring.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.175
By the wear on it, you play
with it, obsess over it.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.760
Like I said, you're stubborn.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.720
Still hoping to reconcile
with the old lady.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.931
- Her name's Sharon.
- As for the smoking,

18:17.931 --> 18:19.933
when I broke down
the three murderers back there,

18:19.933 --> 18:21.976
you started to think
you had the wrong guy.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.895
Stressed you out.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.439
The water in your glass
moved a bit.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.107
We're not on
any major fault lines.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.944
That means your leg was
bouncing under the table.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.029
That combined with
the slight aroma of cigarettes

18:33.029 --> 18:35.782
in your suit-- 'cause it's hard
to get out of... tweed--

18:35.782 --> 18:37.784
and I assume
nicotine withdrawal.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.410
Most studies show
it takes four to six months

18:39.494 --> 18:40.537
to fully break a habit.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.249
You keep up
the good work, though.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.042
Those things are killers.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.380
Back inside.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.387
Follow me.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.264
Stevenson, my office.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.566
This man seems to think
you know something about Hubble

19:09.566 --> 19:12.277
that you aren't sharing with me.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.695
That true?

19:14.696 --> 19:17.282
Answer isn't on your shoes.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.284
Uh, sir, there was
a-a family party last night.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.619
My, uh, grandparents,
their anniversary, their 50th...

19:21.703 --> 19:22.829
I don't care.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.205
Right.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.415
Well, Hubble and Charlie
were there.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.751
- Who's Charlie?
- Charlene. His wife.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.879
We stayed late.
We danced with our wives.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.881
Way past 2:00.
I drove them home.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.173
I don't know
why his number

19:34.257 --> 19:35.592
was in that guy's shoe,

19:35.592 --> 19:37.093
and I don't know
why he confessed.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.219
All I know is that at midnight,

19:38.303 --> 19:39.220
he was nowhere near
that highway.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.139
- Hubble into drugs?
- No.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.224
- He cheat on his wife?
- No. He's a family man.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.767
Don't answer his questions.
He's not your boss.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.561
- Right. Sorry.
- Does he having money problems?

19:48.146 --> 19:49.689
I don't know what to do.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.107
Just answer the question.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.567
No. He's rich.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.902
Okay. Get out of here.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.910
Drugs, money, infidelity.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.995
If Stevenson's right,
we've eliminated the big three,

20:03.995 --> 20:05.622
which means
the only way you'll know

20:05.622 --> 20:07.373
why Hubble confessed
is if he tells you.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.876
Yeah, well, maybe a weekend
in lockup will motivate him.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.463
Let me know what he says.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.173
What the hell does that mean?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.175
You figured out I quit smoking

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
but can't figure out
what's happening right now?

20:21.304 --> 20:23.681
This is bullshit.
You have a confession.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.350
I helped with the investigation.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.061
You helped me?

20:28.061 --> 20:32.231
You seem to be confused about
your role in this situation.

20:32.315 --> 20:35.985
You are my detainee and suspect,
not my partner or my equal.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.696
And you're certainly not,
by employment, appearance

20:38.780 --> 20:41.240
or lifestyle choice,
a cop anymore.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.117
Now, Chief Morrison
wants you in custody

20:43.201 --> 20:45.328
till we know for sure
that all six-foot-four of you

20:45.328 --> 20:46.621
was on that bus from Tampa.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.122
Six-foot-five.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.375
In an investigation,
details matter.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.793
Here's a detail for you.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.213
We keep extra-large cuffs
in our lockbox.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.809
Inventory his watch and ring.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.520
They'll steal them first
five minutes he's in there.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.773
It was nice talking to you.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.786
Thanks.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.039
For the watch thing.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.416
Shut up.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.669
You ruined my trip here.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.396
Jesus.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.358
My name's Officer Spivey.

21:57.442 --> 22:01.029
Time to follow
the yellow brick road, inmates.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.491
Y'all be housed far away
from the animal factory,

22:05.575 --> 22:08.536
till they can line up
a weekend arraignment for you.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.544
All the fixings.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.924
Ain't no jumper
gonna fit you, big boy.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.721
But a Samoan fella come through
here last year-- meth dealer--

22:26.721 --> 22:29.599
had scrubs made up special.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.937
Might be a little tight
in the shoulders.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.195
Whoa! Not so fast.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.781
Drop them drawers,
bend over and spread.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.117
No.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.079
Blanket strip search policies
are unconstitutional

22:51.079 --> 22:54.457
unless there's clear articulable
suspicion of criminal activity.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.584
The victim
I'm suspected of murdering

22:56.584 --> 22:59.879
was shot by a handgun that would
measure four inches by six.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.506
That weapon's
not fitting inside me

23:01.506 --> 23:03.966
or any other human being without
sending them to a hospital.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.302
Since that's the only contraband
related to this crime,

23:06.302 --> 23:08.805
your request is unlawful.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.848
It's not like I want to do this.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.058
Regulations say...

23:12.058 --> 23:14.936
The only thing up my ass
right now is you.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.189
So if you think you can
perform the inspection

23:18.189 --> 23:21.192
without getting
seriously injured, go for it.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.905
Otherwise, check the box
on your clipboard.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.168
Go on.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.298
Mm-hmm.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.474
Really sorry
I got you into this.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.226
- It wasn't my intention...
- Remember when I said

23:55.226 --> 23:57.145
"shut up" on the bus?

23:57.145 --> 23:58.896
Same rule goes for jail.

24:39.145 --> 24:42.356
- Well, that's not good.
- What's going on?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.317
We're not with guys
awaiting arraignment.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.194
- We're with the lifers.
- What do you mean, lifers?

24:46.194 --> 24:48.487
I mean people
sentenced for life.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.498
If I were you, I'd be less
worried about their sentences

24:59.582 --> 25:01.542
and more concerned
with their swaps.

25:01.626 --> 25:02.835
Swaps?

25:02.919 --> 25:04.837
Guys swapping smokes,
desserts, TV time,

25:04.921 --> 25:07.465
all for first crack at you.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.301
You're not a human in here.
You're currency.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.262
So stop stressing
and save your strength.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.474
Gonna need it.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.272
There she is.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.694
Whoo. She pretty.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.447
Look, she even got
pretty little shoes on.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.324
Give me them shoes, baby.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.284
Come on, now. You heard me.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.578
Give me my shoes
like a good little bitch.

25:38.579 --> 25:39.997
I said give them to me.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.876
Good girl.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.050
I like them glasses, too.
Give me my glasses.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.486
Now there's just one more thing
I want from you.

26:21.706 --> 26:24.166
Look at this
redwood motherfucker.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.209
What you want?

26:25.293 --> 26:27.086
To give you a choice.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.464
See, you're in my house, fatso,
and you didn't ask permission.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.050
So you and your friends
can leave now,

26:33.134 --> 26:35.928
or they can carry
your fat ass out in a bucket.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.392
Now I'll count to three.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.769
Bitch, do you know
who you talking to?

26:43.853 --> 26:45.229
One.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.107
Two.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.241
You owe us a pair of glasses.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.706
Now get out of my cell.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.671

27:29.482 --> 27:31.984
I won't let anybody touch you.

27:33.027 --> 27:34.195
Thank you.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.199
You're the only thing
keeping me alive in here.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.077
I'm in big trouble.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.954
- No shit.
- I'm not a criminal.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.874
A fucking currency manager.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.918
They gave me no choice.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.294
These guys, they forced me

27:50.378 --> 27:53.047
to help them with
their financial scheme, okay?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.425
And I know everyone
who's ever caught

27:56.509 --> 27:59.011
says they were forced into it,
but I really was.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.263
And the people
I'm working for made it clear

28:01.347 --> 28:03.766
- if I jam them up...
- Then you'd be killed.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.311
I wish that were all.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.232
My bosses promised,
if I disrupt their operation

28:11.232 --> 28:13.109
in any way, they'd...

28:14.610 --> 28:17.446
They'd
nail me to a wall.

28:17.530 --> 28:18.864
Literally.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.241
In front of my family.

28:20.241 --> 28:24.120
They'd cut my balls off
and make me eat 'em.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.416
Then they'd bleed me and
my wife out slow so we'd die

28:28.416 --> 28:32.378
knowing our kids were left
with those psychos,

28:32.378 --> 28:34.672
not knowing
what would be done to them.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.635
I'm gonna hit the head.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.763
I'll go with you.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.015
Figured as much.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.013
Him.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.659
If you boys knew what's about to
happen to you, you'd leave now.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.788
So I'll give you
to the count of three.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.290
One.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.641
Security team
to gen pop shower four.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.142
Against the wall! Move!

30:40.589 --> 30:43.217
What the hell are
you two doing down here?

30:43.217 --> 30:45.469
Come on. Let's go,
before the warden sees.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.388
Let's go! Let's go!

30:51.100 --> 30:54.270
My report says
you were placed upstairs.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.188
Why are you in gen pop?

30:56.272 --> 30:58.440
That's where the guy put us.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.166
- Want to hear his MP numbers?
- No.

33:21.250 --> 33:25.421
Over 150 closed cases,
all successful prosecutions,

33:25.421 --> 33:27.589
more than 20 fugitives captured.

35:39.263 --> 35:42.182
But bodies are falling.
Means someone's getting nervous.

35:43.392 --> 35:45.644
When that happens,
things can change fast.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.440
I'm more curious why whoever
you work for wants me dead.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.359
- What do you mean?
- That guard from last night,

35:52.359 --> 35:54.319
Spivey,

35:54.403 --> 35:56.363
he set us up in gen pop.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.740
He'd play it off like it was
some kind of innocent mistake,

35:58.824 --> 36:00.617
but it was intentional.

36:00.701 --> 36:03.537
Guys in the shower I.D.'d me
as a person to take out.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.623
Once I'm out of here, I'm gone,

36:07.791 --> 36:09.710
Something bad's
going down in Margrave,

36:09.710 --> 36:11.795
and I don't need
to be a part of it.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.182
My wife should be here soon.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.893
I don't give a shit.

36:37.321 --> 36:40.782
Figured a guy with no money,
I.D. or car could use a lift.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.713
- That's me.
- Greyhound confirmed

36:54.713 --> 36:56.465
that's their Tampa station
two nights ago.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.717
No way you could've been in
Margrave in time to kill anyone.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.470
Common carriers are
notoriously difficult.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.348
N-Nothing without a warrant.
How'd you get them to cooperate?

37:04.348 --> 37:05.599
Lied.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.643
Said that we suspected
one of their employees

37:07.643 --> 37:09.561
of using their buses
to transport coke.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.146
If they didn't cooperate,
promised to pull

37:11.146 --> 37:12.648
a civil forfeiture
on everything with wheels

37:12.648 --> 37:14.358
until our investigation
was over.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.860
Got that video within the hour.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.111
So you cleared me,

37:18.195 --> 37:19.780
but how does the guy
who confessed walk away?

37:19.780 --> 37:21.990
Well, everybody
knows that Hubble's lying,

37:22.074 --> 37:24.493
so we're holding off on charges,

37:24.493 --> 37:27.537
hoping that a nervous guy like
him just does something dumb

37:27.621 --> 37:29.122
that leads us to the truth

37:29.206 --> 37:33.085
or just cracks and spills
what really went down.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.878
Smart approach, Officer Roscoe.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.382
Roscoe's actually my first name.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.052
Never met a woman
named Roscoe before.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.136
Yeah, you did.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.472
A day ago.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.266
So what's your last name?

37:48.350 --> 37:49.893
Conklin.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.814
Caught a love tap inside?

37:53.814 --> 37:56.108
I got set up.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.652
- By who?
- Some guard.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.320
Just the errand boy.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.280
But whoever he took orders
from wanted me gone,

38:02.364 --> 38:04.449
and they're gonna get
what they want.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.702
I'm on the next bus out of here.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.620
That's a shame.

38:09.871 --> 38:13.166
I feel bad about the Margrave
welcome wagon running you over.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.129
I was gonna apologize
with an early dinner,

38:17.129 --> 38:18.380
but if you're not
sticking around...

38:18.380 --> 38:19.673
Okay.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.551
Great.

38:24.386 --> 38:27.305
But I'm gonna need
some new clothes first.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.182
Lockup's made me a bit gamey.

38:29.266 --> 38:31.184
Oh, we got
a Merl's Men's Shop in town.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.354
I don't need anything
that fancy.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.856
Just T-shirt and jeans.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.818
I travel light.

38:43.405 --> 38:45.824
You sure you don't
want to get new threads?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.743
They'll be new to me.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.538
I don't get it.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.832
Don't you want
a home base or something?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.751
Had a home base my whole life.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.295
Grew up in the military,
worked in the military.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.213
Always told where to go,
when to be there.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.300
Now I see my country
on my own terms.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.885
What about money?

39:04.885 --> 39:07.179
Pension's wired to
a Western Union each month.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.307
Don't you miss your family?

39:10.307 --> 39:12.517
I guess so. They're all dead.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.728
Except for my brother Joe.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.813
- He's a good guy.
- Where's he?

39:18.231 --> 39:19.733
No idea.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.653
So what really
brought you to Margrave?

39:23.737 --> 39:25.363
Can't be some blues singer.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.949
I don't lie to people
who get me out of jail.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.243
I'm here because of Blind Blake,

39:30.327 --> 39:33.080
but actually
it's on account of Chauncey.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.581
Who's Chauncey?

39:35.957 --> 39:38.794
A couple days ago, I go to
Chauncey's Bar & Grill in Tampa.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.922
Guy there was playing "Police
Dog Blues" by Blind Blake.

39:41.922 --> 39:43.381
I remembered
a conversation I had

39:43.465 --> 39:45.592
with my brother Joe
a while back.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.469
Read some article about Blake,
said he played his last show

39:47.469 --> 39:49.554
in Margrave,
and that's where he died.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.724
So I got on a bus.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.771
So you just go wherever
you want, whenever you want?

39:57.771 --> 40:00.315
Everyone's always jealous.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.400
Well, yeah, that's, um...

40:03.985 --> 40:05.695
...an interesting
approach to life.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.072
Works for me.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.090
So I'll check out
the town for a while

40:25.090 --> 40:27.008
- and see you in a bit.
- Sounds good.

40:27.092 --> 40:30.220
Now, don't go getting yourself
arrested for murder again.

40:33.849 --> 40:38.895
<i>♪ If you see my baby,
Lordy, stand around</i> ♪

40:38.979 --> 40:42.107
<i>♪ You know we somewhere,
baby, Lord, mama</i> ♪

40:42.107 --> 40:45.402
<i>♪ Shake 'em on down,

41:06.923 --> 41:11.052

<i>♪ You know we somewhere,

<i>Shake 'em on down ♪</i>

41:15.891 --> 41:17.893
<i>♪ Lordy, must I low...</i>

41:30.572 --> 41:32.824
If you want a trim,

41:32.908 --> 41:34.784
you got to wait.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.537
It's Mosley's meal time.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.706
I was thinking a shave,
Mr. Mosley.

41:39.706 --> 41:43.919
Blind alley cat
can shave and eat.

41:44.961 --> 41:48.590
Heard Mississippi Fred McDowell
coming from your shop.

41:48.590 --> 41:50.675
Thought a blues fan
might be able to tell me

41:50.759 --> 41:53.136
a bit about Blind Blake's
time in Margrave.

41:54.471 --> 41:56.181
Huh.

41:56.181 --> 42:00.936
Surprised a white man
your age knows Fred McDowell.

42:03.021 --> 42:06.441
More surprised
you know Blind Blake,

42:06.441 --> 42:07.943
Mr. Reacher.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.738
Small town.

42:11.738 --> 42:14.491
When a giant stranger
gets arrested for murder,

42:14.491 --> 42:17.494
word gets around.

42:17.494 --> 42:22.624
Course, Ms. Roscoe cleared you,
so I ain't scared of you none.

42:22.624 --> 42:25.252
My age, I ain't scared
of nothing much.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.003
Yeah, me neither.

42:27.087 --> 42:29.005
And everyone
just calls me Reacher.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.174
Even my mother did.

42:31.258 --> 42:33.677
Well, back you go.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.185
You know, my sister sang
with Blake a few times

42:42.269 --> 42:44.187
back in the day.

42:44.271 --> 42:47.148
He'd come through town
each year,

42:47.232 --> 42:51.319
play the church or some barn
in the sticks.

42:51.403 --> 42:53.530
- I heard he died here.
- That's the rumor.

42:53.530 --> 42:56.241
People would come from
all over town to hear it,

42:56.241 --> 42:58.535
even white folks.

42:58.535 --> 43:00.453
One hell
of a town it is.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.871
Freshly painted gazebo.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.832
Manicured flower beds.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.418
Statue recently polished.

43:06.418 --> 43:08.253
Got to think it's more
than civic pride.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.464
That it is.

43:11.548 --> 43:14.467
The Kliner Foundation
takes care of Margrave.

43:14.551 --> 43:17.971
Ever since Mr. Kliner came
to town about five years back

43:17.971 --> 43:20.932
from St. Louis to set up
his company right here.

43:21.016 --> 43:22.350
What kind of company is that?

43:22.434 --> 43:25.562
You name it,
Kliner do it.

43:25.562 --> 43:30.900
Real estate, trucking,
chemicals, machine parts.

43:30.984 --> 43:34.195
That statue out there?
Casper Teale?

43:34.279 --> 43:36.281
His grandson's our mayor.

43:36.281 --> 43:40.535
He gave Kliner a sweetheart
land deal for his factory.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.747
And in return, Kliner pours
money into the town.

43:43.747 --> 43:45.498
Win-win.

43:45.582 --> 43:48.335
That there
is Kliner Jr.

43:48.335 --> 43:50.879
and his bughouse cousin Dawson.

43:50.879 --> 43:53.882
Everyone calls Junior KJ.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.384
I call him trouble.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.929
Keep my seat warm, would you?

44:08.563 --> 44:11.733
You looking for a dance partner?

44:11.733 --> 44:13.360
'Cause the last person
who eyeballed me like that

44:13.360 --> 44:14.569
was a woman down in Panama

44:14.569 --> 44:15.862
when I was stationed
at Fort Sherman,

44:15.862 --> 44:18.990
and she wanted to dance
the tamborito with me.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.201
Do you want to dance
the tamborito with me?

44:21.201 --> 44:24.037
- Hell, I'll dance.
- Not talking to you, peewee.

44:24.037 --> 44:26.289
I was talking to the guy
in pricier boots,

44:26.373 --> 44:27.665
better haircut
and expensive truck

44:27.749 --> 44:29.292
he lets you sit shotgun in.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.879
So...

44:34.172 --> 44:35.799
...you want me to lead or...?

44:37.133 --> 44:38.760
I'm not much of a dancer.

44:39.761 --> 44:41.721
More of an academic
and a reader.

44:42.764 --> 44:46.017
Fact, I was reading something
interesting just this morning

44:46.101 --> 44:49.479
about some charges brought
against a Major Jack Reacher

44:49.479 --> 44:51.689
in a small village
outside of Baghdad.

44:52.732 --> 44:54.526
Charges of
a very serious nature,

44:54.526 --> 44:56.903
but charges
that somehow disappeared,

44:56.903 --> 45:00.365
like grains of sand
in an unforgiving desert.

45:00.365 --> 45:03.535
Somehow, the desert ended up
forgiving you, didn't it?

45:04.536 --> 45:06.538
We don't forgive as easily
in Margrave.

45:08.081 --> 45:09.958
Watch your back, Mr. Reacher.

45:44.701 --> 45:46.369
Hey.

45:46.453 --> 45:48.455
Sorry, dinner's
not gonna happen.

45:48.455 --> 45:50.582
- What's going on?
- Another body was found.

45:50.582 --> 45:52.167
In the brush, 40 yards
from the first one.

45:52.167 --> 45:53.626
Same caliber bullet.

45:53.710 --> 45:55.420
Got to go to the morgue.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.796
Can't say I'm not disappointed.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.298
I was looking forward
to spending time with you

45:58.298 --> 45:59.716
before leaving.

45:59.716 --> 46:01.759
Well, I don't know if you're
going anywhere just yet.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.011
Reacher!

46:03.011 --> 46:05.680
Did Hubble talk
when you two were locked up?

46:05.680 --> 46:07.474
- No.
- Baloney.

46:07.474 --> 46:08.933
Easy, Finlay.
Watch your language.

46:09.017 --> 46:10.226
You think this is funny?

46:10.310 --> 46:12.812
I got a town of 1,700 people
and two homicides.

46:12.896 --> 46:15.565
He didn't talk to me
the whole time we were in there.

46:15.565 --> 46:18.234
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.653
- Dinner would've been nice.
- You're not going anywhere.

46:20.737 --> 46:22.655
My alibi cleared.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.657
Just 'cause we know you weren't
here when these bodies dropped

46:24.741 --> 46:26.868
doesn't mean you might not
have something to do with them.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.328
So I'm wondering if maybe it was

46:28.328 --> 46:31.331
some other six-foot-five gorilla
on that grainy Greyhound tape.

46:31.331 --> 46:33.541
Maybe I need to bring in
a forensic expert

46:33.625 --> 46:35.001
to confirm it was you.

46:35.001 --> 46:38.004
And maybe you need to cool
your heels back in Warburton

46:38.004 --> 46:40.673
while we get that done over
the next two or three weeks.

46:40.757 --> 46:44.302
Or you get in the car,
we go to the morgue.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.387
Perhaps the medical examiner
will say something

46:46.471 --> 46:47.931
that jars your memory
about Hubble

46:47.931 --> 46:49.474
and you can share it with me.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.518
First you make it clear
I'm not a cop anymore.

46:51.518 --> 46:52.894
Now you want my help?

46:52.894 --> 46:54.646
I want you to do what I say.

46:54.646 --> 46:55.772
Now.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.742
Sometimes you're dead
and you don't even know it.

47:07.742 --> 47:10.078
This second guy, he was shot
in the back of the head

47:10.078 --> 47:12.622
while running away,
but his legs kept pumping

47:12.622 --> 47:14.457
for a few more feet
before his brain told him,

47:14.541 --> 47:16.960
"Hey, buddy, you're dead,"
so he fell over into the weeds.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.171
At least that's what the blood
spatters at the scene said.

47:20.255 --> 47:22.715
He was shot from far enough away
and it was so dark

47:22.799 --> 47:25.552
he couldn't be found, so
the killer just left him there.

47:25.552 --> 47:26.553
No I.D. on him.

47:26.553 --> 47:28.096
Killers.

47:28.096 --> 47:30.890
In an investigation,
details matter.

47:30.974 --> 47:33.309
Most likely more than one doer.

47:33.393 --> 47:34.978
Well, these are
my first murders,

47:34.978 --> 47:37.230
so please tell me you know
who did this.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.066
Mm-mm.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.068
What about
our first John Doe?

47:42.068 --> 47:44.237
- Any luck?
- Nope.

47:44.237 --> 47:46.531
He's been harder to crack
than a steel walnut.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.032
Dental work was inconsistent.

47:48.116 --> 47:50.326
Some of it was done in the U.S.,
and the rest was foreign.

47:50.410 --> 47:53.037
And his fingertips
were compromised by

47:53.121 --> 47:54.998
a dermatitis reaction.

47:54.998 --> 47:57.041
So swollen,
prints wouldn't come out clean

47:57.125 --> 47:58.710
until I drained
some of the fluid.

47:58.710 --> 48:00.420
We're waiting for the results.

48:00.420 --> 48:01.588
Whoa. No, do not...

48:01.588 --> 48:05.300
Um, is he new
on the force or...?

48:05.300 --> 48:06.884
No.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.761
Well, kind of.

48:08.845 --> 48:11.347
First victim
was allergic to latex.

48:11.431 --> 48:14.017
Killers must've worn some kind
of polyvinyl protective suit

48:14.017 --> 48:15.852
to keep blood DNA
off themselves.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.146
The victim grabbed it in the
struggle, causing his fingertips

48:18.146 --> 48:20.231
to swell in
a histaminic reaction.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.276
His dental work's off
'cause he had his teeth fixed

48:23.276 --> 48:25.361
wherever he was living
at the time.

48:25.445 --> 48:28.489
Broke his right arm when he was
eight, had it set in Berlin.

48:28.573 --> 48:31.534
Had his tonsils taken out
at ten in Seoul.

48:56.643 --> 48:57.852
We were wrestling.

49:00.313 --> 49:02.315
I pinned him against the stove.

49:04.025 --> 49:06.694
Didn't know my mother
had just turned it off.

49:11.991 --> 49:14.077
That's how my brother
got this scar.

49:22.085 --> 49:24.337
You tell me right now
what's going on.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.798
What was your brother
doing in Margrave?

49:26.798 --> 49:28.675
- I don't know.
- So it's just a coincidence

49:28.675 --> 49:31.135
you and he are passing through
the exact same Podunk town

49:31.219 --> 49:32.720
at the exact same
moment in time?

49:32.804 --> 49:34.847
- I don't know.
- When's the last time you saw Joe?

49:34.931 --> 49:36.349
A minute ago in the morgue.

49:36.349 --> 49:39.185
- You being smart with me?
- I'm being straight with you.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.104
Hell, no wonder Sharon left you.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.649
You keep my wife's name
out of your mouth.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.526
No. Enough.

49:46.526 --> 49:47.819
Reacher, you crossed a line.

49:47.819 --> 49:49.570
Finlay, let it rest.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.572
This man just lost his brother.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.700
One question,
and I want the truth.

49:53.700 --> 49:55.785
What are you doing
here in Margrave?

49:58.287 --> 49:59.664
Blind Blake!

49:59.664 --> 50:01.416
You're messing with
the wrong man.

50:01.416 --> 50:03.167
I'll tell you that right now.

50:03.251 --> 50:04.919
I swear, I'm gonna find
any reason I can

50:04.919 --> 50:06.045
to lock you up again.

50:06.129 --> 50:07.547
Oh, you won't even
get the cuffs on me.

50:07.547 --> 50:10.466
Okay, this isn't gonna happen.
Reacher, sit in the back.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.468
Hey. I know you're not
the kind of guy to beat up

50:12.552 --> 50:14.178
on somebody half your size
without good reason.

50:14.262 --> 50:15.888
- He's giving me a reason.
- Yeah?

50:15.972 --> 50:17.598
Well, I know people.

50:17.682 --> 50:19.684
And you've got kind eyes.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.062
Do what I say, Reacher.

50:23.146 --> 50:24.313
Please.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.872
You okay, Reacher?

50:42.707 --> 50:45.001
Just thinking maybe my brother
told me about Blind Blake

50:45.001 --> 50:46.169
for a reason.

50:46.169 --> 50:49.130
Thinking about him
lying in that morgue.

50:49.130 --> 50:52.133
Thinking I'm supposed
to do something about it.

50:53.176 --> 50:54.510
Like what?

50:56.429 --> 50:58.681
I guess I'll find
everybody responsible.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.809
And kill every last one of them.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.276
<i>Yeah ♪</i>

51:25.958 --> 51:29.128
<i>Yeah, you got satin shoes ♪</i>
