WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:09.710
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.245
YOU GUYS ARE ALL IN FOR A TREAT.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.381
I'M GONNA SHARE A LITTLE TASTE OF
MY CHILDHOOD WITH YOU TONIGHT.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.183
THIS IS LINGUINI DE LONGO,

00:15.216 --> 00:17.518
SAUTEED PEPPERS DE LONGO,
CHEESY GARLIC BREAD.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.521
- DE LONGO?
- NO, THAT'S DE FREEZER.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.391
HOW COME WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR LENNOX TO COME HOME?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.559
BECAUSE RYDER'S HUNGRY
AND HE'S A GROWING BOY.

00:25.593 --> 00:29.163
CALM DOWN, RYDER. WE'LL
EAT IN A SECOND, OKAY?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.598
SHE SAID SHE'LL BE HOME BY 6:00.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.200
COME ON, SHE'S AT THE MALL.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.701
SHE'S PROBABLY EATING FAST FOOD,

00:33.734 --> 00:35.203
WHICH IS THE WAY I LIKE MY FOOD.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.538
SO CAN WE STEP ON IT, LONGO?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.074
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT WANTED US TO
HAVE FAMILY DINNERS EVERY NIGHT.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.609
DON'T YOU REMEMBER? OPRAH
CAME TO YOU IN THAT DREAM

00:41.642 --> 00:44.345
AND SAID THAT KIDS THAT EAT WITH
THEIR FAMILY STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.748
THEN YOU WOKE UP SCREAMING,
"DON'T WE ALL GET FREE CARS?"

00:47.781 --> 00:49.250
YEAH WELL, I'VE
THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT

00:49.283 --> 00:51.018
AND I HAVE A BETTER WAY TO
KEEP KIDS OUT OF TROUBLE.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.553
YOU TELL THEM
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.323
- RYDER, DID I TELL YOU NOT TO DO DRUGS?
- YES, MA'AM.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.291
- AND ARE YOU DOING DRUGS?
- NO, MA'AM.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.728
- THERE YOU HAVE IT. AND DON'T CALL ME MA'AM.
- YES, SIR.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.198
THERE YOU ARE, MY SWEET CHILD.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.799
I MADE THEM WAIT FOR YOU.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.335
SO GET THIS.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.203
THE WEIRDEST THING
HAPPENED TO ME AT THE MALL

01:09.237 --> 01:11.038
WHILE I WAS IN THE
LADIES' BATHROOM.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.474
OH MY GOD, YOU ARE NEVER GOING
TO THE MALL BY YOURSELF AGAIN.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.276
BURKE, BURKE, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.112
BEFORE YOU GO NAMING A LAW AFTER LENNOX,
LET'S HEAR HER SIDE OF THE STORY.

01:18.146 --> 01:22.150
- CONTINUE, LENNOX.
- OKAY, THIS LADY GAVE ME HER BUSINESS CARD.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.685
"TASHA DE LA GARZA:
EARTH MODELS."

01:24.718 --> 01:26.254
IT'S A MODELING AGENCY.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.622
SHE WAS AT THE MALL LOOKING
FOR FRESH NEW FACES.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.591
IN THE LADIES' ROOM?

01:30.624 --> 01:34.061
- SHE SAID THAT I HAVE A LOOK THAT'S AUTHENTIC.
- OH, OKAY.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.763
AND HOW MANY AUTHENTIC DOLLARS

01:35.796 --> 01:37.431
IS SHE TRYING TO
SQUEEZE OUT OF YOU?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.767
YOU ARE SO SUSPICIOUS.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.137
OKAY, $500 FOR A
TRAINING COURSE.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.474
HONEY, SCAMS LIKE THIS
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.076
A WOMAN STOPS YOU IN THE
MALL, SAYS YOU'RE PRETTY.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.345
YOU HAND OVER YOUR BIRTHDAY
CHECKS, NEVER HEAR BACK.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.614
AND THEN THAT PIG-NOSED PENNY
DUNLOP MAKES FUN OF YOU SAYING,

01:53.647 --> 01:57.651
"MODELS ARE NEVER THAT SHORT,
MEL BURKE," OR WHOEVER.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.353
OKAY, BURKE, SO YOU GOT DUPED.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.356
MAYBE LENNOX IS AN INCH OR
TWO SAVVIER THAN YOU ARE.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.292
SHOULDN'T SHE AT LEAST GET A
CHANCE TO SEE FOR HERSELF?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.360
SEE WHAT? THAT MODELING AGENTS

02:06.394 --> 02:09.497
JUST WANT ANOREXIC ZOMBIES
TO HANG CLOTHES ON?

02:09.530 --> 02:12.600
ANYWAY, TASHA WAS
A MODEL HERSELF.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.268
AND HER AGENCY'S DIFFERENT.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.171
IT'S ALL ABOUT REAL
GIRLS WITH REAL BODIES.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.673
SHE INVITED ME TO COME
BY HER OFFICE TOMORROW.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.743
OKAY WELL, THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
GOING DOWN THERE IS WITH ME.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.613
AND WHEN WE GET TO TASHA'S
SEEDY, DREAM-KILLING LAIR,

02:25.646 --> 02:29.250
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT THIS FILTHY,
DIRTY, STINKING SCAM'S ALL ABOUT.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.885
HEAR THAT, LENNOX? YOUR AUNT
IS COMPLETELY ON BOARD.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.190

02:54.208 --> 02:56.644
Lennox: BOY, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THIS PLACE, AUNT MEL...

02:56.677 --> 02:59.347
IT'S A SEEDY HELL-HOLE
WHERE DREAMS GO TO DIE.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.416
OKAY, I WAS WRONG.
DREAMS GO TO DIE.WHERE

03:02.450 --> 03:05.353
- YOU WATCH.
- OH, THERE'S TASHA.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.788
I BET SHE DOESN'T SHE
HANDS HER CARD OUT TO.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.759
LENNOX ELIZABETH SCANLON!
I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE IT.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.794
- YOU HAVE A MIDDLE NAME?
- UH-HUH.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.696
AND THIS MUST BE YOUR AUNT MEL.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.765
SHE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE
KICKING AND SCREAMING.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.667
( laughs ) INSIDE.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.835
LENNOX, I WANT YOU TO MEET
SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.604
THIS IS LI-CHONG AND NALA.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.606
WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS SHOW
LENNOX YOUR PORTFOLIOS

03:25.639 --> 03:27.308
SO SHE CAN SEE THE
WORK THAT WE DO HERE?

03:27.341 --> 03:30.478
- THANK YOU.
- HEY.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.912
YOUR NIECE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY

03:31.945 --> 03:33.781
YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND
IN GIRLS HER AGE.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.783
YOU MEAN AN AUNT
WITH A CHECKBOOK?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.652
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN $500
FOR A TRAINING COURSE?

03:38.686 --> 03:40.888
I DON'T CHARGE THE GIRLS
THAT I SCOUT MYSELF.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.657
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE
FLY-BY-NIGHT AGENCIES

03:43.691 --> 03:45.426
THAT BILK NAIVE,
HOPELESS WANNABES

03:45.459 --> 03:46.727
OUT OF THEIR SWEET-16 MONEY.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.363
( laughing ) YEAH, HOW PATHETIC.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.632
NALA'S PORTFOLIO WAS AMAZING.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.701
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT
AFTER THE LAST SHOOT

03:53.734 --> 03:56.270
THEY DONATED ALL THE CLOTHES
TO A HOMELESS SHELTER.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.206
WOW, I HOPE ALL THE
HOMELESS ARE A SIZE ZERO.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.409
YOU KNOW, LENNOX, I SENT A
COUPLE OF THOSE PICTURES

04:01.442 --> 04:03.511
THAT I TOOK OF YOU AT THE
MALL TO A DEPARTMENT STORE.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.346
THEY EXPRESSED INTEREST.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.715
YOU HEAR THAT, AUNT MEL?
I HAVE INTEREST!

04:07.748 --> 04:09.517
I KNOW THIS IS ALL
VERY EXCITING,

04:09.550 --> 04:10.818
BUT AREN'T WE RUSHING IT?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.686
LENNOX DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT MODELING.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.655
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SMILE
AND WEAR A SWEATER?

04:14.688 --> 04:17.591
- YEP.
- WE'RE GOOD.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.296
TODAY WAS THE DAY, JOE.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.765
I WALKED UP THAT
LINE YOU GAVE ME: ED

04:24.798 --> 04:28.402
YOU LOOK LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT'S
PRETTIER SISTER, ONLY PRETTIER.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.639
THAT'S A VINTAGE
LONGO RIGHT THERE.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.774
BACK IN THE DAY IT
WAS ALYSSA MILANO.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.844
WHO?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.313
ANYWAY, SHE BLUSHED
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.781
DID YOU ASK HER SOMETHING
PERSONAL ABOUT HERSELF

04:40.814 --> 04:42.650
AND THEN FURROW YOUR BROW
LIKE YOU WERE LISTENING?

04:42.683 --> 04:46.286
YEAH, I FURROWED SO
HARD, I POPPED A ZIT.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.722
WAY TO COMMIT, BUDDY.
WAY TO COMMIT.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.324
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW YOUR NEXT MOVE

04:50.358 --> 04:52.393
IS TO INVITE HER
FOR A STUDY DATE.

04:52.426 --> 04:56.497
- MY HOUSE?
- NO, YOUR BEACH HOUSE, PLAYER.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.499
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN
STUDYING FOR A WHILE,

04:58.532 --> 05:00.334
YOU TURN TO HER AND YOU
SAY, "ARE YOU HUNGRY?

05:00.368 --> 05:02.269
BECAUSE I JUST HAPPEN
TO HAVE A PIZZA MADE

05:02.302 --> 05:04.772
COURTESY OF MY BEST BUDDY
JOE." AND THEN YOU SUGGEST

05:04.805 --> 05:07.741
WATCHING A DVD FROM THE VINTAGE
LONGO MOVIE COLLECTION.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.677
SO NOW YOU'RE OVER ON THE COUCH.
YOU DIM THE LIGHTS.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.512
YOU SLIDE YOUR ARM AROUND HER.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.515
THAT, MY YOUNG SQUIRE, IS THE BEGINNING
OF WHAT WE CALL A SERIOUS DATE.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.784
I'M GONNA ASK HOLLY
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.652
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SHAVE?

05:18.686 --> 05:21.321
UH, YEAH.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.291
YEAH, THAT ONE CRAZY
HAIR ON YOUR CHIN THERE

05:24.324 --> 05:26.293
DEFINITELY NEEDS CUTTING.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.829
OH, WAIT A MINUTE. NO,
THAT WAS AN EYELASH.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.369
HEY, I HEARD THE GOOD NEWS.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.471
LENNOX IS GONNA BE DOING
A LITTLE PHOTO SHOOT?

05:37.505 --> 05:40.040
IT'S AN OFFER. I HAVEN'T DECIDED
WHETHER I'LL LET HER MAKE

05:40.073 --> 05:42.743
THIS TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE,
LIFE-ALTERING MISTAKE.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.579
YOU KNOW, BURKE, MOST
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT THINGS

05:45.613 --> 05:48.048
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, BUT NOT YOU.

05:48.081 --> 05:52.052
HEY, LOOK, IT ALL STARTS WITH ONE INNOCENT
PHOTO SHOOT. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

05:52.085 --> 05:54.688
THEY'RE FLYING YOU AROUND THE
WORLD, PAYING YOU GOBS OF MONEY.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.924
AND FOR WHAT? STANDING
THERE IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.992
WITH WINGS?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.429
I JUST DON'T WANT LENNOX
GOING OFF THE TRACK.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.464
I DON'T WANT HER TO
VEER OFF AND BECOME...

06:03.497 --> 06:06.534
WHAT, HAPPY? INDEPENDENT?
HER OWN PERSON?

06:06.567 --> 06:10.571
SHALLOW, NAKED, LEO
DICAPRIO'S ARM CANDY.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.074
LOOK, I INVESTED A LOT
IN THESE KIDS, OKAY?

06:14.107 --> 06:16.109
I'VE MADE SACRIFICES
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

06:16.143 --> 06:19.379
- I JUST HAVE TO PROTECT LENNOX.
- FROM WHAT?

06:19.413 --> 06:20.914
HEY, AUNT MEL, TASHA NEEDS YOU

06:20.948 --> 06:23.016
TO SIGN THIS CONTRACT
FOR THE SHOOT TOMORROW.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.654
AHA. FROM THIS... I WANNA
PROTECT HER FROM THIS.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.356
HEY, BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU'RE POINTING
THAT THING. LET ME SEE THIS.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.692
OH BOY, THIS TAKES ME BACK.
GOD, WHEN I WORKED AT SCANLON

06:31.725 --> 06:33.894
I'D POUND THROUGH FOUR OR
FIVE OF THESE BABIES A DAY,

06:33.927 --> 06:36.096
EXAMINING THE FINE PRINT,
LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES,

06:36.129 --> 06:38.599
WORKING LATE INTO THE NIGHT.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.668
- GOD, I MISS MY OLD LIFE.
- SO WHAT DOES IT SAY?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.770
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA
PAY HER, LIKE A BUCK?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.473
- YEAH, 750 OF THEM.
- HOLY CRAP!

06:45.506 --> 06:47.708
JUST FOR STANDING THERE
IN A FUZZY TURTLENECK?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.977
I GUESS I HAVE WHAT
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR...

06:50.010 --> 06:52.480
A FACE AND A NECK.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.947
JEEZ, BURKE, WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?

06:53.981 --> 06:56.717
I MEAN IT'S ALL GOING
HORRIBLY TERRIBLY FINE!

06:58.452 --> 07:00.688
( dance music playing )

07:00.721 --> 07:02.723
SMILE, LADIES.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.892
I REALLY THINK SHE COULD
HAVE A CAREER DOING THIS.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.894
LENNOX JUST POPS ON CAMERA.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.997
THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT, BUT
SHE'S GONNA POP INTO COLLEGE.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.701
- MODELING IS HOW I PUT MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE.
- WHAT?

07:13.734 --> 07:17.104
LIKE REAL COLLEGE OR LIKE ONE
OF THOSE INTERNET DEALS?

07:17.137 --> 07:19.439
BIG STONE BUILDING WITH
A SIGN ON THE FRONT

07:19.473 --> 07:20.908
THAT READ "PRINCETON."

07:20.941 --> 07:22.843
WOW, AND YOUR AUNT
DIDN'T HAVE TO...

07:22.876 --> 07:25.479
I MEAN YOUR FAMILY DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY TUITION?

07:25.513 --> 07:28.482
NO, AND MY FATHER WAS PRETTY
HAPPY, I HAVE TO SAY.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.686
SMILE, BABY. THE
CAMERA LOVES YOU.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.733
- ( whistling )
- HEY, MONEY GUY.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.870
ME? WOW, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

07:49.903 --> 07:51.939
SINCE SOMEBODY'S CALLED ME THAT.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.042
- SAY IT AGAIN, SLOWLY.
- NO.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.010
NOW COME OVER HERE AND
TELL ME WHICH ONE

07:57.044 --> 07:59.446
OF THESE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
WOULD MAKE MOST SENSE FOR LENNOX.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.915
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU NEED TO
LOOK FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES

08:01.949 --> 08:04.618
AND THE EXPENSE RATIOS AND
ALL THE COMMISSIONS AND...

08:04.652 --> 08:07.154
ALL RIGHT, BRAIN SHUTTING DOWN.
JUST PICK ONE.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.057
HERE, GO WITH THIS ONE.
IT'S GOT SHINY PAPER.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.994
TASHA SEEMS TO THINK LENNOX CAN
PUT HERSELF THROUGH COLLEGE

08:14.027 --> 08:15.896
WITH THE MONEY SHE'S GONNA
MAKE FROM MODELING.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.566
SO WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE GONNA
LET HER GO THROUGH WITH IT NOW?

08:18.599 --> 08:22.035
MUST BE NICE NOT TO WORRY ABOUT
THINGS YOU SAID 10 MINUTES AGO.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.938
LENNOX SAID SHE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE HOUSEHOLD, YOU KNOW?

08:24.972 --> 08:27.007
AND IF SHE'S ABLE TO PAY
FOR HER OWN COLLEGE,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.009
THEN I CAN TAKE THE MONEY
I WAS SAVING FOR THAT

08:29.042 --> 08:32.012
AND PUT IT TOWARDS MORE
WORTHWHILE PROJECTS.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.015
UH, IS THAT A BATHROOM?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.184
UH, IT'S CONSIDERABLY
MORE THAN A BATHROOM...

08:37.217 --> 08:39.186
WHIRLPOOL TUB, STEAM SHOWER,

08:39.219 --> 08:44.024
TOWEL WARMER, A
MEMORY-FOAM TOILET SEAT.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.794
JUST LIKE THE ONE DOWN
AT THE GAS STATION.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.929
IT'S A DREAM DEFERRED.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.263
SO THIS WAS YOUR BIG
SACRIFICE, HUH?

08:50.297 --> 08:55.035
YOU GAVE UP YOUR DELUXE CUSTOM
CRAPPER THAT MEMORIZES YOUR BUTT?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.871
OKAY, IT'S A HOME-SPA OASIS AND
I WAS HAPPY TO GIVE IT UP.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.007
BUT NOW THAT LENNOX CAN
PAY FOR HER OWN COLLEGE,

09:00.040 --> 09:03.977
I CAN FINALLY BUILD TARA.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.947
YOU NAMED YOUR POTTY TARA?

09:06.980 --> 09:10.050
YOU MAY THINK IT'S SILLY,
BUT FRANKLY, LONGO,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.119
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

09:17.925 --> 09:22.162
- YOU'RE STARING AT ME AGAIN, RYDER.
- OH, SORRY.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.737
AHEM, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, HOLLY,

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
BUT STUDYING MAKES ME HUNGRY.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.843
I JUST GOT AN IDEA JUST NOW.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.712
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE A PIZZA
WHILE WE WATCH A MOVIE?

09:38.746 --> 09:41.649
WELL, LIKE, WHAT MOVIE?

09:41.682 --> 09:45.285
I HAVE A WHOLE COLLECTION OF
ACADEMY-AWARD-WINNING BEST PICTURES.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.857
OLD MOVIES?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.092
LIKE WITH THE BIG GORILLA
THAT CLIMBS THE EIFFEL TOWER

09:52.125 --> 09:55.062
AND SAYS, "WE'LL
ALWAYS HAVE PARIS"?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.664
( scoffs ) WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.634
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
PIZZA'S ALMOST READY.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.170
WE CAN WATCH SOMETHING ON TV.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.338
I LIKE SEEING PEOPLE
GETTING HUMILIATED

10:05.372 --> 10:07.007
AND VOTED OFF THINGS. DON'T YOU?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.643
OH, YEAH. FO' SHO'.

10:11.645 --> 10:15.048
- DON'T USE WORDS THAT AREN'T WORDS.
- NEVER AGAIN.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.784
HAVE I GOT A TREAT FOR YOU TWO.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.052
HERE WE GO. YEAH.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.990
- WHAT ARE THOSE CIRCLY THINGS?
- THOSE ARE OLIVES.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.259
- I DON'T LIKE OLIVES.
- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THEM?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.896
NO, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.732
I'LL PICK THEM OFF FOR YOU...

10:31.765 --> 10:34.167
WITHOUT RUINING THIS
MAGNIFICENT PIE.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.336
NO, BUT IT'LL STILL
HAVE OLIVE POO ON IT.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.239
- BESIDES, IT LOOKS REALLY GREASY.
- GREASY?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.241
I THINK IT'S JUST SHINY.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.778
WELL, IT'S SHINY
BECAUSE IT'S GREASY.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.281
OKAY, SO NO SHINY,
GREASY, OLIVEY

10:48.315 --> 10:50.083
FOUR-HOURS-IN-THE-MAKING
PIZZA THEN.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.653
SO THE TV'S IN THERE.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.126
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JOE.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.695
HEH, WOMEN, HUH?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.200
- HERE YOU GO.
- PIZZA FOR BREAKFAST?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.202
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.072
WOW, JOE, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.241
DAMN STRAIGHT IT IS.
IS THAT GREASY?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.176
- YOU SEE ANY GREASE ON THERE?
- NO, IT'S FINE.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.679
YEAH? NOT TOO MUCH OLIVE POO?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.915
HEY, RYDER, THERE'S
PIZZA FOR BREAKFAST.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.884
- YOU WANT SOME?
- I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.386
DUDE, NUT UP. SHE'S
NOT EVEN HERE.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.388
SHE'LL KNOW. OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:28.421 --> 11:31.992
I'M GONNA TAKE ONE PIECE AND
THEN TAKE ANOTHER SHOWER.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.095
NEVER SEEN A GUY CHEAT ON A GIRL
BEFORE WITH A SLICE OF PIZZA.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.799
HEY, SOMEBODY WE KNOW HAS
AN AD IN TODAY'S PAPER.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.401
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT... IT'S
NOT A CITY COUNCILWOMAN

11:41.434 --> 11:44.071
OR A SMART-ASS KNOW-IT-ALL
WHO WORKS FOR ME.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.741
BURKE, I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.777
OH MY GOD, MY FIRST AD!

11:49.810 --> 11:53.180
THERE SHE IS, MY NIECE.
THAT'S YOU.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.949
- WELL, MOSTLY ME.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.985
WELL, THAT'S MY FACE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

11:58.018 --> 11:59.352
WHO THAT IS FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.288
THEY MADE MY THIGHS
THE SIZE OF MY ARMS.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.858
IT'S EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT.
THAT'S LIKE RYDER'S ARMS.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.027
HEY, COME ON, THEY TOUCH
UP PHOTOS ALL THE TIME.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.097
I MEAN, HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE PICTURE
OF ME ON THE CITY COUNCIL WEBSITE?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.365
I DIDN'T COMPLAIN THAT THEY
AIRBRUSHED ME UP A CUP

12:12.399 --> 12:14.067
WITH LITTLE TO NO PRODDING.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.869
MODELING IS A MEANS TO AN END.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.437
IT'LL GET YOU THE THINGS
YOU WANT IN LIFE.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.073
YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.909
YEAH YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.911
IT'S GONNA GET ME MY MINI.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.047
( laughs ) YOUR
MINISKIRT FOR COLLEGE?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.983
MY MINI COOPER. SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BUY IT FOR ME.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.285
I CAN SHOW YOU THE VIRTUAL
ONE I DESIGNED ONLINE.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.956
- HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN PARK IT IN MEL'S VIRTUAL BATHROOM.
- OKAY, HOLD IT.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.126
SEE, LENNOX, YOU'RE USING YOUR
MODELING MONEY FOR COLLEGE

12:39.159 --> 12:42.029
BECAUSE THAT'S THE PLAN
WE ALL HAD IN MY MIND.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.031
THAT'S SO NICE OF
YOU, BURKE, TO TAKE

12:44.064 --> 12:47.034
ALL OF THE BOTHERSOME THINKING AND
DECIDING OFF OF LENNOX'S HANDS.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.202
AUNT MEL, I HAVE
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.272
FIRST IT'S THE CAR, THEN A YEAR
IN EUROPE AND THEN COLLEGE.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.974
OR NOT.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.176
OOH, I COULD OPEN MY
OWN ANIMAL SANCTUARY

12:56.209 --> 12:57.911
AND LIVE ON A BOAT.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.113
NO, A FLOATING ANIMAL SANCTUARY.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.249
OKAY, LENNOX, SLOW DOWN.
I APPRECIATE THAT...

13:02.282 --> 13:04.017
NO NO NO, I APPRECIATE YOU.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.053
THANKS FOR CONVINCING
ME NOT TO FREAK OUT

13:06.086 --> 13:07.520
ABOUT THE WHOLE AIRBRUSH THING.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.156
LIKE YOU SAID, BIG PICTURE.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.330
OKAY, SHE IS WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE MAKING
THESE KINDS OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.500
SAYS THE YOUNGEST COUNCILPERSON EVER
ELECTED IN THIS CITY'S HISTORY.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.435
OH SURE, JUST THROW MY
SUCCESS IN MY FACE.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.105
- I THINK I JUST DID.
- YOU KNOW, DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.375
- WANT ME TO AIRBRUSH IT?
- LIKE YOU OWN A BRUSH.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.989
BUT I DIDN'T WAVE TO
ZACK IN THE HALL.

13:42.022 --> 13:46.359
THEN WHAT WAS THIS? JAZZ HANDS?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.896
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
YOU WOULD ONLY TALK

13:48.929 --> 13:51.164
TO THE APPROVED LIST
OF FRIENDS I GAVE YOU.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.565
THIS IS FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD, RYDER.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.335
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.171
YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO
MUSIC, PLAY THE WII,

13:58.205 --> 14:01.308
WATCH JUSTIN BIEBER BLOW
HIS HAIR OUT OF HIS EYES?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.845
I'M GOING TO I.M. MY FRIENDS.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.249
BUT I THOUGHT YOU CAME OVER SO
WE COULD DO SOMETHING TOGETHER.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.884
WELL, WE ARE.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.453
SEE, YOU'LL SIT
HERE WHILE I TEXT.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
OKAY.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.060
- SO WHO ARE YOU TEXT...
- SHH!

14:22.495 --> 14:25.498
( mouthing words )

14:32.505 --> 14:35.308
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M JUST GONNA GET A SNACK.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.277
NOTHING CRUNCHY.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.279
DUDE, COME HERE, COME HERE.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.314
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT
THIS TO YOU DELICATELY,

14:41.348 --> 14:44.384
BUT SHE IS KILLING YOU, BRO, OKAY?
SHE HAS SPAYED AND NEUTERED YOU.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.153
HOW MUCH MORE ARE YOU
GONNA STAND FOR?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.588
I LIKE HER AND SHE LIKES ME.

14:48.621 --> 14:52.425
WHAT PART OF YOU DOES SHE LIKE?

14:52.459 --> 14:57.330
SHE LIKES MY, UH...
SHE LIKES IT WHEN...

14:57.364 --> 15:00.133
SHE LIKES THE WAY I
DON'T FIGHT BACK.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.969
WHAT ARE YOU, MARRIED?
LISTEN, RYDER...

15:02.002 --> 15:03.436
I KNOW, JOE! I KNOW!

15:03.470 --> 15:06.306
HELP ME, JOE. HELP ME.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.276
OKAY, AHEM.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.644
OKAY, LOOK, THERE IS
AN EXIT STRATEGY.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.185
HOLLY, I THINK YOU'RE
UNBELIEVABLY PRETTY.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.187
WELL, YEAH.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.189
AND IT'S SO COOL THAT
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH ME.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.692
- OH STOP.
- BUT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

15:27.194 --> 15:30.263
LET ME PUT THIS IN
REALITY SHOW TERMS.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.065
AMERICA HAS SPOKEN.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.602
I'M VOTING MYSELF OUT
OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

15:35.635 --> 15:39.472
AW, THAT IS SO CUTE, BUT
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.209
LOOK, HOLLY, I'M NOT KIDDING.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.244
IT'S JUST...

15:47.514 --> 15:49.649
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

15:49.682 --> 15:53.453
LEMONADE, AND NOT THAT
HIDEOUS POWDERED STUFF.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.488
YEAH, I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO YOU.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.625
I'M SORRY, JOE.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.693
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I WAS TALKING TO HER.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.395
I WAS SAYING EVERYTHING YOU SAID

16:02.429 --> 16:04.131
AND THEN THERE WERE THESE LIPS...
TWO OF THEM.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.933
AND I THINK I BLACKED OUT.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.536
I MEAN ALL THE BLOOD IN MY
BRAIN WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.272
YEAH, I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT
YOU TO WIN THAT ONE ANYWAY.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.007
WOMEN DON'T FIGHT FAIR.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.177
- BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, I DID GET YOU KISSED.
- YEAH YOU DID.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.447
THAT TOOK A LOT OF WORK.
DOES IT GET ANY EASIER?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.950
IF BY EASIER YOU
MEAN SOUL-CRUSHING

16:23.983 --> 16:25.452
AND EXPENSIVE, THEN YEAH.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.623
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE IN
WARDROBE ON THEIR MARKS.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.992
AND LET'S HAVE SOME BIG SMILES.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.461
IT WAS A GREAT DAY ON THE SLOPES

16:34.494 --> 16:37.497
AND YOU'RE ALL EXCITED
ABOUT HAVING HOT COCOA

16:37.530 --> 16:39.766
WHILE YOU... HIT ON EACH OTHER.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.335
THIS COAT IS AMAZING.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.970
HOW DO THEY MAKE IT
FEEL LIKE REAL FUR?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.140
IT'S A SPECIAL PROCESS WHERE
THEY KILL A REAL ANIMAL.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.976
YOU MEAN THIS ISN'T FAKE?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.479
NOPE, IT'S REALLY DEAD.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.282
AND NOW, BOYS AND GIRLS, I
WANNA SEE A LOT OF POINTING,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.350
WINKING AND GOOD TIMES.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.386
FEEL FREE TO LET
YOUR MINDS GO BLANK.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.755
( camera clicking )

17:02.789 --> 17:05.525
YOU, FROWNY GIRL.

17:05.558 --> 17:10.063
I WAS JUST WONDERING, COULD I
TALK TO TASHA FOR A MOMENT?

17:10.097 --> 17:12.999
SURE, WHY NOT? IT'S NOT
LIKE ANYONE'S BUSY WORKING.

17:13.032 --> 17:17.070
- I'M STARVED.
- YEAH WELL, YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK HERE.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.005
THIS IS ALL THE STUFF I
PICKED OUT OF MY SALAD.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.674
NO, THESE BEAN SPROUTS
ARE REALLY GOOD.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.410
I PRETEND THEY'RE FRENCH FRIES.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.011
THAT'S FUNNY. I EAT FRENCH FRIES

17:25.044 --> 17:27.080
AND PRETEND THEY'RE
BEAN SPROUTS.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.515
WELL LOOK, IT IS A GOOD THING

17:28.548 --> 17:31.418
THAT JOE PACKED
LENNOX A SANDWICH.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.786
WELL, HALF A SANDWICH.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.424
OH GOD. IS THAT BREAD?

17:39.159 --> 17:41.528
PUT THAT AWAY.
SOMEBODY'LL SEE IT.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.430
HOW ABOUT IF I HIDE
IT IN MY STOMACH?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.534
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T
WANNA ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

17:47.567 --> 17:49.436
TO BUY STUFF WITH
REAL FUR, DO WE?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.438
OF COURSE NOT, BUT
THE CLIENT DOES.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.173
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THEM HAPPY.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.508
SO FORGET ABOUT THAT DEAD
ANIMAL AROUND YOUR NECK

17:55.542 --> 17:57.477
AND GO FROLIC IN THE SNOW.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.379
CAN I AT LEAST WEAR
SOMETHING ELSE,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.080
LIKE MAYBE ONE OF THE SWEATERS?

18:01.114 --> 18:03.250
NO, THOSE ARE PRETTY FITTED.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.551
WE WANTED TO PUT
YOU IN THE JACKET

18:04.584 --> 18:06.786
BECAUSE IT'S MORE FLATTERING
FOR YOUR BODY TYPE.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.589
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BODY TYPE?
- NOTHING.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.358
BUT THIS IS A BIG JOB

18:11.391 --> 18:14.561
AND THEY LIKE THE THINNER GIRLS.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.465
CAN WE SHOOT THIS BEFORE
MY HAPPY PILLS WEAR OFF?

18:18.498 --> 18:21.234
I JUST... CAN I JUST
HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.735
YEAH.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.437
AUNT MEL, LOOK AT THIS.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.073
- OOH, IT'S SO SOFT.
- IT'S REAL FUR.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.475
OH, IT'S SO WRONG!

18:28.508 --> 18:30.443
CAN'T THEY PUT YOU IN ONE
OF THE OTHER OUTFITS?

18:30.477 --> 18:33.413
I ASKED, BUT SEE, THEY SAID THEY
HAD TO KEEP ME IN THIS FUR BURKA

18:33.446 --> 18:35.081
ON ACCOUNT OF ME BEING ENORMOUS.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.318
- REALLY? THEY SAID THAT?
- WELL, IN SO MANY WORDS.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.221
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT HOW
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

18:41.254 --> 18:45.358
I WANT A CAR AND AN ANIMAL
SHELTER AND COLLEGE.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.127
AND THIS WHOLE THING'S JUST
STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE CREEPY.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.664
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
- WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?

18:51.698 --> 18:55.268
I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO. YOU...

18:55.302 --> 18:57.470
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOUR
OWN DECISION, KIDDO.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.139
AW MAN, THE ONE TIME I ASK
YOU TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.441
IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

19:01.474 --> 19:05.578
CAN WE GET A COUPLE SHOTS
BEFORE THESE KIDS NEED BOTOX?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.149
OKAY, YOU'RE HAPPY.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.686
YOU'RE HORMONAL. YOU'RE
AMERICA'S TEENAGERS.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.423
( camera clicking )

19:16.456 --> 19:19.192
THERE'S THE SMILE I
WAS LOOKING FOR.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.861
YEAH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.198
- THIS IS NOT WHO I AM.
- LENNOX, SWEETIE,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.434
NO ONE CARES WHO YOU ARE.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.470
WHEN YOU'RE A MODEL, YOU CAN'T
PICK AND CHOOSE THE JOBS YOU WANT.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.171
YOU WEAR WHAT THEY
TELL YOU TO WEAR.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.207
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A
CAREER ANY OTHER WAY.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.510
OH, I'LL HAVE A CAREER,
JUST NOT THIS ONE.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.246
BYE.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.148
- COULD YOU GIVE ME A LIFT HOME?
- OF COURSE.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.652
OH, BUT FIRST THERE'S
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.688
- HERE, EAT! LIVE!
- Tasha: NO! STOP!

19:51.291 --> 19:53.526
NO, STOP! DON'T FEED THE MODELS.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.928
WAIT, I HAVE JELLYBEANS TOO!
SUGAR!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.536
( sighs ) TO TARA.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.239
I GUESS YOU AND I JUST
WEREN'T MEANT TO BE.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.807
AW.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.543
ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH
YOUR IMAGINARY TOILET?

20:10.577 --> 20:14.681
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WRITE A...
YOU KNOW, A "DEAR JOHN" LETTER?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.916
LENNOX ISN'T MODELING ANYMORE,

20:16.949 --> 20:18.585
SO I'M BACK TO
PAYING FOR COLLEGE.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.388
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN
THINK I REALLY HELPED HER.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.756
SURE, YOU DID. YOU GAVE HER SOME
SPACE TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF

20:23.790 --> 20:25.492
AND SHE REALIZED IT
WASN'T THE RIGHT THING.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.361
NOT ENOUGH.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.963
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.199
YOU WERE RIGHT FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.703
SAY IT AGAIN, SLOWLY.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.573
OKAY, YOU TOLD
LENNOX THAT MODELING

20:40.607 --> 20:42.642
PROBABLY WASN'T THE
BEST IDEA FOR HER.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.244
AND YOU, MEL BURKE,
WERE 100% CORRECT.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.314
YOU JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE
ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN ADVICE.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.615
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME I WAS WRONG.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.484
- YOU SHOULD LEARN TO TUNE ME OUT.
- REALLY?

20:51.518 --> 20:53.320
NO, NOT REALLY. YOU SHOULD
LISTEN TO ME AT ALL TIMES...

20:53.353 --> 20:55.221
EXCEPT WHEN IT
COMES TO MODELING.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.489
SO THAT'S YOUR ONE WEAK SPOT?

20:56.523 --> 20:58.425
YES. OTHERWISE I REALLY
DO KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.361
- OH, SO WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
- NOT A CLUE.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.370
WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GETTING VOTED OFF...

21:10.403 --> 21:11.871
THE ANGRY GIRL
WITH THE NOSE RING

21:11.904 --> 21:13.373
OR THE BITTER GUY
WHO'S BEEN NAKED?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.975
SHH, I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
WITH ALL OF YOUR BLABBING.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.010
SORRY.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.682
- CAN I HOLD YOUR HAND?
- FINE, WHATEVER.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.485
BUT LIGHT PRESSURE.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.488
AND SIT UP STRAIGHT.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.491
SLOUCHING GIVES YOU
AN OLD MAN POUCH.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.628
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
- I KNOW, SHE'S FEISTY.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.398
I LIKE HER.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.433
