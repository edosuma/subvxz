Has it occurred to you that maybe Andy knocking on the door

11:24.767 --> 11:26.269
is the reason that I woke up?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.855
Or maybe I had to study.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.315
So which is it?

11:30.357 --> 11:31.483
Pick one.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.694
That.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.031
Oh, you mean, um, the passive

11:38.072 --> 11:39.949
See, I'm just trying not to kill you

11:39.991 --> 11:42.410
for smearing your mental breakdown all over me.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.037
If I make it all the way over there

11:44.078 --> 11:45.622
and those stupid-ass glasses

11:45.664 --> 11:47.207
are still on that stupid-ass face,

11:47.248 --> 11:49.292
I'm gonna break them into tiny pieces

11:49.334 --> 11:52.003
and shove each and every one up your self-righteous --

11:52.045 --> 11:55.298
If you so much as touch

11:55.340 --> 11:57.050
my very excellent glasses,

11:57.091 --> 11:58.885
I'm gonna beat you until my arms go numb,

11:58.926 --> 12:00.470
at which point, the kicking will commence.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.720
Is that right?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.223
'Cause you look pretty hungover.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.765
I'm sure I could take you.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.476
Okay. All right.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.769
Try it. I dare you.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.616
-Don't. Don't. -I'm not.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.244
-Don't cry. -I'm trying not to.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.496
That is not fair, okay?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.830
Is it working?

12:32.335 --> 12:33.920
Get over here.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.718
Come here.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.183
Um, so is this just about Andy?

12:49.603 --> 12:52.063
No. It's about me.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.692
I just think Andy was collateral damage.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.111
That's a -- That's a pithy line.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.404
You care to elaborate?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.286
Oh, man.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.997
So...last night,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.875
I had the first threesome of my life.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.755
It was pretty amazing.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.214
Actually, I need a better word for that

13:18.256 --> 13:20.550
'cause I use that for, like, sour Jelly Bellys

13:20.592 --> 13:23.511
and boots and pretty much everything else.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.347
This was like --

13:26.389 --> 13:27.848
like transformative.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.101
I'm -- I'm pretty sure my hair had an orgasm.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.145
-Okay.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.897
So, you got it on with your aunt and uncle.

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
Whoo-hoo.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.942
Please stop calling them that.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.320
Okay. So you and this -- this married couple

13:40.361 --> 13:41.655
that you're dating.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.072
That's -- That's the thing.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.199
That's the problem. Like, we're not dating.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.494
We're not becoming anything, like a throuple,

13:47.535 --> 13:48.995
or whatever the fuck you call it.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.288
I don't know. We're just like --

13:50.330 --> 13:53.792
Yeah. You're a business arrangement.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.670
Not anymore.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.046
What?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.716
I kind of ripped up the check.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.261
You -- I --

14:05.303 --> 14:08.847
Okay. I must have, like, premium vodka in my ears

14:08.889 --> 14:10.350
because I swear that you just said

14:10.391 --> 14:11.601
that you ripped up the check.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.935
That's crazy.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.438
Yeah, 'cause I'm not a prostitute, so...

14:15.480 --> 14:16.731
Oh.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.233
Okay. So, then, what are you?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.402
Well, uh, I guess, at this point,

14:21.444 --> 14:23.279
I'm just...

14:23.321 --> 14:26.658
their booty call?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.908
I don't know.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.621
Hey, those assholes, they led you on.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.873
They -- They made you think

14:33.914 --> 14:37.502
that it could become something that it's not,

14:37.544 --> 14:39.546
which makes you a fucking idiot, no offense.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.716
How is that not offensive?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.759
You're their Andy, okay?

14:44.801 --> 14:48.221
Their plaything, someone that you keep "on simmer."

14:48.262 --> 14:49.764
So what? You're suggesting what,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.432
like karmic justice here, or something?

14:51.474 --> 14:54.977
Yeah. I mean, if the asshat fits, then wear it.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.731
I get you're trying to do like the tough-love thing here,

14:57.772 --> 15:00.066
but, like, you really suck at this.

15:00.107 --> 15:03.069
Or am I amazing, nay, transformative, right?

15:03.110 --> 15:04.195
-You're not. -Yes, I am.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.446
You are absolutely not.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.989
I am good at this.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.076
I am the cold, hard truth, Izzy.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.078
Maybe the cold and the hard.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.788
Aw.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.624
I'm gonna miss this when you're institutionalized,

15:16.666 --> 15:18.752
when they lock you up.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.921
The banter. We're so good at it.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.339
I love you.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.301
I love you, too.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.931
And I...

15:31.972 --> 15:35.351
fucked Andy, um... and I got to go.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.022
Bye.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.944
It's gonna take me a second

15:44.985 --> 15:47.781
to digest all this information.

15:47.822 --> 15:48.989
Looks like it's gonna take you a month

15:49.031 --> 15:50.909
to digest that crepe-wrapped cow.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.537
That's so gross, man.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.456
-Healthy stuff.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.499
Hmm? With your special sauce of estrogen

15:58.541 --> 16:00.376
and your big brother's disappointment?

16:00.418 --> 16:01.669
Can you, like, close your mouth?

16:01.711 --> 16:02.962
There's people here that don't --

16:03.003 --> 16:05.381
Enjoy your life, dude, okay?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.425
Swallow it whole. -I am.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.677
And stop surviving.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.846
Start living.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.848
I am living.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.349
You're saying I shouldn't be afraid

16:15.391 --> 16:17.560
of going public with Izzy?

16:17.602 --> 16:20.146
Should just kind of like show her as we are

16:20.187 --> 16:22.440
and

16:22.482 --> 16:23.691
-Jesus! -Ow.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.487
Listen, you dumbass.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.071
You and Emma are not gonna openly

16:29.113 --> 16:30.490
add a third person to your marriage

16:30.531 --> 16:32.116
and flaunt that shit all over Portland!

16:32.158 --> 16:33.451
Well, keep your fucking voice down.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.536
Let alone anywhere near my family.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.204
Jesus, you're so riled up over this.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.623
-God. -It's my life.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.333
Look. You're gonna lose your job, okay?

16:40.374 --> 16:42.001
The three of you are gonna be a freak show.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.003
You're gonna be on "Good Morning, America."

16:44.044 --> 16:46.840
People are gonna throw fake blood on you

16:46.881 --> 16:48.299
in the streets! -Why would --

16:48.341 --> 16:49.801
First of all, keep your fucking voice down, okay?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.344
Don't tell me fucking what to do.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.346
Secondly, why would they be throwing fake blood on us?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.722
What are we, like we have furs on or something?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.307
-Whatever. -Think about what you're saying.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.100
-Whatever. -Your analogies make no sense.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.519
Listen, okay?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.729
You're gonna endure public ridicule.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.481
You're gonna be cast out.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.692
You're going to be a weirdo.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.528
W

17:08.569 --> 17:10.196
Not Afghanistan.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.616
Dude, we're even, by the way. Okay? 1-1. Truce.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.452
♪♪

17:16.494 --> 17:18.579
Nina: This isn't fun sober!

17:18.621 --> 17:19.706
It's not supposed to be fun, Nina!

17:19.747 --> 17:20.790
I'm kicking your ass!

17:20.832 --> 17:21.916
Ow!

17:21.958 --> 17:23.001
Ow. Ow.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.044
Are you

17:25.085 --> 17:26.212
No. Ow. No, no, no.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.881
Not the hands. Not the hands.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.841
Don't you dare. You do that,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.175
you're gonna have to kill me first.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.343
Ah!

17:32.385 --> 17:34.554
Ah! Ow, my boob!

17:34.595 --> 17:37.015
-Yeah. -Ow.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.558
Ow! I can't breathe.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.560
Roommates who break girl code

17:40.601 --> 17:42.436
do not get oxygen!

17:42.478 --> 17:44.480
Ow. Ow.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.648
Ow.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.441
-Give it to me. -No, no, no, no.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.526
Ow, ow, ow. Not my hand.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.110
-Oh. Oh, my God! -Drop it.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
Stop hitting yourself. Oh, my God! You're crazy!

17:51.654 --> 17:53.614
Not my nipple! You know that they're sensitive!

17:53.656 --> 17:55.157
Aaaah! Tater Tots!

17:55.199 --> 17:56.910
-No safe words. -Tater Tots!

17:56.951 --> 17:58.995
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't punch you

17:59.037 --> 18:01.664
in the vag right now.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.042
I smoked way too much weed for this.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.460
Timeout. Timeout.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.050
Oh, my boob.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.894
He brought the really good vodka, Iz.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.604
And his dick?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.230
Point being, he was on a mission, okay?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.732
Yeah, duh.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.859
You couldn't intuit that, future psychologist?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.778
Yeah, you'd think, but it only occurred to me

18:31.819 --> 18:34.447
soon after my first orgasm.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.698
Your first?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.450
Kid's got game.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.956
Of course he does.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.292
Never stuck around long enough to find out.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.545
Blew it with a good guy, who's also nondouchey,

18:49.587 --> 18:52.757
handsome, and, apparently, screws like a porn star.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.134
This is good. This is -- This is good.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.510
Everything's working out.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.724
It was a mistake, okay?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.017
We both agreed,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.770
and he's still yours for the having...

19:05.812 --> 19:08.272
if you want him.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.151
He's -- He's pissed, but he'll get over it.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.487
Did you hear me?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.156
Loud and clear.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.408
No one is gonna let their daughter be counseled

19:19.450 --> 19:22.036
by an infamous sexual deviant.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.621
Come on.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.749
Why couldn't you have just kept it in a box, hmm?

19:26.791 --> 19:27.959
We tried.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.836
You know, the occasional kinky fun

19:29.877 --> 19:32.713
behind closed doors.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.381
Listen, man,

19:34.423 --> 19:38.678
we love having you guys over, right, you know that?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.471
But you know that Marie's

19:40.513 --> 19:43.349
never gonna be okay with this.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.853
Nobody is. Hmm?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.354
Just look in their eyes.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.856
You know what?

19:49.897 --> 19:51.774
We should've insisted she keep the money.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.609
That put a label on things.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.737
Now, the whole arrangement is just so ambiguous.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.072
You're damn right it is.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.699
It's time to take that genie

19:59.740 --> 20:01.534
and jam it right back in the bottle, okay?

20:01.575 --> 20:04.453
She doesn't accept the money, it's over.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.914
Come on, Jack.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.290
Please tell me that you're not still pining

20:08.332 --> 20:09.876
for that married couple.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.670
I'm not still pining for that married couple.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.883
You said please.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.759
Okay, I can't believe I'm actually indulging this,

20:18.801 --> 20:21.595
but, um, what happened this morning,

20:21.637 --> 20:24.682
after your "transformative" threesome last night?

20:27.685 --> 20:28.895
I don't know.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.651
I was just thinking about how

20:35.693 --> 20:39.739
we only have sex, right?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.158
And that -- I don't know -- no matter how crazy it sounds,

20:42.200 --> 20:45.327
I just --

20:45.369 --> 20:46.913
I think we're bigger than that.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.789
For the record, that's like way up there

20:48.831 --> 20:51.751
on the crazy scale, like you-scare-me crazy, but...

20:51.792 --> 20:53.169
It's not crazy.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.754
I asked them to play hooky

20:54.795 --> 20:56.505
so we could day-drink and hang out at The Pearl.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.217
It's a fucking good day.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.261
All right. Just -- Just forget

21:02.302 --> 21:04.346
that they are a married couple for a second

21:04.388 --> 21:06.640
and think of them as the guy. -Okay.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.393
Okay. So you had sex with the guy,

21:09.435 --> 21:11.771
that you met like three days ago,

21:11.812 --> 21:14.398
but instead of playing it cool and skedaddling,

21:14.440 --> 21:16.025
you hang around his apartment

21:16.067 --> 21:17.443
<i>and</i> ask him to spend the day with you?
