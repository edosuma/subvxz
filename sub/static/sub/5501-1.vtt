02:01.485 --> 02:02.833
Let's go, let's go!

02:13.082 --> 02:14.300
Fuck off!

03:51.165 --> 03:53.371
Oh, man, what a result!

03:53.373 --> 03:56.062
- Oh!
- Another good one.

03:56.064 --> 03:58.946
All right, people?

03:58.948 --> 04:01.348
- All right, Jay?
- You all right? Oh, man.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.655
Dee's thrown the sickest piece
down on the tracks.

04:03.657 --> 04:05.416
- You want one, Dee?
- No, I'm good.

04:05.418 --> 04:09.260
- Mate, it was mental.
- Oh, fuck!

04:09.262 --> 04:10.734
Seriously,
though, dude,

04:10.736 --> 04:13.103
you need to make sure
you do not get nicked.

04:13.105 --> 04:14.546
That could mess up Graff Jam,

04:14.548 --> 04:16.211
everything you've been
working for.

04:16.213 --> 04:19.769
No, mate, it's worth it.
It's worth it for the art.

04:20.793 --> 04:21.880
Hey-hey.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.899
All right, let's have a look.

04:23.901 --> 04:25.725
Did you see his face
when you pulled that out?

04:25.727 --> 04:28.706
- He shit himself.
- Sort this out.

04:32.454 --> 04:35.046
Lovely.

04:35.048 --> 04:37.576
- Mate, anyone got the time?
- Accounted for and present.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.819
Got a lot there, boys.
Didn't miss a thing.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.932
- Yes!
- Nice one, bruv.

04:41.934 --> 04:43.758
I'm gonna get this off
to the usual place.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.553
See you lot tomorrow
to divvy up.

04:45.555 --> 04:47.475
- Sweet.
- All right.

04:47.477 --> 04:50.904
Burn the jumpsuits.

04:57.341 --> 05:00.094
I'm gonna head northwest.
I got shit to do.

05:00.096 --> 05:02.305
- Cool. Are you about later?
- Uh, text me, yeah?

05:02.307 --> 05:04.486
- I'm seeing my girl, so...
- All right, cool.

05:12.108 --> 05:13.837
Hey, hey!

05:21.782 --> 05:24.185
Look at your boy Dee, bro.
Look at his shoes.

05:27.996 --> 05:31.102
...and it was this wide,
just enough for me to...

05:31.104 --> 05:33.024
- All right, Mum.
- Hey, Dee!

05:33.026 --> 05:35.522
<i>Learn to cook clever
and stay slim forever.</i>

05:35.524 --> 05:36.966
Everything all right?

06:20.817 --> 06:22.996
- Mum, you all right?
- All right?

06:24.886 --> 06:27.029
Here you go, Mum.
Picked up a few packs.

06:27.031 --> 06:28.760
Thank you.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.650
- Dee, what's happening, bruv.
- Bruv, what's going on?

06:30.652 --> 06:32.413
It's good, man.

06:35.457 --> 06:38.658
Here you go, Mum.
A bit of housekeeping for ya.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.252
Marcus,
you keeping your nose clean?

06:41.254 --> 06:43.689
Course I am.

06:47.597 --> 06:49.837
Smile. Passionate woman.

06:49.839 --> 06:51.759
Nice.

06:51.761 --> 06:54.385
Towards me again. Smile.

06:54.387 --> 06:55.795
Stay. Fantastic.

06:55.797 --> 06:57.716
You're beautiful, Kirsten.
Beautiful.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.575
You know it. Excellent.

06:59.577 --> 07:01.114
Smile.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.133
Hey!

07:07.135 --> 07:09.793
You didn't tell me you were
gonna meet me here.

07:09.795 --> 07:11.107
You mentioned
where the shoot was.

07:11.109 --> 07:12.774
I thought I'd surprise ya.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.121
How was it, then?

07:18.123 --> 07:21.228
Um... it was good.
It was just basic.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.598
But I've been here since 8:00
in the morning, so...

07:23.600 --> 07:25.361
just a little tired.

07:25.363 --> 07:28.147
Oh, yeah, I was out at 4:00
this morning with Jason.

07:28.149 --> 07:29.621
All right, my dear...

07:29.623 --> 07:33.048
Which way?
Wanna bus it or Tube it?

07:33.050 --> 07:35.227
No need.
They sent a car for me.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.852
Come on, look. He's right there.

07:37.854 --> 07:39.775
Guess what?
You are probably gonna meet

07:39.777 --> 07:42.657
- my mum and brother next week.
- You invited them?

07:42.659 --> 07:43.650
I'm so excited.

07:43.652 --> 07:44.963
OK, tell me about them.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.462
All right, um...
My mum's quite chilled.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.608
She sits around getting stoned
most of the time.

07:49.610 --> 07:52.652
- OK.
- And then my brother...

07:52.654 --> 07:56.112
- He's very different than I am.
- And?

07:56.114 --> 07:57.872
Uh, all right.

07:57.874 --> 07:59.314
Um...

07:59.316 --> 08:01.236
My mum came over from Spain
when she was 18.

08:01.238 --> 08:04.728
She met Marcus's dad,
who was actually over there

08:04.730 --> 08:06.104
visiting his mates.

08:06.106 --> 08:07.834
Then she ended up moving
back to London with him.

08:07.836 --> 08:10.269
Me and Marcus have got
different dads, you see?

08:10.271 --> 08:12.159
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:12.161 --> 08:16.163
Marcus's dad was killed not long
after Marcus was born.

08:16.165 --> 08:18.565
He did a bank robbery
and the car he was in

08:18.567 --> 08:21.064
got run off the road
by the Old Bill.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.797
Oh, my God.

08:23.949 --> 08:25.389
What about your dad?

08:25.391 --> 08:27.602
I don't know much about him.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.744
Oh...

08:37.337 --> 08:39.547
Go on, son!

08:39.549 --> 08:42.365
Get in there!

08:42.366 --> 08:45.121
What's happening, boys?

08:45.123 --> 08:46.817
What a result, man.

08:46.819 --> 08:48.386
- Came in nice, yeah.
- Sweet.

08:48.388 --> 08:51.077
Fifty grand. Said a couple
of watches were a bit too rare.

08:51.079 --> 08:53.993
Here, Nick, get your bloke
to melt 'em down.

08:53.995 --> 08:56.590
- You got a buyer for the stones?
- Of course.

09:02.419 --> 09:04.659
I swear, this is the last time
I'm buying a round.

09:04.661 --> 09:07.382
- No change?
- Stop being tight, man.

09:07.384 --> 09:09.241
Ah, flippin' hell.

09:09.243 --> 09:11.962
- Could have given you the drink.
- Thanks.

09:11.964 --> 09:14.301
It's all a joke.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.672
- Hold on, you seen this?
- What's that?

09:16.674 --> 09:19.170
Wait, I know him, years ago
in Feltham, bruv.

09:19.172 --> 09:22.534
We was on the same wing.
From Canning Town, good geezer.

09:22.536 --> 09:23.975
Well, it says here...

09:23.977 --> 09:25.928
"Armed police ambushed
a smash-and-grab gang

09:25.930 --> 09:28.076
last night as they battered
through the windows

09:28.078 --> 09:30.125
of a jeweller's in Northfield
shopping centre, East London.

09:30.127 --> 09:33.072
Scotland Yard said this was
a proactive operation

09:33.074 --> 09:35.443
by the Flying Squad into
an organized criminal network

09:35.445 --> 09:37.395
involving
smash-and-grab robbers.

09:37.397 --> 09:39.253
The Flying Squad,
nicknamed the Sweeney...

09:39.255 --> 09:41.656
Fuckin' Sweeney.

09:41.658 --> 09:43.867
...have been deployed to target
smash-and-grab raiders

09:43.869 --> 09:45.565
after a series
of long-running attacks

09:45.567 --> 09:47.486
on luxury stores
across London."

09:47.488 --> 09:48.864
What else it say?

09:48.866 --> 09:50.789
"...in custody
of magistrates next week."

09:52.709 --> 09:55.078
That's them Canning Town boys
I saw on the news this morning.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.096
They got proper fucked
by someone.

09:57.098 --> 09:59.370
Hey, look, it says
the Old Bill had intelligence.

09:59.372 --> 10:01.355
They've been grassed, mate.
There ain't no other way.

10:01.357 --> 10:04.175
On the other hand, maybe they
just got a bit sloppy.

10:04.177 --> 10:06.098
I'm always saying
we've gotta keep a low profile.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.147
Hello, Mum, you in?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.742
Yeah, I'm here.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.439
- Hello. You all right?
- Hi.

10:12.441 --> 10:15.321
Yeah, I'm starving again.
Have you eaten, baby?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.567
No, I'm all right,
I ate earlier.

10:23.972 --> 10:25.765
Listen, Mum...

10:25.767 --> 10:28.392
I think I'm gonna move out
for a little bit,

10:28.394 --> 10:30.057
maybe for good.

10:30.059 --> 10:31.723
That's great, baby.
Where are you moving into?

10:31.725 --> 10:34.733
- What's the plan?
- I'm moving in with the Delhams.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.303
- Kirsten?
- Yeah.

10:36.305 --> 10:38.353
She's got a place
over in the East End,

10:38.355 --> 10:40.307
and I thought it would be good
for a while.

10:40.309 --> 10:43.637
Tell me everything about her.
I want to know everything.

10:43.639 --> 10:45.305
We need to find Dominic
a bird.

10:45.307 --> 10:47.962
I don't need a girl, man.
Too much effort.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.437
I'm happy being free and single.

10:51.327 --> 10:53.120
Hey, I never got the elbow.
I just don't wanna...

10:58.023 --> 10:59.495
Shh!

11:24.481 --> 11:26.018
Them pricks over there...

11:26.020 --> 11:28.580
I swear that's them pussies.

11:28.582 --> 11:30.565
Do they wanna say
something?

11:30.567 --> 11:32.454
Fucking West Grove boys.

11:32.456 --> 11:36.333
Leon and that flash cunt Junior
need to fuck right off.

11:40.785 --> 11:44.628
- They think they're too heavy.
- Proper idiots.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.933
Fuckin' pussies!

11:46.935 --> 11:49.369
Should put both of 'em
in the fucking ground.

11:49.371 --> 11:51.354
They got all the dealers
in this manor now.

11:51.356 --> 11:53.404
Span the whole area now,
top to bottom.

11:53.406 --> 11:56.096
Last few months, every single
shot's been buying from them.

12:11.537 --> 12:12.978
- What?
- What?

12:15.285 --> 12:17.459
Fuckin' hell, mate.
That's well good.

12:17.461 --> 12:20.088
- Cheers.
- Here, got that for you.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.753
Oh, nice one.

12:21.755 --> 12:24.956
So, how's it all going,
this art thing you're doing?

12:24.958 --> 12:27.777
Yeah. It's all right.

12:33.734 --> 12:35.526
I'm really proud of you,
you know.

12:35.528 --> 12:36.679
I mean that.

12:36.681 --> 12:37.835
I know, bruv.

12:39.372 --> 12:41.740
So, what are you working on?

12:41.742 --> 12:43.758
Same old, really.
Doin' my thing with the boys.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.314
- You should slow down a bit.
- No, mate, never.

12:47.316 --> 12:48.886
I got big plans.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.753
I see you're full on
with smashing the system, then.

12:53.755 --> 12:55.065
Against this and that.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.667
Yeah, pretty much
what you're doing.

12:56.669 --> 12:59.134
Confronting authority,
challenging society.

12:59.136 --> 13:02.402
Fuck the authorities, but I
don't want society brought down.

13:02.404 --> 13:04.966
Otherwise there'd be nothing
for me to go and blag.

13:17.778 --> 13:19.702
Surprise!

13:22.680 --> 13:24.695
- Hey!
- What are you doin' here?

13:24.697 --> 13:27.417
What do you think
I'm doing here? Hey!

13:31.680 --> 13:33.601
S!

13:33.603 --> 13:37.220
- Whaddya say, Dee?
- What's going on, Shaun?

13:37.222 --> 13:39.558
What's that you're wearing?
Is that aftershave?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.128
No, mate, deodorant.

13:41.130 --> 13:43.017
Fuckin' hell, bruv,
you're caked in it.

13:43.019 --> 13:45.263
- All right, later, yeah.
- Yeah, laters.

13:51.092 --> 13:54.581
- All right, boys. Yo, Kerry.
- What's happening, brother?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.695
- Hey.
- Long time, Dee.

13:56.697 --> 13:58.489
Never see you around these days.

13:58.491 --> 14:00.989
I keep my head down.
Workin' on my shit.

14:00.991 --> 14:03.262
All over east, I here
That's good to hear, man.

14:03.264 --> 14:05.984
Brother's over there, man.

14:05.986 --> 14:07.330
All right, sweet. Laters, yeah?

14:07.332 --> 14:08.804
- Yeah.
- Behave, yourself, yeah?

14:10.310 --> 14:12.903
He used
to fancy you back in school.

14:12.905 --> 14:15.146
- You all right?
- You all right, Dee?

14:15.148 --> 14:17.836
- Can't say hello to me anymore?
- Sorry, Tara, you all right?

14:17.838 --> 14:19.470
- You all right?
- Goin' good, yeah?

14:19.472 --> 14:21.905
It's fuckin' cold,
I gotta get in.

14:21.907 --> 14:25.428
I'd love to stay with you lot,
but I can't, seriously.

14:25.430 --> 14:28.218
- Where are you off to?
- I'm gonna see my girl.

14:31.099 --> 14:34.013
- Here, put that in your pocket.
- Bruv, I'm cool!

14:34.015 --> 14:36.896
Shut up, can't have you runnin'
out of dough, take it.

14:36.898 --> 14:38.817
I got a few quid
on me already.

14:38.819 --> 14:41.476
Especially takin' out a bird.
Enjoy your night.

14:41.478 --> 14:44.006
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- I know you do.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.801
Talk later.

14:59.353 --> 15:03.069
- Kirsten, can we get a photo?
- Oh, my God, of course, yeah!

15:06.014 --> 15:10.147
Kevin, my boyfriend, Dee. Come!
Just one second.

15:22.063 --> 15:23.375
Hi!

15:23.377 --> 15:24.946
Thank you!

15:30.518 --> 15:31.801
That is secret love.

15:54.638 --> 15:56.975
I've gotta go.
My car is downstairs.

15:56.977 --> 15:58.898
- OK, have a good one.
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.884
I've gotta get up, too.
I'm working this morning.

16:00.886 --> 16:03.703
- What time you back?
- Probably late, I'll text you.

16:03.705 --> 16:06.458
I'll fetch my stuff over
this evening, all right?

16:06.460 --> 16:07.518
Great!

16:08.797 --> 16:10.784
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:05.142 --> 17:07.064
All right?

17:11.836 --> 17:13.788
You're so beautiful.
You know that?

17:13.790 --> 17:15.422
Yeah, I know.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.394
Got much happening this week?

17:19.396 --> 17:21.828
Yeah, got a few things
to check out on Oxford Street.

17:21.829 --> 17:24.358
And I still gotta get
them outfits.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.210
Anyway, I'm gonna stay at my
gaff for the rest of the week.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.125
Don't want to be seen
in and out of here too much.

17:30.127 --> 17:33.105
Yeah, of course. Shout me later
if you want me to come over.

17:33.107 --> 17:35.923

- That graffiti thing?

18:18.976 --> 18:21.600
- Yeah, the weekend. Sweet.
- See you later.

18:21.602 --> 18:24.867

to the wedding, yeah?

18:24.869 --> 18:26.758
- Bye, baby.
- Bye-bye.

19:06.127 --> 19:08.787

19:55.231 --> 19:56.832
Do ya?

19:56.834 --> 19:58.914
Yeah.

19:58.916 --> 20:01.828
That's it, you're with
them West Grove boys, ain't ya?

20:01.830 --> 20:04.520
I know them,
but I ain't "with them."

20:04.522 --> 20:05.703
OK.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.625
Look, what is your name?

20:07.627 --> 20:09.485
Michelle.

20:09.487 --> 20:11.407
Ah, yeah.

20:11.409 --> 20:13.264
That's the one.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.057
Michelle, yeah.

20:15.059 --> 20:16.115
I thought so.

20:16.117 --> 20:17.656
Right.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.487
So what is up
with those West Grove fools?

20:36.489 --> 20:38.314
They're from my area, innit?

20:38.316 --> 20:41.196
That's all.
Ain't nothin' to do with me.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.759
They're grassers,
they talked to Trident, innit?

20:43.761 --> 20:46.001
One of my cousins is doing time
'cause of them.

20:46.003 --> 20:49.107
Well, the only good police grass
is a dead police grass.

20:49.109 --> 20:51.093
Exactly. They're fuckin' fools.

20:51.095 --> 20:53.272
You used to go with that Leon,
too, right?

20:53.274 --> 20:55.226
Yeah, a time ago.

20:55.228 --> 20:57.628
He's just a boy in a man's body.

20:57.630 --> 20:59.359
Trust me.

21:13.871 --> 21:15.758

21:15.760 --> 21:16.719

25:00.914 --> 25:03.154
No, but I will call you
after my dinner.

25:03.156 --> 25:05.749
- Have a good time, yeah?
- Goodbye.

25:05.751 --> 25:06.997
Mm!

25:06.999 --> 25:09.304
Where are you going? Come here.

25:09.306 --> 25:11.867
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

25:11.869 --> 25:15.649
Yeah, he's here at mine.
I'll just get him.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.946
Yeah, I'm all right.
Here he is.

25:18.948 --> 25:20.996

26:26.183 --> 26:28.967
Bike's untraceable, anyway.

26:28.969 --> 26:31.081

26:31.083 --> 26:32.907
Let the Old Bill run out
of steam.

26:32.909 --> 26:34.637
- They don't know us.
- Listen.

26:34.639 --> 26:36.530
We're sitting on a nice
sum of dough...

26:38.483 --> 26:40.307
What's up? We're off, yeah?

26:40.309 --> 26:43.285
- What did mum want?
- Nothing, just to talk to me.

26:43.287 --> 26:44.983
Where are you off to?

26:44.985 --> 26:46.873
Just gonna go get Lena

on this doorstep, understand?

26:48.958 --> 26:50.657
Course I won't.

26:51.969 --> 26:56.038
"Lena with my lot."

26:57.990 --> 27:00.038
So, what's Kirsten
up to tonight?

27:00.040 --> 27:01.833
Some dinner with her agency.

27:01.835 --> 27:04.299
Did they forget our invites,
yeah?

27:06.447 --> 27:08.495
Oh, wicked, this is it?

27:08.497 --> 27:11.026
- This'll do.
- Want some help, mate?

27:11.028 --> 27:15.033
No, I'm all right.
Be sure to put that back.

27:16.665 --> 27:19.196
- Oh, man.
- Yo, just here is fine.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.903
Thanks, man.

27:23.905 --> 27:26.370
I love it.

27:26.372 --> 27:27.875
Oh, man.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.667
It's proper heavy reach
as well.

27:29.669 --> 27:32.424
You can see it from three
different points down there.

27:32.426 --> 27:34.924
Oh!

27:36.461 --> 27:38.477
- Oh, man!
- Come on.

27:38.479 --> 27:41.296
I saw it when I was doing
a bike drop down there.

27:41.298 --> 27:43.762
I looked up and I was like,
"Fuck, yeah!"

27:43.764 --> 27:44.980
That's gonna look sick.

27:44.982 --> 27:46.037
- Jason.
- Yeah.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.439
Give us a hand, mate.

27:48.441 --> 27:50.490
This way, mate.

27:50.492 --> 27:54.333
We're likely to get 50 grand
apiece for the job today. Right?

27:54.335 --> 27:56.159
My thing is this.

27:56.161 --> 27:58.977
We put the lot in with our
whacks from the shopping mall.

27:58.979 --> 28:01.283
That's about 220 grand
altogether,

28:01.285 --> 28:03.143
guessing what everyone's
already spent.

28:03.145 --> 28:05.768
Yeah, about 220,
and we invest all of it

28:05.770 --> 28:07.017
in a load of sniff.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.580
That sounds proper.
I'm involved.

28:09.582 --> 28:12.847
Moving away from robbery, we can
triple that 220 in a few weeks,

28:12.849 --> 28:15.314
just by squeezing out
those West Grove dealers alone.

28:15.316 --> 28:17.941
- Exactly.
- Who do you wanna buy from?

28:17.943 --> 28:21.111
- Chris Regan.
- Wanna deal with the Regans?

28:21.113 --> 28:22.457
Yeah, of course.

28:22.459 --> 28:24.411
Chris runs his own thing.

28:24.413 --> 28:27.198
His uncles and my old man did
blags together in the '80s.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.017
So I know Chris,
and I'm tight with him.

28:30.019 --> 28:31.907
Sweet. Branch out.

28:31.909 --> 28:33.604
All right, let's do it.

28:33.606 --> 28:36.744
Sit back and earn some
easy dough for a while, yeah?

28:38.475 --> 28:42.637
Oh, man, you see
you go down Bethnal Green

28:42.639 --> 28:44.592
till you see our artwork.

28:44.594 --> 28:47.250
It's the best.
You'll find the best locations.

28:47.252 --> 28:48.979
The highest points.

28:48.981 --> 28:52.407
There's stuff you won't even
know till you get to.

28:52.409 --> 28:54.201
Yeah, all right, nice!

28:54.203 --> 28:57.885
Oi! Where's your stencil?
I'll cut you another one.

28:57.887 --> 28:59.678
Shut up, it's all right.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.959
Aw, princess!

29:00.961 --> 29:03.523
Piss off, there.

29:03.525 --> 29:05.475
- You finished, then?
- Yeah, all done.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.463
Listen, mate,
give me your number

29:07.465 --> 29:10.058
and I'll call you if there's
any Old Bill

29:10.060 --> 29:11.499
with security downstairs.

29:11.501 --> 29:13.933
- Ready to leave, yeah?
- Yeah, ready to roll.

29:13.935 --> 29:15.153
Sweet.

29:18.996 --> 29:21.011
Dee, come in! Come in.

29:21.013 --> 29:23.161
How are you doing?

29:24.922 --> 29:26.648
- How are you, good?
- I'm good, I'm fine.

29:26.650 --> 29:29.277
I've just got to pop downstairs
to get a bottle of wine.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.583
Philip's just finishing up.
Go and make yourself at home.

29:31.585 --> 29:33.761
- I'll be two minutes.
- Sweet.

29:33.763 --> 29:35.457
See you in a minute.

30:02.207 --> 30:05.793
Just keep your head up a little.

30:30.107 --> 30:32.187
Ah, great to meet you again,
Dee.

30:32.189 --> 30:34.397
- Thanks for coming by.
- Yeah, you too, Philip.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.831
- Thanks for inviting me over.
- Take your coat off.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.689
- Have a seat.
- Yeah, cheers.

30:38.691 --> 30:42.020
I saw a great piece of street
art today off Hackney Road.

30:42.022 --> 30:44.712
It had a line of riot police,
and next to them was

30:44.714 --> 30:47.819
a life-size street cleaner
with a jet hose

30:47.821 --> 30:49.291
washing them off the wall.

30:49.293 --> 30:51.663
Caption read,
"Just a thin blue line."

30:51.665 --> 30:54.513
- Yeah, it's one of mine.
- Thought it might have been.

30:54.515 --> 30:56.851
I really loved
how it was done layered,

30:56.853 --> 30:58.709
both visually
and in the wordplay.

30:58.711 --> 31:00.951
Yeah, well I like
working that way.

31:00.953 --> 31:03.706
Um, lots of layers, you know.
That's how I see life.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.724
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

31:05.726 --> 31:07.583
I didn't know
that was still there.

31:07.585 --> 31:11.653
Too right it's still there.
Let me get some wine glasses.

31:13.063 --> 31:16.070
So, Dee,
we were chatting earlier,

31:16.072 --> 31:18.956
and Philip was asking me
how you started out.

31:20.814 --> 31:24.079
Well, uh, basically,
when I was a kid,

31:24.081 --> 31:26.961
I used to run around
with my brother and our mates.

31:26.963 --> 31:29.075
We were what you might call
a little gang.

31:29.077 --> 31:31.894
And I used to go around the area
and tag our name,

31:31.896 --> 31:33.655
which was obviously really
important to all of us.

31:33.657 --> 31:35.706
And then if we went into
another neighbourhood,

31:35.708 --> 31:37.373
that was a must-do thing,
really.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.678
But then I was really into
the art side of it,

31:39.680 --> 31:43.874
so I started doing other stuff
which wasn't just tagging.

31:43.876 --> 31:45.896
- Then it kicked off from there.
- Yeah.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.735
Oh, Rita.
Thank you for coming.

31:49.737 --> 31:51.146
See you tomorrow, bye.

31:51.148 --> 31:52.715
It's amazing, isn't it?

31:52.717 --> 31:55.758
What started out in New York
in the 1970s

31:55.760 --> 31:58.865
as a criminal offense is now
becoming a national art form.

31:58.867 --> 32:02.646
Even when you started out,
it was seen as vandalism.

32:02.648 --> 32:05.143
It's still seen like that
by a lot of people.

32:05.145 --> 32:07.994
Sure it is, but look,
we have graffiti art

32:07.996 --> 32:10.750
fetching six figure sums
in some galleries.

32:10.752 --> 32:12.672
In London as well as Berlin.

32:12.674 --> 32:14.306
What did he say?

32:14.308 --> 32:17.059
He does his banking
every Thursday.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.429
Laundering his weed money
using his chauffeur's cover,

32:19.431 --> 32:21.032
so he has to keep
the same routine.

32:21.034 --> 32:24.811
He keeps it in the back office,
in one safe, no hiding places?

32:24.813 --> 32:28.177
Yeah, all in the safe
with the shop's takings.

32:30.451 --> 32:31.509
Sounds about right.

32:33.975 --> 32:36.343
Nice one, Michelle.
See you later, yeah?

32:36.345 --> 32:37.819
Laters, yeah.

32:39.869 --> 32:42.047
- Be careful, all right?
- Of course.

32:52.521 --> 32:55.497
- What are youse lot reckoning?
- To be honest, I ain't keen.

32:55.499 --> 32:57.323
I'm still surprised
that you're mixing up

32:57.325 --> 32:59.373
with a bird
from over the West Grove.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.257
I told you, she's got nothing to
do with those West Grove pricks.

33:02.259 --> 33:05.267
This blag that she's putting up
is right on her doorstep.

33:05.269 --> 33:07.062
It's in her manor. She's sweet.

33:07.064 --> 33:10.616
And she knows nothing about us,
just that we're grafters.

33:10.618 --> 33:13.787
Now, fair play: it's good that
she lined up the job and that,

33:13.789 --> 33:16.095
but I thought we was knockin'
risks like this on the head.

33:16.097 --> 33:19.650
We don't need to be doing this
with everything coming up soon.

33:19.652 --> 33:22.182
A blag like this
is street level.

33:22.184 --> 33:25.160
- What's the point?
- Fuck it, it's sitting there.

33:25.162 --> 33:27.210
Who's the geezer gonna
complain to, anyway?

33:27.212 --> 33:30.157
The way I see it,
it's just a nice little touch.

33:30.159 --> 33:32.879
So, what do you reckon?

33:32.881 --> 33:34.897
Tell me, how do you make
your living?

33:34.899 --> 33:36.819
Have you sold any work?

33:36.821 --> 33:40.246
- No. Well, I mean, I don't...
- So, how do you get by?

33:40.248 --> 33:42.392
Well, I do motorbike couriering
when I can.

33:42.394 --> 33:44.507
And my brother
helps me out, too.

33:44.509 --> 33:46.528
He's a good boy like that.

33:50.435 --> 33:53.156
- This your man here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's him. Karim.

33:53.158 --> 33:55.526
He's got a fucking bird
with him.

33:55.528 --> 33:57.832
Looks like a prost, doesn't it?

33:57.834 --> 34:01.355
Fuck sake.

34:01.357 --> 34:02.926
So should we split or what?

34:22.916 --> 34:24.550
21,000.

34:25.831 --> 34:29.641
40, 60, 80... 22 grand.

34:29.643 --> 34:32.045
Fucking hell.
Skunk makes my life easy.

34:39.219 --> 34:41.331
Put on some music, huh?

34:41.333 --> 34:44.085
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

34:44.088 --> 34:45.848
Good choice.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.347
- Yeah!
- You feelin' frisky?

34:48.349 --> 34:50.652
Ask your friend, huh?

34:50.655 --> 34:52.639
If you would want...

34:52.641 --> 34:53.664
Yeah.

34:57.253 --> 35:00.967
I've got a lot of work, darling.
Still got a lot of work to do.

35:00.969 --> 35:02.764
OK, why not? Why not?

35:09.970 --> 35:11.925
Yeah, get it right in there.

35:17.306 --> 35:18.777
Fuckin' hell!

35:18.779 --> 35:20.124
Stay there.

35:26.852 --> 35:28.163
Stay down
or I'll blow your head off!

35:28.165 --> 35:30.759
Think
you're bad men, yeah?

35:33.001 --> 35:35.756
- I'll find you, believe me!
- Shut up, man!

35:37.549 --> 35:39.438
Get down!

35:39.440 --> 35:42.610
I'm gonna find out
where you all's fucking live!

35:42.612 --> 35:44.214
Oh, please.

35:47.415 --> 35:49.400
You don't know who I am!

35:55.777 --> 35:58.116
Now, be a good boy
and shut up, eh?!

36:03.592 --> 36:06.313
I suppose a blow job for me's
out of the question, yeah?

36:06.315 --> 36:08.747
Fuck you!

36:08.749 --> 36:11.951
Where are you from?
What country?

36:11.953 --> 36:14.193
Where the hell are you from?

36:14.195 --> 36:15.954
Good, let's go.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.862
You, up, up!

36:19.864 --> 36:21.944
Down! Face down!

36:21.946 --> 36:23.161
Stay!

36:23.163 --> 36:25.147
Get down there!

36:25.149 --> 36:27.517
Fucking hell. Shut up.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.343
You slut.
I'll slap your arse as well.

36:29.345 --> 36:32.836
Don't do that, please!

36:32.838 --> 36:35.270
Aside from
this mainstream collision,

36:35.272 --> 36:38.313
do you think that street art
still has a rebellious edge?

36:38.315 --> 36:39.978
Oh, definitely, yeah.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.958
You know, I strongly maintain
that graffiti...

36:42.960 --> 36:45.039
satirical street art
like yours...

36:45.041 --> 36:46.577
is majorly important.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.210
It's important because
it allows people,

36:48.212 --> 36:52.567
it sometimes forces people,
to see life in different terms.

36:52.569 --> 36:56.443
Even if it just makes people
open up their eyes

36:56.445 --> 36:59.998
for a few moments,
it's worth its weight in gold.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.320
- How's that one, good?
- Yeah, I got it.

37:09.322 --> 37:11.786
Perfect. I'll come here
in 5 or 10 minutes?

37:11.788 --> 37:12.875
OK, cool.

37:12.877 --> 37:13.901
Hey!

37:13.903 --> 37:16.591
Hey, what's up?

37:16.593 --> 37:18.641
You know, I was meeting
those art people today?

37:18.643 --> 37:20.339
Yeah, the German guy

37:20.341 --> 37:22.580
and that really cool chick
from the Graffiti Jam.

37:22.582 --> 37:25.239
Yeah? He's one of the guys
that runs

37:25.241 --> 37:26.650
the Berlin
Contemporary Art Show.

37:26.652 --> 37:28.955
He's laid it on the table:
he likes what I do

37:28.957 --> 37:31.357
and wants me to be the British
representative for the show.

37:31.359 --> 37:33.984
Would you move there with me?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.681
Dee.

37:35.683 --> 37:37.220
Come on, you always say you
can work from wherever.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.590
Half the jobs
you do abroad anyway.

37:39.592 --> 37:41.259
Of course! Yes!

37:49.137 --> 37:51.121
Been in this place before?

37:51.123 --> 37:52.341
No, Jason.

37:56.088 --> 37:59.097
Hold the queue till you get
more spenders, right?

37:59.099 --> 38:00.987
Dee!

38:00.989 --> 38:02.845
What's up, brother?

38:02.847 --> 38:06.017
Getting something from the car.
Everyone else is inside, man.

38:19.312 --> 38:21.264
Hey, Nicky!

38:21.266 --> 38:23.923
She's with me, yeah?

38:57.943 --> 38:59.158
Dee.

39:03.292 --> 39:07.134
Hi! Good to see you!

39:07.136 --> 39:10.977
Hi. Kirsten. Nice to meet you.

39:10.979 --> 39:12.899
Can I have a bottle, yeah?

39:12.901 --> 39:14.725
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.071
All right, Dee?

39:19.692 --> 39:22.509
Michelle, Michelle!

39:22.511 --> 39:24.622
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:24.624 --> 39:26.577
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey!

39:26.579 --> 39:29.203
- Here you are.
- Thanks, yeah.

39:29.205 --> 39:32.471
- Nicky, where's Kerry tonight?
- She's working tonight, man.

39:32.473 --> 39:35.770
- Where does she work?
- She's a table dancer. Stripper.

39:35.772 --> 39:37.503
Nice!

39:42.564 --> 39:44.934
That's all right, I'll do it.
Don't worry about it.

39:54.447 --> 39:56.466
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

39:58.035 --> 40:00.980
Listen to me,
I just wanna say well done.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.862
Guy in Berlin's gonna be
impressed.

40:03.864 --> 40:05.050
Well done, mate.

40:07.612 --> 40:10.396
- You all right? Having fun.
- Mm! Yeah!

40:10.398 --> 40:12.481
It's like being
in a music video.

40:30.899 --> 40:33.043
There's a few grand
to stick in your pocket.

40:33.045 --> 40:36.311
Knock that courier job
on the head and focus on Berlin.

40:36.313 --> 40:38.233
- You sure?
- We had a nice touch yesterday.

40:38.235 --> 40:40.413
And I got something big
coming up.

40:43.167 --> 40:44.353
Sweet.

41:06.327 --> 41:07.671
What's good, baby?

41:07.673 --> 41:09.496
Junior, my friend.
What can I get you?

41:09.498 --> 41:11.677
Let me get a table
over there, please.

41:13.117 --> 41:15.167
See what I'm saying? Come on.

41:17.731 --> 41:19.650
Well, look who's there.

41:19.652 --> 41:20.994
Leon's old side chick, you know.

41:20.996 --> 41:23.718
Fucking with
that fuckwad, look at her.

41:25.291 --> 41:26.568
Look who's just
dropped in.

41:30.191 --> 41:31.503
What's the matter?

41:31.505 --> 41:34.930
Let you look
at my dick.

41:34.932 --> 41:37.171
- Second-hand slag.
- What's up?

41:37.173 --> 41:39.929
Has he got
a fucking problem?

41:42.843 --> 41:46.496
- He's a fucking psycho.
- All right.

41:53.542 --> 41:55.589
- What are you saying?
- What do you mean?

41:55.591 --> 41:58.057
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

41:58.059 --> 41:59.821
Yeah, you heard.

42:04.818 --> 42:06.993
- I'm saying you're a pussy.
- Really?

42:06.995 --> 42:08.979
Yeah, you feelin' it, yeah?

42:08.981 --> 42:11.926
- Fuck you!
- Get off of me!

42:23.973 --> 42:26.216
Calm down! Calm down!

42:28.104 --> 42:30.569
I know you, you know.
I know you!

42:30.571 --> 42:33.772
Slag, you can suck my cock!
Don't ever forget that!

42:33.774 --> 42:35.758
Fuck off!

42:35.760 --> 42:38.544
- You fuck!
- I'll shoot you in the head!

42:38.546 --> 42:41.300
- You prick! You dickhead!
- Fuck you!

42:44.568 --> 42:47.386
You're fucking dead!
You're a pussy!

42:47.388 --> 42:49.148
What you wanna do?

42:49.150 --> 42:52.321
I ain't worried,
'cause you're a faggot!

42:57.093 --> 42:58.567
Fuck.

43:11.988 --> 43:14.870
I hate violence, you know?

43:14.872 --> 43:17.624
I'm from a sleepy little
beach town outside of L.A.

43:17.626 --> 43:18.744
and I am...

43:18.746 --> 43:20.635
I'm just not used to that.

43:20.637 --> 43:23.328
Yeah. I don't like violence
either, it's bullshit.

43:24.706 --> 43:27.010
Yeah, it scares me, too.

43:27.012 --> 43:28.450
Yeah.

43:28.452 --> 43:30.470
Well, I'm glad
you don't hang out

43:30.472 --> 43:33.095
with your brother
and those dudes, you know?

43:33.097 --> 43:34.921
Don't want them pulling
you down.

43:34.923 --> 43:37.452
Kirsten, they do not
pull me down.

43:37.454 --> 43:39.727
I don't mean it like that.
I like your brother.

43:39.729 --> 43:41.680
I like his friends,
they're cool, but...

43:41.682 --> 43:44.179
Look, you've got to put it
in perspective, all right?

43:44.181 --> 43:47.833
See, the men they attacked,
they are nasty people.

43:49.690 --> 43:51.033
When we were younger,

43:51.035 --> 43:54.205
they put 45 stitches
in Dominic's back.

43:54.207 --> 43:55.807
- You know why?
- No.

43:55.809 --> 43:59.234
'Cause he visited his gran
who lived in the same postcode.

43:59.236 --> 44:03.462
It's bullshit.
All of it is wrong.

44:03.464 --> 44:05.900
But that's how it is
and I hate it.

44:08.108 --> 44:09.901
I know you've had
to climb a mountain

44:09.903 --> 44:13.456
to get away from this crap
and see life for what it can be.

44:13.458 --> 44:16.466
You inspire me.

44:16.468 --> 44:17.748
I appreciate that.

44:17.750 --> 44:20.153
You're doing something
with your life.

44:21.305 --> 44:23.193
And I just...

44:23.195 --> 44:26.848
I want you to know
that I'm by your side.

45:59.517 --> 46:02.047
- OK?
- Yeah, no problem.

46:12.618 --> 46:14.217
How you been keeping, well?

46:14.219 --> 46:17.099
Everything's going really good
right now, Chris.

46:17.101 --> 46:19.310
- That's what I like to hear.
- Cheers, mate.

46:19.312 --> 46:20.367
Right.

46:20.369 --> 46:22.866
I got 300k's worth for you here.

46:22.868 --> 46:25.748
300? Chris, I said 220.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.638
Yeah, I know,
but if you want 220,

46:27.640 --> 46:29.913
it means I've got to cut
a box in half.

46:29.915 --> 46:31.962
Who am I gonna sell
half a key to?

46:31.964 --> 46:33.916
300's a nice round number.

46:33.918 --> 46:36.702
Now you can take the six
or stay with the five.

46:36.704 --> 46:38.977
- I'm happy either way.
- Let's take the six.

46:38.979 --> 46:41.796
Good man.

46:41.798 --> 46:44.007
You owe us 80 on the reloads,
yeah?

46:44.009 --> 46:45.447
All right, done.

46:45.449 --> 46:47.466
How's your mum?

46:47.468 --> 46:49.132
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

46:49.134 --> 46:51.054
Give her my regards
when you see her.

46:51.056 --> 46:52.623
You seeing that little
blond bird?

46:52.625 --> 46:54.897
Yeah, I am, actually.

46:54.899 --> 46:56.468
It's been there a while.

46:56.470 --> 46:57.939
Yeah, it's been years.

46:57.941 --> 46:59.927
Get married, will ya?
Have some kids.

46:59.929 --> 47:01.687
Give your mum grandchildren.
She'd love that.

47:01.689 --> 47:03.548
No, not yet.

47:15.207 --> 47:16.583
Nick and Kwame here?

47:16.585 --> 47:18.473
Nah, they chipped off
when we got back.

47:18.475 --> 47:21.359
Said they'd be here about now,
actually.

47:25.009 --> 47:28.146
All went well.
It's safely tucked away.

47:35.836 --> 47:38.268
What's up?

47:38.270 --> 47:40.574
- Went all right, yeah?
- Yeah, sweet.

47:40.576 --> 47:43.137
- And he credited us 80 grand.
- Eighty grand?

47:43.139 --> 47:45.091
Yeah. So that's 300 altogether?

47:45.093 --> 47:47.078
Yeah, 300,
a nice round number.

47:47.080 --> 47:49.928
- Where is it?
- At the house, nice and safe.

47:49.930 --> 47:52.586
All right, but we've got to keep
our heads down a few days.

47:52.588 --> 47:54.925
- Then we start looking out.
- Yeah, exactly.

47:54.927 --> 47:57.360
Yeah, that is definitely
a good shot.

47:57.362 --> 47:58.833
Best idea you've had
all year, man.

48:06.074 --> 48:08.924
- Look at these.
- Having fun?

48:10.334 --> 48:11.871
- Hey, Dee!
- Hello.

48:11.873 --> 48:13.984
How are you doing?
Great to see you again.

48:13.986 --> 48:16.195
Yeah, you, too. Hello, babe.

48:16.197 --> 48:18.085
- You all right?
- Good, how are you?

48:18.087 --> 48:20.426
Hold on for a second.

48:28.336 --> 48:30.256
When did the council do this?

48:30.258 --> 48:33.075
Fuck knows. Must have been
the last few days, I reckon.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.221
You don't seem happy about it.

48:35.223 --> 48:38.264
No, no, I am, but it feels like
a sell-out, know what I mean?

48:38.266 --> 48:41.692
No. Absolutely not.
This is an accreditation.

48:41.694 --> 48:43.805
You said this piece
is multi-layered, right?

48:43.807 --> 48:46.880
What, the Perspex adds
another layer, yeah?

48:46.882 --> 48:49.861
Yes, it does, it actually...
works perfectly.

48:49.863 --> 48:51.590
Hey.

48:51.592 --> 48:53.575
- That's very cool.
- Isn't it?

48:53.577 --> 48:55.467
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

49:00.944 --> 49:02.288
Shaun, go get the door.

49:02.290 --> 49:04.726
No, man, I'm right in the middle
of this...

49:16.801 --> 49:18.595
Uggh!

49:21.959 --> 49:24.198
Get down! Down!

49:24.200 --> 49:25.416
Fuckin' pussy!

49:25.418 --> 49:28.780
Ugh! Get the fuck off me!

49:28.782 --> 49:29.740
Ohhh!

49:35.028 --> 49:36.470
Quiet down.

49:38.903 --> 49:41.624
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck off!

49:41.626 --> 49:44.380
Make that fucking slut
be quiet as well.

49:45.886 --> 49:48.190
You're being a fucking cuntful,
shut up!

49:52.293 --> 49:53.928
Aaaah!

50:11.448 --> 50:13.304
Ohhh!

50:17.150 --> 50:19.934
- Where the fuck is the food?
- Fuck!

50:19.936 --> 50:21.119
Are you stupid?

50:21.121 --> 50:22.913
Are you fucking stupid?

50:22.915 --> 50:24.835
The only fucking reason
I ain't killed you right now

50:24.837 --> 50:27.205
is 'cause my man wants answers,
you fuckin' prick!

50:28.713 --> 50:30.248
Shut the fuck up!

50:30.250 --> 50:33.484
Leon can't do his own work!
You pussy!

50:33.486 --> 50:35.886
- Where's the food?!
- I don't fucking know!

50:35.888 --> 50:37.231
Where's the food?

50:37.233 --> 50:41.172
There's 300 grand worth
of sniff in this flat.

50:44.729 --> 50:46.904
You're not gonna say where
the food is, yeah?

50:46.906 --> 50:47.866
No problem.

50:47.868 --> 50:50.268
Burn him.

50:50.270 --> 50:53.151
That's good.

50:53.153 --> 50:55.202
Watch. He's gonna burn
to the bone.

50:58.534 --> 51:01.000
Shut up! Shut up!

51:01.002 --> 51:03.018
Just tell us where
the fucking drugs are

51:03.020 --> 51:04.715
and we'll leave.

51:04.717 --> 51:08.847
I don't know what you're fucking
talking about, you dick!

51:08.849 --> 51:10.928
You're gonna get topped,
the lot of you!

51:10.930 --> 51:15.541
By you, huh? Kwame?

51:15.543 --> 51:19.673
And Marcus, what the fuck are
those pussy holes gonna do?

51:19.675 --> 51:21.724
You tell me where's
their fucking food

51:21.726 --> 51:23.614
and we'll go.

51:23.616 --> 51:26.785
If not, I'm gonna drop
both your knickers

51:26.787 --> 51:28.675
and fuck the pair of ya.

51:28.677 --> 51:31.303
We're gonna run a train on you,
then on you.

51:31.305 --> 51:33.736
Don't play games with me, Emma.
You know me.

51:33.738 --> 51:35.913
Where the fuck is the food?

51:41.425 --> 51:44.275
You wanna play like that, yeah?
Hold her down, hold her down!

51:44.277 --> 51:48.183
Oi, I'm going first.

51:56.192 --> 51:58.467
You ever been to jail before?

52:05.738 --> 52:08.202
I seen a man's face peel off

52:08.204 --> 52:11.312
right in front of
my two fucking eyes.

52:13.906 --> 52:15.537
It was like a mask.

52:15.539 --> 52:18.681
Running around the jail
screaming like a little bitch.

52:20.217 --> 52:22.555
And then he just passed out.

52:23.644 --> 52:25.468
Shock.

52:25.470 --> 52:28.030
Face nowhere to be seen.

52:28.032 --> 52:31.713
Yo, yo, yo, relax.
Relax. Relax.

52:31.715 --> 52:35.945
Relax.
You ain't goin' anywhere, man.

52:44.625 --> 52:46.928
Your sister sounds
like a good fuck, man.

52:48.021 --> 52:50.072
She wants to be a gangster.

52:53.401 --> 52:56.539
Them men don't give a shit.
They'll fuck her all night.

52:56.541 --> 52:59.421
- No!
- I'm serious.

52:59.423 --> 53:02.978
Shut up, you bint!

53:02.980 --> 53:04.999
You see, this loyalty game
you're playing...

53:07.112 --> 53:08.230
give up.

53:08.232 --> 53:09.992
Give it up straightaway.

53:11.244 --> 53:12.811
'Cause I know for a fact

53:12.813 --> 53:14.573
the big stash is in this house
somewhere.

53:14.575 --> 53:17.456
And you're going to tell me
exactly where it is,

53:17.458 --> 53:19.731
'cause no matter how much money
them pricks are paying you

53:19.733 --> 53:23.030
to stay silent, it's no use
to you now, bro.

53:23.032 --> 53:24.602
It's no use to you now.

53:30.239 --> 53:32.832
You want to head back
northwest, few drinks at Emma's?

53:32.834 --> 53:35.106
No, let's go on
a long run, M20 to Dover.

53:35.108 --> 53:37.575
All right, sweet.

53:45.517 --> 53:48.401
All right, fuck it.

53:52.437 --> 53:54.840
Hey, hold
the fucking bitch, yeah?

54:32.733 --> 54:35.072
It's Marcus.

54:36.418 --> 54:37.439
Yeah, hello.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.618
<i>Where are ya?</i>

54:39.620 --> 54:42.533
- I'm at Kerry's.
- <i>Come to Emma's.</i>

54:42.535 --> 54:44.967
<i>Just get here
as quick as you can.</i>

54:44.969 --> 54:47.021
No, worries, I'll be...

55:17.129 --> 55:19.529
I fuckin' knew it.
That fuckin' whore!

55:19.531 --> 55:22.415
She's with all of them.
See what I'm saying?

55:23.568 --> 55:25.103
Yeah.

55:25.105 --> 55:26.513
- Stay behind me, yeah?
- Yeah.

55:26.515 --> 55:29.239
- Yeah.
- Ready, yeah.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.014
Fuckin' hell, who is this?

56:01.590 --> 56:04.823
Yeah! You know it was...

56:04.825 --> 56:07.418
Junior!

56:12.417 --> 56:14.243
Fucking hell! Junior!

56:16.165 --> 56:18.216
Uggh!

56:35.352 --> 56:39.260
- The one in the passenger seat!
- Fucking hell!

56:52.840 --> 56:54.123
Get across!

56:55.500 --> 56:56.846
Go!

57:03.316 --> 57:04.470
Fuck!

57:10.043 --> 57:12.093
Marcus!

57:17.729 --> 57:20.547
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'm in!

57:28.333 --> 57:30.191
Yeah, I'm already here.

57:32.273 --> 57:34.003
What's taking so...

57:37.911 --> 57:42.778
All right, yeah, I'll meet you
at the bottom of the steps.

57:42.780 --> 57:45.664
All right, take it easy, bro,
Bye.

57:49.409 --> 57:51.201
- Can I have a light, please?
- Yeah.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.220
- So, you work at this bank then?
- Yeah.

57:53.222 --> 57:54.696
Thank you.

57:58.315 --> 58:00.302
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

58:01.902 --> 58:03.184
Have a good day.

58:08.149 --> 58:10.517
- Took your time.
- Oh, piss off.

58:10.519 --> 58:12.439
Jace, what did you want to meet
here for?

58:12.441 --> 58:13.945
Place is full
of security cameras.

58:13.947 --> 58:16.731
It's all part of it, bro.
What the fuck's that?

58:16.733 --> 58:19.069
It's all part of it,
now come on.

58:19.071 --> 58:21.471
Press the handle and the stamp
extends out of the base.

58:21.473 --> 58:24.162
That is brilliant.
Mate, that is brilliant.

58:24.164 --> 58:27.237
Just means you can go covert
pretty much wherever you want.

58:27.239 --> 58:29.832
- Where'd you get it from?
- Eh, contacts, my friend.

58:29.834 --> 58:31.722
Contacts.

58:31.724 --> 58:34.766
Well, it's for you, anyway.
It's...

58:34.768 --> 58:36.910
kind of a going-away present.

58:36.912 --> 58:39.186
- Serious?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:39.188 --> 58:41.395
Mate, I could do so much
with this stuff.

58:41.397 --> 58:43.189
That's why I want you
to have it, bro.

58:43.191 --> 58:44.983
Thank you, pal.

58:44.985 --> 58:46.553
No worries.

58:46.555 --> 58:48.571
When are you going away, anyway?

58:48.573 --> 58:50.942
- End of next week.
- Fucking hell.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.344
Kirsten's buzzing, so am I.

58:53.346 --> 58:55.140
You lucky git.

59:33.066 --> 59:35.018
You ain't got any phones
on ya, have ya?

59:35.020 --> 59:36.846
Course not.

59:44.629 --> 59:46.615
Pull up a chair.

59:51.355 --> 59:54.237
Relax. You know who I am?

59:54.239 --> 59:55.551
This is Tim, one of my cousins.

59:55.553 --> 59:59.938
So... you got robbed, then.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.564
Yeah, everything.
They took the whole lot.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.774
And they took some very bad
fucking liberties

01:00:04.776 --> 01:00:06.696
when they was doing it.

01:00:06.698 --> 01:00:09.931
The firm that got shot up
on the West End the other night?

01:00:09.933 --> 01:00:12.814
Had to be done, there and then.

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:14.514
No chance
of getting the sniff back.

01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:17.364
And I've heard that that mob
is looking for you.

01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:19.221
and they ain't gonna give up.

01:00:19.223 --> 01:00:23.034
A few others from other firms
got caught up in the crossfire.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.636
But it was the only way.

01:00:24.638 --> 01:00:27.837
You probably got half the gangs
in West London after you.

01:00:27.839 --> 01:00:30.849
Fuck 'em, Chris, they come for
me, they know what they'll get.

01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:33.540
What about the Old Bill?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:34.950
We're all lying low.

01:00:34.952 --> 01:00:36.842
None of us are about.
Everyone's tucked away.

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:42.893
I don't mean to be the bearer
of more ball-ache for you,

01:00:42.895 --> 01:00:46.065
but some Asian fella reckons
you lot have done his safe,

01:00:46.067 --> 01:00:48.246
giving him a kicking and
tried it on with his missis.

01:00:49.975 --> 01:00:53.303
He's put up a lot of dough
to have youse ironed out.

01:00:53.305 --> 01:00:55.580
Some bird grassed you up,
apparently.

01:00:59.519 --> 01:01:01.439
Anyway, luckily for you,

01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:04.354
he approached a couple of fellas
that work for us.

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:05.957
So you got a bit
of breathing space.

01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:09.255
Just bear in mind they will try
elsewhere sooner or later.

01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:11.563
OK? Maybe a firm
from over the river,

01:01:11.565 --> 01:01:14.128
maybe a firm from up north.

01:01:18.354 --> 01:01:21.876
I suppose we could just take
the money he's stakin' up,

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.959
tell him we buried them
under the motorway,

01:01:23.961 --> 01:01:26.616
split it two ways
and you stop buying your fags

01:01:26.618 --> 01:01:28.699
in his corner shop, eh?

01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:35.522
Listen, we're fucked.

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:38.053
All the money we had went into
the sniff we bought.

01:01:38.055 --> 01:01:39.526
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:42.248
Yeah, and your 80.
I'm sorry about that, mate.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.331
I promise you I'll
get that back, I swear.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:47.886
We ain't got a penny now
and we need a heavy score.

01:01:47.888 --> 01:01:49.583
To get
back to where we was.

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:52.723
And if need be, put
those fucking West Grove dealers

01:01:52.725 --> 01:01:54.839
out of business for good.

01:01:56.248 --> 01:01:58.105
That's why I brought Tim
along today.

01:01:58.107 --> 01:02:01.948
He's got details on something
you might be interested in.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.104
What is it?

01:02:05.314 --> 01:02:07.105
It's a big job.

01:02:07.107 --> 01:02:10.052
Serious amount of money
to be made.

01:02:10.054 --> 01:02:11.942
But it ain't smash-and-grab.

01:02:11.944 --> 01:02:15.049
This is firearms, full planning.

01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:17.486
Chris said that youse
could handle it.

01:02:19.759 --> 01:02:22.225
But I ain't gonna
stick it up to you,

01:02:22.227 --> 01:02:24.787
if you're then gonna turn around
and say no.

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:27.288
No, we're up for it.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.172
Right, we'll fence the goods
for a 20% commission.

01:02:34.174 --> 01:02:37.247
And we get 10% of the overall
for stickin' the job up.

01:02:37.249 --> 01:02:39.492
Done.

01:02:42.535 --> 01:02:44.550
Kraffs,
the jewellers on Bond Street.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:48.107
They're gonna have a consignment
of special gems...

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:51.120
diamonds, gold jewellery...
within the next week or so.

01:02:53.425 --> 01:02:56.854
You're looking at a face value
of at least 20 million quid.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.502
Thank you.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.602
Very good.

01:03:11.171 --> 01:03:13.284
Nice, mate.

01:03:13.286 --> 01:03:15.497
- Cheers.
- Yeah, cheers.

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:21.067
Your flights are booked.
For both you and Kirsten.

01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:22.862
Oh, thank you, Philip.

01:03:22.864 --> 01:03:24.975
We would have bought
Kirsten's ticket ourselves.

01:03:24.977 --> 01:03:26.832
No bother,
we have a deal with the airline.

01:03:26.834 --> 01:03:28.820
The office should
email them today.

01:03:28.822 --> 01:03:31.606
Sweet. I'll text Kirsten
so she knows.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:34.554
I think you'll like the flat
they've found for you.

01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:35.834
Sorry you couldn't
view it first.

01:03:35.836 --> 01:03:38.400
No, no, I'm grateful.

01:03:39.713 --> 01:03:41.599
This is New Bond Street.
There's Kraffs.

01:03:41.601 --> 01:03:43.907
Taxi pulls up, me and Dom
are gonna get out

01:03:43.909 --> 01:03:46.404
and walk in there
like we're customers.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.846
You all right with that?

01:03:47.848 --> 01:03:49.288
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.952
But it has to be convincing.

01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:53.132
They don't just let
anyone in there.

01:03:53.134 --> 01:03:54.156
So where's the goods?

01:03:54.158 --> 01:03:55.886
The shop's on two floors.

01:03:55.888 --> 01:03:57.904
The top floor is where
the jeweller sits with clients.

01:03:57.906 --> 01:04:00.467
Downstairs on the lower floor,
that's where the cabinets are.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.389
That's where the new gear is.

01:04:02.391 --> 01:04:03.766
I'll keep everyone upstairs:

01:04:03.768 --> 01:04:05.944
the jeweller, the security guard
and anyone else.

01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:08.218
All the cabinets
are finger key locked.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.780
Take the blond bird down there
and she'll open all of them.

01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:13.215
And I'm going to be waiting here
or thereabouts.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.009
As close to the shop
as possible.

01:04:15.011 --> 01:04:17.060
There's a 90-second
police response time.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.397
And Chris is going to be
up there,

01:04:19.399 --> 01:04:20.935
and it's a one-way street,

01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:23.498
so the police can only get in
from this direction.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.542
And, Nicky, I need you
to be there on the block.

01:04:26.544 --> 01:04:28.239
Don't worry,
I'll be there.

01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:29.936
You all right, brother?

01:04:29.938 --> 01:04:33.460
Yeah, I'm.... cool.
Got a few things on my mind.

01:04:33.462 --> 01:04:36.055
I'll be an hour and we'll
go through the plans again.

01:04:36.057 --> 01:04:38.232
- Where were we, bro?
- See you in a bit, yeah?

01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:40.926
- Keep your eyes open, yeah?
- Yeah, of course, mate.

01:05:16.448 --> 01:05:17.634
Fuck!

01:05:20.229 --> 01:05:21.287
Uggh!

01:05:49.923 --> 01:05:52.871
- Did you write him off?
- Yeah, it's done.

01:06:02.574 --> 01:06:03.793
Marcus!

01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:21.055
Everything OK?

01:06:21.057 --> 01:06:23.874
<i>Dr Carson, Dr Wells...</i>

01:06:23.876 --> 01:06:26.500
- Stand back there, son.
- My brother's in there!

01:06:26.502 --> 01:06:28.746
He's my son.

01:06:34.095 --> 01:06:36.816
Three entry wounds,
three exits, immediate transfer.

01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:39.189
- What's happening?
- We're taking him into theatre.

01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:47.898
I told him not
to come and see me.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.947
Said they'd be watching.

01:06:49.949 --> 01:06:52.511
Come on, let's go.

01:06:52.513 --> 01:06:54.593
Excuse me, mate.

01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:56.999
Excuse me.

01:06:58.567 --> 01:07:00.519
Detective Sergeant Baxter
from Trident,

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.121
anti-gang gun unit.

01:07:02.123 --> 01:07:04.042
- Can I have a word?
- I don't know nothing.

01:07:04.044 --> 01:07:06.219
Now, we can have a private chat
in the car

01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:08.045
or we can talk
in the nearest nick.

01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:11.348
I think you should probably
just go with him.

01:07:13.078 --> 01:07:15.477
Fine. Meet me in that cafe
at the corner.

01:07:15.479 --> 01:07:16.826
Yeah, of course.

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:33.961
What's your relationship
to Marcus Kenan?

01:07:33.963 --> 01:07:35.469
I'm his brother.

01:07:36.813 --> 01:07:38.671
Darren Kenan.

01:07:39.727 --> 01:07:41.295
Who do you think shot him?

01:07:41.297 --> 01:07:43.282
I ain't got no fucking idea.

01:07:43.284 --> 01:07:45.267
You'll have to do better
than that.

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:48.150
Well, there was a shooting
last week.

01:07:48.152 --> 01:07:50.041
Two of the West Grove crew
got killed.

01:07:50.043 --> 01:07:51.897
Your brother's name's
been mentioned,

01:07:51.899 --> 01:07:54.013
along with the names of
his three known associates.

01:07:54.015 --> 01:07:56.640
I'm not involved in that world,
so I can't help you.

01:07:56.642 --> 01:07:58.946
And my brother is
basically a straight guy,

01:07:58.948 --> 01:08:00.451
that's all I can tell you.

01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:03.333
Well, let me tell you something.

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:05.351
Your brother and his three mates
are wanted men,

01:08:05.353 --> 01:08:08.237
and if we don't nick them first,
they're dead.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:12.173
We'll be waiting for Marcus
when he recovers,

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:14.192
but if Dominic, Nicky, and Kwame
want to reach

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:17.171
old age as free men,
they need to come and see me

01:08:17.173 --> 01:08:20.631
because believe me, the other
lot will turn Queen's evidence

01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:22.555
the first chance they get.

01:08:31.684 --> 01:08:33.283
Hello?

01:08:33.286 --> 01:08:34.535
<i>Kwame up.</i>

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.962
- <i>Be quick, yeah?</i>
- All right.

01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:44.045
Right, I need to leave you here,
all right?

01:08:44.046 --> 01:08:45.327
Is everything OK?

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.153
Fine. I just need
to go somewhere.

01:08:47.154 --> 01:08:49.526
- I'll be back soon.
- OK.

01:08:56.444 --> 01:08:58.460
We're doing a job
in two days.

01:08:58.462 --> 01:09:01.215
You gotta be joking.

01:09:01.216 --> 01:09:04.899
The Old Bill got a squad out
looking for the three of you.

01:09:04.902 --> 01:09:07.846
With the heat on you now, boys,
you better bury yourselves.

01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:10.952
But, Dee, this
is a once-in-a-lifetime score.

01:09:10.953 --> 01:09:13.162
We're talking millions each,
big league.

01:09:13.165 --> 01:09:15.341
I don't even want
to know about that.

01:09:15.344 --> 01:09:16.975
You're missing the point.

01:09:16.977 --> 01:09:20.307
It's gonna be enough money
for us to just dust, get out.

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:21.779
Disappear.

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:24.279
To be honest with you,
we ain't got any other options.

01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:26.488
We'll have enough to pay
for some people we know

01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:28.282
to break Marcus
out of hospital.

01:09:28.283 --> 01:09:29.787
Marcus is under armed guard.

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:31.837
No one is busting Marcus out,
period.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.984
The second he's moved, he's
to be banged up pending trial.

01:09:33.986 --> 01:09:37.957
Then we'll bust him out
of the van on his way to court.

01:09:42.634 --> 01:09:44.170
All right, look.

01:09:44.171 --> 01:09:47.372
Let's say Marcus does
get sent down.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.359
Are you telling me
you don't want your brother

01:09:49.362 --> 01:09:51.921
to have three and a half mill
waiting for him

01:09:51.924 --> 01:09:53.140
when he gets released?

01:09:53.142 --> 01:09:55.030
Dom, what are you
telling me for?

01:09:55.032 --> 01:09:58.809
We need you to be
the fourth man.

01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:02.109
The job can't be done without
four of us, it's been planned.

01:10:02.111 --> 01:10:03.901
There were some heavy people
involved,

01:10:03.903 --> 01:10:06.017
but it's our job on the ground.

01:10:06.019 --> 01:10:08.547
There ain't no one else
we can trust to bring in.

01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:10.373
You run drugs.

01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:13.993
Think what you're asking me.
I wouldn't even know what to do.

01:10:13.995 --> 01:10:16.235
My brother's all shot up,
looking at 25 years.

01:10:16.237 --> 01:10:19.278
Dees, listen,
there's no other option.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.688
Otherwise we're dead.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.768
We need the money
for protection.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.908
Your brother needs the money,
or trust me,

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.414
he's as good as topped already.

01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:28.855
We're all on hit lists.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:32.826
I mean serious hit lists.
Do you understand?

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.589
Look there's no risk for you.

01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:37.215
We ain't asking you to do
anything you can't handle.

01:10:37.217 --> 01:10:41.251
We just need you nearby to take
the goods away on a motorbike.

01:10:41.253 --> 01:10:43.141
Just gotta take a bag.

01:10:43.143 --> 01:10:44.839
Like a courier.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.952
Keep it safe until we
collect it later, that's it.

01:10:46.954 --> 01:10:49.518
That's all it is, Dee.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:54.900
No.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.397
I'm sorry, boys.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.200
I can't do it.

01:11:02.202 --> 01:11:03.610
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:11:03.612 --> 01:11:05.628
I'm just a bit drained,
you know, bit wasted.

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:07.421
<i>Did you want me
to come over,</i>

01:11:07.423 --> 01:11:09.120
because I can come.

01:11:09.122 --> 01:11:10.111
No.

01:11:10.113 --> 01:11:11.937
No, I'm all right.

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.860
Uh...

01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:16.423
I gotta go, all right?

01:11:16.425 --> 01:11:17.704
But...

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:18.889
I love you.

01:11:18.891 --> 01:11:21.454
I love you, too.

01:11:36.093 --> 01:11:38.748
You all right?

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.544
Yeah.

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:42.083
Thanks.

01:11:43.972 --> 01:11:47.461
I didn't know what was going on.

01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:49.575
Marcus never said nothin'.

01:11:49.577 --> 01:11:51.529
It's all right, Dee.

01:11:51.531 --> 01:11:54.320
Just want Marcus to be OK.

01:12:29.874 --> 01:12:30.928
Fuck!

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.658
Mom! Mom!

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.512
Get up! Now! Move! Let's go!

01:12:40.636 --> 01:12:42.460
Fuckin'...

01:12:43.969 --> 01:12:47.201
That's my fuckin' life!
You bastards!

01:12:52.906 --> 01:12:54.568
Emma was here.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.619
She told me them cunts
firebombed the flat last night.

01:12:56.621 --> 01:12:58.445
That's all right.
I was there.

01:12:58.447 --> 01:13:00.466
I put most of it out before
the firemen even got there.

01:13:09.081 --> 01:13:10.908
Have you spoken to the boys?

01:13:12.732 --> 01:13:14.877
Yeah.

01:13:14.879 --> 01:13:17.667
Do whatever it takes
to get us out of this shit.

01:13:19.044 --> 01:13:21.123
What do you want me to do?

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.461
Dee, just do it.

01:13:23.463 --> 01:13:24.936
I need you to do it.

01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:27.626
We're in a bad fucking way,
ain't we?

01:13:27.628 --> 01:13:29.647
Don't you understand?

01:13:33.298 --> 01:13:35.220
All right.

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:38.263
I'll handle it.

01:13:48.449 --> 01:13:50.116
Here, guv.

01:14:12.345 --> 01:14:13.463
Hello, it's me.

01:14:13.465 --> 01:14:15.161
<i>So, what's happening?</i>

01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:16.634
All right, I'm in.

01:14:16.636 --> 01:14:19.229
<i>That's sweet.
It's on for tomorrow.</i>

01:14:19.231 --> 01:14:20.702
<i>So listen, yeah?</i>

01:14:22.466 --> 01:14:24.354
<i>Hi, Dee, it's Philip.
I back in Berlin now.</i>

01:14:24.356 --> 01:14:26.340
<i>You left in a bit
of a hurry the other day.</i>

01:14:26.342 --> 01:14:28.039
<i>I hope you're OK.</i>

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.665
<i>Anyway, call me when you land
in Berlin.</i>

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:31.691
<i>See you in a bit.</i>

01:16:00.228 --> 01:16:02.728
Keep the change, yeah?

01:16:27.391 --> 01:16:28.993
Come in.

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:42.252
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:45.199
Keep your hands by your side!
Get over here! Over here!

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.025
Over here! Sit! Sit!

01:16:47.027 --> 01:16:50.356
You two: hands on the table,
look natural.

01:16:50.358 --> 01:16:53.079
You, blondie, downstairs.

01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:55.805
Let's go, now!

01:16:59.007 --> 01:17:00.992
You stay exactly where you are
and keep your head down.

01:17:00.994 --> 01:17:03.717
Or I'll put one straight
in your nuts.

01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:10.506
Open it. Go on.

01:17:12.108 --> 01:17:13.615
Come on with the key!

01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:16.721
Next one, go, go!

01:17:25.434 --> 01:17:27.037
Move!

01:17:54.262 --> 01:17:55.897
Come on, quickly.

01:18:13.513 --> 01:18:14.987
Let's go.

01:18:25.589 --> 01:18:29.880
Good. Open the door.
No alarms or we start shooting.

01:18:31.516 --> 01:18:34.749
You're coming with us.
You're coming for a little walk.

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:36.928
Behave yourself
or you won't be OK.

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:37.923
Come on.

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:46.572
Thank you.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.756

01:19:33.913 --> 01:19:35.385

you're fucking going!

01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:52.715
Hey! You in the van!
Move this fucking vehicle now!

01:19:52.717 --> 01:19:54.027
I'm just reversing.

01:19:54.029 --> 01:19:55.790
Move! Get outta here!

01:20:02.742 --> 01:20:06.331
You fucking idiots!
Fuck, get out! Fuck!

01:20:14.051 --> 01:20:16.163
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck sake!

01:20:18.086 --> 01:20:19.816
Fuck, they're getting too close.

01:20:21.514 --> 01:20:22.668
They can have it.

01:20:39.163 --> 01:20:40.637
Fuck this!

01:20:42.526 --> 01:20:44.064

01:20:45.985 --> 01:20:47.428

01:20:52.649 --> 01:20:54.155
Fuck!

01:20:56.845 --> 01:20:58.412

01:22:53.634 --> 01:22:55.011
Babe, you home?

01:23:03.467 --> 01:23:05.035
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:23:05.037 --> 01:23:07.887
You, uh... you all good?
You all packed?

01:23:07.889 --> 01:23:10.576
Yeah, I think everything's
almost in order.

01:23:10.578 --> 01:23:13.364
I went and said goodbye
to some people and...

01:23:13.366 --> 01:23:15.381
Look how cute you are

01:23:15.383 --> 01:23:18.555
with your motorcycle boots
and sweatpants, I love it!

01:23:20.605 --> 01:23:22.141
Are you OK?

01:23:22.143 --> 01:23:24.511
Hey, you don't look so good.

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:27.873
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I'm just, uh...

01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:30.117
I'm just worried about Marcus
and my mum, that's all.

01:23:30.119 --> 01:23:32.231
Hmm, I know. Mwah!

01:23:32.233 --> 01:23:35.917
OK... I know what to do.

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:12.368
OK.

01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:15.538
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.459
- Where are you traveling to?
- Berlin.

01:24:17.461 --> 01:24:19.382
- His passport.
- Your passports.

01:24:19.384 --> 01:24:21.851
- Here is mine.
- OK.

01:24:24.861 --> 01:24:26.046
So...

01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:37.480
I'm gonna
check two bags.

01:24:37.482 --> 01:24:39.498
OK, please put it
on the belt.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.932
I'm gonna
take this one off.

01:24:41.934 --> 01:24:44.879
This is from my last trip.
We have two more bags.

01:24:44.881 --> 01:24:46.002
OK.

01:24:47.892 --> 01:24:50.772
- Only two pieces?
- Are you checking your bag, too?

01:24:50.774 --> 01:24:52.728
- Yeah?
- Any more bags?

01:24:52.730 --> 01:24:55.228
Yeah, just one.
I'll put it right up.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.652
OK. This is for you.

01:24:58.654 --> 01:25:00.350
Oh, perfect.
Thank you.

01:25:00.352 --> 01:25:02.209
- Enjoy your flight.
- <i>Danke schon.</i>

01:25:02.211 --> 01:25:04.226
- <i>Danke schon</i>
- OK.

01:25:04.228 --> 01:25:05.860
So we go, yes, this way.

01:25:05.862 --> 01:25:07.717
OK, we'll go through,
have a little coffee,

01:25:07.719 --> 01:25:09.126
and chill out for a bit.

01:25:09.128 --> 01:25:10.825
Yeah, sweet.

01:25:10.827 --> 01:25:12.842
- You have flown before, right?
- Hmm?

01:25:12.844 --> 01:25:15.533
I'm kidding, you're just
so on edge this morning.

01:25:15.535 --> 01:25:17.810
Sorry, yeah, I'm spaced, sorry.

01:25:29.277 --> 01:25:32.032
OK. Got it?

01:25:37.093 --> 01:25:38.885
Can I come? OK.

01:25:43.467 --> 01:25:45.647
Oh, yeah, right here.
Thank you, sorry.

01:26:12.393 --> 01:26:14.348
Is this your bag, sir?

01:26:16.076 --> 01:26:19.982
Uh, it's not a bag.
It's a stamp.

01:26:19.984 --> 01:26:22.036
I use it for my artwork.

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:27.509
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:26:27.511 --> 01:26:28.824
Thanks.

01:26:28.826 --> 01:26:30.650
It was so funny
with the customs agent.

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:33.787
I kept thinking, what
in the world is he thinking?

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:36.221
That's the thing that Jason
gave you, right?

01:26:36.223 --> 01:26:38.047
- The stamp thing?
- Yeah.

01:26:38.049 --> 01:26:40.130
Oh, my God, babe, it's awesome.
Can't wait to see it in action.

01:26:40.132 --> 01:26:42.852
I'll make some stencils for it
as soon as we settle in.

01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:45.031
Do you know what you should do?
Stamp the floor with it here.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.369
We can leave our mark
and no one would ever know.

01:26:47.371 --> 01:26:49.643
No, it's not worth it.
I don't want to cause trouble.

01:26:49.645 --> 01:26:51.918
Well...

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.641
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:56.245

The idea for my piece was,
as you see,

01:33:20.949 --> 01:33:22.901
I did these as stencils
of the first piece.

01:33:37.509 --> 01:33:41.063
