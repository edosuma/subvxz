I stole it.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.340
[ chuckles ]

08:28.342 --> 08:30.642
Yo, come sit with us.
Yeah?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.711
Okay, man. Cool.

08:32.713 --> 08:37.516
A white dude and an asian dude
bonding over a black dude.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.352
[ sighs ]
this cafeteria's ridiculous.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.653
So, I'm eddie.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.954
What's up?
Brock: Hey, dude.

08:42.956 --> 08:43.955
What's up, man?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.490
Yeah, so my cousin
told me about b.I.G.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.626
When I went to visit him
last summer, and he --

08:47.628 --> 08:49.728
Oh! What <i>is</i> that?!
Gross!

08:49.730 --> 08:51.463
It's chinese food.
My mom made it.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.664
Get it out of here!
Oh, my god!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.799
Ying ding's
eating worms.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.001
[ laughter ]

08:56.003 --> 08:57.802
Go! Go! Oh!
Get that out of here!

08:57.804 --> 09:00.472
Go!
Dude, that smells nasty!

09:00.474 --> 09:01.940
[ laughter ]

09:05.478 --> 09:07.412
Oh,
it didn't go well?

09:07.414 --> 09:10.148
The white people didn't
welcome you with open arms?

09:10.150 --> 09:13.351
<i>What?</i>
<i>Sit elsewhere, b.I.G.</i>

09:19.559 --> 09:21.660
Oh, I cannot believe
jake slept with brittany.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.261
He knew palmer woodward
was using her

09:23.263 --> 09:24.663
As part of a plot
to destroy him

09:24.665 --> 09:27.866
And help amanda take controlling
interest of melrose place.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.034
Right, jessica?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.769
Yes.
All those white people

09:30.771 --> 09:33.371
Sound like
they are making mistake.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.906
Oh, the school bus
is here!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.409
I should go see
how my boys' day was.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.410
Okay, sugar.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.378
Bye. I'm making you
a mixtape.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.780
I hope
you like eric clapton.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.781
[ laughter ]

09:42.783 --> 09:45.250
Thank you.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.518
Jessica: Hey.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.586
So, how was
your first --

09:47.588 --> 09:48.620
They said
my lunch smelled!

09:48.622 --> 09:50.121
It smelled delicious?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.590
No, they said it <i>stank,</i>
<i>mom!</i>

09:51.592 --> 09:53.258
I had to eat
behind the gym

09:53.260 --> 09:54.960
Where the janitor
flies his kite.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.696
This is nice.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.766
Well, those kids, they just
don't know, that's all.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.203
It just -- it just take time to
get used to something different.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.772
I hate it here!
I want to go back to d.C.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.041
Eddie, that's not possible.
We are here now.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.610
We have to
make the best of it.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.244
Like I am doing
with this neighbor woman.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.714
You think
I like pretending

10:15.716 --> 10:19.718
Samantha isn't carrying a baggie
of dog poops in her hand?

10:19.720 --> 10:23.455
No! I don't like this!
We all see the poops there!

10:23.457 --> 10:25.290
It's rolling around!
But I am trying!

10:25.292 --> 10:26.825
You have to try, too.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.593
You're never on my side.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.862
Eddie.
Eddie, wait!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.498
Emery: Hey, mom.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.633
This is
my girlfriend, kim.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.967
Hi, mrs. Huang.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.236
I'm gonna walk her home,
okay?
Bye, mrs. Huang.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.405
Evan: Mom.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.908
There's a fat kid at school
named j.J., and he's hilarious.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.877
Help mommy.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.082
Comic sans.
That's a funny font.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.083
Thank you.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.818
It's a great résumé.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.754
Yeah, I've always wanted to work
at a golden saddle.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.689
This isn't
a golden saddle.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.791
Yes, it is.
Isn't it?
This is cattleman's ranch.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.293
But I thought like a spin-off
of golden saddle 'cause
it's got all the same stuff.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.362
It's not the same stuff.
It's very different stuff.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.830
Well, that bear
is the same.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.532
No, that bear is brown.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.034
At golden saddle,
the bear is black.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.136
The snake skins?
Different snake.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.771
Completely different snake.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.139
Okay, yeah.
Look, you're the boss.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.774
[ laughs ] if you tell me
this is not a golden saddle,

11:15.776 --> 11:17.308
I'm gonna believe you.
No, it's completely different.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.510
You're crazy.
I am.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.878
I'm --
I mean, I'm not super crazy,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.780
'cause it does look
exactly the same.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.516
This is the original
cattleman's ranch steakhouse.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.285
So there's more than one?
N-no, there's just one.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.521
There's no other restaurant
like it, okay?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.389
Okay.
Okay.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.558
So, mitch,
tell me -- where are you from?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.659
Orlando,
born and raised.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.694
[ sighs ]
I love orlando.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.862
Where else am I gonna see
an alligator

11:37.864 --> 11:39.664
Run out on the street
and eat a cat?

11:39.666 --> 11:40.799
I am a cat person,
too.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.067
[ both laugh ]

11:42.069 --> 11:43.702
That's good.
Yeah.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.603
Mitch, you're hired.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.742
Well, evan is not
going to school today.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.344
His fat friend j.J.
Gave him string cheese,

11:53.346 --> 11:54.713
And apparently,
he is lactose intolerant.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.315
His body
is rejecting white culture,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.150
Which make me kind of proud.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.919
Good job, evan.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.021
Mom, no!
I don't want chinese lunch!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.689
I want
white-people food!

12:04.691 --> 12:06.891
The kids at school
will get used to it!

12:06.893 --> 12:09.227
Ugh!
You're never on my side.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.901
What are you doing?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.937
You're not gonna have
any lunch to eat.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.171
I'll be fine.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.107
Kids aren't teasing <i>you</i>
<i>about your lunch?</i>

12:22.109 --> 12:23.742
No, not yet.
They will.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.877
People here suck.
Totally.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.245
Hey, emery!
Hey, what's up?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.714
Oh, hey, emery. You coming to
my birthday party next weekend?

12:29.716 --> 12:30.849
Hey, george.
I'll be there.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.285
Hey, boo.
Got you a soda.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.954
Why aren't chicks
bringing <i>me</i> soda?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.589
You want it
too much.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.091
Louis:
Hey, mitch.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.860
Hey.
How's the lunch...

12:43.462 --> 12:45.563
...Crowd?

12:45.565 --> 12:46.931
It's still the same?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.433
I just think we have to
give it time, you know?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.768
Get the word out there.
No.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.569
I moved my whole family here
for this.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.105
I need your caucasian features
to work now!

12:54.107 --> 12:55.940
My wife
is not a patient woman.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.543
Do you know how many times
she tried to start a garden?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.812
Have you ever seen a woman
yelling at seeds?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.914
"grow! Grow!"
I hear you.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.383
You know,
my mom is the <i>worst</i> roommate.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.920
It's like, if you're making
toast, make us both toast.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.022
Uh, that's why
there's two slots, you know?

13:14.827 --> 13:17.662
Jessica: I talked
to my sister today.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.230
My brother bought
a brand-new miata.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.633
It's not new.
There's no way that car is new.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.767
I think it's new.
No.

13:22.769 --> 13:23.768
New.
No.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.069
It's not new.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.506
Eddie,
why are you eating so much?

13:28.508 --> 13:29.841
I'm hungry.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.075
Didn't you eat
your lunch today?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.844
Yeah,
but I'm still hungry.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.945
Oh, okay.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.847
How you like
the xiaolongbao I pack you?

13:35.849 --> 13:36.915
It was really good.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.016
Liar.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.819
I did not
pack xiaolongbao!

13:40.821 --> 13:43.988
Okay. Fine.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.824
I threw my lunch away.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.091
I cannot believe you, eddie!
Louis: Come on, eddie.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.493
That's wasteful, man.
This is good food I make.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.128
You love my food.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.263
I need
white-people lunch.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.998
That gets me a seat
at the table.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.768
And then
you get to change the rules.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.670
Represent,
like nas says.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.840
I'm not trying to eat with the
janitor for the rest of my life.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.808
I got big plans.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.944
First,
get a seat at the table.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.046
Second, meet shaq.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.515
Third, change the game.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.518
Possibly with the help
of shaq.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.354
Damn it,
that was beautiful.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.391
That filthy music you listen to
turned you into a poet, boy.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.727
Okay.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.929
What is
this white-people lunch?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.902
What is this store
so excited about?

14:30.904 --> 14:34.505
This is where
lunchables live, mom.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.977
If we get separated,
try and join a white family.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.747
You will be safe there
until I can find you.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.223
Whoa.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.026
This is not
how I like to shop.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.862
This place
looks like a hospital.

14:57.864 --> 14:58.830
[ sighs ]

14:58.832 --> 15:00.899
I miss the taiwanese markets
back in d.C.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.567
They make me feel
so calm.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.470
[ shouting in chinese ]

15:12.111 --> 15:13.645
[ sighs ]

15:14.613 --> 15:16.214
Wow.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.183
Everything fits perfectly
inside the box.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.785
Awesome!

15:20.787 --> 15:23.388
You want
to fit inside a box?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.189
That's so american.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.292
Why are you
so american?

15:27.294 --> 15:28.760
Fiesta tortilla chip?
Free sample.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.629
This is free?
Okay!

15:37.069 --> 15:38.303
How are you doing?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.204
Everyone getting ready
for the shoot? You good, nancy?

15:40.206 --> 15:42.307
Can I have Saturday off?
I'm deejaying a bat mitzvah.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.741
Nope.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.244
Hey, joe, no margaritas
till after the shoot, okay?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.479
[ chuckles ] okay.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.381
Hey, mr. Cattleman.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.116
How we feeling?
We all ready to go?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.551
Uh, not really.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.153
I feel like
I've told you numerous times.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.889
I don't want to do this,
but all you do is smile and nod.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.123
[ chuckles ]

15:59.125 --> 16:00.959
No, you're doing it.
No, that -- you're doing it.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.727
What is all this, louis?

16:02.729 --> 16:05.630
We are shooting
a local commercial.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.831
[ chuckles ]

16:06.833 --> 16:09.067
A commercial?
Why didn't you tell me?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.235
How much
is this going to cost us?!

16:11.237 --> 16:12.971
Come here.
Come on.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.507
I miss our family and friends
in washington, d.C.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.010
And eddie's having
a hard time at school.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.912
And evan
is lactose intolerant.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.313
And emery --

16:22.315 --> 16:24.315
Well, emery's doing
surprisingly well.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.118
But all you care about
is the stupid restaurant,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.287
Which is the whole reason
I agreed to move here!

16:29.289 --> 16:31.122
Because you say
it was doing well!

16:31.124 --> 16:33.758
It's not doing well!
And so I am worried about money.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.160
And look at my hair!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.162
My hair is terrible!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.498
Your hair is terrible,
but so was mine.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.467
And I fixed it
using product.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.535
I love
that you have big dreams,

16:44.537 --> 16:47.372
But I don't want
to lose everything, louis.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.373
Let's just go home.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.707
We can't do that.
Why?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.542
What's so important
we had to move here

16:51.544 --> 16:53.611
And change
our whole lives?

16:53.613 --> 16:57.015
Sorry to interrupt,
mr. Huang.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.783
The burro is ready
for blocking.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.286
Thank you, nancy.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.389
We'll discuss this later.
