00:27.320 --> 00:31.960
Turn it down! Turn the music down!

00:47.960 --> 00:50.959
'The moments until launch ticking away,

00:50.960 --> 00:55.500
'we're joined live from Oxford
Observatory by Professor Adam Drake.

00:55.501 --> 00:57.133
'Can you hear me, Professor?

00:57.134 --> 00:59.442
'Yes, Peter, I can hear you.'

00:59.443 --> 01:02.159
I understand your team
will be monitoring the launch,

01:02.160 --> 01:04.687
and tracking Apollo
as it approaches the moon.

01:04.688 --> 01:07.319
Well, Peter, the tracking
will be done by our colleagues

01:07.320 --> 01:09.959
at Jodrell Bank, but we will,
of course, be analysing the data.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.283
He's very good, isn't he?

01:21.186 --> 01:22.186
Tell me.

01:22.781 --> 01:25.780
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.692
She's always been selfish.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.643
And we've given her everything.

01:37.668 --> 01:39.667
Oh, it's all attention seeking.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.294
I suppose it'll be to do with
some boy she's been mooning over.

01:43.295 --> 01:47.319
'And how will Armstrong, Aldrin
and Collins be feeling right now?'

01:47.320 --> 01:48.646
Well, I think it's safe to say

01:48.647 --> 01:50.960
they'll be feeling a mixture
of trepidation and excitement.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.726
'Ten.

01:58.751 --> 01:59.949
'Nine.

01:59.974 --> 02:01.773
'Ignition sequence has begun.

02:01.798 --> 02:02.798
'Six.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.833
'Five.

02:03.858 --> 02:04.833
'Four.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.833
'Three. Two.

02:06.858 --> 02:08.303
'One.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.328
'Lift off.

02:09.741 --> 02:13.383
'That is lift off
at 32 minutes past the hour.

02:13.408 --> 02:15.804
'Lift off for Apollo 11.

02:18.593 --> 02:21.593
'The rocket is now
clear of the launch tower.'

02:40.960 --> 02:43.692
One more for Professor Drake.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.556
It looked perfect to me.

02:45.581 --> 02:48.260
Yes, well, when you're
a professor of astrophysics,

02:48.285 --> 02:49.765
we'll take your word for it.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.847
The woman from the village
who does for us

03:36.848 --> 03:38.707
brought it back from Spain.

03:38.708 --> 03:39.959
As a present!

03:39.960 --> 03:40.960
Look.

03:40.961 --> 03:42.523
Oh!

03:43.960 --> 03:45.999
Oh! Adam, darling!

03:46.000 --> 03:47.460
You made it!

03:47.461 --> 03:48.960
How are you?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.960
This is, er, Christine.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.523
Oh!

03:57.156 --> 03:59.795
Course, the other wives are just green.

03:59.796 --> 04:01.938
The bursar's wife said to me
the other day, she said,

04:01.939 --> 04:05.795
"Being married to Larry must be like
being married to an astronaut."

04:05.796 --> 04:08.210
My little television piece
went over well, don't you think?

04:08.211 --> 04:11.795
You might have made more of the part
played by British know-how.

04:11.796 --> 04:15.378
No Tom Bacon, no fuel cells,
no fuel cells, no moon.

04:15.379 --> 04:18.302
Bacon must be 65 if he's a day,
and Cambridge.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.795
Let the fens claim him. Oxford has
a young Helios Apollo of its own.

04:21.796 --> 04:23.836
I thought you were bloody brilliant.

04:25.283 --> 04:26.796
Excuse me for a minute.

04:31.642 --> 04:33.641
You know, I think
if you really applied yourself,

04:33.666 --> 04:36.163
you could probably get the whole
of your tongue up his exhaust.

04:41.316 --> 04:43.394
They're a bit square, aren't they?

04:43.419 --> 04:45.419
Couldn't we make our excuses?

05:34.796 --> 05:38.219
'Unit 3 to DCI Box.
All units in position, guv'nor.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.382
'Standing by.'

05:39.383 --> 05:40.796
Five minutes yet.

05:42.796 --> 05:44.795
Young eel.

05:44.796 --> 05:46.475
Five letters.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.795
Elver.

05:47.796 --> 05:51.156
E-L-V-E-R.

06:06.796 --> 06:07.796
Morse.

06:10.388 --> 06:11.795
'Wages van in view.

06:11.796 --> 06:12.796
'It's on, boss.'

06:12.796 --> 06:13.796
Right.

06:13.797 --> 06:16.155
Now, best stay in the car, Fred.
These boys are handy.

06:16.156 --> 06:17.426
I'm all right.

06:17.427 --> 06:18.486
I know you are.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.796
I'd just sooner you stayed
on the bench for this one.

06:31.796 --> 06:32.995
Morning, sir.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.835
Morse! Good heavens!

06:34.836 --> 06:37.493
Well, what's this?
I thought you were out by Woodstock.

06:37.494 --> 06:40.277
I had notice from Division
to transfer back to CID in town.

06:40.278 --> 06:42.403
- Started this morning.
- Indeed.

06:42.689 --> 06:44.688
Well, that is good news.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.795
- Suspicious?
- Seemingly not.

06:47.796 --> 06:49.795
Then what warrants the presence of CID

06:49.796 --> 06:52.795
and an officer of senior rank
at a common or garden RTA?

06:52.796 --> 06:55.795
The driver's a Professor Adam Drake.

06:55.796 --> 06:57.796
- The moon man?
- Ah.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.835
Any other vehicles involved?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.836
Not according to Accident Investigation.

07:04.349 --> 07:06.508
- Well, there's no skid marks.
- Asleep at the wheel, possibly?

07:06.533 --> 07:08.052
Alcohol, perhaps.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.556
And speed.

07:09.581 --> 07:10.581
Right.

07:18.328 --> 07:19.488
Police!

07:28.796 --> 07:29.996
Hey, hey, hey!

08:13.796 --> 08:15.315
Fred?!

08:15.316 --> 08:16.796
Go. Go. Go.

08:28.796 --> 08:30.796
Told you to stay in the car, didn't I?

08:46.203 --> 08:47.795
I wouldn't get too close.

08:47.796 --> 08:49.835
Exsanguination.

08:49.836 --> 08:52.274
Distinct smell of alcohol from his mouth.

08:52.275 --> 08:55.857
Some sort of vermouth, to my nose,
but you may have a better...

08:55.858 --> 08:57.198
I'll take your word for it.

08:57.199 --> 09:00.635
Straight-forward drink-drive, then?
Showing off for the girl?

09:00.636 --> 09:02.043
These were in his pocket.

09:03.796 --> 09:05.422
Drake's, presumably.

09:05.423 --> 09:08.475
The car belongs to a Dr Laurence Humbolt.

09:08.476 --> 09:10.636
- Address in North Oxford.
- Hm.

09:11.435 --> 09:12.595
What about his passenger?

09:13.796 --> 09:15.283
Oh, I haven't got to her yet.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.923
Thrown clear, by the look of things.

09:19.796 --> 09:20.796
Now...

09:23.415 --> 09:25.454
Well, there's a thing.

09:25.836 --> 09:27.936
Liver mortis.

09:27.937 --> 09:30.457
This purpling you see here.

09:30.458 --> 09:34.795
Once the heart stops pumping,
blood settles according to gravity.

09:34.796 --> 09:36.835
It should be on the other side
of her face?

09:36.836 --> 09:39.315
There's also a marked lack of bleeding

09:39.316 --> 09:41.574
from the laceration to her forehead.

09:41.575 --> 09:44.003
So she was dead
before the car hit the tree.

09:44.796 --> 09:46.477
That could be why there's no skid marks.

09:46.478 --> 09:47.835
He crashed the car intentionally?

09:47.836 --> 09:50.363
A dead girl on board?
Perhaps he had cause.

10:01.796 --> 10:03.082
Is DI Thursday about?

10:03.443 --> 10:05.475
He's with the sawbones.

10:05.923 --> 10:07.795
This morning's stake-out, it...

10:07.796 --> 10:09.635
got a bit lively.

10:09.636 --> 10:11.795
- He's all right, though?
- He's still standing.

10:11.796 --> 10:12.796
Is this yours?

10:12.797 --> 10:14.803
Oh, yes, I couldn't see a desk.

10:15.796 --> 10:16.836
No.

10:26.675 --> 10:28.923
Well, I'll let you get settled in.

10:39.796 --> 10:41.315
Light duties?

10:41.316 --> 10:42.796
Couple of weeks.

10:44.156 --> 10:45.795
There's no shame in it.

10:45.796 --> 10:46.796
I'm fine.

10:48.729 --> 10:49.768
I'm sure.

10:50.243 --> 10:51.796
But better safe.

10:53.476 --> 10:54.796
Any word?

10:56.542 --> 10:57.843
Bastards got away.

10:58.796 --> 11:00.043
But don't worry.

11:01.255 --> 11:02.415
I'll have 'em.

11:04.796 --> 11:06.003
They're owed.

11:17.796 --> 11:18.796
Oh!

11:26.722 --> 11:27.722
Sir.

11:31.883 --> 11:33.796
I hear there's been some excitement.

11:34.796 --> 11:38.796
Yeah, just a... bit of rough and tumble.

11:39.796 --> 11:42.796
Only upstairs has stuck me
on light duties.

11:43.796 --> 11:44.796
You?

11:46.482 --> 11:47.641
Car crash.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.026
Supposedly.

11:50.089 --> 11:52.089
But looks more like a murder-suicide.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.584
If you've nothing on...?

11:57.609 --> 11:58.609
Well...

11:59.796 --> 12:02.795
...I could help you out, I suppose,

12:02.796 --> 12:04.043
if you wanted.

12:04.796 --> 12:07.483
I mean, I'd need to clear it.

12:07.796 --> 12:10.795
Looks like the driver did
for the girl before doing himself.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.795
We just need to put a name to her.

12:13.796 --> 12:14.796
Fair enough.

12:15.509 --> 12:17.509
Just don't overdo it.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.290
Office all right?

12:20.315 --> 12:23.283
We didn't have space up here, but to
be honest, I wasn't expecting you.

12:24.316 --> 12:25.795
Friends in high places, eh?

12:25.796 --> 12:26.796
Hardly.

12:27.225 --> 12:28.795
Well, somebody pulled strings
at Division,

12:28.796 --> 12:30.816
or you'd still be counting cabbages
out in the sticks.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.795
Look, I didn't ask for a transfer.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.795
I don't know why I'm here
any more than you do.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.380
But no-one at Division's
going to be doing me any favours.

12:38.381 --> 12:39.796
If you're ready, then, Morse?

12:50.796 --> 12:52.083
Aye-aye, Joanie.

12:52.796 --> 12:53.796
What's all this, then?

12:53.797 --> 12:55.316
Hello, Jim.

12:55.996 --> 12:57.795
Criminal damage.

12:58.203 --> 12:59.795
Flora Humbolt.

12:59.796 --> 13:01.843
Burned down a guides' hut.

13:02.488 --> 13:03.488
Nice girl.

13:03.797 --> 13:05.835
Hoping to avoid a custodial.

13:05.836 --> 13:08.155
Get you with all the lingo.

13:08.156 --> 13:10.795
We nick 'em, you see 'em
back out on the streets.

13:10.796 --> 13:13.043
What is it - trouble at home?

13:13.796 --> 13:17.843
Her mother says it's to do
with a boy, but I'm not so sure.

13:18.168 --> 13:20.403
Some of 'em are just
born under a bad sign.

13:20.796 --> 13:22.883
All the welfare in the world
won't save 'em.

13:23.142 --> 13:26.141
Maybe, but 13's a bit young to
be written off, don't you think?

13:26.796 --> 13:28.155
What about you? What are you on?

13:28.156 --> 13:31.796
Oh, just a bit of this and that.

13:34.062 --> 13:37.323
Good luck with your girl, anyway.
Mind how you go.

13:40.796 --> 13:42.795
The car's a cut and shut.

13:42.796 --> 13:44.795
Two write-offs welded together.

13:44.796 --> 13:46.795
Looks the part,
but no structural integrity.

13:46.796 --> 13:49.795
A collision and the thing just, er,
disintegrates.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.835
Log book?

13:50.836 --> 13:52.475
Worthy of Nevil Shute.

13:52.476 --> 13:54.995
Which is no surprise, seeing as he
bought it from the Winsome Welshmen.

13:54.996 --> 13:56.155
Dudley and Dunstan.

13:56.156 --> 13:57.795
Weren't they a front for Eddie Nero?

13:57.796 --> 13:58.796
One of many.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.155
He did a moonlight when he went west.

14:01.156 --> 14:02.523
You won't get any change there.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.634
Be glad of a motor from the pool
if there's one going spare, Mac.

14:06.659 --> 14:07.659
All spoken for, Fred.

14:08.123 --> 14:09.796
What about number nine?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.795
What's wrong with it?

14:24.796 --> 14:26.795
Nothing. It's just had its day, is all.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.635
We've got it down for scrap or spares.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.965
I've got a nondy
coming in for an oil change,

14:30.966 --> 14:32.803
if you give me half an hour.

14:33.602 --> 14:36.601
'Hard to imagine the thoughts
that will be passing through

14:36.626 --> 14:38.625
'the minds of Armstrong, Aldrin
and Collins

14:38.796 --> 14:41.243
'as they say goodbye to the Earth,

14:41.542 --> 14:43.542
'and venture out into the vast..'

15:06.388 --> 15:08.227
I've drawn blood from both of them

15:08.228 --> 15:11.323
and asked the lab to make it a priority.

15:12.028 --> 15:16.027
But I would expect them to report
a fairly high level of intoxication,

15:16.028 --> 15:19.027
if stomach contents
are anything to go by.

15:19.028 --> 15:21.387
- Always a pleasure, Doctor.
- What, for both of them?

15:21.388 --> 15:24.027
His, otherwise empty.

15:24.028 --> 15:29.027
Hers, final meal of pineapple,
sausages and cheese,

15:29.028 --> 15:31.707
ingested within two hours of her decease.

15:31.708 --> 15:32.822
Which was when?

15:32.823 --> 15:34.761
Between midnight and three o'clock.

15:34.762 --> 15:36.752
Anything as to cause with her?

15:36.753 --> 15:41.272
Single blunt trauma to the parietal,
leading to sub-dural haematoma,

15:41.273 --> 15:46.753
increased pressure on the brain
stem, and arrivederci, Roma.

15:47.753 --> 15:49.752
What about her personal effects?

15:49.753 --> 15:52.085
No money, purse, keys? Nothing like that?

15:52.086 --> 15:53.432
No. Just what's there.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.043
The dress and the shoes.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.265
That was his. From his left wrist.

15:57.963 --> 15:59.752
Don't suppose
you've got a name for her yet?

15:59.753 --> 16:01.112
What we're about.

16:01.563 --> 16:04.272
Post-mortem photo
wouldn't go amiss in that regard.

16:04.273 --> 16:05.752
Ah.

16:05.753 --> 16:07.051
Thought that might be the case.

16:07.052 --> 16:08.323
All my own work.

16:09.483 --> 16:10.752
Mind how you go.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.593
Inspector. Morse.

16:22.323 --> 16:24.752
No next of kin, according to the bursar.

16:25.203 --> 16:26.752
Drake was an only child.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.752
Mother died when he was young,

16:28.753 --> 16:31.097
Father about two years ago.
Anything here?

16:31.098 --> 16:32.283
Nothing.

16:33.499 --> 16:34.659
Cheese and pineapple.

16:35.753 --> 16:37.752
We had that at our silver wedding.

16:37.753 --> 16:38.753
On sticks.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.210
A party, do you think?

16:41.211 --> 16:43.412
Cocktail sausages, heavy drinking?

16:43.413 --> 16:47.171
With this Humbolt character, maybe.
That's where Drake got the car.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.323
Hm.

16:49.753 --> 16:50.753
Anything on him yet?

16:51.283 --> 16:53.020
They're colleagues, said the bursar.

16:53.021 --> 16:54.753
Over at the observatory.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.753
How To Live A Happier Life.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.083
Maybe he never finished it.

17:05.752 --> 17:08.112
'Each of us can have anything we want,

17:08.113 --> 17:10.432
'anything in the world.

17:10.433 --> 17:12.752
'But so often we deny ourselves,

17:12.752 --> 17:15.242
'because we don't think we deserve it.'

17:15.752 --> 17:19.752
How is it Professor Drake
was driving your car, Dr Humbolt?

17:21.163 --> 17:23.133
His wouldn't start, apparently.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.752
He found me in the garden
and asked if he could borrow mine.

17:28.753 --> 17:32.340
Then, presumably the vehicle is
still at your house, Dr Wingqvist?

17:32.341 --> 17:35.752
Yes, it's... Well, I expected
a mechanic to fix it this morning.

17:35.753 --> 17:37.752
There was a young woman
found at the scene of the crash,

17:37.753 --> 17:39.752
for whom we don't have a name.

17:39.753 --> 17:41.752
I must warn you,
it's a post-mortem photograph,

17:41.753 --> 17:44.363
but can you confirm that this is
who Professor Drake was with?

17:44.753 --> 17:48.432
Yes, I believe that's her, but...
I've a terrible memory for names.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.607
Adam's girls never really hung
around long enough

17:50.608 --> 17:52.453
to make it worthwhile
learning their names.

17:52.454 --> 17:54.272
Bit of a ladies' man, was he?

17:54.273 --> 17:55.752
Making up for lost time, perhaps.

17:55.753 --> 17:57.752
Most of us have a misspent youth.

17:57.753 --> 17:59.752
Adam didn't really have a youth at all.

17:59.753 --> 18:01.752
Mathematical child prodigy.

18:01.753 --> 18:04.071
Entered Oxford at the age of 12,

18:04.072 --> 18:06.753
and was appointed
Copernican chair at just 23.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.752
How would you describe
Professor Drake's temperament?

18:10.753 --> 18:14.540
Quite highly strung, despite the
appearance he gave on television.

18:14.541 --> 18:15.752
He could fly off the handle.

18:15.753 --> 18:16.753
Violently?

18:16.754 --> 18:18.752
He had a temper.

18:18.753 --> 18:20.752
How did they seem
with each other last night?

18:20.753 --> 18:23.592
You weren't aware of any...
ill feeling between them?

18:23.593 --> 18:24.752
They didn't have words?

18:24.753 --> 18:26.083
No.

18:26.753 --> 18:28.197
Er, no, Larry, were you...?

18:28.198 --> 18:29.963
I can't say as I noticed anything.

18:32.953 --> 18:36.169
'Everyone thinks I have the perfect life.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.752
'I suppose looking at it
from the outside I do.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.752
'Perfect marriage.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.163
'Perfect husband.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.187
'Perfect children. Perfect house.

18:44.753 --> 18:49.753
'But every morning I wake up,
I just want to scream.'

18:53.753 --> 18:56.273
I don't suppose
that's the first of those, is it?

18:59.753 --> 19:01.753
Or the last.

19:04.753 --> 19:06.793
I wish it had been you.

19:10.753 --> 19:12.753
So do I.

19:22.763 --> 19:24.753
These are the keys Drake had on him.

19:25.953 --> 19:27.342
Hm.

19:27.343 --> 19:29.483
Well, if they're not his, whose are they?

19:46.674 --> 19:47.958
It's a pay slip.

19:48.247 --> 19:49.312
Christine Chase.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.753
Heaviside Studios.

19:52.953 --> 19:55.752
Mrs Wingqvist is upstairs.

19:56.283 --> 19:57.753
The police, ma'am.

19:59.203 --> 20:00.952
Thank you, Mrs Trellis.

20:01.741 --> 20:03.112
Oh, the, erm...

20:03.113 --> 20:05.611
the bath plughole is blocked again.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.432
Hair, is it?

20:07.433 --> 20:10.821
Erm, I don't know what it is,
but if you could pick it out?

20:10.822 --> 20:12.243
Thank you.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.752
Natalie Wingqvist.

20:15.753 --> 20:20.752
You, erm, you spoke to my husband,
I believe, about Adam.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.753
That's right, madam.

20:22.123 --> 20:26.752
There was a young woman also at the
scene that we're trying to identify,

20:26.753 --> 20:30.592
presumably the girl that Drake
was here with last night.

20:30.593 --> 20:32.752
Christine Chase, would that be right?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.883
Yes, I think that was it.

20:35.753 --> 20:37.753
How did they seem together?

20:40.753 --> 20:43.112
They kept to themselves pretty much.

20:43.113 --> 20:45.753
I think she found us all rather dry.

20:47.753 --> 20:51.752
Your husband said they left around
one o'clock. Would that be right?

20:51.753 --> 20:53.617
If that's what Elliot said.

20:53.618 --> 20:56.752
I'm afraid I didn't see them go.
It was all very casual.

20:56.753 --> 20:58.752
You know what parties are like.

20:58.753 --> 21:00.752
People just slip away.

21:01.139 --> 21:02.139
Hm.

21:18.753 --> 21:21.027
I'm sorry to have kept you. Jeff Slayton.

21:21.028 --> 21:23.752
My sister, Hildy.
The real brains of the business.

21:23.753 --> 21:25.752
Reception said you were from the police?

21:25.753 --> 21:27.752
DI Thursday, DS Morse. Thames Valley.

21:27.753 --> 21:31.592
We're here about Christine Chase.
I believe she works here.

21:31.593 --> 21:34.592
Chrissie? Lovely girl. Very bright.

21:34.593 --> 21:35.752
She's my personal assistant.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.752
But if you wanted to speak to her,
I'm afraid she's not in today.

21:38.753 --> 21:40.215
When did you see her last?

21:40.216 --> 21:43.243
Yesterday evening,
around six thirty. Why?

21:44.003 --> 21:47.163
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
but... she's been killed.

21:48.753 --> 21:50.112
What?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.752
Oh, no!

21:51.753 --> 21:52.753
How?!

21:53.283 --> 21:56.003
Her body was found at the scene
of a car crash.

21:57.753 --> 21:59.752
That's awful. Where?

21:59.753 --> 22:01.752
Out towards Edenbury.

22:02.409 --> 22:04.398
The car was being driven by
a Professor Drake.

22:04.983 --> 22:06.062
Adam?

22:06.063 --> 22:08.272
Yes. Do you know him?

22:08.273 --> 22:11.132
He's the scientific advisor
on Moon Rangers, our latest show.

22:11.133 --> 22:13.752
It's a sort of Bonanza in space.
Is he all right?

22:14.483 --> 22:16.206
I'm afraid he's also deceased.

22:17.283 --> 22:19.753
We'd like to speak to her colleagues
if that's possible?

22:21.196 --> 22:23.792
Barbara's not only my daughter, Major,

22:23.793 --> 22:28.752
but she's also a renowned
astrophysicist in her own right.

22:28.753 --> 22:30.752
I warned her not to go, Colonel.

22:30.753 --> 22:33.167
Now, she's out there
somewhere on the dark side,

22:33.168 --> 22:36.163
with only 30 minutes of oxygen left.

22:36.753 --> 22:38.923
Don't blame yourself, Rock.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.171
She was determined to get
that space-flu vaccine

22:42.172 --> 22:46.163
through to the miners at Station X-1-9.

22:52.753 --> 22:54.752
Sorry, everyone. Got our wires crossed.

22:55.239 --> 22:56.239
Cut.

22:57.433 --> 22:59.963
If I might have your attention
a moment...

23:00.753 --> 23:02.752
I'm afraid I've got some terrible news.

23:03.363 --> 23:09.753
Christine from the office and, erm,
Professor Drake... A-Adam...

23:11.753 --> 23:13.283
I, erm...

23:15.753 --> 23:18.923
There was a car accident last night.

23:20.753 --> 23:22.043
They were both killed.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.752
And how would you describe Miss Chase?

23:24.753 --> 23:26.752
I didn't really know her,

23:26.753 --> 23:29.752
but Marilyn was quite close to Christine.

23:29.753 --> 23:32.211
That'd be Marilyn who, Mr Gidby?

23:32.212 --> 23:33.752
Oh, it's my wife.

23:33.753 --> 23:36.752
She works with me on the gantry
as a puppeteer.

23:36.753 --> 23:39.112
What about Professor Drake?
Did you know him at all?

23:39.113 --> 23:42.752
Oh, yes. He came by to watch
some of the filming yesterday.

23:43.443 --> 23:44.752
What was he like?

23:45.203 --> 23:46.752
Oh...

23:46.753 --> 23:48.752
Very full of himself, as always.

23:48.753 --> 23:50.952
This wasn't right, and that wasn't right.

23:51.443 --> 23:54.752
Mostly, he was banging on about
some course he'd been taking.

23:54.753 --> 23:56.283
What sort of course?

23:56.753 --> 23:58.283
I couldn't say.

23:59.323 --> 24:00.752
You didn't care for him?

24:00.753 --> 24:02.752
He was all right, I suppose.

24:02.753 --> 24:05.752
But you always got the idea
he was looking down his nose at you.

24:07.753 --> 24:09.752
Sorry. Just a shock.

24:09.753 --> 24:11.752
They were asking after Adam.

24:11.753 --> 24:14.433
What was that course he was taking?

24:15.753 --> 24:18.752
Something in Parktown, wasn't it?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.752
And how would you describe Miss Chase?

24:22.123 --> 24:23.752
- She was nice.
- Hm-mm.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.752
Sweet. Quite shy.

24:25.753 --> 24:28.283
Had she and Professor Drake
been together long?

24:29.753 --> 24:32.952
They'd been out
a couple of times for drinks.

24:33.523 --> 24:35.189
She was afraid of him.

24:35.190 --> 24:37.388
I thought he was a bit of a show-off,

24:37.389 --> 24:39.003
being on the telly, I suppose.

24:39.793 --> 24:43.451
He wouldn't miss a chance
to make you feel small.

24:43.452 --> 24:47.752
So, they leave this party,
park up somewhere, presumably,

24:47.753 --> 24:50.753
she ends up dead, and he does
for himself by crashing the car.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.752
You be all right to let her parents know?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.112
Let them know what, exactly?

24:56.603 --> 24:57.952
We don't know what happened.

24:57.953 --> 25:01.432
Only two people know what happened
in that car, and they're both dead.

25:01.919 --> 25:03.238
No point milking it.

25:03.263 --> 25:05.163
Well, we want to be sure, don't we?

25:05.753 --> 25:08.043
For her sake, and for his.

25:08.753 --> 25:11.592
It's somebody's reputation
that we're talking about.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.792
It's about what you can prove.
You know that.

25:14.043 --> 25:16.752
Drake thought we'd take the crash
at face value.

25:16.753 --> 25:17.753
He didn't count on you.

25:17.754 --> 25:22.752
First day back. Well done.
Now go and have a pint.

25:23.163 --> 25:25.752
'Well, whatever Drake did,
he's past justice now.'

25:25.753 --> 25:27.752
But whose are the car keys
he had in his pocket?

25:27.753 --> 25:30.222
If they're not his, they're not
hers, then whose are they?

25:30.223 --> 25:31.752
Car keys? That's what you're sticking on?

25:31.753 --> 25:34.112
If it was my daughter lost
in suspicious circumstances,

25:34.113 --> 25:36.432
I'd want more than an open verdict,
wouldn't you?

25:36.433 --> 25:38.752
- It's the guv'nor's call.
- He's not my guv'nor.

25:38.753 --> 25:40.753
He is now,
and you'd do well to remember it.

25:42.753 --> 25:43.753
Right, I'm off.

25:44.523 --> 25:46.174
Well, I'll pick you up in the morning.

25:46.175 --> 25:47.752
No, don't worry about that.

25:48.403 --> 25:49.883
Light duties, remember?

25:51.003 --> 25:52.752
What did happen?

25:53.163 --> 25:54.450
They had a pick handle.

25:54.451 --> 25:55.753
I didn't.

25:56.883 --> 25:58.753
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:05.753 --> 26:06.753
Morse.

26:15.133 --> 26:16.333
Home.

26:25.753 --> 26:27.198
You going somewhere?

26:27.199 --> 26:28.752
I'm out tonight.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.752
Oh! Yeah?

26:31.293 --> 26:33.293
Shouldn't be late.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.752
You had tea?

26:36.753 --> 26:37.792
Bit of shepherd's pie.

26:37.793 --> 26:40.752
Oh, smashing.

26:41.523 --> 26:42.753
At work.

26:44.593 --> 26:46.753
Oh. Right.

26:47.753 --> 26:50.792
I thought you could get yourself
something from the chip shop.

26:51.603 --> 26:52.753
Yeah.

26:55.753 --> 26:58.272
Yeah, I'll probably do that.

26:58.643 --> 26:59.752
Right, then.

27:00.763 --> 27:02.753
Don't wait up.

27:51.072 --> 27:52.072
Mac?

27:54.953 --> 27:56.752
So, what is it that couldn't wait?

27:56.753 --> 27:58.272
The brakes had been bled.

27:58.273 --> 28:00.752
There's not a drop of fluid in them
or the reservoir.

28:01.323 --> 28:02.752
And that couldn't have
happened in the crash?

28:02.753 --> 28:04.752
No, not a chance.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.526
This was sabotage.

28:09.363 --> 28:10.753
Right.

28:13.975 --> 28:16.654
Somebody bled the brakes on the car
that Drake was driving,

28:16.655 --> 28:18.974
which is why there were no skid
marks at the site of the crash.

28:18.975 --> 28:21.494
Yeah, it also means that Drake
couldn't have pulled over

28:21.495 --> 28:22.974
to kill Christine Chase,

28:22.975 --> 28:26.974
so she must have already been dead
when he drove away from the party.

28:26.975 --> 28:28.694
How'd she die again?

28:28.695 --> 28:30.403
Head trauma. Single blow.

28:31.363 --> 28:33.290
Drake was driving
Humbolt's car, wasn't he?

28:33.315 --> 28:34.355
That's right, sir.

28:34.356 --> 28:36.974
We're assuming whoever bled the
brakes had it in for Mr Humbolt.

28:36.975 --> 28:39.014
He's rubbed somebody up
the wrong way, you reckon?

28:40.043 --> 28:41.123
Right.

28:41.975 --> 28:43.288
I'll take it from here.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.161
So much for open and shut.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.974
Well, that was your assessment, not mine.

28:48.975 --> 28:50.563
I said that we should
get to the bottom of it.

28:53.807 --> 28:55.806
Let's get one thing straight -

28:55.975 --> 28:58.243
you go digging when I've told you not to,

28:58.655 --> 29:00.654
you'll be on the first bus out.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.317
I thought we were here to get
to the truth of what happened!

29:03.318 --> 29:05.974
No. You're here to follow my orders.

29:05.975 --> 29:07.974
If that's going to be difficult for you,

29:07.975 --> 29:09.974
I suggest you put in for a transfer.

29:10.323 --> 29:11.763
Meantime...

29:12.975 --> 29:14.763
you're dismissed, Sergeant.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.099
Cocky little bastard.

29:19.495 --> 29:20.974
He's a good officer.

29:20.975 --> 29:22.603
He's a condescending little prick!

29:24.563 --> 29:25.975
I'll take it from here.

29:27.443 --> 29:29.975
You don't mean somebody meant for it
to happen...

29:31.495 --> 29:32.975
You're not serious?

29:34.528 --> 29:35.554
But...

29:35.579 --> 29:36.975
I don't drive.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.974
Not at the moment, anyway.

29:38.975 --> 29:42.450
The car's in my name,
but I was disqualified from driving

29:42.451 --> 29:43.974
for a year last September.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.975
So who drove your car to the Wingqvists?

29:50.394 --> 29:51.394
Flora!

29:51.552 --> 29:52.974
Your job to collect the balls.

29:52.975 --> 29:55.654
How am I supposed to serve
if I don't have a ball?

29:55.655 --> 29:56.974
And don't scowl!

29:56.975 --> 29:58.974
It makes you look very ugly.

29:59.323 --> 30:01.334
And see if Matthew wants a drink.

30:01.803 --> 30:02.974
Why don't you see?

30:02.975 --> 30:04.814
You're his mother!

30:04.815 --> 30:06.974
How dare you?!

30:07.603 --> 30:09.146
Do you see what I have to put up with?

30:09.147 --> 30:11.174
Darling, do you have a moment?

30:11.175 --> 30:13.083
These gentlemen are from the police.

30:15.975 --> 30:17.975
Hi, sweetheart.

30:19.803 --> 30:21.461
Would you excuse us, please,
Miss Wingqvist?

30:21.462 --> 30:23.974
I might be able to help, mightn't I?
If it's about Adam.

30:23.975 --> 30:26.974
A list of guests from your party
the other night would be helpful.

30:26.975 --> 30:29.654
My guests? Whatever for?

30:30.003 --> 30:31.334
Cos I'm asking.

30:32.603 --> 30:34.974
We'd also like the make
and model of their vehicles,

30:34.975 --> 30:36.974
together with registration numbers.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.974
Erm... D'you think perhaps you could
take Matthew and Flora for a walk?

30:40.975 --> 30:41.975
Yes.

30:41.976 --> 30:44.523
Go on. Go with Mrs Wingqvist.

30:47.975 --> 30:49.974
So, what is it?

30:50.603 --> 30:53.974
We've reason to believe someone
may have tampered with your vehicle,

30:53.975 --> 30:55.654
Mrs Humbolt.

30:55.655 --> 30:56.974
They think the crash that killed Adam

30:56.975 --> 30:59.243
and his girlfriend wasn't an accident.

31:00.548 --> 31:01.603
What?

31:02.643 --> 31:03.974
I don't believe it.

31:03.975 --> 31:06.974
Your husband says there's no-one
he can think of wishes him harm,

31:06.975 --> 31:09.974
so I'm afraid we must put
the same question to you.

31:09.975 --> 31:11.363
Well, no.

31:11.975 --> 31:14.243
The very thought of it, it's absurd.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.975
Well, that raises another matter.

31:19.175 --> 31:21.974
It means your vehicle
was most likely interfered with

31:21.975 --> 31:24.974
outside the Wingqvists',
while you were at this party.

31:25.403 --> 31:26.494
What of it?

31:26.495 --> 31:28.974
We've held off making it public,
but Christine Chase,

31:28.975 --> 31:32.974
Professor Drake's date, was already
dead when the car crashed.

31:33.163 --> 31:37.334
We'd assumed till now that Drake
had parked somewhere and killed her

31:37.335 --> 31:41.974
after leaving the party, but
if the brakes on the car were shot,

31:41.975 --> 31:44.974
she was already dead before she left
the Wingqvists'.

31:44.975 --> 31:47.174
I never heard anything more grotesque.

31:47.175 --> 31:49.974
It was an academics' wine and cheese,

31:49.975 --> 31:52.174
not The Masque Of The Red Death!

31:52.175 --> 31:53.974
Really, I think we'd've noticed

31:53.975 --> 31:55.974
if Adam had been carting
a dead girl around a party.

31:55.975 --> 31:57.707
Did you see them leave?

31:57.708 --> 32:01.403
Well, no. One minute they were
there, the next they were gone.

32:01.975 --> 32:05.974
Right. Well, whatever the case,
I'd advise you to take extra care

32:05.975 --> 32:07.974
when you're going about your business.

32:07.975 --> 32:11.975
If someone tried to cause you injury
and failed, they may well try again.

32:16.341 --> 32:17.723
Thank you.

32:18.628 --> 32:23.083
If only Luna could speak, she could
tell us what's happened to Barbara.

32:28.975 --> 32:31.974
What did that box of wires
and lights say?

32:31.975 --> 32:35.974
X-1 says if we can
beam our signal off the asteroid,

32:35.975 --> 32:38.507
we might be able to find
Barbara's homing beacon.

32:38.508 --> 32:39.975
Great Scott!

32:39.976 --> 32:45.974
It's a billion-to-one shot,
but it might just work!

32:45.975 --> 32:47.721
Christ, Marilyn! Watch what you're doing!

32:47.722 --> 32:49.974
- Sorry!
- What're you two playing at?

32:49.975 --> 32:51.654
Do you think this is easy?

32:51.655 --> 32:52.974
You come up here and have a go!

32:52.975 --> 32:53.975
All right.

32:54.335 --> 32:56.334
Take five, everyone.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.950
Listen, I know we're all on edge

32:59.975 --> 33:02.203
with what happened to Chrissie
and Adam...

33:04.843 --> 33:06.123
Speak for yourself.

33:07.975 --> 33:10.974
Ask me, it's good riddance
to the snotty bastard.

33:10.975 --> 33:12.974
Telling me my job!

33:12.975 --> 33:14.974
Bloody expert.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.974
Do you want to know
why we're this far behind schedule?

33:17.975 --> 33:18.975
Too many chiefs.

33:18.976 --> 33:20.974
Take after take.

33:20.975 --> 33:22.974
Yes, OK, maybe he went too far
sometimes, but...

33:22.975 --> 33:24.974
Sometimes? He made me feel this big.

33:24.975 --> 33:26.975
In front of the whole crew.
And you let him.

33:27.807 --> 33:29.540
Where was he when we did Bendy?

33:29.565 --> 33:30.647
All right!

33:30.672 --> 33:31.856
But Hilds has got a point.

33:32.363 --> 33:33.974
You know Marilyn is fond of Chrissie.

33:33.975 --> 33:35.654
If it's on her mind...

33:36.283 --> 33:41.443
Look, let's break for an early tea,
and just try to get this in the can.

33:49.975 --> 33:54.749
The worst thing
I've ever done? Life's too short.

33:54.774 --> 33:56.773
Guilt is for the religious.

33:56.798 --> 33:59.797
I just spoke to Natalie.
What did the police want?

33:59.975 --> 34:00.975
Larry?

34:00.976 --> 34:03.349
They think what happened to Adam
was meant for me.

34:03.350 --> 34:04.483
Do they?

34:04.484 --> 34:06.974
Someone did something to the car
intentionally.

34:06.975 --> 34:08.563
Someone wanted me dead.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.587
Christ, Elliot,
what have you got us into?

34:10.612 --> 34:12.610
Me? Don't put this on me.

34:12.975 --> 34:14.974
You knew full well.

34:14.975 --> 34:16.815
Ask your wife.

34:18.975 --> 34:21.974
List of people who attended
the Wingqvists' party.

34:21.975 --> 34:23.123
Get 'em logged in.

34:24.655 --> 34:26.975
Guv'nor's rated you exhibits officer.

34:28.402 --> 34:30.443
And if I were you, I'd keep my head down.

34:30.975 --> 34:32.974
You're not his blue-eyed boy right now.

34:32.975 --> 34:34.612
But she hasn't given
the registration numbers

34:34.612 --> 34:36.362
or details of any of her
guests' vehicles.

34:36.364 --> 34:37.483
Yeah, so?

34:37.976 --> 34:40.974
So, we've a set of car keys
found in Adam Drake's pocket

34:40.975 --> 34:42.813
and no idea whose car they belong to.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.174
Someone'll claim 'em
when they miss 'em, won't they?

34:45.175 --> 34:47.975
Anyway, you can give 'em
a ring round, can't you?

35:15.975 --> 35:16.975
Hello, sir.

35:16.976 --> 35:18.974
Detective Sergeant Morse, Thames Valley.

35:18.975 --> 35:21.974
I'd like to speak to somebody
about a Professor Adam Drake.

35:21.975 --> 35:25.115
I believe he was an attendee
at some course run here,

35:25.116 --> 35:26.163
Mr...?

35:26.668 --> 35:28.667
Gabriel Van Horne.

35:28.975 --> 35:31.174
What is it you do here, Mr Van Horne?

35:31.643 --> 35:33.523
We help people.

35:34.975 --> 35:36.974
Help them with what?

35:36.975 --> 35:38.495
Themselves, mostly.

35:45.638 --> 35:46.638
Hello?

35:48.975 --> 35:51.974
I'm sorry, you can't just
wander about the place!

35:51.975 --> 35:53.975
Hello?

35:59.975 --> 36:02.974
All right. All right, Harmony.

36:02.975 --> 36:04.975
Take it down to level two.

36:07.528 --> 36:09.527
Would you mind?

36:09.975 --> 36:10.975
Bring it down.

36:11.975 --> 36:13.975
Bring it down.

36:14.975 --> 36:16.694
What's all that about?

36:16.719 --> 36:18.558
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

36:18.583 --> 36:19.743
Shall we?

36:32.975 --> 36:34.174
What do you want?

36:34.175 --> 36:36.003
Straight answers, quickly given.

36:36.655 --> 36:38.654
I was speaking philosophically.

36:38.655 --> 36:39.974
At here at the Institute,

36:39.975 --> 36:42.974
we help people to see the world
as it really is.

36:42.975 --> 36:45.974
An individual
cannot realise their true potential

36:45.975 --> 36:48.974
while still adhering
to an illusory narrative.

36:48.975 --> 36:53.974
Now, as a-a policeman, you'll agree
that most social interactions

36:53.975 --> 36:54.975
are essentially dishonest.

36:54.976 --> 36:56.259
Yes.

36:56.260 --> 36:59.974
- Let us consider the cake paradox.
- Let's not.

36:59.975 --> 37:01.974
You asked what we do here.

37:01.975 --> 37:03.975
It may help you understand.

37:05.495 --> 37:06.974
You're having tea with a friend.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.657
Unlikely, but go on.

37:08.658 --> 37:12.974
There are two cakes left
on the plate, there's a large one

37:12.975 --> 37:17.443
of a kind you very much like, and
there's a smaller, dry looking one.

37:18.408 --> 37:20.567
Which one do you choose?

37:20.787 --> 37:22.943
The small one, but that's not the point.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.974
It's the whole point.

37:24.975 --> 37:27.815
You deny yourself to what end?

37:28.444 --> 37:30.975
We teach people to ask for
what they want.

37:31.975 --> 37:33.974
You teach people to be selfish?

37:33.975 --> 37:35.624
To be honest.

37:35.649 --> 37:37.648
To cast off regressive behaviours

37:37.975 --> 37:40.734
and harmful emotional patterns
imprinted since birth.

37:40.735 --> 37:41.975
Guilt.

37:42.456 --> 37:43.548
Shame.

37:43.549 --> 37:45.975
Is that what all the screaming
and crying was about?

37:46.841 --> 37:48.840
We call it catharsis therapy.

37:49.403 --> 37:52.014
And Adam Drake took your course,
is that right?

37:52.254 --> 37:54.214
He was undergoing treatment.

37:56.861 --> 38:00.083
What does it cost, this treatment?

38:01.594 --> 38:02.923
What price freedom?

38:23.975 --> 38:27.974
"But why, you may ask, should
anybody want to go to the Moon?

38:27.975 --> 38:29.974
"That I will tell you.

38:30.363 --> 38:34.654
"The reason is that behind the Moon
there lies the most wonderful,

38:34.655 --> 38:38.975
"beautiful, never-to-be-forgotten
garden the mind can think of."

38:39.975 --> 38:40.975
I never wanted any of it.

38:40.976 --> 38:43.974
What about me? What about what I wanted?

38:43.975 --> 38:46.974
What you wanted? When has it ever
been about any bloody thing else?

38:46.975 --> 38:49.974
- They're just playing a game.
- If you weren't such a wash-out!

38:49.975 --> 38:51.975
Come on. Snuggle down.

38:53.495 --> 38:54.974
Curtains open or closed?

38:54.975 --> 38:56.318
Open.

38:56.319 --> 38:58.174
Who was that?

38:58.603 --> 38:59.975
I don't know.

39:00.975 --> 39:02.495
Butterfly kisses?

39:06.441 --> 39:07.974
Good night.

39:07.975 --> 39:09.014
Sweet dreams.

39:09.403 --> 39:10.975
I love you.

39:13.847 --> 39:15.847
They won't leave us, will they?

40:21.183 --> 40:22.483
Don't mind me.

40:22.484 --> 40:25.182
I'm just keeping an eye on the shop,
ahead of Box.

40:25.183 --> 40:27.182
Mr Box, or the DCI.

40:27.183 --> 40:28.592
He's not turned in yet.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.939
We've left word.

40:29.940 --> 40:32.182
Well, I've got the ball rolling.

40:32.183 --> 40:34.183
Started taking particulars off the staff.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.182
Deceased is one Eric Charles Gidby.

40:38.183 --> 40:41.543
Yeah. It's all right, we know him.

40:42.409 --> 40:44.843
We had business here earlier
this week on another matter.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.182
Single shot to the head.

40:47.803 --> 40:51.182
Star-shaped contact burns
around the entry site.

40:51.183 --> 40:52.403
Suicide?

40:52.943 --> 40:54.942
Nothing to say otherwise.

40:54.967 --> 40:58.123
Some time between ten
and two o'clock last night.

40:59.183 --> 41:00.563
Who found the body?

41:01.422 --> 41:02.923
We wrapped at six.

41:03.543 --> 41:06.083
I left for home about seven.

41:06.549 --> 41:08.548
Did anyone have access to the building?

41:08.996 --> 41:11.195
Well, Hildy and me, of course -
but apart from that...

41:11.383 --> 41:13.283
Eric had his own set of keys.

41:13.903 --> 41:16.902
He often stayed on,
working on this or that bit of kit.

41:16.927 --> 41:19.927
We will need an account
from everyone as to their movements.

41:20.683 --> 41:22.682
Well, he's killed himself, hasn't he?

41:23.363 --> 41:25.940
You can't think anyone here
would have done anything to him!

41:25.941 --> 41:27.007
Jeff...

41:27.008 --> 41:30.182
Eric was my oldest friend.
We were in REME together.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.502
We have to be thorough, sir,

41:31.503 --> 41:33.763
for his sake as much as anybody else.

41:35.490 --> 41:38.194
I caught up on yesterday's rushes
till about eight,

41:38.219 --> 41:40.123
then went home and spent a quiet evening.

41:40.223 --> 41:42.382
Anyone vouch for you, sir?

41:42.383 --> 41:44.182
I live by myself.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.183
And your own movements, Miss Slayton?

41:47.849 --> 41:51.849
A solitary supper and then
I took Jacqueline Susann to bed.

41:54.302 --> 41:55.621
I see.

41:56.069 --> 41:58.893
And where might we reach Miss Susann?

41:58.918 --> 42:02.917
Oh, erm, I think Miss Slayton
is referring to a novel

42:02.942 --> 42:05.203
written by the popular authoress
of that name.

42:08.543 --> 42:12.182
How had Mr Gidby seemed lately
in himself?

42:12.183 --> 42:13.183
Better.

42:13.184 --> 42:16.183
I mean, since Marilyn,
he's a changed man.

42:17.183 --> 42:19.182
At least I thought he was.

42:19.183 --> 42:21.183
Better? How's that?

42:21.516 --> 42:24.683
Eric lost Patricia, his first wife,
three years ago.

42:25.183 --> 42:27.183
A hit and run in Wallingford.

42:28.183 --> 42:30.182
They were devoted to one another.

42:30.183 --> 42:32.182
He took it very badly.

42:32.843 --> 42:34.183
Go on, Hilds.

42:35.183 --> 42:36.523
It can't matter now.

42:38.683 --> 42:40.563
He'd tried before...

42:41.183 --> 42:42.473
to take his life.

42:42.474 --> 42:43.763
Pills and drink.

42:44.883 --> 42:46.882
Jeff found him.

42:47.183 --> 42:49.863
Got him in somewhere discreet.
Paid for it all.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.969
He'd've done the same for me.

42:54.956 --> 42:57.155
And did he keep a firearm, do you know?

42:57.180 --> 42:58.979
Well, I didn't give it much of a look,

42:59.004 --> 43:00.683
but I'd imagine it's one of ours.

43:00.863 --> 43:03.182
There's a few in the prop store
we've acquired over the years.

43:03.183 --> 43:07.182
Miniature weapons tend not to look
convincing in the puppets' hands.

43:07.183 --> 43:10.182
We'll usually shoot a live close-up
with somebody holding

43:10.183 --> 43:12.182
one of our pieces and cut that in.

43:12.183 --> 43:14.803
But we only keep blank ammunition here.

43:18.923 --> 43:20.922
- Mrs Gidby's arrived, sir.
- Right.

43:21.683 --> 43:25.723
About 8:30, he said he had something
to do and wouldn't be long.

43:26.976 --> 43:29.975
I didn't notice until I woke up
and realised he'd not been back.

43:30.363 --> 43:33.363
Did he say where he was going,
if he was meeting anyone?

43:34.183 --> 43:35.403
No.

43:35.849 --> 43:37.848
Was he much given to leaving you
alone of an evening

43:37.873 --> 43:39.873
without saying where he was going?

43:41.183 --> 43:43.182
When the black dog was on him.

43:43.183 --> 43:45.183
And when would be the last time?

43:48.183 --> 43:49.563
Wednesday night.

43:50.069 --> 43:51.529
After the Moon Launch.

43:52.703 --> 43:56.870
Eric had some business to talk
with Jeff about an upcoming episode,

43:56.871 --> 44:01.183
so Hildy, Miss Slayton, drove me home.

44:02.249 --> 44:03.568
How long had you been married?

44:03.942 --> 44:04.942
Two years.

44:05.723 --> 44:08.183
After his first wife died.

44:09.856 --> 44:13.895
We met at St Martin's, he was my tutor.

44:14.223 --> 44:17.283
All was well between you
and your husband, Mrs Gidby?

44:20.863 --> 44:23.023
He had his dark days.

44:24.556 --> 44:26.003
I loved him...

44:29.183 --> 44:32.283
...but it's not easy
stepping into a dead woman's shoes.

44:33.369 --> 44:36.689
I think if the police
had found who killed her...

44:37.609 --> 44:39.043
That's what he couldn't let go.

44:39.763 --> 44:41.182
How d'you mean?

44:41.183 --> 44:46.182
We would be out sometimes
and he'd see a car

44:46.183 --> 44:51.183
like the one that ran her
off the road, or think he had...

44:52.403 --> 44:56.542
He thought he saw it last week
at the studios

44:56.543 --> 44:58.703
and it sent him into a spin.

45:01.383 --> 45:03.183
Excuse me.

45:11.696 --> 45:13.695
I understand there's a dead body.

45:14.183 --> 45:16.182
We're just taking particulars, sir.

45:16.183 --> 45:17.183
Basic movements.

45:17.184 --> 45:19.182
The who, what, why, where and when of it.

45:19.183 --> 45:20.723
You're on light duties.

45:21.322 --> 45:22.923
I can lift a pencil.

45:25.856 --> 45:27.696
I thought we'd got things straight.

45:30.830 --> 45:32.598
It came in.

45:32.623 --> 45:35.693
Suspicious death on Banbury's
ground, but too big for 'em to deal.

45:35.718 --> 45:36.878
What was I supposed to do?

45:39.183 --> 45:40.183
Fetch me.

45:42.703 --> 45:44.183
I left word.

45:44.184 --> 45:46.182
You were in transit.

45:46.183 --> 45:47.323
Well, I'm here now.

45:48.596 --> 45:50.076
So you'd better talk me through it.

46:00.683 --> 46:02.182
Is this Gidby's?

46:02.183 --> 46:05.345
Been here overnight according to
the watchman who patrols the estate.

46:05.346 --> 46:09.003
Saw it on his rounds about eleven.
Took it someone was working late.

46:09.863 --> 46:11.083
Anything?

46:11.383 --> 46:14.163
Few little cigarillos
in the ashtray, but no note.

46:15.183 --> 46:17.182
Do you mind if I take a look?

46:17.183 --> 46:18.723
You're exhibits officer.

46:19.183 --> 46:21.182
It's an exhibit, isn't it?

46:21.183 --> 46:24.003
I don't need my work double
checking, thank you very much.

46:35.843 --> 46:37.553
You've settled back in all right, then?

46:37.554 --> 46:38.727
Oh, yeah.

46:38.728 --> 46:41.542
They've got me in a basement room.
There isn't even a window.

46:41.543 --> 46:44.182
You're in the game. That's what counts.

46:44.183 --> 46:45.183
Is it?

46:49.836 --> 46:52.243
God knows what
I'm going to do without him.

46:53.183 --> 46:56.563
We've been together
since Bendy, The Banana Boy.

46:57.183 --> 46:59.182
One of our early shows.

46:59.183 --> 47:00.765
Sappers together, weren't you?

47:00.766 --> 47:02.551
Oh, yes.

47:02.552 --> 47:05.703
Eric and me slung up bridges
from here to Timbuktu.

47:07.029 --> 47:08.843
He was a great engineer.

47:09.183 --> 47:11.182
Built all our models, you know?

47:11.183 --> 47:12.382
Is that right?

47:12.383 --> 47:14.182
Without his encouragement,

47:14.563 --> 47:16.763
I'd probably still be
a Punch and Judy man.

47:17.443 --> 47:19.737
It's how we started, me and Hildy.

47:19.738 --> 47:21.338
All over the South Coast.

47:21.339 --> 47:24.323
East Coast. Scotland. Wales. Isle of Man.

47:25.183 --> 47:28.183
Pair of us
in a clapped-out old Austin Seven.

47:29.383 --> 47:31.343
God knows how
she kept the old girl ticking over,

47:31.344 --> 47:33.243
but we never missed a booking.

47:34.463 --> 47:37.462
Digs when we were flush -
the beach when we weren't.

47:38.076 --> 47:40.075
Perhaps that's where
I should have stayed.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.299
That's the thing about television.

47:42.324 --> 47:43.555
What is?

47:43.580 --> 47:45.147
No live audience.

47:45.183 --> 47:48.183
No "oohs" or "aahs".

47:49.183 --> 47:51.182
That's what made it for me.

47:51.183 --> 47:53.183
That's the thing you can't replace.

47:54.183 --> 47:56.183
The looks on their faces.

47:58.183 --> 48:01.182
Right, Banbury can finish
up with statements and forensics.

48:01.183 --> 48:02.183
We're going back into town,

48:02.184 --> 48:04.291
see if we can keep this attempted
with Humbolt ticking over.

48:04.292 --> 48:06.430
Why... do you think
this is a coincidence?

48:06.431 --> 48:07.501
Don't you?

48:08.555 --> 48:10.946
Jeff Slayton's
personal assistant is murdered,

48:10.947 --> 48:13.614
his scientific advisor dies in a car
crash intended for someone else,

48:13.615 --> 48:15.848
and not 48 hours later
one of his puppeteers is found dead?

48:15.849 --> 48:19.182
- I would say they were connected.
- To your way of thinking, maybe.

48:19.183 --> 48:21.222
- It's suicide, isn't it?
- It's textbook.

48:21.223 --> 48:24.788
Maybe, but we should at least run
a gun residue test

48:24.789 --> 48:26.183
on the members of staff.

48:26.184 --> 48:27.805
Give the impression
we know what we're doing,

48:27.806 --> 48:29.726
- or that we give a damn.
- Morse...

48:29.727 --> 48:33.182
Oh, I get it. I wondered how long
you could keep it buttoned.

48:33.183 --> 48:34.921
Come to show us how it's done, have you?

48:34.922 --> 48:36.183
Say there is more to it.

48:36.184 --> 48:38.337
Nine times out of ten
these things are the spouse.

48:38.338 --> 48:39.782
This isn't robbery.

48:39.783 --> 48:42.859
You can't just find the first likely
prospect and fit them up for it.

48:42.860 --> 48:44.183
- No, no...
- Come again?

48:44.184 --> 48:46.182
You didn't mean that
how it came out, did you?

48:46.183 --> 48:48.223
He spoke out of turn. Heat of the moment.

48:52.183 --> 48:54.683
Fred, a word!

49:03.382 --> 49:05.203
Not lost the old charm, then.

49:06.856 --> 49:08.856
You'll never learn, will you?

49:10.042 --> 49:12.881
How's he seem? The old man.

49:12.906 --> 49:15.065
Working out all right under Box, is it?

49:15.090 --> 49:17.930
Well... ask him yourself.

49:20.783 --> 49:22.782
I tell you I ran into Joanie again?

49:23.023 --> 49:25.863
Up at the magistrates,
with some young arsonist.

49:28.183 --> 49:29.839
Well, boys will be boys.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.653
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

49:31.654 --> 49:33.183
But not in this case.

49:33.184 --> 49:34.455
Young girl.

49:34.456 --> 49:35.629
Teenager.

49:35.630 --> 49:37.183
Flora Humbolt.

49:38.289 --> 49:40.929
Aye-aye, look sharp. Here comes trouble.

49:42.183 --> 49:43.505
Sergeants.

49:43.506 --> 49:45.182
Miss Frazil.

49:45.183 --> 49:46.543
I'll, uh...

49:50.183 --> 49:51.356
So?

49:51.357 --> 49:52.744
What's the story?

49:52.745 --> 49:55.056
Well, there isn't one, yet.

49:55.057 --> 49:58.183
They don't roll you boys out
cos someone choked on a fishbone.

49:59.256 --> 50:02.055
Anything to do with the Adam Drake
car crash?

50:02.080 --> 50:03.080
They said you were on that.

50:03.184 --> 50:04.323
Did they?

50:04.524 --> 50:07.223
Maybe "they" should
keep their collective mouths shut.

50:07.742 --> 50:08.742
Drake was something to do

50:08.767 --> 50:11.765
with Slayton's latest marionette
extravaganza, wasn't he?

50:12.183 --> 50:14.618
It's under investigation,

50:14.619 --> 50:16.719
as a separate inquiry.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.145
For now.

50:18.146 --> 50:20.786
Any suspicious circumstances?

50:22.786 --> 50:24.785
Welcome home, by the way.

50:24.786 --> 50:25.985
Home?

50:25.986 --> 50:27.785
Back to town.

50:27.786 --> 50:28.985
Back to square one, more like.

50:29.483 --> 50:30.785
I'm living in a section house,

50:30.786 --> 50:33.305
working with people
who'd sooner I was somewhere else.

50:33.306 --> 50:35.305
It's like I'm going in circles.

50:35.306 --> 50:36.786
So why did you come back?

50:39.538 --> 50:43.786
All I hear, Jim Strange is poking
about this spate of heroin deaths.

50:44.698 --> 50:46.697
Eddie Nero's game, wasn't it?

50:47.243 --> 50:48.785
Nero's dead.

50:48.786 --> 50:50.785
George Fancy, too.

50:50.786 --> 50:53.786
I didn't know better,
I'd say you had unfinished business.

51:02.786 --> 51:05.785
What's the worst thing
you have ever done?

51:05.786 --> 51:07.581
The worst thing I've ever done?

51:07.606 --> 51:09.785
You're asking me that now?

51:09.786 --> 51:11.785
I'm not in the mood for this.

51:11.786 --> 51:13.785
You're not going to break through

51:13.786 --> 51:16.786
if you're not prepared to be
absolutely honest.

51:22.123 --> 51:24.785
Look, before you say anything,
just answer me this.

51:24.786 --> 51:27.216
What about the car keys
we found in Adam Drake's pocket?

51:27.217 --> 51:28.785
- What about 'em?
- Whose are they?

51:28.786 --> 51:31.145
Why has nobody come forward
to collect them?

51:31.146 --> 51:34.785
What if Eric Gidby's suicide
is actually something else?

51:34.786 --> 51:36.243
Like what?

51:36.786 --> 51:39.625
Like something which explains
what happened to Adam Drake

51:39.626 --> 51:42.752
and the person we all seem to have
forgotten about, Christine Chase.

51:42.753 --> 51:44.086
That's who it's about?

51:44.577 --> 51:46.623
- Who else?
- I don't know.

51:46.648 --> 51:49.785
Are you doing it for her, or
are you doing it for you?

51:50.363 --> 51:51.785
What does that mean?

51:51.786 --> 51:55.785
What you said to Box at the start
of all this about reputation.

51:55.786 --> 51:58.443
I'm just wondering
if you meant Drake's or yours.

51:59.786 --> 52:01.465
Is that what you think?

52:01.923 --> 52:03.785
I think you've been tucked
away in the bowels of the nick

52:03.786 --> 52:05.785
and maybe you're
looking to prove a point.

52:05.786 --> 52:10.785
The only thing that I'm trying
to prove is who's behind all this.

52:11.323 --> 52:13.785
Now, maybe that doesn't that
matter much to you any more,

52:13.786 --> 52:15.083
but it does still matter to me.

52:34.144 --> 52:36.063
- Miss Thursday.
- Morse!

52:37.144 --> 52:39.816
Jim Strange said he saw you at the
magistrate's with a Flora Humbolt.

52:39.817 --> 52:41.203
Criminal damage.

52:41.504 --> 52:42.723
That's right.

52:43.884 --> 52:45.083
What can you tell me about her?

52:45.344 --> 52:47.363
Er, well... nothing.

52:48.561 --> 52:50.143
You're asking me to discuss a client.

52:51.443 --> 52:54.343
I'm looking to find out about
her family situation.

52:54.344 --> 52:57.144
There is such a thing
as case confidentiality.

52:59.483 --> 53:00.683
Right.

53:02.144 --> 53:04.143
So, what's this?

53:04.563 --> 53:06.143
This is your latest, erm...

53:06.144 --> 53:08.143
- My latest what?
- Well, whatever it is.

53:08.144 --> 53:10.143
Project. Hobby.
Whatever you want to call it.

53:10.144 --> 53:12.541
I call it
working for the welfare department.

53:12.542 --> 53:15.503
Oh, and is that's what your
new look's about as well, is it?

53:15.504 --> 53:17.557
- It's very, erm...
- Very what?

53:17.558 --> 53:21.683
Very... "Soviet milk yields
are up this quarter, Comrade."

53:21.684 --> 53:23.144
Don't take the piss.

53:23.145 --> 53:24.663
No. It's very...

53:24.664 --> 53:25.603
Doctor Zhivago.

53:25.604 --> 53:27.343
You look like the girl
from Doctor Zhivago.

53:27.344 --> 53:29.183
- Julie Christie.
- No. The other one.

53:29.184 --> 53:32.143
Her daughter. With the - "Then
it's a gift", the balalaika.

53:32.144 --> 53:34.143
You know, you can be
a real prick sometimes.

53:34.144 --> 53:35.691
Oh. Nice language.

53:35.692 --> 53:36.876
Thank you, Emily Dickinson.

53:36.877 --> 53:38.144
Oh, there we go again.

53:38.145 --> 53:40.143
I know you're smart.
We all know you're smart.

53:40.144 --> 53:41.824
You don't have to prove it all the time.

53:41.825 --> 53:42.765
Take a day off.

53:42.766 --> 53:44.723
Well, thank you very much for your help.

53:49.790 --> 53:50.883
Boyfriend?

53:51.654 --> 53:53.363
Another one of Dad's.

53:53.896 --> 53:55.416
Doesn't look much like a copper.

53:56.750 --> 53:57.750
No.

54:12.410 --> 54:15.730
You, er, giving the canteen
a rest today, sir?

54:16.897 --> 54:18.203
I was just...

54:19.144 --> 54:20.430
Extraordinary thing.

54:20.431 --> 54:22.123
Yes, it is, isn't it?

54:24.777 --> 54:26.457
Hell of a thing.

54:28.644 --> 54:30.964
Brave as you like.

54:37.144 --> 54:41.143
I was a boy when Alcock
and Brown crossed the Atlantic.

54:41.144 --> 54:43.183
Everybody said that couldn't be done.

54:43.184 --> 54:45.459
50 years on, it's the moon.

54:45.460 --> 54:48.144
Man's reach, Thursday.

54:50.950 --> 54:52.630
All's well, sir?

54:54.144 --> 54:57.143
A sobering thing to discover

54:57.144 --> 55:00.143
so late in life
that one is considered a fool.

55:00.144 --> 55:01.601
Not you, sir.

55:01.602 --> 55:03.663
Yes, I'm under no illusion.

55:03.664 --> 55:06.731
I'm a figure of ridicule
to be openly mocked and scorned.

55:06.732 --> 55:10.143
This Pelican is
an albatross around my neck.

55:10.144 --> 55:11.564
Someone even mentioned it to Mrs Bright

55:11.565 --> 55:13.344
at Canasta the other evening.

55:14.243 --> 55:17.723
People laugh at me behind my back,
and even to my face.

55:20.144 --> 55:26.143
It seems to me we're in the business
of keeping the Queen's peace

55:26.144 --> 55:28.144
and preserving life and limb.

55:29.910 --> 55:31.376
This campaign of yours -

55:31.401 --> 55:34.491
you'll probably never know
how many lives you've saved.

55:34.516 --> 55:38.923
Hundreds. Thousands, maybe,
by the time it's done.

55:44.144 --> 55:46.283
I've always been able to rely on you.

55:50.144 --> 55:54.984
Well, I must meet a representation
from the Oxford traders.

55:57.144 --> 55:59.883
Up in arms about parking restrictions.

56:30.144 --> 56:31.144
Look at me!

56:32.740 --> 56:34.739
I can bounce really high.

56:34.740 --> 56:37.739
Do you think I can bounce
as high as the moon?

56:37.740 --> 56:38.990
Hello.

56:38.991 --> 56:41.739
Hello! Hello.

56:41.740 --> 56:43.579
You're the policeman.

56:43.580 --> 56:44.739
From the other day.

56:44.740 --> 56:45.740
Yes, that's right. Morse.

56:45.741 --> 56:47.384
My parents are out.

56:47.385 --> 56:50.923
Oh, well, actually, Miss Humbolt,
it was you I came to see.

56:51.740 --> 56:52.740
Is it about Court?

56:52.741 --> 56:54.739
- What I did?
- No. No, no.

56:54.740 --> 56:56.140
I just wondered to ask you

56:56.141 --> 56:59.259
if your father had ever mentioned
Heaviside Studios?

56:59.523 --> 57:00.739
Where they make the puppet films?

57:00.740 --> 57:02.099
That's right.

57:02.100 --> 57:03.739
Adam invited us there.

57:03.740 --> 57:05.163
Last half term.

57:05.740 --> 57:06.779
Adam Drake?

57:07.403 --> 57:08.739
Me and Matthew.

57:09.123 --> 57:10.739
We could've perfectly taken the bus,

57:10.740 --> 57:14.579
but Mother insisted on driving us
there, of course.

57:14.580 --> 57:15.739
Why "of course"?

57:15.740 --> 57:17.739
Because it's her all over.

57:17.740 --> 57:19.739
Anything to do with the television.

57:19.740 --> 57:21.323
Star-struck.

57:21.740 --> 57:23.739
Whenever Adam was on,
we'd have to watch it.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.923
She'd tell everyone
Daddy had been his tutor.

57:27.740 --> 57:29.739
Well, what did you make of it?

57:29.740 --> 57:32.739
It's a bit young for me,
but Matthew's mad on all of that.

57:33.203 --> 57:35.203
And everyone was very nice.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.739
A lady gave him some of the toys,

57:37.740 --> 57:39.739
because Adam's quite important there.

57:40.363 --> 57:42.740
I mean, he was.

57:44.203 --> 57:45.579
Did you see much of him?

57:45.580 --> 57:46.739
Adam?

57:47.243 --> 57:48.739
He'd be at the house sometimes.

57:48.740 --> 57:52.739
"Un ami de la maison,"
I think that's the phrase.

57:53.203 --> 57:55.259
It's what Mother called him, anyway.

57:55.260 --> 57:56.923
And did you like him?

57:57.740 --> 57:59.739
No? Why?

57:59.740 --> 58:00.939
I don't know.

58:00.940 --> 58:04.099
You just get that feeling sometimes,
don't you?

58:04.403 --> 58:06.243
I don't think he was a kind person.

58:08.473 --> 58:09.473
Right.

58:09.498 --> 58:11.043
You're taking your life, aren't you?

58:11.740 --> 58:14.579
Interviewing a child who's
got nothing to do with the case

58:14.580 --> 58:16.739
goes a bit beyond the remit
of an exhibits officer.

58:16.740 --> 58:18.001
I was curious.

58:18.002 --> 58:21.803
You'll be curious when the DCI
has your guts. Oh, bugger!

58:22.580 --> 58:24.739
Bloody carpet tiles!

58:24.740 --> 58:27.939
Every time I touch the door handle
or press for the lift.

58:27.940 --> 58:30.163
What's wrong with lino?

58:31.100 --> 58:32.419
It's how things are.

58:32.420 --> 58:33.739
Funny.

58:33.740 --> 58:35.739
There's a compere spot
going down the Legion,

58:35.740 --> 58:36.843
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

58:38.740 --> 58:40.244
I had a word with the guv'nor

58:40.245 --> 58:42.739
about running a paraffin test
on the staff

58:42.740 --> 58:46.252
just to be on the safe side.
Strange has drawn the short straw.

58:46.253 --> 58:48.402
All staff in the studio's
handle the guns.

58:48.403 --> 58:50.739
Decent cover for someone with a motive.

58:50.740 --> 58:52.271
The wife, maybe?

58:52.272 --> 58:53.739
If she was planning
on killing her husband.

58:53.740 --> 58:56.739
But what that's got to do
with nobbling Humbolt's car...?

58:56.740 --> 58:59.739
Mrs Humbolt drove the children
to the studio during half term

58:59.740 --> 59:01.276
on Professor Drake's invitation.

59:02.123 --> 59:03.739
He was a Punch and Judy man.

59:03.740 --> 59:04.843
Who?

59:05.740 --> 59:08.283
Slayton. Where he started out.

59:08.763 --> 59:10.597
I used to like the Punch and Judy.

59:10.598 --> 59:13.203
Clacton Bank Holiday
with Charlie and Billy.

59:13.740 --> 59:16.739
Call them professors, don't they?
The blokes that do the act?

59:16.740 --> 59:18.123
Yes. Yes, I believe so.

59:20.527 --> 59:22.526
Maybe the DCI's right.

59:22.551 --> 59:25.123
Just a coincidence that Drake links them.

59:28.420 --> 59:29.739
I can't do these things.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.259
Can you do these things?

59:31.260 --> 59:32.739
I could work the ones in my old office.

59:32.740 --> 59:34.043
I know.

59:35.740 --> 59:37.739
Sod it! I'm going home.

59:37.740 --> 59:39.739
Let me take you.

59:39.740 --> 59:42.083
No, you're all right.
I'm not much company.

59:43.740 --> 59:45.739
You mind your step.

59:45.740 --> 59:49.739
You've had a bit of luck getting
back into CID, but luck can turn.

59:49.740 --> 59:51.203
Trust me.

59:57.740 --> 59:58.740
Come in.

59:59.115 --> 01:00:00.363
Hello, sir.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.740
Morse.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.740
I'm not keeping you, am I?

01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:04.739
No! No.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.739
Just going through the quarterly
figures for fixed penalty offences

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.179
ahead of a pow-wow with ACC Bottoms
tomorrow at Division.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.224
But no, please, come in.
What can I do for you?

01:00:15.225 --> 01:00:17.739
Well, I'm looking to locate
any information Traffic may have

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.099
on a fatal road accident in
Wallingford about three years ago.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.178
Lady's name was Patricia Gidby.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:26.739
It was a hit and run, unsolved.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.739
Well, that would have
fallen under Berkshire, of course,

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.739
before the merger. Gidby, you say?

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.203
That's right, sir. Patricia.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.739
Something to do with the Drake inquiry?

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.739
Possibly, sir.

01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:39.739
Very well.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.130
There we are. See what we can do.

01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:43.363
Thank you, sir.

01:00:43.364 --> 01:00:47.923
You, erm... You're settling in
all right, are you?

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:57.123
Things are not what they were,
for any of us.

01:01:01.763 --> 01:01:03.144
Perhaps at the time

01:01:03.145 --> 01:01:06.203
when one doesn't always appreciate
one's good fortune,

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:10.739
but I'm sure Inspector Thursday will
be very pleased to have you back.

01:01:11.243 --> 01:01:15.739
As indeed, albeit at one remove, am I.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740
Well...

01:01:17.094 --> 01:01:19.093
Well, thank you, sir.

01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:31.403
I can't help you if you're not
prepared to be completely honest.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.740
Tell the truth and shame the devil.

01:02:36.567 --> 01:02:39.567
And you drive the vehicle
AC-four-two-seven, is that right?

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.483
And the registration is?

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.740
Right.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.740
Thank you.

01:02:49.723 --> 01:02:52.739
Aye-aye, matey. So this is where
they've got you, is it?

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.739
Be it ever so humble.

01:02:55.323 --> 01:02:56.739
Results from the swab tests.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.739
Thought I'd run 'em by you
before the upstairs.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.251
You being exhibits officer and all.

01:03:02.252 --> 01:03:03.739
Anything?

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.739
Four of 'em tested positive
for having fired a weapon

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.333
in the last few days.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.739
Slayton, his sister,
and both Mr and Mrs Gidby.

01:03:11.243 --> 01:03:12.603
Right.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.740
What's this I hear about heroin deaths?

01:03:24.363 --> 01:03:25.740
Where d'you hear that?

01:03:26.963 --> 01:03:28.740
Around.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.779
Just something I'm looking into

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.963
for the Forward Planning
Steering Committee.

01:03:34.307 --> 01:03:35.626
Sort of roving brief.

01:03:36.071 --> 01:03:37.390
Budgetary.

01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:39.739
Allocation of resources
between departments.

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.940
Right, well...

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.083
That's a nasty business, drugs.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.363
Dangerous, too.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.083
As George Fancy found to his cost.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.939
I hope you're a more convincing liar
when it matters.

01:03:55.587 --> 01:03:57.387
Your life may depend on it.

01:03:59.846 --> 01:04:01.646
I'll be seeing you.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.739
Matthew says a policeman came round.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740
Yes.

01:04:21.923 --> 01:04:23.740
What did he want?

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.739
Flora?

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.740
He just wanted to talk.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.043
About what?

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.579
Nothing much.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.740
This and that.

01:04:39.566 --> 01:04:41.246
What did you tell him?

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.443
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

01:05:24.498 --> 01:05:27.977
Oh. Mrs Trellis. DS Morse, Thames Valley.

01:05:27.978 --> 01:05:29.017
I was here the other day.

01:05:29.018 --> 01:05:31.497
Aye, I remember you. She's not in.

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.163
Right.

01:05:33.978 --> 01:05:36.203
Do they just have the one car?

01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:39.178
Yes. She can't drive.

01:05:40.338 --> 01:05:41.977
Have you been with them long?

01:05:41.978 --> 01:05:43.576
Couple of years.

01:05:43.577 --> 01:05:44.978
Nice to work for?

01:05:44.979 --> 01:05:46.977
It's not my place to say.

01:05:47.923 --> 01:05:49.123
But if it were?

01:05:51.777 --> 01:05:55.777
If I wasn't Bible-raised, I might
lay my tongue to all sorts for her.

01:05:58.231 --> 01:05:59.243
And him?

01:06:00.411 --> 01:06:01.763
A right Hosea.

01:06:04.864 --> 01:06:07.544
- Do they have a gardener?
- Oh, yes.

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:11.596
Had he just been,
the last time we came by?

01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:13.780
It's just that there was a bonfire
at the bottom of the garden

01:06:13.805 --> 01:06:16.083
and I'm curious what they could have
been burning at this time of year.

01:06:36.498 --> 01:06:38.523
It's the handle of a handbag or purse.

01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:40.724
I'm curious as to how it
ended up on a bonfire.

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:46.017
I found a bag the morning after.

01:06:46.363 --> 01:06:48.657
I knew it wasn't Mrs Wingqvist's.

01:06:48.658 --> 01:06:50.043
Too young for her.

01:06:50.978 --> 01:06:52.978
She said it
belonged to one of the guests.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.643
Where did you find it?

01:06:56.018 --> 01:06:58.977
Under one of the beds. Upstairs.

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.018
You find all sorts.

01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:04.770
Quite a tidying job, I expect.

01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:06.443
Usually.

01:07:06.978 --> 01:07:07.978
But not this time?

01:07:08.363 --> 01:07:09.603
No.

01:07:09.978 --> 01:07:13.731
It's usually like the Last Days
Of Sodom after one of their do's,

01:07:13.756 --> 01:07:15.977
but I came around Thursday morning

01:07:15.978 --> 01:07:19.018
and there wasn't a stick out of place.

01:07:21.978 --> 01:07:23.977
And are they much given to parties?

01:07:23.978 --> 01:07:25.726
Every third Wednesday.

01:07:25.727 --> 01:07:27.978
Rain or shine.

01:07:42.178 --> 01:07:44.497
Those have been there
since after the party.

01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:45.978
No-one's claimed them.

01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:03.616
Why would Christine Chase
leave her bag behind?

01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:06.640
I don't think she did.
Not voluntarily, at least.

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:09.664
If something happened to her at
the party, someone would have known.

01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:10.978
Well, what if they all knew?

01:08:11.563 --> 01:08:12.977
But didn't say anything for fear
of the damage

01:08:12.978 --> 01:08:14.616
it would do to their reputations?

01:08:14.617 --> 01:08:18.977
I've checked the list of guests -
seven couples, seven cars.

01:08:18.978 --> 01:08:21.977
None of which corresponds to the
keys we found in Drake's pocket.

01:08:21.978 --> 01:08:23.497
There was another car.

01:08:24.764 --> 01:08:26.002
So...

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:30.162
who's Mrs Wingqvist keeping quiet about?

01:08:30.783 --> 01:08:31.783
'I never wanted it.'

01:08:32.443 --> 01:08:34.978
To be frank, it turned my stomach.

01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:38.884
You see, I love my wife.

01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:40.765
She's enough for me.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:42.790
All I've ever wanted.

01:08:44.178 --> 01:08:46.178
It was Natalie put the idea in her head.

01:08:48.363 --> 01:08:49.977
Isobel was bored.

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:52.978
It's no big deal. Everyone's doing it.

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:55.978
It's honest, unlike an affair.

01:08:59.658 --> 01:09:02.483
Love your earrings.

01:09:02.777 --> 01:09:03.817
Are they Biba?

01:09:12.978 --> 01:09:14.624
Just, erm...

01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.178
let it all hang out.

01:09:19.978 --> 01:09:22.714
Christine Chase thought
she was coming to your house

01:09:22.715 --> 01:09:23.978
on a date with Adam Drake,

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:27.818
but, of course, that's not what was
going on at all, was it?

01:09:28.978 --> 01:09:30.603
There's no law against it.

01:09:30.737 --> 01:09:32.737
Why did you burn
Christine Chase's handbag?

01:09:35.363 --> 01:09:36.977
Did something happen at your party

01:09:36.978 --> 01:09:38.977
that you couldn't afford
anyone to know about?

01:09:39.563 --> 01:09:40.977
I don't know what you mean.

01:09:40.978 --> 01:09:44.225
Adam Drake didn't leave
your house in his own car,

01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:46.286
not because there
was anything wrong with it,

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:49.042
but because he couldn't find his keys.

01:09:50.203 --> 01:09:53.017
I think they couldn't be found
because someone else had 'em.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.963
Who took Adam's keys from the fruit bowl?

01:09:56.684 --> 01:09:58.683
Is it the one person
you've left off the list?

01:09:59.643 --> 01:10:02.483
'We'd taken the children
over to Christchurch Meadows.'

01:10:02.978 --> 01:10:05.497
I was pointing out
the constellations to the kids,

01:10:05.498 --> 01:10:07.978
the same way my father
had got me interested.

01:10:08.978 --> 01:10:10.977
This perfect cloudless night.

01:10:10.978 --> 01:10:13.977
That's when Isobel first broached it,

01:10:14.563 --> 01:10:17.337
said it might put something back
into the marriage,

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.978
something modern.

01:10:21.657 --> 01:10:24.123
I was afraid to lose her,
so I went along with it.

01:10:24.978 --> 01:10:26.497
But Adam...

01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:28.977
my former student, for God's sake!

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:32.977
If it had just been the physical,
I might have worn it,

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:33.978
but...

01:10:34.978 --> 01:10:38.323
...Isobel became obsessed with him.

01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:41.670
It was love! Fulfilment.

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:44.894
Do you think for a moment
I could have hurt Adam?

01:10:45.178 --> 01:10:46.977
I was going to leave Larry for him.

01:10:46.978 --> 01:10:49.017
We were going to go away together.

01:10:49.018 --> 01:10:51.623
And was Drake serious about her?

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.647
Who knew with Adam?

01:10:53.978 --> 01:10:55.977
He expected her to leave Larry.

01:10:55.978 --> 01:10:57.977
He'd lately got rid of the woman
he was involved with

01:10:57.978 --> 01:10:59.288
and he wanted her to follow suit.

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.495
Who was that?

01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:01.978
I don't know.

01:11:01.979 --> 01:11:04.977
Whoever she was, it was just
a bit of sport, Adam said.

01:11:04.978 --> 01:11:06.530
But she'd been playing up.

01:11:06.531 --> 01:11:08.530
The girl I was with...

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:10.144
I couldn't go through with it.

01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:11.977
We were in the garden, then she left.

01:11:11.978 --> 01:11:14.243
I had a swim, tried to clear my head.

01:11:16.818 --> 01:11:18.591
I didn't do anything to Christine.

01:11:18.616 --> 01:11:19.842
Well, somebody did.

01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:22.563
Whose keys did Drake take?

01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:25.978
Who are you all trying to protect?

01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:40.977
All right, Mr Van Horne.

01:11:40.978 --> 01:11:43.977
Perhaps you'd like to explain
how Adam Drake came to be found

01:11:43.978 --> 01:11:46.978
with your car keys on his body.

01:11:48.923 --> 01:11:51.657
We've spoken to the Wingqvists
and the Humbolts.

01:11:51.658 --> 01:11:55.977
We know you attended a party there
on Wednesday night.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:59.044
What happened with Christine Chase?
Did she change her mind?

01:11:59.045 --> 01:12:01.443
And who said I was with her?

01:12:08.978 --> 01:12:12.163
You picked out Adam Drake's car keys.

01:12:14.178 --> 01:12:16.977
According to the rules of the house
that means you're entitled

01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:19.978
to sleep with whatever girl he'd
brought with him.

01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:27.977
She said she was feeling a bit woozy,

01:12:27.978 --> 01:12:30.978
went off for a drink of water
and when she didn't come back...

01:12:32.317 --> 01:12:33.797
...I went looking for her.

01:12:39.978 --> 01:12:41.017
'She must have hit her head.'

01:12:42.203 --> 01:12:43.978
'Nobody heard anything?'

01:12:45.978 --> 01:12:47.977
I suppose they were all...

01:12:47.978 --> 01:12:49.977
Otherwise engaged.

01:12:49.978 --> 01:12:51.977
So why didn't you call an ambulance?

01:12:51.978 --> 01:12:53.363
She was dead.

01:12:55.443 --> 01:12:56.977
There was nothing anyone could have done.

01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:59.977
So you scarpered and left everyone
else to clear up your mess.

01:12:59.978 --> 01:13:02.977
She was Adam's date. Hm-mm?

01:13:03.643 --> 01:13:04.977
So I called a cab.

01:13:04.978 --> 01:13:06.582
Because you didn't want to explain

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.482
why you were leaving in such
a hurry, and unluckily for you,

01:13:09.483 --> 01:13:11.337
Drake had pulled your keys
from the fruit bowl.

01:13:11.843 --> 01:13:14.434
Right, Mr Van Horne, we will
continue this down the station.

01:13:14.435 --> 01:13:15.627
Get your coat.

01:13:15.628 --> 01:13:17.977
Well, somebody has been busy.

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:20.423
Bit beyond the call
for an exhibits officer.

01:13:20.424 --> 01:13:22.603
This it, or you got any more
little surprises for me?

01:13:22.604 --> 01:13:24.370
Just using his initiative, sir.

01:13:24.371 --> 01:13:25.978
So, she dies in a fall,

01:13:26.643 --> 01:13:28.630
and Van Horne leaves the mess
for them to sort out.

01:13:28.631 --> 01:13:32.330
They're in so deep with his Single
Way mumbo-jumbo they cover it up.

01:13:32.331 --> 01:13:33.978
Must be more to it than that.

01:13:33.979 --> 01:13:35.766
Van Horne's got something on them.

01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:37.512
Not necessarily.

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.977
"Girl dies in Oxford orgy."

01:13:39.978 --> 01:13:41.977
Hard for reputations to survive
that kind of headline,

01:13:41.978 --> 01:13:43.977
let alone academic careers.

01:13:43.978 --> 01:13:44.978
So where are they?

01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:46.977
The Humbolts and the Wingqvists
have been bailed.

01:13:46.978 --> 01:13:49.177
What was Drake meant to do
with Christine Chase's body?

01:13:49.178 --> 01:13:51.977
Take her back to her flat
and leave her there.

01:13:51.978 --> 01:13:53.977
Except Van Horne's
gone off with Drake's car keys,

01:13:53.978 --> 01:13:55.583
which means he has to
borrow Humbolt's car.

01:13:55.608 --> 01:13:56.817
Hm-mm.

01:13:56.818 --> 01:13:58.698
Then who fixed the brakes?

01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:01.657
Just in from the information room,
sir. Young girl's gone missing.

01:14:01.658 --> 01:14:03.497
Flora Humbolt.

01:14:03.498 --> 01:14:06.657
Little brother's gone, too.
Looks like she's taken him with her.

01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:08.337
"Please don't try and find us.

01:14:08.338 --> 01:14:10.978
"You won't have to worry about us
any more."

01:14:12.978 --> 01:14:15.656
She wouldn't do anything, would she,
to herself or the boy?

01:14:15.657 --> 01:14:16.978
She wouldn't hurt Matthew.

01:14:16.979 --> 01:14:18.648
What would you know?

01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:20.977
We have talked to her, Mrs Humbolt,
at some length.

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:23.177
Talked to her!

01:14:23.178 --> 01:14:24.615
You wanna try living with her!

01:14:24.616 --> 01:14:25.978
You've no idea!

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:27.977
I'm her mother. She's not stable.

01:14:27.978 --> 01:14:30.657
I'd have to concur
with welfare, Mrs Humbolt.

01:14:30.658 --> 01:14:32.618
When I saw Flora yesterday
she seemed perfectly fine.

01:14:32.619 --> 01:14:34.392
Oh, yes.

01:14:34.393 --> 01:14:36.497
You're probably what's caused this.

01:14:36.498 --> 01:14:37.977
The police!

01:14:37.978 --> 01:14:40.017
All right, Mrs Humbolt, I think what
we need to do

01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:43.043
is have a list of
the places that she used to go to...

01:14:53.298 --> 01:14:55.298
Is this why you came asking after her?

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:59.116
Well, sometimes you've got to throw
a stone into the pool,

01:14:59.141 --> 01:15:00.423
stir the silt.

01:15:00.448 --> 01:15:02.763
And... And never mind who gets hurt?

01:15:02.978 --> 01:15:04.513
They're children. If something happens...

01:15:04.514 --> 01:15:06.483
They've not been taken by anyone.

01:15:06.978 --> 01:15:08.977
They're not in any danger.

01:15:09.523 --> 01:15:11.977
It's not the first time
a child has run away from home.

01:15:11.978 --> 01:15:14.978
We'll circulate some photographs
and a description.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.338
They can't have got far.

01:15:18.978 --> 01:15:20.123
We will find them.

01:15:21.658 --> 01:15:22.978
You'd better.

01:15:31.123 --> 01:15:34.122
'Thames Valley Constabulary
has asked the public

01:15:34.123 --> 01:15:36.802
'to be on the lookout for two
children missing in the Oxford area.

01:15:36.803 --> 01:15:38.962
'Flora and...'

01:15:39.563 --> 01:15:42.122
I've just got off the phone.

01:15:42.123 --> 01:15:44.643
With what happened to Eric...

01:15:46.603 --> 01:15:48.123
...Dinky's on a knife edge.

01:15:49.683 --> 01:15:51.550
If they pull
out of the licensing deal...?

01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.122
I'm going home.

01:15:53.123 --> 01:15:54.283
Can you close up?

01:17:04.283 --> 01:17:07.573
Well, the map book in Eric Gidby's
car was open to Edenbury.

01:17:07.574 --> 01:17:11.122
There's oil on the page
and on a torch in the door.

01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:14.122
There's a toolbox in the boot and
a jam jar filled with brake fluid.

01:17:14.123 --> 01:17:16.011
You think he interfered
with Humbolt's motor?

01:17:16.012 --> 01:17:17.122
He'd've had the know how.

01:17:17.123 --> 01:17:18.123
But not the motive.

01:17:18.124 --> 01:17:20.122
Well, Eric Gidby's first wife Patricia

01:17:20.123 --> 01:17:21.581
was killed in a hit and run.

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:22.568
So?

01:17:22.569 --> 01:17:26.692
So Larry Humbolt's car, the car
that Adam Drake was driving,

01:17:26.693 --> 01:17:28.592
is an exact match, make and model,

01:17:28.593 --> 01:17:30.582
and it's the only one of its kind
in Oxfordshire.

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:33.482
The registered owner of the vehicle
at the time of his wife's accident

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:34.962
was indeed Larry Humbolt.

01:17:34.963 --> 01:17:37.387
I thought Humbolt
had only had the car a year.

01:17:37.388 --> 01:17:40.357
He has. But Humbolt's car's
a cut and shut,

01:17:40.358 --> 01:17:42.592
which is two cars welded together.

01:17:42.593 --> 01:17:45.960
The back end of the vehicle is
the car that killed Patricia Gidby.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.122
I think the dealers offered to file
the change of ownership,

01:17:48.123 --> 01:17:50.122
but did so fraudulently, making it look

01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:53.122
as if Larry Humbolt had always
been the owner of that vehicle.

01:17:53.123 --> 01:17:56.122
It was the previous owner of the
vehicle that killed Gidby's wife.

01:17:56.123 --> 01:17:58.187
How would he know what car Humbolt owned?

01:17:58.188 --> 01:18:00.820
Because Adam Drake invited
the Humbolt children to the studio,

01:18:00.821 --> 01:18:02.500
and their mother drove them there.

01:18:02.501 --> 01:18:05.122
Gidby cut the brakes in revenge
for his wife's death

01:18:05.123 --> 01:18:06.826
- and then killed himself.
- Who owned the car

01:18:06.851 --> 01:18:08.211
at the time of the accident?

01:18:08.969 --> 01:18:11.768
Er, well, unknown
associate of Eddie Nero.

01:18:11.793 --> 01:18:12.953
Address in South Oxford.

01:18:14.643 --> 01:18:17.683
Great, I'll let the ACC know
I've cracked it.

01:18:18.963 --> 01:18:21.642
Me and Alan'll pick him up.
Put Van Horne to bed.

01:18:21.643 --> 01:18:23.760
Get anything over there
into evidence. Fred...

01:18:23.761 --> 01:18:25.162
I know, light duties.

01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:27.122
No. Talk to Dr Humbolt.

01:18:27.123 --> 01:18:29.123
I want chapter
and verse on who filed the reg.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.683
They also serve.

01:18:34.763 --> 01:18:36.683
How things are.

01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:06.758
- Did you see them leave?
- Well, no, we didn't.

01:19:06.759 --> 01:19:09.123
One minute they were there,
and the next they were gone.

01:19:46.963 --> 01:19:49.122
- Well, I've told her.
- And?

01:19:49.123 --> 01:19:50.123
Made a scene.

01:19:50.124 --> 01:19:52.122
It's not like she can do
anything about it.

01:19:52.123 --> 01:19:54.122
I don't know so much.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.122
I wouldn't put anything past that one.

01:19:56.123 --> 01:19:57.123
Hell hath no fury.

01:20:12.803 --> 01:20:14.809
Afternoon, Dr Humbolt.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.786
One or two questions
about the purchase of your car.

01:20:17.787 --> 01:20:20.592
Sorry. I've just got back
from the solicitors.

01:20:20.593 --> 01:20:22.529
I thought you were Isobel with the kids.

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.122
- How's that, sir?
- Isobel left a note.

01:20:25.763 --> 01:20:27.557
You called, didn't you?

01:20:28.443 --> 01:20:30.476
The police called about ten minutes ago

01:20:30.477 --> 01:20:34.122
and said they'd been found.
She went to collect them.

01:20:34.123 --> 01:20:35.123
From where?

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:37.498
I got it wrong.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:39.802
It wasn't Eric Gidby who drained
the brakes on Humbolt's car.

01:20:39.803 --> 01:20:41.122
Somebody's trying to frame him.

01:20:41.123 --> 01:20:44.003
But Isobel Humbolt's on her way
to Heaviside now.

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:48.123
Hello?

01:20:49.123 --> 01:20:50.482
Hello.

01:20:50.963 --> 01:20:52.498
- Mrs Humbolt.
- Oh!

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:56.715
We met when you brought
your children here at half term.

01:20:56.716 --> 01:20:57.962
Where are they?

01:20:58.843 --> 01:21:01.122
Why in God's name
would the police bring them here?

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:03.122
Oh, I'm quite sure they wouldn't.

01:21:03.123 --> 01:21:04.123
But they telephoned me.

01:21:04.124 --> 01:21:05.802
No, that was me, Mrs Humbolt.

01:21:06.843 --> 01:21:09.122
May I call you Isobel?

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:11.122
I feel as if I know you.

01:21:12.163 --> 01:21:13.483
Hildegard Slayton.

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:16.122
Hildy?

01:21:16.963 --> 01:21:18.122
Perhaps he mentioned me.

01:21:18.523 --> 01:21:19.642
Who mentioned you?

01:21:19.643 --> 01:21:21.510
- Adam.
- What?

01:21:21.511 --> 01:21:23.626
I didn't mind about Christine
and the other young ones.

01:21:23.627 --> 01:21:27.123
Well, of course, I minded,
but I knew they were just nothing.

01:21:28.123 --> 01:21:30.962
But you...? You were different.

01:21:31.443 --> 01:21:32.642
I don't understand.

01:21:33.003 --> 01:21:34.642
I'm the other woman.

01:21:35.363 --> 01:21:37.642
The other other woman.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:41.122
The one that meant something to him
until you came along.

01:21:41.603 --> 01:21:43.122
You're who he left?

01:21:43.843 --> 01:21:45.482
He would never say who it was.

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:47.122
Really?

01:21:47.123 --> 01:21:49.122
He told me all about you.

01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:51.489
Every sordid little soiree.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.817
I'm not listening to this.
I've used this before.

01:21:54.283 --> 01:21:57.122
And mean to again, but you will
hear what I have to say first.

01:21:58.642 --> 01:22:00.448
Or I will shoot you where you stand.

01:22:00.473 --> 01:22:02.122
Please... I didn't know!

01:22:02.123 --> 01:22:05.122
You knew someone was being cast
aside, you just didn't know who.

01:22:05.123 --> 01:22:06.758
Adam didn't love you.

01:22:07.453 --> 01:22:08.771
He was doing it to get at your husband.

01:22:08.772 --> 01:22:10.672
Once he got bored of that, he was
going to drop you.

01:22:10.673 --> 01:22:13.122
- That's not true.
- Oh, every word.

01:22:13.363 --> 01:22:15.122
He told me.

01:22:15.123 --> 01:22:16.750
He hated you. Both of you.

01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:19.122
But you most of all.

01:22:19.123 --> 01:22:21.122
You stupid, venal, bitch.

01:22:21.523 --> 01:22:23.122
I hate her.

01:22:23.123 --> 01:22:25.698
'It was just a bit of fun, you know?

01:22:25.699 --> 01:22:28.697
'And she had to go
and turn it into some big thing.

01:22:30.043 --> 01:22:32.122
'You want to know the truth about Hildy?

01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:34.122
'She makes my flesh crawl.'

01:22:36.643 --> 01:22:38.568
He was good at everything.

01:22:38.923 --> 01:22:40.122
Even cruelty.

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:42.122
You don't deny it, then?
Your affair with Adam Drake.

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.162
I would have screamed it
from the rooftops.

01:22:44.163 --> 01:22:45.882
Hilds? It's not true?

01:22:45.883 --> 01:22:49.122
Why? Because I've always been
the sensible one?

01:22:49.563 --> 01:22:51.122
Level-headed Hildy.

01:22:51.123 --> 01:22:54.122
Boring and a bit bossy,
but devoted to the company.

01:22:54.843 --> 01:22:58.714
While you dreamed of space rockets,
I took care of business...

01:22:58.715 --> 01:23:01.584
And you always have.
That clapped-out old Austin Seven

01:23:01.585 --> 01:23:03.726
you kept ticking over,
so you never missed a booking,

01:23:03.727 --> 01:23:05.947
that's how you
knew your way round a motor.

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:08.533
You cut the brakes
on Isobel Humbolt's car.

01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:11.559
But you couldn't have known
that instead of Isobel driving,

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.122
it would be the man you loved.

01:23:13.123 --> 01:23:16.122
Eric Gidby told you that he'd seen
the car that had killed his wife.

01:23:16.123 --> 01:23:18.611
The same car Isobel Humbolt was driving

01:23:18.612 --> 01:23:20.482
when she visited the studios.

01:23:20.483 --> 01:23:23.123
So you killed him
and made it look like a suicide.

01:23:29.563 --> 01:23:32.122
She took my happiness.

01:23:32.683 --> 01:23:34.123
Put the gun down.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.763
How did she know the kids were missing?

01:23:51.123 --> 01:23:54.323
Her brother said they heard
the appeal go out on the wireless.

01:23:58.123 --> 01:24:00.122
It's my name on the charge sheet.

01:24:00.123 --> 01:24:01.523
Just so we're clear.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.669
He knows what he's doing.

01:24:05.403 --> 01:24:06.763
Do you, though?

01:24:18.016 --> 01:24:20.016
Still in the game, then?

01:24:20.963 --> 01:24:22.387
We need to talk.

01:24:22.782 --> 01:24:24.122
About George.

01:24:24.763 --> 01:24:26.122
Not here.

01:24:26.123 --> 01:24:27.443
Not now.

01:24:28.123 --> 01:24:29.323
That's that, then?

01:24:30.843 --> 01:24:32.122
No.

01:24:34.678 --> 01:24:35.830
Have you found them?

01:24:35.831 --> 01:24:38.122
Not yet. But I think I know
where they're going to be.

01:24:38.123 --> 01:24:39.803
And when.

01:24:42.843 --> 01:24:44.122
And that one?

01:24:44.123 --> 01:24:46.403
That's Ursa Major. The Great Bear.

01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:48.563
And that one?

01:24:48.564 --> 01:24:50.423
You know that one. Orion.

01:24:50.424 --> 01:24:53.122
Are the spacemen really up there now?

01:24:53.603 --> 01:24:55.122
Flora.

01:24:56.243 --> 01:24:58.543
- There you are.
- Where are you going?

01:24:58.544 --> 01:25:01.122
Just here.
See how many stars you can count.

01:25:01.123 --> 01:25:03.681
- We've been worried about you.
- Am I in trouble?

01:25:04.242 --> 01:25:05.616
- No.
- No.

01:25:05.617 --> 01:25:07.122
Are they?

01:25:08.763 --> 01:25:10.603
I knew something bad was going to happen.

01:25:12.763 --> 01:25:14.796
I thought grown-ups
were meant to be grown up.

01:25:15.403 --> 01:25:17.766
They are, usually.

01:25:17.767 --> 01:25:19.122
But not her.

01:25:19.123 --> 01:25:21.122
She's so involved
in her own adult mess...

01:25:22.123 --> 01:25:25.122
I don't know what they've done,
but please don't split us up.

01:25:25.123 --> 01:25:27.122
- Matty needs me.
- No-one's even talking about that...

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:28.683
I promise you.

01:25:32.803 --> 01:25:34.122
How did you know?

01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:37.122
I don't know. I just did.

01:25:37.123 --> 01:25:38.802
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:41.322
- Yeah?
- I've been reading.

01:25:41.923 --> 01:25:43.122
According to Cherokee myths,

01:25:43.123 --> 01:25:45.802
there was a race
called the Moon-Eyed People.

01:25:45.803 --> 01:25:47.122
Let's get your stuff.

01:25:47.123 --> 01:25:50.122
They called them that because
they didn't see well in daylight.

01:25:50.123 --> 01:25:52.122
Their eyes were more suited to the night.

01:25:52.123 --> 01:25:53.962
Maybe you're one of them.

01:25:53.963 --> 01:25:55.123
Hm.

01:25:57.869 --> 01:25:59.228
You OK?

01:25:59.923 --> 01:26:01.122
Come on.

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:03.123
Let's get you into the warmth.

01:26:15.949 --> 01:26:16.949
Car's outside.

01:26:21.603 --> 01:26:23.122
So where will they go now?

01:26:24.043 --> 01:26:25.797
A period in care, most probably.

01:26:25.798 --> 01:26:27.642
We're staying together!

01:26:27.643 --> 01:26:29.122
Yes, you'll stay together.

01:26:29.483 --> 01:26:34.203
Miss, Flora says
we might get a new mummy and daddy.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.691
Can't we come and live with you?

01:26:37.043 --> 01:26:38.122
With me?

01:26:38.756 --> 01:26:40.274
Will you be our new mummy and daddy?

01:26:40.603 --> 01:26:43.122
They're not married.
They're just friends.

01:26:43.123 --> 01:26:44.323
Really?

01:26:50.303 --> 01:26:51.804
Come on, then.

01:26:51.829 --> 01:26:53.829
Let's see about getting you settled.

01:26:56.703 --> 01:26:57.903
Thank you.

01:27:19.546 --> 01:27:21.405
Destination, moon.

01:27:21.406 --> 01:27:23.122
A lunar landing.

01:27:23.123 --> 01:27:26.243
And for Neil Armstrong, one small step.

01:27:26.803 --> 01:27:30.807
Lights on. 40ft down. Two and a half.

01:27:30.808 --> 01:27:32.122
Kicking up some dust.

01:27:32.519 --> 01:27:35.122
Four forward. Four forward.

01:27:35.123 --> 01:27:36.123
Drifting to the right a little.

01:27:36.124 --> 01:27:38.563
Contact light. OK, engine stop.

01:27:40.163 --> 01:27:43.823
Tranquility Base here.
The eagle has landed.

01:27:43.824 --> 01:27:46.203
OK. I'm going to step off the LM now.

01:27:47.123 --> 01:27:49.523
That's one small step for man,

01:27:50.563 --> 01:27:54.123
one giant leap for mankind.
