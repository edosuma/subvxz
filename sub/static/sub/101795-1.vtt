WEBVTT

00:59.875 --> 01:03.045
Proportion
drive nominal, standing by.

01:03.078 --> 01:03.980
We okay back there?

01:04.513 --> 01:07.416
Roger that, I'm fine.

01:07.448 --> 01:08.950
We're fine, everything's fine.

01:11.085 --> 01:12.721
Hang on, something's up.

01:12.754 --> 01:14.823
Oof, yeah,
I can see that.

01:14.856 --> 01:16.391
Aw, Jesus.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.792
The plasma injector again.

01:17.825 --> 01:18.860
You said
you'd fixed it.

01:18.894 --> 01:20.096
I did fix it.

01:20.129 --> 01:21.731
Doesn't
seem very fixed.

01:22.063 --> 01:23.264
Hang on.

01:23.299 --> 01:26.535
Mandatory fix. You
having problems over there?

01:26.567 --> 01:27.703
Negative, Gray leader.

01:27.736 --> 01:29.838
Just a few bumps,
nothing to worry about.

01:35.043 --> 01:38.848
If you could just flutter
the injector a bit.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.849
The plasma core
connection's a little fuzzy.

01:46.489 --> 01:48.457
Aw yeah, that works.

01:51.826 --> 01:53.462
Did you hit it?

01:53.495 --> 01:54.730
I definitely didn't.

01:54.763 --> 01:57.099
This is commander
Gemini squadron.

01:57.132 --> 01:58.568
Comms check, report in.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.969
Starting with you, Sol.

02:01.003 --> 02:03.539
Yeah, I know, lead gunner
with you as always.

02:03.572 --> 02:05.007
Gray two checking in.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.609
Gray two gunner, standing by.

02:07.643 --> 02:08.844
Gray three checking in.

02:11.947 --> 02:13.983
Gray three gunner standing by.

02:14.015 --> 02:15.417
Gray four standing.

02:16.518 --> 02:18.788
Gray four, good enough, ready.

02:20.122 --> 02:21.657
Gray five ready.

02:21.689 --> 02:23.725
Gray five gunner, standing by

02:23.758 --> 02:24.793
Gray six, standing by.

02:26.527 --> 02:28.663
Gray six gunner, standing by.

02:28.697 --> 02:31.667
Gray seven standing by.

02:31.699 --> 02:33.868
Gray seven gunner checking in.

02:33.901 --> 02:34.836
Admiral Marshall's
leading the strike

02:34.870 --> 02:37.605
from the Valiant and
has forwarded a briefing

02:37.639 --> 02:38.908
with our tactical data.

02:39.307 --> 02:41.009
Access codes are

02:41.043 --> 02:44.147
zero, alpha,
November, beta, four.

02:44.713 --> 02:45.747
Beta four.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.818
Transmitting the
Admiral's briefing

02:52.554 --> 02:56.192
June squadron, Colonel
Danforth, XO on the Valiant

02:56.224 --> 02:58.894
and acting as liaison
for.

02:58.926 --> 03:01.864
We're proud to have your
Gemini unit with us here today.

03:01.896 --> 03:03.164
Coming from our reserves,

03:03.198 --> 03:05.634
this situation may seem
a little nerve wracking,

03:05.667 --> 03:07.469
- but we stand at...
- No, no.

03:09.872 --> 03:10.840
A turning point.

03:10.872 --> 03:13.808
A chance to finally gain
some much needed ground

03:13.842 --> 03:16.946
and bring this terrible,
terrible war to an end.

03:16.979 --> 03:20.115
By now, your blood is pumping
and you're ready for a fight,

03:20.147 --> 03:23.085
but, afraid I must disappoint.

03:24.286 --> 03:26.955
Upon arrival you
will hold position

03:26.989 --> 03:30.058
in the vicinity of
the Arabus system.

03:30.092 --> 03:32.761
Once we have gained
superiority over the sector,

03:32.794 --> 03:35.097
our stellar comness
will begin to judge

03:35.129 --> 03:37.066
the atmosphere on Arabus,

03:37.098 --> 03:38.967
providing us with
the opportunity

03:39.001 --> 03:42.972
to push this wretched war a
good distance from Terra prime.

03:43.004 --> 03:45.941
We anticipate the assault
to be moderately brief.

03:45.973 --> 03:48.710
We're looking at
a donkey's gallop.

03:48.743 --> 03:49.579
Short and sweet.

03:50.712 --> 03:53.681
Should be coming to a conclusion
by the time you arrive,

03:53.715 --> 03:56.718
but precautions in place
in case there is a delay,

03:56.752 --> 03:59.921
primarily, as I'm sure you've
noticed, the life support in

03:59.955 --> 04:03.292
your flight suits has been
increased to 80 hours.

04:03.324 --> 04:04.926
The downside of this of course,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.596
is that you will be required
to assess the stellar

04:07.628 --> 04:09.731
colonists for quite some time

04:09.764 --> 04:11.966
after we are
finished resting up.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.034
Apologies.

04:14.235 --> 04:15.670
I thank you.

04:15.704 --> 04:17.072
And I look forward to
meeting you in person

04:17.105 --> 04:19.575
once this little skirmish
has been concluded.

04:24.045 --> 04:25.980
Transmitting
holding coordinates.

04:26.014 --> 04:27.850
Let me know if
you don't get 'em.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.120
Does that mean we
won't be fighting?

04:31.153 --> 04:33.222
I want those comms
clear, gray five.

04:33.254 --> 04:36.024
- Yeah, but just...
- Stop talking.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.661
Of course that means
we're not fighting.

04:38.694 --> 04:41.830
- What am I...
- Shut up everyone.

04:41.862 --> 04:44.600
Okay guys, we're a
few minutes away,

04:44.632 --> 04:46.701
a little conversation
calms the nerves.

04:47.970 --> 04:50.072
Gray Leader, thank you
for undermining me.

04:51.105 --> 04:52.740
- Oh!
- Seriously?

04:52.774 --> 04:56.110
- Never even crossed my mind.
- No gravitas, gravitas.

04:56.144 --> 04:59.281
- I always liked you.
- Thank you.

05:00.983 --> 05:02.651
All fighters, assume
attack coordinates

05:02.684 --> 05:03.885
for VL drop.

05:03.918 --> 05:07.122
We'll hit the initial point
at approximately six minutes.

05:09.992 --> 05:11.593
Six minutes from home to hell.

05:13.362 --> 05:16.064
80 hours, hope you took
your anti piss pills, buddy.

05:16.764 --> 05:18.933
I'm getting old,
I had to take two.

05:26.641 --> 05:28.944
Um, I've got a problem here.

05:30.646 --> 05:32.148
Yeah, I can see it.

05:33.014 --> 05:34.782
Plasma core connection's
a little fuzzy.

05:34.815 --> 05:37.018
It should hold if you flip
to the injector a bit.

05:37.052 --> 05:39.055
I'll look at it again
when we get back.

05:40.221 --> 05:41.056
Copy that.

05:42.824 --> 05:45.227
Oh, no, no, don't
get me started, okay?

05:45.259 --> 05:48.062
We've been robbed of a major
tactical advantage here

05:48.096 --> 05:49.131
and it's bullshit.

05:49.163 --> 05:52.767
Ballistic weaponry
was, no, <i>is</i> the best.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.269
Okay, it's consistently more
effective than plasma bursts.

05:55.302 --> 05:57.238
Hey, hey, hey, you're talking
out your league here, boy.

05:57.271 --> 06:00.375
He's got a point, I
prefer ballistics.

06:00.408 --> 06:01.810
Who cares?

06:01.843 --> 06:03.412
We're not gonna be
doing any fighting.

06:03.444 --> 06:07.115
, you want me
to get too close or anything,

06:07.149 --> 06:08.916
watch your trigger finger, mate.

06:08.949 --> 06:10.185
You really knocked
down about missing out

06:10.218 --> 06:12.054
on the opportunity
to get these things

06:12.086 --> 06:14.723
back for Europe,
New York, Istanbul.

06:16.324 --> 06:17.158
Quebec.

06:20.428 --> 06:22.030
You want me to shut that off?

06:22.064 --> 06:23.733
I wanna rain
down fire on 'em.

06:24.266 --> 06:24.967
Good.

06:25.334 --> 06:27.336
I wanna 'kill 'em as
slowly as they killed us.

06:27.369 --> 06:31.073
I wanna see if their skin
melts as slowly as ours does.

06:34.875 --> 06:38.846
I remember this one picture
of a dog from Quebec.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.949
It fused with the family
that were huddled over it

06:40.982 --> 06:45.788
and they'd all become this
rotten, stinking...

06:47.189 --> 06:47.956
...thing,

06:47.990 --> 06:51.026
with this silent
scream expression.

06:54.028 --> 06:55.163
It was horrible.

07:00.067 --> 07:00.902
Sorry.

07:02.237 --> 07:04.407
It's all right, he
doesn't know I was there.

07:06.074 --> 07:07.109
Nobody does.

07:07.141 --> 07:08.444
Comms are still functioning.

07:08.476 --> 07:10.378
Let's just show these
guys off for now.

07:12.913 --> 07:14.182
Approaching target.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.985
I'm not receiving any info
from the relay network.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.788
What do you think?

07:19.821 --> 07:21.290
Maybe one
of them's down.

07:28.295 --> 07:31.199
Plasma injectors fired
up and ready to roll.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.168
Approach vector green.

07:34.336 --> 07:37.038
Arriving at initial
point, standby.

07:39.374 --> 07:42.177
Cutting the L drive
in five...

07:42.778 --> 07:43.245
four...

07:44.278 --> 07:47.415
three, two, one.

07:53.988 --> 07:54.823
Whoa!

07:58.793 --> 07:59.427
Okay?

08:10.305 --> 08:13.341
- They're all behind you!
- I can't take them!

08:13.375 --> 08:14.843
No, no!

08:19.480 --> 08:22.283
We are taking a beating.

08:22.951 --> 08:25.087
Gemini squadron, standing...

08:25.120 --> 08:26.989
Gemini unit, hold position!

08:27.021 --> 08:28.456
Stand by for combat
instructions.

08:37.499 --> 08:39.067
I see them on me,
they're right up on me

08:39.100 --> 08:40.067
they're coming in fast.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.937
All three,.

08:46.841 --> 08:48.376
Help me clear up those channels.

08:57.251 --> 08:58.052
What's that?

09:03.924 --> 09:05.059
It's one of them.

09:06.327 --> 09:07.428
Is it dead?

09:07.461 --> 09:09.932
Yeah, it's dead.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.836
Mercy now. Hello big fella.

09:24.278 --> 09:25.880
Pardon my French.

09:31.452 --> 09:33.322
I've never seen
one of them up close

09:33.355 --> 09:34.223
but that thing...

09:34.589 --> 09:35.558
Huge.

09:36.390 --> 09:37.492
They still look human.

09:42.397 --> 09:45.133
They ripped
the teeth out of prisoners.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.168
As trophies.

09:51.405 --> 09:52.974
You okay?

09:54.109 --> 09:55.411
Yeah.

09:56.644 --> 09:58.079
Systems check.

09:58.113 --> 10:00.382
Gunners at levels to 2.4.

10:09.591 --> 10:11.092
Looks like you're
finally gonna get

10:11.125 --> 10:12.927
that action you wanted.

10:12.961 --> 10:13.962
I changed my mind.

10:22.336 --> 10:24.239
Can you stop
breathing like that?

10:24.272 --> 10:25.107
Sorry.

10:27.207 --> 10:28.476
We got this, all right.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.452
Found something, patch me in.

10:38.485 --> 10:43.491
Gemini group, change comms
frequency to delta 08701.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.161
Keep formation tight and focused

10:46.193 --> 10:47.362
on the work in front of you.

10:49.730 --> 10:51.133
Gemini units, do you copy?

10:51.166 --> 10:53.268
- Yes, Colonel.
- Move to holding sector,

10:53.301 --> 10:56.538
echo gamma 4-7 and
engage enemy cruisers.

10:56.571 --> 10:58.473
They're using a new
shield frequency.

10:58.505 --> 11:00.708
It absorbs plasma
more efficiently

11:00.741 --> 11:02.376
than previously encountered.

11:02.409 --> 11:04.346
Get somebody on the
ventral batteries!

11:04.379 --> 11:07.149
I can see a red light,
ventral batteries!

11:07.182 --> 11:08.951
If you have
ballistics, use them.

11:08.984 --> 11:11.119
We are not equipped
with ballistics.

11:11.152 --> 11:13.455
If you can provide any
support then we can...

11:13.488 --> 11:17.092
Negative, we're tied up
with our own sectors.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.527
You can punch through
their defenses

11:18.559 --> 11:20.995
but it takes a number
of precise hits

11:21.028 --> 11:23.264
to the dorsal shield generator.

11:23.298 --> 11:26.400
It can be done but you have
to commit to your target.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.302
Commit to your targets.

11:28.336 --> 11:30.205
We're counting on you.

11:30.238 --> 11:33.542
Do what you can
and if you're hit,

11:33.575 --> 11:35.576
make the most of it.

11:35.610 --> 11:36.412
Yes, sir.

11:37.611 --> 11:40.281
all
units are stormed,

11:40.315 --> 11:41.984
enemy cruisers are...

11:46.721 --> 11:48.590
Coordinates
have been transmitted.

11:48.623 --> 11:51.059
Gray seven, gray
five, you're with me.

11:51.091 --> 11:52.526
I'm with you Gray Leader.

11:52.559 --> 11:54.061
Let's move, flight.

12:06.441 --> 12:08.243
Targets acquired.

12:10.245 --> 12:11.746
I can't see them.

12:11.779 --> 12:13.280
Six cruisers, dead ahead.

12:13.313 --> 12:15.083
Just crossing into
sector four seven.

12:18.686 --> 12:21.023
There they are.

12:34.168 --> 12:35.803
How many turrets do
those things carry?

12:35.836 --> 12:38.072
Just three, they're
heavy duty cruisers.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.609
So, lots of fire power.
If it gets through it's gonna

12:40.642 --> 12:41.810
head straight for
Mustel's command ship.

12:41.842 --> 12:43.812
Coming up, you two.

12:46.748 --> 12:48.182
Okay, flight, pair up.

12:48.216 --> 12:49.784
We'll take the leader.

12:49.817 --> 12:51.552
Gray three and gray six,

12:52.253 --> 12:54.256
you can take the rear cruiser.

12:54.288 --> 12:56.223
Gray two and gray four,

12:56.256 --> 12:57.525
you can have your pick
from any of the ones

12:57.558 --> 12:58.492
in the middle

12:58.525 --> 12:59.827
Copy, gray leader.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.163
Dealer's choice.

13:01.196 --> 13:02.730
You point us, I'll shoot.

13:07.568 --> 13:10.405
Weapons three, let's do this.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.409
10-5, come in?

13:17.544 --> 13:21.149
Gray six, are you in position?

13:21.182 --> 13:22.584
I'm right with you, gray three.

13:34.761 --> 13:36.630
- Gray five!
- Stay in formation!

13:36.663 --> 13:37.798
- What are you doing?
- Stay in formation.

13:37.831 --> 13:38.766
It's hot!

13:39.600 --> 13:42.136
Gray five,
get back in formation!

13:52.379 --> 13:53.215
Geeze!

14:06.528 --> 14:10.764
Help me!

14:10.798 --> 14:11.633
Help me!

14:14.201 --> 14:15.836
Get it off of me!

14:15.870 --> 14:19.707
Get it off!

14:21.743 --> 14:22.578
Help me!

15:05.787 --> 15:06.955
Don't let them slip you

15:06.988 --> 15:09.858
from your coordinates,
pick your targets.

15:10.758 --> 15:14.763
Watch each other's
backs, calm and careful.

15:16.764 --> 15:17.932
We ready?

15:17.966 --> 15:19.734
Ready, boss.

15:28.743 --> 15:31.680
Okay,
flight, bring 'em up!

15:31.712 --> 15:32.647
It's hot.

15:33.615 --> 15:36.618
Regroup and
start your attack runs.

15:36.650 --> 15:40.654
Target acquired,
tone and lock, weapons free.

15:40.687 --> 15:42.557
Target lock confirmed.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.560
Gray six, fire on my mark.

15:53.701 --> 15:54.536
Mark.

16:03.811 --> 16:04.913
Come, come on.

16:11.785 --> 16:12.987
This isn't working.

16:18.058 --> 16:19.526
This isn't working!

16:19.559 --> 16:21.528
Left one strafing,
we'll stamp out!

16:21.562 --> 16:22.797
You sure?

16:22.830 --> 16:24.733
You heard me!

16:24.765 --> 16:26.000
Setting to rapid fire.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.468
Negative!

16:27.501 --> 16:29.270
Do not alter your
weapons settings.

16:29.303 --> 16:31.805
Let's go!

16:52.860 --> 16:54.830
Keep targeting their
starboard power cell.

16:55.629 --> 16:58.000
I'm coming 'round
for another pass.

17:04.571 --> 17:05.706
Target locked.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.844
Oh, come on!

17:20.922 --> 17:22.824
One, two...

17:33.034 --> 17:33.869
Oh, oh!

17:42.643 --> 17:44.813
Good work, Hawthorn!

17:44.846 --> 17:45.646
It's tough going,

17:45.680 --> 17:46.847
but keep at it.

17:46.881 --> 17:48.817
Dead force instructions
were on point.

17:49.884 --> 17:51.452
Gray four, pull in.

17:51.486 --> 17:53.855
I'm right with you,
gray two, coming in.

18:01.528 --> 18:02.896
Watch it, gray two, they're
throwing everything

18:02.930 --> 18:03.731
at you guys.

18:08.469 --> 18:11.605
Morris, we're hit!

18:26.487 --> 18:27.122
Oh, f...

18:36.530 --> 18:38.966
I'm making a run once we
have some breathing room.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.436
- What about Sousie...
- Don't think about it.

18:42.470 --> 18:43.939
I'm bringing us around again.

18:55.115 --> 18:57.551
I'm all used up, I can't...

19:21.075 --> 19:22.876
What is it?

19:22.910 --> 19:27.449
I see it!

19:35.556 --> 19:37.893
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

19:53.941 --> 19:55.143
This is a lost cause, guys.

19:55.175 --> 19:58.913
I dunno, I dunno, Yaren,
what do you think?

19:58.945 --> 19:59.980
Yaren?

20:00.914 --> 20:02.451
Yaren, gray six!

20:03.617 --> 20:06.053
Gray six, can you
hear me, Yaren?

20:08.955 --> 20:09.790
Hazel!

20:11.057 --> 20:12.093
I'm going in.

20:14.295 --> 20:15.230
Jim.

20:15.262 --> 20:18.031
I know, I know, shut up.

20:22.803 --> 20:24.773
Starboard power source targeted.

20:41.622 --> 20:45.594
I'm losing her, no...

20:48.596 --> 20:52.133
It's too hot, we're
gonna get killed, Yaren!

20:52.165 --> 20:53.934
This is suicide!

20:53.968 --> 20:56.738
Come on, get us the fuck out!

20:56.770 --> 20:57.571
We tried!

21:01.842 --> 21:03.512
We're pulling out.

21:30.104 --> 21:30.939
No!

21:39.680 --> 21:40.949
Shake it, buddy!

21:42.282 --> 21:43.083
Shake it!

21:44.951 --> 21:45.753
Shake it!

22:10.144 --> 22:11.980
It's fighting me.

22:13.948 --> 22:17.852
, we're going down.

23:16.009 --> 23:18.980
Suit breach,
catastrophic failure.

23:26.854 --> 23:28.122
External atmosphere

23:28.154 --> 23:30.090
insufficient for survival.

24:03.223 --> 24:07.961
Danger, danger, suit
integrity compromised.

24:09.029 --> 24:12.032
External atmosphere
insufficient for survival.

24:21.474 --> 24:22.309
Oh god!

24:25.311 --> 24:27.181
Hazel, Hazel, Hazel!

24:31.218 --> 24:35.189
Hazel, it's okay,
Hazel, hey, it's okay.

24:35.221 --> 24:38.026
It's okay, it's okay, okay.

24:42.061 --> 24:46.833
Okay, I'm gonna have
to pop the canopy.

24:46.866 --> 24:50.204
I'm gonna have to
pop the canopy, okay.

24:57.411 --> 25:00.448
Warning,
external atmosphere

25:00.480 --> 25:02.784
insufficient for survival.

25:04.184 --> 25:05.953
Catastrophic failure.

25:39.553 --> 25:42.023
Suit

25:51.898 --> 25:53.433
Catastrophic failure.

25:55.368 --> 25:57.571
Distress signal activated.

25:57.605 --> 26:00.908
Generated hard light
holographic life raft.

26:00.941 --> 26:03.310
Retain distance of 10 meters

26:03.344 --> 26:05.145
once life raft forms.

26:28.602 --> 26:32.473
,
condition critical.

26:43.284 --> 26:46.187
Atmosphere
completely corrosive.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.489
Respiratory functions critical

26:48.521 --> 26:51.291
Corrosion of esophagus and mind.

27:11.278 --> 27:16.049
I need to wait for a minute
for the atmosphere to clear.

27:16.083 --> 27:18.019
I'll be right back,
okay, I'll be right back.

27:19.452 --> 27:21.055
I'll be right back.

27:40.074 --> 27:41.075
What's this?

27:45.645 --> 27:48.415
Hazel, I need the
start up codes.

27:50.584 --> 27:54.422
Come on, come on.

27:58.459 --> 28:02.330
Come on, damn.

28:21.147 --> 28:24.084
I need the start up
codes, what are they?

28:45.239 --> 28:48.543
I'm sorry, I know you
probably want to be out.

28:49.576 --> 28:52.278
I'm gonna have to hit
you with some adrenaline.

28:52.311 --> 28:53.713
- I need your help.
- Adrenaline shot.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.648
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:55.682 --> 28:57.518
I'm sorry, okay.

28:57.550 --> 28:59.452
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, okay.

28:59.486 --> 29:00.688
I can help, I can help.

29:00.721 --> 29:03.257
I can help, but I
need to get the CQT

29:03.289 --> 29:04.625
out in case the fleet
bugs out, right?

29:04.657 --> 29:06.026
Yeah. Okay?

29:06.059 --> 29:07.727
Come on, you're with me, yeah?

29:07.760 --> 29:08.695
Yeah. Okay.

29:11.164 --> 29:12.133
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:13.299 --> 29:15.302
External
atmosphere nominal.

29:24.978 --> 29:26.480
Okay, listen, listen.

29:26.512 --> 29:28.615
I need you to help with
the setup codes, okay?

29:30.217 --> 29:32.253
The ship, the ship's asking
for your startup codes.

29:35.489 --> 29:37.124
Yeah, yeah, we will.

29:37.156 --> 29:39.826
We will, But I've gonna start
the ship up first, yeah?

29:39.859 --> 29:43.196
The codes, the codes, you give
me them, I'll punch them in.

29:43.230 --> 29:45.833
Alright, okay, okay,
I'll be right back.

29:45.865 --> 29:48.802
I will be right back, I
promise, I'll be right back.

29:58.612 --> 30:00.648
Oh yeah. Okay.

30:03.950 --> 30:05.219
Okay, Hazel.

30:05.251 --> 30:07.555
I need the codes, please.

30:07.587 --> 30:11.558
The digits, come on.

30:11.592 --> 30:16.597
Hazel, come on!

30:21.134 --> 30:21.769
One.

30:22.603 --> 30:23.638
One.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.278
- Six.
- Six.

30:33.313 --> 30:34.582
Come on, Hazel.

30:36.383 --> 30:37.485
Three.

30:38.352 --> 30:39.753
Three.

30:44.423 --> 30:47.528
Zero.

30:54.734 --> 30:56.169
Five.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.205
Five, what's five, Hazel?

30:58.939 --> 30:59.740
One.

31:03.844 --> 31:04.679
Six.

31:06.712 --> 31:08.415
Three, zero, five.

31:17.590 --> 31:22.729
Five.

31:54.327 --> 31:57.230
Okay, I think we
did it, we did it.

32:00.767 --> 32:02.736
This is gray six,
requesting emergency combat

32:02.769 --> 32:06.373
search and rescue.

32:10.844 --> 32:11.946
Out of range.

32:56.589 --> 32:57.692
Hazel, hey, hey!

33:02.796 --> 33:03.631
Hey!

33:09.603 --> 33:11.772
Managed the fix, I mean...

33:16.410 --> 33:19.747
I think we're out of
transmission range.

33:24.851 --> 33:27.888
It just won't reach anyone,
I can't speak to anyone.

33:27.921 --> 33:29.289
I can't get...

33:41.867 --> 33:44.771
Okay.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.875
It's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

33:47.907 --> 33:50.810
Is that better, does
that help, yeah?

33:52.813 --> 33:53.748
Okay, okay.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.355
How is that, is that better?

34:04.691 --> 34:08.329
We just wait now, just wait.

34:43.163 --> 34:43.998
Here.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.336
Can I give you one of these?

34:50.670 --> 34:52.972
Another one to put you under.

34:58.945 --> 34:59.914
It's the same.

37:01.534 --> 37:04.003
This gray six to the air craft.

37:04.036 --> 37:07.507
CQD, I'm on the surface
of Arabus, somebody...

37:22.588 --> 37:23.224
28 clicks.

37:35.268 --> 37:37.938
Come on, guys, pick up a beacon.

38:07.701 --> 38:10.871
There's some sort
of animal out there.

39:04.324 --> 39:05.159
Haze, there's something.

39:06.992 --> 39:09.996
Get this on, keep
it on, hey, don't!

39:14.099 --> 39:15.101
- Stop it!
- Ow!

39:15.135 --> 39:17.070
Stuff in range.

39:17.103 --> 39:18.172
Easy, easy.

39:19.905 --> 39:21.375
There's something out there.

39:21.407 --> 39:24.010
There is something out there.

39:29.916 --> 39:34.788
Easy, easy.

39:41.260 --> 39:44.163
- If I take us...
- We need to get home.

39:44.197 --> 39:46.367
Yes, we're getting home.

40:21.266 --> 40:22.201
Here, here.

40:28.742 --> 40:29.743
You have it.

40:36.483 --> 40:37.284
Shit.

40:38.184 --> 40:39.753
There's a ship.

40:42.922 --> 40:44.358
It's in one piece.

40:46.259 --> 40:47.927
But it's right off.

40:49.429 --> 40:50.831
I managed to get
the power back up

40:50.864 --> 40:52.199
but the engine's shot.

40:52.965 --> 40:56.235
The plasma coil's
damaged, of course.

40:57.503 --> 40:58.304
Fine.

41:00.873 --> 41:03.376
Think so, you...?

41:06.780 --> 41:07.514
I think so.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.885
And we need another
plasma injector.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.757
You, you.

41:18.423 --> 41:20.092
Fix.

41:20.126 --> 41:22.262
There's no need to fix it now.

41:22.295 --> 41:24.130
The security's still out there,

41:24.164 --> 41:25.265
they're still fighting up there

41:25.298 --> 41:28.400
and when they're done,
someone's gonna come and get us.

41:31.371 --> 41:32.206
Hazel!

41:33.039 --> 41:35.008
Nobody's coming.

41:38.311 --> 41:40.313
No reach.

41:40.346 --> 41:41.248
They'll find us.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.315
Stupid!

41:45.451 --> 41:48.822
It's sunup in a few
hours, I'll go and...

41:48.855 --> 41:50.456
I'll go and look at the
ship and see what, but I...

41:55.862 --> 41:59.298
I can, I can plug the
breach in your section.

42:05.003 --> 42:09.509
Even if I fix it, can you fly?

42:17.449 --> 42:22.455
You have to fly.

42:26.358 --> 42:29.429
I haven't flown in
that sort of thing.

42:29.461 --> 42:32.331
I could.

42:32.364 --> 42:33.199
I can't.

42:35.601 --> 42:36.435
I can't.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.072
You have to.

43:14.172 --> 43:16.108
Don't leave me alone.

43:26.219 --> 43:27.588
Just hang in there.

43:30.255 --> 43:33.525
I've still got last of this
sedative, so

43:33.559 --> 43:36.096
we may as well wait a while.

43:43.101 --> 43:43.936
Hey.

45:06.085 --> 45:07.186
The engines are fine.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.389
Plasma core is bent
but I managed to...

45:14.260 --> 45:17.464
I need a transducer
and a modulator

45:17.496 --> 45:18.697
for the busted plasma coil

45:18.731 --> 45:20.734
and there isn't
anything I can use

45:20.766 --> 45:22.068
so we're stuck here.

45:41.586 --> 45:44.090
There's a ship that came
down came down last night.

45:44.123 --> 45:45.425
Isn't one of ours.

45:45.458 --> 45:48.729
I think this was by
design on the comms.

45:49.563 --> 45:52.532
It's a direct cruiser.

45:52.565 --> 45:55.402
They will lend us their plasma
injector and we can go home.

46:39.112 --> 46:41.213
Can't you stay a
bit longer, please?

46:59.898 --> 47:02.201
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

49:58.543 --> 50:02.481
Manually
activate life support.

50:02.514 --> 50:04.683
Manually activate life support.

50:05.851 --> 50:07.820
Manually activate life support.

50:08.853 --> 50:11.023
Manually activate life support.

50:12.590 --> 50:14.760
Manually activate life support.

53:27.219 --> 53:29.021
Hair in my face.

53:36.594 --> 53:38.964
Come in, calling to
all units to fall back

53:38.998 --> 53:41.766
to the rally point,
repeat, fall back

53:41.800 --> 53:43.536
to the rally point.

53:48.039 --> 53:49.541
This is gray six, Gemini unit,

53:49.574 --> 53:51.843
to Terran command.

53:51.876 --> 53:54.045
Is there anyone, do you copy?

53:54.079 --> 53:56.782
This is gray six,
does anyone copy?

53:56.815 --> 53:57.950
I'm on the planet's surface

53:57.983 --> 53:59.751
requesting immediate extraction.

54:05.858 --> 54:09.695
Withdraw all units,
prepare to withdraw.

54:09.728 --> 54:10.663
Withdraw.

54:11.829 --> 54:13.032
Repeat,
Arabus is lost.

54:13.065 --> 54:15.601
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

54:15.634 --> 54:16.836
No, no you can't leave!

54:16.869 --> 54:19.972
- All units...
- No, you can't leave me!

54:21.673 --> 54:24.576
This is gray six, dune
squadron, Gemini unit.

54:24.610 --> 54:26.878
- You can't leave!
- Prepare to engage

54:26.911 --> 54:27.712
- bail drive.
- This is gray six!

54:27.746 --> 54:29.081
G-squadron, Gemini unit.
