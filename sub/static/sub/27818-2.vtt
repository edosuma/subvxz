WEBVTT

00:07.655 --> 00:09.344
Since consciously uncoupling
from Deals, Deals, Deals,

00:09.344 --> 00:10.655
I've been catering
regularly and babysitting

00:10.655 --> 00:12.206
whenever I need dat cash.

00:12.206 --> 00:13.862
Although I was making
an ass-load of money at

00:13.862 --> 00:16.137
Sushi Mambeaux until
they got shut the eff down

00:16.137 --> 00:18.379
for a gnarly bed bugs
infestation.

00:18.379 --> 00:19.862
I'm clean now.
I'm -- I'm fully clean.

00:19.862 --> 00:21.793
Uh, wow, uh, usually,
we don't get

00:21.793 --> 00:23.000
everybody's back story.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.827
That's, uh, surprising.

00:25.827 --> 00:26.862
Living on the edge.

00:32.034 --> 00:33.172
To circle back...

00:33.172 --> 00:34.758
Mm.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.379
We have medium-speed Wi-Fi,
draft beer on tap --

00:37.379 --> 00:38.758
Okay, what?

00:38.758 --> 00:40.896
Girl, I hope I get
to work here!

00:40.896 --> 00:42.344
So do we!

00:42.344 --> 00:44.103
It'd be $500 a month.

00:44.103 --> 00:47.103
Okay, I was
thinking more like $1,000.

00:47.103 --> 00:49.517
Whoa, that would get you
a way bigger office.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.896
All right, I'm just
gonna say it.

00:50.896 --> 00:53.172
Does this mean
I'm freakin' hired?

00:54.344 --> 00:56.137
Hired?

00:56.137 --> 00:58.103
Aren't you renting
an office space?

00:58.103 --> 01:01.379
I thought I was interviewing for
the office manager position?

01:01.379 --> 01:03.551
Together:
We're the office manager.

01:05.310 --> 01:07.206
Is this...

01:07.206 --> 01:08.862
Yeah, 495 Broadway.

01:08.862 --> 01:10.241
Together: 490.

01:10.241 --> 01:12.620
Pffft!

01:13.724 --> 01:15.551
Classic me.

01:15.551 --> 01:16.931
Whoop! Sorry!

01:16.931 --> 01:19.103
Also, got to say --
what an hysterical

01:19.103 --> 01:20.931
business model
to brand this as, like,

01:20.931 --> 01:24.206
a shared co-working space
when really you're

01:24.206 --> 01:25.758
storing people in what
are essentially closets

01:25.758 --> 01:27.379
after luring them in
with these, like,

01:27.379 --> 01:29.448
seemingly high-end perks,
but it's also, like,

01:29.448 --> 01:32.586
a bag of beer in a trash can
under a counter.

01:32.586 --> 01:35.862
YouWork is a multi-
billion-dollar corporation.

01:38.758 --> 01:40.586
That is fucking genius.

01:40.586 --> 01:42.551
Uh...

01:42.551 --> 01:45.793
Guys, don't waste my time
like this again.

01:46.896 --> 01:48.758
Nice meeting you.

01:55.586 --> 01:58.310
♪ Four and three
and two and o-one ♪

02:08.724 --> 02:10.965
Uh, okay, Fernando,
I swear I don't know

02:10.965 --> 02:12.620
why it keeps
getting clogged.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.689
Listen, lady, toilet paper's
not gonna make it through

02:14.689 --> 02:16.793
these old pipes,
much less your tampons

02:16.793 --> 02:19.172
and maxi pads with wings
for heavy flow.

02:19.172 --> 02:22.103
Okay, first of all, I have
an extra-heavy flow.

02:22.103 --> 02:24.827
Second of all,
I don't flush my tampons

02:24.827 --> 02:26.448
and pads
down the toilet.

02:26.448 --> 02:28.896
Third of all, you're saying
I can't flush toilet paper?

02:28.896 --> 02:31.310
Well, if you must wipe,
well, the other residents

02:31.310 --> 02:34.137
use a separate garbage can
for their used toilet paper,

02:34.137 --> 02:35.827
and they don't make
a stink about it.

02:35.827 --> 02:37.689
Stink.

02:37.689 --> 02:41.689
So I can't poop, wipe,
and flush in my own apartment?

02:41.689 --> 02:43.482
I mean, that's
some third-world shit.

02:43.482 --> 02:45.034
You mean
developing nation.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.827
I-I-I did mean that.

02:46.827 --> 02:48.137
That is --
That is right.

02:48.137 --> 02:50.724
Well, I grew up using
a shit bucket.

02:50.724 --> 02:54.206
And I did not mean that
in a bad way.

02:54.206 --> 02:55.344
I meant it in
a great way.

02:55.344 --> 02:56.965
Growing up like that
is dope.

02:56.965 --> 02:58.310
You know what?
I'm gonna get one.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.448
I'm just gonna get one.

02:59.448 --> 03:01.275
I'll get a shit bucket.

03:05.551 --> 03:08.896
All right, got some snacks,
dawg, yeah.

03:10.103 --> 03:11.413
All right, where the fuck

03:11.413 --> 03:13.000
was this interview
supposed to be?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.827
Shit, phone...

03:17.758 --> 03:19.724
I love this city.

03:19.724 --> 03:22.517
♪ Every day you praying
for better world now ♪

03:22.517 --> 03:24.862

03:59.034 --> 04:00.206
Sorry.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.448
Oh, shit.

04:01.448 --> 04:03.448
Sorry.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.000
Oh, no.

04:09.241 --> 04:10.413
I just moved here.

04:10.413 --> 04:12.724
Cool.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.620
Ilana: Mm.

04:24.310 --> 04:26.896
Oh.

04:26.896 --> 04:29.586
All right, all right, all right!

04:30.793 --> 04:31.931
All right.

04:31.931 --> 04:33.275
Geez.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.103
Linda freakin' Lodi?

04:37.103 --> 04:39.241
Linda!

04:39.241 --> 04:40.793
Linda, hey!

04:40.793 --> 04:42.413
Hey, It's Ilana Wexler!

04:42.413 --> 04:44.241
I used to work for you
at your temp agency!

04:44.241 --> 04:46.172
-Ilana?
-Come on over!

04:46.172 --> 04:47.655
-That's so crazy.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.172
-Hey!
-Ilana, hi!

04:49.172 --> 04:50.344
Oh, my gosh.

04:50.344 --> 04:51.586
So, how are you?

04:51.586 --> 04:53.137
Good, good.
I'm just, uh, working

04:53.137 --> 04:54.275
over there
in that coffee shop.

04:54.275 --> 04:55.620
What are you working on?

04:55.620 --> 04:57.827
Oh, well, I'm working on
my screenplay.

04:57.827 --> 04:59.517
"We Lost Grandma
at the Water Park."

04:59.517 --> 05:01.758
That sounds hilarious.

05:01.758 --> 05:03.793
Oh, well, it's a --
it's a drama, actually.

05:03.793 --> 05:05.413
Dope. Dope.

05:05.413 --> 05:06.931
But, uh, it's good.
It's good.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.000
I just -- the only thing is
I have to keep an eye on

05:09.000 --> 05:11.689
my stuff and my son every time
I want to take a smoke break.

05:11.689 --> 05:13.517
I mean, they didn't used
to kick us out of places

05:13.517 --> 05:16.896
for smoking
in the '90s, right?

05:16.896 --> 05:18.724
You know, I never thought
about it like that.

05:18.724 --> 05:20.724
Anti-smoking
is discriminatory.

05:20.724 --> 05:23.551
I just want a place
where I can work and smoke.

05:25.689 --> 05:29.517
You know, Linda, today
might be your lucky day

05:29.517 --> 05:33.379
because I have a situation
starting up here where you can

05:33.379 --> 05:36.689
sit and smoke and charge your
phone and your devices and work,

05:36.689 --> 05:39.413
and you never have to let your
belongings leave your sight.

05:39.413 --> 05:41.655
Whoa, that actually
sounds kind of perfect.

05:41.655 --> 05:43.965
Um, well, uh,
how much do you charge?

05:43.965 --> 05:47.034
We are charging...

05:47.034 --> 05:49.965
50 cents a minute.

05:49.965 --> 05:51.655
You know what?
I'll take it.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.482
Here.

05:54.482 --> 05:56.689
40 minutes --
45, I'll give ya.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.862
All right, awesome.
I'll go get my stuff.

05:58.862 --> 06:02.896
Yes, awesome, get your stuff,
and then come back.

06:12.896 --> 06:13.896
Abbi!

06:15.310 --> 06:16.310
Man, I got you again!

06:16.310 --> 06:17.379
Every time, man.

06:17.379 --> 06:20.241
Come on, girl.
Bring it in.

06:20.241 --> 06:22.241
Together: Hmm.

06:28.896 --> 06:30.586
Uh...

06:34.724 --> 06:37.103
Together: Oh, oh, oh, oh!

06:37.103 --> 06:38.896
Hoo!

06:40.758 --> 06:42.620
Doo, doo, doo.
Doo, doo, doo.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.310
Doo, doo, doo.
Doo, doo, doo.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.000
Pshh!

06:50.551 --> 06:51.586
-Aah!
-Aah!

06:52.896 --> 06:54.448
So, what you
looking for, Abb?

06:54.448 --> 06:57.448
Okay, so, this is
a little bit embarrassing,

06:57.448 --> 06:58.965
but my building's
pre-World War I

06:58.965 --> 07:00.241
in the plumbing,
and it's, like, really --

07:00.241 --> 07:01.517
Shh.

07:01.517 --> 07:03.965
Say no more.
Bath accessories.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.344
Dope, dude, thanks.

07:05.344 --> 07:06.620
Great seeing you.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.034
You too.
Holla at me, Abb!

07:13.793 --> 07:15.620
Hey, dude, I'm in
the middle of trying to find

07:15.620 --> 07:16.793
this thing at BB&B.

07:16.793 --> 07:18.310
Hold up,
you're at BB&B, Abbi?

07:18.310 --> 07:19.793
Can you grab me
six power strips

07:19.793 --> 07:21.172
and six extension cords
and meet me at that place

07:21.172 --> 07:23.344
where that dude gave you
that condom stat?

07:23.344 --> 07:26.034
Well, I was gonna
say stuff, too.

07:29.793 --> 07:32.379
Holy shit bucket.

07:38.310 --> 07:40.689
Dude, what is
all of this?

07:40.689 --> 07:42.034
Welcome to SheWork.

07:42.034 --> 07:44.275
We are officially open
for shiz-ness.

07:44.275 --> 07:45.724
What is SheWork?

07:45.724 --> 07:47.310
SheWork is
an inclusive work environment

07:47.310 --> 07:48.931
that caters to smokers.

07:48.931 --> 07:50.793
I see a bunch of --
no offense --

07:50.793 --> 07:54.068
trash furniture and two people
smoking cigarettes.

07:54.068 --> 07:55.586
Walk with me.

07:55.586 --> 07:58.000
So, SheWork uses
the urban landscape for

07:58.000 --> 08:00.482
a fast-paced work space
with no boundaries.

08:00.482 --> 08:02.206
Huh.If parkour is using the city

08:02.206 --> 08:05.206
as your gym, SheWork is using
the city as your office.

08:05.206 --> 08:06.379
So, correct me
if I'm wrong.

08:06.379 --> 08:07.793
People are paying you

08:07.793 --> 08:10.379
to use the free
public charging stations?

08:10.379 --> 08:13.275
So what? All the great
male entrepreneurs do it, okay?

08:13.275 --> 08:15.275
They take something
that already exists,

08:15.275 --> 08:17.689
claim it was their idea,
throw in some fancy furniture,

08:17.689 --> 08:19.137
and charge double for it.

08:19.137 --> 08:21.034
For letting people
sit on your junk and smoke?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.000
Exactly.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.137
Wait, Ilana, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.724
I'm -- I'm sorry.

08:26.724 --> 08:28.275
Smoking cigarettes
is disgusting.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.482
Okay, smoking
is obvs heinous --

08:31.965 --> 08:33.793
But who am I to judge
a nicotine addiction?

08:33.793 --> 08:36.172
I mean, I'm...fully
addicted to weed.

08:36.172 --> 08:37.931
True.Okay, you got the stuff.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.482
I thank you, bitch.Oh, yeah.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.103
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.206
Great,
thank you so much.

08:43.206 --> 08:45.000
And, actually,
a trash can is the only thing

08:45.000 --> 08:46.482
we don't need here
at SheWork.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.172
No, no, no.
This is actually mine,

08:48.172 --> 08:49.620
uh, my shit bucket,
so...

08:49.620 --> 08:50.724
Come again?

08:50.724 --> 08:53.379
It-- It's my shit bucket.

08:53.379 --> 08:54.655
Pardon me?

08:54.655 --> 08:56.344
My -- I had to get
a shit bucket.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.827
Okay, um...

08:57.827 --> 09:00.000
Who, what, how, when,
where, and why?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.793
Okay, it's a funny story.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.551
Uh, you know how my toilet is
always getting clogged.

09:03.551 --> 09:06.689
Pfft.
Yeah.

09:06.689 --> 09:09.344
Um, so, Fernando actually
let me know that I can't

09:09.344 --> 09:11.793
flush toilet paper anymore,
and actually I have to

09:11.793 --> 09:14.206
discard it in a separate bin
right next to the toilet.

09:14.206 --> 09:15.379
So what'd you say
to him?

09:15.379 --> 09:18.724
So, then I said --
I said...

09:18.724 --> 09:21.793
I said, "Fernando,
I will get that shit bucket."

09:21.793 --> 09:24.068
That's what I said,
and I got -- I got one.

09:24.068 --> 09:25.517
Oh, Abbi.Dude, I was, like --

09:25.517 --> 09:26.896
I was standing there,
and I was just,

09:26.896 --> 09:28.413
like, so stunned by
what was going on,

09:28.413 --> 09:29.931
I got bullied into
buying a shit bucket.

09:29.931 --> 09:31.620
You know, and I think
we should take this issue

09:31.620 --> 09:32.965
into the community-action
wing of SheWork.

09:32.965 --> 09:33.931
Oh, wow, is there
whole other...?

09:33.931 --> 09:35.241
Come on.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.586
Okay.
Oh.

09:36.586 --> 09:38.689
So, we have to review
our resources.

09:38.689 --> 09:39.896
Okay.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.068
The printer/scanner.

09:41.068 --> 09:42.586
So, there's
a scanning function.

09:42.586 --> 09:44.206
What you're gonna do is scan
your tits, or your ass.

09:44.206 --> 09:45.793
Make a shit ton
of copies.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.931
Disseminate them to
all your neighbors --

09:46.931 --> 09:48.517
but get this --
anonymously.

09:48.517 --> 09:50.413
Everybody's like,
"What's going on?

09:50.413 --> 09:51.896
Whose tits are these?

09:51.896 --> 09:53.517
Meanwhile, you've
planted a stack of the tits

09:53.517 --> 09:55.862
in Fernando's office,
and you pipe up, and you say,

09:55.862 --> 09:58.413
"You know, I-I think it
might be Fernando,

09:58.413 --> 10:00.896
and while we're on the topic,
why are we shitting in buckets?"

10:00.896 --> 10:02.379
SheWork -- boosh!

10:02.379 --> 10:03.931
Dude, you are
so close on that.

10:03.931 --> 10:06.034
Okay, what if I print out
a petition, okay?

10:06.034 --> 10:07.551
Uh-huh.I go around to my neighbors,

10:07.551 --> 10:09.068
and I'm like, "Guys,
this is an important issue.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.551
We shouldn't be shitting
in shit buckets, okay?"

10:10.551 --> 10:11.551
I get the full
signed petition,

10:11.551 --> 10:12.793
take it back to Fernando,

10:12.793 --> 10:13.862
and I'm like,
"Majority rules, man.

10:13.862 --> 10:15.413
Change is coming."

10:15.413 --> 10:17.275
Ooh, you are full-blown
grassroots.

10:17.275 --> 10:19.103
You are the
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

10:19.103 --> 10:20.586
of Astoria.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.068
You're the Jewish
Shirley Chisholm of toilets.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.758
Yes, I am gonna shit
in my toilet and flush.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.827
Yes. Go get your bucket
and take care of your shit.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.620
Come on.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.379
Take care of your shit.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.413
I love you, Abb.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.758
Ah, and I love SheWork.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.275
Miss, hi.

10:35.275 --> 10:37.241
Are you sick of being
treated like a filthy outsider

10:37.241 --> 10:39.517
at work because of your
tragic smoking habit?

10:44.275 --> 10:45.448
Mm.

10:45.448 --> 10:47.965
How's that Wi-Fi
working, L.L.?

10:47.965 --> 10:52.275
Ha, ha. Charging Station-Guest
is coming in clear as day.

10:52.275 --> 10:55.068
You know, we are growing
rapidly, and I'm starting to

10:55.068 --> 10:58.586
have to focus on expansion,
so would you feel comfortable

10:58.586 --> 10:59.862
watching the fort?

10:59.862 --> 11:02.068
Would I?

11:04.068 --> 11:06.827
No, I-I was asking...

11:20.862 --> 11:23.620
Hello, um, my name is
Abbi Abrams, and --

11:23.620 --> 11:27.413
I don't want to buy
any Girl Scout Cookies.

11:27.413 --> 11:31.310
No, no, no.
I-I'm not a Girl Scout anymore.

11:31.310 --> 11:32.896
I'm a grown --

11:32.896 --> 11:34.758
I-I'm actually
your neighbor.

11:34.758 --> 11:36.344
I'm just going around
letting everyone know

11:36.344 --> 11:39.827
that I'm having a tenant meeting
today in the lobby --

11:39.827 --> 11:43.655
I have lived in this
building for 31 years,

11:43.655 --> 11:46.172
and I've never seen you.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.689
Well...

11:47.689 --> 11:50.517
Wait, are you
Melody's roommate?

11:50.517 --> 11:52.413
You know Melody?
Yes.

11:52.413 --> 11:55.000
She dates that
wonderful young man

11:55.000 --> 11:58.137
who always brings me
delicious cheeses.

11:58.137 --> 12:01.000
That's, um --
That's Bevers.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.413
They're the loveliest.
I love them, as well.

12:03.413 --> 12:05.689
Um, and I'm actually
walking around today

12:05.689 --> 12:07.551
to talk about the shit --
to talk about

12:07.551 --> 12:09.896
the plumbing problem
in the building.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.655
How old are you?

12:11.655 --> 12:13.068
I'm newly --

12:13.068 --> 12:16.689
You hippies are the reason
that sandwiches

12:16.689 --> 12:20.172
in this neighborhood
cost $16

12:20.172 --> 12:23.137
with your Sriracha
and your oat milk.

12:23.137 --> 12:26.689
What's wrong
with cow milk?!

12:26.689 --> 12:28.655
Well...
Sheesh!

12:28.655 --> 12:29.793
Cow's milk makes me

12:29.793 --> 12:31.137
have to shit!

12:31.137 --> 12:32.586
Which is what
I came here

12:32.586 --> 12:35.068
to talk to you about
in the first place.

13:02.068 --> 13:04.034
This city's full of trash.

13:05.344 --> 13:08.896
This is a very important
meeting of the building,

13:08.896 --> 13:13.586
and I know you're looking
at me like I'm the hot, young

13:13.586 --> 13:14.758
new kid on the block.

13:14.758 --> 13:15.931
You're young?

13:15.931 --> 13:17.724
I'm -- I'm 30.

13:17.724 --> 13:18.931
I've never
seen her before.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.620
Who buzzed her into
the building?

13:20.620 --> 13:22.551
I know you.
4H, right?

13:22.551 --> 13:24.137
Yes.
Thank you.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.448
Oh, you're the chick
who pegged Jeremy.

13:26.448 --> 13:27.965
Yes, of course.

13:27.965 --> 13:29.206
Okay, well...

13:29.206 --> 13:30.310
I heard the moaning.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.551
You got him good.

13:32.551 --> 13:35.655
Sounded like
an Earth-shattering orgasm.

13:35.655 --> 13:37.275
Okay.
Fine.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.482
You got me.
I -- I might've pegged Jeremy.

13:39.482 --> 13:41.241
Okay, great.
But, listen, guys.

13:41.241 --> 13:43.206
Let's -- Let's focus up, okay?

13:43.206 --> 13:45.655
So, maybe, you know,
I'm not young.

13:45.655 --> 13:48.655
Great, I'm getting up there.
Great.

13:48.655 --> 13:52.241
And maybe you only know me
as the chick who pegged Jeremy.

13:52.241 --> 13:53.931
I'm -- I'm fine with that.

13:53.931 --> 13:55.034
Uh...

13:55.034 --> 13:57.758
But allow me to help you, okay?

13:57.758 --> 14:01.344
There's a better quality of life
that we can have, okay?

14:01.344 --> 14:03.172
I-I-I'm in the city.

14:03.172 --> 14:05.034
I'm riding the rails.

14:05.034 --> 14:08.137
There are changes
that need to be made, okay?

14:08.137 --> 14:11.965
I-I don't know much,
but this is what I do know.

14:11.965 --> 14:14.551
This is what I do know!

14:14.551 --> 14:17.310
We can be the change
we wish to see.

14:17.310 --> 14:22.000
Let's say "no" to shit buckets.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.068
I love Jeremy.

14:24.068 --> 14:28.034
If he let her peg,
we can probably trust her.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.482
-All right.
-My man.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.551
You are my man.
Yes.

14:31.551 --> 14:33.517
Listen, uh, let's
take a quick pic,

14:33.517 --> 14:36.689
'cause what is activism without
posting it on Instagram, right?

14:36.689 --> 14:38.172
I don't know if it exists.

14:38.172 --> 14:39.896
Yeah, great.

14:41.034 --> 14:42.172
Yes!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.344
Hello, Linda.

14:43.344 --> 14:44.655
Ilana.

14:44.655 --> 14:47.482
Did you notice I signed
a new client?

14:47.482 --> 14:49.344
Linda, you exquisite
genius!

14:49.344 --> 14:51.034
May I kiss you?

14:51.034 --> 14:52.689
Y-Yes.

14:54.448 --> 14:56.000
Mm, smoky.

15:01.103 --> 15:02.275
So tender.

15:05.068 --> 15:06.965
Fernando, thanks so much
for stopping by.

15:06.965 --> 15:08.689
Why don't you take a seat.

15:11.896 --> 15:13.793
It's good.

15:26.103 --> 15:27.758
I called the city.

15:27.758 --> 15:29.758
I told them everything.

15:29.758 --> 15:31.310
I told them
about the plumbing.

15:31.310 --> 15:32.931
I told them
about the heat.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.068
I told them about
every single thing

15:35.068 --> 15:38.172
that needs fixing
in this building.

15:38.172 --> 15:39.965
Okay.

15:39.965 --> 15:42.068
Change is gonna
come, my friend.

15:46.275 --> 15:48.827
I think you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

15:52.724 --> 15:54.827
There you go.

15:59.965 --> 16:01.689
This is not good.

16:01.689 --> 16:03.241
Look.

16:03.241 --> 16:06.827
Fernando, no disrespect
to your country --

16:06.827 --> 16:09.758
I'm from Flushing.

16:09.758 --> 16:11.724
I grew up
10 minutes from here.

16:11.724 --> 16:14.379
I apologize.

16:14.379 --> 16:17.517
I'll pass along
your demands.

16:18.862 --> 16:21.655
I'm the Rosa Parks
of poop.

16:21.655 --> 16:22.827
What?

16:26.586 --> 16:27.862
How's everybody doing, huh?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.862
Morty, you want a fresh one?

16:29.862 --> 16:31.793
And, Ms. Katherine,
anything for you?

16:31.793 --> 16:33.172
Yes, girl.

16:33.172 --> 16:34.413
Bev, anything?

16:34.413 --> 16:35.517
She on a diet.
I get it.

16:35.517 --> 16:36.551
James, anything?

16:36.551 --> 16:37.862
Got a birthday coming up.

16:37.862 --> 16:40.172
Debbie, snack, smoke?

16:40.172 --> 16:41.724
I'm not a business bitch.

16:41.724 --> 16:44.034
I am a business,bitch!

16:44.034 --> 16:47.655
SheWork, where your lungs are
your goddamn business.

16:47.655 --> 16:50.413
Welcome to SheWork,
my privileged brothers.

16:50.413 --> 16:51.689
We've already met.

16:51.689 --> 16:53.034
Hmm.

16:53.034 --> 16:54.344
You know, when
you're running a company,

16:54.344 --> 16:55.758
you meet
a lot of people, so...

16:55.758 --> 16:57.000
Listen, we've been
watching you all day,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.413
and this is
getting out of hand.

16:58.413 --> 17:00.000
Afraid we're gonna
have to shut you down.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.206
SheWork is
a woman-owned business

17:02.206 --> 17:03.586
founded right here
in New York City.

17:03.586 --> 17:04.965
You can't shut us down.

17:04.965 --> 17:06.655
Okay, yeah, hm,
okay, yeah, go for it.

17:06.655 --> 17:07.931
Yeah, let's see --
Let's see how it goes.

17:07.931 --> 17:09.620
Except I can promise you

17:09.620 --> 17:13.068
that you're gonna see YouWork
start to trend hard...

17:13.068 --> 17:15.275
but bad.

17:15.275 --> 17:18.137
Because I hooked up
with someone very high up

17:18.137 --> 17:20.793
in the human resources
department of Twitter once.

17:20.793 --> 17:22.620
One second
to side bar?

17:22.620 --> 17:24.931
Would you like
a conference room?

17:24.931 --> 17:26.413
I don't want

17:26.413 --> 17:27.655
to fuck
with Twitter again.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.275
I don't like
the sound of that.

17:29.275 --> 17:30.896
Plus we have to play them
in soccer this weekend.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.310
Oh, my God.
We'd never hear the end of it.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.413
Yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum.

17:33.413 --> 17:34.758
Let's pay her off.
Cute.

17:34.758 --> 17:35.896
Make her go away.Hundred bucks.

17:35.896 --> 17:37.103
Split it with you.Yep, I did it.

17:37.103 --> 17:38.379
Hi.

17:38.379 --> 17:39.896
We'll give you 100 bucks
to go away.

17:43.379 --> 17:45.689
You're hilarious.
What's your real offer?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.551
-$100.
-$900.

17:47.551 --> 17:49.103
-$100.
-$800.

17:49.103 --> 17:50.758
-$100.
-$700.

17:50.758 --> 17:52.103
-$100.
-$600.

17:52.103 --> 17:53.379
$100.
$100.

17:53.379 --> 17:54.551
Is this a...

17:54.551 --> 17:57.793
$500, and that's
my final offer.

17:57.793 --> 17:59.724
Fine.

18:01.103 --> 18:03.379
I guess we're not getting
a mani-mani-pedi.

18:03.379 --> 18:04.931
Man.Yeah, yeah, mm, mm.

18:04.931 --> 18:06.137
It's Friday.
That's our thing.

18:06.137 --> 18:07.724
I know it is,
but it's okay.

18:07.724 --> 18:09.034
We can skip it
this one week.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.517
Okay.

18:12.172 --> 18:14.103
Wow, thank you.

18:14.103 --> 18:15.793
Only in New York.

18:17.172 --> 18:19.103
It is a genius idea,
though.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.655
Okay, guys, it's over.

18:22.655 --> 18:26.448
Thank you for believing
in me and SheWork.

18:26.448 --> 18:31.689
You made me realize
how beautiful yellow teeth

18:31.689 --> 18:36.793
and brown finger nails and hair
that smells like soot can be,

18:36.793 --> 18:38.482
so thank you for that.

18:38.482 --> 18:40.172
All right, pack up
and go home.

18:40.172 --> 18:41.379
We had a good run.

18:41.379 --> 18:43.448
I paid
a week in advance.

18:43.448 --> 18:45.827
You know, the market is just
so up and down, brother.

18:45.827 --> 18:48.000
It's, you know, the market.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.206
Bye, Ken.

18:50.206 --> 18:51.379
Where's Ilana?

18:51.379 --> 18:53.655
She's gone.
I-It's over.

18:53.655 --> 18:58.517
But I didn't even get
to apply for office manager.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.344
Where's my computer?

19:00.344 --> 19:02.862
Who took my computer?

19:02.862 --> 19:05.275
My screenplay!

19:07.655 --> 19:09.379
Christian?

19:11.206 --> 19:12.448
Where's my kid?

19:16.137 --> 19:19.137
Man, the beauty of that
bucket is that I'm squatting

19:19.137 --> 19:21.793
so low to reach it, so I'm,
like, in Squatty Potty position.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.655
It's almost like
a two-for-one.

19:23.655 --> 19:25.344
Hold on.

19:25.344 --> 19:27.206
You shit inthe bucket?

19:28.517 --> 19:31.137
You're only supposed to put
toilet paper in the bucket.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.793
No, I know.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.310
See...

19:38.310 --> 19:39.931
Okay. Shit.

19:39.931 --> 19:41.310
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.000
Ooh!

19:53.965 --> 19:55.413
Hey, what's up?

19:55.413 --> 19:58.172
Holy shit, Ilana,
look at this.

19:58.172 --> 20:00.827
"YouWork's innovative
smoker's rooftop

20:00.827 --> 20:02.896
results in a massive
stock hike"?

20:02.896 --> 20:04.413
Those assholes!

20:04.413 --> 20:05.931
They stole my idea.

20:05.931 --> 20:08.275
I knew I should've
done an equity split.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.482
You know what, dude?
It's okay.

20:10.482 --> 20:13.758
We are still two badass
activated women.

20:13.758 --> 20:19.793
I mean, Ilana, you founded
and sold a company in one day.

20:19.793 --> 20:23.586
And I, like, mobilized
my people to form a mini,

20:23.586 --> 20:27.172
like...s-small revolution
in my building!

20:27.172 --> 20:28.620
That's right.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.068
I mean, we can be
the change we wish to see

20:31.068 --> 20:32.758
in the world if we --
if we have a dream

20:32.758 --> 20:34.172
and we rise to
meet that dream

20:34.172 --> 20:36.827
and we go high
when they go low.

20:36.827 --> 20:38.758
Mm-hmm.

20:44.793 --> 20:46.793
Oh, my God.

20:46.793 --> 20:48.241
Dude, Fernando
got fired?

20:48.241 --> 20:50.068
Oh, no!

20:50.068 --> 20:51.655
There's a new
building manager?

20:51.655 --> 20:54.448
Mrs. Kanakaredes: Raising
the rent in three months?!

20:55.689 --> 20:59.275
Oh, what
the fuck is this?

21:09.862 --> 21:11.068
You like
our sharp cheddar?

21:11.068 --> 21:12.137
I-I do.Yeah, who doesn't?

21:12.137 --> 21:13.586
It's the best cheese.

21:13.586 --> 21:14.758
I'm -- I'm obsessed
with sharp cheddar.

21:14.758 --> 21:16.482
So am I -- me too.
I --

21:16.482 --> 21:18.931
He's taking it out of my --
out of my fridge,

21:18.931 --> 21:19.965
and he must be
giving it to you.

21:19.965 --> 21:21.655
Well, they're very good.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.310
Great. That's -- I'm happy
someone's enjoying them.
