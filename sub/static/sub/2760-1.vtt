Okay, Mr. Davis,

20:44.610 --> 20:46.978
let's start with you
telling us where you were

20:46.979 --> 20:49.981
earlier that evening.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.516
Left work, went to group,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.485

20:54.486 --> 20:55.987
Group?

20:55.988 --> 20:59.890
Yeah, I help out at
some support groups.

20:59.891 --> 21:03.461
- And the drive?
- Just something I do.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.730
It's not against the law, right?

21:05.731 --> 21:09.032
I mean, don't you ever go out
and drive around at night?

21:12.870 --> 21:15.339
Due respect, I think
that's beside the point.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.642
I don't like to spend
too much time at home.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.477
It brings back memories...

21:19.478 --> 21:22.746
My wife and child.

21:25.049 --> 21:27.285
Uh, yes.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.353

21:44.603 --> 21:47.071
two counts of child sex
abuse; Did two years inside;

21:47.072 --> 21:49.073

between him and Davis.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.048
- What about the murder weapon?
- Weapons.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.617
The coroner couldn't be exact,

21:59.618 --> 22:01.552
but he suggested these
wounds could be consistent

22:01.553 --> 22:03.054
with the type of tools
and machine parts

22:03.055 --> 22:05.089
found in the back of Davis' van.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.058

- Well, they also found

22:07.059 --> 22:09.327
significant amounts of oil
and grit in the wounds,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.462

Which could've got there when he
lifted Ackerman into his van.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.937
Yeah, or when he murdered him.
Davis has two counts

22:19.938 --> 22:21.739
- of aggravated assault.
- At a time when his family

22:21.740 --> 22:23.708

enough for a conviction?

23:38.550 --> 23:41.519
Davis was found with a
dead man in his van.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.521
We have a ton of
physical evidence.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.890
No alibi, a documented
history of violence

23:45.891 --> 23:47.491
and his public defender's
still in diapers.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.692
Mitch will eat him
for breakfast.

23:56.167 --> 23:59.002
Charge him, murder one.

24:06.977 --> 24:09.245
<font color="#804040">MITCH</font>: You examined
the body, doctor.

24:10.514 --> 24:13.517
In your professional... opinion,

24:13.518 --> 24:16.020
what was the 'cause of death?

24:16.021 --> 24:17.988
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.924
And what caused that trauma?

24:19.925 --> 24:22.226
The back of the skull
was badly crushed,

24:22.227 --> 24:25.729
so it's hard to narrow
it down to any one item,

24:25.730 --> 24:27.865
but some of the marks
seemed consistent

24:27.866 --> 24:30.568
with a hammer found
in the suspect's van.

24:30.569 --> 24:34.038
And the interior was covered
in grease and motor oil,

24:34.039 --> 24:37.942
so any type of violent
struggle in that environment

24:37.943 --> 24:42.046
could've also caused those wounds
and left that trace evidence.

24:42.047 --> 24:44.748
You said, "seemed consistent."

24:44.749 --> 24:47.016
That's correct.

24:48.752 --> 24:51.755
Your report talks of abrasions

24:51.756 --> 24:56.192
and impact wounds with grease
and motor oil in them.

24:57.528 --> 25:00.096
Now the defense I'm sure
is gonna argue that...

25:00.965 --> 25:02.933
<i>those wounds indicate</i>

25:02.934 --> 25:05.536
<i>that a car ran over
Cecil Ackerman</i>

25:05.537 --> 25:07.972
as per the defendant's testimony

25:07.973 --> 25:10.607

25:11.775 --> 25:14.744

25:41.605 --> 25:44.340
It's your witness, Mr. Brockden.

25:50.080 --> 25:55.252
Doctor, the jury will be unfamiliar
with your field of expertise,

25:55.253 --> 25:58.322
so I'll ask quite a
simple question.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.759
Just how accurate is
forensic linguistics?

26:01.760 --> 26:04.295
- Extremely.
- But it's not perfect?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.697
Perfection doesn't
happen in science.

26:06.698 --> 26:10.801
Okay. On a sliding scale
of one to 10 then...

26:10.802 --> 26:13.637
you may want to
object, counselor.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.873
<i>The witness' field is
not on trial here.</i>

26:15.874 --> 26:17.494
I'll withdraw the
question, your honor.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.011
<i>You stated earlier
that you believe</i>

26:21.012 --> 26:23.681
the caller to be genuine?

26:23.682 --> 26:26.884
By this I assume you mean

26:26.885 --> 26:28.886
he was reporting
a real accident.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.119
Correct.

26:31.188 --> 26:33.324
And you can tell this just by...

26:33.325 --> 26:34.692
hearing his voice?

26:34.693 --> 26:38.195
It's more complicated
than that, but yes.

26:38.196 --> 26:41.230
What else can you tell
us about the caller?

26:42.666 --> 26:44.001
Hard to be certain

26:44.002 --> 26:45.369
from the quality of the tape.

26:45.370 --> 26:49.006
Sounded like a white male...
possibly in his 30s...

26:49.007 --> 26:50.841
from the South of Chicago,

26:50.842 --> 26:52.810
but he's tried hard
to soften the accent,

26:52.811 --> 26:54.678
not unlike yourself, counselor.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.146
Now you're from
where, Riverdale?

26:56.147 --> 26:58.014
When you say it's hard
to tell for certain...

26:59.617 --> 27:00.918
that the tape is unclear,
