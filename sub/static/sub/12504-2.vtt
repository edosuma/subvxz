[Emily] Previously on
Make it or Break It:

00:08.409 --> 00:10.641
I'm gonna load that National
team with Rock girls.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.643
The top three will go
as our top flight.

00:12.643 --> 00:15.046
- We've top three
the past three years.
- [Marty] Emily Kmetko,

00:15.046 --> 00:17.488
American gymnastics
scholarship kid.

00:17.488 --> 00:20.621
There's absolutely no dating.
Catch you with a boy,
and you're out.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.724
- OK, tomorrow we have...
- Mom!

00:23.724 --> 00:26.397
- National trials
are tomorrow.
- "Tomorrow" tomorrow?

00:26.397 --> 00:28.059
This is the biggest shot
I'll have.

00:28.059 --> 00:31.732
We haven't gotten
the security deposit check back.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.364
I'm on it. I called
the Pizza Shack

00:33.364 --> 00:35.606
and I'm gonna go
pick up my uniform.

00:35.606 --> 00:39.210
- What are you into?
- Just living. [laughs]

00:39.210 --> 00:40.611
She has a shot
at the top three.

00:43.714 --> 00:46.377
- [crowd groans, cheers]
- This is my shot.

00:46.377 --> 00:48.219
- I want my second vault.
- What?

00:51.182 --> 00:53.154
- [cheering]
- [Lauren] I can't believe this.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.257
I've been in the top three
for two whole years.
This is my life.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.688
- It'll be fine.
- Kaylie's seeing Carter.

00:57.688 --> 00:59.760
- Don't.
- Where were you yesterday?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.732
She was with me.

01:02.593 --> 01:04.435
I hired a PI.

01:04.435 --> 01:07.098
- What is it you want?
- The Denver club,

01:07.098 --> 01:10.641
they are very interested
in your coaching services.

01:10.641 --> 01:13.104
- You'll take Lauren.
- Now you're left
with no coach.

01:13.104 --> 01:15.676
Right before Nationals.
Good luck!

01:15.676 --> 01:18.709
- What do we do now?
- [power shutting down]

01:24.855 --> 01:26.357
[woman] Where are my resumes?

01:27.588 --> 01:28.759
I mean,
I know I had them in here.

01:28.759 --> 01:30.491
What would I do with them?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.293
You mean the ones
that are practically
glowing in the dark?

01:34.395 --> 01:37.128
Mom, you're going
to get a job.
Today's the day.

01:37.128 --> 01:39.670
I know. I know it.
It's just...

01:39.670 --> 01:42.733
You know what? Maybe I
should wear something with
a little more...

01:42.733 --> 01:45.136
...pow. Don't you think?
Yeah. Right? Right.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.337
OK, hang on.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.640
Uh-oh.

02:01.892 --> 02:06.197
Look, honey, I just
wanna say I'm sorry
I've been so stressed lately.

02:06.197 --> 02:10.431
It's just that there's only
five more salons to try.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.234
And one of them's the new home
of Chloe Kmetko, nail wizard.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.436
You're right.
You know what?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.338
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll get a job,

02:17.338 --> 02:20.611
- you have your scholarship.
- I hope so.

02:20.611 --> 02:24.515
- What do you mean?
- Marty dealt with all
the scholarship stuff.

02:24.515 --> 02:27.218
- Now that he's gone...
- Oh, no, no.

02:27.218 --> 02:29.580
Please don't say that this
is gonna be a problem.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.484
I hope not. I'm gonna
take care of it though.
Don't worry.

02:33.484 --> 02:36.687
- Good luck today.
- OK.

02:38.429 --> 02:39.890
How do I look?

02:39.890 --> 02:43.564
- Pow-wow.
- [laughs]

02:44.435 --> 02:45.666
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.667
- Are we off early again today?
- I guess so.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.769
This place is nuts
without Marty.

03:25.276 --> 03:28.409
Tanner could drive his Hummer
through the loopholes
in Marty's contract.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.411
Well, maybe
it's for the best.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.742
How can it possibly
be for the best?

03:31.742 --> 03:34.645
Nationals are around the corner,
we're minus a head coach

03:34.645 --> 03:37.718
and the list of people
as good as Marty
is this long.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.820
I never figured Marty for
a guy that could be bought.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.753
- Everyone has their price.
- You think he left
for the money?

03:42.753 --> 03:46.827
Honestly, Alex, you think
anybody with an Olympic medal
is so virtuous?

03:46.827 --> 03:49.930
Marty was just a man.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.733
With weaknesses
just like any other man.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.836
I gotta get ready
for this bash you're
making us throw tonight.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.510
It's a meeting,
and it's important.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.242
We've already lost ten girls
and their dues.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.774
We can't afford
to lose any more.

04:06.877 --> 04:10.881
No. You're not
squaring your hips.

04:10.881 --> 04:14.355
- Let's focus, Payson.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.287
Thought I'd check in.
How's it going?

04:16.287 --> 04:19.690
Let's just say the big boat
has hit the iceberg,

04:19.690 --> 04:21.592
- and now we're slowly sinking.
- Hmm.

04:21.592 --> 04:24.935
- By the way, Alex called
a parents meeting for later.
- Yeah?

04:24.935 --> 04:28.769
He wants to talk to us
about the board. Right?

04:28.769 --> 04:32.002
For two years, we couldn't
get anyone to tell us what
was going on.

04:32.002 --> 04:35.706
- Now we're good enough
for the great Rock board?
- Times are tough all over.

04:37.708 --> 04:38.709
[grunts]

04:39.550 --> 04:40.711
You did it again.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.757
[Kim] Do you remember
Jim and Helen Bates?

04:46.757 --> 04:49.720
From the gym in Houston?
Of course. As I recall,

04:49.720 --> 04:53.694
- she had a little thing for me.
- Yeah, all 300 pounds of her.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.866
Listen.
They called this morning.

04:55.866 --> 04:58.599
They heard a rumor
that Marty left.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.672
They want Payson
in Houston.

05:01.672 --> 05:04.735
- What did you say?
- I told them
I had to talk to you.

05:04.735 --> 05:07.908
And it's not like we can
pick up and move.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.442
- You've already taken a big
enough pay break to come here.
- Yeah.

05:11.442 --> 05:15.686
- What about Payson?
- Well, you know
how she loves change.

05:15.686 --> 05:16.687
Right.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.893
- Square your hips!
- Are you Marty?

05:22.893 --> 05:25.396
Do you have
three Olympic gold medals?

05:25.396 --> 05:27.928
Then leave me the hell alone.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.101
- Payson.
- I'm so sorry.

05:54.985 --> 05:59.129
Hey. Hey, Pay. Come on.
What's wrong?

05:59.129 --> 06:01.361
What's wrong?
Everything is wrong!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.934
Nationals are almost here
and the gym is falling apart.

06:03.934 --> 06:07.097
- I know. It's insane.
- I don't understand.

06:07.097 --> 06:08.939
I trained with him
for almost two years.

06:08.939 --> 06:11.572
- You trained with him
for four years.
- I know.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.744
What did he say?
"We're like a family here."

06:13.744 --> 06:16.146
Yeah, the family
Daddy bails on.

06:16.146 --> 06:20.651
I just...
I don't understand.

06:20.651 --> 06:24.555
- Why would Marty leave us?
- To coach Lauren?

06:24.555 --> 06:26.717
Has anyone talked to him?

06:26.717 --> 06:29.460
Dad says he's not
returning anyone's calls.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.522
We're the ones that
should talk to him.

06:31.522 --> 06:33.894
We're the ones that had the
real relationship with him.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.467
- I know.
- I just wish I could see him.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.128
I could get this
all straightened out.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.170
You know who I wanna
straighten out? Lauren.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.703
They both have some explaining
to do, big time.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.704
For sure.

06:45.476 --> 06:48.679
- Why don't we?
- Why don't we what?

06:48.679 --> 06:52.082
Why don't we go to Denver?
Talk to them ourselves.
We deserve some answers.

06:52.082 --> 06:56.447
- Our parents would freak out.
- They don't have to know.

06:56.447 --> 06:59.850
- Pay, nobody has to know.
- Payson?

06:59.850 --> 07:02.192
- Can I speak to you
for a minute?
- Be right there.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.555
I'm about to get a lecture.

07:05.696 --> 07:09.099
Pay, what do you think?

07:19.109 --> 07:22.813
I know you're frustrated,
but you can't take it out
on other people.

07:22.813 --> 07:25.846
- I know.
- Why don't you go in there
and apologize?

07:27.578 --> 07:28.819
Come on, kiddo.

07:30.981 --> 07:32.783
What if everything
doesn't work out?

07:32.783 --> 07:35.656
Is going to Houston
such a crazy idea?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.888
Geez, the last
move was brutal.
Don't you remember?

07:37.888 --> 07:40.761
We couldn't find a house.
Becca cried for a month.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.894
My mom still asks on Sundays
when we're coming home.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.667
Do you want to go
through that all over again?

07:46.667 --> 07:50.541
I just don't want to have gone
through all this for nothing.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.643
[rock music plays]

08:13.524 --> 08:15.826
- [girl] Kaylie's
brother is here!
- [girl #2] Hey, Leo!

08:15.826 --> 08:18.729
- How's college treating you?
- Collegially.

08:18.729 --> 08:21.772
- How's the slave ship
treating you?
- Pretty brutal.

08:21.772 --> 08:23.774
- You remember.
- Which is why I jumped ship.

08:23.774 --> 08:25.706
I'm not half
as tough as you girls.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.508
And I don't look a tenth
as good in a leotard.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.712
- [all laugh]
- Hi, Leo.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.815
So you don't
have any copies?

08:34.815 --> 08:37.788
No, Marty did all
the scholarship stuff.

08:37.788 --> 08:40.991
- I know there is
some weekly letter.
- Oh, God. This is all we need.

08:40.991 --> 08:44.524
I'm sorry, Emily.
It's OK. We're just
a little buried right now.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.197
Let me go check in storage.

08:51.702 --> 08:54.865
- And here's another one.
- Another one what?

08:54.865 --> 08:58.609
Don't mind me, I've got run-
off-at-the-mouth disease.

08:58.609 --> 09:01.812
- You're new, right?
- Yeah, I just came in
from Fresno.

09:01.812 --> 09:06.917
- Oh, Fresno.
- Didn't you know? It's the
gymnastics capital of the world.

09:06.917 --> 09:10.080
- So have you seen my dad?
- Your dad...?

09:10.080 --> 09:13.223
Yay high, shaved head,
a little wired.

09:13.223 --> 09:17.227
But it's just to distract you
from his tender,
cry-at-sad-movies side?

09:17.227 --> 09:19.760
- Mr. Cruz cries at movies?
- He's like a baby.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.762
- [Alex] There he is.
- Hey, Pops.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.735
- Emily, this is
Kaylie's brother, Leo.
- Don't hold it against me.

09:24.735 --> 09:27.567
OK, the good thing is
I found your scholarship file.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.841
American Gymnastics
was very generous.

09:30.841 --> 09:33.573
The bad thing is they
all need Marty's signature.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.976
- But how...?
- The new coach will sign them.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.950
In the meantime,
give 'em some hard-luck
story to buy some time.

09:39.950 --> 09:41.812

09:52.292 --> 09:55.125
- I need this money.
- Just hang tight.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.967
If I don't get it,
I can't stay at The Rock.

09:56.967 --> 10:00.130
No worries, Emily. We'll
have a new coach in no time.

be just fine.

Thursday before Nationals.

to get her confidence back.

That's nice.

Nice.

10:41.111 --> 10:42.843
- Nice.
- Man, is she good.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.145
Yeah, but I
hear she's a bitch.

10:46.747 --> 10:51.181
That was perfect, honey.
You are still the best
beamer in the country.

10:51.181 --> 10:53.954
- Just amazing, Lauren.
- Don't you guys get
sick of each other?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.787
You work 24 hours a day.

10:56.787 --> 10:59.389
I mean, poor
Summer needs a life.

11:01.992 --> 11:06.867
So I think I can, uh,
sneak away for dinner tonight.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.869
I'm starting to feel
like your mistress.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.072
We're not doing anything wrong,
we shouldn't have
to sneak around.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.675
I know. It's just...
you know Lauren, she's...

Your daughter,
not your wife.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.813
Unless there's some
other reason you don't want
people knowing about us?

11:22.813 --> 11:26.156
- What are you talking about?
- Are you embarrassed?

11:26.156 --> 11:29.890
- Or am I just
some sort of fling?
- You know that's not true.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.061
Do I?

11:32.322 --> 11:34.194
Tonight.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.368
- I'll tell Lauren tonight.
- Thank you.

- That means a lot to me.
- All right.

Where are you?

11:59.850 --> 12:03.824
In the laundry room.
By the way, who puts
a phone in the laundry room?

12:03.824 --> 12:07.297
- Your family is nuts.
- No, you're nuts.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.930
Is this your idea
of playing it cool for a while?

12:09.930 --> 12:14.835

and... see your beautiful face.

No. I think
my dad's home by now.

12:47.437 --> 12:48.768
Where's my dad?

12:50.871 --> 12:54.304
So are we OK?

12:54.304 --> 12:55.775
Yeah.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.552
Oh, please.
You're banging your secretary?

13:02.552 --> 13:07.387
- Executive assistant.
- And I'm not,
you know, "banging" anybody.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.860
Summer and I have
discovered we have...

13:09.860 --> 13:13.193
...real feelings
for each other.

13:13.193 --> 13:18.228
When? When did you discover
these "feelings?"

13:18.228 --> 13:22.502
- Six months ago.
- Ugh. Could you
be more of a cliché?

13:22.502 --> 13:26.076
And you? I had you pegged
for a golddigger back
on the Cabo trip.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.879
- Way to take notes
in a tankini.
- Now that's enough.

13:28.879 --> 13:32.442
- Lauren, we wanted...
- Save it. You'll be out
of our lives in ten minutes.

13:32.442 --> 13:34.514
Just like all
the rest of them.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.355
- [laughing]
- Shh!

13:49.329 --> 13:53.833
I spend every waking minute
thinking of ways
we can be together.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.068
You're getting very creative.
I was thinking, um,

13:58.068 --> 14:02.442
we could make out
in the back of my car as
it goes through the car wash.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.045
- [both laugh]
- You're making fun of me.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.277
I'm not, I'm not.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.519
I think you're cute.

14:11.621 --> 14:13.924
- [door slams]
- Did you hear that?

14:13.924 --> 14:16.957
No. You're being paranoid.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.258
Right. I'm sorry.

14:22.332 --> 14:24.864
I'm sorry. I can't.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.037
My dad's been ready to blow
ever since Marty left.

14:27.037 --> 14:30.200
And if he catches us in
here together, we're dead.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.904
- How many excuses do you have
not to spend time with me?
- Excuses?

14:33.904 --> 14:37.077
- Are you kidding me?
- Relax.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.950
- We're fine.
- [door opens]

14:39.950 --> 14:42.612
- [Alex] Kaylie!
- Oh, crap!

14:42.612 --> 14:44.354
Where are you?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.959
- What's up?
- Kaylie.

14:48.959 --> 14:53.023
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I was just doing laundry.

14:53.023 --> 14:58.198
Laundry? Not once
in your entire life
have I ever seen you do laundry.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.430
- Excuse me.
- [sighs]

15:04.634 --> 15:08.378
Whatever. Look, Kaylie,
it's crunch time here.

15:08.378 --> 15:10.080
We got to nail down
endorsement deals

15:10.080 --> 15:13.143
before anyone gets wind
of our little coaching issue.

15:13.143 --> 15:14.684
[rock music plays]

15:22.552 --> 15:25.025
Carter. What's up?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.457
Not much.

15:29.659 --> 15:32.602
- How's college?
- Great. How's my sister?

15:34.364 --> 15:36.466
Scratch that,
I don't want to know.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.674
Sausage-mushroom-onion
and a small salad.

15:44.674 --> 15:48.348
- Thank you.
- [boy] There's always this
thing looming around, right?

15:48.348 --> 15:51.121
Finally, I got it.

15:51.121 --> 15:54.224
I knew it wouldn't work
when she picked "invisible".
No way.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.727
The love of your life
picked being invisible
over being able to fly?

15:57.727 --> 16:01.331
- Right?
- Well, being invisible
could be useful.

16:01.331 --> 16:04.294
You could rob a bank, for
example, and nobody would know.

16:04.294 --> 16:08.438
Or sneak into Brad and
Angelina's house and see
if they actually spend time

16:08.438 --> 16:10.740
- with all those kids.
- That's an excellent point.

16:10.740 --> 16:15.575
But, I mean, come on, who
wouldn't rather be able to fly?
It's just...

16:16.976 --> 16:18.208
I'm with ya.

16:18.208 --> 16:22.082
So the point is,
I thought I was madly in love.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.285
- Granted, I was only 15.
- You're only 17 now.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.418
- Yeah, but so much more mature.
- [laughs]

16:28.418 --> 16:30.520
So how are you
liking Boulder?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.362
I like it.

16:32.362 --> 16:36.166
What have you been up to?

16:36.166 --> 16:40.070
You know, just...
getting settled.

16:40.070 --> 16:42.602
Mystery woman over here.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.236
You got some big old
secret life nobody knows about?

16:46.236 --> 16:48.608
What are you, a spy?

16:48.608 --> 16:51.241
You must be a rock star that
only comes out at night, right?

16:51.241 --> 16:56.386
- [laughs]
- Some, like, indie,
aging Hannah Montana type?

16:56.386 --> 17:00.790
- I'm getting close, aren't I?
- Uh, no. [laughs]

17:00.790 --> 17:03.553
But I do keep myself busy.

17:03.553 --> 17:06.756
I'm, um, I'm in training,
actually.

17:06.756 --> 17:10.360
To be a ninja?
Is that it?

17:10.360 --> 17:14.364
No, wait. Foot model.
Special forces op?

17:14.364 --> 17:17.036
No. Racing jockey?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.309
Emily!

17:19.309 --> 17:22.512
- Mom! What's wrong?
- Oh, my gosh.
There's a big meeting.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.774
- What are you talking about?
- At the Cruz's house.

17:24.774 --> 17:27.317
An emergency meeting.
Alex Cruz called me.
We have to go!

17:27.317 --> 17:30.320
- Mom, I'm working.
- Oh.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.622
- Cute boy. Hi.
- Mom!

17:32.622 --> 17:34.654
Oh! We have to go!

17:34.654 --> 17:39.159
- Hi.
- Go. I'll cover for you.
I got it.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.060
OK, Mom.
I'll see you in the car.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.693
Um, yes, you will
see me in the car.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.799
I'm sorry. Thank you.
I owe you.

17:49.799 --> 17:52.802
I may be collecting on that.

17:54.304 --> 17:56.376
[honking, tires screech]

17:56.376 --> 17:58.077
You should probably go.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.781
I think your mom
is going into the
drive-thru the wrong way.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.614
- [laughs]
- In reverse. [laughs]

18:04.614 --> 18:05.785
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.557
- Peace.
- Bye.

18:07.557 --> 18:12.192
[Kim] Holy crap.
Where are Blake and Krystle?

18:12.192 --> 18:15.125
- I told you it was nice.
- Nice?
I've failed you as a husband.

18:15.125 --> 18:18.598
Pshht. We have a stackable
washer and dryer.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.670
- Ronnie, nice digs.
- How can it be possible

18:20.670 --> 18:23.733
that you guys
haven't here before?

18:23.733 --> 18:26.606
[softly] Because you've
never invited us?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.579
I don't remember saying anything
about inviting children.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.611
I only bought
so much shrimp dip.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.743
[knocking]

18:33.743 --> 18:35.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.448
Come here. Look.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.221
This is Marty
when he won the silver.
Wasn't he cute?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.793
- He was amazing.
- Who's that with the gold?

18:43.793 --> 18:46.426
Sasha Belov.
He was the only person
to ever beat Marty.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.458
- Whatever happened to him?
- I don't know.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.801
- He kind of disappeared.
- Hmm.

18:51.801 --> 18:55.265
So... are we gonna
go to Denver?

18:55.265 --> 18:58.568
- I thought
you might chicken out.
- No way.

18:58.568 --> 19:02.842
- Are you chickening out?
- No way. Let's go.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.516
So this fan made this sign
that said "Cruz In Control."

19:06.516 --> 19:10.180
And every time I saw it,
I would go streaky
with the bat.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.682
What does "streaky" mean?
Run around naked?

19:12.682 --> 19:16.326
He batted his butt off.
He was hot.

19:16.326 --> 19:18.628
- Not temperature-wise.
- I know what "hot" means.

19:18.628 --> 19:20.790
[clears throat] Anyway...

19:20.790 --> 19:22.762
- The Rock.
- The Rock.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.895
The Rock. We're looking
at a spot open on the board
with Tanner gone,

19:25.895 --> 19:30.440
and I was wondering
if you know anybody with money.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.771
We're feeling
a little pinched.

19:34.804 --> 19:37.647
Honey, why are you wearing
your brother's jacket?

19:37.647 --> 19:39.879
Hiding my Pizza Shack shirt.
No one knows I have a job.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.252
Oh. Speaking of jobs,
today was a flop.

19:42.252 --> 19:44.914
I think people are
intimidated by me.
My nails are so good.

19:44.914 --> 19:48.758
Like Lady Gaga good.
And my book is flawless.

19:54.494 --> 19:58.398
Ronnie! Hi. Thank you
so much for having us
in your home.

19:58.398 --> 20:02.932
Or should I say mansion.
You should be on MTV Cribs.

20:02.932 --> 20:05.975
Thank you.
And I see you brought Emily.

20:05.975 --> 20:07.677
[Kaylie] We're going to
Java Rama. See you.

20:07.677 --> 20:11.311
[Ronnie] Oh, good.
Bring Emily with you.
And where's the little one?

20:12.782 --> 20:15.745
- Bring her too.
- This is gonna be so much fun.

20:15.745 --> 20:18.288
We're gonna make
new friends today!

20:19.489 --> 20:20.490
Oh...

20:25.725 --> 20:28.498
What can I get instead of
whipped cream on my cocoa?

20:28.498 --> 20:31.000
I know its full of fat.
How about low-fat milk?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.863
We're not going to Java Rama
and you guys can't come with us.

20:33.863 --> 20:36.666
- Sorry, Emily.
- Hey, it wasn't my idea.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.237
- Something we gotta do.
- Go for it.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.670
- What?
What are you guys doing?
- See you mañana.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.242
- Tell me or I'm
telling Mom and Dad.
- You're a pain...

20:43.242 --> 20:45.415
- We're going to Denver.
- Denver?

20:45.415 --> 20:47.717
- Yeah. To see Marty.
- Marty?

20:47.717 --> 20:50.680
- Mom and Dad won't like this.
- Mom and Dad
aren't gonna know.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.483
- I coming too then.
- Emily, you barely knew him.

20:53.483 --> 20:58.388
- And it's really important.
- I've got scholarship stuff
that he has to sign.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.831
It's really important.
To me.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.438
- So who's driving?
- I call shotgun!

21:08.438 --> 21:11.270
- Becca, get back.
- Great.

21:18.808 --> 21:22.912
I would kiss Nick Jonas,
I'd marry Joe Jonas

21:22.912 --> 21:27.687
- and I'd kill Kelly Parker.
- Why? Why would you
kill Kelly Parker?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.619
Because she's better
than you on vault.

21:29.619 --> 21:32.622
Why don't you just
let Payson beat her?
That's way more fun.

21:32.622 --> 21:36.396
- And less prison time.
- Who would you kiss, Payson?

21:36.396 --> 21:39.629
- Nobody.
- Come on.
Who would you marry then?

21:39.629 --> 21:42.732
I... I don't know, Becca.
Barack Obama.

21:42.732 --> 21:46.005
- He's married.
- I give up then, Becca.

21:46.005 --> 21:51.040
- How about you, Kaylie?
Who would you kiss?
- Uh, I don't know, Becca.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.783
Would you kiss that guy Carter
from the gym?

21:53.783 --> 21:57.617
He's cute, isn't he? Don't
you think he's cute, Kaylie?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.749
Yeah, yeah,
he's real cute, Becca.

21:59.749 --> 22:02.422
But, you know,
lots of boys are cute.

22:02.422 --> 22:06.426
I still can't get over Lauren
accusing you of seeing Carter.
How low can you go?

22:06.426 --> 22:09.799
- [Kaylie] Pretty low.
- [Payson] I can't wait
to see you tell her off.

22:09.799 --> 22:13.633
- [laughs] Yeah.
- So, are we almost there yet?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.636
- We still got a while.
- Yay.

22:16.636 --> 22:20.410
You know who else is cute?
Kaylie's brother Leo.

22:20.410 --> 22:22.712
I'd marry him. He's rich.

22:22.712 --> 22:25.615
And super smart.
Isn't he, Kaylie?

22:25.615 --> 22:28.718
- [Kaylie] He knows it.
- What's he studying now,
rocket science?

22:28.718 --> 22:33.453
Or something. I don't even
know how to describe it.
Some save-the-world thing.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.355
[laughs] He was
a pretty good gymnast.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.759
- Leo was a gymnast?
- Yeah.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.533
- And he said he met you today.
- Really?

22:43.533 --> 22:47.767
You guys are lame.
You won't kiss anyone,
you won't marry anyone.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.870
- Who would you kill?
- [both] Lauren.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.705
Oh!

22:55.705 --> 22:59.809
My goodness. Ronnie, what is
this? this isn't even English.

22:59.809 --> 23:04.614
- I think it's German.
- Wow! You guys speak German?

23:04.614 --> 23:06.856
Actually, no.
The books aren't for reading.

23:06.856 --> 23:08.858
They're just...
They're for decor.

23:08.858 --> 23:11.861
Oh.

23:11.861 --> 23:14.694
- Oh!
- We're gonna get started.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.395
Wait, wait!
What is this?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.997
Zip Up My Heart?
That's my favorite song.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.869
♪ Zip up my heart ♪

23:19.869 --> 23:22.872
♪ Wash your hands
and walk a-way-way ♪

23:22.872 --> 23:25.034
- How did you get that?
- I earned it.

23:25.034 --> 23:27.607
By... singing it.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.581
You sang "Zip up my heart,

23:31.581 --> 23:34.644
wash your hands
and walk a-way-way?"

23:34.644 --> 23:37.547
Oh... When did
that come out?
Like, the '70s?

23:37.547 --> 23:40.089
Actually, no.
I was born in the '70s.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.452
Oh, so was I. Wow.

23:42.452 --> 23:47.527
- That's a real platinum record.
- Of course it's real.
Why else would it be there?

23:47.527 --> 23:50.960
[laughs] For the decor,
of course.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.563
All right, everyone.
We should get going.

23:53.563 --> 23:54.964
Can you believe
the nerve of that guy?

23:54.964 --> 23:56.736
"Do we know anyone
who has money?"

23:56.736 --> 23:59.038
We have the best girl in the
gym. That counts for something.

23:59.038 --> 24:03.513
Don't you dare
get into a big man
contest with Alex Cruz.

24:03.513 --> 24:05.114
Big man?
He's not such a big man.

24:05.114 --> 24:08.017
- And FYI, his baseball career
wasn't all that.
- Hey.

24:08.017 --> 24:11.180
Ronnie is just
as condescending with me,

24:11.180 --> 24:13.823
but we promised
we wouldn't be stage parents.

24:13.823 --> 24:16.826
We're just gonna have to
let this roll off our backs.

24:16.826 --> 24:19.689
And I don't think we
should tell them

24:19.689 --> 24:21.961
that the Houston gym
called and wants Payson.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.666
Remember,
we're just here to listen.

24:27.797 --> 24:30.069
What's it like being
the Buddha, anyway?

24:31.501 --> 24:32.742
[humming]

24:35.505 --> 24:37.947
So you have a scholarship?
How does that work?

24:37.947 --> 24:40.149
I don't know, exactly.
I've never had one before.

24:40.149 --> 24:44.584
But, um, the American Committee
gives us a little bit
of money each week,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.886
you know,
for dues and stuff.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.619
Wait, you get paid
to do gymnastics? Wow.

24:49.619 --> 24:51.761
My parents won't let me
take any sponsorship money.

24:51.761 --> 24:55.595
It's not exactly
sponsorship money. It's, um...

24:55.595 --> 24:58.598
- We need it.
- So are you guys, like, poor?

24:58.598 --> 25:01.100
- Becca!
- It's OK.

25:01.100 --> 25:05.174
I'm sorry. It's just I don't
think we've had a scholarship
girl at The Rock before.

25:05.174 --> 25:07.837
Yeah, you know,
good for you.

25:07.837 --> 25:09.879
- Yeah.
- Hey, we're here.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.042
Finally.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.915
So the bad news
is we can't get Marty back.

25:15.915 --> 25:19.549
But the good news
is we've got me.

25:19.549 --> 25:21.721
Since I'm the only one
who was a professional athlete,

25:21.721 --> 25:25.855
I think it's pretty obvious
I should manage The Rock
and handle the PR spin.

25:25.855 --> 25:28.858
As we all know, gymnastics
is a sport of perception.

25:28.858 --> 25:33.763
The Rock needs to continue
to be maintained
as an elite facility,

25:33.763 --> 25:36.766
or else all of our girls scores,
they're gonna suffer.

25:36.766 --> 25:39.569
So let's just keep
everything on the DL,

25:39.569 --> 25:42.011
and funnel all
communication through me.

25:42.011 --> 25:44.543
'Cause so far, no one knows
that Marty's been lost.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.716
Houston knows.

25:46.716 --> 25:49.749
- They want Payson.
- Payson's already
being recruited?

25:49.749 --> 25:52.121
Yeah. And even though we're
not professional athletes,

25:52.121 --> 25:54.624
I think we know
what's best for our kids.

25:54.624 --> 25:58.027
And the last thing we need
is another Steve Tanner.

26:00.590 --> 26:03.192
- No offense, Alex.
- Yeah, OK.

26:03.192 --> 26:05.935
Nice work, Buddha.

26:15.805 --> 26:20.249
So now that we're here, um,
what are we gonna say exactly?

26:20.249 --> 26:22.812
We're gonna go in and give
them a piece of our mind.

26:22.812 --> 26:26.285
They can't pull this
disappearing act on us.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.318
- Not that, you know,
Lauren's any loss.
- That's right. You said it.

26:29.318 --> 26:31.691
We don't need her.
She wasn't our friend.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.824
She thinks she's
gonna bury us in Boston?
We are gonna bury her.

26:34.824 --> 26:37.667
There's a reason
she came in third.
She's a great beamer...

26:37.667 --> 26:38.898
But she sucked on bars.

26:40.269 --> 26:42.932
- Holy crap.
- Damn, her bars look good.

26:52.281 --> 26:56.045
Is that Payson Keeler?
What is she doing here?

26:57.246 --> 27:00.019
- A little tighter next time.
- Wait here.

27:04.153 --> 27:06.095
- Payson.
- I think I deserve
some answers!

27:06.095 --> 27:08.828
- Calm down.
- Calm down?
Really? Are you kidding?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.305
Get back to work!

27:18.908 --> 27:20.910
Marty, we are going to
have this conversation.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.772
We'll do it in private.
Let's go.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.281
What are you doing here, Kaylie?
And why'd you bring her?

27:36.025 --> 27:39.288
Come on, Lo. We've been
friends for ten years.
We've done everything.

27:39.288 --> 27:42.161
- Doesn't that mean
anything to you?
- What about you?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.864
Doesn't our friendship
mean anything to you?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.336
- Why didn't you tell me
about you and Carter?
- It's not true.

27:47.336 --> 27:52.171
And even if it was, you
don't rat out a friend. Ever.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.906
What are you looking at?
This has nothing
to do with you.

27:56.906 --> 27:58.908
Oh, wait.
I guess it does.

27:58.908 --> 28:00.980
You're the reason
The Rock doesn't have a coach.

28:00.980 --> 28:05.014
What is your problem
with me, anyway? Besides
the fact that I beat you.

28:05.014 --> 28:07.386
You only beat me
because I beat myself.

28:07.386 --> 28:11.260
And that will never
happen again, I promise.

28:11.260 --> 28:13.963
Why? Why did you do it?

28:13.963 --> 28:18.728
Payson, some things
are... hard to explain.

28:18.728 --> 28:21.370
Like why you left me
right before Nationals?

28:21.370 --> 28:24.033
- I know you're upset...
- Upset?

28:24.033 --> 28:28.437
Marty, The Rock
was my whole life!
I gave you my entire life!

28:28.437 --> 28:31.210
- And you're gonna be fine.
- Really?

28:31.210 --> 28:34.243
Because I...
I don't feel fine.

28:34.243 --> 28:36.946
I don't even wanna go
to the gym anymore.

28:36.946 --> 28:39.048
I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing!

28:39.048 --> 28:41.720
It was never me.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.224
It was never me.
It was always you.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.828
Then why can't
I do it right anymore?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.830
Why can't
I do it without you?

28:50.830 --> 28:53.863
Nationals are coming up.
And...

28:53.863 --> 28:57.436
...I just don't
think I can do it.

29:02.011 --> 29:03.843
Do you...?

29:05.214 --> 29:07.877
Do you really want
to know why I left?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.922
I left because it was
a better move for me.

29:12.922 --> 29:16.225
- What?
- Yeah, that's right.

29:16.225 --> 29:18.227
A better move.
It's not always about you.

29:18.227 --> 29:21.791
I have my career to think about
and this, right here,

29:21.791 --> 29:24.463
- this is a better club.
- That's what you think?

29:24.463 --> 29:27.096
Yeah. It's not personal,
just business.

29:27.096 --> 29:29.238
- These girls
are better than you.
- These girls?

29:29.238 --> 29:31.871
- Yep.
- Know what I think?
I think you're wrong!

29:31.871 --> 29:34.003
I know that I'm better
than them.

29:34.003 --> 29:37.146
And I am going to kick
the ass of every
single girl in here!

29:37.146 --> 29:41.510
I'm gonna be ten times better
without you than
I ever was with you!

29:41.510 --> 29:46.956
- Do what you have to do.
- Know what? I don't
even know why I came here.

29:46.956 --> 29:50.359
I don't need
to see you ever again.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.295
You know what?
I will see you one more time.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.898
From the top
of the gold medal podium.

30:03.432 --> 30:06.906
You go, Payson.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.939
You're delusional
to think nobody's gonna
find out about you and Carter.

30:09.939 --> 30:12.041
- You're a back-stabbing bi...
- Come on, Kaylie.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.883
These people are dead to us.

30:16.846 --> 30:18.948
One more thing.

30:18.948 --> 30:21.991
Fix Emily's scholarship.
Make it right.

30:21.991 --> 30:27.556
- She shouldn't have to chase
after what you promised her.
- I'll take care of it.

30:27.556 --> 30:30.199
Then all three of us can
kick your ass at Nationals.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.338
- Kaylie...
- See you in Boston.

30:46.916 --> 30:50.219
We'll talk tomorrow,
and we'll make some
decisions democratically.

30:50.219 --> 30:52.321
I appreciate you
hearing us out, Alex.

30:52.321 --> 30:54.884
Though we were
just here to listen.

30:54.884 --> 30:58.187
- Oh. So the girls aren't back?
- Oh. They're on their way.

30:58.187 --> 31:00.990
I'm sure your girls will be
there by the time you get there.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.933
Hey, Mark, you want to hit
a Rockies game? I got a box.

31:03.933 --> 31:07.466
Hey, you guys. Thank you
for such a wonderful evening.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.138
Maybe we can
do it again soon!

31:09.138 --> 31:12.001
- Yes, we will.
- Well, you know,
I'm a little crazy still

31:12.001 --> 31:13.872
getting settled and everything,

31:13.872 --> 31:16.605
- but maybe we could do lunch.
- That would be great. Yeah.

31:16.605 --> 31:18.607
But there's no rush.
So take your time.

31:18.607 --> 31:21.650
You know, it's...
I'm still trying to find a job.

31:21.650 --> 31:23.913
- I've checked every salon...
- Salons?

31:23.913 --> 31:27.917
- Yeah.
- That's Ronnie's whole life.
She can totally get you a job.

31:27.917 --> 31:31.260
Right, babe? Your friend Margo,
doesn't she own a salon?
Or three?

31:31.260 --> 31:35.925
[laughs] Yeah.
That's no problem.

31:35.925 --> 31:39.228
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?!
Thank you so much!

you found out about

I'll take you girls home.

I won't tell your father.

Marty? What did he say?

He says he's not coming back.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.286
There you two are. We
just called Alex about you.

35:17.286 --> 35:19.718
Where have you been?

35:19.718 --> 35:22.721
We went to a movie and no one
had their phone on them.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.694
Well, you should have called.

35:25.694 --> 35:29.758
At least you guys
were having some fun.
How was the movie?

35:29.758 --> 35:31.230
Interesting.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.532
I learned a lot.

35:35.204 --> 35:36.835
No fun.

35:42.311 --> 35:44.513
[Leo] We went through it all.

35:44.513 --> 35:48.677
Little league, of course,
Pop Warner football, tennis.

35:48.677 --> 35:52.421
I was good at all of 'em,
but I was never great.

35:52.421 --> 35:56.725
And to be Alex Cruz's kid,
you had to be great.

35:56.725 --> 35:59.388
Wow. That sounds
like some pressure.

35:59.388 --> 36:01.790
Are you kidding?
It was perfect.

36:01.790 --> 36:05.834
Because Kaylie was great.
And I got to fly under
the radar and just have fun.

36:05.834 --> 36:08.497
I love baseball,
I love tennis.

36:08.497 --> 36:10.669
I still do gymnastics,
just for the workout.

36:12.601 --> 36:15.504
Well, thanks for the lift.

36:19.478 --> 36:23.412
- I knew it.
- What?

36:23.412 --> 36:26.555
Calluses.
You don't wrap your hands.

36:27.756 --> 36:30.219
I never wrapped mine either.

36:30.219 --> 36:32.791
Still have the scars
to prove it.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.793
You gotta feel your hands
on the bar to fly, right?

36:36.725 --> 36:40.229
- It's a good feeling.
- The best.

36:42.831 --> 36:45.404
When I'm flying through
the air like that,
I feel like

36:45.404 --> 36:48.837
everything else in my life
completely disappears.

36:48.837 --> 36:52.481
It's like I'm in this safe,
magical zone. [laughs]

36:52.481 --> 36:53.812
I know that feeling.

36:58.387 --> 37:02.321
- Should I walk you in?
- It's OK. [laughs]

37:02.321 --> 37:04.293
Good night, Emily.

37:15.634 --> 37:19.308
- Cute boy. Who is he?
- Just Kaylie's brother.

37:19.308 --> 37:23.241
- Kaylie's rich, hot brother!
- Mom!

37:23.241 --> 37:25.374
OK. Speaking of the Cruz's,

37:25.374 --> 37:29.017
- Ronnie thinks
she can get me a job.
- Really?

37:29.017 --> 37:33.452
Yes! Isn't that exciting?
She and I just kind of clicked.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.724
I think I've made my
first real friend here.

37:35.724 --> 37:38.387
And what about you? How are
the girls? What happened?

37:38.387 --> 37:40.629
I think I got my
scholarship worked out.

37:40.629 --> 37:43.432
Are you kidding me? OK.
We have to celebrate.

37:43.432 --> 37:46.835
How about I go
and get some ice cream.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.698
I will be back in a flash.

37:49.698 --> 37:52.641
I bet you ten bucks
she'll get lost.

37:52.641 --> 37:55.304
Do I look like a sucker?

37:55.304 --> 37:57.676
OK. It's 8:15.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.049
I say she'll be back in 45,
minus the ice cream.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.584
I say 50 minutes
and five bucks.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.317
- You're on.
- We'll see.

38:37.646 --> 38:41.590
Hey. I, uh...

38:41.590 --> 38:43.452
...thought we
said we wouldn't...

38:43.452 --> 38:46.495
Kaylie told me that they
came by to see you today.

38:46.495 --> 38:48.697
Yeah.

38:50.759 --> 38:54.633
- You wanna...?
- Yeah. No.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.967
We can't... do this anymore.

38:58.967 --> 39:02.671
It's... It's over.
I just...

39:02.671 --> 39:07.646
I wanted to come by
and thank you for not
letting Tanner expose our...

39:07.646 --> 39:11.750
- ...relationship.
- I wanted to protect you.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.583
- And Kaylie, so...
- I know. I know.

39:14.583 --> 39:19.958
I just... it's not fair
for you to have to suffer
all the consequences.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.692
I don't want you living
under Tanner's thumb.

39:23.692 --> 39:29.067
Do what you have to do,
and if Steve outs us, then, uh,

39:29.067 --> 39:31.600
I'll take care
of my side of the street.

39:32.701 --> 39:33.702
Thanks, Ronnie.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.675
Goodbye, Marty.

Hello?

41:22.180 --> 41:24.853
[Marty] Our little game
is over, Steve.

41:24.853 --> 41:27.786
- What game
would that be, Marty?
- Me as your monkey.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.988
- [laughs]
- I'm not gonna be
at your beck and call.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.220
I'm gonna do what
I want to do from now on.

41:32.220 --> 41:35.724
- What the hell
has gotten into you?
- Some sense.

41:35.724 --> 41:37.495
Oh, come on.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.198
You're not as hot a commodity
as you seem to think you are.

41:40.198 --> 41:44.633
I found you, pal.
I can find another Marty Walsh.

41:44.633 --> 41:48.637
- Well, do what you have to do.
- Do you know
what you're saying?

41:48.637 --> 41:50.779
I can ruin the sport for you.

41:50.779 --> 41:52.881
You already did that.
