<i>Previously, on
Warehouse 13...</i>

00:03.061 --> 00:05.763
I spent some time
in a psyche research facility.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.156
And I just told you
I was in an institution.

00:08.195 --> 00:09.640
This is Abigail Chow.

00:09.687 --> 00:11.974
Ms. Chow is the new owner
of the Bed-And-Breakfast.

00:12.008 --> 00:13.945
What exactly did you do
before you bought the B and B?

00:13.985 --> 00:16.011
A lot of things.
Why do you ask?

00:16.045 --> 00:18.642
Anything in the field
of psychotherapy?

00:18.676 --> 00:21.203
- Yes.
- I killed someone I love.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.917
Let's talk.

00:33.846 --> 00:35.980
Briggs!
Where is Briggs?

00:36.014 --> 00:37.447
I shot him!

00:37.481 --> 00:39.785
Detective Briggs,
I did it.

00:39.819 --> 00:41.122
I want to confess!

00:41.157 --> 00:42.524
Okay, I got this.

00:42.558 --> 00:45.594
I'm here.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.293
What is this, Purcell?

00:47.327 --> 00:49.161
A joke? Huh?

00:49.195 --> 00:50.863
Your lawyer made us cut
you and your partner loose.

00:50.897 --> 00:53.097
I don't care.

00:53.132 --> 00:55.233
I shot that guy.
I killed him.

00:55.268 --> 00:56.602
If you say so.

00:56.636 --> 00:59.739
Maybe your friend Shultz'll have
a change of heart next.

00:59.774 --> 01:01.474
So my client just ran
into the station,

01:01.509 --> 01:03.408
waived counsel,
and confessed.

01:03.443 --> 01:05.042
Yeah, that's kind of hard
to believe.

01:05.077 --> 01:06.477
You got a dozen witnesses.

01:06.512 --> 01:07.845
Yeah, all cops,

01:07.880 --> 01:09.180
and you're the DA.

01:09.214 --> 01:11.582
Well, they don't do everything
that I tell them.

01:11.617 --> 01:13.318
Why would he confess?

01:13.353 --> 01:15.754
Your own lab said
that there was no evidence.

01:15.788 --> 01:18.190
Actually,
that's not quite correct.

01:18.224 --> 01:20.393
My report said that there was
insufficient evidence

01:20.427 --> 01:21.828
to satisfy a judge.

01:21.862 --> 01:22.962
And thank you
for saying that

01:22.996 --> 01:24.997
in front of the defense,
Ms...

01:25.031 --> 01:26.699
Emily Lake.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.334
And to be clear,
I did also say

01:28.368 --> 01:32.405
that he's guilty.

01:32.439 --> 01:36.276
Open wide.

01:36.310 --> 01:39.046
I know it's difficult
being the accused.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.082
You always friendly
to confessed killers?

01:41.116 --> 01:42.883
No reason
not to be civil.

01:42.918 --> 01:45.019
We're all here
to find the truth.

01:45.054 --> 01:46.555
I thought we were here
to put bad guys away,

01:46.589 --> 01:48.256
but whatever.

01:48.290 --> 01:52.028
Yes, let's just go
with "whatever," shall we?

01:52.062 --> 01:53.029
Hands, please.

01:53.064 --> 01:55.199
Thank you.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.500
Even you have to admit,
Detective,

01:56.534 --> 01:58.802
his behavior is rather a...

02:08.713 --> 02:10.715
curiosity.

What... what the hell?

02:29.504 --> 02:30.637
Ow.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.640
Can't I read a book
for five minutes?

02:40.782 --> 02:42.283
Really?

02:42.317 --> 02:44.685
So she's not here
to run the B&B,

02:44.720 --> 02:47.021
especially the all-important
second "B"?

02:47.055 --> 02:48.890
Abigail's a therapist, Pete.

02:48.924 --> 02:50.992
She's not
a short-order cook, okay?

02:51.027 --> 02:52.527
She's here to help Artie.

02:52.561 --> 02:54.629
Make your own breakfast.
You're an adult.

02:54.663 --> 02:55.630
Sort of.

02:55.664 --> 02:57.465
That's gross.

02:57.499 --> 02:58.666
Well, this is awesome.

02:58.701 --> 02:59.868
Now we have somebody
who's gonna be analyzing

02:59.902 --> 03:02.237
everything we do,
judging our every move.

03:02.271 --> 03:04.739
I thought that was
Artie's job.

03:04.774 --> 03:07.041
Hey, Steve, you know how
to make scones, right?

03:07.076 --> 03:08.376
I don't even like scones.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.845
I miss old stereotypes.

03:12.347 --> 03:15.015
- Ooh!
- Another stereotype shattered.

03:16.618 --> 03:19.019
That's it?
Cereal?

03:19.053 --> 03:20.687
Okay, who's in charge
of breakfast?

03:20.721 --> 03:22.189
Because wheatos
is just not gonna cut it.

03:23.924 --> 03:24.924
Yo.

03:24.959 --> 03:28.528
Did you guys feel
an earthquake?

03:28.562 --> 03:30.363
- No.
- Has anything unusual happened

03:30.397 --> 03:31.497
in the Warehouse
at all lately?

03:31.532 --> 03:33.933
No, nothing.

03:33.968 --> 03:37.170
Oh! Oh!
What was that?

03:37.205 --> 03:39.339
Can you tell us
why you're asking?

03:39.373 --> 03:40.373
No, later, later.

03:40.408 --> 03:42.042
Meet me
at the FISH ASAP.

03:42.076 --> 03:44.845
- I'll just get dressed.
- Oh, this isn't, um,

03:44.879 --> 03:46.279
like, therapist business.

03:46.314 --> 03:47.748
He means agents only, so...

03:47.782 --> 03:50.083
Who says I do?
Bring Abigail too.

03:50.118 --> 03:51.618
But she's not dressed,
and you said ASAP.

03:51.652 --> 03:53.053
I'll just be two minutes.

03:57.024 --> 03:59.826
Hello?

03:59.860 --> 04:03.230
Helena?

04:07.635 --> 04:09.436
So you're a lab tech.

04:09.470 --> 04:10.604
Forensic scientist.

04:10.638 --> 04:12.539
Quite a natural fit
for me, really,

04:12.573 --> 04:14.241
with my aptitude
for science

04:14.275 --> 04:15.976
and powers of observation.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.644
Any details I needed
to play it convincingly

04:17.678 --> 04:19.379
I was able to glean
from the television.

04:19.413 --> 04:21.214
<i>I'm really hoping
it wasn't from Dexter,</i>

04:21.249 --> 04:22.249
'cause that's...

04:22.283 --> 04:23.650
That's evidence,

04:23.684 --> 04:25.986
and it's covered
in bodily fluids.

04:28.156 --> 04:30.290
I understand how
you're doing this.

04:30.324 --> 04:32.425
What I don't get is why.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.428
What happened?
We... we haven't heard from you

04:34.462 --> 04:36.430
in months.

04:36.464 --> 04:38.732
I was under strict orders
not to contact anyone

04:38.766 --> 04:40.967
while I had the astrolabe.

04:41.001 --> 04:43.002
After returning it
to the brotherhood,

04:43.036 --> 04:45.004
I wanted a new life,

04:45.038 --> 04:47.807
one far away from the world
of artifacts.

04:47.841 --> 04:49.910
Now, may I fill you in
on the case at hand?

04:49.944 --> 04:51.812
Of course.

04:51.846 --> 04:53.513
The suspect's name
is Richard Purcell.

04:53.548 --> 04:56.216
He and a partner allegedly
killed a mini-mart owner

04:56.250 --> 04:57.284
during a robbery.

04:57.318 --> 04:58.852
Both were released
on technicalities.

04:58.886 --> 05:02.189
Then Purcell willingly returned
and confessed.

05:02.224 --> 05:03.991
And when I observed him
during booking,

05:04.026 --> 05:06.527
it was as if he was...

05:06.562 --> 05:08.529
transforming.

05:08.564 --> 05:10.164
Transforming?
Transforming how?

05:10.199 --> 05:13.034
Like dangerous,
Jekyll and Hyde,

05:13.068 --> 05:15.036
werewolf,
Roseanne Barr?

05:15.070 --> 05:16.838
I don't know.

05:16.872 --> 05:18.606
In all my years
hunting artifacts,

05:18.640 --> 05:21.609
I've never seen anything
like it.

05:29.552 --> 05:32.820
I don't see any fish.

05:32.854 --> 05:33.988
I don't even see any water.

05:34.022 --> 05:35.723
Did you stop for coffee?

05:35.757 --> 05:39.826
Masks!

05:50.169 --> 05:51.336
That's the FISH.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.038
Frequency-Interfering
Surveillance Holograph.

05:53.072 --> 05:54.973
It's a scrapped CIA project
from the '50s.

05:55.007 --> 05:56.375
Yeah, it hides the Warehouse
from aerial detection.

05:56.409 --> 05:57.476
Anything that flies
over the Warehouse,

05:57.510 --> 06:00.145
radar, sonar,
or spy satellite,

06:00.180 --> 06:03.482
they see...

06:03.516 --> 06:06.318
this.

06:06.352 --> 06:08.820
Now, in order for this image
to be projected,

06:08.855 --> 06:11.023
the FISH has to maintain
a real-time scan

06:11.057 --> 06:12.758
of what is actually there,

06:12.792 --> 06:15.627
which is this.

06:15.661 --> 06:17.996
This...

06:18.030 --> 06:20.131
bird's-eye view of the mountain
and the Warehouse.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.733
This should tell us what...

06:21.767 --> 06:24.069
Okay!
The mountain did not move.

06:24.103 --> 06:25.704
It is just the Warehouse.

06:25.738 --> 06:26.871
So what's causing it?

06:26.905 --> 06:30.642
That is the question,
isn't it?

06:30.676 --> 06:33.478
All right, masks!

06:43.255 --> 06:46.424
All right,
put it in the trunk.

06:46.458 --> 06:50.994
See you at the Warehouse.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.567
So what are we missing?

06:57.602 --> 06:59.736
I don't know...
the artifact, the perpetrator,

06:59.770 --> 07:01.304
just about everything
at this point.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.173
No, with HG.

07:03.207 --> 07:06.009
She wants to give up a life
of endless wonder

07:06.043 --> 07:07.277
to be a normal person?

07:07.311 --> 07:09.646
She is not a normal person.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.114
She's HG Wells.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.682
Well, maybe she just doesn't
want to end up

07:12.717 --> 07:14.384
evil, crazy, or dead.

07:14.419 --> 07:16.220
Let's just go talk
to this guy Purcell.

07:22.328 --> 07:23.461
- Artie...
- Yeah?

07:23.496 --> 07:24.662
Are we sure Abigail
should be in here

07:24.697 --> 07:26.031
when this is going on?

07:26.065 --> 07:27.899
For her own safety,
her being new and all.

07:27.934 --> 07:29.634
All hands on deck.
We got a lot of ground to cover.

07:29.669 --> 07:31.670
- Why? You got a problem with her?
- No.

07:31.704 --> 07:32.704
No.

07:36.109 --> 07:38.410
Hey. You all right?

07:38.445 --> 07:40.112
Yeah. M-muscle cramp.

07:40.146 --> 07:42.815
Not enough potassium.

07:42.849 --> 07:47.153
Abigail ate my banana.

07:47.187 --> 07:48.654
It was supposed to be
a robbery.

07:48.688 --> 07:51.290
I only had a gun
to scare him.

07:51.325 --> 07:54.060
But then he went
for a gun too, and I...

07:54.094 --> 07:55.161
Why did you turn
yourself in?

07:55.195 --> 07:57.497
I mean, the cops
couldn't make the case.

07:57.531 --> 08:01.101
I'm asking myself
the same question.

08:01.135 --> 08:03.737
Well, what about your, uh,
your partner,

08:03.771 --> 08:05.672
Donald Shultz?

08:05.707 --> 08:07.507
They think he was
with you.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.509
He swears he's innocent.

08:09.544 --> 08:11.378
Donny is innocent.

08:11.412 --> 08:13.414
He wasn't around that night.

08:13.448 --> 08:14.949
- He can prove it.
- Why doesn't he?

08:14.983 --> 08:17.352
He... can't...

08:17.386 --> 08:19.321
say where he was.

08:19.355 --> 08:20.956
Right. So we've got
a guilty guy

08:20.990 --> 08:22.290
who blabbed
after he got off

08:22.325 --> 08:25.794
and an innocent guy
who could get off but won't.

08:25.828 --> 08:27.162
It's an irony artifact.

08:27.196 --> 08:29.298
Uh, Mr. Purcell,

08:29.332 --> 08:30.599
think back.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.200
What were you doing
just before you came

08:32.235 --> 08:34.202
to the station?

08:34.236 --> 08:36.938
No!

08:36.972 --> 08:38.140
No.

08:38.174 --> 08:39.375
No.

08:39.409 --> 08:41.110
- Hey, hey...
- Everybody leave me alone!

08:42.380 --> 08:45.816
Leave me alone!

08:45.850 --> 08:48.652
Whatever that artifact is
scared him so much

08:48.686 --> 08:51.321
that he can't even
think about it.

08:51.355 --> 08:53.990
We need to find Shultz.

08:54.025 --> 08:55.692
Please! Please!

08:55.726 --> 08:59.162
I swear, ask Purcell.
I wasn't there.

09:09.439 --> 09:11.735
Why is the Secret Service
interviewing my prisoner?

09:11.767 --> 09:13.798
Why... why are you even interested
in this case?

09:13.821 --> 09:15.403
We have our reasons.

09:15.438 --> 09:19.074
Purcell is... is too freaked out
even to admit why

09:19.108 --> 09:20.208
he made the confession.

09:20.243 --> 09:22.811
Donald Shultz
was just found dead.

09:22.845 --> 09:24.476
So who would want
to hurt these guys?

09:24.523 --> 09:25.647
Lots of people.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.449
Have you seen
their known associates?

09:27.483 --> 09:29.551
Besides, Shultz
wasn't murdered.

09:29.585 --> 09:31.052
The coroner said he died
of a heart attack.

09:31.086 --> 09:33.277
Right, a totally healthy kid
with no history

09:33.300 --> 09:34.597
of heart trouble.

09:34.652 --> 09:36.573
I'm not a doctor,
and neither are you.

09:36.605 --> 09:38.269
Maybe it was hereditary.

09:38.347 --> 09:40.241
Look, we did some digging.

09:40.276 --> 09:42.844
Shultz was arrested
the same night of the robbery

09:42.879 --> 09:45.113
in Illinois
for being in a bar fight.

09:45.148 --> 09:47.649
So he couldn't have done it.

09:47.684 --> 09:51.454
Shultz had a sheet
as long as your arm.

09:51.488 --> 09:54.202
And whether he committed
this crime or not,

09:54.249 --> 09:55.358
Purcell did.

09:55.392 --> 09:57.293
Look, this is an election year.

09:57.327 --> 09:58.761
The last thing I need
is the two of you

09:58.796 --> 10:02.632
poking holes
in a solid public confession

10:02.667 --> 10:04.134
where an innocent citizen
was murdered.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.770
You talk to my prisoner
or my officers again,

10:06.817 --> 10:08.738
I will have you arrested
for interfering

10:08.773 --> 10:11.241
with a criminal investigation.

10:11.275 --> 10:13.209
Now go protect the president
or something.

10:13.243 --> 10:15.211
- Is it possible that...
- Oh, look.

10:15.246 --> 10:16.933
I have to make
a phone call.

10:21.294 --> 10:22.594
Whatever this thing is,
Artie,

10:22.652 --> 10:24.268
it generates major fear.

10:24.388 --> 10:26.398
Yeah, are there any artifacts
that can literally scare

10:26.437 --> 10:27.340
someone to death?

10:27.359 --> 10:28.725
Yeah, only...
only hundreds of them.

10:28.759 --> 10:31.460
I mean, it could be anything
from the Inquisition.

10:31.495 --> 10:33.529
It could be the first failed
attempt at skydiving.

10:33.563 --> 10:35.231
<i>The showerhead from Psycho.</i>

10:35.265 --> 10:37.233
Oh, great,
another Hitchcock artifact.

10:37.267 --> 10:38.735
The guy should have
his own section.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.903
Yeah, w...

10:40.938 --> 10:42.905
Artie, any luck
with those tremors?

10:42.940 --> 10:44.574
Yeah, we're working on it.
Working on it.

10:44.608 --> 10:45.975
Uh, yeah, tell me more
about the physical changes

10:46.009 --> 10:46.976
that HG saw.

10:47.010 --> 10:48.177
That could help
narrow it down.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.880
Well, she saw
Purcell's face change a bit

10:50.915 --> 10:52.649
and his fingernails recede.

10:52.683 --> 10:54.651
But, uh, she didn't see
that much.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.019
But before that, what did
the guy actually look like

10:56.053 --> 10:58.154
when he first went
into the station?

10:58.189 --> 10:59.689
Well, HG got there later,

10:59.724 --> 11:01.958
but I bet they have
closed-circuit cameras.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.493
Yeah, but the DA
hates us.

11:03.528 --> 11:06.963
And no, Artie, it's not because
of anything I did.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.569
All right, now, list... listen.
I- I-I gotta go.

11:11.603 --> 11:12.937
Keep me posted.

11:12.972 --> 11:16.841
Find a way
to get that video.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.944
Hey, Mykes, you know the owner
of the mini-mart

11:18.978 --> 11:20.045
that Purcell killed?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.213
He had a family, right?

11:21.247 --> 11:22.214
Yeah.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.582
Well, if we had
a nickel

11:23.616 --> 11:25.717
for every time someone used
an artifact for revenge,

11:25.751 --> 11:27.886
we'd have, like,
a billion nickels.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.156
And in dollars,
that would be, like...

11:31.190 --> 11:32.391
Well, in nickels, it w...

11:32.425 --> 11:33.392
I got it.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.827
So... great.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.195
You go interview
the family,

11:36.229 --> 11:39.531
and I think I know
how to get that video.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.704
- This goes like this, right?
- Uh...

11:44.738 --> 11:46.673
Uh, care...
careful with that.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.642
Sorry.

11:47.689 --> 11:49.643
This building is old
and falling apart.

11:49.677 --> 11:51.512
Yes, we have that in common.
Ha ha!

11:51.546 --> 11:52.713
Beat you to it.

11:52.747 --> 11:54.682
Yes, well, how much shaking
can it take?

11:54.919 --> 11:56.420
Good point. The four of us
could take weeks

11:56.465 --> 11:57.418
to find the source.

11:57.452 --> 11:59.720
Well, you know,
the geological survey

11:59.755 --> 12:01.389
has sensors in the ground
at every major fault.

12:01.423 --> 12:04.592
And depending on the intensity
of the sensor,

12:04.627 --> 12:06.694
they can determine
the epicenter.

12:06.729 --> 12:08.063
And...

12:08.097 --> 12:09.698
Why would you have those
at the Warehouse?

12:09.732 --> 12:11.400
This is not the San Andreas.

12:11.434 --> 12:13.202
- Forget I ever said anything.
- Uh...

12:14.238 --> 12:18.741
Oh!

12:18.776 --> 12:20.844
- Claudia!
- I don't know why!

12:20.878 --> 12:22.012
Wh... why what?

12:22.046 --> 12:23.213
Why... why nothing.

12:23.248 --> 12:24.381
What do you want?

12:24.416 --> 12:26.250
The artifact removal
detection system...

12:26.284 --> 12:28.019
Oh, yes, repurpose sensors
that are already in place.

12:28.053 --> 12:29.187
Of course.

12:29.221 --> 12:31.756
Then I could boost power
to the system,

12:31.790 --> 12:33.024
make sure it feels
every vibration.

12:33.059 --> 12:35.193
I will overlay the data
onto a grid

12:35.227 --> 12:36.227
of the Warehouse
and cross-ref.

12:36.262 --> 12:37.295
Yeah, that.

12:37.329 --> 12:39.697
Nice suggestion, Doctor.

12:39.732 --> 12:44.201
Don't get a big head.

12:44.236 --> 12:45.536
I almost got it.

12:45.570 --> 12:46.904
I got it, I got it.

12:46.938 --> 12:49.573
Yukon sector.

12:49.608 --> 12:50.641
It's this way!

12:50.676 --> 12:51.676
How long have you people
worked here?

12:51.710 --> 12:54.245
I'm new.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.121
- Found it.
- My.

13:03.155 --> 13:06.791
- There!
- There's the problem.

13:06.826 --> 13:09.427
- What are those?
- Expansion joints

13:09.462 --> 13:11.229
for when the Warehouse
automatically expands

13:11.264 --> 13:12.764
to make room for artifacts.

13:12.799 --> 13:14.400
For some reason,
they're jammed.

13:14.434 --> 13:15.634
I think that's what's causing
the tremors.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.670
Great, well,
that explains everything,

13:17.704 --> 13:19.538
except for the part
where you said the Warehouse

13:19.572 --> 13:20.672
automatically expands.

13:20.706 --> 13:23.808
That's right.
Surprise!

13:27.413 --> 13:28.480
Hi, Helena.

13:28.514 --> 13:29.748
- Myka, what are you doing here?
- Emily?

13:29.782 --> 13:31.349
I asked you
to leave me out of this.

13:31.383 --> 13:33.284
Helena, it's just that
we need help.

13:33.318 --> 13:34.485
- There's no...
- Emily, everything okay?

13:34.520 --> 13:35.987
- Hi.
- Nate.

13:36.021 --> 13:37.989
Adelaide.

13:38.023 --> 13:39.424
Um, this is...

13:39.458 --> 13:41.693
A dear old friend
of Emily's

13:41.727 --> 13:44.662
who she hasn't seen
in a long time

13:44.697 --> 13:47.598
and is surprised
to see now.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.634
You're a police officer

13:49.668 --> 13:51.870
or something like
the police.

13:51.904 --> 13:54.272
You and Emily
solved cases together,

13:54.307 --> 13:55.874
and you went
on amazing adventures.

13:55.908 --> 13:58.342
- How did you...
- Well, the old friends part

13:58.377 --> 13:59.610
is obvious
from your body language.

13:59.645 --> 14:02.681
The surprise I could just see
on Emily's face.

14:02.715 --> 14:05.484
So you must be here
from out of town.

14:05.518 --> 14:07.753
And knew you were something
like police

14:07.787 --> 14:10.289
'cause, well,
you're wearing a badge.

14:10.323 --> 14:12.558
Emily taught her that.

14:12.592 --> 14:14.793
- Ah.
- One correction.

14:14.827 --> 14:16.295
There were
no amazing adventures.

14:16.329 --> 14:17.963
Myka and I
were just roommates

14:17.998 --> 14:19.665
at Iowa Tech.

14:19.699 --> 14:20.699
Right.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.701
Crazy days on the quad.

14:24.070 --> 14:27.206
Someday I'm gonna go
on amazing adventures.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.407
- Mm-hmm. Come on.
- Yes, you will.

14:28.441 --> 14:31.877
Please come in.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.981
- Adelaide's exceptional.
- And so's her father.

14:36.015 --> 14:40.853
He's a solid, normal,
kind man.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.588
Yes, he's a civilian.

14:42.622 --> 14:46.158
But that's one of my favorite
things about him.

14:46.192 --> 14:50.429
I'm trying something
a little... different right now.

14:50.463 --> 14:53.365
So how long
have you lived here?

14:53.399 --> 14:55.167
About six months.

14:55.201 --> 14:58.237
I met Nate
at a cooking class.

14:58.271 --> 15:00.873
No, don't laugh.

15:00.907 --> 15:03.609
Um, and then...
and then Adelaide.

15:03.643 --> 15:06.512
Myka, they invited me
into their home,

15:06.547 --> 15:07.580
their lives.

15:07.614 --> 15:09.815
For the first time
in over a century,

15:09.849 --> 15:12.350
I feel like...

15:12.385 --> 15:16.755
I feel like I belong.

15:16.789 --> 15:18.356
So does Nate know
who you really are?

15:18.390 --> 15:21.359
I can't very well tell him
I'm HG Wells,

15:21.393 --> 15:23.561
the 147-year-old father

15:23.596 --> 15:27.165
of science fiction.

15:27.199 --> 15:30.068
They'd put me away.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.771
So will you help us?

15:32.805 --> 15:34.873
The cops won't,
and we need that video.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.075
I can't.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.544
Myka, I can't.

15:38.578 --> 15:39.812
Helena, people
are getting hurt.

15:39.846 --> 15:40.846
One's already dead.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.314
And by the way,
you called us.

15:42.348 --> 15:43.900
So...

15:49.188 --> 15:50.522
Don't you think you owe it
to Adelaide

15:50.556 --> 15:54.225
to have one more
amazing adventure?

15:58.598 --> 16:01.132
But the defense,
the guy's gotta do something.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.901
Ladies.
She supposed to be back here?

16:02.935 --> 16:06.804
This area's off limits
to visitors.

16:06.839 --> 16:08.840
Officer... Curtis,

16:08.874 --> 16:12.743
uh, I'm sure over the years,
you've impressed a lady or two

16:12.778 --> 16:15.780
by giving her a tour
of the station.

16:15.815 --> 16:19.016
Been known to happen.

16:19.051 --> 16:21.186
Well, uh...

16:21.220 --> 16:22.621
Oh.

16:22.655 --> 16:23.788
Right.

16:23.823 --> 16:26.824
All right.
Rock on, ladies.

16:31.297 --> 16:32.430
You've been watching Claudia.

16:32.464 --> 16:34.299
We trade tips.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.301
Okay, we just have to find
the moment

16:36.336 --> 16:37.436
where Purcell came
into the station,

16:37.470 --> 16:40.439
see what he looked like.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.944
Here.

16:44.978 --> 16:46.011
Hmm.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.146
It's hard to see
any detail.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.016
What about before,
in the parking lot?

16:50.050 --> 16:52.885
Uh...

16:54.922 --> 16:56.723
Oh, my God, Helena.

17:05.965 --> 17:08.702
Pete, listen to me.
I'm putting you on speaker.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.137
It looks like the artifact
evolves its victims

17:12.172 --> 17:14.106
into a primal state.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.075
Got it.
Listen, the victim's family

17:16.108 --> 17:17.776
wasn't looking for revenge,

17:17.810 --> 17:19.411
but they... they said
some cop came by

17:19.445 --> 17:21.446
and creeped them out
with his promise

17:21.481 --> 17:22.615
to get them justice.

17:22.648 --> 17:24.416
Said his name was Briggs.

17:24.451 --> 17:26.050
Briggs, I-I know him.

17:26.085 --> 17:29.888
Uh, back up
to before Purcell entered.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.626
There. That's Briggs.

17:34.660 --> 17:35.927
What is he doing?

17:35.961 --> 17:38.196
Can you push in?

17:38.230 --> 17:39.831
He had his handcuffs ready.

17:39.865 --> 17:41.933
He knew Purcell
was coming in.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.444
Briggs is our guy.

17:43.514 --> 17:46.334
Pete, our killer
with a deadly artifact

17:46.514 --> 17:48.084
is a cop.

17:52.494 --> 17:54.353
- Secret Service!
- Detective Briggs!

18:01.400 --> 18:03.234
A primal regression artifact

18:03.269 --> 18:05.570
that may not just affect
physical appearance.

18:05.605 --> 18:08.106
The brain could devolve
as well.

18:08.141 --> 18:10.242
It sounds like you're dealing
with something

18:10.277 --> 18:12.044
that is affecting
the brain's limbic system.

18:12.079 --> 18:14.280
That is the core of our ancient
fight, flight,

18:14.314 --> 18:16.516
or freeze responses.

18:16.550 --> 18:18.184
So overwhelming fear,

18:18.218 --> 18:20.886
that's how Shultz
was scared to death.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.888
You could be dealing
with something...

18:22.922 --> 18:24.756
something incredibly old,

18:24.791 --> 18:26.458
even prehistoric.

18:26.492 --> 18:28.593
Like a piece
of cave drawing

18:28.627 --> 18:29.727
or an arrowhead.

18:29.762 --> 18:31.096
Be careful.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.634
It's still happening.
Don't ask.

18:35.668 --> 18:36.935
Now, listen,
an artifact this old,

18:36.969 --> 18:39.170
it could be
extremely powerful,

18:39.205 --> 18:41.740
including the downside
on whoever is using it.

18:41.775 --> 18:44.410
And if his brain
is affected too,

18:44.444 --> 18:46.846
then the artifact
could be putting him

18:46.880 --> 18:48.915
into permanent fight mode,

18:48.949 --> 18:51.251
which would make him
as much predator

18:51.285 --> 18:53.220
as his victims are prey.

18:53.254 --> 18:54.621
And look, I gotta go.

18:59.099 --> 19:00.561
Pete, why does Briggs have

19:00.596 --> 19:02.818
all of this info
on Helena?

19:06.664 --> 19:08.131
Hi, there.

19:08.471 --> 19:09.604
Ms. Lake around?

19:09.638 --> 19:11.573
Don't know yet.
You are...?

19:11.607 --> 19:12.573
Uh, we work together.

19:12.608 --> 19:14.742
Oh, my nephew takes karate.

19:14.776 --> 19:16.410
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

19:16.445 --> 19:18.279
And I've been repeatedly told
it's called kenpo.

19:19.515 --> 19:21.349
She can't be Emily's,
though, right?

19:21.384 --> 19:22.518
What's this about?

19:22.552 --> 19:24.953
I need to get a message
to her friends,

19:24.988 --> 19:26.021
the Secret Service agents.

19:26.055 --> 19:28.090
I figured
they knew each other.

19:28.124 --> 19:29.758
Her name isn't Emily Lake,
is it?

19:29.792 --> 19:30.892
What is she,
in Witness Protection?

19:30.927 --> 19:31.993
All right,
what are you talking about?

19:32.028 --> 19:34.762
You really don't know,
do you?

19:34.797 --> 19:36.131
Think about it.

19:36.165 --> 19:37.866
You need to get
off my property right now.

19:37.900 --> 19:38.867
Tell you what.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.636
You can deliver
the message for me.

19:43.739 --> 19:45.339
Now, you tell them
back off.

19:45.374 --> 19:47.842
Or I will find out
who she's hiding from,

19:47.876 --> 19:50.644
and ruin this
perfect little life of yours.

19:52.046 --> 19:53.146
Ugh!

19:53.181 --> 19:55.715
Agh!

19:55.749 --> 19:57.016
I assure you, Detective,

19:57.051 --> 19:58.384
you don't want to know
who I am.

19:58.419 --> 20:00.953
I count six ways
I could kill you right now.

20:00.988 --> 20:02.488
And the only reason
you're still drawing breath

20:02.523 --> 20:04.690
is because I'm trying so hard
not to do

20:04.725 --> 20:05.858
that sort of thing anymore.

20:05.893 --> 20:07.861
Check your boyfriend.

20:07.895 --> 20:10.230
Nate!

20:10.264 --> 20:11.965
Nate.

20:13.701 --> 20:16.070
It's gonna be okay.
Just take deep breaths.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.039
Myka! It's there.

20:19.073 --> 20:21.374
Put it in the bag, quick!

20:21.408 --> 20:22.975
Quickly, please.

20:27.046 --> 20:28.680
It's all right.
It's all right, honey.

20:35.987 --> 20:37.488
The Warehouse was designed

20:37.522 --> 20:39.523
to automatically expand
to accommodate

20:39.557 --> 20:41.191
the growing collection
of artifacts

20:41.226 --> 20:42.559
and their energies.

20:42.594 --> 20:44.328
That's why it was built
into the side of this mountain.

20:44.362 --> 20:45.896
And energy and matter
can be converted

20:45.930 --> 20:46.997
into each other, right?

20:47.032 --> 20:48.065
"E" equals "m-c" squared.

20:48.099 --> 20:49.700
So it's a self-sustaining
system.

20:49.735 --> 20:51.936
Exactly.
Einstein himself created

20:51.971 --> 20:53.972
those expansion joints.

20:54.007 --> 20:55.975
It sucks energy in.
Matter comes out.

20:56.009 --> 20:58.510
Oh, I get it,
so the jammed joints

20:58.545 --> 21:00.578
are filling with energy,

21:00.613 --> 21:02.380
and with nowhere
for the matter to go,

21:02.415 --> 21:05.450
the strain to expand
is what's causing the quakes.

21:05.484 --> 21:08.119
We need to stop
the flow of energy

21:08.154 --> 21:12.290
until we can figure out
why the joints are jammed.

21:12.325 --> 21:13.491
Right?

21:13.526 --> 21:15.393
Yeah, it's just,

21:15.427 --> 21:16.961
most people take a little longer
till they're comfortable

21:16.995 --> 21:18.596
speaking in "Freakanese."

21:18.630 --> 21:20.164
Yeah, but good for you,
Doctor.

21:20.198 --> 21:21.665
Good for you.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.300
Now, obviously, in here,

21:23.335 --> 21:24.768
artifact energy
is everywhere.

21:24.803 --> 21:26.303
We can't just throw a net
over the whole place.

21:26.338 --> 21:28.172
Well, so what if we found
a way to cover

21:28.206 --> 21:30.308
the joints with neutralizer?

21:30.342 --> 21:32.443
Create a barrier that the energy
can't get through.

21:32.478 --> 21:34.946
Yeah, just shoot some goo
up there.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.514
I'm so glad Pete's not here.

21:36.548 --> 21:38.916
Oh!

21:38.951 --> 21:40.084
Yeow!

21:40.118 --> 21:43.587
Wow! That's a great idea,
Jinksy.

21:43.622 --> 21:45.022
Let's go build us
a goo shooter.

21:45.057 --> 21:48.626
Look for something
in the Schoningen armory.

21:53.965 --> 21:55.499
So we need something
that will reach all the way

21:55.533 --> 21:56.800
to the ceiling...
and are you gonna tell me

21:56.834 --> 21:58.835
what's going on,
or what?

21:58.870 --> 22:02.039
Nothing.

22:02.073 --> 22:03.540
Just admiring from afar.

22:03.574 --> 22:05.907
That's the second time
that I've seen you get zapped.

22:05.953 --> 22:07.617
What's up?

22:09.647 --> 22:11.348
I think the Warehouse
is mad at me, okay?

22:11.382 --> 22:13.951
It's been giving me
these electric shots

22:13.985 --> 22:15.953
since we got back
from England.

22:15.988 --> 22:18.256
I think it's punishing me
because I stabbed

22:18.290 --> 22:19.357
its "husband" or whatever.

22:19.391 --> 22:20.759
So I figure,
probably safer to stay

22:20.793 --> 22:22.661
outside the explosives aisle,
you know.

22:22.695 --> 22:24.296
Why give the old lady
any ideas?

22:24.330 --> 22:27.199
Or maybe this isn't
about you,

22:27.234 --> 22:29.134
and it has something to do
with this expansion thing?

22:29.169 --> 22:30.402
- I...
- I'm sorry.

22:30.437 --> 22:33.038
Is your butt getting
joy-buzzered every two minutes?

22:33.073 --> 22:35.007
Is anyone else's?
Exactly.

22:35.042 --> 22:36.476
So I'm good back here.

22:36.510 --> 22:37.644
Okay, so tell Artie.

22:37.678 --> 22:39.479
With doctor head-shrinker
listening in?

22:39.513 --> 22:40.580
No, I don't think so.

22:40.614 --> 22:41.881
They have very strong meds
for people

22:41.916 --> 22:44.083
who think that buildings
hate them.

22:44.118 --> 22:45.485
Wait, wait, you're worried
about sounding crazy?

22:45.519 --> 22:47.587
In crazy town?

22:47.621 --> 22:49.289
See, I got locked up
for saying my brother

22:49.323 --> 22:50.590
was calling me
from another dimension.

22:50.624 --> 22:52.359
It didn't help I was right.

22:52.393 --> 22:54.961
You're lying.

22:54.996 --> 22:56.596
You're not afraid Abigail
will think you're crazy.

22:56.631 --> 22:59.266
It's something else.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.069
Oh! Oof.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.071
You see that?

23:05.106 --> 23:06.406
Why couldn't we
have needed something

23:06.440 --> 23:07.941
from the soft fabrics aisle?

23:09.577 --> 23:11.545
Jeez. What?

23:11.579 --> 23:12.780
You find anything yet?

23:12.814 --> 23:14.081
We are working on it.

23:14.116 --> 23:16.083
Well, hurry up,
because we figured out

23:16.118 --> 23:17.518
what's jamming the joints.

23:18.687 --> 23:20.354
That big nail
is doing all of this?

23:20.389 --> 23:21.923
That's not a big nail.
That's a spike.

23:21.957 --> 23:23.057
It's a very powerful spike.

23:23.092 --> 23:24.325
It's from the trans-continental
railway.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.896
It draws things together.

23:27.931 --> 23:30.966
Okay, so the artifact's
a jawbone.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.536
Best possible match
is this handsome devil,

23:33.570 --> 23:36.205
the giant prehistoric hyena.

23:36.239 --> 23:38.274
Favorite snack was...

23:38.308 --> 23:39.976
okay, well, us.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.911
It could be
that this guy's jawbone

23:41.946 --> 23:43.813
absorbed power
to put people

23:43.847 --> 23:45.748
in a state of primal fear.

23:45.783 --> 23:46.983
Look, you're saying words,

23:47.018 --> 23:48.919
but none of them
actually make any sense.

23:48.953 --> 23:49.953
I know, Nate.

23:49.987 --> 23:51.855
Look, you're not crazy, okay?

23:51.889 --> 23:52.889
We are.

23:52.924 --> 23:54.291
What do you people do?

23:54.325 --> 23:58.095
And Emily, I mean,
I thought I knew her.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.898
I want to believe
that I know her.

24:00.933 --> 24:02.333
I don't even know her name.

24:02.367 --> 24:03.601
She's lived in my house.

24:03.635 --> 24:04.668
She's been in my bed.

24:04.703 --> 24:06.403
I trusted her with Adelaide.

24:06.438 --> 24:08.139
I know, all right, all right.
Pull up.

24:08.173 --> 24:10.574
Pull up, okay?

24:10.608 --> 24:12.643
It's true.
She's not who you thought.

24:12.677 --> 24:13.744
Okay, but she... no, no.

24:13.779 --> 24:17.081
She is so much more.

24:17.115 --> 24:18.249
It's her place
to tell you, okay?

24:18.283 --> 24:19.250
Not mine.

24:19.284 --> 24:21.285
But what I can say is

24:21.320 --> 24:23.888
you don't need to be
afraid of her.

24:23.923 --> 24:25.690
And no one
that I have ever met

24:25.724 --> 24:29.227
will protect you
or your daughter any better.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.595
Protect us from what?

24:30.629 --> 24:32.264
If we're so safe,
why couldn't she tell me

24:32.298 --> 24:33.264
her real name?

24:35.334 --> 24:38.503
Every time
the Warehouse and I mix,

24:38.537 --> 24:40.939
lives are ruined.

24:40.973 --> 24:43.809
It's over.

24:43.843 --> 24:47.112
Don't you find it strange
that you became attached

24:47.146 --> 24:49.280
so quickly to a man
with a daughter

24:49.315 --> 24:50.715
around Christina's age?

24:50.749 --> 24:52.684
- Excuse me?
- Isn't it possible

24:52.718 --> 24:55.954
that a part of you still wants
to get Christina back?

24:55.988 --> 24:58.223
Myka, how could you suggest...

24:58.257 --> 25:00.492
this has got nothing to do
with my daughter.

25:00.526 --> 25:02.294
Helena, I'm sorry,

25:02.328 --> 25:03.495
but I can't help
but notice...

25:03.529 --> 25:05.263
You can take
your observational skills,

25:05.298 --> 25:06.565
and you can leave
right now.

25:06.599 --> 25:08.968
You are denying who you are
to chase a ghost.

25:10.237 --> 25:12.738
This life...
it's not who you are.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.373
What? No, no, no.

25:14.408 --> 25:17.142
No! Don't you hurt her!
Please.

25:17.177 --> 25:18.511
It's Briggs.

25:18.545 --> 25:19.712
He must've flashed
his badge

25:19.746 --> 25:20.880
at Adelaide's karate school

25:20.914 --> 25:23.082
and convinced them he was there
to pick her up.

25:23.116 --> 25:24.884
Just bring that thing
I left,

25:24.918 --> 25:26.719
and everything will be great.

25:26.753 --> 25:29.522
I'll text you and tell you
where to meet.

25:31.325 --> 25:34.294
Your dad says we can get
some ice cream.

25:34.328 --> 25:36.196
You work with Emily?

25:36.230 --> 25:38.565
Yep. She and your dad
are working late,

25:38.599 --> 25:41.101
so they asked me
to take care of you.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.136
I've got lots of homework,

25:43.170 --> 25:47.040
so when can I go home?

25:47.075 --> 25:48.972
That all depends
on Emily.

25:54.793 --> 25:56.035
No, I don't understand.

25:56.074 --> 25:57.472
Why aren't we getting help?

25:57.535 --> 25:58.601
We are the help, okay?

25:58.636 --> 26:00.069
We're experts.

26:00.104 --> 26:01.971
At what?
What are you an expert at?

26:02.006 --> 26:03.473
We'll get Adelaide back.

26:03.507 --> 26:04.474
Why should I trust you?

26:04.508 --> 26:05.709
Why should I trust
any of you?

26:05.743 --> 26:07.911
You're the ones
who took this thing from him.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.579
Just give it back.
Give it back to him.

26:09.614 --> 26:10.681
And you bring
my daughter home.

26:10.715 --> 26:12.234
- Nate, I...
- Don't.

26:13.748 --> 26:15.086
I'll talk to him.

26:18.189 --> 26:19.156
Helena...

26:19.190 --> 26:21.992
Myka, you...
you were right.

26:22.026 --> 26:23.260
You warned me.

26:23.295 --> 26:25.796
- About what?
- I can't have a normal life.

26:25.831 --> 26:28.266
I- I was being foolish.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.269
Selfish.

26:31.303 --> 26:32.571
How can I bring anything
but misery to...

26:32.605 --> 26:34.339
No, that isn't what I meant,
Helena.

26:34.374 --> 26:36.242
I know what I am.

26:36.276 --> 26:38.144
I can't just sit here.

26:38.178 --> 26:42.115
I know what I have to do.

26:53.795 --> 26:57.932
Who are you?

26:57.966 --> 26:59.533
I'll explain
when this is over.

27:02.404 --> 27:03.604
Hey! Hey, Myka!
Where are you going?

27:03.638 --> 27:04.939
I can handle Briggs.

27:04.973 --> 27:06.407
Just stay with Helena
and Nate

27:06.441 --> 27:07.775
and make sure
they don't follow me.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.743
No. No, what... what...
are you nuts?

27:09.777 --> 27:11.512
Just wait for us.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.614
This is my fault.
I dragged her into this.

27:13.648 --> 27:16.717
I'll get Adelaide back.
It'll be okay.

27:16.751 --> 27:18.385
Myk...

27:20.722 --> 27:22.422
Wait, Briggs.

27:22.457 --> 27:25.793
He was gonna text instructions
to your phone.

27:28.430 --> 27:30.030
She took the phone.

27:30.064 --> 27:33.133
And the artifact.

27:35.836 --> 27:37.704
So how'd it get up there?

27:37.738 --> 27:40.040
Well, the attraction
between the spike

27:40.074 --> 27:42.543
and that suddenly expanding
joint must've been so strong

27:42.577 --> 27:44.711
that the spike just shot
up to the ceiling.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.047
Probably the first time
that the Yukon sector

27:47.082 --> 27:48.582
has ever expanded.

27:48.617 --> 27:49.950
We found
an old RPG launcher

27:49.985 --> 27:51.719
and pressure-loaded the shells
with neutralizer.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.655
Behold the gazooka.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.190
Turning into the goo queen.
You know that, right?

27:56.225 --> 27:58.593
It'll neutralize anything
within a 20-foot blast radius.

27:58.627 --> 27:59.694
Look, look, look.

27:59.728 --> 28:01.114
You're gonna have to be
really quick.

28:01.151 --> 28:02.052
As you may recall,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.333
Einstein's whole mass-energy
conversion thing,

28:04.388 --> 28:07.034
that's what makes
nuclear bombs go boom.

28:18.712 --> 28:21.714
Crap. I was so proud
of that thing.

28:21.749 --> 28:22.715
That's why you make two.

28:22.749 --> 28:23.916
I need higher ground.

28:23.951 --> 28:25.407
Okay, follow me.

28:30.256 --> 28:33.092
Roy Frances dived in platform
for 40 years.

28:33.126 --> 28:36.128
Frances dived off that thing
into a shallow pool of water.

28:36.163 --> 28:38.163
Jeez, if you ever tell me
Cirque Du Soleil uses artifacts,

28:38.198 --> 28:39.632
I'll never forgive you.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.267
Now, be careful, because this
ladder's a death trap.

28:41.301 --> 28:42.501
Well, don't sugarcoat it
for me.

28:42.536 --> 28:45.504
Go!

28:58.551 --> 29:01.520
Careful!

29:09.528 --> 29:11.630
Oh, oh... whoa!

29:11.664 --> 29:15.433
Oh!

29:15.468 --> 29:19.805
Whoa!

29:19.839 --> 29:21.173
Agh. I'm okay.

29:21.207 --> 29:24.810
Oh, but no...
I'm not okay.

29:24.844 --> 29:25.944
Artie.

29:25.978 --> 29:27.312
It's swelling up fast.

29:27.347 --> 29:29.448
- Steve...
- I'm fine!

29:29.482 --> 29:31.817
Look, I'll find a way down
and help Artie.

29:31.852 --> 29:33.586
You two, you're
gonna have to get closer.

29:33.620 --> 29:34.920
You're gonna have to get
right under that spike

29:34.955 --> 29:35.921
and try again.

29:35.956 --> 29:36.956
Just go!

29:36.990 --> 29:40.259
This thing is getting bigger!

29:40.294 --> 29:43.597
I guess it's just
you and me.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.346
She lost someone,
didn't she?

29:59.380 --> 30:01.347
Her daughter.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.649
Knew it when I met her.

30:02.683 --> 30:03.983
I think it's what
drew me to her.

30:04.018 --> 30:06.786
Adelaide and I,
we know what loss looks like.

30:06.821 --> 30:08.855
We're going to find
your daughter, Nate.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.056
Now.

30:10.090 --> 30:11.858
He has to have a place
near the police station.

30:11.892 --> 30:13.860
Right? Because Purcell,

30:13.894 --> 30:16.128
he was still evolving
when he ran in,

30:16.163 --> 30:17.730
and we think
that this jawbone

30:17.764 --> 30:19.365
made Briggs act
like the predator

30:19.399 --> 30:22.034
that it came from.

30:22.068 --> 30:25.404
Which is...

30:25.439 --> 30:27.340
why I'm studying hyenas.

30:27.374 --> 30:28.474
Okay, what's she doing?

30:28.509 --> 30:29.575
Looking for clues?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.010
That's what she does.

30:31.044 --> 30:33.179
Makes more sense
than what you said.

30:42.323 --> 30:43.489
Nate.

30:43.524 --> 30:45.358
I'm so sorry.
I- I-I promise you that.

30:45.392 --> 30:46.593
Find anything?

30:46.627 --> 30:48.194
Yeah, yeah.

30:48.229 --> 30:50.830
I have, uh, a shoe print,

30:50.864 --> 30:52.398
um, from a hiking shoe,

30:52.433 --> 30:55.202
and from the lack of wear,
I'd say they're brand new.

30:55.236 --> 30:57.771
Not sure what... oh, hello.

30:57.806 --> 31:00.607
Yeah, it's a price tag.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.809
There's no store name.

31:02.844 --> 31:03.944
Hiking?

31:03.978 --> 31:05.245
Near the station.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.547
What?

31:06.581 --> 31:07.548
Pete said
he might have a place

31:07.582 --> 31:08.682
near the station.

31:08.717 --> 31:10.117
There's a camping goods store
there.

31:10.152 --> 31:11.252
I pass it when I drop you off
at work.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.253
It just went
out of business.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.788
Well done, Nate.

31:13.822 --> 31:16.090
We think we know
where he took her.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.092
- Crap.
- What is it?

31:18.126 --> 31:19.126
Hyenas.

31:19.161 --> 31:20.261
They hunt in packs, right?

31:20.295 --> 31:22.396
One lures the prey
into the trap,

31:22.430 --> 31:24.064
where the other
is waiting to attack.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.699
That's how Briggs got back
to the police station

31:25.733 --> 31:26.700
before Purcell.

31:26.734 --> 31:28.301
Briggs isn't working alone.

31:28.336 --> 31:29.302
He's got a partner.

31:29.337 --> 31:31.271
And Myka doesn't know that.

31:45.485 --> 31:48.453
Detective, I have
the jawbone.

31:50.689 --> 31:53.591
Look, I don't want
any trouble.

31:53.625 --> 31:56.560
Okay?

31:56.595 --> 31:59.563
I just want to take
Adelaide home.

32:02.184 --> 32:04.623
Reach for your gun slowly.

32:08.851 --> 32:10.443
And slide it over to me.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.423
Look, you have
what you want.

32:22.457 --> 32:24.285
Let Adelaide go.

32:31.144 --> 32:32.634
You're the one
who killed Shultz.

32:32.669 --> 32:35.004
Shultz died
of a heart attack.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.806
But he was just another loser

32:36.840 --> 32:39.509
making this city
a dangerous place

32:39.543 --> 32:40.676
to live in.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.546
You don't care.
You don't live here.

32:42.580 --> 32:45.700
Good people afraid to leave
their houses at night,

32:45.817 --> 32:48.519
while killers get off
on technicalities.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.022
This let us do something
about it!

32:51.056 --> 32:52.991
That has turned you int...

32:53.025 --> 32:56.528
Look, I'm just here
for Adelaide.

32:56.562 --> 32:58.229
She's just a kid.

32:58.264 --> 33:00.732
She's not a part of this,
so just let her go.

33:00.766 --> 33:02.900
No, you will try
and stop us.

33:02.935 --> 33:05.062
I- I can't let
either of you go.

33:07.573 --> 33:09.507
You didn't know that that
was a part of the plan, did you?

33:09.541 --> 33:11.242
Listen to me, Briggs, okay?

33:11.297 --> 33:13.211
That jawbone, it messes
with your head, okay?

33:13.245 --> 33:14.345
It makes you do things.

33:14.379 --> 33:16.180
You used to be a good cop.
I can tell.

33:16.214 --> 33:17.548
I'm still a good cop.

33:17.582 --> 33:19.250
Good cops don't kill
little kids!

33:19.284 --> 33:22.086
- Shut up!
- Shultz was innocent too!

33:22.120 --> 33:23.788
Did you know that? Yeah.
He was arrested in another state

33:23.822 --> 33:25.055
on the night of the murder.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.391
He knows.
Ask him.

33:27.426 --> 33:28.392
Is that true?

33:28.426 --> 33:30.528
Shultz was guilty
of plenty

33:30.562 --> 33:31.829
we never caught him for.

33:31.863 --> 33:32.997
He got what he deserved.

33:33.031 --> 33:35.332
And when were you gonna tell
me all of that?

33:38.436 --> 33:41.438
Get her, or she'll burn
both of us!

33:50.147 --> 33:51.181
You're gonna
have to do this.

33:51.215 --> 33:53.049
What? No, no, no, no.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.017
I... look, I get
that you don't like me.

33:55.052 --> 33:57.120
- Why would you say that?
- Really?

33:57.154 --> 33:59.289
Okay, I know
why you say that.

33:59.323 --> 34:01.592
But I honestly think you'd be
safer in there than I would.

34:01.626 --> 34:04.728
Why?

34:04.763 --> 34:07.598
Because the Warehouse has been
electrocuting me for days,

34:07.632 --> 34:09.533
and if I go in there,
it'll kill me.

34:09.568 --> 34:11.503
Claudia, if the Warehouse
has been attacking you,

34:11.536 --> 34:14.973
why haven't you
told anybody?

34:16.208 --> 34:17.676
Because the Regents
won't make me caretaker

34:17.710 --> 34:18.777
if they find out.

34:18.811 --> 34:21.112
They think I have
this special connection

34:21.146 --> 34:22.146
to the Warehouse,

34:22.181 --> 34:23.414
but how can I have
a connection

34:23.449 --> 34:24.815
if the Warehouse hates me?

34:24.850 --> 34:27.918
And I just barely realized

34:27.952 --> 34:29.085
I want to be caretaker.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.320
I want it a lot.

34:30.355 --> 34:31.822
And I couldn't tell Artie
with you around

34:31.856 --> 34:33.456
because you work
for the Regents.

34:33.491 --> 34:34.690
It's your job to tell them
what you think of us.

34:34.726 --> 34:36.527
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there,

34:36.561 --> 34:40.163
because clearly,
we don't have a lot of time.

34:40.197 --> 34:42.264
First, I am not a snitch.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.835
Second, if you have
this special connection,

34:44.869 --> 34:46.603
did you ever consider
that maybe the Warehouse

34:46.637 --> 34:49.840
is trying to get
your attention?

34:49.873 --> 34:51.440
And maybe zapping you
is its way

34:51.475 --> 34:53.141
of asking you for help.

34:53.177 --> 34:54.777
You really think
that's it?

34:54.812 --> 34:56.146
How the hell do I know?

34:56.179 --> 34:58.248
But if you want to be
the caretaker so badly,

34:58.283 --> 35:01.485
go care-take!

35:20.132 --> 35:21.696
All right!

35:21.731 --> 35:25.465
You wanted my attention?
You got it.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.599
You want my help?

35:27.634 --> 35:30.835
Then let me in!

35:30.870 --> 35:33.969
Otherwise, if you want
to kill me,

35:34.003 --> 35:37.003
here's your chance.

36:05.064 --> 36:07.999
Well, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

37:07.055 --> 37:09.590
Now, that's a caretaker.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.794
<i>I'm gonna need
a Silkwood shower.</i>

37:29.277 --> 37:31.445
Briggs is mine.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.747
Hey, hey.

37:32.781 --> 37:33.982
No killing.

37:34.016 --> 37:35.183
Myka will be super pissed.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.339
It's over, Hofgren.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.741
I said it's over!

37:56.775 --> 38:01.646
Pete.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.756
I did warn you, Detective.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.357
Agh!

38:14.027 --> 38:15.327
Myka. Are you okay?

38:15.362 --> 38:16.462
I'm all right.

38:16.496 --> 38:18.564
Listen, Adelaide
is in the back room.

38:18.599 --> 38:19.866
Yeah, I think that you should be
the one to go get her.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.369
Take care of this
for me, will you?

38:22.403 --> 38:24.872
Good luck.

38:32.580 --> 38:33.713
- Agh!
- Ugh!

38:33.747 --> 38:36.649
No!

39:02.577 --> 39:03.644
No caveman jokes.

39:03.678 --> 39:05.179
I will not agree to that.

39:05.213 --> 39:08.216
Oh, come on.

39:18.733 --> 39:19.701
Adelaide?

39:19.735 --> 39:21.204
- Emily!
- Oh!

39:21.238 --> 39:23.940
Come here.

39:23.975 --> 39:25.510
- Oh.
- God.

39:25.544 --> 39:29.014
Bravo, my girl.
Bravo.

39:29.049 --> 39:31.716
Exactly as I would have done.

39:33.423 --> 39:35.891
And my name is Helena.

39:47.577 --> 39:48.881
What made you think
the Warehouse

39:48.920 --> 39:50.712
was trying to get
my attention?

39:50.747 --> 39:52.214
Something Artie told me
about Leena,

39:52.248 --> 39:55.350
that she "spoke Warehouse."

39:55.385 --> 39:58.354
Thought maybe it was
trying to talk to you.

40:00.758 --> 40:02.224
You haven't had
much positive experience

40:02.259 --> 40:04.993
with therapy, have you?

40:05.028 --> 40:06.762
When I got
electroshock therapy,

40:06.796 --> 40:08.730
one of the gator clips
was marked positive.

40:08.764 --> 40:09.731
That count?

40:09.765 --> 40:11.799
I only use those
on my car.

40:12.868 --> 40:15.003
Look, I'm here to help.
Or not.

40:15.037 --> 40:16.327
Up to you.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.443
Hey, crazy question.

40:22.478 --> 40:25.046
What... what kind of shampoo
do you use?

40:25.081 --> 40:26.982
Nothing special.
Why?

40:28.552 --> 40:31.453
Weird.
Thought I smelled apples.

40:31.487 --> 40:34.022
So is anyone gonna get me
down from here?

40:34.056 --> 40:36.358
Oh, my God,
that's my best friend.

40:42.999 --> 40:45.600
Everybody seems okay.

40:45.635 --> 40:48.036
Well, Adelaide's safe.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.471
That's the main thing.

40:50.506 --> 40:53.641
As for Nate and myself...

40:53.675 --> 40:55.143
Who knows?

40:55.177 --> 40:57.645
Right, well,
good luck, okay?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.381
'Cause I really want
to believe

40:59.415 --> 41:02.016
there's an alternate Warehouse
retirement plan.

41:02.051 --> 41:03.818
So, you know,
get in there

41:03.852 --> 41:05.586
and book a win
for all of us.

41:05.621 --> 41:07.989
I will do my very best
not to let you down.

41:08.023 --> 41:09.691
Counting on you.

41:15.131 --> 41:16.264
So is this good-bye?

41:16.299 --> 41:19.268
Well, I would assume not.

41:24.001 --> 41:25.535
Fight for him.

41:25.564 --> 41:27.142
I was wrong when I said
that you weren't being

41:27.177 --> 41:28.511
true to yourself.

41:28.545 --> 41:31.881
Maybe I was just afraid
of losing a friend.

41:31.915 --> 41:33.583
But caring for someone...

41:33.617 --> 41:36.386
you're obviously
very good at it,

41:36.420 --> 41:38.688
so make this...

41:38.722 --> 41:40.518
make this your home.

41:43.327 --> 41:45.895
Thank you.

41:45.929 --> 41:48.865
And... and you will never lose
this friend.

41:48.899 --> 41:52.535
Good.

41:57.574 --> 42:00.709
So I guess
I will see you around.

42:00.744 --> 42:03.946
- Until then.
- Right.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.014
Ugh.

42:08.118 --> 42:11.153
Maybe just coffee
next time.

42:11.187 --> 42:13.989
Or save the world.

42:14.023 --> 42:15.657
See what happens.
