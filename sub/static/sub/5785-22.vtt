BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.208
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.386 --> 00:13.048
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.222 --> 00:16.089
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.762
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.936 --> 00:21.894
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.393

fast enough to stop them.

is the Speed Foroe.

-Say, Iris, you look amazing.
-Thanks, Tony.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.448
His skin changed. It turned to metal.

00:41.626 --> 00:44.538
Tony might have been a bully.
but he didn't deserve to die.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.291
Bany, you've always had
someone to come home to.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.252
I can't help but wonder. maybe,
we were meant to be together.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.384
-You lost your powers?
-I gave them up to save Wally.

to get you your speed back.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.315

05:36.879 --> 05:38.835
How much do you know
about the Speed Force?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.588
It's the source of my power.

I'm talking to the Speed Force?

06:26.637 --> 06:27.626
You need a minute?

06:29.765 --> 06:30.800

Well, Wells brought him here.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.756
Are there any records of that treatment?

No, the Breach Room

29:17.089 --> 29:18.875
All right, look, if it's me that he wants.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.332
-I'II just lead him away.
-No, you won't.
