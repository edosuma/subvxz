18:56.703 --> 18:58.204
What are you talking about?

18:58.238 --> 19:00.273
I bet you're better than me
at some stuff.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.742
Like what?
I don't know.

19:02.776 --> 19:03.877
Uh-huh.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.478
But you're still my big brother.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.347
Yeah, but you're bigger
than I am.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.783
Yeah, but every time
Mom and Dad leave the house,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.484
they always put you
in charge.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.853
I wish I could be
in charge.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.522
That's just
a lot of work.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.757
So? Plus, you get
to go to school

19:17.791 --> 19:19.592
all the way
in Brooklyn Beach.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.462
I wish I could ride the bus
to school every day.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.398
You do?
Yeah! That's so cool.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.500
Everybody in my class
is always asking me

19:27.534 --> 19:29.636
what it's like
at your school.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.372
You're the coolest big brother
out of all my friends.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.708
<i>It never occurred to me</i>
<i>that even though Drew</i>

19:34.741 --> 19:37.377
<i>was bigger and cooler,</i>
<i>and better with girls,</i>

19:37.410 --> 19:41.314
<i>the coolest thing to him</i>
<i>was that he had me.</i>

19:41.348 --> 19:44.651
Hey, Chris,
can you show me that move?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.986
I'll try.

19:47.821 --> 19:49.255
[SIGHING]
Just...

19:49.289 --> 19:52.425
it might not work,
because I've had training.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.928
So basically, you take
your opponent's hand and...

19:54.961 --> 19:56.262
Oh, I think I got it.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.398
[SHOUTING]

20:00.066 --> 20:02.035
[SCREAMING]

20:02.068 --> 20:06.439
<i>* Everybody hates Chris </i>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.576

20:11.511 --> 20:13.747
<i>* Aw, make it funky now </i>
