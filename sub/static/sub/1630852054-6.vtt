<i>Karma means
you cannot escape your sins.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:31.132
They'll always catch up to you.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.199
Dru!

00:32.233 --> 00:33.334
<i>Two of Zeke's professors</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:34.702
<i>asked me about what happened that night.</i>

00:34.735 --> 00:35.770
What'd you say about me?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.571
I may have mentioned your name.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.774
Dru, he's still fucking
that nigga that dropped him

00:39.807 --> 00:41.242
<i>and Zeke's name to the school.</i>

00:44.345 --> 00:45.613
Cane, he come around here, asking for me?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.448
<i>- Or anything like that?</i>
- No, why?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.750
You can protect Tariq by getting more info

00:49.784 --> 00:52.486
<i>on Brayden and everything
he knows onto the wire.</i>

00:52.520 --> 00:54.422
Don't forget, son,
you're my soldier.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.358
<i>I did what I had to do</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:58.559
to get through to him.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.728
We'll absolutely reach out
to you and your mother.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.329
Uh, no, she doesn't need to know.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.566
I go to open the safe,
and the fuckin' money is gone.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.134
My guys didn't break into your safe!

01:07.768 --> 01:09.403
Any of y'all
know anything about this?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.638
So you really got Zeke off?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.573
The cops have new evidence.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.276
<i>Tariq St. Patrick,
you're under arrest.</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:17.611
<i>Looks like justice caught up
to you, young brother.</i>

01:17.645 --> 01:19.246
<i>What is this?</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:20.848
<i>I was supposed to give
it to you in the event</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:22.550
<i>that you were arrested for homicide.</i>

01:22.583 --> 01:25.419
I could set up your kids. Not just Zeke.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.896
Hey, Diana, how'd you pull this off?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.764
Me? Nah, it was--

03:50.798 --> 03:51.865
it was all the lawyer.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.635
How'd a little girl like you
pay for a lawyer?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.236
I know how to hustle.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.406
Ah...damn, 'Renzo,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.609
you raised a boss.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.544
What's good?

04:04.278 --> 04:05.779

04:10.684 --> 04:12.252
It's a private party.
Y'all weren't invited.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.354
You need to be somewhere else.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.356
Auntie Monet said it was
cool if I bring my boys.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.757
My bad.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.459
Babe, you remember
my nephew, Zeke.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.260
It's been a while
since you might've seen him.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.563
Actually, no, babe,
I don't think we ever met.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.565
Zeke, I hope you realize

04:24.598 --> 04:27.501
how much my wife has done for you, nephew.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.036
Kino.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.704
Oh, wow. Wow.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.740
It's nothing personal.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.811
Enjoy the party, right?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.953
- Papi.
- What's up?

04:45.986 --> 04:49.356
Lil Guap here wants to take
a picture with you for his IG.

04:51.025 --> 04:53.761
You know your father was
all about the business, mijo.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.800
Whoa, just my keys.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.903
<i>Start using your head, man.</i>

05:02.936 --> 05:05.305

05:23.323 --> 05:25.092
Oh, Carlito.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.395
My son Dru right here.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.364
This the one I've been
telling you about, Kino.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.399
He's ahead of his time right here.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.802
<i>He'll be running the city when I'm gone.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:37.337
Still got a lot of time before that, Papi.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.406
You're early.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.478

06:14.007 --> 06:15.609
You rode with 'Renzo inside, right?

06:15.642 --> 06:17.010
How come you ain't come see us

06:17.044 --> 06:18.545
when you got out couple of months back?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.813
Got my own work out here.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.081
My own peoples.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.649
Come on, pour some shots.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.518
We're on the bag up with Kino.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.520
And where my cigars?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.456
You know I can't stand
them stinking ass cigars.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.758
You not smoking in here.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.761
I'll smoke
when I want in my house.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.496
<i>And y'all ran out of chicken.</i>

06:35.529 --> 06:37.397
Can you bring another pan, please?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.499
Ma, you need some help?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.967
Nah, she got it, <i>mamita.</i> It's all good.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.602
So listen, when we find our groove,

06:41.635 --> 06:44.071
we start moving product again, right...

06:44.104 --> 06:46.774
we're gonna run shit
the same way we did up north.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.110
Sixty percent for me,
forty percent for you.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.079
We're not locked up anymore, 'Renzo.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.747
I'm doin' my own thing now.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.982
Bullshit.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.051
Who you running for, man?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.686
Broad Street Killers.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.722
<i>I heard the Feds did a sweep of BSK.</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:03.524
Got almost everybody.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.794
Now I'm in charge
until the big homie gets out.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.562
The same BSK niggas

07:08.595 --> 07:10.030
I had to protect you from in prison.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.932
That's who you choose to roll
with when you're free?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.168
I gotta run my own thing, 'Renzo.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.104
Looks like you already know
who you want riding shotgun.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.974
I'll holla at you.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.785
What's up with Papi?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.821
Why's he playing Dru so close?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.859
<i>Cane, not now.</i>

07:47.034 --> 07:50.003
Dru, I left some bottles
of wine in the garage.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.572
Can you grab 'em for me?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.607
- I got you.
- Thank you.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.752
Yo, man, your cousin Zeke
kept on starin' at me earlier,

08:05.786 --> 08:07.654
and Dru looks like
he feels a way too, man.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.489
That's why I gotta holler at your pops.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.891
I gotta let him know that all that shit

08:10.924 --> 08:12.759
that went down with Dru
is behind us now.

08:12.793 --> 08:13.961
Relax, okay? Lorenzo, don't give a fuck

08:13.994 --> 08:15.629
about Zeke or anybody else.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.564
He only cares about making his comeback.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.566
We good.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.672
You know who I am?

08:25.706 --> 08:26.807
You're Zeke's aunt, right?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.076
Don't play dumb, nigga. I'm Dru's mother.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.512
I know who you are,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.514
and you're not ready for my son.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.682
I don't know where you're going with this.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.084
Look, you and your big mouth

08:37.117 --> 08:38.785
are not welcome in here.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.188
Get the fuck outta my house.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.091
He ain't coming back.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.300
<i>Remember when I used to go out,</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:54.801
<i>get that bread,</i>

08:54.835 --> 08:57.271
you'd be in the crib
holding it down with the kids?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.206
We come a long way from those days.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.807
These past ten years,

09:00.841 --> 09:03.143
I kept the business goin' out here alone.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.245
That's why I'm gonna make sure

09:05.279 --> 09:07.180
you'll never have to
put in that work again.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.549
How? By making our kids do my work?

09:09.583 --> 09:12.719
I saw you playin' Dru
real close last night.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.122
He's ready, Mo.
He just doesn't know it yet.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.258
I wanna hand what we built down to Dru.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.993
You've been inside for ten years.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.561
How the hell you know who Dru is?

09:21.595 --> 09:23.730
I tell you what I do know.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.933
Diana belongs in the classroom
and boardrooms,

09:25.966 --> 09:28.635
not the fucking block.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.271
And I think Cane, as long as the streets

09:31.305 --> 09:34.207
respect him or fear him, whatever,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.176
he'll be happy with his position.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.145
Dru's the one.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.880
He's the best of both.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.114
He has a cool head.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.584
He can build, he makes the right decisions

09:44.618 --> 09:46.119
and he can handle himself in the streets.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.288
Dru's got a weakness you don't know about.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.756
You better talk to him,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.658
make sure he chooses
what's good for the family

09:51.692 --> 09:53.093
rather than his heart.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.628
I peeped him last night.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.330
I saw him scopin' one of them ball players

09:56.363 --> 09:59.366
that came in with Zeke. I know who he is.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.070
Are they fuckin' around?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.138
You know everything.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.040
Welcome home, Papi.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.242
- Oh, wow.
- Yep.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.878
And I put extra blueberries
in your waffles too.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.313
Just the way I like it.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.649
- I know.
- So only Papi get breakfast?

10:15.682 --> 10:17.951
It's his welcome home breakfast, Ma.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.053
<i>I didn't think you were hungry.</i>

10:20.087 --> 10:22.622
Welcome home, Papi.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.825
Brought your clothes out
the garage, Pops, but, um...

10:24.858 --> 10:27.060
Yeah, but, uh, you can't rock
any of this shit.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.296
Don't trip 'cause I got drip for you.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.365
I'd rather do another bid than throw on

10:31.398 --> 10:33.667
any of them funny looking
outfits you be rockin'.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.868
<i>Ooh!</i>

10:34.901 --> 10:35.902
- Funny looking.
- Wow.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.070
Funny looking.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.939
I need to go to the Ave,
so you and your brother,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.040
you're riding with me.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.875
Shit, I guess I'm down.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.677
Yeah, I'm with it.

10:43.710 --> 10:47.014
I never knew days like this
would ever come again--

10:47.047 --> 10:51.084
reunited with my beautiful wife,

10:51.118 --> 10:52.886
<i>my kids.</i>

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
I'm gonna make some mofongo.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.426
Ooh! <i>- We're gonna have dinner</i>

10:59.659 --> 11:01.828
just like we used to
every Sunday before I went in.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.331
Everything-- everything is gonna be

11:04.364 --> 11:09.336
just the way it used to be. I promise.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.272
<i>People versus</i>

11:12.305 --> 11:13.874
<i>Tariq St. Patrick, Your Honor.</i>

11:13.907 --> 11:17.077
<i>Charges are two counts
of murder in the first degree.</i>

11:17.110 --> 11:19.079
<i>How does your client plead?</i>

11:19.112 --> 11:21.381
Not guilty, Your Honor.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.816
<i>Applications?</i>

11:22.849 --> 11:25.185
Your Honor, these are
two cold-blooded murders.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.121
One victim is the defendant's
college professor

11:28.155 --> 11:29.790
<i>and one a New York City police officer.</i>

11:29.823 --> 11:31.725
<i>No amount of bail would be appropriate.</i>

11:31.758 --> 11:33.193
Your Honor, these charges
are not only ridiculous,

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
but desperate.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.197
They just had another Black student

11:37.230 --> 11:39.699
under suspicion of these murders.

11:39.733 --> 11:43.036
They can't figure out which
Black man they want to charge.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.906
They can barely tie our client
to these killings.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.174
"Barely"?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.109
Mr. St. Patrick was engaged

11:49.142 --> 11:50.343
<i>in a criminal enterprise</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:52.112
<i>on the Stansfield University campus.</i>

11:52.145 --> 11:53.346
His professor, Jabari Reynolds,

11:53.380 --> 11:54.948
discovered his criminal activity.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.450
What criminal activity?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.852
And does she have
any proof of any of this?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.454
<i>Reynolds was killed with a weapon</i>

12:00.487 --> 12:02.823
belonging to Detective Danilo Ramirez

12:02.856 --> 12:04.758
who we found murdered by that same weapon.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.960
Your Honor, the People have no evidence

12:06.993 --> 12:08.962
our client even knew Detective Ramirez.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.164
We found Ramirez's NYPD shield

12:11.198 --> 12:12.799
<i>in the defendant's dorm room, Your Honor.</i>

12:12.833 --> 12:14.301
Your Honor, I'm being
framed for this, all right?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.470
- I don't know no Ramirez.
- Shut up.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.938
Sit down.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.339
Forgive our client, Your Honor.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.108
<i>Based on his criminal activity</i>

12:21.141 --> 12:23.810
we believe Mr. St. Patrick
has access to funds

12:23.844 --> 12:25.779
and is a tremendous flight risk.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.148
He has extensive ties
to the community, Your Honor.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.816
Such extensive ties that literally no one

12:29.850 --> 12:32.419
<i>showed up for him today?</i>

12:32.452 --> 12:34.187
<i>Your Honor, we request remand.</i>

12:34.221 --> 12:35.856
<i>Your Honor, if I may interject--</i>

12:35.889 --> 12:38.024
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. MacLean,
I don't have a choice.</i>

12:38.058 --> 12:40.527
The defendant is remanded without bail.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.829
<i>He'll be held over for motions in trial.</i>

12:46.500 --> 12:49.069
They like to make
examples out of cop killers.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.337
So what happened to my sister?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.006
I know they gave me custody,
but what's going on?

12:53.039 --> 12:54.841
They put her back in the system, Tariq.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.009
Foster care.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.011
Y'all gotta get me
the fuck outta here ASAP.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.813
Well, you- you heard the judge.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.015
Getting you bail won't be easy.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.251
I'm thinking illegal search of your room,

13:04.284 --> 13:05.452
get the badge thrown out.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.187
I didn't even know this Ramirez nigga.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.555
Somebody's framing me for this shit.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.557
If I were a judge,
I would never grant you bail.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.392
Well, I didn't kill
the fuckin' cop, a'ight?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.094
Okay, enough.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.029
I'm just sayin' what they're thinking.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.131
Well, he is right about one thing.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.534
Any judge we approach will
be under tremendous pressure

13:20.567 --> 13:24.037
to keep you inside because of Ramirez.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.438
However,

13:25.472 --> 13:28.074
there are appellate judges
who can be persuaded

13:28.108 --> 13:30.977
to make certain allowances

13:31.011 --> 13:33.413
with the right influence.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.217
Right, so get Rashad Tate
in here to speak to me

13:37.250 --> 13:40.053
- and I'll take it from there.
- Done.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.058
This is where I fell after I got hit.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.227
And I felt this, like...

13:49.229 --> 13:51.498
This heat.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.333
Yeah, burns, man.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.170
Hurts physically,
but nobody ever tells you

13:57.204 --> 13:59.172
how much getting shot
fucks with your head.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.043
How you doin' now?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.254
Oh, shit.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.189
Welcome home, Papi.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.991
Looks like the Jesus piece I used to rock

14:18.024 --> 14:20.227
- before I went up north.
- <i>It is.</i>

14:20.260 --> 14:22.862
Had a jeweler give it
a little upgrade for you.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.603
A real welcome home gift

14:29.636 --> 14:32.372
would've been a proper
introduction to that connect.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.341
Make that happen.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.510
Me and Dru are ready when he is.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.081
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make that happen.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.616
See what I can do.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.384
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.553
Don't you have a phone? Call him.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.622
Hit him up now.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.890
I need a minute with Dru anyway.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.005
Papi, I don't need
to meet the plug, all right?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.573
As long as you and Ma are here,

15:06.606 --> 15:08.241
I ain't gotta worry about all that.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.944
Anything can happen, Dru.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.246
Same as the moment you got shot.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.317
I'm trying to give you this game

15:17.350 --> 15:18.618
so you can sustain

15:18.652 --> 15:20.920
and put Diana and Cane in position

15:20.954 --> 15:23.923
so you can run this shit.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.393
You were moving
sloppy last night.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
There's no time
for distractions, Dru,

15:28.295 --> 15:31.398
especially for civilians in this game.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.000
I've been asking around about Kino.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.335
Word on the street is

15:35.368 --> 15:37.037
he's over-working all them BSK niggas

15:37.070 --> 15:39.506
and paying 'em scraps.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.708
- We can recruit his men.
- Smart.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.710
But when word gets out
that we stealing his men,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.011
it may start a war.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.714
Kino sounds like a threat.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.483
Maybe you need to eliminate the threat.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.319
Big move.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.587
But I like where your head is at.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.324
So we need to make sure his
number two is on board with it.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.729
Stay focused,
make every fucking move count.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.732
There's gonna be a lotta eyes
on you now, Dru.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.168
You gotta make the right call.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.437
And you can only trust the right people.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.638
Even outside the game?

16:11.671 --> 16:14.240
There's no such thing.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.546
Why you ain't tell me
your father was gettin' out?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.548
Because Papi told me not to.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.117
I guess he didn't wanna get your hopes up.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.052
Uh-huh.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.021
He told you to steal from me too?

16:28.054 --> 16:30.590
Ma, I did what I had to do
to bring our family together.

16:30.623 --> 16:31.725
What you should be doin'

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
is thankin' me for bringing him home.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.496
I killed a man for that money, Diana.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.065
And I ain't tell you to do that.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.468
You acting real fuckin'
reckless around here.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.003
You don't know who
you fucking with, little girl.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.639
I got your husband outta jail
and I'm fuckin' wit' you?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.308
You shut the fuck up.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.643
What, is there some reason
you don't want Papi home?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.712
Get the fuck outta my house

16:52.746 --> 16:55.048
<i>before I kill you in here.</i>

17:04.157 --> 17:06.559
How the fuck I let this nigga
Cane do this shit to me?

17:06.593 --> 17:08.395
<i>You gon' take
the weight for all that shit.</i>

17:08.428 --> 17:10.096
Ramirez, the professor--

17:10.130 --> 17:11.731
all that shit's gonna be
on your fuckin' ass.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.472
<i>Nah, nigga, you lookin'
at this shit all wrong.</i>

17:19.506 --> 17:21.307
You think Cane is the problem.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.576
Yeah, when I get out, I'm goin'
straight at that nigga.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.278
The damage is done.

17:25.311 --> 17:28.047
You can't out-gun him now.
Twelve gonna be on you.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.816
Tch. I'll outsmart them like I always do.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.288
You sound funny sitting here
talkin' about outsmarting 12.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.558
<i>You so focused on goin' to war with Cane,</i>

17:38.591 --> 17:39.826
<i>that you don't see the whole board.</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:41.294
That nigga
ain't trollin' the op.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.596
Who else helped him pull this off?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.698
Cane is a shooter,
but he ain't much of a thinker.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.267
Who controllin' the nigga moves?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.235
<i>Someone had to
put this plan in his head</i>

17:49.269 --> 17:50.837
<i>- and he's just executin'.</i>
- Who telling him what to do?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.272
Who was telling you what to do

17:52.305 --> 17:53.673
<i>before you sent that ass to Arizona?</i>

17:57.243 --> 17:59.546
Fuck, you're right!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.115
It's fucking Monet.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.083
She got this nigga Cane
on a fucking leash.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.618
I got bullets for her. No, matter of fact,

18:05.652 --> 18:08.621
I got bullets for the whole
Tejada family when I get out.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.290
D<i>on't even
have proof it was them.</i>

18:10.323 --> 18:12.692
Anybody could've crossed you.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.595
You know, sometimes it's
the ones you love the most.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.671
<i>Lauren.</i>

18:24.704 --> 18:26.339
Why did the police arrest Tariq?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.575
Lauren, I'm sorry, you're upset.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.477
But you have to accept that your boyfriend

18:30.510 --> 18:32.145
is a cold-blooded murderer.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.580
How do you know that he's guilty?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.682
Did the police use something
from this wire that I wore?

18:35.715 --> 18:37.283
Are they gonna make me
testify against him?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.552
Because I can't do that.
Tariq is gonna hate me.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.823
Some key pieces were captured on the wire.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.425
They will call you in

18:45.458 --> 18:48.661
because you're a very important
part of the investigation,

18:48.695 --> 18:50.563
but you're not the only
evidence against him.

18:50.597 --> 18:54.167
So you knew this whole time
that Tariq was the target.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.902
You lied to me?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.505
We can't do this here.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.306
Hey, Lauren.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.144
All right.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.315
Afternoon, good people.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.419
Is freedom an illusion?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.588
Um, are y'all for real right now?

19:15.622 --> 19:16.856
<i>I can't just sit back and debate this</i>

19:16.890 --> 19:18.525
<i>like this is any other day.</i>

19:18.558 --> 19:20.527
You know who's not free? Tariq.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.295
<i>Right? Can you believe</i>

19:22.328 --> 19:24.564
that he shot Professor Reynolds and a cop?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.232
Allegedly.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.268
Fuck outta here with that "allegedly."

19:28.301 --> 19:30.203
They fuckin' perp walked him
across campus,

19:30.236 --> 19:32.205
<i>and we're just supposed
to go on like shit is normal?</i>

19:32.238 --> 19:34.574
<i>What happened was a tragedy.</i>

19:34.607 --> 19:36.776
Two beautiful minds have gone to waste.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.312
Professor Reynolds will be missed,

19:39.345 --> 19:43.349
and Tariq will go to prison
for the rest of his life.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.786
Now, I think we should move on
and discuss the reading.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.422
You know, hearing of this...

19:50.823 --> 19:52.358
...broke my spirit.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.594
<i>Not only did I lose
a fellow brother in blue,</i>

19:54.627 --> 19:57.497
but it's potentially
at the hands of my own student.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.701
If Tariq is guilty,

20:01.734 --> 20:03.570
he let us all down.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.239
Do you think he could
have a chance at bail?

20:06.272 --> 20:09.809
<i>Like, could he come back on campus?</i>

20:09.842 --> 20:10.977
In class?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.812
Innocent until proven guilty.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.514
What country you livin' in?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.750
He's been charged with a double homicide.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.953
<i>One of the victims was a police officer.</i>

20:19.986 --> 20:21.754
He can't get bail.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.556
<i>It's not possible.</i>

20:23.590 --> 20:25.892
For the right price, anything's
possible, Professor Milgram.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.994
And may I remind you,

20:28.227 --> 20:30.763
the young brother
hasn't been convicted yet.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.999
Yet.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.406
What about us?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.442
We're supposed to stop because he's home?

20:42.475 --> 20:44.243
I think you should tell him
you're moving on,

20:44.277 --> 20:45.411
and so should he.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.547
Look, I don't know what to do.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.649
Just gimme some time
to figure this shit out.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.684
I got three kids by the man, Dante.

20:51.718 --> 20:55.021
And you have one by me
who deserves the truth.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.823
I want to meet my son.

20:56.856 --> 20:57.957
You could still meet Zeke.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.926
Our plans don't have to change there.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.966
I'll set it up, but we have
to move a certain way.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.035
And what kinda way
would that be...huh, Monet?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.803
I don't sneak around for anyone.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.872
I respect you too much to do that.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.777
Shit.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.882
Hold on, babe.
I'm getting on the elevator.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.384
Look, I'll hit you later with the details

21:24.417 --> 21:26.519
- for the Zeke meeting, okay?
- Cool.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.857
Can you hear me? <i>- I was trying to tell you,</i>

21:30.890 --> 21:32.792
your boy, Tariq,

21:32.825 --> 21:35.328
he got locked up for double homicide.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.530
They put Ramirez's body on him.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.999
<i>How did you and Cane swing that?</i>

21:40.033 --> 21:41.868
That wasn't very smart, Mo.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.004
How long do you think
it's gonna take the cops

21:45.038 --> 21:47.974
<i>to connect Tariq back to you? Hm?</i>

21:48.007 --> 21:49.375
Fuck!

21:53.012 --> 21:54.947
After seeing my nephew Zeke targeted,

21:54.981 --> 21:56.783
then they grabbed Tariq?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.618
Shit seems like a witch hunt to me.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.988
Do you think Tariq really did it?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.790
It's a witch hunt.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.091
What do they got on him?

22:07.493 --> 22:10.630
I'm not sure I should discuss
my client's case with you.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.633
However, that dead cop's badge

22:13.666 --> 22:16.536
was discovered in his dorm room.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.705
Any idea how that happened?

22:18.738 --> 22:20.473
No.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.547
Here's 250 bands.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.416
What exactly do you want from me?

22:30.450 --> 22:32.351
If anything happens in Tariq's case

22:32.385 --> 22:34.587
that leads to my family,
I want you to tell me.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.758
Double it and it's a deal.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.627
But I need you to understand
that the info I share with you

22:41.661 --> 22:43.029
will be limited to what you need to know

22:43.062 --> 22:44.731
when you need to know it.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.567
I won't share anything with you
if I think it'll hurt Tariq.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.703
Nigga, for 500,000,

22:50.737 --> 22:52.872
I don't give a fuck who it hurts,

22:52.905 --> 22:54.507
and you better not either.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.642
Call me.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.945
Why the fuck did you plant

22:58.978 --> 23:00.880
Ramirez's badge in Tariq's dorm?

23:00.913 --> 23:03.149
Ma, you said let the chips
fall where they fall.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.718
The badge fell in his room, okay?

23:05.752 --> 23:07.053
Fuck Tariq.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.788
Zeke's good now--I thought
that's what you wanted.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.592
One thing about you, Cane.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.128
You always know how to make shit worse.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.763
They got Tariq.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.164
He could rat on you.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.432
If he doesn't,

23:19.465 --> 23:21.134
whatever they got on him can lead to you.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.735
I made a deal with Davis MacLean

23:22.769 --> 23:25.138
to get us some inside information.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.907
I gave him 250 bands, but he wants double.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.908
Double?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.710
Fucking greedy bastard.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.679
<i>To make that,
we need CourseCorrect online.</i>

23:33.713 --> 23:35.782
But Tariq's behind bars, thanks to you.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.183
We can use the white boy Brayden.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.718
He can run the store.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.453
The same white boy you kidnapped.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.621
I mean, if it wasn't for him,

23:41.654 --> 23:43.422
we wouldn't have raised all that money

23:43.456 --> 23:45.091
we needed for Zeke's lawyer
when we needed it.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.126
Listen, Brayden
hit licks with me.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.195
He did what I said when I said it.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.997
I can play that little nigga like cards.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.765
You lost your mind.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.501
Ma, think about it.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.638
He's Tariq's day one since CourseCorrect.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.807
He knows this shit, he loves it.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.842
I'm telling you.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.677
Let me check him out for myself.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.979
Cool, I'll set it up.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.648
<i>And this stays between us.</i>

24:08.681 --> 24:10.449
- Mm-hmm.
- Papi and them cannot know

24:10.483 --> 24:12.218
we're keepin'
the Stansfield business going.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.986
<i>He'll either want it shut down, changed,</i>

24:14.020 --> 24:15.488
or run it himself.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.657
Mm-hmm, yeah.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.192
Or put Dru in position to run it.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.760
Exactly.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.829
We need to keep our independence.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.964
We gotta learn how to stick
and move together.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.868
- Right?
- Right.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.207
How'd your father get out?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.675
<i>Technicality.</i>

24:35.708 --> 24:38.511
Prosecution team was dirty.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.584
I know you like to be invisible and shit,

24:44.617 --> 24:45.952
but Pops, he wanna link.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.521
He wanna talk business.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.256
Now I see why you're stressing out.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.225
You think that, uh,
me dealing with your pops

24:52.258 --> 24:53.693
is gonna end our business together.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.528
He was inside. I found you.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.030
Dru ain't done shit.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.799
Now he wants to cut me out the middle?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.167
He does that, he no longer needs me.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.202
Now, why the fuck would
I play myself like that?

25:03.236 --> 25:06.138
Look who's finally learnin' from me.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.940
I like how you're thinking.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.811
Look,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.846
my relationship is with you,

25:13.880 --> 25:15.615
not your father.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.284
Far as I'm concerned,

25:18.517 --> 25:21.087
we never have to meet.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.067
You know, the funny thing is

25:35.101 --> 25:37.770
I knew your goofy ass'd
end up here one day.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.272
I really wouldn't be surprised

25:39.305 --> 25:40.907
if your crooked ass end up in here too.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.042
I still haven't received
any dirt on Sweeney yet.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.944
So what the hell
we need to talk about, huh?

25:44.977 --> 25:48.147
Listen, you can sit there

25:48.180 --> 25:49.882
and watch me rot in this motherfucker

25:49.916 --> 25:50.983
and not get your Sweeney dirt

25:51.017 --> 25:52.318
or you can help me get bail.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.986
When I get out, my priority will be

25:54.020 --> 25:55.154
getting you what you need.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.123
Nigga, I've been waiting
for that the whole time.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.592
What the fuck you think
I'm doin' at that school, huh?

25:59.625 --> 26:00.960
- You never delivered.
- Listen.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.695
I went on a family trip with the Westons.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.297
Sweeney was there.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.700
He brought up his old
college frat glory bullshit.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.636
Saw his secret photo album,

26:10.670 --> 26:12.772
a whole lotta weird, inappropriate shit

26:12.805 --> 26:14.206
that'd get an elected official

26:14.240 --> 26:16.776
in the headlines
for all the wrong reasons.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.110
I know exactly where it is.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.612
So you help me get up outta here,

26:19.645 --> 26:22.114
and I help you get your hands on that.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.154
Simple.

26:37.663 --> 26:40.032
A'ight. I'll set something up.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.168
But listen here,
if you get out and underserve

26:42.201 --> 26:43.836
after making this huge ass promise,

26:43.869 --> 26:47.640
I promise I will make your life
a living fuckin' hell,

26:47.673 --> 26:48.841
you cop killer.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.312
<i>We're not working
with Tariq anymore.</i>

26:53.346 --> 26:55.247
He got locked up for double homicide.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.352
And we're not trapping
at Stansfield either.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.989
<i>We can make plenty of money
right here in Queens.</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:04.957
I'll begin recruiting some workers.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.059
Each one of you will get your own crew,

27:07.093 --> 27:09.729
except you, Diana.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.797
I got other plans for you.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.133
And once we find the steady groove,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.936
you can fall back forever, babe.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.240
Cane...

27:21.273 --> 27:22.708
you hear from the plug yet?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.377
I'll let you know when he's ready.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.412
I'm waiting.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.290
Look, now that you're home,
you will not just be

27:38.324 --> 27:40.159
ordering me around
like I'm one of the kids.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.727
When I went to prison, I never stopped

27:41.761 --> 27:42.828
being head of the household, Mo.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.296
When you were inside, we would discuss

27:44.330 --> 27:46.298
and strategize together first.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.068
Right, when I was inside.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.070
I'm home now.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.905
You don't have to worry about that.

27:52.938 --> 27:56.675
I'm the one that taught
you the game, remember?

27:56.709 --> 28:00.046
Enjoy your retirement.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.751
Go shopping.

28:05.785 --> 28:09.789
Hit the Ave, enjoy yourself,
get yourself something nice.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.296
Prosecution recommends

28:17.329 --> 28:21.133
no bail--that seems unfair
and harsh, Ms. Sullivan.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.702
A detective's badge was found
in the defendant's dorm,

28:23.736 --> 28:25.704
<i>which is a shared room.</i>

28:25.738 --> 28:28.007
There is no forensic evidence?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.910
None at all tying our client
to either murder, Your Honor.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.851
Another young Black man in my courtroom

28:38.884 --> 28:42.354
experiencing the vicious cycle
of this racist system.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.958
<i>But I am a BIPOC ally.</i>

28:45.991 --> 28:49.762
So the cycle can stop with me.

28:49.795 --> 28:50.996
Mr. St. Patrick,

28:51.030 --> 28:53.199
do you work as well as go to school?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.967
How is that relevant, Your Honor?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.503
<i>Ms. Sullivan,
I wasn't addressing you.</i>

28:57.736 --> 28:59.305
<i>Go ahead, young man.</i>

28:59.338 --> 29:02.441
Yes, Your Honor.
I tutor students at my school.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.310
Good.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.012
What I'm going to do
is release Mr. St. Patrick

29:07.046 --> 29:09.115
on a 10% bail bond.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.884
<i>You'll still be required
to wear an ankle monitor.</i>

29:11.917 --> 29:14.420
Bail is set at $1 million.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.898
It's amazing-- I couldn't even see

29:25.931 --> 29:27.366
your hand up his ass from there.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.936
I have never seen Judge Lucas
conduct himself that way.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.372
Judge Lucas and I go way back.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.840
I'll leave it at that.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.242
What do you get out of this?

29:36.275 --> 29:37.977
And save the "good brother" speech.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.145
Be real with us.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.980
I just wanted to see
the young brother Tariq

29:41.013 --> 29:42.915
get a fair fight. Is that so bad?

29:42.948 --> 29:45.251
I mean, we all deserve that.

29:45.284 --> 29:49.488
Okay, okay, so that's complete bullshit.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.157
Like, level with me, Tate,

29:51.190 --> 29:53.359
what does the kid have on you?

29:53.392 --> 29:54.493
Okay.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.295
Whatever it is, it doesn't concern us.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.030
- What does he have?
- No, no, no.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.537
Make sure you don't involve yourself

30:04.570 --> 30:06.238
in any criminal behavior.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.540
They give an ankle monitor in hopes

30:07.573 --> 30:10.176
of catching you breaking the law.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.279
Yeah, they'll know
where you are at all times

30:13.312 --> 30:14.580
with that GPS tether.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.116
You can come and go
to my office as you please.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.151
You can't leave Manhattan
without permission.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.955
You have to stay on campus
or at this off campus residence

30:22.988 --> 30:24.590
you filed in your paperwork.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.892
Whose apartment is that?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.260
It's a friend's brother's place.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.095
I rented it out to gain custody of Yas.

30:30.129 --> 30:33.866
Oh, why--

30:33.899 --> 30:35.501
why didn't you think of her

30:35.534 --> 30:37.903
before you killed a cop?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.271
Why did you do it? <i>- How many fucking times</i>

30:39.305 --> 30:40.839
I gotta tell you that I didn't do it?

30:40.873 --> 30:42.975
Saxe, enough!

30:44.843 --> 30:47.413
Tariq, you can go now.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.082
Right, so I'm--
I'm free until trial, right?

30:50.115 --> 30:52.351
Well, not quite free.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.086
Be careful.

30:54.119 --> 30:56.322
The NYPD will have a target on your head.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.326
Trust no one.

31:00.359 --> 31:05.364
I mean, the only person
I can trust is gone.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.000
Did you--did you ever
get in contact with my mom?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.101
I haven't.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.403
And apparently her location has changed.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.606
<i>So the Feds aren't releasing any info</i>

31:13.639 --> 31:15.874
until her new location is secure.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.243
Just let me know once
you reach her, all right?

31:17.276 --> 31:20.279
I just-- I really need to talk to her.

31:29.221 --> 31:33.092
What the fuck is wrong with you?

31:33.125 --> 31:34.927
Yeah, you!

31:34.960 --> 31:37.496
First of all, you never
ask a client if they did it.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.032
Let alone attempt to lead them
into a confession?

31:40.065 --> 31:42.034
Once you know the truth,

31:42.067 --> 31:43.335
you can never put the client on the stand

31:43.369 --> 31:45.070
to support an alternative theory.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.339
It's the truth
that ties our fucking hands.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.641
It doesn't free shit.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.143
Come on. Wake up, Davis.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.980
I will bet my law license and my right nut

31:55.014 --> 31:56.582
that someone else will die

31:56.615 --> 31:58.150
now that he's back on the streets.

31:58.183 --> 32:01.120
Have you forgotten?
This isn't his first homicide.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.923
We get paid to work for Tariq,

32:04.957 --> 32:07.593
not against him.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.098
What's the update on Tasha?

32:15.067 --> 32:17.936
I found her location. She's in New Mexico.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.639
Turns out she's been requesting
to speak with Tariq.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.241
I think that's a bad idea.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.443
Well, for once, I agree.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.513
She tells him to run,
we'll miss out on money.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.549
No, his talk with Tasha can wait.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.086
Saxe...

32:40.326 --> 32:43.696
I want your word

32:43.729 --> 32:47.633
that you will never again ask Tariq

32:47.666 --> 32:51.236
for a confession.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.639
Cooper,

32:53.672 --> 32:58.043
I need it now.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.618
You have my word.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.734
'Riq, how'd you get out?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.171
Dude, are you good?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.040
In case this shit is bugged.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.241
No, I already checked.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.442
Yo, B, keep it a buck with me.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.677
Did you help Cane set me up, bro?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.679
'Cause I know for a fact
he bodied Detective Ramirez

33:33.712 --> 33:36.115
and he had access to here
and that fuckin' badge.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.750
So tell me the truth.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.485
I didn't know anything I was doing

33:39.518 --> 33:41.220
could've possibly been related to you.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.155
The fuck were you doing?

33:43.188 --> 33:45.524
Cane came by here looking for you.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.393
He wanted to make money moves,

33:47.426 --> 33:50.462
and...at the time,
it seemed like a good idea.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.264
You needed money for your sister.

33:52.297 --> 33:54.133
So I went with him.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.534
I mean, the shit started off fun.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.337
We got in a car chase,
we got shot at, we hit a lick.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.239
And then shit got weird.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.208
Cane had me help him move a dead body.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.410
Are you fuckin' kidding me, B?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.044
Kay, I didn't know
if it was the cop Ramirez.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.513
I wasn't able to tell.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.814
But when he dropped me off,

34:09.047 --> 34:11.150
I mean, he definitely came up to the room.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.251
I was sick.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.819
He could've planted the badge then.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.154
I fucked up, 'Riq.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.488
Bro, I told you to call me

34:16.522 --> 34:18.490
if you see Cane. You were too fucking dumb

34:18.524 --> 34:20.058
to realize that he was finessing you,

34:20.092 --> 34:22.060
and now I'm the one
payin' for that shit, bro--

34:22.094 --> 34:23.629
- Two murders!
- Okay, I'm sorry,

34:23.662 --> 34:25.664
but you can't put all the blame on me.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.232
If I knew what was going on,

34:27.266 --> 34:28.467
I would've been able to protect you,

34:28.500 --> 34:30.169
but you never fucking tell me anything.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.271
I always told you what
you needed to know, always.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.506
I mean, what the fuck you even
do this shit for, B?

34:34.540 --> 34:35.841
People out here dying and going to jail

34:36.074 --> 34:37.576
because they literally
have no other option.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.244
You playing this shit like a game, bro.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.146
Go tell your dad to get you a fuckin' job

34:41.180 --> 34:42.548
and quit before you get someone hurt.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.183
You're really gonna stand there and act

34:44.216 --> 34:46.718
like your dad wasn't rich
and well connected too?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.521
I chose this life just like you, okay?

34:49.555 --> 34:51.390
<i>I'm tired of you putting
your fucking problems</i>

34:51.423 --> 34:53.125
<i>on everyone else.</i>

34:53.158 --> 34:54.760
I admitted that I fucked up, okay?

34:54.793 --> 34:56.195
My bad.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.130
<i>But you said Cane did some foul shit.</i>

34:58.163 --> 35:00.299
What the fuck did you do?

35:00.332 --> 35:01.700
Oh, don't worry about me.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.535
A'ight, and don't worry about
fucking CourseCorrect no more

35:03.569 --> 35:04.703
'cause you're not on that shit.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.338
I built that shit with you, Tariq.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.740
And you put it at risk
when you let me get set up.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.211
Get the fuck outta my face.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.245
Tariq!

35:13.879 --> 35:15.481
<i>Quit asking me about Ramirez.</i>

35:15.514 --> 35:18.584
Okay, well, at least keep it
a buck with me about Tariq.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.319
Was he in on the Ramirez kill or not?

35:20.352 --> 35:21.653
Shut the fuck up, Peter Pan,

35:21.687 --> 35:23.322
and focus on impressing Monet, okay?

35:23.355 --> 35:25.324
Make sure she knows
that we do not need Tariq

35:25.357 --> 35:27.593
to keep CourseCorrect running.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.428
Okay, Dad.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.866
You know why you here?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.400
You need someone at Stansfield.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.703
I can get anybody for that.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.204
What makes you special?

35:39.238 --> 35:42.508
Well, I built this system with Tariq.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.576
And even though he's out on bail,

35:44.610 --> 35:47.513
I figured I'd repurpose
my white privilege, feel me?

35:47.546 --> 35:49.314
I can ride with a dead body in the trunk

35:49.348 --> 35:51.383
with the music up

35:51.416 --> 35:53.285
and it won't matter 'cause
the cops ain't checking for me.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.887
That ain't enough.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.722
White privilege can
save your ass from the law,

35:56.755 --> 35:58.223
but it can't save you from the streets.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.592
Nah, I can handle myself in the streets.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.261
Cane's seen it. My whole life,

36:02.294 --> 36:04.396
my family always thought I was a fuck-up.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.797
They still do.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.499
But I love this shit.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.834
<i>I mean, I'm finally good at something that</i>

36:08.867 --> 36:11.336
my parents have nothing
to fucking do with.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.504
You gotta let me do this, Monet.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.506
You need to go the fuck home.
You not ready.

36:18.243 --> 36:19.478
One more thing.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.480
Did you help Cane raise that cop's body

36:21.513 --> 36:24.216
and did you plant that badge
in Tariq's dorm?

36:27.519 --> 36:29.888
I don't know why
Cane tricked me into it but...

36:29.922 --> 36:33.292
I guess we're all
in a worse situation now.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.466
I saw your face when he said
Tariq was out of jail.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.702
You don't have the power
over him you think you do.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.504
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.606
Nah, just leave him alone.

36:47.639 --> 36:51.443
Let's focus on making
this money to pay Davis now.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.946
All right, what's the plan?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.958
Hey. I didn't think
you would ever get out.

37:05.991 --> 37:09.628
Yeah, well, you would've known
had you came to the courthouse.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.630
Why ain't you show up?

37:11.663 --> 37:14.600
Um, I--I honestly didn't know what to do.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.335
Lauren, you know me.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.003
Now you really think
I killed that cop?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.272
I don't know what to think, Tariq.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.406
The whole school was talking.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.941
Okay, so then let the school talk.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.576
They don't know me, you do.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.311
Professor Milgram said the evidence

37:26.345 --> 37:28.013
they have against you
is enough to convict.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.648
Listen, Professor Milgram's
only running her mouth

37:29.681 --> 37:31.583
because she's fucking Zeke, okay?

37:31.617 --> 37:32.985
He got accused for the same exact crime.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.252
So obviously she'll say whatever

37:34.286 --> 37:36.021
to make him look better, right?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.590
She's sleeping with Zeke?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.425
I had no idea.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.827
Look, let's just--

37:41.860 --> 37:44.496
let's go to your room and talk about this.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.569
Okay, I see how it is.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.505
Tariq, I really care about you.

37:53.538 --> 37:54.673
I'm just confused.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.609
What is there to be
confused about, Lauren?

37:57.643 --> 38:00.045
I'm on trial for my life right now.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.513
I might lose my sister forever,

38:01.546 --> 38:03.749
and I can't even speak to my mother.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.018
You're literally all I have.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.787
Either you with me or you against me.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.658
All right.

38:12.691 --> 38:13.725
Guess the people you love

38:13.759 --> 38:15.794
don't always love you back, right?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.829
Tariq, wait, can we just--

38:17.863 --> 38:19.564
can we really talk about this?

38:21.833 --> 38:23.335
Look, we're done talking, all right?

38:23.368 --> 38:25.337
And I'm done with you.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.674
Tariq, wait!

38:28.707 --> 38:30.442
Look, I'm gonna drop
your brother's key off

38:30.475 --> 38:32.477
after I grab my shit, okay?

38:39.017 --> 38:41.386
<i>You lied and said
Brayden was the target.</i>

38:41.420 --> 38:42.721
<i>Well, Brayden was the target</i>

38:42.754 --> 38:44.356
until the investigation pivoted.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.991
When did you learn
that Tariq was a suspect

38:46.024 --> 38:47.059
in the investigation?

38:47.092 --> 38:48.960
I didn't know he was an option

38:48.994 --> 38:51.363
until I helped you off those drug charges.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.398
Let's be clear. You never helped me.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.734
You forced me to wear that wire.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.970
No one put a gun to your head.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.839
You didn't want Mommy
and Daddy to find out

39:00.872 --> 39:03.608
that you got caught
with drugs in your room.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.444
You made your choices.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.612
And you didn't warn me about that why?

39:07.646 --> 39:10.982
Oh, 'cause you were too busy fucking Zeke?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.350
Zeke.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.685
You're fucking him.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.587
Don't play with me, okay?

39:15.620 --> 39:16.822
You got over once.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.757
Trust me, there's not
gonna be a second time.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.759
Zeke and I are none of your business.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.828
Well, y'all about to be
everyone's business,

39:22.861 --> 39:25.030
Professor Milgram.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.065
Let's have a conversation

39:27.099 --> 39:30.368
when you're able to control
your emotions, Lauren.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.871
I'm under control.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.651
What you doing here?

39:46.685 --> 39:49.454
I just wanna come show you
some love during these times.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.990
- Appreciate you.
- Yeah.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.993
And if you need any money
or anything, I got you.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.829
Well, right now,

39:57.863 --> 39:59.931
I gotta pay my lawyer $2 million,

39:59.965 --> 40:02.400
I lost the rights to visit my sister,

40:02.434 --> 40:05.470
'cause of all this bullshit
that's going on.

40:05.504 --> 40:06.671
I mean, I don't really need your cash

40:06.705 --> 40:07.939
but a new connect

40:07.973 --> 40:09.574
could definitely help. You got one?

40:09.608 --> 40:11.843
Uh, I'm sorry, is your room bugged?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.578
I mean, you think I would be asking you

40:13.612 --> 40:15.747
questions like this
if I ain't check already?

40:17.082 --> 40:18.717
Your connect got better shit
than my old guy

40:18.750 --> 40:20.919
and he stopped answering
his phone a while back.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.088
So I don't know.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.757
What happened to yours?

40:25.791 --> 40:28.059
Fucking Monet and her son Cane.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.061
They're trying to frame me
for this cop kill.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.830
And I know for a fact this nigga Cane

40:31.863 --> 40:33.965
pulled that trigger.
But when they put this--

40:33.999 --> 40:36.101
this plan in action to get rid of me,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.602
they even fooled Brayden's stupid ass

40:37.636 --> 40:39.437
into planting the badge in here
after I told him

40:39.471 --> 40:40.739
to stay the fuck away from Cane.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.874
Did he know why he needed
to stay away from Cane?

40:42.908 --> 40:43.909
Doesn't matter.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.710
A'ight I'm not fucking
with none of them.

40:45.744 --> 40:48.013
Brayden, Monet, they need me.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.681
I made this CourseCorrect shit pop.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.550
So without me, that shit is dead.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.518
They're gonna starve.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.620
What about the professor?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.088
Was that you?

41:01.493 --> 41:03.762
You don't gotta tell me.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.797
It's understood. Don't gotta be said.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.633
I mean, it was him or me, Effie.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.103
- I had no choice.
- You did what you had to do.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.542
And I pray that Yasmine
feels the same way.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.179
Damn, she probably hates me right now.

41:21.213 --> 41:23.148
And she may think you're monster right now

41:23.181 --> 41:25.584
but when she's older, she'll understand.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.485
But you gotta focus on getting this money

41:27.519 --> 41:29.020
so you can get her back.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.789
I mean, I won't be able
to make as much now

41:30.822 --> 41:32.123
that I don't got a team.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.859
You gotta keep Brayden on your side.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.760
I mean, he wasn't intentionally disloyal,

41:35.794 --> 41:38.530
but, like, he was stupidly disloyal.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.633
You know, I feel like
that's ten times worse.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.536
Without Monet, you can't make two mil.

41:44.569 --> 41:47.939
And she needs you to move her product.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.107
Be real with yourself, 'Riq.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.942
Why are you and Brayden really beefing?

41:50.976 --> 41:53.078
Were you honest with him about Cane?

41:53.111 --> 41:54.613
Look, I--

41:54.646 --> 41:56.915
I don't wanna talk
about that shit right now.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.850
I'm glad that you here.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.720
You know, you really
the only one that held it down.

42:14.966 --> 42:17.102
Wait, remember when Cane
wanted to be a rapper?

42:17.135 --> 42:18.970
Ooh, how can we forget?

42:19.004 --> 42:21.206
Making beats at the kitchen table.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.975
<i>Freestyling, driving Mami crazy.</i>

42:24.009 --> 42:27.979
You always found a way to get
under your mother's skin, man.

42:28.013 --> 42:29.681
Some things never change.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.116
<i>I still remember after dinner,</i>

42:31.149 --> 42:33.051
you would hit a beat on the table

42:33.084 --> 42:35.987
when we were supposed to be cleaning

42:36.021 --> 42:37.555
and me and Di would get up and dance.

42:37.589 --> 42:40.659
And Ma would come up in there
ready to whoop our ass.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.093
<i>Ma, on a good day, you'd join us,</i>

42:42.127 --> 42:45.130
on a bad day,
you'd run us out the kitchen.

42:46.865 --> 42:47.866
Mm.

42:47.899 --> 42:48.934
Ooh.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.702
<i>Uh-oh. Ah, here we go.</i>

42:50.735 --> 42:53.071
Hold up, hold up.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.173
Let me get--hold up, hold up,
hold up, right here.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.243
What?

43:03.214 --> 43:06.117
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

43:06.151 --> 43:09.087
Oh! Hey, hey, hey.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.256
Oh!

43:14.793 --> 43:16.628
I'm trying to do this, though.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.630
Is that right?

43:26.237 --> 43:28.106
I'm gonna go get some cheesecake.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.208
<i>That's perfect.</i>

43:30.241 --> 43:32.310
Hurry back though.

43:32.344 --> 43:33.878
I will.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.313
Love you.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.718
- <i>Cheesecake.</i>
- <i>Yes, yes.</i>

43:39.751 --> 43:42.754
Let's do it.

43:44.356 --> 43:46.358
We can't continue to do this.

43:46.391 --> 43:48.193
You said we didn't have to stop.

43:48.226 --> 43:51.029
Look, he's my husband
and the father of my kids.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.298
I sacrificed too much
to keep my family together.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.834
I can't give up on them now.
I owe them that.

43:55.867 --> 43:58.003
You don't owe Lorenzo anything.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.338
He had his chance,
and that jailbird blew it.

44:00.372 --> 44:02.407
Now, I have a son with you too.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.743
Nae-Nae, give our family a chance.

44:04.776 --> 44:07.746
Don't you owe that to Zeke?

44:07.779 --> 44:10.215
Look, I think it would be
best for everyone

44:10.248 --> 44:12.417
if this is the last time
we see each other.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.652
Okay.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.888
What about my son?
I still need to meet him.

44:16.921 --> 44:19.090
Can't allow that to happen.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.993
It'd be too disruptive to his ball career.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.862
His fucking ball career.

44:23.895 --> 44:27.399
What about his fucking life, hm?

44:27.432 --> 44:30.135
If you don't tell him,
I promise you, I will.

44:30.168 --> 44:32.037
You stay away from Zeke

44:32.070 --> 44:34.806
and you stay away from me.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.175
It's over.

44:47.819 --> 44:49.287
What's up, <i>mamita?</i>

44:49.320 --> 44:51.089
Everything all right?

44:51.122 --> 44:52.190
Yeah.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.758
I mean, seeing everybody smile

44:53.792 --> 44:54.993
confirms I did the right thing.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.294
Mm-hmm.

44:56.327 --> 44:58.063
But I don't know.

44:58.096 --> 44:59.931
How come Ma seems like
she don't feel that way?

44:59.964 --> 45:01.399
Nah, you buggin'.

45:01.433 --> 45:03.435
That's not true.

45:04.869 --> 45:08.773
So Mami and I decided to pay your tuition

45:08.807 --> 45:11.142
for St. John's University.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.317
What? I- I thought
you'd be happy about that.

45:19.350 --> 45:22.787
I mean, I'm happy you finally
let me go to school

45:22.821 --> 45:25.390
but St. John's, Papi?

45:25.423 --> 45:26.458
That's in Queens.

45:26.491 --> 45:28.059
I wanted to go to Stansfield with Zeke.

45:28.093 --> 45:30.128
Mami thought that was
the best choice for you.

45:30.161 --> 45:31.729
It's a good school.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.768
Nah.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.204
Monet knows exactly what she's doing.

45:39.237 --> 45:41.906
She's mad because she gave up
on you, but I never did.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.341
She never gave up.

45:43.374 --> 45:46.144
She's just burnt-out on these
last ten years, that's all.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.879
Well, if she never gave up,

45:47.912 --> 45:50.515
why does she have a exit plan
that doesn't include you?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.917
What plan?

45:59.224 --> 46:01.359
After I got shot,

46:01.392 --> 46:04.195
Ma felt we needed a safer hustle.

46:04.229 --> 46:07.799
So the plan was

46:07.832 --> 46:09.968
once Zeke was drafted,

46:10.001 --> 46:11.769
we would follow him out of town

46:11.803 --> 46:14.239
to wherever he got drafted to and...

46:14.272 --> 46:15.874
quit the drug game to work for him.

46:15.907 --> 46:18.343
Can we talk about this later?
I just gotta go out.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.917
I've been feeding myself
since I was 13 years old.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.919
You think I'm gonna take orders
from your fucking cousin?

46:27.952 --> 46:28.853
Yeah, that's the thing.

46:28.887 --> 46:32.190
Nobody knew you were gonna come home.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.159
You weren't part of the plan.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.960
Monet wanted a fresh start.

46:35.994 --> 46:37.028
I'm the fresh start.

46:37.061 --> 46:39.063
Your mom doesn't fucking get it yet.

46:39.097 --> 46:41.166
Once this family starts
moving on one accord,

46:41.199 --> 46:43.301
everything is gonna be perfect.

46:43.334 --> 46:44.536
Okay, but all I know is

46:44.569 --> 46:46.204
if you want this family
to move on one accord,

46:46.237 --> 46:48.907
then you and Ma need to get on one page.

46:48.940 --> 46:50.942
You're absolutely right.

46:55.580 --> 46:58.983
And I'm taking your advice.

46:59.017 --> 47:01.085
We're making a move on Kino.

47:01.119 --> 47:04.088
And I need you to tail him tonight.

47:08.126 --> 47:09.127
All right.

47:11.129 --> 47:13.131
Let me know how that goes.

47:29.347 --> 47:32.250
And I also wanna apologize
for questioning your loyalty.

47:32.283 --> 47:34.185
I know you're with the shit.

47:34.219 --> 47:36.087
Hold up, 'Riq.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.022
I got something to tell ya.

47:38.056 --> 47:40.425
I went on a meeting earlier
with Monet and Cane.

47:40.458 --> 47:41.893
He pitched me as your replacement,

47:41.926 --> 47:44.095
but Monet shut that shit down.

47:44.128 --> 47:46.364
Hm, so they are working together.

47:46.397 --> 47:48.866
Yeah. It was just them two though.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.469
I mean, I didn't see Dru or Diana.

47:51.502 --> 47:52.904
After spending time with them,

47:52.937 --> 47:54.339
I mean, I still don't have my head

47:54.372 --> 47:55.974
wrapped around this whole murder case,

47:56.007 --> 47:58.276
but Ramirez I'm pretty clear
you had nothing to do with.

47:58.309 --> 48:01.145
A'ight, remember
the kid that died in the pool?

48:01.179 --> 48:02.347
Yeah.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.182
Cane sent that kid up here to kill me.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.317
Someone named 2-Bit
that used to run with my uncle

48:06.351 --> 48:08.453
killed the GTG kid.

48:08.486 --> 48:10.955
I thought you said Cane did that.

48:10.989 --> 48:12.257
I lied.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.325
A'ight, but it was only
to protect you.

48:14.359 --> 48:15.960
I was being extorted by 2-Bit at the time.

48:15.994 --> 48:18.363
He would've came
and violated your ass too.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.999
But he hasn't hit my phone
in a minute so...

48:21.032 --> 48:22.267
we should be clear.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.401
Cane is the op, a'ight?

48:23.434 --> 48:26.037
He's the reason for all of this shit.

48:26.070 --> 48:29.307
What about Professor Reynolds?

48:29.340 --> 48:31.943
Professor Reynolds wasn't supposed to die.

48:31.976 --> 48:33.411
He just started doing too much.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.913
Once the kid died in the pool,
he wanted to help the cops

48:35.947 --> 48:37.615
with the investigation.

48:37.649 --> 48:40.318
And he wanted
to write a book about my life.

48:40.351 --> 48:43.321
I mean, he--he offered to pay,
so I met up with him.

48:43.354 --> 48:46.324
Cane followed me, and he overheard him ask

48:46.357 --> 48:47.525
if Dru killed the GTG kid.

48:47.558 --> 48:49.527
So he came out of nowhere
and blasted Reynolds.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.595
Then put the gun on me.

48:50.628 --> 48:53.398
Same exact gun he used to kill Ramirez.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.999
I told him I'd finish Reynolds

48:55.033 --> 48:57.535
and help him with everything
if he didn't kill me.

48:57.568 --> 49:00.004
He put the gun in my hand.

49:00.038 --> 49:03.007
So yeah, you know everything now.

49:03.041 --> 49:07.111
It's your choice whatever
you wanna do with that.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.615
You know I always got you, bro,

49:10.648 --> 49:12.650
no matter what.

49:12.684 --> 49:15.553
Yeah, but this shit ain't over, bro.

49:15.586 --> 49:17.088
We gotta protect ourselves.

49:17.121 --> 49:18.389
I need you to get closer to Cane

49:18.423 --> 49:20.325
so that nigga don't
catch us off guard again.

49:20.358 --> 49:23.027
I can do that.

49:23.061 --> 49:26.731
Also, um, you think
you could get your hands

49:26.964 --> 49:29.500
on your father's photo album from college?

49:29.534 --> 49:31.736
Something in there might be
able to help me with my case.

49:35.373 --> 49:37.175
Y'all are all I got.

49:37.208 --> 49:38.976
So with that being said,

49:39.010 --> 49:41.179
Effie will be handling
transportation and reups.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.314
Yeah, Monet probably had enough of me.

49:43.348 --> 49:45.583
Effie's the perfect solution.

49:45.616 --> 49:47.585
I usually am.

49:47.618 --> 49:49.253
Right.

49:49.287 --> 49:50.621
And you, I just need you
to cover meetings with Bash,

49:50.655 --> 49:52.657
and, y'know, handle the tutors
and CourseCorrect.

49:52.690 --> 49:54.625
We need to shut down
the Stansfield operation

49:54.659 --> 49:56.094
till this whole little murder frenzy

49:56.127 --> 49:57.362
y'all got going on dies down.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.696
Facts.

49:58.730 --> 49:59.697
That is true.

49:59.731 --> 50:00.998
Bet.

50:01.032 --> 50:03.034
All right, I'm out.

50:03.067 --> 50:04.235
- Be safe, bro.
- Yeah.

50:04.268 --> 50:06.037
Later, Bonnie and Clyde.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.782
What's up with you, man?

50:18.015 --> 50:19.650
Why'd you go so hard
for me not to bring Dru?

50:21.285 --> 50:23.321
And where the fuck is the connect?

50:23.354 --> 50:25.156
I am the connect.

50:26.591 --> 50:29.227
Stop fucking around, Cane.
Where's the connect?

50:29.260 --> 50:30.461
You didn't hear me?

50:30.495 --> 50:32.430
As far as you're concerned,

50:32.463 --> 50:34.665
I am the connect.

50:37.368 --> 50:40.538
Because when shit goes bad
with this connect, and it will,

50:40.571 --> 50:42.340
bring that same fucking energy.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.608
Didn't have to be this way.

50:43.641 --> 50:46.411
You chose Dru over me
and you lied to me, okay?

50:46.444 --> 50:48.246
You said I needed to learn the business

50:48.279 --> 50:49.614
so I can take over.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.349
You're not fucking ready.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.117
You're not ready.

50:53.151 --> 50:55.286
What, you back home
and you don't have shit.

50:55.319 --> 50:57.522
You're living off my mother.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.557
So what-- who we talkin' about, man?

51:05.062 --> 51:06.831
You're my son and I still love you.

51:07.064 --> 51:09.834
But this proves right here
why Dru is the right choice.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.769
You never think things through.

51:11.803 --> 51:14.505
And you can't play your own role, Cane.

51:14.539 --> 51:17.408
I see you kept the family going
and I respect that.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.177
I know you have a purpose, Cane.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.813
Okay, so it should be me by your side.

51:21.846 --> 51:23.448
Not Dru, okay?

51:23.481 --> 51:25.349
You and I both know
he's not built for this shit.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.151
You wanna be at my side, then why you keep

51:27.185 --> 51:29.253
blocking this connect from me, man?

51:29.287 --> 51:31.856
What the fuck do I look like to you, man?

51:32.089 --> 51:33.458
Make up your mind, Cane.

51:33.491 --> 51:35.526
Are you trying to be my boss

51:35.560 --> 51:37.829
or are you my son?

51:56.814 --> 51:59.183
Tariq's on the phone.

52:01.519 --> 52:02.687
<i>Who's your friend, Tariq?</i>

52:02.720 --> 52:04.188
<i>That's Effie.</i>

52:04.222 --> 52:05.723
We got some shit to straighten up

52:05.756 --> 52:07.124
before we move forward.

52:07.158 --> 52:09.260
How am I supposed to trust you?

52:09.293 --> 52:11.496
Got me locked up when I
told you the truth about Cane.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.397
Tariq, I know how this looks.

52:13.431 --> 52:15.566
But I need you to know
I had no part in this.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.735
<i>You and me both know who it is.</i>

52:17.768 --> 52:20.238
<i>He's fucked up, but he's still my kid.</i>

52:20.271 --> 52:21.839
You snitch, I shoot.

52:21.873 --> 52:23.474
You shoot, I slaughter.

52:23.508 --> 52:26.277
Yeah, I won't say shit about Cane but...

52:26.310 --> 52:27.879
you just make sure you keep him in check.

52:27.912 --> 52:30.314
I'll keep an eye on him. You have my word.

52:30.348 --> 52:32.383
<i>So we have a new way to do business?</i>

52:32.416 --> 52:34.352
Right now, they got me
on this fucking LoJack,

52:34.385 --> 52:35.720
I can't even leave Manhattan.

52:35.753 --> 52:37.622
But anything you need to get from me,

52:37.655 --> 52:39.257
<i>you can get it from Effie.</i>

52:39.290 --> 52:40.424
<i>You sure she'll
be able to keep up with me?</i>

52:40.458 --> 52:43.160
Yeah. Yeah, of course,
she can handle herself.

52:46.197 --> 52:48.733
- You know who I am?
- Yeah, I heard a lot about you.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.401
So Tariq pillow talks.

52:50.434 --> 52:51.669
Anybody I conduct business with

52:51.702 --> 52:53.538
I make it my priority to know about 'em.

52:53.571 --> 52:56.541
Tariq must really think he can trust you.

52:56.574 --> 52:59.443
You must be laying it on him.

52:59.477 --> 53:00.945
That ain't gonna earn you shit over here.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.513
Look, we can make real money together

53:02.547 --> 53:05.683
or we can make less money apart.

53:05.716 --> 53:08.286
Keep that burner. My number's in it.

53:08.319 --> 53:10.721
Just hit me when you wanna work.

53:10.755 --> 53:13.724
Watch your phone.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.230
<i>No, you don't understand,</i>

53:19.263 --> 53:21.699
<i>I never agreed to testify.
I can't take the stand.</i>

53:21.732 --> 53:23.534
<i>Sweetie, you signed the paperwork.</i>

53:23.568 --> 53:24.936
<i>It's a part of your deal.</i>

53:24.969 --> 53:27.605
But that bitch Carrie Milgram
tricked me into this, okay?

53:27.638 --> 53:30.541
I--I swear I had no idea I was involved.

53:30.575 --> 53:33.210
Life lesson--

53:33.244 --> 53:36.213
never sign anything without reading it.

53:38.482 --> 53:40.484
Good night.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.703
What are you doing here?

53:58.736 --> 54:01.672
Um, came to see you.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.874
Let's-- let's meet another night.

54:03.908 --> 54:06.978
I just have a ton of work to tackle.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.413

54:09.447 --> 54:13.250

55:37.668 --> 55:38.869
Ay, you don't got nothing to worry about.

55:38.903 --> 55:41.972
- You'll be fine.
- I can handle myself.

55:42.006 --> 55:45.342

he's around, you won't be safe.

55:47.878 --> 55:50.915

55:50.948 --> 55:53.551

55:53.584 --> 55:55.786
I don't wanna take that route.

56:17.975 --> 56:20.644
Maybe he didn't know you at all.

56:20.678 --> 56:24.148
