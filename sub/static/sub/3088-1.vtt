- Give me another bump.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.439
- What?
- Just give me another bump!

01:46.440 --> 01:47.565
Are you fucking serious?

01:47.566 --> 01:50.234
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.
Give me another bump!

01:50.235 --> 01:53.359

02:03.498 --> 02:05.792
- I'm out. I'm out.
- Fuck.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.048
I need some. I need some!

02:12.049 --> 02:14.258
I don't know what to tell
you, okay? Because I'm out.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.961
So, go and get some more!

02:16.261 --> 02:18.054
Fuck! What do you want me to do?
Make it out of thin air?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.847
I can't fucking do that, Candy!

02:19.848 --> 02:21.807
I'm tapped out! Do you
speak fucking English?

02:21.808 --> 02:24.102
Do you understand me? Tapped out!

02:24.436 --> 02:26.013
Fuck you! You...

02:26.396 --> 02:27.647
(SCREAMING)

02:27.648 --> 02:30.146
Jesus Christ! Okay, okay! Fuck!

02:30.567 --> 02:33.235
Hey! Calm down, okay? We're cool.

02:33.236 --> 02:37.111
For Christ's sake, just calm the
fuck down. Okay, I got it.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.408
Yeah, I know how to get some more.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.286
How?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.495
We order in.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.537
Yeah, okay. So you're
gonna get on this radio.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.255
You're going to get some hyped-up,
strung-out, horny trucker

02:53.256 --> 02:54.590
to come pay us a visit.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.716
He's going to come to the door.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.259
I'm going to knock him
in the fucking head.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.633
And, bam. We're in business.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.299
Okay? Here. Here.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.600
You know how the button works?

03:04.601 --> 03:07.020
Okay, just press that button.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.557
Hi, there.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.985
This is Candy and I'm
looking for some company.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.653
Any lonely truckers out there?

03:15.654 --> 03:17.606
Right. That's good.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.567
This is Rusty Nail.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.659
I knew a Candy Cane once.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.493
Where you at, baby?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.333
Come on. Tell him. Tell him.

03:30.085 --> 03:33.289
Candy Cane.
That's real cute, Rusty.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.044
You got any party favors on you?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.135
I don't party, little girl.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.014
Fuck. Fuck!

03:44.474 --> 03:48.769
You know what? It's okay.
Just get him to come meet us.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.979
And we'll roll him for his cash.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.647
- Okay?
- Okay.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.815
Come on, do it! He's going to...

03:52.816 --> 03:56.361
That's okay, big guy, we
can have fun other ways.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.028
Hey, get his phone number.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.949
What's your number, baby?

04:05.620 --> 04:09.370
555-0159.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.253
All right, now, just
like strike a pose.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.081
Like, smile. Look sexy. Okay.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.213
Yeah. That's nice.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.713
I sent you a text, sweetie.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.063
Mmm...

04:33.064 --> 04:35.187
Now that's real pretty.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.235
(CHUCKLING)

04:38.612 --> 04:42.782
Meet me at the Blue Jay
Motel off Route 17

04:42.783 --> 04:45.159
for an afternoon delight.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.577
(SNICKERING)

04:46.703 --> 04:49.577
Hurry, I can't wait to see you.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.000
Hey, tell him room 21.
Tell him room 21.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.919
Room 21, baby.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.379
I'll be there.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.631
Okay.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.585
I fucking love you, baby.
I love you. Fucking love you!

05:02.219 --> 05:04.217
So, he comes to the door.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.014
I hit him, and we get his wallet
and we just get out of here.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.725
Okay. Hey, we gotta get dressed.
We gotta get dressed.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.896
But I don't want to leave.
We already paid for the room.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.856
Candy, what the fuck do
you think is gonna happen

05:15.857 --> 05:18.067
if we hang around here
after we rob him?

05:18.068 --> 05:20.778
We're gonna go to fucking jail,
that's what's gonna happen. Okay?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.777
- Get dressed!
- Okay.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.245
Fucking flake out on me, Candy.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.948
Fine. I won't.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.634
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

05:48.932 --> 05:51.260
Okay, just stay there. Stay there.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.349
I'm gonna fucking smash him.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.321
(GROANING)

06:04.322 --> 06:06.024
How strange.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.819
You do not look anything
like your picture.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.871
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

06:20.630 --> 06:22.172
(BOTH GROANING)

06:22.173 --> 06:28.426
Hey, mister. Hey, please. Please.
We're sorry. Okay. Just let us go.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.013
We won't tell anyone. I swear.
I swear to you.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.343
Maybe.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.854
But then again, you two
haven't exactly shown me

06:36.855 --> 06:39.433
a track record of
honesty, now have you?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.192
(SOBBING)

06:42.444 --> 06:44.653
No! No!

06:44.654 --> 06:47.983
- Shut up. Please?
- Please. Please.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.497
Baby, are you okay?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.166
You have a choice to make.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.834
You got into this together.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.670
You can get yourselves
out of this together.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.546
These chains wrapped around
your wrists go under the truck,

07:05.675 --> 07:07.923
straight to the U-joint on my axle.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.720
All you gotta do is hang on
for 1 mile and not fall off.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.225
I'll set you free.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.145
But if one of you slips,
the chain will tighten.

07:17.604 --> 07:21.980
It'll wrap around the spinning axle
and pull you both under the truck.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.402
So you're gonna let
us go after 1 mile?

07:25.403 --> 07:26.650
I'm a man of m word.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.523
Here's a little reward.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.868
I'll let you keep this
bag of crystal I've got.

07:32.869 --> 07:37.449
Boy, there's enough there to get
you high for a good long time.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.542
But don't touch it until I stop.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.337
You gotta wait till
I give it to you.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.889
If you just take it, well,
that'd be rude. Okay?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.349
Time to go. Climb on up.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.937
(SOBBING)

07:59.938 --> 08:03.017
That's an order! I said, move!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.692
Okay. Okay.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.897
- Move! Come on! Let's go.
- Okay.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.944
There you go.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.278
Have a nice ride.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.277
Okay.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.125
(STARTS ENGINE)

08:30.760 --> 08:33.133
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.853

08:57.704 --> 08:58.996
Candy.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.540
(SCREAMING)

09:05.795 --> 09:07.212
Candy!

09:07.297 --> 09:09.631
Candy, look at me. Look at me,
right in my fucking eyes.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.506
Don't stop looking in my eyes,
okay? We can do this.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.387
We can fucking do this.
But you gotta help me.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.264
You gotta hold my
hand this whole time.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.012
All we gotta do is
hang on for 1 mile.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.803
Okay?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.233
Just hang on. Hang on.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.823
It's gonna be fine. Okay,
just like before. Okay?

09:34.824 --> 09:37.159
Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.862
(SCREAMS)

09:41.539 --> 09:43.582
No! Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

09:43.792 --> 09:46.370
Hey, hey! Grab my hand!

09:46.503 --> 09:48.705
Grab my fucking hand now!

09:49.506 --> 09:53.051
Okay, are you okay? I got you.
I got you. Are you okay?

09:53.510 --> 09:56.554
I got you. I'm just
gonna hold your hand.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.813
Hey, hey, that's gotta
be a mile, man!

10:05.814 --> 10:07.812
Come on, that's a fucking mile!

10:09.067 --> 10:11.736
That's gotta be a mile!
Stop the fucking truck!

10:13.863 --> 10:16.236
Good job. You made it.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.985
We made it.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.626
No. No, no. Keep looking at me.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.704
Keep looking at me. No, no, no!

10:30.255 --> 10:33.715
No, no. Candy! We'll get that later,
baby, just wait till it stops. No!

10:33.716 --> 10:35.589
Candy! No!

What's the range on these things?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.965
About 5 miles in flat terrain.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.842
Yeah? You think that's enough?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.719
It should serve the
purpose for the race.

This car is tight. It's gonna
blow the doors off everybody.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.590
Yeah. You used to say that
in high school shop class.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.925
Yeah. I had to carry
your ass back there.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.385
Otherwise, you would
have flunked out.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.720
And I'm still doing it today.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.430
I seem to remember it differently.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.803
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.768
Yeah, you tried to tank me with Amy
Crawford. You remember that?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.892
I don't recall.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.849
- Oh, you don't recall?
- No.

14:17.899 --> 14:21.103
- Amy Crawford, high school prom queen.
- Hmm.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.937
- You recall. Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.781
I was a junior taking her to prom.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.449
And you hated the fact
that I was her date.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.617
I did?

14:28.618 --> 14:29.785
And here I thought
you were my wingman.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.370
I am your wing man.

14:31.371 --> 14:35.917
But when it comes to women, wingman
or not, it's every man for himself.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.873
Yeah, fair enough.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.294
Hey. Did you guys get everything?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.462
Yeah.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.798
Where are the girls? Shouldn't they
be the ones doing the shopping?

14:42.799 --> 14:46.426
Oh, Jewel shops. Trust me. But
she's also a damn fine driver.

driving. So what good are they?

need to see if they're okay.

I'll pay whatever you want.

could make me whole.

You broke the rules, Jordon.

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.749
You killed a police officer.

out of control.

do the same to you and Jordon?
