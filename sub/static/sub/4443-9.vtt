00:00.510 --> 00:01.980
Previously on "The Fosters"...

00:02.050 --> 00:03.170
We can't give you money.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.495
Do you want to go with me?

00:05.530 --> 00:06.960
I can't. I have a thing.

00:06.995 --> 00:07.960
Ok.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.020
Yeah, but on one condition.

00:10.060 --> 00:12.315
- This is a date. OK? - OK.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.535
I don't need a piece of paper

00:14.570 --> 00:16.430
and a ceremony to prove our love and commitment.

00:16.465 --> 00:18.830
- But you would like it. - Sure.

00:18.865 --> 00:19.950
Really?

00:20.790 --> 00:22.315
Stop. Stop.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.180
He says I need to face my pain.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.320
I don't even think I've ever had the kind of pain
he's talking about.

00:30.550 --> 00:31.085
Yeah?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.250
What are you doing?

00:32.280 --> 00:33.900
Going to get our son.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.900
Anybody home? Police!

00:41.140 --> 00:42.300
Jesus!

00:45.970 --> 00:47.240
Drugs.

00:50.630 --> 00:51.745
Police!

01:35.410 --> 01:37.530
- Mike... Mike! - Don't talk!

01:37.565 --> 01:39.615
Two-Adam-20, 11-99! Officer down!

01:39.650 --> 01:42.000
- Six-six-three Coronado Street! - Twenty, repeat.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.090
Six-six-three Coronado Street!

01:44.460 --> 01:47.305
- Jesus! - I didn't think you were coming.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.980
I... I couldn't get away. Evan wouldn't let me go.

01:51.090 --> 01:54.330
I... I had to climb out of the bathroom window.

01:54.850 --> 01:57.250
You'll be safe here. They have a bed for you.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.480
OK, thank you.

02:00.190 --> 02:02.985
- Look, I gotta go. - No! Look, I hate to ask,

02:03.020 --> 02:06.780
but... I had to leave with nothing. Not even a toothbrush.

02:15.830 --> 02:16.890
Thank you.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.690
I'm sorry.

02:26.750 --> 02:27.920
OK, then.

02:39.710 --> 02:40.770
Why?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.850
I was arranging for you to meet with your birth mom.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.230
Why would you go behind our backs?

02:53.750 --> 02:56.560
- Where are you? - I'm with Lexi, at the movies.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.700
I know you're not with Lexi. Are you at Ana's house?

03:00.360 --> 03:03.420
Uh, no. I'm downtown.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.850
- At State and 3rd. - Stay right there. I'm on my way.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.670
- He's not at Ana's? - No. Let's go.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.560
Stef, Jesus called. He's not at Ana's.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.320
I'm going to pick him up right now. Call me, please.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.000
Hey, Mike, are you with Stef?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.420
Uh, listen, Lena...

03:49.540 --> 03:50.600
What's wrong?

04:40.890 --> 04:43.140
- Is anybody home? -Hey.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.110
- Where is everyone? - I don't know.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.930
House was empty when I got home.

04:47.130 --> 04:50.380
- So how was your silent movie? - Quiet.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.400
- Actually, Wyatt met me there. - Oh.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.540
How was your concert?

04:55.580 --> 04:58.220
Good. I, uh, actually went with Talya.

04:58.255 --> 05:02.240
Oh. Is that... are you guys?

05:02.600 --> 05:03.800
I don't know.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.730
Brandon? I'm Officer Juarez. You remember me?

05:14.765 --> 05:16.620
Yes, sir. You work with my dad.

05:16.870 --> 05:18.780
- He's been trying to reach you. - I...

05:19.040 --> 05:21.630
I turned my cell phone off during the concert. Um...

05:21.650 --> 05:23.830
What's going on? Is he all right?

05:29.700 --> 05:30.665
Officer Stephani Foster,

05:30.700 --> 05:33.440
gunshot wound to the chest, possible pneumothorax.

05:33.475 --> 05:34.650
What'd you give her in the field?

05:34.685 --> 05:35.235
A liter of fluids.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.640
Stef? I'm Dr. Johnson. We're gonna take care of you.

05:37.675 --> 05:38.720
Aspiration tray.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.680
Pulse ox is 80 and falling.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.525
BP 80 over 45. Pulse thready.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.840
Type and cross her for 2 units, stat.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.220
Pulse ox 75.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.070
I need you to listen for breath sounds.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.225
She's in v-tach.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.330
Let's not lose her. Come on, Stef!

05:53.160 --> 05:54.200
Where is she?

05:54.770 --> 05:57.070
She's here. They're... they're working on her.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.405
We sent officers to get Brandon.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.730
Is there anybody else we can notify?

05:59.765 --> 06:00.455
Stef's father?

06:00.490 --> 06:03.395
No. He's not in town. How did this happen?

06:03.430 --> 06:05.940
We went in the house, there was a guy, he had a gun.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.580
Where were you?

06:09.060 --> 06:10.240
Mr. Foster?

06:10.850 --> 06:12.315
Yeah. How is she?

06:12.350 --> 06:14.280
Your wife's condition is critical.

06:14.530 --> 06:18.020
- She's my ex-wife. - I'm her domestic partner.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.670
OK. We have our trauma team working on your partner.

06:21.705 --> 06:22.685
Can I see her?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.030
As soon as she's stable.

06:24.065 --> 06:25.310
She's not stable?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.285
Her lung collapsed,

06:26.320 --> 06:27.455
she lost a lot of blood.

06:27.490 --> 06:28.555
Is she gonna make it?

06:28.590 --> 06:30.490
We're doing everything that we can.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.290
As soon as she's stable, we'll bring you back.

06:34.770 --> 06:39.000
Was Ana there? Did she do this?

06:39.230 --> 06:42.250
No. She was with me.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.980
Don't be mad at him. This is my fault.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.400
Let's give your mom some space, OK? Come on.

06:54.435 --> 06:56.070
Let's go over here and sit down.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.830
Why didn't you call or text me back?

07:16.400 --> 07:17.850
I wasn't at Ana's house.

07:17.885 --> 07:19.300
Well, I didn't know that.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.000
This never would have happened - if you'd just told me where you were.

07:22.035 --> 07:23.005
Don't pin this on me.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.990
You brought Ana into our lives.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.050
She's stable.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.330
We need to get her up to imaging

07:38.365 --> 07:39.590
but you can see her briefly.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.330
- Can I come? - Mike.

07:41.530 --> 07:44.570
Only the significant other right now.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.290
It's OK. Go.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.925
You know you can't see Stef

07:57.960 --> 08:00.375
until Internal Affairs has gotten both your statements.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.790
Come on, there can't be any question. It was a clean shoot.

08:02.825 --> 08:04.637
But there are other issues at play here.

08:04.672 --> 08:06.506
Like what the hell you two were doing

08:06.541 --> 08:08.340
at that house in the first place.

08:26.950 --> 08:30.120
Hey. I'm here.

08:35.289 --> 08:36.590
The kids are OK. Jesus was...

08:40.549 --> 08:43.530
He's here with Mariana and Brandon.

08:45.780 --> 08:47.060
We're all here.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.830
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.430
Hi, I'm Lena Adams, the assistant vice principal.

08:56.465 --> 08:58.270
Hi, I'm Stef Foster.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.490
It's...

09:02.550 --> 09:07.170
- So, your son... Brandon. - Brandon... Brandon. Right.

09:07.205 --> 09:09.380
He will be starting kindergarten this fall?

09:09.415 --> 09:11.020
Yes. He's five:

09:11.260 --> 09:14.850
Great. Well, I would be glad to give you a tour,

09:14.885 --> 09:15.955
tell you about our school.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.435
Are we waiting for your husband to join?

09:17.470 --> 09:21.450
Uh, no. He's not... he... he couldn't make it.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.140
I'm sorry... OK.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.770
Well, um... follow me.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.470
Ok.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.645
So, she's... she's good.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.590
She's... she's opened her eyes.

09:40.650 --> 09:43.765
And she's going to be OK.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.170
They asked if we would move up to the second-floor waiting room.

09:46.205 --> 09:48.540
Excuse me. We need to get Mrs. Foster's insurance information.

09:48.575 --> 09:50.220
It's "Ms."

09:51.650 --> 09:53.080
Do I have to do that right now?

09:53.090 --> 09:54.420
I'm sorry.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.140
Why didn't Mom have her vest on?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.335
We didn't expect things to go down like this.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.430
Isn't that the point? To be prepared for anything?

10:05.370 --> 10:07.880
Mike. I.A. is here.

10:09.350 --> 10:10.300
I'll be back.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.960
- Brandon, don't. - What the hell is wrong with you?

10:18.220 --> 10:21.210
I thought you didn't want anything to do with your birth mother.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.440
That she was a drug addict and a con artist.

10:23.475 --> 10:24.657
I was just trying to help her.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.840
And look how that turned out.

10:25.940 --> 10:28.310
We took you in when no one else wanted you.

10:28.345 --> 10:30.095
When that woman abandoned you.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.050
- And this is what you do? - Brandon, stop.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.320
Because of you, my mom is in there fighting for her life!

10:35.355 --> 10:37.305
She's our mom too.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.920
And you, you started all this.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.700
- Back off. She feels bad enough. - She should feel bad.

10:42.735 --> 10:43.990
Brandon, walk away.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.280
He didn't mean all that. He's just scared.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.495
We were there on a personal matter.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.795
- Yet you were in uniform. - I didn't have time to change.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.385
But once you got there, you entered the house on police business?

11:00.420 --> 11:02.940
Yeah, when we saw drugs in evidence. But mostly we were worried

11:02.975 --> 11:04.690
that Stef's son might be in imminent danger.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.640
Even more reason to call for back-up.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.205
Unless you had another agenda, like...

11:08.240 --> 11:10.975
abusing your position as police officers to intimidate

11:11.010 --> 11:13.710
this birth mother who just wanted to see her kids.

11:13.745 --> 11:15.225
They're not her kids.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.435
They were adopted by Stef and her partner.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.130
- Your wife's a lesbian? - My ex-wife,

11:19.165 --> 11:20.755
and what the hell is wrong with you?

11:20.790 --> 11:23.115
We're just trying to understand the dynamics involved.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.315
You want to understand something? One of our own was gunned down!

11:26.350 --> 11:29.480
Are you guys done here? My officer's been through a lot tonight.

11:29.515 --> 11:31.950
Just one more thing. You said she was conscious.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.210
- After she was shot? - Yeah.

11:34.710 --> 11:38.250
She tried to talk, but I told her not to say anything.

11:38.770 --> 11:42.980
Until Officer Stef Foster is able to speak to us,

11:43.015 --> 11:43.925
he's not to see or talk to her.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.800
I will have two officers to stay with him at all times.

11:46.835 --> 11:48.360
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.220
- It was a clean shoot. - Then you got nothing to worry about.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.100
- Where is everybody? - They're coming up.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.870
So I knew Mariana was in touch with her birth mother.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.710
I just... I thought it was just a one-time thing.

12:15.390 --> 12:16.360
To give her money.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.270
So you knew Mariana was the one selling Jesus's pills at school?

12:25.320 --> 12:27.390
I should have come to you guys.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.870
I just... I wasn't thinking. I didn't think...

12:35.910 --> 12:37.930
This is what happens when people don't think.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.415
Where's Jude?

12:49.450 --> 12:52.180
He's at his friend Connor's, spending the night.

12:55.420 --> 12:58.690
- Does he know? - I don't think so.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.820
It's probably better if he doesn't.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.870
Hey, did they find Ana at the women's shelter?

13:10.880 --> 13:13.050
Uh, she wasn't there.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.830
The people said she came in, but she left pretty quick.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.555
Did you give any money?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.015
Just what I had on me. Like, 16 bucks.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.440
OK, well, she won't get far on that.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.030
- We really screwed up. - It's OK.

13:29.170 --> 13:32.140
Did you shoot him? Ana's boyfriend?

13:33.450 --> 13:34.390
Yeah.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.880
- Is he dead? - Yeah.

13:43.050 --> 13:43.910
Good.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.310
When someone gets killed,

13:48.320 --> 13:50.370
it's never good, no matter what they did.

13:51.020 --> 13:51.960
OK?

13:53.420 --> 13:54.430
Miss Adams?

13:54.480 --> 13:55.435
Hi, I'm Dr. Aldicott.

13:55.470 --> 13:57.490
I'm the attending surgeon on your partner's case.

13:57.525 --> 13:58.155
How is she?

13:58.190 --> 14:00.555
Well, the good news is, beyond the lung,

14:00.590 --> 14:02.670
there wasn't damage to any other vital organs

14:02.705 --> 14:04.320
Oh, thank God.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.695
OK. What's the bad news?

14:05.730 --> 14:07.470
The bullet's resting near the spine,

14:07.505 --> 14:09.175
which in itself isn't cause for concern.

14:09.210 --> 14:12.970
However, if any fragments migrate into the spinal canal,

14:12.980 --> 14:14.920
there's a risk of neurological damage,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.860
so she'd need surgery to remove them.

14:16.895 --> 14:18.597
Damage, like paralysis?

14:18.632 --> 14:20.265
It's a possibility.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.890
- Can we see her? - He's our son.

14:21.925 --> 14:23.365
Yeah, but briefly.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.900
And she's in ICU, so immediate family only. OK?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.030
I can take you now.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.565
You guys, Mom has a tube in her throat.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.060
It looks scary, but it's just there to help her breathe. OK?

14:36.870 --> 14:39.420
- Callie? - I'm... I'll wait here.

14:39.890 --> 14:40.720
OK.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.400
Honey, we're all here.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.360
Brandon, Mariana, Jesus.

15:06.330 --> 15:09.500
You're doing really great. And we love you.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.700
All right.

15:21.750 --> 15:22.820
Brandon.

15:23.430 --> 15:26.010
I want you to take everybody home so you can get some sleep.

15:26.045 --> 15:28.320
I want to stay. What about Dad?

15:28.430 --> 15:31.430
Your father's got enough on his plate. I need you to step up.

15:33.220 --> 15:36.460
And, uh, bring me some clothes when you come back in the morning?

15:38.770 --> 15:41.530
Mariana, Jesus, Brandon is in charge.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.020
Brandon took the twins home.

15:57.810 --> 15:59.820
I'm trying really hard...

16:01.670 --> 16:02.880
...to forgive them.

16:06.070 --> 16:08.150
I'm sorry I'm not doing a better job.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.670
- What're they in for? - Armed robbery.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.040
Seriously.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.050
Their foster parents dropped them off.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.080
Said they couldn't take care of them anymore.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.130
We're waiting for CPS to come get them.

16:54.340 --> 16:58.260
Hey, guys, my name's Stef. What's yours?

16:59.260 --> 17:02.950
I'm Jesus and this is my sister Mariana.

17:02.985 --> 17:06.640
Jesus and Mariana. You brother and sister?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.290
Or is this your wife?

17:11.220 --> 17:14.420
Well, I'm sure you guys probably don't like candy.

17:14.454 --> 17:16.450
But I just... I don't know. Just in case...

17:32.610 --> 17:33.720
What're you doing?

17:35.450 --> 17:37.120
Mom's been asking us to go through

17:37.130 --> 17:39.110
this stuff so she can make room in the closet.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.830
I remember this.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.015
My "Nite-Nite!"

17:45.050 --> 17:47.010
You dragged this thing everywhere with you.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.000
You would scream your head off if I even touched it.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.950
Moms gave us this at our adoption day.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.120
"We didn't give you the gift of life,

18:00.120 --> 18:01.720
but in our hearts we know

18:02.770 --> 18:05.000
the love we feel is deep and real,

18:05.780 --> 18:07.460
as if it had been so.

18:08.060 --> 18:09.630
For us to have each other,

18:10.360 --> 18:12.120
is like a dream come true.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.340
Though we didn't give you the gift of life,

18:16.450 --> 18:18.420
life gave us the gift of you."

18:27.150 --> 18:29.000
What if they don't want us anymore?

18:43.950 --> 18:46.520
- Hey. - You scared me.

18:46.555 --> 18:49.090
Sorry. I saw the light on.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.300
I don't know what clothes to bring Lena.

18:52.510 --> 18:53.520
Let me.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.100
Do you remember what you told me,

19:00.290 --> 19:03.210
how your moms asked you if Jesus and Mariana

19:03.245 --> 19:04.610
could come and live with your family,

19:05.860 --> 19:08.475
you said yes,

19:08.510 --> 19:10.630
because you figured there was enough to go around.

19:12.030 --> 19:13.020
Yeah.

19:16.330 --> 19:18.420
You don't know what's it's like to not have enough.

19:19.370 --> 19:20.965
To not be wanted.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.285
So that means I don't have a right to be angry?

19:22.320 --> 19:28.600
No. It means you don't know what it's like to wonder why.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.865
Why the people that brought you into this world,

19:32.900 --> 19:35.510
the people who were supposed to love you more than anyone else,

19:36.130 --> 19:37.380
didn't.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.970
So don't be a jackass.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.320
I'm sorry I'm an ass.

20:23.310 --> 20:25.970
I'm sorry you're an ass too.

20:30.970 --> 20:33.460
Look, you're my brother...

20:34.820 --> 20:39.800
and you're my sister, and our moms are our moms.

20:55.470 --> 20:58.280
- What are you doing? - It's the middle of the night.

21:00.310 --> 21:02.210
Ask who it is.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.720
- Who is it? - It's Jude.

21:11.060 --> 21:15.030
- What are you doing? - I couldn't sleep so I came home.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.650
- You walked here in the dark? - It's not that far,

21:17.685 --> 21:19.922
and I didn't want to wake Connor or his parents.

21:19.957 --> 21:22.160
What about when they wake up and find you gone?

21:22.195 --> 21:23.520
I left a note.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.255
They told me what happened to Stef.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.770
I just wanted to be with everyone.

21:29.810 --> 21:33.650
I'll call them. Don't ever do that again, OK?

21:34.140 --> 21:36.200
We should all try to get some sleep.

21:47.590 --> 21:50.460
Callie. Are you awake?

21:52.380 --> 21:54.030
I am now.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.170
This reminds me of our mom.

22:03.350 --> 22:07.390
I know. Me too.

22:07.400 --> 22:11.010
- Is Stef going to die? - No.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.420
This family is not like ours.

22:15.450 --> 22:17.460
They're lucky.

22:19.020 --> 22:20.390
Go to sleep.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.280
- Hey. You sleep? - Not really.

22:39.310 --> 22:42.950
- You? - Same.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.980
- What're you making? - Biscuits and gravy.

22:47.930 --> 22:51.060
- You've never had biscuits and gravy? - No.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.790
It's comfort food. My mom used to make it.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.820
So I know you said your mom died,

23:01.855 --> 23:04.065
but I don't think you ever

23:04.100 --> 23:06.220
said why you and Jude ended up in foster care.

23:07.540 --> 23:08.570
You don't have to tell me.

23:08.610 --> 23:11.830
I just realized I don't really know your story.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.880
It's not a long one.

23:16.450 --> 23:21.350
Um, my mom died in a car accident.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.730
And my dad was driving.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.080
He was drunk.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.880
And he ran a red light and hit another car.

23:29.915 --> 23:31.180
And...

23:32.090 --> 23:35.290
Some people in that car died, too.

23:35.325 --> 23:38.490
So he went to jail for manslaughter.

23:40.570 --> 23:43.075
And there was no family to take us in.

23:43.110 --> 23:45.580
So we went into the foster system.

23:46.970 --> 23:48.880
You know the rest.

23:50.270 --> 23:52.930
Is your dad still in prison?

23:52.965 --> 23:54.770
I guess, yeah.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.610
I used to write him letters, but he stopped answering them.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.190
Why?

24:04.720 --> 24:08.560
Do you think he'll come back for you and Jude?

24:08.595 --> 24:11.490
- If he gets out? - No, I doubt it.

24:12.190 --> 24:14.510
- I'm sorry. - Not your fault.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.020
It doesn't have to be my fault for me to feel bad.

24:36.580 --> 24:37.855
I brought donuts.

24:37.890 --> 24:40.830
Now, that's comfort food. Thanks, man.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.170
Hello?

24:49.980 --> 24:51.840
Oh. OK.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.040
Yeah. See you in a bit.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.080
They're taking my mom into surgery.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.980
So I should get everyone up.

25:09.020 --> 25:11.150
Did they say how long she'd be in surgery?

25:11.730 --> 25:13.690
Uh, they weren't sure.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.460
- Have you eaten anything? - I had some toast.

25:22.495 --> 25:23.770
What about you guys? Have you all eaten?

25:23.805 --> 25:25.670
Wyatt brought donuts.

25:29.320 --> 25:33.040
Um, do you want to get some air?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.680
Sure.

25:54.860 --> 25:55.625
The only thing you might

25:55.660 --> 25:58.035
take heat for is not calling for back-up.

25:58.070 --> 26:01.840
Worst case, a day or two suspension for both of you.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.840
OK. That's good news.

26:06.330 --> 26:09.620
There's...another issue, Mike.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.965
- It's your drinking. - Come on.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.960
I've never had a drink on the job.

26:13.995 --> 26:16.087
Yeah, but your after-hours drinking

26:16.122 --> 26:18.145
is affecting your work performance.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.510
I'm really hoping that this is a wakup call for you.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.000
So you saying it's my fault Stef got shot,

26:24.035 --> 26:26.120
because I had a few drinks the night before?

26:26.155 --> 26:27.630
I'm not saying that.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.865
But you did put a Band-Aid on the problem before.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.250
That was during the divorce. It was a bad time, Captain.

26:33.285 --> 26:37.360
Your partner got shot, and you just killed a man.

26:41.140 --> 26:43.490
OK, I'll take care of it.

26:44.010 --> 26:45.125
Thanks.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.955
Right now I need a cup of coffee.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.750
And I don't need two babysitters.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.835
- Thanks. - Are you ready to order?

26:57.870 --> 27:00.490
- I'm still waiting for someone. - OK, no problem.

27:10.230 --> 27:12.000
How are you? Sorry I'm late.

27:15.890 --> 27:18.110
Look, this separation has been good.

27:18.145 --> 27:21.277
I mean, bad...but good.

27:21.312 --> 27:24.375
It's made me realize that

27:24.410 --> 27:27.765
I have not been present in our marriage for a while.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.120
And I'm sorry. Our family is everything to me, Stef.

27:31.530 --> 27:34.140
I'm going to spend more time with you and Brandon,

27:34.175 --> 27:36.040
I'm gonna communicate.

27:36.870 --> 27:40.300
I'll even go to counseling. I just...

27:41.270 --> 27:42.500
I love you.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.770
Counseling can't fix what's wrong with us.

27:45.805 --> 27:47.530
I thought that's what you wanted.

27:47.950 --> 27:51.140
You're a good man and you're a really good dad.

27:51.530 --> 27:56.180
- But I haven't been happy. - Yeah. Lately. Me neither.

27:57.310 --> 27:59.495
But things were good before, Stef.

27:59.530 --> 28:01.680
Because I tried to make them good.

28:03.100 --> 28:07.925
But...but something was missing

28:07.960 --> 28:11.540
because I was not able to love you the way you loved me.

28:11.575 --> 28:14.240
I don't understand. Why not?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.530
Because I'm gay.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.790
I'm a lesbian.

28:21.320 --> 28:25.630
And I'm so sorry for you and for me for...

28:27.020 --> 28:30.470
...for it taking so long to be able to say that,

28:30.505 --> 28:34.930
and to accept...before now.

28:36.770 --> 28:38.160
Why now?

28:42.980 --> 28:45.000
Because I met someone.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.825
I hate hospitals.

29:17.860 --> 29:19.820
You're using me.

29:21.740 --> 29:24.820
- What? - It's OK. I'm not mad.

29:25.420 --> 29:28.440
Not exactly. I don't think you can help it.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.420
How you feel about Brandon.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.445
Don't deny it or I will get mad.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.610
Look, I get that it's forbidden for foster kids to hook up

29:38.645 --> 29:40.330
with other kids they live with,

29:41.370 --> 29:44.320
but it's not like they're keeping you. I mean, right?

29:45.740 --> 29:49.990
You're just here until they can find you guys a permanent home.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.000
I can't believe I'm saying this...

29:55.640 --> 29:59.820
If you're into Brandon, then go for it.

30:00.550 --> 30:03.890
- Be happy. - I can't. You don't understand.

30:05.050 --> 30:08.070
Maybe I don't. I don't know you that well,

30:08.460 --> 30:10.790
partly because you don't make it easy to.

30:11.290 --> 30:14.640
But one thing I'm pretty sure of

30:14.800 --> 30:17.130
is that putting your heart out there scares you a lot more

30:17.160 --> 30:19.030
than getting caught breaking the rules.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.305
If being here, in this situation,

30:23.340 --> 30:25.510
isn't proof enough that you've got to seize the day,

30:25.540 --> 30:27.070
then I don't what is.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.850
- Where's Wyatt? - He had to go.

31:18.190 --> 31:19.320
She did great.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.105
We removed all the bullet fragments.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.170
- But not the bullet? - Believe it or not,

31:24.200 --> 31:25.780
it can be more harmful to take them out.

31:26.070 --> 31:28.350
So, in about an hour, we're gonna move her back up

31:28.385 --> 31:30.160
to ICU where you can all see her.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.540
We feel optimistic she's going to make a full recovery.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.260
Thank you.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.350
I'm not doing this.

32:42.830 --> 32:45.360
I'm not getting involved with a married woman.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.230
Women like you, you are just passing through.

32:48.265 --> 32:49.915
But this is where I live, Stef.

32:49.950 --> 32:52.680
I told Mike. And I told my dad and I told all of my...

32:52.690 --> 32:55.320
well, most of my friends. I told them I'm gay.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.930
I even used the word "lesbian".

33:00.090 --> 33:02.300
I told them I met a woman I can't live without.

33:02.335 --> 33:04.560
And I belong with you, Lena.

33:11.770 --> 33:12.990
That is, if you'll...

33:13.260 --> 33:14.470
You had me at "lesbian."

33:25.210 --> 33:26.090
No, no, no.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.880
No. Don't talk. Don't talk.

33:35.990 --> 33:37.510
Will you marry me?

33:42.660 --> 33:44.310
I thought you'd never ask.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.760
Neither did I.

33:48.180 --> 33:50.410
Don't ever scare me like that again.

33:52.270 --> 33:54.380
Um, how are my babies?

33:57.340 --> 33:58.370
They're OK.

33:59.630 --> 34:00.810
They were scared.

34:01.150 --> 34:02.650
And Mariana?

34:27.870 --> 34:30.280
Remember, before this,

34:30.880 --> 34:34.239
when I asked you why you went behind our backs to meet with Ana?

34:36.380 --> 34:37.050
Yeah.

34:38.110 --> 34:41.370
Well, I've been thinking about that and I realized...

34:42.389 --> 34:44.520
I don't think you even know why.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.594
I think... what you were craving

34:48.630 --> 34:51.679
was more than just some supervised visit with your birth mom.

34:54.010 --> 34:55.284
You were wanting a relationship

34:55.320 --> 34:56.870
with the woman who gave birth to you,

34:56.905 --> 34:58.420
who you look like, who...

34:59.340 --> 35:01.570
who had it together now, and...

35:02.270 --> 35:04.160
and regretted not being able to keep you.

35:09.850 --> 35:14.210
I know it must be hard to understand how your birth mom

35:14.480 --> 35:17.010
could have chosen drugs over you and your brother.

35:20.210 --> 35:21.560
I don't understand it.

35:24.330 --> 35:28.960
All I know is... we chose you.

35:30.860 --> 35:32.160
And you chose us.

35:32.370 --> 35:34.650
DNA doesn't make a family.

35:36.270 --> 35:37.450
Love does.

35:44.150 --> 35:45.390
We love you.

35:47.050 --> 35:48.850
And that is never gonna change.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.325
Hey. There you are.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.150
- Hey. What's up? - I heard about Stef. That's great news.

36:07.180 --> 36:11.190
Yeah. So they picked up Ana downtown.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.390
They're gonna bring her back here to ID her boyfriend's body.

36:14.790 --> 36:16.410
She's saying she was there,

36:16.790 --> 36:18.660
at the house, at the time of the shooting.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.025
No, she was with Jesus.

36:20.060 --> 36:22.480
She says she climbed out a bathroom window.

36:22.710 --> 36:25.930
The women's shelter was close by. So if she ran straight there,

36:26.200 --> 36:27.020
it's possible.

36:27.210 --> 36:29.190
You're saying she met Jesus knowing her boyfriend

36:29.225 --> 36:31.392
- just shot his mother? - Point is,

36:31.427 --> 36:33.560
if she was there, she was a witness.

36:35.230 --> 36:38.570
If you have anything else you want to add to your statement, now would be the time.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.220
We were sweeping the house.

36:50.290 --> 36:54.460
I cleared the first bedroom, and then entered the second.

36:55.330 --> 36:57.250
It was dark. Um...

36:59.630 --> 37:02.840
And I heard movement from across the room...

37:05.460 --> 37:09.320
...and a gun shot, and... and I was hit.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.795
Officer Foster said you tried to speak,

37:14.830 --> 37:17.390
but he told you not to and called for back-up.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.010
I...

37:20.220 --> 37:22.500
The first thing I remember was being in the ambulance.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.820
OK. That's enough for now.

37:27.550 --> 37:28.610
Get some rest.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.125
- Hey. - I want to talk to you.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.330
- What's there to talk about? - Brandon, do you have any idea

37:43.365 --> 37:45.275
what I've been through in the last 24 hours?

37:45.310 --> 37:48.000
Do you have any idea what we've all been through?

37:49.090 --> 37:51.490
You were drinking while Mom was in surgery.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.480
You know who does that?

37:52.515 --> 37:53.560
An alcoholic.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.730
- Don't walk away from me. - Get away from me!

37:56.640 --> 37:57.610
Brandon!

37:59.030 --> 38:00.350
I am done with you!

38:01.350 --> 38:03.860
- What is going on? - Nothing.

38:08.010 --> 38:09.810
Come on. Everybody's tired.

38:27.450 --> 38:28.970
If you ever go near my kids again,

38:29.005 --> 38:30.490
it'll be the last thing you do.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.290
Let's go home.

39:00.260 --> 39:04.490
- How you feeling? - Never better.

39:09.000 --> 39:09.940
Look at the bright side,

39:09.950 --> 39:11.420
you'll never walk through a metal detector again

39:11.455 --> 39:13.322
without setting it off.

39:13.357 --> 39:15.190
Oh, great. Hand searches?

39:15.225 --> 39:16.580
My favorite.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.960
It wasn't your fault.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.770
I shouldn't have let us go in there.

39:23.850 --> 39:25.670
We should have waited. Called for back-up.

39:25.705 --> 39:27.362
You know I wasn't gonna wait.

39:27.397 --> 39:29.020
I thought Jesus was in there.

39:29.490 --> 39:34.110
I'm sorry. I wish it had been me.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.650
Me too.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.180
Ow... Ow, I can't laugh.

39:45.340 --> 39:48.930
- They, uh, they picked up Ana. - Oh, yeah?

39:49.090 --> 39:50.670
Yeah. She said she was there.

39:51.110 --> 39:54.860
At the house? Where?

39:55.100 --> 39:58.560
- The bathroom. - So she saw the shooting?

39:58.595 --> 40:00.600
Doesn't matter. It was a clean shoot.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.860
The guy had a gun, he shot a police officer.

40:02.895 --> 40:04.510
He got what he deserved.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.460
She's probably lying anyway.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.240
- Mike... Mike! - Don't talk!

41:49.760 --> 41:52.015
Two-Adam-20, 11-99! Officer down!

41:52.050 --> 41:54.880
- Six-six-three Coronado Street! - Twenty, repeat.

41:54.915 --> 41:57.050
Six-six-three Coronado Street!

41:58.305 --> 42:04.262
