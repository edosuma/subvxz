WEBVTT

01:44.647 --> 01:46.881
Let me the fuck in!

01:46.883 --> 01:48.883
Get... Get up!

01:48.885 --> 01:50.283
Let me in!

01:54.524 --> 01:56.357
Brother, are you seeing this?

01:56.359 --> 01:57.694
There's a riot
on every fucking floor.

02:01.397 --> 02:04.732
Look, you don't want
to feed them, fine.

02:04.734 --> 02:07.468
Don't need to no more,
'cause I did it.

02:07.470 --> 02:10.605
I found a buyer... 500K.

02:10.607 --> 02:12.172
This is the time, man.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.908
- Buyer won't wait.
- Oh, man.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.177
This high...

02:25.822 --> 02:28.623
Let's talk on the balcony.

02:40.903 --> 02:43.138
You've done fine work, Roadie.

02:44.474 --> 02:45.940
Is it real?

02:45.942 --> 02:48.442
Yeah, sure as shit.

02:48.444 --> 02:51.848
It all goes down tomorrow
at dawn, 18 hours.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.259
Great.

03:05.461 --> 03:07.162
Unload everything.

03:08.330 --> 03:10.498
I'm gonna blow this town.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.200
On it.

03:36.025 --> 03:38.193
Did you follow me down here?

03:42.330 --> 03:43.933
Is this what you want?

03:53.009 --> 03:54.577
So?

03:55.712 --> 03:59.747
Go on... if you really want it.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.710
I'm not saying I condone

05:02.712 --> 05:04.678
a militia mentality here
or anything like that,

05:04.680 --> 05:07.014
but I'm saying people need to
take this into their own hands.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.649
The cops can't do anything
anymore.

05:08.651 --> 05:09.784
There's not enough of them.

05:22.498 --> 05:23.898
They're taking care
of themselves.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.865
They're killing each other.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.700
We don't need to go in there
and do anything.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.035
I'm not gonna risk my life.

05:38.114 --> 05:40.881
I drive down the street,
yes, I see less homeless people.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.082
Maybe there's more crime
around there,

05:42.084 --> 05:43.918
but the crime's gonna be gone.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.900
Baby's still running, huh?

05:59.902 --> 06:02.002
Better than you are.

06:02.004 --> 06:04.805
Whoa, man.

06:04.807 --> 06:06.006
A little early for that,
ain't it?

06:06.008 --> 06:07.541
Starting the day off right,
baby.

06:07.543 --> 06:08.843
I guess so.

06:08.845 --> 06:10.644
Let the good times roll, huh?

06:13.783 --> 06:15.484
God!

06:17.553 --> 06:19.520
It's depressing looking
at the old neighborhood, though.

06:19.522 --> 06:20.421
It's depressing.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.423
This used to be
almost a thriving place.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.691
It's too bad it's going down.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.527
It's turning into
a fucking war zone, man.

06:26.529 --> 06:29.463
I'll tell you what it is.
It's all those goddamn drugs.

06:29.465 --> 06:31.098
Say, about your truck, man...

06:31.100 --> 06:33.801
It's old,
but it's still running, right?

06:33.803 --> 06:35.903
At the moment.
Don't fucking...

06:35.905 --> 06:37.137
Don't... Don't say anything.

06:37.139 --> 06:39.206
It's old,
but it's still running, dude.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.642
Just like us...
old but still running.

06:52.188 --> 06:54.221
- See this?
- Yeah, I see it. What's...

06:54.223 --> 06:56.624
There's a bunch of punks
who have been hanging out there.

06:56.626 --> 06:57.992
Yeah.

06:57.994 --> 07:00.027
I started noticing
about two weeks ago,

07:00.029 --> 07:01.862
and there was just a couple
of them.

07:01.864 --> 07:03.530
- And now there's more and more.
- Druggies?

07:03.532 --> 07:04.565
I don't know what the fuck...

07:04.567 --> 07:06.700
Yeah, I'd say
they're drug addicts, for sure.

07:06.702 --> 07:08.802
There's a whole shitload
of them, too.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.474
But as long as they keep
over there...

07:14.110 --> 07:15.876
- Guess what, man.
- What?

07:15.878 --> 07:18.245
Birthday boy!

07:18.247 --> 07:21.081
- Fuck you.
- No, no. Birthday boy.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.517
Don't say nothing
about it, all right?

07:23.519 --> 07:25.085
I'm not the only one
who knows that.

07:25.087 --> 07:27.056
You think the other guys
don't know that?

07:48.010 --> 07:50.880
God! Shit!

07:51.547 --> 07:52.646
Oh, great.
We're here.

08:05.628 --> 08:07.127
I had a dream, Fred.

08:07.129 --> 08:10.531
You hit every goddamn pothole
in town.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.901
That was no dream.

08:13.903 --> 08:15.769
Oh, it was delib'ate, wasn't it?

08:15.771 --> 08:17.137
"Delib'ate"?
Where you from?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.751
Walter, hit the lights.

08:30.753 --> 08:33.055
Yep.
Got it.

08:38.694 --> 08:40.162
There you go.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.663
Son of a motherfucking whore.

09:49.665 --> 09:50.664
Uh-huh.

09:50.666 --> 09:53.067
This piece of shit's
on its last legs, Fred.

09:53.069 --> 09:55.938
Hey, Walter.
Walter, settle down, huh?

09:58.340 --> 10:00.375
Oh! Come on. Be gentle, man.

10:00.377 --> 10:02.643
I brought this all the way
from Bloody Ridge.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.079
Aw, one man and a big damn knife

10:05.081 --> 10:07.382
holding back
the Communist regime, huh?

10:07.384 --> 10:09.116
You used to like that story.

10:09.118 --> 10:12.086
I used to be able to get hard
without the blue pills, too.

10:12.088 --> 10:14.389
Read 'em and weep.

10:14.391 --> 10:16.123
- Yes, sir.
- Geez.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.158
- Lucky day. Come on.
- Do I need to ask?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.760
- The man's horny.
- Pop it in, buddy.

10:19.762 --> 10:21.797
The man's pathetic.

10:23.232 --> 10:24.932
Look at this.
Look at this.

10:24.934 --> 10:26.700
I'm looking. I'm looking.

10:26.702 --> 10:28.369
Oh, Lord.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.104
There we go.

10:30.106 --> 10:31.974
- Hold on there. Hold...
- What?

10:32.708 --> 10:34.007
You've been at this,
haven't you?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.876
- I have.
- Uh-huh.

10:35.878 --> 10:37.878
There's no telling
where his lips have been.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.214
Yeah. I don't remember myself.
You'd better wipe that twice.

10:40.216 --> 10:41.982
How about three times, will you?

10:41.984 --> 10:43.652
Oh, there you go.

10:45.455 --> 10:47.254
Here we go.

10:47.256 --> 10:49.089
To us.
Still here.

10:49.091 --> 10:52.126
- Still here.
- Still fuckin' here.

10:52.128 --> 10:54.962
I thought
you had that fixed, man.

10:54.964 --> 10:56.464
I thought I did, too, damn it.

10:56.466 --> 10:58.799
Shh. Come on.
This is my favorite part.

10:58.801 --> 11:00.769
- Standing in the way.
- You're blocking the man's view.

11:02.872 --> 11:04.738
Two. Three. Take it down.

11:04.740 --> 11:07.241
Come on. Reach!
Two. Three.

12:14.343 --> 12:17.144
Gentlemen!
My heroes.

12:17.146 --> 12:19.547
Whoo!

12:19.549 --> 12:21.416
What a great day, huh?

12:21.418 --> 12:22.883
Mm!

12:22.885 --> 12:24.151
Look at Lou,
all spruced up, man.

12:24.153 --> 12:25.052
Yeah.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.020
Did the Better Business Bureau

12:27.022 --> 12:28.822
close down Lou's Lemons?

12:28.824 --> 12:31.526
No business today on account
of it's a very special day.

12:31.528 --> 12:34.328
No, no. Not you too.
No way. No!

12:34.330 --> 12:36.431
On account of this being
a very special day,

12:36.433 --> 12:38.801
I need you to do me a favor.

12:39.335 --> 12:42.202
Let me get you
out of that ancient,

12:42.204 --> 12:44.037
rusted prehistoric truck.

12:44.039 --> 12:45.839
I'll pass.

12:45.841 --> 12:47.442
I'll give you 2%
off the sticker.

12:47.444 --> 12:48.576
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

12:48.578 --> 12:49.544
Two percent.

12:49.546 --> 12:52.580
One, because I love you
and you're my pal.

12:52.582 --> 12:54.415
Two, because it's your birthday.

12:54.417 --> 12:57.150
It's got to be a cash deal,
though, because...

12:57.152 --> 12:59.054
well, because
of your advanced age.

12:59.589 --> 13:03.824
Lay off him, Lou,
especially today.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.893
I can negotiate anything, huh?
I'm an animal.

13:06.895 --> 13:08.895
Yeah.
Goddamn snake.

13:08.897 --> 13:11.532
Ooh.

13:11.534 --> 13:14.402
Hey, hey.
You know what, Lou?

13:14.404 --> 13:16.471
You keep reminding me
it's my birthday...

13:16.473 --> 13:18.205
and this goes
for all of youse...

13:18.207 --> 13:20.408
I'll start reminding you
of your tabs.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.477
- Now, come on, man.
- Sure, he will. Sure, he will.

13:22.479 --> 13:25.446
Before you do, Zabriski's glass
looks a little light.

13:25.448 --> 13:27.314
Yeah. Excuse me.

13:27.316 --> 13:29.249
Glad somebody is looking out
for me.

13:29.251 --> 13:30.951
- Thank you, Doug. Ooh.
- I got you, buddy.

13:30.953 --> 13:32.620
Geez.

13:32.622 --> 13:35.889
You run over a fuckin' skunk
on the way here?

13:35.891 --> 13:38.292
- No. Upgraded, you know?
- Yeah?

13:38.294 --> 13:41.362
Medical. Yeah.
It's California green.

13:41.364 --> 13:43.297
What do you got,
some kind of condition?

13:43.299 --> 13:45.366
Nurse at the VA.

13:45.368 --> 13:46.967
Oh.
It's preexisting.

13:48.371 --> 13:51.104
I hear they got scientists
making that shit now.

13:51.106 --> 13:52.039
- Mm.
- Yeah.

13:52.041 --> 13:55.175
Bring a man
to a whole other dimension.

13:55.177 --> 13:57.445
I want some of that
science weed. Come on.

13:57.447 --> 13:59.946
Not that. You lipped it.
Get out of here.

14:01.984 --> 14:03.984
Yeah. I'll roll you a bone.

14:03.986 --> 14:05.386
One for Freddy.

14:05.388 --> 14:07.622
Maybe the old man
wants to join in, too.

14:07.624 --> 14:09.990
No, no, no, no.

14:09.992 --> 14:12.926
Only poison I'm going to put
into this wonderful body

14:12.928 --> 14:14.429
is right here.

14:14.431 --> 14:17.064
Maybe Freddy. Huh?
Roll one up for the occasion?

14:17.066 --> 14:18.198
Come on.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.132
You roll whatever you want,

14:19.134 --> 14:20.901
but how many times
do I have to tell you

14:20.903 --> 14:22.670
to take that shit outside, Doug?

14:22.672 --> 14:25.238
Huh? What's wrong with you?
What, are you high?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.239
Freddy.

14:28.378 --> 14:30.911
Hey, Freddy, how about we close
the bar down early tonight?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.312
What do you say?

14:32.314 --> 14:34.314
What do you say
we got customers here, huh?

14:34.316 --> 14:36.484
- I'll chase them off.
- You're the man for that.

14:36.486 --> 14:38.051
What do you got going on?

14:38.053 --> 14:40.287
The best birthday
that Freddy ever got.

14:46.028 --> 14:47.428
Fuckin' idiots.

14:47.430 --> 14:50.465
Fuckin' bunch of morons
is what you fuckin' are.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.744
Boz, that's more
than double what it's worth.

15:36.746 --> 15:38.479
Are you sure this is legit?

15:38.481 --> 15:40.748
You know Roadie's fucked this up
before.

15:40.750 --> 15:45.018
Jesus Christ.
Let <i>me</i> worry about <i>my</i> brother.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.053
Clear these hypers out of here.

15:47.055 --> 15:48.288
I don't want anything
fucking this up.

16:13.383 --> 16:15.750
These are shitty cigarettes.
You know that?

16:15.752 --> 16:18.352
You got shitty cigarettes.

16:18.354 --> 16:23.591
How come you don't got no
organic True 100s or something?

16:23.593 --> 16:26.326
I'll get right on it, Walter.

16:26.328 --> 16:29.296
Mm!
All right, gentlemen.

16:29.298 --> 16:33.401
Gather around the campfire,
because it's story time.

16:33.403 --> 16:36.637
The year... 1969.

16:36.639 --> 16:38.271
We're overseas.

16:38.273 --> 16:43.611
And this is when Fred was,
you know, not this exactly.

16:45.515 --> 16:49.484
I got a weekend of R&R
at some shitty fuel depot,

16:49.486 --> 16:54.054
and I'm drunk as a payday skunk,
and I see this guy coming, okay?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.523
Now, I hate the son of a bitch

16:55.525 --> 16:57.658
'cause he used to pitch
for the Rockets,

16:57.660 --> 17:00.060
which was two towns over,

17:00.062 --> 17:04.732
and he beaned me in the skull
with a fastball senior year.

17:04.734 --> 17:07.735
Boom! I go down, okay?

17:07.737 --> 17:09.336
And I'm...

17:09.338 --> 17:13.108
And... So I'm gonna take
this guy apart, but...

17:14.444 --> 17:16.109
You know where you are, kid?

17:16.111 --> 17:18.646
You're in the, uh, VFW post.

17:18.648 --> 17:20.247
Want me to check his ID, man?

17:20.249 --> 17:23.083
May be a situation
of stolen valor.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.552
Come on. Check it.
Just check it, man.

17:24.554 --> 17:26.854
No.
Be sure.

17:26.856 --> 17:29.724
All right, Abe.

17:29.726 --> 17:31.661
Uh-huh.

17:33.730 --> 17:35.195
What are you drinking?

17:35.197 --> 17:37.632
Beer, please.

17:37.634 --> 17:39.700
You leading a parade?

17:39.702 --> 17:42.503
Ha.
No.

17:42.505 --> 17:44.271
Buddy of mine told me,

17:44.273 --> 17:46.273
"If you wear your uniform
on the plane,

17:46.275 --> 17:48.509
they'll bump you up
to first class."

17:48.511 --> 17:49.677
Didn't happen.

17:51.213 --> 17:53.313
Hey, Walter,
this will shut you up.

17:53.315 --> 17:54.682
- Man just got home.
- Yes!

17:54.684 --> 17:56.817
- Oh, hey!
- Yes, sir!

17:56.819 --> 17:58.686
Don't think about reaching
for your wallet.

17:58.688 --> 18:00.688
Nobody pays first day back.

18:00.690 --> 18:03.290
Fred, gentlemen's preference
all around.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.426
I'll contribute to the cause.

18:05.428 --> 18:07.728
But not from that paint thinner
of the shelf.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.296
Up there.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.365
I was just getting
to the good part, guys.

18:11.367 --> 18:14.468
Yeah. You must have been
taking the scenic route.

18:14.470 --> 18:15.803
Hey, new fella.

18:15.805 --> 18:17.371
- Shawn.
- Shane.

18:17.373 --> 18:19.139
Shawn.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.708
Whatever.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.275
I don't even know you,

18:22.277 --> 18:24.579
but I know you're gonna
fuckin' love this.

18:24.581 --> 18:28.148
I knocked this motherfucker out
ice cold on the ground,

18:28.150 --> 18:32.753
and I'm looking down at him,
and I go, "Oh, shit!"

18:32.755 --> 18:36.156
'Cause I just realized
he is a fucking staff sergeant.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.758
He's got like seven ranks on me.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.227
I'm... I-I'm 19 years old.
I'm shitting myself.

18:41.229 --> 18:44.865
"Oh, fuck, I am court-martialed.
I am so dead."

18:44.867 --> 18:47.200
And what's the first words
out of your mouth?

18:47.202 --> 18:48.636
Fred, you remember
what you said?

18:48.638 --> 18:50.339
First words.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.709
I said, uh...

18:55.378 --> 18:59.847
"...Soldier...
you like American poontang?"

18:59.849 --> 19:01.882
Yes!

19:01.884 --> 19:03.718
That's right!

19:03.720 --> 19:05.285
That's what he said.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.722
I thought I knocked some marbles
loose.

19:07.724 --> 19:09.890
But no, he's got tickets
in his pocket

19:09.892 --> 19:12.526
for that night's USO show,

19:12.528 --> 19:18.264
where Miss 1963 is shaking her
mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

19:18.266 --> 19:19.767
Oh, it was glorious.

19:19.769 --> 19:21.569
It was.

19:21.571 --> 19:26.339
Freddy says he's taking so much
high heat from the Viet Cong

19:26.341 --> 19:29.910
that that little
red-white-and-blue right hook...

19:29.912 --> 19:32.312
<i>that</i> felt like home.

19:32.314 --> 19:33.914
He makes a couple
of phone calls,

19:33.916 --> 19:37.551
and first thing I know,
I'm transferred into his unit.

19:37.553 --> 19:41.355
And me and Lou over here
and Fred,

19:41.357 --> 19:43.958
we finished out our tours,
and we all come home together,

19:43.960 --> 19:46.594
and we...
we fart around in town.

19:46.596 --> 19:48.963
We're painting houses and shit.

19:48.965 --> 19:51.799
And then one day,
we say, "Fuck it,"

19:51.801 --> 19:55.670
and we take the first plane
back into the shit, you know?

19:55.672 --> 19:58.873
But that was...

19:58.875 --> 20:00.941
And that was enough for me,

20:00.943 --> 20:03.911
But... But Fred...
Holy cripes.

20:03.913 --> 20:05.546
He's... He keeps going.

20:05.548 --> 20:07.014
He goes like five tours of duty,
right?

20:07.016 --> 20:08.616
That's enough, Walter.
All right.

20:08.618 --> 20:10.384
You should have seen
this bastard over there.

20:10.386 --> 20:11.519
- All right.
- Alive, I fuckin' tell you.

20:11.521 --> 20:12.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Hey, hey.

20:12.822 --> 20:14.488
Let it go, huh?

20:14.490 --> 20:16.857
I'm just getting
to the big twist here, okay?

20:16.859 --> 20:18.359
Here comes the purple nurple.

20:18.361 --> 20:20.561
Miss 1963.

20:20.563 --> 20:22.965
Fred, you ever wonder
what happened to that girl?

20:23.733 --> 20:25.700
She got married.
She had a couple of kids.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.536
And one of them followed
in Mama's career path,

20:28.538 --> 20:30.538
and that is why
I'm going to ask you

20:30.540 --> 20:33.674
the same delicately phrased
question that you asked me

20:33.676 --> 20:35.776
all those years ago...

20:35.778 --> 20:39.413
Do you like American poontang?

20:39.415 --> 20:41.982
What is this?

20:41.984 --> 20:47.455
'Cause Miss 1963 had a kid
that's name is Crystal now,

20:47.457 --> 20:51.425
and she's dancing on the pole
tonight at midnight

20:51.427 --> 20:53.293
at the Deja Vu over on Lincoln.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.528
- Aw, come on.
- And we're all going.

20:54.530 --> 20:56.030
We're all going,

20:56.032 --> 20:58.632
and you can't say no
'cause this is a celebration,

20:58.634 --> 21:00.501
and we're not celebrating
in this shithole.

21:00.503 --> 21:01.936
Watering hole.

21:01.938 --> 21:04.805
Oh, geez.
Shitty watering hole.

21:04.807 --> 21:07.742
And you, my young friend,

21:07.744 --> 21:11.412
you are gonna get
a hero's homecoming.

21:11.414 --> 21:12.680
That's how.

21:12.682 --> 21:14.548
All right?

21:14.550 --> 21:16.316
I'm serious.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.918
So get your shit together.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.822
We leave at 2300 hours
or whenever I finish urinating,

21:21.824 --> 21:23.323
whichever comes first.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.892
No, no, no.

21:24.894 --> 21:26.727
That... That's it.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.334
She got no pussy hairs.

21:34.003 --> 21:34.835
Pardon?

21:34.837 --> 21:36.737
I like pussy hairs.

21:38.841 --> 21:41.944
What gives her the right
to cut off her pussy hairs?

21:42.779 --> 21:44.445
It's <i>her</i> pussy.

21:44.447 --> 21:47.815
I don't understand
how they get it so smooth,

21:47.817 --> 21:50.117
like a goddamn ice luge.

21:50.119 --> 21:51.852
Lasers.

21:51.854 --> 21:53.621
Laser... Of course!

21:53.623 --> 21:55.990
- The kid knows! Lasers!
- The kid knows. The kid knows.

21:55.992 --> 22:00.461
Moonraker, blasting cunt hairs
from outer space.

22:00.463 --> 22:01.864
Pew! Pew!

22:02.865 --> 22:03.998
You don't get it.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.933
Back in the day,

22:05.935 --> 22:09.103
I used to buy toothpicks
by the gross.

22:09.105 --> 22:10.471
Just in case.
You know what I'm saying?

22:11.908 --> 22:14.508
- Wait a minute.
- Am I having a stroke?

22:25.454 --> 22:27.721
If he says we need to move,
we need to move.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.390
Is everything else ready?

22:29.392 --> 22:32.428
Yeah, everything else
is ready to go.

22:54.150 --> 22:57.818
We got a major problem here.
They're out of control.

23:11.167 --> 23:12.800
All right.

23:12.802 --> 23:15.636
This place is fucked.

23:15.638 --> 23:18.105
Plan B.
I'll grab the stuff.

23:18.107 --> 23:19.907
Do what you got to do.

23:27.216 --> 23:28.718
Fuck!

23:30.853 --> 23:33.520
Oh, for fuck's sake.

23:36.759 --> 23:38.959
Who the fuck was in here?!

23:38.961 --> 23:40.162
Hey!

23:41.497 --> 23:42.999
Fuck.

23:45.101 --> 23:46.068
Lizard!

23:47.470 --> 23:49.803
Lizard!

24:02.018 --> 24:03.886
They don't know
what they're missing.

24:07.556 --> 24:09.191
This darkness...

24:13.095 --> 24:14.931
...it's perfect.

24:19.568 --> 24:21.470
It's peace.

24:29.645 --> 24:31.647
God damn it.

24:35.551 --> 24:37.718
I'm afraid
that's all she wrote, boys.

24:39.155 --> 24:41.221
Party's over.
Time to call it a day.

24:41.223 --> 24:44.124
Fred, I've been telling you
about this guy.

24:44.126 --> 24:46.894
This guy Eddie Harris, he's
the best electrician in town.

24:46.896 --> 24:49.196
He could rewire
this whole goddamn dump.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.731
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, he'll have it humming.

24:50.733 --> 24:52.566
Oh, yeah.
Or not.

24:52.568 --> 24:56.570
Hell, you might even be able
to serve beer when it's cold.

24:58.808 --> 25:02.977
Lou, if he's anything like the
plumber you sent over last time,

25:02.979 --> 25:04.545
keep his number.

25:09.018 --> 25:12.653
Don't say a fucking word.

25:12.655 --> 25:14.523
What did you do?

25:24.133 --> 25:25.134
Listen up.

25:27.169 --> 25:31.972
A filthy,
filthy little reptile...

25:31.974 --> 25:36.877
you all know her as Lizard...
has stolen your fix!

25:36.879 --> 25:39.179
Hype... all you want,

25:39.181 --> 25:42.783
enough to liquefy
your fucking tonsils...

25:42.785 --> 25:44.286
to whoever brings me the girl.

25:46.055 --> 25:51.060
Lizard's sister...
What purpose did that serve?

25:51.927 --> 25:53.660
She won't get away.

25:53.662 --> 25:55.229
The hypers will retrieve her.

25:55.231 --> 25:57.967
Half of them can barely walk.

26:00.803 --> 26:03.005
Don't underestimate them,
Gutter.

26:05.908 --> 26:08.342
You see...

26:08.344 --> 26:14.248
an army of brain-dead animals...
is still an army.

26:51.787 --> 26:53.921
Freddy, this will cheer you up.

26:53.923 --> 26:55.390
She's still dancing tonight.

26:55.392 --> 26:56.558
- Aw...
- No. Come on.

26:56.560 --> 26:59.827
No, Walt. I think I'm checking
out early and closing up.

26:59.829 --> 27:01.061
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:01.063 --> 27:02.930
Now, the taps,
they might be running, right?

27:02.932 --> 27:05.332
Yeah.
All right.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.401
One for the road.

27:06.403 --> 27:08.335
- Ranger?
- Yes, sir.

27:08.337 --> 27:11.772
Hey, soldier boy, don't you have
a baby's mama to go home to?

27:11.774 --> 27:15.309
No. I have a wife.
You got any extra toothpicks?

27:15.311 --> 27:17.445
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

27:20.349 --> 27:22.749
Lizard, get back here!

27:24.454 --> 27:26.188
Lizard!

27:30.059 --> 27:31.927
What the hell?

27:38.401 --> 27:39.900
Guys?

27:39.902 --> 27:41.235
- Hey!
- What?

27:41.237 --> 27:43.704
Fred, there's
this fucking girl...

27:45.207 --> 27:46.474
- Hey!
- Hey!

27:46.476 --> 27:49.877
God damn it, Lizard!
What the hell did you do?

27:49.879 --> 27:50.878
Hey!

27:52.415 --> 27:54.114
Jesus Christ!

27:54.116 --> 27:57.385
Christ!
Get down!

27:57.387 --> 27:59.153
No!

28:13.202 --> 28:15.871
Son of a bitch piece of trash.

28:19.775 --> 28:22.075
Shit. Shit.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.379
Doug, man.

28:24.381 --> 28:27.948
What in the cocksucking fuck
just went on here?

28:27.950 --> 28:29.750
Oh, Fred. Fred.

28:29.752 --> 28:31.419
Oh, C-Christ!

28:31.421 --> 28:33.921
F-Fred... I'm dead.

28:33.923 --> 28:35.322
No, you're not dead.
You hang in there.

28:35.324 --> 28:37.492
You hear me, brother?
You hang in there!

28:37.494 --> 28:39.226
Here.
Help me out here, boys.

28:39.228 --> 28:41.396
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

28:41.398 --> 28:45.098
Whoa, whoa. Go... No, no.
Go real easy. Real easy.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.368
That shoulder looks like
it's hanging by a thread.

28:47.370 --> 28:49.236
Oh, wonderful.

28:49.238 --> 28:51.205
Sit him up.
All right. Here we go.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.242
Lift. Lift. Here we go.

28:54.343 --> 28:56.143
- Over to here.
- To the bar.

28:56.145 --> 28:58.111
- Come on. Watch. Watch his head.
- I got him. I got him.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.214
- I got... Don't worry.
- A little higher.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.149
- Watch his head. Watch his head.
- Higher.

29:02.151 --> 29:03.884
Good.

29:03.886 --> 29:05.420
Kid, go shut the door,
will you?

29:05.422 --> 29:06.521
We got you.

29:06.523 --> 29:09.056
You got to get
a tourniquet on there, man.

29:09.058 --> 29:10.525
All right.
Keep this open.

29:10.527 --> 29:12.527
- You stay with us.
- Don't worry about me.

29:12.529 --> 29:14.495
- Where did the kid...
- Hold that arm up.

29:14.497 --> 29:16.230
Dougie, open your eyes.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.499
Doug, you hear me?
I want your eyes open.

29:20.903 --> 29:24.204
You're coming with me, bitch!

29:24.206 --> 29:26.039
Hey, punk!

29:37.853 --> 29:39.019
I got this, kid.

29:39.021 --> 29:41.088
This is for Doug, you fuck!

29:41.090 --> 29:43.558
Yeah!
That's right!

29:43.560 --> 29:45.261
Fuck!

29:47.296 --> 29:49.932
Fuckin' punk fuck!

29:51.434 --> 29:52.899
Breathe.

29:52.901 --> 29:55.135
It's like patching
a busted water main.

29:55.137 --> 29:57.104
See?
This ain't working, huh?

29:57.106 --> 29:58.905
- Yes, it is. Just breathe.
- Easy, Doug.

30:01.544 --> 30:04.211
What the fuck is going on
out there?!

30:04.213 --> 30:06.947
Hey, kid, check that side door.

30:06.949 --> 30:09.318
Easy.
Easy, easy.

30:10.052 --> 30:12.119
- You all right?
- Yeah.

30:14.990 --> 30:17.960
Anybody else
want to come in my bar?!

30:24.066 --> 30:25.566
Oh! God!

30:37.112 --> 30:38.446
Hard line.
Other way out?

30:38.448 --> 30:39.447
At the hall?

30:39.449 --> 30:41.416
All right. All right.
Move your ass. Let's go!

30:41.418 --> 30:42.417
- Okay.
- Come on.

30:46.356 --> 30:49.524
Jesus Christ.
Where's your head at, Lou?

30:49.526 --> 30:51.291
- I got blood all over me.
- We need a better tourniquet.

30:51.293 --> 30:52.926
- Give me your belt.
- It's alligator skin.

30:52.928 --> 30:55.831
Give me your fuckin' belt,
or I'll strangle you with it.

31:01.471 --> 31:04.340
Jesus.

31:08.911 --> 31:10.079
How's he doing?

31:10.613 --> 31:13.080
Not good.

31:13.082 --> 31:15.616
Well, you keep him breathing.

31:15.618 --> 31:17.385
We're bugging out the back.

31:17.387 --> 31:18.653
Yes, sir.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.355
Easy.
Okay.

31:20.357 --> 31:21.957
- A little tighter.
- Yeah, a little tighter.

31:27.364 --> 31:30.063
What do we got out there?

31:30.065 --> 31:31.399
Looks clear.

31:31.401 --> 31:33.333
All right.
Fuck this.

31:33.335 --> 31:34.669
I'll pull my car around.

31:34.671 --> 31:37.572
We'll get Doug in,
and we all leave and eat.

31:49.284 --> 31:50.585
Whoa!

31:50.587 --> 31:51.586
- Shit!
- Holy shit!

32:01.664 --> 32:04.066
Get in there!

32:15.578 --> 32:18.046
Where's Z?

32:19.482 --> 32:20.383
He's dead.

32:25.187 --> 32:27.020
What the hell is going on here,
man?!

32:27.022 --> 32:28.556
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

32:28.558 --> 32:30.691
I mean, that trash
comes rushing in here,

32:30.693 --> 32:33.293
and all of a sudden it's like
Khe Sanh all over again.

32:33.295 --> 32:35.095
I mean, those animals outside,

32:35.097 --> 32:37.230
don't they know we're
supposed to be at the titty bar?

32:37.232 --> 32:38.666
We're supposed to be celebrating
Freddy's birthday!

32:38.668 --> 32:42.068
Lou!
Shut your fuckin' yap!

32:42.070 --> 32:43.571
There's nothing more we can do
for him here.

32:43.573 --> 32:45.673
We got to get him to a hospital
<i>now.</i>

32:45.675 --> 32:47.575
All right.
We're gonna.

32:47.577 --> 32:49.176
Look, Abe.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.646
Look, there's clean rags
behind the bar.

32:51.648 --> 32:53.648
You keep pressure
on that shoulder.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.416
Just... You keep him breathing.

32:55.418 --> 32:58.318
The rest of you,
secure the doors.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.021
What do we do, just sit here
with our thumbs up our asses?

33:01.023 --> 33:02.557
Hey, Lou.
It's gonna be all right.

33:02.559 --> 33:05.760
The smaller force acts while
the larger force regroups.

33:05.762 --> 33:08.496
I'm gonna bring the truck
right up to the door.

33:08.498 --> 33:10.197
We're gonna get him in it,

33:10.199 --> 33:12.366
and we're gonna get ourselves
out of here alive.

33:12.368 --> 33:14.402
- Roger that.
- All right. Let's move.

33:14.404 --> 33:16.437
Time's on their side
not on ours.

33:16.439 --> 33:18.806
It sure as shit
is not on Doug's.

33:18.808 --> 33:20.508
Let's do it.

33:20.510 --> 33:23.478
Get that pool table over here.
Barricade it, all right?

33:57.547 --> 33:59.212
Come on!

34:13.128 --> 34:14.662
Fred.

34:14.664 --> 34:17.565
Hey.
Listen.

34:17.567 --> 34:21.502
You and me both know
this ain't the only option.

34:21.504 --> 34:24.170
We can push Miss Teen USA
right back out the front door

34:24.172 --> 34:25.673
the way she came in.

34:25.675 --> 34:27.677
Is that the man you want to be,
Walter?

34:29.746 --> 34:31.748
Well...

34:33.850 --> 34:36.684
All right. Look.
I got your six.

34:36.686 --> 34:38.419
Get to your truck

34:38.421 --> 34:41.221
and get your ass to
the police station ricky-ticky.

34:41.223 --> 34:44.392
Hey, uh, you said something
a little while ago.

34:44.394 --> 34:46.761
It was like, uh, "Oh, you should
have seen that bastard

34:46.763 --> 34:48.194
when we were over there.

34:48.196 --> 34:49.764
- He was alive."
- Yeah.

34:49.766 --> 34:52.132
I'll tell you something,
brother.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.267
I'm feeling pretty fucking alive
right now.

34:54.269 --> 34:56.704
Yeah.
We're trying to stay that way.

36:14.617 --> 36:16.819
God damn it.

36:22.392 --> 36:24.224
Aah! Aah!

36:26.896 --> 36:28.663
Give it back.

36:28.665 --> 36:29.730
What?

36:29.732 --> 36:32.400
Give... it... back.

36:33.736 --> 36:35.872
I don't know
what you're talking about!

36:37.006 --> 36:39.473
Then you die.

36:45.615 --> 36:48.751
Come on, bitch!
Come on!

36:58.461 --> 37:00.961
Fred.
Fred, you all right?

37:00.963 --> 37:03.497
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.

37:03.499 --> 37:04.665
- Appreciate it, Walter.
- Jesus.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.000
Really appreciate it.

37:07.370 --> 37:10.205
Shit. That was...
Oh, shit.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.874
- All right.
- I got the one on the left.

37:16.879 --> 37:18.546
Fred! Walter!
Come on!

37:18.548 --> 37:19.880
These things are crawling
all over the place!

37:19.882 --> 37:21.982
Come on!

37:29.324 --> 37:30.323
Fuck.

37:30.325 --> 37:31.894
Oh, Jesus.

37:32.695 --> 37:34.564
Oh, my God.

37:39.569 --> 37:41.702
You got a piece.

37:41.704 --> 37:42.939
I do.

37:44.607 --> 37:46.373
You're good with it.

37:46.375 --> 37:48.809
75th Ranger Regiment, sir.

37:48.811 --> 37:50.845
Some of the guys
took to calling me Dead Eye.

37:50.847 --> 37:52.713
That is a clever moniker.

37:52.715 --> 37:56.352
Well... Dead Eye, I'm...

37:57.687 --> 38:00.788
...I'm glad you were in the mood
for a beer tonight.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.322
That makes one of us.

38:02.324 --> 38:03.659
Now what?

38:04.894 --> 38:06.794
Now the girl talks.

38:06.796 --> 38:08.629
Two hours and nothing.

38:08.631 --> 38:10.564
Don't you think the police
would have heard something?

38:10.566 --> 38:12.967
What? In this neighborhood?
Gunshots are like crickets.

38:12.969 --> 38:14.302
It's like background noise.

38:14.871 --> 38:17.004
Cavalry ain't coming, Lou.

38:17.006 --> 38:19.375
It's Q&A time, kid.

38:20.810 --> 38:21.677
Sit!

38:23.579 --> 38:24.645
What's your name?

38:24.647 --> 38:26.781
Elizabeth.
Call me Lizard.

38:26.783 --> 38:28.516
Well, my name is Fred.

38:28.518 --> 38:31.385
And see, the problem is
that me and my old friends

38:31.387 --> 38:34.121
are probably gonna die tonight
unless you help us out

38:34.123 --> 38:36.724
to understand
what's happening here.

38:36.726 --> 38:38.659
Couple minutes ago,
some woman tried to kill me

38:38.661 --> 38:39.960
in the parking lot.

38:39.962 --> 38:43.697
But what really pissed me off
is that bitch trashed my truck,

38:43.699 --> 38:48.571
and, Lizard,
I really, really love my truck.

38:49.639 --> 38:51.874
She also said to me,
"Give it back."

38:52.942 --> 38:54.108
What's that supposed to mean?

38:54.110 --> 38:58.112
She didn't say, "Give her back,"
or, "Give Lizard back."

38:58.114 --> 38:59.980
No, no.
She said, "Give it back."

38:59.982 --> 39:02.852
So what is "it"?
Huh?

39:04.620 --> 39:05.988
Hard case.

39:08.090 --> 39:09.790
When she came in...
anybody see?...

39:09.792 --> 39:11.425
was she carrying something
with her?

39:11.427 --> 39:13.460
- Not that I saw.
- No, I didn't see shit, man.

39:13.462 --> 39:15.930
I was busy focusing on this jerk
trying to cut off Doug's arm.

39:15.932 --> 39:18.699
Why don't you quit
this true-grit bullshit

39:18.701 --> 39:20.434
and just throw her out the door?

39:20.436 --> 39:22.770
I mean, maybe you got this
merciful stuff still in you,

39:22.772 --> 39:24.972
but I don't have it in my body
anymore.

39:24.974 --> 39:26.807
Now, you...

39:26.809 --> 39:28.576
- Hey. Whoa.
- ...you speak, honey,

39:28.578 --> 39:30.077
or I'm gonna lace
right into you.

39:30.079 --> 39:32.580
You're not gonna lace
into anybody.

39:32.582 --> 39:34.748
- This is my joint, all right?
- Neither are you, man.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.886
Fuck!

39:37.620 --> 39:39.186
Shit!

39:39.188 --> 39:41.657
All right. All right.
It's nothing.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.191
All right?

39:44.193 --> 39:45.492
Sorry.

39:45.494 --> 39:47.530
Go on.
Clean yourself up.

39:48.598 --> 39:50.499
Your own fault!

39:51.467 --> 39:53.736
- It's his own fault.
- Yeah.

39:56.038 --> 39:58.505
Give me some good news.

39:58.507 --> 40:00.808
Eliminated one man.
Couldn't get inside.

40:00.810 --> 40:02.678
Where's Roadie?

40:03.779 --> 40:06.983
He's dead.
Bartender shot him.

40:34.176 --> 40:35.978
Yeah.

40:37.013 --> 40:39.813
That's when you used to be fine,
Fred.

40:50.159 --> 40:51.861
Shit.

40:55.765 --> 40:57.932
Well.

40:57.934 --> 40:58.966
Hey.

40:58.968 --> 41:01.101
Little Miss Bo Peep here,

41:01.103 --> 41:03.539
she's been playing
hide-and-seek with us.

41:05.975 --> 41:07.942
Oh.

41:07.944 --> 41:09.510
Geez.

41:09.512 --> 41:11.914
God.

41:13.182 --> 41:14.248
How much is this?

41:14.250 --> 41:16.216
That is a whole fuckin' lot.
That's what that is.

41:16.218 --> 41:18.754
It's enough
to kill the kid over.

41:19.755 --> 41:22.058
Hey.
Did you steal this?

41:25.227 --> 41:27.761
Boz killed my sister, all right?

41:27.763 --> 41:31.165
This, though, it's all he's got,
this whole fucking life.

41:31.167 --> 41:33.767
Well, there it is...
We just give this back,

41:33.769 --> 41:36.770
and the nightmare ends, and then
we can go to the titty bar,

41:36.772 --> 41:40.107
- where we're supposed to be.
- It doesn't work like that.

41:40.109 --> 41:42.109
That guy over there
with the exploded fucking head,

41:42.111 --> 41:45.612
that's Roadie,
Boz's little brother.

41:45.614 --> 41:49.685
"VFW."

41:50.853 --> 41:52.886
What the fuck is that?

41:52.888 --> 41:55.089
Veterans of Foreign Wars.

41:55.091 --> 41:57.893
Soldiers?
Good.

41:59.829 --> 42:01.762
Soldiers are good at dying.

42:01.764 --> 42:03.731
You guys murdered
his little brother.

42:03.733 --> 42:06.033
- Now, Boz won't stop until he...
- Killed every one of us, right?

42:06.035 --> 42:08.168
Yeah, and your kids
and your grandkids

42:08.170 --> 42:10.904
and... your great-grandkids.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.706
Jesus Christ.
How fuckin' old are you guys?

42:12.708 --> 42:13.807
Screw you, bitch.

42:13.809 --> 42:17.244
Oh, pump the brakes
on the old-guy stuff, all right?

42:17.246 --> 42:19.780
I don't know about this murder.
Could be manslaughter.

42:19.782 --> 42:20.914
He came in with a big damn ax.

42:20.916 --> 42:23.283
Jesus Christ, Walter!
What the hell is the difference?

42:23.285 --> 42:25.586
I feel like I'm in
the twilight zone, okay?

42:25.588 --> 42:27.654
Because this little girl here,
this little child,

42:27.656 --> 42:30.224
she is dictating to us
what's gonna go down!

42:30.226 --> 42:32.226
Maybe your sister,
maybe that little junkie

42:32.228 --> 42:34.194
- deserved to fucking get it.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

42:34.196 --> 42:36.697
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off!

42:36.699 --> 42:39.133
Hey!
This is my post, my rules.

42:39.135 --> 42:41.702
You don't like it, then
walk the hell out of here, huh?

42:41.704 --> 42:44.004
- Let's put her outside the...
- Crying out loud!

42:44.006 --> 42:46.106
Shut up, Lou.

42:46.108 --> 42:48.978
Hey.
Here.

42:49.812 --> 42:52.946
You were a soldier.
You were a good soldier.

42:52.948 --> 42:55.049
So were we all, weren't we?

42:55.051 --> 42:57.885
So let's act like it.

42:57.887 --> 42:59.955
We set a perimeter.

43:01.023 --> 43:02.289
We make our stand.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.691
Remember the Alamo.

43:04.693 --> 43:06.727
Yeah, but they all died
at the Alamo.

43:06.729 --> 43:08.262
- Yeah.
- Dumb shit.

43:10.633 --> 43:11.433
All right.

43:11.435 --> 43:13.901
I got nine rounds
for the 12-gauge.

43:13.903 --> 43:16.236
- Ranger?
- I got three left in the .45.

43:16.238 --> 43:18.205
I got a big damn fire ax,

43:18.207 --> 43:20.974
and Doug can attest
to the effectiveness of that.

43:20.976 --> 43:22.709
So, what do you think, kid?

43:22.711 --> 43:24.344
It's not enough.

43:24.346 --> 43:26.282
We'd better get to work.

43:43.866 --> 43:46.667
Hey.
How are you with this?

43:46.669 --> 43:49.036
No, I got this.
I got this.

43:49.038 --> 43:49.870
You sure?

43:49.872 --> 43:51.972
They didn't get
my trigger finger.

44:08.891 --> 44:10.159
Huh.

44:21.103 --> 44:23.404
Be good to me, Gordie.

44:43.893 --> 44:46.793
Ooh, boy.

44:46.795 --> 44:48.429
Right up his ass.

44:48.431 --> 44:50.099
Bring 'em.

44:51.233 --> 44:53.233
This little piggy went
to market.

44:53.235 --> 44:55.037
I don't want to tell you
where that one's gonna go.

45:00.176 --> 45:02.377
Here we go. Little more.
Little more. Little more.

45:17.360 --> 45:22.129
See, the trick is to get
the snap and the flick

45:22.131 --> 45:27.937
all in one very cool...
very fluid motion.

45:30.407 --> 45:31.939
I used to be good at it,

45:31.941 --> 45:36.810
but, uh, my fingers
are getting kind of stiff.

45:38.448 --> 45:41.048
This place is kind of gross.

45:41.050 --> 45:44.985
This place is our VFW Post 2494.

45:44.987 --> 45:46.421
What's that mean?

45:46.423 --> 45:49.890
It means it's... a home.

45:49.892 --> 45:51.258
At least for me, it is.

45:51.260 --> 45:54.462
And for the rest of these bums.

45:54.464 --> 45:59.800
See, when we got back from Nam,
we just kind of gravitated,

45:59.802 --> 46:05.040
you know, washed up here
like some kind of a tide.

46:08.143 --> 46:10.578
There used to be more of us.

46:10.580 --> 46:13.215
There used to be a lot more
of us, but...

46:14.417 --> 46:17.150
What was it like over there?

46:17.152 --> 46:19.152
- Nam?
- Yeah.

46:22.258 --> 46:24.093
I remember the mud.

46:25.362 --> 46:28.030
And the crawling in the mud.

46:30.099 --> 46:32.234
A lot of men died in the mud.

46:33.370 --> 46:35.271
I hated the fucking mud.

46:38.408 --> 46:41.975
Now, uh, Abe, you know, he's...

46:41.977 --> 46:43.245
Ow.

46:44.980 --> 46:47.047
You know, he's the, uh,
old sourpuss

46:47.049 --> 46:50.418
with all the charm
of a clawhammer.

46:50.420 --> 46:52.085
He wasn't in Nam.

46:52.087 --> 46:54.622
Nah.
He's Korea.

46:54.624 --> 46:57.124
Different war, same shit.

46:57.126 --> 46:58.292
Same mud?

46:58.294 --> 47:00.528
Yeah.

47:00.530 --> 47:03.364
Same mud, except his was frozen.

47:05.334 --> 47:09.470
Yeah, and Old Ranger Rick...
you know, Shawn...

47:09.472 --> 47:13.040
he just got back
from the desert.

47:13.042 --> 47:14.609
No mud over there.

47:14.611 --> 47:17.380
Just a whole shitload of sand.

47:18.415 --> 47:20.349
Don't matter where you fought.

47:21.116 --> 47:25.319
You make it back,
you got a home right here.

47:40.670 --> 47:42.570
You ready?

47:42.572 --> 47:44.938
Don't get killed
by those antlers.

47:44.940 --> 47:46.441
They'll poke your eyeballs out.

47:46.443 --> 47:49.178
Yeah. No problem.
No problem.

47:55.452 --> 47:57.284
All right.

47:57.286 --> 47:59.354
Don't kill them all at once,
now.

47:59.356 --> 48:01.154
Fuck it.

48:01.156 --> 48:03.460
Now I'm not gonna leave
any of them for you.

48:04.993 --> 48:07.595
I like the sound of that,
Gordie.

48:07.597 --> 48:11.100
Hey. Here.
I got something for you.

48:13.370 --> 48:14.637
Ooh.

48:16.171 --> 48:18.305
You know,
I think we're gonna be fine

48:18.307 --> 48:21.210
as long as they come at us
on skates.

48:39.328 --> 48:42.430
Well...

48:42.432 --> 48:45.466
I imagine we're gonna have
some company any time now,

48:45.468 --> 48:48.436
so why don't you get yourself
behind the bar

48:48.438 --> 48:49.236
and look out for Doug?

48:49.238 --> 48:50.738
No, no, no.
I can... I can help.

48:50.740 --> 48:52.305
No doubt.

48:52.307 --> 48:55.376
You'll be helping
by looking out for Doug.

48:55.378 --> 48:57.978
And if shit goes sideways...

48:57.980 --> 48:59.514
I'll kill them.

48:59.516 --> 49:01.584
I knew you were a hard case.

49:23.138 --> 49:25.138
Come on, motherfucker.

49:36.753 --> 49:38.553
Ah.
Let 'em come.

49:38.555 --> 49:40.721
Here we go.

49:43.225 --> 49:45.125
- I got to help!
- Relax. Relax.

49:45.127 --> 49:46.794
- T-They're my friends!
- They're gonna be all right.

49:46.796 --> 49:48.261
You're good. Just relax.

50:05.782 --> 50:07.347
Get to the grenades!

50:07.349 --> 50:09.717
- Yeah. I got this.
- Get it out!

50:09.719 --> 50:12.420
- Light that for me, will you?
- No. That's not good for you.

50:12.422 --> 50:14.622
Oh, come on.
Are you fucking kidding me, kid?

50:14.624 --> 50:15.656
It's medical.

50:28.371 --> 50:29.804
- Are we winning?
- Yeah.

50:29.806 --> 50:31.173
Your friends are kicking ass.

50:42.719 --> 50:44.454
Aah!

51:01.871 --> 51:03.437
Hey!

51:07.577 --> 51:10.212
Aah!

51:11.346 --> 51:12.813
Come on, Lou!

51:12.815 --> 51:14.281
Jesus Christ.

51:14.283 --> 51:15.883
Sorry, Gordie.

51:20.289 --> 51:22.790
A little... A little help here.

51:34.269 --> 51:35.770
Fuckin' hippie.

51:35.772 --> 51:37.405
Here.
You dropped this.

51:37.407 --> 51:38.606
Aah!

51:56.826 --> 51:59.660
Oh. Whoa. I got you.
I got you.

51:59.662 --> 52:00.895
I got you.

52:00.897 --> 52:02.763
What, you're my fucking savior
now?

52:08.905 --> 52:13.273
Now I got blood <i>and</i> pickled
pork shit on my jacket.

52:13.275 --> 52:14.442
Well, you look good.

52:14.444 --> 52:15.776
Thanks.

52:17.312 --> 52:18.111
Hey.

52:18.113 --> 52:19.279
You're gonna have
to walk it off.

52:19.281 --> 52:22.182
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, man.
- Take a seat right there.

52:22.184 --> 52:23.818
Everybody in one piece?

52:23.820 --> 52:25.920
Well, let me check.
Yep.

52:43.338 --> 52:44.339
Oh, shit.

53:38.027 --> 53:40.728
Oh, shit.

53:40.730 --> 53:41.662
Come on.

53:41.664 --> 53:43.964
- Oh, God. Hey. Good j...
- You all right?

53:43.966 --> 53:45.900
Oh, good job.
I'll tell you.

53:45.902 --> 53:49.003
That son of bitch
stoved my chest in.

53:49.005 --> 53:50.671
Any more of these
prehistoric creatures

53:50.673 --> 53:51.872
coming through that door?

53:51.874 --> 53:53.574
Get those doors barricaded.

53:53.576 --> 53:55.609
Let's use those bodies
as sandbags, all right?

53:55.611 --> 53:56.412
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

53:56.979 --> 53:59.214
It's taking too long.

54:01.451 --> 54:03.986
The old men must have killed
Tank.

54:06.489 --> 54:08.391
Fuck.

54:10.292 --> 54:12.026
Sun's up soon.

54:12.028 --> 54:14.262
If we don't get inside,
it's over.

54:20.536 --> 54:23.003
Load up.

54:23.005 --> 54:26.308
Heavy stuff.
Hard stuff.

54:29.579 --> 54:31.914
I'm tired
of fucking playing games.

55:08.084 --> 55:11.821
Thanks for saving my life,
Elizabeth.

55:12.889 --> 55:15.623
I started this.

55:15.625 --> 55:18.559
Let's finish it.

55:20.963 --> 55:23.633
Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

55:25.401 --> 55:27.134
You only winged him.

55:27.136 --> 55:29.605
Are you losing your touch?

55:30.072 --> 55:32.773
Don't... Don't make...
Don't make me laugh.

55:32.775 --> 55:34.844
It... It hurts a lot.

55:38.147 --> 55:39.980
Oh.

55:39.982 --> 55:42.416
I think it's time to call
this game.

55:45.087 --> 55:47.488
- No way, brother.
- One more for the road.

55:47.490 --> 55:51.659
I'll give you one more,
but... it's not for the road.

55:51.661 --> 55:54.161
It's for my birthday, remember?
It's my birthday.

55:54.163 --> 55:55.830
Well, listen.
I'm older than you.

55:55.832 --> 55:57.967
Y-You got to listen to me
right now, so...

55:58.634 --> 56:00.668
- Happy birthday.
- Yes.

56:05.808 --> 56:07.510
You're all right.

56:23.526 --> 56:24.894
Hey, kid.

56:27.563 --> 56:30.399
You know what I said, uh,
when you first came in?

56:30.933 --> 56:32.867
Yeah.

56:32.869 --> 56:33.901
Okay.

56:33.903 --> 56:37.071
Well, when you get to be my age,

56:37.073 --> 56:39.375
people don't really give a shit
what you say.

56:39.842 --> 56:41.377
I'll just be ready.

56:42.044 --> 56:44.011
I'd like the chance to get
to your age, old man.

56:46.015 --> 56:47.581
- Lou.
- Yeah.

56:47.583 --> 56:50.718
You know that bag she brought
in here full of shit?

56:50.720 --> 56:52.019
Yeah.

56:52.021 --> 56:55.890
What if you had all of that
in cash?

56:55.892 --> 56:58.692
Cash.
Cold, hard cash.

56:58.694 --> 57:00.429
What would you do with that?

57:00.963 --> 57:03.197
- You know what I'd do...
- Mm?

57:03.199 --> 57:05.466
...with all those funds
from that garbage?

57:05.468 --> 57:07.534
Yeah.

57:07.536 --> 57:13.073
I'd buy each one of us
a really nice casket...

57:13.075 --> 57:18.512
gold trim, extra cushion,
Tempur-Pedic foam.

57:18.514 --> 57:19.880
Uh-huh.

57:19.882 --> 57:21.982
The best money could buy

57:21.984 --> 57:27.221
so that we'd all be cozy,
like two little bears in a glen,

57:27.223 --> 57:29.556
after we die.

57:29.558 --> 57:32.159
You know what?

57:32.161 --> 57:34.897
Your foxhole chitchat
needs work.

57:37.833 --> 57:40.503
Jesus.
Fuck.

57:42.905 --> 57:44.972
Lou's sliding off the deep end.

57:44.974 --> 57:47.708
He's gonna be Section 8
any minute now.

57:47.710 --> 57:48.876
We got to hold him.

57:48.878 --> 57:51.578
No. No, no.
That ain't the way.

57:51.580 --> 57:53.514
Look, those fuckers,
they got to be hurting, too.

57:53.516 --> 57:55.816
I'm gonna go out there.
I'm gonna make a run for it.

57:55.818 --> 57:58.018
- Fred. Oh, wait a minute.
- I'm gonna make a lot of noise.

57:58.020 --> 58:00.154
I'm gonna draw them off,
and you get Doug to my truck

58:00.156 --> 58:01.922
and get him
the hell out of here.

58:01.924 --> 58:03.223
Fred, you ain't gonna make it
two blocks

58:03.225 --> 58:04.359
without them being all over you.

58:04.361 --> 58:07.695
Well, Walter, you telling me
you got a better idea?!

58:07.697 --> 58:09.063
Dougie's dying on the bar!

58:09.065 --> 58:11.031
You think I'm gonna let him
just bleed out there?

58:11.033 --> 58:14.134
- That ain't gonna happen!
- Fred! Fred! Fred!

58:14.136 --> 58:16.003
- Oh, shit.
- The fuck is this?

58:16.005 --> 58:17.604
Fred!

58:17.606 --> 58:18.539
You piece of shit!

58:18.541 --> 58:20.007
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

58:20.009 --> 58:20.908
Give it back!

58:20.910 --> 58:23.544
Hey! Hey! Knock it off.
Knock it off.

58:23.546 --> 58:25.612
- What's going on? Stop it.
- Give it back!

58:25.614 --> 58:26.880
What's going on?

58:26.882 --> 58:29.016
I can negotiate us
out of this mess.

58:29.018 --> 58:30.884
- No.
- I can.

58:30.886 --> 58:33.589
I can do what you can't do.

58:34.323 --> 58:37.658
Just... Just have a little faith
in me, okay?

58:37.660 --> 58:39.128
- Lou.
- Just this once.

58:41.197 --> 58:43.731
Lou, you, uh...

58:43.733 --> 58:47.868
That bag is the only thing
that's keeping us alive, right?

58:47.870 --> 58:50.070
You give that up,

58:50.072 --> 58:53.207
they'll torch this place
like a matchbox.

58:53.209 --> 58:55.644
You understand that, don't you?

59:10.026 --> 59:11.291
Good man.

59:11.293 --> 59:13.827
All right.
Whew!

59:13.829 --> 59:15.729
What a day, huh?

59:15.731 --> 59:19.733
Listen. Why don't you secure
the door and come on over here?

59:19.735 --> 59:22.171
Let's have a...
Let's have a shot, huh?

59:25.141 --> 59:27.174
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

59:27.176 --> 59:29.078
I'll tell you that.

59:31.147 --> 59:32.646
Hey! Hey! Lou!

59:32.648 --> 59:33.914
Where the hell are you going,
man?

59:33.916 --> 59:35.383
I'll be back.

59:35.385 --> 59:40.022
After all...
we got a birthday to celebrate.

59:41.991 --> 59:43.624
Lou!

59:43.626 --> 59:45.626
Lou, wait!

1:00:09.051 --> 1:00:10.184
He's out of his fucking mind.

1:00:10.186 --> 1:00:11.985
He's a used-car salesman.

1:00:11.987 --> 1:00:15.656
Yeah. He's got that goddamn
pussy party on his brain.

1:00:15.658 --> 1:00:17.124
Let's make a deal.

1:00:17.126 --> 1:00:19.427
Let's close a deal.

1:00:19.429 --> 1:00:23.864
I mean... how can I get you
in this car today, huh?

1:00:23.866 --> 1:00:25.368
Sure.

1:00:26.135 --> 1:00:28.702
Hey.
I'm... I'm not armed.

1:00:28.704 --> 1:00:30.405
I came to have a conversation
man-to-man.

1:00:30.407 --> 1:00:33.408
So... what's your offer?

1:00:33.410 --> 1:00:34.576
Easy exchange.

1:00:34.578 --> 1:00:40.114
We'll give you back your, uh...
you know, your drugs.

1:00:40.116 --> 1:00:43.750
You can go on your way and...
and we'll go on ours.

1:00:43.752 --> 1:00:44.620
Intriguing.

1:00:45.721 --> 1:00:50.190
Ultimately unacceptable
but intriguing.

1:00:50.192 --> 1:00:54.362
There's only one
satisfactory solution,

1:00:54.364 --> 1:00:58.401
and that is we get our product
back and each of you die.

1:01:01.904 --> 1:01:06.275
Um... how about meet me halfway?

1:01:07.276 --> 1:01:10.811
I mean, negotiate with me.
This is what I do.

1:01:10.813 --> 1:01:14.281
Y-You know Lou's Used?

1:01:14.283 --> 1:01:18.285
Maybe you've seen some of my,
um, my ads on TV.

1:01:18.287 --> 1:01:21.255
The little blond girl saying,
"Want something ..."

1:01:21.257 --> 1:01:23.726
"You need something new?
Call Lou."

1:01:24.293 --> 1:01:26.394
I'm Lou.

1:01:26.396 --> 1:01:28.363
That's me.

1:01:28.365 --> 1:01:30.065
I'm not familiar.

1:01:33.002 --> 1:01:36.439
Mind if we talk honestly
for a second?

1:01:39.442 --> 1:01:40.976
Um...

1:01:42.845 --> 1:01:46.880
A friend inside there
has, uh, has kind of lost it.

1:01:46.882 --> 1:01:49.950
I mean, he thinks he's still
the... the platoon commander

1:01:49.952 --> 1:01:51.352
back in the fuckin' jungles,
you know?

1:01:51.354 --> 1:01:52.221
Ugh.

1:01:54.089 --> 1:01:56.091
So <i>he's</i> in charge?

1:01:57.527 --> 1:01:59.193
Well, not really.

1:01:59.195 --> 1:02:01.828
I mean, he... he's kind of
in charge there, but...

1:02:01.830 --> 1:02:04.198
but, I mean, I carry a lot
of weight, too, you know?

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.967
- But I'm here talking to you.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

1:02:09.238 --> 1:02:11.273
There's no negotiating.

1:02:13.543 --> 1:02:18.981
However...
you may yet prove useful.

1:02:23.852 --> 1:02:25.852
Fred!

1:02:25.854 --> 1:02:28.123
Your friend likes to talk!

1:02:28.824 --> 1:02:32.527
And you?
Will you now talk?

1:02:32.529 --> 1:02:38.100
Send out the girl and the bag,
and I send him back!

1:02:39.101 --> 1:02:40.501
Fred, what's up?

1:02:40.503 --> 1:02:42.102
Give me the bag.

1:02:42.104 --> 1:02:45.005
This is the last time
I talk to you!

1:02:45.007 --> 1:02:46.541
Last time!

1:02:46.543 --> 1:02:48.809
They're gonna kill both of you.

1:02:48.811 --> 1:02:50.210
Fred, they're gonna
kill you both!

1:02:54.417 --> 1:02:56.218
Your call, Fred!

1:03:01.524 --> 1:03:03.426
This what you want?!

1:03:04.394 --> 1:03:06.093
You let him go!

1:03:06.095 --> 1:03:07.327
Shit, Lou.
Come on.

1:03:07.329 --> 1:03:12.369
If you want this,
you let my friend go!

1:03:14.870 --> 1:03:16.305
Fuck.

1:03:17.072 --> 1:03:19.072
Fuck it.

1:03:19.074 --> 1:03:20.309
Kill him.

1:03:32.221 --> 1:03:34.391
Fred, on your left!

1:03:42.465 --> 1:03:43.498
Lou!

1:03:53.309 --> 1:03:55.175
Lou!

1:03:55.177 --> 1:03:56.943
Lou!
Aah! Aah!

1:03:56.945 --> 1:03:57.944
Fred!

1:03:57.946 --> 1:03:59.179
Go!

1:03:59.181 --> 1:04:00.883
- Oh, shit!
- Fred, come on.

1:04:04.987 --> 1:04:06.219
Give me that leg.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1:04:06.221 --> 1:04:08.021
All right.
Come on.

1:04:08.023 --> 1:04:10.324
Come on.

1:04:10.326 --> 1:04:12.092
- All right. Oh, shit.
- Come on. Set him down.

1:04:12.094 --> 1:04:13.561
- Set him down.
- All right. Let me go.

1:04:13.563 --> 1:04:15.396
There you go.

1:04:15.398 --> 1:04:19.333
Can we get a...
Can we get a...

1:04:21.036 --> 1:04:23.003
There you go.
There you go.

1:04:23.005 --> 1:04:24.938
Hey, give me that.

1:04:24.940 --> 1:04:26.973
Here. Make that.
Okay?

1:04:29.379 --> 1:04:30.578
- There we go.
- Ow!

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:33.113
- Shit.
- It's all right.

1:04:33.115 --> 1:04:34.482
Hey!

1:04:36.453 --> 1:04:38.985
Fucking Lou.

1:04:54.437 --> 1:04:55.337
Doug?

1:04:56.939 --> 1:04:58.439
Doug, talk to me, man.

1:04:58.441 --> 1:05:00.410
Oh, shit.

1:05:03.446 --> 1:05:05.147
He's dead.

1:05:11.688 --> 1:05:14.156
Call in the 92 Mikes.

1:05:18.327 --> 1:05:19.895
Watch yourself. Watch yourself.

1:05:30.205 --> 1:05:32.172
I'll tell you what.

1:05:32.174 --> 1:05:36.679
If I'm gonna, uh,
go into the abyss...

1:05:38.013 --> 1:05:40.383
...just as soon go out
on a buzz.

1:05:47.424 --> 1:05:50.058
I'll see you down the road,
brother.

1:05:56.265 --> 1:05:58.133
Fuckin' Lou.

1:05:59.334 --> 1:06:01.602
Fuckin' moron.

1:06:01.604 --> 1:06:04.271
What the fuck was that about?

1:06:06.609 --> 1:06:08.043
It's done, man.

1:06:15.083 --> 1:06:17.085
Ain't over till it's over.

1:06:18.220 --> 1:06:20.688
Ain't over till it's over.

1:06:20.690 --> 1:06:22.423
Shit!

1:06:22.425 --> 1:06:23.359
Fuck.

1:06:31.801 --> 1:06:33.568
- Hey.
- This is bullshit.

1:06:33.570 --> 1:06:35.369
You're bullshit.

1:06:35.371 --> 1:06:37.672
I want to live.
We all want to fuckin' life.

1:06:37.674 --> 1:06:39.373
We need you together, not drunk.

1:06:39.375 --> 1:06:42.612
This is about as together
as I'm gonna get, all right?

1:06:44.614 --> 1:06:46.447
Don't give up now.

1:06:46.449 --> 1:06:48.248
- Look.
- Come on.

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:51.452
I'm sorry.
I... I don't know what to do.

1:06:51.454 --> 1:06:53.021
We're done.

1:06:54.424 --> 1:06:56.457
You had ways out.

1:06:56.459 --> 1:06:58.359
You did.

1:06:58.361 --> 1:07:00.293
But you chose to fight.

1:07:00.295 --> 1:07:02.095
You asked for this fight.

1:07:02.097 --> 1:07:03.831
And your friends,
they followed you

1:07:03.833 --> 1:07:05.668
because they believed in you.

1:07:07.135 --> 1:07:08.471
But now...

1:07:09.639 --> 1:07:11.472
Now you're just a pussy.

1:07:11.474 --> 1:07:13.574
Some mouth you got on you.

1:07:13.576 --> 1:07:14.575
You know that?

1:07:14.577 --> 1:07:17.312
Did you get that
from your dead sister, too? Huh?

1:07:19.682 --> 1:07:21.314
You want to drink yourself
to death?

1:07:21.316 --> 1:07:23.018
Go right a-fuckin'-head.

1:07:56.853 --> 1:07:58.086
All right.

1:07:58.588 --> 1:08:00.790
Fire it up.

1:08:07.397 --> 1:08:08.297
We move without him.

1:08:09.599 --> 1:08:10.898
I don't like it any more
than you do,

1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:12.198
but getting home
is the priority.

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:15.536
"We"?
Who put you in charge?

1:08:15.538 --> 1:08:18.472
If you don't have a better idea,
Walter, shut the fuck up.

1:08:18.474 --> 1:08:21.442
Hey, assholes,
you're not helping anything.

1:08:21.444 --> 1:08:23.511
Well, have you got an idea?

1:08:23.513 --> 1:08:25.813
'Cause we could sure as hell use
a light-bulb moment

1:08:25.815 --> 1:08:27.247
right about now, lady.

1:08:35.692 --> 1:08:37.491
It's for you that we're doing
all of this.

1:08:37.493 --> 1:08:39.326
Hey, I never asked
for your goddamn help, Gramps.

1:08:39.328 --> 1:08:40.728
You didn't have to!

1:08:40.730 --> 1:08:42.430
That's the point!

1:08:42.432 --> 1:08:44.230
The second you walked through
that door,

1:08:44.232 --> 1:08:46.400
we were duty-bound to help you!

1:08:46.402 --> 1:08:47.568
Of course, you'd never get that

1:08:47.570 --> 1:08:49.637
through your thick
fuckin' skull.

1:08:49.639 --> 1:08:51.939
I'm supposed to be
at the titty bar right now.

1:08:51.941 --> 1:08:55.409
You know, great big silicone
melons right in my fuckin' face!

1:08:55.411 --> 1:08:57.445
Yeah. Sorry to ruin
your big fuckin' evening.

1:08:57.447 --> 1:08:59.279
Well, sorry don't feed
the bulldog, boy.

1:08:59.281 --> 1:09:01.247
Hey, ladies, I hate to interrupt

1:09:01.249 --> 1:09:02.516
your party-planning session
right now,

1:09:02.518 --> 1:09:04.317
but we got more urgent matters
to tend to.

1:09:04.319 --> 1:09:07.320
Damn it! All the shit
I've been through in my life!

1:09:07.322 --> 1:09:09.457
I'm gonna be put tits up
by a bunch of goddamn junkies!

1:09:09.459 --> 1:09:10.658
Fuckin' chill out...

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:13.529
Oh, shut up, all of you!

1:09:30.513 --> 1:09:31.814
Let's go.

1:09:36.386 --> 1:09:38.186
Why not?

1:09:55.303 --> 1:09:58.708
Oh, is that you, Mr. Fred?

1:10:00.476 --> 1:10:02.510
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

1:10:02.512 --> 1:10:06.312
I know hindsight's 20/20,
but...

1:10:07.383 --> 1:10:09.752
...you should have dealt
for him.

1:10:10.953 --> 1:10:13.454
You know,
inside that little hole,

1:10:13.456 --> 1:10:16.757
I can see just a small bit
of you.

1:10:16.759 --> 1:10:19.294
But I know what's in there.

1:10:20.363 --> 1:10:26.767
You regretting every single
decision you've made today.

1:10:26.769 --> 1:10:30.305
You've got it all wrong, son.
I don't regret a thing.

1:10:31.941 --> 1:10:33.641
I lost my friends.

1:10:33.643 --> 1:10:35.310
Well, that's not right.

1:10:36.311 --> 1:10:37.411
You took my friends.

1:10:37.413 --> 1:10:41.617
But I guess they knew
what they signed up for now.

1:10:42.719 --> 1:10:45.419
I don't regret a goddamn thing.

1:10:45.421 --> 1:10:48.656
Matter of fact...

1:10:48.658 --> 1:10:51.759
right about now,
I'm feeling real eager.

1:10:51.761 --> 1:10:54.395
So whatever you're gonna do,

1:10:54.397 --> 1:10:57.297
quit flapping your gums
and do it.

1:10:57.299 --> 1:11:01.969
But when you come, boy,
you come sharp,

1:11:01.971 --> 1:11:04.339
'cause you make a mistake...

1:11:07.844 --> 1:11:10.245
...I'm gonna cut your heart out.

1:11:17.420 --> 1:11:19.086
- Fred, that lamp propane.
- Yeah.

1:11:19.088 --> 1:11:19.954
It's gonna blow.

1:11:19.956 --> 1:11:21.822
We'd better hunker down.
Don't you think?

1:11:21.824 --> 1:11:23.960
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Dead Eye.

1:11:24.961 --> 1:11:25.995
You know how to waltz?

1:11:26.729 --> 1:11:28.696
Waltz?

1:11:28.698 --> 1:11:31.567
'Cause I'm gonna need you
to follow my lead.

1:11:33.536 --> 1:11:35.603
He's back.

1:11:46.482 --> 1:11:48.482
This ain't gonna be enough.

1:11:48.484 --> 1:11:52.086
A victory is not a victory
if everybody dies.

1:11:52.088 --> 1:11:53.356
Not in my mind.

1:11:54.690 --> 1:11:57.827
It's been a real honor serving
with you men.

1:11:59.061 --> 1:12:00.963
A real honor.

1:12:03.666 --> 1:12:04.799
Hey!

1:12:04.801 --> 1:12:05.666
- Jesus!
- Hey!

1:12:05.668 --> 1:12:07.904
Holy Christ.

1:12:09.138 --> 1:12:10.471
Come on.

1:12:10.473 --> 1:12:13.374
Hunker down. Come on.
Come on.

1:12:13.376 --> 1:12:16.377
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, old man.
Look at me. Look at me.

1:12:16.379 --> 1:12:17.711
Hey.

1:12:25.788 --> 1:12:27.757
Move it, Fred.

1:12:29.125 --> 1:12:31.627
I'm taking point this time.
Move it!

1:12:39.802 --> 1:12:42.405
Come on, Fred.
Come on.

1:12:46.843 --> 1:12:50.546
Let's see what all this rumblin'
is about.

1:12:52.915 --> 1:12:55.451
Come on, ladies!

1:12:57.453 --> 1:12:59.522
I got something for you.

1:14:14.797 --> 1:14:16.964
Hello, friend.

1:14:16.966 --> 1:14:20.968
Perhaps now we can finally
be civil.

1:14:20.970 --> 1:14:25.105
You killed three of my friends.
That's not civil.

1:14:25.107 --> 1:14:27.675
Oh. Well, that was just
a misunderstanding.

1:14:27.677 --> 1:14:32.581
You're all... or <i>were...</i>
soldiers, right?

1:14:33.115 --> 1:14:35.983
This whole place was built
on murder.

1:14:35.985 --> 1:14:37.851
No.

1:14:37.853 --> 1:14:41.188
Well, I suppose murder
<i>is</i> subjective.

1:14:41.190 --> 1:14:43.123
Not really.

1:14:43.125 --> 1:14:48.228
You enjoy it, don't you...
the killing?

1:14:48.230 --> 1:14:52.032
Well, I got to admit...

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:56.472
I did get kind of a charge
out of...

1:14:58.074 --> 1:15:00.076
...blowing your brother's
fucking head off.

1:15:07.216 --> 1:15:10.920
Give me the bag now...

1:15:11.954 --> 1:15:16.957
...and I promise you all...
a quick death.

1:15:16.959 --> 1:15:19.560
Or we'll just take it from you,

1:15:19.562 --> 1:15:21.662
and you'll all die
very, very slowly.

1:15:21.664 --> 1:15:26.202
You last so you can watch
Lizard die.

1:15:49.325 --> 1:15:51.027
Okay.

1:15:52.061 --> 1:15:53.162
You win.

1:16:24.927 --> 1:16:27.129
Get off me, you fuckin' animals!

1:16:56.826 --> 1:16:58.992
Hey!

1:16:58.994 --> 1:17:00.994
- Come on!
- Get out, Fred.

1:17:00.996 --> 1:17:03.030
I can handle these assholes.

1:17:03.032 --> 1:17:04.932
Nobody's gonna take this ridge!

1:17:04.934 --> 1:17:06.367
- Look what I found.
- Jesus Christ.

1:17:06.369 --> 1:17:07.535
Abe!

1:17:07.537 --> 1:17:10.371
They're gonna feel the might
of the American military!

1:17:12.274 --> 1:17:13.273
All right.

1:17:15.878 --> 1:17:18.446
Hey! Look out, kid!
I got this!

1:17:18.448 --> 1:17:20.080
Yeah!

1:17:40.703 --> 1:17:43.639
So you're the bitch
that killed Z, right?

1:17:44.173 --> 1:17:46.041
Oh, that's real scary shit.

1:17:52.248 --> 1:17:54.248
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to steal?!

1:17:54.250 --> 1:17:55.416
Ow!
Fuck you!

1:18:03.159 --> 1:18:05.225
Come on.

1:18:05.227 --> 1:18:06.293
- Come on.
- I'm good.

1:18:06.295 --> 1:18:07.364
I'm good. I'm good!
Go on!

1:18:10.099 --> 1:18:11.499
Fred, come on!

1:18:11.501 --> 1:18:13.767
- Hey, where's the girl?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

1:18:13.769 --> 1:18:15.169
God damn it.
She was here.

1:18:15.171 --> 1:18:16.504
No!
You can't go back for her!

1:18:16.506 --> 1:18:18.473
You look out for Walter.

1:18:18.475 --> 1:18:20.007
- You empty?
- Yeah.

1:18:20.009 --> 1:18:22.109
Okay. Take that.
I'm sick of the damn thing.

1:18:22.111 --> 1:18:23.844
- All right!
- I'll catch up. I'll catch up.

1:18:23.846 --> 1:18:25.881
Shit.

1:18:38.327 --> 1:18:40.060
They slashed his tires.

1:18:40.062 --> 1:18:41.462
Oh, shit.

1:18:41.464 --> 1:18:44.333
The deuce-and-a-half.
Now.

1:18:45.034 --> 1:18:47.470
- Will it run?
- It will if I tell it to.

1:18:48.170 --> 1:18:51.140
No!
Let me go!

1:18:51.874 --> 1:18:53.907
Oh, shit.

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:30.079
Are you ready to die...
old man?

1:19:57.339 --> 1:20:00.274
Good shit.
Thanks. Thanks. Yeah.

1:20:00.276 --> 1:20:02.109
I had the bitch, though.

1:20:02.111 --> 1:20:04.911
Come on.

1:20:10.487 --> 1:20:11.486
Hey, Walter?

1:20:11.488 --> 1:20:13.086
- Huh?
- This thing got any ammo?

1:20:13.088 --> 1:20:15.590
The .50-cal?
No.

1:20:21.498 --> 1:20:24.197
- Walter, hurry up!
- Come on.

1:20:24.199 --> 1:20:25.433
What's taking so long?

1:20:25.435 --> 1:20:27.468
Goddamn impatient millennials!

1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:32.607
You know something, Fred?

1:20:32.609 --> 1:20:34.609
What's that?

1:20:34.611 --> 1:20:36.544
I like this place.

1:20:38.515 --> 1:20:40.417
I'm glad to hear that.

1:20:43.553 --> 1:20:45.420
Turn around.

1:20:45.422 --> 1:20:47.122
Give me that.

1:20:49.426 --> 1:20:52.025
Fred!

1:20:52.027 --> 1:20:53.363
Shit.

1:20:57.567 --> 1:20:59.434
I'll be back.

1:21:01.337 --> 1:21:03.970
Walter!
Hurry the fuck up!

1:21:03.972 --> 1:21:07.109
Did you ever try to pee with
somebody watching you like that?

1:21:12.549 --> 1:21:14.247
Come on, baby.

1:21:14.249 --> 1:21:16.316
Aah!

1:21:18.921 --> 1:21:19.589
Shawn!

1:21:27.430 --> 1:21:28.596
Shawn!

1:21:28.598 --> 1:21:30.330
Fuck!

1:21:30.332 --> 1:21:31.599
Shawn!

1:21:31.601 --> 1:21:33.033
Shawn!

1:21:33.035 --> 1:21:35.304
Aah!

1:21:39.476 --> 1:21:43.145
Aah! Aah!

1:21:56.593 --> 1:21:58.225
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Oh, shit.

1:21:58.227 --> 1:22:00.160
- Oh...
- Hey, you with me?

1:22:00.162 --> 1:22:03.398
Yeah. I've had better days.

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:05.298
Oh, fuck.

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:07.000
That looks like it's gonna
do it, doesn't it?

1:22:07.002 --> 1:22:09.604
No, sir. No, sir. Move over.
I'm getting us out of here.

1:22:09.606 --> 1:22:11.472
Not on your life.

1:22:11.474 --> 1:22:14.076
Where's Fred?

1:22:15.978 --> 1:22:19.179
Oh.
Look at that son of a bitch.

1:22:19.181 --> 1:22:21.014
He's slower than quail shit.

1:22:21.016 --> 1:22:23.751
No! Fuck you!

1:22:26.356 --> 1:22:28.658
Shoot.

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:40.701
Shoot.

1:22:40.703 --> 1:22:43.336
Take peace in this, kid...

1:22:43.338 --> 1:22:46.308
You and your sister
were only separated by...

1:22:50.413 --> 1:22:52.647
I ain't gonna make it, kid.

1:22:52.649 --> 1:22:55.115
I know that.

1:22:55.117 --> 1:22:57.050
This is the end of the line.

1:22:57.052 --> 1:23:01.089
You're a good kid,
and you're a good soldier.

1:23:02.492 --> 1:23:06.161
Now, you go home and take care
of that wife of yours.

1:23:06.763 --> 1:23:08.230
That's an order.

1:23:09.399 --> 1:23:11.164
I got this.

1:23:20.376 --> 1:23:22.110
We're not done.

1:23:22.779 --> 1:23:26.683
No.
No, I suppose we're not.

1:23:30.085 --> 1:23:31.521
Well, Mr. Fred...

1:23:33.288 --> 1:23:37.125
...I believe we have
ourselves... a situation.

1:23:45.300 --> 1:23:48.436
Come on, baby. Come on!

1:23:48.438 --> 1:23:50.438
Yes!

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:52.074
Yes!

1:23:52.609 --> 1:23:54.675
Hey, Fred!

1:23:54.677 --> 1:23:59.214
This is the last goddamn time
I'm gonna bail your ass out!

1:23:59.716 --> 1:24:01.849
Hyah!

1:24:56.472 --> 1:24:58.506
You in one piece?

1:24:58.508 --> 1:25:00.577
Yeah, just about.

1:25:04.681 --> 1:25:07.082
You two all right?

1:25:09.385 --> 1:25:10.885
Walter?

1:25:10.887 --> 1:25:13.621
One of those punks got him
real good.

1:25:13.623 --> 1:25:15.458
He wasn't gonna make it.

1:25:16.759 --> 1:25:19.360
God damn, Walter.

1:25:19.362 --> 1:25:21.364
You old fool.

1:25:22.799 --> 1:25:24.400
Hey, Fred?

1:25:29.237 --> 1:25:34.775
Ranger, I think it's about time
we had one beer for the road.

1:25:34.777 --> 1:25:36.846
You're a real bastard.
You know that?

1:25:47.289 --> 1:25:48.556
You got it?

1:25:48.558 --> 1:25:50.256
Yeah, I got it.

1:25:52.829 --> 1:25:54.196
Abe!

1:25:55.431 --> 1:25:56.764
Hey.

1:25:59.836 --> 1:26:01.638
Hey, Abe.

1:26:20.723 --> 1:26:24.425
Well, at least he died
doing something he liked to do.

1:26:24.427 --> 1:26:26.827
Who the fuck said I was dead?

1:26:26.829 --> 1:26:27.928
- Fuck!
- Jesus.

1:26:27.930 --> 1:26:29.666
Don't do that.

1:26:43.813 --> 1:26:45.513
Doug.

1:26:45.515 --> 1:26:46.949
Z.

1:26:47.850 --> 1:26:48.918
Lou.

1:26:51.253 --> 1:26:52.553
Walter.

1:26:52.555 --> 1:26:54.189
And Lucy.

1:26:59.896 --> 1:27:01.497
And Abe.

1:27:16.646 --> 1:27:19.214
Well, shit.

1:27:20.016 --> 1:27:21.882
What do you figure
this is worth?

1:27:21.884 --> 1:27:24.018
A whole lot.

1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:26.856
Enough to fix the place up
and more.

1:27:33.328 --> 1:27:35.898
Happy birthday, old man.
