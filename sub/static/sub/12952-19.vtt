WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.067
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.068 --> 00:05.504
The box has not been opened
since the time of Rambaldi.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.806
It was rumored to contain
the strain

00:07.807 --> 00:10.742
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.845
This bioweapon.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.313
What do you know about it?

00:14.314 --> 00:18.842
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.253
The CIA wants me
executed next week

00:21.254 --> 00:22.788
because they believe
that I was working

00:22.789 --> 00:25.057
with Senator Reed, and I was.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.759
But my association
with Senator Reed

00:26.760 --> 00:29.923
had nothing to do with advancing
The Covenant's agenda.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.564
Two years ago,
Senator Reed recruited me

00:32.564 --> 00:35.466
to work for an organization
inside the U.S. Government.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.368
They refer to themselves
as The Trust.

00:38.438 --> 00:42.272
I need you to prove
that this group exists.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.243
I was serving my country, Jack.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.479
Not betraying it.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.280
In one of his sessions
with Barnett,

00:51.351 --> 00:53.719
Sloane admitted having
an affair with Irina

00:53.720 --> 00:56.220
while you were married.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.524
What are you saying,
Lauren is Covenant?

00:58.525 --> 00:59.992
I can't be sure.

00:59.993 --> 01:03.053
The shooter was wearing a wig.
It was dark.

01:10.937 --> 01:12.371
We were wrong
about The Passenger.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.972
It's not a weapon.
It's a person.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.703
I think The Passenger
may be your mother.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.293 --> 02:42.921
I am looking for The Passenger.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.832
I have a great respect
for the followers of Rambaldi,

02:51.905 --> 02:54.874
and I know you to be
a truly wise man.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.441
But if you do not tell me
where to find The Passenger

02:57.477 --> 02:58.944
in five seconds,

02:58.945 --> 03:01.445
I will kill you.

03:17.597 --> 03:21.089
I cannot help you, Mr. Sark.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.201
How do you know my name?

03:39.786 --> 03:42.286
Aah!

03:42.989 --> 03:45.324
Retrieve the manuscript
regarding The Passenger,

03:45.325 --> 03:47.492
and I'll meet you in Rajasthan.

03:47.493 --> 03:48.660
Bring him with you.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.960
He may be useful
if the manuscript is encrypted.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.139
But when I mentioned
The Passenger to your mother,

04:01.140 --> 04:03.836
she terminated her user account.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.539
Either she is The Passenger,
or she's protecting her.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.481
What's going on?

04:09.482 --> 04:11.982
Your message said
it was important.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.518
You were right.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.988
About what?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.154
Lauren's the mole.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.391
She works for The Covenant.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.892
You have proof?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.664
I should have known.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.600
We should talk to Dixon and
figure out a way to handle this.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.068
Oh, I know how to handle this.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.503
You will act like nothing
has changed.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.839
Okay, what's plan B?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.407
Given that The Covenant
is ahead of us

04:35.408 --> 04:37.276
in the search for The Passenger,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.711
tracking Lauren
might allow us to catch up.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.880
She cannot detect
the slightest alteration

04:41.881 --> 04:43.715
in your relationship.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.851
I'll inform Dixon,
we'll secure the agency,

04:45.852 --> 04:48.086
limiting her access
to classified documents.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.612
Stop. My wife betrayed me.
She betrayed all of us.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.091
You can't expect me to
pretend that never happened.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.060
- I'm not sure you have a choice.
- Why is that?

04:55.061 --> 04:57.689
Because you're the one
that married her.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.574
I missed you this morning.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.883
I got up early
and went to the gym.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.255
- I should have let you know.
- Oh, it's fine.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.457
In fact, I like it.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.552
Makes me feel like we've
settled back into our lives.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.620
Yeah.
I think we have.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.967
Before my dad died,

05:35.968 --> 05:39.199
I asked you if you would come
with me to counseling,

05:39.272 --> 05:41.772
and you said no.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.608
I still think it could help.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.877
It's just a thought.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.378
No, I'd like that.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.583
After 30 years, you still
live with your wife's betrayal.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.958
Will he?

06:02.261 --> 06:04.761
Absolutely.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.765
An Echelon intercept
we just received

06:06.766 --> 06:08.767
indicates The Covenant
has kidnapped someone

06:08.768 --> 06:11.203
they believe can help them
find The Passenger.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.866
A convoy is transporting him
across Western Rajasthan.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.968
You and Vaughn will intercept it
and take him into custody.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.144
We don't have the Indian
government's cooperation,

06:19.145 --> 06:23.104
and the air space is restricted,
so you're going in old school.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.998
We've done well here.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.434
Quite well.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.920
Thank you.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.691
We have to go.
Follow me!

07:49.101 --> 07:50.435
Give me your gun.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.936
Give me the gun now!

08:01.080 --> 08:03.580
Here!

08:17.063 --> 08:18.129
Press on.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.630
We have everything we need.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.909
They have The Restoration.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.846
The Passenger is compromised.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.419
Just breathe.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.725
It's you.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.428
The Passenger.

08:51.430 --> 08:54.126
She is your destiny.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.668
How is she my destiny?

08:56.669 --> 08:59.229
As a friend?
As an enemy?

08:59.305 --> 09:00.772
Tell me.
Tell me that.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.273
Is The Passenger my mother?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.143
The Passenger...

09:05.144 --> 09:07.644
is...

09:09.549 --> 09:12.049
your sister.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.392
In Nepal, the convoy
was transporting a man.

09:55.394 --> 09:56.895
We tried rescuing him
from The Covenant,

09:56.896 --> 09:58.363
but he was shot.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.733
Before he died, he told me
my mother was not The Passenger.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.937
He said my sister was.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.206
Who was this man?

10:08.207 --> 10:10.175
A monk, a cleric,
a Rambaldi scholar.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.910
Dad, what difference
does it make?

10:11.911 --> 10:13.244
Do I have a sister?

10:13.245 --> 10:15.745
I don't know.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.612
Maybe that's why Mom's name
was linked to The Passenger.

10:20.686 --> 10:24.486
Maybe because she had
another child.

10:25.057 --> 10:28.424
During our marriage,
your mother had an affair.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.628
If, in fact, you do have
a sister, it's conceivable

10:33.199 --> 10:35.724
she is the product
of that indiscretion.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.169
I'd hoped to spare you
the name of the person

10:38.170 --> 10:40.670
with whom the affair took place.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.440
But if he is...

10:45.044 --> 10:46.678
the father of your sister,

10:46.679 --> 10:49.179
that is no longer possible.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.582
Who is it?

11:10.736 --> 11:11.970
Sydney.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.972
Thank God.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.473
You have to help me.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.577
Your execution
cannot come fast enough.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.980
I'm innocent, Sydney.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.950
I have not violated
my pardon agreement.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.919
It was based on my cooperation

11:27.920 --> 11:29.821
with an organization
known as The Trust.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.956
Senator Reed was my contact.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.926
If he was the mole,
I did not know.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.122
Ask your father.
He knows that.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.564
If you were innocent,

11:39.565 --> 11:42.830
he'd find a way
to stay your execution.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.997
Even though you had
an affair with his wife.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.343
You know that.

11:53.679 --> 11:54.979
Huh.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.650
I have 72 hours to live.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.687
I want you to focus on that,

12:02.688 --> 12:05.589
not on some affair I had
25 years ago.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.320
I'm not focusing on the affair.

12:09.028 --> 12:12.794
I'm focusing on the child
that resulted from it.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.462
A sister I never knew I had.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.369
It must have come
as a shock to you.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.677
It did to me when I found out.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.545
Are you telling me
you didn't know?

12:27.546 --> 12:31.073
No.
Not until two years ago.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.985
When I was in a monastery
in Nepal

12:33.986 --> 12:36.580
run by followers of Rambaldi.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.126
Go on.

12:41.127 --> 12:44.324
Sydney, the revelation
that I had a child,

12:44.396 --> 12:46.896
it was overwhelming.

12:48.167 --> 12:52.001
I spent every possible moment
from that day on

12:52.071 --> 12:54.665
searching for my child.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.574
The Di Regno heart.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.243
And II Dire,

12:58.244 --> 13:02.613
Rambaldi's machine that I
so painstakingly constructed.

13:02.681 --> 13:07.641
Together they gave me
an individual's DNA

13:07.720 --> 13:09.287
and the word "peace. "

13:09.288 --> 13:13.122
Which in Greek translates
into Irina.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.655
I did a DNA test.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.664
Confirmed that I was
the father of the child.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.627
So, Sydney, I created Omnifam.

13:23.702 --> 13:26.137
And while I was inoculating
millions of people

13:26.138 --> 13:27.572
against diseases,

13:27.573 --> 13:31.009
I was simultaneously
able to gain access

13:31.076 --> 13:33.244
to medical databases

13:33.245 --> 13:36.339
that identified people
through their DNA.

13:37.817 --> 13:43.517
And I hoped that it would
help me find my daughter.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.524
I failed.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.295
You know she is The Passenger.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.796
I know.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.733
I know.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.366
I also know
The Covenant is after her.

14:02.241 --> 14:06.507
Sydney, I want to protect...

14:07.813 --> 14:10.313
...my child.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.651
So please talk to your father.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.524
If he is concealing information
that would exonerate me

14:24.597 --> 14:27.097
because I had an affair
with Irina,

14:27.166 --> 14:29.794
convince him to give it to you.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.404
If not for my sake...

14:36.108 --> 14:38.608
...then for your sister's.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.478
Okay, here's what we found out
from Project: Black Hole.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.653
"The Restoration"
refers to documents written

14:48.654 --> 14:49.654
about The Passenger.

14:49.655 --> 14:50.588
That's the bad news.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.717
The good news is
The Covenant can't read them.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.526
- They're in code.
- Yes.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.896
- And we have the only code key.
- It's a stalemate.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.422
Not if we're smart about it.
Here's what we do.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.434
We call a briefing,
making sure to include Lauren.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.437
Once she's there, you detail
the following information.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.740
Analysis is currently
filtering through some chatter

15:08.741 --> 15:10.508
they picked up
referencing The Restoration.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.377
They're certain that it will
only be a matter of hours

15:12.378 --> 15:15.575
before they can locate
these documents.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.349
After indicating
confidence in our ability

15:18.350 --> 15:20.218
to locate and recapture
The Restoration,

15:20.219 --> 15:22.687
we then explain
what we will do once we have it.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.589
Project: Black Hole is
delivering the code key today.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.388
The minute we come into
possession of The Restoration,

15:28.460 --> 15:31.361
Marshall will begin
the decoding process.

15:32.364 --> 15:35.026
In truth, Marshall will be
receiving a bogus code key.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.535
We should also
remind Lauren that...

15:37.536 --> 15:39.470
Even if we do not
recover the documents,

15:39.471 --> 15:40.805
we know that
without this code key,

15:40.806 --> 15:42.807
The Covenant will not
be able to read it.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.442
After learning
a code key exists,

15:44.443 --> 15:46.811
it is probable
Lauren will try and copy it.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.312
That's where you come in.

15:51.383 --> 15:52.016
Me?

15:52.017 --> 15:55.145
You have to act
completely normal.

15:58.223 --> 15:59.691
Marshall.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.027
Lauren.
Agent Vaughn-Reed.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.528
Mrs. Vaughn-Reed.
Hi.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.465
What can I do for you?

16:07.466 --> 16:09.434
Project: Black Hole
does not share its toys

16:09.435 --> 16:11.302
as often as the NSC would like.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.304
Governmental turf war,
that kind of thing.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.772
When I told them
about the code key,

16:14.773 --> 16:16.641
they insisted
I detail it for them.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.609
Right.
Well, go ahead, have a look.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.110
And while you're at it,
have a gander.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not on the Flinkman file.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.284
Just a little journal
I'm keeping for Mitch.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.286
Patent ideas, history
of quantum mechanics,

16:28.287 --> 16:31.154
brief intro to string theory,
you know, basics.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.159
The letters here,
what language is that?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.861
It's 4th-century
Neapolitan Italian.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.296
Which I love saying,

16:38.297 --> 16:40.797
because it makes me
think of ice cream.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.661
Neapolitan ice cream
is my favorite.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.939
Really?

16:50.242 --> 16:51.476
Mine too.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.977
She is good.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.412
I mean, if you had
to fall in love

16:54.413 --> 16:56.848
with someone that was evil,
I can see why it was her.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.183
Not that
you're in love with her.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.846
Whatever the attraction
was originally...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.321
Did she take the bait?

17:03.322 --> 17:05.289
I'm not sure,
but she did take my thumbprint.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.790
- May I?
- What are you doing?

17:08.327 --> 17:11.558
I am checking to see
if there's any use

17:11.630 --> 17:14.565
of my biometric access
within the agency.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.516
She's in Image Processing.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.017
She must be duplicating
the code key.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.385
Okay, I've left
Image Processing.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.386
I haven't left,

18:08.387 --> 18:09.921
because I'm here,
and she's there.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.589
The next step will be
to bring the code key

18:11.590 --> 18:13.558
to her handler
or whoever can use it

18:13.559 --> 18:15.760
to read the documents
written about The Passenger.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.821
All right, you will track her
and identify her contact.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.998
That should lead us to
the location of the documents.

18:20.999 --> 18:24.025
At that time, we'll spec out
a mission to recover them.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.996
Jack has told us
The Passenger is your sister.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.576
Hopefully what is written
on these documents

18:31.577 --> 18:34.077
will give us
what we need to find her.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.984
Sloane confirmed
the child is his.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.521
I see.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.622
I know how much this upsets you.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.123
I'm fine.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.693
Dad.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.561
If Sloane is gonna be executed,

18:50.562 --> 18:53.062
it should be for a crime
he's committed.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.233
What exactly are you implying?

18:55.234 --> 18:58.032
If you have evidence
exonerating him,

18:58.103 --> 19:00.603
you have to use it.

19:01.573 --> 19:04.371
I don't have any evidence.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.314
You should go.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.960
You know what I want?

19:22.961 --> 19:25.461
What?

19:25.764 --> 19:28.264
A normal life.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.643
Here we go.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.683
Lauren's mother?

19:45.684 --> 19:48.448
Olivia? She's supposed to be
in London.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.430
Looks like she just
passed her something.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.634
Can you hear anything?

20:03.635 --> 20:05.870
No, we're getting interference
from that fountain.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.338
The Covenant needs you

20:07.339 --> 20:08.806
to ensure that things
will be taken care of.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.107
Oh, my God.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.109
Hang on.
I'm gonna filter it

20:12.110 --> 20:14.610
through the active
noise reduction.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.542
You could at least pretend
to mourn.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.384
I killed your father
to protect you.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.886
The sound waves are isolated.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.221
I'm gonna invert them,
and that should...

20:23.222 --> 20:26.282
- Where are the documents?
- At home in Richmond.

20:26.358 --> 20:29.794
The Covenant wants the complete
translations by tomorrow.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.662
I'll meet you there.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.164
Whatever they tell us
about The Passenger

20:33.165 --> 20:35.665
we should act on immediately.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.148
Lauren doesn't trust me.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.783
Should she trust you?

20:52.784 --> 20:55.253
Trust is based on honesty,
and when I've had problems,

20:55.254 --> 20:56.387
I've talked to her about them.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.322
What I don't trust,
what worries me,

20:58.323 --> 20:59.790
is that I feel
that Michael will leave me

20:59.791 --> 21:01.692
once I've mourned
the death of my father.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.728
If that was true,
why would I be doing this?

21:03.729 --> 21:05.029
If it was all fake?

21:05.030 --> 21:06.764
I didn't say it was fake.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.033
Temporary. Whatever.
If that's what it was,

21:09.034 --> 21:12.026
why would I agree
to work on our problems?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.434
Our problem is you think
you're in love with Sydney.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.476
How am I supposed
to respond to that?

21:18.477 --> 21:20.977
Honestly would be good.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.682
Sydney is very important to me.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.183
We have history, obviously.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.021
We're together a lot.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.423
We go away together a lot.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.484
Did the two of you ever go away?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.528
Never.

21:37.529 --> 21:40.029
Well, maybe you should.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.566
Do you have any trips planned?

21:42.567 --> 21:44.802
Lauren's going to see
her mother in Richmond.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.804
Only for a day.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.305
It's a start.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.244
It worked.
He's going.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.019
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.012
I'm so glad you made it.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.058
You two young people

22:07.059 --> 22:09.687
are just what this drafty,
old house needs.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.962
Thanks, Olivia.
It's nice to be here.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.197
I'll run these upstairs.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.698
Thanks.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.771
His being here is unacceptable.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.240
I told you, I had no choice.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.741
We're supposed to be
reconciling.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.999
You getting a reading?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.435
Tapping into the power grid now.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.564
Now, the E.M. Sensor I designed
should lead us right to it.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.640
We'll let you know
as soon as we find the safe.

22:56.641 --> 22:59.141
Copy that.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.547
I was just telling Mum
how great you've been

23:03.548 --> 23:04.548
the past few weeks.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.050
Oh.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.551
Lauren's been incredibly strong.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.622
How are you?

23:11.623 --> 23:14.421
I'm doing surprisingly well
for a pariah.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.861
I never liked politics.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.387
You never know
who your friends are.

23:19.464 --> 23:22.592
At least now that
I'm the wife of a traitor,

23:22.667 --> 23:24.468
I know the answer.

23:24.469 --> 23:25.569
I had none.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.639
Excuse me.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.643
Hello?

23:32.644 --> 23:33.911
The safe is in the study.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.713
It's Weiss.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.214
He needs help on a brief.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.087
You're cold.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.089
While I'm inside,
I'll get you a sweater.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.490
Thank you.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.991
What have you got?

23:52.564 --> 23:55.431
Okay, switching back to comms.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.693
- I'm at the safe.
- Standing by for transmission.

24:35.941 --> 24:37.308
Scanning text now.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.809
Copy that, Boy Scout.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.812
Receiving data.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.916
- Have you decoded the documents?
- I haven't had the time.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.579
Most of that was supposed to be
going on while you were here.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.755
You do your work.
I can handle him.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.256
I wonder.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.145
One more page.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.646
Should be another 30 seconds.

25:23.321 --> 25:24.321
Whoops.

25:24.322 --> 25:26.190
What do you mean, "whoops"?

25:26.191 --> 25:28.526
Sensor picked up
a new E.M. Reading.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.528
I think there's
somebody else in the house.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.562
Someone is coming.

25:31.563 --> 25:34.063
I'm almost done.

25:50.115 --> 25:51.615
Sweetheart.

25:51.616 --> 25:54.116
What are you doing in here?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.990
I was looking
at our wedding pictures.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.289
I remembered your parents
kept them here.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.865
Remember that day?

26:11.169 --> 26:13.669
I'll go get your sweater.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.904
That was the happiest day
of my life.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.980
Mine too.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.882
I want to be that happy again.

26:26.651 --> 26:29.211
What can I do
to make that happen?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.031
- That's a start.
- Really?

26:55.513 --> 26:57.514
I'm sure that's not
what it sounds like.

26:57.515 --> 26:58.949
Not that it sounds
like anything,

26:58.950 --> 27:01.510
'cause, you know,
there isn't any sound.

27:01.586 --> 27:03.153
There's probably really not...

27:03.154 --> 27:04.488
Turn it off.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.323
Sorry.

27:06.324 --> 27:10.192
Bad idea to keep it on
in the first place.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.066
Using the real code key,
Marshall was able

27:16.067 --> 27:18.369
to decipher the documents
Vaughn retrieved from Mrs. Reed.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.737
They detail a Rambaldi artifact
known as The Hourglass.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.741
It turns out The Hourglass was
only recently sold at auction

27:24.976 --> 27:26.677
to a man named Masa Raidon.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.146
<i>The guy running yakuza's
U.S. Shipping business?</i>

27:29.147 --> 27:32.241
Yes. Now, Raidon owns
a building in little Tokyo.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.684
<i>A yakuza stronghold.</i>

27:33.685 --> 27:35.152
He's got a nightclub
on the ground floor.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.421
You might want to stop by,
have a little...

27:37.422 --> 27:40.255
And there's a personal
art gallery on sublevel 2.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.351
That's where he's holding
The Hourglass.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.962
But you're gonna
have to move quickly.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.030
Why is that?

27:46.031 --> 27:47.731
Well, according
to Rambaldi's manuscript,

27:47.732 --> 27:50.599
The Hourglass will only reveal
the location of The Passenger

27:50.669 --> 27:52.169
to one man.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.670
Her father.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.739
Sloane.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.941
And he's gonna be dead
in six hours.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.243
This is impossible.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.445
Justice has been apprised
of Sloane's value.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.480
They refused
to stay the execution.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.981
If Sloane dies,
any chance I have

28:06.017 --> 28:07.818
of finding my sister
dies with him.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.953
Has it occurred to you
that your half-sister

28:09.954 --> 28:11.789
might be a danger to you?

28:11.790 --> 28:14.124
Yes, of course.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.360
But it's equally possible
that I can help her.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.495
She could be an innocent victim.

28:18.496 --> 28:21.465
With Irina Derevko and
Arvin Sloane as her parents?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.033
I don't think so.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.963
I requested to look at
Senator Reed's personal effects.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.701
Every notebook, memo, receipt.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.369
I know The Trust exists.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.714
Dad, are you really so bitter

28:36.715 --> 28:39.650
that you would
sacrifice my sister

28:39.718 --> 28:43.654
in order to get payback
for a 25-year-old affair?

28:45.590 --> 28:47.691
Sloane deserves to die.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.192
Yes, he does.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.495
But not for this.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.836
The director of legal policy
at Justice

28:58.837 --> 29:01.431
has operational control
over Sloane's case.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.006
He's coming to oversee
the execution.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.477
I'll turn over the information
I have on The Trust

29:06.478 --> 29:08.345
as soon as he arrives.

29:08.346 --> 29:11.338
That should exonerate Sloane.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.587
Thank you.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.989
Sydney.

29:18.990 --> 29:23.086
What exactly did you find
in the senator's effects?

29:23.161 --> 29:24.762
Nothing.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.960
I requested them,
but they haven't arrived.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.161
Now I don't have to look.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.013
Looks like the west stairwell

29:43.014 --> 29:45.082
is your most direct access
to the sublevels.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.450
What about countermeasures?

29:46.451 --> 29:47.985
The best we can tell,
it's only the guards,

29:47.986 --> 29:49.787
but we haven't had a chance
to do a thorough scan.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.288
We're sort of working
on the fly.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.396
Syd, about what happened
in Richmond...

30:01.399 --> 30:04.061
You were doing your job.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.905
And she is your wife.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.410
Not for long.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.254
Jack, I want you to meet
Marlon Bell.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.356
He runs legal policy at Justice.

30:26.357 --> 30:27.591
Good to meet you.

30:27.592 --> 30:30.092
I was telling the director
how pleased I am

30:30.094 --> 30:31.395
you caught Sloane.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.126
Since my signature
was on the pardon agreement,

30:34.199 --> 30:36.861
I was embarrassed and relieved,

30:36.935 --> 30:38.869
and if you don't mind
my saying so,

30:38.870 --> 30:42.101
looking forward to seeing
the son of a bitch die.

30:43.141 --> 30:45.641
Excuse us.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.061
You're not gonna help me.

31:11.135 --> 31:14.502
In April '75 in Saigon...

31:15.573 --> 31:17.574
you toasted Sydney's birth

31:17.575 --> 31:20.544
with a bottle of
Chambertin-Clos de Bèze.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.415
Your favorite.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.819
Now that I know
you have a daughter,

31:28.820 --> 31:31.320
I thought I should
return the honor,

31:31.322 --> 31:34.052
especially considering
they share the same mother.

31:34.125 --> 31:37.288
Irina betrayed both of us, Jack.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.363
She sought me out
for information

31:39.364 --> 31:41.164
the same way she did you.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.665
She was my wife.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.097
She was a KGB spy

31:47.171 --> 31:49.969
who cared nothing
about you or me.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.210
I've always thought
that you understood

31:53.211 --> 31:55.839
your relationship with Irina
was nothing more than that,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.382
but now that
your schoolboy crush

31:58.383 --> 32:00.317
on the woman
who destroyed your life

32:00.318 --> 32:03.219
is preventing you
from saving mine...

32:04.155 --> 32:07.488
I will have to revise
that assessment.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.660
Irina Derevko affected your life

32:09.661 --> 32:12.653
every bit as much
as she affected mine.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.399
I knew the possibility existed

32:15.400 --> 32:17.994
that Sydney would be
drawn into our world,

32:18.069 --> 32:20.170
but I often wondered

32:20.171 --> 32:22.005
why you were the one
who sought her out,

32:22.006 --> 32:24.736
why you showed such
paternal affection toward her.

32:24.809 --> 32:26.877
Now I know.

32:26.878 --> 32:30.041
You did it because
you were angry and jealous

32:30.114 --> 32:31.715
and wanted
to take away the one thing

32:31.716 --> 32:33.684
that was important
to both Irina and me.

32:33.685 --> 32:38.622
The symbol of what we had
and you didn't.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.190
Sydney.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.227
You're right.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.728
I'm not going to help you.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.000
Since this is
the last conversation

32:50.001 --> 32:52.834
we will ever have,

32:52.904 --> 32:55.464
I want to make this
perfectly clear.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.507
What you have done
to my daughter

33:00.578 --> 33:04.139
is nothing compared
to what I will do

33:04.215 --> 33:06.715
when I find yours.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.720
<i>Salud.</i>

33:32.710 --> 33:35.210
Half an hour.

33:47.658 --> 33:48.658
I'm on the list.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.094
Everyone's on the list.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.096
My friends are waiting
for me inside.

33:53.097 --> 33:55.793
Wait your turn.
Till then, stop talking to me.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.635
- Back in line.
- Hey, lay off the suit, man.

33:58.636 --> 33:59.870
Why don't you find
your way home?

33:59.871 --> 34:02.105
Oh, you're a big tough guy now?
Living the dream?

34:02.106 --> 34:04.606
You want to see
what I'm dreaming?

34:05.276 --> 34:07.776
All right, take it easy.
You win.

34:26.664 --> 34:29.164
I pray for you.

34:30.234 --> 34:33.601
I pray your soul can find
peace in the next life.

34:33.670 --> 34:36.170
That's very kind, Marcus.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.643
Let's go.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.500
I'm heading down.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.739
Copy that, Mountaineer.
You're all clear.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.848
Marshall, work your magic.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.977
I should have it open for you
in... right now.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.046
Lauren,
this is restricted access.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.547
I cleared it with Justice.

35:52.550 --> 35:56.418
I had no intention of missing
the execution of this traitor.

36:04.395 --> 36:06.895
Marshall, we have a problem.

36:07.031 --> 36:09.299
Copy that, Mountaineer.
What's the problem?

36:09.300 --> 36:11.401
Motion sensor.
It's on a random sweep.

36:11.402 --> 36:14.496
- That wasn't on the schematics.
- Must be a secondary protocol.

36:14.572 --> 36:15.939
I've located The Hourglass.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.941
Can you disarm
the sensor remotely?

36:17.942 --> 36:20.076
I'm trying, but there are
a lot of dummy codes.

36:20.077 --> 36:21.278
I have to extrapolate each one.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.579
I've never seen
a system like this.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.208
Is there a repeating prefix
in the majority of the codes?

36:25.283 --> 36:26.349
86-86.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.918
It's an anchor-type design.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.888
Grab Dixon. He specced out
a similar system in Honduras.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.455
He'll know
what the back door is.

36:32.456 --> 36:33.390
Dixon.
I can't.

36:33.391 --> 36:36.588
He's downstairs as witness
to Mr. Sloane's execution.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.595
The execution is going forward?

36:38.596 --> 36:40.931
Yeah, at midnight.
I thought...

36:40.932 --> 36:43.867
You know, for some reason,
it makes me incredibly sad.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.936
I feel like you're the only
person I can talk to.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.537
Marshall, kill the grid now!

36:47.538 --> 36:50.038
Right. Sorry.
Talk later.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.970
Do you have any final words?

36:55.046 --> 36:57.480
I do.

36:57.481 --> 36:59.981
For you who pay witness...

37:00.651 --> 37:03.415
...I can only believe
there is a common thought

37:03.487 --> 37:05.188
amongst you all.

37:05.189 --> 37:07.987
This is as it should be.

37:09.927 --> 37:12.427
I do not disagree.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.401
My only request.

37:20.171 --> 37:23.902
That if my daughter
is in fact found alive...

37:25.643 --> 37:28.373
...that she understand
my actions.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.947
She understand
that this day's events

37:33.017 --> 37:35.517
are the net result...

37:37.355 --> 37:39.855
...of her father's passion...

37:40.558 --> 37:43.058
...to find her...

37:43.427 --> 37:45.927
...to know her...

37:47.431 --> 37:49.931
...to love her.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.274
We can't wait any longer.
I am going in.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.442
Stand down, Mountaineer.
I'm almost there.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.173
Raidon security detail
is two dozen strong.

38:03.047 --> 38:06.983
<i># I watched a change #</i>

38:07.051 --> 38:10.384
<i># In you #</i>

38:10.454 --> 38:17.360
<i># It's like
you never had wings #</i>

38:17.428 --> 38:23.628
<i># Now you feel so alive #</i>

38:23.701 --> 38:29.503
<i># I've watched you change #</i>

38:33.511 --> 38:38.471
<i># I took you home #</i>

38:40.885 --> 38:44.981
<i># Set you on the glass #</i>

38:48.125 --> 38:52.494
<i># I pulled off your wings #</i>

38:53.964 --> 38:57.400
<i># Then I laughed #</i>

38:58.836 --> 39:03.102
<i># I watched a change #</i>

39:03.174 --> 39:06.075
<i># In you #</i>

39:06.143 --> 39:13.072
<i># It's like
you never had wings #</i>

39:13.150 --> 39:19.646
<i># Now you feel so alive #</i>

39:19.724 --> 39:25.219
<i># I've watched you change #</i>

39:26.697 --> 39:30.793
<i># I watched a change #</i>

39:30.868 --> 39:34.031
<i># In you #</i>

39:34.105 --> 39:40.874
<i># It's like
you never had wings #</i>

39:40.945 --> 39:47.145
<i># Now you feel so alive #</i>

39:47.218 --> 39:52.656
<i># I've watched you change #</i>

39:54.158 --> 39:59.425
<i># It's like
you never had wings #</i>

39:59.497 --> 40:01.131
<i># Ah #</i>

40:01.132 --> 40:04.499
<i># Ah, ahh, ah #</i>

40:04.568 --> 40:07.731
<i># Ah, ahh, ah #</i>

40:07.805 --> 40:11.138
<i># Ah, ahh, ah #</i>

40:11.208 --> 40:14.541
<i># Ah, ahh, ah #</i>

40:14.612 --> 40:16.746
<i># Ahh, ah #</i>

40:21.452 --> 40:25.889
<i># I look at the cross #</i>

40:28.793 --> 40:32.661
<i># Then I look away... #</i>

40:43.841 --> 40:44.941
Sydney.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.442
Don't.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.612
There's nothing you can say.

40:59.824 --> 41:00.890
Sloane is dead.

41:00.891 --> 41:03.758
We can now locate The Passenger
without his interference.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.161
Not quite.

41:05.162 --> 41:09.121
The code key you retrieved
from the CIA is unusable.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.033
I can only assume that was
deliberate on their part.

41:12.102 --> 41:14.170
Vaughn played you.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.439
He's likely to try again.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.238
But that will be
his last mistake.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.411
I'm surprised you didn't get
the reference.

41:55.412 --> 41:58.575
Modified Kayexalate cocktail
washed with tetrodotoxin

41:58.649 --> 42:03.086
presented in a bottle
of Chambertin-Clos de Bèze.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.187
Just like we used in Saigon.

42:10.261 --> 42:11.861
But understand,

42:11.862 --> 42:14.695
this was not done
out of compassion.

42:14.765 --> 42:20.362
I orchestrated this because,
and only because,

42:20.437 --> 42:22.937
I need you.
