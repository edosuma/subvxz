WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.632
Whoa, this is scary.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.134
- You're Doing
- Everything Wrong?

00:09.260 --> 00:11.820
- Aw, Jessie! You're - reading a book about
- How to accessorize!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.227
Good for you! Admitting

00:17.228 --> 00:19.437
you're doing something

00:15.015 --> 00:19.437
wrong is the first step.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.024
Watch it, or my second step

00:23.025 --> 00:24.358
is going to be nailing

00:21.689 --> 00:24.358
your bedroom door shut.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.612
- No, this is
- a childcare book.

00:27.737 --> 00:28.843
I hope there's

00:28.844 --> 00:29.948
a chapter in there

00:27.737 --> 00:29.948
on inappropriate anger.

00:30.949 --> 00:32.637
I'm sorry. But I'm just

00:32.639 --> 00:34.326
worried about Zuri.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.933
According to this book,

00:35.934 --> 00:37.413
she should have outgrown

00:34.452 --> 00:37.413
her imaginary friends by now.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.894
Well, I haven't noticed

00:38.895 --> 00:40.249
her talking to Millie

00:37.538 --> 00:40.249
the Mermaid lately.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.376
- Millie! Swim out, swim out,
- wherever you are!

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
Then again, I also didn't

00:48.049 --> 00:50.050
notice when she wore a

00:46.046 --> 00:50.050
Halloween costume till March.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.407
I have a little

00:51.408 --> 00:52.637
problem here.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.203
I'll say. Lizard anklets

00:56.204 --> 00:57.934
are so last season.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.561
He's been so clingy lately.

01:00.562 --> 01:02.021
Like my mother.

01:04.941 --> 01:05.964
But without the mustache

01:05.965 --> 01:06.985

bring Mr. Kipling on

02:04.834 --> 02:08.378
our outing, Jessie.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.964
- He has been very
- lonely lately.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.445
Probably because Bertram's

02:11.446 --> 02:12.800
leg broke up with him.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.093
(GROWLING)

02:15.094 --> 02:16.387
He sighs all the time,

02:16.512 --> 02:18.160
and he just pushes

02:18.161 --> 02:19.807
his crickets around the dish.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.693
- Also, he insists I read him - nothing
but paranormal - Teen romance.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.271
I knew I saw drool

02:26.272 --> 02:27.272
on my Twilight books.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.272
I just thought it was mine.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.686
- I'm definitely
- Team Jacob.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.280
- How do I get you
- on Team Luke?

02:35.406 --> 02:36.407
Change your age,

02:36.408 --> 02:37.408
height, and abs.

02:38.868 --> 02:39.994
I have a six-pack.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.286
Yeah, of pudding cups.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.251
Well, Jacob may have abs,

02:46.252 --> 02:48.086
but he's just a big,

02:44.415 --> 02:48.086
glorified dog.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.879
- Hey, Luke, fetch!
- Whoa!

02:52.548 --> 02:54.050
(CHUCKLES)

02:54.174 --> 02:55.426
Zuri, don't you want

02:55.427 --> 02:56.677
to go play, too?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.575
Nah, I'll just hang here

02:58.576 --> 03:00.347
in the shade with

02:56.802 --> 03:00.347
Millie the Mermaid.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.829
She's wearing

03:02.830 --> 03:05.185
the coconut bra that

03:00.472 --> 03:05.185
gives her weird tan lines.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.431
- She should be wearing
- sun block. What am I saying?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.942
Come here.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.841
- Sweetie, wouldn't you rather
- have a more visible playmate?

03:19.951 --> 03:21.348
I mean, um, oh, what

03:21.349 --> 03:22.745
about that little girl?

03:25.623 --> 03:26.708
She's picking

03:26.709 --> 03:27.792
her nose.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.212
- Well, the girl's
- gotta eat, right?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.799
Okay, okay,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.216
I'll go mingle.

03:40.096 --> 03:41.931
- If Zuri doesn't make
- real friends soon,

03:42.056 --> 03:43.100
She's gonna end up walking

03:43.101 --> 03:44.142
down the aisle with her

03:42.056 --> 03:44.142
imaginary groom.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.706
- Then, have imaginary children - who never
come by with - Her imaginary grandchildren!

03:51.190 --> 03:52.733
Not necessarily.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.047
She could wind up as

03:54.048 --> 03:55.235
an old maid with 12

03:52.858 --> 03:55.235
imaginary cats.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.532
Jessie, you worry

03:59.533 --> 04:00.825
too much.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.869
Mrs. Arthur from our building

04:02.870 --> 04:04.787
has invisible friends, and she

04:00.950 --> 04:04.787
seems happy enough.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.913
Isn't it a beautiful day?

04:05.914 --> 04:06.914
Oh, it is not chilly.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.712
You have a soup stain

04:12.713 --> 04:14.797
on your sweater.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.797
Can't take you anywhere.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.279
Okay, Zuri is nothing

04:17.279 --> 04:18.425
like that woman!

04:18.550 --> 04:20.115
Pump your flipper, Millie!

04:20.116 --> 04:21.678
I'm getting tired.

04:22.805 --> 04:23.806
Jessie, come quick!

04:25.516 --> 04:27.205
Okay, please tell me

04:27.206 --> 04:28.894
Mr. Kipling did not

04:25.516 --> 04:28.894
eat a toddler!

04:29.020 --> 04:30.188
No, but he won't

04:30.189 --> 04:31.355
let anyone play

04:29.020 --> 04:31.355
on the dinosaur.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.857
EMMA: Hey, I know

04:32.858 --> 04:34.233
that longing look!

04:34.358 --> 04:35.484
It's the way that Bertram

04:35.485 --> 04:36.610
looks at his recliner.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.362
- And TV shows
- about cupcakes.

04:39.697 --> 04:40.844
Mr. Kipling

04:40.845 --> 04:41.991
is in love!

04:42.116 --> 04:43.680
Aw, I always knew

04:43.681 --> 04:45.244
this day would come!

04:45.369 --> 04:46.788
I need to have

04:46.789 --> 04:48.206
"the talk" with him.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.811
But first, someone

04:49.812 --> 04:51.291
needs to have

04:48.330 --> 04:51.291
"the talk" with me.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.255
Jessie, Jessie,

04:55.256 --> 04:56.380
I made a new friend!

04:56.505 --> 04:57.528
Really?

04:57.529 --> 04:58.549
That's great.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.217
Her name is Nana Banana

05:00.218 --> 05:01.760
and she's magical.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.223
(SIGHS)

05:05.347 --> 05:07.266
Another imaginary friend?

05:07.391 --> 05:08.913
(SCOFFS) I'd rather have

05:08.914 --> 05:10.435
the nose-picker. Even if

05:07.391 --> 05:10.435
she is two knuckles deep.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.964
RAVI: I cannot believe

05:16.965 --> 05:18.152
he ran away.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.362
- EMMA: I told you Mr. Kipling
- would be here.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.156
Well, he's not surrounded

05:22.157 --> 05:23.824
by the bones of innocent

05:20.487 --> 05:23.824
toddlers, so that's good.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.849
Aw, look, they're

05:26.850 --> 05:28.871
holding tails!

05:28.996 --> 05:30.769
Mr. Kipling,

05:30.770 --> 05:32.541
you reptilian Romeo!

05:34.252 --> 05:36.295
Freeze, you hippies!

05:36.296 --> 05:38.338
I may be old but I can

05:34.252 --> 05:38.338
still throw down!

05:40.591 --> 05:42.260
- Should we make
- a run for it?

05:42.384 --> 05:43.698
I think we can make

05:43.699 --> 05:45.012
a slow, leisurely walk for it.

05:46.264 --> 05:47.431
- Uh, sir.
- Yes?

05:47.556 --> 05:48.975
Our pet ran away,

05:48.976 --> 05:50.392
so we had to come

05:47.556 --> 05:50.392
get him.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.019
Oh, that is one big

06:01.572 --> 06:03.197
sprung a leak!

06:03.322 --> 06:05.324
Which is why we're just gonna

06:05.325 --> 06:07.326
take him home and patch

06:03.322 --> 06:07.326
him up. Come on, Fido.

06:17.044 --> 06:21.673
saw his girlfriend.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.218
He has been pacing

06:23.219 --> 06:24.635
like a caged animal.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.471
He is a caged animal.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.517
- He is a lizard in love,

Why will you not let me

06:33.144 --> 06:34.895
do him this solid?

Ravi, we can't go

06:39.193 --> 06:41.152
to the park every time

06:37.231 --> 06:41.152
Mr. Kipling needs a snuggle.

06:41.277 --> 06:42.841
If he's lonely,

06:42.842 --> 06:44.404
he'll just have to do

06:41.277 --> 06:44.404
what the rest of us do.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.490
- Eat ice cream - and listen
- To Adele songs.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.452

08:53.368 --> 08:54.659
I don't think my horses can

08:52.074 --> 08:54.659
fit through that little door.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.746
Can't you just get

08:57.747 --> 08:58.830
Shetland ponies?

09:00.499 --> 09:02.084
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

09:02.085 --> 09:03.668
Dolly Decorator,

09:00.499 --> 09:03.668
at your service.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.794
- I'm Rita Real Estate Doll. - Maybe we
dolls should - Rethink this remodel.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.384
(CHUCKLING)

09:10.509 --> 09:12.011
Well, I think we should

09:12.012 --> 09:13.512
rip this wall out

09:15.514 --> 09:16.681
and put in barn doors.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.103
I cannot believe

09:21.104 --> 09:22.521
you just did that

09:19.684 --> 09:22.521
without a permit!

09:22.646 --> 09:24.732
Hmm. So, what else

09:24.733 --> 09:26.817
do you want to change?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.444
Everything!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.049
- Uh, careful! A hasty remodel
- can just kill the curb appeal.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.890
This real estate lady

09:35.891 --> 09:37.495
is very negative.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.164
Let's fire her!

09:40.289 --> 09:42.249
Okay.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.876
Don't bother! I quit!

09:43.877 --> 09:45.377
And now, if you'll excuse me,

09:45.503 --> 09:46.504
I'm late for an

09:46.505 --> 09:47.505
open dollhouse.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.050
- Jessie! Wait!
- Yeah?

09:52.176 --> 09:53.302
Leave the doll.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.767
- This is
- so romantic.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.978
It is so kind of you both

10:02.979 --> 10:05.063
to help me bring Mr. Kipling

10:00.892 --> 10:05.063
his true love.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.190
Whatever! I'm just here

10:06.191 --> 10:07.191
to commit the crime

10:05.189 --> 10:07.191
of the century.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.673
We're borrowing

10:09.674 --> 10:11.111
a playground toy.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.877
- All right, crime - of the week.
But that's - As low as I'm going.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.598
We have the sledgehammer,

10:17.599 --> 10:20.037
the blowtorch,

10:21.746 --> 10:22.747
the plunger...

10:23.748 --> 10:25.310
- I don't think we're gonna
- need all that stuff.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.441
I was talking to Ravi.

10:27.442 --> 10:29.547
This is man's work.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.756
And we, we're men!

10:31.882 --> 10:34.842
- We will also need pointy - thingy,
um, twisty thingy, - Scrapey thingy...

10:38.263 --> 10:40.245
Guys, we don't need anything!

10:40.246 --> 10:42.226
All we need to do

10:38.263 --> 10:42.226
is lift up dino...

10:42.351 --> 10:44.771
Quiet, woman! Darn the socks,

10:44.772 --> 10:47.189
cook the curry, and let us

10:42.351 --> 10:47.189
handle our thingies.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.318
They're called tools,

10:51.319 --> 10:52.694
and we're gonna use them!

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
You guys are the tools.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.577
See you at home.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.039

Oh, why do bananas

11:09.337 --> 11:10.879

Why is Mrs. Arthur

11:21.245 --> 11:22.516

11:22.641 --> 11:24.185
She's dressed like that

11:24.186 --> 11:25.727
and that's the first

11:22.641 --> 11:25.727
question you ask?

11:27.646 --> 11:29.648
In India, the elderly

11:29.649 --> 11:31.650
are revered for their

11:27.646 --> 11:31.650
wisdom and experience.

11:40.390 --> 11:41.577

11:58.386 --> 11:59.386
we eat dessert before

11:57.384 --> 11:59.386

12:04.642 --> 12:06.852
Well, don't you kids have

12:06.853 --> 12:09.062
a dog? They're good for eating

12:04.642 --> 12:09.062

12:11.148 --> 12:12.691
We have a giant lizard.

- Come on.

Uh, so we could

find our way back

12:40.344 --> 12:42.346

12:49.186 --> 12:50.250
This is a really

12:50.251 --> 12:51.313
big apartment.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.879
With many confusing twists

12:54.880 --> 12:57.277

12:59.488 --> 13:01.011
You should not feed your

vegetables to Mr. Kipling.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.535
A, you need the vitamins.

a girl's looks go, so does he.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.580
Mmm-hmm.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.192
Hurry up and put

18:08.193 --> 18:09.756
the ex-Mrs. Kipling back

18:06.628 --> 18:09.756
before we get caught.

18:09.881 --> 18:10.882
A-ha! So it was you guys!

18:10.883 --> 18:11.883
Didn't I tell you hippies

18:09.881 --> 18:11.883
to stay out of the park?

18:15.804 --> 18:16.804
- No.
- No.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.598
Meow?

18:20.141 --> 18:21.810
I panicked again.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.209
Uh, look, Ranger Bill,

18:25.210 --> 18:26.773
let me explain.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.918
- See, we have this lizard,
- right, and he fell in love,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.090
And there was this clown

18:31.091 --> 18:33.237
and a lot of horn honking.

18:28.942 --> 18:33.237
So, there you have it.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.596
Okay, am I really old

18:36.597 --> 18:38.326
or was that really confusing?

18:39.327 --> 18:40.578
Both.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.144
Well, either way,

18:43.145 --> 18:44.207
I'm taking you punks in.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.167
- Um, I thought
- we were hippies.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.169
- Don't sass me,
- little girl.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.339
MRS. ARTHUR: Hello, Bill.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.425
Oh, hi, Mrs. Arthur.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.886
(CHUCKLING)

18:56.011 --> 18:57.200
I, uh, I haven't seen you

18:57.201 --> 18:58.388
in the park lately.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.353
- You don't see anything
- at the park, period.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.600
That's because I've

19:02.601 --> 19:04.769
been spending time

19:00.431 --> 19:04.769
with this lovely family.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.626
And they're no criminals.

19:06.627 --> 19:08.356
Look at those cute,

19:04.895 --> 19:08.356
little faces.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.006
Oh, okay,

19:12.007 --> 19:13.611
I'll let them go.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.031
But only because they're

19:16.032 --> 19:18.324
friends with a very, very,

19:13.737 --> 19:18.324
very lovely young lady.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.451
Oh, thank you.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.453
And you meant Nana.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.584
I'll text you.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.710
If I can find my phone.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.463
- Oh, I think I'll
- go this way.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.634
Yay! Nana Banana saved us

19:35.635 --> 19:37.010
from the slammer!

19:37.135 --> 19:38.825
Yes, but I'm sentencing you

19:38.826 --> 19:40.513
to two weeks of no TV.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.161
You know that means

19:42.162 --> 19:43.683
you'll just have

19:40.638 --> 19:43.683
to entertain us, right?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.449
- Okay, one week.
- Now go play for a sec.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.021
Nana?

19:48.146 --> 19:49.313
Mmm-hmm?

19:49.439 --> 19:50.941
- I'm really sorry
- I kicked you out.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.902
Oh, here, sit down.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.028
This whole thing started

19:55.029 --> 19:56.029
because this stupid book

19:56.154 --> 19:58.091
- got me worried about
- Zuri's imaginary friends.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.345
Well, there's nothing wrong

19:59.346 --> 20:00.575
with imaginary friends.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.452
You know, I still talk

20:02.453 --> 20:04.203
to my late husband,

20:00.700 --> 20:04.203
Harry, every day.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.727
Aw. He doesn't answer,

20:05.728 --> 20:07.124
does he?

20:07.248 --> 20:08.875
No, but he never answered

20:08.876 --> 20:10.501
when he was alive, either.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.756
The point is

20:14.757 --> 20:16.091
it makes me happy.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.342
Never underestimate

20:17.343 --> 20:18.468
the importance of

20:16.215 --> 20:18.468
the friends we can't see.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.932
Between you and me,

20:22.933 --> 20:24.975
I sometimes still talk

20:20.887 --> 20:24.975
to my first dog, Champ.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.101
Oh, that's just weird.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.270
(CHUCKLES)

20:29.395 --> 20:30.856
Oh, look, Jessie.

20:30.857 --> 20:32.315
You got great kids.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.315
You got great instincts.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.255
Why don't you just stop

20:34.256 --> 20:36.069
worrying so much,

20:32.440 --> 20:36.069
or you're gonna slip up.

20:36.194 --> 20:39.154
- Oh, speaking of which, - I'm sorry
about the banana - Peel on the stairs.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.327
No hard peelings.

20:44.452 --> 20:45.599
Whoa, that's a good one!

20:45.600 --> 20:46.746
(LAUGHS)

20:46.871 --> 20:48.019
Go ahead. No, you know

20:48.020 --> 20:49.166
you want to. Go ahead.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.211
(LAUGHING)

20:53.336 --> 20:54.212
- Do it like you mean it.
- Okay!

20:54.337 --> 20:55.338
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:57.590 --> 20:59.467
Good girl.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.115
Thanks. Nana, would you like

21:01.116 --> 21:02.637
to come over and join us

20:59.592 --> 21:02.637
for dinner tonight?

21:02.762 --> 21:03.888
- I would love...
- Nana!

21:04.014 --> 21:05.807
- I asked Ranger Bill
- if he wanted to have

21:05.932 --> 21:07.142
A play date with you tonight,

21:07.143 --> 21:08.351
and he said yes!

21:08.476 --> 21:10.187
Oh!

21:10.311 --> 21:11.584
He wants to take you

21:11.585 --> 21:12.856
to something called

21:10.311 --> 21:12.856
an "early bird special."

21:12.981 --> 21:14.170
Is that so? Jessie,

21:14.171 --> 21:15.358
can I take a rain check?

21:15.483 --> 21:18.803
- This old clown still has - a few tricks up her sleeve.
- See you at Tai Chi later.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.554
Yep. Use them

21:23.555 --> 21:24.701
or lose them.

21:24.826 --> 21:25.827
That's it. I'm working

21:25.828 --> 21:26.828
on it. Come on, Bill.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.436
Looks like we got

21:31.437 --> 21:32.583
two dinosaurs together

21:30.289 --> 21:32.583
after all.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.629
So, everything

21:35.630 --> 21:36.838
turned out fine.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.838
(CHUCKLES)

21:41.384 --> 21:42.385
Run!

21:42.510 --> 21:43.803
(ZURI SCREAMS)

21:48.432 --> 21:50.672
- Wow, we're moving slower
- than Bertram on laundry day.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.272
Or any day.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.727
- Tai Chi promotes longevity. - Don't you
want to look - As good as me someday?

22:02.572 --> 22:03.781
Is that a trick question?

22:05.616 --> 22:07.493
- Jessie, Jessie,
- I made a new friend!

22:07.618 --> 22:08.619
Really? That's great.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.620
Hi, it's very nice

22:07.618 --> 22:09.620
to meet you.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.772
What are you looking at?

22:14.773 --> 22:16.419
He's over there.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.629
That's a real boy.

22:17.630 --> 22:18.713
I can see him!

22:18.838 --> 22:20.215
We all can, Jessie.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.509
I can't.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.715
- His friend, Herbie the Hippo, - really
hit it off with - Millie the Mermaid!

22:28.306 --> 22:29.849
- Wanna come
- play with us?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.914
I'd love to.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.853
Come on.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.398
Uh, Bertram, you, uh,

22:36.399 --> 22:38.816
need a little help there?

22:38.942 --> 22:40.047
No. Actually, he's

22:40.048 --> 22:41.152
kind of growing on me.
