00:33.006 --> 00:37.605
Who are we,
after all? Are we where we live?

00:37.606 --> 00:40.405
Are we the rituals
we celebrate year after year

00:40.406 --> 00:42.926
as the seasons roll round?

00:49.047 --> 00:55.765
Are we our hopes and our desires?
Are we what we choose to be and do?

00:55.766 --> 00:59.486
Or are we shaped by accident
and not our own design?

01:09.566 --> 01:12.205
And they lived happily ever after.
The end.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.325
Course they did.
It's why we read them, isn't it?

01:15.326 --> 01:17.485
- I don't read them.
- Why not?

01:17.486 --> 01:19.885
I don't believe in love
at first sight.

01:19.886 --> 01:23.726
Who does? But there's nothing wrong
with a bit of escapism.

01:24.766 --> 01:27.206
I'll leave that there for you,
Lucille.

01:35.206 --> 01:39.525
Here's the list of appointments
for today's cervical smear clinic.

01:39.526 --> 01:43.005
A copy for Nurse Franklin
and one for me.

01:43.006 --> 01:45.125
Thank you, Miss Higgins.

01:45.126 --> 01:48.885
- How many ladies altogether?
- 15, would you believe?

01:48.886 --> 01:51.005
That's excellent!

01:51.006 --> 01:53.925
There's always a sense of
anticipation when we start a new

01:53.926 --> 01:56.685
clinic. Especially one
as pioneering as this one.

01:56.686 --> 01:59.925
Let's serve tea and biscuits
straight away, in case of nerves.

01:59.926 --> 02:02.725
We have to remember none of them
will have had this test before.

02:02.726 --> 02:05.165
I might need a cup.
First time for them,

02:05.166 --> 02:06.886
first time for us, too.

02:08.566 --> 02:10.205
- All set?
- I think so.

02:10.205 --> 02:13.525
This new cervical cancer test
will save lives, Shelagh,

02:13.526 --> 02:16.125
so I am thrilled to be asked to
participate.

02:16.126 --> 02:19.565
While I do not wish
to rain on your parade, Dr Turner,

02:19.566 --> 02:23.525
won't it also add considerably
to the surgery's workload?

02:23.526 --> 02:26.885
I could always ask the council
to give us some support,

02:26.886 --> 02:30.565
but I don't want them
to think that we can't manage.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.485
They're trusting us to deliver this.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.646
We'll manage. I'm sure of it.

02:42.726 --> 02:45.374
George and I have waited
a long time for this.

02:46.086 --> 02:49.645
After we lost our first, we didn't
think we'd get another chance.

02:49.646 --> 02:50.925
Then, when we found out,

02:50.926 --> 02:53.325
I was scared I'd be no good
at being pregnant.

02:53.326 --> 02:56.125
And now I'm scared I'd be
no good at being a mum.

02:56.126 --> 02:59.245
Everything's going to be
absolutely splendid.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.005
Baby's ticking over nicely,

03:01.006 --> 03:03.485
and you've been a regular
at our Mothercraft classes.

03:03.486 --> 03:05.405
I'm going to drag
George along to the next one.

03:05.406 --> 03:09.054
I think he's a bit embarrassed
that folk might think he's soft.

03:17.366 --> 03:18.966
The first one's ready.

03:20.326 --> 03:23.045
There we are, ready.

03:23.046 --> 03:25.405
Mrs Porter is first up.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.166
I'll call her in.

03:29.486 --> 03:31.445
Mrs Porter, please.

03:31.446 --> 03:33.126
In for a penny...

03:44.686 --> 03:47.165
If men had what we've got
down there,

03:47.166 --> 03:50.485
- they wouldn't be getting scraped.
- Consider yourself the vanguard.

03:50.486 --> 03:53.405
A few moments' discomfort and you're
helping to protect yourself,

03:53.406 --> 03:56.605
your daughters and the generations
of women who come after you.

03:56.606 --> 03:58.845
You're a heroine, Mrs Porter.

03:58.846 --> 04:02.285
- Righto.
- How are we doing, Nurse?

04:02.286 --> 04:05.005
- Ready, Doctor.
- Can we get on with it?

04:05.006 --> 04:08.065
I need to get my sheets out
before the weather turns.

04:12.726 --> 04:14.566
Just relax, Mrs Porter.

04:15.766 --> 04:18.326
The speculum may feel a little cold.

04:24.606 --> 04:26.845
And that's it done.

04:26.846 --> 04:31.086
- That wasn't too bad, was it?
- I've had worse up there, believe me.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.925
Bronwyn Parry, please.

04:40.926 --> 04:42.685
That's me.

04:42.686 --> 04:45.166
But my name's Lois, not Bronwyn.

04:49.806 --> 04:51.725
Bronwyn is my mum.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.525
She got the letter but didn't want
to come, so I'm here in her place.

04:54.526 --> 04:57.405
Your mother will have been invited
because she's over 35

04:57.406 --> 04:59.365
and has had a baby.
I'm very happy to say

04:59.366 --> 05:01.285
that you're not at risk of
developing

05:01.286 --> 05:02.805
cervical cancer at the moment.

05:02.806 --> 05:04.845
Can I just have the test anyway?

05:04.846 --> 05:08.325
I'm getting married soon and I want
to check everything's... you know.

05:08.326 --> 05:10.765
If it's contraception
you're concerned about,

05:10.766 --> 05:14.525
- we do have a Women's Advice Clinic.
- The wedding's in a month.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.845
Can't you just take a look, please?

05:16.846 --> 05:19.726
Why? Is there something
worrying you?

05:21.886 --> 05:23.445
I haven't had a period.

05:23.446 --> 05:24.806
Since when?

05:26.206 --> 05:29.245
Ever. I've never had one.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.806
Not ever.

05:35.446 --> 05:37.245
What colour do you want?

05:37.246 --> 05:39.485
I better take both, just in case.

05:39.486 --> 05:42.685
Sometimes I think it's a boy
cos the amount it kicks,

05:42.686 --> 05:45.085
but then I think it's a girl cos it
goes all quiet

05:45.086 --> 05:46.845
when Sing Something Simple's on.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.285
Well, whatever it is,
it'll be a little joy.

05:50.286 --> 05:53.365
Why don't you take the lemon?
That will do both.

05:53.366 --> 05:55.645
Give us a yard
and a half of that, then.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.245
George will go daft when he sees
I'm knitting more cardies.

05:58.246 --> 06:00.205
We can't move for them as it is.

06:00.206 --> 06:02.445
I keep seeing your George in that
cafe round the corner,

06:02.446 --> 06:04.245
tucking in to his fry-ups.

06:04.246 --> 06:06.765
I said to him, he'd better watch it
or you'll be coming to me

06:06.766 --> 06:08.965
for expanders for his trousers.

06:08.966 --> 06:11.446
- Sandy Lawrence's caff?
- That's the one.

06:17.006 --> 06:19.846
I'll be as quick
and as gentle as possible.

06:26.606 --> 06:28.805
All done, Miss Parry.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.165
Now,

06:30.166 --> 06:33.886
why don't you sit up, get yourself
sorted and we'll have a chat.

06:35.846 --> 06:37.729
There's nothing wrong, is there?

06:43.926 --> 06:46.766
First batch done
and ready to go to the lab.

06:47.966 --> 06:49.725
What, is it? What's wrong?

06:49.726 --> 06:53.165
I've just seen a young woman
who hasn't started her periods.

06:53.166 --> 06:58.005
She's 22 years old, Shelagh, and
I couldn't find her cervix, and she

06:58.006 --> 06:59.805
has a very short vagina.

06:59.806 --> 07:02.765
I've referred her St Cuthbert's
as a matter of urgency,

07:02.766 --> 07:05.445
but she's about to get married.

07:05.446 --> 07:07.725
No.

07:07.726 --> 07:10.086
I do hope her young man
is a nice one.

07:19.966 --> 07:22.005
I knew something wasn't right.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.725
When all the girls in school
were getting their monthlies

07:24.726 --> 07:26.685
and I... I wasn't.

07:26.686 --> 07:28.285
What about your mother?

07:28.286 --> 07:31.165
She must've noticed you weren't
using sanitary protection.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.645
I lied to her. I see.

07:33.646 --> 07:36.605
She'd buy me sanitary towels
and I didn't know what to do

07:36.606 --> 07:38.845
with them,
cos I didn't want her to realise.

07:38.846 --> 07:40.965
So I said I'd put them in the bin
myself

07:40.966 --> 07:43.325
cos I was too embarrassed
for her to do it.

07:43.326 --> 07:45.246
I felt so bad lying to her.

07:46.326 --> 07:48.485
You might want to tell her now,

07:48.486 --> 07:51.525
then she can go
to the hospital with you.

07:51.526 --> 07:53.445
No! Don't tell her!

07:53.446 --> 07:54.966
Please.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.445
How did you get on?
Did you get them? You know...

08:09.446 --> 08:12.165
They said I've got to go to
the Women's Advice Clinic for them,

08:12.166 --> 08:14.872
so they'll make an appointment
and sort me out.

08:15.366 --> 08:18.485
Good. That's good.
Hey, not long now.

08:18.486 --> 08:21.251
We won't have to wait
that much longer. Come on.

08:30.886 --> 08:33.885
- That does not sound good.
- It certainly doesn't sound healthy.

08:33.885 --> 08:35.605
Apologies, ladies.

08:35.606 --> 08:38.885
I offer you a lift home
and you'd have been quicker walking.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.885
It might be your head gasket,
Nurse Crane.

08:41.885 --> 08:44.685
Morris Minors are wonderfully
reliable little cars,

08:44.686 --> 08:47.166
but sometimes even
they can let you down.

08:49.646 --> 08:51.885
My father's
a veteran car enthusiast.

08:51.886 --> 08:54.004
He taught me a little about engines.

08:58.006 --> 09:01.365
I'm afraid you both might have to
get out and push.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.837
This is becoming a bit of a habit,
Phyllis.

09:10.286 --> 09:11.526
Dear.

09:14.646 --> 09:16.165
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

09:16.166 --> 09:20.212
It's not that, it's just er,
I'm not hungry. I had a big lunch.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.565
- What did you have?
- Bacon, couple of eggs,

09:22.566 --> 09:24.565
sausages, three rounds of toast.

09:24.566 --> 09:26.525
Blimey!

09:26.526 --> 09:29.405
I thought I was meant to be
eating for two!

09:29.406 --> 09:31.405
Where did you go?

09:31.406 --> 09:33.605
The caff near work.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.879
Does Sandy Lawrence
still work there?

09:35.881 --> 09:37.405
Think so. Why?

09:37.406 --> 09:39.446
Just wondering.

09:45.446 --> 09:48.365
- Sister Frances, I have a task for you.
- Yes, Sister?

09:48.366 --> 09:51.845
I'd like you to supervise
our Mothercraft class this evening.

09:51.846 --> 09:55.085
It's our "bathing baby" session,
one of our most popular,

09:55.086 --> 09:57.725
and the fathers are encouraged
to attend.

09:57.726 --> 10:00.085
I think you'd get
a great deal from it.

10:00.086 --> 10:02.925
I'm very sorry, Sister,
but I can't do it.

10:02.926 --> 10:06.165
I've been petrified of speaking
in public since I was seven

10:06.166 --> 10:08.925
and I was the narrator
in the Nativity play.

10:08.926 --> 10:12.645
And I froze just as the wise men
were arriving at the stable.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.705
They didn't know if they
were coming or going. I see.

10:16.686 --> 10:20.325
Well, I'm sure Nurse Dyer would be
prepared to offer her moral support.

10:20.326 --> 10:22.365
Of course, I'd be happy to.

10:22.366 --> 10:24.805
Thank you.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.246
Thank you so much.

10:32.126 --> 10:34.845
Better get a move on, love, you'll
be late for work.

10:34.846 --> 10:36.925
- Got the morning off.
- You're not ill, are you?

10:36.926 --> 10:39.725
Course not. I have to go and order
the wedding cake

10:39.726 --> 10:42.445
and this is the only time
the baker could do it.

10:42.446 --> 10:45.045
- Don't you want me to come with you?
- No, it's fine. I can do it.

10:45.046 --> 10:47.285
I thought we could pick it
together.

10:47.286 --> 10:49.325
I was looking forward to it.

10:49.326 --> 10:52.765
Sorry, Mum, but I really want to do
that one thing by myself.

10:52.766 --> 10:56.765
We've done everything else together,
haven't we? It's just the cake.

10:56.766 --> 10:58.566
That's all.

11:19.086 --> 11:20.646
Miss Parry?

11:42.486 --> 11:43.726
And...

11:45.766 --> 11:48.178
What do you notice about
the genital area?

11:49.566 --> 11:51.125
Anyone?

11:51.126 --> 11:54.085
Come on.
It's staring you in the face.

11:54.086 --> 11:56.845
- Lack of pubic hair, sir.
- Correct.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.846
And why might that be?

12:01.326 --> 12:03.405
Any thoughts?

12:03.406 --> 12:06.085
Underactive adrenal gland, sir?

12:06.086 --> 12:08.646
Possibly, but unlikely in this case.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.846
Just relax, this won't take long.

12:30.286 --> 12:32.286
Right, Nurse Crane, turn her over.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.925
It appears you're having some
difficulty

12:40.926 --> 12:43.765
persuading your vehicle
to obey your command.

12:43.766 --> 12:47.125
Thankfully your powers
of observation have not deserted

12:47.126 --> 12:51.125
you, Sister, even though my engine
seems to have given up the ghost.

12:51.126 --> 12:54.846
Perhaps you are being
a little too demanding.

12:55.766 --> 13:00.205
A gentle persuasion is often more
effective than a heavy hand.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.325
Best get a mechanic to take a look,
Nurse Crane.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.925
I know a bloke who comes
highly recommended.

13:05.926 --> 13:09.366
A mechanic who comes highly
recommended? Gold dust!

13:12.766 --> 13:15.445
It's perfectly normal
to feel nervous

13:15.446 --> 13:17.485
the first time you bath baby,

13:17.486 --> 13:20.966
but the important thing
to remember is...

13:22.126 --> 13:24.205
...is...

13:24.206 --> 13:26.285
...is...

13:26.286 --> 13:30.445
...to test the temperature of the
water before lowering baby in.

13:30.446 --> 13:32.726
So, you do this using your elbow.

13:34.326 --> 13:37.045
Dear! Dear, dear!

13:37.046 --> 13:40.165
You'll be brilliant.
They're just people.

13:40.166 --> 13:43.485
Imagine them naked,
then they'll hold no fear.

13:52.686 --> 13:54.365
Hello. Can I help?

13:54.366 --> 13:56.765
Good morning, Miss,
I'm sorry to bother you,

13:56.766 --> 13:59.285
but I'm looking for Nurse Phyllis
Crane. Mr Buckle sent me.

13:59.286 --> 14:00.925
It's about her car.

14:00.926 --> 14:03.325
She's out on call just now,
but she left her keys.

14:03.326 --> 14:04.926
Come in, I'll get them.

14:25.246 --> 14:28.685
My goodness, Miss Parry!
Whatever's happened?!

14:28.686 --> 14:31.445
- Are you all right?
- Dr Turner, I... I have to see him.

14:31.446 --> 14:33.606
Please! I'm afraid he's not here.

14:43.606 --> 14:45.045
Come on, George.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.245
It was horrible.

14:54.246 --> 14:57.805
He had these students there,
all men,

14:57.806 --> 15:01.125
and he didn't tell me
what he was doing or why.

15:01.126 --> 15:03.485
He found something in my stomach,
I know he did.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.805
Here.

15:05.806 --> 15:07.445
Don't worry.

15:07.446 --> 15:09.211
We'll get to the bottom of it.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.966
My Boy Lollipop by Millie Small

15:31.526 --> 15:32.566
Hello?

15:38.726 --> 15:41.085
I thought you should know,
you're causing an obstruction.

15:41.086 --> 15:44.645
My apologies, Nurse. I haven't
quite mastered the ability to

15:44.646 --> 15:48.165
diagnose my patient without
a good look at the chassis.

15:48.166 --> 15:53.325
Cyril Robinson. I better not
shake. No, best not.

15:53.326 --> 15:55.365
As long as you don't think I'm rude.

15:55.366 --> 15:58.805
- Just a bit loud.
- I'll keep it down.

15:58.806 --> 16:02.205
Even though it's something
of a sacrifice, Cyril,

16:02.206 --> 16:06.085
the last cherry macaroon is yours.

16:06.086 --> 16:08.045
I'm honoured, Sister.

16:08.046 --> 16:11.485
I see you have already made
the acquaintance of our dear

16:11.486 --> 16:13.045
Nurse Anderson.

16:13.046 --> 16:17.166
She used to be a librarian before
she found her true path.

16:18.326 --> 16:20.325
See you inside, Sister.

16:20.326 --> 16:22.646
Nice to meet you, Mr Robinson.

16:29.446 --> 16:33.325
So, this is the engine. It takes
fuel from the tank

16:33.326 --> 16:35.125
and ignites it with a spark.

16:35.126 --> 16:39.165
So, the workings of this automobile

16:39.166 --> 16:43.045
are not unlike the workings
of the human body.

16:43.046 --> 16:48.605
It requires fuel to power it,
a heart to keep it running,

16:48.606 --> 16:51.725
lights to shine the way,

16:51.726 --> 16:55.765
and a system that prevents
overheating.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.649
I couldn't have put that better myself.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.085
You all right, Mrs Sharp?

17:09.086 --> 17:10.765
Sorry, my husband's late.

17:10.766 --> 17:12.885
Don't worry,
I can be Dad for now.

17:12.886 --> 17:14.605
I don't know where he's got to.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.253
I'll kill him when I see him.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.565
Now, Sister Frances is going to
demonstrate the best way to

17:21.566 --> 17:24.390
hold baby as you start to lower
it into the bath.

17:47.566 --> 17:51.406
The important thing is to
support baby's head.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.326
Like this.

17:56.446 --> 17:58.966
We want baby to feel safe
and secure.

18:00.206 --> 18:02.405
The last thing you want is
a wriggling infant

18:02.406 --> 18:03.886
near a bath of water.

18:05.366 --> 18:07.725
That's it, Mr Barton, but gently.

18:07.726 --> 18:09.686
You don't want to drown baby.

18:10.726 --> 18:14.965
Just lower baby
slowly into the water,

18:14.966 --> 18:18.045
so it covers their tummy
and their legs,

18:18.046 --> 18:19.526
then gently splash.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.885
That's great.

18:23.886 --> 18:25.605
Well done.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.245
That's it, Mr Barton,
support the head.

18:28.246 --> 18:31.125
The head. Little splashes.

18:31.126 --> 18:33.725
You don't want to cause a flood.

18:33.726 --> 18:36.125
What do you do
when water gets in it?

18:36.126 --> 18:40.085
You just pull its
leg off... and pour.

18:40.086 --> 18:43.526
Although I wouldn't try that
on an actual baby. THEY LAUGH

18:48.686 --> 18:52.205
There you go, George. You know, if
you're not careful, you're going to

18:52.206 --> 18:54.885
- grow a pair of trotters.
- Thought I'd find you here.

18:54.886 --> 18:58.005
- I see you're being well taken care of.
- I was hungry.

18:58.006 --> 19:01.125
We've got food at home.
You missed the class, George.

19:01.126 --> 19:04.085
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Charming.

19:04.086 --> 19:06.205
Come on, we're going.

19:06.206 --> 19:09.485
George, don't forget your butty,
whatever you do.

19:09.486 --> 19:12.006
I'll take that, thank you very much.

19:19.006 --> 19:22.525
That's it, Angela, stand still.

19:23.598 --> 19:26.805
You've grown a whole inch!
Clever girl.

19:26.806 --> 19:29.605
Come on, May,
let's measure you, too.

19:29.606 --> 19:33.525
We can write your name
next to everyone else's.

19:38.686 --> 19:43.085
Honestly, Patrick, if you could have
seen how upset Lois Parry was.

19:43.086 --> 19:46.445
Perhaps I shouldn't have rushed
to get her an appointment.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.526
Kenley is always
a bit of a blunt instrument.

19:50.726 --> 19:53.405
I could've asked for a more
sympathetic consultant

19:53.406 --> 19:55.085
if we'd been prepared to wait.

19:55.086 --> 19:58.285
I do think any further diagnosis
would be better coming from you,

19:58.286 --> 20:01.605
Patrick. We could get
the information from Mr Kenley

20:01.606 --> 20:04.085
and pass it on with Trixie's help.

20:04.086 --> 20:07.485
- Lois seems to like her.
- That's a good idea.

20:07.486 --> 20:09.685
I do feel a bit out of my depth,

20:09.686 --> 20:13.565
and I can only imagine what that
poor girl is feeling.

20:13.566 --> 20:16.205
Dad, can I take these?

20:16.206 --> 20:18.965
They've been in the cupboard
since the Jurassic age.

20:18.966 --> 20:21.165
The Triassic, more likely.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.525
I bought them in case
we ever got to the Cup Final.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.485
- Where are you going with those?
- Clive's.

20:25.486 --> 20:28.725
There's a few of us going round
to listen to A Hard Day's Night.

20:28.726 --> 20:32.205
The Beatles do seem a bit
nicer than the Rolling Stones.

20:32.206 --> 20:36.245
And Paul McCartney's mother
was a midwife. We just have to check

20:36.246 --> 20:38.926
if you're tall enough
to drink beer.

20:40.486 --> 20:42.846
It seems you are.

20:46.126 --> 20:49.525
I've replaced the head gasket
and it's still refusing to budge.

20:49.526 --> 20:52.605
- It's probably the valves.
- How long will that take to fix?

20:52.606 --> 20:54.405
Two days.

20:54.406 --> 20:56.005
Maybe three.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.365
Two days will have to suffice,
please.

20:58.366 --> 21:01.805
I'm not prepared to do my rounds
on a bus any longer than that.

21:01.806 --> 21:04.565
The timetables
are a work of fiction.

21:04.566 --> 21:07.765
Nurse Crane? Still not working?

21:07.766 --> 21:10.725
It would appear not,
and I have rounds to do.

21:10.726 --> 21:12.445
Well, I'm off-duty today.

21:12.446 --> 21:15.446
Please allow me
to give you a lift.

21:18.326 --> 21:20.366
Very well. Thank you.

21:34.206 --> 21:37.565
When things don't seem quite
right on the outside,

21:37.566 --> 21:42.086
it often means that there are more
worrying problems on the inside.

21:43.606 --> 21:48.045
When Mr Kenley examined you,
he discovered that your vagina

21:48.046 --> 21:52.726
was much shorter than it should be,
and he couldn't find a womb.

21:55.726 --> 21:57.726
Do you understand, Lois?

21:58.966 --> 22:02.366
He discovered that you have
a very rare condition.

22:03.846 --> 22:06.405
Where your ovaries would
normally be,

22:06.406 --> 22:08.686
he found two male testes growing.

22:10.566 --> 22:13.886
It's called
testicular feminisation syndrome.

22:17.046 --> 22:19.125
I know this must be a terrible
shock, Lois.

22:19.126 --> 22:22.085
We'll help you in any way
that we can.

22:22.086 --> 22:26.285
In very simple terms,
it means that, on the outside,

22:26.286 --> 22:31.205
you look like a woman,
but, genetically, you're male.

22:31.206 --> 22:34.325
No! Please, no, no.

22:34.326 --> 22:36.645
Please, I can't, I can't...

22:36.646 --> 22:40.125
Nurse Franklin and I
have talked about all of this,

22:40.126 --> 22:42.805
so I'm going to leave you
with her now,

22:42.806 --> 22:45.326
and you can take your time
and take it in.

22:56.166 --> 23:01.645
Is he saying that though I look
like a woman, I'm really a man?

23:01.646 --> 23:03.325
Is that what he's saying?

23:03.326 --> 23:06.605
He's saying that you're
a mixture of both sexes.

23:06.606 --> 23:10.046
God! God!

23:11.846 --> 23:13.126
I don't have a womb!

23:14.446 --> 23:18.325
How am I going to have children?
How am I going to tell Paul?

23:18.326 --> 23:20.125
He wants to be a dad so badly.

23:20.126 --> 23:23.365
There are other ways
to be a mother, Lois,

23:23.366 --> 23:25.885
without becoming pregnant.

23:25.886 --> 23:27.046
What about...

23:28.446 --> 23:30.245
What about...

23:30.246 --> 23:32.525
How will we...

23:32.526 --> 23:34.086
...on the wedding night?

23:35.366 --> 23:38.805
An intimate relationship
might still be possible.

23:38.806 --> 23:41.205
How can we have
a relationship at all,

23:41.206 --> 23:43.566
when I'm not who Paul thinks I am?

23:48.246 --> 23:51.165
You don't have to drive me
to every house call, you know.

23:51.166 --> 23:54.045
I'm perfectly capable of using
public transport.

23:54.046 --> 23:57.525
I have no doubt you'd be perfectly
capable of doing most things,

23:57.526 --> 23:59.926
but I'm happy to be of service.

24:00.966 --> 24:06.285
I would be delighted if you'd do me
the honour of spending

24:06.286 --> 24:09.285
some more time in my company.

24:09.286 --> 24:12.639
Perhaps a visit to the theatre
this time? Or dinner, even?

24:16.726 --> 24:18.526
Look, we're here already!

24:22.646 --> 24:23.926
Thank you.

24:28.806 --> 24:30.405
Patrick...

24:30.406 --> 24:33.285
I didn't make a very good
job of that, I'm afraid.

24:33.286 --> 24:36.325
This might make you feel
a little better.

24:36.326 --> 24:39.365
The Local Health Authority have
written to commend us

24:39.366 --> 24:41.965
for the way we've handled
the cervical smear clinic.

24:41.966 --> 24:45.725
- They want us to increase our numbers.
- This is good, isn't it?

24:45.726 --> 24:48.605
Think how many more women we'll
be able to screen.

24:48.606 --> 24:50.526
But you're going to need help.

24:51.136 --> 24:53.482
Do you think Trixie
would be interested?

24:53.484 --> 24:55.372
I'm sure she would.

24:56.686 --> 25:00.245
Hello, pet, you're late.
I've kept you some tea.

25:00.246 --> 25:03.925
- It's in the oven.
- Thanks, Mum, but I'm not that hungry.

25:03.926 --> 25:06.905
- But Paul will be here in a minute.
- So he will.

25:06.907 --> 25:08.365
Is everything all right?

25:08.366 --> 25:10.125
Have you two had a row or something?

25:10.126 --> 25:12.365
No. I'm just tired.

25:12.366 --> 25:15.885
This'll cheer you up.
The invitations arrived.

25:15.886 --> 25:18.285
They're so fancy, Lois.

25:18.286 --> 25:19.885
Show them, Nancy.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.486
I'll look at them later.

25:24.646 --> 25:26.645
Has it started? Is it coming?

25:26.646 --> 25:29.885
No, Mr Sharp, it's just
your wife's body practising.

25:29.886 --> 25:33.325
Your clever baby's getting ready.
We call these Braxton Hicks.

25:33.326 --> 25:36.725
I like to think of them as a dress
rehearsal for the opening night.

25:36.726 --> 25:38.685
How does my body know to do that?

25:38.686 --> 25:40.885
When you think about it,
it's beyond belief.

25:40.886 --> 25:42.645
Where are you going?

25:42.646 --> 25:44.885
Out. I said I'd meet
Marty for a pint.

25:44.886 --> 25:46.646
I won't be late.

26:07.886 --> 26:09.925
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:09.926 --> 26:12.925
I... I shouldn't have.
I... I just... I'm sorry.

26:12.926 --> 26:15.845
- I just don't want to.
- What's wrong?

26:15.846 --> 26:17.285
Nothing.

26:17.286 --> 26:20.639
Why does something have to be wrong?
I just don't want to.

26:21.126 --> 26:23.886
Why don't you go
and I'll see you tomorrow?

26:56.366 --> 26:59.365
Did I hear that Nurse Crane's
mechanic has been teaching you

26:59.366 --> 27:01.645
all about car engines,
Sister Monica Joan?

27:01.646 --> 27:05.725
Cyril is much more
than a mechanic, my dear.

27:05.726 --> 27:08.885
He is a scholar who spends
his evenings

27:08.886 --> 27:11.365
in the pursuit of learning

27:11.366 --> 27:14.726
and his Sundays
in the worship of God.

27:15.726 --> 27:18.125
He's a part-time preacher,
you know.

27:18.126 --> 27:19.885
Really?

27:19.886 --> 27:21.686
Did you know that, Lucille?

27:23.646 --> 27:25.645
Why would I know it?

27:25.646 --> 27:27.645
I just thought you might.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.125
What's he studying, Sister?
Do you know?

27:30.126 --> 27:31.645
Engineering.

27:31.646 --> 27:33.366
The civil kind.

27:34.366 --> 27:38.246
The kind most suited to a young
gentleman of his disposition.

27:39.246 --> 27:41.725
Well, he sounds most interesting
and...

27:41.726 --> 27:43.245
...eligible.

27:43.246 --> 27:47.606
Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have my own studies to attend.

28:37.886 --> 28:40.365
Mrs Turner telephoned to tell me
you were coming.

28:40.366 --> 28:42.126
She was very kind.

28:43.366 --> 28:45.645
She said I would find you here.

28:45.646 --> 28:47.885
I don't know what to do, Nurse.

28:47.886 --> 28:50.645
I just don't understand any of it.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.126
I know Dr Turner said that I'm...

28:54.366 --> 28:56.646
...I'm a man inside...

28:57.646 --> 29:00.365
...but I look like a woman...

29:00.366 --> 29:02.125
...don't I?

29:02.126 --> 29:05.686
I still want to wear dresses
and make-up and do my hair nice.

29:06.886 --> 29:09.045
I still have those feelings
for Paul.

29:09.046 --> 29:12.125
If I can't understand it,
how is he going to?

29:12.126 --> 29:15.885
The one thing that helped me when I
was trying to understand my problem

29:15.886 --> 29:18.645
was talking to people
in the same position.

29:18.646 --> 29:21.445
Might help you, too,
if we can find someone.

29:21.446 --> 29:23.645
I don't know if I could.

29:23.646 --> 29:26.125
I can't bear the thought
of anyone knowing.

29:26.126 --> 29:29.832
Sometimes it is easier to talk to
strangers than our loved ones.

29:30.646 --> 29:32.125
My Paul...

29:32.126 --> 29:33.926
...he doesn't deserve this.

29:34.926 --> 29:36.645
We're saving up.

29:36.646 --> 29:38.525
We had it all mapped out.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.366
Children... everything.

29:41.366 --> 29:43.126
He's a lovely man.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.125
I've let him down.

29:46.126 --> 29:48.005
Lois...

29:48.006 --> 29:50.645
You haven't done anything wrong.

29:50.646 --> 29:54.446
It's the way that you were born
and none of us can control that.

29:55.886 --> 29:57.645
What about your mum?

29:57.646 --> 30:00.365
Would you like me to talk to her
with you?

30:00.366 --> 30:02.125
I can't.

30:02.126 --> 30:04.125
I just can't.

30:04.126 --> 30:06.125
All right, sweetie.

30:06.126 --> 30:07.646
All right.

30:08.926 --> 30:11.886
Sister, can I ask you something?

30:12.886 --> 30:16.365
You can ask, but I can't promise
to have the answer.

30:16.366 --> 30:19.765
It's not about me or the baby,

30:19.766 --> 30:21.366
it's George.

30:23.766 --> 30:26.645
It's been so hard for him,
these past few months.

30:26.646 --> 30:29.366
I've been a bit wrapped up
in myself.

30:30.366 --> 30:33.125
And we haven't had... you know,

30:33.126 --> 30:34.645
for months.

30:34.646 --> 30:36.805
In case.

30:36.806 --> 30:38.865
And he's been very good about it...

30:40.126 --> 30:42.645
...but now he's acting all strange.

30:42.646 --> 30:45.325
He's hiding something, I know it.

30:45.326 --> 30:47.485
And I think he's having an affair

30:47.486 --> 30:50.005
with the woman from the cafe
near his work.

30:50.006 --> 30:51.765
Whatever makes you think that?

30:51.766 --> 30:54.925
He's developed a taste for bacon
and he's never liked it

30:54.926 --> 30:56.645
and he's getting a bit fat.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.765
That's hardly conclusive proof
of an extra-marital dalliance.

31:00.766 --> 31:03.645
And now you need
to concentrate on baby.

31:03.646 --> 31:06.285
You and Mr Sharp can have
a thorough tete-a-tete

31:06.286 --> 31:08.366
once baby's here and safe.

31:15.246 --> 31:16.806
Nurse, can I borrow you?

31:18.286 --> 31:21.125
I promised Nurse Crane
I'd get this done by tomorrow.

31:21.126 --> 31:23.885
I just need a bit of help
to turn the engine over.

31:23.886 --> 31:25.646
It'll only take a minute.

31:26.646 --> 31:28.646
As long as it's quick.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.645
Right, when I say, put one foot
on the pedal on the left

31:40.646 --> 31:42.646
and one on the pedal on the right.

31:44.366 --> 31:46.885
Do you want me to do anything
with the gear stick?

31:46.886 --> 31:48.605
No, no. Just turn the key.

31:53.446 --> 31:55.046
You've done it!

31:56.046 --> 31:58.125
Yeah, gently. Not too much.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.886
Argh!

32:03.606 --> 32:06.365
It's nothing.
It's just a slight burn.

32:06.366 --> 32:08.526
I wasn't concentrating.

32:12.126 --> 32:13.646
Thank you.

32:14.646 --> 32:17.125
I don't usually injure myself.

32:17.126 --> 32:18.966
Mind on other things.

32:19.966 --> 32:21.645
It happens.

32:21.646 --> 32:23.645
Where are you from?

32:23.646 --> 32:25.646
I came over from British Guiana.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.885
Sister Monica Joan tells me
you are mechanic by day

32:29.886 --> 32:31.645
and a scholar by night.

32:31.646 --> 32:33.645
Of Civil Engineering?

32:33.646 --> 32:35.965
They're not that different
from each other.

32:35.966 --> 32:38.405
They're both about putting
things together.

32:38.406 --> 32:40.885
Or fixing them when they break down.

32:40.886 --> 32:42.606
I fix things.

32:43.606 --> 32:45.246
And you fix people.

32:53.366 --> 32:55.646
Do you like to dance,
Nurse Anderson?

32:56.646 --> 32:58.885
Of course. Who doesn't?

32:58.886 --> 33:02.645
Would you like to come dancing
with me one Saturday night?

33:02.646 --> 33:05.085
I'm a member of a very good
social club.

33:05.086 --> 33:08.126
I am very flattered,
but I'm going to decline.

33:09.126 --> 33:11.045
I am here to work, Cyril,

33:11.046 --> 33:13.646
and I cannot allow myself
to get distracted.

33:14.766 --> 33:16.645
I understand.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.326
Completely.

33:25.366 --> 33:27.646
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

33:28.646 --> 33:30.645
Hello. It's George Sharp here.

33:30.646 --> 33:32.885
It's my wife, Pam.
I think she's started.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.886
Come quickly, won't you?

33:46.366 --> 33:47.886
Nurse Anderson...

33:49.126 --> 33:53.645
...from the first moment I
encountered you, I sensed a spirit.

33:53.646 --> 33:55.125
Free.

33:55.126 --> 33:56.885
Fearless.

33:56.886 --> 34:01.365
It would pain me to think your time
spent within these hallowed walls

34:01.366 --> 34:03.806
had rendered you earthbound.

34:04.806 --> 34:06.885
You were listening, Sister.

34:06.886 --> 34:11.125
I was in the vicinity
and words floated to my ears.

34:11.126 --> 34:12.646
Ooh!

34:14.646 --> 34:18.366
I promised to bring
that nice young man a cup of tea.

34:21.886 --> 34:23.886
But I suddenly feel weary.

34:25.886 --> 34:27.324
I must rest.

34:27.326 --> 34:30.646
Perhaps you... could oblige?

34:39.646 --> 34:41.366
Thank you!

34:46.886 --> 34:50.284
Sister Monica Joan asked me
to bring you this.

34:50.286 --> 34:51.646
Thanks.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.525
No music?

34:56.525 --> 34:58.366
I was thinking of you.

35:00.886 --> 35:02.886
It is your last night.

35:08.646 --> 35:10.645
♪ You're my Miss Jamaica... ♪

35:10.646 --> 35:13.294
There's always music
in the streets back home.

35:14.126 --> 35:16.245
I'd forgotten that till you came.

35:16.246 --> 35:19.125
Well, if you won't come dancing
with me to a club,

35:19.126 --> 35:20.886
dance with me now.

35:22.366 --> 35:23.725
What, here?

35:23.726 --> 35:25.126
Yes, here.

35:40.126 --> 35:42.766
I... I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.646
♪ I'm crowning you myself

35:47.646 --> 35:50.645
♪ Cos you're my Miss Jamaica

35:50.646 --> 35:52.645
♪ Miss Jamaica

35:52.646 --> 35:54.886
♪ Miss Jamaica... ♪

35:56.366 --> 35:58.005
The cavalry's arrived.

35:58.006 --> 36:01.085
Your wife's in the bedroom, yes?

36:01.086 --> 36:03.126
That answers my question.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.445
Why don't you pop the kettle on,
Mr Sharp,

36:09.446 --> 36:11.525
and make yourself a nice
cup of tea?

36:11.526 --> 36:13.885
- Argh!
- Are you feeling all right, Mr Sharp?

36:13.886 --> 36:16.645
I'm fine... I'm fine.
It just comes over me.

36:16.646 --> 36:18.645
Sister Hilda, is that you?

36:18.646 --> 36:20.645
I think I'm dying.

36:20.646 --> 36:24.365
Yes, Mrs Sharp, it's me,
and you sound fairly alive to me.

36:24.366 --> 36:26.646
You go. I'll be there in a minute.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.365
It's... it's gone now.

36:29.366 --> 36:32.125
So I see.
How often does this happen?

36:32.126 --> 36:34.006
About every five minutes.

36:39.886 --> 36:41.645
I don't understand, Lois.

36:41.646 --> 36:42.965
Why? Why?

36:42.966 --> 36:44.565
What's happened? Why?

36:44.566 --> 36:46.205
Why?

36:46.206 --> 36:49.325
Because I don't have those feelings
for you any more.

36:49.326 --> 36:51.125
And it's not fair.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.685
No, no, this isn't you, Lois.
This isn't like you.

36:53.686 --> 36:56.085
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

36:56.086 --> 36:58.325
I don't believe you.

36:58.326 --> 37:00.365
Find somebody else, Paul.

37:00.366 --> 37:02.646
Somebody that can make you happy.

37:03.646 --> 37:05.166
Because I can't.

37:11.126 --> 37:12.965
I don't want it.

37:12.966 --> 37:15.645
What am I supposed to do with that?
It's yours.

37:15.646 --> 37:18.166
It will only ever be yours.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.405
I want it to be over.
Please let it be over.

37:36.406 --> 37:39.365
It will be.
Baby can't stay in there for ever.

37:39.366 --> 37:42.925
- Now, do you prefer Pam or Pamela?
- Pam.

37:42.926 --> 37:44.885
I hate Pamela.

37:44.886 --> 37:47.645
My little brother used to call me
Spamela.

37:47.646 --> 37:50.125
Sister, is my George all right?

37:50.126 --> 37:51.645
That's it, Pam.

37:51.646 --> 37:54.165
Breathe with the contraction.

37:54.166 --> 37:57.125
Let it wash over you.
That's it, darling.

37:57.126 --> 37:59.085
Good girl.

37:59.086 --> 38:01.405
Argh... Arrgh!

38:01.406 --> 38:03.645
Don't you worry, Pam.

38:03.646 --> 38:06.445
Concentrate on what you have to do.

38:06.446 --> 38:08.645
Contraction's nearly gone.
That's it.

38:08.646 --> 38:10.645
That's it.

38:10.646 --> 38:12.126
Lovely.

38:13.646 --> 38:15.886
What's wrong with George, Sister?

38:19.126 --> 38:22.965
Your pulse is a little fast,
but your temperature's normal.

38:22.966 --> 38:26.125
How are your movements, Mr Sharp?
Any constipation?

38:26.126 --> 38:29.005
I'd just like to feel your stomach,
if I may?

38:34.126 --> 38:38.046
I'll send for the doctor
just to be on the safe side.

39:28.286 --> 39:30.125
I've examined you thoroughly.

39:30.126 --> 39:32.645
I don't think there's anything
seriously wrong.

39:32.646 --> 39:35.045
It's more likely to be
a touch of anxiety.

39:35.046 --> 39:39.646
When my eldest was born, I was
a nervous wreck, and I'm a doctor.

39:40.646 --> 39:43.645
Anxiety? What, it could do
something like this?

39:43.646 --> 39:45.126
Absolutely.

39:47.086 --> 39:48.645
Come on, Pam!

39:48.646 --> 39:50.885
For God's sake, just push, will ya?!

39:50.886 --> 39:53.445
Don't you talk to me like that,
George Sharp!

39:53.446 --> 39:55.366
This is all your bloody fault!

39:56.366 --> 39:57.886
I need a fag.

39:58.886 --> 40:02.885
Aaaaaaarrrrrh!

40:02.886 --> 40:04.726
Ooooh.

40:17.126 --> 40:19.885
Cyril asked me to go dancing
with him.

40:19.886 --> 40:22.126
Good for him. I said no.

40:24.126 --> 40:26.046
I wish I'd said yes now.

40:27.046 --> 40:28.965
Well, it's not too late.

40:28.966 --> 40:31.366
You are allowed to change your mind.

40:33.886 --> 40:36.086
I seem to have an admirer too.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.646
And I think I'm being
a bit of a coward.

40:41.646 --> 40:44.646
I shall have to face the music,
as should you.

40:46.366 --> 40:47.886
Goodnight.

40:57.366 --> 41:00.661
Short breaths for me, darling.
That's it, little breaths.

41:01.686 --> 41:03.805
Pant for me, darling.

41:03.806 --> 41:05.125
That's it.

41:05.126 --> 41:07.125
You're doing beautifully, Pam.

41:07.126 --> 41:10.286
- Baby's almost with you.
- Here comes baby.

41:11.286 --> 41:12.725
Big push.

41:12.726 --> 41:14.646
Aaaargh!

41:15.646 --> 41:18.005
Look at you, little beauty.

41:24.126 --> 41:28.726
Well done. You have a perfect
daughter, Pam. You've done so well.

41:31.366 --> 41:32.886
There, there.

41:33.886 --> 41:35.606
There you are.

41:48.926 --> 41:51.166
Hello, darling.

41:52.646 --> 41:54.646
Thank God that's over.

42:08.646 --> 42:11.366
You all right, love?
You're very quiet.

42:12.366 --> 42:13.886
Lois, what's...

42:14.886 --> 42:16.646
What have you done?

42:18.886 --> 42:20.885
Why did you do this?

42:20.886 --> 42:22.366
Why?

42:23.366 --> 42:25.805
Your lovely, lovely dress. Why?

42:25.806 --> 42:27.645
Lois?

42:27.646 --> 42:31.470
Lois, your poor father, he would
turn in his grave if he saw this.

42:32.366 --> 42:34.885
What are you going
to get married in now?

42:34.886 --> 42:36.645
The wedding's off.

42:36.646 --> 42:39.882
- What do you mean, it's off?
- It's not happening, Mum.

42:40.406 --> 42:42.885
Did he break it off?
If he has, I'll kill him!

42:42.886 --> 42:44.366
He didn't.

42:47.646 --> 42:49.366
I did.

42:54.286 --> 42:56.645
Don't you want to know
what we've had?

42:56.646 --> 42:59.405
I don't care. Just glad it's here.

42:59.406 --> 43:01.366
She, George.

43:02.526 --> 43:04.366
You've got a daughter.

43:07.366 --> 43:09.885
Tell you what, you women
don't half go through it.

43:09.886 --> 43:12.246
I'll never moan about a cold
ever again.

43:33.886 --> 43:35.925
Good evening and welcome.

43:35.926 --> 43:38.645
Even at this late hour.

43:38.646 --> 43:41.245
How may I be of assistance?

43:41.246 --> 43:43.885
Assistance?!
You've got a damn cheek!

43:43.886 --> 43:46.645
You and your assistance has
ruined my daughter's life.

43:46.646 --> 43:48.283
Do you know that? Do you?

43:48.284 --> 43:49.645
I... I... I think that you...

43:49.646 --> 43:52.645
If you had done your job properly
when you were meant to,

43:52.646 --> 43:55.325
she would not be like this now.
This is all your fault.

43:55.326 --> 43:58.125
- What's wrong? What's happening?
- I'm confused.

43:58.126 --> 44:00.125
- May I ask...
- I'm glad you're here.

44:00.126 --> 44:02.365
You need to know what
she's done to my girl.

44:02.366 --> 44:04.645
May I ask you to refrain
from speaking to

44:04.646 --> 44:06.885
or about Sister Monica Joan
in this way?

44:06.886 --> 44:10.886
She is a senior midwife and deserves
your respect, not your anger.

44:29.886 --> 44:31.885
Please sit down, Mrs Parry.

44:31.886 --> 44:34.325
I know she's old,
but she wasn't old then.

44:34.326 --> 44:37.285
She should've known there was
something wrong with my Lois

44:37.286 --> 44:38.725
when she was born.

44:38.726 --> 44:41.885
She was my midwife.
It was her job to know.

44:41.886 --> 44:44.125
She told me she was a girl.

44:44.126 --> 44:46.365
She's got boy's bits...

44:46.366 --> 44:47.886
...inside.

44:50.646 --> 44:53.646
I had heard something of this
from Nurse Franklin.

44:54.886 --> 44:56.646
I understand how...

44:57.646 --> 45:00.325
...deeply upsetting this must be.

45:00.326 --> 45:02.646
And a terrible shock for all of you.

45:03.646 --> 45:05.646
Please, come and sit down.

45:06.886 --> 45:10.645
I don't have the details of your
daughter's case, Mrs Parry.

45:10.646 --> 45:14.886
From what I understand,
Lois outwardly looks female.

45:16.646 --> 45:19.365
She would've appeared
to be a normal...

45:19.366 --> 45:21.365
...baby girl when she was born

45:21.366 --> 45:24.645
and Sister Monica Joan would have
had no reason to think otherwise.

45:24.646 --> 45:26.365
Well, she isn't now.

45:26.366 --> 45:27.886
Not now.

45:28.886 --> 45:31.885
20 years, I've watched
my little girl grow.

45:31.886 --> 45:33.645
20 years.

45:33.646 --> 45:36.885
Then, today, because of some
bloody test, everything's changed.

45:36.886 --> 45:40.646
Lois hasn't.
She's still the same person she was.

45:41.646 --> 45:43.206
I'm her mother.

45:44.206 --> 45:46.086
How did I not know?

45:47.086 --> 45:49.645
All those... years.

45:49.646 --> 45:53.365
If I'd had a notion,
I could've prepared myself better.

45:53.366 --> 45:56.126
How is she ever going
to get over this?

45:59.126 --> 46:01.645
Don't chide yourself, Mrs Parry.

46:01.646 --> 46:05.125
Lois will come to understand
that you and her sister

46:05.126 --> 46:08.126
and others will love her
for who she is.

46:10.366 --> 46:12.645
You will be her strength,

46:12.646 --> 46:15.646
as you have been since
the day she was born.

46:21.886 --> 46:23.366
Lois.

46:25.926 --> 46:27.646
Lois.

46:28.646 --> 46:30.125
Lois.

46:30.126 --> 46:31.365
Mum.

46:31.366 --> 46:32.886
Mum!

46:34.126 --> 46:35.886
What's wrong with her?

46:36.966 --> 46:40.486
Go and phone an ambulance.
Hurry! Hurry!

46:45.366 --> 46:46.886
I'm sorry.

46:47.886 --> 46:49.886
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:29.846 --> 47:32.125
Just when I think
one job's finished,

47:32.126 --> 47:35.715
- lo and behold, there's another.
- That's fatherhood, George.

47:36.406 --> 47:38.645
So, are you feeling better now?

47:38.646 --> 47:40.646
Yeah. All the pain's gone.

47:41.646 --> 47:43.365
What was that all about?

47:43.366 --> 47:46.645
I think it was all about grief
over your first baby

47:46.646 --> 47:48.925
and anxiety about the new one.

47:48.926 --> 47:53.685
Emotional distress expressing itself
through physical symptoms.

47:53.686 --> 47:56.125
So you're saying it was all
in my head?

47:56.126 --> 47:59.645
- All that pain and massive stomach?
- It was all very real to you.

47:59.646 --> 48:02.646
It's a condition known
as Couvade, George.

48:03.646 --> 48:06.646
In layman's terms,
you had a phantom pregnancy.

48:07.646 --> 48:11.405
You experienced all the symptoms
of pregnancy along with your wife.

48:11.406 --> 48:14.125
- I felt like I was going mad.
- No.

48:14.126 --> 48:17.646
You just have a very, very close
bond with your wife.

48:20.126 --> 48:24.009
The only phantom pregnancy I ever
heard of was in a cocker spaniel.

48:27.366 --> 48:28.646
Yeah?

48:33.886 --> 48:36.885
I just couldn't face the thought
of telling another soul.

48:36.886 --> 48:40.846
Your mother was in shock, Lois.
She didn't mean to react like that.

48:41.846 --> 48:45.645
I wish everything was the same
as it was,

48:45.646 --> 48:48.005
but I know it can't be now.

48:48.006 --> 48:50.125
Everything's different.

48:50.126 --> 48:52.365
I'm not the same me any more.

48:52.366 --> 48:55.645
You're still the same kind,
lovely person,

48:55.646 --> 48:58.205
with a family and fiance
who love you very much.

48:58.206 --> 49:00.006
That hasn't changed.

49:01.006 --> 49:03.645
Our bodies are only part
of who we are.

49:03.646 --> 49:05.886
I want to understand mine now.

49:07.646 --> 49:09.365
When you feel stronger,

49:09.366 --> 49:12.645
we can make you an appointment
at the Women's Advice Clinic.

49:12.646 --> 49:14.850
They'll try to help
you find a way ahead.

49:14.851 --> 49:16.362
Will you be there?

49:16.966 --> 49:18.486
I'll try.

49:21.886 --> 49:24.366
Hello. Is that Cyril?

49:25.886 --> 49:27.486
It's Lucille.

49:31.366 --> 49:35.285
If you do this work at
the Women's Advice Clinic,

49:35.286 --> 49:37.365
it will have to be in your own time,

49:37.366 --> 49:40.125
as work on the district
continues to grow.

49:40.126 --> 49:41.885
I know that, Sister,

49:41.886 --> 49:45.365
but I want to work in a place
where women feel able to come

49:45.366 --> 49:49.365
and ask for help without feeling
embarrassed or uncomfortable.

49:49.366 --> 49:52.125
Where they can talk in confidence
to other women

49:52.126 --> 49:55.645
who are sympathetic and understand
some of what they're going through.

49:55.646 --> 49:57.646
Then you have my permission.

50:13.486 --> 50:15.646
Why don't you go talk to him, love?

50:16.646 --> 50:18.646
He's been out there every day.

50:19.646 --> 50:20.966
Waiting.

50:40.646 --> 50:42.366
You rest now.

50:46.366 --> 50:50.366
They said I don't have to tell
anyone anything if I don't want to.

50:52.406 --> 50:55.125
- I'm sorry, Mum.
- Don't you dare say that.

50:55.126 --> 50:57.645
You've got nothing to be sorry for,
hear me?

50:57.646 --> 50:59.885
But you've lost all that money.

50:59.886 --> 51:03.125
The church hall let me off
everything except the deposit.

51:03.126 --> 51:05.125
Anyway, none of it matters.

51:05.126 --> 51:06.645
None of it.

51:06.646 --> 51:10.365
All I care about is you
and how you feel.

51:10.366 --> 51:11.965
That's all.

51:11.966 --> 51:14.646
So don't you worry,
we'll muddle through.

51:15.646 --> 51:17.246
We'll do it together.

51:18.366 --> 51:21.155
Has Paul really been
waiting out there?

51:21.157 --> 51:22.085
He has.

51:22.086 --> 51:24.366
He cares about you, Lois.

51:27.366 --> 51:30.365
Come and keep your sister company
while I sort the tea.

51:30.366 --> 51:33.896
- I'm not going to do anything, Mum.
- I didn't say you were.

51:53.126 --> 51:56.365
Don't you think my hair's a bit big?
Deanna from the choir did it

51:56.366 --> 51:58.885
and I didn't have the heart
to say I wasn't sure.

51:58.886 --> 52:02.063
The bigger the better.
Deanna's done a magnificent job.

52:04.126 --> 52:06.645
Maybe I should've bought
a new dress.

52:06.646 --> 52:10.365
- I've had this one for ages.
- Nonsense. That one suits you.

52:10.366 --> 52:13.365
And the colour's divine.
There's nothing worse than wearing

52:13.366 --> 52:16.125
something all stiff and new
that doesn't feel like you.

52:16.126 --> 52:18.486
Stand up and do a twirl.

52:23.646 --> 52:24.965
Beautiful.

52:24.966 --> 52:27.885
You look... exactly like you.

52:27.886 --> 52:29.966
Just with bigger hair.

52:51.646 --> 52:54.705
Mum says you've been standing
out here, just waiting.

52:55.566 --> 52:57.646
I wanted to see you.

52:58.646 --> 53:00.125
Good.

53:00.126 --> 53:02.646
Because I've got something
I have to say.

53:31.846 --> 53:35.486
I just fixed it up. You're
the first person to ride in it.

53:38.126 --> 53:40.846
I've known for years
that things weren't right.

53:42.886 --> 53:44.766
But you never said anything.

53:45.766 --> 53:47.206
To you?

53:48.166 --> 53:50.645
I never said anything to anyone.

53:50.646 --> 53:53.525
And there's things we never
discussed with each other,

53:53.526 --> 53:55.866
like what would have happened
on our wedding night.

53:55.867 --> 53:56.645
No.

53:56.646 --> 54:00.645
I supposed I just thought
I'd wait and see what happened.

54:00.646 --> 54:02.126
Yeah.

54:05.646 --> 54:08.365
You know, I wondered and wondered,
Lois,

54:08.366 --> 54:10.565
what it would be like.

54:10.566 --> 54:12.646
What we'd be like.

54:15.126 --> 54:17.125
And it was brilliant...

54:17.126 --> 54:18.646
...in my mind.

54:19.646 --> 54:22.446
Even though I didn't actually
know anything.

54:24.446 --> 54:26.126
I wondered too.

54:27.126 --> 54:29.126
Until I found things out.

54:30.646 --> 54:32.126
I'm sorry.

54:33.126 --> 54:34.646
I'm sorry.

54:35.646 --> 54:37.366
For you, for us.

54:38.366 --> 54:40.955
But I wouldn't be
if I didn't still love you.

54:41.886 --> 54:46.125
If I didn't look at you and feel
everything that I felt

54:46.126 --> 54:48.485
before you told me... and more.

54:48.486 --> 54:50.125
More?

54:50.126 --> 54:52.125
I love you, Lois.

54:52.126 --> 54:57.125
I look at you and everything I see
is what I saw the day I met you.

54:57.126 --> 54:59.285
It's exactly what I've been
looking at

54:59.286 --> 55:01.725
all the time we've been planning
this wedding.

55:01.726 --> 55:05.045
There are things that are never
going to happen for us, Paul.

55:05.046 --> 55:07.126
You do understand that?

55:08.126 --> 55:10.645
We're never going to have children,
for a start.

55:10.646 --> 55:13.176
I'm not getting married
cos I want children.

55:14.126 --> 55:16.445
I'm getting married
because I want you.

55:16.446 --> 55:18.165
Still?

55:18.166 --> 55:19.886
Always.

55:23.126 --> 55:26.645
You know, I used to think that
we were made for each other,

55:26.646 --> 55:29.125
so if you're not made like...

55:29.126 --> 55:31.485
...like other people,

55:31.486 --> 55:34.565
that just makes you more precious
to me.

55:34.566 --> 55:36.325
Will we find a way?

55:36.326 --> 55:38.726
We're already looking.

55:47.166 --> 55:50.125
- How do I get in?
- Just climb in.

55:50.126 --> 55:51.806
There's nothing to it.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.646
Come on, let's go.

56:00.646 --> 56:02.886
- Foot on the step.
- Thank you.

56:06.886 --> 56:09.365
Perhaps, most of all,

56:09.366 --> 56:11.885
we are what we accept.

56:11.886 --> 56:14.125
What we allow to be important.

56:14.126 --> 56:18.366
What we embrace about each other
and ourselves?

56:19.366 --> 56:21.365
There's nothing better.

56:21.366 --> 56:23.846
There is nothing more hopeful.

56:24.846 --> 56:26.646
There is nothing else.
