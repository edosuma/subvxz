01:09.903 --> 01:11.371
<i>Fifty years ago,</i>

01:11.655 --> 01:14.784
<i>an alien force known
as the Formics attacked Earth.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:17.123
<i>Tens of millions died.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:20.414
<i>It was only through the sacrifice</i>

01:20.497 --> 01:21.714
<i>of our greatest commander</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:24.673
<i>that we avoided total annihilation.</i>

01:38.140 --> 01:41.235
<i>We've been preparing for them
to come back ever since.</i>

01:42.477 --> 01:44.400
<i>The International Fleet decided</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.114
<i>that the world's smartest children</i>

01:46.189 --> 01:48.032
<i>are the planet's best hope.</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:49.993
<i>Raised on war games,</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:54.414
<i>their decisions are intuitive,
decisive, fearless.</i>

01:54.906 --> 01:56.704
<i>I am one of those recruits.</i>

01:56.867 --> 01:59.211
No, I got him.
He's poking his head out.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.038
<i>I've watched through his eyes,</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:03.874
I've listened through his ears,

02:04.249 --> 02:05.842
and I tell you

02:06.710 --> 02:07.836
he's the one.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.217
That's what you said
about his brother.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.346
Brother tested out impossible
for other reasons.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.894
Nothing to do with his
tactical abilities.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.645
- I gotcha, I gotcha...
- Go around.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.232
He's gonna crush him.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.107
Come on!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.401
You can't do that!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.066
You've got to use
what's around you.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.779
No, no, no. I had you all
the way through the belt!

02:31.026 --> 02:32.347
You miscalculated your trajectory

02:32.402 --> 02:34.029
relative to the incoming asteroid.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.080
Don't lecture me, Wiggin!

02:36.198 --> 02:37.245
You cheated!

02:38.784 --> 02:40.377
It was a good game.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.454
Thanks.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.466
Hey!

02:52.756 --> 02:54.133
<i>Play again.</i>

02:54.633 --> 02:55.634
<i>Sorry.</i>

02:56.385 --> 02:58.228
<i>- Tomorrow maybe?</i>
- You see?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.351
He's got a talent for strategy.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.649
His humility could be false.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.110
Part of a strategy to
avoid antagonizing

03:05.227 --> 03:06.319
an ego-driven opponent.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.276
Which makes him even smarter.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.530
He may be a genius,

03:09.606 --> 03:11.779
but we need someone the
others will follow. A leader.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.785
<i>He can't win on his own.</i>

03:13.985 --> 03:16.613
<i>Well, let's see how
he handles rejection.</i>

03:17.322 --> 03:18.995
Andrew Wiggin.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.868
<i>Andrew Ender Wiggin,</i>

03:20.951 --> 03:22.874
<i>please report to the Infirmary.</i>

03:22.953 --> 03:24.955
<i>Ender Wiggin, to the infirmary.</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:35.636
- Hello, Ender.
- Hello.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.935
That nasty monitor
is coming out today.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.978
Please. Lie face down.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.480
Am I off the program?

03:44.266 --> 03:45.518
Did I do something wrong?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.360
That's not really for me to say.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.611
Lie down.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.499
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner you can move on.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.467
Ready?

04:14.546 --> 04:15.798
This won't hurt a bit.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.696
A-ten-hut!

04:36.401 --> 04:37.698
Forward march!

04:49.414 --> 04:50.882
Where do you think
you're going, Wiggin?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.544
Washed out, huh?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.263
Come on!

04:57.756 --> 04:59.349
- Get him in there!
- You're expecting...

04:59.424 --> 05:00.596
Come on!

05:05.055 --> 05:06.056
Come on, cheat.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.558
One on one, for real this time.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.726
No game.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.019
He's got no monitor now.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.103
That's right.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.235
No one watching you now, Wiggin.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.071
One on one?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.236
Then why are your boys holding me?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.413
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.720
Stay down...

05:37.921 --> 05:39.441
I'm gonna kill you, cheat.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.595
Goddamn...

05:43.760 --> 05:44.932
Take it easy, Ender!

05:50.934 --> 05:53.232
You might be thinking
of ganging up on me.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.440
But just remember what I do
to people who try to hurt me.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.123
He said I was cheating.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.299
Said that was why I
was off the program,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.739
- and I kept on kicking him.
- It doesn't matter.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.966
Even after he was down.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.634
He'll never bully you again.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.174
All I could think was,

06:23.133 --> 06:24.476
"What would Peter do?"

06:27.679 --> 06:28.851
I'm just like him, Val.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.642
No. No, you are nothing
like him, Ender.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.185
Nothing like who?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.644
I thought you had a game?

06:34.978 --> 06:35.945
Rained out.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.115
- What's he crying about?
- I'm not crying.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.154
My monitor's gone.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.818
Now I'm just like you.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.153
You mean that Mom and Dad spent

06:43.278 --> 06:44.530
all that money on a third,

06:44.654 --> 06:45.997
and now he's off the program too?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.333
Stop it, Peter. He made it
farther than either of us.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.492
Hey, dropout.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.170
Remember how to play
Formics and Astronauts?

06:52.329 --> 06:53.831
That's it! Where's Mom?

06:54.497 --> 06:55.714
No, don't.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.605
- I'll play.
- Put the mask on.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.713
You can be the bug.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.137
Peter! You're insane!

07:04.299 --> 07:06.301
- Stay out of this, Valentine!
- No! Stop it!

07:06.509 --> 07:08.136
Alright, bug, you
started it, you attack first.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.220
Peter! Let me in!

07:09.346 --> 07:10.347
Come on!

07:13.350 --> 07:14.727
Come on, fight back!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.340
At last we got one of you alive!

07:16.353 --> 07:18.026
Peter! Stop it!

07:18.855 --> 07:20.857
You know, I could kill you,
just like this.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.702
Peter... Please...

07:25.570 --> 07:26.696
I should have been chosen.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.588
<i>Deep space Intel shows us</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:42.337
<i>that the number of enemy ships
already deployed</i>

07:42.545 --> 07:45.890
<i>is 10 times those we faced
during the first invasion.</i>

07:46.049 --> 07:48.723
<i>The Formics are rebuilding
and strengthening their fleet.</i>

07:48.885 --> 07:51.104
<i>We must conquer or die.</i>

07:51.346 --> 07:52.723
Turn it off, please, John.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.899
Why? You'd rather not know
what's going on in the world?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.380
<i>We must never again bear witness</i>

07:56.434 --> 07:59.859
<i>to the slaughter of tens of
millions of innocent people,</i>

07:59.938 --> 08:01.736
<i>as we did during the
Formic invasion.</i>

08:01.898 --> 08:03.866
I'd rather you talk to your son.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.865
<i>Our survival demands
total commitment</i>

08:05.944 --> 08:07.742
<i>to the destruction of the enemy.</i>

08:08.738 --> 08:10.206
If you want, I'll go away,

08:10.407 --> 08:12.250
so you don't have
to be embarrassed.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.753
Ender, no one is embarrassed.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.377
I'm a third. I should
never have been born.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.756
No. We wanted you, Ender.
We just needed permission.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.300
John, please say something.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.142
It's a tough program, Ender.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.895
When they brought
me to this country,

08:36.975 --> 08:39.602
there was less competition.
And still, I didn't make it.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.613
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.446
Nothing.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.745
<i>Sensor alert.</i>

08:48.820 --> 08:51.289
<i>Front door. Please state your name.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:52.532
<i>Colonel Hyrum Graff,</i>

08:52.615 --> 08:54.413
<i>Director of Training,
International Fleet.</i>

08:54.492 --> 08:56.745
<i>This is my colleague,
Major Anderson.</i>

08:57.162 --> 08:58.288
<i>May we?</i>

08:58.830 --> 09:00.207
Why'd you keep kicking him?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.633
You'd already won the fight.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.634
- Did you enjoy it?
- No.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.505
Then why? Speak up, son.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.634
Knocking him down was
the first fight.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.646
I wanted to win all
the next ones too.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.775
So they'd leave me alone.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.855
Ender, you should have asked
a grownup for help.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.937
Nonsense.
He can fight his own battles.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.610
Colonel, he was
obviously being bullied

09:24.689 --> 09:27.158
- and he defended himself.
- Son...

09:28.318 --> 09:30.696
I'd like to offer you a
place in our program.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.338
But you took away my monitor.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.252
The final step in our evaluation

09:42.332 --> 09:44.801
is always to see what happens
when the monitor's removed.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.218
And he passed?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.134
He put a child in the hospital.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.459
It's not what he did.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.175
It's why he did it. It was tactical.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.353
A strategy to stop future attacks.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.856
Ender, you don't have to do this.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.897
Ender and I should have
a private conversation.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.520
- Absolutely not!
- With all respect, sir,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.814
you really can't stop me.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.028
The Formics might have wiped us out

10:11.152 --> 10:12.529
the last time, you know.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.368
A brilliant commander is
the only thing that saved us.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.374
Mazer Rackham...

10:20.912 --> 10:22.414
Mazer Rackham.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.549
We need minds like yours, Ender.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.429
Young people integrate complex
data more easily than adults.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.846
Will the monitor be reinstalled?

10:34.384 --> 10:35.556
No.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.599
You're graduating.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.848
To Battle School.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.689
Privacy rights restored.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.232
If there is a chance that,
because of you,

10:48.731 --> 10:51.610
the Formics might leave
us alone forever,

10:53.862 --> 10:56.115
then I have to ask
you to come with me.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.757
It's what I was born for, right?

11:09.377 --> 11:10.924
<i>Valentine was too compassionate</i>

11:11.045 --> 11:12.763
<i>for Battle School.</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:20.897
<i>My brother Peter washed out</i>

11:20.972 --> 11:22.974
<i>because he was too
quick to violence.</i>

11:24.142 --> 11:26.019
<i>Colonel Graff said I
need to find a balance</i>

11:26.102 --> 11:28.901
<i>between those emotions if I
were to succeed.</i>

11:35.987 --> 11:37.284
Join the others.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.616
Go on.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.265
- You're late.
- Out of my control.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.641
I'm Ender.

12:01.846 --> 12:02.847
Ender?

12:03.473 --> 12:05.316
What kind of name is that?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.106
What's your name?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.487
Name's Bean.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.027
Bean?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.485
Grew up on the streets.
Not worth a bean.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.029
<i>T-minus
10 seconds and counting.</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:27.709
<i>T-minus five seconds and counting.</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:32.836
<i>Four, three, two, one...</i>

12:57.485 --> 12:58.907
- Wow...
- Oh...

12:59.237 --> 13:00.659
Oh, my gosh!

13:06.411 --> 13:07.503
I'm gonna be...

13:07.578 --> 13:09.251
A bag! Give him the bag!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.345
Whoa!

13:15.670 --> 13:17.672
Oh!

13:19.048 --> 13:21.016
Are you serious, man?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.598
Close the bag!

13:26.431 --> 13:27.432
You all right?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.100
Mmm.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.400
What are you doin', Wiggin?

13:33.521 --> 13:34.568
Nothing, sir.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.115
Something funny?

13:36.858 --> 13:38.576
I asked you a question, Launchie!

13:40.069 --> 13:41.946
Sir, the way you're floating.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.791
Horizontal.
I thought that was funny.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.576
Really? Why?

13:47.285 --> 13:50.255
Because in zero gravity
there is no right side up.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.632
You may think you're vertical
and we may be horizontal.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.339
Is that funny?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.635
Sir, no, sir!

13:57.754 --> 13:59.051
Yes, it is.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.924
Alai, do you know what
he's talkin' about?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.135
- Yes, sir.
- No, you don't.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.305
There's only one kid on this launch

14:07.430 --> 14:09.478
with any brains at all so far.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.610
And that's Ender Wiggin.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.770
All new arrivals

14:51.849 --> 14:53.977
<i>follow the yellow lights
to your accommodations.</i>

14:54.185 --> 14:55.983
<i>The yellow lights.</i>

15:08.491 --> 15:10.164
Sir, you made them hate me.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.706
I told them you were the best.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.541
We need a Julius Caesar,

15:13.788 --> 15:15.836
- a Napoleon.
- We hope that will be you.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.376
Caesar was assassinated
by the people he trusted.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.674
And Napoleon lost in the end.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.181
Not before he conquered
the known world.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.976
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.358
He has a complicated
response to authority.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.694
He wants to please the
overbearing father figure,

15:36.811 --> 15:39.234
but resents a lack of
reciprocated affection.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.528
His isolation can never be broken.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.743
<i>He must never believe
anyone will help him.</i>

15:46.404 --> 15:49.032
Oh, look!
It's the smartass.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.539
Thanks.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.087
Thought I'd have to ask
to be by the door.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.226
Speak your name.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.848
Ender Wiggin.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.588
Don't freeze your balls, kid.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.902
Attention on deck!

16:21.522 --> 16:22.523
At ease.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.785
Listen up, Launchies!

16:25.902 --> 16:29.452
My name is Sergeant James Dap.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.449
Ask me a legitimate question

16:31.699 --> 16:34.623
and I will give you a direct answer.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.247
But if you are looking for
a shoulder to cry on,

16:37.413 --> 16:38.790
use a pillow!

16:40.041 --> 16:41.884
Do I look like I'm joking, snots?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.753
Sir, no, sir!

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
Good.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
You are to work as a team.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.934
You will all make this
bunk room your home.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.890
You will keep your home clean!

16:52.094 --> 16:54.392
There are separate
showers for both sexes.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.976
If you're found in an area not
designated to your gender,

16:58.226 --> 17:00.604
I will personally neuter you!

17:00.811 --> 17:02.279
Am I clear?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.860
Sir, yes, sir!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.997
Class is in five!
Follow the yellow lights!

17:11.239 --> 17:12.832
Yellow, like your cowardly selves!

17:13.074 --> 17:14.416
Sir, yes, sir!

17:16.117 --> 17:17.961
<i>Welcome to Battle School.</i>

17:18.079 --> 17:21.002
<i>A great responsibility
rests upon each of you.</i>

17:21.249 --> 17:24.252
<i>When the enemy first invaded,
we were not ready.</i>

17:24.460 --> 17:27.259
<i>Millions of innocent
lives were lost.</i>

17:27.588 --> 17:29.807
<i>That must never be
allowed to happen again.</i>

17:30.132 --> 17:32.851
<i>We threw everything we
had at the invaders.</i>

17:33.177 --> 17:35.680
<i>And in the midst of
that decisive battle,</i>

17:37.139 --> 17:39.267
<i>a legendary hero emerged.</i>

17:58.786 --> 18:00.038
<i>Eject! Eject!</i>

18:02.206 --> 18:05.176
<i>Break away now! Hammer 3!</i>

18:05.668 --> 18:07.386
<i>Hammer 2, break left!</i>

18:07.795 --> 18:09.172
<i>Bend at left, 7 o'clock.</i>

18:09.380 --> 18:11.678
<i>Hammer 2 is hit! Hammer 2 critical!</i>

18:12.883 --> 18:14.510
<i>Hammer 1 has been hit!</i>

18:34.864 --> 18:37.367
<i>We will never forget
what the enemy did.</i>

18:37.992 --> 18:39.369
<i>But we defeated them.</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:42.375
<i>And we will do so again.</i>

18:43.748 --> 18:45.546
<i>Let the courage of Mazer Rackham</i>

18:46.334 --> 18:48.052
<i>be your inspiration.</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:52.469
Wakey, wakey, rise and shine!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.058
Put on your Battle Room suits!

18:54.216 --> 18:57.686
That's the padded one with
the helmet and the weapon!

18:57.887 --> 19:01.187
Do not attempt to fire the weapon!
Holster it!

19:01.390 --> 19:03.233
Let's move it, Launchies!

19:03.392 --> 19:05.019
You've got 10 minutes!

19:15.571 --> 19:16.823
At ease.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.245
This is the Battle Room.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.160
In here, the floor has been designed

19:21.243 --> 19:23.837
to create an Earth-like
gravitational pull.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.832
Step through that gate

19:25.915 --> 19:29.089
and you're in a zero-G environment.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.509
Wiggin.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.770
Get up here.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.125
What do I do now, sir?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.376
Go on in.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.485
All right. Now, push off.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.830
Whoa.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.027
Pull yourself. Whoa!

21:25.493 --> 21:27.621
Grab my hand.
No, no! Stop! Stop!

21:28.704 --> 21:29.830
Nicely done!

21:30.873 --> 21:32.393
These guys are still
trying to stay up,

21:32.458 --> 21:33.880
the way they came in.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.548
Like you said in the shuttle,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.346
there is no up or down in space.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.841
But we'll need some way
to orientate in here.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.847
Maybe the enemy's gate is "down."

21:42.718 --> 21:43.810
I like it.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.230
Like they're a bug to be
crushed under our feet.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.644
Exactly.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.897
What do you think this does?

21:55.064 --> 21:56.566
We'll have to find out.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.075
Whoa!

22:06.867 --> 22:08.084
Well, that's harmless.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.046
What do you think it does
when it hits the suit?

22:11.413 --> 22:12.665
Good question.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.674
Shoot me in the leg.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.429
We shoot each other.
Same time.

22:26.929 --> 22:27.930
You ready?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.377
In three...

22:30.432 --> 22:32.526
two, one...

22:35.104 --> 22:37.027
Whoa! My leg's frozen!

22:37.731 --> 22:38.857
Mine too!

22:39.692 --> 22:40.909
I can't bend my knee.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.789
Shoot me in the chest.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.957
Come on! I'm getting away!

22:54.915 --> 22:56.292
This is amazing!

22:56.959 --> 22:58.302
I can't move at all now.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.712
You're out of your mind.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.305
That's enough.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.617
You're flappin' around
like a bunch of drunken ducks!

23:21.817 --> 23:24.070
If you expect to compete
with the other teams at this school,

23:24.153 --> 23:25.655
you've got a lot to learn.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.452
Sergeant, explain the game.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.166
Yes, sir.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.915
You will train to compete
as a team against other teams.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.250
You get one point for
a hit to a limb,

23:37.458 --> 23:38.675
six for a torso hit,

23:38.792 --> 23:40.465
which will immobilize
you completely.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.513
But, if either side gets one cadet

23:43.589 --> 23:45.808
through their enemy's gate unharmed,

23:46.425 --> 23:48.098
that army will win,

23:48.510 --> 23:50.683
regardless of points already scored.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.931
Am I clear?

23:52.348 --> 23:53.816
Sir, yes, sir!

23:54.016 --> 23:56.986
<i>"Dear Valentine...
So this is Battle School.</i>

23:57.186 --> 23:59.439
<i>"Every day, hours of training.</i>

23:59.521 --> 24:02.115
<i>"And far more homework
than we ever had on Earth.</i>

24:02.608 --> 24:04.360
<i>"We train in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

24:05.486 --> 24:08.456
<i>"It keeps us in shape.
And aggressive."</i>

24:08.530 --> 24:09.656
And up!

24:09.823 --> 24:12.042
And one!

24:12.159 --> 24:13.376
Two!

24:13.452 --> 24:14.453
Three!

24:14.536 --> 24:16.789
<i>"I feel Peter in me whenever I fight."</i>

24:17.373 --> 24:19.967
- Wiggin!
<i>- "I wish I didn't.</i>

24:20.042 --> 24:21.339
<i>"We've been studying
Formic flight patterns</i>

24:21.418 --> 24:22.715
<i>"for three months now,</i>

24:22.795 --> 24:24.138
<i>"but they seem entirely random.</i>

24:24.213 --> 24:26.887
<i>"The truth is we really don't
understand our enemy.</i>

24:27.049 --> 24:29.051
<i>"And no one ever adequately explains</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:31.929
<i>"how Mazer Rackham actually
defeated the entire fleet.</i>

24:35.057 --> 24:36.900
<i>"The Colonel said he
expects me to lead.</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:39.986
<i>"But how? What makes a good leader?</i>

24:40.062 --> 24:41.860
<i>"Everyone here is very different.</i>

24:42.356 --> 24:44.654
<i>"So many, many things to learn.</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:46.735
<i>"Always very little sleep.</i>

24:47.069 --> 24:50.073
<i>"Please write back.
I haven 't heard from you.</i>

24:50.739 --> 24:53.162
<i>"How are you?
Is Peter behaving?</i>

24:53.575 --> 24:55.748
<i>"Are you getting my emails?
I miss you..."</i>

24:55.828 --> 24:57.205
Attention on deck!

25:04.586 --> 25:06.839
Evening, Launchies.
At ease.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.101
I'm pleased to see that most
of you are performing well.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.438
As you know, competition for
Command School is tough.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.566
Some in the higher ranks have
failed to meet our standards,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.234
and they're being sent home.

25:19.435 --> 25:24.032
So, I may have the opportunity
to promote some of you.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.232
Look to your left.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.952
Look to your right.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.582
These are not your friends.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.784
They are competition.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.538
Keep up the hard work.

25:38.746 --> 25:39.963
Attention!

25:40.456 --> 25:41.708
Sir?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.051
Is our email being blocked?

25:45.627 --> 25:46.628
It's just that none
of us have received

25:46.712 --> 25:47.804
any replies from home.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.763
All communication is being
temporarily held back.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.843
Why, sir?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.390
Launchie, it is not your place...

25:55.596 --> 25:57.974
Your families will not understand

25:58.057 --> 25:59.309
what we're doing here.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.986
And none of you need the
distraction of their replies.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.685
I thought our privacy rights
had been restored, sir.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.609
You have the right

26:08.817 --> 26:12.287
to privately think whatever
you wish, Wiggin.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.331
But there's too much at stake

26:15.449 --> 26:17.668
to allow your unfiltered thoughts

26:18.077 --> 26:20.171
to leave this facility.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.831
Yes, sir.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.433
Keep it up, snot,

26:33.509 --> 26:35.269
and you will never make it
to Command School.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.687
I thought it was a
legitimate question.

26:36.762 --> 26:37.763
What?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.348
You said if we had a
legitimate question...

26:39.431 --> 26:41.525
Drop and give me 20!

26:51.610 --> 26:53.530
You think you're the smartest
kid in this school?

26:53.695 --> 26:54.696
No, sir.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.958
You will never be a commander!
I will never salute you!

26:58.283 --> 26:59.284
Yes, you will, Sergeant.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.370
Give me 20 more!

27:12.381 --> 27:13.382
Get up!

27:16.510 --> 27:19.389
You do not speak unless spoken to!

27:19.638 --> 27:21.140
Am I clear?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.396
Sir, yes, sir!

27:24.351 --> 27:25.978
Even if I have a
legitimate question?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.734
Shut it, Wiggin!

27:34.903 --> 27:36.405
Now go to sleep!

27:37.114 --> 27:38.411
All of you!

27:51.378 --> 27:52.550
You heard him.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.923
Get some sleep.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.228
We have only three passing scores

28:08.312 --> 28:10.235
on the deep space navigation test.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.820
Alai, Bean and Ender.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.943
- What happened here?
- They probably cheated.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.153
Your mother cheated.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.450
That's why you look like a plumber.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.618
Zip it!

28:18.739 --> 28:19.956
You think this is a game?

28:20.908 --> 28:21.909
No, ma'am.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.629
- We are preparing for war.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.548
Now, the problem was simple.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.467
How do you slingshot your forces

28:31.627 --> 28:34.380
into an attack position on
the blind side of this moon

28:34.463 --> 28:36.264
using the gravitational
pull from this planet?

28:36.465 --> 28:38.308
This is basic rocket
science, people.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.019
Ender, get down here and explain.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.056
Ma'am, I think Bean or Alai

28:44.139 --> 28:45.732
have a better handle
on this than I do.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.111
All right.
Alai, come and explain.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.949
Ma'am, we need
to approach the planet

28:55.025 --> 28:56.527
in the direction it's moving.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.329
That way, we benefit
from its energy of motion.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.948
ls something funny?

29:04.910 --> 29:05.911
Go on, Alai.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.665
Of course, there's
a moon we have to pass here

29:09.873 --> 29:11.341
and that complicates things.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.386
Because the moon's moving in
the opposite direction to us,

29:14.503 --> 29:16.346
we get a gravitational braking.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.174
Who sent this?

29:20.342 --> 29:21.639
Who sent what, Bernard?

29:23.470 --> 29:24.687
Nothing, ma'am.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
Oh.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.153
If you can't take it, Bernard,
don't dish it out.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.525
Yes, ma'am.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.252
<i>Welcome
to Games and Recreation.</i>

30:30.412 --> 30:32.631
<i>Cerebral control enabled.</i>

31:02.319 --> 31:05.118
<i>One is poison. One is not.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:07.787
<i>Choose right and you'll
go to Fairyland.</i>

31:08.492 --> 31:09.789
He's found the Mind Game.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.837
<i>Decide or I'll bite your head off.</i>

31:27.803 --> 31:28.804
<i>Bad luck.</i>

31:30.013 --> 31:31.811
Who authorized his access to this?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.646
- I did.
<i>- Try again, little mouse.</i>

31:33.809 --> 31:34.810
To what end?

31:35.018 --> 31:36.770
Not every battle can be won,
Hyrum.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.901
The way he plays a game
reveals his state of mind.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.903
If you won't let me
assess him one on one,

31:40.982 --> 31:42.780
I need some other way
to know what he's feeling.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.361
I don't care how he's "feeling."

31:45.153 --> 31:47.281
I want him to toughen up
and learn how to lead.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.786
Well, before we make him a leader,

31:48.865 --> 31:51.163
let's see how he deals
with frustration.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.761
Come on!

32:04.840 --> 32:05.966
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

32:06.508 --> 32:07.634
What you doin'?

32:08.385 --> 32:10.012
Playing a stupid game.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.226
No matter what I choose, I die.
It's rigged.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.348
<i>You're back.</i>

32:13.974 --> 32:14.941
<i>One more time.</i>

32:15.016 --> 32:16.142
Can I watch?

32:16.309 --> 32:17.310
Sure.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.690
<i>One is poison. One is not.</i>

32:22.190 --> 32:24.158
<i>Choose right and you'll
go to Fairyland.</i>

32:24.234 --> 32:26.202
- Which you gonna choose?
- Neither.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.997
<i>Come on little mouse, come on.</i>

32:48.091 --> 32:49.343
You killed him.

32:49.926 --> 32:50.927
Why?

32:52.596 --> 32:53.893
That's what they want from us.

32:55.015 --> 32:58.064
Follow the rules, you lose.
Choose violence, you win.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.858
I've never seen anyone do that.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.446
Perfect.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.029
He's perfect.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.161
<i>Ender Wiggin,</i>

33:08.236 --> 33:09.362
<i>you are assigned to Salamander Army,</i>

33:09.446 --> 33:10.572
<i>Commander Bonzo Madrid,</i>

33:10.739 --> 33:13.413
<i>effective immediately.
Orders of Colonel Graft'.</i>

33:13.742 --> 33:16.586
<i>Follow the green lights.
Take nothing with you. Go now.</i>

33:18.914 --> 33:20.257
What are they doing?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.547
They're promoting you.

33:32.761 --> 33:33.762
Ender...

33:35.388 --> 33:36.389
Yeah?

33:42.229 --> 33:43.606
Peace to you.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.824
- Throw!
- Come on!

33:53.949 --> 33:55.109
- Ball...
- Strike two!

33:55.158 --> 33:56.751
- Give me the ball.
- It hit the wall!

33:57.118 --> 33:59.120
- All right. Strike two.
- Play ball!

34:03.833 --> 34:05.460
You lost, Launchie?

34:06.419 --> 34:07.420
I'm Ender Wiggin.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.308
Supposed to report to Bonzo Madrid.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.810
So you're the replacement?

34:14.135 --> 34:16.137
- Ender Wiggin.
- Petra Arkanian.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.393
Only girl in the Salamander Army.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.190
With more balls than anybody
else in this bunkroom.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.686
Ooh! Mama Petra, she talking!

34:24.980 --> 34:25.981
Wiggin?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.275
Sir, yes, sir! Ender Wiggin.
Reassigned.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.994
I ask for a replacement for O'Reilly

34:31.110 --> 34:32.328
and this is what I get?

34:32.487 --> 34:36.161
A useless, skinny, untrained snot!

34:36.283 --> 34:38.001
- I'm a quick study.
- Let me be clear.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.704
I intend to trade you ASAP.

34:41.036 --> 34:44.507
My army is undefeated
in the last 21 battles.

34:44.666 --> 34:48.011
I'm on track to make it to Command
School within six months.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.301
You can get your training
at someone else's expense.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.007
- He's all heart.
- Shut it, Petra!

34:52.132 --> 34:53.179
Easy, Bonzo...

34:53.382 --> 34:54.679
Watch your mouth, Dink.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.514
Here's the deal, snot.
When we go into battle,

34:59.639 --> 35:00.936
you will not pass through the gates

35:01.016 --> 35:02.814
until all my soldiers are through.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.029
Then you will remain
just inside the gate

35:06.187 --> 35:08.485
with your weapon
undrawn and unfired,

35:08.565 --> 35:09.691
until the game ends.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.155
So, lam to do nothing?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.702
You are to keep out of the way.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.076
You bunk at the back of the room.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.018
You know, Bonzo
doesn't like to lose.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.020
He doesn't want an
untrained Launchie

35:39.095 --> 35:40.563
screwing up his perfect maneuvers.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.062
But the Battle Room is open 24/7.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.443
During free time,
I could show you some moves.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.876
You ready?

36:12.128 --> 36:15.052
In three, two, one...

36:54.295 --> 36:55.296
Impressive.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.306
Your turn.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.847
Okay, you can't just keep
your thumb on the trigger.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.606
You need half a second to recharge.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.331
At least you don't
have any bad habits.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.239
I don't have any good ones either.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.403
I'll give you those.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.498
Relax.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.582
The further your target,

37:23.658 --> 37:25.160
the longer you have
to hold the beam.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.252
Fire.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.675
Even longer.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.088
It's the difference between
a tenth and a half-second.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.843
But in battle that's a long time.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.429
Aim, fire, hold, recharge.

37:42.302 --> 37:43.349
That's it.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.573
Learn where your trigger
actually fires,

37:45.597 --> 37:46.849
and ride the edge.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.443
Now you're gettin' it!

37:51.019 --> 37:53.863
In three, two, one...

37:54.105 --> 37:56.449
Go! Let's see who'll beat me!

37:56.524 --> 37:57.696
Come on, Dink!
You can do it!

37:57.817 --> 37:59.034
Once.
Just beat me once!

37:59.110 --> 38:00.111
- It's over.
- Come on.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.242
- You can do it.
- You got this!

38:01.362 --> 38:02.534
That's five in a row!

38:02.864 --> 38:04.866
- Who's the boss?
- You the boss, Bonzo.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.081
That's right. I'm the boss.
Let's go again.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.454
I'm gonna make this six.
Ready?

38:08.536 --> 38:09.879
You'll get better with practice.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.376
Yeah, let's do it again sometime.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.716
Mmm-hmm. That was fun.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.011
- Where were you?
- Practicing.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.181
In free time.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.383
You don't practice with her.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.936
In fact, you don't practice at all!

38:28.932 --> 38:31.651
May I speak to you privately, sir?

38:36.898 --> 38:37.899
Hey...

38:38.608 --> 38:39.609
Wiggin!

38:40.610 --> 38:42.157
Hey! <i>Pendejo!</i>

38:42.237 --> 38:43.910
Don't you ever turn
your back on me!

38:43.988 --> 38:45.865
If I'm gonna be useful in this
toon, I have to practice!

38:45.949 --> 38:47.070
You will do what I tell you!

38:47.075 --> 38:49.195
I will follow all commands
you are authorized to give.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.621
But if you take away my free time,

38:50.745 --> 38:51.746
I will get you iced.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.090
Are you threatening me, snot?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.468
No.

39:02.924 --> 39:06.269
Listen. I know you want to trade me.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.264
But no one will take me
if I don't know anything.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.981
Let me practice.
You can get rid of me sooner.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.650
I already gave you an order!

39:12.767 --> 39:14.269
I know. In front of everybody.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.402
And you don't want
your soldiers to think

39:15.478 --> 39:16.479
that you backed down.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.528
So, for tonight, you can say
that you won this argument.

39:19.607 --> 39:20.733
Then tomorrow,
you can tell everybody

39:20.817 --> 39:22.364
that you changed your mind.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.904
You'll look generous,
I'll get to train,

39:23.987 --> 39:25.955
we both win. Deal?

39:27.323 --> 39:29.451
You'd better watch
your back, Wiggin.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.509
Wake up!

39:46.301 --> 39:47.393
Wake up, <i>mis pendejos!</i>

39:47.635 --> 39:49.888
Battle with Leopard in 10 minutes!

39:49.971 --> 39:51.723
- Hey, Wiggin!
- Yes, sir!

39:51.973 --> 39:53.190
I changed my mind.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.654
Maybe by watching my toons,
you'll learn something

39:57.812 --> 39:59.530
and I can trade you easier.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.358
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!

40:01.733 --> 40:04.361
Move! Everybody, let's move!

40:04.569 --> 40:07.368
<i>Salamander is number one!</i>

40:09.699 --> 40:12.202
<i>There's no one like us under the sun</i>

40:15.204 --> 40:18.083
<i>'Cause Salamanders,
we're on top</i>

40:20.585 --> 40:23.008
<i>When it comes to winning,
we never stop</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:27.513
Salamander halt!

40:28.676 --> 40:30.349
At ease.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.388
What's the play?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.231
Four winds.
Toon A, up,

40:34.349 --> 40:36.522
B left, C right, D down.

40:38.019 --> 40:41.023
You, Wiggin. You hang
back near the gate.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.237
Bonzo, my toon'll be a
man short without him.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.156
He knows nothing about
our formations, Dink.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.952
He'll only get in the way.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.405
You come out last.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.040
Hang back and observe.
We don't need you.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.451
Step aside.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.082
Go, Salamander!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

40:59.290 --> 41:01.884
Go, go, go, Salamander!
Go! Go!

41:35.576 --> 41:36.793
We gotta break them up.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.373
Fly, you lock with me.
Petra rides chariot!

41:39.455 --> 41:40.456
- Got it?
- Got it!

41:40.581 --> 41:41.753
- Ready?
- Ready.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.586
In three, two, one...

41:58.808 --> 42:00.060
- I'm hit!
- Me too!

42:00.143 --> 42:01.816
Keep shooting, Petra!

42:02.353 --> 42:03.354
Body hit her!

42:03.479 --> 42:05.026
- Take her out! Go!
- I'm on it!

42:28.880 --> 42:29.881
Wiggin!

42:30.006 --> 42:31.974
What are you doin'?
I told you to stay back!

42:40.391 --> 42:41.438
Are you okay?

42:41.517 --> 42:43.019
What are you doing here?
Bonzo will kill you.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.236
I can't go back now.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.954
Well, then get in the game.
We're losing.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.182
They've got half their
toon back near their gate.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.698
Put your feet to mine. Redirect me.

42:51.861 --> 42:52.862
Play dead.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.409
Don't draw your weapon
till you know you have a shot.

42:54.489 --> 42:55.490
Got it.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.832
In three, two, one...

44:13.067 --> 44:15.911
Smart move, holding Wiggin back.

44:41.429 --> 44:42.601
Where'd you learn all this?

44:42.847 --> 44:43.939
I had a brother.

44:44.265 --> 44:45.767
- Had?
- Have.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.148
Come on. Let's go again.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.779
But use your arms,
not your hips.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.030
Officer on deck!
A-ten-hut!

44:58.154 --> 45:00.031
I thought I told you not to
train with her.

45:00.489 --> 45:03.208
I thought we'd agreed
that free time was free, sir.

45:04.827 --> 45:05.828
At ease.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.008
Stop it, Bonzo!

45:12.877 --> 45:15.221
Try making me look
like a fool again

45:15.296 --> 45:16.468
and I'll kill you.

45:27.183 --> 45:28.184
Are you okay?

45:29.894 --> 45:30.895
Yeah.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.877
What do you want me to do?

46:41.882 --> 46:43.259
Valentine?

46:47.096 --> 46:48.598
How can you be in my game?

46:51.559 --> 46:52.560
<i>Ah!</i>

48:30.324 --> 48:31.325
Well done.

48:31.409 --> 48:32.410
<i>You're a killer now.</i>

48:35.996 --> 48:37.498
Nightmares, Launchie?

48:37.832 --> 48:39.550
Keep 'em to yourself.

48:40.751 --> 48:44.255
<i>You said the game
would reveal his state of mind,</i>

48:44.505 --> 48:45.882
<i>not screw with it!</i>

48:46.090 --> 48:49.060
How did his psycho brother
end up in the game?

48:49.260 --> 48:51.354
<i>He's obviously feeling
some psychological pressure...</i>

48:51.429 --> 48:53.306
Of course he's feeling pressure,
Anderson!

48:53.389 --> 48:55.437
This is a boot camp for kids

48:55.516 --> 48:57.644
that are gonna have to
face a real enemy!

48:57.726 --> 48:59.444
<i>The game is a thought relationship</i>

48:59.520 --> 49:01.113
<i>between the child and the computer.</i>

49:01.355 --> 49:02.698
<i>Together they create stories.</i>

49:02.898 --> 49:04.900
Then change the story!

49:05.109 --> 49:07.077
<i>The stories reflect
the child's emotional reality.</i>

49:07.194 --> 49:08.241
<i>I can't change that!</i>

49:08.529 --> 49:11.203
<i>I don't know how these images
got into the game.</i>

49:13.409 --> 49:15.036
Erase the game.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.481
Doin' well.

49:45.566 --> 49:46.567
Very well.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.744
Top test scores in class.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.909
Highest Battle Room ratings.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.494
But you have a habit
of upsetting your commander.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.243
I find it hard to respect someone

49:55.326 --> 49:57.044
just because they outrank me, sir.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.292
Puts you in a difficult
position, doesn't it?

49:59.413 --> 50:00.414
Yes, sir.

50:01.081 --> 50:03.334
You don't like taking
orders from Bonzo.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.756
No, sir.

50:05.503 --> 50:08.177
Perhaps you'd prefer to
give them yourself?

50:08.839 --> 50:09.840
Sir?

50:10.007 --> 50:12.260
How would you like to
lead your own army?

50:12.593 --> 50:13.594
Dragon Army.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.313
Sir, I've never heard of
a Dragon Army.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.108
We discontinued the name
four years ago.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.102
No Dragon Army ever won a battle.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.443
Then why not a new name, sir?

50:24.605 --> 50:26.778
Because we already
have the uniforms.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.993
And who will be in this army, sir?

50:30.110 --> 50:31.862
Misfits. Like you.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.285
Oddballs who might just be brilliant

50:34.698 --> 50:36.200
with the right commander.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.338
Your new quarters.

50:50.798 --> 50:52.641
Your soldiers are
being notified now.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.468
You will address them in 15 minutes.

50:56.971 --> 50:58.473
Do you think they'll follow me?

51:40.848 --> 51:42.521
A-ten-hut!

51:42.683 --> 51:44.026
Officer on deck.

51:46.353 --> 51:47.354
At ease.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.861
Welcome to Dragon Army.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.613
Bunking will be arranged
with youngest at the front

51:51.692 --> 51:52.693
and veterans at the back.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.028
Ender,

51:54.737 --> 51:55.909
every other commander
has their seniors

51:56.030 --> 51:57.031
closest to the door.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.370
Well, I don't intend to be
like every other commander.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.286
What am I doing here, Ender?
You don't even like me.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.916
I didn't select this army, Bernard.

52:04.121 --> 52:07.125
But I intend to make it
the best in this school.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.384
I think you can help
make that happen.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.881
Am I wrong?

52:13.881 --> 52:14.882
No, sir.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.677
You will respect one another.

52:17.760 --> 52:20.104
If anybody has an idea they
think is better than mine,

52:20.220 --> 52:21.267
I wanna hear it.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.224
I can't be expected to
do all the thinking

52:23.307 --> 52:24.433
in this army, can I, Bean?

52:24.933 --> 52:27.356
- No, sir!
- Then let's get suited up.

52:27.436 --> 52:29.655
- Training starts now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

52:42.451 --> 52:43.953
He's pushing them hard.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.796
Might even make
something of Bernard.

52:45.996 --> 52:48.590
Command School is
pressing for a decision.

52:50.626 --> 52:52.503
Tell them we need more time.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.931
We're out of time.

52:56.757 --> 52:57.929
Lieutenant.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.269
Tomorrow's game will
commence at 0300.

53:00.469 --> 53:01.686
Yes, sir.

53:16.443 --> 53:17.660
Wake up! Wake up!

53:17.778 --> 53:20.531
Battle with Salamander and Leopard!
In five!

53:20.698 --> 53:21.915
Two armies at once?

53:21.990 --> 53:23.458
The Colonel is changing the rules!

53:23.617 --> 53:25.697
In a battle with the Formics,
there will be no rules.

53:27.830 --> 53:28.831
You all right?

53:29.665 --> 53:30.666
I twisted my ankle.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.000
How bad?

53:32.126 --> 53:33.252
Not good.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.837
Dink, get him to the infirmary.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.556
The rest of you, let's move!
Come on! We're late! Come on!

53:49.184 --> 53:50.481
They already opened the gate?

54:07.369 --> 54:08.370
Petra?

54:08.495 --> 54:09.792
Two armies weren't enough?

54:09.872 --> 54:11.169
They had to block your view too?

54:11.373 --> 54:12.545
What are you doing here?

54:12.750 --> 54:14.423
Colonel said you needed a sub.

54:14.501 --> 54:15.548
Guess he thought your odds were zero

54:15.669 --> 54:16.709
with me on the other team.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.259
Bonzo agree to this?

54:18.505 --> 54:20.786
- Colonel Graff's orders.
- He didn't have a choice.

54:21.842 --> 54:23.344
Dink. Kneel.

54:23.719 --> 54:26.347
- What?
- I have an idea. Kneel.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.016
Ready?

54:30.100 --> 54:32.694
In three, two,

54:33.020 --> 54:35.239
- one!
- Fire now!

54:35.522 --> 54:37.240
Shoot 'em! Fire!

54:50.412 --> 54:51.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out!

54:53.290 --> 54:54.917
Twelve clear on the wall!

54:55.042 --> 54:56.419
Twelve down, 20 to go.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.174
They could be right behind
these forward stars

54:58.253 --> 54:59.614
or all the way back at their gate.

55:02.925 --> 55:04.643
- Ready?
- Ready.

55:23.111 --> 55:24.112
Now!

55:25.322 --> 55:26.824
Pull!

55:40.838 --> 55:42.556
Dumbos have a bunch of stars
around their gate

55:42.631 --> 55:43.974
like a giant donut!

55:44.049 --> 55:45.050
They're just hanging behind 'em.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.052
- No one closer?
- Nah.

55:47.719 --> 55:48.720
Nice.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.765
Let's see how they
handle a formation.

55:50.973 --> 55:52.133
We've never done a formation.

55:52.307 --> 55:53.775
Then they won't expect one.

56:01.483 --> 56:03.030
We still outnumber him.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.471
We should storm him and crush him.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.706
No. We hold our positions.
He has to come to us.

56:07.781 --> 56:08.873
We can't lose.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.627
Open fire!

56:22.838 --> 56:24.135
They're drifting upwards!

56:24.298 --> 56:26.392
On my count, row two,
push row one!

56:26.466 --> 56:28.514
We're changing direction,
30 degrees!

56:28.635 --> 56:30.558
In three, two, one...

56:30.804 --> 56:31.805
NOW!

56:32.055 --> 56:34.649
Rear thrusters, row six... Now!

56:35.058 --> 56:36.810
Row five... Now!

56:37.185 --> 56:38.732
Come on.
Don't let them through.

56:38.812 --> 56:39.984
We've gotta break them up!

56:40.230 --> 56:41.982
We're almost there!

56:44.902 --> 56:46.074
- I'm hit!
- Hold on!

56:46.153 --> 56:47.154
Alai, are you okay?

56:47.237 --> 56:49.490
- Yeah! Are we there yet?
- Almost! Keep close!

56:49.573 --> 56:52.497
- Alai can't get hit!
- We're nearly there!

56:52.659 --> 56:54.332
Keep shooting!

56:59.833 --> 57:00.959
We did it! Yeah!

57:02.419 --> 57:04.842
Eat that! Dragon rules! Yes!

57:05.172 --> 57:07.345
- Who's undefeated now?
- Dragon!

57:08.592 --> 57:10.344
Still think he's not ready?

57:11.845 --> 57:13.097
Don't be smug.

57:13.347 --> 57:14.439
Yeah!

57:14.514 --> 57:17.518
Did you see the
look on Bonzo's face?

57:42.709 --> 57:43.881
We're tired of you, Ender.

57:44.294 --> 57:45.841
You know, your father
would be proud.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.844
Come to fight a boy in the shower.

57:47.923 --> 57:49.015
With your buddies.

57:52.094 --> 57:53.471
Go watch the door.

57:55.055 --> 57:56.056
Go!

58:07.609 --> 58:08.610
Look...

58:09.236 --> 58:10.909
You can say you won.

58:11.613 --> 58:12.956
I'll say you taught me a lesson.

58:13.156 --> 58:14.453
No, coward.

58:15.075 --> 58:16.247
Raise your fists.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.455
Come out and fight!
Come on!

58:20.080 --> 58:22.048
Come on, fight! Come on!

58:31.591 --> 58:33.639
I could break your arm!

58:44.438 --> 58:45.439
Bonzo?

58:48.275 --> 58:49.276
Bonzo!

58:49.776 --> 58:50.868
Bonzo?

58:51.486 --> 58:52.487
Help!

58:53.030 --> 58:55.124
We need help in here!

59:05.792 --> 59:08.011
Everybody knows he started it.

59:12.507 --> 59:13.804
Ender...

59:13.925 --> 59:15.518
- I am so sorry...
- Major!

59:18.847 --> 59:20.474
We should never have
allowed you to be alone...

59:20.682 --> 59:22.309
Not now, Major!

59:23.143 --> 59:24.360
Leave us.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.486
Leave him.

59:33.862 --> 59:34.863
Now.

59:36.698 --> 59:37.950
You too, cadet.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.312
He's gonna die, isn't he?

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.361
No... No.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:08.901
Please, don't lie to me.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:13.027
We're gonna send him home.
Back to Earth.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.658
So he can get better.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.577
I want to go with him.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.207
I can't let you go.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.000
You've come so far.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.544
And I wanna talk to my sister.

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:26.081
The Fleet owns you, Ender.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.384
Strategos would never allow it.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:33.885
Send me home, Colonel,
or I will resign.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.559
Don't threaten me, boy.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.230
I am not the enemy.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.228
I'm not so sure.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:55.243
I won't play this game anymore.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:00:59.573
I quit.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.328
What are you gonna do?

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.752
Waste millions on a loser?

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.094
You wanted to see me.

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:18.808
You can't resign.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.011
You have an obligation to stay here

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.846
and convince him to do his duty.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.355
My father trained horses.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.979
I've raised yearlings since
I was five years old.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.647
I know a thoroughbred
when I see one.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.020
We can't lose him.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.442
My God...

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.694
You really don't see them
as children, do you?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.157
It used to be a war crime

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.198
to recruit anyone
under the age of 15.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.538
When the war is over
we can have the luxury

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.456
of debating the
morality of what we do.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:43.375
When it's over,
what will be left of the boy?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.533
What does it matter if
there's nothing left at all?

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.455
We're using these
children to win a war.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.504
And if they come home,

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.878
it's my job to put them
back together again.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.341
Thanks for what you've done.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.844
- Where's Ender?
- Hello, Valentine.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.698
Why are you here?
Did something happen?

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.060
They won't let me see him.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.605
I need you to take a ride with me.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.362
He's gonna be
happy to see you.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.572
Come on...
You just want him to re-enlist.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.283
I want him to save lives.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.581
And what about his life?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.657
I've been sitting by Bonzo's bed,

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.243
waiting for him to wake up.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.796
But he may never wake up.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.087
Ender, he attacked first.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.968
And I fought back,
just like Peter taught me.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.801
I've had a lot of fights, Val.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.592
I've won because I've
always understood

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.143
the way my enemy thinks.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.937
And when I truly understand them...

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.184
you also love them.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.687
I think it's impossible
to truly understand someone

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.439
and not love them
the way they love themselves.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.441
- But in that moment...
- You beat them.

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.276
I destroy them.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.663
I make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.499
Ender, they want me to talk
you into going back.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.297
I told them I won't cooperate.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.736
I don't think you're hiding here

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.293
just because you care about Bonzo.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.053
I think you're hiding
because you're afraid.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.306
Afraid you don't know your enemy.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.342
Afraid you might lose.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.274
But what if you're the
next Mazer Rackham?

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.390
You can't hide here forever.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.985
But if you stay here,

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.404
if you don't try,

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.408
then we will all be lost.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.998
I'll miss you.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:19.587
I'll miss you, too.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:42.777
I need to know that you will
not block my emails again.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.244
<i>Attention,</i>

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:52.036
<i>prepare for transporter
docking operation.</i>

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.451
<i>Initiating final approach.</i>

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.045
I thought we were going
back to Battle School.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.248
- We're not.
- Where are we going?

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.710
Much further.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.387
<i>"Dear Valentine...</i>

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.477
<i>"I must now travel to our
advanced command base</i>

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:18.058
<i>"near the Formics' home planet,</i>

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.644
<i>"where I'll begin final training.</i>

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:24.819
<i>"If successful, I'll command

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:28.944
<i>"I wish there was another way,

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:32.410
<i>"Stay safe. Love, Ender."</i>

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.490
Not very hospitable, is it?

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:50.992
We took it from the Formics

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.570
27 years after Rackham's victory.

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:55.204
Flushed them out of these tunnels

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.823
like rats from a sewer.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.997
Drove 'em all the way back
to their home planet.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.161
- How long did they live here?
- We're not sure.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.122
This was a forward staging post

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.548
for their invasion of Earth.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.968
We built our base hereto be
closer to their home planet,

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.841
to allow instantaneous communication

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.388
by Ansible with our attack fleet.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.715
If they're on their home planet,

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.880
do we have them contained?

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.009
For now.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.515
If we have them boxed in,
why go to war?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:22.398
For the same reason that
you kept kicking that bully

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.358
before I recruited you.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.526
The purpose of this war
is to prevent all future wars.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.029
Your training begins
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.448
Sergeant Dap will show you
to your quarters.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:38.740
Yes, sir.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.251
We're still re-seeding
the atmosphere.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.094
It's breathable, but thin.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.671
In the event of an evacuation,

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:55.428
two breaths every minute
from one of these

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.767
will compensate for lower
levels of surface oxygen.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.220
Lights out in five.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.709
Who are you?

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.640
Look, this may be amusing to you,

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:20.996
but they'll come looking for me.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.020
You wanna fight me?
Is that the test?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.147
To see if I'll attack an old man?

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.395
Well, I won't.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:38.568
I'll just sit this one out.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:46.914
Okay. You win.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.504
Since when do you tell
the enemy when he has won?

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:50.751
I surprised you once.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.003
Why didn't you destroy
me immediately after?

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.424
I thought you were a teacher.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.260
There is no teacher but the enemy.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.797
Only he will tell you
where you are weak,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.927
where he is strong.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:03.017
From now on,
I am your enemy, got it?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.850
- Yes.
- Good.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.986
During training, I will devise
the strategy of your enemy.

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.691
Remember, he is stronger than you.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.527
From now on, you are
always about to lose.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.782
Sir?

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.207
Do you have a name?

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.584
Mazer Rackham.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:37.252
What?
You thought I was dead?

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:41.177
Sir, I've been building
models of your planes

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:42.882
since I was six years old.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.220
I have a question, sir.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.392
On the vids,

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:50.602
they always cut out

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.817
right after you destroy
the one carrier.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:55.398
Why?

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.564
Get dressed.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.611
Sir, I've already seen this.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.261
And I wanna know
what happens after.

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:06.364
Just watch.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.593
After the explosion cleared,

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.764
everything was incredibly still.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:36.439
Their ships just stopped shooting.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.901
And then they started
falling out of the sky.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.827
Scroll back, please.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.243
To just after you
lost your wing man.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:55.580
There.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:56.793
Play back, please.

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.342
You took cover in the cloud.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.089
You couldn't see anything,

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:07.801
so you must have been
using your HUD.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.310
There. Stop.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:12.934
You saw something.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:15.642
What did you see in your HUD?
Did you find a pattern?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.435
Very good, Ender.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:25.530
Thermal imaging from a satellite.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.830
The enemy's in red.
What pattern do you see?

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.327
It seems random.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:31.949
But it's not.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.371
There's an epicenter, right there.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.168
Meaning?

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:40.249
You took out that one
particular ship,

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.880
and the rest just

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.377
gave up?

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:45.671
Why?

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.643
To what animals are the Formics

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.015
most often compared?

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.313
- Ants.
- Which have...

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:56.311
A queen...

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.734
Who directs the worker ants.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.398
What she thinks they do.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.733
Without her,
they can't think for themselves...

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.200
And they die.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.703
You destroyed the queen's ship.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.078
I must have. Yes.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.244
- But you can't be certain?
- No.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.543
And so the Hegemon insisted
we keep it classified.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.703
That's why they never show
the rest of the battle.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:19.710
Or my face.

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:21.590
To the world I'm dead.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.051
Colonel...

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:26.212
Your face...

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.381
You mean, why is it marked?

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.060
My father was a Maori.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.389
Lost him in the war.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.769
Ta Moko is a way to
connect to my past.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.191
To my inner skin.

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.608
It was a way for me to
speak for the dead.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.243
Sir, have you ever seen a queen?

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.536
No. No one has.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.464
But if the Formics have
rebuilt their fleet,

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:02.165
there must be more than one queen.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.216
Yes, of course.
On their home planet.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.857
What happened when
you attacked here?

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:08.713
- Did you find one?
- No.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:10.593
Why did they come?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.220
Water.

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.617
Attention!

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.120
Officer on deck!

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.664
- Hey, Bean.
- Ho, Commander!

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:41.620
Petra.

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:42.838
We thought you were iced.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:44.595
We were gonna have to
have Dink take over.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.000
That was never gonna happen!

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:47.797
<i>Salaam,</i> Alai.

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:48.885
<i>Salaam,</i> Commander!

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.134
- Bernard.
- Good to see you, sir.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:52.969
At ease.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.780
While you've been skinny-dipping

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.054
the Colonel's been flogging us
to death on the simulator!

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.218
All right. Take your seats.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.022
In a matter of weeks

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.017
we may be called on to
fight a real battle.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:05.645
Let's bring your
commander up to speed.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.528
Our latest probe images
will give you an idea

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.321
of what's happening
on the enemy planet.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.919
Like us, they appear to have
a population growth rate

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.621
that's unsustainable.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:26.670
For now, they're contained
on their planet.

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.049
Time is not on our side.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:29.543
Where are they?

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:31.629
High surface temperatures limit

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:35.012
their above-ground activity
to just a few hours a day.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.595
What's most alarming is the rate

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:41.021
at which their military
power is expanding.

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.833
But they have not yet
moved against us.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.080
No.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.469
They're planning to
colonize another planet

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:13.304
before they breed
themselves into extinction.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.596
Our orders are to defeat them

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:17.011
before they pose an
irreversible threat.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.389
Their very
existence is a threat.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:20.849
Is that clear, Commander?

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:24.769
- Clear, sir.
- Good.

01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:27.064
Carry on, Colonel.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.481
We will begin with
photo real simulations

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.737
to best approximate real battles.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.569
You will command overall strategy.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.784
Your toon leaders will
each command a battle group.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.245
You will issue orders to them.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.076
They will issue orders

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.601
to their squadrons of drone pilots.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.280
Finally.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.370
Your entire fleet must support

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.453
and protect your most
important asset.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:31.298
Seventy billion dollars
of pure destruction.

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:34.135
The M.D. 500.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.679
Which Petra is trained to fire.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:37.922
M.D.?

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:39.928
Molecular Detachment Device.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:41.972
We call her "the little Doctor."

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:45.976
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.766
At the focus point, they reach
critical effective mass.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.521
A chain reaction spreads outwards,

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:51.986
shattering molecular bonds.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.821
Leaves nothing standing.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.856
That's the beauty of
the little Doctor.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:58.825
No need to identify
a specific ship for the queen.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:02.030
The chain reaction takes
out an entire swarm.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:05.495
But I'll only get one shot.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.350
Once the Formics see how she works,

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.044
they won't clump together again.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:14.501
You will have to win this war
one battle at a time.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:16.881
<i>Once our battle
fleet is detected</i>

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:19.221
<i>entering the Formic solar system,</i>

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:22.140
<i>we will have no alternative
but to engage.</i>

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:24.469
<i>I trust we have chosen
our commander well.</i>

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:25.974
There's greatness in him, sir.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.539
<i>And a killer instinct too, I hope.</i>

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:29.557
Absolutely.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.519
<i>Let's hope he's all
you claim him to be.</i>

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.695
<i>We'll be with you soon.</i>

01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:36.230
<i>Goodnight.</i>

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:38.239
Goodnight, sir.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:42.411
<i>"Dear Valentine...
So this is Command School.</i>

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.825
<i>"I'm finally here.</i>

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.703
<i>"Being a third, I've always
been so afraid I might fail.</i>

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:48.037
<i>"That I might not measure up.</i>

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:50.540
<i>"But they made me a leader.</i>

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.710
<i>"And I promise you that I'll do
everything I can to win this war.</i>

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.133
<i>"I know if anything ever
happened to you,</i>

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:57.551
<i>"I would never forgive myself."</i>

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:58.757
What are they doing?

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.676
Harvesting water.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.631
If you're going to use me,
I need to be closer.

01:20:02.715 --> 01:20:04.395
Too risky.
Let's not reveal our best weapon

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.348
in what should be an easy attack.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.554
Alai, Bean,
your Dreads peel away.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.440
Track them from below the ice
and mirror their path.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:18.776
They're swarming!

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.399
- They see us!
- Deploy all drones!

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.318
Give me four hyperbolic formations

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:24.278
with 90 degree offsets!

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:34.080
Open fire!

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:37.045
Bean, Alai, on my call,
fire directly up into the ice!

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.375
We're gonna shred 'em!

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.383
- In three, two, one...
- All right!

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:47.935
NOW!

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.678
<i>"As our training progresses,</i>

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:11.250
<i>"the simulations are becoming
more and more complex, and real.</i>

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.293
<i>"The pressure to win,
day after day,</i>

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.957
<i>“month after month, is intense.</i>

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:16.789
<i>"We get very little sleep.</i>

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:18.461
<i>"Some days, it's hard to keep up."</i>

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:20.255
- I got the breakaway!
- Great work, Bean!

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.257
Squadrons 43 through 57,

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.759
split to quadrant Foxtrot, 38, 89!

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.932
Ender, watch our right flank!
We need backup for Bernard.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:28.099
I see it! Bernard,
you flank them!

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.143
Copy that.
Using 10 through 18!

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:32.062
Alai, peel right!

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:34.515
Dink, compensate for
the pull of planet G8

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.641
and go full throttle!

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.393
Bean, mop up in sector Sierra!

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:39.149
I got a sprinter left in Lima!

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:40.688
Do Sierra now!

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:42.656
Bernard, watch your speed!

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:44.992
Dink, you are closing too fast!

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:47.282
- You said full throttle!
- Pull back now, Dink!

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.678
We can't absorb these
kind of losses!

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:15.046
War isn't a game where you get
to reboot and start over!

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.353
Sir, I can't win if I
don't take any risks.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:19.356
Nobody's saying not to take risks.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.403
Just don't try and
control everything.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.522
Let Bean improvise in the mop-ups.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.024
You focus on the big picture.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.490
- Delegate more to your teams!
- My teams are burned out!

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.038
How can they be effective
if they don't get any sleep?

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:32.873
Sleep deprivation is
part of your training!

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.537
A battle with the Formics
could last for days!

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.792
If I'd been smarter,

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.541
I could have annihilated
Petra's little Doctor

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:38.958
while you were micro-managing Bean!

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.584
That can't happen, understand?

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.042
- Yes, sir.
- Do you?

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:46.254
'Cause I've trained others.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:48.214
Each one so hopeful.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:50.594
Each one ultimately a failure.

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:55.854
All right, Colonel.
He understands.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.563
So I'm not the first?

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:04.946
No.

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.903
But you will be the last.

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.282
There's no time to
train anyone else.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.328
Son, tomorrow Colonel
Rackham will run

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.909
your final simulation.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.254
And if I win tomorrow?
What happens?

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:24.379
You will be ready to face
the real enemy.

01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:30.635
And you will be the finest
commander we've ever trained.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.775
<i>One more simulation
and I may have to go to war.</i>

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.943
<i>What happens when it's
no longer a game?</i>

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.108
<i>Real war is different.</i>

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:47.610
<i>I still know nothing
about my enemy.</i>

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.616
What if they could talk to us?

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:50.825
<i>They can't.</i>

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.286
<i>Dissections show no vocal chords.</i>

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.580
There are other ways
to communicate.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.042
<i>Ender, this is not a conversation</i>

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.460
<i>we should be having at 1:00 a.m.</i>

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.255
What if they could
"think" to one another?

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.961
What if we could "think" to them?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.925
<i>We need to sleep.</i>

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.806
<i>We have a graduation
battle tomorrow.</i>

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:16.468
Right.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:19.353
We're gonna get crushed.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:21.686
<i>We won't be crushed. We have you.</i>

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.521
<i>Now go to sleep.</i>

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.019
Goodnight, Petra.

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:26.486
<i>Goodnight, Ender.</i>

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.201
You still think he's "the one"?

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:34.866
We're committed.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.499
This boy has the empathy
to think like a Formic.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:45.005
To understand them,
anticipate them.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:52.880
He's not ready.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.887
You're never "ready."

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.515
You go when you're "ready enough."

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:11.315
Easy, sir.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:13.317
It's graduation day.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:25.203
Good luck, sir.

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:34.338
Attention!

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:38.717
At ease.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.262
Sir...

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:42.387
We have an audience.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.392
Commander Wiggin,

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:50.521
the Strategos is here today to
witness your final simulation.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:52.864
If you are successful,

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.691
he will endorse your promotion

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:58.325
to Battle Commander
of the entire fleet.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.450
Yes, sir!

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:02.287
This simulation is staged
around the enemy's home planet.

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.250
Good luck, Commander.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:05.869
Thank you, sir.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:12.918
Stay calm.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:14.294
Shoot straight.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.052
Here we go.

01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:57.675
They're waiting.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.969
Maybe they think we come in peace.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.679
I don't think
Mazer intends for us

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.427
to find a diplomatic solution.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:10.851
What's he waiting for?

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.987
Just give him a minute.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.862
Ender, what do we do?

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.159
Ender...

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:25.700
The enemy's gate is down.

01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:49.473
Petra. You're up.

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.604
They're spread too wide
for a chain reaction.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:52.684
She's right.

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:54.482
Just let him follow his instincts.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.904
All battle groups deploy drones.

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:57.398
Protect your carriers.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:59.900
Alai! You're squadron five!
Engage!

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:13.747
This is suicide.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.056
Oh, crap...

01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:32.557
They're swarming.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:36.982
Clumped enough for you now, Petra?

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.905
Once I fire I need
time to recharge.

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:40.982
Understood.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.238
Just go for the center.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:45.737
Fire now!

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:11.767
She did it...

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:13.769
Yeah...

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:22.445
Give me false color.

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:33.285
We're not done yet.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.791
- But we are so screwed...
- No, we're not.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:38.165
- Charged, Petra?
- No. I need two minutes.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.292
All fighters fall back
and surround Petra's ship!

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:41.801
Copy that.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:43.261
I want rings within rings.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:45.759
Layers upon layer.
Every fighter we have!

01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:53.980
Ender, you're gonna leave
our transporters defenseless!

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:55.265
If we're gonna win
this battle, Dink,

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:56.440
it's all or nothing now!

01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:57.983
When the outer layer is hit,

01:29:58.101 --> 01:29:59.978
the wreckage will continue to
drift with us, like a shield.

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:01.104
Do it now!

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:03.360
He's abandoning his entire fleet.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:06.281
He's in command.
There's no stopping him now.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.786
Ninety seconds, Ender!

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.044
No, no... No!

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:22.209
I'm losing my carriers!

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:24.961
My Dreadnaughts are out!

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:26.592
I don't care about Dreadnaughts!

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:27.968
Just protect Petra!

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.141
Like we protected Alai
when we fought Bonzo!

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.308
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:33.056
- Ready, Petra?
- In 60 seconds!

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:34.225
What am I aiming for?

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:39.484
The planet.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:41.110
What?

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:44.065
If we destroy the planet,
we destroy the queens.

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:46.449
Game over.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:48.685
Ender, my targeting sensor
needs a clear line of sight!

01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:50.491
We will clear a path!

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:52.868
All fighters maintain
a clockwise rotation!

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.658
Focus all firepower forward!

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.550
Ender, we're entering
their atmosphere!

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:08.759
We need to slow down!

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.360
We can't!
We're one unit now.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:11.424
We're not equipped to handle

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:12.766
the heat of passage
through an atmosphere!

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:14.124
Our drones are our heat shield.

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.186
Keep falling.

01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:16.763
Let gravity do the work.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.868
The shield won't hold forever!

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:32.742
We don't need forever.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:35.036
Thirty seconds!

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:36.750
I still don't have a clear shot.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.706
- We're burning up!
- Bean, on my count,

01:31:38.785 --> 01:31:40.958
accelerate your fighters
from the nose of the formation

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:42.922
- in a continuous stream.
- Yes, sir!

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:44.211
Like bullets from a rifle,

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.651
you will clear a visual for Petra!

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:48.761
We will drill a hole
through this swarm!

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:50.009
Petra, you will only get a second.

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:51.089
That's all I need!

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:54.263
In three, two, one... Now, Bean!

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.998
Shield integrity's at 5%!

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:20.994
- Now, Petra! Now!
- Seven seconds!

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:22.462
They've broken the shield!

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.708
Fire, Petra! We're out of time!

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:14.055
- We did it! Yeah!
- Yes!

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.726
- Great job, Ender!
- Yes! Thank you!

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:20.353
Good game, Ender!

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:21.604
Good job, guys!

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:22.680
Yeah!

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:26.643
How about that?

01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:31.405
Game over.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:41.699
What's he saying?

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:46.545
Restoring Ansible connection.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:25.076
What is this?

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:28.746
Why are we watching these images?

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:39.928
Ender...

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.309
Thank you.

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:46.648
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.604
Thank God for you, son.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:51.110
Why are these images in the program?

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:52.604
Ender...

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:54.822
We won.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.610
What do you mean, "we won"?

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:02.284
I beat him.

01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:06.581
<i>He runs the simulations.
He said it was a game!</i>

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:08.252
It was them or us, Ender.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:10.000
There was no other way.

01:35:11.623 --> 01:35:13.125
With this victory,

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:16.302
you've won all future battles.

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:18.671
You destroyed them.

01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:20.840
For all of us.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:46.596
Stand down.

01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:47.742
Move, move, please!

01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:48.872
- Move!
- Make a way.

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:56.129
- Ender...
- Stay away from me!

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.507
- You lied!
- Son, we were afraid

01:35:58.628 --> 01:35:59.845
- if we told you, you might...
- What?

01:35:59.963 --> 01:36:01.465
Refuse to play?

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:04.391
I've killed an entire species!

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:06.307
They would have done the same to us.

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:08.980
No! They waited.
What were they waiting for?

01:36:09.055 --> 01:36:10.853
Who cares?

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.733
We lost 1,000 men

01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:14.227
on the transporters you abandoned!

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.354
I abandoned them in order to win!

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:19.570
Yes! And they died proudly!
For us!

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:21.534
They might not have died at all!

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:28.954
If I'd known it was real,

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:30.501
- I would have...
- What?

01:36:30.576 --> 01:36:32.704
Called for "a dialogue?"
They can't even speak.

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:35.423
Watched them!
What were they thinking?

01:36:35.665 --> 01:36:37.963
Were they building an army
for a second invasion?

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:39.965
Or... Or simply preparing
to defend themselves...

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:41.091
Ender, stop...

01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:42.589
from us?

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.058
They came to Earth to
establish a colony.

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:47.351
We chased them away.

01:36:47.427 --> 01:36:49.600
And in 50 years,
they never returned.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.018
Makes no difference now.

01:36:51.097 --> 01:36:53.691
I will bear the shame of
this genocide forever.

01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:57.191
No. You will be
remembered as a hero!

01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:59.523
I will be remembered as a killer!

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:01.612
It was us or them.

01:37:01.858 --> 01:37:03.576
And you're sure we've killed
every last one of them?

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:05.240
I saw their whole planet destroyed.

01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:06.738
How do you know there
isn't another colony?

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:08.240
- Or another queen out there?
- There isn't!

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:10.458
We won!

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:13.082
- That's all that matters.
- No.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:18.049
The way we win matters.

01:37:25.965 --> 01:37:27.262
Don't hurt him.

01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:52.825
Go on. We need to let him rest.

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:54.418
May I stay with him?

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:58.123
Just so he's not alone.

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:00.583
Please?

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.012
Yes, of course.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.436
Come on.
Just let him rest.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:39.001
<i>What if they could talk to us?</i>

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:45.715
<i>What were they thinking?</i>

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.181
Valentine!

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.188
<i>What if we could "think" to them?</i>

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:06.528
Valentine!

01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:07.650
Ender!

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:09.573
Ender, wait!

01:39:10.903 --> 01:39:12.029
Ender!

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:15.700
What are you doing, Ender?

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:18.245
- I know what she wants!
- Ender!

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.871
Warning,

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:22.044
<i>you are leaving an
oxygen-balanced environment.</i>

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:23.708
Ender, stop!

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:26.210
It's not safe!

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:28.428
Ender!

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:37.396
Breathe. Just breathe.

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:51.244
In the mind game,
I saw this place.

01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:53.954
What are you talking about?

01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:57.124
The Formics accessed the
game through me.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:40:00.791
Their thoughts. My dreams.
All mixed together.

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:06.550
They were trying to communicate.

01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:09.758
What are you doing?

01:40:12.965 --> 01:40:14.262
Go back.

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:16.185
No.

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:17.261
Please...

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.264
I have to do this.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.425
<i>"Dear Valentine...</i>

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:57.602
<i>"I now know my dreams
were never my own.</i>

01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:59.478
<i>"They came from her.</i>

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.274
<i>"She was always trying
to communicate with me.</i>

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:07.104
<i>"I know the Formics
better than any living soul.</i>

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:09.689
<i>"I stole their future from them.</i>

01:41:10.523 --> 01:41:12.696
<i>"Now I must find a way
to make amends."</i>

01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:50.270
You're dying...

01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:08.037
Is it a queen?

01:44:30.347 --> 01:44:32.349
I will find a new home.

01:44:39.732 --> 01:44:41.029
I promise.

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:58.005
<i>"I miss you, Valentine.</i>

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:01.379
<i>"You won't be hearing
from me for a while.</i>

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:09.762
<i>"I need to find out</i>

01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:12.390
<i>"if I'm as gifted at
peace as I am at war.</i>

01:45:14.225 --> 01:45:16.319
<i>"They've awarded me
the rank of Admiral</i>

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:18.066
<i>"and left me to my own devices.</i>

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:20.356
<i>"Which suits me fine.</i>

01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:22.775
<i>"I'll travel the universe</i>

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.198
<i>"and carry with me a precious cargo.</i>

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:27.868
<i>"Because I have a promise to keep."</i>
