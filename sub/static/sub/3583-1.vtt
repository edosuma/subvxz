01:02.646 --> 01:05.608
<i>I think...</i>

01:07.109 --> 01:10.321
- What the...
- You have a new message.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.618
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

01:15.618 --> 01:17.578
<i>Don't do that, dude!</i>

01:19.205 --> 01:22.208
<i>Why? You did it twice!</i>

01:22.208 --> 01:25.503
<i>Objection based on experiences.
Live alone, buddy.</i>

01:25.503 --> 01:29.048
<i>How could you get married before me?
With whom anyway?</i>

01:29.048 --> 01:31.258
<i>Of course, with Mi-young.</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.469
<i>Why so suddenly?
Is she pregnant?</i>

01:33.469 --> 01:34.512
Crazy bastards.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.432
<i>No way. It's just about time.
And it makes me a jerk</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:41.727
<i>not to propose after 4 years
that We've been together.</i>

01:41.727 --> 01:43.979
<i>I'm serious.
Don't do that!</i>

01:43.979 --> 01:48.859
<i>Go for it...
being alone is lonely.</i>

01:48.859 --> 01:51.070
<i>You're still lonely
when married.</i>

01:51.070 --> 01:54.490
<i>Just go home, stupid!
I'm serious.</i>

01:54.490 --> 01:56.200
<i>I'm in front of her place.</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:09.839
Shall I end it?

02:09.839 --> 02:11.257
He wants to break up with you?

02:11.257 --> 02:16.720
He suddenly came to see me.
Even worse, I got puffy eyes.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.347
What does he want?

02:19.515 --> 02:21.767
I don't know.
He's been acting weird lately.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.019
He must be out of his mind!

02:25.354 --> 02:29.275
Oh, my!
I look like a pig!

02:36.240 --> 02:37.575
What is it?
Speak up quickly.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.415
I've been thinking lately...

02:45.207 --> 02:48.377
We've been arguing often...

02:50.212 --> 02:56.093
We've been dating already for 4 years.
Time sure flies.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.180
- So what?
- What?

02:59.763 --> 03:02.308
Cut the chase,
and get to the point.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.393
I left the washing machine on.

03:05.811 --> 03:10.608
Sure... washing machine.

03:10.608 --> 03:17.239
And I got the job a while ago...
although it doesn't make much money

03:18.073 --> 03:20.951
working as a civil servant.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.622
What's the point?

03:24.914 --> 03:30.461
What I mean is...
It's been 4 years already...

03:31.795 --> 03:35.966
And you don't know a thing
after all these years.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.302
My darling is ill!
Your eyes are swollen.

03:38.302 --> 03:42.598
Why didn't you tell me
that you're sick?

03:42.598 --> 03:43.599
Oh heck!

03:45.809 --> 03:47.186
Don't mind me.
Just say it!

03:53.734 --> 03:55.277
Shit...

03:57.071 --> 04:01.325
No, not now.
We're not in the right mood.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.868
Let me pick another clay.

04:03.702 --> 04:09.124
What mood?
Just say it.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.126
No, I'll do it later.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.091
Are you seeing someone else?

04:17.675 --> 04:18.550
What?

04:18.634 --> 04:21.011
That's why you get bored of me?

04:21.011 --> 04:24.682
What are you talking about?
No way, impossible!

04:24.682 --> 04:28.352
Then why bother me
asking to come out for nothing?

04:30.020 --> 04:30.980
Bother you?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.440
Why did you come
if it bothers you that much?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.360
If you just said so, it could've saved
much trouble for me.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.029
Then you had left quietly?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.698
Or what? You're saying
I would've created a scene?

04:40.698 --> 04:41.532
- Why are you so upset?
- Me? Upset?

04:41.532 --> 04:45.661
You make me want to leave now.
Go home! No one's holding you!

04:45.661 --> 04:48.205
I got it. Let's break up!

04:49.290 --> 04:54.169
Let me save your trouble!

05:00.884 --> 05:02.136
Damn it!

05:11.395 --> 05:21.322
MY LOVE MY BRIDE

05:24.908 --> 05:28.912
My sweet Mi-young,
I will make you happy.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.707
We'll live happily ever after.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.925
Don't worry, Mi-young.
I will make you happy.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.677
I believe in you, Young-min.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.437
<i>HOUSEWARMING</i>

05:54.938 --> 05:58.275
Try to focus at work
although you'll miss me lots.

05:58.275 --> 06:03.113
Mon cherie!
You forgot your bag!

06:03.238 --> 06:05.407
Right, my bag...
I can't help it!

06:19.505 --> 06:20.798
This is the arm bar technique.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.802
Need to cook your dinner...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.806
No bright card, no animal card
and I went for GO 3 times.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.392
Make a choice. One big hit
or several small ones?

06:31.725 --> 06:32.351
A big one!

06:32.351 --> 06:34.978
All right, better be prepared
for a really big shot!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.398
It's a double!

06:45.656 --> 06:47.491
What?

06:47.491 --> 06:48.909
Are you hurt?

06:50.411 --> 06:51.412
It's gone.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.005
- Let's go to work.
- I remember today's Sunday.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.634
Not working for me.
Go to work!

07:06.301 --> 07:09.930
I'll go shopping with mom later.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.014
She asked me to pick a coat.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.100
I'll have eel rice for lunch.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.937
Lots and lots of eels!
For my stamina!

07:17.855 --> 07:19.523
- Stamina!
- Great lord!

07:19.523 --> 07:23.068
Save it to yourselves.
You're torturing a lonely woman.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.362
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.989
You were so hot
all through the night.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.076
I am quite sensitive
to the sound.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.829
The place is well soundproofed,
but still I could hear you.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.459
Sorry we watched
the ball game last night.

07:38.459 --> 07:43.255
I don't blame for being
passionately in love.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.174
But please be considerate
of my babies...

07:47.676 --> 07:49.720
We only watched
the ball game on TV.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.639
Ball game only last night.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.351
Ball game it is, then.

07:57.936 --> 07:58.854
Go ahead.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.401
- Mi-young!
- Yes? Sure.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.405
Damn ball game.

08:10.115 --> 08:14.495
I want to watch the ball game, too.
With someone very loudly!

08:16.371 --> 08:21.251
We hate it when someone
smiles at his mobile for no reason.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.379
I was searching
for something.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.299
I let you off the hook
as you got just married.

08:27.549 --> 08:32.888
But now you reached the limit.
No more than 3 months.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.431
I got it.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.227
Take a tour with your questionnaire
at the community welfare centre.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.020
Yes, ma'am!
By the way...

08:41.145 --> 08:42.438
What?

08:42.438 --> 08:45.234
About the personnel reinforcement...

08:45.234 --> 08:48.779
Says a person who stares at
his mobile all clay?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.906
I love your shamelessness.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.997
<i>GOT THE SPECIAL BEDDING.
HURRY HOME!</i>

08:59.498 --> 09:02.459
- Mr. KIM Young-min!
- I didn't look at the phone.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.795
Can I file the moving-in report here?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.964
Are you... Seung-hee?

09:10.133 --> 09:14.096
I heard you were in New York.

09:14.429 --> 09:18.308
After living abroad for a long time,
I felt like living in a traditional house.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.394
I also heard you earn
the huge royalty!

09:20.394 --> 09:22.771
Stop it, it's embarrassing.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.901
Don't be embarrassed.
You like poetry and music.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.238
Lyricist is the perfect fit for you.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.867
You liked them both.
Do you still write poems?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.953
You always said
that you'd be a poet.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.206
Now I'm embarrassed.

09:41.915 --> 09:47.879
Why? I liked your poems.
Can still quote a few verses.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.882
Really?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.509
No reason to lie.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.220
This is where you live.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.641
Hey. Any plan for tonight?
It's Friday night.

10:00.017 --> 10:00.851
Tonight?

10:00.851 --> 10:05.731
- Right, you're a married man.
- Should be home early, I guess.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.984
No, not at all.

10:08.984 --> 10:14.197
We are quite independent.
Respecting each other's privacy.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.492
Good. Let's have
a get-together in a while!

10:18.201 --> 10:19.244
Shall we...?

10:19.494 --> 10:24.166
Why don't you
pick up the phone?

10:26.168 --> 10:30.255
You might lose your job
hanging onto your phone like that.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.471
- What's this?
- It's for her boyfriend.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.644
Don't you realize you've got
less than a month till the exam?

10:44.269 --> 10:45.854
You're not aiming for art high?

10:45.854 --> 10:47.564
I'm thinking of going to regular high
to focus on study.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.568
Then don't waste your time here.
Go to prep school instead.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.529
And stop torturing me.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.783
I'll have it in temporary custody.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.412
And you're not clone
till you finish the apple.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.750
It's not finished yet!

11:09.336 --> 11:11.338
Shit... you're not
even a real teacher.

11:11.421 --> 11:15.509
Right, so I have nothing to lose.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.142
You have to draw this, too.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.233
Don't bluff... she won't let you!
Isn't it too late?

11:31.233 --> 11:35.153
Sure we can!
Let me call her first.

11:36.238 --> 11:40.492
So Jung-jin's married
for two years.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.203
Ki-tae's been married twice.
And Dal-soo you are...

11:43.203 --> 11:44.955
He's clone my share.
So I'm still single.

11:45.288 --> 11:49.167
- One and only here.
- Right.

11:49.793 --> 11:53.964
You're single. And I'm a returned single.
What a diversity we have.

11:53.964 --> 11:58.051
I envy you the most.
Don't ever get married.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.471
Why do you keep saying it to me?

12:01.471 --> 12:04.599
You're not the only one.
I'm saying it to everyone.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.268
To save them from hell.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.395
But Young-min doesn't
seem to be in hell.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.397
He must do lots of good stuffs, right?

12:10.439 --> 12:11.898
- Good stuffs?
- You know.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.985
- You are a hopeless bastard.
- People never change.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.529
What's taking him so long?

12:17.529 --> 12:18.864
Gone for cooking or what?

12:18.989 --> 12:23.160
<i>Housewarming? How can I prepare
it at this hour?</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:25.662
<i>Didn't you tell me to wait
in leopard lingerie?</i>

12:25.704 --> 12:29.708
I'm so sorry.
I love you, Mi-young.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.085
But please do this for me.
You should do this!

12:32.085 --> 12:35.839
They claim that I am under
a wife's thumb like them.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.008
But you know that I'm not.
You're not an awful tyrant.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.845
Couldn't let them denounce you. I need
to show them our happy marriage!

12:42.012 --> 12:46.016
<i>What happy marriage?
I didn't wait for all day for this!</i>

12:46.016 --> 12:49.269
Just order some Chinese...

12:49.269 --> 12:53.148
And pigs' feet maybe...
Also some beer?

12:53.148 --> 12:56.485
No forget it. I'll buy the beer.
It's too heavy for you.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.236
<i>Whatever!</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:01.782
Sorry, honey.
I love you so much, Mi-young!

13:01.782 --> 13:03.700
Why is it taking you so long?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.035
- Okonomiyaki?
<i>- What?</i>

13:05.952 --> 13:08.121
- You really don't have to...
<i>- What? this nonsense?</i>

13:08.121 --> 13:11.833
Got it, as it's your specialty.
We'll be right there!

13:11.833 --> 13:13.376
<i>- What okonomiyaki?</i>
- See you!

13:13.376 --> 13:15.295
<i>- Hello? Young-min!
- Okonomiyaki sounds good.</i>

13:15.712 --> 13:17.464
She's a great cook.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.008
- So? Can we or can't we?
- Of course, we can!

13:20.342 --> 13:21.384
Let's hurry!

13:22.719 --> 13:30.393
Okonomiyaki tastes best at the bar...
The bar inspires your writing...

13:37.275 --> 13:39.820
- Waiting for hubby?
- Good evening.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.491
Watching a ball game again?
When does the season end?

13:45.200 --> 13:49.079
No, he's suddenly
bringing the guests,

13:49.079 --> 13:52.958
so I ordered some food.
The delivery guys must be lost.

13:53.166 --> 13:58.171
Your hubby got some guts
to bring people home at this hour.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.047
That's what I mean.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.425
But would the delivery do enough?

14:02.843 --> 14:07.138
Your husband might lose face
even if it's a short notice visit.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.934
You never get old,
Seung-hee!

14:10.976 --> 14:13.395
The flowers get faded
in front of your beauty.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.438
They all withered.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.650
- Cut the crap!
- I got them as those were so pretty.

14:18.650 --> 14:22.028
- Do you like the color?
- Yes, perfect.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.739
- Good.
- You have a taste.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.074
You mean it?

14:29.452 --> 14:30.745
Hon... you've been
waiting for us?

14:31.621 --> 14:32.956
Oh, you're here already.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.041
How do you do?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.626
- Good evening.
- It's been a while.

14:37.002 --> 14:41.548
It's for you.
Sorry I missed your wedding.

14:41.965 --> 14:46.511
This is Seung-hee,
a famous lyricist. Remember?

14:46.511 --> 14:49.264
I told you about her a lot.

14:49.931 --> 14:54.144
Sure, you did. Except the part...
that she's a woman.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.647
Did he say that I'm a man?

14:57.814 --> 15:02.777
No, I must've misunderstood
as he called you bro.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.947
- She used to be!
- Stop it!

15:07.407 --> 15:11.786
Yes, we are like real brothers.
Known each other forever.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.456
Except I've got no balls.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.666
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.254
- This is our landlady.
- Hello, ma'am.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.258
- And these are my...
- I know... bros.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.511
You are a brother from now on!

15:28.553 --> 15:32.390
- We'll behave. Excuse us.
- Go ahead.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.352
Heard you prepared
a feast for us?

15:36.019 --> 15:41.024
You really didn't have to...Young-min
always brag about your cooking.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.568
- Our expectations are real high.
- Yes, thanks.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.945
Shall we go in?

15:44.945 --> 15:49.324
Please go ahead.
I have to make a call.

15:50.325 --> 15:54.454
- Right, let's get in!
- No, no.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.373
- Yes, yes!
- Let's wait for her.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.503
Let's move fast!
Move, move!

16:02.921 --> 16:04.798
- Is this 372-1?
- Right.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.716
Smoked and spicy pigs' feet,
one each, right?

16:06.758 --> 16:07.676
Right.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.888
Delivery! Spicy chicken and
sweet and sour pork.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.223
Is it a right order?

16:13.348 --> 16:14.474
Yeah...

16:16.685 --> 16:17.560
Bring them
to the 2nd floor.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.896
It's an endless feast!

16:28.571 --> 16:32.659
Didn't they have dinner?
Like they had starved for weeks!

16:37.455 --> 16:38.498
So annoying.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.417
Don't do that!

16:40.417 --> 16:42.127
You stay still.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.586
I said don't!

16:46.798 --> 16:48.800
Is he a nut or what?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.301
It's my wedding photo!

16:51.428 --> 16:56.349
My sweet and sour endorphin,
give me your love.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.605
Everybody scream!

17:03.106 --> 17:04.190
It's my turn to sing.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.068
- What?
- Your bombs are so good!

17:07.068 --> 17:09.695
- Want a slow jam or a fast track?
- You're such a bomb mixer.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.864
Why do you guys do this me?

17:22.751 --> 17:25.170
It sounds like cursing.
Creepy!

17:32.218 --> 17:33.470
You even sing well!

17:34.262 --> 17:35.805
Thank you, Mi-young.
Love you, Mi-young.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.058
Leave me alone.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.143
Kill me, Mi-young.

17:40.685 --> 17:45.356
- They will be here all night?
- No way, they should go.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.817
Their wives are tyrants
unlike my sweet Mi-young.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.319
You're all mouth.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.239
Seung-hee said
your okonomiyaki is so good.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.408
Better than the famous one
she had in New York.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.161
She compared it
to Japanese food in New York?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.664
Please join us, Mi-young.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.500
- You must be tired.
- She's okay.

18:04.209 --> 18:07.337
I'm okay,
please have fun.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.214
The food is really good!

18:09.255 --> 18:12.967
Yes, especially
the pigs' feet are great!

18:12.967 --> 18:15.637
What? Better than the ones
in my neighborhood!

18:15.929 --> 18:18.348
Mi-young!

18:18.348 --> 18:20.767
Why don't you sing for us?

18:20.850 --> 18:24.854
We're not at the talent show.
Why sing in front of the people?

18:25.021 --> 18:29.359
We all did!
What does it make us then?

18:32.153 --> 18:35.073
It's not what she meant.
She really hates singing.

18:35.073 --> 18:38.284
Not to mention in public.
And she's a terrible singer.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.330
It's not polite to force her
to do what she's bad at.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.666
- Sorry, we're a bit wicked.
- We're wicked.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.877
- You don't have to do it.
- Yes.

18:47.877 --> 18:48.753
I will sing.
Not a big deal.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.807
Way to go, Mi-Young!

19:01.349 --> 19:03.893
One, two,
we're testing.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.565
She's so lovely!

19:12.235 --> 19:19.742
<i>How do you take it</i>

19:19.742 --> 19:32.255
<i>if I come closer to you?</i>

19:32.255 --> 19:37.260
<i>I can't be brave enough.</i>

19:38.094 --> 19:45.643
<i>But if you're leaving me,</i>

19:45.643 --> 19:50.398
<i>you're out of my world,</i>

19:50.940 --> 19:58.531
<i>I won't even know</i>

19:58.531 --> 20:03.411
<i>how to say good-bye.</i>

20:05.788 --> 20:10.084
<i>I'm such a fool</i>

20:10.960 --> 20:17.175
<i>to just...
just look at you.</i>

20:17.634 --> 20:23.264
<i>But I'm too afraid
we won't be even friends</i>

20:23.806 --> 20:28.019
<i>if I tell you
how I feel about you.</i>

20:39.155 --> 20:40.907
She asked us to stay,
how come we're leaving!

20:40.907 --> 20:42.909
- It might upset her feelings.
- Sure, come in. Stay.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.827
Here we go!
We should stay.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.663
It won't upset her,
not a bit!

20:46.663 --> 20:48.957
- How are you so sure?
- I am sure!

20:51.376 --> 20:52.168
You sure you'll be okay?

20:52.418 --> 20:58.007
No problem.
She does whatever pleases me.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.260
Call me if you're in trouble.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.513
My couch is all yours.

21:07.225 --> 21:12.146
Right.

21:12.522 --> 21:13.398
Good night.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.754
Thanks for tonight,
Mi-young.

22:03.156 --> 22:08.870
<i>I'm such a fool
to be afraid already</i>

22:09.287 --> 22:19.672
<i>if you're leaving me...</i>

22:20.548 --> 22:30.433
<i>I'm such a fool...</i>

22:30.683 --> 22:37.398
<i>not to tell you how I feel.</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:42.570
<i>It may be that I...</i>

22:48.117 --> 22:50.203
<i>LOVE YOU, MI-YOUNG</i>

23:04.050 --> 23:07.762
<i>NAGGING</i>

23:14.644 --> 23:17.688
Hello, is this
Ms. PARK Gye-ja?

23:18.147 --> 23:21.317
This is Samcheong-dong
community service center.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.529
Community service center.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.614
Community...

23:27.824 --> 23:31.577
Well, calling from
a town office. Right.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.539
I'm calling you to inform

23:34.539 --> 23:36.999
you're now qualified
to be a basic livehood beneficiary...

23:36.999 --> 23:39.502
Basic livehood beneficiary.

23:39.502 --> 23:42.964
Let me put it this way...

23:42.964 --> 23:45.800
do you have children?

23:45.800 --> 23:49.512
Son or daughter.
Do you have one? Good!

23:50.263 --> 23:52.432
No no no, not doughnut!

23:53.015 --> 23:54.308
Your daughter!

23:54.308 --> 23:56.769
D-a-u-g-h-t-e-r,
daughter.

23:57.687 --> 24:01.941
No, we're not giving
you doughnut!

24:01.941 --> 24:03.526
Actually, we are giving you
other things...

24:03.526 --> 24:06.320
after I check several things

24:06.320 --> 24:10.283
with your daughter.
On the phone...

24:10.283 --> 24:13.035
No, I'm not saying
she's on the run.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.208
Ma'am... let's do this.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.961
Let me call you later.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.505
No. I said I will call again.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.048
Yes, bye for now.

24:26.048 --> 24:30.344
No one's stopping you here.
Please let us work, we're busy.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.848
Quiet or I give you hard time!

24:34.015 --> 24:37.185
You're full of crap!
Doing work? Neh!

24:38.811 --> 24:39.645
Ta-da!

24:39.729 --> 24:42.648
Oh, here comes clear Chief KIM.

24:42.899 --> 24:47.069
We're serving the country here.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.572
Please go home first
and take some rest.

24:51.699 --> 24:52.783
What's this?

24:52.909 --> 24:54.368
It's for the taxi.

24:54.619 --> 25:03.127
No kidding.
It's not even close.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.424
Here's 10 bucks.

25:09.258 --> 25:12.720
Now we are talking.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.934
Make him an example,
you slops!

25:17.934 --> 25:20.269
I love you, Chief KIM.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.438
- Likewise.
- See you soon.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.282
<i>The one who gave me butterflies,
the one who gets me nervous</i>

25:35.451 --> 25:36.869
Mi-young, coffee please!

25:47.630 --> 25:48.631
Young-min!

25:51.676 --> 25:54.929
I asked you million times already

25:55.513 --> 25:57.181
to pee with the toilet lid up.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.814
Oh, sorry.
Old habit...

26:05.147 --> 26:08.776
You never wrote me a letter.
Now you get poetic sentiments?

26:08.776 --> 26:15.199
Don't wear sweat pants
when you're going out!

26:15.199 --> 26:18.661
Didn't I tell you to throw away
this worn out shirt?

26:18.661 --> 26:20.329
What'd people think of me
letting you wear this garbage?

26:20.329 --> 26:21.664
You know what the landlady
told me yesterday?

26:21.664 --> 26:26.961
You just killed my ideas!

26:28.337 --> 26:31.632
Told you hundred times
to tidy up once you're clone!

26:31.632 --> 26:34.510
Am I married
or parenting?

26:37.179 --> 26:39.056
<i>- Don't be too late.</i>
- Why am I always the one to nag?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.934
- What?
- Can you do it before I tell you?

26:41.934 --> 26:46.105
<i>- You're stubborn like a kid.</i>
- Isn't this bothering you?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.192
<i>Not at all.</i>

26:51.110 --> 26:55.114
<i>Should we call it off?</i>

26:57.199 --> 26:58.367
Yeah, let's stop.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.256
Don't.
Let's sleep.

27:14.425 --> 27:19.889
- Please don't, I'm tired.
- I am, too.

27:19.889 --> 27:25.227
But we have to overcome
difficult times

27:25.227 --> 27:27.980
by uniting our bodies...

27:29.231 --> 27:31.275
I'm not really in the mood.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.236
Go to sleep.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.367
Why did you take off
my clothes

27:39.367 --> 27:41.577
if you're not up to it?

27:41.577 --> 27:45.706
I didn't take them off.
You did it yourself.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.084
Put the pants back on!

27:48.084 --> 27:51.170
I'll be the one who suffer
if you catches a cold.

28:10.189 --> 28:10.731
Ms. OH?

28:11.774 --> 28:14.944
Oh my!
What are you doing here?

28:14.944 --> 28:16.946
Been to a friend's wedding
and felt like a movie.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.702
This is my husband.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.620
This is Jun-soo working
at the same art institute.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.913
He was my junior at college.
I told you about him.

28:26.497 --> 28:27.998
Did you?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.334
I don't recall though...

28:30.334 --> 28:34.004
You're on a date?
Newlyweds...

28:34.004 --> 28:35.631
What you see is
not what you get.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.299
I begged him to come.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.844
- He might believe you!
- Why not? It is true.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.805
What time is your show?

28:47.643 --> 28:52.648
<i>I 'd never been married if I knew
I would meet you, Che GUEVARA.</i>

28:52.648 --> 28:56.318
<i>I thought he was your father.</i>

28:56.360 --> 28:58.487
<i>How tall is he?</i>

28:58.487 --> 29:01.532
<i>5.7 ft. he said,
but I never buy it.</i>

29:01.532 --> 29:04.285
<i>He looks much smaller
'cause of the bad proportion.</i>

29:04.994 --> 29:06.454
<i>What is this smell?</i>

29:06.454 --> 29:10.708
<i>Did you take the subway?
You smell like subway.</i>

29:10.708 --> 29:13.711
<i>I had no other option.</i>

29:15.463 --> 29:18.174
<i>I came in my BMW.</i>

29:19.175 --> 29:22.845
<i>Could only dream about it.
He's a minor civil servant.</i>

29:23.345 --> 29:26.015
<i>Not so smart for a guy
who has such a big head.</i>

29:26.015 --> 29:28.768
<i>How is he at night?</i>

29:30.311 --> 29:31.854
<i>Simply rubbish!</i>

29:31.854 --> 29:34.398
- Can I help you, sir?
- What?

29:34.398 --> 29:36.901
There are customers
who have troubles with this.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.569
- Look.
- Yes?

29:38.903 --> 29:41.030
- I am good.
- Excuse me?

29:41.197 --> 29:42.698
I am good at it!

29:46.368 --> 29:48.871
How about you?
Seeing anyone?

29:49.497 --> 29:52.708
- Kind of... I'm dating Jin.
- Really?

29:54.794 --> 29:57.379
- Great!
- Don't tell anyone. Promise.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.841
- Sure... your secret's safe with me.
- Hush, hush.

30:01.967 --> 30:02.718
You got them?

30:03.093 --> 30:04.678
What took you so long?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.890
My head is big
but my brain is not.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.520
Pleasure meeting you.
Take a good care of her.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.607
None of your business.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.902
He's joking, sorry.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.488
You're too tall.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.115
Definitely blocking the sight
of the person behind you.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.877
Sorry, my legs are
longer than they seem.

30:36.877 --> 30:37.753
I'm so sorry.

30:52.434 --> 30:58.691
We'll have crab meat soup,
pork and chicken.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.402
Just two black noodles, please.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.612
Two black noodles.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.616
You said I can have
anything I want!

31:07.616 --> 31:10.035
- Do you know Che GUEVARA?
- Che GUEVARA?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.705
- Do you know where he's from?
- He's Cuban.

31:12.705 --> 31:17.167
So ignorant!

31:17.167 --> 31:19.044
- Where is he from then?
- Won't tell you.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.797
- What?
- Google him.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.757
Internet is not just
for online shopping.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.095
- What's wrong with you today?
- What?

31:28.095 --> 31:30.306
- Did I do something wrong?
- Nope.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.016
What was it then earlier?

31:32.016 --> 31:33.642
In the cinema,
I was abashed.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.603
- So embarrassed.
- Did I embarrass you?

31:35.603 --> 31:37.271
Sure, you did.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.648
Why laughed to the kiss scene?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.483
What's wrong with laughing?
Should I cry to see

31:41.483 --> 31:43.235
a couple making out?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.697
Hell...

31:50.326 --> 31:53.495
<i>She doesn't realize at all
what she did wrong.</i>

31:53.495 --> 31:58.584
<i>She ï¬‚irted with a stranger
in front of her husband.</i>

31:58.584 --> 32:00.461
<i>And keeps a secret with him?</i>

32:00.461 --> 32:01.503
<i>Hush, hush?</i>

32:03.672 --> 32:06.508
<i>Look at her
eating like a pig.</i>

32:06.508 --> 32:07.801
<i>It kills my appetite.</i>

32:08.177 --> 32:10.387
<i>Is it delicious?
Is it that good?</i>

32:11.263 --> 32:12.848
<i>Damn!</i>

32:29.698 --> 32:30.741
What are you doing?

32:32.409 --> 32:33.243
Pardon?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.954
What the heck
is wrong with you?

32:36.705 --> 32:38.707
Damn it's hot!

32:39.166 --> 32:42.127
He just went out
without eating.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.213
Is it a hunger protest
or what?

32:44.213 --> 32:45.381
<i>Where did he go?</i>

32:45.381 --> 32:48.384
Don't care.
Should be drinking with bros.

32:48.759 --> 32:52.221
With that young kid!
In my presence!

32:52.221 --> 32:55.015
- Did they make out?
- They talked, just a talk!

32:55.015 --> 32:58.102
- Talk is good.
- You never know what they talk about.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.229
He's such a miser
to my family.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.899
When we visit his parents,
he prepares 300 bucks in cash.

33:03.899 --> 33:07.736
But for my folks, he brings
a 100 bucks gift certificate!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.655
And always looks for freebies
from my parents.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.409
She hates me writing poems,
what's worse is...

33:13.409 --> 33:16.453
she refuses doing it!

33:16.453 --> 33:20.124
You still have the Kleenex left,
we gave you at housewarming?

33:20.124 --> 33:20.666
It's already gone.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.335
Then your sweet clays
are officially over.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.630
<i>It's how it works in marriage.
His side takes, your side gives.</i>

33:26.630 --> 33:30.801
<i>That's how we become to hate
everything related to hubbies.</i>

33:31.301 --> 33:34.930
Yes, I totally agree with you.

33:34.930 --> 33:35.639
Most of all,

33:36.181 --> 33:38.267
I hate his hobby best!
Damn poetry!

33:38.267 --> 33:44.898
I mastered the skill to switch
my wife with a hot actress.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.943
At nights,
with my imagination.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.946
Ain't I great?
Can you get it?

33:51.155 --> 33:53.115
I'm not like you!

33:53.407 --> 33:55.784
<i>Kyung-mi's husband got
a stomach cancer. Stage 3.</i>

33:55.784 --> 33:57.536
What? How come?

33:58.746 --> 34:00.456
He's still young.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.124
<i>It's all because of stress.</i>

34:02.624 --> 34:05.461
<i>So, don't push
your hubby too much.</i>

34:05.461 --> 34:10.632
<i>I heard the second most stressful job
is a social welfare worker.</i>

34:10.632 --> 34:11.632
Really?

34:11.884 --> 34:13.552
<i>Hey, my girl wants me.
I should go.</i>

34:13.552 --> 34:14.553
Right, bye.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.893
What is he doing in this weather?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.228
It pours.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.939
You shouldn't be out
at this hour.

35:07.189 --> 35:10.192
The world is too dangerous

35:10.192 --> 35:12.820
for a beautiful girl like you.

35:13.987 --> 35:14.863
Bah...

35:16.031 --> 35:20.327
Cover up your neck,
it's chilly.

35:26.583 --> 35:31.588
What would I feel
if you walked out on me like that?

35:32.214 --> 35:36.051
- I am sorry, I'm the bad thing.
- No.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.887
You're a good thing.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.432
You didn't have to
repeat 'thing'.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.355
You must be hungry.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.607
I only had three fish cakes.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.777
Fish cakes?

35:53.777 --> 35:56.530
I told you to eat properly.

35:57.573 --> 36:00.534
- Should I make some noodle?
- Like that.

36:01.577 --> 36:06.373
Oh, I googled
Che GUEVARA.

36:07.166 --> 36:10.127
- Did you?
- Yes, he's from Argentina.

36:10.127 --> 36:13.255
My girl is way too smart!

36:14.214 --> 36:17.968
Don't treat me like a baby.

36:17.968 --> 36:21.930
You're not a baby.
No baby can be this hot.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.518
Do you know
you're a lucky guy?

36:26.518 --> 36:31.773
I'm so lucky... lucky me!

36:38.864 --> 36:41.742
<i>POSSESSED BY
AN OBSCENE DEMON</i>

36:43.076 --> 36:45.954
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

36:46.663 --> 36:50.167
<i>I'm still a newlywed.
Is it already ennui stage?</i>

36:50.667 --> 36:54.171
<i>Nonsense!
I'm still in love with my wife!</i>

36:54.171 --> 36:59.468
<i>Then why the urge of doing
other women hits me like crazy?</i>

36:59.635 --> 37:02.930
<i>Look those legs...
Why am I like this?</i>

37:02.930 --> 37:05.098
<i>I'm like a rutting mutt.
No taste or whatever...</i>

37:05.098 --> 37:07.559
<i>I liked pure
and innocent girls!</i>

37:08.185 --> 37:10.771
<i>I sure did.
Wake up, Young-min.</i>

37:12.856 --> 37:15.609
- Chief.
- What? I didn't look at...

37:15.609 --> 37:18.111
I was making a copy...

37:18.111 --> 37:18.695
Pardon?

37:20.989 --> 37:24.409
I tried to call all the seniors
living alone listed here.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.286
Two of them never answered.

37:28.372 --> 37:33.919
<i>Why do I want to impress
this plain young kid?</i>

37:36.255 --> 37:37.506
Ji-hye.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.511
Do you know
where Che GUEVARA's from?

37:42.803 --> 37:44.846
- Chegueva?
- Yes, what?

37:44.846 --> 37:47.849
What's that?
Is it like guava?

37:48.809 --> 37:50.811
<i>Why the hell</i>

37:50.811 --> 37:53.397
<i>do I want to impress
an ignorant girl like her?</i>

37:57.567 --> 37:59.319
They're not answering?

37:59.319 --> 38:04.533
Mr. PAN Mok-won, 78
and Ms. LEE Young-lim, 83.

38:04.533 --> 38:07.786
I called them 3 times for 2 clays
but they never answered.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.455
Let's call a few times more
and if they don't answer,

38:10.455 --> 38:14.126
- I will have to visit the domicile.
- All right.

38:14.334 --> 38:18.714
<i>What a jerk...
these seniors might be dying!</i>

38:18.714 --> 38:22.884
<i>But all you care is the breasts
of this ignorant kid.</i>

38:22.884 --> 38:25.345
<i>You're a bastard, an animal!</i>

38:29.558 --> 38:32.894
This is Viagra salve
by Dr. JONES!

38:32.894 --> 38:35.856
It's an exclusive gift for you.
From your best friend.

38:35.856 --> 38:39.318
Viagra?
How much do we take one time?

38:40.235 --> 38:41.820
You son of a bitch!

38:41.820 --> 38:42.904
Spit it out!
It can kill you!

38:42.904 --> 38:44.698
I said it's a salve!
You ignorant bastard!

38:44.698 --> 38:47.242
- It looks mayonnaise to you?
- Ah, salve... I get it.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.872
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Give me that!

38:52.748 --> 38:55.917
This is a good stuff.
Let me try it on you.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.628
Even though I doubt
you need it.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.797
I don't need this.
I would rather need

39:00.797 --> 39:03.759
an anti Viagra thing.

39:03.759 --> 39:04.426
Why is that?

39:04.426 --> 39:08.930
I get to want to do it
with any girl at first sight.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.392
You finally got stranger alert!

39:12.392 --> 39:15.729
How do all the married men
deal with this?

39:15.729 --> 39:18.607
- Are you like that?
- Kidding? I am so like that.

39:18.607 --> 39:19.816
And you're okay with it?

39:19.900 --> 39:23.528
I feel like I'm being an animal.
Hate myself.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.781
It's very natural and human.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.824
Stop rubbing!

39:27.824 --> 39:30.035
- It can kill you.
- No way!

39:30.202 --> 39:34.206
- Hello.
<i>- Honey, I'm at mom's.</i>

39:34.956 --> 39:36.375
Again?

39:41.129 --> 39:43.632
- What?
- She's sleeping at her mom's.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.134
So you're off duty tonight?

39:46.134 --> 39:51.139
Dudes, I'm really restless. How about
the 2nd round at my place?

39:51.139 --> 39:54.434
Cut the bullshit! Now you got
a whole night to write poems.

39:55.811 --> 39:59.981
I really feel that
I shouldn't be alone tonight.

40:00.023 --> 40:04.403
Wake him up!
Dal-soo!

40:04.403 --> 40:05.987
Dude! Wake up!

40:08.407 --> 40:13.745
- Shit!
- Why?

40:13.745 --> 40:16.164
It hurts... so bad!

40:16.164 --> 40:19.084
It got jammed!

40:39.688 --> 40:40.689
Why? Why?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.192
Why?

40:45.569 --> 40:46.403
What are you doing?

40:46.403 --> 40:49.030
Hands off!

40:49.614 --> 40:50.532
You shouldn't do this.

40:52.242 --> 40:58.206
Please don't do this to me!

40:58.206 --> 40:59.833
Please don't.

41:11.887 --> 41:12.721
Young-min!

41:15.891 --> 41:16.558
Hey.

41:17.434 --> 41:18.518
What are you doing here?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.854
I'm off duty...

41:21.688 --> 41:22.397
No, what I meant...

41:24.774 --> 41:26.067
I just felt like walking.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.404
- You did?
- Yes.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.824
Do you know
why I quit writing poems?

41:33.575 --> 41:34.451
No, I don't.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.369
I got too lonely.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.498
<i>Should I move a bit closer?</i>

41:41.791 --> 41:44.711
<i>If she doesn't like it,
I can pretend I was joking.</i>

41:46.379 --> 41:50.258
<i>Look at her body.
So nice and slim.</i>

41:52.594 --> 41:55.055
<i>She even wrote
quite erotic lyrics.</i>

41:55.597 --> 41:58.058
<i>She wouldn't take
one night stand too seriously?</i>

41:58.058 --> 41:59.351
I am still lonely.

41:59.351 --> 42:02.437
<i>And she's saying herself
that she's lonely blah-blah.</i>

42:02.896 --> 42:05.941
<i>Let's start with holding hands.</i>

42:05.941 --> 42:09.402
Words can be so lively,
in a simple plain sentence.

42:09.778 --> 42:10.612
Yes, they are.

42:13.281 --> 42:14.824
<i>Look at her.
She doesn't push away?</i>

42:15.784 --> 42:19.621
<i>And then... shall I move
to the next stage?</i>

42:20.580 --> 42:24.584
I can introduce you
to some composers if you like.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.379
I had a crush on you.

42:28.421 --> 42:29.422
What?

42:30.465 --> 42:31.800
You're beautiful.

42:34.386 --> 42:35.387
What's with you?

42:36.012 --> 42:37.472
You're beautiful tonight.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.358
I'm sorry, so sorry.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.112
Give me a minute.

42:55.156 --> 42:58.201
<i>What?
Why is it so easy?</i>

42:58.618 --> 43:00.245
<i>Wait.</i>

43:00.245 --> 43:02.956
<i>Can I be this instinctive?</i>

43:03.623 --> 43:08.503
<i>And what about Mi-young?</i>

43:09.504 --> 43:10.880
- You may come in.
- Yes!

43:20.432 --> 43:23.268
<i>It's not manners to say no
to a girl who's so ready!</i>

43:23.518 --> 43:25.687
<i>Yes, show some courtesy!</i>

43:25.854 --> 43:28.106
<i>I used to love her once.</i>

43:28.106 --> 43:29.691
<i>Or I might be still in love.</i>

43:29.691 --> 43:35.113
<i>Quick! Damn innerwear!
Let go of me!</i>

43:35.113 --> 43:38.825
<i>Damn winter innerwear!</i>

43:38.825 --> 43:41.202
<i>Let go!</i>

43:43.330 --> 43:45.790
Oops, I am sorry!

43:45.790 --> 43:47.334
Are you okay?

43:48.084 --> 43:49.377
Sure.

44:05.185 --> 44:06.144
I love you, Mi-young.

44:13.068 --> 44:13.777
Hey you.

44:14.611 --> 44:15.904
Go off me, would you?

44:22.744 --> 44:26.498
Listen to me, Seung-hee!

44:43.348 --> 44:44.349
You scared me!

44:45.850 --> 44:47.185
Are you coming home now?

44:47.727 --> 44:50.063
What are you doing
at this early morning?

44:50.146 --> 44:52.107
Leaving the wastes.

44:52.107 --> 44:53.441
At this hour?

44:54.442 --> 44:57.696
All the cats in the neighborhood
seem to be horny.

44:57.696 --> 45:00.573
Can't sleep at all.

45:00.573 --> 45:05.954
Go up quick.
Your wife must be worried.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.377
- Let's keep it quiet though.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:13.461 --> 45:16.047
- Is the baseball season over?
- Yes, yes.

45:23.513 --> 45:24.931
<i>IT'S BETTER FOR US
TO HAVE STOPPED LIKE THAT.</i>

45:24.931 --> 45:26.099
<i>LET'S STAY AS FRIENDS, BRO! :)</i>

45:34.649 --> 45:38.194
<i>SURE.
GOOD NIGHT, BRO.</i>

45:48.872 --> 45:51.875
<i>ALL THE MESSAGES TO BE DELETED</i>

46:05.597 --> 46:07.849
<i>FIRST LOVE</i>

46:08.183 --> 46:11.686
- Mi-young! Coming home now?
- Hello.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.314
- The bill for water.
- Oh...

46:15.857 --> 46:17.859
What's up lately?

46:17.859 --> 46:22.030
I'm quite swamped at work.
It's an entrance exam season.

46:22.030 --> 46:24.491
You didn't raise your voice
last night though.

46:24.491 --> 46:25.325
What?

46:25.325 --> 46:27.243
I expected it to be noisy

46:27.243 --> 46:30.538
as your hubby
came home at dawn.

46:30.914 --> 46:34.125
He did?

46:34.375 --> 46:36.503
I went to bed early.

46:36.503 --> 46:38.588
He came in
almost in the morning.

46:40.340 --> 46:42.342
I see.

46:42.342 --> 46:45.220
He must be busy at work, too.

46:45.220 --> 46:48.431
What kind of work requires
drinking on duty?

46:49.891 --> 46:52.268
Look at you.
You got freckles!

46:53.394 --> 46:57.482
No way!
I'm still young for that.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.150
Impossible.

46:59.150 --> 47:02.904
They are surely freckles. What comes
next when you already have freckles?

47:03.029 --> 47:05.907
It will go away, I must've got
too much sunlight yesterday.

47:06.699 --> 47:09.494
You should take good
care of yourself. Look at me.

47:09.494 --> 47:13.039
I'm old but still called beauty
as I have a fair skin.

47:13.039 --> 47:14.874
Mom is a fair skin beauty.

47:15.166 --> 47:18.211
Should get going. Bye.

47:19.546 --> 47:24.050
Auntie has freckles,
She needs some care.

47:25.552 --> 47:27.929
Mom is a skin beauty.

47:27.929 --> 47:29.764
Auntie is a beauty of freckles.

47:29.848 --> 47:32.809
- What're you doing?
- Posting pictures on SNS.

47:32.809 --> 47:35.103
I never get to understand
the people doing SNS.

47:36.020 --> 47:36.938
Why not?

47:37.605 --> 47:40.817
Why are you trying to
disclose your privacy

47:40.817 --> 47:44.279
and share it with strangers?

47:50.201 --> 47:51.953
Did you drink last night?

47:52.662 --> 47:53.496
What?

47:55.623 --> 47:59.127
Yeah, briefly with the gang.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.713
You told me you ate dinner
that I prepared.

48:01.713 --> 48:05.592
Yes, I had it...

48:05.592 --> 48:10.221
when I got home early
after a drink with the gang.

48:11.556 --> 48:15.143
I see.
You came home early.

48:15.310 --> 48:16.603
Sure.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.189
How's your poem?

48:21.608 --> 48:25.445
It goes kinda okay.

48:26.529 --> 48:27.405
Sleep tight.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.086
Yes, ma'am.

48:44.964 --> 48:48.593
She's already good at
shadows and water.

48:49.177 --> 48:51.304
There's not much
I could advise on those.

48:54.474 --> 48:58.186
No reason for me treating
students unequally.

48:58.186 --> 49:00.730
What?

49:00.730 --> 49:01.940
Incentives?

49:03.149 --> 49:06.361
Oh, no.
I don't expect those.

49:07.737 --> 49:11.240
Well, I got your point.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.284
Gotta go as I have a class now.

49:15.787 --> 49:17.789
I'm not being impolite, ma'am.

49:19.374 --> 49:23.294
Hello? Ma'am?

49:23.878 --> 49:27.215
Hello? Hello!

49:49.737 --> 49:53.282
- Director talked a lot about you.
- You know him...

49:53.700 --> 49:55.994
Ms. OH, come in.

49:55.994 --> 49:59.872
This is Ms. YOO In-young
who studied the arts in France.

50:00.123 --> 50:02.583
She is a curator
at national gallery.

50:02.667 --> 50:05.545
I know.
We went college together.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.089
- Nice to see you again.
- What brought you here?

50:08.172 --> 50:11.134
She has a special lecture
for your class today.

50:11.134 --> 50:13.136
Please assist her.

50:16.097 --> 50:20.184
Do you like teaching kids?
Did you quit painting?

50:20.935 --> 50:22.603
Done with the painting?

50:23.938 --> 50:26.691
Well...

50:29.152 --> 50:31.946
Got it.
You should make a living.

50:36.034 --> 50:38.077
Can I ask you something?

50:39.662 --> 50:41.205
Are you still in touch
with Sung-woo?

50:42.290 --> 50:42.999
Who?

50:46.794 --> 50:49.797
It's so unexpected
to hear that name,

50:49.797 --> 50:52.467
especially from you.

50:52.467 --> 50:58.056
We broke up right away.

50:58.056 --> 51:00.224
He wanted to get back to you.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.479
Let's not talk about the past.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.398
You can find his details
on the Internet.

51:07.398 --> 51:09.025
He's staging a musical.

51:09.025 --> 51:11.152
Shall we go together?

51:11.152 --> 51:13.321
Would it be a little awkward?

51:14.322 --> 51:17.825
You can go if you like.
I don't feel like it.

51:18.576 --> 51:21.370

Hi, it's me.
Where are you?

52:09.085 --> 52:10.878
You're at in-laws'?

52:11.796 --> 52:14.966
I'm your mommy's friend.
Can I talk to her?

52:16.342 --> 52:18.261
Oh, she's with daddy.

52:19.053 --> 52:22.306
<i>The number you dialed is

52:23.724 --> 52:25.893
Roaming?

52:25.893 --> 52:27.186
Said she's penniless.

52:36.904 --> 52:38.072
Any style do you have in mind?

52:38.906 --> 52:43.619
Just make me look younger.

52:45.246 --> 52:46.747
Having a blind date?

52:49.083 --> 52:51.085
Nice.

52:51.836 --> 52:56.132
Are you free at 3PM today?

52:56.841 --> 52:57.717
Excuse me?

53:00.052 --> 53:01.262
No, nothing.

53:01.721 --> 53:02.930
Wait a minute.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.111
<i>Please leave a message

53:17.111 --> 53:18.988
What the...

53:19.697 --> 53:22.283
Why?
Someone's not answering?

53:22.783 --> 53:25.453
I can't reach my wife.

53:25.494 --> 53:27.079
She must be seeing
someone else.

53:28.414 --> 53:29.457
It was great, Sung-woo!

53:31.834 --> 53:33.502
Congratulations!

53:41.135 --> 53:43.930
- Do you have time to eat?
- Sure.

53:43.930 --> 53:46.307
- Let me treat you a dinner.
- No, let me.

53:47.141 --> 53:47.934
Thank you.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.398
I'll be right back, In-young.

53:55.775 --> 53:56.651
Mi-young!

54:43.239 --> 54:44.448
You are Mi-young, right?

54:45.324 --> 54:48.452
Hey, that's my mask!

54:51.372 --> 54:54.583
Thank god you're finally here!

54:54.583 --> 54:56.002
Why are you so late?

54:57.044 --> 54:58.045
Mi-young.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.635
Is that you, Sung-woo?

55:05.386 --> 55:06.429
What are you doing here?

55:06.887 --> 55:10.224
I'm working part time here.

55:10.224 --> 55:11.976
At this theatre?

55:12.852 --> 55:15.771
We can meet often then.
I'm staging a musical here.

55:15.771 --> 55:18.774
I just quit today.

55:18.774 --> 55:21.152
Oh... that was your musical.

55:21.235 --> 55:24.530
Why did you quit?

55:24.655 --> 55:28.909
- It wasn't my kind of stuff...
- Your kind...

55:29.618 --> 55:32.872
You haven't changed a bit.

55:33.748 --> 55:34.915
Stop flattering.

55:35.333 --> 55:38.377
My husband always complains
I'm changed.

55:38.669 --> 55:43.174
You're married?

55:45.217 --> 55:47.303
Is he good to you?

55:48.929 --> 55:51.807
Kind of...

55:51.807 --> 55:56.187
The first song of your musical,

55:56.187 --> 55:59.565
wasn't it the one you requested
to a radio program for me?

56:01.692 --> 56:03.778
Did I?

56:04.653 --> 56:08.115
But you said you haven't seen it.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.621
No, it's just...

56:13.621 --> 56:20.294
I could hear from outside.
The theatre must be old.

56:20.294 --> 56:23.130
Right...

56:28.928 --> 56:31.639
<i>What is the look on his face?</i>

56:32.348 --> 56:34.809
<i>Does he know I'm lying?</i>

56:34.809 --> 56:39.313
<i>Or is he looking at the freckles?
Should I come clean?</i>

56:40.314 --> 56:45.820
- Your nose is bleeding.
- What?

56:51.992 --> 56:53.244
Here it goes.

56:54.829 --> 56:56.872
You didn't have to do this.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.333
I remember
your nose did bleed often.

56:59.333 --> 57:01.836
Even several times a clay.

57:02.503 --> 57:06.215
Not anymore.
It's been 10 years since last time.

57:07.341 --> 57:10.302
Right, I remember.

57:10.302 --> 57:14.056
You rushed out to buy a T-shirt
saying my white blouse

57:14.056 --> 57:16.267
shouldn't get stained with blood.

57:17.184 --> 57:18.144
Did I?

57:19.019 --> 57:20.563
Don't you remember.

57:20.980 --> 57:25.109
You bought me a red one
to cover the blood color.

57:25.484 --> 57:29.238
I can't recall.
Maybe since it's been too long.

57:29.864 --> 57:34.368
Sure, it was long ago.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.121
I should go.

57:38.038 --> 57:40.624
Already? Hold on.

57:42.918 --> 57:43.836
This is my number.

57:44.003 --> 57:50.718
The show was great.
Way to go!

57:52.470 --> 57:53.888
You didn't see it, did you?

57:57.683 --> 58:01.687
I mean... it must be great!

58:13.407 --> 58:14.492
Hi, Eun-jung.

58:19.538 --> 58:23.417
I might start painting again.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.378
In-young asked me

58:27.046 --> 58:28.672
why I don't paint anymore.

58:29.465 --> 58:30.841
You know what?

58:31.717 --> 58:34.428
I thought I was painting.

58:35.763 --> 58:39.433
I considered myself painting
when I was only correcting kids'

58:40.476 --> 58:42.353
with that pencil in my hand.

58:42.353 --> 58:43.812
You can start it over.

58:44.855 --> 58:50.444
Sure... I can.
But I don't know what to draw.

58:53.239 --> 58:57.117
What's wrong?
Had a dispute with hubby?

59:00.871 --> 59:05.918
It became our routine.
We're arguing every clay.

59:06.710 --> 59:10.422
He might not like me
around him anymore.

59:11.632 --> 59:14.718
I don't seem to be
a big deal in his life.

59:15.761 --> 59:17.471
What's the issue?

59:18.806 --> 59:21.225
He's not buying you a red T-shirt
anymore when your nose bleeds?

59:23.185 --> 59:24.562
Right...

59:26.146 --> 59:30.359
It was him who bought it.

59:32.528 --> 59:35.698
How can you forget that?

59:36.240 --> 59:40.828
He even sent a song request
to the radio for you.

59:41.537 --> 59:42.580
Right.

59:42.580 --> 59:45.207
I didn't say it to you.
But I was so jealous!

59:45.874 --> 59:47.251
I must be crazy.

59:48.669 --> 59:49.753
Listen.

59:51.714 --> 59:56.802
I don't know about others. But you
surely are a big deal in my life.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:00.764
Thanks, my friend.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.028
Here it is.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.042
Thank you.

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:36.759
So long CHOI Sung-woo.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.928
I wish you best.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.145
Looks awful.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:52.691
I'm home.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:57.071
Why ramen?
I cooked you rice.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.573
Warming the stew
is that difficult for you?

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:01.533
Very kind of you.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:05.412
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.334
Where is the kimchi
that your mom brought last time?

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.628
That's why you called me?
For kimchi?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.215
Because you were being late.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:22.262
Also mom kept calling
to ask us to visit.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.765
The restaurant was too noisy
so I didn't hear it. Sorry.

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:28.394
So easy and simple.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.773
I left the memo saying I would
see the musical with Eun-jung.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:34.983
- You drank?
- Yes.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.527
Very nice and proper
for women till this late.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.405
Only with her?

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.741
What is wrong with you?

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.452
What would you think
if I pried into your privacy?

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.080
No use as I always
tell you everything.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.335
Good. Then where were you
when I slept at my mother's?

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:56.046
After you drank with your buddies.

01:01:57.965 --> 01:01:59.675
Don't remember.

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:02.928
How come?
It's only clays before.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.139
Landlady said...

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.932
you came home
almost at dawn.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.892
Unbelievable.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.311
Everyone in this block
is one big family!

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.440
Landlady checking
when the tenant comes home!

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:18.527
Then how about you?

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.779
- Huh?
- What about me?

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.906
You flirted with a stranger
in my presence!

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.825
- Hell, when?
- The clay...

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:26.577
we went to movies.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:29.747
You mean me talking to Jun-soo?
He's my colleague.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:31.665
How the hell should I know?

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.500
I introduced him to you.

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:36.545
And told you I taught him
when he was in high school.

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:38.005
He's just a kid.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.090
A kid is 6 ft. tall?

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:43.051
Then you must be still a kid
as your height is around 5 ft.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.219
5.7 to be exact.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:45.804
Let's call things off.
You're acting like a child.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.640
And don't change the subject.

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:53.061
Something happened that clay.
I can feel it.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.360
How many times I told you
to wash dishes when you're clone!

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.238
That's how other husbands do!

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:05.240
Then you should've married
with one of them!

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.226
Mi-young.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.232
Open the door please.

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:46.657
You say I smell of alcohol.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.575
- I should wash it off.
- But...

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:54.248
if you slam the door like that,
what should I feel?

01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:55.749
How about my feeling?

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.417
Have you ever thought of it?

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:04.716
You don't know how much
I tried to come home smiling.

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:12.266
What's happening to us lately?

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:18.730
It's too much for me to handle.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.109
Why are you acting like this?

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:25.404
Me? I think it's you!
What's wrong with you?

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:30.242
You need me only when
you eat and have sex.

01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:32.286
When you can't find kimchi!
That's when you need me!

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:33.871
Am I wrong?

01:04:47.843 --> 01:04:53.807
I got it.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:02.816
You're bleeding.

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.863
Let me see.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:15.787
What a temper...

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:19.291
My bad.
I'm sorry.

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:23.670
What have you clone wrong?

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.909
<i>CHOI SUNG-WOO</i>

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.264
He looks damn sly.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.405
Done with fighting?

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.663
I'm sorry being too noisy.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:42.874
No, I've got used to it now.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:47.838
I wish I had someone to argue with.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.590
By the way,
did anything happen?

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.509
No.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:56.096
It's always me.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:57.723
You got caught having an affair!

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.434
No way!

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:04.980
Please don't say that to her
even as a joke!

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:09.568
I won't! I don't poke into
other people's business.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.236
Then is it her having an affair?

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.113
No!

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:16.241
Then it's good.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.995
Good night, ma'am.

01:07:19.995 --> 01:07:25.625
You must've exhausted fighting.
Sleep well holding each other tight.

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.672
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:35.260
I believe the first love
really means to women?

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.889
Unforgettable...

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:43.185
Someone says there is
no one first love for women.

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:50.609
For a woman, the first love is
not the first man she loved

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:56.323
but the first memory of the man
she loves now.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.366
Just saying...

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.467
Where have you been?

01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:19.513
Did I wake you up?
Sorry.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.729
What happened to you today?

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:34.694
It surely was a strange clay.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:40.242
Your first love at the university...

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:43.203
the guy who did the theater.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:44.912
CHOI Sung-woo?

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.582
How did you two break up?

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.544
Why do you ask now?

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:54.214
I think you told me before
but cannot recall.

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:58.009
Maybe it can give me
some ideas for a poem.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.224
The new love came...

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.560
You know, I met you...

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.607
Then he came back saying
he wanted to turn everything back.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:16.153
What a fool.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.198
We were young.

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:23.868
Then?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.246
You know the story.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.542
I was in love with you.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:38.258
Mi-young.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.760
Why don't we go on a picnic?

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.138
To where?

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.432
Anywhere.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.768
- Anywhere?
- Yes.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:54.357
Anywhere... sounds good.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:21.968
<i>I LOVE YOU, MI-YOUNG</i>

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:24.888
The phone was not ringing at all

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:27.057
but I didn't suspect
I had no connection.

01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:31.478
The plug is too old and broken.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.521
I was worried so much!

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:37.067
I am sorry to make the busy one
to come all the way.

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:38.985
No way!

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.115
Golden wedding means
50th anniversary, right?

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:45.242
So impressive.

01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:48.828
But if we put aside the time
raising the children

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:53.124
and her staying sick in bed,
we didn't spend much together.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.835
Are these poetry books
all yours?

01:10:55.919 --> 01:11:00.590
Young generation nowadays
don't care the poetry.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:03.885
- Do you read some?
- Yes, I like them.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:08.682
You've got SHIM Je-hyu's collection?
Isn't it the first edition?

01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:14.062
This is so hard to get!
And RIMBAUD,

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:16.189
YEATS and DICKENS...

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.692
All very rare ones
as they are all out of print!

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.151
You can have them if you want.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:21.528
Do you mean it?

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:25.782
It would be great.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:30.120
But these are too precious...

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.832
Standing there alone
I finally realized the spring has come.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:40.422
Grandpa...

01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:47.304
Are you Mr. PAN Mok-won?
The poet?

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.055
- Well...
- Wow!

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.766
Grandpa... no, sir!

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:53.476
I am a huge fan of your works!

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.520
Don't call me that.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.358
It's my honor for you to recognize
my humble works.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:03.445
Oh my god.
I can't believe this!

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.660
Are you going to
grandpa PAN's house?

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.620
Sure, to get an advice for my work!

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:15.915
I think you're a nut!

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:17.250
What?

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.794
Writing poetry thing...
Can't believe it.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.259
Want to submit it
to the literary contest?

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:32.349
That's what I'm thinking
but I'm not sure if I'm qualified.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.477
Your poetry is good.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.270
Really?

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:43.318
But if the poem is too glamorous
or too complicated,

01:12:43.318 --> 01:12:45.403
it is difficult for the readers to get it.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.572
I put too many tricks, didn't I?

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.790
Jae-kyung was looking for you.

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:58.458
Why?

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.418
She said you hold her thing...

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:07.008
His birthday is tomorrow!

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:12.847
Wait.
I am sure I put it here.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.641
I didn't throw it away.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:17.185
How can I draw it all over?

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:22.732
Are you... crying?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.406
Do not draw my pimples.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.077
Focus on your study.

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.995
That's why I am doing this.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.666
It's you who lost it!

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.835
My bad, my bad.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.337
Don't be so difficult.

01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:48.675
It's been a while
since I completed something!

01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:56.182
Good luck
on your first love!

01:13:57.142 --> 01:13:58.768
Look! It's sea!

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:04.941
- Do you like it?
- It's been too long!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.777
Wasn't it a good idea
to come here?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.780
Good job on
renting a car too!

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.200
Thank you, honey.
I love you, Young-min!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.952
- I love you, Mi-young!
- I love it!

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.954
I love you, Mi-young.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:22.083
- The weather is great!
- Ta-da!

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:25.211
- What's this?
- I got it back in the parking lot.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.881
- Isn't it pretty?
- What happened to you?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.426
- Tell me it's pretty!
- How much did you pay?

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.888
Do you want to measure
one's heart with the price?

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:38.516
It's just I am allergic to metal.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:40.768
I can only wear gold or silver.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:45.064
Do you know
anything about me?

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:48.234
I know everything!
Your sight, sizes for shirts and pants,

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.903
and even cholesterol level!

01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:51.070
- I know something too.
- Then tell me!

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.906
Your breast is size A.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:59.120
- You think this is size A?
- Sure.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.916
From now on,

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:04.959
my breasts are the no-go area
for your hands!

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:08.171
It's like a death sentence to me!

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:18.473
- I've got a call.
- You've got a call?

01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:20.183
- Yes.
- Honey!

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:25.396
Hello.
Yes, speaking.

01:15:30.235 --> 01:15:31.528
Really?

01:15:34.322 --> 01:15:36.741
I see.
Thank you.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:44.999
What is it?

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.254
What?

01:15:49.254 --> 01:15:52.590
I am selected for
Modern Poetry New Figure Prize!

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:02.976
Sir!

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.145
Why are you outside...

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.232
You dress up so nicely today!

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:10.984
Want to take you
to the nice place.

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.319
Wow, it looks great!

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:16.990
Thank you!

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:18.783
Please pay in advance.

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.326
Oh, yes...

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:22.412
No, it's on me.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:23.162
Please...

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.539
Let me...!

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.463
Thank you.

01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:39.762
I wanted to take you to
a nice restaurant for celebration.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.974
No, I really wanted to have this!

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:45.310
Help yourself.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:50.023
You cannot imagine how much
I enjoyed talking to you.

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:55.653
You helped me writing
and also encouraged me a lot.

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:58.698
I was grateful
for you coming to see me.

01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:01.701
I will bother you much more
from now on!

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.369
My pleasure.

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:23.973
Now you're a poet.
So keep up the good work.

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:25.725
Yes.

01:17:27.018 --> 01:17:32.732
It's true that the life is a poem
and a poem is the cause of the life,

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:35.735
but do not let the poetry take away
what matters to you.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:39.989
Poetry exists for what's precious to you.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:43.993
That's what I feel now.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:51.084
Once my wife left me,
I had thoughts...

01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:03.096
First of all, I would like to
thank the jury

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:08.476
for giving me this great prize.
It's an honour.

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:10.728
And I believe you surely
have eyes for the poetry.

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:15.274
Receiving the award,
I questioned myself.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:19.278
The writers are
the seekers to realize

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.115
- Too tacky.
- the essence of everything.

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:23.491
It's not winning a Nobel Prize.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.410
Life and philosophy are...

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:27.453
Let's wear this.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.789
My sister sent this as a gift.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.667
It's a designer's brand!

01:18:33.126 --> 01:18:35.294
- Wow!
- Be careful.

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.754
I will do it myself.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:41.050
Shall we buy this house?

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.261
With what?

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:45.346
- With your cash prize, 3 grand?
- Who knows?

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:48.641
I could be the world renowned poet.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:53.312
Calm down.
And do not ever think of

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.690
quitting your job at the town office
saying you want to focus on writing.

01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:59.444
It's now called
as a community service center.

01:18:59.444 --> 01:19:01.154
- My apology.
- Apology accepted.

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:06.617
Preparing the speech
is tougher than writing poetry.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:09.662
GOETHE said...

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:16.377
a good poem becomes a song for children,
philosophy for the young,

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:19.839
and... the life for the old.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.509
Wow, clear Mi-young!

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:24.844
Please help me this.

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.053
I am impressed!

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.681
I did some research
as the wife of a poet.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:32.852
Yes, as you can see...

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.397
I live with this wonderful wife.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:38.941
I should enter the spring
literary contest next year!

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:39.984
Honey,

01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.111
how do I look?

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:44.655
Isn't it too much?
Your lips.

01:19:44.906 --> 01:19:47.867
It seems tacky
as it's too much.

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:50.369
The wife of a poet

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:53.372
should be elegant
and have some taste.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.124
I must not go.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:58.252
I don't feel like it actually.

01:19:58.252 --> 01:20:01.756
I know nothing about poetry
and feel awkward to go.

01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:05.343
Are you upset?
I just wanted to help you...

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:07.553
I am not.

01:20:10.807 --> 01:20:12.475
It's your mother.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.896
Hello!

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:19.899
Yes, I'm really proud of him.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:24.070
Yes, I will send you the picture of him

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:27.031
as soon as the ceremony is over!

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.908
- Bye.
- Bye, mom!

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:30.993
Let's go! Hurry!

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:34.914
I'm so nervous.
I don't know what it is.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:47.343
Water, please.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.804
Are you Ms. KIM Min-ju?

01:20:49.804 --> 01:20:52.223
No.

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:54.308
This table is only
for the award winners.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:57.770
- Sit at the back table.
- Sure.

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:12.785
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:16.539
How come he mistook me
for that old lady...

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.293
Young-min,
congratulations!

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:22.753
- Thank you.
- You look great.

01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:24.547
Let us begin
the Modern Literature Awards.

01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:29.594
First, let me announce
the winners for the poetry.

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:33.306
Runner-up for the poetry,
KIM Young-min.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:45.276
KIM Young-min!

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:49.739
Let's hear
the acceptance speech.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:52.491
Thank you.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:22:01.000
I don't know what the poem is yet...

01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:02.668
but GOETHE once said...

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:07.173
a good poem
becomes a song for children,

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:08.841
philosophy for the young,

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:14.597
and for the grown-ups...
no, for the old...

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:21.854
- Life.
- and the life for the old.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.900
I would try hard to write
a good poem like that.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:32.782
Lastly, I would like to dedicate this
to Poet PAN Mok-won,

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.371
who inspired
and helped me most.

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:42.249
Thank you.

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:48.464
Very nice!
Go Young-min!

01:22:48.756 --> 01:22:51.842
Great.
I need a hug too.

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:31.549
<i>MARRIAGE
BY KIM YOUNG-MIN</i>

01:23:31.549 --> 01:23:34.427
<i>AS THE SHARP NOISE WAKES ME UP,
THE DESPAIR OF BEING TWO SHEDS MY BLOOD.</i>

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.558
Why are you here?

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:44.020
It's too stuffy inside.
Wanted to get some fresh air.

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:45.730
Right, it was a bit hot.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.651
I guess you feel bad...

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:54.613
even if you understand it
as the artistic expression...

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:56.282
but the description of you
was awful.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:00.703
I am totally okay.

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:07.334
But I believe it is great
to be a subject for someone.

01:24:07.752 --> 01:24:11.922
What an artist.

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:16.802
Who do you think you are?
Push off!

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:48.834
I think you should get this.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:08.145
I think he got the heart attack
and has been dead for a few clays.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:10.523
Are you a social worker?

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.191
Yes.

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.152
Have you contacted his family?

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.450
There is no one to call...

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.717
<i>PI CHEON-DEUK</i>
ESSAYS

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:08.747
- Hey.
- I'm home.

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:10.082
How about dinner?

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:12.084
Not yet.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:16.589
Do you know any doctor?

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:18.924
My stomach's been
killing me lately.

01:26:35.024 --> 01:26:37.193
Dinner's ready.

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:38.527
Yeah.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.409
Try this.

01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:48.621
I found the recipe in the book.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.291
How is it?

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.294
Not for me.

01:26:56.754 --> 01:26:59.673
How is it?
I didn't put any seasoning.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:01.217
Just the grinded shrimps instead.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:05.471
Please put the seasoning!
Why not?

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:09.600
As it is not good for your health.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.352
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:14.355
Don't feel like eating actually.

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:19.526
Is it that urgent?
You should eat.

01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:20.819
Need to finish it
by tomorrow morning.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.988
It's for the Quarterly
of the city government.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.617
But you need to eat first...

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:44.218
Honey, I have a pain
in my stomach...

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.513
You think I should go
to see the doctor?

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.850
Do you hear me?

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.188
Now the idea is gone
as you keep talking to me!

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.550
Going out to get cigarette.
Need anything?

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:29.221
Young-min...

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:37.438
How dare...

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.318
Honey.

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:45.779
You shouldn't have
touched them

01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:50.826
if you didn't know
what these are.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.995
Or at least should've told me
once you moved them.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.246
I...

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:55.581
How could you...

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.043
You hate others

01:28:59.043 --> 01:29:01.253
moving your own stuffs!.

01:29:02.588 --> 01:29:05.049
You should've at least asked me

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:09.219
or shouldn't have touched them at all!

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:12.723
Why are you so arbitrary?
It's not garbage!

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:16.727
- How dare you!
- Please, Young-min...

01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:39.083
<i>Hello, Mi-young.</i>

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:42.044
- Ma...
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:48.801
- Please help!
<i>- Mi-young!</i>

01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:50.719
<i>What happened?
Tell me!</i>

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:51.804
<i>Oh, my, what is wrong?</i>

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:55.015
<i>Are you alone?
Where is your husband?</i>

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:00.479
<i>Mi-young, please...</i>

01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.663
Ms. OH Mi-young's guardian?

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:21.542
- Ms. OH's guardian?
- Here!

01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:29.091
It's fibroid.

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:38.350
Fibroid?

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:41.478
She got lots of
cysts in her womb...

01:30:42.688 --> 01:30:44.857
but it's quite usual for many women.

01:30:44.857 --> 01:30:47.359
But in Ms. OH's case,
she needs to get the surgery

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:48.652
as the cyst is in the bad location.

01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:53.907
A surgery?
Isn't it dangerous?

01:30:53.991 --> 01:30:57.369
No, but it would be really painful.
And she cannot eat, either.

01:30:58.829 --> 01:30:59.705
Young-min.

01:31:01.457 --> 01:31:03.000
Mother.

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:07.754
Take her to the laboratory

01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:09.548
while I am doing the registration.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.468
- I won't go with him.
- What is with you?

01:31:12.468 --> 01:31:15.220
- I just don't want that.
- Don't act like a child.

01:31:16.263 --> 01:31:20.142
Oh my, I left my bag
at the ER.

01:31:24.188 --> 01:31:25.063
Are you okay?

01:31:37.367 --> 01:31:38.994
Feeling better?

01:31:40.454 --> 01:31:43.624
- Leave before mom returns.
- How can I?

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.918
Go finish your great poem.

01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:54.426
I was sensitive back then...

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:57.387
I am sensitive too.

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:07.314
You should've told me
when you were sick.

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:12.611
Like I didn't?

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:18.659
Can we call this a marriage?

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:24.289
Why do we live together?
Feeling ill at ease.

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:27.292
Feeling ill?

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:43.016
- I want to give it a second thought.
- To what?

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:46.228
To everything.

01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:53.569
- I can't live like this.
- What do you want to say?

01:32:54.653 --> 01:32:58.824
It hurts me so bad
and also I feel embarrassed.

01:33:00.826 --> 01:33:01.827
So you are telling me

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:04.496
you want a divorce or what?

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:08.333
Why not?

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:09.918
You...

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:20.721
We'll talk more later.

01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:25.017
Get out of here.

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:55.547
<i>SURGERY IS DAY AFTER TMR
SO COME BY TMR AFTER WORK.</i>

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:05.515
<i>I AM ON MY DAUGHTER'S SIDE.</i>

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:20.113
Yes, mom.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:23.033
I came home just now.

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:28.413
No, I need to do some work first...

01:34:29.414 --> 01:34:34.378
She needs underwear and lip balm...
Lip what?

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.297
Why needs a lip balm
in the hospital?

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:39.466
I'll bring them.

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:45.097
It'd be difficult in the morning.
I will stop by after work.

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:49.518
Good night.

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:00.529
Mi-young, coffee please.

01:35:34.563 --> 01:35:35.772
<i>You must be Mr. NA Jun-o.</i>

01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:39.776
Sorry I'm late.
The traffic was so bad.

01:35:40.026 --> 01:35:41.278
Nice to meet you.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:47.075
No way. It's fine.

01:35:49.536 --> 01:35:52.456
I was reading a book
so I wasn't bored at all.

01:35:52.581 --> 01:35:55.917
Which book?

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:57.377
This?

01:35:57.377 --> 01:36:01.757
The collection of poems
by Reiner Maria RILKE.

01:36:01.757 --> 01:36:03.675
By any chance,
do you like RILKE?

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:10.682
I'm not that easy. It takes time
for me to fall for someone.

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:15.145
I see.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.650
Sky-blue goes well with you.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:24.946
Is this called sky-blue?

01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:26.865
Yes, it looks good on you.

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:29.868
Thank you.

01:36:37.876 --> 01:36:39.085
Shall we go out?

01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:40.128
Pardon?

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:43.048
I know a nice Italian restaurant
in this neighborhood.

01:36:43.048 --> 01:36:46.134
And I'm starving.
Do you mind having pasta for lunch?

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.054
- Well... I don't...
- Let's go now.

01:36:51.014 --> 01:36:52.224
- Now?
- Yes.

01:36:52.224 --> 01:36:53.433
- You mean right now?
- Sure.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.393
- Going out?
- Yes, this way.

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:15.372
- What kind of pasta do you like?
- Me? I like Aglio...

01:37:15.372 --> 01:37:16.373
Young-min.

01:37:16.373 --> 01:37:18.542
- Ogli... I like Aglio e Ogli...
- Right.

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:22.254
Are you holding my hand?

01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:24.506
Yes, I am quite short-tempered.

01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:25.924
Me too!

01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:28.760
You do?
Please hurry.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.095
- Why do we run?
- It's just... Let me carry your bag!

01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:32.347
Young-min!
What is it?

01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:36.434
Are you okay?
Wait for me!

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:38.228
Damn it is hot!

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:51.074
<i>THE DAY HE SURPRISED ME WITH A PROPOSAL.
LET'S LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER!</i>

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:00.500
You want to break up?

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:03.628
Is it what you want?

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:09.134
Then why did you say that?

01:38:09.634 --> 01:38:12.429
You should've told me not to
if I said I wanted a break-up.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.390
You're over thirty
and still don't know that?

01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:18.476
Then what shall you say
when you really want to break up?

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:23.815
Don't know.
Since it would never happen.

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:36.036
I just meant
that I was lonely.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:43.835
Being lonely doesn't mean
that you are alone.

01:38:44.044 --> 01:38:48.757
It's really scary that you feel lonely
when you are with someone.

01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:52.677
It's true that the life is a poem
and a poem is the cause of the life,

01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:56.056
but do not let the poetry take away
what matters to you.

01:38:56.056 --> 01:38:59.684
<i>Poetry exists for what's precious to you.</i>

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.237
Hi, Eun-jung.

01:39:13.198 --> 01:39:19.162
<i>Mr. PAN was the doyen of poets</i>

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:23.750
<i>who our community service center
took care of.</i>

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:26.544
<i>He was really kind...</i>

01:39:28.964 --> 01:39:30.799
<i>He even treated me the rice soup.</i>

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:42.894
<i>He was... I'm sorry.</i>

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.080
Give me your hand.

01:40:03.623 --> 01:40:07.711
Gosh, it's cold.

01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:47.208
It's hot.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.960
Are you hurt?

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.296
- Please bring some water!
- Why is it so hot?

01:40:51.296 --> 01:40:52.547
Are you okay?

01:42:10.959 --> 01:42:14.212
- What are you doing?
- I was just passing by.

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.424
At this early hour?

01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:21.469
Yes...

01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:28.726
Your bed was...

01:42:29.853 --> 01:42:32.230
Someone moved out.
It's better by the window.

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:33.231
I see.

01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:36.693
- You feel better now?
- Yes.

01:42:38.111 --> 01:42:39.487
I didn't know

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:42.407
what you were going through.

01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:52.083
That's what I wanted to say.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.131
- But I said it first.
- I should've...

01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:00.717
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:04.637
I am sorry.

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:09.058
I really...

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:15.023
Really what?

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:29.287
I love you, Mi-young.

01:43:36.336 --> 01:43:40.965
It took you so long to say it?

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:46.930
I'm your first love.

01:43:49.432 --> 01:43:53.144
Yes, you are.

01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:03.571
There's something
I wanted to show you.

01:44:18.503 --> 01:44:19.337
What do you think?

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.270
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, very pretty.

01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:49.909
Won't let go of your hand.
I will try harder.

01:45:05.216 --> 01:45:06.718
I love you, Mi-young.

01:45:09.095 --> 01:45:10.847
I love you, too,
Young-min.

01:45:29.991 --> 01:45:33.411
How long do I have to wait?
Please!

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:39.250
Hold on just a little longer.
Wait a bit more, my sweetie.

01:45:40.752 --> 01:45:41.836
What should I do?

01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:45.840
Well, let me hold him.

01:45:51.596 --> 01:45:53.765
Ain't I great?

01:45:55.141 --> 01:45:55.975
Yes.

01:45:56.768 --> 01:45:59.937
<i>Can anyone know what love is
when he talks about love?</i>

01:46:00.772 --> 01:46:04.150
<i>How much more love
do we need to define love?</i>

01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:08.613
<i>We kept arguing
after that winter...</i>

01:46:08.613 --> 01:46:10.448
<i>also kept saying
'I love you.'</i>

01:46:11.324 --> 01:46:13.117
<i>I still don't know what love is.</i>

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:16.704
<i>But I just want to say it
over and over every day.</i>

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:19.749
<i>I love you, Mi-young.</i>

01:46:22.126 --> 01:46:24.879
<i>I am... getting married...</i>

01:46:30.176 --> 01:46:32.011
Congrat.
Sorry, I'm busy.

01:46:32.011 --> 01:46:33.805
<i>Damn, the kid is crying.
Send the invitation.</i>

01:46:33.805 --> 01:46:35.139
......

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:36.516
How could you do this to me?

01:46:37.266 --> 01:46:37.475
<i>Ki-tae left the chatting room.</i>

01:46:37.475 --> 01:46:37.809
<i>Jung-jin left the chatting room.</i>

01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:38.976
<i>Young-min left the chatting room.</i>

01:47:24.272 --> 01:47:25.523
You look so pure today.

01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:31.696
I never felt like this

01:47:31.696 --> 01:47:33.573
since I graduated high school.

01:47:34.866 --> 01:47:36.951
You look more innocent
being so quiet.
