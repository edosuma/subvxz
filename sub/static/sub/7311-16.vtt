00:11.000 --> 00:12.726
Sir, you find your friend?

00:12.750 --> 00:14.700
Yes, I did, thanks.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.796
Checking out.

00:48.820 --> 00:50.506
Name, sir?

00:50.530 --> 00:53.090
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

01:29.740 --> 01:31.260
Good morning, Tony.

01:35.490 --> 01:36.220
No.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.446
I haven't seen that bad boy in a while.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.300
You had a rough night?

01:41.760 --> 01:44.176
- Yes.
- Yes, the people from Tokyo.

01:44.200 --> 01:50.000
A few of our counterparts were visiting from
Japan; Director Vance had Tony show them around.

01:50.030 --> 01:51.296
Sake bombs.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.856
I see.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.126
I barely made it out of there alive.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.406
And now you hope to finishhe job.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.980
McGee, say words.

02:00.450 --> 02:03.810
What you see before you, Ziva,
is The DiNozzo Defibrillator.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.326
It's been passed down
through six generations.

02:06.350 --> 02:11.150
My family also has a hangover
remedy... jasmine tea with lime.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.210
That's disgusting.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.706
Remind me never to have
a hangover in Israel.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.900
DiNozzo.

02:16.930 --> 02:18.496
Not that I have a hangover now, boss.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.626
You know I would never
drink on a school night.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.280
Where were you last night?

02:22.310 --> 02:23.426
Drinking.

02:23.450 --> 02:24.490
You alone?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.350
Of course not.

02:27.220 --> 02:32.220
Not that there's anything wrong with drinking
bourbon alone in your basement... with a boat.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.990
What were we talking about?

02:36.020 --> 02:38.070
Your alibi.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.850
My alibi? For what?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.366
Who would want to impersonate Tony?

02:46.390 --> 02:48.166
Perhaps Jack Nicholson.

02:48.190 --> 02:51.150
You know, impersonation revenge.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.916
Or it's a frame-up.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.600
Jeanne Benoit?

02:56.220 --> 02:58.666
Overseas. Maybe it was Trent Kort.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.066
Are you detecting a trend here?

03:01.090 --> 03:03.740
Tony does have a way with people.

03:04.340 --> 03:07.350
The seam split. I can't believe it.

03:11.940 --> 03:15.086
I know. Discarded like a piece of trash.

03:15.110 --> 03:18.336
No, I meant the duffel bag.
I just bought the same one.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.400
Should have listened to the reviews...
They said the seams were a problem.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.450
McGee, the man is folded in half.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.670
I know. No, that... it...
that's, uh, you know, a shame, too.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.400
Maybe I've been doing this too long.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.810
Well, that's my name. It's not
my signature, but that's my name.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.950
And to think, I almost made it an entire
year without being accused of murder.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.506
The guy did look a lot like you.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.800
Not helping.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.010
Was a little more fit, though.

03:53.810 --> 03:55.506
- We're gonna need...
- Security tapes.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.010
- And...
- Key to Room 742. Here you go.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.270
In a bit of a rush?

04:00.310 --> 04:03.000
Actually, yes; I'd like to
move this off the floor.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.260
The Rosewood has a reputation to uphold.

04:05.290 --> 04:09.010
If there's anything else
you need, please let me know.

04:09.390 --> 04:12.420
Yeah. We will.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.390
Come on.

04:15.890 --> 04:20.125
Funny, when I woke up this morning, those
last four shots seemed like a bad idea.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.710
Don't need an alibi with me, DiNozzo.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.650
I'm glad you got one, though.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.086
Makes two of us.

04:26.110 --> 04:30.600
Haven't seen anything quite
like this since Vegas, '99.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.760
Cirque du Soleil.

04:32.790 --> 04:36.190
Uh, Mother and I caught
two shows in one evening.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.600
She's an admirer, to say the least.

04:38.630 --> 04:39.730
Aren't we all?

04:39.760 --> 04:41.380
Not like my mother.

04:41.410 --> 04:45.610
She had an infatuation for one of
the tumblers for quite some time.

04:45.650 --> 04:47.630
Marc or Ignacio?

04:49.270 --> 04:52.516
Yeah, I-I've followed Ignacio's
career for some time, and he was...

04:52.540 --> 04:54.550
Why don't you quit while
you're behind, Palmer?

04:54.580 --> 04:56.566
Quitting, sir. I will go get the gurney.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.366
Victim's Lieutenant Justin Grady.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.760
Works out of the Department of Defense.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.130
Grady?

05:02.160 --> 05:03.870
You know him?

05:03.910 --> 05:05.300
Sounds familiar.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.850
Now that you mention it,
he kind of looks familiar.

05:08.550 --> 05:09.610
What did he do?

05:09.640 --> 05:14.410
Currently stationed as an Adjunct Supervisor
in DoD's International Mail Gateway.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.060
So he's a mailman?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.816
Wasa mailman.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.966
You got a cause of death, Duck?

05:18.990 --> 05:22.620
This cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.

05:22.650 --> 05:26.176
That, combined with this ligature mark...

05:26.200 --> 05:29.756
- Strangled?
- Yeah. With a wire or cord.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.176
And then...

05:31.200 --> 05:34.150
to finish him off, they
stabbed him through the heart.

05:34.190 --> 05:38.210
Preliminary measurement shows
a three-to four-inch blade.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.620
Nothing in the alley.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.940
Room is clear, too.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.946
Well, you would know. It is your room.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.996
Way to kick a man when
he's down, McBackstabber.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.106
- Ziva, witnesses?
- Two.

05:48.130 --> 05:51.406
A maid and a businessman
who was rather inebriated.

05:51.430 --> 05:54.330
They both got clear looks
at the occupant of the room.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.126
Matches Tony's description.

05:56.150 --> 05:58.630
Okay, that's it. I'm out of here.

06:00.310 --> 06:02.676
Maybe we should go easy on him.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.086
Think he'd go easy on us?

06:05.110 --> 06:07.220
Excellent point.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.200
Remember me?

06:28.610 --> 06:30.336
Renny Grant.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.996
Civilian. Worked out of the Pentagon.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.500
My first collar as boss, three years ago,
when you took your Mexican sabbatical.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.196
Intermission?

06:40.220 --> 06:41.970
It was a hiatus really.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.466
Embezzlement.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.390
Right.

06:46.510 --> 06:50.140
Renny was accused of stealing over a
million bucks from a Navy credit union.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.370
Got a witness to testify against him.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.720
Open-and-shut case.

06:59.230 --> 07:00.830
Sort of.

07:00.860 --> 07:01.660
Well, the only thing is, we never...

07:01.690 --> 07:02.896
- found the money.
- Found the money.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.400
Nah, not so open and shut.

07:05.890 --> 07:07.776
- Not really.
- No.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.250
That happens sometimes.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.250
To the rest of us.

07:13.710 --> 07:15.820
Judge sentenced Renny to five years.

07:15.860 --> 07:18.436
Got supervised release three months ago.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.986
And that coworker who testified...

07:21.010 --> 07:22.516
Lieutenant Justin Grady.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.330
Yeah. Our dead guy.

07:24.690 --> 07:27.840
Well, nothing like a good revenge
killing to kick off the week.

07:32.130 --> 07:33.876
You miss me, Ren? Is that it?

07:33.900 --> 07:35.636
Just couldn't stay away?

07:35.660 --> 07:37.250
Missed a lot of things.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.850
My family... my girl...

07:40.430 --> 07:42.206
a nice prime rib Madeira.

07:42.230 --> 07:43.850
You, not so much.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.820
Yeah. Well, here you are.

07:47.710 --> 07:50.120
And nothing's changed,
except for the gray hair.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.970
Hey, show a little respect.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.090
His name's Special Agent Gibbs.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.446
Actually, I was talking about you.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.446
I think I see a few sprouting.

07:58.470 --> 08:00.330
I got a few gray hairs myself.

08:00.370 --> 08:03.516
Three years. It's a long time.

08:03.540 --> 08:07.210
Of course, in an eight-by-ten
cell, feels more like 30.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.876
That why you killed the
guy who put you there?

08:08.900 --> 08:10.080
Looking for payback?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.080
I didn't kill anybody.

08:12.510 --> 08:16.056
So, Lieutenant Grady stuffed
himself into a duffel bag.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.830
I want to talk to Agent DiNozzo. Alone.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.166
Doesn't work that way.

08:23.190 --> 08:24.976
I came to you.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.150
And I didn't have to.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.910
Coffee.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.035
Coffee machine in the next room there?

08:35.059 --> 08:36.806
He's gone. Talk.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.416
- I'm innocent.
- You said that.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.929
Of the embezzlement charges.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.145
You said that, too.

08:41.169 --> 08:41.980
I can prove it.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.770
I'm more interested in why the star witness
from your case showed up in your duffel bag.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.830
He wouldn't fit in my Samsonite.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.446
Keep it up. Juries love a smart-ass.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.140
But of course, you must rember that.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.336
I didn't kill Lieutenant Grady.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.950
I just wanted to talk to him.

09:00.990 --> 09:03.136
Really? About what?

09:03.160 --> 09:07.286
We were friends, and
he testified against me.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.880
I had to find out why.

09:10.130 --> 09:16.086
Grady wouldn't see me, but I knew he'd agree to
see Agent DiNozzo, lead investigator on the case.

09:16.110 --> 09:18.950
So I set up a meeting at the Rosewood.

09:18.980 --> 09:22.766
I checked in early, went out to eat...

09:22.790 --> 09:26.416
and when I got back,
Grady was dead on my floor.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.166
I don't know what
happened. I swear to God.

09:29.190 --> 09:30.320
I panicked.

09:30.350 --> 09:32.180
I hid the body and got
the hell out of there.

09:32.220 --> 09:35.100
I screwed up. That's why I'm here.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.560
The judge sentenced you to
five years for embezzlement.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.260
Yeah. I remember.

09:43.770 --> 09:46.170
Too bad I didn't have this.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.610
What's that, a good luck charm?

09:49.650 --> 09:53.460
It's a USB drive with a paper
trail that proves I was innocent.

09:53.490 --> 09:56.276
Took me three years to dig it all up.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.526
Thanks to you, I had the time.

09:58.550 --> 10:01.180
The appeals court won't even look at it.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.606
I figured you might be able to help me.

10:03.630 --> 10:06.126
It is the least you can do.

10:06.150 --> 10:09.070
Well, I'll see if I can get around to it.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.560
I don't know if you've heard, but I am
in the middle of a murder investigation.

10:16.370 --> 10:17.840
Don't believe a word he says.

10:17.870 --> 10:20.180
We got motive. We got opportunity.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.536
I know. Why'd he come back?

10:22.560 --> 10:25.046
That's a good question, boss.

10:25.070 --> 10:27.050
Boss?

10:27.610 --> 10:29.780
Was your case, wasn't it?

10:31.980 --> 10:34.110
Yeah.

10:35.590 --> 10:37.816
You're not going back to Mexico, are you?

10:37.840 --> 10:40.290
Your case, you're lead.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.590
- Really?
- Yeah. I think it's even a rule.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.290
There.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.530
All right, zooming in.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.460
That's Renny Grant.

10:53.490 --> 10:56.536
But he didn't check out of the
hotel till three hours later.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.840
- So, where is he going?
- Dinner.

10:59.370 --> 11:00.776
Or so he says.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.690
What have we got?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.356
Our suspect. All over
Rosewood's surveillance video.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.060
But no sign yet of our victim.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.246
- Keep looking. McGee...
- What?

11:09.270 --> 11:12.780
Victim's background. Credit
cards, bank statements.

11:13.110 --> 11:15.216
Gibbs. Take a look at Renny's appeal.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.530
Use it to catch yourself up on the original
embezzlement case, then work with McGee.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.990
On it, boss.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.816
- Are you going back to Mexico?
- No.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.470
Rule number 38.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.150
Yeah. Gibbs.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.890
Yeah. On my way, Abs.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.750
Caf-POW! Right.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.360
Talk to me, Abs. Here you go.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.886
- Thank you, Gibbs.
- Abby...

11:59.910 --> 12:03.626
I was just examining the evidence
from the murder scene, Gibbs.

12:03.650 --> 12:04.556
Abby...

12:04.580 --> 12:07.280
The room was luckily really clean,
because, you know, hotel rooms,

12:07.320 --> 12:10.230
they can be a forensic scientist's
biggest nightmare, Gibbs.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.020
Abby! I'm not Gibbs.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.536
Yes, you are. Because, if
you're not, there's a problem.

12:17.560 --> 12:22.470
And after Sister Rosita spraing her ankle in
the sixth frame and Mr. Giggles escaping...

12:22.510 --> 12:23.256
Mr. Giggles?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.910
Stay on topic, Gibbs.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.220
Not Gibbs.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.656
Okay, tell me. I can take it.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.550
- Well, he's just upstairs...
- Wait.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.700
I can't.

12:33.730 --> 12:35.570
Rule 38.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.930
So, um, I processed the evidence
from the crime scene... Tony...

12:41.970 --> 12:44.170
And nothing contradicts
your initial assessment.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.686
Lieutenant Grady entered Renny's
room. There was a short struggle.

12:46.710 --> 12:47.486
Broken lamp.

12:47.510 --> 12:49.726
During the scuffle,
they fell onto the bed.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.526
Bloody pillow.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.730
Where Lieutenant Grady was
strangled and stabbed to death.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.220
I found Grady's blood on the comforter.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.600
I don't want to tell
you what else I found.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.030
Yeah, you do.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.370
Oh, you know me so well.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.340
But that's gonna have to wait for later,
because I am cooking up some awesomeness.

13:05.370 --> 13:06.796
Awesome me.

13:06.820 --> 13:11.136
I ran the swabs that you took from the sink,
and I found traces of sodium tallowate,

13:11.160 --> 13:13.360
water and fragrance.

13:15.210 --> 13:18.620
- Soap! Gibbs would have known that.
- Right.

13:18.990 --> 13:24.266
I can also tell by the chemical decomposition
that the sink was usedafterGrady was murdered.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.506
Killer washed his hands.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.686
And...

13:28.710 --> 13:31.096
left a partial fingerprint.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.690
It's degraded by the soap, so I
can't run it through any databases,

13:34.720 --> 13:37.780
but I should be able to pull enough
from it to incriminate a suspect.

13:37.810 --> 13:40.700
Well, we got one of those. Let me
know as soon as you're done. Now...

13:41.650 --> 13:43.920
who is Mr. Giggles?

13:45.450 --> 13:47.600
Back to work, DiNozzo.

13:48.010 --> 13:50.800
I hope I don't have to
train him all over again.

13:52.350 --> 13:55.056
So Tony is in charge again.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.980
Yes.

13:57.290 --> 13:59.300
How do you feel about it?

13:59.330 --> 14:04.240
Tony is a competent, capable
investigator and a good leader.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.746
You do not agree?

14:07.770 --> 14:10.210
No, I agree. It's just...

14:11.300 --> 14:13.950
he's kind of irritating
when he'snotthe boss.

14:13.980 --> 14:19.650
When he is, he walks around with that
peacock strut, that smirk. It's like...

14:21.520 --> 14:23.376
He's behind me, isn't he?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.450
Smirking.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.926
That's good timing... how long
were you waiting back there?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.166
Two minutes.

14:29.190 --> 14:30.706
Ziva, any luck with
the surveillance video?

14:30.730 --> 14:32.890
I finally found our
victim, Lieutenant Grady.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.496
He entered through a...

14:34.520 --> 14:36.316
- Service entrance.
- Yes.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.226
Nearly two hours before he was killed.

14:38.250 --> 14:41.900
I spoke again to the floor maid, and
she admits letting him into Renny's room.

14:41.930 --> 14:43.850
Claimed he lost his key?

14:43.890 --> 14:46.270
McGee, stroke my plumage.

14:47.570 --> 14:50.740
Well, uh, nothing unusual in
Lieutenant Grady's bank statements,

14:50.770 --> 14:53.640
but I did find a sealed
file in his records.

14:53.670 --> 14:57.610
Well, some of his testimony in Renny's embezzlement
case did involve classified information.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.476
Just to be sure, I'm petitioning
the judge for access.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.440
Nice work, team.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.696
I'm proud of you. We're sitting pretty.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.510
Pretty as a...

15:07.720 --> 15:09.626
Peacock?

15:09.650 --> 15:12.950
Oh, hey, boss. Uh, Jethro.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.366
Did you catch up on
Renny's embezzlement case?

15:15.390 --> 15:18.256
Yes. And I went through his appeal.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.470
Let me guess: Wasted
three years of his life.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.580
No, you did.

15:23.870 --> 15:26.130
Kid was innocent.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.970
The original case
hinged on computer logs.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.396
Showed Renny embezzling
from a base credit union.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.100
First National.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.606
Using the latest open
source forensic software,

15:47.630 --> 15:51.090
Renny dug up evidence that
those logs were falsified.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.360
Yeah, but it turns out Renny wasn't even
in the country when the money was stolen.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.660
Where?

15:56.700 --> 15:58.086
Iraq.

15:58.110 --> 16:02.220
Since the computer Renny supposedly
did the embezzling with was on base...

16:02.250 --> 16:03.676
I get it, McGee. The guy didn't do it.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.390
He raises bunnies and grew
rainbows, and I put him in prison.

16:09.790 --> 16:12.916
Come on. Think.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.030
Campfire.

16:18.930 --> 16:20.770
Gibbs.

16:22.630 --> 16:24.860
Huddle up.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.890
Thank you.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.060
Okay... Renny didn't steal the money.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.690
That's my bad.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.170
But it doesn't let him off the
hook killing Lieutenant Grady.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.326
Not at all. It was Grady's
testimony that put him away.

16:44.350 --> 16:45.810
False testimony.

16:45.860 --> 16:47.310
Insult to injury.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.426
So, if anything, Renny's motive
for murder just got stronger.

16:51.450 --> 16:53.540
What is our dead guy's motive?

16:53.570 --> 16:56.846
Lied on the witness stand
three years ago. Why?

16:56.870 --> 16:58.630
Maybe he was the real embezzler.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.360
Used Renny as his fall guy.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.556
Sounds like a theory.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.740
Now we just need to prove it.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.856
- Yes?
- Jethro, come down a moment.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.415
- Oh, hey, Ducky.
- Tony?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.520
Yeah, I'll be right down.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.869
Keep it.

17:22.970 --> 17:25.486
Ziva, I want all the transcripts
from Renny's embezzlement trial.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.099
McGee, interviews.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.540
If he worked with him,
you're talking to him.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.100
Gibbs.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.040
Good campfire.

17:40.570 --> 17:45.446
Congratulations on your
promotion, Anthony, fleeting as it may be.

17:45.470 --> 17:47.606
Thanks, Ducky.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.990
Actually, I'm, uh, off to a rough start.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.306
Hope you got something good for me.

17:51.330 --> 17:54.916
Yes, well, I found some anomalies
on Lieutenant Grady's body.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.600
First, note this pernicious
rash on his lower extremities.

17:58.630 --> 17:59.270
Lovely.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.130
It continues up his back,
erupting into blisters.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.210
Some nasty blisters.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.790
I have a sample for
you to see, if you like.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.890
I'll take your word for it.

18:09.920 --> 18:15.490
Agent Gibbs never passes up the opportunity
of enjoying the fruits of my labor.

18:22.760 --> 18:27.760
Yeah, his X-rays showed nodules
on both his upper and lower lobes.

18:27.810 --> 18:33.030
At first, I thought they might be cancerous
lesions, but combined with the rash...

18:33.060 --> 18:34.906
Valley fever.

18:34.930 --> 18:37.526
Very good, Anthony. How did you know...

18:37.550 --> 18:41.076
Long story. Let's just say I'm not
going back to Arizona anytime soon.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.706
Yes. I feel the same
way about Stronachlachar.

18:44.730 --> 18:50.560
As you are no doubt aware, valley fever is
native to the southwest of the United States.

18:50.590 --> 18:54.110
The lieutenant must have spent
some time there, and recently.

18:54.150 --> 18:55.340
Thanks, Ducky.

18:55.370 --> 18:58.226
That's not why I called you down here.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.820
Valley fever is aptly named.

19:00.850 --> 19:05.770
Lieutenant Grady would have had a slight
fever when he died... most assuredly...

19:05.800 --> 19:08.646
Which would alter my
initial time of death.

19:08.670 --> 19:10.320
By how much?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.140
Two hours prior.

19:12.170 --> 19:15.100
That would put time of
death around 8:30 p.m.?

19:15.130 --> 19:16.360
Is that a problem?

19:16.400 --> 19:21.020
Yeah, it is, because Renny Grant
was having dinner at 8:30 p.m.,

19:21.070 --> 19:23.360
and I've got a dozen
witnesses to prove it.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.840
Then your murder suspect
is no longer a suspect.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.420
Renny.

19:36.350 --> 19:38.500
Give us a minute.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.416
I am sorry.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.430
Just so I'm straight, what's that for?

19:47.690 --> 19:51.496
Putting me in prison or
accusing me of murder?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.836
Prison. I think we're
even on the murder thing.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.120
You did drop a body down a trash chute.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.480
Good thing my probation's up.

20:00.510 --> 20:03.250
What am I looking at anyway for
tampering with a crime scene?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.766
Well, it's gonna be up to the judge.

20:04.790 --> 20:07.726
If you're lucky, time served.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.910
And my appeal?

20:11.990 --> 20:13.236
I'll write you a letter.

20:13.260 --> 20:15.990
Better be a hell of a letter.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.600
I promise it will be.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.196
Who set you up, Renny?

20:25.220 --> 20:27.700
Can you prove that it
was Lieutenant Grady?

20:28.220 --> 20:30.616
Already proved I didn't do it.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.730
And now you expect me
to find the guy who did.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.840
What exactly areyougonna do?

20:38.140 --> 20:42.370
- Renny.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't leave town. I know the drill.

20:55.190 --> 20:57.446
- Tony.
- You answered the wrong phone, didn't you?

20:57.470 --> 20:58.766
- What, McGee?
- Wilkins is here.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.876
Well, just tell him you're
handling the interviews.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.306
Well, he asked for you.

21:02.330 --> 21:05.740
Do I have to do everything?
All right, I'll be right up.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.640
Told you so.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.040
I've been waiting
three years to say that.

21:17.570 --> 21:20.216
How's life in the Pentagon, Mitch?

21:20.240 --> 21:22.510
You pulled a Shawshank.

21:22.540 --> 21:23.800
You put the wrong guy away.

21:23.830 --> 21:25.090
Weput the wrong guy away.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.906
As I recall, you were his supervisor.

21:26.930 --> 21:29.516
Hey, I just discovered
the money was missing.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.186
Told you from the
beginning Renny was framed.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.620
He didn't have the computer skills...

21:36.030 --> 21:38.166
He does now.

21:38.190 --> 21:40.860
Worked on his appeal in the can.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.776
How's Ziva?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.490
Ziva?

21:47.880 --> 21:50.540
- Why?
- I haven't seen her in a while.

21:51.450 --> 21:52.850
Three years.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.300
- Yeah, right, of course.
- Closer to two.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.720
When she added me as
a friend on Facebook.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.756
Ziva's on Facebook?

21:59.780 --> 22:01.590
You ever see her knife collection?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.530
Ooh-rah.

22:04.510 --> 22:05.936
You've been to her place?

22:05.960 --> 22:08.070
It was a double-team.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.356
The embezzlement.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.000
Never could figure how it was done.

22:13.030 --> 22:15.260
Looks like Renny did.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.356
Access logs were faked.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.726
And with our security
systems, that's no easy task.

22:20.750 --> 22:25.720
Would have needed at least two people... one to
open the server port, the other to falsify the logs.

22:26.030 --> 22:27.940
Lieutenant Grady had a partner.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.820
Had to be someone in-house.

22:29.850 --> 22:32.136
Which rules Renny out... again.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.000
It's a big list.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.360
Our department employs
over 2,000 people.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.030
It is a lot of work, isn't it, Mitch?

22:39.060 --> 22:42.766
I'm gonna need the updated
addresses and contact info. Thanks.

22:42.790 --> 22:46.030
You got it. Tell Ziva I'll poke her.

22:47.020 --> 22:50.230
You know... Facebook.

22:56.370 --> 22:57.470
What are you doing?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.696
I'm waiting for you. You're late.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.970
You got something?

23:01.020 --> 23:02.870
I had something four minutes ago.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.050
Why didn't you call?

23:04.090 --> 23:05.470
Because that's not how it works.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.210
When I find something, Gibbs
immediately walks through the door.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.516
Have you forgotten all of your training?

23:10.540 --> 23:12.660
I remembered your Caf-POW!

23:14.840 --> 23:17.300
Horseshoes and hand grenades, DiNozzo.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.780
Now that that's settled, I lifted our
partial fingerprint from the soap dispenser.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.950
It's still not enough to
get a match from a database,

23:28.980 --> 23:31.776
but it is definitely enough to
incriminate someone if we have a suspect...

23:31.800 --> 23:34.166
suspect, I know. Got a list of 'em.

23:34.190 --> 23:36.350
2,000 of Renny's former coworkers.

23:36.390 --> 23:38.190
Check your inbox.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.300
Got it.

23:45.330 --> 23:48.360
Now, this time, if I find
something, you better already know.

23:50.570 --> 23:51.790
What's this?

23:51.830 --> 23:53.710
For Sister Rosita's ankle.

23:53.740 --> 23:55.440
I stopped by the NCIS gym.

23:55.470 --> 23:58.600
It took me about four minutes.

23:59.910 --> 24:02.240
And you found something.

24:10.830 --> 24:15.120
We've got two embezzlers, and one
of 'em gets trashed, literally.

24:15.670 --> 24:16.650
Why?

24:16.680 --> 24:19.720
Maybe his partner got greedy,
decided he wanted all the money.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.826
But the theft was three years
ago. What took him so long?

24:22.850 --> 24:25.440
Well...

24:26.170 --> 24:28.650
- Maybe...
- He got scared.

24:29.210 --> 24:32.490
He found out his partner was going to
meet with the agent from the original case.

24:32.520 --> 24:37.910
It wasn't DiNozzo, but the killer
didn't know that, so if I'm him,

24:37.950 --> 24:41.336
I'm wondering why my buddy is
meeting with a federal agent.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.740
Hmm, maybe he's going to flip on me.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.460
He can't if he's dead.

24:46.830 --> 24:49.300
There's our motive. We
just need our killer.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.090
May have just found him.

24:52.120 --> 24:57.676
Abby matched a print from Renny's hotel room to one
of his former coworkers, a Commander Carl Davis.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.630
Gear up.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.540
What?

25:03.580 --> 25:06.060
We've just never heard you
say that much at one time.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.510
Or in a week.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.160
Wasn't my job before. Come on.

25:20.140 --> 25:22.946
So, listen, boss, I just wanted to talk
to you about this before we go in.

25:22.970 --> 25:26.910
Um, I was just thinking, 'cause
I'm the boss on this case,

25:26.950 --> 25:30.046
I thought maybe I should drive on the way
back, you know, just for appearances' sake.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.490
It's not that important,
but... neverind.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.560
Here we go.

25:39.660 --> 25:42.660
I'm the boss. Right. Federal agents.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.570
- Yes?
- NCIS. Is Commander Davis here?

25:49.430 --> 25:53.500
Well, he is gone for the week. I'm sorry.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.150
Look, I said he's not here.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.786
- We have a warrant.
- Wait a minute, what are you doing?

25:59.810 --> 26:00.816
- McGee, around back.
- You can't just go in there.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.806
I said he's not here!

26:01.830 --> 26:03.456
- Then we will not have a problem, will we?
- Wait!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.806
- Just calm down. Stay calm, ma'am.
- What do you think... You have no right!

26:05.830 --> 26:08.120
He's not here!

26:11.630 --> 26:13.410
Wait!

26:29.450 --> 26:32.966
Look, you guys have got this all
wrong. H-He likes to be handcuffed.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.930
And the broken nose?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.066
He slipped.

26:36.090 --> 26:37.930
And the lighter fluid?

26:38.370 --> 26:41.590
Look, after what he did, it was
either that or my garden shears.

26:41.630 --> 26:45.510
Guess it was his lucky
day then. Not yours.

26:46.230 --> 26:50.156
The Burning Bed, 1984, Farrah Fawcett.

26:50.180 --> 26:53.140
Torched her husband
while he was sleeping.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.286
Second wife's favoriteovie.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.840
Maybe Commander Davis'
wife is going for a sequel.

26:58.870 --> 27:00.846
Hell hath no fury.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.460
Like a woman scorned.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.816
- Third wife's favorite quote.
- Here, McGee.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.440
Commander Davis' wife received
this in the mail yesterday.

27:11.770 --> 27:13.586
Postmarked from Hawaii.

27:13.610 --> 27:15.860
Over here.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.766
Photos of her husband on a
beach, and he is not alone.

27:22.790 --> 27:25.126
Obviously not the missus.

27:25.150 --> 27:27.146
Who sent it?

27:27.170 --> 27:31.606
"Paid a private investigator to follow my wife.
Just thought you should know what he found."

27:31.630 --> 27:33.690
The other husband...
How kind of him.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.080
What do they say?

27:35.110 --> 27:37.280
"Misery loves company."

27:37.650 --> 27:40.310
Where'd you get that...
Your fourth wife?

27:41.830 --> 27:44.890
- Hold this against your jaw.
- Give us a second.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.360
I thought waking up to
General Quarters was tough.

27:52.110 --> 27:53.696
Thank God you came when you did.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.580
Yeah, would have been a bummer
to find my prime suspect dead.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.040
- Prime...
- Suspect.

28:00.150 --> 28:03.126
For what, cheating on my wife?

28:03.150 --> 28:05.380
Embezzling from the Navy.

28:07.130 --> 28:08.696
You don't play much poker, do you?

28:08.720 --> 28:11.390
Murder of Lieutenant Justin Grady.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.896
Jay's dead? When? How?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.280
There you go.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.226
Now he's got his game face on.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.686
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:20.710 --> 28:21.906
Really?

28:21.930 --> 28:24.960
You left your fingerprint at
the crime scene last night.

28:24.990 --> 28:27.190
The lieutenant was in Hawaii?

28:27.220 --> 28:30.550
Because I was, all last week.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.860
And my wife has the
pictures to prove it.

28:37.290 --> 28:41.626
Okay, I take full responsibility for making
you think that Commander Davis was the killer.

28:41.650 --> 28:43.850
That being said...

28:44.390 --> 28:45.530
it's not my fault.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.650
Apology accepted. I think.

28:47.950 --> 28:54.346
Okay, exhibit A, from the murder scene,
where I found Commander Davis' fingerprint.

28:54.370 --> 28:57.020
Except that Commander Davis was
5,000 miles away at the time.

28:57.050 --> 29:00.726
So how did his fingerprint
get in Renny's hotel room?

29:00.750 --> 29:03.400
I ran every test that
I could on the dispenser

29:03.430 --> 29:06.350
and I found an interesting
chemical compound on the exterior.

29:06.390 --> 29:10.030
Ammonia, arsenic, and hydrogen cyanide.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.830
Broken thumb.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.206
C-Cigar?

29:19.230 --> 29:22.590
- Cigar-ette... smoke.
- Ding!

29:24.110 --> 29:27.490
Except it was a non-smoking room and
the smoke detector never went off.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.886
Where did the smoke come from?

29:29.910 --> 29:33.166
I called the hotel to get
another dispenser for comparison.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.696
Turns out this...

29:34.720 --> 29:37.440
is the model they use in their hotel.

29:38.280 --> 29:41.626
No one's ever seen... this before.

29:41.650 --> 29:43.186
Where'd it come from?

29:43.210 --> 29:46.070
Gibbs could have done that with
just a look. You're such a pushover.

29:46.590 --> 29:49.520
It came from here.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.246
Commander Davis' bathroom.

29:52.270 --> 29:54.830
Part... of a matching set.

29:56.240 --> 30:01.100
Someone stole it from Davis' house
and planted it at the murder scene.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.800
Commander Davis was set up.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.500
The soap dispenser was
planted at the crime scene.

30:06.530 --> 30:08.756
There was a third embezzler.

30:08.780 --> 30:10.360
Looks that way, my friend.

30:10.390 --> 30:12.250
No, Tony, therewas a third embezzler.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.530
I'm looking at Commander
Davis' computer logs.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.400
He transferred the missing money to
an internal account that he created.

30:17.430 --> 30:20.300
Then a third user moved
it to an external one.

30:20.750 --> 30:21.576
Can we trace it?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.736
I'm working on it, but I doubt it.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.110
Okay, pretend I'm Gibbs
and try answering again.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.666
I am working on it, but I doubt it, boss.

30:30.690 --> 30:32.520
That's all I'm gonna get out of you, huh?

30:32.560 --> 30:36.086
W... I traced the account to the Caymans,
but that's as far as I could get. I'm sorry.

30:36.110 --> 30:39.120
Okay, well, give me
something to hold. I don't...

30:40.200 --> 30:40.820
Thank you.

30:40.850 --> 30:43.126
Whoever that third user is, he
covered his tracks pretty well.

30:43.150 --> 30:45.030
Any chance it could
be my doppel-friend?

30:45.060 --> 30:48.836
Renny? No, that much I'm sure
of, but given his research,

30:48.860 --> 30:50.906
you know, he may be able to
provide a little insight.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.486
- We can find our own insight.
- Yeah, but...

30:52.510 --> 30:56.170
Trust me, McGee, if we ask for a
life vest, he's throwing an anchor.

30:58.050 --> 30:59.590
Any luck with Commander Davis?

30:59.620 --> 31:02.936
Gibbs and Ziva have been interrogating
him for over an hour and he's not talking.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.226
So, if they can't get him to talk...

31:05.250 --> 31:06.690
Interrogation's that way.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.480
I know!

31:21.100 --> 31:23.006
You're late, Palmer.

31:23.030 --> 31:27.150
Sorry. Had to wait for Dr. Mallard
to leave for his Pilates class.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.306
Jamaican mocha.

31:29.330 --> 31:31.686
I heard you were boss
again; I stocked up.

31:31.710 --> 31:33.680
- Thanks.
- Just in case.

31:34.930 --> 31:37.950
All right, talk to me.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.686
I got three guys who embezzled
a cool mil from a Navy base.

31:41.710 --> 31:44.340
And Renny Grant was their fall guy.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.910
I did my homework.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.706
First embezzler was found dead,
second was framed for his murder.

31:52.730 --> 31:54.376
So you think the third guy did it?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.570
What do you need me for?

31:57.150 --> 31:59.396
Can't find him.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.396
Did you follow the money?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.980
Can't find that either.

32:03.010 --> 32:07.206
Not surprised. It's common for embezzlers
to sit on the money for a year or two,

32:07.230 --> 32:09.370
at least until the heat wears off.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.286
Killer might finally be
ready for a withdrawal.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.680
And doesn't want to share.

32:15.910 --> 32:18.016
- What'd Renny say?
- About?

32:18.040 --> 32:20.116
The third embezzler.

32:20.140 --> 32:23.130
Renny knows his case
better than anybody.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.680
You haven't talked to him.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.826
Trust me, if I ask for a life
vest, he's throwing me an...

32:29.850 --> 32:33.010
An anchor. Yeah.

32:33.560 --> 32:37.546
Yeah... I guess if I put
an innocent man in prison,

32:37.570 --> 32:41.530
the last thing that I would want
to do is go ask him for help.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.520
But I'd do it, anyway.

32:46.740 --> 32:49.100
Thanks, Palmer. Again.

32:52.830 --> 32:56.150
That's "Agent" Palmer.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.660
Renny!

33:27.060 --> 33:29.060
Renny!

33:36.580 --> 33:38.840
Renny!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.460
Is there anybody here?

33:52.430 --> 33:54.920
Renny!

34:06.410 --> 34:08.255
Pot roast looks a little well done.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.790
Prime rib. Madeira.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.835
Fire department says it's
been cooking for hours.

34:13.860 --> 34:16.850
I guess we know Renny
wasn't expecting company.

34:17.909 --> 34:20.126
Well, he got it anyway.

34:20.150 --> 34:22.076
Point of entry was from here.

34:22.100 --> 34:26.050
There were security bars, but
it appears Renny removed them.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.330
Guess I would, too,
if I had just spent...

34:30.489 --> 34:32.850
Never mind.

34:33.940 --> 34:35.480
Window's been jimmied.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.946
Yes, possibly with this.

34:37.969 --> 34:40.226
I found it behind the bookshelf.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.196
There is blood on it.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.889
Intruder must've dropped
it in the struggle.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.746
Looks like Renny put
up one hell of a fight.

34:51.770 --> 34:54.810
Well, only one thing seems to be missing.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.956
Renny.

34:56.980 --> 34:59.790
Third embezzler knows Renny
might be able to I.D.him.

34:59.830 --> 35:02.440
Yeah, well, he's tying up loose ends.

35:13.110 --> 35:14.270
McGee, BOLO.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.966
- Checked it four minutes ago.
- Check it again.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.080
Ziva, status on the traffic cams.

35:18.110 --> 35:19.476
I will let you know
when I get to my desk.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.936
Gibbs, coordinate with highway patrol.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.310
I want checkpoints at
every on and off ramp.

35:23.630 --> 35:25.226
- Ziva.
- No hits yet.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.206
Widen the search. The whole
county. No, the whole state.

35:28.230 --> 35:29.756
This a waste of resources!

35:29.780 --> 35:31.726
Just do it! Now!

35:31.750 --> 35:34.000
- DiNozzo.
- What?

35:35.030 --> 35:37.010
Campfire.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.496
- Problems?
- No. Everything's peachy.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.850
Nothing I like more than putting
an innocent man in prison.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.830
Except, of course, for
getting him killed.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.690
Renny's dead? I hadn't heard that.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.886
Save the pep talk. We
both know I screwed up.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.100
Yeah. Three years ago.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.220
But now you're making it right.

36:12.860 --> 36:15.340
And me proud.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.650
You've been doing...

36:21.310 --> 36:24.240
a hell of a job, Anthony.

36:25.530 --> 36:28.496
Until about three minutes ago.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.440
Get your head on right.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.886
What would you like me to do?

36:31.910 --> 36:34.450
- Trust your gut.
- Yeah.

36:36.410 --> 36:38.250
I think I'd rather
trust yours right now.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.960
Then give me my damn phone back.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.956
Hope I'm not
interrupting something...

36:46.980 --> 36:49.810
And if I am, I hope somebody's
gonna tell me about it.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.840
What do you got, Abs?

36:56.840 --> 36:59.130
Checking the roadblocks, boss.

36:59.670 --> 37:02.450
So... I was interrupting something.

37:03.050 --> 37:06.180
Abs, what do you got?

37:06.460 --> 37:07.496
The knife from Renny's house.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.150
I identified the blood on it;
The good news is it's not Renny's.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.170
The bad news?

37:11.200 --> 37:13.906
You're such a cynic. There is
no bad news. Only better news.

37:13.930 --> 37:16.080
The blood belongs to...

37:16.110 --> 37:18.746
our murder victim from
the Rosewood Suites.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.060
It's our missing murder weapon.

37:20.090 --> 37:21.240
Our messy murder weapon.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.066
Which is weird, 'cause most killers,
they would rinse before they repeat.

37:24.090 --> 37:26.560
- Why didn't ours?
- Why don't you ask him.

37:29.550 --> 37:32.100
He left his DNA on the handle.

37:43.070 --> 37:45.630
NCIS handling parking tickets now?

37:45.660 --> 37:47.836
- Where's Renny?
- How should I know?

37:47.860 --> 37:49.950
You abducted him.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.640
Why would I do that?

37:53.680 --> 37:56.330
You could almost hear the
band playing in Tony's head.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.626
He really does love this part.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.256
Ah, he's earned it.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.556
Larry, Moe and Curly.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.996
The Three Stooges.

38:05.020 --> 38:08.010
Figured out how to embezzle
a cool mil from the U.S.Navy.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.886
But they needed a fall guy, didn't they?

38:10.910 --> 38:12.160
And that was Renny.

38:12.190 --> 38:16.110
Hey, I'm the one who told you
I thought Renny was framed.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.510
Yeah, it was a neat trick.

38:17.540 --> 38:22.550
I'm going to have to rember that one for the next
time I want someone to think I'm a complete moron.

38:26.980 --> 38:29.156
Betcha five bucks Tony does
the chair-toss technique.

38:29.180 --> 38:31.620
Mm, ten he switches to strong and silent.

38:31.650 --> 38:34.750
Nah, 20 bucks he's gonna
do the picture tear.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.710
You thought suitcase stuffed
Curly was going to flip.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.516
So you killed him.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.766
I'm not sure what you've
been smoking but, uh...

38:43.790 --> 38:47.430
And then our friend Moe
got framed for the murder.

38:48.580 --> 38:53.160
And then you went after Renny, because you figured
he was the only one who could still implicate you.

38:53.210 --> 38:57.370
And with him dead, you
guys were home free.

39:00.290 --> 39:02.596
Recognize this?

39:02.620 --> 39:04.260
We got your DNA.

39:04.300 --> 39:08.450
You should've stuck with embezzling,
because you're going to get life for murder.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.840
Okay, look...

39:12.870 --> 39:15.550
I did follow Lieutenant
Grady to the Rosewood.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.726
But it was just to talk
him out of meeting with you.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.680
And the part where you killed him?

39:19.720 --> 39:22.216
He attacked me.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.520
It was self-defense.

39:27.510 --> 39:29.856
Self-defense.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.396
- Where's Renny?
- I don't know!

39:32.420 --> 39:33.886
I don't even know where he lives!

39:33.910 --> 39:36.846
You left the murder weapon at his house.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.870
No, I left it at the Rosewood.

39:39.900 --> 39:43.020
I don't know who took it to Renny's,
but it sure as hell wasn't me.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.820
I can prove it, too.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.490
I was in court yesterday, all day.

39:50.830 --> 39:53.680
- Court?
- Court.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.160
Court?

39:57.350 --> 39:59.660
Metro busted Wilkins a week
ago for drug possession.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.096
Arraignment was
yesterday. Which means...

40:01.120 --> 40:02.480
He didn't grab Renny.

40:02.510 --> 40:05.086
Wilkins isn't the only
one with legal problems.

40:05.110 --> 40:08.616
Lieutenant Grady's sealed
file just got unsealed.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.686
If he wasn't lying in our morgue, he'd
be under indictment for mail fraud.

40:12.710 --> 40:16.780
Grady was put under investigation three
weeks ago after the Navy received...

40:16.810 --> 40:18.356
An anonymous tip.

40:18.380 --> 40:19.750
Yeah, how did you know?

40:19.780 --> 40:23.170
Metro said Wilkins was busted
after an anonymous tip, too.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.100
It gets better.

40:24.130 --> 40:29.070
Abby says the postmark on the envelope
sent to Commander Davis' wife was fake.

40:29.320 --> 40:32.870
- Photos weren't sent from Hawaii.
- No. It was hand-delivered.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.896
It was all Renny. He
knew who framed him.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.960
Yeah, getting his payback.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.816
If Renny knew who set him
up, why not turn 'em in?

40:40.840 --> 40:42.806
He was buying time.

40:42.830 --> 40:44.990
For what?

41:01.230 --> 41:02.800
Remember me?

41:09.810 --> 41:11.480
Found Sergeant Wilkins' knife?

41:11.510 --> 41:15.950
Oh, yeah. Right where you left it.
He's in custody. Looking at life.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.586
Wasn't part of the
plan, but I'll take it.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.800
They got what they
deserved, no thanks to you.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.136
What do you think you deserve?

41:24.160 --> 41:28.220
Three years of my life back,
but that's not gonna happen.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.866
Thought I told you to stay in town, Ren.

41:30.890 --> 41:33.476
Those tampering charges
are still pending.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.310
That why you're here?

41:37.850 --> 41:39.386
I think you know why I'm here.

41:39.410 --> 41:40.910
You still haven't found the money?

41:40.940 --> 41:45.110
I figured, you know, with all that research
that you did, you might know where they hid it.

41:45.750 --> 41:49.550
- It'd be a hell of a consolation prize.
- Yeah.

41:57.670 --> 42:01.530
Sorry. Wish I could help.

42:07.190 --> 42:10.030
- Heading south?
- I don't know.

42:10.610 --> 42:12.450
Am I?

42:19.290 --> 42:21.520
How'd it go?

42:22.090 --> 42:24.110
I guess I missed him.

42:24.530 --> 42:28.280
Yeah. Well, I figured.

42:30.020 --> 42:33.540
Boat. Bourbon. Basement.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.090
I get it.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.860
There you go, boss.
