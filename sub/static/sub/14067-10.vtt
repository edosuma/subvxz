00:02.250 --> 00:03.850
–Who is this guy?
–Melvin Palmer.

00:03.890 --> 00:05.670
State of Utah vs Denny Crane.

00:05.710 --> 00:07.650
I'll represent the hoot brothers.

00:07.689 --> 00:10.890
For once in your life,
let me do the talking.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.370
Denny!

00:12.390 --> 00:15.070
We were just—
–Do you love him?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.740
I think I do.

00:16.770 --> 00:20.670
This man makes partner, or I walk and
take my name off the door with me.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.200
–Edwin Poole.
–Denny Crane.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.730
–Name on the door.
–Mine, too.

00:23.770 --> 00:25.580
–Crane…
–Poole and…

00:25.590 --> 00:27.470
Schmidt.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.590
Drop the bag, and I'll let you live!

00:50.630 --> 00:53.570
Do it, bitch. Don't make me cap you.

00:53.580 --> 00:57.350
Son, of all the places you could stick
me —you may have already stuck me—

00:57.390 --> 00:58.830
I'd probably be the last to know.

00:58.870 --> 01:00.650
–Drop the bag.
–Turnip!

01:00.660 --> 01:03.070
For God's sake,
what the hell are you…

01:03.110 --> 01:04.810
–Shirley?
–Edwin?

01:04.819 --> 01:06.340
Put that down.
What is wrong with you?

01:06.380 --> 01:07.630
I am so sorry, Shirley.

01:07.670 --> 01:10.280
Of all the people to
mug… I'll deal with him.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.412
This woman is a dear friend of
mine, not to mention a partner.

01:14.470 --> 01:17.420
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:18.150 --> 01:21.530
Edwin, who is this… adorable child?

01:21.540 --> 01:24.430
He's my foster—give me
that! He's my foster son.

01:24.470 --> 01:26.940
I am so sorry, Shirley.
God, what is wrong with you?

01:26.980 --> 01:28.080
You adopted a son?

01:28.120 --> 01:30.120
Yeah, it was either that
or take up fly-fishing.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.580
Shame, Turnip. Shame.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.540
Look how full your cart is.

01:34.550 --> 01:36.490
No wonder your bottom is so—
–Turnip.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.350
–Full and plump.
–He gets cuter by the second.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.810
Isn't it the truth? Well, that's enough
now. Turnip Graves, Shirley Schmidt.

01:42.850 --> 01:44.570
Very nice to meet you, ma'am.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.200
A true pleasure, sir.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.620
Well, it's—it's nice
to see you again.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.240
You look great, and, uh, I'll
deal with him. Come here, you.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.760
Why would you do that and
embarrass me like that?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.930
How was I supposed to
know you'd know the lady?

01:54.970 --> 01:56.850
I know you're not supposed
to walk around parking lots

01:56.890 --> 01:59.860
sticking people in the
buttocks with a knife.

Legal Season 05 Episode 10
“Thanksgiving”

02:28.950 --> 02:30.440
What do you mean,
you've got plans?

02:30.480 --> 02:31.650
You said you were going out of town.

02:31.690 --> 02:34.440
–I said I might go out of town, but—
–Didn't invite me, did you?

02:34.480 --> 02:38.040
Because I never made o-official plans.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.210
Who are you spending
Thanksgiving with?

02:41.250 --> 02:43.480
A friend. Uh, you wouldn't like him.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.470
Who?

02:45.670 --> 02:46.710
–It's personal.
–Personal?

02:46.750 --> 02:49.430
Well, you could come to. I'll ask him.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.090
Who?

02:53.400 --> 02:57.040
Technically, it would be…

02:57.340 --> 03:00.210
Melvin Palmer.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.260
–You must be joking.
–He's a good guy.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.330
You're spending Thanksgiving
with Melvin Palmer?

03:05.370 --> 03:06.330
He's a hoot.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.780
No, y-you're putting me on.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.650
Well, I had no place else
to go, and he called and—

03:10.690 --> 03:12.980
When did you become
friends with that bobo-head?

03:13.020 --> 03:14.420
When he saved our asses.

03:14.460 --> 03:18.470
–He did not save our asses.
–He saved our asses in Utah.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.120
Are you being serious?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.160
He's a decent guy.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.420
No, he is not.
He's nothing of the sort.

03:27.460 --> 03:30.496
–Look—
–And you're not having dinner with him.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.420
We'll find somewhere else to go.

03:32.460 --> 03:36.700
But you will not —will not— be
spending Thanksgiving with that vile—

03:36.740 --> 03:38.100
–I like him.
–I don't care.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.020
No, forget it. No.

03:42.090 --> 03:45.880
No. Nope.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.060
Mugged?

03:52.070 --> 03:54.070
You should've seen
the size of the knife.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.770
–Are you okay?
–No, I'm fine.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.740
I-I just can't believe it happened.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.010
Shirley, you have to tell the police.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.080
No, I don't want to do that.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.990
Shirley, it was an
attempted armed robbery.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.680
Well, he's 9 years old, Carl.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.920
Oh, my God. Now the
homecoming is complete.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.540
Carl Sack, how are you,
my friend?

04:08.580 --> 04:10.540
Never liked you, but what
the hey? I can be courteous.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.250
Shirl, hi, doll. Sorry I'm late.

04:12.290 --> 04:15.788
I hit some traffic, not to
mention a few pedestrians.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.410
Just mowed?'em right—
I can see I've lost you.

04:18.450 --> 04:22.420
Shirley, I don't know what to
say other than I'm so sorry.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.990
Edwin, how long
have you had that boy?

04:25.010 --> 04:27.290
Six months. I've enrolled him in
finishing school, not to worry.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.430
What the hell is this?

04:29.450 --> 04:31.920
You've sued me already?

04:31.930 --> 04:33.010
–Did you read it?
–Why would I?

04:33.050 --> 04:35.480
It's marked “privileged
and confidential.”

04:35.520 --> 04:39.810
Edwin, it was hand-delivered to you
because you were meant to read it.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.460
Ah, well, that's different.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.400
What does it say?

04:45.420 --> 04:47.340
It says the firm is going broke.

04:47.380 --> 04:52.200
Funny. Love her. She's just—
The firm is going broke?

04:52.210 --> 04:54.380
But that was two days ago.
Things have changed.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.780
How?

04:55.790 --> 04:58.380
We are broke.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.790
When you
say broke—

04:59.830 --> 05:03.430
Crane, Poole & Schmidt is bankrupt.
We have no money. Nada. Zilch.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.070
We're busted.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.260
I'll call Congress. They'll bail
us out. After all, we're rich.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.790
I know Hank Paulson. Nutty guy.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.910
–Hey, that's mine.
–It's over, Edwin.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.350
We're done.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.760
I don't know what else to
tell you, Edwin, other than—

05:33.800 --> 05:35.540
You can tell me how it happened.

05:35.580 --> 05:39.550
We had investments in the market, we had
massive receivables from banking industries,

05:39.590 --> 05:41.750
we had to take write-offs.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.550
You just beat the tobacco
companies for millions of dollars.

05:45.590 --> 05:48.130
You think we'll ever
see a penny from that?

05:48.170 --> 05:52.460
After all the appeals, that
victory's going to end up costing us.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.760
Edwin…

05:55.800 --> 05:59.480
we may have to shut our doors.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.820
Do people know?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.680
Only a certain few at this point.

06:07.690 --> 06:10.080
So we're really done, then?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.190
Canceled?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.570
Carl may have overstated that.

06:14.580 --> 06:19.730
There are some possibilities.
I still have hope.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.790
I really thought I'd make it back.

06:26.990 --> 06:29.440
I was getting better and, uh…

06:37.450 --> 06:39.180
Listen, I bought a turkey.

06:39.200 --> 06:43.010
I'd love to have you over for thanksgiving on
Thursday, maybe talk about old times and, uh—

06:43.050 --> 06:46.070
Edwin, thank you. Um, I have plans.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.650
I'm hosting a little thing at my house.

06:50.090 --> 06:53.420
So I'll come to your house, then?

06:58.030 --> 06:59.040
Edwin Poole?

06:59.050 --> 07:01.380
Well, he kind of
invited himself. I—

07:01.420 --> 07:03.070
We were supposed to have a quiet dinner.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.140
I know. I'm
sorry. But—

07:04.180 --> 07:05.670
And his little felon?

07:05.680 --> 07:06.910
Well, he could be joining.

07:06.950 --> 07:07.690
Oh, Shirley.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.710
I know. I wanted a quiet
evening, too. But somehow—

07:10.750 --> 07:13.140
he had no place to go.
Wh-what was I going to say?

07:13.180 --> 07:15.340
Uh, “no” comes to mind. How about “no”?

07:15.380 --> 07:16.110
Carl.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.820
A nice quiet Thanksgiving
dinner, just the two of us—

07:18.860 --> 07:19.790
that's how you billed it.

07:19.830 --> 07:20.860
And how I wanted it—

07:20.900 --> 07:23.590
Shirley, I've got the
research on the McClean—

07:23.630 --> 07:24.830
I thought you'd gone to London.

07:24.870 --> 07:29.640
Oh, yes, I was planning to, but the airline
screwed up with the tickets. It's a long story.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.530
So suffice to say, I'll be staying put.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.410
Oh, well, that's too bad.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.080
I'm having a few people over.
Why don't you come to my house?

07:39.120 --> 07:40.820
Oh, I wouldn't want to put you out.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.680
It wouldn't be any trouble.

07:42.710 --> 07:44.470
Oh, well, sure. I'd quite love that.

07:44.510 --> 07:46.380
–Great. 1:00, then.
–Splendid.

07:46.420 --> 07:49.360
Oh, w-would it be possible
for me to bring Jerry?

07:49.400 --> 07:52.200
I sort of —when I thought
that I didn't have plans—

07:52.240 --> 07:54.160
Jerry would be more than welcome.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.390
Thank you. I'll go tell him.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.040
Sorry.

07:59.050 --> 08:01.020
The idea of spending
a day alone with me—

08:01.060 --> 08:02.210
you just can't bear it, can you?

08:02.250 --> 08:04.400
Oh, you know that's not true.

08:04.420 --> 08:08.670
Can't we just look at this as a
gathering of a big, dysfunctional family?

08:08.710 --> 08:11.260
Can we do that?

08:11.520 --> 08:15.000
–What about us?
–We can be dysfunctional.

08:28.470 --> 08:31.520
–There.
–Thank you.

08:31.530 --> 08:34.350
–Are you okay?
–Yeah, I'm—I'm fine. I…

08:34.360 --> 08:37.010
just tend to get a little
stressed when I host parties.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.260
Do you not remember?

08:38.299 --> 08:39.830
But this is just a dinner.

08:39.870 --> 08:43.350
It is a Thanksgiving dinner, and let's
face it, with this particular group,

08:43.390 --> 08:47.620
the possibilities for catastrophe—
–What?

08:47.630 --> 08:51.970
Oh, hey, what… We're off
to a good start. Come on.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.930
Surprise.

08:56.940 --> 08:57.890
Hey, Turnip beat you to it.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.750
What were you doing,
staring in my window?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.320
Is this how it's gonna be,
dump-on-Turnip day?

09:02.360 --> 09:05.230
Ah, Turnip, hi. I'm Mr Sack.
I've heard a lot about you.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.000
Hands on the wall.
–Oh, come on.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.060
Now, now, don't worry.
I do this to everybody.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.920
Yeah, try not to enjoy yourself, pops.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.570
–Oh, come on.
–Hello. Welcome. Hello.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.960
Mr Poole.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.060
Thank you, Carl.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.630
–Oh, what a beautiful home.
–Oh, thank you very much.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.330
–Is it all paid for?
–Turnip.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.120
–Not a bad question, actually, considering—
–Edwin.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.290
Here, give me your coats.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.020
Here. Let me take those.

09:29.030 --> 09:30.010
Hey, are we late?

09:30.050 --> 09:32.220
–No, you're just perfectly on time.
–Happy Thanksgiving.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.770
Thank you so much, Alan.

09:33.810 --> 09:35.920
Oh, Edwin.
When did they let you out?

09:35.960 --> 09:38.770
They didn't.

09:39.230 --> 09:42.310
–Uh, well, shall we, um, go to the table?
–Already?

09:42.350 --> 09:43.410
What happened—
–We just got here.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.050
To small talk and mingling and picking
at the turkey when nobody's looking?

09:46.090 --> 09:47.100
Just be quiet, Turnip.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.590
I don't think I can get through this.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.260
You will get through this.

09:53.430 --> 09:55.760
Time-out.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.120
The—the food is hot, and,
um, the table is set, so—

10:00.160 --> 10:02.480
Thank God for GPS.

10:02.490 --> 10:04.550
That's the first thing
I'm gonna be thankful for.

10:04.590 --> 10:06.440
–Hey, how you doing, Jerry?
–You invited him?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.592
Looks like you've eaten already.

10:08.930 --> 10:12.420
You must be Shirley Schmidt. I
googled you, good, that's what I did.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.590
You need to update your headshot.

10:14.630 --> 10:16.130
Who's the little guy?
–Edwin Poole.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.990
Melvin Palmer. How
are we doing, sport?

10:18.030 --> 10:19.890
Don't touch me.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.180
Hey, I didn't get my hug
yet, that's what I didn't get.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.510
I'll start with you, Al, you
big hoot. Come here! Oh, man!

10:25.550 --> 10:27.870
This is like old home week,
that's what this is like.

10:27.910 --> 10:30.020
Get in here, Denny.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.610
Thanks, Denny.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.140
All right, now look, it's probably
a good thing, whoever that person is.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.250
Why is it a good thing?

10:54.290 --> 10:56.460
He seems like a bit of an ice breaker.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.020
Ice breaker? The man
could've saved the “Titanic.”

10:59.060 --> 11:00.710
Who the hell is that guy?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.560
Listen, you said you like
a little noise and chaos.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.020
Seems he'll be able
to contribute to that.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.410
Oh, this is gonna be such a disaster.

11:06.450 --> 11:08.740
It's not going to be a disaster.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.560
All right, look, I'm gonna go
out there, I'll get everybody,

11:10.600 --> 11:13.530
I'll get them to the table you
take a second to collect yourself,

11:13.570 --> 11:16.280
then come in, all right?

11:16.290 --> 11:19.720
It's gonna be great. It's
gonna be a splendid day.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.540
–Okay.
–Good idea. Let's drink.

11:39.580 --> 11:44.430
Uh, D-Denny, I just wanted to say
how nice it is to have all of you here.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.110
The food looks positively delicious.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.400
I don't know where to start.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.870
Well, you can start with a moment
of silence, Melvin, or maybe an hour.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.540
Double hoot, that's what you are.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.930
–I'm a double hoot now.
–Perhaps we should pray.

11:53.970 --> 11:56.450
–Yeah, maybe for peace.
–Or start with grace.

11:56.490 --> 11:59.460
–Any volunteers, or shall I—
–I'll say grace.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.530
Okay.

12:05.990 --> 12:06.610
Dear God—

12:06.620 --> 12:09.040
–No, no, no,
–Oh, I think grace was a bad idea.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.480
–Maybe we should skip grace.
–You don't even believe in God. How can you a—

12:11.520 --> 12:13.050
–I do, too.
–A Christian God?

12:13.090 --> 12:14.540
–Does it matter?
–Well, it does to me.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.540
I'm not gonna let you pray
to a Muslim God, not while I—

12:16.580 --> 12:18.180
Why does he have to be
either Christian or Muslim?

12:18.220 --> 12:19.800
He could be Texan,
that's what he could be.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.470
Well, I-I-if he chooses good
over evil, he's Christian.

12:22.510 --> 12:23.740
Why couldn't he be Jewish?

12:23.780 --> 12:26.110
Are you nuts?

12:27.720 --> 12:30.290
I am not giving thanks to
a Jewish God, a Muslim God.

12:30.330 --> 12:31.880
Hindu maybe, 'cause
they love sheep.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.860
–Jew hater.
–What?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.030
–Edwin, Edwin—
–Jew hater.

12:34.070 --> 12:37.970
Enough, enough. Let's
skip grace and let's eat.

12:37.980 --> 12:42.310
And if it's not too much trouble, I'd like to
have a nice Thanksgiving dinner with no fights.

12:42.350 --> 12:44.610
Can we do that, please?

12:44.620 --> 12:47.430
I'm positively famished.

12:50.450 --> 12:52.500
Thank you.

12:53.590 --> 12:56.580
So, Turnip, tell me, what do
little black kids like to eat?

12:56.620 --> 13:00.070
–Oh, for God's sake, Denny.
–What do black kids like to eat?

13:00.110 --> 13:01.050
Well, I want to know.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.820
–Well, how about, “hey, Turnip,
what sort of food do you like?”
–Koreans like korean food. Greeks like greek food.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.830
Feisty bunch.

13:05.970 --> 13:08.050
–Racist?
–Yes, racist. This is a holiday.

13:08.090 --> 13:13.590
Please, let's not extend the systemic
racism of the firm to the dining room table.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.800
What systemic racism of the firm?

13:18.830 --> 13:19.950
Oh, come on, Shirley.

13:19.990 --> 13:22.200
No, I'd like to hear this.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.130
Well, look around the
table or the office.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.050
You see any black attorneys?

13:25.090 --> 13:27.880
–It doesn't mean we're racist.
–Right.

13:27.890 --> 13:32.040
Did you ever think for one second that maybe
black attorneys don't want to work with us,

13:32.080 --> 13:33.870
maybe they want to be with their own?

13:33.910 --> 13:35.280
Denny, don't help me, please.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.150
–Could you please pass the—
–No!

13:37.190 --> 13:40.090
We just had a black man elected
president, and you still think—

13:40.130 --> 13:42.390
–Oh, please.
–What, “oh, please”?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.780
–Never mind.
–No, say it.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.250
I-I want to hear this, Alan.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.380
–I-I don't.
–Neither do I.

13:46.420 --> 13:51.180
I do. Say it, Alan. I want
to hear what you have to say.

13:51.190 --> 13:53.410
What, you really think
we've turned the corner?

13:53.450 --> 13:56.710
Of a hundred senators, one is
black, one, and that's Barack Obama.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.600
Come January, there'll be none.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.260
Of 50 governors, 2 are black, and
one of those is in New York, uh,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.470
by default because Eliot Spitzer
got caught with his hooker.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.350
This country hardly seems willing to
elect black leaders on a regular basis.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.700
But the people of this firm are.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.510
They voted overwhelmingly for Obama.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.850
How do you know what the hell went on in
the privacy of all those voting booths?

14:14.890 --> 14:16.930
Get out of this house.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.090
I haven't even eaten yet.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.850
I don't care.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.226
–He will not say things like that—
–What did I say?

14:24.650 --> 14:27.910
Maybe since Barack
Obama w-was just elected,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.920
we could celebrate the progress that blacks
have made in this country instead of—

14:29.960 --> 14:31.160
Celebrate?

14:31.170 --> 14:35.550
In America, black people are incarcerated
at almost six times the rate of white people.

14:35.590 --> 14:38.040
Turnip here seems already
to be well on his way—

14:38.080 --> 14:42.490
Blacks have double the unemployment rate
of whites and have for over 40 years.

14:42.530 --> 14:46.030
Whether it's that or the government's
underwhelming response to AIDS

14:46.070 --> 14:50.150
among blacks or racial profiling, the black
community continues to get screwed.

14:50.190 --> 14:54.290
Let's not even discuss, os uh, funding for
public schools in black neighborhoods

14:54.330 --> 14:57.780
or our supreme court eviscerating
Brown vs Board of Education.

14:57.820 --> 15:02.310
We've got that, uh, republican congressman
uh, Lynn Westmoreland from Georgia,

15:02.350 --> 15:06.510
who referred to Obama as “uppity”
—not once, twice— “uppity.”

15:06.520 --> 15:10.280
E-even Obama's own running
mate, during the primary, Biden,

15:10.320 --> 15:13.300
praised Obama as being “clean”
and “articulate.” What was that?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.930
We can give thanks for a
lot of things here today,

15:15.970 --> 15:19.150
but the defeat of racism in
America is not one of them,

15:19.190 --> 15:23.360
especially at liberal, white-collar
law firms like Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.010
Look around the table.

15:29.190 --> 15:33.020
Bet you don't get invited
to a lot of dinner parties.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.780
I just wanted to have a-a
nice Thanksgiving dinner,

15:35.820 --> 15:39.054
but you— you couldn't let
that happen, could you?

15:39.060 --> 15:43.760
You just had to screw it up.
–Wait, wait, wait. Let's—
Come on. Let's change the subject.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.370
Can somebody think of, uh, something
more pleasant to talk about?

15:47.410 --> 15:50.310
I was thinking of taking a dump.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.390
Where's the nearest bathroom?

15:53.420 --> 15:56.210
Through there.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.850
Don't take anything else.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.230
I love the holidays, that's what I love.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.820
You know, if I could just say…

16:33.960 --> 16:36.010
that I'm sorry.

16:36.030 --> 16:39.340
I realize I get worked
up, and I do apologize.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.530
I certainly didn't mean
to ruin anyone's dinner.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.570
You didn't ruin mine, good buddy.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.260
Oh, goody.

16:49.270 --> 16:52.600
Edwin, tell us, what's new with you?

16:53.020 --> 16:55.530
Well, economic armageddon,
for one thing.

16:55.570 --> 16:57.000
–The firm is—
–Edwin…

16:57.010 --> 16:59.400
That—that's our secret.

17:00.260 --> 17:02.920
–What secret?
–Nothing.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.750
Sounds very good.
Did it not sound good?

17:04.790 --> 17:06.520
–Just let it drop, Alan.
–I love secrets.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.270
We used to play this little game— I'll
show you mine, you show me yours—

17:10.310 --> 17:12.470
old and fat people excluded, of course.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.079
Denny, you'd be on the bubble there.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.339
Are you trying to be offensive?

17:16.380 --> 17:18.829
That was aggressive.

17:18.839 --> 17:19.550
What the hell is that?

17:19.589 --> 17:20.760
–Edwin—
–He's a popper.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.869
That's what he is.
Get him to purr, big guy.

17:22.910 --> 17:28.454
Hey, Mel, keep acting like a turkey, you're
gonna get stuffed and carved, hot stuff.

17:33.210 --> 17:36.670
Thank you all… very much.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.090
What'd we do?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.800
Just trying to make conversation.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.120
Oh, by the way, where's the little
black kid? He can't still be crapping.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.500
Excuse me. You're gonna have
to stop that. It's annoying.

17:47.540 --> 17:50.240
–Leave him alone, please.
–Stop it.

17:54.710 --> 17:58.320
One day, we'll look back and laugh.

17:58.330 --> 17:59.740
How about we just try
to make the best of it?

17:59.780 --> 18:01.150
With that group?

18:01.170 --> 18:02.660
I'm so sorry in invited them.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.680
It was such a bad idea.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.910
What was I thinking?

18:04.950 --> 18:06.810
What were you thinking?

18:06.820 --> 18:11.300
I mean, you had to know at some
level this is exactly how it would go.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.290
You just roll with
everything, don't you?

18:13.330 --> 18:18.082
Yeah, I was hoping to roll with you…
until you invited all the children.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.500
–What the hell is this?
–Uh, Denny.

18:25.510 --> 18:26.770
Shirley and Carl are kissing.

18:26.810 --> 18:27.620
Oh, Denny. Cou you give us—

18:27.660 --> 18:29.250
–How could you?
–How could I what?

18:29.290 --> 18:31.510
Kissing him. You're cheating.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.260
–Denny.
–Cheating?

18:32.300 --> 18:33.810
We missed it. Kiss again.

18:33.850 --> 18:34.710
–Oh, get out.
–Damn it.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.490
No, Denny got to see.

18:35.530 --> 18:37.870
–Am I the only who hasn't sucked face with her?
–I haven't.

18:37.910 --> 18:41.804
How about Jerry here? Have you
gotten down with the mascot?

18:42.190 --> 18:44.790
Jerry! Jerry! What is wrong with you?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.650
–Jerry, calm down. Calm down.
–You big freak.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.530
Look, could you—could you
all please just go home?

18:49.570 --> 18:52.500
No, wait. You know what? No, damn it.
This nonsense is gonna stop right now.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.470
Go back to the table. Go ahead. Go.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.380
We're all going back
to the table right now.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.150
Come on, we are gonna sit down…

18:58.190 --> 19:03.550
and we're going to be nice to each
other, and we're going to give thanks.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.690
That was not acceptable at all, Jerry.

19:09.730 --> 19:10.440
Did you hear
what he s—

19:10.480 --> 19:12.510
I heard what he said,
and it was offensive,

19:12.550 --> 19:15.460
but that doesn't mean
you resort to violence.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.520
The incident in the caf? was bad enough.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.730
For God's sake, Jerry, you're
a partner in a law firm.

19:19.770 --> 19:22.410
You're an adult.
–Oh, shut up.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.690
I'm sorry.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.880
What's going on with you?

19:29.890 --> 19:32.560
I just thought…

19:32.580 --> 19:35.160
it would all go away when…

19:35.170 --> 19:36.440
You thought what would go away?

19:36.480 --> 19:37.630
The ridicule.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.280
When I made partner, I thought—
and I thought I would feel…

19:41.320 --> 19:46.060
once I was accepted by others,
the esteem— but it's no better.

19:46.070 --> 19:47.700
I feel no differently about myself.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.690
That word that he used,
what he called me—

19:50.700 --> 19:52.510
–Mascot.
–That's what I am.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.576
That's not true.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.330
Katie treats me like a chia pet.

19:55.370 --> 19:57.230
She all but pats me on the head
and gives me a cookie when I'm g—

19:57.270 --> 20:00.460
How dare you say such a thing.

20:00.470 --> 20:01.930
–Katie, this is a private—
–No, it isn't.

20:01.970 --> 20:04.130
That was an indictment of
me, my friendship with you,

20:04.170 --> 20:07.060
which I assumed to be
extraordinarily meaningful,

20:07.100 --> 20:08.530
and I'm offended by it.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.240
You may seek to
trivialize yourself, Jerry.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.580
I will not allow you to belittle me
and my feelings in the process.

20:13.620 --> 20:18.510
Katie, if I get one more maternal lecture
from you, I am gonna throw up twice—

20:18.550 --> 20:24.430
not once, but twice. It would take two
full heavings to get all the puke out.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.740
You can go to hell, Jerry.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.040
It's one thing to do it,
but to rub my nose in it.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.740
–Denny, we were not rubbing your nose in it.
–Yes, you were.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.260
Was that the big plan?

20:41.270 --> 20:45.300
Get everybody here under the pretext
of my birthday and humiliate me?

20:45.340 --> 20:46.160
'Cause if that was the goal…

20:46.200 --> 20:51.250
Denny, we're here for
Thanksgiving, not your birthday.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.100
Well, you know what I mean.
Gathering people up and—

20:57.140 --> 20:59.580
Pops and the old lady are doing it?

20:59.590 --> 21:02.710
Denny, you and I are not a couple.

21:02.720 --> 21:07.580
We have not been a
couple for over 25 years.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.076
A-and you and Carl are?
Are you back together?

21:15.940 --> 21:18.550
Yes.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.810
Excuse me a second.

21:56.390 --> 21:59.560
Denny, did you really
think it was your birthday?

21:59.600 --> 22:02.910
What difference does…

22:03.460 --> 22:06.760
Denny, look at me.

22:09.090 --> 22:15.650
Did you think we were assembled here to
celebrate your birthday, which is in January?

22:21.720 --> 22:24.880
Oh, my God.

22:25.710 --> 22:29.570
I… I get a little, uh, confused…

22:30.720 --> 22:35.080
w-when I get agitated.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.930
Has this happened often?

23:06.940 --> 23:10.620
No. But it's happened.

23:10.970 --> 23:14.090
And it's usually when you get upset?

23:17.290 --> 23:19.730
Okay. So we go in for
another test, see—

23:19.770 --> 23:22.590
I don't want another test.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.976
There's nothing they can
tell me that I don't know.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.780
There's no cure.

23:29.790 --> 23:32.879
Okay, look, here's what I know—
I've known you six years, and

23:32.919 --> 23:36.750
during that time, there's been
very little progression, if any.

23:36.790 --> 23:41.310
You're 75 now. Like the doctor said, you
probably won't live long enough for the Alz—

23:41.350 --> 23:44.970
mad cow to… get you.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.260
It's already getting me, Alan.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.960
No, it isn't, Denny.

23:47.980 --> 23:51.480
People get confused sometimes.
–I am slipping, Alan.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.970
You know it.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.440
I know it.

24:06.210 --> 24:13.920
? I know you belong to somebody else ?

24:13.930 --> 24:20.320
? but tonight you belong to me ?

24:22.120 --> 24:30.450
? although we're apart
you're part of my heart ?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.550
I'm sorry.

24:45.070 --> 24:48.970
I never meant to trivialize either
our relationship or feelings.

24:49.010 --> 24:50.270
Well, you did just that, didn't you?

24:50.310 --> 24:52.120
Look, toots, how about you
let me finish a sentence?

24:52.160 --> 24:54.940
That too much work for you or…

25:01.730 --> 25:06.230
I really can't be that objective about
either our friendship or your feelings or—

25:06.270 --> 25:06.770
Why?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.340
Because I love ya, all right?
Have I been too subtle?

25:09.380 --> 25:13.934
I gotta rent a billboard? Get a lousy
plane to fly overhead, pulling—

25:26.500 --> 25:28.420
I love you.

25:28.450 --> 25:33.790
I realize that imposes no obligation
on your part to love me back.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.650
And as consolation prizes go…

25:37.670 --> 25:42.620
I can think of nothing more
extraordinary than your friendship.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.980
You need to know…

25:47.000 --> 25:49.990
that you are…

25:50.010 --> 25:53.350
the most incredible…

25:53.370 --> 25:56.640
generous, charitable…

25:56.670 --> 26:00.580
beautiful woman I have ever met.

26:03.050 --> 26:07.420
And I'm in love with you.

26:19.850 --> 26:24.970
? My honey, I know with the dawn ?

26:24.980 --> 26:28.990
? that you will be gone ?

26:29.000 --> 26:34.110
? but tonight you belong to me ?

26:34.120 --> 26:37.300
? just to little old me ?

26:38.070 --> 26:39.540
–Good.
–Say, uh, attention please.

26:39.580 --> 26:43.100
We're gonna make one last
ill-fated attempt at having dinner.

26:43.140 --> 26:46.540
Your presence is requested
in the dining room.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.550
These people like to play with fire.

26:50.590 --> 26:51.450
Tell me about it.

26:51.490 --> 26:53.820
I ain't goin'?back in there.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.950
Smart kid.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.330
I have a question, Edwin.

27:07.340 --> 27:10.320
I can't help but think, uh,
you're a bit of a mental, right?

27:10.360 --> 27:11.740
I am. Carrots, please.

27:11.780 --> 27:16.190
Why would social services ever
put a-a child in your care?

27:16.210 --> 27:18.340
What's wrong with me other
than being mentally unbalanced?

27:18.380 --> 27:21.750
This is a country that regulates
everything except Wall Street and the rich,

27:21.790 --> 27:24.110
who we let run amok,
but everything else…

27:24.150 --> 27:27.140
Parenting— that's the
hardest job anywhere.

27:27.150 --> 27:28.280
What's your point?

27:28.320 --> 27:32.100
How can we pass out children to nut
jobs, especially little black children,

27:32.140 --> 27:35.704
who typically are at risk
and need the best parenting?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.180
What?

27:37.190 --> 27:41.190
Do you know, Denny, that the fastest growing
segment of homeless in this country is children?

27:41.230 --> 27:42.170
What's that got to do with anything?

27:42.210 --> 27:43.850
It's got to do with
these kids need homes.

27:43.890 --> 27:46.510
You know, I'm—I'm not sure
I like where this is heading.

27:46.550 --> 27:48.140
Maybe we could change the subject.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.350
We're all out of subjects.

27:49.390 --> 27:51.350
Well, maybe we could talk about
bankruptcy. That might pick up—

27:51.390 --> 27:51.970
Oh, damn it.

27:52.010 --> 27:55.000
There's nothing wrong with bankruptcy,
Shirley. It's the in thing to be these days…

27:55.040 --> 27:56.950
Oh, good, you're gonna
make fun of poverty now.

27:56.990 --> 27:59.480
Hey, how about all those poor
schmucks losing their homes?

27:59.520 --> 28:01.170
I bet that's fun.
–I'm not making fun of those schmucks.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.520
It's the schmucks in suits
that I'm making fun of.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.170
Do we have to fight?

28:04.180 --> 28:08.190
Can we just eat and make small
talk and pretend we like each other?

28:08.230 --> 28:09.870
Hell, we do like each
other. Why these guys—

28:09.910 --> 28:12.700
Will you shut up?

28:14.160 --> 28:17.070
That was aggressive.

28:18.950 --> 28:22.380
I'm sorry. I just…

28:23.170 --> 28:25.480
It was my fault. I should never…

28:26.260 --> 28:29.240
The truth is, Carl, I…

28:29.900 --> 28:32.320
I'm sorry.

28:32.330 --> 28:38.090
I guess I wanted a big, noisy
dinner because sometimes…

28:38.670 --> 28:43.460
when the din is loud, I can… hear him.

28:45.670 --> 28:48.640
Hear who?

28:52.120 --> 28:55.240
My father.

28:58.020 --> 29:02.840
This is my first Thanksgiving
without him, ever, and…

29:03.240 --> 29:08.340
I apologize, but, uh, it's
hard to face the quiet, and I…

29:08.720 --> 29:12.680
I guess I can find comfort in tumult.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.100
Well, once again,
thank you all very much.

29:22.140 --> 29:23.650
She said she liked the tumult.

29:23.690 --> 29:25.260
And why are you making it all about you?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.380
This was supposed to be a quiet
dinner between Shirley and me.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.380
Well, that certainly would've
been dull. Can you imagine?

29:30.420 --> 29:31.650
I wonder what you
might have talked about.

29:31.690 --> 29:34.690
Probably about how the
firm is going broke.

29:38.350 --> 29:41.400
The firm is going broke?

29:42.290 --> 29:46.740
Did I know this… and forget? Did I?

29:46.750 --> 29:49.710
No, Denny. You didn't know.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.740
Well, what's happened?

29:51.750 --> 29:53.290
There he goes, making
it all about him again.

29:53.330 --> 29:54.530
Oh, will you shut up?

29:54.570 --> 29:57.830
No, Carl. It affects us, too.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.140
What's going on?

30:08.640 --> 30:12.110
The firm is broke.

30:31.970 --> 30:35.820
We're exploring a number of
ways to get an influx of capital.

30:35.860 --> 30:37.530
We believe we can—
–How could this happen?

30:37.570 --> 30:39.100
How? We got hammered, Denny,
just like everybody else.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.790
My name is on the door!

30:40.810 --> 30:42.180
Why wasn't I told, damn it?

30:42.220 --> 30:43.500
They knew you'd be upset.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.560
Next thing, you'd be running around
telling everybody it was your birthday.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.420
Gun!

30:48.430 --> 30:50.770
–I've been hit!
–Denny, for God's sake.

30:50.810 --> 30:55.340
That's all I hear. “Denny, for God's sake.
Denny, for God's sake. Denny, for God's sake!”

30:55.380 --> 30:57.290
Why doesn't anybody tell me the truth?

30:57.330 --> 30:58.450
I am telling you the truth.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.380
The half-truth.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.840
Ah, I'm losing blood.

31:00.870 --> 31:02.440
It was just a paintball, dawg.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.080
–No, I'm telling you exactly—
–What about you and Shirley?

31:05.120 --> 31:05.910
What about it?

31:05.950 --> 31:08.930
How serious are you?
I want to know.

31:09.730 --> 31:12.420
Actually, we sort of all do.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.870
Okay.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.530
Now you know before even Shirley.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.620
My plan, after our intimate
little dinner together, alone,

31:35.660 --> 31:40.910
without any of you, was
to ask her to marry me.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.590
Can you believe it?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.810
As partner, I'm on the
hook for the firm's debts.

32:10.850 --> 32:13.970
I could be losing money.

32:13.980 --> 32:17.520
Jerry, I'm not quite sure how to
respond to your little revelation.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.470
You don't need to. It's
my problem, not yours.

32:19.510 --> 32:21.750
It's my problem if it
affects our friendship.

32:21.790 --> 32:24.450
I remain committed to the
friendship. I won't let this—

32:24.490 --> 32:27.380
Easier said than done.

32:29.190 --> 32:32.850
Perhaps we should seek out
some sort of couples' therapy.

32:32.890 --> 32:34.280
We're not a couple, remember?

32:34.320 --> 32:35.650
Well, yes, we are.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.600
Perhaps not one romantically
linked, but one just the same—

32:39.610 --> 32:44.840
quite an extraordinary couple
with a fairly complicated problem.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.470
I think you should still ask her.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.140
The moment has slightly passed.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.880
No, it hasn't.

33:14.890 --> 33:19.290
If it's meant to be, Carl,
it's the perfect moment.

33:19.730 --> 33:20.850
You obviously love her.

33:20.890 --> 33:24.990
You must feel confident
that Shirley loves you.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.610
Don't let all of us and our…

33:27.640 --> 33:30.170
foolishness get in your way.

33:30.180 --> 33:32.387
Personally, I'm a little
discouraged about what it

33:32.427 --> 33:35.830
means for my own conjugal
prospects with her, but…

33:36.380 --> 33:38.220
clearly she needs cheering up, Carl.

33:38.260 --> 33:41.362
Her father is dead, and
the ice cream's melted.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.460
It was wrong of me to pull
this ring out in front of Denny.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.160
What ring?

33:48.690 --> 33:51.620
Just kidding.

33:51.630 --> 33:55.100
Ask her to marry you, Carl.

33:55.110 --> 33:56.880
I want her to be happy, really.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.370
We all do.

33:58.380 --> 34:00.560
Shirley deserves a good man.
You're a good man, Carl.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.780
I know that even if
I don't much like you.

34:02.820 --> 34:03.870
Why is everybody in here?

34:03.910 --> 34:07.250
Oh, you know what? Could everybody just
clear out? I'd like a little privacy.

34:07.290 --> 34:08.770
What's wrong with having it with us?

34:08.810 --> 34:12.630
What's going on? Why
is everybody in here?

34:18.060 --> 34:20.429
–Carl has news.
–No, he doesn't.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.139
What news?

34:24.040 --> 34:25.810
Oh, this is not how I planned it.

34:25.850 --> 34:30.340
Planned what? Will somebody
tell me what is going on?

34:30.630 --> 34:33.850
Shirley, I…

34:36.360 --> 34:37.679
No, never mind. We'll discuss it later.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.330
No, we won't. We'll
discuss it right now.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.230
Hell, where I come from, we
grab the bull by the horns,

34:41.270 --> 34:44.750
that's what we do.
–No, no, no, no. Here, I'll do it. I'll do it.

34:44.790 --> 34:47.449
Shirley…

34:49.070 --> 34:51.690
will you marry…
–Carl?

34:54.650 --> 34:57.190
He loves you.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.550
He wants to spend the
rest of his life with you.

35:03.670 --> 35:06.530
Carl, i-is this for real?

35:06.540 --> 35:07.780
Uh, except the execution.

35:07.820 --> 35:09.510
I didn't mean for
Denny to do my bidding.

35:09.550 --> 35:12.920
Yeah, I'm Cyrano de Bushwhack.

35:12.930 --> 35:17.090
Shirley, I have never
loved a woman like I…

35:17.480 --> 35:20.880
As of this morning, our
relationship was a secret.

35:20.890 --> 35:23.850
Secret's out, toots. Just…

35:26.360 --> 35:28.690
Denny.

35:31.180 --> 35:34.880
Please, Shirley…

35:34.890 --> 35:38.430
will you marry me?

35:43.490 --> 35:46.360
I'll give you away.

35:47.070 --> 35:48.930
I have had…

35:48.950 --> 35:50.990
six marriage proposals,

35:51.020 --> 35:56.160
but this is by far the most bizarre.

35:56.170 --> 35:58.830
–We're a bizarre group.
–Yeah.

35:58.840 --> 36:04.630
Do me the honor of spending
the rest of your life with me.

36:08.260 --> 36:11.570
I would love to marry you, Carl.

36:15.730 --> 36:18.020
Really?

36:18.030 --> 36:19.990
–May I kiss—
–Denny…

36:20.000 --> 36:23.250
I-I would like to kiss Carl, so…

36:27.890 --> 36:30.680
Um, is the day rescued?

36:30.700 --> 36:34.220
Consider it saved.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.730
All right, contrary to vicious rumors,
the ice cream is not all melted.

36:51.770 --> 36:52.910
Jerry, one scoop or two?

36:52.950 --> 36:54.520
Just one, thank you.

36:54.530 --> 36:56.540
There you are.

36:56.550 --> 36:58.910
Katie, this your slice.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.820
Thank you.

36:59.830 --> 37:02.300
I am a 2-scoop kind of
guy, if you don't mind.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.470
Really? And I've always
thought you were a scoop short.

37:04.510 --> 37:06.830
–Say it for me, Jerry.
–Hoot.

37:08.870 --> 37:10.600
So everybody have a slice now?

37:10.640 --> 37:13.750
–Yes.
–Thank you.

37:14.790 --> 37:17.960
–May I just say—
–No!

37:18.400 --> 37:20.920
Well, I'm gonna say it just the same.

37:20.930 --> 37:25.010
I grew up in a very estranged…

37:25.030 --> 37:28.350
unhappy… house.

37:28.930 --> 37:32.440
Most Thanksgivings, my mother spent
serving dinner at other people's homes,

37:32.480 --> 37:35.460
and my father would spend it…

37:37.440 --> 37:41.020
I spent many a Thanksgiving in my room,

37:41.030 --> 37:44.690
imagining what big family
dinners were like and—

37:44.700 --> 37:47.940
Alan, is this gonna be like a closing?

37:50.060 --> 37:52.760
And as I imagined it…

37:52.780 --> 37:58.030
it was almost exactly like… this.

37:59.540 --> 38:04.170
A whole bunch of people actually talking,
right there in each other's faces,

38:04.210 --> 38:07.900
laughing one second
and angry the next and…

38:07.930 --> 38:09.660
Look what we've
covered toy—

38:09.700 --> 38:12.710
race, politics…

38:12.740 --> 38:18.250
God, marriage, love, death.

38:22.830 --> 38:26.480
What fun.

38:29.370 --> 38:32.250
Thank you for having us, Shirley.

38:32.260 --> 38:36.760
This is… some family.

38:47.180 --> 38:50.430
–Thank God for the pie.
–Thank God for the pie.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.824
Everybody put something in their
mouth so we can't talk anymore.

39:36.370 --> 39:39.868
Denny, are you really okay
with them getting married?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.610
I don't know.

39:44.920 --> 39:48.070
I will be.

39:49.860 --> 39:53.330
I harbored this fantasy that we'd…

39:54.970 --> 39:58.940
Imagine my loss. It could
be the love I never knew.

39:59.290 --> 40:02.200
I'll tell it to you.

40:02.970 --> 40:06.250
Unless I forget.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.850
How often have you been…

40:08.860 --> 40:11.780
getting confused like that?

40:11.790 --> 40:15.470
Well, n-not, uh, not too.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.630
God, if I go the way
Shirley's father did—

40:19.670 --> 40:21.580
You won't.

40:21.590 --> 40:24.320
–How do you know that?
–Because I'll shoot you.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.858
–You wouldn't actually—
–I've already bought the gun.

40:27.970 --> 40:30.720
You promise?

40:35.710 --> 40:40.450
Denny, you have defied
the odds your entire life.

40:40.460 --> 40:43.120
You'll continue to defy the odds.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.508
You're probably gonna out live us all.
We'll all be dead and buried,

40:46.548 --> 40:50.960
and you'll still be out there,
doing Priceline commercials.

40:53.070 --> 40:57.390
All the topics we covered
today, we left out…

40:57.400 --> 41:00.110
the afterlife.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.900
Think there is one?

41:01.910 --> 41:04.920
Oh, I don't…

41:05.890 --> 41:09.540
Think we'll be together
somewhere else, on a—on a—

41:09.570 --> 41:13.620
on a bigger balcony, together again?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.530
I do.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.050
Will we be naked?

41:30.890 --> 41:35.730
I ask because I wonder,
are there clothes in heaven?

41:35.740 --> 41:42.400
And are we as we were when we were
young, or are we as we were when we died?

41:42.410 --> 41:43.610
Is that important?

41:43.630 --> 41:44.340
Well, it is to me.

41:44.380 --> 41:49.000
I don't want to go through the rest
of eternity with the, uh, mad cow.

41:50.470 --> 41:56.650
I think you are in heaven as you were
in the best of times here on earth.

41:57.090 --> 42:01.040
–Like right now?
–Like right now.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.820
Thanks.

42:10.640 --> 42:13.200
Thanks.
