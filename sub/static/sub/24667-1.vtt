01:31.700 --> 01:33.533
So how are you feeling?

01:33.533 --> 01:35.533
Good, just tired.

01:35.533 --> 01:37.100
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.067
Is she all right now?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.400
She's asleep, thank gosh.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.433
Uh-hm.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.500
God, she's been
such a nightmare.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.400
She doesn't want to leave.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.467
I got that!

01:49.467 --> 01:52.500
Jesus, I thought
she was going to stab me!

01:52.500 --> 01:54.833
I've never seen her temper
get that bad before.

01:54.833 --> 01:58.033
I thought it was pretty unusual,
even by her standards.

01:58.033 --> 02:01.133
Well, I'm just glad
she's asleep now.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.400
I couldn't handle her being

02:02.400 --> 02:03.800
any more
of a little bitch.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.000
- Uh, John...
- Well, you know I'm right.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.933
- That's not the point.
- All right. Fine.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.900
Christ!

02:11.900 --> 02:13.567
What the hell
happened to her now?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.033
She can't be awake.

02:15.033 --> 02:16.067
Caroline, come on!

02:16.067 --> 02:16.900
All right, John.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.367
- Hey!
- Okay, darling, wake up.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.033
No, no!

02:21.033 --> 02:23.167
Kate, will you wake up.

03:18.133 --> 03:20.000
I heard shouting.
Is um...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.800
is everything all right?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.767
Yeah. I'm just, um...

03:26.367 --> 03:27.767
Do you want anything?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.033
No.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.733
Do you remember
what it was about?

03:36.967 --> 03:37.833
Not clearly.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.800
Did it have to do
with the house?

03:39.800 --> 03:42.233
Your uncle's house, I mean,
not ours.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.000
Ever since the letter, you know,
you've been agitated.

03:51.667 --> 03:58.533
So, I... um... look,
if you want to go,

03:58.533 --> 04:00.300
I mean, I can come with you.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.167
It might help to
clear things up a bit.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.700
Hey, I'm still really tired.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.000
Can... can we just talk
in a bit?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.300
Sure.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.833
Sorry for waking you.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.067
Hello.

06:21.067 --> 06:22.267
Hello?

06:27.967 --> 06:29.933
Hello.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.800
Hello.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.900
Hu... Hi.

06:36.900 --> 06:40.600
Um, I'm looking for a room.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.400
We don't use this door
for guests.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.100
Sorry, I... I don't have
a reservation.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.600
I just saw the sign
on the main road.

06:50.967 --> 06:53.233
Well, I suppose
I better show you around.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.133
Just through here.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.900
Thank you.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.167
It's not huge,
but it's comfortable.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.100
Well, I'll leave you
to get settled.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.733
I was going to do meat stew
later, if you'd like.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.700
- Thanks.
- Perhaps about 8.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.733
- Okay.
- I'll come and get you.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.900
The bathroom's
just through there.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.833
You may have to leave
the water run a bit.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.000
Not sure when it was
last used, but...

07:42.333 --> 07:45.300
Steven, hi. It's me.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.667
Um, I guess you're out.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.000
Listen.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.500
<i>I'm so sorry
for just leaving</i>

07:53.500 --> 07:56.200
<i>without saying anything.</i>

07:56.200 --> 07:57.933
<i>And just going so abruptly.</i>

07:59.700 --> 08:01.500
<i>You were right though.</i>

08:01.500 --> 08:04.067
<i>That was a good idea.</i>

08:04.067 --> 08:07.567
<i>I needed to get away
from the city and...</i>

08:08.667 --> 08:10.233
<i>from everything.</i>

08:12.300 --> 08:14.800
I'll, um...
I'll be in touch...

08:16.133 --> 08:17.867
<i>in a few days.</i>

08:19.533 --> 08:21.133
<i>I'll speak soon, okay?</i>

08:22.500 --> 08:24.667
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

09:31.900 --> 09:33.267
Hello.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.133
Huh.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.700
Thank you.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.167
Are you saying grace?

10:53.167 --> 10:54.767
Of sorts.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.967
So, my wife tells me
you're from London.

11:13.967 --> 11:17.467
Hmmm. Sorry.

11:17.467 --> 11:18.900
Yes, I am.

11:21.033 --> 11:23.033
And what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

11:23.033 --> 11:27.267
I have some family matters
I need to see to, so...

11:27.267 --> 11:28.500
Uh-huh.

11:33.800 --> 11:38.033
My Uncle Liam, he passed away
not too long ago.

11:38.033 --> 11:42.833
So apparently, some things
have fallen to me.

11:44.567 --> 11:46.233
Your uncle?

11:46.233 --> 11:47.500
Apparently.

11:49.033 --> 11:52.000
My family passed away
when I was younger.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.133
That's unfortunate.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.667
I didn't even know
I had an uncle.

12:06.733 --> 12:09.000
So how do you like it?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.600
The stew?

12:12.533 --> 12:14.633
Is that a local recipe?

12:14.633 --> 12:17.100
It is.
In some form or another.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.367
- Hmmm.
- Will you be staying for long?

12:20.367 --> 12:24.833
Um, I don't know.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.333
Sorry.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.833
I'm going to try and see
the estate person tomorrow.

12:29.733 --> 12:32.067
And, you know,
I should...

12:32.067 --> 12:33.667
I should know after that.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.667
- Is that okay?
- Uh-hm.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.100
It shouldn't be too long.
No more than a few days.

13:48.933 --> 13:50.067
Hello.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.533
Hello.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.900
Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah,
I stopped by yesterday.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.100
Tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.533
Tomorrow is good.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.067
Okay.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.433
All right.
Thank you.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.033
See you then.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.200
Bye.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.167
Miss Reynolds,
we meet at last.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.867
- Well then.
- I'm here to sort out my...

15:08.867 --> 15:11.500
Your uncle's estate.
That's right. Yes.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.167
Now I have that...
oh, here we are.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.567
Uh, were you close?

15:20.567 --> 15:22.733
To be honest until
I got your letters,

15:22.733 --> 15:25.767
I didn't know I had an uncle.

15:25.767 --> 15:28.100
I didn't have much interaction
with the man.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.800
He was very private.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.300
Liked to keep
himself to himself,

15:32.300 --> 15:34.600
if you know what I mean.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.967
Well, it makes sense
at least, hmmm?

15:37.967 --> 15:39.500
What makes sense?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.700
You do know how he died?

15:44.333 --> 15:46.900
Oh, sorry.
I assumed you knew.

15:47.933 --> 15:51.267
I'm afraid he...
he took his own life.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.667
Oh.

15:58.733 --> 15:59.800
Sorry.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.667
Look, are you okay?

16:05.333 --> 16:06.667
Yeah.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.400
Look, we can arrange to
do this another time perhaps.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.800
No.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.867
If it's all the same,
I would like to do it today.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.533
Today?

16:14.533 --> 16:18.667
Yes, okay.
That should be no problem.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.733
Uh, well, I've just got to
check the calendar first.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.833
Things have been hectic
this winter.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.000
Uh...

16:29.300 --> 16:30.800
uh...

16:32.233 --> 16:33.967
do we take my car?

16:37.900 --> 16:40.867
You okay?
You look a little pale.

16:42.733 --> 16:45.167
I just didn't sleep well.

16:59.533 --> 17:02.367
Well, this is it.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.733
Here, let me get that for you.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.433
It doesn't look like much,
but it comes with 13 acres.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.500
Mostly woodland.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.700
And well, shall we go in?

17:23.933 --> 17:25.500
You can see why
your uncle liked the place.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.833
It's uh... it's quaint.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.400
I'll, uh,
I'll open up for you.

17:50.567 --> 17:54.133
Ah, this is it.

17:54.133 --> 17:55.833
I recognize this.

17:55.833 --> 17:56.867
Really?

17:57.833 --> 18:01.100
Well, I'm not an estate agent
obviously,

18:01.100 --> 18:05.100
but the house
seems to be in good nick.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.833
And I don't have
the details to hand,

18:07.833 --> 18:11.733
but by all accounts,
there's a kitchen in there,

18:11.733 --> 18:13.233
a bedroom down there,

18:13.233 --> 18:16.333
and a fine big adjoining space
down the back there

18:16.333 --> 18:18.033
that was used for storage.

18:22.767 --> 18:26.267
Look, uh, would you like
if I, uh, left you alone

18:26.267 --> 18:28.033
and you could look at the house
in your leisure?

18:28.033 --> 18:30.033
Yeah, thank you.
That would be nice.

18:30.033 --> 18:32.467
So, look, I'll leave
the keys here.

18:32.467 --> 18:35.967
And sure, we can go over
the paperwork tomorrow.

18:35.967 --> 18:36.800
Ah, Tom!

18:36.800 --> 18:38.233
I just seen the door
was open there

18:38.233 --> 18:40.167
and thought I'd come in.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.467
Tom, this is Miss Reynolds.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.800
- Miss Reynolds, this is Tom.
- How's it going?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.667
Just showing Miss Reynolds
around her uncle's estate.

18:46.667 --> 18:50.100
Well, technically now,
your estate, I suppose.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.100
Kate.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.600
Well, like I was saying,
I'll leave you at it.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.800
Are you sure you'll be able
to get home on your own?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.667
Yeah. I'll find my way.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.400
Well, I can take you back
if you want.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.733
It's okay, honestly.

19:03.733 --> 19:04.967
Maybe it's best if he does.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.167
Surely, we don't want you
to get lost.

19:09.667 --> 19:13.200
Well, uh, I'll see you
tomorrow.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.500
That is funny.
I recognize this place.

19:18.567 --> 19:21.333
I guess I must have
been here as a kid.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.833
I knew your uncle actually.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.067
- Really?
- Uh-hm. He was a good man.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.067
Took me in for a while then.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.267
I was born around here

19:31.267 --> 19:33.667
but never knew
any of the details.

19:33.667 --> 19:37.233
I lost my, uh, parents
in an accident around here

19:37.233 --> 19:41.600
when I was younger,
and um, I...

19:53.867 --> 19:56.000
Come on, I'll get you
back to the inn.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.233
Just a minute.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.767
Hello?

22:18.067 --> 22:19.800
Tom. Hi.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.333
Hi. I just wanted to
check up on you,

22:21.333 --> 22:22.667
see how you were doing.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.700
How kind! Thank you.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.633
Yeah.
A lot better than yesterday.

22:28.633 --> 22:30.033
I don't know
what happened there.

22:30.033 --> 22:32.067
That's so sweet.
Did you want to come in?

22:32.067 --> 22:34.467
Oh, uh, I didn't want to
invade on your privacy.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.867
No, no! Don't be silly.

22:36.867 --> 22:38.600
Honestly,
I'll just be a minute.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.367
So, you're feeling
better then, yeah?

22:41.367 --> 22:42.867
Yeah. I guess
I must have slept it off.

22:42.867 --> 22:46.800
But that was really weird.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.700
Hey, I'm really sorry
about your shirt.

22:50.967 --> 22:52.533
So where are you off to then?

22:52.533 --> 22:53.933
I'm going to go down
to the village

22:53.933 --> 22:55.167
and see Mr. Kelly.

22:55.167 --> 22:58.133
He, uh, mentioned yesterday
about going over some paperwork.

22:58.133 --> 23:00.467
So, you know,
it will be good to know

23:00.467 --> 23:02.867
what I'm finally
letting myself in for.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.167
How about you?
What are your plans?

23:13.667 --> 23:15.667
I looked at those as well.

23:15.667 --> 23:18.733
And they're rather
strangely familiar.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.833
Well, you see that man there?

23:22.833 --> 23:23.800
Uh-hm.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.367
- That's your uncle.
- Really?

23:25.367 --> 23:28.600
Mmmm. A long time ago,
obviously.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.700
Where are these from?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.667
Oh these? These are just
pictures of people

23:32.667 --> 23:34.500
from around the village.

23:35.533 --> 23:37.967
Community events
and things like that.

23:37.967 --> 23:41.233
It's so small everyone
basically knows everyone.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.200
You might find it strange,
but you'll get used to it.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.467
It's so beautiful here.

23:59.467 --> 24:01.533
And the village itself,
it's really quiet.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.300
It's almost out of time.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.167
I like how quiet it is
around here.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.800
Mmmm.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.800
Things aren't complicated.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
Oh, and they're
not boring either.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.633
At least to the people
that live here.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.767
I can understand that.

24:15.767 --> 24:18.033
So, tell me, how are you
finding the place?

24:18.967 --> 24:22.067
Until today, I haven't really
had a chance to explore.

24:22.067 --> 24:25.667
From what I've seen,
it's quiet and relaxing.

24:25.667 --> 24:29.300
And that's um, that's definitely
what I need right now.

24:30.433 --> 24:32.533
Oh, yeah?

24:32.533 --> 24:33.933
Yeah.

24:33.933 --> 24:36.633
I guess things are just sort of
complicated at the moment.

24:58.567 --> 25:00.800
It doesn't exactly look open.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.300
Well, that's annoying.

25:26.267 --> 25:29.333
Listen, if you're not doing
anything later...

25:29.333 --> 25:30.667
Why don't we go down
to the festival

25:30.667 --> 25:33.267
that they have going on
by the lake?

25:33.267 --> 25:34.667
I mean,
like it's nothing major,

25:34.667 --> 25:37.233
but there'll be
lots of people there.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.267
It'll give you a better feel
of the village.

25:40.767 --> 25:43.100
Show you what the village
is really like.

25:44.767 --> 25:47.200
Aw, come on.
It's going to be fun.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.767
I'll pick you up at 8.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.133
Eight sounds good.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.133
I'll see you then.

25:53.133 --> 25:54.667
All right. See you.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.167
<i>Hello.
Your call cannot be taken</i>

26:08.167 --> 26:09.167
<i>at the moment.</i>

26:09.167 --> 26:12.467
So please leave your message
after the tone.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.467
Hey, it's me.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.700
I've, um, I've not
heard from you.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.133
I guess it's no surprise really.

26:21.133 --> 26:23.067
It's nice here.

26:23.067 --> 26:24.000
A little superstitious

26:24.000 --> 26:25.900
and kind of in the middle
of nowhere.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.633
I'm not sure you'd really
like it anyway, but...

26:28.633 --> 26:32.400
It's been interesting.
And... and I'm all right.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.200
I'm just a little bit
under the weather,

26:34.200 --> 26:36.500
but I'm just checking in.

26:38.067 --> 26:39.233
Hope you're okay.

27:00.067 --> 27:01.933
Oh my God!

27:01.933 --> 27:04.800
Why wouldn't there be
severed heads in the kitchen!

29:55.433 --> 29:56.933
Tom, hey.

29:56.933 --> 29:58.367
Are you okay?

29:58.367 --> 30:00.033
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:00.033 --> 30:02.267
I thought we were meeting
at 8 though.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.733
Yeah, we were.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.600
It's 8:30 now.

30:08.133 --> 30:09.433
Oh God I'm so sorry.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.433
I completely lost track of time.

30:12.433 --> 30:15.200
I was... I was
looking around and um...

30:16.567 --> 30:17.933
Never mind.

30:39.267 --> 30:42.500
It wasn't what I was
expecting at all, you know?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.000
I'm glad we've got surprises.

30:46.933 --> 30:47.933
Thank you.

30:49.367 --> 30:50.533
You're welcome.

30:54.033 --> 30:56.733
I think this is definitely
what I've needed, you know.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.967
Everyone just looks
so happy here.

31:00.967 --> 31:02.967
Hey, come on.
I've got an idea.

31:02.967 --> 31:05.000
Follow me.
Come on.

31:13.233 --> 31:14.933
Want to try some?

31:14.933 --> 31:15.800
A pipe?

31:15.800 --> 31:17.833
There's more to it than that.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.700
It's a local herbal recipe,
you know.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.900
Oh!

31:20.900 --> 31:24.033
Now I know why
everyone's so happy here.

31:24.033 --> 31:25.933
You don't have to try it
if you don't want to obviously.

31:25.933 --> 31:29.033
I didn't want to stand out
more than I already do, do I?

32:29.900 --> 32:31.333
Thank you for tonight.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.133
I'm glad you had fun.

32:34.133 --> 32:35.233
I did.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.200
I haven't for so long,
but...

32:37.200 --> 32:40.133
Tonight was really good.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.567
I should go.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.800
Yeah, you go ahead.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.333
I'll see you soon.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.333
Sleep well.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.333
Hey, Irene, I'm sorry.

34:51.433 --> 34:53.833
Kate, are you ready?

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
Uh-hm.

35:03.933 --> 35:06.633
You're from London,
Miss Duffy?

35:06.633 --> 35:07.800
Yes.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.933
And how long have you been
in Brackenmore?

35:11.933 --> 35:17.033
A couple of days. Sorry.
I got here on Tuesday.

35:17.033 --> 35:21.933
And how well did you know
Allyn Nivonne?

35:21.933 --> 35:23.167
I didn't.

35:23.167 --> 35:24.933
You didn't have
any contact with him

35:24.933 --> 35:28.033
when you arrived or prior?

35:28.033 --> 35:30.567
No, I didn't know him.

35:30.567 --> 35:33.333
Why are you here
in Brackenmore?

35:35.367 --> 35:38.167
My uncle.

35:38.167 --> 35:41.067
I'm here to sort out his things.

35:41.067 --> 35:42.733
Good man, your uncle.

35:42.733 --> 35:44.867
Troubled.

35:44.867 --> 35:47.800
Are you troubled, Miss Duffy?

35:47.800 --> 35:50.200
No!

35:50.200 --> 35:52.667
Mmmm. Where were you tonight?

35:52.667 --> 35:57.233
I was at
the lunar festival outing.

35:57.233 --> 36:00.200
Yes, yes.
My men saw you.

36:02.133 --> 36:05.100
So why would you ask
where I was?

36:05.100 --> 36:07.900
So you met Allyn
at the festival.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.800
No! I don't know him.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.267
I didn't meet him.

36:14.267 --> 36:16.933
I've not met him.

36:18.767 --> 36:20.833
Tell me about the festival.

36:22.967 --> 36:27.933
We... we... we ate
and drank a little.

36:27.933 --> 36:30.333
Maybe he saw me there.

36:30.333 --> 36:33.500
That was it?
You just ate and drank?

36:35.300 --> 36:38.700
And danced, I guess.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.067
Okay. You see,
by all accounts,

36:42.067 --> 36:45.600
you were a little
out of sorts, shall we say.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.033
We...

36:52.033 --> 36:55.833
Smoked a little
of the festival root.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.667
But you didn't meet Allyn?

37:01.667 --> 37:03.233
No.

37:03.233 --> 37:05.967
And you didn't party
with Allyn?

37:08.167 --> 37:11.233
And you didn't invite Allyn
back to yours,

37:11.233 --> 37:14.300
and then things
didn't take a turn,

37:14.300 --> 37:16.700
and he didn't end up
bleeding out

37:16.700 --> 37:17.967
on your bedroom floor?

37:17.967 --> 37:19.433
All right now,
that's enough now.

37:20.633 --> 37:22.067
See?

37:22.067 --> 37:25.167
You come over here from London.

37:25.167 --> 37:29.333
You come to our
quiet little village

37:29.333 --> 37:33.100
and you come
to our little festival.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.433
You drink.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.200
You smoke.

37:36.200 --> 37:42.100
And then one of our village lads
ends up dead.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.767
So, you can understand

37:44.767 --> 37:49.567
why I'm not going to
cradle your head.

37:50.967 --> 37:55.467
See, I knew that boy.

38:45.100 --> 38:46.367
What are you looking at?

38:48.967 --> 38:51.333
Old photos of my uncle.

38:52.333 --> 38:53.333
Umm.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.267
This here.

38:56.267 --> 39:00.400
My uncle and my dad
when they were kids.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.033
This woman here...

39:07.867 --> 39:09.033
That's my Mom.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.100
And this little girl...

39:18.833 --> 39:20.100
I think that's me.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.133
But...

39:23.733 --> 39:25.867
I don't remember any of it.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.367
Or anything that's here, and...

39:33.367 --> 39:36.267
and I don't remember them,
and it's freaking me out.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.900
I can't stay here.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.133
Miss Reynolds.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.567
Uh, so, about the property.

40:24.567 --> 40:25.933
I want to sell it.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.067
Well, I'm afraid
it's not really that simple.

40:30.067 --> 40:31.067
Why?

40:32.367 --> 40:34.467
Well, you see,
we have to determine first

40:34.467 --> 40:37.333
if your uncle left
any outstanding debts.

40:37.333 --> 40:39.700
And well, then after that,
there's all the paperwork

40:39.700 --> 40:42.233
and then we'll have to make sure
that that's all done correctly

40:42.233 --> 40:45.267
so it transfers
over to you properly.

40:45.267 --> 40:47.967
Isn't that something that
you should have started already?

40:47.967 --> 40:49.367
Well, you see,
I was waiting to hear

40:49.367 --> 40:51.900
from the next of kin...
yourself...

40:51.900 --> 40:53.733
as how to proceed.

40:53.733 --> 40:55.000
How long is it going to take?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.667
Well, um, I'll have to make
a few inquiries first.

40:58.667 --> 41:01.300
And like I say if there's
nothing outstanding a few days.

41:01.300 --> 41:06.933
And well, if there is, it...
it might take a little longer.

41:06.933 --> 41:10.833
But you'll be the first to know.

41:10.833 --> 41:13.100
Yeah. Of course, I will.

41:42.467 --> 41:43.467
Come on.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.800
Answer it.

41:59.300 --> 42:00.500
Hey.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.500
Sorry about that.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.800
There's no need for you
to be sorry.

42:06.700 --> 42:07.933
I understand that.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.167
Can you take me back
to the guest house, please.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.567
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

42:17.100 --> 42:19.367
I just want to get my things.

42:51.567 --> 42:53.067
Are you sure about this?

42:56.733 --> 42:57.900
Yeah.

43:27.033 --> 43:28.100
Irene!

43:30.567 --> 43:32.200
Irene!

43:47.400 --> 43:51.700
<i>Hi. I got your messages.</i>

43:51.700 --> 43:53.967
<i>I'm really worried about you.</i>

43:55.000 --> 43:57.033
<i>Anyway, I'm here.</i>

43:57.033 --> 43:58.333
<i>I arrived this morning.</i>

43:59.433 --> 44:00.433
<i>Where are you?</i>

44:02.400 --> 44:07.100
<i>Look, Kate,
I found the pregnancy test.</i>

44:09.833 --> 44:11.233
<i>I wish you'd told me.</i>

44:11.233 --> 44:13.600
<i>I mean, this is
a good thing, you know.</i>

44:13.600 --> 44:15.467
<i>We can start fresh.</i>

44:15.467 --> 44:18.000
<i>Look, please just call me.
We need to talk.</i>

44:37.500 --> 44:39.000
Can I help you?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.900
I'm uh... well, I'm looking
for a place to stay.

44:45.433 --> 44:48.767
This, uh, this is
the guest house, right?

44:48.767 --> 44:50.500
No.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.367
Oh, oh.
Well, it's just, um...

44:53.367 --> 44:54.900
I mean, the sign on the street
back there,

44:54.900 --> 44:56.667
it points this way.

44:56.667 --> 44:59.267
It was. It isn't anymore.

44:59.267 --> 45:01.100
The sign is old.

45:01.100 --> 45:03.900
Right. Well, um, I mean,

45:03.900 --> 45:06.267
do you know of anywhere else
in town I could stay?

45:06.267 --> 45:07.433
No.

45:07.433 --> 45:08.533
Right.

45:11.533 --> 45:12.733
Well, thanks.

45:12.733 --> 45:15.400
You've, uh, you've been
a lot of help.

45:21.367 --> 45:23.867
<i>This was meant to be
stress-free.</i>

45:27.367 --> 45:30.100
<i>Meant to be a break
from all the other shit.</i>

45:33.067 --> 45:34.067
Sorry.

45:36.433 --> 45:37.933
No, that's fine.

45:38.933 --> 45:40.467
God knows what he's doing.

45:43.433 --> 45:44.433
Or who.

45:45.367 --> 45:49.067
And he's sorry.
I know he is, but...

45:49.067 --> 45:51.233
It's not enough, you know?

45:53.033 --> 45:56.367
'Cause he did cheat,
and he messed up.

46:00.167 --> 46:02.300
He was trying really hard.

46:03.867 --> 46:07.833
The more he tries,
the more I hate him.

46:12.167 --> 46:15.533
Oh, it just
makes me feel guilty

46:15.533 --> 46:18.067
because he's trying so hard.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.933
You know it's not good
to feel guilty now.

46:30.133 --> 46:31.233
I know.

46:34.667 --> 46:35.867
But I do.

46:37.967 --> 46:39.833
I just can't forgive him.

46:42.433 --> 46:44.967
There's no way
I'm strong enough.

46:46.933 --> 46:49.333
Oh, come on.

46:49.333 --> 46:51.433
After everything
you've been through?

46:53.167 --> 46:55.267
I've never met anyone stronger.

47:00.733 --> 47:02.133
I'm not strong.

47:04.967 --> 47:06.267
Yes, you are.

47:10.300 --> 47:11.600
More than you know.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.533
Okay.

47:26.533 --> 47:28.200
Change of plan.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.767
You're going to have a drink.

47:29.767 --> 47:30.767
I know I want one,

47:30.767 --> 47:32.300
and you sure as fucking
need one!

47:32.300 --> 47:35.933
Okay.

48:10.567 --> 48:12.300
Did you find anything?

48:16.133 --> 48:17.200
Tom?

48:41.033 --> 48:42.100
Tom?

49:05.767 --> 49:08.233
No, no!

49:12.767 --> 49:15.067
No, no!

49:51.233 --> 49:52.367
I'm sorry, Kate.

49:55.333 --> 49:56.500
I really am.

50:10.300 --> 50:13.900
These must appear
very strange to you,

50:13.900 --> 50:15.800
these death masks.

50:24.567 --> 50:26.767
Tom, I'm scared...

50:26.767 --> 50:29.200
and I don't want to be here.

50:30.033 --> 50:31.200
Tom, I want to leave.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.033
There's a lot of things
you don't understand

50:32.033 --> 50:33.733
about our traditions.

50:33.733 --> 50:36.633
Things that outsiders
would call pagan.

50:36.633 --> 50:37.800
I want to leave.

50:39.067 --> 50:41.433
- I won't say anything.
- It's all relative, I suppose.

50:41.433 --> 50:42.267
I promise.

50:42.267 --> 50:43.567
Some people
have lost their way.

50:43.567 --> 50:44.700
I want to put this all
behind me.

50:44.700 --> 50:46.767
They have lost sight
of what's important.

50:46.767 --> 50:48.533
- I don't want to be a part...
- Family.

50:48.533 --> 50:50.033
...of this anymore.

50:50.033 --> 50:53.633
You're not just part of this.
You're the whole of it.

50:53.633 --> 50:55.700
This is all about you.

50:55.700 --> 50:59.000
Okay. Please, let me go.

51:01.433 --> 51:02.433
Please.

51:02.433 --> 51:04.700
There is no one
more important than you.

51:04.700 --> 51:06.333
No one.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.600
You've just forgotten.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.500
Forgotten what?

51:10.500 --> 51:13.133
Your role here.

51:13.133 --> 51:16.300
You've seen it
in those pictures.

51:16.300 --> 51:19.867
Many people
would call it superstition...

51:19.867 --> 51:21.867
But they don't know
what's coming.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.567
We do.

51:24.567 --> 51:28.133
And you do too.
You've seen it.

51:28.133 --> 51:30.233
You were chosen
a long time ago.

51:34.333 --> 51:35.833
You don't even know me.

51:37.633 --> 51:39.267
I do.

51:39.267 --> 51:41.633
I was there
the night of the crash.

51:41.633 --> 51:45.600
What are you
talking about?

51:45.600 --> 51:50.067
Your uncle, he understood
what needed to be done.

51:50.067 --> 51:53.700
That's why there was no way
out of the crash.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.667
You knew they were
about to leave

51:55.667 --> 51:57.700
and you wouldn't let them.

51:57.700 --> 52:02.000
Your uncle sacrificed himself
so that you may return here.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.700
But you have forgotten
everything.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.833
This is insane!

52:06.833 --> 52:09.067
Believe me, it's not.

52:21.067 --> 52:24.500
We are the messengers.
You have the mark.

52:29.967 --> 52:31.467
You'll pretend
that you haven't it,

52:31.467 --> 52:33.633
but I know that you do.

52:33.633 --> 52:38.600
Unfortunately, you have
forgotten its significance.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.700
You have forgotten your part.

52:40.700 --> 52:42.767
That is why
Allyn went to your room.

52:42.767 --> 52:44.000
He was a true believer.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.800
He did what needed to be done.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.667
He was ready
to lay down his life

52:47.667 --> 52:48.900
to bring that part of you out.

52:48.900 --> 52:51.900
If you hadn't run away,
you'd have welcomed this.

52:51.900 --> 52:54.167
You'd have been willing.

52:54.167 --> 52:57.767
You'd have been revered
like all those before you.

52:57.767 --> 53:00.833
But that's just not
going to happen, is it?

53:00.833 --> 53:02.467
I'm sorry.

53:02.467 --> 53:05.300
This is not going to be
pleasant for you.

53:09.467 --> 53:12.467
Somebody!

54:05.000 --> 54:07.267
- Hello.
- Oh, hi there.

54:07.267 --> 54:08.100
Um, um...

54:08.100 --> 54:09.767
Come in.
Come in, come in!

54:09.767 --> 54:11.467
Okay. Sure.

54:17.533 --> 54:18.800
Thanks.

54:20.933 --> 54:23.400
So, how might I help you?

54:23.400 --> 54:24.667
Well, um, yeah.

54:24.667 --> 54:25.967
I was wondering
if you could help me.

54:25.967 --> 54:27.933
Actually, I'm looking
for my wife Kate.

54:27.933 --> 54:30.600
Kate Reynolds.
I think she stopped by here.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.100
Kate Reynolds?

54:33.100 --> 54:35.667
Sorry, that name
doesn't sound familiar.

54:35.667 --> 54:38.333
I mean, it's just... we...
we got this letter from you

54:38.333 --> 54:40.333
about the passing
of her uncle's estate.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.400
Oh!

54:44.467 --> 54:45.767
Yes.

54:45.767 --> 54:47.667
Yes, this lady called in,

54:47.667 --> 54:50.067
but I wouldn't know
where she is now.

54:50.067 --> 54:53.233
Oh, well, do you think she
might be at her uncle's place?

54:53.233 --> 54:54.933
Oh, no.
She wouldn't be there.

54:54.933 --> 54:58.867
Sure, I have the keys,
and she wouldn't be there.

54:58.867 --> 55:00.267
All the same, do you think
I could grab the address?

55:00.267 --> 55:01.600
It's just that
I'd like to visit...

55:01.600 --> 55:04.800
I'm sorry. I can't give out
that kind of information.

55:04.800 --> 55:05.867
But I'm her husband.

55:05.867 --> 55:08.333
All the same.

55:08.333 --> 55:10.567
I mean, I... I could just
look it up, you know.

55:10.567 --> 55:12.300
Well, if you think
it might help.

55:12.300 --> 55:13.733
No, it really would help
if you...

55:13.733 --> 55:14.900
if you could just give me
the address.

55:14.900 --> 55:16.200
Look, perhaps you should
ring her up.

55:16.200 --> 55:17.833
Maybe that might be
the right thing to do.

55:17.833 --> 55:20.267
Yes. She's not
picking up her phone.

55:20.267 --> 55:24.600
Ah! Well, sorry sir.
I can't help you.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.500
Well, is there no one who's
at least seen her arrive and...

55:28.633 --> 55:30.900
- Mr. Reynolds.
- Hello.

55:30.900 --> 55:32.300
My name is
Superintendent Garrett,

55:32.300 --> 55:35.433
and I'm in charge of the local
police force around here.

55:35.433 --> 55:36.533
I'm sorry to have to tell you

55:36.533 --> 55:39.167
that your wife has been involved
in an incident

55:39.167 --> 55:42.467
which has resulted in the death
of a young man in the village.

55:42.467 --> 55:43.633
I'm sorry, what?

55:43.633 --> 55:46.767
It would appear that Ms. Duffy
has fled the community.

55:46.767 --> 55:48.400
No, no. There must be
some sort of mistake.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.333
My wife's name is Reynolds.

55:49.333 --> 55:52.300
No, no. I'm afraid
there is no mistake,

55:52.300 --> 55:53.267
and I have to ask you

55:53.267 --> 55:55.700
if you have any knowledge
of her whereabouts.

55:55.700 --> 55:57.767
Well, no, I don't know
where Kate is.

55:57.767 --> 55:59.367
That's the thing.
I'm here looking for her.

55:59.367 --> 56:00.833
She's not picking up her phone
or anything...

56:00.833 --> 56:03.267
Has there been anything
going on between you

56:03.267 --> 56:06.733
that could have resulted
in this outburst?

56:06.733 --> 56:07.900
Excuse me?

56:09.000 --> 56:12.767
Has there been anything
going on between you

56:12.767 --> 56:17.133
that could have resulted
in this outburst?

56:17.133 --> 56:21.367
- An affair maybe?
- Look, I...

56:21.367 --> 56:24.267
I don't know who you are
or what you...

56:30.333 --> 56:31.333
What the...?

56:34.633 --> 56:35.800
Where did you um...

56:37.167 --> 56:40.500
how did you get...
What the fuck is going on here?

56:40.500 --> 56:41.500
Steven!

56:42.967 --> 56:44.533
Welcome to Brackenmore.

57:12.467 --> 57:13.467
How are you doing?

57:20.700 --> 57:22.067
Kate, look at me.

57:32.500 --> 57:34.433
Do I look dead inside to you?

57:41.267 --> 57:42.500
You're my sister.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.433
I've waited to see you
my whole life.

57:52.233 --> 57:54.367
I never asked for us
to be separated.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.500
All I ever wanted
was for us to be family again.

58:06.267 --> 58:09.500
I know none of this makes
any sense to you, I know.

58:14.400 --> 58:16.133
I really am sorry for this.

58:29.900 --> 58:32.400
No!
No, no, no, no!

58:32.400 --> 58:33.833
Don't do this!

58:33.833 --> 58:35.233
You want me, take me,

58:35.233 --> 58:37.600
but please leave him
out of this.

58:37.600 --> 58:39.133
I'll be whoever
you need me to be.

58:39.133 --> 58:41.467
Just please leave him alone!

58:44.200 --> 58:46.033
Just please leave him alone.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.500
No!

58:52.700 --> 58:54.433
I wish I didn't
have to do this, Kate.

58:54.433 --> 58:56.967
Please don't!
Please don't do this!

58:56.967 --> 58:58.033
You don't have to do this!

58:58.033 --> 59:00.900
You... you're the one
that's in control.

59:02.167 --> 59:04.067
Tom, Tom!

59:04.067 --> 59:04.933
No!

59:04.933 --> 59:06.467
No!

59:08.800 --> 59:10.600
Tom!

59:11.700 --> 59:13.200
I love you so much!

59:14.267 --> 59:17.367
Fuck you! Fuck you!

59:18.800 --> 59:20.233
I'm sorry!

59:23.100 --> 59:24.100
I'm sorry!

59:29.600 --> 59:32.233
- Please!
- Fuck you!

59:43.467 --> 59:46.933
I'm so sorry!

01:02:21.733 --> 01:02:22.933
We are gathered here,

01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:26.800
a desperate lot,
with nowhere else to turn.

01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:30.533
We stand on the precipice
of a new world.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.133
She will bring new life.

01:02:35.133 --> 01:02:38.667
She will bring new prosperity
and protection

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.933
in a world that is forgotten.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:45.067
When we were chosen
for this path,

01:02:45.067 --> 01:02:48.800
chosen long before
you and I were born,

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.500
in the days of the old gods.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.500
And we must never forget
what we have sacrificed

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.933
to usher in this new world.

01:02:59.933 --> 01:03:02.367
I am not unaware
of where these actions

01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:06.233
may take me after I die,
but that does not matter.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:10.033
What matters is
that we have the strength

01:03:10.033 --> 01:03:13.400
within ourselves
to do what we must.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.433
To know that this is
the right way, the only way.

01:03:21.767 --> 01:03:26.167
Today is a dark day,
and we must never forget

01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:29.133
what we have
sacrificed here today

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:32.367
to usher in this new world.

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.100
Neela.

01:04:37.733 --> 01:04:40.233
New prosperity.

01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:42.067
New life.

01:05:06.633 --> 01:05:07.933
Forgive me.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.367
It is done.

01:07:00.067 --> 01:07:01.533
Christ!

01:07:01.533 --> 01:07:03.167
No!

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:04.167
No!

01:07:05.967 --> 01:07:08.000
Help me!

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.767
For the love of God, please.

01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:12.300
Help me, please!

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.900
Stop it! Stop it!

01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:26.333
This thing.
It's a part of me,

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:29.033
and it's protected me
my entire life.
