<i>Hitman Two, Enrage Three One.
We're checking in with you.</i>

00:02.136 --> 00:04.616
<i>Roger. We just got...
We just had contact.</i>

00:04.736 --> 00:06.286
<i>Stand by for six-line.</i>

00:07.236 --> 00:09.586
<i>Enrage Three One, we're ready to copy.</i>

00:09.798 --> 00:13.448
<i>Before I give you the six-line,
do you have a visual on our pos?</i>

00:14.375 --> 00:16.386
I need some more. 50 cal ammo!

00:18.159 --> 00:19.367
Jesus Christ.

00:21.153 --> 00:22.703
That's a lot of city.

00:23.154 --> 00:24.574
We're not careful,

00:24.830 --> 00:26.723
we'd get lost in this here.

00:30.186 --> 00:32.302
Redman, where's the forty mike-mike?

00:33.966 --> 00:37.391
Street after street, alley after alley.
Look at it.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.033
You thought those little towns
a kilometer long were tough.

00:40.153 --> 00:42.098
You heard the radio traffic
on the way in.

00:42.218 --> 00:44.410
Still got fedayeen sniping
at American units down there.

00:44.530 --> 00:46.160
So where are we headed exactly?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.866
This area right here,

00:48.219 --> 00:50.571
a shia slum called Saddam City.

00:50.691 --> 00:51.540
Saddam City?

00:52.034 --> 00:53.521
Need to rename that bitch.

00:53.641 --> 00:57.416
<i>All Hitman Victors, this is Hitman
actual. We are red-con one in 5 mikes.</i>

00:57.589 --> 01:00.080
Roger that, Hitman.
We're Oscar Mike in five mikes.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.553
Mount up! We're on the road, boys!

01:02.804 --> 01:04.224
- All right.
- Oscar mike!

01:04.343 --> 01:05.919
- Gear up, team Two!
- Ray.

01:09.781 --> 01:11.231
Dude, check it out.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.480
I wrote "U.S.A." with my piss.

02:04.643 --> 02:07.271
Hitman Three Two actual,
this is Hitman Two One actual.

02:08.155 --> 02:09.607
<i>This is Three Two actual.</i>

02:09.768 --> 02:11.678
<i>- Send it.
- Get me Kocher.</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:14.161
<i>He is no longer on this team. Over.</i>

02:14.281 --> 02:15.231
Say again.

02:16.358 --> 02:19.367
<i>Be advised:
the team leader's been fired. Over.</i>

02:21.155 --> 02:22.605
Can't raise Kocher?

02:23.405 --> 02:25.455
He's not riding with Three Two.

02:27.716 --> 02:30.461
<i>Were you guys singing
King of the road without me?</i>

02:32.966 --> 02:34.910
<i>Hitman actual, this is Godfather.</i>

02:35.030 --> 02:38.268
<i>Battalion ops is arranging staging areas
for the companies. Over.</i>

02:38.388 --> 02:40.034
<i>Copy that, Godfather.</i>

02:42.340 --> 02:44.190
Hail the conquering heroes!

02:45.279 --> 02:47.228
It's General Mattis's arrogant bastards!

02:48.116 --> 02:49.710
All hail first recon!

02:54.326 --> 02:55.339
Fuck yeah!

02:55.657 --> 02:56.851
Show us your tits!

02:56.971 --> 02:58.531
Dance, you pretty bitch!

03:00.158 --> 03:01.787
Brad, what the hell is this?

03:01.907 --> 03:04.038
The fuck's all this silver paper
they're throwing at us?

03:04.158 --> 03:06.474
- Cigarette factory.
- Anyone got a match?

03:06.594 --> 03:08.603
Where they make these Iraqi shit sticks.

03:08.723 --> 03:10.133
Compliments of your new billet.

03:10.253 --> 03:12.225
If these were Marlboros,
we'd be fuckin' rich.

03:12.345 --> 03:15.674
Fuckin' haji cigarettes.
Next we'll all be eating raghead pussy.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.926
This has got to be the biggest cloud
of secondhand smoke ever.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.539
They fuckin' execute people
for shit like this in California.

03:22.659 --> 03:25.725
T.L.S, looks like
we're staging the vehicles outside.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.857
Gunny, what's the drill here?

03:34.407 --> 03:36.538
We've been digging holes every night.

03:36.658 --> 03:38.108
Combat's over, Rudy.

03:38.722 --> 03:41.172
Besides, you can't dig through concrete.

03:41.407 --> 03:42.225
Dirty,

03:42.985 --> 03:44.760
what the fuck is going on?

03:45.364 --> 03:47.540
Kocher and Redman,
you gotta hear it from them.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.910
They're back with motor T, Colbert.

03:50.094 --> 03:50.944
Motor T?

03:57.094 --> 03:59.144
<i>Roger that, Hitman Three actual.</i>

04:04.286 --> 04:06.736
Buddy, where do I find Sergeant Kocher?

04:09.284 --> 04:10.134
Thanks.

04:10.503 --> 04:12.601
I think the belt's fucked.

04:12.721 --> 04:14.971
Dawson, get your fat ass over here.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.613
Well, Brad,
how do you like my new M.O.S.?

04:22.158 --> 04:23.508
I'm a fucking pog.

04:24.195 --> 04:25.745
At least we got tunes.

04:26.072 --> 04:28.722
It's gangster back here
with the pogs, dude.

04:28.907 --> 04:30.157
What's going on?

04:30.277 --> 04:31.824
He ain't team leader no more.

04:31.944 --> 04:33.502
Because of that E.P.W. takedown,

04:34.071 --> 04:36.936
the one where Captain America was trying
to get us to help bayonet the haji.

04:37.582 --> 04:39.298
He tries to stick the dude, we stop him.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.810
We get suspended.

04:41.783 --> 04:44.428
- Fuck.
- Them reservists reported our unit.

04:44.721 --> 04:46.974
The same first Sergeant
who shook my hand

04:47.094 --> 04:51.093
and told me I saved his life when
I pulled that E.P.W. out of the bushes

04:51.531 --> 04:53.396
writes up a report
saying we're all involved.

04:53.558 --> 04:56.315
We were trying to stop the Captain,
now I'm a war criminal?

04:56.477 --> 04:58.164
Battalion's got a full inquiry.

04:58.284 --> 04:59.821
Godfather's on it personally.

04:59.941 --> 05:02.227
Why is the Captain
still commanding the platoon?

05:02.347 --> 05:03.697
They relieved him.

05:03.907 --> 05:05.457
For about 20 minutes.

05:05.657 --> 05:07.104
Then reinstated him.

05:07.450 --> 05:10.496
Seems like officers don't like
to suspend other officers.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.295
Every one of us,
we get paid to brutalize people.

05:14.787 --> 05:16.919
But our Captain,
he's brutal to the wrong people.

05:17.345 --> 05:19.595
Eric, I'm not gonna stand for this.

05:21.033 --> 05:22.383
I'll request mast.

05:22.545 --> 05:24.295
You know where to find us.

05:30.771 --> 05:31.673
Brad,

05:32.554 --> 05:34.101
you heard, didn't you?

05:34.221 --> 05:36.832
I'm not gonna stand for my men
being fucked like this.

05:36.952 --> 05:39.845
My uncle's a full-bird Colonel
at centcom and I'm contacting him.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.280
- I'm hiring a lawyer. For all of us.
- For all of you?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.789
The important thing,
is that Eric and Redman hang together.

05:45.909 --> 05:47.908
We don't want them
talking on their own.

05:48.605 --> 05:50.084
Eric looks up to you.

05:50.771 --> 05:52.846
Let him know I gotta take the lead.

05:52.966 --> 05:54.832
Sir, at the risk
of speaking out of turn,

05:55.533 --> 05:58.169
it seems to me those men might not share
the same interests as you.

05:59.530 --> 06:00.898
They're suspended

06:01.792 --> 06:03.841
- and you're not.
- Beyond my control.

06:05.767 --> 06:06.595
You know,

06:07.487 --> 06:09.306
the marine corps promised
to watch our backs.

06:09.466 --> 06:11.721
They said that we would be held
accountable to facts

06:11.841 --> 06:15.687
not as they are in hindsight
but as they appeared to us at the time.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.882
They told us that going in.

06:19.783 --> 06:21.567
And now they're hanging us out to dry.

06:23.907 --> 06:24.707
Yeah.

06:28.907 --> 06:32.370
"First recon will conduct military
operations in and around Saddam City,

06:32.698 --> 06:35.207
"to include patrols
that establish the American presence,

06:35.651 --> 06:38.235
"stop the looting,
and restore a sense of security

06:38.355 --> 06:41.380
"in order to allow critical
life-sustaining functions to take place.

06:42.822 --> 06:45.244
"The intent is to locate key facilities
in our zones

06:45.364 --> 06:46.760
"such as schools and hospitals,

06:47.147 --> 06:48.892
"to collect intelligence on fedayeen

06:49.012 --> 06:51.041
"and ba'ath loyalists
who are still at large,

06:51.161 --> 06:54.351
"and to prevent lawlessness
and disarm the populace.

06:54.719 --> 06:58.369
"The end state is a humble
competent force occupying this area,

06:58.705 --> 07:02.702
"ensuring security and mutual trust
between us and the local populace. "

07:06.697 --> 07:08.906
We have rolled through this country
fucking things up.

07:11.695 --> 07:14.933
And now we have to show these people
what we liberated them for.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.850
Marines have been here for about 24 h.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.017
They've set up on the other side
of this warehouse.

07:23.137 --> 07:26.165
They've had one killed and one wounded
from sniper and mortar fire,

07:26.285 --> 07:28.300
so keep your P.P.E. on at all times.

07:30.846 --> 07:33.724
Those are navy seal snipers set up
on the top floor of the office tower.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.735
And judging from their rate of fire,

07:35.855 --> 07:37.973
dropping a bad guy
every five or 10 minutes.

07:38.093 --> 07:40.025
But compared to where we've been,

07:40.145 --> 07:42.094
I think it's pretty safe here.

07:42.214 --> 07:43.858
We should all get a good night's rest.

07:45.534 --> 07:46.484
That's it.

07:52.034 --> 07:54.284
A fuckin' car bomb at the main gate.

07:54.518 --> 07:57.580
Motherfuckers from One Five are
lighting up the street like it's cool.

07:58.384 --> 08:00.249
Should we go help them out?

08:07.719 --> 08:10.769
Looks like I was wrong
about that good night's rest.

08:13.962 --> 08:16.223
No purple heart, no disability
check for you, reporter.

08:17.344 --> 08:19.560
- Waste of a good bullet.
- This is definitely not good.

08:33.993 --> 08:35.301
Not good at all.

08:36.845 --> 08:37.645
Fuck!

08:53.596 --> 08:55.046
Who's on watch next?

08:55.659 --> 08:57.852
- Lilley and Leon.
- Where's their racks at?

08:57.972 --> 09:01.601
Everyone in Bravo will stand up
and testify as to his incompetence.

09:01.721 --> 09:03.971
He has a fullbird uncle at Centcom.

09:05.346 --> 09:07.496
I'm sure he's mentioned it to you.

09:08.031 --> 09:10.181
There's nothing to be done, Brad,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.488
just suck it up and smile.

10:10.616 --> 10:11.744
Combat jack?

10:12.192 --> 10:13.642
No, I tried to shit.

10:13.944 --> 10:17.336
I was looking for a place,
I ended up out by the front gate.

10:17.456 --> 10:19.806
People started shooting at each other.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.664
I think I heard an Iraqi get shot
right in front of me.

10:28.430 --> 10:29.356
It's too bad.

10:29.816 --> 10:31.859
He probably would have liked democracy.

10:34.729 --> 10:36.248
Is that all you got?

10:48.944 --> 10:49.944
Mail call.

10:56.368 --> 10:57.315
Lilley.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.766
- Chaffin.
- Here.

11:01.631 --> 11:03.683
- Espera.
- Yo, dawg.

11:03.843 --> 11:06.972
- Fuck, all I got is bills.
- Brah, they repo'ed my car.

11:07.092 --> 11:09.242
Don't they know you're a war hero?

11:09.468 --> 11:10.273
Fuck.

11:11.272 --> 11:13.943
- Got a letter from my wife here.
- What's wrong with that?

11:15.650 --> 11:16.863
It came from a lawyer.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.838
Damn, dawg.

11:19.359 --> 11:20.477
That's cold.

11:21.349 --> 11:24.386
She wants to take my kids with her
back to Reno.

11:27.642 --> 11:28.874
Everything okay?

11:29.447 --> 11:31.131
Yeah, she's been taking

11:31.853 --> 11:33.447
Jessie to dance class.

11:34.124 --> 11:36.632
She's been managing the house okay,
she sent her love.

11:38.419 --> 11:39.627
It's all good, dawg.

11:39.747 --> 11:42.057
My wife says she misses me so much.

11:43.134 --> 11:44.065
She says

11:44.403 --> 11:47.352
she's gonna join the Marines
so we can be closer.

11:47.718 --> 11:49.620
She already signed the papers.

11:49.740 --> 11:50.942
What the fuck?

11:51.231 --> 11:52.902
She'll get sent straight to motor T

11:53.022 --> 11:55.316
so she can get airtighted
by three niggers.

11:55.436 --> 11:57.069
She'll look like a fucking cumdragon.

11:57.642 --> 12:00.325
I'd like to call in some danger-close
on my wife,

12:00.445 --> 12:01.865
that's for fucking sure.

12:04.172 --> 12:07.830
And maybe fly some Cobras
right up her fucking lawyer's ass too!

12:09.459 --> 12:10.958
Ain't all joy and happiness is it?

12:11.646 --> 12:13.796
Mail call kind of brings it home.

12:16.341 --> 12:19.132
If morale gets really bad, Mike,
let me know.

12:20.215 --> 12:23.056
I'll stir 'em up good
with the grooming standard.

12:23.658 --> 12:25.066
I'll let you know.

12:27.732 --> 12:31.018
This was apparently
Uday and Qusay's cigarette factory.

12:31.275 --> 12:35.035
They exported 20 brands of cigarettes
and made almost $50 million a year.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.963
Sounds like you've been doing
some research.

12:38.456 --> 12:41.235
I might write a book one day.
What about you?

12:42.053 --> 12:44.037
Yeah, I mean, I got so much...

12:44.694 --> 12:46.563
We need help. We need help.

12:47.454 --> 12:49.455
- We understand.
- Please, stop the looting.

12:50.297 --> 12:52.847
Listen, order will be restored
very soon.

12:58.902 --> 13:01.352
This is what we were talking about, sir.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.584
It's the only place in the compound
not covered by this three-meter wall,

13:05.704 --> 13:07.097
just this chain-link fence.

13:10.412 --> 13:11.952
Reporter, get down!

13:14.625 --> 13:16.815
- Sniper. He's in front of us.
- How can you tell?

13:17.633 --> 13:21.570
You can only hear that clearly when
you're in front of the rifle barrel.

13:21.731 --> 13:22.762
That zip

13:23.045 --> 13:25.115
means it's passing
a few meters from our ears.

13:25.276 --> 13:26.473
One at a time.

13:26.593 --> 13:28.160
- Colbert, go.
- Bounding!

13:32.769 --> 13:34.290
- Set!
- I got no muzzle flashes.

13:34.410 --> 13:35.752
- Rudy, go!
- Bounding!

13:41.709 --> 13:42.842
- Set!
- Lovell, go!

13:43.002 --> 13:43.952
Bounding!

13:46.295 --> 13:47.430
- Set!
- Poke, go!

13:47.757 --> 13:48.725
Bounding!

13:52.249 --> 13:53.645
- Set!
- Reporter, you ready?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.267
- Yes!
- Go!

14:10.232 --> 14:11.435
What the fuck?

14:15.002 --> 14:16.002
Set, sir!

14:18.747 --> 14:19.824
All up, sir.

14:20.665 --> 14:22.256
Reporter, what the fuck was that?

14:23.761 --> 14:25.711
<i>Serpentine, shell, serpentine.</i>

14:26.485 --> 14:28.471
<i>You know, the movie The In-laws.</i>

14:30.572 --> 14:34.422
Peter Falk tells Alan Arkin,
"Always run in a serpentine fashion. "

14:34.777 --> 14:37.313
- I was running evasively.
- The next time we come under fire,

14:37.602 --> 14:40.482
run in a straight line.
You'll live longer.

14:40.643 --> 14:42.562
And have a full happy life
of betraying us

14:42.682 --> 14:44.732
and others with your venal lies.

14:46.274 --> 14:48.923
This place is crawling
with fucking grunts.

14:49.043 --> 14:51.290
Looks like my fucking high school, man.

14:51.410 --> 14:52.426
I don't get it.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.903
We're sending out one patrol a day?

14:55.534 --> 14:58.268
It's Charlie today, us tomorrow,
and then,

14:58.388 --> 14:59.901
Alpha goes day after.

15:00.021 --> 15:03.338
How the fuck are we supposed to take
over Baghdad on one patrol a day?

15:03.896 --> 15:06.293
It's because battalion
only got one translator.

15:06.413 --> 15:09.051
Meesh can only go out
one patrol at a time.

15:09.171 --> 15:10.171
Gentlemen.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.606
First Battalion Fourth Marines
have occupied this structure.

15:13.726 --> 15:17.476
Respectfully, you are asked
to Ratfuck some other establishment.

15:25.742 --> 15:27.892
Ricky recon, you have a nice day.

15:36.045 --> 15:37.708
Who the fuck they think they are?

15:37.828 --> 15:40.500
- They got there first is all.
- Yeah, fuck that.

16:22.675 --> 16:23.803
Hells yeah.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.409
Jackpot!

17:15.958 --> 17:17.865
Damn, look at all this stuff.

17:17.984 --> 17:18.984
Hells yeah.

17:19.176 --> 17:21.415
Bring in my big-legged secretary.

17:21.535 --> 17:23.172
Now, right away. Send her in.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.088
And tell her to bring me a coffee.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.363
And a blowjob with extra slobber.

17:32.736 --> 17:34.591
- Shit, man!
- Fuck it!

17:34.711 --> 17:36.669
Captain America made me
a war criminal anyway?

17:36.789 --> 17:37.848
Damn right.

17:39.864 --> 17:42.191
This is like that holiday
dirty Earl is always talking about,

17:42.311 --> 17:45.293
the one where the working man
gets to fuck the rich man's shit up!

17:49.189 --> 17:50.465
- Hell no!
- Hell no!

17:52.287 --> 17:53.508
You heinous, dawg!

18:05.090 --> 18:07.211
Let's get the fuck out of here.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.320
Nice.

18:41.759 --> 18:43.705
America good. Saddam no good.

18:44.021 --> 18:46.948
No jobs. You want anything, bribes.
No good. No good.

18:47.068 --> 18:50.408
We have nothing to do but talk,
play dominos, smoke.

18:50.528 --> 18:52.448
- Saddam was an asshole!
- Want a cigarette?

18:52.568 --> 18:53.970
Life is very hard.

18:54.345 --> 18:56.682
- Smoke?
- Yeah, thanks.

18:56.842 --> 18:58.018
You have Valium?

18:58.138 --> 18:59.588
- Valium?
- Valium.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.239
No, no.

19:01.359 --> 19:03.505
- Because I can't sleep at night.
- Really? Why?

19:03.625 --> 19:05.928
And the store to buy liquor
has been closed

19:06.048 --> 19:07.682
since the bombing has been started.

19:07.802 --> 19:10.528
That's horrible. I got some uppers
if you want to party all night.

19:11.054 --> 19:12.991
- Valium.
- No, just uppers.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.361
- No downers.
- No, Valium. Valium.

19:16.259 --> 19:17.259
Valium...

19:25.750 --> 19:26.878
Groovy my brother.

19:34.313 --> 19:35.501
Check it, bro.

19:36.734 --> 19:39.238
The men are all sitting around
talking shit,

19:39.358 --> 19:41.173
and the women are all working.

19:41.345 --> 19:44.479
If we fight the women instead of
the men, we'd get our asses kicked.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.524
Man, they act like
they actually want us here.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.396
Let me see under glasses.

19:52.137 --> 19:53.531
You have beautiful eyes.

19:55.401 --> 19:56.701
You like boys or girls?

19:57.247 --> 19:58.319
Girls, dawg.

19:59.104 --> 19:59.910
Girls?

20:01.086 --> 20:02.509
Go with my friend.

20:02.852 --> 20:04.001
You'll like.

20:04.674 --> 20:05.453
Walt.

20:06.787 --> 20:10.180
- I think we got a light one here.
- Just smile like it's all good.

20:15.356 --> 20:16.722
He liked you, bro.

20:20.638 --> 20:21.998
It's a long list.

20:22.613 --> 20:25.187
Unexploded munitions,
lack of electricity,

20:25.347 --> 20:28.038
no running water,
broken phone lines,

20:28.350 --> 20:31.861
ransacked hospitals, and bandits
coming through at night, robbing homes.

20:32.725 --> 20:34.256
And they want jobs.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.589
Is that all?

20:38.638 --> 20:39.790
Yeah, for now.

20:40.187 --> 20:41.919
- Let's mount 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.372
All right, mount up!

20:44.509 --> 20:45.875
We're Oscar Mike!

20:55.131 --> 20:56.338
That was cool.

21:01.992 --> 21:04.480
The phone lines are broken,
the hospitals are ransacked,

21:04.600 --> 21:08.230
not to mention the fact they told me
they get robbed by bandits at night.

21:08.621 --> 21:11.400
We should be out in these neighborhoods
at night, when they need us.

21:11.956 --> 21:13.254
That's a no-go.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.604
Battalion says
there's too much heavy fighting

21:15.724 --> 21:18.592
- going on at night for us to patrol.
- Right, that's exactly why...

21:18.712 --> 21:21.558
Battalion thinks what we have to do
is let this work itself out.

21:21.678 --> 21:22.828
Work itself out?

21:26.492 --> 21:30.294
"The ability of hostile forces
in Baghdad to successfully

21:30.454 --> 21:32.913
"and continually engage our forces
will be complicated

21:33.033 --> 21:34.799
"by the local shia's intolerance,

21:35.184 --> 21:39.110
"for regime paramilitary forces
hiding out in their neighborhoods. "

21:41.108 --> 21:44.642
You're saying we're gonna stand down
and let one side kill the other.

21:44.802 --> 21:47.580
Battalion says we don't go out at night.
It's too dangerous.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.516
Godfather says the Shias
will be doing our dirty work for us.

21:50.636 --> 21:53.741
If we go out after dark,
the Shia's might engage us.

21:57.356 --> 21:59.607
Tomorrow night we're billeted
to the north of the city

21:59.727 --> 22:01.033
in a hospital complex.

22:01.498 --> 22:03.965
But Captain, the neighborhood
we were at todayneeds us.

22:04.085 --> 22:05.704
That's not our mission.

22:17.418 --> 22:20.001
<i>Hitman Two actual,
this is Hitman Two One.</i>

22:20.233 --> 22:21.955
<i>We're at the objective.</i>

22:23.294 --> 22:25.659
<i>Roger, dismount up here. Over.</i>

22:26.140 --> 22:27.343
<i>Two One copy.</i>

22:29.446 --> 22:31.448
Let's find out what they need.

23:02.686 --> 23:04.638
They say they require only two items:

23:05.129 --> 23:08.099
fresh water,
and statues of George Bush,

23:08.261 --> 23:10.519
which they plan to erect up
and down the street

23:10.679 --> 23:13.731
as soon as the Americans
help them pump out the sewage.

23:14.557 --> 23:18.545
They think Bush is a ruler like Saddam.
They don't understand the idea

23:18.680 --> 23:21.447
of a president
who maybe next year will go out.

23:26.451 --> 23:28.162
They're drinking shit water.

23:28.572 --> 23:29.383
Damn.

23:32.743 --> 23:34.335
Where is our interpreter from?

23:34.710 --> 23:38.392
He walked up to the factory yesterday,
volunteered his services.

23:40.667 --> 23:44.094
They said the barricades
to help keep people out...

23:45.946 --> 23:47.431
Everyone is armed.

23:50.097 --> 23:53.437
Because the police stations
and the armories have been emptied,

23:53.875 --> 23:57.441
an A.K. now costs the same
as about two packages of cigarettes.

24:03.392 --> 24:05.778
Those from an outlying neighborhood
have set up a mortar

24:05.943 --> 24:08.452
behind the mosque and at night,
they shoot mortars at random.

24:08.612 --> 24:10.287
- They kill us!
- Ali Baba!

24:10.447 --> 24:11.372
Ali Ba!

24:14.460 --> 24:17.390
You've taken the country apart.
You're not putting it back together.

24:17.510 --> 24:19.499
The violence that goes on at night- -

24:19.619 --> 24:21.375
Letting vigilantes and thieves out

24:21.495 --> 24:24.378
will not correct the problems
of Saddam's rule.

24:24.884 --> 24:25.886
All this...

24:26.407 --> 24:27.497
is a bomb.

24:28.458 --> 24:31.410
If it explodes,
it will be bigger than the war.

24:38.847 --> 24:40.150
Two, every other day.

24:41.628 --> 24:42.653
Two, okay?

24:42.773 --> 24:43.815
- Two.
- Yeah.

24:46.997 --> 24:47.866
Stiney?

24:48.289 --> 24:50.690
Rehydration pack and water, all right?

24:51.029 --> 24:52.070
You got it.

24:52.629 --> 24:54.097
Rehydration packs...

24:54.741 --> 24:55.707
and water.

25:06.721 --> 25:10.643
You can smell the cordite in the air
from all the gunfire overnight.

25:10.865 --> 25:13.233
This is supposed to be the Shia
removing the Fedayeen

25:13.353 --> 25:16.529
- and the Sunnis that backed Saddam.
- It's bullshit.

25:16.754 --> 25:20.743
That's what theytell us in the briefings
but this is a 100% Shia neighborhood.

25:22.786 --> 25:25.902
They asked me if it was possible,
could we stay the night.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.177
I had to tell them no, we had orders.

25:30.003 --> 25:33.580
They asked for water.
I told them we'd come back another day.

25:34.277 --> 25:35.562
But guess what.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.328
I just got word
that we're gonna rebillet again,

25:39.793 --> 25:42.382
move from the hospital
to some power plant further east.

25:42.502 --> 25:44.672
Chances are we'll patrol
another neighborhood tomorrow

25:44.833 --> 25:46.884
and then another one the next day.

25:50.064 --> 25:51.221
This is madness.

25:59.462 --> 26:02.009
They say they have headaches,
they cannot sleep.

26:02.129 --> 26:03.495
They want Valium.

26:04.353 --> 26:06.111
Tell them
I'm not gonna give them Valium

26:06.271 --> 26:08.630
or anything else
for cutting in front of the kids.

26:10.715 --> 26:11.729
It's okay.

26:20.151 --> 26:21.662
Bro, give that back!

26:24.216 --> 26:25.370
- Doc?
- Yeah.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.467
I'm handing out candy
to the sick kids outside.

26:29.097 --> 26:31.494
These dudes just come by
and steal it from them.

26:31.614 --> 26:32.997
Grown fucking men!

26:38.197 --> 26:40.395
Okay, get the fuck out of here. Go!

26:54.196 --> 26:55.702
Sir, we're about to be overrun.

26:56.424 --> 26:57.753
I can see that.

26:58.845 --> 27:01.333
All right. We're gonna egress
as soon as possible.

27:05.495 --> 27:07.473
<i>Two One alpha,
this is Two One Bravo...</i>

27:07.593 --> 27:08.757
Outta the way!

27:10.460 --> 27:12.469
- I'm sorry, we've got to go.
- Back it up!

27:12.998 --> 27:16.172
<i>Make sure they don't steal anything
out of our trucks.</i>

27:30.858 --> 27:34.416
You're gonna talk to them alone?
Why aren't you going with Lt Fick?

27:34.536 --> 27:37.774
- The Imam will not talk to soldiers.
- Can I come with you?

27:37.894 --> 27:39.431
Dude, you're a soldier.

27:39.551 --> 27:40.639
No, I'm not.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.971
Where did Mr. Hussein go?

27:44.091 --> 27:46.056
- I mean, wasn't he...
- He disappeared.

27:47.245 --> 27:48.924
He was a Ba'athist agent

27:50.400 --> 27:51.945
sent to spy on you.

27:52.228 --> 27:53.065
What?

28:26.618 --> 28:27.766
Wait here...

28:28.729 --> 28:29.610
Infidel.

29:24.293 --> 29:25.835
So what did he say?

29:26.497 --> 29:29.007
Well, he says he welcomes
the Americans

29:29.381 --> 29:33.298
as long as they don't expose the Iraqi
people to any corrupting influences.

29:33.805 --> 29:37.745
I told him we would bring water down
to distribute from the mosque.

29:38.076 --> 29:41.368
Also I asked him for help with the crowd
so that they don't go crazy.

29:41.924 --> 29:45.414
He says that the Americans
should hit them if they come too close.

29:46.043 --> 29:46.841
What?

29:47.024 --> 29:50.249
He says these people are used
to being pushed around.

29:56.676 --> 29:59.970
All week long, everywhere we go,
people have been asking us for water.

30:01.096 --> 30:03.974
We finally bring it to them
and nobody fucking wants it.

30:04.134 --> 30:07.853
They are broadcasting that it's
against Islam to help the Americans.

30:08.124 --> 30:12.108
Yeah, we invaded their country.
You'd think they'd at least be grateful.

30:15.632 --> 30:18.939
Are you sure the Imam
wanted the Americans to come here?

30:19.302 --> 30:21.696
Dude, the meeting was totally cool.

30:29.109 --> 30:30.584
I don't know what to think.

30:30.878 --> 30:32.222
What does Meesh say?

30:32.342 --> 30:34.503
Not that Meesh is that big
of an asshole or anything,

30:34.664 --> 30:37.215
but how did an elite unit like ours
roll into this shit

30:37.375 --> 30:39.735
with only one guy
who could fucking speak Arabic?

30:39.855 --> 30:41.756
I mean, what the fuck, sir?

30:48.907 --> 30:51.457
<i>Roger, Hitman actual.
Solid copy on frag.</i>

30:51.577 --> 30:52.878
<i>Hitman Two out.</i>

31:00.749 --> 31:02.501
This is a park right here

31:02.621 --> 31:06.201
that's supposed to be used
as a staging area for the Fedayeen.

31:06.321 --> 31:07.613
From our position,

31:07.901 --> 31:11.124
we're gonna be able to use night optics
and set up an OP on the park.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.862
And come morning,

31:12.982 --> 31:15.879
we move in and sweep it
for signs of hostile forces.

31:19.393 --> 31:20.300
Gentlemen,

31:21.013 --> 31:24.513
- they finally gave us a night recon.
- You're really desperate, Brad.

31:35.481 --> 31:36.566
It's bizarre.

31:38.206 --> 31:41.071
All of them driving
in and out of the city like it's normal.

31:42.679 --> 31:45.239
<i>- Yeah.
- Hitman actual to Hitman Two.</i>

31:45.641 --> 31:47.004
Hitman Two actual.

31:48.218 --> 31:51.494
<i>Godfather is saying it's time for us
to be more aggressive.</i>

31:51.683 --> 31:54.436
<i>Suggest you send foot patrols out
into the neighborhoods below.</i>

31:54.556 --> 31:56.378
<i>- How copy?
- More aggressive?</i>

31:56.996 --> 32:00.420
<i>Godfather says it's time for us
to increase our presence.</i>

32:02.024 --> 32:04.719
Sir, given the level of disorder
in the city at this time,

32:05.145 --> 32:07.055
and given our lack
of a cohesive mission,

32:07.469 --> 32:10.408
I'm gonna have my men remain
in a defensive position until dawn,

32:10.528 --> 32:13.395
<i>- when we'll move on the park.
- Negative. Godfather...</i>

32:13.555 --> 32:16.565
Hitman, having assessed the situation
from close observation,

32:17.076 --> 32:20.834
I'm gonna keep my men in a
defensive posture until dawn. How copy?

32:20.954 --> 32:22.863
<i>Hitman Two, I say again...</i>

32:27.626 --> 32:29.670
They want me to be more aggressive.

32:29.833 --> 32:31.340
Send the men into this.

32:31.709 --> 32:32.709
For what?

32:33.900 --> 32:36.376
So I can come home
with 21 men instead of 22?

32:37.869 --> 32:38.869
For what?

32:42.751 --> 32:44.456
I trust your judgment, sir.

32:52.339 --> 32:53.508
I can be wrong.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.023
A platoon commander's situational
awareness doesn't extend very far.

32:58.183 --> 32:59.191
Far enough, sir.

33:04.751 --> 33:07.289
I'm talking about a lack of obedience
to orders.

33:07.409 --> 33:08.617
Your job, Nate,

33:08.796 --> 33:12.270
is to execute whatever your Captain
tells you to execute, and you don't.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.207
Given that you were not actually present
to assess the situation,

33:15.367 --> 33:17.117
I used my discretion
as the C.O. of the...

33:17.237 --> 33:19.289
You've been questioning my orders
ever since Ar Rifa.

33:19.409 --> 33:22.589
No, I have executed your orders on every
occasion except those few in which

33:22.749 --> 33:24.925
- to do so would have needlessly...
- You believe this?

33:25.169 --> 33:27.677
The Corps won't forget.
It never does, Lieutenant.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.025
Dismissed.

33:56.151 --> 33:57.666
Get me the det kit.

33:59.292 --> 34:00.126
Dawg,

34:01.204 --> 34:02.446
this is not cool.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.923
Just go and get it from the truck, Poke.

34:07.839 --> 34:09.886
Exactly what do you know
about ordnance removal?

34:10.045 --> 34:11.163
Jack and shit.

34:12.054 --> 34:13.681
Kids play in this garden.

34:18.210 --> 34:19.670
This is some bullshit.

34:25.643 --> 34:26.560
Garden?

34:26.848 --> 34:27.848
What garden?

34:27.967 --> 34:29.828
A garden's supposed
to have plants in it.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.195
This is bullshit.

34:41.802 --> 34:44.379
- What's the Sergeant doing?
- Trying to blow hisself up.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.917
Probably gonna blow us all up.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.913
Hey guys. You remember those old movies
where they hit the bomb...

34:51.033 --> 34:51.886
Thanks.

34:52.112 --> 34:54.024
- No problem, Brad.
- ... and the main guy

34:54.143 --> 34:56.141
has to cut either the red wire
or the black wire

34:56.261 --> 34:58.226
and he's sweating his balls off?

35:00.326 --> 35:01.521
This is kinda like that.

35:02.081 --> 35:04.441
- Who thought we'd be doing this shit...
- Shut up, Ray.

35:07.817 --> 35:09.067
It's time, gents.

35:13.401 --> 35:14.216
God!

35:14.336 --> 35:15.345
Hell yeah!

35:16.474 --> 35:18.273
I love it when bombs go off!

35:18.393 --> 35:19.688
Love that shit!

35:20.158 --> 35:21.694
Blowed up real good.

35:25.243 --> 35:26.907
Don't you feel better now?

35:27.860 --> 35:29.206
Like this solves anything.

35:29.326 --> 35:32.449
Well, there's one less bomb
in the garden now, isn't there?

35:32.721 --> 35:34.812
Dawg, did you hear on the BBC today?

35:35.118 --> 35:36.854
Some newly arrived grunts

35:37.114 --> 35:40.267
slaughtered some Iraqi kids
who were playing on blown tanks.

35:40.387 --> 35:41.427
You serious?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.623
It's true, man. It happened.

35:44.299 --> 35:46.066
They were playing on top of the tanks,

35:46.226 --> 35:48.818
so the R.O.E. said
they were technically armed.

35:49.368 --> 35:51.164
General Mattis, he's on the radio saying

35:51.284 --> 35:53.759
this was the worst thing
in the war so far.

35:54.601 --> 35:56.210
They're screwing this up.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.446
Fucking idiots.

36:00.601 --> 36:03.249
Don't they fucking realize the world
already hates us?

36:04.178 --> 36:05.269
Another one!

36:06.452 --> 36:07.256
Fuck.

36:07.831 --> 36:10.174
He says it's in a hole
next to his house.

36:11.223 --> 36:13.277
- All right, let's go.
- Hey, dawg.

36:13.614 --> 36:14.552
Hey, dawg!

36:15.303 --> 36:18.634
You know when I was gonna write a book
about my life as a repo man in L.A.?

36:18.754 --> 36:20.295
You know what I was gonna call it?

36:20.415 --> 36:21.994
"Nobody gives a fuck. "

36:22.392 --> 36:23.461
That's right.

36:23.687 --> 36:24.760
Nobody does.

36:25.464 --> 36:27.444
You know the ideal place and time

36:27.694 --> 36:28.842
to repo a car?

36:29.594 --> 36:31.319
Crowded parking a lot, mid-afternoon.

36:31.728 --> 36:35.342
You can jump in the car, drive that
bitch off with the car alarm blaring.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.023
Nobody's gonna stop you.

36:37.205 --> 36:39.106
Nobody's even gonna look at you.

36:39.287 --> 36:40.287
Know why?

36:40.771 --> 36:42.038
Nobody gives a fuck.

36:43.538 --> 36:45.083
In my line of work,

36:45.541 --> 36:47.576
- that was key to everything.
- We kill civilians,

36:47.696 --> 36:49.920
we're gonna waste this fucking victory.

36:51.096 --> 36:53.717
- We can't keep doing this.
- Relax, Iceman, relax.

36:54.461 --> 36:57.345
The only thing we gotta worry about here
are fucking do-gooders.

36:58.402 --> 36:59.402
Luckily

36:59.656 --> 37:02.267
- there's not too many of those.
- Get out of there, Brad.

37:02.427 --> 37:04.678
- Sir, we've another Mark-82...
- That's an order.

37:04.798 --> 37:07.394
- Sir, I strongly request...
- I will not let you blow yourself up

37:07.514 --> 37:09.605
trying to maintain property values
in Baghdad.

37:09.767 --> 37:10.942
That's a no-go.

37:13.441 --> 37:14.988
Up and out, Sergeant.

37:17.206 --> 37:18.677
Get out of the hole.

37:23.691 --> 37:25.153
We're done here, Brad.

37:41.248 --> 37:43.266
Yes, but the secret to great porn

37:43.555 --> 37:46.428
is that you never want to see the guys,
not their faces.

37:46.548 --> 37:49.517
What if he eats her out?
How can you not see his face?

37:51.810 --> 37:53.234
It definitely looks like gin.

37:54.004 --> 37:56.734
- It's clear.
- The man's asking $5 a fifth.

37:58.119 --> 37:59.904
- More than reasonable?
- What kind is it?

38:00.068 --> 38:03.850
That doesn't come out when there are
officers or senior N.C.Os present.

38:04.570 --> 38:05.691
Aye, aye, sir.

38:06.426 --> 38:08.748
Yo, what's this they got us
racked out in?

38:08.868 --> 38:10.334
It's a soccer stadium.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.985
It's where Saddam's kid
had his soccer team.

38:13.105 --> 38:15.089
He'd torture them if they'd lose.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.112
They must have been pretty good.

38:19.476 --> 38:20.487
Well, boys,

38:21.371 --> 38:23.144
to our last night in Baghdad.

38:26.418 --> 38:29.115
Lt. 's just got to hand in his write-up
so Ferrando

38:29.235 --> 38:32.496
can get all the medals and streamers
lined up for battalion.

38:32.616 --> 38:35.172
And I heard Eckhoff saying
that we're moving to a base

38:35.292 --> 38:37.220
just south of the city tomorrow.

38:37.739 --> 38:39.075
So that's it, brah.

38:39.332 --> 38:40.332
We're out.

38:44.653 --> 38:45.453
Shit!

38:46.315 --> 38:48.453
Back home on the news I'll bet you
they're talking about

38:48.573 --> 38:50.442
what heroes we all are now.

38:50.782 --> 38:52.891
Reality is we're the kids other parents
told their kids

38:53.011 --> 38:54.879
not to hang with in high school.

38:55.219 --> 38:57.241
Rudy, put your damn shirt on.

38:57.361 --> 38:58.925
You know what I'd like to see?

38:59.343 --> 39:02.846
A couple of them college kids
from an MTV beach party drop into Iraq.

39:03.231 --> 39:05.695
They could see what being a hero
is really like.

39:05.815 --> 39:08.124
The first time they'd see
what it was like not to have control

39:08.244 --> 39:09.727
over their fucking lives.

39:11.526 --> 39:13.398
On second thought, scratch that.

39:13.612 --> 39:16.484
Middle-class college kids out here
will get us all killed.

39:18.006 --> 39:19.618
Yo, what I'd like to see?

39:19.944 --> 39:22.532
Shit, I've seen 203 rounds
go into windows

39:22.735 --> 39:24.483
and through a door one time.

39:24.686 --> 39:26.372
But what I wish I had seen?

39:27.551 --> 39:30.106
A grenade go up in someone's body
and just...

39:30.787 --> 39:31.587
Boom.

39:32.228 --> 39:33.566
Blow that shit up.

39:34.564 --> 39:36.623
- Crazy motherfucker.
- I mean it.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.135
- That motherfucker's gun is caught?
- Pull, motherfucker, pull!

39:40.255 --> 39:41.259
Pull it!

39:42.159 --> 39:43.495
Look at this fuck.

39:44.609 --> 39:47.508
God damn,
that motherfucker's Mr. Magoo up there.

39:47.628 --> 39:49.009
That was slapstick.

39:49.674 --> 39:51.949
- Look at that fool!
- Shit, what up, brother?

39:52.069 --> 39:55.231
- Yeah, you do your thing!
- Haji ought to hit him with a pie!

39:57.105 --> 39:58.359
Dawg, you catch that?

39:58.519 --> 40:00.570
Yeah, that one's in my movie
for sure, bro.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.523
- Nice.
- The shit is magic.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.161
You know the military can fuck up
anything.

40:06.861 --> 40:09.162
They can even make going
to the beach suck.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.326
But one thing that ain't overrated

40:11.446 --> 40:12.498
is combat.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.877
You take rounds, you shoot back,
shit starts blowing up...

40:16.757 --> 40:18.425
Fucking sensory overload.

40:25.784 --> 40:26.913
That was cool.

40:27.275 --> 40:28.836
Who do we invade now?

40:30.543 --> 40:31.992
This isn't over, Ray.

40:33.315 --> 40:35.487
We don't even know what we've started.

40:40.334 --> 40:42.971
We may be here all summer long.

40:46.117 --> 40:46.967
21 days.

40:47.838 --> 40:50.042
21 days to take down an entire country.

40:51.270 --> 40:53.720
You gotta give the white man his props.

41:38.010 --> 41:40.260
What's that? You writing her back?

41:40.882 --> 41:41.682
Yeah.

41:43.786 --> 41:45.919
My wife, man, she's smart, but...

41:46.513 --> 41:48.563
she fucked up when she married me.

41:49.216 --> 41:50.766
I was a piece of shit.

41:52.072 --> 41:54.098
I remember the first time I met her,

41:54.218 --> 41:56.474
she told me about
all the books that she had read.

41:56.716 --> 41:58.010
Dawg, it hit me.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.326
There's a whole world that I missed.

42:01.487 --> 42:03.525
Before I met her, I used to think:

42:03.658 --> 42:05.539
"I got a shit load of hand skills,

42:06.485 --> 42:07.447
"welding,

42:08.010 --> 42:08.917
"pipefitting,

42:09.077 --> 42:10.323
"repoing cars.

42:11.314 --> 42:13.175
"Any pussy can read a book. "

42:15.189 --> 42:16.439
See, I didn't...

42:16.559 --> 42:18.514
I didn't grow up?with no understanding.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.121
My mom tried, but...

42:20.834 --> 42:22.620
but my dad, he was this...

42:24.055 --> 42:26.392
he was a psycho ex-Marine Vietnam vet.

42:26.512 --> 42:27.936
What do you mean psycho?

42:28.427 --> 42:29.563
He won a bronze star.

42:30.766 --> 42:32.441
Shit, I wish I had his warrior skills.

42:32.912 --> 42:33.650
But...

42:34.912 --> 42:35.981
he left us.

42:37.777 --> 42:38.800
Left after

42:39.173 --> 42:42.076
his fucking jealous bitch
of a girlfriend shot his ass

42:42.785 --> 42:44.208
in my mom's house.

42:45.132 --> 42:48.465
One day my old man,
he tries to patch things up with me.

42:48.585 --> 42:50.435
He's gonna take me fishing.

42:50.953 --> 42:52.903
Except on the way to the lake,

42:54.109 --> 42:56.048
he takes us to this porn shop

42:56.952 --> 42:59.051
so he can have a jack in the booths.

42:59.729 --> 43:02.037
Leaves me outside in the parking lot

43:02.157 --> 43:03.307
where this...

43:04.101 --> 43:06.101
old fruit tries to cruise me.

43:07.774 --> 43:10.104
I threw a fucking brick
through that fool's windshield.

43:11.761 --> 43:13.645
That was our father-son trip.

43:18.540 --> 43:19.491
Dawg,

43:20.130 --> 43:21.360
listen to this.

43:23.311 --> 43:26.475
"I've learned
there's two types of people in Iraq:

43:26.595 --> 43:28.381
"those who are very good,

43:28.910 --> 43:30.600
"and those who are dead.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.376
"I'm very good.

43:33.848 --> 43:36.947
"I've lost 20 Ibs, shaved my head,

43:37.942 --> 43:39.353
"started smoking,

43:39.716 --> 43:41.515
"my feet have half rotted off

43:42.197 --> 43:45.609
"and I move from filthy hole
to filthy hole every night.

43:46.977 --> 43:47.811
"I see

43:48.278 --> 43:50.479
"dead children and people everywhere,

43:51.016 --> 43:53.310
"and function in a void of indifference.

43:55.531 --> 43:58.478
"I keep you and our daughter
locked away deep inside,

43:59.765 --> 44:01.715
"and I try not to look there. "

44:06.711 --> 44:08.893
Dawg, you think that's too harsh?

44:10.940 --> 44:12.641
Tony, you know, you think

44:12.761 --> 44:14.953
way too much.

44:17.581 --> 44:19.341
Sir, battalion's on the net.

44:29.009 --> 44:31.434
Assassin Actual, standing by to copy.

44:41.389 --> 44:42.429

44:42.549 --> 44:43.578
Roger that.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.988
Now you copy this, Major.

44:46.108 --> 44:49.744
My men are not carrying out
that mission. This is a no-go.

44:49.864 --> 44:53.707
<i>I say again, Godfather requires
an escort for two engineers</i>

44:57.848 --> 45:00.893
They wanted us to help engineers
mark a minefield with chem-lights.

45:01.013 --> 45:02.463
- At night?
- Yeah.

45:02.745 --> 45:04.695
It's against division orders.

45:05.366 --> 45:06.641
Fucking idiots.

45:08.090 --> 45:10.340
<i>Hitman Three, this is Hitman Actual.</i>

45:24.324 --> 45:25.619
<i>How copy? Over.</i>

45:26.072 --> 45:28.122
Yes, sir. Hitman Three is on it.

45:30.691 --> 45:31.941
Where's Kocher?

45:32.327 --> 45:34.320
We're back in business tonight.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.490
Battalion has a minefield
that needs to be marked.

45:37.616 --> 45:38.566
At night?

45:43.055 --> 45:47.006
Aren't you the guys that were suspended
for trying to bayonet a prisoner?

45:49.063 --> 45:49.857
Yep.

45:50.503 --> 45:52.153
What happened with that?

45:53.124 --> 45:56.394
We weren't trying to bayonet a prisoner.
We were exonerated.

45:56.968 --> 45:58.855
The Captain was trying
to bayonet the prisoner.

45:59.636 --> 46:01.886
I hear he's getting a medal for it.

46:04.079 --> 46:08.069
Same goofus who's got us all out here
at night trying to mark a minefield.

46:16.101 --> 46:18.625
I thought they were just supposed
to stand in the road

46:18.785 --> 46:20.905
and toss chem-lights into the field.

46:23.964 --> 46:26.670
What are they doing
way the fuck out there?

46:27.643 --> 46:29.144
Hitman, this is Hitman Three.

46:29.264 --> 46:31.314
We are proceeding accordingly...

46:35.110 --> 46:37.185
Dirty, get the corpsman! Man down!

46:37.535 --> 46:38.811
Get the corpsman!

46:41.171 --> 46:43.439
- Hitman, this is Hitman Three...
- Get up, bro, easy easy.

46:43.559 --> 46:45.463
...a landmine detonate
on the engineers!

46:45.583 --> 46:47.882
Possible man down!
I say again, we have a po...

46:48.002 --> 46:49.573
Correction, we have two men down!

46:49.733 --> 46:52.368
Here, come down on your knees.
There you go.

46:52.488 --> 46:55.494
- I think it's my eye. How does it look?
- All right.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.133
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

47:00.602 --> 47:03.044
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna give you some gauze,

47:03.164 --> 47:04.814
add some pressure to it.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.205
Here you go.

47:16.105 --> 47:17.955
Okay, I'll get you on three.

47:18.325 --> 47:19.575
One, two, three.

47:21.087 --> 47:23.103
Eric? Eric?

47:23.578 --> 47:25.328
Don't step on a landmine.

47:27.646 --> 47:28.967
Gunny, no drama.

47:29.370 --> 47:31.420
We'll have you back in no time.

47:31.935 --> 47:34.474
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, it hurts.
- Give him morphine.

47:34.594 --> 47:36.578
No, can't give him morphine
till he's stabilized.

47:39.993 --> 47:42.587
Turn off here. I know a shortcut.
It's on the mapsheet.

47:42.707 --> 47:44.984
- Sir, let's take the road we know.
- No, Sergeant!

47:45.104 --> 47:46.654
It's a goddamn order.

47:47.282 --> 47:48.507
I know this shortcut.

48:04.287 --> 48:05.125
Stop!

48:05.802 --> 48:07.293
We need to unload it.

48:07.498 --> 48:08.956
Carisalez, Redman!

48:10.165 --> 48:11.825
Get him to the back of Moreno's vehicle.

48:11.945 --> 48:12.795
Out, out.

48:13.163 --> 48:14.313
I got the leg.

48:14.584 --> 48:15.634
Keep going.

48:15.923 --> 48:17.473
Good. Good, good, good.

48:24.911 --> 48:26.173
It's all right.

48:28.495 --> 48:29.640
This sucks.

48:30.150 --> 48:31.900
We need this inventoried.

48:32.610 --> 48:35.273
Down to the last bullet
before we ship out.

48:39.636 --> 48:41.186
What the fuck is that?

48:41.699 --> 48:44.657
They got wild dogs roaming around
the camp by the shitters.

48:44.777 --> 48:46.415
They use shotguns on them.

48:47.215 --> 48:48.565
You see, Sergeant?

48:48.934 --> 48:50.684
We do shoot dogs in Iraq.

49:05.288 --> 49:07.149
Ratfucked a blown haji tank.

49:07.699 --> 49:09.655
I can't believe I'm getting paid
to dip, work out

49:09.775 --> 49:12.507
and hang out with
the best guys in the world.

49:15.248 --> 49:17.198
- Let's go.
- Fuck it, dude.

49:17.950 --> 49:18.700
Brad,

49:19.466 --> 49:22.601
you need to fill these D.D.40s
in triplicate for the shipping pallets.

49:23.389 --> 49:24.259
Yes, sir.

49:24.379 --> 49:27.147
- Any word on those mine casualties?
- Cas-evac'd at dawn.

49:27.411 --> 49:29.900
One lost an eye,
the other a leg beneath the knee.

49:30.599 --> 49:34.581
Any word on why Encino Man sent them out
on orders that Alpha company refused?

49:38.514 --> 49:40.664
This war has an official name now:

49:41.306 --> 49:42.956
Operation Iraqi Freedom.

49:47.364 --> 49:48.435
Hoo-rah, sir.

49:48.876 --> 49:50.057
Hoo-rah.

49:53.204 --> 49:55.254
I don't miss anything from home.

49:57.914 --> 49:59.864
The only exception is my bike.

50:00.691 --> 50:01.741
I miss that.

50:03.795 --> 50:06.173
Speed, solitude and no one can touch me.

50:11.574 --> 50:13.328
Where the fuck did you go?

50:14.063 --> 50:16.613
You haven't said two words
since Baghdad.

50:17.835 --> 50:19.285
No more ripped fuel.

50:22.452 --> 50:23.224
Man...

50:25.395 --> 50:27.914
It seems no matter where
we go as marines,

50:28.034 --> 50:30.184
it's always some fucking shithole.

50:43.488 --> 50:44.311
Well,

50:45.050 --> 50:46.300
I'll see y'all.

50:57.677 --> 50:58.527
Thanks.

51:01.531 --> 51:02.581
Stay frosty.

51:09.722 --> 51:12.543
We're gonna play some guys from Alpha.
You guys up for that?

51:16.498 --> 51:17.674
Hoo-rah, motherfuckers.

51:18.821 --> 51:20.092
Fuck it, I'll play.

51:22.178 --> 51:23.346
Back among the living?

51:36.394 --> 51:37.244
Colonel.

51:49.213 --> 51:50.582
So what'd you see, reporter?

51:55.327 --> 51:58.209
No other military in the world
can do what we do.

51:58.636 --> 52:00.508
The Marines are America's shock troops.

52:02.023 --> 52:05.388
Is there anything you want to ask me
before you unhitch your wagon?

52:06.143 --> 52:07.497
Captain Americ...

52:07.784 --> 52:09.058
Captain McGraw, Sir.

52:11.146 --> 52:12.296
All right now,

52:13.192 --> 52:15.123
he walked a fine line.

52:16.486 --> 52:17.317
Okay?

52:17.706 --> 52:20.849
But in the end, he was within the box

52:21.378 --> 52:23.028
of acceptable behavior.

52:23.355 --> 52:24.866
But in my mind,

52:25.027 --> 52:28.745
when you allow that behavior
to progress, you end up with a My Lai.

52:30.688 --> 52:32.624
You think I should
have taken harsher action.

52:33.455 --> 52:34.959
Two attempted bayonetings.

52:35.139 --> 52:37.879
But no Iraqi prisoners actually wounded.

52:39.016 --> 52:41.383
All right, now I wasn't there
to see what happened

52:41.732 --> 52:44.537
and I have conflicting reports
from those who were.

52:45.422 --> 52:48.181
But we're in a war zone, reporter.

52:49.057 --> 52:51.929
And if I expect my subordinates
to remain

52:52.200 --> 52:55.846
effective in combat,
then I have to show them trust...

52:56.516 --> 53:00.151
Until it's proven to me beyond any doubt

53:00.826 --> 53:02.820
that they are undeserving of that trust.

53:02.981 --> 53:03.899
Now

53:04.019 --> 53:07.386
the same support I extend
to Captain McGraw

53:08.282 --> 53:10.326
is extended to all my officers.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.392
Lieutenant Fick, for example.

53:13.512 --> 53:16.777
I'm sure you're aware
there's some in this battalion

53:17.351 --> 53:18.753
who feel that Lieutenant Fick

53:18.914 --> 53:20.464
is unfit for command.

53:23.756 --> 53:26.162
You should consider your sources, sir.

53:28.297 --> 53:30.348
So what happens to my command

53:30.978 --> 53:31.891
if I respond

53:32.827 --> 53:35.937
to every complaint made
against one of my men?

53:40.318 --> 53:41.988
It's a terrible feeling

53:43.176 --> 53:44.409
to be the man

53:44.860 --> 53:46.364
sending other people

53:46.605 --> 53:47.708
into combat.

53:49.325 --> 53:50.702
Terrible feeling.

54:01.998 --> 54:03.965
But something else
I'm struggling with...

54:05.628 --> 54:07.576
is the excitement I felt...

54:10.839 --> 54:12.328
in getting shot at.

54:14.720 --> 54:17.816
It's just something
I hadn't anticipated about war.

54:18.658 --> 54:19.590
Did you?

54:37.368 --> 54:38.223
Break!

54:40.027 --> 54:41.584
Let's go! We got 'em.

54:41.704 --> 54:43.400
No problem, no problem.

54:44.333 --> 54:47.007
Hut one, hut two.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

54:49.251 --> 54:50.611
Help him. Get up.

54:50.731 --> 54:52.597
- Go, baby, go.
- Fuck yeah!

54:55.343 --> 54:56.682
Outstanding, baby!

54:57.644 --> 54:59.437
Alpha ain't got nothing on us.
Let's go.

54:59.597 --> 55:00.547
Huddle up.

55:01.599 --> 55:03.249
Next down. Come on now.

55:04.428 --> 55:06.118
That'd be some buckeye football!

55:06.238 --> 55:07.152
Hell yeah!

55:07.313 --> 55:08.063
Ready?

55:08.279 --> 55:10.029
Let's go, guys. Come on.

55:13.705 --> 55:15.411
Come on, motherfuckers.

55:15.868 --> 55:17.080
Ready, set, hut!

55:17.240 --> 55:20.238
- We own these motherfuckers.
- Way to go, baby.

55:37.996 --> 55:39.515
Alpha's too slow!

55:47.287 --> 55:49.779
Let's go, Bravo. Come on!

55:51.458 --> 55:52.866
Come on brother, bring it.

55:54.319 --> 55:55.743
My sister needs her shorts back

56:02.361 --> 56:04.585
- Here we go, baby.
- I own these motherfuckers.

56:04.833 --> 56:05.879
I own 'em, baby!

56:06.152 --> 56:06.902
Yeah.

56:13.943 --> 56:14.721
Captain!

56:15.733 --> 56:17.931
- Fucking kill you, man.
- It's a game, sir.

56:18.092 --> 56:19.183
It got out of hand.

56:19.344 --> 56:20.394
Relax relax.

56:21.624 --> 56:22.919
What was that about?

56:23.039 --> 56:24.280
Fucking asshole.

56:24.716 --> 56:25.666
I'm fine.

57:31.291 --> 57:32.368
Motherfucker.

57:38.274 --> 57:39.846
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

57:39.966 --> 57:41.666
Let him go! Let him go!

57:48.951 --> 57:50.057
Rudy, Rudy!

57:50.764 --> 57:52.291
Come on, Rudy, get off.

57:52.411 --> 57:54.181
- Motherfucker!
- Stay there.

57:54.301 --> 57:56.451
You goddamn fucking piece of shit!

57:57.024 --> 57:59.158
You fucking P.T.S.D. Psycho.

57:59.899 --> 58:03.047
You're just like every other
jock piece of shit in high school.

58:03.167 --> 58:04.751
Get the fuck off of me.

58:08.423 --> 58:10.973
Maybe we shouldn't
play football anymore.

58:14.134 --> 58:14.931
Ray!

58:15.639 --> 58:16.508
Brother!

58:19.238 --> 58:21.055
- You all right?
- God damn it, Rudy.

58:21.175 --> 58:24.514
Go to your little quiet place
and chant, motherfucker.

58:49.216 --> 58:51.627
Y'all gets a free pass
on the hooch tonight.

58:52.752 --> 58:53.895
But tomorry,

58:54.444 --> 58:56.494
y'all tighten up your assholes.

58:57.148 --> 58:58.198
Roger that.

59:00.180 --> 59:03.180
We have to believe things are better now
than they were under Saddam.

59:03.738 --> 59:06.975
This place was fucked before
we got here and it's fucked now.

59:08.543 --> 59:10.438
I don't believe we liberated the Iraqis.

59:13.728 --> 59:15.174
Only time will tell.

59:15.712 --> 59:19.058
I just wish I could go back
to that roadblock in Al Hayy.

59:19.178 --> 59:21.948
See if those guys I shot in that truck
were enemy or just confused.

59:23.224 --> 59:24.827
Could have been a truckload of babies,

59:25.272 --> 59:28.445
with the rules of engagement
you did the right thing.

59:28.822 --> 59:32.501
The priest told me it's not a sin
to kill if you don't enjoy killing.

59:33.007 --> 59:34.170
My question is...

59:34.772 --> 59:36.422
whether indifference...

59:36.885 --> 59:38.548
is the same as enjoyment.

59:38.893 --> 59:41.106
All religious stuff aside,

59:42.110 --> 59:46.019
the fact is people who can't kill will
always be subject to those who can.

59:49.670 --> 59:50.977
Yo, check it, check it!

59:51.738 --> 59:53.488
The shiznit, my brothers.

59:54.106 --> 59:55.856
Two One Bravo productions.

59:56.229 --> 59:57.229
Come on up.

59:58.108 --> 59:59.558
Fuck yeah, brothers.

59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.271
Do your thing.

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.577
Two One Bravo's cholo video.
Let me see your wife's titties.

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.997
Yo, doc, you want to come
check out Lilley's movie?

01:00:12.757 --> 01:00:14.532
You're all gonna jerk off.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:15.983
You guys ready?

01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:17.505
- Let's do it.
- Bring it.

01:00:17.852 --> 01:00:21.759
<i>And I heard,
as it were, the noise of thunder.</i>

01:00:22.483 --> 01:00:25.777
<i>One of the four beasts saying,
"Come and see,"</i>

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:29.499
<i>and I saw. And behold a white horse.</i>

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:31.800
<i>- Mayday, baby.
- War is nothing.</i>

01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:34.272
<i>What's up?</i>

01:00:35.473 --> 01:00:37.553
<i>Scuba recon rangers!</i>

01:00:37.673 --> 01:00:39.625
<i>First recon battalion!</i>

01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:28.242
<i>And I heard a voice
in the midst of the four beasts.</i>

01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:30.987
<i>And I looked and behold, a pale horse.</i>

01:04:31.107 --> 01:04:33.677
<i>And his name that set on him was death.</i>

01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:36.582
<i>And hell followed with him.</i>
