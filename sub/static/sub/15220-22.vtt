00:27.598 --> 00:30.935
Dr Sam Beckett stepped into the
Quantum Leap accelerator

00:30.935 --> 00:32.978
and vanished.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.236
He woke to find himself trapped in
the past,

00:40.236 --> 00:43.572
facing mirror images that were not
his own,

00:43.572 --> 00:48.202
and driven by an unknown force to
change history for the better.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.413
His only guide on this journey is Al,

00:51.413 --> 00:53.749
an observer from his own time,

00:53.749 --> 00:58.420
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.633
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:02.633 --> 01:05.594
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:05.594 --> 01:10.850
and hoping each time that his next
leap will be the leap home.'

01:11.934 --> 01:13.978
(THUNDER)

01:16.605 --> 01:18.649
Hey, what's going on here?

01:19.817 --> 01:23.445
Nobody punches me and gets away with
it, nobody!

01:26.407 --> 01:28.075
Butch?

01:28.075 --> 01:30.244
What are you doing?

01:30.244 --> 01:32.413
Dr Masters wanted me to calm him
down.

01:32.413 --> 01:34.582
So I'm gonna calm him down.

01:34.582 --> 01:37.585
You're not giving him shock
treatment?

01:37.585 --> 01:40.045
Shock?
You watch me.

01:40.045 --> 01:42.631
Oh, no!
You know the rules.

01:42.631 --> 01:44.967
Only a doctor's allowed to
administer shock.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.761
A doctor told me to do it and that's
close enough.

01:47.761 --> 01:50.556
Just wait a second.
I wanna get Dr Masters, OK?

01:50.556 --> 01:52.725
No, Butch, please, no!

01:52.725 --> 01:55.436
No, you can't do that. That's too
high. You'll kill him!

01:55.436 --> 01:57.479
(MUFFLED) Oh, no!

03:15.265 --> 03:19.478
♪ Butcher and a baker, candlestick
maker

03:19.478 --> 03:23.982
♪ Butcher, baker, candlestick maker

03:23.982 --> 03:26.026
You're the butcher.

03:26.026 --> 03:29.863
I know you're the butcher.

03:29.863 --> 03:31.907
(WHISTLES)

03:45.879 --> 03:48.257
Mr Biederman's back!

03:48.257 --> 03:50.425
He's feeling much better now.

03:50.425 --> 03:53.053
The more you lunatics
take a swing at me,

03:53.053 --> 03:56.139
you'd better believe I'll make sure
you feel much better, too.

03:56.139 --> 03:59.017
Man, he's been in recovery for four
hours.

03:59.017 --> 04:01.144
Dr Masters must have zapped him a
good one.

04:02.104 --> 04:04.439
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

04:06.817 --> 04:08.902
Did you kill him?
Not today.

04:08.902 --> 04:10.946
You tried to, though, didn't you?

04:14.366 --> 04:17.327
Go finish your puzzle, Tibby.
Didn't you? Didn't you?

04:17.327 --> 04:19.495
If I'd tried, I would have done it.

04:19.495 --> 04:22.916
I mean it, go play with your puzzle
or you won't get ice-cream tonight.

04:22.916 --> 04:25.544
I mean it.
You don't like him?

04:25.544 --> 04:27.504
That's why you keep hurting him.

04:27.504 --> 04:29.756
I keep hurting him cos I don't like
you, Tibby.

04:31.174 --> 04:34.636
So, if he dies, it's gonna be all
your fault.

04:34.636 --> 04:36.555
(THUNDER)

04:36.555 --> 04:38.599
(LAUGHS)

04:43.437 --> 04:45.564
That ain't Mr Biederman.

04:45.564 --> 04:47.357
It ain't! It ain't!

04:47.357 --> 04:49.318
Yeah? Who is it, Tibby?

04:49.318 --> 04:51.361
I don't know,
but it ain't Mr Biederman.

04:51.361 --> 04:53.572
Well, maybe Biederman's dead

04:53.572 --> 04:56.450
and I brought back a stranger
in his place.

04:56.450 --> 04:59.494
No, he ain't dead,
but that ain't him.

04:59.494 --> 05:02.247
When you figure it out,
you come tell me.

05:03.373 --> 05:06.376
I won't tell you nothing. Nothing,
nothing, nothing.

05:06.376 --> 05:09.463
You'd better not make me mad, Tibby.

05:09.463 --> 05:11.882
You don't like it when I get mad.

05:11.882 --> 05:13.175
Boo!

05:14.009 --> 05:16.053
(LAUGHS)

05:32.402 --> 05:35.530
You shouldn't have come here, man.
These folks are crazy.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.699
They won't help you, you know.

05:37.699 --> 05:40.952
They're just looking for a chance to
make you die. They are...

05:42.079 --> 05:44.831
No, we're not, Tibby.
The Butcher's trying to kill him.

05:44.831 --> 05:47.167
Go to your spot, Tibby.
Go right now.

05:51.963 --> 05:54.091
It is kinda weird, don't you think?

05:54.091 --> 05:56.218
Weird?

05:56.218 --> 05:58.845
What's happened with Mr Biederman
since he got here.

05:58.845 --> 06:00.764
He was down at first, then
suddenly...

06:00.764 --> 06:03.683
What happened to Mr Biederman happens
to lots of people.

06:03.683 --> 06:06.645
Yeah. They get committed and then go
crazy.

06:09.481 --> 06:13.443
Personally, I think he'd be better
off if he just went home.

06:13.443 --> 06:15.445
You get my vote on that one.

06:15.445 --> 06:18.698
It's good for Mr Biederman that
you're not a doctor yet, Freddie.

06:18.698 --> 06:21.618
Yeah, well, I hope he isn't stuck
here till I get to be one.

06:21.618 --> 06:24.871
I've been a nurse here for ten
years, Freddie.

06:24.871 --> 06:26.915
I've seen all kinds.

06:26.915 --> 06:29.793
Sam Biederman is a classic
depressive.

06:29.793 --> 06:32.629
He's in here now because he needs
our help.

06:32.629 --> 06:35.006
Sam, you get to use your own name
this time.

06:35.006 --> 06:36.883
That's why he's here with us.

06:39.553 --> 06:43.682
I thought the guy in the waiting room
looked bad. Sam, you look terrible.

06:43.682 --> 06:45.976
Hey, how are you feeling?

06:47.435 --> 06:48.687
Er...

06:50.814 --> 06:53.024
I f-f-feel...

06:53.024 --> 06:57.195
He's had kind of a rough time,
Freddie. He might not recognise you
right away.

06:57.195 --> 07:00.657
Of course he wouldn't recognise him.
He's never seen him before.

07:00.657 --> 07:02.993
Sam, you're Sam Biederman.

07:02.993 --> 07:05.954
You're in Havenwell Hospital for...

07:07.289 --> 07:10.167
..acute...acute...

07:10.167 --> 07:12.210
I hope it's not nerves.

07:13.211 --> 07:15.338
Oh, acute depression.

07:15.338 --> 07:17.591
Sam, it's Nurse Chatam, Sam.

07:17.591 --> 07:19.676
And you recognise Freddie?

07:21.261 --> 07:23.722
Freddie?
Sure, we're old buddies, right?

07:23.722 --> 07:25.765
Wanna say hello, Sam?

07:28.768 --> 07:31.688
(WEAKLY) Hello.
Know where you are, Sam?

07:31.688 --> 07:33.899
Of course he does. I just told him.

07:33.899 --> 07:37.694
Sam, tell 'em you know where you are
so they won't think
you're a nut case.

07:37.694 --> 07:40.947
I'm a nut case?
No! You're not.

07:40.947 --> 07:43.658
No, you just had a treatment and now
you're a little tired.

07:43.658 --> 07:45.827
The guy that's in the waiting room,

07:45.827 --> 07:48.121
I think he's got some chemical
problems.

07:48.121 --> 07:51.333
He seems a little more disoriented
than usual. Go get Dr Masters.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.793
I've got Dr Beeks working full-out
on this.

07:53.793 --> 07:57.130
But she won't have any results for
14-16 hours. No!

07:57.130 --> 08:00.091
What?
No, don't leave me here.

08:00.091 --> 08:02.469
Just cool it...
Don't leave me here!

08:02.469 --> 08:04.512
He'll be right back.

08:04.512 --> 08:06.222
It's OK.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.225
You shocked me!

08:10.644 --> 08:14.981
Sam, they gave you electro-shock
treatment? God!

08:14.981 --> 08:18.234
I don't wanna stay here.
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

08:18.234 --> 08:20.070
Sam...

08:20.070 --> 08:22.155
I'm very sorry about what happened.

08:22.155 --> 08:24.366
Sorry? It looks like you tried to
kill him.

08:24.366 --> 08:28.286
Sam, everything's going to be all
right. It won't happen again,
I promise.

08:28.286 --> 08:31.289
I don't wanna stay here.
You're weak. You need to rest.

08:31.289 --> 08:35.251
No! Sam, take it easy. I got Ziggy
working overtime on this.

08:35.251 --> 08:38.421
Please, Sam, if you don't
calm down... I remember you.

08:39.756 --> 08:41.799
You gave me a...

08:43.176 --> 08:46.054
..electro-shock.
I'm sorry, Sam.

08:46.054 --> 08:48.223
It shouldn't have happened.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.601
Sam, all we have to do is figure out
why you're here.

08:51.601 --> 08:54.938
Then all you have to do is what you
have to do. Then get the hell out!

08:54.938 --> 08:57.065
OK, OK, well...

08:57.065 --> 08:59.943
Then you tell me now

08:59.943 --> 09:01.986
so that I can go home.

09:03.196 --> 09:05.615
What do you want me to tell you?
How to get out!

09:05.615 --> 09:09.577
OK, but first, we gotta get rid of
Florence Nightingale here.

09:09.577 --> 09:11.871
The way to do that is,
you've gotta chill out.

09:11.871 --> 09:14.833
OK, Sam, Dr Masters will be here in
a minute.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.001
I forgot she called in the cavalry.

09:17.001 --> 09:20.547
When he gets here, I want you to be
calm, OK, Sam?

09:20.547 --> 09:22.590
Promise me. Sam, stop it.

09:22.590 --> 09:24.676
Sam, do you promise?
OK.

09:24.676 --> 09:26.803
Come on back down.
You gotta promise.

09:26.803 --> 09:30.098
All right, Sam.
No more shocks, no more shocks.

09:31.307 --> 09:34.769
Does he know who he is?
Er, he seems to.

09:34.769 --> 09:36.896
He's not Mr Biederman.

09:36.896 --> 09:39.816
(GASPS) You get away from me!

09:39.816 --> 09:41.943
Get him outta here!
Stay back, boys.

09:41.943 --> 09:43.736
Get him...

09:43.736 --> 09:46.156
Keep away...
Do you know who I am, Sam?

09:48.408 --> 09:51.286
No.
Do you recognise Nurse Chatam?

09:51.286 --> 09:53.246
No. I don't know anyone.

09:54.164 --> 09:58.293
And I don't care what he says,
I don't have to help anybody do
anything.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.003
I don't!

10:00.003 --> 10:02.922
Who the hell is he talking to?
I told you to stay back!

10:04.507 --> 10:07.510
Why don't you have some help, Sam?
AL: Sam, listen to me.

10:07.510 --> 10:09.679
These people can't see me.

10:09.679 --> 10:14.934
I am a hologram tuned to your mind.
I'm here to help you.

10:14.934 --> 10:17.395
They can't see you?
No.

10:17.395 --> 10:19.647
Then how are you gonna help me
get out?

10:19.647 --> 10:23.526
Do you know who you are, Sam?
You are Sam Biederman.

10:23.526 --> 10:25.695
You have a wife, no children.

10:25.695 --> 10:28.698
You're here because you have an acute
case of depression. No.

10:28.698 --> 10:30.742
Do you remember who you are, Sam?
No!

10:30.742 --> 10:33.161
You're Sam...
No. No, I'm not.

10:35.914 --> 10:39.125
I'm Sam...antha.

10:40.793 --> 10:42.795
Stormer.

10:44.964 --> 10:47.008
Samantha Stormer.

10:48.551 --> 10:49.719
And...

10:51.471 --> 10:53.014
Oh, my...

10:53.014 --> 10:55.058
Oh, my, what a storm.

10:58.144 --> 11:00.188
I'm an executive secretary.

11:01.439 --> 11:03.483
At a national motor company.

11:04.609 --> 11:05.860
In...

11:07.612 --> 11:09.864
In Detroit, Michigan.

11:11.282 --> 11:13.326
You know that, silly.

11:19.624 --> 11:21.626
It's 1961.

11:23.169 --> 11:24.379
And...

11:26.839 --> 11:28.800
I'm 26...

11:29.801 --> 11:31.511
..years old.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.476
And, one day...

11:50.738 --> 11:55.034
Some day, I'm gonna join the design
programme with Gloria.

12:01.249 --> 12:04.961
I'm here because I hit Buddy Wright.
Aren't I?

12:13.845 --> 12:15.888
That's it, isn't it?

12:22.228 --> 12:24.272
Isn't it?

12:31.946 --> 12:33.865
That's it.

12:33.865 --> 12:35.908
My God, they...

12:37.285 --> 12:39.662
..pushed you over the line.
(WHIMPERS)

12:45.965 --> 12:48.134
I can't believe this is happening.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.804
I really shouldn't be punished.
You know that, don't you?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.310
Buddy Wright deserved a lot more
than a punch in the jaw.

12:58.770 --> 13:01.564
Could I have a cigarette? Please?

13:03.358 --> 13:05.526
Don't tell Gloria.

13:05.526 --> 13:08.321
She doesn't like me smoking in the
apartment, thank you.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.282
They don't let me smoke at work
either. Oh, thank you.

13:11.282 --> 13:14.035
Get Dr Wickless up here immediately.

13:14.035 --> 13:17.955
Gushie, get Dr Beeks on the scene as
soon as possible.

13:17.955 --> 13:20.541
We got problems, big-time.

13:20.541 --> 13:22.752
How long has he been like this?

13:22.752 --> 13:27.799
Well, er, he was a little
disoriented when he first woke up
from his therapy.

13:27.799 --> 13:30.510
So, you see, it's all just been a
misunderstanding.

13:30.510 --> 13:35.515
Sam, Sam... You are a scientist
named Sam Beckett.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.142
Dr Sam Beckett.

13:39.227 --> 13:40.686
Beckett...

13:41.854 --> 13:45.525
I know a Sam Beckett back in Elk
Ridge, Illinois.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.777
Indiana!
Indiana.

13:47.777 --> 13:49.904
Who's Sam Beckett?

13:49.904 --> 13:51.114
Oh...

13:52.490 --> 13:54.534
Just a boy I knew a long time ago.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.995
Yeah, you were a boy and then you
grew up

13:57.995 --> 14:00.456
and then you built a time machine...

14:00.456 --> 14:04.210
Was he a friend of yours, Sam?
..you called Project Quantum Leap.

14:05.461 --> 14:07.630
I don't remember.

14:07.630 --> 14:10.258
You don't remember whether he was
your friend or not?

14:10.258 --> 14:13.010
Of course he remembers. When you
completed it,

14:13.010 --> 14:18.057
you tried an experiment that sent you
travelling back through time,

14:18.057 --> 14:21.686
reliving little pieces of other
people's lives.

14:22.770 --> 14:25.148
Samantha, can you hear me?

14:26.524 --> 14:28.651
Doctor, is he in a trance?

14:28.651 --> 14:31.154
I think he's listening to someone.

14:31.154 --> 14:34.991
What's he looking at?
The guy! The guy in the red jacket!

14:36.868 --> 14:40.663
You can see me?
Sure. Nice jacket.

14:40.663 --> 14:44.625
Oh, great. I'm tuned into little
kids, tuned into dogs,

14:44.625 --> 14:46.836
and now I'm tuned into the mentally
absent.

14:46.836 --> 14:49.005
Why not blondes?

14:49.005 --> 14:51.424
What is it, Tibby?
Don't you say anything!

14:51.424 --> 14:55.219
Or they're gonna put you in a hole so
deep under this place, you'll never
get out!

14:55.219 --> 14:57.263
Nothing. Never mind.

14:58.389 --> 15:00.975
I don't understand what's happening.

15:00.975 --> 15:05.021
I think Mr Biederman is splitting
into a very rare psychosis

15:05.021 --> 15:07.481
known as multiple personality
disorder.

15:07.481 --> 15:09.942
When the human mind can't deal with
something,

15:09.942 --> 15:13.237
it creates a whole new personality
that can.

15:13.237 --> 15:15.781
But why?
Oh, great.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.909
Now they think you're Cybil.

15:17.909 --> 15:19.952
We've gotta talk, Sam.

15:21.871 --> 15:23.915
Samantha.

15:23.915 --> 15:26.834
Samantha, I want you to tell them

15:26.834 --> 15:29.086
that your name is Sam Biederman,

15:29.086 --> 15:32.214
that you're very tired after your
therapy.

15:32.214 --> 15:34.926
And, Samantha, if you don't,

15:34.926 --> 15:36.969
you'll never get out of here.

15:38.596 --> 15:40.681
Tell them.

15:40.681 --> 15:43.142
Doctor...
Yeah?

15:45.811 --> 15:48.773
I'm Sam Biederman. And...

15:50.066 --> 15:52.526
I'm very tired after my therapy.

15:52.526 --> 15:54.779
I was just wondering,
could I take a nap?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.740
But I would like to talk to
Samantha.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.451
Well, yes, I know, but I'm really...

16:00.451 --> 16:03.162
I'm so very, very tired from my
therapy.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.331
Couldn't I just take a nap, doctor?

16:05.331 --> 16:08.793
OK, Mr Biederman, you rest for a
while and we'll talk later.

16:10.127 --> 16:12.129
OK. Thank you.

16:13.881 --> 16:15.966
Don't tell Gloria.
No.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.134
OK.

16:18.469 --> 16:22.264
He's looking at you like you were a
frog in Bio 101.

16:22.264 --> 16:24.016
Ha, ha!

16:24.016 --> 16:26.143
But you did well, Sam.

16:26.143 --> 16:28.187
You did very well.

16:28.979 --> 16:31.357
I don't understand what just
happened.

16:31.357 --> 16:36.237
I think the voices he's been
listening to told him to say he was
Biederman so we'd go away.

16:36.237 --> 16:40.324
I want an observation room prepared
for him immediately.

16:40.324 --> 16:44.787
What is it, doctor? Mr Biederman's
showing signs of multiple
personality disorder.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.623
Nurse Chatam is preparing an
observation room...

16:50.167 --> 16:52.294
(THUNDER)

16:52.294 --> 16:54.338
(ELECTRONIC SQUEAKS)

16:57.925 --> 17:00.094
Now what?

17:00.094 --> 17:04.807
Well, I can't locate Dr Beeks. She's
the shrink. I need her.

17:04.807 --> 17:06.892
You said you could help me get outta
here.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.103
I don't really like it here.

17:09.103 --> 17:13.022
Sam, the only way you're gonna leap
outta here is if you can keep
Biederman...

17:13.022 --> 17:18.194
I mean, if we can keep you from
getting your brain fried by Dr
Frankenstein!

17:18.194 --> 17:20.239
(THUNDERCLAP)

17:24.617 --> 17:26.662
Who are you?

17:31.542 --> 17:34.378
I'm Al. I'm your buddy.

17:35.796 --> 17:38.007
I gave you your first break.

17:38.007 --> 17:42.344
You're the only person who believed
in me when I gave up believing
in myself.

17:42.344 --> 17:44.513
You brought me on this project.

17:44.513 --> 17:47.933
Why...why couldn't anyone else
see you?

17:47.933 --> 17:49.226
(THUNDER)

17:49.226 --> 17:52.479
Well, it's like I told you. I'm a
hologram.

17:52.479 --> 17:55.357
And I'm tuned into your brain waves.

17:57.234 --> 18:01.447
Look, see, I can't touch you,
I can't touch anything.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.908
You and everything around you is a
hologram to me.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.369
How did you do that?

18:07.369 --> 18:09.955
Because I'm not here. I'm 43 years
in the future.

18:18.255 --> 18:22.134
Hey, keep your hands outta me,
will you? God.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.261
I gotta check my medication.

18:24.261 --> 18:26.430
Can anyone else see you?

18:26.430 --> 18:30.434
I don't know. Er, can any of you guys
see me?

18:31.894 --> 18:34.146
(GIGGLES)
Yeah, I can.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.564
He can.

18:36.732 --> 18:39.568
Are you really from the future?
Yeah.

18:40.569 --> 18:43.405
My name is Tibby. Tibby Johnson.

18:43.405 --> 18:45.741
I'm from right here in Havenwell,
Pennsylvania.

18:45.741 --> 18:47.868
Am I in the future?

18:47.868 --> 18:49.912
Yeah, sure, you are.

18:49.912 --> 18:51.872
Sam, Sam!

18:51.872 --> 18:54.625
Now he's gone to sleep.
What is it like in the future?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.296
What is it like? I mean, is it...

18:59.296 --> 19:01.715
Is it real clean?

19:01.715 --> 19:04.510
Are there cars that float on air?

19:04.510 --> 19:08.305
No, er... The air is filthy and the
cars are still on the ground.

19:08.305 --> 19:10.683
But we're working on it, Tibby.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.893
I like your threads.

19:14.770 --> 19:17.356
Gushie, where the hell is Beeks?
Who's Gushie?

19:18.649 --> 19:20.818
The programmer.

19:20.818 --> 19:22.945
Well, never mind. I'll find her
myself.

19:24.154 --> 19:27.491
Listen, Tibby, when Sam wakes up,
would you tell him...

19:27.491 --> 19:29.952
Her, her, her.
Him, him, him!

19:31.286 --> 19:35.999
Tell him that I'll be right back and
not to talk to anyone, OK?

19:35.999 --> 19:38.335
But, please, will you tell me about
the future?

19:38.335 --> 19:40.671
(THUNDER)
A little later, OK?

19:42.339 --> 19:44.383
Keep an eye on him for me, Tibby.

19:46.009 --> 19:47.553
Wow!

19:49.179 --> 19:52.474
Man, oh, man, I love that future
stuff!

19:54.184 --> 19:56.895
(MAN CHANTS)

19:56.895 --> 19:59.648
What if he's developed more than one
personality?

19:59.648 --> 20:02.067
That's what I hope these tests will
show.

20:02.067 --> 20:05.154
Yesterday, Mr Biederman was a manic
depressive.

20:05.154 --> 20:09.366
And now he's created a whole new
world for himself.

20:10.742 --> 20:13.454
Samantha Stormer seems so real to
him.

20:13.454 --> 20:16.165
A distinct secondary personality

20:16.165 --> 20:20.878
with her own life, job, friends,
problems,

20:20.878 --> 20:23.964
eight years in the future.

20:23.964 --> 20:26.508
It doesn't follow any cases I've
read about.

20:26.508 --> 20:32.598
The Cook girl was the only multiple
personality disorder I've actually
interacted with.

20:33.974 --> 20:37.102
Hers was a result of childhood
trauma.

20:38.103 --> 20:41.815
But Sam, he's created a whole
personality

20:41.815 --> 20:44.693
totally unrelated to anything he's
ever experienced.

20:45.527 --> 20:47.988
And everything takes place in the
future.

20:49.406 --> 20:51.450
This has never happened before.

20:52.618 --> 20:57.456
It's the aspect of time displacement
that fascinates me.

21:01.960 --> 21:06.715
Perhaps we should perform some of
these tests under sodium amytal.

21:09.760 --> 21:14.389
Dr Masters, Mr Biederman is still a
patient here in need of our help.

21:14.389 --> 21:17.643
I'm a little worried that this type
of research

21:17.643 --> 21:20.812
may overshadow our interest in him
as a person.

21:21.772 --> 21:25.943
If I become overzealous, I'm sure
Dr Wickless will let me know.

21:25.943 --> 21:27.653
Thank you.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.134
Hi, Al.

21:51.134 --> 21:52.844
Hi, Tibby.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.972
Oh, any word on my future?

21:54.972 --> 21:57.015
Yeah, actually, there is.

21:58.058 --> 22:00.686
It's not all good, but that can be
changed.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.854
As a matter of fact,

22:02.854 --> 22:06.817
you're the reason Sam ended up in
this asylum in the first place.

22:06.817 --> 22:09.695
She was here to get me out?
He.

22:09.695 --> 22:12.572
Yes, yes.
But now I'm gonna do it, OK?

22:12.572 --> 22:14.449
Oh, OK, OK.

22:14.449 --> 22:16.576
How did you get in here?

22:16.576 --> 22:18.453
Headache.

22:18.453 --> 22:20.497
(THUNDER)

22:22.124 --> 22:26.044
I used to get real bad headaches
when I was little. They used to make
me crazy.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.172
My folks brought me here to get
fixed.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.384
They never came back.

22:33.343 --> 22:35.721
Too many kids, not enough food.

22:38.348 --> 22:40.642
I'm not mad at them, though.
I'm not.

22:40.642 --> 22:43.019
How's your head now?

22:43.019 --> 22:47.482
Oh, I still get 'em, but I don't
tell nobody. No, no, no.

22:47.482 --> 22:50.152
Ziggy says you've got mild Downs
Syndrome.

22:50.152 --> 22:55.449
Let's see, you're outta here in seven
years and you end up in the streets.

22:55.449 --> 22:58.034
Well, if we could find a way to
change that...

22:58.034 --> 23:00.203
Oh, Sam, I'm glad you're awake.

23:00.203 --> 23:02.622
Listen, I think we've got it figured
out.

23:02.622 --> 23:07.461
Ziggy says there's a 94% chance that
you're here to help Tibby.

23:07.461 --> 23:11.131
You're here to help Tibby. You are.
You are, you are!

23:11.131 --> 23:14.217
He can't help if you keep talking
like you're missing a few bolts.

23:14.217 --> 23:17.262
Help him do what?
Well, what we've gotta do

23:17.262 --> 23:21.475
is make sure that when he gets out of
this loony bin, he doesn't end up on
the streets.

23:21.475 --> 23:24.019
You know, set him up with a job.
Hey, Biederman!

23:24.019 --> 23:27.230
Get your things together.
In a loony bin?

23:27.230 --> 23:30.275
We like to call it "an institution
for the mentally unstable".

23:31.318 --> 23:35.822
Sam, let me know what's going on
inside that noggin of yours,
will you?

23:35.822 --> 23:37.240
Sam?

23:38.742 --> 23:41.286
Who are you talking to?
Right, Samantha.

23:41.286 --> 23:44.080
Just get your stuff together.
Masters wants you moved.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.208
Samantha?

23:46.208 --> 23:48.335
My name's Tyler.

23:48.335 --> 23:50.378
Jesse Tyler.

23:52.172 --> 23:54.883
I only sat down at that lunch
counter cos I was hungry.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.845
I don't belong to no loony bin.

24:01.556 --> 24:03.683
Oh, no, Sam.

24:03.683 --> 24:05.435
No is right.

24:07.103 --> 24:10.065
I don't think you should punish
people cos they're hungry.

24:10.899 --> 24:12.567
I had money.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.236
Yes, sir.

24:14.236 --> 24:16.947
Now, I know that colour matters to
you, but it shouldn't.

24:18.782 --> 24:21.368
Cos I had...I had money.

24:21.368 --> 24:23.495
I'd better go get Masters.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.455
Don't do this, Sam.

24:25.455 --> 24:29.084
Masters?
Sam, it took us full power

24:29.084 --> 24:31.086
to get me back here this time.

24:31.086 --> 24:34.464
All you have to do is save Tibby and
then you can leave.

24:34.464 --> 24:36.049
(LAUGHS)

24:37.050 --> 24:38.843
I can't leave.

24:38.843 --> 24:43.056
Son, I can't hardly walk. I got
rheumatism, you know.

24:43.056 --> 24:46.059
Sam, Ziggy says there's an 82%
chance...

24:47.811 --> 24:51.564
..that, if you keep switching in and
out...

24:52.565 --> 24:55.110
..to these people
that you've leapt into...

24:55.986 --> 24:58.113
..we could lose contact...

24:59.531 --> 25:01.074
..forever.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.236
Would you like to play a little game
with me, Jesse?

25:16.949 --> 25:19.243
I'm too old to be playing games.

25:20.702 --> 25:22.162
Besides...

25:24.665 --> 25:26.792
I can't read.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.961
No, you don't have to read.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.588
I just want you to look at some
pictures

25:31.588 --> 25:33.757
and tell me what you think you see.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.386
Please.

25:37.386 --> 25:39.054
Sit down.

25:40.097 --> 25:42.182
It's OK, Sam. I got power. I'm here.

25:45.185 --> 25:48.188
This is Jesse Tyler, a second
personality.

25:48.188 --> 25:51.233
He seems to be a 70-year-old negro

25:51.233 --> 25:55.821
who feels unjustly persecuted in some
sort of civil rights disturbance.

25:55.821 --> 25:59.533
He believes he's living in 1955.
Hmm.

25:59.533 --> 26:02.286
MASTERS: You just tell me what you
see.

26:09.585 --> 26:11.753
It's a mess. This ain't no picture.

26:11.753 --> 26:14.590
He wants you to use your imagination,
Sam. Sure there is.

26:14.590 --> 26:17.009
Look a little closer.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.933
Bird chitlins. A whole mess of bird
chitlins.

26:24.933 --> 26:27.060
(LAUGHTER)

26:27.060 --> 26:30.689
All right, all right. Now this one.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.608
Try this one.

26:39.948 --> 26:42.117
That's blood.

26:42.117 --> 26:44.453
What blood, Jesse?
It's Nell's blood.

26:45.913 --> 26:49.374
They ran my granddaughter off the
road, and I found her.

26:49.374 --> 26:51.752
She was bleeding bad.

26:53.211 --> 26:56.423
Miss Bailey and me, we took her to
the hospital.

26:57.758 --> 27:01.803
But it was a white hospital and they
wouldn't take her.

27:01.803 --> 27:05.390
Miss Bailey told 'em,
"You had just better."

27:07.184 --> 27:09.353
I knew what to do.

27:09.353 --> 27:12.689
"I think she severed an artery.
She'll need a transfusion..."

27:12.689 --> 27:14.900
I knew the proper medical procedure.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.944
And I told those doctors...

27:17.944 --> 27:20.280
That's because you're a medical
doctor.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.367
But I thought you said you couldn't
read? Sam Beckett is a doctor.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.494
What is it, Jesse?
Leave him alone.

27:25.494 --> 27:27.663
Sam, you've got seven degrees.

27:27.663 --> 27:29.665
I can't read!
Yes, you can.

27:29.665 --> 27:33.585
Then you couldn't know the proper
medical procedures. You can!

27:33.585 --> 27:36.046
No, I can't. No, sir.

27:37.005 --> 27:39.049
We were share croppers.

27:40.384 --> 27:43.845
My folks been slaves. They didn't do
no reading and writing.

27:43.845 --> 27:46.014
Who's he talking to?

27:46.014 --> 27:49.351
Dr Masters believes it's an
hallucination.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.395
His name is Al.

27:51.395 --> 27:55.524
Dr Wickless, this Al, is that
another one of his personalities?

27:55.524 --> 27:59.861
No, an external personality would be
the aberration of a schizophrenic,

27:59.861 --> 28:01.988
not someone with MPD.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.120
One thing about Willis, he tried
teaching me, you know.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.999
But no, I'm stubborn as a mule and
twice as slow.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.794
Sam, sit back down.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.797
If you have to talk to me, don't look
at me any more.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.299
Why not? Are you having a problem
with your friend?

28:21.299 --> 28:23.885
Because this nozzle here
can't see me

28:23.885 --> 28:27.055
and I don't want him to think you're
more crazy than he already does.

28:27.055 --> 28:30.767
So please, just let Dracula here
finish drinking your brain.

28:30.767 --> 28:33.645
What? I said, are you having a
problem with your friend?

28:33.645 --> 28:37.065
Just sit down, finish the test and we
can get the hell outta here.

28:39.109 --> 28:42.404
No problem.
I'm gonna sit right down here

28:42.404 --> 28:44.948
and finish this test so we can get
the hell outta here.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.619
I don't know who Dracula is.

28:49.619 --> 28:52.247
But I got me a powerful thirst, too.

28:53.248 --> 28:55.500
What's it take to get a man a glass
of water?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.669
Huh? Round here?

28:57.669 --> 29:00.839
Water. We'll have water in this room
from now on.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.257
OK.

29:02.257 --> 29:04.342
What do you see?

29:11.725 --> 29:15.020
Well, this here's the subatomic
structure of a quark.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.189
What the hell is a quark?

29:17.189 --> 29:19.232
I don't know what a quark is, Jesse.

29:19.232 --> 29:22.694
A quark is a micro particle of a
proton or neutron.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.739
You've got a degree in quantum
physics, too.

29:25.739 --> 29:27.782
Micro thingy...

29:30.035 --> 29:32.787
Please, Jesse, give it a try.

29:34.289 --> 29:36.333
(WAR CRIES)

29:37.500 --> 29:42.255
Jesse? Jesse, it's OK. This is part
of what we're doing. VC! VC!

29:42.255 --> 29:44.299
(WAR CRIES)

29:46.676 --> 29:49.763
Ambush! Ambush!
Pull back! Pull back!

29:52.933 --> 29:56.019
It's an ambush, sir!
What's happening?

29:56.019 --> 29:59.356
Get out!
I didn't do nothing to him.

29:59.356 --> 30:00.857
Get out!

30:02.067 --> 30:05.153
Oh, man! Oh, man!

30:05.153 --> 30:07.197
Who are you? Where are you?

30:07.197 --> 30:09.866
He's VC, sir! Oh, man!
Who are you?

30:09.866 --> 30:12.285
Oh, man, oh, man!

30:12.285 --> 30:14.329
He's VC, sir!

30:18.249 --> 30:20.377
Give him your name, rank, and serial
number.

30:20.377 --> 30:25.382
Signalman first class, Williams,
United States Navy. Number D195686.

30:27.634 --> 30:30.804
Where are you?
Signalman first class, US Navy.

30:30.804 --> 30:33.431
Herbert Williams. Serial number
D195686.

30:33.431 --> 30:35.475
Can you tell me what year it is?

30:38.311 --> 30:39.729
Seventy...

30:39.729 --> 30:42.273
70. 1970.

30:42.273 --> 30:43.692
1970?

30:43.692 --> 30:45.819
He's in the future again.

30:45.819 --> 30:49.030
Signalman, tell him that all's clear

30:49.030 --> 30:51.116
and you just wanna secure for the
night.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.743
All's clear and secure for the night!
Sleep, sleep.

30:53.743 --> 30:56.746
Sleep, sleep. You'll stay here.
You'll have a room of your own.

30:56.746 --> 30:58.790
No! You wanna get back to your own
camp.

30:58.790 --> 31:01.251
We've gotta secure our own position!
Stay here.

31:01.251 --> 31:03.002
No!
No!

31:03.002 --> 31:05.713
OK, OK.
Sleep...sleep.

31:05.713 --> 31:07.757
Whatever you say.

31:10.427 --> 31:12.220
That's it.

31:34.617 --> 31:38.538
Sam, are you awake? Sam?
Mm-mm.

31:38.538 --> 31:41.416
Listen, I've figured out what we have
to do to help Tibby.

31:41.416 --> 31:43.668
All I have to do is teach him to
read.

31:43.668 --> 31:44.919
Al.

31:46.463 --> 31:48.882
Nobody ever tried to teach me
nothing.

31:48.882 --> 31:51.843
Well, I'm going to. I'll try and
teach you to read.

31:51.843 --> 31:55.013
But I can't. I can't read.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.432
I can't learn my ABCs. I never
could.

31:58.725 --> 32:00.894
I could learn music.

32:00.894 --> 32:04.981
I learned all the words to Pig's
Foot Pete,

32:04.981 --> 32:08.318
and Scrub Me Mama With The Boogie
Beat,

32:08.318 --> 32:10.612
the very first time.

32:10.612 --> 32:13.156
That's good. Could you teach me a
song from the future?

32:14.616 --> 32:18.953
Yeah, I could teach you a song from
the future, but that wouldn't help me
teach you...

32:18.953 --> 32:21.164
Wait, maybe it would.

32:21.164 --> 32:25.335
Hey, Sam, you remember that song we
put in Ziggy's memory banks a few
years ago?

32:25.335 --> 32:29.297
No, you wouldn't remember. We were
fooling around with a rap song there.

32:31.549 --> 32:37.263
If I could just access this and maybe
get it to play through the handle...

32:37.263 --> 32:39.891
(HIP HOP BEAT)
..that'd be pretty good, huh?

32:39.891 --> 32:42.060
That's boogie woogie.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.771
No, this is rap. I've gotta make up

this is a party?

33:48.876 --> 33:52.130

What are you doing? Stop this!

33:52.130 --> 33:54.382
Oh, you think it's funny,
Mr Johnson?

33:54.382 --> 33:57.427
Hey, you people are gonna have to
clean this place up!

33:57.427 --> 33:59.554
Stop it!

33:59.554 --> 34:01.681
It's rap music.

34:01.681 --> 34:04.058
Sam, that's right.
 You remember!

34:04.058 --> 34:07.603
You used to hate rap music.
The name's Stratton, little buddy.

34:07.603 --> 34:09.688
Captain Tom Stratton.

34:10.898 --> 34:14.360
This is a loud hospital.
Is Diana in here?

34:14.360 --> 34:18.781
Oh, no, not again. What happened to
the X2? Did I do it?

34:18.781 --> 34:21.868
Sam, it doesn't matter what you did.
I just saved Tibby!

34:21.868 --> 34:25.830
He's gonna learn how to read and get
a good job when he gets out...

34:25.830 --> 34:29.208
Are you feeling all right?
Tibby's going to be OK.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.377
So you're ready to leap.

34:31.377 --> 34:35.255
Look, all I wanna know is, did I
break Mach Three?

34:36.299 --> 34:40.052
Come on, Sam, you gotta leap.
We're running out of time...

34:40.052 --> 34:42.179
Maybe it was the storm.

34:42.179 --> 34:44.724
I sure as heck don't remember...

34:49.187 --> 34:51.272
Where'd you go, little buddy?

34:54.900 --> 34:56.235
Al?

35:00.239 --> 35:02.283
(THUNDER)

35:37.134 --> 35:39.262
Hit him, Sam! Hit him!

35:39.262 --> 35:41.889
Pop him! Pop, pop, pop!

35:41.889 --> 35:45.977
(ECHOES) 'Sam, Sam, it's OK, you're
just dreaming. I'm right here, Sam.'

35:45.977 --> 35:48.020
Stay calm.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.733
Ziggy's only got ten minutes of
emergency power.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.362
I've got Dr Beeks here.

35:56.362 --> 35:59.281
And she's got a theory
to get you to leap.

35:59.281 --> 36:02.326
Where is she?
She's right here.

36:02.326 --> 36:06.330
But you can't see her because she
isn't tuned into your brain waves.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.875
Would you like to see her?

36:09.875 --> 36:12.712
Er, yeah, sure. OK.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.647
I can see her, but...
I can't hear her.

36:31.647 --> 36:35.860
Well, you can't hear her because
touching her just brings in the
image.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.154
It's kinda weird.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.613
Yeah.

36:39.613 --> 36:41.657
This whole leap is weird, Sam.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.868
The name's not Sam.
It's Kit Cody, OK?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.954
You keep saying Sam, I keep looking
around for a Sam.

36:46.954 --> 36:51.667
OK, we don't have time to argue
about that now. If you wanna get
outta here, you gotta trust me.

36:51.667 --> 36:55.671
I want out. You got that much right.
I definitely want out.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.507
Everyone here thinks you're Sam
Biederman.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.801
But I'm Kit Cody.
No, you're not!

37:00.801 --> 37:03.637
You said I was Kit Cody!
Not Samantha Stormer...

37:05.431 --> 37:08.934
OK, you're Dr Samuel Beckett.

37:08.934 --> 37:13.522
You're a quantum physicist and
you've been leaping in and out of
people's lives.

37:13.522 --> 37:19.028
So, at one time or another, you have
been Samantha Stormer, Jesse Tyler,
Herbert Williams...

37:19.028 --> 37:21.155
And Kit Cody.
And Kit Cody, yes.

37:21.155 --> 37:25.784
And Kit Cody. When you did what was
needed to change the people's lives,

37:25.784 --> 37:27.912
you leaped out.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.414
So I'm a good guy?

37:31.874 --> 37:35.169
Oh, yeah, you're a damned good guy.
Yeah.

37:35.169 --> 37:38.589
But now you're Sam Biederman.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.342
Before you had a chance to change
his life,

37:41.342 --> 37:44.762
they gave you electroshock
treatment.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.805
Hey, no more shocks, OK?

37:46.805 --> 37:50.851
The treatment kicked out your ego
and left a valley.

37:50.851 --> 37:55.814
It's a valley that's being filled by
the memories of all these people you
leaped into.

37:55.814 --> 37:58.984
I tell you, I feel a little
punch-drunk, that's for sure.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.696
Yeah, well, that's a good definition
of it.

38:05.574 --> 38:09.286
What's going on? Sam, I'm gonna have
to let Dr Beeks go.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.413
Because it's draining too much
power.

38:17.836 --> 38:19.797
Say goodbye.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.006
OK.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.134
Bye, doc.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.725
Huh!

38:33.894 --> 38:36.021
Sam?
Yeah?

38:36.021 --> 38:40.859
I think you can see that we're in
danger of losing contact with you.

38:40.859 --> 38:43.570
I don't want that you should lose
contact.

38:43.570 --> 38:46.740
Well then, you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

38:48.033 --> 38:50.327
OK, what do you want I should do?

38:50.327 --> 38:55.249
Dr Beeks says the only way you're
gonna get your ego back... Yeah?

38:56.625 --> 39:00.129
..is if you take another one of
those electroshock treatments.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.256
No.
Yes!

39:02.256 --> 39:04.299
No, no more shocks.
Yes, Sam.

39:04.299 --> 39:07.052
I just said no! No more shocks!
No way, pal.

39:07.052 --> 39:09.304
No more. Forget it.
Forget the whole thing.

39:09.304 --> 39:13.100
It's the only chance of getting
outta here! Sam, yes!

39:21.150 --> 39:24.153
You've sure been spending a lot of
time with Masters.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.865
I'm a nurse, he's a doctor. We both
happen to work for this hospital.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.075
I just didn't want you making any
mistakes.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.705
What are you talking about?

39:34.705 --> 39:38.500
I'm talking about Masters finding out
what happened to Biederman yesterday.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.255
Mr Biederman came in here as a
depressive.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.883
Six weeks later, he's showing signs
of violence.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.303
Now he's split into not one but
several personalities.

39:49.303 --> 39:53.474
If what you did yesterday has
anything to do with it, I will tell
Dr Masters.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.642
You were there, too.

39:55.642 --> 40:00.314
Weren't you? Or did you forget that
little bit of information?

40:00.314 --> 40:02.649
You lied to me.
You told me Dr Masters...

40:02.649 --> 40:05.903
You know the rules, Nurse Chatam.
Too bad you didn't stop me.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.447
I did try to stop you!
But you didn't.

40:10.365 --> 40:12.493
You could have killed him.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.037
WE could have.

40:42.648 --> 40:43.982
Ha, ha!

40:49.029 --> 40:52.199
He told us this morning his name was
Jimmy LaMotta.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.368
He says he has a real job.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.787
Again, this personality lives in the
future.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.998
We can tell from his speech patterns

40:59.998 --> 41:02.209
and his physical impediments

41:02.209 --> 41:05.504
that the personality of Jimmy is
retarded.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.590
Thank you!
He calls himself a special person.

41:08.590 --> 41:11.843
Did you pinpoint yet what first
brought on this change in behaviour?

41:11.843 --> 41:15.681
Dr Masters suspects that the
electroshock therapy yesterday

41:15.681 --> 41:19.017
might have triggered some traumatic
childhood memories.

41:19.017 --> 41:22.521
Mr Biederman's inability to cope
with those memories

41:22.521 --> 41:25.524
opened a floodgate of people.

41:25.524 --> 41:29.111
People in his mind? People he
invented to protect himself.

41:29.111 --> 41:31.113
Wait a minute. From what?

41:31.113 --> 41:36.493
According to his family history,
nothing traumatic occurred in his
childhood or young adult life

41:36.493 --> 41:38.996
that would merit anything like this.

41:38.996 --> 41:42.332
Unless those traumas never
registered in his conscious mind.

41:42.332 --> 41:44.334
Hello, doctor.
Hello, Jimmy.

41:44.334 --> 41:45.919
Hi.

41:45.919 --> 41:47.879
Bye, Freddie.
Bye, Jimmy.

41:47.879 --> 41:49.423
Hi.
Hi.

41:50.882 --> 41:53.051
When's lunch?
Soon.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.388
Wanna build a ship?

41:56.388 --> 41:58.557
What kind of ship, Jimmy?

42:01.768 --> 42:03.937
Space ship.

42:03.937 --> 42:06.815
(WHOOSH OF AL MATERIALISING)
It's time, Sam.

42:08.817 --> 42:12.237
Tell the doctor that you want
another therapy session.

42:12.237 --> 42:16.700
But I don't. You have to have it
or I won't be able to come back.

42:16.700 --> 42:21.913
You come back! Then tell the doctor
you want another shock treatment.

42:23.373 --> 42:27.044
Is it your friend, Al? Al said you'd
better give Jimmy shock or...

42:27.044 --> 42:30.380
he go back to the future forever.

42:34.342 --> 42:36.511
Al, don't leave Jimmy!

42:36.511 --> 42:39.056
Tell him!
He's not gonna leave you, Jimmy.

42:39.056 --> 42:42.893
What's happening?
Through all the personality changes,

42:42.893 --> 42:44.978
two things have remained constant:

42:44.978 --> 42:49.941
an invisible friend named Al and the
memory of his last electroshock
therapy session.

42:49.941 --> 42:53.153
Sam, I'm running out of time. Ziggy's
out of power.

42:53.153 --> 42:55.739
He's using all he's got just to keep
us connected.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.699
Come on, come on. Jimmy!

42:57.699 --> 43:00.535
Let's sit down and play some games.

43:00.535 --> 43:02.329
Tell him!

43:02.329 --> 43:06.374
Al says, you give Jimmy shock
or Al go away!

43:06.374 --> 43:09.127
Al won't go away unless
you want him to! Yes, I will!

43:09.127 --> 43:11.296
We need to restrain him.

43:11.296 --> 43:13.465
SAM: And it's all Dr Master's fault!

43:13.465 --> 43:16.885
It's your fault! All doctor's fault!
Jimmy!

43:16.885 --> 43:20.180
I'll be gone forever unless you give
it him now! Jimmy!

43:20.180 --> 43:22.349
Give Jimmy shock!

43:22.349 --> 43:25.101
Come here! Get off him!
Give Jimmy shock!

43:28.104 --> 43:30.273
Al! Help! Give me help!

43:30.273 --> 43:32.818
I can't help you unless you get
another shock!

43:33.819 --> 43:37.030
Get me a straitjacket!
He doesn't need a straitjacket!

43:37.030 --> 43:40.158
I'll give you a shock, you freak!
Prepare for electroshock!

43:40.158 --> 43:44.496
Yes, sir. That'll be two sessions in
48 hours. You could kill him.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.874
Nurse, shut up! I said prepare the
electric shock room!

43:48.959 --> 43:51.211
Let Jimmy go! Let Jimmy go!

43:52.879 --> 43:55.590
Get him in there! Come on!
No!

43:55.590 --> 43:58.093
No! Let Jimmy go!

43:58.093 --> 44:01.096
Let Jimmy go!
Get him in there! Come on!

44:01.096 --> 44:02.931
(ECHOES) No! No!

44:04.391 --> 44:06.017
Al...

44:06.017 --> 44:08.103
Don't leave me.
I won't, Sam.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.606
Don't leave.
I won't, Sam.

44:11.606 --> 44:13.567
Set the voltage.

44:13.567 --> 44:16.444
Doctor, I really think after his
session yesterday...

44:16.444 --> 44:19.864
If you can't perform as a
professional, I don't need you in
this room.

44:19.864 --> 44:21.825
Do I make myself clear?

44:21.825 --> 44:25.579
Sam, tell him you've gotta have the
same voltage as yesterday.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.082
Tell him!
We're almost there, doctor.

44:29.082 --> 44:31.293
It hurts.
Tell him!

44:31.293 --> 44:34.129
You'll be fine. Everything'll be
fine, I promise.

44:34.129 --> 44:36.631
Gushie, turn the power up.

44:36.631 --> 44:39.259
Turn it up to the max! You gotta
keep me here.

44:39.259 --> 44:42.554
Come on, Sam. Tell him, buddy.

44:42.554 --> 44:44.681
I can't hang on much longer.

44:44.681 --> 44:47.225
The same shock as yesterday!

44:47.225 --> 44:49.477
The same shock as yesterday!
No!

44:49.477 --> 44:51.688
Yes! It's gotta be the same as
yesterday!

44:51.688 --> 44:53.648
The same as Butcher did yesterday!

44:53.648 --> 44:56.359
What was the voltage Dr Wickless set
yesterday?

44:56.359 --> 44:58.445
It wasn't Dr Wickless, it was Butch.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.447
Butch?
Yes.

45:00.447 --> 45:03.867
You administered electroshock without
a doctor present?

45:03.867 --> 45:05.910
I don't remember.

45:06.911 --> 45:10.832
What was the voltage set?
It was set at 200.

45:10.832 --> 45:13.793
Now! Now!
Give shock now!

45:13.793 --> 45:17.380
He got angry cos Sam hit him, so he
punished him by turning up the
voltage.

45:17.380 --> 45:20.842
That's a lie! You had the audacity
to take that kind of control?

45:20.842 --> 45:24.054
Do it!
Save Jimmy.

45:24.054 --> 45:26.181
I told you to prep them.

45:26.181 --> 45:28.016
Save Sam.

45:29.684 --> 45:31.853
Please, 200.

45:31.853 --> 45:35.482
No, that's too high!
Tell him.

45:35.482 --> 45:38.360
..a doctor, now a registered nurse.
Oh, God.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.988
I don't care! Not without medical
procedure!

45:43.406 --> 45:47.035
You had the audacity to take that
kind of control. All right.

45:47.035 --> 45:49.704
Why would she lie, Butch?
Do it!

45:49.704 --> 45:51.748
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES)

45:53.541 --> 45:56.628
I was doing what you told me!
I told you to prep them!

45:56.628 --> 45:58.671
Without medical staff present?

46:01.299 --> 46:04.135
Put your head down.
Put your head down, Sam!

46:06.012 --> 46:08.139
I have never ordered you to
administer shocks.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.976
(THUNDER)

46:24.114 --> 46:25.657
Do it!

46:47.262 --> 46:48.763
Sam?

46:48.763 --> 46:50.807
Sam, you OK?

46:51.850 --> 46:54.727
Al?
You OK?

46:54.727 --> 46:57.564
You must sleep with me.
Oh, we did it, Sam.

47:00.817 --> 47:04.153
Sam, what the hell am I doing in
this uniform?

47:05.864 --> 47:07.907
What's going on, Sam?

47:11.494 --> 47:12.996
I think...

47:14.873 --> 47:16.666
Come here.

47:24.591 --> 47:26.759
Sam, what the hell's happening, huh?

47:42.233 --> 47:44.360
BOTH: Oh, boy!
