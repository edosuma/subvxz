(lighter flicks)

19:35.440 --> 19:37.341
$4.25, please.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.543
Hey, uh...

19:39.344 --> 19:41.179
Who's the honey running drinks?

19:41.813 --> 19:43.214
Oh, uh, which one?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.351
You a chubby chaser?

19:48.153 --> 19:50.021
-No.
-John: You like the big girls?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.289
No, I don't like big girls.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.558
-No?
-Walt: No.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.793
Well, then I think
you know which one.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.363
Well, her name is Daisy, why?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.265
Oh, it's a pretty name.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.335
Kind of sounds wholesome
and pure.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.536
What are you, psychic?

20:05.737 --> 20:07.138
(John laughs)
You just know people?

20:08.574 --> 20:12.243
Hey, buddy, am I treading
on your turf, stud?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.744
No, no, no.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.513
'Cause if I am, you
know, like, let me know.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.915
-No, it's not--
-John: I'll back off, you know.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.752
No, I, we have a
platonic, professional,

20:21.754 --> 20:23.421
working relationship,
we're co-workers.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.289
If you say so.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.492
Can I get you anything else,
or are we good here, for now?

20:28.494 --> 20:30.027
I don't know, you got a menu?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.529
-You got a menu, like takeout?
-No, we don't.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.598
We don't do menu
stuff, here, at all.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.966
But I got chips, you want chips?

20:35.734 --> 20:37.668
Uh, maybe later.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.970
Okay, we're good.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.172
Yeah. I'm crazy about
this, uh... The tank top.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.273
(clears throat)

20:53.185 --> 20:54.252
Daisy: Excuse me.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.454
Hi.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.190
This sections for
wait service only.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.425
Oh, uh...

21:02.394 --> 21:05.396
I'm sorry, I'll get
outta your way, then.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.764
Nah, nah, you can stay here.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.032
Just when you need another one,

21:08.300 --> 21:09.600
let me know and I'll
get it for you, okay?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.335
Okay.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.971
Mm. I'm ready.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.306
Impressive.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.707
That's what she said.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.610
I bet she did.

21:25.584 --> 21:26.784
Whiskey and Coke.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.452
Hold the Coke.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.887
Be right up.

21:37.629 --> 21:42.700
(ice rattles)

21:47.172 --> 21:49.540
Here you go, handsome.
Straight whiskey.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.876
Thanks.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.912
What happened to Daisy?

21:54.914 --> 21:58.316
Her shift ended, so you've
been transferred over to me.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.151
My name's Margo.

22:00.952 --> 22:04.288
Don't worry, doll. I'll
take real good care of you.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.424
You just let me know if
you need anything else.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.225
Okay.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.866
(ice rattles)

22:24.643 --> 22:25.910
(glass clinks)

22:31.950 --> 22:34.385
(Daisy breathes heavily)

22:40.292 --> 22:44.228
<i>♪ Just give me some
noise pollution ♪</i>

22:44.230 --> 22:48.366

22:48.368 --> 22:52.503

23:05.418 --> 23:08.419
Fuck me!
(breathes heavily)

23:08.421 --> 23:09.920
Forgot about that one.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.789
Damn near put my eye out.

23:12.657 --> 23:13.891
Shit!

23:13.893 --> 23:17.495
(Bubba hums)
(meat sizzles)

23:23.101 --> 23:25.603
Whoo! Feeling strong!

23:26.571 --> 23:27.772
Look at that.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.473
Oh, no, smell that.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.575
(Bubba sniffs)
Oh, yeah!

23:31.577 --> 23:32.877
Bubba: Eugh!

23:32.879 --> 23:34.612
-Like you, sometimes!
-Yeesh!

23:34.946 --> 23:36.414
Daisy: Get these bitches off.

23:37.682 --> 23:39.750
(zipper rasps)
(Bubba clears his throat)

23:39.752 --> 23:42.153
I'm sorry. Jeez.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.922
Ah!

23:45.123 --> 23:46.557
I forgot we switched
up the traps.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.526
Damn near got an
arrow through my head,

23:48.528 --> 23:49.560
you know what I'm talkin' about?

23:49.562 --> 23:50.661
(Bubba huffs)

23:51.096 --> 23:55.433
Oh, I'm sorry, Bubba.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.802
I'm not really
hungry this morning.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.470
(sighs)

23:59.638 --> 24:01.972
Oh, why don't you just
put it in the fridge

24:01.974 --> 24:03.207
and I'll heat it up later, okay?

24:03.209 --> 24:04.375
Bubba: Mm-hm.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.680
I love you, Bubba. Gimme a hug.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.783
(hums)

24:16.455 --> 24:18.956
Oh, I might hit Nealies
for a beer, later.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.091
I won't be late, I promise.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.359
(Bubba snorts)

24:26.131 --> 24:30.868
(water sprays)

24:47.486 --> 24:49.253
(Daisy moans)

24:57.128 --> 24:58.395
(static)

24:58.663 --> 25:00.064
Damn, Daisy.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.199
Let's you and me have
a drink, or something.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.180
(Daisy moans)

25:19.851 --> 25:22.553
Daisy Do, Daisy Do,

25:22.555 --> 25:25.456
I love you.
(Daisy moans)

25:31.396 --> 25:33.063
(Daisy squeals)

25:37.168 --> 25:39.737
(pounding on door)
(Bubba growls)

25:40.639 --> 25:45.543
(water drains)

25:47.379 --> 25:49.713
It's okay, Bubba,
I'll be right out!

25:55.353 --> 25:56.420
(engine dies)

26:04.596 --> 26:05.930
(bell rings)

26:06.998 --> 26:08.332
Welcome to Pines Motel,

26:08.334 --> 26:09.733
my name is Charlie,
can I help you?

26:09.735 --> 26:10.801
Hope so.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.037
I'm looking for someone who
might've checked in recently.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.171
White male, mid-30s,

26:14.506 --> 26:16.106
may have signed in
under the name John Doe.

26:18.109 --> 26:20.644
Sorry, can't give out
personal info on guests.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.546
-Charlie: Company policy.
-Frye: Really?

26:22.548 --> 26:24.248
How about now? Detective Frye.

26:26.351 --> 26:27.618
Not without a warrant.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.453
Now, listen here, you
fucking little midget.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.921
I can make your
life more miserable

26:30.923 --> 26:32.423
than it already is,
and this goes for

26:32.425 --> 26:34.692
the shithole of a hotel
you got here, too.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.863
What?

26:40.932 --> 26:44.602
(whimpers)

26:44.604 --> 26:46.637
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.977
(Charlie cries noisily)

26:55.413 --> 26:56.513
Listen, man, I'm...

26:58.883 --> 26:59.950
I'm sorry.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.621
Really.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.025
I shouldn't be taking my
frustrations out on you.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.561
It's just this guy
that I'm trying to find

27:10.563 --> 27:12.663
brings the kind of trouble
you don't want in this town.

27:13.231 --> 27:14.898
And certainly not in your hotel.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.667
It's just there's a
lot of innocent victims

27:16.669 --> 27:18.002
out there who deserve justice.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.170
Charlie: Mm-hm.

27:20.505 --> 27:22.006
One of which is my daughter.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.647
Checked in a few days ago.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.382
Is he still here?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.250
Charlie: As far
as I know, yeah.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.653
Was he with anyone
when he checked in?

27:36.187 --> 27:37.521
Nope, all by himself.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.426
Suppose you couldn't
tell me his room number?

27:42.761 --> 27:44.895
-That, I can't do.
-Frye: Understood.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.565
But, I can give you
the room next to his.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.403
Now, you're a good
man, Charlie Brent.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.409
All right, watch
out for that guy.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.277
Thank you.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.612
(keys jingle)
Rest easy, detective Frye.

28:01.614 --> 28:02.780
Thank you.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.886
Woman: Babe,
you're so handsome.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.054
What?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.022
-I love you.
-I love you.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.357
Are you trashed?

28:13.558 --> 28:15.926
I can taste your bubble gum.
(woman laughs)

28:17.195 --> 28:19.797
(couple laughs together)

28:25.804 --> 28:26.870
Hi.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.773
Hi.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.076
What's her problem?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.911
-Man: I don't know.
-Woman: She's so weird.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.646
Sorry to interrupt, but,

28:35.648 --> 28:37.081
you guys are just
such a cute couple.

28:37.482 --> 28:38.549
Thank you.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.484
Fuck.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.920
She's so creepy.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.154
Who cares?

28:45.423 --> 28:47.157
You must not be
from around here.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.760
Just passing through.

28:52.097 --> 28:53.263
Woman: Why?

28:53.565 --> 28:54.665
-Do you think she's cute?
-Man: No.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.234
Man: Are you kidding me?

28:59.871 --> 29:02.005
Woman: She's still staring.

29:02.007 --> 29:06.744
Fuck off!
(Daisy laughs)

29:09.347 --> 29:11.281
(woman whispers)
She's fucking annoying.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.452
<i>Daisy:
I'm tired of being alone.</i>

29:17.689 --> 29:19.189
<i>Sure, there's Bubba.</i>

29:20.358 --> 29:22.359
But a girl has needs, you know?

29:22.927 --> 29:25.629
<i>A brother can only do so much.</i>

29:25.631 --> 29:28.031
<i>Not like we're a couple
a inbred, or anything,</i>

29:28.033 --> 29:31.301
'cause we're not,
that's just plain sick.

29:31.903 --> 29:35.305
Fucking your brother,
or your sister.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.508
Ha!

29:38.243 --> 29:39.843
Or your daughter.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.950
I mean...

29:48.319 --> 29:50.120
I'm cute, right?

29:50.655 --> 29:52.055
(man grunts in pain)

29:54.425 --> 29:56.160
I'm in good shape.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.961
(groans)

30:03.134 --> 30:05.335
Why wouldn't a guy
want a girl like me?

30:05.837 --> 30:07.938
(woman pants)

30:07.940 --> 30:09.306
What do you care?

30:09.308 --> 30:10.974
Little Miss Happy?

30:11.609 --> 30:16.680
You found your Mister Right.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.854
(man gasps)
(blood gushes)

30:25.924 --> 30:27.691
Oh, well!

30:30.328 --> 30:32.329
Nothing lasts forever.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.901
(Daisy sighs)
Calm down, now, shh.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.404
Shh.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.207
Come here, come here.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.409
Get a little lower.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.448
Stop, hey!

30:51.883 --> 30:53.116
I know.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.453
You can come home with me!

30:57.155 --> 30:58.722
I'm sure Bubba wouldn't mind.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.724
In fact, he'd love the company.

31:01.559 --> 31:05.696
Maybe he'll even let you stay
with him in the basement!

31:05.698 --> 31:10.467
(woman hyperventilates)

31:17.575 --> 31:18.709
May I help you, man?

31:19.711 --> 31:20.777
Ah...

31:24.148 --> 31:25.215
Hey,

31:26.651 --> 31:30.554
you uh, got any pointy ends?

31:31.522 --> 31:32.589
Sorry, what?

31:33.157 --> 31:34.791
Pointy ends, you got 'em?

31:36.761 --> 31:39.196
You're asking me if
I have "pointy ends"?

31:39.198 --> 31:40.564
Yeah. Yeah.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.666
I don't underst... Um...

31:43.768 --> 31:45.369
I'm gonna make this
simple for you, okay?

31:45.371 --> 31:47.037
Uh...

31:47.039 --> 31:49.072
Ever use a toothpick on
those yellow teeth of yours?

31:50.608 --> 31:51.675
Yeah.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.710
Yeah.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.445
Were they round or flat?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.581
Cashier: Uh, I don't know.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.149
Wood, or plastic?

32:00.351 --> 32:01.685
Both, I guess.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.121
Did you ever notice
how those plastic ones

32:04.123 --> 32:07.624
are so god damn sharp when
you stick 'em in your mouth?

32:08.259 --> 32:13.363
If you're not careful, they
cram you right in the gums

32:13.365 --> 32:14.631
and the tongue, and they just...

32:14.866 --> 32:16.466
They're like someone
stabbing you in the face

32:16.468 --> 32:18.035
with a hypodermic
needle, it's like...

32:18.037 --> 32:19.703
(sucks air through teeth)

32:19.705 --> 32:20.804
You ever notice that?

32:21.906 --> 32:24.041
But, at the same time,

32:24.043 --> 32:27.477
that pain feels good,
in a weird way.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.478
You know?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.913
And uh...

32:29.915 --> 32:32.783
Gives you a kind of
crazy little rush,

32:32.785 --> 32:34.918
so you just keep, you just keep

32:34.920 --> 32:39.256
poking your gums and
tongue, your cheek, and...

32:39.258 --> 32:44.061
You just...
(moans)

32:46.464 --> 32:49.299
Ah, fucking the pain is
just so fucking good, man,

32:49.301 --> 32:51.468
you just can't get enough!

32:59.110 --> 33:01.511
Those, my friend,

33:02.280 --> 33:05.248
are called pointy ends.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.152
You got 'em?

33:10.188 --> 33:12.990
Sorry, man, we don't have
plastic toothpicks, here.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.192
Fuck!

33:18.296 --> 33:19.663
All right.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.365
All right, just gimme
a pack of the...

33:21.367 --> 33:25.369
The red death, the red
one, the red, the red pack.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.904
Oh, shit.

33:28.940 --> 33:32.876
All right, this'll be $7.90.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.778
That's too, that's too much.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.380
This is too mu...
That's too much.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.115
Keep it. Keep it.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.149
You gave me 10.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.350
Keep it. No, thank you.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.551
Thank you for your help.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.687
-Cashier: That's too much.
-Keep it.

33:44.055 --> 33:45.055
(thud)
Oh!

33:45.057 --> 33:46.123
-Woman: Oh, God!
-Ah!

33:46.125 --> 33:47.290
Woman: I'm so sorry.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.293
I'm sorry. Thanks.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.695
I'm so sorry.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.130
This day has been
a total disaster,

33:53.132 --> 33:54.364
let me buy you a new pack.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.266
Buy me a drink, instead.

33:58.136 --> 33:59.736
I mean...

33:59.738 --> 34:01.638
I mean, it's already
beer 30, honey, let's go.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.706
Jeez.

34:04.509 --> 34:05.776
Margo: Hurt me three times.

34:06.010 --> 34:06.977
Walt: It's not about
the drinks, though.

34:06.979 --> 34:08.645
You wear too much makeup.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.648
I don't need advice from
you on my attire, all right?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.150
Just make my drinks,

34:13.152 --> 34:14.251
-for God's sake--
-Just the eye shadow.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.585
Take it down, a little bit.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.853
You know, like, you're
scaring the customers.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.422
Margo: Take it down?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.558
Yeah, a little bit. It's a
little whorish, a little bit.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.626
(Frye whistles)
(Margo huffs)

34:22.860 --> 34:23.793
(Frye snaps his fingers)
Excuse me.

34:25.696 --> 34:26.830
Hey, what can I get ya?

34:27.165 --> 34:28.331
Yeah, I was
wondering if you recall

34:28.333 --> 34:29.866
seeing a guy in here, recently.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.536
Uh, dark hair, kind of
intense-looking fellow,

34:32.538 --> 34:33.737
likes his whiskey.

34:34.705 --> 34:35.871
No, I don't know, why?

34:35.873 --> 34:36.907
You a cop, or something?

34:36.909 --> 34:37.908
That makes a difference?

34:37.909 --> 34:38.975
Yeah, I'm a cop.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.342
Oh, that's cool.

34:40.344 --> 34:41.545
Yeah, there was a guy like that

34:41.547 --> 34:43.179
in here a couple nights ago.

34:43.181 --> 34:47.184
Uh, I don't know, he had
a drink and then split.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.452
That it?

34:48.454 --> 34:49.786
I don't know, it
was a busy night.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.688
He was in here, he had a drink,

34:51.690 --> 34:54.024
and then he split, I
didn't talk to him at all.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.257
Margo: Yes you did!

34:55.260 --> 34:56.259
-Walt: When?
-You had an entire

34:56.261 --> 34:57.427
conversation with him.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.562
I did not.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.630
When he asked you about Daisy?

35:01.199 --> 35:02.399
Oh, yeah.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.633
-Margo: He--
-Who's Daisy?

35:04.035 --> 35:06.002
The other cocktail waitress.
Cute. Real sweet.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.738
The guy was eyeballing her
like nobody's business.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.907
-Frye: Is Daisy here?
-Margo: No, she's off, tonight.

35:10.909 --> 35:11.942
Well, when's her next shift?

35:11.944 --> 35:13.443
Oh, day after tomorrow.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.613
Why all the questions?
What's this all about?

35:16.981 --> 35:18.348
No particular reason.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.317
Nice talking to you.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.685
Yeah, well nice
talking to you, too.

35:25.389 --> 35:26.656
I think that
customer needs you--

35:26.658 --> 35:28.391
Oh, yeah, all right.
Sorry.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.293
Thank you for your help, Miss.
You have a good evening.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.795
You too.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.033
(John moans)

35:39.337 --> 35:41.905
Caroline: Yeah.
(both moan)

35:45.910 --> 35:48.812
Yeah.
(both moan)

35:52.683 --> 35:57.420
(breathing slows)

36:00.491 --> 36:03.260
Not exactly how I thought
I'd be spending the night.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.562
Nice little surprise, for me.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.332
John: Oh, I'm full
of surprises, babe.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.301
Is that so?

36:11.303 --> 36:13.703
John: Yeah, that's right.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.772
Hang on.

36:18.142 --> 36:19.209
Damn.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.679
Hold on, right there.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.789
Caroline: Ooh, whatcha
got there, big boy?

36:35.326 --> 36:36.493
It's uh...

36:36.495 --> 36:37.561
It's a surprise.

36:37.795 --> 36:38.862
Oh, really?

36:41.532 --> 36:42.866
Roll over.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.635
I like surprises.
(John laughs)

36:58.349 --> 36:59.482
(Caroline gasps)

37:03.354 --> 37:04.654
That is freezing!

37:05.256 --> 37:07.857
Oh, are these chickens?

37:07.859 --> 37:09.993
Oh, no, those are roosters.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.629
I have two cocks
fighting over my ass.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.834
Well, right now three.

37:17.836 --> 37:22.606
(spoons clack together)

37:27.178 --> 37:31.014
<i>♪ I've got two cocks</i>

37:31.016 --> 37:33.783
<i>♪ Fighting over my ass</i>

37:36.721 --> 37:41.224
♪ I've got two cocks fighting

37:41.226 --> 37:44.561

37:44.563 --> 37:45.595

37:45.597 --> 37:47.964

37:47.966 --> 37:50.267
<i>♪ I drink too much wine</i>

37:50.269 --> 37:52.035

-Three.</i>

37:52.037 --> 37:53.236

37:53.238 --> 37:57.707

37:57.709 --> 37:58.875

38:00.645 --> 38:04.881
(John grunts)
(Caroline screams)

38:04.883 --> 38:09.886
(knife squishes into flesh)
(John breathes heavily)

38:26.404 --> 38:27.637
(lighter flicks)

38:40.618 --> 38:41.685
Here we go.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.533
Here we go, fucking...

39:00.471 --> 39:01.671
That's beautiful.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.579
Hm.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.583
I absolve you, baby.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.456
(yells)

39:22.727 --> 39:24.961
(cleaver whacks repeatedly)

39:52.857 --> 39:54.424
(Daisy sighs)

39:55.693 --> 39:57.794
Hey, Bubba, can I
ask you something?

40:00.164 --> 40:02.165
Do you ever get bored, alone?

40:04.835 --> 40:07.370
Aside from Dad.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.471
I mean,

40:09.940 --> 40:13.410
someone else to call your own.

40:13.412 --> 40:17.147
To hold on to. Laugh with.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.416
(Daisy sighs)

40:20.751 --> 40:23.586
To take care of.
(cleaver whacks)

40:23.588 --> 40:24.788
Never mind!

40:26.590 --> 40:28.324
You're right, it's silly.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.662
Better go get ready for work.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.332
Thanks for the
pep talk, brother.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.303
(Bubba growls)

41:24.748 --> 41:28.651
(floor squeaks)

42:10.828 --> 42:15.899
(floor squeaks)

42:21.572 --> 42:24.674
If you were a good
cop, then you'd know

42:24.676 --> 42:27.544
that breaking and entering
is against the law.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.982
I know what you are, John Doe.

42:35.853 --> 42:37.387
You're a fucking pussy.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.560
Careful.

42:43.894 --> 42:47.463
Don't want to get too close to
the flame, Detective Frye.

42:55.673 --> 42:58.808
You're standing in my room
with your fucking shoes on!

43:01.178 --> 43:02.679
You're going down.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.219
-Oh, yeah?
-Frye: Oh, yeah.

43:10.221 --> 43:11.287
Maybe.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.789
No, no, it's for real.

43:15.125 --> 43:16.693
You like tattoos, John?

43:17.428 --> 43:19.295
My daughter had a bunch of 'em.

43:19.297 --> 43:20.663
No.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.166
Didn't understand it,
or her much at the time.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.234
'Cause she was taken from me

43:25.236 --> 43:26.569
before I had a chance to realize

43:26.571 --> 43:28.137
what a great kid she was.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.641
She was a great kid, John.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.144
Her name was Dora.

43:36.246 --> 43:38.748
Means "God's Gift" in Spanish.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.083
John: That's deep, Frye.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.651
Yeah, real deep, huh?

43:41.952 --> 43:44.387
But you wouldn't know anything
about God, would you, John?

43:49.159 --> 43:50.526
I am God.

43:51.996 --> 43:53.696
In your fucking dreams!
(engine revs)

43:54.598 --> 43:55.665
John: Bye!

44:01.472 --> 44:05.441
(crickets chirp)

44:05.443 --> 44:08.745
(muted conversation)

44:17.855 --> 44:19.155
Finishing up for the night?

44:19.757 --> 44:21.257
Yeah.

44:21.625 --> 44:24.227
After I wipe down these
last few, I'm headed home.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.498
Oh, okay.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.566
Why don't you have a
drink with me, instead?

44:33.604 --> 44:35.004
No, thanks.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.041
-No, thanks?
-Mm-hm.

44:38.043 --> 44:39.509
John: No, thanks.

44:39.710 --> 44:43.212
I mean, you look like you
could use a stiff one.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.284
You've been working all night,

44:48.286 --> 44:50.553
now here we are, and--

44:50.555 --> 44:52.221
What kind of stiff one?

44:52.223 --> 44:53.890
I, any kind.

44:53.892 --> 44:55.692
You know, I would love to.

44:56.293 --> 44:58.861
You know, the night is
young, and we are beautiful.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.129
Like, what is...

45:00.564 --> 45:01.564
Yeah.

45:01.566 --> 45:02.899
Just one drink, please.

45:02.901 --> 45:04.067
-Just come.
-You're kinda creepy.

45:04.069 --> 45:05.234
Have a drink with me!

45:05.703 --> 45:07.203
I totally appreciate the offer,

45:07.205 --> 45:10.673
but I said no, thanks,
I can't, buzz off.

45:10.675 --> 45:13.409
Yes, you can. You can.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.645
I mean, just one, please.

45:15.647 --> 45:16.713
I mean, we'll have one drink.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.081
One, and we're done.

45:18.083 --> 45:20.083
Otherwise it's two,
and we're through.

45:20.085 --> 45:22.318
Okay, two. But
no more than that.

45:22.686 --> 45:23.820
Got it, Bob?

45:24.388 --> 45:25.588
Name's John.

45:26.490 --> 45:28.491
As in John the Baptist?

45:30.761 --> 45:31.828
Yeah.

45:32.262 --> 45:33.996
Something like that, yeah.

45:35.699 --> 45:38.167
Something tells me
you ain't no saint.

45:38.169 --> 45:41.838
Well something's telling
you the wrong shit.

45:47.544 --> 45:48.745
(Daisy laughs)

45:53.417 --> 45:54.717
Fuck you!

45:54.719 --> 45:56.119
It's true, scout's honor.

45:56.121 --> 45:58.321
Like you were ever a scout.

45:59.223 --> 46:00.690
As a matter of fact,

46:00.692 --> 46:01.924
-There's no way.
-I wa--

46:01.926 --> 46:03.559
-Don't even try it!
-I was!

46:03.561 --> 46:05.294
You're looking at
the bona fide scout's scout.

46:05.296 --> 46:07.096
I'm the most highly
decorated member of my troop.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.898
You drop me off in the
forest with a Band-Aid

46:08.900 --> 46:11.567
and a pack of matches, thank
you, I'll make it home.

46:11.569 --> 46:12.802
I'm a nature boy to the core.

46:12.804 --> 46:14.303
Such a liar.

46:14.805 --> 46:17.874
John: And what possible
reason would I have to lie?

46:17.876 --> 46:19.008
To get in my pants.

46:20.410 --> 46:21.944
Excuse me.

46:21.946 --> 46:24.614
All men lie to get laid,
it's common knowledge.

46:25.382 --> 46:26.682
I never lie.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.985
You got a penis, right?

46:31.455 --> 46:33.322
Let me check.
Yeah, I got a penis.

46:33.324 --> 46:34.390
(Daisy laughs)

46:34.392 --> 46:35.858
Then you lie.

46:36.059 --> 46:38.795
Okay, okay, so if we're
gonna go judging each other

46:38.797 --> 46:40.763
based on gross generalizations,

46:40.765 --> 46:42.298
then I guess it's fair to assume

46:42.300 --> 46:43.800
that because you've
got these amazing tits

46:43.802 --> 46:45.334
I'm supposed to buy all
the drinks, tonight.

46:46.270 --> 46:48.171
That's not fair,
I got a round!

46:48.839 --> 46:49.972
What round?

46:49.974 --> 46:51.240
Uh...

46:51.242 --> 46:52.408
The next one.

46:52.410 --> 46:53.476
Hey!

46:53.911 --> 46:55.611
Another couple drinks over here

46:55.613 --> 46:57.246
when you get the chance, please.

46:58.081 --> 46:59.182
Whoo!

46:59.184 --> 47:00.249
Thank you, honey.

47:00.251 --> 47:01.717
Those drinks are on me.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.054
Huh.

47:05.489 --> 47:07.156
You cheated on me.

47:08.091 --> 47:09.525
You're a cheater.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.628
It was your idea, implying
I have tits, and all.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.197
Which I do.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.032
But you'll never know.

47:16.767 --> 47:18.100
Hm, hm, hm.

47:18.102 --> 47:20.736
I'll drink to that.
(glasses clink)

47:24.708 --> 47:27.076
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

47:28.445 --> 47:29.879
I'm gonna go piss.

47:32.115 --> 47:33.950
Thank you.
My name's Crash,

47:33.952 --> 47:35.451
I'm gonna take
a 15 minute shit,

47:35.453 --> 47:37.687
and go check that
nobody's fucking my wife.

47:38.488 --> 47:39.622
Thank you.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.102
Hey, uh, can I?

47:53.904 --> 47:55.404
Can I play? Yeah?

47:59.209 --> 48:01.477
Hey, everybody, how
you doing, tonight?

48:01.479 --> 48:04.647
This next song goes out
to my new friend, Daisy.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.415

50:43.673 --> 50:46.008
Crash: Nice, man.
That was good.

50:46.010 --> 50:47.510
John: Thanks, thanks, thanks.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.544
Crash: Come on
down some time.

50:48.546 --> 50:49.745
(bartender claps slowly)

50:49.747 --> 50:51.080
All right, thank
you, thank you.

50:53.483 --> 50:55.151
-Hey, uh...
-That was really good.

50:55.153 --> 50:56.152
Let's get outta here.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.720
Huh? Wanna?

51:13.437 --> 51:16.405
(Daisy squeals)
Daisy: I'm starving!

51:20.377 --> 51:23.012
Daisy: Look at you, taking
me out to dinner, huh?

51:23.014 --> 51:25.081
John: It's the nicest
place in town, honey.

51:25.715 --> 51:26.849
Hey, kid!

51:26.851 --> 51:28.684
You got those pointy ends, yet?

51:30.287 --> 51:31.353
Nah, man.

51:31.355 --> 51:32.655
(John sighs)

51:33.290 --> 51:34.790
All right, here we go.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.292
Dinner, dinner, all right.

51:36.294 --> 51:37.893
What is this? Dinner here?

51:37.895 --> 51:38.994
Dinner.

51:39.296 --> 51:40.729
That baby, all right.

51:40.731 --> 51:43.132
Obviously we need this.
(plush pig oinks)

51:44.134 --> 51:45.401
How much?

51:45.403 --> 51:46.969
Well, the pig is seven...

51:47.404 --> 51:50.106
(Daisy sighs)
Don't mind him.

51:50.108 --> 51:51.607
He's just fucking with ya.

51:54.377 --> 51:55.945
Grab me that bottle of whiskey.

51:56.379 --> 51:58.714
-You heard the lady.
-Stop it.

52:00.417 --> 52:01.550
Thanks.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.385
You don't want your change?

52:03.920 --> 52:05.154
Keep it.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.261
Daisy: I'll take you to
my favorite spot.

52:12.263 --> 52:13.529
Turn here.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.098
(rock thuds against windshield)
(Daisy screams)

52:16.100 --> 52:17.299
John: Jeez. What the...

52:17.301 --> 52:19.468
(tires squeal)
(children laugh)

52:20.437 --> 52:21.570
Hey!

52:21.972 --> 52:23.472
-Hey, come back here!
-Daisy: Hey!

52:23.474 --> 52:25.608
-John: Hey, asshole patrol.
-Daisy: No.

52:25.610 --> 52:26.909
John: You come back
here, you little punks.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.244
Daisy: Easy there, cowboy.

52:28.246 --> 52:29.378
John: Hey!

52:30.080 --> 52:31.347
They dissed my car.

52:32.082 --> 52:34.183
Nothing a little wiper
fluid can't handle.

52:35.085 --> 52:37.486
They're just a couple
a kids out havin' fun.

52:37.488 --> 52:38.654
Yeah, but did you
see what they did

52:38.656 --> 52:40.089
to my little Sweet Sally?

52:40.290 --> 52:42.558
At least they're out
enjoying their childhood.

52:44.628 --> 52:46.195
This has given me a better idea.

52:46.197 --> 52:47.863
Woohoo!

52:47.865 --> 52:49.732
Yeah!
(laughs)

52:51.368 --> 52:54.537
(gunshots)

52:54.539 --> 52:55.671
Yeah!

52:56.806 --> 52:59.375
(gunshots)

53:00.143 --> 53:03.345
John: Driving
Miss Daisy, yeah!

53:05.348 --> 53:07.516
Daisy: Yeah, baby,
you know how to drive.

53:08.885 --> 53:10.085
Pull over!

53:11.221 --> 53:12.221
Come on.

53:12.223 --> 53:14.290
John: Hey, where you going?

53:14.991 --> 53:16.659
Hey. Where you...

53:16.661 --> 53:18.227
Daisy, where you going?

53:19.296 --> 53:20.362
Daisy: This way!

53:20.364 --> 53:21.864
John: Hey, I don't...

53:21.866 --> 53:23.098
I don't run.

53:26.670 --> 53:27.870
Fuck.

53:28.972 --> 53:30.406
(Bubba growls)

53:33.176 --> 53:34.276
Daisy?

53:34.544 --> 53:36.212
Daisy: Over here!

53:45.755 --> 53:47.122
Hold the Coke, right?

53:48.091 --> 53:50.826
John: Oh, I taught you well.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.129
I really had a
wonderful time, tonight.

53:55.932 --> 53:57.333
Yeah, me too.

54:00.370 --> 54:04.573
I don't usually let myself...

54:05.609 --> 54:07.643
Don't let yourself...?

54:09.512 --> 54:10.746
Nothing.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.283
Ah, so beautiful.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.519
I know, I love this place.

54:19.623 --> 54:21.257
Ever since I was a kid.

54:21.259 --> 54:23.659
Things would get too
intense, I'd run away.

54:24.427 --> 54:26.428
Never know exactly
where I was going, but,

54:26.930 --> 54:28.330
I'd always end up here.

54:29.299 --> 54:30.499
Always.

54:31.301 --> 54:32.368
Why's that?

54:34.204 --> 54:35.504
Just feels so peaceful.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.973
I felt safe.

54:39.476 --> 54:42.278
Safe? From what?

54:42.712 --> 54:46.382
Or maybe I just felt
like Princess Buttercup,

54:46.384 --> 54:49.285
and this is my fairytale world.

54:50.754 --> 54:54.223
Well, I guess
that would make me

54:55.825 --> 54:57.326
Andre the Giant.

54:57.761 --> 55:00.729
Oh, you brag!

55:01.798 --> 55:04.667
Look, I'm just going
off what they tell me.

55:05.068 --> 55:07.002
Then you should stop
talking to yourself.

55:07.004 --> 55:08.504
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

55:08.672 --> 55:12.041
It means my opinion is
the only one that matters.

55:12.442 --> 55:13.642
Oh, yeah?

55:14.177 --> 55:15.311
Yeah.

55:15.313 --> 55:16.478
- Yeah?
- Daisy: Yeah!

55:16.480 --> 55:18.113
John: Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

55:18.115 --> 55:20.249
(both grunt)

55:22.452 --> 55:23.452
Shit.

55:23.454 --> 55:25.688
(both grunt)

55:31.928 --> 55:33.228
Is that all you got?

55:34.264 --> 55:35.297
Want some of that?

55:35.299 --> 55:36.832
Andre the Giant?

55:37.434 --> 55:39.635
Or should I call
you Stuart Little?

55:39.637 --> 55:40.736
(John growls)

55:50.680 --> 55:55.351
(both moan)

55:59.522 --> 56:01.056
John: I love it, I love it.

56:04.227 --> 56:08.197
I can't. I can't, I gotta go.

56:08.199 --> 56:09.598
What time is it?

56:10.400 --> 56:11.834
Who cares what time it is?

56:11.836 --> 56:13.335
I have to go home.

56:13.337 --> 56:16.004
Aren't you a little
old for a curfew, honey?

56:16.006 --> 56:17.639
I mean...

56:17.641 --> 56:20.309
What, is your daddy gonna
spank you, or something?

56:20.311 --> 56:21.343
Fuck you!

56:21.345 --> 56:22.544
Whoa, easy.

56:23.246 --> 56:25.214
Relax, Daisy Do, I was...

56:25.216 --> 56:26.648
I was just joking.

56:27.550 --> 56:31.387
We're just kids out enjoying
our childhood, right?

56:32.822 --> 56:33.889
Right?

56:42.365 --> 56:43.732
Daisy: Thank you.

56:46.369 --> 56:47.803
Tonight was perfect.

56:48.438 --> 56:49.571
John: Yeah.

56:50.440 --> 56:52.608
Yeah, yeah.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.845
Daisy: But I gotta go, now.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.113
-John: No, no, wait...
-John, please.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.715
Listen, just, okay...

56:59.717 --> 57:00.883
Promise me you'll
see me tomorrow.

57:00.885 --> 57:01.884
Daisy: Let me go.

57:01.886 --> 57:02.985
Promise-- Wait!

57:03.219 --> 57:04.420
Promise me you will
see me tomorrow.

57:04.422 --> 57:06.255
All right, all right, I promise.

57:06.257 --> 57:07.923
Promise? Promise!

57:07.925 --> 57:10.426
You'll meet me tomorrow
at 10 am at the coffee shop.

57:10.428 --> 57:11.660
Downtown.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.696
I'll be the guy
that looks like me.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.168
All right?

57:19.536 --> 57:20.769
Daisy: Asshole.
(hand smacks)

57:21.404 --> 57:24.406
John: Jesus fucking...
(grunts)

57:24.408 --> 57:27.943
(John and Daisy grunt)

57:32.482 --> 57:33.549
Ah!

57:39.889 --> 57:42.958
Jeez.
(branch crunches)

57:42.960 --> 57:45.027
(Bubba growls)

57:47.397 --> 57:50.065
What the fuck?

57:57.774 --> 58:00.476
(door squeaks open)

58:06.082 --> 58:07.249
All right.

58:07.784 --> 58:10.252
Before you get upset,
I can explain.

58:10.854 --> 58:13.188
I know, I know, I
shoulda called, but...

58:14.858 --> 58:16.859
I lost track of time.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.028
(Bubba grumbles)

58:20.030 --> 58:22.831
Oh, my God, movie night.

58:22.833 --> 58:26.502
I completely forgot,
Bubba, I am so sorry.

58:26.504 --> 58:27.503
All right?

58:27.505 --> 58:29.004
We're really tired,

58:29.172 --> 58:31.106
let's just talk about

58:31.108 --> 58:32.674
(Bubba grumbles)

58:32.676 --> 58:35.577
Bubba! Okay, I'm sorry!

58:36.379 --> 58:38.514
You're acting just like Dad.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:04.760

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:05.861

come on get it.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.601

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:14.770

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.984
Let's go!

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:30.519
-John: To where?
-Right here.

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:31.620
Daisy: See that sign?

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.723
What? Oh, not a chance!

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.491
I've always wanted
to know my future.

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.959
Now, more than ever.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.795
Yeah, those psychics
are all the same, honey,

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:41.363
they tell you what
you already know,

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.998
and they pretend like they're
telling you something new.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.599
It's a waste of money, honey.

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:49.004
Ah, Jesus.
(engine revs)

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.405
Ah, God.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.611
Woman: Please, sit.

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.949
Put your tribute
in the jar, please.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.558
Shuffle them.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.761
When the cards begin
to resist, stop.

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.765
(cards flick)

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.409
Well, is it good?

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.144
Patience, Daisy.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.179
We'll see, soon enough.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.115
Did I tell you my name?

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:34.950
Woman: Sudden change.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:38.854
Unexpected, like a bolt
of lightning from the sky.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:42.924
Brought forth by
a man, a warrior.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.761
Strong, virile.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:50.332
One whose presence heralds
the arrival of love.

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:51.800
Desire.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.035
Lust.

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:58.707
An impassioned forging
of soul and flesh.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:01.943
Fucking psychic
mumbo jumbo bullshit.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.612
That's exactly what I need.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.884
That ultimately
results in demise.

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:10.886
Despair.

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:12.988
Darkness.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.027
That's it?

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.196
Woman: For now.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:22.998
What does it mean?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.399
If you'd like to know more,

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:27.435
a full life line reading
normally costs 50.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:31.239
-But today, for you, 40.
-Yeah, right.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.641
What a con.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.743
You got what you paid for.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.913
The cards never lie,
and neither do I.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.247
You'll see.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.349
I'm taking my damn money back.

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.753
Little girls with
big secrets should be

01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:47.455
very careful where
they put their hands.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:50.192
Very, very careful.

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.503
Freaky witch.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.207
John: Didn't go so good, huh?

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:21.189
You ever think about
hitting the road?

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.058
Seeing what's out there?

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.760
Used to.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.366
And why not now?

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.300
My...

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.573
-John: Your what?
-It's my brother.

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:41.109
He's got special needs.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.045
I don't think he'd
make it on his own.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:47.649
Must be hard.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.751
Taking care of your
brother all the time.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.653
The constant responsibility,

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.690
always have to put
yourself second, you know.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.125
Nobody comes second,

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.094
we take care of each other
equally, Bubba and me.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.663
Sounds nice.

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.465
What does?

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.469
Having someone

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:13.341
to look after
who looks after you.

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.845
Why, nobody's ever
looked after you, before?

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:20.615
No, no, not the right way.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.183
No.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.958
(Daisy sighs)

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.229
I mean, girl as gorgeous as you,

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.231
I'm sure you've got guys
running all over town

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:38.300
chasing you around
trying to catch you.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.637
Oh, they run, all right.

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.474
Away from me.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:48.343
(laughs)
I find that hard to believe.

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:50.545
Believe what you want.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.814
Okay, then I'll
believe that

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.350
you

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.386
are

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.623
the hottest

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.026
piece of ass I have

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:09.497
ever seen.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:10.999
Ever. Ever.

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:13.301
It's insane.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:15.804
Hey!

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:18.473
-That was a compliment.
-Keep it.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.911
John: What's so wrong with
telling an attractive woman

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.612
how attractive she is?

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.382
It's cheap, John, just
another pickup line at the bar.

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.918
I thought you were
better than that.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.219
Why? I mean...

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.522
Don't be so sensitive.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.992
Honestly.

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:40.929
If I wasn't pretty,
would you still be here?

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.732
Well?

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.234
Would you?

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.575
(laughs)

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:58.613
Ah!

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:01.850
Hey!

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:04.886
Hey.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.388
Hey!

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:18.967
Hey.

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.371
You know, I thought you were
different, but you're not.

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.808
You're just another tool
looking for a quick fix.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.510
Hey, I don't
know what's got you

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:29.711
so fucked up in your head, okay?

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:30.879
But I was just being honest.

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:32.647
That's all, all right?

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.315
Don't take it so personal.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.419
I didn't mean to hurt your...

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.787
Your feelings, all right?

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.288
Well, you did.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.592
Well then I'm...

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.332
I'm sorry.

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.239
That's a start.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.844
This is hard, you know?

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:13.021
(breathes shakily)

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.260
All right.

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.596
Let's uh...

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.399
-Daisy: Let's walk it off.
-John: Yeah, yeah.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:27.335
John: Let's just
pretend that you're...

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:33.108
you're really fat
and really ugly,

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.778
and smell like a
barnyard animal.

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:41.015
Then what would you
do, Mister Shallow?

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:09.644
(John moans and pants)

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.981
John: Oh, God.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.676
You like it?

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.915
I love it.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.288
Oh, fuck.

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:59.360
(John moans)

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.139
Daisy: What are you doing?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.507
John: I'm showing
you how much I...

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:13.474
-Daisy: Stop it.
-John: Love you.

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:17.745
I said stop, motherfucker!

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.280
John: Oh! Ah!

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.485
What?

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:30.892
You're a fucking,
you're a cherry, I...

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.963
I had no idea, I'm sorry.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.099
You ain't never been
popped yet, I get that.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.434
It's cute. Oh!

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:41.903
Fuck you!
(John groans)

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:45.273
Hey!

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.542
(sobs)

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:34.989
(car horn honks)

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.224
Frye: Come on, come on!

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.331
Where are you...
Where you going, John?

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:44.499
Hello?

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.660
Daisy: Dinner time.

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:21.903
(Daisy yells)

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.550
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:36.751
I didn't see you!

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.386
Texting and driving
like an idiot.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:39.787
No worries.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.556
You know, for a minute there

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.557
I thought you were
trying to kill me?

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.459
(laughs)

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.260
Oh, I got that, I'll
give you a hand.

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.764
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.733
I like the sound of that.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.735
Whoo!

01:12:56.372 --> 01:13:01.442
Oh, you little tatted
hussy tramp.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.850
Thank you for the ride.

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.251
Been walking all day.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:15.423
Not a problem.
Where you headed?

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.392
Next town over.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.826
I know it well.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:21.095
Oh, man, perfect!

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.431
If you don't mind giving me
a ride that way, that is.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.433
Don't mind at all.

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:28.236
Just have to stop at home
real quick, if that's okay.

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.303
It's on the way.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.705
Hey, no hurries here.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.240
You do what you gotta do.

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.275
I'm just grateful for a ride.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.778
My feet are killing me.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.624
(gate clangs)

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.560
Daisy: This is my
place, right here.

01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:54.295
Just take a couple minutes.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:57.331
You know, uh, I don't
have to be anywhere.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:00.134
I'll keep that in mind.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.171
Be right back.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.446
Damn, she's smokin'.

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.027
(hawk screeches)

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.766
Daisy: Let go, Bubba!

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:34.068
I'm in no mood
for your attitude.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.703
(Bubba's hand smacks table)

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.640
This...
(plush pig oinks)

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.210
You want to know what this is?

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.980
This is fucking shit,
that's what this is.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.648
Fucking shit!

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.351
Now you better get
your ass in gear

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:51.719
if you want to eat.

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.890
I just went shoppin'.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.861
Grease him up for me, baby.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:04.632
(Bubba grunts)
(machete emits metallic tone)

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:06.100
(Bubba laughs)

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.175
Looks like it's
your lucky day, Paul.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.409
Lucky day.

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.283
(Bubba growls)

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.119
(Bubba laughs)

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.189
What the hell, man?

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.491
Shit, really, sir?

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:31.826
Ow!

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.094
Fuck, please, I
didn't do anything!

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.763
Please, sir, wait, I
didn't do anything!

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:45.306
(Paul pants)
(footsteps approach rapidly)

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:46.908
(Daisy laughs)

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.910
You greased that little
piggy up for me real good,

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:50.177
didn't you, Bubba?

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:54.081
(knife clangs against post)
Yeehaw!

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.217
(Daisy yells battle cry)

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.153
Holy shit.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:07.061
Come on, Bubba! Whoo!

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.798
(Bubba grunts)

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.868
Big boy, Jesus.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:18.940
<i>♪ I am a taxi driver</i>

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:24.845
♪ I roam the streets at night

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:32.119

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.830

(Paul grunts)

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:20.768
<i>♪ The passion</i>

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.036
Crazy bitch!

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:28.476
I'm sorry, but I
got a brother to feed.

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:31.979
(Paul yells)

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:41.889
Aren't you full of surprises?

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:45.326
(Paul screams)

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.696
Yeehaw!

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.042
Bubba!

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.012
I got him!

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:12.620
I sure do like that belt.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.062
Bubba, you gotta carry him home!

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:23.431
(Bubba mumbles)

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:37.745
(meat squishes)

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:51.592
Now this is a fine piece

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:56.997
of fashion, don't
you think, Bubba?

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:59.266
I think I could get
used to this one.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.671
Bubba?

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.308
You know I love you.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.811
I'm sorry I haven't
been myself, lately.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:12.413
It's a...

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.415
A girl thing.

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.191
(Daisy moans)

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.093
This blood's so sweet.

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:36.303
(both laugh)

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:39.273
All right, I'm gonna go dance
around the yard in this, now.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.064
(phone rings)

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:08.302
Pines Motel, this is
Charlie, can I help you?

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.077
Uh, yeah, seems to
be checking out.

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.255
John Doe?

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.158
(wheelchair motor whines)
Hey, excuse me, hey.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.060
Hello?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.564
Excuse me, sir,
checking out today?

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:39.366
No.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.538
-But, uh, you are.
-What?

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.941
No. Hey, what are you doing?

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.209
-Put me down!
-John: Hut!

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:49.710
-Charlie: Put me down!
-John: Hut!

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:51.745
John: Hike!
(Charlie thuds in trunk)

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.949
Charlie: What are you doing?
Don't do this.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.751
Get me out of here!

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.820
Rest easy, you little fuck.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:02.790
Charlie: No!
(banging emanates from trunk)

01:21:02.792 --> 01:21:07.528
(Charlie's muffled yells
emanate from trunk)

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.597
Charlie: Somebody
get me out of here!

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.066
-Help!
-John: Oh, yeah!

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:16.036
-John: Shut up!
-Charlie: You can't do this!

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.273
(engine dies)

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.280
Charlie! Charlie!
(bell rings)

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:41.495
Daisy: Get the movie,
I'll be right back!

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.272
(engine starts)

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:12.126
(Bubba gasps)

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.130
Hey, big fella.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:20.301
I brought you a
little fresh meat.

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:24.371
There we go.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.208
Hey, hey whoa, relax.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.477
I come in peace, my name's
John, I'm a friend of Daisy's.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:33.247
(Bubba grunts angrily)
Good friend, actually.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.616
Maybe she mentioned me?
Maybe not.

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:39.553
(laughs)
Big guy. Okay.

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:42.222
Hey, I think we're getting
off on the wrong foot, here.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:44.959
You know, Daisy tells me
you're an amazing chef,

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.794
and I, uh...

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:48.996
If that's true, then that's
another thing we got in common,

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:51.265
because I love, gotta tell ya,

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:53.701
I love some baby back ribs.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.303
(Charlie cries out)
(John yells)

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.408
And if that's true, in fact,

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.010
then I think you
know, maybe you could

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:05.512
teach me a culinary
thing, or two, you know?

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:09.350
Like, what I would
do with this big

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:12.286
motherfucking pan!
(John yells)

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:15.389
(pot clangs)

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.702
Hm, why not?

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.206
You fat fucker.

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.376
Oh, you guys,

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.678
you guys are little fuck
buddies, aren't you?

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:42.182
There we go.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.450
Don't eat this.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:45.886
Bubba, I'm telling you, man,

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.554
you gotta go on a fucking diet.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:49.189
You would've eaten him!

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:51.925
Little fucker.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.029
Rest easy, Charlie.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.249
(Frye clears throat)

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.589
How you doing,
Detective Handsome?

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.058
It's Margo, right?

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.326
You remember!
(Frye laughs)

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:27.928
Hey, did you hear
about the murder?

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.596
I did.

01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:31.198
I didn't know her personally,

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.067
but she came in here
every once in awhile.

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:34.601
Seemed nice.

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:36.537
What's up with that
hairdo, though?

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:38.005
I know, right?

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.908
I heard she was stabbed
like a gazillion times.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.043
Do you know who did it?

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:44.578
No, who?

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.746
Well, there was a...

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.549
You're fucking
with me, Detective.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.517
(Frye laughs)
I am, just a little bit.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.954
-Frye: Is Walt working tonight?
-No.

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:55.422
Why, you think he did it?

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.357
What about Daisy?

01:24:58.226 --> 01:24:59.626
They don't work on Sundays.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:02.463
Walt always gives 'em
the same days off.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.431
Because he has a crush on her.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.766
Ooh.

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:07.201
Would you happen to
know where she lives?

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.803
No.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.339
-No one does, not even Walt.
-Frye: Hm.

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:15.109
She's real private
about that kinda thing.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:18.145
I heard her daddy left
her a bunch of land

01:25:18.147 --> 01:25:20.414
somewhere out in the
middle of nowhere.

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:23.650
Supposedly, she commutes
30 minutes each way.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:24.818
Frye: Hm.

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:28.789
So, no idea at all?

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.291
Nope.

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:33.494
(gasps)
Why?

01:25:33.496 --> 01:25:34.828
Do you think she did it?

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.867
Thanks, Margo, gotta go.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.992
(engine starts)

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.263
Daisy? Is that you?

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:47.000
Hey, Daisy, my name
is Detective Frye.

01:26:47.002 --> 01:26:49.069
I need to speak with
you about John Doe.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.804
What about him?

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:52.105
I think you may be in danger.

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.474
Daisy.

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:56.944
(crossbow clicks)

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:02.583
Daisy: Oh, fuck.
(Frye gurgles on blood)

01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:04.651
I'm sorry about that.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:08.088
But you shouldn't be
trespassing on private property!

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:10.624
(Daisy sighs)
Here's the deal.

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:12.893
Now this arrow's gone
and found its way

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:14.895
straight through your jugular.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:16.163
You're gonna bleed out

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.497
and there's nothing
we can do about that,

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:19.066
you understand me?

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:21.168
Now, I don't know what you got
against our boy John, here,

01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:24.471
but I can tell you he's
on my shit list, too.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.740
But right now,
(Frye gurgles blood)

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.242
it's movie night.

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:31.078
So we're gonna have to deal
with you in the mornin'.

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:11.218
(Daisy whistles short tune)

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:15.889
Bubba?

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:18.792
(John grunts,
imitating Bubba)

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.732
Surprise, surprise!

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.670
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:32.906
Uh, aren't you glad to see me?

01:28:32.908 --> 01:28:34.675
How do you know where I live?

01:28:34.677 --> 01:28:36.576
And who let you inside?

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.780
Where's my brother? Where's--

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:41.982
I gave him the night off.

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:46.753
Daisy: That is
not funny, John.

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:48.588
Where the hell is Bubba?

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.826
Just relax, relax, okay?

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.995
I was just joking.

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:57.097
He's out back in the work shed.

01:28:57.099 --> 01:28:58.365
I brought him a little person...

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.700
Present!

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.069
I brought him a little present.

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:05.005
Just calm down, all right?

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:07.074
I thought

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:10.510
this was more
appropriate than whiskey?

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:14.548
I'll take that.

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.383
Okay.

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:18.518
All right.

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.455
Here we go.
(glasses clink)

01:29:21.457 --> 01:29:22.589
Cheers.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:29.529
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.098
You know, I gotta say,

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:35.001
Bubba was a pretty
hard sell, at first.

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:37.471
He's very protective of you.

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.240
But, then when I told him

01:29:40.242 --> 01:29:42.576
that you meant the world to me,

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:46.246
and I would never do
anything to hurt him, or you,

01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:49.649
and one day we
could be brothers,

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.219
I guess you could say that's
when he spared my life.

01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:53.253
Really?

01:29:53.255 --> 01:29:55.822
Really. Really.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.558
And I mean, besides,
look at me, right?

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.494
I mean, I'm no match for Bubba.

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:03.230
He's got me by like 500 pounds!

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:04.798
-That's true.
-John: Right?

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.333
But still...

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.503
Still what?

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:11.338
Hey.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:16.143
Come here, come here.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:19.946
It's beautiful.

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:21.081
Yeah.

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.683
Here, have a seat, have a seat.

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:28.588
You know, Bubba
helped me so much.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.757
I could not have done
this without him.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.996
I mean, I've been slaving
over a hot stove all day,

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:37.497
Daisy Do.

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.138
(John sighs)

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.308
And listen.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.179
This is my way of apologizing.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:56.783
I was a real jerk today,
and I'm sorry.

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:00.554
Yours.

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:04.691
And mine.

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:07.194
All right.

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:09.996
Okay.

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:18.839
Oh. Ladies first.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:21.975
Ooh!

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:25.545
Daisy: Mm.

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:27.814
Like it?

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:29.850
Mm-hm.

01:31:29.852 --> 01:31:31.518
You prefer it rare, right?

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.887
Oh, yeah.

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.160
Oh, you don't like it, do you?

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:42.095
Yes, I do.

01:31:42.097 --> 01:31:43.196
No, it's all right.

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:46.099
You don't like it, I can tell.

01:31:46.101 --> 01:31:48.034
-Here, I'll--
-I do, John.

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:50.203
Daisy: It's just...

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.608
Guys never made
me dinner, before.

01:31:57.044 --> 01:32:00.881
Usually I make them dinner.
(both laugh)

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:01.948
Yeah.

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.684
This is a first for me.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.854
You're the first, for me.

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.223
Same here.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:12.893
And...

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:17.264
And to think that you're
almost the girl that got away?

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.800
I don't think I coulda
lived with that.

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.236
Really?

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:24.971
Really.

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:26.873
I've never met anybody like you.

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:30.844
You know, I mean,
we're so much alike

01:32:30.846 --> 01:32:33.079
it's downright scary.

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:36.049
What do you mean, "alike"?

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.552
Our

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:43.390
individual peculiarities.

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:47.060
Our particular appetites.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.463
What are you talking about?

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:55.101
You know, your little
fetish, running around,

01:32:55.103 --> 01:32:56.937
chasing the guys
around the woods.

01:32:57.872 --> 01:33:02.242
I'm curious, is it the hunt?

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.744
The kill?

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:09.082
Or eating them
afterwards that gets you?

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:14.154
You know, because for me...

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:19.659
For me it's...

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:24.564
It's not fucking every
woman that I'm with.

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:29.069
It's killing them afterwards.

01:33:29.071 --> 01:33:32.038
Slow, painful-like.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.075
You know, I like to see that
last moment of their life

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:38.979
just seep away from
their desecrated bodies.

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.648
But I digress.

01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:45.552
I mean, that's me,
I like to kill.

01:33:45.554 --> 01:33:49.089
But you like to eat
them afterwards.

01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:53.026
And you know, I'm not
judging, I'm just saying.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:56.963
But eat up, darlin',

01:33:56.965 --> 01:33:59.132
there's lots more
where that came from.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.367
Lots more.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.208
I know this is a lot to digest.

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:13.480
You sick fuck!

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.215
Me?

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.917
I'm the sick fuck?

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.221
I'm the sick fuck?

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:25.158
The cannibal girl next door's
calling me a sick fuck?

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.060
I mean, you just ate
your own fucking brother!

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:35.402
(Daisy breathes shakily)

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.074
Bubba?

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:43.276
I'm afraid so.

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:46.680
Uh-huh.
Oh!

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.116
(Daisy retches)

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:52.952
Yeah. Oh, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba.

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:54.788
And he did turn out
pretty damn tasty,

01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:57.190
if I do say so, myself.

01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:59.693
(Daisy retches)
Let me hold your hair back.

01:34:59.695 --> 01:35:00.560
Oh.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.266
Oh, get it out.

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.070
That's better.

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:13.139
That's better, honey.
(Daisy breathes heavily)

01:35:13.141 --> 01:35:14.340
Okay?

01:35:14.342 --> 01:35:17.043
You bastard!
(John grunts)

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.112
(Daisy cries out in pain)

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.651
(Daisy coughs)

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.722
All right, well save
your energy, honey,

01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:30.490
'cause we're just
getting started.

01:35:30.492 --> 01:35:31.958
(John grunts)
(foot impacts Daisy's stomach)

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:43.803
(John grunts)
(Daisy cries out)

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:06.693
(John plays the guitar lightly)

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:18.438
Why are you doing this to me?

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:23.777
Because I thought
you were different.

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:28.615
I thought you were the one.

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:33.653
But it turns out that...

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:37.857
You're just like everyone else.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.293
Dirty.

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.729
Filthy.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:48.067
What are you talking about?

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:50.937
Who do you think you are,

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:53.506
desecrating a beautiful
gift from God, like that?

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:56.442
What do you mean?

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:57.744
You know what
I'm talking about!

01:36:58.112 --> 01:36:59.145
That god damn, fucking
tattoo on your other side.

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.847
I can't even fucking look at it.

01:37:00.849 --> 01:37:02.582
It's driving me fucking crazy.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.519
What were you thinking?

01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:08.021
Please, John.

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.190
I'll do whatever you want.

01:37:10.192 --> 01:37:12.559
I'll get the tattoo removed!

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:20.767
It's too late.

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.103
What's done is done.

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.409
And besides,

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:33.346
do you know what
tattoos lead to?

01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:40.386
Tattoos lead to more tattoos.

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:44.424
And I can't allow that.

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:47.727
(Daisy sobs)

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:50.430
Please.

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:52.365
Don't...

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:54.734
Don't kill me.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.136
Oh, don't worry, Daisy Do.

01:37:57.138 --> 01:37:59.072
I'm not gonna kill
ya any time soon.

01:37:59.074 --> 01:38:02.575
After all, I'm a gentleman.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.912
And god damn it, I
believe in foreplay.

01:38:05.914 --> 01:38:06.980
(Daisy sobs)

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.388

(Daisy sobs)

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.418
(Daisy cries out)

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:05.098
I loved you so much.

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:13.106
(John yells)
(Daisy screams)

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:18.511
(Bubba mumbles)
Charlie: You're alive!

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:23.182
(Daisy wails)
(Bubba grumbles in agitation)

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:28.021
Bubba, look at me. Calm down.

01:40:28.023 --> 01:40:29.889
(Daisy screams)
(Bubba angrily grumbles)

01:40:29.891 --> 01:40:32.425
Look, I got stabbed in the
back, for crying out loud.

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.561
I'm no match for John Doe.

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:36.929
I need you, Bubba.

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.599
But Daisy needs you more.

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:42.168
Bubba, you can do it.

01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:43.469
Break those chains, come on!

01:40:43.471 --> 01:40:45.004
Come on, break them.

01:40:45.006 --> 01:40:47.807
Break those chains!
(Daisy cries out)

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:04.624
Please.

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:08.628
John.

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:14.467
Find it in your
heart to forgive me.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:35.688
What are you doing?

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:41.461
(Daisy gasps)
I absolve you.

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:45.031
(John grunts)
(Daisy chokes)

01:41:45.033 --> 01:41:47.233
(chains rattle)
Rip his head off!

01:41:47.235 --> 01:41:48.534
Come on, get him!

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.303
Rip it off!

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:54.574
Rest easy, Mister Doe.

01:41:54.576 --> 01:41:57.443
(Charlie laughs wickedly)

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:01.080
I always do.

01:42:01.082 --> 01:42:02.815
(Charlie chuckles)

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:09.288
Bye!
(Bubba growls)

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:14.794
Hike!

01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:16.129
Get me out of here!

01:42:16.131 --> 01:42:17.563
John: Little fucker.

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:21.767
Charlie: Hey, let me
out, you can't do this.

01:42:21.769 --> 01:42:23.169
John: Oh, is it?
Charlie: What are you doing?

01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:24.270
John: My first choice.
Charlie: Hey!

01:42:24.272 --> 01:42:25.671
Charlie: Get me out of here!

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:26.973
John: Is it the wrong one?

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:30.343
(John yells)

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:36.382
-Charlie: Somebody help me!
-John: Fuck!

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:41.087
Voiceover: Oh, hello.

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:43.256
You're supposed
to say, "arrow"!

01:42:43.258 --> 01:42:44.624
Voiceover: I'm sorry.

01:42:44.626 --> 01:42:47.093
Charlie: Hey!
Get me out of here!

01:42:55.169 --> 01:42:56.969
Somebody please help me!

01:42:56.971 --> 01:42:59.038
Fucking someone
help me out, please.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.573
I mean Jesus.
(Charlie yells in trunk)

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:07.780
All right, so let's just
pretend that you're a...

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:12.885
300 pound hermaphrodite

01:43:12.887 --> 01:43:15.621
with a small, little weird penis

01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:17.723
and a vagina, too?

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.158
Voiceover: For
crying out loud,

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.693
somebody get a damn locksmith?

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:21.761
'Cause on the same days off,

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:23.796
'cause he has a crush on her.

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:31.404
I fucked that up, didn't I?

01:43:31.406 --> 01:43:33.005
It might' a been me fucking up.

01:43:33.007 --> 01:43:34.707
-I think I fucked it up.
-I don't know.

01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:35.875
Why don't we start over?

01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:37.076
-Great.
-Sounds good.

01:43:37.078 --> 01:43:38.578
(both laugh)

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:41.814
I'm like so, over dead by now.

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.817
John: Boob, side boob! Ah!

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:51.624
I need you, Bubba.

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.962
Daisy needs you more.

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:58.731

Break those chains!

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:12.912
We just have one.

01:44:16.116 --> 01:44:17.283
Oh, sorry.

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:18.484
