Why is there hair everywhere?
Did you shave in the kitchen?

00:07.674 --> 00:09.843
The water in here is softer.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.640
Look at this ski-jumping idiot, Bode Miller.
What kind of a fruity name is Bode?

00:14.806 --> 00:17.601
That cereal has the Olympics on it?
It must be eight months old.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.602
When you and me have kids,

00:18.769 --> 00:20.938
we're gonna give them good names,
like Shannon or Rick.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.314
When we what?

00:22.481 --> 00:26.527
When we have kids,
dummy. Come on.

00:28.828 --> 00:31.650
Yeah, I gotta go. Uh...

00:31.820 --> 00:34.035
Are you gonna be home later?
I gotta talk to you about something.

00:34.205 --> 00:35.369
I'll be right here.

00:35.538 --> 00:36.628
Look at this maze. It's so easy.

00:36.789 --> 00:38.452
You have to go in here,
and out there.

00:38.626 --> 00:39.792
Be home early, okay?

00:39.956 --> 00:40.793
Come here, sweetheart.

00:40.956 --> 00:42.912
Oh, Dennis.
I just did my hair.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.920
Oh, that's my girl.

00:45.086 --> 00:48.172
There you go.
Bye.

00:49.718 --> 00:53.052
Now make sure you drink plenty of fluids,
and get something to eat.

00:53.226 --> 00:57.223
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
Don't hit the clubs.

00:57.395 --> 01:00.353
No, I'm going straight home, actually.
I'm breaking up with my boyfriend tonight.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.852
I can't take it anymore.

01:02.028 --> 01:04.769
Hmm, 35, single,
no children.

01:04.947 --> 01:08.020
Three sexual partners
in the last ten years.

01:08.198 --> 01:12.823
I don't know, doll.
Maybe it's time to settle.

01:12.998 --> 01:16.950
Chocolate chip,
or butter crunch?

01:17.788 --> 01:19.243
(Jenna) I can't believe
that this is happening to me.

01:19.418 --> 01:20.532
It's just not fair.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.331
(Pete) You're right.
This business is unfair.

01:23.506 --> 01:24.410
What happened?

01:24.588 --> 01:26.212
Jenna was supposed to be
on the Conan show tonight, but...

01:26.375 --> 01:27.582
I got bumped.

01:27.758 --> 01:30.171
Oh, you know,
that kind of thing happens.

01:30.346 --> 01:32.923
Jack bumped her
and put Tracy on instead.

01:33.096 --> 01:35.340
Jenna, you can't let this
kind of thing get to you.

01:35.517 --> 01:38.841
I just feel like everything
always gets taken away from me.

01:39.018 --> 01:41.513
No, that's not true.
What about that movie you did last summer?

01:41.687 --> 01:43.103
"The Rural Juror"?

01:43.275 --> 01:45.891
Yeah, The Rur--
That one.

01:46.065 --> 01:51.442
Rural Juror, apple three, take one. Mark!
A terrible title. Action!

01:51.615 --> 01:52.653
When does that come out?

01:52.825 --> 01:56.450
"The Rural Juror" opens in
selected theaters December 18th.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.321
Does Jack Donaghy even know
I'm in The Rural Juror?

01:59.497 --> 02:02.740
Maybe if he knew I have a film career,
he would treat me with more respect.

02:02.915 --> 02:03.793
/Jenna to the set, please.

02:03.958 --> 02:07.411
/Jenna to the set for
/Rodney Stink Confirmed Bachelor.

02:07.588 --> 02:08.251
I will tell him.

02:08.425 --> 02:14.381
I will tell him that you are
in a feature film called The Rrr Jrr.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.470
What the hell's her movie called?

02:19.648 --> 02:20.013
I don't know.

02:20.185 --> 02:21.473
She's been talking
about it for a year.

02:21.645 --> 02:22.890
I can't ask her now.

02:23.065 --> 02:24.933
I can't believe Jack did this to her.

02:25.107 --> 02:27.141
I can't believe Conan's gonna have
Tracy on as a guest again,

02:27.316 --> 02:28.770
considering what happened
the last time.

02:28.946 --> 02:30.101
You seem like you have
a nice chemistry...

02:30.275 --> 02:32.863
I am a stabbing robot.
I will stab you.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.570
Oh, jeez. All right, no, okay.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.322
All right, all right.
That's great, Tracy.

02:36.498 --> 02:38.701
We'll take a break.
We'll be right back.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.953
Hey, Clariss,
can I see Josh's Stone Phillips wig?

02:42.128 --> 02:42.571
Oh, great.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.203
Do you mind if
I pop it on you, actually?

02:44.377 --> 02:45.411
I want to see the shape of it.

02:45.588 --> 02:48.120
Please, it would make
my wife's dream come true.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.830
Oh. Yeah?

02:51.426 --> 02:51.712
Handsome?

02:51.886 --> 02:52.382
Yes.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.211
- You find me handsome?
- Yes, very much.

02:54.386 --> 02:57.923
You know,
I used to be very rich.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.302
Hello.

02:59.475 --> 03:01.223
Oh, hi. Sorry.

03:01.397 --> 03:04.723
I know you're wearing that as a joke,
but it makes you look younger,

03:04.898 --> 03:09.232
and more confident,
and I think you should consider it.

03:09.395 --> 03:10.561
Can I see you in my office?

03:10.738 --> 03:13.362
Yeah, hang on a second, actually.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.320
Why did you bump Jenna from Conan?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.903
Because if I have a choice
between an international movie star,

03:18.076 --> 03:19.702
and a woman who does
commercials for ShopRite--

03:19.865 --> 03:20.202
No, no, no.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.240
Jenna doesn't do those commercials anymore.
She got fired.

03:23.418 --> 03:26.121
I don't do these things
just to drive you crazy, Lemon.

03:26.296 --> 03:28.160
I do them for
the good of the show.

03:28.336 --> 03:31.423
I'm the one that always has to
clean up the mess afterwards.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.963
That's why my job is
way better than yours.

03:34.137 --> 03:36.843
/Way better.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.697 --> 04:01.490
Conan.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.411
Tracy's really excited
to be back on your show.

04:04.576 --> 04:05.160
I don't know, Jack.

04:05.325 --> 04:07.703
He's kind of a loose cannon,
and I like to surround myself

04:07.875 --> 04:09.452
with people that
don't try to stab me.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.961
Tracy's feeling a lot better now.
He's under a doctor's care.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.923
That's what they said about Hasselhoff,
then he tried to make out with me
during a commercial break.

04:16.084 --> 04:18.051
Conan, this is important to me. 

04:18.214 --> 04:20.921
So we can either do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

04:21.098 --> 04:22.089
What's the hard way?

04:22.266 --> 04:27.350
You do a live Christmas Eve special
from Kabul every year until
the war on terror is won.

04:27.518 --> 04:32.023
Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight.
You, black Irish bastard.

04:32.187 --> 04:34.310
Back at you, man.

04:34.486 --> 04:37.060
I have to be charming on Conan tonight.

04:37.238 --> 04:40.032
This is my chance to redeem myself
with mainstream America.

04:40.195 --> 04:44.570
Okay, well just tell us some things about your life,
and we'll try to punch it up and make it talk show-worthy.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.160
Maybe something about you and your wife.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.163
Me  and my wife like to play "rape."
She go in the bathroom and do her hair.

04:49.335 --> 04:50.662
- Then I put on a ski mask...
- Okay, not that.

04:50.838 --> 04:53.832
Hey, uh, you got anything
about being a dad?

04:54.106 --> 04:55.371
People eat that garbage up.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.383
I like to walk around my house naked,
to remind my oldest son

04:58.545 --> 04:59.883
who's still got
the biggest ding dong.

05:00.055 --> 05:01.133
No.

05:01.307 --> 05:03.133
I can tell the story
of how I met Sharon Stone.

05:03.306 --> 05:04.051
Oh, what was that?

05:04.225 --> 05:06.263
I was pooping in the ladies' room
at the Ivy...

05:06.435 --> 05:08.600
No.

05:11.015 --> 05:12.643
My hair hurts.

05:12.817 --> 05:14.181
Anybody gonna answer the phone?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.232
What phone?

05:15.398 --> 05:18.441
Is anybody gonna
answer the phone? The phone!

05:18.615 --> 05:22.113
It's ringing!
Ring! Ring!

05:22.407 --> 05:23.862
So you wanted to see me?

05:24.035 --> 05:24.993
Oh, Lemon, wonderful.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.952
I'm introducing Jack Welch
with a dinner at the Waldorf.

05:28.126 --> 05:30.451
What's a funny little quip
I could open with?

05:30.627 --> 05:32.333
That's why you called me up here?

05:32.498 --> 05:33.160
Okay.

05:33.335 --> 05:34.713
Uh... "Good evening.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.620
It's great to be here
at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria.

05:37.796 --> 05:41.963
"I haven't seen this many
white people in tuxedoes since the Titanic."

05:42.137 --> 05:46.803
Lemon, this is not open mike night
at the Bryn Mawr student union.

05:46.977 --> 05:49.471
This is a $1,000
a plate fund raiser.

05:49.645 --> 05:51.760
Okay, uh...
How about,

05:51.937 --> 05:53.972
"Wow, $1,000 a plate.

05:54.147 --> 05:58.483
"For that kind of money this stuffed
chicken breast better paint my house."

05:58.657 --> 06:01.611
Let me tell you what
I was thinking of saying.

06:01.776 --> 06:06.150
"Jack Welch has such unparalleled management skills,
they named Welch's grape juice after him.

06:06.325 --> 06:10.491
"Because he squeezes the sweetest juice
out of his workers' mind grapes."

06:10.666 --> 06:11.912
That doesn't even make sense.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.541
No, it doesn't, does it?
I wrote it down in the middle of the night.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.790
Listen, I'll try to come up with something for you,
but I gotta get back downstairs.

06:17.968 --> 06:20.252
Lizzie  needs help.

06:20.428 --> 06:22.250
Cookie in the middle of the day?

06:22.428 --> 06:23.880
I gave blood.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.765
Does that burn calories?

06:26.925 --> 06:27.729
What else?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.898
What else is on my mind grapes?

06:31.059 --> 06:35.312
I could talk about how the moon is a spy satellite
put there by Oprah and minister Farrakhan.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.692
And not the minister
Farrakhan you're thinking of.

06:39.855 --> 06:42.153
Who's that dude?

06:42.316 --> 06:44.860
Uh, what dude?

06:45.037 --> 06:49.403
The blue dude.
Tell him to stop staring at me.

06:49.578 --> 06:54.410
I don't like that dude.
I don't like that dude.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.832
Meep.

07:01.176 --> 07:03.212
Hey, guys.

07:03.386 --> 07:04.551
That was weird.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.132
Hi.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.923
You missed it.
Tracy was acting old-school bananas.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.013
He's always bananas.

07:09.175 --> 07:10.431
No, this was different.

07:10.595 --> 07:12.640
Yeah. Like Conan-should-be-afraid different.

07:12.805 --> 07:16.223
Really?
Where did he go?

07:16.646 --> 07:20.520
Yes. I am having problems
with my cable television.

07:20.696 --> 07:23.692
Yes, I will hold.

07:25.025 --> 07:30.451
Excuse me, I have another call.
Hi, mom. I am doing fine.

07:31.285 --> 07:35.411
Oh, that's not good.
Frank, that was my blood cookie.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.123
Ew, what?

07:40.376 --> 07:42.253
Hey, Jack Attack.

07:42.427 --> 07:45.753
Sorry, I should have kept
that one in the old brain box.

07:45.926 --> 07:47.632
Could you sign that for me, please?

07:47.805 --> 07:50.381
Pete, where is your charisma?

07:50.556 --> 07:52.092
What?

07:52.266 --> 07:53.221
The wig.

07:53.395 --> 07:55.392
I prefer that you wear it.

07:55.556 --> 07:57.142
Well, I thought you were joking.

07:57.316 --> 07:59.682
Well, let me clarify:
I'm not joking.

07:59.857 --> 08:03.021
Pete, did you know
that men with full heads of hair

08:03.198 --> 08:06.730
on average earn 17% more
than their bald counterparts?

08:06.907 --> 08:07.902
I did not know that.

08:08.075 --> 08:10.153
Perhaps it's because
bald men are generally less informed

08:10.327 --> 08:11.153
than men with full heads of hair.

08:11.326 --> 08:15.201
But here's what I want you to do.
Wear the wig for a week.

08:15.377 --> 08:17.083
And experience your full potential.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.332
I think this is my full potential.

08:19.496 --> 08:21.003
I know you're skeptical,
Pete, I know.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.713
Here, I want you to do something.
Pull my hair.

08:24.886 --> 08:27.883
Right now, go ahead.
Pull my hair.

08:28.055 --> 08:31.723
I'm just kidding.
It's real.

08:32.975 --> 08:35.552
I'm not like you.

08:35.726 --> 08:36.802
So, be honest with me.
What did Jack say?

08:36.977 --> 08:40.102
I guess he thinks
that Tracy is a movie star.

08:40.275 --> 08:43.522
And he doesn't love it
that you did those commercials.

08:43.698 --> 08:47.733
Well, you tell him that those commercials
paid for my vacation home.

08:47.907 --> 08:50.442
So, unless he would like to buy me
a condo in Clearwater, Florida...

08:50.616 --> 08:52.690
Jenna, I'm sorry.
Just let it go.

08:52.868 --> 08:54.911
Tracy's doing Conan tonight.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.743
Liz Lemon, we got a problem.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.751
Grizz and Dotcom say Tracy's doctor
put him on some new medication.

09:07.926 --> 09:09.462
I guess he's having
some sort of reaction.

09:09.637 --> 09:10.552
Boy, Conan tapes in...

09:10.716 --> 09:11.552
Less than two hours.

09:11.716 --> 09:15.092
Call me if you need me.

09:17.896 --> 09:21.103
Tray? Can I come in?

09:25.776 --> 09:28.902
I'm bugging out!
I'm bugging out.

09:29.065 --> 09:32.033
I'm bugging out!

09:35.288 --> 09:36.240
Tracy!

09:36.417 --> 09:36.990
Who is your doctor?

09:37.165 --> 09:39.582
Dr. Spaceman!
Dr. Spaceman!

09:39.746 --> 09:42.040
Oh, brother. Look around.
We have to find his medication.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.832
Dr. Spaceman.
Dr. Spaceman.

09:47.008 --> 09:51.750
Wow, Dr. Spaceman.
I owe you an apology, Tray.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.133
This is Dr. Leo Spa-che-men.

09:55.305 --> 09:56.931
Hi,  I work with Tracy Jordan,
and I think he's having

09:57.097 --> 09:59.262
a reaction to some of
the medication you put him on.

09:59.436 --> 10:01.812
Ah, I was afraid this might happen.

10:01.977 --> 10:07.272
You know, he's on so many different neuroleptics,
and tricyclics, that there's no telling how they'll mix.

10:07.448 --> 10:08.982
But what can you do?

10:09.158 --> 10:10.980
Medicine's not a science.

10:11.155 --> 10:13.110
What exactly are you treating him for?

10:13.286 --> 10:16.073
/There's not really a name for what Tracy has.

10:16.248 --> 10:21.452
Basically it's erratic tendencies, and delusions,
brought on by excessive notoriety.

10:21.628 --> 10:24.701
And certainly not helped
by my wildly experimental treatments.

10:24.878 --> 10:27.372
Boy, I'm being awfully
open with you, miss.

10:27.547 --> 10:29.791
I should not have taken
those blue things.

10:29.967 --> 10:31.082
So, is he dangerous?

10:31.256 --> 10:36.762
/No, he should be fine, so long as you keep him
away from bright lights, loud music and crowds.

10:36.926 --> 10:39.183
I'll call in a prescription
for something to settle him down,

10:39.347 --> 10:40.971
as soon as possible.

10:41.147 --> 10:44.851
Uh...do you need anything for yourself?

10:45.028 --> 10:45.561
What? No.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.680
Just, where can I pick up Tracy's prescription?

10:47.857 --> 10:50.983
Ms. Lemon, they need you upstairs
in Mr. Donaghy's office immediately.

10:51.157 --> 10:55.363
Kenneth, I need you to go to RiteDrug,
46th and 8th, pick up Tracy's medicine fast, okay?

10:55.537 --> 10:58.071
Yes, sir.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.620
What is it?
What's the emergency?

11:07.797 --> 11:09.411
How's this for an opening line?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.582
When I first met Jack Welch,
I thought he was such a great golfer,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.591
he made Bob Darnell
look like Randy Barnes.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.210
That's fine. Do that.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.550
I don't know.

11:17.716 --> 11:20.011
Might be distasteful
if Randy's widow's in the audience.

11:20.187 --> 11:21.012
What did you come up with?

11:21.188 --> 11:24.050
I have a bigger problem, Jack.
I don't think Tracy's ready to do Conan.

11:24.228 --> 11:27.563
I think you should let Jenna do it,
and maybe Tracy could do it in a couple of weeks.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.390
Jenna's not a star.

11:28.565 --> 11:30.021
She's capable,
but she's not a star.

11:30.196 --> 11:31.730
She's got a movie coming out next month.

11:31.907 --> 11:32.691
What movie?

11:32.865 --> 11:35.441
"The Rrr Jrr."

11:35.615 --> 11:36.323
The what?

11:36.488 --> 11:37.530
Tracy's acting nuts. 

11:37.697 --> 11:39.443
He's having problems with his medication.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.573
Did you call Dr. Spa-che-men?

11:41.748 --> 11:43.201
- Yeah, I did.
- Then he'll be fine.

11:43.377 --> 11:48.751
Leo's an excellent physician.
And a pretty good dentist.

11:49.546 --> 11:52.122
Is that rehearsal?
Oh no--Oh!

11:52.295 --> 11:53.710
No, this Tracy situation
is really...

11:53.886 --> 11:56.960
Are we still talking about that?
Do I have to come in and run your show?

11:57.136 --> 11:58.880
Or could you take this one
thing off my plate?

11:59.057 --> 12:00.880
No,  I got it.

12:01.058 --> 12:02.433
I'll figure it out.

12:02.595 --> 12:05.802
- What?
- Don't ask.

12:07.605 --> 12:13.150
Who is this leader of men?
What can I do for you, handsome?

12:21.205 --> 12:21.783
Liz...

12:21.957 --> 12:23.450
I wanted you to be the first to know.

12:23.616 --> 12:26.282
After the way Jack treated me today,
I can't work here anymore. I quit.

12:26.456 --> 12:28.120
Oh, Jenna, I really
don't have time for this.

12:28.297 --> 12:31.162
Then, I guess this is goodbye.

12:31.337 --> 12:33.421
Okay. Jenna don't quit.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.672
The show can't go on without you.

12:34.836 --> 12:36.672
You're my muse, you're
a modern-day Lucille Ball.

12:36.847 --> 12:37.712
You're prettier
than Deborah Messing.

12:37.886 --> 12:39.302
Please don't quit.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.260
Well, if that's the way you feel,
I'll stay. Okay.

12:43.437 --> 12:45.513
Oh, it's Dennis. Oh.

12:45.686 --> 12:47.801
Do you have any food?
I'm getting really low blood sugar.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.021
Are you dieting finally?
What are you doing?

12:50.187 --> 12:53.563
South Beach,
Master Cleanse?

12:53.737 --> 12:54.482
Hello?

12:54.657 --> 12:56.902
Whoa, gimme, gimme. Shoo.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.273
Liz, hey.
It's me, Dennis.

12:58.447 --> 12:59.571
Dennis, what do you want?

12:59.736 --> 13:00.572
(Dennis on the phone) Do me a huge favor.

13:00.737 --> 13:01.821
Call Ticketmaster right away.

13:01.997 --> 13:03.700
Nickleback just added another date, right?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.621
I would do it on your computer,
but I'm downloading a game right now.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.872
No, I can't do that for you.

13:08.036 --> 13:10.202
Just be home tonight
when I get there, okay?

13:10.377 --> 13:12.123
I need to talk to you about something.

13:12.296 --> 13:14.582
Word.

13:14.798 --> 13:15.790
(Tracy) Blue man!

13:15.966 --> 13:19.380
That blue dude keeps following me!

13:19.558 --> 13:21.763
Meek, eep.

13:21.928 --> 13:23.131
All right, let's get him down
to Conan's hair and make-up

13:23.308 --> 13:28.052
and hopefully Kenneth
will be back any minute.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.270
Oh, my.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.533
(Tracy) No! No! Agh!

13:41.698 --> 13:44.112
No! No!

13:44.495 --> 13:45.990
The blue man is runnin' up on me.

13:46.157 --> 13:46.703
There's no blue man.

13:46.865 --> 13:51.541
I can't take the blue man.
I don't want the blue man.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.621
All right, all right.

13:53.797 --> 13:54.253
Hey, Liz.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.330
What's up?

13:55.507 --> 13:56.753
Oh, hi, Conan.
How are you?

13:56.927 --> 13:57.833
Good.

13:58.006 --> 14:00.090
You still going out
with that guy from the pager store?

14:00.258 --> 14:02.423
Who, Dennis?

14:02.596 --> 14:04.552
Yeah.

14:04.726 --> 14:06.380
You still, um...

14:06.555 --> 14:08.093
How's your wife?

14:08.268 --> 14:10.392
Let's not do this, Elizabeth.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.350
Okay.

14:11.516 --> 14:12.643
(Tracy) Nyah, nyah, nyah.

14:12.816 --> 14:14.062
Nah!

14:14.227 --> 14:15.521
Vocal warm-ups.

14:15.687 --> 14:18.191
I'll tell him you came by.

14:18.356 --> 14:20.651
Okay.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.952
Whoa, he licked all of those.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.720
After you, ma'am.

14:50.895 --> 14:54.722
(Liz) Chewbacca, may I
speak to Tracy, please?

14:54.898 --> 14:55.312
How's it going?

14:55.478 --> 14:55.813
No!

14:55.975 --> 14:58.561
Past Pete is here
to kill Future Pete!

14:58.735 --> 15:00.851
It's going great.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.193
No!

15:03.695 --> 15:05.822
(Liz) It's all right,
Tracy. Come back.

15:05.985 --> 15:06.900
Yes, ma'am.

15:07.077 --> 15:12.740
Do you have a prescription
[whispering] for Mr. Tracy Jordan?

15:16.798 --> 15:17.793
(Liz) Come on out of there, buddy.

15:17.968 --> 15:19.372
Oh, I almost forgot.

15:19.547 --> 15:21.290
Jack would like to see you
up in his office.

15:21.466 --> 15:25.052
Oh, I don't have time for this.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.880
Yes, Jonathan tell him
I've got my hands full with Tracy.

15:28.057 --> 15:28.841
You sound upset.

15:29.017 --> 15:30.011
(Liz) I am upset.

15:30.186 --> 15:34.262
Come on up and
we'll talk about it.

15:46.615 --> 15:49.403
Fine. I will try the other location.

15:49.577 --> 15:54.832
But frankly, LaDonica,
you have not been real helpful.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.122
We'll get to your
problem in a minute.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.250
Have you had a chance
to think of my zinger?

16:04.427 --> 16:09.421
"Well, it's almost Thanksgiving, everybody.
"And I know what this crowd's giving thanks for.

16:09.598 --> 16:12.722
Estate tax reform."

16:13.516 --> 16:15.600
That is terrific.
I really enjoyed that.

16:15.766 --> 16:20.433
But, do you think it's too topical?
Damn, I wish this event were tonight.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.152
It's not tonight?
When is it?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.443
February.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.901
Why are you wearing a tux?

16:28.078 --> 16:32.280
It's after 6:00.
What am I, a farmer?

16:32.827 --> 16:35.412
It's 6:00.

16:46.427 --> 16:48.921
You are right after
this commercial, Mr. Jordan.

16:49.098 --> 16:52.050
You can do this.

16:53.015 --> 16:54.642
Mr. Blue man.

16:54.807 --> 16:59.970
You're gonna tell me my feet stink?
You don't even have feet. Blue man!

17:00.147 --> 17:01.730
Blue man, where your feet at?

17:01.895 --> 17:06.063
(woman) This is home to Late Night
with Conan O'Brien.

17:06.237 --> 17:07.982
That's right.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.481
Now we are on the...

17:10.657 --> 17:11.740
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.150
This is a page coming through.

17:13.328 --> 17:14.453
I'm sorry.

17:14.615 --> 17:15.363
Let me just...

17:15.535 --> 17:18.912
(Pete) Let him through!

17:30.885 --> 17:32.881
No. Please.

17:33.055 --> 17:34.593
Here it is!

17:34.768 --> 17:36.931
No.

17:39.608 --> 17:40.642
Pete! I'm trying.

17:40.816 --> 17:41.430
Give me his pills!

17:41.605 --> 17:43.892
Here.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.193
They're from Dr. Spaceman.

17:47.356 --> 17:47.980
(Conan) ...my first guest tonight

17:48.157 --> 17:49.691
from his numerous hit releases including

17:49.865 --> 17:52.943
"President Homeboy"
and "Honky Grandma Be Tripping."

17:53.115 --> 17:55.651
Or you may know him from
his last appearance on this show,

17:55.828 --> 17:58.033
when he tried
to stab me in the face.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.871
(Stage manager) Gotta go! Excuse me.

18:00.036 --> 18:02.410
Tracy.

18:02.918 --> 18:07.083
(Conan) Please welcome Tracy Jordan.

18:12.807 --> 18:15.421
You know, you really went above
and beyond for that guy today.

18:15.598 --> 18:19.512
I just hope we get away with it.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.612
This is going on a little long. 

18:31.778 --> 18:32.980
Don't, don't.
Don't do that.

18:33.158 --> 18:35.112
Pants on. Pants on.

18:35.287 --> 18:35.691
Sit in the chair, buddy.

18:35.868 --> 18:36.950
Sit in the chair. Sit down.

18:37.116 --> 18:37.783
Sit. Oh!

18:37.956 --> 18:40.492
Sit down!

18:48.045 --> 18:49.000
That a boy.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.040
(Conan)  Good to have you here.

18:50.218 --> 18:52.540
That was great, and you're--

18:52.718 --> 18:54.212
And he's asleep.

18:54.388 --> 18:58.512
Which...is okay, 'cause at least
he didn't murder me.

18:58.688 --> 19:00.721
(Conan) We'll take a break, and...

19:00.908 --> 19:02.183
Tracy Jordan, everybody!

19:02.357 --> 19:04.310
Hey, you did good, kid.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.272
Give me that.

19:14.735 --> 19:18.493
I really gotta eat something.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.040
I've lost track of it!

19:32.507 --> 19:33.173
Hey.

19:33.347 --> 19:35.883
Hey. What's up?

19:36.056 --> 19:38.553
I didn't know what you wanted,
so I ordered you a cheeseburger.

19:38.726 --> 19:40.340
Oh, Dennis. Thank you.

19:40.515 --> 19:44.303
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

19:44.478 --> 19:46.812
So what did you want
to talk to me about, huh?

19:46.975 --> 19:49.520
Nothing. I forget.

19:49.695 --> 19:52.101
I just want to listen to you play Halo
'til I fall asleep.

19:52.276 --> 19:52.862
Ah, that's baloney!

19:53.028 --> 19:54.571
How did the grenade not kill him?

19:54.737 --> 19:56.323
He was standing right next to it.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.361
You know what, Liz?
This controller's defective.

19:59.536 --> 20:01.782
Liz?

20:13.427 --> 20:16.343
Well, I got started in
the NBC page program.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.763
And before you know it,
I'm making hit movies

20:18.927 --> 20:23.680
with my good friend,
and roommate, Zach Braff.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.223
What?

20:26.397 --> 20:27.350
Who told you that?

20:27.517 --> 20:30.981
Well, yes.
I do know how to clog.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.863
But I don't think anybody
wants to see me do that.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.651
You do? Really?

20:37.827 --> 20:40.112
Okay.

20:45.288 --> 20:46.530
You're a weird guy, Kenneth.

20:46.706 --> 20:50.500
See you tomorrow, Mr. O'Brien.
