At least if I was in a theater

Ah, hey, Fred.
Hi.

13:31.716 --> 13:32.926
He's coming aboard
to join the team.

13:33.009 --> 13:34.594

13:34.677 --> 13:38.181
No, this is just
my after-hours endeavor.

13:38.264 --> 13:39.516
This is my brother Hugh.

13:39.599 --> 13:41.768
Hi.
He's a first-rate animator.

13:41.851 --> 13:43.811
Welcome to our corporate
headquarters.

13:43.895 --> 13:47.565
Fred's told me a lot about you.
Interesting, uh, haircut.

13:47.649 --> 13:49.692
Yeah, thanks.

13:51.945 --> 13:54.197
Quite a palace you've got here.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.741
I told you, Fred,
it's just a start.

13:56.824 --> 13:58.743
It's only the beginning.

13:58.826 --> 14:01.955
Nowhere to go but up.

14:02.038 --> 14:05.375
Let me show you
what we're working on.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.793
I've already created

14:06.876 --> 14:08.461
several animations
based upon local happenings.

14:08.545 --> 14:10.839
How so?

14:10.922 --> 14:12.632
Pesman always had us
drawing about news stories,

14:12.715 --> 14:13.842
because that's what sold.

14:13.925 --> 14:15.593
Right.

14:15.677 --> 14:19.138
So I've created animations
based upon the same happenings.

14:19.222 --> 14:22.058
Take a serious story
and make people laugh.

14:22.141 --> 14:25.895
See, I read the paper,
and I take the headline...

14:25.979 --> 14:28.815
and make that into
an animation.

14:32.235 --> 14:35.446
Pot holes, a serious problem
in Kansas City.

14:35.530 --> 14:37.073
Perfect, let's do that next.

Says right here in the
Kansas City Telegram.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.621
So, we're going to tell people
news they already know.

14:43.705 --> 14:46.332
I guess that's why
they call it a tell-egram.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.126
We're not going to
tell them anything,

That's it. Ubbe,
you're great with lettering.

14:59.512 --> 15:01.431
Can you create
a title card that says,

15:01.514 --> 15:02.765
"Newman Laugh-o-Grams"?

15:02.849 --> 15:05.310
So these are going to be shown
in Newman's theater?

15:05.393 --> 15:07.228
Is he asking to buy
a Laugh-o-Gram?

15:07.312 --> 15:09.898
No... but he will.

15:20.700 --> 15:21.868
Mr. Newman...

15:21.951 --> 15:23.828
What can I do for you?

15:23.912 --> 15:24.913
I have an animation here

15:24.996 --> 15:26.289
that might be of interest
to your theater.

15:26.372 --> 15:29.250
A sort of bonus reel
on local Kansas City issues.

15:29.334 --> 15:31.920

Hi, Aunt Charlotte.
Hi, darling, how are you?

46:27.317 --> 46:29.235
I'm good, how are you?
Wonderful.

46:29.319 --> 46:32.071
Hey... was your travel restful?

46:32.155 --> 46:34.532
Somewhat, I'm pretty exhausted.

46:34.616 --> 46:35.909
Did you come through Topeka?

46:35.992 --> 46:37.577
No, sir.

46:37.619 --> 46:38.536
Well, Charlotte,

he must think anybody
that lives in Hollywood

46:40.622 --> 46:41.831
is kind of vapid.

46:42.624 --> 46:45.335
No, sir, we just didn't come
through Topeka.

46:45.418 --> 46:47.837
We must have bypassed
the station there.

46:47.921 --> 46:53.051
Well, it don't seem
particularly likely.

46:53.134 --> 46:57.013

to get a job right away.

You okay?

47:46.771 --> 47:49.357
Yeah, I, uh, I'm the one
working on patience.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.402
I've had enough
for the both of us.

47:52.485 --> 47:54.821
I'm thinking about directing.

47:57.574 --> 47:59.576
I just don't know
how to go about it.

Well, you could get a job--
any job in a studio...

48:06.958 --> 48:08.543
the way you started out
in animation.

48:08.626 --> 48:11.546

Robert's getting huffy.

48:50.293 --> 48:51.711
He's wondering when
you're going to get a job?

48:51.794 --> 48:53.421
He is?

48:53.505 --> 48:55.131
Ah, he is so impatient.

48:55.215 --> 48:57.383
Are all of you Disney's
like that?

48:57.467 --> 48:59.135
Ah, it's the Disney standard.

48:59.219 --> 49:01.179
He says you go out to the
studios every day...

49:01.262 --> 49:03.306
what do you do
when you get there?

49:03.389 --> 49:04.807
Are you applying for jobs.

49:04.891 --> 49:06.643
Not exactly.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.019
Then what?

49:08.102 --> 49:10.730
I can't quite explain it.

49:10.813 --> 49:14.526
There's something there for me,
but it's not what I can see.

49:14.609 --> 49:16.486
That makes no sense.

49:16.569 --> 49:20.782
I'm aware of that,
it doesn't make sense to me.

49:20.865 --> 49:24.202
At the studios, I see
everyone doing one thing...

49:24.285 --> 49:26.579
actors, directors, writers,
guards, secretaries;

49:26.663 --> 49:28.957
everyone has their own piece.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.169
But when I was animating,
we were doing everything...

49:33.253 --> 49:37.173
drawing, inking, camera, gags,
whatever needed to be done.

49:37.257 --> 49:39.676
Everyone has
their strengths of course...

49:39.759 --> 49:42.512
but in the end it was
Ubbe and Rudy and myself

49:42.595 --> 49:43.930
that were making Alice.

49:46.266 --> 49:49.686
I feel as if that story
is drawn in my own blood.

50:07.036 --> 50:08.413
I'm sorry to bother you,

50:08.496 --> 50:10.832

Yes, please.

Okay, now... just talk

you want to say.

Okay.

Dear Miss Winkler...

51:17.065 --> 51:19.359
This is to inform you

51:19.442 --> 51:22.987
that I am no longer
with Laugh-O-Gram Films.

51:23.071 --> 51:25.990
I'm starting a studio
in Los Angeles...

51:26.074 --> 51:32.205
for the purpose of producing
a novel series of animations...

51:32.288 --> 51:35.917
that I have previously
written you about.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.670
In the past, all animations
combining live actors

51:38.753 --> 51:41.089
have been produced
in an amateur manner...

51:41.172 --> 51:44.092
with animators doing
the acting, photographing, etc.

51:44.175 --> 51:45.802
It is my intention to employ

51:45.885 --> 51:47.262
only trained
and experienced people.

51:47.345 --> 51:49.430
Good.

51:49.514 --> 51:50.932
The first picture
of this new idea,

51:51.015 --> 51:52.100
which I have just completed...

51:52.183 --> 51:54.227
was made in Kansas City
under big difficulties.

51:54.310 --> 51:55.728
I would appreciate an interview

51:55.812 --> 51:57.188
with your
representative here...

51:57.272 --> 51:59.566
that I may screen
several comedies

51:59.649 --> 52:01.943

new idea. Sincerely--

for an interview.

52:21.796 --> 52:23.423
Please, Robert!

52:23.506 --> 52:27.886
Well, it's just foolishness,
Charlotte, for God sakes.

52:32.140 --> 52:35.518
Don't let him
discourage you, Walt.

52:35.602 --> 52:38.396
Here, I think
the letter is finished.

53:41.709 --> 53:43.378
I'm sorry Mrs. Winkler,

53:43.461 --> 53:46.381
but that's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

53:46.464 --> 53:49.634
I've never seen anything
like that before.

53:49.717 --> 53:53.388
Then why did you stop clapping?
What do you think, dear?

53:53.471 --> 53:57.141
Well, it's no Felix the Cat,
but it's-- it's wonderful.

53:57.225 --> 53:59.394
Who made it?

53:59.477 --> 54:01.396
Walt Disney... a young chap

54:01.479 --> 54:04.440
from Kansas City,
who just moved to California.

54:04.524 --> 54:06.276
I just sent him a letter

54:06.359 --> 54:08.111
commissioning 12 more
just like that.

Ah, this morning, but you
got in so late last night...

55:07.295 --> 55:09.464
Well, congratulations.

55:09.547 --> 55:12.175

55:12.258 --> 55:13.551
I'm crazy about animation,

55:13.635 --> 55:15.929
but I spent so much time
doing the business...

55:16.012 --> 55:18.890
that it cut part of the
creative side out of me.

55:18.973 --> 55:23.269
I can't do it by myself. I need
someone that I can trust.

55:23.353 --> 55:26.231
I need someone who
knows finance.

55:26.314 --> 55:28.942
Oh, no, no, Walt, no.

You're a natural.

55:55.218 --> 55:56.386
So, you'll do it?

55:59.597 --> 56:01.808
On one condition.

56:01.891 --> 56:03.726

56:03.810 --> 56:06.646
You need to be straight

56:13.236 --> 56:15.864
I won't ask you to hire Edna...

but I need you to steer clear
of any office romance.

56:20.118 --> 56:22.036
I've already decided

56:22.120 --> 56:25.039
that I won't marry

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:36.092 --> 56:38.011
Mr. Disney, your brother
will need his rest now.

56:38.094 --> 56:39.387
Yeah, I'll see you soon, Roy.

We have a lot to catch up on.

56:58.531 --> 56:59.699
I bet.

57:04.037 --> 57:07.874
Look at the size of this room.
Look how large it is.

57:07.957 --> 57:10.376
Tall ceilings,
lots of space for desks...

57:10.460 --> 57:12.253
perfect for your workshop.

57:12.337 --> 57:15.298
There's certainly enough space
to swing a cat in.

57:15.381 --> 57:16.633
And it's only $5 a month,

57:16.716 --> 57:18.843
and we'll throw the desk
in on top of that.

57:18.927 --> 57:20.595
Sounds great.

57:20.678 --> 57:23.014
You think about it, we'll walk
outside and you let us know.

57:23.097 --> 57:24.098
Okay.
Thank you.

57:24.182 --> 57:26.476
Thank you.
Thanks.

57:36.236 --> 57:39.822
Yeah, I think this will work.
Get the equipment in here.

57:39.906 --> 57:44.327
And ah, oh, ah, I forgot to let
you know that Rudy and Hugh...

57:44.410 --> 57:45.870
said yes, so they're going
to be coming out.

57:45.954 --> 57:47.956
And Fred?

57:48.039 --> 57:49.040
Well, you know,

57:49.165 --> 57:50.792
you invite one guy
and you invite them all, right?

57:50.875 --> 57:52.669
Unless they're
still angry with me.

57:52.752 --> 57:53.795
Probably.

57:53.878 --> 57:55.088
Well, we'll see what happens.

57:55.171 --> 57:56.881
But, even if
everybody says yes...

57:56.965 --> 57:58.508
we're still going to need
more animators.

57:58.591 --> 58:00.927
[ROY] Just remember
we have a budget, Walt.

58:01.010 --> 58:02.178
Any new animators
you take on

58:02.262 --> 58:04.222
will have to work for less
than the normal wage.

58:04.305 --> 58:06.558
Who's going to do that?

58:06.641 --> 58:07.976
Women.

58:08.059 --> 58:09.894
Roy Disney.

58:09.978 --> 58:11.312
Edna, it's true.

58:11.396 --> 58:13.982
You just got the right to vote,
women need jobs.

58:14.065 --> 58:17.527
He's right, Edna, women
are detail oriented...

58:17.610 --> 58:19.279
they can ink and paint.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.822
Women are the ones
that go to the shows...

58:20.905 --> 58:25.076
so if they like it,
then the men will go, too.

58:25.159 --> 58:27.912
Well, you can rest assured,
I won't be working here.

58:27.996 --> 58:29.455
We've already
discussed that, honey.

58:29.539 --> 58:31.875
But I will be here often.

58:31.958 --> 58:33.376
So now what, Dis?

58:33.459 --> 58:37.297
Dis? What am I, Dis #2?
I mean, I think I--

58:37.380 --> 58:39.257
I am the ultimate Dis.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.594
Roy! He is still recovering!

58:42.677 --> 58:45.722
I can take this
rapscallion any day.

58:48.391 --> 58:51.519
Well, now that Ubbe is here,
my drawing days are over.

58:51.603 --> 58:52.979
I think I'm going to focus
on writing,

58:53.062 --> 58:54.063
directing and producing.

58:54.147 --> 58:56.441
Are you sure, kid?

58:56.524 --> 58:57.525
Well, Ubbe's the talented one,

58:57.609 --> 58:58.902
he's a better animator
than I am...

58:58.985 --> 59:01.362
and one of the most
loyal guys I know.

59:01.446 --> 59:02.655
Thanks, Dis.

59:02.739 --> 59:05.867
All right! Let's go find
us an Alice.

59:05.950 --> 59:08.786
<i>( MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

59:10.246 --> 59:13.291
Okay, let's get started.

59:13.374 --> 59:17.629
Hi, I'm Walt.
Now, who is up first?

59:17.712 --> 59:18.963
Go on, get up there.
Get up there.

59:19.047 --> 59:20.048
No!

59:20.131 --> 59:21.382
She's just a little shy,
that's all.

59:21.466 --> 59:23.718
And what is your name?

59:23.801 --> 59:25.762
William.

59:25.845 --> 59:29.182
Thank you, next.

59:29.265 --> 59:33.394
Ah, I told you to use
your girl's voice. Come on.

59:33.478 --> 59:36.022
Hi, my name is Tina,
I'm so excited to be here.

59:36.105 --> 59:37.649
I prepared
a little dance for you.

59:47.825 --> 59:49.953
Ah, we'll let you know.

59:50.036 --> 59:52.205
Ah, excuse me,

59:52.288 --> 59:56.459
aren't you a little too tall
to be playing Alice?

59:59.546 --> 01:00:02.549
I think I have a better idea.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.634
I need my original Alice.

01:00:04.717 --> 01:00:07.053
Yeah, bring that flat.
Where to?

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.514
Make a little set. Yeah.

01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:13.893
Yeah, we can set some things
over there.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.478
All right, Virginia,
are you ready?

01:00:15.562 --> 01:00:19.065
Okay, great, now look over
at Hugh, all right...

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:22.402
now you see something very,
very far away behind him.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.154
You're not sure what it is,
but it makes you smile.

01:00:25.238 --> 01:00:27.615
Now wave "hi" to it.

01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:28.700
All right, now you see

01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:31.911
that it's a very,
very big bear.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.955
All right, now duck down.

01:00:34.038 --> 01:00:36.833
Okay now-- now right behind you
in the barrel,

01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:38.501
a bunny rabbit pops out.

01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:41.754
Yeah, that's right,
you can pet it. Yeah, good.

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.756
Okay, now you turn back
to that bear and you say...

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.259
"No, no, no, you can't
come over here."

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:49.220
Now jump up and down
like you mean it.

01:00:49.304 --> 01:00:50.430
Great, that's a cut.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.185
Ladies, can we help you?

01:00:55.268 --> 01:00:57.896
I'm here about the job,
to help with ink and paint.

01:00:57.979 --> 01:01:00.064
Oh yes, yes, come in.
All right.

01:01:00.148 --> 01:01:02.025
[WALT]
What is your name?

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:06.446
Lillian Bounds... here,
it says so on my resume.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.364
Oh.

01:01:10.617 --> 01:01:11.826
What are you doing?

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:13.870
I'm getting a chair
for Miss Bounds.

01:01:17.332 --> 01:01:19.667
This is an interview,
not a date.

01:01:24.464 --> 01:01:26.799
Ah, and your name, Miss?

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.551
Oh, ah, Bridgit, but
I'm not here to interview...

01:01:28.635 --> 01:01:30.053
I'm just accompanying
Miss Bounds.

01:01:30.136 --> 01:01:34.307
Oh, I see. Ah, have you
ever worked before?

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:38.311
Sir, I know where
you're going with this.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:42.982
I am willing to do whatever it
takes, I am a dedicated person.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:47.445
In Idaho, I learned that there
is no substitute for hard work.

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:50.156
Idaho has great potatoes.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.535
Wonderful.

01:01:53.618 --> 01:01:56.955
Well, it's $10 a week,
so you can start tomorrow.

01:01:57.038 --> 01:01:59.290
I can't work for less than $12.

01:01:59.374 --> 01:02:01.084
Well, then $12 it is.

01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:08.800
What about you, Miss Bridgit,
we could use an extra hand.

01:02:08.883 --> 01:02:10.760
Oh, I don't know.

01:02:13.179 --> 01:02:14.722
She'd love a job.

01:02:14.806 --> 01:02:15.807
Wonderful.

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:17.016
Congratulations,
welcome to the team.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.101
Thank you.

01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:20.353
Okay, let's rehearse this
one more time.

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.813
So you're out of tea

01:02:21.896 --> 01:02:23.773
and you're looking out
into the distance...

01:02:23.857 --> 01:02:25.900
and then you see land
and you point...

01:02:25.984 --> 01:02:28.778
and then a bunch of fish jump
onto the boat all around you.

01:02:28.862 --> 01:02:31.197
Okay?
Okay.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.616
All right. Okay, so we have
just enough film in the camera

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.701
for one more take.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:37.787
So... no pressure.

01:02:37.871 --> 01:02:41.583
Okay, let's see the ocean move.
Go ahead and roll it, Fred.

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:44.252
And action.

With the increasing quality
of the Alice series.

01:03:06.441 --> 01:03:08.693
Of course, much work
remains to be done.

01:03:08.776 --> 01:03:11.446
Much, very much.

01:03:11.529 --> 01:03:13.740
Well, the problem still remains

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:17.160
that we're spending
as much as we make.

01:03:17.243 --> 01:03:20.038
More tea, dear?

01:03:20.121 --> 01:03:23.249
[MARGARET]
Yes, I'd love some.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.419
I find tea relaxes the mind.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:30.173
It's very useful in discussing
business, don't you think?

01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:33.927
Problem is--

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.471
The problem is
we pay you up front...

01:03:36.554 --> 01:03:41.351
that we don't realize a profit
for at least six months.

01:03:41.434 --> 01:03:45.063
But whatever that profit is,
you keep it.

there are other distributors.

Yeah, let's not yell
fire just yet.

01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:55.532
Actually,
when we took on Alice...

01:03:55.615 --> 01:03:59.160
I was forced
to put in a copyright.

01:03:59.244 --> 01:04:00.787
How do you--

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.540
We pay you for the originals,
it's a sale.

01:04:03.623 --> 01:04:05.625
We own the originals.

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.585
We make the prints
and the negatives,

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:09.087
and lease them.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:12.048
The copyright protects us,
not you.

01:04:13.967 --> 01:04:15.468
Excuse me.

01:04:21.474 --> 01:04:25.061
Walt takes great pride
in his work.

01:04:25.144 --> 01:04:26.521
He spends every waking minute

01:04:26.604 --> 01:04:28.439
thinking of ways
to make it better.

01:04:28.523 --> 01:04:31.901
I don't suppose it could have
ever occurred to him

01:04:31.985 --> 01:04:34.028
that someone else
could own that?

01:04:37.949 --> 01:04:41.077
If you don't mind,
I'll go join my brother.

they're emotional.

we have endeavored
to do nothing but gags.

after another...

the quality of the picture--

Walt, can you slow down.

01:05:09.189 --> 01:05:10.982
I can't slow down.

01:05:11.065 --> 01:05:12.567
But I don't have it all yet.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:15.028
Okay, well what do you
have so far?

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:20.366

doubt-- something about gags?

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:21.993

Everything will be back

You're such a hard worker,
you never take a break.

01:07:11.686 --> 01:07:14.022
You learned in Idaho

01:07:14.105 --> 01:07:17.192
that there's no substitute
for hard work.

01:07:17.275 --> 01:07:19.777
I learned that from my father.

01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:22.155
He sounds like a wise man.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:26.034
Well, he does know
the value of hard work.

01:07:26.117 --> 01:07:28.411
Right before I was born,
he worked as a carpenter...

01:07:28.494 --> 01:07:32.916
on the World's Fair buildings
for a dollar a day.

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:34.667
Somehow out of that,

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.213
he and my mother saved enough
to go into business together.

01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:40.882
I don't know how they did it,

01:07:40.965 --> 01:07:44.302
but eventually he moved
to Chicago as a contractor...

01:07:44.385 --> 01:07:46.804
so my mother
would draw up the plans

01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:48.973
and my father
would build the houses.

01:07:49.057 --> 01:07:52.685
They were a real team.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:57.106
My father always wanted
to get back to the farm...

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:59.984
so he took what he had made

01:08:00.068 --> 01:08:02.487
and bought a farm
in Marceline...

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:06.658
48 acres,
beautiful orchard there.

01:08:06.741 --> 01:08:13.456
Huh, then my father got sick
and we were forced to sell it.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.667
But he never gave up.

01:08:16.751 --> 01:08:18.169
He sold that farm

01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:21.005
and he took the money
and we moved to Kansas.

01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:25.260
Ever since then...

after my dreams...

It's Mintz,

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.582
is Walter available?
It's urgent.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:57.500
I'll check. One moment, please.

01:08:57.584 --> 01:08:58.960
Walter?

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.377
What is it?

01:09:00.461 --> 01:09:02.296
[BRIDGIT]
There's a Mintz on the phone,

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.590
he said it's urgent.

01:09:06.301 --> 01:09:09.261
What is it now?

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.264
I've got it.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:12.807
Charles...

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:13.933
<i>look, we're very busy
here today.</i>

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:15.977
Good, and Walter, look...

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.437
I've just had a chance

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.606
to finish review
of the last Alice animation.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.064
I must say,

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:23.568
I am quite disappointed
with you and your team.

01:09:23.651 --> 01:09:28.323
<i>Ah, you need a new Alice.
The quality is not presentable.</i>

01:09:28.406 --> 01:09:31.201
Well, Charles, I'm sorry
to hear that you feel that way.

01:09:31.283 --> 01:09:33.286
Virginia has worked
for us before.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:35.537
Well, find somebody else.

01:09:35.622 --> 01:09:36.788
<i>Look...</i>

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.167
Walter, I want to help you.

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:40.542
I'm going to be sending

01:09:40.627 --> 01:09:42.921
my brother-in-law George
to join you and your team.

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:44.631
He's an expert.

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:46.424
He's going to teach you...

01:09:46.508 --> 01:09:49.135
<i>how to deliver the quality
the Mintz name demands.</i>

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:50.720
Show him the utmost courtesy.

01:09:50.803 --> 01:09:52.680
Charles,
this is not a day care.

01:09:52.764 --> 01:09:54.182
We run a very tight...

Walter, I'm not asking.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.148
Good day.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:11.324
This guy shows no respect.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:15.078
Okay, please take
one step to your left.

01:10:15.161 --> 01:10:20.834
Ah, no, your other left.
Okay, great.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:24.546
Ah, be frightened,
there's a bear coming.

Though she has a nice smile.

01:10:33.721 --> 01:10:37.350
So, you're happy
to be frightened?

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.228
This is getting very expensive.

01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:43.231
Yes, I know. Go ahead and cut.

01:10:45.817 --> 01:10:48.653
These lines remind me
of "Alice's Day at Sea".

01:10:48.736 --> 01:10:50.238
Yes, and we fixed those, Fred.

01:10:50.321 --> 01:10:52.699
That's why
we need to fix this...

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.409
when we put it on film,
it's going to be jerky.

01:10:54.492 --> 01:10:56.744
Then I guess we won't
let you splice anymore.

01:10:56.828 --> 01:10:58.913
Or let you direct.

01:10:58.997 --> 01:11:00.290
Oh, man.

01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:02.625

who used to work here.

[LILLIAN]
Good morning.

01:11:07.005 --> 01:11:11.384
Hi, Lily... ah, we'll go over
my schedule in a minute.

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:15.388
You know, Walt, I think
she wants a man, not a boy.

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.140
That's true, you know,
for a big shot...

01:11:17.223 --> 01:11:19.726
your face is as clean
as a pair of gams.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:22.270
I could grow a mustache faster
than any of you boys.

01:11:22.353 --> 01:11:25.607
Look on me,
ye peaches and despair.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:27.108
Well, peach, you're going to
have to shave that

01:11:27.192 --> 01:11:28.193
if you want in.

01:11:28.276 --> 01:11:30.069
It'll just be back tomorrow.

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:32.530
What's the pay off, Walt?

01:11:32.614 --> 01:11:35.074
A trip to Tijuana,
on company time.

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:36.409
( OOH-ING )

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.077
For anyone who beats me.

01:11:39.454 --> 01:11:42.415
And the winner gets to be...
my best man.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.334
What?

01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:46.961
Hey... nice job!

01:11:49.923 --> 01:11:52.342
You better win, even if
you have to paste one on.

01:12:02.435 --> 01:12:05.396
Roy's wedding was so nice.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.358
And it looked beautiful.

01:12:08.441 --> 01:12:11.110
Now at least I can shave.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:14.072
Why would you?

01:12:14.155 --> 01:12:19.786
You look more... yourself.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.538
Now that you have
a place to yourself,

01:12:21.621 --> 01:12:23.081
are you going to
learn how to cook?

01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:26.584
I was hoping that you
would do that for me.

01:12:26.668 --> 01:12:29.212
Cook?

01:12:29.295 --> 01:12:35.260
Cook, raise children,
everything.

01:12:37.428 --> 01:12:39.347
Walt Disney, what are you--

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:42.100
We talked about
saving for a new car.

01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:44.936
I'll let you decide...

01:12:45.019 --> 01:12:49.858
a new car or a ring?

01:12:49.941 --> 01:12:53.570
You can't ask me that.

01:12:54.779 --> 01:12:56.948
Will you be my Mrs. Disney?

01:13:04.956 --> 01:13:06.958
Yes!

01:13:10.503 --> 01:13:14.340
I want to make you
the happiest girl in the world.

01:13:27.729 --> 01:13:28.855
Yes.

Come on in.

Hey, Walt, there's a George
Winkler here to see you.

01:13:42.076 --> 01:13:44.329
Hugh, Hugh,
Margaret's brother is here,

01:13:44.412 --> 01:13:46.623
can you please
show him around?

01:13:46.706 --> 01:13:48.374
George, nice to see you again,

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.335
as you can see
we're very busy...

01:13:50.418 --> 01:13:52.086
so I hope you don't mind
if Hugh shows you around.

01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.464
Great.
Of course.

01:13:54.547 --> 01:13:55.673

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:00.678
Nice to m--

01:14:00.762 --> 01:14:02.931
Nice to meet you.

01:14:03.014 --> 01:14:09.145
Mr. Mintz sent me here to help
with the quality of the work.

01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:10.813
And who is Mr. Mintz?

01:14:10.897 --> 01:14:13.149
You don't know?

01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.735
No, I-- I'm sorry, I don't.

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:20.615
He is the one paying
for this entire operation.

01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:23.326
Oh, Margaret's husband...

01:14:23.409 --> 01:14:27.413
tell him he needs
to pay us more.

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:33.044
Fred, let me show you
around the studio.

01:14:33.127 --> 01:14:34.629
This is where
we design and draw

01:14:34.712 --> 01:14:35.839
all of our animations and...

01:14:35.922 --> 01:14:38.299
and that's
the inking department.

01:14:40.635 --> 01:14:43.680
Very beautiful.

01:14:45.557 --> 01:14:49.477
We like a positive work
environment.

01:14:49.561 --> 01:14:50.812
It keeps us creative.

01:14:50.895 --> 01:14:55.400
Well, where will I
be working from?

01:14:55.483 --> 01:14:57.318
You can work
out of that desk for now.

01:14:57.402 --> 01:14:59.404
We've got some deadlines
for this week, so...

01:14:59.487 --> 01:15:03.449
it's probably best if you start
with the next Alice drawings.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:05.827
Let's get back to work,
we have deadlines.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:11.374

I like that.

01:15:17.338 --> 01:15:19.883
You have no idea.

01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:28.391
It's a little tight.

01:15:34.772 --> 01:15:36.107
Hey!

01:15:40.862 --> 01:15:42.739
I am sorry.

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:03.801
Might be better if you,
ah, just stand.

01:16:03.885 --> 01:16:07.180
Yeah, we don't have--
we're short on chairs.

01:16:09.057 --> 01:16:11.142
Okay, come down the stairs.

01:16:11.226 --> 01:16:13.102
You're going to meet
your mother,

01:16:13.186 --> 01:16:15.313
she's going to take you
to the circus.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.902
George chose her?

01:16:20.985 --> 01:16:23.530
Yeah, he thinks
he knows comedy.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:25.782
You see your mother
in the distance,

01:16:25.865 --> 01:16:27.784
and you wave hello to her.

01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:30.537
She is wonderful.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.499
You could lighten up a little.
This is a comedy.

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:39.629
How about a smile?
Have some fun.

01:16:39.712 --> 01:16:42.674
You are confusing her.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:46.761
How about some coffee?

01:16:46.845 --> 01:16:48.471
Okay, why don't you go ahead
and cut for now.

01:16:48.555 --> 01:16:50.181
That's a cut for now.

01:16:50.265 --> 01:16:52.642
We're going to go get you some
candy, get you some energy.

( GEORGE CHUCKLES )

01:16:53.935 --> 01:16:55.019
It's a great choice, George.

01:16:55.103 --> 01:16:59.983
It is very good. Very good.

01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:03.152
I'll be sure to let, uh,
your brother-in-law know...

01:17:03.236 --> 01:17:04.946
that this was--
this was your choice.

01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:12.829
You did very good work
on the Alice draft.

01:17:12.912 --> 01:17:15.540
Thanks, George.

01:17:15.623 --> 01:17:20.879
You know, Fred,
it wouldn't surprise me...

01:17:20.962 --> 01:17:24.757
if you had your
own studio one day.

01:17:27.385 --> 01:17:31.014
Well, I've learned a lot
over the years.

01:17:31.097 --> 01:17:33.516
It would be great
to have my own studio.

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:42.358
But... let's keep quiet
about that for now.

01:17:45.153 --> 01:17:47.864
I won't tell anyone.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.330
If it says Disney Brothers
when people call the studio...

01:17:55.413 --> 01:17:57.290
who do they think is in charge?

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.500
Is that relevant?

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:00.251
The older one.

01:18:00.335 --> 01:18:02.295
Ah, we've been over this,
ah, how is that possible,

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.380
you sign your name
on everything.

01:18:04.464 --> 01:18:05.798
They have taken my work,

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:08.510
they find a way to own
everything that I produce...

01:18:08.593 --> 01:18:11.387
at least let me have
my name on the studio.

01:18:14.307 --> 01:18:16.142
Is it that important to you?

01:18:16.226 --> 01:18:19.145
Yes... if my name
is on the studio,

01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:21.773
then my name is on the film.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.533
Well, if that's the way
you want it to be--

01:18:31.616 --> 01:18:34.118
That's the way
I want it to be.

<i>WALT (V.O.)
I was always focused</i>

01:18:35.995 --> 01:18:37.455
<i>on making quality pictures.</i>

01:18:37.539 --> 01:18:41.000
<i>I suppose that's why we often
times went over budget...</i>

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:43.711

to build our new studio</i>

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:58.017
Oswald the Rabbit.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:00.228
Starting today,
we're the animators.

01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:02.981
What about Alice?

01:19:03.064 --> 01:19:07.235
We're winding down,
so we need a story for Oswald.

01:19:07.318 --> 01:19:08.862
What about Easter?

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:11.406
It's too religious
for the first animation.

01:19:11.489 --> 01:19:13.324
It will be Easter
when it comes out.

01:19:13.408 --> 01:19:16.286
And so, he's going to...
sing hymns?

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:18.496
Maybe he's a nervous father?

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:24.210
Yeah. He's pacing the hallway,
stomping his feet.

01:19:24.294 --> 01:19:26.129
Good, Hugh,

01:19:26.212 --> 01:19:28.631
you get it started and then
you pass it along to Ubbe.

01:19:28.715 --> 01:19:33.678
Walt, I will help Hugh
with the first drawing, yes?

01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:36.806
Hugh and Ubbe
will know what to do.

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:40.518
Any questions?
Let's get to work.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.859
Listen kid, I'm excited
about Oswald, too...

01:19:47.942 --> 01:19:49.402
but, right now
we really need to focus...

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:50.862
on catching up
with some of our bills.

01:19:50.945 --> 01:19:52.363
We are in the red, Walt.

01:19:52.447 --> 01:19:54.365
I mean, we're overpaying
all of our animators.

01:19:54.449 --> 01:19:56.784
We can't keep
going on like this.

01:19:56.868 --> 01:19:59.037
We need to reinvest in
new animations for the company.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.080
We need new characters
for Oswald.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:03.917
No, no, no. We don't have money
for any new characters.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.629
But we need it,
just a few bucks.

01:20:07.712 --> 01:20:09.339
A few bucks?

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:12.592
Please.

01:20:17.138 --> 01:20:20.141
Okay, I'll see what I can do,
but in the meantime...

01:20:20.225 --> 01:20:21.851
don't write any more checks

01:20:21.935 --> 01:20:24.479
until we actually have
money in the bank.

01:20:24.562 --> 01:20:28.942
I do that to give them hope
until we get the funds.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.110

I haven't heard from you in a
while, how is everything going?

01:20:42.497 --> 01:20:48.837
Very well, Charles.
I have been making friends.

01:20:51.005 --> 01:20:55.134
You know, Walt and Roy
are a very good team...

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:59.430
but, I think they
are running out of money.

01:20:59.514 --> 01:21:01.099
How do you know this?

01:21:02.809 --> 01:21:05.645

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:09.607
I had to lend
one of them money.

01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:12.610
Excellent! George, well done.

Walt, I'm not going
to bail you out again.

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:14.881
I'm not the only one around
here who feels that way.

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:17.050
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:18.885
Is there a problem, Friz?

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.179
Your bad checks
are the problem, Walt.

01:22:21.262 --> 01:22:23.765
It's the second time
this month.

01:22:23.848 --> 01:22:25.391
There must be a problem
at the bank.

Problem at the bank?

01:22:27.477 --> 01:22:30.355

We need the money, Walt.

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:41.324
You know, this is crazy.
Okay, Rudy's right. I quit.

01:22:48.373 --> 01:22:49.707
Walt, I'm with Friz.

01:22:58.716 --> 01:23:02.303
My check bounced also.

All the checks are bouncing.

01:23:10.728 --> 01:23:13.773
I don't know what's happening.

01:23:13.857 --> 01:23:16.192
It's all falling apart.

01:23:16.276 --> 01:23:18.278
I feel the rigor mortis
setting in.

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:21.573
Walt, you have a lot of people
that believe in you.

01:23:21.656 --> 01:23:23.783
Don't loose faith.

01:23:23.867 --> 01:23:26.744
I can't keep people
working on faith.

01:23:26.828 --> 01:23:29.122
I don't blame them for leaving.

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:31.666
They just don't have
the vision that you have...

01:23:31.749 --> 01:23:34.335
they don't see what you see.

01:23:34.419 --> 01:23:37.672

what I see anymore.

for what he believes in.

01:23:49.517 --> 01:23:51.311
So, you're just going
to give up?

01:23:51.394 --> 01:23:54.022
You weren't there
in Kansas, Lil.

01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:02.071
It was the worst time
in my life,

01:24:02.155 --> 01:24:04.741
and I came out here
a failure.

01:24:04.824 --> 01:24:08.077
I don't want that
to happen again.

01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:13.958
You will never be a failure.

If you give up, you're
giving up on all of us.

It must be very tiring for you,
working all these long hours.

01:24:49.953 --> 01:24:54.582
And for so little money.

What's this?

01:26:21.836 --> 01:26:23.046
It's a letter
from Charles Mintz

01:26:23.129 --> 01:26:24.964
with a deal requesting
your presence in New York.

01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:31.888

all he wants to in a wire,

but if you're there
in person...

01:26:40.355 --> 01:26:42.732
I think maybe he'll back down.

01:26:42.815 --> 01:26:44.442
And he'll back down
even if I'm not there.

I have, uh,

Ah, just to insure

01:28:29.631 --> 01:28:32.717
that we don't sacrifice
the quality of the animations.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.303
Ah, what do you have in mind?

01:28:35.386 --> 01:28:38.640
Well, for starters, we need
$2,500 per short...

Look, the more
I review the numbers,

01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:06.167
the less I'm inclined to spend.

01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:05.268
I could go directly
to the studio...

01:30:05.351 --> 01:30:09.939
and make a deal with them
myself... bypass Winkler.

01:30:10.023 --> 01:30:11.191

01:30:11.274 --> 01:30:13.318

01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:46.267
and now with Oswald the Rabbit.

01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:51.272
At this time, we'd like to
partner directly with MGM...

01:30:51.356 --> 01:30:54.359

our future animations.

01:30:55.777 --> 01:30:58.321
Walter, we love Oswald...

01:30:58.404 --> 01:31:00.865
but, everyone in town knows

01:31:00.949 --> 01:31:03.785
that the rights
belong to Mintz...

01:31:03.868 --> 01:31:06.746

to release another cartoon

01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:08.748

I think of the work you do.

You of all people know
it takes time to get ahead.

01:31:44.033 --> 01:31:46.536
Yeah, well, this is different.

01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:48.496
Charles and George have made me

01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.082
the new director of animation
for their studio.

they are both already

01:32:15.356 --> 01:32:18.943
Walt and Roy treated you

01:32:35.585 --> 01:32:38.004
So much potential.

01:32:41.633 --> 01:32:44.302
Mr. Goldstein,
I feel that it's time

01:32:44.385 --> 01:32:46.721
I started working directly
with Universal.

01:32:46.804 --> 01:32:50.725
We just signed a three-year
deal with Mintz. You know that.

01:32:50.808 --> 01:32:53.478
There's little room for us
to maneuver with him in there.

01:32:53.561 --> 01:32:55.522
But you pay Charles for Oswald.

01:32:55.605 --> 01:32:57.857
Isn't there some way
you can intervene?

01:32:57.941 --> 01:33:01.319
If you could just hold on
for a year.

01:33:01.402 --> 01:33:03.488
Hold on?

01:33:03.571 --> 01:33:06.199
Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Laemmle
from Universal Studios

01:33:06.282 --> 01:33:08.284
is on the line.

01:33:08.368 --> 01:33:11.120
