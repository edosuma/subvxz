looks fucking stupid.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.084

to do it themselves,

07:40.160 --> 07:41.924

their own hair.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.970
If your barber's got a good haircut,
you'd want to ask him where he's going.

Look how I struggled
today, ?ogging fish.

34:34.719 --> 34:37.246
Look how difficult, look what you
got to do to get people to have fish.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.281
Maybe later.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.525
Why? What's the rush?

34:43.159 --> 34:44.764
Well, that's why it
should be in a fridge.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.489
It's not about killing me.
I just don't like sushi.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.402
I don't wanna kiss fish.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.806
What sort of night is this?
I thought it was a classy joint.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.929
12 hours on a plane.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.288
Over 5000 miles, ail this way.
You got me licking fish.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.122
Not at this... Not...
I don't wanna do it.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.441
Fucking hell.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.641
- Is it a good earner?
- Yeah.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.291
- What are the hours like?
- Well, it depends.

35:29.640 --> 35:33.690
Any perks? Do you get to take
home what hasn't been eaten or...

35:33.960 --> 35:35.325
(LAUGHING)

35:35.400 --> 35:37.767
Don't laugh. You're gonna lose a bit.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.401
It is weird how it's,
sort of, come to that.

35:41.480 --> 35:45.883
I don't know if it's because now there's
too many people in the world

35:45.960 --> 35:47.928
and they've just got to come up
with more and more jobs

35:48.000 --> 35:49.126
'cause the population's

35:49.200 --> 35:50.361
just mental, isn't it?

35:50.440 --> 35:53.967
That's why you got women lying down,
food all over them,

35:54.040 --> 35:55.246
all you can eat buffet.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.527
Because all the normal jobs
have been taken up.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.364
<i>The national lottery on the telly.</i>

35:59.440 --> 36:01.886
<i>Like three people to select six balls.</i>

36:02.960 --> 36:05.247
So unnecessary.
You got a bloke there with a clipboard,

36:05.320 --> 36:09.006
a fella with a white glove and a bloke
to hit the button on the machine.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.730
Three people to select six numbers.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.645
<i>The world's gone mental.</i>

36:14.280 --> 36:18.285
In terms of vocation and different
jobs in the world, it is a job.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.724
Sort of better than sitting on your arse
but she is sitting on her arse.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.531
But she's being paid for it. That's what
I said at the start of the day.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.281
<i>And that's what we all
want really, isn't it?</i>

36:30.640 --> 36:32.722
I just didn't wanna lick the fish.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.929
So, what I want to see today is,
you know,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.526
this whole thing of coming
to America and living the dream

37:00.600 --> 37:03.206
<i>and doing whatever job you want to do.</i>

37:03.960 --> 37:05.724
I want to see if that is true.

37:07.640 --> 37:12.123
I want to look at a job that, in a way,
I know, deep down, I'm not cut out for

37:12.240 --> 37:14.641
and I wanna see how
I'd get on at doing that job.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.449
<i>BEN'. So what are you gonna do?</i>

37:17.040 --> 37:18.565
I'm gonna have a go at...

37:18.640 --> 37:20.130
being a model.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.530
Like a proper... Proper model.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.409
I don't mean like
the modelling I did in japan.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.926
The Benriya thing.
Sort of half nude modelling.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.810
I'm talking catwalk model.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.922
That is a job, innit, that...

37:34.840 --> 37:36.251
it doesn't matter how much
you wanna do it,

37:36.320 --> 37:37.401
if you haven't got the look,

37:38.880 --> 37:40.006
they're not gonna let you do it.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.405
So what' ll happen is,
she'll come out...

37:46.720 --> 37:49.041
Boom. Walk.

37:49.880 --> 37:53.680
That's what I'm talking about. Ow, ow!

37:53.760 --> 37:57.128
We're making them all walk
right now and we'll see timing.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.965
We'll see how they're going
about it and then we'll put you

38:00.040 --> 38:02.691
into the mix towards the end
and you can test it out.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.567
Click, click, click, click
click, click, click!

38:13.600 --> 38:15.967
- So, don't smile, then?
- Not smiling.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.724
- Just... just...
- But you're not scowling either.

38:17.800 --> 38:22.089
So, how would you describe that to me,
how to do that face? What is it?

38:22.960 --> 38:25.691
I tell them to think about
smiling without smiling.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.729
- Smile without smiling.
-(CHUCKLES) Think about it.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.927
No caveman. Keep it upright.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.850
-Your mouth doesn't need to be open.
-(STUTTERS) It always is.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.684
Keep your arms simple.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.202
So, remember you're a half step
in front of her.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.164
No over swinging. Relax.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.483
- It looks like you're furring a, like...
- Ah!

38:56.560 --> 38:59.689
- Try not to swing your arms so much.
- All right.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.082
Would you give me a gig? With that head?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.486
Probably not.
I probably wouldn't book you.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.724
- Gets a little monkey.
- A little bit monkey.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.366
<i>He's saying go out and be confident.</i>

39:08.440 --> 39:09.885
How can I be confident
when he just said that?

39:09.960 --> 39:11.724
You got arms of a monkey.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.485
Why say that? If he wants me
to walk out there tonight

39:14.560 --> 39:18.201
really like confident,
I've got that going around my head.

39:18.280 --> 39:21.489
I've got arms of a monkey.
Cheers. Brilliant.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.447
If I nailed this walk...

39:24.520 --> 39:28.411
Why is this bit so important to you?
If they should be looking at that bit.

39:28.480 --> 39:31.051
You are creating...

39:31.920 --> 39:33.843
something beyond for these people...

39:33.920 --> 39:37.208
And if you present it in such a way
that's like, I want to wear that...

39:37.280 --> 39:39.442
I wanna feel like that.
I wanna be like that.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.761
But I'm never gonna be like that.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.686
I've got a fat head. There's nothing
I can do about it. It's not my fault.

39:45.760 --> 39:49.446
I can do nothing about this.
This was created by me mam and dad.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.045
I've done nothing towards this.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.725
<i>Even if! wanted
to have a thinner head...</i>

39:52.800 --> 39:55.326
<i>Say, if! really, really
wanted to be a model,</i>

39:55.400 --> 39:57.368
<i>how do you go about
losing weight off your head?</i>

39:57.920 --> 39:59.763
No one's ever brought out a DVD.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.251
"Have you got a fat head?

40:01.320 --> 40:04.563
"Do the workout."
What do you do? All this here.

40:05.080 --> 40:08.004
That's Twix and lemon muffins.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.645
What workout?

40:10.120 --> 40:11.531
What can you do?

40:12.640 --> 40:14.483
<i>By the end of the day,
he didn't like it, did he?</i>

40:14.560 --> 40:16.961
It was sort of saying he just...
"I wouldn't book you."

40:17.040 --> 40:19.566
Those were his words.
"I wouldn't book you."

40:20.120 --> 40:22.600
So there you go.
So if I wanted to be a model,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.051
I couldn't be a model.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.287
<i>So, you know, sometimes,
there's no point chasing your dreams.</i>

40:35.440 --> 40:37.647
(IN DISTINCT TALKIN G)

40:50.920 --> 40:52.684
- BEN: What's wrong with the crotch?
- I don't know.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.127
I don't know why that's...

40:55.200 --> 40:57.089
I mean, for me, it's handy.
They're all laughing in there,

40:57.160 --> 40:58.969
saying "Oh, you're a bit old
to be a model."

40:59.040 --> 41:02.283
I'm 40.1% you get older,
your balls drop. Right?

41:02.360 --> 41:05.887
If there's one man in there who
should be wearing these pants, it is me.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.128
Honestly, I'm touching cloth there.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.290
Oh, my gosh! It's amazing.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.567
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That's awesome.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.001
Yes!

41:21.480 --> 41:23.847
- Really?
- So good.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.766
- So good?
- Yeah. It really is.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.761
So would you give me a job or...

41:31.040 --> 41:33.441
You... I'm going
to let you look in a mirror.

41:33.520 --> 41:36.524
- That's really slick.
- It's sharp. Oh, my gosh.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.250
Okay. Yes.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.800
- What, are you happy then?
- I'm really excited.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.730
Can you just step back
to the dressing room and walk?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.561
- Yeah, we're golden. We're golden.
- Oh, my gosh, yes.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.527
<i>Initially, he wasn't convinced.</i>

42:09.760 --> 42:12.366
Suddenly, I've put his suit on,
he's over the moon.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.323
I finished the walk.
He was happy with it.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.447
He was going, "You rocked it."

42:20.760 --> 42:22.171
(APPLAUDING)

42:27.880 --> 42:30.724
- Congratulations!
- Yeah! We did it!

42:30.800 --> 42:33.326
- It was beautiful.
- Thank you, thank you so much.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.050
- Happy, josh?
- WOMAN: I'm so proud of you.

42:35.120 --> 42:39.011
Yes! It was so good. I saw you walking
down and I was like, "He did it."

42:39.080 --> 42:42.084
He did it. He learned and then...
Thanks to everybody.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.286
Seriously, good job.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.124
(APPLAUDING)

42:45.200 --> 42:46.361
Good one. Thanks to everyone.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.925
I had no idea I could do this as a job.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.849
It wasn't even in me head
before we started this trip.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.684
Being a model.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.689
So...

42:59.200 --> 43:02.329
What have I learned?
I've just learned that you've...

43:02.400 --> 43:04.084
Give anything a go.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.522
If an opportunity comes along,
give it a go, 'cause you never know.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.162
<i>When I was in Cape Town and I met Pam,</i>

43:14.240 --> 43:16.925
<i>the sushi girl, I had never
heard of that job before.</i>

43:17.520 --> 43:18.931
Not everybody likes fish.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.089
So I've opened it up.
Like a... It's the Buffetman.
