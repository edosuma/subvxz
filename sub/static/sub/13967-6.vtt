- Oh, hello, Dr. Pavlov.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.350

(Sammy)<i> Someone has
to watch her 24/7.</i>

00:24.530 --> 00:26.950
- I need to go get better.
- How long will you be gone?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.720
(Molly)<i> I don't know.</i>

00:28.720 --> 00:30.190
You are Bassam's son.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.560
He doesn't know.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.330
<i> Promise me you won't</i>
<i> tell him, Ahmed.</i>

00:35.330 --> 00:37.130
Where were you this morning?
I couldn't find you.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.070
(Sammy) You're sleeping with me

00:39.070 --> 00:40.800
'cause I'm the President's son?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.500
Don't you read my blog?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.340
You're criticizing him.

00:44.340 --> 00:46.070
(Halima)<i> Are you sleeping
with him?</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.110
Everything we care about
is too important!

00:48.110 --> 00:50.340
I don't want to have
to tell your father.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.210
We just got a warning
about more bombings.

00:52.210 --> 00:53.710
Some people are
talking about leaving,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.320
crossing the border
into Abuddin.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.550
We can make a better life
for you here, brother.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.590
You really think
that four months from now,

00:59.590 --> 01:02.060
when Fauzi is President
and you are nothing,

01:02.060 --> 01:04.060
<i> that he will still be</i>
<i> interested in you?</i>

01:04.060 --> 01:05.730
Are you going to leave me?

01:05.730 --> 01:08.400
I'm never leaving you again.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.760
Kill the infidel in the street.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.830
(gunshot)

01:10.830 --> 01:12.330
(Cogswell) These guys
are real pros.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.000
The thing's working, too.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.100
<i> Conservative Islamist students</i>
<i> radicalized by this shit.</i>

01:17.110 --> 01:18.640
Mahdiya?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.710
(gunshot)
Kill them all.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.850
One by one.

01:24.850 --> 01:25.280
What do we know

01:25.280 --> 01:26.910
<i> about Daliyah Al-Yazbek?</i>

01:26.910 --> 01:29.250
- (Aziz)<i> They seem close. </i>
- Bassam...

01:31.690 --> 01:33.690
(low hum of chat)
(traffic noise)

01:33.690 --> 01:34.920
ID, please.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.160
(horn honks)

01:39.060 --> 01:41.360
- Do you know Bruno Mars?
- What?

01:41.360 --> 01:43.930
He is my
favorite singer. (chuckles)

01:43.930 --> 01:45.870
I'm from Akron, Ohio.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.800
Bruno Mars doesn't
hang out there much.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.300
Oh.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.340
Will you take
a selfie with me?

01:56.140 --> 01:58.650
Yeah, but do it quick,
before my C.O. notices.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.650
(men chatting in distance)

02:05.090 --> 02:07.090

02:07.090 --> 02:08.759

Oh!

02:08.759 --> 02:10.259

02:10.259 --> 02:11.690

(overlapping screaming)

02:27.060 --> 02:29.760
(footsteps approaching)

02:30.180 --> 02:32.210
May I?

02:34.150 --> 02:36.220
Help yourself.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.590
Sammy still sleeping?

02:44.590 --> 02:45.430
I don't know.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.430
He, um...

02:47.430 --> 02:49.930
He doesn't come down to
breakfast much these days.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.070
How are you, Ahmed?

03:00.210 --> 03:02.280
I'm okay.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.450
I know that I haven't
exactly been, uh...

03:05.450 --> 03:08.020
available to you.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.220
Or Sammy or...
anyone, really.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.220
No one blames you.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.560
You have more than enough
on your plate.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.890
(takes a deep breath)

03:19.890 --> 03:22.530
I was thinking that...

03:22.530 --> 03:24.900
maybe it's time we should

03:24.900 --> 03:27.030
bury Nusrat
with the rest of the family.

03:29.870 --> 03:32.070
If you'd like that.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.870
You know I would,
but my mother, she...

03:33.870 --> 03:37.480
We have a private plot.
It would be a private ceremony.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.880
Thank you.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.520
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. President.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.590
You're needed
in the war room.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.590
(chair scrapes)

03:50.090 --> 03:51.690
(Cogswell)<i> Well, I'm afraid</i>

03:51.690 --> 03:53.290
that this is
the new normal.

03:53.290 --> 03:55.230
Constant,
low-level violence.

03:55.230 --> 03:56.600
I agree.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.200
That's ten separate attacks
in the last two weeks,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.540
starting with the assassination
of Sheik Taymullah.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.500
They are still using it
as a rallying cry.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.810
Take a look.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.100
(remoter clicks)

04:20.890 --> 04:23.560
(Leila) Wait. Go back.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.790
Who's that?

04:24.790 --> 04:27.230
(Maloof) Professor Haitham El-Amin.

04:27.230 --> 04:29.600
Teaches political philosophy
at the university.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.400
He's part of a new generation

04:31.400 --> 04:33.670
of anti-government
bloggers.

04:33.670 --> 04:36.770
There's dozens of them, but
this guy's the most influential.

04:36.770 --> 04:39.310
The Caliphate reprints him
every chance they get.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.910
I wonder if he knows
how much damage he's doing.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.380
There has been some chatter
about something bigger planned,

04:45.380 --> 04:47.380
but we don't know where
and we don't know when.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.220
At least not yet.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.150
I need better than that,
General.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.920
Yup.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.220
So does Europe.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.590
So does the United States.

04:56.590 --> 05:01.960
You are our most important
recruits.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.560
Because you're native
Abuddinians.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.500
And when we march
back into Abuddin,

05:07.500 --> 05:09.970
you will march
in the front with me.

05:13.570 --> 05:15.310
You.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.180
How can you serve
the Caliphate?

05:21.150 --> 05:23.920
I give everything I have.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.420
I give my life to serve Sheik
Abdullah in the fight for Islam.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.090
Hmm.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.590
(claps hands)

05:40.940 --> 05:42.340
And you?

05:42.340 --> 05:45.140
How can you serve
the Caliphate?

05:45.140 --> 05:47.270
I give everything I have.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.610
I give my life
to serve Sheik Abdullah

05:49.610 --> 05:51.180
in the fight for Islam.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.780
Really?

05:56.820 --> 05:58.550
You don't want
a family?

05:58.550 --> 06:00.450
A rich husband
who takes you

06:00.460 --> 06:04.160
on shopping trips
to Dubai, Paris?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.630
I give everything.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.100
Good.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.210
(Sammy) Your kids made these?

06:18.210 --> 06:19.570
My wife.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.440
She's not very talented.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.780
My sons.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.820
Do you love your wife?

06:31.650 --> 06:34.020
You've had sex
with her twice.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.420
At least.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.860
I do love her.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.590
The sex... not so much.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.730
She know?

06:42.730 --> 06:44.400
About you? No.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.070
About you.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.570
I hide all the time.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.810
All of us do,
in this culture.

06:56.840 --> 07:01.380
We live in here one way,
and we say something else.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.450
Or nothing at all.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.560
You're the first man I have
ever met who doesn't have shame.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.630
You have no idea
how exciting that is.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.670
How sexy that is.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.670
(light smooching)

07:32.000 --> 07:34.450
(Barry) This is from the, uh...

07:34.450 --> 07:37.050
Raid in the camp.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.730
I really have to go.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.670
Mmm.

07:55.670 --> 07:58.100
Five more minutes.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.370
What can I do
in five minutes?

08:02.810 --> 08:05.510
(laughs) Don't answer that.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.750
(sighs)

08:23.030 --> 08:25.230
I picture you like this...

08:27.670 --> 08:29.540
during the day, sometimes.

08:31.470 --> 08:35.710
I close my eyes,
and I see you here in this room.

08:37.549 --> 08:42.150
This is the only place
where the world just...

08:42.150 --> 08:43.780
stops for me.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.890
♪♪

09:12.250 --> 09:14.710
Five minutes.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.420
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.420
I didn't... Were you
waiting for me?

09:22.420 --> 09:26.160
I... I had a break
in my schedule, so...

09:26.160 --> 09:28.600
I've been so busy
the last couple of weeks,

09:28.600 --> 09:30.830
I haven't seen you.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.100
I... I left you
a couple of messages.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.540
I know. I'm sorry.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.600
I've been so busy, too.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.840
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

09:39.840 --> 09:43.040
Uh... H... How's Ghani?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.510
Oh, he's...
he's all right.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.250
Actually,
I think he's having

09:49.250 --> 09:53.390
a little bit of a hard time
at school right now.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.890
You know how children are
at this age.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.960
They can be so cruel
sometimes.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.330
And part of me wants
to do something about it.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.100
Part of me thinks that,
you know what,

10:02.100 --> 10:03.860
life can be cruel
sometimes, too,

10:03.870 --> 10:05.770
- and maybe he should just learn to...
- Marry me.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.730
Sorry?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.370
I... I want you to marry me.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.410
(stammering) I know it's a crazy
thing to ask,

10:12.410 --> 10:15.580
and this is not the
right place or time,

10:15.580 --> 10:17.380
but there's never really
a right time or place

10:17.380 --> 10:18.850
for anything these days.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.480
(laughs)

10:23.490 --> 10:25.520
I...

10:26.820 --> 10:29.090
I don't know what to...

10:29.090 --> 10:32.630
Daliyah...

10:32.630 --> 10:35.830
you're a widow in a culture
that's not very good to widows.

10:35.830 --> 10:39.170
You have a son who
could use a father.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.440
And I'm tired of being lonely.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.070
Listen.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.910
I don't really know how
I feel about being president.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.980
I've never really wanted
to be in charge.

10:53.910 --> 10:56.250
But if you were
my First Lady...

10:59.650 --> 11:02.520
I know it sounds
a little impractical.

11:04.460 --> 11:08.130
And, well, obviously
I can't speak for you, but...

11:08.130 --> 11:10.960
for myself...

11:10.970 --> 11:13.030
I have no doubt
I'm falling in love.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.740
You think I'm crazy.

11:24.550 --> 11:28.450
I was someone's
second wife, Fauzi.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.420
I was nobody.

11:32.490 --> 11:37.220
And now, God knows how,

11:37.230 --> 11:40.690
I'm a substantial person.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.230
Because of my work.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.900
You would be
my equal partner.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.740
And the most important woman
in the country.

11:51.740 --> 11:56.880
Daliyah, for all the good
you can do here,

11:56.880 --> 12:00.250
we could do
so much more good together.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.250
Just think about it.

12:04.780 --> 12:06.790
Promise me
you'll think about it.

12:06.790 --> 12:09.790
(indistinct chatter)

12:26.410 --> 12:28.480
(indistinct chatter)

12:28.480 --> 12:32.480
(metal detectors chirp)

12:41.080 --> 12:43.080
(zips bag)

12:46.130 --> 12:48.390
(exhales)

12:48.400 --> 12:50.630
So thank you all
for joining us...

12:50.630 --> 12:52.370
(clears throat)

12:58.570 --> 13:00.970
(over speakers) Thank you all
for joining us today.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.910
We've added a dozen testimonies
for this session,

13:03.910 --> 13:07.250
so we will be going
a little bit later tonight.

13:07.250 --> 13:12.090
Our first testimony
is from Mr. Nizar Kassem.

13:12.090 --> 13:15.790
Mr. Kassem is a music teacher
from Asima

13:15.790 --> 13:17.890
who spent seven years
in prison

13:17.890 --> 13:20.890
under the regime of
Jamal and Khaled Al Fayeed.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.560
(automatic gunfire)
(people screaming)

13:35.080 --> 13:37.180
(gunfire continues)

13:40.110 --> 13:42.520
(people crying, screaming)

13:42.520 --> 13:44.580
(gunfire continues)

13:46.150 --> 13:48.760
(woman) I beg of you,
I beg of you!

13:48.760 --> 13:50.160
(man) Please, please, please!

13:50.160 --> 13:52.230
(gunshot)

Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

15:10.540 --> 15:13.110
(line ringing)

15:13.110 --> 15:15.510
(Daliyah recorded) This is
Daliyah Al...

15:15.510 --> 15:17.680
(line ringing)

15:17.680 --> 15:20.150
This is Daliyah Al-Yazbek.
Please... (phone beeps)

15:22.050 --> 15:23.550
(line ringing)

15:23.550 --> 15:24.780
(quiet chatter)

15:24.790 --> 15:26.420
I need a list of the victims.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.650
We're still
gathering information.

15:27.650 --> 15:30.190
- We've confirmed 19 casualties so far...
- I need names!

15:30.190 --> 15:31.890
Sir, this has only
just happened. Many of...

15:31.890 --> 15:33.590
Tell me who you've
got on the ground,

15:33.600 --> 15:34.890
and I'll call
them myself!

15:34.900 --> 15:36.830
(Maloof) I'll get you
a status report

15:36.830 --> 15:38.200
the moment it's available.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.470
In the meantime,
I need you

15:39.470 --> 15:41.300
to authorize an operation
in Ma'an.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.600
What operation?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.840
The General wants to arrest
half the population.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.680
I want to preempt
any further attacks.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.710
(phone ringing)
We'd only be arresting people

15:48.710 --> 15:50.710
on the watch list.

15:52.610 --> 15:54.150
(pants) Yes?

15:54.150 --> 15:55.420
(Daliyah) Bassam.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.880
(sighs) Daliyah.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.150
I wanted to call you sooner,
but they said

15:59.150 --> 16:01.290
we couldn't.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.920
(sniffling)

16:03.930 --> 16:05.990
Ziyad is dead.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.990
(sobs)

16:08.200 --> 16:11.260
They were
firing their guns and...

16:11.270 --> 16:13.470
he covered me with his body.

16:13.470 --> 16:16.800
Okay. Listen, I'll be down as
soon as I can get there, okay?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.400
Daliyah?

16:18.410 --> 16:19.710
I'm here.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.410
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:23.410 --> 16:26.580
They're taking me
to the hospital.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.110
Are you hurt?

16:28.120 --> 16:30.620
No, just a cut.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.820
Okay. I'll meet you
at the hospital.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.260
No. You should be
at the Palace.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.690
I'll be fine.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.530
I'll see you soon.
(phone beeps)

16:40.490 --> 16:43.200
Daliyah...

16:43.200 --> 16:44.860
Daliyah?

16:53.470 --> 16:54.710
Daliyah.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.440
(sighs) Thank God.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.950
What...
I don't know what else to say.

16:59.950 --> 17:02.150
I'm all right.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.520
It's not my blood.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.180
(paramedic) The transport's ready.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.849
- All right.
- I'm not... It's not my blood.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.460
Daliyah...

17:11.829 --> 17:14.329
Hey.

17:14.329 --> 17:16.560
(sniffles) They want to take me
to the hospital.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.970
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll come with you.

17:22.940 --> 17:25.510
This cowardly attack on
the Truth and Dignity Commission

17:25.510 --> 17:26.910
threatens all of us.

17:26.910 --> 17:28.670
As interim President,
I am determined

17:28.680 --> 17:31.310
that the people of Abuddin
will never again

17:31.310 --> 17:33.150
be held hostage by fear.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.280
And therefore, I've authorized
our security forces

17:35.280 --> 17:37.580
<i>- to arrest anyone and everyone </i>
- (soldiers shouting)

17:37.590 --> 17:40.250
<i> who has collaborated</i>
<i> with terrorists.</i>

17:40.260 --> 17:41.850
<i> We cannot allow this country</i>

17:41.860 --> 17:43.760
<i> that we've worked</i>
<i> so hard to build</i>

17:43.760 --> 17:45.390
to be undermined
by the actions of

17:45.390 --> 17:47.530
a violent,
misguided minority.

17:47.530 --> 17:51.700
Know that I will do everything
in my power to protect you

17:51.700 --> 17:54.270
from these enemies of peace
inside our borders.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.000
It's happening.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.340
- Just like I said it would.
- (Bassam's speech continues on TV)

17:59.340 --> 18:01.270
How soon before
they come for you and me?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.480
Before they turn
the gas on us again?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.280
(on TV) They were murdered...

18:07.280 --> 18:09.680
(TV clicks off)

18:09.680 --> 18:11.780
I want to see Ihab.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.290
Face-to-face.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.090
You're finally
waking up to the truth.

18:17.090 --> 18:19.460
Just call him and tell him
I want to see him.

18:21.060 --> 18:24.230
These people are cowards

18:24.230 --> 18:28.030
who brought rifles and bullets
into a place of forgiveness.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.400
But they will not succeed.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.310
And we will not be made afraid.

18:33.310 --> 18:36.040
The Truth and Dignity Commission
will resume immediately,

18:36.040 --> 18:37.640
and when it does,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.650
I'll be on the stand
as its first witness.

18:40.650 --> 18:44.050
(crowd murmuring)
(camera shutters clicking)

18:50.620 --> 18:52.430
If anyone asks,

18:52.430 --> 18:54.790
I've gone to see
my sister in Amman, okay?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.900
Okay.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.670
Don't be so nervous,<i> habibi.</i>

19:00.670 --> 19:02.570
You're doing the right thing.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.910
I don't know if I am.

19:05.910 --> 19:09.580
We've known the bin Rashids
for a very long time.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.610
You were always
meant to be allies,

19:11.610 --> 19:13.680
you and Ihab.

19:20.690 --> 19:25.690
♪♪

19:30.800 --> 19:32.400
<i> (knocking on door)</i>

19:37.940 --> 19:39.540
(whispers) Bassam.

19:41.540 --> 19:44.540
(Bassam sighing)

19:44.810 --> 19:46.880
(crying softly)

19:46.880 --> 19:51.120
I won't let them get away
with this, I promise.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.020
I'll kill them all if I have to.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.690
(sniffles) What?

20:00.830 --> 20:02.530
No, I don't...

20:04.530 --> 20:07.770
No, no more talk
about killing.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.640
Don't kill anyone
for me, please.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.970
I'm so tired of all the killing.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.140
Bassam...

20:14.140 --> 20:15.340
Shh, shh, shh.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.980
(sobs)

20:18.750 --> 20:20.810
(sighs)

20:31.160 --> 20:33.160
(crowd chattering)
(horns honking)

20:33.160 --> 20:34.390
Latif Al-Qadi.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.000
Why do you smile?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.430
It's been a long wait.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.370
My family appreciates

20:39.370 --> 20:42.200
everything you've provided
for us, but a camp is a camp,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.670
and we're eager
to join our relatives.

20:43.670 --> 20:46.010
Application for refugee status
has been denied.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.040
- Why?
- Perhaps you heard about the massacre

20:48.040 --> 20:49.280
at the Truth and Dignity
Commission?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.240
Yes, it's awful.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.180
I'm not a supporter
of the Caliphate.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.350
We've been their victims, too.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.710
They're the reason
we left Syria.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.950
Maybe.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.150
Your brother, the sheik,

20:57.150 --> 20:58.690
has given comfort to those
who support him.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.550
Doesn't sound like my brother.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.420
But... I'm not
a political person.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.860
I'm a museum curator.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.730
I'm just looking for
a new home for my family.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.730
Understand my problem.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.900
Everyone looks the same.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.860
A housewife stabs a soldier.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.930
A medical student
straps on a suicide bomb

21:13.940 --> 21:15.570
and walks into a market.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.100
Maybe a museum curator, too.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.870
Al-Qadis are trouble

21:18.870 --> 21:20.710
for this country.
I'm sending you back to Syria.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.540
Well, you can't.
The U.N. forbids

21:22.540 --> 21:24.310
sending refugees
back into conflict regions.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.780
You don't want to go back? Fine.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.980
Welcome to your
new permanent home.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.280
Make yourself comfortable. Next.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.990
Sheik Al-Qadi is missing.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.960
I need to get
back to the Palace.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.500
Is there anything else
we needed to discuss?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.570
Your statement on

21:45.570 --> 21:47.530
the Truth and Dignity
Commission played well.

21:47.530 --> 21:50.000
- That's not why I did it.
- Nevertheless,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.310
this violence is taking its toll
on Bassam's support.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.670
Meaning what?

21:54.680 --> 21:57.780
All this news is worse for Fauzi
than it is for you.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.080
He's Bassam's chosen man.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.010
He rises and falls
with the President.

22:01.010 --> 22:02.120
You, on the other hand...

22:02.120 --> 22:04.280
On the other hand, nothing.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.620
I'm his Foreign Secretary.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.920
Unless you resign.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.990
Give yourself a chance to
criticize the government.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.060
And the Americans.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.160
Unhook yourself from Bassam.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.590
Mr. Kipfer, I'm an Abuddinian
before I'm a candidate.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.530
- (children laugh playfully)
- (Safiya) Hey! Sit down!

22:17.530 --> 22:20.000
Or no dessert tonight!

22:20.000 --> 22:22.100
Sorry, Leila.
They're monsters.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.600
They're children. It's okay.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.170
I'll just make sure
it doesn't stain.

22:33.180 --> 22:34.450
Here. Let me get that.

22:34.450 --> 22:36.450
It's okay.
It's okay.

22:37.780 --> 22:39.090
(sighs)

22:40.790 --> 22:42.690
Why did you say no to him?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.630
Really? You don't understand?

22:45.630 --> 22:48.530
I wonder.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.860
Was it because you don't
want to criticize Bassam,

22:50.870 --> 22:53.600
or because you don't want
to criticize the Americans?

22:55.570 --> 22:58.300
I'm not having
this discussion with you again.

23:03.010 --> 23:05.580
So you are still
seeing him, aren't you?

23:05.580 --> 23:07.110
You are wrong, Safiya.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.650
We're in love with each other.

23:08.650 --> 23:10.150
Great.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.880
Much better.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.190
Love wouldn't
cloud your judgment.

23:14.190 --> 23:16.090
Do you have any idea
what happens to you,

23:16.090 --> 23:17.560
or this country
or this election,

23:17.560 --> 23:19.460
if anyone finds out?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.230
What do those who call Bassam
an American call you, then?

23:25.230 --> 23:27.330
Everything there is, Safiya.

23:27.340 --> 23:28.430
Everything.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.270
People die
without warning.

23:30.270 --> 23:31.400
Shot to hell

23:31.410 --> 23:32.410
on a random day

23:32.410 --> 23:35.210
by people they don't know,
and for no reason.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.980
That's the world we live in.

23:39.050 --> 23:42.680
I'm in love for the first time
in 25 years.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.790
It's a risk
I'm willing to take.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.780
(indistinct chattering)

24:08.780 --> 24:11.440
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.980
I'm Kamilah Al-Qadi.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.680
Can we talk
in private, please?

24:23.660 --> 24:25.390
It's important.
I know it is.

24:25.390 --> 24:26.660
My father took it

24:26.660 --> 24:28.230
from the National
Archaeological Museum

24:28.230 --> 24:29.830
when we left Damascus.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.530
I thought maybe you would
reconsider your decision.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.940
Please.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.410
You can't keep us here forever.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.570
It's... It's terrible here.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.610
Go home to your family.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.650
You're going to let us out?

24:46.650 --> 24:47.780
No.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.080
We don't allow smugglers
into this country.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.220
Thank you for this.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.520
I'll see that
it's taken care of.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.890
No, please,
you can't do that.

24:54.890 --> 24:55.990
My father will kill me.

24:55.990 --> 24:56.990
Please, give it back to me.

24:56.990 --> 24:57.790
I'm begging you!

24:57.790 --> 24:59.260
Go home to your family.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.490
Wait!

25:00.500 --> 25:01.760
Wait!

25:03.130 --> 25:04.800
What... What
else can I do?

25:04.800 --> 25:05.830
I have other

25:05.830 --> 25:06.700
- things to offer.
- Stop it.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.270
I can... I can...

25:08.270 --> 25:10.240
Stop it!

25:10.240 --> 25:13.240
(children and men chat from the camp)

25:15.840 --> 25:18.840
There are worse degradations
than living in a camp.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.880
Go home to your family.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.580
You want to talk about this?
How about you talk to me?

25:49.580 --> 25:52.510
So you can at least pretend that
I have a say in my own life!

25:52.510 --> 25:54.910
What are you talking about?

25:54.920 --> 25:58.420
Now, I don't know what Halima
told you about the two of us,

25:58.420 --> 26:01.190
but I don't need your permission
about who I sleep with.

26:01.190 --> 26:02.890
The two of who?

26:02.890 --> 26:04.260
Excuse me?

26:05.990 --> 26:09.060
Oh, shit. Shit.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.100
(sighs)

26:15.900 --> 26:18.240
You're sleeping
with Professor El-Amin.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.280
Sammy, he was here
because he's been writing blogs

26:24.280 --> 26:26.880
about me being responsible
for the violence in Abuddin.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.050
Did you know that?

26:28.050 --> 26:29.520
Yes.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.390
(scoffs)

26:33.390 --> 26:35.350
That's who you choose
to sleep with?

26:38.220 --> 26:40.890
You know what,
I changed my mind.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.800
I don't want to talk
about this with you.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.200
Sammy, I know who you are.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.070
I'm not asking you
to be anyone else.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.370
But I need you to think
about how dangerous it is,

26:48.370 --> 26:50.770
for all of us, for you
to be sleeping with a man...

26:50.770 --> 26:53.770
that man... at this time.

26:54.770 --> 26:57.770
(breathing anxiously)

26:58.910 --> 27:01.380
I'm sorry. Is it...
Is it messy?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.920
Is it messy for you?

27:05.920 --> 27:07.920
Is it messier than
you sleeping with Daliyah

27:07.920 --> 27:11.420
when Mom is in treatment?

27:11.430 --> 27:14.360
You think I don't know where you
sneak off to every other day?

27:20.300 --> 27:22.370
Family's a screwed-up thing,
isn't it?

27:26.110 --> 27:27.640
Democracy, too.

27:33.850 --> 27:36.650
(door opens)

27:36.650 --> 27:38.520
(sighs)

27:43.590 --> 27:46.630
So, you really want
to be president?

27:46.630 --> 27:48.330
That's not funny.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.800
And if these attacks
and your reprisals

27:50.800 --> 27:53.700
continue much longer,
I may not be.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.100
I'm paying a very steep
price for defending you.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.740
What other choice do I have?

28:03.980 --> 28:05.980
Three months ago,
the people would have carried me

28:05.980 --> 28:08.010
on their shoulders
to the capitol.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.750
Now I can't please anyone.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.450
(water sloshes)

28:11.450 --> 28:13.490
I promised a new Abuddin.

28:13.490 --> 28:16.290
All I've delivered
is the same old war.

28:16.290 --> 28:19.730
Daliyah looked at me yesterday
and asked me not to kill

28:19.730 --> 28:21.290
any more people,
not in her name,

28:21.290 --> 28:23.260
but tell me,
what else can I do?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.470
I asked her
to marry me.

28:34.970 --> 28:36.710
Who?

28:36.710 --> 28:39.340
Daliyah.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.710
I popped the
question yesterday,

28:41.720 --> 28:44.050
right before
the attacks.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.320
I asked her to be
my first lady.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.530
(clears throat)

28:53.530 --> 28:55.330
(water splashes)

28:55.330 --> 28:57.000
Um... Wow.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.470
Where did, uh,
where did this come from?

29:05.070 --> 29:07.470
I'm in love with her,
as it turns out.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.550
You'd probably feel the same
thing if you weren't married.

29:13.550 --> 29:14.980
Anyone would.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.880
So, did she, um...

29:18.890 --> 29:20.720
What did she say?

29:20.720 --> 29:24.060
Well, she didn't say yes.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.960
She's gonna think about it.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.690
I think.

29:28.690 --> 29:31.690
(exhaling deeply)

29:32.130 --> 29:34.970
I don't know... you know
her better than anyone.

29:34.970 --> 29:38.500
Am I foolish to think
that she would...

29:41.140 --> 29:43.740
No.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.780
You're not foolish.

29:49.650 --> 29:54.590
I know you have more important
things to think about.

29:54.590 --> 29:57.860
I just thought I'd give you
some potential good news.

30:00.490 --> 30:02.060
(pats leg)

30:03.060 --> 30:04.760
(pounds on table) How could you be
so stupid?

30:04.770 --> 30:07.800
Haitham, I'm telling you,
it's gonna be okay.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.400
He's not gonna give
us any trouble.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.770
We have an understanding.

30:10.770 --> 30:12.240
Maybe with you,
but not with me.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.170
Those were not very veiled
threats he made about my blog.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.170
And now this.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.740
I defended you.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.350
- You have to trust me...
- This is not America!

30:20.350 --> 30:23.350
People end up dead in ditches
because of shit like this.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.250
I'm aware of that.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.190
But you don't
know my father.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.260
Why couldn't you keep
your mouth shut?

30:31.260 --> 30:33.860
(quietly) Please don't be
angry with me. Please.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.270
Haitham, I'm telling you,
it's gonna be okay.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.500
I promise you.
It's not going to be okay.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.570
It's never
going to be okay again.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.670
I don't want to lose you.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.480
(chuckles softly)

30:51.480 --> 30:53.280
You barely even know me.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.680
You're just
a stupid kid, huh?

30:58.790 --> 31:02.220
And I'm a stupid,
stupid adult.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.430
Just leave, please.

31:09.630 --> 31:10.700
Leave!

31:32.890 --> 31:35.000
I want to know where
your husband is.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.720
I don't know where he is.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.060
That's what your
brother said, too.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.560
And I find that
hard to believe.

31:43.370 --> 31:47.570
You don't think it's strange
he just disappeared?

31:47.570 --> 31:49.270
I do.

31:49.270 --> 31:51.140
I assumed you had him.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.870
Don't look so shocked

31:54.870 --> 31:57.540
You're from Ma'an. People
disappear here all the time.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.550
Perhaps you should ask
the secret police.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.150
There is no secret police
anymore.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.410
Really?

32:08.620 --> 32:11.360
Are you going
to torture me?

32:11.360 --> 32:13.090
I don't like pain.

32:13.090 --> 32:15.690
I'm afraid of pain.

32:15.700 --> 32:19.030
I prefer to die quickly,
if I had a choice.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.630
I don't torture people.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.600
I was tortured.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.070
By the Caliphate.

32:26.070 --> 32:28.470
Your heroes.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.380
We're nothing like them.

32:30.380 --> 32:33.650
Then tell that
to my parents.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.550
Things have changed.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.750
Have they?

32:40.750 --> 32:43.220
We'll see.

32:43.220 --> 32:46.890
If you're not going
to torture me or kill me,

Eh.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.100
You still reject
the sheik's authority?

34:00.100 --> 34:02.030
Sheik Abdullah is not
from Abuddin, Ihab.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.470
So, in this vision of Abuddin
you think we share,

And when the time comes
for this election,

34:17.480 --> 34:20.489
you think Al Fayeed
will just step down?

34:20.489 --> 34:21.790
Bassam is not his brother.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.320
No.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.659
He's worse.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.389
He killed my wife.

Ihab, I swear to God,
unless you help me,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.000
Abuddin will burn.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.270
Is that really

34:35.270 --> 34:37.070
Are you asking me
to stop fighting?

I'm asking you to give me a
chance to win this election.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.580
(scoffs) Ramzi.

34:59.060 --> 35:02.260
There will be no election,

35:02.260 --> 35:04.930

No.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.640
I know who he is.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.550
Now do what I say.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.720
Um...

36:36.720 --> 36:38.960
at least tell me why.

Poison bait back

You will.

36:59.910 --> 37:01.980
Thank you.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.150
It's nice when families can have
activities they can do together.

37:07.150 --> 37:09.920

37:09.920 --> 37:12.220

We bury each other.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.560

of each other more.

Ahmed?

Look...

37:29.510 --> 37:32.280
There was so much history
between your father and me,

37:32.280 --> 37:34.180
but you and I never got

37:34.180 --> 37:36.750
the chance to spend much
time together, and I think

37:36.750 --> 37:38.750
in the future,

37:38.750 --> 37:40.990
we should do something
about that.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.390
My father will be
difficult to replace.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.860
But that would be nice.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.730
Would you do something
for me, Uncle?

37:52.730 --> 37:54.730
Let me help you.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.970
Give me a job, make me useful.

37:56.970 --> 38:00.040
Excuse me, Mr. President.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.710
Is this real?

38:05.710 --> 38:07.250
We analyzed the photo.
It's real.

It went up on a private site

A new face.

And when Al-Qadi comes home,
we'll be waiting.

I don't think he's coming back.
I think maybe he's gone over.

43:05.110 --> 43:07.780
Your...

43:11.250 --> 43:13.220
It's called phantom limb pain.

43:13.220 --> 43:15.550
What you're feeling.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.990
There is a way
to make it stop.

43:22.030 --> 43:25.760
I'm studying psychology
in school.

43:30.440 --> 43:34.310
You have to build something
called a mirror box.

43:34.310 --> 43:36.870
You put your good hand inside

43:36.880 --> 43:39.140
and you see a reflection.

43:39.150 --> 43:43.050
What your brain thinks
is your missing hand.

43:43.050 --> 43:46.520
You move your good hand around,
which tricks your brain

43:46.520 --> 43:49.320
(lower voice) into thinking...

43:53.090 --> 43:55.090
I'm sorry.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.100
I'll leave you alone.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.060
You don't think that I'm...

44:00.070 --> 44:01.730
I'm a monster?

44:02.770 --> 44:06.370
No.

44:11.010 --> 44:14.010
I want you to stay.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.730
Stay?

44:56.790 --> 45:01.790
♪♪

45:16.540 --> 45:19.740
I had no idea you could
quote Shakespeare.

45:22.410 --> 45:26.080
I went to school through
the third grade...

45:27.920 --> 45:30.890
but I taught
myself to read.

45:30.890 --> 45:33.990
I learned
everything I could.

45:33.990 --> 45:37.500
First, every book I could
find, and then online.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.900
You're like Abraham Lincoln.

45:39.900 --> 45:41.130
Who?

45:42.100 --> 45:44.000
I'm kidding.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.210
I'm proud of you.

45:52.210 --> 45:52.840
The people love you.

45:56.450 --> 45:57.550
I'm pretty sure they love you

45:57.550 --> 45:59.620
more than they love me
right now.

45:59.620 --> 46:01.790
You're like
a saint to them.

46:04.220 --> 46:08.530
I'm in this room sleeping
with a married man.

46:08.530 --> 46:11.300
I'm no kind of saint.

46:21.940 --> 46:23.810
I know Fauzi asked
you to marry him.

46:27.110 --> 46:28.450
He told you?

46:30.950 --> 46:32.320
What did you say?

46:33.790 --> 46:34.990
I didn't say anything.
I said...

46:34.990 --> 46:37.290
uh, I said I understood

46:37.290 --> 46:39.520
how he could fall in love
with you, which I can.

46:40.490 --> 46:41.730
Fauzi's a good man.

46:41.730 --> 46:44.230
He's a... He...
He has a lot to offer.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.830
What's that supposed to mean?

46:47.830 --> 46:50.570
Nothing, just...

46:50.570 --> 46:51.900
you're both people I love.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.440
What, are you saying
I should be with Fauzi?

46:53.440 --> 46:54.970
No, I'm not.

46:54.970 --> 46:57.010
I'm saying that I...

46:57.010 --> 46:59.340
I would understand
if that's what you wanted.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.250
Don't tell me what I want.

47:01.250 --> 47:04.150
I'm not, I'm just...

47:04.150 --> 47:06.080
I'm trying to be sensitive.

47:06.090 --> 47:08.000
I know there's only so much
that I can offer you.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.490
Bassam, I don't want
you to be sensitive!

47:10.490 --> 47:12.220
I want you to be
reckless. I want you

47:12.220 --> 47:14.260
to say, "I need you so much.

47:14.260 --> 47:17.430
I can't live a single day
without you."

47:17.430 --> 47:20.300
Otherwise, why are we doing
this terrible thing?

47:20.300 --> 47:23.070
- Okay, okay.
- I nearly died the other day.

47:23.070 --> 47:26.200
This whole damn world
is insane,

47:26.210 --> 47:29.710
and I'm just trying
to find something, anything,

47:29.710 --> 47:32.980
to help me through it,
even if it's not mine.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.450
So don't give me logic,

47:34.450 --> 47:35.950
and don't give me that
reasonable behavior

47:35.950 --> 47:38.280
because there is no
reasonable behavior anymore.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.780
Just tell me that you love me.

47:39.790 --> 47:42.290
Okay, okay, okay.

47:42.290 --> 47:43.750
I love you.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.120
I love you.

47:47.130 --> 47:49.360
Look at me.

47:52.530 --> 47:55.100
I love you.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.800
(breathing heavily)

48:10.180 --> 48:11.620
How did it go?

48:13.390 --> 48:16.090
You're hurt.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.100
Where is your brother?

48:26.100 --> 48:28.030
He's been arrested.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.530
They brought me in,
too, twice.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.600
They're looking for you.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.840
Did they hurt you?

48:32.840 --> 48:35.840
No, I'm okay.

48:41.610 --> 48:42.910
(whispering) Oh, my...

48:44.050 --> 48:45.620
Where are you going?

48:45.620 --> 48:46.620
To the mosque.

48:46.620 --> 48:48.990
To tell the truth.

48:53.230 --> 48:55.860
Welcome home.

49:10.380 --> 49:12.580
It does not mean
what you think it means.

49:12.580 --> 49:14.750
Really?

49:14.750 --> 49:16.080
You slip out of the country

49:16.080 --> 49:17.150
for a secret meeting

49:17.150 --> 49:18.750
with the leader
of a terrorist group.

49:18.750 --> 49:20.790
Tell me how I should
interpret that.

49:20.790 --> 49:22.250
I went to make peace.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.250
We were friends once.

49:23.260 --> 49:26.990
- I thought I could maybe...
- Do not waste my time!

49:26.990 --> 49:28.590
We checked phone records.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.430
Your brother-in-law
was in contact

49:31.430 --> 49:34.230
with Ihab to arrange the meeting
the very same day

49:34.230 --> 49:36.430
that he plotted the massacre
at the Commission.

49:36.440 --> 49:39.070
Oh, he called Ihab to help
you make peace, did he?

49:39.070 --> 49:40.770
No, no, Wafiq didn't know.

49:40.770 --> 49:43.310
I'm gonna have you arrested,
Sheik,

49:43.310 --> 49:45.810
and you're gonna be put on trial
for who you really are.

49:46.780 --> 49:48.850
On the basis
of this photograph?

49:48.850 --> 49:49.910
And what else?

49:49.910 --> 49:51.780
What evidence?

49:51.780 --> 49:52.950
Go ahead.

49:52.950 --> 49:54.090
Arrest me.

49:54.090 --> 49:56.190
Have your trial.
Make me a martyr.

49:56.190 --> 49:58.690
See how long it takes
for Abuddin to explode.

49:58.690 --> 50:01.630
You think you have me
either way, don't you?

50:01.630 --> 50:03.660
I'm damned if I do
and I'm damned if I don't.

50:03.660 --> 50:06.630
No, you're paranoid.

50:06.630 --> 50:08.200
I'm not your enemy.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.700
He killed my daughter
in front of my eyes,

50:11.700 --> 50:14.570
your friend,
the man you embraced.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.710
I know exactly
who my enemies are.

50:18.710 --> 50:21.810
I see all of you.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.520
And you will not come to power
through the front door

50:24.520 --> 50:28.720
of an election just to open
the back door to that man.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.730
The government
of President Bassam Al Fayeed

50:36.730 --> 50:38.800
has formally banned
Sheik Hussein Al-Qadi

50:38.800 --> 50:40.660
and his freedom party
from standing

50:40.670 --> 50:42.800
in the upcoming
presidential election.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.170
(man on TV) Thank you for that
report. The international...

50:44.170 --> 50:46.640
You did that without
talking to me.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.310
You're a candidate.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.540
It wouldn't have been
appropriate.

50:49.540 --> 50:50.780
What would you
have said, anyway?

50:50.780 --> 50:53.210
I would have said
let the people decide.

50:53.210 --> 50:54.880
You wanted democracy, right?

50:54.880 --> 50:56.510
The man is a traitor.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.720
Traitors don't get to run
for president.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.750
How do you know for a fact
that he's guilty?

51:02.760 --> 51:03.960
I spent time
with that man.

51:03.960 --> 51:04.860
Just a little, but still,

51:04.860 --> 51:05.860
this is not that man.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.090
So, you actually believe

51:07.090 --> 51:09.930
he walked into
Caliphate territory alone.

51:09.930 --> 51:12.160
Told Ihab bin Rashid
he should surrender,

51:12.170 --> 51:14.530
that he was coming back
to Abuddin to be his enemy,

51:14.530 --> 51:17.370
and those people let him live.

51:17.370 --> 51:19.200
I let bin Rashid slip away.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.170
I'm not making
the same mistake twice.

51:21.170 --> 51:23.140
He wouldn't have won, Bassam.

51:23.140 --> 51:23.910
That's not the point.

51:23.910 --> 51:25.310
Then what is the point?!

51:32.420 --> 51:35.390
You know
what your problem is?

51:35.390 --> 51:37.420
You're too filled
with hate now.

51:37.420 --> 51:40.560
You have your daughter
in your head.

51:40.560 --> 51:43.590
And that might make you
a very good father,

51:43.600 --> 51:46.600
but it makes you
a terrible President.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.170
(door closes)

52:04.220 --> 52:06.480
(Leila on TV) When we change

52:06.490 --> 52:09.320
who we are, even out of

52:09.320 --> 52:12.660
fear of a powerful enemy,

52:12.660 --> 52:16.790
we play directly
into that enemy's hands.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.260
So, today,

52:18.260 --> 52:21.100
out of protest...

52:21.100 --> 52:24.570
I'm resigning my post

52:24.570 --> 52:27.270
as Foreign Secretary.

52:27.270 --> 52:30.140
Our people
want a true democracy,

52:30.140 --> 52:31.940
and our people should...

52:31.940 --> 52:33.640
Have you seen this?

52:33.650 --> 52:35.850
I heard.

52:35.850 --> 52:39.180
I don't think it's going
to make much difference.

52:39.190 --> 52:41.250
I doubt Al-Qadi's
supporters

52:41.250 --> 52:43.890
will find her
an acceptable alternative.

52:47.430 --> 52:51.430
So, um, I was thinking maybe
you want to go for dinner.

53:00.670 --> 53:04.210
Two days ago, in this room,
I thought I was going to die.

53:05.980 --> 53:08.580
Everything is so fragile

53:08.580 --> 53:11.080
and uncertain.

53:12.050 --> 53:13.550
We can't afford to wait

53:13.550 --> 53:16.020
for what we want.

53:18.120 --> 53:20.260
Don't wait for me.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.800
These are fragile.

53:33.810 --> 53:35.070
Go on the top, please.

53:35.070 --> 53:38.010
Yes, madam.

53:38.010 --> 53:38.880
You didn't think

53:38.880 --> 53:39.740
I deserved to know

53:39.740 --> 53:41.910
before the rest of the world.

53:41.910 --> 53:44.350
Would it have mattered?

53:44.350 --> 53:46.920
It's nothing
but etiquette.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.550
Are you ready?

53:48.550 --> 53:50.320
I'm not leaving.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.320
What?

53:55.560 --> 53:56.860
Right.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.160
I've taken a commission
in the army,

53:59.170 --> 54:02.270
First Lieutenant
under General Maloof.

54:02.270 --> 54:05.470
I see, well...

54:11.440 --> 54:14.080
I'll be at my sister's
if you change your mind.

54:31.900 --> 54:36.470
Just so you know, I'm not going
to go easy on administration.

54:36.470 --> 54:38.740
You might come
under fire yourself.

54:38.740 --> 54:41.110
Well, that's fair warning.

54:41.110 --> 54:42.270
Anything else?

54:42.280 --> 54:45.080
Yes.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.710
I'm going to win this election.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.720
