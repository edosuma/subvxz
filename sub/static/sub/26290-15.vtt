Yellow metal means

03:02.627 --> 03:04.455
She's been at Keller Hogan

03:04.498 --> 03:05.848
She became CEO 13 months ago.

03:05.891 --> 03:08.154
She was the first-ever
female CEO

03:16.423 --> 03:17.903
Could be as simple as gender.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.645
Her appointment to CEO
created a lot of outrage.

03:20.689 --> 03:22.386
Critics felt that
the firm was trying

03:22.429 --> 03:23.822
to placate the MeToo movement,

03:23.866 --> 03:25.389
and Veronica didn't disappoint.

03:25.432 --> 03:27.130
She did her first
interview saying,

03:27.173 --> 03:29.175
"My primary goal

unspecific threats.

03:56.115 --> 03:57.595

"You don't perform,
you're fired."

04:03.645 --> 04:05.168

disenfranchised young loners.

08:42.010 --> 08:43.315
They're nothing like this guy.

08:43.359 --> 08:46.057
Heck, 92% earn at

According to my research,
damn near all victims are male,

08:48.755 --> 08:50.366

17:27.492 --> 17:34.065
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪♪</font></i>

17:34.108 --> 17:36.763
I pulled prints off
the duct tape for both bombs.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.940
The good news is, they belong
to the same person.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.247
The bad news is, that person
isn't in the system

17:42.290 --> 17:43.509
or named Nick Frost.

17:43.553 --> 17:45.598
Okay, what about Carly Fincher?

17:45.642 --> 17:48.514
You able to get into her phone,
email records, hard drive?

17:48.558 --> 17:50.864
Yeah, Kristen and her team
are analyzing the data now,

17:50.908 --> 17:52.953
trying to connect her
and Veronica.

17:52.997 --> 17:55.042
And I think we just found
that connection.

17:55.086 --> 17:57.392
Carly was a writer for
a blog called Street Beat.

17:57.436 --> 17:59.612
She wrote under a pseudonym,
Navi Poesky.

18:01.396 --> 18:03.268
Navi spelled backwards is Ivan.

18:03.311 --> 18:05.139
Could be a riff on Ivan Boesky.

18:05.183 --> 18:06.445
Who is he?

18:06.489 --> 18:08.621
He's one of the original
corporate raiders.

18:08.665 --> 18:11.276
He's the guy who said,
"Greed is good,"

18:11.319 --> 18:13.234
way before Michael Douglas
in "Wall Street."

18:13.278 --> 18:15.541
Okay, so Carly writes a
finance blog under a fake name.

18:15.585 --> 18:16.629
Mm-hmm.

18:16.673 --> 18:17.804
How does that make her a target

18:17.848 --> 18:19.066
or connected to Veronica?

18:19.110 --> 18:20.677
Carly wrote a series
of scathing articles

18:20.720 --> 18:22.287
about a guy named Stuart Moore.

18:22.330 --> 18:25.551
He was a rising star at...
You guessed it... Keller Hogan

18:25.595 --> 18:28.119
until Veronica fired him
for cause.

18:28.162 --> 18:31.601
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪♪</font></i>

18:31.644 --> 18:33.994
So Carly wrote four articles
about Stuart Moore.

18:34.038 --> 18:35.430
Basically eviscerating him
for being

18:35.474 --> 18:37.302
an out-of-touch boys' clubber.

18:37.345 --> 18:39.783
You know, oblivious to
the new, enlightened culture

18:39.826 --> 18:41.262
on Wall Street.

18:41.306 --> 18:43.656
What was the specific reason
for his termination?

18:43.700 --> 18:46.616
Spending company funds on an
extravagant, all-male weekend

18:46.659 --> 18:48.966
with a major client in Vegas.

18:49.009 --> 18:51.185
And then Rose Laporta,
the woman that works for Moore,

18:51.229 --> 18:53.361
found out about it,
felt excluded,

18:53.405 --> 18:54.885
and notified Human Resources.

18:58.062 --> 19:00.455
A Williams undergrad,
MBA from Columbia,

19:00.499 --> 19:02.022
divorced, one son.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.547
And unsurprisingly, his work
history ends at Keller Hogan.

19:04.590 --> 19:06.461
Gets fired,
press runs with the story,

19:06.505 --> 19:07.680
blows up his reputation.

19:07.724 --> 19:09.334
And so he decides
to blow up the people

19:09.377 --> 19:10.944
that blew him up
in the first place:

19:10.988 --> 19:13.207
Veronica Klein,
the CEO that fired his ass;

19:13.251 --> 19:14.818
And, uh, Carly Fincher,

19:14.861 --> 19:16.646
the blogger who couldn't
stop writing about him.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.996
Okay, dig into Moore and
anyone else who was involved

19:19.039 --> 19:20.301
in the termination proceeding.

19:20.345 --> 19:22.477
I want names of lawyers,
witnesses, executives,

19:22.521 --> 19:23.783
anybody who was a part of it.

19:23.827 --> 19:24.915
Copy that.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.264
Do we have an address
on this guy?

19:26.307 --> 19:27.961
Not yet. He seems
to have fallen off the map

19:28.005 --> 19:30.094
a few months ago.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.270
Okay.
Check in with Nick Frost.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.619
Find out if Moore
is even capable

19:33.663 --> 19:35.186
of doing something like this.

19:35.229 --> 19:36.579
Okay.

19:36.622 --> 19:40.844

19:40.887 --> 19:44.108
No, no,
Stewey is a great guy, okay?

19:44.151 --> 19:46.153
He's smart, loyal.

19:46.197 --> 19:47.546
He's real loyal, actually.

19:47.590 --> 19:49.417
Guy saved my ass more times
than I can count...

19:49.461 --> 19:50.897
Not for money either,

19:50.941 --> 19:52.769
just 'cause he's a...

19:52.812 --> 19:53.944
He's a good guy.

19:55.902 --> 19:57.643
When was the last time
you two spoke?

19:57.687 --> 19:59.297
Uh, about a year ago.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.995
After he got fired,
we kind of lost touch.

20:02.039 --> 20:03.083
Why is that?

20:03.127 --> 20:04.519
You know, he went from superstar

20:04.563 --> 20:05.912
to jackass overnight,

20:05.956 --> 20:08.132
all for playing golf
and going to a strip club

20:08.175 --> 20:10.134
with a $90-million-a-year
client.

20:10.177 --> 20:12.440
Hmm, well, times have changed.

20:12.484 --> 20:14.486
Yeah, well, a client
wants to ogle naked chicks,

20:14.529 --> 20:17.532
you take him to a place
with naked chicks, okay?

20:17.576 --> 20:19.752
They want to ogle penguins,
then you take them to the zoo.

20:19.796 --> 20:20.927
It's that simple.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.929
The point... the goal,
Special Agent,

20:22.973 --> 20:26.498
is to make money, okay,
not change the world.

20:28.282 --> 20:31.024
Okay, do you know
where Moore might be living?

20:31.068 --> 20:33.287
He fell off the grid
a few months ago.

20:33.331 --> 20:34.593
The only thing
I can think of is,

20:34.637 --> 20:36.682
his mother had a condo
in Chelsea.

20:36.726 --> 20:39.380
After she died,
she left it to him, so...

20:39.424 --> 20:41.339
But I'm telling you guys,
you're wasting your time.

20:41.382 --> 20:44.081
Old Stewey is no killer.

20:44.124 --> 20:46.257
Well, we're gonna go talk
to him all the same.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.432
Okay, I can go too, then?

20:47.475 --> 20:49.608
- Yeah.
- Uh, no.

20:49.652 --> 20:50.957
Actually, you can sit back down.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.655
You're gonna need an agent
to walk you to the door.

Hey, NYPD, can you BOLO his car and
get MTA and Port Authority up to speed?

21:37.115 --> 21:37.368
Sure.

21:37.369 --> 21:40.830
Hey, let's flag his credit and debit cards.
If Stuart Moore so much as buys a tissue,

21:40.831 --> 21:43.484
I want to know where he's standing
before he blows his nose.

21:43.527 --> 21:46.693
This HR report is a
pretty long and scathing

21:46.694 --> 21:48.382
indictment of Moore's
toxic behavior.

21:48.652 --> 21:52.047
But the so-called charges
are relatively benign.

21:52.090 --> 21:54.397
Depends on how
you define benign.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.790
He played golf and went to
strip clubs with male clients.

21:56.834 --> 21:59.228
No, he excluded
female associates

21:59.271 --> 22:01.621
from participating in
important professional events.

22:01.665 --> 22:04.015
That speaks to a pattern
of behavior,

22:04.059 --> 22:06.844
one that's malignant,
not benign.

22:06.887 --> 22:08.541
So as far as potential targets,

22:08.585 --> 22:09.934
we should start
with the witnesses

22:09.978 --> 22:12.023
that were involved
in the termination proceedings.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.068
There are 21 in all.

22:13.111 --> 22:14.547
And of those 21, 17 were women.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.593
We should focus on them first,
but we need new data.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.074
All this stuff is old.
We need fresh, real-time data.

22:19.117 --> 22:20.205
Maggie, it's Dana.

22:20.249 --> 22:21.250
You're still on the scene,
correct?

22:21.293 --> 22:22.729
Yes, we are.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.122
Okay, can you please tell us

22:24.166 --> 22:25.645
what all is in the apartment?

22:25.689 --> 22:27.821
And be very specific.

22:27.865 --> 22:30.476
<font color="#ffff00">(SIGHS)</font>

22:30.520 --> 22:33.218
Eight lead pipes,
about a foot long.

22:33.262 --> 22:35.916

22:35.960 --> 22:37.396

22:37.440 --> 22:40.008

22:40.051 --> 22:43.402
Probably ten pounds of sugar
and permanganate.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.838
He's not finished.

22:44.882 --> 22:46.753
There's still more pipe bombs
out there possibly.

22:46.797 --> 22:48.538
Looks that way.

22:49.321 --> 22:52.411
He's got a ton of cufflinks,
gold and silver.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.457
No monograms that I can see.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.764
So Moore is using cufflinks
as shrapnel

22:57.808 --> 22:59.070
as a metaphor.

22:59.114 --> 23:00.593
"I'm gonna kill the people
who stole my success

23:00.637 --> 23:03.074
with the very symbol
of that success."

23:03.118 --> 23:05.163
Yeah, it also sends a
pro-male/anti-feminist message.

23:05.207 --> 23:07.557
Cufflinks represent
masculinity and power.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.646
What else do you see, Maggie?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.474

23:11.517 --> 23:13.258
Uh...

23:13.302 --> 23:14.520
there's a lot of trash

23:14.564 --> 23:17.045
and takeout containers
on the counter.

23:17.088 --> 23:20.483
It looks like they haven't
been touched for weeks.

23:20.526 --> 23:23.225
So he's ignoring
his basic needs.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.141
So this new mission
has become all-consuming.

23:26.184 --> 23:28.186
And in the living room...

23:28.230 --> 23:29.883
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪♪</font></i>

23:29.927 --> 23:31.798
About a dozen awards and plaques

23:31.842 --> 23:33.148
that are shattered
on the ground.

23:33.191 --> 23:35.019
Right,
because when he was on top,

23:35.063 --> 23:37.108
he proudly displayed
all those accolades.

23:37.152 --> 23:38.501
Now that he's on the bottom,

23:38.544 --> 23:40.329
it's a cruel reminder
of the past,

23:40.372 --> 23:42.070
so he destroys them

23:42.113 --> 23:44.637
and then he vows to destroy
those who diminished him.

23:44.681 --> 23:45.856
The question is,

23:45.899 --> 23:48.250
who is at the top
of that very long list?

23:48.293 --> 23:49.642
Keller Hogan,
Street Beat employees...

23:49.686 --> 23:51.035
They're all still on the table.

23:51.079 --> 23:52.558
Again, I say we start
with the women

23:52.602 --> 23:54.082
and we focus on the ones
who profited the most

23:54.125 --> 23:55.561
from his demise.

23:55.605 --> 23:58.782
Frost keeps emphasizing
how loyal Moore was.

23:58.825 --> 24:01.306
So maybe it's not about
the money at all or gender.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.395
Maybe it's really
about fidelity.

24:03.439 --> 24:05.484
The destruction of all those
Wall Street accolades

24:05.528 --> 24:08.618
really is about a betrayal.

a lot of it.

in Stuart Moore's apartment

or attacked him.

bomb-making materials

25:45.998 --> 25:47.477

to his apartment.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.635
Mm-hmm, so let's calculate...

35:18.679 --> 35:20.115
How fast he walks
and how far he could travel

35:20.159 --> 35:22.291
in 3 1/2 minutes?
Yeah.

35:22.335 --> 35:25.207
The postmaster general froze
all deliveries in Manhattan.

35:25.251 --> 35:26.992
All the major private services
are on board too.

35:27.035 --> 35:28.689
Good, but it looks like Cameron

35:28.732 --> 35:31.257
made his own personal delivery
somewhere north of 18th Street.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.693
Okay, I did the math.

35:32.736 --> 35:35.000
The radius is between
18th and 23rd Street,

35:35.043 --> 35:36.958
somewhere between
6th and 9th Avenues.

35:37.002 --> 35:40.309
Okay, so the only
two persons of interest

35:40.353 --> 35:41.397
who live and work nearby

35:41.441 --> 35:43.138
are Rose Laporta,
the whistleblower,

35:43.182 --> 35:44.444
and our good buddy Nick Frost.

35:44.487 --> 35:45.967
Neither one is answering calls.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.535
Traffic is gridlocked
heading north and west.

35:48.578 --> 35:50.276
Sirens or no sirens, it's
gonna be tough to get there.

35:50.319 --> 35:51.799
Get Maggie and OA there.

35:51.843 --> 35:53.322
They're on their way to
Cameron's mother's apartment.

35:53.366 --> 35:54.889
They're not gonna be able
to hit both targets in time.

35:54.933 --> 35:56.673
Then let's focus on Rose.

35:56.717 --> 35:58.893
The bomber clearly has
an anti-feminist agenda.

35:58.937 --> 36:01.200
No, no, this is about loyalty.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.854
The odds of a third victim
breaking pattern

36:02.897 --> 36:04.377
are extremely low.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.161
I don't give a damn about odds.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.771
What I've seen and what
I've heard tell me

36:07.815 --> 36:10.209
that Cameron is gunning
for Nick Frost.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.167
Frost said, and I quote,

36:12.211 --> 36:14.866
Moore saved his ass
more times than he can count,

36:14.909 --> 36:16.302
but Frost didn't return
the favor.

36:16.345 --> 36:17.520
Instead he turned on him.

36:17.564 --> 36:19.740
In Cameron's mind
and in his father's mind,

36:19.783 --> 36:21.350
that is the act
of ultimate betrayal.

36:21.394 --> 36:23.135
Listen, with all due respect,

36:23.178 --> 36:25.093
I was sent here by the
assistant director in charge

36:25.137 --> 36:26.703
to profile this case,
and that's what I'm doing.

36:26.747 --> 36:27.835
We go with Rose.

36:27.879 --> 36:31.230
Do you understand?
Okay.

36:31.273 --> 36:34.668
This is my office, Spencer.

36:34.711 --> 36:35.799
I make the tactical calls,

36:35.843 --> 36:37.279
and if the ADIC
has a problem with that,

36:37.323 --> 36:39.542
he can call me directly.

He's not here.

No sign of suspicious packages

37:21.584 --> 37:23.499

37:23.543 --> 37:25.110
Okay, we have visual proof
that Cameron

37:25.153 --> 37:26.981
dumped that backpack
somewhere in that vicinity.

37:27.025 --> 37:28.287
Did you clear his office?

37:28.330 --> 37:30.028
Uh, yeah, security
checked the mail logs too.

37:30.071 --> 37:31.377
No packages
have been delivered to him

37:31.420 --> 37:33.640
in the last several hours.

37:33.683 --> 37:35.903

deliver that bomb?

Provence, Bruno's,

is the Brentham Club.

in his apartment.
