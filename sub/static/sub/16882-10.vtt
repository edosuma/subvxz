00:06.840 --> 00:08.842
(grunts)

00:14.082 --> 00:16.050
(typing)

00:18.786 --> 00:20.554
* I can't fall

00:20.588 --> 00:22.323
For this again

00:22.356 --> 00:25.859
I will try till the very end

00:25.893 --> 00:27.428
* Holy days

00:27.461 --> 00:29.063
Holy nights

00:29.097 --> 00:30.431
You shook me once

00:30.464 --> 00:32.733
* But you won't do it twice

00:32.766 --> 00:34.335
I should have known

00:34.368 --> 00:35.869
You wouldn't stick

00:35.903 --> 00:37.271
* 'Cause you're a habit

00:37.305 --> 00:39.607
That I just can't kick

00:39.640 --> 00:41.375
So when you're done

00:41.409 --> 00:43.077
* Letting me down

00:43.111 --> 00:46.780
I won't be around, no

00:46.814 --> 00:48.116
I'm moving on

00:48.149 --> 00:49.950
* I'm moving on

00:49.983 --> 00:52.019
I'm moving on

00:52.052 --> 00:53.721
I'm moving on

00:53.754 --> 00:55.389
* I'm moving on, baby

00:55.423 --> 00:57.258
I'm moving on

00:57.291 --> 00:59.059
I got to keep moving

00:59.093 --> 01:01.595
On, on, on... *

01:01.629 --> 01:03.397
(stomach rumbling)

01:03.431 --> 01:05.699
(panting)

01:05.733 --> 01:07.668
(stomach rumbling loudly)

01:13.107 --> 01:14.808
(stomach continues rumbling)

01:14.842 --> 01:16.244
* I see you walking

01:16.277 --> 01:18.146
Down the street

01:18.179 --> 01:19.447
You're picking pockets

01:19.480 --> 01:21.582
* Of the ones you meet

01:21.615 --> 01:23.151
You always say

01:23.184 --> 01:24.485
You never told... *

01:24.518 --> 01:26.954
(truck creaking rhythmically)

01:26.987 --> 01:28.956
(panting)

01:33.294 --> 01:35.629
* I don't think we should

01:35.663 --> 01:37.265
So when your weight

01:37.298 --> 01:39.267
Is bringing you down

01:39.300 --> 01:42.903
* I won't be around, no

01:42.936 --> 01:44.472
I'm moving on

01:44.505 --> 01:46.340
I'm moving on

01:46.374 --> 01:48.108
* I'm moving on

01:48.142 --> 01:49.777
I'm moving on

01:49.810 --> 01:51.345
I'm moving on, baby

01:51.379 --> 01:52.513
I'm moving on... *

01:52.546 --> 01:53.747
(phone chimes)

01:53.781 --> 01:55.483
* Got to keep moving

01:55.516 --> 01:59.119
On, on, on. *

02:16.870 --> 02:20.140
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:20.174 --> 02:22.176
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:22.210 --> 02:24.812
Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:32.353 --> 02:35.022
*

02:35.055 --> 02:37.791
* Lost and you won't let it up

02:37.825 --> 02:39.893
Feeling tired... *

02:39.927 --> 02:41.795
*

02:41.829 --> 02:44.965
>> BECCA: Excuse me.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.166
What the hell is Jimmy doing

02:46.200 --> 02:47.167
here?

02:47.201 --> 02:48.336
And I thought you promised you

02:48.369 --> 02:49.169
weren't gonna make your

02:49.203 --> 02:50.170
disgusting punch.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.071
>> VERNON: Babe, my boys expect

02:51.104 --> 02:52.005
the trash juice.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.006
>> BECCA: Your boys?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.007
>> VERNON: Yeah. You know I

02:54.041 --> 02:55.008
never get to see them.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.009
Dave's got, like, a billion

02:56.043 --> 02:57.010
stupid kids, and Slider's a

02:57.044 --> 02:58.212
state senator now. It sucks.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.213
>> BECCA: Fine, but why did you

02:59.247 --> 03:00.414
invite Jimmy?

03:00.448 --> 03:01.415
>> VERNON: Men stop making

03:01.449 --> 03:02.416
friends at 23. It's science.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.417
When was the last time I had any

03:03.451 --> 03:04.418
visitors to my man cave, except

03:04.452 --> 03:05.586
that zero Paul?

03:05.619 --> 03:06.820
>> LINDSAY: Hey!

03:06.854 --> 03:07.821
>> BECCA: Did you bring the

03:07.855 --> 03:09.022
lemons?

03:09.056 --> 03:10.224
>> LINDSAY: Ah...

03:10.258 --> 03:11.425
>> BECCA: I give people one job!

03:11.459 --> 03:12.593
>> VERNON: Hey, Linds, taste

03:12.626 --> 03:13.327
this.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.328
>> BECCA: No, thanks.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.829
I'm actually not drinking.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.664
Psst.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.398
>> BECCA: What?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.832
>> LINDSAY: Listen, I never told

03:18.866 --> 03:20.234
Paul about what I told you at

03:20.268 --> 03:21.034
yoga.

03:21.068 --> 03:21.869
>> BECCA: You promised!

03:21.902 --> 03:22.770
>> LINDSAY: I'm snowballing

03:22.803 --> 03:23.604
here, sis.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.872
It's like that time you guys had

03:24.905 --> 03:26.340
that intervention for me right

03:26.374 --> 03:27.341
after semester at sea.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.409
>> BECCA: You know what, Linds?

03:28.442 --> 03:29.410
Your cockaholism may be just

03:29.443 --> 03:30.411
about the least important thing

03:30.444 --> 03:31.612
in the world to me right now.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.880
I need this party to go off

03:32.913 --> 03:34.782
without a hitch.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.585
It's a big deal.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.053
>> VERNON: You sure?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.189
>> LINDSAY: Maybe just a sip.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.524
>> VERNON: Just have a sip.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.559
Here you go.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.560
>> BECCA: Well...

03:46.594 --> 03:47.628
I didn't know you'd be coming.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.896
>> JIMMY: Can we do this later?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.063
I have to find Gretchen.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.231
>> BECCA: Oh, did that idiot

03:51.265 --> 03:52.433
invite her, too?

03:52.466 --> 03:53.634
I'm actually glad you're here.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.902
>> JIMMY: Why? You're gonna try

03:54.935 --> 03:56.069
and have sex with me again?

03:56.103 --> 03:57.237
>> BECCA: It was a momentary

03:57.271 --> 03:58.572
lapse of sanity.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.240
So, thank you for... going

04:00.274 --> 04:01.809
against your animal instincts

04:01.842 --> 04:03.076
towards me.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.244
>> JIMMY: My animal instinct is

04:04.278 --> 04:05.413
to run into traffic.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.614
>> BECCA: Oh, come on, Jimmy.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.815
We both know I could have

04:07.848 --> 04:09.082
flicked off one shoe...

04:09.116 --> 04:10.250
>> JIMMY: Your feet are awful,

04:10.284 --> 04:11.419
Bec.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.654
Shallow nail beds, pathetic

04:13.687 --> 04:14.922
arches.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.089
I only forced myself to

04:16.123 --> 04:17.257
occasionally finish on the

04:17.291 --> 04:18.292
abominable things so you

04:18.326 --> 04:19.493
wouldn't know how repulsive they

04:19.527 --> 04:21.462
really are.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.796
>> BECCA: Well, at least my

04:22.830 --> 04:25.098
heart isn't repulsive, Jimmy!

04:43.851 --> 04:44.818
>> LINDSAY: Hey, you.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.819
>> JIMMY: Hey.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.820
Have-have you seen Gretchen?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.021
>> LINDSAY: Remember when you

04:48.055 --> 04:49.289
started dating my sister,

04:49.323 --> 04:50.991
she and I were still living

04:51.024 --> 04:52.192
together, and I would listen

04:52.225 --> 04:53.994
through the wall and scrunch my

04:54.027 --> 04:55.195
pillow into the perfect shape?

04:55.228 --> 04:56.364
>> JIMMY: No! Stop. What?!

04:56.397 --> 04:57.631
>> LINDSAY: I've had that pillow

04:57.665 --> 04:58.799
since I was 11.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.868
His name is Brandon

05:00.901 --> 05:03.837
Pointycorners.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
>> JIMMY: Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa!

05:05.873 --> 05:07.040
Have you lost your mind?!

05:07.074 --> 05:08.308
>> LINDSAY: Come on.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.477
Just kiss me.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.678
You and Gretchen broke up.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.480
It doesn't matter.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.647
We're all gonna die.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.316
(Jimmy gasps)

05:16.350 --> 05:18.519
Oh, no.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.720
Oh, no!

05:19.753 --> 05:22.155
Gretchen!

05:23.891 --> 05:25.292
>> TOMMY: Dude.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.326
>> EDGAR: Oh, hey, Jimmy.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.328
This is my new roommate Nigel.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.530
Nigel, this is my old roommate.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.731
>> JIMMY: Hi.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.732
Do we know each other?

05:31.765 --> 05:32.733
>> TOMMY (British accent):

05:32.766 --> 05:33.634
I don't think so.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.168
How is it, then, mate?

05:35.202 --> 05:36.336
>> JIMMY: You just happened to

05:36.370 --> 05:37.538
find another English roommate?

05:37.571 --> 05:38.739
>> EDGAR: Yup.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.007
>> JIMMY: When did you come

05:40.040 --> 05:41.174
over?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.342
>> TOMMY: Uh, May 2008.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.544
I was at university there

05:43.577 --> 05:44.745
studying design, but it wasn't

05:44.778 --> 05:46.013
for me.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.180
>> JIMMY: Dorm or apartment?

05:47.214 --> 05:48.348
>> TOMMY: Oh, you mean flat.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.550
Dorm.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.819
Uh, Scotia Quay.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.822
Why? Do you know it?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.425
>> LINDSAY: Gretchen!

05:57.458 --> 06:00.260
Gretchen.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.597
Ooh. Gretchen!

06:03.631 --> 06:06.066
Don't you walk away from me!

06:06.099 --> 06:07.768
>> GRETCHEN: You were trying to

06:07.801 --> 06:10.003
kiss my boy... my ex-boyfriend!

06:10.037 --> 06:11.204
What is wrong with you?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.706
>> LINDSAY: I have a disease.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.574
>> GRETCHEN: Your only disease

06:13.607 --> 06:14.575
is that you don't love your

06:14.608 --> 06:15.242
husband.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.243
>> LINDSAY: I'm trying to be

06:16.276 --> 06:16.910
better.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.011
>> GRETCHEN: By kissing Jimmy?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.012
You creep!

06:19.046 --> 06:19.880
>> * Hello, my honey

06:19.913 --> 06:20.881
Hello, my ragtime gal... *

06:20.914 --> 06:21.915
>> LINDSAY: I lost my best

06:21.949 --> 06:22.883
friend.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.885
I'm losing my husband.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.053
I don't know what I want.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.254
(shouting): Shut up, you fish!

06:27.287 --> 06:28.622
>> * And you'll be left be alone

06:28.656 --> 06:29.623
(skipping): Be left alone

06:29.657 --> 06:30.891
Be left alone

06:30.924 --> 06:32.726
Be... left... alone... *

06:32.760 --> 06:34.027
(music stops)

06:34.061 --> 06:35.696
>> LINDSAY: You left me behind,

06:35.729 --> 06:38.231
Gretchen, at the rapper party,

06:38.265 --> 06:39.399
in life.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.568
You always leave me behind.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.735
>> GRETCHEN: I had to figure out

06:41.769 --> 06:42.936
my own shit!

06:42.970 --> 06:44.137
And I can't do that with you

06:44.171 --> 06:46.740
sitting on my shoulder like some

06:46.774 --> 06:49.042
stacked cartoon devil

06:49.076 --> 06:51.445
whispering, "Take dicks, do more

06:51.479 --> 06:52.713
coke, help me destroy my

06:52.746 --> 06:53.481
marriage."

06:53.514 --> 06:54.615
>> LINDSAY: That is really

06:54.648 --> 06:55.649
hurtful.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.417
You think I'm the devil?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.586
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy was gonna

06:58.619 --> 06:59.286
propose to me.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.120
>> LINDSAY: What?!

07:00.153 --> 07:01.254
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.289
I found the ring.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.557
That's why I stopped seeing him.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.758
It's why I've been acting so

07:04.792 --> 07:05.459
weird.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.794
>> LINDSAY: Oh, my God.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.261
I can't believe it.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.663
What is wrong with him?

07:09.697 --> 07:11.164
>> GRETCHEN: I know!

07:11.198 --> 07:13.100
Hey.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.936
>> LINDSAY: Well, at least you

07:15.969 --> 07:17.270
tried with Jimmy.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.238
>> GRETCHEN: Did I really,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.339
though?

07:19.372 --> 07:20.641
Part of me feels like I had one

07:20.674 --> 07:21.609
foot out the door the whole

07:21.642 --> 07:22.275
time.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.243
But, I mean, marriage?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.012
How ridiculous is that?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.446
It's so ordinary.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.414
>> LINDSAY: I know.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.982
What's wrong with us?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.318
Are we feminists?

07:31.351 --> 07:33.120
Is this feminism?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.354
>> GRETCHEN: We're just running

07:34.387 --> 07:35.322
away from stuff.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.490
I don't think that's feminism.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.958
It's fear.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.292
>> LINDSAY: So what are you

07:39.326 --> 07:40.528
saying?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.462
That actually trying is the

07:42.496 --> 07:44.464
brave thing?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.836
>> GRETCHEN: Maybe.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.505
Maybe buying in is really the

07:51.539 --> 07:55.308
punk rock choice.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.044
Am I considering this?

07:57.077 --> 07:57.978
Oh, my God.

07:58.011 --> 07:58.979
>> LINDSAY: Uh-uh, bitch.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.380
Don't you leave me behind!

08:00.413 --> 08:01.515
You're not gonna be the only one

08:01.549 --> 08:03.717
trying things.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.352
I know.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.486
I'll have a baby!

08:06.520 --> 08:07.655
>> GRETCHEN: Ew! With Paul?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.156
>> LINDSAY: Yes!

08:09.189 --> 08:13.126
Gretch, we're going to buy in.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.494
>> GRETCHEN: I think we may be

08:14.528 --> 08:15.328
growing up.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.329
>> LINDSAY: I know.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.330
Isn't it awful?

08:17.364 --> 08:18.331
>> GRETCHEN: If you ever try to

08:18.365 --> 08:19.332
kiss Jimmy again, I will punch

08:19.366 --> 08:20.167
you in the clit.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.902
>> LINDSAY: Deal.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.840
>> JIMMY: The Scotland

08:26.874 --> 08:27.675
situation, huh?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.676
>> TOMMY: Ugh. "Stay with us,

08:28.709 --> 08:29.543
Scotland.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.544
You belong in the UK."

08:30.578 --> 08:31.278
>> EDGAR: Mm-hmm.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.212
>> JIMMY: Coronation Street

08:32.245 --> 08:33.146
finally cancelled.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.214
>> TOMMY: Jimmy, if it had been,

08:34.247 --> 08:35.315
my mum would have rung me

08:35.348 --> 08:36.550
crying, so I think that you're

08:36.584 --> 08:37.751
wrong about that one.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.219
(laughter)

08:39.252 --> 08:41.589
>> JIMMY: All right.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.758
So where are you guys living?

08:44.792 --> 08:45.759
>> EDGAR: Uh, we're over, uh...

08:45.793 --> 08:46.760
>> TOMMY: Uh, west, uh... No.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.761
>> EDGAR: N-Nicaragua.

08:47.795 --> 08:48.762
>> TOMMY: Little. Little.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.763
Little. Little...

08:49.797 --> 08:50.864
>> EDGAR: L-Little...

08:50.898 --> 08:52.566
>> BOTH: Little Nicaragua.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.567
>> JIMMY: I knew it!

08:53.601 --> 08:55.268
You rubbish liars.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.503
>> TOMMY (no accent): Sorry,

08:56.536 --> 08:57.504
Edgar.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.872
I studied as hard as I could.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.040
>> JIMMY: Talk.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.041
>> EDGAR: He's an actor I met a

09:01.074 --> 09:03.376
while back.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.578
>> JIMMY: NCIS: L.A.?

09:04.612 --> 09:05.579
>> TOMMY: Yes!

09:05.613 --> 09:07.080
(laughs) Thank you!

09:07.114 --> 09:09.382
Thanks. I love my fans.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.418
Well, uh, I'm gonna go mingle.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.452
>> EDGAR: I'll-I'll come with

09:12.485 --> 09:13.453
you.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.722
>> TOMMY: Keep watching, dude.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.256
>> JIMMY: Oh, of course.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.692
(chuckles)

09:18.726 --> 09:19.693
>> BECCA: Hey, hey.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.293
Hey, hey, hey.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.294
No, no one can leave yet.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.396
No, actually, guys, you...

09:23.430 --> 09:24.531
>> VERNON: You want a juice?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.298
Do you want a trash juice?

09:25.332 --> 09:25.966
Trash juice.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.800
Are you ready for your trash

09:26.834 --> 09:27.534
juice?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.568
Here's the rest of the vodka.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.302
I'm putting it in.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.303
Trash juice! Trash juice!

09:30.337 --> 09:31.304
Trash juice.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.740
I made so much trash juice.

09:32.773 --> 09:33.774
You guys should have some.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.809
Do I have to drink all this

09:35.843 --> 09:38.946
trash juice by myself?!

09:38.979 --> 09:41.114
Ah!

09:41.148 --> 09:42.750
Drink your juice, boys!

09:42.783 --> 09:45.886
*

09:45.919 --> 09:47.888
>> * Brooklyn, Brooklyn

09:47.921 --> 09:49.289
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, hey *

09:49.322 --> 09:50.290
>> * C'est si bon

09:50.323 --> 09:51.458
She love to get it on

09:51.491 --> 09:52.760
Every time I see her

09:52.793 --> 09:54.394
* I cut like coupons

09:54.427 --> 09:56.730
Yeah, Kovas is the beast

09:56.764 --> 09:57.798
Do the rap in the track

09:57.831 --> 09:59.099
Triple-double, no assists... *

09:59.132 --> 10:01.835
>> LINDSAY: There you are.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.638
Doing dishes at someone else's

10:04.672 --> 10:06.139
house.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.308
I saw this and thought of you,

10:08.341 --> 10:10.343
because you're so sweet.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.680
And because you love raisins.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.747
Even though they're disgusting

10:13.781 --> 10:15.816
failed grapes.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.987
Sorry what I said about raisins.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.254
>> PAUL: I saw you trying to

10:21.288 --> 10:23.623
kiss Jimmy.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.958
>> LINDSAY: What? What?!

10:24.992 --> 10:25.959
What are... what are you...

10:25.993 --> 10:26.960
>> PAUL: I'm not stupid.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.361
I saw you.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.297
>> LINDSAY: Come on.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.265
You're my Paullywog.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.767
>> PAUL: Stop it.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.968
You respect me so little that

10:35.002 --> 10:35.969
you...

10:36.003 --> 10:36.970
>> LINDSAY: Honey.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.139
Okay, honey, I know.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.208
I'm sorry, but that was before.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.209
>> PAUL: That was half an hour

10:42.242 --> 10:43.210
ago.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.145
>> LINDSAY: Right, before now.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.781
I...

10:47.815 --> 10:50.784
(Paul sighs)

10:50.818 --> 10:52.853
I'm so messed up.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.154
>> PAUL: You don't need a

10:54.187 --> 10:56.556
telescope to see that.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.569
(quiet chatter)

11:14.374 --> 11:15.542
>> JIMMY: There you are.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.577
Hey. Right, listen...

11:17.610 --> 11:18.812
>> GRETCHEN: You listen.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.813
I know that I have issues, but

11:19.847 --> 11:21.214
it is not up to you to fix them.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.215
>> JIMMY: You're right.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.216
Okay, look, I massively

11:23.250 --> 11:24.551
overstepped with your parents,

11:24.584 --> 11:26.386
and nothing like that will ever

11:26.419 --> 11:27.554
happen again.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.555
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.556
>> JIMMY: Okay?

11:29.589 --> 11:30.557
>> GRETCHEN: I did not expect

11:30.590 --> 11:32.492
you to apologize so quickly.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.495
Look, I appreciate that we have

11:35.528 --> 11:38.665
a strong connection, but right

11:38.698 --> 11:40.533
now, that?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.269
That's crazytown. (chuckles)

11:42.302 --> 11:44.171
Have I thought about it?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.007
Maybe in some abstract way way

11:47.040 --> 11:49.709
down the line, but clearly now

11:49.743 --> 11:53.346
would be bonkers.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.582
But...

11:55.615 --> 11:57.350
then I started thinking about

11:57.384 --> 12:01.054
it, and maybe we're like two pit

12:01.088 --> 12:02.255
bulls, you know?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.124
You put either with another dog,

12:04.157 --> 12:05.725
and that dog's toast.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.627
But, together, they're couch

12:07.660 --> 12:08.728
buds.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.297
They nullify the threat through

12:10.330 --> 12:13.366
mutually assured destruction.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.103
So, uh... I don't know.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.138
I mean, it's bananas, Jimmy.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.241
But, um...

12:21.274 --> 12:24.644
What I mean is, uh...

12:24.677 --> 12:26.814
Whew!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.648
I mean, the punk rock choice,

12:28.681 --> 12:30.784
Jimmy, is yes.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.320
So screw it. Why not?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.555
Yes, Jimmy.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.524
Yes.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.560
>> JIMMY: What are you talking

12:40.593 --> 12:41.561
about?

12:41.594 --> 12:42.629
>> GRETCHEN: I found the

12:42.662 --> 12:44.231
engagement ring in your drawer.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.966
That is why I freaked out.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.134
>> JIMMY: Oh...

12:47.167 --> 12:48.568
>> GRETCHEN: But then I started

12:48.601 --> 12:50.337
thinking about it, and-and the

12:50.370 --> 12:53.273
thing about pit bulls, how...

12:53.306 --> 12:56.309
Oh, God.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.677
>> JIMMY: Th-The ring was for

12:57.710 --> 12:58.745
Becca.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.679
Almost three years ago.

12:59.712 --> 13:00.680
I was... I was just too

13:00.713 --> 13:02.315
embarrassed to return it.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.750
D-Did you...

13:03.783 --> 13:04.751
Oh, Gretchen, don't be

13:04.784 --> 13:05.752
embarrassed.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.820
>> GRETCHEN: I shit myself

13:06.854 --> 13:07.855
earlier, and that is only the

13:07.888 --> 13:09.322
second most embarrassing thing

13:09.356 --> 13:11.258
that has happened to me today.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.226
>> JIMMY: Oh...

13:15.395 --> 13:16.363
>> LINDSAY: (gasps) Are you

13:16.396 --> 13:17.064
leaving?

13:17.097 --> 13:17.931
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, I cannot stay

13:17.965 --> 13:18.832
here anymore.

13:18.866 --> 13:19.799
>> LINDSAY: You can't leave me

13:19.833 --> 13:20.934
again.

13:20.968 --> 13:21.935
I'm seriously gonna lose it.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.603
Gretchen, you have to stay.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.272
Or... I'm gonna suck that guy's

13:25.305 --> 13:26.639
dick.

13:26.673 --> 13:27.841
And that guy's dick.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.376
And definitely that guy's dick.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.643
>> GRETCHEN: Okay, okay.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.613
I'll stay. I'll stay.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.582
Why do you smell like shrimp?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.387
>> BECCA: Hello.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.655
Hello. (chuckles)

13:42.689 --> 13:45.725
Hello? Quiet.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.494
Shut that goddamn music off.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.495
(music stops)

13:48.528 --> 13:51.831
Okay, well, whew, first of all,

13:51.865 --> 13:55.002
how hashtag blessed are we to

13:55.035 --> 13:57.137
have you, our dearest friends,

13:57.170 --> 13:58.505
gathered with us tonight?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.040
As a society, we go through

14:00.073 --> 14:01.875
nothing alone.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.211
We are a family.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.579
A family of friends, coworkers,

14:06.613 --> 14:07.747
neighbors we don't know very

14:07.780 --> 14:08.748
well...

14:08.781 --> 14:09.749
>> JIMMY: Listen, I had a

14:09.782 --> 14:10.750
momentary lapse of sanity with

14:10.783 --> 14:11.751
Becca.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.752
>> GRETCHEN: The worst thing is

14:12.785 --> 14:13.753
this means you wanted to marry

14:13.786 --> 14:14.988
Becca, but you can't even let me

14:15.022 --> 14:15.989
spend the night without it

14:16.023 --> 14:17.057
becoming a goddamn traumatic

14:17.090 --> 14:18.058
event.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.060
>> BECCA: Shh!

14:22.795 --> 14:25.165
29 years ago, a baby girl was

14:25.198 --> 14:26.399
born.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.600
>> VERNON: 29?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.002
>> BECCA: And all she wanted,

14:29.036 --> 14:30.170
ever since she was pretending to

14:30.203 --> 14:32.705
breast-feed her Baby All Gone,

14:32.739 --> 14:35.075
was to have her own baby.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.676
There is a quote from one of my

14:36.709 --> 14:38.411
favorite books, The Little

14:38.445 --> 14:39.779
Prince by Antoine de...

14:39.812 --> 14:40.780
>> VERNON: I pregged her up, you

14:40.813 --> 14:41.781
guys!

14:41.814 --> 14:42.782
>> BECCA: I'm pregnant!

14:42.815 --> 14:44.584
I'm having a baby!

14:44.617 --> 14:47.587
(crowd cheering)

14:47.620 --> 14:48.721
(laughs)

14:48.755 --> 14:49.722
Thank you.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.959
>> LINDSAY: Hello, everybody!

14:51.992 --> 14:53.961
(laughs)

14:53.994 --> 14:57.064
Um, we're having a baby, too!

14:57.097 --> 14:58.065
(scattered applause)

14:58.098 --> 15:00.800
Well, not yet, but we're gonna

15:00.833 --> 15:02.569
start trying to have one.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.570
Yay!

15:03.603 --> 15:04.571
>> BECCA: What is wrong with

15:04.604 --> 15:05.572
you?

15:05.605 --> 15:06.573
How dare you try to ruin my

15:06.606 --> 15:07.574
moment.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.575
>> LINDSAY: It's always your

15:08.608 --> 15:09.576
moment!

15:09.609 --> 15:10.810
When's my moment?

15:10.843 --> 15:11.979
>> BECCA: You had your moment

15:12.012 --> 15:13.080
when you got married before your

15:13.113 --> 15:14.447
older sister, which is an

15:14.481 --> 15:15.983
aggressive and hateful act in

15:16.016 --> 15:16.984
any culture!

15:17.017 --> 15:17.985
>> LINDSAY: This isn't about

15:18.018 --> 15:18.986
you.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.587
This is about me and Paul

15:20.620 --> 15:21.588
and-and our...

15:21.621 --> 15:25.092
>> PAUL: Stop it!

15:25.125 --> 15:26.759
I'm not having a baby with you.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.760
>> LINDSAY: Paul?

15:27.794 --> 15:28.761
>> PAUL: Because I'm having a

15:28.795 --> 15:30.163
baby with someone else.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.599
(crowd gasping)

15:32.632 --> 15:34.667
At some point.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.303
In the future.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.670
Because I'm involved with

15:37.704 --> 15:38.671
someone else.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.672
(crowd gasping)

15:39.706 --> 15:41.408
Though, to be fair, it's purely

15:41.441 --> 15:42.842
emotional at this point.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.412
I'm having an emotional affair.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.779
>> LINDSAY: What are you talking

15:46.813 --> 15:47.814
about?

15:47.847 --> 15:49.482
>> PAUL: Her name is Amy.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.784
We met on a homebrew chat room.

15:51.818 --> 15:52.852
>> VERNON: (laughs) What a

15:52.885 --> 15:54.854
loser.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.623
>> PAUL: Amy...

15:56.656 --> 15:58.325
She's excited about me.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.327
She's... nice to me.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.694
>> LINDSAY: Bear.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.962
>> PAUL: Lindsay, I want to

16:02.996 --> 16:03.963
begin the process of conscious

16:03.997 --> 16:04.964
uncoupling with you.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.299
>> LINDSAY: No.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.935
>> PAUL: Yes, Lindsay.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.903
I want a divorce.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.609
>> BECCA: Oh. Well.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.479
Ooh. (groans)

16:19.512 --> 16:22.782
Mom is gonna be so disappointed.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.817
Guess you'd better give us the

16:24.851 --> 16:25.818
good china.

16:25.852 --> 16:26.819
>> LINDSAY: Like your marriage

16:26.853 --> 16:27.820
is so perfect.

16:27.854 --> 16:28.988
You nearly banged Jimmy last

16:29.022 --> 16:30.057
week.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.224
>> GRETCHEN: What?!

16:31.258 --> 16:33.326
>> JIMMY: Okay, just to clarify,

16:33.360 --> 16:34.961
she tried to bang me.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.129
I turned her down.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.830
Marvelously satisfying, really.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.831
>> LINDSAY: You tried to sleep

16:38.865 --> 16:39.832
with him?

16:39.866 --> 16:41.000
I thought he tried to kiss you

16:41.034 --> 16:42.469
at your house.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.137
>> JIMMY: (clears throat) Okay,

16:44.171 --> 16:45.472
that happened also.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.473
But it was... it was part of

16:46.506 --> 16:47.640
this thing where we were

16:47.674 --> 16:49.042
competing to bang our exes.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.043
>> BECCA: What is wrong with you

16:50.077 --> 16:51.044
two?!

16:51.078 --> 16:52.045
>> VERNON: You tried to bang my

16:52.079 --> 16:53.046
wife?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.047
>> JIMMY: She tried to sleep

16:54.081 --> 16:55.048
with me.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.049
>> VERNON: I let you be my

16:56.083 --> 16:57.050
forever-friend.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.051
I was gonna invite you into the

16:58.085 --> 16:59.052
man cave.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.053
>> JIMMY: I barely even know

17:00.087 --> 17:01.054
you!

17:01.088 --> 17:02.055
>> VERNON: Well, now you're

17:02.089 --> 17:04.391
gonna know... my fists and feet

17:04.424 --> 17:05.392
and stuff!

17:05.425 --> 17:06.493
>> JIMMY: Oh, shit.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.429
(grunting)

17:09.462 --> 17:11.431
>> VERNON: You British prick!

17:14.467 --> 17:16.436
>> BECCA: Vernon, get him!

17:18.538 --> 17:19.672
>> EDGAR: Go to sleep, Vernon.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.074
>> BECCA: Edgar, stop it!

17:21.108 --> 17:23.910
>> EDGAR: Go... to... sleep.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.279
>> VERNON: But I'm not sleepy.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.350
>> BECCA: Oh, God.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.352
Get away from him.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.187
Vernon. Vernon.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.555
>> GUEST: Okay, bye, Becca.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.090
Congratulations.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.091
>> BECCA: Wouldn't it...

17:38.125 --> 17:39.092
No, no, no.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.360
No, you c... you can't go.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.694
Hey, no, no.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.729
Where are you going?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.131
Hey, no, no.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.065
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.534
You...

17:47.567 --> 17:49.402
This is my night!

17:53.005 --> 17:53.973
>> JIMMY: Has anyone seen

17:54.006 --> 17:54.807
Gretchen?

17:54.841 --> 17:55.742
>> BRIANNA: Oh, sorry, Jimmy,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.877
but I think she left.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.612
(Jimmy sighs)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.080
>> TOMMY: Hey, Jimmy.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.315
You want in on this?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.284
>> JIMMY: Uh, no, but have fun.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.053
Listen.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.054
I will kill you if you tell him

18:08.087 --> 18:09.922
I said so, but Edgar is one of

18:09.956 --> 18:11.158
the few genuinely decent people

18:11.191 --> 18:12.225
on this planet.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.393
You're lucky to be his friend.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.427
>> TOMMY: Oh, I'm not his

18:14.461 --> 18:15.228
friend.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.429
He cleans toilets at my gym.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.630
>> JIMMY: Edgar got a job?

18:17.664 --> 18:18.898
>> TOMMY: I felt really bad

18:18.931 --> 18:20.066
about lying to him when we first

18:20.099 --> 18:21.268
met, so I agreed to help him out

18:21.301 --> 18:22.469
today.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.470
(Scottish accent): Plus,

18:23.503 --> 18:24.737
I'm great at accent work.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.273
>> JIMMY: Are you?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.274
>> TOMMY: Anyway, like I could

18:27.307 --> 18:29.075
really be friends with someone

18:29.108 --> 18:31.043
who lives in their car.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.188
>> JIMMY: Hey.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.757
>> EDGAR: Hey.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.992
Uh, so, uh, uh, h-how have

18:46.025 --> 18:46.993
you been?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.295
>> JIMMY: Not well.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.296
I haven't been feeding myself

18:49.329 --> 18:50.297
properly.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.498
>> EDGAR: I told you before I

18:51.531 --> 18:52.499
left, the menus are in a blue

18:52.532 --> 18:53.766
binder in the bottom drawer.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.934
>> JIMMY: Listen, maybe...

18:54.967 --> 18:56.636
Could you move back in?

18:56.669 --> 18:57.837
I...

18:57.870 --> 18:59.606
You'd be doing me a favor.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.607
>> EDGAR: I have a job now,

19:00.640 --> 19:01.608
Jimmy.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.775
I'm making great progress.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.943
I can't go backwards.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.613
If I move back in, I'm paying

19:06.646 --> 19:07.614
rent, and I'm not cooking for

19:07.647 --> 19:08.615
you anymore.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.616
>> JIMMY: Market value for your

19:09.649 --> 19:10.783
bedroom is $1,200 a month.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.951
>> EDGAR: I will do some light

19:11.984 --> 19:13.119
housework.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.321
>> JIMMY: Thanks.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.522
>> EDGAR: Oh, hey, uh...

19:15.555 --> 19:16.456
>> JIMMY: Hey, coming up.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.425
>> EDGAR: Oh.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.043
(knocking)

19:39.846 --> 19:40.813
>> GRETCHEN: Why can't you just

19:40.847 --> 19:41.814
let this be over?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.082
>> JIMMY: Because I can't.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.517
Look, I don't know why I

19:44.551 --> 19:45.652
proposed to Becca.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.019
It is a giant mystery, fueled

19:47.053 --> 19:48.655
mostly by my desire to make up

19:48.688 --> 19:50.490
for my wretched family and the

19:50.523 --> 19:51.491
fact that she gives spectacular

19:51.524 --> 19:52.492
blow jobs.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.660
>> GRETCHEN: Really?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.827
>> JIMMY: Yeah, I do not know

19:54.861 --> 19:55.995
what's going on with that mouth.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.196
She's like a human Brookstone

19:57.230 --> 19:58.398
massage chair.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.666
>> GRETCHEN: I am completely

19:59.699 --> 20:00.833
stunned by this information.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.502
>> JIMMY: Maybe the sour face

20:02.535 --> 20:04.003
creates extra suction.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.406
Look, Becca was a choice.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.008
A dumb choice, but a choice.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.177
You and I-- we're inevitable.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.178
>> GRETCHEN: Words, man.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.179
You got a lot of pretty words,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.180
but that doesn't mean...

20:14.213 --> 20:15.382
>> JIMMY: Shut up.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.583
I'm not done.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.085
Let's be those pit bulls.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.688
I want to be your couch bud.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.956
Move in with me.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.091
(Gretchen groans)

20:25.124 --> 20:26.092
(key clinks on floor)

20:26.125 --> 20:27.093
>> JIMMY: Sorry. Why'd you do

20:27.126 --> 20:28.094
that?

20:28.127 --> 20:29.095
>> GRETCHEN: I just humiliated

20:29.128 --> 20:30.363
myself by accepting your

20:30.397 --> 20:31.364
non-marriage proposal.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.865
I cannot now move in with you.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.200
>> JIMMY: Yeah, but I'm... I'm

20:34.233 --> 20:35.868
actually asking you this time.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.036
>> GRETCHEN: Bullshit.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.538
You're just doing this as a Hail

20:38.571 --> 20:39.539
Mary because you know you're

20:39.572 --> 20:40.540
about to lose me for good.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.541
>> JIMMY: No, no, no! I was...

20:41.574 --> 20:42.542
I was going to ask you at the

20:42.575 --> 20:43.543
party.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.077
I had the key made yesterday.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.781
Look, my entire life, I've been

20:48.815 --> 20:50.417
obsessed with trying to live the

20:50.450 --> 20:52.719
life of a writer-- just full of

20:52.752 --> 20:55.288
loneliness and suffering.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.557
But over the last two weeks,

20:57.590 --> 21:01.227
what I have finally realized is

21:01.260 --> 21:03.730
that the worst possible draft of

21:03.763 --> 21:06.833
my life is the one without you

21:06.866 --> 21:08.301
in it.

21:08.335 --> 21:11.904
I hate it, Gretchen Cutler, but

21:11.938 --> 21:14.707
you goddamn floor me.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.688
>> GRETCHEN: No.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.225
Not yet.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.697
>> JIMMY: Okay.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.934
Okay.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.372
(Gretchen sighs)

21:45.405 --> 21:47.540
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, shit.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.108
We're gonna do this.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.276
>> JIMMY: Yeah.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.444
Shit.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.445
>> GRETCHEN: We're gonna do

21:52.479 --> 21:53.680
this, even though we know there

21:53.713 --> 21:55.848
is only one way this ends.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.984
Whether in a week or 20 years.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.118
There is horrible sadness and

21:59.151 --> 22:00.787
pain coming, and we're inviting

22:00.820 --> 22:02.655
it.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.290
>> JIMMY: God, I love the way

22:04.323 --> 22:06.258
you think.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.503
(fire crackling)

22:16.536 --> 22:18.505
(smoke alarm beeping)

22:26.846 --> 22:28.548
*

22:28.581 --> 22:32.351
>> LINDSAY: * Oh, oh-ooh

22:32.385 --> 22:34.353
Ooh *

22:37.557 --> 22:41.260
* Pray God you can cope

22:41.293 --> 22:45.231
I stand outside

22:45.264 --> 22:47.567
This woman's work

22:47.600 --> 22:50.703
* This woman's world

22:50.737 --> 22:54.206
Ooh, it's hard on the man

22:54.240 --> 22:57.910
Now his part is over

22:57.944 --> 23:02.048
* Now starts the craft

23:02.081 --> 23:07.019
Of the father

23:07.053 --> 23:09.388
I know you have a little life

23:09.422 --> 23:11.257
* In you yet

23:11.290 --> 23:12.759
I know you have a lot

23:12.792 --> 23:14.894
Of strength left

23:14.927 --> 23:17.363
* I know you have a little life

23:17.396 --> 23:18.898
In you yet

23:18.931 --> 23:20.700
I know you have a lot

23:20.733 --> 23:22.602
* Of strength left

23:22.635 --> 23:23.736
I should be crying

23:23.770 --> 23:26.372
But I just can't let it show
