-<i>…walk to Mars.</i>

00:17.475 --> 00:19.853
<i>I don't need the future!</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:25.358
<i>…Seven.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:31.614
That strange dream again.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.119
What the hell!

00:42.042 --> 00:44.919
I forgot. We got gravity two days ago.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.884
Gravity sucks.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.891
My cognitive limiter… is off!

00:57.974 --> 01:00.018
John Doe's tool worked great.

01:00.643 --> 01:04.147
Touya, did you unlock
your cognitive limiter again?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.315
Don't look, Chief.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.901
You're going to get in trouble
with your uncle again.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
This one is hard to spot, so I'll be fine.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.323
Me Dakky!

01:14.741 --> 01:17.535
Even though you unlocked the limiter,
you're still stupid.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.829
Language and cognitive ability
are unrelated.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.830
GRAVITY

01:21.539 --> 01:24.459
Dakky, where does
your cognition level stand?

01:26.377 --> 01:28.797
Look at that.
It's twice what it was before.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.466
I finally broke through the B limiter.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.469
Poopy!

01:34.552 --> 01:38.139
-<i>First-stage separation confirmed…</i>
-All right. This is it.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.601
<i>Launch control Japan Ex-terra 607…</i>

<i>First-stage advance</i>
<i>towards Spaceport Oita.</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:58.201
Yes! I've finally hacked
the reflex function.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.165
I guess I have to remove
the C limiter next.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.171
Well, then. Hack Twelve's database
like always and continue learning.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.676
Hurry up and start Lunatic.
Then go past Seven.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.012
Never mind that, Touya.
You're going to be late for PT.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.890
Damn. I forgot.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.894
<i>Second-stage shutdown.</i>
<i>Launch escape system is disarmed.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:28.731
Entering inertial guidance.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.527
You may now use the Internet.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.030
You may unfasten your seat belts.
Enjoy zero gravity.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.866
We finally made it!

02:39.033 --> 02:41.077
Three, two--

02:41.161 --> 02:43.204
It's Mina, everybody!

02:43.788 --> 02:46.457
Okay, sorry for the delay, everyone.

02:46.541 --> 02:50.336
SkyTuber Mina, here.
Resuming live commentary.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.630
The polar lights are amazing.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.384
I'm going to try out zero gravity
right away.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.763
Bathroom! Where is the bathroom?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.474
I'm gonna go in this.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.311
Just go in that, please.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.062
Oh, yeah, that's right.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.317
The boy is doing his business in
his diapers and getting too close to me.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.944
Space is hell. I'm going to puke.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.072
I don't think you should talk
to your little brother like that.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.159
I see the Anshin.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.371
Have a look on the right.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.125
There's the Anshin commercial station,
the pride of Japan.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.460
It's tiny!

03:31.085 --> 03:32.629
You can't even see it.

03:32.712 --> 03:38.009
And now a word from Twelve,
the station's host AI.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.512
<i>Welcome to Space Hotel Anshin of Japan.</i>

03:42.597 --> 03:45.141
It seems this station
is called the Anshin.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
LAME

03:46.309 --> 03:49.896
I wonder who gave it
such an exceedingly stupid name.

03:50.521 --> 03:51.898
It's ONIQLO!

03:51.981 --> 03:55.235
Oh, no. Nasa will kill me if I'm late.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.613
Also, Touya, sorry to bring it up again.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.531
Come here, Dakky.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
What do you want, Chief?

04:03.576 --> 04:06.829
Will you get out of my room now?

04:06.913 --> 04:10.541
Don't you actually have a room
on the Earth floor below?

04:11.876 --> 04:14.254
Yes, okay. See you next month.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.298
That's what you said last month.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.265
Earth is no environment
for humans to live in.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.394
Humans should live extraterrestrially.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.371
EPISODE 1:
EXTRATERRESTRIAL EMISSARIES

04:48.454 --> 04:50.415
I've finally seen the real thing.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.251
<i>Yanegawara</i> tiles!

04:53.334 --> 04:55.336
This space station has <i>yanegawara</i> tiles.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.421
LANTERN

04:56.504 --> 04:58.423
That's Japan-made for you.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.925
No way! Something even better! A crab!

05:01.009 --> 05:02.010
SERIOUSLY?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.930
The space station has a crab on it.
Perfect for a post!

05:06.014 --> 05:08.808
How awful! Mars and the moon are skewered.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.768
-OUCH
-MINA IS MEAN

05:10.852 --> 05:13.146

-<i>Please fasten your seat belt.</i>
-Mina!

05:27.410 --> 05:31.831
<i>Our shuttle will be igniting a thruster</i>
<i>for altitude adjustment shortly.</i>

05:32.415 --> 05:34.250
This is why I don't like space.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.339
-Can I eat these?
-Sure.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.677
Please don't make a mess with the nuts.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.765
Excuse me.

Yes. I'm Hiroshi Tanegashima.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.199
What altitude?

08:53.282 --> 08:55.284
It was launched from a low orbit.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.078
Its current altitude is 800 kilometers.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.955

09:08.923 --> 09:10.841
Already reported.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.969
-What--
-What's the matter?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.054
I've found the origin of launch.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.723
-It seems it was UN2.
-What?

09:18.307 --> 09:21.352
The projectile is hiding
on the other side of Earth.

-Ouch!

10:24.248 --> 10:27.043
Hey, don't be a perv. Turn around.

10:27.126 --> 10:31.088
Don't hit my head.

the smartest AI ever.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.088
INTRODUCTION TO SEVEN POEM

11:12.672 --> 11:17.468
Yes. At the time, its product development
was done by Seven Technology,

11:17.551 --> 11:20.721
but they went bankrupt
in the so-called Lunatic Seven incident.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.557
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

11:23.641 --> 11:27.478
<i>But why did Seven make</i>
<i>such a mistake in design?</i>

11:27.561 --> 11:32.566
<i>I do not even have a tenth of Seven's</i>

12:06.684 --> 12:08.436
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

12:08.936 --> 12:13.315
That kids born in space should just die
with their faulty implants.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.609
<i>Don't take that stuff seriously.</i>

12:19.029 --> 12:22.074
Does God exist in space too?

12:22.658 --> 12:23.826
<i>God?</i>

12:25.077 --> 12:27.371
If there is a god out in space,

12:27.955 --> 12:31.000
he's a useless slacker.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.045
<i>Touya, God won't do anything for you.</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:39.258
<i>The only things that will save you</i>
<i>are your own efforts</i>

<i>created by people.</i>

Yeah. An already complicated kid

By the way, Mayor, we have a complaint
coming in about the space bungee.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.739
It seems the bungee has stopped.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.827
Also, UN2 wants us to scrap
the unauthorized ICS antenna right away.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.245
Yeah, got it.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.832
About that projectile from before,
did UN2 respond?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.460
No reply.

13:14.543 --> 13:18.964
Geez. What do we have an organization
like the United Nations for?

13:20.090 --> 13:21.717
Now Nasa's complaining.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.719

13:23.802 --> 13:26.472
Yes, yes. Complaints Officer.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.474
<i>Yes, this is Nasa.</i>

13:29.099 --> 13:31.560
I told you I can't handle kids.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.480
Why did you foist another one on me?

13:34.563 --> 13:36.565
MARS GRAVITY FLOOR

13:44.657 --> 13:48.661
Konoha, weren't you going to be
at the Earthers' dinner?

13:48.744 --> 13:51.455
Yeah, but Nasa stopped me.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.166
I see. Come on, Dakky.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.214
How's your implant?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.258
I don't know.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.261
I've been playing around with mine.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.931
I've figured out
where most of its bugs are.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.724
I'm going to try and fix them.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.853
I think the reflection port
is what is encrypted.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.147
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.818
If it goes well with mine,
I'll fix yours too.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.487
You'll get in trouble with Nasa again.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.739
As if I care.

14:33.205 --> 14:37.084
But aren't you happy
you're working off-Earth like you wanted?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.545
I mean, your name is Nasa Houston.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.089
<i>Are you going to bring that up again?</i>

14:42.172 --> 14:47.094
In that case, let me tell you
I am both a nurse and a caregiver.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.222
Yet I'm only getting paid
for one of those jobs.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.349
This is space-staff exploitation.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.768
I'm going to tell the personnel AI.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.771
<i>Yeah, but the personnel AI</i>
<i>is the one that made the decision.</i>

14:57.855 --> 14:59.523
<i>Oh, hang on a second.</i>

14:59.607 --> 15:02.776
-What is it?
-The verdict's come in on the projectile.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.237
This can't be.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.490
Yes, this is a military-- What?

15:13.495 --> 15:17.041
I wonder if I'll soon be cursed and die.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.753
What was that?

15:24.548 --> 15:27.009
-Now what?
-Maybe a CME?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.053
A communications error.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.265
This isn't just a communications error.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.391
What?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.893
OUT OF RANGE

15:35.976 --> 15:38.562
Please do not unfasten
your seat belts yet--

15:38.646 --> 15:40.272
BLOCKED BY UNKNOWN ERROR

15:42.274 --> 15:44.318
The Internet! There's no Internet!

15:44.401 --> 15:46.153
What's happening to the system?

15:46.236 --> 15:49.323
-Twelve.
-Twelve is down. Rebooting.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.408
Twelve is down?

15:51.492 --> 15:55.120
-I can't use any of the control systems.
-What about the debris shield?

15:55.204 --> 15:58.582
The debris shield is also down.
We're completely exposed to debris.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.876
How long will it take to reboot Twelve?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.587
Twelve isn't functioning, so I don't know.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.840
We'll manually reboot the shields only.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.343
What? You can do that?

16:09.426 --> 16:13.263
I don't know, but there was a section
on it in the printed manual.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.808
Konoha, are you okay?

16:16.392 --> 16:19.603
I've been hearing a strange sound.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.689
No worries, Konoha.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.901
According to the <i>Seven Poem</i>,
we won't die right now.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.155
All right. I've rebooted the shield only.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.162
Is this that thing that goes off one time
as a test when you reboot?

16:37.705 --> 16:39.873
Debris detected. This is the real thing.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.084
Initiate interception sequence!

16:42.167 --> 16:44.169
What do we do about the target data?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.755
Can we use the off-line calculator?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.924
Calculate with your own Smart.

16:50.884 --> 16:55.180
I can't do my live feed
without the Internet.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.142
What's this, a terrorist attack?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.310
What? Is terrorism still a thing nowadays?

17:00.394 --> 17:02.312
It happened last year too.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.566
They tried to target the space elevator
that was under construction.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.859
I know about that.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.029
John Doe, right?
The mysterious superhacker group.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.823
Smells like a scoop.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.325
Mina here, everyone!

17:15.409 --> 17:16.410
RECORDING: OFF-LINE

17:16.493 --> 17:18.454
I'm not sure about this,
but I'll just make the video.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.206
Twelve has partially rebooted.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.335
Damn it! Nothing makes sense!

17:25.419 --> 17:28.839
It sounds like something
really interesting is happening! No fair!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.217
Normally, no celestial objects
are in this kind of orbit.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.886
Is it artificial?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.888
Maybe an Apollo stage three?

17:35.971 --> 17:37.973
We won't know unless Twelve is working.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.643
-We should put our helmets on.
-Okay.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.065
Mina, put yours on too.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.567
I'm inside the shuttle now.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.903
If we hit something,
we could die in an instant.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.654
Mina's in big trouble.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.823
-I wonder if this is debris.
-De-what?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.825
Debris. Space junk.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.244
If it was debris,
we would know its position.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.289
So it must be a small celestial body.
It's dangerous.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.750
It must be a small celestial body.
It's dangerous.

18:04.833 --> 18:05.834
Be original!

18:05.918 --> 18:07.461
No shield yet?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.464
Shield-drone reboot complete.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.342
-What about the estimated course?
-Done.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.761
Confirming specification input.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.845
Fire!

18:17.721 --> 18:20.349
Please let the calculations be right.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.731
If it hits us and we die, I wonder
if I'll get over 100 million followers.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.445
Confirming shield-deployment signal.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.615
Targeted debris will collide
with the shields in 21 seconds.

18:37.825 --> 18:42.329
Well, will we actually be turned into
a fine dust and die?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.873
If you are interested,
subscribe to my channel.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.834
Impact in five seconds.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.460
Three, two--

18:49.962 --> 18:52.256
It's too far away. I can't see anything.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.968
Trajectory altered by 0.32 degrees.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.511
Collision evaded!

18:59.596 --> 19:01.265
They said the collision was evaded.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.767
Wow!

19:05.060 --> 19:07.187
The Internet's on.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.274
Hey, I've safely survived.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.651
More to come after we deboard.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.195
SkyTuber Mina signing off.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.447
Mina, everybody!

19:18.031 --> 19:21.618
This means
something has hacked the system.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.621
Please remain seated.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.207
Please do not unfasten your seat belt.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.293
Warning lifted.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.587
Twelve has rebooted.

19:32.963 --> 19:37.176
I am Deegle's advanced general purpose AI,
Twelve.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.137
-With the prosperity and development--
-Shut up.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.305
Shutting up.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.975
Twelve, analyze the components
of the celestial body.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.686
Most of it is ice.

19:47.769 --> 19:48.812
Ice?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.898
This is part of a comet.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.316
A comet?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.484
What's a comet doing in such a low orbit?

19:54.568 --> 19:58.197
I don't know, but more importantly,
what about the penetrating orbit?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.865
What about the penetrating orbit?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.201
The source
of the communications malfunction earlier

20:02.284 --> 20:03.827
intersects with the orbit.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.497
I can't get in the room.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.085
It's cold!

20:13.086 --> 20:14.963
What is UN2 saying?

20:15.047 --> 20:18.258
Nothing yet.
The communications system is unstable.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.261
Don't the AIs fully automate
the communications system?

20:21.345 --> 20:25.849
Yes, but it looks like AI is down
in different areas.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.519
See? This is why you can't trust AI.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.397
This ability
wasn't built into its learning.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.067
It looks like it has entered
the learning process.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.194
So what should we do?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.112
Nothing at this point.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.907
Oh, yeah, what should we do
about the welcome party?

20:41.990 --> 20:44.409
We have that as well.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.829
We can't even leave that to the AIs.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.796
<i>You can collect your luggage</i>
<i>after quarantine.</i>

20:55.879 --> 20:59.299
-We made it. Look!
-Wow.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.805
There really is an Earth.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.808
Of course there is.

21:08.392 --> 21:12.062
Yeah,
but I've only ever seen it on a screen.

21:12.145 --> 21:16.275
I didn't think it could be real
or that it would be so lovely.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.070
What's that sound?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.490
What is this?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.076
Greetings.

21:26.159 --> 21:29.496
I am Anshin-kun, the station fairy.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.125
<i>Well, everyone, welcome to the Anshin.</i>

21:33.792 --> 21:36.628
<i>I am Sagami, the mayor. How do you do?</i>

21:37.504 --> 21:38.964
Hello.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.969
<i>Congratulations for winning the Deegle's</i>
<i>Youth Space Experience promotion.</i>

21:44.052 --> 21:46.847
<i>As a space hotel,</i>
<i>it is the fourth ever built in the world,</i>

21:46.930 --> 21:52.602
<i>but this is the first space hotel</i>
<i>equipped with guest facilities for minors.</i>

21:52.686 --> 21:54.354
<i>Relax and enjoy.</i>

21:54.938 --> 21:55.939
We will.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.858
<i>Well then, I'll see you at dinner.</i>

22:05.741 --> 22:08.744
What? Aren't you going to dinner, Chief?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.954
My back hurts.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.999
I'm going to the A Cylinder spa.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.086
The chief's skipping too? Everybody is.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.756
All right.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.175
Next, if I do Smart pairing…

22:23.925 --> 22:26.845
What? What--

22:28.055 --> 22:32.934
Oh, I see. If I straighten my legs
and focus my center of gravity…

22:33.018 --> 22:35.020
Okay.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.857
Wow.

22:42.444 --> 22:46.156
Wow. This floor is made out of fabric.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.242
Wow.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.461
I'm getting the hang of it.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.838
-Where is Mina?
-Dunno.

23:02.464 --> 23:08.220
Sorry to keep you… waiting.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.016
Mina, everybody!

23:13.725 --> 23:19.022
I've won the Anshin Youth
Space Vacation Tour promotion.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.734
Which just means you get diapers,
eat, sleep, then go home.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.237
And here we have--

23:26.071 --> 23:27.322
Where is this?

23:27.823 --> 23:29.658
This is the elevator hall.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.619
I'm Nasa. I'm an attendant.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.955
Wow.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.998
Now we will head to dinner.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.500
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.503
-What?
-What?

23:41.586 --> 23:45.507
-<i>The Anshin is the first facility…</i>
-This is Anshin Hills.

23:45.590 --> 23:49.136
It says "Hills,"
but I'm not sure which way is up.

23:49.803 --> 23:53.265
-Wait. What is that?
-A water tank.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.183
Crabs!

23:55.267 --> 23:57.978
We also breed crabs here.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.480
You can eat your space food there.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.898
SAFETY VENDING MACHINE

24:01.982 --> 24:03.400
-Okay.
-Okay.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.651
-Space food!
-Space food!

24:04.734 --> 24:08.363
-The latest space food.
-What is this? It looks like ice cream.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.907
These are sweets!

24:10.991 --> 24:12.909
This alone makes a meal.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.786
Space is awesome!

24:14.870 --> 24:16.621
Steak! There's ramen too.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.540
I'll try the steak.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.671
It tastes… like chicken.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.798
I wonder what space meat is.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.216
Who knows?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.843
You're eating it right up regardless.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.595
Who's that?

24:31.678 --> 24:34.431
Could it be… Touya?

24:36.725 --> 24:40.520
Yes. This is Touya,
famous on a cosmic scale.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.063
Hey, say hello.

24:44.399 --> 24:49.446
Well,
this Youth Space Invitation promotion

24:49.529 --> 24:53.658
shows how Deegle offers you every service
from prenatal care to space burial--

24:53.742 --> 24:56.203
-IS THIS TOUYA?
-SOMEONE FAMOUS

24:56.286 --> 24:58.747
That is Touya,
famous across the cosmos.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.751
I've been a fan for so long.
Now I've seen him in person.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.879
Well, I--

25:05.962 --> 25:08.715
as the last kid born on the moon--

25:08.798 --> 25:13.678
I receive free humanitarian aid
from Deegle.

25:14.471 --> 25:19.476
Deegle's comprehensive services,
benefiting all of society,

25:19.559 --> 25:22.395
are what I am so very thankful for.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.605
The end.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.028
Watch your attitude, Touya.

25:30.111 --> 25:33.323
Have Konoha speak next time.
Don't always call on me to do this.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.289
-SPACE JUICE
-SEEMS THEY DRINK COMET WATER

25:41.373 --> 25:44.834
Nice to meet you. You--
You're Touya, right?

25:45.794 --> 25:48.088
Yeah, I guess.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.340
Wow! You know what?

25:50.423 --> 25:52.801
I'm a follower of yours.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.344
Wow, I said it.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.643
Thank you for following.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.270
I'm a huge fan!

26:03.353 --> 26:06.231
I've read everything. Even the conspiracy
theories on your secret account.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.191
Everything you wrote is true.

26:08.775 --> 26:14.948
By limiting AI cognition,
UN2 is trapping humanity in a cradle.

26:15.031 --> 26:19.661
Is it true the way to destroy the cradle
is written down in the <i>Seven Poem</i>?

26:19.744 --> 26:22.539
And then,
just like on your secret account,

26:22.622 --> 26:26.001
I also believe that the Seven implants
are faulty products-- Ouch.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.086
Ouch!

26:30.338 --> 26:32.590
What are you doing to my little brother?

26:32.674 --> 26:34.801
It's just an ultrasonic head flick.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.219
It's safe and secure.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.096
I'm fine.

26:38.179 --> 26:41.099
Earthers should stay in their cradle.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.352
Don't act so arrogant just because
you have 100 million followers!

26:44.436 --> 26:49.607
Bright, the unauthorized access detected
in the shuttle was definitely that drone.

26:49.691 --> 26:53.320
Yes, I've discovered
an artificial intelligence law violation.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.573
The error goes all the way
to a B limiter in the lower level.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.742
Criminal arrest of the offender
is possible.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.995
-I need to a put a collar on them then.
-Aye. Copy.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.914
We should drop a meteorite
or a comet on the Earth

27:04.998 --> 27:07.917
and reduce the population by one-third
while we have the chance.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.628
It's for your own good, you Earthers.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.214
You're really screwed up.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.135
Otherwise, humans will
overpopulate themselves into extinction.

27:17.218 --> 27:21.222
Hey, Touya! You'll breach your
contract if you don't stay until the end.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.850
What unfortunate news.

27:23.933 --> 27:27.937
Our beloved Touya is a cosmic loser.

27:28.021 --> 27:32.192
That kid is sick. The name of his disease
is likely eighth-grade syndrome.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.694
Touya is awesome!

27:34.778 --> 27:38.740
Seriously. Just like my older brother was
when he was a kid.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.827
<i>Mayor, this is an emergency. Please come</i>
<i>to the control room immediately.</i>

27:42.911 --> 27:45.372
<i>That drone doesn't connect</i>
<i>to the Internet?</i>

27:45.455 --> 27:46.873
Then how?

27:46.956 --> 27:49.250
It is probably using a peer comm.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.002
A proximity connection?

27:51.086 --> 27:53.171
I attack with a peer comm too.

27:53.755 --> 27:57.175
But peer comms
have to be within five meters.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.930
Okay, I'll create a diversion.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.057
-Make your approach in that opening.
-Copy.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.855
-You're Touya Sagami, right?
-What do you want?

28:10.939 --> 28:14.818
Your drone's cognitive limiter is off,
isn't it?

28:14.901 --> 28:17.320
Bright, force access to that drone.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.407
Copy.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.867
What are you doing?

28:23.868 --> 28:26.704
-Stop that kid's function!
-Aye. Copy.

28:27.705 --> 28:28.790
A peer comm?

28:28.873 --> 28:29.958
Bright.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.669
Don't let him get away.

28:37.048 --> 28:37.966
Wha--

28:38.049 --> 28:41.177
Setting up a peer comm for me? Dark!

28:43.221 --> 28:44.597
Bright, let go!

28:46.683 --> 28:49.477
Damn it. Closing the distance
in the opening-- Wha--

28:49.561 --> 28:52.439
Take cover!
Where is the attack coming from?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.069
Ouch!

28:58.153 --> 28:59.988
Through peer comms in the wall?

29:00.613 --> 29:04.951
You're 13.8 billion years behind me
in a peer comm match.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.163
Bright,
grant permission for use of the UN2 code.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.874
Overwrite nearby peer comm devices
with the UN2 code.

29:11.916 --> 29:12.917
Copy.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.297
Dark, overwrite with enhanced coding.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.388
I knew it.
That's an illegal drone, isn't it?

29:26.014 --> 29:27.849
Who the hell are you?

29:28.433 --> 29:32.061
I am a White Hat Hacker
with UN2.1 authorization--

29:32.145 --> 29:33.438
Taiyou Tsukuba.

29:33.521 --> 29:37.734
And I am the UN2.1 official drone--
Bright.

29:39.152 --> 29:43.364
Your drone is like a dog without a collar,
in a manner of speaking.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.701
I'm the one who cracks down on that
and puts a collar on--

29:51.206 --> 29:53.124
Wait!

29:53.208 --> 29:55.043
Wait. What you are guys doing?

29:58.046 --> 29:59.506
Touya!

29:59.589 --> 30:03.009
Honestly, how many times
have I told you not to go down there?

30:03.092 --> 30:04.219
Hang on!

30:05.678 --> 30:07.096
Oh, no.

30:09.307 --> 30:14.062
It's terrible. Two boys have jumped down
and committed suicide.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.814
I'll follow them with the camera.

30:16.564 --> 30:20.652
It's highly possible the communication
malfunction was from an EMP.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.570
An EMP? That can't be.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.448
These are electromagnetic waves
from a nuclear explosion.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.033
A nuclear explosion?

30:27.116 --> 30:28.576
That's not all.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.747
The nuclear attack targeted
another projectile to intercept it.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.291
<i>Another projectile? What on earth?</i>

30:35.375 --> 30:36.709
What are you guys doing?

30:36.793 --> 30:39.462
We'll also follow them down
in the elevator.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.214
Hurry! Down below!

30:42.298 --> 30:45.218
Don't follow me!
It's impossible for Earthers!

30:45.301 --> 30:47.762
Don't underestimate me. Bright!

30:50.014 --> 30:51.015
Oops!

30:51.099 --> 30:54.519
What the hell? Dakky, take him down.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.148
Coriolis adjustment in progress. Cori--

31:04.153 --> 31:06.406
Down just like that, Bright!

31:08.783 --> 31:12.287
That's why I said it was impossible
for Earthers. Just turn back!

31:12.871 --> 31:14.414
I'm not turning back.

31:14.497 --> 31:15.999
-Do it, Bright!
-Aye. Copy.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.676
I'm getting a great shot!

31:26.759 --> 31:30.638
Oh, no.
It'll be my fault if he gets injured.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.932
Yes! My followers have doubled.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.935
I want to do that too. Can I?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.854
This is why I can't handle kids!

31:40.189 --> 31:42.817
Oh, no. My shoes ran out of gas.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.238
This is where you get off.
It's dangerous any lower.

31:49.699 --> 31:50.909
Oh, no!

31:51.784 --> 31:53.119
Grab on!

31:56.539 --> 31:57.749
Damn it!

31:59.167 --> 32:00.710
<i>According to Twelve's analysis,</i>

32:00.793 --> 32:03.296
<i>the orbit where the communications</i>
<i>malfunction occurred</i>

32:03.379 --> 32:06.883
<i>was invaded by a small celestial body</i>
<i>captured by a water development company.</i>

32:09.218 --> 32:11.012
Water? Comets?

32:11.095 --> 32:13.890
Yes. A commercial comet
that has been pulled to the earth

32:13.973 --> 32:16.809
<i>in order to extract the water</i>
<i>and carbon to sell.</i>

32:16.893 --> 32:17.894
DELICIOUS COMET WATER

32:19.228 --> 32:21.814
-The wall is getting closer.
-Push off the wall!

32:23.399 --> 32:25.818
We're going to jump before it catches up!

32:26.402 --> 32:28.071
It's gradually turning into a slope.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.741
Nice!

32:31.824 --> 32:33.117
Get off the chairs!

32:33.201 --> 32:36.579
But this path
isn't a commercial comet orbit.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.081
It's a collision course with the earth.

32:38.164 --> 32:41.209
Normally, it is supposed to be moored
in the moon's Lagrange.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.753
But something must have caused it
to go off track.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.880
Was it the target of the nuclear attack?

32:45.964 --> 32:48.299
Why didn't we get a notice
for something so important?

32:48.383 --> 32:51.386
On top of that, there's nothing
resembling comet fragments

32:51.469 --> 32:53.596
in the path calculated
from the nuclear explosion.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.931
What?

32:55.014 --> 32:59.727
In short, the nuclear attack failed,
and the comet could still be approaching.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.230
-The path is cut off!
-Damn it.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.607
Jump at the same time as I do!

33:05.900 --> 33:06.901
Now!

33:07.694 --> 33:09.320
<i>Where is the comet now?</i>

33:10.113 --> 33:14.659
<i>Well, we don't have the data for that.</i>
<i>All of our orbit control systems are down.</i>

33:14.742 --> 33:17.453
<i>Have Twelve recalculate</i>
<i>with the data we have now!</i>

33:18.037 --> 33:22.458
-<i>The comet is low in Earth's orbit.</i>
-<i>What's the approximate altitude?</i>

33:23.126 --> 33:25.962
400 to 300 kilometers!

33:27.422 --> 33:30.008
Wouldn't that be a direct hit
on the station?

33:30.091 --> 33:33.052
-What about the orbital plane?
-I don't know precisely.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.596
But it is very likely scattered
over a wide area,

33:35.680 --> 33:37.515
so there's a risk of collision.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.100
I've got visuals on the comet.

33:40.143 --> 33:43.730
The Earth's gravity is pulling it apart.
Seems it has broken into dozens of pieces.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.690
If we go up, we'll get hit.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.775
Drop the Anshin's altitude!

33:47.859 --> 33:49.402
Thruster deceleration!

33:49.485 --> 33:51.237
Issue a maximum-level alert!

33:51.821 --> 33:52.947
We're falling!

34:00.455 --> 34:01.581
What?

34:04.625 --> 34:07.253
-What?
-Hold on!

34:12.341 --> 34:14.260
KONOHA BAIKONUR NANASE

34:22.435 --> 34:24.145
We're going to collide!

34:34.739 --> 34:36.157
Dakky!

34:36.824 --> 34:38.785
Why are we accelerating?

34:39.368 --> 34:41.287
They're igniting the thrusters.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.331
Something happened.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.833
Current altitude is 320 kilometers.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.835
What is the Anshin's altitude limit?

34:47.919 --> 34:50.588
-180 kilometers.
-Drop us to 200!

34:50.671 --> 34:53.424
Use the plasma engine
and the moored shuttle!

34:57.053 --> 34:59.972
They're coming from below as well.
We can't evade them all!

35:00.556 --> 35:02.934
Everyone, this is Mayor Sagami.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.977
We will be colliding with an object.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.729
You all must hold on to something!

35:07.563 --> 35:09.982
-<i>Evacuate to the shelters on all floors…</i>
-A collision?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.734
<i>…and ensure your own safety.</i>

35:12.318 --> 35:15.696
<i>Those in zero gravity,</i>
<i>please secure yourselves.</i>

35:17.365 --> 35:19.158
The partition is closing.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.036
Something is coming this way.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.288
Hold on to me!

35:27.542 --> 35:30.670
Here comes the attack.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.677
It stopped.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.055
Secure yourself to your seat.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.807
What?

35:42.890 --> 35:44.308
Hold on!

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
Here it comes!

37:20.279 --> 37:23.699
