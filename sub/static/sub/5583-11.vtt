WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.505
Previously on Empire...
When Hakeem wins,

00:04.538 --> 00:06.807
I get to release Jamal's next
album through Lyon Dynasty.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.975
LUCIOUS:
Bet.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.144
Times would like to do
a profile on Jamal.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.579
That's gonna be a little tricky,
isn't it?

00:11.612 --> 00:14.382
Seeing Jamal's got
a girlfriend and all.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.184
NICOLE RICHIE:
This has to be the first time

00:16.217 --> 00:17.185
in the history
of the American Sound Awards

00:17.218 --> 00:18.486
that a father and son

00:18.519 --> 00:19.753
are going toe to toe.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.422
Ain't that a bitch?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.857
Lucious is just obsessed

00:23.891 --> 00:25.593
with this grandchild.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.228
My beautiful wife,

00:27.261 --> 00:28.929
Camilla Marks Whiteman.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.064
Remember me, Lucious?

00:31.299 --> 00:32.933
You have to trust
and believe me.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.236
I can take you
to the next level, Hakeem.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.570
HAKEEM:
Think I'm in love.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.206
I ain't never feel this way
in my life.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.008
I propose a vote
to remove Lucious Lyon

00:41.041 --> 00:43.444
as chairman of Empire.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.279
Hakeem, no!

00:45.313 --> 00:46.080
Aye.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.583
(alarm blaring)
(groans)

00:49.617 --> 00:51.719
What keeps setting
this thing off?

00:51.752 --> 00:52.453
(gasps)

00:56.490 --> 00:58.492
*

01:11.172 --> 01:13.307
(groaning)

01:18.646 --> 01:20.248
(door closes)

01:23.651 --> 01:25.719
Pop.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.054
Please, will you
listen to me?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.556
This is a huge mistake.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.057
We should just...
we should get out of here.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.925
They already
called the police.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.462
This is my damn company.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.597
I built it from nothing!

01:36.630 --> 01:39.667
And I'll be damned if somebody
gonna take me away from it.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.236
Hey, Lucious, I'm down.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.237
Okay?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.105
I mean, I am down.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.007
Feel me on this.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.442
There's no doubt in my mind

01:48.476 --> 01:50.478
that that emergency vote
was unlawful.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.414
We get our hands
on the corporate charter,

01:53.447 --> 01:56.250
I bet you we'll be able
to prove that this whole

01:56.284 --> 01:57.685
Mimi/Camilla shenanigans
was illegal.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.519
Yeah, let's get the charter.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.853
It's in a safe
at our law firm.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.489
Tomorrow morning, after
we get a good night's sleep,

02:01.522 --> 02:02.823
we'll head down there,
we'll look it up.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.792
No, no, no, no.
You get the charter now.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.594
It's the middle of night, Pop;
they're closed.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.329
Excuses are the tools
of the incompetent.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.831
Doesn't help, Thirsty.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.436
Fine.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.137
If I go down there
right now,

02:17.171 --> 02:18.939
will you two please
leave the building

02:18.972 --> 02:20.274
before the cops get here?
Please.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.476
Get the charter,
'cause I ain't going nowhere.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.011
Yes, sir.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.056
(groans quietly)

02:36.089 --> 02:37.558
(weakly):
Help.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.029
(sobbing)

02:44.064 --> 02:45.799
Help.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.335
(sobs)

02:56.577 --> 02:59.247
Hey, Keem.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.249
*

03:10.224 --> 03:13.227
Why?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.529
Why would you do this
to your family?

03:15.563 --> 03:18.666
I didn't do this
to our family.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.368
I did it to him.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.237
Boy...

03:23.271 --> 03:26.607
you gave our business away to...

03:26.640 --> 03:28.876
that half-lesbian bitch.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.879
You just threw away
our legacy!

03:31.912 --> 03:34.081
And for what?

03:34.114 --> 03:36.717
Did she promise to make you CEO?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.586
No, Mom, they didn't even know
I was gonna make that decision

03:38.619 --> 03:39.853
till right before I voted.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.089
We're gonna call
another meeting,

03:42.122 --> 03:43.757
and you're gonna
take your vote back.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.760
No.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.862
From the second we started
Lyon Dynasty,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.731
Dad been trying to kick us off.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.032
He had it coming.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.003
We all got it coming,
sooner or later.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.473
But you getting ready
to have it coming now,

03:59.507 --> 04:02.142
if you don't
take your vote back.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.579
Take your vote back, Hakeem.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.415
No.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.182
Take it back!

04:10.351 --> 04:11.285
Take it back!
(groans)

04:12.320 --> 04:13.754
Take it back!

04:14.655 --> 04:16.089
Take it back!

04:16.123 --> 04:17.425
Take the damn vote back, boy!

04:17.458 --> 04:18.826
Take the vote back, Hakeem!

04:18.859 --> 04:21.194
I will kill your ass!
You hear me?!
(grunting)

04:23.831 --> 04:25.466
Our next ASA nominee

04:25.499 --> 04:28.001
received a whopping
seven nominations today.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.137
Let's hear it for that, right?
(crowd cheering)

04:30.170 --> 04:32.740
Now to end our nominee
midnight bash,

04:32.773 --> 04:36.577
performing his
ASA-nominated song "Heavy,"

04:36.610 --> 04:39.246
Jamal Lyon.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.614
(crowd cheering)

04:45.653 --> 04:47.621
Thank you.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.625
This has been kind of
the craziest day ever.

04:51.659 --> 04:55.496
Uh, I kind of thought I wasn't
gonna make it here with y'all,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.365
but my mom told me
I had to, so...

04:57.398 --> 04:59.099
(laughter)

04:59.132 --> 05:00.934
Y'all think I'm joking,
but she really did say,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.536
"Jamal, get your ass
over there." (laughs)

05:02.570 --> 05:03.537
(laughter)

05:03.571 --> 05:05.373
I know a lot of y'all

05:05.406 --> 05:07.375
have been talking about
how my dad and I

05:07.408 --> 05:09.109
have been nominated
against each other

05:09.142 --> 05:10.811
and, uh, all the craziness

05:10.844 --> 05:12.112
that's going on
with our company.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.214
But I want
to make it clear tonight

05:14.247 --> 05:17.851
that I support my father 1,000%,

05:17.885 --> 05:20.388
always and forever, so...

05:20.421 --> 05:22.155
Dad, this is for you.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.428
*

05:28.496 --> 05:30.464
* All hail the king

05:30.498 --> 05:33.000
* Yeah

05:33.033 --> 05:37.237
* They say heavy is a head
that wears the crown *

05:37.270 --> 05:41.308
* They say heavy is a head that
wears the crown *

05:41.341 --> 05:44.878
* They say heavy is a head
that wears the crown *

05:44.912 --> 05:46.980
(Rhonda sobbing)
* Always used to think

05:47.014 --> 05:49.082
* That that was just
some damn excuse *

05:49.116 --> 05:51.018
* Something that the weak say

05:51.051 --> 05:52.686
* 'Cause they couldn't
hold it down *

05:52.720 --> 05:54.555
(panting)

05:54.588 --> 05:56.023
* But now that I wear it
(sobs): Oh, no.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.158
* I know that to be true

05:58.191 --> 05:59.860
* Oh

05:59.893 --> 06:03.196
* Daddy raised a soldier
whether he knew it or not *

06:03.230 --> 06:05.566
* He supplied the pain

06:05.599 --> 06:07.601
* I put it in the music,
made it hot *

06:07.635 --> 06:10.037
* Strong back
* Strong shoulders *

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
Oh, God.
* 'Cause I'm holding up a lot

06:11.939 --> 06:14.374
* I'm underneath this bitch
supporting... *

06:14.408 --> 06:16.109
Please.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.879
Save the baby.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.681
I don't care what happens to me.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.016
* I'm the leader, damn it,
I'm the lead... *

06:23.050 --> 06:26.286
I can die a thousand times;
just please, save my baby.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.255
* Feel the real weight
of this crown *

06:28.288 --> 06:30.057
* Not just the crown

06:30.090 --> 06:33.093
* Feeling like
this whole damn kingdom's *

06:33.126 --> 06:34.528
* Sittin' on top of me, yeah

06:34.562 --> 06:36.530
* Sitting on top of me *

06:36.564 --> 06:38.566
* Sit-Sitting on top of me
(grunts loudly)

06:38.599 --> 06:40.968
* Sitting on top of me *
(glass cracks, alarm blaring)

06:41.001 --> 06:43.537
* And I'm-a carry it
on my back until victory *

06:43.571 --> 06:45.038
(alarm blaring)
* Even though this whole

06:45.072 --> 06:48.408
* Damn kingdom's
sitting on top of me. *

06:48.442 --> 06:49.910
(pounding on door)
MAN: Police!

06:49.943 --> 06:52.613
We got to get
rid of these.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.148
(pounding on door continues)

06:55.182 --> 06:56.484
MAN:
Open the door, sir!

06:56.517 --> 06:57.417
Trust me.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.154
Mr. Lyon!

07:01.188 --> 07:02.422
Okay, we are unarmed, okay?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.558
And unless you have
an arrest warrant,

07:04.592 --> 07:06.126
my client is the CEO
of this company,

07:06.159 --> 07:08.295
which means he has every right
to be in the building.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.262
Former CEO.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.100
This is a little pathetic,
don't you think, Lucious?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.802
You think this is
some kind of game?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.336
Get out of my office.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.340
Bitch, you gonna have to
drag me out of here.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.409
OFFICER:
Mr. Lyon,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.478
if you don't leave the building,
we're gonna have to arrest you

07:24.512 --> 07:26.580
for trespassing.
Trespassing?

07:26.614 --> 07:28.348
In my office?!

07:28.381 --> 07:30.784
I built this company!
Lucious!

07:30.818 --> 07:32.252
Uh, Rhonda's in the hospital.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.420
She might not make it.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.222
(heart beating)

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Code blue, Room 237.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.197
Code blue, Room 237.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.133
Look, y'all.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.638
(sniffles)
Whatever happens,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.873
we're gonna have to pull it
together before Dre gets here.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.107
Yeah.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.776
'Cause he's gonna need us, man.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.544
Yeah.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.378
(door opens)

07:58.411 --> 08:00.147
What happened?
Is she okay?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.618
You stay out of here
while we talk to your brother.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.119
Don't nobody want
to see your ass.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.256
Right now. Get out of here.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.797
Who's gonna tell him?

08:16.830 --> 08:17.965
Here he is.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.033
What happened? Is she okay?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.502
Look...

08:22.536 --> 08:23.904
I'm so sorry, son.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.905
What?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.674
There was an accident.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.676
And sometimes things don't
work out the way you want...

08:28.709 --> 08:30.477
Pop, what are you talk... What?
JAMAL: Dad, wait, wait, wait.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.179
Wait. Rhon-Rhonda's good, man.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.480
She's okay? She's okay?
Yeah, yeah. She's fine.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.848
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.818
Rhonda's fine, okay?
She's so strong.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.220
(sniffles)
But...

08:40.253 --> 08:41.989
the baby didn't make it.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.757
Andre,

08:43.791 --> 08:47.094
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Dre.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.429
I'm so sorry, but it's okay.
You guys are young.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.999
You can try again.
No, no, no. It's okay.
I don't understand.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.366
I know.
Dre.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.835
I know, baby. I know.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.403
I know, I know,
I know.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.738
It's gonna be okay. Okay...
Where-where is she?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.439
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can't go in there like that!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.842
No, just... I just want to
see her. Get your hands off me!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.510
(overlapping shouting)

09:03.543 --> 09:06.780
Dre! Dre!
Get off me! Get off me!

09:06.814 --> 09:08.882
They gonna come
take you away, Dre. Stop.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.117
LUCIOUS: Dre!
ANDRE: Let me go!

09:10.150 --> 09:11.885
Dre!
Let me go! (sobbing)

09:14.554 --> 09:15.923
(sighs)

09:15.956 --> 09:18.592
I just don't get it.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.795
I don't know
what happened.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.530
I must have slipped
or something.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.399
I don't know.
I'm so sorry, Andre.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.901
It's all my fault.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.737
It was an accident.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.939
Don't blame
yourself for this.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.474
(gasps, sighs)

09:34.507 --> 09:37.077
Don't blame yourself
for this, baby.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.580
When I was lying
on the ground there,

09:40.614 --> 09:43.651
I thought for sure
I was gonna die,

09:43.684 --> 09:47.554
so I just...
started praying

09:47.587 --> 09:50.824
that God would save
the baby.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.592
(sniffles)

09:52.626 --> 09:56.630
And then moonlight came in
through the window, and I...

09:56.664 --> 09:59.266
I swear, I thought he answered.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.168
God saved you.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.436
No.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.074
No.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.843
Andre, no. Uh...

10:09.877 --> 10:11.211
God doesn't exist.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.784
Don't say that, Rhonda.

10:16.817 --> 10:20.187
If he did...

10:20.220 --> 10:23.423
then... the baby
would still be here.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.459
He didn't do anything
to anyone.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.961
(crying)

10:29.797 --> 10:32.132
There really is no God, Andre.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.735
(sobbing)

10:36.069 --> 10:38.471
(sobbing continues)

10:49.016 --> 10:51.018
Lucious?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.990
Lucious?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.597
Lucious?

11:07.534 --> 11:09.837
Hey.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.272
You okay?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.890
(sighs)

11:42.202 --> 11:45.205
(quiet clicking)

11:49.810 --> 11:52.379
(clicking)

11:54.748 --> 11:57.084
Lucious.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.852
The hell are you doing?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.288
I'm gonna take
my company back.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.095
I don't know how our son
turned out to be so rotten.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.662
(scoffs gently)

12:11.398 --> 12:14.968
Well, maybe the apple don't
fall too far from the tree.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.909
If he tries to
become CEO...

12:24.812 --> 12:27.614
...it ain't gonna
turn out good for him.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.449
Don't say that.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.887
I mean it, Cookie.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.422
Don't ever say that.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.657
I got another way in.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.760
I'm-a take Camilla out
from the inside.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.729
I just got to get
back into Empire.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.732
Yeah, how you
gonna get back in?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.101
You just let
Cookie handle that.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.837
Just give me two days

12:49.870 --> 12:52.072
before you go and do something
you gonna regret forever.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.640
(gun clicks)

12:53.673 --> 12:55.442
You got 48 hours.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.345
Bye.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.448
Put that damn thing away.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.827
Look at this, it's fabulous.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.362
This is our new clothing line.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.930
Yeah.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.665
I'm so sorry about
your brother's child.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.433
That was a tragedy.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.136
How long you been planning
to kick my dad off the throne?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.374
Since the day he banished me.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.344
Look, I've got
big plans for us.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.347
But you need to get rid of your
little Mexican girlfriend first.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.815
Babe, it's not that easy.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.484
I told you, I think
I'm in love with her.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.720
What would you say
if I made you CEO of Empire?

13:40.753 --> 13:44.124
Would you still be
in love with her then?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.526
You can make
that happen?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.395
I think so.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.798
The board wants Jago
Locke to take over,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.167
but if we can swing enough
votes, we can push you through.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.402
I know a vote you can get.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.404
Ma, what are you doing here?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.639
I'm here to make you
the deal of a lifetime, son.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.708
(chuckles)

14:01.741 --> 14:04.244
I'm gonna let you
acquire my company.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.846
And what's
in it for me?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.015
Hakeem Lyon,

14:08.048 --> 14:10.550
who as partner
of Lyon Dynasty

14:10.583 --> 14:11.985
is still under contract with us.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.453
He still belongs to me.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.224
How much?
20 million.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.159
(chuckles)
Never.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.028
Well, then you can't
have Hakeem, bitch.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.495
I already did.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.598
And I have no
problem suing you.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.235
I will crush you with
Empire legal bills.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.436
(chuckles)

14:29.469 --> 14:32.739
Hakeem, do you really
want to be CEO?

14:32.772 --> 14:35.275
Because I can make that
happen for you, baby,

14:35.308 --> 14:37.244
but I got to be here.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
See that scallywag next to you?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.181
She ain't got what it takes
to push out Jago out,

14:41.214 --> 14:42.950
but I can do it,
and you know it.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.419
This company is not gonna be
run like gangsters anymore.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.888
The answer is
no, Cookie.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.431
You really gonna pick this bitch
over your own family, Hakeem?

14:58.465 --> 15:00.800
At least she don't
beat me with a purse.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.671
Not unless you
want me to.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.478
(sniffs)

15:19.186 --> 15:21.254
(candy clattering)

15:21.288 --> 15:23.356
This is so childish.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.795
*

15:35.502 --> 15:37.337
Okay.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.139
Jago Locke.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.840
He's the leading
CEO contender,

15:40.873 --> 15:43.010
but after Guy has
a little talk with him,

15:43.043 --> 15:44.844
we expect him
to drop out.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.413
Or leave the country.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.415
LUCIOUS: I need you all
to systematically

15:48.448 --> 15:53.120
pay a visit to each and every
one of these board members.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.023
Listen, just so we're all
on the same page, and I'm clear,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.657
how hard do you want this talk?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.127
THIRSTY: Well, seeing as
you and whomever else

16:00.160 --> 16:01.828
just got released from prison,

16:01.861 --> 16:03.763
I'd say nothing illegal
like murder,

16:03.796 --> 16:05.432
but everything else
is fair game.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.268
Basically, truth is,
we're at war.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.703
The empire is at stake,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.605
and you can't be afraid to do

16:12.639 --> 16:16.009
whatever you got to do
to secure the empire.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.777
Whatever's necessary
to bring back a victory.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.413
Lucious,
who's gonna handle Hakeem?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.423
I'll take care of Fredo.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.795
Okay, let's get to it.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.565
Okay, here are the rest
of the board members.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.034
Just pass 'em down.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.672
(knocking)

16:45.705 --> 16:46.739
Come in.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.808
Knock, knock.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.343
Hey.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.744
Hey.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.180
How you doing?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.514
Oh, great.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.150
I, uh, brought you these.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.185
Oh, thank you.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.486
You're welcome.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.354
I'll just put 'em over here.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.095
So... what happened?

17:08.128 --> 17:10.230
I really don't
know. I mean,

17:10.263 --> 17:12.665
I remember that that stupid
alarm kept going off, and I...

17:12.699 --> 17:16.069
and I got up to try and turn it
off, and then, I don't know.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.771
The next thing I know,
I'm at the bottom of the stairs.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.007
(sighs)

17:21.040 --> 17:22.809
Oh, honey.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.246
When I heard the news,

17:26.279 --> 17:29.282
I just kept thinking, it's...

17:29.316 --> 17:33.353
so bizarre and extremely cliché,

17:33.386 --> 17:39.159
but... maybe everything
happens for a reason.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.131
I was so looking forward
to meeting him.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.166
Oh.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.236
Here, honey.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.703
(sobs softly)
Thanks.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.306
And I just feel so

17:53.340 --> 17:56.576
incredibly guilty.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.179
(sniffles)
Like I let Andre down.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.117
You know, all that heir
to the empire stuff.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.052
Yeah.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.954
And now there is none.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.823
No, no, no, no.
Honey, there'll be another heir.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.725
You really think so?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.794
I do.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.430
I really do.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.834
JAMAL:
Hakeem.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.737
Come on, man. It's not even
noon, you're already drinking?

18:24.771 --> 18:25.838
Slow down on that.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.640
You want one?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.409
No.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.244
What's wrong?

18:31.278 --> 18:34.614
Would you be mad
if I ran for CEO?

18:34.647 --> 18:38.251
First you vote Dad out, now
you want to take his job?

18:38.285 --> 18:40.287
That's a little messy,
don't you think?

18:40.320 --> 18:43.089
After all the wrong he's done
to me throughout my life,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.724
he deserves worse.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.165
Truth be told...

18:52.199 --> 18:54.367
I hated running Empire.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.369
You know, it takes
away from your music,

18:56.403 --> 19:00.207
it turned me into someone
I ain't even know.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.841
It's everything I want.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.611
And Dad will kill
your ass if you do it.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.979
Man, I got bigger problems
than Dad right now.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.115
Camilla told me
I got to ditch Laura.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.518
Okay, all the girls you go
through, why is that a problem?

19:11.551 --> 19:14.854
I just never felt this way
about a girl before.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.525
She's special.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.261
I hear you.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.232
I guess we can't
have it all, huh?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.267
Guess not.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.503
Then again,

19:30.537 --> 19:33.473
if you're willing
to give up Empire for a girl,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.908
how much did you really
want it to begin with?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.546
Keem.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.183
* You can try
and take away my crown *

19:44.217 --> 19:47.086
* But I will never
let my kingdom down *

19:47.119 --> 19:50.923
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

19:50.957 --> 19:53.926
* Damn, I wear it so well

19:53.960 --> 19:56.162
* I know that they're comin'
for my throne *

19:56.195 --> 20:00.066
* But I'm the one
who got here on my own *

20:00.099 --> 20:03.503
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

20:03.536 --> 20:05.705
* Damn, I wear it so well

20:05.738 --> 20:09.542
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh...

20:09.576 --> 20:12.345
Cut! Cut the damn music
right now!

20:12.379 --> 20:13.846
(music stops)

20:13.880 --> 20:15.415
Are you okay?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.049
Why you being lazy?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.785
There's millions of people
who watch Tiny Desk,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.587
and you're a step
behind the other girls,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.121
and you're supposed
to be the lead.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.890
You're holding
'em back, Laura.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.057
No, I'm not.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.225
You are a little bit.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.961
Why are you acting like this?

20:28.995 --> 20:31.230
'Cause you don't
work hard enough.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.032
I don't work hard?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.535
I'm not the one barging in here,
drunk, acting like an ass.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.969
Who you calling an ass, bitch?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.037
You, bitch!

20:38.070 --> 20:39.439
Okay, you know what?

20:39.472 --> 20:42.108
I can't take this second-rate
telenovela anymore.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.543
Honestly, I'm sick
of this, too.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.977
You both suck.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.946
I need to get y'all
some vocal coaches?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.315
Screw you, Hakeem.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.049
I don't know
what your problem is,

20:50.082 --> 20:51.618
but I'm not gonna let you
treat me like this.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.153
Oh, so you gonna leave, too?

20:54.186 --> 20:56.756
I knew your little virgin ass
was gonna dip anyway.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.992
Oh, my God.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.429
I was so stupid.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.671
Hey, hey.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.174
So what's up?

21:15.207 --> 21:18.978
I thought you were gonna push
to help our cause.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.449
Of course. However I can.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.618
I'm not really sure
if we want you to.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.186
How's Skye?

21:27.219 --> 21:29.456
Heard about that.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.491
How?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.159
Does it really matter?

21:33.192 --> 21:36.095
If the press gets it,
you're gonna give fuel

21:36.128 --> 21:39.966
to every politician that says
being gay is a choice.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.968
They're gonna look
at Jamal Lyon and say,

21:42.001 --> 21:43.536
"Hey, the gay icon can choose

21:43.570 --> 21:45.538
to sleep with women
whenever he wants."

21:45.572 --> 21:47.707
Yeah, well, I'm
still gay, so...

21:47.740 --> 21:49.476
Yeah, well, then what are you
screwing Skye for?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.378
I'm not.
I'm literally not.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.279
But I-I'm sorry,
I don't even know

21:53.312 --> 21:54.647
what we're talking
about here.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.015
Whose business is that?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.484
There are ten countries
in the world

21:57.517 --> 21:59.386
where being gay
will get you executed.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.687
Nigeria, Sudan,

22:00.720 --> 22:03.189
Mauritania, Somalia, Yemen,

22:03.222 --> 22:06.626
Pakistan, Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.661
But good luck with the music.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.232
(haunting piano melody playing)

22:23.510 --> 22:26.846
*

22:43.229 --> 22:45.231
*

22:56.976 --> 23:00.246
*

23:06.218 --> 23:08.220
*

23:11.257 --> 23:13.626
(piano playing stops)

23:20.099 --> 23:21.934
All that I know is that

23:21.968 --> 23:24.303
I couldn't stand running Empire,
but Hakeem and Camilla?

23:24.336 --> 23:26.038
They gonna burn that place
down to the ground.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.707
That's the one
I'm worried about.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.142
Why?
Because music
ain't in her soul.

23:30.176 --> 23:33.212
And that's exactly why you can't
lay up on these ASAs, Jamal.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.047
Ma, don't nobody care
about no award, come on.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.583
Boy, we are Lyons.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.884
Music first.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.586
Do you realize
if you win

23:39.619 --> 23:42.722
an ASA against your father
in the same category,

23:42.755 --> 23:44.724
you're on your way
to being legendary.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.659
Don't you want
that, stupid?

23:46.693 --> 23:48.294
Yes.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.062
But it's not
happening right now.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.598
Jamieson found out
about Skye,

23:51.631 --> 23:53.399
and he's pulling back
his support.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.602
Yeah, see, that's another
one I don't get, Jamal.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.837
You messing around with
girls? Pick a damn team.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.006
I'm picking nothing.
Do what I want to do,

24:00.039 --> 24:02.074
and ain't nobody's business
who I get down with.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.643
So what does
this mean, huh?

24:03.676 --> 24:07.313
You one of them wishy-washy,
confused bisexuals now?

24:07.346 --> 24:10.182
(laughs) Whatever. No.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.951
Sexuality is fluid.
Shut up.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.285
Mom, it is, I'm sorry.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.687
It is.
You know what I'm saying?

24:14.721 --> 24:17.023
You-you have straight
and-and gay and bi

24:17.056 --> 24:19.258
and a lot a bit of everything.
I don't know.
Yeah, it sound like

24:19.291 --> 24:21.093
y'all just want to be
freaky-deaky.
A little freaky-deaky.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.829
(laughs)
You ain't never
slept with no woman?

24:22.862 --> 24:24.831
Boy, nobody having
that conversation with you.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.933
Oh, really?
Look, all I'm saying

24:26.966 --> 24:28.601
is that sometimes
things happen, you know?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.136
You feel a certain way
and you...

24:30.169 --> 24:32.505
you act on it
or you don't.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.307
Just because I have sex with,
uh, two women in my entire life

24:35.341 --> 24:38.711
doesn't mean, you know,
I'm straight or bi or anything.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.013
I'm still a gay brother

24:41.047 --> 24:43.149
looking for a man.
(laughs)

24:43.182 --> 24:45.351
Yeah, me, too.
All night long.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.020
Okay, all right, see, you got
to take it too far. I'm out.
I like...

24:48.054 --> 24:50.056
Shut up, boy. How you think
your big-head ass got here?

24:50.089 --> 24:51.190
Immaculate conception.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.893
Look, Jamal,
listen to me.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.663
You cannot piss people
like Jamieson off

24:56.696 --> 24:58.998
if you want to win
an ASA award, okay?

24:59.031 --> 25:02.234
Awards are like
politics, baby.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.970
Think of this like a campaign.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.238
You're running for
office, all right?

25:06.272 --> 25:09.709
So I need you to get your head
back in the game and get

25:09.742 --> 25:12.211
your gay back and
get that ASA award!

25:12.244 --> 25:14.647
You need to
become legendary!

25:14.681 --> 25:16.849
*

25:23.556 --> 25:26.358
It has come
to my attention

25:26.392 --> 25:29.562
that all of the CEO candidates
have withdrawn their nominations

25:29.596 --> 25:31.430
due to personal reasons.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.900
JAGO: (chuckles)
No, it's more than personal.

25:33.933 --> 25:37.003
You know what,
this sinking ship is going down

25:37.036 --> 25:39.606
with or without
Lucious Lyon,

25:39.639 --> 25:42.942
But if any of you
Lucious Lyon thugs are here,

25:42.975 --> 25:45.712
you tell him and his company...

25:45.745 --> 25:47.379
go to hell.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.183
Very well, then.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.586
Since all the candidates
have withdrawn,

25:53.620 --> 25:56.188
we will now open up
to any other board member

25:56.222 --> 25:58.290
for nominations.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.393
So who would like
to run for CEO of Empire?

26:01.427 --> 26:03.362
Me.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.065
I ain't scared
of no bitch-ass Lucious Lyon.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.366
You shouldn't either.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.135
Empire--

26:09.168 --> 26:10.536
that's my birthright.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.471
I'm the youngest son.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.041
I got the swag, the talent,

26:15.074 --> 26:18.544
the looks-- you know it--
to be the future head

26:18.577 --> 26:19.879
of this company.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.414
But I'm-a take Empire
to the future,

26:22.448 --> 26:23.883
unlike Lucious Lyon
talking about

26:23.916 --> 26:26.285
his devil-ass past
and snitch bitching.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.656
From here on out,
this is about to be the biggest

26:29.689 --> 26:31.891
and baddest company
in hip-hop culture.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.727
Ladies and gentleman,

26:34.761 --> 26:39.632
make some noise for the new era
of Hakeem Lyon, y'all.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.307
JAMAL:
Hey, everyone.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.910
So, look, I know that
this is an ASA event,

26:50.943 --> 26:53.445
so we're supposed to sing a song
that, uh, is nominated.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.514
But I'd to trump tradition
for a moment

26:55.547 --> 26:58.184
and, um, sing a song
that I just wrote.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.521
*

27:02.554 --> 27:06.292
* It's a new generation,
welcome to modern love, yeah *

27:06.325 --> 27:08.460
* It's a revolution,
do what we want *

27:08.494 --> 27:10.763
* 'Cause we must, yeah

27:10.797 --> 27:12.164
* I got a brand-new
perspective *

27:12.198 --> 27:15.201
* And I don't really
give a damn who knows *

27:15.234 --> 27:17.704
* So put your hands
all in my pockets *

27:17.737 --> 27:19.438
* 'Cause I wanna feel you
up under my clothes *

27:19.471 --> 27:23.342
* 'Cause I wanna love

27:23.375 --> 27:25.778
* Somebody, everybody

27:25.812 --> 27:28.214
* Can't nobody tell me
how to love *

27:28.247 --> 27:32.651
* 'Cause I wanna touch, ooh

27:32.685 --> 27:34.653
* Somebody, gimme body

27:34.687 --> 27:37.389
* Everybody calls it love
or lust, I call it *

27:37.423 --> 27:39.391
* Freedom, freedom

27:39.425 --> 27:41.127
* Grab someone you want

27:41.160 --> 27:43.562
* Singin' freedom, freedom

27:43.595 --> 27:45.898
* Dancin' in the dark

27:45.932 --> 27:47.867
* Freedom, freedom

27:47.900 --> 27:49.501
* Tell me can you
feel the rush? *

27:49.535 --> 27:52.705
* It's called freedom, freedom

27:52.739 --> 27:54.807
* Freedom, freedom

27:54.841 --> 27:57.043
* Whoa, oh, oh

27:57.076 --> 27:59.145
* Come and get you some

27:59.178 --> 28:01.480
* Whoa, oh, oh

28:01.513 --> 28:03.515
* Pick it up, pick it up.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.451
(crowd cheering)

28:17.196 --> 28:18.697
Here you go, babe.
Thank you, Mom.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.399
Thanks, Mom.
Mm.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.371
So, um...

28:25.404 --> 28:27.740
is Rhonda happy
to be going home today?

28:27.774 --> 28:30.409
Yeah. But, um...

28:30.442 --> 28:34.080
she's, uh, she's scared we won't
be able to have kids again.

28:37.149 --> 28:40.386
Yeah, well...

28:40.419 --> 28:43.589
you tell Rhonda that, um...

28:43.622 --> 28:45.357
I had a miscarriage, too.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.093
Mm-hmm.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.560
Before the three of y'all.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.029
You did?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.931
Yeah.

28:51.964 --> 28:55.634
Me and Lucious were devastated.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.469
We pretended it didn't happen.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.807
It was a little girl, too.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.043
I thought it was
the end of the world.

29:04.076 --> 29:07.546
But then God blessed me
with three

29:07.579 --> 29:10.316
of the most beautiful boys
I ever seen in my life.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.084
Even Hakeem?

29:12.118 --> 29:15.087
Yeah, I still can't believe
he pulled it off.

29:15.121 --> 29:19.491
I hear you're trying to get
Empire to buy Lyon Dynasty.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.960
You really want
to work under Camilla?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.829
No, I want to take
that bitch out,

29:22.862 --> 29:25.664
but I can't do it
unless I'm on the inside.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.935
Think I have a way
to make that happen.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.736
Make what happen?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.204
Empire buying Lyon Dynasty.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.274
You just got to promise me
one thing.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.175
What?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.810
You gonna take down Camilla.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.146
Hmm.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.181
Don't you worry about that.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.753
Home, sweet home.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.688
I'm such an idiot.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.323
No, you're not, baby.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.825
You're just clumsy.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.927
That's not funny.
Really, really clumsy.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.595
Well, you just
dropped me on the couch.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.464
I'm sorry.
(laughs)

29:58.497 --> 30:00.132
Want to put
your feet up?

30:00.166 --> 30:03.836
Uh... no, I'm okay.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.537
Listen, don't beat
yourself up, okay?

30:05.571 --> 30:08.507
We are gonna get
through this together.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.376
I promise you that.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.278
Okay.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.812
I love you.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.484
I love you, too.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.152
Want me to carry you upstairs?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.655
(sighs) No.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.992
I-I don't want to go up there.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.394
I don't want to sleep up there
tonight or tomorrow.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.828
Or ever.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.297
Okay, we'll sleep
downstairs, then.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.232
Okay.
You want something to drink?

30:33.265 --> 30:35.401
Vodka, please?

30:35.434 --> 30:36.668
How about a water?

30:36.702 --> 30:38.037
With vodka.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.738
Uh, water it is.
(chuckles)

30:41.240 --> 30:42.741
Be right back.
Okay.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.619
(sniffles)

31:10.937 --> 31:12.571
(groans)

31:12.604 --> 31:14.740
Okay.

31:14.773 --> 31:17.776
Okay, you can do this, Rhonda.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.316
(groaning softly)

31:30.389 --> 31:31.623
(grunts)

31:33.225 --> 31:35.194
(panting)

31:35.227 --> 31:37.229
(sighs) Oh, man.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.268
(sighs)

31:49.241 --> 31:52.311
*

31:55.614 --> 31:56.815
It's not gonna kill you.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.317
Worked real hard for it.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.718
Would you look at this?

31:59.751 --> 32:02.588
If this isn't the saddest sight
I've ever seen.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.557
Oh, and I'm not just talking
about your face, Yoko.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.059
Hello, Cookie.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.927
It is never a pleasure
to see you.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.065
Congratulations,
little brother.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.067
Finally got your
throne, huh?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.468
Mm-hmm.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.170
Just be careful
up there.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.671
Brings out the darkness in you.

32:19.705 --> 32:20.506
Like you?

32:20.539 --> 32:22.241
Mm-hmm.
I ain't scared.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.742
But you should be.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.677
Of what I'm-a do
to your next album.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.113
You do know

32:27.146 --> 32:28.780
I can release it
whenever I want, right?

32:28.814 --> 32:30.316
COOKIE:
And that's exactly

32:30.349 --> 32:32.418
what we came here to
talk to you about, babe.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.819
Yeah?
Yeah.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.421
JAMAL: You see,
my Black and Whit album

32:35.454 --> 32:37.256
was a joint venture between
Empire and Lyon Dynasty,

32:37.289 --> 32:39.691
so I figure why not just
let Dynasty release it?

32:39.725 --> 32:42.361
You can't do that.
We own that album. Right, babe?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.663
Yeah.
Actually, they can,
baby brother.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.865
You see, there were never
any stipulations

32:46.898 --> 32:48.500
as to which label
would release it.

32:48.534 --> 32:51.170
Try it and I'll have you
tied up in court for years.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.805
Try it and we'll leak it online.
(chuckles)

32:53.839 --> 32:57.443
See, I learned a few things
from little King Hakeem, too.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.279
COOKIE: See, Hakeem,
we know this puts you in a jam.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.181
This could be terrible press
for you.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.983
Your first act as CEO,
the first thing you do

33:05.017 --> 33:06.152
is lose
your biggest artist?

33:06.185 --> 33:07.386
ANDRE:
Stock price will take a dive,

33:07.419 --> 33:09.188
but it should recover
in a year or two.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.657
Why are you doing this?

33:11.690 --> 33:13.292
You bring Lyon
Dynasty here, Ma.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.960
That would be a disaster.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.696
As much as I hate to agree
with her, Yo-ho is right.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.532
It would never work,
us together in the same company.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.502
Not unless I had full autonomy.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.137
And that's ridiculous.
ANDRE: Actually, it's not.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.739
Roc-A-Fella had the same deal
with Def Jam.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.308
Straight-up marketing
and distribution

33:29.341 --> 33:31.377
with no interference.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.080
Cookie has her own company under
Empire with no questions asked.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.583
Okay, I'm cool with that.
COOKIE: Okay.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.219
Well, then I want to be head
of A&R for all of Empire.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.687
ANDRE:
What are you doing?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.222
COOKIE: I'm negotiating.
I always wanted this.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.756
And I'd be damn good at it, too.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.158
I got the best ear
in the business.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.426
You all know it's true.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.861
Hakeem, don't do this.
Don't do it.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.897
You're gonna lose the company.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.599
They're gonna come in
and they're gonna dethrone you

33:53.632 --> 33:54.700
on the very first day.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.202
Everything you
worked for

33:56.235 --> 33:59.271
is gonna be gone,
just like that.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.740
Biggest mistake
you could make.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.176
Maybe.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.113
But I took my dad out
because he lost his way.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.047
But I did it
for all of us.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.683
So let's just come back
to Empire

34:11.717 --> 34:15.421
and let's be a real family
again, like we was before.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.292
Ma, you got yourself a deal.

34:31.737 --> 34:36.208
Well, you can use this place
for as long as you like.

34:36.242 --> 34:40.246
I know it's not Empire,
but it's got soul.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.414
Yeah, I kind of like
this vibe.

34:42.448 --> 34:45.050
Look, I need you to just
focus on music right now.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.385
Let me deal
with Camilla.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.654
No, I can help with her.
No.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.989
You sit your ass down
somewhere and write a song,

34:51.022 --> 34:53.392
and you leave the
dirty work to Cookie.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.162
Yes, ma'am. You the boss.
Yes.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.197
Mm. And don't you
ever forget that.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.133
(chuckles)

35:01.167 --> 35:02.934
You like it, don't you?
(laughs)

35:07.839 --> 35:09.841
(birds chirping)

35:23.489 --> 35:25.491
(exhales)

35:47.513 --> 35:49.515
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.158
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.567
(crying softly)

36:14.072 --> 36:17.476
God, help me.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.479
Please! (sobbing)

36:20.512 --> 36:23.515
* You can try
and take away my crown *

36:23.549 --> 36:26.685
* But I will never let
my kingdom down *

36:26.718 --> 36:30.489
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

36:30.522 --> 36:33.425
* Damn, I wear it so well

36:33.459 --> 36:36.562
* I know that they comin'
for my throne *

36:36.595 --> 36:39.565
* But I'm the one
who got here on my own *

36:39.598 --> 36:43.201
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

36:43.235 --> 36:45.237
* Damn, I wear it so well

36:45.271 --> 36:49.675
* I can still feel your eyes

36:49.708 --> 36:52.177
* On me like a spotlight

36:52.210 --> 36:56.081
* You held me up, up so high

36:56.114 --> 36:58.550
* So tell me, was it all lies?

36:58.584 --> 37:02.087
* Everything that I've done

37:02.120 --> 37:05.357
* Has got me
where I want to be *

37:05.391 --> 37:08.360
* So, baby,
why'd you have to leave? *

37:08.394 --> 37:11.363
* Whoa, oh...

37:11.397 --> 37:14.366
* When you got the world
in your hands *

37:14.400 --> 37:17.303
* Seems like everyone wants you
to fail *

37:17.336 --> 37:20.406
* It's like I've got a target
on my back *

37:20.439 --> 37:23.709
* Take a shot at me,
take a shot for me *

37:23.742 --> 37:26.712
* You can try
and take away my crown *

37:26.745 --> 37:30.081
* But I will never let
my kingdom down *

37:30.115 --> 37:33.619
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

37:33.652 --> 37:35.721
* Damn, I wear it so well

37:35.754 --> 37:39.090
* I know that they comin'
for my throne *

37:39.124 --> 37:40.959
* But I'm the one
who got here... *

37:40.992 --> 37:42.428
What are you
doing here?

37:42.461 --> 37:44.396
I knocked,
and nobody was home.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.832
Everyone's at my grandma's
house. What do you want?

37:46.865 --> 37:49.335
Babe, I'm really sorry
on what I did.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.503
I know I was being an ass.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.339
I know.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.507
But you got to understand,
I broke up with you

37:55.541 --> 37:57.242
to get my empire back.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.011
But now that I got what's mine,
all I want is you.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.614
I don't understand.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.317
* Everyone wants a piece

38:05.351 --> 38:07.653
* Just so they can judge me

38:07.686 --> 38:11.289
* I thought I had your heart,
but you let me down *

38:11.323 --> 38:13.425
* And left me standing
all alone... *

38:13.459 --> 38:16.261
You sure you
want to do this?

38:16.294 --> 38:19.765
You promise me
we'll really be together?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.700
I promise.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.769
* When you got the world
in your hands *

38:23.802 --> 38:26.772
* Seems like everyone wants you
to fail *

38:26.805 --> 38:30.041
* It's like I've got a target
on my back *

38:30.075 --> 38:32.811
* Take a shot at me,
take a shot for me *

38:32.844 --> 38:36.448
* You can try
and take away my crown *

38:36.482 --> 38:39.785
* But I will never let
my kingdom down *

38:39.818 --> 38:42.988
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

38:43.021 --> 38:44.990
* Damn, I wear it so well

38:45.023 --> 38:47.325
* I know that they comin'
for my throne... *

38:47.359 --> 38:48.960
I don't think
we should do this.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.796
Yes, Hakeem. Please.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.364
* On my own

38:52.398 --> 38:55.834
* When I put it on,
it's on for real *

38:55.867 --> 38:58.470
* Damn, I wear it so well

38:58.504 --> 39:01.407
* Oh, whoa...

39:01.440 --> 39:02.574
* Oh...

39:02.608 --> 39:04.843
Don't stop.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.513
* Oh, whoa...

39:07.546 --> 39:10.248
I love you.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.184
I love you, too.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.888
* Oh, whoa

39:16.922 --> 39:20.892
* Oh, whoa...

39:20.926 --> 39:24.062
* Damn, I wear it so well.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.097
(whistling tune)

39:36.307 --> 39:38.309
What's up?

39:40.145 --> 39:42.047
Come on over here.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.382
(train horn blowing
in distance)

39:51.156 --> 39:52.724
You have any idea

39:52.758 --> 39:54.793
where you're standing?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.995
Where?

39:58.997 --> 40:03.334
That's the spot where my
very best friend lost his life.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.973
He actually introduced me
to your mama.

40:08.006 --> 40:11.543
He damn near raised y'all
when I was on the road.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.880
He risked his life for me
on more than one occasion,

40:14.913 --> 40:17.583
and I risked mine for him.

40:17.616 --> 40:20.285
Except one night.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.454
And I shot him in the face.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.926
You know who I'm talking about.
It was your Uncle Bunkie.

40:30.762 --> 40:35.834
You see, that's how much
the empire means to me.

40:35.867 --> 40:39.237
And if you think you're gonna be
the CEO of my company,

40:39.270 --> 40:44.209
I will stop at nothing
to take it back.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.314
Since you're my baby boy,

40:49.347 --> 40:52.884
I got something for you.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.623
Take it.
Don't be scared.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.927
See, now's the time
for you to decide

41:01.960 --> 41:07.298
how far you're willing to go
to have the empire.

41:07.332 --> 41:10.802
You want to be king...

41:10.836 --> 41:13.505
kill your father
and sit on his throne.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.641
It's life or death.

41:15.674 --> 41:19.511
So if you don't shoot me
right here, I promise you,

41:19.545 --> 41:20.979
the next time I see you,

41:21.012 --> 41:24.315
I will do my best
to take your life.

41:24.349 --> 41:27.352
So shoot me,
so I don't have to do it to you.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.962
There you go.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.365
I know it's hard.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.834
But do it.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.402
It's okay.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.273
I'll make it easy
for you.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.678
You like stabbing people
in the back.

41:52.711 --> 41:55.881
Shoot me in the back.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.917
Oh, that's my boy.
I knew you could do it.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.919
Now pull the damn trigger.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.387
This what you want?

42:02.420 --> 42:04.222
Pull the damn trigger.

42:04.255 --> 42:06.257
(train clacking)

42:17.035 --> 42:19.905
I ain't got to do
what you want.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.139
(gun clatters on ground)

42:23.241 --> 42:25.343
Watch your back,

42:25.376 --> 42:27.779
baby boy!

42:27.813 --> 42:29.781
I keep my promises!

43:09.621 --> 43:10.722
Yeah.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.659
