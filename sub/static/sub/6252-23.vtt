It’s my birthday, and I wanna bowl!

00:07.258 --> 00:09.749
I know, sweetheart.
But we have to take turns.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.551
No turns! It’s my birthday!

Okay. Okay.

Can we let Justin bowl,
just once?

00:17.393 --> 00:20.760
- I wanna bowl now!
- [Woman ] Excuse me!

00:20.855 --> 00:24.598
Lane four! The pins aren’t
resetting on lane four.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.184
Okay. Well, look, I gotta reset the lane,
so you tell him to cool his jets.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.357
It’s my birthday,
and I wanna bowl!
Yeah. That’ll work.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.861
- Now!
- You need to behave, Justin!

00:33.951 --> 00:36.613
I don’t have to!
I’m the birthday boy!

00:36.704 --> 00:40.196
You know what happens to
little boys at a bowling alley
who don’t behave,

00:40.291 --> 00:41.952
even on their birthday?

00:42.043 --> 00:44.910
- What?
- I don’t think you wanna know. Behave!

00:45.004 --> 00:48.087

You look beautiful.

for a water buffalo.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.860
It’s two days
past my due date.

01:19.956 --> 01:22.447
Well, the doctor
said the baby could be
up to two weeks late.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.746
It’s time to take matters
into my own hands.
What do you mean?

01:25.836 --> 01:29.203
Excuse me.
Could I have some
habanero sauce, please?

01:29.298 --> 01:31.505
Hot sauce
can bring on labor.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.253
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.426
You confirmed
with Dr. Banno?

01:35.554 --> 01:39.092
First thing, she has to
check the baby’s eyes.
She knows.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.549
I mean, l’m— I’m sure we
can handle it either way,

01:41.644 --> 01:43.851
but I— I’d just like to know
as soon as possible.

01:43.938 --> 01:48.181
Dr. Banno has everything
under control, and everyone
says she’s the best.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.938
I’m sure I’ve asked you all this,
like, a hundred times, right?

01:51.028 --> 01:53.189
It’s okay. I don’t care.

01:55.199 --> 01:58.612
Don’t you think that
that might be a little
too much there, babe?

01:58.703 --> 02:00.864
Ah, no.
This isn’t that hot.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.452

I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

02:09.547 --> 02:13.085

Can I get some milk

02:24.145 --> 02:26.511
Angela says she’s going
to have her baby today.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.596
She’s been saying that
every day for two weeks.

02:28.691 --> 02:32.309
Well, mathematically speaking,
the chances of her being right
increase every day.

02:32.403 --> 02:36.692
Wow! Can you say,
“blech of a strike”?

02:36.782 --> 02:40.616
Okay. There’s an extreme amount
of insect and maggot activity.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.318
That would explain
the lack of tissue.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.779
No one noticed him
before he dropped?

02:44.874 --> 02:48.241
The owner says the alley’s
been closed for 10 days
to resurface the floors.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.748
Just reopened today.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.875
Judging by this piece of the pelvis,
and the mandible,

02:53.966 --> 02:56.673
I would say he was
a Caucasian male, mid-30s.

02:56.761 --> 02:59.594
How’d he get into the pinsetter?

03:01.182 --> 03:04.925
Well, look at that.
Looks like he got caught up
in the machine, Bones.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.351
Well, it ground him up
quite effectively.

03:07.438 --> 03:11.181
The owner said people have
been known to sneak back here
for, uh, you know—

03:11.275 --> 03:14.312
- I do not know.
- To have, you know—

03:14.403 --> 03:17.110
What? Snacks?
There are a lot of
fast-food wrappers.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.985
That would account
for the maggots, insects
and the rapid decomp.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.941
No. Wrong kind of snack.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.779
- Bones, the, you know, sexual liaisons.
- Oh! [Chuckling]

03:25.873 --> 03:28.956
So, what do you think, huh?
He fell in there after making
a little whoopee?

03:29.043 --> 03:33.036
Well, only if he died
during whoopee and then
fell into the machine.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.122
He was dead
when he was ripped apart.
At least a week.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.458
There’s bruising
on the ulna and the pisiform.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.544
And there’s a slight fracture
on the radial tuberosity.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.550
All antemortem.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.723
- Did you follow that?
- Dead first and then ground up.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.347
These are
defensive wounds, Booth.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.302
The victim was
fending off an attack.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.684
- Well, he definitely failed to fend.
- I agree.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.141

why we’re here.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.026

as human beings, or—

04:39.113 --> 04:40.944
Really? I’m about to be
a father any second,

04:41.031 --> 04:42.771

04:42.867 --> 04:45.199
No, I mean, here,

04:45.286 --> 04:48.198
when we should be home,
waiting in comfort.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.951
It’s normal to be worried.
Worry can make a guy edgy.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.169
So, right now, what
you’re being is normal.

04:54.253 --> 04:57.165
Yeah. Says the guy taking apart
a meat-puppet puzzle.

Watch this. I’m about
to Brennanize you.
“Brennanize”?

metacarpal on the right thumb,

05:02.386 --> 05:04.251
chondromalacia patellae
of the left knee,

05:04.346 --> 05:05.802
a notch in the notch
of the ulna.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.308
“A notch in the notch”?
That’s correct.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.633
With exostosis
of the medial surface.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.470
So what is that? Some kind of,
like, repetitive-stress stuff?

- Bowling?
- Bowling, yes.

high level...

05:45.095 --> 05:46.710
of polyester in his garment.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.093
And the fact that he was found
in a bowling alley.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.926
And the fact that he was
wearing a bowling shirt...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.853
with the name “Jeff’
sewn on the pocket.

- I don’t know, honey.

Maybe we should try
a— an amusement park.

06:31.016 --> 06:36.852

just let the hot sauce
work its magic.

where Max killed someone.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.915

not to do that anymore.

he might be able to help us
catch the bad guy.

that labor could be
hastened by silence.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.752
Did Hodgins tell you
to tell me that?

07:40.836 --> 07:45.170
For some reason, I find it
very difficult to concentrate
on anything else.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.670

you are a very good friend.

- Bed.

- Okay. Who’s Rosamund?
- She’s a lady friend.

Did she break a hip
or something?

She’s 36, and, by the way,

weren’t we talking about
a murder case here?

08:43.232 --> 08:46.269
Dad, can you think of why anyone
would want to kill Jeff Fowler?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.521
Well, he liked to call
himself “The Closer.”

08:48.612 --> 08:50.728
And we called him
“The Gloater.”

08:50.823 --> 08:54.065
- You can kill a guy just for that.
- No kidding. You should.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.696
Hey, cut it out. It wasn’t me.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.778
You know, you have
trust issues, my friend.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.456
- Do you think he was
killed by a poor loser?
- Absolutely. Just not me.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.750
All right. We’ll just talk to everyone
who he bowled against.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.294
No,no,no,no,no.
Here’s the thing. It’s a tournament.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.839
You’re not gonna get people
to talk to you if it’s only gonna
lead to more questions.

09:10.926 --> 09:14.214
But the first 48 hours
of a murder investigation are crucial.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.678
Yeah.
Well, you’re a bowler, aren’t you?

09:16.807 --> 09:19.173
Yeah, yeah. I bowl. High 2803.
Whoo!

09:19.268 --> 09:22.385
- What does that mean?
- It means he’s good.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.390
So why not go in undercover?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.437
Come on. You could take my place
with The Thunderballs.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.483
- But you just said they won’t talk.
- Yeah, but they love to gossip.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.733
I mean, what do you think
bowlers are doing when they’re
not actually bowling?

09:32.823 --> 09:35.314
| get it.
Get ’em to say something
during the tournament.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.617
- I’m liking this.
- I love undercover. What’ll I be?

09:38.704 --> 09:42.447
- Uh, you can be my girlfriend.
- Fine.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.156
Um, but if Angela
goes into labor,

09:44.251 --> 09:47.243
we have to pick a fight
so that I can be there
to catch the baby.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.589
I will get you there,
hell or high water.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.880
Yeah.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.921

I don’t know.
Something weird here.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.345

What is it? You havin’ a fight?

09:58.432 --> 10:03.347
No. | just really, really wanna be there
when Angela’s baby is born.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.850
Right! So, how soon before
I can become a Thunderball?

Whoo-hoo!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.861
Gladiators’ amphitheater.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.820
I can discern fried food,
sweat, dirty feet,

10:22.915 --> 10:25.156
cigarette smoke,
chewing gum.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.332
And murder.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.956
Okay, now please,
would you try and act
like a couple?

Here we go.

Hey, Amber.
I want you to meet
Buck and Wanda.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.222
- You’re awfully young.
- How good can he be?

10:50.359 --> 10:53.772
He rents his shoes.
Hey, The Closer
rented shoes.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.150
This team is cursed.
First, Jeff gets killed.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.152
Then you fall out of bed.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.325
Now it’s just me
and all this dead weight.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.120

22:09.913 --> 22:12.074
Hello, Dr. Banno.
I’m Wendell Bray.
We’re solving a murder.

22:12.165 --> 22:15.202
I’m pretty sure
we’re supposed to
be solving a baby.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.831
Um— Okay.
So, Wendell, let me see
the mass spec readings.

22:18.922 --> 22:22.039
[Groans, Grunts]
Oh, We-Wendell, um,

22:22.133 --> 22:27.048
what you— what you need to do is run it
through a program called Spatula.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.722
- Hey! Sherry, how’s it goin’?
- Oh, hey, Cam.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.345
We are solving a murder
when we’re supposed to be
concentrating...

22:33.436 --> 22:35.017
on bringing a life
into the world.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.517
- [ Groans ]
- Uh, contraction.
Good stiff one, looks like.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.065
Hey, that’s—
that’s polyurethane.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.315
- Did you say polyurethane?
- Yeah, bowling balls are made
of polyurethane.

22:46.324 --> 22:49.031
- I’ll run it through the Scapula.
- It’s Spatula.

22:49.118 --> 22:53.452
- Okay. Sorry, Ange.
- Bye, and good luck, Angela.
And you too, Sherry.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.958
- [ Max] Oh-ho!
- Yes! Eat it!

23:03.091 --> 23:06.834
Rude.
A little sportsmanship,
if you please.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.967
Sportsmanship is
for losers and wannabes.
I’ll be in the arcade.

23:11.057 --> 23:15.721
Kid was raised by wolves
till she killed and ate them all.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.643
I’ll get your ball
for you, muffin.
Oh!

23:17.730 --> 23:20.688
Her daddy must’ve been a baker,
’cause that is a great set of buns.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.686
- Down, boy.
- Aw, that’s okay.

23:22.777 --> 23:25.769
You got your eye on her too.
I get it. But all’s fair, old man.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.479
I gotta warn you,
I’m in the prime
of my sexual magnetism.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.365
- Go, Buck!
- Go, Buck!

23:31.452 --> 23:33.829
[ Brennan ]
Come on, Buck!

23:33.955 --> 23:37.368
[ Man ]
Showtime!
Ooh. Oh!

23:37.458 --> 23:39.915
- [ Laughing]
- Ah.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.836
- Why are you bowling so badly?
- My feet are killing me.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.504
[ Rings ]
This is Wanda.
Talk to me.

23:45.592 --> 23:50.461
Hey, buddy!
I need a pair of shoes that
aren’t gonna rot my feet!

23:51.556 --> 23:53.763
One with the ball.
One with the lane.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.511
One with the pin.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.218
Come on. Let’s go.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.442
- Boom!
- Buck’s on the truck!

24:06.529 --> 24:09.271
Drivin’ the truck.
Buck truck!

24:11.326 --> 24:13.783
He’s a car thief.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.360
What?
Blake.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.537
lsn’t that the best thing
about bowling—

24:17.624 --> 24:21.458
getting to meet
a wide range of people?

24:21.544 --> 24:24.081
- Kid’s a car thief?
- A compulsive joyrider.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.460
Well, the guy who got killed—
didn’t he restore cars?

24:27.550 --> 24:30.917
Oh, that would make them
natural enemies, I guess.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.752
I never thought of that.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.427
Maybe Blake killed Jeff.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.096
Hey, Alison, you’re up.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.603
Later.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.941
Wendell identified
the murder weapon.
Well, great. It’s about time.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.690
What is it?
A bowling ball.

24:49.781 --> 24:53.490
- Oh, gee. That’s a big help.
- [ Booth ] Great. That’s really
gonna help in here.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.487
Oh, I got a great idea.
I’ll tell you what.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.160
Why don’t you use
your murder ray there
and look in Blake’s bag.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.989
It’s not a murder ray.
It’s an ultraviolet light. Why?

25:01.084 --> 25:03.496
Why? Because they’re
natural enemies.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.911
[Whispering ]
Distract—
[ Murmurs ]

25:08.466 --> 25:10.206
[ Tina ]
Hey! What do you think
you’re doing?

25:10.301 --> 25:14.089
Are you tampering with
his equipment? ’Cause that is
a grievous league violation!

25:14.180 --> 25:15.636
No,no,no.
She’s just lookin’.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.839
Hey, what’s up
with the black light?

25:17.975 --> 25:22.514
I’m just looking to see
if you used any substance
to change the surface of your ball.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.561
Right, like, uh, baby powder
for your grip.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.356
- I don’t cheat.
- Yeah, but you steal cars.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.651
That would make me a thief
and not a cheater.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.195
You know what we should do
is just call over to The Raven.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.615
- Why? No. Please.
- Well, to become our
unbalanced mediator.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.614
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.538
[ Max] No problem.
I got my eye on
you Thunderballs.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.455
You know why?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.784
’Cause Jeff Fowler got
what he deserved...

25:45.878 --> 25:47.789
and so does anyone else
who cheats!

25:47.880 --> 25:49.666
We don’t cheat!

25:50.758 --> 25:53.625
- I bet he killed Jeff.
- Why’s that?

25:53.720 --> 25:58.009
Well, because Jeff
superglued The Raven’s hand
into his bowling ball...

25:58.099 --> 26:01.717
at a Dialing for Dollars Bowl-A—Thon
a couple of years ago.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.723
Yeah, you can see it
on the intenNebs computer.
It’s very funny.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.100
The Raven
has never competed again.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.682
They say sometimes,
if you walk by the bowling
alley at night,

26:09.777 --> 26:12.769
you can hear him yelling at God
and swearing revenge!

26:14.699 --> 26:18.237
So what I want you to do is I
want you to call Sweets, right,
have The Raven picked up...

26:18.327 --> 26:21.819
so we can have him
checked out for a case
of the killer crazies.

26:24.083 --> 26:28.167
Everything looks great.
[ Moaning ]
No, it is not great!

26:28.254 --> 26:31.667
It is not great!
I want this thing out of me,
and it is staying in.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.623
Would you like to
reconsider an epidural?

26:33.718 --> 26:35.424
Hey, yeah.
Why not, Ange?

26:35.511 --> 26:39.174
Because natural childbirth
is a beautiful, beautiful thing!

26:39.265 --> 26:41.176
Okay.
[ Wendell]
Excuse me, Dr. Banno.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.132
You ’re blocking the, uh—

26:43.227 --> 26:46.594
Hey, according to Dr. Brennan,
“bowling ball” wasn ’t specific enough.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.475
Dude, what do you want us
to do about it?

26:48.566 --> 26:52.650
You have to program
a series of variables
into the Angelatron,

26:52.737 --> 26:54.443
which mimic a spread of—

26:54.530 --> 26:57.021
Oh, God Almighty!
A spread of—

26:57.158 --> 26:59.240
[ Shouting ]
Take me now!
[ Screaming ]

26:59.368 --> 27:02.610
A spread of variables
with Mars, Saturn and Uranus!
[ High-pitched Scream ]

27:02.705 --> 27:05.162
- Oh, babe!
- l’ll figure it out myself.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.364
[ Both Whimpering]

27:10.963 --> 27:13.500
[Man On Video ]
Tod Balacleets, The Raven.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.542
[ Crowd Gasping ]

27:17.637 --> 27:20.970
That effectively
ended your career.

27:21.057 --> 27:24.470
I’m a tournament director now.
People respect me.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.472
Right. But your true desire
was to be a professional bowler,

27:27.563 --> 27:29.519
and you would have
attained that desire...

27:29.607 --> 27:33.099
if Jeff Fowler hadn’t put
superglue in your bowling ball.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.981
- It was just a prank.
- Which ruined your life.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.983
l was a great bowler,

27:38.074 --> 27:41.407
but after what Fowler did,
I never trusted my release again.

27:41.494 --> 27:45.578
Fate can be unkind,
but you can’t fight it.

27:45.665 --> 27:49.249
But... you can take revenge...

27:49.335 --> 27:51.826
on the deliverer
of that fate.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.037
The guy who stole
your— your life.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.498
Now, you keep saying
that he ruined my life,

27:57.593 --> 27:59.925
but I supervise 12 leagues.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.264
l have the respect of my peers.
l have a family.

28:02.390 --> 28:06.474
Well, sort of.
The woman that | see sometimes,
her stepkid seems to like me.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.722
I am a well-respected official.

28:08.813 --> 28:12.681
You know, it could be said
that you dress in black and
take revenge on real bowlers...

28:12.775 --> 28:16.939
by humiliating them
in the guise of officialdom.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.237
Are you being so cruel to me
in the hopes of getting...

28:20.324 --> 28:24.192
some kind of crazy
murderer response?

28:24.287 --> 28:25.868
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.116
That’s extremely coldhearted.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.490
It’s my job.
Well, how did I do?

28:30.585 --> 28:33.452
Quite well, actually,
but we still need you
to provide an alibi...

28:33.546 --> 28:35.332
for your whereabouts on the 14th.

28:35.423 --> 28:38.540
l was bowling over
at the Granville Lanes.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.376
No one knows me there,
so I’m less self-conscious.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.212
So you’re saying there’s
no one to vouch for you?

28:45.474 --> 28:47.931
Well, someone must have
seen me there, right?

28:48.019 --> 28:50.601
I am The Raven.

28:53.149 --> 28:57.358
Okay. We are in Spatula, I think.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.481
This should get us
a variety of bowling balls.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.530
Then we can run
different scenarios
to determine the weight.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.695
Very good. She always
makes this look so difficult.
I know.

29:07.163 --> 29:10.200
Oh!
I’m not sure that was right.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.952
l-l know. I know.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.583
...in the counc/ls
of go vernment—

29:14.712 --> 29:17.670
Okay, I’m pretty sure
he’s not the killer.
[ Sighs ]

29:17.757 --> 29:19.213
- by the m/litary—
- [ Meows ]

29:19.342 --> 29:23.005
What are you doing?
I am not really qualified
to do this.

29:23.137 --> 29:26.254
Oh! Whoa, Mr. Bray.
Uh— Look, maybe I
should just ask Angela.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.883
Ah. l-ls this a good time?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.684
/ don’t wanna rush you,
but, um, you’ve got
less than a minute...

29:32.772 --> 29:34.888
before the next
contraction now, Wendell.

29:34.982 --> 29:38.691
Oh, uh, right. Okay.
Uh, this thing doesn’t work.
It started out all right, but—

29:38.778 --> 29:40.894
A million images
started flying by, and—

29:40.988 --> 29:43.229
Oh, my God.
Did you hit purge?

29:43.324 --> 29:45.189
Hey, hey! Get away
from my equipment!

29:45.284 --> 29:48.572
- Do you want me to—
- No. Walk away, Wendell.
Don’t touch anything!

29:48.704 --> 29:50.160
Go. Walk away.
[ Shouts ]

29:50.289 --> 29:52.826
Okay. We’re going.
[Angela Screams ]

29:52.917 --> 29:55.454
Let’s try breathing, okay?
Four short breaths.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.956
Heeh,heeh,hah,hah.
Heeh,heeh,hah,hah.

29:58.047 --> 30:01.505
Oh, God! Shut up!
You sound like a quacking duck!

30:01.634 --> 30:03.875
[ Shouts ]
Oh, God! Okay.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.097
Come on, Buck!
Come on!

30:07.181 --> 30:09.593
[ Max ]
Come on, Buck.

30:12.228 --> 30:16.062
We’re doomed.
We only needed two pins to win,
and you left them both standing!

30:16.148 --> 30:19.936
- I still got another ball.
- Yeah, right. A 7-10 split.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.360
It’s highly improbable—
statistically approaching
the impossible.

30:23.447 --> 30:27.065
Sometimes when you speak,
it’s like you watch PBS on purpose.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.411
You need two pins.
I’ll get two pins.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.207
- Ho-waah!
- Oh!

30:41.298 --> 30:43.129
- Hey. [ Exhales]
- [ Gasps ]

30:43.217 --> 30:45.173
- [ Both Groan ]
- Booyah!

30:45.261 --> 30:47.798
Something is wrong.
He shouldn’t have
been able to do that.

30:47.888 --> 30:51.722
- Honey, give the man his props.
- Well, I’d like to, but it’s simply improbable.

30:57.606 --> 31:01.690
Okay. Force equals mass
times acceleration. Okay.

31:01.777 --> 31:04.689
To break a nose,
you need a very low force
with a large mass—

31:04.780 --> 31:07.692
say around 30 g’s, or—

31:07.783 --> 31:09.694
No, no, no. Hmm.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.776
This is like
watching Michelle
do her homework.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.532
Maybe I should try to—
Oh, wait!

31:13.622 --> 31:15.783
Hey!
Uh, do you
need me to—

31:15.875 --> 31:18.912
Because the amount of force
it takes to break the victim’s nose
is so low,

31:19.003 --> 31:22.416
it means that
the mass and acceleration
must be fairly low as well.

31:22.506 --> 31:26.044
So, in fact, any mass
over 2.26 kilograms...

31:26.135 --> 31:29.423
wielded at almost any acceleration
would be too much damage.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.298
- So, 2.26 kilograms.
- Five pounds.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.975
The ball could not have weighed
more than five pounds.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.399
What are you doing?
Looking through
Amber’s laptop.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.397
Don’t you need
a warrant for that?

31:45.488 --> 31:49.697
If Buck and I ever
have a child, she will not
turn out like Amber.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.695
Yeah, Temperance,
it’s just us monkeys.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.742
You don’t have to keep up
your cover story.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.206
| find it helpful
to remain in character.

31:56.332 --> 31:59.824
See how she improves
month to month?
Yeah, very impressive.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.919
These are all the statistics
from lane 12.
Yeah, so?

32:04.006 --> 32:08.420
So, there have been some
very difficult splits made
in lane 12, including Booth’s.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.923
You— You think Amber
falsified her records?

32:11.013 --> 32:13.800
I think she tampered
with the lane.

32:13.891 --> 32:17.383
My feet are itching like crazy.
Don’t you fumigate these?

32:17.478 --> 32:19.389
You wear a size 12?
Yeah.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.766
Probably got
Fowler’s shoes.
He never wore socks.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.848
His feet stunk.
We all hated it.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.184
Superstitious bastard.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.691
How do you calibrate
the, uh, pinsetters?

32:29.782 --> 32:31.773
I don’t do anything.
Computers do it all.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.404
So, someone could
reset the pin placement?

32:34.495 --> 32:36.656
Yeah, I guess.
I don’t really give a crap.

32:36.789 --> 32:40.202
What?
I was right. You never could’ve
gotten that 7-10 split.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.669
So you gotta keep
givin’ up hope
on me there?

32:42.753 --> 32:45.460
Oh. Someone got into
the computer system...

32:45.548 --> 32:49.461
and recalibrated lane 12
so the pins set closer together.

32:49.552 --> 32:52.009
That’s why Fowler thought
that lane 12 was lucky.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.675
It’s easier to bowl strikes
and get splits.
I’ll be damned.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.640
Sweets was right.
Fowler was a cheat.

32:57.726 --> 33:01.014
This is Wanda
at the bowling alley.

33:01.105 --> 33:04.347
The size and shape of the injury
indicates that he was killed
with a bowling ball,

33:04.441 --> 33:06.978
but the ball would have
to be five pounds or less.

33:07.069 --> 33:10.482
What, a child’s bowling ball?
Thanks, Wendell.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.689
What’s he saying—
it’s a kid’s ball?

33:12.825 --> 33:15.157
It appears so.
Huh.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.986
Hey, what if it wasn’t Fowler
who rigged the lane?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.695
What if it was Amber?

33:19.790 --> 33:22.748
- Fowler figures it out.
- [ Booth] She kills him.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.827
If we ever had a child
like that—

33:25.921 --> 33:29.914
Oh-ho! That’s never, ever
gonna happen, Wanda. Never.

33:32.178 --> 33:36.137
This is Wanda, the bowler,
at the bowling tournament,
bowling.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.134
Dr. Brennan?
I’m here with Dr. Hodgins.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.056
Is he back
from the baby being born?

33:40.144 --> 33:43.762
Oh, no. Angela’s still in labor.
She’s... stalled or something.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.940
Listen. Tell her that
bowling balls— they don’t
flake, okay? They ch/p.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.733
He said bowling balls
don’t flake.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.358

- Okay. Everybody is getting
a little cranky now.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.666
If what you found was a flake,

34:09.757 --> 34:13.295
that suggests that the murder
weapon was not a bowling ball.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.876
Then what else is made
of polyurethane and flakes?

34:15.971 --> 34:19.054
[ Hodgins ] This type of
polyurethane meets national
traffic safety standards.

34:19.141 --> 34:22.474
You’re looking
for motorcycle helmets
with red sparkles.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.394

34:36.700 --> 34:39.533

34:57.513 --> 34:59.595
- Nobody.
- Aw, this sucks.

Hercules!
We have to
catch a killer.

35:13.904 --> 35:16.896
And then we have to go visit
our friend in the hospital.
You understand.

35:16.991 --> 35:19.573
- Hercules, they’re bailing!
- You’re forfeiting?

35:19.702 --> 35:22.239
What? I don’t wanna
win like that!
Hey, a win is a win.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.407
I’m okay with this.
Oh, I’m not okay with that.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.413

to my helmet?
Looks like blood.

35:34.508 --> 35:38.467

than your bowling average.

35:44.101 --> 35:47.059
Listen, kid. I’m with the FBI.
I’m an FBI. agent.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.764
You watch your mouth!
Hey, you! You’re under arrest
for the murder of Jeff Fowler.

35:50.858 --> 35:53.065
- You run, I swear I’ll shoot you.
- Ow!

35:53.152 --> 35:55.234
- Whoa!
- Dad!

35:55.321 --> 35:57.733
He was gonna run.
I saw it in his eyes.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.690
You know what?
You’d have killed him too.
He never washed his feet.

36:00.784 --> 36:04.493
I mean, look at my hands!
All of my fingernails fell off.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.743
And then my girlfriend
left me for The Raven,
and I really liked her kid.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.370
I didn’t even hit him that hard.
It was just a tap.

36:10.461 --> 36:12.577
Couldn’t you
go easy on him?

36:12.713 --> 36:16.376
Yeah, Jeff Fowler
was a pretty terrible guy.
Let him go.
