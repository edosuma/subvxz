Are you gonna say anything?

01:07.512 --> 01:09.209
What the hell were you thinking, Sam?

01:12.012 --> 01:14.175
You're lucky you just lost your license,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.351
and you know you're paying
for everything, right?

01:16.451 --> 01:17.451
I know.

01:23.371 --> 01:25.025
You're lucky they felt sorry for you.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.949
Wake up, Charles!

01:38.473 --> 01:39.561
Please wake up.

01:41.607 --> 01:43.304
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

01:45.742 --> 01:48.135
You're the one that taught me
to be strong.

02:02.149 --> 02:04.809
Please, Charles.

02:05.152 --> 02:06.967
Tell me who did this!

02:07.067 --> 02:09.709
Previously on
"Every Breath I Take"

02:09.809 --> 02:10.896
Hey, Sarah.

02:12.943 --> 02:13.943
She's alive.

02:47.673 --> 02:48.966
Hey, Sarah.

02:49.066 --> 02:50.141
We didn't do anything wrong.

02:50.241 --> 02:51.677
Hey. Morning.

02:54.724 --> 02:55.899
Afternoon.

02:58.075 --> 03:00.368
What are you doing here,
you're supposed to be at school.

03:00.468 --> 03:03.602
No, I already took my finals
from my first three periods.

03:05.038 --> 03:08.476
French toast on the menu
for you this morning?

03:09.477 --> 03:12.163
Could you please make sure
you sign those three checks?

03:12.263 --> 03:15.483
They're for gas,
electric and your credit card.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.182
Yes, Mr. On-the-Ball.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.012
Where's your bandage?

03:24.841 --> 03:27.744
I thought Audrey killed her son's babysitter
on that speed-boat?

03:30.020 --> 03:32.052
She escaped on a life raft,

03:32.152 --> 03:34.446
spent six months on a desert island
and now she's back

03:34.546 --> 03:35.752
for revenge.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.492
Cool.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.842
Their real mother is...

03:38.942 --> 03:40.321
-No!
-Gotta go.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.193
You're delusional.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.935
Can't you see that you're sick!

03:45.035 --> 03:47.198
Sick, is leaving your babysitter...

03:47.298 --> 03:48.590
OK, have a good day.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.505
...years of caring and...

03:50.605 --> 03:52.999
...Sick, is pretending
to not have any...

03:54.740 --> 03:59.036
Sick, is calling me delusional

03:59.136 --> 04:02.996
when I say they are my children,
just as much as they are yours.

04:03.096 --> 04:04.445
It's not.

04:31.298 --> 04:32.778
Alright, time's up.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.695
Pass your tests and
journals to the right.

04:46.923 --> 04:48.185
Thank you.

04:51.014 --> 04:52.450
Thank you.

04:54.974 --> 04:56.454
Thank you.

04:57.934 --> 04:59.109
Thank you.

05:03.983 --> 05:05.028
Thank you.

05:05.985 --> 05:08.583
Since it is our last day,

05:08.683 --> 05:11.848
I figured it'd be
appropriate to popcorn read

05:11.948 --> 05:14.459
our five year plan assignment.

05:14.559 --> 05:18.724
What will you be
doing in five years?

05:18.824 --> 05:20.260
Who do you want to be?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.743
Maybe somebody we
haven't heard from?

05:27.006 --> 05:28.965
How about Sam?

05:30.183 --> 05:31.183
What?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.740
Read your five
year plan assignment.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.059
It's alright.

05:37.277 --> 05:39.889
You could really use
the participation points.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.425
My mom always told me
that there were two

06:07.525 --> 06:09.514
types of people in the world.

06:09.614 --> 06:11.877
The kind who leave
and the kind who...

06:12.922 --> 06:14.053
stay.

06:23.062 --> 06:24.629
It's all I have actually.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.197
You didn't finish?

06:33.029 --> 06:34.421
Who really knows, am I right?

06:39.513 --> 06:40.950
Take your seat.

06:42.516 --> 06:44.070
Well,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.781
who else would like
to have an opportunity?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.736
- Hold still, road-rash.
- Just take it.

06:57.836 --> 07:00.260
Can you act like you're not
about to be executed?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.188
Just for a second, c'mon.

07:09.587 --> 07:11.619
That's the winner right there.

07:11.719 --> 07:13.447
On the old mantle
piece, you know.

07:13.547 --> 07:16.537
Bobby, that's great. Thank you.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.235
Where are your
parents, by the way?

07:18.335 --> 07:19.889
I don't know, probably at home

07:19.989 --> 07:22.021
converting my bedroom
into a new office.

07:22.121 --> 07:23.588
- No.
- No,

07:23.688 --> 07:25.255
they're fartin'
around here somewhere.

07:30.086 --> 07:31.739
Do you want me to get
a picture with you two?

07:32.653 --> 07:33.903
Who?

07:34.003 --> 07:35.774
Ellie! Ellie Vaughn.

07:35.874 --> 07:39.169
Well that would require
Sam to talk to her first

07:39.269 --> 07:41.084
rather than breathing
heavily in her direction.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.999
We talk all the time,
it's not a big deal.

07:43.099 --> 07:45.262
Ah, buddy.

07:45.362 --> 07:48.352
I will never forget the
story about the gym shorts.

07:48.452 --> 07:50.223
Mom, can you open
the door please?

07:50.323 --> 07:52.704
Story time, I love
story time. Do tell.

07:52.804 --> 07:54.662
Well, OK. It was seventh grade

07:54.762 --> 07:57.274
and Ellie had been chosen by the
teachers to write everybody's

07:57.374 --> 07:59.754
-names in their gym shorts.
-Oh, yeah.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.802
And Sam came home that day,
still wearing the shorts.

08:03.902 --> 08:05.369
He said:

08:05.469 --> 08:08.328
"Mom, do you know who wrote

08:08.428 --> 08:10.069
my name in these shorts?

08:10.169 --> 08:12.158
The most beautiful
girl in the world."

08:12.258 --> 08:14.508
-Oh, my God. That's...
-I know.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.423
I'm gonna cry, dude.
That's sweet.

08:16.523 --> 08:19.731
He was just so taken by her
that he didn't realize that

08:19.831 --> 08:22.486
she hadn't written Nimitz,
she'd written Nimnuts.

08:23.443 --> 08:24.779
-And that--
-Wait,

08:24.879 --> 08:26.577
that's the origin of Nimnuts?

08:27.665 --> 08:30.220
Everything makes sense. They've
been calling him that for years.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.352
Yeah, it was so sweet.

08:32.452 --> 08:35.181
Yeah, just a magical
childhood memory.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.053
Why don't we tell
it a little louder?

08:37.153 --> 08:39.316
Dude, c'mon, man. Don't go
all Samming the mood on us.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.578
What does that mean,
Samming the mood?

08:41.679 --> 08:44.625
It's just a term I've
coined for when Sam just

08:44.725 --> 08:47.541
gets his vibe all
off-putting and depressing.

08:47.641 --> 08:51.254
-C'mon now, be nice.
-Only half kidding, half not.

08:52.255 --> 08:54.070
Anyways, I'm gonna go
find the parental units.

08:54.170 --> 08:56.028
-Bobby.
-Always a pleasure.

08:56.128 --> 08:58.335
-Well done.
-Thank you. Hey, Sam.

08:58.435 --> 09:00.250
You, me, tonight.

09:00.350 --> 09:02.078
Our old friends, fun,
laughter and merriment.

09:02.178 --> 09:04.210
Remember them?
We're gonna be hangin', man.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.778
Whether you like it or not.
See ya later, man.

09:06.878 --> 09:08.606
Bye, Bobby.
Congratulations.

09:08.706 --> 09:10.186
Thanks.

09:16.496 --> 09:19.878
-He's just looking out for you.
-Bobby looking out for me?

09:19.978 --> 09:23.229
Yeah, of course he is. You guys
have been friends forever.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.941
No, he's my neighbor.
He's geographically obligated.

09:35.472 --> 09:37.765
Sam, would you
please do me a favor

09:37.865 --> 09:39.389
and have a good time tonight?

09:40.564 --> 09:42.248
'Cause you know what
tomorrow is, right?

09:42.348 --> 09:43.654
Job hunting. Yes.

09:44.698 --> 09:46.600
-Every cent, I mean it.
-Yes.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.255
I will start looking tomorrow.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.270
-OK?
-OK.

09:56.232 --> 09:59.135
Alta Loma High
is at Disneyland right now.

09:59.235 --> 10:01.324
Then Alta Loma High can suck it.

10:04.457 --> 10:07.230
Hey, the party's over here,
buddy. You know that?

10:07.330 --> 10:09.449
-OK.
-Come a little closer.

10:09.549 --> 10:11.551
C'mon, man. Cuddle up, man.

10:13.727 --> 10:15.164
What's your do?

10:17.775 --> 10:22.506
Bobby, we have to think of
a way to make our grad night

10:22.606 --> 10:26.205
way better than Alta Loma High.

10:26.305 --> 10:29.178
I mean, there's a few
things that come to my mind.

10:31.528 --> 10:33.430
So, just please clarify this.

10:33.530 --> 10:37.447
Well, I was gonna look really
good in my grad night dress.

10:38.448 --> 10:39.740
And you missed it.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.320
Why don't
you put it on?

10:52.505 --> 10:54.277
Stop. Calm down.

10:54.377 --> 10:56.453
- It's not a big deal.
- No, stop.

10:56.553 --> 10:59.020
-Just calm down.
-Just do what you want.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.167
-Calm down.
-Just get away from me!

11:32.980 --> 11:33.980
Hey.

11:35.592 --> 11:36.810
Can I sit?

11:38.116 --> 11:39.813
It's a public swing set.

11:47.691 --> 11:49.070
I'm Sam.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.768
I know who you are.

11:50.868 --> 11:52.596
No, I know. It's just that
there are a lot of kids,

11:52.696 --> 11:56.700
-and a lot of people.
-You're Sam Nimitz.

11:58.745 --> 11:59.745
Yeah.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.998
You wore your gym shorts with
your name wrong in them

12:04.098 --> 12:06.275
for two years 'cause of me.

12:09.582 --> 12:12.311
Kids from that class
still call me Samnuts

12:12.411 --> 12:14.922
or "Nimnuts".

12:15.022 --> 12:16.022
Just assholes.

12:17.373 --> 12:18.635
Sorry.

12:20.201 --> 12:23.583
Actually I have this thing,
it's kinda like a grad night

12:23.683 --> 12:26.020
hit-list and I came over
here to kill you,

12:26.120 --> 12:29.167
but you apologized
so we're cool now.

12:31.343 --> 12:33.040
Thank you for sparing me.

12:38.176 --> 12:39.438
Are you OK?

12:41.440 --> 12:45.052
Yeah, I'm a little drunk.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.220
-Do you want some?
-No.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.570
Thank you. I don't really drink.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.746
How come?

12:55.846 --> 12:58.314
It's a little personal.

12:58.414 --> 12:59.676
OK, well. Just

13:00.633 --> 13:03.810
for the record,
I saw you reading my journal.

13:05.290 --> 13:08.759
So, I think you owe me something
a little personal at this point,

13:08.859 --> 13:10.848
just to make things even.

13:10.948 --> 13:13.516
-I was not.
-C'mon.

13:16.127 --> 13:17.302
OK.

13:19.043 --> 13:20.988
I think I might be at some

13:21.088 --> 13:22.612
type of genetic...

13:23.700 --> 13:25.963
disposition,
'cause my dad drank a lot.

13:27.443 --> 13:29.345
I dunno, maybe that's
a weird reason.

13:29.445 --> 13:31.098
No, that's not weird.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.539
It's an extreme all or nothing
attitude, but it's not weird.

13:37.888 --> 13:41.574
I dunno, I just don't
wanna end up like that too

13:41.674 --> 13:44.068
I guess. I dunno,
kind of a fear of mine.

13:46.331 --> 13:47.593
Do you have anything like that?

13:52.163 --> 13:56.341
I try to live my life
without any expectations.

13:58.648 --> 14:01.128
'Cause who really gets the
life they planned on, right?

14:05.263 --> 14:07.918
And spoiler alert, we all end
up like our parents anyway.

14:09.572 --> 14:10.877
Is that not

14:11.965 --> 14:14.390
and expectation in itself?

14:14.490 --> 14:16.622
No, 'cause it's fact.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.233
Trust me.

14:21.714 --> 14:24.151
Transformation is inevitable.

14:31.594 --> 14:35.411
Nimitz... Your dad,
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

14:35.511 --> 14:37.282
-I'm sorry.
-It's OK.

14:37.382 --> 14:40.429
No, it's not OK. It's a horrible
thing to say. I'm sorry.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.551
Do you think
I'm a huge bitch now?

14:45.651 --> 14:47.392
No, honestly it's...

14:49.176 --> 14:50.513
You just got put
back on my hit-list

14:50.613 --> 14:52.397
so that kinda sucks for you.

14:55.922 --> 14:58.055
Well, I think it's cool
that you don't drink.

15:00.797 --> 15:02.873
I kinda want more people
like you in my life,

15:02.973 --> 15:04.453
you know, just to keep me
out of trouble.

15:06.455 --> 15:07.499
Yeah?

15:08.892 --> 15:10.502
So what are you doin' this summer?

15:11.547 --> 15:14.101
Uh, pretty open.

15:14.201 --> 15:15.202
You?

15:16.987 --> 15:19.933
I leave in August for
Rochester in New York,

15:20.033 --> 15:22.079
but that's about it.

15:22.949 --> 15:25.909
-That's awesome. For what?
-Their music conservatory.

15:28.085 --> 15:29.813
-That's what you wanna do?
-Yeah.

15:29.913 --> 15:32.916
Something with music.
It also runs in the family.

15:38.095 --> 15:41.259
And I'm supposed to get a
summer job, so there's that.

15:41.359 --> 15:43.709
Really? Because
I might have something.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.583
- Babe.
- Oh, God.

15:48.975 --> 15:51.269
-Come dance with me, c'mon.
-I'm sorry did you forget

15:51.369 --> 15:53.793
-we had a fight or...?
-I'm sorry, that was like

15:53.893 --> 15:55.795
forever ago. Come dance with me.

15:55.895 --> 15:57.331
C'mon.

16:00.596 --> 16:01.727
Alright.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.126
-C'mon, I wanna dance, c'mon.
-OK.

16:09.996 --> 16:11.781
I'll see you this summer, Nimitz.

16:50.167 --> 16:52.461
The guys will be out here
soon with the jumper thingies.

16:52.561 --> 16:57.074
Did you purposefully leave
the lights on all night?

16:57.174 --> 16:59.045
No, Amy and I came
out here and...

17:00.481 --> 17:01.948
Well...

17:02.048 --> 17:03.776
Let's just say I'm
a lights on kinda guy.

17:03.876 --> 17:05.182
OK, no.

17:09.272 --> 17:12.406
What did you do? Just jack-off
in the jungle gym all night?

17:14.104 --> 17:17.411
No, actually I hung out
with somebody.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.412
Oh, yeah?

17:20.284 --> 17:21.284
Who?

17:22.460 --> 17:23.548
Ellie Vaughn.

17:24.505 --> 17:26.582
-No way. Are you serious?
-Yeah,

17:26.682 --> 17:29.149
it was really random actually.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.760
No, you're lying to me.

17:30.860 --> 17:32.718
-Who'd you hang out with?
-I'm not lying!

17:32.818 --> 17:34.124
Oh, my God!

17:35.865 --> 17:38.376
Dude, that girl is major
pipe, so how was that?

17:38.476 --> 17:39.869
OK. Wrong question,
dumb question.

17:40.913 --> 17:43.250
-Please tell me you made a move.
-No. Pipe?

17:43.350 --> 17:46.484
What? No, we talked.
That's it. What?

17:49.530 --> 17:50.880
You gotta make that shit
happen, man.

17:52.708 --> 17:56.742
Nah, I dunno. She kind of
hinted hanging out, but...

17:56.842 --> 18:00.703
Uh, OK. Dawg, anytime a girl
eludes to hanging out with you,

18:00.803 --> 18:02.356
that's your cue
to make it happen.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.054
Don't let this slip
through your fingers.

18:04.154 --> 18:06.809
-Not this, not Ellie Vaughn.
-Really?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.769
Dawg, I'm here for you.

18:11.857 --> 18:12.902
Alright?

18:15.731 --> 18:17.546
Ellie Vaughn, man!

18:17.646 --> 18:18.821
That's exciting!

18:21.040 --> 18:22.651
Jesus and all his blessings.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.924
Alright, dawg.

18:39.232 --> 18:41.091
Hey, good work
nice, fine soldier.

18:41.191 --> 18:42.409
Proud of you.

18:50.026 --> 18:51.971
Hey, Sam, it's your aunt.

18:52.071 --> 18:54.495
Just wondering what you're gonna do
for your moms birthday.

18:54.595 --> 18:58.164
You two can't hide out in that
fortress forever. Call me.

18:59.557 --> 19:01.807
Hey, it's Ellie Vaughn,

19:01.907 --> 19:04.331
I'm calling for Sam Nimitz.

19:04.431 --> 19:11.003
909-508-3212
is the number. Alrighty.

19:30.414 --> 19:31.545
Hi.

19:32.590 --> 19:33.590
Hi.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.451
May 2002, freshman year,

19:37.551 --> 19:41.630
"Ellie, have a great summer.
Maybe I'll see you around.

19:41.730 --> 19:46.865
909-921-5805.
Take Care. Sam."

19:48.737 --> 19:51.117
Look at you just smoothly trying
to give me your phone number

19:51.217 --> 19:52.392
four years ago.

19:53.350 --> 19:56.122
-You never called.
-Who reads these things?

19:56.222 --> 19:57.428
I do?

19:57.528 --> 19:58.964
Figured you'd say that.

20:00.357 --> 20:01.880
You're looking for
a summer job, yeah?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.492
The search starts today.

20:06.842 --> 20:09.005
I work at Video Flicks,
it's that really shitty

20:09.105 --> 20:11.007
video store off
and Baseline

20:11.107 --> 20:13.718
And we're looking for
someone if you're interested.

20:15.198 --> 20:17.927
Yes. Yeah.

20:18.027 --> 20:23.628
Yeah, should I like, I dunno,
fill out an application?

20:23.728 --> 20:25.034
Can you be here
in thirty minutes?

21:11.297 --> 21:13.591
Don't worry, it's tradition.
Every time someone quits

21:13.691 --> 21:15.301
they get to destroy the wall.

21:18.783 --> 21:21.512
-Hey, bro. You're Sam?
-Yes.

21:21.612 --> 21:23.906
-J.D., General manager.
-Hi.

21:24.006 --> 21:26.225
Come hang out in my office.

21:32.405 --> 21:33.742
What's your story?

21:33.842 --> 21:35.178
I don't normally
hire someone unless

21:35.278 --> 21:36.962
they can give me
six month commitment

21:37.062 --> 21:39.182
and Ellie here tells me that
you're leaving in August.

21:39.282 --> 21:42.620
Right, yeah.
I'm going to school.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.884
I have to pay off
some bills before I go.

21:45.984 --> 21:48.278
Bills? What?

21:48.378 --> 21:50.367
You're like, 12.
What bills do you have?

21:50.467 --> 21:52.891
Um... It's...

21:52.991 --> 21:57.678
I crashed my dad's truck
and I have to

21:57.778 --> 22:00.259
pay off the damages.
It's not a big deal.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.089
Yeah.

22:07.353 --> 22:08.572
I've been there, dude.

22:10.182 --> 22:12.171
Alright...

22:12.271 --> 22:14.217
Yeah, I can...

22:14.317 --> 22:16.088
I can hook you up with
a part time till you leave.

22:16.188 --> 22:17.568
Thank you.

22:17.668 --> 22:19.148
You have a form of transportation?

22:21.106 --> 22:25.706
Nah. I got my license
suspended because...

22:25.806 --> 22:28.274
-I can give him rides.
-Really?

22:28.374 --> 22:30.886
Yeah, I'm here every day anyway.

22:30.986 --> 22:32.235
Thank you.

22:32.335 --> 22:34.367
Alrighty then.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.282
-Welcome to the team.
-Thank you.

22:36.382 --> 22:38.602
-Ellie will show you around.
-Yup.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.151
Came out a little big.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.002
Do you...?

22:50.222 --> 22:51.684
It's the only one we have.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.432
-OK.
-Wash it on hot a few times.

22:55.532 --> 22:56.925
Here, follow me.

22:59.275 --> 23:01.394
Each day you're gonna need
to straighten the wall

23:01.494 --> 23:03.962
which requires you to walk
up and down the DVD aisles

23:04.062 --> 23:05.355
and make sure everything's

23:05.455 --> 23:07.183
straight enough for presentation.

23:07.283 --> 23:09.185
They're Nazis about it.
Trust me,

23:09.285 --> 23:11.635
you're gonna have nightmares
about shoveling DVD shelves.

23:18.424 --> 23:19.556
See?

23:21.297 --> 23:24.156
OK. It's easy enough.

23:24.256 --> 23:26.737
Alight, you go down there
and you start. I'll be here.

23:54.591 --> 23:55.971
Well,

23:56.071 --> 23:58.364
-good first day, Sam.
-Thank--

23:58.464 --> 24:00.292
Thank you, J.D.

24:02.077 --> 24:03.339
Have a good night!

24:08.039 --> 24:09.375
Do you know of any
places open late

24:09.475 --> 24:10.476
like for food?

24:11.738 --> 24:15.077
Yes, off of Haven and Baseline.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.353
Cool, OK. I'll follow
you over there.

24:18.658 --> 24:19.790
Wait, how did you get here?

24:21.183 --> 24:22.227
Friend took me.

24:28.538 --> 24:31.223
Is that your scooter over there?

24:31.323 --> 24:33.151
Is that yours?

24:36.067 --> 24:39.201
-That? No.
-No?

24:49.167 --> 24:52.157
It's good that your
expectations are like down here.

24:52.257 --> 24:55.595
-Yeah?
-Because it's not about to...

24:55.695 --> 24:57.828
-Blow my mind?
-...blow your mind, yeah.

24:58.829 --> 25:00.613
-You ready?
-OK.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.793
Yeah, OK. Ready? Alright.

25:12.364 --> 25:13.949
Oh, my God.

25:14.149 --> 25:15.189
Yeah.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.166
I need more, like twelve more.

25:20.385 --> 25:21.602
- They're the best.
-Yeah.

25:21.703 --> 25:22.905
They're the best donuts.

25:24.507 --> 25:25.682
So.

25:28.092 --> 25:30.099
Why Video Flicks?

25:31.644 --> 25:33.546
It pays. I dunno.

25:33.646 --> 25:36.549
-I've had a lot of jobs.
-I wouldn't think that.

25:36.649 --> 25:39.217
Why? 'Cause I hang out
with a bunch of entitled brats

25:39.317 --> 25:41.132
who's parents pay for everything?

25:43.743 --> 25:45.689
Well, when you put it like that.

25:45.789 --> 25:48.887
Hey, it's a social circle
we share, that's it.

25:49.445 --> 25:51.895
-Sorry, I didn't mean anything.
-No worries, it's fine.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.793
I've been working
since I was 16.

25:56.147 --> 25:58.919
What about college,
aren't you leaving soon?

25:59.019 --> 26:03.111
Yeah, I'm figuring it out.
Weighing my options.

26:04.938 --> 26:08.507
Which is code for "no clue",
so there's that.

26:13.425 --> 26:14.935
Is Zach

26:15.035 --> 26:16.459
one of those options?

26:16.559 --> 26:17.864
Wait, what?

26:18.691 --> 26:22.073
You... I mean, it has to
be more complicated making

26:22.173 --> 26:24.436
a decision when you have
Zach to consider too, right?

26:25.394 --> 26:28.384
Is that your sly way
of asking me if

26:28.484 --> 26:30.212
like I have a boyfriend?

26:30.312 --> 26:31.865
No.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.358
Zach and I are on a break.

26:34.272 --> 26:36.144
OK. What does that mean?

26:37.188 --> 26:38.407
Just that we're not talking.

26:39.451 --> 26:41.397
But you're together.

26:41.497 --> 26:45.009
Yeah, sometimes things
aren't one way or the other.

26:45.109 --> 26:46.109
OK.

26:47.503 --> 26:49.592
-That's fair.
-Anyway, I...

26:50.897 --> 26:52.029
I like this.

26:53.248 --> 26:54.901
-What?
-This.

26:56.076 --> 26:57.848
I'm starting to realize
that all of my friends

26:57.948 --> 27:00.242
for the past four years
have just been party friends.

27:00.342 --> 27:03.506
-What do you mean?
-Party friends, like

27:03.606 --> 27:05.421
friends you get trashed with

27:05.521 --> 27:08.032
or friends you talk about
nothing with.

27:08.132 --> 27:10.165
Like, it's not real.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.616
Yeah.

27:16.271 --> 27:18.621
I'm not used to hanging out
with anyone at all.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.586
C'mon, let's get you home.

27:41.078 --> 27:42.819
See you tomorrow for work.

27:46.736 --> 27:48.085
Are you tired?

27:53.221 --> 27:55.166
No.

27:55.266 --> 27:56.572
Me neither.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.407
It's over here.

28:19.334 --> 28:20.987
Wait, you live in a recording studio?

28:23.729 --> 28:25.762
Yeah, it used to be a garage,

28:25.862 --> 28:27.255
my dad converted it.

28:28.517 --> 28:30.040
He was a musician too?

28:31.563 --> 28:34.771
He was in a bunch of bands
when he was younger,

28:34.871 --> 28:37.469
but he made a living off of commercials...

28:37.569 --> 28:38.962
He wrote songs for commercials.

28:42.357 --> 28:44.237
These were his guitars?

28:44.837 --> 28:46.143
They're mine now.

28:49.364 --> 28:50.364
Right.

28:55.544 --> 28:58.838
"A poetic demise"?

28:58.938 --> 29:00.897
Do I have to tell you about that?

29:02.072 --> 29:03.192
Yeah.

29:04.292 --> 29:08.252
It's this little stupid
band Bobby and I had...

29:09.384 --> 29:12.387
a long time ago.
He lives next door.

29:13.431 --> 29:15.594
He's my neighbor.

29:15.694 --> 29:17.640
-It's a pretty expressive name.
-Yeah.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.350
Those were not subtle years.

29:20.351 --> 29:21.657
What's with the recorder?

29:24.529 --> 29:26.257
Bobby's parents

29:26.357 --> 29:28.955
felt he was spending too
much time with the band,

29:29.055 --> 29:32.394
something about not wanting
him to end up homeless,

29:32.494 --> 29:35.875
so they sent him to a math camp

29:35.975 --> 29:38.008
for young entrepreneurs

29:38.108 --> 29:39.327
one summer.

29:40.937 --> 29:43.927
So my dad bought us that

29:44.027 --> 29:46.843
voice recorder and we
recorded music tracks on it,

29:46.943 --> 29:49.062
sent it back and forth all summer.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.163
Cute.

29:51.251 --> 29:52.514
So, you any good?

29:53.776 --> 29:54.776
I'm OK.

29:56.431 --> 29:58.563
Rochester's one of the best
music schools, right?

29:59.521 --> 30:01.031
Yeah, something like that.

30:01.131 --> 30:03.381
OK. So...

30:03.481 --> 30:06.049
you're a little
better than good.

30:07.137 --> 30:08.137
Play me something.

30:10.445 --> 30:14.349
OK. You know, you play
me something now

30:14.449 --> 30:18.657
or I listen to a track
from a poetic demise.

30:18.757 --> 30:21.760
-That's pure evil.
-C'mon.

30:29.725 --> 30:31.204
-Put the recorder down!
-OK.

30:35.165 --> 30:37.602
-This is a work in progress.
-No disclaimers.

30:44.087 --> 30:46.045

34:17.474 --> 34:18.549
What do you mean?

34:18.649 --> 34:20.433
Your face when you were playing.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.005
I just wish I was that
passionate about anything.

34:30.181 --> 34:31.619
Maybe you are.

34:47.809 --> 34:49.201
I'm pregnant.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.495
What?

34:54.685 --> 34:55.904
Sorry.

34:56.774 --> 34:58.446
- That was abrupt.
- No.

34:59.646 --> 35:01.218
No it's... Fu...

35:02.780 --> 35:06.958
What? But you were
drinking on grad night.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.444
I like you, Sam.

35:16.707 --> 35:19.449
But I'm not really an all or nothing
sort of person like you.

35:21.712 --> 35:23.018
Wait, what do you mean?

35:25.063 --> 35:26.543
Can we talk about it later?

35:41.427 --> 35:42.472
Hey.

35:44.039 --> 35:45.475
Hey, wake up.

35:50.175 --> 35:52.469
Hi. Gotta go to work.

35:52.569 --> 35:53.875
Get up.

36:03.972 --> 36:06.004
-Hey, mom.
-Hey, Sam.

36:06.104 --> 36:07.932
I thought you were
staying at Bobby's.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.097
-Hi, Ellie.
-Hey, Miss Nimitz.

36:12.197 --> 36:14.143
-Hey.
-We're just goin' to work.

36:14.243 --> 36:15.432
You got a job?

36:15.733 --> 36:17.146
Video Flicks.

36:19.014 --> 36:20.226
Look at that.

36:20.827 --> 36:22.761
I didn't know they were
still open, is that...?

36:22.904 --> 36:24.196
-No, that's cool.
-Good to see you.

36:24.296 --> 36:26.242
And you. That's...

36:26.342 --> 36:28.035
Have a good day, kids.

36:38.310 --> 36:41.618
What's with the men's
pj's on the couch?

36:43.838 --> 36:45.740
They're my dad's.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.799
She wears them when I'm not
around or thinks I'm not.

36:49.844 --> 36:52.585
She hasn't slept in
their bed since, well...

36:54.196 --> 36:56.720
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

36:59.288 --> 37:01.364
At least you guys still
have each other.

37:01.464 --> 37:02.639
You know, after everything.

37:04.162 --> 37:06.077
-You're right.
-Yeah.

37:12.954 --> 37:16.161
Actually, no. We don't
really talk at all.

37:16.261 --> 37:18.133
I don't know why
I lied just then.

37:40.242 --> 37:42.753
OK. Just wait right there.

37:42.853 --> 37:44.886
Boys, wake up!
Just 'cause it's summer

37:44.986 --> 37:46.814
doesn't mean you get
to sleep all day!

37:49.381 --> 37:50.861
Hey, let's go.

37:52.515 --> 37:54.373
C'mon, you're mine.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.811
Ah, you're
mine. We're gonna eat breakfast!

37:56.911 --> 37:59.291
We're gonna eat all the goodies.

37:59.391 --> 38:02.830
Alright. So we're
gonna do cereal...

38:03.787 --> 38:05.123
a...

38:05.223 --> 38:07.747
No phones. I said
no phones this year.

38:10.011 --> 38:11.142
Yeah?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.396
Yeah? Here we go.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.455
--Yeah? Alright.

38:24.721 --> 38:27.506
- Good morning.
- I have work, so I'm gonna go.

38:29.117 --> 38:31.193
Alright, bye.

38:31.293 --> 38:32.368
How are my boys.

38:32.468 --> 38:33.773
Cool, you ready?

38:45.568 --> 38:47.252
Sorry to do this to you, but

38:47.352 --> 38:49.167
this morning I'm gonna
need you to call everybody

38:49.267 --> 38:50.573
on the 30 day list.

38:51.879 --> 38:53.793
OK, what is that?

38:55.099 --> 38:57.001
It's a list

38:57.101 --> 39:00.048
of everybody who's checked out a
movie for more than thirty days.

39:00.148 --> 39:01.397
OK.

39:01.497 --> 39:03.107
You got any tips?

39:04.195 --> 39:05.893
Don't let 'em kill your spirit.

39:10.332 --> 39:11.594
OK.

39:29.307 --> 39:32.254
-Yeah?
-Hello, is this Mr. Foster?

39:32.354 --> 39:35.213
-Who the fuck's askin'?
-Oh, um...

39:35.313 --> 39:38.477
This is Sam from Video Flicks.

39:38.577 --> 39:41.393
I'm calling about the
copy of Mona Lisa Smile

39:41.493 --> 39:43.743
that you rented in January

39:43.843 --> 39:45.789
and you've yet to return.

39:45.889 --> 39:48.674
Sounds like my snake ex-wife
is still using my account.

39:50.024 --> 39:53.766
Actually it says that you're
the only one with access.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.205
-So... -Are you calling me a liar?

40:01.339 --> 40:03.024
Sorry, excuse me?

40:03.124 --> 40:05.461
Jesus, kid. Are you
even paying attention?

40:05.561 --> 40:07.824
What kind of DVD-jockey are you?

40:13.003 --> 40:14.949
Mr. Foster, right?

40:15.049 --> 40:18.169
-How'd you know?
-He's a regular.

40:18.269 --> 40:19.618
Don't take it personal.

40:23.187 --> 40:24.436
What the hell is this?

40:24.536 --> 40:26.221
Oh, here we go.

40:26.321 --> 40:29.877
Do you realize that a cat
washes down a gigantic waterfall

40:29.977 --> 40:32.227
in this movie, and survives?

40:32.327 --> 40:33.589
A waterfall.

40:34.503 --> 40:36.013
It's a kids' movie.

40:36.113 --> 40:37.710
Oh, wow. This place is
losing its way, man.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.583
First these stupid
grape shirts, now the

40:40.683 --> 40:44.021
required factory films
where animals are surviving

40:44.121 --> 40:46.284
totally impossible
dangers, giving kids

40:46.384 --> 40:48.983
impractical expectations
for their own lives.

40:49.083 --> 40:50.985
What can I say, Gus.

40:51.085 --> 40:53.813
Corporate wasn't too keen on
you showing "Y tu Mama Tambie"

40:53.913 --> 40:56.294
-on every afternoon.
-Y tu Mamá También

40:56.394 --> 40:59.397
is a beautiful, perfect film,
and corporate is stupid.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.565
-Who are you, who's this?
-This is Sam, friend of Ellie's.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.916
And yes, he is of working age.

41:09.016 --> 41:10.874
He's gonna be with
us until August.

41:10.974 --> 41:12.702
Nice to meet ya,
how are you doin'?

41:12.802 --> 41:14.182
You like shit like this?

41:14.282 --> 41:17.446
Oh, um. Yeah, when I was a kid.

41:17.546 --> 41:19.504
Don't worry, I'll show
you some real movies.

41:20.418 --> 41:22.594
-Hey, Gus.
-Hey, Ellie. How's it goin'.

41:23.726 --> 41:27.151
You look good today.
Saw you brought in the new kid.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.023
-Yeah, be nice.
-Always.

41:29.123 --> 41:31.416
-Should we initiate him tonight?
-I dunno.

41:31.516 --> 41:33.853
What are you talking about?

41:33.953 --> 41:36.682
Every Friday night Gus
screens a movie on the roof,

41:36.782 --> 41:38.119
it's kind of a ritual.

41:38.219 --> 41:39.685
Not bullshit
like this, I promise.

41:39.785 --> 41:41.831
-Important stuff.
-Cool, I wanna go.

41:43.615 --> 41:45.430
-OK.
-Yeah, we'll think about it.

41:45.530 --> 41:47.171
Just joking, kiddo.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.739
- Cool.
- No way that golden retriever

41:49.839 --> 41:51.175
would make it out there alive.

41:51.275 --> 41:53.308
It's a golden retriever!

41:53.408 --> 41:54.700
You ever seen a movie
that shows

41:54.800 --> 41:56.702
16 minutes
of a tree growing?

41:56.802 --> 41:58.704
That's the kind of crap
we're gonna watch tonight.

41:58.804 --> 42:01.807
Talking about my first short
film right now? Wanna go there?

43:19.929 --> 43:23.572
-Oh, look who showed up.
-Sorry I'm late.

43:23.672 --> 43:25.313
Did I miss the screening?

43:25.413 --> 43:28.011
We were just about to play
hide and seek, you in?

43:28.111 --> 43:31.058
Oh, I'm just gonna hang out.

43:31.158 --> 43:34.365
-If it's cool.
-Suit yourself.

43:34.465 --> 43:36.759
Everybody form up on me
over in the drama section,

43:36.859 --> 43:38.413
we're gonna discuss the rules.

43:38.513 --> 43:40.458
Alright, guys. Follow me.

43:40.558 --> 43:42.821
We don't need to know the rules
'cause it's hide and seek.

43:46.129 --> 43:47.696
What are you
thinking about?

43:49.045 --> 43:53.080
Thinking about how there's
a child inside of you,

43:53.180 --> 43:54.398
firstly.

43:56.792 --> 43:58.010
What are you gonna do?

43:59.490 --> 44:02.058
What do you think?
I have an appointment.

44:04.365 --> 44:07.703
Yeah, just imagining
a life with Zach,

44:07.803 --> 44:10.109
a life with like my mom's,
I just can't.

44:13.809 --> 44:15.667
Why do you care so much anyway?

44:15.767 --> 44:18.030
You trying to be my
boyfriend or something?

44:23.340 --> 44:26.038
Just a friend looking out
for a friend.

44:30.434 --> 44:31.740
Just checking.

44:32.784 --> 44:34.003
What else is on your mind?

44:35.700 --> 44:37.211
Nothing.

44:37.311 --> 44:39.387
They're playing hide
and seek for three hours,

44:39.487 --> 44:40.705
I'm gonna get it out of you.

44:47.538 --> 44:49.484
Found all these photos

44:49.584 --> 44:51.586
of my mom with this guy.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.143
-Some guy before my dad.
-Like a high school boyfriend?

44:56.243 --> 44:57.666
No.

44:57.766 --> 44:59.246
It was serious,
they were engaged.

45:00.334 --> 45:01.813
There were all these letters.

45:03.946 --> 45:05.121
Did you read them?

45:06.340 --> 45:07.384
You did.

45:10.518 --> 45:13.551
They were so different.

45:13.651 --> 45:15.249
Different how?

45:15.349 --> 45:17.729
My mom really loved this guy.

45:17.829 --> 45:19.905
She loved my dad

45:20.005 --> 45:22.660
too, but these letters...

45:24.749 --> 45:27.491
Every single one of them
was about forever.

45:28.797 --> 45:30.786
My parents never
talked like that.

45:30.886 --> 45:32.440
-Have you asked her about that?
-No.

45:32.540 --> 45:34.703
I don't think she's
ready to talk

45:34.803 --> 45:38.402
about anything,
but especially this.

45:38.502 --> 45:40.156
Why don't you let
her decide that.

45:42.027 --> 45:43.494
Why do you care so much?

45:43.594 --> 45:44.887
Trying to be my girlfriend
or something?

45:44.987 --> 45:46.815
No, no way.

45:50.906 --> 45:52.721
Thank you for caring.

45:52.821 --> 45:54.083
Of course.

46:03.179 --> 46:05.094
Tag, you're it, fresh meat!

46:06.530 --> 46:08.097
I think
you'd better run.

46:17.585 --> 46:19.226
Hey, what's up?

46:19.326 --> 46:21.053
You didn't go to bed?

46:21.153 --> 46:23.795
You ready?
One, two, three.

46:23.895 --> 46:25.275
Oh, yeah.

46:25.375 --> 46:28.247
Hey, guys. Ready?
Let's go to bed.

46:30.206 --> 46:31.206
OK.

46:35.646 --> 46:37.082
My room's the first door
on the left.

47:44.019 --> 47:46.008
You have good taste in movies.

47:46.108 --> 47:47.762
-That surprise you?
-No.

47:48.980 --> 47:50.068
Just saying.

47:51.418 --> 47:53.232
Your...

47:53.332 --> 47:56.510
mom's gonna be cool with me
bein' over here this late?

47:58.250 --> 48:00.196
Yeah, we don't have
what you'd call a normal

48:00.296 --> 48:01.645
parent - child relationship.

48:02.733 --> 48:04.648
Yeah, I can relate.

48:07.651 --> 48:08.651
Yeah.

48:10.524 --> 48:11.524
Confession.

48:12.917 --> 48:16.168
I knew that I wrote your
name wrong in your gym shorts.

48:16.268 --> 48:18.053
I was just too shy to tell you.

48:20.577 --> 48:23.611
No, you? Shy?
I can't imagine it.

48:23.711 --> 48:26.440
I was, it was the first day

48:26.540 --> 48:29.747
and there was this
cute guy and I was...

48:29.847 --> 48:30.848
M...

48:32.589 --> 48:34.317
--Me, cute?

48:34.417 --> 48:36.363
Yeah, you were!

48:36.463 --> 48:39.770
You had this big brown
moppy head of hair.

48:40.641 --> 48:42.151
You were...

48:42.251 --> 48:44.588
cute.

48:44.688 --> 48:46.329
You're...

48:46.429 --> 48:47.691
a little sadder...

48:48.953 --> 48:51.290
a little more lost,
but you're cute.

48:51.390 --> 48:53.467
Still cute.

48:53.567 --> 48:54.916
Ellie...

48:59.094 --> 49:00.443
You don't know...

49:01.879 --> 49:04.129
how badly

49:04.229 --> 49:07.276
I've wanted to know you
ever since that day.

49:10.801 --> 49:12.194
I'm sorry I took so long.

49:14.370 --> 49:16.503
I forgive you, again.

49:17.939 --> 49:19.767
-Am I back off your hit-list?
-For now.

49:21.595 --> 49:24.062
Is that why you didn't wanna
read your five year plan essay?

49:24.162 --> 49:25.934
Just 'cause it was
like a huge list of

49:26.034 --> 49:27.675
all these people
you were gonna kill?

49:27.775 --> 49:29.603
I was hoping you'd
forget about that.

49:30.865 --> 49:33.955
Wait, let me see
if I remember correctly.

49:34.999 --> 49:37.293
- The type of people who leave

49:37.393 --> 49:39.034
-and the kind who stay?
-No.

49:39.134 --> 49:41.689
That was incomplete, OK?
Don't judge me.

49:41.789 --> 49:43.734
Why don't we break out yours.

49:43.834 --> 49:46.881
Well you read mine. Why don't
you recite it for me, you creep?

49:51.015 --> 49:53.004
I don't think we can
trust anyone who says

49:53.104 --> 49:54.845
they'll know where
they'll be in five years.

50:08.424 --> 50:10.034
Will you take me to see Dean?

50:12.080 --> 50:13.547
Dean?

50:13.647 --> 50:15.083
The guy in the photos.

50:19.870 --> 50:21.002
Why?

50:24.614 --> 50:25.789
What is she gonna do

50:27.008 --> 50:28.357
when I leave in August?

50:31.795 --> 50:33.580
What is she gonna do without me?

50:35.146 --> 50:36.887
I think that she'll be alright.

50:37.975 --> 50:39.586
I'm gonna be across the country.

50:40.978 --> 50:42.371
She's gonna be all alone.

50:45.113 --> 50:49.334
We've built this weird
little life together.

50:51.859 --> 50:52.859
And...

50:56.603 --> 50:58.113
I dunno, if there's
something more for me,

50:58.213 --> 50:59.867
there has to be something
more for her.

51:03.522 --> 51:05.002
That's all I'm thinking about.

51:11.748 --> 51:12.748
OK.

51:13.881 --> 51:14.881
Yeah, let's go.

51:15.709 --> 51:18.146
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, let's go.

51:21.410 --> 51:22.454
Thank you.

52:17.074 --> 52:18.976
-Hello?
-Can I help you?

52:19.076 --> 52:20.978
Um, hi. You're Dean Hall?

52:21.078 --> 52:22.123
Yeah.

52:23.907 --> 52:25.896
This... Uh.

52:25.996 --> 52:27.637
I'm Sam, This is Ellie.

52:27.737 --> 52:29.683
Pleasure, what can I do for you?

52:29.783 --> 52:31.685
We're just...

52:31.785 --> 52:33.917
We're wanting to
furnish our new place.

52:35.353 --> 52:36.703
Your new place?

52:38.792 --> 52:41.869
It's not ours, it's for my mom.

52:41.969 --> 52:44.536
Oh, OK. Is your mom here?

52:46.364 --> 52:47.583
-No.
-No.

52:48.627 --> 52:50.138
-She's not?
-No.

52:50.238 --> 52:52.096
It's a surprise.

52:52.196 --> 52:53.968
Are you guys brother and sister?

52:54.068 --> 52:55.622
-Yeah.
-No.

52:55.722 --> 52:57.624
Kids, c'mon. I don't
have time for this.

52:57.724 --> 52:59.421
Try Living Spaces.

53:02.424 --> 53:04.034
Do you know Janice Nimitz?

53:09.953 --> 53:11.172
Yeah, I did.

53:14.001 --> 53:16.220
I knew her as Janice
Hansen back then.

53:17.221 --> 53:18.688
Yeah.

53:22.313 --> 53:23.837
I'm her son.

53:26.927 --> 53:30.713
So you wanna explain
the weird cover up...

53:31.583 --> 53:33.542
out there?

53:43.857 --> 53:45.075
Can you tell
me about that?

53:47.948 --> 53:49.253
Oh, my God.

53:53.475 --> 53:54.606
What do you want me to say?

53:55.433 --> 53:58.132
I didn't know about
you guys until now.

53:59.263 --> 54:01.788
Well it's not like it
was a secret or anything.

54:03.180 --> 54:06.040
Mom and I met at high school and

54:06.140 --> 54:07.141
dated for...

54:08.272 --> 54:09.752
a couple of years and then...

54:10.884 --> 54:12.450
eventually we got engaged.

54:13.321 --> 54:15.018
But then what?

54:17.194 --> 54:19.806
-She met your dad.
-You knew him?

54:20.719 --> 54:23.274
Yeah, he was my best friend
when I was about your age.

54:23.374 --> 54:27.409
We were in a band about the time
me and your mom got together.

54:27.509 --> 54:29.628
She left you for
your best friend?

54:29.728 --> 54:32.631
I wasn't perfect,
you know, I had my problems

54:32.731 --> 54:33.820
I was...

54:35.299 --> 54:37.519
I was a really angry kid.

54:38.868 --> 54:40.596
He was a better choice.

54:40.696 --> 54:43.730
How could you be
so cool about it? I would...

54:43.830 --> 54:45.005
I'd die.

54:46.267 --> 54:48.604
20 years is a very

54:48.704 --> 54:51.968
sobering amount of time.

54:54.710 --> 54:56.873
Why are you guys here?
So your mom had boyfriends

54:56.973 --> 54:59.062
before your dad,
I wouldn't call that uncommon.

55:02.022 --> 55:03.632
It's 'cause
she wants to see you.

55:07.592 --> 55:08.637
What?

55:10.595 --> 55:11.888
Yes.

55:11.988 --> 55:13.890
How do you think
I got the photo?

55:13.990 --> 55:15.731
She kept it, everything.

55:22.085 --> 55:23.695
Look.

55:25.436 --> 55:27.308
I really don't know what
to say about all this.

55:29.136 --> 55:30.398
Would you see her again?

55:33.053 --> 55:36.565
-I mean, I don't know.
-She's having a birthday party

55:36.665 --> 55:39.002
next week at our house.

55:39.102 --> 55:41.844
-She wouldn't wanna see me.
-I think she would.

55:43.106 --> 55:45.704
Are you sure it's OK? I was just
like: "She wants to see you."

55:45.804 --> 55:49.186
-Then I was like: "Shit."
-No. I wanted to say it myself.

55:49.286 --> 55:51.841
Yeah, I was just thinking
about what you said, it's like,

55:51.941 --> 55:54.365
she's gonna be alone. This
could be a good thing, right?

55:54.465 --> 55:55.684
Yeah, definitely.

55:57.338 --> 55:58.426
Yeah.

56:06.869 --> 56:07.914
What?

56:09.002 --> 56:10.438
You guys miss your dad.

56:20.230 --> 56:22.798
Do you remember James Keller?

56:25.453 --> 56:28.965
James Keller, the kid
with the prosthetic hand?

56:29.065 --> 56:31.663
Yes, I do.

56:31.763 --> 56:36.233
-That's an unexpected reference.
-Yeah.

56:36.333 --> 56:38.770
We had a class together
the year after his accident.

56:41.338 --> 56:45.416
He used to complain that it
hurt where his hand used to be.

56:45.516 --> 56:47.518
It's this thing called
phantom limb pain.

56:49.259 --> 56:50.682
He was supposed to
take pills for it,

56:50.782 --> 56:53.685
but he told me that he wouldn't,

56:53.785 --> 56:57.602
sometimes just because he liked
the feeling of it being there

56:57.702 --> 56:59.182
even if it hurt.

57:03.708 --> 57:06.394
It's like a part of us has gone

57:06.494 --> 57:11.760
and our only connection
to him now is the pain.

57:15.068 --> 57:18.245
Trying to move on
would mean erasing him.

57:21.988 --> 57:24.033
I dunno, it's messed up maybe.

57:25.295 --> 57:26.688
It's not messed up.

57:27.994 --> 57:29.734
I understand.

57:33.303 --> 57:34.522
What about your dad?

57:48.057 --> 57:49.841
Where are we?

57:53.671 --> 57:55.325
This is the house I grew up in.

57:58.328 --> 58:00.709
We had to give it up after
my dad left 'cause we couldn't

58:00.809 --> 58:02.289
afford the mortgage anymore.

58:05.074 --> 58:08.717
I told myself I'd come back
when I was older and buy it

58:08.817 --> 58:09.992
with my new family.

58:13.213 --> 58:14.866
I have so many memories
in this house.

58:16.868 --> 58:20.033
Before my mom was dating
a new guy every week,

58:20.133 --> 58:22.252
and I had to explain
to my brothers why

58:22.352 --> 58:24.050
I had to take care
of them and live on.

58:33.972 --> 58:35.396
My dad used to park
his station wagon

58:35.496 --> 58:37.324
over that oil stain
in the driveway.

58:41.154 --> 58:44.927
I have this memory of
Christopher, Frank and I;

58:45.027 --> 58:48.104
it was a Sunday afternoon,
my dad came home from the store

58:48.204 --> 58:49.510
and he was like, "guys...

58:51.512 --> 58:53.588
look what I found in
my basket at the store."

58:53.688 --> 58:57.070
He got out his bag and we
were just running around

58:57.170 --> 59:01.522
circling him, desperately
wanting to know what was inside.

59:10.748 --> 59:12.794
What was inside?

59:20.802 --> 59:22.108
I can't remember.

59:34.294 --> 59:36.644
Can you take me to my
appointment on Saturday?

59:39.255 --> 59:41.692
Please? I need
someone to take me.

59:43.738 --> 59:45.174
OK. Yeah.

59:46.219 --> 59:47.555
-Yeah, I'll do it.
-Really?

59:47.655 --> 59:49.874
Yeah. Terrified, but...

59:51.049 --> 59:52.442
Yeah, I'll do it.

59:54.401 --> 59:55.619
Thank you.

59:56.751 --> 59:59.057
--No, you don't.

01:00:03.192 --> 01:00:04.411
I wanna do it.

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.718
I love you, you know.

01:00:10.895 --> 01:00:12.114
Thank you.

01:00:20.209 --> 01:00:22.590
So do you just get paid
to stand here all day?

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.636
Yeah, it's for now. I'm getting
trained on register next week.

01:00:25.736 --> 01:00:27.334
Oh, nice.

01:00:27.434 --> 01:00:29.914
-Keys to the castle already.
-Bobby, I don't...

01:00:30.872 --> 01:00:32.730
It's really nice of you
to give me a ride,

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.603
but I don't want them to think
we're just hanging out here.

01:00:35.703 --> 01:00:38.519
What? No, I'm thinking 'bout
buying some previously owned

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:40.664
DVD's, as advertised.
I'm a costumer.

01:00:42.275 --> 01:00:43.872
What happened to your
girlfriend, I thought

01:00:43.972 --> 01:00:45.743
-she was giving you rides.
-She is.

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:48.181
I dunno, she took
the afternoon off.

01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:49.804
How's that going?

01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:53.199
I guess it's
getting pretty real.

01:00:54.243 --> 01:00:55.579
Oh, yeah?

01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:58.365
Alright. Gettin' out
of your shell.

01:00:58.465 --> 01:01:00.410
-Gettin' in that pipe.
-No!

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:03.544
What? Pipe?
Stop saying that. It's not...

01:01:03.644 --> 01:01:05.459
It's like, we like each other,

01:01:05.559 --> 01:01:07.822
you know. We actually like
each other, it's a real thing.

01:01:08.736 --> 01:01:10.681
Whatever blows your
hair back, man.

01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:12.392
As long as you're
out of the garage.

01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:18.689
- Alright.
- Oh, 12 o'clock.

01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:21.562
- I will see you tomorrow.
- Later.

01:01:21.662 --> 01:01:23.141
Bye.

01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:26.232
-Hey, how's it goin'?
-Hey.

01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.787
Well, DVD's are safe.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:31.528
Man's guarding it
like a junkyard dog.

01:01:31.628 --> 01:01:33.151
Were you at the beach?

01:01:37.286 --> 01:01:39.549
Yeah, my friend had
a birthday thing.

01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:46.295
Alrighty, I'm gonna go change.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:48.993
See you in there.

01:01:54.347 --> 01:01:56.249
I feel you, man.

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:57.480
So real.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.705
It's kind of funny, though.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.097
Sorry.

01:02:14.323 --> 01:02:15.542
What are you doing after work?

01:02:16.456 --> 01:02:18.936
Just watching my brothers,
nothing exciting.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.376
So...

01:02:24.377 --> 01:02:26.148
what are you guys doin'
this Friday?

01:02:26.248 --> 01:02:28.716
-What's Friday?
-Pool party.

01:02:28.816 --> 01:02:29.816
My place.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.123
Okay.

01:02:35.039 --> 01:02:37.072
Sam, you in?

01:02:37.172 --> 01:02:39.000
I can't, it's my mom's birthday.

01:02:41.394 --> 01:02:44.514
Bummer. Come after, maybe.

01:02:44.614 --> 01:02:47.213
Yeah, maybe. Are you coming

01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:49.053
to my mom's birthday?

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:52.579
It's your family thing.
I'll just see you after, OK?

01:02:55.451 --> 01:02:56.451
Yeah.

01:02:57.497 --> 01:02:59.412
Alright, let's close
it down, yeah?

01:03:00.587 --> 01:03:02.980
-Yeah.
-Can I drive you home?

01:03:04.068 --> 01:03:05.069
Yeah, sure.

01:03:14.688 --> 01:03:15.906
Wait.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.694
I don't...

01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:23.827
wanna make it
awkward, but...

01:03:25.133 --> 01:03:27.962
what's going on
with you and Zach?

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:31.966
Is that why you've
been so quiet?

01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:35.826
We've been friends for
a really long time,

01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:38.351
we dated for a little bit.

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:41.279
Didn't work out, so we're just
trying to move passed it.

01:03:44.848 --> 01:03:46.023
You understand?

01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:49.449
Yeah.

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:51.289
-Yeah.
-Don't be sad.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:53.901
I'm not.

01:03:56.904 --> 01:03:57.948
OK.

01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:56.311
Surprise!

01:04:57.878 --> 01:04:59.923
Oh, you're such troubles.

01:05:04.537 --> 01:05:05.668
Hi.

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:32.813
You missed the surprise, but...

01:05:32.913 --> 01:05:34.349
Yeah, sorry.

01:05:35.393 --> 01:05:37.121
I sat in the car for

01:05:37.221 --> 01:05:39.223
about 30 minutes before
I tuned on the engine.

01:05:42.357 --> 01:05:44.228
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:46.796
No, I know. I do.

01:05:48.885 --> 01:05:54.748
I do. OK.

01:05:54.848 --> 01:05:57.054
I just can't believe
you all drove in.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.360
Mom.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.853
Someone's here to see you.

01:06:01.115 --> 01:06:02.595
Hey, Janice.

01:06:06.642 --> 01:06:10.516
Peggy, Allen, nice to see
you guys, it's been a while.

01:06:11.865 --> 01:06:14.389
I'm sorry, I just don't...

01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:17.087
I don't und..

01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:24.660
I'm sorry, can you
just give me a second?

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.055
Excuse me.

01:06:29.273 --> 01:06:30.318
One sec.

01:06:38.587 --> 01:06:39.675
Hey, mom?

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.157
Can you open the door, please?

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:47.030
I was just trying to...

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.196
What have you done?
What are you doing?

01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:54.155
I'm trying to help you.

01:06:54.255 --> 01:06:56.431
You're trying to
help me do what?

01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:00.261
I saw all those letters and
the photos between you and Dean.

01:07:01.262 --> 01:07:02.685
I saw how in love you guys were.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.557
Oh, my God, Sam.

01:07:04.657 --> 01:07:09.475
That was 20 years ago. 20!

01:07:09.575 --> 01:07:11.651
What are you thinking?

01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:14.218
What gives you any right
to go through my life?

01:07:14.318 --> 01:07:16.569
I'm sorry.

01:07:16.669 --> 01:07:17.918
OK?

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:19.541
I do not need your help.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.893
I don't need to be saved by
anybody, let alone my own kid.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.796
You are the child,
I am the parent,

01:07:26.896 --> 01:07:29.507
-stop forgetting that.
-Then act like one!

01:07:31.988 --> 01:07:35.035
You can't just quit your life
because something bad happened.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.287
I already lost my dad, I don't
need to lose my mom too.

01:07:39.387 --> 01:07:41.563
-You're not losing me.
-I already have.

01:07:42.956 --> 01:07:44.510
All day, every day,

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:46.860
all you do is sleep
on that couch.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.875
You never talk to me.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.561
You made me move
into dad's studio,

01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:54.184
so you wouldn't have to see me.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.653
-I did not make you.
-You sure as hell made

01:07:57.753 --> 01:07:58.915
a good argument for it.

01:07:59.015 --> 01:08:01.614
And you never come to see me.

01:08:01.714 --> 01:08:03.616
You just threw me in there
with all of his other stuff

01:08:03.716 --> 01:08:06.675
you don't wanna see. Now I'm
alone with it all the time.

01:08:13.595 --> 01:08:15.453
I didn't know
you felt like this.

01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:16.903
Of course I do.

01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:20.109
You practically just
waiting for me

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:21.734
to leave for school next month.

01:08:22.778 --> 01:08:25.433
I just remind you of him
and now you want me gone too.

01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:42.232
I'm sorry.

01:09:20.662 --> 01:09:21.794
Sam!

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:26.189
Yeah, I'm glad you could
make it, man. C'mon.

01:09:28.148 --> 01:09:29.236
Hey, J.D.

01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:32.269
-Have you seen Ellie?
-Ellie, yeah.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.589
I think... Hey, man.
Uh, Ellie, yeah.

01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:36.718
She's around here somewhere.
She's with Zach.

01:09:36.818 --> 01:09:38.593
Why don't you try the pool, man.
Good luck.

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:46.862
- Yeah.
- C'mon.

01:09:59.919 --> 01:10:01.995
Your turn. Up. Go!

01:10:02.095 --> 01:10:03.749
No, you go.

01:10:18.285 --> 01:10:20.535
-Sam, stop.
-What do you want from me?

01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:22.232
Just talk to me, please. Sam!

01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:23.843
-No, shut up.
-What?

01:10:23.943 --> 01:10:25.640
Shut up!

01:10:27.685 --> 01:10:28.904
You told me...

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.156
-that you were just friends.
-We are just friends!

01:10:33.256 --> 01:10:35.811
You don't act like that
with your ex-boyfriend

01:10:35.911 --> 01:10:38.684
when you're starting a
relationship with somebody new.

01:10:38.784 --> 01:10:41.208
Back off, OK. I didn't know
this was a relationship.

01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:44.180
Are you...? No!
Are you kidding me?

01:10:46.922 --> 01:10:49.564
Not everything has to be
one way or the other, right?

01:10:49.664 --> 01:10:51.971
Must be easy living like that.

01:10:55.713 --> 01:10:57.150
I think you might be right,

01:10:58.238 --> 01:11:00.980
we might just all end up
like our parents.

01:11:05.854 --> 01:11:08.714
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Go ahead and have that baby,

01:11:08.814 --> 01:11:10.250
get on with it.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.821
I let you into my life,
Sam, and then...

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.606
You're just gonnause it against me?

01:11:19.563 --> 01:11:22.771
Yeah. Doesn't feel good to
have people you trust

01:11:22.871 --> 01:11:24.686
be reckless with you, does it?

01:11:24.786 --> 01:11:26.396
I'm sorry, OK?

01:11:29.182 --> 01:11:31.127
God, give me a break!

01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:33.782
Haven't you ever been
unsure about anything?

01:11:33.882 --> 01:11:34.882
No.

01:11:35.928 --> 01:11:37.712
Not when it comes to you.

01:11:40.236 --> 01:11:42.238
God, stop looking at me like that!

01:11:45.546 --> 01:11:47.535
Just 'cause you liked me all
these years doesn't mean

01:11:47.635 --> 01:11:49.363
I have to be your fantasy.

01:11:49.463 --> 01:11:52.105
No, it's not about that.

01:11:52.205 --> 01:11:53.510
Then what?

01:11:57.036 --> 01:11:58.341
I thought we were in it together.

01:12:19.319 --> 01:12:20.973
Don't you think it's weird
that we drive?

01:12:23.236 --> 01:12:25.007
And like we're...

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:26.107
monkeys.

01:12:27.283 --> 01:12:29.242
OK. So like, imagine Lucy driving a car.

01:12:32.027 --> 01:12:33.550
Who is Lucy?

01:12:34.682 --> 01:12:35.901
Did I...?

01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:39.195
I can't...

01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:41.950
I think you've had
enough of this.

01:12:44.779 --> 01:12:45.954
Hey, there's Sam.

01:12:47.651 --> 01:12:49.249
-Sam.
-My man, Sam arrived.

01:12:49.349 --> 01:12:51.729
-Yo, Sam. What are you doin'?
-Sam.

01:12:51.829 --> 01:12:53.340
- I'm going home.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.658
Come here real quick.

01:12:55.529 --> 01:12:56.747
What's going on, man?

01:12:57.792 --> 01:12:59.098
What's up?

01:13:00.099 --> 01:13:02.262
Trouble in paradise
with Ellie Vaughn?

01:13:02.362 --> 01:13:03.872
Now you join the army
of other young men

01:13:03.972 --> 01:13:05.395
who have been burned
by miss Vaughn.

01:13:05.495 --> 01:13:07.006
You guys should
start a scholarship.

01:13:07.106 --> 01:13:08.746
On the bright side
you're back on the horse.

01:13:08.846 --> 01:13:10.618
Get off me!

01:13:10.718 --> 01:13:13.577
Hey, man. Don't be killin'
the fuckin' vibe like that.

01:13:13.677 --> 01:13:16.406
Killing the vibe,
Samming the mood,

01:13:16.506 --> 01:13:18.278
-aren't I?
-Yeah.

01:13:18.378 --> 01:13:20.149
As a matter of fact
you were Samming the mood.

01:13:20.249 --> 01:13:22.064
I'm really sorry that
my dad killing himself

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.166
has been cramping
you style so much.

01:13:25.254 --> 01:13:26.254
What?

01:13:29.215 --> 01:13:31.421
Alright, dude,
I'm too high for this.

01:13:31.521 --> 01:13:34.598
You're always high, drunk,
trying to sleep with some girl.

01:13:34.698 --> 01:13:36.613
Don't you care
about anything else?

01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:42.968
Please stop pretending
we're friends.

01:13:50.584 --> 01:13:52.673
Alright, come here, dude.
I don't know what's goin' on.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:00.636
You know...

01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:02.975
For the past year
I've been trying

01:14:03.075 --> 01:14:04.163
to get you out
of this house.

01:14:05.468 --> 01:14:07.544
No, you just wanna
stay cuddled up

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:09.603
on your little island
in your garage, don't you?

01:14:12.606 --> 01:14:15.000
It's just me pretending
to be your friend, right?

01:14:17.132 --> 01:14:19.905
What about our band
you just totally bailed.

01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:21.950
I didn't
think Poetic Demise

01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:24.661
was gonna make any
real waves! Can you stop?

01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:28.478
-It was ours, though.
-I know.

01:14:28.578 --> 01:14:30.872
Look this shit was hard
on all of us.

01:14:30.972 --> 01:14:33.919
OK? Everybody misses your dad.

01:14:34.019 --> 01:14:36.499
Me, you, your mom. Everybody
who knew the guy, misses him.

01:14:39.328 --> 01:14:40.808
I knew him since
I was a little kid!

01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:43.754
He was the only person
that believed in my music.

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:44.899
The only person!

01:14:46.335 --> 01:14:48.020
My parents are sending me to
math camp and shit like,

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.295
who the fuck does that?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600
So...

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.042
Just take the fuckin' chip
off your shoulder, man.

01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:26.797
Yeah.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.639
Order number seven...

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:32.947
zero, one, zero,
zero, zero, one.

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.676
Yeah.

01:15:35.776 --> 01:15:38.418
Hey, can I call you back?

01:15:38.518 --> 01:15:40.607
Alright, yeah. Bye.

01:15:47.527 --> 01:15:48.919
You wanna come in?

01:15:52.097 --> 01:15:54.664
You're not gonna run my hand
through the band saw, are you?

01:15:58.190 --> 01:15:59.278
C'mon. C'mere.

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:07.329
I'm...

01:16:08.374 --> 01:16:09.766
so, sorry.

01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:14.031
It's alright.

01:16:16.599 --> 01:16:18.688
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:21.387
Are you not pissed at me?

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:25.913
I was.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.575
I get it.

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.578
You're a good kid, you just...

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.842
did somethin' stupid.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.064
I just...

01:16:48.936 --> 01:16:50.155
I can't...

01:16:51.678 --> 01:16:53.188
handle

01:16:53.288 --> 01:16:54.855
the kind of people who leave.

01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:59.425
Now with the going
to school, my...

01:17:01.253 --> 01:17:04.025
And in doing that, I am that.

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:06.171
People who leave,
people who stay, man.

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:09.900
I haven't heard that in a long
time. Let me tell you something,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.785
it's easy to draw lines
in the sand.

01:17:13.308 --> 01:17:16.398
But trust me,
people don't exist...

01:17:17.617 --> 01:17:19.706
on one side or the other.

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.450
You don't have to listen
to me, but I think you should.

01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:26.843
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:17:28.584 --> 01:17:30.934
All this bullshit...

01:17:32.284 --> 01:17:34.024
doesn't have to define you.

01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:38.515
OK? That's what you
need to control.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.423
How do you control it?

01:17:44.557 --> 01:17:45.557
This...

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.909
is where I feel in control.

01:17:52.217 --> 01:17:54.249
I dunno, isn't it all kind of tedious?

01:17:54.349 --> 01:17:55.959
Sometimes it is.

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:58.048
But you know,

01:17:58.919 --> 01:18:01.213
I get to beat
the shit out of wood and

01:18:01.313 --> 01:18:02.618
metal all day.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.869
And over time

01:18:05.969 --> 01:18:07.232
make something beautiful.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.458
See?

01:18:22.116 --> 01:18:24.018
You don't have any
dead bodies, right?

01:18:24.118 --> 01:18:26.512
Yeah,
they're in the freezer.

01:18:27.774 --> 01:18:29.254
Wanna give it a shot?

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:32.387
-Yeah.
-Yup.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.652
Look at that, it's easy.

01:18:51.363 --> 01:18:53.569
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

01:18:54.069 --> 01:18:55.167
Alright.

01:18:55.367 --> 01:18:57.207
What do you say,
you wanna build somethin'?

01:18:59.066 --> 01:19:00.920
-Yeah.
-What are you thinkin'?

01:19:02.548 --> 01:19:04.276
Kitchen table?

01:19:04.376 --> 01:19:05.855
Coffee table?

01:19:09.642 --> 01:19:11.687
Actually, I think
I got something.

01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:16.736
Eleanor Vaughn?

01:19:19.869 --> 01:19:21.784
Please put this on for us.

01:19:22.872 --> 01:19:24.309
And the doctor will be right in.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.121
Welcome back.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.033
Let's do four,

01:20:06.133 --> 01:20:07.613
-so what we'd get out is four.
-Yeah.

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:10.659
3, 12, 16.

01:20:11.530 --> 01:20:15.129
OK, 'cause we're gonna turn it
into squares, right?

01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:17.100
Yeah.

01:20:40.559 --> 01:20:41.777
Hey.

01:20:43.997 --> 01:20:46.029
Tomorrow your last day?

01:20:46.129 --> 01:20:47.129
Yeah.

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:50.960
When do you leave for Rochester?

01:20:51.918 --> 01:20:53.136
Three days.

01:20:59.099 --> 01:21:00.317
Can I give you a ride home?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.153
Can I drive us somewhere?

01:21:11.546 --> 01:21:14.070
-What?
-I wanted to drive us somewhere.

01:21:16.769 --> 01:21:18.379
What about your license?

01:21:20.425 --> 01:21:22.688
I don't know.

01:21:39.922 --> 01:21:41.781
How do you turn on
your brights?

01:21:41.881 --> 01:21:42.882
Oh, here.

01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:51.791
So, are you gonna tell me why

01:21:51.891 --> 01:21:53.414
you took me to the middle of nowhere?

01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:30.233
Sam?

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:32.932
This is where he did it.

01:22:34.237 --> 01:22:35.500
Hey, come here.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.099
I tried to come

01:22:39.199 --> 01:22:40.853
before, I just wanted to see it.

01:22:46.206 --> 01:22:47.381
The police said...

01:22:49.644 --> 01:22:52.429
The police said that
they didn't find anything.

01:22:55.607 --> 01:22:57.217
Just his truck and a gun.

01:23:01.134 --> 01:23:02.178
You know...

01:23:05.965 --> 01:23:07.444
Is that when you crashed his truck?

01:23:08.489 --> 01:23:09.925
It's a stick shift.

01:23:10.839 --> 01:23:13.873
I didn't get in very many lessons,
so I was obviously

01:23:13.973 --> 01:23:15.540
not very good.

01:23:17.454 --> 01:23:19.065
I don't know,
it got stuck in third.

01:23:20.849 --> 01:23:22.372
I lost control. I dunno.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.164
It didn't feel right to leave
this place without seeing it.

01:23:35.864 --> 01:23:37.213
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.435
-You don't have to be sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

01:23:44.003 --> 01:23:45.613
I'm sorry about your dad.

01:23:46.919 --> 01:23:48.485
And I'm sorry about the party.

01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:50.779
And I'm sorry for everything.

01:23:50.879 --> 01:23:52.968
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

01:23:54.013 --> 01:23:56.089
No, listen. OK, we got close.

01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:58.831
We got closer than
I've ever been

01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:00.454
with anyone in my whole life.

01:24:02.021 --> 01:24:03.109
And...

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:06.578
I let my relationship with Zach

01:24:06.678 --> 01:24:08.114
bleed into ours,
and that's not fair.

01:24:10.986 --> 01:24:12.727
I didn't mean what
I said about...

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.369
you ending up like your mom.

01:24:15.469 --> 01:24:16.601
I don't think that.

01:24:22.128 --> 01:24:23.608
I wish we could've
met down the road.

01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:26.349
When we were like 27

01:24:27.307 --> 01:24:28.874
and we have everything
all figured out.

01:24:31.528 --> 01:24:33.356
I think we needed
each other now.

01:24:36.925 --> 01:24:38.187
I hate that you're leaving.

01:24:39.798 --> 01:24:42.439
Maybe we'll try again
when we're 27.

01:24:42.539 --> 01:24:44.367
OK.

01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:50.678
I like that. You'll be some
like...

01:24:51.766 --> 01:24:54.016
world-class composer

01:24:54.116 --> 01:24:55.596
and I'll be like this...

01:25:00.645 --> 01:25:01.937
That's T.B.D,

01:25:02.037 --> 01:25:04.636
but it will also be great

01:25:04.736 --> 01:25:05.954
and world-class.

01:25:09.741 --> 01:25:11.338
It's a great plan.

01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:12.569
Yeah.

01:25:15.398 --> 01:25:16.398
OK.

01:25:17.749 --> 01:25:19.054
So nine years.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.058
I'm gonna be waiting.

01:25:26.018 --> 01:25:27.497
Just tell me you will too.

01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:34.113
I will.

01:25:47.039 --> 01:25:49.158
Sad to see you go.

01:25:49.258 --> 01:25:50.912
You know what this
means, though, right?

01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:35.261
The truth is people are much
more complicated than that.

01:26:40.832 --> 01:26:43.660
They don't exist
on one side or the other.

01:26:47.534 --> 01:26:50.755
You have to let them in just as often
as you let them leave.

01:27:03.289 --> 01:27:05.770
Bye, guys. Bye,
I'll be back later, OK?

01:27:21.263 --> 01:27:24.471
It's the phantom limb pain
that we carry with us

01:27:24.571 --> 01:27:26.138
even after people leave.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:33.580
And that's OK because
it's ours to share.

01:28:02.696 --> 01:28:04.293
Alright, here's what I was

01:28:04.393 --> 01:28:06.078
thinking for the intro track,

01:28:06.178 --> 01:28:08.689
it's kind of rough, but
I feel like it captures

01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:10.865
that raw mood we
were talking about.

01:28:10.965 --> 01:28:13.694
This may not
be a five year plan per se,

01:28:13.794 --> 01:28:16.101
but who really knows.

01:28:17.406 --> 01:28:20.670
We're all just doing the best we can
and if that's good enough...

01:28:24.892 --> 01:28:25.980
It has to be.

01:28:27.764 --> 01:28:28.983
Hey.

01:28:51.527 --> 01:28:52.528
Thank you.

01:28:54.139 --> 01:28:56.041
Love what you've done
with the place.

01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:57.490
Thank you.

01:29:05.498 --> 01:29:07.892
I know you've been
spending time with Dean.

01:29:10.895 --> 01:29:12.884
He called me
and asked if it was OK.

01:29:12.984 --> 01:29:14.289
Is it?

01:29:18.903 --> 01:29:20.121
Dean's a good guy.

01:29:22.994 --> 01:29:25.518
He did not deserve what
your dad and I did to him.

01:29:32.307 --> 01:29:33.352
I have a question.

01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:39.227
Looking back...

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:45.755
Do you still think
you made the right choice?

01:29:57.245 --> 01:29:58.812
I loved your father.

01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.339
I mean, I loved your dad.

01:30:07.995 --> 01:30:10.680
And I know you've tried
really hard to understand

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.347
why he did what he did.

01:30:16.656 --> 01:30:17.831
It's...

01:30:19.659 --> 01:30:21.356
It's so hard to accept that...

01:30:25.056 --> 01:30:26.492
Sometimes people are just...

01:30:27.623 --> 01:30:29.177
sick.

01:30:29.277 --> 01:30:31.410
I mean, that's it, you know.

01:30:36.981 --> 01:30:38.504
Nothing more to it than that.

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:43.496
At least that's what
I've spent the last year

01:30:43.596 --> 01:30:45.511
trying to convince myself of.

01:30:51.386 --> 01:30:53.475
And I know you think
I'm a hopeless shut-in.

01:30:56.565 --> 01:30:58.567
You are not wrong, it's true.

01:31:02.093 --> 01:31:05.009
I know I haven't made a lot of
attempts at normal since...

01:31:07.489 --> 01:31:08.751
Well.

01:31:12.103 --> 01:31:14.135
A couple of months

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:15.976
before it happened...

01:31:18.805 --> 01:31:21.242
we got into
a really bad fight.

01:31:25.594 --> 01:31:28.989
I was just so sick of him making
me suffer with him, you know?

01:31:32.688 --> 01:31:33.950
And...

01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:37.389
He asked me

01:31:38.477 --> 01:31:40.914
if I regretted
choosing him over Dean.

01:31:45.353 --> 01:31:46.833
And...

01:31:49.923 --> 01:31:52.708
I just didn't answer,
I just didn't say anything.

01:31:57.409 --> 01:32:00.020
I just let him sit in it,
you know, just let him wonder.

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:06.200
Mom.

01:32:13.773 --> 01:32:16.167
Then a few months later
he did what he did.

01:32:18.212 --> 01:32:20.462
I really need you to
forgive me for that

01:32:20.562 --> 01:32:23.043
because I can't
forgive myself, Sam.

01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:35.925
It's OK that we
don't have all the answers.

01:32:59.775 --> 01:33:01.299
My God, you're leaving.

01:33:06.478 --> 01:33:09.089
I've been hiding from you,
I've wasted so much time.

01:33:12.701 --> 01:33:14.964
We've just been hiding
from each other.

01:33:26.759 --> 01:33:28.252
Can I show you something?

01:33:31.285 --> 01:33:32.492
Please.

01:33:56.049 --> 01:33:57.268
OK.
