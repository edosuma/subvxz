02:41.995 --> 02:44.371
- You know, I'm not really sure
I even want to do this,

02:44.497 --> 02:47.708
but this couple
down at the precinct,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.377
they been at me for this
for a year now.

02:50.503 --> 02:54.131
We've known 'em for 15 years,
I mean, Don and Jan Connolly.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.883
They're real good people,
but, you know,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.844
but they can't have kids,
so he goes, you know,

02:58.970 --> 03:01.305
"If I had a child, I would
want him to be like Hollis."

03:01.431 --> 03:02.723
Shoot, I ain't even told
my wife.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.225
- Mr. Lucetti.
Mr. Lucetti.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.978
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.147
This ain't my normal routine,
you know,

03:10.273 --> 03:12.399
in a jar before breakfast.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.984
- Hollis.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.320
- Yes, Doc?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.031
- This woman is not going
to be having your baby.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.244
- Why?

03:26.956 --> 03:30.709
- You have a birth defect.

03:32.921 --> 03:37.966
- You mean I'm infertile?
Sterile?

03:38.092 --> 03:41.220
- Everything else functions,
but...

03:47.727 --> 03:49.728
- Have I always been infertile?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.983
- Yes.
I'm afraid so.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.858
- We got a jumper.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.568
He's on the roof
at the Tamlacker Building.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.697
- Look, I'm not feeling
so well today.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.782
- Well, I'll get Partridge in
to relieve you.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.908
Let's go.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.377
- Please stay behind
the barricade, ma'am.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.949
- Hey, how you doing?
I'm Hollis.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.620
- You a cop?

06:11.746 --> 06:14.247
- Yes, but it's okay.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.459
You can call me Hollis
or Holly.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.087
Some of my friends
call me Holly.

06:22.006 --> 06:25.425
- Is this your specialty,
Hollis?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.511
- Well, I'm a detective
in this precinct,

06:27.637 --> 06:29.012
and I do other work,

06:29.138 --> 06:31.098
but I take care
of this kind of thing too.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.808
- What's your success rate?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.604
- It's decent.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.439
Tell me,
what's your name?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.154
- Gavin.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.323
- Are you married, Gavin?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.285
- No.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.413
- Then what in the hell
are you doing up here?

06:57.625 --> 07:01.002
- That was a joke?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.921
- It was an attempt at a joke.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.844
- Well, you're married,
obviously.

07:11.097 --> 07:15.976
- Listen, I'm trained to talk
to you for hours on end,

07:16.102 --> 07:19.271
and I'll go around and around
in circles until you're so dizzy

07:19.397 --> 07:21.523
that you fall off of here,

07:21.649 --> 07:25.193
but my gut tells me that you're
too smart for the standard bull,

07:25.319 --> 07:27.195
so why don't we
just cut right to it

07:27.321 --> 07:30.740
and you tell me
what's your problem?

07:30.867 --> 07:34.453
- No, I think I'd like to go
around in circles for a while.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.664
- Okay.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.005
- So how long you been together,
you and your wife?

07:45.131 --> 07:47.507
- 15 years.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.677
- Is the sex still good?

07:50.803 --> 07:52.971
- Do we have to talk
about this, Gavin?

07:53.097 --> 07:55.015
- No.
I could jump.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.433
- Yeah, well, from way up here,

07:56.559 --> 07:59.019
there's nothing we can put down
that's gonna save you.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.146
You know that, right?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.111
- So is it still good?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.075
- Better than when we first met.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.077
- Isn't it usually
the other way around?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.997
I mean, isn't that the way
it's supposed to go?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.375
- Yeah, a lot of things
that are supposed to go one way

08:22.502 --> 08:24.544
end up going the other.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.796
That's one of the things
you learn in my job.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.677
- You been faithful?

08:32.803 --> 08:35.639
- Yes.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.890
But on the subject of faith...

08:39.434 --> 08:40.602
Do you have any?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.399
- Do you?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.776
- Yes.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.069
I'm Catholic.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.533
So no faith, huh?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.373
You got you a girlfriend?

09:06.170 --> 09:07.629
- Not exactly.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.256
- I understand.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.966
You one of them gay guys, huh?

09:13.719 --> 09:16.179
- No.

09:16.305 --> 09:19.349
Although I do live with one.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.684
He got kicked out of his job

09:20.810 --> 09:24.312
when they found out
he was HIV-positive.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.439
I took him in,
helped him get a newjob.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.941
And now he's-
- Gavin!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.651
Hey!

09:29.777 --> 09:32.320
What are you doing?

09:32.446 --> 09:33.738
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Gavin!

09:33.864 --> 09:35.407
Gavin, stop for a second, man.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.575
- What are you doing?

09:36.701 --> 09:37.701
- Gavin.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.124
- Fuck me.
Why is this so hard?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.961
- You don't have to do this,
you know.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.671
You really don't.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.256
- No, actually, I do.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.011
And when I'm gone,

09:56.137 --> 10:00.056
you're gonna have to take care
of something for me, okay?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.766
- I won't do it.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.144
If you got something
that you need to handle,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.021
I suggest you climb in here

10:06.147 --> 10:07.606
and you take care of it
yourself.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.358
- I can't.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.281
- You're not up here by choice,
are you?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.453
- No.

10:28.669 --> 10:33.340
I have to stay up here
until noon

10:33.466 --> 10:34.507
and then jump.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.512
If I don't,
someone else is gonna die.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.722
- Why?

10:57.698 --> 10:58.823
- Mornin'.
- How's it goin'?

10:58.949 --> 10:59.949
- Good.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.927
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, guys.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.978
Oh, please, come on in.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.231
- You used to be a teacher,
right?

12:13.357 --> 12:14.274
- Yeah.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.817
- So I'm in
this art history class,

12:15.943 --> 12:17.235
and we're studying
religious art,

12:17.361 --> 12:20.155
and my assignment this week
is to write about an object

12:20.281 --> 12:23.241
that's sacred to me to which
I have an emotional attachment,

12:23.367 --> 12:24.951
and I need your advice.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.619
- Okay.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.206
- I found this
in one of the rooms,

12:30.332 --> 12:32.041
and I'm thinking, tonight,

12:32.168 --> 12:34.335
I'm gonna have
a religious experience.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.631
- So your question is,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.508
"Does having
a religious experience

12:40.634 --> 12:43.178
"with this
intimidatingly large dildo

12:43.304 --> 12:46.473
transform it
into a sacred object?"

12:46.599 --> 12:48.141
- You're so smart, Gavin.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.895
- Well, it's highly
questionable.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.271
Maybe the real question
here is,

12:53.397 --> 12:56.775
"Is your attachment to this
going to be emotional?"

12:56.901 --> 12:59.736
- Oh, my emotions
get aroused pretty easily.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.654
- I'll bet they do.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.866
- Although looking at Buzz here
and then looking at you,

13:04.992 --> 13:07.494
I can't help but think
"three-way."

13:07.620 --> 13:10.538
- Jesus Christ.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.166
I always enjoy
talking to you, Harper,

13:13.292 --> 13:15.251
but you're gonna get me fired.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.711
- Come on,
I'm just flirting with you.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.087
- It's a slippery slope.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.423
- How would you know?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.841
- Good one.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.510
Haven't you got some work to do?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.220
- Oh.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.387
Oh. This is Shana Harris.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.306
She's in
the art history class too.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.142
Looking for a job,
so be nice to her.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.311
But not too nice.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.858
- I didn't realize
you worked here.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.485
- No, I don't work very hard.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.364
- Does that make it
less of a coincidence?

13:44.490 --> 13:45.824
- I'm Gavin.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.409
Assistant manager.
Please have a seat.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.037
You live with that guy?

13:51.163 --> 13:53.540
- Yeah. We only just moved in.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.458
- How do you like it?

13:55.584 --> 13:56.709
- I like it.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.879
My husband's not so sure.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.465
- What's your major?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.384
- Accounting.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.969
- Ah.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.137
- I always thought
I'd do something in music.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.722
I took lessons as a kid.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.934
But got to earn a living,
you know?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.853
- People don't earn a living
with music?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.401
- I'm just looking
for a part-time job

14:21.527 --> 14:22.735
to help with tuition.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.822
I'm a serious person,
and I'm very hardworking.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.907
I could do anything.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.826
- What do you play?

14:31.328 --> 14:33.454
- I play piano,
but we don't have one right now,

14:33.581 --> 14:36.916
so I'm actually learning guitar.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.668
- Cool.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.837
Well, start when you want.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.005
- Really?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.299
- Hey, it's not my hotel.
What do I care?

14:46.343 --> 14:49.387
- Thank you.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.265
- So I see this very pretty girl
comin' out of 213.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.434
- Yeah. Shana.
Married.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.768
- Right, Shana.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.478
How'd you know that?

14:57.605 --> 14:59.772
- Little early for whiskey,
don't you think?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.566
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.651
- I've spoken with her
a couple times in the hallway.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.111
They just moved in.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.697
- Anyhow, I see her
saying good-bye to the guy,

15:07.823 --> 15:08.698
the husband.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.866
- Yeah?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.284
- Next thing I know,
she's on the bus.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.411
Then she's at the hotel,
wanting a job.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.830
- I suppose you think that's all
just coincidence, right?

15:15.956 --> 15:19.250
- Well, yeah, Chris.
Why else would I be telling you?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.169
What else would it be?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.588
- Why can't you just accept
that things have meaning, Gavin?

15:23.714 --> 15:25.715
-Meaning.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.592
What possible meaning
could that have?

15:27.718 --> 15:28.968
- Connections.
Destiny.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.596
- She's married.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.056
Where's the destiny in that?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.891
- Why do you always
have to be so rational?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.684
- Why is it wrong
to be rational?

15:36.810 --> 15:40.063
- Okay, we're gonna get
into a fight.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.398
- So how was your week?

15:42.524 --> 15:45.985
- Full of light.
- Fuck off.

15:49.823 --> 15:50.698
Both:
Hi.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.866
- Hey.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.826
- My wife tells me
you're her new boss.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.994
- Yeah.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.871
Well, sort of.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.581
- I'm Joe Harris.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.749
How's it goin'?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.042
- Gavin.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.168
This is Chris.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.544
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.672
Both:
Hi.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.673
- How are you, Shana?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.924
- I'm good, thank you.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.260
- You guys want to come in
for a beer, sandwich?

16:11.387 --> 16:13.680
- Uh, no, thank you.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.515
Actually, we wanted
to invite you guys

16:15.641 --> 16:16.683
over for dinner
some night.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.518
- Great.
Any night but Fridays.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.228
- How about Wednesday?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.605
- Good.
- Sure. Why not?

16:22.731 --> 16:23.731
Can you email directions?

16:27.361 --> 16:28.486
- 7:00?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.031
- Fine.
Lookin' forward to it.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.325
- Great.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.995
- Bye.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.084
Front desk: Landon.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.210
How's it goin', Landon?

16:44.336 --> 16:45.712
- Fine, sir.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.047
- The geniuses at head office
want to get rid of him,

16:48.173 --> 16:49.590
project a younger image.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.343
I tell 'em
he goes, I go.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.720
Reservations: Selena,

16:53.846 --> 16:55.763
the most inhospitable
reservationist

16:55.889 --> 16:58.057
in the hospitality industry.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.352
Probably responsible for 50%
of the empty rooms in the hotel.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.437
Right, Selena?

17:02.563 --> 17:03.938
- Hi, Papi.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.566
- Don't call me Papi.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.733
Head of security.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.281
We all feel much safer
knowing he's asleep in here.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.075
So I don't have any room service
slots available yet,

17:16.201 --> 17:17.952
but you can do
some housekeeping shifts,

17:18.078 --> 17:19.746
and then I'll switch you over.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.329
I'll assign you your own floor.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.874
That way, I can tell
from the complaints

17:23.000 --> 17:25.251
if it's you
who's screwing things up.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.296
Consuela, this is Shana.
- Hi.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.339
- Show her how to do
a housekeeping shift, okay?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.425
- Sure.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.927
- Show a little respect.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.512
I'll see you later.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.432
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.768
- Hi, guys.
Come on in.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.519
- Thanks.
How's it goin'?

17:43.645 --> 17:44.937
- Good. How are you?
- Gavin.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.773
- Hey.
- Chris, how are you?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.357
- Hi.
This is lovely.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.400
- Thank you.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.443
- Here.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.444
- Oh, thank you.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.487
- Yeah, you're welcome.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.529
- Thank you for the gift.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.448
- We need this.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.950
- Please sit down.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.411
Would you like
a glass of wine?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.330
- Sure, thanks.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.664
- Shana.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.585
- I could do that if you like.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.177
- Thank you for having us over.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.303
That's very nice of you.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.304
- Our pleasure.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.514
- Thanks.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.973
Is that yours?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.350
- Oh, yeah.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.229
But I wore out the strings.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.189
- How's school going?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.566
- It's okay.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.486
- You doing that same essay
as Harper, sacred object?

18:33.612 --> 18:34.946
- Yeah.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.948
- So what's your sacred object
gonna be?

18:37.074 --> 18:39.826
- Um, a teddy bear.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.662
- Wow, that's pretty radical,
Shana.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.664
Harper's going
in a whole different direction-

18:44.790 --> 18:47.792
- It's more complicated
than you think.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.293
It's a good essay.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.630
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.054
- Maybe you could critique it.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.597
You're good at that, right?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.936
- So who else
is gonna get lubed?

19:07.062 --> 19:08.020
- We don't drink.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.188
- Oh.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.399
- But please, feel free.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.525
Chris?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.861
- Uh, no, thanks.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.279
I'll take a water, though.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.573
- Glass of water, Shana.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.584
- So what do you do, Joe?

19:29.710 --> 19:31.627
- I work at the oil refinery.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.255
I'm a systems manager.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.298
And you?

19:35.424 --> 19:38.718
- I'm in TV.
I'm an editor.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.386
Yeah, right now,
I'm working on a show

19:40.512 --> 19:42.054
about the long-term
psychological effects

19:42.181 --> 19:43.598
of disaster.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.099
- Okay.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.809
- Oh.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.232
- So you guys want to watch
the game here tonight?

19:53.358 --> 19:55.568
- Oh, no,
thank you.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.403
- No?
You don't like baseball?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.907
- It's okay, I guess.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.825
- Chris?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.619
- Well, yeah, sure.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.246
Maybe a couple innings.
Why not?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.916
- How long have you two
been friends?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.083
- About a year.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.420
- Yeah, we're coming up
on our first anniversary.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.464
- That's right.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.096
- Would you mind
if we prayed for you both?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.306
- No.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.770
- Lord, thank you
for this wonderful meal,

20:30.896 --> 20:33.856
and thank you for bringing
these two men into our lives.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.983
And please grant them
the strength to fight

20:36.109 --> 20:37.568
what is abominable in your eyes,

20:37.694 --> 20:38.611
for we are all sinners.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.571
Amen.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.531
- Amen.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.495
And what exactly is it

20:47.621 --> 20:51.457
that you find so abominable
about us, Joe?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.125
- Well, it's not my judgment,
Gavin.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.961
It's God's.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.255
- Well, I hope God's a good shot
with those lightning bolts,

20:57.381 --> 21:00.132
or one of us is gonna get
wrongfully struck.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.683
Well, thank you for dinner.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.235
- He has very strong beliefs.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.945
- So do we, Chris.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.740
You know, there are programs
that can help you.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.659
- Joe.
- I can-

21:26.785 --> 21:28.160
- That's enough.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.328
- Hey, you know what?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.329
Honestly, Joe,

21:30.455 --> 21:31.664
I think if you knew
all the facts,

21:31.790 --> 21:35.001
you wouldn't want me
on your team.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.712
Okay?

21:37.838 --> 21:38.838
Thank you.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.590
- Let me show you out.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.551
- Well, we're here
if you change your mind.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.682
- I'm sorry.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.734
- Un-fucking-believable.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.861
I mean,
what a hateful fucking pair.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.031
The food wasn't even that good.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.658
And you know what pisses me off
most of all?

22:07.784 --> 22:10.286
Is that you buy into
his horse shit in your own way.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.538
- They don't talk about that
stuff at the Kabbalah center.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.664
It's never an issue.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.541
- Oh, read the damn book, Chris.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.876
It says right in the Torah,

22:17.002 --> 22:19.462
"If a man lies with a man
as one lies with a woman,

22:19.588 --> 22:21.130
"both have done
what is detestable

22:21.256 --> 22:23.799
and shall be put to death."

22:23.925 --> 22:25.384
Jesus Christ,

22:25.510 --> 22:27.887
I let them hold my hands
and pray for me.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.555
- I don't think she's that bad.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.098
She apologized when I left.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.438
- Did she?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.709
- "The object
that's most sacred to me

22:58.835 --> 23:02.046
"is a small fluffy bear
my dad gave me when I was nine.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.841
"He left when I was ten,
and I haven't seen him since.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.760
"I try not to blame him
for what he did

23:07.886 --> 23:09.804
"and remember that he loved me.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.013
"At least he did then,

23:11.139 --> 23:16.268
"because he told me so
with tears in his eyes.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.436
"I guess he knew he was leaving

23:17.562 --> 23:20.523
"and this was
his good-bye present.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.191
"It is sacred to me

23:22.317 --> 23:26.070
because it represents
my capacity to forgive."

24:12.617 --> 24:15.119
- Good job.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.666
How many beds
you get done in a day?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.376
One?
Two?

24:22.502 --> 24:24.336
- I get my work done.

24:34.181 --> 24:38.476
- Just making a bed
in our own little room.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.855
It's okay to laugh, you know.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.191
It's in the employee manual.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.359
In fact, it says when
the management makes a joke,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.195
you have to laugh.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.321
- Ha-ha.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.535
- Actually, I just came by to
thank you for dinner last night.

24:58.079 --> 25:01.790
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.501
- What are you sorry about?

25:03.627 --> 25:06.253
- The gay thing.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.714
- I'd like to say I'm sorry
I reacted the way I did,

25:08.840 --> 25:10.424
but I'm not,

25:10.550 --> 25:12.551
so I won't.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.226
I read your essay.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.479
It's pretty good.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.564
You want to grab lunch
and talk about it?

25:30.278 --> 25:33.113
I'll promote you
to room service.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.698
- How corrupt you are.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.374
- All right,
forget about it.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.792
I'll see you later.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.670
- I'd like to.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.547
It's just one of the maids here

25:49.673 --> 25:51.799
goes to the same church
as me and Joe.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.719
- I'm inviting you to lunch,
Shana, not to a hotel.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.641
In fact, we'd actually be
leaving a hotel.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.226
You'd be a lot safer.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.820
- He was a truck driver, my dad.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.739
He had this huge red truck.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.325
He was gone a lot,
and then he'd come back,

26:18.451 --> 26:21.370
and me and my mom
would be waiting for him.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.080
And the first thing
he'd always do

26:23.206 --> 26:25.124
was find fault in something.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.418
You know, like he had
to remind us who was boss.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.630
- Did he hit you?

26:31.756 --> 26:35.968
- Yeah.
Both of us.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.762
But I don't think
he could help it.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.472
- Maybe he left
'cause he was scared

26:40.599 --> 26:42.433
he'd really hurt you
one day.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.479
- I'd like to think so.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.114
- Want a beer?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.490
- Beer at lunch?

26:58.617 --> 27:01.160
Quite the role model, Boss.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.203
- You never drink?

27:03.330 --> 27:05.497
- Almost never.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.166
- You want to make an exception?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.250
- Why would I?

27:08.376 --> 27:09.668
- I don't know.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.794
'Cause it might be fun.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.505
-Well, in that case...

27:15.091 --> 27:16.842
You got an opener?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.344
- It's not a twist-off?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.554
- It's okay.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.808
- Holy shit.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.853
Note to self:
Decline blowjob if offered.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.191
- Oh, my God.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.290
So your friend Chris,
he's into that Kabbalah thing?

27:48.416 --> 27:49.583
- Yeah.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.210
- What's it about?

27:51.336 --> 27:53.212
- I have no idea.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.549
Some new age crap like,
E.G.O., ego:

27:57.676 --> 27:59.259
Everyone's Got One.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.720
It's a total crock of shit.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.598
- Wow, you're kind of
an angry person, aren't you?

28:04.724 --> 28:08.227
- Me?

28:08.353 --> 28:10.104
How can you not be?

28:10.230 --> 28:13.023
I mean, take this homophobia
crap, for example.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.650
If I was in charge
of this country,

28:14.776 --> 28:16.276
I'd ban heterosexual marriage.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.903
- What?
Why?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.738
- 'Cause heteros breed too much.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.073
Gay men tend to adopt.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.491
In an overcrowded world,

28:22.617 --> 28:27.413
why would any reasonable person
discourage them in any way?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.540
- Hmm.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.428
I better get back to work.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.264
Want my beer?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.558
- Sure.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.476
- Thanks for lunch.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.696
- Jesus Christ, Gavin.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.614
What the hell's
the matter with you?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.950
I'll tell you
what's the matter with me.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.536
The minute Joe started off

29:07.662 --> 29:11.915
on that homophobic
biblical bullshit,

29:12.041 --> 29:14.293
I decided to liberate his wife.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.961
I was thinking of it as, like,

29:16.087 --> 29:19.006
a Operation Rescue
type of thing.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.799
I mean, come on,

29:20.925 --> 29:24.178
what's a woman like that
doing with a man like him?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.564
- Excuse me.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.090
- Daddy!

30:02.217 --> 30:05.010
- What are you doing back?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.470
- I forgot something.

30:06.596 --> 30:07.513
- You okay?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.348
- Yeah.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.599
Why don't you all
get to your bus

30:10.725 --> 30:13.393
before you're late for school?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.606
- Hi.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.487
Is everything okay?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.030
- No.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.907
Come inside.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.621
- Hollis, what's wrong?

30:32.747 --> 30:44.258
Tell me.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.426
- Whose kids are these?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.681
Whose kids are these?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.101
I'm asking you
whose kids they are!

30:57.522 --> 30:59.565
Will you just tell me
how you can let me,

30:59.691 --> 31:01.692
for all these years,

31:01.818 --> 31:04.194
go around thinking
these are my damn kids

31:04.320 --> 31:05.946
and I can't have any!

31:06.072 --> 31:10.450
Whose kids are these?

31:10.577 --> 31:11.702
Tell me!

31:11.828 --> 31:13.745
- This is not what you think.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.456
- What am I supposed to think?

31:36.227 --> 31:38.353
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

31:38.479 --> 31:40.814
I will fear no evil.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.859
Hey, forgive me.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.449
- You okay?

31:53.036 --> 31:55.495
- Yeah, now,
don't worry about me.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.836
All right, then,
where were we?

32:16.267 --> 32:17.684
- Oh, whoa.
- Excuse me.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.145
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.522
- Hey, Gavin.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.650
Sorry about the other night.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.443
Thought you were gay.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.403
- Hey, I'm a nonbeliever.

32:28.529 --> 32:30.030
You can hate me
for that instead.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.075
- Well, I don't hate gay people,
Gavin.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.619
- Love the sinner,
hate the sin?

32:35.745 --> 32:37.412
- Absolutely.

32:37.538 --> 32:39.247
You know, if your friend
doesn't correct his ways,

32:39.374 --> 32:40.540
he's going to hell.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.334
And I'd do anything
to avoid that, Gavin,

32:42.460 --> 32:43.877
because hell's a reality.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.045
- Well, I'm late,

32:45.171 --> 32:46.838
so maybe you can tell me
how you know this

32:46.965 --> 32:47.839
some other time, okay?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.675
I mean, have you been to hell?

32:49.801 --> 32:50.759
Ever met anyone who's-

32:50.885 --> 32:52.511
- How about Wednesday night?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.554
- Hell and homos,
Wednesday night?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.765
- And philosophy.
Salvation.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.642
- Look, I got to go,
or I'm gonna miss my bus-

32:58.768 --> 33:03.021
- Hey, you know,
don't be so close-minded.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.983
- Are you willing to admit
that God might not exist?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.025
- No.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.778
- So who's being
close-minded here?

33:09.904 --> 33:12.739
- Maybe you can change my mind.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.996
- Okay.
Philosophy, Wednesday night.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.873
- There you go.
7:00.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.209
- Sure.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.849
- So how's the gay lifestyle
treating you?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.726
- Fine.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.478
How's the hetero lifestyle
treating you?

33:45.148 --> 33:47.190
- You ever been married?

33:47.316 --> 33:48.567
- Yeah.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.777
But something tells me
the problems I had

33:50.903 --> 33:52.612
are not the problems
you're having.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.115
- What do you think
the problems I'm having are?

33:57.493 --> 33:59.077
- Appreciating
someone's kindness

33:59.203 --> 34:02.289
isn't necessarily the same thing
as being in love.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.294
- Man, you have a big mouth.

34:08.795 --> 34:11.380
- Sorry.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.679
- Have you ever seen
a happy marriage?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.849
I mean, really happy?

34:20.975 --> 34:22.601
- I have to say,

34:22.726 --> 34:25.437
for the first few years of my
marriage, I was very happy.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.356
- And what happened?

34:28.483 --> 34:31.109
- And then she left me.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.195
- When was this?

34:33.321 --> 34:35.072
- Two years ago.

34:35.197 --> 34:38.742
- Boy, you sure take your time
to recover, don't you?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.621
- You know what, Shana?
You're right.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.581
Way too long.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.542
But if you do
the charitable thing here

34:47.668 --> 34:50.128
and start having sex with me
on a regular basis,

34:50.254 --> 34:52.297
pretty sure
I'd start healing right away.

34:55.301 --> 34:57.594
You have a very sexy mouth.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.766
- A very sexy married mouth.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.562
- That's right.
I forgot.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.823
You see, the trick,
I figured,

35:17.949 --> 35:20.158
having been on the receiving end
of such a thing,

35:20.284 --> 35:22.327
was just to open the door.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.539
After that, if she had
the slightest interest,

35:25.665 --> 35:30.335
well, next time
her husband's cold to her,

35:30.461 --> 35:32.462
couple of thoughts blow in.

35:32.588 --> 35:37.425
Pretty soon, what blows in
is more than just nice.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.219
It's perfect.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.762
I mean, why wouldn't it be?

35:40.888 --> 35:44.015
It's in her head.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.477
She thinks, "What's the harm
in just thinking about this

35:47.603 --> 35:49.938
if it makes me feel good?"

35:50.064 --> 35:53.024
And then it's,
"Well, what's the harm

35:53.151 --> 35:55.819
in just thinking about this
and coming?"

35:58.739 --> 36:00.824
And so she comes.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.828
Well, that takes care of that.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.413
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

36:06.539 --> 36:10.876
- What a relief.
Never again.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.294
- The cantaloupe looks great.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.713
- Trouble is,
a connection's been made.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.215
She remembers it vividly.

36:17.341 --> 36:21.720
I kissed her lips.
I was inside her.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.264
Maybe I even said I loved her.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.726
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:30.104 --> 36:33.565
- So look what we got
from a single remark.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.234
Now we add in something else.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.278
Look, I'm embarrassed.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.406
What I said the other day
was totally out of line.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.700
I'm really sorry, okay?

36:43.826 --> 36:46.536
- It's okay.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.205
- It's not, really.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.040
I've never done that before
with an employee,

36:50.166 --> 36:52.709
and I won't do it again, okay?

36:54.587 --> 36:57.464
- You're forgiven.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.549
- Abandonment-

36:59.675 --> 37:01.676
clearly a big issue for her.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.470
"What, I haven't even had
the guy for real,

37:03.596 --> 37:06.223
and now he's slamming the door
in my face?"

37:12.104 --> 37:13.897
I know.

37:14.023 --> 37:18.068
But don't hate me yet,
trust me.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.362
I got mine coming.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.492
- Now, let me ask you.

37:25.618 --> 37:26.868
You ever look around

37:26.994 --> 37:29.996
and the world just seems
empty to you?

37:31.749 --> 37:33.166
- Oh, yeah.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.376
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe

37:34.502 --> 37:36.086
it's because
you don't have God in your life?

37:38.089 --> 37:39.005
- No.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.465
- Never?

37:41.884 --> 37:45.303
- Look, Joe, when I was a kid,

37:45.429 --> 37:46.972
I totally believed in God.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.307
But, you know, you grow up.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.643
Well, I did.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.686
I looked around.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.104
I said,
"Santa Claus: No evidence.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.648
"The tooth fairy: No evidence.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.733
"God, the same thing:

37:58.859 --> 38:00.193
No evidence."

38:00.319 --> 38:02.028
And then you think,

38:02.154 --> 38:03.321
"Hmm.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.658
I wonder if I really need
all these imaginary friends."

38:08.119 --> 38:10.662
- So you think God's
just a pleasant thing?

38:10.788 --> 38:13.498
Like it's easier
to believe than not?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.334
- Well, easier for you, clearly.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.044
- No, Gavin, faith is hard.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.505
God tests you
time and time again.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.757
Sometimes He even demands
that you die for Him.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.551
You think that's easy?

38:24.677 --> 38:26.344
- For people of faith, sure.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.554
That's the problem.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.056
Like, I could never fly
a jet into a building.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.641
But those 9/11 guys could

38:31.767 --> 38:33.977
'cause they had faith
in an afterlife,

38:34.103 --> 38:36.646
not to mention 72 virgins,

38:36.772 --> 38:41.151
though why anyone would want
virgins, I don't know.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.409
- What did God do to you
to make you so angry at Him?

38:51.162 --> 38:52.871
Look at the world
that He created,

38:52.997 --> 38:54.831
all the beauty.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.459
- Wars and plagues
and genocides

38:57.585 --> 39:00.128
and earthquakes and tidal waves.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.048
And then,
after all that suffering,

39:03.174 --> 39:05.091
what does your God do next?

39:05.217 --> 39:08.053
He sends most of us to hell.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.013
- Well, not if you've
been born again.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.766
- Right, the old
baptismal Jacuzzi.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.392
- You have to accept
Jesus Christ

39:14.518 --> 39:15.852
as your Lord and Savior.

39:15.978 --> 39:18.355
That is your only
entrance requirement.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.940
- Okay, so the Hebes,
the Hindus,

39:21.067 --> 39:23.818
the Muslims, the atheists,
the Buddhists,

39:23.944 --> 39:25.403
all damned, right?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.322
- They have to accept
Jesus Christ.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.365
- And the Catholics,

39:28.491 --> 39:31.451
'cause they're not
born again, right?

39:31.577 --> 39:32.702
- Right.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.746
- Face it, man,
it's kind of crazy.

39:34.872 --> 39:35.830
- No, it's not crazy.

39:35.956 --> 39:38.249
God gives us free will
for that purpose.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.293
Otherwise,
we would just be puppets.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.087
Life would be...

39:43.422 --> 39:45.006
Life would be meaningless.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.759
That's the beauty
of eternal salvation.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.929
You see, anyone can go
to heaven or hell,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.056
because anyone can be saved.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.058
It's your choice.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.852
- Unless you're a kid in China
who gets hit by a bus

39:57.978 --> 39:59.813
and never even heard
of this getting saved deal.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.439
Where's his choice?

40:01.565 --> 40:02.732
- Well, that's why
it's so important

40:02.858 --> 40:05.402
to spread the gospel,
try and save people.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.113
- I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.573
I just find this kind
of fundamentalism incredible.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.617
I mean, all of you,

40:12.743 --> 40:15.537
totally convinced
you know exactly who God is

40:15.663 --> 40:18.164
and exactly how He wants
to be worshipped

40:18.290 --> 40:21.126
and all without a lick
of evidence He even exists.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.462
- No wonder
there are so many holy wars.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.881
Without evidence, how else
would you win this argument

40:27.007 --> 40:28.758
except by killing each other?

40:31.387 --> 40:35.432
- See, I see evidence
in all kinds of things.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.474
- So do they.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.725
And sooner or later,

40:37.852 --> 40:40.437
one of these guys
who hears God in his head

40:40.563 --> 40:42.981
is gonna get ahold
of weapons of mass destruction,

40:43.107 --> 40:45.442
and then,
when it's way too late,

40:45.568 --> 40:47.402
we're finally
gonna ask ourselves,

40:47.528 --> 40:50.113
"Why, after thousands of years
of bloodshed,

40:50.239 --> 40:52.490
"didn't we at least try
to do away

40:52.616 --> 40:54.617
"with this insane concept
of faith

40:54.743 --> 40:58.037
before it fucking killed us?"

40:58.164 --> 40:59.622
- You know,
maybe I'm just coming at this

40:59.748 --> 41:01.875
from a different angle.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.294
- And what angle would that be?

41:04.420 --> 41:07.172
- Well, it's not abstract to me.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.339
I go to the hospital,

41:08.466 --> 41:11.843
and I visit
sick children, right?

41:11.969 --> 41:15.513
Two days ago, I was
at the bedside of a dying child.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.183
His mother and father
were killed in an auto accident.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.809
He's about to pass as well.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.979
And he asks me
if heaven really exists.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.774
I say, "Yes, it does.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.194
It's where Mommy and Daddy are."

41:29.320 --> 41:33.281
About an hour or so later,
he dies

41:33.407 --> 41:35.241
with a smile on his face.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.163
So what would you have said
in my place-

41:40.289 --> 41:44.000
"Sorry, kid,
no evidence"?

41:45.544 --> 41:46.920
- No.

41:47.046 --> 41:50.173
I probably would have told him
exactly the same lie you did.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.551
But, Joe,
I'll tell you one thing

41:53.677 --> 41:55.929
I damned sure
wouldn't have said,

41:56.055 --> 41:57.305
and that's, "I'm sorry kid.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.517
You're going to hell
if you haven't been baptized."

42:00.643 --> 42:04.395
- Lord, forgive this man for his
hard heart and his blasphemy.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.731
I think he has suffered
much more than he knows,

42:06.857 --> 42:08.858
and he needs your love
and support now more than ever-

42:08.984 --> 42:09.901
- No!

42:10.027 --> 42:10.985
Joe, I'm sorry,

42:11.111 --> 42:12.779
but you don't know
a damned thing about me,

42:12.905 --> 42:15.198
and I don't need your help
or your salvation

42:15.324 --> 42:18.326
or any other fucking bullshit
you may have to offer.

42:18.452 --> 42:20.662
- Don't swear
in front of my wife!

42:20.788 --> 42:23.206
- Gavin,
I think you should leave.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.049
- With pleasure.

42:38.347 --> 42:39.430
- Why can't you
leave people alone?

42:39.557 --> 42:42.100
- Don't you dare
talk to me.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.393
You get out of my sight.

42:54.780 --> 42:57.448
- What the hell are you doing,
Chris?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.867
- It's blessed water
from the temple.

42:59.994 --> 43:03.121
- And how much
did you pay for that?

43:03.247 --> 43:06.624
- I'm not going to tell you.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.085
- I'm surrounded by imbeciles.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.464
- Hi, I'm Frank.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.134
I met Chris at temple.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.594
- Hmm.

43:30.941 --> 43:31.816
Hey.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.485
- Can we meet
where we met before?

43:36.697 --> 43:38.114
- Sure.

43:39.908 --> 43:43.953
- When I was 18,
I got into drugs

43:44.079 --> 43:46.414
and then into harder drugs,

43:46.540 --> 43:49.542
and then I couldn't
afford them anymore.

43:49.668 --> 43:52.503
And then I met a pimp.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.172
And one night,
he sent me to see this john

43:54.298 --> 43:57.175
who liked to do it in church.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.635
But what he didn't tell me

43:58.761 --> 44:01.971
was that the guy liked to beat
the girl when he was done.

44:04.099 --> 44:07.852
I woke up in the morning,
and I couldn't even walk.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.146
I didn't know what to do.

44:10.272 --> 44:12.106
So I started to crawl
towards the altar

44:12.232 --> 44:15.568
to see if there was something
I could steal.

44:15.694 --> 44:17.278
But I didn't realize
it was Sunday morning,

44:17.404 --> 44:19.697
and I got caught.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.867
That was the day I met Joe.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.746
And he took me to the hospital,
and he stayed with me.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.209
If it weren't for him,

44:31.335 --> 44:35.421
I don't think I'd be alive
right now.

44:35.547 --> 44:38.299
He was the first man
who ever saw

44:38.425 --> 44:41.511
something better in me
than what I was.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.350
Joe takes care of me.

44:51.063 --> 44:54.357
- You don't need anyone
to take care of you, Shana.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.237
You're a strong,
intelligent woman.

44:59.363 --> 45:02.156
- Yeah.

45:02.282 --> 45:05.702
Will you do me a favor
and stay away from my husband?

45:07.663 --> 45:09.372
Please?

45:11.875 --> 45:13.710
- I'll do whatever you want.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.925
- Believe it or not,
you actually got through to him.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.719
- Really?

45:22.845 --> 45:25.847
- He's decided we need
to be more evangelical.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.516
We're going to a new church.

45:28.642 --> 45:33.187
They do missionary work
in Uganda.

45:33.313 --> 45:35.440
- What else?

45:35.566 --> 45:38.234
- They're against smoking
and drinking,

45:38.360 --> 45:40.111
immodest dress for women,

45:40.237 --> 45:41.779
and secular music.

45:41.905 --> 45:45.742
- Pfft.
Jesus Christ.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.285
Restrings your guitar one day,

45:47.411 --> 45:49.829
stops you from playing it
the next.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.290
- You're so flippant,
aren't you?

45:52.416 --> 45:53.958
You have no idea

45:54.084 --> 45:55.626
what it's like
to lose everything

45:55.753 --> 45:59.630
and to try and put it all
back together again.

45:59.757 --> 46:00.798
- Actually, Shana-

46:00.924 --> 46:03.176
- You don't know
what it's like for me and Joe.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.765
-I'm sorry.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.811
I really didn't mean
to cause you problems.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.229
I'm a fuckin' moron.

46:15.355 --> 46:19.525
- Not even a little smirk,
Gavin?

46:19.651 --> 46:23.237
- I think I made a big mistake.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.658
You're so beautiful.

46:29.119 --> 46:33.206
- You're pretty cute yourself.

46:33.332 --> 46:36.709
That's why I'm gonna ask you
to stay away from me too.

46:38.754 --> 46:42.048
Don't make this hard for me,
okay?

46:49.932 --> 46:52.016
- Fuck.

47:11.745 --> 47:15.039
- She said stay away, huh?

47:15.165 --> 47:17.834
Guess you didn't listen.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.710
- No, I did.

47:19.837 --> 47:23.673
I stayed away
for, like, three weeks.

48:19.229 --> 48:20.563
- Consuela, what's wrong?

48:20.689 --> 48:22.523
- My father died.

48:22.649 --> 48:25.359
Please let him into heaven.

48:25.485 --> 48:28.154
You ask, too, Gavin.

48:29.823 --> 48:33.326
- Please let Consuela's father
into heaven.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.994
He must've been a good man,

48:35.120 --> 48:38.956
or Consuela would not be
such a good woman.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.295
I'm so sorry, Consuela.

48:57.976 --> 49:01.145
Getting serious, huh?

49:01.271 --> 49:03.564
- He's a nice guy.
We have a lot in common.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.528
- Is the rabbi gonna marry you?

49:09.655 --> 49:12.198
- Don't provoke me.

49:12.324 --> 49:15.201
- Sorry.

49:15.327 --> 49:18.204
- Look, as it happens,
we're gonna ask,

49:18.330 --> 49:20.039
just hypothetically.

49:20.165 --> 49:21.791
We have an appointment.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.504
- Good luck.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.464
- Since when do you smoke?

49:28.590 --> 49:30.591
- I don't smoke.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.856
- Mind if I join you?

49:45.983 --> 49:47.525
- Not at all.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.573
- Can I have a drag of that?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.158
- You sure?

49:56.284 --> 49:59.203
- Don't you start.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.842
I was on my way to the store.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.177
Got kind of claustrophobic.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.182
- Things not so good, huh?

50:20.308 --> 50:23.561
- Yeah.
Not so good.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.813
- I'm sorry.

50:25.939 --> 50:28.941
- You know what the problem is?

50:29.067 --> 50:31.068
When I was doing
what I was doing,

50:31.194 --> 50:34.697
I enjoyed it
in a sick kind of way.

50:34.823 --> 50:37.033
I really liked getting high.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.285
It was a relief.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.080
But it was killing me,

50:43.206 --> 50:46.292
and Joe showed me something
better that wouldn't kill me.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.961
- What?
What did he show you?

50:49.087 --> 50:50.838
- How to be at peace

50:50.964 --> 50:54.133
by being in touch with
something bigger than myself.

50:54.259 --> 50:56.719
- I got that for you.

51:01.224 --> 51:04.143
Come on.
Lie down over here.

51:04.269 --> 51:06.979
- That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

51:07.105 --> 51:10.232
- Come on. Trust me.
Lie down.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.290
There you have it.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.626
- What?

51:28.752 --> 51:30.795
- The universe.

51:30.921 --> 51:34.799
I mean, look at it.
It's incredible.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.761
You know, some of the stars
you can see on a clear night,

51:38.887 --> 51:40.012
their light,

51:40.138 --> 51:44.308
it's taken 21/2 million years
to get here.

51:44.434 --> 51:47.436
When that light started out,
the Ice Age hadn't even begun.

51:47.562 --> 51:50.481
When you want a connection
to something bigger,

51:50.607 --> 51:52.775
how much bigger can you get
than this?

51:52.901 --> 51:54.985
- It's pretty big.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.655
- Yeah.

51:57.781 --> 52:00.157
And we're a part of it,

52:00.283 --> 52:03.994
a lucky part of it,
'cause as far as we know,

52:04.121 --> 52:05.830
only Earth came together
in a way

52:05.956 --> 52:08.958
that enabled life to exist.

52:09.084 --> 52:11.210
I mean, what a break, right?

52:11.336 --> 52:15.756
Thank you, universe.

52:15.882 --> 52:19.802
And then you die, and that's it.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.471
- Oh, now I'm definitely
feeling better.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.519
- You should.

52:28.645 --> 52:33.899
Once you understand
that life is finite,

52:34.025 --> 52:36.861
you don't want to waste
a moment of it.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.445
- I hate to say it,

52:38.572 --> 52:41.699
but I'm not getting
the same buzz I get from church.

52:41.825 --> 52:43.242
- Why not?

52:43.368 --> 52:46.162
- 'Cause I want someone up there
I can talk to.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.916
- That's what I thought, see?

52:51.042 --> 52:54.461
You don't want a spiritual life
based on truth.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.088
You want a daddy in the sky,

52:56.214 --> 52:58.299
and even if he is
totally imaginary,

52:58.425 --> 53:01.093
he's always gonna be there
when you need him.

53:03.847 --> 53:07.391
- What I want is to be loved.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.457
- I'm sorry.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.731
- We thank you, Lord,
for your love and salvation,

53:55.857 --> 53:58.025
but we are afraid.

53:58.151 --> 54:00.903
If you call us
to do your work in Uganda,

54:01.029 --> 54:04.698
please give us courage.

54:04.824 --> 54:07.826
And also, Lord,

54:07.953 --> 54:12.456
please give us the strength
to resist temptation,

54:12.582 --> 54:16.794
for sometimes we are
sorely tried in this evil world.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.128
Amen.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.256
- Amen.

54:39.776 --> 54:44.238
- I don't think I've ever loved
anyone before you.

54:44.364 --> 54:47.366
Now I'm not even sure
I could live without you.

54:47.492 --> 54:49.868
- Joe.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.621
- But if we are to be laborers
together with God,

54:52.747 --> 54:56.125
then we have to answer
when He calls.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.460
- What about my education?

55:01.381 --> 55:03.632
- Is that what this is about,
Shana?

55:03.758 --> 55:06.969
Really?

55:07.095 --> 55:08.304
- Yes.

55:11.808 --> 55:15.227
- I don't want us to live
a small life, Shana.

55:23.778 --> 55:25.779
- Yup?

55:45.842 --> 55:48.052
Hold on!

55:48.178 --> 55:51.680
Here.
Call me.

55:51.806 --> 55:52.848
- Who's Exley?

55:52.974 --> 55:54.975
- Oh, he used to work here.

55:55.101 --> 55:56.894
- I have to go to school.

56:00.815 --> 56:01.732
- Hold on!

56:01.858 --> 56:03.233
- I'll call you
as soon as I can.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.152
- Okay.

56:05.278 --> 56:07.279
Here.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.106
Hello?

56:42.232 --> 56:43.565
- Tonight around 8:00?

56:43.691 --> 56:45.234
- Yes.

56:46.903 --> 56:48.153
- Where?

56:48.279 --> 56:49.738
- The hotel.

56:49.864 --> 56:51.615
I'll find a room and email you.

56:51.741 --> 56:55.244
- You really put
some thought into this, huh?

56:55.370 --> 56:58.247
- Yeah.

56:58.373 --> 56:59.957
- So did I.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.313
- When do you reckon
you'll get back?

58:05.857 --> 58:07.441
- I'm just filling in
for someone.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.693
I don't know
when they'll show up.

58:11.779 --> 58:12.905
- Okay.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.306
- Hi.

58:44.979 --> 58:46.647
- Want a drink?

58:46.773 --> 58:48.732
- I think I need one.

58:53.571 --> 58:56.365
Are all these flowers for me?

58:56.491 --> 58:58.325
- Stole 'em from the ballroom.

58:58.451 --> 59:01.411
- Wedding?

59:01.538 --> 59:03.664
- Memorial service.

59:28.731 --> 59:31.066
You don't have to do it.

59:36.364 --> 59:38.156
Let me undress you.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.377
You're perfect.

You have God.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.396
I am washed, sanctified,

- When I got home last night,
he wasn't there.

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:14.206
Then he came back,
and I asked him where he'd been,

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.876
and he said, "Thinking.
Where have you been?"

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.836
- Then what?

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.798
- And then this morning,
he was distant,

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:25.175
and then he just went to work.

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:34.518
- Why don't you leave him?

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.478
I mean it.

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:42.692
- I'm afraid of what
he might do to himself.

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:45.195
- Like what?

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.031
- I don't know.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.533
I feel scared of him,

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.535
and I feel sorry for him

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.996
and grateful and ashamed.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.835
But at the same time,
it's-

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:02.295
I sort of can't even think
about him.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.675
It's like he's disappearing.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:09.427
All I can think about is you.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.599
- I feel the same way.

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.518
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:20.146
- Really?

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:23.692
Could we see each other again
tonight?

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.069
- How would you get out?

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.780
- He's going
to some church thing

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:31.157
from 7:00 to 10:00.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.577
- Chris too.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.246
Finally something
to thank God for.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.756
- I'm sorry.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.342
- Take it.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:50.719
I'll wait.

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:54.890
- What do you want?

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:58.226
- Hey.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:00.312
I just wanted
to give you a family.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:03.148
- What makes you think
I want to talk about this now?

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.317
- Hollis, it was
just an arrangement.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.651
That's all.

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:09.613
Hollis, I was just afraid
of losing you, so I just-

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.615
- I'm up here on the ledge
with somebody and-

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.866
- Please, Hollis.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.326
I love you.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.620
- I cannot have
this conversation right now.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.455
- I love you.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.498
I love you more
than anything in life.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.918
- Look, I got to go.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.926
- You have to go?

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:32.677
- No, no, no, no.
I'm good.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.432
So what happened next?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.691
- Well, I better be going.

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:48.652
- Okay.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.487
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.087
- I want to do it here.

01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:50.839
- Okay.

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:03.810
- Take my panties off.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.031
Oh, my...

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.578
I love the way you touch me.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.096
- Who is that?

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:27.977
- That's my daughter.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.312
- You have a daughter?

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.981
- I had a daughter.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.692
- What happened?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:38.654
- She died two years ago.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.282
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:42.658
- I'm sure she's up in heaven

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.828
with all the other
little baby angels.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.711
I'm sorry.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.755
I don't mean to be
such an asshole.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.049
I really don't.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.267
I was driving her
to school one day.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.520
And we'd had a fight.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.064
The radio was on.

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:16.526
There was a song
we both really liked.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:20.697
She was singing along.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.448
I was watching her
in the mirror,

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.327
and I was just about to tell her
that it was all okay,

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:31.374
and then a truck
swerved from traffic

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:36.171
from the opposite direction,

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:40.216
and I had less than a second
to think.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:43.428
And I don't know if it was
instinct or a bad guess

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:48.433
or maybe self-preservation,
but...

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.604
I swung the wheel
the wrong way,

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.524
and the truck hit her side
of the car.

01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:06.743
And five minutes later,
she's dead.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:29.224
My wife never blamed me,
exactly.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.019
It was-the truck driver
had a heart attack.

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:35.063
It wasn't my fault, but...

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.734
It was in her eyes.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:45.031
I needed her to forgive me,
and she couldn't do it.

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:52.455
And so we split up,
and I totally fell apart.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.541
And then I got a job
in the hospitality industry.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:59.462
And now I'm just dandy.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:20.733
- Oh!

01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:22.527
Uh, I thought you were out.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.237
I was gonna get a sip
of your whiskey.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:25.863
We-
- You ever think of knocking?

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.740
- Excuse us.
Sorry.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.158
- What happened?

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:35.623
- Uh, you were right.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:39.294
Turns out this center
is a little more conservative

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.753
than we thought.

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:43.423
- Light gets switched off
before it reaches the homos?

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.175
- Not exactly.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.343
Dimmed.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.804
- Sorry.
Really.

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:54.684
- Hey.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.728
To the grave, okay?

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.693
- Oh.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.528
- It's okay.
He's cool.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.030
Both of them.

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.873
- You know,

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:21.002
if you and I
could ever be together,

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:24.130
I think we'd be really happy.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:36.976
- Strange thing is,
I felt the same way.

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:39.103
I had to make a game of it
at the start...

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:41.898
'cause I wasn't really up
for it, you know?

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.358
Love.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:46.736
- No wonder.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.404
- I guess
it's always inexplicable

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.656
why you fall in love, isn't it?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:53.659
I mean, you tell me,
why do you love your wife?

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:58.790
- To be honest with you,
Gavin,

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.583
I don't think I do anymore.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.918
As a matter of fact,

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.836
I don't even think
I'm going home tonight.

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.296
- Why not?

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.465
- She cheated on me.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.512
I kind of lost
both of my kids today.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:16.474
My little boy and my girl,
you know.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.560
Found out neither one of 'em
was mine this morning.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.732
- Why?

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:27.693
- 'Cause I'm sterile.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.612
I just found out.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.617
I've always been.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.577
- Did you want kids?

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:39.914
- Like you wouldn't believe,
you know?

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.125
I mean, we tried and tried
for years,

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.336
and when nothing happened,

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:47.630
eventually we went over
to the clinic,

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.924
and we got tested.

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:52.218
And I never bothered
to go and get the results.

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:53.928
But she did.

01:13:54.054 --> 01:13:58.307
And when she told me
everything was okay, I was...

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.643
And then nine months later, we-

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:10.778
She said that she was afraid
she was going to lose me

01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:13.489
and that it was just
an arrangement.

01:14:17.202 --> 01:14:18.703
- Who's the father?

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:30.256
- She wanted the kids to look
as much like me as possible.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.720
I got a younger brother, man.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.852
Look, I'm sorry,
Gavin,

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.313
but please don't make my day
any worse than it already is.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:48.858
Why don't you just
come on in here?

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.526
- Believe me,

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.029
if I could, I would.

01:14:54.781 --> 01:14:56.574
- Hollis.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.909
- Excuse me.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:14:59.327
- Spoke to the roommate, Chris.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.746
He says he thinks Joe's capable
ofjust about anything.

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:03.080
Shana never made it to school.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.207
Joe never showed up for work.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.583
I've been trying both
their numbers.

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:06.834
I got nothing.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.419
- Please, keep calling them.
- All right.

01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:10.755
How's he doin'?

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:13.424
- Do I think he might do it?

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.468
I think he could.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:19.096
- All right.
Are you good?

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:22.016
- I'm having a rough day.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.414
Hey, forgive me.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:49.460
- Look man, the point is,
you got kids,

01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:52.046
even if it wasn't exactly
how you wanted.

01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:59.387
- Let's just go on
with your story, okay?

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:06.727
- Okay.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:10.439
We decided to tell Joe
the truth.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.692
But Shana wanted to speak
to the pastor first

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.278
'cause she was so scared
he'd kill himself.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.748
- I know I haven't been
an exciting lover for you.

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:31.877
I know that I have been
too dominating

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:36.465
in a way
that wasn't interesting.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.093
But I wasn't always like this.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:44.473
I know how bad things are.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.060
I just want one night.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:52.189
Borrow an apartment.
Go to a hotel.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:56.402
A night away from
what we're supposed to be,

01:16:56.528 --> 01:17:00.156
a night to prove I can
make you happy that way.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.953
Don't I at least deserve that?

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:08.497
- I have to get out of this
the right way.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.166
I owe him so much.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.168
- I know.

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.421
I know, and I know
I have no right, but...

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.676
- We only have to get through
a couple more days, okay?

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.970
Okay?

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:26.515
- Okay.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.351
- I should go.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.602
I'm doing the night shift,

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.604
and then I'm gonna go see
the pastor in the morning.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.855
- Come by after.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.690
Let me know how it went.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.911
- I love you.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.526
- Crescent Riverview.

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:20.903
- Hi.
I'd like a room, please.

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.322
- When would it be for?

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:24.865
- Tonight, if you've got one.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:56.772
Come on in.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.576
Would you mind if we talked?

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:12.079
- Oh-
- Please, it's important.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.422
Sit down.

01:19:29.973 --> 01:19:33.976
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Gavin?

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:35.352
- No.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:38.147
- There are two differences.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:41.275
First of all, you don't see
the world as it is.

01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:44.320
This world
is a disgusting place.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.489
I know this because I've seen
some of the worst

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.115
it has to offer.

01:19:51.077 --> 01:19:52.995
- I find that hard to believe.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.372
- Did you know
I was married before?

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.335
- No, I didn't know that, Joe.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.795
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.381
A lovely wife,

01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:07.676
two beautiful children,

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.178
great home.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:12.515
But I couldn't stay home,
because I was drawn to sin.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.308
I'd go out for a drink,
and five hours later,

01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:15.684
I'd be coked out of my head

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:18.479
and in a booth in a porno shop,
or I'd get a hooker,

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:20.981
or I'd go-go gambling,

01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:23.943
or pretty much whatever
you can imagine, I did.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:27.196
And I lost it all.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:30.825
My wife left me.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.284
She caught diseases from me.

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:35.621
I lost my job.

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:38.374
I lost my children.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.085
But even still, I couldn't stop.

01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:45.047
I mean, so what do you think
that is?

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.675
You think
I'm, like, a sex addict

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:52.888
or a junkie
or a gambling addict,

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:53.931
alcoholic?

01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:55.057
What?

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.644
- I don't know, Joe.

01:20:58.770 --> 01:20:59.687
I have no idea.

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:02.273
- The answer
is none of the above.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.109
I just had to have sensation.

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:10.781
I had to feel alive,
because inside, I was dying.

01:21:10.907 --> 01:21:13.993
Spiritually, right?
I was lost.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:22.668
See, I was, you know,
half an inch from death

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:25.087
when Jesus came to me.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.338
I was.

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:29.508
I was lying in the gutter
and got up,

01:21:29.634 --> 01:21:35.014
stumbled into a church,
and I was born again.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.641
I was saved.

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:41.270
I was a new man.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:45.608
The joy-the relief, really...

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.321
You have no idea how that feels.

01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:55.117
About a year later,

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:59.330
the Lord, having given me
so much already,

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:03.125
He gave me Shana.

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:06.670
He brought her into the church.

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:09.965
And the moment that I saw her,

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:14.053
I knew that I loved her.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:18.140
Then we were married
in His sight,

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:21.101
in His house.

01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:22.937
And loving her was the-

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:30.778
It was such a pure love.

01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:36.492
Until two nights ago.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.995
When you were...

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:43.248
fucking her in your kitchen,

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.835
I was outside the door,
listening.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:51.423
And I thought
of smashing down that door

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:54.218
and killing you both.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.763
But I just ran away.

01:22:57.889 --> 01:22:58.931
I ran away, and I did things

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.684
that I have not done
in a long time.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.520
And when I came home,
she was asleep in there.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:09.483
And I watched her lying there.

01:23:09.609 --> 01:23:11.735
And she was smiling.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:21.704
It's hard when we lose
someone we love,

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:22.830
isn't it?

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.084
- Yes, it is.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:31.005
- So I came in here,

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:34.258
and I opened up the Bible.

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:39.722
And I read Psalm 23.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:43.684
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.270
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:48.897
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:54.319
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:57.698
And I took this gun,
and I put it right here.

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.535
Now...

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:05.831
You think I'm still here
because I was afraid?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.125
- I don't know, Joe.

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.127
- No.

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:13.922
I have no fear, Gavin.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.800
You ever been
totally without fear?

01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:18.677
- No.

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:24.850
- That's the second difference
between us.

01:24:24.976 --> 01:24:26.935
I have the courage
to die for my beliefs

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:30.731
because I know where I'm going.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:33.108
You have the courage
to die for your beliefs?

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.280
- I guess so, you know,
if I had to.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:41.742
- I don't think you do.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.079
But I figured out

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:48.165
I was the last person
that should die.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:50.501
- Joe.

01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:57.633
Read the marked passage.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.691
- "The man
that committeth adultery

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:19.905
"with another man's wife,

01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:23.659
the adulterer and the adulteress
shall surely be put to death."

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.748
But, Joe,
what about the New Testament?

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.917
Doesn't Jesus say
about an adulteress,

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:34.419
"He who is without sin
amongst you,

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:36.004
let him cast a stone at her?"

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.340
- That's right, and no one did,

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:42.261
because no one was without sin.

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:43.929
And Jesus said to the woman,

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:46.223
"Neither do I condemn thee.

01:25:46.349 --> 01:25:48.392
Now go and sin no more."

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:49.726
- Right.

01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:57.484
- Are you prepared
to sin no more?

01:26:00.363 --> 01:26:02.114
Is Shana?

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:13.208
I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.585
And if I say
I'm gonna do something,

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.170
you better believe I will.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.218
Get out.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:37.900
- Listen, Gavin.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.235
For God's sake,
just come in here.

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.778
I promise I can help you.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:43.572
- You think I want this, man?

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.781
- We just got five minutes left.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:46.366
Please let me...

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:54.791
Excuse me.

01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:02.341
If you were gonna kill someone

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.675
that had an affair
with your wife

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:05.427
and you were doing it this way,
what would you want?

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.095
- Gavin!

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.513
Get down from there, man!

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.015
- I'd want to watch him.

01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:11.183
- Me too.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.893
I think I just saw something
on the ninth floor

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.102
at the Crescent Hotel.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.604
- What are you doing?

01:27:20.693 --> 01:27:21.735
- Look, for God's sake, Gavin,

01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:23.028
please just come in here.

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:24.279
Let me help you.

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.572
- There's nothing you can do.

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:30.452
- Hi. This is Shana.
Please leave a message.

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.120
Beep!

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.248
- Fuck.

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:45.425
Shana.

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:46.843
- You know how I said
I had the courage

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.887
to die for my beliefs
but you didn't?

01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:49.930
- Yeah.

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:51.431
- You disagreed.

01:27:51.557 --> 01:27:52.641
- Yeah.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:54.226
- You still think you have
the courage?

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:55.978
- Yeah, Joe,
but what does that matter?

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.104
- Yeah, will let me tell you

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.230
what the situation is here,
Gavin.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:02.150
See, I've decided I'm more
of an Old Testament sort of guy.

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.945
But I am willing to compromise.

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:09.366
Only one of you
has to die today.

01:28:09.492 --> 01:28:12.160
I have Shana
right in front of me,

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.622
and I have my gun
pointed at her head.

01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:16.748
- Listen, Joe, whatever-

01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:18.750
- Stop.
Stop.

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:23.922
Go to the Tamlacker Building.

01:28:24.048 --> 01:28:27.092
There's a door around back.

01:28:27.218 --> 01:28:31.013
Take the staircase
all the way up to the top.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.974
On the roof,
you'll find a utility shed.

01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:40.564
You get on the ledge
in front of it.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.569
You stand there and think.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.240
At noon, you jump,
or I put a bullet in her head.

01:28:50.366 --> 01:28:53.827
Maybe you'll find God.

01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:55.620
- What in the hell
is wrong with you?

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:58.123
Don't you realize if you had
told me this from the start,

01:28:58.249 --> 01:28:59.166
I could've found him?

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:00.292
I could've done something.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:01.543
- He would've killed her.

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:04.546
- How do you know he's even
capable of killing her?

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:07.215
You don't even know
what you're capable of.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:10.344
I mean, would you kill your mom
in order to save your father

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.722
or kill one of your kids
in order to save another kid?

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:16.266
These are things
that we cannot know.

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:19.770
- I know what he's capable of,
Hollis.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:22.022
I saw it in his eyes.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:24.733
- Look, man, I am not gonna
blow smoke up your ass.

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:28.278
You are in a terrible dilemma.

01:29:28.404 --> 01:29:30.113
But I swear to you,
if I was in your place-

01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:31.823
- Who do your kids
think their dad is?

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:33.575
- Gavin-
- You get over it for them.

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.285
- Gavin, please.
Please just come in here-

01:29:35.411 --> 01:29:37.496
- Where's your faith now?

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:39.081
Your wife says she loves you

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:42.334
and she did this for you, right?

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.752
- Why can't you have faith
in that?

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.254
- Why don't you just mind
your own fuckin' business?

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.633
Listen, man,
if you do this to me,

01:29:49.759 --> 01:29:52.010
I'm gonna carry this shit
the rest of my life.

01:29:52.136 --> 01:29:53.804
- Not if you do
what I want you to do.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.222
- Tell Shana-
- I will not do it.

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:56.515
I will not do it.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.934
If you got somethin'
that you need to tell her,

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.229
you climb your ass in here,
you tell her yourself!

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:03.647
You're always so rational.

01:30:03.773 --> 01:30:05.649
I mean, does this sound
rational to you?

01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:06.775
- Whoa! Get out of here!

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:07.901
- I mean, think about it.

01:30:08.027 --> 01:30:12.072
What makes her life
more valuable than yours?

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.324
Please.

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:17.953
Gavin.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.830
Just come here.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:22.541
Just come here, man.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.419
Now, Gavin, please.

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:32.634
Gavin, please come here.

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.977
Just come here, man.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:45.188
- Look, I feel like
I've gotten to know you.

01:30:45.314 --> 01:30:47.482
And I like you, and I'm sorry
I'm gonna have to do this.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:48.692
- Please.

01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:49.985
- But if you were standing
where I am

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.862
and your wife or any one
of your kids had a gun

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:53.447
to his or her head,

01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:55.949
this time,
you did have time to think,

01:30:56.075 --> 01:30:58.326
could anyone on Earth
stop you from jumping?

01:30:58.453 --> 01:30:59.911
- I'm begging you.
Please don't do this.

01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:01.204
- Here's what I want you to do.

01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:02.789
- Gavin, please don't do this.

01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:04.791
- I never told Shana
I loved her.

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:07.502
You tell her for me.
- I will not do it.

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:10.338
- Yes, you will.

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:11.798
Then you go home, okay?

01:31:11.924 --> 01:31:13.508
- Gavin, don't you do this.

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.969
Please, Gavin.

01:31:16.095 --> 01:31:17.137
- Fuck.
Here.

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:19.306
- Gavin, please!

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:47.959
- Freeze.
Freeze!

01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:50.086
On the ground, now.
Drop it.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:20.825
- Do you have anyone
to stay with?

01:32:23.746 --> 01:32:26.373
- I think I'll try being alone
for a while.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:29.417
Never really done that.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.420
- Well, at least for tonight,
like, a friend?

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:38.468
- I guess I'll find out.

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:46.184
- Look, not that I imagine
you're doubting it,

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:50.188
but he did want me
to tell you that...

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:52.774
he loved you.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.824
- Thank you.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.682
Both:
Daddy!

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.352
- They heard
what happened today.

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:35.979
The guy on the-

01:35:36.105 --> 01:35:38.273
- It was on the TV?

01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:42.736
- I'm really sorry.

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:46.239
- It's okay.

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.286
Life goes on.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:03.298
- So shall we say grace?

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.842
- No, not tonight.

01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:08.720
We don't say grace tonight,
okay?

01:36:08.846 --> 01:36:11.014
- Why not?

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:15.059
- Because I'm your father,
and I said so, okay?

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:16.936
- Okay.

01:36:20.232 --> 01:36:22.275
- Okay?

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.113
- Okay.

01:36:30.826 --> 01:36:37.832
- Let's eat.

01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:48.009
