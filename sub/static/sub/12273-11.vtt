00:04.705 --> 00:06.707
(car horn honking)

00:12.680 --> 00:14.048
* That's life

00:14.082 --> 00:16.050
* That's life *

00:16.084 --> 00:18.619
* That's what all
the people say *

00:19.653 --> 00:23.524
* You're riding high in April

00:23.557 --> 00:25.793
* Shot down in May

00:25.826 --> 00:29.130
* But I know I'm gonna change

00:29.163 --> 00:31.665
* That tune

00:31.699 --> 00:34.535
* When I'm back on top

00:34.568 --> 00:36.737
* Back on top in June

00:36.770 --> 00:39.573
* I said that's life

00:39.607 --> 00:41.809
* That's life *

00:41.842 --> 00:46.514
* And as funny as it may seem

00:46.547 --> 00:48.682
* Some people get their kicks

00:48.716 --> 00:52.320
* Stomping on a dream

00:52.353 --> 00:53.854
* But I don't let it

00:53.887 --> 00:57.525
* Let it get me down

00:57.558 --> 01:00.228
* 'Cause this fine old world

01:00.261 --> 01:02.630
* It keeps spinning round

01:02.663 --> 01:06.334
* I've been a puppet, a pauper

01:06.367 --> 01:07.535
* A pirate, a poet

01:07.568 --> 01:10.671
* A pawn and a king

01:10.704 --> 01:13.774
* I've been up and down
and over and out *

01:13.807 --> 01:14.775
(laughs)

01:14.808 --> 01:16.810
* I know one thing

01:16.844 --> 01:21.182
* Each time I find myself

01:21.215 --> 01:23.651
* Flat on my face

01:23.684 --> 01:26.154
* I pick myself up

01:26.187 --> 01:29.657
* And get back in the race

01:29.690 --> 01:31.292
* That's life...

01:31.325 --> 01:32.593
HAWKES:
Ouch.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.128
That had to hurt.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.429
Not as bad

01:35.463 --> 01:36.697
as his bill
for his time.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.498
(chuckles)

01:40.768 --> 01:42.270
Who's the vic?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.272
Name's Manny Hinde,
attorney-at-law.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.773
You probably heard
his radio commercial.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.475
"Had an accident?

01:47.508 --> 01:48.642
Hurt on the job?"

01:48.676 --> 01:50.178
"Call the legal mind
of Manny Hinde."

01:50.211 --> 01:52.213
Oh.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.582
Secretary
found him

01:54.615 --> 01:56.150
when she came in this morning.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.618
Said that he stayed
late last night

01:57.651 --> 01:59.453
to work on a
bunch of briefs.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.894
Through and through.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.631
Fired at point-blank range.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.566
Body temp

02:12.600 --> 02:14.768
suggests TOD
was around midnight.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.716
Outside of where it
impacted the glass,

02:28.749 --> 02:31.452
I'm not seeing any ballistic
striae on its surface.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.853
LOVATO:
So we're not talking

02:32.886 --> 02:34.788
about your average gat.
No.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.625
But whatever it was...

02:37.658 --> 02:41.795
somebody clearly used it to blow
the legal mind of Manny Hinde.

03:03.551 --> 03:07.688
* Out here in the fields

03:07.721 --> 03:11.825
* I fight for my meals

03:11.859 --> 03:16.430
* I get my back into my living

03:18.866 --> 03:24.705
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.777
(siren wails, car horn honks)

03:29.810 --> 03:30.744
(camera shutter clicking)

03:55.303 --> 03:57.004
Any signs of forced entry?

03:57.037 --> 03:57.971
None whatsoever.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.374
Then Manny Hinde
might have known his killer.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.509
What about family?

04:01.542 --> 04:02.876
Divorced twice.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.545
Both of his exes
live out of state.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.746
No kids.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.282
His secretary says he spent
half his life in the office,

04:08.316 --> 04:09.817
the other half in court.
Any idea

04:09.850 --> 04:11.619
what kind of cases
he was working?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.454
He was counsel to 17 plaintiffs.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.722
Six traffic
accidents,

04:14.755 --> 04:16.390
eight worker comps,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.392
two slip-and-falls
and a bad lip enhancement.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.860
Though I have yet
to see a good one.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.862
HAWKES: Sounds like
there could be

04:21.894 --> 04:23.831
any number of defendants who
didn't appreciate Manny's work.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.866
I sent a copy of the case files
to your office.

04:25.899 --> 04:26.834
Good.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.935
It could help us figure out

04:27.968 --> 04:30.838
who chased this ambulance chaser
into an early grave.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.710
REPORTER (on TV): Police say
they have no leads at this stage

04:36.744 --> 04:38.379
and they're appealing
for help from the public.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.913
Hey, I thought we were
having lunch together.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.415
Yeah, sorry, me too, babe.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.484
But Mac's got me poring
over Manny Hinde's

04:43.517 --> 04:44.652
case files.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.986
Which I actually like to call

04:46.019 --> 04:48.356
"50 Shades of Sleazebag."

04:48.389 --> 04:49.490
It's better than running
ballistics

04:49.523 --> 04:50.891
on a bullet
with no ballistics.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.960
How you supposed
to do that?
Exactly.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.662
MAN: Hey, will you
turn that up?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.764
WOMAN: A million dollars.
A million!

04:56.797 --> 04:58.999
You telling me it wouldn't
knock you out cold to have

04:59.032 --> 05:00.834
somebody hit you
with that kind of lettuce?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.371
REPORTER: So far, over the last
24 hours, ten individuals

05:03.404 --> 05:05.038
across New York City have
received cashier's checks

05:05.072 --> 05:08.075
from an anonymous donor
for a million dollars apiece.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.944
Officials at First Federation
Bank, where the checks

05:10.978 --> 05:12.946
were processed,
had no comment on the identity

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
of the generous benefactor

05:14.848 --> 05:16.950
people are now
simply referring to as

05:16.984 --> 05:18.486
the "Guardian Angel."

05:18.519 --> 05:20.488
The Guardian Angel?

05:20.521 --> 05:21.589
Can I get a number
on this guy?

05:21.622 --> 05:22.856
I want to give
him our address.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.957
REPORTER:
...every borough across town.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.659
And while none

05:25.693 --> 05:27.060
of the random recipients claim
to have any clue

05:27.094 --> 05:29.363
about why they've been
given a million in cash,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.098
it's clearly had
a very big impact.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.601
MAN: Uh, I'm gonna get
out of the projects.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.536
I'm gonna go back to school.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.773
Um, I'm gonna do everything
my mother dreamed I would.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.775
REPORTER: Flores, a fast-food
restaurant employee...

05:41.809 --> 05:44.111
Wow. What kind of person
gives that type of coin away

05:44.144 --> 05:45.679
to someone they don't even know?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.081
Somebody who wants to feel good,
I would imagine.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.518
...an investment planner,
a songwriter,

05:50.551 --> 05:51.585
and a retired veteran.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.920
DANVILLE:
Borrow your pen?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.555
Also, no one has been able
to figure out

05:54.588 --> 05:55.689
what exactly these folks have
in common,

05:55.723 --> 05:57.458
aside from their newfound wealth

05:57.491 --> 05:58.992
and their obvious joy,
and also...

05:59.026 --> 06:01.061
You know, the
most free money

06:01.094 --> 06:02.996
I ever got was $1.75
in extra change

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
from that vending machine.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.066
You should give it back.
(laughs)

06:06.099 --> 06:07.100
Seriously?
(phone ringing)

06:07.134 --> 06:08.936
Absolutely.
(chuckles)

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
Jo Danville.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.743
Okay, on our way.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.778
All right, let's
go work, Adam.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.813
You can earn back that
snack machine bonus.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.424
FLACK:
Name is
Justin VanderHeyden.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.626
23 years old,
mechanical engineer.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.061
Graduated with honors last year

06:34.094 --> 06:35.996
from the Brooklyn
University of Science.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.565
Sounds like a bright kid.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.867
Never got less than an "A"
according to his parents.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.002
Nothing more than jury duty
according to his record.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.705
Then how'd he end up here?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.675
Landlord came by around noon
looking for the rent.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.776
Said the door was open.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.977
He found Justin dead
on the floor.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.178
No signs of breaking
and entering.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.646
Looks like a
single round.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.982
Penetrating trauma
to the heart,

06:55.015 --> 06:57.685
judging by the blood loss.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.787
Liver temp...

06:59.820 --> 07:02.656
puts the time of death
about 10:00 last night.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.498
Okay, so we got two computer
speakers, a mouse pad

07:10.531 --> 07:12.533
and no computer.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.034
So we could still be
looking at burglary,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.903
even without the B and E.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.071
Maybe Justin let
the wrong person in.

07:20.908 --> 07:24.011
Hey, Jo, check this out.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.848
This table's covered with
some kind of powdered metal.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.587
Not totally covered.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.856
Sometimes the biggest clue
is the one that's missing.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.061
(car horn blares)

07:42.262 --> 07:45.132
*

07:52.139 --> 07:54.107
LINDSAY:
So what would you do

07:54.141 --> 07:55.976
in that position?

07:56.009 --> 08:00.080
If somebody gave me
a million bucks?

08:00.113 --> 08:03.517
Hmm. I'd probably use it
to help underprivileged youth.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.519
Aw.
Or buy a Tesla.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.054
(chuckles)

08:12.726 --> 08:14.862
(buzzing)

08:16.329 --> 08:18.899
(beeps)

08:32.212 --> 08:33.547
Huh.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.881
That's weird.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.082
What?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.784
These metal fragments
I collected

08:37.818 --> 08:39.119
from Manny Hinde's desk

08:39.152 --> 08:40.921
are testing positive
for gunshot residue.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.823
But they're made

08:42.856 --> 08:45.125
of some kind of metal
and epoxy resin

08:45.158 --> 08:47.661
that I've never seen
on any weapon before.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.829
Yeah, then we're
in the exact same boat.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.031
'Cause I can't tell
Mac anything more

08:51.064 --> 08:53.667
about what fired this bullet
than you can.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.669

nothing of importance *

09:27.167 --> 09:32.973
* No, your daddy taught you
nothing you could learn *

09:33.006 --> 09:39.046
* You had your sisters weighing
on your pockets... *

09:39.079 --> 09:41.081
REPORTER:
But it wasn't until the East
Village couple found a gift

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
from the Guardian Angel
that they realized

09:43.183 --> 09:44.818
just how lucky they were.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.855
But now the three of us
are gonna be just fine.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.190
The three of us?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.326
I'm gonna be a father?
Yeah.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.928
Okay, people.

These bodies aren't gonna
autopsy themselves.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.384
Looks like a busy
day down here.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.387
That's what I get
for taking yesterday off.
Well, I hope

10:54.421 --> 10:56.389
you spent it at least relaxing.
(yawns)

10:56.423 --> 10:57.891
I think I stopped relaxing

10:57.925 --> 10:59.793
during my first year
of med school.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.932
So, what can you tell us
about Justin VanderHeyden?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.433
COD was
catastrophic injury

11:06.466 --> 11:09.136
to the heart
due to gunshot wound.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.039
The bullet was lodged
in his pulmonary artery,

11:12.072 --> 11:14.742
where it no doubt killed
young Justin instantly.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.176
But I'm afraid that wasn't

11:16.209 --> 11:19.279
my most unsettling discovery.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.221
There's no striae of any kind.
Uh-huh.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.323
It's just like the other one.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.293
The bullet Sid pulled
from Justin VanderHeyden's heart

11:33.326 --> 11:37.197
is identical to the
round fired through
Manny Hinde's head.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.199
When did you estimate
Justin's TOD?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.234
Around 10:00 p.m.
HAWKES:
And Manny died

11:41.268 --> 11:43.170
a couple of hours later
at midnight.
So what's

11:43.203 --> 11:44.938
the connection between
a young engineer

11:44.972 --> 11:46.073
and an ambulance chaser?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.274
They were both murdered

11:47.307 --> 11:49.176
with the exact same weapon.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.383
*
(siren wailing in distance)

11:58.551 --> 12:01.521
Despite the kinds of cases
Manny Hinde handles,

12:01.554 --> 12:03.190
there haven't been
any countersuits

12:03.223 --> 12:05.258
filed against him in
the past five years

12:05.292 --> 12:07.427
or a single
complaint logged

12:07.460 --> 12:10.263
with the New York Bar.
And we didn't find anyone

12:10.297 --> 12:12.766
who didn't like
Justin VanderHeyden.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
So whatever
he was working on,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.303
he didn't have to worry
about his reputation.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.539
What about something
that ties Justin
directly to Manny?
Mm-mm.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.541
Different ages,
different walks of life,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.244
live on completely
separate sides of the city.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.814
Nothing to indicate
these two ever crossed paths.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.816
Then why are
these two men dead

12:28.849 --> 12:32.152
at the hands of
the same killer?

12:32.185 --> 12:35.222
ROSS (chuckles):
I miss you more.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.224
I do. Well, it is possible.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.059
I'm bigger than you, okay?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.961
It means I'm physically capable

12:40.994 --> 12:43.997
of missing you
in larger quantities.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.432
It's a scientific fact.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.867
It is. Yeah.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.368
Ooh. What? Wow.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.903
You like that,
do you?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.438
You like that
I'm a scientist?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.840
Do you? Yeah?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.107
I think it turns you on.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.344
Well, maybe I'll come over later
and put on my lab coat and...

12:57.377 --> 13:00.280
(clears throat)
Oh! Oh. Bye.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.849
Uh...

13:01.882 --> 13:02.950
Oh, God.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.251
Uh, you guys are

13:04.284 --> 13:06.119
probably wondering
why I'm on my phone.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.355
Yeah, uh, that thought
did cross our mind.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.857
Well,

13:09.890 --> 13:12.592
unfortunately,
Justin VanderHeyden, uh,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.394
had pass code protection,

13:14.427 --> 13:16.296
so I'm having to hack
into his phone.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.399
And in the meantime?
In the meantime, yeah...

13:19.432 --> 13:20.367
okay, um...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.236
This is Michelle. Yeah,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.272
she's a musician.
Um, a-actually,

13:25.305 --> 13:27.340
she's a waitress, but
one day she's gonna be famous,

13:27.374 --> 13:28.942
I know it,
she's just so beautiful.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.443
I can see that.
I know,
but have you

13:30.477 --> 13:32.145
ever met someone
that just makes you

13:32.179 --> 13:33.446
completely forget
about everything in your life

13:33.480 --> 13:34.915
before you met them?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.383
Adam.
Yeah?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.350
(beeping)
Oh, God.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.886
Thank you.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.520
Check Justin's
GPS records.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.390
Maybe they can
tell us where he was
before he was killed.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.425
Now.
Okay.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.627
Here we go.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.629
He was around the Bronx

13:49.662 --> 13:51.531
approximately 7:30 p.m.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.967
Triborough Club.
Have you ever heard of it?

13:54.001 --> 13:54.968
It's an upscale place.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.170
A lot of younger, hipper kids.
You definitely

13:57.204 --> 13:59.639
go there to be seen.
All right, then
listen to me carefully.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.608
Stay off your phone and on his.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.878
Go through Justin's
contacts, calendar,

14:04.912 --> 14:06.346
text messages, call records,

14:06.379 --> 14:07.547
all of it.
Yes, sir.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.581
And, Jo.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.317
Get on the horn
with Flack.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.385
He and Lovato should
check with the
Triborough Club

14:12.419 --> 14:14.354
for any possible witnesses

14:14.387 --> 14:15.255
or surveillance.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.257
If Justin was there that soon

14:17.290 --> 14:19.192
before he was killed...

14:19.226 --> 14:21.528
his killer might have
been there with him.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.366
(siren wailing in distance)

14:28.201 --> 14:30.437
FLACK:
I can't believe
not one bartender or server

14:30.470 --> 14:33.173
remembered seeing Justin
VanderHeyden in that club.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.607
I asked every single
last one of them,

14:34.641 --> 14:37.077
and all we have to go on
is a surveillance video

14:37.110 --> 14:38.511
they gave us
of the freak show outside.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.381
Tell you what, you would
not catch me dead in a place

14:41.414 --> 14:43.250
like the Triborough.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.684
Let me guess.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.920
You prefer Irish pubs.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.256
Why? Because you prefer
salsa dancing?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.958
Touché.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.295
What are you into?
Why, so you
can tease me?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.529
No.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.032
Come on, I'm curious.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.568
I won't bust on
you, I promise.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.971
Okay.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.607
But I'm trusting you
with this, okay?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.542
Two words:

15:09.576 --> 15:11.278
Ping-Pong.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.014
Ping-Pong?

15:14.047 --> 15:16.083
I know. I didn't think
I'd be into it, either,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.317
but there's
this new place that

15:17.350 --> 15:19.186
opened up in SoHo a
couple of months back.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.054
I walked into it on a
canvass-- it's awesome.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.555
You can rent tables
by the hour.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.457
They got a full bar.
They even have coaches

15:24.491 --> 15:26.526
walking around to help you
with your game.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.360
Of Ping-Pong?

15:27.394 --> 15:29.129
When was the last time
you played?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.430
I don't know,
probably seventh grade.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.132
Then you should know
what I'm talking about.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.368
But in case you forgot,
I will happily reintroduce you

15:35.402 --> 15:37.404
to the pleasures of Ping-Pong--
unless, of course,

15:37.437 --> 15:39.372
you're scared
I'm gonna beat you.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.076
I think I can hold my own.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.577
Oh, all right, then.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.414
So, what do you say
we go tonight after work?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
First round's on me.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.618
All right.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.186
Yeah.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.554
I'm game.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.260
Whoa.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.062
We got VanderHeyden
entering the club.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.263
What time?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.266
7:50.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.468
Okay. Let's see if
we can run it forward

16:08.501 --> 16:10.103
and catch him on the exit.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.306
There.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.474
8:45.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.311
See him coming
back out?

16:18.345 --> 16:19.512
And he's with somebody else.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.148
Can't see his face.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.417
Male, approximately
six foot, blond hair,

16:24.451 --> 16:25.785
muscular build.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.320
Doesn't look like
our attorney.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.489
But we've had no sign
of him anywhere else.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.525
Then who is this guy?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.662
ROSS: His name is Andy Stein,

16:35.695 --> 16:38.331
and he's the founder of a
company called Intellifund.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.633
A venture capital firm.
Yeah, and after I

16:40.667 --> 16:42.335
unlocked the pass code
to Justin's phone,

16:42.369 --> 16:44.571
I found Stein in the calendar.
Now, get this.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.306
They were scheduled to meet
at the Triborough Club

16:46.339 --> 16:49.376
at 8:00 p.m.
the night he was killed.
Then he could know

16:49.409 --> 16:50.677
something about
what happened to Justin.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.445
And based
on what I learned

16:52.479 --> 16:54.681
about this guy,
that's just the start of it.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.649
TAYLOR:
You have an interest

16:56.683 --> 17:00.420
in new and developing
technologies, Mr. Stein?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.721
I do, indeed.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.557
We understand you were
supposed to hear a pitch

17:04.590 --> 17:07.460
the night before last
from Justin VanderHeyden.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.396
I meet with a lot
of B.U.S. graduates.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.632
Yeah, we've seen
the list of civil complaints

17:12.665 --> 17:16.069
from young innovators
whose ideas you've
already stolen.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.538
Or did you forget
to mention to Justin

17:18.570 --> 17:20.307
that you're currently
being indicted

17:20.339 --> 17:22.608
on six counts of intellectual
property theft?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.477
I didn't take anything
from anybody.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.648
What about Justin's life?

17:29.849 --> 17:33.086
He was murdered
a few hours after

17:33.120 --> 17:34.387
leaving the Triborough Club

17:34.421 --> 17:38.625
with a man who closely
matches your description.
No, no, no,

17:38.658 --> 17:39.659
that's not possible.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.827
DANVILLE:
You must've been
awfully desperate

17:40.860 --> 17:44.331
to get your hands on
whatever he was working on.
N-No.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.698
No, you... you don't understand.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.600
That's not possible,
because I never actually

17:47.634 --> 17:49.536
met the kid.
We have you

17:49.569 --> 17:51.838
on surveillance video
entering the Triborough Club...

17:51.871 --> 17:53.740
at 8:05 that night.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.544
Yes, that's right,
because I was there; he wasn't.

17:57.577 --> 18:02.382
I sat around in that bar
for the better part of an hour.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.553
I even ordered myself some
foo-foo watered-down drink.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.356
This kid never showed up.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.891
DANVILLE:
And then what?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.893
STEIN:
I left.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.296
By myself.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.831
I didn't kill anybody.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.436
What about Manny Hinde?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.439
Danny find some way
to connect him to Andy Stein?

18:26.473 --> 18:27.407
Not one. Plus,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.609
we still can't prove
it's Stein in the video

18:29.642 --> 18:30.910
leaving that club
with Justin.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.548
And once Flack went back
to take another look,

18:35.582 --> 18:37.884
we couldn't
see him exit at all.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.320
So without some firm science,

18:40.353 --> 18:43.590
we can't put that guy
at either crime scene.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.426
(Hawkes laughs)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.361
I think I may have
just figured out what

18:48.395 --> 18:49.462
Justin VanderHeyden
was working on.

18:49.496 --> 18:53.500
What's that?
Same thing that killed him.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.273
Justin VanderHeyden

19:00.307 --> 19:01.708
printed a gun.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.810
He what?
Yeah.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.278
It's called 3-D metal printing,

19:05.312 --> 19:07.514
and it works just like
any ordinary printer,

19:07.547 --> 19:10.517
but instead of using ink
to produce an image...
TAYLOR: It uses

19:10.550 --> 19:12.385
powdered metals.
Yes.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.853
Mixed with steel epoxy resin

19:13.886 --> 19:15.488
to create multiple layers

19:15.522 --> 19:16.989
of a three-dimensional object.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.393
Okay, I'm not sure I
even want to try to wrap
my brain around that.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.562
Think about it like this.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.497
Little by little,

19:24.531 --> 19:25.732
each layer is

19:25.765 --> 19:27.600
fused together...

19:27.634 --> 19:29.602
by a laser heat source

19:29.636 --> 19:32.405
until the object is made whole.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.806
TAYLOR:
3-D printing's

19:33.840 --> 19:35.708
already had
revolutionary applications

19:35.742 --> 19:38.345
in the automotive
and biotech fields.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.679
Yeah, you can print anything

19:39.712 --> 19:41.614
from car parts
to bone replacements.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.550
Yeah, okay, but a gun?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.552
How did he pull that off?

19:45.585 --> 19:47.754
I got to admit, it wasn't easy.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.290
I found a series of proprietary

19:50.323 --> 19:52.725
algorithmic programming files
backed up

19:52.759 --> 19:56.296
on the Zip drive that
Justin kept on his key chain.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.365
Now, at first,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.400
it just looked like
a bunch of foreign language.

20:04.937 --> 20:09.442
Until I saw a few words
that I recognized.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.310
When I put

20:10.343 --> 20:12.712
all that information
together, along with

20:12.745 --> 20:14.781
the trace swabs
and dust void measurements

20:14.814 --> 20:16.283
from Justin's workshop,

20:16.316 --> 20:19.452
I got a better idea
of what he was up to.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.554
Once he designed
the software to drive it,

20:21.588 --> 20:24.724
the parts and supplies
needed to print a gun

20:24.757 --> 20:26.959
were available online and
at the local hardware store.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.762
All he had to do was hit
Command-P, then sit back

20:29.796 --> 20:31.631
and watch.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.801
*

20:39.739 --> 20:40.873
His printer was probably

20:40.907 --> 20:42.609
a little more
homegrown than ours,

20:42.642 --> 20:44.511
but the software that ran it

20:44.544 --> 20:46.813
(beep)
gave us the same end result.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.053
You've got to be kidding me.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.922
I wish I was.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.824
It's your basic .38,

20:57.857 --> 21:00.793
printed whole,
with all moving parts.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.762
(chuckles quietly)

21:02.795 --> 21:04.831
No markings, no serial numbers,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.666
no barrel boring.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.535
That explains the complete lack
of ballistics.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.769
Guns are

21:09.802 --> 21:10.870
dangerous enough
in the wrong hands.

21:10.903 --> 21:11.871
Now we have to worry

21:11.904 --> 21:13.740
about people being able
to print them at home.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.807
Without a permit.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.777
This is one I almost wish
you hadn't figured out.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.614
Well, you know
what they say?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.983
Every act of creation is
an act of destruction.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.887
A printable gun
definitely proves that theory.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.789
But we still need to figure out

21:29.822 --> 21:31.858
who took two lives
with one of them.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.464
...where sources tell us
he is about

21:37.497 --> 21:39.832
to reveal the identity
of the Guardian Angel--

21:39.866 --> 21:41.768
the mysterious donor

21:41.801 --> 21:44.937
who has given $1 million
to ten random people.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.473
Oh, and it looks like

21:46.506 --> 21:48.975
Mr. Kemp is making his way
to the podium right now.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.110
(applause)

21:51.143 --> 21:53.546
Thank you. Thank you.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.782
I know there's been a lot
of speculation swirling

21:55.815 --> 21:59.819
about this Guardian Angel
character.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.521
And frankly,
a lot of people familiar

22:01.554 --> 22:04.391
with my philanthropic side
have been asking if it's me.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.660
So I thought it was time
I gave you an answer to that.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.730
Yes, I am the Guardian Angel.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.765
(applause and cheering)

22:13.833 --> 22:16.836
The fact is, I take a lot
of heat in this town,

22:16.869 --> 22:20.373
thanks to the properties
I own and the plans I have,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.375
but I love New York.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.712
So, if I can make this kind
of a difference in the lives

22:25.745 --> 22:27.414
of ten average people,

22:27.447 --> 22:30.082
then hell, maybe I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.419
(applause, cheering
and chatter)

22:32.452 --> 22:34.821
Oh, so that's
the Guardian Angel.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.922
So he says.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.491
Yeah, ten million bucks
is chump change for that guy.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.627
Yeah, right? He probably
spends that on hair gel.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.128
DANVILLE:
I don't know.
Feels more like

22:42.161 --> 22:44.030
strategy to me than charity.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.832
You think?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.000
(crowd chatter, Kemp laughs)

22:48.034 --> 22:50.169
These things are never
how they look.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.638
REPORTER:
Well, there you have it.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.939
The Guardian Angel
has been revealed.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.173
Detective?
Thank you.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.676
Let's go back to David
and Devon in the studio.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.844
DEVON:
Great reporting. Such good news.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.879
So, tell us,
what's it like down there?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.948
REPORTER:
Well, it's very exciting
down here.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.083
Everyone thought
it might be Kemp,

23:04.116 --> 23:06.719
but no one really thought
he was that generous.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.755
*

23:35.682 --> 23:37.684
(computer chirping)

23:47.159 --> 23:49.161
(gunshot)

23:59.839 --> 24:04.010
(debris clinking)

24:04.043 --> 24:06.479
LINDSAY:
Look familiar?

24:06.513 --> 24:08.180
That's part of what's left

24:08.214 --> 24:10.917
of the printed revolver
I just test-fired in Ballistics.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.552
And these are
the metal fragments

24:12.585 --> 24:14.053
I collected
from Manny Hinde's office.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.724
They're the same.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.793
Lindsay, when
did the gun fail?

24:20.827 --> 24:21.761
On the second round.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.795
HAWKES:
Which is consistent

24:22.829 --> 24:23.930
with my analysis

24:23.963 --> 24:25.932
of soft metal
and epoxy construction.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.201
Okay, the gun Justin made
must have been a prototype.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.037
It would have had
to have been kiln-tempered

24:31.070 --> 24:32.004
at high heat
for a lengthy

24:32.038 --> 24:34.006
period before
it would even have a chance

24:34.040 --> 24:36.008
of being structurally
sound enough to fire.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.744
But our killer didn't know that.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.646
(grunts)

24:39.679 --> 24:43.115
We know the first round
killed Justin on impact.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.885
The second round did more
than just kill Manny Hinde.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.087
(groaning)

24:48.120 --> 24:51.758
It would have exploded and very
likely injured the shooter.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.259
Reach out to every

24:53.292 --> 24:55.261
E.R. in town,
check reports

24:55.294 --> 24:56.996
of anything that looks
like a shrapnel injury.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.598
Got it.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.653
DANNY:
Okay, will you let me know

25:20.687 --> 25:22.021
if you see a patient
with those kind of injuries?

25:22.054 --> 25:23.890
Fantastic.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.157
(phone ringing)

25:25.191 --> 25:27.960
Hi, this is Detective Lindsay
Messer with the NYPD Crime Lab.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.162
Could I please speak to an
emergency room physician?

25:56.723 --> 25:59.158
That was at about what time?
(snaps fingers)

26:01.393 --> 26:04.363
Okay, and were the
injuries serious?

26:04.396 --> 26:07.199
And did he say how it happened?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.936
Okay, I'm gonna need
that patient's name.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.142
Boom.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.125
(computer chirping)

26:35.695 --> 26:37.163
Mac, we checked with
17 area hospitals.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.131
I think we finally got
a lead on our perp.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.033
Andy Lewis.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.268
How does he do that?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.203
Wasn't our other suspect
named Andy, too?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.272
Andy Stein,
venture capitalist,

26:46.305 --> 26:49.141
but that shyster's a saint
compared to Andy Lewis.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.342
DANNY
"B and E, burglary."

26:50.376 --> 26:51.844
Just finished
a three-year stint

26:51.878 --> 26:53.145
for assault
with a deadly weapon.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.413
LINDSAY:
Well, looks like

26:54.446 --> 26:56.048
a deadly weapon
just assaulted him back.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.316
I checked with the E.R. doctor.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.152
He has first degree burns on his
fingers, multiple lacerations

27:00.186 --> 27:01.654
on his face.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.222
Well, shouldn't be hard
to spot once we find him.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.858
We just did.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.194
(computer trilling)

27:11.063 --> 27:12.298
(horns honking)

27:12.331 --> 27:14.100
(siren blaring)

27:14.133 --> 27:16.135
(door creaking)

27:20.472 --> 27:22.675
(machine whirring)

27:46.799 --> 27:48.434
(power whirring down)

27:48.467 --> 27:50.703
TAYLOR:
Andy Lewis, NYPD.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.039
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.277
(grunting)

28:32.912 --> 28:35.748
(panting)

28:50.930 --> 28:52.398
(grunts)

28:53.399 --> 28:54.300
(grunts)

28:57.103 --> 28:59.238
(grunting)

28:59.271 --> 29:01.140
(groaning)

29:02.842 --> 29:05.377
(groaning)

29:06.412 --> 29:09.081
(sighs)

29:09.115 --> 29:12.051
Man, he looks
tired, huh?

29:16.255 --> 29:19.358
You ever see the movie North
by Northwest, Mr. Lewis?

29:19.391 --> 29:21.160
I don't get out much.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.161
I'm sure that's true,

29:22.194 --> 29:24.296
considering all the time
you've spent in lockup.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.898
It was a great flick.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.399
Cary Grant

29:27.433 --> 29:30.102
plays an ad exec who gets
mistaken for someone else,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.338
and it just completely
turns his life upside down.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.241
(laughs)
Kind of like

29:35.274 --> 29:37.176
Justin VanderHeyden.

29:37.209 --> 29:40.346
Only his life was ended,

29:40.379 --> 29:42.882
and you're the one
that got mistaken.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.917
Justin had an
8:00 meeting

29:44.951 --> 29:46.485
scheduled
with a venture capitalist

29:46.518 --> 29:48.120
at the Triborough Club.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.856
He had a big idea
that needed funding.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.958
And he was certain
that Andy Stein was the guy

29:51.991 --> 29:53.225
to make that happen.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.394
TAYLOR:
Trouble is,
Justin was excited,

29:55.427 --> 29:57.596
so he got there a little earlier
than he should have,

29:57.629 --> 30:00.066
and Andy Stein
hadn't arrived yet.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.068
DANVILLE:
But Andy Lewis had.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.836
(dance music plays,
crowd chatter)

30:07.907 --> 30:08.340
Andy?

30:08.374 --> 30:10.309
Yeah?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.343
Hi. I'm Justin.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.012
Um, it's so nice to meet you.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.246
And I know
you're a very busy man,

30:14.280 --> 30:17.616
but I think you're really gonna
like what I've come up with.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.520
I'd like to introduce you
to the printable gun.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.555
I had no freakin' idea
who he was.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.591
DANVILLE:
No, you probably had

30:25.624 --> 30:27.293
other things on your mind.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.295
Like the fact
that Manny Hinde slept

30:29.328 --> 30:31.297
with your wife Molly
while you were in prison.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.065
How the hell do you know that?

30:33.099 --> 30:35.167
TAYLOR:
Once we found out who you were,

30:35.201 --> 30:38.304
your parole officer was happy
to tell us who your wife is.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.406
Turns out that
Molly had heard

30:40.439 --> 30:42.408
one of Hinde's
radio commercials,

30:42.441 --> 30:44.310
and so, she went to him for one

30:44.343 --> 30:46.512
of those quickie divorces
right after you got locked up.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.247
DANVILLE:
But it turned out

30:48.280 --> 30:50.549
to be much more than
just a quickie, didn't it?

30:50.582 --> 30:53.485
Sleeping
with a freakin' attorney.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.587
I wanted to kill that bitch.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.356
That might explains why

30:57.389 --> 30:59.225
we found your wife hiding
in a hotel.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.360
She knew exactly
how violent you were.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.395
I tried to calm down.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.298
I even took myself out
for a drink.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.935
But I just sat in that bar
getting more and more pissed.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.504
Then opportunity
suddenly presented itself.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.407
Think of what this kind
of technology can mean

31:15.441 --> 31:17.443
to law enforcement
or the military.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.546
Low-cost weapons can be
printed whenever they're needed

31:20.579 --> 31:23.415
by precincts or platoons
around the world.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.617
Now, all I need is the funding

31:25.651 --> 31:28.354
to be able to continue
my research, and then...

31:28.387 --> 31:30.122
Kid...

31:30.156 --> 31:31.523
I'm all in.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.560
Just do me a favor.

31:34.593 --> 31:35.962
Yeah, what's that?

31:35.995 --> 31:38.064
Show me, don't tell me.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.306
(hose hisses)

31:52.244 --> 31:53.545
(chuckles)

31:53.579 --> 31:55.681
And it takes regular rounds?

31:58.284 --> 32:00.452
See for yourself.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.488
(barrel clicks)

32:07.526 --> 32:08.494
Whoa,

32:08.527 --> 32:11.063
be careful where you point that.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.564
You're telling me
to be careful?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.434
When you just gave a gold mine

32:15.467 --> 32:16.969
to the wrong guy.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.037
Wait, what are you
talking about?

32:18.637 --> 32:19.972
(grunts)

32:23.509 --> 32:26.145
You're a genius, kid.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.980
For an idiot.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.582
You killed an innocent young man

32:30.616 --> 32:32.184
and then stole
his idea.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.253
Then used it to kill
someone else.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.491
No... No!

32:40.459 --> 32:41.627
(shouts)

32:41.660 --> 32:42.628
DANVILLE:
But your plan kind of...

32:42.661 --> 32:44.330
backfired on you, didn't it?

32:44.363 --> 32:45.631
(groans)

32:45.664 --> 32:47.633
That stupid kid.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.668
Half-assed gun.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.506
That... cheating son of a bitch

32:54.540 --> 32:57.443
messing around with my wife.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.778
If you ask me...

32:59.811 --> 33:02.014
they both had it coming.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.485
No, Mr. Lewis.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.520
But you certainly do.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.161
What do we do
with Justin's printer?

33:15.194 --> 33:18.297
We'll have it sent over to the
Brooklyn University of Science

33:18.330 --> 33:19.631
after Lewis
is convicted.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.200
And his software?

33:21.233 --> 33:23.202
Good or bad,

33:23.235 --> 33:25.437
you can't stop ideas.
Sooner or later,

33:25.471 --> 33:29.041
I'm sure that somebody else will
figure out how to print a gun.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.176
But until they do,

33:30.209 --> 33:33.812
I think we should just keep
that info to ourselves.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.216
Okay. Sounds like
an excellent plan.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.651
Let me ask you
a question-- if you had

33:39.685 --> 33:40.686
a million dollars
to spend,

33:40.719 --> 33:43.422
would you ever give your money
to a total stranger?

33:43.455 --> 33:44.590
Don't tell me
you're caught up

33:44.623 --> 33:46.492
in this whole
Guardian Angel story.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.494
Richard Kemp is
about as see-through

33:48.527 --> 33:50.629
as the hot air coming
out of his mouth.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.764
I know.
But what if it's not him?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.533
Well, he's certainly
claiming otherwise.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.434
What if he's lying?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.369
What if somebody else
gave the money away?

33:57.403 --> 34:00.739
Then I'd expect that person
to come forward, wouldn't you?

34:00.772 --> 34:02.808
Unless they'd rather
remain anonymous.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.710
Why are you so
suspicious anyway?

34:04.743 --> 34:07.246
You got a bead on the
real Guardian Angel?

34:07.279 --> 34:08.614
Maybe.

34:08.647 --> 34:09.748
Well, you gonna tell me?

34:09.781 --> 34:11.783
Nope.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.753
*

34:14.786 --> 34:16.788
(Ping-Pong balls clacking)

34:20.426 --> 34:24.130
* It's bigger than love

34:24.163 --> 34:27.733
* Brighter than all
the stars combined *

34:27.766 --> 34:30.302
* It's dwarfing the sun
(groans)

34:31.270 --> 34:32.304
I'm impressed.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.473
You got some pretty good skills.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.806
You got a nasty
little serve yourself.

34:35.841 --> 34:36.641
Ooh!

34:36.675 --> 34:39.445
What do you say
we take it up a notch?

34:39.478 --> 34:41.880
All right, what do
you got in mind?
Best two out of three.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.547
I'm in.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.583
Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.617
What does the winner get?

34:45.650 --> 34:48.420
Whatever the winner wants.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.888
Ooh, I can tell

34:49.920 --> 34:51.190
this is gonna get ugly.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.428
* Brighter than
all the stars combined *

34:56.462 --> 34:59.198
* It's dwarfing the sun

34:59.231 --> 35:01.633
Didn't I tell you
that was a good time?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.469
You did.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.638
And I didn't believe you.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.508
But it was a really nice time.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.600
Just collecting my winnings.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.569
So...

35:37.603 --> 35:38.904
we done playing Ping-Pong?

35:38.937 --> 35:42.140
Yeah, we're done
playing Ping-Pong.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.312
(car alarm chirps)

36:07.933 --> 36:10.168
(bell dings)

36:11.002 --> 36:12.871
Hey, Sid.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.707
Jo, what are you doing
down here so late?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.676
Just came by to chitchat
for a few minutes.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.345
I'm so fascinated

36:19.378 --> 36:21.313
by this whole Guardian Angel
story in the news.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.581
Really?

36:22.614 --> 36:23.882
I've been trying to avoid it.
Uh...

36:23.915 --> 36:25.351
Do you remember
Mauricio Flores?

36:25.384 --> 36:27.653
No.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.654
Should I?

36:28.687 --> 36:30.922
Well, I recognized his
name right off the bat

36:30.956 --> 36:32.891
from a case we
worked on together

36:32.924 --> 36:33.992
a couple years ago.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.528
His mother was killed
in the projects.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.929
And all those other people.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.766
Carolyn Sutton, lost her husband
in a home invasion.

36:40.799 --> 36:44.436
Kevin and Rachel Carpenter.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.472
She lost her dad
in a hit-and-run.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.674
And the traffic cop,
Rhonda Reynolds,

36:48.707 --> 36:50.509
buried her teenage son
after a drive-by.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.344
You know what's fascinating
about all these

36:52.378 --> 36:54.846
is that they're all connected
by crime.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.517
Now that you mention it,
I guess it is.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.391
And you know what
really gets me

37:05.424 --> 37:08.927
is that all the
employees at NYPD

37:08.960 --> 37:11.663
have their fingerprints
on file in AFIS,

37:11.697 --> 37:12.831
Sid.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.866
Yeah.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.504
Or should I call you
the Guardian Angel?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.511
(sighs, chuckles)

37:28.747 --> 37:31.750
I should've worn gloves,

37:31.783 --> 37:34.286
but I didn't exactly think
I was committing a crime.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.521
Well, you weren't.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.955
Still, I couldn't help
trying to figure out

37:36.988 --> 37:38.890
why you would be giving
$10 million

37:38.924 --> 37:42.828
of your hard earned patent money
to complete and total strangers.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.431
Until I realized
that all these people

37:45.464 --> 37:47.533
had lost someone they loved.

37:47.566 --> 37:50.402
Somebody whose autopsies
were on your table.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.874
What are you,
a detective or something?

37:57.409 --> 38:00.912
These ten cases,
they really stuck with me, Jo,

38:00.946 --> 38:03.715
I mean, because their losses

38:03.749 --> 38:06.785
only got worse.

38:06.818 --> 38:10.422
They-they got
pink-slipped

38:10.456 --> 38:11.857
or hit with back taxes

38:11.890 --> 38:14.460
or had to drop out of school.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.496
I just wanted to try

38:17.529 --> 38:20.932
and repair some of the damage,
you know?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.768
'Cause, I mean, let's face it.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.470
That's something people

38:24.503 --> 38:25.937
in our business
rarely get to do.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.607
So I decided to hand-deliver

38:28.640 --> 38:31.877
those checks because I wanted

38:31.910 --> 38:35.814
to personally hand
someone hope.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.517
Some kind of joy.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.919
Of course, we all deserve that,

38:40.952 --> 38:44.890
but trust me, Jo, these folks
deserved it so much more.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.359
RACHEL (in distance):
A million dollars?

38:47.393 --> 38:48.527
KEVIN:
Are you kidding me?

38:48.560 --> 38:49.961
RACHEL:
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

38:49.995 --> 38:50.629
KEVIN:
Are you kidding me?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.664
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!

38:52.698 --> 38:55.867
And you know what,
more than anything else,

38:55.901 --> 38:59.037
I wanted to reassure
those people

38:59.070 --> 39:01.540
that somebody out there
still understands

39:01.573 --> 39:04.810
there's always more

39:04.843 --> 39:07.713
than one victim in a crime.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.884
DANVILLE:
Sid, I can't imagine
how you've changed

39:12.918 --> 39:14.920
these people's lives.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.121
Well...

39:16.154 --> 39:17.823
But do you really want
to give away

39:17.856 --> 39:18.924
all your money?

39:18.957 --> 39:20.892
Well,

39:20.926 --> 39:22.761
it's like they always say,

39:22.794 --> 39:24.763
you can't take it with you.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.799
(chuckles)
What, are you going somewhere?

39:27.833 --> 39:30.936
Uh...

39:35.541 --> 39:37.943
Jo, you were the first person

39:37.976 --> 39:40.078
I confided in
when I became a millionaire.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.113
So now, uh,

39:42.147 --> 39:46.685
can I ask you to be
my confidant again?

39:46.718 --> 39:47.886
Of course.

39:47.919 --> 39:48.887
What's up?

39:54.460 --> 39:55.927
(clears throat)

39:55.961 --> 39:59.097
I've been diagnosed with cancer.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.973
Yeah, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
to be exact.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.976
Uh... I'm still doing
a bunch of tests,

40:11.009 --> 40:14.012
trying to figure out
how far it may have spread.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.949
I've known for a while,

40:17.983 --> 40:20.652
but it's just
easier... never mind.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.491
Sid.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.526
What's the prognosis?

40:27.559 --> 40:29.695
Oh, uh,

40:29.728 --> 40:31.597
you know doctors.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.465
They've all got their opinion.

40:33.499 --> 40:37.903
But, uh, you know, we've all
got an expiration date, right?

40:37.936 --> 40:42.240
Whether it's tomorrow
or ten years from now.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.876
It's what we do

40:44.910 --> 40:47.646
before then that matters.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.750
That's why I gave the
money to those people, Jo.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.852
I mean,

40:53.885 --> 40:56.722
most of us aren't around
to see what happens

40:56.755 --> 41:00.025
to the inheritance
that we leave behind.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.661
I want to know

41:02.694 --> 41:05.096
what kind of difference
I've made.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.965
Sid,

41:06.998 --> 41:10.468
(crying):
you have no idea.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.808
You...

41:16.842 --> 41:18.043
All right.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.648
Are you in any pain?

41:24.650 --> 41:26.785
Not really.

41:26.818 --> 41:30.556
But if there comes a time

41:30.589 --> 41:34.225
when I can't do my job,

41:34.259 --> 41:37.863
I won't hesitate to step aside.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.066
Just please,

41:41.099 --> 41:44.235
please let it be
on my own terms.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.605
I promise.

41:48.674 --> 41:51.810
Promise me
you're not telling me good-bye.

41:51.843 --> 41:52.978
No.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.980
Are you kidding me?

41:55.013 --> 41:57.849
I've got way too
much work to do.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.551
(chuckles)

41:59.585 --> 42:01.152
No, this is only...

42:01.186 --> 42:03.622
good night.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.923
Okay.
