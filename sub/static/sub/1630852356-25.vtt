[Cricket] Ugh, we're wasting
a really nice day in here!

00:04.627 --> 00:06.416
Why do we gotta
get new tools anyway?

00:06.417 --> 00:08.506
The ones we got at home
are perfectly good.

00:08.507 --> 00:10.876
Perfectly good?
They're not even tools!

00:10.877 --> 00:12.876
Our lawn mower is a goat.

00:12.877 --> 00:14.836
- I think she's full.

work as intended.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.626
[shouting]

00:19.627 --> 00:22.626
And the scare-gnome actually
works a little too well.

00:22.627 --> 00:25.206
[tense music plays]

00:25.207 --> 00:27.836
We need new tools so we
can finish all our chores.

00:27.837 --> 00:30.916
Man, I hate chores.
I wish I could get rid
of chores forever.

00:30.917 --> 00:33.006
[woman] Do you want to get
rid of chores forever?

00:33.007 --> 00:34.916
- What was that?
- Hi there, customer!

00:34.917 --> 00:36.706
A hologram!
I'll handle this!

00:36.707 --> 00:38.836
It's just me, Gwendolyn Zapp,

00:38.837 --> 00:42.256
announcing Big Tech's first
foray into modern farming!

00:42.257 --> 00:44.506
Stay back, Dad.
She's invincible.

00:44.507 --> 00:46.666
Oh, she's that wacky gizmo lady!

00:46.667 --> 00:48.706
She tried to take
my truck to Mars.

00:48.707 --> 00:50.336
Let me introduce you
to Big Tech's

newest creation... FRANK!

00:52.757 --> 00:55.876
Farm Robot Assistant Networ-- k!

00:55.877 --> 00:59.416
Ever since I got my FRANK,
I haven't done diddly squat!

00:59.417 --> 01:03.256
[Gwendolyn] Every FRANK robot
features "Farmers True Grit"
programming,

01:03.257 --> 01:06.416
modeled from the DNA
of actual human farmers.

01:06.417 --> 01:08.336
- Wait, what?
- Wow!

01:08.337 --> 01:11.836
But enough from me!
I'll let FRANK say hello!

01:11.837 --> 01:14.126
- Morning, friend.
- Dang!

01:14.127 --> 01:17.966
If I had known robots could
take our jobs, I would have
been on board a long time ago.

01:17.967 --> 01:20.796
Well, son, I'm just not
sure we can afford a FRANK.

01:20.797 --> 01:23.336
Did I mention we have
a 30 day free trial?

01:23.337 --> 01:25.006
How did she know
what we were talking about?

01:25.007 --> 01:26.706
My tech is definitely not

01:26.707 --> 01:28.166
listening in
on your conversations.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.796
- Wink. Bye!
- Did you hear that?

01:30.797 --> 01:32.796
A 30-day free trial!

01:32.797 --> 01:36.336
Oh, my... [screams]
Dad, can we get one?!

01:36.337 --> 01:39.006
Huh, it would allow everyone
a little more free time.

01:39.007 --> 01:40.506
I wouldn't know what
to do with myself.

01:40.507 --> 01:41.756
I know! It'd be great!

01:41.757 --> 01:44.086
Well... why not?

01:44.087 --> 01:45.586
Yes!

01:45.587 --> 01:48.336
[laughing]

01:48.337 --> 01:49.966
So how do we turn it on?

01:49.967 --> 01:51.966
Probably by hitting this.

01:51.967 --> 01:55.966
[whirring]

01:55.967 --> 01:57.836

- Whoa!

01:57.837 --> 01:59.876
Technology's amazing.

01:59.877 --> 02:01.916

02:08.967 --> 02:11.586
Success. Tasks complete.

02:11.587 --> 02:13.796
Hm. I guess FRANK
really is perfect.

02:13.797 --> 02:16.966
Ha! Chores are done!
Free time, here I come!

02:16.967 --> 02:19.917
And I guess I'll go... hm.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.836
I got a million ideas on
how to spend my time today.

02:23.837 --> 02:26.466
But first, leaf blower jetpack!

02:26.467 --> 02:29.666
Starting countdown!
Three, two, one...

02:29.667 --> 02:31.046

- Ah!

02:31.047 --> 02:33.507
Leaf blower jetpack.
Looks fun!

02:34.837 --> 02:35.876
[chuckles]

02:35.877 --> 02:37.836
What are you doing, Dad?

02:37.837 --> 02:40.166
Well, FRANK's really
been taking care of things.

02:40.167 --> 02:43.626
And I usually spend all day
working on the farm, so...

02:43.627 --> 02:47.086
- So...?
- So... got room for two
in that thing?

02:47.087 --> 02:50.466
- Uh, it's really meant
for one person.
- No problem!

02:50.467 --> 02:52.086
I'll strap in and carry you!

02:52.087 --> 02:54.466
Ah, this brings back
some good memories.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.876
I remember when you were
a cute widdle baby, and I'd
fly you around like this!

02:58.877 --> 03:01.296
- Where did the time go?
- You know what?

03:01.297 --> 03:03.916
I bet Gramma could use some
company! Let's go see Gramma!

03:03.917 --> 03:06.336
[man on TV] Yeah,
so we've got our nice
little demon soldier here,

03:06.337 --> 03:08.046
little harbinger of doom here.

03:08.047 --> 03:09.836
And we're gonna use
a little cadmium red

03:09.837 --> 03:11.706
just give his face
a little splash of gore here.

03:11.707 --> 03:13.666
Yep, that is a happy
bit of gore right there.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.966
Ah, Alice, you earned this.

03:15.967 --> 03:19.466
Hey, Gramma. Do you mind
if Dad hung out here
for a little bit?

03:19.467 --> 03:21.916
He needs something to do.

03:21.917 --> 03:25.006
- It's a free country.
- Whoo-hoo! Okay,
see ya later Dad!

03:25.007 --> 03:28.006
- [laughs] Okay, see ya!
- [man on TV] Now,
let's get real loose

03:28.007 --> 03:31.966
- with those brush strokes.
- Wow. I had no idea
you were a painter, Ma.

03:31.967 --> 03:36.336
- Gee, my Ma, an "arteest."
- Mm-hm.

03:36.337 --> 03:40.916
I guess before I was so busy
farming all day that I had
no idea what you were up to.

03:40.917 --> 03:43.916
Just relax,
and feel your painting.

03:43.917 --> 03:47.876
Yeah, well,
I guess we all gotta find
a way to pass our... time.

03:47.877 --> 03:52.296
Bill, what are you doing?

03:52.297 --> 03:55.046
Just trying to relax
and feel the painting.

03:55.047 --> 03:57.756
And I feel like this could
use a little yellow sun.

03:57.757 --> 04:01.756
Sweetie pie,
while I appreciate your help,

04:01.757 --> 04:04.416
maybe you should go see
what Tilly's doing.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.666
Before something happens to you.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.876
[Tilly] More tea, Sir Saxon?

what to do with himself!

04:54.797 --> 04:56.876
He's lost his sense of purpose!

04:56.877 --> 04:59.296
All because you brought home
that battery-powered demon!

know how to use his free time.

to be a chore-free day.

Phoenix. Go on, girl,
go get the ball.

05:29.627 --> 05:32.666
Dad, you need to find something
to do with your free time

from living their lives.

for maximum relaxation.

09:41.837 --> 09:45.586
Ma, Tilly, Cricket!
Cricket was right.

09:45.587 --> 09:48.706
My purpose in life is
built around two things.

09:48.707 --> 09:51.916
One... [grunts]
working on my farm.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.756
- [gasps]
- [Bill] And two...

09:53.757 --> 09:54.836
He's doing it.

09:54.837 --> 09:56.916
...protecting my family!

09:56.917 --> 10:00.006
Dad's back!
You're in for it now, tin man!

10:00.007 --> 10:02.966
Hey, robot! Get out
of the Green Family Farm!

10:02.967 --> 10:05.836
Just try and stop me,
flesh being.

10:05.837 --> 10:08.047
I think I... will!

10:09.207 --> 10:11.256
Ha, ha! Missed me!

10:11.257 --> 10:12.876
Ooh! Ow!

10:12.877 --> 10:14.586
Oh, no! Oh, no!

10:14.587 --> 10:16.587
Oh, yeah!

10:18.547 --> 10:21.206
Hi, welcome to Overhauls.
How can I help you?

10:21.207 --> 10:25.756
We'd like to return this robot
on account of it beat me up
and tried to take over our farm.

10:25.757 --> 10:27.336
And usurped my life's purpose.

10:27.337 --> 10:29.206
[laughs] Yeah,
that's been happening a lot.

10:29.207 --> 10:30.887
So would you like
a refund or store credit?
