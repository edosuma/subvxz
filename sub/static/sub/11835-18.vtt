WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.803
DOLE:
Previously on The Practice...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.170
BERLUTI: You were smoking crack

00:04.204 --> 00:05.672
with an eight-month baby.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.373
Please just get me out!

00:07.407 --> 00:08.909
BERLUTI: If I get you out,

00:08.942 --> 00:11.144
you go into rehab immediately.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.412
I promise.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.214
DOCTOR: The placental lining
started to come loose

00:14.247 --> 00:15.248
from the uterine wall,

00:15.281 --> 00:16.983
and there was cocaine
in her body.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.484
The baby?
DOCTOR: Little girl,

00:18.519 --> 00:19.686
three and a half pounds.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.022
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

00:22.055 --> 00:22.856
Okay.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.626
DONNELL: This is unbelievable!

00:25.659 --> 00:27.360
Two lovers
and they're both dead?

00:27.393 --> 00:28.795
What, you think just
because you got away

00:28.829 --> 00:30.063
with it last time,
you can get away

00:30.096 --> 00:31.932
with it whenever?
Yes.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.701
DOCTOR: He has a narcissistic
personality disorder.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.670
He commits a crime

00:36.703 --> 00:39.272
where it's impossible
not to convict him,

00:39.305 --> 00:41.074
and the game is still

00:41.107 --> 00:42.075
getting away with it.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.710
Well, win or lose.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.478
Won't this be fun?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.914
Were you trying to wrestle
the knife away,

00:47.948 --> 00:49.583
or were you trying
to kill him?

00:49.616 --> 00:51.417
It went into him
during the struggle.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.553
It went in by accident?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.387
How many ways can I say it?

00:54.420 --> 00:56.122
MAN: We find the defendant,
Joseph Heric,

00:56.156 --> 00:57.323
not guilty.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.293
(music playing)

01:05.632 --> 01:08.569
(horns honking)

01:12.205 --> 01:15.609
God, she's really
getting a personality.

01:15.642 --> 01:16.877
DONNELL: All right,
I'm out of here.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.452
Who'd you kill?

01:26.486 --> 01:28.722
Good to see you, too, Ellenor.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.090
Have you put on weight?

01:30.123 --> 01:31.958
We're busy, Joey.
Who'd you kill?

01:31.992 --> 01:33.159
Very cute.
Well, can't anybody say,

01:33.193 --> 01:36.262
"Hey, good to see you?"

01:36.296 --> 01:36.997
(baby chuckles)

01:37.030 --> 01:38.431
Whose is that?

01:38.464 --> 01:39.933
Mine. What are you doing here?

01:39.966 --> 01:41.802
You have a baby?

01:41.835 --> 01:43.604
DONNELL:
Joey, why are you here?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.471
Why don't we start by asking

01:45.506 --> 01:47.541
where I've been
for the last three years?

01:50.143 --> 01:51.712
Law school.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.746
Ta-da!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.548
Passed the bar in February.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.149
We're now all learned brothers.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.584
You're a lawyer?

01:57.618 --> 01:58.985
And a good one, so far.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.987
YOUNG: Wait, wait, wait.
You went to law school,

02:01.021 --> 02:01.988
took the bar exam?

02:02.022 --> 02:04.124
HERIC:
It was my therapist's idea.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.792
He thought one way
of weaning myself off

02:05.826 --> 02:07.728
of killing people
was to help others

02:07.761 --> 02:09.596
who did get away with it.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.496
I've got a case now

02:10.531 --> 02:11.364
that's why I'm here.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.099
Case? What kind of case?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.001
Homicide.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.103
I don't slum.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.372
The problem I'm having is this,

02:19.405 --> 02:21.675
I think the kid might
actually be innocent.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.409
And as good as I am,

02:23.443 --> 02:25.245
my conscience says
I should bring someone else

02:25.278 --> 02:26.980
on board with experience.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.381
FRUTT: So, in addition
to getting a law degree,

02:28.414 --> 02:29.816
you also picked up
a conscience?

02:29.850 --> 02:33.153
Drives like new,
hardly any miles on it.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.756
But seriously, Bobby,

02:35.789 --> 02:37.257
I'd never admit this publicly,

02:37.290 --> 02:39.526
but I could really
use some help.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.427
It starts tomorrow.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.428
Tomorrow?
HERIC: Yeah.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.597
I'm ready.
I can do this.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.798
And I could do it alone.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.332
I'm prepared to if I have to,

02:46.366 --> 02:49.169
but to be honest,

02:49.202 --> 02:51.437
with an innocent kid's life
on the line,

02:51.471 --> 02:54.140
believe it or not,
I don't want to.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.341
Come on, what do you say?

02:55.375 --> 02:58.311
You, me, Ellie,

02:58.344 --> 03:00.246
it'll be fun.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.115
Just like old times.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.526
(music playing)

03:58.038 --> 04:00.674
WASHINGTON:
You're actually helping him?

04:00.707 --> 04:02.208
And you?
FRUTT: Come on.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.277
I can't resist.
But he's a murderer.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.111
We only know that

04:05.145 --> 04:06.747
because we represented him.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.182
DOLE: Even so, we also know
he's clinically sick.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.383
Look, the ship has sailed.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.652
I'd said I'd help.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.787
Jimmy, it's someone
from Brigham Hospital.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.558
Jimmy Berluti.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.695
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Myser to x-ray.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.630
Dr. Myser to x-ray.

04:23.664 --> 04:27.100
(music playing)

04:27.133 --> 04:28.134
Hi.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.403
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.872
Hey. Shh.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.942
This is Lucy Hatcher.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.578
She works with me.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.445
She also works
for Rape Crisis.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.049
I feel so stupid.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.451
What happened?

04:45.485 --> 04:50.356
You're gonna be mad, Jimmy.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.124
I'm still a...

04:51.157 --> 04:52.693
Prostitution?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.631
JENNIFER: It was a trick.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.732
He just went crazy.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.235
I don't--I'm so sorry.

05:02.268 --> 05:03.537
Where's your baby?

05:03.570 --> 05:05.506
She's with a friend.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.507
She's okay.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.976
So, what happened?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.745
One of your tricks
beat you up?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.681
He raped me.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.817
And then he beat me up.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.184
He raped you?

05:19.586 --> 05:22.155
The sex wasn't consensual?

05:22.188 --> 05:23.924
No.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.458
I mean, it probably
would have been.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.160
I mean,
we went to a room, too.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.696
But as soon as we got there,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.798
he just wigged out.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.334
It was like he had this thing
against hookers,

05:34.367 --> 05:35.736
like we were evil.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.204
I told him to get out,

05:38.238 --> 05:40.541
and he raped me.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.375
Do you think
you might recognize him

05:42.408 --> 05:45.145
if the police showed
you some photographs?

05:46.713 --> 05:48.314
He gave me his name.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.755
I told it to the police.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.927
ROLAND: The body
of Jean Homestead was found

06:00.961 --> 06:02.596
in an alley off
of Tremont Street,

06:02.629 --> 06:04.430
a deep gash in the back
of her head,

06:04.464 --> 06:08.134
the apparent victim
of a mugging.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.335
That's the way it looked

06:09.369 --> 06:11.171
because that's the way
that Daniel Carrington

06:11.204 --> 06:12.138
wanted it to look.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.074
But that is not the way
she died,

06:14.107 --> 06:15.108
ladies and gentlemen.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.312
The evidence
will show overwhelmingly,

06:19.345 --> 06:21.982
the defendant drove
to the victim's house,

06:22.015 --> 06:24.685
murdered Mrs. Homestead
in her bedroom,

06:24.718 --> 06:26.753
then drove her body back
into Boston

06:26.787 --> 06:29.690
and dumped her
into that alley.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.825
The evidence will establish
the defendant

06:31.858 --> 06:34.260
and the victim were
having an affair.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.897
And when the victim tried
to end the relationship,

06:36.930 --> 06:38.932
the defendant murdered her.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.720
The homicide rate
in this country,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.087
this city,
our city,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.857
the proud City of Boston,

07:03.890 --> 07:06.192
is starting to climb.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.562
And people,
people like me,

07:08.595 --> 07:10.931
you, are getting damn
sick of it.

07:12.298 --> 07:16.169
For one, I'm fed up
with exalting civil rights

07:16.202 --> 07:18.338
to the point
where the criminal

07:18.371 --> 07:21.508
enjoys more constitutional
privileges than we do.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.977
Enough already!

07:24.010 --> 07:27.013
If a person kills
another human being,

07:27.047 --> 07:28.915
I don't give a rat's ass

07:28.949 --> 07:31.017
whether he suffers
from schizophrenia,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.252
substance abuse,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.087
or an overbearing mother.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
I say put the son
of a bitch in jail.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.858
That's how I feel.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.594
It may be how some
of you feel, too.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.229
It's certainly how
the government feels,

07:43.263 --> 07:45.431
and I salute them for it.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.002
But,

07:49.035 --> 07:51.337
every once in a while,

07:51.371 --> 07:54.407
in their zeal,
their haste

07:54.440 --> 07:57.578
to make sure a murder
is avenged,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.012
they get it wrong,

07:59.045 --> 08:02.348
and they arrest
the wrong person.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.918
My heart goes out
to Jean Homestead's husband

08:04.951 --> 08:05.852
sitting there,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.453
and her son.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.156
We all wanna catch the person

08:10.190 --> 08:13.359
who killed Jean Homestead.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.961
But Daniel Carrington

08:14.995 --> 08:17.130
is not that person.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.701
They've arrested
the wrong man.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.049
Jimmy, the police
questioned the guy.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.317
What's his story?
Yeah.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.719
They went back
to her place,

08:38.751 --> 08:40.220
he didn't know
she was a hooker.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.056
After they had sex,
she announced she was,

08:43.089 --> 08:45.592
tried to extort him
for $10,000,

08:45.626 --> 08:46.860
he refused and left.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.663
And you believe that?
Jimmy, the examination

08:49.696 --> 08:51.832
didn't reveal
any vaginal bruising

08:51.865 --> 08:54.835
or tearing.
You see her face?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.402
You think she did
that to herself?

08:56.436 --> 08:59.239
I can't rule out
the possibility that she did.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.974
Why?
This is a hooker

09:01.007 --> 09:02.709
with a drug problem.

09:02.743 --> 09:06.046
Listen, even if
she's telling you the truth,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.782
a prostitute takes a man
to a room to have sex,

09:08.815 --> 09:11.885
then claims the sex
wasn't consensual.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.988
I'm not that good a DA.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.661
Both blows came to the back
of the skull.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.228
The second one,

09:22.262 --> 09:24.430
this one,
was fatal.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.032
It crushed both the skull

09:26.066 --> 09:27.834
and the brainstem.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.070
Death likely came instantly.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.672
ROLAND: And did you make
any other findings

09:31.705 --> 09:33.073
that you find significant?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.140
JOSH: Several.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.909
There were no other bruises,

09:35.942 --> 09:38.311
scratches,
no skin scrapings

09:38.344 --> 09:39.245
under her nails,

09:39.279 --> 09:40.914
no indication of a struggle.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.949
And what did that tell you?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.184
JOSH: Well, that
it's highly unlikely

09:44.217 --> 09:46.720
she was mugged,
or overpowered.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.422
Much more likely,
she was simply struck

09:49.455 --> 09:50.156
on the back of the head.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.925
ROLAND: Anything else?

09:51.958 --> 09:53.393
JOSH: We found small traces

09:53.426 --> 09:55.829
of semen in the vaginal area.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.965
We submitted samples
for DNA analysis.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.134
They were an exact
genetic match

10:01.167 --> 10:02.068
with the defendant.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.737
ROLAND: Thank you, Doctor.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.177
First of all, Doctor,

10:11.211 --> 10:13.179
let me applaud you
on your ability

10:13.213 --> 10:15.549
to crunch your testimony.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.217
So many experts,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.952
especially doctors,

10:18.985 --> 10:20.921
just rattle on
in such technical talk,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.924
it's either boring
or incomprehensible.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.559
I salute you, sir.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.760
Thank you.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.629
I probably shouldn't
be admitting this,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.764
but I can't take issue

10:30.797 --> 10:33.066
with a single thing you said.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.068
I agree with all of it.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.437
So, I'm going to sit down

10:37.470 --> 10:38.438
so we can move on.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.210
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.078
There is one thing.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.181
It is possible for her
to be mugged

10:48.214 --> 10:50.116
and dragged
into the alleyway

10:50.150 --> 10:52.385
without showing
any physical signs,

10:52.418 --> 10:54.521
such as bruising
or fingernail scrapings?

10:54.555 --> 10:56.990
Yes, it's possible.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.158
Excellent. Thanks.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.427
Oh, oh, one other thing.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.765
If my client had had intercourse

11:04.798 --> 11:06.767
with the victim several hours

11:06.800 --> 11:09.235
before her death,

11:09.269 --> 11:11.471
semen evidence
could still be found,

11:11.505 --> 11:12.138
couldn't it?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.674
Yes.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.310
HERIC: So it's possible
my client

11:17.343 --> 11:20.113
and the victim had sex,

11:20.146 --> 11:22.749
she was later hit on the head

11:22.783 --> 11:25.318
and killed by somebody else?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.153
Your findings don't exclude
that possibility,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.655
do they, Doctor?

11:28.689 --> 11:29.322
No.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.091
Thank you.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.534
How'd I do?

11:44.771 --> 11:46.006
He raped me.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.974
And it would be your word
against his.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.844
Do you know who he is?

11:50.877 --> 11:51.712
Russell Mathis.

11:51.745 --> 11:55.248
He's a very prominent Lawyer.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.451
He would be perceived
to be more credible

11:58.484 --> 12:01.555
than a hooker
with a drug history.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.891
Look, I'm your friend.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.427
There's nothing
to be done here.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.763
YOUNG: Maybe not criminally.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.599
I would think
Mr. Mathis would like us

12:12.633 --> 12:14.367
to go away without any noise.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.971
(music playing)

12:18.004 --> 12:20.607
I'll go pay him a visit, Jimmy.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.615
JEAN (over recording):
I'm ending it now, Danny.

12:28.649 --> 12:30.083
I can't see you anymore.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.118
I'm married,
and the truth is,

12:32.152 --> 12:34.220
you're beginning
to frighten me a little.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.558
I just need you to stay away.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.094
That was identified
as the voice of the victim?

12:41.127 --> 12:43.196
Identified
by her husband, yes.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.265
ROLAND: Where was this message
found, Detective?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.367
On the defendant's voicemail,

12:47.400 --> 12:48.535
recorded six minutes

12:48.569 --> 12:50.571
past 9:00 on January 17th.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.973
ROLAND: And according
to the coroner's findings,

12:53.006 --> 12:54.875
when did Mrs. Homestead die?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.442
Her body temperature indicated

12:56.476 --> 12:58.779
that she died about 10:00 PM
that same night.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.146
Did you make any findings

13:00.180 --> 13:02.048
as to where she died,
Detective?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.117
Our conclusion
was that she died

13:04.150 --> 13:05.351
in her own bedroom.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.987
There were microscopic
blood splatterings

13:07.020 --> 13:08.889
on her bedpost
as well as the carpet.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.925
The blood matched up
genetically to the victim.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.960
We believe
she was killed there

13:13.994 --> 13:14.961
and then moved.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.930
Any other evidence
lead you to this?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.499
We also found microscopic
blood splatterings

13:19.533 --> 13:20.801
in the defendant's car,

13:20.834 --> 13:23.537
blood that also belonged
to the victim.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.938
Thank you, Detective.

13:31.512 --> 13:33.714
Well, things really look bleak

13:33.747 --> 13:35.048
for our side,
don't they?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.252
Now, I imagine

13:39.285 --> 13:41.487
that's why
you arrested my client.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.123
The phone message,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.025
the blood splatterings,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.192
the affair--

13:48.061 --> 13:49.796
well, come to think of it,

13:49.830 --> 13:50.797
that would be it,
wouldn't it?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.099
I mean, that's your entire case,

13:53.133 --> 13:55.836
blood, phone message,
and affair.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.870
Right, Detective?

13:56.903 --> 13:58.004
And his semen.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.640
Right. Well,
I was sort of including

13:59.673 --> 14:00.541
that with "affair."

14:02.108 --> 14:03.276
Any weapon?

14:03.309 --> 14:04.511
No.

14:04.545 --> 14:06.112
Any evidence,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.748
physical, forensic,

14:07.781 --> 14:09.516
testimonial that my client

14:09.550 --> 14:11.217
was in the victim's bedroom
that night?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.586
His semen.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.787
Well, the coroner
has already admitted

14:13.820 --> 14:15.856
that they could
have made love earlier,

14:15.889 --> 14:17.457
maybe even someplace else.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.026
Do you disagree with
the coroner on that, Detective?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.862
No.
HERIC: And this blood

14:21.895 --> 14:23.096
you're talking about,

14:23.129 --> 14:25.699
"microscopic," you said.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.667
So, if we took all this blood

14:26.700 --> 14:27.668
and pooled it together,

14:27.701 --> 14:29.503
the blood you found
both in her bedroom

14:29.536 --> 14:31.505
and my client's car,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.974
more or less than

14:34.007 --> 14:36.176
a paper cut, Detective?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.944
Probably less.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.881
Gee, it doesn't look as bad

14:40.914 --> 14:41.915
for us as I thought.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.183
Objection!

14:44.284 --> 14:46.352
Is it wise to be smug, Joey?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.420
HERIC: Oh, Danny,

14:47.453 --> 14:48.421
that was nothing.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.856
Ask Ellenor.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.358
Have they offered
any kind of plea here?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.360
Second degree,
it's laughable.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
DONNELL:
What are you willing to take?

14:55.596 --> 14:57.931
We thought an acquittal

14:57.964 --> 14:58.599
would be nice.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.634
Yes, besides that.

15:01.802 --> 15:04.605
Danny, would you
consider manslaughter?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.174
Joey thinks we can win.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.843
DONNELL: This is Joey's
first murder trial.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.578
Bobby!
He needs to hear that, Joey.

15:12.713 --> 15:15.181
What? You don't think
we can win?

15:21.788 --> 15:24.858
Yes, you have a shot here.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.159
But your lawyer's opinions

15:26.192 --> 15:27.561
are colored by his ego.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.995
Bobby!
This is what you get

15:29.029 --> 15:30.363
for making me second chair.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.134
If you don't already know this,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.637
you need to as we go forward.

15:36.670 --> 15:39.606
(music playing)

15:42.543 --> 15:44.044
I've trusted Joey this far.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.679
I'm going to keep
trusting him.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.256
How is he?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.123
FRUTT: He's good.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.024
The jury loves him.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.459
It kills me to admit it.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.661
HERIC: Admit what?

16:02.328 --> 16:03.096
Hi, Helen.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.033
Do you know I've been having

16:07.067 --> 16:10.571
these nasty little
hetero dreams of you?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.608
What?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.110
DONNELL: Joey, the blood
in the car

16:17.143 --> 16:18.011
is a problem.

16:18.044 --> 16:18.945
I hope you don't plan

16:18.979 --> 16:20.313
to argue "paper cut."

16:20.346 --> 16:22.649
HERIC: Oh, no.
The beloved husband is up next.

16:22.683 --> 16:24.450
He's what you call
"Plan B."

16:24.484 --> 16:27.253
Wait a second.
He has no alibi!

16:27.287 --> 16:28.354
FRUTT: It doesn't matter.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.856
Do you have any evidence
that he killed her?

16:29.890 --> 16:32.092
No.
Well, then, you don't "Plan B,"

16:32.125 --> 16:33.694
not the widower.
Ellenor.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.796
FRUTT: If you accuse
the husband with nothing

16:35.829 --> 16:36.997
to back up the accusation,

16:37.030 --> 16:38.398
your client will get convicted.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.333
I agree.
HERIC: Bobby, Ellenor,

16:40.366 --> 16:42.368
I recognize that I don't
have your experience,

16:42.402 --> 16:44.404
but one thing
I do know, "Plan B,"

16:44.437 --> 16:47.874
that's where the practice
of law is delicious.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.716
PAULINE: Mr. Berluti,

16:55.749 --> 16:57.317
Mr. Mathis can see you now.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.260
You can close the door, Pauline.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.295
Yes, sir.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.509
It's the conclusion

17:22.542 --> 17:24.310
of a Rape Crisis Counselor

17:24.344 --> 17:26.179
that she was raped.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.815
She tells me she was raped,

17:28.849 --> 17:29.750
and I believe her.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.384
You believe her?

17:33.119 --> 17:36.757
Your client set me up,
Mr. Berluti.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.925
She had relations,
only then to tell me

17:38.959 --> 17:40.360
what her occupation was.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.796
And then she attempted
to extort me.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.865
Did she give herself
the black eye?

17:44.898 --> 17:45.532
RUSSELL: Perhaps she did.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.833
I assure you I didn't.

17:48.969 --> 17:51.572
Why are you here?

17:51.605 --> 17:52.806
The District Attorney's Office

17:52.839 --> 17:54.007
has to prove its case

17:54.040 --> 17:56.543
beyond all reasonable doubt.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.712
In civil cases,
as you know,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.782
the burden is much less.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.551
She makes
for a credible witness.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.452
Get to the punch line.

18:08.889 --> 18:10.791
We settle now

18:10.824 --> 18:12.192
or sue you tomorrow.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.161
(music playing)

18:19.099 --> 18:21.201
None of those people
would ever know.

18:29.142 --> 18:32.478
On your way out,
Mr. Berluti,

18:32.513 --> 18:35.816
take a glance
at the artwork on the walls.

18:35.849 --> 18:38.619
We are a very rich law firm,
Mr. Berluti.

18:38.652 --> 18:39.586
It's a byproduct

18:39.620 --> 18:43.056
of having many
excellent lawyers.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.592
Go forward
with this extortion,

18:45.626 --> 18:47.293
I'll deploy the attorneys here

18:47.327 --> 18:49.663
to destroy both your client

18:49.696 --> 18:51.364
and you.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.433
And that's not extortion?

18:58.004 --> 19:00.273
No, it isn't,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.308
because I didn't rape
your client.

19:04.545 --> 19:07.614
You may leave now, Mr. Berluti.

19:07.648 --> 19:10.617
(music playing)

19:21.595 --> 19:23.897
I thought maybe Jean
was out with friends,

19:23.930 --> 19:25.131
though it wasn't like her

19:25.165 --> 19:26.900
not to leave me a message.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.168
And finally,
around midnight,

19:28.201 --> 19:30.370
I began calling some
of her friends,

19:30.403 --> 19:33.306
and then at 3:00 AM,

19:33.339 --> 19:35.275
I phoned the police.

19:35.308 --> 19:39.513
Mr. Homestead, I know that
this is very difficult, sir,

19:39.546 --> 19:43.049
but did you have knowledge

19:43.083 --> 19:44.450
of your wife's affair

19:44.484 --> 19:45.719
with the defendant?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.053
I had learned about it

19:47.087 --> 19:48.088
a week before.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.456
ROLAND:
And how did you find out, sir?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.658
Jeannie had been in therapy,

19:51.692 --> 19:53.594
and her therapist
implored with her

19:53.627 --> 19:54.928
that she tell me.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.098
And as a result
of your finding out, you...

19:58.131 --> 20:00.466
We had some
very severe arguments,

20:00.500 --> 20:02.468
ending with a recommitment

20:02.503 --> 20:04.705
by both of us
to our marriage.

20:04.738 --> 20:06.106
ROLAND:
And as for the defendant?

20:06.139 --> 20:08.008
She planned to break
it off with him.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.876
Do you know
if she did that, sir?

20:09.910 --> 20:12.245
She said she had
three conversations

20:12.278 --> 20:14.314
telling him that he--
Objection, hearsay.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.081
Withdrawn.

20:15.115 --> 20:17.450
Joey.
Let it in, Ellenor.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.385
No, this is--
HERIC: The objection

20:19.419 --> 20:20.921
is withdrawn, Your Honor.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.789
I think we should
all hear this.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.025
Would you continue, sir?

20:25.058 --> 20:27.861
MICHAEL: She said that
he was having a difficult time

20:27.894 --> 20:29.530
accepting that they would
not be seeing

20:29.563 --> 20:31.197
one another again.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.366
Jean even thought
that she might eventually

20:33.399 --> 20:34.701
have to get
a restraining order.

20:34.735 --> 20:35.836
Why?

20:35.869 --> 20:38.038
She was becoming afraid of him.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.007
ROLAND: Did she use
that word, sir,

20:41.041 --> 20:42.976
"afraid?"
Yes.

20:44.044 --> 20:45.011
She was concerned

20:45.045 --> 20:46.980
that he might try
to hurt her.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.181
Thank you, sir.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.789
Well! Now I wish
we hadn't withdrawn

20:55.822 --> 20:56.890
our objection at all

20:56.923 --> 20:58.625
if I knew you were
going to say that.

20:58.659 --> 20:59.893
Mr. Heric.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.494
HERIC: So, your wife
told you the things

21:01.528 --> 21:03.730
she had been discussing
with her therapist?

21:03.764 --> 21:04.598
Yes.

21:04.631 --> 21:08.201
Had she engaged
in any other affairs?

21:08.234 --> 21:09.903
Not to my knowledge, no.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.237
Had she talked to you,

21:11.271 --> 21:13.273
perhaps, about being unusually

21:13.306 --> 21:16.409
attracted to a younger man,

21:16.442 --> 21:17.878
an attraction that both she

21:17.911 --> 21:20.647
and her therapist
considered unhealthy?

21:24.184 --> 21:25.519
Mr. Homestead,

21:25.552 --> 21:27.721
did she tell you
if she had been sexually

21:27.754 --> 21:29.823
attracted to another man,

21:29.856 --> 21:31.357
a younger man?

21:35.061 --> 21:35.862
Yes.

21:35.896 --> 21:38.565
A man that she had once
even kissed?

21:38.599 --> 21:40.133
Yes.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.668
HERIC: Sir, do you see that man

21:41.702 --> 21:42.869
in the courtroom today?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.209
Yes.

21:49.242 --> 21:51.845
Could you identify him
for the court, please?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.418
My son,

21:58.451 --> 21:59.419
her stepson.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.455
(music playing)

22:05.358 --> 22:06.760
Well, isn't this exciting?

22:06.793 --> 22:07.460
Objection!

22:07.493 --> 22:09.162
Withdrawn.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.097
For how many hours
were you home alone

22:11.131 --> 22:12.398
before notifying the police

22:12.432 --> 22:13.366
that your wife was missing?

22:13.399 --> 22:14.868
I don't know.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.670
Around five hours.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.972
Forgive me, sir,
but I have to ask the question

22:19.005 --> 22:21.374
that's on everybody's mind.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.543
Did you kill your wife?

22:22.576 --> 22:23.977
ROLAND: Objection!

22:24.010 --> 22:24.945
Overruled.

22:24.978 --> 22:25.946
Obviously,

22:25.979 --> 22:27.247
it wasn't over like she said

22:27.280 --> 22:28.314
between her and my client.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.683
They found his sperm.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.384
She clearly lied to you.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.686
She has an affair.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.688
You learned she kisses
her stepson,

22:34.721 --> 22:35.989
your son.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.323
Then you find out she's lying

22:37.357 --> 22:38.592
and still sleeping with the man

22:38.625 --> 22:39.926
she claims to be afraid of.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.927
If indeed she said that,

22:40.961 --> 22:42.462
only you know for sure.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.599
Did you kill your wife?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.267
No,

22:47.300 --> 22:48.168
I did not.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.373
I don't believe you.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.340
Objection!

22:54.374 --> 22:55.308
Mr. Heric?

22:55.341 --> 22:56.643
Nothing further, Your Honor.

22:59.580 --> 23:00.581
FRUTT: He doesn't

23:00.614 --> 23:02.716
need us, Bobby.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.117
He's not even letting us in

23:04.150 --> 23:05.118
on all of his cards.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.820
We're simply sitting
in a courtroom

23:06.853 --> 23:09.322
as spectators
to be impressed,

23:09.355 --> 23:10.156
which is exactly

23:10.190 --> 23:11.592
what his narcissistic disorder

23:11.625 --> 23:12.893
is all about.

23:12.926 --> 23:14.160
He needs other people

23:14.194 --> 23:15.495
to see his achievements

23:15.529 --> 23:17.097
in order for him to enjoy them.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.899
Well, we can't get out now,
Ellenor.

23:18.932 --> 23:21.868
(knocking on door)

23:23.770 --> 23:25.305
FRUTT: We were just talking
about you, Joey.

23:25.338 --> 23:27.440
Nice little bombshell.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.208
Wasn't it, though?

23:28.241 --> 23:29.810
Why didn't you tell us
about it?

23:29.843 --> 23:32.045
Oh, come on.
It'd ruin the surprise.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.814
Now the question becomes,

23:33.847 --> 23:35.549
"Do I let Daniel testify?"

23:35.582 --> 23:36.783
Things are going so well.

23:36.817 --> 23:38.985
Does he have any skeletons?

23:39.019 --> 23:39.820
Not that I'm aware of.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.287
Then he has to testify.

23:41.321 --> 23:42.723
He has to explain the semen.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.725
And the blood in his car.

23:44.758 --> 23:45.892
I could rest now,

23:45.926 --> 23:47.360
argue, they didn't make
their burden.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.629
DONNELL: Joey,

23:48.662 --> 23:50.731
things aren't going that well.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.265
You need to put him up there.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.804
BERLUTI: I'll do
whatever you want,

23:57.838 --> 24:01.041
but, Jennifer, we're not going
to win this.

24:01.074 --> 24:02.676
He's prepared to put an army

24:02.709 --> 24:04.878
of lawyers on this.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.079
I think

24:06.112 --> 24:08.048
we should just let it go.

24:08.081 --> 24:10.150
The man rapes me,

24:10.183 --> 24:11.818
and I'm supposed
to just let it go?

24:11.852 --> 24:13.754
(door opens)

24:14.855 --> 24:17.791
(music playing)

24:19.993 --> 24:21.695
Mr. Berluti?

24:21.728 --> 24:22.963
Yes.

24:22.996 --> 24:26.833
(music playing)

24:26.867 --> 24:29.035
First,

24:29.069 --> 24:30.671
I'm going to deny
saying everything

24:30.704 --> 24:32.639
I'm about to tell you.

24:32.673 --> 24:33.607
Okay.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.845
I don't know if Mr. Mathis did

24:38.879 --> 24:40.480
what you're saying he did.

24:42.082 --> 24:45.385
But there's a junior partner
at my firm,

24:45.418 --> 24:48.288
he keeps asking me
what's going on.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.090
It's like he's too interested,
you know?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.962
I think he knows something.

24:55.996 --> 24:56.863
What's his name?

24:56.897 --> 24:59.833
(music playing)

25:07.741 --> 25:10.076
PAULINE: Like I say,

25:10.110 --> 25:11.845
we never had this conversation.

25:19.452 --> 25:21.387
Jimmy,

25:21.421 --> 25:22.388
draft a complaint.

25:22.422 --> 25:24.558
Move for an emergency
deposition to be taken

25:24.591 --> 25:26.893
prior to filing the complaint.

25:26.927 --> 25:28.228
Can you do that?

25:28.261 --> 25:28.995
YOUNG: But if there's
a danger,

25:29.029 --> 25:30.463
the evidence could be lost.

25:30.496 --> 25:31.665
This junior partner will have

25:31.698 --> 25:33.199
a lot of pressure
put on him.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.235
You need to get him
in a room now

25:35.268 --> 25:36.570
and put him under oath.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.540
(music playing)

25:45.579 --> 25:47.881
Why not just file
the complaint, Counsel?

25:47.914 --> 25:49.650
BERLUTI: We're happy
to do that, Your Honor.

25:49.683 --> 25:51.151
I would think the defendant

25:51.184 --> 25:52.686
would seek to explore ways

25:52.719 --> 25:54.320
of making this go away

25:54.354 --> 25:55.188
before we file

25:55.221 --> 25:57.290
since filing makes it
public record.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.925
That kind of threat

25:58.959 --> 26:00.794
is evidence of the extortion.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.696
Look, I have the automatic right

26:02.729 --> 26:05.098
to depose him after we sue.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.633
We're happy to take that route.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.501
WARREN: Mr. Berluti,
don't insult me.

26:08.535 --> 26:10.837
The only reason
you're not formally suing

26:10.871 --> 26:12.506
is because by doing so,

26:12.539 --> 26:13.339
your card is played,

26:13.373 --> 26:15.275
and you'll lose leverage.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.477
This thing
has a bad stench to it.

26:17.511 --> 26:19.713
But, Mr. Miles,

26:19.746 --> 26:20.881
it's not a question

26:20.914 --> 26:23.316
as to whether he can depose
this lawyer.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.786
This motion only covers timing.

26:25.819 --> 26:28.589
We're even willing to come
to your place.

26:28.622 --> 26:30.991
WARREN: I'm going to allow
the deposition.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.125
But, Mr. Berluti,

26:32.158 --> 26:33.560
like I say,

26:33.594 --> 26:35.061
I don't like the stench.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.700
We had gone to a club.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.234
At 6:00 PM?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.603
That's a little early,
isn't it?

26:42.636 --> 26:44.605
It was an underground club,

26:44.638 --> 26:45.872
mostly gay.

26:45.906 --> 26:47.240
But a lot of heterosexuals

26:47.273 --> 26:48.408
went there primarily

26:48.441 --> 26:49.109
to have sex.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.912
They had sex in the club?
Yes.

26:51.945 --> 26:52.813
HERIC: And you
and Jean Homestead

26:52.846 --> 26:53.680
went to this club

26:53.714 --> 26:55.248
on the night of the murder?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.783
Yes.

26:56.817 --> 26:58.351
HERIC: Daniel,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.621
what did you do there?

27:00.654 --> 27:02.723
We danced,

27:02.756 --> 27:04.057
we made love.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.692
What time did you leave?

27:05.726 --> 27:08.028
Probably around 8:00 or 9:00.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.896
I drove her home.

27:09.930 --> 27:10.964
HERIC: Did you go inside?

27:10.997 --> 27:12.198
No,

27:12.232 --> 27:12.999
I dropped her off

27:13.033 --> 27:14.400
then I went home.

27:14.434 --> 27:15.902
HERIC: You never went back

27:15.936 --> 27:17.470
to her house?
No.

27:17.504 --> 27:19.472
HERIC: Well, did you receive
her phone message?

27:19.506 --> 27:20.841
DANIEL: No,
that message was left

27:20.874 --> 27:22.242
on my business cell,

27:22.275 --> 27:23.677
which she would know

27:23.710 --> 27:25.378
I wouldn't get.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.247
That message was left
to set me up.

27:27.280 --> 27:27.981
Objection.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.115
Sustained.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.851
HERIC: Then, what about those

27:30.884 --> 27:33.086
microscopic traces of blood

27:33.119 --> 27:34.387
that were found in the backseat

27:34.420 --> 27:35.155
of your car?

27:35.188 --> 27:38.324
I have no idea.

27:38.358 --> 27:39.492
She'd certainly been

27:39.526 --> 27:40.894
in the backseat of my car

27:40.927 --> 27:42.028
many times.
We'd--

27:42.062 --> 27:43.597
Sometimes we even made
love there.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.334
Anybody see you

27:48.368 --> 27:50.470
and Mrs. Homestead
at this club?

27:50.504 --> 27:52.305
I'm sure people did

27:52.338 --> 27:53.640
but no one's come forward.

27:53.674 --> 27:56.142
It's funny how
not one waitress,

27:56.176 --> 27:56.977
not one bartender,

27:57.010 --> 27:58.211
not one patron

27:58.244 --> 28:00.113
remembers seeing you there.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.548
It's a pretty crowded place.

28:01.582 --> 28:03.283
Any witnesses to establish

28:03.316 --> 28:04.685
that you were home alone

28:04.718 --> 28:05.619
the night of the murder?

28:05.652 --> 28:06.987
Well, if there were witnesses,

28:07.020 --> 28:08.889
I wouldn't have been alone.

28:08.922 --> 28:10.691
Ever been convicted
of a felony,

28:10.724 --> 28:11.625
Mr. Carrington?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.662
(music playing)

28:19.465 --> 28:22.068
Once.

28:22.102 --> 28:23.136
Many years ago.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.538
What was it?

28:26.640 --> 28:28.575
Assault.
ROLAND: Assault and battery.

28:28.609 --> 28:29.810
You beat up a girlfriend,

28:29.843 --> 28:31.077
didn't you, Mr. Carrington?

28:31.111 --> 28:32.312
I pushed her.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.047
ROLAND: Pushed her
and she was hospitalized

28:34.080 --> 28:36.249
with three broken ribs,

28:36.282 --> 28:37.584
wasn't she, Mr. Carrington?

28:39.520 --> 28:42.455
(music playing)

28:48.862 --> 28:51.264
Did you know
about that conviction?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.033
HERIC: So what?
He was only 19 at the time.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.467
It doesn't matter.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.836
That felony was reason enough

28:55.869 --> 28:57.638
to keep him off the stand.

28:57.671 --> 28:58.772
HERIC: You told me
to put him on.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.674
DONNELL: We didn't know
he beat up a former girlfriend.

29:00.707 --> 29:02.676
HERIC: Well, the jury
had to hear his story.

29:02.709 --> 29:03.644
DONNELL: How about you
letting us in

29:03.677 --> 29:05.311
on all the facts from now on?

29:06.713 --> 29:09.716
Just help me prepare
my closing.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.217
We'll meet you back
at the office.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.761
I have no information
whatsoever.

29:20.794 --> 29:21.928
What's your relationship

29:21.962 --> 29:23.263
with Mr. Mathis?

29:23.296 --> 29:24.731
I work with him.
We're both lawyers

29:24.765 --> 29:25.832
in the same firm.

29:25.866 --> 29:27.167
BERLUTI:
Do you socialize together?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.334
MARK: No, we do not.

29:28.368 --> 29:30.436
Were you in the
Palmer House Hotel

29:30.470 --> 29:32.338
on the evening of April 12th?

29:32.372 --> 29:34.274
No, I was not.

29:34.307 --> 29:35.275
BERLUTI: Do you have
any information

29:35.308 --> 29:36.442
concerning the events

29:36.476 --> 29:37.911
involving Mr. Mathis

29:37.944 --> 29:38.812
on April 12th?

29:38.845 --> 29:39.646
Asked and answered.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.115
MARK: I will answer it again.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.917
I don't know
what you're talking about,

29:43.950 --> 29:45.852
and I have no information.

29:47.721 --> 29:49.189
Do you know Jennifer Cole?

29:49.222 --> 29:50.557
No, I do not.

29:50.591 --> 29:52.158
Ever heard of her before?

29:52.192 --> 29:53.527
Only in connection

29:53.560 --> 29:54.427
with this lawsuit.

29:59.499 --> 30:00.601
Okay.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.703
We're done.

30:02.736 --> 30:03.904
You can go, Mark.

30:06.206 --> 30:07.407
You also, please.

30:12.045 --> 30:13.046
If you go forward

30:13.079 --> 30:15.481
with this lawsuit,
Mr. Berluti,

30:15.516 --> 30:16.917
this is the counterclaim

30:16.950 --> 30:18.685
that awaits you.

30:18.719 --> 30:20.253
Never mind abuse of process.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.622
There are counts of libel,

30:21.655 --> 30:23.023
defamation of character.

30:23.056 --> 30:25.659
You can't sue me for what I
allege in a complaint.

30:25.692 --> 30:27.360
MATHIS: Oh, we will.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.695
And, truthfully,
I hope we lose

30:28.729 --> 30:30.396
the first go-round.

30:30.430 --> 30:31.297
That'll give us a chance

30:31.331 --> 30:32.599
to go to the appeals court,

30:32.633 --> 30:35.435
possibly the S. J. C.

30:35.468 --> 30:36.670
I hope you like working

30:36.703 --> 30:38.572
on this case, Mr. Berluti,

30:38.605 --> 30:41.207
because for the next
three years,

30:41.241 --> 30:43.076
you'll have time
for little else.

30:44.978 --> 30:47.013
(door opens)

30:47.047 --> 30:48.048
Sorry we're late.

30:48.081 --> 30:49.783
We were held up in court,
and we all wanted

30:49.816 --> 30:51.552
to come over together.
What is this?

30:51.585 --> 30:53.854
YOUNG: This is an army,
Mr. Mathis.

30:53.887 --> 30:56.823
(music playing)

31:01.962 --> 31:03.296
YOUNG: See, you may have thought
to yourself,

31:03.329 --> 31:05.065
"Nobody's gonna take up
the cause

31:05.098 --> 31:06.700
of a lowly prostitute,"

31:06.733 --> 31:08.468
but you were wrong.

31:08.501 --> 31:10.871
Jennifer Cole is a friend
of this firm.

31:10.904 --> 31:12.506
We care about Jennifer Cole.

31:12.539 --> 31:14.340
We stand committed
to exercising

31:14.374 --> 31:15.709
Jennifer Cole's rights.

31:15.742 --> 31:18.311
I guess what I'm trying
to say, Mr. Mathis,

31:18.344 --> 31:20.080
if you want a war,

31:20.113 --> 31:22.348
you've got one.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.817
MATHIS: You think
you're ready to challenge

31:23.850 --> 31:25.652
the resources
of this law firm?

31:25.686 --> 31:27.187
Do some research.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.955
We've been up
against big firms before

31:28.989 --> 31:31.758
and beaten them
for a lot of money.

31:31.792 --> 31:34.494
A reputation
is a terrible thing to waste,

31:34.528 --> 31:36.062
Mr. Mathis.

31:36.096 --> 31:37.864
You people are what give lawyers

31:37.898 --> 31:39.332
a bad name.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.101
WASHINGTON:
No, lawyers who rape

31:41.134 --> 31:42.903
give us a bad name.

31:42.936 --> 31:43.837
DONNELL: Look,

31:43.870 --> 31:45.171
we can fight

31:45.205 --> 31:46.607
or we can settle this,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.441
but like Eugene Young said,

31:48.474 --> 31:50.176
if it's a fight you want,

31:50.210 --> 31:51.845
you're in for a big one.

31:51.878 --> 31:54.180
And, win or lose,

31:54.214 --> 31:55.448
you lose.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.451
(music playing)

32:05.025 --> 32:07.961
(music playing)

32:13.233 --> 32:16.402
$175,000,

32:16.436 --> 32:19.139
all conditioned
on total confidentiality.

32:21.141 --> 32:23.109
A hundred and seventy-five
thousand?

32:23.143 --> 32:24.911
I think we should take it.

32:24.945 --> 32:26.680
Okay.

32:26.713 --> 32:29.315
We'll have the check tomorrow.

32:29.349 --> 32:30.316
Thank you.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.053
Thank you.

32:33.086 --> 32:34.054
Thank you all.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.762
But, Jennifer, listen.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.802
This guy, Mathis,

32:48.835 --> 32:51.104
if he's capable of rape,

32:51.137 --> 32:53.239
we just left him pretty hot.

32:53.273 --> 32:54.808
I don't want you ever...

32:54.841 --> 32:56.677
going back to the Palmer House.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.645
I won't.

32:58.679 --> 33:00.246
BERLUTI: You have a little girl,
Jennifer.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.015
She needs you.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.183
The other night,

33:03.216 --> 33:04.217
you could have been killed.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.822
You need to start over.

33:08.855 --> 33:12.025
I will, Jimmy,

33:12.058 --> 33:13.126
and not just for her,

33:13.159 --> 33:14.595
but for you.

33:14.628 --> 33:15.929
You don't owe me nothing.

33:15.962 --> 33:18.298
I owe you my life, Jimmy,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.501
and I'll never forget it.

33:23.570 --> 33:26.507
(music playing)

33:37.483 --> 33:38.318
ROLAND: She told her husband

33:38.351 --> 33:40.821
she feared Daniel Carrington,

33:40.854 --> 33:42.756
feared that he might hurt her,

33:42.789 --> 33:45.091
and she's found dead.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.860
Dead with traces
of Daniel Carrington's

33:46.893 --> 33:48.428
semen in her.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.362
Her blood is found

33:49.395 --> 33:51.131
in Daniel Carrington's car.

33:51.164 --> 33:52.899
Come on.

33:52.933 --> 33:54.367
He previously beat up

33:54.400 --> 33:57.203
and hospitalized
another girlfriend.

33:57.237 --> 33:58.238
All the evidence

33:58.271 --> 34:00.173
in this case points to him,

34:00.206 --> 34:01.975
and what's his story?

34:02.008 --> 34:04.110
They made love in a bar?

34:05.846 --> 34:07.581
Nobody saw them in this bar,

34:07.614 --> 34:09.315
not one patron,

34:09.349 --> 34:11.451
not one waitress or bartender.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.485
There was a message

34:13.520 --> 34:14.621
from the victim

34:14.655 --> 34:16.255
breaking off the relationship.

34:16.289 --> 34:17.558
A message...

34:17.591 --> 34:19.693
to the defendant
left one hour

34:19.726 --> 34:21.895
before she was murdered.

34:21.928 --> 34:25.031
There is no doubt here,

34:25.065 --> 34:27.634
ladies and gentlemen.

34:27.668 --> 34:29.268
Daniel Carrington

34:29.302 --> 34:31.271
murdered Jean Homestead.

34:41.147 --> 34:43.049
I certainly understand
the theory

34:43.083 --> 34:44.985
that Danny did it.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.520
His sperm,

34:46.553 --> 34:47.688
the blood,

34:47.721 --> 34:49.155
phone message,

34:49.188 --> 34:50.524
it makes perfect sense

34:50.556 --> 34:51.925
to jump to that conclusion,

34:51.958 --> 34:52.693
doesn't it?

34:52.726 --> 34:54.695
But we don't jump
to conclusions

34:54.728 --> 34:56.161
in murder trials.

34:56.196 --> 34:59.499
The evidence
has to establish guilt

34:59.533 --> 35:01.902
beyond all reasonable doubt.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.738
Now, have they really done
so here?

35:04.771 --> 35:06.507
They certainly didn't rule out

35:06.540 --> 35:08.174
that they made love at the club

35:08.208 --> 35:12.078
or that Danny was alone at home.

35:12.112 --> 35:13.279
And let's face it.

35:13.313 --> 35:15.415
We really can't rule out
the husband,

35:15.448 --> 35:16.182
can we?

35:16.216 --> 35:18.184
He had motive,

35:18.218 --> 35:19.686
opportunity,

35:19.720 --> 35:21.421
no alibi.

35:21.454 --> 35:22.589
What about the stepson,

35:22.623 --> 35:23.690
for that matter?

35:23.724 --> 35:25.291
Hmm? Any stepson

35:25.325 --> 35:28.862
embroiled in an Oedipal affair

35:28.895 --> 35:31.898
is certainly capable
of twisted turns.

35:31.932 --> 35:34.300
It doesn't even stop there.

35:34.334 --> 35:35.936
Suppose Danny Carrington

35:35.969 --> 35:38.939
had another lover.

35:38.972 --> 35:41.474
No evidence, to be sure,
but they

35:41.508 --> 35:43.209
didn't even investigate that.

35:43.243 --> 35:46.412
And is it really
that far-fetched?

35:46.446 --> 35:47.714
The other lover

35:47.748 --> 35:49.916
gets wind of the little session

35:49.950 --> 35:51.785
at the club,

35:51.818 --> 35:54.521
goes to the victim's house,

35:54.555 --> 35:56.022
threatens her,

35:56.056 --> 35:58.725
forces her to make
that phone call

35:58.759 --> 36:00.360
to implicate Danny.

36:00.393 --> 36:03.396
Then he or she kills the woman,

36:03.429 --> 36:04.698
dumps her in the alley,

36:04.731 --> 36:06.366
knowing full well

36:06.399 --> 36:09.503
who the police will blame.

36:09.536 --> 36:11.171
He or she even plants

36:11.204 --> 36:13.674
that little blood speck
in his car.

36:16.076 --> 36:20.113
Now, Danny is
the obvious suspect,

36:20.146 --> 36:22.849
but it could have been anybody,

36:22.883 --> 36:24.250
maybe one of you,

36:26.486 --> 36:28.088
maybe the judge,

36:31.558 --> 36:32.593
maybe me.

36:32.626 --> 36:35.562
(music playing)

36:38.031 --> 36:38.799
Now,

36:38.832 --> 36:39.866
could have been a bonehead,

36:39.900 --> 36:41.835
stupid murder by Danny

36:42.936 --> 36:45.405
or one of the more
perfect variety

36:45.438 --> 36:47.941
by somebody else to frame him,

36:47.974 --> 36:49.510
the husband,

36:49.543 --> 36:50.844
the stepson,

36:50.877 --> 36:52.646
a female lover,

36:52.679 --> 36:54.615
a big, gay,

36:54.648 --> 36:56.850
sick lover, anybody.

36:58.184 --> 37:00.220
The simple truth is,

37:01.555 --> 37:03.524
we don't know,

37:03.557 --> 37:05.158
certainly not beyond

37:05.191 --> 37:07.828
all reasonable doubt.

37:09.395 --> 37:12.332
(music playing)

37:39.626 --> 37:41.427
They sent you with the check?

37:41.461 --> 37:44.731
No, the check is coming
by messenger.

37:44.765 --> 37:48.602
May I see you in private,
Mr. Berluti?

37:48.635 --> 37:50.571
(door locks)

37:53.339 --> 37:55.542
I'm a man of conscience,

37:55.576 --> 37:56.643
which made yesterday

37:56.677 --> 37:58.444
one of the most difficult days
in my life.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.917
I lied in my deposition,
Mr. Berluti.

38:05.218 --> 38:06.252
I had a hunch.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.589
I don't think you had this
particular hunch.

38:11.191 --> 38:12.458
About six weeks ago,

38:12.492 --> 38:13.560
I met Jennifer Cole

38:13.594 --> 38:15.095
in the Palmer House.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.029
She passed herself off

38:16.062 --> 38:18.699
as a young advertising
executive.

38:18.732 --> 38:21.034
We got a room, we made love,

38:21.067 --> 38:22.435
after which, she informed me

38:22.468 --> 38:24.470
that she was a prostitute

38:24.505 --> 38:26.740
and if I didn't give her
$10,000,

38:26.773 --> 38:29.643
she would tell my wife

38:29.676 --> 38:31.645
or cry "Rape."

38:35.749 --> 38:36.917
Here's a copy of my check.

38:41.121 --> 38:42.122
There's nothing to be done now.

38:42.155 --> 38:44.390
Your case is settled.

38:44.424 --> 38:45.425
But these are people

38:45.458 --> 38:46.760
with families,

38:46.793 --> 38:49.162
Mr. Berluti.

38:49.195 --> 38:51.798
It's difficult for me
to stay quiet

38:51.832 --> 38:53.834
knowing she's going
to do this again.

38:56.102 --> 38:59.039
(door opens and closes)

39:06.312 --> 39:07.447
Did you kill her?

39:07.480 --> 39:09.616
HERIC: Bobby, I was throwing out
a hypothetical.

39:09.650 --> 39:11.217
DONNELL:
I don't think so, Joey.

39:11.251 --> 39:14.354
This totally fits
your narcissistic disorder.

39:14.387 --> 39:15.789
The only reason
we were at that table

39:15.822 --> 39:18.058
was to be an audience
for that smile.

39:18.091 --> 39:19.425
You did it,

39:19.459 --> 39:21.094
and you wanted us to know
you did it.

39:21.127 --> 39:22.729
HERIC: You've been watching
too much television.

39:22.763 --> 39:24.565
DONNELL: Did you and Danny
used to be lovers?

39:24.598 --> 39:26.166
Well, now that you mention it,

39:26.199 --> 39:28.735
that's how I got the case.

39:28.769 --> 39:29.736
DONNELL: I'm going to the D. A.

39:29.770 --> 39:31.137
HERIC: Oh, please, Bobby.

39:31.171 --> 39:32.539
The jury's out.

39:32.573 --> 39:34.007
If we win,
you've got nothing to say.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.709
If we lose,

39:35.742 --> 39:37.210
well, D. A. s just love

39:37.243 --> 39:38.411
to throw out convictions,
don't they?

39:38.444 --> 39:40.413
I'm sure he'll be thrilled
to listen.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.948
FRUTT: I think you wanna lose.

39:41.982 --> 39:44.317
That's why you put your guy
on the stand

39:44.350 --> 39:46.019
with a felony conviction

39:46.052 --> 39:47.588
and that closing?
HERIC: Well, wait, wait.

39:47.621 --> 39:48.955
What was wrong
with my closing?

39:48.989 --> 39:50.290
FRUTT: It was ridiculous.

39:50.323 --> 39:51.558
"Maybe the judge did it,

39:51.592 --> 39:52.492
maybe a juror did it?"

39:52.526 --> 39:54.260
I also said,
"Maybe the lawyer did it."

39:54.294 --> 39:56.062
That part, you seem to believe.

39:56.096 --> 39:56.730
DONNELL: You killed her.

39:56.763 --> 39:57.397
HERIC: Bobby,

39:57.430 --> 40:01.301
Bobby (chuckles) Bobby,

40:01.334 --> 40:03.269
you think I'm evil?

40:03.303 --> 40:05.005
DONNELL: You murdered his lover,

40:05.038 --> 40:06.439
framed him,

40:06.472 --> 40:07.908
got yourself put on
as his lawyer

40:07.941 --> 40:10.176
to guarantee he goes away.

40:11.812 --> 40:13.647
Well, I must say, it does sound

40:13.680 --> 40:15.081
worthy of me.

40:15.115 --> 40:18.084
(music playing)

40:23.456 --> 40:24.390
Hi, everybody.

40:29.229 --> 40:30.831
(laughs) What's the matter?

40:33.834 --> 40:35.101
The name "Mark Greene"

40:35.135 --> 40:36.903
didn't ring a bell with you,
Jennifer?

40:39.673 --> 40:40.741
You cashed his check.

40:45.211 --> 40:46.980
You did the same thing to him

40:47.013 --> 40:48.214
you did to Mathis.

40:52.753 --> 40:54.955
Here's your check.

40:54.988 --> 40:56.489
Take it,

40:56.523 --> 40:57.924
walk out of this office,

40:57.958 --> 40:59.425
and never come back here again.

41:01.862 --> 41:03.697
These people are rich, Jimmy.

41:05.098 --> 41:06.600
It's expensive

41:06.633 --> 41:08.134
raising a child, and...

41:08.168 --> 41:10.036
BERLUTI: The biggest problem
your child has

41:10.070 --> 41:11.805
is having you for a mother.

41:14.808 --> 41:18.078
If I hear of this happening
ever again,

41:18.111 --> 41:20.213
I'll go to the police

41:20.246 --> 41:22.315
and to Social Services

41:22.348 --> 41:24.217
to take that child away
from you.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.154
Take the check,

41:28.188 --> 41:29.122
walk out,

41:29.155 --> 41:30.824
and never come back.

41:30.857 --> 41:33.794
(music playing)

41:55.649 --> 41:56.917
I'm so nervous.

41:56.950 --> 41:58.451
PATRICK: Will the defendant
please rise?

42:01.988 --> 42:03.089
Madam foreperson,

42:03.123 --> 42:06.059
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

42:06.092 --> 42:07.360
We have, Your Honor.

42:07.393 --> 42:09.195
What say you?

42:09.229 --> 42:10.597
FOREPERSON: In the matter
of the Commonwealth

42:10.631 --> 42:12.365
versus Daniel Carrington,

42:12.398 --> 42:13.934
on the charge of murder

42:13.967 --> 42:15.602
in the first degree,

42:15.636 --> 42:17.337
we, the jury,
find the defendant,

42:17.370 --> 42:19.940
Daniel Carrington,

42:19.973 --> 42:20.907
guilty.

42:24.778 --> 42:25.846
HERIC: We will appeal,
Your Honor.

42:25.879 --> 42:26.913
So noted.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.014
Members of the jury,

42:28.048 --> 42:29.082
this completes your service.

42:29.115 --> 42:30.817
Security, will you take

42:30.851 --> 42:32.385
the defendant into custody?

42:32.418 --> 42:33.419
We're hereby adjourned.

42:33.453 --> 42:35.756
(gavel bangs)

42:35.789 --> 42:36.890
HERIC: Danny, listen,
don't lose hope.

42:36.923 --> 42:38.825
We will keep trying.
But what happens now, right?

42:38.859 --> 42:39.760
HERIC: We're gonna come
right in.

42:39.793 --> 42:41.528
We're gonna start talking
about our appeal.

42:41.562 --> 42:43.429
Now, Danny, don't lose hope.

42:43.463 --> 42:44.931
Don't lose hope, Danny.

42:44.965 --> 42:45.932
Remember,

42:45.966 --> 42:47.167
in the end,

42:47.200 --> 42:48.234
it's a good world.

42:53.540 --> 42:54.374
Well,

42:54.407 --> 42:57.243
I guess you can't win them all.

42:57.277 --> 43:00.146
If I can figure out a way
to reveal what I know, I will.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.281
HERIC: Certainly you know
the allegation

43:01.314 --> 43:03.316
that I tried to lose a case

43:03.349 --> 43:05.351
would be libel, per se.

43:06.787 --> 43:08.955
Listen, come on,
sometimes you have to accept

43:08.989 --> 43:10.891
unfortunate outcomes.

43:10.924 --> 43:13.760
All part of being a lawyer,
isn't it?

43:13.794 --> 43:16.029
Right, Ellie?

43:16.062 --> 43:17.063
Well, if you'll excuse me,

43:17.097 --> 43:19.099
I'm wanna go try to dig up
some new clients.

43:19.132 --> 43:21.501
(chuckles)

43:21.535 --> 43:23.904
Till we meet again.

43:23.937 --> 43:26.873
(music playing)

43:46.727 --> 43:49.530
(music playing)

44:13.053 --> 44:14.420
WOMAN: You stinker.
