WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:04.607
Babe, what kind of candy
do you think we'd be for Halloween?

00:04.727 --> 00:07.087
I don't want to be that
toothbrush apple family.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.215
I was thinking about doing raisins.

00:09.335 --> 00:11.940
Fruit? No. We need butterfingers
up in this bitch.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.980
- We need a variety pack.
- What do you think of this?

00:14.448 --> 00:17.227
Oh, I like that. Super sexy with that

00:17.347 --> 00:19.168
pair of fishnets and some Maryjanes...

00:19.288 --> 00:20.572
I just want to rip
that thing right off you.

00:20.692 --> 00:22.865
Does it rip off easily?
I want to ravage you.

00:22.985 --> 00:24.964
This is Ellie's brownie uniform.

00:25.084 --> 00:27.317
I was just sawing
the friendship patch on.

00:27.437 --> 00:29.660
Oh, God. Oh my God.

00:29.973 --> 00:33.194
- I'm the creepy guy now. - I can wear
something like this for Halloween sweetie.

00:33.314 --> 00:35.403
- It's just... It's ruined. It's over.
- Really?

00:35.523 --> 00:38.050
- How am I gonna delete this
from my yank bank? - What?

00:38.170 --> 00:42.209
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:42.210 --> 00:46.788
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't sexy Brownie
 one of the staples in college?

00:46.908 --> 00:50.178
Along with sexy nurse
and sexy postal worker.

00:50.298 --> 00:51.768
And sexy museum curator?

00:51.888 --> 00:53.445
Aw, that's terrible.

00:54.324 --> 00:56.949
Ellie, do me a favor... don't put
that in your mouth, sweetheart.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.618
It looks like a meatball.
They're not meatballs, Taco.

00:59.686 --> 01:01.653
Halloween used to be
my favorite holiday.

01:01.721 --> 01:05.387
'Cause not only was promiscuity and crimes
tolerated, they were actually encouraged.

01:05.507 --> 01:06.358
Yeah.

01:06.426 --> 01:08.126
Adult Halloween is still here.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.962
You just can't enjoy
it when you have kids.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.798
I just wish that we
could combine Halloweens.

01:12.865 --> 01:13.532
Amen.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.701
You guys are already trying to
do that with Jenny and Ellie

01:15.768 --> 01:16.802
sharing the same costume.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.037
Oh, I'm so glad that
I don't have a girl.

01:19.105 --> 01:20.038
You are so lucky.

01:20.106 --> 01:22.374
You have a son, and you only
have to worry about one dick.

01:22.442 --> 01:22.941
Yeah.

01:23.009 --> 01:25.644
When you have a daughter, you have
to worry about everybody's dick.

01:25.712 --> 01:27.312
There's so many dicks around here.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.817
Can we stop talking about your
children's genitalia for a second?

01:29.937 --> 01:32.599
Because I think we have more
important matters at hand.

01:32.719 --> 01:35.220
How you feeling about your match-up
this week with Uncle Pete?

01:35.288 --> 01:37.656
Oh, Uncle Pete is going to
get destroyed this week.

01:37.724 --> 01:38.824
Oh, hardly.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.792
In fact, I've got an idea for you.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.527
What if you set my lineup this week?

01:42.595 --> 01:44.329
You're going to let
me pick your lineup?

01:44.397 --> 01:46.732
Mm-hmm, you can't do any
add/drops, but you can put

01:46.799 --> 01:49.134
anyone from my bench into the
starting lineup, and I am

01:49.202 --> 01:51.036
confident I will still crush you.

01:51.104 --> 01:52.004
Holy shit.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.740
You just made a huge
mistake, my friend.

01:54.807 --> 01:57.542
Wait a minute, are you really going
to put your fate in his hands?

01:57.610 --> 01:59.645
No, I'm going to put
his fate in his hands.

01:59.712 --> 02:01.246
Geez, I like it.

02:01.314 --> 02:02.147
I got to get out of here.

02:02.215 --> 02:03.148
I'm gonna get me some pumpkins.

02:03.216 --> 02:04.149
I'm gonna get the car.

02:04.217 --> 02:05.817
Come on, Ellie, time to go, baby.

02:05.885 --> 02:07.352
Come on, Taco, it's time to go, buddy.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.887
Aw, we're not done
playing with the monkey.

02:08.955 --> 02:09.920
We have to go home now.

02:09.989 --> 02:12.024
All right, fine, we're coming.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.359
Enjoy your pumpkin.

02:14.427 --> 02:15.060
Hi.

02:15.128 --> 02:15.861
Hi.

02:15.928 --> 02:19.164
You're never going to believe this,
but I want to buy a pumpkin.

02:19.232 --> 02:22.167
By the way, you are a
very authentic witch.

02:22.235 --> 02:23.168
Thank you.

02:23.236 --> 02:24.693
I like your necklace, too.

02:24.813 --> 02:28.316
Oh, it's actually a talisman
to ward off evil thoughts.

02:31.177 --> 02:32.878
Nope, not working. Sorry.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.746
Did you think that one
was going to work?

02:34.814 --> 02:35.847
I think it did.

02:35.915 --> 02:37.015
Ah.

02:37.083 --> 02:40.285
Saw you talking to a
girl at the petting zoo.

02:40.353 --> 02:41.019
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41.087 --> 02:41.687
Got her digits, man.

02:41.754 --> 02:42.454
She's a cute witch.

02:42.522 --> 02:44.122
All right, Pete. Whoo.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.724
Ride her broomstick, right?

02:45.792 --> 02:46.958
That's just stupid.

02:47.026 --> 02:48.093
As well as this music.

02:48.161 --> 02:49.127
What is this?

02:49.195 --> 02:50.195
Guys, it's Pandora.

02:50.263 --> 02:51.163
It picked itself.

02:51.230 --> 02:52.698
Yeah, but Pandora's actually cool.

02:52.765 --> 02:55.808
What could you possibly have put into
it that made that come out of it?

02:56.363 --> 02:59.086
- Kesha.
- Hey guys. Check it out.

02:59.206 --> 03:01.570
Whoa whoa whoa.

03:02.773 --> 03:04.475
- Monkey.
- What are you doing with the monkey?

03:04.595 --> 03:06.050
I stole it from the petting zoo.

03:06.170 --> 03:07.786
Highly illegal, but very fun.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.887
Monkeys do not like me.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.089
That's Andre. Monkey, Andre.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.256
You want to come over here?

03:11.324 --> 03:12.224
Andre... and this is Pete.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.125
Come on over, man.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.526
All right, he's getting
a little skittish.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.096
We might want to just...
Yeah, I think he doesn't like the music.

03:17.163 --> 03:17.963
The music is fine.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.131
No, the music... Change it!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.066
Stop yelling at the driver!

03:21.101 --> 03:22.101
He's on my shoulder!

03:22.168 --> 03:22.868
He's freaking out!

03:22.936 --> 03:23.335
Whoa.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.336
Guys, he's freaking out.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.337
Guys, it's the music.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.039
He's rebelling against the music.

03:27.107 --> 03:27.773
Is that Goo Goo Dolls?

03:27.841 --> 03:29.575
No Savage Garden.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.743
Oh, much worse, much worse.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.844
He's attacking me.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.045
No, no, no!

03:33.113 --> 03:35.047
He's freaking out.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.015
Just grab him, just grab him.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.217
He's trying to kill us all.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.419
He just bared his teeth at me.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.607
The monkey... no!

03:42.727 --> 03:44.526
- Oops.
- Oh, my God, I think we just killed him.

03:44.617 --> 03:45.547
We didn't kill it, okay?

03:45.615 --> 03:46.448
Monkeys land on their feet.

03:46.516 --> 03:47.616
They're like masturbating cats.

03:47.717 --> 03:48.784
No, no, no, we killed it.

03:48.851 --> 03:50.819
And it's going to haunt us forever.

03:50.887 --> 03:51.787
You know what?

03:51.854 --> 03:54.256
Just calm down and groove out.

03:55.525 --> 03:59.378
What?
You guys don't like Reggaeton?

04:02.043 --> 04:05.859
Oh, Pete, I'm going to
tear into your lineup.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.514
<i>I feel like Jessica Tandy in
Fried Green Tomatoes, except</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:10.449
without the old lesbian stuff.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.720
Oh, Chris Johnson, I think you'll
be spending the week on the bench.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.555
And what about you, Pierre Thomas?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.524
Playing against the Pittsburgh D.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.761
You will be staying in the ga...
Wait, but what if he vultures a

04:21.827 --> 04:23.462
couple touchdowns?

04:23.530 --> 04:24.397
He could have a big week.

04:24.464 --> 04:25.264
I should take him out.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.233
No, that's what Pete wants me to do.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.035
Pete wants me to take him out.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.105
Oh, just...
just trust your instincts, Ruxin.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.106
Keep it as is.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.542
Don't rock the boat.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.713
Aw.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.748
The answer's in here.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.750
And I'm going to sniff it out.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.820
The hound dog's on the prowl.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.463
I don't really feel like doing
the kid thing with all of

04:57.531 --> 04:59.398
Ellie's friends over here...
No, no.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.100
...and there's candy
stuck everywhere.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.068
Here's the best part.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.970
I'm not talking about a kid party.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.739
I'm talking about an
adult Halloween party.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.473
Seriously?

05:07.541 --> 05:08.941
Yes. We marry the two worlds.

05:09.009 --> 05:09.942
You know what I'll do?

05:10.010 --> 05:10.943
I'll get a little booze cart.

05:11.011 --> 05:11.577
Yeah.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.412
So we go trick-or-treating
around the neighborhood... we got

05:13.480 --> 05:14.470
Tootsie Rolls and tonic.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.271
- I think this sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

05:16.391 --> 05:18.550
And, I'm thinking costumewise...

05:19.028 --> 05:20.224
I'm going whored-up.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.253
Show what Mama gave you.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.021
Right?

05:22.089 --> 05:23.255
Can I make a suggestion?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.191
Filthy Vietnamese prostitute.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.193
Now I'm not talking about
one you get on the pier.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.295
I'm talking about one you got to
go down an alley and negotiate

05:29.363 --> 05:30.262
with some guy with no teeth.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.263
I think that's too far.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.131
It's too much?

05:32.199 --> 05:32.865
It's too much.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.166
All right, I'm just spitballing.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.768
Yeah, we'll come up
with something great.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.303
And you're going to have to have me.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.172
I want you right now, based on the fact that...
Hi, little lady.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.040
Look at you.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.608
I'm going to be a princess.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.309
Yes, you are.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.143
The prettiest princess.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.345
And Mommy's going to be a frog.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.715
Well, you know, I was actually
thinking maybe we would

05:49.783 --> 05:54.353
switch it up and maybe I could be
something a little... different.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.622
You said you were going to be a frog.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.359
You could be a princess and I could
be your sexy little handmaid.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.695
No, you promised you'd be a frog.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.397
A big, puffy, fat old frog.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.300
What do you think Daddy should be?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.069
I don't care what Daddy wears.

06:10.137 --> 06:10.970
That's my little girl.

06:11.038 --> 06:11.837
That's why I love you.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.239
I love you, too.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.741
Great. You get to be whatever
you want, and I'm going to be

06:15.809 --> 06:16.909
dressed like a frog.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.044
A fat, old frog.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.912
Thanks.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.081
Come out to the burbs, man.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.416
It's going to be great.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.717
I've got a bar cart this year.

06:24.785 --> 06:29.188
Children's Halloween and adult
Halloween do not mix, okay?

06:29.256 --> 06:30.022
Yes, they do.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.691
Because we can do
everything we did as kids.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.527
We can T.P. houses, shit in bags
and light them on fire and put

06:34.594 --> 06:35.561
them on people's doorsteps.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.830
And when they're stamping them
out, we can stand there laughing

06:37.898 --> 06:38.831
with a martini in our hand.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.767
All right, if we do this, you
got to promise me you're not

06:41.835 --> 06:42.501
going to embarrass me.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.236
'Cause I'm actually
bringing a date this year.

06:44.304 --> 06:44.770
Bring her.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.705
I'll bring a date, too.

06:45.772 --> 06:46.372
Sure you will.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.273
October's my month.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.275
I'm like the Reggie Jackson
of hookups in October.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.276
You're Mrs. October?

06:50.343 --> 06:52.244
All I'm saying is numbers don't lie.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.746
October... boom, I'm spiking.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.283
You keep stats on specific
hookups for a different month?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.453
That's one of the creepiest things
I've ever heard in my life.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.954
It's not creepy. It's an app.

07:02.022 --> 07:02.722
Costs a buck.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.057
You know, this move gets this
much percentage, this move gets

07:05.125 --> 07:05.858
this much percentage.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.392
Move?

07:06.460 --> 07:07.059
Move?

07:07.127 --> 07:07.927
Oh, I got moves.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.762
You're not talking about poor girl?

07:09.830 --> 07:10.396
The poor girl.

07:10.464 --> 07:10.896
Oh, God.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.865
Wait, you're still doing that?
Oh, no.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.300
One of the favorites in the arsenal.

07:14.367 --> 07:14.900
Oh, God!

07:14.968 --> 07:15.634
What?

07:15.702 --> 07:16.435
Andre, no.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.236
The fake sympathy.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.205
"Oh, oh, you lost your phone.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.306
Poor girl, oh."

07:20.373 --> 07:21.741
It works. It worked.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.944
It's just like a slow, creepy
Rophen coming around your shoulder.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.178
That's my ace in the hole.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.880
I have a six percent
success rate with that.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.447
Six percent?

07:28.515 --> 07:29.248
That's really low.

07:29.316 --> 07:29.949
That's very low.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.308
It's not very low.

07:31.428 --> 07:35.022
Hey, buddy. How are you doing
setting my line up for me?

07:35.142 --> 07:37.471
The only thing that's keeping me up
at night is the amount of

07:37.591 --> 07:39.892
options I have to put
together such a crappy team.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.193
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.261
You're still figuring it out?

07:42.329 --> 07:45.397
There are a couple variables that I'm
still weighing just 'cause it's like...

07:45.465 --> 07:46.465
He's in your head.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.066
He's not.

07:47.134 --> 07:47.800
You're rattled.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.868
I'm not rattled at all.

07:48.935 --> 07:49.635
He's not rattled.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.770
It's a very clear choice.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.303
Mm-hmm.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.239
We got Rodgers going up
against the Jets' defense.

07:53.306 --> 07:53.773
Uh-huh.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.374
And we got Favre going
up against the Pats.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.075
Right.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.644
I mean, we all know the right
one to pick, obviously.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.979
Yeah.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.815
Like, what... like, which
one would you play?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.583
Wait...
Are you fishing?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.719
I'm not fishing, buddy, I'm taunting.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.820
In the form of a question?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.456
Yeah, like, how badly am I
gonna beat you this week?

08:10.524 --> 08:14.093
That is the most insecure and rattled
trash talk I've ever seen in my life.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.995
This is such an epic week.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.963
Ruxin loses to Ruxin.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.932
Or Ruxin beats Ruxin.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.900
You poor girl.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.234
Aw, poor girl.

08:22.302 --> 08:22.902
Poor girl.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.438
Guys, I been looking up and down that
highway; not one sign of the monkey.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.239
Oh, my God.

08:27.307 --> 08:27.807
It is dead.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.909
We killed it and it's gonna
come back to haunt us.

08:29.976 --> 08:30.976
We didn't kill the monkey.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.778
It's like a cat, it
landed on its feet.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.780
Guys, you don't know what
we're dealing with, okay?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.849
<i>It's like that movie I Know What
You Did Last Summer, except</i>

08:36.917 --> 08:39.852
instead of a guy with a hook,
we have a young monkey with a

08:39.919 --> 08:42.321
shared hatred for
Andre's taste in music.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.621
It's not my fault.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.690
My music is good.

08:44.758 --> 08:48.294
You told me your favorite singer was
Will Smith, so yes, it is your fault.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.329
That monkey was crazy.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.832
Guys, the monkey is
in your neighborhood.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.200
Be afraid.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.135
Be very afraid.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.136
Ah!

08:57.204 --> 08:58.003
Oh, my gosh.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.305
That guy just spilled my drink.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.673
What a jerk.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.776
Oh, Reggie Jackson is at bat.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.211
Oh, my God, look at this.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.278
Did you just see that?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.947
Yeah, he hit you like a linebacker.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.282
You poor, poor girl. Yes.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.350
Oh, that poor girl.

09:11.418 --> 09:12.451
Let's get you a drink.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.186
You're so sweet.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.888
Oh, you poor girl.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.156
Don't worry about me.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.659
That girl is making a bigger
mistake than playing Percy Harvin.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.127
Right?

09:22.195 --> 09:25.631
Oh, my...
Yo.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.933
Come get it.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.302
Hey.

09:30.370 --> 09:30.903
Hey.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.571
That's a lot of animals.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.072
They yours?

09:33.139 --> 09:33.672
Yep.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.009
So you got ducks and chickens and...
Sheep.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.077
Uh, any other?

09:38.144 --> 09:41.780
Like, uh, I don't know...
giraffes, monkeys.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.783
We used to have a monkey, but
he vanished just the other day.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.018
Really?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.286
That's super weird.

09:47.354 --> 09:52.055
So *

09:52.175 --> 09:53.206
No way.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.162
Most likely, that monkey has
gone to meet his monkey maker.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.164
Ghost monkey.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.167
Did you know the-the
monkey's personality at all?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.169
Is he a happy monkey?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.672
Do you think he had the
capacity to forgive?

10:06.740 --> 10:07.973
Forgive?

10:08.041 --> 10:12.344
I stepped on that monkey's tail one
time, by accident, and he did this!

10:13.914 --> 10:14.513
Yeah!

10:16.000 --> 10:22.074

10:36.269 --> 10:37.870
What'd you think it was, the monkey?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.305
What are you doing out here, Ruxin?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.472
Who do I play?

10:40.540 --> 10:41.840
You want help with your lineup?

10:41.908 --> 10:43.642
No, not for my lineup,
for Pete's lineup.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.510
Where's the answers?

10:44.577 --> 10:45.010
Is it here?

10:45.078 --> 10:45.711
I don't know.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.545
Is it in the trash?

10:46.613 --> 10:47.413
He's driving you crazy.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.314
Do you know the answers?

10:48.381 --> 10:49.248
I don't have the answers.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.049
Where are the answers?

10:50.116 --> 10:50.983
This is what he wants, Ruxin.

10:51.051 --> 10:51.684
What does he want?

10:51.751 --> 10:54.086
He wants you to overthink
this thing and go crazy.

10:54.154 --> 10:54.887
It's not happening.

10:54.955 --> 10:55.387
No.

10:55.455 --> 10:55.888
No.

10:55.956 --> 10:56.388
No.

10:56.456 --> 10:56.889
What?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.612
Okay, Ruxin,

10:59.029 --> 11:02.026
What about one step away from fantasy saw?

11:02.146 --> 11:03.924
Okay, you're gonna cut
your own leg off soon.

11:04.044 --> 11:05.683
- Nobody wants that.
- That's what Pete wants.

11:06.038 --> 11:08.415
Pete wants me to cut my leg off
and play Peter Thomas.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.906
I'm not gonna play Peter Thomas.

11:10.026 --> 11:11.056
I'm not gonna cut my leg off.

11:11.176 --> 11:12.378
I'm not gonna play Peter Thomas.

11:12.498 --> 11:14.657
You're overthinking this thing.
Just put it out of your head.

11:16.032 --> 11:17.678
It's out of my head now.

11:19.408 --> 11:20.618
Is that Percy Harvin?

11:21.258 --> 11:23.354
Was that Williams?

11:23.670 --> 11:24.782
Let's get out of here.

11:24.902 --> 11:27.342
Look, I think this is gonna be
real fun. It is in the suburbs,

11:27.462 --> 11:29.284
but it's like an adult Halloween thing.*

11:29.404 --> 11:31.436
- I actually don't celebrate Halloween.
- Really?

11:31.975 --> 11:33.634
You have like the perfect costume.
What are you talking about?

11:33.754 --> 11:36.124
Oh, it's not a costume.
I am a witch.

11:36.244 --> 11:37.908
- I'm sorry?
- I'm Wiccan.

11:38.028 --> 11:41.022
- Like you're wicking like sweat?
- No, I'm Wicca.

11:41.417 --> 11:42.641
Oh.

11:43.700 --> 11:47.781
- Oh, oh, oh, so okay. You're a real witch.
- Yep.

11:47.901 --> 11:50.173
I literally didn't know
there were real witches.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.580
- Are you ok with that or...
- Um...

11:52.890 --> 11:54.381
- You drink blood?
- No.

11:54.501 --> 11:56.083
- Drink alcohol?
- Yes.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.788
- Alright. Why not?
- Great.

12:01.848 --> 12:03.451
Shit.

12:04.735 --> 12:07.317
Hey... Hey!
Hey, what's up?

12:07.437 --> 12:08.270
Happy Halloween.

12:08.338 --> 12:08.937
Hello.

12:09.005 --> 12:10.305
You remember Lanie from the bar.

12:10.373 --> 12:10.839
Hi. Kevin.

12:10.907 --> 12:11.373
Hi.

12:11.441 --> 12:12.207
Good to see you again.

12:12.275 --> 12:13.141
Nice to see you.

12:13.209 --> 12:14.109
What are you?

12:14.177 --> 12:15.811
Uh, just a little gladiator.

12:15.879 --> 12:18.146
Ah, I thought you were,
like, a fat Russell Crowe.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.715
Really? Thank you.

12:19.782 --> 12:23.001
And you noticed Lanie is dressed like
a-a sexy Brownie.

12:23.121 --> 12:25.807
- Is she? - You can tell
the difference actually because

12:25.927 --> 12:27.561
Brownie costumes don't look like this.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.027
I guess. I'm not sure.

12:29.147 --> 12:30.390
*

12:30.510 --> 12:34.054
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Do you have some ecstasy?

12:34.174 --> 12:35.053
Ecstasy?

12:35.173 --> 12:38.053
Um, I can get you some vodka.
Do you like vodka?

12:38.173 --> 12:40.583
Sometimes I black out when I drink vodka.

12:40.703 --> 12:41.536
Whatever you want.

12:41.604 --> 12:43.705
Adult Halloween is in full effect.

12:43.773 --> 12:44.239
Hi. Oh!

12:44.307 --> 12:44.740
Hey.

12:44.807 --> 12:45.674
Surprise!

12:45.742 --> 12:46.808
What are you supposed to be?

12:46.876 --> 12:48.677
A big fat tubby frog.

12:48.745 --> 12:49.578
Oh.

12:49.646 --> 12:51.346
Is that a Brownie uniform?

12:51.414 --> 12:52.814
Like, a half of one.

12:52.934 --> 12:55.083
That unzips.

12:55.151 --> 12:56.351
You're not wearing a costume?

12:56.419 --> 12:58.153
Too scared. Why aren't you?

12:58.221 --> 12:59.855
Oh, I didn't know it was Halloween.

12:59.923 --> 13:00.555
Hey, guys.

13:00.623 --> 13:02.057
Hey!

13:02.125 --> 13:02.658
Hi.

13:02.725 --> 13:03.525
This is my friend Darcy.

13:03.593 --> 13:04.726
Hi, Darcy.

13:04.794 --> 13:05.360
I'm Kevin.

13:05.428 --> 13:06.762
Welcome to, uh, adult Halloween.

13:06.829 --> 13:07.396
Thank you.

13:07.463 --> 13:09.164
I love your costume.

13:09.232 --> 13:10.565
Yeah, sexy witch.

13:10.633 --> 13:11.333
Real witch.

13:11.401 --> 13:14.770
No, it's specific yet really
sexy and hot, showing some skin.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.604
It's not a costume.

13:15.672 --> 13:17.739
I just want to show some skin tonight.

13:17.807 --> 13:19.041
I'm Wiccan.

13:19.108 --> 13:19.641
Excuse me?

13:19.709 --> 13:20.742
I don't know what that means.

13:20.810 --> 13:23.612
I actually don't celebrate
your version of Halloween.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.647
In the Craft, we celebrate Samhain.

13:25.715 --> 13:27.149
It's a very spiritual night.

13:27.216 --> 13:27.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:28.051 --> 13:29.251
So you're a real witch?

13:29.319 --> 13:29.918
Yes.

13:29.986 --> 13:31.720
Do you know anything
about monkey curses?

13:31.788 --> 13:32.421
A bit, yeah.

13:32.488 --> 13:33.989
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:34.057 --> 13:34.556
Sure.

13:34.624 --> 13:35.290
Come this way.

13:35.358 --> 13:36.792
Can I get a drink, please, soldier?

13:36.859 --> 13:37.659
Absolutely.

13:37.727 --> 13:39.895
She knows a bit about monkey curses?

13:39.963 --> 13:41.430
We're not gonna talk
about this right now.

13:41.497 --> 13:41.930
A bit?

13:41.998 --> 13:42.631
You say when.

13:42.699 --> 13:43.472
Just keep...

13:43.947 --> 13:46.645
Didn't get the whole diploma
in the monkey curses, just did a

13:46.765 --> 13:48.236
minor; she minored in it.

13:48.304 --> 13:50.405
Tell me more about your monkey friend.

13:50.473 --> 13:54.609
Well, I called him "Potato" 'cause he
kind of smelled like French fries.

13:54.677 --> 13:55.677
Hey, guys.

13:55.745 --> 13:56.979
Oh, hey, Pete.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.780
What's going on over here, guys?

13:58.848 --> 14:00.015
We're conducting a seance.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.950
Oh, that's real weird.

14:02.018 --> 14:06.121
Taco, tell me how your monkey friend
crossed over into the spirit world.

14:06.189 --> 14:09.124
I took him from the petting zoo
and I knowingly brought him

14:09.192 --> 14:12.494
into the musical Armageddon
that is Andre's car.

14:12.562 --> 14:13.462
Don't put it on yourself.

14:13.529 --> 14:14.963
I really think it was
the Gin Blossoms.

14:15.031 --> 14:18.100
We'll resolve all this when we
speak with Potato directly.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.301
I'm sorry. Who's Potato?

14:19.369 --> 14:21.036
Potato is Taco's monkey friend.

14:21.104 --> 14:21.837
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.871
I should have known that.

14:22.939 --> 14:27.476
And as today is Samhain, it's the easiest
day to communicate with the dead.

14:27.543 --> 14:29.811
The membrane between the world
of the living and the world of

14:29.879 --> 14:31.947
the dead is at its
thinnest on Samhain.

14:32.015 --> 14:35.050
So thin you can see almost
all the way to Crazy Town.

14:35.118 --> 14:37.519
All right, I'm gonna go
hit the booze cart, guys.

14:37.587 --> 14:40.389
Tell ol' tater tot
I say, "Whassup?"

14:40.456 --> 14:41.690
I'm going.

14:41.758 --> 14:44.459
Okay, here we go.

Potato... Potat... Potato...
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.753
- Should we get high first?
- That's not necessary.

14:53.873 --> 14:55.033
But it's allowed, right?

14:55.153 --> 14:56.648
It's best to keep the mind clear.

14:56.768 --> 14:57.964
<i>It's the best way I know.</i>

15:01.577 --> 15:05.814

Pierre Thomas... I put him in!

15:07.750 --> 15:08.650
I should have taken him out.

15:08.718 --> 15:09.418
I put him in!

15:09.485 --> 15:11.086
I should have taken him out!

15:11.154 --> 15:12.921
I beat me. Pete beat me!

15:12.989 --> 15:14.356
Pete let me beat me!

15:14.424 --> 15:16.992
Goddamn you, Pete!

15:17.060 --> 15:19.861
Huh?

Pete and the monkey!

15:25.101 --> 15:26.835
I'll show you guys!

Damn you, Pete!

15:33.409 --> 15:37.212
Potato...

15:37.280 --> 15:38.980
I see him! I see Potato.

15:39.048 --> 15:39.981
He's very restless.

15:40.049 --> 15:41.183

15:41.250 --> 15:41.850
No.

Five For Fighting?

15:46.322 --> 15:47.055
Boyz II Men?

15:47.123 --> 15:48.857
Please tell me it's not Boyz II Men.

15:48.925 --> 15:49.991
He's covering his ears.

15:50.059 --> 15:51.526
Is it Creed? Nickelback?

15:51.594 --> 15:55.397
He wants to know if you have
anything to say to him.

15:55.465 --> 15:56.398
I do.

15:56.466 --> 15:57.833
Say it now.

Are you okay?

20:20.208 --> 20:21.775
Yeah.

20:21.843 --> 20:22.976
What happened to your pants?

20:23.044 --> 20:24.644
The monkey took off with them.

20:24.712 --> 20:26.613
What's he doing with them?

20:26.681 --> 20:27.948
Still?

You look super sexy.

20:34.288 --> 20:35.155
Oh?

20:35.223 --> 20:37.224

that monkey started.
