07:38.875 --> 07:41.669
in here, okay

07:41.711 --> 07:43.297
'cause Vicky's coming over.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.132
- Ooh!

07:45.173 --> 07:47.717
There is nothing

07:45.173 --> 07:47.717
to "ooh!" about.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.428
Oh, yes, there is.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.431
You kissed her.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.433
Dad, don't be so

07:52.472 --> 07:54.433
embarrassed.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.892
You two make a cute couple.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.560
Go for it.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.355
Look, it was one little

07:57.602 --> 08:00.355
goodnight kiss.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.607
We haven't even

08:00.397 --> 08:02.607
talked about it since.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.025
What?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.652
You've worked with her

08:04.067 --> 08:05.652
every day for a week

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
and you haven't even

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
brought it up?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.739
Why are you such a chicken?

08:09.781 --> 08:10.907
I am not a chicken.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.533
This is a very

08:10.949 --> 08:12.533
delicate situation

08:12.575 --> 08:14.202
and I'm just proceeding

08:12.575 --> 08:14.202
cautiously because--

08:14.244 --> 08:15.787
[clucking]

08:17.998 --> 08:20.959
Would you girls please

08:17.998 --> 08:20.959
give me a break?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.170
Maybe she doesn't

08:21.001 --> 08:23.170
even remember the kiss.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.421
Maybe she hated it.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.922
Well, think positive.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.425
Maybe she doesn't

08:25.964 --> 08:28.425
remember she hated it.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.968
[doorbell rings]

08:30.010 --> 08:31.052
That's Vicky.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.553
- Ooh!

08:32.595 --> 08:34.514
There's nothing between us.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.814
- Hi, Danny.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.814
- Hi.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.316
- Hi, girls.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.316
- Hi, Vicky.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.859
We were just talking

08:44.358 --> 08:45.859
about you.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.402
No, no, we weren't.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.070
Well, yeah, we were

08:47.444 --> 08:49.070
just talking about the fact

08:49.112 --> 08:50.822
that you were just

08:49.112 --> 08:50.822
outside the door.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.492
But now that you're inside..

08:53.533 --> 08:55.285
...our talk is pretty much over.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.662
Well, thanks for

08:55.327 --> 08:57.662
catching me up.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.247
Well, Steph,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.247
let's go to the store.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.540
Do you guys need anything?

09:00.581 --> 09:02.667
Milk? Juice? Chapstick?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.086
Thanks, we'll be fine.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.672
You can take your time

09:05.128 --> 09:07.672
at the store.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.884
Are you sure you don't need

09:07.714 --> 09:10.884
anymore Binaca, dad?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.469
Bye, girls.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.472
Aren't they precious?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.266
Danny, you seem a little

09:15.514 --> 09:18.266
nervous, is anything wrong?

09:18.308 --> 09:23.021
No! No, no, no.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.272
Well, great.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.857
Then should we get to work?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.110
Yes, yes, yes.

09:29.152 --> 09:33.407
Uh, I-I made a list of possible

09:29.152 --> 09:33.407
guests for next week.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.451
Uh, Joe Montana,

09:33.448 --> 09:36.451
Henry Kisser, Sean Penn--

09:36.493 --> 09:37.785
Uh..

09:37.827 --> 09:39.204
Kisser?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.122
Excuse me?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.208
You just said

09:41.164 --> 09:43.208
"Henry Kisser."

09:43.250 --> 09:44.959
Ah, no. I said Henry<i> Kissinger.</i>

09:45.001 --> 09:47.712
It's written write there.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.712
Why would I say Henry Kisser?

09:47.754 --> 09:50.382
Oh, that-that's right.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.382
Why would you say that?

09:50.424 --> 09:51.925
It's not on your lips.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.302
Your list, your list.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.805
Vicky, why are

09:55.470 --> 09:57.805
we doing this?

09:57.847 --> 10:00.183
We both know that

09:57.847 --> 10:00.183
we kissed last week.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.768
You're right..

10:01.809 --> 10:04.396
And now that it's

10:01.809 --> 10:04.396
out in the open

10:04.438 --> 10:07.941
I-I think the best

10:04.438 --> 10:07.941
thing to do is..

10:10.318 --> 10:12.446
To forget it ever happened.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.530
Right.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.241
It-it-it's forgotten..

10:16.283 --> 10:17.909
What-whatever it was.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.036
I mean, not that it

10:17.951 --> 10:20.036
wasn't, uh, a nice kiss.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.829
I liked it.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.582
Really?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.751
I liked it, too.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.002
A lot.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.755
But..

10:30.797 --> 10:33.550
That doesn't matter now,

10:30.797 --> 10:33.550
because, uh..

10:33.592 --> 10:35.802
- It never happened.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.178
So, uh..

10:40.348 --> 10:42.350
Alright, Michelle,

10:40.348 --> 10:42.350
you got your helmet.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.185
You got your goggles,

10:42.392 --> 10:44.185
you got your elbow pads

10:44.227 --> 10:46.313
you got your knee pads,

10:44.227 --> 10:46.313
you got your shin pads.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.855
You ready to ride?

10:47.897 --> 10:50.066
I don't know

10:47.897 --> 10:50.066
if I can move.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.485
Well, better safe

10:50.108 --> 10:51.485
than sorry.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.111
You don't

10:51.526 --> 10:53.111
want to get hurt.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.030
Hurt? Why did you say that word?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.657
Oh, I'm sure

10:56.072 --> 10:57.657
you won't get hurt.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.326
But, this way at least

10:57.698 --> 10:59.326
you'll be protected

10:59.367 --> 11:01.077
in case you fall off.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.997
Fall off?

11:01.119 --> 11:03.997
More bad words!

11:04.038 --> 11:05.290
Okay, time out.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.292
Now, forget about

11:05.332 --> 11:07.292
all those bad words.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.793
There's really nothing to it.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.631
Now, watch carefully

11:08.835 --> 11:12.631
as I get on the bike.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.132
Push off.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.467
And pedal!

11:15.509 --> 11:17.552
See? Woo!

11:15.509 --> 11:17.552
Nothing to it!

11:17.594 --> 11:19.846
No hands! Ha ha!

11:19.887 --> 11:21.931
- Hello.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.931
- Oh, hello!

11:21.973 --> 11:23.475
Uh, this isn't my bike.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.186
That's not my kid.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.186
I'm available!

11:26.227 --> 11:29.981
Probably not into big guys

11:26.227 --> 11:29.981
with small bikes.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.899
Okay, now..

11:31.941 --> 11:33.610
...It's your turn, Michelle.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.695
Just hop on, push off,

11:33.652 --> 11:36.695
and start pedaling.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.239
And I'll hold onto the back.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.783
- That's it?

11:38.281 --> 11:40.783
- Oh, piece of cake.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.203
Alright, get on the bike.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.246
I'll hold onto the back.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.166
And trust me

11:45.288 --> 11:48.166
There's nothing to worry about.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.292
Okay?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.794
On your mark, get set..

11:51.836 --> 11:54.088
...start pedaling.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.798
Attagirl.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.842
Alright!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.842
Looking good!

11:57.884 --> 12:00.303
This is easy!

12:00.345 --> 12:02.847
Attagirl, you're doing it

12:00.345 --> 12:02.847
all by yourself!

12:02.889 --> 12:05.684
I am? Holy cow!

12:06.309 --> 12:08.311
Whoa!

12:10.771 --> 12:12.482
Michelle, are you okay?

12:12.524 --> 12:15.193
'I'm so sorry.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.193
Are you hurt?'

12:15.235 --> 12:16.777
You let go of me!

12:16.819 --> 12:19.489
I only let go because

12:16.819 --> 12:19.489
you were doing so well.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.576
Then why am I in this bush?

12:22.617 --> 12:25.786
Okay, let's get you

12:22.617 --> 12:25.786
out of there, kiddo.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.539
I think you're going to be okay.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.001
No, I'm not.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.001
I got a scrape.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.670
Ouch!

12:33.712 --> 12:35.129
Well, it's not a bad scrape.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.673
You're gonna be just fine.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.008
Now, let's get back

12:36.715 --> 12:39.008
on the bike and try again.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.719
What am I, nuts?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.138
This time I promise

12:41.844 --> 12:44.138
I won't let go.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.517
I'll never trust you again!

12:47.559 --> 12:49.352
Michelle.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.271
Michelle!

12:51.312 --> 12:53.273
Aw, come on, sweetheart.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.743
Michelle, I'm sorry

13:01.740 --> 13:04.743
you fell off your bike.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.954
Okay, if you

13:05.952 --> 13:07.954
won't talk to Joey.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.039
[imitating Bullwinkle]

13:07.995 --> 13:10.039
Will you talk to

13:07.995 --> 13:10.039
your old pal Bullwinkle?

13:10.081 --> 13:13.543
Okay, tell Joey

13:10.081 --> 13:13.543
I'm very mad at him.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.796
Joey, Michelle

13:14.961 --> 13:17.796
is very mad at you.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.467
Maybe you can tell her

13:17.838 --> 13:20.467
that it was just an accident

13:20.508 --> 13:21.884
and I love her like crazy.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.470
Maybe she won't

13:21.926 --> 13:23.470
believe you.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.554
She will.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.554
She won't.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.639
She will.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.639
She won't.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.848
She will.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.848
She won't.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.142
Oh, I saw a smile.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.769
- Oops.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.769
- No, too late.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.228
I already saw you smiling.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.522
Only because you're funny.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.775
Well, that's a start.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.485
Can I fix that

13:36.815 --> 13:38.485
scrape for you?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.445
Can Bullwinkle do it?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.363
Why, certainly.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.492
Dr. Bullwinkle T. Moose

13:42.405 --> 13:45.492
at your service.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.494
Just have a seat in my office.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.663
Okay, here we go.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.372
Sit tight for a moment.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.083
Now, this may sting a little.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.462
Ouch! That stings a lot!

13:57.504 --> 13:58.921
I'm sorry.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.049
You lied again. Now I

13:58.963 --> 14:02.049
really don't trust you.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.926
It wasn't me.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.926
It was, uh..

14:03.968 --> 14:05.886
It was Bullwinkle.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.473
Oh, sure.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.473
Blamin' on the moose.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.022
Okay, you're fed, changed,

14:12.893 --> 14:16.022
dressed and still napping

14:16.063 --> 14:20.067
and one hour later, we're ready

14:16.063 --> 14:20.067
to be totally spontaneous.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.487
Not so fast.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.487
We got to put on our CTHS.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.946
Our Car Trip Hats.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.036
Jesse, Aunt Ida hates it when

14:26.199 --> 14:30.036
you wear your hat backwards.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.746
I know.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.831
Boys?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.290
Get ready to bug your Aunt Ida.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.585
Here you go.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.964
There you go.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.509
Alright!

14:44.551 --> 14:47.387
There, now we're

14:44.551 --> 14:47.387
ready to ride like the wind.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.639
Wait a minute.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.639
We need extra diapers.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.307
Right, alright,

14:49.681 --> 14:51.307
you guys rest up.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.600
Because when you meet Aunt Ida.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.435
You won't sleep for days.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.105
Jesse Katsopolis!

14:58.147 --> 14:59.566
Here, let's grab this bag.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.651
- Okay.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.651
- Alright.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.486
I've got the diapers.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.321
Oh, baby wipes.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.656
Baby wipes, very good.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.948
Well, you know what

15:06.698 --> 15:07.948
Nicky's got a little rash.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.033
We need that baby butt stuff

15:09.075 --> 15:11.619
the, uh...here it is.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.497
Okay, one more diaper

15:11.661 --> 15:14.497
and we are set.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.583
Oh, wait a minute,

15:14.539 --> 15:16.583
Just to be safe

15:16.624 --> 15:18.793
we better take everything

15:16.624 --> 15:18.793
on the changing table.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.714
Good thinking.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.173
Alright, there we are.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.301
Spontaneously packed and ready

15:24.215 --> 15:27.301
to ride like the wind.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.847
Oh, wait a minute!

15:27.343 --> 15:30.847
Jess, it could get windy.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.140
We better bring

15:30.889 --> 15:33.140
blankets and scarves.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.601
Good thinking.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.935
Oh, wait a minute,

15:34.642 --> 15:35.935
wait a minute, What if it rains?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.061
We're gonna have to get

15:35.976 --> 15:37.061
their slickers

15:37.103 --> 15:38.688
and their galoshie-booties

15:37.103 --> 15:38.688
alright.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.232
Wait a minute.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.443
It could get really hot.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.111
Sun suits.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.404
You know what, we don't know

15:45.152 --> 15:46.404
what's going to happen

15:46.446 --> 15:49.741
out there, I say we take

15:46.446 --> 15:49.741
the whole dresser.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.076
Honey, I just

15:49.783 --> 15:52.076
had a thought.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.954
I mean, this is the first time

15:52.118 --> 15:54.954
the boys will be away from home.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.749
Maybe, we should bring something

15:54.995 --> 15:57.749
familiar and comforting.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.085
Right, their Elvis mobiles.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.211
You know..

16:03.963 --> 16:05.381
...I've been looking

16:03.963 --> 16:05.381
for an excuse

16:05.423 --> 16:07.007
to hang these on the rear-view

16:05.423 --> 16:07.007
mirror, anyway.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.511
Ah, Jess, honey,

16:09.343 --> 16:10.511
do you think they might

16:10.553 --> 16:12.054
miss their stuffed animals.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.264
Of course they'll miss

16:12.096 --> 16:13.264
their stuffed animals

16:13.306 --> 16:15.266
We gotta take them,

16:13.306 --> 16:15.266
here there you go.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.143
Ready?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.143
And catch.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.228
- Got it.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.228
- And catch.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.230
- Got it.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.230
- And catch.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.527
Okay, we've, we've gone over

16:24.442 --> 16:26.527
all the days of the week.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.655
Monday, Tuesday, uh..

16:28.696 --> 16:30.657
All those other days.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.453
I'm sorry, Danny.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.453
What did you say?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.955
I have no idea.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.333
I-I can't think about

16:36.996 --> 16:40.333
anything but that kiss.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.710
Me, too.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.045
This is crazy.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.045
We work together.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.423
Yeah, you're right.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.423
We cannot start a relationship.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.216
Yeah and who knows

16:47.465 --> 16:49.216
where I'll be

16:49.258 --> 16:52.303
after Becky comes back

16:49.258 --> 16:52.303
to "Wake Up, San Francisco?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.054
Let's just forget about it.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.265
It's forgotten.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.858
Whoa! Make out,

17:01.771 --> 17:04.858
San Francisco!

17:05.984 --> 17:07.735
Steph, go to your room.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.823
I mean, hi! You learn

17:07.777 --> 17:11.823
to ride that bike yet?

17:11.865 --> 17:13.825
That's Michelle.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.453
Nice shade of lipstick, dad.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.998
Don't you girls have somebody

17:17.495 --> 17:19.998
else you can go embarrass?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.750
Sorry, dad, you two have fun

17:20.039 --> 17:22.750
playing tonsil hockey.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.634
Have I, uh, mentioned

17:28.381 --> 17:31.634
to you how precious they are?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.640
Vicky, why are we

17:34.220 --> 17:37.640
doing this to ourselves?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.226
I don't know.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.062
Maybe we should go with it.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.398
You know what?

17:43.103 --> 17:45.398
You're right.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.816
Let's be crazy.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.442
Let's be totally outrageous.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.194
Vicky, come with me.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.529
Let's fly to Paris tonight.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.990
Oh, Danny, Danny we have

17:51.571 --> 17:53.990
a show to do tomorrow.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.784
How about frozen yogurt?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.912
You wild man!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.415
- Vanilla.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.415
- You're insane!

18:02.456 --> 18:04.124
Ah, with sprinkles.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.754
Get the door.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.883
Okay, just follow

18:09.296 --> 18:11.883
the sound of my voice, Jess.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.927
Come on. Straight ahead.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.927
There you go.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.265
Alright.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.265
Here we go.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.976
Now we're ready to..

18:22.018 --> 18:23.770
...ride like the wind.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.940
Do you think

18:25.229 --> 18:26.940
we really need all this stuff?

18:26.981 --> 18:29.734
I mean, we're only be gone

18:26.981 --> 18:29.734
two or three hours.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.071
That's what Gilligan said.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.489
Oh, yeah, good point.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.657
We wouldn't wanna get

18:35.531 --> 18:36.657
shipwrecked

18:36.699 --> 18:38.158
without our Elvis mobiles.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.203
Now, Beck, It took us

18:39.452 --> 18:41.203
two hours to get ready.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.581
It'll be very spontaneous

18:41.245 --> 18:43.581
to go to the Harley shop

18:43.623 --> 18:45.041
and Aunt Ida's. Let's go.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.542
Jess, let's face it.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.669
Life as we knew it is no more.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.798
Next time we want

18:50.046 --> 18:51.798
to be spontaneous..

18:51.839 --> 18:53.507
...let's plan ahead.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.508
[doorbell rings]

18:54.550 --> 18:55.551
Honey, could you get that?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.971
- Ha, ha, ha

18:55.593 --> 18:57.971
- Ha! Kidding.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.060
Aunt Ida!

19:04.102 --> 19:06.312
We were just

19:04.102 --> 19:06.312
coming to see you!

19:06.353 --> 19:07.981
Becky, that's not funny.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.984
Hi, Jesse.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.738
Hi, Aunt Ida.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.240
Beautiful new 'do.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.909
I was in the neighborhood.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.411
Turn your hat around.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.411
You look like a hoodlum.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.876
[babbling]

19:34.548 --> 19:35.800
- Hi, Michelle.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.638
Want to buy a bike?

19:37.802 --> 19:40.638
It's only 50 cents.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.015
No, thanks.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.017
Hey, Joey told us

19:42.056 --> 19:44.017
you fell off your bike.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.476
So, why don't we give it

19:44.058 --> 19:45.476
one last shot

19:45.518 --> 19:46.727
of you sitting on the bike

19:46.769 --> 19:48.521
that you're never

19:46.769 --> 19:48.521
gonna ride again.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.523
Is this a trick?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.985
Michelle,

19:51.357 --> 19:53.985
bubbie, baby.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.987
If we wanted to trick you

19:54.027 --> 19:55.987
we'd think of something

19:56.029 --> 19:59.281
a little more clever than asking

19:56.029 --> 19:59.281
you to sit on your bike.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.575
Now, sit on your bike.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.994
Here, I'll hold you.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.290
Steph, how does she look?

20:08.332 --> 20:12.252
I think the light would be

20:08.332 --> 20:12.252
better way over there.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.672
Steph, you are so right.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.966
Now, Michelle,

20:14.714 --> 20:16.966
I'll hold you steady.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.301
You just start pedaling.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.596
Stop the bike.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.596
I want to get off.

20:22.638 --> 20:26.100
Alright. Hop off.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.022
This was a trick.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.022
Shame on you!

20:31.064 --> 20:32.732
We're sorry, Michelle.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.901
We just thought you should

20:32.773 --> 20:34.901
give your bike another chance.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.154
Maybe you didn't

20:34.942 --> 20:38.154
see this scrape.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.322
Girls, can I talk

20:38.196 --> 20:40.322
to Michelle for a minute?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.408
- Sure.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.408
- Good luck.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.163
Michelle, it's obvious

20:44.869 --> 20:47.163
you're way too smart

20:47.205 --> 20:48.998
to fall for a trick.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.875
It's very obvious.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.919
Would you go for a bribe?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.964
Never!

20:54.045 --> 20:56.964
What do you got?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.926
Well, if you

20:57.006 --> 20:59.926
give me a chance

20:59.967 --> 21:01.635
to teach you how to ride.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.931
You can have your

21:01.677 --> 21:04.931
very own copy of

21:04.972 --> 21:06.432
"The Little Mermaid".

21:06.473 --> 21:07.892
No, thank you.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.643
It's your favorite movie.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.312
It's on cable all month.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.733
Look, Michelle.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.526
I'm sorry that

21:15.775 --> 21:17.526
you had an accident

21:17.568 --> 21:19.319
but I had to let go.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.114
That's how you learn.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.157
Otherwise every kid

21:21.155 --> 21:23.157
you see riding a bike

21:23.199 --> 21:25.743
would have a grownup

21:23.199 --> 21:25.743
hanging on the back.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.496
That's better than

21:25.785 --> 21:29.496
falling in a bush.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.165
I'm gonna tell you something

21:29.538 --> 21:31.165
that I should've told you

21:31.207 --> 21:32.917
before we ever started.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.961
You don't know

21:32.959 --> 21:34.961
what you're doing?

21:36.336 --> 21:40.507
No, that learning to ride

21:36.336 --> 21:40.507
a bike is hard work.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.552
No matter how many times you

21:40.549 --> 21:43.552
fall you have to keep trying

21:43.594 --> 21:46.388
because once you get it right

21:43.594 --> 21:46.388
it's really worth it.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.141
Are you sure about this?

21:48.182 --> 21:51.727
Hey, come on. You and I

21:48.182 --> 21:51.727
are buds. We go way back.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.148
Until you wiped out,

21:51.769 --> 21:55.148
did I ever let you down?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.024
No.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.986
Well than, how about giving your

21:57.066 --> 21:59.986
old pal Joey one more chance?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.279
Okay, old pal.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.780
Attagirl.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.284
Kiss.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.662
You're not gonna

22:07.493 --> 22:09.662
let me go, right?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.372
No way, not until

22:09.703 --> 22:12.372
you say so.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.293
Okay, let's do it!

22:15.334 --> 22:17.920
Alright.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.920
You're doing it, Michelle.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.714
- Let go!

22:17.962 --> 22:20.714
- Are you sure?

22:20.756 --> 22:21.799
Let go!

22:21.841 --> 22:23.843
Are you really,

22:21.841 --> 22:23.843
really sure?

22:23.884 --> 22:26.762
I said let go!

22:28.472 --> 22:30.266
(Joey)

22:28.472 --> 22:30.266
'Way to go!'

22:30.308 --> 22:32.643
I'm not in the bush!

22:32.685 --> 22:36.272
Michelle, I'm so proud of you.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.272
You did it all by yourself!

22:36.314 --> 22:39.441
Uh-uh, Joey.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.441
I did it with you.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.027
Wanna go for
