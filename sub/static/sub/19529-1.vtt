<i>Oh, yes, that's funny.</i>

00:26.460 --> 00:29.161
<i>Oh, that was so funny.
I like that one.</i>

00:29.163 --> 00:31.296
Henry. Henry Phillips.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.032
Hey, John, man, I'm a huge fan.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.500
Oh, thanks.
These are my friends.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.035
We're all gonna see
your show tonight.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.669
Hey, how's it going?
Thanks for coming.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.271
We drove all the way from
Greensboro to see you.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.173
Oh, wow.
We reserved the table.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.175
I called ahead. We got
a table front row and center.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.576
I was like, "we wanna
be right up front"

00:44.578 --> 00:46.211
to see Henry Phillips.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.047
That's really cool.
Thanks, thanks so much.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.749
Please tell me you're
gonna sing the bitch song.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.352
Uh, you know what, that one
hasn't really grown on me.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.820
So, I don't think
I'm gonna play it tonight.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.321
Come on, man.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.191
<i>Oh shit.</i>

00:59.193 --> 01:01.427
Are you okay, man?
Oh, shit.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.295
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:03.297 --> 01:05.197
<i>Oh, my god, you're bleeding.</i>

01:05.199 --> 01:06.732
What the hell.
We have to go to the hospital.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.600
God.
Oh, my god.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.136
- Oh, no.
<i>- Tilt your head back.</i>

01:11.138 --> 01:12.838
<i>Yeah. It's like
your nose is broken.</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:15.240
Are you okay?
Are you guys... are you...

01:15.242 --> 01:17.643
<i>So, we're going to the
fucking hospital?</i>

01:17.645 --> 01:19.311
I hope it gets better, man.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.379
We drove all the way
from Greensboro.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.614
<i>I'm sorry, Henry.</i>

01:43.303 --> 01:45.404
<i>This is Sharon Levine
and you're listening</i>

01:45.406 --> 01:49.208
<i>to mouth fuck and I'm here
with comedian Henry Phillips.</i>

01:49.210 --> 01:51.743
<i>You call yourself a rambling
troubadour extraordinaire.</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:53.445
What's that?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.714
Uh, yeah, that's...
My manager says that.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.683
I don't even know
what that means exactly.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.619
<i>I mean I'm a troubadour
and that... I guess</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:02.421
I play music and I travel,

02:02.423 --> 02:03.822
so that's the rambling part.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.757
I don't know
about extraordinaire.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.559
Extraordinaire, that seems
like it might be subjective.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.294
- Yeah.
<i>- It's like calling</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:11.296
<i>yourself the king of pop
or something.</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:13.165
<i>Well, for a while there
I was calling myself</i>

02:13.167 --> 02:15.367
<i>the king of hit-and-miss
comedy folk music</i>

02:15.369 --> 02:17.269
<i>at shitty one-night bar gigs,</i>

02:17.271 --> 02:20.139
<i>but apparently I'm not
the first to own that one.</i>

02:20.141 --> 02:21.373
<i>You got to Google that stuff</i>

02:21.375 --> 02:23.142
<i>to make sure it's not taken.</i>

02:23.144 --> 02:25.177
<i>- That's true.
- My trick.</i>

02:25.179 --> 02:26.745
Gonna do a song for you now,

02:26.747 --> 02:30.182
um, that I wanna dedicate
to anybody out there

02:30.184 --> 02:33.619
in this room,
and I hope you enjoy it.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.560
Sorry.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.168
Shit.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.577
Ma'am, you can't use
your phone in here.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.302
All right, everybody,
I actually happen to have

03:57.304 --> 03:58.837
one of these pills
on me right now.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.472
We're gonna take this
and see if it works.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.507
I've never
tried this before, but...

04:04.545 --> 04:07.679
Chug, chug, chug, chug...

04:10.383 --> 04:12.517
Thank you...

04:12.519 --> 04:15.354
For supporting what's clearly
a problem that I have.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.630
Ow!

04:28.501 --> 04:30.569
Thank you. I wanna say
I sell these pills

04:30.571 --> 04:33.672
for $10 a piece after the show if
you guys wanna come up and, uh...

04:33.674 --> 04:37.576
<i>How do you describe what you do?</i>

04:37.578 --> 04:41.046
Well, I've always like to say
that what I take from my life

04:41.048 --> 04:43.682
I give back through my art.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.552
<i>And so far, I've taken
nothing but shit.</i>

04:50.657 --> 04:52.824
Thanks, everybody.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.365
- Ellen?
<i>- Henry?</i>

05:00.367 --> 05:01.533
Hey.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.302
It's so good to hear your voice.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.703
Same here. How are you?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.538
<i>- I'm great.
- Hey.</i>

05:06.540 --> 05:07.939
Okay. Hey, how are you doing?
Are you on the phone?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.675
I am. I'm sorry Ellen.
Hold on one second.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.009
<i>Okay.</i>
Listen. I thought you were

05:11.011 --> 05:12.911
really, really, really funny.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.646
Thanks for coming to the show.
I was laughing and stuff.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.481
I've had four beers
and, um, eight shots.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.582
No but listen,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.051
you just got to keep trying.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.986
<i>- Henry, are you...
- Hey, man.</i>

05:20.988 --> 05:22.754
What's up, man?
Guess what, guess what.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.089
What's that?
My name is Phil.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.024
Oh, awesome.
My name is Henry Phillips.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.759
Same difference, who cares.
Dude, come have some beer.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.927
No, no, no, I got to...
Dude, come on.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.595
My friends are super funny.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.364
They should be comedians.
I know. Man, i...

05:32.366 --> 05:33.732
Dude, come on,
we're going to the city bars.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.334
It's gonna be fun.
Come on, dude.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.601
No, I got a gig.
Don't be a pussy, bro.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.903
Next week.
You're so weak bro.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.004
No, I suck.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.706
Hey, I'm out now. Sorry.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.574
I can hear you. What's up?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.775
<i>Well, let me just cut
to the chase.</i>

05:43.777 --> 05:45.410
Do you know who Jay Warren is?

05:45.412 --> 05:46.978
<i>Jay Warren, the director?</i>

05:46.980 --> 05:48.413
<i>Well, he's not just a director.</i>

05:48.415 --> 05:49.815
<i>A producer, major producer.</i>

05:49.817 --> 05:51.383
He wants to meet with you.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.617
He wants to meet with me?

05:52.619 --> 05:53.985
<i>Yes.</i>
Why?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.387
He heard what happened to you

05:55.389 --> 05:57.622
out here five years ago and,

05:57.624 --> 06:00.892
well, he's fascinated
and he wants to see your act.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.495
Let me guess, this means
that I have to go out to la?

06:03.497 --> 06:04.763
<i>I know you have a bad
taste in your mouth</i>

06:04.765 --> 06:06.732
<i>about last time</i>

06:06.734 --> 06:08.834
but if nothing else you get
to meet a big time producer.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.570
<i>I mean, are things really
going that great out there?</i>

06:11.572 --> 06:13.038
Yeah. No, I mean,
things are going good.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.941
I've got, you know,
people coming out.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.110
I had a whole bunch of people
coming out from Greensboro

06:18.112 --> 06:19.711
just to see me so.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.746
<i>If you need a place to stay,</i>

06:20.748 --> 06:22.481
you could stay with me.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.082
No, we don't... we wouldn't
have to do that.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.917
I have this friend Jillian
who just moved out there

06:25.919 --> 06:27.619
and she's been pressuring me
to go out and visit.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.654
So, I could stay with her.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.457
<i>Mouth fuck is brought
to you by read to me.</i>

06:32.459 --> 06:34.426
Read to me is our sponsor,

06:34.428 --> 06:37.129
and we love them,
and they will read to you

06:37.131 --> 06:39.698
<i>if you can't read,
or you don't feel like reading,</i>

06:39.700 --> 06:41.600
<i>or you're too lazy
or too stupid.</i>

06:41.602 --> 06:42.801
Listen to a book

06:42.803 --> 06:45.871
in your earholes, read to me.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.506
- Sorry.
<i>- Oh, that's all right.</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.474
I know you got to pay the bills.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.476
<i>So, how does the misconception</i>

06:51.478 --> 06:55.614
about being racist, uh, occur?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.483
It had to do with...

06:58.485 --> 07:00.619
Being racist?
Yeah.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.554
<i>No, I think
that people wanted me</i>

07:02.556 --> 07:04.156
to be racist because it's sold,

07:04.158 --> 07:05.891
<i>you know, advertising.</i>

07:05.893 --> 07:07.826
<i>See, I came out to la
a few years ago</i>

07:07.828 --> 07:09.127
<i>and it started out pretty good.</i>

07:09.129 --> 07:10.829
<i>I even got a record deal.</i>

07:10.831 --> 07:12.531
<i>But one day I was at a meeting,</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:14.433
<i>and I asked this guy
at the label</i>

07:14.435 --> 07:16.168
<i>where they got their bagels,
and the truth is</i>

07:16.170 --> 07:18.103
<i>I didn't give a shit
where they got the bagels.</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:21.039
<i>I was just trying to make
small talk but, anyway,</i>

07:21.041 --> 07:22.841
<i>the guy started yelling
at people,</i>

07:22.843 --> 07:24.810
<i>you know, power tripping.
Saying like,</i>

07:24.812 --> 07:26.578
<i>"Henry Phillips needs
to know where the fucking</i>

07:26.580 --> 07:28.146
<i>bagels are from," or whatever</i>

07:28.148 --> 07:30.649
<i>and it made me look like
an asshole.</i>

07:30.651 --> 07:32.651
<i>Anyway, eventually there
was an article in the paper</i>

07:32.653 --> 07:35.187
<i>saying that I was a Neo-Nazi
or something.</i>

07:35.189 --> 07:37.522
<i>Uh, you know, there was a lot
of stuff that happened</i>

07:37.524 --> 07:39.458
<i>in between there but either way,</i>

07:39.460 --> 07:42.227
<i>it ended up with me
getting wound out of town</i>

07:42.229 --> 07:44.696
<i>but I'm back now to try it again</i>

07:44.698 --> 07:46.138
<i>and I'm just hoping
it goes better.</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:50.836
- Oh, my gosh.
<i>- Hey.</i>

07:50.838 --> 07:52.604
You look the exact same.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.206
Thanks, you too.
Yeah.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.941
Oh, it's so good to see you.
It's so good to see you.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.075
Come on in.
Yeah.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.010
This is Zoe.
Hi.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.111
Zoe, this is Henry.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.079
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.848
Yeah, finally.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.850
I'm so glad you're here.
It's so good to see you.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.518
It's funny I feel,
like I just...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.621
No.
Oh.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.189
<i>- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, no, it's fine.</i>

08:11.191 --> 08:12.724
<i>Um, was that expensive?</i>

08:12.726 --> 08:14.693
Yeah, it's a glass tomato.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.695
Of course, it is.
I can take your guitar for you.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.230
Sorry, I have this new case,
it's bigger.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.532
Be careful. Yeah.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.601
All right.
Why don't you take a load off.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.203
Go sit down and maybe take
Henry out to the patio...

08:25.205 --> 08:26.605
Yeah. I'll show you the patio.
Okay.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.173
<i>Oh, that sounds amazing.</i>

08:28.175 --> 08:31.209
Again, I'm sorry about
that whatever that was.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.544
Well, fost-adopt allows
for you to foster a child

08:33.547 --> 08:36.648
or even a baby and then after
certain amount of time,

08:36.650 --> 08:38.917
the judge decides if you
can keep a child or not.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.053
Oh, wow. So, you could
actually have a child,

08:42.054 --> 08:43.755
and become attached
to the child,

08:43.756 --> 08:45.257
and then the judge
can just take it away

08:45.259 --> 08:46.725
from you like that?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.260
Yeah. They try
to reunite the kids

08:48.262 --> 08:49.961
with the biological parents

08:49.963 --> 08:51.162
as much as possible.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.565
But what happens then?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.067
I mean, that would
just be so painful

08:56.069 --> 08:58.937
and then we'd have to
start completely over.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.840
Boy, that would be really sad.

09:01.842 --> 09:05.076
You seem like
a pretty upbeat guy.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.145
Yeah... oh, you're joking.
I'm sorry.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.847
I'm gonna perk up, I promise.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.082
I've just been
on a long road trip here.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.585
I was just telling him
about our adoption plans.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.320
Oh, yeah, dude, sorry,

09:15.322 --> 09:17.088
I should have warned
you that's pretty much

09:17.090 --> 09:19.291
all we talk about
around here these days.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.059
That's okay.
It sounds really promising

09:21.061 --> 09:22.327
and exciting.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.230
Yeah, it is exciting
and promising.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.333
Um, but it also
can be very grueling

09:28.335 --> 09:32.103
and at times, painful.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.239
That's awesome.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.242
It can be awesome at times.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.777
<i>Are you okay?</i>

09:38.779 --> 09:40.679
Well, I'm pretty sure

09:40.681 --> 09:42.113
<i>that's where I parked my car.</i>

09:42.115 --> 09:43.214
Is it not there anymore?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.950
No, it's gone.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.885
I parked it right
in front of that house.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.187
Oh, man.
Did you lock it?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.222
I mean, I should
have locked it, right?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.791
You didn't lock it.

09:52.793 --> 09:57.329
Suzuki Forenza 2006 and silver.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.331
<i>I ran your vin number
through the system</i>

09:59.333 --> 10:00.966
<i>and nothing came up
and so I'm gonna</i>

10:00.968 --> 10:02.667
<i>the designated vehicle
as stolen.</i>

10:02.669 --> 10:04.869
Well, that sucks.
So, what happens now?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.172
Well, I mean, I can't make
any promises

10:07.174 --> 10:09.874
but often times whoever
extracted the vehicle

10:09.876 --> 10:11.910
just wanted to take it
on a joyride

10:11.912 --> 10:14.846
<i>and most likely
a group of juveniles.</i>

10:14.848 --> 10:16.881
<i>It is possible that
the vehicle will reemerge</i>

10:16.883 --> 10:18.750
<i>somewhere in the neighborhood</i>

10:18.752 --> 10:20.919
<i>and you will be notified
when it's located.</i>

10:20.921 --> 10:22.954
Well, that would be great.
Is that normally what happens?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.789
I mean, it's the best
case scenario.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.659
I can't attest to what would
be designated as normal

10:27.661 --> 10:29.761
in this particularly situation.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.063
Well, I guess I meant
in your personal experience.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.399
<i>My personal experience,</i>

10:34.401 --> 10:36.768
if I tell you something then
you're gonna hold me to it

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
and so, I'd prefer not
to get into any predictions

10:38.739 --> 10:41.072
or conjecture, okay?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.807
Okay. Thanks.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.078
That guy is a dick.
What did they say?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.881
Well, he said he ran
the, uh, registration number

10:49.883 --> 10:52.083
into the system
or something and, uh,

10:52.085 --> 10:54.085
he said it's definitely stolen.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.820
Oh, my god.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.789
The good news is he seems
to think it's just some

10:57.791 --> 10:59.691
teenagers out on a joyride.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.126
Okay. I don't know
what joy

11:01.128 --> 11:03.061
there would be in
driving your shit

11:03.063 --> 11:04.763
basket car around town.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.265
Well... shit,
I guess, I got to,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
if it's okay,
get a ride to the place

11:09.369 --> 11:10.835
tonight on sunset boulevard.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.270
<i>Is that...</i>
Yeah, of course.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.072
Yeah. I mean,
we could drop you off

11:14.074 --> 11:15.874
on our way to the, uh, adoption

11:15.876 --> 11:18.209
okay.
Not a problem.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.245
You know what this means
is your cassette player

11:20.247 --> 11:22.147
is gone for good.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.716
Yeah. I don't know how
I'm gonna get over that one.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.052
Tell me you didn't
have a tape in there.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.820
Thank god I did not.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.356
I had taken the tape out
and put it in the glove box.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.324
So, we're good.
Good.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.926
<i>What's the story with Jillian?</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:37.162
Is she an ex?
No.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.431
Jillian is a musician
and we used to play

11:39.433 --> 11:41.733
in bands together years ago.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.002
<i>One of the things that's
so great about our friendship</i>

11:44.004 --> 11:46.771
is that she is always
been, sort of,

11:46.773 --> 11:51.176
my last connection to...

11:51.178 --> 11:53.244
My youthful days of music

11:53.246 --> 11:54.879
<i>which was a big part of my life.</i>

11:54.881 --> 11:57.315
As a matter of fact,
she's pretty responsible

11:57.317 --> 11:59.751
for me going into comedy.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.120
<i>All right.
Mr. George Michael.</i>

12:29.049 --> 12:31.416
Party.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.791
All right, guys.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.226
Thank you so much.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.361
Have a great set and, um,

12:43.363 --> 12:46.264
don't forget to get
guitar-ded.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.866
<i>See you later.</i>
Very nice to meet you Zoe.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.833
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.035
Thanks again.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.171
- Henry.
- Hey. How are you doing?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.173
- It's been so long.
- Five years.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.875
- Yeah. You look great.
- Thanks.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.209
So, Jay Warren is inside.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.844
You're going up third.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.479
Everything is coming
together perfectly.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.149
- Okay.
- So, come with me.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.351
<i>A joyride? What,
are they gonna return it?</i>

13:06.353 --> 13:09.821
<i>I don't know.
Well meet the man himself.</i>

13:09.823 --> 13:11.823
<i>Jay Warren, mega-TV producer.</i>

13:11.825 --> 13:13.091
Henry Phillips,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.160
<i>singer-songwriter, troubadour</i>

13:15.162 --> 13:16.995
<i>extraordinaire, plays clubs</i>

13:16.997 --> 13:19.030
<i>and coffee houses nationwide.</i>

13:19.032 --> 13:21.065
Great to meet you.
Yeah. Good to meet you.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.367
How's la treating you so far?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.035
- Uh, well.
- Would you believe

13:24.037 --> 13:25.270
he just got his car stolen.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.337
- Really?
- Yes.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.439
That's hilarious.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.441
- Yeah.
- So, Jay says he's working

13:30.443 --> 13:32.377
on a new show idea
about the life

13:32.379 --> 13:33.511
<i>of a struggling performer.</i>

13:33.513 --> 13:35.213
Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh,

13:35.215 --> 13:37.215
it's something I've been
thinking about for quite

13:37.217 --> 13:39.150
a while now, and then I heard
about what happened to you,

13:39.152 --> 13:42.187
and I thought, "wow, I mean,
this is an incredible story."

13:42.189 --> 13:44.222
Yeah, I know, I've
had some pretty bad luck.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.191
Yeah. I'll say.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.026
I don't wanna interrupt but
I just wanna say hi to this guy.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.460
Hey, Charlie.
How are you doing?

13:49.462 --> 13:50.495
How are you doing, man?
This is Charlie.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.963
He's a fellow comedian.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.331
That's Ellen,
my manager and, uh...

13:53.333 --> 13:54.365
- Hi.
- My pleasure.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.934
This is Mr. Jay Warren.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.035
Uh, I'm a big fan of your work.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.336
Thank you. Thanks.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.470
Uh, everyone, this is Erica.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.239
Hey.
Nice to meet you.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.141
Uh, I didn't interrupt
some type of industry

14:03.143 --> 14:04.375
oh, no. Yes,

14:04.377 --> 14:06.044
so Charlie is a fellow comedian.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.146
He's very funny.
We've done the road together.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.950
Good times. And remember
the, um, the assassinator?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.484
Oh, he's the assassinator.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.086
We were in Omaha

14:15.088 --> 14:16.888
and there was this
champion UFC fighter

14:16.890 --> 14:19.357
called the assassinator and, uh,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.125
he got up to Henry and says,

14:21.127 --> 14:22.927
"you have to wish my
girlfriend a happy birthday

14:22.929 --> 14:25.964
from the stage
or I'll kick your ass."

14:25.966 --> 14:28.299
Henry is on stage and
he just doesn't say it

14:28.301 --> 14:32.103
and afterwards
the assassinator is pissed.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.172
<i>He's prowling around this club,</i>

14:34.174 --> 14:36.040
like, "I'm gonna kick
that guy's ass."

14:36.042 --> 14:37.408
I'm gonna break
that guy's guitar.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.444
"I'm gonna crush
that clown's skull."

14:39.446 --> 14:41.412
<i>"And I'm like," oh, whoa,
I didn't even know the guy.</i>

14:41.414 --> 14:43.915
I don't know where he is."
And I really didn't know

14:43.917 --> 14:46.651
where you were. It was hours
before anyone found him.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.254
The janitor goes to the
utility closet to get his mop

14:49.256 --> 14:51.623
and there's Henry,
lying on his side, crying.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.992
He's shitting himself.
Just, oh...

14:53.994 --> 14:55.660
The assassinator
is coming to get me.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.362
The assassinator
is coming to get me.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.530
I don't even, uh, remember that.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.999
Are you sure that was me

15:01.001 --> 15:02.433
because it's not
sounding familiar.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.137
No, no, that was you.
All right, okay.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.605
I'll see you after
the show and just

15:07.607 --> 15:09.040
really to both of you.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.009
Pleasure.
All right, man.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.945
Hey, you watch out
for the assassinator.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.381
I still don't even know
if that was me, really.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.548
It's weird.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.050
How long ago was that?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.585
I'm not sure that it happened.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.220
You must have a lot
of good story.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.955
I don't think
that's one of them.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.191
Billy...

15:30.162 --> 15:33.464
You had to do it didn't you?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.467
<i>You finally had to do it Billy.</i>

15:36.469 --> 15:38.136
Just when ma was starting

15:38.138 --> 15:41.005
to get up on her own
two feet, Billy.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.608
You son of a bitch.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.577
<i>Why, why, why
did you have to do that?</i>

15:46.579 --> 15:48.379
And with Bob's 38,

15:48.381 --> 15:51.316
what was that supposed
to be, huh?

15:51.318 --> 15:53.184
Irony?

15:53.186 --> 15:56.554
You selfish coward.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.023
<i>Why? Why, Billy,
why would you leave me</i>

15:59.025 --> 16:01.392
<i>and ma like this?</i>

16:03.195 --> 16:06.597
You were always good
at ruining the party Billy.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.599
Well...

16:08.601 --> 16:12.203
Fuck you Billy, fuck you.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.406
<i>Fuck you Billy.</i>

16:17.176 --> 16:18.576
Fuck you.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.124
Okay, wow.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.592
That was some heavy stuff.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.461
We're gonna change gears
a little bit here.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.296
<i>We have a singer-songwriter</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:40.031
<i>who's gonna come out and sing</i>

16:40.033 --> 16:42.033
<i>a little funny song
for you guys.</i>

16:42.035 --> 16:43.568
<i>Everybody, let's give
a warm hearty welcome</i>

16:43.570 --> 16:45.603
to Henry Phillips.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.106
Whoa.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.708
Thanks everybody.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.547
All right, um, well,

16:56.549 --> 16:57.749
I'm gonna do a little song about

16:57.751 --> 16:59.550
my current financial situation

16:59.552 --> 17:01.619
and I hope you guys enjoy it.

17:53.338 --> 17:56.140
You suck.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.775
All right.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.811
That's, uh,
one guys opinion, anyway,

17:59.813 --> 18:02.647
they might be right.
I don't know.

18:23.470 --> 18:27.472
It's over focal bird.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.486
Nice sneakers you dipshit.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.287
All right, you know what, um,

18:43.289 --> 18:44.422
maybe this wasn't meant to be.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.224
I, uh, I wanna say thanks

18:46.226 --> 18:47.892
to everybody, especially
that guy in the back.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.727
Come back when you grow
a set of balls man.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.362
I hope you guys all enjoy
the rest of your night,

18:51.364 --> 18:52.563
thank you.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.335
There he is.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.469
Oh, guys,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.204
I am so sorry about that.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.340
That was just awful.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.841
It was perfect.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.676
Well, that was just terrible.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.178
That guy was being such a dick.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.347
Hey, you know, it happens.
Yeah.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.815
<i>Listen, uh,
I got to run, I'm sorry,</i>

19:10.817 --> 19:12.450
but, uh, you should get
a call from my office

19:12.452 --> 19:14.218
this week, okay?
I'm gonna set something up

19:14.220 --> 19:16.554
in the network and we're gonna
tell your story Henry.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.356
Okay.
I can't wait to get started.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.790
That sounds good.
Hey, very nice to meet you.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.360
<i>- See you soon.
- Bye Jay.</i>

19:22.362 --> 19:24.428
He loved it.
Why?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.364
Well, because...

19:26.366 --> 19:28.633
He doesn't care
about a good set.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.835
I mean, sure you but he's more

19:30.837 --> 19:34.472
interested in you,
your story, your struggles.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.807
You heard him, he's so excited.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.776
I mean, let's just see what
he says about this meeting

19:38.778 --> 19:41.812
with the network.
I can't believe it.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.215
This is great.
Now look, I have to go too,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.651
but let me introduce you
to stupid Joe before I go.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.653
No, I'm good.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.423
Hey, Joe.
Hey. How are you?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.825
I'm good.
I wanna introduce you

19:54.827 --> 19:57.295
to Henry Phillips,
singer-songwriter,

19:57.297 --> 19:58.896
troubadour extraordinaire,

19:58.898 --> 20:00.398
and Jay Warren was just here

20:00.400 --> 20:01.899
to check him out
for a new TV show.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.269
Wow, impressive.
Nice to meet you.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.904
Hey, I got to apologize
about that heckler guy.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.674
What an asshole, you know.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.808
I guess we all figured out
why he's brother

20:10.810 --> 20:11.976
killed himself, right?

20:11.978 --> 20:13.744
Oh, Joe.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.813
Oh my god, I'm too old
for this comedy game.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.715
It's a young man's game,
but you got to make money.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.350
You know what I'm actually
thinking to do in getting

20:19.352 --> 20:20.785
into making a little money?

20:20.787 --> 20:22.587
Commercial jingles.
Oh, that's so smart.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.455
And actually, I got one
I've been working on,

20:24.457 --> 20:26.357
I'm gonna throw into the ring.
Tell me if you guys

20:26.359 --> 20:27.792
think this is good, you know,
the Hollywood casino?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.328
They have... their
slogan is satisfaction.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.697
Tell me if you guys just
think this is a good jingle.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.469
Oh, that'll work.
That's very catchy.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.770
Yeah, pretty good, all right.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.272
Anyways, I got to get going,

20:41.274 --> 20:42.540
please come by here anytime,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.408
work out your stuff, you know.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.910
We got to get some come
back lines for you, like,

20:45.912 --> 20:47.478
"hey, I don't come to your job

20:47.480 --> 20:48.713
and knock a dick
out of your mouth."

20:48.715 --> 20:50.281
Stuff like that, you know.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.749
Show these assholes
who's in charge.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.452
Well, I got to catch
the last bus on that note.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.786
And how are you getting home?

20:55.788 --> 20:56.887
Uh, I'm just gonna take a cab.

20:56.889 --> 20:57.989
You're a bus and a cab,

20:57.991 --> 20:59.490
what is this, uh, 1990?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.392
Don't... you guys
don't have Uber?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.793
Anyways, listen, I got to
start kicking people out.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.362
<i>Okay.</i>
Nice to meet you.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.730
Ellen always a pleasure.
Always.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.865
You're beautiful.
Thank you.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.934
Look, I have a card for EZ cab.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.303
They're really good.
Okay, great. By the way,

21:12.305 --> 21:13.871
you don't have to say
all my credits every time

21:13.873 --> 21:14.972
you introduce me to somebody.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.474
Oh, but if I don't,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.309
no one would ever
wanna talk to you.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.871
<i>Yeah, I guess so.
That's a good point.</i>

21:32.859 --> 21:35.059
Hey, you still here?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.594
Oh, hey, yeah.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.728
I've been waiting
for a cab for, like,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.063
an hour and a half.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.531
Why don't you just
call them again,

21:40.533 --> 21:41.832
tell them you're somebody else.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.601
What does that do?

21:43.603 --> 21:44.802
Well, then there'll
be two cars showing up,

21:44.804 --> 21:46.304
it doubles your chances.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.905
Yeah, maybe I'll try that.
Yeah.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.340
<i>Hey, and, uh, Henry, uh, anytime</i>

21:49.342 --> 21:50.508
<i>you wanna come by the club,</i>

21:50.510 --> 21:51.942
<i>the door is always open.</i>

21:51.944 --> 21:54.345
It's a $10 cover,
two drink minimum.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.591
<i>EZ cab.</i>
Yeah, hey, uh,

22:07.593 --> 22:09.093
I got to get a cab.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.661
<i>Yeah, what's your location?</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:12.096
I'm at, uh, stupid Joe's comedy

22:12.098 --> 22:14.632
and music club on sunset.

22:14.634 --> 22:18.936
Stupid Joe's, did you just
call... uh, is this Henry?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.471
- No.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

22:20.473 --> 22:21.639
Because I just scheduled
a pick up

22:21.641 --> 22:23.441
at stupid Joe's for a Henry.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.109
What's your name?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.578
Manny.
Danny?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.380
Yeah, Danny.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.614
And you're sure you're not part

22:30.616 --> 22:32.083
of the Henry party at all?

22:32.085 --> 22:34.051
I'm not sending two cabs
for no reason.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.654
No, this is definitely Danny.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.955
Yeah.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.818
<i>3835 Tracy street, please.</i>

23:10.989 --> 23:13.791
Do you mind, uh, if we take
silver lake boulevard?

23:13.793 --> 23:15.493
<i>You got it.</i>

23:26.805 --> 23:28.973
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah, is this Danny,</i>

23:28.975 --> 23:30.775
or should I say Henry,

23:30.777 --> 23:32.543
or should i... should
I just say dickhead?

23:32.545 --> 23:34.879
You just had me send
two cabs for nothing.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.081
Dude, I was standing there
for like an hour and a half,

23:37.083 --> 23:38.783
and nobody was coming
to pick me up.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.184
I mean, I'm sorry
to put you out,

23:40.186 --> 23:42.086
but frankly
this isn't my problem.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.888
<i>Sorry to put me out,
how about you apologize</i>

23:43.890 --> 23:46.457
to my cab driver who just
had to hump his way

23:46.459 --> 23:48.526
through the canyon
because you're over there

23:48.528 --> 23:52.463
getting a laugh at
stupid Mike's comedy shithole.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.899
<i>You know, these guys have
to pay for their own gas.</i>

23:54.901 --> 23:56.033
Hello?

23:59.838 --> 24:04.175
<i>I was very reluctant
to go la because...</i>

24:04.177 --> 24:06.710
It's a little too, uh,

24:06.712 --> 24:08.846
I don't know how you'd
say it, like, too...

24:08.848 --> 24:10.748
<i>Opportunistic.</i>

24:10.750 --> 24:12.550
<i>I don't know.
I've always found that</i>

24:12.552 --> 24:15.653
<i>if you just put
positive energy out there</i>

24:15.655 --> 24:19.557
<i>then people will definitely
take advantage of you.</i>

24:28.768 --> 24:30.134
<i>EZ cab.</i>
Hi, yeah.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.602
I'm pretty sure
I left my cell phone

24:31.604 --> 24:33.671
in one of your cabs last night.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.840
What was the, uh,
location of the pick up?

24:35.842 --> 24:37.842
Uh, it was at stupid
Joe's comedy

24:37.844 --> 24:39.710
and music club over on sunset.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.645
Oh, stupid Joe's, let me guess,

24:41.647 --> 24:44.582
you're the fucking genius
that called two cabs aren't you?

24:44.584 --> 24:45.716
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:45.718 --> 24:48.786
Uh, I guess, I, um...

24:48.788 --> 24:50.721
I guess I really owe
you an apology about that.

24:50.723 --> 24:51.789
I'm sorry, I, uh...

24:51.791 --> 24:52.923
Oh, you're goddamn right

24:52.925 --> 24:54.592
you owe me an apology.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.927
Yeah, I was just,
uh, being selfish, um...

24:56.929 --> 24:58.829
You were being a dick man.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.699
<i>Yeah, I think you're
right about that.</i>

25:01.701 --> 25:03.968
<i>You know how much
aggravation and shit I get</i>

25:03.970 --> 25:05.636
<i>from my driver's when
they have to drive</i>

25:05.638 --> 25:07.137
<i>all the way
to the fucking valley?</i>

25:07.139 --> 25:09.039
Actually, you know what man,
I take it back.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.941
<i>I don't apologize.
I was standing there for,</i>

25:10.943 --> 25:12.142
<i>like, a fucking hour</i>

25:12.144 --> 25:13.744
and nobody was picking me up.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.145
I could've gotten mugged
or something.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.014
I'm tired of hearing you
bitch about it

25:17.016 --> 25:18.649
<i>and everybody's telling me
this Uber thing</i>

25:18.651 --> 25:19.984
<i>is a million times
better anyway,</i>

25:19.986 --> 25:21.986
so why don't you go
fuck yourself.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.894
<i>Today, 10:17 am.</i>

25:29.896 --> 25:31.662
<i>Hey, sorry about last night,</i>

25:31.664 --> 25:33.297
<i>I wind up banging
that Erica chick.</i>

25:33.299 --> 25:35.199
<i>She is okay.
She's gonna be the last girl</i>

25:35.201 --> 25:37.301
<i>in la who still
has a hairy crotch.</i>

25:37.303 --> 25:39.937
<i>Come on, lady, shave that thing
down there, um, all right?</i>

25:39.939 --> 25:42.273
<i>Shave the cooch.
I went down under though.</i>

25:42.275 --> 25:44.608
<i>Um, what did I call about?</i>

25:44.610 --> 25:46.911
<i>I just wanna say hi.
Let's hang out soon.</i>

25:46.913 --> 25:48.178
<i>Bye.</i>

25:49.648 --> 25:51.916
<i>Today, 10:18 am.</i>

25:51.918 --> 25:54.818
<i>You hang up on me you
piece of shit coward.</i>

25:54.820 --> 25:57.154
<i>You tell me to go fuck
myself to my face,</i>

25:57.156 --> 25:59.657
<i>why don't you do that?
Come down here...</i>

25:59.659 --> 26:00.925
Hey.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.626
You got home
all right last night?

26:02.628 --> 26:05.596
Yeah. I, uh, just wound up
taking a taxi.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.765
Cool, how did the gig go?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.601
Well, let's see.
I got basically booed off

26:10.603 --> 26:13.771
the stage but Jay Warren
loved it, so.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.873
Well, I'm sorry,

26:15.875 --> 26:18.943
but congratulations?

26:18.945 --> 26:20.945
Yeah. Thank you.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.247
Listen, um, my band clit fit

26:23.249 --> 26:26.050
is performing
at this really cool

26:26.052 --> 26:27.918
house party on Saturday night.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.587
Would you wanna open?

26:29.589 --> 26:31.655
It pays like 50 bucks.
Oh, that's awesome.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.257
Yeah.
I would love to do that.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.059
That's actually the first
time I've ever been offered

26:35.061 --> 26:36.727
money to do a gig out here.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.828
Yeah. And maybe
you can get booed off

26:37.830 --> 26:39.630
of our stage and wind up

26:39.632 --> 26:41.632
with a three-picture deal
with Paramount pictures.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.801
That's... I wouldn't
be surprised.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.070
I would, but for sure
it won't happen.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.706
Anyway, uh, obviously,
I need to get a ride with you,

26:48.708 --> 26:51.141
if that's all right?
Totally. That's perfect

26:51.143 --> 26:53.010
because I've been wanting
you to see our stuff.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.346
Yeah. And I'm looking
forward to it.

26:55.348 --> 26:58.382
Um, are you missing something?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.017
Yeah, have you seen my wallet?

27:00.019 --> 27:01.752
I have not.

27:01.754 --> 27:05.356
Did you by chance
leave it in the cab?

27:05.358 --> 27:06.924
Uh,

27:07.926 --> 27:09.059
hmm.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.227
<i>I bet you did.</i>

27:10.229 --> 27:12.096
Yeah, shit.

27:24.743 --> 27:27.044
Oh, hey, it's, uh, Henry.

27:27.046 --> 27:30.047
I'm the guy who left his wallet.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.750
Oh, Henry Phillips.
Yes.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.885
Yeah, my good buddy,
Henry Phillips.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.321
You called two cabs on me,
screwed my driver,

27:37.323 --> 27:40.190
cursed me out,
hang up in my face.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.127
How many cabs did it take
you to get here today?

27:43.129 --> 27:47.064
Jesus, I was, uh... I was
expecting more of a stoned

27:47.066 --> 27:49.700
drunken dumb Bon Jovi.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.336
Did you lose your hair
in one of my cabs as well?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.138
Yeah.
Old two cab Henry.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.806
<i>It's an old picture, so, uh...</i>

27:55.808 --> 27:57.675
I guess, that's you.
I think the last time

27:57.677 --> 28:00.144
we talked you were telling me
I should go fuck myself.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.712
You told me to go fuck myself

28:01.714 --> 28:03.313
and then you rubbed
Uber on my face.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.049
The company
that's single-handedly

28:05.051 --> 28:07.051
destroying my fucking industry?

28:07.053 --> 28:08.952
Let me ask you a question, Hank.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.721
Do you think your good
friends over at Uber

28:10.723 --> 28:12.256
would've returned your wallet?

28:12.258 --> 28:14.224
Do you think those scumbag

28:14.226 --> 28:16.360
pirating unlicensed criminals

28:16.362 --> 28:18.362
would have returned
your fucking wallet?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.964
Why don't you take your last
six dollars in this wallet

28:20.966 --> 28:22.733
and, uh, take an Uber cab,

28:22.735 --> 28:25.135
and I hope you get fucking
chlamydia from it.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.972
Oh, and go fuck yourself.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.756
Do you mind if I join you here?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.991
Oh, yeah, sure.
Oh, thank you.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.470
Hmm, the chicken's really good.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.939
I wouldn't know,
I got the eggplant.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.474
Oh, are you a lesbian?

29:03.476 --> 29:06.944
I mean a vegetarian?
I'm sorry, god.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.278
That was awful.
That's okay.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.448
Um, yes, I am and yes, I am.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.850
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.985
God, stupid.
Hey, you guys.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.054
Hey, guys, how's it going?

29:17.056 --> 29:18.889
Have you met each
other yet? Henry...

29:18.891 --> 29:20.357
Not officially.
Sascha.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.826
Hey, how you doing?
Nice to meet you.

29:22.828 --> 29:25.829
Sascha plays bass
in our band and, uh

29:25.831 --> 29:28.899
Henry is my old friend
from like 20 years ago.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.167
He's opening for us tonight.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.902
Oh, yeah, I heard
a lot about you.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.303
Yeah, it'll be cool.
I'm looking forward

29:33.305 --> 29:36.406
to seeing you guys play,
the clit fit.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.976
Uh, Jillian says you tour
all around the country.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.979
Uh-hmm.
Shit room to shit room.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.848
Hold on.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.817
<i>Perfect timing,
whoever that was.</i>

29:46.819 --> 29:49.253
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.021
Hey, Ellen, how's it going?

29:51.023 --> 29:52.956
<i>Henry, I just got a
call from Jay.</i>

29:52.958 --> 29:54.491
<i>You won't believe this.</i>

29:54.493 --> 29:55.959
<i>We have a meeting
Monday afternoon</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:57.361
<i>with the now channel.</i>

29:57.363 --> 29:59.930
That's amazing.
That's fantastic.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.432
<i>See, I told you this was
gonna be exciting.</i>

30:02.434 --> 30:04.268
<i>Where are you?</i>
I'm at a party

30:04.270 --> 30:06.403
with my friend Jillian,
and actually her band

30:06.405 --> 30:08.572
is gonna play,
and I'm gonna open for them.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.941
<i>Oh, well, go knock them dead.</i>

30:10.943 --> 30:14.912
What was the first comedy
song you ever wrote?

30:14.914 --> 30:16.847
<i>Well, years ago,</i>

30:16.849 --> 30:19.049
uh, my friend Jillian,
she was going through

30:19.051 --> 30:21.118
a break up or something and I
was trying to cheer her up,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.187
so I just, like,
pulled out the guitar

30:23.189 --> 30:26.423
and I started singing headlines

30:26.425 --> 30:28.192
right out of the newspaper,

30:28.194 --> 30:31.428
<i>and she was laughing
at it, and, uh,</i>

30:31.430 --> 30:34.364
she was, like, you know,
"maybe you should go around the,

30:34.366 --> 30:36.133
like, open mic nights
and do that."

30:36.135 --> 30:38.402
Can we hear it,
your first comedy song?

30:38.404 --> 30:42.573
I have a guitar behind you,
if you don't mind.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.541
- Yeah.
<i>- Yay.</i>

30:44.543 --> 30:48.545
I wanna hear the song
that cheered up Jillian.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.380
Yeah.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.382
So, yeah, I was just, like, uh,

30:52.384 --> 30:54.451
playing these chords
and trying to cheer her up,

30:54.453 --> 30:56.486
and I was, like,

31:06.097 --> 31:08.899
and then I grabbed the newspaper
and it was, like,

32:02.020 --> 32:04.054
in Spanish.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.211
It's real Spanish.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.592
Thanks, everybody.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.361
<i>Thank you so much. Thanks.</i>

32:44.363 --> 32:45.963
That's amazing.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.431
Hi.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.337
You guys, uh, hi.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.172
Okay.

33:35.246 --> 33:38.548
<i>This is the modern day Sisyphus.</i>

33:38.550 --> 33:41.018
A road weary entertainer,

33:41.020 --> 33:42.686
pushing the Boulder of hope

33:42.688 --> 33:46.256
up the rocky mountain
of desperation.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.593
Only to have it roll back down
on him time after time,

33:49.595 --> 33:52.062
after time, but we like him.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.130
We're on his side.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.264
We want him to succeed

33:54.266 --> 33:56.333
because we identify with him.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.503
He's, like, a real life
Charlie brown.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.139
Only instead of snoopy
and Linus,

34:02.141 --> 34:05.375
his friends are failure
and despair.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.411
So, he's a blockhead?

34:07.413 --> 34:09.045
Yeah, sure yeah,
he's a blockhead.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.347
Yeah.
I see you.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.282
Yeah.
And we're rooting for him.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.150
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
<i>- Because he sacrificed</i>

34:14.152 --> 34:16.053
the good life
to do what the rest of us

34:16.054 --> 34:17.254
could only dream of.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.388
Yeah, he has no friends,

34:18.389 --> 34:20.056
no money, no love life,

34:20.059 --> 34:21.792
not even the respect
of his peers.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.427
But we care about him

34:23.429 --> 34:26.362
simply because he's doing it.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.598
Sisyphus meets Charlie brown?

34:30.333 --> 34:32.268
- I like it.
<i>- I like it, too.</i>

34:32.271 --> 34:35.138
I do, I like it.
I mean, if a normal person

34:35.139 --> 34:36.739
had that life,
they would do something

34:36.742 --> 34:37.774
- to change it, right?
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

34:37.775 --> 34:39.443
Or just

34:39.445 --> 34:43.080
you know,
but this guy just keeps,

34:43.081 --> 34:45.415
kind of, going on,
and on, and on,

34:45.417 --> 34:47.350
- and god knows why, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34:47.351 --> 34:49.252
<i>Yeah.</i>
He's like a loser's loser.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.654
<i>Sure, yeah, yeah.</i>

34:50.656 --> 34:52.556
- Or a loser's hero.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34:52.558 --> 34:55.659
Or a loser who could make
a loser feel like a hero.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.594
Guys, I'm right here.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.265
Right?
"Guys, I'm right here."

35:02.267 --> 35:03.767
Sincerely, I have not been
this excited

35:03.769 --> 35:06.269
about an idea
in a very long time.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.637
You're excited?
I'm excited.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.873
I like it.
Jay, it is so good

35:09.875 --> 35:11.641
to see you again.
Thanks, Carl.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.176
Thanks for that.
Thanks for bringing this to us.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.678
Yeah, you bet.
Henry, nice to meet you.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.346
<i>Mara, I need you
to wrap this up.</i>

35:16.348 --> 35:17.614
- Okay.
<i>- Okay. Put a bow on it.</i>

35:17.616 --> 35:19.416
- I will do that.
<i>- Great.</i>

35:19.418 --> 35:21.284
Okay.
Well, where do we start?

35:21.286 --> 35:23.120
Well, we'll do a pilot, right?

35:23.122 --> 35:24.387
And I'll direct it.
I guarantee you it will be...

35:24.389 --> 35:25.655
<i>You know, my suggestion</i>

35:25.657 --> 35:27.324
is we get Henry's materials

35:27.326 --> 35:29.126
over to the new
media department,

35:29.128 --> 35:32.229
<i>because we wanna
create a lot of buzz.</i>

35:32.231 --> 35:34.131
Right now,
our most successful show,

35:34.133 --> 35:35.832
an idiot dad, that's based

35:35.834 --> 35:39.136
on a 15-year-old
kid's video blog.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.204
<i>This kid managed
to get a million</i>

35:41.206 --> 35:42.706
friendlings to his chumpster,

35:42.708 --> 35:45.475
just by social media
alone, what?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.344
<i>So, when the chumpsterverse
found out</i>

35:47.346 --> 35:49.146
<i>that we were doing a TV show,</i>

35:49.148 --> 35:51.281
well, they went nuts.
And those friendlings

35:51.283 --> 35:52.782
they turned
into Nielsen ratings...

35:52.784 --> 35:54.651
Wait, I'm sorry.
Uh, chumpsterverse?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.186
Is that a TV station?

35:56.188 --> 35:57.854
Okay. That's an online community

35:57.856 --> 35:59.789
that the younger demographic
is going to,

35:59.791 --> 36:02.225
to get their entertainment
right now.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.828
<i>Yeah, these guys are real
wizards at this.</i>

36:04.830 --> 36:07.831
They were the real geniuses
behind getting idiot dad

36:07.833 --> 36:09.633
to be an idiot dad.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.735
Uh, I'm sorry,
what does that do?

36:11.737 --> 36:13.170
Uh, when you make it
"an idiot dad?"

36:13.172 --> 36:14.404
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Henry,</i>

36:14.406 --> 36:16.239
<i>it's called Alpha stacking.</i>

36:16.241 --> 36:18.508
So, if you have a title
that starts with a for example,

36:18.510 --> 36:20.844
like, an idiot dad,
then all of a sudden

36:20.846 --> 36:23.246
now it really optimizes
the search engines

36:23.248 --> 36:24.848
<i>- and the VOD placement.
- Okay.</i>

36:24.850 --> 36:26.283
- Right. Yeah, good.
<i>- Alpha stacking.</i>

36:26.285 --> 36:28.318
So, uh, what do you want
from us?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.887
Well, I think if we can get
one of Henry's little,

36:30.889 --> 36:33.823
um, silly songs
over to Matt and Zack,

36:33.825 --> 36:35.192
<i>and they could put it up
on chumpster.</i>

36:35.194 --> 36:36.626
Uh-hmm.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.428
I don't know,
let's see how it does.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.397
Right? Can't hurt.
And everything these guys touch

36:40.399 --> 36:42.399
really does go viral.
Did you guys happen to catch

36:42.401 --> 36:44.434
what they did
with the American skin...

36:44.436 --> 36:45.936
<i>Oh, I love that one.</i>
Promo campaign could... yeah.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.304
It's where the Hollywood
masseur has sex

36:47.306 --> 36:48.438
with all of his customers.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.906
Yeah, tattoo artist, yeah.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.841
And these guys
are just really amazing.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.577
And, you know,
if we could get a song

36:53.579 --> 36:55.579
actually it's got some
good keywords in it,

36:55.581 --> 36:57.380
that would really help
with trafficking,

36:57.382 --> 36:58.915
<i>you know, something,
like, cocks, balls</i>

36:58.917 --> 37:01.484
- and tits, farts, uh...
<i>- Oh.</i>

37:01.486 --> 37:05.288
Clits.
Maybe and balls and tits, right?

37:05.290 --> 37:07.657
You know, uncle stupid Joe,

37:07.659 --> 37:09.593
and we could set up
a taping there.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.528
I mean, if he knows
it's for now channel...

37:11.530 --> 37:13.330
Well, that's a good place
to shoot, good sound,

37:13.332 --> 37:15.532
good lighting, yeah,
and we could knock it out.

37:15.534 --> 37:16.900
Okay. Terrific.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.368
<i>Great. Excellent.</i>
Terrific.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.470
Thanks, Mara.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.805
- Great meeting you.
<i>- Pleasure.</i>

37:21.807 --> 37:24.341
Oh. Nice to see you.
Thank you.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.709
Well, welcome to la.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.943
Yeah.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.478
Did you park in the garage?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.380
Actually, um...
His car got stolen.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.815
Oh, no, when?

37:31.817 --> 37:32.983
It was literally
like a half hour

37:32.985 --> 37:36.586
after I got to la.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.988
Cops are trying to find it.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.356
Well, yeah, that'll happen.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.425
Sucks.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.793
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.795
That should be
the first episode.

37:47.031 --> 37:48.632
<i>So, here I am, a young guy,</i>

37:48.634 --> 37:50.333
basically fresh
off the bus, right?

37:50.335 --> 37:52.002
Here in la.
No clue.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.470
Wet behind the ears.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.372
Uh-hmm.
But I know one thing.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.474
I know what I want.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.309
Unfortunately,
I got a distant cousin

37:59.311 --> 38:01.278
who manages to set me up
a meeting with the guy,

38:01.280 --> 38:03.947
a producer who's pretty high
up the ladder at MGM.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.549
Okay.
So, we're having lunch

38:06.551 --> 38:09.753
and it's going fine,
you know, small talk.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.855
And then I don't know
where I got the nerve

38:11.857 --> 38:13.290
to do this, but, uh,

38:13.292 --> 38:14.357
right in the middle of lunch

38:14.359 --> 38:15.825
I just dropped my fork,

38:15.827 --> 38:17.294
I looked the guy in the eyes
and I go,

38:17.296 --> 38:19.829
"I want in."

38:19.831 --> 38:21.498
And he's looking at me, like,

38:21.500 --> 38:23.633
"what in? In what?"
You know.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.934
And I go, "you know
what I'm talking about",

38:24.936 --> 38:26.670
in the business.

38:26.672 --> 38:29.472
"And I know you're a guy
who can get me there."

38:29.474 --> 38:32.309
I said, "hey, I might be nobody",

38:32.311 --> 38:33.843
but a few years from now?
I'm gonna be somebody

38:33.845 --> 38:35.312
to be reckoned with in this town

38:35.314 --> 38:37.714
and if you don't
help me out now,

38:37.716 --> 38:39.416
I might not be
all that easy to deal with

38:39.418 --> 38:42.419
when our paths cross again."
That was it.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.820
I was in.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.689
Wow, that's how you do it.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.390
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll say, yeah.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.658
I mean, people can sense
when you're determined,

38:48.660 --> 38:50.427
you know.
And they don't wanna get

38:50.429 --> 38:51.461
in the way of that.
Yeah, I wish I had a little bit

38:51.463 --> 38:53.830
more of that in me.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.031
You see this before?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.733
The celebrity tombstones?

38:56.735 --> 38:58.668
Merv Griffin,

38:58.670 --> 39:00.804
<i>"I will not be right back
after this message."</i>

39:00.806 --> 39:02.472
- All right, that's good.
- That's good.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.973
My absolute favorite
is Rodney Dangerfield,

39:03.975 --> 39:06.676
he knew his plaque
was next to Dean Martin

39:06.678 --> 39:08.545
and, uh, Marilyn Monroe.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.747
So, the epitaph,
there goes the neighborhood.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.849
<i>- Oh, yeah, it's very...
- I love Rodney.</i>

39:12.851 --> 39:15.685
Who's Arnie "rimshot" Roberts?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.587
You see,
he was another comedian.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.789
<i>People don't really talk
about him here anymore.</i>

39:19.791 --> 39:22.959
<i>Always a gentleman,
but never a gentleman.</i>

39:24.795 --> 39:26.629
I think I know
why nobody talks about him.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.064
No, there was a story
behind that.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.600
Apparently,
what Arnie really meant was,

39:30.602 --> 39:33.803
always a gentleman,
but never a gentle man.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.438
Oh, okay.
Okay?

39:35.440 --> 39:36.840
And then, after he died,

39:36.842 --> 39:39.042
some moron assistant
just typed it up wrong

39:39.044 --> 39:40.877
and sent it off
to the mortuary like that.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.013
Wait, so, this guy's
got a typo on his tombstone?

39:44.015 --> 39:47.484
Because this idiot assistant
didn't get the joke?

39:47.486 --> 39:50.019
<i>Yeah, pretty much.</i>

39:50.021 --> 39:51.888
Well, that bums me out.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.123
- Depressing.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

39:58.529 --> 40:00.029
Oh, hey, uh, stupid.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.866
Hey, look at this,
the big TV star, get in here.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.467
Oh, yeah.
Heard about the network deal.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.069
Congratulations to you, sir.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.737
- Thanks.
- Hey, uh, ask them

40:07.739 --> 40:09.572
if they need a theme song.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.974
Actually, you know what?
I got a new one.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.675
I think it's gonna be a big hit.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.411
Tell me what you think of this.
Uh-hmm.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.487
Okay. So, it's like... yeah, yeah.
A Christian song?

40:24.489 --> 40:26.089
<i>Christian, Christian song, yeah.</i>

40:26.091 --> 40:28.825
Oh, are you Christian or?
No, no, here's the deal.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.927
I love religions of all type.
Yeah, yeah.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.162
As long they're good people,
you know.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.530
Oh, sure.
But the deal is,

40:33.532 --> 40:35.498
nobody's music anymore.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.768
Except for Christian rock.
Christians.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.637
Exactly.
So, I'm thinking, hell,

40:40.639 --> 40:43.440
I can probably write the shit
out of a Christian song.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.708
Why not throw my hat
into the ring, right?

40:45.710 --> 40:47.477
- Sure.
<i>- Anyways, congratulations</i>

40:47.479 --> 40:48.845
<i>on your success.</i>
Oh, thanks.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.613
Well, it's still
just a development deal.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.115
Just a development?
What is wrong with you?

40:52.117 --> 40:53.950
You just sold a show
to the now channel.

40:53.952 --> 40:56.619
Why don't you live a little?
Hey, can I help you?

40:56.621 --> 40:58.521
Yeah. Hi, I'm Dave.
I'm from the now channel

40:58.523 --> 40:59.923
- to check...
<i>- Oh, yeah, you're here</i>

40:59.925 --> 41:01.658
<i>to tape this guy, right?</i>
Yeah.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.892
Oh, good.
Well, just go talk to Lance,

41:02.894 --> 41:04.594
he'll take care of everything.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.095
Okay, great.
Because I just wanna ask him

41:06.097 --> 41:07.797
about lighting
and then some sound issues

41:07.799 --> 41:11.000
and, uh, my penis is in my anus.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.969
There you go.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.504
Big fan.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.773
I appreciate it.
Penis in my anus.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.842
<i>Thank you very much.
Wow, that's an oldie.</i>

41:18.844 --> 41:21.711
Well, I used to intern
at x company record, so.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.213
Hey, Fabian man, I love him.

41:23.215 --> 41:24.547
And I ran to him
at a coffee shop

41:24.549 --> 41:25.815
the other day.
Uh-hmm.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.183
I asked him
how things are going.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.018
He asked me if I needed
room for cream.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.222
Fucking rich.
All right, Dave.

41:32.224 --> 41:33.823
Go take yours.
Nice meeting you,

41:33.825 --> 41:35.225
I appreciate you, good luck.
Likewise.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.961
All right. Bye.
Dickies, let's go-es.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.601
I think your persona
definitely matches

41:44.603 --> 41:45.802
the jokes that you do.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.137
And I've seen a lot of comics,

41:48.139 --> 41:49.839
that try to avoid that.
And I don't know,

41:49.841 --> 41:51.207
I think
what you're doing's great.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.876
Really?
That's so good to hear.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.077
Because a lot of my friends
and family

41:54.079 --> 41:55.645
think that I'm not fat enough

41:55.647 --> 41:56.980
to tell fat jokes about myself.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.748
Oh, I think you are.

41:58.750 --> 41:59.983
- I mean, uh...
<i>- Hey, like, hey,</i>

41:59.985 --> 42:01.150
there you are.
Oh, gosh.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.886
Come, come with me.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.021
I invited some people
from my tennis club

42:05.023 --> 42:07.690
and they're right over here.
Let me introduce you.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.893
- Hi, everybody.
<i>- Hello.</i>

42:09.895 --> 42:12.529
This is Henry,
and this is frank.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.863
Hi, frank.
Uh, Phil.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.031
<i>Oh, Phil.
I'm sorry.</i>

42:15.033 --> 42:16.833
You're frank.
No.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.202
Mark?
I'm Jim, this is my wife, Mary.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.970
Uh, I'm sorry.
Who are you?

42:20.972 --> 42:23.172
Oh, I'm Ellen.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.642
And this was Henry, you know,

42:25.644 --> 42:26.943
singer or songwriter.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.778
Troubadour extraordinaire.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.680
And let me make sure
I get this right.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.750
He's a singer, songwriter,
troubadour extraordinaire

42:33.752 --> 42:36.853
who plays clubs
and coffee houses nationwide.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.054
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up

42:38.056 --> 42:40.590
for Henry Phillips.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.664
Hey, thanks, everybody.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.098
This is just a song

42:49.100 --> 42:51.067
that I wrote
and I hope you enjoy it.

44:01.706 --> 44:04.207
Hey, Henry,
so I just spoke to Jay.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.908
And he said Mara
at the now channel

44:05.910 --> 44:07.677
<i>really liked the video</i>

44:07.679 --> 44:09.212
<i>and they're ready
to make an offer.</i>

44:09.214 --> 44:10.747
Oh, that's awesome.
Did they say anything

44:10.749 --> 44:12.649
about when we were
gonna get paid?

44:12.651 --> 44:14.117
Well, Jay said
it might take a little while,

44:14.119 --> 44:15.818
but I could get you
some regional gigs

44:15.820 --> 44:17.987
to sign you over
if you're up for it.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.923
How about next Thursday
at the nugget hotel in Nevada?

44:20.925 --> 44:23.326
I had a client in there earlier,
but he pulled out,

44:23.328 --> 44:24.827
so this would be perfect.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.829
And that pays 500 bucks.

44:26.831 --> 44:29.666
And then, if you go up there
the night before,

44:29.668 --> 44:33.069
uh, there's a place called
the folk house in Ukiah.

44:33.071 --> 44:35.371
And they $250 and both of these,

44:35.373 --> 44:37.140
of course, include hotel.

44:37.142 --> 44:39.008
I guess, I should
probably write this down.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.109
<i>Oh, nonsense, Henry.</i>

44:40.111 --> 44:41.711
<i>I'll send you an email.</i>

44:41.713 --> 44:43.713
Come on,
this is the 20th century.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.682
Oh, and here's the best news.
You could take the greyhound bus

44:45.684 --> 44:46.983
for the whole trip
and it won't cost you

44:46.985 --> 44:48.785
more than a hundred bucks.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.119
<i>So, should I lock it in
for next weekend?</i>

44:50.121 --> 44:51.821
Yeah, let's do it.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.959
Hey. Good morning.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.928
- Oh, hey, guys, how's it going?
<i>- Good.</i>

44:58.930 --> 45:01.698
Just making some gourmet coffee
that I bought.

45:01.700 --> 45:04.367
Ooh, congrats.
Yeah.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.269
Hey, um, do you have a minute?

45:06.271 --> 45:08.271
Yeah. Is everything okay or?

45:08.273 --> 45:12.041
Yeah, we just wanna talk to you.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.810
<i>Nothing bad.</i>
Okay. Yeah.

45:15.913 --> 45:17.980
Okay.

45:17.982 --> 45:21.417
What's happening?
Well, um,

45:21.419 --> 45:23.286
our, uh, adoption plans

45:23.288 --> 45:26.155
are starting to look
kind of iffy

45:26.157 --> 45:29.358
and we... we're, kind of,
getting cold feet

45:29.360 --> 45:32.128
about the fost-adopt process.
Yeah.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.363
- Sorry to hear that.
<i>- Yeah, thanks.</i>

45:34.365 --> 45:37.767
And so, Zoe and I

45:37.769 --> 45:41.738
were thinking about...

45:41.740 --> 45:43.372
Well, we're wondering

45:43.374 --> 45:45.441
if you would father our child.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.779
Yeah, I mean,
if you think about it, Henry,

45:49.781 --> 45:52.749
it makes perfect sense.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.751
I mean, you and I are...

45:54.753 --> 45:56.285
<i>No.
I know what you guys</i>

45:56.287 --> 45:57.987
have been going through
and how hard it's gonna be

45:57.989 --> 46:01.124
and, you know,
I would do anything for you.

46:01.126 --> 46:04.260
<i>Thanks.</i>
But, um,

46:04.262 --> 46:06.996
I mean, that's a pretty heavy
thing to think about.

46:06.998 --> 46:09.332
Like, would i...
Would I be involved

46:09.334 --> 46:11.768
in the child's life?
Oh, god, no.

46:11.770 --> 46:13.402
We wouldn't let you
near the child.

46:13.404 --> 46:14.971
Oh, yeah.

46:14.973 --> 46:18.040
Um, I, uh...

46:18.042 --> 46:19.976
And then, how does that work?

46:19.978 --> 46:21.277
Like, is it, like,

46:21.279 --> 46:23.980
- a in vitro or...
<i>- No, no.</i>

46:23.982 --> 46:26.315
Actually, that's
a very expensive procedure

46:26.317 --> 46:28.351
and it's not always successful.

46:28.353 --> 46:30.119
<i>Uh-hmm.</i>
So, what we were hoping for

46:30.121 --> 46:33.456
was that we could do it
the old-fashioned way.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.958
You know, wearing bonnets.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
I'm sorry.
Old-fashioned

46:37.962 --> 46:40.263
and that would mean,

46:40.265 --> 46:42.165
unfortunately, you'd have
to have sex with Zoe,

46:42.167 --> 46:44.500
<i>so my apologies ahead of time.</i>

46:44.502 --> 46:46.068
You know, we're both okay

46:46.070 --> 46:49.138
with the idea of you
guys having sex

46:49.140 --> 46:52.441
and, um, we just really
wanna make sure

46:52.443 --> 46:53.543
you're comfortable

46:53.545 --> 46:55.545
and that you know

46:55.547 --> 46:59.182
<i>that there is zero obligation
on your part.</i>

46:59.184 --> 47:01.484
And that we're more than happy

47:01.486 --> 47:04.453
to have a contract with you,

47:04.455 --> 47:06.055
<i>or just...</i>
Well, that's not the issue.

47:06.057 --> 47:08.357
I mean, um,

47:08.359 --> 47:10.092
I guess, it's just...
It's pretty heavy.

47:10.094 --> 47:12.128
- So, I'm trying to kind of...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

47:12.130 --> 47:14.297
<i>And honestly, we don't
need an answer right now.</i>

47:14.299 --> 47:16.465
<i>You can think about it.
If you have any questions,</i>

47:16.467 --> 47:17.900
there's no rush.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.502
Yeah, I mean, you know,

47:19.504 --> 47:21.504
finish your coffee
and then give us an answer.

47:21.506 --> 47:24.040
Might need more time than that,
but how about this,

47:24.042 --> 47:27.276
I promise that I will give it
a lot of thought,

47:27.278 --> 47:29.478
and I'll consider it,
and I'll ask if I have any

47:29.480 --> 47:31.113
- other questions about it.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

47:31.115 --> 47:33.115
- And, um...
<i>- Great.</i>

47:33.117 --> 47:34.417
We'll, then
it's out there and...

47:34.419 --> 47:36.052
<i>Uh-hmm.</i>
Yeah.

47:36.054 --> 47:38.421
- Let's move on, shall we?
<i>- Okay.</i>

47:38.423 --> 47:41.224
<i>His name was Arnie
"rimshot" Roberts.</i>

47:41.226 --> 47:43.492
So, anyway, he wanted it to say,

47:43.494 --> 47:45.561
"never a gentle man."

47:45.563 --> 47:48.297
So, this poor guy's got a typo
on his tombstone

47:48.299 --> 47:50.600
for all of eternity
because, uh...

47:50.602 --> 47:52.201
Hey, how's it going?

47:52.203 --> 47:53.336
Hi. Good.

47:53.338 --> 47:56.505
Oh. Somebody smells good.

47:56.507 --> 47:59.008
Who is it?
Come here.

48:02.212 --> 48:04.080
All right, next round on me.
Drinks for everyone.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.514
- So, Henry.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

48:05.516 --> 48:06.649
Do you have a girlfriend?

48:06.651 --> 48:08.484
I don't.

48:08.486 --> 48:11.254
I did for a couple of years.
But it's hard, you know,

48:11.256 --> 48:13.289
with all the road work
and everything.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.057
- I don't know how you do it.
<i>- Dude, you know what?</i>

48:15.059 --> 48:16.592
There's this girl
in my acting class called Hanna.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.127
You would love her,
I should introduce you.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.595
Sure.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.163
- How about I do it right now?
<i>- No.</i>

48:21.165 --> 48:22.632
No, no, I'm gonna ask her
to come down.

48:22.634 --> 48:24.133
I'm not even dressed up.
Yeah, you look right.

48:24.135 --> 48:25.635
What are you worried about?
Come on.

48:25.637 --> 48:27.036
I'm wearing a Jersey.
Okay. I... it's ringing.

48:27.038 --> 48:29.038
It doesn't matter.
Come on.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.539
Hi, Hanna.

48:30.541 --> 48:33.109
What are you up to tonight?

48:33.111 --> 48:34.944
<i>Great. Well, why don't you come</i>

48:34.946 --> 48:36.586
<i>down at stupid Joe's
and meet my friend?</i>

48:38.548 --> 48:42.084
Uh, I would say he's in his 40s,

48:42.086 --> 48:43.586
<i>40-ish.</i>

48:43.588 --> 48:46.422
Uh, blonde type hair.

48:48.158 --> 48:50.126
Uh, comedian.

48:50.128 --> 48:51.294
- But he does music.
<i>- And he also does music</i>

48:51.296 --> 48:52.962
<i>as well. He's...</i>

48:52.964 --> 48:54.030
<i>Well, half comedian,
half musician.</i>

48:54.032 --> 48:56.265
<i>So, he does both.</i>

48:56.267 --> 48:57.700
Oh.

49:00.003 --> 49:02.004
Okay. All right then.

49:02.006 --> 49:03.572
Well, feel better.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.041
Okay. Bye-bye.

49:06.577 --> 49:08.144
<i>Yeah.
She's not feeling good.</i>

49:08.146 --> 49:10.947
Let's not do that again.

49:23.961 --> 49:27.029
Guys, I'm gonna go to the, um,

49:27.031 --> 49:28.397
just go to the bar.
Yeah.

49:28.399 --> 49:30.666
Come on, man.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.443
Hey, can I, uh, get one more?

49:40.445 --> 49:42.378
Yeah.

49:44.014 --> 49:45.247
Thanks.
For you.

49:45.249 --> 49:48.217
Thank you.

49:48.219 --> 49:50.453
So, are you from la
originally or?

49:50.455 --> 49:53.389
No, I'm from Iowa actually.

49:53.391 --> 49:55.257
Oh, what part of Iowa?

49:55.259 --> 49:56.392
It's a small town.

49:56.394 --> 49:57.727
You've never heard of it.

49:57.729 --> 49:59.228
Try me.

49:59.230 --> 50:01.197
Okay. Burlington.

50:01.199 --> 50:02.999
Burlington. Yeah.
Right by the river there,

50:03.001 --> 50:04.300
south of Bettendorf
and all of that.

50:04.302 --> 50:05.735
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

50:05.737 --> 50:07.536
Have you heard of chopper's
billiards there?

50:07.538 --> 50:09.638
Yeah. I worked there
in high school.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.140
Oh, weird.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.009
Wow. How do you
know Burlington?

50:13.011 --> 50:14.377
I travel for a living.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.345
Okay.

50:17.314 --> 50:19.648
So, are you single or, uh...

50:19.650 --> 50:22.385
I am. Yeah, uh,
just recently actually.

50:22.387 --> 50:24.687
- Just recently? Okay.
- Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.

50:24.689 --> 50:27.490
Seeing this guy and I just...
I had to break things off.

50:27.492 --> 50:29.425
Oh, why is that?

50:29.427 --> 50:31.093
He traveled for a living.

50:31.095 --> 50:32.762
Oh.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.730
You know, we're closing
in like 10 minute, so...

50:34.732 --> 50:36.399
Okay.
If you could just finish up.

50:36.401 --> 50:39.101
Thank you.
No problem.

50:39.103 --> 50:41.203
Hey, guys.

50:59.189 --> 51:01.690
Hey, Jillian.

51:01.692 --> 51:04.226
Um, I wanted to call
and say that, uh,

51:04.228 --> 51:05.461
I was thinking
about what you guys

51:05.463 --> 51:07.329
were saying earlier.

51:07.331 --> 51:09.131
And, um,

51:09.133 --> 51:11.500
I've always wanted
to be there for you,

51:11.502 --> 51:13.536
and I know
what you're going through,

51:13.538 --> 51:16.472
and I just have
thought about it,

51:16.474 --> 51:19.442
and I wanted to say that, um,

51:19.444 --> 51:21.077
I'll do it.

51:21.079 --> 51:23.412
Uh, I'll have sex with Zoe.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.485
I mean, tonight.

51:29.487 --> 51:31.754
<i>Owls can rotate
their heads and necks</i>

51:31.756 --> 51:35.458
<i>as much as 270 degrees.</i>

51:35.460 --> 51:38.461
So, I just wanna be
a hundred percent certain

51:38.463 --> 51:41.097
that you guys
are totally fine with this.

51:41.099 --> 51:42.531
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.266
And she's fine with it?
Yup, yeah.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.334
Okay.
That's fine, it's fine.

51:45.336 --> 51:47.169
All right.

51:47.171 --> 51:48.370
Okay?
Okay.

51:48.372 --> 51:49.672
Okay. Great.
Yeah, let's...

51:49.674 --> 51:50.739
Let's have sex.

51:50.741 --> 51:53.175
Yeah.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.547
Here. Um, oh, yeah.

51:58.549 --> 52:01.183
Let me.

52:05.155 --> 52:06.622
Okay.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.492
Um...

52:10.694 --> 52:13.129
This.
Yeah.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.630
Okay.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.365
All right.
Okay.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.134
Is this fine? Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

52:18.136 --> 52:21.137
And do you want me
to do anything or.

52:21.139 --> 52:23.372
Uh, just... it's fine.
Whatever.

52:23.374 --> 52:25.508
Okay.

52:30.413 --> 52:32.314
And thanks again.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.783
Oh, yeah, no problem.

52:36.653 --> 52:40.222
<i>Unite in a very large
anastomosis or junction.</i>

52:41.758 --> 52:42.892
Okay.
I think it's.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.827
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.396
<i>I think it's ready.</i>

52:47.398 --> 52:49.365
Great.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.240
- Oh.
<i>- Oh.</i>

52:58.242 --> 53:00.242
<i>- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?</i>

53:00.244 --> 53:02.211
<i>Shit.</i>

53:02.213 --> 53:04.914
I'm sorry.
I, um,

53:04.916 --> 53:06.215
I might have fucked up.

53:06.217 --> 53:07.449
What just happened?

53:07.451 --> 53:09.418
I, uh...

53:10.453 --> 53:13.389
What?
Um, I pulled out.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.924
Are you serious?

53:14.926 --> 53:16.525
<i>Yeah, I think it was, like,</i>

53:16.527 --> 53:18.294
an instinctive thing.
Oh, my god.

53:18.296 --> 53:21.230
I'm sorry.
Unbelievable.

53:21.232 --> 53:22.498
What's going on in here?

53:22.500 --> 53:25.234
Um, it's just, uh.

53:25.236 --> 53:26.569
He pulled out.

53:26.571 --> 53:27.703
What does that even mean?

53:27.705 --> 53:29.305
He pulled it out.

53:29.307 --> 53:30.839
Well, can't you
just put it back in?

53:30.841 --> 53:32.508
I... uh, it's too late.

53:32.510 --> 53:33.976
Too late for what?

53:33.978 --> 53:35.711
Are we on a time crunch
or something?

53:35.713 --> 53:37.513
- We basically just had sex.
<i>- So awful.</i>

53:37.515 --> 53:39.348
<i>Like it was a complete waste.</i>

53:39.350 --> 53:41.317
<i>Jerk.</i>
I'm so sorry.

53:41.319 --> 53:44.587
I just... maybe I'm just used
to doing that or something.

53:44.589 --> 53:46.455
I guess, I just wasn't thinking,

53:46.457 --> 53:47.990
um, but I mean,

53:47.992 --> 53:49.825
I could try it again
like in the morning.

53:49.827 --> 53:51.894
No, we're not trying this
again in the morning.

53:51.896 --> 53:52.962
Well.

53:52.964 --> 53:54.897
Gross.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.515
You're listening
to Sharon Levine

54:13.517 --> 54:15.017
and you're listening
to mouth fuck

54:15.019 --> 54:17.953
and I am here with comedian,
Henry Phillips.

54:17.955 --> 54:20.823
Henry, you are, um,

54:20.825 --> 54:22.324
in this area why?

54:22.326 --> 54:23.692
<i>Why are you up?</i>

54:23.694 --> 54:24.860
I'm doing a little bit
of a tour,

54:24.862 --> 54:26.662
a mini tour if you will.

54:26.664 --> 54:27.896
<i>As a matter of fact,
actually tomorrow,</i>

54:27.898 --> 54:29.598
<i>I'm gonna be in northern Nevada</i>

54:29.600 --> 54:31.734
at a place called the nugget.

54:31.736 --> 54:33.636
<i>It's in, uh, Carson city.</i>

54:33.638 --> 54:36.572
Check out
Henry Phillips tomorrow

54:36.574 --> 54:37.906
at the golden nugget
and I love...

54:37.908 --> 54:40.509
No, it's, uh, just the nugget.

54:40.511 --> 54:41.710
<i>I guess,
it's like the golden nugget,</i>

54:41.712 --> 54:43.545
<i>but without all the glitz.</i>

54:43.547 --> 54:44.980
It's a place called the nugget
that's not a part

54:44.982 --> 54:46.815
<i>yeah.</i>
Of the golden nugget?

54:46.817 --> 54:48.651
I don't think
it's even remotely related.

54:48.653 --> 54:50.052
I think it's just this place.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.654
I don't know.
My manager set it up

54:51.656 --> 54:55.524
and she is my manager
extraordinaire.

54:55.526 --> 54:58.761
<i>It's pretty typical of a lot
of the gigs that I do.</i>

54:58.763 --> 55:01.797
Like, uh, instead
of the Madison square garden,

55:01.799 --> 55:03.999
I play at a place
called the square garden.

55:13.843 --> 55:15.744
Hi. I'm performing tonight.

55:15.746 --> 55:17.946
Um, do the performers
get a discount

55:17.948 --> 55:19.515
on drinks by any chance?

55:19.517 --> 55:20.683
Hey, Jack.
It's another comedian

55:20.685 --> 55:22.451
trying to mooch free drinks.

55:22.453 --> 55:24.553
Well, no, I was, uh...
No free drinks, buddy.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.854
But you can get a discount.

55:25.856 --> 55:27.489
That's all right.

55:27.491 --> 55:28.991
Well, I'll take
a Heineken then... thanks.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.059
<i>Got it.</i>
Also, who do I talk to

55:30.061 --> 55:31.627
about sound check?

55:31.629 --> 55:33.896
Go talk to ed right over there.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.634
Hey, how's it going, ed?
Yes, sir.

55:38.636 --> 55:41.503
Yeah, I just need
to plug in a guitar.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.839
No. We don't have
a guitar here.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.607
Oh, no.
I've got my own guitar.

55:45.609 --> 55:47.343
I just need a place
where I can plug it in.

55:47.345 --> 55:48.544
Do you have, like,
a quarter inch input on

55:48.546 --> 55:49.812
the stage somewhere or, uh...

55:49.814 --> 55:52.848
No. No, we're not
set up that way.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.683
Well, what do people do
when they need to plug in

55:54.685 --> 55:56.752
their instruments
when they're doing music here?

55:56.754 --> 55:59.755
The musicians come
with their own equipment.

55:59.757 --> 56:01.357
You're a stand-up
comedian though, right?

56:01.359 --> 56:02.825
Yeah.
Just do it

56:02.827 --> 56:04.927
without the guitar then.

56:04.929 --> 56:06.595
I can't do it
without the guitar.

56:06.597 --> 56:08.464
I sing songs
and I play the guitar.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.998
That's my whole act.
And you're coming to me

56:10.000 --> 56:11.533
two hours before the show

56:11.535 --> 56:14.370
with technical issues?

56:14.372 --> 56:16.772
I could get another mic,
but I've only got one

56:16.774 --> 56:19.475
long cord and the console

56:19.477 --> 56:22.444
is way up there and, I mean,

56:22.446 --> 56:24.546
we only have two hours.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.849
Well, we got to figure
something out, man.

56:26.851 --> 56:29.485
All right.

56:29.487 --> 56:31.487
Look, you fucked up.

56:31.489 --> 56:33.021
<i>Um, I think
I got an idea though.</i>

56:33.023 --> 56:35.491
Here, come here.

56:36.493 --> 56:38.060
All right.

56:38.062 --> 56:41.630
Here's what I'm gonna have you
go ahead and do.

56:41.632 --> 56:44.400
You find the end of that cable.

56:44.402 --> 56:47.136
I will find the end
of this cable.

56:47.138 --> 56:49.738
<i>If I hook them together,</i>

56:49.740 --> 56:52.941
we will end up with one cable

56:52.943 --> 56:54.410
that is long enough

56:54.412 --> 56:56.612
to reach the...

56:56.614 --> 56:58.480
Console.

56:58.482 --> 56:59.915
Dammit.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.652
Hey, you guys
having a good time tonight?

57:03.654 --> 57:05.854
Sorry. We have a little bit
of a technical issue.

57:05.856 --> 57:08.590
That's why I have to kind of...

57:08.592 --> 57:10.058
Anyway, this is a song
for my dog

57:10.060 --> 57:11.994
and, uh, I hope you enjoy it.

58:14.625 --> 58:15.757
And this is gonna be
your part, guys.

58:15.759 --> 58:17.192
You're gonna go...

58:19.597 --> 58:21.530
Let's try that.
Three, four...

58:24.668 --> 58:26.602
It's creepy as he'll,
but I like it.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.031
Three, four.

59:09.178 --> 59:10.279
I'm good, man. Thanks.

59:10.281 --> 59:11.680
Take it, man.

59:11.682 --> 59:13.115
I'll save it for later.

59:13.117 --> 59:15.017
<i>Okay.</i>
You guys giving me a...

59:15.019 --> 59:17.553
Well, you're crazy.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.790
Oh, this is... ah.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.292
Is this lit?

59:23.294 --> 59:26.295
God, it's...

59:39.909 --> 59:41.743
Hello. How may I help you?
Hi, there.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.211
Uh, it's Henry Phillips.

59:43.213 --> 59:45.213
Okay.

59:49.152 --> 59:52.154
Um, okay.

59:52.156 --> 59:54.823
I'm not finding
that reservation.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.291
Of course, you're not.

59:56.293 --> 59:59.227
Um, let's see, you're sure...
It's two ls?

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.229
Yeah.
Okay.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.699
Let's check again.

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.767
I'm the entertainment tonight
at the fantasy lounge,

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.804
so maybe they put it
under fantasy lounge?

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:09.871
Okay.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:12.941
Um, yeah, well,

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.309
we do have a room that's under

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.112
the fantasy lounge, but, um,

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:20.782
it's under someone named
funny guitar boy.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.684
Okay. Yeah.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.086
I'll take a wild stab at it

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:25.787
and say they're talking
about me.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.890
So, I'm sorry.
I have to perform at 8:00,

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.959
and I need to take a nap,

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.362
and shower, and stuff,
so if you don't mind,

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.964
I'd like to get checked in.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.300
Okay. Okay.
So, you're funny guitar boy.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.268
Usually, you need
to have your full...

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.005
I know.
Name, but that's okay.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.662
<i>So, how many hits on that video?</i>

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.130
Just over 11,000 views.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.165
Wow. That's great.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.901
Well, actually, we were hoping
for it to do a little better.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.403
We tried everything.
We growled it out

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.171
to our hundred
thousand friendlings.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.674
We had it featured
on the front page of chumpster

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.742
and the appreciate
to connect to share ratio

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.145
is nowhere near what we had
for even the outtakes

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.346
<i>on an idiot dad.</i>

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.048
Yeah, but aren't people buying

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.382
their friendlings
on chumpster nowadays?

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:28.850
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:29.818
We've already accounted
for that.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.986
Yeah, listen.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.421
Here are your friendlings here.

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:34.056
<i>Now, for every hundred of these,</i>

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:35.857
<i>30 are verified.
That's good.</i>

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.326
Now 28, ironic, that's not good.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:39.961
Forty are us.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:41.763
That looks good,
that's not good.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:43.031
Well, why don't we have
a big show

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.266
and invite these people?

01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:45.734
<i>Well, unfortunately, Ellen,</i>

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.036
these are not actual
human beings,

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.771
you know,
who will like go places.

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:52.774
They're just computer clicks.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.880
Hi.
Hi.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.282
I should have a reservation.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:01.783
Okay.
What's the name?

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:04.419
Funny guitar boy.

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.321
So, what'd they say?

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.824
<i>Well, it didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.</i>

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:11.193
<i>I mean, it's all
about Internet numbers.</i>

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:13.729
You had 11,000 people
watching your song,

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:16.264
but that wasn't enough for Mara
and her whiz kids.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.233
Yeah, I kind of figured as much.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.368
<i>I mean, 11,000 people, Henry.</i>

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.270
I mean,
you could fill a stadium.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.905
Yeah. But it's all relative,
I mean,

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.807
- they need a viral hit.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.409
That's all they talked about,
friendlings,

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.877
and connect to favorites,

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:31.079
and buddies, and pals.
I mean,

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.881
<i>Jay had to translate
the whole thing for me.</i>

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.984
Hold on.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.386
There's somebody at my door.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.821
Yeah.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.157
Um, we have a problem.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.993
This gentleman
is supposed to be in this room

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:46.995
and we don't have
a reservation for you,

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:48.997
so I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.332
Who is this?

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:52.534
I'm funny guitar boy.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.369
<i>Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.</i>

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:56.972
You guys have been amazing.
Please follow me on Twitter

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.874
and vine and friendling me
on chumster.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.343
Also, I have bumper stickers
out back that say,

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.178
"my penis."
Now, I wanna introduce

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.980
my new friend.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.315
Feels like an old friend,
Mr. Henry Phillips.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.353
- Thanks.
<i>- It's all right, man.</i>

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:14.022
Hey, thanks, everybody.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.957
And give it up again
for funny guitar boy.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.827
He was hilarious.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:21.029
And a nice guy, too.
He's letting me crash

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:22.964
<i>to his hotel room tonight</i>

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.333
because apparently
my manager smokes crack.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:28.837
Oh, I'm supposed
to tell you guys this

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:31.273
from the management
here at the fantasy lounge,

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.542
this is not actually a show.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.178
Um, it's just that
everybody has died

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.346
and gone to hell.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.115
Sorry about that.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.283
But anyway, this is a song
about growing up.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.885
And I hope you enjoy it.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.204
<i>Hey, man, I'm really excited</i>

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:37.272
<i>that we get to do
the show together.</i>

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:38.473
I, uh,

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.941
I'm a big fan back in college.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.309
My buddy, he burned
your Cd for me

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.945
and it was inspiring for me.

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:46.581
Thanks, man.
Yeah, I think

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.350
they're gonna
have you back here.

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:49.985
You had a really good set.

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:51.152
Well, you know,

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.487
I mean, this isn't,

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.189
you know, really what
I wanna be doing

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:55.924
exactly, you know?

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:57.325
What do you wanna be doing?

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.227
Michael, by the time I'm 30,

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.496
I wanna be headlining
a clubs only.

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:03.164
You know what I mean?
Big cities.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.367
New York, Chicago,
San Francisco, Orlando.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:07.402
By the time I'm 35,

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.005
<i>hell, man, I'll be doing
theaters, TV show.</i>

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.973
Well, it sounds like
you got it all mapped out.

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:13.141
<i>Oh, I tell
you, you got to do it.</i>

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:14.542
In this business, oh my god,

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.044
set goals, achieve the goals.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.979
So many people just drift.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:19.514
They just

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.316
drift off into nothing.

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:23.318
I'll tell you one thing,
I don't wanna be in my 40s

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.986
paying shitty rooms like this
for a hundred bucks a night.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.589
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:30.091
Yeah.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.199
<i>Gray.</i>

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:42.570
<i>Haven.</i>

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.944
<i>Gray.</i>

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:55.550
<i>Haven.</i>

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.088
<i>Gray.</i>

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:02.724
Front desk, this is Danielle.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.392
<i>Yeah, um,</i>

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.994
there's somebody
making all kinds of racket

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:07.495
in the hallway right now.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:08.630
<i>- Haven.
- Oh, I'm sorry</i>

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:09.998
<i>about that, sir.</i>

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.433
<i>Um, what are they doing?</i>

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:14.569
Uh, just like, uh,

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.204
just yelling, and screaming,

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.073
and banging
on the walls and shit.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.441
What are they yelling?

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:20.508
<i>Um,</i>

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.143
gray haven

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.611
<i>or something.</i>
What?

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.448
Uh, sounds like
they're saying gray haven.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:27.983
She's saying, uh...

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.284
Could spell that?

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:31.553
H-I... h-a-v... I don't know.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:33.021
Who cares how
you spell it? Can you...

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:34.422
Is there a way you can make them

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:35.623
stop doing it?
Yeah. Oh, you know what,

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:36.558
could you hold on one second?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.693
I'm so sorry.

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:41.363
- Front desk, this is Danielle.
<i>- Yeah, it's still me.</i>

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.098
<i>I'm so sorry.
Hold on one second.</i>

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.299
<i>Front desk, this is Danielle.</i>

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.367
Still me.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:46.434
<i>Haven.</i>

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:48.703
Lady, shut the fuck up.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.707
You know what,
I can send somebody up there

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.376
<i>and see if they can do...</i>
Uh, you know what,

01:06:54.378 --> 01:06:55.677
actually, I think
it's been taken care of.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:57.212
Well, I'm very sorry

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.214
for the inconvenience.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.117
Thanks, man.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.390
Matt, Matt.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:10.191
Come here, look at this.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.660
<i>Awesome.</i>

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.262
<i>Oh, you're crazy.</i>

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.431
<i>Uh, uh, got it.</i>

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:17.499
<i>This is lit.</i>

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.600
Oh, shit.

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:38.119
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.256
Can I get a cup of coffee

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:42.390
to go, please?

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.259
Right on.

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.732
Hey, uh,

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.834
you have a video
on the Internet right now.

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:54.536
I actually do, yeah.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.371
- I knew that was you.
<i>- Really?</i>

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.772
Oh, it was so funny.

01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:59.374
- You've seen it?
<i>- Yeah, I've seen it</i>

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:00.642
<i>- over and over.</i>
- Uh, I've seen

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.143
your video, too.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.645
I showed it to everybody.

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:05.113
Well, that's great.
Well, what do I owe you

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:07.382
for the, uh...
Oh, um, have it.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:09.117
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.385
- Okay.
- Uh,

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:11.519
be careful with that.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.392
I was, uh, talking about how...

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.160
You were talking about
the beauty of what you do.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.763
Yeah, yeah,
and just how amazing it is

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:25.366
that I can make so many people

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:27.469
so happy, you know?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.537
<i>It's just...</i>
But it's true.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.115
Ow.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:46.654
<i>Front desk.</i>

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.490
Hello. Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:51.259
I'm having a problem
with flies in my room.

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:52.527
<i>You have what problem?</i>

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.895
Like, flies.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.529
There's a whole
infestation of them.

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.232
They're buzzing around and shit.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:58.600
<i>Flies, flies in room?</i>

01:08:58.602 --> 01:09:00.435
Yeah. Can we do something?

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:01.736
<i>What room number?</i>

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.805
- 125.
<i>- I send someone.</i>

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.640
<i>He take care of it.</i>
Thank you.

<i>Today, 10:02 am.</i>

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.756
<i>Henry, I have
your check from the network.</i>

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:24.559
<i>They took out a lot
of taxes, but still.</i>

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560
<i>Anyway, come by my place anytime</i>

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:27.629
<i>and bring your checkbook.</i>

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:30.398
<i>I want my cut in this.</i>

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.466
<i>Today, 10:26 am.</i>

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:33.734
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phillips,</i>

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:35.636
<i>detective Delgado here.</i>

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:38.673
<i>Well, good news,
we found your 2006 Forenza.</i>

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:39.874
<i>It was not stolen.</i>

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:40.942
<i>It looks like the vehicle</i>

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.377
<i>was actually towed</i>

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:45.246
<i>for obstructing a driveway.</i>

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.781
<i>It's gonna be a hundred
and seven dollars</i>

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:48.683
<i>for the towing,
plus an additional</i>

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.286
<i>one hundred dollars
for each day in storage.</i>

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:54.189
<i>Have a nice day.
Congratulations.</i>

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:56.191
<i>Message saved.</i>

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.265
This is Delgado.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:05.800
Yeah. It's Henry Phillips
calling about my car.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.535
Yes, Mr. Phillips,

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.370
2006 Forenza.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.505
You can pick up your vehicle

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:12.840
at 2309 west temple.

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:15.577
Okay. Well, but what
I was thinking is, like,

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:18.746
I shouldn't have to pay
the $2,000 fee if, uh,

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.682
<i>it's technically
not my fault, right?</i>

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:22.417
It's not your fault
you obstructed

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:25.220
- someone else's driveway?
<i>- Well,</i>

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:27.522
no, I'm not denying that part.
I'll take your word for it.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:28.790
But that's beside the point.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:29.924
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.226
Nobody ever told me

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.961
that my car was stolen.

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.929
Hold on a second.
What is this shit?

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:41.769
Yeah. Thanks.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.672
You know what I mean?
It's, like,

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.507
if somebody had told me

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:48.309
that my car was impounded,

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.978
then I would have picked
it up that day, you know?

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.246
<i>Okay.</i>

01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:52.614
I mean, you can fight it

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:53.948
with the adjudicator.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:55.516
<i>But I wouldn't recommend it</i>

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:56.851
<i>considering that every day</i>

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.586
<i>that your car is in storage,</i>

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.722
you're gonna be
incurring higher fees.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:04.325
All right. Well, I think I have
a pretty strong case here, so,

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:06.928
<i>can we set up,
uh, an adjudicator meeting?</i>

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.696
Yes, sir, I will set up

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.465
your adjudicator meeting.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:11.966
Thank you.

01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:18.439
All right.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.710
Oh, yeah, let me, uh,
I can cut you a check.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:24.612
Yeah. Well, come
into my office.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.447
Here, would like some coffee?

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.615
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:28.850
How do you take your coffee?

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:30.918
Uh, just black.
Oh, that's easy.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.720
So, isn't this exciting, Henry?

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:33.788
Yeah.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.992
<i>Oh, I'm gonna let
the machine get it.</i>

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:40.962
<i>Hi, this is Ellen</i>

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.497
<i>from Ellen Pinsky management.</i>

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:45.700
<i>I'll get back to you asap.</i>

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.068
<i>Hey, Ellen, it's Jay Warren.</i>

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.671
<i>Um, you know...</i>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:51.406
Uh, um, hi, Jay.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:52.907
<i>Oh. Oh, you're there.</i>

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.575
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.
- Great.</i>

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:56.311
<i>In fact, I'm screening my calls,</i>

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.578
but I'm actually here
with Henry right now

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.846
and I just gave him his check.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.615
<i>Uh, yeah, that's great.</i>

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:02.317
<i>Listen, are you guys
able to make it</i>

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:03.584
<i>to</i> now channel
<i>today at 2:00 P.M.</i>

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:05.320
<i>Which I know is short notice,</i>

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.487
<i>but they wanna see us
right away.</i>

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.890
Uh, sure. Is it something good?

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.692
<i>Let's just say
I've never heard of a network</i>

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:11.893
<i>calling an emergency
meeting like this</i>

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.328
<i>to tell somebody no.</i>

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.363
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.333
<i>Hold up.
Hold up. Hold the door.</i>

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.534
Okay. Okay.
Got it.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:20.835
Oh, thanks.
Oh, hey.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:21.903
Oh, hey.

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:24.439
Oh, hey. Hi.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:25.807
<i>Have you heard the good news?</i>

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.675
No. Clue us in.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.977
Uh, well, your video went viral.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.346
Oh, you're kidding.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.114
Wow.

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:36.651
<i>Those whiz kids
really came through, huh?</i>

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.353
<i>I'll tell you what,
I'll save it for later.</i>

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:39.854
<i>- Awesome.
- Yeah.</i>

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.622
<i>Crazy.</i>

01:12:41.624 --> 01:12:43.458
<i>What?</i>

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.827
<i>- Oh.
- This is lit.</i>

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:50.932
Wait, so this is
the video you guys

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.467
- are talking about?
<i>- It... it's got</i>

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.634
<i>the three steps of virality.</i>

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:54.936
Step one, the join.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.003
Get your hand on the mouse.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.839
<i>Step two, the fuck up,</i>

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.540
moves the mouse over
to the share button.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.043
Step three, the epic
face-plant, fires the click.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.644
<i>It's a fucking masterpiece.</i>

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:05.113
<i>Guys, this is really good.</i>

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:06.981
We're ready to take this
to the next level.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.649
We have one little tweak.
Mara, why don't you

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:10.017
<i>tell them about it?</i>
All right. So what

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:11.419
we're gonna do
is we're gonna take

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:13.654
the day's hottest viral videos

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.523
and then we're going to have

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:17.925
famous actors reenact them,

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:20.561
<i>but who better to introduce them</i>

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.797
<i>than Mr. epic fail himself,</i>

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:23.965
<i>Henry Phillips?</i>

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:25.867
So Henry, you would come out

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:28.136
and you do like a little bit
and maybe a stunt

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.537
<i>where you trip and fall over.</i>
Wait, wait, uh, hold on.

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:31.072
So, I'm the host of this show

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.540
doing my songs and having...

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.475
Dude, fuck your songs.

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:36.043
This is what people
wanna see you doing.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:37.445
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, like no offense,

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:38.546
but when we uploaded your song,

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:39.847
the response was garbage,

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.048
like it was like
trying to give away

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.483
an old mattress or something.

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:43.785
<i>Uh, we love your songs</i>

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:45.620
and we think they're so silly,

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.155
<i>but I think
that we can all agree</i>

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:49.056
<i>that they're not testing
very well</i>

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.459
<i>in the viral universe.
So, we just really wanted</i>

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:54.028
<i>to take advantage of this
really remarkable opportunity.</i>

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.764
People are doing
parodies of your video.

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.641
<i>Look, that's the thing though,</i>

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.075
it's not my video.

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:09.644
Not...
- no, this is your video,

01:14:09.646 --> 01:14:10.878
this is your face.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.513
People are recognizing you.

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:13.815
<i>They're talking about you.</i>
Yeah.

01:14:13.817 --> 01:14:14.782
Well, they aren't
talking about me.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.050
Here's a guy

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:18.953
who calls me a douche canoe.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.488
<i>I don't even know
what that means.</i>

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:21.689
<i>All right, here's a good one.</i>

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:24.525
I'm a shit-eating
twat waffle.

01:14:24.527 --> 01:14:25.693
I do know what that means

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.161
<i>and it's not flattering.</i>

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:28.696
<i>You got to get over it, man.</i>

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.198
Negative comments
are how you know

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.599
- you're a somebody.
<i>- If everyone</i>

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:32.834
<i>was being nice, that means</i>

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:34.235
<i>they don't see you as a threat.</i>

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:35.636
- This is a compliment.
<i>- Oh, yeah,</i>

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:36.871
<i>it's a compliment. Okay, well,</i>

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:38.506
<i>I'm gonna compliment you, guys,</i>

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:40.208
and say that you're
a couple of, uh,

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.043
ass-gobbling cunt balloons.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.578
<i>Nothing's set in stone, okay?</i>

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.745
I mean, this is just
spitballing here.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:45.980
Henry, how about this?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.114
We're gonna get you some water,

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.483
we'll get you some coffee,

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:49.917
I'm just sensing you're maybe

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.686
getting a little upset.
I'm extremely upset.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:52.987
As a matter of fact,
I don't wanna have anything

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.109
to do with any of this shit.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.995
Well, I think
he feels like he, kind of,

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.730
got blindsided,
you know? And it's,

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:04.499
uh, it's an adjustment.
We'll work it up.

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:05.700
Ellen, we'll talk to him

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:06.934
and we'll be good.

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.937
Fuck your songs?
You kidding me?

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.943
<i>I know this is not
what you originally envisioned,</i>

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.712
<i>what any of us
originally envisioned,</i>

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.547
but this is just the way things

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:21.215
shake out sometimes.
I mean, this is...

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.017
This is an opportunity,
this is serendipity.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.285
Well I mean, the thing is,

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.020
my songs are my life, you know.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.022
- That's what I enjoy doing.
<i>- I know.</i>

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.590
I get that, I do,
and I love them,

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.826
but here's what I think
you're missing.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.594
If this show was a hit,

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:34.896
you can write
all the songs you want.

01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:36.230
I mean, you're gonna be famous.

01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:37.899
<i>That's what you want, right?</i>

01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:39.534
I never said that.

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.035
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.838
Hey, Henry, I just saw
that viral video of yours.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.673
<i>Is that, uh, what the TV show
is all about?</i>

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:46.774
Well, it's not what
it was supposed to be about,

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:48.309
but apparently it is.

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.944
<i>Well, it was funny as hell</i>

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:51.579
and you got tons
of views. Congrats.

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:52.947
Yeah, but it's
unintentionally funny.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.715
Unintentional?
The... what does that...

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.317
Do you know... you know
who Arnie Roberts is?

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:57.885
- There you go. Rimshot.
- Oh, yeah, tombstone guy.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.086
Arnie "rimshot" Roberts.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:00.755
You know what he used to say?

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:01.923
It doesn't matter
why they're laughing

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.658
as long as they're laughing.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.593
Have a good stay.

01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:06.961
<i>Well, listen, why don't we shoot</i>

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.629
for a compromise, like,

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.331
let's say they have you sing
one of your songs

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:12.600
and then on the way out,
you slip on some paint

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.935
or something?
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:15.903
I'm just spitballing
out of my ass.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.672
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, hey.

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:19.640
Your hair is on fire.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.643
See? Like this is
the kind of shit

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:25.079
I
Jay: <i> Yeah, that was ridiculous.</i>

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.248
But do you really have
a choice now at this point?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.016
<i>Well, what do you mean?</i>

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.651
Well, I mean, we signed on

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:32.119
to develop this thing, you know.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:34.021
If you just walk away now,
you're pissing off

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.823
some pretty important people.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:37.191
<i>- This is big business here.
- Henry,</i>

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:38.926
you got to think about this.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.628
All right. Well, look,
I got to go on now,

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.363
but, uh, let's talk
about this another time.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.798
Okay, well, knock them dead

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.132
and don't worry, Henry,

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:46.734
I got your back.
All right.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:47.969
Well, thanks, Ellen.
Thanks, guys.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.770
I'll see you in a little bit.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.906
We got a very
funny guy coming up now.

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:53.774
He just sold the show
to the now channel

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.309
and he's here tonight,
give him a hand,

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:58.346
make him feel welcome,
Mr. Henry Phillips.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.989
Hey, thanks, stupid.

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:10.057
Um...

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.627
Well, I've only been in la now
for a couple of weeks

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:13.794
and it's weird
because I've noticed

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.262
that I think hailing a taxi

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:17.098
must look exactly
the same as trying...

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.033
<i>Do the
light-your-hair-on-fire bit.</i>

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:20.368
- The what?
<i>- The bit,</i>

01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:21.936
where you light
your hair on fire.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:23.104
That's not actually a bit.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.271
She's talking about a video

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:25.339
where, uh, somebody gave me

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.907
a marijuana cigarette

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:27.942
and I hey, man,

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.110
were you really stoned?

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.678
No, I wasn't stoned.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.013
Like I get...
I didn't know it was lit

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:33.147
and I put it on my hair
and I wound up

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.315
damn near killing myself...

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.349
Feeling like you were stoned.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:36.884
If you don't mind,

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.252
I'd rather not do
a whole Q and a

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.688
about this fucking
video right now.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.123
I'd rather just do my act.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.225
That was so funny.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.060
<i>Was it fake?</i>
Okay. Uh, so anyway,

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:48.095
yeah, I've only been
in la for a couple of weeks now

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:50.164
- and, uh, it's funny...
<i>- So why did you come up</i>

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.932
<i>here if you weren't
gonna talk about the...</i>

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.000
All right, dude,
if you wanna talk about it,

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.335
you can talk about it.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:55.369
Everybody just go
fuck themselves.

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.204
I'm done with this shit.

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:00.908
Hey,

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.777
what did I tell you guys
about heckling the performers?

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:04.345
I was just trying to go...
I was trying to

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.113
that's not up to you.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:07.882
<i>Why don't you guys
pretend this is TV</i>

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.383
<i>and shut the fuck up, huh?
You know what?</i>

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:10.951
Get out of here, buddy.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:12.720
Oggy, get this idiot
out of here.

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.221
- I'm a customer.
- Not at my club,

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:15.289
- you're not. Get out.
- That's so unfair.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.991
Oh, you, too, asshole.

01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:18.192
Oggy, this one, too.
It's a little harsh.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.960
<i>So is your makeup.</i>

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.295
We just wanted to see...
Yeah, shut up.

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:22.329
Why don't you guys
go and have sex

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:23.964
in the parking lot?

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:25.032
Thank you, guys,
for being human beings,

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.400
not like those idiots.

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:27.802
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.806
Are you guys

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:34.308
<i>the front end of the vehicle</i>

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.810
<i>was over 20 inches</i>

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:37.712
<i>into a private driveway.</i>

01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:38.979
It's a violation.

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:40.214
It's clear cut.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.016
Mr. Phillips?

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:43.918
Well, yeah, I'm not disputing
that part of it.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.453
I'm just saying
that nobody ever told me

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:47.855
the car was impounded.
You see what I mean?

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.123
So it's like
the cops are looking

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:50.191
for a stolen vehicle

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:51.358
when meanwhile my car

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.127
is sitting on their impound lot

01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:55.296
<i>racking up $2,000
worth of charges...</i>

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:56.997
When did the police contact you

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.365
about finding your car?

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:00.501
I got a message two days ago.

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:02.369
<i>- I see.
- Now, hold on.</i>

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:03.738
When the car was towed,

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.239
I entered it into the system

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.842
so there's absolutely
positively no way

01:19:07.844 --> 01:19:10.211
the police would not
have notified him that day.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:13.013
Mr. Phillips, do you still
have the message?

01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:14.915
I should, yeah.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.283
<i>Can you play it for us?</i>

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:17.952
Sure.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.490
<i>Sunday, September 18, 10:17 am.</i>

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.258
<i>Sorry about last night.</i>

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.159
<i>I wound up banging
that Erica chick.</i>

01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:27.128
Oh, sorry.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:28.329
<i>She's gonna be
the last girl in la</i>

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.030
<i>that still has a hairy crotch.</i>

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:32.867
<i>Shave the cooch,
shave the cooch.</i>

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:35.503
<i>I went down on that...</i>
I'm sorry. Um...

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:38.439
<i>You hang up on me,
you piece of shit coward?</i>

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.007
<i>You little fucking weep...</i>

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.176
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.844
<i>Hey, Henry, I feel bad.</i>

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:44.945
<i>I know we haven't talked</i>

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.147
<i>since you ejaculated</i>

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:47.882
<i>on my girlfriend's leg...</i>

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.283
- Mr. Phillips, it...
<i>- But, um...</i>

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:50.551
- One sec.
<i>- I'd love to talk</i>

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.353
<i>to you or see you.</i>

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:53.854
<i>Message saved,</i>

01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.957
<i>Monday, September 26, 10:26 am.</i>

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:58.392
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phillips,</i>

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.127
<i>detective Delgado here.</i>
This is it.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.195
<i>Well, good news we found</i>

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:03.464
<i>your 2006 Forenza.</i>

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:04.865
<i>It was not stolen.</i>

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.066
<i>It looks like the vehicle</i>

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:07.401
<i>was actually towed</i>

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:10.204
<i>for obstructing a driveway.</i>

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:12.540
<i>You can retrieve it at 2309</i>

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:14.441
<i>- west Tampa boulevard.
- Okay then.</i>

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:18.045
Can you read that
back to me, please?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:22.416
Sunday, September
18th, 10:17 am.

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.051
Hey, sorry about last night.

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.252
I wound up banging
that Erica chick.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:27.888
Just the last message is fine.

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.924
Sorry.

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:32.560
Monday, September 26, 10:26 am.

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:35.029
Good morning, Mr. Phillips,
detective Delgado here.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:38.165
<i>Well, good news we found
your 2006 Forenza.</i>

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:40.067
<i>It wasn't stolen.
It looks like the vehicle</i>

01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:43.304
<i>was towed for obstructing
a driveway.</i>

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:45.105
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.626
<i>So I guess somebody</i>

01:21:05.628 --> 01:21:07.494
<i>uploads this stupid video</i>

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:09.196
of me making
an ass out of myself

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.265
and it turns out
that that's what the network

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:14.034
wanted to make a show
about, not my songs,

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.402
just some asshole

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.304
whose hair caught
on fire, you know,

01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:19.874
so just because of this dumb
viral video, you know?

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:21.876
Yeah, I know.
I saw the video.

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:23.510
It was hilarious.

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:26.013
<i>You saw it?</i>
Yeah. Somebody uploaded it

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:27.248
on Facebook and I was like,

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.049
oh, there's the guy

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.351
that screwed my girlfriend.

01:21:30.353 --> 01:21:31.518
<i>Oh, no.</i>

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.153
I hope Zoe's gonna forgive me

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:34.989
about all that.

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:37.658
I think when she finally
stops vomiting,

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.895
she'll probably come around.

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:43.030
I was gonna put
a fresh pot of coffee on.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:44.198
Would you like some?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.366
<i>I would love that.</i>

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.668
All right. Well, um,

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.470
here comes a little
visitor for you.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:51.105
Aw.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:56.477
Make sure he doesn't
jump off the ledge.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.078
Oh, he's fine.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.414
<i>I was talking to the cat.</i>

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.019
<i>Jay, whatever happened
to your TV show</i>

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.054
<i>about that loser guy?</i>

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.990
Just a little Fyi, uh,

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:11.992
you talking to a guy
in my business,

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:13.427
<i>it's not the best idea to say,</i>

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.229
hey, whatever
happened to your blank,

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:16.931
you know, because
if you didn't hear about it,

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.532
that story is not gonna have
a happy ending.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:21.468
Duly noted.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.304
I owe you one.

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:26.206
I'll take it.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:27.274
I'll tell you what happened.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:28.409
We had Carl Rohmer

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.944
and the whole now network

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:31.312
chopping at the bit
to make a show

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:32.479
about a guy,
we're in the homestretch

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:34.715
and the guy just bails.

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.517
Well, all I can say
is he's damn luck

01:22:36.519 --> 01:22:38.118
he's working with you, Jay,

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.054
not one of those
other sharks out there

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:43.223
or pedaling
hotdogs in Kalamazoo right now.

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:44.391
You know what,
at the end of the day,

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:46.727
I kind of get it. I mean...

01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:48.362
Not everybody is dying
to be famous

01:22:48.364 --> 01:22:50.631
just for the sake
of being famous.

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.266
<i>So pop one open</i>

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.468
<i>for that cool, refreshing taste.</i>

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:01.508
Look at that.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.210
Stupid Joe does make more money

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.579
in 10 seconds than we're
gonna make all weekend.

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:08.182
Well, good for him,
I guess, huh?

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.126
Hey, did you leave
the lights on?

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.427
No, they turn off automatically.

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:22.296
Are you sure?
Yeah.

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.398
Yeah, come on, let's go.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:46.086
Okay. It just didn't.

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:04.271
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:05.539
Yeah.
Is it all right

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.074
if I just drop
this here for a sec?

01:24:07.076 --> 01:24:09.143
Okay.
Thank you.

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:13.347
Hey, what's up man?

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:14.581
Hey, bathroom?

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:15.749
Yeah, but this section is closed

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:17.384
for a private party, sorry.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.053
Uh, is there another
bathroom or...

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:20.554
No.
So,

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.156
what would somebody do
if they have to go

01:24:22.158 --> 01:24:23.657
to the bathroom?
I got some VIPs back here

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:25.192
and I'm gonna tell you, sir.
This is crazy.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.560
I mean, is that even legal?

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:28.262
Don't you have
to have a bathroom

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:30.184
for the people? I mean...
Yeah, I'm not a lawyer.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.500
That's crazy.

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.774
All right.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:42.409
I want in.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:43.777
But you're not getting in.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.680
You know, right now,

01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:48.649
I might be a big nobody here,

01:24:48.651 --> 01:24:50.751
but few years down the line,
I might be selling out shows

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:54.521
all over the country
and our paths may cross again.

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:56.356
And if you're not nice
to me now,

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:58.125
I might not be
so easy to deal with

01:24:58.127 --> 01:24:59.793
a little bit down the line.

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:01.662
So,

01:25:01.664 --> 01:25:03.497
what's it gonna be?

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.408
Bullshit.

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:16.176
Hey, man.
Hey, man, how's it going?

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:17.511
Good, good.

01:25:17.513 --> 01:25:19.213
What do you want
for your introduction?

01:25:19.215 --> 01:25:21.515
Oh, just say Henry Phillips.

01:25:21.517 --> 01:25:23.183
Cool. You want me
to tell them

01:25:23.185 --> 01:25:25.319
to turn off their cell phones?

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:27.621
Yeah, if you want.

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.656
I got it. All right.
Cool.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:31.225
Hey, can I have a glass
of water real quick?

01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:32.559
Oh, thanks.

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.861
<i>Hey.</i>
Well, hey, man,

01:25:33.863 --> 01:25:36.130
where did you go?
Bathroom.

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:38.132
Did that guy let you in?
Yeah,

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.801
I had to tell him
I was with Henry Phillips.

01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:43.337
Oh, um, by the way,

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.539
Arnold tell me to tell you...

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:46.707
Hotdogs.

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:48.242
Don't forget to mention hotdogs,

01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:49.710
two for a dollar in a bun.

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.345
Put it in there somewhere.

01:25:51.347 --> 01:25:53.180
<i>- Good deal.
- All right.</i>

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.781
<i>This guy coming up here,
Henry Phillips,</i>

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:59.153
wants you to turn
your cell phones off, okay?

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.888
He came all the way
out here from la.

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:02.523
I expect you
to give him the respect

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:05.726
that somebody from la deserves.

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:07.628
Don't need to be
talking on your cell phones

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.196
like a bunch of jackasses,

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:10.531
<i>so give it up.</i>

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.470
Oh, thanks.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:17.804
You guys having a good time?

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.775
<i>I'm not from la.
I, um, I was just there</i>

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:23.510
for a little while though.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.345
I think la is this place
where everybody feels

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:26.947
like they're just like sleeping
their way to the top

01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:28.549
and I always felt
like I'm just like

01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:29.816
masturbating my way
to the bottom

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:31.852
for no other reason. And, um...

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:33.820
But I've always had the worst,
like, when it comes to meeting

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.455
new people for the first time,
and this is a true story.

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:37.624
I was in the elevator recently

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:39.426
<i>and there were a couple
of girls there</i>

01:26:39.428 --> 01:26:41.495
<i>and some other people
and I was trying</i>

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:43.197
<i>to talk to these girls</i>

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.731
<i>and there wasn't
really happening</i>

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:46.433
<i>and so, um,</i>

01:26:46.435 --> 01:26:48.268
when I got to my floor,
I didn't know

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:49.937
if I was supposed
to go right or left,

01:26:49.939 --> 01:26:51.305
but I just wanted to get out
of there so I thought,

01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:52.339
well, I'm just gonna go left

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:53.907
and deal with it later.

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:55.943
<i>So I get to my floor
and I was like,</i>

01:26:55.945 --> 01:26:58.278
<i>well, you guys have
a good one, whatever.</i>

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.314
<i>And then I went out
and I went left,</i>

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:02.683
<i>but there's just
a wall right here</i>

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:04.384
and I was like, oh, shit.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.586
But I didn't think they
could see, so I thought,

01:27:05.588 --> 01:27:07.254
well, maybe what I'll do,

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:08.989
I'm just gonna, kind of,
like stand here

01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:11.592
<i>and hide up against the wall
just for a second</i>

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:12.826
<i>and wait for the doors to close</i>

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:13.961
<i>so that way they don't know</i>

01:27:13.963 --> 01:27:15.629
<i>that I fucked up.</i>

01:27:15.631 --> 01:27:16.997
So, I'm just
kind of standing here,

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:19.399
hiding against
the wall, waiting,

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:21.335
<i>and the doors weren't closing
for the longest time,</i>

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:23.337
<i>but while I was standing there,</i>

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:26.440
<i>I looked across here
and there's this giant mirror</i>

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.408
<i>and I could see them,
and they're staring at me</i>

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.510
and I'm just standing here,
hiding up against this wall,

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:32.879
I didn't know
what to say, I was like, uh,

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:34.715
oh, hey.

01:27:34.717 --> 01:27:36.617
And then the doors closed
right at that moment,

01:27:36.619 --> 01:27:38.352
so that's the last thing
anybody saw

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:39.553
and I was like, oh, man.

01:27:41.523 --> 01:27:43.657
I don't think that happens
to normal people.

01:27:43.659 --> 01:27:45.792
So is it worth it?

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:49.463
As long as I'm doing
what I like to do,

01:27:49.465 --> 01:27:51.632
you know, I think that if
somebody came up to me and said,

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:54.801
"hey, I'll give you $10,000,

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:56.603
"but you have to say a joke

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:59.773
that you don't think is funny,"

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.875
<i>I would do it, obviously.</i>
Yeah, I would, too.

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:02.943
<i>That was a bad example.</i>

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:04.311
<i>I was stupid.</i>

01:28:04.313 --> 01:28:05.646
What I meant was, um,

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:07.748
like, if you...

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.650
<i>You wanna fail
at doing what you love</i>

01:28:09.652 --> 01:28:12.319
- and not compromising.
<i>- Exactly,</i>

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:14.054
and I think
I'm feeling very well

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:15.422
doing what I love.

01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:16.823
You're listening to mouth fuck.

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:19.393
That was Henry Phillips

01:28:19.395 --> 01:28:21.461
who I believe is...

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.897
A rambling troubadour
extraordinaire.

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:25.499
Oh.

01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:26.800
<i>And, uh, thank you so much</i>

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:29.069
<i>for coming in.</i>

01:28:29.071 --> 01:28:31.038
<i>- Yeah.
- Playing your song</i>

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040
<i>- and talking about your life.
- Sure.</i>

01:28:33.042 --> 01:28:34.541
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

01:30:00.496 --> 01:30:02.095
<i>I wanna apologize
about my voice tonight,</i>

01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:04.398
<i>by the way.</i>

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.832
<i>Every night,
it's a shitty voice,</i>

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:08.902
<i>so I apologize
about that, but...</i>

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:23.083
<i>Thank you guys very much.</i>

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:24.818
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
