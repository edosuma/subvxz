HAKEEM: Previously on Empire...

00:02.470 --> 00:03.671
GISELLE:
Her megachurch made an offer

00:03.771 --> 00:04.872
for a Tiana performance.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.507
No! No!

00:06.607 --> 00:09.377
Wait, she is trending
like crazy.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.612
I wanna introduce you
to Kelly Patel.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.013
The king of Silicon Valley.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.083
He needs no introduction
in this house.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.418
I'm stopping the upcoming
release of Treasure's album.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.121
What you did made Empire
look weak.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.389
If I make waves now,
it's gonna look like

00:21.489 --> 00:22.523
I'm challenging Pop.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.557
It's about changing things.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.592
Something has to change.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.759
You gonna come home now?

00:25.859 --> 00:26.794
Ha-ha!

00:26.894 --> 00:28.962
You want me to come home now,
Lucious?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.365
To the empire!

00:32.100 --> 00:33.634
Hey, Yana.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.872
You came all this way
just to slap me?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.274
Don't flatter yourself.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.642
(dramatic music)

00:41.742 --> 00:45.045
I have gigs lined up
the next few weeks here,

00:45.146 --> 00:46.914
but I could not leave
without letting you know

00:47.014 --> 00:48.782
what I thought
about what you did.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.585
You're entitled to that.
And would you get on with it?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.053
I have other things to do.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.956
Every time you open your mouth,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.626
you let me know
how much pain you're in.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.564
It's almost like every person
that you have ever loved

01:03.664 --> 01:05.733
told you that you were garbage.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.335
That sounds familiar.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.137
*

01:09.237 --> 01:10.338
And you believed it,

01:10.438 --> 01:12.673
and I know that's why
you left me.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.576
I left you because
my kingdom needs me.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.845
Does it need you,

01:17.945 --> 01:19.747
or do you need it?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.649
You've said
what you have to say.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.852
Now say good-bye, Yana.

01:24.952 --> 01:31.825
*

01:42.836 --> 01:44.037
(Summer Walker's
"Girls Need Love")

01:44.138 --> 01:47.541
WALKER: * Honestly,
I'm trying to stay focused *

01:47.641 --> 01:48.876
*

01:48.976 --> 01:52.045
* You must think
I've got to be joking *

01:52.146 --> 01:53.181
* Honestly

01:53.281 --> 01:54.215
(Teri sighs)

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
WALKER:
* I don't think I can wait

01:56.317 --> 01:58.686
* I just need it now

01:58.786 --> 02:01.855
* Better swing my way

02:01.955 --> 02:03.691
(Teri giggles)

02:03.791 --> 02:06.460
Mm, we are gonna miss
mornings like this

02:06.560 --> 02:08.061
when I get back to work.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.863
*

02:09.963 --> 02:11.332
You're going back to work?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.700
(laughs)

02:12.800 --> 02:14.702
Of course I'm going back
to work.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.337
WALKER: * The one, ay

02:16.437 --> 02:18.038
* We could start
with a handshake *

02:18.138 --> 02:19.307
Andre.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.510
*

02:22.610 --> 02:25.379
I have a master's degree
in nursing.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.482
I love my job.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.651
I'm sorry, baby.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.221
It's just, um--I--I didn't know

02:33.321 --> 02:34.755
we'd be having
this conversation so soon.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.257
You know,
Walker's still so little.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.360
I can be a mother
and have a job.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.095
Thank you.
Apology accepted.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.497
WALKER: * I can be real good

02:43.597 --> 02:45.699
I just want you by my side,
Teri.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.435
Mm.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.537
*

02:49.637 --> 02:51.405
WALKER: * Lo-o-o-o-ove

02:51.505 --> 02:53.241
What happened
with Treasure's album?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.377
Well, all that work

02:56.477 --> 02:59.747
and Lucious still put out
the original.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.849
(Teri sighs)

03:01.949 --> 03:02.883
You know, every time I try

03:02.983 --> 03:04.418
and do something good
for Empire,

03:04.518 --> 03:05.586
he blocks me.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.589
What you brought out
of Treasure,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.691
Lucious never could have.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.195
She finally started sounding
like herself and not a product.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.465
*

03:17.565 --> 03:19.567
How can you do that
with your other artists?

03:21.134 --> 03:23.237
Lucious can't block that.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.073
WALKER:
* Girls need love too

03:26.173 --> 03:29.277
(cheers and applause)

03:29.377 --> 03:32.045
Welcome back to Tea Talk,
ladies.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.414
How were your weekends?

03:33.514 --> 03:36.384
Well, I, um, got a chance
to catch up

03:36.484 --> 03:38.118
with my sisters,
so that was good.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.153
Besides that,
everything was pretty quiet.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.622
Oh.
(scoffs)

03:41.722 --> 03:44.292
Quiet?
'Cause that's not what I heard.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.728
(audience groaning, muttering)

03:47.828 --> 03:49.430
-LIZZIE: Uh-oh.
-(Janice laughing)

03:49.530 --> 03:51.399
-LIZZIE: Ooh.
-JANICE: Oh!

03:51.499 --> 03:53.467
LIZZIE: That does not look
like a quiet weekend

03:53.567 --> 03:55.068
with the girls to me, Cook.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.770
That's not how my friends and I
wine taste.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.171
-LIZZIE: Oh.
-(both laugh)

03:59.940 --> 04:04.177
Uh, that--that--that was
just a, uh--a misunderstanding.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.479
Oh, was it?
'Cause...

04:05.579 --> 04:07.748
(audience gasping)

04:09.283 --> 04:13.020
Damn, Cookie.
You haven't aged a day.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.655
Looks like bars
can't crack that black.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.856
(laughter, groans)

04:15.956 --> 04:18.258
Upstate is the new Botox.

04:18.359 --> 04:21.595
(laughter)

04:22.696 --> 04:23.831
That's good.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.265
It came to me.
I don't know.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.336
(laughter continues)

04:32.773 --> 04:34.675
(exhales deeply)

04:36.310 --> 04:38.612
You know what?

04:40.981 --> 04:44.852
You and the three brain cells
that you didn't freebase away

04:44.952 --> 04:46.554
must have thought
that was cute, huh?

04:46.654 --> 04:47.721
(chuckles)

04:47.821 --> 04:49.022
I should snatch your ass

04:49.122 --> 04:50.558
and drag you across
this stage

04:50.658 --> 04:53.327
with those dollar-store
extensions.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.195
(audience groans)

04:58.031 --> 04:59.166
(laughs)

04:59.266 --> 05:00.668
But guess what, y'all.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.302
Therapy really works!

05:02.403 --> 05:04.237
-(upbeat music)
-(cheers and applause)

05:04.338 --> 05:06.540
Guys, I am free!

05:06.640 --> 05:08.041
(laughs)

05:08.141 --> 05:09.710
I'm a brand-new woman, honey!

05:09.810 --> 05:11.912
*

05:12.012 --> 05:14.181
It really works, baby,
and that's the tea.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.884
Thank you.
Okay, so which one of you

05:16.984 --> 05:18.486
Jerry Springer wannabes
set that up, huh?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.754
Cookie, the audience loved it.
It was a good laugh.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.924
You're right, because prison
was funny as hell.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.394
You know what would be
even more hilarious?

05:26.494 --> 05:29.497
If I snatched your screaming
newborn from your arms,

05:29.597 --> 05:31.865
handcuffed you, and then took
a picture of your face

05:31.965 --> 05:32.933
as you're about to lose

05:33.033 --> 05:34.935
everything you love
in the world.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.938
Cookie, we're sorry.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.540
How can we make this up to you?

05:40.408 --> 05:42.410
I did a lot of thinking
when I was in Miami,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.678
and I miss music.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.713
Oh, we love that.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.681
We love--we love that journey
for you.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.716
Great, great.

05:48.816 --> 05:52.052
So why don't you give me
a music segment, okay?

05:52.152 --> 05:54.221
Where I make people's
musical dreams come true.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.255
Huh?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.124
What?

05:57.224 --> 05:59.760
-MAN: Um...
-"Um" what?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.463
Lizzie has her comedy corner
where her cronies

06:02.563 --> 06:04.031
allegedly tell jokes.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.533
Yeah, it's good.
It's a good idea.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.701
It's just that our show,
it's not--

06:07.801 --> 06:10.370
The format of Tea Talk
is rage, rinse, repeat.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.405
MAN: Yes.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.440
WOMAN: They say something crazy.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.575
You pretend-threaten to slap
someone's teeth out.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.210
We do it all over again.
Let's just stick to that.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.879
(exhales deeply)

06:18.979 --> 06:20.914
COOKIE: Breathe.
Move.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.819
-Damn, therapy works.
-It really does.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.090
Treasure's album sold
100,000 units

06:30.190 --> 06:31.492
in the very first week.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.962
She is number one
on Billboard, iTunes,

06:35.062 --> 06:38.065
and all ancillary
streaming services.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.467
Great job, everyone.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.135
(cheers and applause)

06:46.440 --> 06:47.407
-Mm-hmm.
-Confirmed?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.142
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.278
Do you have something
you wanna add, Andre?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.414
Actually, I do.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.851
Anybody see Billboard
this morning?

06:57.951 --> 07:01.755
And I quote: "A few bops,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.792
"but otherwise a paint
by the numbers Tiana 2.0.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.796
Who cares?
Does Empire have anything new?"

07:09.663 --> 07:12.032
Tiana 2.0 is not something
to applaud.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.967
Our music needs to have
staying power,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.003
and if every record
sounds like the last one,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.171
Treasure's next album
is gonna go wood.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.807
Excuse me, Pop.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.475
(dramatic music)

07:21.575 --> 07:23.310
We need a creative refresh.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.445
That's why I'm introducing
Empire Raw:

07:25.546 --> 07:27.314
a musical event to showcase

07:27.414 --> 07:29.650
our company's new vision
and sound.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.685
So you want to do Unplugged?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.855
Do you also have a time machine
to take us back to 1998?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.223
(laughter)

07:36.323 --> 07:38.058
I'm not talking
about scented candles

07:38.158 --> 07:39.693
and acoustic guitars, Pop.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.463
I'm asking each and every one
of you to dig deep,

07:43.564 --> 07:46.033
expose those parts of yourself
you've always tried to hide.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.968
That's where the power
of our artistry lies.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.638
You do that, I guarantee

07:50.738 --> 07:53.173
I'll win you more ASAs than
Empire's ever received before.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.143
LUCIOUS: Unfortunately,
the ASAs are nominating

07:56.243 --> 07:57.545
in less than two weeks.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.412
So what you're asking
is impossible.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.214
I believe in our team.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.050
We can pull it off.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.754
*

08:06.854 --> 08:09.156
Okay, I'm going to need
to ask everyone

08:09.256 --> 08:11.992
to leave the room for a second
so my son and I can talk.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.261
Stay right where you are.

08:14.361 --> 08:21.234
*

08:22.002 --> 08:24.171
Anything you have to say to me,

08:24.271 --> 08:25.405
say it in front of them.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.107
*

08:27.207 --> 08:29.376
All right.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.878
That's it.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.780
You've screwed up twice.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.715
You've cost us Tiana,

08:34.815 --> 08:37.785
and you almost derailed
Treasure's rollout.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.553
You are out as CEO.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.189
I am retaking the reins.

08:42.289 --> 08:46.126
You don't have the authority
to remove me as CEO.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.561
Empire shares are everywhere,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.730
and you're no longer
the majority owner.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.265
But since
you're a minority stakeholder,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.901
I'm happy to get you a table.

08:54.001 --> 08:58.205
It's VIPs only, but I'm sure
I can pull some strings.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
Anything for you, Pop.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.609
(tense music crescendos)

09:01.709 --> 09:04.612
(dramatic hip-hop music)

GISELLE: Girl, oh, my goodness.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.994
Your church performance got
2 million views on YouTube.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.062
What?

Your single, psht...

-Yes.

a full-scale cancellation

09:31.238 --> 09:33.306

and her edges intact.

Okay, I'm gonna set down
the soapbox for a while

09:38.378 --> 09:39.947
and, um,
just stick to singing.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.581
You know what?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.516
We believe in women
having opinions, obviously,

09:43.617 --> 09:44.918
but that whole...

09:45.018 --> 09:46.319
Oh, no, we are...

09:46.419 --> 09:48.355
BOTH: 100% behind you.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.524
Thanks, ladies.
Okay, so what's next?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.827
Okay, so we have gigantic plans
for your single.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.329
So gigantic but also
measured and thoughtful.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.631
-Absolutely.
-GISELLE: Yes.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.832
We're thinking
of going on tour.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.533
Why don't we shut down
some college campuses?

10:00.634 --> 10:02.602
Tour?
Yes, I love that.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.971
You know what?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.605
Childish Gambino
just gave, like,

10:05.706 --> 10:07.540
custom Jordans
to the first hundred people

10:07.641 --> 10:09.810
that came to his Coachella
performance--genius.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.445
Custom.
Custom like...

10:12.545 --> 10:14.815
-How 'bout Tiana Timbs?
-Boom.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.717
Great,
why don't we mull that over

10:16.817 --> 10:18.018
and then we'll get back to you?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.687
Okay, perfect.
Yay!

10:19.787 --> 10:21.621
-Bossy, Bossy.
-BECKY: Yay, Bossy!

10:23.223 --> 10:25.292
-What's a custom boot?
-(mouthing words)

10:25.392 --> 10:27.527
Oh, shoot.
You know what?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.896
I'm gonna give you guys
my glam squad's info.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.831
I know you haven't
worked together,

10:30.931 --> 10:32.332
but just to let you know,

10:32.432 --> 10:34.968
they don't travel business--
first or private only.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.137
Okay?
Just to let you know.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.471
Okay, bye, ladies.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.473
Bye.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.009
JT: * Till you ain't one

10:42.109 --> 10:44.511
Where are we gonna find
custom boots?

10:44.611 --> 10:47.380
And a--and a--and a beauty
SWAT team?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.682
I know.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.918
Look, I know
that things are tight,

10:51.018 --> 10:53.053
but we promised her
real promotion, okay?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.722
And having her on our label
must mean

10:54.822 --> 10:56.256
that we get credit someplace.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.326
Tiana needs to make us money,
not put us in debt.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.728
Ugh, we might as well
just call ourselves

11:00.828 --> 11:02.195
Broke Bitch Media.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.364
You know what?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.266
We're gonna turn this
into an opportunity

11:06.366 --> 11:09.502
to create an edgy
guerrilla promo

11:09.602 --> 11:11.671
that captures the attention
of the world.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.573
And guerrilla means cheap.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.276
Exactly.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.178
Dollar out of 15 cent!

11:20.213 --> 11:22.249
And then they wouldn't
even give me a segment.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.350
Can you believe that?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.420
I mean, that is
really messed up, right?

11:28.956 --> 11:31.792
Doc, come on, you gotta
give me something here.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.461
I'm not gonna sit here
and be mad with you, Cookie.

11:34.561 --> 11:38.031
Because when I look at this,
all I see are wins.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.599
(chuckles)
Wins?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.269
Okay, so getting drugged,
getting arrested,

11:42.369 --> 11:43.904
and then going
on national television

11:44.004 --> 11:47.074
to be humiliated,
those are wins to you?

11:47.174 --> 11:49.209
Okay, where did you get
this degree from, again?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.744
Did you get fired?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.480
-No.
-Did you go off on your cohost?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.884
-No, not this time.
-(laughs)

11:56.984 --> 11:58.919
And have you talked about
Lucious during this session?

12:01.154 --> 12:03.757
(melancholy music)

12:03.857 --> 12:06.593
And how are you sleeping?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.930
-Pretty good.
-DR. WICK: Mm-hmm.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.765
-Well, damn.
-(laughs)

12:11.865 --> 12:13.433
You are growing, Cookie.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.403
I can see the passion
and the light in your eyes

12:16.503 --> 12:18.005
coming back.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.907
So keep going, girl.

12:20.007 --> 12:23.243
Don't let one bad moment
mess up a whole string of good.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.778
(exhales)

12:24.878 --> 12:26.579
Celebrate your victories.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.348
(upbeat hip-hop music playing)

12:28.448 --> 12:31.018
HAKEEM: * Yeah, you know
we do this for the 99 *

12:31.118 --> 12:33.854
* Empire, yeah,
see, I get off at the dock *

12:33.954 --> 12:35.455
* And walk
right onto the block *

12:35.555 --> 12:36.924
* It's 2:00, call the flock

12:37.024 --> 12:38.258
* Tell 'em it's time
for the drop *

12:38.358 --> 12:39.860
* Look at the time
on my watch *

12:39.960 --> 12:41.028
He in there going crazy.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.463
Yes, come on, baby,
bring that heat.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.833
* Calling me hot,
I gotta get that *

12:45.933 --> 12:47.134
* Writing a whole lot
of records *

12:47.234 --> 12:48.869
* I probably should
spit facts *

12:48.969 --> 12:50.370
* I'm out of the gutter
if they cutting butter *

12:50.470 --> 12:51.704
* I'm with that

12:51.805 --> 12:53.273
* You know where to find me

12:53.373 --> 12:55.943
* I be with the currency,
I get stacks *

12:56.043 --> 12:57.777
* Bring the cash in, please

12:57.878 --> 13:00.447
* I just wanna live like
Cassius Clay *

13:00.547 --> 13:03.183
* Be the champ,
living so lavishly *

13:03.283 --> 13:05.618
* 'Cause who the hell
wants to be average *

13:05.718 --> 13:08.856
* When you got ingredients
to pass that, that *

13:08.956 --> 13:10.290
(Porsha laughs)

13:10.390 --> 13:11.691
ANDRE: You gonna do
his whole album, Mom?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.694
COOKIE: Sneak up on me again
and that's gonna be your ass.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.831
No, I just got sidetracked
coming up to your office.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.466
I just had to help my baby
bring the heat.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.835
You know that, and that he did.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.803
-Yeah, it was fire, Hakeem.
-Thanks, bro.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.338
That movie soundtrack
gonna be lit.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.007
-Yes, it is, baby...
-Thanks, Mom.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.808
-Thanks to you.
-I gotta get the kids.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.877
COOKIE: Yeah, you did that.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.544
*

13:31.644 --> 13:34.314
Oh, uh, guys, can we have
the room for a second, please?

13:34.414 --> 13:35.815
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.517
That was great work, though.
It's gonna be a hit.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.086
It's already a hit.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.988
Oh, my goodness.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.255
You and your brothers,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.556
y'all are so talented.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.425
You put me and your father
to shame.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.726
What did you wanna see me
about?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.496
-I have a Lucious problem.
-Here we go.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.763
No, he wants me out as CEO

13:50.864 --> 13:53.066
because I'm trying to let
the artist shine.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.534
No, baby, he wants you out

13:54.634 --> 13:56.536
because your name
ain't Lucious Lyon.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.439
And the better you do,
the more irrelevant he feels.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.941
-It's that simple.
-You still have

14:01.041 --> 14:02.009
your Empire shares, right?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.576
Yeah, I still have
my retirement plan.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.945
Well, use your remaining shares
to back me.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.613
-I need an ally.
-(chuckles)

14:06.713 --> 14:07.780
Baby, I love you,

14:07.881 --> 14:10.117
but I am not interested
in getting in between

14:10.217 --> 14:12.552
a pissing contest
with you and your father.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.954
'Cause it's only gonna
leave me

14:14.054 --> 14:15.222
pissed off and sopping wet.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.256
No, thank you.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.025
Ma, I don't know
what else to do, okay?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.093
If he stops Empire Raw,
then I'm out.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.128
Mm.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.096
What about everybody else,
Andre?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.231
Hmm?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.300
You know what made your father
so successful?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.701
He had a story,

14:28.801 --> 14:31.538
and when he told that story,
people believed in him.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.706
You have a story, baby.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.875
Tell your story.
People will believe you.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.046
I don't know that I have
a story to tell, Ma.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.981
You sure you don't wanna
produce Empire Raw with me?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.082
-Ooh, child.
-We could do something big.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.116
-Oh, oh, no.
-Ma--

14:43.216 --> 14:44.484
No, no, siree, Bob.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.919
I want my music.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.921
I wanna get back into music,
but it can't be with Empire.

14:48.021 --> 14:48.989
Honey, I'm tired.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.291
And that damn Tea Talk,

14:51.391 --> 14:52.592
they shut me down.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.928
All I was asking for
was a three-minute segment

14:55.028 --> 14:56.896
so somebody could doo-wop.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.665
When did a no ever stop you,
Ma?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.968
(sighs)

15:02.469 --> 15:04.571
You just get your story
together.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.574
(dramatic music)

15:07.674 --> 15:09.176
*

15:09.276 --> 15:10.243
(Prince whines)

15:10.343 --> 15:12.512
DEVON: Now there's no more
grapes for me.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.681
Can I have the last one?
(gasps)

15:14.781 --> 15:16.616
-Wow.
-TIANA: Oh.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.286
-DEVON: What's up, 'Keem?
-HAKEEM: What's up, bro?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.021
Glad to see you're back
in town.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.655
I heard the new track.
It's fire.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.191
I helped produce that.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.758
Oh, so you keeping
the Twitter haters

15:25.858 --> 15:26.793
off your back?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.495
(scoffs)
Trying to.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.264
I'm getting through it.
Thanks for asking.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.466
Come on, Prince, Bella,
it's time to go with your dad.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.435
-Come on.
-PRINCE: No!

15:35.535 --> 15:36.603
-TIANA: No?
-DEVON: I'm sorry, little man.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.171
Prince.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.339
TIANA: Come on, Prince,
it's time to go.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.840
DEVON: Go spend some time
with your daddy, all right?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.809
(Prince screaming)

15:42.909 --> 15:43.843
DEVON: Come on, man,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.478
spend a little bit of time
with Daddy, okay?

15:45.578 --> 15:47.614
Come on.
I know. I know. Come on.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.018
PRINCE: No!
No, no, no!

15:51.118 --> 15:54.687
No!
(crying)

15:56.389 --> 15:57.957
-(Prince screeches)
-TIANA: I'm sorry,

15:58.058 --> 15:59.859
they just been really bonding.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.129
Thank you for understanding.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.297
-No!
-No problem.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.166
(Prince crying)

16:06.266 --> 16:08.801
(both exhale)

16:08.901 --> 16:10.537
(elevator dings, opens)

16:10.637 --> 16:12.472
Hi.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.078
-COOKIE: Uh--
-LUCIOUS: Here you come.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.546
Look, man,
I've been trying to call you.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.713
I need to talk to you.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.981
We don't need to talk.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.417
Did Andre tell you
about his half-baked plan?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.253
I think it's a great idea.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.821
What, you mad 'cause you didn't
come up with it, huh, Lucious?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.990
I think you jealous
because you're afraid

16:31.091 --> 16:32.592
he's better than you.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.328
Look, our son is a genius

16:35.428 --> 16:37.330
when it comes
to multiplying money

16:37.430 --> 16:38.865
after we've made it.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.234
-But he's not us, Cookie.
-"We," "us"?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.735
He's never carried out
a creative vision

16:42.835 --> 16:44.504
from start to finish
unless I've laid

16:44.604 --> 16:45.938
the whole thing out for him.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.374
And if you keep pretending

16:47.474 --> 16:48.908
that he can do things
that he can't

16:49.008 --> 16:50.043
and you encourage this,

16:50.143 --> 16:52.245
he's going to ruin our legacy.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.714
"Our" legacy?
(laughs)

16:54.814 --> 16:57.384
He's gonna ruin our leg--
did I hear that right?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.018
Our legacy?
See, 'cause now,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.921
just a week ago,
you was saying how you built

17:02.021 --> 17:04.191
this empire on your own,
and you blew through

17:04.291 --> 17:07.427
my little, measly 400,000
on some bubblegum

17:07.527 --> 17:08.861
and 8-track tapes.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.199
But now you need me,
so it's our legacy, huh?

17:12.299 --> 17:13.733
Well, guess what, Lucious.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.203
My legacy is my boys.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.905
So I'm backing Andre.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.041
Hmm.
"Our legacy."

17:27.414 --> 17:30.150
BECKY: And through there,
a second ladies' room.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.652
You know, Becky, I thought
you were overselling, honey.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.987
You know,
start-ups can be tricky,

17:35.088 --> 17:37.257
and--and they--they don't
last long sometimes.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.326
But you know what?
This feels very special.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.228
You know, Tiana was
touch-and-go there

17:41.328 --> 17:43.596
for a moment, but it turned out
sinning was winning.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.798
So we're doing just fine.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.136
So what do you have planned
for her next after the single?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.104
Well, you know,
we're developing a strategy

17:51.204 --> 17:53.140
that will bring awareness
to her new music

17:53.240 --> 17:55.142
and our roster
at the same time.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.344
It's a slow rollout,
sort of low-budget.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.411
COOKIE: Hmm.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.313
More of a deliberately paced
strategy.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.450
What if I told you
I could shoot Bossy

18:03.550 --> 18:06.753
to the tops of minds
across America in one day?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.322
I thought you were done
with music.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.357
I'll never be done with music,
honey.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.659
It's just, you know,
Empire's--it's got

18:12.759 --> 18:15.362
a lot of baggage, but I love
what you're doing around here.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.530
Yes, sister girls
doing the damn thing,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.098
all by themselves,
no help at all.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.133
I love it.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.034
Okay, so what's the concept?

18:22.135 --> 18:25.972
That's it.
That's the concept.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.039
What do you mean?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.675
Okay, go with me.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.044
-Live music...
-BECKY: Mm-hmm.

18:32.145 --> 18:36.949
New York City girls dipping it,
doing it, day-drinking.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.352
Okay, those are a lot
of my favorite Ds.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.987
Broadcast on live television

18:41.087 --> 18:44.123
and across
every social platform.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.125
-So on Tea Talk?
-Oh, no, no, no, honey.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.027
Bigger than that.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.530
Let me produce this for free,
my treat.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.165
-On me.
-Wha--okay.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.233
We appreciate that,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.634
but what's in it for you,
Cookie?

18:54.734 --> 18:55.835
You know what?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.371
When you guys left Empire,
I was like, "They'll be back."

18:58.471 --> 18:59.872
I am so sorry

18:59.972 --> 19:02.008
for doubting the process,
honey.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.212
I'm gonna help you
get this bitch off the ground.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.182
Uh, well, let's confer.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.350
-GISELLE: Um...
-(stuttering)

19:10.450 --> 19:11.684
-We're in!
-COOKIE: Great.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.819
BECKY: We're in!
GISELLE: We're in!

19:12.919 --> 19:14.554
-BECKY: We're in!
-Great. Let's toast to that.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.423
SINGER: * Some blood pumping,
there ain't no denying *

19:16.523 --> 19:18.057
* I gotta push

19:20.260 --> 19:21.494
TRACY: Hi.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.896
LUCIOUS: Tracy.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.365
Oh.
(laughs)

19:25.465 --> 19:27.567
Thank you.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.101
You look lovely.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.837
Thank you.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.004
(gentle piano music
playing over speakers)

19:32.104 --> 19:34.707
I'm glad we both recognize

19:34.807 --> 19:36.943
we needed to reset
our relationship.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.712
I mean, it's important
that you see me as partner

19:39.812 --> 19:43.550
now that I'm so involved
in the day-to-day at Empire.

19:43.650 --> 19:48.020
Yes, your, um, contributions
have been...unparalleled.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.689
-Ah.
-(both laugh)

19:49.789 --> 19:53.125
And I have to apologize, um,
for not recognizing

19:53.226 --> 19:56.195
your business acumen
earlier on.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.799
I've been underestimated
my entire life, Lucious.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.936
I'd hate to see all of
your hard work be for nothing.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.972
What do you mean?

20:06.072 --> 20:08.275
Well, I'm sure you are aware

20:08.375 --> 20:12.279
of the challenges
that Andre has been facing

20:12.379 --> 20:14.113
as a leader in this position.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.484
I am aware
of the power struggles.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.787
But, Lucious,
you're the only man

20:20.887 --> 20:23.490
who's ever successfully led
the label long-term.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.493
So that means you will
support me?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.595
Of course,

20:28.695 --> 20:30.663
provided you support me

20:30.763 --> 20:32.899
on my latest musical venture.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.734
-But of course.
-Mm-hmm.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.236
*

20:37.337 --> 20:38.905
What if I told you

20:39.005 --> 20:42.108
we were already sitting
on a gold mine?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.076
Now, I have been listening

20:44.176 --> 20:45.612
to some of Philly Street's
new material.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.780
He may have put down the mic,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.516
but he has still got it.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.084
And now he has
a whole new generation

20:52.184 --> 20:55.288
of musicians to influence,
only as a producer.

20:55.388 --> 20:59.359
A comeback record
20 years in the making.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.760
*

21:00.860 --> 21:02.795
There's something to that.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.798
I mean, a lot of the artists
of my generation

21:05.898 --> 21:08.100
are the mega-producers of today.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.471
Isn't it funny how the people
we thought we left in the past

21:11.571 --> 21:13.673
keep coming back to us?

21:13.773 --> 21:17.777
*

21:17.877 --> 21:20.813
(siren wailing distantly)

21:22.114 --> 21:24.951
Oh, um, actually, Andre's,
uh--Andre's actually--

21:25.051 --> 21:26.986
I'm sorry, son,
but you leave me no choice.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.189
I have Tracy Kingsley's proxy,
and with it,

21:30.289 --> 21:32.792
I am taking back control
of Empire.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.162
KELLY: Lucious...

21:36.262 --> 21:37.797
we're all so glad
you're back.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.732
(foreboding music)

21:39.832 --> 21:41.701
You must be incredibly proud
of Andre...

21:43.736 --> 21:47.340
Putting his stamp on Empire
with the Raw event.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.241
Join us, Pop.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.911
I was just updating
our majority shareholder.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.213
KELLY: Andre was taking me
through the program.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.982
-It's ambitious.
-LUCIOUS: An event like this

21:56.082 --> 22:00.420
in two weeks, respectfully,
is reckless.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.423
Though big risks lead
to bigger rewards.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.825
That's what I learned
by watching you, Pop,

22:05.925 --> 22:06.893
back in the day.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.862
I know it's uncomfortable, son,

22:09.962 --> 22:13.400
to have to come and try
and take the reins of Empire.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.034
Well, I think it'd be
truly uncomfortable

22:15.134 --> 22:19.038
for all of us if AUSA Conway
were to become involved.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.607
Well, my name has been cleared.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.543
Well, yes, but public
perception is tricky.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.344
I'd hate to see our team's
hard work squandered

22:25.445 --> 22:26.613
over a misconception.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.515
That's a good point, Andre.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.249
Until the investigation
winds down

22:30.349 --> 22:32.619
and public perception
catches up to your innocence,

22:32.719 --> 22:35.455
I think it's best we stay
the course with leadership.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.056
I think that's wise.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.358
KELLY:
Empire Raw will go forward,

22:39.459 --> 22:42.194
and as far as the matter
of acting CEO,

22:42.294 --> 22:45.264
I'll reserve judgment
until after the event.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.200
*

22:48.300 --> 22:50.770
In the meantime,
let's do everything we can

22:50.870 --> 22:52.472
to ensure its success.

22:52.572 --> 22:57.309
*

23:01.247 --> 23:04.651
(whistle blowing)

23:04.751 --> 23:07.554
Hey, what's up?

23:07.654 --> 23:09.722
Thank you for joining us.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.791
Well, I--I don't have
a lot of time, you know.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.126
Andre wants to go through
a third run-through.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.330
Devon tells me that
rehearsal's been stressful.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.968
Um, Andre's under
a lot of pressure.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.436
Yeah, we probably
should get back in there

23:23.536 --> 23:24.804
before he starts freaking out.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.838
Yeah.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.307
Well, before you do,
I just wanna ask you,

23:28.407 --> 23:31.478
do you think this event
is a--a good idea?

23:32.679 --> 23:35.114
And you can be honest with me.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.583
(dramatic music)

23:36.683 --> 23:39.586
I mean, yeah, Andre
has been calling us in

23:39.686 --> 23:41.921
on every meeting
and blowing up our phones,

23:42.021 --> 23:43.022
and it is a lot,

23:43.122 --> 23:44.957
but at the end of the day,

23:45.057 --> 23:46.493
he's letting us lead.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.928
Well, it's good to be heard,
but...

23:49.028 --> 23:50.463
that's not real support.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.998
When you fell off that stage,

23:52.098 --> 23:55.434
who was there to help you
gain the confidence

23:55.535 --> 23:56.669
to get back on it again?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.205
*

23:59.305 --> 24:00.707
You did, Lucious.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.843
Devon...

24:03.943 --> 24:06.112
who helped you climb
deep into your soul

24:06.212 --> 24:08.447
and find your voice
when no one else could?

24:08.548 --> 24:09.549
DEVON: (sighs)

24:09.649 --> 24:12.685
You, sir.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.787
*

24:14.887 --> 24:16.989
Now, Andre means well,

24:17.089 --> 24:19.492
but the reason
that he forces you

24:19.592 --> 24:21.828
to rely on yourselves
is because he's never

24:21.928 --> 24:24.564
built artists
the way I built you two.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.967
Andre doesn't understand
how very fragile

24:28.067 --> 24:29.802
your artistry is.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.906
And if you recognize
the force that built you

24:34.006 --> 24:37.076
and are loyal to it,

24:37.176 --> 24:40.547
than that loyalty
will be rewarded.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.215
*

24:43.315 --> 24:44.483
(hip-hop music playing)

24:44.584 --> 24:45.885
ANDRE: Ay, yo.
(chuckles)

24:47.319 --> 24:48.588
*

24:48.688 --> 24:49.989
-(music stops)
-All right, brother.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.390
Oh!

24:51.490 --> 24:53.225
Nah, you better support
your artists, bruh.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.994
You remember
back when I was CEO.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.529
Hey, you're the only one
who hasn't blocked that

24:56.629 --> 24:57.897
from memory, Hakeem.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.699
-Come here, boy.
-That's cold.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.167
I appreciate you, man.

25:03.402 --> 25:06.505
Listen, I wanna thank you
for keeping your word

25:06.606 --> 25:07.674
and supporting me
over Lucious, man.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.041
-It means a lot.
-We Lyons.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.243
-That's what we do.
-Yes, sir.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.012
But if you wanted
to thank me, bro...

25:14.681 --> 25:16.348
Send Devon out on tour.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.951
(solemn music)

25:19.051 --> 25:22.354
Bruh, he's in my home,
eating cereal with my kids.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.956
Come on, man.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.225
I can't do it.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.730
How would you feel if some lame
was playing daddy to Walker?

25:30.830 --> 25:34.100
It's getting confusing,
especially for Prince.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.868
No, it's confusing for you.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.737
This is on you, Hakeem.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.272
*

25:40.372 --> 25:42.108
You asked for this.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.045
You jumped on that stage
and demanded

25:46.145 --> 25:47.313
that you were the lead
in the movie

25:47.413 --> 25:48.981
filming all over the country.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.418
And some CEOs would have been
pissed off at you.

25:52.518 --> 25:55.487
I saw a grown man
who could handle it.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.557
Maybe I was wrong.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.926
*

26:00.026 --> 26:02.394
So what I gotta do?

26:02.494 --> 26:04.230
ANDRE: You wanted it.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.099
*

26:07.199 --> 26:08.801
Find a way to work through it.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.102
All right?

26:10.202 --> 26:13.840
*

26:13.940 --> 26:15.241
(upbeat hip-hop music playing)

26:15.341 --> 26:16.275
(cheers and applause)

26:16.375 --> 26:19.311
Women and gentle ladies,

26:19.411 --> 26:21.080
please give it up for...

26:21.180 --> 26:23.582
-COOKIE: Excuse me, ladies.
-ANGELA: Tiana!

26:23.683 --> 26:25.818
(cheers and applause)

26:25.918 --> 26:28.921
(upbeat pop music playing)

26:29.021 --> 26:34.661
*

26:34.761 --> 26:37.029
* Baby

26:37.129 --> 26:40.166
* It's only right
to feel myself, yeah *

26:40.266 --> 26:41.533
*

26:41.634 --> 26:42.669
* Mm

26:42.769 --> 26:45.171
* Or maybe, yeah, yeah

26:45.271 --> 26:47.940
* You like it
when I cry for help *

26:48.040 --> 26:51.010
SINGER: * No

26:51.110 --> 26:53.545
* Tell me who's gonna

26:53.646 --> 26:54.981
SINGER: * Uh-huh

26:55.081 --> 26:57.016
* Love me like I'm dreaming

26:57.116 --> 26:58.685
*

26:58.785 --> 26:59.952
SINGER: * Uh

27:00.052 --> 27:01.988
* Baby, don't you do it

27:02.088 --> 27:03.222
SINGER: * No

27:03.322 --> 27:05.725
* Don't you dare wake me

27:05.825 --> 27:08.160
* Yeah, yeah

27:08.260 --> 27:10.529
* I don't know,
but I won't come down *

34:56.262 --> 34:58.697
You smug-ass son of a bitch.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.768
I do what I have to
to protect my kingdom.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.804
Oh, right, okay, so this is
all you got, Lucious, huh?

35:05.904 --> 35:07.139
This is all you have?

35:07.239 --> 35:09.040
You will hurt
your own children,

35:09.141 --> 35:11.477
your own company,
just to stay in the light, huh?

35:11.577 --> 35:13.512
It's the best for Empire,
trust.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.447
Whatever.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.717
Andre!
Tell 'em who you are.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.487
Tell 'em who my baby is!

35:21.587 --> 35:26.692
*

35:26.792 --> 35:28.994
(microphone feedback squeals)

35:29.094 --> 35:31.363
Okay.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.831
*

35:32.931 --> 35:34.366
MAN: Tell us
what's going on.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.836
*

35:37.936 --> 35:41.039
My father's life and love
has always been music.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.577
But I can't rap,
and I can't sing.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.415
So, uh, I lit a fire inside

35:49.515 --> 35:54.052
to master the business side
of music so that...

35:54.152 --> 35:55.221
my father would see me.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.556
*

35:57.656 --> 35:59.691
Didn't work.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.994
It wasn't enough,
and that fire burned me alive.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.663
*

36:04.763 --> 36:07.499
I thought that the only way out
was a...

36:09.701 --> 36:11.670
.45 to the temple.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.241
My finger on the trigger.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.076
Boom.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.079
(crowd murmuring)

36:21.179 --> 36:22.781
No bullet.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.184
*

36:26.285 --> 36:30.088
But music hasn't only
caused me pain.

36:30.188 --> 36:34.125
When I lost my first child, uh,
my brothers wrote a song for me

36:34.226 --> 36:36.762
to help make me
feel whole again.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.865
For those of you
who don't know,

36:39.965 --> 36:41.467
I'm bipolar.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.771
When I was manic,

36:45.871 --> 36:47.439
the only thing
that brought me down

36:47.539 --> 36:50.309
was to hum "Lean on Me"

36:50.409 --> 36:52.944
like I used to with my family.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.447
That's right, baby.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.716
I learned that music
has the power to heal.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.586
It saved me.

37:02.254 --> 37:05.491
Music saved my life too.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.627
So music belongs as much to me

37:08.727 --> 37:10.296
as it does to anybody else
in my family,

37:10.396 --> 37:13.131
as much as it does
to anybody else in this room.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.667
And as the leader of Empire,

37:15.767 --> 37:17.669
I don't wanna tell artists
who to be.

37:18.837 --> 37:22.674
I want to create a space
for them to share themselves

37:22.774 --> 37:24.810
with the world on their terms

37:24.910 --> 37:29.147
and make music that has
the power to help heal

37:29.247 --> 37:31.149
and inspire and guide

37:31.249 --> 37:32.518
in the same way
that it guided me.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.820
That is who I am!

37:34.920 --> 37:37.489
And that...

37:37.589 --> 37:42.093
*

37:42.193 --> 37:44.029
That's Empire's future.

37:44.129 --> 37:48.934
*

38:00.879 --> 38:03.882
(cheers and applause)

38:19.297 --> 38:21.232
I have never...

38:21.333 --> 38:24.202
been more proud
of you, my son.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.575
I'm actually
embarrassed that...

38:30.842 --> 38:33.745
It took me a minute
to really hear you

38:33.845 --> 38:38.016
and to truly see your vision
for Empire.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.188
I just want us to be able
to build it together.

38:44.523 --> 38:45.924
Please.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.531
(cheers and applause)

39:00.506 --> 39:02.708
And now I would like

39:02.808 --> 39:05.076
for Treasure
to come on out here

39:05.176 --> 39:07.178
and bless this stage
with a performance

39:07.278 --> 39:10.382
worthy of my son Andre.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.718
Come on out, Treasure.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.787
(cheers and applause)

39:17.756 --> 39:21.527
(melancholy piano music playing)

39:21.627 --> 39:23.729
TREASURE: * Oh, ooh

39:23.829 --> 39:26.264
*

39:26.364 --> 39:30.268
* Different people,
good and evil *

39:30.368 --> 39:34.806
* Stroking egos, superficial

39:34.906 --> 39:36.942
* I'm growing, learning

39:37.042 --> 39:39.077
* Tables are turning

39:39.177 --> 39:43.081
* I know who I am

39:43.181 --> 39:45.717
* Running, hiding

39:45.817 --> 39:47.619
* No point in crying

39:47.719 --> 39:51.457
* Over this

39:51.557 --> 39:54.660
I bare my soul, and all
they care about is Lucious.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.729
Andre, no, it was you.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.965
He just helped things along
a little bit.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.834
You're still CEO.
You won.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.670
I need a second.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.505
Can I meet you out front?

40:06.605 --> 40:11.176
*

40:11.276 --> 40:13.479
Of course.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.180
(whooshes)

40:15.280 --> 40:17.348
*

40:17.449 --> 40:24.322
TREASURE: * Just let me live

40:24.422 --> 40:26.257
What the hell
are you doing here?

40:26.357 --> 40:28.093
Don't be coy.
You want me here.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.328
*

40:30.428 --> 40:33.465
You'll only beat Lucious
if you play dirty.

40:33.565 --> 40:37.368
And that's not singing
and dancing for influencers.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.271
It means going for blood.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.040
I'm not gonna hurt him.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.843
What you need to do, my man,

40:44.943 --> 40:48.213
is put his pompous ass
out to pasture

40:48.313 --> 40:51.650
before his obsession
with this company's past

40:51.750 --> 40:53.351
destroys its future.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.488
It's what's best for him
and for Empire.

40:56.588 --> 41:00.358
* Don't even try it

41:00.458 --> 41:03.962
* You don't have to like me

41:04.062 --> 41:06.565
It's the only way
to save them both.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.066
TREASURE: * Love me

41:08.166 --> 41:09.400
(chimes)

41:09.501 --> 41:11.369
* You don't have to feel me

41:11.469 --> 41:13.338
* If you don't, it's okay

41:13.438 --> 41:16.374
* If you're not
thinking of me *

41:16.474 --> 41:18.143
LUCIOUS: See?

41:18.243 --> 41:20.812
No matter how bad
you talk about me,

41:20.912 --> 41:22.914
I'm always gonna
look after our boys.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.249
(laughs)

41:24.349 --> 41:26.718
Fathers are supposed
to put their children first.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.354
Why are you just
figuring that out, huh?

41:29.454 --> 41:32.390
You took his event from him,
and you made it all about you,

41:32.490 --> 41:33.424
as usual.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.693
Wait, I don't get it.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.427
I mean,
do you hate me that much

41:36.528 --> 41:39.364
that you can't see good
in any damn thing I do?

41:39.464 --> 41:41.600
No, I don't hate you, Lucious.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.036
I'm just finally seeing you
for who you really are,

41:45.136 --> 41:47.438
and that ain't much.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.506
Hmm.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.842
TREASURE: * Oh, ooh, ooh

41:50.942 --> 41:57.783
*

42:21.406 --> 42:22.941
Why are you here?

42:23.041 --> 42:26.244
TREASURE: * Just let me live

42:26.344 --> 42:27.412
*

42:27.512 --> 42:29.648
* I'm trying to live

42:29.748 --> 42:31.717
SINGERS: * Live, live

42:31.817 --> 42:35.120
* Oh, ooh, ooh

42:35.220 --> 42:37.155
*

42:37.255 --> 42:40.325
(cheers and applause)

42:40.425 --> 42:41.827
(laughs)

42:51.002 --> 42:53.571
(desolate music)

42:53.672 --> 42:54.973
Can we talk?

42:55.073 --> 43:01.947
*

43:15.927 --> 43:18.830
(dramatic hip-hop music)

43:18.930 --> 43:25.804
*
