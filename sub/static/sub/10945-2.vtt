<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.347 --> 00:03.448
Where do you think
you're gonna put them?

00:03.483 --> 00:05.950
Right there, as soon as I
get rid of those old wrecks.

00:05.985 --> 00:07.451
Grandpa's trucks?!

00:07.486 --> 00:08.952
No, dad, no way!

00:08.987 --> 00:11.222
So this dance at school,
you going?

00:11.256 --> 00:13.657
Oh, wait,
it's a father/daughter dance.

00:13.691 --> 00:16.660
I guess that could be problem
seeing as you don't have a father.

00:16.694 --> 00:18.996
I do so have a father.
His name is Peter.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.597
Grandpa, you are back!

00:20.665 --> 00:22.233
You know,
you were gone a long time!

00:25.469 --> 00:26.836
<i>Lou!</i>

00:28.139 --> 00:29.739
Where are my trucks?!

00:40.483 --> 00:42.684
What do you mean you can't
get in touch with stumpy?

00:42.752 --> 00:45.421
You're supposed to track down the
junkyard he took my trucks to!

00:45.455 --> 00:46.721
<i>Now, Jack, take it easy.</i>

00:46.789 --> 00:48.057
Don't get all wound up.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.192
Stumpy's at his fishing camp.
He's off the grid.

00:50.260 --> 00:52.561
There's nothing I can do
about that, but I'm trying.

00:52.628 --> 00:55.030
Well, you better try harder.

00:56.831 --> 00:59.400
Do you believe that guy
paying stumpy

00:59.435 --> 01:02.336
to tow away my trucks -
my trucks!

01:02.404 --> 01:04.837
Who does he think he is
to make that call?

01:04.906 --> 01:06.274
We're gonna find 'em,
Jack, okay?

01:06.341 --> 01:07.542
We're gonna find 'em.

01:07.576 --> 01:09.777
I'm away for a month -
a month, that's all -

01:09.844 --> 01:13.146
and everything goes to hell
in a handbasket!

01:17.618 --> 01:22.789
Okay, Katie, let's see what
we have in the mail right here.

01:23.757 --> 01:25.125
We have...

01:26.760 --> 01:29.495
Something mommy's
been waiting for.

01:35.535 --> 01:36.736
Peter!

01:38.739 --> 01:40.873
It's Georgie's adoption notice.

01:40.941 --> 01:42.475
It's official.

01:42.509 --> 01:45.010
That's great.
That's fantastic!

01:45.078 --> 01:46.344
I can't wait to tel her!

02:19.076 --> 02:20.543
You cleared those jumps
by a mile.

02:20.611 --> 02:21.978
That was an awesome run.

02:22.013 --> 02:23.379
Do you think I'm ready
for the show?

02:23.413 --> 02:25.181
Yes, I do.

02:26.216 --> 02:27.751
Good boy, Phoenix!

02:30.354 --> 02:32.021
Hey, Georgie!

02:32.055 --> 02:33.789
I really hope you can come.

02:33.823 --> 02:35.323
See ya.

02:36.092 --> 02:38.260
Jennifer chen is having
a sleep-over birthday party

02:38.294 --> 02:39.294
<i>and I'm invited!</i>

02:39.362 --> 02:40.696
That's great!

02:40.730 --> 02:41.897
No, that's not great,
that's awesome!

02:43.533 --> 02:45.167
Shoot, I forgot my jacket.
I'll be right back.

02:45.201 --> 02:46.501
Okay.

02:47.537 --> 02:50.404
So Jennifer
invited you to her party!

02:50.438 --> 02:52.173
Yes.

02:52.207 --> 02:56.144
Well, she invited me
too, but I turned it down.

02:56.178 --> 02:56.878
Do want to know why?

02:56.912 --> 02:58.079
Not really.

02:58.113 --> 02:59.914
Only the losers are going,

02:59.948 --> 03:02.784
which I guess explains
why you got invited.

03:02.818 --> 03:05.152
And watching you
at the dance...

03:05.186 --> 03:06.452
What?

03:06.487 --> 03:07.988
Way to make a fool
of yourself.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.923
I thought
I would die laughing.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.391
I'd actually like to see that.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.326
All the girls were
talking about you.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.728
You really shouldn't have
been there at all.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.628
Why?

03:15.663 --> 03:16.663
Hello!

03:16.698 --> 03:19.865
It was a "father/daughter"
dance and like I told you,

03:19.933 --> 03:22.234
everybody knows
he's not your real dad.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.437
That's just one big fat lie.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.908
Speaking of fat,
that dress you were wearing?

03:28.942 --> 03:32.644
Now I know why you stick
to your baggy jeans.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.780
Georgie!

03:45.524 --> 03:46.891
Oh, telephone.

03:48.427 --> 03:49.694
<i>Hello?</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:51.662
<i>Uh, yes, speaking.</i>

03:51.730 --> 03:53.230
Hi, Mrs. wheaton.

03:54.899 --> 03:58.268
Hold on, I don't understand
what you're saying.

03:58.302 --> 04:00.971
No. No, Georgie does not have
an anger management problem.

04:01.005 --> 04:04.574
Listen, there are always
two sides to these things...

04:04.609 --> 04:06.810
I'm sorry, she did what?

04:06.878 --> 04:09.578
Excuse me? Hello?

04:13.951 --> 04:14.984
Peter!

04:24.460 --> 04:26.061
<i>I'm lookin' for
three Chevy trucks</i>

04:26.129 --> 04:28.230
<i>that could've been brought in</i>
<i>yesterday.</i>

04:28.297 --> 04:32.901
One's a 1949
kinda faded out rusty gray.

04:32.969 --> 04:35.303
Then there's a '65.

04:35.371 --> 04:37.605
It's blue, like powder blue.

04:37.673 --> 04:41.208
And two-toned gold '72, and that
one's in pretty good shape.

04:41.276 --> 04:44.378
I got one matching the description
of the powder blue Chevy.

04:44.445 --> 04:47.081
What'd I tell you, Jack.

04:47.149 --> 04:49.183
Mind you,
you might be too late.

05:25.718 --> 05:34.325
♪ And at the break of day you sank

05:52.710 --> 05:54.044
She punched
her in the nose?

05:54.078 --> 05:55.578
I... are you kidding me?

05:55.612 --> 05:58.348
I know, it's terrible, but
you have to understand, Peter.

05:58.382 --> 06:01.817
Olivia wheaton is a horrible
little girl, like the worst.

06:01.852 --> 06:03.452
I can only imagine
why Georgie did it.

06:03.486 --> 06:06.088
No, I mean I get it, but that's
no excuse to punch a kid, right?

06:08.658 --> 06:10.392
You punched Caleb.

06:10.426 --> 06:11.660
<i>You can't begin
to compare the two.</i>

06:11.694 --> 06:13.362
I'm just saying.

06:13.396 --> 06:14.596
Okay, well, we are gonna
have to punish her though, right?

06:14.630 --> 06:15.930
You do realize that.

06:15.965 --> 06:17.098
<i>We have to hear
her-</i>

06:17.132 --> 06:18.699
But we have to hear
her side of things.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.335
<i>Honey...</i>

06:20.369 --> 06:21.602
Yes, we will hear
her side of things,

06:21.636 --> 06:23.371
but that does not change
the fact that she did it

06:23.405 --> 06:24.239
<i>and there are consequences.</i>

06:25.908 --> 06:26.975
Okay.

06:28.477 --> 06:30.211
See? All gone.

06:32.247 --> 06:33.347
It's not a game.

06:35.183 --> 06:36.616
Now Georgie, like Katie,
is gonna have learn

06:36.684 --> 06:38.451
<i>what's acceptable</i>
<i>and not acceptable</i>

06:38.486 --> 06:39.987
<i>just like Katie...</i>

06:40.054 --> 06:41.755
I'm sorry, honey.

06:44.259 --> 06:45.759
It's okay.

06:55.335 --> 06:57.336
<i>Yeah, we found one of 'em.</i>

06:57.371 --> 06:59.338
Hey, that's great.

06:59.373 --> 07:02.474
Right out of the crusher,
flat as a pancake!

07:02.509 --> 07:04.009
Oh.

07:04.076 --> 07:05.777
Okay, not so great.

07:05.811 --> 07:08.413
Well, I got a line
on one of stumpy's friends.

07:08.447 --> 07:10.215
He might have told him
where he took them.

07:10.283 --> 07:12.951
Well, get on it.

07:13.019 --> 07:14.352
<i>We must have
taken a wrong turn.</i>

07:14.420 --> 07:15.787
There's supposed to be another
dealer right around here.

07:15.854 --> 07:17.923
Well, there isn't.

07:17.990 --> 07:19.524
We could have passed it.
We should turn around.

07:19.558 --> 07:22.026
Ah, let's just forget about it.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.628
Hey, come on,
Jack, we're close.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.963
We're gonna find 'em.
I can feel it.

07:26.031 --> 07:29.066
Find what?
Another sardine tin?

07:31.702 --> 07:34.071
God this coffee is awful.

07:36.106 --> 07:37.373
<i>Hold on a
second, all right?</i>

07:39.576 --> 07:40.810
Where you goin'?

07:45.515 --> 07:47.050
Looks kind of abandoned.

07:47.117 --> 07:48.551
Jack it looks like hell.

07:48.618 --> 07:49.752
It could be fixed up.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.854
Should be torn down.
Come on, let's go.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.326
Why the interest?

07:59.162 --> 08:01.096
I don't know, I'm thinkin'...

08:01.164 --> 08:03.932
Amy and me, you know,
down the road.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.601
Way down the road, I hope.

08:06.669 --> 08:08.269
You got your head
in the clouds, Ty.

08:08.337 --> 08:11.538
You're dreamin' if you think you
can afford even a dump like this

08:11.573 --> 08:13.307
while you're goin' to school.

08:16.845 --> 08:18.812
That's kinda harsh.

08:23.918 --> 08:25.785
I got a call
from Olivia's wheaton's mother.

08:25.853 --> 08:30.256
I've got a client
coming so I'm gonna run.

08:33.558 --> 08:34.793
Look, I'm sorry.

08:34.827 --> 08:36.227
You're sorry?

08:37.464 --> 08:39.198
Honey, what were you thinking?

08:39.232 --> 08:40.765
I couldn't help myself.
It just happened!

08:40.799 --> 08:43.068
Well, it can't just happen,
okay?

08:43.135 --> 08:45.704
You're gonna have to learn to
stop and think before you act,

08:45.771 --> 08:47.072
and you're gonna have
a lot of time to do that

08:47.107 --> 08:49.340
because you're grounded
until further notice.

08:49.408 --> 08:51.609
What?! I can't be grounded!

08:51.643 --> 08:54.845
I have the spring classic show
to go to!

08:54.913 --> 08:56.080
No. Well, now you don't.

08:56.115 --> 08:58.182
And I have Jennifer chen's
birthday party!

08:58.217 --> 08:59.884
I got invited
and this is the first time

08:59.951 --> 09:01.752
I've ever been invited
to anything!

09:01.786 --> 09:03.854
I'm sorry, honey,
grounded means grounded.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.259
Honey, come on...

09:09.293 --> 09:10.727
The spring classic?

09:10.761 --> 09:12.162
She's been training
for months!

09:12.196 --> 09:13.430
I know, I know.

09:13.498 --> 09:15.698
Just let her think about it
for a little bit, okay?

09:15.733 --> 09:16.799
Okay.

09:24.074 --> 09:25.141
Hi.

09:25.175 --> 09:26.175
Hey.

09:26.209 --> 09:27.476
Dr. verani, Amy.

09:27.511 --> 09:29.045
Please, call me tricia.

09:29.079 --> 09:31.514
Okay, well, I understand you're
here to see some horses.

09:31.548 --> 09:32.515
I am.

09:32.549 --> 09:33.482
All right, follow me.

09:33.550 --> 09:36.585
We've got a few
to choose from.

09:36.619 --> 09:40.455
You know, I'm so excited.
This is like...

09:40.489 --> 09:42.090
Fulfilling a childhood dream.

09:43.292 --> 09:46.827
I bought the acreage and a pickup
truck and now I want the horse.

09:49.365 --> 09:51.032
Hello?

09:51.067 --> 09:53.034
Uh, no, I'm sorry,
he's not available.

09:53.101 --> 09:54.634
May I take a message?

09:55.570 --> 09:56.970
Oh.

09:58.706 --> 10:00.107
Really.

10:01.576 --> 10:02.809
Yes, I will pass on
the message.

10:02.843 --> 10:05.546
Thank you. Thank you.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.715
You know, I always
pictured having a two-tone horse,

10:08.749 --> 10:10.283
but he's quite something,
isn't he?

10:10.317 --> 10:12.818
I think you two
are really gonna get along.

10:12.852 --> 10:15.154
Amy, can I ask you something?

10:15.222 --> 10:16.589
<i>Hi.</i>

10:16.656 --> 10:19.492
Sorry, this is my sister, Lou.
Lou, Dr. virani.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.659
Hi. Tricia.

10:20.727 --> 10:22.462
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.430
Um, do you know where
grandpa is?

10:24.465 --> 10:26.864
Yeah, he left with Ty
to go look for his trucks.

10:26.899 --> 10:29.734
He's supposed to be at a
doctor's appointment in calgary,

10:29.768 --> 10:30.735
and he knew about it.

10:30.803 --> 10:32.170
I reminded him yesterday.

10:32.238 --> 10:34.706
<i>Our grandpa, he...</i>

10:34.740 --> 10:38.110
He had heart attack
a few months ago

10:38.144 --> 10:40.178
and he's been missing
his follow-ups.

10:40.246 --> 10:42.113
Sometimes seniors
can be a bit forgetful.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.514
Yeah, right.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.287
Can we talk?

10:50.355 --> 10:51.288
About what?

10:51.356 --> 10:52.889
About your doctor's appointment?

10:52.957 --> 10:54.592
Oh.

10:54.659 --> 10:58.228
I've had enough of doctors, Lou.
They're all quacks.

10:59.696 --> 11:01.231
What can I say?
Some doctors are.

11:05.902 --> 11:07.437
He's not so senior, is he?

11:10.141 --> 11:12.442
<i>Why didn't you go?</i>

11:12.510 --> 11:14.610
And apparently you missed
your last appointment too.

11:14.677 --> 11:16.878
You know, the one where you said
everything checked out fine.

11:16.912 --> 11:20.815
I've had it up to here
with the medical profession.

11:20.883 --> 11:24.219
And you know how much gas it takes
to drive all the way to calgary?

11:24.287 --> 11:27.022
Okay, well, if you don't want to
drive all the way to calgary,

11:27.056 --> 11:29.124
at least go see doctor gill
in Hudson.

11:29.158 --> 11:31.325
I called Dr. gill
and guess what?

11:31.393 --> 11:35.029
He's retired, and I'm not about
to go see some 20-something kid

11:35.096 --> 11:37.064
who's been a doctor
for ten minutes!

11:37.098 --> 11:38.732
That's the best excuse
you can come up with?

11:38.767 --> 11:39.833
I'm fine, Lou.

11:39.901 --> 11:42.136
There's nothin' wrong with me!

11:45.739 --> 11:46.939
Do you believe him?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.108
Oh, honey,
you gotta let that go.

11:49.177 --> 11:51.044
You know the more you pressure
Jack to do something

11:51.111 --> 11:53.213
the more he's gonna do
the exact opposite.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.016
I think I have an idea.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.451
Hey, Lou?

12:01.821 --> 12:03.722
Tricia
you were right, you know.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.425
He's super.
He's just so responsive.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.160
You guys were awesome together.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.763
So maybe you could give me
some riding lessons

12:11.798 --> 12:13.065
before I actually
take him home.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.202
Amy you know, I really would love
too, but I'm so busy these days,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.236
but, you know, I can definitely
find someone to do it for you.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.904
That'd be great.

12:19.938 --> 12:21.472
<i>You were looking
good out there.</i>

12:21.507 --> 12:23.174
Well, that horse
is making me look good.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.378
So, um, you're new in town?

12:27.413 --> 12:30.348
Yeah, just packed it up
and moved to the country.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.882
Wow! And what do you do?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.318
I mean, you're a doctor -
a medical doctor?

12:34.352 --> 12:37.053
Yeah, I used to work
at Toronto general.

12:37.088 --> 12:38.655
<i>Wow! Great.</i>

12:38.690 --> 12:40.757
Yeah, but I... realized

12:40.791 --> 12:43.594
I didn't have much of a life
anymore, you know?

12:43.628 --> 12:44.894
Too hectic.

12:44.962 --> 12:47.997
Yeah, I know hectic.
I used to work in New York.

12:48.032 --> 12:50.700
Well, this was always
my dream,

12:50.734 --> 12:53.502
taking over a practice
in a small town.

12:53.537 --> 12:55.771
You know,
seeing as you're new in town,

12:55.805 --> 12:57.773
you should join us
for dinner tonight.

12:57.807 --> 12:59.709
Now that's
country hospitality!

12:59.743 --> 13:01.944
I-I-I would love to. Great.

13:01.978 --> 13:03.512
Around 7:00.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.747
All right, we'll see you then.

13:04.814 --> 13:05.813
<i>We'll see you then.
Take care.</i>

13:05.848 --> 13:06.981
Okay.

13:09.385 --> 13:12.086
So that was awfully nice of you
to invite tricia for dinner.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.221
Yeah.

13:13.256 --> 13:15.790
Any particular reason why?

13:15.824 --> 13:17.559
Just country hospitality.

13:24.132 --> 13:26.500
<i>Hey, there you are.</i>

13:26.534 --> 13:29.436
I've been lookin'
all over for ya.

13:34.342 --> 13:36.710
Want to tell me what happened?

13:36.745 --> 13:39.178
You're going to be mad.

13:39.212 --> 13:43.249
Well, I promise to listen,
how's that?

13:43.284 --> 13:45.351
Look, I know I shouldn't
have punched Olivia,

13:45.419 --> 13:48.053
but she said some
really mean things,

13:48.088 --> 13:52.158
like really mean,
and it made me crazy.

13:52.192 --> 13:53.825
What did she say?

13:57.096 --> 13:59.331
Georgie?

13:59.365 --> 14:03.468
She, she said that
you're not my real father.

14:09.141 --> 14:14.111
You know, in business, when two
people can't agree on somethng,

14:14.179 --> 14:16.914
they get together and mediate,

14:16.948 --> 14:18.749
they talk it through,
get to the root of the problem

14:18.817 --> 14:22.787
so they can consolidate
and move forward.

14:24.556 --> 14:25.655
You need to talk to Olivia.

14:25.723 --> 14:26.989
Peter, I really don't want to.

14:27.057 --> 14:30.794
I know you don't, but it's
the right thing to do.

14:42.365 --> 14:44.699
I don't understand why
Jack's all bent out of shape.

14:44.767 --> 14:47.068
I mean, those trucks,
they were dangerous.

14:47.102 --> 14:48.303
They were falling apart.

14:48.371 --> 14:49.637
Dad, I can cut the carrots,
okay?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.605
I want them lengthwise,
not just chopped.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.907
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay, thank you.

14:53.975 --> 14:55.276
Yeah, and the next thing
you know one of the kids,

14:55.343 --> 14:57.944
Katie or Georgie's gonna fall,
they're gonna hurt themselves,

14:57.979 --> 15:00.481
they're gonna get blood
poisoning or worse.

15:00.515 --> 15:01.715
I don't want to hear it.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.083
The last thing grandpa needed
was something

15:03.117 --> 15:04.551
to put his blood pressure
through the roof.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.255
What are you doing
hanging around here?

15:09.323 --> 15:11.624
Better yet, why aren't you out
lookin' for my trucks?

15:11.659 --> 15:13.793
See? Jack...

15:13.827 --> 15:16.429
You understand why I did
what I did, right?

15:16.463 --> 15:17.563
To make room
for the sheep pen.

15:17.598 --> 15:20.700
Don't talk to me about sheep.

15:20.734 --> 15:23.201
And who's this person
comin' for dinner tonight?

15:23.269 --> 15:24.936
<i>I'm not in the mood</i>
<i>to talk to anyone,</i>

15:24.970 --> 15:26.305
<i>especially someone</i>
<i>I've never met.</i>

15:26.372 --> 15:29.541
Grandpa, she's a new client
and Lou invited her.

15:30.476 --> 15:32.344
Speaking of which, dad,

15:32.412 --> 15:34.613
I was hoping maybe you could
help me out with something.

15:34.647 --> 15:35.847
See, tricia just moved
from the city

15:35.881 --> 15:39.050
and she needs some riding lessons,
and I'm so busy I just thought...

15:39.118 --> 15:40.351
Oh, and I'm not?

15:40.385 --> 15:43.288
I mean, there's enough riding
stables around here she can go to.

15:43.322 --> 15:44.755
Lou...

15:44.824 --> 15:46.024
Yes, except the horse
that she's buying is from me,

15:46.058 --> 15:47.826
so I thought she could
get lessons on that one.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.028
Well, don't look at me, Amy, I
mean, I got enough on my plate.

15:50.062 --> 15:53.097
I can't be bothered teaching some
city girl how to sit on a horse.

15:53.132 --> 15:54.965
Um, everyone, tricia.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.068
<i>Uh, hi, again.</i>

15:58.102 --> 16:00.070
- Tricia, is it?
- Yeah.

16:00.104 --> 16:01.705
Tim Fleming. Hi.

16:01.739 --> 16:05.175
I'm the father of the girls.
I'll be teaching you to ride.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.443
Come on in.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.046
Actually, I taught the girls

16:09.080 --> 16:10.847
probably everything they know
about riding.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.618
So you're
liking vet school?

16:16.653 --> 16:19.121
Absolutely. It's kind
of a rough schedule.

16:19.156 --> 16:21.557
I'm also working at a clinic
in Hudson.

16:21.591 --> 16:22.859
In all his spare time.

16:22.893 --> 16:23.926
Yeah.

16:23.961 --> 16:24.927
You gonna practice here?

16:24.962 --> 16:26.728
Uh, yeah, um...

16:27.696 --> 16:30.665
Amy and I might start something
in the future together, so...

16:30.699 --> 16:31.766
That's fantastic!

16:31.800 --> 16:33.401
Yeah.

16:33.469 --> 16:36.637
How is it moving out here
into the country?

16:36.672 --> 16:38.473
So far, I love it.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.209
The outdoors,
those crazy mountains.

16:41.244 --> 16:43.410
You're a brave woman
for making such a big change.

16:43.444 --> 16:44.845
What brought that about?

16:44.880 --> 16:48.315
Well, I guess I
needed a change, you know?

16:48.383 --> 16:51.218
It was time for me
to move onto something new.

16:51.286 --> 16:52.486
Not new -

16:52.520 --> 16:56.056
I'm still doing what I did,
just in a new place.

16:56.124 --> 16:57.691
So what is that?
What do you do?

16:57.759 --> 16:59.392
I'm a doctor.

16:59.459 --> 17:00.860
Really.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.728
Took over a practice
in Hudson.

17:02.796 --> 17:05.098
<i>You know Dr. gill?</i>
<i>He's retired.</i>

17:05.165 --> 17:08.067
A doctor. You don't say.

17:08.135 --> 17:11.170
So please, feel free to call me
if there's anything you need.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.505
I mean, I'm even planning on
bringing back

17:12.539 --> 17:14.006
the lost art
of the house call.

17:14.073 --> 17:16.074
- That's fantastic.
- Cool.

17:16.108 --> 17:17.108
Lou?

17:17.175 --> 17:18.277
Mmm-hmm?

17:18.310 --> 17:20.578
Would you mind helping me
with the coffee?

17:20.646 --> 17:21.679
Sure.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.684
You tried
to pull one over on me!

17:26.752 --> 17:29.254
No, I didn't, I
was-so what did you do, Lou?

17:29.322 --> 17:32.556
Did ya share my entire medical
history with this woman? No.

17:32.624 --> 17:34.325
I told you, Lou,
I don't want a doctor.

17:34.393 --> 17:36.160
I don't need a doctor.

17:36.228 --> 17:38.229
This could be
a great arrangement!

17:38.297 --> 17:42.400
Okay, she's smart, you obviously
like her, she even does house calls!

17:42.467 --> 17:43.767
Lou-grandpa.

17:43.802 --> 17:46.336
Come on, you have to start
taking care of yourself.

17:46.404 --> 17:49.005
I mean, you just had a...

17:49.073 --> 17:50.807
Heart attack.

17:50.874 --> 17:53.410
I had a heart attack.
Why can you say that?

17:53.477 --> 17:57.847
I'm not dead yet.
Stop obsessing about this.

17:57.915 --> 18:00.850
Besides, you got enough problems
of your own.

18:00.884 --> 18:02.184
Like what?

18:02.252 --> 18:04.753
Well, like why is Georgie
sitting in her room right now

18:04.821 --> 18:07.622
staring at the walls instead
of coming for dinner with us?

18:07.690 --> 18:10.059
What's going on there?

18:11.894 --> 18:13.128
She...

18:14.064 --> 18:16.265
Ooh, ooh, what is it?
What's wrong?

18:17.733 --> 18:19.834
This coffee is what is wrong.

18:19.868 --> 18:22.803
It was horrible this morning
and it's horrible tonight.

18:22.871 --> 18:24.839
First I had to dig out
my old coffee maker,

18:24.873 --> 18:26.374
now you're messin'
with the beans.

18:26.408 --> 18:29.610
It's decaf, okay?
Caffeine is bad for you.

18:31.447 --> 18:35.015
What is it now?
Grandpa? Grandpa?!

18:35.049 --> 18:38.051
Tricia, can you come, please?!
Grandpa?!

18:38.987 --> 18:40.087
I've got my
bag in the truck.

18:40.154 --> 18:42.289
Here, I'll get
it, I'll get it!

18:42.357 --> 18:44.091
Grandpa, look at me!

18:44.125 --> 18:45.525
Let me look at him.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.627
Let's open that up for him.

18:50.764 --> 18:52.999
This is all your fault.

18:53.033 --> 18:54.266
How is this my fault?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.735
If you hadn't had
those trucks towed away,

18:55.769 --> 18:57.604
none of this would
have happened!

18:57.638 --> 18:59.906
I told you
how grandpa would react!

18:59.940 --> 19:03.194
And you driving him all around
the countryside looking for them

19:03.225 --> 19:05.033
when he should've been
at his doctor's appointment!

19:05.058 --> 19:07.114
Relax Lou, I didn't know he
had an appointment, okay?

19:07.148 --> 19:10.074
You know, maybe you shouldn't have been
treating him an invalid. He hates that.

19:10.170 --> 19:10.626
What?

19:10.642 --> 19:13.423
Okay, there's
nothing to worry about.

19:13.457 --> 19:15.392
It was just an attack
of indigestion.

19:16.494 --> 19:19.294
It can seem like it's heart
related, <i>but it wasn't.</i>

19:19.329 --> 19:20.396
<i>His heart is fine.</i>

19:20.430 --> 19:21.796
<i>I've given him an antacid.</i>

19:21.831 --> 19:23.899
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:23.933 --> 19:25.867
I should go.

19:25.902 --> 19:28.070
Thank you for a lovely dinner.

19:28.104 --> 19:30.506
I'll walk you to the car.
Give me your bag.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.673
Thanks.

19:31.707 --> 19:35.043
Um, thank you for your help.

19:35.077 --> 19:36.477
Oh.

19:37.579 --> 19:38.779
I'm just glad I was here.

19:38.813 --> 19:39.880
Yeah.

19:41.050 --> 19:43.084
Okay. Good night.

19:46.821 --> 19:48.256
Well, when you think about it,

19:48.290 --> 19:51.658
you know, if she hadn't been here...
If she hadn't have been here,

19:51.692 --> 19:53.793
it would have been
a lot less stressful.

20:05.506 --> 20:06.572
- You okay?
- Is he all right?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.640
Yeah! Oh,
yeah, he's fine.

20:10.444 --> 20:12.478
I know you were scared,
but don't worry about Jack.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.880
He is as strong as an ox.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.918
Look, I'm really sorry
about Olivia.

20:19.986 --> 20:25.557
I really am, and if you
want me to, I'll talk,

20:25.591 --> 20:27.858
not that it'll do any good.

20:27.926 --> 20:28.993
You know, I'll
tell you something,

20:29.061 --> 20:33.131
when I was a kid,
I was a real big guy.

20:33.199 --> 20:37.902
I was always the biggest one in
my class and I was real strong,

20:37.970 --> 20:41.305
and that meant that guys were
always trying to get me fight them.

20:41.372 --> 20:45.609
And most of the time I could just
walk away, but this one time,

20:45.676 --> 20:51.215
this one guy just pushed
my buttons and I snapped.

20:51.282 --> 20:52.882
I totally lost it.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.584
What happened?

20:54.651 --> 20:58.721
I ended up breaking his nose
and his arm

20:58.788 --> 21:03.692
and it scared the heck
outta me, it really did.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.529
So now, whenever I'm provoked,

21:06.563 --> 21:12.800
I just think about how devastated
I was by that and I walk away,

21:12.868 --> 21:17.739
or I just try to tell myself a joke
or I try to picture the person

21:17.773 --> 21:19.741
with carrots stuffed up
their nose.

21:21.177 --> 21:24.446
Carrots up Olivia's nose?
Love it.

21:26.681 --> 21:28.215
Okay.

21:29.618 --> 21:30.651
Good night.

21:32.787 --> 21:37.691
I know I'm grounded and I know I
can't go to Jennifer chen's party,

21:37.725 --> 21:41.895
but please, please, please
can I be in the spring classic?

21:44.898 --> 21:46.966
Let's sleep on it, okay?

21:48.235 --> 21:49.302
Yeah.

21:53.307 --> 21:56.676
It was completely crushed?
Ty, that's horrible!

21:56.710 --> 21:58.943
Fresh out of the compactor,
Amy.

21:58.978 --> 22:00.045
You should've seen
Jack's face.

22:00.079 --> 22:02.281
He was so ticked off I thought
he was gonna pass out.

22:02.348 --> 22:04.616
Yeah, well that explains
the heartburn then.

22:04.651 --> 22:06.818
We got a few places
to check tomorrow, but...

22:06.852 --> 22:08.453
Yeah, that's if Lou
lets him go.

22:08.488 --> 22:10.722
She's gotta stop worrying
about him.

22:10.756 --> 22:13.659
He's got to get back on the horse
and just live life normally.

22:13.693 --> 22:16.360
Between her and dad,
they're driving him crazy.

22:16.395 --> 22:18.396
Well, they're driving me crazy.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.963
Hey...

22:20.899 --> 22:22.333
You uh...

22:22.367 --> 22:23.334
You ever thought about
getting away

22:23.368 --> 22:25.403
from all this craziness?

22:25.437 --> 22:27.405
Yeah, all the time.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.641
You wanna save some time on
your schedule for me tomorrow?

22:31.676 --> 22:33.276
Sure. Why?

22:34.545 --> 22:35.812
I got something to show you.

22:35.846 --> 22:37.247
What do you want to show me?

22:37.281 --> 22:38.348
I
can't tell you.

22:38.416 --> 22:41.050
Yes, you can!
Ty, you can-!

22:41.085 --> 22:42.885
You've gotta tell me!

22:43.954 --> 22:46.189
Oh my God, honey,
I thought for sure

22:46.223 --> 22:47.956
he was having
another heart attack.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.925
But he wasn't.

22:49.959 --> 22:52.094
I know, I know.

22:52.128 --> 22:53.562
You gotta relax.

22:53.597 --> 22:55.097
Why are you so paranoid
and worried?

22:55.131 --> 22:59.067
I don't know.
I can't explain it,

23:01.471 --> 23:03.804
but it won't go away.

23:05.274 --> 23:08.142
Anyways, thank you
for dealing with Georgie.

23:08.176 --> 23:10.511
You are so good with her.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.616
When do you think we should tell
her about that adoption news?

23:14.650 --> 23:17.418
Well, let's let this blow
over a little bit first.

23:18.386 --> 23:22.856
She's gonna go and have a little
talk with Olivia tomorrow.

23:22.890 --> 23:27.527
Yeah, and I'm gonna go with her,
so, we'll see how that goes.

23:29.364 --> 23:33.333
You know, when you try,
you can be pretty amazing.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.768
- Really?
- Yes.

23:35.802 --> 23:38.837
Like, like how amazing?
If you had to put a scale-

23:38.905 --> 23:40.005
Don't push it.
Don't do that.

24:00.436 --> 24:04.272
Okay, I found the old
Chevy; That's the good news.

24:04.299 --> 24:06.633
Yeah. What's the bad news?

24:16.811 --> 24:19.946
Okay, there's still
hope for old Goldie.

24:20.014 --> 24:21.381
Let's go.

24:33.327 --> 24:36.728
Hey, Olivia,
Peter says we should talk.

24:37.763 --> 24:38.763
Who's Peter?

24:38.831 --> 24:40.598
Hi, Olivia. Yeah, I'm-

24:40.666 --> 24:42.968
I'm Peter Morris,
I'm Georgie's father.

24:43.002 --> 24:44.202
I called your mom, actually.

24:44.237 --> 24:45.503
Yes, she said you'd called.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.407
She also said I don't have to
talk to you, so I'm not going to.

24:48.474 --> 24:50.708
Hold on, hold on.

24:50.743 --> 24:53.544
You guys need to clear the air,
<i>I think,</i>

24:53.578 --> 24:57.648
and we're not gonna leave
until you do, so...

25:01.219 --> 25:02.553
I'm sorry.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.855
I'm sorry I punched you.

25:05.890 --> 25:08.758
<i>I really am,</i>
<i>and I didn't mean to.</i>

25:08.792 --> 25:10.126
But you did.

25:10.161 --> 25:11.828
You hit me and I was bleeding.

25:11.862 --> 25:16.433
You said some really mean
things and they really hurt me.

25:18.135 --> 25:20.203
Why do you hate me?

25:20.237 --> 25:21.938
I don't hate you.

25:21.973 --> 25:23.973
Well, what is it then?

25:24.007 --> 25:26.875
It's just that
you're different.

25:26.909 --> 25:28.510
How am I different?

25:28.544 --> 25:30.579
<i>You just are.</i>

25:30.613 --> 25:32.147
You're not like
the other girls.

25:32.182 --> 25:35.117
<i>Well, you're not
like the other girls either.</i>

25:35.151 --> 25:39.821
And Jennifer chen's party, I
found out you weren't invited.

25:41.457 --> 25:46.260
I said I was sorry, Olivia,
and can't we just...

25:51.033 --> 25:53.734
Can't we just consolidate
and move forward from here?

25:56.070 --> 25:58.071
I have to go practice.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.682
Well, I guess you
better get to practice too.

26:09.717 --> 26:10.817
What?

26:11.752 --> 26:14.086
Does that mean
I'm back in the show?!

26:14.121 --> 26:16.389
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

26:17.324 --> 26:18.590
I'm still gonna beat her,
though.

26:18.625 --> 26:19.958
What?

26:19.993 --> 26:22.061
- Not with my fist.
- At the spring classic.

26:24.398 --> 26:26.999
Come on.

26:27.967 --> 26:30.335
Okay, want to saddle him up?

26:32.838 --> 26:34.039
Of course.

26:34.073 --> 26:36.107
There you go.

26:36.175 --> 26:37.275
Whoa.

26:43.182 --> 26:45.715
Okay. Whoa.

26:45.783 --> 26:47.251
That's heavy.

26:47.285 --> 26:49.586
Let me get that around here.

26:49.654 --> 26:51.688
Okay, I got it.

26:55.927 --> 26:58.495
Okay.

26:58.563 --> 26:59.729
Okay.

26:59.797 --> 27:01.297
You went to horse camp?

27:01.365 --> 27:03.066
Two weeks... Yeah?

27:03.133 --> 27:04.367
Two summers in a row.

27:04.401 --> 27:05.901
Oh.

27:07.171 --> 27:09.305
They didn't teach you
how to saddle a horse?

27:09.373 --> 27:14.009
Well, it was a co-ed camp
and there was this boy...

27:14.078 --> 27:16.078
A boy who put the saddle on
for you.

27:16.145 --> 27:18.613
Yeah, and many years later
in the Dominican Republic...

27:18.681 --> 27:22.417
There was a boy who
saddled your horse for ya.

27:22.485 --> 27:24.052
Well you're not gonna get off
so easy this time,

27:24.087 --> 27:28.022
'cause this boy is gonna make sure
you know how to saddle a horse

27:28.091 --> 27:30.492
or you don't get any
riding lessons at all!

27:30.560 --> 27:31.693
Is that right?

27:31.760 --> 27:34.695
Do you know what this is?

27:34.729 --> 27:36.697
Very funny. A bridle.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.001
Hey, Jack. You feeling better?

27:41.069 --> 27:42.669
Top notch. Good.

27:42.737 --> 27:46.840
You know, that's not
the right saddle for you.

27:46.908 --> 27:48.641
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

27:48.675 --> 27:49.842
There's a smaller one.

27:49.910 --> 27:52.712
It's lighter,
but it's just as good.

27:52.746 --> 27:54.747
It's better for a beginner.

27:54.815 --> 27:58.784
Oh, Lisa's saddle.
His, his lady friend.

27:58.852 --> 28:00.686
<i>Anyone can use it, Tim.</i>

28:01.755 --> 28:04.490
Can they now? Really.

28:05.592 --> 28:07.859
Oh, shoot, I gotta go.

28:07.893 --> 28:09.828
One of my patients
just fell off a jungle gym.

28:09.895 --> 28:11.263
Mmm, poor kid.

28:11.331 --> 28:12.498
Not so much.

28:12.532 --> 28:14.099
He's a 35-year-old man
who should know better.

28:15.935 --> 28:17.469
Can we take this up tomorrow?

28:17.504 --> 28:18.470
You bet!

28:18.505 --> 28:20.671
<i>Great. Jack.</i>

28:22.774 --> 28:24.509
She's funny.

28:25.644 --> 28:29.046
Speaking of lady friends, you
spoken to Lisa since the...

28:29.080 --> 28:31.315
It's none of your business.

28:31.350 --> 28:32.617
Well, she was trying
to get a hold of you.

28:32.651 --> 28:33.751
We talked.

28:33.785 --> 28:35.986
You talked-
Anyway...

28:36.021 --> 28:37.120
You'll be pleased to know

28:37.188 --> 28:39.222
that I found another
one of my trucks.

28:39.257 --> 28:40.624
Great!

28:40.691 --> 28:42.425
Stripped right to the bone.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.361
It's demolished!

28:45.296 --> 28:47.364
You owe me big.

28:57.774 --> 28:59.475
<i>Jack?</i>

29:00.677 --> 29:01.810
Jack?

29:02.845 --> 29:04.146
I'm uh...

29:04.181 --> 29:06.715
I'm sorry about the trucks.

29:06.749 --> 29:08.916
I am.

29:08.950 --> 29:10.318
I'll help you look
for old Goldie.

29:10.352 --> 29:13.254
No way you're helping me.

29:13.289 --> 29:15.623
I know you hate those trucks.

29:15.658 --> 29:16.957
To you they're just an eyesore -

29:16.992 --> 29:19.894
or a place to keep
your stupid sheep -

29:19.928 --> 29:21.262
but not to me.

29:21.330 --> 29:24.498
That gold truck was an
anniversary present from lindy.

29:24.532 --> 29:26.466
I know, I know, I know.

29:26.501 --> 29:28.235
I've heard the story
a 100 times.

29:28.303 --> 29:30.170
Well, I know it's hard
for you to understand,

29:30.238 --> 29:34.541
but it had a special place in
my heart, and because of you

29:34.576 --> 29:35.775
I'll probably never
see it again.

29:35.810 --> 29:37.977
Jack...

29:38.012 --> 29:40.746
Nothing lasts forever,
things change.

29:40.814 --> 29:41.747
Yeah.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.015
Just look at me and Miranda.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.451
Think of how I feel.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.988
Sometimes you gotta learn
to roll with it.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.473
Hey. So?

30:09.442 --> 30:11.042
What is it
you wanted to show me?

30:11.110 --> 30:13.544
You need to see this place.

30:13.578 --> 30:16.847
It's abandoned.
Not a soul around.

30:16.914 --> 30:18.415
You want to explore?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.550
Yeah. Let's go.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.688
I love this! This is so cool!

30:25.890 --> 30:26.557
Come on, let's
check out the barn!

30:26.625 --> 30:27.891
Oh yeah!

30:31.328 --> 30:33.963
Come on, I'll race ya!

30:34.030 --> 30:35.398
Go!

30:41.672 --> 30:43.740
Honey, I'm home!

30:43.807 --> 30:44.773
Oh.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.807
Oh! Geez!

30:47.810 --> 30:49.344
Hey, wait!

30:54.816 --> 30:55.916
You can put
your office in there.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.151
Or your vet clinic.

30:57.185 --> 30:58.152
Yeah.

31:02.758 --> 31:06.226
You know, when I was a kid, I wished
I had a place just like this.

31:06.261 --> 31:09.329
Do you think a kid
would love this place?

31:09.363 --> 31:12.766
Yeah, absolutely.
What's not to love?

31:14.868 --> 31:16.770
Do you want kids?

31:20.374 --> 31:21.374
Do you?

31:21.409 --> 31:22.475
Yeah. Yeah?

31:22.543 --> 31:23.976
Yeah.

31:24.011 --> 31:25.110
How many do you want?

31:25.144 --> 31:27.479
Oh, I don't
know, two at least.

31:27.547 --> 31:28.714
Well,
let's start with one.

31:28.782 --> 31:30.316
Okay. Boy or girl?

31:31.250 --> 31:32.751
I'll be happy
no matter what.

31:41.379 --> 31:42.613
<i>Guess what, coach?</i>

31:42.647 --> 31:43.681
What?

31:43.716 --> 31:44.682
I'm back in the show.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.084
I know. Lou texted me.

31:46.118 --> 31:47.185
That's great.
You're more than ready.

31:48.385 --> 31:49.586
- I gotta get going.
- You do?

31:49.620 --> 31:51.088
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

31:51.122 --> 31:53.590
Thank you for a
beautiful afternoon.

31:54.558 --> 31:55.959
Gross.

31:59.296 --> 32:00.330
Hey, Jack.

32:00.364 --> 32:02.665
Ty... I wanted to thank you

32:02.700 --> 32:05.167
for driving all over
the countryside with me.

32:05.202 --> 32:07.502
No problem. We got a few more
places on our list to hit tomorrow.

32:07.537 --> 32:09.872
No. No, we don't.

32:11.074 --> 32:12.507
What are you talkin' about?

32:12.542 --> 32:16.645
I've decided to give
up on trying to find Goldie.

32:16.679 --> 32:21.515
Yes, it had a lot of memories
for me - good ones - but...

32:21.550 --> 32:25.419
Well, I'll always have those,
they're not goin' anywhere.

32:25.454 --> 32:28.522
Come on, Jack, it could be at
the very next yard we look at.

32:28.557 --> 32:29.557
We can't give up now.

32:29.591 --> 32:32.293
No, it's okay.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.062
There's somethin' else.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.033
I uh...

32:41.169 --> 32:43.070
I shouldn't have been
so down on you

32:43.104 --> 32:46.106
about wanting to buy
that property.

32:47.208 --> 32:49.442
Of course you need to dream
about the future.

32:49.477 --> 32:50.944
That's important.

32:52.246 --> 32:58.717
Tim said something to me,
something reasonable for once.

32:58.786 --> 33:03.622
He said that I have to learn
to roll with change,

33:03.657 --> 33:09.961
and he's right, I do,
though it pains me to say.

33:11.931 --> 33:15.667
You know, I could never
say this to Lou, but...

33:15.701 --> 33:18.670
That heart issue,

33:18.737 --> 33:23.208
it scared me, Ty, but
at the same time

33:23.276 --> 33:27.311
it gave me a new way
to look at things.

33:27.378 --> 33:30.881
You know that song
"live like you were dyin'"?

33:30.916 --> 33:35.352
I know it sounds maudlin, but
it ain't so far from the truth.

33:36.321 --> 33:38.789
So you...

33:38.824 --> 33:41.224
You got to seize the day.

33:41.292 --> 33:42.992
You go for it.

33:45.162 --> 33:48.031
I'm gonna try, Jack. Thanks.

33:50.935 --> 33:54.103
And, uh, I'm not giving up
on that truck either.

34:06.782 --> 34:08.283
You almost ready?

34:08.351 --> 34:09.284
For what?

34:09.351 --> 34:10.518
Georgie's show!

34:10.585 --> 34:13.786
Oh, of course I am!
I'm ready when you are.

34:14.755 --> 34:17.123
Now look at this.
You see that?

34:17.192 --> 34:21.362
This, this is the coffee
we'll be using from now on.

34:21.396 --> 34:22.830
<i>That other decaf stuff,</i>

34:22.898 --> 34:26.934
you can throw it out
'cause life is too short.

34:27.002 --> 34:29.069
It's way too short.

34:32.974 --> 34:34.440
Okay, I'm sorry.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.541
No, you know what?

34:35.576 --> 34:37.310
I didn't mean it
quite like that.

34:37.378 --> 34:40.847
You have to stop pretending
this didn't happen.

34:40.882 --> 34:44.917
You had a heart attack and you may
have no trouble saying the words,

34:44.951 --> 34:46.551
but I don't think you're
taking in what they mean.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.619
Aw, Lou, please-

34:47.687 --> 34:49.855
<i>No, no, no, listen to me.</i>

34:49.922 --> 34:51.123
You have to take care
of yourself

34:51.157 --> 34:57.729
- not just for yourself, but for the family...
- And for me.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.731
Do you know that
you are the only man

35:00.766 --> 35:02.967
I have ever been able
to fully depend on.

35:03.002 --> 35:04.369
Now that is not true.

35:04.403 --> 35:08.039
It is true.
You're my rock, grandpa.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.808
You are the rock
of this whole family

35:10.842 --> 35:13.311
And if we ever lost you...

35:13.345 --> 35:15.013
Just calm down.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.817
Lou, I am fine.

35:20.851 --> 35:22.252
I am fine.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.189
Don't we have a show
to get to?

35:34.197 --> 35:37.900
<i>Now on the course,
number 7, Olivia wheaton.</i>

35:53.515 --> 35:54.882
She's really good.

35:54.917 --> 35:56.284
Yeah, she is,

35:56.319 --> 35:58.619
but you see how wide she went
on that last jump there?

35:58.654 --> 35:59.854
You don't have to go
that wide.

35:59.922 --> 36:02.757
<i>Cut it closer.</i>
<i>You know, save some time.</i>

36:02.791 --> 36:03.991
<i>Okay.</i>

36:04.025 --> 36:05.926
Just stay focused.

36:05.961 --> 36:09.096
Breathe and stay
nice and calm, okay?

36:09.130 --> 36:12.099
I'm scared out of my mind.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.075
<i>Number 7, Olivia
wheaton, 46 seconds!</i>

36:27.814 --> 36:29.482
Okay.

36:29.516 --> 36:34.120
Listen, you and Phoenix are
gonna do great, all right?

36:34.188 --> 36:36.488
And try to have some fun
out there too, huh?

36:36.522 --> 36:38.223
Okay.

36:38.257 --> 36:41.759
And now the last rider
in this year's spring classic:

36:41.794 --> 36:44.529
<i>Number 15, Georgina crawley.</i>

37:28.438 --> 37:31.907
Number 15, Georgina crawley,
with the best time of the day:

37:31.974 --> 37:33.074
<i>Forty-two seconds!</i>

37:33.108 --> 37:34.475
- She won, didn't she?
- Yeah!

37:35.578 --> 37:37.546
Yeah, Georgie!

37:37.580 --> 37:38.980
Woo!

37:45.220 --> 37:46.754
Great job! You looked awesome.

37:46.821 --> 37:48.989
Thanks. Thank you.

37:50.291 --> 37:51.291
Awesome!

37:52.827 --> 37:55.462
So good, honey! Oh!

37:57.832 --> 37:59.466
Um, I'll be right back.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.568
Okay.

38:04.939 --> 38:05.905
Hey.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.206
Hey.

38:07.274 --> 38:09.609
You were a good competitor.

38:10.844 --> 38:12.478
You should
enjoy that ribbon.

38:12.546 --> 38:15.381
You won't be winning one again
because it's all about the horse,

38:15.449 --> 38:16.683
and I can always buy
a better horse

38:16.717 --> 38:19.785
than you could ever dream
of affording.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.895
Carrots up her nose,
carrots up her nose...

38:29.929 --> 38:31.163
Carrots up her nose...

38:31.198 --> 38:32.298
Carrots up her nose?

38:34.067 --> 38:35.200
Forget it.

38:35.234 --> 38:37.034
What's that about?
What's that?

38:39.405 --> 38:40.871
I'm so proud of you.

38:48.214 --> 38:49.981
Come on, get that horse.
Let's go.

39:03.533 --> 39:06.735
Relax, this is your decaf.

39:06.769 --> 39:08.770
Look, if you want
your regular brand,

39:08.805 --> 39:11.206
then go for it, okay?
I can't stop you.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.640
Hey, Lou...

39:15.611 --> 39:20.748
I get what you are
saying, I do,

39:20.782 --> 39:26.887
and I want you to know I'm real
aware of what happened to me,

39:26.955 --> 39:28.922
but you're right;

39:28.956 --> 39:31.057
I need to look after
my health.

39:31.092 --> 39:34.128
I want to see Amy and Ty
get married

39:34.195 --> 39:37.131
and Katie and Georgie
grow up and...

39:38.500 --> 39:41.635
So I've decided
I'll start seeing that doctor

39:41.669 --> 39:45.738
and not just because
you tricked me into it.

39:49.143 --> 39:50.876
Thank you.

39:53.180 --> 39:54.880
Come here.

40:05.691 --> 40:08.193
There we go. Looks good.

40:10.329 --> 40:13.698
You know, I gotta say you handled
yourself really well out there

40:13.766 --> 40:16.267
and I am pretty darn proud
of you.

40:16.334 --> 40:17.601
Not just because you won either,
you know,

40:17.669 --> 40:21.772
because you were the better
person when it came to Olivia.

40:21.839 --> 40:24.175
And, uh, we have some news
for you.

40:26.144 --> 40:28.179
The adoption papers arrived.

40:29.781 --> 40:31.681
Signed and sealed.

40:31.748 --> 40:35.818
<i>You are now
officially our daughter.</i>

40:39.890 --> 40:40.657
How about that?!

40:42.826 --> 40:43.926
Come here!

41:00.943 --> 41:02.110
Damn.

41:02.178 --> 41:04.245
Yeah.

41:04.313 --> 41:07.081
Ah, there'll be other farms.

41:07.115 --> 41:09.517
Yeah, I guess.

41:11.953 --> 41:13.787
Damn.
