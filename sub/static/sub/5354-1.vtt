00:15.066 --> 00:17.501
- How do I look?
- Ghastly.

00:17.839 --> 00:19.468
- Are we rolling?
- Yep.

00:19.502 --> 00:20.921
- Okay.

00:21.663 --> 00:24.677
3 years ago, the police of
Orleans Parish, Louisiana,

00:24.702 --> 00:27.779
started finding bodies,
in pieces.

00:27.804 --> 00:31.589
The work of a serial killer,
nicknamed, "The Butcher."

00:31.614 --> 00:35.438
A long man hunt ended 
not with an axe wielding maniac,

00:35.463 --> 00:38.606
but a 17 year old boy,
Jesse Winters.

00:38.631 --> 00:41.517
After his capture,
Jesse was tried as an adult,

00:41.542 --> 00:45.472
found guilty of 22 murders
and sentenced to death.

00:45.497 --> 00:47.874
On his 18th birthday,
he was executed at the

00:47.899 --> 00:51.885
Louisiana State Penitentiary,
by lethal injection.

00:52.110 --> 00:55.935
The curious thing about his case,
however, was not the murders,

00:55.960 --> 00:58.250
but rather, his legal defense.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.686
Jesse's mother insisted,
that he was innocent.

01:01.711 --> 01:04.754
She claimed that Jesse had
been possessed for over a year

01:04.780 --> 01:07.647
and that varies exorcism
attempts had failed.

01:07.672 --> 01:09.827
His final exorcism
performed by now,

01:09.852 --> 01:12.745
excommunicated priest,
Father Robert Tomlin,

01:12.770 --> 01:16.267
was the last time his mother
saw him before his arrest.

01:16.292 --> 01:19.290
Now, for the first time
outside the courtroom,

01:19.315 --> 01:22.967
we can show the tape
of Jesse's failed exorcism.

01:22.992 --> 01:26.922
Now, the images you're
about to see, are graphic.

01:26.947 --> 01:30.325
And we advise younger, sensitive
viewers to look away.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.731
Case # 42 Jesse Winters
Property of Baton Rouge Police Department

01:32.756 --> 01:34.744
You're not welcome into
the body of this child!

01:34.769 --> 01:37.373
You're not welcome,
I cast you out!

01:39.684 --> 01:42.219
- You're hurting him!
- No! It's the demon I'm hurting!

01:42.244 --> 01:43.504
Jesse.

01:43.529 --> 01:45.003
Oh, Christ.
There's no pulse.

01:45.028 --> 01:46.804
- Don't do this, Dr. Winters!
- Leave us alone!

01:46.829 --> 01:48.667
Stop it!
You'll put us all in danger!

01:48.692 --> 01:50.462
- Get away! We're leaving, Rob!
- Don't!

01:50.487 --> 01:52.417
Don't do this!

01:53.014 --> 01:56.336
Jesse, stop!
Don't do this! Jesse!

01:58.071 --> 02:00.429
Jesse, stop.
Don't hurt me.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.159
I would never hurt you.

02:09.252 --> 02:12.057
Jesse escaped and began
his murderous rampage.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.673
Starting with his own father.

02:14.698 --> 02:17.357
But this documentary
is not about Jesse,

02:17.382 --> 02:19.382
it's about his mother, Kate.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.390
Kate Winters claims
that she can prove

02:21.415 --> 02:24.774
that Jesse was indeed
possessed by a demon.

02:24.799 --> 02:26.190
How?

02:26.217 --> 02:27.517
For the first time on camera,

02:27.542 --> 02:31.343
Kate is going to herself,
become possess by a demon.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.046
Will it work?

02:33.071 --> 02:35.144
Or is she a fake?

02:35.985 --> 02:46.758
<font color="#ff7575">THE EXORCISM TAPES</font>

02:48.519 --> 02:50.135
Day 1

02:50.160 --> 02:52.458
Yes, uh.
We got turned around at the exit.

02:52.483 --> 02:54.809
We're on the way
to your house now.

02:56.128 --> 02:58.877
Probably 5 minutes.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.806
Okay.

03:02.492 --> 03:05.047
We're a few minutes late
and she's already calling?

03:05.072 --> 03:07.353
She's fucking crazy, Stu.

03:07.378 --> 03:09.272
Nah.
She's not crazy.

03:09.297 --> 03:12.616
When rich people are crazy,
it's called eccentric.

03:12.883 --> 03:15.153
Her son killed 23 people.

03:15.178 --> 03:18.408
Don't raise a child like that
unless you're fucking crazy.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.213
- Everything look good?
- Yep.

03:20.238 --> 03:22.147
Well, double check it,
because I swear, Joey,

03:22.172 --> 03:24.237
if you bring me a bunch
of out of focus shots

03:24.262 --> 03:26.942
you'll never touch a camera again.

03:28.385 --> 03:29.842
Well.
She can just...

03:29.867 --> 03:32.844
chill the fuck out,
'cause we're almost there.

03:33.011 --> 03:35.162
Alright.
We're here.

03:35.187 --> 03:37.165
Alright, guys.
Let's be professional.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.765
No laughing. No joking.
No comments.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.361
No matter what kind of
weird shit you hear, okay?

03:41.386 --> 03:44.865
This lady is paying us a lot of money,
so let's just do our job.

03:45.256 --> 03:46.742
Alright.

03:48.466 --> 03:50.013
Okay.

03:55.716 --> 03:59.021
I baptized Jesse.
I knew him his entire life.

03:59.046 --> 04:00.789
He's just a perfectly normal kid.

04:00.814 --> 04:04.355
And this thing at the end,
that wasn't Jesse.

04:04.380 --> 04:08.110
So, yes,
Absolutely, he was possessed.

04:08.135 --> 04:09.511
That's why Jesse kill people.

04:09.536 --> 04:13.431
No, it was the demon inside him
that killed those people.

04:13.656 --> 04:16.176
How many exorcism have you done?

04:16.605 --> 04:18.314
Quite a few.

04:18.339 --> 04:21.596
But I will tell you, there was something
very different about Jesse's case.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.232
Something like I've never seen before.

04:24.257 --> 04:26.631
This demon was stronger,

04:26.741 --> 04:28.732
more in control.

04:36.384 --> 04:39.704
So, this is the scene of the infamous
Jesse Winters's exorcism.

04:39.729 --> 04:41.945
- Yes.
- Any regrets?

04:41.970 --> 04:45.125
None.
I take full responsibility for everything.

04:45.150 --> 04:49.059
The tapes. My excommunication.
Everything.

04:49.084 --> 04:51.187
So, what went wrong?

04:51.699 --> 04:55.722
I didn't have enough time or trust
or faith.

04:55.747 --> 04:58.370
Jack didn't understand like Kate.

05:00.766 --> 05:02.865
So, what do you think about
what Kate is doing here?

05:02.890 --> 05:04.750
I think this documentary is a great thing

05:04.775 --> 05:06.257
People need to know what happened.

05:06.282 --> 05:07.902
No, not the documentary.

05:07.927 --> 05:11.923
I mean, what do you think about
Kate becoming possess herself.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.662
What?

05:15.747 --> 05:18.201
What are you talking about?
How can she even do that?

05:18.226 --> 05:20.789
Well.
We're going to find out.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.962
Are you all out of your minds?

05:22.987 --> 05:25.013
Look, even if this were possible.

05:25.038 --> 05:27.527
you saw what that demon
did to Kate's husband.

05:27.552 --> 05:30.593
Not to mention all the other poor souls.

05:30.618 --> 05:32.122
- This isn't a game.
- Look.

05:32.147 --> 05:35.085
You and I both know that
nothing is going to happen.

05:35.516 --> 05:38.277
You do not even realise what
you're getting involve with,

05:38.302 --> 05:40.526
what's at risk, son.

05:41.151 --> 05:43.168
It's a good TV.

05:43.193 --> 05:45.654
I can't be a part of this.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.736
Please.
Leave my house.

05:47.761 --> 05:50.090
- One more question.
- Get out!

05:50.115 --> 05:54.192
If you're smart, you stop
this before it's too late.

05:58.116 --> 05:59.804
I'm going to say it.

05:59.829 --> 06:01.408
Say what?

06:01.433 --> 06:04.563
You just got us kicked
out of a priest's house.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.002
How's that even happened?

06:06.027 --> 06:08.233
Priests are the most
forgiving people on Earth.

06:08.258 --> 06:11.612
He's not a priest anymore, remember.
He was excommunicated.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.449
Still, we'll be going
straight to hell for that.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.291
No way.
Not on my own.

06:16.316 --> 06:18.568
I'm bring you all with me.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.702
Speaking of which.

06:20.727 --> 06:24.489
I really appreciate.
I really appreciate you getting me this job.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.811
Come on, Sty.
You don't have to thank me for that.

06:26.836 --> 06:29.432
I know,
but I needed it.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.125
The money, you know.

06:31.150 --> 06:35.921
Hey. There's no one I rather
go to hell with than you guy.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.397
Kate Winter's Home

06:41.293 --> 06:44.608
- Is this how the stars do it?
- Of course.

06:44.653 --> 06:47.642
So.
Where exactly are we?

06:47.667 --> 06:50.069
This is Jesse's bedroom.

06:50.234 --> 06:54.309
He was so sick,
especially at the end.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.202
There are a lot of
bad memories in here.

06:57.714 --> 06:59.909
I can't believe I'm in
the Butcher's bedroom.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.006
- What did you say?
- The butcher.

07:02.031 --> 07:03.290
That's what the media called him.

07:03.315 --> 07:05.073
Don't you ever say that again.

07:05.098 --> 07:06.440
- That's my son we're talking about.
- I'm sorry.

07:06.465 --> 07:07.803
You got it?

07:07.828 --> 07:10.316
Yeah, sure.
You're the boss.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.696
Alright.
Follow me.

07:20.528 --> 07:23.471
Oh, hey.
Where do you want this equipment?

07:23.496 --> 07:25.719
Put the equipment in here.

07:26.065 --> 07:28.486
My room is down the hall.

07:32.529 --> 07:35.146
- Ms. Winters, can I have a moment.
- Sure.

07:35.171 --> 07:36.784
Dr. Ben Hatcher
PSYCHYATRIST CENTRAL UNIVERSITY

07:36.809 --> 07:38.905
This is Dr. Ben Hatcher

07:38.930 --> 07:42.333
He is a psychiatrist I hired
to prove I'm not crazy.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.765
Do you have to
film me right now?

07:51.195 --> 07:54.337
As a matter of fact, Dr. Hatcher,
I do.

07:54.362 --> 07:57.696
From this point forward,
everything has to be filmed.

07:58.012 --> 08:00.027
What if I object?

08:00.544 --> 08:02.731
Then I'll replace you.

08:03.740 --> 08:07.597
You sought me out, Ms. Winters,
not the other way around.

08:07.622 --> 08:09.171
Yes, I did.

08:09.196 --> 08:11.899
But the footage comes first.

08:13.814 --> 08:16.597
Hey, uh. Where do you
want me to put these cameras?

08:16.622 --> 08:18.053
Hey, Joey.
Give him a hand.

08:18.078 --> 08:20.346
Put them up where
I showed you earlier.

08:26.637 --> 08:29.134
- What's this?
- Legal releases.

08:29.159 --> 08:32.291
Sign,
and have you assistants sign as well.

08:32.316 --> 08:33.902
Why?

08:34.078 --> 08:37.438
So, if something goes wrong,
you don't sue the hospital.

08:37.464 --> 08:39.279
Or Ms. Winters.

08:39.304 --> 08:41.096
Or me.

08:42.234 --> 08:44.701
Dr. Hatcher,
where does all this go?

08:44.726 --> 08:47.760
Down that hallway, turn left.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:28.735 --> 09:31.970
- Do you like the music?
- Yes, it's nice.

09:31.994 --> 09:34.333
It was Jesse's favorite.

09:36.281 --> 09:38.179
Can you tell me
what I'm looking at here?

09:38.204 --> 09:43.040
I'm going to use these items
to summon a demon to possess me.

09:43.065 --> 09:45.315
You're sure this is going to work?

09:45.564 --> 09:47.610
Absolutely

09:48.143 --> 09:50.184
Done my research.

09:50.209 --> 09:51.867
It's going to work.

09:51.953 --> 09:55.371
Can you give us an idea
what to expect when you do this.

09:55.974 --> 09:58.688
The same thing
that happened to Jesse.

09:59.749 --> 10:01.426
I can't believe you're so calm.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.701
I'll be terrified if I were you.

10:03.757 --> 10:05.416
- Do you have any children?
- No.

10:05.441 --> 10:06.829
Then you wouldn't know
what it's like

10:06.854 --> 10:10.177
to have the world labeled
your only son a monster.

10:10.769 --> 10:13.771
Did you read what they say
about me in the papers?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.931
And then they celebrated
when they executed a child.

10:16.956 --> 10:18.484
I thought Jesse was 18.

10:18.509 --> 10:20.688
He was my son.

10:20.713 --> 10:23.696
If I can prove that
a demon can possess me,

10:23.721 --> 10:28.167
then the would will have to accept
that my Jesse was innocent.

10:28.442 --> 10:30.445
I think we're done here.

10:36.405 --> 10:39.008
What a creepy fucking kid.

10:39.656 --> 10:42.049
Looks like a killer to me.

10:52.825 --> 10:55.079
This is exciting.

10:55.349 --> 10:57.788
Yeah.
Sure.

10:58.886 --> 11:00.690
It's exciting.

11:04.935 --> 11:07.145
Fucking eccentric.

11:07.707 --> 11:09.779
Eww.
What the hell is this?

11:09.804 --> 11:12.627
- Who told you to open that?
- This is a biohazard.

11:12.652 --> 11:16.427
Do you have any idea how unsanitary
it is to keep this in the kitchen?

11:16.452 --> 11:19.010
Never mind why you have it
in the first place.

11:19.035 --> 11:22.804
- Don't worry, it's not human.
- That's not the point.

11:30.299 --> 11:31.909
What are you doing?

11:32.808 --> 11:34.730
I don't want to talk about it.

11:35.037 --> 11:38.591
Dr. Hatcher.
We're ready for the interview.

11:48.183 --> 11:50.778
Jesse had a very tragic story.

11:50.803 --> 11:53.288
He should not have been
sentenced to death.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.349
He had a mental illness.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.946
You don't believe
he was possessed.

11:56.971 --> 11:59.329
No.
I do not.

11:59.354 --> 12:01.780
If you don't believe Kate's story,
then what are you doing here?

12:01.805 --> 12:06.559
Ms. Winters hired me as a consultant to lend
some credibility to this undertaking of her's.

12:06.584 --> 12:09.546
I'm going to monitor her
mental and physical health

12:09.571 --> 12:12.311
- Why?
- Simply put.

12:12.336 --> 12:17.214
It's my job to determine whether or not
Ms. Winters can be possess by a demon,

12:17.252 --> 12:19.462
or if she is in need of actual therapy

12:19.487 --> 12:22.452
What are the odds that
something happens to Kate?

12:22.477 --> 12:24.853
Nothing is going to happen to her.

12:24.878 --> 12:29.095
I suspect she's currently suffering
from a mild level chronic depression.

12:29.127 --> 12:32.679
This is why she is using her
religious fantasy as a crutch.

12:32.704 --> 12:36.964
It's my hope that going through this
experience we can get her pass this,

12:36.989 --> 12:38.681
and get her off this crutch.

12:38.706 --> 12:41.571
Tell me a little about
your qualifications, Ben.

12:41.596 --> 12:46.338
I'm a psychiatrist and a professor in the
department of medicine at Central University.

12:46.363 --> 12:48.354
You're also an author.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.556
Can I get an autograph?

12:52.002 --> 12:54.711
Done your research on me.

12:54.736 --> 12:57.057
Yes, I have written a book.

12:57.313 --> 12:59.425
And was it a best seller?

12:59.450 --> 13:02.450
It did okay.
It's more of an academic textbook.

13:02.475 --> 13:08.705
Academic? You try to disprove the
existence of God, miracle, demonic possession.

13:08.730 --> 13:12.535
- It doesn't sound academic to me.
- You're over simplifying.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.287
In my book, I wrote about several
cases studies where some supernatural behavior

13:16.312 --> 13:19.020
was really just a
manifestation of mental illness.

13:19.045 --> 13:22.445
So, yes.
It is an academic book.

13:22.470 --> 13:26.855
Faith and religion are the
last lies of an insane world.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.940
In it's quest for true understanding,

13:28.965 --> 13:33.042
humanity has to abandon the monsters
under the bed and the angels in the sky.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.471
What's your point?

13:34.496 --> 13:38.684
Those are pretty strong words
especially for a former priest.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.145
I was never ordained.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.713
What happened?
Why did you lose your faith?

13:42.738 --> 13:48.636
My faith isn't relevant. My scientific expertise
is the only thing that matters here.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.063
Well, I disagree. I
think it's all relevant.

13:51.088 --> 13:54.565
I'm here to certify Ms. Winters
is mental sound.

13:54.590 --> 13:57.865
And that is the only thing
you and I are going to discuss.

13:57.890 --> 14:01.264
The rest of my life
is non of your business.

14:01.289 --> 14:03.676
I see why she wanted
you for the job.

14:03.701 --> 14:06.635
I'm glad my resume
meets your approval.

14:15.342 --> 14:18.480
So. Have you guys made
anything I might have seen?

14:18.505 --> 14:19.735
'Ghost chasers ".

14:19.760 --> 14:21.771
- Is that on TV?
- Used to be.

14:21.796 --> 14:23.365
Well, that's too bad.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.831
Yeah. Producers were
a bunch of amateurs.

14:25.856 --> 14:28.065
It's so good,
it could put insomniacs to sleep.

14:28.090 --> 14:31.369
Oh. I guarantee this
project will be memorable.

14:31.394 --> 14:33.816
- It already is.
- Enjoy the food.

14:33.841 --> 14:36.436
If there is anything else you need,
just let me know.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.540
Ms. Winters, aren't you
going to eat anything?

14:38.565 --> 14:42.214
Oh, no. I can't eat anything
before the ceremony tonight.

14:42.498 --> 14:46.037
- You want to do that tonight?
- Well, at 3 AM.

14:46.550 --> 14:50.201
I have to get a blood sample.
I need a baseline psychiatric profile.

14:50.226 --> 14:52.097
So, let's get it.

14:52.816 --> 14:54.308
Okay.

14:56.405 --> 14:59.505
I got it.
You just finish your dinner.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.854
You know, Sarah.
You have a nice face, for a camera.

15:05.879 --> 15:08.339
- Thank you.
- Any interest in acting?

15:08.364 --> 15:10.018
No.

16:05.022 --> 16:06.716
Alright, Kate.

16:06.741 --> 16:08.448
I'm going to ask you a series
of questions

16:08.473 --> 16:11.935
to measure a baseline brain functions
and cognitive awareness.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.442
Okay.

16:13.467 --> 16:15.570
Can you tell me what
you're drawing right now?

16:15.595 --> 16:19.305
Symbols that will allow me
to summon a demon.

16:19.330 --> 16:23.238
- What is your full name?
- Catherine Elizabeth Winters.

16:23.970 --> 16:28.285
- And where are you right now?
- In my house, my bedroom.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.715
What is your earliest memory?

16:31.603 --> 16:35.858
When I was 6, my father
took me to a Dodgers  game.

16:35.883 --> 16:38.025
You don't remember
anything before that?

16:38.050 --> 16:40.256
Not off the top of my head.

16:40.562 --> 16:42.510
Alright, Kate.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.229
As far as I can tell
you are mentally healthy.

16:46.558 --> 16:50.999
- Great. Let's get started with the ceremony.
- Okay, let's clear the room.

16:51.024 --> 16:53.130
No, you all must participate.

16:53.155 --> 16:56.343
Whoa, uh uh.
I did not sign up for this.

16:56.368 --> 17:00.088
You participate or you get out
of my house right now.

17:03.649 --> 17:07.805
You must all put your hands
on the altar.  Including you.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.797
Dark Lord.

17:33.822 --> 17:38.219
You humble servant,
Kate Winters

17:38.244 --> 17:40.485
awaits you.

17:40.510 --> 17:45.574
Dark Lord.
Judge me worthy.

17:45.736 --> 17:50.462
Judge my worth,
and convey to him, The Morning Star.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.467
He who binds the light.

17:53.492 --> 17:59.031
Dark Lord, judge me worthy.
I offer my soul to you.

18:02.161 --> 18:08.352
This is my offering, my body.
My body is yours.

18:08.377 --> 18:11.008
I am yours.

18:26.156 --> 18:29.308
Jimmy, listen.
I got some great footage, man.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.486
 It's amazing.

18:30.511 --> 18:32.793
She did the ceremony and she...

18:32.818 --> 18:37.034
she painted the walls with blood
and stabbed some animal heart.

18:37.059 --> 18:40.418
It's crazy.
This is some good stuff.

18:40.443 --> 18:43.587
I even ripped a few pages
from her creepy ass book.

18:43.612 --> 18:47.979
I was planning on faxing them to you.
So, let's talk numbers.

18:49.073 --> 18:52.562
No, that's a fucking price
for a Youtube video.

18:52.587 --> 18:55.549
This is real, man.
This is like an exclusive.

18:56.159 --> 18:59.336
Come on, man. How am I
suppose to pay these guys?

18:59.361 --> 19:00.904
No.
If you don't pay me,

19:00.929 --> 19:03.371
how in hell am I
suppose to pay them?

19:03.396 --> 19:05.440
No, I know but...
Hello?

19:05.465 --> 19:07.897
Hello?
Jimmy!

19:08.263 --> 19:09.963
Shit!

19:15.127 --> 19:18.337
Hey.
Can I get you to come inside?

19:37.527 --> 19:40.680
- Is there any alcohol in here?
- No.

19:40.705 --> 19:43.049
Give me the keys. I'm going
to get something to drink.

19:43.074 --> 19:45.206
Why?
So you can wreck my car again?

19:45.230 --> 19:47.956
Jesus Christ, man. What the
hell have you got me into?

19:47.981 --> 19:53.028
Stu, I got you a job that’s
going to solve all your problems.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.591
I showered twice
and I still feel gross.

19:55.616 --> 19:57.895
Yeah, and never tell me about it.

19:59.143 --> 20:01.642
Do you want to get out of here?
I was going to get a drink, maybe.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.438
I don't know.
You guys going out?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.126
No, I'm going to bed.

20:05.151 --> 20:08.454
Yeah, I probably should to.
I got an early morning.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.046
You are a fucking cock block,
you know that?

20:16.558 --> 20:18.316
Good night, Stu.

20:54.398 --> 20:56.121
Day 2
Dec 12th 2010

20:56.157 --> 20:58.026
How was your night?

20:59.665 --> 21:03.590
Not good.
It was unfortunately quiet.

21:03.615 --> 21:05.333
What did you expect to happen?

21:05.358 --> 21:08.724
I expected this morning that
you should be talking to a demon.

21:09.255 --> 21:12.885
- Why is it so important you become possess?
- I don't know what I could have done wrong!

21:12.910 --> 21:15.704
I did everything I was suppose to.

21:15.729 --> 21:21.125
Isn't it more likely that
Jesse was in fact mentally ill,

21:21.150 --> 21:23.313
and that there was no demon.

21:23.338 --> 21:28.084
No. I have to figure this out.
I must have missed something.

21:28.124 --> 21:32.280
- Okay. Why don't you tell me about...
- We'll do this later.

21:32.305 --> 21:35.780
Kate.
Just one more minute, please.

21:36.602 --> 21:39.858
So,  Dr. Hatcher.
How was your night?

21:42.275 --> 21:44.160
So. How did you guys
sleep last night?

21:44.185 --> 21:47.422
- Like shit.
- I have fucking nightmare after nightmare.

21:47.447 --> 21:50.135
Yeah.
That stuff really got to me.

21:50.359 --> 21:54.305
My grandma once told me a story about
somebody who did something like this.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.753
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:57.168 --> 22:01.831
In her hometown in North Carolina.
Apparently she was some kind of witch.

22:01.971 --> 22:06.010
People she didn't like,
she just killed them, from a distance.

22:06.057 --> 22:09.756
With her mind, huh?
That's the the dumbest shit I ever heard.

22:09.781 --> 22:12.566
My grandma never lied.
It's true.

22:12.591 --> 22:16.121
She put a curse on them and then
they would die the next day.

22:16.146 --> 22:20.706
- Sounds like a small-town tall tale.
- Yeah. Maybe.

22:23.807 --> 22:26.118
Ha, ha.
It's funny.

22:27.886 --> 22:29.627
Stu, are you okay?

22:29.652 --> 22:30.731
Stu!

22:30.756 --> 22:32.724
- I think he's choking.
- Stu!

22:34.943 --> 22:36.658
Are you alright?

22:36.683 --> 22:38.665
Not funny.

22:39.165 --> 22:41.562
I was waiting for you to
give me mouth-to-mouth.

22:41.587 --> 22:43.551
Next time, I hope you really choke.

22:43.576 --> 22:46.320
Oh, come on.
It was just a joke.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.691
What?
Where are you going?

22:48.716 --> 22:52.308
Unlike you guys,
I have work to do.

22:54.896 --> 22:58.895
- That was funny, right?
- You're a real dumb ass, Stu.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.715
Come on.

23:01.349 --> 23:03.411
Oh, Jesse.

23:03.436 --> 23:06.672
I failed.
Why?

23:07.774 --> 23:10.557
- What's going on?
- She's just working thought something.

23:10.582 --> 23:14.882
- You're not going to stop her?
- No, she need to work through it.
- (Why? What else do I need to do!)

23:15.334 --> 23:16.876
Jesse.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.637
Can you help me.
I have to do this.

23:20.687 --> 23:22.375
Ha ha ha!

23:22.400 --> 23:26.732
What am I missing, Jesse?
What am I doing wrong?

23:26.757 --> 23:30.038
I have performed the ceremony.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.390
I said the god damn words!

23:32.415 --> 23:34.196
Kate, what are you doing?

23:34.221 --> 23:37.853
I don't know what I am doing wrong?
What am I missing?

23:37.878 --> 23:39.678
I wouldn't know.

23:39.933 --> 23:43.140
- That's it.
- What's it?

23:43.165 --> 23:45.153
He was sick.

23:45.293 --> 23:49.048
- Kate, are you okay?
- I am now.

23:49.714 --> 23:52.661
I just had to get that
out of my system.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.836
Thank you.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.018
- Is the door locked?
- Yes.

24:12.043 --> 24:14.357
Ben can't know about this, okay?

24:14.420 --> 24:17.903
If he knows I'm doing this to myself,
he would call me insane.

24:17.928 --> 24:20.193
And probably try
to have me committed.

24:20.218 --> 24:22.378
Don't even worry about it.

24:24.481 --> 24:29.368
I'm weakening my body
so that it will speed up the process.

24:29.393 --> 24:32.400
And then the damn thing
can take me.

24:40.591 --> 24:43.515
I want to ask you what happened
in Jesse's room this morning?

24:43.540 --> 24:46.239
I was just looking
for answers.

24:46.398 --> 24:48.697
I'm a little concern about you.

24:48.722 --> 24:51.570
I'm not confident we
should continue this.

24:51.803 --> 24:55.682
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- I don't like using that word.

24:56.033 --> 24:58.565
And what word would you use?

24:58.590 --> 25:00.471
Insane?

25:00.746 --> 25:07.930
Mental ill? Deranged?
Depressed? Confused?

25:07.955 --> 25:10.925
Do you feel any of those
words describe you?

25:11.904 --> 25:15.054
You remind me of my
poor dead husband.

25:15.079 --> 25:17.322
God bless his soul.

25:18.065 --> 25:23.171
You know, Jack was a doctor too.
He was brilliant.

25:23.196 --> 25:27.118
- You don't mention of him often.
- No, and I'm not going to.

25:27.468 --> 25:32.413
I don't need you to tell me I have
unresolved issues with my dead husband.

25:34.393 --> 25:36.101
Kate.

25:38.107 --> 25:40.381
I lost somebody once.

25:40.949 --> 25:44.129
She was, very close to me.

25:44.154 --> 25:46.268
It was hard.

25:46.725 --> 25:49.200
I felt a lot of anger.

25:49.225 --> 25:52.698
- Who was it?
- My sister.

25:52.723 --> 25:56.167
I remember Jesse
when they killed him.

25:56.192 --> 25:58.711
The look in his eye.

25:58.736 --> 26:02.515
When his veins
filled with potassium chloride.

26:02.540 --> 26:05.132
You know in the weeks
before he was executed,

26:05.157 --> 26:07.364
the demon wasn't in there anymore.

26:07.389 --> 26:10.062
And he didn't remember
what he had done.

26:11.142 --> 26:15.188
And he didn't know why
he was being executed.

26:15.650 --> 26:18.316
That's my memory of Jesse.

26:19.492 --> 26:23.862
But you have to grief,
and move on.

26:24.787 --> 26:28.198
God, why?
Why are you stop this?

26:28.223 --> 26:31.007
Why?
I did everything I was suppose to!

26:31.032 --> 26:34.928
Please! Please!
Just let the damn thing have me!

26:37.713 --> 26:41.489
- What happened?
- I don't know. The door just flew open.

26:42.051 --> 26:43.745
It must have just
been the wind.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.719
How the hell did
this blow over here?

26:45.744 --> 26:47.746
Is that how this is?

26:48.642 --> 26:49.950
Check the weather.

26:49.975 --> 26:53.400
I think there might be a big storm
blowing through today.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.022
It happened.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.861
Just clean this up.

27:12.925 --> 27:16.099
 So. Is this the weirdest thing
you've ever seen?

27:16.124 --> 27:17.893
Huh.
Hardly.

27:17.918 --> 27:23.194
I once monitored a homicidal sleepwalker.
That shit was terrible.

27:23.219 --> 27:27.062
Yeah. We were once on a shoot where
this guy claimed he could hear ghosts

27:27.087 --> 27:30.281
and they told him all
sorts of scary things.

27:30.306 --> 27:31.622
I don't believe in ghosts.

27:31.647 --> 27:34.400
Come on, Stu.
That guy was a pathological liar.

27:34.440 --> 27:39.886
Okay. Well. Maybe that one was a hoax,
but we have seen unexplainable things.

27:39.911 --> 27:42.011
We are witnessing one right now.

27:42.036 --> 27:47.292
Come on. All I'm saying is that,
I had a few ghostly encounters.

27:47.456 --> 27:52.516
Well, Stu.
I work in reality, not reality TV and...

27:52.557 --> 27:56.437
Since working for Dr. Hatcher,
I find more often than not,

27:56.462 --> 28:01.162
people claiming to see ghosts
have Avery real problem.

28:01.192 --> 28:08.228
Honestly, you show a lot of the same similarities
to a few very unfortunate patients I have treated.

28:08.289 --> 28:12.728
You might want to consider
a therapy after this study is done.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.509
I did... No, I don't think...
No, I...

28:16.534 --> 28:20.875
Relax.
I'm just messing with you.

28:28.553 --> 28:30.071
Not going to happen.

28:30.096 --> 28:32.961
It's going to happen.
I'm wearing her down.

28:40.843 --> 28:42.544
Father Tomlin?

28:42.569 --> 28:44.337
- I'm Dr. Ben Hatcher.
- Thanks for seeing me.

28:44.362 --> 28:46.117
Absolutely.

28:50.743 --> 28:52.900
Now, I don't meant to be rude.

28:52.925 --> 28:56.310
But I'm not sure that it's a good idea
for you to see Kate right now.

28:56.567 --> 29:00.277
I know what Kate is trying to do.
I just can't ignore it.

29:01.763 --> 29:05.401
Everyone has their own processes,
when it comes to grieving

29:06.855 --> 29:09.813
<i>I'm not talking about this documentary.</i>

29:09.838 --> 29:14.281
I'm talking about Kate's soul,
about her trying to become possess.

29:14.306 --> 29:16.981
I understand your believes, Father.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.101
But at this point of her therapy,

29:19.126 --> 29:21.563
this is exactly what she needs
to be separated from.

29:21.587 --> 29:23.594
- Yes. But, you don't understand.
- What are you doing here?
- What do you want?

29:23.619 --> 29:25.486
- Kate.
- What is he doing here?

29:25.511 --> 29:28.040
You know, you need to leave
or you will ruin everything!

29:28.065 --> 29:29.985
Kate. I came here to stop you
from doing this.

29:30.010 --> 29:31.646
Why would you stop me?

29:31.671 --> 29:34.083
Don't you understand
this is all we have left?

29:34.103 --> 29:36.850
This is the only way that
the church will accept you back.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.650
I don't care about that anymore, Kate.

29:39.675 --> 29:41.393
Don't you realize
what you're risking?

29:41.418 --> 29:43.735
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.295
Because it's done.
The ceremony is done.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.633
This won't bring Jesse back.

29:48.665 --> 29:50.796
- There's nothing you can do.
- You're wrong.

29:50.821 --> 29:54.400
Because if I succeed, then the world
will have to  believe me.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.432
The world doesn't care.

29:56.457 --> 29:57.645
- Get out!
- Hey.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.867
- Get out!
- Hey.

29:58.892 --> 30:01.439
You get the fuck out of my house!

30:04.054 --> 30:06.713
You all are in so much danger
and you don't realize it.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.977
When you come to me for help,
pray it won't be too late.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.933
Get out!

30:19.721 --> 30:22.001
Just leave her alone.

30:22.581 --> 30:24.910
She needs to be alone right now.

30:25.035 --> 30:28.094
Get the damn thing
out of my face.

30:33.094 --> 30:36.189
- This could get out of hand quickly.
- Yeah, I saw that.

30:37.264 --> 30:41.656
I didn't know that she would be prone to hysteria.
She could become violent.

30:42.484 --> 30:45.816
- Where is the sedation kit?
- I'll go get it now.

31:37.406 --> 31:40.175
- What' going on?
- What's happening?

31:40.553 --> 31:42.464
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

31:42.489 --> 31:45.025
- The door won't open.
- Is there a key?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.856
It's not locked,
it just won't open.

31:47.896 --> 31:51.428
I want to see the footage from this room
first thing in the morning.

31:51.817 --> 31:55.280
Kate, open the door!
Please.

32:01.953 --> 32:05.094
Kate?
Kate?

32:10.518 --> 32:12.485
Are you okay?

32:13.049 --> 32:17.692
I feel wonderful.
It finally happened.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.912
Day 3

32:22.937 --> 32:28.246
Kate, what happened to your arms?
Did you do this to yourself?

32:28.271 --> 32:30.649
Don't be ridiculous.

32:31.670 --> 32:34.463
You know what, guys?
I think we're done here.

32:34.488 --> 32:36.627
I am considering emitting
you to the hospital.

32:36.652 --> 32:38.830
No, you don't decide
when this is over.

32:38.855 --> 32:41.107
Actually, I do.

32:41.132 --> 32:45.064
One phone call and the police will be here
to escort you to the hospital.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.091
You just try it and
see what happens.

32:47.116 --> 32:48.436
We're not going to stop
just because you...

32:48.461 --> 32:51.778
Excuse me,
I'm talking to my patient.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.283
Dr. Hatcher?

32:53.308 --> 32:55.832
- Yes, what is it?
- You need to take a look at this.

33:00.294 --> 33:02.074
That's not right.

33:03.494 --> 33:06.704
- Has anyone tempered with this equipment?
- Of course not.

33:06.729 --> 33:08.625
What's going on?

33:10.465 --> 33:12.737
The machine is not
recording your heartbeat.

33:12.762 --> 33:14.392
Demons don't have heartbeats.

33:14.417 --> 33:16.400
Don't be ridiculous.

33:16.425 --> 33:18.844
- Do we have an extra monitor?
- No.

33:27.431 --> 33:28.698
What?

33:28.723 --> 33:30.955
Your don't have a heartbeat.

33:31.466 --> 33:34.461
I'm going to call Sam about
getting some new equipment.

33:34.670 --> 33:37.891
Eddie, I would like to
speak to you in private.

33:41.696 --> 33:43.170
What kind of game
are you playing?

33:43.195 --> 33:45.429
Game? What the hell
are you talking about?

33:45.454 --> 33:47.360
You think this is a joke?

33:47.385 --> 33:48.626
Oh, I see.

33:48.651 --> 33:52.056
Have you run into something you can't explain
with your fancy medical degree?

33:52.081 --> 33:55.099
Ben. Can I have you
back in here, please.

33:55.893 --> 33:58.193
We are not through here.

34:01.726 --> 34:03.514
It's normal.

34:16.004 --> 34:21.089
Exactly.
Everything is normal.

34:21.114 --> 34:23.257
What was it like?

34:23.282 --> 34:26.155
- What?
- The possession.

34:26.179 --> 34:30.634
You said that the demon came last night.
What was it like?

34:31.134 --> 34:34.000
It's like being touched by fire.

34:34.502 --> 34:36.768
Where's the demon now?

34:39.420 --> 34:41.617
Inside of me.

34:45.560 --> 34:50.467
I don't feel good.
I need to lie down.

34:50.926 --> 34:52.915
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.501
I just need to lie down.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.282
I know you can't get this on camera,
but believe me the smell is disgusting.

35:06.307 --> 35:07.791
I don't understand.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.788
How can all the food
go bad all at once?

35:09.813 --> 35:11.711
No clue.

35:12.364 --> 35:14.157
It was fine yesterday.

35:14.182 --> 35:17.275
You know what?
I'll finish this up.

35:17.458 --> 35:21.422
Sarah. Why don't you go
get some groceries.

35:21.447 --> 35:24.954
- Are you sure?
- Here.

35:25.888 --> 35:27.867
I'll go with you.

35:28.703 --> 35:30.756
Help you carry the bags.

35:31.061 --> 35:33.767
Okay, sure.

35:38.629 --> 35:41.818
Like I said.
She's a peach.

35:45.734 --> 35:47.878
So. What's going on with Kate?

35:48.577 --> 35:50.569
She's a little warm.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.549
What does that mean?

35:53.651 --> 35:56.138
It means she has a fever.

35:56.438 --> 35:57.800
I hope she is up soon.

35:57.825 --> 36:01.744
Sicken pigeons ain't as interesting
as satanic symbols on the wall.

36:07.945 --> 36:10.251
You're crazy, Stu.

36:10.692 --> 36:12.894
It's a true story.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.646
What did you all get?

36:16.471 --> 36:20.724
Some fruit and stuff,
a peach for one.

36:39.868 --> 36:42.262
I can see your cards.

36:42.875 --> 36:45.142
It doesn't matter.
You suck at poker.

36:45.167 --> 36:48.368
Oh, yeah. Well, it
doesn't matter, because

36:48.393 --> 36:51.919
this pot is coming home
with me.

36:51.944 --> 36:54.501
Ah.
Shit.

36:55.227 --> 36:58.020
I am a poker god.

36:58.248 --> 37:00.809
You really are a shitty winner.

37:01.446 --> 37:04.659
Alright.
Deuces wild and two down.

37:12.607 --> 37:14.288
Deal me in.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.168
Deal me in.

37:18.706 --> 37:20.242
Okay, sure.

37:26.989 --> 37:29.066
Aren't you going to
look at your cards?

37:29.091 --> 37:32.302
No.
I know what they are.

37:34.230 --> 37:39.271
- 3 of clubs, King of diamonds.
- Yeah, right.

37:45.528 --> 37:47.714
Okay.
Try that again.

37:49.765 --> 37:52.307
Jack of hearts♥

37:53.159 --> 37:54.928
Lucky.

37:55.971 --> 37:58.727
Queen of diamonds.

37:59.349 --> 38:00.824
Damn.

38:01.995 --> 38:05.248
6 of hearts ♥

38:07.512 --> 38:10.150
5 of spades.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.282
Nice trick.

38:13.007 --> 38:15.157
2 of clubs.

38:15.719 --> 38:17.126
No.

38:17.401 --> 38:18.801
2 of clubs.

38:18.826 --> 38:20.767
No, you got it wrong.

38:20.792 --> 38:23.685
- That card is the 2 of clubs.
- It isn't.

38:23.951 --> 38:26.779
- You're lying, Stu.
- I'm not.

38:29.432 --> 38:33.029
Are you trying to make
a fool of me?  Huh?

38:33.054 --> 38:36.716
You think this is your big break,
you piece of shit.

38:38.502 --> 38:41.253
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of here. I'm leaving.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.925
Wherever you go,
they'll find you.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.258
What the fuck
are you talking about?

38:46.283 --> 38:48.298
Your gambling debts.

38:48.323 --> 38:49.714
How'd you knew about that?

38:49.739 --> 38:50.605
Okay.

38:50.630 --> 38:53.616
- How much are you in for?
- I think we have enough for one night.

38:53.641 --> 38:56.038
- You don't have... You have no idea...
- Stu, calm down.

38:56.062 --> 38:57.364
You told her, didn't you?

38:57.389 --> 38:58.981
Of course not.
Come on, man.

38:59.006 --> 39:02.458
This is bullshit.
This is fucking bullshit!

39:03.437 --> 39:04.995
So, Ben.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.344
- Tell me about your sister.
- What?

39:08.369 --> 39:13.708
You heard me.
How did your sister kill herself?

39:14.380 --> 39:18.478
Oh, by the way. You might just
want to go ahead and fuck Stu.

39:18.503 --> 39:20.790
Because it's all he thinks about.

39:20.815 --> 39:23.815
And he really can't do
very well at his job.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.260
Kate, we should get you to bed.

39:26.288 --> 39:29.259
- You know, suicide is a sin.
- Kate.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.151
- Don't you, altar boy.
- Stop this.

39:32.176 --> 39:34.405
You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

39:34.430 --> 39:36.409
Kate, enough.

39:39.171 --> 39:41.584
I don't-I don't feel right.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.087
Maybe we would just go?

39:50.112 --> 39:51.291
No.

39:51.316 --> 39:55.296
If they are playing a joke on us,
this is a waste of our time.

39:55.738 --> 39:57.992
I don't know if it's a joke.

39:58.017 --> 40:01.622
If that woman really needs my help,
we need to stay.

40:01.647 --> 40:04.991
 We can't just leave her alone
with these vultures.

40:05.049 --> 40:09.541
- What if she's in on it?
- No, she is not in on it.

40:09.566 --> 40:12.783
They're indulging her,
feeding her fantasy.

40:12.808 --> 40:15.256
Then, why don't we
just get rid of them?

40:15.281 --> 40:19.402
One reason I'm not getting rid of them
right now is what it would do to Kate.

40:19.427 --> 40:22.191
She needs to move
past Jesse's death.

40:22.216 --> 40:25.741
This whole thing
is part of that process.

40:31.778 --> 40:33.386
What's Kate?

40:33.411 --> 40:35.049
She's sleeping.
What do you want?

40:35.074 --> 40:37.492
I got proof she ain't crazy.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.213
- Really?
- Show him, Stu.

40:46.279 --> 40:48.161
Crazy, right?

40:48.847 --> 40:51.790
- Let me ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

40:53.296 --> 40:56.673
- How stupid do you think I am?
- You got to be fucking kidding me.

40:56.698 --> 40:58.812
What? You don't
believe your own eyes?

40:58.837 --> 41:02.213
No.
I don't believe you.

41:02.238 --> 41:05.425
You don't believe me. Then,
what do you think is going on?

41:05.450 --> 41:10.286
I think you are taking advantage of that
poor woman with your stupid parlor tricks.

41:10.326 --> 41:12.564
She is clearly mentally ill.

41:12.589 --> 41:17.064
So that makes your little magic show
not only unethical, it's illegal.

41:17.089 --> 41:18.286
Hey, you know...

41:18.311 --> 41:19.760
When this is all done.

41:19.785 --> 41:22.449
I'm going to have the police
confiscate your footage.

41:22.474 --> 41:24.824
And I'm pressing charges.

41:26.601 --> 41:28.455
We're not dealing with
a crazy woman anymore.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.237
- We're dealing with a fucking demon.
- Exactly.

41:31.262 --> 41:34.074
This is not a documentary about
the mother of the Butcher.

41:34.099 --> 41:37.811
- She was right. It was a demon.
- Eddie! He wants to send us to jail.

41:37.836 --> 41:39.098
Don't worry about it.

41:39.123 --> 41:41.180
No. No.
I'm done. I'm leaving.

41:41.205 --> 41:45.423
We can 100% prove that
the devil exist and you want to quit?

41:46.074 --> 41:49.810
You step one foot out of that door
and you're not getting a fucking dime.

41:49.928 --> 41:54.424
And when they come to collect,
I'm not going to bail you out.

41:55.884 --> 41:58.494
You are a son of a bitch,
you know that.

41:58.519 --> 42:00.582
Just looking out for you.

43:02.699 --> 43:04.859
Day 4

43:09.869 --> 43:13.186
- What's that?
- Rehydration fluid.

43:18.365 --> 43:22.741
- How are you feeling, Kate?
- Are you going to fuck him?

43:22.770 --> 43:24.023
Excuse me?

43:24.048 --> 43:26.976
You have a real soft spot
for losers, don't you.

43:27.001 --> 43:31.311
- I guess you're feeling better.
- Much.

43:31.989 --> 43:34.999
He calls you a peach.
You know that, right?

43:35.024 --> 43:37.679
- You heard him say that?
- Of course.

43:37.704 --> 43:41.408
Because you eat a peach real slow
and when you're done,

43:41.433 --> 43:44.144
drop it in the trash.
And Sarah.

43:44.169 --> 43:49.100
I appreciate it if you tell him to keep
his vulgar comments to himself.

43:54.255 --> 43:57.581
Ready to get this
legendary moment on camera?

44:04.525 --> 44:08.864
<i>Sarah, I want to feel my cock
in your mouth...</i>

44:08.889 --> 44:10.157
Ah.

44:12.775 --> 44:17.071
Don't ever come fucking near me again.
Any of you, you hear!

44:21.641 --> 44:22.959
So. How did it go?

44:23.001 --> 44:24.387
- Fuck off, man.
- Ha ha ha.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.134
Just turn the fucking camera off.

44:34.158 --> 44:36.295
Ben kicked us out.

44:38.163 --> 44:40.897
Go see what you can get
from outside.

44:43.835 --> 44:46.089
I want to ask you
a few questions.

44:46.114 --> 44:51.065
Quid pro quo.
You answer my question, I answer yours.

44:51.336 --> 44:52.893
Okay.

44:52.997 --> 44:56.650
Your sister's in hell,
you know that, right?

44:56.675 --> 44:59.261
- Is that you question?
- No.

44:59.286 --> 45:02.829
My question is,
do you miss her?

45:02.854 --> 45:04.577
Of course.

45:04.602 --> 45:09.047
She misses you.
She needed you, Ben.

45:09.072 --> 45:11.596
She called out for you
when she was dying.

45:11.621 --> 45:13.317
Okay, my turn.

45:13.345 --> 45:14.778
Shoot

45:15.112 --> 45:19.573
- Who am I talking to right now?
- Isn't it obvious?

45:19.598 --> 45:22.081
Why aren't you
answering my question.

45:21.706 --> 45:24.717
Do you really want me
to answer your question?

45:25.890 --> 45:29.000
Do you really want to know
who you're talking to?

45:29.025 --> 45:31.126
I don't think you do.

45:31.151 --> 45:34.951
Because if you knew
who I really was...

45:34.976 --> 45:39.796
... it would destroy that lie you
tell yourself that let you sleep at night.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.078
You know what I think, Kate?

45:44.559 --> 45:45.824
What?

45:46.638 --> 45:49.499
I think you want to believe
that you are possessed.

45:49.740 --> 45:53.913
Because if you're possessed,
your son is innocent.

45:54.664 --> 46:00.290
Oh, he was innocent, alright.
That's what made it so sweet.

46:00.496 --> 46:06.361
It was so much fun just to hear
him wailing and crying in prison.

46:06.804 --> 46:09.266
He was so confused.

46:09.291 --> 46:14.280
You know in prison they can corrupt the body
in ways you wouldn't even think were possible.

46:14.295 --> 46:16.781
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:16.806 --> 46:19.417
You want to know what
they did to him in prison?

46:19.442 --> 46:21.388
No.
I don't.

46:21.937 --> 46:26.864
- That can't be real.
- Un fucking believable.

46:26.975 --> 46:29.997
- How'd you guys do it?
- Do what?

46:30.022 --> 46:31.398
The paint.

46:31.423 --> 46:34.362
What're you talking about?
We didn't paint anything.

47:02.007 --> 47:05.427
- What are you doing?
- Moving on, Ben.

47:05.452 --> 47:08.723
- I'm done grieving.
- What do you mean?

47:12.193 --> 47:14.718
Just doing what you said.

47:22.296 --> 47:24.473
I want to talk to you, Eddie.

47:31.735 --> 47:34.462
It looked real.
It was coming from the painting.

47:34.487 --> 47:36.709
Are you sure it looked real?

47:36.940 --> 47:38.676
But, trust me,
it's not.

47:38.701 --> 47:42.350
It's a magic trick.
Okay?

47:45.547 --> 47:47.665
I like you, Eddie.

47:48.247 --> 47:50.964
And I want to make sure
this little project of yours

47:50.989 --> 47:53.199
is everything you want it to be.

47:53.224 --> 47:54.686
Thanks, Kate.
I appreciate that.

47:54.742 --> 47:58.719
Don't call me Kate.
You know I'm not Kate.

47:58.744 --> 47:59.887
Okay, sure.

47:59.912 --> 48:02.539
I've been talking to a few
colleagues at the hospital.

48:02.564 --> 48:06.285
Kate is clearly developing
some kind of delusional disorder.

48:06.310 --> 48:09.369
- We need to commit her.
- Okay. When?

48:09.394 --> 48:10.986
Tomorrow morning.

48:11.678 --> 48:17.187
You just keep the cameras rolling and
I'll promise I won't harm a hair on you head.

48:17.212 --> 48:19.117
- Deal?
- Deal.

48:19.142 --> 48:23.439
Excellent.
Here's to good TV.

50:31.355 --> 50:32.493
What's going on?

50:32.518 --> 50:36.043
I need you to stay out of our way,
or this officer will arrest you.

50:36.068 --> 50:38.130
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

50:38.155 --> 50:40.292
Joey, Stu. Make sure
you get every bit of this.

50:40.317 --> 50:43.025
- You are not putting this on tape.
- The hell I'm not.

50:43.050 --> 50:44.552
You're about to violate
my civil rights.

50:44.577 --> 50:48.922
This isn't about you, you moron.
We're taking Kate to the hospital.

50:48.947 --> 50:50.371
What's the charge?

50:50.396 --> 50:52.647
Where is Sarah?
Sarah!

50:52.672 --> 50:55.696
Sarah, will you please help them
if they need assistance?

50:57.119 --> 51:00.820
Okay, Kate's outside.
You have the sedation kit?

51:01.424 --> 51:02.650
Thanks.

51:02.765 --> 51:04.447
Officer, I can handle this.

51:04.471 --> 51:06.916
But, please feel free to arrest
any of these gentlemen

51:06.941 --> 51:10.212
if they take 1 step
outside of that door.

51:18.368 --> 51:22.442
- Good morning, Ben.
- Good morning, Kate.

51:30.790 --> 51:32.724
What is she doing?

51:40.651 --> 51:44.630
Didn't your sister, Mia,
shoot herself in the head?

51:44.655 --> 51:49.090
Kate. We need to take you to
the hospital for further testing.

51:50.071 --> 51:55.826
Okay, you might as well.
It's already over.

51:59.594 --> 52:01.020
Get ready.

52:04.469 --> 52:05.904
Sarah!

52:11.051 --> 52:12.689
Sarah.

52:13.618 --> 52:16.968
- Put it down.
- I can't, Ben! I can't!

52:16.993 --> 52:19.299
She's in my head! Get
her out of my head!

52:19.324 --> 52:21.631
Just put the gun down.

52:21.656 --> 52:24.962
- Can we talk about it?
- No, it hurts. It hurts.

52:24.987 --> 52:28.424
I have to turn it off!
I have to turn it off.

52:28.449 --> 52:30.605
No, Sarah.

52:30.630 --> 52:31.810
No.

52:31.893 --> 52:33.268
NO!

52:50.205 --> 52:52.259
Okay, guys.

52:53.991 --> 52:55.861
We need to go.

52:57.534 --> 52:59.003
Come on.

53:06.812 --> 53:08.959
[WOODHAVEN]
CHURCH OF GOD

53:19.020 --> 53:21.609
Why don't we just
turn her to the cops?

53:21.907 --> 53:24.895
Because I don't want
more people to get killed.

53:25.177 --> 53:27.947
You really think
Tomlin can help her?

53:29.011 --> 53:31.664
I don't think anyone else can.

53:34.966 --> 53:36.958
So, you are a believer?

53:39.312 --> 53:42.188
Sarah would never
do that to herself.

53:53.670 --> 53:56.506
<font color="#cb9696">God
bless our
Home</font>

53:59.006 --> 54:03.600
- Who is it?
- It's Ben. Ben Hatcher.

54:14.881 --> 54:18.652
- So she succeeded?
- Yes.

54:19.929 --> 54:21.972
I warned you, son.

54:22.296 --> 54:23.841
I know.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.329
Can you help her?

54:27.254 --> 54:31.412
- Where is she?
- She's in the car.

54:32.617 --> 54:35.180
Okay, I'll prepare.

54:39.852 --> 54:43.236
Give me the camera.
You open it.

54:53.442 --> 54:55.389
Insurance.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.511
Okay, Joey.

55:00.478 --> 55:03.030
Hey? What, what!
Grab her.

55:04.670 --> 55:07.254
Joey.
Shit.

55:07.279 --> 55:09.443
- Shit. Joey.
- No, no, no, no.

55:13.387 --> 55:14.892
Shit.

55:17.803 --> 55:19.709
Untie me, Eddie.

55:20.246 --> 55:23.561
You said you just wanted me to film.
That was the deal.

55:23.586 --> 55:27.554
I'm going to enjoy peeling
the flesh from your bone.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.951
And I thought you were
going to let me live.

55:29.976 --> 55:32.059
That was before you disappoint me.

55:32.091 --> 55:33.757
In case you hadn't noticed.

55:33.782 --> 55:36.599
There is one and a half
priest in the next room.

55:36.624 --> 55:38.241
I have seen the movies.

55:38.266 --> 55:41.949
All I have to do is wait,
and I'll get my happy ending.

55:42.184 --> 55:44.399
Don't talk to her, Eddie.

55:44.859 --> 55:48.863
It about time, Father.
I've wanted to catch up.

55:49.070 --> 55:51.442
I'm glad you're filming this.

55:51.467 --> 55:53.665
No one would believe it
if we didn't have it on camera.

55:53.690 --> 55:55.827
I have something I
want to tell you, Ben.

55:55.852 --> 55:59.106
Kate's still here,
behind the body.

55:59.131 --> 56:04.181
Ben, please help me!
Ben, please. Please help me!

56:04.406 --> 56:07.880
Yes, tell them how he failed you.

56:09.262 --> 56:10.872
Oh!
You, son of a bitch!

56:10.897 --> 56:12.981
Everything has consequences, demon.

56:13.006 --> 56:15.769
I can't stand by while you
torment this child of God.

56:15.794 --> 56:17.374
I'm not tormenting her.

56:17.399 --> 56:19.823
I'm just raping her soul.

56:21.728 --> 56:23.298
No, I'll find your name.

56:23.323 --> 56:26.270
- Why does it matter?
- Every demon has it's weaknesses.

56:26.295 --> 56:28.779
We find it's name,
that's how we defeat it.

56:28.811 --> 56:31.374
I have no weaknesses, Father.

56:31.399 --> 56:35.472
No, you sound overconfident for
somebody strapped to a bed.

56:35.497 --> 56:37.277
Still doing therapy, Ben?

56:37.302 --> 56:40.600
What's your diagnosis?
Daddy issues?

56:45.209 --> 56:50.157
- It's obvious. Hubris is your weakness.
- Exactly, it thinks it knows everything.

56:50.182 --> 56:52.178
Well.
I'll tell you what I do know.

56:52.203 --> 56:54.933
I'm going to corrupt this body
and then this soul

56:54.958 --> 56:56.980
and you're going to watch,
helpless.

56:57.005 --> 56:59.758
In the name of Jesus Christ,
tell us your name!

56:59.783 --> 57:01.801
How about you just guess?

57:01.826 --> 57:05.434
Dominus imperat vobis.
(The Lord commands you.)
Tell us your name!

57:05.459 --> 57:07.848
The Lord commands you.

57:11.655 --> 57:14.229
You wish to know my name?

57:14.451 --> 57:16.593
Throughout time I have
collected many names.

57:16.618 --> 57:20.315
- The Lord commands you.
- Shut up!

57:20.340 --> 57:21.811
- Tell us your name.
- NO!

57:21.836 --> 57:23.956
- The Lord commands you.
- NO!

57:23.981 --> 57:25.390
The Lord commands you!

57:25.415 --> 57:26.750
Nooooo!

57:26.774 --> 57:28.799
The Lord commands you!

57:28.824 --> 57:31.408
TELL US YOUR NAME!

57:36.824 --> 57:39.426
You wish to know my name?

57:39.451 --> 57:42.914
Throughout time I have
collected many names.

57:43.014 --> 57:47.794
In this century, in this place,
you know me as Satan.

57:49.193 --> 57:51.723
But you know me as the Butcher.

57:52.647 --> 57:57.144
Last time you were excommunicated.
This time you'll die.

57:57.753 --> 58:01.681
Run away!
I know where I'll find you!

58:02.996 --> 58:04.891
What's going on?

58:06.187 --> 58:07.766
It's the same demon

58:07.791 --> 58:11.424
The same on who had Jesse.
The exact same one.

58:11.759 --> 58:15.005
- Maybe the thing was lying.
- You don't understand.

58:16.171 --> 58:18.894
It knows Kate.
Maybe that was Kate talking.

58:18.919 --> 58:20.290
No, you don't understand.

58:20.315 --> 58:24.341
- A demon can't lie about it's name.
- Why not?

58:26.779 --> 58:28.868
When god created the universe,

58:28.893 --> 58:31.838
he gave man dominion
over all of the angels.

58:31.863 --> 58:34.269
Satan is a fallen angel.

58:34.294 --> 58:38.268
We can command a demon even as
powerful as him to do our bidding.

58:38.293 --> 58:42.814
So, if we ask him
to reveal his name, he must.

58:43.658 --> 58:45.810
Oh god.

58:46.361 --> 58:48.331
Father Tomlin.

58:48.478 --> 58:51.115
You're the last remaining
hope for Kate.

58:51.541 --> 58:55.592
I have done what I could,
but I have reached my limits.

58:55.896 --> 58:58.645
Now, If you don't do
anything to help her,

58:58.670 --> 59:00.293
there is no one else who can.

59:00.318 --> 59:01.947
I think we should leave.

59:01.972 --> 59:04.090
- What?
- She committed murder, Ben.

59:04.115 --> 59:05.901
We have it on camera.
She needs to go to prison.

59:05.926 --> 59:08.087
That's not Kate.
Kate would never...

59:08.112 --> 59:09.969
How the hell do you know
what Kate would do?

59:09.994 --> 59:11.637
She's the one who
wanted to be possessed.

59:11.662 --> 59:13.799
Now I say,
she got what she wanted.

59:16.236 --> 59:19.268
We're not leaving
until this is over.

59:19.293 --> 59:21.823
- None of us!
- Whatever. Try and stop me.

59:21.848 --> 59:23.511
You don't get it, do you?

59:23.536 --> 59:27.047
There is no where you can go
where he won't find you.

59:28.129 --> 59:33.027
There is no escape from this!
Your coward!

59:33.409 --> 59:36.886
I can't believe he puts his
fucking hands on me, man. Fuck!

59:37.013 --> 59:39.497
Hell, no.
Uh uh.

59:39.588 --> 59:41.732
He ain't getting away
with that shit.

59:43.741 --> 59:45.877
I'm not going to die like this.
Fuck.

59:45.902 --> 59:48.638
Come on, Eddie.
Think, think, think, think, think.

59:50.633 --> 59:52.930
I wonder if this
fucking door is open.

01:00:13.057 --> 01:00:14.420
Hello, Eddie.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:17.978
- You're going to exorcise me on your own?
- No.

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:20.377
Then what do you want?

01:00:20.623 --> 01:00:22.794
I'm going to cut you loose.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:26.471
Know what?
I'm not going nowhere.

01:00:26.496 --> 01:00:30.323
- But you said you wanted me to untie you.
- That was then.

01:00:30.348 --> 01:00:32.141
If you want to get out of this,

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:34.850
your hands are going to
have to get a little dirty.

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:36.556
What do you want?

01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:40.371
Kill the priest,
and the good doctor too.

01:00:42.923 --> 01:00:45.948
- I can't.
- It's your choice.

01:00:45.973 --> 01:00:49.634
If you want to live,
you know what you have to do.

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:58.170
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:01.505
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

01:01:05.297 --> 01:01:06.847
Father?

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.229
I failed Jesse.

01:01:17.353 --> 01:01:21.722
In the name of god,
let's save Kate.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.581
That's my boy.

01:01:35.606 --> 01:01:38.400
Lord, have mercy.
Christ, have mercy.

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:42.317
God, the son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us all.

01:01:42.342 --> 01:01:44.184
- From all evil, deliver us, oh Lord.
- I can feel your fear.

01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:46.248
You're afraid.
I can feel your fear.

01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:50.571
Lord, save your servant, Kate.
I trust in you, oh Lord.

01:01:50.591 --> 01:01:54.778
I'm not Kate.
I am Lucifer, the Morning Star.

01:01:54.803 --> 01:01:59.115
You will remember my name forever.
For I shall burn it into your eyes.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.720
And you will wear it as brand for
all eternity as you rot in hellfire.

01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:04.951
What's happening?

01:02:04.976 --> 01:02:06.264
Don't worry, son.
The demon's afraid.

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.614
- He's trying to scare us.
- I'm not afraid.

01:02:08.639 --> 01:02:11.472
You are afraid.
You are a sorry to saintship.

01:02:11.497 --> 01:02:14.880
I was afraid, but I fear no longer.
God is my helper.

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.833
The Lord sustains my life.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.086
All 10 minutes is that
I'll laugh at your life.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:22.381
Then I'll personally defile
your soul for all eternity.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:26.908
Lord, save your servant, Kate.
Let the enemy have no power over her.

01:02:26.954 --> 01:02:29.492
And the son of iniquity
be powerless to harm her.

01:02:29.517 --> 01:02:31.607
It's no use, priest.

01:02:31.632 --> 01:02:36.018
Lord, send your aid from your
holy place and watch over her.

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:37.535
Lord, heed my prayer.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.940
It doesn't matter.

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:42.278
You will fail because you're
an insect before my power.

01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:44.719
You are nothing more
than an insect.

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:47.763
And he is coming and he
will return you to hell...

01:02:47.788 --> 01:02:48.899
Kill !

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:51.784
Kill ! Kill !
Ah!

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:53.862
I'm sorry, Ben.
I had to do it.

01:02:53.887 --> 01:02:55.699
No!

01:03:14.844 --> 01:03:17.392
What would Mia say if
she could see you like this?

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:19.174
Shut your mouth.

01:03:19.199 --> 01:03:23.353
- Suicide is a sin.
- Don't you fucking say another word.

01:03:23.378 --> 01:03:26.523
You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

01:03:28.882 --> 01:03:31.052
How could you do this?

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:41.157
A demon like me
is responsible for Mia too.

01:03:42.592 --> 01:03:47.628
- You're not going to win this.
- You can end it.

01:03:47.653 --> 01:03:50.731
Take the knife
and finish it.

01:03:53.978 --> 01:03:55.723
That's right...

01:03:57.851 --> 01:04:02.614
You heard me, old man.
There's no getting rid of me.

01:04:04.913 --> 01:04:07.141
What If I call the cops?

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:09.626
Sure, call the cops.

01:04:09.651 --> 01:04:14.027
There's nothing I like more than a
more bodies to rip apart.

01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:16.403
You can't escape everytime.

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:19.577
Eventually, you'll wind
up in jail, like Jesse.

01:04:19.602 --> 01:04:22.922
No, I won't.
Kate will.

01:04:22.947 --> 01:04:29.246
She will rot in the cell until they drag her
kicking and screaming to legal injection.

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:32.746
And I'll find someone else.

01:04:32.771 --> 01:04:36.326
There are far more
deserving souls in prison.

01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:43.280
Take the knife and finish this.
It's the only way to set Kate free.

01:04:44.482 --> 01:04:46.380
What's with you?

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.128
I can't murder you.

01:04:49.153 --> 01:04:54.723
What're you going to do now?
Sit around? Until this body rots?

01:04:57.566 --> 01:04:59.138
No.

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:02.590
No.

01:05:05.937 --> 01:05:10.268
When time began,
the word was there.

01:05:10.347 --> 01:05:13.216
And the word was
face to face with God.

01:05:13.241 --> 01:05:15.870
And the Word was God!

01:05:16.994 --> 01:05:19.045
Not this again.

01:05:19.158 --> 01:05:22.714
How about you untie me.
I got some place I need to be.

01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:23.929
Silence, demon.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:26.288
Oh!
Silence, demon!

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:29.098
You sound like Father Tomlin.

01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:32.369
I want you to take me.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.807
Excuse me.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:39.835
Can you think of a
better vessel to corrupt?

01:05:40.289 --> 01:05:43.643
Can you imagine how much power
you would have using my soul.

01:05:43.668 --> 01:05:47.593
You would do that for Kate
after everything she's done?

01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:51.194
I walk this path myself.

01:05:52.538 --> 01:05:54.820
I could have ended this.

01:05:56.677 --> 01:05:58.400
All of this.

01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.838
But I'm going to fix it.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:07.632
You don't know what you're asking.

01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:12.357
I command you to possess my soul.

01:06:19.674 --> 01:06:21.189
Ben?

01:06:27.064 --> 01:06:32.757
Oh, Ben. You poor fool.
You thought you could control me.

01:06:32.782 --> 01:06:38.333
Dr. Hatcher...
Gaze upon your first victim.

01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:42.696
The woman you sacrificed your soul for.

01:06:42.813 --> 01:06:45.718
You killed him!
You killed my baby!

01:06:45.743 --> 01:06:48.553
You killed my baby!

01:06:55.523 --> 01:06:57.015
Kate.

01:06:58.578 --> 01:07:02.412
Sorry, Ben.
It had to be done.

01:07:16.045 --> 01:07:18.063
That's the proof.

01:07:18.442 --> 01:07:23.019
To the families of those who were
hurt in order to make this video,

01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:26.701
Your loved ones were
martyred in truest sense.

01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:31.659
Their sacrifices made, so that
the world would know the truth.

01:07:31.684 --> 01:07:34.922
That my son Jesse, was innocent.

01:07:37.823 --> 01:07:41.464
The infamous Kate Winters' video
continues to make headlines tonight.

01:07:41.489 --> 01:07:44.570
State and federal law enforcement officials
are combing through the video

01:07:44.595 --> 01:07:47.001
to find out if the
gruesome footage is real,

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.368
and to determine if there have
been any other victims

01:07:49.393 --> 01:07:51.543
besides those depicted in the footage.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.802
Kate Winters, the mother of the
infamous serial killer, The Butcher,

01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:56.461
is wanted for questioning.

01:07:56.486 --> 01:07:59.077
But, so far there are no leads
as to her whereabouts.

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:01.055
Kerry Marshall has the story.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.057
I'm standing outside the now
vacant home of Kate Winters,

01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:05.454
mother of the Butcher.

01:08:05.479 --> 01:08:09.809
In week following the release of her
disturbing and violent documentary,

01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:12.011
no one has seen
nor heard from her.

01:08:12.036 --> 01:08:15.606
News team 8 took to the streets
to find out what do you think.

01:08:15.631 --> 01:08:18.484
I think it's real.
I just don't see how it could be fake.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:22.268
So, you believe that this is
definitive proof of the Devil?

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:25.856
Well. If the devil does exist, 
then he isn't hiding it.

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:28.986
She used to be such a 
wholesome community, right?

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:31.291
Are you concerned for
your family's safety?

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:34.185
Absolutely. I don't think the cops are 
doing near enough to find this woman.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:36.761
I mean, why is she still out there?
Why is she still on the loose?

01:08:36.786 --> 01:08:38.121
It is absolutely a fake.

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:40.407
Have you heard a little movie 
called "Paranormal Activity"?

01:08:40.432 --> 01:08:42.437
Because it's basically the same thing.

01:08:42.462 --> 01:08:46.231
Police have reported that the people
in the video are missing.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:48.749
So? That doesn't mean it's not 
some kind of elaborate prank.

01:08:48.774 --> 01:08:49.971
I mean,

01:08:49.997 --> 01:08:52.720
if you were going to kill a bunch of people, 
you wouldn't put it on camera..

01:08:52.746 --> 01:08:55.057
Do you think the 
Kate Winters' video is real?

01:08:55.082 --> 01:08:58.115
Oh, absolutely, I do.
Very much so.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.202
All of it? 
The murders, the supernatural part?

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:03.871
Absolutely. 
Let me read something to you,

01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:05.796
as from the Book of Revelation.

01:09:05.818 --> 01:09:07.501
And the fifth angel sounded,

01:09:07.526 --> 01:09:10.694
and I saw a star fallen from 
heaven unto the earth:

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.149
and to him was given 
the key to the bottomless pit.

01:09:14.175 --> 01:09:19.073
That's the beginning of the end times.
And we are there, we're in Revelation today.

01:09:19.098 --> 01:09:20.613
We're living it. 
We're breathing it.

01:09:20.639 --> 01:09:25.312
This video is real and it is the
beginning of something beautiful.

01:09:25.337 --> 01:09:26.716
My friends and I think it's real.

01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:29.863
I mean, her son killed all those people, 
why wouldn't she do it.

01:09:29.888 --> 01:09:33.810
At this point, we're not going to release 
a statement on an open investigation.

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:37.006
We can say that the footage 
is being analyzed very carefully.

01:09:37.032 --> 01:09:39.408
The people in the video
have been reported missing.

01:09:39.434 --> 01:09:44.528
We will exhaust all efforts to locate them 
before opening any type of investigation.

01:09:44.553 --> 01:09:48.200
We reached out to the local diocese 
of the Catholic Church for comment.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:50.975
But, so far have
received no response.

01:09:51.001 --> 01:09:53.216
For Channel 8 News,
I'm Kerry Marshall.

01:09:53.242 --> 01:09:54.627
Back to you, Graham.

01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:55.548
Thank you, Kerry.

01:09:55.573 --> 01:09:58.167
We'll have more for you
as the story unfolds.

01:09:58.192 --> 01:10:01.314
I'm Graham Ulkins, 
for Channel 8 News.
