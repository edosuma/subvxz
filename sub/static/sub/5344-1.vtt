00:29.703 --> 00:30.682
Death.

00:31.604 --> 00:33.148
Death is a funny business.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.633
Usually, people think it's

00:36.668 --> 00:38.851
being at the wrong place wrong time.

00:39.717 --> 00:41.113
In this story,

00:41.148 --> 00:44.686
it's about being in the right place the right time.

00:46.061 --> 00:48.602
But perhaps I speak too soon.

00:49.806 --> 00:51.425
It all started with bees.

00:52.366 --> 00:53.480
Mor.

00:53.515 --> 00:55.378
And no one knows why.

00:55.755 --> 00:59.388
Simply leave their hives and disappear.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.171
But why should we care bee?

01:06.032 --> 01:07.933
Bees pollinate our food.

01:08.555 --> 01:10.233
Once they disappear,

01:10.268 --> 01:12.300
we will not take any more.

01:13.637 --> 01:17.176
However, in our human world, Who has time to think about bees?

01:17.872 --> 01:20.529
When there are clearly some ...

01:20.564 --> 01:22.145
more serious problems to solve.

01:28.696 --> 01:31.576
Kaleb's art can be seen as deeply rooted in

01:31.611 --> 01:34.870
pop minimalism of Aureur or Baer.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.187
Continued ...

01:54.879 --> 01:56.724
I feel like I office.

01:58.154 --> 01:58.983
Daniel.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.314
- Eric, nice to see you. - Me too.

02:02.349 --> 02:03.258
- Hi. - Hi.

02:03.293 --> 02:04.519
How do you treat New York?

02:04.554 --> 02:06.816
I can not complain. I just bought an apartment

02:06.851 --> 02:09.392
Exceptionally four bedrooms in Tribeca, we're renovating,

02:09.426 --> 02:12.350
and yes, it's good.

02:12.385 --> 02:14.044
And how long will you stay in Berlin?

02:14.079 --> 02:15.849
A few more weeks, with this project.

02:16.827 --> 02:17.667
Good.

02:18.296 --> 02:19.390
So what do you think?

02:19.425 --> 02:22.230
I love that it's composition almost pictorial.

02:22.265 --> 02:24.472
My only anxiety e synchronization.

02:24.507 --> 02:27.277
I mean, if I go with him at the opening ...

02:27.312 --> 02:30.060
What might be to introduce you, you two can solve?

02:30.095 --> 02:30.932
Sure.

02:44.554 --> 02:45.498
I do not speak ...

02:45.533 --> 02:46.625
It's for my art blog.

02:46.660 --> 02:47.475
Good.

02:47.510 --> 02:49.072
It's great. Look.

02:49.107 --> 02:49.938
Oh God.

02:50.427 --> 02:52.818
Here, the link is on the card.

03:21.053 --> 03:23.474
Hey, Daniel, I think You should come down.

03:23.509 --> 03:25.318
We have a little problem here.

03:33.469 --> 03:36.645
We should not stop him?

03:38.116 --> 03:40.288
Can you calm down to We talk about it?

03:41.712 --> 03:43.067
I suppose not.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.301
For God's sake, Liam, stop.

03:46.336 --> 03:48.951
You know what? I do not give an exhibition for three years

03:48.986 --> 03:51.567
How long presentation that amateur Tetris games are.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.739
Kaleb is a wonderful digital artist.

03:53.774 --> 03:55.339
- Great? - Yes.

03:55.374 --> 03:57.896
It's shit done cerebral template.

03:57.931 --> 03:59.717
He has no heart.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.380
Ladies. I expected more from you.

04:02.415 --> 04:03.734
From me? Look at you.

04:03.769 --> 04:05.847
You are living dead.

04:05.882 --> 04:08.311
You must exit routine where you are.

04:08.346 --> 04:10.635
Routine? Not a routine.

04:10.670 --> 04:13.706
Working every minute in each day.

04:16.088 --> 04:18.189
People like you are the ones who ...

04:18.224 --> 04:20.291
Art is a product sale.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.704
But it's not.

04:21.738 --> 04:24.751
It is a process which needs time to be explored.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.764
Oh yes, your explorations. Your artistic integrity and ...

04:27.799 --> 04:29.317
I've never heard that before.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.232
And while you're in your process,

04:31.267 --> 04:34.069
What should I do to keep the lights on here?

04:34.104 --> 04:37.397
Look, Liam. I love you lot, you know.

04:37.432 --> 04:40.305
But sorry, not you sell things now.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.291
But I saw inverting it upside down.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.159
Your last exhibition was a mess, sorry.

04:47.194 --> 04:48.992
I said I was not ready for the exhibition,

04:49.027 --> 04:50.265
but you insisted.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.736
The art world has a short memory.

04:51.771 --> 04:54.060
I was trying to save you from become obsolete.

04:54.550 --> 04:57.843
And frankly, this character starving artist

04:57.878 --> 05:00.367
It is completely passive. You must be practical.

05:00.402 --> 05:02.099
What would you want me to do? Want to

05:02.134 --> 05:04.424
do a painting to hang one above the sofa?

05:04.459 --> 05:07.456
I never said we should. You have talent, yes?

05:07.491 --> 05:09.101
Nobody put this in doubt.

05:09.136 --> 05:12.081
We both know that talent go only up to a point

05:12.116 --> 05:13.520
in this profession.

05:15.723 --> 05:17.891
If that's true,

05:17.926 --> 05:19.890
I might as well to kill myself.

05:19.925 --> 05:21.600
Very dramatic, right?

05:21.635 --> 05:24.100
Why does everything have to be life and death to you?

05:24.135 --> 05:27.197
You are impossible. No time for that.

05:29.422 --> 05:30.316
Leave it there.

05:30.884 --> 05:33.488
Your client just asked me to exchange time.

05:33.523 --> 05:36.468
If a person still me asks a stupid question ...

05:36.503 --> 05:37.392
I finished.

05:37.427 --> 05:39.718
No, it's a misunderstanding, Kaleb. It's an understanding and can ...

05:39.753 --> 05:40.787
You know exactly what I mean.

05:40.822 --> 05:41.723
I do not know.

05:56.339 --> 05:57.496
What happens?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.031
A nothing.

05:59.066 --> 06:02.731
Only one of the artists Daniel, Liam Price.

06:02.766 --> 06:05.182
It was hard a few years ago but, you know ...

06:05.217 --> 06:08.075
It went through a tough time Lately

06:08.110 --> 06:10.513
and has become less miserable,

06:10.548 --> 06:12.917
but will be fine, trust me.

06:12.952 --> 06:15.273
It's just dramatic.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.669
Artists.

06:31.328 --> 06:34.469
Did you know that there are 250,000 words in English?

06:36.847 --> 06:38.941
It sounds like a lot, but

06:38.976 --> 06:39.791
I do not know.

06:40.293 --> 06:43.030
There are so many words great in other languages, which

06:43.065 --> 06:45.768
say things that we can say in English.

06:51.614 --> 06:53.206
What do you want to say?

06:55.235 --> 06:59.576
Nothing specific, but it's an interesting idea, right?

06:59.611 --> 07:01.439
For example, there are "tart"

07:01.474 --> 07:03.764
which means Scotland action to hesitate when

07:03.799 --> 07:06.774
introduce someone to that i forgot the name.

07:06.809 --> 07:08.244
Or "jayus"

07:08.279 --> 07:11.289
which in Indonesian means a joke so poorly told

07:11.324 --> 07:14.797
and so unfunny that you can not help but laugh.

07:14.832 --> 07:18.270
I feel that I miss so much speaking one language.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.516
Now I'm not working, should to learn German.

07:20.551 --> 07:23.767
Do not bother. Believe me, German

07:24.923 --> 07:27.431
It is an incredible language hard to learn.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.853
Or so I heard.

07:30.747 --> 07:31.968
Here's one for you.

07:33.539 --> 07:34.542
"CafunÃ©"

07:35.393 --> 07:38.970
The action of your walks tenderly fingers

07:39.005 --> 07:40.846
through someone's hair.

07:42.597 --> 07:43.660
Portuguese.

09:09.891 --> 09:10.753
Come Kunst.

09:21.912 --> 09:24.082
I found this book near the body.

09:25.168 --> 09:26.747
Liam's are, yes.

09:26.782 --> 09:28.618
Do you really think it's about suicide?

09:28.653 --> 09:30.781
You must be jumped Those rails.

09:30.816 --> 09:34.371
It must have been a miserable problem.

09:34.406 --> 09:37.272
Have a relative that should a contact?

09:37.307 --> 09:38.573
No, I know.

09:38.608 --> 09:40.862
When was the last time you spoke with Mr. Price?

09:41.864 --> 09:43.248
Yesterday.

09:43.283 --> 09:47.012
And he said something to give thought that he wanted to commit suicide?

09:47.047 --> 09:48.542
No more than usual.

09:48.577 --> 09:50.173
What exactly did he say?

09:50.208 --> 09:51.770
Well, sort of ...

09:53.384 --> 09:54.831
"I might as well to kill myself. "

09:54.866 --> 09:56.445
but you know, it's ...

09:57.697 --> 10:00.758
I apologize, but it does not you alarmed?

10:01.380 --> 10:04.265
There would even be a thing that to ignore him, right?

10:04.300 --> 10:05.914
Look, I work with artists.

10:05.949 --> 10:09.972
Being depressed is practical and dramatic the job description.

10:10.007 --> 10:11.420
If I take into account each ...

10:12.511 --> 10:14.071
I was his dealer,

10:14.106 --> 10:15.707
not shrink.

10:18.008 --> 10:18.808
That's it.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.742
Someone will have to come to identify the body.

10:44.568 --> 10:45.382
Excuse me.

10:46.504 --> 10:47.689
They are licensed in arts studio.

10:49.701 --> 10:51.525
Please, look at least.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.324
Is it?

11:08.359 --> 11:09.521
Yes.

11:09.556 --> 11:10.649
That's him.

11:10.684 --> 11:11.484
You sure?

11:12.301 --> 11:13.918
Please stop watching once.

11:13.953 --> 11:14.789
Again?

11:14.824 --> 11:15.666
Yes.

11:20.619 --> 11:21.457
Good.

11:22.285 --> 11:23.582
Thanks.

11:39.357 --> 11:41.218
Here are the rest of his things.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.163
Sorry gallery not yet open.

13:12.198 --> 13:14.061
I'm not here for the exhibition.

13:14.096 --> 13:15.705
One of your artists.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.315
The one who started the fire.

13:17.350 --> 13:19.630
Yes. Terrible.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.621
I stayed up all night looking at his pictures

13:21.656 --> 13:23.802
You have posted on the blog.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.384
Can I come in?

13:25.419 --> 13:28.483
I like that you've published notebook with sketches. It's so intimate.

13:28.518 --> 13:30.683
You got here? You could show me?

13:38.975 --> 13:40.423
Welcome.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.291
Daniel.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.569
Bring me a bottle of Belle Epoque 2004.

13:54.693 --> 13:55.746
Celebrate.

13:56.931 --> 14:00.823
Look, I do not know if that's Liam exactly what I wanted.

14:00.858 --> 14:03.474
That would any artist.

14:04.639 --> 14:07.817
Have you had sold all of his auction house here.

14:07.852 --> 14:08.870
It was a bad sale?

14:08.905 --> 14:10.543
You destroyed Arman.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.363
Get rid of all at once, I scared everybody.

14:13.796 --> 14:16.400
Look, let's not we anchor in the past.

14:16.435 --> 14:19.004
You can not buy Advertising like this.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.351
Daniel.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.580
Take inventory. Make a selection.

14:27.615 --> 14:31.338
Give an exhibition. And I'll buy a half.

14:35.644 --> 14:36.925
Recognize.

14:36.960 --> 14:41.510
Death was the smartest Liam's career move.

14:43.428 --> 14:45.047
It's fascinating, is not it?

14:45.082 --> 14:48.730
How tragic can give rise

14:48.765 --> 14:51.644
... such a beauty.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.619
Hello?

16:51.643 --> 16:53.072
What are you doing?

16:53.970 --> 16:55.435
What I do?

16:55.470 --> 16:56.900
What you do?

16:57.816 --> 16:58.935
You're not dead.

16:58.970 --> 17:01.573
What are you talking about? What do you want?

17:01.608 --> 17:04.063
Do not touch that! Do not touch anything!

17:04.098 --> 17:06.186
Where the hell have you been?

17:06.222 --> 17:08.276
What's your job?

17:08.696 --> 17:09.979
I do not believe.

17:11.022 --> 17:12.662
I'm so glad you did not ...

17:12.696 --> 17:14.301
But everyone thinks you ...

17:15.218 --> 17:17.015
How to explain now?

17:17.050 --> 17:19.266
I've already sold half of ...

17:19.300 --> 17:20.640
How to explain?

17:21.593 --> 17:23.992
I think I twisted my ankle. Damn.

17:24.027 --> 17:25.569
Take some aspirin.

17:25.604 --> 17:27.363
Aspirin will not solve this.

17:31.118 --> 17:31.983
Liam ...

17:32.018 --> 17:33.905
What are you doing here? How did you get?

17:33.940 --> 17:36.157
The owner gave me the key.

17:36.192 --> 17:39.764
Do not tell me that you help me give out. That's what I need.

17:39.799 --> 17:42.713
No, no ... I ...

17:45.222 --> 17:47.237
Tell me, Liam.

17:48.336 --> 17:49.920
These are us?

17:49.955 --> 17:51.470
Do not touch that.

17:51.505 --> 17:55.040
If you touch something in this studio, a fucking break your fingers. I'm not kidding.

17:55.075 --> 17:58.887
Know you worked Liam but these are good.

17:58.922 --> 18:00.920
Get fro, of course I'm good.

18:04.273 --> 18:06.745
Why you came to tell me suddenly how good are they?

18:09.786 --> 18:11.526
Not. I...

18:14.604 --> 18:17.113
In fact, I was told that ...

18:17.901 --> 18:18.788
What?

18:21.803 --> 18:26.125
I was told that you are ...

18:26.160 --> 18:28.433
Dead? So what?

18:29.093 --> 18:32.756
I did research and it seems Success when he was young.

18:32.791 --> 18:36.035
and I think it's a story very how interesting here

18:36.070 --> 18:37.921
sensationalism and drama ...

18:37.956 --> 18:39.737
We are not Artnet, McKenzie.

18:39.772 --> 18:42.043
You know I do art critics.

18:42.078 --> 18:43.912
There's an art criticism.

18:45.048 --> 18:46.808
I know I'm gone in the best of terms,

18:46.843 --> 18:49.297
but you said you can contact if I have a good story, and ...

18:49.332 --> 18:50.360
Did I say that?

18:50.726 --> 18:51.624
Yes.

18:52.704 --> 18:54.080
Look, this guy Liam.

18:54.115 --> 18:58.584
He dedicated his entire life creation and his creation is good

18:58.619 --> 18:59.885
and then is that ...

18:59.920 --> 19:00.750
Not.

19:00.785 --> 19:03.292
passing through the deep end, but that does it say about our culture when

19:03.327 --> 19:04.502
this is necessary to ...

19:04.537 --> 19:07.981
I'm telling you. What would be my send anything by email?

19:08.016 --> 19:09.666
Okay, okay.

19:09.701 --> 19:10.863
I was glad to hear you.

19:12.275 --> 19:14.437
Justin, you better put that.

19:15.516 --> 19:16.382
How are you?

19:18.731 --> 19:20.038
So you're saying

19:20.073 --> 19:22.834
my death helps business?

19:22.869 --> 19:25.619
Liam, you must realize that sell Art is the same as

19:25.654 --> 19:28.355
to sell a story how to sell art in itself.

19:28.390 --> 19:30.366
Yeah, well if we go by your last sale, probably

19:30.401 --> 19:32.343
You can sell any silly if the story is pretty good.

19:37.989 --> 19:39.669
Oh, Liam.

19:42.387 --> 19:44.426
I'm awfully glad you're still with us.

19:47.317 --> 19:49.541
And I'm sorry that I've never told you this, but ...

19:50.653 --> 19:52.012
I'll say it now.

19:52.864 --> 19:56.075
I think you have something that I never had.

19:57.127 --> 19:58.173
A gift.

19:59.142 --> 20:02.945
And even it would hurt to see him lose.

20:11.052 --> 20:12.702
And now?

20:15.052 --> 20:19.375
I suppose I'll have to say human and to cancel the exhibition.

20:20.738 --> 20:21.940
Wait.

20:24.325 --> 20:25.653
What would happen if you did not do it?

20:26.872 --> 20:28.075
What?

20:28.110 --> 20:31.087
You said that art means to sell a story.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.042
So why not give this story?

20:35.697 --> 20:37.383
I do not know...

20:37.418 --> 20:39.034
It's risky.

20:39.069 --> 20:41.258
Exact. What is art without risk?

20:41.293 --> 20:44.307
That's different. We have to do with some very powerful people.

20:44.342 --> 20:46.477
Yes, I want to disappoint him, right?

20:50.369 --> 20:51.841
I do not know...

20:51.876 --> 20:53.886
You want both our sakes, yes?

20:53.921 --> 20:56.342
That way, I am free I create what I want,

20:56.377 --> 20:58.190
and you can sell you need to sell.

21:00.809 --> 21:02.674
Unless you've seen today?

21:05.239 --> 21:06.889
I see what you mean, yes.

21:09.203 --> 21:12.109
I could not wait to end of the show to

21:12.144 --> 21:14.854
explain a little misunderstanding.

21:14.889 --> 21:17.436
But you will have to stay very hidden.

21:20.611 --> 21:23.194
In this case, you have to go to the store.

21:23.229 --> 21:24.306
I am out of.

21:47.318 --> 21:48.861
Carefully, carefully.

21:48.896 --> 21:50.404
Put it here. So.

22:23.299 --> 22:25.416
So what do you think?

22:25.451 --> 22:27.264
I ...

22:27.299 --> 22:28.411
had doubts.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.843
But you did it.

22:32.878 --> 22:34.205
It's a wonderful exhibition.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.411
Thank you.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.815
Camille, what a surprise nice to see you

22:58.850 --> 23:01.415
so sublime and sophisticated as ever.

23:01.450 --> 23:02.886
I came into town a day earlier.

23:02.921 --> 23:04.733
I thought to stop by.

23:04.768 --> 23:06.133
Pay my respects.

23:06.168 --> 23:09.810
Thank you. Liam would have appreciated it.

23:09.845 --> 23:13.020
It was a lot of publicity of Mr Price and

23:13.055 --> 23:15.406
I was not sure if This is not just a case of

23:15.441 --> 23:17.289
emperor's new clothes.

23:17.324 --> 23:19.245
And what do you think?

23:19.280 --> 23:24.464
You'll expose showing Emperor's nakedness?

23:24.499 --> 23:25.737
Not yet.

23:38.526 --> 23:41.073
I think better seen from inside.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.993
Thank you.

23:59.028 --> 24:03.028
A good. Thanks for coming.

24:03.063 --> 24:03.925
Where's Erik?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.615
It must've been retained to work, but I'm sure it's on the way.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.911
Very good. Excuse me.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.373
What...

24:57.412 --> 25:01.860
Yes. A must see. artist It is interesting and close ...

25:01.895 --> 25:03.153
I'm glad to see you. Thank you.

25:03.188 --> 25:05.843
... A fusion of chaos and horror in his work.

25:05.878 --> 25:10.425
In this work, for example, appears to provoke the viewer to

25:10.460 --> 25:14.972
explore the rules encoded in cyclically They form aesthetics.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.546
Not.

25:27.635 --> 25:30.452
You remove an extravagant show.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.586
I'm sorry, sir, You can not smoke here.

25:32.621 --> 25:33.439
Who says that?

25:36.837 --> 25:40.209
Liam! What part of "stay hidden" do not you understand?

25:40.244 --> 25:41.376
Someone might recognize.

25:41.411 --> 25:43.258
Relax. barely You recognize me.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.855
Get out of here right now.

25:50.343 --> 25:52.119
Sorry, interrupting anything?

25:52.154 --> 25:54.523
No, no, no, we just ...

25:54.558 --> 25:58.307
So how do you like the show ...

25:58.342 --> 25:59.976
- McKenzie. - McKenzie so.

26:00.011 --> 26:03.302
It is inspired. Thank you for invitation.

26:03.337 --> 26:06.594
I did not realize It was so popular.

26:06.629 --> 26:07.545
It was not.

26:11.042 --> 26:12.209
I'm a writer.

26:12.244 --> 26:14.648
I am looking very much to write a story about Liam

26:14.683 --> 26:16.262
and I would very excited Let's talk...

26:16.297 --> 26:17.500
- I appreciate your interest ... - Great!

26:17.535 --> 26:19.437
We like stories, not Daniel?

26:20.405 --> 26:21.391
Sorry, who are you?

26:21.426 --> 26:22.343
Ignore him, he's a student.

26:22.378 --> 26:24.010
In fact, I was very Liam's close.

26:24.045 --> 26:25.589
- No, I was not. - Really? How so?

26:25.624 --> 26:27.383
It's okay, Daniel.

26:27.418 --> 26:29.948
I'm his brother Liam. Jackson.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.418
I did not know he had a brother Liam.

26:33.453 --> 26:35.180
Most people do not know.

26:35.215 --> 26:36.872
I am sorry for your lost.

26:36.907 --> 26:38.719
We rude of me not introduce myself. My name is...

26:38.754 --> 26:42.037
McKenzie. Know. I heard.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.449
Excuse us.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.751
Watch the suit!

26:49.786 --> 26:53.122
Everything goes exactly according to plan. What the hell are you doing?

26:53.157 --> 26:54.235
You agreed to that.

26:54.270 --> 26:58.001
I was never agree you to sabotage the careers of both.

26:59.597 --> 27:00.782
Liam.

27:00.817 --> 27:03.418
Liam, that you wanted always.

27:03.453 --> 27:08.278
As work to sell single so that you can focus on creation.

27:11.776 --> 27:13.749
And after that, what's the plan?

27:14.807 --> 27:16.475
After the show,

27:17.462 --> 27:19.991
I will tell all what happened,

27:20.026 --> 27:22.269
I've found the studio alive.

27:23.345 --> 27:24.906
It's the truth, right?

27:26.323 --> 27:29.067
I mean where I have been all this time?

27:29.102 --> 27:32.242
I do not know. You're the creative.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.605
Make something.

27:46.322 --> 27:47.775
Jackson?

27:50.071 --> 27:51.793
You can watch that bike?

27:55.111 --> 27:56.600
I think bends down the street.

27:57.981 --> 27:59.900
Lord, I do not believe I'm doing this.

28:01.927 --> 28:03.900
To the left. One to the left.

28:09.931 --> 28:11.452
- Just wait a minute. - Good.

28:11.487 --> 28:12.315
Thank you.

28:54.928 --> 28:56.781
Hey.

28:56.816 --> 28:59.338
I'm sorry you had to stay longer.

28:59.373 --> 29:02.188
Do not worry. I did to wake you. Lie back.

29:08.143 --> 29:10.150
- How was the show? - Crowded.

29:10.185 --> 29:14.647
Daniel says he already expects to take additional stock.

29:14.682 --> 29:16.345
Incredible.

29:16.380 --> 29:20.036
Do not worry. I made an offer He can not refuse.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.571
I did not know you like Liam Price's work.

29:24.257 --> 29:26.402
It's not about what I like.

29:26.437 --> 29:29.354
It is an investment for our future.

30:43.491 --> 30:45.349
- Usual? - Two.

30:57.463 --> 30:59.606
Any sell, I do not need.

30:59.641 --> 31:01.714
... I'm not selling McKenzie.

31:01.749 --> 31:04.227
Grain. We met last night in the exhibition.

31:05.614 --> 31:06.472
How did you ...

31:06.507 --> 31:10.073
I followed. I mean ... just because you left so soon.

31:10.817 --> 31:12.080
What do you want?

31:13.542 --> 31:16.232
- Sugar? - No.

31:16.267 --> 31:18.759
- Can I get less? - No.

31:18.794 --> 31:22.238
I thought we could talk little about your brother.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.034
Probably not a good idea.

31:27.069 --> 31:28.753
You know you said last night that a story as ...

31:28.788 --> 31:30.438
And I changed my mind.

31:32.346 --> 31:34.228
If there's something else, I return to work.

31:36.731 --> 31:39.926
Can I use your bathroom?

31:39.961 --> 31:40.917
What?

31:44.064 --> 31:45.377
I think you are joking.

31:48.003 --> 31:49.786
- Hurry. - Thank you!

31:49.821 --> 31:51.595
And do not touch anything.

31:53.081 --> 31:55.187
This is Liam's studio?

31:57.070 --> 31:59.324
The bathroom's down here.

31:59.359 --> 32:00.662
Not.

32:02.074 --> 32:03.734
Right.

32:19.218 --> 32:21.324
You done there?

32:32.497 --> 32:33.835
How do you like?

32:35.668 --> 32:38.344
It's from my favorite cafe, It is just around the corner from my hotel.

32:38.379 --> 32:40.103
I go there every morning.

32:42.852 --> 32:44.091
Sorry.

32:46.470 --> 32:48.774
I think it's very hard for you.

32:50.186 --> 32:53.382
Yes, it's extremely difficult, and why I want to be left alone.

32:56.032 --> 32:58.510
Tell me why exactly do this?

32:59.947 --> 33:02.240
There's so much life in the work of Liam,

33:02.275 --> 33:05.248
He is so talented. I'm just wondering ...

33:05.283 --> 33:06.824
Why would drop everything.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.508
Let me explain your meaning.

33:08.543 --> 33:11.046
Why do not you tell me what's your position,

33:11.081 --> 33:12.819
I'll tell you what you want to know.

33:12.854 --> 33:15.420
I just want to know the truth what happened.

33:15.455 --> 33:18.602
Believe me, the last thing anyone wants to hear is the truth.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.093
You want a story.

33:21.128 --> 33:24.572
A good story contains discovery a certain kind of truth.

33:26.059 --> 33:27.211
Paint.

33:27.246 --> 33:28.328
What?

33:28.363 --> 33:30.122
On the cheek...

33:31.410 --> 33:32.861
Right here on ...

33:32.896 --> 33:35.473
Oh, for God's sake, can you please go now?

33:36.662 --> 33:41.146
I think you would do well get out of here a little.

33:41.181 --> 33:42.831
Why do not you let me to the out to lunch?

33:42.866 --> 33:44.144
I do not eat.

33:45.705 --> 33:48.578
And I was the same when my grandmother died.

33:49.421 --> 33:52.864
Which is something completely different because she was old.

33:54.772 --> 33:56.035
I finished?

33:57.844 --> 33:59.023
I am sorry.

33:59.058 --> 34:01.585
I thought this would go better than going.

34:01.620 --> 34:04.706
I'm a little untrained.

34:05.350 --> 34:07.966
- This is plastic? - No, no, no ... you can not ...

34:08.001 --> 34:11.172
Actually, you know what? I would use fresh air. You are right.

34:14.442 --> 34:15.954
You said you wanted to know truth about Liam.

34:15.989 --> 34:18.891
Wait. Where ... where are we going?

34:18.927 --> 34:23.360
I did not bike because I took a taxi. So maybe ...

34:23.396 --> 34:25.036
It's fine. Get.

34:25.071 --> 34:27.969
- Oh, my God, no. I do not climb. - Why not?

34:29.357 --> 34:30.620
Do not you trust me?

34:37.804 --> 34:39.652
Where are we going?

34:39.687 --> 34:41.347
It sure this is legal?

34:45.806 --> 34:49.893
Yes, thank you. Can you a keep for 24 hours. Yes.

34:50.935 --> 34:52.917
See you. I kiss you. Ciao.

35:04.907 --> 35:06.433
Violating someone's property?

35:06.468 --> 35:08.524
You ever stop of asking questions?

35:12.761 --> 35:14.594
It's nice that the work of Liam finally gets his

35:14.629 --> 35:16.526
appreciation it deserves.

35:16.561 --> 35:17.617
Indeed.

35:18.831 --> 35:21.793
Not that it mattered to him, now that is no longer alive.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.999
But if he had not died so there never would have been appreciated.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.566
I do not know what to say.

35:27.601 --> 35:29.310
I'm sure it would be finally discovered.

35:29.345 --> 35:31.366
Cream always comes up.

35:32.308 --> 35:33.957
See, that's the difference between us.

35:33.992 --> 35:38.030
I rather philosophy that shit floats.

35:38.065 --> 35:39.705
What is that?

35:39.740 --> 35:43.084
A bee. A lot of bees die mysteriously.

35:44.571 --> 35:47.296
They call Colony Collapse Disease.

35:47.331 --> 35:50.021
It could be an apocalypse. It's fascinating.

35:50.056 --> 35:51.512
Look. Around here.

35:51.547 --> 35:52.969
It's scary.

35:54.158 --> 35:56.625
What is this place?

35:56.660 --> 35:59.583
It smells like cigarettes and diarrhea.

35:59.618 --> 36:02.507
It's the scent of creativity.

36:20.444 --> 36:22.376
Not cool place?

36:22.411 --> 36:23.540
Absolute.

36:25.993 --> 36:28.124
That's incredible.

36:44.227 --> 36:46.209
Why did Liam Berlin?

36:46.244 --> 36:47.844
Because it was cheaper.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.385
Somehow unexplored.

36:50.420 --> 36:53.245
Should not art be inspired by beauty?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.954
This place is so dreary.

36:54.989 --> 36:56.267
That makes it interesting.

36:57.184 --> 36:58.536
And it's a little depressing?

36:58.571 --> 37:01.494
Because you can feel the weight history and turmoil around every corner.

37:01.529 --> 37:03.303
See, that greatness arises.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.384
Turmoil?

37:05.419 --> 37:06.900
Yes.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.382
Why?

37:09.174 --> 37:10.859
Because destroys contentment.

37:12.606 --> 37:13.884
Contentment is ...

37:14.839 --> 37:15.642
death.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.910
I'm sure there are a lot of people who would agree with you

37:19.945 --> 37:21.905
and it would say that death is death.

37:42.877 --> 37:45.293
So, what are you doing, Jackson?

37:47.259 --> 37:48.186
I'm a lawyer.

37:48.706 --> 37:50.230
You do not seem lawyer.

37:50.265 --> 37:51.824
Things are not always as they seem.

37:55.027 --> 37:56.319
Why did you choose law?

37:56.354 --> 37:57.464
I have chosen.

37:57.499 --> 37:58.862
It's what my father wanted Always to be.

37:58.897 --> 38:00.143
Where are your parents now?

38:00.178 --> 38:01.355
I do not know what is relevant.

38:01.390 --> 38:03.441
You are my best chance to get to know Liam.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.236
Good luck with that.

38:10.970 --> 38:13.653
You know, I think Liam will probably

38:13.688 --> 38:15.606
what we all want.

38:15.641 --> 38:16.505
Meaning?

38:17.305 --> 38:18.373
To be understood.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.199
Count.

38:21.913 --> 38:23.682
Do you think you can help with this?

38:23.717 --> 38:25.017
I think I can try.

38:29.961 --> 38:31.429
Did you ever think that maybe Liam

38:31.464 --> 38:33.431
was killed because He wanted to be left alone?

38:41.789 --> 38:43.264
You want to know the truth?

38:45.258 --> 38:48.461
I have to write a great story to impress my editor,

38:48.496 --> 38:50.891
that I was fired because I was not essential.

38:51.902 --> 38:54.410
And you're the first person that I said that.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.320
I lied to everyone I am saying that I resigned

38:56.355 --> 38:59.965
because I could not bear the idea like people to feel sorry for me.

39:00.000 --> 39:00.878
Nonsense.

39:03.814 --> 39:05.148
I was ashamed of failure.

39:10.528 --> 39:11.736
Yes it is.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.686
I was humiliated.

39:20.052 --> 39:22.320
And why are you telling me all this?

39:22.355 --> 39:24.554
It's easy to tell the truth to strangers.

39:24.589 --> 39:26.977
Anyway, I'm very happy on that now.

39:28.382 --> 39:31.556
I'm free to do what I want Erik and I supported very much

39:31.591 --> 39:33.589
and I feel lucky.

39:33.624 --> 39:35.588
I feel very lucky.

39:40.602 --> 39:43.988
So what are you doing here with me instead of being lucky home?

39:46.867 --> 39:48.778
You say that like I would sneak.

39:48.813 --> 39:50.344
- You do? - No.

39:50.379 --> 39:52.971
I want to write a good story.

39:53.006 --> 39:55.443
To remember what I wanted to write from the beginning.

39:55.478 --> 39:57.880
No, you just want to do it regret that you were fired.

39:59.467 --> 40:00.268
Yes.

40:01.321 --> 40:02.712
I want to prove I can.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.100
And I want to prove to them that they were wrong.

40:06.308 --> 40:08.696
What's so wrong with that?

40:08.731 --> 40:09.584
Nothing.

40:11.014 --> 40:12.208
I think it's fantastic.

40:16.056 --> 40:18.093
I'm you're the one who He wants to be heard.

40:18.128 --> 40:19.442
Or understood, as you said.

40:23.515 --> 40:25.391
Yes me...

40:25.426 --> 40:26.746
I think it was enough.

40:29.106 --> 40:31.789
And here I was, about to me pour out my soul for you.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.336
McKenzie.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.239
Thanks for giving me the time.

40:58.274 --> 40:59.096
Of course.

40:59.756 --> 41:02.474
Now, about that story of yours,

41:02.509 --> 41:05.157
I'm not saying it's not a good idea

41:05.192 --> 41:07.622
but maybe it's a little premature, you know.

41:07.657 --> 41:10.052
Liam was a man very complicated.

41:10.937 --> 41:12.342
It was not easy to understand.

41:12.377 --> 41:13.746
What is this?

41:14.407 --> 41:15.868
That? A.

41:16.458 --> 41:18.677
It's a gift from Liam.

41:18.712 --> 41:19.730
Creepy, right?

41:21.950 --> 41:23.629
Bees.

41:23.664 --> 41:26.501
Look, I would be very happy to talk to you about it,

41:26.536 --> 41:29.956
if what you care is the profile.

41:30.968 --> 41:32.408
Absolute.

41:32.443 --> 41:34.199
Nothing more than a profile.

41:34.234 --> 41:35.182
I promise.

41:36.825 --> 41:40.267
I liked it as soon as we met. It was very agreeable.

41:40.302 --> 41:42.258
I had a close relationship.

41:42.293 --> 41:44.214
A friendship. Yes, I think ...

41:44.776 --> 41:47.374
You might call it friendship.

41:47.409 --> 41:48.386
Why?

41:51.855 --> 41:53.028
Why what?

41:53.063 --> 41:54.651
Why are you doing this?

41:57.853 --> 41:59.356
Share a gallery.

42:00.311 --> 42:01.955
What brought you here?

42:05.340 --> 42:06.738
I love art.

42:06.773 --> 42:09.287
And I like to introduce people art quality.

42:09.322 --> 42:11.015
It was difficult, right?

42:13.108 --> 42:15.328
When the gallery was problems in recent years.

42:17.364 --> 42:20.272
I think most galleries have emerged slowly ...

42:20.307 --> 42:22.583
So this script It works for you.

42:22.618 --> 42:25.820
And Liam became the Conveniently more profitable.

42:26.719 --> 42:27.801
Since he died.

42:29.599 --> 42:32.333
I think this scenario, as you call it,

42:32.368 --> 42:34.739
He gave people the chance to finally see

42:34.774 --> 42:37.110
which overlooked years in a row.

42:37.145 --> 42:39.685
Liam's real talent.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.693
And yours.

42:41.728 --> 42:45.714
You mean you did not bring ever career artist at this level.

42:45.749 --> 42:49.473
It must be nice to be finally recognized for your talent.

42:51.261 --> 42:56.070
If only I care assessment and monetary profits, Miss ...

42:56.105 --> 42:58.567
Miss ...

42:58.602 --> 43:03.368
I lead a better close any other job than that.

43:09.263 --> 43:11.284
Everyone thinks artistic that guy is dead

43:11.319 --> 43:13.526
and I stand to chat with him.

43:13.561 --> 43:15.582
You're the only one He knows about this?

43:15.617 --> 43:16.866
From what I can tell, yes.

43:16.901 --> 43:20.827
I mean do not know what plan, but to give him a headache.

43:20.862 --> 43:24.753
Then, if you really can To get this story

43:24.788 --> 43:25.952
I will publish.

43:25.987 --> 43:28.350
You can not imagine how I am happy to hear that.

43:36.159 --> 43:37.337
How are you?

43:37.372 --> 43:39.457
Moving table near the window.

43:40.287 --> 43:43.252
I can see that, but why?

43:43.287 --> 43:45.252
I thought to start to write again.

43:45.287 --> 43:47.614
We do not live here. Can not to move things as you want.

43:47.649 --> 43:51.033
Nobody lives here. I'm sure he will not mind.

43:59.331 --> 44:00.480
I am sorry.

44:05.204 --> 44:07.502
I have not given enough attention lately.

44:07.537 --> 44:10.234
Is that it?

44:10.269 --> 44:14.056
Not. Work, and I understand that.

44:14.091 --> 44:15.524
Then what's the problem?

44:17.312 --> 44:19.206
Please, just ...

44:19.241 --> 44:21.100
talk to me.

44:36.293 --> 44:38.314
I never left.

44:38.349 --> 44:39.577
From where?

44:39.612 --> 44:41.577
From work.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.506
I never resigned.

44:44.464 --> 44:46.123
I was fired.

44:48.677 --> 44:51.557
That is all?

44:51.592 --> 44:55.571
It's ... it's okay.

44:57.018 --> 45:00.473
- It's good. - It's not good.

45:00.508 --> 45:03.061
I lost my fire for writing.

45:04.253 --> 45:08.275
Cut staff and said They are dispensable, and I was.

45:10.126 --> 45:14.147
But it's okay because I have an idea story and it's so good!

45:14.182 --> 45:15.850
What kind of story?

45:20.510 --> 45:22.135
Good.

45:22.170 --> 45:25.064
After the show, I watched his brother Liam Price home.

45:25.099 --> 45:27.199
He recommended as his brother Liam Price.

45:27.234 --> 45:29.404
But when I went to the gallery, it was a head with a lot of dead bees ...

45:29.439 --> 45:32.128
Wait, slow down. What you did?

45:33.235 --> 45:35.809
What if I told

45:35.844 --> 45:37.682
Liam Price ...

45:37.717 --> 45:39.022
He is alive?

45:40.320 --> 45:41.392
What do you want to say?

45:41.427 --> 45:44.839
Art Market buys name and time,

45:44.874 --> 45:46.555
so what would happen if an artist He went so far

45:46.590 --> 45:47.981
as to fake his death ...

45:48.016 --> 45:50.747
Of. Not. Please.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.626
It's ridiculous.

45:52.661 --> 45:54.436
It's brilliant.

45:54.471 --> 45:57.088
Ie how well you know truly Liam Price?

45:57.123 --> 45:58.287
Well enough.

45:58.322 --> 46:00.035
And I know Daniel Volpe years.

46:00.070 --> 46:01.685
He would realize if Liam would be alive.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.301
- But if he participate? - Take what?

46:03.336 --> 46:04.429
A deception!

46:11.153 --> 46:14.012
Look, I know ...

46:14.047 --> 46:18.069
You want to write a great story to prove something to ...

46:18.104 --> 46:21.694
Contact your job back, but be realistic.

46:21.729 --> 46:25.282
If someone would try to do something so absurd,

46:25.317 --> 46:27.261
circulate rumors and, believe me,

46:28.261 --> 46:29.793
I'd be the first to learn.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.922
Yes you are right.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.752
Still, it's an interesting premise.

46:40.787 --> 46:42.944
Yes, you've always been creative.

47:03.010 --> 47:04.754
... You know how I feel when it comes to show the world works.

47:04.789 --> 47:06.528
Must for once ...

47:06.563 --> 47:08.584
- No ... - Go and enjoy the fresh air.

47:08.619 --> 47:10.606
I do not want to get anyone in my studio.

47:10.641 --> 47:12.359
You're a clichÃ©, you know that, right?

47:12.394 --> 47:14.415
I'm fucking clichÃ©? Have you looked at yourself?

47:14.450 --> 47:15.734
Please, go and walk around ...

47:51.695 --> 47:53.150
You do what you gotta do. I do not care.

47:53.185 --> 47:55.653
Camille is extremely important. You saw your work and ...

48:03.143 --> 48:04.707
I do not care if her papa.

48:04.742 --> 48:06.236
I do not get anyone in the studio.

48:06.271 --> 48:09.098
I did not require it. Would not you, will come to visit.

48:09.133 --> 48:10.284
You do not even have to be ...

48:10.319 --> 48:11.427
McKenzie!

48:12.571 --> 48:13.481
McKenzie?

48:13.516 --> 48:14.371
Hi.

48:14.406 --> 48:15.292
How are you?

48:15.327 --> 48:16.456
- What ... - I knocked,

48:16.491 --> 48:17.929
but nobody answered.

48:17.964 --> 48:19.367
So I came by ...

48:20.109 --> 48:21.048
roof.

48:21.083 --> 48:23.179
You know, McKenzie is a awesome writer.

48:23.214 --> 48:25.695
Yes I know. I spoke...

48:25.730 --> 48:28.141
How's the story?

48:28.176 --> 48:30.717
E ... developing.

48:31.585 --> 48:34.825
You know what, Daniel? Bring who you want.

48:35.545 --> 48:37.034
Have fun.

48:37.069 --> 48:39.991
- No no no... - It's fine. Take as long as you want.

48:40.026 --> 48:40.930
I'm sure McKenzie and me

48:40.965 --> 48:42.638
We find a lot things to discuss.

48:44.205 --> 48:45.962
Do not you think you should to be reasonable?

48:45.997 --> 48:47.953
I discussed this, Liam ... Jackson!

48:49.032 --> 48:50.218
Damn!

48:52.081 --> 48:53.500
Hi, Camille.

48:54.283 --> 48:56.154
What was it?

48:56.189 --> 48:59.175
No support visits to the studio. I feel like the zoo.

49:04.362 --> 49:07.687
Liam was a person rather lonely maybe I am just conservative.

49:07.722 --> 49:09.889
You should not be so hard on him.

49:09.924 --> 49:10.828
Who?

49:10.863 --> 49:13.488
Daniel. I think acting Liam's interest.

49:17.342 --> 49:18.951
Should I return ...

49:18.986 --> 49:20.441
Oh, no, come on.

49:20.476 --> 49:23.207
Forget about it for a day let's go do something.

49:23.242 --> 49:25.642
Can you tell me more Liam.

49:25.677 --> 49:27.442
- I can not. - Why?

49:29.474 --> 49:30.830
Do not you trust me?

49:49.653 --> 49:51.072
- Want? - No.

50:01.913 --> 50:03.480
What fucking mess.

50:09.747 --> 50:10.743
What is this?

50:11.568 --> 50:13.876
Neither Liam did not like food as you?

50:13.911 --> 50:16.883
You have an obsession with food. I'm tired.

50:25.586 --> 50:28.091
Linda? Linda Who's that?

50:28.126 --> 50:31.366
He was an artist who put images these all over the city,

50:31.401 --> 50:32.707
saying that this girl ...

50:32.742 --> 50:36.003
Fran and his heart He asks her to take him back.

50:36.038 --> 50:37.672
It seems desperate.

50:37.707 --> 50:39.271
But romantic.

50:39.306 --> 50:41.156
Increasingly more images began to appear,

50:41.191 --> 50:43.604
and then people in the community They began to get involved,

50:43.639 --> 50:45.934
someone posted a newspaper ad that read:

50:45.969 --> 50:48.101
"She loves you, Linda, take it back!"

50:48.136 --> 50:50.804
others wrote next to images that "It's a coward. Do not."

50:50.839 --> 50:52.505
Damn, it's too clean.

50:52.540 --> 50:55.144
And someday, artist He appeared in public.

50:55.179 --> 50:57.247
And you know what? Linda was not real.

50:57.282 --> 50:59.316
So it was all a lie?

51:00.226 --> 51:01.623
It was a story.

51:08.463 --> 51:09.458
Wine.

51:12.824 --> 51:14.857
Hi. Come in. Welcome.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.101
So

51:23.136 --> 51:27.223
Liam spent here Most of the time,

51:27.258 --> 51:30.512
working and living.

51:30.547 --> 51:33.511
You know, of course, the quality of his work ...

51:33.546 --> 51:35.425
What inspires Liam?

51:35.460 --> 51:37.429
What inspires everyone. Life.

51:39.652 --> 51:41.092
Yes, but he chose to leave.

51:42.743 --> 51:44.416
Not much sense, right?

51:46.724 --> 51:47.931
You do not understand.

51:48.990 --> 51:50.133
Try me.

51:51.361 --> 51:55.151
What was it? He had fame? More money?

51:57.502 --> 51:58.539
I do not know.

52:03.346 --> 52:04.531
Maybe.

52:10.058 --> 52:11.886
What is this?

52:11.921 --> 52:17.010
Nothing. E unfinished and not worth mentioning.

52:17.045 --> 52:22.381
On the other hand, there is a new series of paintings that he ...

52:23.842 --> 52:25.980
Excuse me. I am sorry. I reject the call.

52:26.015 --> 52:27.999
Do not, you can respond.

52:28.034 --> 52:30.011
Are you sure? I apologize.

52:30.046 --> 52:34.259
Hello? Yes. I can not really talk now ...

52:38.050 --> 52:39.108
Take this one down.

52:45.884 --> 52:47.599
So where were we?

52:49.060 --> 52:51.209
What do you think?

52:51.244 --> 52:53.358
You like?

52:53.393 --> 52:54.221
Not.

52:58.228 --> 52:59.263
I love it.

53:03.522 --> 53:06.401
Do you think Liam would have been happy with it?

53:07.418 --> 53:09.429
With the success and ...

53:09.464 --> 53:10.403
Not.

53:15.633 --> 53:16.517
Not.

53:30.963 --> 53:31.852
Why not?

53:33.949 --> 53:35.960
Ie become more valuable.

53:37.209 --> 53:38.890
Everybody likes him.

53:38.925 --> 53:40.576
I do not give a damn what everyone likes.

53:40.611 --> 53:42.503
It's not about being liked.

53:43.562 --> 53:45.086
It's about feelings.

53:46.441 --> 53:47.500
Any.

53:50.422 --> 53:54.255
The whole world has become so disconnected from any real sense,

53:54.290 --> 53:56.838
that barely communicate.

53:58.828 --> 54:00.783
We are a bunch of liars.

54:00.818 --> 54:03.663
We lie to each other, We lie to ourselves.

54:03.698 --> 54:06.895
We do not say what we really feel, God forbid to say who we are,

54:07.912 --> 54:09.479
because we're too scared.

54:13.269 --> 54:14.963
Instead, try to please.

54:18.605 --> 54:19.939
It's terrible.

54:30.526 --> 54:32.484
Oh God! It is mine.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.443
I phone again and ...

54:34.478 --> 54:35.861
Sorry.

54:41.621 --> 54:42.427
- Hello. - Hello?

54:42.462 --> 54:44.042
Yes. Honey, it's me.

54:44.077 --> 54:46.406
- Hi darling. - Hey, we have dinner tonight, do not forget.

54:46.441 --> 54:48.743
- Oh, great. - Yes, at 9. Will you be there?

54:48.778 --> 54:51.403
- Yeah, see you there. - OK I have to go. I love you.

54:51.438 --> 54:53.224
- I love you too. - Bye Bye.

54:57.226 --> 54:58.221
I am sorry.

55:01.821 --> 55:03.271
What was I saying?

55:03.306 --> 55:04.721
Does not matter.

55:08.067 --> 55:09.168
So what do we do next?

55:17.849 --> 55:19.924
Okay, so what brings you you in Berlin?

55:21.661 --> 55:23.026
My friend.

55:23.061 --> 55:24.392
Fiance.

55:25.959 --> 55:29.199
He was my friend, and then he was promoted.

55:29.234 --> 55:30.384
Rank fiance?

55:31.972 --> 55:34.789
The post of chief consultant of art new hotel in Berlin.

55:36.143 --> 55:37.414
So you've just followed?

55:39.256 --> 55:41.522
There is nothing wrong in following someone you love.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.164
Anyway, let's stick to Liam.

55:46.032 --> 55:48.234
What kind of relationship did he have?

55:48.996 --> 55:51.474
Do not have relations. Era married to his work.

55:51.509 --> 55:52.624
What kind of life is that?

55:52.659 --> 55:55.306
A life dedicated to something more important than himself?

55:55.341 --> 55:58.393
A life dedicated to something which threw him over the edge?

55:58.428 --> 56:01.446
I mean no matter how loved art, art not able to love him back.

56:02.653 --> 56:05.025
How about you? Why is it so especially in your relationship?

56:05.554 --> 56:06.549
Erik?

56:07.777 --> 56:08.815
It's perfect.

56:09.831 --> 56:11.511
And that you want, perfection?

56:11.546 --> 56:14.341
There's nothing wrong with having someone that to come home.

56:17.369 --> 56:19.381
You think you know everything.

56:20.884 --> 56:21.950
It is not like that.

56:21.985 --> 56:23.192
You become defensive.

56:23.227 --> 56:24.364
Become unseemly.

56:24.399 --> 56:26.855
And you become interesting.

56:26.890 --> 56:27.760
Get lost.

56:31.916 --> 56:34.689
So which is it? You want to disappear or want to help with the story?

56:40.872 --> 56:42.354
You are so...

57:02.914 --> 57:03.719
Here.

57:08.144 --> 57:09.043
Thank you.

57:22.542 --> 57:25.020
Hey. Look.

57:28.916 --> 57:30.575
Bye!

57:30.610 --> 57:31.633
What is?

57:31.668 --> 57:32.727
Stop. Come on!

57:32.762 --> 57:33.751
- No. - Come on!

57:33.786 --> 57:36.009
- God. What are we doing? - Come on!

57:36.044 --> 57:37.245
Not really.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.412
- Look. - God!

57:38.447 --> 57:39.545
Good. After you.

57:42.319 --> 57:43.335
Watch your step.

57:45.220 --> 57:46.829
Welcome aboard!

57:49.116 --> 57:50.407
Where are we going?

57:50.442 --> 57:51.699
Do not worry.

58:42.157 --> 58:43.324
Come on!

58:43.359 --> 58:44.894
I do not know any dance.

59:25.549 --> 59:26.433
You are fine?

59:26.468 --> 59:27.788
They are less hindered.

59:27.823 --> 59:29.208
I think you're a little drunk.

59:29.243 --> 59:30.896
I drank only ...

59:34.862 --> 59:37.318
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

59:37.353 --> 59:38.444
Yes.

59:41.002 --> 59:42.282
You?

59:44.763 --> 59:45.638
Yes.

59:52.465 --> 59:55.535
Perhaps we should to do this more often.

59:55.570 --> 59:56.891
Have fun, I mean.

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:13.972
What?

01:00:14.007 --> 01:00:15.849
Do you have another question, right?

01:00:17.973 --> 01:00:19.687
Come on, tell me.

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:25.751
Liam was happy?

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.994
When you think about people I admire the most,

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:34.373
not because I admire They lived a happy life.

01:00:34.408 --> 01:00:36.257
It's always unhappy,

01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:38.569
risks and sacrifices they did

01:00:38.604 --> 01:00:40.258
and agony they have endured.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.068
What we admire most It is not happiness.

01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:47.156
It greatness.

01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:49.417
So you prefer more to be great than happy?

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.357
You do not?

01:00:59.984 --> 01:01:02.568
When I was in kindergarten,

01:01:02.603 --> 01:01:05.117
I had a project that

01:01:05.152 --> 01:01:08.606
each had to put mark on a yellow

01:01:08.641 --> 01:01:10.286
and wrote underneath:

01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:11.932
"I am someone special."

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.356
The idea was to show that Every fingerprint is unique.

01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:20.391
But then grow.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:23.983
And you realize that you're someone special.

01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:27.044
Just like everyone else.

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:29.995
I know we all build children However, but maybe

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:31.940
We should tell them the truth.

01:01:32.784 --> 01:01:35.896
Many of you are special

01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:38.045
So do not get up expectations too high,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.408
because most of your you will not reach greatness.

01:01:43.811 --> 01:01:47.409
In the real world you find that so many things happen

01:01:47.444 --> 01:01:50.975
that you completely out of control, and you find yourself at a time

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:54.429
suddenly willing to settle with every comfort and safety

01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:55.887
that can cling.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:03.016
Maybe there are a few brave enough

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:05.354
and can pretty stupid that continue to fight.

01:02:06.454 --> 01:02:07.938
But for how long?

01:02:09.115 --> 01:02:11.878
At what point do you accept simply life?

01:02:13.285 --> 01:02:17.446
Perhaps acceptance is path to happiness.

01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:19.733
Or maybe that means just give up.

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:28.150
I understand what you say, but

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:31.809
I sincerely believe that each person this world

01:02:32.884 --> 01:02:35.417
It has the potential to do something great.

01:02:38.026 --> 01:02:39.050
And perhaps the only thing we need

01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:40.644
it's a little encouragement.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.943
I need to tell you something.

01:03:08.033 --> 01:03:09.575
- How long will you stay at ... - What will ...

01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:12.623
You tell.

01:03:13.618 --> 01:03:14.496
No, I just ...

01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:18.314
You should go.

01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:20.160
Someone waiting for you.

01:03:24.538 --> 01:03:25.524
Yes.

01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:43.188
I leave you here then.

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:48.981
Thank you.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:55.097
I hope you know what I had the story.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.604
What will you do now?

01:04:01.616 --> 01:04:03.044
Whatever inspires me.

01:04:23.243 --> 01:04:26.857
It's absurd. That is exactly he likes the press, and ...

01:04:28.889 --> 01:04:30.386
Sorry I'm late.

01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:32.154
You are fine?

01:04:32.189 --> 01:04:33.500
I was worried.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.740
McKenzie. How wonderful.

01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:42.482
Thanks to the recent acquisition that did Camille,

01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:45.616
there is absolutely no doubt in my mind

01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:49.486
Liam Price will soon ranking accepted

01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:52.895
Top of contemporary artists.

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:57.703
I wonder how it will progress.

01:04:57.738 --> 01:04:59.189
Congratulations, Daniel.

01:04:59.757 --> 01:05:02.257
Of course, I know circumstances in which

01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:06.094
Liam's work was are recognized and appreciated

01:05:06.129 --> 01:05:07.963
far from ideal.

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:12.071
However, there is no doubt it's something

01:05:12.106 --> 01:05:13.142
deserved.

01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:28.944
What?

01:05:31.521 --> 01:05:32.458
I bet all the money

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:35.520
we are the most beautiful couple in this restaurant.

01:05:54.554 --> 01:05:56.258
I'm not feeling too well.

01:05:56.293 --> 01:05:57.928
Not? What's the problem?

01:05:57.963 --> 01:06:00.334
Nothing. I just wish I back to the hotel and sit down.

01:06:01.012 --> 01:06:03.175
- I am sorry. - You have not even touched your food.

01:06:08.278 --> 01:06:09.370
It's fine?

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.672
What are you doing here?

01:06:21.707 --> 01:06:23.651
- You must know something. - I do not want to know.

01:06:23.686 --> 01:06:25.596
You do not understand. I can not I let you go through this.

01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:26.645
- Please go. - Listen to me.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.510
Stop!

01:06:27.545 --> 01:06:29.530
- Erik! - What happens here?

01:06:35.802 --> 01:06:36.870
McKenzie, who was?

01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:39.134
It's a funny story. It happens that ...

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:40.288
It was nobody.

01:06:40.323 --> 01:06:43.210
Just a guy on the street. I was feeling sick.

01:06:45.319 --> 01:06:46.881
- Please take me home? - Sure.

01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:50.760
Let's go. Goodbye, Daniel.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.442
What's the problem?

01:07:13.477 --> 01:07:15.258
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:07:17.126 --> 01:07:18.776
I need a drink.

01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:43.896
You have not said a word since we left the restaurant. Is everything okay?

01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:49.292
I want to write the story.

01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:52.080
I want so much to write story, and I realized that

01:07:52.115 --> 01:07:54.233
I can not write the story.

01:07:54.268 --> 01:07:56.328
All the story?

01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.942
The art world is complicated. You do not want to get involved.

01:07:58.977 --> 01:08:00.055
That's the thing.

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.078
I want to get involved. I want to feel troubled

01:08:02.113 --> 01:08:03.816
and I want to do something great.

01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:05.354
Know.

01:08:05.389 --> 01:08:08.000
And I know it was painful to lose work. What I ask is

01:08:08.035 --> 01:08:10.142
as long as you continue to trying to prove something.

01:08:10.177 --> 01:08:11.211
Perhaps as much as it needed.

01:08:11.246 --> 01:08:13.822
You know what? I thought that taking you on this trip

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:15.911
and can cheer you up it was not such a good idea

01:08:15.946 --> 01:08:18.412
because obviously not you feel better at all.

01:08:29.886 --> 01:08:31.733
Why do not we go home A few days earlier?

01:08:33.886 --> 01:08:35.776
I finished with the project anyway.

01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:40.880
Good?

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:52.452
Yes.

01:08:54.919 --> 01:08:55.818
Let's go home.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:14.761
Liam. What the hell is going on? Call me.

01:09:21.919 --> 01:09:25.841
Liam. Should I worry? Call me back.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.064
Liam, please. Call me.

01:09:58.099 --> 01:09:58.973
Please.

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:01.473
Daniel, by the way.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:25.883
You were right in connection with coffee.

01:10:26.517 --> 01:10:27.861
What are you doing here?

01:10:27.896 --> 01:10:29.170
You can not appear ...

01:10:29.205 --> 01:10:30.855
Uninvited, to ask the time?

01:10:31.445 --> 01:10:32.767
What kind of person would do that?

01:10:37.236 --> 01:10:40.000
You came to me looking truth about Liam.

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.476
Give me a chance to explain.

01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:43.003
Erik expected.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:44.448
Let's meet then.

01:10:44.483 --> 01:10:45.844
Tonight.

01:10:45.879 --> 01:10:47.212
I'll tell you everything.

01:10:48.436 --> 01:10:49.845
You could write a great story.

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:51.539
Liam ...

01:11:57.284 --> 01:11:58.160
Liam.

01:12:00.431 --> 01:12:01.420
Liam!

01:12:01.455 --> 01:12:02.409
What?

01:12:08.462 --> 01:12:09.336
How did you ...

01:12:15.335 --> 01:12:16.756
How long have you?

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:17.881
Does it matter?

01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:21.574
You're not a lawyer very convincing.

01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:27.179
God, I'm such an idiot.

01:12:31.244 --> 01:12:34.041
And I waited to tell the story that they knew all along.

01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:37.789
You lied to me all the time.

01:12:37.824 --> 01:12:39.308
Look who's Talking!

01:12:39.343 --> 01:12:40.726
That's something else.

01:12:40.761 --> 01:12:42.826
I was honest about things that had meaning.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:46.656
I told my life.

01:12:46.691 --> 01:12:48.375
You're just using me?

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:51.163
Bravo, I understand that you found eventually heading.

01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:52.745
What sheep thinks about me.

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.392
But do you care what I think people about you.

01:12:55.427 --> 01:12:57.214
No people, too.

01:12:57.249 --> 01:12:58.406
I care what you think.

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:01.238
Come on ... you say that only not to expose you.

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:03.117
Go and expose me.

01:13:04.144 --> 01:13:05.668
- It's a challenge? - Absolutely.

01:13:05.703 --> 01:13:07.158
Do not challenge me. I will do it.

01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:09.564
I know you will. That I love you.

01:13:14.415 --> 01:13:16.316
You're like a bright flame.

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:18.676
And you're burning all the time.

01:13:20.599 --> 01:13:22.553
There are people who They will not stand it,

01:13:22.588 --> 01:13:24.380
but that does not mean You must change.

01:13:26.358 --> 01:13:28.369
You just have to find someone who not only loves you,

01:13:29.264 --> 01:13:30.980
but can maintain that fire.

01:13:44.737 --> 01:13:46.922
Oh God. What I do?

01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:50.145
You do not have relationships, remember?

01:13:52.789 --> 01:13:54.177
You are selfish

01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:56.903
and unpredictable

01:13:56.938 --> 01:13:58.635
and temperamental

01:13:59.575 --> 01:14:01.738
and completely insane.

01:14:04.175 --> 01:14:05.672
Tell me it's not.

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.966
So how could you you expect from me

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.817
to give up everything I have,

01:14:15.965 --> 01:14:17.101
to be with you?

01:14:20.925 --> 01:14:22.225
I expect nothing.

01:14:27.274 --> 01:14:28.607
You know that you were right.

01:14:31.655 --> 01:14:33.688
There's nothing wrong with having someone that to come home.

01:14:37.523 --> 01:14:40.123
Just make sure that the person That's your biggest fan.

01:14:49.662 --> 01:14:50.831
I have to go.

01:15:53.918 --> 01:15:54.773
Liam.

01:15:58.375 --> 01:16:00.322
- Liam! - Leave me alone, Daniel.

01:16:00.357 --> 01:16:02.551
Oh, for God's sake, once alive

01:16:02.586 --> 01:16:04.738
do not do a show and got into the car.

01:16:07.499 --> 01:16:08.335
Liam!

01:16:22.137 --> 01:16:23.175
You're still awake.

01:16:24.043 --> 01:16:25.105
We are waiting for you.

01:16:35.063 --> 01:16:36.187
I feel...

01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:41.832
confused.

01:16:45.424 --> 01:16:47.012
Like I know where did you go.

01:16:48.197 --> 01:16:49.236
I said I'd go.

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.144
I do not mean just tonight.

01:17:05.486 --> 01:17:07.380
How long you will have to

01:17:09.408 --> 01:17:11.033
I support this?

01:17:11.558 --> 01:17:13.195
I do not want to endure.

01:17:13.782 --> 01:17:14.857
I want you to love me.

01:17:14.892 --> 01:17:16.665
I love you.

01:17:17.496 --> 01:17:19.610
And try to make you happy, but

01:17:21.443 --> 01:17:23.116
I do not know what you want.

01:17:39.733 --> 01:17:41.871
I suppose I should let you go to find out.

01:17:45.805 --> 01:17:46.641
Not?

01:17:55.983 --> 01:17:57.278
- I gave the post, Daniel. - Really?

01:17:58.243 --> 01:17:59.880
What were you thinking of?

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.311
E journalist.

01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:06.686
You were wrong. There are special or different. I'm a fake.

01:18:06.721 --> 01:18:08.703
- You're a fake. - She thinks I am.

01:18:08.738 --> 01:18:12.770
Sacrificing everything to your work ever for her.

01:18:14.016 --> 01:18:17.364
You will not be ... we will not be never taken seriously.

01:18:17.399 --> 01:18:19.014
I can not lie still.

01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:23.326
I put my name, and I will not get to be a banter.

01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:25.567
Name? That's the most important?

01:18:25.602 --> 01:18:27.774
A name is everything in this business.

01:18:30.254 --> 01:18:31.317
It's all I have.

01:18:39.711 --> 01:18:40.578
I am sorry.

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:44.549
What am I gonna do now?

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:56.559
I'll fix it.

01:18:56.594 --> 01:18:57.454
How?

01:18:59.589 --> 01:19:01.532
- It's risky. - Oh God.

01:19:03.218 --> 01:19:04.452
I'm not saying I deserve it,

01:19:06.016 --> 01:19:07.885
but I ask you to trust me again.

01:19:09.999 --> 01:19:11.465
I do not know, Liam.

01:19:12.491 --> 01:19:14.764
There's a joke we do here.

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:16.120
It's probably illegal.

01:19:17.256 --> 01:19:19.663
Can we face enormous fines, and

01:19:19.698 --> 01:19:22.512
lawyers and lawsuits,

01:19:22.547 --> 01:19:23.830
maybe even jail.

01:19:23.865 --> 01:19:25.027
E ...

01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:26.826
It's art.

01:20:01.009 --> 01:20:02.854
Death is a funny business.

01:20:04.992 --> 01:20:07.083
It's all timing.

01:20:07.118 --> 01:20:09.771
Whether we like it or not, end of story

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:13.202
changing context of all anything that preceded it.

01:20:17.699 --> 01:20:20.252
What was once a love story

01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:21.963
It becomes a lie.

01:20:24.651 --> 01:20:26.031
What was once useless

01:20:27.168 --> 01:20:29.110
It becomes precious.

01:20:31.823 --> 01:20:33.436
And what was once forgotten

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.881
It can be rediscovered.

01:20:42.733 --> 01:20:46.008
Liam Price's death made me to discover a hoax.

01:20:46.839 --> 01:20:49.123
An almost perfect deception.

01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:53.057
That my life.

01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:57.498
Because, as we learned,

01:20:57.533 --> 01:21:00.121
most convincing lies

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.392
are those that we tell ourselves.

01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:13.769
McKenzie.

01:21:13.804 --> 01:21:15.123
I got the story.

01:21:16.589 --> 01:21:18.935
Not exactly what I was expecting.

01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:22.674
It's better, actually.

01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:25.924
It's complicated and challenging

01:21:25.959 --> 01:21:27.977
than anything you've written so far.

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:29.701
Your voice is progressing.

01:21:29.736 --> 01:21:31.813
This story has a signature.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.223
I'm glad to hear that.

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:37.066
How about you go back to the team?

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.875
We have a position the London office.

01:21:48.234 --> 01:21:49.883
Thank you, that's ...

01:21:52.852 --> 01:21:55.320
I think it should be independent for a while.

01:21:56.151 --> 01:21:58.717
I have a few things I must explore.

01:24:16.266 --> 01:24:19.309
Please come to my next exhibition.

01:24:49.389 --> 01:24:52.786
Whether apes and children art to glorify you,

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:55.915
Their admiration is if you like.

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:59.799
But you'll never be able talk heart to heart,

01:25:00.759 --> 01:25:04.233
unless it is born in your heart.

01:25:04.676 --> 01:25:07.934
You know, I was Liam very cute.

01:25:09.168 --> 01:25:10.529
I think we could be good friends.

01:25:12.635 --> 01:25:13.550
I doubt.

01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:17.578
Fantastic idea.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:20.038
Everyone is here. Beautiful.

01:25:21.612 --> 01:25:24.314
Commemoration. How well you thought.

01:25:30.887 --> 01:25:32.014
Pardon.

01:25:38.906 --> 01:25:39.779
Daniel.

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:42.523
Hi, McKenzie. How are you?

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:46.097
What's it about? What is this?

01:25:46.926 --> 01:25:49.245
- To what do you think? - I do not understand.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.089
Come on.

01:26:00.061 --> 01:26:02.584
Thank you all you for coming today

01:26:02.619 --> 01:26:04.735
to honor Liam's life.

01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:07.742
With an opportunity like this,

01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:10.718
I think it's important to tell the truth,

01:26:11.494 --> 01:26:15.197
and why I'm here now.

01:26:17.752 --> 01:26:22.037
Of course, I know Liam would prefer his work to speak for itself.

01:26:23.024 --> 01:26:26.385
So let me introduce you

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.382
latest posthumous works Liam's.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:32.081
Delivery from Liam Price.

01:26:32.116 --> 01:26:33.745
Wait, he's alive?

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:45.340
Can you believe that? Mocks us.

01:27:31.766 --> 01:27:32.752
So you come?

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:35.243
Of course I came.

01:27:37.766 --> 01:27:39.253
I am the biggest fan of yours.

01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:49.266
Good.

01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:00.628
Because I am yours.
