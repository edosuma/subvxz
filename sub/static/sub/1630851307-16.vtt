WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.214
Previously, on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

00:07.632 --> 00:09.551
I think it would be best
if you finish this trip

00:09.592 --> 00:11.094
and we say goodbye.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.513
I have to let you go.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.516
Considering Delaney is
still here, it's an option.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.268
It's up to you.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.811
I think it's best
it's just me and Courtney.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.354
Like, she's on the ball.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.356
I do not want the client
to feel the impact.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.607
How are you guys gonna
do it with two people?

00:24.649 --> 00:27.193
Isn't that gonna be crazy?

00:27.235 --> 00:29.863
The interior is busting
their ass, but last charter.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.740
I don't think the work
would have gotten done

00:31.781 --> 00:33.074
without the help of deck crew.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.492
I'm scared, this trip.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.535
What up?

00:35.577 --> 00:36.578
David, get out on deck.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.788
Heaving line, set up, please.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.248
You're usually the guy
I can count on

00:40.290 --> 00:42.375
to set a good
example for everyone.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.252
I feel like
I'm being condescended.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.629
I don't hold them to the same
pedestal that I hold you.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.716
Last charter, Ian Wallace
and Jemele Hill.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.594
On night one, their first
wedding anniversary.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.845
On night two...

00:57.640 --> 00:58.725
That won't be a problem, right?

00:58.767 --> 00:59.726
-Mm-hmm.
-Right?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.686
Right.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.646
I'm very excited that I've had
no complaints this season,

01:03.688 --> 01:06.149
except for Sandy's
fish, unfortunately.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.735
Local, whole roasted
black sea bass.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.403
Oh, my gosh.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.572
-Constructive criticism.
-Okay.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.240
My plate had a
lot of dark fish.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.909
This is how neurotic I am.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.411
All she did was gimme feedback,
and it's still in my head.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.913
Unfortunately, the wind's
gonna come in earlier,

01:19.954 --> 01:21.748
so we're gonna
anchor off Sibenik

01:21.790 --> 01:23.166
and receive the guests
over there.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.626
You okay?
Don't be stressed.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.503
I've got a lot
going on in my head.

01:26.544 --> 01:30.173
What's the next job...
a little bit overwhelming.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.174
Ugh!

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
[retches]

01:32.509 --> 01:33.510
What's going on?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.516
All right.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.227
[vomits]

01:43.895 --> 01:45.355
I'm sending Lloyd
ashore because

01:45.397 --> 01:46.523
his blood pressure's
really high.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.483
-Text me, all right?
-Yeah.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.693
[coughing]

02:01.871 --> 02:03.623
I could just tell
he did not look well.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.169
He doesn't know, that's why
Captain Sandy super worried.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.631
She did three goes, and
it was, like, really high.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.925
<i>All crew, all crew, come</i>
<i>meet me in the main salon.</i>

02:23.601 --> 02:25.520
As you guys, some of you,
know, or maybe all of you,

02:25.562 --> 02:27.981
Lloyd's taken ashore
because of his chest pains,

02:28.023 --> 02:30.984
and they're sending an
ambulance to take his EKG.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.652
Yeah.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.571
So, we just wanna keep
positive thoughts for Lloyd.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.741
Obviously, we want Lloyd
to be okay and return,

02:37.782 --> 02:40.326
but if he cannot,
you'll be three/three.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.703
You're gonna have less
help on the interior,

02:41.745 --> 02:43.580
and this is our last charter.

02:43.621 --> 02:47.500
So, we wanna make sure that
we can keep up our momentum.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.669
Obviously, my first
concern is Lloyd.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.423
But we literally are now hands
down in every department.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.885
When you decide to run down
a crewmember, like, by choice,

02:56.926 --> 02:59.220
that gives us
zero room for error.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.681
Now we're running
a superyacht with six crew.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.974
That's tough.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.352
Guest arrival
is around 12:00, 12:30.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.270
We're gonna board on anchor,

03:07.312 --> 03:08.772
which is the first time we've
had to do that this season.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.357
-Yeah.
-We'll be fine.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.817
Of course.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.361
All right, thank you.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.695
-Let's do this!
-Thank you.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.326
All crew, looks like there's
some provisions arriving now.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.869
Do you wanna go
make her bed quickly?

03:22.911 --> 03:26.414
I'll do the bridge and
then do toiletries after.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.541
<i>Interior, this is your</i>
<i>alcohol delivery.</i>

03:30.377 --> 03:33.004
When I chose to go
down to two stews,

03:33.046 --> 03:36.549
I didn't really consider
losing a deckhand as well.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.511
The plan right now
is to survive.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.431
-Coco?
-Mow.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.557
Ooh, what a sad kitty.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.351
[laughing]

03:46.393 --> 03:48.812
<i>All crew, all crew, 30 minutes</i>
<i>until guest arrival.</i>

03:55.110 --> 03:56.653
So, once the guests come aboard,

03:56.695 --> 03:58.405
luggage, all that,
same as usual.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.948
Everything's done top to bottom.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.491
Yeah.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.034
If the guests use water
toys, like, a bunch,

04:03.076 --> 04:04.828
we'll have to focus on that
before helping interior.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.038
I'm just gonna
take Lloyd's watch.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.541
You'll be on deck in
the morning by yourself.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.751
I've had my down point,
so to speak,

04:11.793 --> 04:13.712
but now is when
I want them to see me

04:13.753 --> 04:15.880
be there to help them
wherever I can...

04:15.922 --> 04:18.049
interior, exterior, everywhere.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.343
I want to be there and
I wanna push us through.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.931
Yes.

04:24.973 --> 04:25.974
Katie, do we need to go?

04:26.016 --> 04:27.642
I'm gonna take them up.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.977
And then I'll bring
the bread up there.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.895
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>please proceed</i>

04:30.937 --> 04:32.772
<i>to the aft deck for</i>
<i>guest arrival.</i>

04:32.814 --> 04:34.315
Copy.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.443
Everybody listen...
what side we getting on?

04:36.484 --> 04:37.986
Wrong!

04:42.365 --> 04:43.700
En garde!

04:43.742 --> 04:44.868
[laughing]

04:44.909 --> 04:47.662
6'5"!
From Michigan State!

04:47.704 --> 04:50.623
-Wait, who is 6'5"?
-Who's 6'5"?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.875
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

04:51.916 --> 04:54.044
-Hi, welcome.
-Wonderful, thank you!

04:54.085 --> 04:56.129
I'm Sandy, your captain.
Welcome aboard.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.130
Michael.
This is my wife, Crystal.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.715
-Hi, Katie.
-Katie.

04:58.757 --> 04:59.966
Hi, I'm Mat, nice to meet you.

05:00.008 --> 05:00.967
Most important man over here.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.427
Hi, I'm Mat.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.471
Nice to meet you too, I'm Katie.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.638
Welcome.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.057
Champagne, anybody?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.892
We're hoping the weather
holds out for you.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.852
Katie will show you around,
and then we're on our way.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.815
-Hey!
-Let's get it!

05:15.857 --> 05:17.067
Follow me, guys.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.860
So, this our sundeck.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.653
I'm so looking forward to
this part... the hot tub.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.821
-Uh-huh.
-Yes.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.989
-That's everything?
-Yeah.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.492
So, this is our
bridge deck salon.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.410
-Do you have cigars?
-We do.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.037
We need it quickly...

05:29.079 --> 05:30.830
this is when having that extra
stewardess would come in handy.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.582
So in here, we have a day head.

05:32.624 --> 05:33.750
What's it called?
"Day head?"

05:33.792 --> 05:35.043
Yeah.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.004
I gotta go test
this day head real quick.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.673
And this is the primary cabin.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.966
Y'all can stop looking.
What is wrong with you?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.718
I can't.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.096
My wife of one year... soon.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.472
-Mwah!
-Yes, happy anniversary, guys!

05:47.514 --> 05:48.723
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

05:48.765 --> 05:49.891
Now is the perfect
time to celebrate.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.017
Did you guys wanna
see the galley?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.644
Yes.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.604
This is where all
the magic happens.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.022
How's it going?
This is my spot.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.652
So, the first meal
I'm gonna do family style,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.028
and then after that
we can do plated.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.072
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.532
We'll let you know how
it tastes a little bit later.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.533
-Please do.
-We sure will.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.701
You know, game on.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.829
Coming up on the transom.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.836
Oh, yeah, I need
some day head.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.713
[laughing]

06:19.754 --> 06:20.714
Anchor's home.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.465
Great, we're good to go.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.012
Look at my queen.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.767
We got this.
We got this.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.771
We got this.
We got this.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.524
Oh, just trying to get
the other started.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.567
-Man!
-I need to see this picture.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.568
-Oh, you got...
-[glass breaks]

06:41.609 --> 06:43.069
Oh, yeah.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.654
-Oh!
-Five dollars.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.614
You can't even say
you was drunk, girl.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.074
-Five dollars please.
-They got very animated.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.534
I'm on my way.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.078
These guests seem a bit rowdy.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.122
And obviously, it's two
of us, so [bleep].

06:54.164 --> 06:55.707
I'm a little bit scared.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.083
We have some clothes
that might need steam.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.918
-Yeah, if you just...
-Yeah.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.463
-lay them out on the bed, what
you would prefer to be steamed.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.006
They're gonna be rowdy,
that's for sure.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.549
There's a lot of them, Katie.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.177
-No worries.
-Okay.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.845
They want some stuff steamed,

07:08.887 --> 07:10.680
and I'm getting really
freaked out that

07:10.722 --> 07:13.099
it's gonna be, like,
a [bleep] load.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.100
I'm gonna see if they
need help with anything.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.769
Yeah, nice.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.563
I'm gonna get changed quick.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
Yo, if you guys need
a quick hand anywhere...

07:25.320 --> 07:26.821
you want me to wash while
you do something else?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.239
Yeah, sure, thanks.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.617
Can we have
two 1942s on the rocks?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.202
Yes. As soon as you guys
are ready, though,

07:32.243 --> 07:33.787
you can sit at the table and
I can start with drinks.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.788
And then we'll start
bringing food up.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.039
All right. Yes.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.957
-You wanna sit next to Jemele?
-I can.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.709
Okay, do you guys
need help anywhere else?

07:39.751 --> 07:41.961
No, I think we're good,
thank you, though.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.838
ETA 28 minutes.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.964
Would you like still
or sparkling?

07:45.006 --> 07:46.966
Still.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.844
I get insecure
whenever I get criticism,

07:49.886 --> 07:52.305
even if it's the smallest thing.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.890
Like, all I can think
about is that piece of fish

07:53.932 --> 07:55.684
I served Sandy.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.102
All right, we're gonna
start with fusilli with shrimp

07:57.143 --> 07:59.020
and local skarpina.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.731
So, we're gonna hit them with
this Mediterranean style fish,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.274
and hopefully I can
get my head out

08:03.316 --> 08:05.527
of only thinking
about brown fish.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.153
To start...

08:07.195 --> 08:08.154
-Okay.
-Here we go.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.656
Oh, yay!

08:09.698 --> 08:11.199
We have some blackened
local skarpina

08:11.241 --> 08:14.160
with a pineapple salsa, fusilli
with garlic and shrimp...

08:14.202 --> 08:15.537
Yeah, that's what
we were smelling.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.663
Oh, yes, yes!

08:16.705 --> 08:18.039
Got trash?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.582
I do, both of them.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.880
I have arugula with parmesan,
pine nuts, and avo.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.596
Then we have some zucchini
fries with ranch dressing.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.223
Enjoy, guys!

08:35.265 --> 08:36.725
I'm gonna go ahead
and try this.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.185
Can I get some of
that salad, too?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.854
Oh, my blessings are.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.565
No disrespect, but the fish
is, like, mad bland.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.066
It is.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.901
It looked like it was
gonna be spicy or something,

08:46.943 --> 08:48.778
-it's way bland, yeah.
-It's actually kinda bland.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.196
Katie, you have any,
like, hot sauce?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.781
Katie, the food
is generally good,

08:51.823 --> 08:52.949
but the fish is, like, bland.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.284
Okay.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.577
Yeah, we need some more
flavor on the fish.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.619
-Just a little bit more.
-Okay.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.704
Yeah.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.247
I can let Mathew know.
[bleep]

08:59.289 --> 09:01.374
I know that going
to tell Mathew this,

09:01.416 --> 09:03.251
I'm not gonna get
a good reaction.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.794
All right,
we gonna try this green.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.379
But at the end of the day,

09:06.421 --> 09:09.049
I'm just trying to do my job,
and he needs to do his.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.675
[phone vibrates]

09:11.676 --> 09:13.136
Hi, this is Sandy.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.846
<i>Hi, Captain Sandy,</i>
<i>it's Dr. Sarah Belson.</i>

09:14.888 --> 09:17.223
<i>I just wanna give you</i>
<i>the update on Lloyd.</i>

09:17.265 --> 09:18.266
Are they happy?

09:18.308 --> 09:20.685
Um...

09:28.443 --> 09:28.943
Hi, this is Sandy.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.238
<i>Hi, Captain Sandy,</i>
<i>it's Dr. Sarah Belson.</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:33.865
<i>I just wanna give you</i>
<i>the update on Lloyd.</i>

09:33.907 --> 09:35.283
Okay.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.286
<i>So, the ambulance came,</i>
<i>they did the EKG,</i>

09:38.328 --> 09:39.954
<i>and everything is in order.</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:42.957
<i>I'm going to observe</i>
<i>him in an hour,</i>

09:42.999 --> 09:44.292
<i>and then we'll see</i>
<i>where we go from there.</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:45.710
Okay, great.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.087
All right, well,
that's good news.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.213
Do they know what
caused his chest pains

09:48.254 --> 09:49.714
and why was he vomiting?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.800
<i>It was a panic attack.</i>

09:51.841 --> 09:52.926
-Okay.
<i>-But he's doing fine now.</i>

09:52.967 --> 09:53.927
-Okay, great.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

09:53.968 --> 09:55.053
All right.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.680
I'm so relieved,
knowing that

09:56.721 --> 09:57.764
Lloyd's feeling better
and he's okay.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.683
-Thank you.
-No problem.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.935
I know we're short-handed,
but I would like for Lloyd

10:01.976 --> 10:03.436
to get a good night's sleep

10:03.478 --> 10:04.813
and then join the vessel
first thing in the morning.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.064
I don't wanna rush him.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.065
<i>-Bye-bye.</i>
-Okay, bye.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.858
Are they happy?

10:08.900 --> 10:11.361
They said they like everything,
the fish needs more flavor.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.445
The fish needs more flavor.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.988
-Yeah.
-Okay. Sorry.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.824
So, they're going to... I
just...

10:15.865 --> 10:17.075
they're going to
be these people.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.411
-Yeah.
-On everything.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.121
I mean, we're not perfect.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.833
-Fish needs more flavor.
-Yeah.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.001
I'ma still eat it, though.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.293
I just wanna cry.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.005
Well, you can cry
in three days, okay?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.840
I know, look, three days.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.218
I thought that every
----ing piece was perfect.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.845
But hey, what do I know?

10:36.886 --> 10:38.388
Sorry I ruined the charter.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.849
Shut up.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.225
<i>Mzi, towels up to the sundeck.</i>

10:44.769 --> 10:46.146
You wanna go change?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.731
You gonna have
to take me there.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.279
Okay.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.866
-You can drop the anchor.
-Copy.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.117
That is five
at the waterline.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.493
Lock it down there,
lock it down.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.745
Thank you very much.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.080
Same, bru.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.502
Deck crew, deck crew,
all toys out.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.469
-Bye forever.
-Bye forever.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.928
-Hi!
-Hey, how you doing?

11:18.970 --> 11:20.138
Good, how are you?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
I'm trying to find me a suit.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.557
A suit?
Yeah.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.809
We've got two XL on
that shelf there.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.519
-We'll see y'all in a minute.
-Yeah, nice.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.313
Such a ----ing idiot.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.316
Oh!

11:33.109 --> 11:34.903
Just don't breathe.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.446
That was a damn workout.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.781
It's the most work you'll
have to do all trip.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.074
Whew.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.241
And yeah, we have to get
you a lifejacket.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.453
Good!

11:43.495 --> 11:45.163
You going hunting?
You going hunting?

11:45.205 --> 11:48.166
Yeah, you got me...
I feel like a crossing guard.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.424
Bridge, bridge,
that is jet-skis away.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.390
David will give you a
little rundown on the hydrofoil.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.396
In hindsight,
it would be nice

12:09.437 --> 12:11.064
to have an extra
person on board.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.565
These guests and the water toys,

12:12.607 --> 12:15.944
I'd call it a 10
out of 10 for effort.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.153
-Oh!
-There he goes!

12:17.195 --> 12:19.531
[laughing]

12:19.572 --> 12:22.200
One out of 10
for natural ability.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.411
It's an accident
waiting to happen.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.870
That's it,
now a bit of acceleration,

12:25.912 --> 12:28.415
and then try and get...
there we go.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.457
No, try and get yourself...

12:29.499 --> 12:31.918
[laughing]

12:42.053 --> 12:43.638
It's a hard toy.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.348
We're not going to have
breaks this trip.

12:51.938 --> 12:52.939
Best night ever?

12:52.981 --> 12:54.065
Is a lie.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.150
Oh, really?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.526
A little more seasoning.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.153
Y'all see Ronnie's lifejacket?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.320
Oh, man.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.031
I had the crossing
guard jacket on.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.203
Finally was like this, like...

13:08.204 --> 13:09.414
he had it up and everything.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.999
No, it wasn't.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.667
When we put that helmet
on, it was like...

13:12.709 --> 13:14.377
-Coming up.
-Coming up.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.587
So crazy, huh?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.172
Thank God it's our last charter.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.548
Are you keeping the swim ladder?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.342
Yeah.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.093
I was thinking because we have
one person in the morning.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.262
All right, stage two,
coming in.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.182
Stage two in.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.020
Mm-hmm.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.148
Yeah.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.193
I don't know.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.570
I just choked on olives.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.530
Yeah, can you not
die on me?

13:42.572 --> 13:43.948
I'm gonna need you.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.577
To the cabins.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.705
It's looking good at the bow.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.082
Look at that, hon...

13:52.123 --> 13:53.375
they have your suit
already pressed.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.335
Oh sh--. Hell yeah.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.550
You got, like, a...

14:02.592 --> 14:03.551
You ready?

14:03.593 --> 14:04.969
All ready?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.554
Watch the back.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.434
That's good, that's good.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.565
Are you?

14:17.607 --> 14:21.152
Because we're here to start a
party and take the drama away

14:21.194 --> 14:22.946
You need to write this down.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.239
I know, I do,
I'm gonna start writing it.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.407
Okay, do you wanna
go get changed?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.577
All right, well done, Mzi.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.621
The anniversary balloons
are beautiful.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.997
Yeah, they're cool, hey?

14:33.039 --> 14:34.290
Yeah.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.298
I love it when a vision
comes to life, you know?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.759
Woo, look at them Eaves!

14:44.801 --> 14:46.428
They clean up so nice,
look at them.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.971
-Nice.
-We're all Gucci.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.764
Oh, my God,
you guys look amazing.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.974
All right.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.350
Let's get into epaulettes.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.102
I heard you're not
joining us this evening.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.395
-Tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.105
-Hello, Captain Sandy.
-Hi.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.777
Hey, now,
what's this, 44 medium?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.320
Like, what size is that?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.197
Are you guys hungry?
Shall we seat?

15:06.239 --> 15:09.409
Galley, galley, gonna seat the
guests and water and wine them.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.452
Copy that.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.165
I'll get one of the deck crew
to turn it up.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.045
I like how you guys
are all in white.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.255
Yeah.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.465
It's a vibe.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.592
-Happy anniversary!
-Thank you!

15:25.633 --> 15:28.261
<i>Hey, Malia, can we turn</i>
<i>the hot tub up for later?</i>

15:28.303 --> 15:29.387
Yes.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.806
Oh, wait...
are you busy?

15:31.848 --> 15:32.807
Yeah.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.808
Can I wear my jacket?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.352
Yeah.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.228
You know what would
make me really happy,

15:37.270 --> 15:40.482
if the hot tub
spontaneously got super hot.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.150
[sighs]

15:42.192 --> 15:44.319
Just went to the bathroom.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.154
Okay, please call it
the bathroom.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.155
What do they say in New Zealand?

15:47.197 --> 15:48.281
What do they call a bathroom?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.491
I can't say it.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.076
-It's that bad?
-No, it's bad.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.827
-The pisser.
-Yeah, thank you.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.163
-Oh.
-We're ready when you are.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.623
Courtney, I'm plating
right now.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.333
I don't know if it's the
size of the boat,

15:58.375 --> 16:00.210
but you can always smell
what's going on in the kitchen.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.211
Yeah.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.504
Surf-and-turf for dinner, right?

16:02.545 --> 16:03.755
-Yeah.
-Is that good or bad for you?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.423
We gonna see when
this food arrives.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.095
Stop being an asshole!

16:10.136 --> 16:12.180
Grilled filet mignon,
butter poached lobster,

16:12.222 --> 16:13.723
red wine demi-glace.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.268
Butter poached lobster,
filet mignon.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.479
So for tonight, filet mignon,

16:19.521 --> 16:22.107
butter-poached lobster,
and a demi red sauce.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.358
Thank you.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.401
That's what we had
at our wedding.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.568
-Oh!
-Really?

16:25.610 --> 16:27.195
I'm not even kidding.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.239
Wow, there you go.

16:33.785 --> 16:37.247
Mm.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.331
-Hi!
-Hey.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.300
How's your dinner?

16:51.428 --> 16:52.762
It's fantastic.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.805
The lobster's delicious.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.849
-Awesome.
-Really good.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.684
What the chef didn't know
is butter-poached lobster,

16:57.726 --> 16:58.685
that's what we
had at our wedding.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.270
Oh, wow.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.396
So I was like, oh, my
goodness, did they...

17:01.438 --> 17:02.397
I don't think they knew this.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.773
The clients love his food.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.608
Again, Mathew's been riding
a roller coaster

17:05.650 --> 17:07.235
throughout the entire season.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.445
I'm freaking out.
I wanna get an MRI.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.238
Mat.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.448
You make things that
I didn't know that I wanted.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.907
I'm done.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.160
I needed to come back.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.202
-Mathew.
-Yeah.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.788
The cuisine was exquisite.

17:18.830 --> 17:19.873
I burned the [bleep]
outta my finger.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.666
Your saving grace, right there.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.460
-Mat's food was ridiculous.
-We're gonna kidnap him.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.503
I wanna end on a high note,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.213
considering everything
we've been through together.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.799
And I think we're headed
in that direction.

17:29.841 --> 17:30.800
Are they happy?

17:30.842 --> 17:32.469
Thank you very much.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.845
They said this is what they
ate at their wedding,

17:33.887 --> 17:34.846
and it's their
wedding anniversary.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.431
Really?

17:36.473 --> 17:37.807
Butter-poached lobster
and filet mignon.

17:37.849 --> 17:38.933
Thank God.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.727
Back in their good graces.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.314
Baby tomatoes, sautéed wild
mushrooms, grilled asparagi.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.484
Grilled asparagus,
roasted tomatoes,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.736
and sautéed wild mushrooms.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.654
Were you pretty hands-on
with the wedding?

17:54.532 --> 17:55.742
'Cause you particular.

17:55.784 --> 17:56.785
I don't like
the way that sounds.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.953
[laughing]

17:58.995 --> 18:00.455
All right.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.291
-I can help.
-First cupboard on the right.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.584
Thank you, Dave-O.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.586
Now, let's clean up
this mess, yeah?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.672
Yeah, I'm about to.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.507
Oh.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.509
It's around-the-clock
for deck crew.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.512
We're doing all of our deck
responsibilities down one,

18:15.553 --> 18:16.971
we're helping with laundry,

18:17.013 --> 18:19.474
with service, with cleaning,

18:19.516 --> 18:21.309
with washing,
with the galley.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.478
It's... it's been a lot.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.648
Look at you!

18:26.690 --> 18:27.649
Look, Katie, I hate
to tell you this...

18:27.691 --> 18:28.775
we gonna be up a while.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.026
-That's fine.
-Yeah.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.487
She's like, "I hate y'all."

18:32.529 --> 18:34.864
-So, we changing out the white?
-Yes.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.741
Yeah, I'm changing
out the white.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.833
They were just like, "Katie,
we hate to tell you this,

18:44.874 --> 18:46.418
but we're gonna be up a while."

18:47.669 --> 18:48.628
-What is this?
-Katie!

18:48.670 --> 18:50.547
We need drink orders.

18:50.588 --> 18:51.548
Gin with some grapefruit juice.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.841
Vodka-tonic.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.759
-Grey Goose tonic.
-Cîroc and tonic.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.927
-And tonic?
-Red Bull?

18:55.969 --> 18:56.970
-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you.

18:57.012 --> 18:57.971
Oh, this is gonna
be good.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.014
[bleep] me.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.891
What do they want?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.059
Everything.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.895
Go to sleep.
Save yourself.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.943
-Thank you.
-Yeah, cool.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.076
Katie, I need a shot.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.996
No sleep for Katie.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.748
This is a tight game over here.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.332
Janeiro, you want
another drink?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.918
Katie, I think Janeiro
would like another.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.673
Woo!

19:40.805 --> 19:42.390
Go on, then.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.433
Hey [bleep].

19:43.475 --> 19:44.809
Wassup?

19:44.851 --> 19:47.395
Does that say crazy wind?

19:50.648 --> 19:52.567
Sleep well.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.568
Hey.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.320
Gosh, you gave me a fright.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.989
-We doing one game or three?
-Three! Best outta three.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.327
No, no, no, you
can just dry.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.496
-Okay.
-And we can...

20:04.537 --> 20:07.457
[phone rings]

20:07.499 --> 20:08.625
How you feeling, dude?

20:08.667 --> 20:09.834
<i>Bit better.</i>

20:11.169 --> 20:12.962
<i>I just had a</i>
<i>like a panic attack.</i>

20:13.004 --> 20:14.547
<i>Feel a bit of an idiot.</i>

20:14.589 --> 20:16.633
No, not at all.
You're missed back here.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.009
<i>-Anyway...</i>
-The cabin's very lonely.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.803
Lloyd is probably one
of the ----ing purest

20:19.844 --> 20:21.638
human beings I've ever met.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.932
It's difficult to find
people like that, I think,

20:23.973 --> 20:25.350
especially in first season.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.893
I need him to be fine.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.603
<i>I should be coming</i>
<i>back in tomorrow morning,</i>

20:28.645 --> 20:30.355
<i>so I'll catch you</i>
<i>later on, man.</i>

20:30.397 --> 20:31.398
All right, cheers, Uncle.

20:33.858 --> 20:38.113
* Sister Katie *

20:39.906 --> 20:42.367
I was the one that chose
to only have two stews.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.619
I think I'm in
an impossible situation

20:44.661 --> 20:46.162
that I guess
I can blame myself for.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.373
But I still stand
by my decision

20:48.415 --> 20:49.916
and it's on me
to prove myself right.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.167
Hey, Katie.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.919
We gonna do a breakfast
at 10:00 a.m.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.671
Oh, okay.

20:54.713 --> 20:55.672
Yeah, that's fine,
we'll be ready for you

20:55.714 --> 20:57.173
whenever.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.717
Okay.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.968
I think I got my work
cut out for me here.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.136
-Good night, guys!
-Thank you.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.887
I hope you sleep well.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.572
[alarm sounds]

21:30.040 --> 21:31.875
This is gonna be the weather
here all day today.

21:31.916 --> 21:32.917
Oh, really?

21:32.959 --> 21:33.918
Is Lloyd coming back?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.420
I think so.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.047
He's texted me saying
he feels better.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.465
We need his goosiness.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.467
We need him for
the talent show.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.427
[alarm sounds]

21:46.056 --> 21:47.932
It's gonna get real windy.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.228
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.688
I guess I'm the first one up.

21:53.730 --> 21:54.981
I think you are, yeah.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.566
Can I get you
a coffee or anything?

21:56.608 --> 21:57.984
-Coffee's good.
-How do you like it?

21:58.026 --> 21:59.027
Cream and sugar.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.570
Interior, interior, Malia.

22:00.612 --> 22:01.821
Go ahead.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.114
Ronnie is awake and
he would like

22:03.156 --> 22:05.450
a black coffee
with cream and sugar.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.785
Lovely, thank you.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.582
Playa, come on out here, queen.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.125
-Good morning.
-What up?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.251
What's good?

22:15.293 --> 22:17.170
You know, chillin' in Croatia.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.922
-Katie!
-Good morning!

22:18.963 --> 22:19.923
How did we sleep?

22:19.964 --> 22:21.216
-Katie!
-Good morning.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.217
-Good morning.
-Are you guys hungry?

22:22.258 --> 22:23.635
Because breakfast is set up top.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.844
Thank you.

22:24.886 --> 22:25.887
What day do you fly out?

22:28.223 --> 22:29.557
That's nice.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.059
I cannot wait for
this all to end

22:31.101 --> 22:32.769
so that I can just be at
the Split house with everyone.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.688
Like, I don't know how it
will be when we actually

22:34.729 --> 22:35.939
finish the season,
but I'm hoping

22:35.980 --> 22:37.816
that we'll all still
like each other.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.654
I... we'll have to move
the jet-skis at some point.

22:42.696 --> 22:43.780
So, I just wanted
to see if you guys

22:43.822 --> 22:45.073
wanted to get out there at all.

22:45.115 --> 22:46.533
No.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.993
Sh--'s choppy out there.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.663
I think tomorrow will be
a better day for water sports.

22:51.705 --> 22:54.499
Excuse me, some fruit.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.127
Rainy days are like the
interior's worst nightmare.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.130
The guests are inside 24/7,
and they want things 24/7,

23:00.171 --> 23:02.215
and I definitely
need the deck team

23:02.257 --> 23:05.010
to help me keep the guests
as entertained as possible.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.681
Brioche French toast
with a strawberry sauce.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.726
Katie, what kind of
activities can we do today?

23:12.767 --> 23:14.519
We've got some golf
clubs in there,

23:14.561 --> 23:15.895
and we were gonna
set up the laz,

23:15.937 --> 23:17.647
maybe make it
a bit of competition,

23:17.689 --> 23:19.190
since you guys like
a bit of competition.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.067
Okay, okay.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.069
Now, are you guys aware of the
competition we put on you all?

23:23.111 --> 23:26.906
I don't know if any of us
have that many talents, so...

23:26.948 --> 23:28.283
We gonna see.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.203
Yeah, this French toast
is good.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.580
Yeah, it is.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.707
Lloyd, you're back!

23:35.749 --> 23:39.044
-Welcome back!
-How are you?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.712
-How are you doing?
-Much better.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.339
Thank God.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.592
I am very relieved, not just
because we need him on deck,

23:45.633 --> 23:47.552
but I was worried about him.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.179
Bring that happy back.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.680
-We missed the goosiness.
-Yeah, ready to smash it out.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.057
Yeah!

23:52.098 --> 23:53.808
Yeah, there you go,
there you go.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.185
All crew, all crew, Lloyd
has made it back on board.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.853
-Woo!
-So happy you're back!

23:56.895 --> 23:58.772
We just got
an extra crewmember!

24:00.273 --> 24:01.733
Coming up...

24:01.775 --> 24:03.318
I taste all kinds of
beets up in here.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.572
Mat, she's asked questions.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.325
I can't stand beets.
This is, like, no.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.291
-You feel good?
-So much better, thanks, yeah.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.418
All right, awesome.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.087
-Well, bring that happy back.
-Yeah.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.880
All crew, all crew,
Lloyd has made it back on board.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.215
-Woo!
-So happy you're back!

24:32.389 --> 24:35.225
<i>I'm just turning up</i>
<i>the lower guest cabins.</i>

24:35.266 --> 24:37.268
<i>If anybody's available,</i>
<i>that would be great.</i>

24:37.310 --> 24:38.311
Can't right now honey.

24:39.688 --> 24:40.730
Where you at, playboy?

24:40.772 --> 24:41.981
Let me see what you got, son.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.316
<i>Courtney, on my way.</i>

24:43.358 --> 24:44.651
Thank you, angel.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.363
-One for you.
-Thank you.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.781
This just has to do.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.826
Yeah, let's go.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.994
All right, so you gonna
play for your tip money?

24:55.036 --> 24:56.287
He's playing for tip money.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.957
Z, what are you doing?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.959
Wait, is this for money
or is this...

25:01.001 --> 25:02.419
We ain't gonna do that to Mzi.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.129
Oh, I just wanna,
like, reorganize this room.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.964
I have too much OCD
for this sh--.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.800
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:08.842 --> 25:09.926
You smoke in the rain?

25:09.968 --> 25:11.011
Yeah.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.724
Ooh!

25:15.765 --> 25:17.142
Oh, Z got me.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.937
Oh! Oh!

25:20.979 --> 25:24.774
-What... get it! oh!
-Oh.

25:24.816 --> 25:25.817
That's long.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.194
Ooh!

25:28.236 --> 25:29.320
Quiet like this is
a real tournament.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.698
-Oh, it's going in.
-Oh!

25:31.740 --> 25:33.241
Hey, David, gimme
an honest answer...

25:33.283 --> 25:35.118
does Z be hustling people
every charter down here?

25:38.913 --> 25:40.165
[laughing]

25:50.884 --> 25:53.053
-Hat tip, way to go, Z.
-All right.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.721
-Hey.
-I'll put this out.

25:54.763 --> 25:56.097
No, you don't have to,
come over here.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.390
-Oh...
-Don't put your cigarette out.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.018
Come under here,
where it's nice and dry.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.872
We changed it up.

26:20.914 --> 26:21.873
-Playing...
-Dice.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.249
Gamble all this.

26:23.291 --> 26:24.876
Katie, can I get a
double vodka on the rocks?

26:24.918 --> 26:26.503
-Sure.
-Make that two.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.421
Let's do her another
Red Bull and vodka.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.215
-Tequila.
-Don Julio.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.383
Ah snap.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.093
Katie, where your
pen and pad at?

26:33.134 --> 26:34.344
-She don't need one.
-I've got a brain.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.887
I got a dollar Katie
get this wrong.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.889
They are trying to break me,

26:37.931 --> 26:40.308
and the fact that they
are trying to break me

26:40.350 --> 26:44.562
is like giving me enough
energy to push through.

26:44.604 --> 26:45.814
Who's in, everybody?

26:45.855 --> 26:47.107
Yeah, we all in.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.359
Because I do not step down
to a challenge.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.236
What?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.237
Is that Lloyd?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.530
I thought I smelled a Lloyd.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.411
Yeah, cheers, man.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.579
I'm feeling a lot better
now, thanks.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.040
Vodka-tonic,
vodka on the rocks,

27:04.082 --> 27:06.918
vodka-Red Bull,
Cîroc tonic with two limes.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.961
Ooh!

27:08.003 --> 27:09.087
Two limes!

27:09.129 --> 27:10.088
No, I wanted one lime.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.089
-No!
-No!

27:11.131 --> 27:12.590
No!

27:12.632 --> 27:14.259
I'll take my dollar bill,
thank you very much.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.053
Ooh! Katie!

27:19.973 --> 27:21.307
[yawns]

27:24.853 --> 27:25.979
Yeah.

27:26.021 --> 27:27.022
[mumbles]

27:27.063 --> 27:29.357
I have no displayable talents.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.276
I can't...

27:31.317 --> 27:34.154
like, if I'm drunk enough,
I'm quite a good karaoke singer,

27:34.195 --> 27:36.364
and it's pretty much "Aladdin"
or "The Lion King."

27:36.406 --> 27:37.949
That's where I kind of stop.

27:42.287 --> 27:44.122
Oh, dear.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.833
Dinner prep time.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.085
After the rocky start,
the train is getting back

27:49.127 --> 27:50.170
on the tracks a little bit now.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.630
But this meal, Sandy's there.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.299
Her last time eating
with the guests

27:54.341 --> 27:56.509
was not the perfect dinner.

27:56.551 --> 27:59.054
It puts me in a little bit
of a headspace again.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.601
-You okay?
-I'm just, like, meh.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.269
I've got a rap.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.896
-You do?
-Yeah.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.314
-Do you wanna split it up?
-Yeah.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.857
I thought I could be,
like, a gangsta chick.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.320
Do you guys want
me to take over,

28:15.362 --> 28:16.404
and you go grab
some food and change?

28:16.446 --> 28:18.531
That would be pretty wonderful.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.248
* We got Ronnie here,
rocking the safety vest *

28:27.290 --> 28:29.959
* With Ian over here,
only wearing his best *

28:30.001 --> 28:30.960
Z's going first.

28:31.002 --> 28:32.504
No, what do you mean?

28:32.545 --> 28:34.172
* Hope you have a
sick time on Lady Michelle *

28:34.214 --> 28:35.340
* Because when
it's time to leave *

28:35.382 --> 28:37.092
* We don't want you to yell *

28:37.133 --> 28:39.886
Do we know if they're
having soup for a starter?

28:39.928 --> 28:41.137
Soup?

28:41.179 --> 28:42.555
Is there an English
joke in there?

28:42.597 --> 28:43.973
-Well, yeah.
<i>-Galley, galley, Lloyd.</i>

28:44.015 --> 28:45.183
<i>Go for galley.</i>

28:45.225 --> 28:46.601
What's the starter?

28:46.643 --> 28:48.019
Yeah, I don't wanna kick
you in the [bleep].

28:48.061 --> 28:50.397
[laughing]

28:52.232 --> 28:53.900
Copy.

28:53.942 --> 28:57.028
We have, like, funny things,
but no one does, like...

28:57.070 --> 28:59.239
It's kind of a weird thing
to ask crew to do,

28:59.280 --> 29:02.325
because we're not there
to, like, be your entertainment,

29:02.367 --> 29:04.119
we're there to do our jobs.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.620
I mean, if any of us had
a really good talent,

29:05.662 --> 29:07.247
we wouldn't be in
yachting, would we?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.334
Lead the way.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.544
Good evening, I actually
haven't met everyone here yet.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.670
So, my name's Lloyd.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.296
I'm going to be
the mc for this.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.090
These are your scorecards
for this evening.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.925
So, I thought we'd
just start off with

29:18.967 --> 29:21.386
a little bit of English slang,
a way of communicating

29:21.428 --> 29:23.221
without members of
management understanding

29:23.263 --> 29:24.389
what you're talking about.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.725
[laughing]

29:26.766 --> 29:30.478
This afternoon I went out
to look for an Uncle Bert...

29:30.520 --> 29:31.730
a shirt.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.064
But I got distracted
and I went in

29:33.106 --> 29:34.983
and had a couple
of pig's ears...

29:35.025 --> 29:37.569
-beers.
-Beer.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.405
And then that leads us
into our first act for today.

29:40.447 --> 29:43.116
He's gonna be playing
with his cobbler's alls...

29:43.158 --> 29:44.993
Balls.

29:45.035 --> 29:49.247
But this time it's gonna be his
golf balls, so I introduce Mzi.

29:49.289 --> 29:51.249
-Woo!
-Yeah!

29:56.296 --> 29:58.214
-Whoa!
-Yeah!

29:58.256 --> 30:01.468
The next lady that's coming
out is my boss, Malia.

30:03.178 --> 30:05.597
Hey!

30:05.638 --> 30:07.140
Heads, shoulders,
knees and toes!

30:07.182 --> 30:09.059
[shouting]

30:09.100 --> 30:11.519
We've got another seven,
and another eight.

30:11.561 --> 30:14.481
So, the next person is David.
He's from the town of Plymouth.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.232
I'm not a very
talented individual

30:16.274 --> 30:17.776
as far as audience
stuff goes, right?

30:17.817 --> 30:21.529
But juggling...
I also can't do.

30:21.571 --> 30:24.616
Right, so I do have one thing

30:24.657 --> 30:27.410
I think I can do that you can't.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.079
Oh!

30:29.120 --> 30:30.288
Yeah!

30:30.330 --> 30:32.290
An eight, a nine, a
seven, a 10!

30:32.332 --> 30:35.043
These girls are gonna rap,
so state your name, girls.

30:35.085 --> 30:36.503
Katie and Coco.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.129
And what are you doing today?

30:38.171 --> 30:39.339
Rappin'!

30:39.381 --> 30:41.216
Fire in the pot!

30:41.257 --> 30:43.093
* We're here on the yacht
and we been doing a lot *

30:43.134 --> 30:45.595
* We got jet-skis on the stern,
so you can all take your turn *

30:45.637 --> 30:48.515
* We had Ronnie out there,
rockin' the safety vest *

30:48.556 --> 30:51.643
* And with Ian over here,
only wearin' his best *

30:53.728 --> 30:57.315
* We got Katie and Coco
in the interior *

30:57.357 --> 31:00.151
* But with a little help
from the exterior *

31:00.193 --> 31:02.320
* We hope you have a sick
time on Lady Michelle *

31:02.362 --> 31:03.822
* 'Cause when
it's time to leave, *

31:03.863 --> 31:05.031
* We don't want you to yell *

31:05.073 --> 31:06.241
Woo!

31:06.282 --> 31:08.034
I'm cringing.
Like, I am...

31:08.076 --> 31:09.661
I can't. Like, I actually...
I just can't.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.371
I don't know how this
is happening right now.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.498
I'm just happy that
the guests are happy.

31:16.418 --> 31:18.545
No, I'm gonna leave it
up to the OGs.

31:18.586 --> 31:21.131
Dr. Dre can...
he can have this one, you know?

31:21.172 --> 31:22.382
Peace!

31:23.383 --> 31:24.342
Woo!

31:24.384 --> 31:25.468
Yeah, yeah!

31:25.510 --> 31:26.511
Woo, woo!

31:26.553 --> 31:27.637
Ten, 10!

31:27.679 --> 31:30.265
Oh!

31:30.306 --> 31:33.518
-Woo!
-Yeah!

31:33.560 --> 31:34.728
Coming up...

31:34.769 --> 31:36.688
Oh, you gotta be
----ing kidding me.

31:36.730 --> 31:38.523
I've broken, like
----ing 10 yolks.

31:47.824 --> 31:48.950
When you guys are ready,
we can sit at the table.

31:49.868 --> 31:50.869
Let's go.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.120
Is this where I'm sitting?

31:52.162 --> 31:53.371
You know it.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.250
Still.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.753
Katie, you did such a
nice job on your table décor.

31:59.794 --> 32:01.129
It's so beautiful.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.297
Thank you.

32:02.339 --> 32:03.506
This is such
a pretty setting.

32:03.548 --> 32:05.175
Katie, should I
start freaking out?

32:05.216 --> 32:06.509
Yeah.

32:06.551 --> 32:08.136
If it can't be
a perfect season,

32:08.178 --> 32:09.929
at least it's gotta be
a perfect dinner.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.765
<i>Courtney, Courtney.</i>

32:11.806 --> 32:13.516
Coming.

32:13.558 --> 32:16.269
Is there a list you want me
to crack on with for now?

32:16.311 --> 32:17.937
-I have to...
-Stop it!

32:17.979 --> 32:19.731
...help serve.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.900
You and Lloyd, just pulling
stuff for the beach picnic.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.276
Cool, okay.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.778
What was the worst
dinner you had?

32:24.819 --> 32:26.279
So, I wouldn't say the worst,

32:26.321 --> 32:28.365
but the one that
was the wildest...

32:28.406 --> 32:29.657
Johnny Damon.

32:29.699 --> 32:32.827
Oh, gettin' a little frisky.

32:32.869 --> 32:34.621
Salut, amor...

32:34.662 --> 32:36.539
[babbles]

32:36.581 --> 32:39.668
Babe.
-[urinating]

32:39.709 --> 32:40.710
Johnny's awesome,
he's a great dude.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.545
Yeah.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.589
When he starts drinking, like
them old baseball players, man.

32:44.631 --> 32:45.799
Y'all ready to top that?

32:47.425 --> 32:48.635
How are they, are they happy?

32:48.677 --> 32:50.970
Yeah, truffle tuna sashimi.

32:51.012 --> 32:54.557
Truffle and balsamic
with arugula and popcorn.

32:54.599 --> 32:56.434
Ready?

32:56.476 --> 32:59.437
That's your first plate, so you
wanna put that down first, yeah.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.691
Tonight you have a truffle
and balsamic tuna sashimi.

33:02.732 --> 33:04.359
-Thank you.
-Oh, there's popcorn on this.

33:07.737 --> 33:08.947
That's good, with the popcorn.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.991
That's a situation.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.284
-Okay.
-Ooh!

33:13.326 --> 33:14.661
Oh!

33:14.703 --> 33:16.538
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry.

33:16.579 --> 33:19.457
Like a disaster,
it's like what!

33:19.499 --> 33:21.209
Where's a dry tea towel?

33:24.546 --> 33:26.923
Eight chairs,
two tables, that umbrella.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.842
Ugh, I just hit my
head so ----ing hard.

33:28.883 --> 33:29.926
Oh, no!

33:29.968 --> 33:32.345
You need a drink, Captain Sandy.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.222
If I drink, let's just
say I don't know

33:34.264 --> 33:35.390
if we'd get back to the dock.

33:39.978 --> 33:42.522
I just dropped a drink on the
table in front of Captain Sandy.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.898
Is Sandy having fun out there?

33:43.940 --> 33:45.734
She always has
good stories to tell.

33:45.775 --> 33:47.235
-One brolly.
-Yeah.

33:47.277 --> 33:49.738
Chicken Milanese,
sautéed spinach,

33:49.779 --> 33:53.533
grilled baby zucchini, micro
greens with citrus vinaigrette.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.410
-Behind.
-There you go.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.287
So, for your main course
tonight

33:57.328 --> 33:59.372
you have chicken Milanese
with micro greens

33:59.414 --> 34:02.959
with a citrus dressing,
and roasted tomato gnocchi.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.502
Looks beautiful, thank you.

34:04.544 --> 34:05.628
Okay.

34:14.596 --> 34:15.930
Yeah.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.599
Like, did you say you
would like some lemon?

34:17.640 --> 34:19.476
And I wanna know if the micro
greens are, like,

34:19.517 --> 34:23.480
beet-related, because I taste
all kinds of beets up in here.

34:23.521 --> 34:25.690
I tasted some of the beets.
I hate beets.

34:27.984 --> 34:30.445
Yeah, I was, like,
I can't stand beets.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.864
Mat, can you come up?
She's asked questions.

34:35.742 --> 34:36.743
This is, like, no.

34:36.785 --> 34:37.952
I'm like...

34:37.994 --> 34:38.953
Mathew's coming.

34:38.995 --> 34:39.954
They are, I know they are.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.331
Are there beets?

34:41.373 --> 34:42.707
-Hi, Brother Mat.
-No.

34:42.749 --> 34:43.750
-The micro greens.
-They're not beets?

34:43.792 --> 34:44.751
No.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.378
In the beet family?

34:46.419 --> 34:47.379
It's called, like,
blood something micros.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.963
Oh.

34:49.005 --> 34:50.465
-Does it taste like beets?
-Yeah, it reminded me of beets.

34:50.507 --> 34:51.716
Can I do a
different plate for you?

34:51.758 --> 34:52.717
-I'm good.
-Sorry about that.

34:52.759 --> 34:53.968
Mm.

34:58.848 --> 34:59.974
They don't have beets in
it, did they?

35:01.476 --> 35:02.811
Oh [bleep].

35:05.563 --> 35:06.981
I ----ed up.

35:07.023 --> 35:08.525
Is she allergic?

35:08.566 --> 35:10.652
I've basically
lied unintentionally.

35:12.696 --> 35:13.988
...so that's the
most important thing.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.365
Right, right.

35:15.407 --> 35:16.449
Are you mad at me?

35:16.491 --> 35:17.450
No, I'm not mad.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.702
Oh ----ing hell.

35:18.743 --> 35:21.496
[bleep]
[bleep] yeah, that sucks.

35:21.538 --> 35:22.539
I have made it through
this whole dinner.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.623
Hey!

35:24.666 --> 35:25.959
Okay, well, that was the list.

35:26.001 --> 35:27.752
Anyway, thank you, thank you.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.379
Thank you so much for
joining us tonight.

35:29.421 --> 35:30.714
-We really appreciate it.
-That was beautiful.

35:30.755 --> 35:31.715
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

35:31.756 --> 35:32.924
Yes.

35:32.966 --> 35:33.967
Have we booked a
place yet in Split?

35:34.009 --> 35:34.968
We're gonna do it tonight.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.052
The last one I sent through.

35:36.094 --> 35:37.345
Damn.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.889
Yes, let's book this.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.641
Nice work, Mathew.
Thank you.

35:41.683 --> 35:43.393
The beet greens.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.061
Were they upset?

35:45.103 --> 35:46.479
-No.
-No.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.064
I loved it.
It was delicious.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.649
Yeah, yeah.

35:49.691 --> 35:51.735
-All right, thank you.
-Thanks, nice work.

35:53.403 --> 35:54.821
I just wanna make
sure that Mathew knows

35:54.863 --> 35:56.698
that I'm happy with
his performance.

35:56.740 --> 35:59.451
No matter what, how great
it is on every other area,

35:59.492 --> 36:01.870
he always goes to
that criticism place.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.747
I just wanna make sure
he stays focused.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.749
Eh.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.125
We're nearly there.

36:07.167 --> 36:09.169
Do you want me
to ask about food?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.838
Tell them I'm sleeping.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.799
All righty, it's all you.

36:14.841 --> 36:16.843
-Good night, Mathew.
-Sweet dreams.

36:16.885 --> 36:19.137
Sweet dreams, get ready for
the beach picnic tomorrow.

36:26.519 --> 36:27.687
What else, what else?

36:27.729 --> 36:29.397
There's more trash.

36:29.439 --> 36:31.691
I've done galley, upper pantry,
and lower pantry.

36:31.733 --> 36:32.692
Everything's out for the picnic.

36:32.734 --> 36:34.069
Okay.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.654
I know I took a lot of
the pressure off Malia,

36:36.696 --> 36:39.908
and I feel Malia's
appreciating my efforts on deck.

36:39.949 --> 36:43.912
I just respect and
appreciate her as a bosun,

36:43.953 --> 36:46.456
as a workmate,
and as a friend.

36:46.498 --> 36:48.541
Sorry for the extra work.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.627
Katie, let me get a
Grey Goose on the rocks.

36:50.669 --> 36:53.963
I'll take a double tequila,
orange slice, lots of ice.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.048
-Another one?
-Same.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.549
Copy that.

36:56.591 --> 36:57.676
The same drink, just put
a slice of orange in it.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.552
Perfect.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.513
Mm, I'm gonna be up until about
4:00 a.m. again, aren't I?

37:03.098 --> 37:04.849
Oh, my God.

37:04.891 --> 37:08.853
You... I like the idea of mint,
but do I want mint in that?

37:08.895 --> 37:10.063
No.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.773
I wanted... yes, with...

37:11.815 --> 37:13.650
You ain't got nothing
but options.

37:13.692 --> 37:15.568
He was hot back in them days.

37:15.610 --> 37:18.154
I feel so bad about... that
they didn't look happy at all.

37:18.196 --> 37:19.739
Well, what are we...

37:19.781 --> 37:20.990
there's nothing you can
do about it, Mat.

37:21.032 --> 37:22.659
I can complain to you.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.078
I'm, like, working
19-hour days,

37:25.120 --> 37:27.122
and I'm gonna tell you,
it doesn't matter.

37:27.163 --> 37:28.540
Hello.

37:28.581 --> 37:29.749
Ms. Katie, what you
doing in there?

37:29.791 --> 37:31.626
-I'm cleaning.
-You cleaning?

37:31.668 --> 37:32.627
Cleaning up dinner.

37:32.669 --> 37:33.920
Still?

37:33.962 --> 37:35.130
I'm gonna do
a Red Bull and vodka.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.172
-Okay.
-I'll take the same.

37:43.221 --> 37:44.931
-Thanks, Katie.
-You're welcome.

37:44.973 --> 37:46.224
Hey, time out...

37:46.266 --> 37:48.143
anybody else hungry,
a little snack?

37:48.184 --> 37:49.978
You got them warm cookies
back there, Katie?

37:50.020 --> 37:52.605
-I don't think so.
-Ooh.

37:52.647 --> 37:53.898
I think Mat's gone to bed.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.859
Whatever you have
to bring out for us.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.027
Yeah, sure.

38:04.743 --> 38:06.202
The wheels are falling
off the wagon

38:06.244 --> 38:07.954
really quickly at this point.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.956
If I can get outta here.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.836
We've got the last full
day of charter tomorrow.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.130
I'm already so exhausted.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.965
the whole crew's
exhausted as well.

38:19.007 --> 38:20.091
Thanks, Katie.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.551
Two stews?

38:28.224 --> 38:29.601
Coming up...

38:29.642 --> 38:30.852
Oh [bleep].

38:33.605 --> 38:34.564
...repeating in my head.

38:34.606 --> 38:35.690
It's overwhelming.

38:37.859 --> 38:38.902
Yeah.

38:47.118 --> 38:48.620
[snoring]

38:56.294 --> 38:57.754
I'm so over it.

39:11.309 --> 39:13.645
Would you like anything,
juice, water?

39:13.687 --> 39:15.063
Of course, I'll bring it
out for you guys.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.941
Woo, last day feels!

39:17.982 --> 39:20.610
All right, Lloyd or Mzi,
you know what's coming.

39:20.652 --> 39:21.736
We're setting
the beach picnic up.

39:21.778 --> 39:23.363
Go time.

39:23.405 --> 39:26.074
The beach picnic, so the deck
crew are gonna go over at 11:00,

39:26.116 --> 39:27.992
see how far it is,
so then we can make a plan.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.285
I hate my life.

39:29.327 --> 39:31.746
It's last day,
come on, come on.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.207
Okay, good?

39:34.249 --> 39:35.208
No.

39:35.250 --> 39:36.418
I know, but yeah.

39:36.459 --> 39:38.294
-Yeah, I'll fake it.
-Okay.

39:38.336 --> 39:41.256
First of all, I'm still upset
about the dinner last night.

39:41.297 --> 39:43.341
I haven't fully planned
what's on my menu.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.051
It sucks.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.681
A coffee and some toast.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.266
-Coffee and toast.
-Yeah.

39:51.307 --> 39:52.767
Grab my sunglasses?

39:52.809 --> 39:54.310
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

39:54.352 --> 39:56.187
How's this morning?

39:56.229 --> 39:57.439
Good, it was good.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.440
We were waiting for
you to get up.

39:58.481 --> 39:59.858
Girl needs some sleep, you know.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.776
-You sleep when you die.
-Here you go.

40:01.818 --> 40:04.112
Have anyone been taking,
like, breakfast orders?

40:04.154 --> 40:05.947
Yeah.

40:05.989 --> 40:09.409
I'd love avocado toast
with two eggs over-medium.

40:09.451 --> 40:10.952
Can I get an
omelette

40:10.994 --> 40:12.662
with shrimp, onion,
mushroom, and spinach?

40:12.704 --> 40:14.956
-Double what she got.
-Okay, cool, so two of them.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.959
Okay, I want an
egg white, scrambled,

40:18.001 --> 40:21.129
shrimp, bacon, peppers,
and avocado.

40:21.171 --> 40:22.339
Katie, I have an idea for you.

40:22.380 --> 40:25.050
-Can we eat up here?
-If you want to.

40:30.138 --> 40:31.806
One, two, three, four, five.

40:31.848 --> 40:33.391
Okay.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.018
Egg whites, scrambled, with
shrimp, bacon, peppers...

40:35.060 --> 40:38.688
oh, what a difficult
day it's gonna be.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.026
I know she down there...

40:45.236 --> 40:48.698
Egg whites with shrimp,
bacon, peppers...

40:48.740 --> 40:50.075
[bleep] me.

40:50.116 --> 40:51.451
Jesus Christ.

40:51.493 --> 40:52.994
Peppers.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.496
-Butter, if you need it.
-Can we do that after?

40:54.537 --> 40:57.040
I'm really sorry.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.083
[bleep]

41:12.889 --> 41:15.016
I'm so glad I just discovered
they had St. Germaine.

41:15.058 --> 41:17.018
Because it might have been
ugly these last three days.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.770
My goodness!

41:21.398 --> 41:23.066
Oh, my goodness.

41:23.108 --> 41:24.859
I don't know what
the [bleep] could be the...

41:24.901 --> 41:26.236
like, the egg.

41:28.363 --> 41:30.073
Sh--.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.204
White and green
onions, cheddar.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.331
Shrimp, spinach,
mushroom, onion.

41:42.043 --> 41:44.170
Oh, you gotta be ----ing
kidding me.

41:44.212 --> 41:45.880
This one time,
I was in my twenties,

41:45.922 --> 41:48.216
and I had the worst breakfast
service of my life.

41:48.258 --> 41:53.013
I cracked about 40 yolks
as I was plating them.

41:53.054 --> 41:56.016
I made a hollandaise sauce
and it broke three times.

41:56.057 --> 41:57.976
And it really sticks with me,

41:58.018 --> 42:00.061
because when I'm spiraling,
I mean, that's what happens.

42:00.103 --> 42:01.896
----ing spatula.

42:01.938 --> 42:04.858
This is, like, the worst
start to my ----ing day.

42:04.899 --> 42:06.901
I just had to move the whole
table upstairs, so it's like...

42:06.943 --> 42:08.778
I've broken like
----ing 10 yolks.

42:08.820 --> 42:10.780
If I wasn't
checked out yesterday,

42:10.822 --> 42:12.407
I reckon these eggs would
put me over the edge.

42:12.449 --> 42:13.450
Shh, okay, don't, don't, don't.

42:13.491 --> 42:14.784
We've got this, okay?

42:14.826 --> 42:15.785
Last day.

42:15.827 --> 42:16.828
I'm gonna cry.

42:16.870 --> 42:18.204
No, you're not.

42:18.246 --> 42:19.831
What are these, sorry?

42:19.873 --> 42:21.249
They should be over-medium,
but they're not.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.917
That's fine.
Do you wanna take those two up?

42:22.959 --> 42:23.960
Yeah.

42:24.002 --> 42:25.253
They're ----ed.

42:25.295 --> 42:26.254
-Don't worry.
-And I just broke...

42:26.296 --> 42:28.089
Okay, it's fine.

42:28.131 --> 42:30.133
I can't cook for [bleep] but
I can [bleep] cook an egg.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.343
I've just cracked another.

42:31.384 --> 42:32.886
He needs to figure it out,

42:32.927 --> 42:34.846
and we just need to,
like, survive this day.

42:34.888 --> 42:37.265
Okay, we've got two
of the avo toasts

42:37.307 --> 42:38.933
with the eggs over-medium.

42:38.975 --> 42:40.477
Can I just serve one egg
on each, or no?

42:40.518 --> 42:42.270
No, because you gave two
for the last one.

42:42.312 --> 42:44.356
-Oh, I see.
-Oh.

42:44.397 --> 42:46.608
I hate my life right now.

42:46.649 --> 42:48.526
-You stressed out this morning?
-No.

42:48.568 --> 42:50.820
Sorry, this is actually the
one with bacon as well.

42:50.862 --> 42:52.238
So, this one....

42:52.280 --> 42:55.033
-And it has cheese.
-There you go, yeah.

42:55.075 --> 42:56.117
-Thank you.
-You're fine, okay?

42:56.159 --> 42:57.202
We got this.

42:57.243 --> 42:59.454
-This is...
-Like, smashed.

42:59.496 --> 43:01.623
You could have a whole Waffle
House situation going on.

43:01.664 --> 43:04.292
Can we get a couple
toasted bagels from...

43:04.334 --> 43:08.129
-Bagels, sure.
-Yeah, to make this situation.

43:08.171 --> 43:09.255
-Hell no.
-It's like, I don't love that.

43:16.554 --> 43:17.597
...repeating in my head.

43:17.639 --> 43:18.973
It's overwhelming.

43:19.015 --> 43:19.974
Damn.

43:20.016 --> 43:22.310
Yeah, Christmas.

43:22.352 --> 43:24.854
Can you do me a favor?

43:29.192 --> 43:31.611
Next, on the season finale
of "Below Deck Med"...

43:31.653 --> 43:32.862
I can't believe it's the end.

43:32.904 --> 43:34.030
Hello?

43:34.072 --> 43:35.323
I'd say it's not the end yet.

43:35.365 --> 43:37.200
-Hello?
-Somebody?

43:37.242 --> 43:39.285
Anybody?

43:39.327 --> 43:40.370
My God.

43:40.412 --> 43:41.996
Two stews...
I ----ed up.

43:42.038 --> 43:43.498
I'm not perfect.

43:43.540 --> 43:44.874
Now I've gotta run around
like a crazy bitch

43:44.916 --> 43:46.501
with no fuel in the tank.

43:46.543 --> 43:48.503
Oh, you [bleep].

43:48.545 --> 43:50.171
I ----ing hate this kitchen.

43:50.213 --> 43:52.048
We have to be ready to
go in, like, 10 minutes.

43:52.090 --> 43:53.133
I'm gonna lose it.

43:53.174 --> 43:55.301
I hate my life.

43:55.343 --> 43:56.344
It's a perfect place
for a picnic...

43:56.386 --> 43:57.512
I want some food.

43:57.554 --> 43:58.513
I want a crab cake.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.306
or an execution.

44:00.348 --> 44:01.516
<i>We're dragging anchor,</i>
<i>so we gotta hurry up.</i>

44:01.558 --> 44:03.351
Let's go, let's go.

44:03.393 --> 44:04.686
Our boat's gonna keep drifting
in the shallow water.

44:04.728 --> 44:07.188
I have to move the boat.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.231
Everything went backwards.

44:08.273 --> 44:09.566
Ugh!

44:09.607 --> 44:10.608
Stop.

44:13.945 --> 44:15.071
Hello.
