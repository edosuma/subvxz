00:02.335 --> 00:04.963
Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn.

00:05.038 --> 00:06.572
You Bill Vaughn's kid?

00:06.573 --> 00:07.840
Yeah.
He was my father.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.241
He was a good man.

00:09.242 --> 00:10.909
Thank you.

00:10.910 --> 00:14.539
The passenger is...

00:16.149 --> 00:18.649
your sister.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.353
According to Rambaldi's
manuscript,

00:21.354 --> 00:23.589
The Hourglass will only
reveal the location

00:23.590 --> 00:26.025
of The Passenger to one man.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.026
Her father.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.193
Sloane.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.129
And he's going to be dead
in six hours.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.331
Jack, I want you
to meet Marlon Bell.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.994
He runs legal policy at Justice.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.697
I was telling the director how
pleased I am you caught Sloane.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.639
And if you don't mind
my saying so,

00:40.640 --> 00:43.905
looking forward to seeing
the son of a bitch die.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.063 --> 01:10.663
I orchestrated this because
and only because I need you.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.576
What's going on? Your message
said it was important.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.811
You were right.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.312
About what?

01:21.347 --> 01:24.145
Lauren's the mole.
She works for The Covenant.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.455
This was supposed to be over.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.390
With Sloane executed,
we reached a dead end

01:31.391 --> 01:33.625
in our pursuit of The Passenger.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.594
Lauren is too valuable an asset.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.095
We can feed disinformation
to The Covenant.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.032
Keep them from impeding Sydney
and Jack's investigation.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.035
As soon as The Passenger
is located,

01:43.036 --> 01:44.870
Lauren will be taken
into custody.

01:44.871 --> 01:47.306
Meanwhile, Weiss will
maintain surveillance.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.141
I'm sorry.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.053
I wasn't sure I should come.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.387
I appreciate you
putting aside your anger.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.290
Sydney, you were right.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.329
I did find evidence that
Sloane was assisting The Trust

02:10.395 --> 02:11.897
in their pursuit of Rambaldi.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.166
Why are you telling me this now?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.435
Sloane's dead.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.064
Actually, that's why
I called you here.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.639
Sydney.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.850
I was about to give
Director Bell

02:31.851 --> 02:33.519
the evidence to clear Sloane

02:33.520 --> 02:36.648
when I realized he was
a member of The Trust.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.424
I was unclear as to
what their agenda was,

02:39.425 --> 02:42.155
but I did know executing
Sloane was part of it.

02:42.228 --> 02:47.097
The only sure way to save his
life was to allow him to die.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.001
Your father was kind enough to
offer me a final glass of wine.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.766
It was laced
with a tetrodotoxin compound.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.536
It counteracted
the lethal injection

02:56.609 --> 02:59.134
by reducing my cardiac
and respiratory functions.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.879
Mimicking death?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.048
That's right.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.813
Whatever grief my apparent death
might have caused you,

03:05.885 --> 03:07.853
I wish I could have
spared you the pain.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.821
When I heard you were dead,
any grief

03:09.822 --> 03:13.258
was over the possibility
of never knowing my sister.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.326
I did not grieve for you.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.063
I see.

03:19.566 --> 03:25.732
Well, in the interest
of finding your sister,

03:25.805 --> 03:28.305
may I have The Hourglass?

03:35.248 --> 03:38.376
I know you've been withholding
something from the CIA.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.951
Even from The Trust.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.717
Why is The Passenger important?

03:44.791 --> 03:47.291
What is your daughter's
real value?

03:49.529 --> 03:52.396
While I was searching for her,
I made a discovery.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.559
I came across
an old Rambaldi text.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.695
In it, Rambaldi prophesied
that there would be a person,

03:58.771 --> 04:00.973
a passenger,
who would be capable

04:00.974 --> 04:03.602
of serving as
a direct conduit to him.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.476
The text contained
a formula for an elixir.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.777
So I followed
the instructions exactly.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.318
According to Rambaldi,
this elixir, if injected,

04:13.319 --> 04:16.015
would bring about an altered
state of consciousness,

04:16.089 --> 04:20.753
allowing The Passenger
to channel a message.

04:20.827 --> 04:28.199
This message is rumored to be
the key to Rambaldi's endgame.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.336
I sampled the elixir myself.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.199
Hoping to make myself
the conduit.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.244
It didn't work.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.745
It's meant only for her.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.181
If The Covenant finds her...

04:47.620 --> 04:50.783
...they will expose her
to the elixir in massive doses.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.486
It will lay waste to her psyche.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.060
More likely, it will kill her.

04:58.698 --> 05:03.135
All I want to do
is to protect my child.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.271
How do we find her?

05:07.473 --> 05:09.973
We use this.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.134
I thought you were
working from home.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.635
I just came past
to pick up these files.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.637
I've been thinking
about that trip to Fiji.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.679
Getting one of those bungalows
perched on the ocean.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.581
Well, what about next month?

05:49.582 --> 05:50.882
Be serious.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.341
I am. We've been talking about
getting away for over a year.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.218
And visiting your mom
in Virginia doesn't count.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.290
I love you.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.332
Hello?

06:07.333 --> 06:09.101
- Agent Vaughn?
- Yeah. Who's this?

06:09.102 --> 06:11.470
Thomas Brill.
Jack Bristow introduced us.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.238
Right.
What can I do for you?

06:13.239 --> 06:16.140
There are some things you need
to know about your father.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.543
Meet me
at the Transatlantic Building.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.878
By the freight elevator.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.247
Okay, I'll be there.
Thanks.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.549
- Who was that?
- Just the dry cleaners.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.713
Apparently I've had a suit there
for over a month.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.055
Would you like me to pick it up?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.556
No.
You've got enough work.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.057
- I'll see you at home then.
- Okay.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.789
I told you that I worked
with your father.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.853
But I didn't tell you I was
with him on his final mission.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.801
I know how my father died.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.362
You don't have a clue.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.972
Yeah, he was working
on something.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.138
An operation that wasn't
sanctioned by the CIA.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.112
My father would never go
against the CIA.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.980
He was a follower of Rambaldi.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.183
That's impossible.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.711
He died protecting
the little girl.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.556
The followers knew
she was The Passenger.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.825
He broke her out of KGB custody.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.960
But he didn't trust
the CIA, either.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.260
So he took her where she would
be safe with other followers.

07:45.331 --> 07:48.095
The man you are describing
is not my father.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.795
Your father was the best man
I've ever known.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.237
He gave his life to make sure
that girl would be safe.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.408
If you don't stop
what's happening,

07:56.409 --> 07:59.435
his sacrifice
will be for nothing.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.795
Ah, no, no!
Damn it!

08:20.466 --> 08:21.867
You know what you've got to do.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.769
Just make sure
that they don't get to her.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.271
Why did you come to me?

08:28.341 --> 08:31.037
Because it's what he would
want me to do.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.357
You claim this is a battery
for one of Rambaldi's artifacts

08:55.434 --> 08:57.202
which can locate The Passenger.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.437
Before we risk exposure
to The Trust,

08:59.438 --> 09:02.498
we need to be 100% certain
they have this artifact.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.043
I know they have it.
I gave it to them.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.578
According to my contact,

09:06.579 --> 09:08.246
The Trust
has a cold-storage vault

09:08.247 --> 09:11.375
concealed
in the Smithsonian here.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.317
The vault is secured
by a 5-key retinal system.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.288
It's safe to assume
it corresponds

09:16.289 --> 09:17.956
with the five members.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.157
Do we know who they are?

09:19.158 --> 09:21.888
We know they're high-ranking
government officials,

09:21.961 --> 09:23.862
but we've only been able
to confirm one.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.423
Marlon Bell,
D.O.J. Division Director.

09:26.499 --> 09:30.401
I imagine a visit from a ghost
will unearth the other four.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.910
The Secretary of State
goes before committee tomorrow.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.147
He wants that brief out
by the end of the day.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.049
With all due respect,
Director Bell,

09:44.050 --> 09:46.117
even with The Patriot Act,
the legal footing's shaky.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.786
Find the precedents.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.287
- We've already gone over that.
- Find them.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.426
Sir?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.927
Sir?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.335
I've tapped
into Bell's phone line.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.430
He should have made contact
with The Trust by now.

10:06.505 --> 10:10.839
Sydney, there's something
you should know.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.606
When I first learned of Sloane's
affair with your mother...

10:17.516 --> 10:19.317
I was forced to consider
the possibility

10:19.318 --> 10:22.310
that I wasn't in fact
your biological father.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.888
- You don't even need to...
- It's not the case.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.626
I had our medical files
examined.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.127
Our relationship is clear.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.999
I wanted you to know,
during that brief time

10:34.000 --> 10:36.500
before I was reassured...

10:39.405 --> 10:42.568
...my feelings for you
never changed.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.545
Dad.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.918
He's picking up.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.056
We have a situation
that requires

10:58.057 --> 10:59.824
our immediate attention.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.559
We need to meet.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.060
Arvin Sloane is alive.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.729
Your friend Brill
managed to elude us.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.397
You, however,
were not so fortunate.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.907
We've known for a while

11:15.908 --> 11:19.435
your father was a follower
of Rambaldi.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.012
And we were hoping
they'd contact you.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.345
But there are three things
you should understand.

11:25.418 --> 11:29.445
The first involves this item
I hold in my hand.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.659
It's capable of delivering
up to 500,000 volts.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.329
Not enough to kill you.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.163
Just enough to let you
wish it would.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.935
Second, I believe
Mr. Brill disclosed

11:43.936 --> 11:46.104
the location of The Passenger,

11:46.105 --> 11:49.131
which means I won't stop
until you tell me.

11:50.342 --> 11:53.072
And third, Mr. Vaughn,

11:53.145 --> 11:55.705
is that I'm going to enjoy this
more than I should.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.281
Aah!

12:28.114 --> 12:30.014
Lauren Reed evaded
our surveillance

12:30.015 --> 12:33.644
sometime between 2: 10
and 2:47 P.M.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.121
Law enforcement officials
at every level

12:36.122 --> 12:37.589
have been put on alert.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.758
We've also lost contact
with Agent Vaughn.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.060
He's not responding
to his calls.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.362
We believe he may have
been compromised.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.731
Agent Weiss will assemble
a search team.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.232
Be ready to move
as soon as we get a lead.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.204
Remember, your glasses
need a five-second lock

12:53.205 --> 12:55.765
on each person
for the scan to register.

12:55.841 --> 12:58.341
Wish me luck.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.579
Sydney, Sloane's
on his way to the meeting

13:01.580 --> 13:03.615
of The Trust
to obtain the retinal scans.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.517
Make sure you get to the vault,
and we'll have the codes.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.019
Copy that.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.520
I'm in position.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.724
Ah.
Hello, Miss Gerard?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.196
I'm Phillip Terrance.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.297
We spoke earlier.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.798
Call me Shannon.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.336
Amazing, isn't it?

13:25.337 --> 13:26.805
36 feet.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.274
Longest neck
of any known dinosaur.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.472
Not a lot of people know
that mamenchisaurus actually had

13:32.545 --> 13:33.545
an extra brain.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.813
In its spinal cord.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.476
To control its hind legs
and tail.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.122
You said you're writing
a research paper

13:44.123 --> 13:45.557
on theropod dinosaurs?

13:45.558 --> 13:48.823
Yeah, specifically
theropods and archaeopteryx

13:48.894 --> 13:50.628
and the similarities.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.826
Oh, so you think birds are
descended from dinosaurs?

13:53.899 --> 13:56.527
Not that there's
conclusive proof.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.770
It drives me crazy
when orthodox types

13:58.771 --> 14:01.365
refuse to even examine
the evidence.

14:01.807 --> 14:05.106
That thinking got Giordano Bruno
burned at the stake.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.312
You know, we just received
the Hainan fossil from China.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.543
I have to admit
I was hoping to see it.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.088
Well, no,
it's still in analysis.

14:17.089 --> 14:20.115
That area is restricted
to visitors.

14:24.897 --> 14:29.960
But, you know,
I could make an exception.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.863
I must say, I'm impressed.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.772
Of course, it's on
the lowest setting.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.943
But I'm through
showing restraint.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.054
I'll ask you again.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.817
Where is The Passenger?

14:56.028 --> 14:58.528
Holding that thing.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.933
You almost look like
you've reached puberty.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.504
Aah!

15:11.477 --> 15:12.777
You have great timing.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.542
We only have it on loan
from China till Wednesday.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.448
Have you already done
the C.T. Scan?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.949
Last week.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.687
I would love
to take a look at it.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.156
Well, you know,
they're in radiology.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.125
I'll go get 'em.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.626
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.699
I'm headed to the vault.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.833
Copy that.

15:35.834 --> 15:36.968
We're on schedule.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.469
You can proceed.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.176
Greetings from the dead,
gentlemen.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.347
Standing by to receive.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.348
Copy that.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.849
We're retrieving
the retinal scans now.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.619
I thought we had an agreement.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.714
My Rambaldi artifacts
and expertise

15:57.790 --> 15:59.691
in exchange for my freedom.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.826
Of course, once I served
my purpose,

16:01.827 --> 16:03.428
you saw fit to dispose of me.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.193
First scan complete.
Move on.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.757
The cover story that you
planned on releasing.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.497
Arvin Sloane killed
in a boating accident

16:12.571 --> 16:14.706
off the coast of Saint Lucia.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.972
Tragic, with a slight taint
of overly extravagant lifestyle.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.844
Complete.
Move on.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.679
Actually, I would have thought

16:21.680 --> 16:25.480
that an automobile accident
would be more to your taste.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.019
Clearly, I underestimated
your creativity.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.520
Got a lock.
Hold it just two more seconds.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.290
I should have been
thinking more clearly.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.858
We got it.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.693
Gentlemen, the facts.

16:35.694 --> 16:38.194
Sydney, I'm sending
the first three now.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.265
Uplink complete.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.766
I'm moving to authorize.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.001
I am afraid it will
never see the light of day.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.508
And let me tell you why.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.743
We've got it.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.577
I don't think the most
clandestine committee

16:54.646 --> 16:55.747
in the U.S. Government

16:55.748 --> 16:58.248
would want such sordid details
made public,

16:58.250 --> 17:01.515
which is why I'm going to
leave this room unharmed.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.588
If I get so much
as a traffic ticket,

17:03.589 --> 17:06.558
the next time you hear
this information will be on CNN.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.925
That's enough.

17:08.926 --> 17:12.363
I will not be blackmailed
by a petty criminal.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.025
We didn't get it.
Don't let him leave.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.101
I forgot to tell you something.

17:17.102 --> 17:22.005
I know all about your son
and his unseemly predilections.

17:22.074 --> 17:25.669
Try thinking of it
as mutually assured destruction.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.243
We've got it.
Get out.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.448
Thank you for your time, gents.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.577
Final scan is on its way.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.340
Shannon?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.945
What are you doing?

18:00.946 --> 18:04.040
I'm sorry.
You've been so nice.

18:07.986 --> 18:09.454
I've got the package.

18:09.455 --> 18:12.049
Meet me at the rendezvous
point as scheduled.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.674
There it is.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.045
What is it?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.546
It looks like brainwaves.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.518
We found her.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.364
Don't touch me.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.533
Michael, please.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.992
Sark's going to give you
the Inferno Protocol.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.671
You can't survive.

19:00.672 --> 19:03.172
Not after everything
you've been through.

19:03.675 --> 19:06.175
What do you care?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.112
Not everything was a lie.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.650
Get him down
and put him on the cot.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.486
You can't do this procedure now.
He needs time to recover.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.828
Why this sudden concern
for your husband's well-being?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.354
If he dies, he'll take
the information with him.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.127
Whatever feelings you have
for him don't concern me.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.269
Please listen.

19:31.270 --> 19:35.001
Please escort Miss Reed
out of here.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.676
Now, where were we?

19:44.416 --> 19:47.283
I don't understand. How can
a brain scan help us find her?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.082
Each individual has a signature
brain-wave pattern

19:50.155 --> 19:51.956
as unique as a fingerprint.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.358
So to exploit this,
the D.O.D.'s developed

19:54.359 --> 19:56.727
an experimental
satellite network

19:56.728 --> 19:59.163
capable of remote
encephalography.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.365
- Reading brainwaves from orbit.
- Right.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.801
I just spoke with my contact
at D.O.D.

20:03.802 --> 20:07.397
He uplinked the EEG readings to
the Defense Satellite Network.

20:07.472 --> 20:08.606
We have a location.

20:08.607 --> 20:09.740
Where is she?

20:09.741 --> 20:10.541
Chechnya.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.843
A labor camp
for female prisoners

20:12.844 --> 20:14.478
on the outskirts of Kamyshev.

20:14.479 --> 20:17.915
My contact was able to check
the prison's central database.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.284
He found her under the alias
Talia Kozlov.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.919
She's being held in sector C.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.120
She's incarcerated.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.456
We've been operating
under the assumption

20:25.457 --> 20:27.692
that she's an innocent
in need of rescue.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.393
Given that she's being detained,

20:29.394 --> 20:32.761
I think those assumptions
need to be reexamined.

20:32.831 --> 20:37.325
She's my daughter,
and we're going to find her.

20:39.638 --> 20:43.597
Considering this
new information,

20:43.675 --> 20:45.943
you may need to adjust
your expectations

20:45.944 --> 20:48.444
regarding your sister as well.

20:48.947 --> 20:53.407
After mom died,
I used to have these daydreams.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.548
I would imagine her
leading my Girl Scout troop

20:56.622 --> 21:00.114
or taking me shopping
for new school clothes.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.425
I thought if only she'd lived,

21:01.426 --> 21:03.926
she would have been
my best friend.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.130
When I learned the truth
about her

21:06.131 --> 21:10.227
and saw Irina
for who she really was...

21:11.303 --> 21:13.803
...I was devastated.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.203
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.185
What's going on?

21:28.186 --> 21:29.854
It's over.

21:29.855 --> 21:33.291
The Protocol worked.
Somehow you survived.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.327
- Michael, listen to me.
- Did I tell him?

21:36.328 --> 21:38.596
You told Sark everything.
He'll be back any second.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.097
You have to get out of here.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.434
Why are you doing this?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.839
For me, our marriage was real.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.340
The only real thing in my life.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.943
Go.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.318
Hey!

23:54.099 --> 23:56.599
Hey, are you okay?

23:56.701 --> 23:58.102
I need to get to a phone.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.438
Here. Use mine.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.939
Thanks.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.010
Dispatch.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.511
This is Officer 2300708.

24:08.513 --> 24:11.346
Patch me through
to Director Dixon immediately.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.952
Vaughn, where are you?

24:14.953 --> 24:17.421
The Covenant knows
the location of The Passenger.

24:17.422 --> 24:19.690
Sark's moving on the lead.

24:19.691 --> 24:22.251
How did they acquire the intel?

24:22.327 --> 24:23.961
From me.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.692
We'll put together a tactical
team and beat them to it.

24:26.765 --> 24:29.265
Where is The Passenger now?

24:36.908 --> 24:37.908
You cut out.

24:37.909 --> 24:40.409
Bad reception.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.481
Vaughn, what's wrong?

24:48.053 --> 24:50.553
Is Sydney back from Hong Kong?

25:37.102 --> 25:39.602
Don't move!

25:39.671 --> 25:41.605
Get on the ground.

25:41.606 --> 25:44.106
On the ground.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.476
You're smarter than I thought.

27:17.769 --> 27:22.172
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I'm your sister.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.701
I know that sounds crazy.

27:26.311 --> 27:30.771
I'm sorry it took me so long
to find you, but I'm here now,

27:30.849 --> 27:33.750
and I am going
to get you out of here.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.650
You will be safe now.
I promise you.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.025
By the way, I almost forgot.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.826
My name is Sydney.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.095
This was taken
from the surveillance camera

27:45.096 --> 27:47.596
at the Garland Industrial Plant.

27:48.633 --> 27:51.431
I was able to enhance
the footage.

27:53.938 --> 27:55.939
This was taken
from the surveillance feed

27:55.940 --> 27:58.440
from the rear of the building.

27:59.277 --> 28:02.110
Get the listing for every
business, ATM, traffic light

28:02.180 --> 28:03.681
within a five-mile radius.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.949
Have them pull
their surveillance feeds.

28:05.950 --> 28:09.283
I want to know where they went
after they left the scene.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.300
We're about to embark
onto a procedure

28:23.301 --> 28:27.761
the CIA was more than willing
to use on me.

28:29.007 --> 28:32.943
You have to admit
the reversal is a tad ironic.

28:33.912 --> 28:37.643
This time, my friend,
it's for real.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.670
You met with a man.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.171
Who was he?

29:02.373 --> 29:04.873
Brill.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.476
He knew my father.

29:08.146 --> 29:11.081
And did Brill tell you
where The Passenger is?

29:11.950 --> 29:14.450
He told me.

29:14.853 --> 29:17.353
Where is she?

29:18.556 --> 29:21.056
No.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.160
I'll ask you again.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.289
Where is The Passenger?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.934
Increase the dosage.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.941
What is it?

29:40.011 --> 29:42.346
Really?

29:42.347 --> 29:45.714
And to who do I owe my thanks?

29:46.951 --> 29:48.519
We're done here.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.020
We have her location.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.322
What about him?

29:52.323 --> 29:54.823
Kill him.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.418
Who are you?

30:54.419 --> 30:56.919
Later.

31:11.736 --> 31:14.236
Aah!

31:18.209 --> 31:20.709
Aah!

31:27.252 --> 31:29.052
Come on.
Come on.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.954
We got to get to the tunnel.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.455
Come on.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.059
Come on.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.396
We got the surveillance footage

31:39.397 --> 31:41.765
from 74 cameras
around the dock yards.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.201
There's some major freakazoid
stuff going on.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.702
Not a place you want to
go to after hours.

31:46.704 --> 31:49.204
Unless you're into
that sort of thing.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.075
Anyway, I was able to
piece together the feeds.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.010
What did you find?

31:53.011 --> 31:55.912
After they abducted Vaughn, they
were spotted two minutes later

31:55.980 --> 31:58.480
on 5th and Grand.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.909
A rooftop camera caught them
turning onto Frontage Road.

32:02.987 --> 32:06.184
- Marshall, where are they now?
- I'm getting to that.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.259
Final destination.
4384 Alfano Street.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.696
- Abandoned packaging warehouse.
- Thank you.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.197
Yes.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.645
Vaughn!

32:28.646 --> 32:29.813
Vaughn.

32:29.814 --> 32:30.847
Come on, buddy.

32:30.848 --> 32:31.848
I'm right here.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.349
You're gonna be okay.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.887
Get a medivac down here now!

32:42.794 --> 32:43.927
Go.
I'll catch up.

32:43.928 --> 32:46.363
No, I'm not leaving you.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.465
I feel faint.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.663
Here, you just need to sit down
just for a minute.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.236
Here you go.
Here you go.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.679
Take some deep breaths.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.180
Yeah.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.527
So who are you?

33:17.528 --> 33:19.363
You can call me Talia.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.864
I know that's not
your real name.

33:24.102 --> 33:26.269
Well, what were you doing
back there?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.898
Why were you pretending
to be catatonic?

33:29.574 --> 33:32.074
I can't tell you.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.712
You're an agent.

33:37.782 --> 33:40.282
Argentine Intelligence.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.958
What you said back there...

33:47.959 --> 33:50.459
...is true.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.495
We're sisters.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.213
How did you find me?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.583
It wasn't just me.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.286
It was your father.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.157
My father?

34:22.726 --> 34:25.226
Yeah.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.830
He's waiting for you.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.452
Nadia.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.953
My name is Nadia.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.448
When Will used to talk
about his sister Amy,

35:18.449 --> 35:21.179
he was always so exasperated.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.686
He said she was a flake.

35:26.757 --> 35:29.624
He told me I was lucky
to be an only child.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.362
But I knew he was lying.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.863
He loved her.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.934
I always wondered what they had.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.809
I have a sister.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.716
I believe you assured me

35:52.717 --> 35:56.175
you weren't going to make
the same mistake twice.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.172
I know who you are.

36:19.410 --> 36:23.870
Well, then you know
about my criminal past.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.177
You also know that I've changed.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.886
But you need to know why.

36:32.657 --> 36:35.157
I never knew I had a daughter.

36:36.327 --> 36:40.161
I didn't know until two years
ago that you even existed.

36:40.765 --> 36:44.997
When I found out,
I felt total and complete joy.

36:45.069 --> 36:48.300
I just wanted to go out
and find you immediately.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.441
But then...

36:53.511 --> 36:54.978
...it struck me.

36:54.979 --> 36:57.479
The shame.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.014
I was ashamed of the man I was.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.585
I knew I wasn't worthy of you.

37:07.758 --> 37:11.888
I wasn't worthy of your love.
I wasn't worthy of your respect.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.233
From that moment on,
I vowed to change.

37:18.369 --> 37:21.304
I didn't want to meet
my daughter face-to-face...

37:23.274 --> 37:25.774
...and have her despise me.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.784
Stay here.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.183
We want The Passenger unharmed.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.695
Move. Move!

38:09.520 --> 38:12.020
Where are they?

38:22.166 --> 38:24.666
They cannot have escaped.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.441
What is this?

38:37.415 --> 38:38.848
Sloane set us up.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.483
He betrayed us.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.984
Agents, move out!

38:49.694 --> 38:51.261
This was a Chechen safe house.

38:51.262 --> 38:54.993
It was Sloane's suggestion
we seek refuge here.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.300
Sloane was the only person
who knew where we were.

38:57.301 --> 38:59.669
He tipped The Covenant,
lured them here,

38:59.670 --> 39:02.332
giving him a chance
to escape with Nadia.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.226
Vaughn.

39:26.063 --> 39:28.563
Sydney.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.268
Are you all right?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.538
I'm fine.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.108
The Passenger.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.609
Did you find her?

39:41.045 --> 39:43.213
Yes.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.214
But she's gone.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.616
She's missing.

39:46.617 --> 39:49.117
You can't go after her.

39:49.754 --> 39:50.987
What?

39:50.988 --> 39:53.089
Your sister.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.590
You have to let her go.

39:56.594 --> 39:58.628
You're tired.
I should let you sleep.

39:58.629 --> 40:02.861
My father was killed because
he took her from the KGB.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.235
He hid her from your mother.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.736
That's why she murdered him.

40:08.005 --> 40:12.101
I met someone
who told me the prophecy.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.043
The Passenger and The Chosen One
shall battle.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.346
Neither will survive.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.347
Sydney.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.848
You can't see her again.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.708
Please.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.311
Don't do this.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.881
Please don't.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.712
I only wish
there could be another way.

41:22.379 --> 41:24.879
I'm so sorry.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.983
I'm so sorry.
