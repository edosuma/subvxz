(crowd cheering)

02:51.238 --> 02:54.685
I want a special hand for our

02:58.645 --> 03:00.690
Thank you, thank you very much.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.192
All right,
that concludes this set.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.195
But I want you to stick around,
because in the next set,

03:05.219 --> 03:09.065
we're gonna have Leather
Tuscadero and the Suedes!

03:09.089 --> 03:10.966
-(cheering)
- Okay.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.504
And the band!

03:17.131 --> 03:18.975
Us!

03:18.999 --> 03:21.745
We're-we're gonna have
the group!

03:21.769 --> 03:24.272
The-the guys who play
the instruments!

03:26.306 --> 03:29.586
We got to get a name, guys.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.322
Hey, Pots, see those two cuties
over there?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.824
Oh, yeah. One of them
crossed her eyes at me.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.493
You know what that means.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.462
Yeah, the other one's mine.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.531
- Oh, hi, Joanie.
- Oh, Rich, hi.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.999
Aren't Mom and Dad
coming tonight?

03:43.023 --> 03:44.300
Oh, yeah, they're gonna be here.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.568
They're having dinner

03:45.592 --> 03:47.270
with that friend of Dad's
and his new wife.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.439
But they said they'd be here
for the second set.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.141
Aw, darn, not the second show.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.270
I mean, that's when
all the hunks show up.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.644
Looks like another
hunkless evening.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.057
You've been annoyed
all the way over here.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.027
Now, I don't know
why Wally divorcing Corrine

04:11.051 --> 04:12.228
should bother you.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.198
Well, Corrine happens to be
my good friend.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.600
He dumped her
for a child bride.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.601
Oh, Marion, she's an adult.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.571
Oh, sure, all adults say,
"Oh, neato.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.239
"So nice to meet you, Marion.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.742
"Neato!
My first French restaurant!

04:25.766 --> 04:27.677
Oh! oh!"

04:27.701 --> 04:29.312
Marion, you're making a scene.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.247
Besides, you're exaggerating.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.350
She may have said "neato," but
her feet never left the ground.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.586
- Hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hi, Al.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.122
You look so dashing
and elegant tonight.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.157
Especially you, Mrs. C.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.093
Alfred, what would you call

04:44.117 --> 04:47.197
a 47-year-old man who marries
a 23-year-old girl?

04:47.221 --> 04:50.066
I'd call him a lucky guy.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.802
Alfred, I'm surprised at you.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.803
A cradle robber.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.672
I would call him
a cradle robber.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.607
That's not cradle robbing.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.376
She happens to be
a 23-year-old schoolteacher

05:00.400 --> 05:02.178
who's a very lovely young woman.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.681
And who goes,
"Neato, neato, neato!"

05:04.705 --> 05:06.282
She does?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.017
Wh-What-What'll you guys have?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.086
Well, I'll just have
some hot tea.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.822
Me, too, Al. Thanks.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.626
You know, you were
staring at her all evening.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.895
Lemon or milk with your tea?

05:18.919 --> 05:21.531
I was not staring,
I was just looking.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.500
Now, there is a difference
between staring and looking.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.636
Milk or lemon?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.206
Yes, you look at me;
you were staring at her.

05:30.230 --> 05:33.142
I'll bring lemon and milk.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.846
I wasn't staring,
I was just being friendly.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.508
Thank you, sweetheart.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.918
Just being friendly again, dear?

05:41.942 --> 05:45.021
Marion, I didn't even
look at her.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.724
I know, but it was the way
you didn't even look at her.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.626
Oh...

05:49.650 --> 05:51.761
Hi, Mom, Dad.
I'm glad you could make it.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.663
- Richard.
- Hello, Richard.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.165
I think.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.101
Well, how was the dinner party?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.335
- Fine.
- Oh, just dreadful.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.904
Huh?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.872
Your mother's got a headache.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.109
Your father's friends
gave it to me.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.112
Okay. Uh, I hate to rush off.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.914
(chuckles)

06:10.938 --> 06:13.283
I don't want to spoil
your evening or anything.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.911
(toots note)

06:17.144 --> 06:19.055
Poor Corrine.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.425
She was loving and loyal
to Wally for 18 years.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.927
No, they were never happy,
Marion.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.228
As a matter of fact,

06:25.252 --> 06:27.330
it was Corrine who filed
for the divorce.

06:27.354 --> 06:30.800
Are you gonna rob the cradle
when I'm over the hill, Howard?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.201
-(drumroll)
- Ladies and gentlemen,

06:32.225 --> 06:34.137

09:15.989 --> 09:18.601
those young cupcakes
are so wonderful,

09:18.625 --> 09:20.770
maybe you should just stay here

09:20.794 --> 09:22.371

09:22.395 --> 09:24.240

her, uh, her headache?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.167
She'll get over it.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.870
You know, Richard, I've been
thinking about investing

09:53.894 --> 09:56.873
in some beachfront property
down in Florida.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.875
Then when it comes time
for me to retire,

09:58.899 --> 10:01.277
your mother and I can just
move down there

10:01.301 --> 10:03.112
and live among the palm trees.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.981
Would you like that, Marion?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.016
Drink your milk, Richard.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.385
Oh, Howard, I think
that's a terrific idea!

10:09.409 --> 10:11.220
I knew you'd like it,
sweetheart.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.556
Dad, I hate to interrupt
your conversation,

10:13.580 --> 10:17.527
but, uh, I'm gonna get
while the getting's good.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.691
Dad, just better watch out
for her left.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.300
(chuckles)

10:24.324 --> 10:26.435
(clears throat)

10:26.459 --> 10:28.938
Sweetheart, I got to stop off
at Hearn's Hardware Supply

10:28.962 --> 10:30.940
and pick up a case
of sledgehammers,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.875
so I'm gonna be
a little late tonight.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.414
All right, Marion.

10:38.438 --> 10:42.151
So Wally Moss married
a 23-year-old girl.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.487
Now, what can I say, huh?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.513
I'll see you tonight.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.458
(sighs)

10:55.422 --> 10:56.732
JOANIE:
Mom?

10:56.756 --> 10:59.602
Oh, Mom, uh...

10:59.626 --> 11:02.371
will you fix
the elastic on my beret?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.006
Oh, where's my math book?

11:04.030 --> 11:05.908
I left it on the table.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.444
Oh, here's your math book, dear.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.247
Just the way you like it,
nice and cold.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.416
Mom!

11:13.440 --> 11:14.584
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.851
I'm just all turned around.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.852
Oh.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.721
- You know, you look tired.
- I do?

11:18.745 --> 11:21.524
Yeah. Maybe you should start
taking naps after breakfast

11:21.548 --> 11:22.658
like Grandma Kelp.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.060
Grandma Kelp?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.728
Mm. Well, I better go.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.264
Binky Hodges is waiting
to carry my books for me.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.298
See you, Mom.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.933
Hope he has gloves.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.768
- Joanie.
- Yeah?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.570
Am I over the hill?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.772
I'll bite. Are you?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.574
- I'm not joking.
- Oh.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.843
And what about your father?
Is he?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.445
Dad? Over the hill?

11:42.469 --> 11:43.746
Are you kidding?

11:43.770 --> 11:45.615
He still plays catch
with Richie,

11:45.639 --> 11:47.383
and he's still one of the guys.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.818
Well, Binky's waiting, Mom.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.586
I'll see you later.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.789
Yeah, well, good-bye, dear.

11:53.813 --> 11:57.126
Well, I guess Howard is
still one of the guys.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.161
I used to be one of the girls.

11:59.185 --> 12:02.531
Well, if he wants a young chick,
I can give him a young chick.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.500
I can be like Peggy Sue.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.300
Neato! Neato! Neato!

12:09.162 --> 12:12.074
Oh, he's gonna dump me
for a youngie.

12:12.098 --> 12:15.711

dump me for a youngie.</i>

12:37.023 --> 12:38.301
Oh.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.770
But you're a great guy

12:40.794 --> 12:41.871

Yeah!

12:41.895 --> 12:43.172
You're really lots of fun.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.674
OTHERS:
Yeah!

12:44.698 --> 12:47.043
Well, that's the secret of
staying young, you know, Rich.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.344
Having fun. Right, Al?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.473
Yeah. You betcha, Howie.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.149
Where's my dreamboat?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.051
Ah, there he is.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.885
Hi, there, leather cutie.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.690
Come on, Howie, let's dance.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.658
The night's young
and so are we.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.684
Yeah.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.567
Say, what do you say you and I

13:11.591 --> 13:13.336
get together after
the concert, huh?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.503
Oh, sure, Howie.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.138
I'll just tell Fabian I'm busy.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.907
Ah, the poor devil.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.009
Can't beat that
Howie charm, huh?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.043
(chuckles):
You know it.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.244
I'll catch you later.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.046
Okay.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.072
(chuckles)

13:31.444 --> 13:32.722
(Al laughs)

13:32.746 --> 13:33.856
Oh, boy.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.292
Here you g0, 911V-

13:36.316 --> 13:38.294
(chuckles) And no charge.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.363
The girls in the next booth
picked up the tab.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.932
Aw, thank them for me,
will you, Al?

13:42.956 --> 13:45.167
And tell them you'll put them
on my waiting list, huh?

13:45.191 --> 13:47.002
I may have an opening
the beginning of the year.

13:47.026 --> 13:50.406
You got it, Howie.
He's got it.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.041
(girls squealing)

13:52.065 --> 13:54.067
<i>II</i>

13:59.239 --> 14:00.582
(Snaps fingers)

14:01.608 --> 14:03.383
(Snaps fingers)

14:11.985 --> 14:13.987
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

14:16.322 --> 14:19.101
We're tearing
these girls apart, here.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.803
All right, he's yours.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.638
GIRLS:
Howie!

14:22.662 --> 14:24.206
FONZIE:
Well...

14:24.230 --> 14:26.972
I finally met my match.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.880
I bend my thumb to you.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.848
Aw, don't worry, Fonz.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.750
Don't worry,
there's plenty to go around.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.318
Yeah, I know, but, Howie...

14:36.342 --> 14:38.788
I'm sorry. Sorry.

14:38.812 --> 14:41.424
If you ever find yourself
getting tired

14:41.448 --> 14:45.094
or that you got an excess,
would you send them my way?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.429
You got it, Fonz.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.128
Oh, whoa. Oh, whoa. Oh, whoa.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.771
Ah, youth.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.012
Oh, Howard,
what are you eating?

15:03.036 --> 15:05.047
You'll spoil your dinner.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.449
Oh, don't worry about it, Mom.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.679
I'm gonna eat here.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.286
What?!

15:10.310 --> 15:12.922
I'm your wife, not your mother!

15:12.946 --> 15:14.457
I'm still gonna eat here.

15:14.481 --> 15:18.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.396
All the girls, once again,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.966
have elected my dad,
Howie Cunningham,

15:23.990 --> 15:26.802
the Biggest Hunk of the Year
award.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.828
(crowd cheering)

15:30.029 --> 15:31.906
Thank you, thank you.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.177
Oh, I've lost my husband.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.179
I've lost my husband.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.581
FONZIE:
Hey, Mrs. C.,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.749
I just came to fill my...
my thermos full of coffee.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.284
What?

15:42.308 --> 15:45.087
Mrs. C., I just came
to fill up my thermos.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.090
Uh-oh, I caught you daydreaming,
huh, Mrs. C.?

15:48.114 --> 15:51.427
Oh, Arthur, what am I gonna do?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.028
Uh, about what, Mrs. C.?

15:53.052 --> 15:55.631
About Howard running off
with a younger lady.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.657
Whoa!

16:03.696 --> 16:05.908
Hey, I-l don't think
my ears are in alignment.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.376
Did you just say that Mr. C.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.811
Is running off
with a younger lady?

16:08.835 --> 16:11.080
Not a lady, a child.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.950
I mean, he hasn't, yet,
but he is going to soon.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.319
I don't think we're on
the same wavelength here.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.021
- Oh, Arthur...
- Yeah?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.223
- Arthur, tell me something.
- Yeah.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.859
Don't all men

16:23.883 --> 16:25.427
want to have a young chick

16:25.451 --> 16:27.162
when their wives
get old and rickety?

16:27.186 --> 16:29.164
- What?
- I mean, when they get all bored

16:29.188 --> 16:31.267
with the same routine
day in and day out

16:31.291 --> 16:32.735
and day out and day in

16:32.759 --> 16:35.037
and year after year and women
get wrinkles and they get old

16:35.061 --> 16:36.338
and they don't look
good anymore, gray hair.

16:36.362 --> 16:37.439
Wait, wait, hold it. Whoa!

16:37.463 --> 16:38.674
Men always look good
and distinguished.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.075
All right, I think
that you're letting

16:40.099 --> 16:42.578
your imagination run amok
with you here.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.281
Now, in the first place,
Mrs. C., you're not old.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.116
- I'm not old?
- No.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.117
How about rickety?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.251
Hey, you're not rickety, either.

16:49.275 --> 16:52.588
Plant yourself, will you?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.614
Now, look at that: no noise.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.962
Let me tell you something.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.964
If you think that your old man

17:01.988 --> 17:03.632
is spinning his wheels,
you know,

17:03.656 --> 17:05.601
there is no law, Mrs. C.,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.903
against trying
something different, you know?

17:07.926 --> 17:10.005
Springing something new on him
every now and then

17:10.029 --> 17:12.273
to keep that fire burning,
so to speak.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.541
Get my drift here?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.777
You take it black, right?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.405
- Oh, yes, thank you, Arthur.
- Yeah. All right.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.415
You mean something different?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.450
- Yes.
- Well, I don't

17:21.473 --> 17:24.086
think that Howard
would go for...

17:24.109 --> 17:25.253
Like what?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.021
All right, couple of weeks ago,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.091
uh, the Hooper triplets--
you know, my dates--

17:29.115 --> 17:30.626
they wanted to try
something different.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.927
They came over to my house

17:31.951 --> 17:33.760
dressed as Huey, Dewey
and Louie, right?

17:36.322 --> 17:39.902
And I got to tell you something,
I spent a month vacuuming...

17:39.926 --> 17:42.605
vacuuming up those feathers,
uh, if you get my drift.

17:42.629 --> 17:46.875
Oh, Arthur,
I couldn't dress up like a duck.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.510
No, I-l guess not.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.779
Mr. C. would have you
carted away.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.182
All right, you don't
have to be as creative

17:53.206 --> 17:55.017
as my chicks,
you know, but, uh...

17:55.041 --> 17:57.219
-(snaps fingers)
- Hey, I heard a story once

17:57.243 --> 18:00.556
about this, uh, this chick
Sherezee... Sherraza...

18:00.580 --> 18:01.724
Scheherazade?

18:01.748 --> 18:02.658
That's it.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.959
<i>The Arabian Nights?</i>

18:03.983 --> 18:05.060
Yeah, something like that.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.495
Yes, I know that.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.097
In order to save her life,

18:08.121 --> 18:10.499
every night she read
the sheik a different story.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.102
And she danced
and she pleased him

18:13.126 --> 18:14.770
in many and various ways.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.871
Yeah.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.473
And he liked it so much

18:17.497 --> 18:20.943
he started to forget about
lopping off her gourd, right?

18:20.967 --> 18:22.277
- Yeah.
- Well, I guess

18:22.301 --> 18:24.513
I could try something different
to save my gourd.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.849
Are you kidding, Mrs. C.?

18:26.873 --> 18:29.785
Mr. C. comes through
those doors, right there,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.353
oh, you'll be right there

18:31.377 --> 18:33.357
to put a snap
in his trunks, huh?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.159
Oh, Arthur...

18:37.183 --> 18:40.029
thank you.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.055
- Hey.
'(Snaps fingers)

18:53.132 --> 18:54.610
Oh, why not?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
Neato. I'll do it.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.750
I'm home, sweetheart.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.519
I've only got time
for a quick bite.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.855
I got to get back down
to the hardware supply house.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.951
Would you believe they sent me
headless sledgehammers?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.028
Did you hear me, Marion?

19:13.052 --> 19:15.864
They sent me some
headless sledgehammers.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.231
(chuckles)

19:19.525 --> 19:22.438
Somebody stole
our dining room set.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.006
What happened to my chair...?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.374
Marion!

19:25.398 --> 19:27.142
What's going on around here?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.168
- Marion?
-(Arabian music playing)

19:45.451 --> 19:46.862
Is that you, Marion?

19:46.886 --> 19:49.064
I am the Princess Fatima.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.332
(finger cymbals clinking)

19:50.356 --> 19:53.669
Welcome to the garden
of delight...

19:53.693 --> 19:56.538
my sheik.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.941
I think maybe
I ought to come in again.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.309
No!

20:00.333 --> 20:04.046
Uh, stay right where you are,
my handsome devil.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.014
The evening is ours.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.651
It is just you and me, sahib.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.553
The children are out.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.690
I think you're out, too, Marion.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.258
Oh, come on, Howard.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.526
Just enjoy it.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.161
Come on,
don't be a party pooper.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.029
Well, at least
she's talking to me.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.365
All right, Fatima,
what's for dinner?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.467
The sheik's in a big hurry.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.469
Couscous.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.338
I think you're
the only one around here

20:29.362 --> 20:32.341
who's "couscous," Marion.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.376
My handsome devil has wit.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.544
(finger cymbals clinking)

20:35.568 --> 20:39.148
Now... make yourself
comfortable.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.216
Well, why should
I sit on the floor

20:41.240 --> 20:44.586
when we've got perfectly
good furniture... somewhere?

20:44.610 --> 20:47.890
If you don't sit down,
you don't eat.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.359
Oh...

20:50.383 --> 20:54.329
Marion, I'll sit down
if you let go of my leg.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.231
Now, where's the silverware?
I'm in a hurry.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.399
What silverware?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.234
I'm gonna feed you.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.903
I'm not in that much of a hurry.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.137
How about a grape, Howard?

21:02.161 --> 21:03.238
Oh...

21:03.262 --> 21:04.807
Let me tell you a story.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.242
Many years ago in Arabia...

21:07.266 --> 21:09.444
Marion, will you come back
to Milwaukee!

21:09.468 --> 21:10.913
Now what's this all about?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.347
Where did you get that outfit?

21:12.371 --> 21:14.449
From Jenny Piccalo's mother.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.119
She said she wouldn't be needing
it back until Veterans' Day.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.587
(finger cymbals clinking)

21:18.611 --> 21:20.689
Strange woman.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.024
Both of you.

21:22.048 --> 21:25.294
Oh, I wanted
the Little Bo Peep outfit,

21:25.318 --> 21:27.457
but Mrs. Piccalo was wearing it.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.765
That figures.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.099
- Have a banana, Howard.
- Oh!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.968
(muffled): Marion,
what are you trying to do to me,

21:32.992 --> 21:34.136
for goodness sake?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.737
-(phone ringing)
- Oh, isn't this fun?

21:35.761 --> 21:38.807
I got to get the phone, Marion.
I haven't got time for this.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.409
How about a grape?

21:40.433 --> 21:41.410
Marion!

21:41.434 --> 21:42.845
Oh, that's it!

21:42.869 --> 21:45.349
Bit rough with me!

21:46.372 --> 21:48.016
Is that you, Floyd?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.518
Yeah, I'm on my way over there.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.720
Yeah, I'm gonna bring down
the sledgehammers.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.989
Marion, will you stop it
with the veil?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.224
Nails?

21:55.248 --> 21:57.459
No, I didn't say
anything about nails.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.863
No, Fatima here is trying
to put a veil over...

22:00.887 --> 22:02.164
Never mind, Floyd.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.099
'G°°¢hy, goochy, goo!
-(laughs) Stop it.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.001
-(laughing)
- Goochy, goochy, goo!

22:06.025 --> 22:07.069
Stop it!

22:07.093 --> 22:09.805
No, no, I'm not
laughing at you, Floyd.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.139
Marion, will you go out

22:11.163 --> 22:14.076
and feed the camel,
for goodness sake?

22:14.100 --> 22:15.577
Marion, stop this!

22:15.601 --> 22:17.412
This is an important call.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.914
- Yeah, Floyd?
- Oh.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.482
And I'm not important?

22:20.506 --> 22:21.507
Uh-huh...

22:28.180 --> 22:29.858
Floyd, can I call you back?

22:29.882 --> 22:32.427
I got a handful of couscous.

22:32.451 --> 22:36.598
Oh, Marion,
what is going on around here?

22:36.622 --> 22:38.624
What's the matter with you?

22:41.127 --> 22:43.672
Marion, will you stop
rearranging the furniture!

22:43.696 --> 22:44.740
I'm sorry.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.775
You want a fast dinner?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.176
Right.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.178
Here it is.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.513
And if you don't like it,

22:51.537 --> 22:53.982
maybe you and Wally Moss
can pick up a couple of chicks

22:54.006 --> 22:55.350
and go and eat at Disneyland.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.581
What on earth
are you talking about?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.889
Well, that's what
you're planning, isn't it?

23:00.913 --> 23:02.224
You're gonna dump me

23:02.248 --> 23:04.226
and you're gonna get somebody
young and exciting

23:04.250 --> 23:07.129
like little Peggy Sue
who will kindle your flame.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.130
Neato.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.399
My flame is kindled enough.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.734
Now where did you ever get
a cockamamie idea like this?

23:12.758 --> 23:16.471
Because you're bored
and because I... don't...

23:16.495 --> 23:18.440
tickle your fancy anymore.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.642
Don't tell me
you don't tickle my fancy.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.044
I'll tell you that

23:22.068 --> 23:23.312
and I'll tell you
something else.

23:23.336 --> 23:26.148
You're gonna dump me
because I'm middle-aged.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.174
Well, of c...

23:29.642 --> 23:31.586
...of course you're middle-aged.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.255
- Oh...
- And so am I.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.886
And it was always my plan
that we would grow old together.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.828
But in a larger room.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.200
Marion, I am perfectly content

23:45.224 --> 23:47.469
to live out my life with you.

23:47.493 --> 23:51.106
Oh, Howard.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.743
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.946
Oh, what am I doing
in this silly outfit?

23:57.970 --> 24:00.983
My husband loves me.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.009
- Come here.
-(finger cymbals clinking)

24:27.533 --> 24:29.344
Well, one thing's for sure:

24:29.368 --> 24:31.780
we raised a smart family.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.808
Now, I'm gonna run those hammers
over and I'll be right back.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.487
- Your harem will be waiting.
-(finger cymbals clinking)

24:38.511 --> 24:40.491
(chuckles)

24:43.983 --> 24:45.985
The hammers can wait!
