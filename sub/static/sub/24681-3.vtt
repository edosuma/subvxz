00:22.035 --> 00:26.199
Fontayne, you're on.

00:26.273 --> 00:28.241
This guy's corked. You
should tell him to go home.

00:28.308 --> 00:31.072
Yeah, you don't shut
up, you're going home.

00:32.579 --> 00:35.707
<i>Give a big Xanadu
welcome to Fontayne!</i>

00:47.861 --> 00:52.389
Okay, that's it.
Good class, everybody.

00:56.570 --> 01:01.906
Amanda, there was a man
asking for you this morning.

01:02.442 --> 01:06.003
A fat, disgusting man,
Latin.

01:06.079 --> 01:08.479
He said he was a friend from Xanadu.

01:10.283 --> 01:13.309
I don't like these friends
coming to my school.

01:19.393 --> 01:21.588
Don't worry about it.
If he keeps coming around,

01:21.661 --> 01:23.185
we'll send you to
the club in Jersey.

01:23.263 --> 01:25.254
I'm not dancing in Jersey.

01:25.332 --> 01:26.526
If this guy starts
making trouble for me...

01:26.600 --> 01:28.329
You'll what?

01:28.402 --> 01:31.667
You open your mouth, you
won't be dancing anywhere.

01:33.974 --> 01:35.635
Mom, if I come
home this weekend,

01:35.709 --> 01:37.609
do you think
you can get off work?

01:39.112 --> 01:42.639
Of course I'm fine, I just
haven't been home in a while.

01:43.884 --> 01:47.149
Hey, look, I gotta get
back. Love you, too.

01:50.157 --> 01:53.092
Amanda. I want to talk to you. Ow!

01:53.160 --> 01:55.025
Let go. Hey.

01:55.095 --> 01:56.926
Sorry.
Hey, will you walk me in?

01:56.997 --> 01:58.157
Sure.

02:04.805 --> 02:07.740
Good night,
honey. See you tomorrow.

02:19.119 --> 02:21.849
I am not clipping him. It's not natural.

02:21.922 --> 02:24.618
He's a toy poodle. He
was bred to be a toy.

02:25.792 --> 02:28.727
Oh, great. Papillon!

02:31.331 --> 02:34.698
Papillon. Papillon,
stop it! Get off...

02:36.336 --> 02:37.701
Oh, my God!

02:40.373 --> 02:43.774
Jeez! There's animals in
there eating a dead body.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.656
She was last seen Friday
night leaving the strip club.

03:36.730 --> 03:40.188
So what did this girl do to rate
a couple of Major Case honchos?

03:40.267 --> 03:43.100
Her club's been getting a
shakedown from the Masuccis.

03:43.169 --> 03:46.332
Her Missing Persons report
mentioned the day she disappeared,

03:46.406 --> 03:49.637
somebody from Xanadu came looking
for her at her dance school.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.507
Yeah, the teacher said
it was a guy in a suit,

03:52.579 --> 03:55.173
large build,
could've been Hispanic.

03:56.349 --> 03:59.409
Animals were feeding on
her when she was found.

03:59.519 --> 04:03.421
Coyotes, judging by the paw
prints. The whole muscle was taken.

04:04.524 --> 04:06.651
A different kind
of animal did this.

04:06.726 --> 04:10.719
Deep gouges in the skin,
lots of bleeding and swelling.

04:10.797 --> 04:12.128
Now, these blisters...

04:13.934 --> 04:18.894
Dead skin doesn't dissipate heat.
He gave her a bath, postmortem.

04:19.873 --> 04:22.899
The lividity pattern
doesn't match her position.

04:22.976 --> 04:26.742
He kept her long enough for lividity
to set before dumping her here.

04:26.813 --> 04:28.110
Her position...

04:30.917 --> 04:34.148
He didn't leave her face
up and naked, vulnerable.

04:35.188 --> 04:38.123
Or humiliated with her
face down in the mud.

04:41.394 --> 04:45.763
Instead, he dressed her and left her
like this, on her side, sheltered.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.967
And with her dignity.

04:50.403 --> 04:51.961
Her mom know if
she had a boyfriend?

04:52.672 --> 04:55.732
Mom? She didn't even
know about the strip club.

04:57.877 --> 05:02.473
She said she was working in a
nice restaurant, with nice people.

05:06.086 --> 05:10.147
I want to know what they
did to my baby. Everything.

05:10.890 --> 05:14.291
You told Missing Persons Amanda
called you on Friday night.

05:14.361 --> 05:16.386
She would've
been at work.

05:16.596 --> 05:18.257
Any special
reason she called?

05:18.331 --> 05:20.731
She wanted to come
for a visit next week.

05:22.702 --> 05:24.727
I guess she missed me.

05:25.939 --> 05:27.930
Thank you,
Mrs. Norman.

05:29.242 --> 05:32.211
The officer will drive
you back to New Jersey.

05:32.278 --> 05:35.873
We couldn't
afford that dance school,

05:37.417 --> 05:39.510
that's why she
had to take a job.

05:41.688 --> 05:44.384
She was so pretty
in her ballet shoes.

05:47.027 --> 05:50.190
Bad luck her daughter took
a job in a Masucci front.

05:50.263 --> 05:52.060
Maybe she saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

05:52.132 --> 05:54.066
It's not reading
like a mob thing.

05:54.134 --> 05:55.931
The way the
body was posed,

05:56.636 --> 06:02.506
the killer might have a close,
emotional connection to her.

06:02.809 --> 06:04.299
The M.E. Have
any evidence how close?

06:04.377 --> 06:07.403
No sexual trauma,
no semen in or out.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.917
Preliminary cause of death is a
subdural hematoma on her left temple.

06:11.985 --> 06:16.547
Kids don't call late at night just to
say hi. Something spooked this girl.

06:19.893 --> 06:24.330
This is Kelly Jane. She was the
last person to see Amanda on Friday.

06:24.397 --> 06:26.058
They were tight, right,
Kelly?

06:26.132 --> 06:28.157
That's right.
She was nice.

06:28.868 --> 06:30.267
She says Amanda
didn't tell her

06:30.336 --> 06:32.804
who visited her
at her dance school.

06:32.872 --> 06:35.932
Are you sure that she
didn't meet someone here?

06:36.009 --> 06:37.909
She wouldn't give the
creeps here the time of day.

06:37.977 --> 06:42.346
Really? Maybe
she was having pay dates.

06:42.415 --> 06:44.178
That's who
did this to her.

06:46.653 --> 06:48.484
She was not a whore.

06:50.090 --> 06:53.218
Her wrist, the guy
who came to her class,

06:53.293 --> 06:54.885
he did that to
her on Friday night.

06:55.762 --> 06:59.459
He caught Amanda outside on her
break. He almost took her arm off,

06:59.532 --> 07:01.625
except some other guy
helped her back inside.

07:01.701 --> 07:03.396
What was his problem with Amanda?

07:03.470 --> 07:05.097
He thinks we
ripped him off.

07:05.171 --> 07:06.832
He came in last month,
drunk,

07:06.906 --> 07:09.340
and bragging he was
"king of the world. "

07:09.409 --> 07:11.502
Mike set him up
in the VIP room,

07:11.578 --> 07:14.513
he started sending in
girls, starting with Amanda,

07:15.181 --> 07:16.773
and running up the
guy's credit cards.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.374
How much?

07:18.651 --> 07:19.811
<i>140 grand.</i>

07:23.156 --> 07:27.149
For lap dances? How
big was this guy's lap?

07:29.963 --> 07:32.397
I was drunk. I only
remember the first girl,

07:32.465 --> 07:34.023
Fontayne, a brunette.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.094
We can't do
anything with stage names,

07:36.169 --> 07:37.966
and since the
women all wear wigs...

07:38.037 --> 07:40.665
Amanda. Amanda Norman.

07:40.740 --> 07:43.106
I hired a private detective
to find out her name.

07:43.643 --> 07:45.770
My lawyer said if I got
her to sign a statement,

07:45.845 --> 07:47.472
the credit card companies
might waive the charges.

07:47.547 --> 07:49.811
So you've talked to her? Maybe
Friday night outside the club?

07:49.883 --> 07:51.441
Maybe it got
a little emotional.

07:51.518 --> 07:52.815
Emotional?

07:53.353 --> 07:55.321
Is she saying
I roughed her up?

07:55.388 --> 07:56.719
It's funny you
should say that.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.655
Does she look
roughed up to you?

07:58.725 --> 08:02.058
Oh, my God.
I didn't do that.

08:02.128 --> 08:04.653
Maybe I grabbed her
arm, just to talk to her.

08:04.731 --> 08:07.700
Then this guy, a customer, he
helped her, he took her inside.

08:07.767 --> 08:08.927
That's it.

08:11.004 --> 08:13.564
That's it?
You went home?

08:14.174 --> 08:15.266
Well, we'll verify
that with your wife.

08:15.341 --> 08:18.902
I waited in my car
until she finished work.

08:18.978 --> 08:20.536
She went into a restaurant
across the street.

08:20.613 --> 08:21.910
I was gonna
go talk to her,

08:21.981 --> 08:24.381
but then I saw she was
sitting with her boyfriend.

08:24.450 --> 08:25.974
What did this boyfriend
look like?

08:26.052 --> 08:27.952
I couldn't tell, his
back was to the window.

08:28.021 --> 08:31.252
But she was sitting with
her head on his shoulder.

08:33.827 --> 08:36.125
She was in that
booth, by herself.

08:36.196 --> 08:37.527
This guy sat down at the counter,

08:37.597 --> 08:39.188
I didn't think
they knew each other.

08:39.265 --> 08:40.289
And then I went
into the kitchen,

08:40.366 --> 08:41.765
'cause Artie messed up an order.

08:41.835 --> 08:43.325
And when I came back,
they were sitting together.

08:43.403 --> 08:46.304
You think you could give a
description to a sketch artist?

08:46.372 --> 08:48.272
I can try. The guy was pretty ordinary.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.002
And how was
he to talk to?

08:50.076 --> 08:52.943
He didn't talk to me.
Well, I think he wanted to.

08:53.012 --> 08:55.947
But every time I'd look at him,
he'd just smile and look away.

08:56.015 --> 08:58.643
He was a...
He was shy.

08:58.718 --> 09:00.151
Right, a shy guy.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.653
Did you see them leave
together?

09:01.721 --> 09:05.122
Yeah. He had to help her.
She looked drunk or something.

09:05.191 --> 09:06.783
Did she come in drunk?

09:06.860 --> 09:07.952
No.

09:08.127 --> 09:11.563
She just went from zero to
stoned in two seconds flat?

09:12.665 --> 09:16.465
Before they left, did either
of them get up from the booth?

09:17.670 --> 09:20.400
He did, to get a refill on her iced tea.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.632
More coffee, please.

09:21.708 --> 09:22.868
Excuse me.

09:24.477 --> 09:25.967
He spiked her tea.

09:26.779 --> 09:28.770
MO of a sexual predator.

09:30.283 --> 09:32.717
But the preliminary exam
didn't show any signs of a rape.

09:32.785 --> 09:35.276
Maybe they didn't look hard enough.

09:36.256 --> 09:40.022
Well, this port of entry's
untouched, same as the other two.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.058
Maybe he brought her
home to play pinochle.

09:43.129 --> 09:46.462
Toxicology found high levels
of antihistamine in her system,

09:46.532 --> 09:47.965
enough to knock her out.

09:48.034 --> 09:50.264
That's probably what he
loaded into her iced tea.

09:50.336 --> 09:51.598
These marks
on the bone...

09:51.671 --> 09:52.865
Canine teeth marks.

09:52.939 --> 09:57.433
No, underneath that.
There's two straight lines.

10:11.858 --> 10:15.851
Cut marks, from a knife,
just about

10:16.729 --> 10:20.688
where the calf muscle
joins the Achilles tendon.

10:24.237 --> 10:25.636
And here,
another one very faint,

10:25.705 --> 10:28.799
where the muscle
attaches behind the knee.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.709
He took the calf muscle
and left the rest.

10:37.617 --> 10:39.585
The calf muscle
was taken postmortem,

10:39.652 --> 10:42.246
so inflicting pain wasn't the point.

10:42.655 --> 10:45.021
The tox came back
positive for chloroform.

10:45.091 --> 10:46.251
He probably
kept her drugged

10:46.326 --> 10:48.726
for the three days
he had her.

10:48.795 --> 10:51.923
If he hasn't already,
he'll probably try again.

10:51.998 --> 10:55.365
Let's get this out. Clinton
area and Fort Tryon Park.

10:59.138 --> 11:00.867
You try too hard to
get inside his head,

11:00.940 --> 11:02.931
you'll give yourself
a migraine.

11:03.009 --> 11:05.500
The waitress said that
he was shy.

11:05.578 --> 11:09.070
Maybe he was too shy to initiate
a conversation with Amanda.

11:09.148 --> 11:10.342
She might have known him.

11:10.416 --> 11:14.944
That time of night, he could've
come out of the club, a customer.

11:15.521 --> 11:18.718
Her friend said Amanda wouldn't
give those guys the time of day.

11:18.791 --> 11:23.353
Well, when Mr. Feijo
grabbed her,

11:23.830 --> 11:28.961
the guy who helped her out, her white
knight, him she might've talked to.

11:33.806 --> 11:35.398
Okay, that's me,
so what?

11:35.475 --> 11:36.703
The "so what" is

11:36.776 --> 11:39.438
Amanda Norman was last seen
with your little friend here.

11:39.512 --> 11:42.345
We need to know what
you two talked about.

11:42.815 --> 11:45.477
Nothing. I asked him if
he wanted to buy a dance.

11:45.551 --> 11:47.143
He didn't,
so I left.

11:47.954 --> 11:50.445
What about that,
what did he say?

11:51.190 --> 11:54.421
He said that I shouldn't put
champagne so close to the candle,

11:54.494 --> 11:56.359
the heat makes the bubbles go away.

11:56.429 --> 11:58.226
Look, can I go? I really
have to call my babysitter.

11:58.297 --> 12:00.765
Just... Just...
This little exchange.

12:03.703 --> 12:07.366
I asked him if he wanted a
date after I got off work.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.668
He said that
I wasn't his type.

12:09.442 --> 12:13.276
Really? Did he say
what his type was?

12:14.847 --> 12:17.782
Someone soft, who wouldn't hustle him

12:17.850 --> 12:19.613
and keep
checking their watch.

12:21.621 --> 12:26.684
Okay, Frankie, you can
go call your babysitter now.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.488
Thanks.

12:32.165 --> 12:36.795
He was looking for a
girlfriend, someone who'd stay.

12:41.541 --> 12:44.601
We should take another
look at that head wound.

12:45.978 --> 12:49.379
There are three puncture-type
wounds, different depths,

12:49.449 --> 12:51.246
none of which
penetrated the skull.

12:51.317 --> 12:53.842
Maybe that's what he
wanted to do,

12:54.253 --> 12:56.915
penetrate the skull, but
the bleeding stopped him.

12:56.989 --> 12:58.889
Well, nothing bleeds like a head wound.

12:58.958 --> 13:00.220
On the other side
of the bone.

13:00.293 --> 13:01.783
The left
prefrontal cortex.

13:01.861 --> 13:05.092
It controls behavior,
judgment.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.426
Any previous homicides
with a wound like this?

13:09.502 --> 13:10.935
No, not in
New York County.

13:11.003 --> 13:13.665
I'll check the other
boroughs and emergency rooms.

13:13.739 --> 13:17.300
You wouldn't believe what
gets written off as accidental.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.173
It's four hours
just to get there,

13:19.245 --> 13:21.110
it's the same weather as we get here,

13:21.180 --> 13:24.581
it's wall-to-wall cars, and what's
the point of living in the city

13:24.650 --> 13:26.914
if you don't stay here to enjoy it.

13:28.688 --> 13:32.124
I like the weekends,
when the city gets empty.

13:33.759 --> 13:36.319
You get the whole place
to yourself.

13:36.729 --> 13:39.061
Anyway, my friend bagged out,

13:39.132 --> 13:43.364
so I have an extra ticket to this
concert tonight, all different artists.

13:43.436 --> 13:45.427
What kind of music
do you like?

13:51.244 --> 13:53.405
I guess old country western.

13:56.215 --> 14:01.778
My parents always listened
to it. I grew up a...

14:04.690 --> 14:08.524
I'm gonna get a protein bar and
then I'm gonna have to get going.

14:09.195 --> 14:10.526
Oh, okay.

14:25.344 --> 14:28.177
She was found wandering around
Canarsie yesterday morning

14:28.247 --> 14:30.215
in a negligee and no ID.

14:30.283 --> 14:32.911
She was incoherent, couldn't
give officers a name.

14:32.985 --> 14:34.077
We're canvassing
the neighborhood

14:34.153 --> 14:35.313
for any wits who
might have seen her.

14:35.388 --> 14:36.480
They do a rape kit
on her?

14:36.556 --> 14:37.887
Yeah, it came up negative.

14:37.957 --> 14:39.424
Hospital ran a tox.

14:39.492 --> 14:41.084
She came up positive
for some kind of

14:41.160 --> 14:43.128
antihistamine
and chloroform.

14:43.196 --> 14:44.322
Any other injuries?

14:44.397 --> 14:47.127
No, just an old bruise
on her right knee.

14:53.673 --> 14:59.236
Hi. I'm Detective Goren,
this is Detective Eames.

15:03.516 --> 15:05.006
We're here to help you.

15:10.022 --> 15:11.011
Help...

15:12.391 --> 15:14.825
"Help me. "
Is that what you said?

15:16.262 --> 15:17.388
I'm cold.

15:17.463 --> 15:20.296
You cold? We can take care of that.

15:30.743 --> 15:34.110
Doctor, her speech, her comprehension,

15:34.180 --> 15:36.410
what are the chances
she'll recover?

15:37.083 --> 15:39.313
With the level of brain
damage she suffered,

15:39.385 --> 15:42.081
language and memory deficits
are typically permanent.

15:42.154 --> 15:44.247
You took a photo
of the injury.

15:44.323 --> 15:45.381
I'm no forensic expert,

15:45.458 --> 15:48.586
but my guess is it was done
with a common household drill.

15:48.661 --> 15:50.629
The injury penetrated
the dural membrane.

15:50.696 --> 15:52.129
Bad as that sounds,
it's not what caused

15:52.198 --> 15:54.189
the damage to
her frontal lobe.

15:54.267 --> 15:58.203
We did a spinal tap. We found
her spinal fluid was hypotonic.

16:00.039 --> 16:01.267
It was diluted?

16:01.340 --> 16:02.432
With hot water.

16:03.476 --> 16:06.468
There was slight scalding
on the brain tissue.

16:07.079 --> 16:11.106
He drilled a hole in her skull
and poured hot water on her brain.

16:12.652 --> 16:14.415
A homemade lobotomy.

16:16.389 --> 16:21.224
He wanted someone who wouldn't be in
a hurry to leave, someone who'd stay.

16:22.128 --> 16:23.618
A living doll.

16:30.069 --> 16:32.537
There are 10,000 apartments within
minutes of where she was found.

16:32.605 --> 16:34.766
She could've escaped
from any one of them.

16:35.941 --> 16:40.037
Probably while he was
out, maybe at work.

16:40.980 --> 16:43.744
The tox report said that she
was doped with chloroform.

16:43.816 --> 16:47.547
Chloroform has to be administered
at least every six hours.

16:47.887 --> 16:50.549
She was coming out of a
stupor when she was found.

16:50.623 --> 16:52.147
I don't see restraint
marks on this girl.

16:52.224 --> 16:53.282
There aren't any.

16:53.359 --> 16:56.328
You'd expect that he'd keep
her tied up, or at least gagged.

16:56.395 --> 16:57.726
But instead,
he used something

16:57.797 --> 16:59.424
that he thought
was more reliable.

16:59.498 --> 17:01.295
Drugs and
a lobotomy.

17:02.268 --> 17:03.633
Somebody made her.

17:08.007 --> 17:10.031
Claire and I went to the
gym after work Friday.

17:10.108 --> 17:13.271
We were supposed to go
to a concert later, but...

17:13.746 --> 17:15.304
Ms. Gillespie,
you're not responsible

17:15.381 --> 17:17.372
for what happened
to Claire.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.184
Does this look like
somebody she might know?

17:20.252 --> 17:22.982
Maybe he works in the
building or the gym.

17:23.055 --> 17:24.715
I've never
seen him before.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.724
Why don't you tell us
about Claire's routine?

17:28.194 --> 17:32.756
She gets in at 9:00, goes
to the gym on her lunch hour.

17:32.832 --> 17:34.026
That's like church for her.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.665
Even when she banged up her right
knee on the treadmill last week,

17:36.736 --> 17:38.727
she still went every day.

17:38.804 --> 17:41.705
You said last Friday
she went after work.

17:42.308 --> 17:44.037
Sometimes she goes
twice a day. It depends.

17:44.110 --> 17:46.601
On what? She cheat on her diet?

17:46.679 --> 17:48.169
I always see
her eat healthy.

17:49.348 --> 17:51.646
Maybe a secret binger.

17:51.717 --> 17:52.979
Homeopathic pills.

17:55.755 --> 18:01.318
For sensitivity to caffeine.
She drink coffee or soda?

18:01.660 --> 18:04.128
Just sports drinks and herbal tea.

18:05.765 --> 18:08.029
Secret binge...

18:08.100 --> 18:09.624
Chocolate has caffeine.

18:11.303 --> 18:12.600
Is there a store nearby?

18:12.671 --> 18:15.663
You know, the kind that
sells champagne truffles?

18:17.943 --> 18:20.275
You know, I've been told, when they boil

18:20.346 --> 18:22.007
the filling of these champagne truffles,

18:22.081 --> 18:25.380
the heat makes the champagne
bubbles go away. Is that true?

18:25.451 --> 18:26.577
Yes, it is.

18:26.652 --> 18:28.051
Our niece told
us about your place.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.144
She comes here all the time.

18:29.221 --> 18:31.689
Her name's Claire, she works
across the street. No, I...

18:31.757 --> 18:34.920
She's a brunette, got long hair.

18:35.661 --> 18:40.689
Oh, sure, sure, she was in last
Monday. Well, she's in every week.

18:40.766 --> 18:42.700
For a pound of the cappuccino
truffles. Thank you.

18:42.768 --> 18:44.668
You can actually watch
them make the chocolates.

18:44.737 --> 18:45.726
Isn't that great?

18:45.838 --> 18:49.296
You know, I'd bet that
Willy Wonka works here.

18:50.309 --> 18:53.574
That's what I want, I want
one of those fresh ones.

18:57.516 --> 18:59.848
You know, I heard that,

18:59.919 --> 19:02.149
you know, chocolate
can be an aphrodisiac.

19:02.488 --> 19:05.252
It's been a little
slow at home lately,

19:05.324 --> 19:07.019
maybe I should
have another one...

19:20.840 --> 19:22.239
Looks yummy.

19:25.211 --> 19:27.372
Are those champagne truffles?

19:27.446 --> 19:30.904
Yes, and butter cream.

19:34.787 --> 19:36.687
Can I try some filling?

19:38.491 --> 19:40.686
That's okay, just
put some on my finger.

19:48.534 --> 19:51.094
That is so delicious.
Thank you.

19:55.875 --> 20:00.175
The shy guy. Shy as
a kid in short pants.

20:11.790 --> 20:15.021
He likes to watch
and watch and watch.

20:16.362 --> 20:18.023
Maybe he's
picking up pointers.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.459
After work, he walked
around for an hour,

20:23.536 --> 20:27.131
then it was back to the park
for some more girl watching.

20:27.239 --> 20:30.106
Two hours later, he
drove home to Canarsie,

20:30.175 --> 20:33.406
eight blocks from where the
girl was found wandering.

20:33.479 --> 20:34.946
Now you have my attention.

20:35.014 --> 20:36.675
Well, the neighbors don't remember

20:36.749 --> 20:38.808
ever seeing Tagman
with the girls,

20:38.884 --> 20:42.376
or ever seeing him with a girlfriend.

20:42.454 --> 20:44.513
We got a unit sitting on
him. But we need paper.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.148
We gotta look at his
car and his apartment.

20:46.225 --> 20:48.022
Not on this evidence.

20:50.663 --> 20:52.130
John Tagman.

20:55.668 --> 20:58.330
That sound like
a common name to you?

20:58.404 --> 20:59.530
Common enough.

21:01.907 --> 21:03.738
Better we don't ask.

21:06.045 --> 21:07.808
Tagman, John.

21:09.448 --> 21:11.746
Here, there's
a John Tagman

21:11.817 --> 21:13.751
with an outstanding
warrant from Virginia,

21:13.819 --> 21:18.279
for burglary, Caucasian, 6
feet, brown hair and eyes.

21:21.060 --> 21:24.757
For all we know, our Tagman
could be a Virginia transplant.

21:25.731 --> 21:27.995
I'll call it in to
the warrant squad.

21:30.636 --> 21:32.536
Don't move!
Don't move!

21:32.838 --> 21:34.328
You John Tagman?
Yes.

21:34.406 --> 21:36.499
We have a warrant for
your arrest from Virginia.

21:36.575 --> 21:39.203
I've never been to Virginia.
What are you...

21:42.448 --> 21:44.780
I'm about to execute a search
warrant on Tagman's place.

21:44.850 --> 21:47.011
You're welcome to join me.

21:49.588 --> 21:51.385
He has anatomy books.

21:53.392 --> 21:57.453
And these, cranial
surgery, dissections.

21:57.863 --> 22:00.889
Looks like Tagman went over
the place with a toothbrush,

22:00.966 --> 22:03.628
probably right after the girl escaped.

22:05.137 --> 22:06.126
Been drinking.

22:06.205 --> 22:08.105
And plans
to keep drinking.

22:09.608 --> 22:12.133
No frozen dinners, just cups of ice.

22:20.052 --> 22:21.383
Eames...

22:23.789 --> 22:26.553
Well, well,
the smoking drill.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.557
Bit's missing. Looks like
the motor's been cleaned.

22:37.703 --> 22:39.102
Not enough.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.400
Tagman, John.

22:42.474 --> 22:43.566
Here, that's me.

22:43.976 --> 22:45.307
Come on,
you're being released.

22:45.377 --> 22:46.742
They got you mixed
up with somebody else.

22:46.812 --> 22:48.939
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

22:51.016 --> 22:53.314
Oh, you found
his porn stash.

22:53.385 --> 22:54.875
It's not what you'd expect.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.518
No bondage,
no violent fantasies.

22:59.591 --> 23:01.991
He saved those for real life.

23:02.061 --> 23:04.325
Okay, everybody, Mr.
Tagman just got kicked.

23:04.396 --> 23:06.387
We need to
cease and desist.

23:06.465 --> 23:08.126
Now.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.258
We don't have him.

23:09.334 --> 23:11.928
Eames, you and your partner, come on.

23:23.615 --> 23:25.776
An arrest you knew was
false on its face...

23:25.851 --> 23:29.844
The Tagman on the warrant had a phony
social security and multiple DOBs.

23:29.922 --> 23:31.253
It could've been
the same guy.

23:31.323 --> 23:32.449
Don't push it, Detective.

23:32.524 --> 23:35.721
The lab found a bone chip in the
drill housing. There was no DNA.

23:35.794 --> 23:38.524
They can't even tell if
it was animal or human.

23:38.597 --> 23:41.259
As far as his car, he
probably had it detailed.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.860
If these belong to Mr. Tagman,
see that he gets them back today.

23:44.937 --> 23:48.065
Oh, no, I bought these.
Tagman has the same ones.

23:48.574 --> 23:51.543
Nothing explicit.
They're almost adolescent.

23:56.148 --> 23:59.242
Well, maybe that's the
way in. A big brother.

24:01.053 --> 24:04.022
You know, I'm gonna
need a meal voucher.

24:07.159 --> 24:09.525
You know,
to offer our apologies.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.467
Take it easy with that.

24:20.005 --> 24:22.940
Mr. Tagman?
I'm Detective Goren.

24:24.910 --> 24:27.470
Hey, they are so sorry
about this mix-up.

24:27.546 --> 24:30.037
It's okay.
It was a mistake.

24:31.116 --> 24:34.745
Well, least you can do is let
the Department buy us lunch.

24:36.355 --> 24:38.050
I got a meal voucher.

24:38.323 --> 24:39.483
I don't know...

24:39.558 --> 24:40.923
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

24:40.993 --> 24:44.360
There's a couple of places around
the corner. They look pretty good.

24:50.536 --> 24:52.333
Every Sunday, I'd ride all
the way through Canarsie.

24:52.404 --> 24:54.167
All the way
to the beach.

24:55.541 --> 24:58.009
It was easier
being a kid back then.

24:59.745 --> 25:02.441
You're not from here,
are you?

25:02.514 --> 25:03.640
Lake George.

25:04.283 --> 25:07.741
My parents live there.
They're elderly. They...

25:10.656 --> 25:11.987
Thank you.

25:14.626 --> 25:16.924
Yeah, now I know why
you brought us here.

25:16.995 --> 25:19.225
She's cute.
You ever ask her out?

25:19.932 --> 25:21.263
No.

25:28.173 --> 25:29.663
Is that
more your type?

25:31.844 --> 25:34.039
No, I don't have a type.

25:36.615 --> 25:40.346
Word of advice, John.
Women respond to confidence.

25:42.788 --> 25:43.812
When I was a kid at that beach,

25:43.889 --> 25:45.481
I used to watch guys
try to pick up girls,

25:45.557 --> 25:47.787
what worked,
what didn't work.

25:50.829 --> 25:51.955
It helped?

25:53.465 --> 25:54.591
Eventually.

25:58.503 --> 26:01.666
This chili is hot. Maybe
I should get you a beer.

26:03.308 --> 26:04.798
No, thank you.

26:05.911 --> 26:09.779
I thought you liked beer. You
had empties all over your place.

26:14.419 --> 26:17.980
Drinking,
it's a recent thing?

26:20.826 --> 26:24.694
I guess so.
I wasn't paying attention.

26:29.434 --> 26:32.699
You ever ask yourself why you drink?

26:35.774 --> 26:36.798
Yes.

26:36.875 --> 26:37.864
And?

26:41.480 --> 26:47.009
I don't think it's possible for
a person to understand himself.

26:50.589 --> 26:53.422
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

26:54.526 --> 26:57.461
You've done things that
you don't understand.

27:03.568 --> 27:06.537
Just make sure that every
item on the list is here.

27:06.605 --> 27:07.663
Check it off.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.001
"Get Hooked on a Book. "

27:11.476 --> 27:14.138
Bookmark design,
John Tagman, first prize.

27:16.381 --> 27:18.713
How old were you?

27:18.784 --> 27:19.842
Fourth grade.

27:19.918 --> 27:22.216
This is what I was
talking about, John.

27:22.287 --> 27:24.187
You know,
you bring a woman here,

27:24.923 --> 27:28.450
she gets one look at this
and your grammar-school prize.

27:28.527 --> 27:30.256
Women can be harsh.

27:30.829 --> 27:32.797
Yeah, they never
give you a chance.

27:32.864 --> 27:36.265
I guess you've gotten used
to being by yourself, huh?

27:36.835 --> 27:38.894
Is that what you're saying?

27:38.971 --> 27:40.734
You don't really get used to it.

27:44.443 --> 27:49.039
No, you... No, you don't
really ever get used to it.

27:53.151 --> 27:55.016
Chili made me thirsty.

27:58.256 --> 27:59.780
Think I can get
a glass of water?

27:59.858 --> 28:01.018
Sure.

28:10.268 --> 28:12.463
What are you... Please, that's private.

28:12.537 --> 28:14.368
Hey, don't be embarrassed.
Come on, it's classy stuff.

28:14.439 --> 28:15.701
It's...

28:15.774 --> 28:17.264
None of that
pneumatic grinding.

28:18.210 --> 28:21.941
It celebrates intimacy. Is
that what you like, John?

28:23.849 --> 28:26.374
Cuddling, holding her close to you?

28:28.620 --> 28:31.282
I don't know. I'd appreciate
it if you turned that off.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.588
Okay. Whoops.

28:36.061 --> 28:39.189
Something wrong with your
DVD. Let me scan back.

28:42.868 --> 28:46.634
All right. Yeah, see
that stutter right there?

28:47.205 --> 28:51.665
Now that happens when you freeze-frame
too often on the same spot.

28:52.077 --> 28:57.242
You like the legs, right? Back of
the legs, that muscle right there.

28:58.950 --> 29:04.354
Especially in runners,
dancers...

29:04.423 --> 29:06.482
I really have to
do my errands now.

29:07.059 --> 29:10.927
Okay, I still need you to
sign off on that receipt.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.959
You know, John, with
all our complaining,

29:17.035 --> 29:19.333
it's women who
are vulnerable.

29:20.972 --> 29:24.066
I was just thinking about
that girl they found,

29:25.911 --> 29:29.438
last Monday, a few blocks
from here. Hole in her head?

29:30.916 --> 29:33.146
Did you hear about that?

29:33.218 --> 29:34.845
Yeah, that was just terrible.

29:35.387 --> 29:36.877
She's brain damaged.

29:38.256 --> 29:40.224
You know,
never be normal again.

29:41.793 --> 29:43.988
She can't even
remember her own name.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.092
People do terrible things.

29:55.407 --> 29:58.137
How was your play date?
Did Johnny share his toys?

29:58.210 --> 30:01.702
He's fixated on women's
calves. And he keeps souvenirs.

30:02.180 --> 30:03.738
You saw me
check his fridge.

30:03.815 --> 30:07.478
If he kept Amanda Norman's body
part to moon over, it's gone now.

30:07.552 --> 30:09.713
He wouldn't have
gotten rid of it.

30:10.222 --> 30:12.383
It's too important. And
he wouldn't let it go bad,

30:12.457 --> 30:14.220
he'd keep it refrigerated.

30:16.428 --> 30:17.895
The cups of ice.

30:19.965 --> 30:22.365
He kept staring at the
bodega across the street.

30:39.417 --> 30:42.545
Talk about your frozen treats.
I'll call CSU.

30:44.523 --> 30:47.822
The DNA matched. It's
definitely Amanda Norman's.

30:48.894 --> 30:52.421
Bad news is, Tagman's fingerprints
aren't on the packaging.

30:52.497 --> 30:54.965
But they are on the
outside of the freezer.

30:55.033 --> 30:57.194
Which only proves he's
been in that bodega.

30:57.269 --> 30:59.601
This report says
"partial calf muscle. "

30:59.671 --> 31:01.104
Didn't he take
the whole muscle?

31:01.173 --> 31:03.801
The muscle
had been cleaned.

31:03.875 --> 31:05.809
A portion of it
had been sliced off.

31:06.611 --> 31:10.809
It's possible that
Tagman may have eaten it.

31:11.983 --> 31:13.644
It just gets worse with this guy.

31:13.752 --> 31:16.050
I'd like to see it
get much worse for him.

31:16.121 --> 31:17.816
Any other evidence?
Just this.

31:17.889 --> 31:20.653
The lab determined the
head wounds on both girls

31:20.725 --> 31:22.852
were made with the same drill bit.

31:23.195 --> 31:27.928
We're short one piece of direct evidence
connecting Mr. Tagman to either girl.

31:28.900 --> 31:33.530
You bring me that piece, I'll close
the book on Mr. Tagman for good.

31:34.906 --> 31:36.203
Close the book?

31:36.274 --> 31:39.038
I'm charging him with murder one,
I intend to seek the death penalty.

31:39.110 --> 31:40.372
Well, this isn't murder one.

31:40.445 --> 31:43.039
Kidnap, torture, murder.

31:43.915 --> 31:45.974
His crime meets
all the requirements.

31:46.051 --> 31:49.646
Well, the first requirement is that
he have the intent to cause death.

31:49.721 --> 31:53.623
The jury can infer his intent from the
holes he drilled in Ms. Norman's skull.

31:53.692 --> 31:57.458
The only intent that he had
was to keep these women alive,

31:57.529 --> 31:58.621
as companions.

31:58.697 --> 32:01.165
His lawyer is free
to make that argument.

32:01.233 --> 32:04.168
Come on, the jury won't care.
They'll convict on emotion!

32:04.236 --> 32:07.637
His acts were monstrous, but
nobody knows it better than him.

32:07.706 --> 32:10.072
Look, what I saw was a
man that was disgusted,

32:10.141 --> 32:11.938
horrified with himself.

32:12.577 --> 32:15.671
He belongs in prison,
for life, no parole.

32:15.914 --> 32:17.381
But not on death row.

32:19.851 --> 32:24.686
All I need from you is the
evidence to convict Mr. Tagman.

32:25.991 --> 32:28.892
So how do you suggest
we get that evidence?

32:31.096 --> 32:32.996
Try one of your tricks.

32:39.070 --> 32:41.300
I'm with Carver on this.

32:41.373 --> 32:43.273
The guy doesn't
deserve our mercy.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.166
Step into him.

32:54.085 --> 32:56.815
Of all the people to go to bat for.

32:56.888 --> 32:59.356
I know, I know.
It's not the popular choice.

33:03.228 --> 33:04.525
I'll say.

33:21.846 --> 33:25.976
John. You remember
Detective Eames, don't you?

33:27.719 --> 33:28.811
All my client's been told

33:28.887 --> 33:31.048
is that he's charged with
kidnap and aggravated assault.

33:31.122 --> 33:36.116
John, have you ever heard of the
law of unintended consequences?

33:37.996 --> 33:40.362
Well, this is one of those consequences.

33:41.066 --> 33:43.899
After you were picked up
on a mistaken identity,

33:43.968 --> 33:46.402
your name and address
were entered in the system.

33:46.471 --> 33:51.306
Turns out you fit the
geographic profile of the suspect

33:52.043 --> 33:56.173
who attacked the girl who was
found in your neighborhood.

33:56.247 --> 33:57.509
Claire Massey.

33:57.582 --> 33:59.311
She worked a block
from where you work.

33:59.384 --> 34:02.979
She bought chocolates from
your store once a week.

34:03.355 --> 34:04.344
A coincidence.

34:04.422 --> 34:06.720
You ever see her
in your store, John?

34:06.791 --> 34:08.190
Say hello to her?

34:08.259 --> 34:09.987
Don't answer
their questions.

34:10.594 --> 34:13.223
John, I know you
want to be truthful.

34:20.505 --> 34:24.464
I remember seeing her. She was
watching us make chocolates.

34:24.542 --> 34:28.706
No, see, it turns out a couple of
your co-workers saw you talking to her

34:28.780 --> 34:31.943
on the very Friday
Claire disappeared.

34:32.016 --> 34:35.452
They said on
Friday around noon,

34:35.520 --> 34:37.886
you were putting out
a fresh batch of truffles,

34:37.956 --> 34:39.924
Claire came in and you talked to her.

34:39.991 --> 34:41.788
No, that's not right.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.054
I saw her
the Monday before.

34:45.130 --> 34:46.563
I don't know why they're
lying about Friday.

34:46.630 --> 34:51.364
John, they described the
girl as a brunette in a skirt,

34:51.436 --> 34:54.234
with a bruise on her
knee, her left knee.

35:05.817 --> 35:08.547
Your witnesses said the girl
had a bruise on her left knee.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.555
Isn't Ms. Massey's
bruise on her right knee?

35:13.224 --> 35:16.455
Is that what you saw, John?
A bruise on her right knee?

35:16.528 --> 35:18.553
When did you see
this bruise?

35:18.630 --> 35:22.464
Was it Monday when she came in
the store, is that when it was?

35:23.735 --> 35:25.327
Yes, that's when I saw it.

35:25.403 --> 35:27.894
Sounds like your witnesses
saw the wrong girl on Friday.

35:27.972 --> 35:31.635
Sounds more like your client
saw the wrong girl on Monday.

35:31.709 --> 35:35.270
This is a picture of Claire
Massey in the emergency room,

35:35.346 --> 35:37.871
and that's a bruise on her left knee.

35:40.752 --> 35:43.186
No, that can't be true.

35:43.254 --> 35:45.882
It was on the other knee,
the right knee. I saw it.

35:46.524 --> 35:48.287
Well, that's what
it looks like, John.

35:48.359 --> 35:49.917
Looks like a bruise on her left knee.

35:49.994 --> 35:53.452
The writing on that medical
equipment. It's backwards.

35:54.199 --> 35:56.429
This photo's been
printed backwards.

35:58.269 --> 36:00.897
He's right.
It's been reversed.

36:02.106 --> 36:04.939
Well, I guess the bruise is
on her right knee, after all.

36:05.009 --> 36:07.842
So let's get this straight. She
came into your store on Monday

36:07.912 --> 36:11.075
and you saw this
bruise on her knee.

36:12.484 --> 36:14.111
Yes.
Got him.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.984
<i>The witnesses must've
seen the wrong girl after all.</i>

36:18.056 --> 36:22.152
By the way, John, the bruise on
Claire's knee? She didn't have it Monday.

36:22.227 --> 36:24.627
She got it falling off
her treadmill.

36:27.232 --> 36:28.699
On Wednesday.

36:29.567 --> 36:32.434
The only way you could've seen that
bruise is when you brought her home

36:32.504 --> 36:35.302
on Friday night and
took her clothes off.

36:36.241 --> 36:38.766
And since the same drill
that was used on Claire

36:38.843 --> 36:41.311
was also used
on Amanda Norman,

36:41.913 --> 36:46.111
the DA will be adding a new charge
to your indictment for murder.

36:48.553 --> 36:51.420
It's been so nice
doing business with you.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.391
Good work.

37:01.699 --> 37:02.996
What's he doing?

37:03.067 --> 37:04.295
<i>John.</i>

37:04.669 --> 37:06.933
What is he doing?

37:07.005 --> 37:08.336
My client is
done talking.

37:17.115 --> 37:18.742
Don't be scared.

37:26.925 --> 37:32.056
You've done evil things,
but you're not evil.

37:37.135 --> 37:39.797
You know, when the
heart stops beating

37:40.838 --> 37:44.365
and the blood settles in the
body, it makes these marks.

37:44.742 --> 37:49.611
And that's how we can tell what
position a body was in after death.

37:56.487 --> 38:00.480
This is the pattern that
Amanda had on her body.

38:00.992 --> 38:02.016
Don't
respond to this.

38:02.093 --> 38:03.924
You lied next to her.

38:05.863 --> 38:08.297
You held her cuddled in your arms.

38:11.936 --> 38:14.063
And you just held her for hours.

38:16.074 --> 38:18.474
No.

38:18.543 --> 38:22.343
You bathed her.
You dressed her.

38:26.985 --> 38:32.480
You left her like this,
so her body could be found

38:33.558 --> 38:35.822
and her family
could bury her.

38:37.862 --> 38:39.693
You didn't want to hurt
these girls. Detective...

38:39.764 --> 38:41.197
In a minute.

38:43.701 --> 38:46.602
Now, whatever you
meant or didn't mean,

38:48.573 --> 38:50.370
<i>they're now going to
convict you of murder.</i>

38:50.441 --> 38:51.635
<i>Don't let him
scare you.</i>

38:51.976 --> 38:54.911
If they had the evidence, he
wouldn't be here talking to you.

38:54.979 --> 38:59.313
Make no mistake my meaning
for being here, okay?

39:00.318 --> 39:03.116
Do not. Now,
maybe he's right.

39:04.689 --> 39:10.093
Maybe you'll walk out of here a
free man, but you won't be free.

39:11.262 --> 39:13.594
Because you want
what you want.

39:17.568 --> 39:23.302
Someone who won't leave,
who won't judge you.

39:24.909 --> 39:28.777
Someone who will surrender
herself to you. A girlfriend.

39:31.683 --> 39:34.015
Well, this need, it won't stop.

39:34.385 --> 39:36.979
Now, you know that
about yourself, don't you?

39:37.055 --> 39:40.320
I don't... No. No.
I'm not like that.

39:40.391 --> 39:42.450
John, your loneliness
is so deep,

39:46.497 --> 39:48.897
you can't help
but do this again.

39:52.070 --> 39:53.731
Hurt other women.

39:58.443 --> 40:03.676
Commit ever more
depraved acts.

40:12.590 --> 40:14.319
You ate Amanda's flesh.

40:15.026 --> 40:17.221
Yeah, you cooked it
with potatoes and onions.

40:24.669 --> 40:28.537
Because you needed to be connected
to her, to be close to her.

40:30.475 --> 40:33.444
That's what your life
is always going to be like.

40:33.511 --> 40:37.003
You are always going to be
looking for that connection.

40:37.415 --> 40:41.283
Each day
worse than the last.

40:41.352 --> 40:43.013
I know that
you want to stop.

40:46.824 --> 40:49.315
I know you want to be a good person.

40:50.628 --> 40:53.426
I can see it,
because you have remorse.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.131
That's why you drink.

41:00.204 --> 41:01.694
John, take responsibility.

41:01.773 --> 41:03.035
Mr. Tagman,
don't answer him.

41:03.107 --> 41:05.871
This will never stop until
you take responsibility.

41:05.943 --> 41:08.070
Detective,
the interview's over.

41:09.180 --> 41:10.204
She can't even remember

41:10.281 --> 41:12.181
her own name, John.
Detective...

41:12.917 --> 41:14.441
Can't remember.

41:18.089 --> 41:19.613
How many more?

41:26.631 --> 41:28.895
I don't know why I do this.

41:33.037 --> 41:37.133
I want to know why. I
don't want... I'm sorry.

41:38.910 --> 41:43.540
I'm sorry. I... I just wanted someone.

41:44.448 --> 41:45.813
Oh, God.

41:47.385 --> 41:50.013
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't...

41:50.087 --> 41:53.215
What is wrong with me?
Oh, God.

42:01.232 --> 42:04.668
A heartfelt confession. So
much for the death penalty.

42:09.507 --> 42:11.338
I think Tagman's ready
to take a plea, Counselor.

42:11.409 --> 42:13.138
You should get in there.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.415
I hear he volunteered to be a guinea pig

42:24.488 --> 42:26.956
for a study of
the criminal brain.

42:27.024 --> 42:31.552
Someone should study how one man
can shed so many crocodile tears.

42:31.996 --> 42:35.693
Well, he's in prison
for life, no parole.

42:35.766 --> 42:37.131
He's not going to
hurt anyone else.

42:41.706 --> 42:47.008
Yeah. When?
All right, thank you.

42:57.388 --> 42:59.481
Mr. Tagman was beaten to death

42:59.557 --> 43:01.957
by another inmate this
morning at Sing Sing.

43:02.894 --> 43:06.159
He was in the laundry
working when he was attacked.

43:08.532 --> 43:11.330
I guess now everybody
has what they want.
