<i>Previously on "Smallville"...</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:04.675
- Who are you?
- Lois Lane.

00:04.698 --> 00:06.434
I think we're
going to enjoy

00:06.460 --> 00:09.248
a long and fruitful
partnership, Ms. Sullivan

00:09.263 --> 00:11.865
I need your help, your
father murdered his parents.

00:11.881 --> 00:12.934
There is no proof.

00:12.949 --> 00:15.784
Only the voice mail confession
of Lionel Luthor himself.

00:15.785 --> 00:17.397
- I'm leaving.
- Paris?

00:17.473 --> 00:19.611
<i>Lionel Luthor, you're
under arrest for murder.</i>

00:19.636 --> 00:21.287
Clark Kent is dead.

00:27.585 --> 00:30.715
<i>I don't believe that safe house's
explosion was an accident.</i>

00:30.730 --> 00:35.290
She's dead as a result of her own actions,
I had nothing to do with it.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.390
I promise I will find who did this to you.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.805
You're not the
only one who misses her.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.755
Just the only one
doing something about it.

00:41.321 --> 00:43.780
Lois? Chloe's still alive.

00:46.859 --> 00:49.199
<i>I know you find it hard to believe,
but trust me,</i>

00:49.311 --> 00:51.065
Chloe's not buried in that grave.

00:51.356 --> 00:53.025
How do you know that?

00:53.122 --> 00:55.360
Look, I want her back more
than anyone, but don't you

00:55.386 --> 00:57.598
think your hunch is a rung
on the whole grief ladder?

00:57.618 --> 00:59.752
None of this would've happened
if I had been there.

00:59.984 --> 01:02.789
Okay, commando, I don't get you.
Half the time

01:02.803 --> 01:05.173
you're all meek and
"yes, ma," "yes, pa."

01:05.178 --> 01:08.903
And the other half, you are the most
over confident guy I've ever met.

01:08.928 --> 01:10.533
It doesn't happen to
you much, does it...

01:10.555 --> 01:12.468
not being able to peg
someone right away?

01:13.917 --> 01:17.232
Oh, get over yourself.
You are not that complicated.

01:18.126 --> 01:19.892
This is Chloe's safe house?

01:20.117 --> 01:21.653
You mean, what's left of it?

01:26.159 --> 01:27.714
Oh, my god. Chloe...

01:29.057 --> 01:30.621
what did they do to you?

01:35.819 --> 01:38.547
What exactly do you expect to find here?

01:38.688 --> 01:41.040
I don't know, but
the FBI sealed the case,

01:41.143 --> 01:42.977
even the autopsy reports.

01:43.695 --> 01:46.014
Doesn't that sound a little odd?

01:47.451 --> 01:50.160
Remind me if I'm ever a witness,

01:50.302 --> 01:53.542
not to put my life in the hands of the FBI.

01:54.506 --> 01:56.638
Well, maybe she got out
before the explosion.

01:57.906 --> 02:00.374
They said she walked inside, Clark.

02:00.407 --> 02:03.303
I don't know how
anyone could survive this.

02:04.505 --> 02:06.920
Look, you may be in denial,
thinking Chloe's alive.

02:06.946 --> 02:09.220
But I'm gonna find out
who did this to her.

02:12.603 --> 02:16.256
Let's get outta here, Clark.
This place gives me the creeps.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.397
Well, don't just stand there.
Come on.

04:11.634 --> 04:14.830
- We lost them.
- Find them!

Original Airdate Sept. 22, 2004

05:24.720 --> 05:29.097
Nothing like a little north by northwest
action to get the blood pumping, huh?

05:32.742 --> 05:33.987
Um...

05:34.900 --> 05:36.670
we usually take turns in the bathroom.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.753
Oh, don't start with me, Smallville.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.945
You're the one taking the marathon shower.

05:40.989 --> 05:43.454
Besides, my delicate feminine sensibilities

05:43.483 --> 05:46.029
weren't offended the first time
I got a glimpse of, uh,

05:46.132 --> 05:47.937
Clark junior.

05:49.669 --> 05:52.395
My parents kinda missed
the whole Woodstock phase.

05:52.438 --> 05:55.712
Besides, they freaked out the last
time they caught me in a...

05:55.771 --> 05:57.415
co-ed situation.

05:57.533 --> 05:59.162
Last time?

05:59.527 --> 06:03.419
So the eagle scout does have
a few secrets in the closet.

06:05.923 --> 06:07.800
Just forget it, all right?

06:08.955 --> 06:10.293
That's my shirt.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.840
It's the only thing I could find that was clean.

06:14.413 --> 06:19.424
Hey... let's keep this morning's game
of chopper tag... a secret, okay?

06:19.730 --> 06:20.661
Right.

06:20.706 --> 06:24.315
Because I'm the one who can't keep my mouth shut.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.691
Mom.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.738
Hi.

06:27.812 --> 06:29.136
You're home.

06:31.551 --> 06:33.341
Hi, Mrs. Kent.

07:29.097 --> 07:32.228
I don't understand what the big deal
is here. We just took a shower.

07:32.272 --> 07:34.469
Showers. We took separate showers.

07:34.485 --> 07:35.838
At noon?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.948
- We were just gonna...
- We went to Chloe's safe house.

07:44.751 --> 07:48.357
These guys showed up and chased us
into a field, and there was all this dirt.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.537
Clark,

07:50.439 --> 07:52.680
that is a federal crime scene.

07:54.310 --> 07:58.453
And the last thing that we want is for you
two kids to get involved with the FBI.

07:58.497 --> 08:00.902
Whoever it was, we don't
need to worry, because their chopper

08:00.905 --> 08:03.530
is face-first in the middle of the field.

08:12.805 --> 08:15.934
Your non-verbals are killing me, and

08:16.037 --> 08:18.743
this seems like it's a family matter, so...

08:19.387 --> 08:21.322
I'm just gonna get outta the way.

08:21.890 --> 08:23.185
Way to go.

08:32.802 --> 08:37.619
Please tell me that you did
not crash that helicopter.

08:46.008 --> 08:48.511
Waste of a new suit, isn't it, dad?

08:48.672 --> 08:50.889
Well, I don't think so, son.

08:51.545 --> 08:54.994
Even if miss Sullivan were alive
and testified against me,

08:55.043 --> 08:59.205
you and I both know the jury
would still find me not guilty.

09:01.404 --> 09:03.528
But I am sorry, Lex.

09:03.761 --> 09:05.932
Sorry that you killed
a bright young woman

09:05.958 --> 09:07.750
just because she
stood in your way?

09:07.794 --> 09:10.384
My apology concerns you and me.

09:10.428 --> 09:11.432
I'm...

09:11.636 --> 09:14.357
sorry that you couldn't
foresee the consequences

09:14.383 --> 09:16.467
of your actions when
you betrayed me.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.811
You can save the threats, dad.
I'm not

09:18.837 --> 09:21.230
as easy a target as
you seem to think.

09:24.236 --> 09:26.026
All those tests...

09:26.099 --> 09:29.097
all those trials that made you strong.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.599
But this time, it's different.

09:34.254 --> 09:39.144
You'll never know when
it will happen, but it will happen.

09:39.393 --> 09:43.436
Each swallow of wine you take,

09:43.989 --> 09:46.885
every key you turn, every...

09:47.568 --> 09:50.581
friend you make...

09:52.030 --> 09:55.129
you'll never have
another moment's peace.

10:26.861 --> 10:28.374
You look great.

10:28.418 --> 10:30.091
Thank you.

10:30.311 --> 10:31.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:36.225 --> 10:38.265
So, from your message,
I didn't quite get if

10:38.275 --> 10:40.430
this is a stopover or if
you're back for good.

10:40.455 --> 10:42.172
For a while.

10:42.195 --> 10:44.451
I guess Paris just wasn't for me.

10:45.615 --> 10:46.814
Yeah.

10:47.731 --> 10:48.983
Museums,

10:49.012 --> 10:51.637
late night jazz clubs,
walks along the seine...

10:51.663 --> 10:53.795
I can see how that
can all get boring.

10:53.946 --> 10:56.222
Let's just say that

10:56.382 --> 10:59.438
I felt as though something was calling me home.

10:59.817 --> 11:02.116
A little cryptic, but I'll take it.

11:02.714 --> 11:05.248
Well, you picked a good day for home coming.

11:06.325 --> 11:08.813
You know, Clark just resurfaced, too.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.705
Interesting timing.

11:10.851 --> 11:13.703
Funny. I don't remember asking about Clark.

11:14.592 --> 11:18.769
Actually, um, I came by because
I saw the talon was boarded up.

11:18.813 --> 11:20.471
I thought you would've sold it by now.

11:20.516 --> 11:22.020
Yeah, well,

11:22.065 --> 11:24.655
I had a little trouble letting it go.

11:26.810 --> 11:29.269
Why, are you in the market for a partner?

11:30.032 --> 11:31.205
No.

11:31.245 --> 11:32.245
Um...

11:32.253 --> 11:35.556
no, I want to rent the apartment.

12:32.827 --> 12:34.717
I hope that Clark is right.
Otherwise,

12:34.720 --> 12:36.689
this is gonna be
really ugly, Chloe.

12:41.492 --> 12:42.380
Okay.

13:15.585 --> 13:17.797
He was right.

13:26.713 --> 13:28.575
Where's Chloe Sullivan?

13:28.881 --> 13:32.272
- Who the hell are you?
- You'd better tell me where she is.

13:40.967 --> 13:42.233
What...

13:42.816 --> 13:46.489
the posse couldn't get to me
the first time, so the boss sent you?

13:47.231 --> 13:49.355
You can both kiss my ass.

14:11.949 --> 14:13.419
Are you okay?

14:20.056 --> 14:22.006
Where the hell did he go?

14:24.513 --> 14:26.784
Medieval psychopath.

14:27.426 --> 14:31.081
Guess you'd have to be in order to dig up
a grave in the middle of the day.

14:33.115 --> 14:35.522
Actually... that was me.

14:36.677 --> 14:38.787
It's my cousin's grave.

14:41.102 --> 14:42.629
Lois Lane.

14:46.811 --> 14:48.455
Lana Lang.

15:10.860 --> 15:11.936
Lana.

15:12.873 --> 15:14.081
You're back.

15:14.106 --> 15:15.997
Hi. Hi, Clark.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.650
Lois.

15:22.362 --> 15:23.881
How did you two...?

15:24.260 --> 15:25.701
We just met.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.916
I stopped by the cemetery
to pay my respects to Chloe.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.973
I think you're forgetting about
the part where you saved my life.

15:32.363 --> 15:35.899
Some Ginsu boy came after us at Chloe's grave.

15:36.394 --> 15:41.254
Look, Clark, if you really think that
Chloe's alive, I... I want to help find her.

15:41.619 --> 15:43.337
Uh, Lana...

15:43.847 --> 15:47.193
look, I don't want to get your hopes up,
but we don't know anything for sure.

15:48.868 --> 15:50.105
Okay.

15:53.278 --> 15:55.620
You're back from Paris. You must've
found what you were looking for.

15:55.649 --> 15:56.844
I'll say.

15:56.873 --> 16:01.021
Who wouldn't want a hot summer fling
in the most romantic city on earth?

16:04.034 --> 16:05.692
I was going to tell you.

16:07.681 --> 16:09.005
It's okay.

16:10.518 --> 16:11.755
Really?

16:11.814 --> 16:12.905
You two.

16:12.935 --> 16:14.629
- We never...
- Not really...

16:14.673 --> 16:17.283
- Had a thing...
- It's complicated...

16:18.360 --> 16:19.719
A complicated thing.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.175
Never mind.

16:27.724 --> 16:28.950
Well, um,

16:29.212 --> 16:31.307
I'm gonna go.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.663
The awkward tension is just getting started.

16:44.692 --> 16:46.831
I really crashed and burned on that one.

16:46.977 --> 16:48.985
Must be a daily ritual for you.

16:49.961 --> 16:52.653
Only when I'm barreling into a train wreck.

17:04.021 --> 17:06.483
Listen to me... I really think
we're onto something here

17:06.510 --> 17:10.308
I did my research.
Luthorcorp paid for the funeral.

17:10.344 --> 17:13.094
Why would they do that?
It doesn't make any sens.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.751
I guess the real question to ask would be,

17:16.970 --> 17:20.353
well, why would somebody bury
an empty casket for nothing,

17:20.407 --> 17:21.844
right, Clark?

17:23.592 --> 17:24.720
Clark?

17:29.084 --> 17:30.175
Wow,

17:30.230 --> 17:32.777
she didn't take any prisoners, did she?

17:35.051 --> 17:36.179
Lana...

17:36.252 --> 17:37.779
cute, smart.

17:37.842 --> 17:39.206
Gutsy.

17:39.716 --> 17:42.844
And way too much for you to handle.
I can see why you're in love with her.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.919
Look, you're really not the person
I want to talk to about this.

17:46.628 --> 17:48.181
Suit yourself.

17:55.097 --> 17:56.533
It's just...

17:58.244 --> 17:59.966
I knew she'd be dating other people.

18:00.002 --> 18:01.038
But...

18:05.278 --> 18:07.152
I just don't understand how you could

18:07.188 --> 18:08.989
feel like you know someone

18:09.069 --> 18:11.025
so completely, like
you know everything

18:11.035 --> 18:12.680
about them, and then
just, all of a sudden

18:12.685 --> 18:14.531
you don't even know
what continent they're on.

18:14.581 --> 18:16.599
Do you always have to
finish people's thoughts?

18:16.637 --> 18:18.309
Well, am I right?

18:30.862 --> 18:32.098
Come on!

18:32.506 --> 18:34.033
We gotta go!

18:44.804 --> 18:46.339
Hi, daddy.

18:54.794 --> 18:57.068
I thought we had an understanding.

18:57.123 --> 18:59.950
You were to stay away from that crime scene.

18:59.986 --> 19:02.387
And you were supposed to beat the pentagon.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.607
They sent me out to fort Ryan
to oversee some maneuvers.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.826
To keep an eye on me,
is that it, boss?

19:07.845 --> 19:09.180
Drop it, lo.

19:09.308 --> 19:10.436
Why?

19:10.509 --> 19:12.664
I'm obviously on to something here.
You wouldn't

19:12.684 --> 19:15.336
be calling out the birds
if I was late for dinner.

19:21.655 --> 19:23.347
You didn't seriously invite him to dinner.

19:23.384 --> 19:26.075
Clark, Mr. Lane is a three-star general.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.277
I think he deserves a little respect.

19:28.296 --> 19:29.277
Mom,

19:29.478 --> 19:30.478
mom..

19:31.570 --> 19:34.681
This is some place you got here,
Mr. and Mrs. Kent.

19:35.109 --> 19:39.365
And again, I'd like to thank you
for keeping an eye on my little lo.

19:40.058 --> 19:41.913
Can I offer you a Chabelo?

19:41.967 --> 19:44.787
Hand-rolled with some of the
finest tobacco in the U.S. Of A.

19:47.244 --> 19:48.844
No, I, uh,

19:48.917 --> 19:51.536
my heart isn't exactly what it used to be.

19:51.810 --> 19:55.684
I'm gonna have to take a rain check
on your hospitality, Mrs. Kent.

19:55.721 --> 19:58.213
- You're welcome anytime.
- Well, thank you.

19:58.396 --> 20:00.386
Let's double-time it, lo.

20:05.825 --> 20:08.081
This is about Chloe.

20:08.154 --> 20:10.809
Clark, find the Luthorcorp connection.

20:13.488 --> 20:15.124
Good night now.

20:15.216 --> 20:16.435
Good night.

20:24.853 --> 20:28.982
I was assigned to the accident
in Jakarta and the shuttle disaster.

20:29.273 --> 20:30.474
Impressive.

20:31.038 --> 20:35.967
Then maybe you could help explain to me
how a door rips off a jet at 20,000 feet.

20:36.023 --> 20:38.587
We found no traces of explosive residue.

20:38.643 --> 20:42.458
Now, all evidence suggests that the door
was extricated from outside the aircraft...

20:42.513 --> 20:44.131
by manual force.

20:44.750 --> 20:48.789
I'm sorry. Are you trying to tell me
someone did this from outside my plane?

20:55.501 --> 20:58.557
Agent Stocker, will you excuse us?

21:05.288 --> 21:07.627
Does this mean you're talking to me again?

21:07.682 --> 21:09.974
Only because I don't have a choice.

21:10.428 --> 21:13.484
Relegated from friend to last resort.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.686
I guess I'll have to accept it if
it's my only chance to prove myself.

21:17.797 --> 21:18.815
Good.

21:18.896 --> 21:21.152
Cause I want you to help me find Chloe.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.735
Look, I'd like to set things
straight between us, Clark, but

21:24.826 --> 21:28.646
don't you think raising someone from
the grave is setting the bar a little high?

21:28.756 --> 21:31.393
Lex, Chloe's not in her grave.

21:34.679 --> 21:37.590
She was the linchpin in your father's trial.

21:38.244 --> 21:41.846
You would've had investigators
crawling all over that area.

21:43.993 --> 21:45.448
What did they find?

21:46.452 --> 21:51.509
I pulled some strings and asked the FBI
not to release all the morbid details.

21:52.255 --> 21:54.966
The fact is, that explosion
took out an entire acre,

21:54.975 --> 21:58.310
and the reason Chloe's
casket is empty is...

21:59.273 --> 22:01.437
it's because there wasn't anything left.

22:11.051 --> 22:12.687
I'm sorry, Clark.

23:57.405 --> 23:59.760
Considering your father has a yard
full of tanks out there,

23:59.800 --> 24:02.579
I don't think you should be in his office,
rifling through his files.

24:03.706 --> 24:06.361
That didn't seem to slow you down any.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.516
I gotta say, I'm impressed, Smallville,

24:08.571 --> 24:11.317
that you could sneak on
a military base undetected.

24:11.355 --> 24:12.791
What are you doing here?

24:12.827 --> 24:14.409
I'm looking for you.

24:14.501 --> 24:17.011
I think your father's working with Lex Luthor.

24:17.357 --> 24:19.376
I saw one of his cigars in his library.

24:19.413 --> 24:21.530
I knew it. You were right.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.804
Who knew?

24:22.877 --> 24:25.914
My dad and the king of the trust fund kids.

24:26.024 --> 24:28.116
They are trying to cover up
something to do with Chloe.

24:28.171 --> 24:30.518
- And if he finds us here...
- I can handle him, Clark.

24:30.699 --> 24:33.474
Besides, if you think that
chopper recital was something,

24:33.511 --> 24:36.130
you should've seen the escort I had for prom.

24:37.623 --> 24:40.405
Wow, and I thought my father was overprotective.

24:43.589 --> 24:46.393
I guess when he lost my mom,
he kinda cracked and...

24:46.448 --> 24:49.157
ever since, he's been scared of losing me, too.

24:53.652 --> 24:57.872
I can actually talk about her.
She died when I was 6.

24:59.510 --> 25:00.798
I'm sorry.

25:00.979 --> 25:02.198
Don't be.

25:02.726 --> 25:04.361
Unless you're the one
that got her hooked

25:04.375 --> 25:06.676
on cigarettes behind the
gym during high school.

25:10.299 --> 25:12.499
Make yourself useful.

25:24.311 --> 25:26.112
Nellie Blye?

25:26.440 --> 25:28.094
I know.

25:28.804 --> 25:32.124
Can you believe, after 15 years,
my dad is finally getting some action?

25:32.169 --> 25:34.297
I'm kinda happy for the old geezer.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.379
She died nearly 80 years ago.

25:36.508 --> 25:40.356
But it says in his calendar
that he's been taking r&r with her

25:40.410 --> 25:42.175
at least once a week.

25:42.302 --> 25:45.062
She was one of the first
female undercover reporters.

25:45.118 --> 25:47.100
She was Chloe's hero.

25:51.722 --> 25:55.014
It says here that she is at...

25:55.778 --> 25:58.513
2348 Walnut Street.

26:04.482 --> 26:05.518
Clark?

26:22.888 --> 26:24.379
Chloe?

27:04.847 --> 27:06.721
You were right, Mr. Luthor.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.759
Lex's men led me right to the Sullivan chick.

27:10.905 --> 27:13.579
It's done? You did what I asked?

27:13.689 --> 27:14.670
No.

27:15.017 --> 27:16.774
I've kinda had a change of heart.

27:16.810 --> 27:18.901
I had to kill two men.

27:19.229 --> 27:20.666
The price is doubled.

27:21.249 --> 27:24.633
That was a very foolish decision, Trent.

27:24.749 --> 27:27.895
Yes, you have an extraordinary gift.

27:27.951 --> 27:29.533
I know that.

27:30.116 --> 27:34.646
But wasn't it your pride in that gift
that first landed you in Belle Reve?

27:34.700 --> 27:37.611
Don't think you understand! You don't.

27:38.330 --> 27:39.748
Believe me,

27:39.786 --> 27:41.041
I..

27:41.787 --> 27:45.498
Couldn't begin to imagine what
it must've been like for you.

27:45.935 --> 27:47.517
But, Trent,

27:47.645 --> 27:50.690
very few people in your life

27:50.745 --> 27:54.329
will ever accept you for the man you are.

27:54.511 --> 27:58.476
Why would you turn against
the one person who would never,

27:58.666 --> 28:01.085
never judge you?

28:02.904 --> 28:04.614
I don't care.

28:05.815 --> 28:07.851
Then you do care.

28:10.654 --> 28:13.751
It's what you want, Trent...

28:14.007 --> 28:16.007
to be normal.

28:16.135 --> 28:17.753
Isn't it?

28:19.956 --> 28:22.065
Now, I want to help.

28:22.812 --> 28:24.649
But I can't.

28:25.111 --> 28:27.130
I won't be free.

28:28.204 --> 28:32.134
Not if Chloe Sullivan testifies tomorrow.

28:38.322 --> 28:40.834
How long does it take to locate her?

28:41.416 --> 28:42.889
Well, do it.

28:44.032 --> 28:45.632
Clark, I was trying to protect her.

28:45.688 --> 28:47.532
You had a tracking
bracelet on her wrist.

28:47.758 --> 28:49.658
You couldn't have thought
she was that safe.

28:49.668 --> 28:52.222
I tried to take every precaution.

28:52.896 --> 28:56.206
You looked me straight in the eye
and told me she was dead.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.936
Look, sometimes you have to do the
right thing, no matter what the cost.

29:01.344 --> 29:03.163
Even if that cost is Chloe's life.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.456
Clark, if it wasn't for me, Chloe
would've died in that explosion.

29:06.493 --> 29:10.623
I felt responsible for Chloe so
I had investigators watching her.

29:11.023 --> 29:13.751
They found a detonating
device in the safe house,

29:13.798 --> 29:17.854
my father had hired someone to make sure
that Chloe never made it to that witness stand.

29:18.072 --> 29:20.673
I only thing I could do was beat him to it.

29:21.038 --> 29:24.385
The house was built on tunnels
left from the underground rail road.

29:24.713 --> 29:28.445
Seconds after Chloe and her dad entered,
we rushed them underneath the house.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.793
The explosion was rigged to cave
in the tunnel behind them.

29:33.576 --> 29:35.522
The cops never found it.

29:35.723 --> 29:37.341
And Sam Lane?

29:37.724 --> 29:39.659
I didn't trust the FBI.

29:39.715 --> 29:42.443
I needed someone who could
engineer the rescue.

29:43.862 --> 29:46.062
She's at the old foundry.

29:46.301 --> 29:47.537
Don't worry, Clark.

29:47.592 --> 29:50.211
I'll have people over there in minutes.

29:50.269 --> 29:52.070
Get me general Lane.

31:44.704 --> 31:46.450
What the hell is that?

31:51.580 --> 31:54.243
Chloe always told me this town is weird.

31:54.605 --> 31:57.552
I don't know how you ever
survived without me.

32:01.933 --> 32:03.508
How did you get here, anyway?

32:03.563 --> 32:06.273
What do you mean, how did I get
here? How did you get here?

32:06.311 --> 32:07.620
Chloe!

32:08.784 --> 32:11.276
Chloe, are you okay? Chloe?

32:12.041 --> 32:13.496
Chloe.

32:14.351 --> 32:16.443
I was afraid I'd lost you.

32:28.782 --> 32:29.873
Lois?

32:30.474 --> 32:32.682
Lois, what are you doing here?

32:32.737 --> 32:33.938
Lois!

32:35.229 --> 32:38.212
Putting the worst two months
of my life behind me.

32:43.408 --> 32:46.118
Oh, my god. I am so glad I found you.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.483
I...?

32:50.685 --> 32:53.886
If you guys don't mind,
I'd really like to get outta here.

32:53.942 --> 32:54.876
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.060
Let's get you outta here,

32:57.206 --> 33:00.207
Before Lionel throws
any more freaks at you.

33:00.298 --> 33:05.310
Because tomorrow morning in court,
I am gonna kick Lionel Luthor's butt.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.923
"Guilty!"

33:11.924 --> 33:15.230
"Jury returns verdict
in high profile case."

33:15.255 --> 33:16.855
it's good to see that
there's some things

33:16.860 --> 33:18.822
even Lionel Luthor can't
buy his way out of.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.598
Thanks to Chloe.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.144
Clark,

33:22.181 --> 33:23.873
as much as I hate to admit this,

33:23.910 --> 33:25.656
Lex had a hand in it, too.

33:25.747 --> 33:28.002
He did make good on
his promise to protect Chloe.

33:28.039 --> 33:31.247
And look what he got out of it
control of Luthorcorp.

33:33.605 --> 33:35.446
Look, I'm sorry, but it's
gonna take a lot more

33:35.468 --> 33:37.148
than that for me to get
to trust him again.

33:37.161 --> 33:40.836
Ever since he met you, he's been
surrounded by things he can't explain.

33:40.872 --> 33:43.629
We can't really blame him
for trying to find the truth.

33:43.702 --> 33:46.831
The truth is, he's been
lying to me from day one.

33:47.777 --> 33:51.161
The legend on the cave wall says
I'm destined to have an enemy.

33:53.342 --> 33:55.852
All this time, I've been worried about Lionel.

33:55.907 --> 33:59.254
But I'm beginning to think that the
real threat was right in front of me.

34:00.310 --> 34:02.202
I think it's Lex.

34:15.496 --> 34:16.824
Lana.

34:20.063 --> 34:22.061
What are you doing down here?

34:22.716 --> 34:25.027
Probably the same thing you are.

34:28.301 --> 34:29.920
It's peaceful.

34:32.031 --> 34:33.723
You're 2 for 2.

34:35.259 --> 34:38.460
You keep showing up when
I least expect to see you.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.626
I'm not trying to surprise you, Clark.

34:41.844 --> 34:45.701
I know. It's just when you left, I...
wasn't sure when I'd see you again.

34:47.697 --> 34:49.408
It's funny, isn't it?

34:52.318 --> 34:55.120
After everything we've been through,

34:56.721 --> 34:59.668
I thought it would take us longer to get over it.

35:00.596 --> 35:02.113
Us?

35:03.478 --> 35:05.260
You and Lois.

35:05.534 --> 35:07.061
Lois?

35:09.518 --> 35:11.882
She's bossy.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.038
She's stuck-up, she's rude.

35:18.111 --> 35:19.857
I can't stand her.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.987
The best ones always start that way.

35:36.282 --> 35:38.592
Do you believe in destiny?

35:41.869 --> 35:43.706
I don't want to.

35:44.979 --> 35:47.308
But you can't escape it, can you,

35:48.091 --> 35:50.419
even if you don't know what it is yet?

35:52.638 --> 35:55.021
Lana, what is it you're not telling me?

35:56.003 --> 35:58.241
Does it have something
to do with this guy you met?

35:58.295 --> 36:02.225
No, no.
Um, no, it doesn't.

36:02.970 --> 36:06.081
But I'm sorry that you
found out the way you did.

36:07.864 --> 36:09.584
I should go.

36:40.610 --> 36:42.393
Well done, Lex.

36:44.685 --> 36:47.130
But wasn't it you who warned me,

36:47.166 --> 36:50.641
don't wound what you cannot kill?

37:00.610 --> 37:04.175
Oh, and, dad...

37:06.723 --> 37:09.633
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

37:52.934 --> 37:54.007
Hi.

37:58.447 --> 38:01.601
I'm freaking you out with the whole
Cary Grant moment, aren't I?

38:06.427 --> 38:08.639
What are you doing here?

38:09.717 --> 38:11.550
Giving you time.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.641
They're beautiful.

38:27.103 --> 38:29.377
I, uh, found this.

38:33.707 --> 38:37.333
"Jason, I had to go back home.
I wish I had time to explain."

38:37.745 --> 38:39.604
So now you do.

38:45.644 --> 38:48.379
I'm sorry, Jason. I, uh...

38:50.889 --> 38:52.757
I don't know what to say.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.647
It's okay.

38:58.137 --> 38:59.286
It's all right.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.593
You know, I kept trying to convince
myself that this wasn't about me, but...

39:05.933 --> 39:08.712
you can't really put that in a note, can you?

39:18.271 --> 39:19.624
Wait.

39:23.031 --> 39:25.932
Jason, I'm not sorry to see you.

39:26.908 --> 39:28.115
You know, it's just...

39:28.217 --> 39:30.822
you came all this way, and I just... I wish...

39:30.866 --> 39:33.316
that I had a better explanation for you

39:33.870 --> 39:36.795
for why you left Paris
or why you left me?

39:36.854 --> 39:39.080
You know how I feel about you.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.153
That hasn't changed.

39:46.982 --> 39:48.975
But I can't go back.

39:50.999 --> 39:53.664
Lana, I didn't come here to get you.

39:55.805 --> 39:58.249
I came here to be with you.
