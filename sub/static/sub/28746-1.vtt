Thank you.
Well, are we keeping the schedule?

"Mr. Eber seed, I assure you ..."
Just a moment. It's kids.

02:03.321 --> 02:07.401
- Yes, and you're an interpreter, right?
- Yes, but you can't.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.920
It is quite common in Thailand,
that children work.

02:11.121 --> 02:13.281
Well, you don't.

02:13.441 --> 02:15.921
If I don't, do another one.

02:16.081 --> 02:19.401
And don't you interpret me,
another will make the money.

That you can keep it warm.
Can you get something to drink?

02:46.201 --> 02:49.120
"As you can see,
is everything under control..."

02:49.280 --> 02:51.520
Shit, man.

Good boy.
<i>To the airport, please.</i>

05:48.920 --> 05:53.680
Leif, do we have more real bosses?
The kinøyserils taste of fox piss.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.880
I know what I'm talking about
from my time as a forest runner.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.560
Leif?

06:02.800 --> 06:07.280
Haløjsa. A blind passenger?

06:09.721 --> 06:12.560
What are you? What?

I put some free sponsor
toothpaste on, and <i>so</i> I just brush.

06:38.641 --> 06:43.160
I start at the back of my mouth
and get well in the hook...

06:43.321 --> 06:46.640
- Hey, Laske.
- Sune, do you want to go out?

06:46.801 --> 06:50.480
- Unfortunately, it is now.
- Sune, honestly...

06:50.641 --> 06:55.120
You have the first birthday on Saturday,

- Good morning, Ash.
- Good morning, Jorn.

07:23.761 --> 07:27.361
Siren, I borrowed your dankort.
I couldn't find my purse.

We didn't agree
porridge in everyday life?

07:30.481 --> 07:36.640
Yes, but it's a bit too much for Sune.
New home, new family, new eating habits.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.440
Then of course you have to
Also like to take, Ash.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.480
I've only bought four,
But yes, please.

- You've washed your hands, right?
- Well. There is no soap.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.800
- It is in the starfish.
- The slick gray grin?

08:00.960 --> 08:04.080
Yes, it is without parabens

08:04.280 --> 08:08.080
But you might wash
Not even hands, Jorn?

08:19.680 --> 08:23.040
You never know

Sune ridiculously laughs.

Fuck off! You have something
sitting on your glasses.

Write "child friendly".

09:26.560 --> 09:31.320

10:43.240 --> 10:46.080
- I have a birthday on Saturday.
- Without us?

10:46.240 --> 10:50.320
For the family. You should not wish you

- Shit, so better drink gasoline.
- But my uncle Stewart is coming.

You just get baby Dorit back, Terkel.
Mother must have a half Look Light.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.160

11:37.120 --> 11:40.080
It's hot today, huh?
You get completely dry in your neck.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.440
There is organic iced tea
with rose hips and sea buckthorn.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.920
Then we are no longer talking about it.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.480
Actually, I actually have
a little gift for...

11:49.640 --> 11:54.320
There is also one for Sune. There shall
do not make a difference <i>on</i> the boys.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.480
That's already quite big
difference between them, so purely phygic.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.760
- A rock flower?
- Yes, can you remember them?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.120
Nah.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.520
Grandma, we are going to dance samba!

12:07.680 --> 12:10.520
Yes, it's not bad.

12:10.680 --> 12:15.520

- Well-known, Fnuggi.

12:15.680 --> 12:20.200
- Do I have to go up and play now?
- No, play a little on your iPad.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.720
I also have a gift.
To Aske, who has a birthday.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.400

13:02.160 --> 13:05.400
It was good, Terkel.
Harlequin as bz's?

13:05.560 --> 13:09.920
- That's the way a checkered ninja is.
- I've never seen them checked.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.960
That's what makes it so rare.
And expensive. Well, it was expensive.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.280
Just getting it out of Thailand
was a shudder because of the sword.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.520
Danny, my big boy, was five years old
in Thai prison for 10 grams of cocaine.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.280
- 10 grams?
- Just for your own consumption.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.080
Ashes, write that behind the ear.

13:32.240 --> 13:36.240
Prison in Thailand, that's something
There is one to be desired, one was dead.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.440
- Okay.
- Speaking of death...

13:38.600 --> 13:42.159
- What the hell are they in here?
- They're completely without wheat.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.600
You might well say that.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.720
John, how's the business going?
It was something with nuts.

13:48.879 --> 13:51.800
Kastanjelaveriet.dk.
We are not talking about that.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.680

- Dot dk.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.000
- But it didn't.
- Well, didn't it?

13:59.160 --> 14:02.840
I'm going to make chestnuts
In a moment, Jonas.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.600
That's just fine,
that Jorn has some initiatives.

14:06.759 --> 14:10.599
And as long as you are happy to pay
for all his potteries.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.920

14:17.360 --> 14:20.000
Yes, yes, I have to go home anyway.

<i>Scared Gaa Dai Lai Lean</i>

Sesamfro!

14:39.120 --> 14:43.200
- A checkered ninja?
- Yes, it's the mega-debt.

14:43.359 --> 14:45.840
- Ninjas are black.
- In fact, they used indigo blades.

14:45.999 --> 14:48.840
But only on missions.
In reality...

14:48.999 --> 14:50.720
Jesus...

14:50.880 --> 14:53.360
Are you going to party? Here you go.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.720

You may take a friend with you.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.600
- A friend each?
- Noh, no, a friend to share.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.560
- What do you think?
- Yes, what is it you think?

15:05.880 --> 15:09.840
- Didn't I have to see it?
- Yes, but I...

15:09.999 --> 15:14.240
Is that Jessica? Why are you leaving
Don't go talk to her?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.719
Should I get her over here?
Jessica!

15:16.880 --> 15:21.039
Jessica, just try and come.
Ash must ask you something.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.719
- Ash wants to ask for something.
- What?

15:25.880 --> 15:29.160
Oh, ooh, ohm...

15:32.079 --> 15:36.279
What then, Mulle?
So you? He has no eyes.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.640
- Idiot!
- What did you say?

15:38.799 --> 15:41.799
- Uh, I said...
- Give me that.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.319
Glenn, honestly. Give me them.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.000
I'm just gonna see the mole.
Can I see your paws?

15:49.040 --> 15:53.559
Then stop, yours
fat idiot, or I'll smash you!

15:54.879 --> 15:57.800
I do not think so,
I heard that one.

16:05.559 --> 16:08.880
- What's the problem, Glenn?
- He's just for...

16:09.039 --> 16:12.840
- There's no problem.
- Get rid of it. Also you two.

16:12.999 --> 16:15.000
Shit Unger.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.920
- Thank you, Ash.
- I did not say anything.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.960
"Or I'll smash you."
You're not sorry.

16:25.119 --> 16:28.640
- But it wasn't...
- Sure enough, Ash.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.719
Uh, yeah, right?

16:31.880 --> 16:36.279
So, he must not step down the enemy
on my friends. I do not want to do that.

16:42.159 --> 16:44.840
- See you, Ash.
- Yes, we are seen.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.440
Hello?

16:52.599 --> 16:55.080
Say something. Say something.

16:55.239 --> 16:58.680
- What should I say?
- Hi, Glenn.

16:58.839 --> 17:03.560
So you want to smash me?
And I'm a fat idiot?

17:03.720 --> 17:06.159
Yes. Or no.
I didn't say that.

17:06.319 --> 17:10.280
If you say anything about me again,
Then I break your nose <i>on</i> you.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.319
- Do you understand?
- One hundred percent.

17:13.479 --> 17:16.839
Fuck off with you.

He's right behind you. Step on.

17:43.239 --> 17:46.440
- You can't talk!
- I'll probably decide for myself.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.040
Come on, bumsefjæsa! Faster!

17:50.199 --> 17:52.479
- Stop it. Pardon!

17:52.640 --> 17:55.920
- And you're ugly!
- No you are not!

17:58.599 --> 18:03.000
- What the hell is going on?
- You will be killed a little.

18:03.159 --> 18:06.560
If you're not driving,
and we help each other.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.400
- I help you, you help me.
- But you're not alive.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.440
Now I have you!

18:17.000 --> 18:20.919
- You don't want my help?
- Yes Yes! Help me!

18:21.120 --> 18:23.919
- Then you help me too.
- Yes Yes!

18:24.080 --> 18:27.200
- Say you want to help me.
- I would like to help you!

18:27.360 --> 18:30.080
- What are you doing?
- You're just driving.

18:39.879 --> 18:42.759
Rejoice for you, lorterov!

18:42.920 --> 18:45.999
You are done! Done!!

19:02.880 --> 19:05.839

Do you want?

19:08.280 --> 19:12.159
Arh, not again. If you call me
Harlequin, I'll stick you.

19:14.199 --> 19:18.679
- Hi, Laske Ladeport.
- Sune, I'm in the middle of something.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.320

19:34.839 --> 19:38.040
So, Jessica, which you love.

19:38.199 --> 19:40.519
Where are you letting go of.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.040
Is that a poem, this one?
"You're a princess."

19:44.199 --> 19:46.159
- How dear.
- Give it to me.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.920
Of course. As soon as
I get my book report.

19:50.079 --> 19:53.359
It's for tomorrow.
"Lord of the Rings" 1 to 3.

19:53.520 --> 19:58.279
You can do it, don't you, Ash?
And do you trouble, right?

19:58.440 --> 20:01.759
Otherwise it ends up here on the web.
Thank you, Brother Man.

20:02.919 --> 20:05.919
I wish you were dead.

20:06.079 --> 20:10.159
Wow, cool saying, anyway.
You're a fucking coward, you are.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.359
You are only a child, but it is
Sune too. And him the bumblebee.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.519
Glenn! Do you realize,
what you did?

20:16.680 --> 20:20.239
Yes, I stopped him.
And well-known.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.080
He's killing me.

20:22.239 --> 20:25.399
Oh, you want to sob. As if you have
some real problems.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.879
Don't I have problems?
I'm talking to my teddy bear.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.439
I'm not a teddy bear, fuckhead!
I'm a warrior.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.159
And I have a little trouble
to take your drama piss seriously.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.679
You must either stick your tail
between the legs or fight.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.839
- I can't fight.
- You never tried.

20:43.999 --> 20:47.520
- I am helping you.
- But who are you at all?

20:47.679 --> 20:52.399
I'm your new girlfriend.
I have promised to help you.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.079
- And you promised to help me.
- What can I help you with?

20:56.239 --> 21:00.319
- You can read, don't you?
- Yeah. Can't you?

21:01.999 --> 21:05.760
- Then I can do some other things, right?
- Yes, keep it.

21:05.919 --> 21:08.599
What is here?

21:08.760 --> 21:12.399
It's a credit card.
It belongs to Phillip Eber seed.

21:12.559 --> 21:15.159
He's the one I'm looking for.

21:15.319 --> 21:18.240
Eberfrø? It's like Jessica.

21:18.399 --> 21:21.480
- What do you mean?
- Her name is Jessica Eberfrø.

21:21.639 --> 21:25.639
Her ham, you're crazy about?
What's her father's name?

21:25.800 --> 21:29.319
- I don't know.
- Who knows?

21:33.480 --> 21:36.199
- Mother?
- Hi, Lademand.

21:36.360 --> 21:41.160
I have a group tonight, so Jorn
fits you. Now don't run out, right?

21:41.319 --> 21:44.400
- I bought you a cold bowl.
- Fat, but...

21:44.559 --> 21:48.199
- Sune is going to party on Saturday.
- At Jessica.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.759
You know about her parents
is home to the party?

21:51.919 --> 21:55.200
They are the ones I have
spoke to Linda and...

21:57.319 --> 21:59.599
be home both.

21:59.760 --> 22:04.080
- Hey darling. How did it go?
- They weren't interested.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.039
They couldn't see the difference
ordinary lunch boxes -

22:07.200 --> 22:09.799
- and the Kixi-Box system.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.560
They come back
and scratch the door, just wait.

22:13.719 --> 22:17.839
So you talked to
Linda and ...? And?

22:20.079 --> 22:23.839
- And?
- And Jessica's father is there too.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.399
Jessica's father, Phillip? The clown.

22:27.559 --> 22:32.479
He thinks he knows everything about toys.
He got my Nixi-Dixier thwarted.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.079
Jessica's father.

22:35.239 --> 22:39.919
Or father-in-law, not, Ash?
He loves Jessica.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.039
Uuh! Believe it, Ash.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.239
Off for Satan!
Can't you move your shit?

22:48.240 --> 22:52.320
So, Sune.
Pure speech gives pure heart.

22:52.479 --> 22:57.480
- I think Jessica is a sod girl.
- But Ash is just that... Ash.

22:57.639 --> 23:01.879
Jessica is like that
a really small snacky-pack.

23:07.399 --> 23:10.599
Snacky-Pack? Not bad.

23:12.039 --> 23:14.599
- Wait.
- No, you're heavy in the ass.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.919
Jorn won't have
I'm going out in the evening.

23:18.079 --> 23:21.999
- It was then a shame for Jørn.
- He totally flies. Do you hear?

23:22.159 --> 23:26.239
I wrote it down in the book with
everything I do. It's thick.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.879
- I'm going close to Jessica's father.
- Can't we just give her the card?

23:31.039 --> 23:36.319
No, it must be handed over to him
personally. It is an honor story.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.640
- Is it here?
- Yes.

23:38.799 --> 23:43.800
It's the Builder. Whoever I have
built with Odysseus.

23:43.959 --> 23:46.560
Then you should be an architect.

23:48.079 --> 23:50.359
See. Klammo.

23:50.520 --> 23:54.600
- Give it to me. We can use that.
- Use? How?

23:54.759 --> 23:59.439
A ninja takes advantage of every opportunity.
Always ready to improvise.

23:59.599 --> 24:03.720
- So we have no plan?
- Yeah. We're going to Jessica's party.

24:03.879 --> 24:07.639
- She only invites the "cool".
- And Sune.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.799
He goes in eighth.
It counts as cool.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.919
- And then we have Glenn.
- Who wants to kill me.

24:13.119 --> 24:17.799
We must put him in place.
Then I also think Jessica will say:

24:17.959 --> 24:20.519
Ash, you're cool.

24:20.679 --> 24:24.479
- Stop it. It's megacreepy.
- Yes, but also a little cool, right?

24:25.639 --> 24:29.039
- Now we said I was Glenn.
- Do you want me to fix him?

24:29.199 --> 24:31.119
- What's the problem?
- I can not.

24:31.279 --> 24:34.519
Do you know why you can't?
Because you think you can't.

24:34.679 --> 24:38.719
- And then he's bigger than me.
- You are also bigger than me.

24:38.879 --> 24:41.519
Right now. But not now.

24:41.679 --> 24:46.319
- Do you have to look after the dill?
- It was the groin. Come on, your turn.

24:46.479 --> 24:50.999
- Underneath the belt is so cool.
- You're already sweeping. Use it though.

24:51.159 --> 24:56.159
Come, kick me, as hard as you can.
Come on, chuckle.

25:00.079 --> 25:01.479
Off for Satan!

25:01.639 --> 25:04.199
- You say that pretty much.
- It does pretty much hurt.

25:04.359 --> 25:07.799
Okay, but going all over the world
hear about it? Eat it.

25:07.959 --> 25:09.639
Come again.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.399
Up.

25:23.359 --> 25:25.319
Look, it's coming.

25:28.519 --> 25:30.359
Well, where is the tool?

25:30.519 --> 25:34.399
- It's locked in at night.
- <i>So</i> we'll get it tomorrow.

25:34.559 --> 25:36.879
- What should we build?
- One thing at a time.

25:37.039 --> 25:40.839
- You have to go home and do homework.
- But I have nothing for that.

25:40.999 --> 25:44.999
Yes, you have a book report for
for tomorrow. Did you forget it?

25:45.159 --> 25:48.719
"'Lord of the Rings'
is Tolkien's famous trilogy -

25:48.879 --> 25:53.399
- about the good fight against evil."
So, Ash!

25:53.559 --> 25:56.879
- And then there was my draft book.
- You mean this?

25:59.279 --> 26:00.519
Idiot.

26:00.679 --> 26:05.319
Ash, you went out last night
Nevertheless. You must obey!

26:05.479 --> 26:09.279
Jørn! What the hell is that,
there <i>lay</i> inside <i>on</i> your bedside table?

26:09.439 --> 26:11.599
Øøh...

26:12.879 --> 26:15.679
"Grandma's Nasty Bags"?

26:29.439 --> 26:33.799
Well, I get tools,
and you distract the teacher while.

26:33.959 --> 26:37.239
- What do I do?
- Get him to help you.

26:37.399 --> 26:41.799
With something difficult. Can you not
make a swordsheath for me?

26:41.959 --> 26:44.199
I can not walk
and flutter with it here.

26:44.359 --> 26:48.879
It must fit the sword in the length
and have cords to tie on the back.

26:49.039 --> 26:52.759
And it must have a hole in both ends,
so it can be used as a snorkel.

26:52.919 --> 26:56.639
- Should there be diamonds too?
- Do I look like a bitch? Get off.

27:06.839 --> 27:09.759
Siberius,
could you help me with anything?

27:13.719 --> 27:17.799
Ash, what can I do for you?

27:17.959 --> 27:21.199
Fits that you can
build anything?

27:21.359 --> 27:25.359
Then I have my hands
screwed on well. Say it.

27:25.519 --> 27:29.159
Can't help me then?
Building a stage?

27:29.319 --> 27:32.919
- But what?
- A stage. Preferably the check.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.959
I have never seen a checkered stage,
but variety is so common.

27:37.119 --> 27:40.999
You want me to help you
with building a ...?

27:42.879 --> 27:46.999
Sheath, please.
It doesn't have to be <i>so</i> great.

27:47.159 --> 27:50.759
Only you can breathe through
it and tie it to the back.

27:58.479 --> 28:03.119
- You didn't give me much time.
- One must obviously not make weapons.

28:03.279 --> 28:05.119
Piss, I got it all.

28:05.279 --> 28:08.359
Explain to the principal that Gandalf
filled his hat with thin skid,

28:08.519 --> 28:11.599
Gollum pissed in his mouth
and troubled over four orcs.

28:11.759 --> 28:15.759
Yes, but he has...
That's how I understand it.

28:15.919 --> 28:18.919
- Boys!
- I understood that too.

28:19.119 --> 28:24.239
Enjoy your life until the free night,
where Jessica gets your fine poem.

28:24.399 --> 28:28.879
- You mean this?
- Don't you think I took a copy?

28:29.759 --> 28:31.799
Give it to me!

28:33.799 --> 28:35.839
Give me that!

28:35.999 --> 28:38.639
So, two. Stop that!

28:38.799 --> 28:41.119
Sune, you come with me.

28:43.839 --> 28:46.399
- Fuck my life.
- It will probably work out.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.759
You heard him.
In the free night I finished.

28:49.919 --> 28:52.799
- Would you mind.
- It's megapine.

28:52.959 --> 28:55.759
So, please, beware
and do something about it.

29:04.919 --> 29:09.399
One, two, one, two.
It's Arne with a call.

29:09.559 --> 29:13.439
A message for everyone
who has signed up for extra music.

29:13.599 --> 29:16.479
Little cow is Tuesday from 13-15, -

29:16.639 --> 29:20.999
- and great interaction
is Thursday from 14-15.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.919
Look into the fight, friends.
Everyone has the right to rhythm.

29:24.079 --> 29:27.199
That was all.
Sorry to interrupt.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.399
Shit Unger.

29:34.359 --> 29:38.599
Then there was just
a message from Aske from seventh -

29:38.759 --> 29:43.319
- to a very special girl,
who should hear how sick nice she is.

29:43.479 --> 29:47.279
I think she should know.
Yes, she must.

29:47.439 --> 29:52.839
And if you ask who Ash is,
then I'm a little desperate boy -

29:52.999 --> 29:58.039
- with a nice big mouth
and a completely flat nose. Well, anyways...

29:58.199 --> 30:04.079
The girl it is about is...
I can almost hear my heart hammer.

30:04.239 --> 30:06.839
Jessica from eighth!

30:06.999 --> 30:09.879
- It doesn't happen, this one.
- Yeah, you heard right.

30:10.039 --> 30:13.679
I am crazy about you,
and the whole school may know it.

30:13.839 --> 30:18.599
<i>You're a high-end piece
with physician'sness!</i>

30:18.759 --> 30:22.319
<i>It was all.
Excuse the disturbance.</i>

30:24.839 --> 30:28.919
Then you want to stop it there.
It is strictly forbidden.

30:29.119 --> 30:32.839
But brave, I must say so.
Believe it, Ash.

30:36.959 --> 30:40.919
Wuhu! Jessica, like that!

30:41.119 --> 30:44.359
- Jessica!
- My Beloved!

30:44.519 --> 30:48.079
- Your traitor.
- The problem is then lost.

30:48.239 --> 30:50.999
- Is that solved?
- So what, Casanova!

30:51.158 --> 30:54.719
Yes. Now you've done it,
you were most afraid of.

30:54.878 --> 30:57.079
Now by the ham, how are you.

30:57.239 --> 31:00.479
Then Sune can dry ass in his copy
and drink piss for dessert.

31:00.638 --> 31:05.039
- The whole school laughs at me.
- Straighten the back. We're going to the canteen.

31:05.198 --> 31:08.198
- But then we mother Glenn.
- Exactly.

31:15.638 --> 31:20.399
Climb up the trash can.
Trust me. Get up.

31:20.558 --> 31:22.279
What then, scortrold?

31:23.359 --> 31:25.118
Uuuh!

31:28.679 --> 31:33.559
I take the word and you mime.
Can you spit? Then do it now.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.719
Hello, everyone! Listen up!

31:45.878 --> 31:49.598
Here you see the biggest idiot
in the whole school,

31:49.759 --> 31:53.239
Glenn from the special class!

31:53.399 --> 31:54.398
What?

31:54.559 --> 31:59.119
How many of you are ever
bothered by the beast?

32:03.158 --> 32:04.199
Here!

32:05.239 --> 32:07.319
- Me!
- Me!

32:07.478 --> 32:08.839
So am I!

32:11.879 --> 32:16.598
That's why I, Aske from 7.b,
in the name of justice -

32:16.759 --> 32:20.639
- Bring a challenge to you,
Glenn Bumsefjæs.

32:20.798 --> 32:26.558
At seven o'clock on Saturday night at Byggeren.
You and me, if you dare.

32:28.039 --> 32:32.798
Are you insane? If I think?
So, I totally smash you.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.599
And the loser goes
someone in school on Monday!

32:35.759 --> 32:39.638
We say that. You don't come
to be able to <i>go</i> on Monday.

32:39.799 --> 32:42.158
- Tabernacle!
- He's right.

32:42.319 --> 32:45.439
- Come down from there.
- Very much.

32:45.599 --> 32:50.159
It will be really entertaining!
Everyone is welcome at Byggeren!

32:50.318 --> 32:52.838
Saturday night at seven!

32:54.518 --> 32:56.159
Connect.

32:57.319 --> 33:02.639
Cool, Ash! I come and movies,
so you can see it when you wake up.

33:03.599 --> 33:05.639
What then, Tarzan?

33:05.798 --> 33:09.878
Do you have a list of crazy things,
You need to reach because you are dying?

33:10.039 --> 33:12.479
- By Ebola maybe.
- Maybe Ebola.

33:12.638 --> 33:16.639
If you still live on Saturday night,
you can look over. I'm partying.

33:16.799 --> 33:18.719
Øøh...

33:18.878 --> 33:23.119
- "Fat, a hundred p. We come."
- See you. Maybe.

33:28.559 --> 33:31.919
Will you tell me
what the plan is?

33:32.078 --> 33:37.519
Instead of waiting to get bitch,
Then we ourselves have chosen the battlefield.

33:37.679 --> 33:40.879
- Does it matter?
- No, we're at home.

33:41.039 --> 33:44.438
And now you've got peace
until Saturday at seven.

33:44.599 --> 33:46.919
Unless Glenn won't wait.

33:47.119 --> 33:51.199
You challenged him in front of the whole school
and promised to make you laugh.

33:51.359 --> 33:56.279
So he waits until Saturday and thinks,
An honest fight awaits him.

33:56.438 --> 33:58.199
Doesn't it do that?

33:58.358 --> 34:00.559
Are you idiot?

34:14.759 --> 34:19.679
He has made other films, though
The "night watch" is his only success.

35:08.318 --> 35:10.958
- I've got a splinter.
- Should I breathe?

35:11.119 --> 35:15.638
Your pimple, I screw up then.
It's real cashmere.

35:15.799 --> 35:20.359
- Are you really a real ninja?
- What do you know about ninjas at all?

35:20.519 --> 35:24.079
They lived in Japan in the old days, right?

35:24.239 --> 35:28.759
Especially in the Iga area. They lived
hidden in the ode forests of the mountains.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.319
They were spies and murderers, didn't they?

35:31.478 --> 35:35.678
It had nothing to do with money. The
protected their secret communities.

35:35.839 --> 35:38.839
- Who was after them?
- The Samurai.

35:38.999 --> 35:42.599
They felt threatened
ninjas religion and way of life.

35:42.758 --> 35:48.678
Their biggest prince sent <i>40,000</i>
fighters out to slaughter the clans.

35:48.839 --> 35:52.638
- How did it go?
- A few escaped.

35:52.799 --> 35:57.839
Most died. And then there was one,
who somehow did both.

35:57.998 --> 36:00.398
- Taiko Nakamura.
- Who?

36:00.558 --> 36:02.958
<i>Taiko Nakamura
sitting in a cabin</i>

36:03.119 --> 36:05.598
<i>with the ten of the clan's children
he is set to protect</i>

36:05.759 --> 36:08.039
<i>when the enemies stormed the village
he was entrusted</i>

36:08.198 --> 36:10.233
<i>This honorable office
of the head of the clan itself</i>

36:10.358 --> 36:13.358
<i>The same whore now
betrayed the sleeping children</i>

36:13.518 --> 36:17.598
<i>and guided Nobunaga's warriors
right to the door</i>

36:20.639 --> 36:23.558
<i>Nakamura meets death
his courage is indomitable</i>

36:23.718 --> 36:26.238
<i>Determined
taking as many people as possible</i>

36:26.399 --> 36:29.159
<i>He's got sixteen samuras
before he falls for No. Seventeen</i>

36:29.318 --> 36:31.919
<i>and hear the screams
when they burn the hut</i>

36:34.319 --> 36:36.661
<i>He has failed his mission
and while the ruin is burning down</i>

36:36.719 --> 36:39.438
<i>He promises his soul in exchange
for revenge and justice</i>

36:39.599 --> 36:42.078
<i>lightning strikes at the same time
as he pops up his stomach</i>

36:42.278 --> 36:44.813
<i>And you have to believe the story
then the spirit leaves his body</i>

36:44.838 --> 36:46.638
<i>and seeking revenge
before the night is over</i>

36:46.799 --> 36:49.799
<i>finds the guards traitor
and the ten swords that spit his body</i>

36:49.958 --> 36:51.998
<i>and ever since
has it called itself in the area</i>

36:52.158 --> 36:55.118
<i>That Nakamura's spirit is at stake
when it draws up to rain</i>

36:55.278 --> 36:57.318
<i>His soul wanders restlessly around</i>

36:57.479 --> 37:00.198
<i>And suddenly it turns down with lightning
in living as dead things</i>

37:00.359 --> 37:02.838
<i>to punish them
there is no clean flour in the bag</i>

37:02.999 --> 37:05.879
<i>When children suffer distress
and there are owls in the bog</i>

37:06.038 --> 37:08.558
<i>He is forever raging
on lonely quests</i>

37:08.718 --> 37:12.479
<i>Taiko Nakamura justice guardian</i>

37:17.999 --> 37:20.918
- A revenge spirit?
- It says the story.

37:21.119 --> 37:26.399
The spirit can appear anywhere,
even in a fabric doll.

37:27.599 --> 37:29.478
Rrraaah!!

37:29.639 --> 37:33.119
- Idiot.
- You should have seen yourself!

37:36.599 --> 37:39.558
- Ash, have you eaten the last eggs?
- No, Jorn.

37:39.719 --> 37:43.758
I could have sworn we had
egg. Well, <i>so</i> it must be shit.

37:43.919 --> 37:46.638
What else do you need
use your Saturday, Aske?

37:46.799 --> 37:49.799
Ash has big plans.
He has challenged...

37:49.958 --> 37:53.039
Off for Satan!
There was something that stuck me.

37:53.198 --> 37:57.798
It is one of the house buckets,
Aunt Beate talked about.

37:57.959 --> 38:02.198
I give you an Ough
immune defense massage, Sune.

38:02.358 --> 38:05.598
- And so early in bed.
- But I'm going to party.

38:05.759 --> 38:08.318
It doesn't work
eight hours of treatment.

38:08.478 --> 38:13.319
Jorn, have you seen my biodynamic
massage oil? Then it must be skyr.

38:13.478 --> 38:17.798
- Sheep!
- It is for your own good, Sune.

38:24.078 --> 38:28.478
You have to go over
the other side, pimple.

38:28.638 --> 38:32.318
- He is not coming.
- He dares not.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.159
Bumsefjæs!
Are you going to get asshole?

38:35.318 --> 38:38.999
- Come on down here, if you bother!
- Fair enough.

38:41.118 --> 38:42.558
He got an egg in the dish.

38:46.679 --> 38:48.959
What the hell are you doing?

39:04.319 --> 39:08.558
- I'm smashing your head!
- That's the way it's supposed to sound. Come on, ugly.

39:17.118 --> 39:19.638
Ash! Ash!! Ash!

39:35.118 --> 39:36.599
Kukkuk!

39:36.758 --> 39:39.239
Now I have you!

39:46.919 --> 39:48.438
Yes!

39:51.758 --> 39:52.799
Arh, piss.

39:57.438 --> 40:00.798
- Are we going to move on?
- I will kill you!

40:04.518 --> 40:05.478
Hey.

40:26.238 --> 40:28.758
Then he can learn it!

40:28.919 --> 40:30.798
Legitious sick, bro.

40:36.558 --> 40:40.998
Ash! Ash! Ash!

41:00.318 --> 41:02.798
Come on!

41:10.438 --> 41:13.838
- Right in the dill!
- Technically, it's the groin.

41:21.158 --> 41:23.238
Off for Satan.

41:28.638 --> 41:30.198
Come on.

41:33.278 --> 41:34.958
Off for Satan!

41:36.758 --> 41:39.358
Off, let go!

41:47.718 --> 41:50.758
- Was it an apology?
- Ouch! Yes Yes!

41:50.918 --> 41:53.238
- What do you say?
- Pardon.

41:53.398 --> 41:54.878
What?

41:55.038 --> 41:58.358
Pardon!!

42:03.398 --> 42:06.758
So, yes! What then, champ?

42:06.918 --> 42:11.438
So how does it feel to have won?
I stand here with Ash...

42:14.598 --> 42:16.718
Engstien nr. 19.

42:16.878 --> 42:20.518
- We will be there!
- Who called Harry Potter up?

42:20.678 --> 42:23.718
- As if. Come on, Fie.
- Yeah, Mie, come on.

42:23.878 --> 42:27.158
- So, Ash.
- I think we're cool.

42:27.318 --> 42:31.998
<i>When to actually hang on
please remember to make Pesto</i>

42:32.158 --> 42:36.718
<i>Then come and be my guest bro
then you can taste on my pesto</i>

42:37.838 --> 42:40.598
It's awesome.
We're at Jessica's home.

42:40.758 --> 42:46.318
Yes, it's super. Duty first.
We start by finding her father.

42:47.918 --> 42:50.318
<i>Oh that pesto</i>

42:50.478 --> 42:52.838
<i>What do they do for the pesto</i>

42:52.998 --> 42:55.118
<i>in swimsuits or party shoes</i>

42:55.278 --> 42:57.758
<i>there is no dress code for pesto</i>

43:00.718 --> 43:02.278
There he is!

43:02.438 --> 43:04.678
- Hey, Ash.
- Cool gone today.

43:04.838 --> 43:08.678
- Really?
- Yeah, it was megabyte.

43:08.838 --> 43:10.638
- Where are you cool?
- Highfive!

43:10.798 --> 43:14.158
Thanks. I did it,
<i>so</i> well I could.

43:14.318 --> 43:17.638
- Karate Kid!
- Yes it is me.

43:17.798 --> 43:21.838
- You don't hit too hard, right?
- No, that's my dangerous hand.

43:21.998 --> 43:24.678
Well, I have to say hello to the landlady.

43:28.998 --> 43:32.878
Hey, Champ! Bold fight.
There is good smack on it.

43:33.038 --> 43:36.438
- Jessica has just been here.
- Did you see where she went?

43:36.598 --> 43:41.318
- Arh! What about her parents?
- They sit in the kitchen. Delicious mother.

43:41.478 --> 43:44.758
- What about the father?
- No, it's mostly the mother.

43:44.918 --> 43:48.038
- Is he out there too?
- Yes, they keep watch.

43:48.198 --> 43:51.798
- I just wanna pee.
- It's the other way.

43:52.558 --> 43:56.118
- Have we not seen each other ...?
- Talk to your hand, roof fire.

43:56.278 --> 43:59.038
- In stereo.
- And surround sound.

44:02.598 --> 44:06.918
Remember to get your mother out of there.
Just do it now.

44:11.438 --> 44:14.118
The toilet is in the entrance hall.

44:15.958 --> 44:18.918
Uh, there is one,
who has thrown up on the carpet.

44:19.078 --> 44:22.078
Oh no, not again.

44:23.398 --> 44:27.478
And then there was just...
Pardon?

44:27.638 --> 44:28.918
That, oh...

44:29.078 --> 44:32.078
Phillip Eberfrø!

44:35.038 --> 44:39.198
At your service. I got a whole shock.
I should have just suffered.

44:39.358 --> 44:42.758
- What are you doing there?
- It is your card.

44:42.918 --> 44:46.798
Ho-ho, platinum card.
Yeah, just that was mine.

44:46.958 --> 44:50.878
You have to get up there
a little more a month, I think.

44:51.038 --> 44:53.038
Don't you call Phillip Eber seed?

44:53.198 --> 44:57.078
Yes, but with a Swedish island. And I
change name here to the first.

44:57.238 --> 45:01.318
My numerologist has suggested
Sysmund Pejderhagl.

45:01.478 --> 45:06.438
There is so much written about him
toy giant. The card is probably his.

45:06.598 --> 45:09.918
Then you have to go over
Hamburger Rice Allé.

45:10.078 --> 45:13.638
- Aren't you Sunes little brother?
- Yeah. Cardboard.

45:13.798 --> 45:17.518
So greet your stepfather.
He's still the knot, -

45:17.678 --> 45:22.398
- Because I did not grant municipalities
support for his Nixi Dixi dolls.

45:22.558 --> 45:26.158
- Do you want a food?
- Yes, why not? Ouch!

45:26.318 --> 45:29.838
No, I'm just gonna...
Nice to meet you.

45:31.518 --> 45:33.278
It lacks pesto.

45:33.438 --> 45:37.358
What is going on with you?
Why did you call him?

45:37.518 --> 45:40.238
I was anxious.
I'll hand it in short.

45:40.398 --> 45:42.158
Yes yes, relax.

45:42.358 --> 45:44.398
- Ash.
- Hey, Jessica.

45:44.558 --> 45:48.718
- You are crazy.
- Am I?

45:48.878 --> 45:53.318
Otherwise, I thought you were like that
a little rolling with a ninety doll.

45:53.478 --> 45:57.838
No, no, it's just
a gift for my cousin.

45:57.998 --> 46:02.318
- You're a little sweet, you are.
- You can be that yourself.

46:03.278 --> 46:06.638
- Shall we Dance?
- Uh, yes, clearly.

46:08.078 --> 46:09.878
I just have to pee.

46:10.038 --> 46:12.638
- Are you waiting here?
- Yes Yes.

46:12.798 --> 46:15.118
Yes!

46:15.278 --> 46:17.958
- Don't dance now, right?
- Yeah.

46:18.118 --> 46:21.878
Man, I helped you,
and you promised to help me.

46:22.038 --> 46:25.478
- Not right in the middle of the party.
- Fuck the party, this is important!

46:25.638 --> 46:28.878
- Jessica...
- Flush that bag!

46:29.038 --> 46:33.078
I'll help you.
It just won't be right now.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.838
- Your liar!
- Relax.

46:37.998 --> 46:40.758
- You owe me everything.
- Not, you steer straight.

46:40.918 --> 46:44.558
Just guide me?
You are only popular because of me.

46:44.718 --> 46:48.958
You don't have to sound like I'm
couldn't breathe without you.

46:49.118 --> 46:52.598
- It was totally cool, man.
- Especially when he flew through the air.

46:52.758 --> 46:56.678
- There he is. Wild fight, Ash.
- You hadn't seen it come.

46:56.838 --> 47:01.798
- Especially that kung-fu at last.
- It was something I found myself.

47:01.957 --> 47:06.438
- Fat, man. Six, Ash.
- Yes, we are seen in there.

47:06.598 --> 47:10.038
Well, can you do it yourself?
<i>So</i> clear it here!

47:11.437 --> 47:13.878
No! Wait!

47:23.437 --> 47:24.438
Sorry.

47:26.038 --> 47:30.838
Help, I've peeed in the pants!

47:30.997 --> 47:33.438
No, it's not... Off!

47:33.598 --> 47:35.718
Now I'm going to fuck too!

47:35.878 --> 47:38.718
No no! I just want to emphasize...

47:43.758 --> 47:47.158
Jessica, it's me, Ash.

47:47.317 --> 47:51.157
I don't want to dance anyway.
You are under my standard.

47:51.318 --> 47:52.477
What?

47:52.638 --> 47:56.878
I'm a bit of an overcoring for you.
You have to settle for Odysseus.

47:57.037 --> 48:00.037
What?

48:03.478 --> 48:07.038
- Are you an overscoring?
- No, no, I haven't...

48:07.198 --> 48:09.478
Am I below your standard?

48:09.637 --> 48:13.717
What did you say with that
that you had pissed in the pants?

48:13.878 --> 48:18.118
No, it was the ninja.
It's all due to my ninjada doll.

48:18.277 --> 48:20.358
So my cousin's. Jessica...

48:20.518 --> 48:22.678
See you, overscoring.

48:22.837 --> 48:26.478
- Odysseus, shall we sneak?
- Now I'm just thinking about it.

48:26.638 --> 48:28.798
Yes please!

48:28.957 --> 48:31.237
- Come home.
- Odysseus?

48:31.398 --> 48:36.598
The lady will sneak. If not I do
That is, there is just another who does.

48:45.877 --> 48:47.958
Well, did you dance?

48:48.118 --> 48:51.558
What are you doing?
I had promised to help you.

48:51.718 --> 48:55.878
- I need your help now.
- So why are you crushing my life?

48:57.637 --> 49:01.357
Sorry I went over the line.
It's just important, this one.

49:01.518 --> 49:04.357
How can that be short
mean life or death?

49:04.518 --> 49:08.797
It's a nating. An honor story.

49:08.958 --> 49:14.238
Human, if you help me now,
I'll probably do everything well again.

49:14.398 --> 49:17.518
- Do you promise?
- Trust <i>on</i> me.

49:17.677 --> 49:22.518
Okay. I just have a hard time seeing,
how Jessica will be good again.

49:22.678 --> 49:27.517
It was also some strange thing to do
tell her. Lets go!

49:31.837 --> 49:35.838
- Can't he lie to sleep?
- One may well hope. Came.

49:42.997 --> 49:47.278
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm a secret. Came.

49:52.717 --> 49:57.277
Don't call.
He hates when calling.

49:59.797 --> 50:03.078
- Lucky he has a cat.
- A big cat.

50:03.238 --> 50:06.318
Are you afraid of big cats?

50:14.638 --> 50:17.077
You think this is okay?

50:17.238 --> 50:20.478
He gets wildly happy
about getting the card again.

50:20.638 --> 50:25.597
- Can't we just put it to him?
- I want to make sure he's here.

50:29.758 --> 50:33.918
- Piss. I think he's out.
- One suitcase. Maybe he is traveling.

50:34.078 --> 50:38.797
Because there is a suitcase here?
Are you related to Glenn?

50:38.958 --> 50:43.758
- Maybe <i>should</i> travel.
- We just have to find out.

50:47.317 --> 50:48.918
Bingo!

50:50.758 --> 50:52.837
- What did you say?
- There are bingo!

50:55.038 --> 50:59.317
- A plane ticket to Thailand.
- He must visit his slave factory.

50:59.478 --> 51:03.358
- Can you see when he travels?
- What is this going on?

51:16.678 --> 51:20.077
I don't pay a penny,
if not, it's okay.

51:20.238 --> 51:24.877
Yes, we look at it out there.
It is well. We see you.

51:25.038 --> 51:28.278
Was there anything, basse? Hello?

51:28.438 --> 51:31.798
Anyone here? Hello?

51:31.957 --> 51:34.558
- Now I have you!
- What the hell?

51:39.037 --> 51:41.238
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

51:46.398 --> 51:48.478
- Shit!
- Help!

51:48.637 --> 51:52.117
- What are you doing?
- He sticks off, fuckhoved!

51:53.998 --> 51:57.558
Hello, it's here! Save me!

51:57.718 --> 52:01.398
- It was good, you came.
- What happens, Mr Eberfrø?

52:01.558 --> 52:04.918
- They throw with knives.
- We go up and check out.

52:05.077 --> 52:06.877
Block the door quickly.

52:08.638 --> 52:12.157
- May I have an explanation!
- Shouldn't we get away first?

52:12.318 --> 52:16.717
What is this going on? It has
not a skid with the card to do.

52:16.878 --> 52:20.437
Phillip Eberfrø is evil.
He killed a boy.

52:20.597 --> 52:23.878
And he uses child slaves
to make his toys.

52:24.037 --> 52:27.917
- Do you want to kill him or what?
- Something in that style.

52:28.078 --> 52:32.158
Did you see the flight times? Remember them.
And take the collar.

52:32.357 --> 52:36.358
- So from that one?
- Yes, unless you have one yourself.

52:39.317 --> 52:41.077
It's called Bingo.

52:43.837 --> 52:47.317
- So help me!
- Here, just behind the ear.

52:49.237 --> 52:53.398
- It's the guard! Close up!
- I just need clothes.

52:55.957 --> 52:57.917
What are you doing?

52:58.078 --> 53:00.037
We turn in the door!

53:01.237 --> 53:05.197
Give me the collar.
Grab. Come on, besides.

53:05.357 --> 53:07.597
What? I can't.

53:09.077 --> 53:10.757
Bingo!

53:17.677 --> 53:19.717
There is a blast!

53:19.877 --> 53:21.797
That's how, bingo!

53:29.357 --> 53:32.957
- It's you, right? Taiko Kamakura.
- Nakamura.

53:33.118 --> 53:35.917
- You took advantage of me.
- You promised to help me.

53:36.077 --> 53:39.478
By submitting a card,
not to kill people.

53:39.637 --> 53:43.198
- He killed a little boy.
- And now you want to kill him?

53:43.357 --> 53:45.917
It's called justice!

53:47.197 --> 53:52.318
- And what about the other children's slaves?
- That kind of thing happens all the time.

53:52.477 --> 53:57.358
Well then everything is in beautiful order.
Just tell me when he is flying.

53:57.517 --> 54:01.277
No. I do not want
something to do with it.

54:10.357 --> 54:11.957
Say it!

54:12.118 --> 54:15.917
No. Do what you want.
I'm done.

54:25.198 --> 54:30.317
Man, I can't kill you.
We've been through too much.

54:32.317 --> 54:35.717
But maybe it is
easier for me with...

54:37.078 --> 54:38.797
Sune.

54:38.957 --> 54:42.277
- You do not.
- You wanted him dead.

54:42.437 --> 54:46.717
- That's just something you say.
- For me, this is something you do.

54:51.637 --> 54:53.557
No, stop!

54:53.717 --> 54:55.318
Wait!

55:00.037 --> 55:02.477
- Lorteunge!
- Pardon.

55:18.238 --> 55:19.798
Sune!

55:25.078 --> 55:26.717
Sune!

55:30.757 --> 55:33.838
What happens? Is there food?

55:38.038 --> 55:39.958
Stop! No!

55:41.998 --> 55:44.717
Ash, stop! Ash!

55:47.237 --> 55:50.477
What are you doing, Ash?
Well...

55:50.638 --> 55:53.797
Are you okay, Fnuggi?
Ash, put that pillow.

55:53.957 --> 55:57.917
- Put the pillow, Ash.
- It was not me. Do you think so?

55:58.997 --> 56:02.837
It was the ninja.
He's out there somewhere!

56:04.037 --> 56:07.037
He wants help,
but I will not be a murderer.

56:07.198 --> 56:11.237
- What's going on, my boy?
- Mom, you have to believe in me.

56:11.398 --> 56:15.598
The checkered ninja is alive,
and he will kill Sune!

56:17.077 --> 56:19.237
But...

56:19.397 --> 56:22.477
Stress. Simply stress.
He just has to be completely calm.

56:22.637 --> 56:25.757
- But how long?
- A couple of weeks maybe.

56:25.918 --> 56:28.277
We can't just do that leave him.

56:28.438 --> 56:31.637
We can't have that
he tries to kill Sune.

56:31.798 --> 56:35.237
- I do not think so either.
- It was your ninja!

56:37.318 --> 56:39.238
Hello!

56:39.397 --> 56:43.957
Give him this dreamcatcher
to take the top of the tensions.

56:44.117 --> 56:49.157
So, go home now and get some sleep.
Ash is in good hands here with us.

57:04.678 --> 57:08.437
<i>When, little Aske, though.</i>

57:08.597 --> 57:12.478
<i>So you lost
Yet the cookies. Poor thing.</i>

57:15.077 --> 57:17.758
<i>There must be stress.</i>

57:20.797 --> 57:22.918
Where are you?!

57:23.077 --> 57:24.157
What?

57:27.238 --> 57:28.678
Kukkuk!

57:28.837 --> 57:32.278
Great room.
Here is so much fun.

57:34.877 --> 57:37.678
- Tell me when he goes.
- Never!

57:44.477 --> 57:47.077
- You wanted to kill my brother!
- Dad.

57:47.237 --> 57:50.437
You welcomed my help,
But you won't help me.

57:50.597 --> 57:52.757
You're not really smart!

57:54.437 --> 57:57.437
Are you too nice to
to <i>get</i> blood <i>on</i> hands?

57:57.597 --> 58:00.597
So try to give your teddy bear
blame for this.

58:00.757 --> 58:05.397
- Doctor, come straight.
- Two minutes, Ash, <i>so</i> I come.

58:05.557 --> 58:08.317
Are you thinking?
Killing an innocent man?

58:08.477 --> 58:10.837
It's him or Eber seed.

58:10.997 --> 58:15.357
Come on, Doctor!
There is fire in my bed!

58:15.517 --> 58:19.797
Eber seeds must be punished, but you
do not have to kill him.

58:19.957 --> 58:23.677
You think I'm happy throwing
an egg in the head <i>on</i> stuttering?

58:23.837 --> 58:28.597
I want to see him dead.
He must have the hardest punishment.

58:28.757 --> 58:31.797
Punishment? Um...

58:31.957 --> 58:35.917
Well why not
punish him even harder?

58:36.077 --> 58:39.357
What if we can get him to
to wish he was dead?

58:39.517 --> 58:44.277
We can get the shovel under Eber seed,
but we are busy. He'll be leaving soon.

58:44.437 --> 58:47.597
Hello, I can't avenge
a child murder without blood.

58:47.757 --> 58:52.077
Can not? It doesn't sound like you,
the great Kamakura.

58:52.237 --> 58:55.837
You just think you can't.
You told me that.

58:55.997 --> 59:00.717
And you were right. I could.
You made me dare.

59:00.877 --> 59:03.717
- And now you don't dare yourself.
- What am I not doing?

59:03.877 --> 59:06.277
I'm putting him right.

59:06.437 --> 59:10.957
You dare not change your view of things.
Why have you been joking for 400 years?

59:11.117 --> 59:14.717
- You don't even trust me.
- Don't say, I'm not!

59:14.877 --> 59:19.877
Then prove it. Trust me.
We get Eber seeds down with the neck.

59:25.757 --> 59:30.597
Well, Ash, that's it
by being bedtime.

59:38.277 --> 59:41.917
And then I think
You're ready to shut us out, right?

59:42.077 --> 59:44.597
Yes Yes...

59:44.757 --> 59:48.077
Yeah, well, we're a little busy.

59:50.757 --> 59:55.557
I tell your parents that you
just need to have completely free frames.

59:55.717 --> 59:58.157
And lots of cold bowl.

59:58.317 --> 01:00:02.357
Yes, it will help on everything.
I'll call right away.

01:00:02.517 --> 01:00:05.717
Great,
Miss Mukupa, party trooper!

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.557
- What is the plan?
- He's traveling tonight.

01:00:10.717 --> 01:00:14.157
- We must have stopped him.
- No, we must get a farewell gift.

01:00:14.317 --> 01:00:17.677
- One he has to bring to Thailand.
- I got a hood.

01:00:17.837 --> 01:00:20.277
- We're going out to my uncle.
- Him the stiff?

01:00:20.437 --> 01:00:22.277
Yæssir!

01:00:23.197 --> 01:00:26.357
<i>I'm bad at canasta
and to rommy and to whist</i>

01:00:26.517 --> 01:00:30.237
<i>I always get bitch in UNO

01:00:30.397 --> 01:00:33.437
<i>Never me who pulls last plug</i>

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:35.837
<i>But I'm the best in the world

01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:44.477
<i>I'm no eagle to tennis

01:00:44.637 --> 01:00:47.997
<i>I'm ridiculous for football

01:00:48.157 --> 01:00:50.997

01:00:51.197 --> 01:00:53.557
<i>But I'm the best in the world

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:57.477
<i>Who's knocking now?
The world's best to play...</i>

01:00:57.637 --> 01:00:59.477
<i>I hurry I hurry</i>

01:00:59.637 --> 01:01:02.797
<i>The world's best to play

01:01:02.957 --> 01:01:05.117
<i>to play...</i>

01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:08.157
- Hello!
- Yes, yes then.

01:01:09.117 --> 01:01:10.117
Hey.

01:01:10.277 --> 01:01:14.517
Ashtray, how cozy.
I was about to sing dick.

01:01:14.677 --> 01:01:17.117
- May I enter?
- Yes, come in.

01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:20.277
- Are you okay?
- Yes Yes.

01:01:20.437 --> 01:01:24.157
Off for satan in the nun fish!
Do you want a mirror egg?

01:01:24.357 --> 01:01:27.517
- No thanks.
- Leave as if you're at home.

01:01:27.677 --> 01:01:31.437
I just came to hear,
if you wanted to help with anything.

01:01:31.597 --> 01:01:35.517
We have a job at school
about drugs.

01:01:35.677 --> 01:01:42.077
- I'm not taking that kind of shit.
- No, but you know so much about life.

01:01:42.237 --> 01:01:46.917
Yes, that's right enough. I have
My walk in the hallway, as you say.

01:01:47.077 --> 01:01:51.317
I move in some circles,
I know my lice <i>on</i> trot.

01:01:51.477 --> 01:01:54.757
Yes, I know enough,
where David bought the beer.

01:01:54.917 --> 01:01:59.037
I have to investigate how
one gets hold of such substances.

01:01:59.197 --> 01:02:03.877
You just call it after that,
and then it is delivered to the door.

01:02:04.037 --> 01:02:06.597
- Really?
- That's how it happens.

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:10.677
- So, I think. What do I know?
- But who do you call?

01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:14.597
I don't know, Ash.
And even if I did,

01:02:14.757 --> 01:02:19.357
I couldn't tell you,
that he is called Scooter-Schrøder.

01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:22.077
And what do you say then
for Scooter-roots?

01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:25.597
You say, "What then, Square?"

01:02:25.757 --> 01:02:28.917
I shouldn't have said that.
That's his code name.

01:02:29.077 --> 01:02:32.237
- And then you just order?
- Yeah, a little hidden.

01:02:32.397 --> 01:02:37.837
"Can you look past? I'll bake,
but I'm running for flour."

01:02:37.997 --> 01:02:41.477
- And then he comes with it?
- Not to anyone.

01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:46.237
You couldn't just call.
Well, if you greeted Stewart.

01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:51.477
Yes, maybe by a single
festive occasion. Yes, or two.

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:56.077
Max three. And never in everyday life.
Unless it's summer.

01:02:56.237 --> 01:02:59.437
Do you have a number,
so I can call him?

01:02:59.597 --> 01:03:02.917
No, I can't do it
Give you his number.

01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:06.717
It is safe here
in my little black book,

01:03:06.877 --> 01:03:11.077
which only I have access to.
But this is an exciting task.

01:03:13.237 --> 01:03:16.797
Want a can of mackerel
or something? Ash?

01:03:18.437 --> 01:03:21.357
Hm, I could have sworn,
there were guests.

01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:24.357
Well, to hell with that.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.397
Yæssirs.

<i>What, Square? It is...

01:03:50.357 --> 01:03:54.156

- Him the stiff? Okay.

01:03:55.197 --> 01:04:00.957
<i>Yes, I stand and have to bake.
You know, snails or such.</i>

01:04:01.116 --> 01:04:04.397

- Where are you?

01:04:04.557 --> 01:04:08.997
I'm in my room.
Or, I'm in the bath.

01:04:09.197 --> 01:04:11.556
What? Are you stupid or what?

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:13.397
Yes.

01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:18.357
Okay. I just need a few places.
Against me in the EFKA parking garage.

01:04:18.516 --> 01:04:21.437
Hi, man.
Do you want a cold bowl?

01:04:21.597 --> 01:04:24.597
Not right now.
Or right now is fine.

01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:26.796
How much do you need?

01:04:26.957 --> 01:04:29.597
- We can make it to-go.
- I don't need anything.

01:04:29.757 --> 01:04:32.757
- Can you decide?
- Just say when.

01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:34.517
Not, Ash?

01:04:34.677 --> 01:04:37.037
- Hello?
- Sorry, a pound.

01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:40.397
- You're going through badly.
<i>- One kilogram.</i>

01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:44.477
- One kilo? Like a thousand grams?
<i>- Namely.</i>

01:04:44.637 --> 01:04:46.997
- What are you doing?
- It's part of the plan.

01:04:47.196 --> 01:04:50.076
To say no to cold bowl? Bold plan.

01:04:50.237 --> 01:04:52.997
<i>- Can you afford all that flour?</i>
- Yes Yes.

01:04:53.196 --> 01:04:56.076
<i>Otherwise, there will be smoke in the kitchen.
Do you understand?</i>

01:04:56.237 --> 01:04:59.196
- Yes, yes, of course.
- We'll see you soon.

Hi, Square.
It's me who is Glenn.

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:25.757
- You?
- Yes.

01:05:26.676 --> 01:05:30.516
Okay. You probably shouldn't
Take it all at once.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:34.236
You have no problem with
that I am a child?

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:38.237
If I'm not selling to you,
there is just another who does.

01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:42.077
- Do you have money?
- Yeah, for the fuck. Here.

01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:45.437
- Is there an idiot in my forehead?
- Yes.

01:05:45.597 --> 01:05:49.077
- Give me that money, man!
- It was stupid.

01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:51.797
Really stupid.

01:05:57.396 --> 01:06:01.716
- Don't leave me here!
- Don't worry, the police are on their way.

01:06:01.877 --> 01:06:04.757
Help! Let me out!

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:07.397
Somebody!

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:41.676
Be so polite, so it's open.
Are you sure that is enough?

01:06:41.837 --> 01:06:46.077
Yes. When they find it, they block
him inside and throw the key away.

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:49.956
Beware of the needle.
It's real cashmere.

01:06:50.117 --> 01:06:55.757
- I have had handwork since then.
- Beautiful, <i>so</i> then you should be an architect.

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:59.556
- I have something for you.
- To me? A gift?

01:06:59.717 --> 01:07:03.357
No, one... What is it?
A Steiner binoculars?

01:07:03.516 --> 01:07:07.917
Turn around. I thought,
You must be ready for your mission.

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:12.357
You can't go
and flutter with it there.

01:07:12.516 --> 01:07:17.076
- You made a...
- Of cardboard, <i>so</i> it can't tolerate water.

01:07:19.637 --> 01:07:23.717
- I have nothing for you at all.
- I've had so much.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.517
It's been fun.

01:07:29.676 --> 01:07:32.517
Yes, it does.

01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:46.877
Yes, give it a slip, tos. We're going to war.

01:07:56.597 --> 01:07:59.037
<i>For security reasons</i>
<i>and because of the risk of theft</i> -

01:07:59.196 --> 01:08:03.477
<i>- Must baggage and other belongings
not left unattended.</i>

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:09.317
Good when Eber seed comes,
he must check his luggage in there.

01:08:09.477 --> 01:08:14.436
When he looks away,
you jump into his bag.

01:08:14.597 --> 01:08:18.357
Hello?
What are you doing with my phone?

01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:22.997
I just had to find my sword.
Is he there?

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:27.117
There, it's him.

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:38.435
This is it.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:42.276
What? oh no!

01:08:42.437 --> 01:08:46.356
He goes directly into security!
He takes the bag on board.

01:08:49.956 --> 01:08:52.356
Sorry, I'm going past.

01:08:54.477 --> 01:08:57.636
- No!
- Fuck. So what do we do?

01:08:58.997 --> 01:09:02.397
You have to take it there
and then change in Bangkok.

01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:10.437
Okay, now.

01:09:12.996 --> 01:09:15.837
- Good luck.
- Yes, <i>go</i> now.

01:09:15.996 --> 01:09:19.077
- Can I help the next one?
- It must be me.

01:09:19.236 --> 01:09:23.636
I'm gonna play golf.
It's nice to move a little.

01:09:53.796 --> 01:09:58.036
<i>Head full of thoughts
but the body feels empty</i>

01:10:00.556 --> 01:10:03.516
<i>I have reverse homesickness
because I know it never gets</i>

01:10:03.676 --> 01:10:06.156
<i>as before you came</i>

01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:12.276
<i>Suddenly the race had run
and I got it '</i>

01:10:12.436 --> 01:10:15.597
<i>It was just a moment</i>

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:20.116
<i>I opdaged 'barely you came
before you went</i>

01:10:20.277 --> 01:10:23.277
<i>Before you left away from me</i>

01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:28.156
<i>away with you
up and off you are on the way</i>

01:10:28.356 --> 01:10:31.116
<i>I'll be back and like you sai</i>

01:10:31.276 --> 01:10:34.156
<i>I straighten my back</i>

01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:39.196
<i>I know it's over
there I'm more 'to say'</i>

01:10:39.357 --> 01:10:42.676
<i>You are one of them</i>

01:10:42.837 --> 01:10:46.116
<i>never looking back but forward</i>

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:49.036
<i>I hope that you find home</i>

01:11:25.677 --> 01:11:28.276
Sniff it, fuck!

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:51.556
Taxi!

01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:02.596
<i>In pay cash.</i>

01:12:05.356 --> 01:12:08.596
- Then you're done, child killer!
- What happens?

01:12:19.197 --> 01:12:21.436
Well I don't know at all...

01:12:21.597 --> 01:12:23.916
It is not...

01:12:26.517 --> 01:12:28.396
It's not mine.

01:12:33.036 --> 01:12:36.636
<i>Help me!
I want to call my lawyer!</i>

01:12:36.796 --> 01:12:39.117
<i>Ow, that hurts!</i>

01:12:48.036 --> 01:12:51.237
Think he does.
Try to see here.

01:12:51.396 --> 01:12:55.036
- Show it to Ash.
- Ashes, try to see Glenn.

01:12:55.197 --> 01:12:59.116
- Good ass, anyway.
- It's nicer than his face.

01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:02.116
- Hey, Ash.
- Hi.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:06.316
Thanks for the sweet message. I was
Really touched on what you said.

01:13:06.477 --> 01:13:10.356
- What message?
- Don't, just try to hear. You die.

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:13.276
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:13:13.437 --> 01:13:17.116
<i>I just want to apologize for all that,
I've dragged you through.</i>

01:13:17.277 --> 01:13:21.036
<i>You're the best person,
I've ever met.</i>

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:26.556
<i>You taught me to dare
Trust someone again. Goodbye.</i>

01:13:26.716 --> 01:13:30.796
- Isn't it just sweet?
- How nice. It's just so nuts!

01:13:30.957 --> 01:13:35.637
I was fainting.
It really came from the heart.

01:13:35.796 --> 01:13:39.916
- Shh, he's behind you.
- Yes, behind you he stands.

01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:49.396
- Not, but so!
- oh my God!

01:13:49.557 --> 01:13:51.717
What just happened?

01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:55.437
Hashtag dream prince.
Hashtag summer wedding.

01:13:57.036 --> 01:14:00.396
Please, Ash. Cold bowl for you.

01:14:00.556 --> 01:14:04.996
- With lots of chamber jokes.
- Just eat, Ash.

01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:08.356
Jørn, you haven't
touched your quinoa.

01:14:08.517 --> 01:14:11.037
Sune, won't you first?

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.397
Uh, delicious. Thank you, Sirene.

01:14:14.556 --> 01:14:18.556
I want to bring a bowl
for the siren. And for you, Ash.

01:14:18.717 --> 01:14:20.796
Thank you for taking
so good to us.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:24.636
Where are you cute, Jørn.
And congratulations on the patent.

01:14:24.796 --> 01:14:28.316
Yes, Snacky-Pack.
EFKA has taken 6,000 pieces, -

01:14:28.476 --> 01:14:31.196
- so I can help a little bit
with the bills.

01:14:31.356 --> 01:14:36.716
<i>Today, Bangkok has been arrested
toy giant Phillip Eberfrø.</i>

01:14:36.876 --> 01:14:41.556
<i>Eber seed is targeted for anesthesia,</i>
<i>and bloody fingerprints On the teddy bear</i> -

01:14:41.716 --> 01:14:45.156
<i>- has also led to arrest
of a factory manager.</i>

01:14:45.316 --> 01:14:47.276
- Good.
- Tough world.

01:14:47.436 --> 01:14:51.396
Did you hear about the drug seller who stayed
found in the trunk of a car?

01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:55.236
- Was he caught by a superhero?
- You can call it that.

01:14:55.396 --> 01:14:58.716
- It is self-evident.
- Yes, but it is well done.

01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:03.396
- What does such a person do?
- Yes, wonder what he's thinking.

01:15:03.556 --> 01:15:09.116
<i>The subway systems
ravaged by unknown task thieves.</i>

01:15:09.276 --> 01:15:11.996
<i>Glostrup Police is powerless.</i>

01:15:12.156 --> 01:15:14.076
I think he thinks:

01:15:14.236 --> 01:15:19.236
"If I don't do anything,
so no one does."

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.036
Ashtray, where are you going?

01:15:28.876 --> 01:15:31.516
I'm just going out.
