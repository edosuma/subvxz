01:17.840 --> 01:21.435
Oh, Al, please let me go with you.

01:21.640 --> 01:25.110
Come on, Al, please?
Please? I really, really wanna go.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.595
No! Now, let me explain this
one more time.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.518
This is my vacation.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.792
I work hard all year long alone.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.514
I'm going on my vacation alone.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.712
Be brave, Peg. Be back in a week.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.754
- Goodbye, Al.
- Goodbye, Peg.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.277
Good to get away.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.356
Look at my itinerary.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.989
"Bundy World Tour '92.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.996
Day one: Arrive in New York."

02:10.199 --> 02:13.476
Courtesy of Escape From New York.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.075
Then it's on to the nation's capital
for Happy Hook er Goes to Washington.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.153
- Day two.
- AI...

02:23.360 --> 02:26.750
Peg, you're not allowed to "Al."

02:26.960 --> 02:29.872
There will be no "Al-ing"
for my entire vacation.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.399
I am not here.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.438
Day two: I shall Concorde over
to merry old England...

02:35.640 --> 02:38.950
...for British Babes Need Discipline.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.398
- But, Al...
- Peg, sorry...

02:41.600 --> 02:44.160
...the captain's turned on
the "No Peg" sign.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.232
Dad, don't leave yet.
A terrible tragedy's befallen Kelly.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.193
Sorry. As you can see,
my seat is now in an upright position.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.039
I don't understand. Every time he goes
to the doctor, everything checks out.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.276
Well, it's like when you bring
your car in.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.517
It never knocks and pings
when the mechanic is looking at it.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.994
The minute you get it home...

03:05.200 --> 03:09.716
...it is the same old piece
of backfiring junk it always was.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.675
- And what happened to Kelly?
- Her modelling school closed down.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.078
It seems they moved upstairs and most
of the models can't find it anymore.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.271
Poor Kelly. She must be crushed.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.675
She spent so much time
learning the art...

03:26.880 --> 03:29.314
...of rapidly undressing
and dressing again.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.592
I don't think she learned that
at modelling school, Mom.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.992
Now, Bud, it is not nice
to talk about your sister.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.760
But she's not here,
so I guess it's all right.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.152
- Where is she?
- Where she always goes...

03:44.360 --> 03:45.952
...to contemplate during a crisis.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.755
She's at TV World,
Chicago's finest theme park.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.713
Yes, that's where she went
to contemplate the significance...

03:52.920 --> 03:57.038
...of why Garfield can talk
while Odie speaketh not.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.755
That was a rough six months.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.953
She's probably wandering
around Kung Fu Land.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.596
What if she tries to do
something rash, like think?

04:11.320 --> 04:14.596
Am I truly nothing?
Is this all there is to life?

04:19.640 --> 04:22.632
What's wrong, ducky?
You haven't touched a thing.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.028
I don't blame you.
I'm not hungry either.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.877
What should I do with my life?
I need a sign.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.194
Oh, there's one.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.916
Master, the modelling school's closed
and now I'm lost.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.395
Which path should I follow?

04:46.120 --> 04:50.113
Press button A
for Eastern philosophy.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.594
Press B for last night's
bask etball scores.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.233
Press C if you'd lik e
your own personalized videotape...

04:58.440 --> 05:00.908
...of you pressing C.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.153
You have pressed A,
heavy Eastern philosophy.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.510
My child, remember...

05:10.720 --> 05:13.473
...the wise man can eat no more
with four chopsticks...

05:13.680 --> 05:15.432
...than he can with two.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.791
- Unless he...
- Unless he what?

05:21.160 --> 05:22.718
What, master, what?

05:22.920 --> 05:25.514
Who keeps feeding this duck?

05:26.480 --> 05:29.472
Unless he what?
Tell me before I kill you!

05:29.680 --> 05:33.753
Excuse me. Are you from that
modelling school that closed down?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.674
Yeah, how did you know?

05:36.880 --> 05:41.112
Well, I saw the blonde hair and
the loaf of bread and took a wild guess.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.557
Listen, I have some advice.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.193
Oh, wait, here.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.953
Thank you.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.559
Get a job.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.239
But how, master?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.316
Look, you go to the Personnel office
and ask for an application.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.398
Thank you. You're so much wiser
than the other statue.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.388
That's why I've got a pointed stick
and this bag of doody.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.513
- Dad still on vacation?
- Yes.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.395
And not a postcard,
not a letter, nothing.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.591
Okay.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.672
Dad, this was really cute
when I was about 4.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.230
But after 18 years
of your world cruises...

06:43.440 --> 06:46.796
...I can't help but feel maybe it's time
to stand on a freeway off-ramp...

06:47.000 --> 06:51.915
...with a sign that says, " Mindless.
Will embarrass my family for food."

06:53.480 --> 06:57.268
Bud, come here a second.
Let me explain something to you.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.517
You see, you know that
I'm just sitting here on the couch...

07:00.720 --> 07:02.950
...and I know I'm just sitting here
on the couch.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.472
But you see, son, the rest of the weeks
out of the year, I'm selling shoes.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.350
Ladies' shoes.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.597
Fat ladies.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.078
Very, very fat ladies.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.116
And you know
what fat does best, son?

07:20.320 --> 07:21.799
Fat sweats.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.471
So after selling fat sweat all year,
one needs a little vacation.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.558
So you see, son, if I didn't
think I was enjoying myself here...

07:29.760 --> 07:33.548
...I might one day just run amuck and
destroy everyone and everything I see.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.751
Do I make myself clear?

07:35.960 --> 07:38.315
We'll discuss it
when you get back, Dad.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.952
Hi, Mom. Hi, Bud. Is Daddy
back from vacation yet?

07:47.160 --> 07:50.436
Look around, honey.
Does it look like he's here?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.637
Honey, are you okay?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.717
We heard the modelling school closed.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.638
Several of the mothers have called.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.276
Their daughters are eating Cocoa Puffs
and salt-pork products...

08:02.480 --> 08:05.950
...their weight, much like
their dreams, behind them.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.188
How are you bearing up?

08:08.640 --> 08:11.313
Well, I too was feeling Ionely and lost.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.273
And I too almost buried
my troubles in pork rinds.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.395
But thanks to the advice of two
wise statues, I decided to get a job.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.318
A job?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.634
Oh, my God, the shame.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.348
What will I tell the girls
at the beauty parlour?

08:29.560 --> 08:33.996
Well, tell them if their husbands ever
have time to kill down by the airport...

08:34.200 --> 08:37.715
...they might wanna pop in and see
your little girl at the Nude-A-Teria.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.275
Bud, why don't you go on
and stand over by Dad...

08:45.480 --> 08:49.951
...so when he lands, you can be there
to yell, "Da plane, boss, da plane."

08:55.240 --> 08:59.279
Anyway, you'll be proud to know
that I am now a paid employee...

08:59.480 --> 09:01.277
...of TV World Theme Park.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.990
Kel, I love TV World.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.515
Babes from everywhere
flock to Talk Show Land...

09:07.720 --> 09:09.790
...to see the binge-and-purge
Oprah statue...

09:10.000 --> 09:12.116
...that grows and shrinks
on the half-hour.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.198
You have to get me in for free.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.996
Yeah, sure. I really wanna be
at my new job and hear screams of:

09:18.200 --> 09:21.351
"There's a goose monster
loose in the park."

09:21.560 --> 09:23.710
Is it my fault that every time
I'm at the zoo...

09:23.920 --> 09:26.798
...10 girls happen
to back into my hand?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.949
Anyway, Mom, I have
a really good feeling about this.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.118
I mean, this could be more than a job.
It could be a career.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.153
Finally, a chance to show
what I can do.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.630
Thank you, come again.
Thank you, come again.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.196
Thank you, come again. Thanks again.
Come you...

09:44.080 --> 09:47.470
No. Thank... No. Come...

09:47.680 --> 09:50.956
Oh, who cares? I hate this job.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.390
This isn't even a real job.
What am l...?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.431
"Thank you, come again.
Thank you..."

09:57.760 --> 10:00.274
Thank you, come again.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.114
Where's Dad now?

10:10.000 --> 10:15.154
Well, according to his itinerary,
he's in Casablanca.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.154
Here's looking at you, kid.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.390
I know this must be trying
on you, Mom.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.956
When Dad gets back, I suggest
you take the couch and go on a cruise.

10:31.160 --> 10:36.598
That's okay, Bud. I choose to do
my fantasizing in other places.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.990
But, you know, the one we should
be worried about right now is Kelly.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.510
You know, ever since she's had
this job, she reminds me of someone.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.757
I just can't put my finger on who.

10:50.120 --> 10:55.114
Why doesn't the world explode
into a fiery, pus-filled death.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.635
A fat woman comes to the gate today...

10:59.840 --> 11:04.231
...her muumuu covering what
must've been three or four heinies.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.591
Now, she could exit through a little,
itsy-bitsy turnstile or a huge gate.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.394
Guess which one she chooses.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.870
A line was forming.
So I had to do something.

11:17.080 --> 11:21.358
So I got a tub of butter from the
"Delta Burke Let's Get Big" exhibit...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.589
...and oiled her up.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.197
Then I went over to Star Trek Land,
hot-wired the Enterprise...

11:29.400 --> 11:33.473
...and sent it up where no man
has gone before.

11:38.640 --> 11:42.918
She goes flying like a vegetable
out of Dad's mouth...

11:44.440 --> 11:47.989
...right into The Facts of Life
Fan Club Pavilion.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.589
Thank God it's always empty.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.473
Can somebody give me
a reason to live?

11:53.800 --> 11:56.758
Not a convincing one, no.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.555
Listen, Kel. I know
what'll make you feel better.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.751
You can get me into the park for free.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.474
I do nothing for you, niblet.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.078
I do nothing for anyone.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.273
All I wanna do is just sit and relax.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.550
Who is it she reminds me of?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.751
Thank you, come again.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.235
Thanks. Bye.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.515
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Come again.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.274
Kel. Kel. Get me in.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.513
I'm sorry, but the Shemp job
in Three Stooges Land...

12:43.720 --> 12:45.233
...has already been taken.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.832
Vengeance shall be mine.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.395
Then vengeance can't be a woman.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.752
Now go away. Here comes my boss.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.155
- How's it going, Miss Bundy?
- Fine, Mr. Nielsen.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.319
Excuse me, sir. I just exited the park.
This young lady didn't say goodbye.

13:03.880 --> 13:08.396
The heck you say.
I'm sorry, young viewer.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.390
Just for that, we're gonna give you
a rerun. That's a free ticket back in.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.673
And it'll be a deduction
from Miss Bundy's paycheque.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.756
Well, that almost makes up
for her rudeness.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.274
But I don't think she quite
looks sorry enough for me.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.835
But I do think that me
and the rest of the public...

13:28.040 --> 13:30.031
...would like to see her head shaved.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.748
Well, the modelling school may
be closed, but its spirit must live on.

13:35.960 --> 13:40.238
I will follow its motto:
Smile as if your brain had wisdom.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.477
Smile and go on NutriSystem.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.197
Smile, something, something, smile.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.312
I will not let that wisdom
go to waste.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.078
Hi, Kelly. What are you smiling at?

13:55.280 --> 13:56.838
Nothing. Life sucks.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.835
Well, I just love it here.
I try to come as often as I can.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.635
I just can't get enough
of that Cagney & Lacey exhibit.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.591
That show always made me
wanna cut my hair short...

14:09.800 --> 14:12.758
...and shoot at men with my big gun.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.308
But then again, so did Bewitched...

14:16.520 --> 14:19.114
...and Gilligan's Island
and Green Acres and That Girl.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.630
Excuse me, Mrs. D'Arcy, but if you
don't mind, I'm kind of working here.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.910
It takes all my concentration, okay?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.236
Goodbye. Goodbye.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.358
Pretty cool, eh?

14:30.840 --> 14:34.594
Nothing to be ashamed of. At least
you went out and got yourself a job.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.519
Some people don't even do that.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.199
Here comes one now.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.198
What was it like working
on Happy Days?

14:43.080 --> 14:45.958
I'm telling you, kid,
I was not on Happy Days, okay?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.799
My name is D'Arcy. Jefferson D'Arcy.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.753
- Was that your name on Love Boat?
- Oh, beat it!

14:51.960 --> 14:54.633
Come on. Get out of here.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.994
Damn kids. I can hardly
go out in public anymore.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.191
Well, here she is.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.756
Gee, Kelly, it must be nice
to feel like a responsible adult...

15:08.960 --> 15:11.713
...to finally have a job.
Hey, Marcie, can I have some money?

15:11.920 --> 15:14.593
They have a really nice
TV World T-shirt.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.078
I thought you said the hat
and nothing else.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.238
Well, you got two things.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.869
- Well, I'm paying.
- Well, if that's your attitude...

15:24.080 --> 15:26.913
...I wanna go home right now.
- Why should you go and ruin...?

15:27.120 --> 15:30.317
Wait a minute, Marcie.
If you guys are gonna whine like that...

15:30.520 --> 15:34.308
...why don't you take it on over
to Thirtysomething Land, okay?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.628
Welcome. How are you
enjoying the park?

15:38.560 --> 15:41.199
This young lady just snapped at us.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.234
Well, here's two free passes.
It comes out of her salary.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.592
- Could I have a T-shirt too?
- Sure. Miss Bundy's paying.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.909
Let's come back later
and pick another fight with her.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.669
- I could really use some shorts.
- Well, why can't I have the shorts?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.677
I mean, I have the legs in the family.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.193
Can they walk home from here?

16:07.440 --> 16:10.876
Honey, look, let's not argue
here in Chicago's happiest park.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.956
You're right. Of course.

16:14.160 --> 16:18.950
I know. Let's go to Steven Bochco's
Hall of Failures.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.557
Listen, I hear they're just finishing
the Capitol Critters exhibit.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.469
- Oh, I wanna see Cop Rock.
- I wanna see Hooperman.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.711
Two viewer complaints.
"Tsk, tsk," as we say here in TV Land.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.071
Save your "tsk"
for some other idiot, Nielsen.

16:36.280 --> 16:41.149
I'm qualified for much more
than just standing by an... Ex...

16:41.360 --> 16:43.476
Excite sign.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.150
I can say much more than just
"goodbye." I can say "hello."

16:47.360 --> 16:50.909
I can say "pretty bird." Why, I can say
about four or five different things...

16:51.120 --> 16:54.999
...if given the proper chance.
I want a better job.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.795
So I say to you
what many have said to me before:

16:59.000 --> 17:03.551
Put out or get out.
What do you have to say about that?

17:03.760 --> 17:08.435
Normally, two viewer complaints
would call for your cancellation...

17:08.640 --> 17:13.077
...but come to think of it, we do have
an opening for a vacuous blond.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.992
I'm your man.

17:17.720 --> 17:21.076
Can you feel the excitement, boys
and girls? Here we are at the last stop.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.078
Yes, Commercial Land.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.349
See the disgusting, filthy roaches...

17:27.560 --> 17:30.836
...about to devour that pie
Mom made with love?

17:32.480 --> 17:37.918
I said, see the disgusting, filthy,
yet easily replaced roaches?

17:38.240 --> 17:40.708
Roaches. Roaches.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.710
But hark, who do I hear?

17:48.920 --> 17:53.391
A reasonable facsimile of one of the
stars of your favourite TV commercial.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.398
Yes, kids, the Verminator!

18:03.320 --> 18:07.757
Breathe hot toxic, but safe
for the ozone. Vermin death.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.556
Hasta la vista, buggies.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.037
Hey, would one of you kids
like to ask the Verminator a question?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.832
I would.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.310
Excuse me, Verminator.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.796
Could you tell the kids which backseat
you'll be appearing in tonight...

18:32.000 --> 18:34.798
...should they wanna further
their education?

18:35.960 --> 18:40.829
Bud, please don't do this to me.
My wrath will be terrible.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.032
Does anyone else have a question
for the Verminator?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.633
I see you wear a cape
but no underwear.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.191
Is that so you can more easily change
into your secret identity...

19:02.400 --> 19:05.915
...of a mild-mannered sex toy
for the Navy?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.078
Who would like to be
deputy Verminators?

19:14.280 --> 19:15.759
Me! Me!

19:16.160 --> 19:20.438
Well, I see one last roach
that I just can't quite reach.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.111
He's disguised as a dateless,
bitter little troll.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.634
- That's him.
- Yes, that's right.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.478
Send him to Valhalla!

19:34.240 --> 19:37.516
That's right, kids.
Destroy his evil tentacles.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.271
Tentacles, kids, I said tentacles.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.400
- So how was work, honey?
- Oh, it was great.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.636
You have no idea
of the power of television.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.910
I could get those kids
to do anything.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.429
First, I had them beat up Bud.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.029
Then I had them bring me a burger.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.470
Then I had them beat up Bud again.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.755
The best part is that TV World asked
Bud to come back as King Roach.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.351
Well, here's Bud. My little man.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.438
He looks just cute as a bug.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.709
Isn't it grand? I get to command
his death every day.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.797
Oh, and twice on Saturday.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.835
I have finally found my calling,
to have my brother beaten.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.838
It's just for the summer.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.952
That's what your father said
20 years ago.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.710
Hey, Bud, you know,
if you had one more arm...

20:47.920 --> 20:50.673
...you would have a date
for every night of the week.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.271
That's it. Come on,
put them up. Let's go!

21:01.120 --> 21:04.078
- Come and get it, roach boy.
- Oh, now, kids, please.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.033
Don't you think your father
gives me a big enough headache?

21:07.760 --> 21:11.719
What are you saying, Mom?
That I should just accept this?

21:11.920 --> 21:14.229
That I should just let it ride?

21:14.440 --> 21:19.116
I am a college man
and I demand the respect I deserve.

21:27.080 --> 21:31.471
Well, look, we cannot discuss this now.
We've gotta go pick up your father.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.953
Family, I'm home.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.354
- Daddy.
- Hi, Al.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.074
- We missed you.
- Hi.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.278
You know, it was great. But I haven't
showered in about a week...

21:56.480 --> 21:58.516
...so I think I ought to
get right to bed.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.833
But before I do,
I wanna tell you something.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.315
Let's sit down. Come here a second.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.829
I miss my couch.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.277
That's it. Come on over here.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.593
Now, guys, I had it all.

22:14.800 --> 22:19.191
Romance, intrigue, adventure,
but I learned one thing.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.755
And it's the same the world over.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.909
There's nothing like being home
with a nice normal family.
