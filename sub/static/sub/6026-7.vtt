WEBVTT

00:09.960 --> 00:11.325
Hey, welcome to EndFrame.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.370
Yes, hi. Um, would you just tell your boss

00:14.440 --> 00:17.569
that the CEO of Pied Piper
is here to see them?

00:17.640 --> 00:19.005
That's the company that they ripped off.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.407
Sure. And your name is, sir?

00:21.480 --> 00:22.811
- Erlich Bachman.
- Uh...

00:22.880 --> 00:25.531
No. I'm Richard Hendricks. I'm the CEO.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.731
- Oh. Really?
- Yes.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.444
Why would you assume that he's the CEO?

00:30.520 --> 00:32.807
Well, he's... No reason.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.209
Um, the guys are in a staff meeting
right now, though.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.327
They should be out shortly.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.765
Would you guys
like some water while you wait?

00:37.840 --> 00:39.046
We have four flavors,

00:39.120 --> 00:41.327
and the cartons are made from
locally sourced, organic...

00:41.400 --> 00:43.004
Yeah, we get it. You're funded, so...

00:43.080 --> 00:44.081
They're good.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.531
The market has been
exceptionally volatile lately.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.931
As a result,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.085
many of the very aggressive positions
we took at your specific request

01:00.160 --> 01:02.242
have performed poorly.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.641
Very, very poorly.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.686
Do you understand?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.724
Yeah. Would you fuck her?

01:11.320 --> 01:13.129
If I weren't married, I suppose.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.409
But, Russ, as your business manager,

01:16.480 --> 01:18.482
I need to tell you something,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.320
and you're not going to like it.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.686
At all.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.804
So, what's the plan here, Richard?

01:26.880 --> 01:29.486
We're not gonna, like, fight them, right?

01:29.560 --> 01:32.370
Uh... No, no. I don't... I just...

01:32.440 --> 01:34.010
I mean, we got to do something.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.367
I mean, even if it's just yelling at them,

01:36.440 --> 01:38.090
telling them that
they're not gonna get away with this.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.440
But you know they are, right?

01:39.520 --> 01:41.602
Well, not if I have
anything to do about it.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.364
But you sort of don't.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.444
I support you, Richard,
no matter how futile the effort.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.726
Thanks.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.609
Look who just right-swiped me on Tinder.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.920
Karen.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.126
She's cute.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.010
Says here that she's looking
for a man on the go.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.290
You don't go anywhere.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.249
What, are you getting that res on 4G?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.209
- She's cute, right?
- Wow.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.762
Yoyodyne Wi-Fi?

02:05.840 --> 02:07.729
Oh, that's the company next door.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.122
Why is their Wi-Fi password
saved on your phone, Dinesh?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.690
Huh? Um...

02:12.760 --> 02:14.967
I have a friend who works there.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.007
Friend?

02:16.080 --> 02:18.321
What friend? You don't have any friends.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.246
Maroush Davidson Jones.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.490
Okay, fine. Fine. You got me.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.450
Uh... A couple of weeks back,
I went on a few interviews, okay?

02:29.520 --> 02:30.931
And Yoyodyne was one of them.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.490
Jesus. Back off.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.846
Outed by Wi-Fi.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.843
It was when you said
you were selling to Hooli.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.446
And you know, as soon as
you went with Russ, I blew them off. I...

02:38.520 --> 02:40.204
You know what? Fuck this.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.567
I'm not waiting anymore.
I'm going in there.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.405
Mr. Bachman's walking back to you now.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.720
Uh...

02:46.800 --> 02:48.325
That's not my name.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.129
My name is Richard Hendricks.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.807
Hey, remember us?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.329
Oh! Hey, guys. What's up?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.251
You know what you did.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.051
Okay? I saw your live stream.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.690
Okay? I saw your "algorithm."

03:14.760 --> 03:16.250
That's mine. You stole it.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.881
Stole? We asked you guys
some questions a while back,

03:19.960 --> 03:21.724
and you were very helpful.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.325
See? Look.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.689
These, the photos. These are the photos.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.768
This is proof that you stole it from us.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.571
No, those photos prove
that you gave it to us.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.210
Well, you're stealing it all wrong.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.009
I mean, this is how
you're gonna build the code book?

03:34.080 --> 03:35.684
Honestly? This is bush-league.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.603
And look at all these redundancies.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.648
I mean, look,
if you're gonna build it like that...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.609
- Richard, no.
- Richard.

03:42.920 --> 03:43.921
Uh...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.445
Hey, pen down, Dumbledorf.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.731
Suffice to say...

03:47.800 --> 03:50.326
There is something somewhere on this board

03:50.400 --> 03:52.084
that is gonna strangle you at scale.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.565
Don't write that down. Don't... Stop.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.049
Hear me when I say this.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.928
Your tech is always gonna
be worse than ours.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.001
That's fine.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.761
How is that fine?

04:05.840 --> 04:08.241
'Cause we have a finished platform
and you don't.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.006
Which means we're the only middle-out
company currently in the marketplace.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.367
And that's enough for my sales team.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.165
Your what?

04:19.519 --> 04:21.363
This is our sales team.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.006
Okay.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.691
Hear that sound, buddy?

04:26.760 --> 04:29.570
That's the sound of us
leaving you in the dust.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.241
Gentlemen of the Hooli board, and lady.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.889
Question, what is failure?

04:49.600 --> 04:52.524
To the ignorant
or those in conventional industries,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.285
the recent Nucleus glitch
may seem a failure

04:55.360 --> 04:57.249
purely in the negative sense.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.325
But we, in this valley, all know
that "failures," just like this one,

05:01.400 --> 05:03.050
are really stepping stones.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.367
To bring us the iPhone,
Steve Jobs first had to bring us...

05:07.920 --> 05:09.126
The Newton.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.284
To bring us Facebook,

05:11.360 --> 05:15.081
Mark Zuckerberg also
had to bring us Wirehog.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.446
Before he brought us Digg,

05:16.520 --> 05:21.321
Kevin Rose had to bring us
a whole lot of useless things.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.244
And after Digg as well, for that matter.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.281
The point being,

05:26.400 --> 05:29.768
what those in dying business
sectors call failure,

05:29.840 --> 05:33.845
we, in tech, know to be pre-greatness.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.640
Uh, I'm sorry.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.611
Are you telling us that the disastrous
results of your Nucleus live stream

05:39.680 --> 05:42.047
are a good thing?

05:42.120 --> 05:44.168
No, I'm not telling you that.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.965
History is telling you that.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.088
Please, Gavin, enough spin.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.806
A misstep of that magnitude,
there's no excuse.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.450
It's not like we can tell the shareholders

05:53.520 --> 05:55.443
you've suddenly added new functionality.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.645
Haven't I?

05:58.720 --> 06:00.529
Have you?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.204
We weren't told about this.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.850
Well, if I told you about it,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.129
it wouldn't exactly be a secret function.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.281
Now, would it?

06:08.360 --> 06:09.566
Secret function?

06:09.680 --> 06:13.241
Are you saying you've added something new
to the Nucleus platform?

06:13.320 --> 06:16.688
Imagine, if you will,
a function so game-changing

06:16.760 --> 06:18.808
that its integration into Nucleus

06:18.880 --> 06:22.282
will justify any miscue
in the platform's rollout.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.842
Imagine, if you will,
a function so game-changing,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.968
that its integration into Nucleus

06:30.040 --> 06:34.011
will justify any miscue
in the platform's rollout.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.081
Seriously, imagine it,

06:37.160 --> 06:38.730
and do it quickly.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.928
You were all brought here
to generate moonshots.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.650
I need a moonshot now.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.926
If there's any greatness
in any of you at all,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.604
now is the time to access it.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.444
Please don't disappoint me.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.490
Please, please, please don't disappoint me.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.250
Maybe start after lunch?

06:58.320 --> 06:59.401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.604
Hello? Russ?

07:06.400 --> 07:08.562
- Oh, my God. Is that shit?
- Oh!

07:08.640 --> 07:10.449
Is there dog shit on the floor?

07:10.520 --> 07:11.851
Yes, it's shit.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.046
God!

07:14.360 --> 07:15.600
What happened to your painting?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.043
That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.441
I've got some bad news,
and you're gonna hear it eventually,

07:20.520 --> 07:22.045
so you might as well hear it from me.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.245
Sit down.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.051
My accountant has informed me that, uh...

07:32.440 --> 07:33.930
I'm financially ruined.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.241
Holy shit. How?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.762
Because of a series of bad investments

07:40.840 --> 07:43.730
that my fucking money guy
let me talk him into,

07:43.800 --> 07:47.407
I've managed to lose over $200 million.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.564
But... Wait.
Didn't you start out with $1.2 billion?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.967
I mean, you're not exactly broke, right?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.405
I might as well be.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.248
$986 million?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.360
I'm not a billionaire anymore, Richard.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.327
I'm a nine-hundred-and-eighty-sixionaire,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.687
which isn't even a fucking thing.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.524
I'm out of the Three Comma Club.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.124
Functionally, I'm just like you.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.850
Jesus, fuck, that's depressing.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.210
Right. But you're still,
basically, a billionaire.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.361
Not if you round down.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.920
If you round down, I have zero billion.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.367
Forbes has taken me off
their billionaire's list!

08:22.480 --> 08:24.926
Instead, they'll probably put me on their
close-but-no-cigar list,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.446
which is ironic because
I smoke a fuck ton of cigars.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.249
Why the fuck do I buy so many cigars?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.287
I remember the second I
became a billionaire.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.368
I was ass-naked, sitting right there,

08:37.039 --> 08:39.566
just clicking and refreshing,
clicking and refreshing,

08:39.640 --> 08:40.846
watching my stock rise.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.684
And when it happened, I
popped a rod so fast,

08:43.760 --> 08:45.569
I went blind for a full minute.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.130
Nutted all over those cushions.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.648
I was the king.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.245
Now look at me.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.609
Two shitty fucking commas.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.131
I had to sell my McLaren.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.086
Yeah, but there's a
Maserati in the driveway.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.730
Who gives a fuck?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.768
That has doors that open like this.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.330
Not like this.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.050
Or like this.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.167
So it's all fucked.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.049
Well, it's not all fucked.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.567
You did save $50,000
not paying for the charity ball tickets

09:12.640 --> 09:13.721
that you gave me.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.770
Quite an embarrassing moment
for Jian Yang and I.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.686
What? Richard, listen,
my accountants tell me

09:20.760 --> 09:24.287
I need you to start throwing off cash
as quickly as possible, okay?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.489
But you said generating revenue
was exactly what we shouldn't be doing.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.528
But now that I'm spelling billion with an

09:29.600 --> 09:31.807
I'm saying do the exact opposite.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.882
I need you to come back to me in 24 hours

09:33.960 --> 09:36.088
and bring me a proposal
that turns the entire operation

09:36.160 --> 09:37.764
into a sales-based model,

09:37.840 --> 09:40.002
just like you told me
those assholes over at EndFrame have.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.650
You're gonna dig me out
of this hole, Richard.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.210
- What?
- You said it yourself.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.248
EndFrame is built to grab
a bunch of cash quickly,

09:45.320 --> 09:46.924
and that's what I need.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.882
Dad, where is Mom?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.371
Your mom is with her friend Philippe.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.363
They're in Napa. She's
gonna be a few hours.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.249
These guys are gonna watch you, okay?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.209
Watch out for the dog shit. Okay?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.760
I gotta hit the road.
Daddy's going to Vegas.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.081
Flying in a rented Citation Ultra.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.605
Fuck me!

10:03.680 --> 10:04.681
Hello.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.686
Hey, buddy.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.768
Russ wants us to convert to a sales model?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.205
That's just not possible.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.442
I mean, you saw the size
of that team at EndFrame.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.602
There were 40 people in that room?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.727
Right.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.610
Even if we fired all of the engineers
we just hired...

10:21.920 --> 10:23.604
Looking good.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.966
Keep at it, Claude.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.444
Absolutely. Your jobs are not at risk.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.009
That's very comforting.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.327
Even if we adjusted our workforce

10:37.400 --> 10:39.129
and hired sales people instead,

10:39.240 --> 10:42.483
Service Level Agreements
like that are enormously complex,

10:42.560 --> 10:44.528
they take a huge number of man hours.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.922
There's no way we could
find clients, negotiate terms,

10:48.040 --> 10:51.487
and push deals out the funnel fast enough
to yield real cash anytime soon.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.891
We're just not built for it.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.530
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.924
Oh. Karen posted another photo.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.923
Sending it to you right now.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.050
Wait. Why does it say
"sent from my iPhone" at the bottom?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.929
You just sent this from your computer.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.004
It's so that I seem like
I'm an out-and-about kind of person.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.605
I put that in the signature

11:12.680 --> 11:14.569
and then in the body, I'll write fun stuff,

11:14.640 --> 11:16.847
like, "I'm at the opening
of a secret restaurant."

11:16.920 --> 11:19.844
Or, "I'm watching Jaws
at the pool of an old hotel."

11:19.920 --> 11:22.605
You know, keep it fun, vague, mysterious.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.684
It is a mystery why you think
you'll ever see a woman naked.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.444
Dinesh, do you want a piece of advice?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.568
No, thank you. Okay, I...

11:30.880 --> 11:32.370
I know Karen is out of my league.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.205
Okay? She's practically not my species.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.647
I'm a guppy, and I'm trying
to mate with a dolphin.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.245
You guys are bottom-feeders.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.482
You're like those fish
that swim into other fish's mouths

11:41.560 --> 11:43.210
and eat bacteria off their teeth.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.169
There's no such fish.
You made that fish up.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.401
Okay, it's an analogy.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.131
I'm not gonna debate
the existence of the literal fish with you,

11:49.200 --> 11:51.282
- 'cause it's not relevant.
- Well, good, 'cause it doesn't exist.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.361
That is a real fish.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.643
Why don't you just send emails
from your actual iPhone?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.404
It's all the way in my room.

11:57.480 --> 12:02.691
Wait, so you are trying to convince
this girl that you run half-marathons,

12:02.760 --> 12:06.651
but you won't walk halfway
across this house to get your iPhone?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.171
Basically.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.203
Hi. ls there a... A Russ...

12:19.360 --> 12:20.521
Boy genius, what's up?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.409
Hey, Russ. Uh...

12:22.480 --> 12:25.245
Look, I've run the numbers
50 different ways,

12:25.320 --> 12:27.243
and I just don't know
how I'm gonna convert...

12:27.320 --> 12:29.766
You don't need to know.
I don't pay you to know.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.251
- Know... Know what?
- That's right.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.685
I know, you don't know.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.524
- I don't know what you know.
- No, you don't know,

12:34.600 --> 12:35.806
'cause I figured it out.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.086
And you know what? It's what I do.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.764
- What...
- I put radio on the Internet.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.842
I'm putting the third comma
back into my net worth,

12:40.920 --> 12:42.604
and you don't have to do jack shit.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.284
Thanks. Come on,
let's get some food. I'm starving.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.365
Do you want your...

12:50.840 --> 12:52.285
Richard, hey.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.691
Good to see you again.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.367
What is this?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.885
This is the solution.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.561
They're not a competitor
if you're a part of them, right?

13:01.640 --> 13:02.687
Hmm.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.371
Pied Piper is gonna merge with EndFrame.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.482
I mean, seriously, I'm a genius, right?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.484
Where the fuck are you going?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.005
You're gonna blow this deal.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.320
You cannot be serious.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.767
Those are the guys
who ripped off my algorithm,

13:22.840 --> 13:24.171
which they totally fucked up, by the way.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.486
Okay, so now you can fix it.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.609
You give them a better algorithm,
they'll give you a killer sales team.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.966
And in exchange for bringing you to them,

13:30.040 --> 13:32.088
they give me a big fat buyout
of my stake in your company.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.571
I'm that much closer to re-billionizing.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.449
Mmm. Those guys are clowns.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.000
Clowns with commitments worth millions.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.003
Did you know they have a deal
on the table with Intersite?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.287
Intersite? The porn company? Really?

13:42.360 --> 13:43.441
I know. Awesome, right?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.681
And they've done months of hard work.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.643
All you have to do is show up
and compress shit.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.285
- The answer is no.
- Wrong.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.762
You do this deal, or I pull your funding.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.367
Well, you can't pull funding
because we have a contract, so...

13:54.440 --> 13:56.408
Oh, we have a contract?

13:56.520 --> 13:58.682
We have a fucking contract, Richard?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.489
You wanna know what I have?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.449
Uh...

14:03.480 --> 14:07.041
A fucking car whose doors open like this.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.010
Not like this, not like this.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.001
These are not the doors
of a billionaire, Richard.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.320
FUCK you!

14:26.320 --> 14:28.049
Fuck you in the ass.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.641
So you wanna sue Russ Hanneman?

14:36.720 --> 14:39.121
Yeah. Yeah, we had a contract.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.409
He promised to give us $5 million
and now he's welshing.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.523
And you wanna sue EndFrame?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.523
Yes, because they stole our IP.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.286
Before or after you gave it to 'em?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.328
Okay, we were tricked, so...

14:52.400 --> 14:57.122
Richie, you're not a guy
that should be worried about suing people.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.524
You need to be worried about the guy
at Hooli who's suing you.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.171
If you don't mount a
vigorous legal defense,

15:04.240 --> 15:07.210
then you lose to Gavin Belson by default.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.762
And you are stamped "Property of Hooli."

15:10.840 --> 15:14.162
You let Hanneman walk,
how do you plan on paying these cats?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.163
I just paid them 80 grand.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.004
As a retainer.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.129
That retains them, now you gotta pay them.

15:21.200 --> 15:26.764
Hold on. So I just paid them $80,000
for the right to pay them more?

15:26.840 --> 15:27.841
Yeah.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.605
Fucking lawyers, man, right?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.923
Like it or not, Richie,
you're stuck with Hanneman.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.409
I mean, technically,
it's not even a merger.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.451
EndFrame just absorbs you, and you're gone.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.764
Right. So, basically, we end up
working for EndFrame

15:48.840 --> 15:52.162
after giving them our idea,
which was way better than theirs,

15:52.240 --> 15:54.447
and they end up making more money than us.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.522
Fuck that. Assholes.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.927
Fucking king-sized assholes.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.729
Butt-holes indeed.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.121
What if we didn't do that?

16:03.200 --> 16:06.409
What if, instead, we got
our own client like EndFrame has,

16:06.480 --> 16:07.970
a porn company or something?

16:08.040 --> 16:11.487
That's not really how it works, Gilfoyle.
You can't just go get a client.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.722
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's not that easy.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.211
Why not?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.681
'Cause EndFrame worked
that Intersite deal for months,

16:17.760 --> 16:21.242
kicking every detail of the contract
and SLA back and forth,

16:21.320 --> 16:23.288
promising tons of custom features.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.408
And you can't just make that stuff up.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.201
What if I didn't have to make it up?

16:28.280 --> 16:32.729
What if I had every detail of their deal
on my computer right in front of me?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.245
I'm sorry, um...

16:34.880 --> 16:37.531
Are you just asking what if...

16:37.640 --> 16:39.768
Or do you actually have this information?

16:41.040 --> 16:43.884
Gilfoyle, please don't tell me

16:43.960 --> 16:46.611
that you hacked into EndFrame's system.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.571
Okay. I won't tell you that.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.921
Well, did you hack into it or not?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.128
My feeling is,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.009
if you're the CEO of a company

16:59.120 --> 17:01.646
and you're dumb enough
to leave your login info

17:01.720 --> 17:03.324
on a Post-it note on your desk

17:03.400 --> 17:08.247
while the people that you fucking ripped off are
physically in your office, it's not a hack.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.846
It's barely social engineering.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.809
It's more like natural selection.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.804
Fucking ninja.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.362
Okay, I was not in the room
while this was happening.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.407
This is way over the line.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.608
This is crazy illegal.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.204
We're not trading on stolen information.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.487
- It's not worth it.
- What if it was worth it?

17:26.560 --> 17:28.005
It's not, so...

17:28.079 --> 17:31.129
Gilfoyle, hypothetically,
how much is it worth?

17:31.520 --> 17:33.170
$15 million.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.406
- What?
- Holy shit!

17:34.480 --> 17:37.324
Okay, I was definitely not in the room
while this happened.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.721
I've got it all right
here with a bow on it.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.246
Delivery dates, benchmarks.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.405
They're promising to deliver
high-quality 4K streaming video

17:46.480 --> 17:48.084
at 20 megabits per second.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.766
That's it? That's dog shit.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.283
If we can put a half-decent build
of our platform in front of Intersite,

17:56.480 --> 17:59.051
I mean, we can shark this 15 mil
right out from under EndFrame.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.360
I... I don't understand.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.920
How does Intersite
have all this money to throw around?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.570
It's pornography, Richard.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.087
Adult content has driven more important
tech adaption than anything.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.084
I mean, the first fiction ever published
on a printing press

18:11.160 --> 18:12.491
was an erotic tale.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.403
And from there, it was Super 8 film,

18:14.480 --> 18:17.006
Polaroid, home video,
digital, video on demand...

18:17.080 --> 18:19.765
Credit card verification systems, Snapchat.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.481
Pornography accounts for
37% of all Internet traffic.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.641
38% when I'm on it.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.122
Reducing Intersite server load
by a tiny fraction

18:28.200 --> 18:30.282
could save them tens of millions
of dollars a year.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.441
Hundreds.

18:31.520 --> 18:35.764
$15 million is only like
six hours of Intersite CDN bill, right?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.251
But to us, that...

18:37.320 --> 18:40.642
I mean, we could settle out with Russ,
pay our legal fees,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.121
have plenty of runway to get us to CES.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.043
Minor detail. This is stealing.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.805
You mean like lying and telling someone
that you want to fund their company,

18:47.880 --> 18:49.450
and then taking their tech
when they meet with you?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.648
Like that kind of stealing?

18:51.720 --> 18:54.041
You wanted to do something, Richard.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.770
This is something.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.242
It's time to walk the
left-hand path, Richard.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.970
The statistics here are clear.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.089
Protecting existing revenue streams
in the current climate

19:25.160 --> 19:27.322
is no longer a viable option.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.244
We must run forward
simply to stay in place,

19:30.320 --> 19:34.245
by doing what the adult industry
has always done, lead.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.488
Pioneering cutting-edge interfaces

19:36.560 --> 19:40.281
across new device platforms
like Oculus and iWhack

19:40.360 --> 19:42.681
will be the key to our
survival as an industry.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.730
And based on their recent
investment patterns,

19:45.800 --> 19:48.531
tech leaders such as Facebook agree.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the future.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.211
What is that on your computer screen?
A fractal?

20:06.280 --> 20:09.204
No, it's just pictures of art
I've been sending Karen

20:09.280 --> 20:11.886
from my mobile phone,
which is charging over there.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.407
I told her I just got back from
a gallery opening in Hunter's Point.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.084
Who painted that disappointment?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.090
Jaden, age five.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.731
I got it from his
Montessori school website.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.723
He's not online, he's never gonna find out.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.801
What?

20:24.880 --> 20:26.405
Crimes against children...

20:26.480 --> 20:28.482
Really, so easy to get away with.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.004
Oh, another text from Karen.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.730
"In your 'hood. Can I come over?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.883
"IDK, too soon, question mark."

20:41.520 --> 20:42.646
Fuck.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.489
What's the issue?

20:44.560 --> 20:45.846
This is what you want.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.048
You know, it's...
The place is so dirty right now.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.681
Probably another day
is best for such activity?

20:51.760 --> 20:53.762
Should I tell her I'm out
getting Ethiopian tapas?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.604
I don't see what the problem is here.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.047
She wants to come over,
and she acknowledged that it's too soon.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.088
You've basically done the deed,

21:00.160 --> 21:01.650
which for you is

21:01.720 --> 21:04.087
ejaculating in your own pants
all over your leg,

21:04.200 --> 21:05.884
and then apologizing profusely.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.322
Just maintain eye contact,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.687
light some scented candles
and throw in some Sade.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.649
The early stuff, though,

21:12.720 --> 21:14.961
before her arrangements got too baroque.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.327
Okay, that is sad.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.971
But I can do this. Um...

21:20.040 --> 21:22.691
She would never sleep with a guy
who lives like this.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.325
I don't even know where to start.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.767
Do you guys want to help me
clean up a little bit real quick?

21:27.760 --> 21:29.524
No, don't do that.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.443
- Miss Kendall.
- Yeah.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.607
Excuse me.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.811
I am data compression.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.451
I do data compression,

21:39.520 --> 21:42.490
and I know that, um,
EndFrame is telling you

21:42.560 --> 21:45.040
that they can lower your bandwidth
and storage costs

21:45.120 --> 21:48.408
by delivering your new 4K video stream
at 20 megabits per second.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.246
- Who the hell are you?
- Sorry. I'm Pied Piper.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.163
I am Richard Hendricks of...

21:54.240 --> 21:56.322
- You're the CEO.
- Yes.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.164
- Uh, thank you.
- I saw you at TechCrunch.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.811
How do you know the specs
of my EndFrame deal?

22:03.600 --> 22:04.840
I can't... I don't...

22:04.920 --> 22:06.922
Okay. I don't like this at all,
Richard Hendricks.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.525
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.443
I can save you millions in bandwidth.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.321
My... My algorithm is lossless.

22:13.400 --> 22:18.327
I can deliver the same 4K video
at seven megabits per second, 60 fps.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.683
We are faster and have
a higher quality than EndFrame

22:21.760 --> 22:23.046
at a third of the bit rate.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.929
- Bullshit.
- I can prove it.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.842
Before you spend a dime, let me prove it.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.330
You know I'm on the board of two charities

22:31.400 --> 22:34.563
and a no-kill animal shelter
with Gavin Belson, right?

22:34.640 --> 22:37.120
The man who is suing you
for stealing his IP.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.850
That lawsuit's bullshit.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.964
I have a very complicated
deal in place with EndFrame.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.202
Why should I back out
and take a risk on you?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.125
Back there, you said

22:47.200 --> 22:51.171
that your business needs to do
whatever it takes in order to survive.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.049
Well, so does mine.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.405
And this is it.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.882
If I don't get this deal,
my company is dead.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.401
So this is your place?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.566
Yes.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.007
I know it's weird
that a guy like me would live here,

23:11.080 --> 23:15.005
but, honestly, this is just where I rest.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.363
Out there is where I live.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.408
Did you get my link
to the Catalan animation festival?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.720
Oh, did I?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.161
Where do you stand on
the subtitling v. dubbing debate?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.765
'Cause to me, dubbing is boorish.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.889
'Cause every language,
to me, has its own...

23:34.040 --> 23:35.724
Hey, how'd you get on our Wi-Fi?

23:35.800 --> 23:37.723
How does your phone know the password?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.086
Did it?

23:39.160 --> 23:40.571
Yeah, it connected immediately.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.608
- It's an alpha-numeric...
- Oh...

23:42.680 --> 23:44.489
Long password.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.650
Um... I...

23:46.720 --> 23:50.327
Okay, this is really weird.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.686
Karen?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.321
Erlich. Hey.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.288
I didn't realize that it was you, Karen,

23:59.360 --> 24:01.886
the Karen that Dinesh...

24:02.000 --> 24:03.684
You two know each other?

24:03.760 --> 24:05.444
In a sense. Yeah.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.481
- What...
- Outed by Wi-Fi.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.131
...is the specifics of the "sense"?

24:11.840 --> 24:12.841
Uh...

24:12.920 --> 24:15.446
You never... You never called.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.081
I got super busy.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.527
Hey, we all do.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.571
Well, we should probably
head to the festival, so...

24:28.000 --> 24:31.129
So did you ever find my earrings?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.890
I... I don't know.

24:34.520 --> 24:38.366
Should we check the old lost and found?

24:38.440 --> 24:39.487
Okay.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.607
So, here goes.

24:50.680 --> 24:55.004
By wearing this standard
Hooli earbud headphone,

24:55.080 --> 24:59.165
modified with a small piezoelectric sensor,

24:59.240 --> 25:02.164
the user can control their Hooli phone

25:02.240 --> 25:05.642
solely with their neural impulses.

25:05.720 --> 25:09.167
Point, click, drag, even type,

25:09.240 --> 25:12.130
all using only brainwaves.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.411
Think it and it happens.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.926
Holy shit.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.646
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.210
This is great.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.008
Fuck, yes, team!

25:27.080 --> 25:29.287
So what's our timeline here?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.203
I mean, when can we start testing this?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.887
How long before we can
integrate this into Nucleus?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.405
Not long.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.051
It'll probably happen in our lifetime.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.565
We just have to figure out
how to make it work.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.450
But I really believe that our grandchildren

25:46.520 --> 25:49.808
are going to grow up
taking this technology for granted.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.406
Our grandchildren?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.323
I know you're single, but you know,
you might meet someone.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.323
No. No! No! What...

25:55.400 --> 25:56.970
What do you have that's ready now?

25:57.040 --> 25:58.326
Well, mmm...

25:59.320 --> 26:02.722
Truth be told, we kind of put all
our eggs into this basket.

26:02.800 --> 26:07.408
But we do have
the kick-ass potato cannon, though.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.880
Although, actually, this one is...
ls broken.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.844
We tried to put a Mr. Potato Head in it,

26:13.920 --> 26:16.366
and it did not like that.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.764
Still in there, eh?

26:28.840 --> 26:31.605
What do you think?
Will they ever find those earrings?

26:32.840 --> 26:35.002
Funny thing about lost items,

26:35.080 --> 26:37.686
always in the last place you look.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.084
Thanks for coming in, guys.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.128
I look forward to working with you.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.529
Us, too.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.443
Come on back. This way.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.604
We're right in here.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.091
Hey, Mark.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.370
Good to see you again.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.121
What is this?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.361
This is a bake-off.

26:59.880 --> 27:03.202
I'm gonna give EndFrame and Pied Piper
the same video library to compress.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.406
In a week, I'll review

27:04.480 --> 27:06.608
and award the contract
to whoever does a better job.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.806
What?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.644
- Um, whomever.
- What?

27:10.080 --> 27:13.482
Whomever does the better...
But okay, yeah. Never mind.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.086
Welcome to the left-hand path, my friend.
