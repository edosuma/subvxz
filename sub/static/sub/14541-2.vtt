18:43.331 --> 18:45.413
Is your name even Nate?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.283
No.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.836
I've got orders.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.043
But then Why'd you save me?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.052
AARON:
Maggie, slow down.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.842
- We can still catch up.
- We don't know where she went.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.637
- And we can't hunt, not like she can.
- Aaron, please.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.101
She will find Miles,
but we will never find her.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.312
Not without a GPS.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.148
So we just let her go off
to some militia prison camp?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.405
I'm not happy about this either,
but we'll see her again.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.239
How do you know that, Aaron?
How do you know that?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.579
Just--

19:26.749 --> 19:29.207
You know, we will.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.668
Do you wanna know the reason
why I keep this?

19:39.470 --> 19:43.589
Because somewhere inside
are the only pictures of my kids.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.679
Birthdays, first steps,
their whole lives.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.395
And I don't have a single photo
to hold in my hands.

19:55.569 --> 19:59.608
I spend hours staring
at this stupid thing.

19:59.782 --> 20:04.151
It's getting harder and harder
to remember their faces.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.158
So I'm sorry.

20:13.170 --> 20:18.381
But there's no way of knowing
who we'll see and who we won't see again.

Hey, cap.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.394
I'm pretty messed up, huh?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.779
I'm afraid so, son.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.570
It's die quick or die painful.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.030
That's all you got left.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.323
You drink every drop.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.960
Then you'll sort of drift off,
won't feel a thing.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.795
I'm scared.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.097
Don't be.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.307
Down the hatch, son.

21:21.864 --> 21:26.700
Where you're going,
you'll be warm and rested and fed.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.530
You'll be with your family.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.866
And the best part...

21:31.040 --> 21:35.455
...you'll bask in the brightest,
most beautiful light.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.789
CHARLIE:
Mommy, why are we here?

22:22.967 --> 22:26.176
Daddy had to get some things
from our work. He'll be right back.

CHARLIE:

22:36.438 --> 22:38.304

CHARLIE: Yes.

22:38.858 --> 22:42.271
Me, I love the Bulls, but...

22:42.444 --> 22:44.981
- Probably played their last game, huh?
RACHEL: Charlie?

22:45.155 --> 22:46.316
Charlie, come over here.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.066
- She's beautiful.
- Charlie, come here.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.113
Such a pretty face.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.909
I'd hate to have to smash it in.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.378
I'd like your food, please.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.629
All of it.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.677
You're killing me.
What are you doing here?

23:10.848 --> 23:13.385
- I'm coming with you.
- I told you I'd come find you.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.345
Not good enough.
Let me come with you.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.681
I get it, you want your brother.
You've been--

23:17.855 --> 23:20.563
No, you don't get it.
You need to let me help, okay?

23:20.733 --> 23:23.065
- Why?
- Because it's my fault, Miles.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.693
What are you talking about?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.569
I took care of Danny.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.110
After my mom died, it was me.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.745
He gets these asthma attacks.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.163
So I had to watch him.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.500
I wouldn't sleep for more than
an hour at a stretch.

23:44.673 --> 23:49.713
Checking on him ten times every night
just to make sure he was still breathing.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.091
I didn't let him out of my sight.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.967
Until the day that they took him.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.431
Because I was off pouting
like some brat.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.765
And if I was there,
maybe I could have stopped them.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.901
Maybe my dad would still be alive.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.192
Maybe Danny wouldn't be off scared
and alone.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.824
And if he gets sick, they're not--

24:17.665 --> 24:20.157
Miles, I can't sleep.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.669
You gotta let me help.
I can't just sit there and wait.

24:33.847 --> 24:38.091
Okay, so I have a confession to make.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.148
Ben gave me this.

24:48.445 --> 24:53.064
He said to keep it safe, and to bring it
to a woman named Grace Beaumont...

24:53.242 --> 24:55.324
...in Grant Park, Illinois.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.451
MAGGIE: <i>Who is she?</i>
AARON: <i>I don't know.</i>

25:01.792 --> 25:03.282
Why?

25:03.460 --> 25:04.916
Why her?

25:05.087 --> 25:08.796
Maggie, what if
we could get the power back on?

25:10.175 --> 25:13.634
<i>What if you could go home again?</i>

25:15.806 --> 25:18.013
What if you could see your kids again?

25:31.780 --> 25:35.569
So we take this to this Grace woman
and she does what with it?

25:35.743 --> 25:39.486
I don't know. Ben just said
she knew something about the power.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.451
- This doesn't make any sense.
- But that, that's the thing.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.535
- I think it actually might.
- How?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.872
The blackout,
that doesn't make any sense.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.287
Totally corn-holed the laws
of nature.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.921
And it shouldn't be permanent.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.504
We should be able to fix this,
but for some reason, we just can't.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.796
- But if it were man-made--
- Man-made?

25:57.973 --> 26:00.055
Why would someone do something
like that?

26:00.893 --> 26:04.136
If I'm right, then this is good news.
This is the best news.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.351
- How?
- Because if it's man-made...

26:07.524 --> 26:09.765
...then maybe we can fix it.

You don't like that I killed that traitor
back there.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.770
...and a rebel flag.

Even though he shot one of my boys.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.648
Well, I'll tell you what I think.

26:55.531 --> 27:01.868
I think the Monroe Militia is the
one thing between us and total anarchy.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.131
I think that you tell yourself that.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.879
I think the truth is you like to kill.

27:23.225 --> 27:27.059
Because you're a murderer
