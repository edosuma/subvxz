00:12.142 --> 00:16.584
When there's nothing
to hold onto,

00:16.651 --> 00:19.159
hold onto your faith.

00:19.195 --> 00:20.786
Margaret.
My love.

00:20.901 --> 00:22.403
You're here now.

00:22.470 --> 00:23.454
Isabella.

00:23.521 --> 00:26.086
My brother is not the only one
with royal obligations.

00:26.137 --> 00:28.150
Please have mercy on my son.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.320
I had almost forgotten.

00:31.395 --> 00:32.650
What?

00:32.735 --> 00:34.571
How your eyes appear
by candlelight.

00:37.235 --> 00:40.397
Your Grace,
I present Sir Gawain.

00:40.469 --> 00:41.726
Give me all of it.

00:42.818 --> 00:44.786
King Philip demands
you vacate the Holy See,

00:44.822 --> 00:46.063
but the means
of your removal...

00:46.122 --> 00:47.379
well,
he left that up to me.

02:01.411 --> 02:02.960
Say it!

02:02.996 --> 02:04.090
Say it!

02:04.126 --> 02:05.588
I yield!

02:26.478 --> 02:27.985
Landry du Lauzon,

02:28.021 --> 02:31.374
you have passed
the last initiate ritual.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.018
It is my honor
to welcome you back

02:33.080 --> 02:35.624
into the Order
of Solomon's Temple.

02:44.337 --> 02:46.679
Well done, Brother.

02:56.133 --> 02:58.196
Subtitles by explosiveskull

03:03.089 --> 03:04.799
Fall in!

03:07.644 --> 03:10.987
How long does the cripple
require to ready my men?

03:11.023 --> 03:13.531
To train an entire squadron
against the Templars?

03:13.567 --> 03:16.239
Weeks.
But I assure you, my Lord,

03:16.301 --> 03:18.327
you will not
be disappointed.

03:18.363 --> 03:19.698
See that I'm not.

03:22.492 --> 03:24.119
Move, filth!

03:34.713 --> 03:37.883
By my honor, I will shed
your blood, cripple.

04:09.539 --> 04:12.214
Who is he, father?

04:12.250 --> 04:14.294
The key to my victory.

04:16.838 --> 04:19.998
Alone, you will
not stand a chance

04:20.034 --> 04:21.724
against the Templars.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.853
But together in the name of our
King, we will destroy them!

04:40.529 --> 04:44.205
Dear Heavenly Father,
I pray that tonight,

04:44.241 --> 04:48.995
my body may conceive a healthy
baby in Your Holy image.

04:58.672 --> 05:01.597
I've been waiting
for you.

05:01.633 --> 05:02.984
I was...

05:03.054 --> 05:05.303
Praying for a child?

05:08.306 --> 05:11.184
Perhaps
we could pray together?

05:26.533 --> 05:28.332
O Good St. Gerard,

05:28.368 --> 05:31.502
beseech the Divine Author
of Life

05:31.538 --> 05:34.382
to bless me
with offspring.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.508
That I may raise up
children to God in this life

05:37.544 --> 05:41.384
who will be heirs to his
Heavenly Kingdom in the next.

05:41.431 --> 05:43.472
Amen.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.735
No.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.755
Not tonight.

06:16.791 --> 06:20.092
Please, Louis,
talk to me.

06:31.761 --> 06:35.065
The time for war approaches,
De Nogaret.

06:35.127 --> 06:37.676
Tell Gawain
he has one week.

06:37.712 --> 06:39.553
I will, Your Majesty.

06:39.589 --> 06:43.265
If I may, until the hour
of attack arrives,

06:43.301 --> 06:45.768
I recommend you advance
your legal campaign

06:45.804 --> 06:47.885
against the Templars
by taking advantage

06:47.955 --> 06:51.357
of the fiery rumor they are
murdering infants.

06:51.393 --> 06:55.202
And by doing so, turn all
of France against them.

06:55.238 --> 06:59.165
What makes you so certain
it's rumor and not truth?

06:59.201 --> 07:02.370
Did a Templar
not murder my wife?

07:05.081 --> 07:07.464
I shall hear
their claims.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

07:09.716 --> 07:11.886
An innocent child
murdered.

07:11.922 --> 07:15.014
What
an unimaginable tragedy.

07:15.050 --> 07:17.016
Yes.

07:17.052 --> 07:19.727
And if I might
further suggest,

07:19.763 --> 07:23.355
I would open your audience
not only to the affected,

07:23.391 --> 07:26.274
but for all to hear.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.924
The public deserves
to know the truth

07:28.960 --> 07:31.071
about their beloved
Templars.

07:31.107 --> 07:34.236
And a fire needs wind
to spread.

07:37.781 --> 07:40.367
Initiates, it's time.

07:43.662 --> 07:45.961
Do you request the company
of the house?

07:45.997 --> 07:50.674
Do you promise to be obedient
to the Master of the Temple?

07:50.710 --> 07:54.386
To keep our traditions, to help
conquer the Holy Land?

07:54.422 --> 07:58.091
And to never allow a Christian
to be deprived of his faith?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.428
Yes, Sire, if it please God.

08:02.514 --> 08:08.234
In the name of God and
of Saint Mary and of our Lord,

08:08.270 --> 08:11.662
St. Peter of Rome and our
Father, Pope Boniface,

08:11.698 --> 08:14.962
we welcome you to all the favors
and sufferings

08:15.040 --> 08:16.575
of our brotherhood.

08:16.611 --> 08:18.369
Rise.

08:36.131 --> 08:38.780
Rhone, the merciful.

08:38.817 --> 08:42.451
You are now one
of God's executioners.

08:42.486 --> 08:47.956
May your mercy...
be your swift sword.

08:57.168 --> 08:59.885
I believe
this is yours.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.932
As well as this.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.859
Welcome home.

09:15.929 --> 09:17.979
Thank you,
Initiate Master.

09:18.085 --> 09:19.675
You're a Templar now

09:19.774 --> 09:22.282
and have earned the right
to call me Brother.

10:01.357 --> 10:03.866
The Pope has been murdered.

10:17.042 --> 10:18.719
What say the Heavens?

10:18.843 --> 10:22.895
The Sun aligns
with Mars and Pluto.

10:22.931 --> 10:26.648
Why isn't the gimp
training my men?

10:27.225 --> 10:28.745
I dispatched Gawain
and a few men

10:28.781 --> 10:30.663
to watch the roads
to Rome.

10:30.712 --> 10:32.732
He caught renegades,
my Lord.

10:32.795 --> 10:34.654
Loyal followers
of Pope Boniface

10:34.716 --> 10:37.308
with intent to spread rumor
against you.

10:37.344 --> 10:38.762
Templars?

10:41.506 --> 10:44.265
Leper Knights
of St. Lazarus.

10:44.301 --> 10:45.433
Traitors.

10:45.469 --> 10:47.518
You dealt with them?

10:47.554 --> 10:51.141
Yes, but one
escaped wounded.

10:53.143 --> 10:55.109
I have men
watching the road.

10:55.145 --> 10:57.058
He'll not make it
to Rome alive.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.815
How can you be sure, hmm?

11:02.110 --> 11:06.120
An act by one
is an act by all.

11:06.156 --> 11:11.083
Go to their church
and execute whoever's left.

11:11.119 --> 11:14.829
I will not have false rumors
spread to the steps of Rome.

11:14.865 --> 11:17.214
Am I clear?

11:17.250 --> 11:20.170
Yes, Your Majesty.

11:23.507 --> 11:25.271
I would trust Gabriel
with my life.

11:25.307 --> 11:26.974
Tancrede and I fought alongside
him in the Holy Land.

11:27.010 --> 11:28.330
These are rumors!

11:28.389 --> 11:30.147
The Leper Knights
of St. Lazarus were told

11:30.222 --> 11:32.597
that De Nogaret visited
His Holiness before he died.

11:32.660 --> 11:33.874
These are not rumors.

11:33.929 --> 11:35.608
Pope Boniface was murdered
by the King.

11:35.644 --> 11:39.069
Why would the King's men attack
the Knights of St. Lazarus

11:39.105 --> 11:40.655
if not to silence them?

11:40.691 --> 11:43.405
But Boniface was known
to have many enemies.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.890
Ulric, Philip has attacked
holy warriors like us.

11:46.968 --> 11:47.936
Are we just
going to stand here

11:47.983 --> 11:49.387
and keep on talking
in circles?

11:49.450 --> 11:50.964
As opposed
to using this as a chance

11:51.019 --> 11:52.875
to kill your dead lover's
husband?

11:54.079 --> 11:56.921
Yes, it's true,

11:56.957 --> 11:59.840
Philip is my enemy, but he was
also once my friend.

11:59.876 --> 12:02.192
But, Brothers, we must pick up

12:02.247 --> 12:03.998
where the Lazarus Knights
left off.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.877
We must deliver
a message to Rome

12:05.913 --> 12:07.121
that the Pope
has been murdered.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.376
You would have us
summon an army

12:08.412 --> 12:11.560
against the King
over rumors?

12:11.596 --> 12:14.301
I would
before the King comes for us.

12:14.340 --> 12:16.190
We must protect ourselves!

12:16.226 --> 12:18.663
Grandmaster, you must see
where this is headed.

12:18.733 --> 12:21.779
Yes. Our downfall
should we follow you.

12:21.815 --> 12:24.194
This isn't about
following me.

12:24.249 --> 12:28.411
Brother Templars,
our duty is to the Pope.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.205
We shall wait until the election
of a new one

12:31.241 --> 12:33.031
and obey his instructions.

12:33.067 --> 12:36.064
And in the meantime, we'll send
word of the Pope's death

12:36.100 --> 12:37.878
to the other Templars.

12:37.914 --> 12:39.755
Leave me.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.132
Gabriel.

12:51.136 --> 12:54.645
It's good to see you again,
old friend.

12:54.681 --> 12:56.196
Much has changed
in the five years

12:56.232 --> 12:58.899
since our paths
last crossed.

12:58.935 --> 13:02.695
Even more in the 20
since we've known each other.

13:02.731 --> 13:04.905
Have your brothers
discussed my tidings?

13:04.941 --> 13:08.743
We have.

13:08.779 --> 13:10.081
Gabriel, we will not
ride to Rome

13:10.117 --> 13:12.657
or anywhere
against the King.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.245
Then I will alert
the Curia myself.

13:21.875 --> 13:25.634
20 years ago, the Templars
were men of action.

13:25.670 --> 13:28.256
Have you no sway as Master
of the Paris Temple?

13:31.802 --> 13:35.519
The Paris Temple has fallen
to the King,

13:35.555 --> 13:37.313
and I am...

13:37.349 --> 13:39.815
I'm no longer master
of any temple.

13:39.851 --> 13:42.610
I sinned.

13:42.646 --> 13:45.315
I serve Chartres now.

13:48.568 --> 13:51.619
The King's men
that attacked us...

13:51.655 --> 13:54.330
one of them was
a former Templar,

13:54.366 --> 13:56.415
his leg fixed
in a brace.

13:56.451 --> 13:58.203
I believe he used to ride
by your side.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.715
Gawain.

14:04.751 --> 14:08.070
How does a Holy Knight
fall so far

14:08.133 --> 14:10.507
as to kill
his own brethren?

14:14.845 --> 14:16.060
Rest tonight.

14:16.096 --> 14:17.174
Tomorrow, Tancrede and I

14:17.210 --> 14:18.771
will accompany you back
to your house.

14:24.354 --> 14:26.648
Enjoying
my brother's company?

14:31.820 --> 14:33.786
Margaret?

14:33.822 --> 14:36.288
It's nothing.

14:36.324 --> 14:39.708
Oh, come now,
dear sister.

14:39.744 --> 14:43.671
Look at you.
You're suffering.

14:43.707 --> 14:46.757
You needn't bear
such turmoil alone.

14:46.793 --> 14:48.092
Let me help.

14:48.128 --> 14:52.429
I said the same thing
to Louis last night.

14:52.465 --> 14:55.481
After we tried,

14:55.535 --> 14:57.309
he became distracted.

14:57.345 --> 14:59.228
Oh.

14:59.264 --> 15:02.951
Well, better that
he try and fail

15:03.014 --> 15:05.401
than care not
to try at all.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.477
If only it
were that simple.

15:07.540 --> 15:12.366
Until I produce an heir,
I'm replaceable.

15:12.402 --> 15:15.286
Trapped,
like your bird.

15:15.322 --> 15:17.658
Trapped?

15:17.728 --> 15:20.457
Don't be mistaken,
dear sister.

15:20.493 --> 15:23.127
Romulus is far
from trapped.

15:23.163 --> 15:24.623
Watch.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.516
You worry
over your future,

15:45.586 --> 15:48.113
but soon, you'll have
many children.

15:48.168 --> 15:49.193
Thank you, Gautier.

15:49.229 --> 15:51.604
You can live out your days
as a happy mother

15:51.640 --> 15:53.240
while I, on the other hand,

15:53.276 --> 15:54.865
will be shipped off
to England,

15:54.928 --> 15:56.311
where my maternal destiny

15:56.347 --> 15:58.535
lies in the codpiece
of a sodomite.

15:58.606 --> 15:59.705
You exaggerate.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.332
I do no such thing.

16:01.368 --> 16:03.709
You will be
Queen of France,

16:03.745 --> 16:07.463
and I will be Isabella,
Queen of the quagmires.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.542
What are we going to do?

16:11.169 --> 16:13.510
Whatever we must.

16:18.468 --> 16:19.886
Hyah!

16:24.641 --> 16:28.108
You know, lepers
were anointed by God

16:28.144 --> 16:29.610
to suffer
in Christ's name.

16:29.646 --> 16:31.779
That's why
it hurts so much?

16:31.815 --> 16:33.280
It's why
we give them alms.

16:33.316 --> 16:34.573
You're wrong.

16:34.609 --> 16:35.991
Their curse
is God's punishment

16:36.027 --> 16:38.702
for poisoning wells
and murdering children.

16:38.738 --> 16:40.579
They bear
the mark of Cain.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.331
What are you
so afraid of, Rhone?

16:42.367 --> 16:44.217
You've been spouting your
novena prayer every day

16:44.318 --> 16:46.585
so you don't die
an unnatural death.

16:46.621 --> 16:50.089
Can't you just give them a big
old kiss, see, like this?

16:50.125 --> 16:51.595
It's nothing
to jest about, Kelton.

16:51.658 --> 16:55.177
My sister was killed
by a leper...

16:55.213 --> 16:57.263
...when she
was 5 years old.

16:57.299 --> 16:58.839
My father sent her
into the woods

16:58.917 --> 17:00.232
to forage for berries.

17:00.295 --> 17:02.818
That night, a leper
returned her to our home,

17:02.854 --> 17:04.686
carrying her in his arms.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.856
Hours later, a fever
took her, and she died.

17:07.892 --> 17:12.736
Well, she died of fever,
not leprosy.

17:12.771 --> 17:14.696
Seems hard
to blame the leper.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.115
No, it doesn't.

17:16.151 --> 17:18.409
It was the leper's fault.
They're diseased.

17:18.444 --> 17:22.268
He snatched her
and made her sick,

17:22.329 --> 17:23.641
and then when he was done
with her,

17:23.704 --> 17:25.415
he returned her
to her family

17:25.452 --> 17:27.626
so that we would have
to watch her die.

17:27.662 --> 17:32.756
That monster should have died
for what he did to Lora.

17:32.792 --> 17:35.551
They all should.

17:37.041 --> 17:40.347
Well, I believe all men
are equal before God.

17:40.383 --> 17:43.611
Well, they are not men,
Vasant.

17:43.658 --> 17:45.096
They are monsters.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.731
Who are soldiers
of Christ

17:48.767 --> 17:51.066
and must be regarded as such.

17:51.102 --> 17:53.569
Come, you are Templars now,

17:53.605 --> 17:57.025
and there's a task I would have
your assistance with.

18:01.154 --> 18:03.114
Make way. Move.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.545
Tell them
what you told me.

18:22.592 --> 18:28.520
White cloaks,
red crosses.

18:28.556 --> 18:30.481
Templars.

18:30.517 --> 18:33.108
They came to our home.

18:33.144 --> 18:35.736
They killed my husband.

18:35.772 --> 18:40.616
They took my baby
from my arms, my son,

18:40.652 --> 18:42.743
and they slit
his throat!

18:45.115 --> 18:46.991
Imagine the pain.

18:49.994 --> 18:54.463
Your Majesty...

18:54.499 --> 18:56.209
help me.

19:04.592 --> 19:06.642
The Templars
will pay for this.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.967
On my honor,
as your King,

19:08.003 --> 19:10.979
they will suffer
as you have suffered.

19:11.015 --> 19:13.384
All those who have suffered
at the hands of the Templars

19:13.455 --> 19:16.652
will be compensated
with coin and bread!

19:16.688 --> 19:17.701
Thank you, My Lord!

19:17.748 --> 19:19.196
God bless Our King!

19:19.232 --> 19:22.080
God bless King Philip!

19:22.127 --> 19:25.572
They must burn in Hell,
and you alone are the one...

19:33.830 --> 19:35.671
What?

19:35.707 --> 19:37.005
It is you!

19:37.041 --> 19:38.856
Prince!
Prince Louis!

19:38.942 --> 19:39.696
You're the one who...

19:39.732 --> 19:41.510
Shh! Shh!

19:41.546 --> 19:43.258
I know.

19:43.328 --> 19:45.639
And I am
my father's right hand.

19:45.675 --> 19:51.937
And I promise you, the Templars
will be dealt with accordingly.

19:51.973 --> 19:56.358
This poor woman is hysterical
due to unimaginable loss!

19:57.218 --> 19:58.906
But I give you my word,

19:58.992 --> 20:03.490
you will have
the King's justice.

20:03.526 --> 20:05.617
And then
you shall have peace.

20:06.696 --> 20:08.370
Shh, shh, shh.

20:26.412 --> 20:27.754
I heard
you were escorting

20:27.802 --> 20:29.623
our Lazarus Brother home.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.179
Thought we might aid
in the endeavor.

20:32.240 --> 20:37.168
Brothers Rhone, Kelton, Vasant
to ensure your safe passage.

20:37.274 --> 20:38.316
Brothers.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.697
Thank you, Brother Talus.

20:42.733 --> 20:44.741
Hurry up!

21:01.961 --> 21:04.296
Bless you.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.557
Poor souls.

21:09.593 --> 21:12.352
Those affected
come for our alms.

21:12.388 --> 21:14.724
They stay because there's
nowhere else to go.

21:17.435 --> 21:18.936
Bless you, Templar.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.514
I'm blessed to be part
of the Brotherhood again.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.759
Something that would never
have come to light

21:26.795 --> 21:29.411
- without you, Brother.
- Glad to have you back.

21:29.447 --> 21:32.191
But you never would have
been a Templar again

21:32.227 --> 21:34.708
if you'd have died
fighting the Luciferians

21:34.744 --> 21:36.126
as you'd intended.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.420
Do not seek redemption
and then throw it away

21:38.456 --> 21:40.463
when it is within arm's
reach, Brother.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.841
I was lost,
disconnected.

21:42.877 --> 21:45.760
Your daughter
would have been alone.

21:45.796 --> 21:48.596
It was a mistake.

21:48.632 --> 21:51.719
I'm guilty of many.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.562
Well, you're not alone
in that.

21:59.018 --> 22:02.902
A woman from my past has
come back into my life.

22:02.938 --> 22:05.822
And with her, the feelings
I once held.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.907
We were to be married,

22:07.943 --> 22:12.036
live out our days
on a modest barley estate.

22:12.072 --> 22:15.582
But God's led her
to become a nun,

22:15.618 --> 22:18.659
and in doing so,
she showed me my own path

22:18.695 --> 22:21.463
to a life
dedicated to God.

22:21.499 --> 22:24.883
In quiet moments, I often
dream of a life with her,

22:24.919 --> 22:28.172
the life
we walked away from.

22:29.965 --> 22:32.348
But what I seek
is impossible.

22:32.384 --> 22:35.054
It's an impossible
dream.

22:36.472 --> 22:40.231
I too share that feeling
when I think about Eve.

22:40.267 --> 22:42.025
You miss her?

22:44.313 --> 22:47.197
With all my heart.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.324
Well, I'm glad
to have you back, Brother,

22:49.360 --> 22:51.910
if only to share
in my misery.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.917
Thank you
for accompanying me.

22:58.953 --> 23:03.463
It is I who should be thanking
you for your company.

23:03.499 --> 23:05.840
And your ears.

23:05.876 --> 23:07.566
And your warmth.

23:07.629 --> 23:10.303
It's been
a most welcome gift.

23:10.339 --> 23:11.610
You prefer it

23:11.673 --> 23:15.016
to being called a shrew
on your wedding day?

23:15.052 --> 23:17.143
You were very young.

23:17.179 --> 23:19.729
I was very drunk.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.899
You're very drunk now.

23:25.312 --> 23:27.445
You're right to worry
about the future.

23:27.481 --> 23:31.110
France is not always
kind to queens.

23:32.653 --> 23:35.495
But my brother
loves you,

23:35.531 --> 23:37.039
and he doesn't
love easily,

23:37.075 --> 23:39.791
nor is it required
in marriage.

23:39.827 --> 23:41.876
Trust me.

23:43.330 --> 23:46.464
If he didn't love you,
I would know.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.127
And I would tell you.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.007
To sisters.

23:55.175 --> 23:56.802
To sisters.

24:17.156 --> 24:22.041
Do you see the leaves
dancing in the breeze?

25:12.503 --> 25:17.549
Brothers, welcome
to the Church of St. Lazarus.

25:21.637 --> 25:23.912
Thank you
for this meal, Gabriel.

25:23.987 --> 25:25.784
A generous meal indeed.

25:25.870 --> 25:27.175
Thank you
for escorting me here safely

25:27.211 --> 25:28.729
so that I could enjoy it.

25:30.479 --> 25:31.515
Brother Gabriel,

25:31.551 --> 25:35.085
need you wear that mask
in your own house?

25:35.159 --> 25:38.168
Yes, for your sake.

25:38.696 --> 25:40.989
That's gracious of you.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.579
Please, this is your home.

26:10.310 --> 26:12.187
Fish?

26:19.361 --> 26:21.238
Thank you.

26:24.437 --> 26:27.529
If she
survived, so can we.

27:34.428 --> 27:35.852
Welcome, Brother.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.813
I didn't mean
to startle you.

27:38.849 --> 27:40.017
Theophile.

27:41.644 --> 27:43.194
The hymns.

27:43.249 --> 27:45.320
They sounded very good.

27:45.356 --> 27:47.989
I'm surprised.

27:48.025 --> 27:51.409
We praise God
with clean hearts.

27:51.445 --> 27:54.370
I suggest you learn
to do the same.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.955
What are you doing?

27:55.991 --> 27:59.167
Filling
our lamps with oil.

27:59.203 --> 28:03.171
Believe it or not,
we do need illumination.

28:03.207 --> 28:06.132
How do you live
amongst them

28:06.168 --> 28:08.504
without catching
their affliction?

28:10.089 --> 28:12.847
Can't catch
what I already have.

28:13.949 --> 28:14.733
You're a...

28:14.795 --> 28:17.268
Leper?
Afraid so.

28:17.304 --> 28:20.855
And you're a Templar.

28:20.891 --> 28:25.271
You're not very brave
for a Templar, are you?

28:27.439 --> 28:29.697
We're sending
another messenger to Rome.

28:29.733 --> 28:31.626
Hopefully
he can go unnoticed

28:31.682 --> 28:33.231
as a simple leper beggar

28:33.362 --> 28:35.281
and alert
the Papal Authority.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.541
Gabriel.

28:39.577 --> 28:41.495
How fare
your wife and son?

28:43.673 --> 28:46.056
My wife
and my elder son, Victor,

28:46.092 --> 28:48.308
still live
on my family lands.

28:48.344 --> 28:50.946
Victor has grown strong,
handsome,

28:51.071 --> 28:52.812
and even taller
than me now.

28:52.848 --> 28:53.816
Impossible.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.824
You have a family?

28:56.860 --> 28:59.953
I acquired this
wretched disease,

28:59.989 --> 29:04.123
but rather than hide away
and risk infecting them,

29:04.159 --> 29:06.876
I joined the Order
of St. Lazarus,

29:06.912 --> 29:08.877
seeking a purpose.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.249
They still visit?

29:12.234 --> 29:15.118
It's the happiest day
of my year.

29:15.154 --> 29:20.290
But I can see my absence
has taken its toll.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.168
I am becoming
a distant memory.

29:23.204 --> 29:25.774
Just as my flesh
is withering away,

29:26.555 --> 29:30.066
so, too, is my son's memory
of his father.

29:30.102 --> 29:34.112
Is there no way
you can be together?

29:34.148 --> 29:38.074
That would require
a miracle.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.494
And until that happens...

29:41.530 --> 29:44.372
my desires...

29:44.408 --> 29:48.120
Are impossible.

29:50.306 --> 29:53.440
God forgive me.

29:53.476 --> 29:56.854
God forgive us all.

29:59.556 --> 30:04.150
My father demands
so many things from me.

30:04.570 --> 30:08.037
Terrible things.

30:10.101 --> 30:13.360
You couldn't imagine
the pressure.

30:13.537 --> 30:17.030
Like the... the weight
of every stone in our kingdom

30:17.119 --> 30:19.828
has been laid atop my chest.

30:19.927 --> 30:22.194
The burden is...
is unrelenting.

30:22.230 --> 30:25.781
I cannot move.
I cannot breathe beneath it.

30:26.008 --> 30:29.767
And if I cannot move,
how... how can I serve him, hmm?

30:29.803 --> 30:31.777
Or make him proud,

30:31.816 --> 30:35.064
or give him the heir
he so desperately desires?

30:35.100 --> 30:37.477
And how would an heir
ease his mind?

30:37.539 --> 30:40.814
His... his hatred for my mother
consumes him.

30:44.068 --> 30:50.866
Every day I fail to become
a father, I fail my own.

30:56.705 --> 30:58.644
If I can't sire a child,

30:58.709 --> 31:02.709
then we may as well
all be burned alive.

31:19.032 --> 31:20.992
I've tried everything.

31:23.995 --> 31:28.088
I thought the blood would work,
but it hasn't.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.296
Nothing has.

31:42.551 --> 31:45.060
What remains
of your child.

31:48.224 --> 31:50.482
There is no greater pain

31:50.518 --> 31:53.985
than that of a child being
separated from his mother.

31:54.021 --> 31:55.773
I took him from you.

31:59.735 --> 32:02.243
You are reunited.

32:03.657 --> 32:06.831
I only wish I could be reunited
with my mother, too.

32:51.604 --> 32:54.232
You miss your child.

32:56.984 --> 33:00.204
Yes.

33:00.279 --> 33:04.411
I know
that she's better off,

33:04.468 --> 33:07.252
but being away
from her...

33:07.325 --> 33:09.208
It lays on your soul.

33:09.330 --> 33:14.655
No child is better off
without its father.

33:14.878 --> 33:16.677
But I'm a Templar.

33:16.713 --> 33:19.938
And yet you are a father,
as well.

33:20.005 --> 33:22.096
You cannot
undo your past.

33:22.218 --> 33:24.231
You can only learn
from it.

33:24.288 --> 33:27.255
I cannot associate with her
for her sake.

33:27.432 --> 33:29.815
And mine.

33:29.851 --> 33:31.316
I will be banished again.

33:31.352 --> 33:36.864
No. The man that was banished
no longer exists.

33:36.900 --> 33:41.493
Landry,
you have been reborn.

33:41.529 --> 33:43.620
You're her father.

33:43.656 --> 33:46.456
You're all she has
in this world.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.749
Protect her.

33:52.332 --> 33:54.131
Brother at the door!

34:09.724 --> 34:12.690
- No!
- Royal guards!

34:41.297 --> 34:43.847
Aah!

34:52.475 --> 34:54.065
Come on!

35:02.593 --> 35:04.178
Shut the door!

35:07.390 --> 35:08.563
Brace the doors!

35:19.777 --> 35:22.869
What is it?

35:22.905 --> 35:24.866
Gawain.

35:34.042 --> 35:37.134
Alain, get rid of this door.

35:37.170 --> 35:38.802
Right away, sir!

35:38.838 --> 35:40.512
Bring in the ram!

35:42.675 --> 35:44.822
Knights of Saint Lazarus!

35:44.892 --> 35:47.811
For your attempt to raise arms
against King Philip,

35:47.847 --> 35:51.594
you are now declared
enemies of France!

35:51.657 --> 35:55.444
Along with everyone you harbor!

35:55.480 --> 35:58.107
Including the Knights Templar!

36:10.385 --> 36:12.893
Thank you
for saving my life.

36:13.039 --> 36:14.763
Did you think I wouldn't

36:14.817 --> 36:16.882
because I'm an evil,
heartless leper witch?

36:16.918 --> 36:19.051
No, of course not.

36:19.087 --> 36:21.178
I didn't think you would
because I was an ass.

36:25.176 --> 36:28.060
Are those
all your weapons?

36:28.096 --> 36:29.804
We're not accustomed
to spilling blood

36:29.840 --> 36:31.383
in a house of Christ.

36:31.446 --> 36:32.851
Be grateful
we have this many.

36:32.915 --> 36:34.714
We should bring
the fight to them.

36:34.852 --> 36:36.818
Instead of waiting
for the inevitable.

36:36.854 --> 36:38.969
I count 20 men on this wall.

36:39.032 --> 36:40.697
That's 50 total.

36:40.733 --> 36:41.933
They'll slaughter us one by one

36:42.003 --> 36:44.785
with archers trained
on the door.

36:44.821 --> 36:47.204
We'd be fools.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.460
Unless they want us
alive.

36:48.515 --> 36:52.250
I'll give my life
before I'll be taken prisoner.

36:52.286 --> 36:53.788
Never again.

37:06.717 --> 37:09.428
Gabriel.

37:11.722 --> 37:14.107
I'm sorry, Landry,
for all of this.

37:14.143 --> 37:15.717
I never should have
involved the Templars.

37:15.753 --> 37:17.567
We've always fought
side by side.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.354
Tonight we'll die
side by side.

37:19.390 --> 37:20.776
It won't come to that.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.739
You've seen how many men
there are.

37:22.775 --> 37:24.367
We've no way out.

37:24.403 --> 37:26.660
God will provide us
with a way.

37:26.696 --> 37:28.245
He always does.

37:30.700 --> 37:33.291
- Take cover!
- Shields!

37:33.327 --> 37:34.952
Shields!

37:34.988 --> 37:36.336
Landry!

37:38.749 --> 37:40.465
Put it out!

38:01.689 --> 38:03.733
Sand, quickly!

38:07.695 --> 38:09.119
Gabriel!

38:09.155 --> 38:12.122
God has provided us
with an answer!

38:12.158 --> 38:13.582
Harder!

38:16.954 --> 38:19.248
Move. Move.

38:22.418 --> 38:24.217
Again!

38:24.253 --> 38:27.179
Again!

38:44.557 --> 38:45.898
Stop!

39:16.965 --> 39:19.092
Swords!

39:42.336 --> 39:44.748
Ugh!

40:06.389 --> 40:08.939
Gawain!

40:29.120 --> 40:31.086
Gawain!

41:51.395 --> 41:56.614
Forgive me
for how I reacted before.

41:56.684 --> 41:59.449
Of course.

41:59.536 --> 42:01.105
You know you can tell me
anything.

42:01.141 --> 42:03.100
I know, and I will.

42:03.965 --> 42:06.223
From now on.

42:10.888 --> 42:13.015
What's happened to you?

42:14.924 --> 42:18.683
I'm no longer burdened
by troubled thoughts.

42:43.047 --> 42:44.757
You have
a clean heart, Rhone.

42:51.954 --> 42:53.837
Where will you go now?

42:53.873 --> 42:55.666
To our Grandmaster in Boigny.

42:59.170 --> 43:01.470
Thank you
for standing with us.

43:01.506 --> 43:03.545
We will always
answer your call, Brother.

43:03.607 --> 43:05.108
As we will answer yours.

43:18.106 --> 43:19.988
Time to say goodbye.

43:20.066 --> 43:21.730
I was saying goodbye.

43:21.801 --> 43:24.493
Not to her, half-wit.
To me.

43:24.529 --> 43:26.452
Where are you going?

43:26.515 --> 43:28.663
To alert
the other temples.

43:28.699 --> 43:30.042
We must prepare.

43:30.097 --> 43:32.299
Last night was
only the beginning.

43:32.338 --> 43:35.608
A storm is gathering, and I plan
to be ready before it breaks.

43:35.644 --> 43:37.130
We are at war.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.674
We must return
to Chartres at once.

43:39.710 --> 43:43.220
No. Vasant, Kelton,
and Rhone will go.

43:43.256 --> 43:44.648
You go see your daughter

43:44.684 --> 43:47.860
before King Philip removes
the chance from your hands.

43:48.195 --> 43:49.863
I'll take you where
you need to go, Brother.

43:52.640 --> 43:56.483
Farewell, my Brothers.
You're Templars now.

43:56.519 --> 44:00.821
I expect you to act with swift
justice and kill the same.

44:32.597 --> 44:34.813
Something wrong,
my dear?

44:34.849 --> 44:37.643
Absolutely nothing.

44:47.737 --> 44:49.405
What is the meaning
of this?

44:52.658 --> 44:55.059
What's happened?

44:55.113 --> 44:57.043
Landry.
