00:00.038 --> 00:02.630
There's a potential opportunity
for some acquisitions.

00:02.641 --> 00:04.027
Local TV?

00:04.038 --> 00:05.450
No one watches TV, Dad.

00:05.461 --> 00:07.606
Why shouldn't we do all the news?

00:07.617 --> 00:09.273
ROMAN ROY:
Well, Kim Jong-Pop,

00:09.284 --> 00:11.398
because that's not how
things work in this country.

00:11.659 --> 00:13.482
It's really happening!
We're getting married.

00:13.492 --> 00:15.492
That is a very romantic way
of looking at a prenup.

00:15.784 --> 00:17.858
He's actually acting kind of strange.

00:17.869 --> 00:20.185
- Like inviting me to Thanksgiving?
- Dad?

00:20.196 --> 00:22.274
He kept pouring,
and it just went everywhere.

00:22.284 --> 00:24.023
- It was like he didn't even see.
- ROMAN: Dad! Hey! Whoa!

00:24.034 --> 00:25.983
TOM WAMSGANS: All you have to do
is do a little bit of shredding.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.315
Don't make it a big deal.
It's okay. It's a job.

00:28.325 --> 00:31.149
Shooting bolts into cows' heads
is a job, but I... I...

00:31.159 --> 00:32.951
It's not how I wanna spend
my Thanksgiving.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.743
You just invited me
into the chicken coop.

00:36.284 --> 00:38.617
I'm gonna eat you all.
One by fucking one.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.524
I wondered if you could do me a favor.

00:40.534 --> 00:42.315
Well, that might cause
some ethical issues,

00:42.325 --> 00:44.816
'cause there's a world
where my guy and your gal

00:44.826 --> 00:47.159
ends up wrestling
for the Democratic nomination.

00:47.826 --> 00:49.242
You lost, Grandpa.

00:49.826 --> 00:51.484
- (ALL CLAMORING)
- MAN: Are you all right?

00:51.495 --> 00:53.396
KENDALL ROY:
Take your hands off him, okay?

00:53.451 --> 00:54.701
I've seen all I need to see.

00:54.951 --> 00:58.034
- So, are we doing this?
- Don't ask me. He's your father.

00:58.534 --> 00:59.868
I'd be doing it for him.

01:07.075 --> 01:09.816
This is fucking impressive.
You hooked this shit up, friend.

01:09.826 --> 01:13.149
Hey, brother, I just wanna say
you killed that shit.

01:13.159 --> 01:15.482
My man. Absolutely killed that.
For sure.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.607
What's up, bro? Good to see you.

01:17.617 --> 01:20.315
You're fuckin' imperial right now, OK?

01:20.325 --> 01:22.733
I think American Diablo
is your best album.

01:22.743 --> 01:24.983
Thanks, guys. Much obliged.

01:24.993 --> 01:27.149
All right, man. All right...

01:27.159 --> 01:29.983
Are we supposed to follow him?

01:29.993 --> 01:32.034
- What's gonna happen?
- Just be cool.

01:33.659 --> 01:36.743
So, this guy's your boy, right?

01:38.117 --> 01:40.399
Yeah. Hey, listen, can I
talk to you about something?

01:40.409 --> 01:41.649
- Mm-mm, sure.
- Um...

01:41.659 --> 01:43.399
Oh, here she comes. What's up?

01:43.409 --> 01:45.482
So he's just decompressing, apparently,

01:45.492 --> 01:47.315
but he's really down to connect.

01:47.325 --> 01:49.941
Oh, he's decompressing?
What from his voyage

01:49.951 --> 01:52.024
to the bottom of the fuckin' rap ocean?

01:52.034 --> 01:54.065
- His show was a shitty show.
- (LAUGHING)

01:54.075 --> 01:56.566
But the label got a room for you guys.

01:56.576 --> 01:59.232
- Right here.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?

01:59.242 --> 02:00.524
- Jess.
- Jess. Sorry.

02:00.534 --> 02:01.983
Can you just remind him

02:01.993 --> 02:03.524
he's the guy that owns the company

02:03.534 --> 02:05.190
that owns the company
that owns the label

02:05.200 --> 02:06.899
- that pays his fucking ass?
- Absolutely.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.899
Yeah, just don't say those words.

02:08.908 --> 02:10.533
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

02:11.617 --> 02:13.232
Shrimp. Huh?

02:13.242 --> 02:14.566
Look at this.

02:14.576 --> 02:16.774
Warmed in this airless box for like,

02:16.784 --> 02:18.482
what, let's say six hours?

02:18.492 --> 02:21.566
And this goo?
Is this delicious fucking goo?

02:21.576 --> 02:23.024
Look at that. Mmm!

02:23.034 --> 02:25.482
So, listen, I need to say something,

02:25.492 --> 02:27.190
but once I've said it I'll have said it,

02:27.200 --> 02:30.274
and while it's not a big deal,
it's delicate.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.135
- What is it? You fucked the company?
- I haven't fucked the company.

02:35.451 --> 02:37.607
- Scientology? What is it?
- Look, we're friends,

02:37.617 --> 02:39.357
we go back, I can trust you.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.649
Right?

02:40.659 --> 02:41.983
No.

02:41.993 --> 02:45.441
Sure, but on money stuff,
I can trust you?

02:45.451 --> 02:47.024
No.

02:47.034 --> 02:51.451
Because we're calling a vote
of no confidence on my dad.

02:52.617 --> 02:54.274
What the fuck, man.

02:54.284 --> 02:55.858
It's the best way forward right now.

02:55.868 --> 02:57.816
This is fucking terrible.

02:57.826 --> 02:59.190
Bro, you're gonna fuck the company.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.816
You're fucking with my money, Ken.

03:00.826 --> 03:03.024
Look, I'm telling you,
it's just cleanest.

03:03.034 --> 03:04.190
He's lost it.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.274
He's going to D.C. tomorrow

03:06.284 --> 03:08.024
to piss away our political capital

03:08.034 --> 03:10.065
and position us permanently
in a dying sector.

03:10.075 --> 03:11.816
- Do you think you can win?
- Of course.

03:11.826 --> 03:14.691
It's finished. I'm informing
you, not courting you.

03:14.701 --> 03:16.899
Because I have to work
with whoever's left.

03:16.909 --> 03:18.367
Right. With me.

03:19.868 --> 03:22.733
So are we good?

03:22.743 --> 03:24.649
Can I count on your vote
for Team Future?

03:24.659 --> 03:27.232
I can promise you that I am spiritually

03:27.242 --> 03:29.482
and emotionally and ethically

03:29.492 --> 03:32.441
and morally behind whoever wins.

I'm pissed because
I have to come down to him

05:08.826 --> 05:11.149
like a fuckin' FedEx guy.
Why can't he come to us?

05:11.159 --> 05:13.899

He's basically a fuckin' intern.

05:21.826 --> 05:23.566
Are you OK, Karl, on all this?

05:23.576 --> 05:25.149
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

- On the law?
- Yeah.

(CHUCKLES)

05:32.075 --> 05:34.941
Well, thank you.

05:34.951 --> 05:38.024
She has to stay in the city
for board meeting prep, so...

bump into anyone here.

06:02.075 --> 06:03.816
So how'd it go with Stewy?

06:03.826 --> 06:05.649
It went great. He's in.

06:05.659 --> 06:08.159
OK. Well, that's great.

06:09.534 --> 06:11.659
Yeah. So I think we're all good.

Uh-huh.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.983
Shall I just... run it one more time

06:18.993 --> 06:21.858
before we open our kimonos in public?

06:21.868 --> 06:24.065
GIVENS: Logan.

06:24.075 --> 06:25.482
Once the vote is proposed,

06:25.492 --> 06:27.399
he's recused... out of the game.

06:27.409 --> 06:31.524
So we have Kendall, Roman, Frank.
Three votes in favor.

06:31.534 --> 06:33.065

they're old guard, they'll go Logan.

06:45.784 --> 06:47.983

06:47.993 --> 06:50.357
he's still a possible, right?

little fuckin' screwdriver in.

It's not a fucking
teddy bear's picnic, Roman,

06:57.951 --> 06:59.691
- it's a massacre.
- Lawrence?

06:59.701 --> 07:01.858
Dad would sell Vaulter for parts.

07:01.868 --> 07:03.816
Lawrence would be crazy
not to vote with me.

07:03.826 --> 07:05.691
Except Lawrence hates you.

07:05.701 --> 07:08.816
We have three for Logan, five
against, three unknowns.

07:08.826 --> 07:12.107
Come on, this is bullshit.
Look, we push, Lawrence is ours,

07:12.117 --> 07:14.190
Ewan could be ours, Ilona could be ours.

Gerri can't vote, but she can
talk for senior management.

I don't want to know about?

08:08.325 --> 08:11.149
Yeah. And it's gone.

08:11.159 --> 08:12.524
Poof.

I don't fucking know!

08:40.576 --> 08:43.149
You know, a candidate can't change.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.441
You can primp and plump and repackage,

08:45.451 --> 08:47.733
but if you want to
change someone fundamentally,

08:47.743 --> 08:49.274
- forget it.
- So, should we go...

08:49.284 --> 08:52.065
very old New York classy?

08:52.075 --> 08:54.566
Oh. Yeah. Uh, I...

08:54.576 --> 08:58.733
Sorry, I had a pretty shitty phone
call with my mom the other day,

08:58.743 --> 09:01.024
and just to smooth things over
I said that we might

09:01.034 --> 09:04.149
have the wedding back in England.

09:04.159 --> 09:06.482
- You what?
- Yeah.

09:06.492 --> 09:09.143
- Is that a biggie for you?
- Excuse me, Shiv. Fuck.

09:09.154 --> 09:11.816
Tom, it's just a wedding. The
planners will figure it out.

09:11.826 --> 09:14.232
- "Just a wedding"? Shiv.
- Yeah.

09:14.242 --> 09:16.190
- It's our wedding!
- Oh, Tom...

09:16.200 --> 09:18.524
- It only happens once.
- I can't do this right now.

09:18.534 --> 09:20.024
- Tom.
- OK. No...

09:20.034 --> 09:21.357
I'm trying to think about work.

09:21.367 --> 09:24.232
And I'm looking forward to it,

09:24.242 --> 09:27.367
but I just can't get into
it all, all the details.

09:28.909 --> 09:31.566
I mean, the wedding might be
in England, but it might not.

09:31.576 --> 09:33.200
OK, OK, sorry, sorry.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.691
ROMAN:
So, I'll take Lawrence,

09:36.701 --> 09:38.733
and you firm up the others, yeah?

09:38.743 --> 09:41.232
That's OK. I got him.

09:41.242 --> 09:42.649
No, I know the guy.

09:42.659 --> 09:44.524
I see him at every fucking fakers party,

09:44.534 --> 09:46.482
phony soft opening that I go to.

09:46.492 --> 09:50.107

in a metrosexual think pod.

Look, are we doing this?

09:51.534 --> 09:53.774
Are we running a fucking
company together, or what?

09:53.784 --> 09:58.024
Just 'cause I like a joke doesn't
mean I'm a fucking clown.

09:58.034 --> 10:00.733
Look, Rome, I'm just trying to...

10:00.743 --> 10:02.441
- I got it.
- I know you're not a clown.

10:02.451 --> 10:03.774
- I'm not.
- It's delicate.

10:03.784 --> 10:05.441
Oh, it's delicate? I didn't realize

10:05.451 --> 10:07.232
it was delicate, the little nuances.

10:07.242 --> 10:09.691
Lawrence fuckin' hates you,
man, he does.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.357
- And he likes you?
- Yeah.

10:11.367 --> 10:12.733
He likes me. People like me.

10:12.743 --> 10:15.399
I look like a matador
and everyone wants to fuck me.

10:15.409 --> 10:17.607
I see him around. I know the guy.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.107
- Trust me.
- OK.

10:19.117 --> 10:22.566
KARL: Gerri says there
are multiple indicators

10:22.576 --> 10:24.899
he wants to be sympathetic
to our expansion.

10:24.909 --> 10:25.941
You think so?

10:25.951 --> 10:27.399
If he waves this through,

10:27.409 --> 10:29.816
he gets hundreds of local TV stations

10:29.826 --> 10:32.941
most amenable to talking about
what a great fuckin' guy he is.

10:32.951 --> 10:35.816
He just needs to be prepared to take
a little political heat is all.

10:35.826 --> 10:40.451
Four more years, we're Proctor
& Gamble of the news.

10:46.743 --> 10:50.607
Hey. Tom. Uh, I'm heading to Washington.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.585
Do you mind if I miss dinner? I
need to figure out about Joyce.

10:53.596 --> 10:55.337
No, sweetheart, that's fine.

10:55.348 --> 10:57.524
If you need to think about
your commitment to Joyce,

10:57.534 --> 10:59.607
then go, do it. Go to Washington.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.816
Yeah, I just wondered
if I picked the right horse.

11:01.826 --> 11:03.607
No, I get it, I do. Yeah.

11:03.617 --> 11:05.858
Slide her under the X-ray machine, baby.

11:05.868 --> 11:07.482
- OK. Love you. Bye.
- You, too. Bye.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.107
Hey hey, guy.

11:09.117 --> 11:10.691
Hey hey.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.399
Hey. Everything OK, Greg?

11:12.409 --> 11:14.159
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
- Sure?

11:15.659 --> 11:17.065
Good.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.983
Good good.

11:18.993 --> 11:20.691
You know, you can, uh,

11:20.701 --> 11:23.659
you can talk to me
about anything. You know?

11:25.409 --> 11:28.274
Oh, yeah. Well, I... Thanks.

11:28.284 --> 11:32.774
Fantastic... resource.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.784
(SCATTING UNDER BREATH)

11:35.909 --> 11:37.117
OK, OK.

11:38.284 --> 11:40.983
So, Shiv is going to Washington,

11:40.993 --> 11:46.034
so why don't, tonight,
why don't I take you out?

11:48.617 --> 11:50.451
No?

11:52.325 --> 11:55.065
What, for real?

11:55.075 --> 11:56.983
I thought you were gonna say

11:56.993 --> 12:00.566
"take you out
and beat the shit out of you,"

12:00.576 --> 12:03.858
or "take you out and put a bullet
through your dumb fuckin' brain,"

12:03.868 --> 12:05.691
or something else,
you know, funny like that.

12:05.701 --> 12:07.659
No, Greg, I'm not some beast.

12:09.451 --> 12:13.524
Well, actually, I finally got paid...

12:13.534 --> 12:15.627
(LAUGHS) Attaboy. OK.

12:15.638 --> 12:17.691
It's like they're not
paying the light bill here,

12:17.701 --> 12:20.107
but, um, but I actually got paid,

12:20.117 --> 12:23.399
and I was thinking about
maybe going to, um,

12:23.409 --> 12:26.399
have you ever visited
California Pizza Kitchen?

12:26.409 --> 12:29.441
(LAUGHS) No. Dear Lord, no.

12:29.451 --> 12:31.107
It's pretty delicious, Tom.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.149
No. No, it isn't, Greg.

12:33.159 --> 12:35.983
I mean, you might think it
tastes delicious, but...

12:35.993 --> 12:38.185
They make a Cajun chicken
linguini just how I like it.

12:38.196 --> 12:40.149
But that's not how
you're supposed to like it.

12:40.159 --> 12:44.232
OK, you probably have
quite an undereducated palate.

12:44.242 --> 12:47.858
So, let's go out, and I'll teach you.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.242
And I'll show you how to be rich.
OK? It'll be fun.

12:53.576 --> 12:56.315
He'll be just along
the hallway here, Mr. Roy.

12:56.325 --> 12:58.357
I have been here before,

12:58.367 --> 13:01.232
and I do know how hallways work.

13:01.242 --> 13:03.868
Someone will be with you shortly.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.482
What a fuckin' song and dance,
eh? (CHUCKLES)

13:12.492 --> 13:14.733
- Ah.
- Mr. Roy. I am so sorry,

13:14.743 --> 13:17.065
but the president passes on
his sincere apologies.

13:17.075 --> 13:19.691
He's currently dealing with
a matter of homeland security.

13:19.701 --> 13:22.065
He's sure you'll understand,
but he's going to need to offer

13:22.075 --> 13:24.441
an alternative face for this discussion.

13:24.451 --> 13:27.858
"Alternative face,"
what the fuck does that mean?

13:27.868 --> 13:30.899
If I drop my pants, I can
show you an alternative face.

13:30.909 --> 13:32.941
How does that sound?

13:32.951 --> 13:34.607
LOGAN:
Have I been snubbed?

13:34.617 --> 13:36.441
Find out if I've been snubbed.

13:36.451 --> 13:38.399
KARL: I don't think you've been snubbed.

13:38.409 --> 13:41.691
Is this a snubbing?!
Just fucking find out!

13:41.701 --> 13:44.315
Holy shit. Wamsgans!

13:44.325 --> 13:47.399
A fuckin' black eye?

13:47.409 --> 13:49.607
You should see the other guy. (LAUGHS)

13:49.617 --> 13:51.375
The guy who jammed his dick in your eye?

13:52.117 --> 13:53.774
Let's just say, uh,

13:53.784 --> 13:56.149
I was in bed, with Shiv, so...

13:56.159 --> 13:57.774
What? She punched you?

13:57.784 --> 13:59.441
No.

13:59.451 --> 14:02.065
Things just get a little hot and heavy.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.649
A little freaky-deaky. So...

14:03.659 --> 14:06.482
Fuckin' our sister? That's cool, man.

14:06.492 --> 14:09.024
Yeah, it's kinda weird
when you talk about that.

14:09.034 --> 14:10.983
ROMAN:
No, I think it's really cool.

14:10.993 --> 14:14.149
Like, what's it like,
like, to bang our sister?

14:14.159 --> 14:15.733
So what's goin' on? Clue me in.

14:15.743 --> 14:17.774
Uh, we just finished, bud.

14:17.784 --> 14:20.858
Yup. Yeah, I'm gonna go, uh,

14:20.868 --> 14:23.399
eat a fucking elk or something.

14:23.409 --> 14:24.649
See ya later.

14:24.659 --> 14:26.826
Oh, hey, Tom.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.315
Just to say I know

14:30.325 --> 14:31.983
you've been eating a lot of shit for me

14:31.993 --> 14:33.774
that I don't know about,

14:33.784 --> 14:35.816
and I appreciate that.

14:35.826 --> 14:39.107
And I want you to know:
I like you.

14:39.117 --> 14:40.899
You're Team Kendall, man.

14:40.909 --> 14:42.649
Lot of stuff goin' down,

14:42.659 --> 14:44.524
but you're on the team.

14:44.534 --> 14:46.868
Thanks, brother.

14:48.909 --> 14:50.733
Here's to us.

14:50.743 --> 14:51.993
To us.

14:53.534 --> 14:57.107
Uh, so I do need to ask something,

14:57.117 --> 14:58.691
but, um...

14:58.701 --> 15:00.607
we're cool, yeah?

15:00.617 --> 15:03.149
Like, we're fuckin' disruptors, Yeah?

15:03.159 --> 15:04.200
Yeah.

15:05.701 --> 15:08.691
But, um...

15:08.701 --> 15:11.190
what would you say...

15:11.200 --> 15:13.065
what would you say if I told you

15:13.075 --> 15:15.691
that there was gonna be a vote
of no confidence tomorrow?

15:15.701 --> 15:19.441
Kick out the old man,
in with the new guard.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.024
Romey and the homey.

15:21.034 --> 15:23.649
You and Kendall are thinking
of killing your dad?

15:23.659 --> 15:25.691
- Well...
- That's a little Greek tragedy.

15:25.701 --> 15:27.024
Yeah, Oedipus.

15:27.034 --> 15:29.065
Did I say that I was
going to fuck Marcia?

15:29.075 --> 15:32.733
No. Although I definitely
would, 'cause she's hot.

15:32.743 --> 15:35.743
But that's, you know,
that's like phase two.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.107
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:43.117 --> 15:44.868
- (CHUCKLES)
- (KISSES)

15:47.534 --> 15:49.566
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:49.576 --> 15:51.566
Yeah, no. No worries.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.190
This place has changed.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.441
Uh... yeah.

15:57.451 --> 16:01.190
I mean, well, e-everything changes.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.149
We've changed.

16:03.159 --> 16:07.024
What's this? Shiv Roy goes soulful.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.941
Does not suit you.

16:08.951 --> 16:12.941
It's like you're wearing a
turtleneck and a stick-on mustache.

16:12.951 --> 16:15.649
All right, yeah.

16:15.659 --> 16:17.743
Well, I do have feelings.

16:20.951 --> 16:24.107
So, uh, congratulations
on Senator Miller.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.566
Thank you.

16:25.576 --> 16:27.476
Not exactly the fuckin'
Southern Strategy,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.983
gettin' a bunch of Jews, blacks,
and media studies professors

16:29.993 --> 16:32.185
to vote in a Democrat in New
York state, but still...

16:32.196 --> 16:33.858
Fuck you. You've seen the numbers.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.566
Yeah, there's a number of ways
of analyzing the numbers.

16:36.576 --> 16:39.607
I did a fucking good job,
in the teeth of a scandal.

16:39.617 --> 16:43.357
At this point in the cycle, I
knocked it out of the fucking park.

16:43.367 --> 16:44.951
So here's to me.

16:47.284 --> 16:51.149
How's everything in the
People's Republic of Gil Eavis?

16:51.159 --> 16:52.159
Amazing.

16:53.868 --> 16:58.399
So, go on, Shiv, what is this?

16:58.409 --> 17:02.232
OK, uh, well...

17:02.242 --> 17:05.190
I want you to think about joining us.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.773
- Me and Joyce.
- Why?

17:07.784 --> 17:10.648
Because I need a piece
of shit on the team.

17:10.659 --> 17:13.148
What do you think?

17:13.159 --> 17:16.773
I THINK: Is it a good idea?
You and me?

17:16.784 --> 17:19.523
- Uh, yeah. Why?
- Historically speaking,

17:19.534 --> 17:23.492
we found it quite hard
not to fuck each other.

17:26.659 --> 17:30.274
It's great to see you...
on such short notice.

17:30.284 --> 17:31.399
Shush. Eat.

17:31.409 --> 17:35.190
I finished most of 'em, Grandpa.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.691
Your mother says
you don't have any money.

17:37.701 --> 17:40.691
Until recently, but actually, um,

17:40.701 --> 17:42.232
my pay came through.

17:42.242 --> 17:44.941
And now I'm incredibly rich.

17:44.951 --> 17:47.190
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.232
Well, uh, I'm sure you're
going to be very happy.

17:51.242 --> 17:52.691
Thank you.

17:52.701 --> 17:54.858
She also told me to feed you,

17:54.868 --> 17:57.024
so eat up.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.024
Whew. Honestly,

17:59.034 --> 18:00.733
I think my stomach might have shrunk

18:00.743 --> 18:05.024
during my... my period of poverty.

18:05.034 --> 18:08.691
The waste in this city is obscene.

18:08.701 --> 18:10.034
Finish it.

18:13.075 --> 18:15.941
So, how come you're here...
you're in town,

18:15.951 --> 18:17.482
uh, if I may ask?

18:17.492 --> 18:20.733
Well...

18:20.743 --> 18:23.617
you're a grownup, allegedly.

18:24.909 --> 18:28.315
So here's what grownups do.

18:28.325 --> 18:31.941
Kendall is gonna call for
a vote of no confidence

18:31.951 --> 18:35.524
against his own father
at the next board meeting.

18:35.534 --> 18:38.065
S-Sounds like a huge deal,

18:38.075 --> 18:40.941
but it's just procedure or...

18:40.951 --> 18:45.065
It's a wanton act
of egregious selfishness.

18:45.075 --> 18:47.733
In keeping with everything else
I've come to loathe

18:47.743 --> 18:51.065
about this rat's nest of a family.

18:51.075 --> 18:52.649
Right. Right.

18:52.659 --> 18:55.024
So are you gonna tell Logan?

18:55.034 --> 18:58.107
I'm gonna keep my snout of the trough,

18:58.117 --> 18:59.524
thank you very much.

18:59.534 --> 19:04.357
And my advice to you is:
paddle your own canoe.

19:04.367 --> 19:06.492
Hmm?

19:09.784 --> 19:11.451
(PHONE BUZZING)

19:17.659 --> 19:19.482
Hello?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.149
MARCIA:
Kendall?

19:21.159 --> 19:22.441
Marcia.

19:22.451 --> 19:24.941
I was wondering, if you're not busy,

19:24.951 --> 19:27.617
if you don't mind
joining your father for dinner?

19:29.659 --> 19:32.524
Did he ask to have dinner with me?

19:32.534 --> 19:33.607
Yeah.

19:33.617 --> 19:35.274
He's home alone,

19:35.284 --> 19:37.315
and I have something I cannot miss.

19:37.325 --> 19:41.649
Um... just him and me?

19:41.659 --> 19:44.774
Yeah. Is it a bad time?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.983
Do you have something planned?

19:46.993 --> 19:49.315
Uh, no. Of course.

19:49.325 --> 19:51.983
Um, no, I'm... I'm around.

19:51.993 --> 19:53.024
Thank you.

19:53.034 --> 19:54.983
I've left some steamed fish.

19:54.993 --> 19:56.617
Merci beaucoup.

19:57.868 --> 19:58.993
OK, su...

20:02.735 --> 20:04.172
Mmm.

20:04.183 --> 20:06.672
Exactly. When I had their monkfish,
I thought I was gonna shit,

20:06.683 --> 20:08.189
puke and cum all at once.

20:08.575 --> 20:12.356
That sounds... delicious.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.983
Although I don't actually
have much of an appetite.

20:14.993 --> 20:17.149
Well, you better find one quick,

20:17.159 --> 20:19.649
'cause this is one of the most
exclusive popups in the city,

20:19.659 --> 20:22.274
and we're having the full tasting menu.

20:22.284 --> 20:23.826
Uh-huh.

20:25.701 --> 20:29.607
How come the... the wine list
doesn't have any prices?

20:29.617 --> 20:31.482
Because they're obscene.

20:31.492 --> 20:35.524
Look, here's the thing
about being rich, OK?

20:35.534 --> 20:37.691
It's fucking great.

20:37.701 --> 20:41.065
OK? It's like being
a superhero, only better.

20:41.075 --> 20:43.816
You get to do what you want, the
authorities can't really touch you,

20:43.826 --> 20:46.691
you get to wear a costume,
but it's designed by Armani,

20:46.701 --> 20:49.691
and it doesn't make you
look like a prick.

20:49.701 --> 20:51.190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.534
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:55.534 --> 21:00.909
If I was going to come in
with you, what's your vision?

21:01.034 --> 21:02.232
Well, it's me and Kendall.

21:02.242 --> 21:04.607
Fuck Kendall. OK?

21:04.617 --> 21:06.909
You. What's your vision?

21:10.159 --> 21:11.482
You know what?

21:11.492 --> 21:14.733
I ended up in a book shop the other day,

21:14.743 --> 21:16.315
and I just started laughing.

21:16.325 --> 21:18.065
OK.

21:18.075 --> 21:21.024
I was looking at all the books
cramming up all the walls,

21:21.034 --> 21:23.816
and I just thought, you know,
about the olden days,

21:23.826 --> 21:26.232
all the fucking monasteries
and the Bibles

21:26.242 --> 21:29.607
and the sermons and the "Did Jesus
say this? And "Do you mean that?"

21:29.617 --> 21:31.024
and all the words and what have you.

21:31.034 --> 21:33.042
All gone. No one gives a fuck.

That's nice.

33:56.159 --> 34:00.232

we can't do other stuff.

34:00.242 --> 34:02.482
- Uh...
- Theoretically.

34:02.492 --> 34:05.107
I'm getting married in March.

34:05.117 --> 34:06.649
I'm getting married in May.

34:06.659 --> 34:09.399
- It's not a competition.
- Sure. Yeah.

34:09.409 --> 34:12.315
But only one of us is getting
married in lilac season,

34:12.324 --> 34:14.357
and it's not you.

34:14.367 --> 34:17.315
- NATE: Come on.
- SHIV: What?

34:17.324 --> 34:20.607
I have to say I am feeling...

34:20.617 --> 34:23.440
You're feeling what, Nate?

34:23.451 --> 34:26.149
I mean, we could masturbate
in separate rooms.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.690
- Oh, God!
- No. It's quite modern.

34:27.701 --> 34:29.524
- No. Come on!
- Or... Or...

34:29.534 --> 34:32.524
Just, for old times' sake, last one.

34:32.534 --> 34:33.858
Absolute last one.

I could just, you know,
the old traditional...

34:37.242 --> 34:39.858
simply... stick it in.

34:39.868 --> 34:43.357
Yeah. Like a gas station, right?

34:43.367 --> 34:45.440
Just stick it in.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.232
So a French doctor, huh?

34:47.242 --> 34:49.983
She sounds far too nice
and interesting for you.

34:49.993 --> 34:52.190
She's not that nice.

34:52.199 --> 34:56.868
Deep down she's... status- and
money-obsessed. Like you.

45:51.868 --> 45:53.357
OK? My father is a legend.

45:53.367 --> 45:55.733
I worship the ground he walks on.

45:55.743 --> 45:58.816
Nothing will ever detract from what
he's built and what he's done.

45:58.826 --> 46:01.107
But he is currently unfit
to run this company.

46:01.117 --> 46:04.274
- (KENDALL PANTING)
- Speak up. I can't hear.

46:04.284 --> 46:06.357
Not only because of his
refusal to take the time

46:06.367 --> 46:09.232
to recover from serious health issues,

46:09.242 --> 46:11.733
but because every day
he refuses to retire,

46:11.743 --> 46:15.024
he is one day closer
to destroying his own legacy.

46:15.034 --> 46:16.566
He took on levels of debt

46:16.576 --> 46:18.774
that threatened
the very existence of our firm,

46:18.784 --> 46:20.899
he is lining up dead-weight acquisitions

46:20.909 --> 46:23.399
in a sector that
he has a historic regard for

46:23.409 --> 46:25.149
but which is a non-growth area.

46:25.159 --> 46:27.566
We face existential battles in scale,

46:27.576 --> 46:30.607
and he is facing precisely
the wrong direction.

46:30.617 --> 46:34.733
He is making decisions for a future
that he no longer understands,

46:34.743 --> 46:37.065
and we don't have time for missteps.

46:37.075 --> 46:40.232
What used to take ten...
two, three years.

46:40.242 --> 46:41.774
Our entire ice cap will melt.

46:41.784 --> 46:43.899
He is gambling our last dollars
at the track

46:43.909 --> 46:45.858
on a horse that's ready
for the glue factory,

46:45.868 --> 46:48.149
and I am calling for
a vote of no confidence in him

46:48.159 --> 46:49.951
as CEO and chairman.

46:54.784 --> 46:56.274
Bullshit. No.

46:56.284 --> 46:58.983
I'm afraid since you are
the subject of the vote,

46:58.993 --> 47:01.524
you need to recuse yourself, Logan.

47:01.534 --> 47:04.858
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuckin' amateur
hour at the fuckin' circus.

47:04.868 --> 47:09.107
You don't get to vote, and you don't
get to comment, is the situation.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.899
You really should leave the room.

47:10.909 --> 47:12.566
OK, fine. Fine. Vote.

47:12.576 --> 47:14.107
Would you mind?

47:14.117 --> 47:15.691
Guys. Is he there?

47:15.701 --> 47:17.315
Is he still in the room?

47:17.325 --> 47:20.107
I'm sick. I can't move. Fuck that vote.

47:20.117 --> 47:23.357
He can't be in the room. OK? Guys...

47:23.367 --> 47:25.274
FRANK:
Let the minutes reflect

47:25.284 --> 47:28.482
that Logan Roy
was asked to recuse himself.

47:28.492 --> 47:30.649
LOGAN: Let the minutes
reflect that Logan Roy

47:30.659 --> 47:32.691
shoved his boot up Frank's ass.

47:32.701 --> 47:34.325
FRANK: OK.

47:38.576 --> 47:42.826
All in favor of the vote of
no confidence in Logan Roy?

47:57.484 --> 47:59.307
Me. My hand is raised.

47:59.325 --> 48:01.607
More in sorrow than in anger.

48:01.617 --> 48:03.492
Oh, no shit, Judas.

48:05.492 --> 48:06.941
Frank!

48:06.951 --> 48:09.190
Nice to see you back.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.816
Asha?

48:10.826 --> 48:12.399
I see you.

48:12.409 --> 48:14.190
And I see you, Logan.

48:14.200 --> 48:18.024
Oh, Jesus, this is just
un-frickin'-believable.

48:18.034 --> 48:20.441
Stewy? Stewy.

48:20.451 --> 48:22.190
Me. OK.

48:22.200 --> 48:25.649
Listen, as a major shareholder,

48:25.659 --> 48:29.858
and in the absence
of any real clarity here,

48:29.868 --> 48:32.232
I think it's the view

48:32.242 --> 48:37.399
that this is a family matter
and abstain.

48:37.409 --> 48:40.409
- Against.
- Strongly against.

48:42.484 --> 48:44.516
FRANK:
We have Ilona on the line.

48:44.534 --> 48:46.315
ILONA:
Hello, Logan. Yes.

48:46.325 --> 48:48.649
After consulting with my family,

48:48.659 --> 48:51.733
I am voting in favor of the motion.

48:51.743 --> 48:53.899
Thanks for nothin', Ilona.

48:53.909 --> 48:54.983
Fuck off.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.399
Go ahead.

49:03.409 --> 49:04.784
What are we on, 4-2?

49:07.451 --> 49:09.065
Go on.

49:09.075 --> 49:11.190
Yeah. Join the rats.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.576
Let's finish this, huh?

49:16.242 --> 49:17.909
I vote with Logan.

49:20.863 --> 49:23.473
DATU: I think we should take the
time to consider this properly

49:23.492 --> 49:25.190
when all parties are here.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.161
LOGAN:
Datu, we're voting now.

49:27.172 --> 49:29.524
FRANK: Logan, please, can you
stay out of the conversation?

49:29.534 --> 49:32.441
DATU: In which case, Logan.
I stick with Logan.

49:32.451 --> 49:35.899
LOGAN: Kendall, you
counted right there?

49:35.909 --> 49:37.858
You all right?

49:37.868 --> 49:42.399
Four against four,
this is your best shot?

49:42.409 --> 49:44.399
Lawrence?

49:44.409 --> 49:47.733
I don't have a dog
in this fight, Kendall.

49:47.743 --> 49:49.566
I abstain.

49:49.576 --> 49:52.107
FRANK:
So, currently

49:52.117 --> 49:56.357
we've got four votes in favor
of Logan to remain,

49:56.367 --> 49:58.774
four of stepping down, two abstentions.

49:58.784 --> 50:00.315
Uh, Gerri.

50:00.325 --> 50:01.583
Do you want to say anything

50:01.594 --> 50:05.232
to speak to the senior management
teams' attitudes here?

50:05.242 --> 50:08.274
- Shut the...
- GERRI: Well, you know,

I'm an independent observer,

50:10.451 --> 50:12.649
non-voting, a general counsel,

50:12.659 --> 50:14.659
so I'm not sure that's appropriate?

50:16.743 --> 50:19.566
Right. Thanks.

I think, uh...

51:22.701 --> 51:26.190
- It's tough, but maybe...
- Roman for me.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.190
FRANK: I'm not sure we
can count that for you.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.983
- Roman?
- Against.

51:29.993 --> 51:33.190
He s-started to vote,
I'm not sure he can change that.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.441
- He can fucking change.
- You shouldn't be here,

51:35.451 --> 51:37.482
you shouldn't be speaking here,
you should be out of this room.

- This is illegal.
- Whatever.

My son.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.024
That was your best shot.

51:55.034 --> 51:56.566
You lost.

51:56.576 --> 51:58.774

as to whether he lost...

52:01.743 --> 52:03.566
off the board,
fired with immediate effect.

Without exit package.

52:27.659 --> 52:29.774
Somebody send a telegram to Ilona

telling her she's no longer required,

52:32.034 --> 52:33.315
