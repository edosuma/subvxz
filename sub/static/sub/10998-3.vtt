11:16.810 --> 11:17.849

11:17.850 --> 11:19.899
Susan was a V.P. at Nationside.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.949
And she's got an interview next
week with Edgewick Capital.

11:21.950 --> 11:23.789

11:28.910 --> 11:30.920

Sometime soon?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.830

MedGenix made $2.5 billion last
year on their M.S. drug,

11:50.830 --> 11:52.889
but it loses its patent
protection next year,

11:52.890 --> 11:55.859
which is why they're testing Celinex.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.829
Celinex was developed by Dr.
Richard Watkins at CAL-SCI

11:57.830 --> 11:58.859
for his wife.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.829
She has the same type of M.S. Susan has.

12:00.830 --> 12:02.869
But Celinex wasn't
expected to go into clinical trials

12:02.870 --> 12:03.949
until next year.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.789
So the drug's not even finished yet.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.829
That's why it's poisoning people?

12:06.830 --> 12:07.859
But if that's true,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.749
the patients in the first clinical trial

12:09.750 --> 12:10.829
would've had the same symptoms.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.889
So where are they?

12:11.890 --> 12:13.979
Well, they're not in the published data.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.789
So we need to get our hands
on Dr. Watkins' raw data,

12:16.790 --> 12:19.769
- see if it matches, and if it doesn't...
- We've got him.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.749
I think I know where we can get it.

12:22.750 --> 12:23.819
From MedGenix?

12:23.820 --> 12:24.900
From Dr. Watkins.

12:25.830 --> 12:26.939
Watkins: 20 years ago,

12:26.940 --> 12:29.789
there were no approved
therapies for multiple sclerosis.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.939
But today, I'm able to
discuss a number of exciting...

12:31.940 --> 12:33.789
So, what's the plan?

12:33.790 --> 12:35.879
You distract him after
this with your... feminine wiles

12:35.880 --> 12:38.779

office and steal his laptop?

12:38.780 --> 12:40.890
Oh, sure. If this doesn't work.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.889
- You're hacking his laptop?
- He was asking for it.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.979
His password is his
wife's name and birthday.

12:49.780 --> 12:50.909

12:52.800 --> 12:53.949
to make her want to divorce him?

12:53.950 --> 12:55.890
I'm not really one to gossip.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.909
He cheated... one time...

12:57.910 --> 12:59.869
and then he felt so bad about it

12:59.870 --> 13:01.919
that he went and told Val, and
she still won't forgive him.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.949
- Wait. He's the victim in this story?
- I'm just saying...

13:03.950 --> 13:05.859
Shh!

13:05.860 --> 13:08.859
Along with the regulatory
role of dormant B-cells...

13:08.860 --> 13:10.749

13:10.750 --> 13:12.749

somebody at their worst,

13:12.750 --> 13:13.789
