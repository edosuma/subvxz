WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:03.937
PREVIOUSLY ON THE PRACTICE.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.506
I BELIEVE
YOU NEED EVIDENCE.

00:06.572 --> 00:08.974
WE WILL NOT
AUTOMATICALLY CONCLUDE

00:09.041 --> 00:10.810
THAT EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS ILLEGAL.

00:10.876 --> 00:12.412
THIS...

00:12.478 --> 00:15.815
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

00:15.881 --> 00:17.316
AND THIS IS THE LAND

00:17.382 --> 00:19.484
WHERE PEOPLE GO BACK
INTO THEIR JURY BOX

00:19.551 --> 00:20.786
AND SAY, "PROVE IT.

00:20.853 --> 00:22.854
"PROVE THE CRIME.

00:22.922 --> 00:23.989
YOU PROVE IT."

00:24.056 --> 00:26.225
THIS LAW FIRM
DOESN'T ADVERTISE.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.859
IT WOULD JUST BE
FOR MYSELF.

00:27.926 --> 00:29.227
YOU ARE A PART
OF THIS FIRM.

00:29.294 --> 00:30.662
LOTS OF LAWYERS
DO COMMERCIALS.

00:30.729 --> 00:31.863
YEAH, THE SHYSTERS.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.364
I WANT
TO CONTRIBUTE HERE.

00:33.431 --> 00:35.599
I WANT TO BRING IN
BUSINESS. AT LEAST
GIVE ME THE CHANCE.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.002
DOING A COMMERCIAL?
IT EMBARRASSES THIS PLACE.

00:38.069 --> 00:39.370
THERE'S LITTLE PEOPLE
OUT THERE,

00:39.437 --> 00:41.472
HACKS WITH SMALL CLAIMS
THE SIZE OF A BLACKHEAD

00:41.539 --> 00:43.974
YOU'D GO RUNNING
TO YOUR DERMATOLOGIST
TO HAVE REMOVED.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.644
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU
THAT YOU DON'T FIT
INTO THAT CATEGORY.

00:46.710 --> 00:47.578
I DO,

00:47.645 --> 00:50.347
AND I'M SELLING
WHAT I GOT TO SELL.

00:50.413 --> 00:51.982
THINK NOBODY'LL
FIGHT FOR YOU,

00:52.049 --> 00:53.450
YOU'RE JUST A GRUNT.

00:53.516 --> 00:54.551
I'M A GRUNT.

00:54.617 --> 00:56.653
THERE'S A LAWYER
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

00:56.719 --> 00:58.020
IT'S ME.

00:58.088 --> 00:59.656
JUST DIAL THE NUMBER...

01:02.992 --> 01:05.126
WHAT DO--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:09.565 --> 01:12.234
Gospel choir, softly:
♪ JESUS US ON
THE MAIN LINE ♪

01:12.301 --> 01:14.303
♪ TELL HIM
WHAT YOU WANT ♪

01:14.370 --> 01:17.273
♪ JESUS IS ON
THE MAIN LINE ♪

01:17.339 --> 01:19.908
♪ TELL HIM
WHAT YOU WANT ♪

01:19.975 --> 01:20.876
MR. ADELSTYNE?

01:20.942 --> 01:22.544
STEEN.

01:22.611 --> 01:23.845
STEEN.

01:23.912 --> 01:26.081
YEAH. YOU'RE NEXT.

01:26.147 --> 01:27.182
WHAT--

01:27.248 --> 01:29.217
WHAT IS GOING ON?

01:29.284 --> 01:31.186
JIMMY'S COMMERCIAL.
IT'S GETTING RESULTS.

01:31.252 --> 01:32.320
YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

01:32.387 --> 01:36.391
555-GRNT. THIS
IS WHAT YOU GET.

01:36.457 --> 01:37.357
STEEN.

01:37.425 --> 01:39.627
ADELSTEEN.
I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

01:39.694 --> 01:40.695
WHO'S NEXT?

01:40.761 --> 01:44.164
I SHOULD BE NEXT.
I HAVE CONNECTIONS.

01:45.699 --> 01:47.134
MA.

01:47.201 --> 01:48.468
I THOUGHT
I'D SURPRISE YOU.

01:48.535 --> 01:51.305
MA, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT IN THE HALL.

01:51.371 --> 01:53.573
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:53.640 --> 01:55.008
WELL...

01:55.074 --> 01:57.010
ACTUALLY, IT'S
A LITTLE PRIVATE.

01:57.076 --> 02:00.413
WE WERE HAVING DINNER
LAST NIGHT.

02:00.479 --> 02:02.615
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME
WHATEVER IT IS THEN?

02:02.681 --> 02:04.883
I ALMOST DID.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.019
BUT...THEN I THOUGHT

02:07.085 --> 02:09.455
IT MIGHT BE EASIER
TO TELL YOU HERE.

02:09.521 --> 02:11.657
IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

02:11.724 --> 02:12.658
NO, NO.

02:14.793 --> 02:18.730
UH, BUT, UH...

02:18.796 --> 02:20.098
JIMMY...

02:20.165 --> 02:21.966
WHAT?

02:22.033 --> 02:25.437
I'VE BEEN SEEING
SOMEBODY.

02:25.503 --> 02:27.705
OH?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.741
OH.

02:29.807 --> 02:31.475
UH,
THIS IS...GOOD.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.411
I KNOW YOU CAN'T
BEAR THE THOUGHT

02:34.478 --> 02:36.147
OF MY BEING
WITH ANYBODY
BUT YOUR FATHER.

02:36.213 --> 02:39.450
NO, I...

02:39.516 --> 02:42.318
HEY,
EVER SINCE HE DIED,
IT'S BEEN ME SAYING,

02:42.386 --> 02:44.320
YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT TO GO ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

02:44.387 --> 02:46.690
SWEETHEART...BE HONEST.

02:46.757 --> 02:49.860
I KNOW IT'S A JOLT.

02:49.926 --> 02:52.362
WELL.

02:52.428 --> 02:55.097
EVEN SO,
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

02:55.165 --> 02:58.300
IF YOU'RE HAPPY,
THEN...

02:58.368 --> 02:59.902
IS IT SERIOUS?

02:59.969 --> 03:02.705
YEAH.

03:02.772 --> 03:04.639
WE WANT TO GET MARRIED.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.541
MARRIED?

03:06.608 --> 03:09.278
WELL...UH...

03:09.344 --> 03:10.812
ARE YOU SURE?

03:10.879 --> 03:13.047
I MEAN, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN
THIS GUY?

03:13.114 --> 03:15.384
WELL,
HERE'S THE THING...

03:16.785 --> 03:18.419
HE'S NOT A GUY.

04:10.401 --> 04:11.736
HEY, YOU ALL SET?

04:11.803 --> 04:12.770
ALMOST.

04:12.837 --> 04:13.671
PORTER?

04:13.738 --> 04:15.440
VICTIM TAKES THE STAND.
BIG DAY.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.408
WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND RAPE?
WHERE DO WE STAND?

04:17.475 --> 04:19.277
PROBABLE-CAUSE HEARING
ON THAT IS ON WEDNESDAY.

04:19.344 --> 04:22.246
I'M HOPING TO WRAP UP
RAPE NUMBER ONE BEFORE
WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.

04:22.312 --> 04:23.213
INCIDENT REPORT?

04:23.280 --> 04:24.381
IN MY BAG.

04:24.448 --> 04:25.916
HIS FATHER
KEEPS CALLING ME.

04:25.983 --> 04:27.351
WHAT DO I TELL HIM?

04:27.417 --> 04:29.853
TELL HIM HE'S GOT
A WONDERFUL SON.

04:33.790 --> 04:36.360
ARE YOU...

04:36.426 --> 04:38.495
IS IT, LIKE,
ROMANTIC LOVE?

04:38.562 --> 04:40.897
YEAH.

04:40.964 --> 04:44.067
ARE YOU...

04:44.133 --> 04:45.634
YOU KNOW,
DUAL-SEXUAL,

04:45.701 --> 04:47.703
OR ARE YOU...

04:47.770 --> 04:48.737
THE OTHER?

04:48.804 --> 04:51.039
I'M GAY, JIMMY.

04:51.106 --> 04:52.908
YOU'RE NOT GAY!

04:52.975 --> 04:55.644
YOU CAN'T BE GAY.

04:55.711 --> 04:57.880
Y-YOU WERE MARRIED.
TO DAD.

04:57.946 --> 05:00.315
THAT'S WHAT WOMEN
OF MY GENERATION DID.

05:00.382 --> 05:01.884
WE MARRIED MEN.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.686
IT DIDN'T MATTER
WHETHER YOU WERE
HETEROSEXUAL OR NOT.

05:04.752 --> 05:07.255
DID DAD KNOW?

05:07.322 --> 05:09.991
I THINK
HE ALWAYS SUSPECTED.

05:10.057 --> 05:11.959
EVENTUALLY, I TOLD HIM.

05:12.026 --> 05:14.662
IS THAT
WHAT KILLED HIM?

05:14.729 --> 05:16.330
JIMMY, THERE'S A CORRIDOR
FULL OF THESE--

05:16.397 --> 05:17.999
GET OUT!

05:18.065 --> 05:19.166
PEOPLE.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.168
THERE'RE CLIENTS
OF THE FIRM.

05:21.235 --> 05:22.369
YOU DEAL
WITH THEM. OUT!

05:22.436 --> 05:23.837
LOOK, JIMMY,

05:23.904 --> 05:26.807
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
DENYING THIS,

05:26.873 --> 05:28.408
DENYING WHO I AM.

05:28.475 --> 05:31.277
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU ARE.

05:31.344 --> 05:33.313
YOU'RE YOU.

05:33.379 --> 05:34.414
THIS...

05:34.480 --> 05:37.517
THIS IS PROBABLY...
AN IDENTITY CRISIS.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.186
YOU KNOW, I READ
SOMEWHERE WHERE
PEOPLE CAN THINK

05:40.253 --> 05:41.421
THEY'RE SOMETHING
THAT THEY'RE NOT

05:41.487 --> 05:43.756
BECAUSE OF THINGS
THAT HAVE NOTHING
TO DO

05:43.823 --> 05:46.525
WITH WHAT THEY THINK
IT HAS TO DO WITH.

05:59.270 --> 06:01.172
I CAME IN TO SEE
THE GRUNT.

06:01.239 --> 06:02.574
NOW, YOU'RE
NOT THE GRUNT.

06:02.641 --> 06:04.676
THE GRUNT IS TIED UP
AT THE MOMENT.

06:04.743 --> 06:05.543
RIGHT.

06:05.609 --> 06:06.811
I'M WORKING TRIAGE.

06:06.878 --> 06:08.879
WHAT'S THE NATURE OF
YOUR CLAIM, PLEASE?

06:13.684 --> 06:15.519
I THINK
THAT MY DENTIST
TOUCHED ME

06:15.586 --> 06:17.120
WHILE I WAS UNDER.

06:17.187 --> 06:20.590
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

06:20.658 --> 06:24.061
I TAKE THE GAS
'CAUSE I'M SQUEAMISH,

06:24.127 --> 06:28.765
AND I KIND OF WOKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE LAST TIME.

06:28.831 --> 06:30.433
AND SHE WAS...

06:30.500 --> 06:34.704
F-FONDLING
MY G-GROIN AREA.

06:38.474 --> 06:42.478
MOTIVE MIGHT BE
TOUGH TO PROVE,
I REALIZE.

06:43.579 --> 06:45.814
Lichtman: AND DO YOU SEE
THE MAN WHO RAPED YOU

06:45.881 --> 06:47.349
SITTING IN THIS COURTROOM,
MS. FRASER?

06:47.416 --> 06:48.584
HE'S SITTING
RIGHT THERE.

06:48.650 --> 06:52.420
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT THAT IS THE MAN?

06:52.487 --> 06:54.222
YES, I AM.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.757
THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.328
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
HARD OR SOFT?

07:00.395 --> 07:01.796
YOU GOT NO CHOICE.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.598
IT'S OVER UNLESS
YOU SHAKE HER.

07:03.664 --> 07:05.165
YOU WANT THE HONORS?

07:05.232 --> 07:07.134
OH, NO.

07:07.201 --> 07:09.003
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

07:11.571 --> 07:15.009
RAPE IS A TERRIBLE CRIME,
ISN'T IT, MS. FRASER?

07:15.075 --> 07:16.943
YES, IT IS.

07:17.010 --> 07:18.945
AND IT WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE THING TO FALSELY
ACCUSE SOMEONE OF RAPE.

07:19.012 --> 07:22.048
THERE'S NOTHING
FALSE ABOUT
MY ACCUSATION.

07:22.115 --> 07:24.250
TERRIBLE, BECAUSE NOT ONLY
WOULD THAT DESTROY
THE LIFE OF THE PERSON

07:24.317 --> 07:26.552
FALSELY ACCUSED, BUT IT
WOULD MAKE PEOPLE LESS LIKELY

07:26.620 --> 07:28.321
TO BELIEVE THE CLAIMS OF WOMEN
WHO REALLY HAD BEEN RAPED.

07:28.387 --> 07:30.056
OBJECTION.

07:30.123 --> 07:31.224
SUSTAINED.

07:31.290 --> 07:33.092
YOU SAID YOU MET MR. PORTER

07:33.159 --> 07:34.427
AT A BAR CALLED McMULLEN'S.

07:34.493 --> 07:35.461
IT'S A RESTAURANT.

07:35.528 --> 07:37.062
THEY HAVE
A BAR IN IT.

07:37.129 --> 07:39.364
WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME
YOU HAD SEEN HIM THERE?

07:39.432 --> 07:41.634
WE HAD TALKED THERE
MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.803
WOULD IT BE FAIR
TO SAY THAT YOU HAD
FLIRTED WITH HIM?

07:44.870 --> 07:45.703
WE TALKED.

07:45.770 --> 07:47.539
WERE YOU SEXUALLY
ATTRACTED TO HIM?

07:47.605 --> 07:49.274
HE SEEMED
LIKE A NICE MAN.

07:49.341 --> 07:50.808
IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY

07:50.875 --> 07:53.245
THAT YOU WERE NOT
SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO HIM?

07:53.311 --> 07:54.479
THERE WAS SOME
ATTRACTION, YES--

07:54.546 --> 07:55.547
THANK YOU.

07:55.613 --> 07:56.648
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN--

07:56.714 --> 07:58.049
DID YOU WILLINGLY
LEAVE THE BAR WITH HIM?

07:58.115 --> 07:59.150
YES.

07:59.216 --> 08:01.252
YES.
HE GAVE YOU A RIDE HOME?

08:01.318 --> 08:03.587
AND WHEN YOU GOT HOME,
YOU INVITED HIM IN FOR
A NIGHTCAP, DIDN'T YOU?

08:03.654 --> 08:05.989
I DIDN'T INVITE HIM IN
TO RAPE ME, MR.YOUNG.

08:06.057 --> 08:08.459
THE TRUTH IS,
YOU INITIATED SEX
ONCE INSIDE THE APARTMENT--

08:08.525 --> 08:09.726
NO, I DID NOT.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.528
I REMIND YOU,
YOU'RE UNDER OATH.

08:11.595 --> 08:13.229
OBJECTION--

08:13.296 --> 08:14.130
YOU INITIATED--
I DID NOT!

08:14.197 --> 08:15.832
OBJECTION!
COUNSEL!

08:15.899 --> 08:17.533
WITHDRAWN. WHY DID YOU
GO TO THIS BAR ALONE?

08:17.600 --> 08:18.634
OBJECTION.

08:18.701 --> 08:20.003
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING,
MS. FRASER--

08:20.070 --> 08:21.037
OBJECTION.

08:21.104 --> 08:22.872
MY CLIENT HAS A RIGHT
TO CONFRONT HIS ACCUSER!

08:22.938 --> 08:23.939
SPEED IT UP.

08:24.006 --> 08:25.841
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING
THAT NIGHT, MS. FRASER?

08:25.908 --> 08:26.842
OBJECTION.

08:26.909 --> 08:27.943
SIT!

08:34.283 --> 08:37.785
IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD ON
THAT NIGHT, MS. FRASER?

08:37.852 --> 08:39.654
YES.

08:41.856 --> 08:43.792
A RAINY NIGHT IN FEBRUARY?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.127
TEMPERATURE, 31 DEGREES...

08:46.194 --> 08:49.664
YOU WALK INTO A BAR
ALONE...WEARING THIS.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.205
HAD YOU BEEN DRINKING
THAT NIGHT, MA'AM?

08:57.271 --> 08:59.640
I HAD A COUPLE
OF DRINKS.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.574
BEER, WINE, HARD ALCOHOL?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.676
VODKA TONIC.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.345
HARD ALCOHOL.
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW MANY YOU HAD?

09:05.412 --> 09:06.446
A FEW.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.849
MORE THAN 3,
MORE THAN 4?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.917
I HAD 3 AT THE BAR
AND A NIGHTCAP
WHEN I GOT HOME.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.885
4. WERE YOU
INTOXICATED, MA'AM?

09:12.952 --> 09:14.221
OBJECTION.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.355
OVERRULED.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.255
WERE YOU INTOXICATED?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.057
I'M SURE I WAS
AT LEAST SLIGHTLY
INTOXICATED,

09:18.124 --> 09:19.526
BUT AGAIN--

09:19.592 --> 09:20.627
WERE YOU DRUNK?

09:20.693 --> 09:22.061
NO, I WASN'T DRUNK.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.062
MS. FRASER,

09:23.129 --> 09:25.164
HAVE YOU EVER RECEIVED
PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELING

09:25.231 --> 09:27.233
PRIOR TO YOUR--

09:27.299 --> 09:29.000
OBJECTION!
MOVE TO STRIKE!

09:29.068 --> 09:30.001
COUNSEL, APPROACH.

09:34.673 --> 09:36.508
THE COMMONWEALTH
HAS RAPE SHIELD LAWS

09:36.575 --> 09:38.844
THAT EXPRESSLY PROHIBIT
THIS TYPE OF ATTACK
AND HE KNOWS IT!

09:38.910 --> 09:40.745
I'M NOT GOING
INTO PAST CONDUCT
OTHER THAN TO EXAMINE

09:40.812 --> 09:42.847
THE WITNESS' ABILITY
TO PERCEIVE AND OBSERVE.

09:42.914 --> 09:44.649
GOES TO CREDIBILITY,
POWERS OF PERCEPTION.

09:44.715 --> 09:48.453
THE LINE IS PROPER
UNDER 265, SUBSECTION 24.

09:48.519 --> 09:51.021
YOU'RE ON
A SHORT LEASH,
MR. YOUNG.

09:51.088 --> 09:52.657
STEP BACK.

09:58.695 --> 10:00.564
MS. FRASER,

10:00.630 --> 10:04.501
YOU RECEIVED
PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT
IN 1995 FOR DEPRESSION,

10:04.568 --> 10:06.570
DID YOU NOT?

10:12.108 --> 10:14.844
PUT UP A SIGN,
"NO MORE TODAY."

10:14.911 --> 10:16.779
Berluti: THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING, MA.

10:16.845 --> 10:19.282
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE!
I--I JUST CAN'T
DEAL WITH THIS!

10:19.348 --> 10:20.716
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THERE?

10:20.783 --> 10:23.452
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

10:23.519 --> 10:26.655
OH...SOMEBODY SPARE ME.

10:26.722 --> 10:29.191
Mary Beth: PLEASE,
SON, SIT DOWN.

10:31.626 --> 10:32.660
WHY ME?

10:32.727 --> 10:34.996
I MEAN,
THERE'S LOTS
OF OTHER LAWYERS

10:35.063 --> 10:37.299
WHO PROBABLY
SPECIALIZE IN...

10:37.365 --> 10:38.300
THIS.

10:38.366 --> 10:40.835
WELL, YOU'RE
THE ONLY LAWYER
I KNOW, JIMMY.

10:40.902 --> 10:43.204
PLUS I CAN'T REALLY PAY,
SO WHO AM I GOING TO GO TO?

10:43.270 --> 10:45.039
WHY IS IT
SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU...

10:45.106 --> 10:46.707
YOU KNOW, BE
OFFICIALLY MARRIED?

10:46.774 --> 10:50.911
I MEAN, YOU COULD
LIVE TOGETHER AND...

10:50.977 --> 10:52.246
GOD!

10:52.313 --> 10:55.549
THERE ARE
MONEY ADVANTAGES,
BENEFITS, TAXES.

10:55.616 --> 10:57.484
A LEGALLY MARRIED SPOUSE

10:57.551 --> 11:00.787
CAN MAKE EMERGENCY
MEDICAL DECISIONS.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.458
BUT MAINLY...

11:05.525 --> 11:06.959
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

11:07.027 --> 11:10.663
WE WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED
AS A COUPLE.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.799
I GOT TO BE HONEST,
MA.

11:13.866 --> 11:15.434
I THINK IT'S...

11:15.500 --> 11:16.501
SICK.

11:16.568 --> 11:18.503
DISGUSTING.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.973
I'M SORRY
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.208
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I RAISED YOU,

11:23.275 --> 11:26.578
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S HOW YOUR FATHER
RAISED YOU.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.179
YOU'RE COMING
INTO MY OFFICE...

11:28.246 --> 11:31.115
ASKING ME TO HELP
YOU MARRY A WOMAN.

11:31.182 --> 11:34.352
I WOULDN'T BE IN HERE
ASKING YOUR HELP, JIMMY...

11:36.855 --> 11:39.157
IF IT WEREN'T SO IMPORTANT.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.161
WE'LL REDUCE TO
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.
2 YEARS.

11:44.227 --> 11:46.096
I CAN'T TAKE ANY
JAIL TIME, CINDY.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.831
EUGENE, HE'S GONNA DO
JAIL TIME ANYWAY.

11:47.898 --> 11:50.000
HE'S UP ON ANOTHER RAPE
RIGHT AFTER THIS ONE, SO--

11:50.067 --> 11:52.702
FINE, BUT I CAN'T
RECOMMEND HE TAKE
TIME ON <i>THIS</i> CASE.

11:52.769 --> 11:54.071
IT'S HER WORD
AGAINST HIS.

11:54.137 --> 11:55.772
SHE INVITED HIM IN.
SHE'D BEEN DRINKING.

11:55.838 --> 11:57.140
NO PHYSICAL BRUISES.

11:57.207 --> 11:58.641
HE'S A CONVICTED RAPIST
WITH A RAP SHEET--

11:58.708 --> 12:00.209
BUT THE JURY
DOESN'T KNOW ALL THAT.

12:00.277 --> 12:01.911
FROM WHERE THEY SIT,
THERE'S REASONABLE
DOUBT.

12:01.978 --> 12:04.380
IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE
FOR ME TO RECOMMEND
JAIL TIME.

12:04.446 --> 12:05.414
OH.

12:05.481 --> 12:07.083
YOU'RE AFRAID HE'LL SUE.

12:07.149 --> 12:08.951
I'LL TAKE THE OFFER
IF IT'S ALL SUSPENDED.

12:09.018 --> 12:11.220
YOU CAN GET
YOUR JAIL TIME
ON THE NEXT CASE.

12:11.287 --> 12:13.622
IT'S A CONVICTION.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.157
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
TO GET IT.

12:15.224 --> 12:17.326
I GOT GOOSE BUMPS.

12:17.393 --> 12:18.894
FUN JOB YOU GOT.

12:20.896 --> 12:23.331
ALL SUSPENDED?
NO TIME SERVED?

12:23.398 --> 12:24.399
ON THIS CASE.

12:24.465 --> 12:26.134
BUT THE CONVICTION
WILL DEFINITELY
BE A FACTOR

12:26.201 --> 12:27.635
IN SENTENCING
ON THE NEXT CASE.

12:27.702 --> 12:29.204
IF I'M CONVICTED.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.938
RIGHT.

12:31.005 --> 12:32.440
OK.

12:32.507 --> 12:34.709
GOOD.

12:34.775 --> 12:36.611
ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO.

12:36.677 --> 12:38.178
LET'S GET 'EM, TEAM.

12:38.245 --> 12:41.816
THE JUDGE STILL
HAS TO SIGN OFF
ON THE PLEA BARGAIN

12:41.882 --> 12:42.917
BEFORE IT'S OFFICIAL.

12:42.983 --> 12:44.384
WE'RE GOING BACK IN
TOMORROW.

12:44.451 --> 12:46.520
OK.

12:46.586 --> 12:48.087
GOOD JOB.

12:48.155 --> 12:50.324
THANKS.

12:52.892 --> 12:54.894
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

12:54.961 --> 12:57.363
NOT THE END OF
YOUR WORLD, MAYBE.
IT'S NOT YOUR MOTHER.

12:57.430 --> 12:58.798
MY MOTHER'S DEAD.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.566
HEY, THIS IS WORSE.
TRUST ME.

13:00.633 --> 13:01.834
YOU THINK SO, JIMMY?

13:01.900 --> 13:05.771
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE INSENSITIVE
TO YOUR LOSS,

13:05.838 --> 13:09.908
BUT AT LEAST YOU GOT
ALL YOUR MEMORIES INTACT.

13:09.975 --> 13:12.544
MINE...IT'S LIKE
MY WHOLE FOUNDATION

13:12.610 --> 13:14.312
HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT
FROM UNDER ME.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.348
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR OWN MOTHER IS,

13:16.414 --> 13:18.416
HOW COULD YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
NOTHING'S REAL ANYMORE.

13:18.483 --> 13:20.652
COME ON, JIMMY.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.654
BOBBY, WE'RE CATHOLIC,
AND SO ARE YOU.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.955
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

13:24.021 --> 13:25.690
HAS RELAXED
A LITTLE BIT
ON HOMOSEXUALITY.

13:25.757 --> 13:28.259
OH, YEAH, RIGHT,
AND THEY LIGHTENED UP
ON EVOLUTION, TOO.

13:28.325 --> 13:30.828
I BET THEY SAY
IT'S THE GAYS WHO
COME FROM MONKEYS.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.496
YOU'RE BEING NUTS.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.265
IT'S UNNATURAL.

13:34.331 --> 13:36.100
IT'S <i>UNNATURAL!</i>

13:39.069 --> 13:42.706
LOOK, IF YOU
FEEL THAT WAY, THEN
DON'T TAKE HER CASE.

13:42.773 --> 13:45.776
I HAVE TO TAKE THE CASE.

13:45.842 --> 13:47.677
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.314
A MOTHER ASKS HER SON
TO DO SOMETHING,

13:51.381 --> 13:54.083
HE DOES IT.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.885
OF COURSE
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

13:57.953 --> 14:01.056
LINDSAY
REPRESENTED 2 MEN

14:01.123 --> 14:02.557
AGAINST
AN INSURANCE COMPANY

14:02.624 --> 14:03.993
LAST YEAR.

14:04.059 --> 14:07.329
A LOT OF THAT RESEARCH
WILL BE APPLICABLE.

14:07.396 --> 14:10.132
OK?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.868
SHE'LL HELP YOU.

14:19.841 --> 14:21.809
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THIS,

14:21.876 --> 14:23.677
BUT RIGHT NOW...

14:23.744 --> 14:26.347
I HOPE
THERE'S NO AFTERLIFE.

14:26.414 --> 14:28.982
I HATE TO THINK
OF MY FATHER UP THERE,

14:29.049 --> 14:31.251
LOOKING DOWN...

14:31.318 --> 14:32.820
SEEING THAT.

14:42.429 --> 14:45.197
DO YOU KNOW
YOUR SLEEVE LENGTH
OFFHAND?

14:45.265 --> 14:46.265
35.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.267
OK. WELL, OUR TAILOR
IS COMING.

14:48.334 --> 14:49.902
WE'LL TAKE A FEW
QUICK MEASUREMENTS.

14:49.969 --> 14:52.839
NOW, WE ALSO
HAVE THIS IN CHARCOAL.

14:52.905 --> 14:54.874
IT'S PRETTY STUNNING.

14:54.941 --> 14:56.108
NO. I LIKE
THIS COLOR.

14:56.175 --> 14:58.144
FINE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME

14:58.210 --> 15:00.579
TO PULL
A FEW COMBINATIONS?

15:00.646 --> 15:03.281
NO, THANKS.
I THINK I'LL BE FI--

15:03.349 --> 15:05.150
AH, THIS IS BRENDA,
OUR TAILOR.

15:05.216 --> 15:06.652
SHE'LL MARK
YOUR SLEEVES,

15:06.718 --> 15:07.953
AND YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR WAY.

15:08.019 --> 15:10.555
THAT'S THE MAN
WHO DID IT.

15:10.621 --> 15:11.589
WHAT?

15:11.656 --> 15:12.757
THAT'S THE MAN.

15:12.823 --> 15:13.758
M-MS. FRASER--

15:13.824 --> 15:16.060
THIS MAN RAPED ME!

15:16.127 --> 15:17.528
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

15:17.595 --> 15:18.929
THIS MAN RAPED ME!

15:18.996 --> 15:23.467
I GOT RAPED IN MY HOME,
THEN THIS MAN RAPED
ME AGAIN IN COURT.

15:23.533 --> 15:26.103
HE'S THE LAWYER WHO SAID
I HAD IT COMING.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.038
HE SAID I ASKED
TO BE RAPED

15:28.105 --> 15:29.939
BECAUSE OF THE CLOTHES
I WAS WEARING.

15:30.007 --> 15:32.776
HE SAID I INVITED
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

15:32.842 --> 15:34.210
BECAUSE I INVITED
THE MAN INTO MY HOME,

15:34.278 --> 15:36.145
I INVITED HIM TO RAPE ME.

15:36.212 --> 15:38.347
THAT'S THE MAN WHO DID IT!
THAT'S THE MAN!

15:38.414 --> 15:40.416
YOU WERE JUST DOING
YOUR JOB, WEREN'T YOU?

15:40.483 --> 15:42.218
JUST DOING YOUR JOB!

15:49.892 --> 15:52.795
I--I APPRECIATE THIS.

15:52.861 --> 15:55.864
TO ME, "CONSTITUTION"
MEANS HOW WELL A PERSON
CAN HOLD HIS FOOD.

15:55.931 --> 15:57.565
WELL, DON'T GET
YOUR HOPES UP.

15:57.632 --> 15:59.334
CONGRESS
MOVED FAST ON THIS.
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE--

15:59.401 --> 16:01.269
OH, MY HOPES AREN'T UP.
DON'T WORRY.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.505
MY HOPES ARE THAT
THE JUDGE WILL ORDER HER
TO GO STRAIGHT.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.640
JIMMY.

16:05.707 --> 16:07.375
MA. HI.
HI.

16:07.442 --> 16:09.544
THIS IS LINDSAY DOLE,
OUR CONSTITUTION SPECIALIST.

16:09.611 --> 16:10.545
A PLEASURE.

16:10.612 --> 16:12.780
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.149
JIMMY...

16:16.984 --> 16:19.820
THIS IS
MY F-FRIEND
MICHELLE SARDO.

16:19.886 --> 16:21.488
MY SON JIMMY.

16:21.555 --> 16:22.723
HELLO.

16:22.789 --> 16:26.126
HELLO. I'VE HEARD SO MANY
GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU.

16:29.095 --> 16:31.832
UH, LINDSAY DOLE,
MICHELLE SARDO.

16:31.898 --> 16:33.433
HELLO.

16:33.499 --> 16:34.634
HI.

16:38.003 --> 16:39.839
WELL, WE HAVE
AN EX PARTE HEARING

16:39.905 --> 16:41.240
SCHEDULED BEFORE
JUDGE NELSON.

16:41.307 --> 16:44.143
HE'S VERY FAIR...
AND LIBERAL.

16:49.348 --> 16:51.316
SO, HOW ABOUT
THOSE CELTICS?

16:51.383 --> 16:53.318
THAT'S BASKETBALL,
RIGHT?

16:55.019 --> 16:57.021
IS THIS A TEST?

16:57.088 --> 16:59.123
'CAUSE I KNOW
SHE LIKES HOCKEY.

17:02.694 --> 17:04.428
IT IS A TEST.

17:04.494 --> 17:08.499
NO. IT'S...

17:08.566 --> 17:10.034
YOU KNOW,

17:10.101 --> 17:12.035
THOSE BRUINS

17:12.102 --> 17:13.304
HAD SUCH
A TERRIBLE YEAR.

17:15.638 --> 17:16.940
YOU KNOW, UH,

17:17.007 --> 17:18.876
L-LINDSAY'S GOOD
WITH CIVIL RIGHTS,

17:18.942 --> 17:20.978
SO WE'RE IN GOOD HANDS
AND STUFF.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.948
WHY DON'T WE GO?

17:26.016 --> 17:27.049
UH, YEAH.

17:27.117 --> 17:28.618
LET'S GO.

17:34.924 --> 17:37.126
EUGENE, YOU CAN'T
LET IT BOTHER YOU.

17:37.193 --> 17:38.627
WHY, 'CAUSE I WAS
JUST DOING MY JOB?

17:38.694 --> 17:40.562
AS LONG AS YOU CAN
WRITE IT OFF TO JUST
DOING YOUR JOB,

17:40.629 --> 17:42.364
YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING, RIGHT?

17:42.431 --> 17:43.232
NO.

17:43.299 --> 17:45.133
BUT THIS IS
WHAT YOU DO.

17:45.201 --> 17:47.268
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
TOO DAMN LONG.

17:47.336 --> 17:49.438
NOW, I KNOW
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

17:49.505 --> 17:51.707
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST
PART IS? IT WASN'T HARD
FOR ME TO DO IT.

17:51.773 --> 17:54.275
I'VE DONE IT SO MANY
TIMES, I JUST PUT IT
ON AUTOMATIC PILOT.

17:54.342 --> 17:55.911
"RAPE IS A TERRIBLE
CRIME, ISN'T IT?

17:55.977 --> 17:57.112
AND IT WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE THING

17:57.178 --> 17:58.579
TO FALSELY ACCUSE
SOMEONE OF RAPE,
WOULDN'T IT?

17:58.646 --> 18:00.281
THAT WOULD NOT ONLY
DESTROY THE LIFE
OF THE PERSON

18:00.348 --> 18:01.349
BEING FALSELY ACCUSED,

18:01.416 --> 18:03.584
BUT ALSO Q-R-S-T-U-V-
W-X-Y AND Z.

18:03.651 --> 18:05.385
NOW, I KNOW MY ABCs.

18:05.453 --> 18:07.622
NEXT TIME, NEXT TIME,
WON'T YOU SING WITH ME?

18:07.688 --> 18:08.555
EUGENE--

18:08.623 --> 18:09.623
AGHH!

18:16.596 --> 18:18.097
YOU WANT ME TO ORDER

18:18.164 --> 18:20.233
THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS

18:20.300 --> 18:22.502
TO ISSUE A MARRIAGE LICENSE
TO YOUR CLIENTS?

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
IN OUR VIEW,
IT'S ILLEGAL NOT TO.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.139
YOU'RE AWARE
OF THE RECENT

18:26.205 --> 18:27.606
FEDERAL LEGISLATION
WHICH DEFINES--

18:27.673 --> 18:30.576
WE BELIEVE
THAT LEGISLATION
TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.011
YOU DO?

18:33.079 --> 18:36.114
YES, WE DO.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.484
AS ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.585
I SEE.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.421
WELL, YOU'VE DROPPED
A BOMB ON MY DESK.

18:43.488 --> 18:44.957
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO CHANCE

18:45.023 --> 18:47.125
OF ME RULING ON THIS
EX PARTE.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.361
I'M GOING TO NOTIFY THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

18:49.427 --> 18:52.063
SO I CAN HEAR
ORAL ARGUMENTS
FROM BOTH SIDES.

18:52.129 --> 18:54.031
IN WIDE-OPEN COURT?

18:54.098 --> 18:55.967
YES, COUNSEL,
WIDE-OPEN COURT.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.769
THAT'S THE WAY
I LIKE TO DO IT.

18:57.835 --> 19:00.104
OH, I JUST THOUGHT...

19:00.171 --> 19:02.106
I-IT MIGHT BE
MORE APPROPRIATE

19:02.173 --> 19:03.674
TO DO THIS
IN YOUR CLOSET.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.678
CHAMBERS.

19:10.381 --> 19:13.283

WHAT I DID TO YOU

21:01.185 --> 21:03.920
IT WAS ALSO
REQUIRED BY LAW.

21:03.987 --> 21:05.221
AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY,

21:05.288 --> 21:07.056
I HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING I CAN

21:07.123 --> 21:08.424
TO UNDERMINE

21:08.491 --> 21:10.493

21:13.462 --> 21:14.863
BUT FOR
THE PROCESS TO WORK,

21:14.931 --> 21:16.599
IT HAS TO BE
ADVERSARIAL.

21:16.665 --> 21:18.401
IS THAT WHY
YOU CAME HERE,

21:18.467 --> 21:20.936
TO LECTURE ME ON
THE ADVERSARIAL PROCESS?

21:21.003 --> 21:23.706
I CAME HERE TO SAY

21:23.772 --> 21:26.742
MY BEHAVIOR IN COURT

21:26.809 --> 21:29.044
WAS NOT MEANT
TO OFFEND YOU

MY EXPLANATION,

21:34.316 --> 21:36.451
I HOPE...

21:36.518 --> 21:39.587
THAT YOU MIGHT
AT LEAST...

21:39.654 --> 21:42.056
UNDERSTAND IT.

21:42.123 --> 21:46.227
THAT YOU KNEW
IT WAS INDECENT...

21:46.293 --> 21:48.962
ONLY MAKES YOU
MORE HATEFUL
FOR DOING IT.

21:49.030 --> 21:54.200
THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST
THAT YOU HAD NO CHOICE...

21:54.267 --> 21:55.902
IS OBSCENE.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.203
WH-WHAT I'M SAYING--

21:57.270 --> 21:58.572
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

21:58.639 --> 22:01.041
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
IN COURT, TOO.

22:01.107 --> 22:02.475
AND NOW YOU TELL ME,

22:02.542 --> 22:04.710
"DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY"?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.815
YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT
THE MAN WHO RAPED ME

22:09.882 --> 22:11.951
BACK ON THE STREETS,

22:12.017 --> 22:13.953
AND YOU COME
TO MY DOOR

22:14.019 --> 22:17.422
EXPECTING ME
TO UNDERSTAND.

22:27.599 --> 22:29.634
NOTHING IN THE STATUTES
OF OUR CONSTITUTION

22:29.701 --> 22:32.436
AND NOTHING IN
THE STATUTES OF THE LAWS
OF THIS COMMONWEALTH

22:32.503 --> 22:34.906
SAYS MARRIAGE HAS TO BE
A MAN AND A WOMAN--

22:34.973 --> 22:38.109
AND, CERTAINLY, NOTHING
IN THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY.

22:38.176 --> 22:40.010
THERE'S A REASON
CONGRESS JUST PASSED

22:40.078 --> 22:41.579
THE DEFENSE
OF MARRIAGE ACT.

22:41.645 --> 22:43.914
YEAH, IT WAS
AN ELECTION YEAR.

22:43.981 --> 22:47.551
AND ALSO BECAUSE,
TO EXPAND MARRIAGE
INTO SAME-SEX PARTNERSHIPS

22:47.618 --> 22:49.419
WOULD SERVE TO OBLITERATE
THAT INSTITUTION.

22:49.486 --> 22:51.188
OBJECTION.
ARGUMENTATIVE.

22:51.254 --> 22:53.756
THAT'S THE POINT OF
THIS SESSION, COUNSEL--
TO HEAR ARGUMENTS.

22:53.823 --> 22:56.926
LOOK, MARRIAGE
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
AN EVOLVING CONCEPT.

22:56.993 --> 22:58.761
IT USED TO BE BLACKS
COULDN'T MARRY WHITES.
IT USED TO BE--

22:58.828 --> 23:00.830
THAT'S A DIFFERENT BAG,
COUNSEL.

23:00.897 --> 23:02.732
ALWAYS FUNDAMENTAL TO
THE NOTION OF MARRIAGE

23:02.799 --> 23:05.534
IS PROCREATION,
AND SAME-SEX--

23:05.601 --> 23:07.536
PROCREATION? SO COUPLES
THAT DON'T PLAN
TO HAVE CHILDREN

23:07.603 --> 23:08.570
SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED--

23:08.637 --> 23:10.206
McGovern:
ANOTHER DIFFERENT BAG.

23:10.272 --> 23:12.141
WHY ARE ALL
OUR ARGUMENTS BAGS?

23:12.208 --> 23:13.542
MS. DOLE IS RIGHT.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.277
BLACKS CAN NOW
MARRY WHITES,

23:15.344 --> 23:16.745
JEWS CAN NOW
MARRY CHRISTIANS,

23:16.812 --> 23:19.681
AND LESBIANS
SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO MARRY OTHER MOTHERS.

23:19.748 --> 23:21.883
LESBIANS.

23:21.950 --> 23:23.318
McGovern: LOOK, IT'S--

23:23.384 --> 23:27.055
IT'S A LOVELY NOTION
TO EMBRACE SUCH TOLERANCE,

23:27.122 --> 23:28.623
AND THE EXPANSION
OF GAY RIGHTS

23:28.689 --> 23:30.425
IS IMPORTANT TO THE GROWTH
OF THIS NATION.

23:30.491 --> 23:34.462
MAJOR CORPORATIONS
NOW RECOGNIZE HOMOSEXUALS
AS DOMESTIC PARTNERS,

23:34.529 --> 23:36.330
AS DO MANY
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

23:36.396 --> 23:38.298
AS THEY SHOULD.

23:38.365 --> 23:40.067
BUT THIS IS MARRIAGE.

23:40.134 --> 23:43.470
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE.

23:43.537 --> 23:46.540
MORE THAN HALF
OF WHICH SANCTITIES
END UP IN DIVORCE.

23:46.606 --> 23:48.408
CUT TO IT, COUNSEL.

23:48.475 --> 23:50.243
OK, WHAT'S NEXT?

23:50.309 --> 23:52.045
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?
SURE, WE CAN DO THAT.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.247
HOW ABOUT WHEN 3 PEOPLE
WANT TO JOIN IN UNION?

23:54.313 --> 23:58.384
ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS
OF--OF LOVE AND--AND
FAMILY APPLY.

23:58.451 --> 23:59.986
WHY SHOULDN'T
WE LET THEM?

24:00.053 --> 24:03.422
HOW ABOUT 2 BROTHERS
WHO SAY IT'S CENTRAL
TO THEIR SEXUALITY?

24:03.489 --> 24:05.157
NOW, THAT'S
REALLY SICK.

24:05.223 --> 24:07.025
UH, CONTINUE.

24:07.092 --> 24:09.061
WHERE DOES IT STOP?

24:09.127 --> 24:13.065
SHOULD SEX EDUCATION
IN SCHOOL INCLUDE
HOMOSEXUAL SEX?

24:13.131 --> 24:14.299
AND WHAT ABOUT FIDELITY?

24:14.366 --> 24:15.700
WHAT ABOUT IT?

24:15.767 --> 24:18.103
SAME-SEX UNIONS--
AND DON'T ANYBODY
SHOOT ME HERE--

24:18.170 --> 24:21.172
BUT SAME-SEX UNIONS
AREN'T FOUNDED
ON FIDELITY

24:21.239 --> 24:23.140
THE WAY HETEROSEXUAL
COUPLES ARE.

24:23.207 --> 24:24.141
OH, REALLY?

24:24.208 --> 24:25.743
ARE YOU GAY?

24:25.810 --> 24:27.178
ME? NO...

24:27.244 --> 24:30.081
BUT I--I'D STILL LIKE
TO KNOW THE AUTHORITY
FOR WHICH HE SAYS THAT.

24:30.147 --> 24:31.548
I REFERENCE
ANDREW SULLIVAN,

24:31.615 --> 24:33.917
ONE OF
THE LEADING ADVOCATES
OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGES,

24:33.985 --> 24:36.120
WHO SAYS THAT
"A HOMOSEXUAL UNION

24:36.187 --> 24:39.055
REQUIRES A GREATER
UNDERSTANDING
OF THE NEED--"

24:39.122 --> 24:42.859
I REPEAT--"THE NEED FOR
EXTRAMARITAL OUTLETS."

24:42.926 --> 24:45.561
MONOGAMY
IS NOT AS CENTRAL
TO SAME-SEX UNIONS.

24:45.628 --> 24:48.231
MONOGAMY IS FUNDAMENTAL

24:48.298 --> 24:51.067
TO THE INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE.

24:51.134 --> 24:53.836
AS I SAID
AT THE BEGINNING,
CONGRESS THOUGHT HARD

24:53.903 --> 24:56.238
BEFORE PASSING
THE DEFENSE
OF MARRIAGE ACT,

24:56.305 --> 24:58.007
AND THEY THOUGHT
SOUNDLY.

24:58.073 --> 25:00.810
PRESIDENT CLINTON,
EVEN, IS AGAINST
SAME-SEX MARRIAGES,

25:00.876 --> 25:03.145
REGARDLESS WHETHER
THEY ASK OR TELL.

25:03.212 --> 25:08.850
WHAT THEY'RE ASKING HERE
IS TO PRY OFF
A VERY DANGEROUS LID.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.753
I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT
THAT YOU SAY NO.

25:20.494 --> 25:21.529
MR. BERLUTI?

25:23.631 --> 25:24.932
MOVE TO STRIKE.

25:24.998 --> 25:28.068
YOUR HONOR, COULD WE
TAKE A MINUTE?

25:28.135 --> 25:29.136
MOVE TO STRIKE?

25:29.202 --> 25:30.704
I PANICKED.
MOVE TO STRIKE?

25:30.771 --> 25:31.739
THERE'S AN EMPTY ROOM
UP AHEAD.

25:31.805 --> 25:32.840
IT DIDN'T GO WELL,
DID IT?

25:32.906 --> 25:35.375
NO. JIMMY,
I CAN ARGUE THIS THING,

25:35.442 --> 25:37.244
BUT IT'S SUCH
A LONG SHOT.

25:37.310 --> 25:39.012
I THINK YOU SHOULD FINISH.
ME?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.714
COMING FROM THE SON,
IT'LL BE MORE EFFECTIVE.

25:41.781 --> 25:45.284
UH, YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
THE CONSTITUTION EXPERT.

25:45.352 --> 25:46.719
YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT.

25:46.786 --> 25:48.420
PLUS WHICH, IT DOESN'T
MAKE HER SICK.

25:48.487 --> 25:50.156
HEY, I'M HERE,
AIN'T I?

25:51.724 --> 25:53.825
WELL, YOU TELL ME, JIMMY,
ARE YOU REALLY HERE?

25:53.893 --> 25:55.561
HEY, MA...

25:55.627 --> 25:58.897
YOU'RE--YOU'RE GOOD
AT GUILTING ME, BUT THIS
ISN'T EXACTLY THE TIME,

25:58.964 --> 26:00.532
AFTER WHAT
YOU JUST DID TO ME.

26:00.599 --> 26:02.701
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

26:03.802 --> 26:05.170
THIS WE CAN DISCUSS LATER.
FOR NOW--

26:05.236 --> 26:06.738
WE CAN DISCUSS THIS NOW.

26:06.805 --> 26:08.106
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

26:08.173 --> 26:09.540
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

26:09.607 --> 26:11.076
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

26:11.142 --> 26:13.478
I'LL TELL YOU.
YOU MARCH INTO MY OFFICE

26:13.544 --> 26:16.614
AND ANNOUNCE
EVERYTHING WAS PRETEND,

26:16.681 --> 26:17.815
THAT YOU'RE
SOMETHING ELSE.

26:17.882 --> 26:20.851
THAT'S RIGHT, JIMMY,
I PRETENDED,

26:20.918 --> 26:24.121
AND I PRETENDED
MOSTLY FOR YOU.

26:26.991 --> 26:30.660
DON'T YOU THINK THAT I
SACRIFICED ENOUGH?

26:34.364 --> 26:36.032
TO PRETEND...

26:38.534 --> 26:40.203
MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE...

26:43.072 --> 26:46.075
I WAS SOMETHING
I WASN'T FOR THE SAKE
OF MY CHILDREN.

26:46.142 --> 26:49.412
OH, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
THE SACRIFICE I MADE?

26:49.478 --> 26:51.814
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.617
THAT'S YOUR JOB
AS A PARENT.

26:56.418 --> 26:59.021
WHEN DOES THE JOB END?

26:59.087 --> 27:01.389
YOU'RE 35 YEARS OLD.

27:01.456 --> 27:03.158
I'M 62.

27:04.592 --> 27:07.629
WHEN DOES THE TIME
COME FOR ME?

27:14.936 --> 27:17.738
FORGIVE ME
FOR MAKING YOU SO SICK.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.607
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

27:20.674 --> 27:23.644
YOU DIDN'T JUST
COME OUT OF SOME CLOSET.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.646
YOU--YOU CHARGED OUT.

27:25.712 --> 27:28.949
BEFORE I EVEN HAD TIME
TO ABSORB ANYTHING,

27:29.015 --> 27:31.217
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GO TO COURT

27:31.284 --> 27:33.419
TO MAKE A BIG CASE
OUT OF IT.

27:33.486 --> 27:36.722
YOU DID THIS
TO HURT ME ON PURPOSE.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.061
AND I WON'T LET YOU
GUILT ME!

27:44.597 --> 27:46.431
THE REASON SHE CAME
TO YOUR OFFICE

27:46.498 --> 27:50.169
IS BECAUSE SHE KNEW
HOW YOU'D REACT,

27:50.235 --> 27:54.606
AND SHE THOUGHT
IF SHE COULD GET YOU
TO CONVINCE SOME JUDGE

27:54.673 --> 27:57.609
TO ACCEPT HER
FOR WHAT SHE IS,

27:57.676 --> 28:00.044
MAYBE <i>YOU</i> COULD SOMEHOW
COME TO ACCEPT IT.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.781
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU'RE
A VERY NICE PERSON, BUT--

28:02.847 --> 28:04.682
BUT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:05.649 --> 28:09.287
I HAVE 3 CHILDREN
OF MY OWN, JIMMY.

28:09.353 --> 28:10.421
I UNDERSTAND.

28:10.488 --> 28:11.655
OH...

28:11.722 --> 28:13.056
AND I BET THEY'RE
REAL SUPPORTIVE,

28:13.123 --> 28:14.124
LIKE LIBERAL ADULTS.

28:14.191 --> 28:16.660
THEY THREW YOU A BIG
COMING-OUT PARTY.

28:16.727 --> 28:18.929
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THEY DIDN'T.

28:18.996 --> 28:22.499
TO THEM, I DON'T
REALLY EXIST ANYMORE,

28:22.565 --> 28:24.667
SO I <i>DO</i> UNDERSTAND.

28:30.006 --> 28:31.040
JIMMY...

28:31.107 --> 28:33.876
JUST TALK THE LEGALS, OK?
NO SPEECHES.

28:33.943 --> 28:34.877
OK.

28:36.378 --> 28:37.613
LEGALLY...

28:38.580 --> 28:39.681
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

28:42.751 --> 28:44.019
2 YEARS, SUSPENDED?

28:44.085 --> 28:47.022
IF THE JUDGE AGREES,
WHICH WE'LL KNOW
IN AN HOUR.

28:47.088 --> 28:50.692
BOBBY, ON THE NEXT ONE,
I WANT OFF.

28:50.759 --> 28:51.793
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT OFF?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.895
I MEAN I WANT OFF.

28:53.962 --> 28:55.430
ONE RAPE A WEEK
IS MY LIMIT.

28:55.496 --> 28:57.132
THE PROBABLE CAUSE
HEARING IS TODAY.

28:57.198 --> 28:58.799
ELLENOR CAN DO IT.

29:00.067 --> 29:01.402
CAN YOU?

29:01.469 --> 29:03.037
UH, SURE.

29:03.103 --> 29:05.773
YOU'RE NOT UP TO SPEED
ON THE SECOND CASE,
ELLENOR.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.141
YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOURSELF.

29:07.207 --> 29:08.709
I CAN GET UP TO SPEED.

29:10.377 --> 29:11.845
EUGENE,
YOU'RE DOING IT.

29:11.912 --> 29:13.981
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
DOING IT.

29:15.215 --> 29:18.585
YOU DON'T SPRING
DISCOMFORT 3 HOURS
BEFORE A HEARING.

29:18.652 --> 29:19.819
YOU HANDLE IT.

29:19.886 --> 29:21.988
I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE
EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION.

29:22.055 --> 29:25.024
NO, YOUR DISCOMFORT
COMES FROM
KNOWING YOU <i>CAN.</i>

29:25.091 --> 29:27.160
THIS KID'S FATHER
PAYS US A LOT OF MONEY.

29:27.226 --> 29:28.694
OH, WELL, THEN.

29:28.761 --> 29:30.463
HEY, I DON'T FORCE YOU
TO TAKE CASES, EUGENE,

29:30.529 --> 29:32.064
BUT HAVING
TAKEN THE CASE,

29:32.131 --> 29:33.799
YOU CAN'T PULL OUT
LAST MINUTE.

29:33.866 --> 29:36.268
GET THE PLEA ENTERED
ON THE FIRST CASE,

29:36.334 --> 29:38.671
DO THE PROBABLE CAUSE
ON THE SECOND ONE,

29:38.737 --> 29:40.839
THEN, WE'LL TALK ABOUT
MOVING YOU OFF.

29:45.543 --> 29:46.811
YOU GIVING ME
AN ORDER?

29:46.878 --> 29:49.547
YOU <i>WANT</i> ME
TO GIVE YOU AN ORDER?

29:49.614 --> 29:54.051
JUST BECAUSE
I HATE PULLING RANK
DOESN'T MEAN I WON'T.

30:33.055 --> 30:35.157
IT'S NOT JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW--

30:35.224 --> 30:36.425
UH, I'LL--I'LL GO
AND WAIT OVER THERE.

30:36.491 --> 30:37.692
NO...

30:37.759 --> 30:39.328

30:42.664 --> 30:43.798

MUCH ABOUT ME?

30:44.733 --> 30:46.200
ARE YOU KIDDING?

30:46.267 --> 30:49.070
BLINDFOLD ME, AND
I CAN PLAY PIN THE TAIL
ON YOUR BIRTHMARKS.

30:50.271 --> 30:51.805
ALL SHE DOES
IS TALK ABOUT YOU.

30:51.872 --> 30:54.875
YEAH, THAT'S
KIND OF THE THING.

30:54.942 --> 30:58.912
IF THERE'S
A MOTHER AND SON
CLOSER THAN US ANYWHERE,

30:58.979 --> 31:00.013
I'D LIKE TO MEET THEM.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.915
WE'VE BEEN EATING
DINNER TOGETHER

31:01.982 --> 31:03.951
3 TIMES A WEEK
EVER SINCE I LEFT HOME,

31:04.017 --> 31:06.219
AND, ALL THE WHILE,

31:06.286 --> 31:08.121
YOU AND MICHELLE--

31:09.789 --> 31:13.260
AS MUCH AS IT HURTS,
YOUR TELLING ME THAT--

31:13.326 --> 31:15.495
YOUR <i>NOT</i> TELLING ME
HURTS MORE.

31:15.562 --> 31:17.229
I KNOW.

31:19.431 --> 31:22.902
IT WAS KILLING ME, JIMMY.
I--I COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

31:22.969 --> 31:25.237
THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
I HAD TO TELL YOU.

31:28.174 --> 31:31.242
I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE.
I ALWAYS WILL...

31:35.180 --> 31:36.848
BUT I NEED
MICHELLE...

31:37.716 --> 31:39.250
TOO.

31:43.854 --> 31:45.290
YOU'RE AGREEING TO THIS?

31:45.356 --> 31:47.592
NOT HAPPILY,
BUT I WANT A CONVICTION.

31:47.658 --> 31:50.561
CONVINCE ME I'LL GET IT,
AND I'LL BE A JERK
AND REVOKE THE OFFER.

31:53.263 --> 31:54.298
MR. PORTER...

31:55.665 --> 31:58.068
REMAINING AS NEUTRAL
AS I CAN BE,

31:58.135 --> 32:01.671
THE IDEA OF LETTING YOU
WALK WITH NO JAIL TIME

32:01.738 --> 32:05.409
IS ALMOST AS OFFENSIVE
AS YOUR CRIME.

32:05.475 --> 32:06.976
PLEA ENTERED--

32:07.043 --> 32:08.812
2 YEARS, SUSPENDED.

32:12.215 --> 32:14.417
I WISH YOU
THE VERY BEST OF LUCK

32:14.483 --> 32:17.153
IN YOUR NEXT RAPE TRIAL.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.287
ADJOURNED.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.498
YOUR PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING
IS IN THE B.M.C.

32:30.565 --> 32:31.899
ON THE OTHER CASE?

32:31.966 --> 32:33.668
WE SHOULD GO
IN AN HOUR OR SO.

32:33.735 --> 32:34.902
OK.

32:45.412 --> 32:46.613
EXCUSE ME.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.182
EUGENE...

32:48.249 --> 32:49.316
I WOULDN'T.

33:00.961 --> 33:02.595
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

33:03.796 --> 33:07.500
WHETHER YOU CHOOSE
TO BELIEVE ME OR NOT
IS TOTALLY UP TO YOU,

33:07.567 --> 33:10.069
BUT I AM SORRY FOR
WHAT I HAD TO DO TO YOU.

33:12.638 --> 33:14.607
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO ME.

33:16.575 --> 33:19.811
YOU ATTACKED
A TOTAL STRANGER SITTING
IN THAT WITNESS CHAIR.

33:19.878 --> 33:24.082
YOU'RE HERE FEELING SORRY
FOR THE PERSON YOU MET
IN A CLOTHING STORE.

33:24.148 --> 33:27.285
YOU WANT FORGIVENESS,
MR. YOUNG?

33:27.351 --> 33:30.789
GO FIND SOME OTHER
ANONYMOUS RAPE VICTIM
YOU CHEWED UP.

33:30.855 --> 33:32.623
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

33:42.333 --> 33:45.636
THAT PROCREATION
ARGUMENT IS
ENTIRELY SPURIOUS.

33:45.703 --> 33:48.438
I MEAN, NO OLD PEOPLE
WOULD BE ALLOWED
TO GET MARRIED

33:48.505 --> 33:49.372
IF THAT'S THE TEST.

33:49.439 --> 33:51.441
I DIDN'T LEND ANY MERIT
TO THAT ARGUMENT.

33:51.508 --> 33:52.442
MAY I CLARIFY?

33:52.509 --> 33:55.011
NO, I THINK YOU CAME OFF
GOOD AND CLARIFIED,

33:55.078 --> 33:57.247
MR. McGOVERN,
AND IT'S <i>MY</i> TURN NOW.

33:58.781 --> 34:00.383
I'M NO EXPERT
ON GAY PEOPLE.

34:00.450 --> 34:04.520
TRUTH IS, I--I'VE NEVER
EVEN KNOWN ONE UP CLOSE

34:04.586 --> 34:05.988
UNTIL NOW.

34:06.055 --> 34:07.356
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I DO KNOW.

34:07.423 --> 34:09.757
I KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT CONGRESS TO SAY

34:09.824 --> 34:11.427
THEY'RE THE LAST
GROUP OF SCHLUBS
WHO SHOULD BE TELLING US

34:11.493 --> 34:13.594
WHAT THE INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE IS.

34:13.661 --> 34:15.531
THAT DEFENSE
OF MARRIAGE ACT,

34:15.597 --> 34:18.333
I BELIEVE THAT WAS
STARTED BY A SENATOR
AND A CONGRESSMAN

34:18.399 --> 34:20.467
WHO HAD 5 WIVES
BETWEEN THEM,

34:20.534 --> 34:23.004
AND ONE OF THEM
WENT ON TO BECOME
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.

34:23.071 --> 34:25.273
AND IT WAS SIGNED
BY A PRESIDENT

34:25.340 --> 34:27.342
WHO I PERSONALLY
DON'T RELY ON

34:27.408 --> 34:30.110
FOR FAMILY-VALUE
FIDELITY TIPS.

34:30.178 --> 34:32.447
THE ISSUE, COUNSEL,
NOT THE POLITICS.

34:32.513 --> 34:34.214
THIS ISSUE
IS <i>ALL</i> POLITICS.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.449
GAY PEOPLE CAN'T MARRY.

34:36.516 --> 34:37.952
THAT ISN'T POLITICS?

34:38.018 --> 34:39.753
YOU DON'T THINK
HE'S RUNNING FOR SOMETHING?

34:39.820 --> 34:42.056
AGAIN, THE ISSUE, PLEASE.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.091
WE LET SEX OFFENDERS
MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN,

34:44.158 --> 34:45.625
WE LET PEOPLE IN PRISON
GET MARRIED,

34:45.692 --> 34:48.828
WE LET CONVICTED
DEADBEAT DADS MARRY AGAIN,

34:48.895 --> 34:52.398
SO LET'S NOT PREACH
ABOUT THE SANCTITY
OF SOME INSTITUTION.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.266
IT'S EVERYBODY'S RIGHT
TO GET MARRIED.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.302
WHY DON'T <i>THEY</i> GET IT?

34:56.369 --> 34:58.371
AND LET ME SAY THIS.
THAT CRACK ABOUT GAY PEOPLE

34:58.437 --> 35:01.340
BEING PROMISCUOUS AND
NOT UNDERSTANDING FIDELITY,

35:01.407 --> 35:04.310
WHAT'S THAT,
IF NOT BLATANT BIGOTRY?

35:04.377 --> 35:06.645
IF HE SAID THAT ABOUT BLACKS
OR SOME OTHER RACE,

35:06.712 --> 35:08.213
YOU WOULD'VE
POUNCED ON HIM,

35:08.280 --> 35:10.983
BUT YOU LET IT GO
ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS.

35:11.049 --> 35:12.084
SHAME ON YOU.

35:14.152 --> 35:15.753
AND FOR THIS GAY...

35:17.022 --> 35:18.590
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

35:18.656 --> 35:20.625
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOYAL.

35:20.692 --> 35:23.995
SHE STAYED FAITHFUL
TO MY FATHER FOR 30 YEARS,

35:24.061 --> 35:25.196
EVEN THOUGH--

35:26.798 --> 35:29.333
EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T
NECESSARILY COME NATURAL.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.536
SHE PRETENDED
FOR THE SAKE OF--

35:37.274 --> 35:40.343
SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT
COMMITMENT TO FAMILY MEANS.

35:41.712 --> 35:42.746
THIS PERSON...

35:54.590 --> 35:56.559
I'M HER SON...

35:58.761 --> 36:00.629
AND I, UH...

36:02.197 --> 36:04.766
I HATE THE FACT THAT
MY MOTHER'S A LESBIAN.

36:04.833 --> 36:07.136
I ADMIT THAT.

36:07.202 --> 36:09.638
BUT I'VE ALSO NEVER BEEN
MORE PROUD OF HER.

36:15.076 --> 36:19.647
AND WHETHER THIS COURT
SAYS IT'S OK FOR YOU
TO GET MARRIED OR NOT,

36:19.713 --> 36:20.648
I PROMISE...

36:22.116 --> 36:24.518
YOU AREN'T GOING TO GET
ANY ARGUMENT FROM ME.

36:42.134 --> 36:43.936
SHE'S RIGHT.

36:44.003 --> 36:46.673
YOU'RE NOT BEATING
YOURSELF UP BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU DID IN A COURTROOM.

36:46.739 --> 36:49.408
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
YOU BUMPED INTO HER
IN A CLOTHING STORE.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.243
AND SUPPOSE YOU RAN INTO HER
IN THAT CLOTHING STORE

36:51.310 --> 36:54.713
BEFORESHE TOOK THE STAND?
THEN WHAT, EUGENE?

36:54.780 --> 36:55.881
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.616
MY POINT IS,

36:57.683 --> 37:00.185
WE CAN'T LET THEM BE
HUMAN BEINGS ON THE STAND.

37:00.251 --> 37:01.487
THEY'RE THE ENEMY.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.221
YOU KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN I DO.

37:03.288 --> 37:06.457
IT HAS TO BE
US AGAINST THEM.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.293
THEY'RE NOT MOTHERS,
THEY DON'T HAVE JOBS

37:08.359 --> 37:11.062
OR--OR PET DOGS
OR HOBBIES.

37:11.129 --> 37:14.832
THEY ARE ACCUSING
WITNESSES, PERIOD.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.834
NOW GROW UP.

37:19.837 --> 37:22.272
LOOK, IF YOU
DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO
THE PROBABLE CAUSE,

37:22.339 --> 37:24.174
THEN I WILL DO IT.
NEVER MIND WHAT BOBBY SAYS.

37:24.241 --> 37:25.575
MAYBE I <i>SHOULD</i> TAKE OVER.

37:25.642 --> 37:27.477
I KNOW THE CASE.

37:27.544 --> 37:28.445
I CAN DO IT.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.147
EUGENE, WE HAVE
A HALF AN HOUR.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.548
YOU CAN BRING ME
UP TO SPEED.

37:31.615 --> 37:32.849
I'M FINE.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.618
I CAN DO IT.

37:36.820 --> 37:40.723
I MUST SAY,
I FOUND THE CANDOR
OF THIS HEARING TO BE...

37:40.790 --> 37:41.958
VERY REFRESHING.

37:42.025 --> 37:43.626
NEITHER SIDE
TRIED TO HIDE ITS BIAS,

37:43.692 --> 37:45.861
SO I'M NOT GOING
TO TRY TO HIDE MINE.

37:47.363 --> 37:50.399
THOUGH I'M CERTAINLY WILLING
TO TOLERATE HOMOSEXUALITY,

37:50.466 --> 37:53.035
I'M JUST NOT
READY TO ENCOURAGE IT.

37:53.101 --> 37:55.170
AND BY PERMITTING
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,

37:55.237 --> 37:58.673
WE DO, IMPLIEDLY,
HOLD IT UP AS AN IDEAL,

37:58.740 --> 38:02.144
BECAUSE MARRIAGE <i>IS</i>
A GREAT, GREAT THING.

38:02.210 --> 38:05.647
NOW, THERE IS
INCREASING RESEARCH,

38:05.713 --> 38:09.216
INCLUDING THAT OF FORMER
HARVARD PROFESSOR
E.G. PATTULLO,

38:09.283 --> 38:12.754

TO LIVE HETEROSEXUAL...

38:14.421 --> 38:16.357
<i>OR</i> HOMOSEXUAL LIVES.

38:16.423 --> 38:19.993
I CITE A 1993 ARTICLE
IN THE <i>WASHINGTON POST,</i>

38:20.060 --> 38:21.562
WHICH NOT ONLY SUPPORTS
THIS RESEARCH,

38:21.628 --> 38:23.964
BUT GOES ON
TO QUOTE TEENAGERS

38:24.030 --> 38:26.633
WHO NOW FIND IT COOL

38:26.700 --> 38:30.636
TO SAY THAT
THEY ARE GAY OR BI.

38:32.105 --> 38:35.841
THERE ARE KIDS TODAY
GOING THROUGH A LOT
OF SEXUAL CONFUSION.

38:35.908 --> 38:39.479
AS A JUDGE, I DON'T WANT
TO SAY OR SUGGEST

38:39.545 --> 38:43.548
THAT ONE WAY IS JUST
AS NATURAL AS THE OTHER.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.285
IF THIS MAKES ME
A BIGOT...

38:47.619 --> 38:51.523

42:34.332 --> 42:36.134
A PERSON CAN COMMIT,
WOULD YOU AGREE?

42:36.201 --> 42:37.735
I SUPPOSE SO.

42:37.803 --> 42:39.037
AND IT WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE THING

42:39.104 --> 42:41.339
TO FALSELY ACCUSE SOMEONE
OF RAPE, WOULDN'T IT?

42:41.406 --> 42:42.973
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.909
TERRIBLE, BECAUSE
NOT ONLY WOULD THAT
DESTROY THE LIFE

42:44.975 --> 42:46.944
OF THE PERSON
BEING FALSELY ACCUSED,

42:47.011 --> 42:48.779
BUT IT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE
LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE

42:48.846 --> 42:51.081
THE CLAIMS OF WOMEN
WHO <i>HAD</i> BEEN RAPED.

42:51.148 --> 42:52.750
Lawyer: OBJECTION.
WITHDRAWN.

42:55.785 --> 42:59.156
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING
ON THIS NIGHT,
MS. BURKE?

43:01.157 --> 43:04.160
PLEASE TELL THE COURT
WHAT YOU WERE WEARING.

43:07.330 --> 43:08.932
NEXT ONTHE PRACTICE.

43:08.998 --> 43:09.966
TAKE THE HELMET.

43:10.033 --> 43:11.000
I DON'T NEED THE HELMET.

43:11.067 --> 43:12.768
HE'D SHOOT YOU IN THE CHEST
BUT NOT THE HEAD?

43:12.835 --> 43:13.802
HE'S NOT GOING
TO SHOOT ME.

43:13.869 --> 43:15.771
THEY CHASED ME IN HERE!
THEY DID THIS!

43:15.838 --> 43:17.072
I'D LIKE TO LET
THIS WOMAN GO.

43:17.139 --> 43:18.507
NO, YOU DON'T!

43:18.574 --> 43:20.909
YOU'RE LYLA
FROM <i>THE MAROONED.</i>

43:20.976 --> 43:25.480
I KNOW I WAS
SOME SORT OF SEXUAL ICON
TO TEENAGE BOYS BACK THEN.

43:25.547 --> 43:27.282
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

43:27.462 --> 43:29.028
SENATOR PATANKI'S
ASSAULT TRIAL--

43:29.962 --> 43:31.962
I'D LIKE YOU
TO SECOND-CHAIR.

43:32.028 --> 43:33.562
THAT TRIAL
STARTED YESTERDAY.

43:33.628 --> 43:36.662
BEFORE I ASK THE WITNESS
MY NEXT QUESTION,

43:36.728 --> 43:40.062
I'M GOING TO ASK THE JURY
TO OBSERVE HIM.

43:40.128 --> 43:42.028
BOBBY, WHO IS HE?

43:43.528 --> 43:44.562
WHAT?

43:44.628 --> 43:47.262
THE WITNESS.
WHO THE HELL IS HE?

44:10.328 --> 44:11.795
YOU STINKER!
