WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:04.666
-Trusting this man is not a good idea.
-I can handle him.

00:04.750 --> 00:08.916
The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys,
and no two are alike.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.083
LOKI: You're all Variants!

00:10.166 --> 00:13.541
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.375
MOBIUS: The nexus event you caused,

00:20.458 --> 00:23.000
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.583
RENSLAYER: Fine. You want the truth?

00:24.666 --> 00:26.083
I'm trying to protect you.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.583
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

00:28.666 --> 00:30.583
You know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?

00:30.666 --> 00:32.625
Wherever it is I'm really from.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.958
Yeah, wherever I had a life
before the TVA came along.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.125
-Prune him.
-

00:37.458 --> 00:39.791
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.541
You're Variants.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.625
We're the same.

00:45.041 --> 00:46.625
SYLVIE: Mindless androids.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.916
LOKI: Then who created the TVA?

00:49.458 --> 00:51.958
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

00:55.833 --> 00:59.250
You're gonna tell me everything.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.250
LOKI: What is this place?
Where are we? Who are you?

03:22.333 --> 03:25.416
This is The Void. That's Alioth.
And we're his lunch. Come on!

03:54.458 --> 03:55.958
Give me your TemPad.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.750
-Who's really behind the TVA?
-I'm as in the dark as you are.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.625
Poor Judge Renslayer.
Your whole reality's been destroyed.

04:06.375 --> 04:09.833
Tell me, how does it feel
to be on the other side of it?

04:13.666 --> 04:14.875
This is it, isn't it?

04:17.375 --> 04:20.291
This is where you dragged me
after you stole my life.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.541
-A fitting place, then, to take yours.
-And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?

04:26.625 --> 04:27.625
Not yet, anyway.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.500
-I'd say you were lying.
-Maybe.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.333
-Or maybe we want the same thing.
-How is he still alive?

04:33.750 --> 04:37.500
And how will saving him get us closer
to who's really behind the TVA?

04:38.333 --> 04:39.375
It's complicated.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.375
-I'm telling you this willingly.
-Why?

04:42.458 --> 04:44.375
Because I wanna know
who's at the top of this.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.625
I want to know who lied to me.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.125
When we prune a branched reality,

04:51.208 --> 04:53.583
it's impossible
to destroy all of its matter.

04:53.666 --> 04:57.375
So we move it to a place on the timeline
where it won't continue growing.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.666
Basically, the branched
timeline isn't reset.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.750
-It's transferred.
-To where?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.458
A void at the end of time.

05:05.208 --> 05:08.750
Where every instance of existence
collides at the same point

05:08.833 --> 05:11.125
and simply stops.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.750
Why?

05:14.541 --> 05:15.958
I don't know.

05:16.041 --> 05:20.083
The dogma states that the end of time
is still being written,

05:20.833 --> 05:23.833
that the Time-Keepers
are transforming it into utopia.

05:23.916 --> 05:26.541
That's nice. Super believable.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.083
Whatever the real reason...

05:29.791 --> 05:31.833
nothing ever comes back from there.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.333
I can help you if you trust me.

05:58.666 --> 06:01.750
I suggest we take a breather,
so I can ask several thousand questions.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.750
-Gotta keep moving so we don't die.
-Okay, but what's your plan?

06:04.833 --> 06:06.541
-Don't die.
-Okay, but beyond that?

06:06.625 --> 06:08.250
-Don't die.
-That's not a plan.

06:08.333 --> 06:12.250
It's a general demand of living.
If you're Lokis, you should always have...

06:15.791 --> 06:18.791
Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going on?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.875
Look, it's been a very, very,
very trying past few days.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.750
Months? I don't even know
how long it's been since New York.

06:26.833 --> 06:29.000
All I know is, I got pruned
and I woke up here,

06:29.083 --> 06:33.500
and now I'm surrounded
by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,

06:33.583 --> 06:36.291
which sadly I didn't find
all that strange.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.041
And now we're running from God knows what
to God knows where.

06:39.125 --> 06:42.375
When I need to be trying to find
a way back to the TVA.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.708
Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.958
You mean the monster in the sky?

06:54.708 --> 06:55.708
Thank you.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.875
This is the place
where the TVA dumps its rubbish,

06:58.958 --> 07:00.333
everything they prune.

07:01.041 --> 07:03.333
And Alioth,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.166
he ensures none of it ever returns.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.666
BOASTFUL LOKI: It's a living tempest
that consumes matter and energy.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.875
They send entire branched realities here
that are devoured instant--

07:13.958 --> 07:16.833
We're in a shark tank.
Alioth is the shark.

07:18.416 --> 07:20.583
Oh, there's no such thing
as an alligator tank.

07:20.666 --> 07:23.916
Besides, it's a better metaphor.
He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.125
Hang on,

07:25.208 --> 07:27.541
-that thing's a Loki too?
-Oh, yes.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.750
Okay, fine. Willing to accept that.
Why are there so many of you?

07:33.833 --> 07:35.875
Because Lokis survive.
That's just what we do.

07:35.958 --> 07:37.750
-Great. So how do we escape?
-We don't.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.583
All of us were arrested by the TVA
and pruned, just like you.

07:41.666 --> 07:45.250
And just like you, we all stood around
making bad plans that went nowhere.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.666
But we could use a TemPad.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.166
Oh, the one thing
that could get us out of here, yes.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.375
They're all over the place, right, guys?

07:53.458 --> 07:55.333
Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

07:55.416 --> 07:57.541
The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.375
-Surely there's something to do.
-There is.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.958
Survive. That's all there is.
All there ever was.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.916
KID LOKI: We're done talking. Let's go.

08:04.791 --> 08:06.083
Just do what you want.

08:13.416 --> 08:14.625
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.875
Why do you wear the horns?
You let a child command you.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.958
You'll do well to respect the boy.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.416
-This is his kingdom.
-LOKI: Right.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.916
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.708
I killed Thor.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.791
So, why did you want to return
to the TVA so badly, anyway?

09:19.208 --> 09:21.333
You leave your glorious purpose there?

09:25.458 --> 09:26.666
Something like that.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.958
RENSLAYER: Miss Minutes,
I need you to remote access

09:38.041 --> 09:40.416
a series of restricted files
from the archives.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.500
MISS MINUTES: Ooh, doggy! On what?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.166
RENSLAYER: The beginning of time.
The founding of the TVA.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.708
-MISS MINUTES: Right away.
-Wait.

09:49.416 --> 09:52.666
-What about the end of time?
-It's just a void.

09:53.541 --> 09:56.791
What if The Void isn't the end?
What if there's something beyond it?

10:03.708 --> 10:07.708
Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses
obscured me from the TVA

10:07.791 --> 10:10.708
because I couldn't create
a diverging branch there, right?

10:12.208 --> 10:16.333
So if all of this is still being written,
whatever happens is just a new timeline.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.750
It would be impossible
to start a nexus event there.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.833
-You could be completely undetectable.
-That's it.

10:21.916 --> 10:25.458
-That's the only place they could be.
-So how do we get past The Void?

10:26.875 --> 10:28.416
It's impossible.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.583
There's nothing for the TemPad
to lock onto, no destination.

10:31.666 --> 10:32.875
Then we go through it.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.750
-That's suicide.
-Then I guess my need for you has passed.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.750
Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.583
Yes, the prototype.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.708
Great. I'll get the file.

10:47.583 --> 10:50.458
It's a spaceship designed
to withstand the temporal void.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.583
It could take us to the end of time.

10:52.666 --> 10:54.750
-Find Loki.
-Find the man behind the curtain.

10:54.833 --> 10:56.416
-And kill him.
-Together.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.833
Miss Minutes,
where are the files on this timecraft?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.375
MISS MINUTES: Still lookin', hon.

11:09.416 --> 11:10.958
Nothing?

11:11.041 --> 11:12.458
Hmm. Buried pretty deep.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.875
It's highly restricted.
I might not even have clearance.

11:15.958 --> 11:18.083
Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

11:19.416 --> 11:20.541
How long?

11:20.625 --> 11:21.958
Any second now.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.500
GUARD: Go! Go! Go! Move it!

11:27.166 --> 11:29.666
-You hurt?
-I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.875
Sylvie? Not thinking
of going on the run, are you?

11:33.666 --> 11:35.000
We know where you hide.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.000
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.000
It must be so exhausting.

11:43.541 --> 11:46.208
I'll admit you had me fooled there
for a minute.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.458
Or did you get a little real?

11:49.875 --> 11:54.833
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed
by her beloved TVA?

11:54.916 --> 11:58.916
Why don't you come back out
and we can talk about it?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.791
Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off
and we can settle this between us.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.208
Works for me.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.916
What happened to finding
the man behind the curtain?

12:08.541 --> 12:11.291
Tell you what.
You come out with your hands up

12:11.375 --> 12:13.500
and I'll put you in a time loop.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.750
Something not so bad.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.750
You can live out your days
in a good memory.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.875
Do you have any good memories?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.333
Just one, really.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.541
-She self-pruned.
-Good.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.166
Then she's dead, too.

12:57.708 --> 13:02.625
So, after I vanquished
Captain America and Iron Man,

13:03.208 --> 13:07.041
I claimed my prize,
all six Infinity Stones.

13:10.333 --> 13:13.958
That's alligator for growling
and saying "liar" at the same time.

13:14.041 --> 13:17.458
At least my nexus event
wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.541
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.583
-Tell them your story, Loki.
-Me?

13:34.166 --> 13:35.791
Nobody wants to hear about that.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.125
I would, actually.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Um...

13:40.416 --> 13:43.041
It's just I've been wondering,
because I'm...

13:44.666 --> 13:47.708
Well, we're supposed to die, right?

13:47.791 --> 13:49.666
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.333
Thanos?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.125
In my timeline,

13:56.750 --> 13:59.166
everything proceeded correctly,
my entire life,

13:59.250 --> 14:01.458
until Thanos attacked our ship.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.208
So, you didn't try to stab him?

14:03.291 --> 14:04.416
Certainly not.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.625
Take no offense, my friends,

14:06.708 --> 14:10.833
but blades are worthless
in the face of a Loki sorcery.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.875
They stunt our magical potential.

14:13.958 --> 14:17.458
-But they look awesome.
-CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yes.

14:17.541 --> 14:21.083
Especially when they clatter to the ground
just before your neck is snapped.

14:21.875 --> 14:27.750
I cast a projection of myself so real,
even the Mad Titan believed it.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.541
Then hid as inanimate debris.

14:32.208 --> 14:35.208
After I faked my death,
I simply drifted in space.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.208
Away from Thor, away from everything.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.500
Thought about the universe
and my place in it,

14:41.583 --> 14:44.291
and it occurred to me
that everywhere I went,

14:44.375 --> 14:45.875
only pain followed.

14:46.416 --> 14:49.500
So I removed myself from the equation,

14:49.583 --> 14:53.750
landed on a remote planet
and stayed there in isolation, in solitude

14:54.500 --> 14:57.750
for a long, long time.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.041
How did the TVA find you?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.041
I got lonely.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.791
To tell you the truth,
I missed my brother,

15:12.875 --> 15:15.625
and I wondered if he missed me,
if anybody else did.

15:15.708 --> 15:18.833
But as soon as I took
my first steps to getting off the planet,

15:18.916 --> 15:20.375
the TVA arrived.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.083
Because we, my friends,
have but one part to play,

15:24.583 --> 15:28.208
the God of Outcasts.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.041
Nothing more.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.750
The God of Outcasts.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.041
-I'm going.
-Going where?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.916
Out of this place,
out of The Void, back to the TVA.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.208
We're as good at escaping
as we are at surviving.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.000
That gives me a decent chance.

15:51.083 --> 15:54.041
-You won't do either, you'll be murdered.
-Well, so be it.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.833
-That was my destiny to begin with.
-You're different.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.833
-Why?
-No, I'm not, you see?

16:00.916 --> 16:03.666
I'm the same, really.
I'm the same as all of you.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.583
Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.833
-Sounds terrifying.
-Oh, she is.

16:09.916 --> 16:12.041
But that's kind of what's great about her.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.416
She's different.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.875
She's not trying to take over the TVA,
she's trying to take it down.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.166
And she needs me.

16:18.916 --> 16:22.250
Now, you said Alioth
is what keeps us here.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.208
You said it's a living thing.
You said it's a shark.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.416
Well, if it lives, it dies.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.625
So I'm gonna kill the shark.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.500
I'm gonna kill Alioth,
and I could use all the help I can get.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.333
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.333
-Monsters.
-CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yeah.

17:09.125 --> 17:13.708
Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?

17:17.500 --> 17:18.708
This is a nightmare.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.166
-

18:37.416 --> 18:38.416
SYLVIE: You.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.791
Shut the door,
we still got a situation here.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.750
You should be careful just jumping
into a stranger's car like that.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.500
-Watch out!
-I see it, I see it.

18:52.583 --> 18:56.333
-Really? You're driving right towards it.
-God, you really are one of you.

18:56.416 --> 18:57.416
Hang on.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.416
You bastard!
You led the wolves to our door.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.833
We prefer snakes to wolves.

19:13.916 --> 19:16.833
I've eaten both. They die just the same.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.708
Apologies, my liege.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.375
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

19:23.791 --> 19:24.791
About that...

19:25.750 --> 19:27.583
-You can't be serious.
-Come on.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.958
-What did you expect?
-That was not the bargain!

19:30.041 --> 19:33.333
I gave you our location.
In exchange for shelter and supplies,

19:33.416 --> 19:35.666
you give me your army
and I take the throne.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.958
PRESIDENT LOKI: Ah, yes.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.583
Not so good a bargain.

19:39.291 --> 19:44.041
How about this one? My army, my throne?

19:44.125 --> 19:45.416
About that.

19:46.666 --> 19:49.333
Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.833
-We had a deal!
-For God's sake.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.708
-

19:54.000 --> 19:55.916
Why the hell
is there an alligator in here?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.250
ALL: He's a Loki!

20:04.041 --> 20:06.333
-

20:31.125 --> 20:33.833
BOASTFUL LOKI: Glorious purpose!

20:37.166 --> 20:38.166
Come on.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.583
Take that, Loki!

20:55.916 --> 20:58.791
Damn it! Animals, animals!

20:59.458 --> 21:00.750
We lie and we cheat,

21:00.833 --> 21:03.916
we cut the throat of every person
who trusts us, and for what?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.291
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!

21:08.375 --> 21:09.541
We cannot change.

21:10.375 --> 21:13.875
We're broken,
every version of us. Forever.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.500
And whenever one of us
dares try to fix themselves,

21:17.583 --> 21:19.166
they're sent here to die.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.416
That's why I need to get out of here.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.916
Nothing can change
until the TVA is stopped.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.750
-And you trust her?
-She's the only one I do trust.

21:28.708 --> 21:32.708
And right now, I believe
she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.208
That's good enough for me.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.041
Okay, okay. We'll help you.

21:39.250 --> 21:44.541
But approaching Alioth
is a death sentence.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.958
We'll get you to it,
but that's as far as we go.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.166
All that time, I really believed
we were the good guys.

22:00.125 --> 22:03.583
Annihilating entire realities,
orphaning little girls,

22:03.666 --> 22:05.583
classic hero stuff.

22:05.666 --> 22:08.416
Well, I guess when you think
the ends justify the means,

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
there's not much you won't do.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.583
By the way, you did some annihilating too.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.583
-I did what I had to do.
-Yeah, so did I.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.333
You hunted me like a dog.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.541
I'm sorry about that.

22:26.291 --> 22:29.333
When I pruned myself,
I thought I might be able to find Loki.

22:30.541 --> 22:33.708
That storm, that thing,
it's likely already got him.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.208
You really believe that?

22:35.291 --> 22:36.541
It doesn't matter.

22:39.083 --> 22:42.250
The only thing that matters now
is getting out of here

22:42.333 --> 22:44.416
and finding out who's behind all of this.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.958
Great. How do we do that?

22:47.041 --> 22:48.208
We turn around.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.750
Turn around?
What, and go back to the angry cloud?

22:52.833 --> 22:55.583
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.750
We're going back to it.

23:08.791 --> 23:13.041
CLASSIC LOKI: I have to say, it feels odd
walking toward the gargantuan creature.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.375
Do you have a plan of action?

23:15.458 --> 23:19.333
Get inside, find its heart
or brain or whatever,

23:19.416 --> 23:22.416
-and then, you know, do it in.
-KID LOKI: I mean...

23:22.500 --> 23:25.375
Just because it's not complicated
doesn't mean it's bad.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.166
It also doesn't mean it's good.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.833
-See? He's on board.

23:31.916 --> 23:34.041
He's praying.
He thinks we're going to die.

23:42.791 --> 23:44.500
SAILOR: All hands to battle stations!

23:47.750 --> 23:49.625
Alioth is like any animal.

23:49.708 --> 23:51.750
He'll go after the big meal first.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.625
And while he's busy with that,
we can sneak around the back and...

24:07.666 --> 24:08.916
Fire!

24:24.041 --> 24:26.416
Okay.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.166
Maybe we, uh...

24:29.458 --> 24:31.416
think a bit more about this, huh?

24:33.666 --> 24:34.875
Car.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.125
-What?
-Along the horizon.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.208
LOKI: Is that bad?

24:38.291 --> 24:40.833
KID LOKI: Well, usually means
cannibalistic marauders

24:40.916 --> 24:42.416
or cannibalistic pirates.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.750
Delightful.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.125
Now they're slowing down.

24:48.041 --> 24:50.291
-What are they doing?
-Just stay on guard.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Sylvie.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.041
I don't understand.
Is he a coward or was he being brave?

25:00.125 --> 25:02.125
-I'm not too sure.
-Come on.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.166
You're alive.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.916
What happened? You okay?

25:14.083 --> 25:15.333
Mobius!

25:16.791 --> 25:19.458
-How did you...
-We thought you could do with some backup.

25:23.625 --> 25:26.416
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait,
these are my friends.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.583
Well, they're, um... How best to put this?

25:30.125 --> 25:33.291
Us as a child, us in the future,

25:33.375 --> 25:37.000
and us as an alligator.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.500
It's best not to question it.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.625
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.833
So you're all after
the giant cloud monster, too, then?

25:45.916 --> 25:48.791
Well, we haven't decided
how we're going to kill it, but...

25:48.875 --> 25:51.666
-Come again? Kill it?
-Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.375
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.208
-Yeah.
-And you went along with it?

25:55.291 --> 25:57.000
-KID LOKI: I had my doubts.
-Probably unsafe.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.416
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

25:59.500 --> 26:03.625
I think the person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

26:03.708 --> 26:04.708
And if they are,

26:04.791 --> 26:08.125
that thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.375
Okay, so, um, how do we get past
the guard dog?

26:11.458 --> 26:12.458
I'm gonna enchant it.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.208
-That's insane, right?
-As insane as what?

26:18.291 --> 26:20.083
-Paper-cutting a cloud to death?
-Listen,

26:20.166 --> 26:23.583
-I've been down here longer than you...
-I'm going to enchant it.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.833
She's pretty confident.

26:36.416 --> 26:37.458
Leave us.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.666
Why am I locked in here?

27:12.375 --> 27:13.958
You freed the Variant.

27:14.541 --> 27:17.875
-You were disloyal to the TVA.
-Disloyal?

27:17.958 --> 27:21.291
-Did you think you'd escape punishment?
-Disloyal to who?

27:23.041 --> 27:25.750
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers.
They weren't real.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.416
And why does that change anything?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.000
That changes everything!

27:29.791 --> 27:31.333
The people need to know the truth.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.333
No, the TVA needs stability.

27:33.416 --> 27:36.208
And until we figure out what's going on,
that is what it will get.

27:38.333 --> 27:41.500
So you need to tell me everything.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.125
What exactly do you want from me?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.166
You had a link with the Variant.

27:50.041 --> 27:52.000
I want you to tell me what drives her.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.791
Revenge drives her.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.291
Killing the Time-Keepers.

27:57.833 --> 28:00.625
But they turned out to be fake,
in case you forgot.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.000
So she'll be searching
for whomever created them.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.791
This isn't about protecting
the TVA at all, is it?

28:20.125 --> 28:23.166
You just want to find
whoever is behind all of this, too.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.250
You'll never find them.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.208
Not before she does.

28:33.291 --> 28:34.291
And why is that?

28:36.041 --> 28:37.375
You only want it.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.166
She needs it.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.083
Hey, y'all.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.333
I need all the files
on the founding of the TVA.

28:57.416 --> 28:59.291
Everything from the beginning of time.

28:59.375 --> 29:01.083
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

29:01.166 --> 29:03.875
Whoever created this place is in danger.

29:03.958 --> 29:05.083
I need to find them.

29:05.583 --> 29:07.666
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.333
CLASSIC LOKI:
You really don't remember him?

29:22.833 --> 29:25.208
MOBIUS: I mean,
the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

29:25.291 --> 29:28.375
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

29:28.958 --> 29:31.041
I mean, who's to say
he's even a Loki Variant?

29:33.041 --> 29:34.500
He is green, isn't he?

29:34.583 --> 29:36.041
I don't know, he could be lying.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.500
The long con. Of course, that just
makes him more likely to be a Loki.

29:40.375 --> 29:44.375
It's always the game within the game
with you guys, which I respect.

29:46.041 --> 29:47.041
KID LOKI: Mobius,

29:47.875 --> 29:50.791
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

29:51.875 --> 29:54.041
what exactly are you
getting yourself into?

29:57.500 --> 29:58.666
I don't know.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.916
I'd like to let people know the truth.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.250
So just like that,
you're turning on the very thing

30:05.333 --> 30:06.625
you devoted your life to.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.333
Well, it's never too late to change.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.166
I hope they know what they're doing.

30:17.875 --> 30:19.458
Mobius isn't so bad.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.750
Or so good.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.208
I think that's why we get along.

30:28.708 --> 30:29.916
He cares about you.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.125
-It's cold.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.541
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

30:56.541 --> 30:59.166
You could conjure me a new outfit.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.666
You have no idea how uncomfortable
something like this is.

31:10.666 --> 31:11.666
So...

31:12.291 --> 31:17.125
Mobius and his theory about...

31:17.208 --> 31:19.291
Right, right. About our nexus event.

31:19.375 --> 31:22.041
-Total rubbish, right?
-Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

31:22.125 --> 31:24.208
I don't mean that it wasn't a nice moment.

31:24.291 --> 31:26.250
No, it was great. It was really nice.

31:26.333 --> 31:28.458
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

31:28.541 --> 31:32.583
A hundred percent.
I mean, totally. Yeah.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.041
I don't know how to do this.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.416
I don't even know what we're doing.

31:46.916 --> 31:49.375
I don't have friends.

31:52.166 --> 31:53.166
I don't have...

31:56.333 --> 31:57.541
anyone.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.041
Well...

31:59.708 --> 32:01.541
there are more important things, right?

32:02.250 --> 32:05.375
Right? Yeah.
Like bringing down the TVA.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.000
Saving the universe, even.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.791
Well, there's no need to be dramatic,
but, yeah, kind of.

32:28.291 --> 32:29.500
It's not very snuggly.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.125
Okay.
-Is it a tablecloth?

32:32.208 --> 32:33.958
No, it's a blanket.

32:37.666 --> 32:38.666
Thank you.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.416
My pleasure.

32:55.875 --> 32:59.125
How do I know that, in the final moments,
you won't betray me?

32:59.958 --> 33:01.250
Listen, Sylvie, I...

33:05.666 --> 33:07.583
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

33:08.791 --> 33:11.041
I betrayed my father, my brother...

33:12.416 --> 33:13.416
my home.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.666
I know what I did.

33:19.375 --> 33:20.750
And I know why I did it.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.250
And that's not who I am anymore.

33:26.833 --> 33:27.833
Okay?

33:29.041 --> 33:30.333
I won't let you down.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.500
You sure?

33:35.500 --> 33:38.541
'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone,

33:39.583 --> 33:41.625
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

33:41.791 --> 33:42.791
Ah.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.708
And then I'd finally be happy.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.500
What about you?

33:53.791 --> 33:55.791
What will you do when this is all over?

34:00.500 --> 34:01.500
I don't know.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.291
I don't know either.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.250
Maybe...

34:13.375 --> 34:15.416
Maybe we could figure it out...

34:17.666 --> 34:18.666
together.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.250
Maybe.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.458
Okay, so what's the next move?

34:58.541 --> 35:00.583
SYLVIE: The TVA needs to be brought down.

35:01.541 --> 35:03.750
We don't know who created it
or where they are,

35:03.833 --> 35:05.750
but that thing out there does.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.291
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.

35:10.208 --> 35:13.291
It was brief,
but I caught a glimpse of something,

35:13.375 --> 35:16.458
and I think if I can get
close enough to it, I can enchant it,

35:16.541 --> 35:19.416
and it's gonna take me
to whoever's behind all of this.

35:34.833 --> 35:35.875
I'm staying.

35:39.708 --> 35:43.916
-Loki, I don't know if this is gonna work.
-You go, I go.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.958
It's happening, guys.
The branch will be right out there.

35:55.041 --> 35:56.875
MOBIUS: I'll give your regards
to Renslayer.

35:56.958 --> 35:58.208
Oh, please do.

35:58.291 --> 36:00.041
You boys want a ticket out of here?

36:00.125 --> 36:02.625
What? No. We're staying here.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.708
This is our home.

36:03.791 --> 36:06.375
-Are you sure? What about Alioth?

36:06.458 --> 36:08.708
We've survived this long.
We know what we're doing.

36:08.791 --> 36:11.958
Loki, you're gonna need this
on your journey.

36:12.541 --> 36:13.541
Go on.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.458
CLASSIC LOKI: Good luck.

36:33.541 --> 36:35.458
I hope you find what you're looking for.

36:46.541 --> 36:48.125
Looks like you got away in the end.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.083
I always do.

36:53.458 --> 36:56.000
What will you do at the TVA?

36:57.791 --> 36:59.375
Burn it to the ground.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.000
Thanks for the spark.

37:04.458 --> 37:06.666
Well, see you later, Loki.

37:19.583 --> 37:20.833
Thank you, my friend.

37:22.916 --> 37:24.166
You're my favorite.

37:45.833 --> 37:48.750
SYLVIE: When a branch appears,
Alioth will focus on it.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.083
That's when I'll enchant it.

38:47.333 --> 38:50.208
What if we don't have time
to wait for a branch?

38:50.291 --> 38:52.208
We'll have to cause a distraction.

39:19.333 --> 39:20.750
Come and get me!

39:40.916 --> 39:43.125
No! This way!

39:43.208 --> 39:44.750
Come and get me!

39:46.083 --> 39:48.666
-No! No!

40:18.416 --> 40:19.916
How is he doing that?

40:21.166 --> 40:23.500
I think we're stronger than we realize.

40:32.916 --> 40:34.000
Go!

40:44.833 --> 40:46.041
What are you doing?

40:46.125 --> 40:48.083
SYLVIE: We're gonna enchant it.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.875
LOKI: I don't know how.

40:49.958 --> 40:51.000
SYLVIE: You do.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.708
Because we're the same!

42:11.416 --> 42:13.333
Glorious purpose!

42:55.750 --> 42:57.000
Open your eyes.
