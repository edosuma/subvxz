00:44.559 --> 00:49.302
Blow, winds!
And crack your cheeks!

00:49.535 --> 00:50.798
Rain!

00:50.839 --> 00:52.545
Blow... you cataracts

00:52.546 --> 00:53.982
and hurricanes,

00:54.356 --> 00:58.664
spout till you have
drenched our steeples...

01:00.444 --> 01:01.531
Dad.

01:01.532 --> 01:03.843
I know what you're asking,
and the answer is yes.

01:03.844 --> 01:05.315
Yes, you can take
your grandmother

01:05.316 --> 01:08.099
and her entire production of
"King Lear" to college with you.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.507
I'm going crazy.

01:09.508 --> 01:10.259
Ear plugs?

01:10.260 --> 01:11.906
Not that.
I need something to do.

01:11.907 --> 01:15.491
I had planned to be at Stanford,
but now I'm here, just waiting.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.418
What about school?

01:16.419 --> 01:18.780
I finished all my credits.
All I'm taking this semester is...

01:18.781 --> 01:20.019
Theoretical physics.

01:20.020 --> 01:22.931
Well, maybe this is
exactly what you need--

01:22.932 --> 01:25.253
a little time off to
discover yourself--

01:25.254 --> 01:26.957
travel, adventure.

01:26.958 --> 01:28.934
Go for a little life experience.

01:29.134 --> 01:30.472
That's a great idea.

01:30.686 --> 01:32.077
I could get an internship.

01:32.078 --> 01:33.795
Practical experience
in the job market,

01:33.796 --> 01:35.306
you know, test the waters.

01:35.307 --> 01:37.328
Well, not exactly
what I was thinking--

01:37.329 --> 01:39.851
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.
Thank you. Mwah.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.648
Blow, wind!

01:43.649 --> 01:46.088
Thunder, fire are my daughters!

01:46.089 --> 01:47.329
Daughters...

01:47.539 --> 01:49.393
That's why King Lear went mad.

01:52.803 --> 01:53.898
Yes, hello?

01:54.079 --> 01:55.504
Your timing was perfect.

01:55.505 --> 01:57.714
My mother was teaching three
acting classes today,

01:57.715 --> 01:58.745
in my living room.

01:58.746 --> 02:00.191
Wait a minute.
What about her studio?

02:00.192 --> 02:02.793
Flooded. They were doing the
storm from "King Lear,"

02:02.794 --> 02:05.124
and things got... out of hand.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.924
Remind me to check my insurance.

02:08.681 --> 02:10.305
Hey, Lanie, what do you got?

02:10.306 --> 02:12.386
This is Laura Cambridge, 28.

02:12.387 --> 02:14.858
Traffic found her in the
passenger seat of the car.

02:14.859 --> 02:15.890
Cause of death?

02:15.891 --> 02:16.525
She was strangled

02:16.526 --> 02:19.041
between the hours of 8:00
and 10:00 last night.

02:19.042 --> 02:21.289
This bruising here
indicates a choke hold.

02:21.290 --> 02:22.605
He probably grabbed
her from behind

02:22.606 --> 02:25.049
with enough force to
crush her hyoid bone.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.874
He? So there was a witness?

02:26.875 --> 02:30.011
No, but to kill her in one
swift move like that,

02:30.012 --> 02:32.516
perp had to be taller and
heavier than the victim.

02:32.524 --> 02:34.396
No signs of sexual
assault, though.

02:34.397 --> 02:35.694
Was she strangled in the car?

02:35.695 --> 02:38.503
CSU cidn't find any
signs of any struggle.

02:38.504 --> 02:40.763
Looks like her body was
dumped here postmortem.

02:40.777 --> 02:41.783
Whose car is it?

02:41.784 --> 02:42.640
Not hers.

02:42.641 --> 02:44.665
She had a non-driver ID card.

02:44.666 --> 02:47.099
Ryan's running the plates to
see if we can find the owner.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.575
And what about the purse?

02:48.576 --> 02:51.350
This was tossed in the dumpster.
Still has cash in it.

02:51.351 --> 02:52.465
Cell phone?

02:52.554 --> 02:53.575
Didn't find one.

02:53.576 --> 02:55.559
What girl in her 20s
doesn't have a cell phone?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.849
Maybe she's Amish.

02:57.504 --> 02:58.432
Hey.

02:58.624 --> 03:02.041
So I, um, ran those
plates off the sedan.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.167
And, uh...

03:03.168 --> 03:04.215
What?

03:04.545 --> 03:06.510
It's from the motor
pool at City Hall.

03:06.511 --> 03:07.713
City Hall?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.728
Who used it last?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.127
Mayor Robert Weldon.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.913
Uh, we're all still
a little stunned

03:17.914 --> 03:20.008
to hear that one of our
cars was mixed up in this.

03:20.009 --> 03:22.169
Trust me. We're gonna get
this all sorted out.

03:23.636 --> 03:24.786
Is that the victim?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.811
Yes. Laura Cambridge.

03:27.099 --> 03:28.851
Do you recognize
her, your honor?

03:28.852 --> 03:30.423
Uh, my staff would know better,

03:30.424 --> 03:32.347
but I don't believe she's
connected with this office.

03:32.450 --> 03:34.361
Sir, I'm sorry to
have to ask you this,

03:34.362 --> 03:37.210
but where were you last night
between 8:00 and 10:00 PM?

03:37.211 --> 03:38.898
This is one of New York's
finest, huh, Ricky?

03:38.899 --> 03:39.798
She's the best.

03:39.799 --> 03:41.579
Yeah, so you keep telling me.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.286
I was at a small
fund-raiser last night

03:43.287 --> 03:44.416
with about 50 other people.

03:44.417 --> 03:45.975
I'll--I'll get you their names.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.728
Yeah, I appreciate that.
And what about the car?

03:47.729 --> 03:50.180
It was one of several used
by my office for the event.

03:50.181 --> 03:51.925
Uh, apparently, one
of my staffers

03:51.926 --> 03:53.990
reported it stolen
later that night.

03:55.379 --> 03:56.644
Off the record?

03:57.325 --> 03:58.537
The people I was with last night

03:58.538 --> 03:59.821
were part of my inner circle.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.444
We're forming an
exploratory committee

04:01.445 --> 04:02.980
for a possible run at governor.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.156
But--but I'm not anxious
to make that public yet.

04:05.157 --> 04:05.743
I'll do my best

04:05.744 --> 04:07.415
to keep the nature of
your business private.

04:07.416 --> 04:10.002
Thanks.
I hoped you'd be there, Rick.

04:10.003 --> 04:12.502
Fondue night with Alexis,
but I did send a check.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.774
Thank you for that.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.368
I know that you have a lot
more questions, detective.

04:16.369 --> 04:18.331
My chief of staff, Brian Shay,
will answer anything else

04:18.332 --> 04:19.194
you want to know.

04:19.321 --> 04:21.550
- Listen--listen-- listen to me, Jack.
- I'm listening.

04:21.551 --> 04:23.061
You're swinging in
the wind on this,

04:23.062 --> 04:25.191
but you get me three more
votes on the council,

04:25.192 --> 04:27.135
and I'll send you a helicopter.

04:29.293 --> 04:30.442
You're the detective, right?

04:30.443 --> 04:31.787
- Yes.
- Have a seat.

04:31.788 --> 04:33.483
Jordan, we don't
need you in on this.

04:33.484 --> 04:35.501
You know, I'll--I'll leave you
guys to work through this

04:35.502 --> 04:36.395
unless, Rick, you
want to take a look

04:36.396 --> 04:37.918
at our new library initiative.

04:37.919 --> 04:39.581
It wouldn't hurt us to have
your endorsement on that.

04:39.582 --> 04:43.445
For the New York Public Library,
my first love? Anything.

04:44.805 --> 04:47.118
I've already done your
leg work, detective.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.534
The car was checked out
by Elizabeth Watson,

04:49.535 --> 04:52.046
senior director of communication
here at the office.

04:52.047 --> 04:53.013
When she left

04:53.014 --> 04:55.006
last night's event
around midnight,

04:55.007 --> 04:56.807
she discovered that
it was missing.

04:56.814 --> 04:57.797
Here's her statement.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.440
With all due respect, Mr. Shay,

04:59.441 --> 05:01.823
police investigations are usually
conducted by the police.

05:01.824 --> 05:05.266
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
the 24-hour news cycle moves

05:05.267 --> 05:07.123
a hell of a lot
faster than you do.

05:07.124 --> 05:09.141
And I have to get all
my ducks in a row

05:09.142 --> 05:10.769
before this thing breaks.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.014
It's my job.

05:12.015 --> 05:14.238
And my job is to find
Laura's murderer,

05:14.239 --> 05:16.824
so if you don't mind,
and even if you do,

05:16.825 --> 05:20.229
I'm gonna get my own statement from
Ms. Watson about that car.

05:20.230 --> 05:21.591
And I'm also gonna
need statements

05:21.592 --> 05:22.919
from all of your staff

05:22.920 --> 05:25.066
as to whether they
recognize our victim.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.006
Knock yourself out.

05:27.363 --> 05:28.290
But trust me,

05:28.291 --> 05:29.731
you're wasting your time.

05:29.732 --> 05:31.034
It's my time to waste.

05:31.035 --> 05:32.465
Now I got a job to do.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.700
So do I. Let me be clear.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.331
Mayor Weldon is my priority.

05:37.524 --> 05:40.772
And I'm not about to let this
thing embolden his opponents

05:40.773 --> 05:43.142
and ruin everything
that we've built.

05:44.286 --> 05:45.195
He's right, you know?

05:45.196 --> 05:47.128
This thing gets out, and they're
not ready with a response,

05:47.129 --> 05:48.696
that's front-page
material for weeks.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.616
It's front-page news either way.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.688
If his staff wants
to minimize damage,

05:52.689 --> 05:54.673
they'll step back and
let me do my job.

05:54.674 --> 05:55.968
Step back?

05:56.026 --> 05:57.342
These are politicians.

05:57.343 --> 05:58.242
They can't order at a restaurant

05:58.243 --> 06:00.452
without two compromises
and an ultimatum.

06:00.453 --> 06:02.668
Beckett, my office.

06:06.314 --> 06:07.969
What did you find
out at City Hall?

06:07.970 --> 06:10.330
The staffer that
reported the car stolen

06:10.331 --> 06:12.202
is accounted for all last night,

06:12.203 --> 06:15.418
and no one in the mayor's office
seems to recognize our victim.

06:15.419 --> 06:18.041
So her ties to that vehicle
could be purely coincidental?

06:18.042 --> 06:19.593
That's entirely possible.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.620
Castle and the
mayor are friends,

06:22.621 --> 06:23.814
right?

06:23.951 --> 06:24.902
Sir?

06:24.989 --> 06:27.693
These investigations are
like juggling wet dynamite.

06:27.694 --> 06:30.719
One misstep, and it'll all
blow up in your face.

06:30.831 --> 06:31.986
I can handle myself.

06:31.987 --> 06:33.268
Well, that's good, detective,

06:33.269 --> 06:35.726
because I won't be the
only one watching.

06:41.197 --> 06:41.997
What was that about?

06:41.998 --> 06:43.191
Politics...

06:43.917 --> 06:45.724
And your connection
to the mayor.

06:45.725 --> 06:47.910
Oh, what does it matter?
We know he's not involved.

06:49.275 --> 06:50.253
What?

06:52.406 --> 06:54.205
She's right. You are biased.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.550
I'm biased?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.939
Do you know who Gates voted
for in the last election?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.644
Because I'm betting
it wasn't Weldon.

07:01.525 --> 07:02.259
Espo,

07:02.260 --> 07:03.517
where are we on that motor pool?

07:03.518 --> 07:04.434
Verification.

07:04.435 --> 07:05.599
Vehicle was checked out at 5:00,

07:05.600 --> 07:07.262
reported missing shortly
after midnight.

07:07.263 --> 07:08.662
So it was stolen off the street.

07:08.663 --> 07:09.592
Looks like.

07:09.593 --> 07:11.984
Which means, any connection
to the City Hall

07:11.985 --> 07:13.399
is entirely coincidental.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.482
Hey, Ryan. What do our
victim's phone records show?

07:16.483 --> 07:17.832
Any phone calls to City Hall?

07:17.833 --> 07:19.071
No phone calls at all,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.123
because Laura Cambridge
didn't own a cell phone.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.346
And her credit cards haven't
been used in six months.

07:24.347 --> 07:26.345
No cell phone and
no credit cards?

07:26.420 --> 07:27.904
It's like she's from
another century.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.713
Amish theory's looking
pretty good, bro.

07:29.849 --> 07:30.951
Be nice if it were that easy.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.577
But I think something else
was going on with her.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.269
What do you mean?

07:33.270 --> 07:35.701
Laura was a professor of
literature at Hudson University.

07:35.702 --> 07:37.352
She was a rising star
in her department

07:37.353 --> 07:38.827
until six months ago.

07:38.828 --> 07:39.898
What happened six months ago?

07:39.899 --> 07:42.252
She quit for no apparent reason.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.216
According to her colleagues,

07:43.217 --> 07:45.113
she also completely
cut ties with them,

07:45.114 --> 07:47.202
canceled her cell phone,
cut off her credit cards.

07:47.203 --> 07:47.850
Why?

07:47.851 --> 07:49.976
No one knows.
It's like something happened to her.

07:49.977 --> 07:51.447
After that, all I could
find were paystubs

07:51.448 --> 07:53.001
for fast-food restaurants,

07:53.002 --> 07:55.783
a laundry service, and an
office cleaning company.

07:55.784 --> 07:57.195
It's like she
couldn't keep a job.

07:57.196 --> 07:58.969
She went from professor

07:59.290 --> 08:00.103
to janitor?

08:00.104 --> 08:02.809
That's "Good Will Hunting"
but in reverse.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.586
Maybe her family can
shed some light.

08:04.587 --> 08:05.936
Well, I tracked down
her next of kin.

08:05.937 --> 08:07.807
She has a sister.
She's on her way in now.

08:07.808 --> 08:09.093
All right, you guys
dig in to her life,

08:09.094 --> 08:10.697
see if we can find out where
she was the night she died.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.258
Castle and I will go
over to her apartment

08:12.259 --> 08:14.249
to see if we can find
out who she was with.

08:14.308 --> 08:17.592
Well, honestly, she pretty
much kept to herself.

08:17.849 --> 08:20.595
She paid on time.
That's what matters.

08:20.688 --> 08:22.688
That's my stuff!
You took my stuff!

08:22.689 --> 08:25.195
Unlike those two chuckleheads.

08:25.469 --> 08:27.551
Uh, excuse me, please, officer,

08:27.552 --> 08:29.291
and, uh, gentleman.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.863
Hey, pipe down, for
crying out loud!

08:31.864 --> 08:33.328
"Officer And A Gentleman."

08:33.328 --> 08:35.304
That could be the name
of our crime blog.

08:35.304 --> 08:36.336
Crime blog?

08:36.337 --> 08:38.597
The way that you help me
write police reports?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.895
Got a feeling I'll be
writing that one on my own.

08:42.168 --> 08:44.105
Doesn't really seem to be
any signs of struggle.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.365
Yeah, no sign of a TV
or computer either.

08:46.366 --> 08:47.612
That's weird, right?

08:47.613 --> 08:49.714
Bunch of deadbeat
tenants in here.

08:49.715 --> 08:51.376
You ever get bored, I'm
sure I could fill up

08:51.377 --> 08:52.940
a couple of holding
cells for you.

08:52.941 --> 08:55.037
Mr. Harvey, when was the
last time you saw Laura?

08:55.038 --> 08:57.056
- Did you see her yesterday?
- During the day.

08:57.057 --> 09:00.305
She worked nights.
I saw her head to work around 5:00.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.272
Do you know where she worked?

09:01.273 --> 09:03.442
Someplace that paid.
That's all I know.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.619
Did you ever see Laura with
any friends, boyfriends?

09:05.620 --> 09:06.823
No. Unh-unh.

09:06.824 --> 09:09.176
Uh, but I did see a guy
leaving here last night.

09:09.177 --> 09:09.977
When was that?

09:09.978 --> 09:12.358
Around 9... 30.

09:12.359 --> 09:14.393
Well, that's inside our 8:00 to
10:00 PM murder window.

09:14.394 --> 09:15.503
Do you remember what
he looked like?

09:15.504 --> 09:17.575
Uh, 6 feet tall,

09:17.664 --> 09:19.791
Caucasian, dark hair.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.969
She never mentioned
anyone like that.

09:22.385 --> 09:23.993
She wasn't dating anyone.

09:23.994 --> 09:24.696
Thank you.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.215
I tried to set her
up with a few guys,

09:26.216 --> 09:28.046
but she wasn't interested.

09:28.047 --> 09:28.870
Did your sister have

09:28.871 --> 09:31.791
any connection to City
Hall or local politics?

09:31.792 --> 09:33.399
No, I don't think so.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.711
Were you and your sister close?

09:34.712 --> 09:35.747
We used to be.

09:35.748 --> 09:37.267
She used to tell me everything.

09:37.268 --> 09:39.571
And then... six months ago,

09:39.572 --> 09:41.314
she stopped calling.

09:41.442 --> 09:44.346
She just...
dropped out of her life.

09:44.347 --> 09:46.289
She gave up her
teaching position,

09:46.290 --> 09:48.914
she moved out of her apartment
on the Upper West Side

09:48.915 --> 09:50.353
into that flophouse.

09:50.354 --> 09:51.858
Do you have any idea why?

09:52.802 --> 09:54.306
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

09:54.307 --> 09:55.346
Three days ago.

09:55.347 --> 09:57.102
She called for my birthday.

09:57.362 --> 09:58.810
From where?

09:58.811 --> 09:59.977
She didn't have a phone.

09:59.978 --> 10:02.235
I don't know, but she was upset.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.498
She said she was in trouble

10:04.499 --> 10:06.610
because of something
that happened at work.

10:06.611 --> 10:07.585
Did she tell you why?

10:07.586 --> 10:10.427
No. She said it was too
dangerous for me to know.

10:12.117 --> 10:15.274
So Laura Cambridge left
a tenure-track position

10:15.275 --> 10:17.453
at a respected university
for some flophouse

10:17.454 --> 10:19.822
and a mysterious night job that
got her into so much trouble,

10:19.823 --> 10:21.190
she ended up murdered.

10:21.225 --> 10:22.624
What the hell was
she mixed up in?

10:22.625 --> 10:24.200
The man who left her apartment--

10:24.201 --> 10:26.405
if he's our killer, he
was looking for her.

10:26.406 --> 10:28.132
He probably went to
her work to find her.

10:28.133 --> 10:29.190
Which means, wherever that is,

10:29.191 --> 10:30.574
it's probably the last
place she was seen alive.

10:30.621 --> 10:32.535
I got it.
I found where she works.

10:32.556 --> 10:34.050
Her bank statement
says she received

10:34.051 --> 10:36.396
recent direct deposits from
a DAG Corp.

10:36.397 --> 10:38.433
Now I had to dig deep within the
city's business registries,

10:38.434 --> 10:41.272
but I found one listing for
a DAG Corp

10:41.273 --> 10:43.130
between 2nd and 3rd
in the Bowery.

10:43.131 --> 10:43.994
Let's go.

10:46.547 --> 10:48.067
There it is. Suite 250.

10:48.068 --> 10:49.866
What kind of business
do you think this is--

10:49.867 --> 10:52.252
shadowy import/export,
money laundering,

10:52.253 --> 10:53.403
sweatshop?

10:53.491 --> 10:54.282
Shh.

10:54.283 --> 10:56.645
No, please.

10:56.916 --> 10:57.441
Do you hear that?

10:57.442 --> 10:59.846
Stop it. You're hurting me.

11:02.715 --> 11:03.686
Bobby?

11:05.795 --> 11:06.780
Stop!

11:07.092 --> 11:08.099
Stop!

11:09.177 --> 11:10.288
Aah!

11:10.473 --> 11:12.795
- Aah!
- NYPD, no...

11:12.796 --> 11:14.546
I'm a bad little schoolgirl.

11:18.557 --> 11:20.127
It's just an office.

11:21.909 --> 11:23.438
Where only women work?

11:23.439 --> 11:25.314
Oh, yeah, baby. I'm still here.

11:25.763 --> 11:27.140
What is this place?

11:29.821 --> 11:32.818
I'd say it's about
$4.99 a minute.

11:33.419 --> 11:34.660
It's not a sweatshop.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.165
It's a sex shop.

11:41.883 --> 11:45.599
Oh, Murray. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, like that.

11:55.701 --> 11:57.403
You hear the clicking
of stilettos

11:57.404 --> 11:59.115
coming towards you, James?

11:59.116 --> 12:01.219
Farm, no men for miles.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.238
- Could you stay and... 
- Vampire

12:02.239 --> 12:05.046
with sharp teeth for
to hold you down

12:05.047 --> 12:06.664
while I suck your...

12:06.665 --> 12:08.336
Laura was one of my favorites.

12:08.983 --> 12:12.213
Just a sweet, intelligent,
funny girl.

12:12.495 --> 12:13.881
She'd only been
here a few months,

12:13.882 --> 12:16.564
and already, she was one of
our most popular goddesses.

12:16.757 --> 12:18.565
I can't believe that she's dead.

12:18.588 --> 12:20.828
Was she taking calls last night?

12:20.934 --> 12:22.829
No. No, she took last night off.

12:22.830 --> 12:24.771
Said she had something
to take care of.

12:24.772 --> 12:27.755
Laura told her sister that
she was in trouble at work,

12:27.756 --> 12:29.051
that something had happened.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.873
Nothing happened that I know of.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.026
I mean, she did seem
distracted the past few days,

12:33.027 --> 12:34.041
but that's about all.

12:34.042 --> 12:35.484
Well, being the chief...

12:36.293 --> 12:38.083
"sexecutive officer,"

12:38.084 --> 12:41.507
did you notice any conflicts
with her and her colleagues?

12:41.508 --> 12:42.701
Well, she kept to herself.

12:42.702 --> 12:44.539
But she got along well
with the other girls.

12:44.596 --> 12:46.235
There were no
complaints about Laura.

12:46.236 --> 12:48.300
Did she ever tell you why
she was working here?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.039
What do you mean?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.280
I-I just find it odd.

12:50.281 --> 12:52.765
She's a professor with a
promising career ahead of her,

12:52.766 --> 12:53.624
and then all of the sudden,

12:53.625 --> 12:56.232
she decides to become
a phone sex operator.

12:56.450 --> 12:57.751
Maybe she liked it.

12:57.752 --> 12:59.176
We get all types
here, detective--

12:59.177 --> 13:01.753
students, actresses, moms.

13:01.809 --> 13:04.488
I knew an accountant who did it
because she liked the challenge

13:04.641 --> 13:06.102
and it turned her on.

13:06.378 --> 13:07.212
It's a powerful thing

13:07.213 --> 13:09.336
to make a client lust for you.

13:10.072 --> 13:11.056
Hmm.

13:12.539 --> 13:14.053
Any chance that one
of her clients

13:14.054 --> 13:15.099
became obsessed with her?

13:15.100 --> 13:17.209
Oh, honey, obsession
pays our bills.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.999
Could they have found
out her real identity,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.174
maybe contacted her?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.350
Absolutely not.

13:21.351 --> 13:23.521
No, we keep all of
our girls anonymous.

13:23.522 --> 13:25.400
Clients can't be
contacted directly.

13:25.401 --> 13:27.336
They call one central
line, and all our calls

13:27.337 --> 13:29.208
are routed to each girl
by our dispatcher.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.533
Uh, yeah, it's my job to take

13:31.534 --> 13:34.164
the client's name and
credit card information

13:34.165 --> 13:36.547
and then route the
calls to the girls.

13:36.548 --> 13:39.030
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.
Is it always this busy?

13:39.031 --> 13:39.796
Sure.

13:39.797 --> 13:41.178
Some guys need a morning jolt,

13:41.179 --> 13:43.004
some guys need an
afternoon pick-me-up.

13:43.005 --> 13:44.800
Someone shoulda told
them, coffee's cheaper.

13:44.801 --> 13:47.002
It's not just about the sex.

13:47.003 --> 13:50.026
That's the part of this business
most people don't understand.

13:50.749 --> 13:52.747
Guys call, girls call,

13:52.748 --> 13:54.396
they're looking for release.

13:54.397 --> 13:57.092
Sometimes that release is
sexual, but sometimes--

13:57.093 --> 13:58.315
It's therapy.

13:59.299 --> 14:01.923
Or... so I've been told.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.778
It's true.

14:02.779 --> 14:04.555
Laura was a successful goddess

14:04.556 --> 14:06.218
not just because
of her sexy talk,

14:06.219 --> 14:08.482
but because she was a
really good listener.

14:08.483 --> 14:10.030
Well, that might have
gotten her killed.

14:10.031 --> 14:13.114
Sarah, were there any clients
that she asked to have blocked?

14:14.155 --> 14:14.968
No.

14:14.969 --> 14:16.490
What about problems
here at work?

14:16.491 --> 14:18.419
Was there anything she
couldn't tell her boss about?

14:19.674 --> 14:21.586
No. She, um...

14:23.226 --> 14:24.313
She what?

14:26.146 --> 14:28.003
- Sarah?
- I'm sorry.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.012
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.780
It's my fault she's dead.

14:32.975 --> 14:33.941
How?

14:34.220 --> 14:35.979
Did a client find
out who she was?

14:35.980 --> 14:39.659
No. It was the other way around.

14:40.381 --> 14:42.705
Laura came to me
about a week ago.

14:43.172 --> 14:45.763
She, um, she wanted a-a client's

14:45.764 --> 14:47.074
contact information.

14:47.075 --> 14:50.539
I told her it was
completely against policy.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.467
But she was desperate.

14:52.586 --> 14:54.900
She said it was a matter
of life and death.

14:55.835 --> 14:58.051
Okay, we're gonna need
that client's name.

14:58.723 --> 14:59.668
Edgar Navarro?

15:00.092 --> 15:00.942
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

15:01.232 --> 15:02.937
You had no right to drag me
out in front of my moms.

15:03.215 --> 15:06.152
No? Where were you last night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

15:07.554 --> 15:08.369
What's this about?

15:09.655 --> 15:13.502
- Do you recognize this woman?
- Hey, look, I--

15:13.503 --> 15:15.505
I don't know what she told you,
but all we did was talk.

15:15.647 --> 15:16.729
I didn't do nothin' illegal.

15:16.824 --> 15:17.930
Then how come she's dead?

15:19.572 --> 15:20.327
W-what?

15:20.565 --> 15:22.296
We know that she
called you, Edgar,

15:22.952 --> 15:24.149
and that the two of you met up.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.971
It's not what you think.
She just needed my help.

15:27.173 --> 15:28.805
What kind of help could
you have given her?

15:29.486 --> 15:31.228
I learned how to fix
computers in prison.

15:31.823 --> 15:32.946
That's why Laura called me.

15:33.078 --> 15:35.915
She needed me to copy some
digital recordings for her

15:35.916 --> 15:36.840
from their hard drive,

15:37.149 --> 15:38.343
but she didn't know
how to rip them.

15:38.476 --> 15:40.052
I told her I needed
the file extensions.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.209
She said she'd get them and
then call me from her cell

15:42.210 --> 15:44.951
- to walk her through it-- 
- Only she didn't even own a cell, Edgar.

15:44.952 --> 15:45.786
Yes, she did.

15:47.715 --> 15:48.843
That's her number right there.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.364
Did she tell you why she
needed those files copied?

15:53.492 --> 15:55.045
She said she'd heard
something on a call,

15:55.325 --> 15:56.986
something she wasn't
supposed to hear.

15:58.824 --> 15:59.727
Something bad.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.357
She said she needed a
copy of it for evidence.

16:04.244 --> 16:06.307
So Laura never mentioned
a call that upset

16:06.308 --> 16:07.387
or concerned her?

16:07.492 --> 16:08.566
She never said a word.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.311
And she never asked for
copies of recordings?

16:10.526 --> 16:11.832
No, and I'm the one to ask.

16:11.957 --> 16:13.492
This computer room
is locked up tight,

16:13.493 --> 16:14.692
and I'm the only one with a key.

16:18.414 --> 16:19.302
The lock's broken.

16:30.856 --> 16:31.526
Okay.

16:33.998 --> 16:34.896
The hard drive's gone.

16:35.422 --> 16:37.868
All of our calls for the last
two months were on that drive.

16:38.029 --> 16:39.266
When was the last time
you were in here?

16:39.278 --> 16:40.588
This morning.
Everything was fine.

16:41.035 --> 16:42.174
This must've just happened.

16:42.297 --> 16:43.984
Has anyone visited
the office today?

16:44.558 --> 16:45.320
Yes, a...

16:47.353 --> 16:48.587
A man from the gas company.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.836
He said there was a
leak in the building

16:50.837 --> 16:51.861
because of the construction.

16:52.001 --> 16:52.892
Can you describe him?

16:53.048 --> 16:55.951
Um, about 6 feet tall,
white, dark hair.

16:56.039 --> 16:57.929
Same guy who was at Laura's
apartment the night she died?

16:59.411 --> 17:00.822
What the hell was
on that recording?

17:01.761 --> 17:02.680
Whatever it is...

17:03.386 --> 17:04.489
it's worth killing for.

17:06.738 --> 17:07.738
So how is the case

17:07.826 --> 17:11.551
of the phone sex gal who
knew too much going?

17:11.553 --> 17:14.065
It's more of a
conspiracy thriller,

17:14.597 --> 17:16.749
like, uh, "The Conversation"
or "Blow Out."

17:17.750 --> 17:20.351
Everyone wants this recording
and the secrets on it.

17:20.354 --> 17:21.637
Oh, very mysterious.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.295
Yeah, and that's not
the only mystery.

17:23.734 --> 17:25.750
Why would a woman
like Laura Cambridge,

17:25.893 --> 17:27.752
a highly educated professor,

17:27.753 --> 17:30.214
suddenly quit everything and
just drop out of her life

17:30.215 --> 17:32.166
for a series of menial jobs

17:32.521 --> 17:35.525
culminating in the wonderful
world of phone sex?

17:36.683 --> 17:37.630
None of the pieces fit.

17:37.631 --> 17:39.160
Hmm. Who called her?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.033
I mean, you must be
able to trace the call

17:41.034 --> 17:42.937
even though you don't have
the recording, right?

17:42.938 --> 17:44.931
Well, we have subpoenaed a
list of all the incoming calls

17:44.932 --> 17:45.527
on Laura's shifts,

17:45.528 --> 17:48.423
but that's gonna be like looking
for a needle in a needle stack.

17:52.050 --> 17:52.590
Hello.

17:53.595 --> 17:54.499
Mr. Castle...

17:55.838 --> 17:56.871
Do you remember me?

17:58.138 --> 17:59.249
I called you before.

18:00.144 --> 18:01.879
About detective
Beckett's safety.

18:03.597 --> 18:04.407
I remember.

18:05.182 --> 18:06.548
Once again, Mr. Castle,

18:07.439 --> 18:08.983
it seems that we need to talk.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.169
Are you sure it's the same man

18:16.189 --> 18:17.435
who called you about Beckett?

18:17.505 --> 18:18.584
It's definitely him.

18:18.808 --> 18:20.055
Then the death of
this young woman

18:20.056 --> 18:21.913
is somehow connected
to Beckett's mother?

18:21.914 --> 18:23.581
It has to be, otherwise
why would he call?

18:23.666 --> 18:24.476
What did he say?

18:25.132 --> 18:27.609
He said that there were
greater forces at play,

18:27.788 --> 18:29.773
that more was at stake
than we realize.

18:30.241 --> 18:32.510
Clearly this is not
just about phone sex.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.266
Whatever Laura Cambridge
overheard that night,

18:34.712 --> 18:36.468
it got someone's
attention, someone big.

18:36.803 --> 18:39.740
What I don't get is, what are
you supposed to do about it?

18:39.741 --> 18:40.473
I don't know.

18:40.474 --> 18:42.254
He gave me a number
to contact him

18:42.444 --> 18:44.169
- if I needed help.
- Hmm.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.767
He said I would know
when it was time.

18:47.735 --> 18:48.818
You plan to tell Beckett?

18:49.148 --> 18:50.512
Tell her what? "Hey, Kate.

18:50.513 --> 18:52.505
I've been taking calls
from a shadowy figure

18:52.506 --> 18:54.200
who wants to keep you off
your mother's murder case

18:54.528 --> 18:55.895
so they don't kill you, too"?

18:58.928 --> 19:00.635
Yeah. Okay.

19:01.521 --> 19:02.477
Hold on. Wait.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.388
What did you say?

19:04.015 --> 19:05.075
No, I'm not eating.

19:09.084 --> 19:09.766
Thanks.

19:12.389 --> 19:13.889
Hey. You're just in time.

19:14.562 --> 19:15.271
Thank you.

19:16.993 --> 19:17.820
What's wrong?

19:18.457 --> 19:19.136
Nothing.

19:21.215 --> 19:22.205
So what have we got?

19:22.250 --> 19:23.663
Lanie just called.

19:24.013 --> 19:26.590
She said that she found
fibers in Laura's mouth

19:26.591 --> 19:27.723
and esophagus.

19:27.724 --> 19:29.644
The lab IDed it as
light brown cashmere,

19:29.645 --> 19:32.451
which was most likely from
our killer's coat sleeve.

19:32.452 --> 19:33.613
Brown cashmere.

19:33.615 --> 19:34.879
So we can narrow
our suspects down

19:34.880 --> 19:36.902
to rich men with
impeccable taste.

19:36.990 --> 19:38.166
Are you saying,
you're a suspect?

19:38.477 --> 19:39.845
Alexis is my alibi.

19:39.866 --> 19:41.367
What about our gas
company worker?

19:41.368 --> 19:44.112
Well, surprise--he doesn't
work for the gas company.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.604
And uniforms said that there
was no forensic evidence

19:47.828 --> 19:49.922
at the dial-a-goddess office.

19:49.954 --> 19:51.805
But what we did get from
dial-a-goddess were

19:51.806 --> 19:55.783
their copious call logs--
about 200 pages worth.

19:55.815 --> 19:57.289
These ladies are busy.

19:57.304 --> 19:58.513
I've been going through
them all morning,

19:58.514 --> 20:00.713
trying to sort Laura's calls
from the other girls' lines.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.576
Are there any calls in there
from the mayor's office?

20:02.708 --> 20:03.590
I thought you said
you were confident

20:03.591 --> 20:04.598
that he wasn't involved?

20:04.599 --> 20:07.505
I'm just trying to be
thorough and impartial.

20:07.549 --> 20:08.245
Not yet,

20:08.585 --> 20:10.604
but the private sector
is well-represented.

20:10.605 --> 20:12.241
I got calls from the Met, banks,

20:12.607 --> 20:14.655
several high-profile
brokerage houses.

20:14.656 --> 20:16.093
No wonder the economy
collapsed, huh?

20:16.589 --> 20:17.384
Yo, Beckett.

20:18.431 --> 20:19.181
Excuse me.

20:21.499 --> 20:22.137
What do you got?

20:23.036 --> 20:23.680
Hey.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.937
If anything shows up in here

20:26.538 --> 20:28.580
and it's tied to either
Beckett's shooting

20:28.581 --> 20:31.998
or Johanna Beckett's murder,
would you tell me right away?

20:32.258 --> 20:34.361
Wait. You guys think
this is connected--

20:34.362 --> 20:35.217
No.

20:36.060 --> 20:36.895
Not you guys.

20:37.008 --> 20:38.882
Beckett doesn't know, and
I don't want her to know.

20:38.883 --> 20:40.113
Why do you think it's connected?

20:40.236 --> 20:40.956
I just...

20:42.444 --> 20:43.622
I just want to cover
all my bases.

20:44.571 --> 20:45.784
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:45.785 --> 20:46.895
- Thanks.
- You guys.

20:47.262 --> 20:49.573
So uniforms canvassing
around Laura's apartment

20:49.574 --> 20:51.499
found a cab that
recognized her pic.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.618
He said that two days
ago, he dropped her off

20:53.619 --> 20:55.918
at the Gotham 11 TV
Station downtown.

20:55.919 --> 20:57.349
A television station.

20:58.662 --> 21:00.086
Why would she go to a
television station?

21:00.167 --> 21:01.747
Why would she go into
the phone sex business?

21:01.748 --> 21:03.246
Why would she do any of
these things she did?

21:03.247 --> 21:05.097
Well, hopefully I'll get
some answers, but first,

21:05.179 --> 21:07.349
I ran down that cell number
we got from Edgar Navarro.

21:07.371 --> 21:08.791
It's a pay-as-you-go phone.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.722
Laura just activated
it six days ago.

21:10.869 --> 21:11.918
She's hardly used it.

21:12.113 --> 21:13.553
She made one call to Edgar

21:13.736 --> 21:15.594
and another on the day
she died to an agent.

21:15.904 --> 21:16.898
A federal agent?

21:16.917 --> 21:19.012
No, a book agent. Trevor Hanes.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.177
It's just absurdly tragic.

21:22.577 --> 21:24.606
Laura was an incredibly
talented writer.

21:26.094 --> 21:27.099
You were her agent?

21:27.100 --> 21:29.286
Yeah, we signed her as a
client about six months ago

21:29.554 --> 21:31.462
on the back of an
astonishing book proposal.

21:31.472 --> 21:32.315
What's the book about?

21:32.316 --> 21:34.681
It's a scathing indictment
of societal inequity

21:34.682 --> 21:36.719
as seen through the lens
of the working poor.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.263
A sort of contemporary take

21:38.264 --> 21:39.460
on how the other half lives.

21:39.494 --> 21:41.562
A privileged young woman
gives up every comfort

21:41.563 --> 21:43.124
to experience life below
the poverty line.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.491
That's why she took all those
jobs--firsthand research.

21:46.031 --> 21:47.352
The thing pitches itself really.

21:48.085 --> 21:50.678
So we'll need to see a
copy of that manuscript.

21:50.679 --> 21:52.586
Her investigations might
have led to her death.

21:52.747 --> 21:55.162
Well, there isn't one, at least
not that I've seen anyway.

21:56.406 --> 21:58.932
Bedsides...
I don't think she was killed

21:58.933 --> 22:00.713
because of her
anticapitalist polemic.

22:00.998 --> 22:01.778
What do you mean?

22:01.868 --> 22:03.568
Earlier this week, she
called my office,

22:04.181 --> 22:06.544
said she stumbled upon a
much more explosive story--

22:07.146 --> 22:08.883
a scandal involving
a very prominent,

22:09.034 --> 22:10.201
very powerful New Yorker.

22:10.865 --> 22:13.462
She said it would rock the
city to its very foundations.

22:14.914 --> 22:17.286
W-what--what prominent
New Yorker?

22:17.287 --> 22:18.076
She wouldn't say.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.537
I just assumed it was a
pitch for her next book.

22:20.932 --> 22:22.235
We were gonna discuss
it this week.

22:23.057 --> 22:23.926
Sorry. Excuse me.

22:26.153 --> 22:26.830
Hey, Espo.

22:27.109 --> 22:29.060
- What's up?
- I'm at the Gotham 11 office.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.320
There's something
you need to see.

22:30.844 --> 22:33.266
This is Pat McConnell,
Laura's college buddy.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.269
Tell 'em what you told me.

22:34.463 --> 22:36.227
Well, I hadn't seen
Laura in years.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.131
So a few days ago, she
calls me out of the blue,

22:38.216 --> 22:40.192
says she needs to see
some raw footage we shot

22:40.193 --> 22:42.303
for this research project
she's working on.

22:42.304 --> 22:43.799
So I set her up
at this edit bay.

22:43.979 --> 22:45.260
She was here for
over eight hours.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.388
I mean, at one point,
she even fell asleep.

22:47.756 --> 22:49.465
I came by to check on her,
she had her eyes closed.

22:49.531 --> 22:51.458
- Raw footage of what?
- It's all B-roll

22:51.594 --> 22:52.587
of Mayor Weldon--

22:52.937 --> 22:54.855
City Council meetings,
playground openings,

22:55.120 --> 22:56.803
backstage at a press conference.

22:56.855 --> 22:59.429
A scandal about a prominent,
powerful New Yorker.

22:59.799 --> 23:01.841
And check out this last
tape she was watching.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.100
That's the reading
train foundation.

23:08.101 --> 23:09.519
I went to their gala last year.

23:09.814 --> 23:11.461
Now look at the girl on
the side of the screen.

23:12.872 --> 23:13.789
That's Laura.

23:16.358 --> 23:18.141
That's impossible.
He said he didn't know her.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.708
Castle, look what the
mayor is wearing.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.662
It's a light brown coat, and
it looks like cashmere.

23:22.663 --> 23:24.401
That's just the coat that
our killer was wearing.

23:31.561 --> 23:33.305
Beckett, I know this man.

23:33.306 --> 23:35.613
I've known him 12 years.
He's not a killer.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.754
You don't know that.

23:36.899 --> 23:38.064
Yes, I do.

23:38.065 --> 23:40.578
Castle, he lied about
knowing our victim.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.191
He was standing next to her.

23:42.329 --> 23:43.739
That doesn't mean he knew her.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.664
You know how many people
he meets in a day?

23:46.015 --> 23:47.443
Expecting him to
remember them all--

23:47.444 --> 23:48.829
that's like expecting
me to remember

23:48.830 --> 23:50.168
everyone who comes
to my book signings.

23:50.169 --> 23:51.010
You're biased.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.338
You're damn right, I'm biased.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.052
Robert Weldon is a good man.

23:54.054 --> 23:57.485
Even good men make mistakes.
He had access to that car.

23:57.616 --> 23:59.687
His aide said that he left
the event at 9:00 PM.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.982
That's right inside
of our kill zone.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.893
Fine. What's his motive?

24:02.894 --> 24:04.677
I don't know, at least, not yet.

24:04.678 --> 24:05.849
Then give him a chance,

24:06.311 --> 24:08.133
because the minute
you move on him,

24:08.252 --> 24:09.394
his career is over.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.729
So... what's the latest?

24:19.312 --> 24:20.823
We've got a couple
of promising leads.

24:20.824 --> 24:22.517
I'm hoping to find
something concrete soon.

24:22.787 --> 24:24.138
Well, anything more
on the victim?

24:24.404 --> 24:26.487
Anything connecting her
back to City Hall?

24:27.942 --> 24:28.894
No, not yet.

24:29.272 --> 24:30.469
All right, detective.

24:30.819 --> 24:32.631
Anything pops, you let me know.

24:36.524 --> 24:38.295
Great. Now I'm a liar.

24:39.088 --> 24:40.006
You know what I think?

24:40.579 --> 24:41.865
I think she's hoping it's him,

24:42.162 --> 24:43.620
because if he's gone, I'm gone.

24:43.902 --> 24:45.382
Castle, you can't make
this one about you.

24:48.055 --> 24:48.837
Where are you going?

24:49.064 --> 24:51.058
You're right.
We have to figure out Weldon's motive.

24:51.059 --> 24:52.519
There's no way that
Gates is gonna let me

24:52.520 --> 24:54.000
subpoena that coat without it?

24:54.044 --> 24:55.725
Really, that's your takeaway?

24:56.810 --> 24:58.168
What do you want
me to do, Castle?

24:58.169 --> 24:59.154
I know that he's your friend,

24:59.155 --> 25:01.039
but I'm sorry, if he
killed that girl--

25:01.047 --> 25:02.748
- He didn't.
- Then let me prove it.

25:05.537 --> 25:06.148
Ryan?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.214
All right. Thanks for your help.

25:07.804 --> 25:08.909
Anything else on that video?

25:09.345 --> 25:10.226
Actually, yeah.

25:10.227 --> 25:13.470
When we first saw Laura, she
was wearing a volunteer badge

25:13.471 --> 25:14.852
for the reading
train foundation.

25:16.232 --> 25:18.054
She was on staff at
the mayor's charity.

25:18.437 --> 25:20.169
That doesn't mean he knew her.

25:22.387 --> 25:23.547
Ryan, you're with me.

25:24.121 --> 25:26.704
Castle, I'm sorry, but you can't
be objective on this one,

25:26.705 --> 25:28.420
so I'm gonna have to
pursue it on my own.

25:38.665 --> 25:41.013
No, uh, I don't know
if Mayor Weldon

25:41.014 --> 25:42.598
and Laura Cambridge
were acquainted.

25:42.599 --> 25:43.942
I don't know much
about her at all.

25:43.994 --> 25:45.217
She wasn't here very long.

25:45.623 --> 25:46.289
What do you mean?

25:46.511 --> 25:49.574
Well, we hired Laura as a
volunteer about a week ago.

25:49.995 --> 25:51.582
A few days later,
we had to fire her.

25:51.983 --> 25:52.549
Why?

25:53.151 --> 25:55.389
She was caught copying
confidential files.

25:55.961 --> 25:57.855
What kind of files?
Accounting files.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.372
Any idea why she would be
interested in those files?

26:04.346 --> 26:06.010
- Ms. Park?
- It's sensitive.

26:06.112 --> 26:07.554
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

26:07.665 --> 26:09.410
Ms. Park, a woman was murdered,

26:09.411 --> 26:10.996
and we are trying
to figure out why.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.887
You can talk to us here,
or we can go downtown.

26:19.802 --> 26:22.452
We've recently discovered some
discrepancies in our accounts.

26:22.967 --> 26:25.165
- We found there was some money missing.
- How much money?

26:25.264 --> 26:26.663
$2.3 million.

26:27.422 --> 26:29.668
There's an internal
investigation going on.

26:29.794 --> 26:30.614
This investigation,

26:30.615 --> 26:32.670
does it have anything to
do with Mayor Weldon?

26:34.288 --> 26:35.105
Thank you.

26:37.632 --> 26:39.022
Attorney General's
office confirms

26:39.042 --> 26:41.268
that Mayor Weldon is the
subject of the investigation.

26:41.463 --> 26:43.297
We were looking for
motive, and here it is--

26:43.298 --> 26:44.650
$2.3 million worth.

26:44.685 --> 26:46.907
Weldon embezzled from
his own charity.

26:46.908 --> 26:48.543
Someone must have
told Laura about it

26:48.544 --> 26:49.568
during one of her sessions,

26:49.569 --> 26:51.167
and she decided to investigate.

26:51.459 --> 26:53.479
When she found enough
evidence to expose the mayor,

26:53.480 --> 26:54.644
he killed her to shut her up.

26:59.863 --> 27:00.749
You gonna tell her?

27:01.604 --> 27:02.582
I have to.

27:03.868 --> 27:05.323
This will destroy
Weldon, you know?

27:05.396 --> 27:06.303
Yeah, I know.

27:06.513 --> 27:08.144
And when he's gone, the
first thing she'll do

27:09.118 --> 27:10.250
is get rid of Castle.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.256
I know.

27:29.846 --> 27:30.877
Are you sure about this?

27:31.130 --> 27:32.737
Yes, sir, but the moment

27:32.738 --> 27:35.190
I file a warrant
request for that coat,

27:35.191 --> 27:36.630
it becomes public record.

27:36.937 --> 27:37.618
So?

27:37.773 --> 27:39.125
So then everyone will know

27:39.126 --> 27:41.066
that Mayor Weldon is a
person of interest.

27:41.628 --> 27:42.478
Isn't he?

27:42.511 --> 27:43.214
Yes, but...

27:45.541 --> 27:46.549
what if I'm wrong?

27:47.794 --> 27:49.186
It could ruin his career.

27:50.771 --> 27:52.857
We... are tasked

27:52.858 --> 27:54.053
by the city of New York

27:54.054 --> 27:55.163
to protect its people.

27:55.823 --> 27:58.006
Sometimes that task
comes with a cost.

28:00.018 --> 28:01.630
I know what they
call me, detective--

28:01.809 --> 28:03.045
"Iron Gates."

28:03.534 --> 28:04.753
I hear the whispers.

28:05.162 --> 28:07.625
"She's from IA.
She must hate cops."

28:08.370 --> 28:09.354
Well, the truth is,

28:10.112 --> 28:11.239
I love cops.

28:13.337 --> 28:14.737
My daddy was a cop.

28:15.044 --> 28:16.500
My uncles were cops.

28:18.316 --> 28:20.687
But the sergeant who
assaulted my patrol partner

28:20.688 --> 28:22.018
under the color or authority...

28:23.081 --> 28:24.585
Who holds him accountable?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.109
We do.

28:29.682 --> 28:30.715
Go to the mayor,

28:31.075 --> 28:33.459
get him to voluntarily
surrender his coat

28:33.460 --> 28:35.182
for fiber testing
without a warrant.

28:35.325 --> 28:37.921
Tell him it's the only way
to keep it out of the media.

28:38.378 --> 28:39.671
But if he refuses,

28:41.117 --> 28:43.357
you get that warrant

28:43.358 --> 28:44.757
and you do your job,

28:45.340 --> 28:46.664
whatever the cost.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.124
You going to see Weldon?

29:07.880 --> 29:08.475
Yes.

29:10.471 --> 29:12.367
I'd like to come with you.
I think I can help.

29:13.425 --> 29:14.548
I don't think you can.

29:14.672 --> 29:15.708
Look, I heard what you said.

29:16.305 --> 29:16.997
I did.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.947
And I think I can be
a valuable asset.

29:21.047 --> 29:23.437
I play poker with the guy.
I can tell when he's bluffing.

29:24.347 --> 29:25.835
And what about if I
have to force his hand,

29:25.836 --> 29:26.987
can you be an asset then?

29:29.561 --> 29:30.547
Look, I don't think he did it.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.689
But if he did, I want to know.

29:33.616 --> 29:34.967
That makes me objective.

29:40.905 --> 29:43.953
Sir, you don't have to talk to them.
It's--it's my job.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.807
It's okay, Brian.
I don't need you to protect me.

29:45.855 --> 29:47.533
- Sir--
- I haven't done anything wrong.

29:48.847 --> 29:49.549
Please.

29:50.993 --> 29:51.615
Thank you.

29:52.514 --> 29:53.319
Thank you.

29:57.110 --> 29:58.953
Your honor, I appreciate
you speaking with us.

29:58.954 --> 30:00.906
Well, it sounded like I
didn't have a choice.

30:01.537 --> 30:02.617
Well, the last time we spoke,

30:02.618 --> 30:04.785
you said you that you didn't
know Laura Cambridge.

30:04.786 --> 30:05.501
That's right.

30:05.502 --> 30:08.786
And yet here you are
standing next to Laura--

30:08.787 --> 30:11.682
a volunteer at reading train.

30:13.293 --> 30:14.315
I-I didn't recognize her,

30:14.316 --> 30:16.134
but in context,
I-I remember her.

30:16.135 --> 30:18.207
This event was a few nights ago.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.664
She was trying to
talk to me, but--

30:19.665 --> 30:21.078
Did she talk to you?

30:21.079 --> 30:21.997
No, I got pulled away.

30:21.998 --> 30:23.217
I had donors I had
to speak with.

30:23.218 --> 30:24.924
I remember her saying that
she wanted to talk to me,

30:24.925 --> 30:26.439
but circumstances prevented it.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.448
So you and Laura never
actually spoke?

30:28.449 --> 30:29.986
- No.
- Not even on the phone?

30:29.987 --> 30:31.821
No, honestly, after that night,

30:31.822 --> 30:33.765
I never gave her a
second thought.

30:34.655 --> 30:35.995
You know, in this photo,

30:35.996 --> 30:39.274
you're wearing a light
brown cashmere coat.

30:39.490 --> 30:42.808
We'd like you to turn it over
to CSU for testing.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.779
Respectfully, I'm going
to have to decline.

30:57.524 --> 30:59.443
- Why?
- Robert...

30:59.444 --> 31:01.930
Give her the coat.
It can only be good for you.

31:01.931 --> 31:03.584
I'm afraid I can't do that.

31:03.589 --> 31:04.389
Why?

31:04.390 --> 31:07.356
I had nothing to do with
Laura Cambridge's murder,

31:07.357 --> 31:10.028
or the theft of money
from my charity,

31:10.029 --> 31:11.876
or anything else
I've been accused of

31:11.877 --> 31:13.060
in the last 48 hours.

31:13.061 --> 31:15.164
Do you think that any of
this is a coincidence?

31:15.165 --> 31:16.631
- Robert--
- No, me here, talking to you,

31:16.632 --> 31:18.599
this is exactly what they
wanted to have happen,

31:18.600 --> 31:21.423
so, no, I will not
give you my coat.

31:21.424 --> 31:23.078
Look, there's a
conspiracy against me,

31:23.079 --> 31:25.005
and I will not
voluntarily feed it.

31:25.006 --> 31:26.220
What conspiracy?

31:26.221 --> 31:28.964
Don't you think it's funny
that all this is happening

31:28.965 --> 31:30.981
the moment I consider
running for governor?

31:30.982 --> 31:33.282
Rick, I'm used to
having enemies.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.803
But this is an organized
effort to destroy me.

31:35.804 --> 31:39.392
So right now, I
don't trust anyone.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.365
Well, he has good reason
to not turn over his coat.

31:44.366 --> 31:45.914
Yes, guilt.

31:46.001 --> 31:48.715
A conspiracy.
Is it so far-fetched?

31:48.716 --> 31:50.917
Maybe Laura found out about
it and tried to warn him.

31:50.918 --> 31:52.968
Or maybe she and
Weldon did talk.

31:52.969 --> 31:54.454
She confronted him
with what she knew,

31:54.455 --> 31:55.678
and he killed her.

31:55.679 --> 31:57.833
Mm. I believe the conspiracy.

31:57.834 --> 31:58.873
I mean, I know Weldon.

31:58.874 --> 32:00.928
And Weldon knows you.

32:01.199 --> 32:02.616
Conspiracies, intrigue--

32:02.617 --> 32:04.311
that's your bread and butter.

32:04.312 --> 32:07.333
That's exactly the kind of story
that you would respond to.

32:07.334 --> 32:09.524
I'm sorry. Are--are you
suggesting he's playing me?

32:09.525 --> 32:12.941
I am suggesting that you
consider the possibility.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.037
I have a procedure to follow.

32:15.038 --> 32:17.013
He didn't provide
his coat willingly,

32:17.014 --> 32:18.931
so I'm gonna have to
get a court order.

32:19.724 --> 32:21.889
Look, once word gets
out that the NYPD

32:21.890 --> 32:23.617
subpoenaed his clothing
in connection with

32:23.618 --> 32:25.169
embezzlement and murder,

32:25.170 --> 32:26.638
that man's career will be over.

32:26.639 --> 32:27.426
Not if he's innocent.

32:27.427 --> 32:30.366
Are you kidding me?
Kate, this is politics.

32:30.367 --> 32:31.962
Perception is reality.

32:31.963 --> 32:32.901
The truth won't matter.

32:32.902 --> 32:34.383
What am I supposed to do, Rick?

32:34.384 --> 32:37.393
I can't just stop being a cop
just because it's inconvenient.

32:37.394 --> 32:40.729
No. No, no, no, just...
you can wait.

32:40.730 --> 32:42.422
All right? For something
else, for another lead.

32:42.423 --> 32:43.979
For the coat to disappear?

32:43.980 --> 32:45.736
You don't think I don't
know what's at stake here?

32:45.737 --> 32:47.192
Do you think I actually
want to do this?

32:47.193 --> 32:47.815
Then don't do it.

32:47.816 --> 32:50.030
I don't have a choice.

32:57.448 --> 32:58.985
My office is cooperating

32:58.986 --> 33:01.516
fully with both investigations.

33:01.517 --> 33:03.735
And I stand here
with 100% confidence

33:03.736 --> 33:05.725
that a full and
thorough investigation

33:05.726 --> 33:07.916
will reveal that I am
completely innocent

33:07.917 --> 33:10.349
of any wrongdoing.

33:10.350 --> 33:11.690
You still believe him?

33:12.020 --> 33:13.219
I do.

33:13.726 --> 33:15.442
You've been down
this road before

33:15.443 --> 33:16.465
with a friend.

33:16.466 --> 33:17.785
You believed Damian Westlake.

33:17.786 --> 33:19.365
He's rotting in
prison for murder.

33:19.366 --> 33:21.031
Damian and I were kids together.

33:21.032 --> 33:23.066
Believing in him was sentiment.

33:23.173 --> 33:25.949
My experience tells me,
Weldon is innocent.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.578
My experience tells me,
there's something very wrong

33:27.579 --> 33:28.727
with this whole situation.

33:28.728 --> 33:29.696
In that case,

33:29.697 --> 33:32.051
maybe it's time to
phone a friend.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.587
Right there, Mr. Castle.

33:46.002 --> 33:47.201
That'll be fine.

33:49.977 --> 33:52.015
You know Weldon's
not behind this.

33:52.546 --> 33:54.426
That's why you
offered your help.

33:55.474 --> 33:57.781
He's right about the
conspiracy, isn't he?

33:58.306 --> 33:59.639
He isn't wrong.

34:02.472 --> 34:03.690
So what do I do?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.164
How do I help him?

34:05.481 --> 34:07.004
Listen to the evidence.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.300
That's what Laura did.

34:08.301 --> 34:09.554
No, I-I watched the video

34:09.554 --> 34:11.210
of Laura and the mayor
a hundred times.

34:11.212 --> 34:12.293
There's nothing there.

34:37.369 --> 34:40.154
I met Weldon a few
times before this.

34:40.866 --> 34:42.032
I liked him.

34:44.464 --> 34:46.023
You didn't set his
house on fire.

34:46.024 --> 34:47.152
No.

34:47.987 --> 34:50.134
I just threw gasoline on it.

34:55.745 --> 34:56.721
Beckett.

34:56.722 --> 34:57.268
You need a ride?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.035
But we gotta stop and
pick up my kids.

35:05.572 --> 35:06.566
Thanks for coming.

35:06.567 --> 35:09.808
I wasn't sure that you would,
given the way we left things.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.153
I can't apologize for
doing my job, Castle.

35:16.154 --> 35:17.904
And I would never ask you to.

35:19.048 --> 35:20.488
So why did you call me here?

35:20.489 --> 35:22.829
Because I had an epiphany.

35:22.830 --> 35:25.362
All this time, we've been
looking for evidence...

35:25.363 --> 35:27.820
when we should've been
listening instead.

35:28.316 --> 35:30.558
This all started when
Laura told Edgar Navarro

35:30.559 --> 35:31.541
she heard something on a call,

35:31.542 --> 35:33.359
something she wasn't
supposed to hear.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.823
We writers call this
"The Inciting Incident."

35:35.824 --> 35:38.208
Whoever she spoke to,
whatever she heard,

35:38.209 --> 35:39.516
is what led to her murder.

35:39.517 --> 35:40.657
Well, what does it matter?

35:40.658 --> 35:42.059
I mean, the hard
drive is stolen,

35:42.060 --> 35:43.395
the recording is gone.

35:43.396 --> 35:45.182
We'll never know what
she heard on that call.

35:45.183 --> 35:48.333
No, but we might know
who she heard it from.

35:48.334 --> 35:51.683
You remember...
how Laura fell asleep

35:51.684 --> 35:53.937
- watching those B-roll tapes at Gotham 11?
- Mm-hmm.

35:53.938 --> 35:56.135
She was closing her eyes.

35:56.214 --> 35:58.334
She wasn't watching the tape,
she was listening to them.

35:58.335 --> 36:00.566
So you're saying she was trying
to ID our caller's voice?

36:00.567 --> 36:02.586
I had Sarah, our
goddess dispatcher,

36:02.587 --> 36:04.599
listen to those B-roll tapes.

36:05.445 --> 36:06.500
It's him. I'm sure of it.

36:06.501 --> 36:08.482
He was one of Laura's regulars.

36:08.486 --> 36:09.835
Show her who.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.529
How much more time
can I spend here?

36:13.530 --> 36:14.457
The mayor?

36:14.458 --> 36:15.891
Another 20 minutes,
sir, then we have to

36:15.892 --> 36:17.389
get back to your office
for your meeting with...

36:17.405 --> 36:18.569
That guy.

36:18.972 --> 36:19.855
Jordan Norris--

36:19.856 --> 36:23.129
Deputy Assistant to the
mayor's Chief of Staff.

36:24.196 --> 36:25.618
Mr. Norris, you told us

36:25.619 --> 36:28.713
that you didn't know
Laura Cambridge.

36:28.714 --> 36:29.246
That's right.

36:29.247 --> 36:31.994
And yet your 89-year-old
grandmother,

36:31.995 --> 36:33.604
Greta Markenson did.

36:33.605 --> 36:35.412
According to the
phone sex records,

36:35.413 --> 36:38.401
Laura received numerous
phone calls from her.

36:38.402 --> 36:40.921
Which made poor Greta
look pretty frisky

36:41.070 --> 36:44.649
until we realized, you'd been
house-sitting at her apartment.

36:45.158 --> 36:46.543
I-I may have called

36:46.544 --> 36:48.463
that service from time to time,

36:48.464 --> 36:50.826
but I-I never knew who
I was talking to.

36:50.827 --> 36:51.781
I mean, how would I?

36:51.782 --> 36:52.908
We'll get to that in a minute.

36:52.909 --> 36:55.680
In the meantime, we checked
your phone records,

36:55.681 --> 36:58.670
and you sent this
text to a burner cell

36:58.671 --> 37:00.108
about a month ago.

37:00.147 --> 37:01.511
Now to most people,

37:01.512 --> 37:03.640
that would look like a
series of random numbers.

37:03.641 --> 37:05.062
So we looked into it.

37:05.063 --> 37:07.732
Those are actually numbers
to a bank account

37:07.733 --> 37:10.237
for Mayor Weldon
and his charity.

37:10.238 --> 37:13.101
Numbers that someone
could've used

37:13.102 --> 37:17.079
to make it look like the
mayor was embezzling money.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.470
The man who trusted you,

37:18.471 --> 37:19.998
and you sold him out.

37:20.735 --> 37:22.600
So what did they
give you, Jordan?

37:22.601 --> 37:24.112
What'd they promise you?

37:25.786 --> 37:27.171
I-I thought this was
just about the money.

37:27.172 --> 37:30.130
I-I didn't know.
I didn't know they'd try to destroy him.

37:30.131 --> 37:33.090
And when you found out you'd
betrayed the man you work for,

37:33.091 --> 37:35.363
it ate you up, didn't it?

37:35.378 --> 37:38.370
So much so that one night after
too many shots of Tequila,

37:38.371 --> 37:41.114
you called Laura and you
let it all spill out.

37:41.115 --> 37:42.626
Oh, you didn't mean to,

37:42.983 --> 37:45.463
but she was such
a good listener.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.520
It was anonymous.
I-I was supposed to be safe.

37:47.521 --> 37:49.507
But you weren't, because
she was a writer

37:49.508 --> 37:51.681
and you gave her the
story of her life.

37:51.682 --> 37:54.289
So she tracked you down.
She confronted you.

37:54.290 --> 37:57.795
She was gonna blow the whistle
on you, on your friends.

37:58.037 --> 37:59.668
She had to be stopped.

37:59.669 --> 38:01.213
We talked to your
doorman, Jordan.

38:01.214 --> 38:03.625
We know that she visited
you that night.

38:05.907 --> 38:08.116
Okay. She was there.

38:08.117 --> 38:10.517
But... sh-she left
after 20 minutes.

38:10.518 --> 38:13.421
I... I didn't kill her.

38:13.422 --> 38:14.728
You didn't have to.

38:14.729 --> 38:18.602
All you had to do was call
that same burner phone,

38:18.603 --> 38:20.692
and whoever answered sent a man,

38:20.693 --> 38:23.375
a man without a face,

38:23.376 --> 38:27.231
who choked the life out
of Laura Cambridge.

38:27.291 --> 38:30.035
And then he broke into
her home and her work

38:30.036 --> 38:31.941
and he destroyed all
of the evidence

38:31.942 --> 38:33.526
of everything she knew.

38:33.527 --> 38:35.298
Whose phone was it, Jordan?

38:37.187 --> 38:38.662
You don't understand.

38:38.671 --> 38:40.119
These people...

38:40.255 --> 38:42.715
they're more dangerous
than you know.

38:44.525 --> 38:47.568
You are looking at
20 years in prison.

38:47.569 --> 38:50.087
I am offering you a way out.

38:50.088 --> 38:51.933
Now who did you call?

38:52.170 --> 38:53.828
I want a name.

38:54.062 --> 38:55.725
Who did you call?

38:56.310 --> 38:57.469
I, uh...

38:57.470 --> 38:59.415
A name, Jordan.

39:00.193 --> 39:01.266
O--

39:01.267 --> 39:02.339
Say it.

39:03.666 --> 39:04.826
Okay.

39:09.318 --> 39:11.146
The person that I called w--

39:11.305 --> 39:12.346
If it's all the same to you,

39:12.347 --> 39:15.422
I prefer my client not be
asked any more questions.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.022
Your client?

39:17.023 --> 39:19.053
Mr. Norris, I'm Bill Moss.

39:19.054 --> 39:21.114
From now on, please
don't speak to anybody

39:21.115 --> 39:22.815
outside of my presence.

39:22.816 --> 39:24.253
I've been retained
to represent you.

39:24.254 --> 39:25.475
By who?

39:26.215 --> 39:27.435
We're done here.

39:49.465 --> 39:52.422
It seems our mayor will
live to fight another day.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.257
Justice has prevailed.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.007
Not for Laura Cambridge.

39:56.497 --> 39:59.383
We charged Mr. Norris
with criminal facilitation.

39:59.384 --> 40:00.243
That's something.

40:00.244 --> 40:03.044
Jordan Norris is a pawn.

40:03.236 --> 40:05.905
I want the people
controlling him.

40:05.906 --> 40:08.363
Oh, it's a long game, Kate.

40:09.911 --> 40:11.499
Play it piece by piece.

40:26.734 --> 40:28.723
Then why would you
abandon all your plans?

40:28.724 --> 40:30.010
You've been cleared
of all charges.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.520
You know, for someone who
kills off all his characters,

40:32.521 --> 40:33.338
you have a strange

40:33.339 --> 40:36.071
stubborn streak of
optimism in you, but, no.

40:36.072 --> 40:37.548
I can't run for
governor in two years,

40:37.549 --> 40:39.919
I can't run for
president in six.

40:40.993 --> 40:42.259
That dream...

40:42.662 --> 40:43.915
is done.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.006
There's gotta be something we can do.
You're innocent.

40:47.007 --> 40:48.400
A little too innocent.

40:48.538 --> 40:50.698
There are people out
there-- I realize it now--

40:50.699 --> 40:54.019
people who control what goes
on in this city and beyond.

40:54.695 --> 40:57.575
I wouldn't play ball, so
they took me out the game.

40:57.576 --> 40:58.798
It's been decided.

40:58.799 --> 41:00.630
This is as far as I get.

41:04.826 --> 41:06.188
So what are you gonna do now?

41:06.351 --> 41:07.494
I...

41:08.028 --> 41:11.115
am going to continue being
an outstanding mayor

41:11.116 --> 41:14.000
for the greatest city on earth.

41:30.794 --> 41:33.198
Why did you contact me,
Mr. Castle?

41:33.392 --> 41:34.985
The case is resolved.

41:35.194 --> 41:36.372
Resolved?

41:36.438 --> 41:38.028
How is it resolved?

41:38.757 --> 41:40.674
Someone tried to destroy
this city's mayor,

41:40.675 --> 41:42.128
and I want to know who.

41:42.129 --> 41:44.577
Trust me when I say,
it's not your concern.

41:44.578 --> 41:47.656
It is if it involves Beckett
or her mother's murder.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.547
You're a writer,
finish this sentence.

41:51.848 --> 41:54.123
If Weldon had been
run out of office...

41:54.124 --> 41:56.198
I'd be gone from
the 12th precinct.

41:56.199 --> 41:58.417
And then who'd keep Beckett
from looking into things

41:58.418 --> 41:59.371
she shouldn't?

41:59.372 --> 42:01.404
Who'd keep her out
of harm's way?

42:01.962 --> 42:03.820
So you did this to protect her?

42:04.845 --> 42:05.998
Why?

42:06.827 --> 42:08.869
You play chess, Mr. Castle?

42:09.250 --> 42:11.417
There are times when
a well-placed pawn

42:11.418 --> 42:13.678
is more powerful than a king.

42:19.337 --> 42:20.919
I have your number if
I need to reach you.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.847
You don't reach me, Mr. Castle.

42:23.328 --> 42:24.541
I reach you.
