Receiving GDO transmission,
special code two.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.280
Open the iris.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.800
Please... Help.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.040
He's bleeding internally. I'm gonna have
to open him up. Operating Room one!

00:59.200 --> 01:01.120
Go, go, go!

01:04.640 --> 01:08.480
Tek matte, Bra'tac.
Are you in need of medical assistance?

01:08.640 --> 01:11.240
- The blood is not mine.
- What has transpired?

01:11.440 --> 01:14.240
Chulak was attacked.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.600
By Apophis.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.400
Son of a bitch!

02:29.560 --> 02:31.880
Apophis left Sokar's ship
before it exploded.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.240
Somebody's gotta
teach that guy how to die.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.520
He controls the army of Sokar.
A most powerful force.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.720
- I will return with you at once.
- The fight is over, Teal'c.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.800
The attack was swift.
There was nothing left to do...

02:44.960 --> 02:48.280
..but try to save the life
of young Moac, my newest apprentice.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.760
But attacking Chulak doesn't make sense.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.520
All the Jaffa weren't willing
to oppose the Goa'uld, were they?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.960
- No.
- It's quicker to wipe them all out...

02:57.120 --> 02:59.080
..rather than try to weed out traitors.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.160
(phone rings)

03:02.000 --> 03:04.160
Hammond.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.680
I understand.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.120
Bra'tac, you better get down
to the OR right away.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.240
We've done everything we can.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.720
I have failed you.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.360
No. It is I who have failed you.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.960
You are the bravest Jaffa
I have ever trained.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.200
I'm scared.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.080
Kla mel kalak.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.120
- His body is to be burned.
- I will see to it personally.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.200
I am an old man, Teal'c.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.640
One day I wish to spread Moac's ashes
on the grave of Apophis.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.040
But I do not know if I have
the strength to fight any more.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.680
Many have died, old friend.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.800
But their deaths must not go in vain.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.240
Word of this must spread to all Jaffa.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.960
Yes.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.440
But maybe it is for someone younger
and stronger than I to spread that word.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.440
You are the strongest Jaffa
I have ever known.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.280
In my 1 35 years,...

04:59.440 --> 05:03.240
..l have never seen a Goa'uld turn
on those that carry its kind this way.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.640
He massacred so many that have
worshipped him for so long.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.400
Perhaps he has done this to show the
System Lords how truly powerful he is.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.760
You know well Apophis has weapons
that could have been used from space.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.960
There had to be some other purpose.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.320
His army swept through Chulak as if...

05:21.280 --> 05:24.000
They were searching for something.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.400
The Harsesis.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.720
Apophis fathered a child with Sha're,
the host of his mate Amaunet.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.760
- He hoped to create a host for himself.
- It is forbidden.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.760
The child would have all the knowledge
of the Goa'uld. Amaunet hid the boy.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.800
Of course. The boy would be hunted.
He could be the undoing of the Goa'uld.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.400
But Apophis doesn't know
where Amaunet hid him.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.080
- Which is why they searched Chulak.
- Do you know where this child is?

05:54.240 --> 05:57.720
Uh... All I know is
that it's a place called Kheb.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.160
You have heard of such a place?

06:03.680 --> 06:07.720
It is an ancient legend.
I did not believe it really existed.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.000
- It has to.
- The Goa'uld fear and despise Kheb.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.120
They forbade anyone
from speaking of it long ago.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.320
It is something
my father once spoke of to me.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.240
An old tale about a place
discovered long ago by a few Jaffa,...

06:24.400 --> 06:27.600
..and kept secret from the Goa'uld.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.600
When they could no longer carry
a Prim'ta, they would journey to Kheb.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.400
There, their kalak would learn the path
through the darkness into the next life.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.240
- Kalak. That means "soul", right?
- Yes.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.400
When some of the Goa'uld found out
about Kheb, they made their way there.

06:45.560 --> 06:50.000
They did not return.
It was forbidden to speak of ever again.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.320
My father enjoyed telling me this story.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
"If the Goa'uld are truly
all-powerful gods," he would say,...

06:58.240 --> 07:01.200
.."how is it that they fear anything?"

07:03.520 --> 07:06.160
It sounds like the perfect place
to hide someone.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.840
I don't suppose you happen to know
the Stargate address.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.640
- No.
- All I have is obscure Earth mythology...

07:13.800 --> 07:17.800
..that indicates
Osiris once hid there from Seth.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.320
That story, as told among Jaffa,...

07:20.480 --> 07:24.240
..is that Osiris hid
on one of the planets of the Loc'na Ko.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.080
- What's that?
- A group of planets depleted by mining.

07:28.520 --> 07:33.040
I don't suppose you happen to know
the addresses of any of those planets.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.720
There. Those are
the planets of the Loc'na Ko.

07:43.880 --> 07:48.240
- What's the red one?
- We basically have two reference maps.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.920
Yellow represents the cartouche
that the Goa'uld left on Abydos.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.280
The Ancients' original map
of the Stargates is in red.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.000
You don't recognise this address here?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.640
- No.
- If the legend is true,...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.040
..the Goa'uld
never would have included Kheb.

08:04.200 --> 08:09.240
This is the only planet in the system
the Goa'uld didn't include on their map.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.160
We've found it.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.840
How do we know for sure
that this is Kheb?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.360
I have heard
Kheb is an untouched wilderness...

08:22.520 --> 08:26.680
..with great mountains and a temple
in a valley distant from the Stargate.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.400
If the Goa'uld fear Kheb, that would
explain why they never mined this planet.

08:31.560 --> 08:36.799
If Amaunet thought to hide the Harsesis
on Kheb... Apophis would presume so.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.280
Well, scary stories or not,
Apophis is just nuts enough to go.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.880
- I'd like some backup on this one, sir.
- SG-2 will accompany you.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.120
As will l.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.400
Let's just hope we're first.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.320
- We'll check in every 30 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.080
- Hold the fort, Major.
- Yes, sir.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.480
What you got?

09:18.640 --> 09:21.680
A group of Jaffa
passed through here recently.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.720
- Six.
- Eight.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.880
So...

09:27.920 --> 09:29.840
Not the first.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.960
You have been unusually silent, Bra'tac.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.080
There is not much time left
before I can no longer carry a Prim'ta.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.400
When that time comes,
I will have to decide what to do.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.480
If this truly is Kheb,
that time may be upon us both.

10:01.240 --> 10:05.040
- What is it?
- Six of the Jaffa stopped here.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.760
Two went on ahead.
They returned with another. A woman.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.400
How do you know that?

10:12.560 --> 10:15.640
Here. The third of the prints
are small and light,...

10:15.800 --> 10:18.280
..the shoe, an open-toed sandal
worn by Jaffa women.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.560
When they met up again
there was a struggle.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.720
Then they headed into the forest.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.480
Each print is spread wide.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.520
They were running.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.680
- He's good.
- Extremely.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.240
The woman may be the priestess
entrusted with the child.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.000
- Smell that?
- Yeah.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.680
(O'Neill) Carter?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.920
It's OK, sir. It's just a bird.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.920
No... Look.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.000
This is really weird.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.680
They're burnt to a crisp,
yet nothing around them's been touched.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.400
- As if lightning struck them.
- Or some kind of...

11:54.560 --> 11:58.280
I have never before seen
a weapon that could do such a thing.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.160
Weapon...

12:00.320 --> 12:02.240
(Bra'tac) Over here!

12:13.840 --> 12:16.120
She was shot in the back as she fled.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.240
I counted eight bodies... total.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.160
So, what happened here?

12:22.320 --> 12:26.080
The priestess was being escorted
back to the Stargate by two of the Jaffa.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.320
When they met the others, realising
she was in danger, she attempted to flee.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.600
They chased her and shot her.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.800
Then someone or something
attacked them.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.680
- You can't know that for sure.
- I am quite certain.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.080
- What about the child?
- She carried the child.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.800
- How can you know that?
- Her hands are not bound.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.880
Yes.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.800
And they shot low.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.360
And what happened to the boy?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.760
That I cannot guess.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.840
The priestess died
more than two days ago.

13:06.560 --> 13:11.800
But when his Jaffa did not return the
Harsesis, Apophis should have sent more.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.880
Perhaps many more.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.480
Kheb?

13:24.240 --> 13:26.160
Kheb.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.800
No welcoming party.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.800
Well, someone's
been reading Martha Stewart.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.280
Probably inside.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.120
Daniel?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.840
- Jack?
- What ya doin'?

14:12.880 --> 14:16.560
Something about this place says
we shouldn't rush in waving guns around.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.920
He is right. This is sacred ground.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.360
Ayee...

14:32.680 --> 14:34.920
Wait here.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.480
I have dreamed of finding this place
twice as long as you have been alive.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.640
I will accompany you.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.360
Hey! Whoa!

15:22.160 --> 15:25.120
- Where'd you come from?
- I have been here for some time.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.680
No. You weren't here
when we just came in.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.400
- Here is everywhere you are.
- Excuse me?

15:31.560 --> 15:34.840
Um... Hello. I'm, uh, I'm Daniel Jackson.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.560
This is Jack O'Neill, and this is Bra'tac.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.240
We're peaceful explorers
from a place called Earth.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.520
Do you seek oneness with Desala?

15:43.040 --> 15:47.640
"Desala"... I know that word.
It sounds... tribal. African, maybe.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.240
Desala is everything, everywhere.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.120
Nature. It, uh...

15:53.280 --> 15:55.160
- It means "nature".
- Ah.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.080
Put no barriers
between you and where you are.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.800
Don't look at me.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.680
I believe he wishes us
to take off our boots.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.760
Yeah, look. Uh...

16:13.920 --> 16:17.280
- We've been walkin' a ways today...
- Your journey has only begun.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.920
I just think I'm doin' us all a big favour
by keepin' these babies on.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.920
When the mind is enlightened,
the spirit is freed.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.160
The body matters not.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.920
Whew!

16:41.360 --> 16:45.480
Here's an idea. Why don't we just
ask the man if the boy's here?

17:01.480 --> 17:05.000
We've come looking for a boy... A baby.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.560
Lightning flashes, sparks shower.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.240
In one blink of your eyes,
you have missed seeing.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.599
Lightning, you say?

17:14.760 --> 17:18.960
I only know a snowflake
cannot exist in a storm of fire.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.119
- What?!
- Jack...

17:21.280 --> 17:24.119
No, l... You know me.
I'm a huge fan of subtlety.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.119
- But that's downright encryptic.
- Sorry. Don't, uh, don't worry about him.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.000
The sun is warm, wind is wild,
grass is green along the shores.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.720
- Here no bull can hide.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.440
Jack, he's speaking in Zen koans.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.640
Whatever theology he follows may be
an original basis for Buddhism on Earth.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.640
Well, that's very nice. I'll be sure
to call the Dalai Lama when I get home.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.280
But, for now,
how about why we came here?

17:51.920 --> 17:55.560
Um, he's right. This is very important.
Is there a child here?

17:55.720 --> 17:58.360
- There is a child in all of us.
- Oh, come on.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.640
He seeks a real human boy.
Of flesh and bones.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.240
Those who seek oneness
find all that they seek.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
I think this is gonna take a while.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.560
Really? What gives you that idea?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.880
(gust of wind)

18:30.440 --> 18:32.160
Everything OK?

18:34.920 --> 18:37.360
It is nothing.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.680
I do not have
a good feeling about this place.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.880
- What of the Harsesis child, O'Neill?
- I don't know.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.840
There's a monk guy
Daniel thinks might know something,...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.960
..so he's gonna play along for a while.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.040
"Play along"?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.040
Something about... enlightenment?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.600
- Sir...
- I know.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.680
I know.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.800
Within you is a being
whose heart knows only darkness.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.880
- Yes.
- You must renounce such evil...

19:30.040 --> 19:33.000
..to achieve oneness with Oma Desala.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.440
"Oma" - what does that mean?

19:35.600 --> 19:37.920
Words cannot express things.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.320
Speech cannot convey the spirit.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.160
Swayed by words, one is lost. One
cannot carry darkness on the great path.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.760
If I removed the symbiote in me,
I would die.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.320
You cannot start the journey
with it inside you.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.240
So a Jaffa cannot seek oneness
before he is willing to die?

19:58.080 --> 20:01.920
When the mind is freed,
the body is no longer required.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.680
I sense you are not ready
to meet Oma Desala.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.720
I am not ready to die.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.560
But I take solace in the fact
that journey is ahead of me.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.800
So...

20:26.960 --> 20:29.160
I don't, uh, I don't have to die, right?

20:29.320 --> 20:32.880
- You do not have the same evil in you.
- Good.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.480
But you have your own burdens
of which to rid yourself.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.280
OK.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
I am not yet ready to give up.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.760
I feel alive, Teal'c.
Like a young man... of 80.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.760
We still have false gods to slay.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.720
She goes into the lake
without making a ripple.

21:12.880 --> 21:17.560
She goes into the forest
without disturbing a blade of grass.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.640
Who is she?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.920
The mother.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.280
Desala.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.840
Nature. Mother Nature.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.920
We're... We're...
We're talking about Mother Nature.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.880
Why do you seek this child
of flesh and bones?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.120
He is the son of my wife.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.320
- But not your son?
- No.

21:54.920 --> 21:58.640
But my wife is dead now, and I promised
I would make sure the boy is safe.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.120
And you are sure
he will be safe with you?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.280
Yes. Absolutely.

22:03.440 --> 22:07.240
Because it is so clear,
it takes a longer time to realise it.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.440
If you immediately know
the candlelight is fire,...

22:10.600 --> 22:13.640
..then the meal was cooked
a long time ago.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.320
Right.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.040
Um... I, uh...

22:20.880 --> 22:23.320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.920
I can't do it.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.520
You say you seek this child
to fulfil a promise.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.840
- Yes.
- Is there another reason?

22:50.040 --> 22:53.920
The child has knowledge. He can help
my people defend themselves...

22:54.080 --> 22:56.240
..against an evil enemy, the Goa'uld.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.360
You hate the Goa'uld.

22:59.520 --> 23:03.160
The Goa'uld are responsible
for the death of my wife,...

23:04.160 --> 23:06.760
..among millions
and millions of other people.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.120
How can I not hate them?

23:09.280 --> 23:12.920
- Your hate will lead to the child's death.
- How do you know that?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.920
You must trust.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.160
You must believe.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.440
Well, maybe I don't believe
I can light a candle with my mind.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.520
I find it a lot easier to use a lighter
or a match. It's much more practic...

23:35.040 --> 23:37.960
- Wow.
- Now you blow it out.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.120
- With your mind.
- Oh.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.000
I'm sorry. Could you, uh...
Could you light that again?

23:54.760 --> 23:57.080
This isn't a trick candle or anything, is it?

23:57.240 --> 23:59.840
- Put your hand in the flame.
- What?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.840
Place your hand in the flame.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
Agh!

24:22.600 --> 24:24.360
- Why tell me to do that?
- Why do it?

24:24.520 --> 24:27.080
- Because you told me to.
- Because you trusted.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.280
- Yes.
- Within you is the capacity for trust.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.320
Trust Oma Desala.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.160
Do not believe you can light the candle.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.720
Believe she can light the candle.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.960
Time's up.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.800
Jack, the markings on the wall
are a language. It's a bible.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.880
No, more of an instruction book on how
to reach this ethereal plane of existence.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.720
Naturally the Jaffa would interpret it
as a passage to the afterlife.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.280
Whoa! Slow down there, Grasshopper.

25:16.760 --> 25:20.680
OK. I'm pretty sure this place
was built by an alien race millennia ago.

25:20.840 --> 25:25.720
They may have even visited Earth and
inspired the concept of Mother Nature.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.480
So this guy's an alien?

25:28.640 --> 25:33.200
No. The aliens discovered a means to
ascend to a higher plane of existence...

25:33.360 --> 25:36.120
..and went there, wherever "there" is.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.680
They left the writings as a map
for others who wanted to follow them.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.080
The monk is just someone who's
sort of taken up a curatorship.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.760
- A janitor?
- A guide.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.680
- An usher?
- It doesn't matter. Just... watch.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.480
Am I supposed to believe you did that?

26:08.640 --> 26:10.560
Yes.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.240
Daniel...

26:19.240 --> 26:21.160
A word?

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
We didn't come to learn parlour tricks.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.280
- Is the boy here or not?
- I think so.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.960
Because every minute we stay here,
we're risking our necks.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.360
I'm on the verge of ordering
a complete search of this place.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.440
- You can't do that.
- You're confused, Daniel. I can.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.280
- I am gaining his trust.
- How long is that gonna take?

26:44.440 --> 26:47.160
- Jack, you don't understand.
- I think I do.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.680
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.320
All right, that's dangerous. Put it down.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.600
OK. That was a little more impressive.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.240
- How'd you do that?
- Actually, I did that.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.800
- What?
- That's what I've been tryin' to tell you.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.280
This is incredible.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.480
- He taught you...
- How to do things with my mind.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.560
You could do it, too.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.280
He could teach me how to light candles
and move stuff around by thinking?

27:32.440 --> 27:35.600
I cannot teach you
what you already know.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.240
Oh, I don't think I know
as much as you think I know.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.520
You must come to know Oma Desala.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.480
- Become her friend.
- (whoosh)

27:50.000 --> 27:51.920
That your friend?

28:02.800 --> 28:04.680
Oh, great(!)

28:04.840 --> 28:07.560
Teal'c, Bra'tac,
you wanna check that out?

28:10.320 --> 28:14.680
- Major Coburn? This is O'Neill.
- Read you, sir.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.280
We've got Jaffa activity.
How's your position?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.360
- Clear, sir.
- Good. Stand by.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.080
I want claymores
from the entrance to here.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.480
- I thought we were leaving.
- Me, too.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
- So, is the kid here or not?
- Jack...

28:34.160 --> 28:37.120
Daniel! That was a glider.
We're out of time.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.080
- Time means nothing to the...
- Uh-uh!

28:40.520 --> 28:43.000
Don't say it.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.480
(voices from below)

29:02.800 --> 29:04.960
- The claymores are set, sir.
- Good.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.080
- Daniel thinks we should stay.
- Why?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.440
Well, watch.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.840
What?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.680
- You did that?
- Yes.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.120
- That's impossible.
- You'd think.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.840
- Why?
- You learned the power to control fire?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.400
It's not just fire.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.640
All the instructions are here, on the walls.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.760
All you have to do
is be willing to learn and believe.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.520
I'm sorry, but something else
has to be going on here.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.400
Why?

30:02.040 --> 30:05.400
Well... I don't know,
but under different circumstances...

30:05.560 --> 30:09.440
..l would bring in equipment and
check for concealed technology before l...

30:09.600 --> 30:14.400
Doesn't a part of you want to believe
a person can reach a higher level?

30:14.560 --> 30:16.480
- Yes, of course, but...
- Don't you see?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.480
- I have that power.
- To do what?

30:21.880 --> 30:25.520
To protect the child. I think
she doesn't want me to leave...

30:25.680 --> 30:28.720
..until she knows
I understand how to protect him.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.160
Who's "she"?

30:31.320 --> 30:35.120
A Goa'uld mother ship has landed.
As many as 2,000 troops approach.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.200
Love to stay and chat...

30:37.360 --> 30:39.440
Wait! Wait a minute! What about...

31:14.160 --> 31:16.120
Down.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.200
(baby gurgles)

32:23.480 --> 32:25.640
We must elude them through the forest.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.720
Where's Daniel?

32:29.400 --> 32:32.120
Daniel? Daniel, we gotta go!

32:36.400 --> 32:38.320
For cryin' out loud...

32:40.440 --> 32:43.200
- I don't know where he is.
- So what do we do?

32:44.720 --> 32:47.640
- Coburn? O'Neill.
- Read you, sir.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.800
Hightail it back through the gate.
Tell Hammond we're pinned down.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.880
- Request backup.
- Yes, sir.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.960
Lots of backup.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.200
Damn! All right, here they come.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.880
Defensive positions. Hold off
on the claymores as long as we can.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.760
I don't want to get into this
unless we have to.

33:17.920 --> 33:22.480
And if we make it out of this in one piece,
remind me to harm Daniel severely.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.520
Thank you.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.239
He'll be safe with me.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.000
I didn't do any of it, did l?

34:33.880 --> 34:36.360
It was you.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.719
I was wrong. I don't...
I don't have any powers at all.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.920
You do.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.760
You were showing them to me.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.080
That's how you communicate with us.

34:52.199 --> 34:56.360
You were tryin' to tell me the boy
is better off here with you, and l...

34:57.240 --> 34:59.160
I wasn't listening.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.840
I made a promise.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.240
I promised he would be safe.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.840
Kree shak!

35:50.400 --> 35:52.760
Lo koma. Assak!

35:53.600 --> 35:56.200
Joma, sakoon.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.840
(primes weapon)

36:09.600 --> 36:12.800
- You are not welcome here.
- In the name of the god Apophis,...

36:12.960 --> 36:14.880
..we have come for a young boy.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.240
- You will leave now.
- We will not.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.080
Stand aside.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.080
(Daniel) No!

36:35.240 --> 36:37.280
Drop your weapons!

36:40.080 --> 36:42.520
- Do it!
- Kree, lo assak.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.520
- Drop your weapons.
- You heard him!

36:45.760 --> 36:49.040
- I was talking to you, Jack.
- Wh... What?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.760
- Do it now, all of you.
- Daniel?

36:59.920 --> 37:04.320
Jack, I was wrong. I was very wrong.
One of those aliens is still here.

37:07.680 --> 37:11.720
- Sir, we put our guns down, we're dead.
- You will die if you do not.

37:11.880 --> 37:15.760
Jack, if you're ever gonna trust me
on anything, now is the time.

37:16.640 --> 37:21.080
The alien is the one with the powers,
and she is not someone to fool with.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.880
(whispers) You must do it!

37:50.680 --> 37:52.600
Kill them.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.800
Bye.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.760
(screaming)

38:27.840 --> 38:29.760
Well, that was cool.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.040
Wow!

39:14.280 --> 39:16.200
You're leaving.

39:21.640 --> 39:25.880
You know that more of them will come
as long as they know the boy is here.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.680
I'll see both of you again someday, right?

39:54.400 --> 39:57.520
I take it that was
the Harsesis child she was holding.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.680
Yeah.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.320
I thought we needed that kid.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.200
You're just gonna let her...?

40:06.720 --> 40:08.920
No choice, huh?

40:10.160 --> 40:12.600
Colonel O'Neill, Major Coburn. Come in.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.800
- Yeah, go ahead, Major.
- Reinforcements are on the way, sir.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.960
Take your time. We're secure.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.200
Good to hear it, sir.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.080
Uh, sir, the Stargate just came on.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.560
There's a strange bright light
headed this way.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.240
Do not engage. Repeat:
get out of the way and do not engage.

40:33.400 --> 40:38.320
In fact, I'm ordering you all to put down
your weapons until that light is gone.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.040
Yes, sir.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.960
(Major Coburn) It's gone, sir.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.600
- You all right?
- Yeah.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.280
Let's go home.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.040
Daniel? Shoes.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.600
