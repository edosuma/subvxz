00:02.077 --> 00:03.662
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:03.746 --> 00:06.123
Did you take something
that doesn't belong to you?

00:06.207 --> 00:07.541
- I want in.
- That's him.

00:07.625 --> 00:08.834
Shit.

00:09.752 --> 00:11.962
Hey, what the hell, you can't do that.

00:12.046 --> 00:15.341
I did this for your own good, Nancy.

00:15.424 --> 00:18.010
- They want to send me to Iraq, Lupita.
- Bye.

00:18.093 --> 00:22.097
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:22.181 --> 00:23.974
I need someone I trust
to handle my money.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.601
- What money?
- For my commercials.

00:25.684 --> 00:27.019
I'm the new Huskeroos girl.

00:27.102 --> 00:28.812
- You were traded.
- I was what?

00:28.896 --> 00:32.316
Now, I bought your chit,
you're about to grow me some shit.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.694
The way I see it,
you still owe me 150 G's, lady!

00:56.423 --> 01:00.010
<i># La colina tapizada</i>

01:00.094 --> 01:02.846
<i># Con cajas, todas son igual</i>

01:02.930 --> 01:08.269
<i># Reja blanca y un tapete
que te invita a pasar</i>

01:08.352 --> 01:10.854
<i># Una verde, otra amarilla</i>

01:10.938 --> 01:13.440
<i># Yotra que est√°n a punto de pintar</i>

01:13.524 --> 01:19.029
<i># Pero todas tienen algo

01:19.113 --> 01:21.824
<i># Yla gente de las casas</i>

01:21.907 --> 01:24.618
<i># Todos van a la universidad</i>

01:24.702 --> 01:29.874
<i># Para convertirse en alguien

01:29.957 --> 01:35.421

abogados, listos a pelear</i>

<i># Licenciados con su traje,

01:59.236 --> 02:01.155
How long have I been asleep?

02:01.238 --> 02:02.865
- Not long.
- 22 hours.

02:02.948 --> 02:06.035
- Shane.
- What, like she wouldn't figure it out?

02:06.118 --> 02:07.870
This is absolutely delicious.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.538
- I make this.
- Lupita, you're fired.

02:10.622 --> 02:12.541
What? But I cooked!

02:12.625 --> 02:14.501
I can't afford to pay you any more.

02:14.585 --> 02:16.629
What if I tell the police what you do?

02:16.712 --> 02:20.799
Then the guy I owe money to
might decide to kill you.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.719
Erm, maybe we should not discuss this

02:23.802 --> 02:25.846
in front of the younger members
of our audience.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.932
I'm not keeping any secrets any more.

02:28.015 --> 02:32.811
The kids need to know what's going on
so they can be aware if there's danger.

02:32.895 --> 02:34.396
What kind of danger?

02:34.480 --> 02:37.191
Big, scary men with guns
who want a lot of money from Mommy,

02:37.274 --> 02:39.485
so let's just be alert

02:39.568 --> 02:43.155
and talk about how much money
we can all raise now.

02:43.656 --> 02:45.991
Andy, speak to me.

02:46.075 --> 02:48.744
If you stake me the ten-grand buy-in,

02:48.827 --> 02:51.830
there's a World Poker Classic
at Commerce this week.

02:56.794 --> 02:59.880
- Silas, what you got?
- I can crack safes.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.552
Too soon, my son. Too soon. Shane.

03:04.635 --> 03:08.389
I have a stock portfolio worth $2600.

03:08.472 --> 03:11.308
- Cash it in.
- But if I liquidate now, I pay a penalty.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.686
Shane, now.

03:19.108 --> 03:20.985
The three of you keep thinking.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.029
Now, there's not much here
in the way of assets,

03:24.113 --> 03:27.491
but you do have Isabelle
and her Huskeroos contract.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.994
Now, that is a cash cow right there.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.579
You got the cow part right.

03:31.662 --> 03:35.207
Hey, that is no way to talk
about your greatest asset.

03:35.291 --> 03:39.086
If you have a lousy relationship
with your income-generating child,

03:39.169 --> 03:41.380
you need to turn that around right now.

03:41.463 --> 03:44.341
Spend some time with her. Charm her.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.343
You want sole custody.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.804
- I do?
- You do.

03:48.888 --> 03:51.891
You're not the one that cupped her
pubescent breasts

03:51.974 --> 03:54.018
after a few too many chardonnays.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.728
What?

03:57.646 --> 04:00.524
- Never.
- Well, just thought I'd float it out there,

04:00.608 --> 04:02.026
see if it caught wind.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.654
Doesn't matter. We'll get him.
Allow me to illustrate.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.532
This is your husband.

04:09.742 --> 04:13.787
Watch how he struggles
for the slightest hint of sustenance,

04:15.122 --> 04:18.875
slouching toward a Bethlehem of mercy
that never appears.

04:18.959 --> 04:23.839
And just when he's about to resign himself
to his miserable, doomed fate,

04:23.923 --> 04:27.343
we allow the son of a bitch
to escape with his life.

04:27.426 --> 04:29.762
Over here, you little fucker.

04:31.555 --> 04:36.644
In the end, he'll thank us for not crushing
his sad, little testicles in a vice.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.230
Do fish have testicles?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.232
Fish have internal testicles.

04:43.192 --> 04:45.778
Only real downer, besides the residual pain,

04:45.861 --> 04:47.655
is the issue of warm-weather footwear.

04:47.738 --> 04:50.950
I sport the flip-flop, the summer sandal,

04:51.033 --> 04:54.119
I get stares. Children cry and run away.

04:54.203 --> 04:57.122
- Can we go to the arcade now?
- Well, Mr Botwin...

04:57.206 --> 05:00.209
when injuries such as yours may have
rendered you unfit for duty in the past,

05:00.292 --> 05:03.087
- I'm afraid times have changed.
- Hmm? What do you mean?

05:03.170 --> 05:07.883
In case you haven't read a newspaper in
four years, this country, your country, is at war.

05:07.967 --> 05:12.096
Actually, technically,
Operation "Iraqi Freedom"

05:12.179 --> 05:15.057
is an extended military engagement.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.809
War has not been declared.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.936
Actually, technically,

05:19.019 --> 05:22.481
authorisation for the use of military force
has been given by Congress.

05:22.565 --> 05:25.359
That's enough to activate
your uncle here into service.

05:25.442 --> 05:27.111
Yeah, I'm clearly not fit.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.904
- You can walk, can't you?
- Not in lockstep, no.

05:28.988 --> 05:30.698
- I tend to weave now.
- Didn't notice.

05:30.781 --> 05:32.616
- I'll fail the drug test.
- We'll clean you up.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.160
- I'm gay.
- We got a unit for that.

05:35.244 --> 05:38.205
Look, son, truth is,
you're never gonna see combat.

05:38.289 --> 05:40.833
- We want to win this war.
- It's not a war.

05:40.916 --> 05:45.129
My point is, you're headed
for a desk job, son.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.924
So quit your whining and prepare to serve,
cos we got you and we're not gonna let you go.

05:49.008 --> 05:52.094
Now, you report back here
at 0500 tomorrow morning

05:52.177 --> 05:53.846
with these papers properly filled out.

05:53.929 --> 05:56.557
You must bring with you
a social security card,

05:56.640 --> 05:58.684
a birth certificate, and a driver's licence.

05:58.767 --> 06:04.523
Do not bring iPods, watches, jewellery,
excessive cash, or any other valuables.

06:04.607 --> 06:06.317
This is bullshit.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.028
Welcome to the army, soldier.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.324
All the MILF weed's destroyed?

06:13.407 --> 06:16.035
- There's nothing.
- I was gonna buy a boat.

06:16.118 --> 06:18.913
Doug, can we just focus on me
for a second, please?

06:18.996 --> 06:20.915
- I'm in serious trouble.
- All right.

06:20.998 --> 06:24.293
Lots of cash, real quick, no boat.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.920
OK.

06:27.963 --> 06:30.674
- Why aren't you dressed?
- Dana threw me out of the house.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.718
I've been sleeping here in the office.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.386
- She threw you out?
- Yeah.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.347
She found out that I was fucking Celia.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.600
Celia? Jesus!

06:39.683 --> 06:41.310
I'm repulsed.

06:42.394 --> 06:43.646
Fascinated.

06:43.729 --> 06:46.649
I need to hear about this.
Not now, definitely later.

06:46.732 --> 06:48.150
Now we need to focus.

06:48.234 --> 06:51.737
How much could I raise
if I liquidated all my stocks and bonds?

06:51.820 --> 06:53.906
- You don't have stocks and bonds.
- Yes, I do.

06:53.989 --> 06:56.825
I have stocks and bonds.
Judah left me stocks and bonds.

06:56.909 --> 07:01.121
He did, but then you had me sell everything
so you could start up the bakery.

07:01.205 --> 07:03.499
- Everything?
- There wasn't much.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.000
Judah was lousy at playing the market.

07:05.084 --> 07:07.836
I mean, a company that sells
morning-after pills for dogs?

07:07.920 --> 07:11.632
- You were the one advising him, Doug.
- OK, that one did not come from me.

07:11.715 --> 07:13.425
Clear dentures. Yeah, me.

07:13.509 --> 07:16.053
But he went rogue on ARF-U 486.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.974
- Anyway, you're broke again.
- No, Doug, unacceptable.

07:20.057 --> 07:23.227
There has to be something.
There's always something.

07:23.310 --> 07:27.356
How much money could I get
if I sold my house?

07:27.439 --> 07:29.817
Not much.
The bubble's bursting in Agrestic.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.362
Majestic next door, that's the new hot spot,
with their chartered schools and mega-church.

07:33.445 --> 07:36.198
- It's crucifying our property values.
- How much, Doug?

07:36.282 --> 07:40.536
If you even found a buyer,
you can net maybe 50 grand.

07:40.619 --> 07:43.622
But then any place you'd rent would be
more than the mortgage you're paying now.

07:43.706 --> 07:46.333
- It's not smart.
- It's cash in hand. Let's do it.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.627
- Where will you live?
- I can only deal with one thing at a time.

07:48.711 --> 07:51.964
If I deal with one thing at a time,
I'm less inclined to shoot myself in the head.

07:52.047 --> 07:55.968
Oh, don't do that. Your life insurance
ran out a few weeks ago.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.054
I sent you an e-mail.

07:59.138 --> 08:02.683
Get it back, Doug.
My kids may seriously need it soon.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.144
I gotta go.

08:06.270 --> 08:09.064
- Celia.
- The cock wants what it wants.

08:10.024 --> 08:13.444
5,000 square feet of raw space
at 250 a foot is a good price.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.404
Mm-hm.

08:15.487 --> 08:18.449
I could retrofit the climate control,
put three or four generators in,

08:18.532 --> 08:20.159
wouldn't have to worry about the sound.

08:20.242 --> 08:24.371
Put the cover business up front
for appearances. Secure the back for crops.

08:24.455 --> 08:25.623
Mm-hm.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.458
Downtown is supposed to be
blowing up right now.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.585
The lady said they're building
a Whole Foods just up the block,

08:29.668 --> 08:31.712
so you can get all that
good gourmet shit you like.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.840
Boy, looky here. How you like that view?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.761
He gonna kill those nice plants.

08:39.845 --> 08:42.264
Why you start smoking again?

08:42.347 --> 08:45.017
I ain't seen you smoke
since back when I was in junior high.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.437
And, God damn. Mores, no less.

08:48.520 --> 08:54.026
I started smoking, I was long and brown,
like these cigarettes.

08:54.109 --> 08:56.278
Everything has changed.

08:56.362 --> 09:00.241
You don't like it, come on.
Let's tell her we're gonna keep looking.

09:00.324 --> 09:02.493
Can you grow here?

09:04.954 --> 09:07.665
Hell, yeah. It's perfect.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.334
Fucking shame it's all gonna be for U-Turn.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.379
You let me worry about U-Turn.

09:14.463 --> 09:16.090
Just grow.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.385
How we doing out here?

09:19.468 --> 09:21.637
We'll take it.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.931
That toilet paper is like wiping yourself

09:24.014 --> 09:28.727
- with a brown paper bag.
- Are your... parts OK?

09:28.811 --> 09:30.479
My parts are fine.

09:30.563 --> 09:33.274
Can I go home now? This place is a pit.

09:33.357 --> 09:37.069
No, it's not. It's... kitschy.

09:37.152 --> 09:39.196
Like we're in film noir.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.657
It's a walk on the wild side.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.367
Didn't you like getting manicures?

09:43.450 --> 09:46.620
- You wouldn't let me get the colour I wanted.
- Black is not a colour.

09:46.704 --> 09:49.123
- Tell that to black people.
- I don't know any.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.835
Maybe there's something
good on television.

09:57.882 --> 10:02.261
<i>Over two sizzling hours
of hot, young girl-on-girl action.</i>

10:02.344 --> 10:05.973
- Sweet.
- No. No, you're not watching that.

10:07.850 --> 10:11.437
- Might as well just go to bed.
- Fine.

10:12.438 --> 10:15.524
- Here.
- How come I have to sleep on the cot?

10:15.608 --> 10:18.485
Because I'm the mother,
and you're the child.

10:19.236 --> 10:22.740
Unless you wanted to share the bed.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.409
We haven't done that since you were four.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.370
- How fun!
- Yeah, well, I'm not four.

10:28.454 --> 10:31.123
And I don't have any desire
to share a bed with my mother.

10:31.207 --> 10:33.083
Why am I even here?

10:33.167 --> 10:36.795
- Because we're spending time together.
- But we don't like each other.

10:36.879 --> 10:39.173
Maybe we just don't know
each other very well.

10:39.256 --> 10:43.469
No, this is a chance for us
to improve our relationship.

10:43.552 --> 10:47.223
- Mm.
- I'll get in my bed. You get in your bed.

10:47.306 --> 10:51.852
We'll shut off the lights,
and we will really talk, OK?

10:54.188 --> 10:56.273
That's a condom.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.946
Pearl inlay on the fret boards.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.782
That's handmade. It's a '56 Les Paul.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.368
Should bring in about 3,000 bucks on eBay.

11:07.451 --> 11:09.787
- You should have kept running.
- Hey, let's keep hope alive.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.748
I'm only going to be three hours away.
It's on American soil.

11:12.831 --> 11:14.667
I can come visit every weekend,

11:14.750 --> 11:18.379
and you can hang out in my room
whenever you feel sad.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.382
Don't open the nightstand drawer.

11:21.465 --> 11:23.551
Actually, your room isn't gonna be here.

11:24.385 --> 11:26.804
I decided to put the house up for sale.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.890
It's a good time to rent,
with the market and all.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.394
We all need to embrace change.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.730
Yeah.

11:36.814 --> 11:39.441
Hey, good luck in court today, champ.

12:01.463 --> 12:04.884
Fingers crossed for a female judge.
Cry if you can.

12:06.886 --> 12:09.054
I'll keep that in mind.

12:15.686 --> 12:17.980
It's good to embrace change, right?

12:30.492 --> 12:31.869
Marvin.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.165
Lady brings me seven grand.

12:36.999 --> 12:41.253
- What I do with seven grand?
- You wipe your ass with seven grand.

12:41.337 --> 12:42.838
This is bullshit.

12:42.922 --> 12:45.591
Marvin, go pick up one of her kids
and break his leg.

12:45.674 --> 12:47.134
It's all I've got.

12:47.218 --> 12:49.887
I'm waiting on some PayPal payments.

12:49.970 --> 12:53.807
I promise I'll have more for you
to wipe your ass with soon.

12:53.891 --> 12:56.268
You gonna work this off in trade.

12:56.352 --> 12:57.811
What kind of trade?

12:57.895 --> 13:01.857
White slave trade.

13:03.734 --> 13:05.152
Here.

13:08.739 --> 13:10.074
Go there.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.452
Tell them I sent you.
They gonna give you a package.

13:13.536 --> 13:16.622
- Bring that package back to me.
- A package of what?

13:16.705 --> 13:19.083
A package of whatever the fuck
I tell you to pick up, bitch!

13:19.166 --> 13:21.877
OK, you don't have to yell at me.

13:21.961 --> 13:24.255
- When do you need it?
- Right now.

13:24.338 --> 13:26.757
My son's being sentenced today.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.009
That's just sad.

13:29.093 --> 13:32.805
You know, you should really get him
in one of those after-school programmes

13:32.888 --> 13:35.432
instead of letting him run all wild and shit.

13:35.516 --> 13:39.061
- I'm really glad you understand.
- I don't understand shit.

13:39.144 --> 13:41.313
Move some stuff around.

13:41.397 --> 13:43.357
I'll do my best.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.698
- Why did you send her?
- I wanted to see how she'd do.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.502
Please talk to me.

14:06.005 --> 14:08.465
Listen, I am really trying here.

14:12.428 --> 14:14.597
Just sitting there like some little shitball.

14:18.976 --> 14:21.437
- Can I help you?
- My name is Miriam Walters.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.648
I'm an officer with the State of California
Child Protective Services.

14:24.732 --> 14:26.901
Are you Ms Celia "Hod-es"?

14:28.068 --> 14:30.154
It's pronounced "Hodes".

14:30.237 --> 14:33.449
May we have your permission
to enter the premises?

14:33.532 --> 14:35.409
- What for?
- I must warn you

14:35.492 --> 14:37.536
that if you do not allow me
entry into the premises,

14:37.620 --> 14:39.580
I will return with a court order.

14:39.663 --> 14:42.708
If you still refuse me entry,
you may be subject to prosecution

14:42.791 --> 14:44.084
under California state law, which...

14:44.168 --> 14:47.171
All right, obviously, there's some mistake.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.007
No, there isn't. I called them.

14:52.843 --> 14:56.055
Ah, you little jokester, you.

14:56.138 --> 14:59.725
I must ask you once more, Ms "Hod-es",
do I have permission to enter the premises?

14:59.808 --> 15:01.769
Sure. Enter away.

15:02.853 --> 15:04.647
I have nothing to hide.

15:08.484 --> 15:10.152
What are you writing?

15:10.236 --> 15:13.113
I'm here to determine whether
this is an unsuitable environment

15:13.197 --> 15:15.241
in which to house a child.

15:15.324 --> 15:17.868
There was a used condom in my bed.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.578
That was not a condom.

15:19.662 --> 15:22.039
- Then what was it?
- A plastic wrapper.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.416
With a reservoir tip?

15:25.167 --> 15:27.545
Just because this establishment

15:27.628 --> 15:31.924
may be on the lower end
of the economic scale

15:32.007 --> 15:35.052
does not mean that it's unsuitable.

15:35.135 --> 15:38.681
If you are suggesting that
anything less than affluence

15:38.764 --> 15:43.102
is somehow untoward, Ms Walters,

15:43.185 --> 15:45.938
well, I think that I need to...

15:46.021 --> 15:49.024
Oh, yeah! Oh!

15:49.108 --> 15:50.359
Fuck me harder!

15:50.442 --> 15:52.111
...speak to your supervisor.
- Yeah. Come on, babe.

15:52.194 --> 15:54.864
Fuck me harder! Fuck me harder!

15:54.947 --> 15:56.991
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Fuck me harder!

15:57.074 --> 15:58.284
- Harder!
- Yeah!

15:58.367 --> 16:00.369
- Harder! Harder!
- Yeah!

16:14.925 --> 16:16.510
Hola.

16:22.558 --> 16:24.018
U- Turn sent me.

16:24.101 --> 16:26.312
I'm supposed to pick up a package.

16:29.315 --> 16:31.233
U- Turn...

16:31.317 --> 16:34.778
Para obtengo el paqueto.

16:37.281 --> 16:40.826
<i>- Any chance you speak French?
- Ven aqu√≠.</i>

16:54.006 --> 16:55.633
You say U-Turn sends you?

16:55.716 --> 16:58.844
Yeah, U- Turn. He sent me.
I'm supposed to pick up a package.

17:04.474 --> 17:07.019
Will you please tell him to open the door?

17:07.102 --> 17:10.021
What's the matter,
you don't speak Spanish?

17:10.105 --> 17:11.522
No, I don't.

17:11.607 --> 17:15.152
How can you live in Los Angeles
and not know Spanish?

17:15.236 --> 17:17.905
We're almost half the population here.

17:17.988 --> 17:20.699
Por ejemplo, if I told you...

17:20.782 --> 17:24.078
conozco a este hombre que se llama U-Turn...

17:24.161 --> 17:26.664
would you not like that?

17:26.747 --> 17:29.708
Erm, well, that depends.
What does it mean?

17:29.792 --> 17:33.671
It means that maybe I do know this man
who calls himself U-Turn.

17:34.296 --> 17:36.632
Then maybe you also have
a package for me.

17:36.715 --> 17:38.425
Maybe I do.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.428
- Ta-da!
- Oh...

17:41.512 --> 17:43.055
Er...

17:43.138 --> 17:44.890
I have to be in court right now,

17:44.974 --> 17:47.685
so let's just pretend that I reached
for it another few times,

17:47.768 --> 17:50.229
and each time, you grabbed it away. So...

17:50.312 --> 17:52.356
where does that leave us?

17:52.439 --> 17:54.984
You ever get something
for nothing in your life?

17:56.402 --> 17:58.237
I don't think so.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.949
And it ain't gonna happen
for the first time here.

18:07.663 --> 18:09.081
What do you want?

18:09.164 --> 18:11.584
I want you to do the brick dance for me.

18:12.418 --> 18:13.836
A brick dance?

18:13.919 --> 18:18.549
You must dance to the great god of mota!

18:18.632 --> 18:22.553
And if you do it right,
then you get your brick.

18:24.179 --> 18:25.848
And if I refuse?

18:25.931 --> 18:28.058
No baila, no brick.

18:41.989 --> 18:44.200
This is not a real brick dance.

18:44.283 --> 18:46.994
Man, that's a shot-of-cheap-tequila dance.

18:47.745 --> 18:50.122
Now show me a real brick dance.

18:59.131 --> 19:03.344
You know what?
That's a loose-joint dance, at best.

19:03.427 --> 19:06.430
You know what?
I been way too sweet with you.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.600
If you will not do a real brick dance for me,

19:09.683 --> 19:12.895
then I cannot give you the brick.

19:12.978 --> 19:14.480
Mm-mm, won't happen.

19:19.401 --> 19:22.029
Er, hold your horses, Pedro.

19:33.749 --> 19:36.001
<i># Well, hold on, baby</i>

19:36.085 --> 19:38.003
<i># Let's sing it again</i>

19:38.837 --> 19:43.342
<i># Let's just pretend that
we go all the way back</i>

19:43.425 --> 19:46.136
<i># Don't tell nobody</i>

19:46.220 --> 19:48.222
<i># It's just me</i>

19:49.139 --> 19:52.810
<i># This shit is free and I got all that you need</i>

19:54.228 --> 19:56.355
<i># Why are we whispering?</i>

19:56.438 --> 19:58.649
<i># Is my face red?</i>

19:58.732 --> 20:00.276
<i># Is it me instead</i>

20:00.359 --> 20:03.112
<i>- # Layin'awake inside your bed?
- Ooh, mami.</i>

20:03.195 --> 20:06.949
<i># You said, I know what you need</i>

20:07.032 --> 20:09.743
<i># It's a nosebleed</i>

20:09.827 --> 20:11.370
Oh.

20:15.124 --> 20:17.459
My name is Guillermo,

20:17.543 --> 20:19.336
not Pedro.

20:21.755 --> 20:23.841
That was a real nice brick dance.

20:29.555 --> 20:31.515
Tell your friend U-Turn,

20:31.599 --> 20:33.934
you tell him he's a lawn jockey now.

20:36.979 --> 20:38.564
Hasta luego.

20:38.647 --> 20:40.190
Yeah. Adi√≥s.

20:48.199 --> 20:50.826
- What the fuck is this?
- Your pot.

20:50.910 --> 20:54.955
He said to tell you
that you're a lawn jockey now.

20:55.039 --> 20:56.165
I'm not sure what that means,

20:56.248 --> 21:00.669
but I figure you two have some sort of
drug-dealer shorthand that I'm not privy to.

21:00.753 --> 21:03.464
You were supposed to pick up a key of jack.

21:03.547 --> 21:06.008
- Jack?
- I had it all promised out.

21:06.091 --> 21:09.303
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with this?

21:09.386 --> 21:11.597
That would be a euphemism for...

21:12.640 --> 21:13.974
heroin?

21:14.058 --> 21:17.311
I'm gonna kill that
bean-farting motherfucker.

21:17.394 --> 21:20.940
- This is your fault, bitch!
- My fault?

21:21.023 --> 21:23.609
Bet your ass.
And you gonna make it right too.

21:24.527 --> 21:26.612
Look...

21:26.695 --> 21:29.657
I'm not a "gangsta". All right?

21:29.740 --> 21:32.576
You never told me what I was
supposed to be picking up.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.453
There's really only so much

21:34.537 --> 21:37.665
you can reasonably expect from me
in these situations.

21:37.748 --> 21:40.918
I did a fucking brick dance for you, OK?

21:41.001 --> 21:42.920
I got a parking ticket.

21:43.003 --> 21:45.464
- A brick dance?
- I did what you told me to.

21:45.548 --> 21:51.387
Let's just sit down like rational people
and start dialling down my debt.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.013
Are you done?

21:56.559 --> 22:00.980
Chop that shit up. Move it.
Bring me back twelve-fi'.

22:01.063 --> 22:05.359
Twelve-five? No way I'm gonna get
twelve-five for a brick.

22:05.442 --> 22:06.944
You got four days.

22:07.027 --> 22:11.282
And I'm taking the money that I gave
that fucking wetback for my jack,

22:11.365 --> 22:13.242
and I'm adding it onto your tab.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.661
Yeah, I'm not stupid, OK.
I know what this is worth,

22:15.744 --> 22:17.955
and it's not twelve-five. Eight, maybe.

22:18.038 --> 22:19.456
Thirteen!

22:19.540 --> 22:21.834
I'm mad, so now I gotta fuck shit up.

22:21.917 --> 22:24.962
I don't got any more shit to fuck up, OK?

22:25.045 --> 22:27.464
I've got kids. I've got bills.

22:27.548 --> 22:31.510
How am I supposed to put food on my table
if you keep upping my debt?

22:35.514 --> 22:38.142
Get a fucking job.

22:41.312 --> 22:46.150
Young man, the theft you committed
of those surveillance cameras

22:46.233 --> 22:49.361
was more than just
a simple act of vandalism.

22:49.445 --> 22:51.488
It was a slap in the face to this community

22:51.572 --> 22:56.535
and the citizens who have dedicated
their time ridding Agrestic of drugs.

22:56.619 --> 22:58.913
So I'm inclined to make an example of you

22:58.996 --> 23:01.498
and your wanton disregard
for civic property.

23:01.582 --> 23:03.000
Excuse me, Judge.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.502
I'd like to speak out on behalf of my son.

23:05.586 --> 23:07.880
- He's normally very responsible...
- Save it, Mrs Botwin.

23:07.963 --> 23:10.216
Mrs Hodes has already
beaten you to the punch.

23:10.299 --> 23:12.426
She's explained that your family
has gone through enough

23:12.509 --> 23:15.346
and asked me to go easy on the boy.

23:15.429 --> 23:20.684
Silas Botwin, you are hereby sentenced
to six months of community service.

23:20.768 --> 23:25.940
Both you and your mother owe Mrs Hodes
a great deal of gratitude.

23:28.651 --> 23:31.320
I think we really need to talk.

23:31.403 --> 23:33.572
Go fuck yourself, Celia.

23:34.323 --> 23:36.534
All right, listen up!

23:36.617 --> 23:39.578
It's my sorry-ass job
to inform you ass-felching,

23:39.662 --> 23:42.456
salad-tossing,
cum-guzzling faggots

23:42.540 --> 23:45.292
that that butt-ugly face
you're staring at this very moment

23:45.376 --> 23:49.547
is one of the most important goddamn faces
you'll ever lay your eyes upon.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.799
That is your battle buddy.

23:51.882 --> 23:54.927
Your battle buddy is like a Siamese twin.

23:55.010 --> 23:59.181
He shits, you shit.
He fucks up, you fuck up.

23:59.265 --> 24:02.184
He goes down, you go down.

24:02.268 --> 24:05.104
- All right, people.
- This is just like 'Nam.

24:05.187 --> 24:06.897
Yeah, you got that right.

24:06.981 --> 24:09.316
I can't wait to kill me some terrorists.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.611
Are you kidding me?
This isn't about terrorism.

24:12.695 --> 24:16.949
We are just pawns in a chess game
for control of the oil production.

24:17.032 --> 24:20.119
Who cares? Bring it on, man.

24:20.202 --> 24:24.456
- Please don't talk to me any more.
- You're gonna shit when I shit.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.083
Six weeks from today,

24:26.166 --> 24:29.378
this entire troop of girl scouts
will be shipped off to Iraq.

24:29.461 --> 24:31.088
So you best pay close attention

24:31.171 --> 24:34.466
to every goddamn word that comes
out of my godly mouth.

24:34.550 --> 24:38.387
Er, Sergeant Bilko, hi. I'm in the wrong place.
They promised me a desk job...

24:38.470 --> 24:41.599
Who in the hell gave you permission
to break rank, you flaccid little dick?

24:41.682 --> 24:43.100
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure...

24:43.183 --> 24:46.729
They promise everybody a desk job,
you useless twat!

24:46.812 --> 24:49.273
- Yeah, I have eight toes.
- And I got four dicks!

24:49.356 --> 24:53.027
So you better fall back in line before I use
one of them to fuck you up the ass with!

24:53.110 --> 24:56.155
Now fall back in line, Botwin!

24:56.238 --> 25:00.159
You people are losers.
You're scumbags, and I am God.

25:00.242 --> 25:03.162
This is gonna be great.

25:03.245 --> 25:05.873
...because I won't be responsible
when you get to Iraq.

25:05.956 --> 25:09.251
And if you don't listen to me, guess what -
you will die!

25:09.335 --> 25:12.129
What are you looking at, you piece of shit?

25:15.132 --> 25:18.552
Well, in light of this incident,
we intend to petition the judge

25:18.636 --> 25:21.805
and ask that Ms Hodes only have access
to her daughter, Isabelle,

25:21.889 --> 25:25.601
on weekends, at the house,
in the presence of Mr Hodes.

25:25.684 --> 25:27.561
That's outrageous.

25:27.645 --> 25:30.689
Weekends at the house
unsupervised by Mr Hodes.

25:30.773 --> 25:32.858
- Nope.
- Fine.

25:32.942 --> 25:35.861
Fine? What do you mean, fine?

25:35.945 --> 25:37.404
I am the mother.

25:37.488 --> 25:40.366
Why aren't his internal fish balls in a vice?

25:40.449 --> 25:44.411
- What happened to the fish?
- The fish gasps when the cow gives milk.

25:44.495 --> 25:46.455
You dried up the cow.

25:46.539 --> 25:48.832
Oh, so now I'm the fish.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.960
What the hell are they talking about?

25:51.043 --> 25:53.546
She's dumping your wife
because she doesn't think she'll get paid.

25:53.629 --> 25:56.006
- I am not a fish, you hear me?
- Oh, this is great.

25:56.090 --> 25:58.133
I am nobody's fish.

25:58.217 --> 26:00.469
She's right, you know. She's not a fish.

26:00.553 --> 26:02.721
She just drinks like one.

26:07.142 --> 26:08.561
Fuck you all.

26:20.447 --> 26:22.616
You want me out of your life.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.368
Fine.

26:24.451 --> 26:27.538
I am out of your life.

26:42.094 --> 26:45.097
- Can we talk about this?
- No, we can't.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.558
Silas, I told you, this is too much.

26:47.641 --> 26:49.518
Make the bags lighter, OK?

26:49.602 --> 26:52.730
Hey! Bidding's up to $2800
on Uncle Andy's guitar.

26:52.813 --> 26:54.773
That's great, sweetie.

26:54.857 --> 26:57.735
- I was just trying...
- To what, Silas, help me?

26:58.235 --> 26:59.904
No, didn't help.

27:00.571 --> 27:03.115
Matter of fact, made it worse, a lot worse.

27:03.199 --> 27:05.451
But I'll tell you how you can help me now.

27:05.534 --> 27:08.621
Make the bags lighter, OK?

27:11.207 --> 27:13.250
- Pizza.
- Wait here. I'll get it.

27:17.755 --> 27:19.965
- Nancy Botwin?
- Yes.

27:20.049 --> 27:22.134
Agent Fundis, DEA.

27:22.218 --> 27:24.511
I'm here to talk about Peter Scottson.

27:26.096 --> 27:28.015
