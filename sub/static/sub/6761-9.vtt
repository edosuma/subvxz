<i>This is
Chief Superintendent Danielson's office.</i>

02:51.587 --> 02:54.131
<i>Hi. Is he in for David Silver?</i>

02:54.214 --> 02:57.342
<i>No, he's not in at the moment.
May I take a message?</i>

02:57.426 --> 02:59.219
<i>Yeah, would you tell him
that David Silver,</i>

02:59.303 --> 03:01.472
<i>the new voice of West Beverly High,</i>

03:01.555 --> 03:03.807
<i>called live and direct
from the Senior Quad</i>

03:03.891 --> 03:05.851
<i>to remind him
that this year's Grudge Week</i>

03:05.934 --> 03:07.895
<i>against Beverly High starts today?</i>

03:07.978 --> 03:10.272
<i>- Isn't that right, Scott?
- Yeah.</i>

03:15.652 --> 03:17.779
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

03:18.864 --> 03:21.325
Did I... Did I do something wrong?

03:34.796 --> 03:37.716
- Brenda, ixnay.
- Where are we going?

03:37.799 --> 03:39.801
- Anywhere but here.
- Really.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.053
- You don't wanna stay?
- No.

03:42.137 --> 03:44.431
- Beverly Centre, or the Pavilion?
- No, Melrose.

03:44.514 --> 03:45.724
What a concept.

03:45.807 --> 03:48.226
Come on, you guys.
Where's your school spirit?

03:48.310 --> 03:50.645
I lost that in the seventh grade.

03:50.729 --> 03:53.398
That's not all she lost in seventh grade.

03:53.481 --> 03:55.567
Can we please go
before I turn into a pom-pom?

03:55.650 --> 03:57.277
Fine, let's go.

04:00.238 --> 04:01.948
- Hey, Steve.
- Brandon.

04:02.032 --> 04:03.658
Did you sign up
for the Battle of the Beverlys?

04:03.742 --> 04:05.785
Well, I would've,
but since I work nights, it's difficult.

04:05.869 --> 04:08.955
- What about you?
- I'm in the co-ed tug of war.

04:09.038 --> 04:10.582
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

04:10.665 --> 04:11.749
- Hey, Dylan.
- Dylan.

04:11.833 --> 04:12.959
Gentlemen.

04:13.042 --> 04:15.170
I didn't think Grudge Week
would be your kind of thing.

04:15.253 --> 04:17.755
Grudge Week is every guy's thing.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.175
What? What? I don't get it.

04:20.257 --> 04:23.720
Well, a lot of the freshmen girls
get into the spirit of the scene

04:23.803 --> 04:25.930
and try to pick up older guys.

04:28.182 --> 04:29.350
Look.

04:29.434 --> 04:33.604
Looks like Minnesota's already
got a little puppy over there.

04:40.028 --> 04:41.988
Mom, this is not funny.

04:42.071 --> 04:44.991
I didn't say it was funny.
I said it was adorable.

04:45.074 --> 04:48.369
Adorable? How about psychotic?

04:48.453 --> 04:51.706
Brandon, the girl has a crush on you.
You should be flattered.

04:51.789 --> 04:55.001
Flattered that a 14-year-old
follows me around all day?

04:55.084 --> 04:56.502
And, you know, the worst part

04:56.586 --> 04:58.462
is if I accidentally
make eye contact with her,

04:58.546 --> 05:01.215
she pretends she's looking
over the rainbow or something.

05:01.299 --> 05:03.467
She's shy, that's all. What's her name?

05:03.551 --> 05:07.555
- I don't know and I don't care.
- Oh, you're such a heartbreaker.

05:10.182 --> 05:12.059
- Hey, Bren.
- Hi, honey.

05:12.685 --> 05:13.769
Hi.

05:16.397 --> 05:18.733
Why is it that she always waits
till your father gets out of town

05:18.816 --> 05:21.402
before she goes theatrical on me?

05:21.485 --> 05:23.237
Let me talk to her.

05:27.908 --> 05:28.951
Hey.

05:29.994 --> 05:31.120
Hi.

05:38.377 --> 05:39.628
Brenda,

05:42.172 --> 05:44.049
are you on something?

05:44.758 --> 05:47.261
- Get out of my room.
- No.

05:47.344 --> 05:50.639
Not until you tell me
what's the matter with you.

05:51.223 --> 05:52.725
Hey, come on.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.311
You can tell me.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.772
It's no big deal.

05:59.189 --> 06:00.649
It's just...

06:01.358 --> 06:03.444
Well, you know how much
I like Kelly and Donna.

06:03.527 --> 06:06.697
I mean, they're practically
my best friends in the world.

06:06.780 --> 06:09.116
But how many days in a row
can you go shopping

06:09.199 --> 06:12.077
before you're declared
officially brain dead?

06:12.160 --> 06:15.330
- Well, what would you rather be doing?
- Well, that's the thing.

06:15.414 --> 06:18.375
When we first got here
I thought I'd try out for cheerleader.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.128
- Well, why don't you?
- I don't know.

06:21.211 --> 06:24.506
All the girls on the squad
are in this obnoxious little clique.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.675
Well, what do you wanna do?

06:26.758 --> 06:30.262
- I want to do something meaningful.
- Meaningful?

06:30.345 --> 06:31.513
Yeah.

06:33.348 --> 06:36.268
Well, you know, Andrea Zuckerman
volunteers at this place.

06:36.351 --> 06:39.521
I think it's called the Rap Line

06:39.604 --> 06:43.483
where they field calls from troubled kids
and help them with their problems.

06:43.567 --> 06:44.609
I don't know.

06:44.693 --> 06:46.570
What, it's not
meaningful enough for you?

06:46.653 --> 06:49.072
No, it sounds fine. It's just...

06:50.448 --> 06:52.158
Andrea Zuckerman?

06:52.742 --> 06:54.327
The kid can't even write
a compound sentence

06:54.411 --> 06:59.499
without stumbling over his participles,
and he says that I am being too critical.

07:00.125 --> 07:03.044
- Andrea.
- Oh, hi, Brenda.

07:03.128 --> 07:04.629
What's up?

07:04.713 --> 07:07.424
Brandon mentioned that you volunteer
at a rap line for teens,

07:07.507 --> 07:11.428
and it sounded like something
I'd like to get involved with.

07:11.511 --> 07:14.264
- You would?
- You sound surprised.

07:14.347 --> 07:16.307
Well, no. It's just that

07:16.391 --> 07:19.686
you have to go through a long
three-month training program

07:19.769 --> 07:22.856
before they even consider
letting you work the phones.

07:22.939 --> 07:24.482
Okay.

07:24.566 --> 07:29.237
And you have to be the kind of person
who is dedicated.

07:30.071 --> 07:31.531
I know that.

07:31.614 --> 07:34.742
Even if that means giving up
most of your social life.

07:34.826 --> 07:36.911
Like I said, I know that.

07:37.412 --> 07:38.579
Good.

07:40.081 --> 07:42.125
Then I'll see you there.

07:42.834 --> 07:43.960
Good.

07:44.961 --> 07:48.464
How long have your mom
and your stepfather been married?

07:48.548 --> 07:52.844
Well, the national hotline number for
teenage runways is 1-800-HIT-HOME.

07:53.302 --> 07:56.222
Okay, so when was the last time
that you got high?

07:56.305 --> 07:58.724
Now, I know it seems
like the end of the world.

07:58.808 --> 08:01.686
We average about five calls a night
from guys your age

08:01.769 --> 08:04.230
whose mother or sisters
catch them masturbating.

08:04.313 --> 08:06.190
Okay, I'm having trouble
trying to follow...

08:06.274 --> 08:08.818
- Really.
...what you're trying to say to me.

08:11.028 --> 08:15.783
Okay, you're getting high before school,
but you say you're not abusing drugs?

08:15.866 --> 08:18.369
Have you thought about talking
to your father?

08:18.452 --> 08:21.205
All right, and will you call me
after you talk to him?

08:21.288 --> 08:23.124
All right. Bye.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.169
<i>- Rap Line.
- Hi, is Brenda there?</i>

08:30.256 --> 08:31.799
Brenda, it's for you.

08:31.882 --> 08:35.177
Can you take it
on the auxiliary line, please?

08:35.260 --> 08:38.264
I specifically told her no personal calls.

08:39.849 --> 08:41.058
Hello?

08:41.140 --> 08:43.477
Donna just told her mom
she wants to get a nose job.

08:43.561 --> 08:45.145
It's a crisis.

08:45.229 --> 08:47.314
- Really?
- So can you talk?

08:47.731 --> 08:51.360
<i>- Not really.
- Do we still want to be a social worker?</i>

08:51.443 --> 08:54.655
- Kelly.
- What time should I rescue you?

08:55.322 --> 08:57.408
They shut the phone lines down
at 10:00.

08:57.491 --> 08:59.493
<i>Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.</i>

09:01.912 --> 09:03.705
That was my ride.

09:05.582 --> 09:07.501
She needed the address.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.090
Here you go, gentlemen.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.688
Hey, Nat,

09:28.689 --> 09:30.190
you and your friend
are gonna have to keep it down.

09:30.273 --> 09:33.235
You're giving the customers
the wrong idea.

09:33.318 --> 09:39.241
My muscles haven't felt this appreciated
since I took my last R and R in Bangkok.

09:40.242 --> 09:43.578
- What are you doing?
- Acupressure.

09:43.662 --> 09:47.958
- Oh, is that like acupuncture?
- Well, kissing cousins.

09:48.041 --> 09:51.253
Both techniques have been used
for centuries in China

09:51.336 --> 09:56.132
to reduce pain,
anaesthetize the body experience.

09:57.384 --> 09:58.552
Yeah?

09:58.635 --> 10:02.013
The main difference is that
with acupuncture you use needles,

10:02.097 --> 10:03.974
whereas with acupressure,

10:04.057 --> 10:07.978
you stimulate the trigger points
with the tips of your fingers,

10:08.228 --> 10:10.605
and the texture of your touch.

10:11.356 --> 10:12.607
Cool.

10:13.191 --> 10:16.027
- You're next.
- Huh?

10:16.111 --> 10:18.154
I wish. I got customers.

10:18.238 --> 10:22.158
Well, we'll have to schedule
a private session for you then,

10:22.534 --> 10:23.868
won't we?

10:27.121 --> 10:29.666
Now, look, if you wake up tomorrow
and you're still feeling bugged,

10:29.749 --> 10:34.420
I want you to give me a call.
We start at 6:00. Just ask for Andrea.

10:36.089 --> 10:37.924
You're welcome, Kevin.

10:38.549 --> 10:40.134
Okay, bye.

10:41.552 --> 10:44.013
I never thought I was going to make it
through that call.

10:44.097 --> 10:45.765
You were terrific.

10:45.848 --> 10:49.143
You all were. Congratulations.
You made it through another night.

10:49.227 --> 10:51.604
Brenda, will we see you again?

10:55.233 --> 10:56.359
Yes.

10:57.819 --> 10:59.695
- Yes, you will.
- Good.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.407
Have a good night.

11:06.619 --> 11:08.412
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:08.579 --> 11:10.623
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.294
So, is Brandon picking you up?

11:15.753 --> 11:17.213
Kelly Taylor.

11:19.423 --> 11:21.467
This takes a real commitment, Brenda.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.928
I know what it takes, Andrea.

11:24.011 --> 11:27.640
And I think I can do this
just as well as anybody else.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.648
Say hi to Brandon for me.

12:15.104 --> 12:17.231
Could you please let me in?

12:17.314 --> 12:18.565
Please?

12:21.568 --> 12:22.611
<i>Gracias.</i>

12:30.744 --> 12:32.329
<i>I'm leaving right now.</i>

12:32.412 --> 12:34.873
- Kelly.
- I'm sorry.

12:34.957 --> 12:37.876
Let me call you right back.
Donna's mom is totally flipping out.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.503
Call me back.

12:56.812 --> 12:58.647
I don't forgive you.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.191
Kelly?

13:01.650 --> 13:04.194
<i>No, this isn't Kelly.</i>

13:05.445 --> 13:08.198
<i>Is there someone there I can talk to?</i>

13:08.281 --> 13:10.784
<i>I really need to talk to someone.</i>

13:11.952 --> 13:13.203
<i>Hello?</i>

13:13.495 --> 13:16.456
<i>I said I really need to talk to someone.</i>

13:18.333 --> 13:19.793
Okay, sure.

13:20.335 --> 13:22.128
You can talk to me.

13:23.296 --> 13:24.756
<i>Who are you?</i>

13:25.924 --> 13:27.217
Brenda.

13:28.384 --> 13:30.386
<i>Are you in high school?</i>

13:31.095 --> 13:32.222
Yeah.

13:32.305 --> 13:35.225
I just started West Beverly
this semester.

13:36.809 --> 13:39.312
How about you? What's your name?

13:41.773 --> 13:43.691
<i>Do I have to tell you?</i>

13:45.401 --> 13:46.986
No, not at all.

13:47.862 --> 13:49.572
I'll just listen.

13:49.656 --> 13:53.326
<i>But whatever I say,
it's just between you and me, right?</i>

13:54.369 --> 13:56.913
<i>- If you want it that way.
- Promise?</i>

13:59.415 --> 14:00.750
Sure.

14:01.501 --> 14:05.296
<i>Well, it's not that I'm not all right.
I'm all right. I really am.</i>

14:05.379 --> 14:06.839
Well, good.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.383
Where are you?

14:10.635 --> 14:13.012
<i>I'm at a pay phone near school.</i>

14:15.598 --> 14:18.100
<i>And what I'm calling about is, see,</i>

14:18.184 --> 14:21.062
<i>there's this guy that goes to my school,</i>

14:21.562 --> 14:25.066
<i>and I really like him a lot
and he says he likes me.</i>

14:26.400 --> 14:27.693
Does he?

14:29.278 --> 14:32.073
I'm sorry, you don't have to answer that.

14:32.198 --> 14:34.408
I shouldn't have said anything.

14:34.492 --> 14:36.369
Go on. I'm listening.

14:38.871 --> 14:40.331
Are you there?

14:41.832 --> 14:43.918
Are you still on the line?

14:44.919 --> 14:47.671
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- I'm here.</i>

14:49.882 --> 14:51.258
<i>I just...</i>

14:53.677 --> 14:55.304
<i>My question is...</i>

14:55.888 --> 14:59.767
<i>Is when you're really making it</i>

15:00.059 --> 15:02.937
<i>and you tell him to stop and he doesn't,</i>

15:04.355 --> 15:06.649
<i>does that mean it's my fault?</i>

15:07.149 --> 15:08.233
No.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.238
I mean, I don't think so.

15:18.494 --> 15:20.996
<i>I guess what I really need to know</i>

15:21.830 --> 15:24.666
<i>is how do you know
if you've been raped?</i>

15:34.092 --> 15:36.678
Whatever you do,
don't be furious with me.

15:36.762 --> 15:39.014
If you would have heard Donna's mother
shrieking over the phone,

15:39.097 --> 15:41.600
you'd understand why I'm so late.

15:42.267 --> 15:43.852
Are you okay?

15:47.397 --> 15:50.192
I am going to get reamed beyond belief.

15:50.275 --> 15:53.487
Why? You didn't do anything wrong.

15:54.112 --> 15:56.448
I broke into the office after hours,

15:56.531 --> 15:59.826
I answered the phone even though
I knew it was supposed to be shut off.

15:59.910 --> 16:01.578
So you thought it was me calling.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.289
But when I found out it wasn't,
I could've hung up.

16:04.372 --> 16:07.292
But you didn't.
She needed somebody to talk to.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.919
That's right.

16:09.252 --> 16:10.962
Someone qualified.

16:14.299 --> 16:17.927
It looked so easy watching Andrea
and the others do it.

16:18.762 --> 16:22.057
But my trouble was, I got totally hung up
the first minute or so,

16:22.140 --> 16:24.684
'cause I kept thinking
that I knew her voice.

16:24.768 --> 16:26.603
You're kidding.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.314
- Who?
- I don't know.

16:30.398 --> 16:33.735
I thought I did, but now I don't even have
a clear picture of what happened.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.570
You think she was lying?

16:35.653 --> 16:39.616
You don't call an anonymous hotline
unless you're in trouble.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.876
Mom, hi.
What are you doing up so late?

16:49.959 --> 16:51.711
Just following your example.

16:51.794 --> 16:55.298
Starting tomorrow, I'll be working
at the recycling centre twice a week.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.301
That's great.
Maybe I could start working there, too.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.219
- We could...
- Well, now, honey,

17:00.303 --> 17:02.555
you don't wanna spread yourself
too thin.

17:02.638 --> 17:07.101
Now, having said that,
I spoke to your father tonight,

17:07.185 --> 17:11.396
and we are so proud of you
for getting involved in this Rap Line.

17:11.481 --> 17:14.650
It sounds like something really positive.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.528
I think they're very lucky to have you.

17:18.195 --> 17:19.696
Thanks, Mom.

17:20.323 --> 17:22.200
<i>Ricky Kravitz</i>

17:29.290 --> 17:31.876
<i>and George Sudaris.</i>

17:37.423 --> 17:38.924
<i>There you have it.</i>

17:39.008 --> 17:42.136
<i>The front line.
The senior class varsity lettermen.</i>

17:45.514 --> 17:47.475
<i>That's right, that's right.</i>

17:47.558 --> 17:49.101
<i>You heard it here first.</i>

17:49.185 --> 17:52.354
<i>Last night was a fluke.
Tonight, it's our turn.</i>

17:57.943 --> 18:00.279
<i>We're gonna win tomorrow night,
and the night after that,</i>

18:00.362 --> 18:03.073
<i>so that we can bring the cup back
to West Beverly where it belongs.</i>

18:03.157 --> 18:05.618
So what happened, then, stud?

18:05.701 --> 18:09.705
Well, then Nina told me
to close my eyes and relax

18:09.788 --> 18:12.875
and centre my energy
which, of course, I did.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.251
I bet you did.

18:14.335 --> 18:17.337
And then she started
rubbing the balls of my feet.

18:17.421 --> 18:19.381
She rubbed the balls of your feet?

18:19.465 --> 18:22.342
We're talking major-league,
prime-time heaven here, man.

18:22.426 --> 18:23.469
The moment she touched me

18:23.552 --> 18:26.180
I got this warm tingling sensation
all over my body

18:26.263 --> 18:28.432
just like she said I would.

18:29.516 --> 18:32.102
Well, after that I put
my shoes and socks back on,

18:32.186 --> 18:33.896
and I helped Nat close down the joint.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.064
- What about Nina?
- She left.

18:36.273 --> 18:38.358
- She left without you?
- Yeah.

18:38.483 --> 18:41.069
Oh, you blew it. Blew it.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.780
- What are you talking about?
- She was coming on to you, Brandon.

18:43.864 --> 18:45.115
Oh, you're crazy, man.

18:45.198 --> 18:47.326
- Brandon.
- You're crazy.

18:47.409 --> 18:49.911
Nina's not interested
in someone my age. She's a woman.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.372
She's traveled all through Asia
and the South Pacific.

18:52.456 --> 18:54.124
- How old is she, Brandon?
- She's old.

18:54.207 --> 18:56.418
She worked at the Peach Pit
the whole time she was in high school.

18:56.501 --> 18:58.545
- Well, how old is she?
- I don't know.

18:58.628 --> 19:01.089
She's got to be at least 23.

19:01.256 --> 19:02.841
Twenty-three?

19:04.843 --> 19:07.554
You blew it. You blew it.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.908
- Andrea.
- Hello.

19:30.493 --> 19:33.121
Look, I had a little trouble
at the Rap Line last night.

19:33.204 --> 19:35.457
It's perfectly all right, Brenda.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.168
Yeah, but I need to talk to you
about something specific.

19:38.251 --> 19:40.378
Like I said when we first talked,

19:40.462 --> 19:45.633
it takes a certain kind of personality
to make it through the program.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.428
- No, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

19:49.012 --> 19:52.265
You don't have to apologize
or feel like you're a bad person.

19:52.348 --> 19:55.184
Most of our trainees
don't make it through the first week,

19:55.268 --> 19:58.229
so you don't have to feel badly
about this at all.

19:58.354 --> 20:00.523
- Really?
- Absolutely.

20:10.491 --> 20:12.452
How are your feet?

20:14.871 --> 20:16.747
Hey, how you doing?

20:16.831 --> 20:20.835
Better than I have been
in my entire existence.

20:20.918 --> 20:23.921
I just took a float
in a sensory deprivation tank.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.464
Have you ever tried it?

20:25.548 --> 20:28.801
- Can't say that I have.
- It is incredible.

20:28.885 --> 20:31.345
First, you take off all your clothes,

20:31.429 --> 20:35.975
and then you get into this tank
filled with this warm soothing water,

20:36.934 --> 20:39.186
and then they close the lid.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.023
Sounds like being in a casket.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.816
And it's just you

20:44.191 --> 20:46.819
left alone with your inner self

20:46.902 --> 20:51.490
to contemplate your most private
and primal thoughts.

20:52.658 --> 20:55.536
So what were you thinking about
in there?

20:56.537 --> 20:57.913
Peach pie.

20:59.331 --> 21:01.709
No, it's true.
Ever since I moved back to LA,

21:01.792 --> 21:04.420
it's practically all
I've been dreaming about.

21:04.503 --> 21:06.797
Well, you want it a la mode?

21:07.381 --> 21:11.135
Don't you just love the way
that rolls off your tongue?

21:11.218 --> 21:12.928
A la mode.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.686
- Nat.
- Huh?

21:20.978 --> 21:23.605
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

21:23.689 --> 21:25.482
What's the story with Nina?

21:25.566 --> 21:27.943
Nina, sweet Nina.

21:28.026 --> 21:30.279
I've never met anyone like her before.

21:30.362 --> 21:32.489
Yup, she's an original.

21:33.866 --> 21:37.244
She gets this twinkle in her eye
every time she talks to me.

21:37.327 --> 21:39.246
You and everyone else.

21:39.329 --> 21:41.790
She likes to flirt with everyone, huh?

21:43.834 --> 21:45.544
Let's just say

21:45.627 --> 21:49.256
when she worked here,
she was definitely a wild child.

21:57.055 --> 21:59.182
Rap Line, this is Andrea.

22:01.852 --> 22:04.146
Brenda, come in.
Glad to have you back.

22:04.229 --> 22:05.480
Thanks.

22:09.693 --> 22:12.445
When a caller doesn't want
to leave a name or a phone number,

22:12.529 --> 22:14.614
how do you get them to trust you?

22:14.698 --> 22:16.616
Well, you have to keep
prodding and listening

22:16.700 --> 22:18.702
until you get them to come around.

22:18.785 --> 22:20.996
The real skill is learning how to listen,

22:21.079 --> 22:24.291
and, of course, knowing what to do
with what you've heard.

22:24.374 --> 22:26.042
Should I get that?

22:26.126 --> 22:29.504
- You know the rules.
- And let me know. Bye.

22:30.463 --> 22:32.382
And what I'm learning now

22:32.465 --> 22:37.137
is the best possible therapy
you could ever do for your skin tone.

22:38.513 --> 22:40.640
It's called an herbal wrap.

22:41.099 --> 22:42.142
What's that?

22:42.225 --> 22:44.853
Well, it's a natural way
to detoxify your system

22:44.936 --> 22:47.605
and re-mineralize your entire body.

22:48.439 --> 22:51.442
- Really?
- It is so great.

22:51.860 --> 22:56.406
First, you get a massage
with all the essential oils

22:56.781 --> 22:59.784
like sage and juniper.

23:00.827 --> 23:04.038
And then you get wrapped in plastic.

23:04.622 --> 23:05.665
Really?

23:05.748 --> 23:10.128
And then we cover your entire body
with these thick, hot steaming towels.

23:10.211 --> 23:11.254
Really?

23:11.337 --> 23:15.174
And then you take a hot shower,

23:16.426 --> 23:18.553
and we rub in all the creams.

23:19.137 --> 23:20.179
Oh.

23:21.431 --> 23:24.016
Listen, I don't really know
how to say this,

23:24.100 --> 23:27.728
but it's really hard for me
to find subjects

23:27.812 --> 23:30.731
who are willing
to let me practice on them.

23:30.815 --> 23:35.361
So I was hoping
that maybe tomorrow after work,

23:35.444 --> 23:39.865
you could come back to my place
and I could try my technique out on you.

23:40.283 --> 23:43.744
That... I think that could be arranged.

23:43.828 --> 23:46.622
I was hoping you'd say that.

23:46.706 --> 23:48.332
Good night, guys.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.336
It never fails.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.004
I'll take it.

23:55.297 --> 23:57.758
Rap Line. This is Andrea, who's this?

23:57.925 --> 24:00.803
<i>- Do I have to give my name?
- No, you don't have to leave your name,</i>

24:00.886 --> 24:04.265
but for next time,
our hours are 6:00 to 10:00.

24:04.348 --> 24:07.893
But... Well, we have a few minutes.

24:07.977 --> 24:10.896
<i>- Are you a first-time caller?
- No, I called last night.</i>

24:10.980 --> 24:12.815
Oh, last night?
Well, who did you talk to?

24:12.898 --> 24:15.651
<i>- Brenda.
- Could you hold on for a second?</i>

24:17.069 --> 24:20.823
Brenda, did you pick up the phone
after hours last night?

24:21.490 --> 24:24.034
I'm sorry. I thought it was my ride.

24:24.118 --> 24:28.080
- Oh, Brenda.
- I can't believe you.

24:28.163 --> 24:29.998
Look, I made a mistake.

24:30.082 --> 24:32.334
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen.

24:32.418 --> 24:36.255
Okay, okay. Calm down.
What's the caller's situation?

24:36.338 --> 24:40.050
- Possible date rape.
- Great. Something simple for a change.

24:40.134 --> 24:43.387
- Look, what are we gonna do?
- Let's give Brenda the phone.

24:43.470 --> 24:45.264
I'll be right next to you
if you get in trouble.

24:45.347 --> 24:46.515
Okay.

24:55.357 --> 24:57.776
<i>- This is Brenda.
- Hi, Brenda.</i>

24:58.485 --> 25:00.487
<i>I'm sorry to bother you again.</i>

25:00.570 --> 25:03.865
Oh, it's no bother.
I was hoping you'd call back.

25:05.826 --> 25:07.619
Where are you?

25:07.703 --> 25:10.330
Are you at the same pay phone?

25:10.414 --> 25:11.832
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:11.915 --> 25:13.417
Are you okay?

25:15.085 --> 25:17.170
<i>No, it happened again.</i>

25:20.215 --> 25:24.469
<i>And he didn't want to kiss me.
He just kept doing it, and it hurt so bad.</i>

25:28.223 --> 25:31.434
I just want to assure you
that we're in no hurry here.

25:31.518 --> 25:34.604
You can take
as much time as you need.

25:34.688 --> 25:36.690
I'm right here for you.

25:37.983 --> 25:40.944
<i>We did it in the parking lot
behind the gym.</i>

25:43.071 --> 25:44.948
Was it the same guy?

25:45.365 --> 25:46.533
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:48.159 --> 25:50.995
<i>I didn't want to do it,
but everyone was partying</i>

25:51.079 --> 25:54.124
<i>because we had just won
this school competition thing.</i>

25:54.207 --> 25:56.084
You mean Grudge Week?

25:56.918 --> 25:58.336
Is that right?

25:58.419 --> 26:00.255
Do you go to Beverly High School
or West Beverly?

26:00.338 --> 26:03.341
<i>I can't talk about this right now.</i>

26:03.424 --> 26:06.010
<i>- I'll call you tomorrow.
- No, wait.</i>

26:24.904 --> 26:26.364
Hi, Brenda.

26:26.447 --> 26:28.491
How are you doing this morning?

26:28.574 --> 26:30.785
All right. Maybe a little shaky.

26:30.868 --> 26:32.578
That's not hard to believe.

26:32.662 --> 26:35.832
Look, Andrea.
You can put me down all you want.

26:35.915 --> 26:37.542
Why would I want to do that?

26:37.625 --> 26:40.545
You handled yourself like a pro
with that caller last night.

26:40.628 --> 26:43.714
It was... It was very impressive.

26:44.882 --> 26:47.635
Well, good. I'm glad you feel that way.

26:48.469 --> 26:51.222
So, on that note,

26:51.305 --> 26:53.724
what do you say we take it from the top?

26:53.808 --> 26:55.559
Okay.

26:55.643 --> 26:59.730
Hi, Brenda.
How are you doing this morning?

26:59.814 --> 27:01.607
I'm climbing the walls.

27:02.191 --> 27:05.486
Every single time I hear a girl's voice,
I whirl around

27:05.569 --> 27:08.614
to see if it matches the voice
that I keep hearing in my head.

27:08.697 --> 27:11.659
You're sure the caller goes
to school here?

27:11.742 --> 27:13.327
Almost positive.

27:13.410 --> 27:16.747
She said she was attacked after, quote,
"We won this competition,"

27:16.830 --> 27:18.874
so she must have been talking
about Grudge Week.

27:18.958 --> 27:22.378
Why? Did we win the three-legged
cat race last night, or what?

27:22.461 --> 27:24.880
Andrea, how can you get away
with being editor of the paper

27:24.964 --> 27:28.175
when you have so much contempt
for the student body?

27:28.258 --> 27:29.968
That obvious, huh?

27:36.141 --> 27:38.268
Can you blame me?

27:41.688 --> 27:43.524
It could be anyone.

27:49.071 --> 27:50.489
Hi, Lucy.

27:54.952 --> 27:56.995
I hate being a freshman.

27:59.039 --> 28:01.208
- Yo, Dylan.
- Yo, what?

28:01.291 --> 28:03.961
- Mind if I pick your brain for a minute?
- Hey, be my guest.

28:04.044 --> 28:06.004
You know you may even find
something in there.

28:06.088 --> 28:07.464
You got some sand in your ear.

28:07.547 --> 28:09.716
Hey, man, it was Manhattan Beach.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.010
The swells were breaking
three to five feet this morning.

28:12.094 --> 28:14.137
- You going out with me again?
- Probably not,

28:14.221 --> 28:16.807
now that I'm on the verge of making it
with an older woman.

28:16.890 --> 28:19.392
Slim, I'm impressed.
Who's the lucky lady?

28:19.476 --> 28:21.812
Her name's Nina.
She used to work at the Peach Pit.

28:21.895 --> 28:24.314
She's hot, but in an organic kind of way,

28:24.397 --> 28:28.151
- kind of like Deborah Winger.
- Have fun.

28:28.235 --> 28:31.696
Hey, listen, you've been with
an older woman before, right?

28:31.780 --> 28:33.490
It's not my style to kiss and tell,

28:33.573 --> 28:37.661
- but... What's your question?
- Okay.

28:37.744 --> 28:38.995
If we,

28:39.663 --> 28:42.749
like, you know, if we do it,

28:42.832 --> 28:44.876
is she gonna expect me
to spend the night?

28:44.959 --> 28:48.963
- It's customary. Yeah.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

28:49.047 --> 28:50.840
How am I going to get around my mom?

28:50.924 --> 28:53.510
Minnesota, you'll figure something out.

28:53.593 --> 28:57.055
Wait, wait.
Just one more thing, real quick.

28:57.138 --> 28:59.098
I ain't going anywhere.

29:00.433 --> 29:01.518
It's kind of embarrassing.

29:01.601 --> 29:02.727
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah, it is.

29:02.811 --> 29:03.895
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah, it is.

29:03.978 --> 29:05.313
- No, it isn't.
- Okay, okay, look.

29:05.396 --> 29:07.357
What I need to know is

29:08.566 --> 29:11.027
the first time you were
with the older woman,

29:11.110 --> 29:14.530
you woke up next to her
and she was lying there,

29:14.989 --> 29:16.658
what'd you say to her?

29:19.911 --> 29:22.121
Would you like a cup of coffee?

29:22.205 --> 29:24.165
That's what I thought.

29:25.249 --> 29:26.793
Thanks, Dylan.

29:27.627 --> 29:28.920
Anytime.

29:33.758 --> 29:35.802
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

29:35.885 --> 29:38.262
No harm, no foul.

29:39.305 --> 29:41.307
So how much they pay you for all these?

29:41.390 --> 29:45.436
About six cents a pound, but I let
the recycling centre keep the money.

29:45.519 --> 29:48.105
Hey, listen, I wanted to make sure
that this was okay.

29:48.189 --> 29:50.858
Tomorrow morning I'm gonna leave
real early, like about 5:00

29:50.942 --> 29:53.027
to do some surfing with Dylan
before school.

29:53.110 --> 29:55.946
- Sounds adventurous.
- But it's okay, right?

29:56.030 --> 29:58.199
- Well, just be careful.
- I will be.

29:59.283 --> 30:03.120
So I might not see you
until after school tomorrow.

30:03.204 --> 30:04.372
Why?

30:04.997 --> 30:07.583
Well, after work tonight
I'm gonna go straight over to the library.

30:07.666 --> 30:09.960
I have to study
for this monster history test.

30:10.044 --> 30:12.087
Probably won't get back
until after you're asleep.

30:12.171 --> 30:14.924
Well, if I'm asleep, don't wake me.

30:15.299 --> 30:16.634
I won't.

30:25.392 --> 30:27.353
Brandon, come on.
I can't be late tonight.

30:27.436 --> 30:30.147
Okay, okay. Just give me two minutes.

30:30.689 --> 30:32.024
Who died?

30:32.608 --> 30:36.153
- I just borrowed some of Dad's cologne.
- Like half the bottle.

30:36.236 --> 30:39.198
Hey, it'll wear off by the time I need it
tonight,

30:39.281 --> 30:41.200
when I'm with Nina.

30:41.909 --> 30:43.077
Sweet Nina.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.662
Brandon, please.
I have to be there by 6:00.

30:45.746 --> 30:48.916
Okay, okay. Thanks for listening to me.

30:53.712 --> 30:55.339
Brandon, I'm sorry.

30:55.422 --> 30:58.050
I'm just so frazzled
with this Rap Line stuff.

30:58.133 --> 31:00.552
Oh, yeah, how's that working out?

31:00.636 --> 31:02.304
Totally intense.

31:03.096 --> 31:04.389
Tell me.

31:05.349 --> 31:06.683
I can't.

31:06.767 --> 31:08.560
Don't worry.
I won't say anything to anybody.

31:08.644 --> 31:10.187
No, it's not that.

31:10.270 --> 31:12.773
There's just this
very specific situation happening

31:12.856 --> 31:16.651
that if I tell you about it, it would be
a complete breach of confidence.

31:16.735 --> 31:19.613
- I won't tell anyone.
- It doesn't matter.

31:19.905 --> 31:23.241
I promised the caller
I wouldn't say anything to anybody.

31:23.408 --> 31:25.702
Fine. Fine.

31:26.286 --> 31:31.208
Just don't expect me to tell you anything
about the 25-year-old woman I'm dating.

31:41.092 --> 31:42.594
- Well, what can I do for you?
- Call me back

31:42.677 --> 31:44.429
and let me know how it went, okay?

31:44.512 --> 31:46.556
Okay, you're welcome. Bye-bye.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.767
Rap Line. May I help you?

31:52.771 --> 31:54.606
Well, if you wanna know
if you're pregnant or not,

31:54.689 --> 31:57.984
you're gonna have to go in
and get the test done.

31:58.068 --> 31:59.986
Can your mom take you?

32:00.945 --> 32:03.364
When do you plan on telling her?

32:04.073 --> 32:05.492
- Well, if you're not gonna tell her...
- Keith.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.410
...what are you gonna do?
- Keith!

32:08.244 --> 32:10.830
Damn it, Keith, I'm sorry,
but you have to pick that up.

32:10.914 --> 32:12.624
It's been ringing off the hook.

32:12.707 --> 32:14.834
Hold on one second, okay?

32:15.585 --> 32:19.088
Rap Line, this is Keith.
Are you a first-time caller?

32:45.865 --> 32:47.074
Follow up tomorrow.

32:47.158 --> 32:49.285
- Okay, thanks.
- Good night.

32:50.745 --> 32:54.290
Look, 15 more minutes.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.876
Fifteen more minutes
is all I'm asking for.

32:56.959 --> 32:58.461
I'm sorry, Brenda.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.630
Why can't we stay?
This girl needs counseling.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.798
- You said so yourself.
- That's right,

33:02.882 --> 33:06.052
but you can't force anyone
to pick up the phone and call us.

33:06.135 --> 33:10.056
And, since she didn't call,
we have to assume that she's okay,

33:10.139 --> 33:12.016
at least for tonight.

33:21.442 --> 33:24.778
I know it's rough,
but the real secret in all of this

33:24.862 --> 33:26.655
is learning how to let it go
when the day is done.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.617
Yeah, particularly for Carol
since she works an 18 hour day.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.953
Sad, but true.
You girls gonna be all right?

33:33.037 --> 33:35.080
Yeah, the bus should be here
in a few minutes.

33:35.164 --> 33:37.041
All right. Good night.

33:37.124 --> 33:38.417
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.669
- Good night. Thanks.
- Take care.

33:47.551 --> 33:49.595
- What are you doing?
- Guess.

33:49.678 --> 33:52.556
- I'm getting Carol.
- No, Andrea, please, listen to me.

33:52.639 --> 33:55.309
The first time she called,
it was around 10:30.

33:55.392 --> 33:58.604
Last night she called right at 10:00,
right when we were leaving.

33:58.687 --> 34:01.398
- So what?
- So it's 10:05.

34:01.523 --> 34:03.192
The phone could be ringing right now.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.652
- You don't know that.
- That's right.

34:05.736 --> 34:09.239
And I won't know
unless I get up there and answer it.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.668
Excuse the mess,
but it's always like this.

34:21.752 --> 34:23.295
No, I love it.

34:26.005 --> 34:30.302
It has a very earthy quality to it.

34:30.385 --> 34:32.846
Yeah? That's what Richard says, too.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.306
Richard?

34:35.639 --> 34:37.266
I thought I heard someone.

34:37.350 --> 34:38.976
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

34:39.561 --> 34:42.313
- How are you?
- I'm good, but I'm swamped.

34:48.027 --> 34:50.237
Now, I'm better and swamped.

34:50.322 --> 34:54.826
Oh, wait, before you go,
I want you to meet Brandon Walsh.

34:54.909 --> 34:57.245
- Hey, how are you?
- How you doing?

34:57.329 --> 34:58.413
Good.

34:58.496 --> 35:00.790
- Brandon's going to be my guinea pig.
- Yeah?

35:00.874 --> 35:03.293
He's letting me do
a full herbal wrap on him.

35:03.376 --> 35:07.714
Hey, well, you're in good hands.
Nina's the best student I ever had.

35:07.797 --> 35:10.258
That's why I fell in love with her.

35:10.341 --> 35:14.220
Richard's teaching holistic medicine
at the Maxwell Institute,

35:14.304 --> 35:16.472
and he's finishing up his doctorate
at USC.

35:16.556 --> 35:19.893
- Great.
- Oh, wait, before I forget.

35:22.770 --> 35:26.024
We give this to all our special friends.

35:26.774 --> 35:29.402
<i>The Tibetan Book of The Dead.</i>

35:32.447 --> 35:33.698
Thanks.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.584
Rap Line. This is Brenda.

35:44.667 --> 35:46.669
<i>Could I speak to a counselor, please?</i>

35:46.752 --> 35:50.381
Sorry, our office hours
are from 6:00 to 10:00.

35:51.215 --> 35:53.384
If you call back tomorrow,
one of our trained volunteers

35:53.467 --> 35:55.720
will be available to take your call.

35:55.803 --> 35:57.597
Yes, good night.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.809
It's been 45 minutes, Brenda.

36:02.935 --> 36:05.980
You'd think one of these calls
would be her.

36:06.063 --> 36:08.816
The phones ring all night around here.

36:10.443 --> 36:11.944
We should go.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.035
For what it's worth,

36:21.912 --> 36:24.665
I'm glad we came back tonight.

36:24.748 --> 36:26.792
For all the good it did.

36:30.004 --> 36:32.089
Well, you want to take it?

36:33.215 --> 36:34.675
Be my guest.

36:38.637 --> 36:41.557
<i>- Rap Line.
- I'm sorry to bother you again.</i>

36:46.145 --> 36:47.688
It's for you.

36:54.361 --> 36:56.739
<i>What do you know? It's me again.</i>

36:56.822 --> 36:58.866
I was hoping you'd call.

36:58.949 --> 37:01.785
<i>Why? So you could sit back
and judge me?</i>

37:01.869 --> 37:03.120
No.

37:03.203 --> 37:04.872
<i>Or get turned on?</i>

37:04.955 --> 37:07.457
<i>- Look...
- Or be Little Miss Mary Sunshine</i>

37:07.541 --> 37:11.295
<i>assuring me that everything's
gonna be all roses and pink.</i>

37:11.378 --> 37:13.797
What happened out there tonight?

37:14.047 --> 37:15.632
Come on. You wouldn't be this angry

37:15.716 --> 37:18.760
and you wouldn't have called us
if nothing happened.

37:18.844 --> 37:21.013
<i>What do you think happened?</i>

37:22.597 --> 37:24.516
I think he found you again.

37:24.599 --> 37:27.519
<i>Yeah, but tonight
he brought along his friend.</i>

37:31.440 --> 37:33.817
<i>- Tell me your name.
- Forget it.</i>

37:34.067 --> 37:37.112
- No, I want to know who you are.
- Brenda.

37:37.195 --> 37:39.531
Look, don't be afraid.

37:39.614 --> 37:42.826
I know it's scary,
but you've got to stand up to them.

37:42.909 --> 37:45.745
You have to make this go away,
so they won't hurt you anymore.

37:45.829 --> 37:49.624
- You shouldn't be telling her this.
- It's the truth, Andrea.

37:50.292 --> 37:52.377
<i>Are you talking about me?</i>

37:55.380 --> 37:58.508
Just with one
of the other student volunteers.

37:58.883 --> 38:01.636
<i>You're a two-faced liar,
just like the rest of them.</i>

38:01.720 --> 38:03.304
That's not true.

38:05.348 --> 38:07.016
<i>What's her name?</i>

38:08.017 --> 38:09.310
Andrea.

38:10.061 --> 38:11.479
<i>Andrea who?</i>

38:12.605 --> 38:14.315
Andrea Zuckerman.

38:21.698 --> 38:24.409
Apparently not one of my bigger fans.

38:26.744 --> 38:28.454
I know who it is.

38:30.206 --> 38:32.125
At least, I think I do.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.270
Excuse me.

38:54.021 --> 38:56.399
- Are you Bonnie?
- Yeah.

38:56.774 --> 38:58.860
- Do I know you?
- Yes.

38:59.944 --> 39:01.404
I'm Brenda.

39:05.658 --> 39:07.785
Listen, with the spirit meeting
this afternoon

39:07.868 --> 39:09.704
and tonight being the last night
of the Grudge Week,

39:09.787 --> 39:11.706
I really don't have a lot of time to talk.

39:11.789 --> 39:13.833
Well, maybe you should make the time

39:13.916 --> 39:15.960
so you won't have
to use the phone tonight.

39:16.043 --> 39:17.670
Look, a lot of what I said,

39:17.753 --> 39:19.672
I might've made it seem worse
than it really was.

39:19.755 --> 39:23.384
- A lot of it was kind of fun.
- Which part?

39:24.051 --> 39:27.054
Where he hurt you
or where he brought his friend along?

39:27.138 --> 39:30.391
Brenda, when I made those calls,
I needed somebody to talk to.

39:30.474 --> 39:31.851
And I was there for you.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.019
Yes, you were,
but on the other end of the line

39:34.103 --> 39:37.022
where I didn't have to see you,
and you didn't know who I was.

39:37.106 --> 39:38.983
And you changed that.

39:39.984 --> 39:44.154
If you tell anybody what I said to you,
if you break your promise to me,

39:44.238 --> 39:46.240
- I'll make you sorry.
- Look, Bonnie.

39:46.323 --> 39:48.492
I know what you're going through.

39:48.575 --> 39:51.787
You're a sophomore.
You want to be popular.

39:51.870 --> 39:53.414
And you want the popular guys
to go out with you.

39:53.497 --> 39:54.581
Shut up.

39:54.665 --> 39:56.333
- But it's not worth it.
- Shut up!

39:56.417 --> 39:59.169
Can't you see they're just using you?

39:59.878 --> 40:02.214
You're just... You're jealous.

40:02.297 --> 40:06.051
You're jealous
because you're a nobody at this school

40:06.135 --> 40:07.511
and I'm...

40:09.263 --> 40:11.557
- I gotta go.
- Bonnie!

40:13.725 --> 40:15.143
Andrea,

40:15.227 --> 40:18.146
- I've been looking all over for you.
- What's wrong?

40:18.230 --> 40:19.606
She doesn't want to come forward.

40:19.690 --> 40:22.192
- You talked to her?
- Face to face.

40:22.818 --> 40:26.029
And if I reveal who she is,
there's no telling what she'll do.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.699
- What a mess.
- What am I gonna do?

40:28.782 --> 40:30.200
You've got to talk to Carol.

40:30.283 --> 40:31.785
You know what she'll say.

40:31.868 --> 40:35.163
"You can't force a kid to seek help
unless they want to help themselves."

40:35.247 --> 40:37.749
Ours is not to reason why.

40:38.041 --> 40:40.836
Ours is but to listen

40:41.253 --> 40:43.213
and try not to cry.

41:02.357 --> 41:04.484
I knew we'd ultimately pull
that sucker out.

41:04.567 --> 41:05.652
In that last event?

41:05.735 --> 41:07.487
Hey, we're just saving
the best for last, right?

41:07.570 --> 41:10.407
The co-ed tug of war
has always been my specialty.

41:10.490 --> 41:12.242
- Way to go, Sanders.
- Hey,

41:12.325 --> 41:15.703
couldn't have done it without you guys
tugging on the rope.

41:16.413 --> 41:18.415
Hey, what're you guys doing tonight?

41:18.498 --> 41:20.166
Nothing special.

41:40.812 --> 41:42.480
Larry doesn't know
the way to Becky's house,

41:42.563 --> 41:44.065
so I'll have to meet you there.

41:44.148 --> 41:47.610
- Well, can't you just walk me to my car?
- I don't want to keep them waiting.

41:47.694 --> 41:51.322
Come on, Jill.
I stuck around just to wait for you.

41:51.406 --> 41:53.908
Please. It'll just take a minute.

42:24.647 --> 42:27.108
Hey, Bonnie. You need a ride?

42:28.526 --> 42:29.985
Not tonight.

42:31.862 --> 42:33.447
Yeah, tonight.

42:34.573 --> 42:37.618
We won. We've got to celebrate.

42:45.209 --> 42:46.710
Please, George.

42:46.794 --> 42:49.505
What's the matter?
Don't you like us? Huh?

42:51.257 --> 42:52.675
Please.

42:52.758 --> 42:55.260
Don't you know how much we like you?

42:55.344 --> 42:56.845
And want you?

42:59.056 --> 43:00.349
Please.

43:01.433 --> 43:03.560
Are you going to make us beg for it?

43:03.644 --> 43:06.397
Or are we gonna have
to get nasty again?

43:06.480 --> 43:07.981
Please.

43:09.316 --> 43:11.443
Get in the car, Bonnie.

43:12.236 --> 43:13.320
No.

43:15.030 --> 43:16.990
Then we'll just have to do it standing up.

43:17.074 --> 43:18.492
Please.

43:19.660 --> 43:22.829
Freeze! Police. Now!

43:22.913 --> 43:26.333
Back off, and put your hands in the air.

43:32.381 --> 43:34.049
You have the right to remain silent.

43:34.132 --> 43:36.593
If you give up the right to remain silent,
anything you say

43:36.677 --> 43:40.514
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

43:56.154 --> 43:58.907
Are you gonna go down
and say something?

43:59.115 --> 44:00.242
No.

44:01.326 --> 44:03.286
I gotta be by myself.

44:10.502 --> 44:13.963
How did she know
this was going to happen like this?

44:14.047 --> 44:16.800
All the calls came after 10:00,

44:16.883 --> 44:19.511
so your sister figured that these attacks

44:19.594 --> 44:23.348
might be taking place
after each Grudge Night event.

44:23.515 --> 44:26.101
How'd she put all that together?

44:27.435 --> 44:29.354
She's a good listener.

44:36.528 --> 44:38.529
Tell her the latest.

44:38.613 --> 44:42.325
Well, my folks absolutely refused
to let me have my nose done,

44:42.408 --> 44:44.953
but instead,
they're buying me a new car.

44:45.828 --> 44:47.789
Life could be worse, huh?

44:48.331 --> 44:49.874
I guess.

44:52.460 --> 44:54.170
So, Brandon, what ever happened
with that older chick

44:54.253 --> 44:57.256
- that was coming on to you?
- We're just good friends.

44:57.340 --> 45:00.676
- Face it, you blew it.
- Nothing was blown.

45:02.011 --> 45:04.305
You know what your problem is?

45:05.097 --> 45:07.308
You're hung up on this age thing.

45:07.391 --> 45:09.435
No, I'm not. Not really.

45:10.102 --> 45:12.021
Well, maybe a little.

45:25.326 --> 45:27.119
You're Lucy, right?

45:28.204 --> 45:30.039
I haven't had a chance
to introduce myself.

45:30.122 --> 45:31.874
I'm Brandon Walsh.

45:31.957 --> 45:33.459
Hi, Brandon.

45:34.001 --> 45:35.920
You have a nice smile.

45:37.338 --> 45:38.672
See you.

45:45.346 --> 45:48.390
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi, Lucy.
