Dwayne Pride?

Eliza.
Oh, thank God.

00:11.936 --> 00:13.335
Hey.

00:13.337 --> 00:15.070
That woman lives with our
target. She knows something.

00:15.072 --> 00:16.972
She has no idea that
Javier is cartel.

00:16.974 --> 00:18.540
What do you think he'll do
to her if he finds out

00:18.542 --> 00:20.509
<i>she's cooperating?</i>
GREGORIO: <i>If we want access,</i>

00:20.511 --> 00:21.743

00:21.745 --> 00:23.245

<i>Javier has a computer</i>

00:23.247 --> 00:24.380

00:26.918 --> 00:27.849
Javier's head on a pike,

00:27.851 --> 00:29.084
they want one of ours.

00:29.086 --> 00:30.386
I did what I thought was best.

00:30.388 --> 00:32.720
You went rogue.
Your career is over.

Thanks.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.769
Thank you for...

01:25.774 --> 01:28.708
Agent Pride, thanks for coming.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.678
I know how close
you and Eliza were.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.880
No, you don't, Garcia.

01:33.882 --> 01:35.482
But you will.

01:35.484 --> 01:36.783
Sorry?

01:36.785 --> 01:38.485
I promised her I'd protect her.

01:38.487 --> 01:40.019
From you.

Now I'm promising you,

D.C. sent me down to
eliminate Ciudad Natal embeds

02:15.088 --> 02:16.522
from New Orleans, and
that's what I've done.

02:16.524 --> 02:17.623
Time for me to go home.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.892
But the face of the Natal,
Javier Garcia,

02:19.894 --> 02:21.660
is still walking around
like he owns the place.

02:21.662 --> 02:22.928
Yeah. But he doesn't.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.963
Not anymore. We've cut him off.

02:24.965 --> 02:27.432
We've frozen his ability to
access his laundered drug money.

02:27.434 --> 02:29.467
The cartel's effectively
defeated.

02:29.469 --> 02:32.070
But Garcia's not, otherwise
he would've bolted

02:32.072 --> 02:33.971
as soon as we found out he
was using the West family

02:33.973 --> 02:36.807
to launder the money.
Why is he still here?

02:36.809 --> 02:39.110
Listen, I'd love nothing more
than to bring Garcia to justice,

02:39.112 --> 02:40.978
but we both know we don't have
enough evidence.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.247
Which is why stopping him
and the Natal

02:43.249 --> 02:45.315
from using New Orleans
as a base of operations

02:45.317 --> 02:47.518
will have to be good enough.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.253
Well, it's not good
enough for me,

02:49.255 --> 02:51.589
and it shouldn't be
for you, either.

02:51.591 --> 02:53.658
Look, I know how badly you feel

02:53.660 --> 02:55.593
about what happened to Eliza.

02:55.595 --> 02:57.161
He didn't just kill Eliza,

02:57.163 --> 02:58.696
he killed two of your agents.

02:58.698 --> 03:00.497
Hey... Don't you think
I know that?

03:00.499 --> 03:02.799
Don't you think it makes me sick
to my stomach...

03:02.801 --> 03:04.501
Then let's do something
about it.

03:04.503 --> 03:07.137
Look, there's nothing
to be done. It's over.

03:07.139 --> 03:09.373
It's not over
for Eliza's family.

03:09.375 --> 03:10.774
They've done nothing
but good for this city,

03:10.776 --> 03:12.943
and now because
Garcia used them,

03:12.945 --> 03:14.411
they're financially ruined,

03:14.413 --> 03:16.913
their name is ruined.

03:16.915 --> 03:18.448
You walk away,
that doesn't change.

03:18.450 --> 03:19.849
This isn't just
personal for you,

03:19.851 --> 03:21.184
you know, Pride?

03:21.186 --> 03:22.686
It's personal for me, too.

03:22.688 --> 03:25.622
And not just because
of what happened to my agents.

03:25.624 --> 03:27.423
Gregorio.
We were a team.

03:27.425 --> 03:28.825
At least I thought we were.

03:28.827 --> 03:30.660
But she... she changed
when she came down here.

03:30.662 --> 03:32.062
You... You changed her.

03:32.064 --> 03:34.564
You're blaming me
for you firing her?

03:34.566 --> 03:35.931
No. Of course not. I'm...

03:35.933 --> 03:37.500
Look, I'm ju... I'm just...

03:37.502 --> 03:40.803
I'm saying that we both
lost something in the process.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.905
We both wanted more,

03:42.907 --> 03:44.574
but stopping Garcia,

03:44.576 --> 03:47.743
defeating the Natal.
It's the best that we can do.

03:47.745 --> 03:49.344
Not the best I can do.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.846
Yeah. Well, it'd better be,
or it'll be

03:50.848 --> 03:52.514
the last thing you do.

03:54.351 --> 03:57.185
Now, Garcia is a matter

03:57.187 --> 03:59.955
for the FBI now, not NCIS.

03:59.957 --> 04:02.024
If we can find a way
to prosecute him, we will,

04:02.026 --> 04:03.959
but you're not to go
after him on your own.

04:03.961 --> 04:06.361
I don't answer to you.
No. But we both answer

04:06.363 --> 04:08.563
to people who originally
sent me down here

04:08.565 --> 04:11.933
to see if you and your team
should be disbanded, remember?

04:11.935 --> 04:13.668
Now, don't make me
change my recommendation.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.036
Leave Garcia alone.

04:18.642 --> 04:21.510
(plane flies overhead)

04:27.751 --> 04:29.884
Don't I know you?

04:29.886 --> 04:32.987
Lasalle.
What are you doing here?

04:32.989 --> 04:35.356
Just couldn't wait for you
to get back, I suppose.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.224
Uh-huh. Let me guess,

04:37.226 --> 04:38.925
we got a case already.

04:38.927 --> 04:41.728
Well, I'm not sure, but Pride
wants all hands on deck.

04:41.730 --> 04:44.465
Think it's got something
to do with Javier Garcia.

04:44.467 --> 04:45.666
Over here.

04:45.668 --> 04:47.868
Yeah, but I talked to Patton.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.371
He said that you guys busted
up Garcia's cartel money,

04:50.373 --> 04:52.706
and FBI was taking
the case back to D.C.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.908
Knowing Pride,
that didn't sit well with him.

04:54.910 --> 04:58.444
I heard Isler fired Gregorio.
You talk to her?

04:58.446 --> 04:59.746
She okay?

04:59.748 --> 05:01.281
Yeah. She's pretty rocked.

05:01.283 --> 05:03.216
Got a raw deal, if you ask me.

05:03.218 --> 05:06.219
D.C. wanted a scapegoat
for letting Garcia off the hook,

05:06.221 --> 05:07.688
and she was it.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.455
Yeah. That sucks.

05:09.457 --> 05:10.891
Yep.

05:11.993 --> 05:13.393
(toy squeaking)

05:15.997 --> 05:17.597
Sorry.

05:17.599 --> 05:19.632
That's all right, life goes on.

05:19.634 --> 05:22.034
Yeah. But it's got to sting
for a while. You know,

05:22.036 --> 05:24.103
you can't think you're a dad,
then find out you're not,

05:24.105 --> 05:26.772
and just move on.
Look at you.

05:26.774 --> 05:28.908
You get back from helping
your mama with your stepdad,

05:28.910 --> 05:31.010
and you're more worried
about me and Gregorio.

05:31.012 --> 05:32.544
Hmm.
By the way, how's he doing?

05:32.546 --> 05:35.480
My stepdad? He died.

05:37.852 --> 05:40.385
Oh. Don't give me that look,
you know we weren't close.

05:40.387 --> 05:43.823
I just went back to help my mom.
You want to talk about it?

05:43.825 --> 05:46.858
Probably about as much
as you want to talk about this.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.393
(toy squeaking)

05:48.395 --> 05:51.930
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

05:51.932 --> 05:52.997
You don't
answer the phone.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.633
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

05:54.635 --> 05:56.235
I've been concentrating.
I'm trying to catch up

05:56.237 --> 05:57.969
on all this lab work
I've been neglecting.

05:57.971 --> 06:01.472
I thought you'd be home,
packing for NCIS training.

06:01.474 --> 06:05.009
No. I'm kind of rethinking
the whole agent thing.

06:05.011 --> 06:07.545
It was a good idea at the time,
but I sort of didn't factor in

06:07.547 --> 06:09.580
the whole shooting
and dying part.

06:09.582 --> 06:13.151
Or rather, the not shooting and
almost dying part, in my case.

06:13.153 --> 06:15.419
That's not your fault.
You were not prepared to know

06:15.421 --> 06:17.888
how and when
to shoot a gun, Sebastian.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.690
That's what the training's for.

06:19.692 --> 06:21.191
Yeah? Well, try telling
that to Gregorio.

06:21.193 --> 06:22.493
I almost got her killed.

06:22.495 --> 06:24.295
I mean,

06:24.297 --> 06:27.265
it wasn't just the lack of
training that made me freeze up.

06:27.267 --> 06:30.334
It was also...
a lack of confidence.

06:30.336 --> 06:31.586
Oh. You're being too hard
on yourself.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.104
No, I'm not.

06:33.105 --> 06:35.672
You know, it's one thing to
want to expand your horizons,

06:35.674 --> 06:38.242
but when other people's lives
depend on it?

06:38.244 --> 06:40.644
No, I want to help the team,
not hurt them.

06:40.646 --> 06:42.545
I'm just not sure how I can.

06:42.547 --> 06:43.947
Well, Pride thinks you can.

06:43.949 --> 06:45.749
Because he asked me
to find you.

06:45.751 --> 06:47.751
Wanted to see us both, A.S.A.P.

06:49.521 --> 06:51.187
PATTON: <i>It's called</i>
<i>Gamblers Anonymous,</i>

06:51.189 --> 06:53.122
which, by definition,

06:53.124 --> 06:54.891
is supposed to mean anonymous.

06:54.893 --> 06:56.293
Patton, relax, man.
It's not anonymous

06:56.295 --> 06:57.560
when we all know.

06:57.562 --> 06:59.061
Still, man's in a meeting,

06:59.063 --> 07:00.397
he gets yanked out
in the middle of it,

07:00.399 --> 07:02.299
before I can even get
my eight-year cake?

07:02.301 --> 07:04.033
Well, eight years not gambling,

07:04.035 --> 07:05.702
you're allowed to miss a
meeting or two, can't you?

07:05.704 --> 07:07.236
PATTON:
See?

07:07.238 --> 07:08.570
You don't even know
how this thing works.

07:08.572 --> 07:10.139
You ain't supposed
to miss one.

07:10.141 --> 07:11.240
Especially the one
where you were supposed

07:11.242 --> 07:12.675
to get your damn cake.

07:12.677 --> 07:13.642
This better be good.

07:13.644 --> 07:15.344
It is.

07:17.015 --> 07:18.881
Hey.
SONJA: Gregorio!

07:18.883 --> 07:20.549
I knew you'd be back.

07:20.551 --> 07:21.818
What's going on here?

07:21.820 --> 07:23.852
Sorry to drag you all in
like this,

07:23.854 --> 07:24.886
but it's important.

07:24.888 --> 07:26.054
Everything all right, Dwayne?

07:26.056 --> 07:28.357
It will be, after we bring down
Javier Garcia.

07:28.359 --> 07:29.725
GREGORIO:
Which I'm in on, too.

07:29.727 --> 07:32.160
Gregorio and I have been
going over his files,

07:32.162 --> 07:34.062
looking for a way.
Turns out, the end

07:34.064 --> 07:36.131
of every month, Garcia's
expected to send a chunk

07:36.133 --> 07:39.034
of laundered money to
his drug lord in Bogota,

07:39.036 --> 07:40.702
Pablo Ortiz.

07:40.704 --> 07:41.669
Well, how big a chunk?

07:41.671 --> 07:42.938
$20 million big.
(whistles)

07:42.940 --> 07:44.039
(whistles)

07:44.041 --> 07:45.540
Problem is,
since the FBI's frozen

07:45.542 --> 07:47.108
Eliza's family's assets,

07:47.110 --> 07:49.945
Garcia won't be able to make
his monthly payment,

07:49.947 --> 07:52.047
which is in two days.

07:52.049 --> 07:54.615
Ortiz'll kill him. Ugly, too.

07:54.617 --> 07:56.218
He's not gonna put up with that.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.285
Then, why isn't Garcia
running for his life?

07:58.287 --> 08:00.054
He must have some way to pay
that we don't know about.

08:00.056 --> 08:02.990
Exactly, which means if we can
find that way and cut it off...

08:02.992 --> 08:04.359
Garcia's a dead man.
Mm-hmm.

08:04.361 --> 08:06.293
Unless he wants to confess,

08:06.295 --> 08:08.663
in exchange for our protection.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.298
What's the catch?

08:11.300 --> 08:12.433
Catch is,

08:12.435 --> 08:14.134
not an NCIS case.

08:14.136 --> 08:17.137
Isler made it clear
he'll have us disbanded

08:17.139 --> 08:19.173
if we go after Garcia.

08:19.175 --> 08:21.075
But he can't hold it
against any of you

08:21.077 --> 08:22.409
if you're not involved,

08:22.411 --> 08:23.543
which is why Gregorio and I

08:23.545 --> 08:24.611
are going it alone.

08:24.613 --> 08:26.013
Got to protect your careers

08:26.015 --> 08:27.514
and this office, in case things

08:27.516 --> 08:29.750
go sideways, understand?

08:31.253 --> 08:34.087
Like hell you're going
at it alone.

08:34.089 --> 08:35.922
What he said.
What she said.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.090
What they said.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.927
Don't look at me, I'm with them.

08:57.609 --> 09:00.077
Fresh chicory, who wants more?

09:00.079 --> 09:01.026
I'm fine, thanks.

09:01.050 --> 09:03.147
Oh, you've got to keep
your adrenaline up,

09:03.148 --> 09:04.847
there's a lot at stake.

09:04.849 --> 09:07.483
PRIDE: Wait, where'd
these Garcia files come from?

09:07.485 --> 09:08.851
These yours, Gregorio?

09:08.853 --> 09:11.054
PATTON:
No. They're Isler's.

09:11.056 --> 09:12.789
You know, for a FBI mucky-muck,

09:12.791 --> 09:15.324
he sure doesn't know much
about cyber security.

09:15.326 --> 09:17.493
Hack-a-Pat strikes again.

09:17.495 --> 09:19.596
Take it easy, Patton. I don't
want you getting in trouble.

09:19.598 --> 09:21.663
Ha. Look who's talking.

09:21.665 --> 09:22.831
SEBASTIAN: Wait a minute.
All right. What is that?

09:22.833 --> 09:24.666
Can you put that
up on the plasma?

09:24.668 --> 09:26.969
GREGORIO: Those are
the West family businesses

09:26.971 --> 09:29.472
Garcia's been using
to launder drug money.

09:29.474 --> 09:31.440
Yeah. But what's this...
what's this Cayman account,

09:31.442 --> 09:34.276
with, uh, $2 million in deposits
and no withdrawals?

09:34.278 --> 09:35.611
It's the only one with
Garcia's name on it.

09:35.613 --> 09:36.678
It could be he's
skimming a little

09:36.680 --> 09:39.014
off the top for himself.
Can you seize it?

09:39.016 --> 09:39.691
Offshore means it's untouchable.

09:39.715 --> 09:41.350
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, plus it's
nowhere near the $20 million

09:41.351 --> 09:42.085
he needs anyway.

09:42.109 --> 09:44.568
Unless he's planning on
betting the $2 million

09:44.722 --> 09:47.288
in hopes to turn it into 20.

09:47.290 --> 09:50.058
(chuckles) Looks like
our boy like the ponies.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.827
He's been spending
time at the track.

09:51.829 --> 09:54.962
PRIDE: Which, apparently,
is where he's at right now.

09:54.964 --> 09:56.364
Christopher said
they just pulled up.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.733
Wait, slow down. Are you
seriously suggesting

09:58.735 --> 10:00.401
Garcia thinks he can make back

10:00.403 --> 10:02.570
the $20 million
he owes on a bet?

10:02.572 --> 10:04.239
SEBASTIAN: It might be
his only way, right?

10:04.241 --> 10:07.074
After all, he's only got
two days, or he's dead.

10:07.076 --> 10:08.743
Still, it's a big
risk, even for Garcia.

10:08.745 --> 10:10.778
How could he even know
that he's gonna win?

10:10.780 --> 10:12.813
Unless he cheats.

10:12.815 --> 10:16.117
Been there, done that.
Y'all know.

10:16.119 --> 10:18.152
You want to fill me in?

10:18.154 --> 10:21.388
Okay, a few years ago,
eight to be exact...

10:21.390 --> 10:22.623
Patton got into a little trouble

10:22.625 --> 10:24.424
with the Louisiana
Gaming Commission.

10:24.426 --> 10:25.559
A lot of trouble, actually.

10:25.561 --> 10:27.093
Short story,
I got so addicted

10:27.095 --> 10:28.662
to games of chance

10:28.664 --> 10:30.164
that I took to
upping the ante.

10:30.166 --> 10:32.299
I used my computer skills
to game the system,

10:32.301 --> 10:33.800
i.e. I cheated.

10:33.802 --> 10:36.903
And I had to convince
the feds to let him apply

10:36.905 --> 10:40.407
his unique talents to
Fleet Cyber Command.

10:40.409 --> 10:42.576
Which, getting back
to Garcia,

10:42.578 --> 10:44.778
the man's got to be
juicing the horses.

10:44.780 --> 10:46.379
You know, he's probably
paying off the jockeys

10:46.381 --> 10:48.081
to inject them
right before the race.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.883
Yeah, but doesn't
the Racing Commission

10:49.885 --> 10:51.117
test the horses
after the race?

10:51.119 --> 10:52.618
Yes, but it's not
always easy

10:52.620 --> 10:54.120
to detect a stimulant.

10:54.122 --> 10:57.456
Especially if it's
organic or mineral,

10:57.458 --> 10:58.892
like cobalt.

10:58.894 --> 11:01.627
Well, I like
the ponies, too.

11:01.629 --> 11:03.729
And poker, craps, roulette.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.498
Anybody else have any secrets?

11:05.500 --> 11:09.168
Dwayne, what I know might
come in handy for this.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.369
I'll take all the help
I can get, Loretta.

11:10.371 --> 11:12.137
The question is,

11:12.139 --> 11:13.906
if Garcia's gonna cheat to win,

11:13.908 --> 11:17.275
how can we make sure
he loses instead?

11:18.612 --> 11:20.679
ANNOUNCER: And the others
are left in his wake.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.014
They come to the wire.

11:22.016 --> 11:24.917
It is Whiskey Tail.

11:24.919 --> 11:26.785
Flowers for Whiskey Tail.

11:28.322 --> 11:29.554
Here's your lineup
for the upcoming race:

11:29.556 --> 11:34.025
number one
is Colonel Hot Cakes...

11:34.027 --> 11:35.627
Number two...

11:35.629 --> 11:37.329
SONJA: What's Mayor Hamilton
doing in Garcia's box?

11:37.331 --> 11:39.097
LASALLE:
I don't know.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.367
Looks like Garcia got over his
fiancée's death pretty quick.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.535
That's pretty easy to do

11:43.537 --> 11:45.303
when you're the one
who had her killed.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.240
There's no way Hamilton knows
who Garcia really is, does he?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.275
I wouldn't put anything
past His Honor.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.011
Real question is,
what is Garcia's plan?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.781
He hasn't even
placed a bet yet.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.349
Well, if Patton's right,

11:58.351 --> 12:00.551
he's not just here
as a spectator. (phone ringing)

12:02.756 --> 12:05.822
No sign of any movement
from Garcia yet, King.

12:05.824 --> 12:07.524
Went straight to his box.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.293
Maybe he's got more money
hidden somewhere than we know.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.895
Yeah, still, he's at the track
for a reason.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.464
He's gotta be there
to make a bet, doesn't he?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.733
Except he doesn't have
to place a bet at the track

12:15.735 --> 12:17.000
if he's gonna bet OTB.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.136
OT what?
WADE: Off-track betting.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.904
It's like casinos, except
you can bet on pretty much

12:20.906 --> 12:22.873
any sporting event,
anywhere, anytime.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.207
SONJA: Hold on.

12:24.209 --> 12:25.742
So Garcia still hasn't
placed his bet yet?

12:25.744 --> 12:27.343
PATTON:
No. But if it's OTB,

12:27.345 --> 12:28.645
he could use his phone

12:28.647 --> 12:29.946
and transfer the
$2 mil electronically.

12:29.948 --> 12:31.447
Well, can't you hack into it?

12:31.449 --> 12:33.150
Keep him from even
making the bet?

12:33.152 --> 12:34.184
SEBASTIAN:
No, not without him knowing.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.285
The best we could do is

12:35.287 --> 12:36.452
see what horse
he's betting on.

12:36.454 --> 12:37.720
Well, that won't
do us any good.

12:37.722 --> 12:39.689
Especially if the horse
is juiced and wins.

12:39.691 --> 12:40.790
LASALLE:
Hold on a sec.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.024
Horse can't win

12:42.026 --> 12:43.293
if it doesn't
even start, right?

12:43.295 --> 12:45.027
What are you thinking,
Christopher?

12:45.029 --> 12:47.463
Well, there's no time
to explain, all right, trust me.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.932
Get the name of the horse
Garcia's betting on,

12:49.934 --> 12:52.134
and then get back to me ASAP.

12:52.136 --> 12:53.670
Hey, just for the record,

12:53.672 --> 12:55.070
I have no idea what's going on.

12:55.072 --> 12:56.105
Oh, you will.

12:56.107 --> 12:57.406
Look, there's a bungee cord

12:57.408 --> 12:58.974
behind my seat in the truck.

12:58.976 --> 13:00.843
Get it and meet me
at the starting gate.

13:00.845 --> 13:03.012
Tease me about being
a country boy all you want,

13:03.014 --> 13:04.513
but it's about to pay off.

13:04.515 --> 13:06.481
Go.

13:06.483 --> 13:08.818
ANNOUNCER:
And they're off.

13:12.523 --> 13:14.923
Two minutes to post
for the seventh race.

13:14.925 --> 13:16.591
Pick Four, Sweepstakes, and...

13:16.593 --> 13:17.793
Hey,

13:17.795 --> 13:18.893
here you go.
All right, nice.

13:18.895 --> 13:21.029
You know which one it is?
Don't know yet.

13:21.031 --> 13:24.633
Problem is Garcia is
placing his bet as we speak.

13:26.403 --> 13:27.736
<i>But I got to know</i>
<i>which horse it is</i>

13:27.738 --> 13:29.237
before it enters the gate.

13:29.239 --> 13:30.538
Otherwise it's too late.

13:30.540 --> 13:31.706
Too late for what?

13:31.708 --> 13:34.075
To spook the horse.

13:34.077 --> 13:35.609
LASALLE: Oh, man.
They're getting in the gate.

13:35.611 --> 13:36.845
Find me a rock.

13:38.614 --> 13:40.114
Patton better hurry.

13:40.984 --> 13:42.851
Here. Hey!

13:42.853 --> 13:44.085
You're not gonna
hurt it, are you?

13:44.087 --> 13:45.753
City Mouse.

13:45.755 --> 13:47.388
(horse neighs)

13:47.390 --> 13:49.089
(phone chimes)
Wait, wait, wait.

13:49.091 --> 13:53.494
Patton just said
"Garcia placed a bet

13:53.496 --> 13:55.262
on number five,
'Go for Broke'."

13:55.264 --> 13:56.897
Go for Broke.

13:56.899 --> 13:58.866
It doesn't get much
more poetic than that.

13:58.868 --> 14:00.868
SONJA:
Oh, there it is.

14:05.774 --> 14:07.440
(horse neighs)

14:07.442 --> 14:10.610
(crowd gasps)

14:10.612 --> 14:11.945
ANNOUNCER:
Looks like we have something

14:11.947 --> 14:13.180
happening down on the track.

14:13.182 --> 14:15.615
What the hell?

14:15.617 --> 14:17.150
Javier, Javier,
what's the matter?

14:17.152 --> 14:20.019
SONJA:
Ooh, Garcia looks really pissed!

14:21.022 --> 14:22.722
So what, that's it?

14:22.724 --> 14:24.691
He just lost
$2 million?

14:24.693 --> 14:26.926
It doesn't quite
work that way.

14:26.928 --> 14:29.295
All we did was
buy some time.

14:29.297 --> 14:31.330
ANNOUNCER:
Looks like we've got a scratch.

14:31.332 --> 14:34.666
Go for Broke is a late scratch.

14:34.668 --> 14:37.736
But wait a minute, Garcia still
gets his wager back.

14:37.738 --> 14:39.305
You don't lose a bet
on a scratch.

14:39.307 --> 14:41.274
Right. It's as if the bet
was never placed.

14:41.276 --> 14:43.142
Which means Garcia can
still place another bet

14:43.144 --> 14:44.610
on another horse
by tomorrow night.

14:44.612 --> 14:45.978
WADE: It has to be
a sure thing, though.

14:45.980 --> 14:48.347
And unless he tries
to cheat again,

14:48.349 --> 14:49.815
there aren't any
of those.

14:49.817 --> 14:50.916
Still, Garcia's desperate.

14:50.918 --> 14:51.917
I mean, he's got
to find a way

14:51.919 --> 14:53.051
or he's dead.

14:53.053 --> 14:54.953
PRIDE: Patton might have
found a way.

14:54.955 --> 14:57.122
If we can get Garcia
to bet on it, he'll lose.

14:57.124 --> 14:58.557
Big time.

15:00.227 --> 15:03.128
Then he'll have to either
answer to the cartel

15:03.130 --> 15:05.564
or to us.

15:20.747 --> 15:22.702
Garcia's running out of time.

15:22.704 --> 15:25.171
He has to turn
the last $2 million he's got

15:25.173 --> 15:26.806
into the 20 he needs.

15:26.808 --> 15:29.008
Otherwise, Pablo Ortiz
rips his heart out.

15:29.010 --> 15:30.376
So far I'm with you.

15:30.378 --> 15:32.678
Yeah, which means if we can
get Garcia to think

15:32.680 --> 15:34.614
that he's betting
on a sure thing,

15:34.616 --> 15:36.549
he won't be able
to pass it up, right?

15:36.551 --> 15:38.317
In theory, yeah.

15:38.319 --> 15:40.653
But how do we get him to think
he's betting on a sure thing?

15:40.655 --> 15:42.521
Same way I almost conned
a whole bunch of folks

15:42.523 --> 15:44.123
at a certain
off-track betting site

15:44.125 --> 15:45.657
eight years ago.

15:45.659 --> 15:47.359
Unfortunately for you,
that included a certain admiral.

15:47.361 --> 15:49.261
Fortunate, it put me
on the wagon.

15:49.263 --> 15:51.563
Unfortunate, it put Pride
on the case,

15:51.565 --> 15:53.365
which is how I got
my butt busted.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.968
I was this close
to pulling off

15:55.970 --> 15:57.636
that sweet con, too.

15:57.638 --> 15:58.804
Still have a chance

15:58.806 --> 16:00.839
if we can pull it off
on Garcia.

16:00.841 --> 16:02.307
So when are you gonna
let us in on it?

16:02.309 --> 16:03.842
All right, check it out.

16:03.844 --> 16:05.944
This is eighth race,
Fair Grounds.

16:05.946 --> 16:08.046
Just finished, right?

16:08.048 --> 16:11.149
You got a happy,
cheering crowd.

16:11.785 --> 16:14.385
And now check out that race.

16:14.387 --> 16:16.421
ANNOUNCER:
They're at post.

16:16.423 --> 16:17.721
They're off.

16:18.358 --> 16:19.824
Salad Scooter breaks best...

16:19.826 --> 16:21.259
Isn't that the same race?

16:21.261 --> 16:22.693
Indeed it is.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.929
And that is the essence
of said con.

16:24.931 --> 16:27.798
You take control of a certain
off-track betting site,

16:27.800 --> 16:29.700
including every handheld device,

16:29.702 --> 16:32.035
computer and TV in the place.

16:32.037 --> 16:33.771
Then digitally delay
the already-completed

16:33.773 --> 16:37.074
horse race to the site.
Where nobody knows it started yet.

16:37.076 --> 16:38.609
So you can bet
on the winning horse

16:38.611 --> 16:40.878
of a race that's
already been run.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.245
That's pretty brilliant.

16:42.247 --> 16:44.147
More like sweet!

16:44.149 --> 16:46.484
Still, talk about
your long shots.

16:46.486 --> 16:49.252
Look, first thing to do is
take over an OTB site.

16:49.254 --> 16:52.089
All right? And Patton knows
the owner of one.

16:52.091 --> 16:54.691
PATTON: One that happens to be
the most swankiest of swanky.

16:54.693 --> 16:56.559
He owes me a solid,
so it won't be a problem.

16:56.561 --> 16:57.995
It's gonna be hard
convincing Garcia

16:57.997 --> 16:59.429
in such a short period of time.

16:59.431 --> 17:01.031
PRIDE: Yeah, well, got that
figured out, too.

17:01.033 --> 17:03.433
Just got to find
somebody that he trusts

17:03.435 --> 17:06.569
to convince him, and
I think I know who.

17:06.570 --> 17:09.005
I'm gonna need
everyone's help on this.

17:09.007 --> 17:11.040
If Garcia sees me around,

17:11.041 --> 17:12.742
any chance of
pulling this off

17:12.743 --> 17:14.377
will be lost.

17:14.378 --> 17:15.811
You can handle the rest, Patton?

17:15.814 --> 17:17.246
PATTON: You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

17:17.248 --> 17:18.481
All right,
what do you need?

17:18.483 --> 17:20.182
I need you to watch
Sebastian's back

17:20.184 --> 17:21.650
at the OTB.

17:21.652 --> 17:23.118
Wait, my back? Why's
my back need watching?

17:23.121 --> 17:24.319
You'll see.
You'll love it.

17:24.321 --> 17:25.621
Fine, but who's gonna
watch your back?

17:25.623 --> 17:27.089
I mean, no offense,
but there's a lot

17:27.090 --> 17:29.125
of gambling involved here--
you gonna be all right?

17:29.127 --> 17:30.692
That's the back I've got.

17:30.694 --> 17:32.561
I'm counting on you,
Miss Loretta,

17:32.563 --> 17:34.296
'cause after this con is over,

17:34.298 --> 17:36.365
I want my damn birthday cake.

17:40.871 --> 17:43.005
PRIDE:
Mr. Mayor.

17:43.007 --> 17:45.507
Oh, dear.

17:45.509 --> 17:47.543
(chuckles)

17:47.545 --> 17:48.844
What'd I do now?

17:48.846 --> 17:50.311
PRIDE:
Paranoid about

17:50.313 --> 17:52.280
something in particular,
are you?

17:52.282 --> 17:54.315
Paranoid in general.
I mean, after all,

17:54.317 --> 17:56.384
the urgent call, urgent meet.

17:56.386 --> 17:57.818
Not at City Hall.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.820
Nothing, uh...

17:59.822 --> 18:01.122
nothing good could
come from that.

18:01.124 --> 18:05.360
Actually...
I need your help.

18:05.362 --> 18:07.595
Going after Javier Garcia.

18:07.597 --> 18:09.830
Need to make him pay
for what he's done.

18:09.832 --> 18:12.066
Well, I don't really know
how much of a help I can be

18:12.068 --> 18:14.401
since I don't really
know the man.

18:14.403 --> 18:16.136
Well, you know him
well enough

18:16.138 --> 18:18.172
to share his box
at the track

18:18.174 --> 18:21.175
on the same day that
Eliza West gets buried.

18:21.177 --> 18:22.910
And the implication is?

18:22.912 --> 18:25.012
Garcia's made a lot
of high-level inroads

18:25.014 --> 18:26.847
in New Orleans quickly.

18:26.849 --> 18:30.250
We both know that can't happen
without your help.

18:30.252 --> 18:33.287
The kind that probably
wouldn't stand up

18:33.289 --> 18:34.621
to FBI scrutiny.

18:34.623 --> 18:36.156
Uh, I'm the mayor.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.991
I attract business.
That's my job.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.926
Just like every other
mayor before me.

18:39.928 --> 18:42.196
Both of whom are
still in jail-- my point.

18:42.198 --> 18:45.164
Is this a shakedown,
Dwayne?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.733
Is that what this is?

18:46.735 --> 18:49.836
Just asking for
a friendly favor is all.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.740
Up to you...
if you accept it or not.

18:53.742 --> 18:56.843
Well, blackmailing
a sitting mayor,

18:56.845 --> 18:59.345
you must really want
to bring this guy down.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.815
More than anything.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.821
(electric gates humming)

19:17.732 --> 19:19.231
(engines starting)

19:25.940 --> 19:28.907
SONJA: Hamilton and Garcia
are on the move, Pride.

19:28.909 --> 19:31.343
Looks like Garcia took the bait.

19:31.345 --> 19:33.112
PRIDE:
Okay, meet me at Patton's van.

19:33.114 --> 19:35.347
I'm parked just across
the street from the OTB.

19:42.722 --> 19:44.822
Showtime.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.144
Garcia's on his way.

20:06.146 --> 20:07.444
(indistinct chatter)

20:07.446 --> 20:09.913
PRIDE:
All right, Loretta, you're up.

20:09.915 --> 20:12.349
It's a crazy-ass plan,
if you ask me.

20:13.786 --> 20:16.287
I'm thinking I like
this undercover stuff.

20:16.289 --> 20:19.223
Maybe I can become
an NCIS agent, too.

20:19.225 --> 20:21.091
You okay?
Yeah.

20:21.093 --> 20:22.326
I got the place
all wired up.

20:22.328 --> 20:24.161
I got control
of everything digital.

20:24.163 --> 20:25.528
Should have wireless
covered soon.

20:25.530 --> 20:27.230
Okay, and if someone
wants to place a bet

20:27.232 --> 20:29.365
on the same race we want
Garcia to bet on?

20:29.367 --> 20:31.301
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got that covered, too.

20:31.303 --> 20:32.869
Nobody loses but Garcia.

20:32.871 --> 20:34.404
Oh, good.

20:34.406 --> 20:35.939
Because Pride said
he'd be here any minute.

20:35.941 --> 20:37.808
Who, Garcia?
Mm-hmm.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.042
No, the plan was
to get Garcia

20:39.044 --> 20:40.510
to bet on the race tomorrow.

20:40.512 --> 20:42.312
It's still the same.
Nothing's changed.

20:43.415 --> 20:45.248
It's just a meet.

20:46.351 --> 20:47.584
Are you sure you're okay?

20:47.586 --> 20:49.652
Yeah, I'm living a dream.

20:49.654 --> 20:51.721
Just make sure they don't
mess up my van.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.159
PRIDE:
How concerned are you?

20:57.161 --> 20:59.061
I'd be less concerned
if he wasn't in denial

20:59.063 --> 21:01.496
about how hard this is for him.

21:02.934 --> 21:06.168
But I'll keep an eye on him.

21:10.474 --> 21:12.507
All right,
here we go.

21:12.509 --> 21:14.042
Garcia just entered.

21:14.044 --> 21:15.444
Get ready.

21:26.189 --> 21:28.724
(sighs)

21:30.360 --> 21:31.826
Is there a problem?

21:31.828 --> 21:34.695
Hard to believe nobody here

21:34.697 --> 21:37.398
is gonna know the race
is already over with.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.501
Yeah, except us...
that's the play.

21:40.503 --> 21:42.603
And the tech wiz behind it
only does it once a month,

21:42.605 --> 21:44.104
so nobody finds out.

21:44.106 --> 21:46.006
How come you found out?

21:46.008 --> 21:48.208
I got him out of trouble once,

21:48.210 --> 21:50.644
and, so, uh, he lets me in on
the action every once in a while

21:50.646 --> 21:52.946
as a way to pay me back.

21:52.948 --> 21:54.547
(chuckles)

21:58.821 --> 22:01.688
Hey, man, I'm doing you a favor;
it's not the other way around.

22:01.690 --> 22:03.190
So, if you don't want to do it,
that's fine,

22:03.192 --> 22:04.391
you know, go ahead, walk.

22:04.393 --> 22:06.293
You can deal with Ortiz
on your own.

22:06.295 --> 22:07.894
You know? God bless.

22:19.308 --> 22:20.873
PRIDE:
Okay, Patton.

22:20.875 --> 22:25.477
Hey, Mr. Mayor, welcome back.

22:25.479 --> 22:27.479
Who's your friend?

22:27.481 --> 22:29.282
We're here to see Hooker.

22:32.821 --> 22:35.454
Follow me.

22:35.456 --> 22:38.424
Remember...

22:38.426 --> 22:41.593
I know a lot about you,
too, Mr. Mayor.

22:41.595 --> 22:45.531
I go down, you go down.

22:48.235 --> 22:50.536
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

22:56.844 --> 22:58.009
Hooker.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.879
We need to talk.

23:07.254 --> 23:08.887
SEBASTIAN:
What are you doing here?

23:08.889 --> 23:10.288
You know we're never
supposed to meet here.

23:10.290 --> 23:13.290
Javier Garcia,
Johnny Hooker.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.992
He wants in.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.261
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.965
I'm talking about blowing
your little scam

23:20.967 --> 23:23.133
unless you do
as I tell you.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.035
He's in, you understand?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.941
How much you thinking?

23:30.943 --> 23:32.309
$2 million.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.979
$2 million?
No, the payout's way too big,

23:34.981 --> 23:35.500
the Gaming Commission'll be...

23:35.524 --> 23:36.867
Ah, don't worry
about the Gaming Commission.

23:36.868 --> 23:39.369
I'll take care of them.
You take care of him.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.340
You're welcome.

23:46.444 --> 23:49.445
All right, look,
come back tomorrow.

23:49.447 --> 23:50.980
Before the fifth
at the Fair Grounds, okay?

23:50.982 --> 23:51.981
That's the race.

23:51.983 --> 23:55.852
First...
I want to find out more.

23:57.756 --> 23:59.856
You're coming with me.

23:59.858 --> 24:01.290
(laughs)

24:01.292 --> 24:02.692
Uh, what are you
talking about?

24:02.694 --> 24:03.892
I'm not going...

24:12.203 --> 24:16.372
Like I said...
you're coming with me.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.608
After you.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.722
Garcia's taking
Sebastian, Pride.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.056
What do you want me to do?

24:35.925 --> 24:37.091
Talk to me, Pride,

24:37.093 --> 24:38.693
do you want me to abort?

24:46.903 --> 24:48.603
No, let it ride.

24:54.043 --> 24:56.210
(sighs)

25:12.241 --> 25:14.175
SEBASTIAN: <i>For the record,</i>
<i>this is called kidnapping.</i>

25:14.177 --> 25:15.709
<i>Okay? And actually, it's...</i>

25:15.711 --> 25:16.844
it's against the law.

25:16.846 --> 25:18.979
So is your scam.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.620
Sleep well, Hooker?

25:26.622 --> 25:28.221
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I always sleep like a baby

25:28.223 --> 25:30.457
when I'm being held
against my will.

25:30.459 --> 25:33.427
Listen, what am I doing here?

25:33.429 --> 25:35.529
If-If you don't want in on this,
that's fine.

25:35.531 --> 25:37.531
I want in.

25:37.533 --> 25:40.334
Just needed to make sure
you weren't setting me up first.

25:43.972 --> 25:48.875
Listen to me very carefully.

25:50.045 --> 25:52.645
I am betting more

25:52.647 --> 25:54.814
than just money on this race.

25:54.816 --> 25:57.817
I am betting my life.

25:57.819 --> 26:00.686
That makes you

26:00.688 --> 26:05.524
my insurance policy, which means
if it doesn't work out

26:05.526 --> 26:09.762
(whispering): exactly the way
you say it will...

26:09.764 --> 26:12.732
you'll be betting
your life, too.

26:14.469 --> 26:17.035
We understand each other?

26:17.838 --> 26:20.372
Yeah, yeah.

26:20.374 --> 26:23.475
Good. Get to work.

26:25.846 --> 26:29.047
Wait, wait, um, you're-you're
still gonna have to go to OTB.

26:29.049 --> 26:31.149
Why?

26:31.151 --> 26:33.818
If I can place the bet
just as easily from here?

26:33.820 --> 26:36.053
Yeah, but not that big a bet,
and-and not at the last second.

26:36.055 --> 26:37.856
Besides...

26:37.858 --> 26:40.725
I mean, how else are you gonna
know that no one else at OTB

26:40.727 --> 26:42.560
knows the race is over,
unless you're actually there

26:42.562 --> 26:44.729
to see that it hasn't
even started yet?

26:47.267 --> 26:48.666
All right.

26:48.668 --> 26:50.067
They're going to watch you

26:50.069 --> 26:52.970
and the race here, live.

26:52.972 --> 26:54.538
As soon as it's over,
call me with the winners.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.073
If it's legit, I'll know.

26:56.075 --> 27:00.244
If it's not...
I'll let you know.

27:14.893 --> 27:17.192
WADE: Dwayne.
Sebastian?

27:17.194 --> 27:19.361
Still at Garcia's according
to Lasalle and Sonja.

27:19.363 --> 27:20.830
All night?

27:20.832 --> 27:22.231
What the hell is
going on over there?

27:22.233 --> 27:23.499
What does Garcia want?

27:23.501 --> 27:25.134
Garcia's desperate, Pride.

27:25.136 --> 27:26.903
He's probably making sure
Sebastian's on the up and up

27:26.905 --> 27:28.603
before he decides
to make that bet.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.571
How do you know?

27:29.573 --> 27:31.073
How do you know Garcia

27:31.075 --> 27:32.374
hasn't already figured out

27:32.376 --> 27:34.476
who Sebastian
really is by now?

27:34.478 --> 27:35.744
I never should've let
Garcia take him.

27:35.746 --> 27:37.146
I don't know what
I was thinking.

27:37.148 --> 27:38.414
You were thinking
you didn't want to blow

27:38.416 --> 27:40.382
your one chance
at taking Garcia down.

27:40.384 --> 27:44.119
Besides, Sebastian could've
easily begged out of this.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.987
He had a chance,
waved Tammy off.

27:45.989 --> 27:47.656
Yeah, why? Why?

27:47.658 --> 27:50.358
Just so-so he could prove
to himself he wasn't afraid?

27:50.360 --> 27:51.526
Prove it to me?

27:51.528 --> 27:53.795
The whole thing
is too damn reckless.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.797
I never should've put him or
anybody else in that position,

27:55.799 --> 27:59.133
not Sebastian, not Patton,
not anybody.

28:00.904 --> 28:04.973
Last time I sent somebody
over to Garcia's place...

28:06.642 --> 28:08.642
...she ended up dead.

28:10.347 --> 28:14.615
Look, Dwayne, first of all,
you didn't ask for our help.

28:14.617 --> 28:17.685
In fact, it was the opposite;
we chose to help.

28:17.687 --> 28:19.353
GREGORIO: Which means we
all knew the risks going in,

28:19.355 --> 28:21.321
even Sebastian.

28:21.323 --> 28:23.023
And Patton, too.

28:23.025 --> 28:26.159
He may be struggling, but he's
still at OTB, still game.

28:26.161 --> 28:29.329
Look, if you want to blame
yourself for anything,

28:29.331 --> 28:31.932
do it for surrounding
yourself with people

28:31.934 --> 28:35.235
who are just as stubborn
and bullheaded as you.

28:35.237 --> 28:36.836
GREGORIO: Besides, you're
not the only one who wants

28:36.838 --> 28:39.272
to make Garcia pay;
we all do. Why?

28:39.274 --> 28:40.807
Because it's the
right thing to do.

28:40.809 --> 28:42.609
That's how you
taught us to roll.

28:43.745 --> 28:46.413
So, are you in or are you out?

28:56.357 --> 28:59.392
Wake up, there he is.

29:00.662 --> 29:01.761
No Sebastian.

29:01.763 --> 29:03.295
No bodyguards, either.

29:03.297 --> 29:05.698
I'll call Pride.

29:06.334 --> 29:08.034
PRIDE:
Yeah?

29:08.036 --> 29:09.368
Garcia's on the move, King.

29:09.370 --> 29:10.536
No sign of Sebastian.

29:10.538 --> 29:11.504
Should we go in?

29:11.506 --> 29:13.239
No, stay put,

29:13.241 --> 29:15.041
but be ready to move in
on my call.

29:15.043 --> 29:18.477
If Garcia places the bet...

29:18.479 --> 29:22.415
as soon as he realizes he's been
had, Sebastian'll be in trouble.

29:24.552 --> 29:26.151
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's a beautiful day</i>

29:26.153 --> 29:28.020
<i>at the Fair Grounds Racetrack</i>
<i>in New Orleans.</i>

29:28.022 --> 29:29.922
Two minutes to post.

29:29.924 --> 29:32.057
The horses are headed
to the gate for the fifth race.

29:32.059 --> 29:35.393
Some of the favorites here
are Alvarado and Lil Lenexa.

29:35.395 --> 29:37.763
Mile and a quarter
for three-year-olds...

29:37.765 --> 29:39.197
Fifth race is up.

29:39.199 --> 29:41.632
Yeah, thank you so much,
that's...

29:49.376 --> 29:51.276
(computer chimes)

29:53.780 --> 29:56.581
Dancing as fast as I can, bro.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.015
Half the field has entered
the starting gate...

29:58.017 --> 29:59.817
Garcia just entered.

30:02.789 --> 30:04.555
Garcia just arrived.

30:04.557 --> 30:05.790
I know, I saw.

30:05.792 --> 30:07.658
I think I got all the delays

30:07.660 --> 30:09.159
in place, wireless, too.

30:09.161 --> 30:11.328
Everybody thinks the
fourth race is still up.

30:11.330 --> 30:12.296
You think?

30:12.298 --> 30:13.397
It'd be easier

30:13.399 --> 30:14.931
if I was hacking
with my equipment

30:14.933 --> 30:16.400
instead of someone else's.

30:16.402 --> 30:17.367
Oh.

30:17.369 --> 30:18.702
You can do this, Patton.

30:18.704 --> 30:20.537
I know you can.

30:20.539 --> 30:23.140
Yeah, well, being around all
this gambling is hard enough,

30:23.142 --> 30:25.442
but rolling the dice
on Sebastian's life

30:25.444 --> 30:26.643
is a whole nother thing.

30:26.645 --> 30:30.379
Just breathe,
we're almost there.

30:31.216 --> 30:33.349
Race is about to start.

30:33.351 --> 30:34.784
Everybody in position?

30:34.786 --> 30:36.219
GREGORIO:
Just give me the word

30:36.221 --> 30:37.787
and I'll take this
son of a bitch down.

30:37.789 --> 30:39.288
PRIDE:
Citizen arrest?

30:39.290 --> 30:40.690
Don't have a badge anymore,
right?

30:40.692 --> 30:42.025
Got to make do.

30:42.027 --> 30:43.760
ANNOUNCER:
All horses are in the gate.

30:43.762 --> 30:45.061
And they're off.

30:45.063 --> 30:48.431
It's Alvarado and Lil Lenexa
fighting for the front.

30:48.433 --> 30:49.432
Alvarado, Lil Lenexa.

30:49.434 --> 30:51.267
Lil Lenexa, Alvarado

30:51.269 --> 30:53.503
looking for a turn,
dueling for the lead.

30:58.676 --> 31:00.510
Here's NOLA Pride,
the long shot,

31:00.512 --> 31:01.544
making his move...

31:01.546 --> 31:02.678
Patton, hey.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.847
Let's review. As soon
as the race finishes,

31:04.849 --> 31:07.449
then Loretta, take the bet,

31:07.451 --> 31:08.851
but the instant

31:08.853 --> 31:10.786
you're sure you got
Garcia's money,

31:10.788 --> 31:11.820
I got to know.

31:11.822 --> 31:13.221
Understood.

31:13.223 --> 31:14.356
Stand by.

31:14.358 --> 31:16.659
Lil Lenexa, NOLA Pride,
Proud Mary moving up.

31:16.661 --> 31:18.861
Lil Lenexa, NOLA Pride,
Alvarado.

31:25.035 --> 31:26.268
They're in the home stretch.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.170
Here comes the long shot,
NOLA Pride,

31:28.172 --> 31:30.272
making his move on the inside.
They're neck and neck.

31:30.274 --> 31:32.707
And it's NOLA Pride by a nose!

31:32.709 --> 31:34.209
Alvarado second
and Proud Mary to show.

31:34.211 --> 31:35.610
Okay, call your boss right now.

31:35.612 --> 31:36.878
Go, go, go.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.081
NOLA Pride with a
breathtaking victory by an inch.

31:40.083 --> 31:43.885
Alvarado is second,
Proud Mary a closing third.

31:51.260 --> 31:52.826
Two minutes to post.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.761
The horses are headed to
the gate for the fifth race.

31:54.763 --> 31:58.031
Some of the favorites here
are Alvarado and Lil Lenexa.

31:58.033 --> 32:00.033
(cell phone ringing)

32:00.035 --> 32:02.469
Mile and a quarter
for three-year-olds Trifecta...

32:02.471 --> 32:03.604
(continues indistinctly)

32:03.606 --> 32:04.672
NOLA Pride,

32:04.674 --> 32:06.240
Alvarado, Proud Mary.

32:06.242 --> 32:08.041
You're sure?

32:08.043 --> 32:10.010
Okay.
(clears throat)

32:10.012 --> 32:13.246
But, hey, don't let Hooker out
of your sight, understand?

32:14.149 --> 32:16.249
BODYGUARD:
You got it, boss.

32:19.521 --> 32:22.122
(alert noise)

32:22.124 --> 32:23.690
(card slides, then alert noise)

32:23.692 --> 32:26.526
(alert noise)

32:26.528 --> 32:29.061
Problem, sir?

32:29.063 --> 32:30.663
Problem? (chuckles)
Yeah.

32:30.665 --> 32:32.398
I'm-I'm trying to bet
$2 million on-on race five,

32:32.400 --> 32:33.899
but it won't let me.

32:33.901 --> 32:37.604
Oh, $2 million, no wonder,
that's over our limit.

32:37.606 --> 32:39.606
Get me your supervisor.

32:39.608 --> 32:40.873
Now.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.342
Wait here, please.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.948
The last horse is entering
the starting gate.

32:50.584 --> 32:53.018
$2 million?

32:53.020 --> 32:55.354
That's a lot of change.

32:55.356 --> 32:57.189
How do we know it's legit?

32:57.925 --> 33:00.892
I can wire it to you directly.

33:00.894 --> 33:02.694
You got a routing number?

33:10.904 --> 33:12.638
Here.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.773
Hurry.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.742
NOLA Pride win,
Alvarado place, Proud Mary show.

33:17.744 --> 33:19.343
In that order.

33:23.984 --> 33:25.416
Got it all, Pride.

33:25.418 --> 33:26.751
Pride?

33:26.753 --> 33:29.020
Christopher, Sonja, go now.

33:29.022 --> 33:31.855
Why did you say "Pride"?

33:32.759 --> 33:35.359
The horses are in the gates,
and...

33:37.163 --> 33:40.498
First NOLA Pride,
second Alvarado,

33:40.500 --> 33:42.433
third Proud Mary.

33:42.435 --> 33:43.834
Again, first NOLA Pride...

33:43.836 --> 33:45.369
What?

33:45.371 --> 33:47.538
What is going on?

33:47.540 --> 33:48.872
PATTON:
What's going on is the FBI

33:48.874 --> 33:50.340
has your money now.

33:50.342 --> 33:51.741
Which means

33:51.743 --> 33:53.310
you're bankrupt, Garcia.

33:56.916 --> 33:58.916
(gun cocks)
GREGORIO: Don't do it or I'll shoot.

34:10.161 --> 34:11.594
(Sonja yells)

34:13.130 --> 34:15.297
Sebastian.
Hey, guys.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.500
Uh... I may not be
good with a gun,

34:17.502 --> 34:19.502
but I am awesome at golf.

34:19.504 --> 34:21.570
Check that out.

34:21.572 --> 34:23.873
That there would be
the bad guys.

34:26.244 --> 34:27.643
You're under arrest.
(handcuffs click)

34:27.645 --> 34:29.846
Citizen's arrest, maybe,
but same thing.

34:32.951 --> 34:36.018
This is entrapment.

34:36.020 --> 34:37.553
It'll never
stand up in court.

34:37.554 --> 34:39.455
I don't think Pablo Ortiz
is gonna give you

34:39.456 --> 34:40.889
time for court, do you?

34:42.592 --> 34:47.094
I told you I wouldn't let you
get away with this.

35:07.881 --> 35:09.881
Thanks, Roy.

35:09.883 --> 35:12.350
(Isler chuckles)

35:12.352 --> 35:16.153
I was halfway to the airport
when I got your call, but...

35:16.155 --> 35:18.856
I wasn't even sure
if it was even true.

35:18.858 --> 35:20.458
Where'd you think
the $2 million came from?

35:20.460 --> 35:21.793
(laughs)

35:21.795 --> 35:22.960
I didn't know.

35:22.962 --> 35:24.696
Still not sure.

35:24.698 --> 35:27.565
Did I get it legally?

35:27.567 --> 35:30.368
No.
Debatable.

35:30.370 --> 35:32.870
Lucky for FBI,

35:32.872 --> 35:35.306
Garcia's waived his rights,
he wants to confess.

35:35.308 --> 35:37.074
Confess to what?

35:37.076 --> 35:38.608
Everything.

35:38.610 --> 35:41.278
Cartel embeds, drug smuggling,
money laundering,

35:41.280 --> 35:43.314
how he used the West family
to do it.

35:43.316 --> 35:45.883
Killing my agents?
Killing Eliza, too.

35:47.119 --> 35:48.452
Like I said...

35:50.756 --> 35:52.756
everything.

35:52.758 --> 35:55.759
So is this true?

35:55.761 --> 35:58.261
On one condition.

35:58.263 --> 35:59.896
There's always conditions.

35:59.898 --> 36:01.631
Yeah, just for the record,
I'm against it.

36:01.633 --> 36:02.932
I just want him
in prison.

36:02.934 --> 36:04.200
I won't last a week

36:04.202 --> 36:06.903
in prison;
where Ortiz can get to me?

36:06.905 --> 36:08.972
No deal, no confession.

36:08.974 --> 36:12.108
Well, I'm listening.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.677
I can give you names,

36:14.679 --> 36:18.714
important names,
I wasn't acting alone.

36:18.716 --> 36:20.016
Cops,

36:20.018 --> 36:22.551
judges, politicians.

36:22.553 --> 36:25.821
Bribes go a long way

36:25.823 --> 36:27.690
in this town.
What names?

36:27.692 --> 36:29.992
Put me in Witness Protection,
I'll give them to you.

36:29.994 --> 36:32.060
Witness Protection,
are you kidding me?

36:32.062 --> 36:33.996
You're a murderer,
you don't...

36:35.132 --> 36:37.432
you don't get a life!

36:37.434 --> 36:38.833
ISLER:
Humor me.

36:38.835 --> 36:40.302
Give me one name.

36:40.304 --> 36:43.605
(scoffs)

36:44.674 --> 36:47.675
Mayor Hamilton.

36:58.221 --> 37:00.288
ISLER: Just got off the phone
with the attorney's office.

37:00.290 --> 37:04.158
Said WITSEC's fine
as long as the names pan out.

37:04.160 --> 37:07.061
After everything Garcia's done,

37:07.063 --> 37:10.264
he's gonna get to live out
the rest of his life Scot-free.

37:10.266 --> 37:12.199
I can't believe we went
through all this for that.

37:12.201 --> 37:13.267
What's he get?

37:13.269 --> 37:16.003
$2,000 a month
for food and rent?

37:16.005 --> 37:17.371
A job at a convenience store?

37:17.373 --> 37:18.572
Garcia's life is ruined.

37:18.574 --> 37:20.141
And not like it'd
be in prison,

37:20.143 --> 37:21.675
which is what he deserves.

37:21.677 --> 37:22.944
I agree.

37:22.946 --> 37:26.314
But now we get more.
(car engine starts)

37:26.316 --> 37:28.649
You get more,

37:28.651 --> 37:30.150
starting with
Mayor Hamilton.

37:30.152 --> 37:31.685
Off the record?

37:31.687 --> 37:33.821
D.C.'s been concerned
about it for a while now,

37:33.823 --> 37:37.691
even considered taking federal
control over law enforcement

37:37.693 --> 37:39.192
to clean it up.

37:39.194 --> 37:42.295
But in success,

37:42.297 --> 37:44.998
this could get D.C.
out of your hair for good.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.467
I can't say I don't like
the sound of that.

37:47.469 --> 37:49.669
Yeah, I thought you would.

37:52.874 --> 37:55.208
Do I have your support?

37:56.845 --> 37:59.346
(softly):
Yeah.

37:59.348 --> 38:00.680
Took us long enough,

38:00.682 --> 38:03.749
but we finally agree
on something, huh?

38:03.751 --> 38:07.887
Still, despite the few...
disagreements,

38:07.889 --> 38:11.891
it's been a real pleasure,
Agent Pride.

38:11.893 --> 38:13.693
Likewise.

38:16.464 --> 38:20.966
I am going back to D.C. with
a very big win, thanks to you.

38:20.968 --> 38:25.004
If there's ever anything
I can do, you let me know.

38:25.006 --> 38:27.206
Actually...

38:28.209 --> 38:30.309
there is one thing.

38:39.953 --> 38:41.586
You wanted to see me?

38:41.588 --> 38:43.855
Yeah.

38:43.857 --> 38:45.456
So, uh...

38:45.458 --> 38:46.825
what's this I hear
about Garcia?

38:46.827 --> 38:48.860
What about him?

38:48.862 --> 38:51.029
Don't be coy with me.

38:51.031 --> 38:52.830
Don't do it.

38:52.832 --> 38:54.932
'Cause I know you know.

38:54.934 --> 38:57.768
I figured the FBI would
lock him up, why WITSEC?

38:57.770 --> 39:01.072
Curious how you heard.

39:01.074 --> 39:04.208
It-It makes no difference
how I heard, I just did.

39:04.210 --> 39:06.510
I'm just trying to figure out
what the hell's going on,

39:06.512 --> 39:09.146
and why this scum
rates protection.

39:09.148 --> 39:12.282
Must have something
valuable to offer.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.151
Well, obviously he does.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.387
So what is it,
all right?

39:17.389 --> 39:19.023
You got to know,
you got to know,

39:19.025 --> 39:20.958
you're the one that
brought him in.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.694
Let's just say,
I think it's valuable, too.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.164
So you're not
gonna tell me, huh?

39:27.166 --> 39:28.932
All right.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.668
I helped you get Garcia.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.537
And if it wasn't for me,

39:33.539 --> 39:36.406
you'd still be crying about how
he got away with Eliza's murder,

39:36.408 --> 39:38.341
so you owe me, Dwayne.

39:38.343 --> 39:43.512
Trust me, Mr. Mayor,

39:43.514 --> 39:48.184
you're gonna
find out soon enough.

40:23.887 --> 40:26.121
Oh, free drinks and
Earl St. Clair on the stage?

40:26.123 --> 40:28.889
It doesn't get any
better than that.

40:28.891 --> 40:30.492
Whoa!
Uh, that's my Sazerac.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.293
All right, all right,
relax, relax,

40:32.295 --> 40:34.295
I'm drinking
mineral water anyway.

40:34.297 --> 40:35.630
You?

40:35.632 --> 40:37.532
Out of all the people
and what you did,

40:37.534 --> 40:38.899
you should be celebrating,
Tiger Woods.

40:38.901 --> 40:40.368
I'll drink to that.

40:40.370 --> 40:42.970
Well, I am celebrating, by
getting on the early flight

40:42.972 --> 40:44.606
tomorrow morning
to Georgia.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.674
FLETC?
That's right.

40:46.676 --> 40:48.175
Oh, you're actually
going through it.

40:48.177 --> 40:50.044
NCIS training.
(all cheer)

40:50.046 --> 40:52.479
SONJA: Finally, the team
will be complete.

40:52.481 --> 40:54.115
Well, I still got
to pass, obviously.

40:54.117 --> 40:56.283
I also have to learn how to
shoot a gun without freezing.

40:56.285 --> 40:57.852
Bygones. Congrats.

40:57.854 --> 40:59.086
Thanks, guys...

40:59.088 --> 41:00.254
PATTON:
Hey, wait, wait, hold up,

41:00.256 --> 41:01.455
I know y'all
didn't just toast

41:01.457 --> 41:03.990
without Triple P.
PRIDE: You kidding?

41:03.992 --> 41:06.693
The ringleader of the sting?
No way.

41:06.695 --> 41:09.696
In fact...

41:09.698 --> 41:12.432
we've been waiting on you.
Waiting for what?

41:12.434 --> 41:15.602
WADE: Happy birthday!
(laughter and cheering)

41:15.604 --> 41:17.737
Oh!
You did it.

41:17.739 --> 41:19.505
Barely, but I'll take it.
(laughs)

41:19.507 --> 41:20.840
SONJA:
Yeah!

41:20.842 --> 41:22.341
(laughter)

41:22.343 --> 41:24.778
SONJA: How about you, Tammy?
What you gonna do?

41:24.780 --> 41:26.279
You going back to D.C., too?

41:27.582 --> 41:29.248
No, I'm gonna stay.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.484
There's nothing there
for me anymore anyway.

41:31.486 --> 41:33.619
Hey, Pride, maybe you need
a good bartender.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.054
I'm kind of a vet now, right?

41:35.056 --> 41:37.190
Uh... sorry.

41:37.192 --> 41:39.659
But I might have
another job for you.

41:45.333 --> 41:50.670
Isler got DoD to authorize
another agent for the team.

41:50.672 --> 41:52.404
Could use an extra hand.

41:52.406 --> 41:54.606
You interested?

41:54.608 --> 41:57.375
I don't know what to say.

41:57.377 --> 41:59.344
You say yes, idiot.

41:59.346 --> 42:02.147
Come on.
(phone rings)

42:02.149 --> 42:04.750
SONJA: Yes!
(chuckles) Pride.

42:09.590 --> 42:13.958
Thanks for telling me.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.793
Something wrong?

42:17.831 --> 42:19.831
Car bomb.

42:19.833 --> 42:23.235
Just killed Garcia,
mid-transport.

42:23.237 --> 42:26.104
Well, it had to be
the cartel, right?

42:26.106 --> 42:29.006
I mean, who else would know
FBI even had him?
