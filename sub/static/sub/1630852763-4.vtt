WEBVTT

01:37.515 --> 01:38.766
Finlay.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.392
Any luck tracking down Spivey?

01:40.476 --> 01:42.394
Dead end. You?

01:42.478 --> 01:44.897
<i>Well, found out Hubble's
been lying to his wife.</i>

01:44.897 --> 01:46.565
Hasn't worked at the bank
in a year.

01:46.649 --> 01:47.858
Guess we could throw that

01:47.942 --> 01:49.735
onto the "What the Heck
Does That Mean" file.

01:49.819 --> 01:50.986
Anything else?

01:51.070 --> 01:53.030
Potential lead
on your brother's rental car.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.241
<i>A driver called in
a burnt-out vehicle</i>

01:55.241 --> 01:57.993
<i>a few hundred yards
west of mile marker 97,</i>

01:58.077 --> 01:59.328
off of Rural Route 9.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.496
On my way.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.872
Who else knows about it?

02:01.956 --> 02:03.457
Only those who need to.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.684
Time to stop for a snack, I see.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.769
Worked up an appetite.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.771
It was on the way.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.065
- No, thanks.
- Missing out.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.359
Yeah, on heart disease.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.778
Farmer chasing down
one of his pigs found it.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.363
Roscoe told Teale
the plates matched

02:34.363 --> 02:37.199
one of Morrison's old collars
to throw him off the scent.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.577
There are no plates.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.078
Yup.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.706
Someone took pains to hide it
from the road with brush,

02:43.706 --> 02:45.833
but last night's rain
washed away the cover.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.793
Joe would have wanted an SUV
for headroom.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.712
Still doesn't mean
it was your brother's.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.130
We're in Big Car Country.
Could be stolen.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.257
Would've been reported missing
by now.

03:00.222 --> 03:03.017
Fire didn't start in the engine
or the gas tank.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.103
Burn's darkest in the center,
then spreads out.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.479
Accelerant and a match.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.614
It's Roscoe.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.283
Hey.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.328
What are we looking at?

03:22.328 --> 03:24.288
This Joe's car or what?

03:24.288 --> 03:27.416
Think so.
Can't be 100%.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.672
Charred pretty bad.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.300
Might be able to get
a partial VIN.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.140
We can send photos to forensics.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.225
Old army trick.

03:47.519 --> 03:51.065
When you run out of gun oil,
acetic acid from ketchup

03:51.065 --> 03:55.110
and salt for abrasion
make a great metal cleaner.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.161
And you put that in your body.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.830
Tastes good.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.709
All right,
I'll get Picard to run the VIN.

04:10.793 --> 04:14.088
A Fed'll get faster results
than a detective from nowhere.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.423
How'd it go at the Blue Cat?

04:16.507 --> 04:18.467
South Americans got to Spivey
before I did.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.387
- Found him stashed in their trunk.
- Shit.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.014
Well, you told me you had
a dead end, not a dead body.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.182
We got to find these guys

04:25.182 --> 04:26.809
before they kill
any more of our leads.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.894
I know where you can find
the South Americans,

04:28.978 --> 04:31.355
- but they won't talk.
- Why not? I'm a good interrogator.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.982
Not <i>that</i> good.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.820
Seven.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.114
Seven bodies
since you set foot in my town.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.992
They charged me
and they were armed.

04:42.992 --> 04:46.203
- Fine. I get it.
- The real number's eight. Hubble's dead, too.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.123
- We just haven't found him yet.
- You're either not talking

04:49.123 --> 04:51.250
or saying the exact thing
to piss me off.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.584
Okay, what matters is

04:52.668 --> 04:53.961
we lost the chance
of figuring out

04:53.961 --> 04:55.963
who sent
the South Americans here.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.881
Where the hell are you going?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.883
- Get rid of those bodies.
- They're evidence.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.802
- We don't destroy evidence.
- Those bodies get found,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.054
we'll be flooded
with state cops, county cops.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.723
We don't know who we can trust.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.349
We need to keep them hidden

05:07.433 --> 05:08.851
until we find out
who killed Joe

05:08.851 --> 05:11.353
so we can keep
this investigation between us.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.356
I know.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.650
I'll keep an eye on him.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.659
Oh, my God. His legs.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.123
I did that after.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.209
It's like Tetris.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.801
That's an exit wound.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.012
You shot them in the back.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.057
You just told Finlay
they charged you.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.683
I told Finlay
what he needed to hear.

05:49.767 --> 05:50.809
This isn't the movies.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.644
I had a chance to kill them
and I did.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.402
What happened in Baghdad?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.363
You've been talking to KJ.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.117
No. He's been talking to me.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.036
But don't change the subject.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.454
If we're gonna see
this thing through,

06:10.454 --> 06:12.498
I need to know what kind
of person I'm working with.

06:12.498 --> 06:16.460
So what happened in Baghdad,
Reacher?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.424
It wasn't Baghdad.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.177
<i>It was a small village
40 klicks north.</i>

06:25.177 --> 06:27.387
<i>I was tracking an AWOL PFC.</i>

06:27.471 --> 06:30.057
<i>Group of boys--
ten, 11 years old--</i>

06:30.057 --> 06:33.018
<i>played soccer in
a bombed-out hangar every day.</i>

06:34.895 --> 06:36.688
<i>Whenever they'd see me,
they'd wave.</i>

06:36.772 --> 06:38.941
<i>I waved back.</i>

06:38.941 --> 06:41.610
One night it got real late.
They hadn't returned.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.612
<i>Between insurgents and IEDs,</i>

06:43.612 --> 06:45.614
<i>I wanted to make sure
they got home safe.</i>

06:45.614 --> 06:47.825
[boy cries, grunts] <i>- I went back to the hangars</i>

06:47.825 --> 06:50.786
<i>- so they wouldn't have to walk back alone.</i>

06:50.786 --> 06:53.330
Three men from the village
were abusing the boys.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.457
You can fill in the blanks.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.584
I sent the kids away,

06:57.668 --> 06:59.878
but stayed
to give the adults a choice.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.005
They could turn themselves in
to Iraqi police

07:02.089 --> 07:03.674
or they'd answer to me.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.594
<i>I knew they'd come for me...</i>

07:09.638 --> 07:11.348
<i>...so when they did,</i>

07:11.348 --> 07:13.058
<i>I was ready.</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:24.903
How did KJ know about this?

07:24.987 --> 07:26.238
Kliners have money.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.365
Money buys access
and information.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.703
So... you have a problem

07:32.703 --> 07:35.080
with me killing people
who hurt children?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.877
'Cause I want to know the kind
of person I'm working with.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.799
No.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.012
I guess I don't.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.680
Good.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.184
Now, let's get to the airport
and dump these bodies.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.623
Oh, fuck's sakes.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.002
Oh, fuck.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.846
Done.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.974
What?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.936
Nothing.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.230
Just...

10:05.314 --> 10:07.733
when I asked Mosley what kind
of business Kliner was in,

10:07.733 --> 10:10.694
he said trucking,
real estate, chemicals.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.280
Know what he didn't say?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.906
Agriculture.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.534
I already told you, a delivery
like that's pretty normal

10:17.534 --> 10:19.745
for these parts.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.830
Still...

10:21.830 --> 10:24.750
it was a hell of a lot
of animal feed.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.510
- Is this really necessary?
- Lots of Jags in this city,

10:35.594 --> 10:38.221
but only one
with plates we'll recognize.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.909
We need a room.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.869
From floors three to seven,
if you have it.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.871
- King or two queens?
- Two queens.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.169
Only two-queen I have left
is a suite.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.047
Not a problem.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.841
Oh. Okay, then.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.510
I just need to see
some form of ID.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.471
Put it under Officer Welty,
first name Eudora.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.139
E-U-D-O-R-A.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.438
Where'd you get all that cash?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.649
From our friends in the trunk.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.943
Apparently, people get paid
a lot to kill me.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.444
If those guys were working
for counterfeiters,

11:34.528 --> 11:36.613
you just paid for our room
with counterfeit cash.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.698
Not my problem.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.329
Eudora Welty?

11:44.413 --> 11:45.705
Fan of her writing?

11:45.789 --> 11:47.457
I'm surprised
you've heard of her.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.876
I like short stories.
They get right to the point.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.254
- No nonsense.
- My guess is Welty is your go-to,

11:52.254 --> 11:54.297
but when you travel,
it's Margaret Mitchell.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.425
Her prose is too long-winded
for you, but...

11:56.425 --> 11:58.343
Georgia born and bred.
Got to represent.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.429
What, do you moonlight
for the psychic phone network?

12:00.429 --> 12:02.639
You can tell a lot about
a person by their pseudonyms.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.766
Take from it what you will,
but I like

12:04.850 --> 12:06.852
forgotten vice presidents
and Yankees second basemen.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.104
Oh. If I'd known that,
I would have checked us in

12:09.104 --> 12:11.022
under Willie Randolph.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.870
Early a.m., we go
to Pete Jobling's address.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.997
Talk to his wife.
See if we can suss out

12:26.997 --> 12:29.624
why whoever killed Jobling
wanted my brother dead, too.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.418
Sounds like a good plan.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.926
- What are you doing?
- Buying time.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.095
In the unlikely event
someone tracks us here,

12:42.179 --> 12:44.222
this won't keep them out,
but it'll slow them down.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.850
Give me a few extra seconds
to get my shot off.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.733
What if the maid busts in?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.985
She'd be a very strong maid.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.659
You know we're
on the seventh floor?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.786
No one's got the wingspan to
reach that window, not even you.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.788
I know half a dozen
sharpshooters

13:08.872 --> 13:11.374
that could take us out
on the 15th floor.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.753
Don't sleep with your head where
it's expected to be, either.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.473
Molly Beth. <i>- Uh, sorry for calling so late.</i>

13:26.473 --> 13:27.974
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

13:28.058 --> 13:29.851
No, I figured you'd call.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.103
<i>I, um, I tracked down</i>

13:32.187 --> 13:34.231
a lot of Joe's files
pertaining to this case.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.566
I-I don't know
if it's everything, but it's...

13:36.650 --> 13:37.817
voluminous.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.862
<i>I'll have it copied and collated
by the morning.</i>

13:40.946 --> 13:42.864
My flight lands at ATL
at 5:00 p.m.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.157
Can't meet you there.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.325
Too many cameras at the airport.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.035
You're breaking at least
four laws I can think of

13:47.035 --> 13:49.037
handing us those files--
we don't want any record

13:49.037 --> 13:51.498
- of this happening.
- Molly Beth, take the train to Five Points station.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.083
No real security there.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.044
<i>I look forward
to finally meeting you.</i>

13:56.044 --> 14:00.298
Not under these circumstances,
of course. It's just...

14:00.382 --> 14:02.592
Joe told me so much about you.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.012
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hey.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.514
Hold on a minute.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.099
You're having this woman
fly across the country

14:09.099 --> 14:10.684
and deliver papers
she could have just shipped.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.061
You want to meet her
just as much as she does you

14:13.061 --> 14:14.229
to talk about Joe,

14:14.229 --> 14:16.523
so... why wait?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.941
Just talk.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.243
Hi. Uh...

14:29.327 --> 14:31.788
You two must have been close
if you let him bore you

14:31.788 --> 14:33.206
with stories about me.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.085
How long did you work together?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.130
Uh, I started two years ago,

14:40.130 --> 14:43.383
but Joe had already been there
a while at that point.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.387
<i>Already made a name for himself.</i>

14:47.387 --> 14:49.347
Top to bottom,
everyone respected him.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.600
A real lead-by-example
kind of guy, you know?

14:53.310 --> 14:55.061
Yeah, I do.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.398
<i>He'd go on
about how smart you are.</i>

14:58.398 --> 15:01.776
Maybe too smart for
your own good, he'd say, and...

15:01.860 --> 15:05.071
a pain in his ass sometimes.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.868
<i>But he said you were a good man</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.911
and that even though you were
his little brother,

15:11.995 --> 15:14.497
he was the one
who looked up to you.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.500
Yeah, for me it was
the other way around.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.881
He was the only man
I ever felt small next to.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.675
I'm glad he found you,
Molly Beth.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.886
My brother was a very particular
kind of person.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.975
He didn't take to people easily,
so you must be special.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.311
He must have cared
about you very much.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.688
I, um...

15:38.772 --> 15:41.191
I cared about him, too.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.402
Very much.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.906
Uh, I should get back to work.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.867
Um, I will see you tomorrow.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.829
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.170
You okay?

16:03.254 --> 16:05.674
I'm fine.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.397
Losing family's
a special kind of pain.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.486
When my parents died, I was
old enough to remember all of it

16:26.486 --> 16:30.907
and young enough
to understand none of it.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.661
You're hurting,

16:34.661 --> 16:37.372
and you still
tried to comfort Molly Beth.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.715
Joe's right.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.926
You're a good man.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.561
I'm gonna shower.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.525
We didn't order room service
and we don't need housekeeping.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.445
If anybody tries
to come through that door...

17:08.445 --> 17:10.572
shoot 'em.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.624
<i>Let me down ea... ♪</i>

17:21.708 --> 17:23.710
<i>Easy, baby ♪</i>

17:52.781 --> 17:55.658

18:02.499 --> 18:05.335

18:16.221 --> 18:19.349
So, uh, we might get some
pushback from Jobling's wife.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.100
Husband's murdered, no leads--

18:21.184 --> 18:23.269
she's not gonna be
liking cops too much.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.729
Got it.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.022
I'll talk.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.941
Okay.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.073
Hey, um...

18:36.699 --> 18:38.493
So, about last night--

18:38.493 --> 18:41.204
as far as I'm concerned,
it changes nothing.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.290
We've got a job to do.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.251
Okay.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.015
Morning, ma'am.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.642
Is this
Pete Jobling's residence?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.143
It is. May I help you?

19:04.227 --> 19:05.436
We're the police, ma'am.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.313
Officers Welty and Randolph.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.566
We'd like to talk to you
about Pete.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.775
Something wrong?

19:10.859 --> 19:12.277
We'd just like to speak
for a moment.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.487
We can do it outside if that
makes you more comfortable.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.198
Uh, no, I... I guess
it's okay to come inside.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.325
Pete's back in the kitchen.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.997
Some police officers

19:23.997 --> 19:26.249
say they need to speak
with you, Pete.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.961
Everything okay?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.381
You're Pete Senior.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.633
You're looking for our son.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.634
Is Petey okay?

19:36.718 --> 19:38.720
- Well...
- He's fine, ma'am.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.180
Uh, there was a string
of hijackings recently

19:41.264 --> 19:42.432
at his trucking company.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.766
He wasn't involved,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.102
but we want to ask him
some questions,

19:46.102 --> 19:48.813
see if maybe he can help us
at all with our investigation.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.232
Thank goodness.
You had me scared.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.401
This happens sometimes,
you know.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.320
People getting
my Petes confused.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.614
But Junior hasn't lived with us
for a while now.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.782
He's over in Brookhaven
with his wife, Judy.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.534
Here's his address.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.370
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.044
Why'd you lie?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.629
They would've gotten emotional.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.714
- We don't have the time.
- Oh.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.216
Thought maybe after
Charlie Hubble and Molly Beth,

20:17.300 --> 20:19.677
you needed a breather
from breaking bad news.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.180
We don't have the time.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.731
You wanted to see me, sir?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.149
Captain, come in.

20:37.195 --> 20:40.573
Don't bother. This'll be brief.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.450
Word's going around town

20:42.450 --> 20:44.202
you've been harassing
Mr. Kliner.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.829
I was investigating
the Morrison murders

20:46.913 --> 20:48.414
like you directed me to.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.583
He says you threatened
to put a part of your anatomy

20:50.667 --> 20:52.585
up into a part of his anatomy.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.213
Something about your foot
and his ass.

20:55.213 --> 20:59.050
Things, regrettably,
turned acrimonious.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.094
- Not my best moment.
- Let me make things

21:01.094 --> 21:02.845
crystal clear for you.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.140
Kliner is one of Margrave's
most important citizens,

21:06.224 --> 21:08.893
and as such,
we treat him and his family

21:08.977 --> 21:10.728
with due respect.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.731
That rule is as hard

21:13.815 --> 21:15.858
as the tip of my walking stick.
You understand?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.069
Completely.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.157
He suggested I consider
removing you from your job.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.784
Which is ironic, seeing how

21:24.784 --> 21:26.911
his donations to our force
allowed us to match

21:26.995 --> 21:28.830
your bloated
New England salary demands

21:28.830 --> 21:32.375
- when we hired you.
- And I'm appreciative of that, sir.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.876
Then show it.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.505
That file
contains the rap sheets

21:37.505 --> 21:39.799
of a dozen ex-cons
who had a beef with Morrison.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.760
Now, I got a town
full of anxious voters

21:42.844 --> 21:44.387
waiting for me to restore order.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.764
Do a deep dive
into those papers.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.559
Find who killed
our brother-in-arms.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.352
And maybe we can see

21:51.436 --> 21:53.438
if that inflated paycheck
of yours

21:53.438 --> 21:56.607
can be pumped up
a little bit more.

21:56.691 --> 21:57.817
We on track?

21:58.860 --> 22:00.570
All four wheels.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.406
And this last bit
I'm gonna spell out for you

22:03.406 --> 22:05.491
like we're in kindergarten.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.910
You're not to do
a single goddamn thing

22:07.994 --> 22:10.329
on this matter
without my approval first.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.707
One step out of line,
you're off the case.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.460
Two steps, you lose your career.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.130
Stick or carrot.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.883
Choice is yours.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.761
Excuse the interruption, Chief.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.179
Finlay,
your father's on the line.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.430
Says it's urgent.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.771
Do I have your permission
to take this call?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.272
Don't fuck with me.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.247
Hey, Pops. <i>- Hey.</i>

22:53.331 --> 22:55.416
<i>Uh, I got that recipe
you asked about.</i>

22:55.500 --> 22:56.918
But I can't read
some of the ingredients,

22:56.918 --> 22:58.961
so I'd prefer
to just give you a copy.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.089
Much as I like to see you, Dad,

23:01.089 --> 23:03.257
I can't leave right now.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.634
But I have some friends
in the area.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.010
Then send 'em on over
to pick it up.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.055
- - <i>2
- S, 3
- W from my place in an hour.</i>

23:09.055 --> 23:11.474
And what about Mama?
And my little sisters?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.434
They're doing okay.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.061
<i>That's what I like to hear.</i>

23:15.061 --> 23:16.604
Talk soon.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.106
All right.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.694
Just got off the phone
with Captain Finlay.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.238
Is everything okay? Any news?

23:25.238 --> 23:26.989
Nothing you need to worry about.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.617
But I do need to go and relay
some sensitive information

23:29.617 --> 23:31.369
about the investigation.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.162
In person.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.417
Is someone coming
to relieve you?

23:38.501 --> 23:40.711
We can't let any more people
into the fold.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.922
But I'll only be gone
a few hours.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.009
It's okay.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.720
No one knows you're here.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.352
I'm not supposed to do this,
but...

23:57.395 --> 23:59.063
Do you know how to use this?

23:59.147 --> 24:01.607
My father took me to the range.

24:01.691 --> 24:05.486
If the need arises,
do not hesitate to use it.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.656
Hesitation will get you killed.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.502
Uh, cream, sugar?

24:21.586 --> 24:23.129
Uh, black.
For both of us, please.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.338
There you go.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.345
So...

24:31.429 --> 24:33.639
Regarding your husband...

24:33.723 --> 24:34.891
He's dead, isn't he?

24:34.891 --> 24:36.642
Yes.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.478
Yes, he is.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.563
I'm not.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.649
Okay. That's not the reaction

24:43.733 --> 24:46.110
- that we were expecting, Mrs. Jobling.
- Miller.

24:46.194 --> 24:47.778
I didn't take his name.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.197
Ms. Miller.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.324
Why don't you care
that your husband's dead?

24:51.324 --> 24:53.409
It's not that I don't care.
I'm just not sorry.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.203
I warned him over and over

24:55.203 --> 24:56.495
that it was gonna catch up
to him.

24:56.579 --> 24:57.955
- What was?
- You know

24:58.039 --> 24:59.498
any other truck drivers
with a place like this?

24:59.582 --> 25:01.584
Who can pay off
their parents' mortgage?

25:04.503 --> 25:05.838
You ever say anything?

25:05.922 --> 25:07.089
When I want to.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.883
So, you suspected

25:08.883 --> 25:10.092
that your husband was engaged

25:10.176 --> 25:12.178
- in illegal activity?
- Yeah.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.846
He was stealing
from his company. From Kliner.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.807
He was hauling air conditioners
for them down to Miami.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.267
Now, he never admitted this,

25:18.351 --> 25:19.727
but with the money
he was pulling in,

25:19.727 --> 25:21.604
something tells me not
all those AC units were getting

25:21.604 --> 25:23.189
where they were supposed to go.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.316
Knew he'd piss off
the wrong person eventually.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.485
That wrong person
shot your husband from behind,

25:27.485 --> 25:29.570
left him to die in a field.

25:30.571 --> 25:34.242
- Now you speak to say something like that?
- Yes.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.952
Someone I care about
was killed, too.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.746
So if you have anything
to share,

25:38.746 --> 25:40.790
share it now.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.047
I can show you the boxes.

25:52.343 --> 25:53.928
From his work.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.805
I assume he took the units,

25:55.805 --> 25:57.390
reboxed 'em,
sold 'em on the black market.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.641
It was always boxes

25:58.641 --> 26:00.226
coming in and out of here.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.269
It's amazing
what you'll tolerate

26:01.269 --> 26:02.687
when a guy can throw a good hump
into you.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.985
The night Pete was killed,
you had no idea who he was going

26:08.985 --> 26:11.279
- to meet?
- No. He was always getting calls at all hours,

26:11.279 --> 26:13.281
running out,
not coming home for days.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.573
At first I'd ask,

26:14.657 --> 26:16.242
and that just led
to more fighting.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.910
That why you didn't
report him missing?

26:17.994 --> 26:20.788
That and I just
stopped giving a shit.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.249
Woman can only
take so much, right?

26:23.249 --> 26:25.376
You can bury his ass in
potter's field for all I care.

26:25.376 --> 26:26.961
I'm flying out of here

26:26.961 --> 26:28.296
first thing tomorrow.
I'm gonna stay with my folks

26:28.296 --> 26:29.630
till I can sell this place.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.090
I'm done with Georgia,

26:31.090 --> 26:32.800
and I'm done with that asshole.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.306
Finlay.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.726
2S, 3W. Got it.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.269
On our way.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.687
We need to go.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.731
You need to change
out of that uniform.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.612
Jobling would have to move

26:53.696 --> 26:56.157
more ACs than General Electric
to afford those two houses.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.993
Only thing he cared about moving
was fake cash for Kliner.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.578
Molly Beth said your brother
shut down counterfeiting

27:00.578 --> 27:02.288
- on U.S. soil.
- Bills are produced

27:02.288 --> 27:03.622
in South America
by whoever employed

27:03.706 --> 27:05.124
the guys we left
in long-term parking.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.417
Money's shipped to Florida.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.127
Jobling drives down
with real air conditioners

27:08.127 --> 27:10.546
to keep up appearances. Fills
the empty boxes with phony cash.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.340
Takes 'em back up to Margrave
for distribution,

27:12.340 --> 27:14.592
but not before he skimmed some
off the top for himself.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.010
You sound confident.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.762
It's a working theory.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.638
Hoping Joe's files confirm it.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.352
Sure we're in the right spot?

27:24.352 --> 27:27.688
2s, 3w. Two blocks south,
three west of Picard's office.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.774
We're in the right spot.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.859
Here he comes.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.864
Count to four, then follow.

27:45.915 --> 27:49.001
- Everyone holding up okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.128
What about Charlie and the kids?
Who's watching them?

27:51.212 --> 27:53.047
Nobody. But she can handle
herself for a couple hours.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.174
What'd you get on the VIN?

27:55.174 --> 27:58.427
Registered to a Chevy Equinox
owned by a car rental company.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.137
Someone picked it up last week,

28:00.221 --> 28:01.639
then the plates get pinged
at a motel

28:01.639 --> 28:03.057
40 miles outside Margrave.

28:03.057 --> 28:05.309
Only problem,

28:05.393 --> 28:07.686
both car and motel
were under the name Ron Hassey.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.146
That's Joe.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.774
He used the names
of Yankees backup catchers.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.275
Good thing
I didn't write this off, then.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.319
You know, chances are he never
checked out of that motel.

28:15.403 --> 28:17.029
He might have left
something important behind.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.280
It's possible.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.783
He kept meticulous records,
lots of notes.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.829
Motel address.
1517 Oglethorpe Road.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.705
Memorize it, toss it.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.416
Do me a favor, guys.

28:28.416 --> 28:29.834
Hurry up
and close this thing out.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.086
I'm stuck in the sticks
and I'm gonna lose my job.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.004
Appreciate your help.

28:36.090 --> 28:39.510
<i>♪ Well, you got mothers
all over town</i> ♪

28:39.510 --> 28:41.345
<i>♪ They're screaming
and crying...</i>

28:41.429 --> 28:43.180
Yeah,
Ron Hassey stayed here.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.515
- How come you're asking?
- We need to see

28:44.515 --> 28:45.933
if he left behind
some personal items.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.059
He did.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.519
Briefcase and a garment bag.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.688
They were picked up
about 20 minutes ago.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.314
By who?

28:52.398 --> 28:53.649
Ron Hassey.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.443
What did he look like?

28:55.443 --> 28:58.279
About medium height. Foreign.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.364
Maybe Hispanic or something?

29:02.658 --> 29:04.743
They got a 20-minute head start
and could've gone

29:04.827 --> 29:06.370
in any direction. That briefcase

29:06.454 --> 29:08.581
- is good as gone.
- His briefcase doesn't matter.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.374
- You said he takes field notes.
- He does.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.500
And he knew
someone might come after 'em,

29:11.584 --> 29:13.544
so he'd put 'em
where they wouldn't look.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.004
If you were walking out of there

29:15.004 --> 29:16.505
with Joe's stuff,
looking for his paperwork,

29:16.589 --> 29:18.340
- what would you do?
- Get lost before his giant brother

29:18.424 --> 29:19.467
- found me.
- Right.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.093
You'd move fast.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.137
Keep the briefcase,
dump the garment bag.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.474
Fuck.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.100
Okay, Joe.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.145
Let's see if you're as smart
as I think you are.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.164
No way.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.377
- Looks like a punch list.
- Oh!

29:55.461 --> 29:58.088
Cover!

30:01.884 --> 30:04.637
- The tire's blown.
- Soon as I fire, we run in opposite directions.

30:04.637 --> 30:07.431
Harder to hit us if we split up.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.808
On three. One, two, three.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.185
Son of a bitch.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.624
Mateo!

32:03.589 --> 32:05.758
You just killed my cousin.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.384
Now I'm gonna paint your skull

32:07.468 --> 32:09.178
all over the ground...

32:20.022 --> 32:22.775
Thanks.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.652
You made them follow you

32:24.652 --> 32:26.278
'cause you had Joe's note!

32:26.362 --> 32:27.488
Yeah, so you'd stay alive.

32:27.488 --> 32:28.947
I don't need
you looking out for me.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.074
I'm a fucking cop, not some girl

32:30.074 --> 32:31.200
who needs your protection.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.618
- Clearly.
- We agreed

32:32.618 --> 32:34.036
last night changed nothing.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.496
What the hell were you thinking?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.337
I was thinking when Joe died,

32:43.337 --> 32:45.631
there was almost no one left
in the world I cared about.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.008
And that felt bad.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.010
And then I met you...

32:50.094 --> 32:52.721
and I felt better.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.310
Come on, we got
to change a tire.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.867
Finlay.

33:13.951 --> 33:15.953
- You find anything?
- Yeah.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.871
And then a couple
of guys found us.

33:17.955 --> 33:19.206
More bodies?

33:19.206 --> 33:21.583
You know
what I want to know?

33:21.667 --> 33:24.503
<i>How the hell those guys got
to the motel before we did.</i>

33:25.629 --> 33:27.673
Stevenson took
the call from Picard

33:27.673 --> 33:30.342
and forwarded it
to the main line.

33:30.426 --> 33:31.719
He could have listened in.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.929
I mean, anyone
at the station could have.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.557
Or... I don't know.

33:36.557 --> 33:39.393
Maybe Stevenson's innocent act
an act.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.311
Picard's called me
at the station

33:41.395 --> 33:43.188
a few times over the past year.

33:43.272 --> 33:45.357
Stevenson could have
known his voice,

33:45.441 --> 33:47.651
deciphered the meeting location
and Kliner could have

33:47.735 --> 33:49.486
had guys ready and waiting
by the time you arrived.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.696
When I found

33:50.696 --> 33:51.864
Spivey in the trunk
of that car,

33:51.864 --> 33:53.699
there was surveillance gear.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.201
It's not a stretch to think
they listened on parabolic mics.

33:56.285 --> 33:58.245
I can't believe
Stevenson's dirty.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.372
But...

34:00.456 --> 34:02.124
I guess he was asking
a lot of questions.

34:02.124 --> 34:05.043
Pretending to be concerned
about the Hubbles.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.380
God, that sneaky piece of shit.

34:08.464 --> 34:11.175
I guess he found out
Joe's fake name

34:11.175 --> 34:14.011
and the motel,
and they beat us there.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.597
Yeah, well, we're the ones
that walked away.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.017
<i>All right, we need to go through
what you found.</i>

34:20.017 --> 34:21.727
But not over the phone. <i>- I-I know a place.</i>

34:21.727 --> 34:23.270
<i>An abandoned farmhouse.</i>

34:23.270 --> 34:24.813
Far enough outside Margrave,
totally secluded.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.190
I'll text you the location.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.150
All right, see you soon.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.153
It was good we were careful
around Stevenson.

34:36.492 --> 34:37.534
You still mad at me?

34:40.537 --> 34:42.122
I know you don't
need protection,

34:42.206 --> 34:44.958
but I went with my instinct.

34:47.044 --> 34:49.838
Just like I was taught.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.716
This wasn't some
butterball, snot-nosed step-kid.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.761
Your boy pummeled
a brigadier general's son.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.054
That Bishop boy
has been a problem

34:57.054 --> 34:58.806
ever since we set foot
in Okinawa.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.849
My boys were only standing up
for Billy Docette.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.559
Well, the Docettes don't want
to get involved.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.061
His dad's thinking
about his career.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.479
As should you, Stan.

35:05.479 --> 35:06.980
It's a disagreement
between kids.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.440
Correct.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.943
And your kid smashed
another kid's face in.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.611
So what are
we talking about here?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.947
Joe's a minor-- there's
not much they can do to him.

35:14.947 --> 35:17.449
But Bishop's gonna
take it out on Stan

35:17.533 --> 35:18.992
- any way he can.
- What have you heard?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.702
He's gonna find some

35:20.786 --> 35:22.204
reason to bust you down a rank.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.622
Cut your pay.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.457
Transfer you out
of Okinawa to some

35:25.541 --> 35:27.417
shit assignment in Germany.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.962
- Jesus.
- But Stanley didn't do anything wrong.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.380
There must be
some way to fix this.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.549
I would if I could, Josephine,
truly.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.968
But Bishop's a vindictive S.O.B.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.469
Always has been.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.930
He's gonna torpedo
my whole career.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.516
Sorry to be
the bearer of bad news, but

35:42.516 --> 35:43.934
just wanted to give you
the heads-up.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.936
Appreciate it, Butch.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.688
You're a good man.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.112
Boys, come here.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.744
Is what he said true?

36:02.828 --> 36:04.705
Yes.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.292
It's not fair
that you get in trouble.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.460
That's right.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.213
Should have thought of that
before you did what you did.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.687
He hates me.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.694
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- No.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.738
You're not.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.448
You're 12, Reacher. I'm not
letting you get involved.

36:39.448 --> 36:42.618
- But, Joe, I can...
- Your instinct was to keep your mouth shut.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.494
It was the right one.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.413
Now stay out of it.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.093
<i>E Unum Pluribus.</i>

37:00.177 --> 37:01.595
Out of one, many.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.138
Should be "out of many, one."

37:03.138 --> 37:04.890
<i>E Pluribus Unum.</i>
It's backwards.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.558
Do you think
that's just a mistake?

37:06.642 --> 37:08.268
Joe never did anything
by mistake.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.729
Well, P.H. is obviously
Paul Hubble.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.565
W.B.?
Anyone know that area code?

37:13.649 --> 37:15.192
Hmm, beats me.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.985
The next one's S.C.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.570
- That's New York.
- I led a joint

37:18.654 --> 37:19.905
investigation with the Air National Guard

37:19.905 --> 37:21.323
out of Memphis once.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.700
- Think J.
- W's 901's the area code there.

37:23.784 --> 37:24.868
But these two I don't get.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.870
Joblings' Garage
and Gray's Kliner file.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.789
Already been
to Jobling's garage.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.374
Empty boxes

37:30.374 --> 37:32.084
that didn't tell us anything
we didn't already know.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.502
And Gray didn't have
a Kliner file.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.087
When he died,
I went through his office

37:35.087 --> 37:36.922
and his house,
cleaned out everything.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.548
There's nothing
on Kliner anywhere.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.051
Let's run a search on these
numbers, see who they belong to.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.095
Or we could call them.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.680
Or we can do that.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.224
I'll take the mystery number.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.559
I'll try New York.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.603
Memphis.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.405
United States
Environmental Protection Agency.

38:01.405 --> 38:03.949
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

38:03.949 --> 38:06.243
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Okay.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.662
So "W.B." is William Bryant,

38:08.662 --> 38:10.414
Economics Professor at Princeton.

38:10.414 --> 38:12.416
According to his voicemail,
at a conference in Europe,

38:12.416 --> 38:14.710
due to return in three days,
not checking messages.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.753
Strange, my number went

38:16.837 --> 38:18.755
to the economics department
at Columbia.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.133
S.C. is
Professor Stephanie Castillo.

38:21.133 --> 38:24.469
Also at the European conference,
also back in three days.

38:24.553 --> 38:27.389
- Let me guess, you called Memphis State?
- No.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.224
Memphis office of the EPA.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.600
What the hell does

38:30.684 --> 38:32.686
any of this have
to do with counterfeiting?

38:32.686 --> 38:33.854
What does Hubble's number being

38:33.854 --> 38:34.896
in my brother's shoe
have to do with it?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.398
Or South America?

38:36.398 --> 38:37.774
- Or animal feed?
- Okay.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.693
You got to give
the last one a rest.

38:39.693 --> 38:41.111
It was a hell of a lot
of animal feed.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.155
Bottom line, we need

38:43.155 --> 38:45.157
to jump on the Memphis EPA
lead ASAP.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.450
If Joe was looking
into crooked agents

38:46.450 --> 38:47.743
at the federal level,
they can do

38:47.743 --> 38:49.161
a lot more damage
than college professors.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.495
You can't go to Tennessee.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.330
Molly Beth lands
in less than an hour.

38:52.414 --> 38:53.582
And there might be shorthand
in your brother's

38:53.582 --> 38:55.125
files only you understand.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.170
Right, and you two need to keep
up appearances with Teale.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.592
I know a PI who can help.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.385
Someone we can trust?

39:05.469 --> 39:07.471
Trusted her with my life
on countless occasions.

39:07.471 --> 39:10.057
She hasn't let me down once.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.563
<i>- Reacher.</i>
- Hello, Neagley.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.148
How'd you know it was me? <i>- Only person</i>

39:18.148 --> 39:20.567
with my private number
other than my dad.

39:20.567 --> 39:24.029
And this time of day, he enjoys
the jurisprudential musings

39:24.029 --> 39:26.406
of one Judge Judy.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.367
It's been a minute and a half.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.078
What's up?

39:31.078 --> 39:32.704
Gonna run it down
fast and clean. Ready?

39:33.914 --> 39:35.207
Hit me.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.833
<i>My brother was working
for Secret Service.</i>

39:36.917 --> 39:38.627
He was looking
into counterfeiting in Georgia.

39:38.627 --> 39:39.753
Last week, he got
too close to the truth,

39:39.753 --> 39:40.962
someone killed him for it.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.590
Shit.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.383
You okay?

39:45.467 --> 39:46.760
My brother was killed, not me.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.221
My mistake.
Forgot who I was talking to.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.598
Joe's notes had the number
to the Memphis EPA office,

39:51.598 --> 39:53.809
next to the initials J.W.--
that's all I have.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.310
<i>- Number and initials.</i>
- All I need.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.812
I'm on it.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.106
And, hey, boss.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.399
If you want to talk...

40:01.483 --> 40:02.567
We just did.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.278
You're an emotional
dumpster fire.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.239
You know that? Stop dissembling.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.949
Goodbye, Neagley.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.951
She always talk
to you like that?

40:10.951 --> 40:13.453
No.
Sometimes she speaks her mind.

40:13.537 --> 40:14.538
We should get going.

40:14.538 --> 40:16.957
Molly Beth will be landing soon.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.917
We should leave the Jag here.
Bullet holes are a bit

40:18.917 --> 40:20.252
- of a neon sign.
- I'll drive.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.837
Hope you like .38 Special.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.465
Oh, you're serious.

40:25.549 --> 40:30.053
<i>♪ I never knew
there'd come a day...</i>

40:30.137 --> 40:32.764
It says Molly Beth's plane
lands in 15 minutes.

40:32.848 --> 40:34.599
She's just dropping off papers,

40:34.683 --> 40:36.351
so she doesn't have
any checked bags.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.727
Ten minutes to disembark,

40:37.811 --> 40:38.979
five to use the ladies room,

40:38.979 --> 40:40.313
ten to walk
to the airport subway,

40:40.397 --> 40:41.523
two to get a ticker
at the kiosk.

40:41.523 --> 40:42.858
Train departs
every five minutes.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.985
How long's the ride
from ATL to Five Points?

40:44.985 --> 40:46.862
15, 20 minutes?

40:46.862 --> 40:48.572
Okay, so we should get there

40:48.572 --> 40:50.031
between one and six minutes
before she does,

40:50.115 --> 40:51.241
depending on traffic.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.620
We don't know
what she looks like.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.414
How is she gonna find us?

40:57.414 --> 40:59.249
She knows what Joe looks like.

40:59.249 --> 41:01.001
And I look like Joe.

41:01.001 --> 41:04.212
<i>♪ So caught up in you,
little girl...</i>

41:04.296 --> 41:06.464
Know you're a blues guy,
Reacher, but come on,

41:06.548 --> 41:08.550
you got to feel this.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.220
No.

41:12.304 --> 41:15.348
<i>♪ You caught me, baby,
you taught me</i> ♪

41:15.432 --> 41:18.310

41:19.769 --> 41:21.605
- Okay.
- <i>It took so ♪</i>♪

41:23.815 --> 41:26.276
She'll either be on the gold
or red northbound train.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.862
They arrive
on different platforms.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.246
Looks like we found her.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.627
She wants to meet us
at the top of the escalator.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.095
Where is she?

41:54.179 --> 41:56.097
Well, she must have missed us
and walked right by.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.933
No one misses me
when they walk by.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.647
Something's wrong.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.857
We need to split up.
You take the stairs,

42:05.941 --> 42:07.943
you take the elevator.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.570
To the side, to the side.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.410
Oh, fuck.

42:51.528 --> 42:54.572
Okay... okay. Hey.

42:54.656 --> 42:56.741
Hey. Oh, God.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.581
Joe...
