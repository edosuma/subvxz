00:20.056 --> 00:22.859
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:22.893 --> 00:24.128
Is this her?

00:24.161 --> 00:27.498
Oh, it's been such
a long time, my child.

00:27.532 --> 00:28.766
When she was brought to us,

00:28.800 --> 00:31.268
apparently Rachel was
hiding from her father.

00:31.301 --> 00:33.570
<i>The young woman's fear
was quite convincing.</i>

00:33.604 --> 00:35.472
Hey, you want my advice?
Don't be Robin.

00:35.506 --> 00:37.240
<i>All those years
Bruce was helping me?</i>

00:37.274 --> 00:38.944
<i>He was turning me
into a weapon.</i>

00:38.976 --> 00:41.155
<i>You can't unlearn what he teaches
you and you can't control it.</i>

00:41.179 --> 00:43.414
Lights out, bitch!

00:43.448 --> 00:45.883
- What's going on?
- You tried to kill Rachel.

00:47.451 --> 00:48.886
Kory, stop!
You're hurting her!

00:50.841 --> 00:52.189
I have to go.

00:52.222 --> 00:54.225
- Kory?
- I'm here.

00:54.258 --> 00:56.259
I come from a planet
called Tamaran.

00:56.293 --> 00:57.462
Anything else coming back?

00:57.494 --> 00:59.073
Rachel, sweetie, come on.
You've gotta get up.

00:59.097 --> 01:01.899
<i>- What is it?
- It's Gar. He's sick. Come on.</i>

01:01.932 --> 01:03.768
He's dying! I can feel it.

01:03.801 --> 01:06.870
Your father. He's stronger than you.
He could save Gar.

01:11.742 --> 01:12.944
My child.

01:12.977 --> 01:15.444
This being was summoned to
Earth to conceive a daughter.

01:15.478 --> 01:16.813
Trigon.

01:16.814 --> 01:19.551
Earth will be the first planet that
he will cover in his darkness.

01:19.584 --> 01:22.052
- Who's this?
- Rachel's mother.

01:22.085 --> 01:23.120
It's a family affair.

01:23.153 --> 01:26.189
My friend is dying.
Can you save him?

01:28.325 --> 01:29.459
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:29.493 --> 01:31.194
<i>I'm finally home.</i>

01:31.228 --> 01:32.461
What the fuck
is going on?

01:32.462 --> 01:34.064
It's right where
the house should be.

01:34.097 --> 01:36.099
Is it time to eat the world?

01:36.132 --> 01:38.102
<i>Not until
her heart breaks.</i>

01:38.135 --> 01:40.834
Dick, wait!

02:14.872 --> 02:15.872
Daddy!

02:21.545 --> 02:24.782
You're gonna pay for that!
You've disturbed the beast!

02:24.816 --> 02:28.852
There's no escape.
Nothing can save you now!

02:32.490 --> 02:35.789
- Yay!
- Hey! Come here.

02:38.762 --> 02:41.132
Mommy! Save me!

02:42.400 --> 02:46.236
Hi! Oh, my gosh!
You're soaking wet!

02:46.270 --> 02:48.739
- So are you.
- It's all his fault, isn't it?

02:48.771 --> 02:51.508
- No!
- Yeah!

02:51.542 --> 02:53.443
Honey, now
that I have you here,

02:53.478 --> 02:55.612
Winter Shamrock
or Mango Tango?

02:55.646 --> 02:57.490
You don't wanna wait
until we find out what it is?

02:57.514 --> 03:00.016
Silly me. Here I thought
we were having a human.

03:01.384 --> 03:03.397
- Do less comedy. Seriously.
- I'm gonna do more comedy.

03:03.421 --> 03:06.957
I don't wanna do the whole boy means blue,
girl means pink thing again.

03:06.991 --> 03:09.493
Besides, once we know what it is,
we're gonna be so busy,

03:09.526 --> 03:10.929
we're not
gonna have time to paint.

03:10.961 --> 03:14.298
I want this whole room done
and cleared out by this week.

03:14.331 --> 03:16.433
- I want a sister.
- You do?

03:16.467 --> 03:17.801
That's awesome, buddy,

03:17.836 --> 03:20.304
but sometimes we don't get
to choose what we want.

03:20.337 --> 03:22.306
We get what we get.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.140
Whoa! Look out! Whoa!

03:24.175 --> 03:29.014
Oops.

03:29.046 --> 03:32.850
Let me help you. What's the big rush?
We still have a month to go.

03:32.883 --> 03:35.252
Yeah. As long as I don't
deliver early again.

03:35.253 --> 03:36.453
If you keep
dragging furniture around,

03:36.454 --> 03:38.221
you're gonna deliver
right here on the floor.

03:38.222 --> 03:39.657
Don't say that.

03:39.691 --> 03:41.626
Did you give birth
to me on the floor?

03:41.658 --> 03:44.562
No, we had you
in the hospital.

03:44.596 --> 03:47.899
But you were early.
And you did take nine hours.

03:47.932 --> 03:50.200
But according to the nurses,
it's no big deal,

03:50.234 --> 03:52.103
and I should
consider myself lucky.

03:52.135 --> 03:53.503
You know what your daddy did?

03:53.538 --> 03:56.841
He helped me get your room
ready three months early,

03:56.875 --> 04:01.875
so we didn't have
to worry about anything.

04:02.145 --> 04:03.647
I got a great idea.

04:03.681 --> 04:04.948
Why don't I
spend the afternoon

04:04.949 --> 04:06.582
painting these walls
and getting the room set up?

04:06.584 --> 04:11.155
That's an amazing idea!
Your daddy's a genius.

04:11.187 --> 04:15.727
Right?

04:15.759 --> 04:17.495
- You wanna go see who that is?
- FaceTime!

04:17.528 --> 04:20.096
- Come on, let's go!
- Wait for me!

04:29.706 --> 04:31.009
- Hey, animals!
<i>- Hey, Johnny!</i>

04:31.041 --> 04:33.543
- Hey!
<i>- We're mostly calling for Johnny.</i>

04:33.577 --> 04:34.889
<i>So, did you get
the gifts we sent?</i>

04:34.913 --> 04:37.714
Yes! The bunny lamp is so
cute, it's disturbing,

04:37.749 --> 04:39.817
and it goes perfectly
in the nursery.

04:39.850 --> 04:43.187
- She almost broke it. I saved it.
<i>- Of course you did, Dick.</i>

04:43.221 --> 04:46.456
<i>Johnny... So, did you get
the gift I got you?</i>

04:46.490 --> 04:49.694
- Yay!
- He loves it. He won't put it down.

04:49.726 --> 04:51.894
<i>Okay, so,
what are we naming it?</i>

04:53.298 --> 04:58.002
<i>- Gar Junior? Little Gar? Or how about...
- No, his name is Growly.</i>

04:58.035 --> 05:01.004
<i>That's... Yeah. Creative.</i>

05:01.038 --> 05:02.540
Everything okay at college?

05:02.572 --> 05:04.175
<i>Yeah!
Nah, things are great.</i>

05:04.209 --> 05:06.452
<i>We're four weeks in and Rachel
hasn't been expelled yet, so...</i>

05:06.476 --> 05:09.245
<i>Oh, yeah, and Gar
hasn't been to class. So...</i>

05:10.413 --> 05:11.881
You guys are doing great.
I'm really proud.

05:11.882 --> 05:14.584
<i>Hey, um, I know
maybe it's a little early,</i>

05:14.619 --> 05:16.855
<i>but it's getting
very cold in Chicago.</i>

05:16.887 --> 05:20.290
<i>Maybe we can come visit you
guys for Thanksgiving?</i>

05:20.324 --> 05:21.959
- Yay!
- Yes! We'd love that.

05:21.992 --> 05:23.961
One of you guys are gonna
have to share the room

05:23.994 --> 05:25.230
with Johnny and Growly,

05:25.262 --> 05:27.564
and there's gonna be a new
baby screaming all night long,

05:27.598 --> 05:28.867
but we'd love to have you.

05:28.899 --> 05:30.468
<i>Well, it's either that
or Christmas,</i>

05:30.502 --> 05:32.579
<i>so you can choose which
holiday you want Gar to ruin.</i>

05:32.603 --> 05:33.637
<i>Totally up to you.</i>

05:33.670 --> 05:35.874
- We'll take both.
- Miss you guys.

05:35.906 --> 05:39.442
<i>- Miss you too, man.
- But mostly Johnny. Bye, Johnny!</i>

05:39.476 --> 05:41.644
Bye!

05:41.677 --> 05:45.014
Bye!

05:45.048 --> 05:46.250
They're so grown up now.

05:46.283 --> 05:49.754
I know.
I still worry about Rachel, though.

05:49.786 --> 05:54.324
She's doing good.
She's doing great. She made it.

05:54.358 --> 05:57.060
Yeah. I guess we all did.

05:57.093 --> 05:58.093
Yeah.

06:04.069 --> 06:09.069
Dad? There's somebody
coming up the driveway.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.651
Hey, bro. What's up?

06:21.685 --> 06:26.685
- Jason?
- Been five years. Do I look different?

06:27.891 --> 06:30.661
It must be the haircut.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.129
What are you doing here?

06:33.163 --> 06:36.132
It's Batman.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.636
He's in trouble.

06:56.687 --> 07:00.324
- Do you want anything? Coffee, or...
- No, I'm okay.

07:00.358 --> 07:02.060
This is really nice, man.

07:02.093 --> 07:06.197
I knew you lived out here,
had a family, but this...

07:06.230 --> 07:11.002
Good for you, man.

07:11.036 --> 07:14.505
- Jason, what happened?
- Ah, I was stupid. Totally my fault.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.151
The Riddler and some guys were hitting
jewelry stores late at night.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.776
Batman and I staked one out,
caught 'em coming in.

07:19.810 --> 07:20.988
Should've gone down
real simple,

07:21.012 --> 07:24.048
but I got too cocky.
Big surprise.

07:24.081 --> 07:27.851
Went straight for him. Thought I
could take him down on my own.

07:27.886 --> 07:31.788
You know how the Riddler
never uses a gun?

07:31.822 --> 07:35.593
Well, now he does.
Bullet hit my T5 vertebra.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.127
It's still there.

07:38.161 --> 07:40.230
Jesus.

07:40.264 --> 07:42.365
I'm sorry.

07:42.399 --> 07:46.771
Gotham's gotten worse, man.

07:46.803 --> 07:50.675
Way fucking worse.

07:50.708 --> 07:54.144
- Commissioner Gordon's dead.
- What?

07:54.178 --> 07:57.915
Three days ago.
It was the Joker, and it was bad.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.817
Kept him alive
for almost a week.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.985
Texted pictures
of what he was doing.

08:02.019 --> 08:06.858
By the time Bruce figured out
where he was, it was too late.

08:06.891 --> 08:10.528
Never seen him look like that.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.911
He's going to kill the Joker.

08:16.266 --> 08:18.036
He would never do that.

08:18.069 --> 08:22.005
- Bruce has a line he'll never cross.
- Things have changed, Dick.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.675
First, Alfred dies, and then this,
and now Commissioner Gordon.

08:25.709 --> 08:29.213
It's like something inside
of him just snapped.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.149
Whatever was holding
him together is gone.

08:31.182 --> 08:32.750
So why come here
and tell me?

08:32.783 --> 08:34.952
Because you're
the real Robin, man.

08:34.985 --> 08:37.956
Okay? You always were.
Not me.

08:37.989 --> 08:41.392
The truth is, he was never
the same after you left.

08:41.424 --> 08:42.692
Alfred said it.

08:42.726 --> 08:46.230
Barbara said it.
Even heard Superman say it once.

08:46.264 --> 08:49.234
I just didn't wanna believe it,
but it's true.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.135
You were the only one
he ever listened to.

08:51.168 --> 08:56.168
Maybe the only one he ever cared
about after his parents died.

08:56.307 --> 09:01.307
You need to come back to Gotham
and convince him not to do it.

09:11.121 --> 09:15.058
I can't.
I swore I'd never go back.

09:15.092 --> 09:16.792
Besides, I haven't
spoken to Bruce in years.

09:16.793 --> 09:19.163
Dick, the whole thing
with Tony Zucco...

09:19.197 --> 09:20.831
Look, you know
what he's going through.

09:20.865 --> 09:23.268
If he does this,
there's no coming back.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.868
He's the only hero
that Gotham has left.

09:24.869 --> 09:28.538
The only one left
with some sense of justice.

09:28.572 --> 09:32.176
If he goes bad,
the city goes down.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.910
Dude...

09:33.945 --> 09:38.945
you're the only one
that can save him.

09:48.259 --> 09:50.293
If Bruce wants to do something,
he's gonna do it.

09:50.326 --> 09:52.096
We both know that.

09:52.129 --> 09:55.267
He dresses up like a bat to fight crime.
That works for him.

09:55.299 --> 09:59.269
But this, this idea that I'm the only
one who can save him is bullshit.

09:59.302 --> 10:02.139
- Then, who?
- What?

10:02.173 --> 10:06.009
Jim Gordon's dead. Alfred's dead.
Barbara's missing.

10:06.043 --> 10:08.947
He fell out with Superman
years ago.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.414
- He's alone.
- He's always alone.

10:11.448 --> 10:14.218
Not when you're around.

10:14.219 --> 10:15.985
How're you gonna feel
if you don't at least try?

10:15.986 --> 10:20.986
Bruce Wayne's
not my responsibility.

10:22.726 --> 10:27.298
I'm sorry.

10:27.331 --> 10:28.767
Look...

10:28.801 --> 10:33.801
after the baby, if he still hasn't
gotten his shit together, I'll go.

10:36.273 --> 10:38.176
Okay.

10:38.208 --> 10:42.246
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.

10:42.279 --> 10:46.150
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.

10:46.183 --> 10:51.183
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo.

10:51.355 --> 10:53.754
Chugga, chugga...

11:05.702 --> 11:07.171
Feel it?

11:08.940 --> 11:11.741
Growly wants to go with you.

11:11.775 --> 11:15.745
- Go where, sweetie?
- To Gotham City.

11:15.779 --> 11:18.249
Wow. Eavesdropper!

11:18.283 --> 11:22.452
- But Growly's your favorite.
- He'll protect you.

11:25.756 --> 11:29.427
Look, honey, I know your relationship
with Bruce is more than complicated.

11:29.461 --> 11:32.730
And I know last time you saw each
other, you said some things...

11:32.763 --> 11:35.299
But he saved you, Dick.

11:35.332 --> 11:38.436
What if you're the last person
on Earth who can save him back?

11:38.470 --> 11:43.470
- Baby, that's absurd.
- But what if?

11:54.851 --> 11:57.087
Hey!

11:57.120 --> 11:58.990
- Where to?
- Downtown.

11:59.023 --> 12:01.158
I don't stop downtown.

12:01.192 --> 12:05.696
- Midtown.
- I don't stop below 99th.

12:05.730 --> 12:08.198
Uptown.
Can you recommend a hotel?

12:08.232 --> 12:13.232
Yeah. The Four Seasons Boston.
It's about four hours north of here.

12:32.056 --> 12:34.958
Hey, Bruce. It's me.

12:34.991 --> 12:37.629
I know it's been awhile,
but, uh...

12:37.662 --> 12:42.662
Anyway, I'm in Gotham.
I wanna talk to you in person.

12:42.832 --> 12:47.638
Let me know
you got this, okay?

13:02.620 --> 13:05.655
- Get out of the fucking street!
- Come on, man, kill him!

13:05.688 --> 13:06.791
Kill him, man!

13:06.823 --> 13:09.073
Hey! Hey!

13:32.283 --> 13:34.951
I see what you mean
about the bad part of town.

13:34.985 --> 13:39.936
Every part's a bad part.

13:42.493 --> 13:45.793
Jesus Christ.

13:54.804 --> 13:58.009
Good luck.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.677
Thank you.

14:00.711 --> 14:04.682
Hey. You new in town, baby?

14:22.133 --> 14:25.370
- May I help you?
- I need a room.

14:25.403 --> 14:30.006
- Of course. How many hours do you want?
- I'm staying all night.

14:30.041 --> 14:33.144
Oh, very good. Um...

14:33.177 --> 14:38.149
Our rate is $55
for the whole night.

14:38.182 --> 14:43.182
And I'm afraid
we only accept cash.

14:43.388 --> 14:47.857
Will you be needing
fresh sheets, sir?

14:47.892 --> 14:48.892
Yeah.

14:54.764 --> 14:58.965
That'll be an additional $6.

15:03.975 --> 15:05.009
Okay.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.510
Uh...

15:06.543 --> 15:11.543
- Room 309. Third floor.
- Thank you.

15:14.519 --> 15:19.318
Uh, the elevator's
under repair.

15:59.663 --> 16:02.134
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

16:02.167 --> 16:04.610
<i>Mary-Lou.
Morning, Bob. Sit right here.</i>

16:04.634 --> 16:05.736
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:05.769 --> 16:07.147
<i>Folks at the
courthouse said you looked</i>

16:07.171 --> 16:09.374
<i>mighty handsome
in those new jeans.</i>

16:09.407 --> 16:11.210
<i>Oh, thanks, Mary-Lou.</i>

16:11.243 --> 16:14.245
<i>And especially in those boots
with the Lone Star stitched on 'em.</i>

16:14.278 --> 16:17.947
What the fuck
are we doing here, Growly?

16:17.981 --> 16:19.149
You wanna go home?

16:21.618 --> 16:22.952
Me, too.

16:25.556 --> 16:27.024
Yeah!

16:27.058 --> 16:31.062
<i>...creating chaos and taking
the law into their own hands.</i>

16:31.095 --> 16:32.697
<i>The previous commissioner,
Jim Gordon,</i>

16:32.730 --> 16:36.400
<i>kept a close relationship with
various masked crime-fighters.</i>

16:36.433 --> 16:39.537
But that, in turn, attracted
a wave of masked criminals,

16:39.571 --> 16:42.440
which ultimately
cost him his life.

16:42.474 --> 16:45.409
<i>Tolerating vigilante justice
is over.</i>

16:45.442 --> 16:50.442
The crime in this city is, and has
always been, a police matter.

16:50.548 --> 16:52.484
And the Gotham
Police Department

16:52.517 --> 16:54.384
is more than able
to meet those challenges.

16:54.418 --> 16:58.690
So, as the new police commissioner,
my first official act

16:58.722 --> 17:02.625
will be to permanently retire
the Bat-Signal.

17:14.105 --> 17:15.906
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you talk to him yet?

17:15.941 --> 17:18.375
<i>No. He can be a little
hard to track down at night.</i>

17:18.409 --> 17:21.179
- Mommy!
- Baby, I'll be right back!

17:21.211 --> 17:22.681
What's going on?
Is that Johnny?

17:22.713 --> 17:25.048
<i>Yes, he started throwing up
about an hour after you left,</i>

17:25.082 --> 17:26.983
and now he's got
a really bad fever.

17:27.018 --> 17:29.319
And now he won't
let me out of his sight.

17:29.354 --> 17:32.223
- <i>Did you call a doctor?
- Yes, I called the doctor.</i>

17:32.257 --> 17:36.394
- <i>Sorry.
- I'm just trying to bring his fever down.</i>

17:36.426 --> 17:39.230
Sorry, I think I'm just feeling
a little bit overwhelmed.

17:39.262 --> 17:41.031
I wish you were here.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.737
<i>He misses you.</i>

17:46.769 --> 17:50.307
We miss you and Growly.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.142
This is stupid.
You know what?

17:52.143 --> 17:53.376
I'm heading
back to the airport.

17:53.377 --> 17:55.546
<i>It could be days
before I track him down.</i>

17:56.647 --> 17:58.982
- Okay.
<i>- I'll check on flights.</i>

18:03.054 --> 18:04.888
Let me call you back.

18:07.290 --> 18:08.902
<i>Gotham 911.
What's your emergency?</i>

18:08.926 --> 18:12.663
Domestic violence at the Hotel Montecito,
room 307. Please hurry.

18:16.933 --> 18:20.337
- No!
- Hey! Open up!

18:20.371 --> 18:22.073
Fuck off!

18:29.779 --> 18:30.848
Freeze!

18:30.882 --> 18:35.318
I made the call.
I got the room next door.

18:35.353 --> 18:38.623
Los Angeles? What the
hell are you doing here?

18:38.655 --> 18:43.027
- I'm from here. Back for a visit.
- Who comes back to Gotham?

18:43.059 --> 18:46.730
Sentimental, I guess.

18:46.765 --> 18:48.243
<i>All units requested.</i>

18:48.267 --> 18:51.803
<i>Possible code 391 at the
corner of Chester and 169th.</i>

18:51.836 --> 18:54.704
<i>All units, please respond.
Code 391...</i>

18:54.738 --> 18:56.507
- 391?
- Yeah.

18:56.540 --> 19:01.540
Special code
for these goddamn masks.

19:14.459 --> 19:16.709
Go ahead.

19:31.476 --> 19:35.313
Fuck, Bruce.

19:35.346 --> 19:38.281
You really did it.

19:51.663 --> 19:55.700
- Do I know you?
- I don't know you.

19:55.733 --> 19:58.103
Captain Frank Finney,
Gotham Police.

19:58.135 --> 20:00.672
What the fuck are you doing
skulking around my crime scene?

20:00.704 --> 20:03.842
Detective Dick Grayson, LAPD.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.243
I used to live here.
I was just passing through.

20:06.277 --> 20:08.579
You see anything?

20:08.613 --> 20:13.613
If I were you, I'd have my
guys check that building.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.253
Really? Why?

20:15.287 --> 20:18.890
Because that's the building
he was thrown from. Not that one.

20:18.923 --> 20:22.693
- What makes you think that?
- Position of the body, angle of impact.

20:22.727 --> 20:27.498
Broken window's on the street side,
not on the sidewalk side.

20:27.531 --> 20:29.200
There's no fire escape
on that building.

20:29.232 --> 20:31.135
It's locked at night.
No roof access.

20:31.169 --> 20:36.169
- No one could get up there.
- The guy who threw him off could.

20:38.875 --> 20:42.713
Batman?

20:42.747 --> 20:47.618
You talk like you know him.

20:47.652 --> 20:50.755
If you do, that's
information we could use.

20:50.788 --> 20:55.788
We need anything that can
help us bring him in easier.

20:56.059 --> 20:58.130
Good luck.

20:58.163 --> 21:00.865
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back to Los Angeles.

21:00.898 --> 21:03.310
Why don't you stick around for a while,
I might have a few more questions.

21:03.334 --> 21:04.768
- I'm not a suspect.
- Hey, listen.

21:04.769 --> 21:05.935
I've got a family
to get back to.

21:05.936 --> 21:07.871
I got family
right here in Gotham.

21:07.904 --> 21:09.974
This is my home.

21:10.008 --> 21:15.008
Now, I got some maniac
throwing guys off buildings.

21:17.515 --> 21:21.018
I'd really appreciate
your help.

21:21.050 --> 21:24.050
Good night, Captain.

21:31.429 --> 21:36.429
Jesus! He's still alive!

21:42.573 --> 21:45.476
You were saying?

21:45.509 --> 21:49.946
There's someone
I need to talk to.

23:19.369 --> 23:22.905
Bruce?

23:22.940 --> 23:26.944
Are you there?

23:26.978 --> 23:31.978
Come on. I didn't come all this
way to talk to a damn clock.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.027
Fine.

23:42.059 --> 23:45.395
Okay, here's the thing.
You got lucky tonight.

23:45.429 --> 23:47.699
The Joker isn't dead.

23:47.731 --> 23:52.731
Which means
you're not a murderer.

23:53.704 --> 23:55.640
I know what
you're going through.

23:55.673 --> 24:00.673
After Tony Zucco died,
I felt empty.

24:02.146 --> 24:04.449
And for a long time,
I was in a dark place.

24:04.482 --> 24:09.482
And I wouldn't wish that upon
anyone, especially not you.

24:09.787 --> 24:13.356
But then I found someone
that needed me.

24:13.391 --> 24:17.729
A kid. Sound familiar?

24:17.761 --> 24:20.998
And that led me
right back to...

24:21.030 --> 24:24.469
Life, I guess.

24:24.502 --> 24:29.502
Look, I know you're in a dark place,
too, but you can make it out.

24:30.075 --> 24:34.278
And for you,
it's easier, because...

24:34.311 --> 24:39.311
You haven't crossed the line.
Not exactly. Not yet.

24:41.219 --> 24:46.219
I wanna help you, Bruce,
but you need to talk to me. Please.

25:28.199 --> 25:31.368
- Joker.
- Mmm-hmm. You on the list?

25:31.403 --> 25:36.403
Finney told me they brought him here.
Said I could see him.

26:06.269 --> 26:10.508
They say he's gonna live.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.310
Kory?

26:13.345 --> 26:18.345
Heard you were in town.
Didn't wanna miss the fun.

26:20.884 --> 26:22.287
What're you doing here?

26:22.319 --> 26:24.321
The bureau tends to take
an interest in things like

26:24.355 --> 26:26.824
the murder of a police commissioner.
But now this...

26:26.857 --> 26:29.894
Do the feds know
where you're from?

26:29.926 --> 26:33.865
No, but I avoid the boys in the
basement, just to be safe.

26:33.897 --> 26:37.067
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

26:37.102 --> 26:39.112
Trying to make sure Batman
doesn't go over the edge.

26:39.136 --> 26:43.208
- Little too late for that.
- It could be a lot worse.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.810
Why do you even care? You left
all this behind a long time ago.

26:46.844 --> 26:48.255
You burned your suit.
Why get involved now?

26:48.279 --> 26:49.989
'Cause I might be the only
person in the whole world

26:50.013 --> 26:52.049
who knows
what he's going through.

26:52.083 --> 26:55.987
If there's a chance I can
save him, I'm gonna try.

26:56.019 --> 26:59.190
And what if you can't
save him?

26:59.223 --> 27:02.926
Have you thought of that?
If he lost his conscience, that's...

27:02.961 --> 27:05.663
He never had a conscience.

27:05.695 --> 27:08.833
He had a code.
A sense of justice.

27:08.865 --> 27:10.469
I was the one
with the conscience.

27:10.501 --> 27:15.140
Which means he slept at night,
while I stared holes in the ceiling.

27:15.173 --> 27:20.173
And look where that led you.
A life you care about.

27:20.778 --> 27:25.778
A wife, a kid.
You chose the better life.

27:26.549 --> 27:29.220
Go back to that.

27:29.253 --> 27:34.253
Forget about being
Batman's savior.

27:34.992 --> 27:37.227
Maybe you're right.

27:45.236 --> 27:47.105
I got the hall,
you take the SCU.

27:47.137 --> 27:49.673
- You're the one giving orders now?
- Just do it.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.121
Bruce! Wait!

28:14.633 --> 28:18.268
You stupid bitch! What the fuck
did I say about using your phone?

28:22.339 --> 28:24.674
- Hey!
- What are you fucking gonna do?

28:24.709 --> 28:28.645
Call the cops again?
They didn't do shit.

29:01.078 --> 29:03.314
- Hey.
- He did it. He fucking killed him.

29:03.347 --> 29:06.384
<i>- He killed the Joker.
- Oh, my God.</i>

29:06.417 --> 29:08.752
Yeah, even after I talked to him.
He went out of his way.

29:08.786 --> 29:10.288
It's like he did it
just to spite me.

29:10.320 --> 29:14.224
Hey, I'm about to start on the
window frame. Yellow or green?

29:14.259 --> 29:16.461
- Who's that?
- It's Hank. Let's do green.

29:16.493 --> 29:19.663
- What's he doing there?
- He's helping me paint the nursery.

29:19.696 --> 29:21.999
Jesus, Dawn.
I've been gone one day.

29:22.032 --> 29:23.701
I told you I'd do it
when I got back.

29:23.733 --> 29:26.002
He offered to help.
I said yes.

29:26.037 --> 29:27.672
Hey, you're almost
out of beer, pal.

29:27.705 --> 29:31.542
Might wanna stock up if you
wanna keep the help happy.

29:31.576 --> 29:34.979
- Hey. What is your problem?
- What do you think?

29:35.011 --> 29:36.513
You know what?
That's not fair.

29:36.548 --> 29:38.982
I'm covered in paint, the air
conditioning's out again,

29:39.016 --> 29:40.694
<i>and I've been up half the
night with a sick kid.</i>

29:40.718 --> 29:43.721
You don't get to be mad at me.

29:43.753 --> 29:48.258
I'm sorry. It's just...

29:48.291 --> 29:50.228
Hank?

29:50.260 --> 29:52.730
I'm not having
this conversation again.

29:54.898 --> 29:57.035
I gotta get this. It's Kory.

29:57.067 --> 30:00.304
Of course it is.

30:00.336 --> 30:01.372
Dawn?

30:03.173 --> 30:04.217
- <i>Dick?
- Hey, what's up?</i>

30:04.241 --> 30:07.045
You need to get down here.

30:07.077 --> 30:12.077
I'm at Arkham Asylum,
and it's bad.

31:08.973 --> 31:13.973
Apparently, your old friend figured,
"Why stop at the Joker?"

31:17.080 --> 31:19.983
He didn't stop
with the prisoners.

31:20.017 --> 31:22.920
Guards, nurses...

31:22.953 --> 31:25.855
They found the warden
in his office.

31:25.890 --> 31:29.559
His own family
wouldn't recognize him.

31:29.593 --> 31:32.130
This wasn't justice.

31:32.163 --> 31:35.365
This was a massacre.

31:35.400 --> 31:40.400
There's no saving him anymore.
He can't be saved.

31:41.972 --> 31:45.123
He has to be stopped.

31:48.579 --> 31:50.615
I know how hard
this is for you,

31:50.648 --> 31:54.819
but believe me, you're
making the right choice.

31:54.853 --> 31:59.190
You're gonna save a lot of lives.
You're gonna save his.

31:59.222 --> 32:00.723
And I drive the operation.

32:02.058 --> 32:06.196
If I believe you.

32:06.230 --> 32:09.230
Okay, I'm listening.

32:11.502 --> 32:14.570
- Bruce Wayne.
- Get the fuck out of here.

32:14.605 --> 32:18.642
Batman is Bruce Wayne.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.175
Holy shit.

32:24.182 --> 32:26.183
Okay, listen up.

32:26.217 --> 32:29.319
Before we begin,
let me make this very clear.

32:29.354 --> 32:33.057
This operation
is a hard-target extraction.

32:33.089 --> 32:36.528
We go in with full
and overwhelming force,

32:36.560 --> 32:41.560
but our explicit goal is to bring
in Batman, Bruce Wayne, alive.

32:43.134 --> 32:45.303
Harrison,
your demo team goes in first.

32:45.336 --> 32:48.105
SWAT and sharpshooters
will follow on my orders.

32:48.138 --> 32:51.776
Agent Kory Anders will be liaising.
Let's move!

32:51.809 --> 32:54.611
All right,
you heard the man, let's go.

32:55.779 --> 32:57.757
Our weapons are loaded
with tranquilizing cartridges.

32:57.781 --> 33:01.051
- Once he's down, we bring him out.
- He's not gonna go quietly.

33:01.085 --> 33:05.155
We know what we're up against.

33:05.189 --> 33:08.759
- He has no idea what he's up against.
- None.

33:08.792 --> 33:12.863
- And, Kory...
- Let me guess. Don't kill him.

33:12.896 --> 33:14.798
Yeah. That.

33:39.758 --> 33:43.994
Stand by for breach.
Stand by for breach.

34:01.278 --> 34:04.748
<i>Move, move.</i>

34:04.781 --> 34:06.017
Charge one set.

34:06.049 --> 34:09.500
Charge two set.

34:12.289 --> 34:13.900
Okay, you're coming up
to the western staircase.

34:13.925 --> 34:16.628
I want you to go right past it,
through to the living room.

34:16.661 --> 34:18.039
But the blueprints indicate
a false wall

34:18.063 --> 34:19.806
leading down to a subterranean
structure, the Batcave.

34:19.831 --> 34:21.864
<i>Yeah,
that's what he's expecting.</i>

34:21.898 --> 34:23.400
Go in from the north.

34:23.434 --> 34:27.304
<i>There's a vertical accessway
right behind the clock.</i>

34:27.338 --> 34:32.338
- To the living room! Let's go!
- Sir!

34:48.793 --> 34:52.829
- Patch me through.
<i>- Copy that. Go ahead.</i>

34:52.862 --> 34:56.934
<i>Bruce.</i>

34:56.967 --> 35:00.471
<i>It's Dick.</i>

35:00.505 --> 35:02.840
<i>We're coming after you.</i>

35:02.873 --> 35:04.775
Pulling you out.

35:04.807 --> 35:08.278
<i>Please do not resist.</i>

35:08.311 --> 35:09.880
These are good men.

35:09.914 --> 35:12.815
I don't wanna see anyone
getting hurt, including you.

35:15.420 --> 35:17.670
Let's end this.

35:27.766 --> 35:31.702
<i>- Get a light over here.
- I got nothing.</i>

35:31.735 --> 35:33.204
<i>All clear here, sir.</i>

35:34.304 --> 35:36.407
<i>I got no eyes on him.</i>

35:39.210 --> 35:40.878
- No.
<i>- Look out!</i>

35:51.155 --> 35:53.190
Finney, get the fuck
out of there, now!

36:12.376 --> 36:16.425
<i>No, no, no!</i>

36:18.315 --> 36:21.251
No! No, please!

36:47.110 --> 36:49.960
Bat...

37:12.971 --> 37:16.739
Kory, it's not gonna work. Get out
of there! He's got a Cold Gun!

37:24.081 --> 37:27.684
No!

37:27.719 --> 37:30.121
Take it down!
Repeat, take it down!

38:25.141 --> 38:28.278
Kory...

38:31.581 --> 38:33.681
Help, Robin...

38:37.420 --> 38:40.423
Jesus, Bruce, you killed her.

38:40.458 --> 38:43.295
This is what you've
always wanted.

38:43.327 --> 38:48.327
You wanted me to give in to
the darkness, to become you.

38:51.202 --> 38:54.038
Well, fuck you, Bruce.
You win.

39:18.195 --> 39:21.130
Dick.

39:21.164 --> 39:24.068
Dick, please...

39:24.101 --> 39:25.751
Talk to me.

39:30.139 --> 39:31.474
Let him go!

39:31.509 --> 39:35.746
This was not my doing.
This was his.

39:35.780 --> 39:39.483
I offered your friend a path
that wound down many roads,

39:39.516 --> 39:43.153
but, ultimately,
he chose his own way.

39:43.188 --> 39:48.188
To embrace his darkness rather
than deny its existence.

39:48.492 --> 39:50.094
This was his struggle.

39:50.128 --> 39:55.128
He tried to flee from who
he is, from what he is.

39:56.534 --> 39:58.568
Dick.

39:58.603 --> 40:02.940
I've released your friend
from a terrible burden.

40:02.974 --> 40:07.974
I love him as you do,
because you do.

40:08.213 --> 40:13.213
And with Trigon's blessing,
he's part of the family now.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.420
Oh, Rachel...

40:16.454 --> 40:20.557
It feels so good to be home.

40:20.590 --> 40:24.791
You'll see. They'll all see.

41:59.255 --> 42:00.490
Get down!

42:30.554 --> 42:33.690
No! No!

42:33.724 --> 42:37.027
Please, don't hurt me.
