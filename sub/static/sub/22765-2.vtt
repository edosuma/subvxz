So what does it matter
if I take her tights?

I just wanted to tell

for everything
that her mother's done for me.

that makes things worse?

My parents are Jews, not Gibbs.

Yeah, but now you're mostly known
as that guy from that church.

09:57.634 --> 09:59.846
And I say that as a compliment.

09:59.847 --> 10:01.933
Why are you even interested in acting?

10:01.934 --> 10:04.187
You make way more running this place

10:04.188 --> 10:07.611
than you ever could from doing
an arc on <i>Fuller House,</i>

10:07.612 --> 10:09.824

11:34.953 --> 11:37.206
No one is supposed to be in here.

verbal contract is not enough.

I do, too.

12:27.726 --> 12:32.442
Every day, Nico pulls further away.

12:32.443 --> 12:38.163
If things don't change,
we'll lose her, too.

bigger the A-hole driving it.

just go in the other direction.

- Yeah. Twice, actually.
- Oh, twice!

13:31.435 --> 13:34.190
And you need to be on your best
behavior when you see him tonight.

What's tonight?

You go solo and you just cover for me?

And if anyone should
get the night off, it's me,

in the basement with her.

30:48.549 --> 30:50.302
Why can't I feel my arms?

30:51.680 --> 30:52.933
My legs...

30:58.151 --> 30:59.362
What is this?

31:01.115 --> 31:02.325
It's the light.

31:02.326 --> 31:04.245
- What happens?
- It's okay.

31:04.246 --> 31:08.380
- Please don't.
- Destiny, it's okay. It's okay.

31:09.465 --> 31:10.634
I'm sorry.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.180
Please... No, no, no, no!

31:13.181 --> 31:14.265
Please!

31:14.266 --> 31:15.351
Please, don't!

31:15.352 --> 31:18.900
[sobbing]

31:18.901 --> 31:21.656
Leslie, I'm afraid!

31:21.657 --> 31:23.158
You don't have to be afraid.

31:23.159 --> 31:25.540
Please! Please, I'm afraid!

31:28.838 --> 31:31.259
No, no, no, no! No, no!

31:34.683 --> 31:36.018
I'm afraid!

31:36.019 --> 31:38.858
- Do it. Now.
- Please.

31:40.653 --> 31:42.280
It's okay.

31:42.281 --> 31:43.743
It's gonna be okay, sweet girl.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.618
[Victor] She's gone.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.313
[zips]

32:21.400 --> 32:22.319
I trust you, Alex.

32:39.186 --> 32:40.939
- It worked.
- You cut the power?

32:40.940 --> 32:43.778
My parents just figured it out.
I was covering the flash.

32:43.779 --> 32:45.824
Maybe it'll seem like a circuit blew.

32:45.825 --> 32:48.705
- More like your dumb idea did.
- It's actually really smart.

32:48.706 --> 32:51.501
But we can't just stand around here
like something weird just happened.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.088
I have an idea.

32:53.089 --> 32:55.177
Does that involve waking Molly?

33:03.903 --> 33:06.658
- Okay, baby, hey, be cool.
- Yeah.

33:10.917 --> 33:13.253
...is that your arm in my leg?

33:13.254 --> 33:15.550
Hey, guys, look who showed up.

33:15.551 --> 33:17.094
How was the meeting?

33:17.095 --> 33:20.309
Uh, good, good, just wrapping up.

33:20.310 --> 33:22.313
We heard you guys weren't coming.

33:22.314 --> 33:23.942
Hope it's okay.

33:23.943 --> 33:26.279
Turns out we missed each other
more than we cared to admit.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.242
So, then, everything's good here?

33:28.243 --> 33:30.956
I wouldn't say that.
Nico just landed on green,

33:30.957 --> 33:33.836
so things are about
to get a little freaky.

33:33.837 --> 33:37.176
Oh, my God!

33:37.177 --> 33:41.518
Okay, then, we'll let
you guys get to it.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.818
Parents are leaving soon,
if you kids need rides.

33:50.705 --> 33:53.209
- You think they saw anything?
- I think we're good here.

33:55.631 --> 33:57.635
Game over.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.264
Think they bought it?

34:00.265 --> 34:02.393
[Tina] Our kids are here?

34:02.394 --> 34:06.401
They're in the guest house
playing games like old times.

34:06.402 --> 34:08.237
Didn't seem to have a clue.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.326
Also like old times.

34:10.327 --> 34:12.163
Frankly, it was nice to see.

34:12.164 --> 34:14.918
Breakers are all flipped.
Something must've blown.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.591
- Victor's box.
- Put on quite a show tonight.

34:17.592 --> 34:18.676
It did its job.

34:18.677 --> 34:19.969
Though I'm not sure why it

34:19.971 --> 34:21.389
would cause a power surge.

34:21.389 --> 34:23.351
It's not like it's plugged into a wall.

34:23.353 --> 34:27.275
It's a lot of energy swirling around.
Who knows.

34:27.277 --> 34:29.364
Whatever it was, don't think

34:29.364 --> 34:31.870
it had anything to do with the kids.

34:33.039 --> 34:34.583
You okay?

34:37.339 --> 34:39.385
- That was a hard one.
- Agreed.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.647
If everyone's good here,

34:45.648 --> 34:47.902
I have to be in the office early.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.338
Want some help with that thing?

34:58.339 --> 35:00.720
No, you guys go on.
I can pack up myself.

35:07.315 --> 35:09.737
There's no way my parents
would kill someone, all right,

35:09.738 --> 35:11.156
especially an innocent girl.

35:11.157 --> 35:12.868
My parents fight for people like her.

35:12.869 --> 35:15.038
Yeah, so does mine,
and Destiny loved her.

35:15.039 --> 35:17.836
She asked for my number.
She wants to hang out.

35:17.837 --> 35:20.424
She... she can't be... dead.

35:20.425 --> 35:25.434
Here's an idea. How about we just
march down there and ask them?

35:25.435 --> 35:27.271
'Cause finding out my mom is evil

35:27.272 --> 35:29.902
would actually be the least
surprising explanation.

35:29.903 --> 35:32.323
But the rest of our parents
were down there, too.

35:32.324 --> 35:33.910
So you're saying they're all psycho?

35:33.911 --> 35:35.789
Actually describes my dad pretty well.

35:35.790 --> 35:38.460
[Gert] No way. Dale and
Stacey may have their quirks,

35:38.461 --> 35:40.840
but their biggest character flaw
is that they occasionally

35:40.841 --> 35:42.969
listen to Weird Al for pleasure.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.141
Molly, let me see that photo you took.

36:07.728 --> 36:09.983
[thumping on door]

36:34.741 --> 36:36.828
[thumping]

36:56.408 --> 36:58.829
[Destiny gasping]

36:58.830 --> 37:00.792
Please! Please!

37:00.793 --> 37:04.215
You shouldn't be here.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.426
Help me!

37:08.391 --> 37:11.188
[chatter]

37:34.317 --> 37:36.697
All right, we need
to maintain the status quo.

37:36.698 --> 37:38.659
If we start acting weird,
they're gonna notice.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.245
If I don't act weird, they'll notice.

37:40.246 --> 37:42.207
We just need to buy ourselves some time.

37:42.208 --> 37:44.796
Right, there's gotta be a reasonable
explanation for all this.

37:44.797 --> 37:46.675
Right, like time travel.

37:46.676 --> 37:48.012
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

37:49.974 --> 37:52.771
Okay! Great party, kids.

37:52.772 --> 37:55.818
Anybody want some brie to take home?

37:55.819 --> 37:57.279
Seems to be a lot left over.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.657
I wonder why.

37:58.658 --> 38:00.118
Okay. Gert, Molly,

38:00.119 --> 38:01.706
why don't you guys come with us?

38:02.958 --> 38:05.212
Act normal.

38:05.213 --> 38:07.676
Sounds super! Thanks so much.

38:09.764 --> 38:12.310
You've never sounded that happy
in your entire life.

38:14.481 --> 38:18.446
Karolina, it's late. Everyone's
had a long day. Ready?

38:18.447 --> 38:20.660
Great to see you guys.

38:20.661 --> 38:21.830
Drive safe.

38:23.332 --> 38:24.668
Hey.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.800
Thank you... for everything tonight.

38:30.597 --> 38:32.560
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

38:35.732 --> 38:38.153
Your dad texted.
He's outside in the Leapfrog.

38:38.154 --> 38:41.075
Ah, Nemo's new self-driving SUV.

38:41.076 --> 38:43.998
Extra-large trunk space.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.334
We can't leave him waiting.

38:46.713 --> 38:47.798
I wouldn't dream of it.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.807
Alex, where is Nico?

38:52.808 --> 38:54.769
I have a board meeting
first thing tomorrow.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.441
Um, she's freshening up.

38:57.442 --> 38:58.695
I'll tell her you're waiting.

39:00.364 --> 39:01.950
[knock on door]

39:01.951 --> 39:04.998
Nico? It's just me.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.963
Hey. They're starting to get suspicious.

39:18.275 --> 39:19.904
I can't go home.

39:22.367 --> 39:24.705
It was already bad enough
living there, but...

39:26.416 --> 39:27.752
now...

39:27.753 --> 39:28.963
I know. I get it.

39:28.964 --> 39:30.007
No, Alex, you don't.

39:31.970 --> 39:32.888
You can't.

39:36.019 --> 39:39.149
It's always just been you
and your parents,

39:39.150 --> 39:41.488
but I used to have someone...

39:43.910 --> 39:45.871
who'd take my side,

39:45.872 --> 39:47.000
listen to me.

39:50.841 --> 39:52.510
And now I'm all alone...

39:55.057 --> 39:56.226
with them.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.274
You're not alone.

40:00.359 --> 40:01.361
Promise.

40:04.869 --> 40:06.037
[Alex] Hey, guys.

40:06.038 --> 40:08.542
- There she is.
- Finally.

40:08.543 --> 40:11.422
Thanks for everything,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilder.

40:11.423 --> 40:12.843
Have a great night.

40:25.994 --> 40:28.289
Seems like everything
turned around after all.

40:28.290 --> 40:30.961
You and Nico, did I see some sparks?

40:30.962 --> 40:34.886
'Cause I thought I saw some sparks.

40:34.887 --> 40:38.518
Hey, the old man had
some game back in the day,

40:38.519 --> 40:40.188
if you ever need some advice.

40:40.189 --> 40:42.150
Yeah, I'm good.

40:42.151 --> 40:43.320
Good night.

41:24.695 --> 41:27.115
Mr. Dean? This area is off-limits.

41:27.116 --> 41:31.248
Vaughn, hi. I just wanted
to drop by and see Leslie.

41:31.249 --> 41:33.921
Aw, that's sweet, but she's not here,

41:33.922 --> 41:36.885
and you don't have access
to her private meditation suite.

41:36.886 --> 41:40.183
Hmm. I can't even check it out?

41:40.184 --> 41:41.393
See what she's done to the place?

41:41.394 --> 41:43.231
It must be pretty nice,

41:43.232 --> 41:45.903
considering how much time
she's been spending in there.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.992
And, hey, if Leslie's
allowed, then so am I.

41:48.993 --> 41:52.165
All due respect, Mr. Dean,
you're not Mrs. Dean.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.293
No.

41:55.214 --> 41:58.261
But when Mrs. Dean was
considering promoting you,

41:58.262 --> 42:00.098
who gave the idea a big thumbs up?

42:00.099 --> 42:04.148
Because you knew how devoted
I was to Mrs. Dean and her rules.

42:36.714 --> 42:37.716
[faint creak]

42:39.427 --> 42:40.639
Nico?

42:51.284 --> 42:56.043
Gert... can I sleep in here tonight?

42:56.044 --> 42:58.548
Alex said we're
not supposed to act weird.

42:58.549 --> 43:00.595
Dale and Stacey won't know.

43:10.657 --> 43:11.575
Gert...

43:14.288 --> 43:18.254
Something really weird
is going on with me.

43:18.255 --> 43:20.719
Yeah, I think it's going on
with all of us, Molls.

43:24.100 --> 43:27.272
Can you sing that song?
You know, the one you...

43:27.273 --> 43:29.611
Yeah, I know the one, Molls, just...

43:31.322 --> 43:32.909
It's been a really long time.

with Darius?

Right?

46:24.293 --> 46:25.963
Being down there with Darius...

46:28.426 --> 46:32.016
it made me realize how far I've come

46:32.017 --> 46:35.065
from my old life in so many ways.

46:36.568 --> 46:38.614

the skill set I brought to the table.

47:11.387 --> 47:14.894
community relations...

the police...
