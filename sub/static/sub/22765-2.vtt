00:08.999 --> 00:10.835
<i>Previously, on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:10.836 --> 00:12.965
I have a lot of things
I need to do today,

00:12.966 --> 00:14.677
like prepare for court

00:14.678 --> 00:17.056
and the PRIDE meeting
we are hosting tonight.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.185
- Don't remind me.
- You guys do realize

00:19.186 --> 00:21.983
that it's a volunteer charity
organization, right, not the mob?

00:21.984 --> 00:24.028
You could get out if you wanted to.

00:24.029 --> 00:26.283
[electronic voice] <i>The door</i>
<i>to Amy's room was opened.</i>

00:26.284 --> 00:27.828
You know the rules.

00:27.829 --> 00:29.832
- If Amy was here, she'd...
- But Amy is not here.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.460
So what does it matter
if I take her tights?

00:33.549 --> 00:35.594
I don't mean to interrupt.
I just wanted to tell

00:35.595 --> 00:37.179
Ms. Dean how grateful I am

00:37.180 --> 00:38.975
for everything
that her mother's done for me.

00:38.976 --> 00:41.438
This kind of delightful banter
is why I think we should all

00:41.439 --> 00:42.691
get together at my place tonight.

00:42.692 --> 00:44.152
You're having people over tonight?

00:44.153 --> 00:45.740
[screams]

00:47.451 --> 00:49.079
[metal creaking]

00:51.877 --> 00:53.087
[Nico] Room for one more?

00:59.266 --> 01:01.354
- [Karolina] I know that girl!
- Wait, don't!

01:02.439 --> 01:04.611
What the hell was that?

01:09.453 --> 01:11.247
- Hurry!
- What if they didn't see us?

01:11.248 --> 01:13.085
Well, then, we're getting in our cardio!

01:13.086 --> 01:14.504
They definitely saw something.

01:14.505 --> 01:16.050
- Way to go, Molly!
- I said sorry!

01:20.475 --> 01:22.311
There was some kind of flash of light.

01:22.312 --> 01:23.690
Or it could have been a reflection

01:23.691 --> 01:25.317
from the staff sound barrier.

01:25.318 --> 01:28.240
[Catherine] We have taken
every precaution, always.

01:28.241 --> 01:29.993
No reason to believe differently now.

01:29.994 --> 01:32.289
It's fine. It's gonna be fine.

01:32.290 --> 01:35.462
Shit! Which one of you guys
closed the door behind us?

01:35.463 --> 01:36.550
[Karolina] Are we trapped down here?

01:39.221 --> 01:41.600
God, it won't budge! It must be locked.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.395
[Chase] Don't take this
the wrong way, Wilder,

01:43.396 --> 01:45.860
but a little upper body strength
might help.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.073
[grunts]

01:49.074 --> 01:50.910
Heavier than it looks.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.331
Yeah, everyone, come on, push together.

01:53.332 --> 01:55.128
I hear footsteps.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.941
[all grunting]

02:09.364 --> 02:10.282
Let's keep moving.

02:13.498 --> 02:15.752
You guys into the guest house.
I have an idea.

02:15.753 --> 02:17.881
Yeah? What if it's a stupid idea
that makes things worse?

02:17.882 --> 02:19.383
[Gert] I don't see how that's possible.

02:19.384 --> 02:20.511
[Karolina] They could be
coming for us next.

02:20.512 --> 02:21.932
I trust you, Alex.

02:36.502 --> 02:39.675
It must've been some kind of Gibborim
ceremony for a higher level than me.

02:39.676 --> 02:41.427
That girl, Destiny, she's in the church.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.056
That's the only thing that makes sense.

02:43.057 --> 02:44.308
Are you kidding? That makes no sense.

02:44.309 --> 02:46.063
My parents are Jews, not Gibbs.

02:47.190 --> 02:48.776
But they are scientists.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.406
Maybe they were just doing
some cool experiment

02:51.407 --> 02:54.412
that involved stuffing
a human in a box...

02:54.413 --> 02:56.876
Look, the box kind of looked
like a transporter, right?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.754
My dad is obsessed with time travel.

02:58.755 --> 03:00.257
Maybe he finally figured it out.

03:00.258 --> 03:01.302
Great theory, Doc Brown.

03:04.308 --> 03:06.102
I'm sorry, Molly, are we boring you?

03:06.103 --> 03:08.649
Guys, whatever happened,

03:08.650 --> 03:11.363
I think our parents killed that girl.

04:40.124 --> 04:43.548
What happened to Amy Minoru
was an unthinkable tragedy...

04:45.426 --> 04:48.307
but it can't be the thing that
defines the rest of his life.

04:53.317 --> 04:54.946
He's a Wilder.

04:56.198 --> 05:00.540
He's strong. He's smart.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.920
We don't let our past define our future.

05:04.047 --> 05:05.465
You taught me that.

05:05.466 --> 05:06.761
I did.

05:12.857 --> 05:15.360
And you were in jail at the time,

05:15.361 --> 05:18.909
so I say I got some cred.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.205
I know better than to mess with you.

05:21.206 --> 05:24.420
- That's my man.
- Mm-hmm.

05:24.421 --> 05:27.009
Now, help me set up
for the PRIDE meeting.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.929
I'm gonna be in court all afternoon.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.100
Everyone will be here
on time this evening.

05:31.101 --> 05:33.689
[Chase] <i>It'll all be over soon.</i>

05:33.690 --> 05:35.735
In another year I'll be off to college,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.364
and I'll never have to see
his smug dickface again.

05:38.365 --> 05:40.243
Chase, he's your father.

05:40.244 --> 05:42.164
Oh, right. My bad.

05:42.165 --> 05:45.253
He slammed a fork into the table
this morning instead of my head.

05:45.254 --> 05:46.715
So, yeah, progress.

05:46.716 --> 05:49.511
He hasn't laid a finger
on you in a while now.

05:49.512 --> 05:52.517
Yeah, 'cause he knows if he
tried, I'd kick his ass.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.106
I'm not saying he isn't difficult,

05:55.107 --> 05:58.071
but that's the price
of having a mind like his.

05:58.072 --> 05:59.866
I love you, Mom,

05:59.867 --> 06:02.664
I do, but Dad is a first-class, grade-A,

06:02.665 --> 06:04.416
platinum-card-carrying asshole.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.878
That's his genius.

06:05.879 --> 06:08.884
[cell phone buzzes]

06:08.885 --> 06:10.888
Who's calling you?

06:10.889 --> 06:13.101
I thought Dad didn't
let you have friends.

06:13.102 --> 06:14.647
[scoffs]

06:19.322 --> 06:22.620
Hey, I'm supposed to call you, remember?

06:22.621 --> 06:25.084
No, no. It's good to hear your voice.

06:26.879 --> 06:28.465
I can't wait to see you tonight...

06:29.635 --> 06:30.887
even with him there.

06:32.432 --> 06:35.897
[whirring]

06:55.519 --> 06:57.775
[electrical buzzing]

07:08.713 --> 07:10.634
Goddamn it.

07:12.345 --> 07:13.848
Why are you still here?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.107
- [high-pitched whir]
- Aah!

07:19.693 --> 07:21.947
What's wrong? Is it the headaches again?

07:21.948 --> 07:24.201
It's the damn box.

07:24.202 --> 07:27.332
It's having dematerialization problems.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.965
Yes, I see that. But you'll
figure it out, right?

07:30.966 --> 07:33.261
The PRIDE meeting is tonight.

07:33.262 --> 07:36.100
Maybe you could reach out to someone?

07:36.101 --> 07:38.814
Fresh perspective might be good.

07:38.815 --> 07:40.108
[squeaking]

07:40.109 --> 07:42.320
It's okay to ask for help.

07:42.321 --> 07:44.702
Help? Is that a joke?

07:46.288 --> 07:48.375
Who could possibly be able to help me?

07:52.091 --> 07:57.685
I'm sorry, Janet, I'm just under
a tremendous amount of pressure,

07:57.686 --> 07:59.648
not that that's an excuse.

08:05.827 --> 08:07.622
Get rid of that.

08:07.623 --> 08:08.917
It's useless.

08:12.674 --> 08:14.761
[Karolina] There's a lot
going on with me, too,

08:14.762 --> 08:16.181
not that you would even notice.

08:19.479 --> 08:21.650
Leslie, we have a problem.

08:21.651 --> 08:25.825
It's Destiny. She wasn't in chapel
today, and she isn't in her room.

08:26.911 --> 08:27.955
Are you sure?

08:29.207 --> 08:31.962
We need to find her. Now.

08:31.963 --> 08:33.130
[laughter]

08:33.131 --> 08:35.009
Hey, Karolina, say hi to Phil.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.261
You remember my agent?

08:36.263 --> 08:38.057
Hey.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.063
I guess it has been a hot minute
since we last sat down,

08:41.063 --> 08:43.568
but you look great, Phil, really.

08:43.568 --> 08:46.407
You haven't aged a day
since I first signed with you.

08:46.408 --> 08:49.414
Oh, the one benefit of
looking 60 since I was 40.

08:52.546 --> 08:56.051
Is there a more private place
where we can talk?

08:56.052 --> 08:58.849
Secrets only live in shadows.

08:58.850 --> 09:01.520
And there are no shadows in the light.

09:01.521 --> 09:04.193
It's part of Leslie's sermon.

09:05.237 --> 09:06.781
So, what's going on?

09:06.782 --> 09:09.119
For you to drive all this way,
it must be big news,

09:09.120 --> 09:11.457
and let me just say the answer is yes!

09:11.458 --> 09:12.835
I am ready to do TV.

09:12.836 --> 09:15.842
Frank, I came here to let you go.

09:17.554 --> 09:18.472
What?

09:20.602 --> 09:22.145
You're firing me?

09:22.146 --> 09:24.610
Phil, I was one of your first clients.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.823
And also, you're my agent.

09:27.824 --> 09:30.161
You can't fire me. I fire you.

09:30.162 --> 09:32.792
Sure, that works, too.

09:32.793 --> 09:36.633
Listen, Frank, we had a hell of a run.

09:36.634 --> 09:39.096
There was a moment there
where your poster

09:39.097 --> 09:42.268
was on the wall of every teenaged
girl across the whole country.

09:42.269 --> 09:45.441
A huge swath of the female population

09:45.442 --> 09:49.366
discovered the wonders of
masturbation to your photo.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.495
High praise, indeed.

09:51.496 --> 09:56.214
Yeah, but now you're mostly known
as that guy from that church.

09:57.634 --> 09:59.846
And I say that as a compliment.

09:59.847 --> 10:01.933
Why are you even interested in acting?

10:01.934 --> 10:04.187
You make way more running this place

10:04.188 --> 10:07.611
than you ever could from doing
an arc on <i>Fuller House,</i>

10:07.612 --> 10:09.824
and this is tax-free.

10:09.825 --> 10:11.703
The church is Leslie's,

10:11.704 --> 10:15.126
and not that she isn't generous,
but I need my own thing.

10:15.127 --> 10:19.217
This whole place belongs
to Leslie? Jesus.

10:19.218 --> 10:23.267
Sorry. Who negotiated that deal?

10:23.268 --> 10:25.939
Her dad. Right before he died.

10:25.940 --> 10:29.446
But it was your celebrity that
helped put this place on the map.

10:29.447 --> 10:33.204
Talk to Leslie.
You deserve a piece of the pie,

10:33.205 --> 10:35.585
and the respect that goes with it.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.308
[Robert] <i>You need to fix this.</i>

10:44.561 --> 10:46.146
I know. I'm on it.

10:46.147 --> 10:50.155
I don't mean the trophy.
You do know what today is?

10:51.742 --> 10:53.913
Of course I do.

11:09.736 --> 11:12.491
[whooshing]

11:29.317 --> 11:31.194
I need you out of here.

11:31.195 --> 11:32.363
Now!

11:32.364 --> 11:33.700
Why?

11:33.701 --> 11:34.952
I made it clear.

11:34.953 --> 11:37.206
No one is supposed to be in here.

11:37.207 --> 11:41.256
And Nico made it clear that a
verbal contract is not enough.

11:41.257 --> 11:42.968
I'm sealing it off!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.723
Totally rational reaction.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.518
Out of the room, Robert.

11:47.519 --> 11:50.944
This is no way to deal
with the situation.

12:01.632 --> 12:03.301
Real mature, Tina.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.566
I did warn you.

12:13.071 --> 12:15.909
I know you miss her.

12:15.910 --> 12:17.746
I do, too.

12:17.747 --> 12:20.002
So why can't you just say it out loud?

12:27.726 --> 12:32.442
Every day, Nico pulls further away.

12:32.443 --> 12:38.163
If things don't change,
we'll lose her, too.

12:43.841 --> 12:46.387
I suppose we can start with a padlock.

12:57.242 --> 12:58.327
Good bran bar.

12:58.328 --> 13:00.081
- You like it?
- Yeah.

13:00.082 --> 13:02.085
- It's a new flavor.
- Thought you would.

13:02.086 --> 13:03.714
- Cinnamon? Booyah!
- Yes.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.886
- Hey!
- [honking]

13:06.887 --> 13:09.516
Can you believe this character? Yeah.

13:09.517 --> 13:14.067
Sorry! Can't go without mowing
down a bunch of children.

13:14.068 --> 13:17.950
I swear, the greener the car, the
bigger the A-hole driving it.

13:17.951 --> 13:21.414
If you see someone driving a Nemo,
just go in the other direction.

13:21.415 --> 13:23.920
Yeah, that goes double
for the dude who created it.

13:23.921 --> 13:25.799
- Dale...
- What, apologies.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.426
Is Victor Stein, I don't know,

13:27.427 --> 13:29.557
humanitarian of the year or something?

13:29.558 --> 13:31.434
- Yeah. Twice, actually.
- Oh, twice!

13:31.435 --> 13:34.190
And you need to be on your best
behavior when you see him tonight.

13:34.191 --> 13:36.904
Tonight? What are you talking about?
What's tonight?

13:36.905 --> 13:38.365
The PRIDE meeting.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.244
- Oh, God, no.
- Yeah.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.329
Are you serious?

13:41.330 --> 13:42.415
[honking]

13:42.416 --> 13:46.464
Okay, sorry! We hear you, guy!

13:46.465 --> 13:48.135
There he goes. There he goes. Okay!

13:48.136 --> 13:49.512
- You're a real strong man.
- Really!

13:49.513 --> 13:50.599
- Real strong man.
- Honestly!

13:50.600 --> 13:52.184
How about this?

13:52.185 --> 13:54.355
You go solo and you just cover for me?

13:54.356 --> 13:57.236
So only I have the pleasure
of listening to Tina Minoru

13:57.237 --> 13:58.907
insult my homemade brie?

13:58.908 --> 14:00.702
Well, she's insane,
because your soft cheeses

14:00.703 --> 14:01.913
are out of this world.

14:01.914 --> 14:04.627
- Thanks, hon.
- Love you.

14:04.628 --> 14:07.048
And if anyone should
get the night off, it's me,

14:07.049 --> 14:09.929
because I stayed up all night
in the basement with her.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.222
Honey!

14:11.223 --> 14:12.601
That's a good angle.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.748
Yeah? How's that?

15:05.749 --> 15:09.463
Well, you get to take
the rest of the day off,

15:09.464 --> 15:11.719
get some beers, see the kids.

15:13.138 --> 15:14.098
You all do!

15:15.769 --> 15:17.897
I'm the foreman now.

15:17.898 --> 15:22.907
You know, this job is being
bankrolled by some powerful people.

15:22.908 --> 15:24.493
They're not gonna like this.

15:24.494 --> 15:27.415
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

15:27.416 --> 15:31.507
Oh, and when you call Geoffrey Wilder,

15:31.508 --> 15:34.180
tell him Darius Davis says hello.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.583
[cell phone rings]

15:48.584 --> 15:49.878
Wilder. What's up?

15:52.133 --> 15:56.766
No. No, whatever you do,
don't call the cops.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.102
I'll handle it.

15:58.103 --> 15:59.730
Handle what?

15:59.731 --> 16:02.318
It's Howard from the construction site.

16:02.319 --> 16:05.576
It seems Darius Davis showed up
there and made himself at home.

16:05.577 --> 16:07.370
He's just trying to get my attention.

16:07.371 --> 16:10.042
Well, it worked. Make Darius go away.

16:10.043 --> 16:12.380
If I pay him,
he'll keep coming back for more.

16:12.381 --> 16:16.180
And if you don't?
He's trying to pull you back in.

16:16.181 --> 16:18.184
It's too late for that.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.729
You know this.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.943
If the PRIDE find out?

16:22.944 --> 16:26.325
Nothing can jeopardize
that construction site.

16:26.326 --> 16:27.579
Understood.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.211
I got this.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.613
Leslie.

16:46.742 --> 16:47.910
You're leaving?

16:47.911 --> 16:49.454
I'm sorry.

16:49.455 --> 16:51.876
I know how much
you've done for me, but...

16:51.877 --> 16:54.215
No goodbye, not even a note?

16:56.344 --> 16:58.473
Look, there's something
that I never told you.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.317
I have a little girl.

17:04.318 --> 17:07.031
Today's her birthday. She's three.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.913
I swore to myself that
I wouldn't miss another one.

17:11.207 --> 17:13.294
You said you didn't have anyone.

17:13.295 --> 17:14.839
Because I don't.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.720
Not anymore, not after I ran.

17:17.721 --> 17:20.642
I mean, I just couldn't
take care of her,

17:20.643 --> 17:22.939
not like she deserved...

17:24.275 --> 17:27.195
but I'm doing better now,

17:27.196 --> 17:30.830
you know, I'm ready,
and that is all thanks to you.

17:37.509 --> 17:40.891
Thank you, Destiny...

17:40.892 --> 17:44.774
and what better expression
of your growth in the church

17:44.775 --> 17:50.034
than re-embracing your role as a mother.

17:50.035 --> 17:55.419
But... maybe you could wait a few days?

17:55.420 --> 17:57.883
- Why?
- I wanted it to be a surprise,

17:57.884 --> 18:01.684
but obviously I've made it
a little too surprising.

18:03.771 --> 18:05.148
I've been praying on it...

18:07.069 --> 18:09.866
and I believe that you are ready
to move up in the church...

18:10.952 --> 18:12.788
to see more of the spectrum.

18:12.789 --> 18:14.082
You don't mean...

18:14.083 --> 18:15.001
Yes.

18:17.172 --> 18:19.301
I believe you're ready to go Ultra.

18:21.890 --> 18:22.976
Tonight.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.776
All of the plans have been made.

18:27.777 --> 18:31.117
You just... need to come with me.

18:32.369 --> 18:34.373
[man] Bus 45 is now boarding!

18:37.004 --> 18:39.926
Do you really think that I'm ready?

18:43.726 --> 18:44.644
I do.

18:49.111 --> 18:50.823
Come on.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.620
Let's go do this.

18:53.621 --> 18:54.790
Okay.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.443
Looking sharp!

19:51.444 --> 19:54.032
Mr. Wilder! Ha!

19:54.033 --> 19:56.913
Well, now, fellas, this is an honor.

19:56.914 --> 20:02.173
Once upon a time,
this badass ran this town.

20:02.174 --> 20:04.678
Easy, now. You'll make me feel old.

20:04.679 --> 20:05.890
[chuckles]

20:10.357 --> 20:11.359
Check him.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.256
You get it back when we done.

20:23.257 --> 20:26.262
Make sure there's no recording
of this negotiation.

20:26.263 --> 20:28.100
That's what we calling this?

20:28.101 --> 20:31.607
Well, when you build a new
school in my 'hood, homie,

20:31.608 --> 20:33.361
there's taxes to pay.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.712
Mm...

20:43.297 --> 20:45.051
Yeah, I don't hear any ticking.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.476
[sighs] But Geoffrey...

20:52.190 --> 20:54.194
but it doesn't feel like 50 grand.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.198
Open it.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.192
You notice anything familiar?

21:14.193 --> 21:18.283
If I'm not mistaken,
that's your Nana B's house.

21:18.284 --> 21:21.039
Ooh, she made the best spicy chicken.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.503
Shit kept me alive for years.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.969
If you keep messing with me,

21:27.970 --> 21:30.643
that chicken recipe's gonna be
all that's left of her.

21:39.118 --> 21:40.954
Here I thought you'd gone soft

21:40.955 --> 21:45.964
with your yoga moms and fro-yo and shit.

21:45.965 --> 21:48.554
Guess you still got some
rollin' 20s in you after all.

21:49.639 --> 21:51.224
For life, cuz.

21:51.225 --> 21:55.149
Now that I moved on,
you the boss now, I get that,

21:55.150 --> 21:59.408
but don't forget you got what you
did because I let you have it.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.833
If I want it back, I'll take it.

22:03.834 --> 22:10.095
See, the way I recall it, you got
to the top because of what I did.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.223
For you.

22:12.350 --> 22:14.563
All you do is take.

22:14.564 --> 22:17.527
You ain't got no respect, no honor,

22:17.528 --> 22:20.032
no memory of the people
you left behind, cuz.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.580
I'm building something great
for this community!

22:26.671 --> 22:29.343
You're building something great
for Geoffrey Wilder...

22:31.848 --> 22:33.351
just like always.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.692
I want you gone and never coming back,

22:37.693 --> 22:41.408
or I will destroy your world.

22:42.912 --> 22:46.836
Phone. I gotta tell the crew
break time is over.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.815
You got what you needed from his cell?

23:21.238 --> 23:23.366
Download complete.

23:23.367 --> 23:24.537
Word.

23:33.429 --> 23:34.389
Leslie?

23:53.970 --> 23:55.973
Don't let me interrupt.

23:55.974 --> 23:59.981
I just came in for some moral support.

23:59.982 --> 24:02.987
I appreciate that, but this is
my home office. I'm working.

24:02.988 --> 24:05.535
You're always working.

24:05.536 --> 24:08.541
Let me help you lighten the load.

24:08.542 --> 24:12.507
I'm ready to go all in,
to devote myself entirely.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.764
Take me Ultra.

24:18.645 --> 24:20.313
You know what that entails.

24:20.314 --> 24:21.483
Yes, I do...

24:22.736 --> 24:26.952
devotion of body and soul.

24:26.953 --> 24:29.708
For too long, I've had one
foot in and one foot out,

24:29.709 --> 24:32.422
and this church is too much for
one person to run on their own.

24:34.134 --> 24:36.095
It drove your father
into an early grave,

24:36.096 --> 24:38.851
and I don't want to see
that happen to you.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.520
He had testicular cancer, Frank.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.734
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem for me.

24:42.735 --> 24:47.284
I know in the past my acting
has taken me away from my faith,

24:47.285 --> 24:52.587
but now, the only part that
I want to play is your partner,

24:52.588 --> 24:54.592
both in life and the church.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.514
Let us pray.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.233
Your agent came by today.
What did he have to say?

25:03.234 --> 25:07.116
Forget Phil. I want to do
something that matters.

25:10.791 --> 25:12.585
I can't have
this conversation right now.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.673
Where do you have to go
that's more important than this?

25:14.674 --> 25:16.008
The PRIDE meeting.

25:16.009 --> 25:18.639
Perfect. Let me come with you.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.185
The meetings are closed.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.275
So your billionaire buddies
are more important

25:24.276 --> 25:26.823
than your marriage or the church?

25:31.373 --> 25:34.253
Those billionaires legitimize the church

25:34.254 --> 25:36.340
in the eyes of the city.

25:36.341 --> 25:38.762
What I do for PRIDE,
I do for the church.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.266
What about me, Leslie?

25:43.522 --> 25:47.442
The fact that you're even
toying with going Ultra

25:47.443 --> 25:50.871
is very exciting, and we'll
talk about it later.

25:52.498 --> 25:55.504
I'm not toying, Leslie. I'm serious.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.942
She's a very strong candidate.

26:15.294 --> 26:17.548
Is there a problem?

26:17.549 --> 26:20.428
The less I know
about this shit, the better.

26:20.429 --> 26:23.017
Everyone signs off on this.
We're all in this together.

26:23.018 --> 26:25.940
You're not getting cold feet,
are you, Geoffrey?

26:25.941 --> 26:29.154
It concerns me that you aren't.
She's only 17.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.783
They're always the same age.

26:30.784 --> 26:33.329
Which is now the same age
as our children.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.125
That don't bother nobody?

26:35.126 --> 26:36.920
Personally, I've found denial

26:36.921 --> 26:39.258
to be a very effective coping mechanism.

26:39.259 --> 26:41.888
I know how I feel about Chardonnay.

26:41.889 --> 26:43.976
What has gotten into you?

26:43.977 --> 26:47.357
These kids are living on borrowed time.

26:47.358 --> 26:50.447
When they come to me,
they are addicts on the streets.

26:50.448 --> 26:53.746
The six months of safety
and shelter that I give them

26:53.747 --> 26:56.960
is more than they would have
if left on their own.

26:56.961 --> 26:58.714
This is a gift, and the cause

26:58.715 --> 27:01.302
that they are giving
themselves over to...

27:01.303 --> 27:03.766
...is one they know nothing about.

27:03.767 --> 27:05.853
Not so different from us, then.

27:05.854 --> 27:07.940
[Janet] We know why we're here,

27:07.941 --> 27:10.195
and if everything goes as planned...

27:10.196 --> 27:12.115
which, of course, it will...

27:12.116 --> 27:14.872
...then this is the last time
any of us have to be here.

27:17.376 --> 27:18.588

30:15.107 --> 30:16.358
There you go.

30:16.359 --> 30:19.407
[shushing]

30:24.500 --> 30:25.920
Please don't do this.

30:28.258 --> 30:29.176
Please.

30:33.476 --> 30:36.482
[individual beeps, then rapid beeps]

30:48.549 --> 30:50.302
Why can't I feel my arms?

30:51.680 --> 30:52.933
My legs...

30:58.151 --> 30:59.362
What is this?

31:01.115 --> 31:02.325
It's the light.

31:02.326 --> 31:04.245
- What happens?
- It's okay.

31:04.246 --> 31:08.380
- Please don't.
- Destiny, it's okay. It's okay.

31:09.465 --> 31:10.634
I'm sorry.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.180
Please... No, no, no, no!

31:13.181 --> 31:14.265
Please!

31:14.266 --> 31:15.351
Please, don't!

31:15.352 --> 31:18.900
[sobbing]

31:18.901 --> 31:21.656
Leslie, I'm afraid!

31:21.657 --> 31:23.158
You don't have to be afraid.

31:23.159 --> 31:25.540
Please! Please, I'm afraid!

31:28.838 --> 31:31.259
No, no, no, no! No, no!

31:34.683 --> 31:36.018
I'm afraid!

31:36.019 --> 31:38.858
- Do it. Now.
- Please.

31:40.653 --> 31:42.280
It's okay.

31:42.281 --> 31:43.743
It's gonna be okay, sweet girl.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.618
[Victor] She's gone.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.313
[zips]

32:21.400 --> 32:22.319
I trust you, Alex.

32:39.186 --> 32:40.939
- It worked.
- You cut the power?

32:40.940 --> 32:43.778
My parents just figured it out.
I was covering the flash.

32:43.779 --> 32:45.824
Maybe it'll seem like a circuit blew.

32:45.825 --> 32:48.705
- More like your dumb idea did.
- It's actually really smart.

32:48.706 --> 32:51.501
But we can't just stand around here
like something weird just happened.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.088
I have an idea.

32:53.089 --> 32:55.177
Does that involve waking Molly?

33:03.903 --> 33:06.658
- Okay, baby, hey, be cool.
- Yeah.

33:10.917 --> 33:13.253
...is that your arm in my leg?

33:13.254 --> 33:15.550
Hey, guys, look who showed up.

33:15.551 --> 33:17.094
How was the meeting?

33:17.095 --> 33:20.309
Uh, good, good, just wrapping up.

33:20.310 --> 33:22.313
We heard you guys weren't coming.

33:22.314 --> 33:23.942
Hope it's okay.

33:23.943 --> 33:26.279
Turns out we missed each other
more than we cared to admit.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.242
So, then, everything's good here?

33:28.243 --> 33:30.956
I wouldn't say that.
Nico just landed on green,

33:30.957 --> 33:33.836
so things are about
to get a little freaky.

33:33.837 --> 33:37.176
Oh, my God!

33:37.177 --> 33:41.518
Okay, then, we'll let
you guys get to it.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.818
Parents are leaving soon,
if you kids need rides.

33:50.705 --> 33:53.209
- You think they saw anything?
- I think we're good here.

33:55.631 --> 33:57.635
Game over.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.264
Think they bought it?

34:00.265 --> 34:02.393
[Tina] Our kids are here?

34:02.394 --> 34:06.401
They're in the guest house
playing games like old times.

34:06.402 --> 34:08.237
Didn't seem to have a clue.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.326
Also like old times.

34:10.327 --> 34:12.163
Frankly, it was nice to see.

34:12.164 --> 34:14.918
Breakers are all flipped.
Something must've blown.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.591
- Victor's box.
- Put on quite a show tonight.

34:17.592 --> 34:18.676
It did its job.

34:18.677 --> 34:19.969
Though I'm not sure why it

34:19.971 --> 34:21.389
would cause a power surge.

34:21.389 --> 34:23.351
It's not like it's plugged into a wall.

34:23.353 --> 34:27.275
It's a lot of energy swirling around.
Who knows.

34:27.277 --> 34:29.364
Whatever it was, don't think

34:29.364 --> 34:31.870
it had anything to do with the kids.

34:33.039 --> 34:34.583
You okay?

34:37.339 --> 34:39.385
- That was a hard one.
- Agreed.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.647
If everyone's good here,

34:45.648 --> 34:47.902
I have to be in the office early.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.338
Want some help with that thing?

34:58.339 --> 35:00.720
No, you guys go on.
I can pack up myself.

35:07.315 --> 35:09.737
There's no way my parents
would kill someone, all right,

35:09.738 --> 35:11.156
especially an innocent girl.

35:11.157 --> 35:12.868
My parents fight for people like her.

35:12.869 --> 35:15.038
Yeah, so does mine,
and Destiny loved her.

35:15.039 --> 35:17.836
She asked for my number.
She wants to hang out.

35:17.837 --> 35:20.424
She... she can't be... dead.

35:20.425 --> 35:25.434
Here's an idea. How about we just
march down there and ask them?

35:25.435 --> 35:27.271
'Cause finding out my mom is evil

35:27.272 --> 35:29.902
would actually be the least
surprising explanation.

35:29.903 --> 35:32.323
But the rest of our parents
were down there, too.

35:32.324 --> 35:33.910
So you're saying they're all psycho?

35:33.911 --> 35:35.789
Actually describes my dad pretty well.

35:35.790 --> 35:38.460
[Gert] No way. Dale and
Stacey may have their quirks,

35:38.461 --> 35:40.840
but their biggest character flaw
is that they occasionally

35:40.841 --> 35:42.969
listen to Weird Al for pleasure.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.141
Molly, let me see that photo you took.

36:07.728 --> 36:09.983
[thumping on door]

36:34.741 --> 36:36.828
[thumping]

36:56.408 --> 36:58.829
[Destiny gasping]

36:58.830 --> 37:00.792
Please! Please!

37:00.793 --> 37:04.215
You shouldn't be here.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.426
Help me!

37:08.391 --> 37:11.188
[chatter]

37:34.317 --> 37:36.697
All right, we need
to maintain the status quo.

37:36.698 --> 37:38.659
If we start acting weird,
they're gonna notice.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.245
If I don't act weird, they'll notice.

37:40.246 --> 37:42.207
We just need to buy ourselves some time.

37:42.208 --> 37:44.796
Right, there's gotta be a reasonable
explanation for all this.

37:44.797 --> 37:46.675
Right, like time travel.

37:46.676 --> 37:48.012
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

37:49.974 --> 37:52.771
Okay! Great party, kids.

37:52.772 --> 37:55.818
Anybody want some brie to take home?

37:55.819 --> 37:57.279
Seems to be a lot left over.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.657
I wonder why.

37:58.658 --> 38:00.118
Okay. Gert, Molly,

38:00.119 --> 38:01.706
why don't you guys come with us?

38:02.958 --> 38:05.212
Act normal.

38:05.213 --> 38:07.676
Sounds super! Thanks so much.

38:09.764 --> 38:12.310
You've never sounded that happy
in your entire life.

38:14.481 --> 38:18.446
Karolina, it's late. Everyone's
had a long day. Ready?

38:18.447 --> 38:20.660
Great to see you guys.

38:20.661 --> 38:21.830
Drive safe.

38:23.332 --> 38:24.668
Hey.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.800
Thank you... for everything tonight.

38:30.597 --> 38:32.560
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

38:35.732 --> 38:38.153
Your dad texted.
He's outside in the Leapfrog.

38:38.154 --> 38:41.075
Ah, Nemo's new self-driving SUV.

38:41.076 --> 38:43.998
Extra-large trunk space.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.334
We can't leave him waiting.

38:46.713 --> 38:47.798
I wouldn't dream of it.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.807
Alex, where is Nico?

38:52.808 --> 38:54.769
I have a board meeting
first thing tomorrow.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.441
Um, she's freshening up.

38:57.442 --> 38:58.695
I'll tell her you're waiting.

39:00.364 --> 39:01.950
[knock on door]

39:01.951 --> 39:04.998
Nico? It's just me.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.963
Hey. They're starting to get suspicious.

39:18.275 --> 39:19.904
I can't go home.

39:22.367 --> 39:24.705
It was already bad enough
living there, but...

39:26.416 --> 39:27.752
now...

39:27.753 --> 39:28.963
I know. I get it.

39:28.964 --> 39:30.007
No, Alex, you don't.

39:31.970 --> 39:32.888
You can't.

39:36.019 --> 39:39.149
It's always just been you
and your parents,

39:39.150 --> 39:41.488
but I used to have someone...

39:43.910 --> 39:45.871
who'd take my side,

39:45.872 --> 39:47.000
listen to me.

39:50.841 --> 39:52.510
And now I'm all alone...

39:55.057 --> 39:56.226
with them.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.274
You're not alone.

40:00.359 --> 40:01.361
Promise.

40:04.869 --> 40:06.037
[Alex] Hey, guys.

40:06.038 --> 40:08.542
- There she is.
- Finally.

40:08.543 --> 40:11.422
Thanks for everything,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilder.

40:11.423 --> 40:12.843
Have a great night.

40:25.994 --> 40:28.289
Seems like everything
turned around after all.

40:28.290 --> 40:30.961
You and Nico, did I see some sparks?

40:30.962 --> 40:34.886
'Cause I thought I saw some sparks.

40:34.887 --> 40:38.518
Hey, the old man had
some game back in the day,

40:38.519 --> 40:40.188
if you ever need some advice.

40:40.189 --> 40:42.150
Yeah, I'm good.

40:42.151 --> 40:43.320
Good night.

40:58.643 --> 41:00.271
[beeps]

41:06.324 --> 41:08.203
[beeps]

41:10.082 --> 41:12.420
[beeps]

41:16.971 --> 41:18.766
[beeps]

41:19.852 --> 41:21.689
[beeps]

41:24.695 --> 41:27.115
Mr. Dean? This area is off-limits.

41:27.116 --> 41:31.248
Vaughn, hi. I just wanted
to drop by and see Leslie.

41:31.249 --> 41:33.921
Aw, that's sweet, but she's not here,

41:33.922 --> 41:36.885
and you don't have access
to her private meditation suite.

41:36.886 --> 41:40.183
Hmm. I can't even check it out?

41:40.184 --> 41:41.393
See what she's done to the place?

41:41.394 --> 41:43.231
It must be pretty nice,

41:43.232 --> 41:45.903
considering how much time
she's been spending in there.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.992
And, hey, if Leslie's
allowed, then so am I.

41:48.993 --> 41:52.165
All due respect, Mr. Dean,
you're not Mrs. Dean.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.293
No.

41:55.214 --> 41:58.261
But when Mrs. Dean was
considering promoting you,

41:58.262 --> 42:00.098
who gave the idea a big thumbs up?

42:00.099 --> 42:04.148
Because you knew how devoted
I was to Mrs. Dean and her rules.

42:36.714 --> 42:37.716
[faint creak]

42:39.427 --> 42:40.639
Nico?

42:51.284 --> 42:56.043
Gert... can I sleep in here tonight?

42:56.044 --> 42:58.548
Alex said we're
not supposed to act weird.

42:58.549 --> 43:00.595
Dale and Stacey won't know.

43:10.657 --> 43:11.575
Gert...

43:14.288 --> 43:18.254
Something really weird
is going on with me.

43:18.255 --> 43:20.719
Yeah, I think it's going on
with all of us, Molls.

43:24.100 --> 43:27.272
Can you sing that song?
You know, the one you...

43:27.273 --> 43:29.611
Yeah, I know the one, Molls, just...

43:31.322 --> 43:32.909
It's been a really long time.

43:34.663 --> 43:37.544
Please. Please sing.

43:41.176 --> 43:45.100
â™ª Let's go to sleep â™ª

43:46.352 --> 43:49.901
â™ª There is a dream â™ª

43:49.902 --> 43:53.241
â™ª We can share â™ª

43:56.791 --> 44:00.632
â™ª Just you and me â™ª

44:02.134 --> 44:06.058
<i>â™ª In a floating sea â™ª</i>

44:06.059 --> 44:08.898
<i>â™ª In the air â™ª</i>

44:13.114 --> 44:15.954
<i>â™ª What's left below â™ª</i>

44:17.373 --> 44:19.085
<i>â™ª I'll never know â™ª</i>

44:42.632 --> 44:45.429
Honey, don't stay out here
too late, okay?

44:46.724 --> 44:47.642
I won't.

44:54.238 --> 44:57.411
<i>â™ª You are the moon â™ª</i>

44:59.206 --> 45:03.590
<i>â™ª In a quiet night â™ª</i>

45:03.591 --> 45:06.805
â™ª Terrified â™ª

45:09.978 --> 45:14.195
â™ª Reach for the cloud â™ª

45:15.322 --> 45:19.245
<i>â™ª I will be around â™ª</i>

45:19.246 --> 45:22.796
<i>â™ª And by your side... â™ª</i>

45:26.219 --> 45:29.935
<i>[singing continues, distorted]</i>

45:48.597 --> 45:49.766
I was worried about you.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.416
Everything go okay today...

46:03.544 --> 46:04.588
with Darius?

46:06.550 --> 46:07.927
We'll break ground on time.

46:10.265 --> 46:12.644
Nothing knocks that dig off schedule,

46:12.645 --> 46:14.023
especially him.

46:15.777 --> 46:17.321
That's great news.

46:19.366 --> 46:20.327
Right?

46:24.293 --> 46:25.963
Being down there with Darius...

46:28.426 --> 46:32.016
it made me realize how far I've come

46:32.017 --> 46:35.065
from my old life in so many ways.

46:36.568 --> 46:38.614
That's a good thing.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.078
But what we did tonight...

46:42.079 --> 46:45.251
the zip code may have changed,

46:45.252 --> 46:48.843
and, yeah, I traded my old crew
for some rich white folk...

46:52.725 --> 46:55.981
Killing is still killing.

46:55.982 --> 46:57.569
Come on, now, Geoffrey.

47:00.282 --> 47:03.328
We can't think of it that way.

47:03.329 --> 47:05.207
It's not like I didn't understand

47:05.208 --> 47:07.629
the skill set I brought to the table.

47:07.630 --> 47:11.386
Yeah. Real estate holdings,

47:11.387 --> 47:14.894
community relations...

47:14.895 --> 47:17.190
ties to the mayor's office,
the police...

47:17.191 --> 47:19.111
It's more than that, and you know it.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.340
Today is done.

47:38.358 --> 47:39.611
Let's go to bed.
