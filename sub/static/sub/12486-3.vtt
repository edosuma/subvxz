WEBVTT

00:03.484 --> 00:05.600
Good morning, all!

00:05.601 --> 00:10.641
And welcome to your first
day at my new school!

00:11.392 --> 00:14.982
I am waiting because I was
expecting you to applaud.

00:14.983 --> 00:17.296
(All applauding)

00:17.297 --> 00:20.233
Please, you're too kind.

00:20.234 --> 00:26.005
I am Zoltan Grundy, as you probably
know, because I am extremely famous.

00:26.006 --> 00:29.798
And because you've all
met me several times.

00:29.799 --> 00:33.772
I have emailed all of you your class
schedules and assignments for this week.

00:33.773 --> 00:35.993
(Clapping)

00:37.484 --> 00:41.287
No? Not now? Okay, I'm sorry, go on.

00:41.288 --> 00:45.091
I will be providing you with
excellent facilities and teachers,

00:45.092 --> 00:49.932
and I expect nothing less
than excellence in return.

00:49.933 --> 00:52.198
And applause.

00:52.199 --> 00:54.367
But not now.

00:54.368 --> 00:58.171
So, does anyone have any questions?

00:58.172 --> 01:02.375
I have a question. Have
you seen my retainer?

01:02.376 --> 01:06.312
Interesting question. No, I have not.

01:06.313 --> 01:09.248
I have a question. Have
you checked in your mouth?

01:09.249 --> 01:14.289
I have a question. How
dumb do you think I am?

01:15.422 --> 01:20.359
Don't you think I would know if
my retainer were in my own mouth?

01:20.360 --> 01:23.096
It's in your mouth.

01:23.097 --> 01:25.857
This isn't mine.

01:26.266 --> 01:29.026
It's Fletcher's.

01:30.104 --> 01:32.504
Not anymore.

01:33.073 --> 01:38.144
Excuse me, Mr. Grundy, but I have
an actual meaningful question.

01:38.145 --> 01:41.614
When will we be receiving the student
handbook covering the rules of the school,

01:41.615 --> 01:43.092
like what is our curfew,

01:43.093 --> 01:47.153
and what's the maximum number of
stuffed animals we can have on our beds?

01:47.154 --> 01:50.123
Please be more than twelve.
Please be more than twelve.

01:50.124 --> 01:52.325
There is no rule book.

01:52.326 --> 01:55.094
You are the best and
brightest of your generation,

01:55.095 --> 01:58.498
and I trust you all to figure
things out for yourselves.

01:58.499 --> 02:03.369
And if you can't, I will
simply replace you with robots.

02:03.370 --> 02:05.590
(Laughing)

02:06.406 --> 02:08.661
I'm kidding, of course.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.211
That technology won't
be ready for weeks.

02:12.212 --> 02:16.382
Wait, so the only rule
is there are no rules?

02:16.383 --> 02:18.326
This no-rules rule,

02:18.327 --> 02:23.122
while logically inconsistent, is
the greatest non-rule rule ever!

02:23.123 --> 02:28.127
So you're saying that instead of having to
go to bed at 8:30 like my parents make me.

02:28.128 --> 02:34.028
I can go to bed whenever I
want, like 8:15, or even 8:00!

02:34.168 --> 02:36.135
I'm going to get ready for bed.

02:36.136 --> 02:37.270
But it's not even noon.

02:37.271 --> 02:40.306
I know, but I'm feeling a little crazy!

02:40.307 --> 02:42.107
Rules be darned!

02:42.108 --> 02:44.633
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

02:44.634 --> 02:47.876
<i>♪Ooh, ooh. Ooh. Doo, doo.</i>

02:47.877 --> 02:50.680
<i>♪Ooh, ooh. Ooh. Doo, doo.</i>

02:50.681 --> 02:51.629
Woo!

02:51.630 --> 02:53.345
<i>♪Everybody's got that thing.</i>

02:53.346 --> 02:55.335
<i>♪Something different, we all bring.</i>

02:55.336 --> 02:57.118
<i>♪Don't you let 'em, clip your wings.</i>

02:57.119 --> 02:58.888
<i>♪You got it! You got it!</i>

02:58.889 --> 03:02.414
<i>♪We're on fire and we
blaze, in extraordinary ways.</i>

03:06.098 --> 03:09.558
<i>♪You can dream it. You can be it.</i>

03:09.559 --> 03:13.872
<i>♪If you can feel

03:13.873 --> 03:17.673

03:28.890 --> 03:32.370

03:32.906 --> 03:34.766
Woo!

03:40.423 --> 03:43.492
I hate this stupid phone!

03:43.493 --> 03:45.427
Excuse me, Lexi.

03:45.428 --> 03:47.362
I couldn't help overhearing.

03:47.363 --> 03:50.599
Because my overhearing
aid was turned on.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.268
- What's wrong with your phone?
- Everything!

03:53.269 --> 03:54.540
If it's a smart phone,

03:54.541 --> 03:57.539
why isn't it smart enough to block
messages from boys who aren't cute?

03:57.540 --> 03:59.043
Ah.

03:59.044 --> 04:01.884
Actually, we tried
that with the Z-Phone 2.

04:01.885 --> 04:06.214
But I could never get
through to my mother.

04:06.215 --> 04:10.385
It should also block messages from
my boyfriend-slash-ex-boyfriend, Chad.

04:10.386 --> 04:14.389
I'm confused. Is he your
boyfriend or your ex-boyfriend?

04:14.390 --> 04:16.658
Both. We have a love-hate relationship.

04:16.659 --> 04:21.430
All the other girls hate that I'm
going out with him, and I love that.

04:21.430 --> 04:22.519
Fascinating.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.234
You could give me a real insight
into the psyche of the young consumer.

04:26.235 --> 04:29.270
I was so advanced as a child, I
never really got to be a teenager.

04:29.271 --> 04:33.642
But I've done extensive reading
on the teenage experience.

04:33.643 --> 04:35.677
So this Chad.

04:35.678 --> 04:39.458
Is he a Vampire or a Werewolf?

04:40.450 --> 04:43.938
Hey, kid. Have you seen Mr. Grundy?

04:43.939 --> 04:45.888
- Hmm, actually, he's...
- Never mind. Found him.

04:45.889 --> 04:49.290
He's right behind your face.

04:49.291 --> 04:53.788
Mr. Grundy, here are the financial
reports for the Hashimoto Soda deal.

04:53.789 --> 04:57.108
I did them entirely on my
own, with no help from anyone.

04:57.109 --> 05:01.336
Unless you hate them, in which case
it was Lotterstein from accounting.

05:01.337 --> 05:05.640
Lexi, this is my vice-president
of acquisitions, Winter Maddox.

05:05.641 --> 05:11.461
She's in charge of acquisitions
and she bought that outfit?

05:11.481 --> 05:13.314
Do you need a tissue?

05:13.315 --> 05:17.028
Obviously, you're quite snotty.

05:17.029 --> 05:21.656
Anyway, shall we discuss the deal, and then
my well-deserved and overdue promotion?

05:21.657 --> 05:25.184
Sorry, I have more important
things to deal with right now.

05:25.185 --> 05:27.818
Did you know that it was the
one-week anniversary of Lexi's

05:27.819 --> 05:31.656
new haircut and Chad didn't
even send her flowers?

05:31.657 --> 05:35.857
You just don't do that to a person!

05:41.410 --> 05:43.277
No rules! How cool is that?

05:43.278 --> 05:46.648
I know! Check it out! Look
how close I am to the TV!

05:46.649 --> 05:49.317
Hope I don't ruin my eyes!

05:49.318 --> 05:50.303
What are you watching?

05:50.304 --> 05:54.255
I have no idea, because I can't see
anything and I have a huge headache.

05:54.256 --> 05:56.658
But this is awesome.

05:56.659 --> 06:00.562
I've been thinking about this no rules
thing and I don't think it's a good idea.

06:00.563 --> 06:04.099
You see, over the years I've
read dozens of parenting books,

06:04.100 --> 06:07.468
you know, to train my mom and dad how
to raise me to be the perfect child.

06:07.469 --> 06:11.305
- And what went wrong?
- Zip it, Fletcher!

06:11.306 --> 06:16.377
As I was saying, all the experts agree
that children need rules to feel secure.

06:16.378 --> 06:21.302
So I've taken the liberty of writing
a little student rule book for us.

06:21.303 --> 06:23.163
Dah!

06:23.947 --> 06:26.555
Olive, Mr. Grundy said
we don't need a rule book.

06:26.556 --> 06:29.223
No, what he said was,
there was no rule book,

06:29.224 --> 06:31.908
implying of course that we
should write one ourselves.

06:31.909 --> 06:33.261
So behold;

06:33.262 --> 06:36.497
Our "Ten Thousand Commandments"!

06:36.498 --> 06:39.061
There are actually 13,629

06:39.062 --> 06:41.402
but "Ten Thousand Commandments"

06:41.403 --> 06:44.763
has a better ring to it.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.376
Olive, these rules are ridiculous.

06:48.377 --> 06:51.546
Yeah, like rule number 79; "No
eating with your mouth open".

06:51.547 --> 06:53.789
How are we supposed to
get the food in there?

06:53.790 --> 06:56.250
See rule 80.

06:56.318 --> 06:58.420
"Rule 80;

06:58.421 --> 07:02.561
No asking stupid questions, Fletcher".

07:04.594 --> 07:08.660
Olive, you're not the boss of us.
We're not going to follow your rules.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.135
Fine. You and Fletcher
can live in anarchy,

07:11.136 --> 07:14.469
and Angus and I will live in civility,
and we'll see who does better.

07:14.470 --> 07:17.438
Wait. Why do I have to follow the rules?

07:17.439 --> 07:20.609
Because you're madly in love with me,
and you'll do whatever I tell you to.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.980
Right. (Chuckling)

07:22.981 --> 07:25.561
What she said.

07:25.824 --> 07:28.253
Okay, Olive. You want to
throw down the gauntlet?

07:28.254 --> 07:29.900
Let's throw down the gauntlet.

07:29.901 --> 07:33.248
Sorry, but rule number 27 strictly
prohibits the throwing of a gauntlet,

07:33.249 --> 07:37.291
a party, a football, a javelin, a punch,
a bone, a tantrum, a banana cream pie,

07:37.292 --> 07:41.496
a monkey wrench into things, a momma from
a train, or a baby out with the bath water.

07:41.497 --> 07:42.545
Argh!

07:42.546 --> 07:45.366
Oh, and you also can't throw
your hands up in frustration.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.227
Ugh!

07:51.031 --> 07:55.329
Check this out. Chad just texted
me a picture of him and Nicole.

07:55.330 --> 07:59.247
Followed by a text that says, "sorry,
I sent this to you by accident".

07:59.248 --> 08:02.188
That is totes cray!

08:02.977 --> 08:05.510
Sorry to interrupt your little party.

08:05.511 --> 08:07.736
Not as sorry as we are.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.287
(Sing-song) Roasted!

08:10.288 --> 08:15.226
Mr. Grundy, we have a video conference
with Mr. Hashimoto about the deal.

08:15.227 --> 08:18.329
Not now. Lexi and I need to figure
out what to text back to Chad.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.497
How about T-T-Y-N?

08:20.498 --> 08:22.233
Talk to you never.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.435
(Mumbling)

08:24.436 --> 08:26.164
Sir...

08:26.165 --> 08:31.508
To set up this call, I sent Mr.
Hashimoto gifts for 12 straight days.

08:31.509 --> 08:35.645
Do you know how much it costs to
ship a partridge in a pear tree?

08:35.647 --> 08:38.249
We need to call him now.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.383
Okay.

08:39.384 --> 08:42.510
Are you nuts? You can't
call him again so soon.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.053
You'll look totes desperate.

08:45.054 --> 08:46.974
What?

08:47.559 --> 08:49.995
Just wait like three
days before you call him.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.395
Ooh, and change your
relationship status from

08:52.396 --> 08:55.185
"pursuing a deal" to "open to offers".

08:55.186 --> 08:57.753
That actually might work!

08:57.754 --> 09:01.205
I didn't realize that business
negotiations were so much like dating!

09:01.206 --> 09:04.541
Probably because I know
absolutely nothing about dating!

09:04.542 --> 09:08.322
We'll call Hashimoto next week.

09:08.380 --> 09:13.450
Sir, are you going to listen to
some self-obsessed teenage girl?

09:13.451 --> 09:18.227
Or to a self-obsessed
Harvard-trained management major?

09:18.228 --> 09:19.878
If you majored in management,

09:19.879 --> 09:24.295
you'd think you could manage
to put a little makeup on.

09:24.296 --> 09:27.416
(Sing song) Microwaved!

09:27.633 --> 09:30.633
That's not a thing.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.342
And... done.

09:38.986 --> 09:40.786
Ah!

09:43.415 --> 09:46.483
Okay, so lunch is in five minutes,

09:46.484 --> 09:49.420
but to show Olive we don't
need her stupid rules...

09:49.421 --> 09:54.521
I brought us a big snack
to spoil our appetites.

10:02.301 --> 10:05.436
No, thanks. I brought my own snack.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.537
Carrots?

10:08.606 --> 10:10.894
Do you know what these will do to you?

10:10.895 --> 10:14.278
They'll improve your vision
and flush out harmful toxins!

10:14.279 --> 10:18.059
Your good behavior is appalling.

10:21.353 --> 10:24.455
What do you think you're doing?
Do you know what time it is?

10:24.456 --> 10:26.856
Hammer time?

10:34.566 --> 10:38.369
No, fifteen minutes till lights out.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.970
Hammer time was at 4:00, you missed it.

10:41.971 --> 10:43.457
- Did you finish your homework?
- Yes.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.863
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yes.

10:44.864 --> 10:46.187
- Did you floss?
- Yes.

10:46.188 --> 10:50.508
- Are you lying about all this?
- Yes.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.450
Okay, here is the plan.

10:53.451 --> 10:56.992
We take a picture of you
drinking a competitor's soda.

10:56.993 --> 11:01.392
And then "accidentally"
text it to Hashimoto.

11:01.393 --> 11:05.473
Okay, look like you really love it.

11:11.445 --> 11:15.765
Lexi, may I talk to you for a minute?

11:16.574 --> 11:18.675
I have a favor to ask.

11:18.676 --> 11:22.546
Sorry, there's nothing
I can do with your hair.

11:22.547 --> 11:26.583
I'll have you know this
hair went to Harvard.

11:26.584 --> 11:32.323
All of me did. Uh, except my
nose. That was a graduation gift.

11:32.324 --> 11:36.527
Anyway, I need you to stop
distracting Mr. Grundy.

11:36.528 --> 11:38.296
I understand.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.199
What you're saying
is, you're totes jelly.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.120
What?

11:44.170 --> 11:47.671
Sorry, I forgot you
only speak "old people".

11:47.672 --> 11:52.243
You're totally jealous that
Zoltan listens to me and not you.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.579
Ha! I am not "totes jelly!"

11:55.580 --> 11:59.020
And I am not old! I have the
complexion of a one-year-old.

11:59.021 --> 12:04.921
Notice I didn't say newborn, because
let's be honest, newborns are disgusting.

12:05.457 --> 12:08.840
Winter is totes jelly and bitter.

12:08.841 --> 12:12.529
We should make her a peanut
bitter and jelly sandwich.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.499
And add a side order of "hater" tots.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.317
Both: Ooh!

12:17.318 --> 12:18.231
(Gasps)

12:18.232 --> 12:20.032
Oh!

12:23.342 --> 12:26.444
Wow. Your room's pretty messy.

12:26.445 --> 12:31.425
You're right. I have to
do something about it.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.485
Because it has to be super messy.

12:34.486 --> 12:37.521
Olive has to think we love
living without her rules,

12:37.522 --> 12:40.224
even though, and this
might surprise you...

12:40.225 --> 12:45.329
Pepperoni and ice cream is a
little tough on the tum tum.

12:45.330 --> 12:51.230
Anyway, I appreciate you not showering
for three days and smelling terrible.

12:51.503 --> 12:53.863
Yes, that's why I smell.

12:53.864 --> 12:58.342
To help contribute to
whatever it is we're doing.

12:58.343 --> 13:01.412
If Olive thinks she's right,
she'll boss us around forever.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.514
We have to stand up to her tyranny.

13:03.515 --> 13:05.346
Right!

13:05.347 --> 13:08.407
What's tyranny again?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.556
What are you looking for?

13:12.557 --> 13:17.182
My flash drive. It has all
this music I wrote on it!

13:17.183 --> 13:20.603
I can't find it anywhere!

13:21.930 --> 13:24.210
Hey, guys.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.439
Looking for something?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.421
Uh, no.

13:30.422 --> 13:32.209
I have a system.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.678
I know exactly where everything is.

13:34.679 --> 13:38.549
For instance, here is my half-eaten
burrito from three days ago.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.419
Exactly where I meant to put it...

13:41.420 --> 13:44.522
On my favorite dry-clean
only silk blouse.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.280
(Chuckles)

13:46.281 --> 13:49.493
That wouldn't have happened
if you'd cleaned up the room.

13:49.494 --> 13:53.531
Are you kidding? I did it on
purpose! It looks so much better now.

13:53.532 --> 13:57.468
In fact, I'll make matching pants.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.289
There! Super cute!

14:01.206 --> 14:03.066
Ugh.

14:05.577 --> 14:09.380
We have to find that flash drive! Quick,
help me clean up so I can look for it!

14:09.381 --> 14:14.541
I'll put things away, you
just fold... everything!

14:16.354 --> 14:17.830
What are you doing?

14:17.831 --> 14:21.971
Folding. I only had a pair of twos.

14:29.091 --> 14:30.870
I can't live like this anymore.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.813
Olive's right. I like
having a clean room.

14:33.814 --> 14:35.698
I like going to sleep
at a reasonable hour.

14:35.699 --> 14:37.635
- And I like carrots.
- I like carrots too!

14:37.636 --> 14:41.050
I am a weak, weak person.

14:41.051 --> 14:43.202
So I guess we tell Olive she wins?

14:43.203 --> 14:44.603
(Sighs) No way!

14:44.604 --> 14:47.173
If we admit to Olive that we were wrong.

14:47.174 --> 14:50.176
Her most common phrase won't
be "interesting factoid"...

14:50.177 --> 14:53.546
It'll be "I told you so".

14:53.547 --> 14:56.427
Wow. What happened?

14:56.483 --> 14:59.318
Have you seen the error of your ways?

14:59.319 --> 15:03.339
Interesting factoid; I told you so.

15:03.672 --> 15:08.160
No, I didn't clean up
because you thought I should.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.496
I cleaned because...

15:10.497 --> 15:13.029
The new dorm supervisor made me.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.342
There is a new dorm
supervisor? Who is it?

15:15.343 --> 15:17.236
Yeah, who is it?

15:17.237 --> 15:19.880
Uh, his name is...

15:19.881 --> 15:22.308
Dorian Bannister.

15:22.309 --> 15:23.898
Dorian Bannister?

15:23.899 --> 15:27.793
Yeah. Mr. Grundy put him in
charge of supervising us...

15:27.794 --> 15:31.042
Because apparently not
everyone is as able to

15:31.043 --> 15:34.520
handle their independence
as responsibly as I am.

15:34.521 --> 15:40.421
Oh, yeah and the new rule is
only 11 stuffed animals per bed.

15:41.328 --> 15:43.541
(Shrieks) No!

15:43.542 --> 15:46.542
Not the Dolly Llama!

15:47.601 --> 15:49.876
I want to talk to this Bannister guy.

15:49.877 --> 15:51.046
What?

15:51.047 --> 15:53.472
Well, there's no way his
rules are better than mine.

15:53.473 --> 15:57.376
Wait! You can't talk
to Bannister, because...

15:57.377 --> 16:00.346
Bannister's first rule is no
complaining about his rules.

16:00.347 --> 16:02.114
Rats!

16:02.115 --> 16:05.235
Well played, Bannister.

16:07.086 --> 16:08.287
(Talking indistinctly)

16:08.288 --> 16:12.770
Mr. Grundy, I have been trying
to get you to focus all week.

16:12.771 --> 16:18.397
And now, thanks to her, the
Hashimoto deal is probably dead.

16:18.398 --> 16:20.432
(Gasps)

16:20.433 --> 16:24.136
Mr. Hashimoto? What a pleasant surprise!

16:24.137 --> 16:26.138
What is going on between us?

16:26.139 --> 16:29.800
You don't call me for three days,
and you probably do not know this,

16:29.801 --> 16:34.619
but you accidentally sent me a text
of you drinking a competitor's soda.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.080
Did I? Oops.

16:39.252 --> 16:41.253
I just have one question.

16:41.254 --> 16:45.034
Oh, Harvard. I went to Harvard.

16:45.325 --> 16:48.273
My question is, would
you reconsider the deal

16:48.274 --> 16:52.531
if I knock a billion
dollars off the price?

16:52.532 --> 16:56.602
Is it me, or is it desperate in here?

16:56.603 --> 17:00.105
Yes! Yes, absolutely. It's a deal!

17:00.106 --> 17:03.444
Excellent! Let us celebrate
our corporate matrimony

17:03.445 --> 17:06.211
by toasting with some refreshing.

17:06.212 --> 17:08.791
Hashimoto Soda.

17:09.415 --> 17:11.576
(Fizzing)

17:13.520 --> 17:15.570
Zoltan: Oh.

17:15.571 --> 17:16.967
What is this?

17:16.968 --> 17:19.942
It tastes like squid mucous.

17:19.943 --> 17:22.895
How dare you insult
our most popular flavor!

17:22.896 --> 17:25.196
Octopus mucous!

17:25.198 --> 17:27.667
You have dishonored Hashimoto Soda!

17:27.669 --> 17:29.234
The deal is off!

17:29.235 --> 17:32.475
Ah! Godzilla! Not again!

17:32.606 --> 17:35.470
Mr. Grundy, do something!

17:35.471 --> 17:38.143
Lexi! What do you do when a
boy is breaking up with you?

17:38.144 --> 17:43.244
I don't know. It's never
happened to me before.

17:45.284 --> 17:47.921
This Bannister idea was genius!

17:47.922 --> 17:49.887
We can make up any rules we want,

17:49.888 --> 17:52.938
blame them on "Bannister,"
and Olive has to follow them.

17:52.939 --> 17:57.363
I know. By the way, I told Olive that
Bannister outlawed "interesting factoids"

17:57.364 --> 17:59.197
and pants with flowers on them.

17:59.198 --> 18:01.418
(Laughing)

18:03.403 --> 18:06.104
I can't believe Bannister and his rules.

18:06.105 --> 18:11.142
I had to borrow these stupid
flowerless pants from Angus!

18:11.143 --> 18:13.838
And Bannister said we
had to stay up until 9:00!

18:13.839 --> 18:17.349
Like rock and roll musicians!

18:17.350 --> 18:22.150
I barely slept ten
hours. I am slowly dying.

18:22.154 --> 18:25.032
Technically, we're all slowly
dying. I believe it's called aging.

18:25.033 --> 18:27.793
Zip it, Fletcher!

18:29.462 --> 18:32.364
I got to talk to Bannister. Where is he?

18:32.365 --> 18:36.468
Um... I think it's his day off,
so I guess you're out of luck.

18:36.469 --> 18:38.336
(Elevator dings)

18:38.337 --> 18:39.633
Never mind. There's Mr. Grundy.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.313
- I'll talk to him instead.
- Wait...

18:41.314 --> 18:45.277
Mr. Grundy, how could you put
someone in charge of us instead of me?

18:45.278 --> 18:46.845
You have crossed the line.

18:46.846 --> 18:51.946
Rule 27 be darned! I'm
throwing down a gauntlet!

18:53.386 --> 18:57.322
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

18:57.323 --> 19:00.125
But thank you for finding my gauntlet.

19:00.126 --> 19:03.295
I've been looking all over for it.

19:03.296 --> 19:05.911
So what you're saying is...

19:05.912 --> 19:10.268
Somebody at your company is
making up their own rules?

19:10.269 --> 19:12.170
Without your permission?

19:12.171 --> 19:15.206
This is an outrage! An outrage, I say!

19:15.207 --> 19:18.657
I don't know who's responsible
for this, but I intend to find out.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.080
And when I do, I would
not want to be that person.

19:22.081 --> 19:26.351
Mostly because I like being who
I am, because I'm a billionaire.

19:26.352 --> 19:29.321
It's Bannister! He's
run amok with power!

19:29.322 --> 19:31.389
That's my job!

19:31.390 --> 19:33.610
Bannister?

19:33.633 --> 19:35.417
You have a big company.

19:35.418 --> 19:39.130
You can't be expected to know
all the employees by name.

19:39.131 --> 19:42.367
I know exactly who he is.

19:42.368 --> 19:45.370
You do? (Elevator dinging)

19:45.371 --> 19:47.461
Zoltan: Bannister!

19:47.462 --> 19:50.102
A word, please?

19:51.243 --> 19:52.677
Yes, Sir?

19:52.678 --> 19:55.514
There's a real Bannister?

19:55.515 --> 19:59.785
Who do you think you are, Bannister?
Supervising these kids without my approval?

19:59.786 --> 20:03.254
Yeah! What's wrong with you?
Outlawing interesting factoids?

20:03.255 --> 20:06.257
I have had to use
uninteresting factoids all day!

20:06.258 --> 20:07.630
Mr. Grundy, Sir, I...

20:07.631 --> 20:10.161
I don't want to hear it! Pack
up your office, Bannister.

20:10.162 --> 20:12.271
- You're fired!
- What?

20:12.272 --> 20:18.172
But Sir! I have a wife, and
five children, all named Zoltan!

20:19.405 --> 20:22.541
No excuses, Bannister! Hit the bricks!

20:22.542 --> 20:24.462
Wait!

20:24.544 --> 20:26.378
Bannister didn't do anything.

20:26.379 --> 20:32.279
Well, now he can not do anything at home,
because he ain't working here anymore!

20:32.563 --> 20:36.403
Look, Mr. Grundy, I can explain.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.885
I didn't want Olive bossing us around,

20:38.886 --> 20:42.394
so I just told her we were following
rules made up by some guy named Bannister.

20:42.395 --> 20:44.625
I didn't know there was
actually a real Bannister!

20:44.626 --> 20:48.299
Dorian Bannister is just the fake name
I use whenever I need to invent someone!

20:48.300 --> 20:49.994
It's a condition I have.

20:49.995 --> 20:54.603
You should ask my pediatrician,
Dr. Dorian Bannister.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.913
In that case, Bannister, you can stay.

20:56.914 --> 20:59.833
But for goodness sake,
rename your children.

20:59.834 --> 21:03.794
Five Zoltans? That's totes creepy.

21:04.383 --> 21:07.252
Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.

21:07.253 --> 21:12.233
Stop groveling, Bannister,
and get back to work!

21:12.851 --> 21:14.560
(Elevator dings)

21:14.561 --> 21:16.194
So you lied to me?

21:16.195 --> 21:18.847
(Sighs) Look, Olive, I'm sorry.

21:18.848 --> 21:21.332
I didn't want to admit it,
but we do need some rules.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.012
You were right. Again.

21:24.013 --> 21:26.771
I'm sorry too. I kind of overdid it.

21:26.772 --> 21:29.599
Hey, what about me? This
hasn't been easy on me either.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.780
Both: Zip it, Fletcher!

21:39.385 --> 21:42.745
Students! Attention please!

21:43.289 --> 21:46.867
It seems I've made a dreadful mistake.

21:46.868 --> 21:49.088
(Clapping)

21:50.789 --> 21:54.332
Maybe you should get an applause sign.

21:54.333 --> 21:58.236
Turns out that children do
in fact need supervision.

21:58.237 --> 22:01.163
So I've created a new
position at the school,

22:01.164 --> 22:06.816
the sole responsibility of which will
be to look after and nurture you Ants.

22:06.817 --> 22:12.157
I wish I could do it
myself, but I don't want to.

22:14.153 --> 22:17.822
So say hello to your new
den mother, Winter Maddox.

22:17.823 --> 22:19.743
What?

22:19.811 --> 22:21.621
But...

22:21.622 --> 22:25.642
Mr. Grundy, I don't like children.

22:26.834 --> 22:29.707
I didn't even like myself
until I got into Harvard.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.899
Did I mention, I went to Harvard.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.089
I've made up my mind.

22:35.090 --> 22:38.137
- Mr. Grundy, please...
- Sorry, I've got to run.

22:38.138 --> 22:44.038
I'm late for a meeting with City Councilman
Dorian Bannister. (Elevator dinging)

22:47.850 --> 22:49.650
Oh.

22:51.493 --> 22:55.247
Okay, I don't really know the first
thing about being a den mother,

22:55.248 --> 22:58.748
so I did some research by
reading this child rearing book.

22:58.749 --> 23:03.609
Granted, I only got
through the first chapter.

23:04.123 --> 23:08.427
Could you maybe jump ahead
to the chapter on teenagers?

23:08.428 --> 23:12.231
Um, how long do we have to stay in here?

23:12.232 --> 23:17.332
And can we please get
some more challenging toys?

23:20.206 --> 23:22.140
Stop complaining.

23:22.141 --> 23:24.109
This thing is awesome!

23:24.110 --> 23:25.960
Wee!

23:25.961 --> 23:31.861
