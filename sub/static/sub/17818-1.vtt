02:12.729 --> 02:14.606
We'll make camp here for the night.

02:14.689 --> 02:17.044
They'd go a couple more miles
before sundown.

02:17.449 --> 02:19.519
- We'll camp here.
- You're the boss.

04:08.929 --> 04:11.489
Come on, Mr. Lockhart, grub-time.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.367
All right, I'll be along.

04:14.409 --> 04:16.969
Standing here thinking about it
won't bring him back.

04:18.168 --> 04:21.002
No, but it reminds me
of what I came here to do.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.398
Hate's unbecoming in a man like you.

04:24.249 --> 04:26.001
On some men it shows.

04:26.489 --> 04:30.243
- Come on, let's have some coffee.
- All right, I'll be along.

05:55.609 --> 05:56.962
Here we are.

06:16.969 --> 06:18.402
You want something?

06:19.449 --> 06:22.168
I got three wagonloads of supplies outside,
from Laramie.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.240
From Laramie? How did you get through?

06:24.329 --> 06:27.799
- We were lucky. Where do we unload?
- I don't know.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.839
Who does? Where's the boss?

06:31.409 --> 06:32.637
Upstairs.

06:52.249 --> 06:53.841
Anybody home?

06:55.209 --> 06:56.801
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:56.929 --> 06:59.489
I'm looking for the owner of the mercantile.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.363
I'm the owner.

07:03.809 --> 07:04.798
I see.

07:04.929 --> 07:07.489
I have three wagonloads of supplies
for you outside.

07:07.569 --> 07:10.083
I was hoping those supplies
would never arrive.

07:10.169 --> 07:12.285
I thought you'd be anxious
to get these goods.

07:12.369 --> 07:14.121
They're paid for, you seem to need 'em.

07:14.209 --> 07:17.406
I was all sold-out and was hoping
I could stop being a storekeeper.

07:17.489 --> 07:19.241
I'm sorry to disappoint you, ma'am.

07:19.329 --> 07:22.002
Where do you want the supplies unloaded?

07:23.569 --> 07:25.400
Would you like a cup of tea?

07:25.569 --> 07:26.558
What?

07:28.849 --> 07:32.125
It's a long time
since I've had tea with a lady.

07:32.649 --> 07:34.367
That'd be kind of nice.

07:34.849 --> 07:36.760
- Pull up a chair.
- Thank you.

07:42.169 --> 07:44.399
- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart, ma'am.

07:44.489 --> 07:46.207
Mine's Barbara Waggoman.

07:46.329 --> 07:49.127
- Do you take sugar?
- Yes, when I can get it.

07:50.689 --> 07:54.364
I've been in rooms like this before,
but not in this part of the country.

07:54.449 --> 07:57.566
My father brought these things
from our home in Connecticut.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.526
A man of very fine taste, I'd say.

07:59.609 --> 08:03.841
Father had an appreciation for fine living,
but he wasted it in this store...

08:03.969 --> 08:06.927
...emptying flour barrels
and measuring cotton cloth.

08:07.009 --> 08:07.998
I see.

08:08.249 --> 08:11.082
There must be more to life
than emptying barrels of flour.

08:11.169 --> 08:12.648
Yes, I'd say so.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.481
I've wanted to leave Coronado
ever since my father died.

08:16.569 --> 08:20.323
But the stage for Santa Fe stopped running
because of the Apaches.

08:20.809 --> 08:24.006
- Did you have any trouble getting here?
- No, we came from Laramie.

08:24.089 --> 08:26.000
- Is that your home?
- No, ma'am.

08:27.049 --> 08:31.759
No, I can't rightly say
any place is my home.

08:32.249 --> 08:36.845
But everybody should have someplace
to remember and feel like they belong to.

08:39.328 --> 08:42.082
I always feel I belong where I am.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.998
It must be wonderful to feel like that.

08:52.169 --> 08:55.366
Is there anyplace around town
my men and I can find rooms?

08:55.449 --> 08:57.644
- Right over the cafÃ©.
- Fine.

09:01.129 --> 09:03.927
I guess I'd better start unloading
those supplies.

09:06.009 --> 09:09.046
We'll unpack them all
and get them into the shelves for you.

09:09.129 --> 09:12.485
- Thanks for the tea, Miss Waggoman.
- You're welcome, Mr. Lockhart.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.560
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

09:34.609 --> 09:38.124
- Do you sell many of these repeating rifles?
- No, too much money.

09:38.329 --> 09:41.560
- Where'd you get this one?
- Indian traded it for supplies.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.768
I wonder where an Indian
would get a rifle like this.

09:45.849 --> 09:47.840
He don't say. I don't ask.

09:49.049 --> 09:52.405
Suppose you come out
and help the fellas unload this stuff?

10:07.009 --> 10:09.728
- They tell me you're from Snake River.
- Yeah.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.369
We expect an honest deal here.

10:13.809 --> 10:16.164
We've just had one, I hope we get another.

10:16.769 --> 10:19.078
I do, too. We can work the drive.

10:19.969 --> 10:20.958
Pass.

10:21.729 --> 10:22.764
I can't open.

10:29.209 --> 10:30.801
See you in a minute.

10:44.289 --> 10:45.961
'Evening, Miss Waggoman.

10:46.089 --> 10:48.557
- Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.
- Nice evening.

10:51.489 --> 10:55.084
You're the only one in town I know
to talk to. Maybe you can help me.

10:55.169 --> 10:56.727
How can I help you?

10:56.809 --> 10:59.721
I just hate to make that trip back
with three empty wagons.

10:59.809 --> 11:03.563
I thought maybe you could tell me
where to pick up a load of freight.

11:04.129 --> 11:06.768
- There's some salt lagoons nearby.
- That's all?

11:07.089 --> 11:11.958
- They're awful close to Apache land.
- Is this salt free for the taking?

11:12.729 --> 11:14.048
It always has been.

11:14.129 --> 11:17.041
We could harvest it ourselves then,
couldn't we?

11:18.009 --> 11:21.365
You were lucky to get this far
without Indian trouble.

11:22.329 --> 11:26.117
If I were you, I'd head back to Laramie
while the trail's still clear.

11:26.929 --> 11:28.920
I guess you're right about that.

11:30.769 --> 11:33.806
- Good night, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good night, Miss Waggoman.

11:35.649 --> 11:37.002
Miss Waggoman...

11:37.609 --> 11:38.439
Yes?

11:39.689 --> 11:42.999
That shipment I delivered to you:
is everything all right?

11:43.529 --> 11:45.247
Yes, everything was there.

11:47.009 --> 11:49.045
I just wanted to make sure.

11:50.969 --> 11:53.164
- Good night, again.
- 'Night.

12:19.889 --> 12:21.322
Visitors!

12:34.529 --> 12:36.326
Do we fort up or run?

12:36.889 --> 12:38.720
Just keep digging salt.

12:41.049 --> 12:43.483
They're from town, they're not Apaches.

13:20.209 --> 13:23.565
- Who's running this bunch of thieves?
- These men work for me.

13:23.689 --> 13:26.328
- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart. What's your name?

13:26.409 --> 13:29.924
- That's the only introduction you need.
- That's fancy, what's it mean?

13:30.009 --> 13:32.967
We're Barb riders
and that's Barb salt you're stealing.

13:33.049 --> 13:36.883
- I was told this salt's free for the taking.
- It ain't. Not to strangers.

13:36.969 --> 13:39.722
I was told wrong.
If there's any charge, I'll pay for it.

13:39.809 --> 13:41.481
You can't buy your way out of this.

13:41.569 --> 13:44.686
It's only salt they're taking.
It'd be different if it was cattle.

13:44.769 --> 13:47.966
If we don't teach him a lesson,
how do we know what he'd steal next?

13:48.049 --> 13:50.517
Any man says I'd rustle cattle is a liar.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.048
No need for that, Charlie.

13:53.129 --> 13:55.518
And no need for your gun either, mister.

13:55.929 --> 13:59.080
Spud, let's see
how good you can use that rope.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.922
Go ahead, Spud.

14:21.809 --> 14:23.925
Jerk him down again if he needs it.

14:27.529 --> 14:28.962
Burn his wagons!

14:50.649 --> 14:54.927
I'll try your new model gun on your mules.
A man without wagons don't need mules.

14:55.009 --> 14:58.888
- You want me to shoot those mules?
- Anybody invite them on Barb land?

15:30.569 --> 15:31.718
Hold it, Dave!

15:34.049 --> 15:36.643
- Come on, boys, let's finish the mules.
- Hold it, Dave.

15:36.729 --> 15:38.560
I don't need any help to finish this.

15:38.649 --> 15:41.721
- You were told to stay out of trouble.
- I'm in no trouble, he is.

15:41.809 --> 15:43.845
Trespassing and stealing salt.

15:43.929 --> 15:46.568
You burned his wagons
and killed his mules over salt?

15:46.649 --> 15:48.765
- Get out of here.
- Give me that gun.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.446
Now get back to the ranch!

15:52.489 --> 15:54.366
You're forgetting your place, Vic.

15:54.449 --> 15:57.282
You work for my father.
That means you work for me, too.

15:57.369 --> 16:00.122
I don't want to cross you.
It's for your own good.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.404
Now take the boys
and get back to the ranch.

16:02.689 --> 16:04.008
Say "please."

16:04.809 --> 16:05.764
Please.

16:06.569 --> 16:10.005
If you turn up around here again,
you won't need mules to carry you away.

16:10.089 --> 16:11.807
All right, let's go.

16:20.809 --> 16:22.162
I want to thank you.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.887
- Is this your gun?
- Yeah.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.361
I'm sorry about this.

16:26.889 --> 16:31.804
I figure you've had a bellyful of these parts
and are anxious to get out of here.

16:32.089 --> 16:35.604
I figure this place owes me something
and I'm going to make it pay.

16:35.769 --> 16:37.725
Let me straighten you out, mister.

16:37.809 --> 16:40.960
We've got enough trouble around here
with the Apaches and Dave.

16:41.049 --> 16:43.244
Don't you go starting any.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.483
That's what I owe you boys, with
a little extra to get you back to Laramie.

17:01.009 --> 17:03.398
- Thanks, Mr. Lockhart. So long.
- So long.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.887
Looks like the end of our freight line,
doesn't it, Charlie?

17:09.969 --> 17:13.279
How about you, Mr. Lockhart?
You heading back to Fort Laramie?

17:13.409 --> 17:15.638
- Fort Laramie?
- Ain't that where you come from?

17:15.729 --> 17:18.367
I come from Laramie.
I didn't say anything about a fort.

17:18.449 --> 17:20.723
I figured you were an army man.

17:21.769 --> 17:23.487
No, I'm heading back to town.

17:23.569 --> 17:27.084
I liked working for you, Mr. Lockhart.
I sort of hate to leave you.

17:27.489 --> 17:29.719
Maybe this won't be
the kind of work you like.

17:29.809 --> 17:33.518
If it's got to do with who's selling
repeating rifles to the Apaches...

17:33.609 --> 17:34.837
...I'd like to help.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.285
I've got a personal stake
in finding this man. What's yours?

17:38.609 --> 17:40.486
I've always been a nosey man.

17:40.649 --> 17:44.528
While you're in town, I'll head up north
and poke my big nose around.

17:44.609 --> 17:46.520
Up north? That's Apache land up there.

17:46.609 --> 17:49.282
In my case, that's not so dangerous.
My mother was one.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.964
I've got a lot of relatives up there.
I might pick up a little information.

17:53.049 --> 17:55.483
What are you sticking
your neck out for, Charlie?

17:55.569 --> 17:58.402
I'm a Ionely man, Mr. Lockhart.
So are you.

17:58.489 --> 18:01.481
I don't suppose we spoke ten words
coming down here...

18:01.929 --> 18:03.726
...but I feel that I know you.

18:03.929 --> 18:05.567
And I like what I know.

18:08.009 --> 18:09.362
All right, Charlie.

18:12.489 --> 18:14.878
Come on. I'll help you up on that mule.

18:16.969 --> 18:18.322
There we go.

18:28.049 --> 18:30.404
- See you.
- Be seeing you.

19:19.729 --> 19:21.401
- Mr. Lockhart.
- 'Evening.

19:21.489 --> 19:23.366
I thought you'd gone back to Laramie.

19:23.449 --> 19:27.522
I had a little mix-up
with some gentlemen from the Barb ranch.

19:27.689 --> 19:30.249
- They accused me of trespassing.
- Trespassing?

19:30.689 --> 19:33.362
Just who does own those salt lagoons,
anyway?

19:33.449 --> 19:38.079
I suppose they are part of the Barb,
but nobody's made a point of it before.

19:38.169 --> 19:40.478
They sure made a point of it this afternoon.

19:40.569 --> 19:43.208
They burned my wagons
and shot my mules.

19:43.689 --> 19:46.249
They seemed to know
exactly where to find me, too.

19:46.329 --> 19:49.924
Don't blame me for what happened.
I warned you about the lagoons.

19:50.009 --> 19:53.319
You warned me about the Apache.
You didn't mention the Barb.

19:55.209 --> 19:59.043
The fellow that caused the trouble
was named Dave. Do you know him?

19:59.169 --> 20:00.443
He's my cousin.

20:01.129 --> 20:02.482
Your cousin?

20:04.649 --> 20:05.798
Some cousin.

20:05.929 --> 20:07.647
You don't choose your relatives.

20:07.729 --> 20:10.243
This is the most unfriendly country
I've ever been in.

20:10.329 --> 20:11.523
Why's everyone so touchy?

20:11.609 --> 20:14.806
It's a one-man country
and Alec Waggoman's the man.

20:15.129 --> 20:17.199
I think I've got to meet that man.

20:18.089 --> 20:20.159
If you stay, you will.

20:20.249 --> 20:22.717
I'm figuring on staying around for a while.

20:29.209 --> 20:32.042
- Is something bothering you?
- Yes, a lot of things.

20:32.489 --> 20:33.842
Can I help you?

20:35.809 --> 20:36.844
You have.

20:41.209 --> 20:44.406
Just standing here looking at you
makes me feel easier.

20:46.929 --> 20:49.443
You're a bachelor, aren't you?

20:50.409 --> 20:51.888
How'd you know that?

20:52.049 --> 20:56.327
Only a Ionely man could find pleasure
watching a woman unpack bolts of cotton.

20:56.529 --> 21:00.681
It's not so much what you're doing,
it's just you're mighty nice to look at.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.647
I'm not even pretty.

21:04.249 --> 21:08.288
I suppose I've seen
prettier girls in dancehalls...

21:09.769 --> 21:11.646
...but you're sort of...

21:12.329 --> 21:13.887
...beautiful, I'd say.

21:16.849 --> 21:19.647
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

21:20.009 --> 21:23.399
And a stranger had to come
all the way from Laramie to say it.

21:25.009 --> 21:27.967
I wish that was my only reason
for being in Coronado.

21:32.489 --> 21:35.242
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:47.929 --> 22:48.964
Dave!

23:16.009 --> 23:18.125
I told you not to start anything.

23:34.049 --> 23:37.041
Let it alone, Davey boy,
or I'll clip off a thumb.

24:30.849 --> 24:31.998
Hold it, Vic.

24:37.129 --> 24:39.006
I'm Alec Waggoman of the Barb.

24:39.089 --> 24:41.125
- What's the reason for this?
- Ask your son.

24:41.209 --> 24:42.244
I'm asking you.

24:42.329 --> 24:46.208
Go out to the salt lagoons. You'll find
12 dead mules and three burned wagons.

24:46.289 --> 24:48.757
- They belong to me.
- Nobody asked you to come here.

24:48.849 --> 24:51.158
I'm here, Mr. Waggoman,
and I'm staying here.

24:51.249 --> 24:53.205
This town better get used to the idea.

24:53.289 --> 24:55.484
- Who are you?
- No one you ever heard of.

24:55.569 --> 24:57.127
What do you want in this town?

24:57.209 --> 25:00.519
That's the big question, huh?
You don't ask it very friendly.

25:00.609 --> 25:02.565
I don't have to. I own this town.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.881
I own as far as you can ride
in any direction for three days.

25:05.969 --> 25:07.004
So I hear.

25:07.089 --> 25:10.604
Apache land is less than one day's ride
from here. You own that too?

25:10.689 --> 25:12.407
I have no quarrel with the Apache.

25:12.489 --> 25:14.957
It's dirt farmers and fence-raisers
I'm keeping out.

25:15.049 --> 25:16.926
- Now, which are you?
- Neither.

25:17.009 --> 25:18.522
Then what are you?

25:18.809 --> 25:20.288
I come from Laramie.

25:20.369 --> 25:22.644
You'd better keep travelling, stranger.

25:22.849 --> 25:26.444
Stop in at the Barb in the morning
and I'll pay you for what you lost.

25:26.529 --> 25:28.918
I see you've already collected interest.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.761
Vic, get the boys back to the ranch
without any more trouble.

25:32.849 --> 25:35.409
Any of you who can't go peacefully is fired.

25:35.649 --> 25:39.119
Dave got what you should've given him
a long time ago, Alec.

25:54.289 --> 25:56.325
I'd like to thank you for what you did.

25:56.409 --> 25:59.321
- Why do you think I did it?
- You have a fair sense of justice.

25:59.409 --> 26:02.719
This is the only sense of justice
folks respect around here.

26:03.209 --> 26:05.518
Hop in and ride out to my ranch with me.

26:05.609 --> 26:08.646
I appreciate the hospitality, ma'am.
I have rooms in the hotel.

26:08.729 --> 26:11.118
Don't argue. I want to talk to you. Get in.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.041
We'll pick up your horse.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.803
This isn't exactly a horse I've got here.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.768
I don't think you ought to go
with that Canaday woman.

26:34.849 --> 26:36.965
The Waggomans won't like it.

26:37.049 --> 26:38.926
I kinda figured they wouldn't.

26:44.969 --> 26:45.958
Come on.

27:05.169 --> 27:07.842
Why did you fight Lockhart?
It wasn't your quarrel, Vic.

27:07.929 --> 27:10.204
Alec was watching.
I had to stand up for Dave.

27:10.289 --> 27:13.361
You act like Alec was your own father,
instead of your boss.

27:13.449 --> 27:15.679
He's using you just like he used my father.

27:15.769 --> 27:19.284
When he no longer needs you,
he'll drop you like an ordinary cowhand.

27:19.369 --> 27:21.166
Alec wouldn't do that to me.

27:21.249 --> 27:24.127
He knows if Dave were on his own,
the Barb would fall apart.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.688
Does Dave know that?

27:26.129 --> 27:28.040
Alec won't be around forever.

27:28.209 --> 27:29.688
Then where would you be?

27:29.769 --> 27:31.407
Alec and me talked that over.

27:31.489 --> 27:34.287
When his time comes,
he's leaving the Barb to Dave and me.

27:34.369 --> 27:36.724
That's the same promise
he made my father.

27:36.809 --> 27:40.404
If he broke his word with his own brother,
what can you, a stranger, expect?

27:40.489 --> 27:42.957
Your father was an easy man. I'm not.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.165
No one's breaking his word with me.

27:45.729 --> 27:49.244
This is no place for us. I want to leave
and I want you to leave with me.

27:49.329 --> 27:50.603
- Where can we go?
- Anywhere.

27:50.689 --> 27:52.202
That's the same as nowhere.

27:52.289 --> 27:54.439
We've been over this before.

27:54.689 --> 27:56.725
Here in Coronado, we've got something.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.277
Anywhere else we go,
we're a couple of nobodies.

27:59.369 --> 28:01.599
You keep saying we've got nothing
if we leave.

28:01.689 --> 28:04.249
If we have each other,
doesn't that mean anything?

28:04.329 --> 28:06.479
I love you, Barbara, you know that.

28:07.689 --> 28:09.645
But I've worked my whole life for the Barb.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.640
I've got sweat and blood in that ground.

28:11.729 --> 28:13.720
I'm not giving up what's rightfully mine.

28:13.809 --> 28:15.322
I know my uncle and my cousin.

28:15.409 --> 28:18.321
Neither one will give up a foot of ground
without a fight.

28:18.409 --> 28:20.161
I don't want to see you hurt, Vic.

28:20.249 --> 28:21.887
Only you can hurt me.

28:21.969 --> 28:23.641
I want to be your wife...

28:23.809 --> 28:28.246
...but if I can't get you to leave with me,
I won't stay here to become your widow.

28:28.729 --> 28:30.242
I don't die so quick.

28:34.369 --> 28:37.600
- What do you think of the Half Moon?
- What am I supposed to think?

28:37.689 --> 28:40.123
It'll go a lot smoother when you take over.

28:40.409 --> 28:42.639
I'm hiring you to be the new foreman.

28:42.769 --> 28:44.964
Sounds fine, but I'm not looking for a job.

28:45.049 --> 28:46.846
Now you've made enemies of the Barb...

28:46.929 --> 28:49.682
...you can't stay here
and stand up to them on your own.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.680
The Barb's been giving you trouble, too?

28:51.769 --> 28:52.724
Trouble?

28:52.889 --> 28:55.449
Twenty-eight years
I've been battling Alec Waggoman.

28:55.529 --> 28:57.724
Keeping him from swallowing up
the Half Moon...

28:57.809 --> 29:00.687
...the way he swallowed up
every other piece of grazing land.

29:00.769 --> 29:02.725
I'm at the point where I need help.

29:02.849 --> 29:06.125
I'm sorry, Miss Canaday.
I'm not the man for you.

29:06.209 --> 29:08.564
You ain't afraid of the Barb.
You proved that.

29:08.649 --> 29:10.719
I've got no quarrel
with the Waggomans now.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.079
They agreed to pay me for my mules,
my wagons...

29:13.169 --> 29:15.285
You'll take the money
and let them run you out?

29:15.369 --> 29:18.805
No, but I wouldn't be any good for you.
I'm no cowhand.

29:18.929 --> 29:20.885
You're no muleskinner, either.

29:21.449 --> 29:23.883
I can tell that from the look of your hands.

29:23.969 --> 29:26.437
Just what are you doing here, Lockhart?

29:26.729 --> 29:31.359
You might say on account of some
good wagons of mine that got burnt.

29:31.609 --> 29:35.045
Or you might blame it on a rope
that dragged me through a fire.

29:35.649 --> 29:39.244
But you'd be closer if you asked me
about my brother, just a kid.

29:44.209 --> 29:45.927
I can't realise yet he's dead.

29:46.009 --> 29:48.000
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

29:49.049 --> 29:52.644
I've thought about it too much to talk.
I'm going to do something about it.

29:52.729 --> 29:55.038
So, you're here to hunt a man and kill him.

29:57.289 --> 29:58.847
I was wondering if...

29:59.089 --> 30:01.284
Can I have one of your saddle ponies?

30:01.369 --> 30:04.600
I'll pay you for it
as soon as I settle with the Waggomans.

30:05.689 --> 30:06.963
I guess I can fix you up.

30:07.049 --> 30:11.440
We'll go down to the corral after supper.
Maybe you'll reconsider.

30:11.529 --> 30:12.848
The supper sounds fine.

31:04.009 --> 31:05.761
Do we fight or talk?

31:05.849 --> 31:09.842
We gotta finish that fight someday.
I don't know whether I won or lost.

31:10.009 --> 31:11.647
Will we call it a draw?

31:12.049 --> 31:13.562
I'll settle for that.

31:13.729 --> 31:16.118
Come on in, the old man's expecting you.

31:27.249 --> 31:28.887
- 'Morning, sir.
- 'Morning.

31:29.649 --> 31:32.322
Wagons like yours cost about $75 apiece.

31:32.409 --> 31:33.842
A good mule costs $20.

31:33.929 --> 31:37.126
That means the Barb owes you
around $600. I'll make it $600.

31:37.209 --> 31:40.281
- That's a little more than I paid.
- I'm satisfied if you are.

31:40.369 --> 31:42.325
- I'm satisfied.
- Sit down.

31:43.329 --> 31:46.127
You worry me, Lockhart,
and I'm not easily worried.

31:46.209 --> 31:47.483
What do you want from me?

31:47.569 --> 31:49.844
Nothing to hide, nothing to worry about.

31:49.929 --> 31:51.521
This is a new and hard country.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.965
I've made hard decisions,
but never done anything I was ashamed of.

31:55.049 --> 31:58.086
You don't seem to have much trouble
with the Apache, do you?

31:58.369 --> 32:00.678
I respect them. They were here first.

32:01.209 --> 32:04.246
Whatever I got from them, I bought.
I didn't just take it.

32:04.329 --> 32:07.685
About six months ago, they massacred
a cavalry patrol on your land.

32:07.769 --> 32:09.521
What did you do about that?

32:09.769 --> 32:10.758
Nothing.

32:10.849 --> 32:13.886
They have a right to hunt on my land.
That was part of our deal.

32:13.969 --> 32:16.358
They shot down 12 men
on a routine patrol.

32:16.449 --> 32:18.405
Was that part of the deal, too?

32:18.809 --> 32:21.448
I don't know who fired the first shot,
do you?

32:21.569 --> 32:23.639
I know the United States Cavalry.

32:25.049 --> 32:27.324
What's all this got to do
between you and me?

32:27.409 --> 32:28.603
Everything.

32:30.649 --> 32:34.198
I want to be friends with you, Lockhart.
I don't have to be, I want to be.

32:34.289 --> 32:36.644
- Why?
- I'd like you to work for me.

32:39.209 --> 32:41.279
We don't speak the same language.

32:41.609 --> 32:43.679
Maybe we could both bend a little.

32:45.249 --> 32:48.321
I've never owned an acre of land,
never wanted to.

32:48.409 --> 32:51.287
You couldn't live
with an acre less than you've got.

32:51.369 --> 32:52.802
Just where do we bend?

32:52.889 --> 32:54.845
I'm not trying to buy your friendship.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.397
I'm looking for a way to reach it.
How do I do that?

32:57.489 --> 33:00.879
Why am I so important to you?
I don't know you, you don't know me.

33:01.169 --> 33:04.525
I don't know you,
but I knew you were coming.

33:05.169 --> 33:06.204
What?

33:07.129 --> 33:08.642
I was expecting you.

33:11.409 --> 33:13.206
You'll have to explain that.

33:15.249 --> 33:18.082
You wouldn't understand.
I'll get you your money.

33:18.609 --> 33:20.088
Vic, come in here.

33:22.329 --> 33:23.318
Yes.

33:23.449 --> 33:24.882
Get me $600.

33:24.969 --> 33:27.437
The cash is in the safe.
You put it there yourself.

33:27.529 --> 33:29.281
I forgot that. I'll get it.

33:31.209 --> 33:34.281
- It's quite an outfit you've got here.
- Biggest in the territory.

33:34.369 --> 33:36.166
It'll be bigger yet, one of these days.

33:36.249 --> 33:38.638
Doesn't seem like
there's much spreading room left.

33:38.729 --> 33:40.481
There's always room, Lockhart.

33:40.569 --> 33:43.561
A ranch that stops growing
might just as well be dead.

33:43.849 --> 33:46.602
Some places get so big they just bust,
you know.

33:56.609 --> 33:57.803
Here we are.

34:00.569 --> 34:01.888
$50, $100...

34:02.289 --> 34:06.362
You'd better watch what you're doing.
Those aren't $50s, they're $100s.

34:08.649 --> 34:10.799
- Give him $600.
- Yeah, sure.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.601
- There you are.
- Thank you.

34:15.728 --> 34:18.038
- We're all settled up.
- Not quite.

34:18.168 --> 34:21.320
- There's nothing to keep you here now.
- Any reason for me to leave?

34:21.409 --> 34:24.321
My son's never been whipped before.
He's not going to like it.

34:24.409 --> 34:27.242
Nobody likes being whipped.
Most men get over it.

34:27.329 --> 34:31.117
Look, this is a big country.
There are plenty of towns around.

34:31.409 --> 34:35.163
Why don't you be a good fellow
and pick some other place to roost?

34:35.809 --> 34:37.242
I'll think it over.

34:57.249 --> 34:59.479
That $600 comes out of your pay, Vic.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.958
My pay?

35:01.209 --> 35:03.564
What are you saying?
Dave burned the wagons, not me.

35:03.649 --> 35:05.287
You should've stopped him.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.759
I've got thousands of cattle to look over.
I can't be everywhere at once.

35:08.849 --> 35:10.168
You've got it all wrong.

35:10.249 --> 35:12.763
Maybe I've had it all wrong for a long time.

35:12.849 --> 35:16.080
When Dave's ma died,
I figured the boy needed a tight rein.

35:16.329 --> 35:18.559
I thought he'd take it better
from you than me.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.288
He don't need someone
to get him into more scrapes.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.883
I swear I tried to stop him
out at the lagoons.

35:23.969 --> 35:26.642
Next time there's a mix-up,
you'd better stop him...

35:26.729 --> 35:30.039
...or I'll bust you to a cowhand.
Better yet, I'll fire you.

35:31.169 --> 35:32.921
- What's that?
- You heard.

35:33.249 --> 35:34.398
Say it again.

35:34.489 --> 35:37.561
I said, " Next time Dave gets
in a mess like that, you're fired."

35:37.649 --> 35:40.641
No one's firing me off this ranch. No one.

35:40.769 --> 35:43.124
I belong here as much as you
and more than Dave.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.278
You're wrong again.

35:44.369 --> 35:46.166
I like you. I've always liked you...

35:46.249 --> 35:49.878
...but Dave's my blood. Him, I love.
And liking and loving ain't the same.

35:49.969 --> 35:53.245
You made me a promise.
I get a share of this ranch with Dave.

35:53.329 --> 35:54.603
I'm holding you to it.

35:54.689 --> 35:58.477
You've got nothing in your name,
not even the saddle on the horse you ride.

35:58.609 --> 36:01.726
How are you going to hold me to it
if I change my mind?

36:02.689 --> 36:04.964
You want to find out, Alec? Fire me.

36:05.889 --> 36:07.242
Go ahead, fire me.

36:08.449 --> 36:10.883
Looking at you, I see myself 20 years ago.

36:11.449 --> 36:13.758
I don't want to fight you, boy. I need you.

36:13.849 --> 36:16.841
But you need me, too.
Let's both try and remember that.

36:19.049 --> 36:21.085
Alec, you oughtn't to push me.

36:21.289 --> 36:22.961
I don't like to be pushed.

36:23.049 --> 36:26.121
I'd push you right off the earth
if I thought it'd help Dave.

36:26.209 --> 36:29.724
You're right, he is weak.
All the more reason he needs your help.

36:30.329 --> 36:34.288
Keep both eyes on him, for me,
and I'll be beholden to you.

36:36.089 --> 36:39.877
All right, Alec,
but don't ever push me again.

37:23.449 --> 37:24.598
Hi, Charlie.

37:26.769 --> 37:30.000
You didn't spend much time
up in Apache land, did you?

37:31.169 --> 37:34.241
My mother's relatives
wasn't anxious for me to stay on.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.721
When I was a boy...

37:37.289 --> 37:41.487
...my pa told me that I was lucky
to have an Irish pa and an Indian ma.

37:41.889 --> 37:44.642
He said I'd have
two places to come home to.

37:44.769 --> 37:46.600
Don't seem like I have any.

37:48.169 --> 37:51.366
About the only home I remember
is an army barracks.

37:51.809 --> 37:53.879
Give me a little of that, will you?

37:54.529 --> 37:56.281
I guess we're not the homey type.

37:56.369 --> 37:58.803
Why don't you go back to Laramie,
Captain?

38:00.449 --> 38:01.768
What do you mean, "Captain"?

38:01.889 --> 38:05.245
You talk like one.
I used to be a scout in the Cavalry.

38:05.409 --> 38:08.321
It got so I could fix a man's rank
by the tone of his voice.

38:08.409 --> 38:10.206
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

38:10.289 --> 38:13.599
'Cause there's big trouble coming
and you can't handle it by yourself.

38:13.689 --> 38:15.998
Suppose you just tell me
what you found out?

38:16.089 --> 38:17.078
Sure.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.559
If you're looking for the repeating rifles,
you're in the right place.

38:20.649 --> 38:24.244
The young bucks are sporting 'em.
They're expecting a couple hundred more.

38:24.449 --> 38:27.486
- When? Who from?
- I didn't press the point.

38:27.649 --> 38:30.561
If I'd been too nosey,
I wouldn't have been able to ride out.

38:30.649 --> 38:33.243
But they've got a contact.
Somebody's supplying them.

38:33.329 --> 38:35.797
There weren't any guns
in that freight we hauled.

38:35.889 --> 38:39.120
No more wagons in for a month.
Where's the shipment coming from?

38:39.249 --> 38:42.924
All I know is they're excited,
like they're expecting them guns soon.

38:43.049 --> 38:45.688
- In a couple of days, at most.
- Why do you think that?

38:45.809 --> 38:49.563
'Cause they already paid for them,
and nobody takes pay from the Apaches...

38:49.649 --> 38:51.128
...without delivering.

38:51.209 --> 38:53.120
Those guns might be here already.

38:53.209 --> 38:55.598
Sounds more like it, but where?

38:56.049 --> 38:57.926
They'd be pretty hard to hide.

38:59.569 --> 39:02.003
- Are you expecting to meet someone?
- No.

39:03.769 --> 39:06.761
Somebody's following you,
but he's keeping out of sight.

39:07.969 --> 39:12.326
I thought I saw the sun reflecting
against a gun or a pair of spurs.

39:12.409 --> 39:16.004
- Better let me ride with you.
- No, you go back to town. See you later.

39:16.089 --> 39:17.602
Whatever you say, Captain.

39:47.049 --> 39:48.323
Hold it, mister.

39:49.409 --> 39:50.603
Speak your peace.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.522
- I wasn't doing nothing.
- You followed me from the Barb.

39:53.609 --> 39:55.281
I mean no harm. I ain't got a gun.

39:55.369 --> 39:58.486
Come on.
This hot sun makes a fella impatient.

39:58.769 --> 40:01.283
I'll just trying to earn an honest dollar.

40:01.369 --> 40:07.001
Not holding a steady job gives me time
to pick up bits of news here and there.

40:07.969 --> 40:10.927
I guess I know everything private
that goes on in Coronado.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.647
What's that got to do with me?

40:12.729 --> 40:17.598
You're a man that's looking for somethin'
and willin' to pay for it.

40:18.769 --> 40:21.966
That depends on what the information is,
and who's selling it.

40:22.249 --> 40:26.879
I ain't got no references,
but anybody can tell you that Chris Boldt...

40:27.289 --> 40:29.200
...is a man not to be trusted.

40:29.369 --> 40:32.008
That means nobody's secrets
are sacred with me.

40:33.649 --> 40:35.879
Just who are you figuring on selling out?

40:36.449 --> 40:39.441
- You just name him.
- It wouldn't be me, would it?

40:40.209 --> 40:42.165
Who put you on my trail?

40:42.689 --> 40:44.725
- Who are you working for?
- Myself.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.083
You're lying.

40:46.489 --> 40:47.968
Come on, try again.

40:49.649 --> 40:53.039
Well, I can see we ain't going
to do no business, so...

40:53.329 --> 40:55.684
...if you'll lower that gun,
I'll get on my way.

40:55.809 --> 40:57.845
Go on, go ahead.

40:59.849 --> 41:02.602
Don't ever come up riding behind me again.

41:19.529 --> 41:21.360
I'm Sheriff Tom Quigby.

41:21.489 --> 41:23.002
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

41:23.089 --> 41:26.286
I handle the law here in Coronado.
I like things peaceful.

41:26.489 --> 41:27.842
It seems peaceful to me.

41:27.929 --> 41:30.284
It sure ain't, not since you breezed in.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.398
I heard about your fight
with Dave Waggoman.

41:33.489 --> 41:36.003
Dave's the kind of a lad
that'll hold a grudge.

41:36.089 --> 41:39.365
You two meet up again and like as not,
there'll be a killing.

41:39.729 --> 41:41.208
That's up to Dave.

41:41.289 --> 41:43.757
It's up to me to see that it don't happen.

41:43.889 --> 41:45.845
So, I'm suggesting you leave town.

41:45.929 --> 41:49.444
Why don't you take it up with Dave?
It was him that started it.

41:49.529 --> 41:53.647
- Or do you take orders from the Barb?
- I don't take orders from anyone.

41:54.129 --> 41:56.518
Will you excuse me?
I want to bed down my horse.

41:56.609 --> 41:58.008
- Thanks for the knife.
- Anytime.

41:58.089 --> 41:59.158
It's your neck.

41:59.289 --> 42:03.441
If you want a Christian funeral,
leave some money with the undertaker.

43:59.169 --> 44:00.807
'Evening, Miss Waggoman.

44:01.249 --> 44:03.001
Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.

44:03.609 --> 44:05.361
<i>Padre,</i> this is Mr. Lockhart.

44:05.649 --> 44:09.324
<i>Padre.</i> Is this a private celebration?

44:09.569 --> 44:12.288
No, everyone is welcome at a wedding.

44:12.529 --> 44:14.804
He brought the supplies in from Laramie.

44:14.889 --> 44:18.438
It's a good thing you got here.
I was running out of candles.

44:19.849 --> 44:22.602
These Pueblos are a lot different
from the Apache.

44:22.689 --> 44:26.568
The Pueblos were cliff dwellers.
They have lived in peace for centuries.

44:26.689 --> 44:30.602
The Apaches are hunters and warriors.
They have never been anything else.

44:30.689 --> 44:33.442
Speaking of the Apache,
do you know anything about...

44:33.529 --> 44:37.317
...the massacre of a Cavalry patrol
at Dutch Creek, several months ago?

44:37.409 --> 44:41.368
Only what I heard, that it was
an unprovoked and ruthless killing.

44:41.729 --> 44:44.641
Did you know
that the Apache used repeating rifles?

44:44.729 --> 44:46.208
There was talk about that.

44:46.289 --> 44:49.087
Was there any talk about
where the rifles came from?

44:49.169 --> 44:51.842
Some men will sell anything for a profit.

44:53.009 --> 44:55.728
I suppose there's a man like that
in every town.

44:56.529 --> 44:57.598
<i>Padre.</i>

44:57.809 --> 44:58.878
Excuse me.

45:01.569 --> 45:04.242
I heard my uncle paid you
for your mules and wagons.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.518
That he did.

45:06.449 --> 45:08.246
Then, I guess, you'll be leaving soon.

45:08.329 --> 45:10.843
No, I think I'll stick around for a while.

45:11.129 --> 45:13.597
Maybe you could invite me up to tea again.

45:20.729 --> 45:22.367
Still around, Lockhart?

45:22.609 --> 45:25.806
- Getting used to the idea?
- Looks like I'll have to.

45:25.889 --> 45:29.768
- I'm sorry I'm late, the old man kept me.
- Mr. Lockhart was filling in for you.

45:29.849 --> 45:32.807
Never thought you'd find anything
like this in Coronado, right?

45:32.889 --> 45:34.322
Nor anyplace else.

45:34.409 --> 45:37.082
I hope you're not going to be late
for your own wedding.

45:37.169 --> 45:40.206
I'm ready right now, <i>Padre.</i>
Even got my wedding suit on.

45:40.689 --> 45:42.805
Think Alec'll give you a night off?

45:42.929 --> 45:45.966
- I'd better be moving along. Good night.
- Good night.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.644
I'll trouble you for your gun, Lockhart.

46:02.649 --> 46:03.843
Hand it over.

46:04.649 --> 46:05.638
What'd I do now?

46:05.729 --> 46:08.721
You just can't let a day go by
without picking a fight, can you?

46:08.809 --> 46:10.606
Who's complaining now, Sheriff?

46:10.689 --> 46:13.806
- Ever hear of a Chris Boldt?
- Yeah, I've heard of him.

46:13.889 --> 46:15.242
When did you see him last?

46:15.329 --> 46:18.958
About a half hour ago, he came
out of an alley and pulled a knife on me.

46:19.049 --> 46:20.721
He was there. He saw him.

46:21.129 --> 46:22.403
I didn't see.

46:22.929 --> 46:26.205
- What's the charge, Sheriff?
- Supposin' you tell me what happened.

46:26.329 --> 46:29.924
I just told you. He pulled a knife on me,
we wrestled around for a bit...

46:30.009 --> 46:31.840
...and he ran down the alley.

46:31.929 --> 46:34.443
It's not all, Lockhart. Chris Boldt is dead.

46:35.689 --> 46:36.678
What?

46:36.809 --> 46:40.484
I found him at the end of the alley.
He was knifed to death.

46:41.769 --> 46:42.758
Let's go.

47:08.769 --> 47:11.044
I want to see him alone, inside.

47:17.569 --> 47:21.244
- How'd you get in this mess?
- I thought maybe you were behind it.

47:21.329 --> 47:24.480
Should I want to get rid of you,
I won't use any half measures.

47:24.569 --> 47:27.641
You said you owned the whole town.
Does that include the sheriff?

47:27.729 --> 47:30.846
Quigby's an honest man.
I never interfere with him.

47:31.769 --> 47:35.921
You'll need a lawyer and a friendly judge.
I've got them both. I'll try to get you out.

47:36.129 --> 47:39.326
- Why are you doing all this?
- I want you out of Coronado.

47:39.409 --> 47:42.446
Suppose you tell me
the real reason why you're here.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.167
- That's not easy.
- Why?

47:48.449 --> 47:51.566
- Do you dream much, Lockhart?
- No.

47:52.809 --> 47:54.481
You're a lucky man.

47:56.089 --> 48:01.004
Ever since Dave's ma died, I've had
the same dream several nights a week.

48:02.209 --> 48:03.801
It's always the same.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.844
A stranger comes into my home.

48:07.769 --> 48:10.727
He's tall, lean, like yourself.

48:12.129 --> 48:15.565
He has a voice like yours,
even walks like you.

48:17.809 --> 48:20.243
I don't know anything about dreams.

48:23.689 --> 48:25.964
He comes with a gun in his hand.

48:27.329 --> 48:29.684
- He comes to kill my boy.
- What?

48:32.089 --> 48:33.078
My Dave.

48:34.849 --> 48:36.646
I know it's only a dream...

48:38.169 --> 48:41.445
...but I'd rest much easier
if you hadn't had come to Coronado.

48:41.529 --> 48:44.123
I'd rest much easier, too, if I hadn't.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.919
Then take my offer and go away.

48:47.649 --> 48:50.527
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't accept the conditions.

48:50.609 --> 48:51.598
Why not?

48:52.289 --> 48:55.247
You're not going to find the answer
to your dream around here.

48:55.329 --> 48:57.320
You better look someplace else.

49:00.249 --> 49:01.443
Tom.

49:28.809 --> 49:30.527
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Kate.

49:33.889 --> 49:34.924
What is it?

49:35.009 --> 49:39.241
I just thought sometime we'd have more
to say to each other than just "hello."

49:40.049 --> 49:42.085
What else is there to say?

49:43.409 --> 49:44.762
Nothing, I guess.

49:53.889 --> 49:56.801
- Why'd you do it, Lockhart?
- You, too?

49:57.209 --> 50:00.565
You get in a scrap with a man
and five minutes later he's found dead.

50:00.649 --> 50:03.243
- What should I think?
- You should think I killed him.

50:03.329 --> 50:07.208
I came from Laramie to creep up
a dark alley and knife the town drunk.

50:07.369 --> 50:10.520
- Does that make better sense?
- lf it did, I wouldn't be here.

50:10.609 --> 50:12.406
Can you get me out of this place?

50:12.489 --> 50:15.720
That's what I came for.
I got the circuit judge to give me a writ.

50:15.809 --> 50:19.848
- You're released to me until the trial.
- That's the best offer I've had today.

50:19.929 --> 50:22.124
- You're a very fine woman.
- No, I'm not.

50:22.249 --> 50:24.683
The Half Moon needs a foreman
who the Barb respects.

50:24.809 --> 50:27.403
You're the only man around here
who fills that bill.

50:27.489 --> 50:30.640
I don't know anything about cattle.
I wouldn't do you any good.

50:30.729 --> 50:33.197
You've got cause to hate the Barb.
That'll do me.

50:33.329 --> 50:36.082
I've got grief enough of my own
without taking on yours.

50:36.169 --> 50:38.683
I'll give you one minute
to make up your mind.

50:38.769 --> 50:43.160
Either you take my offer or I'll tear up
this writ and you can rot in jail.

50:56.409 --> 50:59.606
- You're just a hard, scheming old woman.
- Ugly, too.

50:59.689 --> 51:02.408
Tom, let this rooster out of here.

51:10.809 --> 51:13.403
These beef tallies
still don't come out right.

51:14.169 --> 51:15.602
You add them up.

51:15.689 --> 51:18.157
I'm not good at paperwork, Pa.
You know that.

51:18.249 --> 51:21.207
No cowman is, but it's gotta be done.

51:24.169 --> 51:28.447
You can't hold onto 100,000 acres
by riding horse in a buckskin jacket.

51:29.129 --> 51:31.563
You've got to develop a head for figures.

51:32.129 --> 51:33.357
Sure, Pa.

51:35.409 --> 51:37.639
You're not even listening to me, son.

51:38.129 --> 51:41.121
Sure, I'm listening to you, Pa.
I always listen to you.

51:41.329 --> 51:43.160
Bring a chair over here.

51:44.249 --> 51:45.728
Come on, right here.

51:46.089 --> 51:47.727
There you are. Sit down.

51:50.329 --> 51:51.444
You know...

51:52.249 --> 51:56.527
...you're just like your mother.
She'd always listen, but never understood.

51:57.689 --> 51:59.168
I'm going to try, Pa.

51:59.529 --> 52:02.441
I'm going to try to be like you want me
from now on.

52:03.409 --> 52:05.365
It hurts me to ride you, son.

52:05.849 --> 52:08.602
And if I do, it's only because I love you.

52:09.289 --> 52:11.803
I want to protect you and be proud of you.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.768
I just want to be able
to stand on my own feet.

52:15.129 --> 52:16.323
Vic won't let me.

52:16.409 --> 52:19.207
Don't blame Vic.
He's only carrying out my orders.

52:19.409 --> 52:22.719
You still need him, boy.
Believe me when I tell you that.

52:22.809 --> 52:26.802
I know you mean well, Pa,
but it don't look good.

52:26.969 --> 52:29.722
Vic giving the orders
when I should be the one.

52:29.969 --> 52:31.721
You will soon, son.

52:31.809 --> 52:34.118
You will soon. Just bide your time.

52:35.089 --> 52:36.204
You see...

52:49.129 --> 52:51.848
- The Half Moon hired Lockhart.
- I thought he was in jail.

52:51.929 --> 52:54.921
- Kate got him out on a writ.
- You might've expected that.

52:55.009 --> 52:58.797
Stranger comes to town, you boys fix it
so he gets a grudge against the Barb.

52:58.889 --> 53:01.005
Kate won't miss an opportunity like that.

53:01.089 --> 53:03.728
- Come on, Vic.
- Where do you think you're going?

53:03.809 --> 53:06.004
Kate hired herself a gun,
that's plain enough.

53:06.089 --> 53:08.478
Let her get away with this,
she'll hire more.

53:08.609 --> 53:09.962
Nobody asked you.

53:10.329 --> 53:12.445
Keep away from the Half Moon,
both of you.

53:12.529 --> 53:15.441
You've never run away from a fight.
What's got into you?

53:15.529 --> 53:18.646
Times have changed.
I used to crack down plenty. I had to.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.128
There wasn't much law then.

53:20.249 --> 53:22.683
It was the only way
to build the Barb and hold it.

53:22.809 --> 53:24.720
And now you've gone soft, huh?

53:24.969 --> 53:27.164
You'll be taking over the ranch soon, Dave.

53:27.249 --> 53:29.080
Maybe sooner than you think.

53:29.209 --> 53:30.961
You'll need peace and friends.

53:31.049 --> 53:33.882
What do you expect me to do,
run the Barb with a pencil?

53:33.969 --> 53:36.278
I'm not afraid to try anything you did.

53:38.369 --> 53:42.328
I hate to tell you this,
but you're not the man I was.

53:42.569 --> 53:45.481
Copy me and you'll meet up
with somebody who'll break you.

53:45.569 --> 53:48.322
Stop acting like a crazy colt
and get a hold of yourself.

53:48.449 --> 53:51.202
Or you won't get a chance
to run this outfit at all.

53:51.329 --> 53:55.004
I didn't spend a lifetime building
this thing up for you to fritter it away.

53:55.089 --> 53:57.887
Now go over those beef tallies
like I told you to.

53:58.849 --> 54:00.487
I want to see you, Vic.

54:11.769 --> 54:12.838
Come here.

54:14.569 --> 54:16.799
Look out there. Tell me what you see.

54:19.329 --> 54:20.557
Same old mountains.

54:20.649 --> 54:22.719
Yeah. Any snow on them yet?

54:23.729 --> 54:25.367
What's the matter, Alec?

54:27.209 --> 54:29.598
I'm going blind, that's what's the matter.

54:29.689 --> 54:33.159
I own 100,000 acres
and I can't see more than 10 of them.

54:33.249 --> 54:34.568
Have you seen a doctor?

54:34.689 --> 54:35.917
Yeah, the best.

54:36.209 --> 54:38.643
That trip I made to Chicago
wasn't to sell beef.

54:38.729 --> 54:42.244
I went to see a specialist.
He said it's too late, nothing can be done.

54:42.329 --> 54:45.685
Six months to a year from now,
I won't even be able to shave myself.

54:45.769 --> 54:47.919
- Did you tell Dave?
- No, not yet.

54:48.249 --> 54:51.127
I'm telling you first
because I expect more from you.

54:51.609 --> 54:54.885
When they know I can't see,
the wolves will close in on this place...

54:54.969 --> 54:56.163
...and tear it to pieces.

54:56.249 --> 54:57.443
Don't worry.

54:57.529 --> 55:01.841
Anybody crossing our boundaries will grab
only enough land to bury themselves in.

55:02.129 --> 55:04.165
I know you can fight, Vic.

55:05.049 --> 55:07.927
But that's not enough, alone.
You've got to think.

55:08.769 --> 55:12.364
Even if you can't see,
you can still do the thinking for us.

55:13.369 --> 55:15.246
I've been pretty hard on you.

55:15.809 --> 55:17.720
Maybe harder than you deserve.

55:18.369 --> 55:21.406
Maybe I've been jealous
because you're not my son, too.

55:23.769 --> 55:25.248
Take care of my boy.

55:26.249 --> 55:27.967
Love him like a brother.

55:28.729 --> 55:30.720
And I'll love you like a son.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.365
All right, Pa.

55:41.969 --> 55:44.483
Take the east trail
up into the high country.

55:44.729 --> 55:47.562
You'll find some of my cattle
mixed in with the Barb herd.

55:47.649 --> 55:51.039
If we don't cut 'em out,
they'll end up wearing the Barb brand.

55:51.929 --> 55:54.887
All right, boss. I'll ride up and have a look.

55:57.489 --> 56:00.879
Keep your eye on the cattle.
Don't knife any more town drunks.

56:01.289 --> 56:02.722
Yes, ma'am.

56:27.969 --> 56:29.368
Give me the glass.

56:36.609 --> 56:38.361
It's Half Moon stock.

56:38.769 --> 56:40.964
- Come on, boys, let's corral 'em.
- Dave.

56:41.049 --> 56:44.564
- Alec said to let things sit for a while.
- They're grazing on Barb land.

56:44.649 --> 56:47.721
So they're eating a mouthful of grass.
We've got plenty growing.

56:47.809 --> 56:50.482
Alec said,
"If a steer swallows a blade of Barb grass...

56:50.569 --> 56:53.720
"...it becomes a Barb steer."
You trying to change that?

56:54.369 --> 56:57.167
No, I'm just trying to follow Alec's orders.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.519
I heard you talking to him in the parlour.

56:59.809 --> 57:01.208
I heard every word you said.

57:01.289 --> 57:04.201
You're trying to make me look weak
and yourself look strong.

57:04.289 --> 57:08.487
You got Alec believing you're a plaster:
well, I'll show him the cracks in you.

57:08.569 --> 57:10.480
Are you all finished, Dave?

57:11.449 --> 57:13.917
I'm finished talking, but I'm not finished.

57:14.009 --> 57:17.797
Until Alec changes things,
I'm telling the boys what to do.

57:18.609 --> 57:19.724
Not you.

57:19.849 --> 57:21.077
Go on, tell them.

57:21.169 --> 57:23.922
You're not going to give them orders
much longer.

57:25.689 --> 57:29.204
It won't take all of us to corral
a few steers. Ned and I can handle them.

57:29.289 --> 57:32.042
You and the rest of the boys
can take care of our stock.

57:32.129 --> 57:33.960
Come on, Ned.

58:06.329 --> 58:07.682
Hold it here, men.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.847
What are you doing on Barb land?

59:48.929 --> 59:51.079
I'm checking Half Moon stock.

59:52.569 --> 59:55.527
You got Dave in the hand.
Now there'll be the devil to pay.

59:55.609 --> 59:57.406
Take his gun from him.

01:00:02.449 --> 01:00:03.928
Give me his gun.

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:05.688
Give it to me!

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.358
Grab his arm.

01:00:07.449 --> 01:00:10.521
- You ain't going to kill him, Dave?
- Do like I tell you!

01:00:20.129 --> 01:00:21.881
Look at it, Lockhart.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.643
Look at it!

01:00:40.209 --> 01:00:41.847
Why, you scum!

01:00:57.489 --> 01:01:00.959
Shove him off our land.
I'm going to ride to town.

01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:10.847
Hold it, Lockhart.

01:01:11.049 --> 01:01:12.482
Get his horse.

01:04:39.249 --> 01:04:42.400
Have you gone crazy?
Put out that fire before the Apache see it.

01:04:42.489 --> 01:04:45.208
I want them to see it
and to come and get their guns.

01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:47.679
Get away from that fire, Vic.

01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:51.844
There's 200 repeating rifles in that wagon.

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:54.568
If the Apache get them,
they'll massacre the territory.

01:04:54.649 --> 01:04:57.561
By tomorrow, nothing will be left
of the Half Moon but ashes.

01:04:57.649 --> 01:04:59.048
You don't know the Apache.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:02.166
You can't make a deal to raid
the Half Moon and leave the Barb.

01:05:02.249 --> 01:05:04.717
Once they get those guns,
there's no stopping them.

01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:05.958
I don't care.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:10.082
Kate hired herself a gunfighter.
I'm hiring myself some Indians.

01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:13.288
Look at my hand. Look at it!

01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:16.398
It hurts. It hurts bad.

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:18.918
He did it and he's going to get his.

01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:22.720
Now, get back away from the fire.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:35.038
Listen, Dave, so far no one knows
we sold a few guns to the Apache.

01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:38.917
But turn loose 200 of these rifles,
you're going to start an Indian war.

01:05:39.009 --> 01:05:41.125
The Barb can handle it.
They won't attack us.

01:05:41.209 --> 01:05:44.201
- There's women and kids in Coronado.
- They're not mine.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:47.846
What about your father?
Supposing he finds out about this?

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:50.928
- Who's going to tell him? You?
- Yes!

01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:53.359
Put out that fire or I'll tell him.

01:05:53.489 --> 01:05:56.242
That's the last order you're giving me,
Mr. Hansbro.

01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:57.921
You, the old man, or anybody.

01:05:58.009 --> 01:06:01.001
You're all against me.
You've always been against me.

01:06:01.089 --> 01:06:04.559
Who is this Lockhart? How do I know
you didn't bring him here to gun me?

01:06:04.649 --> 01:06:06.799
I can't trust nobody no more.

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:08.807
I'm going to fix things my way.

01:06:08.929 --> 01:06:11.397
I'm gonna give the guns to the Apache.

01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:14.561
I'm going to get even.
I'll show you who's weak and who's strong.

01:06:14.649 --> 01:06:16.241
You're crazy!

01:06:38.209 --> 01:06:40.200
You hand me that towel, Barbara.

01:06:41.249 --> 01:06:43.365
Hold his arm steady now, because...

01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:45.840
...this is going to hurt.

01:06:49.569 --> 01:06:51.287
Have you done this before?

01:06:51.649 --> 01:06:55.244
I've patched up bullet holes
in places I wouldn't like to mention.

01:06:56.449 --> 01:06:59.168
It's the sort of stunt
Dave Waggoman would pull.

01:06:59.609 --> 01:07:01.042
Pity his ma isn't alive.

01:07:01.169 --> 01:07:04.047
She'd be real proud if she could see
the way he's turned out.

01:07:04.129 --> 01:07:05.881
Don't talk so much, Kate.

01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:11.363
Dave Waggoman's ma was a pretty
little piece of fluff from back East.

01:07:12.009 --> 01:07:15.365
She marched Alec to the altar
before he knew what struck him.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:18.168
When she found out
he was too much of a man for her...

01:07:18.249 --> 01:07:21.719
...she made certain that his son
didn't turn out to be like him.

01:07:22.969 --> 01:07:26.279
She petted and she pampered him
until he was spoiled rotten.

01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:30.439
You must have known him
before he was married.

01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:33.487
I was engaged to him. He stood me up...

01:07:33.769 --> 01:07:35.964
...that uncle of yours.
- You still love him.

01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:39.246
- After what he did to me?
- lf he asked you today, you'd marry him.

01:07:39.329 --> 01:07:42.207
Sure, but just to get my hands
on the Barb Ranch.

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:49.765
That ought to hold you.

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:53.209
That's a real professional job,
Miss Canaday.

01:07:53.649 --> 01:07:56.004
Looks like it's been done
by a good army surgeon.

01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:58.728
You've been treated by army surgeons,
Mr. Lockhart?

01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:00.447
I've seen them in action.

01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:02.804
I think we could all stand a pot of coffee.

01:08:02.889 --> 01:08:04.959
- Let me make it.
- No.

01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:08.684
You take Mr. Lockhart into the parlour
where he'll be more comfortable.

01:08:08.769 --> 01:08:10.168
Thank you.

01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:29.728
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't come here.

01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:32.607
My coming had nothing to do
with the trouble here.

01:08:32.889 --> 01:08:36.198
The seeds of it were planted
long before I ever heard of Coronado.

01:08:36.288 --> 01:08:37.926
I don't mean Coronado.

01:08:39.488 --> 01:08:40.968
I mean me.

01:08:41.969 --> 01:08:42.957
You?

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:45.884
What have I done to you, Miss Waggoman?

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:49.640
I was so sure and now I don't know.

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:52.524
You don't know about what?

01:08:53.089 --> 01:08:55.158
How I feel about everything.

01:08:56.769 --> 01:08:59.567
I'm very sorry if I've upset you,
Miss Waggoman.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.358
Stop calling me Miss Waggoman.

01:09:04.169 --> 01:09:06.160
Shall I call you Barbara?

01:09:09.889 --> 01:09:10.957
Don't go!

01:09:11.049 --> 01:09:12.960
- I mustn't stay.
- No, please.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:14.962
Just for a minute.

01:09:15.448 --> 01:09:18.645
I feel like something will be said
that shouldn't be said.

01:09:21.009 --> 01:09:24.444
You know, you've got orders
from Kate to entertain the patient.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:27.643
Please.

01:09:31.448 --> 01:09:32.564
All right.

01:09:42.488 --> 01:09:46.118
Did you know Daniel Boone was
84 years old when he crossed the Rockies?

01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:48.279
Yes, everybody knows that.

01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:51.564
I know all about Daniel Boone.

01:09:51.889 --> 01:09:53.800
How many children he had...

01:09:53.929 --> 01:09:56.238
...the towns that were named after him.

01:09:57.489 --> 01:09:58.968
Ask me, just ask me.

01:09:59.049 --> 01:10:00.607
Coffee's ready.

01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:03.085
Shall I serve it in here?

01:10:04.089 --> 01:10:06.762
I'd best be getting home
before it gets dark.

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:16.081
What did you say to her?

01:10:16.489 --> 01:10:19.367
I declare,
I can't understand that Waggoman family.

01:10:19.529 --> 01:10:22.680
- Barbara's the nice one.
- She sure is.

01:10:24.009 --> 01:10:25.647
We'll have a cup of coffee.

01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.882
Don't touch him.

01:11:57.289 --> 01:11:58.278
Who did it?

01:11:58.409 --> 01:12:01.765
It was Lockhart. He must've circled
around from Half Moon and waited.

01:12:01.849 --> 01:12:03.680
- Come on, boys.
- Hold it, Fritz.

01:12:03.769 --> 01:12:06.442
Alec's still the boss.
He's giving the orders.

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:08.804
What do we have to wait for?
We know he did it.

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:10.880
How do you know? Did you see him do it?

01:12:10.969 --> 01:12:14.041
- Who else could it be?
- That's for Alec to decide.

01:12:14.489 --> 01:12:16.923
Now, get back to the bunkhouse,
all of you!

01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:32.718
There now.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.044
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:36.323
I'll fix breakfast.

01:12:36.409 --> 01:12:38.639
- Bacon and eggs do?
- Yeah, fry 'em hard.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.242
Army style?

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:44.204
The army's a good place
for a fella that's alone. I kind of miss it.

01:12:44.289 --> 01:12:46.678
Why'd you ever leave it, then?

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.328
I'll get it.

01:12:52.529 --> 01:12:53.928
- 'Morning, Sheriff.
- 'Morning.

01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:57.001
- 'Morning, Kate.
- Come in, Tom. What's the trouble?

01:12:57.889 --> 01:12:59.641
Dave Waggoman's dead.

01:13:00.929 --> 01:13:04.285
- How'd it happen?
- That's why I'm here, to try and find out.

01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:07.566
I heard what Dave did to you,
and maybe you had good cause...

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.765
...but killing's killing.
- I didn't kill him.

01:13:09.849 --> 01:13:12.682
He headed for town, I came here.
His men'll tell you that.

01:13:12.769 --> 01:13:14.646
You could've doubled back and met him.

01:13:14.729 --> 01:13:16.924
- I didn't kill him.
- I don't believe you did...

01:13:17.009 --> 01:13:19.364
...but the men at the Barb think different.

01:13:19.449 --> 01:13:22.043
Vic's holding them down.
How long he can, I don't know.

01:13:22.129 --> 01:13:23.403
How's Alec taken it?

01:13:23.569 --> 01:13:26.641
He just sits there in the parlour
staring at Dave's body.

01:13:31.089 --> 01:13:34.877
When he comes out of his shock,
I wouldn't give a plug nickel for your life.

01:13:34.969 --> 01:13:37.688
I'm not running away
from something I didn't do.

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.999
I rode all the way out here
just to warn you.

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:42.727
I guess the rest is up to you.

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:46.324
You tell Alec Waggoman
I'll be right here if he wants to see me.

01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:05.763
I feel real sorry about Dave, Alec.

01:15:16.369 --> 01:15:19.281
- I'm going with you, Alec.
- It was my son he killed.

01:15:19.369 --> 01:15:22.486
- You're no match for Lockhart.
- I've got to do this alone.

01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:24.919
I don't want anybody following me.

01:15:25.409 --> 01:15:27.286
Stay in town, all of you!

01:15:57.369 --> 01:15:58.927
Hold it, Waggoman!

01:15:59.569 --> 01:16:02.367
- Is that you, Lockhart?
- I'm right here.

01:16:23.969 --> 01:16:25.721
You think I killed your boy?

01:16:25.809 --> 01:16:27.686
Go ahead, even the score.

01:16:27.769 --> 01:16:29.805
You came here to kill, didn't you?

01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:33.768
There's just one man I have reason to kill
and I haven't found him yet.

01:16:34.209 --> 01:16:35.528
Take your gun.

01:16:35.769 --> 01:16:38.078
You'll need it the next time I see you.

01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:42.527
You've got to believe me. I didn't do it.

01:16:43.409 --> 01:16:45.843
I'm not the man in your dream,
Mr. Waggoman.

01:17:22.849 --> 01:17:23.998
Sit down, Vic.

01:17:28.529 --> 01:17:30.963
You shouldn't be doing bookwork
with your eyes.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:32.198
Sit down.

01:17:32.809 --> 01:17:36.040
I've just finished going over bills
for the past six months...

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:40.608
...and I found we ordered a wagonload
of fence wire from New Orleans.

01:17:40.809 --> 01:17:42.800
Since when do we use fence wire?

01:17:43.529 --> 01:17:45.804
We paid for a wagonload we didn't get.

01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:48.398
It's too much money for fence wire.

01:17:49.809 --> 01:17:52.118
There was something else in that wagon.

01:17:52.929 --> 01:17:56.285
- Are you asking or telling me, Alec?
- I just want the truth.

01:17:56.369 --> 01:17:59.600
You don't have to defend Dave any longer.
I just want to know.

01:17:59.689 --> 01:18:02.123
A wagonload of supplies is quite an item.

01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:05.044
Why didn't you tell me it was missing?

01:18:05.769 --> 01:18:08.886
How could I?
What could I say, "Your son is a thief"?

01:18:09.209 --> 01:18:12.804
We're alone in this room, Vic.
We don't have to hide our feelings.

01:18:13.049 --> 01:18:16.724
If you think Dave was selling guns
to the Apache, I want to know it.

01:18:17.089 --> 01:18:21.162
Dave was wild, yes,
but he wouldn't do a thing like that.

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:22.967
No, not that.

01:18:25.129 --> 01:18:26.357
Say something!

01:18:28.689 --> 01:18:31.328
If you want me to agree with you,
I'll agree with you.

01:18:31.409 --> 01:18:34.162
I've got to know for sure.
This I've got to know.

01:18:34.369 --> 01:18:37.122
- We're going to find that wagon.
- Forget about it.

01:18:37.209 --> 01:18:40.246
How can I? All I've got left to hang onto
are a few memories.

01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:43.241
If he was selling guns to the Apaches,
I don't even have that.

01:18:43.329 --> 01:18:45.843
Nobody said there were guns
in that wagon.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:48.966
I can't live with a lie.
I've got to know one way or the other.

01:18:49.049 --> 01:18:52.359
There are not so many places
they can hide a wagon in this country.

01:18:52.449 --> 01:18:53.438
We'll find it.

01:18:54.289 --> 01:18:57.520
Supposing we find that wagon?
Supposing there are guns in it?

01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:59.679
Will that make you feel any better?

01:18:59.929 --> 01:19:03.763
Yes, because then I'll know
the man I buried was not my son...

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:06.002
...just a stranger.

01:19:44.089 --> 01:19:46.728
Looks like you've been sitting there
for two weeks.

01:19:46.809 --> 01:19:49.846
Yeah, and I just ate a pound of dust
with this can of beans.

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:53.082
- You got yourself in a real box this time.
- Yeah.

01:19:53.329 --> 01:19:56.002
Someone sure is doing a fine job
of messing me up.

01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:57.807
You've decided to go back to Laramie?

01:19:57.889 --> 01:19:59.641
Still trying to get rid of me, huh?

01:19:59.729 --> 01:20:02.527
No, sir. This is just one more reason
for me staying.

01:20:03.609 --> 01:20:05.327
I found some wagon tracks.

01:20:05.649 --> 01:20:07.879
- Where?
- Right along this creek here...

01:20:08.049 --> 01:20:12.122
...due south of them mountains.
Peculiar thing, only found one single track.

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:15.125
One and only one wagon got through.

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:18.884
- Where were they headed, Apache land?
- Seemed like they were headed nowhere.

01:20:18.969 --> 01:20:21.688
I lost the trail
right at the foot of the mountains.

01:20:22.329 --> 01:20:24.285
Let's see if we can pick it up.

01:20:45.089 --> 01:20:48.047
You couldn't hide a stray dog down there,
let alone a wagon...

01:20:48.129 --> 01:20:51.121
...even from my eyes.
Must be up above somewhere.

01:20:51.409 --> 01:20:53.047
How could a wagon get up there?

01:20:53.129 --> 01:20:55.359
There'd have to be a trail, plenty wide.

01:20:55.449 --> 01:20:57.883
I know every foot of these rocks.
We'll find it.

01:20:58.009 --> 01:21:00.159
Let's go back.
We're not doing any good here.

01:21:00.249 --> 01:21:02.763
Even if the wagon's there,
you don't want to find it.

01:21:02.889 --> 01:21:06.006
You can go back if you want to.
I'll find it myself.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.282
Don't go any further.

01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.485
What is it you don't want me to find?

01:21:42.609 --> 01:21:45.169
I lied to you.
I didn't find Dave's body on the trail.

01:21:45.249 --> 01:21:47.968
- Why would you lie about that?
- I found him near the guns.

01:21:48.049 --> 01:21:51.644
- I didn't want you to find out.
- When a man starts lying, he can't stop.

01:21:51.769 --> 01:21:53.964
- What else are you hiding?
- Listen to me.

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:57.963
My whole life,
I've worked and sweated blood for you.

01:21:58.169 --> 01:22:00.922
I was the only son you ever had,
but you couldn't see me.

01:22:01.009 --> 01:22:03.204
Half the time
you never even knew I was there.

01:22:03.289 --> 01:22:06.326
I loved you like only a boy
who never had a father could.

01:22:06.409 --> 01:22:08.684
So, I'm asking you once more, don't go.

01:22:09.129 --> 01:22:10.881
I will see what's on that plateau.

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:13.722
- Listen to me, you old fool...
- Take your hands off me!

01:22:13.969 --> 01:22:15.607
I tell you, don't go!

01:22:43.609 --> 01:22:48.080
That wagon must've been loaded heavy.
Look how deep those tracks are.

01:22:49.569 --> 01:22:52.288
This is where it ends,
right here in the creek.

01:22:53.369 --> 01:22:57.157
You go downstream there,
and I'll go up the draw here.

01:24:20.849 --> 01:24:22.248
How is he?

01:24:22.929 --> 01:24:26.365
- Still unconscious.
- Keep nothing from us. We want to know.

01:24:27.449 --> 01:24:28.882
Alec's strong.

01:24:29.049 --> 01:24:31.483
He's got a fair chance to pull through,
but...

01:24:31.569 --> 01:24:33.924
Finish what you started to say.

01:24:34.489 --> 01:24:35.604
He's blind.

01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:39.127
It's no surprise,
his sight's been failing for years.

01:24:39.209 --> 01:24:41.439
The fall just hurried it up, that's all.

01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:45.322
I'm real curious to find out
who pushed him.

01:24:45.729 --> 01:24:47.845
- Pushed him?
- You don't think he fell?

01:24:47.929 --> 01:24:50.397
With his eyes,
he had no business on a horse.

01:24:50.489 --> 01:24:53.208
There's nothing wrong
with his horse's eyesight.

01:24:54.409 --> 01:24:56.001
Somebody pushed him all right.

01:24:56.089 --> 01:24:58.398
The same one who killed
Dave and Chris Boldt.

01:24:58.489 --> 01:24:59.638
Who?

01:24:59.889 --> 01:25:02.483
I'm afraid Alec is the only one
who can tell us that.

01:25:02.569 --> 01:25:04.480
I have another call to make.

01:25:05.089 --> 01:25:07.000
Sit with him until I get back.

01:25:16.089 --> 01:25:18.205
You already know who it is, don't you?

01:25:18.289 --> 01:25:21.440
- What makes you say that?
- lf you do, I want you to tell me.

01:25:21.529 --> 01:25:24.487
If I knew,
I wouldn't be waiting for Alec to come to.

01:25:28.369 --> 01:25:29.722
What are you afraid of?

01:25:29.849 --> 01:25:32.124
- Why should I be afraid?
- I don't know.

01:25:36.289 --> 01:25:40.043
- I don't know, but you are.
- I knew it'd come to this. It just had to.

01:25:40.129 --> 01:25:42.848
It didn't have to.
Somebody made it happen.

01:25:43.689 --> 01:25:46.203
When my father was dying,
he told me to leave.

01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:50.282
He said everything here was built on greed,
killing, and that it'd go on that way.

01:25:50.369 --> 01:25:53.247
I wouldn't listen.
I saw only what I wanted to see.

01:25:56.449 --> 01:25:59.441
Tell me what you're thinking.
I've got to know.

01:26:03.329 --> 01:26:04.523
I'm not sure.

01:26:30.569 --> 01:26:33.606
I came as soon as I heard. How did he die?

01:26:33.929 --> 01:26:36.682
He's not dead, Vic. Not yet.

01:26:38.009 --> 01:26:41.684
- How did it happen?
- We don't know. He's still unconscious.

01:26:41.769 --> 01:26:43.600
- Maybe I can get him to...
- Take it easy.

01:26:43.689 --> 01:26:47.523
- I've got to see him. I've got to know.
- The doc says his chances are just fair.

01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:50.999
He may not wake up at all.
You barging in there won't help things any.

01:26:51.089 --> 01:26:53.603
Why don't you pour yourself
a cup of coffee?

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:11.208
I heard he fell.

01:27:11.449 --> 01:27:14.600
But Alec was too good a horseman
to fall out of a saddle.

01:27:15.569 --> 01:27:18.606
Do you have any idea
who'd want to get rid of the old man?

01:27:18.929 --> 01:27:22.365
Alec made a lot of enemies
when he was building up the Barb...

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:26.161
...but that was long ago.

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:32.968
- lf I could just see him...
- Just sit down and relax.

01:27:33.049 --> 01:27:34.721
Kate's in there with him.

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:10.647
I can get him to talk.
I know him better than anybody else.

01:28:10.769 --> 01:28:12.805
Lockhart, he's asking for you.

01:28:17.809 --> 01:28:18.958
Who's there?

01:28:20.369 --> 01:28:22.360
It's Will Lockhart, Mr. Waggoman.

01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:23.764
Good.

01:28:24.249 --> 01:28:26.444
Good. Come over here, Lockhart.

01:28:27.209 --> 01:28:28.847
Come here, close to me.

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:34.198
Sit down.

01:28:36.969 --> 01:28:39.608
I got going over those old bills.

01:28:39.929 --> 01:28:42.363
I found out about the shipment of rifles.

01:28:43.529 --> 01:28:45.281
He made Dave do it.

01:28:46.009 --> 01:28:48.079
He made Dave sign the order, too.

01:28:49.209 --> 01:28:51.359
He wouldn't tell me where they were...

01:28:52.249 --> 01:28:55.047
...but I know every hiding spot
in this country.

01:28:57.129 --> 01:28:58.482
He killed Dave.

01:28:59.409 --> 01:29:01.400
He tried to kill me, too.

01:29:01.489 --> 01:29:02.558
Who?

01:29:04.169 --> 01:29:05.921
The man in my dream.

01:29:06.929 --> 01:29:09.397
He didn't come from far away
to kill my boy.

01:29:10.889 --> 01:29:12.959
He was right here, in my house...

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:16.443
...pretending he loved me like a son.

01:29:18.049 --> 01:29:19.038
Vic.

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.439
That's the man you're looking for.

01:30:14.649 --> 01:30:17.163
Where are you, Kate?

01:30:26.609 --> 01:30:29.123
Here I am, Alec.

01:30:32.649 --> 01:30:34.082
Don't go away, Kate.

01:30:34.809 --> 01:30:36.686
I've never left you, Alec.

01:32:44.929 --> 01:32:46.248
Hold it, Vic.

01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:49.162
Unbuckle your belt.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:55.763
Turn around.

01:32:59.569 --> 01:33:02.481
I came 1,000 miles to kill you, Hansbro.

01:33:03.289 --> 01:33:06.645
- You're crazy! I never did anything to you.
- I'm not going to rush it.

01:33:06.729 --> 01:33:09.687
- I've waited a long time for this.
- What are you talking about?

01:33:09.769 --> 01:33:12.488
I never laid eyes on you
till that day at the salt flats.

01:33:12.609 --> 01:33:15.487
- You've got no cause to shoot me.
- Shooting's too good for you.

01:33:15.569 --> 01:33:17.127
What did I do to you?

01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:19.359
Tell me, I've got a right to know.

01:33:19.929 --> 01:33:23.365
I guess a man's got a right to know
what he's going to die for.

01:33:23.489 --> 01:33:26.845
- The Dutch Creek massacre.
- I wasn't there. I never even heard of it.

01:33:26.929 --> 01:33:30.808
My brother was there, along with
a whole patrol of kids just like him.

01:33:31.329 --> 01:33:35.766
You sold the Apaches the guns they used.
It's as if you pulled the trigger yourself.

01:33:36.609 --> 01:33:37.803
Give me a chance!

01:33:37.889 --> 01:33:40.722
I'll give you
the same chance you gave Alec.

01:33:46.489 --> 01:33:49.799
They're coming for their guns.
Kill me and they'll kill you.

01:33:55.769 --> 01:33:57.202
Get over behind that wagon.

01:33:57.289 --> 01:34:00.486
- What are you going to do?
- Do as I tell you! Get over there.

01:34:01.489 --> 01:34:03.684
Kick that rock out from under that wheel.

01:34:03.769 --> 01:34:05.600
Get the wagon moving. Push!

01:34:24.929 --> 01:34:26.647
Come on, get back here.

01:34:27.089 --> 01:34:28.488
They paid for these guns.

01:34:28.569 --> 01:34:31.037
- lf they don't get them, they'll kill us.
- Push!

01:34:40.369 --> 01:34:42.280
Get up that front wheel.

01:34:46.089 --> 01:34:47.647
Pull up on that wheel.

01:34:47.729 --> 01:34:49.367
Come on, do as I say! Harder!

01:34:52.609 --> 01:34:53.928
Come on, harder!

01:35:01.289 --> 01:35:02.768
Come on, back here.

01:35:48.129 --> 01:35:49.482
Get away from me.

01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:52.088
Get away from me.

01:36:25.769 --> 01:36:27.964
I feel like such a fool. At my age, too.

01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:31.007
You look like a bride.
When's the wedding?

01:36:31.089 --> 01:36:33.239
Just as soon as he's well enough
to stand up.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:35.763
That won't be very long.
He's sitting up now.

01:36:35.849 --> 01:36:38.124
Where are you, Kate?

01:36:38.929 --> 01:36:41.238
He needs me. Isn't that wonderful?

01:36:50.609 --> 01:36:53.407
- Good-bye, Miss Waggoman.
- Good-bye, Mr. Lockhart.

01:37:00.489 --> 01:37:03.799
When you go East,
you'll pass through Laramie.

01:37:04.409 --> 01:37:08.766
If you should ask for a Captain Lockhart,
anyone will tell you where to find me.

01:37:09.129 --> 01:37:10.562
I'll remember that.

01:38:03.129 --> 01:38:05.120
