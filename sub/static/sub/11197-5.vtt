00:36.840 --> 00:37.800
Hello.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
- Is this Major Samantha Carter?.
- Who is this?

00:40.840 --> 00:44.440
My name is Richard Flemming.
You don't know me, but l need your help.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.160
- lt's two in the morning.
- l know what happened to you.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.240
l know about Adrian Conrad.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.320
- Who are you?
- They never shut the project down,

00:56.400 --> 00:58.640
- and now it's out of control.
- What project?

00:58.760 --> 01:00.880
You have to protect me. They know l...

01:04.319 --> 01:06.480
Hello? Hello?

02:18.640 --> 02:20.640
His name is Dr Richard Flemming.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.840
He's a biologist, formally a professor
of advanced genetics at Stanford.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.120
He's famous for developing hybrid strains
of disease-resistant corn and cotton.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.480
l read an article on him in The American
Journal for Evolutionary Science.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
The base library has a subscription.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.600
Well, what the article didn't say is that
two years ago he accepted a position

02:47.680 --> 02:50.040
with a company
called lmmunitech Research,

02:50.160 --> 02:54.400
which, it turns out, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zetatron lndustries.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.480
Adrian Conrad.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.920
Who?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.240
You don't know?

03:03.280 --> 03:07.120
Adrian Conrad was a man who had
himself implanted with a stolen symbiote

03:07.240 --> 03:10.080
in order to cure himself
of a deadly disease.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.400
That was ten months ago. At the time
lmmunitech was located in Phoenix.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.640
One week after we took Adrian Conrad
into custody, operations were scaled back

03:18.760 --> 03:22.800
and they moved to a small town
on the coast of Oregon called Steveston.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.800
We need to talk to this Dr Flemming.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.240
He was reported missing this morning.
They found his car totalled, but no body.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.880
This warrants further investigation.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.080
l'll have transportation
arranged for the three of you.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.000
Colonel O'Neill won't join us?

03:40.080 --> 03:43.600
The Tok'ra are still looking for
a suitable host for his symbiote.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.880
You'll have to do your best
without him. Dismissed.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.280
You knew who Adrian Conrad was,
didn't you?

03:57.360 --> 04:03.040
l've memorised all mission reports. l just
don't want people thinking l'm... strange.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.080
People don't think you're strange.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.080
What about Colonel O'Neill?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.440
Let's get some lunch.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.960
- What are you doing?
- Keeping a visual record.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.000
l'll catalogue the images
when we get back to the base.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.920
Teal'c.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.720
See? The image appears
right there on the back.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.920
l'm gonna go talk to the sheriff.
Keep an eye on Teal'c.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.280
Keep an eye on Jonas.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.280
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi. Can l help you?

05:09.360 --> 05:13.120
Major Samantha Carter with the Air Force.
l'm looking for Sheriff Knox.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.360
l'm Sheriff Knox.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.200
Welcome to Steveston, Major.
Hey, those doughnuts? Want anything?

05:19.480 --> 05:21.440
Oh, no, thank you.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.920
Sure thing.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.120
Have a seat, Major.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.080
So, you're looking for information
about Dr Richard Flemming.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.640
That's right. l understand he's missing.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.480
We found his car in a ditch
outside of town.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.920
lt was pretty badly smashed up,
but there was no sign of him.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.160
Can l see the car?

05:55.040 --> 06:00.640
- You think he walked away from this?
- Look, no offence, but this is my problem.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.880
The Air Force has no jurisdiction here.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.920
l know l can't force you
to tell me anything,

06:10.000 --> 06:15.360
but Flemming may have had information
pertaining to a matter of national security.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.640
l'm asking for your help.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.560
We haven't had a murder
in this county in eight years.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.040
So you don't think it was an accident?

06:29.160 --> 06:32.560
Well, at the very least,
someone didn't want us to find the body.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.640
Did you know him?

06:36.720 --> 06:40.320
The people at lmmunitech
didn't mix too much with the locals,

06:40.400 --> 06:44.880
but according to his co-workers
he was acting a little strange lately.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.760
- Strange, how?
- Nervous, agitated.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.840
We found these in his glove compartment.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.040
- Amphetamines.
- He had no history of drug use.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.280
l'd like to see his lab, if l may.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.600
There was a fire last night at lmmunitech.
The place was gutted.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.400
Flemming's lab was destroyed in a fire.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.280
- So what now?
- We check out his house.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.680
- Find anything?
- Nothing of interest.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.200
Me neither. There's nothing on
the hard drive, there's no disks, no notes.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.400
There's not even a credit-card bill.
This place has been cleaned.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.480
Major Carter.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.920
- Can you sign for this?
- Uh, sure.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.520
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.800
- Well, this is odd.
- What is it?

09:21.880 --> 09:26.360
This package to Dr Richard Flemming
was sent from Dr Richard Flemming.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.480
- Why'd he send something to himself?
- Maybe he knew they'd search the house.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.920
lt's a good way to hide something
for a couple of days.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.920
Police found amphetamines.
We found a syringe.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.480
There's a possibility Flemming suffered
from some kind of drug-induced paranoia.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.480
Perhaps his paranoia was well-founded.
He is missing.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.640
His place of work was destroyed and
all evidence was removed from his home.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.640
Conrad's scientists were studying this
symbiote to create a kind of superdrug.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.000
Maybe this is what they came up with.

10:36.760 --> 10:41.640
Well, if that's true, then a lot of people
would kill to get their hands on it.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.520
We won't know anything for sure until
we send a sample of this back to base.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.480
Tomorrow we'll talk to
other people at lmmunitech.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.560
We need to figure out
what was going on at that lab.

11:34.680 --> 11:40.760
As some of you may already know,
we have three uninvited guests in town.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.240
They are asking questions.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.360
The chances are they won't find anything.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.240
But if they do,

11:51.560 --> 11:53.920
then we will have to deal with them.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.800
Hey.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.440
Mm.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.200
Nice lunch.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.080
Mm. l'm really starting to enjoy
this traditional American food. Mm.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.240
We have another tradition.
lt's called hardened arteries.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.240
- Were you able to learn anything?
- No one at lmmunitech wants to talk.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.240
Our attempts to gather information
from locals prove equally fruitless.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.480
l wouldn't say that.

12:50.680 --> 12:55.040
Don't tell me you haven't noticed how
strangely people have been acting here.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.120
What are you talking about?

12:57.200 --> 13:01.360
Well, for instance,
that man there, right behind Teal'c.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.560
He doesn't realise it,
but he put eight sugars in his coffee.

13:04.640 --> 13:09.840
And that lady over at the counter has been
reading the same article for half an hour.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.680
Since we sat down,
that waitress has dropped her tray twice,

13:13.760 --> 13:16.800
the cook has gotten three orders wrong,
including my burger,

13:16.920 --> 13:19.520
which l ordered medium-rare,
but is well-done.

13:19.600 --> 13:24.800
l've been noticing similar behaviour all
morning. lt's like the town's half-asleep.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.480
Major Carter, sorry to bother you.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.720
Sheriff Knox would like to see you.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.960
You and your colleagues have been
asking questions around town.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.360
Yeah. ls that a problem?

13:45.120 --> 13:48.800
We found gasoline residue at the lab.
A lot of it.

13:48.920 --> 13:53.600
- So the fire was deliberate.
- lt means the stakes have gotten higher.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.880
- lf you know something...
- Sheriff, l already told you.

13:56.960 --> 14:02.320
- My investigation pertains to a matter of...
- National security. l know.

14:02.440 --> 14:07.040
- l didn't get any useful information today.
- l'm not surprised.

14:07.120 --> 14:12.160
Everyone at the lab had a confidentiality
agreement. Nobody wants to get sued.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.160
Now we know it was arson, maybe
the company will be willing to cooperate.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.320
l wouldn't be too sure about that.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.720
Well, they're gonna wanna know
who burned their lab down.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.040
There's something you don't know.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.720
Two months ago, another lmmunitech
researcher named Peter Stofer vanished.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.520
- The case was never solved.
- Why didn't you tell me?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.800
The town's been through
some rough times, Major.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.240
Shipyard shut down two years ago,
put everybody out of work.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.360
When lmmunitech came,
they brought a lot of money to the area.

14:45.480 --> 14:51.360
- So nobody says anything bad about 'em.
- There was no solid evidence of foul play.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.680
Stofer just didn't show up for work
one day and hasn't been seen since.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.760
But l did get the feeling
the company had something to hide.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.000
What do you mean?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.360
We subpoenaed documents from them.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.200
This is what we got.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.000
Did Stofer work with Dr Flemming?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.480
They were partners.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.000
l'm gonna need to borrow these.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.280
Well, this is interesting.
lt's a shipping invoice.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.280
Flemming and Stofer ordered all
the latest material on stem-cell research.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.080
Really? Hm.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.760
There's no record of lmmunitech
doing research in that area.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.400
- l know.
- Why would they keep that a secret?

15:53.520 --> 15:56.560
Stem cells can be used
to create skin grafts or organs,

15:56.640 --> 16:01.280
but, theoretically, they can also
be used to create human clones.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.600
Which is illegal.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.120
So if they were cloning and
Flemming decided to blow the whistle...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.360
He would have to be silenced.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.440
But why would he call you?

16:13.520 --> 16:17.200
lt must have something
to do with Adrian Conrad.

16:17.880 --> 16:22.080
We should go through the rest
of this stuff, see if anything turns up.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.840
This town certainly
does get quiet at night.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.360
Evening.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.680
What can l get you?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.680
Ginger ale.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.359
l'll have the same.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.000
lt does not appear we are welcome.

17:26.119 --> 17:30.680
Well, it's natural for small-town people
to be suspicious of strangers, right?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.200
We just have to give it more of an effort.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.840
Hey, guys.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.400
- You have much to learn about humans.
- That's kind of my point.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.680
How are we supposed to fit in
when we spend all our time on base?

18:04.160 --> 18:05.360
Thanks.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.360
- l have a sufficient grasp of Earth culture.
- But you'll never be one of them.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.280
This is not my home.

18:17.360 --> 18:22.360
When my time with SG-1 is done,
l will return to Chulak with my son.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.560
l guess that's the difference between us.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.880
l don't think l'll be able to go back.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.960
You're in our seats.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.640
There are many empty seats.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.760
But these are ours.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.480
ls there a problem here?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.880
No.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.120
Apparently we were in their seats.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.480
- What was that?
- They're not fit to be in our presence.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.360
lf you do anything
to jeopardise this operation,

19:41.480 --> 19:43.680
l will kill you myself.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.880
l spoke with Janet this morning. She did a
preliminary analysis on the sample l sent.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.320
She thinks the liquid in the syringe might
be some sort of sulphur-based antibiotic.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.560
So, some kind of miracle drug.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.880
We won't know anything for sure
until we get more test results back.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.200
That's the guy from the bar.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.080
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.800
Sorry about our...
misunderstanding last night.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.120
- Excuse me?
- At the bar, our little confrontation.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.600
My friend and l were in your seats.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.080
l'm afraid you've got me mistaken
for someone else.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.480
l don't think so.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.120
Last night l was home in bed.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.560
That's a little strange.
He didn't seem to remember us.

20:57.680 --> 21:02.400
- Perhaps he'd had too much alcohol.
- l thought of that, but he wasn't hungover.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.800
- Or didn't tell his wife he was in the bar.
- He didn't have a wedding ring.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.000
We are being watched.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.200
The silver car.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.440
He's from the sheriff's office.
He was outside when we first got in town.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.960
He was in the restaurant yesterday.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.280
OK, take it easy.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.360
- Why are you following us?
- l don't know what you mean.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.640
- Teal'c.
- All right, all right, all right

21:58.760 --> 22:01.520
- l wasn't sure if you could be trusted.
- With what?

22:03.600 --> 22:06.880
l was a security guard at lmmunitech.

22:09.400 --> 22:13.520
- I think Dr Flemming was murdered.
- Why would you say that?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.120
About a week ago he wanted to know
if l could get him a gun.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.560
Said he was in danger and
l was the only one that could help him.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.040
- Why you?
- Well, that's the weird part.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.680
He said the people after him only come
out at night while everyone's asleep.

22:27.800 --> 22:32.000
Since l worked a graveyard shift,
l guess he figured l wasn't one of 'em.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.320
First l thought that he was crazy,

22:36.400 --> 22:38.400
and then he went missing.

22:38.480 --> 22:42.560
That's when l decided that working
for lmmunitech was a little too dangerous.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.280
Why didn't you tell the sheriff?

22:45.400 --> 22:48.400
Flemming said that
no one in the town could be trusted,

22:48.520 --> 22:51.440
but l figured l owed the guy
to tell someone.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.960
lf it hadn't been for him,
l would have died in that fire.

23:00.920 --> 23:05.440
''They only come out at night.''
What exactly is that supposed to mean?

23:05.520 --> 23:09.680
Maybe this has something to do with
what happened to us at the bar.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.680
- What did happen to you at the bar?
- We were met with hostility.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.080
You didn't say anything weird, did you?

23:18.160 --> 23:20.320
Why are you looking at me?

23:21.600 --> 23:24.480
Anyway, random aggressiveness
in a bar isn't unusual.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.040
But why didn't the man remember me?

23:27.120 --> 23:29.760
- Are you sure it was the same guy?
- Positive.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.680
Jonas Quinn is correct.
lt was the same man.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.520
You said there was evidence Flemming
and Stofer were researching cloning.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.640
No. There was evidence
they were reading up on stem cells.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.760
Which can be used
to create human clones.

23:44.360 --> 23:49.280
What if the man doesn't remember
because the man in the bar wasn't him?

23:52.080 --> 23:56.800
- He was a clone.
- No, you can't create fully grown people.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.040
They'd be infants.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.000
Still, the people of this town
are behaving strangely.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.840
Even for humans.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.040
The town's been through a lot.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.640
First the shipyard was shut down,
then the lab was destroyed.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.680
The entire future of the town's
in jeopardy.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.880
What?

24:26.440 --> 24:30.400
- You noticed these marks from the road?
- l didn't think much of 'em at the time.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.440
This area has been well travelled,
and recently.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.560
There are many footprints
as well as tyre tracks.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.240
Let's check it out.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.200
You have got
to teach me how to do that.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.240
Wormhole theory,
motorcycle riding and lock-picking.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.720
Not necessarily in that order.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.480
ln there.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.760
Somebody's been busy.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.200
These appear to be schematics.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.480
Yeah, but for what?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.360
l got a pretty good idea.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.880
Near as we can tell, sir, it's some
kind of alien ship, partially constructed.

26:35.920 --> 26:40.560
No, sir. We shouldn't do anything drastic
until we have more information.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.560
Yes, sir. Understood.

26:43.840 --> 26:48.640
Hammond won't call in the troops until we
figure out who built this thing and why.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.960
All the disks we got from the shipyard
are encoded. l can't read any of them.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.040
- Let me try.
- Yeah.

26:59.880 --> 27:03.440
Adrian Conrad illegally acquired
a symbiote from Colonel Maybourne.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.480
lt is possible he also
acquired alien technology.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.400
l don't know. This is unlike anything
the Russians or the NlD ever had.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.080
Then there must be
an alien presence in town.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.680
lt looks that way,
but how did they get here?

27:17.280 --> 27:22.640
- lt is not probable they used the Stargate.
- lf they came by ship, why build another?

27:22.760 --> 27:25.840
Perhaps an accident or a malfunction.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.720
They're not finished,
which means they'll be back.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.840
My guess is they work
under the cover of darkness.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.880
They only come out at night.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.200
OK. l think l can break this code,
but it's gonna take a while.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.280
Teal'c, is there any activity?

28:01.920 --> 28:04.880
Negative. How is the
decryption progressing?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.640
Slowly.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.120
Something's happening.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.120
Here we go.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.400
Oh, my God.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.080
Teal'c, come in.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.080
Major Carter. Many of the townspeople
have arrived at the shipyard.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.320
They're Goa'uld. Repeat;
the people building the ship are Goa'uld.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.880
- How is that possible?
- Flemming and Stofer were cloning,

29:34.960 --> 29:37.520
only it was Adrian Conrad's
symbiote they cloned.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.800
- Why did we not sense them?
- There's no naqahdah in their blood.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.920
There's way too many of 'em.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.280
Get back here.
l'll see if l can translate more.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.760
Affirmative.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.200
Hold it. Leave the weapons on the dash.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.800
Put your hands in the air
and get out of the car.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.600
- What is this?
- Get in the van.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.120
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the motel.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.760
We want you out of town by daybreak.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.640
l'm Agent Cross. That's Agent Singer.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.640
NlD.

31:35.560 --> 31:40.000
- So you know what's going on here?
- We've monitored it for three months.

31:40.600 --> 31:45.600
- They are waiting till the ship is complete.
- lt'll be our first line of planetary defence.

31:45.720 --> 31:50.480
- You set this whole thing up?
- No, just took advantage of the situation.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.920
lmmunitech cloned the symbiotes,
then there was an accident.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.680
We figure Flemming got infected,
then went after the other townspeople.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.920
Flemming is the one who tipped us off.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
The symbiotes are immature. They are
too weak to assert permanent control.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.400
But when the hosts go to sleep
they take over.

32:06.480 --> 32:10.080
When people wake up the next morning
they're tired, but none the wiser.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.200
That's why Flemming
was on amphetamines.

32:13.320 --> 32:18.160
- You get a ship, but what of the people?
- We have ways of dealing with them.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.920
- We will report this to SGC.
- Go ahead. This is no rogue operation.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.440
We have the full support of our superiors.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.480
When it is over, we'll have succeeded
where the SGC failed for five years.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.920
We have all the angles covered.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.080
Sam?

33:34.760 --> 33:36.560
Sam?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.560
They took her.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.560
- You have to do something.
- We've a containment team on stand-by.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.440
We can have this town
quarantined in 45 minutes.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.120
Then do so.

34:01.080 --> 34:05.600
Your operation is blown, Agent Cross.
The symbiotes know we're onto 'em.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.800
This is Cross. We have a code six.
l repeat- a code six.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.440
This is not a drill.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.880
We just lost 500 years
of technical advancement.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.960
It's much worse than that.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.800
Sam.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
You all right?

34:45.760 --> 34:47.360
What's going on?

34:49.480 --> 34:51.840
You should only speak when spoken to.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.880
OK.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.880
Welcome, brother.

35:25.960 --> 35:30.000
- Do you know where you are?
- l have the memories of my host.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.880
Good. When the
containment team gets here,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.960
you and Singer will take the symbiotes
and report back to NlD headquarters.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.480
- What about the rest of us?
- We'll be detained.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.800
lt'll only be a matter of days before
we've taken control of the organisation.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.880
That's an ambitious plan.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.800
Easy, OK? Sorry.

35:55.040 --> 35:59.040
The irony is we only wanted
to get off this pathetic planet.

35:59.360 --> 36:04.080
But when we realised they were
watching us, we came up with a new plan.

36:11.520 --> 36:16.160
Wait Major Carter was
writing a report on her computer.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.880
lt would be better if
the containment team didn't find it.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.200
Get the computer first.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.160
Should we use these two as hosts?

36:36.200 --> 36:38.160
No.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.280
This one is Jaffa.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.760
Shol'va.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.000
You should be serving your god.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.960
Apophis, the false god, is dead.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.640
Really?

36:55.240 --> 36:57.120
What about this one?

36:57.240 --> 37:00.480
He's an alien.
The humans don't really trust him.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.040
We'll have to kill them.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.640
Sergeant Krieger.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.560
- Agent Cross.
- What's our status?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.880
Perimeter's in place.
We're ready to round up the citizens.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.640
Excellent. Agent Singer and l
need transportation to headquarters.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.920
l'll call in the chopper.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.520
Get out of the car
Keep your hands where we can see 'em

38:45.120 --> 38:47.680
l'm Major Carter, United States Air Force.

38:47.800 --> 38:51.280
l have important information
for Agent Cross.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.360
Let her through.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.960
Why are you here? You were
supposed to be detained with the others.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.240
Major Carter's more valuable to you
if she hasn't been exposed.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.840
- That wasn't part of the plan.
- No, she's right.

39:23.960 --> 39:28.000
While we're taking over the NlD,
she can infiltrate Stargate Command.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.880
- lt's too risky.
- You worry too much.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.800
The humans have no idea
what's going on.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.880
Oh, l wouldn't exactly say that.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.120
You guys aren't nearly as smart
as you think you are.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.840
l translated enough of the writing

39:55.920 --> 39:59.920
to know lmmunitech had engineered
the symbiotes with a built-in kill switch,

40:00.040 --> 40:03.040
a susceptibility to a particular antibiotic.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.960
- The syringe. So we had it all along.
- When l saw the Goa'uld coming,

40:07.080 --> 40:11.520
l had nothing to lose, so l injected myself
and it acted like a vaccine.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.120
Took a few minutes to kill the symbiote,
then l just played along.

40:15.760 --> 40:19.920
We had similar results with the
townspeople. They responded positively.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.640
Each dead symbiote will break down
and be absorbed into the host body.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.360
Do the townspeople recall these events?

40:26.440 --> 40:31.200
As far as they know, they were inoculated
against an outbreak of meningitis.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.880
- So what about the ship?
- lt's been transferred to Area 51 .

40:35.960 --> 40:39.040
Even though it's not complete,
it may still prove valuable.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.520
All right. Dismissed.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.760
So when we were in the sheriff's office...

40:48.840 --> 40:52.000
- you were in complete control?
- That's right.

40:53.440 --> 40:57.880
And you felt it absolutely necessary
to really slap me?

40:58.680 --> 41:00.480
l had to make it look good.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.640
Let's get some lunch.

41:09.240 --> 41:13.640
