WEBVTT

00:14.410 --> 00:17.280
Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

00:17.290 --> 00:20.460
Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

00:21.997 --> 00:25.017
It's time for cave-party time,  baby!

00:25.027 --> 00:27.907
Aw yeah!  Let's get
this camp fire going!

00:29.087 --> 00:30.087
Dude,  it's gonna burn.

00:30.087 --> 00:31.407
Dude seriously,  it's gonna burn.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.186
You're gonna burn it.

00:32.186 --> 00:32.857
STOP IT!

00:32.857 --> 00:33.877
You're burning it right now here.

00:34.007 --> 00:34.797
Aw man!

00:34.797 --> 00:36.297
Dude,  I told you.

00:47.417 --> 00:50.677
Dude,  where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

00:50.757 --> 00:52.907
Easy,  I'm gonna be a stuntman.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.307
Dude,  that's so lame.

00:55.417 --> 00:57.127
You're probably still
be working at the park.

00:57.127 --> 00:58.287
STOP TALKING!

00:59.337 --> 01:00.717
Hey,  Mordecai,  have we ever think

01:00.717 --> 01:02.127
we should bring another friend?

01:02.127 --> 01:03.787
You mean,  like a third person?

01:03.787 --> 01:05.917
I guess we keep our
inner circle pretty small.

01:06.277 --> 01:07.077
But it's not like we're ever gonna

01:07.077 --> 01:09.187
find anybody cool enough
for the park,  so...

01:09.187 --> 01:09.947
Yeah.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.147
Good cave party dude.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.817
Rigby... wake up Rigby
Rigby Rigby wake up!

01:31.067 --> 01:32.727
Dude just keep quiet!

01:37.027 --> 01:37.957
STAY BACK!

01:44.447 --> 01:47.737
Whoa dancing caveman!

01:47.967 --> 01:49.387
This guy is awesome!

01:50.717 --> 01:51.897
Dude you are awesome!

01:53.667 --> 01:56.277
Looks it time to go
from Mordecai and Rigby

01:56.277 --> 01:59.397
to Mordecai,  Rigby and Dancing Caveman.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.397
Third friend!

02:02.337 --> 02:06.247
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

02:10.387 --> 02:13.297
Anybody who can shot that
much cheese is cool in my book.

02:20.747 --> 02:21.487
Who is that?

02:21.727 --> 02:22.727
He's a new friend.

02:22.727 --> 02:23.877
Dancing Caveman.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.167
Caveman?

02:25.577 --> 02:27.627
No, no, no way.

02:27.627 --> 02:29.687
I'm not having a caveman at the park.

02:29.687 --> 02:31.107
We are  insured for it.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.967
What?! That's not fair.

02:32.967 --> 02:34.627
Yeah! We can't just get rid of him.

02:34.627 --> 02:36.107
A caveman can not fit into

02:36.107 --> 02:37.767
this modern world.

02:40.737 --> 02:41.387
See?

02:41.387 --> 02:42.777
But it was one of us now.

02:42.777 --> 02:44.777
Really?What's his name?

02:46.027 --> 02:47.077
Get rid of him!

02:47.077 --> 02:48.917
But he will die out there alone.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.397
Come on! Benson!

02:50.397 --> 02:51.977
Please!

02:56.017 --> 02:57.527
Fine.You have a week

02:57.527 --> 02:59.077
to get him civilized.

02:59.077 --> 02:59.867
Nice!

02:59.867 --> 03:00.947
Thanks, Benson.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.337
But if he is not up to
park's standards in a week.

03:03.337 --> 03:04.747
I'm calling a pound!

03:06.487 --> 03:07.477
We are gonna need some help.

04:25.267 --> 04:28.067
That is the most civilized caveman

04:28.067 --> 04:29.517
I have ever seen

04:31.517 --> 04:33.407
Please call me Greg

04:36.987 --> 04:40.457
Good luck with the
benson test! My good man!

04:41.657 --> 04:42.937
Dude that is perfect

04:42.937 --> 04:44.697
Benson will totally let you stay

04:44.697 --> 04:47.027
Yeah! And probably offer you a job

04:47.027 --> 04:48.557
Alright! let's go!

04:48.557 --> 04:49.297
Wait

04:49.297 --> 04:51.817
Me know you worked hard to help

04:51.817 --> 04:54.217
But me not civilized

04:54.217 --> 04:54.677
Ha?

04:54.677 --> 04:56.337
You forgot something

05:01.287 --> 05:02.187
Love?

05:02.187 --> 05:04.187
Me's a meat

05:04.187 --> 05:06.517
that i can't be truly civilized

05:06.517 --> 05:08.977
into me find other half

05:08.977 --> 05:09.977
I don't know

05:09.977 --> 05:11.187
Is there anytime to find

05:11.187 --> 05:12.647
before meeting with Benson?

05:12.647 --> 05:13.377
Certainly

05:14.787 --> 05:16.957
Her name Dian

05:16.957 --> 05:19.127
She frozen with my people

05:20.897 --> 05:22.377
How many were you there?

05:24.137 --> 05:25.007
We were many

05:26.907 --> 05:28.707
Wow!

05:28.707 --> 05:30.097
How'd we find her?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.577
It will be easy

05:31.577 --> 05:33.707
She only cavewoman here

05:33.707 --> 05:36.317
Her beauty shine like star

05:36.317 --> 05:37.977
There she is

05:37.977 --> 05:40.177
My Dian

05:40.177 --> 05:42.957
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Her forehead looks pretty big.

05:47.137 --> 05:48.937
Dian! How i have missed you!

05:49.187 --> 05:50.057
Eh?

05:50.057 --> 05:52.727
My love thousands of years

05:52.727 --> 05:54.727

05:56.337 --> 05:59.107
Mordecai and Rigby give
us an hour to catch up

05:59.107 --> 06:00.327
What do you want to do?

06:01.297 --> 06:03.577
Oh! We can't do that!

06:03.577 --> 06:05.697
It's more civilized times now

06:08.727 --> 06:11.257
Well me may look strange now

06:11.257 --> 06:12.597
but it's a way of time

06:12.597 --> 06:14.477
We have to change.

06:14.477 --> 06:16.537
You will have to change too

06:18.507 --> 06:20.627
It not so bad

06:20.627 --> 06:22.757

06:22.757 --> 06:24.297
Pretty weird ha?

06:24.297 --> 06:26.157
And that's television

06:29.877 --> 06:31.087

06:31.087 --> 06:33.637
Here have some tea, calm you down.

06:37.947 --> 06:40.727
What you mean you don't know me anymore

06:43.527 --> 06:44.457

07:18.907 --> 07:20.747
But youâ€™ll go to the pond if you don't

07:20.747 --> 07:22.497
There only two things that happen there

07:22.497 --> 07:23.447
And you don't want them

07:23.447 --> 07:24.617

08:38.116 --> 08:39.457
I need a new job

08:40.477 --> 08:42.957
Caveman too strong and too many.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.777
You lose your jobs.

08:44.777 --> 08:46.357
Park destroyed.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.247
All my fault!

08:48.247 --> 08:49.877
Come on! Greg! We can do this.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.567
We just need use out brains.

08:51.567 --> 08:52.467
to think up something.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.407
Wait! In my time.

08:54.407 --> 08:56.777
My people value meat above all.

08:57.227 --> 08:58.517
You have meat.

09:03.387 --> 09:05.107
It's working!

09:17.367 --> 09:18.347

09:18.867 --> 09:21.867

09:39.247 --> 09:40.947
I'm sorry.Dian

09:45.317 --> 09:46.747
You alomst did

09:47.127 --> 09:48.597
But you were right

09:48.597 --> 09:50.987
It's wrong to give up self.

09:51.317 --> 09:52.537
Greg!

09:52.537 --> 09:54.467
Dude! Unlock the door!

09:54.467 --> 09:55.557
Get out of there!

09:55.557 --> 09:57.497
Thanks for helping me

09:57.497 --> 10:00.907

Greg thanks for being our friend

10:36.277 --> 10:37.017
Benson? !

10:37.017 --> 10:38.117
I saw everything

10:38.567 --> 10:39.937
I had Greg all wrong

10:40.577 --> 10:43.177
He gave up all for true love

10:43.577 --> 10:46.997
In a way he was more
civilized than all of us

10:46.997 --> 10:49.097
Mordecai Rigby

10:49.767 --> 10:51.017
Clean up this mess

10:51.577 --> 10:54.407
Do it do it or you'll fired.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.177
Greg was pretty cool

10:56.177 --> 10:57.607
Do you think we should
find another new friend?

10:57.607 --> 11:00.577
Two is good enough.
