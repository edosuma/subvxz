WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.550
Heads up, we got a
visitor coming.

00:09.550 --> 00:14.095
Is it a government agent,
coming to take
us away?

00:14.095 --> 00:17.978
Our secrets been out for a year.
Why would they
take us away now?

00:17.978 --> 00:22.063
Let's just say,
I've done some things.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.854
It's my chief scientist
Dr. Ryan.

00:23.854 --> 00:26.737
He is by far
the smartest man
I have ever worked with.

00:26.737 --> 00:29.450
( pointedly clearing throat )
Ahem!

00:29.450 --> 00:32.783
Oh, you are right. I am sorry.
I am the smartest man I have
ever worked with.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.365
( giggles )

00:34.365 --> 00:36.657
Dr. Ryan was head
of his class at MIT.

00:36.657 --> 00:40.371
And he's been
Davenport Industries'
employee of the month twice!

00:40.371 --> 00:41.662
That's never happened.

00:41.662 --> 00:44.755
Well, except,
of course for me.

00:44.755 --> 00:48.929
You named yourself
employee of the month
at your own company?

00:48.929 --> 00:52.473
I think you love
you a little too much.

00:52.473 --> 00:54.135
It's not because
I love myself.

00:54.135 --> 00:56.347
It's because I am
better than everyone else.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.563
Hey, hey! Wassup, dudes?

01:02.563 --> 01:05.186
Lady dude.

01:05.186 --> 01:10.531
This is your
esteemed chief scientist?

01:10.531 --> 01:14.615
And employee of the month!
Got the parking space
and everything.

01:14.615 --> 01:19.580
I don't drive, but my mom
uses it when
she picks me up.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.582
That's right, twenty-eight,

01:21.582 --> 01:27.208
still living rent-free in
my parents' basement.
Jealous?

01:27.208 --> 01:29.340
No.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.843
Dr. Ryan is here
to construct and test
Davenport Industries

01:32.843 --> 01:34.635
new space elevator.

01:34.635 --> 01:35.976
Space elevator?!

01:35.976 --> 01:38.429
You see, this why
people are out of shape.

01:38.429 --> 01:42.683
You should be
building space stairs.

01:42.683 --> 01:44.565
It's a highly advanced transport

01:44.565 --> 01:46.777
that climbs a tether
all the way
to our space stations.

01:46.777 --> 01:51.031
Since it's held up by gravity
we can resupply without
ever using a rocket.

01:51.031 --> 01:53.944
(angrily huffs )
 Chase you look confused
and/or constipated.

01:53.944 --> 01:56.827
Do you have a question?

01:56.827 --> 01:57.908
Yes!

01:57.908 --> 01:59.910
Why is he working on this?

01:59.910 --> 02:03.123
The space elevator
was my project. I've been
working on it for years.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.007
Yes, but I had to pass
it off so you could focus
on being a mentor.

02:07.007 --> 02:10.050
Don't worry, Dr. Ryan's
been working off
your research.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.754
You gave
him my research?!

02:13.754 --> 02:16.217
Yes, and it's
been very helpful.

02:16.217 --> 02:20.891
It's always good
to know what's wrong
so you can find what's right.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.315
Oh, no.

02:24.315 --> 02:26.567
Mr. Davenport,
you can't let him do this!

02:26.567 --> 02:28.229
Check his résumé, Chase.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.030
He is one
of the greatest minds
of our time.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.572
( Dr. Ryan giggles )

02:31.572 --> 02:34.074
I just designed
a photo app that
puts your face

02:34.074 --> 02:37.238
on a dog's butt.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.705
Oh! No argument here,
this guy is a genius.

02:44.705 --> 02:47.668
The world's first bionic
superhumans.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.710
They are stronger than us,

02:49.710 --> 02:51.001
faster,

02:51.001 --> 02:52.793
smarter,

02:52.793 --> 02:55.466
The next generation
of the human race is...

02:55.466 --> 02:58.719
Living on a bionic island.

02:58.719 --> 03:01.722
( theme song playing )

03:34.795 --> 03:37.718
So that'll be the launch pad
for the space elevator.
What do you think?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.930
I'll have
to do some calculations,
but...

03:39.930 --> 03:41.642
sounds legit.

03:41.642 --> 03:43.514
I already
did the calculations,

03:43.514 --> 03:48.849
in my head,
they are totally legit.

03:48.849 --> 03:51.772
Well, then
if you'll excuse me,
I need to get to work.

03:55.025 --> 03:57.237
( plays air guitar )

04:01.532 --> 04:03.864
( continues playing air guitar )

04:03.864 --> 04:05.786
What is he doing?
 Shh.

04:05.786 --> 04:07.418
It's his process.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.372
This isn't fair.

04:11.372 --> 04:14.635
You can't let him
build my elevator
without me!

04:14.635 --> 04:16.377
You know what?
You're right.

04:16.377 --> 04:20.801
Dr. Ryan?
 I'm in the bridge,
I'm in the bridge.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.016
Thank you, thank you.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.309
( clapping )

04:28.309 --> 04:30.060
Proceed.
 Oh...

04:30.060 --> 04:32.653
I want Chase
to join you
on the project.

04:32.653 --> 04:34.815
Thank you.
 As your assistant.

04:34.815 --> 04:37.027
What?!

04:37.027 --> 04:38.819
This guy is a joke.

04:38.819 --> 04:41.492
I bet he doesn't
even know anything
about tensor equations.

04:41.492 --> 04:43.364
Not much, just that...

04:43.364 --> 04:45.616
Tensors are used
to represent correspondences
between sets

04:45.616 --> 04:48.869
of geometric vectors
for applications
in Newtonian physics.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.795
Roughly.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.967
Come on, Chase.
You guys are gonna make
a terrific team.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.839
Don't worry, assistant dude.

04:58.839 --> 05:00.881
I'll make sure
you're very involved
in the process.

05:00.881 --> 05:02.763
I'll even let
you play air drums.

05:02.763 --> 05:04.685
( plays air drums )

05:04.685 --> 05:07.728
Quick, catch my sticks.

05:07.728 --> 05:10.771
( both play air guitar )

05:19.650 --> 05:22.443
As we come to the end
of our first scholastic term

05:22.443 --> 05:24.745
here at the
Honorable Donald Davenport

05:24.745 --> 05:26.617
World Famous Bionic Academy--

05:26.617 --> 05:29.910
Pretty sure that's
not the name.

05:29.910 --> 05:33.624
Pretty sure
you didn't pay for it.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.377
After reviewing
all your performances,

05:36.377 --> 05:40.170
I'm happy
to say that you will all
be moving up a color level.

05:40.170 --> 05:44.094
( applause )

05:44.094 --> 05:47.177
And Leo
will be moving up
two color levels.

05:47.177 --> 05:50.391
Ooh!

05:50.391 --> 05:53.814
Thank you, thank you.
You know, as a young boy,
I never dreamed I'd--

05:53.814 --> 05:55.896
Oh, just put the shirt on.

06:02.573 --> 06:04.785
It's a bit big, don't you think?

06:04.785 --> 06:06.827
Oh, my bad.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.619
Got cold last night
so I wore it to bed.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.751
I must've stretched
it in my sleep.

06:10.751 --> 06:12.202
Why didn't you
get a blanket?

06:12.202 --> 06:14.665
'Cause I wanted
to stretch your shirt.

06:16.997 --> 06:20.801
Guys, I didn't want to say this
in front of the other students,
but not everyone passed.

06:20.801 --> 06:22.633
( sighs )
I've been expecting this.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.176
And I have already written
my letter of resignation.

06:26.176 --> 06:27.968
Not you.

06:27.968 --> 06:30.771
There's still
one student stuck
at the lowest level: yellow.

06:30.771 --> 06:31.972
Who?

06:31.972 --> 06:33.774
Yellow!

06:36.066 --> 06:37.858
Wait, Bob is failing?

06:37.858 --> 06:39.359
But he tried
so hard.

06:39.359 --> 06:41.442
Yeah, but he
is just not tough enough.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.735
I'm worried he doesn't have
the fight it takes
to become a bionic hero.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.697
Wait, watch this.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.789
Guys, we're under attack!

06:48.789 --> 06:51.411
( Bob screams )

06:55.956 --> 06:57.838
( sighs )

06:57.838 --> 07:00.461
Look at this mess.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.803
Don't you know how
to clean up after yourself?

07:02.803 --> 07:06.547
Chase, geniuses can't
be bothered with
little things like

07:06.547 --> 07:08.809
cleaning and, uh...
(sniffs )

07:08.809 --> 07:11.722
personal hygiene.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.766
Really? 'Cause I have
no problem cleaning up
after myself.

07:15.766 --> 07:19.149
And that's what
makes you a good assistant.

07:19.149 --> 07:21.061
I am not your assistant!

07:21.061 --> 07:22.613
I am a genius.

07:22.613 --> 07:25.115
I am!

07:25.115 --> 07:28.869
Right.
Aren't you like
a really smart robot?

07:28.869 --> 07:31.411
Which button do
I push to make
you go away?

07:31.411 --> 07:33.704
I'm not a robot!

07:33.704 --> 07:35.415
But, you are
pushing my buttons.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.628
Oh, okay. You wanna go?

07:37.628 --> 07:40.881
Come on.
I take karate class
every Saturday at the mall!

07:40.881 --> 07:43.213
Oh, yeah?
Karate, huh?

07:43.213 --> 07:45.215
What, does your mommy
drive you to that too?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.087
No! I ride my bike.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.299
Oh, you ride your bike?
With its training wheels?

07:49.299 --> 07:51.892
No! They are
not training wheels, they
are horizontal stabilizers.

07:51.892 --> 07:53.093
Back up.

07:53.093 --> 07:54.725
Guys, break it up!

07:54.725 --> 07:57.057
Big D sent me down here
to help you out.

07:57.057 --> 08:01.692
So you guys need
to both set aside your
differences and work together.

08:01.692 --> 08:03.984
Whatever.
 Fine.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.737
I'll run some algorithms
for the tether gravity test.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.950
And Chase, you can go over
to that support column
and screw in the lug nuts.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.782
Or...

08:11.782 --> 08:14.074
I could use
my bionic intelligence

08:14.074 --> 08:17.417
to work on
the algorithm while
you screw in the lug nuts.

08:17.417 --> 08:18.749
You know, I would,

08:18.749 --> 08:22.422
but Davenport said
you work for me. So...

08:22.422 --> 08:26.296
Lug it up, Robotron.
( whirring )

08:28.759 --> 08:31.802
Okay, Bob, it's our job
as mentors to help you.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.804
So we're gonna toughen you up.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.936
Now you're on a mission.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.808
Hundreds of lives are at stake.

08:37.808 --> 08:42.813
And the only way
to save them is to punch
this pad as hard as you can.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.813
What are you gonna do?

08:43.813 --> 08:46.316
I'm gonna call you guys!

08:46.316 --> 08:49.820
Okay, and what if
we don't answer?

08:49.820 --> 08:53.283
I am gonna leave
a message and wait
for you to call me back.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.746
No, Bob, you need
to punch the pad!

08:55.746 --> 09:00.540
Right.
Punch the pad.
I got this.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.753
Aah!

09:02.753 --> 09:06.086
I don't want
to punch the pad.

09:06.086 --> 09:07.628
Why not?

09:07.628 --> 09:11.011
What did
that pad ever
do to us?

09:11.011 --> 09:13.383
Nothing.
But, if you
want to pass...

09:13.383 --> 09:16.306
you have to hit it.
I mean, you know you
have super strength, right?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.849
Yeah, but I don't wanna
use it for fighting.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.061
I only use it for
really important stuff.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.234
Like opening
peanut butter jars...

09:24.234 --> 09:26.276
and jelly jars...

09:26.276 --> 09:28.779
and pickle jars.

09:28.779 --> 09:30.400
You see where
I'm going with this?

09:32.242 --> 09:34.244
This is hopeless.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.036
Bob's never gonna
move up to green.
 You're right.

09:36.036 --> 09:40.370
We just need
to demote everyone
else back to yellow.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.663
You know, maybe
we need someone else
to teach him.

09:42.663 --> 09:44.625
Someone who
doesn't care
about his feelings.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.008
Someone who can
crush his spirit
and make him snap.

09:48.008 --> 09:50.420
Move it!

09:50.420 --> 09:51.842
Yellow!

09:54.845 --> 09:56.807
T-bone,
Lipstick!

09:56.807 --> 09:58.809
Get on over here and
hold down the dummy.

09:58.809 --> 10:01.101
I gotta work off
my morning meat loaf.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.228
Looks like
we are ready
to launch.

10:08.228 --> 10:10.490
Hold it!
Whoa! Whoa!

10:10.490 --> 10:12.783
I thought I told
you guys not to
start without me.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.285
Oh, Chase,
geniuses can't
be bothered.

10:15.285 --> 10:18.789
I am a genius.
Stop telling me
what geniuses do.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.580
I'm very impressed,
you guys.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.243
Because of you two,
we're about
to make history.

10:23.243 --> 10:26.006
Yes, thanks to
my expert engineering--

10:26.006 --> 10:27.587
And if it
wasn't for Chase,

10:27.587 --> 10:30.751
the lug nuts would
still be in a tin can.

10:30.751 --> 10:34.174
I didn't
do the lug nuts.
Leo did.

10:34.174 --> 10:36.176
And I did them well.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.309
Behold, ladies
and gentlemen,

10:39.309 --> 10:41.391
you are
looking at the
world's first

10:41.391 --> 10:44.975
space elevator,
and my
new haircut.

10:44.975 --> 10:51.271
Which one is
more impressive,
only time will tell.

10:51.271 --> 10:53.273
Don't you think
I should do a
microscopic scan

10:53.273 --> 10:54.865
with my
bionic eye first

10:54.865 --> 10:56.366
just to
make sure?
 Tut! Tut! Tut!

10:56.366 --> 10:58.618
Trust me.
My work
is flawless.

10:58.618 --> 11:01.281
I graduated
college when
I was fourteen.

11:01.281 --> 11:04.835
Oh, yeah?
Well...

11:04.835 --> 11:07.087
I went
to high school

11:07.087 --> 11:09.549
for a year
and a half.

11:12.292 --> 11:14.054
You showed him.
I'm gonna do
this scan anyway.

11:14.054 --> 11:16.056
Of course you are.

11:18.759 --> 11:21.762
( beeping )

11:21.762 --> 11:24.264
( chuckles ) A-ha!

11:24.264 --> 11:26.686
There is a
design flaw in
the braking system.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.308
He won't
be able
to stop.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.900
You serious?
 Yeah.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.232
We have to
tell Dr. Ryan.
 No. Wait.

11:32.232 --> 11:34.114
What if
we don't?

11:34.114 --> 11:37.657
He'll be humiliated
in front of everyone
and Mr. Davenport will--

11:37.657 --> 11:39.489
Send him packing

11:39.489 --> 11:41.782
and reassign
you to head
the project.

11:41.782 --> 11:42.953
That's a
brilliant plan.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.245
Shady,
but brilliant.

11:45.245 --> 11:47.667
Thank you.
Now just
one more thing.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.670
I need you...

11:50.670 --> 11:54.384
to strap in
the test dummy.

11:56.296 --> 11:57.838
Oh, you won't be
needing that.

11:57.838 --> 12:00.971
I will be
taking the inaugural
ride myself.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.302
( screams )

12:02.302 --> 12:03.683
No, you can't.

12:03.683 --> 12:06.937
Yes, I can.
Watch me.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.522
Stop!
You're gonna die!

12:12.522 --> 12:15.445
The capsule's
soundproof.
I can't hear you.

12:15.445 --> 12:17.697
But I read lips.
Say it again.

12:17.697 --> 12:20.160
You're gonna die.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.912
Oh, I guess
I can't read lips.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.533
It looks like
you're saying
I'm gonna die.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.534
( laughs )

12:33.753 --> 12:35.796
Mr. Davenport's life
is in danger.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.257
You have to
abort the launch.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.050
Trying to sabotage
my moment with
straight up lies?

12:40.050 --> 12:43.473
It hurts me to
say this, but you're
out of the air band.

12:43.473 --> 12:45.475
I'll just tell
Mr. Davenport myself.

12:45.475 --> 12:47.938
Give me the comm set.
 No!

12:47.938 --> 12:50.600
( gasps )
You broke my new comm set.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.984
You owe me
$15.99.

12:53.984 --> 12:57.948
Great! Now
we can't communicate
with Big D.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.900
I scanned
your elevator.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.032
There is a
design flaw in
the braking system.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.743
One of your
genius algorithms

13:03.743 --> 13:06.746
must've been off.
 And you
tell me now?

13:06.746 --> 13:09.830
I take it back.
You are not
a good assistant.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.293
Ten...

13:13.293 --> 13:14.624
Nine...

13:14.624 --> 13:16.086
What are
you doing?
 Seven...

13:16.086 --> 13:17.717
Six...
 Sorry.

13:17.717 --> 13:19.299
I always get
caught up
in countdowns.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.550
Four...

13:20.550 --> 13:22.342
Where is
the abort button?

13:22.342 --> 13:24.264
Why would I
make an "I'm going
to fail" button?

13:24.264 --> 13:27.427
Because you
just failed!

13:29.850 --> 13:33.063
( cheering )

13:35.815 --> 13:38.818
So do you think
you can teach Bob
to be more aggressive?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.030
It worked for you two.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.282
Ol' Donnie D may
have created you

13:42.282 --> 13:46.656
but it was my tough love
that turned you into
teenage killing machines.

13:46.656 --> 13:48.328
We don't kill people.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.661
Not without
my orders you don't!

13:51.661 --> 13:54.334
Oh, you two
should leave.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.216
You're not gonna
wanna see this.

13:56.216 --> 13:58.919
Say good-bye
to the Bob you know.

13:58.919 --> 14:00.840
Bye, Bob.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.968
So, I hear you're a softy.

14:07.968 --> 14:12.772
Well, I don't mean
to brag but...
 Quiet, grunt!

14:12.772 --> 14:16.897
Say good-bye
to the Bob you know.

14:16.897 --> 14:21.151
Bye, Bob.

14:21.151 --> 14:24.364
( thundering sounds )

14:24.364 --> 14:27.367
( cluttering )

14:27.367 --> 14:29.329
She does have
a way with children.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.755
Whoa...

14:35.755 --> 14:37.297
I gotta say, people,

14:37.297 --> 14:39.799
from down here,
it looks like my launch
was on point.

14:39.799 --> 14:42.802
Really?

14:42.802 --> 14:44.764
Once the elevator
reaches the end
of the tether

14:44.764 --> 14:46.927
Mr. Davenport
will be floating
in space

14:46.927 --> 14:49.639
with no way back!

14:49.639 --> 14:52.432
I won't say
anything
if you don't.

14:52.432 --> 14:55.225
Guys! The elevator
speed keeps
increasing!

14:55.225 --> 14:57.857
I wonder
if Big D even knows
how fast he's going.

14:57.857 --> 15:00.860
( screaming )

15:07.697 --> 15:09.619
Okay, killer,
let her rip!

15:09.619 --> 15:11.952
( screams )

15:13.413 --> 15:16.206
Wow... Last time I told him
to let her rip,

15:16.206 --> 15:19.459
he did something
completely different.

15:19.459 --> 15:20.750
Very impressive.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.672
How'd you do
that so quickly?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.425
Easy, I just told
him a few
Perry war stories.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.007
Like what?

15:27.007 --> 15:31.051
That's between me and that
scarred-for-life little boy.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.393
I don't get it.
If all you did
was talk to him,

15:33.393 --> 15:36.016
then what was with
all the wall shaking
and awful animal noises?

15:36.016 --> 15:37.687
Oh, that was
before I talked to Bob.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.609
I dropped a dumbbell
on my last good toe.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.561
That was the sound
of me chewing it off.

15:44.824 --> 15:48.698
( Mr. Davenport screams )

15:48.698 --> 15:50.240
I think I know
how to stop it.
What if we--

15:50.240 --> 15:51.992
No!

15:51.992 --> 15:53.623
You don't have to.
 I didn't even
say anything!

15:53.623 --> 15:56.786
I know it's
gonna be wrong.

15:56.786 --> 15:58.458
Hey, wait a minute.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.081
Isn't the elevator
propelled by magnets?

16:01.081 --> 16:02.882
BOTH: Duh!

16:02.882 --> 16:06.716
So if we reverse
the polarity, won't
it send Big D back down?

16:09.509 --> 16:11.471
I know.
 He's right.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.682
What do we do?

16:12.682 --> 16:15.765
I've never
been corrected before!

16:15.765 --> 16:18.728
Oh, and I have?

16:18.728 --> 16:22.602
Congratulations,
you are the dumbest geniuses
I know, now fix this.

16:23.943 --> 16:26.276
Here.
 ( beeping )

16:26.276 --> 16:28.278
This should reverse
the direction
of the magnetic current.

16:31.571 --> 16:32.612
( beeping )

16:32.612 --> 16:33.703
Done.

16:33.703 --> 16:35.665
( Mr. Davenport screams )

16:35.665 --> 16:36.706
Oh.

16:36.706 --> 16:41.081
( screams )

16:41.081 --> 16:42.962
It worked.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.884
It's coming
back down.

16:44.884 --> 16:49.719
[Both]
I did it! I did it!
I did it! I did it!

16:49.719 --> 16:51.841
Guys?

16:51.841 --> 16:56.056
There's still no way to stop it.
And the elevator is coming down
ten times faster.

17:00.690 --> 17:01.771
Both: He did it!

17:05.645 --> 17:07.946
Congratulations on
graduating
to the green level.

17:07.946 --> 17:11.361
Ah, get on with it
and gimme my shirt!

17:11.361 --> 17:13.782
Sorry, they we were
out of green ones,
so I improvised.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.786
Here's a white one
with avocado stains.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.328
Way to go, Bob.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.750
You're the last person
to graduate to the next level.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.794
And I cannot wait
for you to almost fail
again next year.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.217
What he means is...

17:27.217 --> 17:28.468
we're proud of you.

17:28.468 --> 17:30.380
Are you kidding me?!

17:30.380 --> 17:32.762
If you were proud
you'd have gotten
me a real shirt!

17:32.762 --> 17:35.555
( screams )

17:38.768 --> 17:42.232
I think you might
have pushed Bob
a little too far.

17:42.232 --> 17:44.394
Yeah!

17:44.394 --> 17:45.605
He's out of control.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.607
I know!

17:47.607 --> 17:49.028
You've got to fix him.

17:49.028 --> 17:51.451
No way.
You wanna make
him nice again?

17:51.451 --> 17:53.743
You people disgust me!

17:53.743 --> 17:54.744
( spits )

17:56.826 --> 17:58.788
Get out
of my space!

17:58.788 --> 18:00.460
Bob!

18:00.460 --> 18:02.582
You have got
to stop that.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.624
If you keep it up
no one is going to want
to hang out with you.

18:04.624 --> 18:06.416
Good!

18:06.416 --> 18:09.008
But that means
I won't wanna
hang out with you.

18:09.008 --> 18:11.631
That's right
you won't!

18:11.631 --> 18:13.513
Whoa, what?

18:13.513 --> 18:16.636
But you said
you wanted me to be
aggressive and stuff...

18:16.636 --> 18:19.559
my little Bumble Bree.

18:19.559 --> 18:22.682
Yes, only
when you're training
or on a mission.

18:22.682 --> 18:26.856
Oh! Then why did Perry
tell me to be
like that all the time?

18:26.856 --> 18:30.029
Because she's Perry.

18:30.029 --> 18:32.532
She is about
to face the wrath
of new Bob!

18:32.532 --> 18:35.445
( screams )

18:36.536 --> 18:38.788
New Bob versus old Perry.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.740
Now that's a
cage match I gotta see.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.836
Twenty seconds to impact!
What do we do?!

18:46.836 --> 18:49.509
Look away.

18:49.509 --> 18:52.091
Forget it,
I'll save him.

18:52.091 --> 18:54.053
No! Leo, get off
of that thing.

18:54.053 --> 18:55.845
The elevator
will crush you.

18:55.845 --> 18:57.927
My bionic arm is
strong enough
to stop it.

18:57.927 --> 19:01.721
At that speed the
impact will carry all
the way through your body.

19:01.721 --> 19:03.353
My arm also
absorbs energy.

19:03.353 --> 19:05.225
Maybe it'll
withstand
the impact.

19:05.225 --> 19:08.188
It's too risky.
 I hate to say it,
but Chase is right.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.531
It's coming!

19:11.531 --> 19:12.732
We don't have a choice!

19:15.575 --> 19:19.779
( grunting )

19:23.373 --> 19:26.916
( cheering )

19:26.916 --> 19:30.630
I did it. I'm okay.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.343
And it's heavy!

19:38.638 --> 19:40.430
Mr. Davenport?

19:40.430 --> 19:42.141
How did you
get out
of the elevator?

19:42.141 --> 19:44.804
I ejected
using the parachute
I brought with me.

19:44.804 --> 19:46.936
You don't think
I trust my life
to some technology built by

19:46.936 --> 19:49.309
a couple of kids
and an air guitarist, do you?

19:50.690 --> 19:51.901
Hey, Leo.

19:51.901 --> 19:53.943
What the--

19:53.943 --> 19:55.735
You're not even in there?!

20:00.410 --> 20:01.821
( screams )

20:01.821 --> 20:02.872
ALL: Ooh!

20:05.325 --> 20:07.287
It's okay.

20:07.287 --> 20:09.789
If I don't look,
it won't hurt as much.

20:11.421 --> 20:13.713
I looked! I looked!
I looked!

20:13.713 --> 20:16.135
( gasping )

20:23.763 --> 20:25.725
Leo, you're okay!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.897
The doctor said his femur
and tibia bones were

20:27.897 --> 20:30.850
broken so badly he'd
need a titanium rod put in.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.562
Then Big D said
that sounds

20:32.562 --> 20:35.735
expensive and
wheeled me right out
of the hospital.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.857
That's not
what really happened.

20:37.857 --> 20:40.069
I was just worried
he wouldn't be able
to go on missions anymore.

20:40.069 --> 20:42.322
So I did
the procedure myself.

20:42.322 --> 20:45.285
Now he has
a bionic leg.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.417
Wait, so,
thanks to you,

20:47.417 --> 20:50.750
Leo got injured
and now has another
bionic limb?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.293
I'm beginning
to question
your parenting skills.

20:56.796 --> 21:00.720
You two are
my brightest minds.
What happened out there?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.762
We got so caught up in
proving to each other

21:02.762 --> 21:05.725
how smart we are
that we did
something really stupid.

21:05.725 --> 21:08.017
I guess I need
to learn to
work with others.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.520
It just
ain't my "thang."

21:11.811 --> 21:14.814
Yeah.
Neither is proper English.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.818
Hey, Big D,
are you sure this worked?

21:18.818 --> 21:20.610
My leg doesn't
feel any different.

21:20.610 --> 21:23.282
Well, it may take a little while
for the bionics to kick in.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.406
Oh!

21:26.406 --> 21:27.617
Good thing my reflexes--

21:27.617 --> 21:28.998
Whoa!

21:28.998 --> 21:30.670
Ow!

21:30.670 --> 21:32.672
Looks like it worked to me.
