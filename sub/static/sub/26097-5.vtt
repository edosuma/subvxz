WEBVTT

00:09.927 --> 00:12.179
I know this probably isn't
what you wanted to hear,

00:12.262 --> 00:13.514
and I'm sorry,

00:13.931 --> 00:15.474
but many people with his diagnosis

00:15.557 --> 00:17.851
end up living productive,
fulfilling lives.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.438
I don't see why Sam
should be any different.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.155
I mean,
I just think it's a relief, really.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.200
I mean, now we know.
Now we can do things.

00:33.784 --> 00:37.579
You know, like, I was reading that
those noise-cancelling headphones,

00:37.663 --> 00:40.958
they can really help in situations
where he's feeling overwhelmed.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.668
I mean, it's so simple,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.671
but I would never have thought it,
you know? It makes so much sense.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.090
So I'm gonna go to RadioShack,
and pick some up,

00:48.173 --> 00:50.926
and then, there's other things,
there's early interventions.

00:51.009 --> 00:55.180
There's other therapies we can do.
There's a therapy they do with horses.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.100
And it's called Equine Therapy.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.768
-Well...
-Isn't that sweet?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.728
Maybe we can get a second opinion.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.314
-That was a second opinion.
-Maybe we get a third.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.568
Shoot. Do you remember
which of my cousins is married

01:07.651 --> 01:09.278
to the speech therapist?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.405
Is it Andy or Allen?

01:12.114 --> 01:13.657
[Elsa] I'm just gonna call them both.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.867
Kids! Lunchtime!

01:15.951 --> 01:17.035
Hey, Andy?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.162
It's Elsa.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.376
You know exactly which Elsa,
you little stinker!

01:31.049 --> 01:33.051
[Elsa] Yeah, great. Thanks.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.138
Okay, your prescription's ready.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.057
-I'll be back in a jiff.
-You don't have to do that.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.893
Okay, I don't need meds.
It's not that big of a deal.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.896
A panic attack is a big deal.
It's a warning sign.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.733
It's your body saying,
"Hey, mister, slow down."

01:47.816 --> 01:49.818
Panic attack. It wasn't a panic attack.

01:49.901 --> 01:54.239
That's just an overly dramatic way
of saying I got stressed out.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.452
I used to watch my father collapse,
fall on his face once a month.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.537
He's still kicking. He's gonna be 85.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.790
The doctor was very clear.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.209
You need to take it easy.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.296
-Reduce your stress.
-Speaking of reducing my stress,

02:09.379 --> 02:11.882
isn't it time
you should be going back to Luisa's?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.634
[laughs sarcastically]

02:13.759 --> 02:15.886
You can be grumpy with me
all you want,

02:15.969 --> 02:18.639
but I think I should move back in
for a few days.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.182
No. Thank you.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.769
Honey, you're doing too much. The house,
the kids. I looked at your schedule.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.354
You're working three nights this week.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.813
It's fine, I can handle it.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.608
Think of all
that I could take off your plate.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.861
I could go to the store.
I noticed we're low on a few things.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.988
I mean, someone bought the wrong bread.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.573
We're not a sourdough family.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.450
You know, I like sourdough.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.036
Okay? We're fine.
Everything's under control.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.746
I can sleep on the couch.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.206
Please stop.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.541
Please.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.168
Okay.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.381
Okay. I'm just going to make the beds
and I'll go.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.050
Still gonna pick up your meds.

02:59.930 --> 03:00.972
Dad.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.642
You hear all that craziness?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.311
You got to let her come back.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.689
Want me to have
a real heart attack next time?

03:08.772 --> 03:11.358
Dad, I watched you collapse
in the front yard.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.777
You scared me.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.031
Just let her take care of you,
and be her annoying self

03:18.115 --> 03:19.825
just for a while.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.037
Alright, well, just for a few days.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.124
And if it helps,
I'm still going to torture her.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.793
-Promise?
-Yeah, I promise.

03:41.430 --> 03:45.142
[Sam] <i>One of the first rules of nature</i>
<i>is like finds like.</i>

03:45.267 --> 03:46.685
[students chattering]

03:46.810 --> 03:48.478
There you are. I need you.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.023
My mom's loser ex-boyfriend just
moved back in. Where've you been?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.693
Life stuff, dude.
You don't want to know.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.945
[Sam]<i> You would never see</i>
<i>an emperor penguin</i>

03:57.028 --> 03:59.489
<i>and a south polar skua hang out together.</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:01.283
<i>Sure, they're both birds...</i>

04:01.366 --> 04:03.577
Gotta love a guy
who brings only the clothes on his back

04:03.660 --> 04:05.746
and a trash bag
full of drug paraphernalia.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.247
-Jeez.
-Yeah.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.542
[Sam] <i>...but a penguin lays an egg</i>
<i>and tries to protect it,</i>

04:10.625 --> 04:13.712
<i>while the sneaky skua</i>
<i>just wants to make it his dinner.</i>

04:13.795 --> 04:14.921
What's up with you?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.507
Well, we thought
my dad had a heart attack.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.219
Turns out it was just a panic attack
caused by my mom being a tramp.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.222
It's a freaking miracle
the two of us are still alive.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.140
I know.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.351
I knew you two were going to fall in love.

04:29.227 --> 04:33.148
Hey, if you guys ever hook up,
don't forget to include me.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.608
-[Nate] Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.360
[Sam] <i>Polar animals know</i>
<i>that if they want to survive,</i>

04:37.444 --> 04:39.112
<i>they need creatures like them.</i>

04:39.196 --> 04:42.574
But if I woke up one day,
and I was a skua,

04:42.657 --> 04:45.535
I'd probably fly headfirst
into an iceberg.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.454
What is he even talking about?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.084
Sam, I'll confess,
I got a little lost there, myself.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.505
How does that relate to today's topic,
"resources"?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.549
Even if you find a group
of like-minded penguins,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.551
it doesn't guarantee survival.

05:01.635 --> 05:07.140
You still need resources like fish,
or krill, or a nice mating rock.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.143
Oh, well, that actually does relate.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.146
So as I was saying,
the combined unemployment,

05:13.230 --> 05:18.026
or underemployment rate for young adults
with autism is close to 90%.

05:18.109 --> 05:22.614
I know, it's a scary number,
but that is why you're here.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.908
We are going to change those statistics.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.619
Does anyone in here currently have a job?

05:28.870 --> 05:32.415
I work at Techtropolis,
but I do have one strike.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.209
What do you do with your money?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.670
I'm saving mine to buy a defibrillator.

05:36.753 --> 05:41.550
Well, every other Thursday
my manager Bob gives me a check,

05:41.633 --> 05:43.969
and then I take that home,
and I give it to my mom,

05:44.052 --> 05:45.387
and she deposits it.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.765
So you don't have your own bank account?
What a baby.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.852
Amber. Okay, Sam's an adult, he's 18.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.397
Would you like to rephrase your question
in a more respectful manner?

05:55.981 --> 05:56.815
No.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.111
Okay. Well, I'm sure when Sam's ready
to have a bank account, then he will.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.029
But not a defibrillator.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.536
I need a bank account.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.289
Oh, and good day to you, Mr. Rockefeller.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.667
-Because he's rich?
-Yes.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.378
And I'm talking about money?

06:18.461 --> 06:21.590
The more you make me explain it,
the less funny it gets.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.594
Whatever.
I can't learn to manage my own money

06:25.677 --> 06:27.262
if I don't have my own account.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.930
But you already have an account

06:29.014 --> 06:32.434
at the best bank in town:
the Bank of Elsa.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.021
You don't have to wait in line
because I deposit all your checks.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.567
You can avoid all those beeping ATMs
because I always give you cash to spend.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.446
And you get a free hug
with every transaction,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.281
or even without one.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.370
-I'd like to close my account.
-Honey, you want your own bank account.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.956
I get it,
but I don't think it's a good idea.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.960
Handling money, it's a lot
of responsibility and it's stressful.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.255
-It's fine, let him get a bank account.
-Thank you, Mr. Rockefeller.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.215
-Really?
-Yeah, he's more responsible

07:04.299 --> 07:07.719
than most eighteen-year-olds,
more than most of the adults I know.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.972
It's true. I once saw my vice principal
cross the street

07:11.056 --> 07:14.893
when the red flashing hand
was on two. Two!

07:14.976 --> 07:17.604
It'll be good,
I'll take him to the bank tomorrow.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.148
Okeydoke. I'll come with you both.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.276
-No, we got it.
-Yeah, Dad's got it.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.157
-Chocolate?
-Blueberry.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.082
I'm still starving.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.126
Frankie talked me
into ordering the quinoa bowl.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.755
-I feel like I just ate two pounds of air.
-Should have ordered pizza.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.634
Dude, the pizza here tastes
like a stale cracker with ketchup on it.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.055
Wow, I think we finally found something
Newton's a snob about.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.684
I'm spoiled.
Our pizza place, Don's, is the best.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.186
-Then maybe we should go there.
-What now?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.731
-Get a chance to try out Webster.
-No.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.441
-Yeah.
-We shouldn't.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.652
Friday after practice. I'll tell the team.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.698
Well, Friday it gets a little crowded
'cause there's, like, a lot of families.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.409
So maybe like another time, or never?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.577
-No, Friday works.
-Yeah. Friday works.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.538
We're excited to see
where Newton comes from.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.249
-Ooh!
-It'll be fun.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.750
Or sad.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.045
Either way, I'm getting breadsticks.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.840
I once saw a rat there.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.175
No, I didn't.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.055
The lobby's nice.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.182
It's nice and calm.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.436
Yes, you probably won't have
another panic attack here.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.647
Yeah. Probably not.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.774
[bank phone ringing]

08:46.234 --> 08:49.654
You know I'm fine, right?
I just... I got a little stressed.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.533
When I'm stressed, I recite
the four species of Antarctic penguin.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.161
Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor and Gentoo.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.164
-Yeah, I know you do.
-It helps.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.957
Mom taught me when I was little.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.668
You should try it
next time you think you're dying.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.838
Except, if you really are dying,
it won't help at all.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.007
Alright, I will.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.469
Mom helped you come up with that, huh?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.847
Yeah, she put Emperor first,
but I prefer alphabetical order.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.432
Mr. Gardner?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.187
Want me to come with you?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.147
No.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.526
It's quiet in here and it doesn't smell
like anything so I should be fine.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.779
[woman] Right this way.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.452
Okay, Mr. Gardner, you're good to go.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.288
If you have any other questions,

09:40.371 --> 09:41.706
you just give me a call.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.627
I actually do have more questions.
Should I call or can I ask you them now?

09:45.710 --> 09:46.753
Oh, go for it.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.421
[Sam clears throat]

09:49.255 --> 09:52.675
I'm okay with the panda checks,
but could you notify me

09:52.759 --> 09:54.677
if you get any Arctic animal options?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.678
Oh, absolutely.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.723
Did you know it actually costs
1.5 cents to produce a penny?

09:58.807 --> 09:59.849
I did not.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.186
Does it always smell like nothing in here
or is it just sometimes?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.938
-Always.
-Good for you.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.649
Can you adjust the volume
of the ATM machines?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.111
-I'm sorry, we can't.
-That's very disappointing.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.780
I hate touching the pens at the bank.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.575
That's not a question.
Something I thought you should know.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.661
Me too, people are kinda gross.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.622
How many lollipops am I allowed to take?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.542
Go nuts.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.336
This is way better than the Bank of Elsa.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.799
Don't you just love pie charts?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.385
This one shows you the smartest way
to spend your money.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.222
There's a wedge carved out for food,
rent, utilities, entertainment...

10:39.305 --> 10:42.183
-even 10% for charity.
-Propaganda.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.434
What?

10:43.518 --> 10:46.312
You got me a lollipop,
so I'm trying to be nice, but, dude,

10:46.396 --> 10:49.357
I can't believe you were dumb enough
to entrust your hard-earned cabbage

10:49.440 --> 10:51.526
to a corrupt government-backed bank.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.571
FDIC?
More like, "FDI-see you later, money."

10:54.904 --> 10:57.448
It didn't seem corrupt.
They have panda checks.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.075
[Zahid laughs]

10:59.159 --> 11:01.369
Look, I know what goes on in those places.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.454
I've seen <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

11:03.538 --> 11:08.334
You got to get your green off the grid
and invest in<i></i>cryptocurrency, ASAP.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.462
I didn't see that mentioned in the packet.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.591
Of course you didn't.
When the great financial collapse comes,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.010
cryptocurrency will rule the world.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.012
Rule with me, Sam Gardner.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.684
Well, how much cryptocurrency
can I buy for $7,000?

11:25.226 --> 11:27.854
You have $7,000?!

11:28.146 --> 11:30.857
Damn, never mind.
You gotta keep that shit in the bank.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.693
Can I have a loan?

11:34.027 --> 11:34.944
No.

11:35.570 --> 11:39.199
That's probably the right call.
I would 100% buy a peacock.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.120
[pop music plays on radio]

11:45.121 --> 11:48.499
[groans] This isn't comfortable at all.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.085
That's because
your hamstrings are too tight.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.963
How do I stretch out my hamstrings?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.008
By sitting like this, doofus.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.844
[sighs]
Well, since that might take a while...

12:00.970 --> 12:04.015
-[chuckles] Stop.
-[Elsa] Door.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.143
Hey.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.565
-Huh. I missed your mom.
-[mobile phone buzzes]

12:12.649 --> 12:14.359
-Oh, God.
-What?

12:15.485 --> 12:16.361
It's...

12:17.028 --> 12:18.321
Oh, God, just...

12:18.780 --> 12:21.449
Izzie has the whole team excited
to go to Don's this Friday.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.160
They're coming all the way out here?
That's cool.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.705
Not cool. These are people
who go to Aspen every weekend.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.458
Don's is great, but they use sugar packets
to level the tables.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.504
Who's going nuts
with the pizza slice emojis?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.131
Nate. He's Izzie's boyfriend.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.467
Boyfriends are coming? Can I come?

12:40.927 --> 12:44.764
-Yeah. Do you-- Yeah, if you want to.
-Of course I want to come.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.641
These are the people
you're around all day.

12:46.724 --> 12:51.729
Just like I'm sure that you're curious
about the people that I go to school with.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.190
How come you never ask
about people I go to school with?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.191
I do.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.735
I don't. But I will. I...

12:58.319 --> 13:02.031
-If you want to come, you should come.
-Okay. Then I'll come.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.700
Hah, they're gonna love me.

-Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor...
-[Elsa] Gentoo.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.625
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm fine. I...

13:55.835 --> 13:57.295
I can't find my uniform.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.297
I'm late for my night shift,
and I washed it.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.175
-I don't know where the heck it is.
-I'm sorry, it's right here.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.971
I put a little lavender oil in with it,
it was smelling a little ambulance-y.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.725
Okay, thank you.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.145
Oh, and did you see a stack of bills
on the kitchen table?

14:14.228 --> 14:17.231
Saw them, paid them. Bank of Elsa.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.903
Well, thank you.

for my Saturday night party.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.710
The more you give, the better the beer.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.131
Hey, what's up, man?

14:44.092 --> 14:46.552
Hey, I know how you like to party, Sammy.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.846
Want to make a donation?

14:48.930 --> 14:52.558
I don't like to party,
but I do have $700 set aside

14:52.642 --> 14:54.102
for charitable donations.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.104
Is this a worthwhile cause?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.400
Yes! A time-honored Newton High event.

15:01.359 --> 15:05.446
With a contribution of that size,
our class will talk about you for years.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.572
You'll be a legend.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.159
-Well, like Sir Ernest Shackleton?
-Bigger.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.285
Wow! [laughs]

15:11.369 --> 15:15.123
That's impossible. In 1909 he was
the most famous man on the planet.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.213
-Cool egg.
-It's been 33 days.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.090
It could hatch at any moment.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.426
If we're lucky, it'll hatch at the party.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.177
Wouldn't that be awesome?

15:29.137 --> 15:29.971
Yes.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.265
We could all watch it together
in my home theater.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.683
Oh.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.854
That would be better than watching it
on my computer.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.940
-You know, pop-up ads.
-Totally. [chuckles] You know what?

15:41.023 --> 15:44.610
I actually just got
this dope new subwoofer.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.738
It'll be like you're right there
in the egg with him.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.115
Or her, we don't know yet.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.533
[laughs]

15:50.616 --> 15:51.451
Listen...

15:52.535 --> 15:55.580
For $700 we could even do a penguin theme.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.750
Okay... snow cones
and a big ice sculpture,

15:59.834 --> 16:01.586
all-you-can-eat fish sticks.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.630
I do love stick-shaped foods.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.180
All I need is a receipt for my records.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.311
-Hi, how was school?
-Great.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.398
There's an official senior class event
happening on Saturday at Arlo's.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.609
-Class event?
-Yes.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.362
It's penguin-themed,
we'll watch the egg and I'll be attending.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.281
The whole class will be there.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.533
Huh, it's not on the senior calendar.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.536
Why wasn't I sent an email?

16:35.953 --> 16:39.290
God only knows what will be left
on the sign-up sheet.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.792
I'm going to have to call Arlo's mom.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.546
Knowing her, I'm going to be stuck
bringing the cutlery.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.842
I swear, sometimes I feel
like the PTA is punishing me.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.014
Thanks again for doing this for Amber.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.099
-She's loving it, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.520
Mom, look, it's a portable defibrillator.
Isn't it cool?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.647
Wow!

17:04.273 --> 17:06.275
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, come on. I get it.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.278
If you need, like, 500 penguin facts,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.865
-I can help you out, I'm your guy.
-[laughing]

17:14.534 --> 17:17.828
So... how are you? Really?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.456
I'm good.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.250
I'm fine.

Elsa is trying to weasel her way
back into the house. She's...

17:27.171 --> 17:30.591
doing the laundry, and paying bills,
and cleaning the bathroom, and...

17:30.675 --> 17:34.720
-Well, could you send her to my house?
-I could send her to your house.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.182
I don't know
why it bugs me so much, but it...

17:39.141 --> 17:40.309
it bugs me.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.478
[car horn]

17:43.938 --> 17:45.982
Well, for what it's worth...

17:47.316 --> 17:51.862
I used to try to keep my kids away
from my ex as much as possible at first.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.656
He wasn't a monster.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.908
I was just... hurt.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.912
And now, as crazy as it sounds...

18:00.830 --> 18:02.540
I'm sad they're not closer with him.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.917
And that's my fault.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.586
Mostly.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.589
Let's be clear,
he's still a pain in the ass.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.841
[laughs sarcastically] Yeah, I hear you.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.678
Just remember...

18:16.262 --> 18:19.098
you're not going to be this angry forever.

18:19.849 --> 18:23.394
And she's always going to be
Sam and Casey's mom.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.273
Look at all these needles!

18:27.356 --> 18:30.610
Let me see what's going on in here.
Gotta be careful with needles.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.528
Put those back, please.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.793
Hey, I...

18:48.377 --> 18:50.421
I made too much food. You hungry?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.631

18:52.256 --> 18:53.591
The only thing I know how to make.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.970
Um... Yeah, sure. Just give me a sec.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.263
Okay.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.870
''Hey, what's up? How's work?''

19:23.287 --> 19:24.246
''How's work?''

19:34.799 --> 19:35.800
Nice.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.179
Very good.

Hey.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.246
Yeah, this is Evan.

-Hey, everybody.
-Welcome.

-Aren't they the best?
-Yeah.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.439
Especially me.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.943
Hey, you know that
I was her first friend at Clayton?

21:18.444 --> 21:20.905
Oh, really? I thought that Izzie was.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.241
No. No, I was wicked mean to her.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.534
You were so mean to me.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.913
I know. I'm sorry about that,
but I'm so nice now.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.456
Yeah...

21:32.583 --> 21:33.959
Casey's a really cool girl.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.754
Yeah. I know.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.801
So, how's Newton without Newton?

21:42.968 --> 21:46.347
Oh, Newton... I don't know,
I don't go to Newton.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.474
I actually go to the technical school.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.518
But he's really smart.

and told my mom about the party.

Yes, she was worried
about having to bring cutlery.

Yes, exactly.

24:10.532 --> 24:14.370
Other than Don not wanting to split
the bill six ways, that went pretty well.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.163
Oh, I don't think so.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.041
But then again, I'm not very smart, am I?

24:19.124 --> 24:21.251
Oh, shit. Evan, I'm really sorry.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.170
That was such a shitty thing to say.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.090
I just... I was nervous and I...

24:27.049 --> 24:29.927
Hey, but we we made it through,
you're in.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.178
Yay.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.555
-Evan.
-Casey,

24:33.639 --> 24:36.517
you're laughing at jokes
that you don't normally laugh at.

24:36.934 --> 24:40.354
And all your friends at Clayton know
a bunch of personal stuff about you

24:40.437 --> 24:43.482
that even I don't know about,
and then I just watch some rich douche

24:43.565 --> 24:45.943
eat a pepperoni right out of your mouth.

24:46.026 --> 24:46.902
That's just Nate.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.447
Well, I don't know Nate.
And I don't know this "Newton" either.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.951
-What does that mean?
-You're just different around them.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.036
You're someone that's embarrassed of me.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.247
And you're pretending
like you speak Italian,

24:58.330 --> 25:00.332
and you're getting drunk at school.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.252
Okay. Well, I think
that you're overreacting.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.797
They're really cool,
you have to get to know them.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.840
I don't...

25:07.965 --> 25:10.718
[laughing sarcastically]
I don't want to get to know your friends.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.720
They kind of suck.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.184
-Well, then maybe you should just leave.
-Casey.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.146
No, it's fine, seriously.
I can get a ride with someone else.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.150
Okay. Fine, yeah. No, I bet you can.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.359
Bet you can.

It'll probably be a much better car, too.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.495
[car engine starts]

25:52.134 --> 25:52.968
Hey.

25:54.595 --> 25:55.888
Oh, it's you.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.681
Do you live here again?

25:58.474 --> 26:00.142
Well, I...

26:00.601 --> 26:01.477
[Doug] Yeah.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.896
She does.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.858
There's leftovers in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

26:07.941 --> 26:08.817
Okay.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.362
I do? Like, for good?

26:13.572 --> 26:16.784
Yeah, well, it's better with you here.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.998
I know I really messed things up.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.876
But this whole panic attack
has made me realize

26:25.959 --> 26:28.504
that I never made you a priority.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.757
You know?
Like, even when Sam was diagnosed,

26:31.840 --> 26:35.844
I never listened.
I just jumped right in, head first.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.430
And we never dealt
with the difficult stuff,

26:38.514 --> 26:40.265
or the scary stuff together.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.142
But I was thinking...

26:42.684 --> 26:47.272
we could start couples counseling,
really try to fix this.

26:49.024 --> 26:52.402
[stammers] I meant it's better
for the kids if you're here.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.656
It's nice to have you around
in a regular way,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.283
but this doesn't change what happened.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.204
Okay? And this is...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.000
it's too broken.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.713
So, let's just...

27:12.589 --> 27:14.383
think of ourselves as roommates.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.468
Until they graduate.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.845
[Sam] It's hatching!

27:18.637 --> 27:21.515
-It's hatching, it's hatching!
-Oh, yeah?

27:21.598 --> 27:23.600
["I'm Stuck" by Noah Cyrus plays]

27:27.855 --> 27:29.773
[Sam]<i> It's a rough world out there.</i>

27:34.820 --> 27:38.115
<i>Even if a penguin egg survives</i>
<i>the south polar skuas...</i>

27:42.953 --> 27:44.621
<i>and the leopard seals...</i>

27:45.455 --> 27:48.542
<i>and the sea lions,</i>
<i>and the killer whales...</i>

27:50.294 --> 27:54.173
<i>it still only has a small chance</i>
<i>of making it through its first year alive.</i>

27:55.841 --> 27:57.801
<i>Three out of four don't make it.</i>

27:58.343 --> 27:59.803
<i>Three out of four.</i>

28:01.597 --> 28:03.557
<i>Can you imagine what it would be like</i>

28:03.640 --> 28:05.809
<i>if they didn't have their group</i>
<i>to protect them?</i>

28:07.102 --> 28:09.354
<i>I don't want to think about it.</i>

28:10.856 --> 28:12.482
What a great day.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.820
I mean, except for when I lost $700.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.405
-What?
-What?

28:19.156 --> 28:20.032
Best day.
