01:58.134 --> 02:00.753
You gonna say somethin'
or what?

02:00.753 --> 02:03.256
It's your time.

02:07.393 --> 02:10.646
- What's he doin' here?
-

02:10.646 --> 02:13.016
a friend of mine
just walked right by.

02:13.016 --> 02:15.902
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.922
Yeah.

02:35.922 --> 02:40.426
Yeah, baby.

02:49.936 --> 02:54.807
Oh, yeah.

02:54.807 --> 02:57.810
What the hell's goin' on?

02:57.810 --> 02:59.812
Thunderstorms.

03:02.065 --> 03:06.569
- Jackie?
- You smell it? That's rain.

03:09.072 --> 03:11.457
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
you doin' to me?

03:21.217 --> 03:24.220
Go back to sleep.

03:42.238 --> 03:45.241
What are you doin' up?
You got school tomorrow.

03:45.742 --> 03:48.244
Workin' on a high score.
Did your mother
go to bed?

03:48.745 --> 03:51.748
Yeah. Where were you?

03:51.998 --> 03:55.001
Yeah. Compactor went down
at barone sanitation.

03:57.503 --> 04:01.007
Move over.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.012
Ready?
Yeah.

04:06.012 --> 04:09.015
Go. Watch out
for the ghosts.

04:09.015 --> 04:12.018
Whoa!

04:12.018 --> 04:14.520
This thing ain't
steerin' right.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.522
Yeah, kickin' your butt.

04:16.522 --> 04:19.524
So how things goin' with you?

04:21.027 --> 04:24.030
How's school?

04:29.786 --> 04:34.791
Dad, you have
to concentrate. New game.

04:38.795 --> 04:41.297
Hey, no fair.
It's called a handicap.

04:41.664 --> 04:45.168
- Come on. Stop. Stop.
- Kickin' your ass now.

04:45.168 --> 04:47.804
One hand. Look at that.
I can't see. Ha, ha.

04:51.307 --> 04:55.928
Get off! Ow!
Stop! Come on!

04:58.431 --> 05:02.935
You lose.
Focus through distractions.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.939
There's a lesson for ya.
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

05:08.825 --> 05:12.328
Andretti, you listenin' to me?

05:12.328 --> 05:15.832
Good night, dad.
Good night.

05:15.948 --> 05:19.452
Dr. Nathan, please
return to e. R. Bay five.

05:19.452 --> 05:23.956
Where'd you park?
In the parking lot.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.460
No one followed me.
Adriana, you wouldn't
know it if they did.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.964
Oh, yeah, like tony soprano's
hidin' in my backseat.
You are so paranoid.

05:31.964 --> 05:37.470
Bring the car right here.
I know. He's in disguise.

05:37.854 --> 05:42.358
That could be him. Hey, tony!
Or maybe he's in the trash can.

05:42.358 --> 05:45.361
Come out, come out,
wherever you are. Ow!

05:45.361 --> 05:47.864
Let go of me!

05:47.864 --> 05:51.868
It could be anybody anytime.
I don't even know if
it's tony who's after me.

05:51.868 --> 05:54.871
Christopher,
you gave crystal meth
to hisdaughter.

05:55.238 --> 05:58.241
Which i'm not sure he knows.
Look at my wrist.
It's all red.

05:58.241 --> 06:01.127
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

06:01.127 --> 06:05.882
But i got dragged out
to the fuckin' meadowlands
by my neck, mock execution!

06:06.249 --> 06:08.501
What?

06:08.501 --> 06:10.636
What?
Nothin'.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.639
No. What?
You don't want to know,
okay? Trust me.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.142
No. What?

06:16.642 --> 06:20.146
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.
Is that what happened?

06:20.646 --> 06:25.151
Get the car! Please!
Can we just go to brendan's,
score some shit...

06:25.151 --> 06:28.654
and find out what the fuck
is goin' on, please?

06:32.275 --> 06:33.776
The moon. The full moon!

06:34.277 --> 06:36.279
Brendan, let's go.
Wake up, man.

06:36.279 --> 06:38.281
For the exact time.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.785
The fool leaves
his door open.

06:42.785 --> 06:44.787
I gotta pee.
Go for it.

06:44.787 --> 06:46.789
Yo, einstein.
You should have seen me
at the hospital.

06:46.789 --> 06:51.294
It took three nurses
to hold me--

06:51.294 --> 06:54.297
you will understand and comply
with the following orders.

06:54.297 --> 06:57.550
All security personnel are to be
equipped with silver bullets.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.686
Those silver bullets are
to be blessed by a priest,
not in english, but in latin.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.691
All passengers and personnel
are to be restricted
to their cabins...

07:05.691 --> 07:07.693
with the doors
bolted and locked.

07:07.693 --> 07:10.196
End of orders! Sir!
Yes, sir!

07:10.196 --> 07:12.698
Take him below.
Take him below.

07:15.067 --> 07:20.072
Yeah. Yeah. Uh- huh.
That's the message. Thanks.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.575
Way to go, anth!

07:22.575 --> 07:27.079
Here, in five, four,
three, two.

07:27.079 --> 07:30.583
Yo. Yo, check it.

07:41.978 --> 07:44.480
You think this is funny?

07:44.480 --> 07:47.483
What? What's funny?
Yeah, i didn't do nothin'.

07:47.483 --> 07:49.485
You beep me one more time,
you're gonna be sorry.

07:49.485 --> 07:51.988
We don't know what
you're talking about.

07:51.988 --> 07:53.990
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.860
Yeah, maybe she does,
right, anth?
Yeah.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.863
Oh, yeah? Then why'd
you scarf up all the doughnuts
she sent us at camp?

08:00.863 --> 08:05.251
And you used to cry on her
shoulder,"i'm so homesick,
mrs. Piocosta!"

08:05.251 --> 08:08.254
Why don't you shut up?

08:08.504 --> 08:10.506
Have another doughnut,
ya fat fart knocker.

08:15.011 --> 08:18.264
Oh, go on! Kill'im!
Yeah!

08:18.514 --> 08:20.266
Oh, yes!

08:20.266 --> 08:22.768
Dick wad!
Ass!

08:22.885 --> 08:27.273
Hey! Break it up.
Break it up!

08:27.773 --> 08:30.276
I want a five- minute
cooldown period right now.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.402
See ya next week, doc.

08:39.402 --> 08:42.905
Oh, mr. Dante,
you forgot something.
Oh, thank you, baby.

08:42.905 --> 08:46.292
- Don't forget to keep flossing.
- You saved my life.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.795
All right.
All right.
See you next week, all right?

08:52.298 --> 08:55.301
Can i help you, sir?

08:55.301 --> 08:58.304
Sir? Sir?

09:17.323 --> 09:22.828
Oh, my god.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.333
I'm having
second thoughts.
About?

09:27.583 --> 09:30.453
This whole thing,
the whole arrangement.

09:31.454 --> 09:34.457
Security.

09:34.457 --> 09:37.960
I come here. I tell you things.
I don't know how safe it is.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.463
I understand
your concerns.

09:40.596 --> 09:44.600
But i told you what the ground
rules are. As long as i don't
hear anything incriminating--

09:45.101 --> 09:48.604
you don't fuckin' get it.
Just my bein' here
incriminates me.

09:48.604 --> 09:52.608
Somebody sees me, they tell
somebody else. All of a sudden,
i'm a celebrity!

09:52.608 --> 09:56.612
I thought
we made some progress
of your narcissism.

09:57.113 --> 10:00.116
Who are you?

10:00.483 --> 10:03.486
Why is that so important
for you to know?

10:03.619 --> 10:08.124
My mother told me
never to answer a question
with a question.

10:08.374 --> 10:11.877
So, your mother
did teach you something.

10:12.128 --> 10:16.132
If i asked you about your life,
who you talked to,
who you trust--

10:16.499 --> 10:19.001
i'd have to take the fifth.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.506
That's cute.

10:24.006 --> 10:27.009
Oh! I--

10:27.510 --> 10:31.514
i-- i'm sorry.
I wasn't aware of
what i was...saying.

10:32.014 --> 10:34.517
I'm...sorry.

10:42.024 --> 10:44.026
Hey, what are you
doing here?

10:44.026 --> 10:47.029
Chris sent me to pick you up.
Chris? Why?
Did something happen?

10:47.279 --> 10:50.282
Must be my dad, right?
Why else would chris send you?

10:50.282 --> 10:52.785
Did brendan get my poem?

10:52.785 --> 10:55.287
It's probably nothing.
Another search warrant.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.289
He calls them the federal bureau
of annoying bullshit.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.793
You told your old man,
didn't you?
You scared me. What happened?

11:01.293 --> 11:05.798
This is me and adriana movin'
to florida'cause some puke
couldn't keep your mouth shut.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.684
What are you talking about?
Seriously. Did brendan
say anything about me?

11:08.684 --> 11:12.054
Get us outta here!
Get us out!

11:12.555 --> 11:16.058
What did you tell your old man?
About the meth? You insane?
He'd have me beaten up!

11:16.058 --> 11:18.561
Don't you get it?
This is serious!

11:18.944 --> 11:21.447
Let go of me!
Listen--

11:21.564 --> 11:23.566
stop this shit!
He's worried about you.

11:23.566 --> 11:26.819
He's been asking where
you've been, you asshole!

11:26.819 --> 11:30.322
I'm sorry if i hurt ya.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.826
I hate my life,
being a soprano.
Hey.

11:33.826 --> 11:37.329
Don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.331
Fuck you.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.835
Okay, let's go. Remember
like when you were little.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.337
I'll buy you one of those
happy meals, all right?

11:45.838 --> 11:47.840
Where the fuck are you?

12:01.404 --> 12:02.905
This is a new shirt.

12:03.406 --> 12:05.908
Your grandmother
bought you this shirt.
I find it in the trash?

12:06.409 --> 12:08.911
It's a westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

12:09.412 --> 12:11.781
What did you just say?

12:11.781 --> 12:14.784
I got in a fight.
I hope it was worth it.

12:14.784 --> 12:18.287
I hope you did as much
damage to his wardrobe.
Who with?

12:18.287 --> 12:20.289
I didn't get caught.
No demerits.

12:20.289 --> 12:24.293
Anthony, who?
Jeremy.

12:24.677 --> 12:29.682
Jeremy piocosta? You spent
all that time together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.553
Well, if that's all
the information i'm getting,
i'm calling mrs. Piocosta.

12:34.937 --> 12:36.939
No, ma, wait.
Ma, don't call.

12:36.939 --> 12:39.442
I swear. You kids
are going to learn
the value of a dollar.

12:39.942 --> 12:42.445
I'll wash your car.
You never put
any effort in.

12:42.945 --> 12:45.448
I will. I promise.
I'll do it really good.

12:45.448 --> 12:47.450
Just don't call.
I'll get the money.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.953
Forty dollars, anthony.
I know, i know.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.963
Ma!

13:00.963 --> 13:04.467
How ya doin'?
What brings you here?

13:04.967 --> 13:07.970
Remember that pastry place,
ferrara's?

13:07.970 --> 13:10.973
Brought you
some macaroons.

13:10.973 --> 13:14.477
Oh, they're too sweet.

13:14.477 --> 13:17.480
What are you talkin' about?
They're your favorites.

13:22.485 --> 13:23.986
The activities director, rosie,

13:23.986 --> 13:28.491
says they're organizing
a trip to the city.

13:28.991 --> 13:31.494
Dinner and a show.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.996
And you don't wanna go.

13:33.996 --> 13:37.500
I don't like
the people here.
You don't know the people here.

13:37.500 --> 13:42.505
And that city.
Grown men soiling themselves.

13:42.872 --> 13:45.875
- It's not like that anymore, ma.
- That giuliani.

13:46.008 --> 13:47.510
Maybe we should just
stick to the field trip.

13:48.010 --> 13:51.514
Mothers throwin' their babies
out of skyscraper windows.

13:51.514 --> 13:54.633
You're always with
the babies out the windows.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.138
I don't see you tryin' to mix
with the other ladies here...

13:59.388 --> 14:03.275
or talk to the nice gents
i see walkin' around.

14:03.392 --> 14:05.895
You're not makin'
the most of your opportunities.
What do you care?

14:05.895 --> 14:09.398
Out of sight, out of mind.

14:09.398 --> 14:13.402
We don't think like that,
not me or carm or the kids.

14:13.402 --> 14:16.405
I wish the lord
would take me now.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.161
I come here to get cheered up.
You think that's a mistake?

14:22.661 --> 14:25.664
You bein' sarcastic?

14:25.664 --> 14:28.417
You can't put
all your problems on me.

14:28.918 --> 14:31.921
This is the most expensive
retirement community
in new jersey.

14:31.921 --> 14:35.925
If you wanted to, you could be
happy here, but you're just
pissing it all down the drain.

14:36.058 --> 14:38.928
What beautiful language
for your mother.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.321
You want the macaroons?

14:49.321 --> 14:52.324
I don't care.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.702
Leave some out
for the lunatics.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.853
Good- bye, ma.

15:24.607 --> 15:27.610
They're saying
it might rain today.

15:33.616 --> 15:36.118
Don't worry. I'll drive safe.

15:39.121 --> 15:42.124
What the hell are you doing?

15:42.124 --> 15:45.628
This place is an hour
from my office.
An hour?

15:45.628 --> 15:48.130
What are you, a woman?
Get a bladder transplant.
My mother lives here.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.633
It's not real
convenient for me.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.135
It's not convenient?
I'm sorry.

15:53.135 --> 15:58.140
Why don't we meet by your
precinct? The government would
love pictures of us together.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.643
What do you got for me?

16:03.145 --> 16:05.648
Here.

16:05.648 --> 16:09.151
"Jennifer melfi, m. D."
Yeah. Her background,
daily routine.

16:09.151 --> 16:11.654
And your personal
relationship
with her is?

16:12.154 --> 16:14.156
None of your
fuckin' business.

16:14.156 --> 16:16.158
You can't blame a guy
for tryin'.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.661
What are you,
bored with your life?
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:19.161 --> 16:21.163
Bustin' whores and junkies.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.284
Plus, it's a super huge thrill
to pay two alimonies on
a $40, 000- a- year income.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.787
I don't want her touched.
I don't want her bothered.

16:28.787 --> 16:31.290
I just want to know
the who, when, why.
That's it.

16:31.290 --> 16:34.293
Usual fee?

16:34.293 --> 16:39.298
The knicks lost, lieutenant.
You're down two large.

16:39.298 --> 16:42.301
Lay off the vig.
We'll see what kind
of job you do.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.304
Okay. See you in a few days.
What ya got in the box?

16:45.804 --> 16:47.806
Macaroons.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.533
This is awful.

16:58.033 --> 17:00.035
I can't deal with this.

17:02.404 --> 17:05.790
What kind of god? Hmm?

17:05.790 --> 17:10.162
Christopher!
Where you been?

17:10.546 --> 17:13.048
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

17:13.048 --> 17:15.550
Brendan's dead.
What are you talkin' about?

17:16.050 --> 17:18.053
The fish is in my pocket.

17:18.303 --> 17:22.174
Brendan's brains are
floatin' in his bathtub.
Message job through the eye.

17:22.307 --> 17:25.310
- Mo green special.
- Fuckin' uncle junior.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.311
What are you talkin' about,
mo green?

17:27.311 --> 17:30.315
In one, mo green's
eyes got too big
for his stomach,

17:30.315 --> 17:32.317
so they put a small
caliber in his eye.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.937
- Mikey palmice does their hits.
- In his glasses, you mean.

17:35.437 --> 17:36.939
Glasses, eyes.
Why you quibbling with me?

17:37.439 --> 17:39.942
I'm at the world trade center.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.331
What are you doin'?

17:46.331 --> 17:49.701
Mikey palmice is a made guy.
Cocksucker didn't have
the balls to do it himself.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.704
Contracted fuckin' russians
and he killed my friend.

17:52.704 --> 17:56.842
Our response should
suit the message.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.962
Through the mouth
means the guy was a rat.

18:00.212 --> 18:04.216
The eye is just how
francis framed the shot,
for the shock value.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.718
Brendan didn't deserve this.
Don't try to talk me out of it.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.720
You can't touch mikey.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.724
Your fuckin' uncle's
pissin' on your head.
What do you expect me to do?

18:12.724 --> 18:17.729
I'm on it. I know where
mikey's house is
over by route ten.

18:17.729 --> 18:22.234
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.251
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

18:39.251 --> 18:43.255
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

18:54.149 --> 18:56.151
Hey, mr. G. Q.
Hey.

18:56.151 --> 18:58.153
Got a ticket.
Yeah.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.772
How ya doin', mikey?
How ya doin'--

19:07.162 --> 19:08.664
son of a--
look.

19:09.164 --> 19:10.666
Your suit's wrinkled.
Let me fix it.

19:11.166 --> 19:15.287
- Ow!
- What are you screaming about?
Free alterations.

19:15.537 --> 19:18.040
Ow! Ow!
Mr. Slick.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.295
This is overdue.

19:33.188 --> 19:35.190
You hear about
the chinese godfather?

19:35.190 --> 19:37.192
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

19:37.192 --> 19:40.812
You gonna stop this
before it gets out of hand?

19:41.196 --> 19:45.951
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here'cause i love you
and i respect you.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.453
Don't pretend
you're payin' me respect.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.455
A son who throws his mother
in an asylum.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.458
She lives like
apoverettoup there.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.961
That's none
of your business.

19:56.461 --> 20:00.966
Your friends-- they interfere
in my business. They expect me
to turn the cheek.

20:01.216 --> 20:03.218
The truck and all that
was made good to you.

20:03.218 --> 20:07.839
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waitin' for
discipline to be handed down.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.342
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.346
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

20:14.596 --> 20:19.101
Now you're my judge?
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

20:19.234 --> 20:23.605
Oh? Like jackie?
Wanna take this
to his deathbed?

20:25.607 --> 20:30.362
That nephew of yours
we gave a high colonic,
uh, he earns good?

20:32.364 --> 20:35.367
He's comin' up.
Okay.

20:35.617 --> 20:37.753
He works for me now.

20:38.253 --> 20:40.255
Excuse me.

20:40.622 --> 20:43.125
Maybe he gives youagito
for a change.

20:43.125 --> 20:48.513
You got some set of balls.
You know that?
Absolutely not.

20:48.513 --> 20:52.517
I show you my hand,
and you slap it away.

20:56.021 --> 21:02.027
What's the matter with you?
Why can't we talk like
adults anymore, hmm?

21:02.027 --> 21:07.032
Out. Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.537
You don't mean that.

21:34.726 --> 21:39.731
So by the time i get to take
the sergeant exam, of course,
the pay scale is frozen by law.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.733
Why are we following
these people?

21:42.234 --> 21:44.736
They grabbed a meal,
saw a movie, so what?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.356
Lucky for you
they stopped off
at that package store.

21:47.856 --> 21:52.110
- Yeah, i got a juice.
- Yeah, i can smell the potatoes.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.112
Hey, listen, asshole.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.616
Same make and model
left the scene of a triple
homicide on long island.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.118
Stay fuckin' current.

22:04.373 --> 22:07.376
So you broke it off with
the poorshlubafter a week?

22:07.376 --> 22:12.881
I know. I feel for you males.
It's our goddamn fault
you don't know how to act.

22:12.881 --> 22:15.884
Oh, admitting mistakes.

22:15.884 --> 22:20.389
We tell you
to be more sensitive.
You join promise keepers.

22:20.889 --> 22:23.892
We say get in touch
with your feelings.

22:24.393 --> 22:28.897
You run off into the woods
in a loincloth, gunking yourself
with bear fat, beating a drum.

22:29.398 --> 22:31.400
Hey, don't ruin my evening.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.902
You know what i mean.

22:34.403 --> 22:37.406
Sure. You want someone
who's sensitive to your needs...

22:37.406 --> 22:40.909
but still decisive enough
for the occasional grope
in the closet.

22:40.909 --> 22:44.413
Yeah. Something like that.

22:44.913 --> 22:48.917
Oh, shit.
That's all i need.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.304
We were going over
the speed limit?

22:52.304 --> 22:55.307
I wasn't looking.
Pull over.

23:16.695 --> 23:20.699
License and
registration, please.

23:21.199 --> 23:25.704
Uh, i'm sorry, officer.
Did i do something wrong?

23:26.088 --> 23:28.590
Detective.

23:28.590 --> 23:31.593
You crossed a double line.
Have you been drinking, sir?

23:31.710 --> 23:33.712
We had wine with dinner.

23:34.096 --> 23:36.348
Step out of the car, please.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.850
I don't believe this.

23:38.850 --> 23:43.855
Just relax, randall,
and do what he says, okay?

23:45.357 --> 23:49.361
I need you to walk
a straight line to me, sir.
Heel to toe.

23:49.361 --> 23:54.733
Look, uh,
i applaud your vigilance,
but this is totally unnecessary.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.235
All right? I'm a lawyer.
I know i'm under the limit.

23:57.486 --> 23:59.988
Open the trunk, please.
What?

23:59.988 --> 24:01.490
You want to search
my golf bag?

24:01.990 --> 24:03.992
Open it!
I will not.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.244
You ever hear
of probable cause?

24:06.495 --> 24:08.747
Oh, yeah, that's
a real good legalese--
what?

24:09.131 --> 24:11.133
Oh, you resisting arrest?

24:11.133 --> 24:13.635
- Hey!
-

24:13.635 --> 24:16.138
vin, will you fuckin'
cool it? Vin!

24:16.138 --> 24:18.640
He can't do that!
Get back in the car!

24:18.640 --> 24:20.642
He didn't do
anything wrong!
Ma'am!

24:21.143 --> 24:24.146
Back in the car. Now.

24:24.146 --> 24:25.647
Come on. Let's go.

24:25.647 --> 24:29.151
I perceived what
i thought was a weapon.

24:29.151 --> 24:32.654
What the hell's
wrong with you, vin?

24:32.654 --> 24:36.158
Take him. D. U. I. ,
resisting arrest, assaulting
an officer. Do it now.

24:36.158 --> 24:38.660
What's he--
do it!

24:38.660 --> 24:40.162
Jesus.

24:43.165 --> 24:45.667
Don't you touch me!

24:45.667 --> 24:49.671
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be goin' out
for hamburgers.

24:49.671 --> 24:52.674
What? What are you
talking about?

24:52.674 --> 24:57.179
Randall! Randall!
I'll follow you!

24:57.679 --> 25:01.183
I'm gonna call my lawyer, you!
Fuck you!

25:01.299 --> 25:04.302
She's seeing a randall curtin,
tax lawyer.

25:04.302 --> 25:10.308
He's lives at
1242 rennsalaer road.

25:10.308 --> 25:13.311
He's divorced.
He's got two kids.

25:13.311 --> 25:17.816
He's the country club type.
Not much in the balls
department, i might add.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.568
What about her?

25:20.068 --> 25:23.572
Her, the good doctor, she's
in her office at 8:00 a. M.
She leaves at 6:00.

25:23.572 --> 25:25.574
She orders up a tuna sub
and a diet coke.

25:25.574 --> 25:30.078
She's got a three- bedroom condo
in essex fells,
shops at pathmark.

25:30.078 --> 25:33.081
She's divorced.
One kid, 19.

25:33.081 --> 25:37.085
Outside of schmucko,
she don't get out much,
but she does see a shrink.

25:37.586 --> 25:39.588
She what?
Yeah.

25:40.088 --> 25:43.725
She sees a shrink once a week.
His name is elliot kupferburg.

25:44.092 --> 25:46.094
Oh, fuck me.

25:46.094 --> 25:49.598
Well, she don't fuck anyone
from what i can tell.

25:49.598 --> 25:52.100
Well, it's not because
she don't got the goods.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.103
She left her blinds up.
I got some of them
victoria secrettype snaps.

25:55.103 --> 25:59.608
If you're interested.
A little of this?

25:59.608 --> 26:01.610
Good enough then?
Yeah.

26:01.610 --> 26:04.863
- You got any advil?
- What am i, a fuckin'
pharmacy now?

26:05.363 --> 26:09.868
What you got on friday's game?
I got three bills on rutgers.

26:10.368 --> 26:13.872
I don't solve
all your problems.

26:22.264 --> 26:24.266
Thank you.

26:24.633 --> 26:27.135
With a stapler? Wow.

26:27.135 --> 26:29.638
I heard mikey had to
give up that nice suit.

26:30.138 --> 26:33.642
Yeah?
He got too attached to it.

26:33.642 --> 26:38.647
Michael palmice's been
a disease since he was five.
He had it comin'.

26:38.647 --> 26:41.650
It don't make things
any easier though.
My uncle's a stubborn man.

26:41.783 --> 26:44.786
Stubborn enough to go to war?

26:47.539 --> 26:51.042
What kind of word is that?

26:51.042 --> 26:56.548
There hasn't been a war
since the columbo thing.
Everybody decided.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.050
No one's goin' to
the mattresses this day and age.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.554
I got a top- of- the- line
posturpedic at my house.
Fuck it.

27:02.554 --> 27:06.558
If jackie hadn't
gotten sick, none of this
would have happened.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.060
When you're right,
you're right.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.564
One of us captains gotta
step up. Lack of control at the
top is fuckin' up this family.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.567
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

27:15.567 --> 27:20.071
If the old man were here,
instead of in that cell
in springfield,

27:20.071 --> 27:23.074
he'd say,"raymond,
this is your moment."

27:23.074 --> 27:26.077
Go easy with
the grease gun, okay?
What?

27:26.578 --> 27:30.582
You're the boy wonder.
Both him and jackie
had you picked from day one.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.084
You got the age.
You got the seniority.

27:33.084 --> 27:37.088
I also got an 18- year- old
with m. S. , okay?

27:37.088 --> 27:39.591
I told nucci
i'd be doin' less, not more.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.594
All due respect to your
crippled kid, you don't
want a wire up your ass.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.596
You don't want the headache.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.599
That's why you should be boss.
You're so fuckin' smart.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.101
And it's
"physically challenged."

27:50.101 --> 27:52.604
Absolutely.

27:53.104 --> 27:56.107
Why don't we run this thing
like a council?

27:56.608 --> 28:00.612
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

28:00.612 --> 28:06.117
We need a supreme commander
at the top, not the fuckin'
dave clark five.

28:06.117 --> 28:09.621
Face it. You and junior
are gonna have to duke it out.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.625
You gotta be boss.
Number one:
I love the man.

28:14.125 --> 28:18.129
Number two:
He's got new york behind him.

28:18.129 --> 28:22.133
Not for anything,
god bless your uncle, but he's
livin' in the wrong century,

28:22.133 --> 28:24.135
and new york knows it.

28:24.135 --> 28:28.139
You want it, t?
You'll get their okay.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.643
It's the right thing.
It's inevitable.

28:31.643 --> 28:35.146
I don't want no disturbance.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.163
Hey, what's up?
Nothin'.

28:52.414 --> 28:55.417
I bet you told your mom
what happened.

28:55.784 --> 28:58.286
What are you, high?

28:58.286 --> 29:02.290
Well, you owe me 40 bucks
for the shirt. The collar
was totally ripped.

29:02.424 --> 29:04.426
You still owe me
for fourth of july.

29:04.426 --> 29:06.177
Bottle rockets?
I paid for them.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.181
Not for the m80s.
Remember? The ones
you blew up the frogs with.

29:10.181 --> 29:14.185
- Oh, yeah.
That was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

29:14.686 --> 29:17.689
Listen. Just give me the money.

29:17.806 --> 29:21.192
- That thing was so gay.
I did you a favor.
- You're gonna do it.

29:21.309 --> 29:23.311
Make me, fatty.

29:24.446 --> 29:26.314
- Dick wad.
- Asshole.

29:26.815 --> 29:29.818
Whoa!

29:30.318 --> 29:32.821
Shithead.

29:32.821 --> 29:35.323
Bitch-- come on.

29:36.574 --> 29:39.077
Let's go, shithead.

29:39.077 --> 29:42.080
- Let me go!
- Why? So i can
kick your ass again?

29:42.213 --> 29:45.216
- I was kicking your ass.
- Nobody won. It was a draw.

29:45.216 --> 29:49.721
The pit tomorrow, 3:00.

29:49.838 --> 29:53.341
You gotta help me
with these cinch bugs.
They're killing my sweet corn.

29:53.341 --> 29:56.845
Well, this blue stuff works
pretty well, and it's safe
for the environment.

29:56.845 --> 30:00.348
I tried that.
You got any d. D. T. Back there?

30:00.732 --> 30:03.735
Uh, that stuff's illegal.
It's been banned.

30:04.102 --> 30:07.105
Maybe you got a surplus in the
back, you could go, you look.
I'll meet you back there.

30:07.355 --> 30:09.858
Look, mr. Soprano,
if i could do
something, i would--

30:10.241 --> 30:14.496
mr. Piocosta! Right?
How ya doin'?

30:16.364 --> 30:19.367
Remember our boys went
to camp aheka together?

30:19.501 --> 30:22.003
Of course. Tony.
How are ya?
Good. Good.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.873
Your kid still got
that killer crossover dribble?

30:24.873 --> 30:28.376
- Yeah, i guess so.
- That's gonna get him
a scholarship.

30:28.376 --> 30:31.012
- So how's anthony?
- He's moody, you know?

30:31.513 --> 30:34.516
For a kid that age,
you know?

30:34.632 --> 30:36.634
It was nice seein' ya, tony.

30:36.885 --> 30:40.271
Why don't we get together and
cook up some dogs for the boys?

30:40.271 --> 30:44.776
Tony, i-- i don't even know
if these guys are close anymore.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.278
Did anthony mention
anything to you?

30:47.529 --> 30:49.531
I'll have carmela call joanie.
We'll get together.

30:50.031 --> 30:52.650
- Linda.
- Linda.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.286
That's great.
Tony, that's great.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.289
I'll see you around.

31:32.323 --> 31:34.325
Tony?

31:34.325 --> 31:37.328
Yeah.
Oh, my god.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.330
Tony?

31:42.834 --> 31:47.839
I thought the medication
was supposed to help
your panic attacks.

31:47.839 --> 31:52.844
It-- it does.
It's the first one in a while.

31:52.844 --> 31:57.348
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.851
He's got more degrees
than a thermometer.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.354
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

32:05.356 --> 32:08.359
Does your therapist
ask questions
about our marriage?

32:08.359 --> 32:11.362
I know that personal
feelings are hard for you
to talk about.

32:11.863 --> 32:15.867
Talk. That's
all we do is talk.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.369
Carm, i'm gonna quit.

32:18.369 --> 32:22.874
Did you bring
this up with him?
Yeah.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.377
He knows. I guess.

32:28.379 --> 32:32.383
Oh, shit. I forgot to take
my fuckin' prozac this mornin'.

32:32.884 --> 32:35.386
It's up in the bathroom.
Can you get it?

32:37.388 --> 32:41.893
I know with jackie sick
you're under
tremendous pressure.

32:42.393 --> 32:46.397
But i feel if
the therapy didn't hurt,
it wouldn't be helping.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.901
No, you don't understand.

32:49.901 --> 32:53.905
That's why you're
in therapy. Because
i don't understand!

32:53.905 --> 32:57.909
I'm telling you, tony,
if you give up now, i'm gonna
have to reevaluate things.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.411
What is that, huh?

33:00.411 --> 33:03.414
I got a very sensitive job.
I'm not an average joe
on the block.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.417
I gotta spell it out for you?
It's our marriage, tony!

33:06.417 --> 33:08.419
Therapy is
too much exposure.
Fine!

33:08.419 --> 33:11.923
You live with
the results then!

33:11.923 --> 33:14.425
What's that, a threat?

33:14.792 --> 33:17.295
No, tony.
It's a rave review.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.797
You get your own
fuckin' pills.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.021
How long did the attack last?

33:27.522 --> 33:29.023
About 30 seconds.

33:31.025 --> 33:35.396
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it though.
I never lost consciousness.

33:35.897 --> 33:38.900
Anything since?

33:39.400 --> 33:43.905
I'm gonna write
a script for xanax,
just for a couple of days.

33:43.905 --> 33:49.043
It'll get you over
this short- term stresses.

33:49.043 --> 33:54.549
My uncle. He's got me in a box
where i gotta do something
i don't wanna do.

33:59.554 --> 34:01.556
And then there's my mother.

34:01.556 --> 34:04.058
I pay four grand a month
for this place,

34:04.559 --> 34:09.063
and she acts like i'm an eskimo,
pushing her out to sea.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.815
She's testing.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.770
Same as your uncle.

34:16.154 --> 34:19.157
Like little kids.

34:19.273 --> 34:22.275
There's a good book about this.
I'll give you the name.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.411
No, i read, i go right out.

34:24.911 --> 34:28.666
It'sstrategies for
coping with elder family.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.536
Can't fuckin' spank'em though.

34:33.036 --> 34:37.041
Would it hurt you
to let your mother think
that she's still in charge?

34:37.041 --> 34:40.043
You have children.
You know what they're like.

34:40.043 --> 34:45.800
You know that sometimes it's
important to let them have the
illusion of being in control.

34:56.944 --> 34:58.946
Chris, my man!

34:59.447 --> 35:01.949
Surprised to see me?
Heard they took you
for a little ride.

35:01.949 --> 35:05.453
Tour of the meadowlands.
Oh, yeah?

35:05.953 --> 35:07.955
Heard you had
a little b. M. Out there.

35:07.955 --> 35:10.458
- So you got my cut?
- They came and took it.

35:10.458 --> 35:13.461
- Who?
- Junior soprano's boys.

35:13.461 --> 35:15.463
They said you was out,
and it's they corner now.

35:15.463 --> 35:19.467
- You let them do that?
- I don't argue too well
suckin' on a smith & wesson.

35:19.467 --> 35:23.471
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street,
you out of commission.

35:23.971 --> 35:25.973
Sorry, man. Business.

35:27.975 --> 35:31.979
Chris, you know there's
no one i'd rather give
my ten points to than you.

35:32.230 --> 35:36.234
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.236
Oh, i'm glad
that you say that, man.

35:38.736 --> 35:42.607
Sneaky motherfucker!

35:42.857 --> 35:45.993
Oh, shit! Oh!

35:45.993 --> 35:51.249
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

35:51.249 --> 35:55.753
This is my corner.
You pay anyone but me,
i'm comin' back for your thumbs.

35:56.003 --> 35:59.006
And that didn't happen,
what you said!

36:04.262 --> 36:06.264
I'm gonna kill you!

36:14.021 --> 36:16.524
If you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

36:16.524 --> 36:20.027
Sweep kick and steamroll.
Game is over.

36:20.027 --> 36:22.029
All you're doing
is makin' me nervous.

36:22.530 --> 36:26.033
Do you want a nitro bar?
Would you shut the fuck up?

36:26.400 --> 36:30.905
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

37:02.436 --> 37:04.438
Here.

37:04.438 --> 37:08.075
- What the hell is that?
- Just take it.

37:08.576 --> 37:10.578
I'll fight you for it.

37:11.078 --> 37:13.831
- I can't.
- What do you mean, can't?

37:14.198 --> 37:17.201
Just take it!

37:20.705 --> 37:23.090
I knew you'd chicken out.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.712
Man!

37:28.095 --> 37:29.597
He chickened out.
He's scared.

37:30.097 --> 37:32.099
Oh, yeah!
He's real scared ofyou.

37:32.099 --> 37:36.604
What's that supposed to mean?
You won, man! Yeah!
Tonio, you won!

37:37.104 --> 37:39.857
I'm leaving.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.978
Boo!

38:18.145 --> 38:20.147
One of the gangland's
youngest alleged leaders...

38:20.514 --> 38:23.401
died late this afternoon
at st. Isaac's hospital.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.903
Turn it off.
Turn the music off!
Giacomo "jackie" aprile,

38:25.903 --> 38:30.408
allegedly one of the state's
top mafia figures was first
hospitalized last year.

38:30.908 --> 38:36.414
Authorities called aprile
the acting boss for 74- year- old
ercoli "eckley" demeo,

38:36.414 --> 38:39.784
currently serving
a life sentence in springfield
federal penitentiary.

38:40.284 --> 38:45.289
Authorities believe he was made
acting boss for the north jersey
mafia two years ago.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.425
Aprile was 44 years old.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.928
Thank you, heather,
for that live report.

38:50.928 --> 38:54.932
Goddamn it. I was just there.
They told me
he wouldn't go today.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.934
It looks like the possibility
of rain for this weekend.

38:57.435 --> 39:01.439
I'll never forget
where i was this day.

39:04.692 --> 39:08.195
It's okay.

39:08.195 --> 39:11.699
He was a good man.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.202
Let's do a toast.
Give me a toast.

39:17.705 --> 39:20.708
To a great man.
To a great leader.

39:20.708 --> 39:23.711
A great friend.

39:25.713 --> 39:27.715
To jackie.

39:28.716 --> 39:32.219
Buonanima.
Buonanima.

39:36.223 --> 39:39.727
T! Ya hear what happened?

39:40.094 --> 39:41.595
Just now.

39:41.595 --> 39:46.100
That's not all. I go to make
a pickup from yo yo mendez.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.103
He says it ain't my corner
anymore. It's junior's.

39:49.103 --> 39:52.106
Christopher.
This ain't the time.
They're movin' in!

39:52.606 --> 39:55.609
I say we go to defcon 4!

39:55.609 --> 39:58.612
I gotta assess this, all right?

39:59.113 --> 40:03.117
What are we, politicians?
Does this look like
the senate to you?

40:03.117 --> 40:05.119
- Hey, hey.
- This is about respect
of our thing!

40:05.119 --> 40:07.621
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
It doesn't concern you!

40:07.621 --> 40:12.126
Yes, it is. I represent you
out there, and i'm tired of
puttin' my tail between my legs.

40:12.126 --> 40:16.130
This ain't negotiation time.
This isscarface, final scene.

40:16.630 --> 40:19.633
Fuckin' bazookas under each arm.
Say hello to my little friend.

40:20.134 --> 40:22.770
Always with the scenarios.

40:23.270 --> 40:25.773
You don't do somethin', i gotta
question your leadership.

40:26.273 --> 40:28.776
What the--
you ungrateful little fuck!

40:28.776 --> 40:31.278
Where'd you get
the balls to question
my leadership, huh?

40:31.779 --> 40:33.280
I'm just sayin' how it is.

40:33.781 --> 40:36.784
I ought to rip
your fuckin' head off
and finish the job.

40:37.284 --> 40:39.787
You're the boss.
That's right.
I am.

40:39.787 --> 40:45.292
You're lucky a man
i loved died today.

40:54.802 --> 40:58.806
Here we go,
the war of'99.
We should go with him.

40:58.806 --> 41:01.809
You do what you're told
when you're told.

41:03.811 --> 41:04.812
Adios, junior.

41:07.314 --> 41:10.317
Mind your mother now,
hear me?

41:13.821 --> 41:16.824
Never mind.

41:17.324 --> 41:19.827
A little more.
That's good right there.

41:19.827 --> 41:22.329
Right there?
Yeah, that's good.

41:22.329 --> 41:24.331
All right.

41:29.336 --> 41:31.705
Here! Take this.

41:33.207 --> 41:35.209
Uncle junior.

41:35.342 --> 41:37.344
I need to talk to ya.

41:41.098 --> 41:46.604
I came in heavy, like you said,
but i don't wanna use it.

42:01.869 --> 42:05.873
Our friend jackie has died.

42:06.874 --> 42:08.876
I heard.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.128
Now we need a leader.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.882
We do.

42:18.886 --> 42:21.388
And i don't want any
confusion or misunderstandin'.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.257
Yes?

42:25.259 --> 42:29.763
Sopranos have been waiting
a long time to take the reins.

42:34.268 --> 42:37.271
That's why i want it
to be you, uncle jun.

42:42.776 --> 42:44.778
This is your decision?

42:44.778 --> 42:47.031
It is.

42:47.531 --> 42:49.533
You speak for the captains?

42:49.667 --> 42:51.669
I can.

42:53.671 --> 42:56.173
Come here.

42:56.173 --> 43:00.678
You crazycialtrone.
You had me worried there.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.180
You think i'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?
You been pumpin' iron?

43:03.180 --> 43:05.683
You're stronger than a bull.

43:05.683 --> 43:10.054
Hey, call parcel's.
Give this guy a tryout, huh?
Come here.

43:10.554 --> 43:14.058
Always the bullshitter.
Just one thing, one thing.

43:14.058 --> 43:18.562
You know i can't
be perceived to
lose face, right?

43:18.562 --> 43:22.566
So, bloomfield...

43:25.069 --> 43:27.071
and the paving union.

43:27.071 --> 43:29.573
It's my asking price.

43:34.578 --> 43:38.082
Congratulations.

43:46.924 --> 43:49.426
I almost got
in a fight today.

43:49.426 --> 43:52.930
Fight?
With jeremy piocosta.

43:52.930 --> 43:55.432
I take french with his brother.
He's such a poseur.

43:55.683 --> 43:59.186
Who won?
No one. He backed out.

43:59.687 --> 44:02.189
Phil litto said,
"yeah, he's real scared of you."

44:02.189 --> 44:04.191
When i asked
what that meant,
they all laughed.

44:04.191 --> 44:07.194
Duh.
What do you mean?

44:07.194 --> 44:10.698
Sometimes you're so naive.

44:10.698 --> 44:14.201
What do you think
dad does for a living?
Waste management.

44:14.201 --> 44:17.204
Do you know any other
garbage men who live
in a house like this?

44:17.204 --> 44:18.706
Uncle jackie.

44:18.706 --> 44:21.709
And why do we call him uncle
when he's not even related?

44:23.210 --> 44:25.713
He's in dad'sotherfamily.

44:28.215 --> 44:30.601
Come here.

44:40.861 --> 44:42.363
I'll print it out for you.

45:24.655 --> 45:27.908
Hi.
Jennifer.

45:28.409 --> 45:31.912
I tried calling.
Yeah, the phone's
off the hook.

45:31.912 --> 45:33.914
Come on in.

45:38.919 --> 45:42.790
I guess we won't
be going to dinner.

45:42.790 --> 45:44.792
I'm worried, jennifer.

45:48.295 --> 45:50.798
I think i'm starting
to lose it.

45:50.798 --> 45:54.051
I was standing
in line this morning
in the doughnut shop.

45:54.051 --> 45:59.556
A man in a booth looked at me.
All of a sudden, i started
shaking uncontrollably.

45:59.556 --> 46:02.059
Lady says,"next."
I ran away.

46:04.945 --> 46:10.951
Hey. You've been through
a very traumatic experience.

46:12.953 --> 46:18.959
I hate to admit this, but
i'm afraid to go outside.

46:19.960 --> 46:25.966
I...got this crazy idea
that i'm being followed.

46:25.966 --> 46:29.970
And this song keeps
running through my head.

46:29.970 --> 46:32.973
"People are strange."
The doors.

46:33.474 --> 46:37.978
Where faces look evil
when you're alienated.

46:37.978 --> 46:39.980
Randall--

46:39.980 --> 46:44.485
dead at 27
in a paris bathtub.

46:44.485 --> 46:47.488
Okay, i think you should go
and talk to mel gelbar.

46:47.488 --> 46:50.991
He specializes in
post- traumatic stress disorder.

46:50.991 --> 46:53.994
Y- you couldn't
prescribe something?

46:54.495 --> 46:56.497
I'm your date,
not your doctor.

46:56.997 --> 47:00.501
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah. No.

47:31.398 --> 47:37.037
Saw my first dead body
when i was about 15, maybe 16.

47:37.037 --> 47:41.041
Won't tell you about how he got
clipped, because it was, uh--

47:43.544 --> 47:45.546
sorry.

47:45.796 --> 47:49.917
You okay?
I was thinking.

47:49.917 --> 47:54.171
I guess i live
a sheltered existence.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.673
How so?

47:58.675 --> 48:01.678
Well, i'm in this room
for ten hours a day.

48:01.678 --> 48:04.681
I guess i'm out of touch
with the...

48:04.681 --> 48:09.686
climate of rage
in american society,

48:09.686 --> 48:12.689
the casual violence.

48:12.823 --> 48:16.443
Your voice is all tight.

48:20.447 --> 48:24.952
This week my friend
got beat up...

48:24.952 --> 48:27.337
by a policeman, no less.

48:28.839 --> 48:30.340
Oh, yeah?

48:30.841 --> 48:34.845
It was a nightmare.

48:34.845 --> 48:37.214
Wow.

48:37.214 --> 48:39.716
I mean, i don't know
if this cop...

48:39.716 --> 48:43.220
was crazy or drunk or what.

48:43.220 --> 48:49.226
But he was raving,
"prime rib, hamburger."
It was surreal.

48:49.610 --> 48:53.113
Fuckin' moron.

48:54.615 --> 48:58.735
I mean, it sounds like
this guy is a fuckin' moron.

48:58.735 --> 49:02.623
My friend's filing suit
against the city.

49:02.623 --> 49:06.627
But the worst part of it is,
my relationship with him
will never be the same.

49:06.743 --> 49:11.381
Sorry.
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

49:11.882 --> 49:17.387
Hey, this is your session.
I'm sorry. This is--

49:17.504 --> 49:19.506
hey.
Very unprofessional.

49:19.506 --> 49:22.509
No, it's all right.
You had your wits
scared out of you.

49:23.010 --> 49:25.512
Is the xanax helping?

49:25.762 --> 49:30.267
Fine. No more attacks.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.904
But you still
have your doubts?

49:33.904 --> 49:37.407
About therapy?

49:37.407 --> 49:40.410
No, no, no, no.
Give it another chance.

49:40.911 --> 49:43.914
Got a lot of good ideas here.

49:43.914 --> 49:45.916
Okay.

49:46.166 --> 49:49.670
On how to cope.

49:52.422 --> 49:57.427
Tell me why this was
a smart move to make
junior the big willie.

49:57.427 --> 50:01.932
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

50:03.934 --> 50:06.937
Truth is, every decision
is made by me.

50:06.937 --> 50:08.939
I still worry
about the money end.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.441
That's'cause that's
what you do. You worry.

50:11.441 --> 50:15.445
He doesn't know
we kick back to jackie.

50:15.445 --> 50:16.947
We're gonna do good.

50:17.447 --> 50:21.952
Point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fuckin' camper.

50:21.952 --> 50:24.454
The house is secure.

50:24.454 --> 50:28.458
Yeah, only now we got
a brand- new lightning rod
on top to take the hits.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.460
Smart. Very smart.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.964
Yeah, and now
you got bloomfield
and the union chair.

50:34.464 --> 50:38.969
Otherwise you'd fuck me, larry,
but you wouldn't respect me
in the morning, would ya?

50:38.969 --> 50:41.471
As long as you guarantee
to keep the old fart in line.

50:41.471 --> 50:44.975
Hey, i still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

50:44.975 --> 50:47.978
Look at him
over there with my ma.

50:47.978 --> 50:50.480
Those people went
through world war ii.

51:11.618 --> 51:13.870
Thank you.

51:18.875 --> 51:22.879
