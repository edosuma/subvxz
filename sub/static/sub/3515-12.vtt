eat at Ampersand?

a better experience than

02:09.720 --> 02:10.767

No, he pretended like something
was really wrong with me,

02:21.720 --> 02:25.406

like I was having a hot flash.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.768

ALICE: Oh, I can't wait!
I'm so excited!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.682
And if you need us to do
anything, you just let us know.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.969
BART: Congratulations, son. I'm
sure she's a very nice lady.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.041
How old is she?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.724
Wow. Okay,
I got to go, Dad.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.841
Love you.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.443
Oh, thank God that's over.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.891
RENARD: Oregon highway State
Patrol Officer Aguilar

13:53.960 --> 13:55.405
was in high-speed pursuit
on the highway

13:55.520 --> 13:58.205
before the suspect turned
off on a frontage road.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.487
Officer Aguilar then caught
up to the suspect's vehicle

14:00.560 --> 14:02.927
approximately two minutes later.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.120
(PUNCHES THUDDING)
(GRUNTING)

14:28.440 --> 14:29.441
(SCREAMING)

14:29.520 --> 14:30.646
(VIDEO PAUSES)

14:32.440 --> 14:35.330
We received an update about 20
minutes ago from the State Police.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.767
They've linked this attack
to two other scalpings,

14:37.840 --> 14:41.287
one in San Diego of
a border patrol officer,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.767
the other attack in San
Rafael on a naval captain.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.888
We believe the suspect
entered illegally from Mexico

14:45.960 --> 14:47.928
and is now headed our way.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.810
So it seems that
we have a serial killer

14:49.880 --> 14:51.484
who's targeting men in uniform.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.120
No motive for the scalpings yet,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.242
other than he's
taking souvenirs.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.890
Now based on the pursuit video,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.571
we know the car to be
a 2011 Dodge Challenger.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.723
No plates, no registration,
but it does stand out.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.928
So look for it
but do not, I repeat,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.561
do not engage the suspect
without proper support.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.244
You got that?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.481
All right.
Let's be careful.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.081
Adalind.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.527
Sebastien?

15:30.840 --> 15:31.921
It's good you're early.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.047
Why?

15:33.760 --> 15:34.921
He's with Danilov.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.849
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.645
You should.

15:39.720 --> 15:40.846
He's head of the Verrat.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.250
Be careful what you say.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.525
Why are you telling me this?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.050
We all need to be prudent now.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.605
Based on what I'm seeing,

15:58.680 --> 16:01.889
I doubt your man Breslau held
very much back. (EXHALES)

16:02.520 --> 16:03.806
Neither did they.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.769
Do we know who did this to him?

16:06.280 --> 16:08.567
We know these three men
were involved.

16:09.920 --> 16:14.209
Meisner, Frenay, and Tavitian.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.203
They met somewhere
outside Bratislava,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.203
which is where we believe
they killed Breslau.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.764
The Resistance is solidifying.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.241
That's distressing.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.651
And probably the reason
Sean Renard was here.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.129
Awfully annoying you didn't kill
him when you had the chance.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.489
Sir, I take full responsibility
for that failure.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.483
No need to take
responsibility, Gregor.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.289
I have bestowed it upon you.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.407
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:39.480 --> 16:40.811
Enter!

16:42.360 --> 16:44.442
Adalind Schade has arrived, sir.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.965
Show her in.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.321
Do you need me to
clear anything away?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.686
Not just now.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.003
Gregor Danilov, may I
present Fraulein Schade.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.201
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

17:00.280 --> 17:02.169
My pleasure.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.804
The pleasure is all mine.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.406
Don't you look lovely.
Thank you.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.608
We'd like you to take a
look at some photographs,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.329
and see if you recognize anyone.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.971
Does this have something
to do with Eric's death?

17:15.760 --> 17:17.125
Take your time.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.528
No, I don't recognize him.
This one?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.964
Nope.
How about this one?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.321
He looks familiar.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.481
VIKTOR: His name's Meisner.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.006
He's from Berlin.
Have you met him?

17:46.320 --> 17:48.971
No, I think I'd remember
if I had.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.764
We believe all three
of these gentlemen

17:50.880 --> 17:52.530
are associated with
a friend of yours.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.290
Sean Renard.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.326
That makes sense.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.042
I think Sean was
in Vienna recently.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.527
There was a note in my
room, signed by him.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.490
Did you see him?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.971
No.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.966
Mmm.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.851
Would you be so kind as to
tell me what the note said?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.207
Of course.

18:27.280 --> 18:32.525
Sean thinks that he may have
found out who killed my mother.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.126
Someone killed your mother?
How tragic.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.123
Yes. I'm still
dealing with it.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.601
Somebody here in Vienna
killed your mother?

18:39.720 --> 18:42.690
No, Portland. Sean
thinks it was the Grimm.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.570
It always comes back
to the Grimm, doesn't it?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.205
We didn't exactly get along.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.801
(GASPING)

18:50.520 --> 18:51.931
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING IN PAIN)

18:53.960 --> 18:56.486
Well, I believe we're done here.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.281
Thank you so much for coming.
Fraulein.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.324
What do you think?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.244
She did admit to getting
a note from Sean Renard.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.850
Given the threat
he's under here in Vienna,

19:10.960 --> 19:14.009
why would he chance leaving a note
for Adalind about her mother?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.923
Could he know she's pregnant?

19:16.080 --> 19:20.290
If he does, I wonder if he knows
she's carrying Eric's child.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.926
If it is Eric's child.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.040
Adalind returned to Portland
last year at Eric's request.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.851
From what I've learned
about Captain Renard,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.730
he not only had a relationship
with Fraulein Schade

19:32.800 --> 19:34.802
but with her mother as well.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.484
That's sort of impressive.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.803
Wouldn't it gum up the works if
she were carrying Sean's child

19:44.880 --> 19:46.166
rather than Eric's?

19:46.760 --> 19:50.287
Either way, the child
would be royal born.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.124
Maybe your failure to kill Sean

19:54.200 --> 19:55.929
was not such
a bad thing after all.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.250
It might behoove us to find
out who the father is.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.969
Sooner rather than later.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.242

and after every meal for seven days.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.651

20:11.400 --> 20:12.811
Thanks very much
for your business.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.530
Hey. I didn't think you
were coming in this early.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.926
Neither did I, but good news.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.286
Just wanted to let you know...

20:21.360 --> 20:22.600
What?

20:23.240 --> 20:25.527
Called my folks and told
them we're getting married.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.566
(SOFTLY) on.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.528
How'd that go?
Actually, pretty well.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.125
I have to say,
they were very excited.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.804
You know, my dad wanted
to know how old you were

20:35.920 --> 20:37.445
and how much money you make.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.010
Seriously?
Yeah.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.282
My dad's very...
Kind of old-fashioned.

20:41.360 --> 20:45.046
Sort of on the blunt side. Some people
are charmed, others are alarmed.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.004
Okay, so when am
I gonna meet them?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.685
Oh, there's no hurry.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.329
And by "no hurry" I mean
the later, the better.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.564

Hi, Mom.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.289
Oh, we're so excited
about you getting married

21:07.360 --> 21:09.124
that we're coming out tomorrow.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.680
We'll be there by 5:30. Don't
worry about picking us up.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.250
Uh, we're renting a car.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.129
Get that extra room
ready for us, though,

21:15.200 --> 21:16.440
'cause we're spending
the whole weekend...

21:16.520 --> 21:17.601
Okay, that's...
...with you.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.125
Your father and I can't wait
to meet your bride-to-be.

I'm glad...

to meet you tomorrow.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.125
Oh, wow, okay. I guess
that's good, right?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.043
They're staying with us.
In the house?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.000
In Nick's room. They always
stay in Nick's room.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.280
I mean, it was their room
before it was Nick's room.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.368
Oh, my God!
We have so much to do!

21:39.440 --> 21:42.205
Please tell me that they
know we're living together.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.044

Can you talk?

21:55.960 --> 21:57.485
Where are you?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.761
In the city.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.687
Danilov was with Viktor
for several hours.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.249
When I brought Adalind
into the room,

22:04.800 --> 22:09.169
I saw photos of Frenay,
Tavitian and Meisner.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.086
Were you in the room
when they questioned her?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.928
How long did they keep her?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.004
Just a few minutes.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.243
Viktor may be getting ready
to make a move on Adalind.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.287
We can't afford
to let them get to her first.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.561
Tell Meisner,
he'll know what to do.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.406
I don't know. I crossed
everything off the list.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.363
Maybe I forgot
to put it on the list.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.204
I'm sorry.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.685
I'm stressing.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.728
Look, a little stress
is to be expected

24:32.800 --> 24:34.245
when you meet parents
for the first time.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.249
I mean, they're my parents
and I'm a little stressed.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.966
My stomach's in knots. Are you
sure they like bratwurst?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.162
Oh, my God, huge bratwurst fans.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.880
You don't even have
to cook it for my dad.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.725
You just light a match under
it and throw it on the floor.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.166
Oh, this is all
happening too fast.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
I just wish they would've
given us a bit more time.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.050
So what should I call them, huh?
Mom and Dad?

24:53.120 --> 24:55.805
Oh, no, I think, Bart and
Alice should be fine.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.561
Okay. Not overly formal.
Are they traditional?

25:00.240 --> 25:01.526
Traditional?

25:01.600 --> 25:04.729
Um, yeah, I guess, in some ways.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.651
What have you
told them about me?

25:08.480 --> 25:10.084
Well...

25:11.920 --> 25:13.843
Your name and...

25:13.920 --> 25:16.287
Wow, first and last?

25:17.320 --> 25:19.049
Lookâ.

25:21.120 --> 25:26.001
I told them you're great and
beautiful and that I love you.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.368
But have I provided
them with a complete,

25:30.440 --> 25:32.442
you know,
Rosalee history? No.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.961
It's probably better,
considering my checkered past.

25:36.080 --> 25:40.130
Believe me, their past is far
from checker-free, so...

25:40.200 --> 25:44.046
You sure they weren't hoping
to meet a nice Blutbaden girl?

25:45.800 --> 25:46.801
Oh...

25:48.440 --> 25:52.240
I think, you know, if I'm
happy, they'll be happy.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.328
You keep saying that,
but they're old-fashioned.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.129
What about us living together?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.850
Look, they're
old-fashioned, okay?

25:57.920 --> 25:59.046
They're not Neanderthals.

Although my great-uncle
Wilhelm had a forehead

26:02.400 --> 26:03.811

26:04.040 --> 26:05.451
Here, flip those pillows.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.761
I just don't want them thinking
that I'm taking advantage of you.

Some people might look at that
and think that I seduced you.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.120
(SCOFFS) Honey, there
is nothing in the world

26:16.200 --> 26:17.690
that would make them think that.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.001
Um...

26:26.200 --> 26:27.850
That's what I forgot.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.728

I'm in the kitchen.

(OPENS BOTTLE)

26:35.000 --> 26:36.570
But not for long. Hey.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.802
So I got an email from your mom.
I just finished tracking her

26:38.880 --> 26:42.009
to Kerkira, which is on the
Greek border of Albania,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.730
but she's not there anymore.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.924
How do you know?
'Cause she's heading north.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.963
Here, will you take a look at
this and tell me what you think?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.528
Sounds like you were doing
a pretty good job yourself.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.961
No, there's more. Look.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.647
NICK: "Juliette,
good you have recovered.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.566
"Tell That would be me.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.165

27:01.240 --> 27:04.449
"Money not spent. Has been
deposited for safekeeping."

27:04.560 --> 27:06.403
I mean, those are the coins
you told me about, right?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.766
Yeah.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.127
That means she didn't
make it to Zakynthos.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.571
But she's hidden them
somewhere, hopefully safe.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.524
"Weather too hot now."

27:16.600 --> 27:19.524
That probably means somebody
is on to her, but who?

27:19.600 --> 27:22.206
I don't know. I mean, she's made
a lot of enemies over the years.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.761
"Returning north to find L."

27:25.840 --> 27:27.524
Yeah, who's "L"?

27:27.600 --> 27:29.762
Probably the Laufer?

27:30.400 --> 27:32.164
The Resistance,
the groups of people

27:32.240 --> 27:33.730
who are uniting
against the Royals.

up to speed with this myself.

"in an unsecured

I don't think that
this is a good idea.

Why not? This could be a way
to protect both of you.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.320
Yeah, with you in the middle?
I'm already in the middle.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.289
And don't forget, I got in
a lot of trouble before

27:59.360 --> 28:00.964
because of things I didn't know.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.767
Look, you have to be very
careful how you deal with this.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.446
I know.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.570
The body was discovered a couple
hours ago by the street cleaner.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.802

on this street.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.008

28:15.760 --> 28:17.524

This guy's a Green Beret, so whoever
took him down had to be good.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.810
In a really bad way.

the make and the year of the car.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.046
Federales in Mexico reported two
similar killings in the last 10 days.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.329
The victims were scalped.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.403
One was an army officer
in MazatlÃ¡n.

28:59.480 --> 29:02.484
The other was identified as a
police officer in San Luis PotosÃ­.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.722
Patrol officer spotted a car
matching the description.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.770
2011 Dodge Challenger parked
on Stark in the southwest.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.842
Make sure the officer knows
not to get near that vehicle

29:09.920 --> 29:10.921
and to stay back.

the original was in Latin,

What? No, I'm not ready for them.
Look at me!

38:27.880 --> 38:30.247
No, honey, you look beautiful.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.526
Just have to get rid of this.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.166
And this.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.245
Really.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

38:36.880 --> 38:38.803
This is the first
impression I get to make.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.081
It's gonna be fine.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.321
(INHALES DEEPLY)

38:41.400 --> 38:42.845
You're beautiful.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.767
You're wonderful. You're
gonna knock 'em out.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.251
(CLOCK TICKING)
Do you hear that?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.529
His Gilbert Front
Mount's out of sync.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.768
Leave his clocks alone.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.807
I think I detect
a woman's touch.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.041
Yeah.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.041
Mom, Dad, this is my
fiancÃ©e, Rosalee.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.607
Honey, these are my parents,
Bart and Alice.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.761
Oh...

39:11.920 --> 39:15.322
Rosalee, it's so
very nice to meet you.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.323
I'm sorry I didn't have
a chance to get cleaned up.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.563
Oh, nonsense. You look just
as beautiful as he said.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.251
(LAUGHS)

39:23.640 --> 39:24.641
(GASPS)

39:26.640 --> 39:28.051
My turn.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.201
Come here.

39:31.800 --> 39:32.801
(GROANS)

39:33.200 --> 39:34.770
No, no, no, no.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.490
A Fuchsbau?

39:36.960 --> 39:39.850
What the hell is going on here?

39:40.800 --> 39:41.801
(SNARLS)

39:42.200 --> 39:43.247
Oh...

39:43.600 --> 39:44.965
(GROWLS)

39:47.320 --> 39:49.288
Monroe, are you
out of your mind?

39:49.360 --> 39:50.486
She's a Fuchsbau.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.768
You didn't tell them? You
were supposed to tell them.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.763
I was going to, but
they're, like, here now,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.569
and I didn't think
it was important.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.290
You guys don't think
it's important, do you?

39:58.360 --> 40:00.727
Well, it's just
a little unsettling.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.926
BART: (SCOFFS) More than
a little unsettling.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.525
This is never going to work.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.529
What are you talking about?
It is working.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.126
Don't be ridiculous. You can
sleep with anything, but...

40:08.200 --> 40:11.044
You have a problem because I'm a
Fuchsbau and your son is Blutbaden?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.167
Seriously?

40:12.240 --> 40:16.211
Well, dear, you can't pretend to
be blind to the situation here.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.084
BART: It's pretty
obvious they are.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.525
Wait until they start
living together.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.045
We are living together.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.763
Wait, you haven't
told them that either?

40:23.840 --> 40:25.524
It's really none of
their business, okay?

40:25.600 --> 40:26.965
I'm sorry, it's none
of your business.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.320
How can you say that?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.084
I'll tell you how
they can say that.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.364
Because they're breaking
the natural law

40:32.440 --> 40:34.681
and they don't care
about the consequences.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.525
What the hell's gonna happen
when you have children?

40:36.640 --> 40:39.291
I'm sorry. I cannot
listen to this ignorance.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.089
I'm leaving. That's
probably a good idea.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.447
What? No. Rosalee!

40:44.840 --> 40:46.126
What have you done?

40:46.200 --> 40:47.361
BART: This is outrageous!

40:47.880 --> 40:49.450
My own flesh and blood.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.090
I don't know what to say.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.967
Rosalee, you can't leave.
Yes, I can.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.326
But I don't care
what they think.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.480
I only care what you think.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.090
I think there's
a bigger problem here.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.969
This is something you have to
figure out with your parents,

41:00.040 --> 41:01.530
and you need to
do that without me.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.891
Rosalee...
No.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.564
I need some time with this.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.122
What the hell is
wrong with you two?

41:13.240 --> 41:14.651
What is wrong with us?
What is wrong with you?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.085
This is not right!

41:16.200 --> 41:18.009
You should've told us
before we came.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.851
Honestly, I didn't think this kind
of stuff still mattered to you.

41:20.920 --> 41:24.720
We've seen how these relationships
tear families apart.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.286
And look what this is...
(SNARLS) Doing to us already.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.404
Oh, Bart. Don't go there.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.130
Rosalee and I are in love,

41:31.400 --> 41:35.121
and we are getting married no
matter what you say or try to do.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.964
This is getting way out of hand.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.042
You need to listen to
what we are telling you!

41:39.120 --> 41:41.566
You touch me again, I swear to God...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

41:42.400 --> 41:43.765
Thank God. She's back.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.850
You do not say a word
unless it's to apologize.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.366
I'm not apologizing for
what's right. Bart.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.327
Rosalee... Oh, Nick. Crap.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.686
I just saw Rosalee drive away.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.205
You okay in here?
Who is this?

41:55.280 --> 41:57.362
Rosalee left, which is what I
think you two should do now.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.726
Oh, we need to stop this.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.689
We go, we are not coming back.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.046
That's fine with me, Dad.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.125
Enough! We're done.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.163
He needs to figure out
who he is!

42:07.600 --> 42:09.170
(GROWLING)

42:09.600 --> 42:10.840
(SNARLING)

42:10.920 --> 42:12.206
A Grimm!

42:12.280 --> 42:13.770
Mom, Dad, no!

42:13.840 --> 42:14.841
(GROWLING)

42:14.960 --> 42:16.041
No!

42:16.120 --> 42:17.724
(SNARLING CONTINUES)
