STUCK AGAIN UP YOUR--

03:40.978 --> 03:41.979
WATCH YOUR LIPS,

03:41.979 --> 03:43.480
BECAUSE THEY MAY
GET YOU INTO SOMETHING

03:43.481 --> 03:46.484
THAT YOUR BEHIND
CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF.

03:46.484 --> 03:48.486
AND YOU
MAY HAVE 2 LEFT FEET

03:48.486 --> 03:49.987

I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
FOR ONE SECOND.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.011

04:14.011 --> 04:15.012

I'M SORRY.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.781
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

05:57.782 --> 05:59.283

06:00.284 --> 06:01.785
THERE'S GOT

06:01.786 --> 06:02.787
THERE'S GOT
TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

06:02.787 --> 06:03.788
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS.

06:03.788 --> 06:05.289
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT!

06:05.289 --> 06:06.290
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CRAZY.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.791
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
SINCE I WAS IN THE ARMY.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.293
YOU DID IT AT SISTER JOAN'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY LAST YEAR.

06:09.293 --> 06:10.294
NOW, THAT
DON'T COUNT.

06:10.294 --> 06:12.796
IT WAS. I SAW IT.

06:12.797 --> 06:14.298
LOOK, I GOT IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

06:14.298 --> 06:15.299
I'M TAKING BETH
TO NEW ORLEANS

06:15.299 --> 06:17.301
FOR THE WEEKEND TO
CELEBRATE OUR ANNIVERSARY.

06:17.301 --> 06:18.802
NOW, YOU AND DEE DEE
COME ALONG

06:18.803 --> 06:19.804
AND HELP US CELEBRATE
OUR ANNIVERSARY,

06:19.804 --> 06:21.305
AND WHILE WE'RE THERE--

06:21.305 --> 06:22.806
NO!
LISTEN TO ME!

06:22.807 --> 06:24.308
SOME OF THESE LODGE
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN THERE

06:24.308 --> 06:25.809
FOR 60 YEARS OR MORE,

06:25.810 --> 06:27.311
AND THEY'RE
OUR RESPONSIBILITY!

06:27.311 --> 06:28.812
YOU BETTER
CHANGE YOUR PANTS

06:28.813 --> 06:31.315
BEFORE PEOPLE THINK
YOU CAN'T HOLD YOUR WATER.

06:32.316 --> 06:34.318
YOU'VE GOTTA DO IT!

07:05.349 --> 07:07.851
WE'RE RUNNING
AN HOUR LATE ALREADY.

07:07.852 --> 07:10.855
MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING
SO LONG IS A GOOD SIGN.

07:10.855 --> 07:11.856
I THINK I BETTER GO IN

07:11.856 --> 07:12.857
AND TELL THEM
TO START THE MEETING.

07:12.857 --> 07:14.358
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

07:20.364 --> 07:23.867
CLYDE, HONEY, THE WORLD
IS NOT RUN ON C.B. TIME.

07:23.868 --> 07:25.369
YOU TWO GONNA BE LATE
FOR YOUR OWN FUNERAL.

07:25.369 --> 07:26.870
I HOPE SO.
BILLY AIN'T HERE?

07:26.871 --> 07:28.372
NO.

07:28.372 --> 07:30.374
WHAT THEY SAY?

07:38.382 --> 07:40.384
BILLY FOSTER,
WILL YOU HURRY UP?

07:40.384 --> 07:42.386
EVERYBODY'S IN THERE
WAITING ON YOU.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.892
BILLY,
WHERE IS OUR CAR?

07:47.892 --> 07:48.893
I SOLD THE CAR.

07:48.893 --> 07:49.894
WHAT YOU SELL
OUR CAR FOR?

07:49.894 --> 07:51.395
I SOLD THE CAR.

07:51.395 --> 07:53.397
IS IT OUR WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW

07:53.397 --> 07:55.899
OR IS IT NOT OUR WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.902
SO WHAT?
SO, FOR 14 YEARS,

07:57.902 --> 07:59.403
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE

07:59.403 --> 08:01.405
FROM SUNRISE TO SUNDOWN,

08:01.405 --> 08:02.906
AND I'VE
NEVER HAD A DOLLAR

08:02.907 --> 08:03.908
TO SPEND NOTHING
ON YOU,

08:03.908 --> 08:06.410
SO I SOLD THE CAR.

08:06.410 --> 08:07.911
I'M TAKING MY WIFE
TO NEW ORLEANS

08:07.912 --> 08:09.413
FOR THE WEEKEND.

08:11.916 --> 08:14.418
A MAN CAN ALWAYS
GET A CHEAP CAR,

08:14.418 --> 08:18.422
BUT HE
CAN'T GET A WIFE.

08:21.926 --> 08:23.427
AIN'T THAT SWEET?

08:23.427 --> 08:24.928
YEAH.

08:24.929 --> 08:25.930
THEY'RE UP
TO SOMETHING.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.431
I KNOW IT.

08:27.431 --> 08:29.766
I AM.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.268
Congregation:
YES, YOU ARE.

08:31.268 --> 08:32.269
AND I'M GONNA BE.

08:32.269 --> 08:33.270
YES, YOU WILL.

08:33.270 --> 08:34.770
TRIUMPH HAVE I?

08:34.772 --> 08:35.773
YES!

08:35.773 --> 08:36.774
STEADY OF HEART?

08:36.774 --> 08:38.275
YES!

08:38.275 --> 08:39.775
NO VALLEY OF SORROW
IS DEEP ENOUGH.

08:39.777 --> 08:40.778
NO!

08:40.778 --> 08:42.780
NO MOUNTAIN OF PLEASURE
IS HIGH ENOUGH.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.780
NO!

08:43.780 --> 08:46.283
TO CAUSE MY FEET
TO STUMBLE ONE STEP

08:46.283 --> 08:47.784
IN OUR EVERLASTING
JOURNEY

08:47.785 --> 08:49.787
TO THE RIGHTEOUS
SIDE OF LIFE.

08:49.787 --> 08:51.288
PRAISE TO HIM!

08:51.288 --> 08:53.790
AND MARCHING OUT AT THE HEAD
OF OUR GREAT MULTITUDE

08:53.791 --> 08:55.793
TO SHOW US THE WAY
IS OUR FOUNDER.

08:55.793 --> 08:57.795
THE GREAT, GREAT, GREAT
GRAND WARRIOR

08:57.795 --> 08:59.296
OF THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA.

08:59.296 --> 09:01.798
PRAISE TO THE KINGDOM!

09:01.799 --> 09:04.301
HE STAMPED HIS FEET
ON THE GROUND THAT IS AFRICA

09:04.301 --> 09:06.803
AND THE EARTH TREMBLED.

09:06.804 --> 09:08.806
TO THE EVIL,
HE SHOWS NO MERCY.

09:08.806 --> 09:10.307
NO!

09:10.307 --> 09:12.309
TO THE DECEITFUL,
HIS BLOWS ARE SWIFT.

09:12.309 --> 09:13.810
YES!

09:13.811 --> 09:15.813
BUT TO
THE PURE IN HEART,

09:15.813 --> 09:17.314
HE IS LOVE.

09:17.314 --> 09:19.316
LOVE, BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

09:19.316 --> 09:21.318
HE IS OUR LEADER.

09:21.318 --> 09:23.320
THE GREAT, GREAT,
GREAT GRAND WARRIOR

09:23.320 --> 09:25.322
OF THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA!

09:25.322 --> 09:27.824
ALL PRAISES DUE
TO OUR FOUNDER!

09:27.825 --> 09:29.326
ALL PRAISES DUE

09:29.326 --> 09:31.828
TO THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA!

09:49.847 --> 09:53.350
BROTHERS AND SISTERS...

09:53.350 --> 09:55.852
ANOTHER DAY HAS DAWNED,

09:55.853 --> 09:56.854
AND THOUGH WE ARE HERE

09:56.854 --> 09:58.856
IN OUR GOOD HEALTH
AND STRENGTH,

09:58.856 --> 10:01.358
TODAY IS NOT A GOOD DAY
FOR US.

10:01.358 --> 10:03.860
THE CITY HAS REFUSED

10:03.861 --> 10:06.363
TO GRANT US THE EXTENSION
THAT WE WANTED.

10:07.865 --> 10:10.367
AND SO I GUESS THE BEST WAY
TO START THIS MEETING

10:10.367 --> 10:12.869
IS WITH A FINANCIAL REPORT
ON OUR SITUATION

10:12.870 --> 10:16.373
FROM OUR TREASURER,
BROTHER BILLY FOSTER.

10:20.878 --> 10:22.880
WELL, WE ALL
KNOW THE SITUATION.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.882
WE HAVE KNOWN
FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS

10:24.882 --> 10:26.884
THAT THIS CITY WAS GONNA
TURN DOWN THIS SECTION

10:26.884 --> 10:28.886
COMMENCING NEXT YEAR.

10:28.886 --> 10:32.890
IN 6 WEEKS, WE'VE GOT
TO BE OUT OF THIS BUILDING.

10:34.391 --> 10:36.393
2 YEARS AGO,
Y'ALL MADE PLEDGES

10:36.393 --> 10:37.894
TO THE NEW BUILDING FUND,

10:37.895 --> 10:39.897
AND YOU'VE FULFILLED
THOSE PLEDGES,

10:39.897 --> 10:41.398
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

10:41.398 --> 10:42.899
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS,

10:42.900 --> 10:44.902
WE'VE BEEN
RAKING AND SCRAPING,

10:44.902 --> 10:48.906
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH.

10:48.906 --> 10:51.408
THE INITIAL COST
OF THE CONSTRUCTION

10:51.408 --> 10:53.410
IS $55,000.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.412
THAT MEANS WE GOT
TO HAVE AT LEAST THAT

10:55.412 --> 10:57.914
BEFORE WE CAN START.

10:57.915 --> 10:59.416
AND SO FAR IN THE KITTY,

10:59.416 --> 11:02.919
WE'VE GOT $18,000.

11:04.922 --> 11:06.924
NOW WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

11:06.924 --> 11:08.926
WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

11:08.926 --> 11:09.927
FIGHT IT.

11:09.927 --> 11:12.429
TIGHTEN UP AND DIG DEEPER.

11:12.429 --> 11:14.431
NOW, I KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH.

11:14.431 --> 11:16.933
IT IS NOW OR NEVER.

11:19.937 --> 11:21.438
NOW THE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS OF SHAKA

11:21.438 --> 11:24.441
HAVE ALWAYS THRIVED
ON ADVERSITY.

11:24.441 --> 11:25.442
THAT'S RIGHT!

11:25.442 --> 11:27.944
WE LIVE TO OVERCOME
SUFFERING.

11:27.945 --> 11:28.946
YES!

11:28.946 --> 11:32.449
WE LIVE TO CREATE LIGHT
WHERE THERE WAS DARKNESS.

11:32.449 --> 11:33.450
YES!

11:33.450 --> 11:35.452
WE HAVE GOT TO PUT
OUR HEART IN IT.

11:35.452 --> 11:36.453
YES!

11:36.453 --> 11:37.954
WE'VE GOT TO PUT
OUR SOUL IN IT.

11:37.955 --> 11:39.456
YES!

11:39.456 --> 11:41.458
WE'VE GOTTA PUT
OUR SPIRITS IN IT.

11:41.458 --> 11:42.459
YES!

11:42.459 --> 11:44.461
AND WE'VE GOT TO PUT
SOME MORE MONEY IN IT!

12:58.535 --> 13:01.037
THAT MONEY
SHOULD BE IN A BANK!

13:01.038 --> 13:04.041
IT WAS.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.543
WE CAN GO TO JAIL
IF THIS DON'T WORK.

13:06.543 --> 13:07.544
IT'S GONNA WORK.

13:07.544 --> 13:09.045
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

13:09.046 --> 13:10.047
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
STILL GOT THE TOUCH

13:10.047 --> 13:12.049
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
AT SISTER JOAN'S PARTY

13:12.049 --> 13:13.550
WITH VICTOR BROWN,

13:13.550 --> 13:14.551
YOU HAD HIM
GOING AROUND THERE

13:14.551 --> 13:16.553
CROWING LIKE A ROOSTER
IN A HENHOUSE.

13:16.553 --> 13:19.055
ROOOOO!

13:19.056 --> 13:20.557
KOO-KOO-ROO!

13:20.557 --> 13:23.059
THAT'S RIGHT.
HEH HEH HEH!

13:23.060 --> 13:25.062
$2,000.

13:25.062 --> 13:26.563
MORTGAGED
MY FURNITURE,

13:26.563 --> 13:28.064
SOLD MY CAR, CLOSED
OUT MY BANK ACCOUNT.

13:28.065 --> 13:29.566
$2,000 FROM ME.

13:29.566 --> 13:31.568
$18,000
FROM THE LODGE.

13:31.568 --> 13:33.570
$20,000.

13:33.570 --> 13:34.571
$20,000.

13:34.571 --> 13:37.073
20,000.

13:37.074 --> 13:39.076
NO. UN-UH.

13:39.076 --> 13:40.577
NO, MAN. I'M A MILKMAN.

13:40.577 --> 13:42.579
YOU'RE A FACTORY WORKER!
WE DON'T LOOK LIKE NOBODY

13:42.579 --> 13:44.581
WHO'D COME UP
WITH NO $20,000.

13:44.581 --> 13:46.082
WE GONNA LOOK LIKE
WE GOT A MILLION.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.584
HOW?

13:47.584 --> 13:48.585
YOU JUST LEAVE THAT
UP TO ME.

13:48.585 --> 13:51.087
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

13:58.095 --> 14:01.598
OUR WOMEN MUST NEVER
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

14:01.598 --> 14:03.600
NEVER. THEY'RE JUST
GOING TO NEW ORLEANS

14:03.600 --> 14:05.602
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

14:16.113 --> 14:19.616

IS, UM, THAT
ALL I'M GONNA GET?

16:24.908 --> 16:26.409
WELL, THAT'S ALL YOU
GONNA GET IN PUBLIC.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.912
HO HO HO!
OHH! STOP!

16:28.912 --> 16:30.914
WHOO!

16:30.914 --> 16:32.916
YOU FRESH THING!

16:32.916 --> 16:33.917
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.920
YES, I DO.
WHOO!

16:36.920 --> 16:38.922
AND TONIGHT, I'M GONNA
LAY A BLOCKBUSTER ON YOU

16:38.922 --> 16:40.423
TONIGHT.

16:40.424 --> 16:41.425
YEAH?

16:41.425 --> 16:42.426
WELL, I'M GONNA
HAVE A BLOCK

16:42.426 --> 16:43.927
FOR YOU
TO BUST, TOO, BABY,

16:43.927 --> 16:45.428
SO YOU BETTER BRING
A WHOLE LOT OF HAMMER.

16:45.429 --> 16:48.432
HAVE HAMMER, WILL TRAVEL

16:48.432 --> 16:50.934
AND GO DEEP
INTO YOUR CREVICE.

16:53.937 --> 16:54.938
Beth!

16:54.938 --> 16:56.940
WELL,
IT'S THE TRUTH.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.442
WELL, I KNOW,
BUT I CERTAINLY WISH

16:59.443 --> 17:01.445
YOU TWO WOULD STOP
PUTTING YOUR BUSINESS

17:01.445 --> 17:02.946
IN THE STREET LIKE THAT,
AND THAT'S ALL.

17:02.946 --> 17:04.948
ARE YOU GONNA SIT
THERE AND ACT ALL PROPER

17:04.948 --> 17:05.949
LIKE CLYDE
AIN'T BEEN HITTING

17:05.949 --> 17:07.951
YOUR SWITCH
REGULARLY?

17:07.951 --> 17:09.953
UH-UH! I AIN'T IN IT.

17:09.953 --> 17:10.954
I COULD SAY
SOMETHING,

17:10.954 --> 17:13.455
BUT I WON'T.
HEH HEH!

17:13.457 --> 17:15.959
OF COURSE CLYDE
AND ME HAVE RELATIONS.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.460
WE CERTAINLY DON'T LET

17:17.461 --> 17:19.963
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW
ABOUT IT. DO WE, HONEY?

17:19.963 --> 17:22.464
UH-UH. ME AND DEE DEE,
WE DON'T MAKE NO NOISE.

17:22.465 --> 17:25.469
WE WHISPER A LOT.
HEH HEH HEH!

17:29.473 --> 17:30.974
OH, BABY, OH, BABY!

17:30.974 --> 17:33.476
SHH!

17:33.477 --> 17:35.479
WE ALL GROWN.

17:35.479 --> 17:36.480
AND WE KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.481
BESIDES, IT'S
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

17:37.481 --> 17:39.983
YES, WELL, I KNOW THAT.

17:39.983 --> 17:41.985
BUT SUPPOSE SOMEBODY
WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOU

17:41.985 --> 17:42.986
HEARD YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

17:42.986 --> 17:43.987
I MEAN,
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?

17:43.987 --> 17:45.488
THEY WOULD SAY
I WAS HAVING

17:45.489 --> 17:46.990
A HORNY CONVERSATION
WITH A MAN

17:46.990 --> 17:48.491
IN A FANCY
RESTAURANT,

17:48.492 --> 17:49.993
AND HE WAS PICKING
UP ON MY VIBE.

17:49.993 --> 17:52.495
PICKING UP ON THEM.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.501
DEE DEE,
I DIDN'T KNOW

17:57.501 --> 17:59.002
YOU WERE A PRUDE.

17:59.002 --> 18:01.004
WELL, I AM NOT A PRU--

18:01.004 --> 18:03.506
I AM NOT A PRUDE.

18:03.507 --> 18:06.009
BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS THAT I WON'T DO,

18:06.009 --> 18:08.011
AND THAT'S ALL.

18:09.012 --> 18:12.515
WELL, LA-DEE-DA.

18:19.022 --> 18:20.523
HEH HEH HEH!

18:40.076 --> 18:42.578
BABY, THAT
WAS A GOOD LUNCH.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.080
NOW I'M READY
FOR A NAP,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.082
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A WEE-WEE.

18:46.082 --> 18:48.084
DEE DEE,
COME ON AND GO

18:48.084 --> 18:49.585
TO THE POWDER ROOM
WITH ME.

18:49.586 --> 18:53.089
COME ON, GIRL.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.603
YOU TELL ME WHY?
WHY?

19:12.609 --> 19:14.611
THE FELLA
WITH THE PINK FLOWER,

19:14.611 --> 19:18.114
THE BIGGEST OF THE BIG-TIME
GAMBLERS IN LOUISIANA.

19:18.114 --> 19:21.117
KANSAS CITY MACK. OWNS
THIS RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE.

19:21.117 --> 19:23.119
YOUR BOOKS DON'T LOOK GOOD
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

19:23.119 --> 19:25.121
22% OFF CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE THING--

19:25.121 --> 19:26.622
BAD MANAGEMENT.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.625
YOU, YOU GOT TO START
INCREASING YOUR VOLUME NOW

19:28.625 --> 19:29.626
IN ALL YOUR OPERATIONS,

19:29.626 --> 19:31.628
ESPECIALLY IN THE GAMBLING
AND JOY HOUSES

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
AND THE LIQUOR BUSINESS.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.630
BOSS, INFLATION--

19:33.630 --> 19:35.131
INFLATION AIN'T BOTHERING
BIGGIE SMALLS

19:35.131 --> 19:36.632
AND HIS BOYS IN KENTUCKY
AND ALABAMA.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.635
THEY'RE ROLLING RIGHT ALONG,
HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.637
AND IT'S YOUR TERRITORY
THEY'RE GONNA GRAB FIRST.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.639
WE'RE PUSHING
AS HARD AS WE CAN.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.140
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT
7 DAYS A WEEK.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.641
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP

19:45.642 --> 19:47.143
WITH SOME NEW IDEAS.

19:47.143 --> 19:48.144
THAT'S WHY BIGGIE SMALLS
AND HIS BOYS

19:48.144 --> 19:49.645
KEEP BEATING US
TO THE PUNCH.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.147
HE GOT THEM YOUNG,
COLLEGE-EDUCATED FAGGOTS

19:51.147 --> 19:52.648
DOING HIS THINKING
FOR HIM.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.150
MAYBE Y'ALL TOO OLD.

19:54.150 --> 19:57.153
MAYBE Y'ALL NEED
TO TAKE A WALK.

19:57.153 --> 19:58.654
MAYBE I OUGHT
TO GET SOME OF THEM

19:58.655 --> 20:00.156
YOUNG COLLEGE-EDUCATED
FAGGOTS

20:00.156 --> 20:03.159
TO DO MY THINKING
FOR ME, HUH? HUH?

20:05.662 --> 20:07.664
NOW, HOW THINGS LOOKING
ON THIS FIGHT?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.666
NOT SO GOOD. WE'RE
GETTING PLENTY OF ACTION

20:09.666 --> 20:11.668
ON 40th STREET BLACK,
BUT NOTHING ON FARNSWORTH.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.169
WELL, THAT FIGURES.
EVEN FARNSWORTH'S MAMA

20:13.169 --> 20:14.670
AIN'T DUMB ENOUGH
TO BET ON HIM.

20:14.671 --> 20:15.672
WELL, LOOK,
USE YOUR HEADS.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.173
IF THERE AIN'T NO
FARNSWORTH MONEY AROUND,

20:17.173 --> 20:19.675
CLOSE YOUR BOOKS
AND SIT THIS ONE OUT.

20:35.492 --> 20:37.994
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME TO THE TRAINING CAMP

20:37.994 --> 20:39.996

20:43.500 --> 20:46.002
RIGHT HERE IN THE FABULOUS
CITY OF NEW ORLEANS

20:46.002 --> 20:47.503
AT THE SPORTS CENTER.

20:47.504 --> 20:49.506
HE IS NOW
COMING TO THE RING

20:49.506 --> 20:51.508
TO SPAR IN 3 ROUNDS
OF BOXING

20:51.508 --> 20:53.009
FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.

20:54.511 --> 20:56.012
40th STREET BLACK!

20:56.012 --> 20:58.014
LET'S HEAR IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

21:32.549 --> 21:34.551
ANYBODY
RUNNING INTO HIM

21:34.551 --> 21:37.053
BETTER BE DRIVING
A MACK TRUCK.

21:54.571 --> 21:57.073
OK, LET'S GO SEE
THE CHALLENGER.

21:57.073 --> 21:58.074
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

21:58.074 --> 21:59.075
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH.

21:59.075 --> 22:00.576
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.081
COME ON, BOOTNEY,
KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP,

22:05.081 --> 22:06.582
KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP,
PROTECT YOURSELF, BABY!

22:06.583 --> 22:08.585
PROTECT YOURSELF!
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, JAB!

22:08.585 --> 22:10.086
JAB, JAB, JAB, JAB!

22:10.086 --> 22:11.587
THERE YOU GO,
THERE YOU GO!

22:11.588 --> 22:13.089
THROW THEM PUNCHES IN,
THROW THEM PUNCHES IN.

22:13.089 --> 22:14.590
MOVE, MOVE,
BOOTNEY, MOVE!

22:16.092 --> 22:17.093
OOH!

22:17.093 --> 22:18.594
HEY, HONEY, BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH
IS KNOCKING OUT

22:18.595 --> 22:20.096
HIS FELLAS, TOO.

22:20.096 --> 22:22.598
NO, DEAR, THAT'S
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH THERE.

22:29.606 --> 22:30.607
LOOK, LOOK HERE.

22:34.110 --> 22:36.612
MOVE. USE YOUR JAB.
UNDERSTAND?

22:36.613 --> 22:37.614
DON'T TRY
TO SLUG IT OUT.

22:37.614 --> 22:39.115
IF YOU GET TAGGED,
CLENCH.

22:39.115 --> 22:41.117
KEEP YOUR GLOVES UP HIGH
AND PROTECT YOURSELF.

22:41.117 --> 22:42.118
OK, LET'S GO.

22:42.118 --> 22:44.120
GO GET HIM.
TAKE HIM.

22:45.622 --> 22:47.624
PUNCH, PUNCH!

22:47.624 --> 22:49.626
COVER UP!
MOVE IT, MOVE!

22:55.131 --> 22:58.134
40th STREET BLACK IS
GONNA KILL THAT POOR BABY.

23:06.142 --> 23:08.144
HERE'S
YOUR PRESS CARD.

23:08.144 --> 23:09.145
WHERE'D
YOU GET THESE?

23:09.145 --> 23:11.147
I PRINTED THEM UP
MYSELF.

23:28.665 --> 23:31.668
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS GOT
ONE MINUTE AND THAT'S IT.

23:31.668 --> 23:33.169
MY FIGHTER'S GOTTA EAT
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

23:33.169 --> 23:34.670
ON THE BASIS
OF YOUR LAST FIGHT,

23:34.671 --> 23:35.672
A SPLIT DECISION
OVER MARTIN,

23:35.672 --> 23:37.173
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE
A SHOT AT THE TITLE?

23:37.173 --> 23:38.674
MARTIN WAS A PUSHOVER.

23:38.675 --> 23:40.176
BOOTNEY WAS CARRYING HIM.

23:40.176 --> 23:41.677
I HEAR YOUR SPARRING
PARTNER DECKED YOU TODAY.

23:41.678 --> 23:42.679
HE SLIPPED.

23:42.679 --> 23:44.180
Second reporter:
BOOTNEY, WORD'S GOING AROUND

23:44.180 --> 23:45.181
THAT YOU'RE
NOT REALLY IN SHAPE.

23:45.181 --> 23:46.182
WHAT DO YOU SAY
ABOUT THAT?

23:46.182 --> 23:48.184
LIES, PROPAGANDA!

23:48.184 --> 23:49.685
THEN WHY ARE YOU
A 5-TO-1 UNDERDOG?

23:49.686 --> 23:51.688
BECAUSE WE DO OUR
FIGHTING IN THE RING,

23:51.688 --> 23:53.690
NOT IN THE NEWSPAPER
LIKE THAT BIG-MOUTH,

23:53.690 --> 23:55.191
EMPTY-HEADED SISSY.

23:55.191 --> 23:56.192
CAN WE QUOTE
YOU, BOOTNEY?

23:56.192 --> 23:58.694
YEAH, YOU CAN QUOTE HIM!
YOU TELL THE WORLD

23:58.695 --> 24:00.196
WHEN WE GET THROUGH
WITH 40th STREET BLACK

24:00.196 --> 24:02.698
HE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
30th STREET YELLOW.

24:02.699 --> 24:04.200
BOOTNEY,
ANY TRUTH TO THE RUMOR

24:04.200 --> 24:05.701
THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING
A SECRET PUNCH?

24:05.702 --> 24:08.204
DON'T ANSWER THAT,
BOOTNEY!

24:08.204 --> 24:09.205
EVERYTHING
IN ITS PROPER PLACE.

24:09.205 --> 24:11.207
IF YOU LOSE, BOOTNEY,
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

24:11.207 --> 24:12.708
WE CAN'T ANSWER THAT,

24:12.709 --> 24:15.211
BECAUSE LOSING'S THE LAST
THING WE THINK ABOUT.

24:15.211 --> 24:16.212
Reporter:
HOW LONG'S

24:16.212 --> 24:17.213
THE FIGHT GONNA
LAST, BOOTNEY?

24:17.213 --> 24:18.714
IT WON'T GO THE DISTANCE.

24:18.715 --> 24:20.717
BOOTNEY, IF YOU WIN,
WILL YOU BE AN ACTIVE CHAMPION?

24:20.717 --> 24:22.218
WE'LL FIGHT ANYBODY,
ANYWHERE.

24:22.218 --> 24:23.719
ONE LITTLE PERSONAL
QUESTION, BOOTNEY.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.221
HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE?

24:27.223 --> 24:31.227
HOW'S HIS LOVE LIFE?
HOW'S HIS LOVE LIFE?!

24:31.227 --> 24:34.730
HE'S GOT HIS HANDS FULL!

24:34.731 --> 24:36.733
OK, IT'S TIME TO GIVE
MY FIGHTER SOME REST.

24:36.733 --> 24:38.234
SO UP AND OUT, LET'S GO.

24:38.234 --> 24:39.235
YOU KNOW WHAT TO WRITE,

24:39.235 --> 24:40.236
YOU KNOW
WHAT PICTURES TO PRINT.

24:40.236 --> 24:41.737
I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING DOWN.

24:41.738 --> 24:44.240
WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN WE
WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP, OK?

24:44.240 --> 24:46.242
OUT YOU GO, FELLAS.
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING BY.

24:46.242 --> 24:48.244
APPRECIATE IT A LOT.

24:57.754 --> 25:01.758
MR. ELLISON.

25:01.758 --> 25:03.259
YOU REALLY THINK
I GOT A CHANCE?

25:03.259 --> 25:05.761
HE'S GONNA BEAT
YOUR BRAINS IN, BOOTNEY.

25:08.264 --> 25:10.266
BOOTNEY...

25:10.266 --> 25:12.768
BOOTNEY...

25:12.769 --> 25:16.773
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING,
BUT WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO--

25:18.274 --> 25:21.777
YES, YOU DO
HAVE A CHANCE, SON.

25:21.778 --> 25:22.779
BUT NOT
A GOOD ONE, HUH?

25:22.779 --> 25:26.282
NO, NOT A GOOD CHANCE.

25:26.282 --> 25:27.783
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

25:29.786 --> 25:32.288
COME ON, KID.
GET SOME REST.

25:32.288 --> 25:34.790
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER DAY'S
WORK AHEAD OF US.

26:07.991 --> 26:10.994
Bootney Farnsworth,
Bootney Farnsworth,

26:10.994 --> 26:12.996
can you hear me?

26:19.502 --> 26:22.505
Listen to the rhythm
of the chimes.

26:22.505 --> 26:25.007
Listen to the rhythm
of my voice.

26:25.008 --> 26:26.509
You are going

26:26.509 --> 26:28.010
into the deepest part
of your sleep.

26:28.011 --> 26:31.514
Deeper and deeper
and deeper and deeper.

26:31.514 --> 26:34.016
Deeper, deeper.

26:34.017 --> 26:37.020
Now your subconscious
belongs to me.

26:43.526 --> 26:45.528
Open your eyes.

26:51.034 --> 26:54.037
IN THE INNERMOST
REACHES OF YOUR HEART,

26:54.037 --> 26:56.539
YOU ARE A TIGER.

26:56.539 --> 26:58.541
TIGER!

26:58.541 --> 27:01.043
YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF GREAT FEATS

27:01.044 --> 27:03.046
OF STRENGTH
AND COURAGE.

27:03.046 --> 27:06.549
STRENGTH AND COURAGE!

27:06.549 --> 27:09.552
YOU CAN BEAT ANY
FIGHTER IN THE WORLD.

27:09.552 --> 27:12.555
YOU WILL WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

27:12.555 --> 27:14.557
OHH--

27:14.557 --> 27:15.558
I WILL?

27:15.558 --> 27:18.561
YES.

27:18.561 --> 27:20.062
OUT OF SIGHT!

27:21.564 --> 27:23.566
TOMORROW AT YOUR
SPARRING SESSION,

27:23.566 --> 27:25.568
YOU WILL DEMONSTRATE
ALL THE POWER

27:25.568 --> 27:26.569
YOU ARE CAPABLE OF,

27:26.569 --> 27:28.070
AND ON THE NIGHT
OF THE FIGHT,

27:28.071 --> 27:30.573
YOU WILL WIN OVER
40th STREET BLACK.

27:30.573 --> 27:32.575
WIN!

27:32.575 --> 27:33.576

27:49.592 --> 27:51.093
GO TO SLEEP.

27:54.597 --> 27:56.599
Go to sleep.

27:56.599 --> 27:59.101
Sleep, sleep.

27:59.102 --> 28:02.605
Sleep, sleep.

28:05.108 --> 28:08.111
Win, win.

28:08.111 --> 28:10.113
Win, win.

29:06.669 --> 29:08.170
What are we gonna do?

29:08.171 --> 29:10.173
The fire escape.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.721
What are we
gonna do?

29:58.721 --> 30:00.723
You can't
go down there.

30:05.728 --> 30:07.229
What you gonna do?

30:07.230 --> 30:09.232
We're gonna put knots
in these sheets,

30:09.232 --> 30:10.233
throw 'em out
the window,

30:10.233 --> 30:13.236
and climb down.

30:13.236 --> 30:14.737
You're crazy!

30:14.737 --> 30:16.739
We can't go down there
on these!

30:16.739 --> 30:18.741
Are you crazy?
Do you know

30:18.741 --> 30:19.742
what they'll
do to us

30:19.742 --> 30:21.744
if they catch us?

32:14.357 --> 32:16.859
KEEP MOVING, FOOL!

32:49.725 --> 32:52.227
WOULD YOU GET YOUR FOOT
OUT THE WAY?

33:23.259 --> 33:25.761
AAH!

34:09.304 --> 34:10.806

36:01.917 --> 36:03.919
REGARDING A SINGLE
OCCUPANCY ROOM

36:03.919 --> 36:05.921

36:34.450 --> 36:37.453
ANYTHING YOU SAY MAY

36:37.453 --> 36:38.454
Billy:

36:38.454 --> 36:41.457
BECAUSE WE'VE

37:54.530 --> 37:56.031
YOU WANNA TAKE US DOWN?

37:56.031 --> 37:57.532
FORGET ABOUT IT,

38:09.545 --> 38:13.549
NOTHING BUT HORSE
THE REST OF THE WAY, FELLAS.

38:13.549 --> 38:16.051
THAT'S ALL.

39:21.617 --> 39:24.953
WE BELIEVE IN CHANGE,
AND WE'RE PREPARED FOR IT

39:24.953 --> 39:28.456
WITH NEW TECHNIQUES
AND NEW APPROACHES,

39:28.457 --> 39:30.459
AND AS FOR OUR PART,
WE FEEL THAT YOU'RE

39:30.459 --> 39:31.960

THANK YOU,

INTO THIS AREA PEACEFULLY.

39:40.469 --> 39:41.970
NO VIOLENCE.

39:41.970 --> 39:45.473
BUT IF MACK AND HIS BOYS
PROVE, UH, STUBBORN,

39:45.474 --> 39:47.476

42:13.622 --> 42:15.123
WHEN WE GO
TO THE LOCAL BOOKIES

42:15.123 --> 42:18.126
AIN'T NONE OF THEM

01:00:15.036 --> 01:00:16.537
AND YOU CAN
COUNT ON IT."

01:00:16.537 --> 01:00:17.538
THEY'RE HERE
TO HELP THE LODGE

01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:18.539
MAKE SOME MONEY.

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:21.041
MONEY?
SOMEBODY SAY MONEY?

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.543
YES, GRAND SUPREME,
UM--

01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:26.547
THESE, UM, THIS IS
MR. MacARTHUR CLUTCH

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.048
AND HIS ASSOCIATES--
A BROKERAGE.

01:00:28.049 --> 01:00:29.550
WELL, NOW.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.051
HOW DO YOU DO, GENTLEMEN?
HOW DO YOU DO?

01:00:31.052 --> 01:00:32.553
JUST FINE, SIR.

01:00:32.553 --> 01:00:34.054
ACTUALLY, THERE'S
NOT TOO MUCH TO DISCUSS

01:00:34.055 --> 01:00:35.056
AT THIS TIME,
GRAND SUPREME,

01:00:35.056 --> 01:00:36.557
JUST A FEW
MINOR DETAILS

01:00:36.557 --> 01:00:38.559
FOR PRELIMINARY
PURPOSES.

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:39.560
BUT I WAS WONDERING

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.061
IF I MIGHT BORROW
YOUR TREASURER

01:00:41.062 --> 01:00:42.063
TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER
IN PRIVATE.

01:00:42.063 --> 01:00:44.065
YOU KNOW,
ALL THE BORING DETAILS.

01:00:44.065 --> 01:00:45.566
WELL, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE JUST FINE.

01:00:47.068 --> 01:00:48.569
NOW, UH, I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU MYSELF,

01:00:48.569 --> 01:00:50.571
BUT MY PLACE
IS DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.

01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:52.072
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
BROTHER WILLIAMS ALONG

01:00:52.073 --> 01:00:53.574
AS MY PROXY?

01:00:53.574 --> 01:00:57.578
OOH, I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU
IF THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.

01:00:57.578 --> 01:00:58.579
OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

01:00:58.579 --> 01:01:00.581
NOW, BETH AND DEE DEE,
SHOW THESE KIND GENTLEMEN

01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:02.082
RIGHT UP TO MY OFFICE.

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:03.584
WE'LL JUST
BE A MINUTE.

01:01:03.584 --> 01:01:06.086
US BREAKERS DON'T TAKE
TOO LONG TO DO NOTHING.

01:01:06.087 --> 01:01:07.088
WON'T YOU
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE?

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:23.771
WELL, WE'LL SEE Y'ALL

01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:25.272
WHEN YOU GET
DOWNSTAIRS, HEAR?

01:01:26.774 --> 01:01:29.276
BYE, BABY.

01:01:32.279 --> 01:01:33.780
I'M GONNA KILL 'EM!

01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:35.282
OH, WAIT!
WAIT A MINUTE!

01:01:35.282 --> 01:01:37.284
WAIT! WAIT!

01:01:37.284 --> 01:01:39.286
WAIT!
WAIT A MINUTE!

01:01:39.286 --> 01:01:41.288
WAIT! WAIT!

01:01:41.288 --> 01:01:42.289
NOT NOW,
BUBBLETOP.

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:43.790
NOT HERE.

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:45.292
I'LL MURDERIZE 'EM!

01:01:45.292 --> 01:01:46.293
I'M GONNA LET YOU
HAVE 'EM, BUBBLETOP.

01:01:46.293 --> 01:01:47.294
YOU CAN PICK 'EM
CLEAN,

01:01:47.294 --> 01:01:48.295
BUT FIRST WE TALK.

01:01:48.295 --> 01:01:50.297
DISHONEST CROOKS.
HYPOCRITSITS.

01:01:50.297 --> 01:01:53.300
YOU MADE FOOLS OF US,
MR. MONGO SLADE.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.302
YOU WON A SMALL VICTORY,
BUT YOU GONNA LOSE THE WAR.

01:01:55.302 --> 01:01:56.803
YOUR WIVES
GONNA BE WIDOWS

01:01:56.804 --> 01:01:57.805
AND YOUR LODGE GONNA BE
MARCHING BACK AND FORTH

01:01:57.805 --> 01:01:59.306
TO THE CEMETERY.

01:01:59.306 --> 01:02:00.807
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:02:00.808 --> 01:02:02.810
I'M TALKING ABOUT
FARNSWORTH'S HYPNOSIS

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.311
AND 10 GRAND
AT 5-TO-1.

01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:08.315
HYPNOSIS? WE DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT NO HYPNOSIS.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:09.816
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HYPNOSIS?

01:02:09.817 --> 01:02:11.819
NO, WE DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT NO HYPNOSIS.

01:02:11.819 --> 01:02:13.320
BUBBLETOP KNOWS
ABOUT HYPNOSIS.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.822
WANT HIM TO SHOW YOU
WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT IT?

01:02:15.823 --> 01:02:16.824
NO!
NO!

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:18.826
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE--WE--

01:02:18.826 --> 01:02:21.328
WE KNOW A LITTLE
ABOUT HYPNOSIS.

01:02:21.328 --> 01:02:22.829
JUST A LITTLE.

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:24.331
YOU PUT THE WHAMMY
ON FARNSWORTH,

01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:25.332
MADE HIM THINK
HE WAS SUPERMAN.

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:27.334
THEN YOU PUT THE BITE
ON US AND DISAPPEARED.

01:02:27.334 --> 01:02:28.835
TOOK A WHILE
TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:02:28.836 --> 01:02:29.837
AND A WHILE LONGER
TO FIND YOU,

01:02:29.837 --> 01:02:31.338
BUT WE GOT
YOUR ASSES NOW.

01:02:35.843 --> 01:02:37.344
WHAT YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT FOR?

01:02:37.344 --> 01:02:39.346
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PUT
THE WHAMMY ON FARNSWORTH--

01:02:39.346 --> 01:02:40.847
DON'T YOU LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

01:02:45.352 --> 01:02:46.353
AND DON'T LOOK AT NONE
OF MY BOYS, NEITHER.

01:02:46.353 --> 01:02:47.854
LOOK AT HIM.

01:02:49.356 --> 01:02:51.858
ANY OF YOU GUYS
FEEL SLEEPY?

01:03:06.874 --> 01:03:08.375
NOW CUT THAT OUT!

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:09.376
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO PUT THE WHAMMY

01:03:09.376 --> 01:03:10.377
ON PEOPLE LIKE THAT?

01:03:10.377 --> 01:03:12.879
IN THE ARMY.
MEDICAL CORP.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.381
WELL, BUBBLETOP
GONNA PUT BOTH Y'ALL

01:03:14.381 --> 01:03:15.882
TO SLEEP SOON ENOUGH
IF YOU DON'T JUMP

01:03:15.883 --> 01:03:17.384
AT THIS PROPOSITION
I'M GONNA LAY ON YOU.

01:03:17.384 --> 01:03:19.386
PROPOSITION?

01:03:22.389 --> 01:03:24.391
WHAT--
WHAT PROPOSITION?

01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:28.896
ONE THAT
WILL GET OUR MONEY BACK

01:03:28.896 --> 01:03:30.898
AND AT THE SAME TIME
WE WIPE OUT BIGGIE SMALLS,

01:03:30.898 --> 01:03:33.901
PUT HIM OUT
OF BUSINESS FOR GOOD.

01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:35.402
THE REMATCH
BETWEEN FARNSWORTH

01:03:35.402 --> 01:03:36.903
AND 40th STREET BLACK
IS COMING UP

01:03:36.904 --> 01:03:38.906
ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT.

01:03:38.906 --> 01:03:40.908
THE 6 OF US IN THIS ROOM
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE

01:03:40.908 --> 01:03:42.409
IN THE WORLD THAT KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

01:03:42.409 --> 01:03:44.411
NOT FARNSWORTH
NOR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE

01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:46.413
HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
WHAT WENT DOWN.

01:03:46.413 --> 01:03:47.414
QUIET AS IT'S KEPT,

01:03:47.414 --> 01:03:48.915
FARNSWORTH
IS HIS OLD SELF AGAIN.

01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:50.417
HIS SPARRING PARTNERS

01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:51.418
ARE KNOCKIN' HIM
AROUND THE RING.

01:03:51.418 --> 01:03:52.919
HE LOST THAT CONFIDENCE
YOU GAVE HIM,

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.921
AND NOW HIS PUNCHES
CAN'T BREAK AN EGG.

01:03:53.921 --> 01:03:54.922
SO?

01:03:54.922 --> 01:03:56.423
SO YOU COME
BACK TO ORLEANS

01:03:56.423 --> 01:03:57.924
AND HYPNOTIZE
FARNSWORTH AGAIN

01:03:57.925 --> 01:04:00.928
3 DAYS BEFORE THE FIGHT
SO THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE

01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:02.429
THAT HE IS BACK
IN WINNING CONDITION

01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:04.431
AND EVERYBODY
WILL WANT TO BET ON HIM.

01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:06.433
ME AND MY BOYS
WILL COVER THOSE BETS.

01:04:06.433 --> 01:04:07.934
THEN ON THE MORNING
OF THE FIGHT,

01:04:07.935 --> 01:04:09.436
YOU WILL DEHYPNOTIZE
FARNSWORTH

01:04:09.436 --> 01:04:10.937
SO WHEN HE CLIMBS
IN THAT RING,

01:04:10.938 --> 01:04:12.940
HE'LL BE HIS OLD,
SCARED SELF AGAIN.

01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:16.943
AFTER THE FIGHT,
WE'LL BE EVEN

01:04:16.944 --> 01:04:18.445
AND YOU'LL
BE FREE TO GO.

01:04:19.947 --> 01:04:21.949
WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST YOU?

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.452
I TRUST YOU.

01:04:25.452 --> 01:04:27.454
ME, TOO.
ME, TOO.

01:04:27.454 --> 01:04:28.455
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

01:04:28.455 --> 01:04:29.956
YOU COMING
BACK TO ORLEANS

01:04:29.957 --> 01:04:30.958
OR YOU GONNA ASK
THE GRAND SUPREME

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:32.459
TO MAKE OUT YOUR
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS?

01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:33.960
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED
GOING TO NEW ORLEANS.

01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.963
I'D--I'D RATHER GO--

01:04:35.963 --> 01:04:36.964
I'D RATHER GO
TO NEW ORLEANS...

01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:38.465
THAN THE CEMETERY.

01:04:46.473 --> 01:04:47.474
MMM.

01:04:47.474 --> 01:04:49.976
MMM.

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:31.352
WELL, WELL, WELL.
MONGO SLADE.

01:05:32.853 --> 01:05:34.354
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

01:05:34.355 --> 01:05:35.856
I WANT TO PLACE
A BET ON THE FIGHT.

01:05:37.858 --> 01:05:39.860
NO KIDDING.

01:05:41.362 --> 01:05:42.863
HOW MUCH OF A BET?

01:05:42.863 --> 01:05:44.865
50,000.

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:50.871
ON WHO?

01:05:56.877 --> 01:06:00.380
BOOTNEY
FARNSWORTH.

01:06:00.381 --> 01:06:02.883
YOU KNOW LIGHTNING DOESN'T
STRIKE THE SAME PLACE TWICE?

01:06:02.883 --> 01:06:04.384
SAYS WHO?

01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:10.391
UH, LOOK.

01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:11.892
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

01:06:11.892 --> 01:06:13.894
I GOTTA DISCUSS
WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:06:13.894 --> 01:06:16.897
BEFORE I CAN OK
A BET OF SUCH MAGNITUDE.

01:06:16.897 --> 01:06:19.900
YOU UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU?

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.402
BROTHER.

01:06:22.403 --> 01:06:24.905
TAKE
YOUR TIME...

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:25.906
BROTHER.

01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:42.423
THE LAST TIME THAT
CHUMP WAS IN HERE,

01:06:42.423 --> 01:06:44.925
HE BURNED US GOOD.

01:06:44.925 --> 01:06:46.426
HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
I CAN FEEL IT!

01:06:46.427 --> 01:06:48.929
YEAH,
ME, TOO, BOSS.

01:06:48.929 --> 01:06:49.930
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STALL HIM

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.431
FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS.

01:06:54.435 --> 01:06:56.937
AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT FARNSWORTH,

01:06:56.937 --> 01:06:57.938
SEE IF
WE CAN GET SOME KIND

01:06:57.938 --> 01:06:59.940
OF LINE ON HIM.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.443
BECAUSE IF THAT GUY
KNOWS SOMETHING,

01:07:03.444 --> 01:07:04.945
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T

01:07:04.945 --> 01:07:05.946
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF IT, RIGHT?

01:07:05.946 --> 01:07:07.447
RIGHT.

01:07:07.448 --> 01:07:10.451
RIGHT. OPEN IT.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:20.460
MONGO, I SUSPECT
WE CAN COVER YOUR BET,

01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:21.962
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF DAYS

01:07:21.962 --> 01:07:23.964
WHILE I GET SOME EXTRA CASH
IN FROM OUT OF TOWN.

01:07:23.964 --> 01:07:24.965
JUST SO LONG
AS YOU'LL COVER ME

01:07:24.965 --> 01:07:26.466
BEFORE FIGHT TIME,
BIGGIE.

01:07:26.467 --> 01:07:28.469
OH, NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:07:28.469 --> 01:07:31.472
IN THAT CASE,
I'LL EASE ON.

01:08:07.007 --> 01:08:08.508
WELL, IF IT AIN'T
SHUFF-ALONG MACK

01:08:08.509 --> 01:08:10.010
AND HIS
OLD-TIME DARKIES.

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:13.513
BIGGIE SMALLS.

01:08:17.017 --> 01:08:19.019
YOUR MAMA STILL WORKING
IN THEM $10 HOUSES?

01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:21.520
SOME OTHER TIME.

01:08:21.522 --> 01:08:23.524
SOME OTHER TIME.

01:08:23.524 --> 01:08:25.024
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GONNA CLIMB

01:08:25.024 --> 01:08:26.026
ALL OVER YOU.

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:30.531
IT'LL TAKE MORE GUTS
THAN YOU'VE GOT, BIGGIE.

01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.032
YOU GOT TO BRING ASS
TO GET ASS.

01:08:32.032 --> 01:08:34.033
YOU'RE COLORFUL,
MACK.

01:08:34.033 --> 01:08:37.537
DUMB, OLD-FASHIONED,
AND OUT OF STYLE,

01:08:37.537 --> 01:08:39.038
BUT COLORFUL.

01:08:39.038 --> 01:08:40.040
BIGGIE, YOU
OUT OF YOUR TERRITORY,

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.542
AND I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO MY TOWN

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.044
WITHOUT
PAYING THEIR RESPECT.

01:08:44.044 --> 01:08:45.545
WELL, WE NO LONGER
CONSIDER THIS TOWN

01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:47.548
AS OUT
OF OUR TERRITORY.

01:08:47.548 --> 01:08:48.549
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, SON.

01:08:48.549 --> 01:08:50.050
IN FACT, I'VE BROUGHT YOU
A MESSAGE FROM THE BOYS

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:51.551
IN KENTUCKY AND ALABAMA.

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:54.054
THEY SAY YOU RUN THIS TOWN
LIKE A SISSY

01:08:54.054 --> 01:08:56.555
AND THEY THINK YOU OUGHT
TO CONSIDER RETIRING.

01:08:56.557 --> 01:08:58.559
WE'RE READY TO TALK A DEAL.

01:08:58.559 --> 01:09:01.562
DEAL? LISTEN,
MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA

01:09:01.562 --> 01:09:02.563
BELONG TO ME
AND MY BOYS,

01:09:02.563 --> 01:09:04.064
AND YOU'LL BE
ONE DEAD SUCKER,

01:09:04.064 --> 01:09:06.066
ALONG WITH ALL THE REST
OF THESE YOUNG COLLEGE CLOWNS,

01:09:06.066 --> 01:09:08.568
IF YOU TRY THAT
EXPANSION STUFF ON US.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:11.071
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE NOWADAYS

01:09:11.071 --> 01:09:12.572
WITH THE GAMBLING
AND SPORTING LIFE

01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:14.575
IN THE BACK BELT.

01:09:14.575 --> 01:09:16.076
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR TWO OF US.

01:09:16.076 --> 01:09:18.078

01:19:23.349 --> 01:19:24.850

WE CAME UP TO SEE

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:50.376
CAME UP AND WE SAID

01:19:50.376 --> 01:19:51.877
WE'D LIKE

01:19:51.878 --> 01:19:53.379
NOW, PEOPLE SAID
YOU CANNOT SEE THE CHAMP

01:19:53.379 --> 01:19:55.381
THE DAY

01:19:55.381 --> 01:19:58.384
SO, MY FRIEND AND I
TOOK IT UPON OURSELVES

01:19:58.384 --> 01:20:00.386
TO COME OUT ON LEDGES
AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS,

01:20:00.386 --> 01:20:02.888
MAINLY BECAUSE

ALABAMA,

01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:06.892
WHICH IS THE CHAMP'S
HOMETOWN ALSO,

01:20:06.893 --> 01:20:09.395
THERE IS AN ORPHANAGE.

01:20:09.395 --> 01:20:13.399
NOW, THIS ORPHANAGE

01:20:26.913 --> 01:20:28.414
POOR CHILD.

01:20:28.414 --> 01:20:30.916
AND HE LOVES THE CHAMP
MORE THAN ANYBODY

01:20:30.917 --> 01:20:33.920
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYONE TO IDENTIFY WITH.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.422
BUT IF YOU SAY
THE CHAMP'S NAME,

01:20:36.422 --> 01:20:38.924
WHY, THEY START ACTING

01:20:38.925 --> 01:20:40.426

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:47.934

01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:11.884

THEY ARE READY

01:47:10.682 --> 01:47:19.190
THAT IN THE PAST YEARS,
THEY HAVE WREAKED HAVOC

01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:22.193

01:47:42.213 --> 01:47:46.217
WHEN THEY HEARD

COMMUNITY
RELATIONS TEAM

01:47:48.219 --> 01:47:50.221

THE RECREATION FUND

01:47:53.224 --> 01:47:55.726
FOR THE LITTLE
SLUM KIDS,

01:47:55.727 --> 01:48:00.732
IT BROUGHT TEARS
TO THEIR EYES.

01:48:00.732 --> 01:48:02.734
THEY SHED TEARS.

THEY CAME RUNNING FORTH,

01:48:10.742 --> 01:48:13.745

OH, HO, HO, WE DON'T

01:48:21.252 --> 01:48:22.753
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:27.258
WHEN THEY RAN IN HERE.

01:48:27.258 --> 01:48:30.261

01:48:30.261 --> 01:48:33.264
THEY WANTED TO HELP.

01:48:33.264 --> 01:48:36.767
