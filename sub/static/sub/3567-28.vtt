00:07.342 --> 00:09.029
Whoa.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.084
Inactive.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.850
Inactive.

00:21.852 --> 00:26.555
- Inactive.
- Do we have to check all of them?

00:26.623 --> 00:31.390
- They're all still inactive, like always.
- We need to make sure.

00:31.595 --> 00:33.996
I've never seen
so many warp pads before!

00:33.997 --> 00:37.383
I hope I have enough of these
crying breakfast friend stickers.

00:37.384 --> 00:41.590
- Where do all these warp pads go, anyway?
- Well, Steven, these

00:41.591 --> 00:43.205
warp pads were used
to travel off-planet.

00:43.273 --> 00:47.376
They were our connection to the
gem home world and to

00:47.444 --> 00:51.262
Gem-controlled planets all
over the universe.

00:51.281 --> 00:54.784
You mean we could go anywhere
we want in outer space?

00:54.785 --> 00:57.793
Yeah, we could do
that if they weren't all busted.

00:57.794 --> 01:00.456
It's true. The galaxy
warps have all been

01:00.524 --> 01:02.272
inactive for thousands of years.

01:02.273 --> 01:04.894
- Can't we fix them?
- No.

01:04.962 --> 01:08.865
It's fine.
I'll always have my memories of

01:08.932 --> 01:13.803
other worlds. But now I'm
here... on Earth... forever.

01:13.871 --> 01:17.673
- With me!
- Right. With you.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.113
It really is incredible
out there, though.

01:22.217 --> 01:25.697
I wish you could see it, Steven.

01:31.589 --> 01:37.426
<i>tay tuned for another
episode of "Crying breakfast friends."</i>

01:37.427 --> 01:38.828
Yeesh. I must be getting old.

01:38.929 --> 01:41.551
- I used to like cartoons.
- Hey, dad, did you

01:41.552 --> 01:44.118
know the gems used to
travel all over outer space?

01:44.153 --> 01:46.802
Yeah.
They're pretty far out, son.

01:46.870 --> 01:51.340
I think Pearl really misses
going out there.

01:51.408 --> 01:55.378
- Dad, can you help me build a spaceship?
- You know, that might be a

01:55.445 --> 01:58.915
little outside my skill set.
How 'bout a bunk bed with wings?

01:58.916 --> 02:01.384
- I could probably do that.
- No way!

02:01.385 --> 02:03.386
We could totally build a spaceship!

02:03.453 --> 02:05.979
People have done it
before, and we're people.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.002
- We are people.
- And Pearl would love

02:09.003 --> 02:13.229
- it so much to see space again.
- Sure. Why not?

02:13.297 --> 02:14.897
How hurt could we get?

02:17.301 --> 02:20.469
My aunt and uncle had a great
love for aviation and each other.

02:20.537 --> 02:22.789
They cherished the years
they spent together,

02:22.790 --> 02:25.041
and they held on to every
belonging they ever owned ...

02:25.108 --> 02:27.393
kind of like me and my storage shed.

02:27.394 --> 02:30.613
I'm starting to think
our family has a problem.

02:30.614 --> 02:33.115
This is great!
I hereby declare this barn to be...

02:33.183 --> 02:39.247
Universe & Universe's
universe of space travel HQ!

02:54.338 --> 02:56.016
Okay. Now.

02:56.068 --> 03:02.329
- "UUU Space Travel"? What is this?
- We built a spaceship!

03:02.364 --> 03:04.428
- A spaceship?
- A spaceship!

03:04.463 --> 03:07.656
A spaceship?

03:09.536 --> 03:12.499
Now, remember, Steven, if
you run in to any trouble out

03:12.500 --> 03:15.899
there, you can always bail.
There's never any shame in bailing.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.309
Fatherly advice understood!
Thank you, dad.

03:19.344 --> 03:22.005
- Light the engines.
- Roger that!

03:25.209 --> 03:29.306
- Next stop ... outer space!
- Blast-off!

03:41.175 --> 03:43.877
No shame!

03:44.737 --> 03:47.921
I think your
calculations may have been off.

03:47.932 --> 03:50.185
Well, they can't be
off if you don't do any.

03:50.484 --> 03:53.561
Did you really
think this was gonna work?

03:53.562 --> 03:54.587
<i>Mnh-mnh-mnh.</i>

03:54.655 --> 03:57.757
Here. Look. You need
smooth, curving surfaces.

03:57.858 --> 04:00.143
Otherwise, you're never gonna get enough

04:00.144 --> 04:02.429
speed to break Earth's
gravitational pull.

04:02.496 --> 04:05.782
Probably swept-back wings for
supersonic flight, airtight

04:05.783 --> 04:09.069
cockpit with ejector seat, and
we'll need some serious engines,

04:09.070 --> 04:12.109
- or maybe rockets would be better.
- I vote rockets!

04:12.144 --> 04:15.542
Whoa, whoa. Hold on a sec.
We're not actually talking about

04:15.609 --> 04:19.079
- building something like this, right?
- What?! This?

04:19.180 --> 04:22.282
Of course not.
That would be ridiculous.

04:22.283 --> 04:25.107
I mean, yes, theoretically,
it's not a stretch.

04:25.142 --> 04:28.421
You've got plenty of spare
parts here, albeit for incredibly

04:28.489 --> 04:31.658
primitive propulsion-based space
travel. The idea is ludicrous.

04:31.759 --> 04:34.678
It would never work,
although several humans,

04:34.679 --> 04:37.597
a monkey, and a dog
did make it into space.

04:37.665 --> 04:41.401
I don't know why I've never
even thought of it before.

04:41.402 --> 04:44.175
- This could actually work!
- Uh...

04:44.510 --> 04:47.326
I hear what you're
saying, and I agree ...

04:47.421 --> 04:49.147
it would be incredibly dangerous,

04:49.148 --> 04:51.736
a full of errant...
this chair is disgusting.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.068
But aren't the true
fools the ones who don't

04:54.069 --> 04:57.630
seize an opportunity, despite
all the inherent risks?

04:57.697 --> 05:00.985
And I'd be able to show Steven
the wonders of the cosmos!

05:01.048 --> 05:03.928
And maybe just for a
second, from a distance,

05:03.977 --> 05:06.932
I could see what's been
going on without me.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.174
All right! Let's do it!

05:09.276 --> 05:12.834
Ooh, space travel!
G-o-o-o-o-o!

05:49.082 --> 05:52.318
Wah-o-o-o-o-o-o-oo!

05:55.589 --> 05:57.497
Ground control to Mach 2.

05:57.498 --> 06:00.359
Come in, Mach 2.
How you doing, buddy?

06:02.172 --> 06:03.329
Wow!

06:03.330 --> 06:05.715
You think we're taking
this a little far?

06:05.716 --> 06:08.100
We're not even close to being done.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.936
- We're not?
- Okay, Steven.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.704
Go ahead and bring her down.

06:17.491 --> 06:20.592
Ugh! Whoo!

06:20.593 --> 06:23.315
Was it supposed to
fall apart like that?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.585
Don't worry. This was
just to test my engine concept.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.389
- I'll work out the kinks in the next one.
- Hang on. Hang on. Next one?!

06:30.457 --> 06:33.384
Is there a shop in town that
carries F-1 single-nozzle

06:33.448 --> 06:36.609
- liquid-fueled rockets?
- You really are serious!

06:36.610 --> 06:39.615
Of course! We're also
going to need a space suit for

06:39.616 --> 06:41.500
Steven so he doesn't freeze or explode.

06:43.224 --> 06:45.706
Whoa.
You are not taking him to space.

06:45.741 --> 06:49.552
- Yes, I am.
- No! I'm not allowing it!

06:49.587 --> 06:52.645
But why? This is why
we founded Universe & Universe!

06:52.712 --> 06:55.216
- Steven, you're grounded.
- What?!

06:55.251 --> 06:58.028
No, no. I mean you're grounded.

06:58.029 --> 07:01.387
- You don't get to leave Earth.
- Oh. What?!

07:01.454 --> 07:05.536
As C.E.O. and supreme space commander,
I hereby ground this astronaut

07:05.576 --> 07:10.496
- and cancel this mission.
- Aw, man! Stupid company by-laws.

07:10.563 --> 07:14.118
- Hey! Who made you C.E.O.?!
- He did.

07:15.248 --> 07:19.071
Fine. If neither of you will help,
I'll just do it by myself ...

07:19.139 --> 07:22.018
- not Like it'll be much different.
- Pearl!

07:23.645 --> 07:28.013
I'm sorry, bud. Sometimes you
just got to know when to bail.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.122
Wha...?

07:37.190 --> 07:40.560
Shh! Want to see
something really cool?

07:40.666 --> 07:44.263
<i>No. Don't give him a banana.</i>

07:44.264 --> 07:46.165
<i>That's what he wants.</i>

07:46.166 --> 07:48.854
Presenting the brand-new

07:48.889 --> 07:53.672
ballistic-flight-capable
universe Mach 3!

07:53.740 --> 07:56.608
Spaceship!

07:56.676 --> 08:00.412
Wait, Steven.
Keep your voice down.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.684
- Whoa! It's even got the logo from the van!
- And if your dad asks,

08:05.752 --> 08:10.804
- we'll say we borrowed it.
- Whoa. Look at all the buttons!

08:10.839 --> 08:14.493
- I must press them all.
- If you want, Steven, we could take

08:14.561 --> 08:18.130
her out for an engine check.
It'll be quick.

08:18.198 --> 08:22.000
Wha?! What the...?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.836
Pea-a-a-a-rl!

08:25.696 --> 08:29.041
Steven, what are you doing?!

08:37.183 --> 08:40.184
Wow! Look!
You can see the temple!

08:40.253 --> 08:42.654
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, can you hear me?!

08:42.655 --> 08:44.873
<i>Where do you two think you're going?!</i>

08:44.874 --> 08:47.092
Hey, dad, guess where I am.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.562
I know where you are! It's where
you're going that concerns me!

08:50.630 --> 08:53.565
Don't worry, dad.
This is just a quick test flight.

08:53.605 --> 08:55.307
This will be perfectly fine ...

08:55.400 --> 08:57.927
just a pop over to the
nearest star system.

08:57.961 --> 09:00.867
- I'll give him back in 50 years.
- 50 years?

09:01.031 --> 09:03.376
<i>What?!
I'll be dead in 50 years!</i>

09:03.377 --> 09:06.178
<i>Pearl, you bring him back
right now, or I'll ...</i>

09:06.246 --> 09:07.702
Hello? Hello?!

09:07.703 --> 09:13.385
- Pearl, I'm not supposed to go. Pearl!
- Oh, this is so exciting!

09:13.453 --> 09:16.021
Steven, you're gonna love it.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.412
Hang on tight!

09:27.467 --> 09:32.965
Mm! What was that?

09:33.840 --> 09:34.915
Pearl!

09:34.916 --> 09:38.143
We can make it.
We're almost there.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.149
- Pearl!
- I'm gonna show it to you.

09:44.217 --> 09:50.355
Uh... Uh...

09:50.423 --> 09:51.813
Steven! What are you doing?!

09:51.814 --> 09:54.593
We need to go, Pearl!
We're not gonna make it!

09:54.694 --> 09:59.298
- But we're almost there!
- Pearl!

09:59.365 --> 10:03.435
I know you miss space,
and I know you worked hard,

10:03.436 --> 10:07.506
but sometimes you just
got to know when to bail.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.239
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

10:18.240 --> 10:21.353
Please, please, please, please, please.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.825
Ohh, this kid's killing me.

10:30.830 --> 10:35.334
- I'm so sorry. I almost got us killed.
- I'm used to it.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.469
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you go to space.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.382
We'll get there someday ...
I promise.

10:40.417 --> 10:45.456
- You know, I think I'd rather be here on Earth.
- With me!

10:45.557 --> 10:48.125
<i>Yeah. With you.</i>
