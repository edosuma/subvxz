00:18.942 --> 00:21.977
My name was Milo Rodricks.

00:22.078 --> 00:24.713
Not that it matters anymore.

00:24.814 --> 00:27.015
I'm...

00:27.116 --> 00:30.886
I <i> was</i> an astrophysicist.

00:30.987 --> 00:34.823
I've lived more than a lifetime,
and...

00:38.127 --> 00:42.464
And I can smell Pop-Tarts.

00:42.565 --> 00:44.967
I'm the last human being

00:45.068 --> 00:48.270
enjoying his last
sensory pleasure.

00:51.674 --> 00:55.177
I got a favor to ask.

00:55.278 --> 00:58.013
Don't forget us.

00:58.114 --> 01:02.851
We may have many faults, but we
don't deserve to be forgotten.

01:13.363 --> 01:15.530
Strike my first statement.

01:15.632 --> 01:19.067
My name <i> is</i> Milo Rodricks

01:19.168 --> 01:22.471
till the very last second,

01:22.572 --> 01:24.239
till the end.

02:26.903 --> 02:28.103
Milo, don't shovel, baby.

02:28.204 --> 02:29.571
They're hot.

02:29.672 --> 02:30.605
I'm booking a pedicure.

02:30.707 --> 02:32.068
Are you good for a pedicure,
honey?

02:32.108 --> 02:35.610
Had mine done last week.

02:35.712 --> 02:38.013
- That the one that exploded?
- Nope.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.881
Good.

02:44.821 --> 02:46.655
Damn it.

02:52.662 --> 02:56.832
Ed, you swore, man.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.873
Diesel, come on.

03:25.194 --> 03:27.396
Diesel!

03:27.497 --> 03:31.033
Ed, hey.

03:31.134 --> 03:34.069
Hey, it's Ricky Stormgren.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.806
I got to ask you, have you
been--you been drinking again?

03:37.907 --> 03:40.575
I think you must have been drunk
when you worked on that thing.

03:42.712 --> 03:44.079
Hello?

03:59.629 --> 04:01.096
Diesel!

04:01.197 --> 04:03.965
Come on.
Come on.

04:05.435 --> 04:06.868
Come on.

04:26.722 --> 04:28.123
- Is your phone...
- No, no.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.791
- You get a signal?
- Hello? Hello?

04:29.892 --> 04:31.560
It just dropped,
all of a sudden.

04:31.661 --> 04:33.562
- Right there, right there.
- There's no way.

04:33.663 --> 04:35.397
- Right there.
- Up there.

04:47.877 --> 04:50.779
- Hurry up.
- Let's get out of here.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.348
Get out of the way!

06:31.314 --> 06:34.516
<i>All military forces</i>
<i>are assembling.</i>

06:34.617 --> 06:38.019
<i>Planes, helicopters,</i>
<i>even model aircraft,</i>

06:38.120 --> 06:40.855
<i>basically anything that is</i>
<i>in the air that is manmade</i>

06:40.957 --> 06:44.626
<i>is being brought down without</i>
<i>damage to person or property.</i>

06:44.727 --> 06:47.062
<i>Communications such as cell</i>
<i>phones are being disrupted.</i>

06:47.163 --> 06:48.863
<i>I'm standing</i>
<i>on the Gianicolo Hill</i>

06:48.965 --> 06:51.633
<i>overlooking the chaos</i>
<i>in the streets of downtown Rome</i>

06:51.734 --> 06:54.603
<i>where the military continue</i>
<i>to assemble in droves.</i>

06:54.704 --> 06:56.404
<i>It's frightening, and it's--</i>

06:56.505 --> 06:59.174
<i>Communications do seem</i>
<i>to be scrambling,</i>

06:59.275 --> 07:01.543
<i>but I would say</i>
<i>that here in the United States,</i>

07:01.644 --> 07:06.047
<i>they've been reported over</i>
<i>New York, Houston, and D.C.</i>

07:06.148 --> 07:09.017
<i>And reports are saying</i>
<i>that at least 40 cities</i>

07:09.118 --> 07:11.853
<i>around the world now have these</i>
<i>vessels hovering over them.</i>

07:11.954 --> 07:14.522
<i>London, okay,</i>
<i>the picture is breaking up,</i>

07:14.624 --> 07:16.625
<i>but you can see a craft there.</i>

07:16.726 --> 07:18.460
They're downing all air traffic.

07:18.561 --> 07:19.995
Aircraft are settling like--

07:20.096 --> 07:22.176
Feathers, we'll say
they're settling like feathers.

07:22.231 --> 07:23.531
All over the world.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.794
No casualties, everything
in the sky has been grounded.

07:25.801 --> 07:26.701
I'll tell you
what they're doing.

07:26.802 --> 07:28.703
They're containing us.

07:28.804 --> 07:32.474
So, Dad, what's our angle?

07:33.776 --> 07:35.310
Siobhan, do we have
a headline picture?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.544
Already up, Hugo.

07:40.182 --> 07:41.416
<i>Still have no idea</i>

07:41.517 --> 07:43.618
<i>what they want</i>
<i>or where they have come from,</i>

07:43.719 --> 07:45.487
<i>as they have made no replies</i>

07:45.588 --> 07:47.255
<i>to any attempts to contact them.</i>

07:47.356 --> 07:49.224
<i>You see,</i>
<i>what we're looking at here</i>

07:49.325 --> 07:51.626
<i>could be perceived as...</i>

07:51.727 --> 07:53.461
<i>This is a national security</i>
<i>matter now,</i>

07:53.562 --> 07:55.096
<i>so everyone looks to me.</i>

07:55.197 --> 07:56.498
No, no, no, no, listen to me.

07:56.599 --> 07:58.066
We do not evac the President.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.001
I want him to remain in the EOC.

08:03.572 --> 08:05.473
What's going on?

08:05.574 --> 08:07.876
Wagons roll, come on.

08:07.977 --> 08:10.178
Joel?

08:10.279 --> 08:13.048
Why can't you drive around him?

08:13.149 --> 08:16.318
- Because he's my son.
- Your son?

08:16.419 --> 08:17.552
I thought your son was dead.

08:17.653 --> 08:20.555
Uncle Paul?

08:20.656 --> 08:22.357
There's no need to be afraid.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.326
My name is Karellen.

08:24.427 --> 08:26.661
I'm the supervisor for Earth.

08:26.762 --> 08:28.363
There's no need to be afraid.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.332
My name is Karellen.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.001
I'm the supervisor for Earth.

08:33.102 --> 08:36.705
I know that this is
frightening and bewildering.

08:36.806 --> 08:39.140
Please try to understand
that we've come a long,

08:39.241 --> 08:41.142
long way to help you.

08:41.243 --> 08:42.277
Annabel?

08:42.378 --> 08:44.379
We've come to help mankind.

08:44.480 --> 08:49.317
War, famine, inequality...

08:49.418 --> 08:51.119
these will be things
of the past.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.421
Suffering will end.

08:53.522 --> 08:56.825
Injustice will end.

08:56.926 --> 09:01.062
No tears,
only happiness and safety.

09:01.163 --> 09:03.665
Your national
and local governments

09:03.766 --> 09:06.101
will still have jurisdiction.

09:06.202 --> 09:09.771
You will run your water
and power.

09:09.872 --> 09:13.007
Your stores will be open.

09:13.109 --> 09:15.944
Your markets will trade.

09:16.045 --> 09:21.082
Your lives will continue
as before minus one thing.

09:21.183 --> 09:23.485
Injustice.

09:23.586 --> 09:26.488
This won't happen overnight,

09:26.589 --> 09:30.024
but the process
is already beginning.

09:30.126 --> 09:35.530
It will herald the arrival
of the golden age of man.

09:35.631 --> 09:37.465
We're not conquerors.

09:37.566 --> 09:40.235
We're enablers.

09:40.336 --> 09:42.270
We're going to help you change.

09:42.371 --> 09:46.674
I know it's frightening,

09:46.776 --> 09:50.845
but you are no longer alone.

09:50.946 --> 09:53.348
I know that this is frightening,

09:53.449 --> 09:56.684
but you are no longer alone.

09:56.786 --> 09:59.587
I know it's frightening,
but you're no longer alone.

09:59.688 --> 10:01.956
We're calling them The Visitors.

10:02.057 --> 10:04.192
No, we're not.

10:11.467 --> 10:14.169
<i>Cellular service</i>
<i>is temporarily unavailable.</i>

10:14.270 --> 10:17.205
<i>Please try your call</i>
<i>again later.</i>

10:24.647 --> 10:26.481
<i>We haven't been able</i>
<i>to bring you this</i>

10:26.582 --> 10:28.650
<i>because we've been having</i>
<i>transmission problems.</i>

10:28.751 --> 10:32.554
<i>The images</i>
<i>of Gaza are staggering.</i>

10:32.655 --> 10:37.659
<i>The wall that separates Israel</i>
<i>from the Gaza Strip,</i>

10:37.760 --> 10:42.030
<i>all 400 miles of it, is gone.</i>

10:42.131 --> 10:45.667
<i>Arab residents are mingling</i>
<i>with Jewish residents.</i>

10:45.768 --> 10:47.769
<i>They didn't actually</i>
<i>resurrect the dead.</i>

10:47.870 --> 10:51.673
<i>They appear to us</i>
<i>as beloved deceased relatives.</i>

10:51.774 --> 10:53.541
<i>Now, that is something--</i>

10:55.010 --> 10:57.479
Ellie, you okay?

10:57.580 --> 10:59.113
Ricky.

10:59.215 --> 11:02.851
<i>I just saw an Israeli soldier</i>
<i>embracing an elderly Arab man</i>

11:02.952 --> 11:05.487
<i>who was weak and stumbling</i>
<i>from the shock of it all.</i>

11:05.588 --> 11:07.388
I mean,
this is just--it's incredible.

11:07.490 --> 11:08.957
<i>I mean, words cannot describe.</i>

11:09.058 --> 11:11.226
<i>This is truly incredible,</i>

11:11.327 --> 11:13.928
<i>emotionally charged scenes</i>
<i>between both Israelis</i>

11:14.029 --> 11:15.396
<i>and Palestinian residents.</i>

11:15.498 --> 11:17.932
<i>I mean, people from both sides</i>
<i>are hugging.</i>

11:18.033 --> 11:19.434
- <i> Some are even weeping.</i>
- Who'd you see?

11:19.535 --> 11:20.575
<i>I just saw an Israeli--</i>

11:20.669 --> 11:22.103
I saw my dad, of course, but,

11:22.204 --> 11:23.505
you know, they missed a trick

11:23.606 --> 11:25.273
because no way he would get
through that many sentences

11:25.374 --> 11:28.476
without throwing in the F-bomb.

11:28.577 --> 11:30.612
You?
Who'd you see?

11:30.713 --> 11:33.948
Yeah, me too, I saw my dad.

11:34.049 --> 11:35.683
<i>But they are not moving,</i>

11:35.784 --> 11:38.486
<i>and they're displaying nothing</i>
<i>that I could say--</i>

11:38.587 --> 11:40.522
It's like the playwright
just walked on stage

11:40.623 --> 11:43.024
and stopped the play.

11:43.125 --> 11:46.261
Remember that little old war
in the Congo no one could stop?

11:46.362 --> 11:49.030
Well, both sides are praying
together under a flying saucer.

11:49.131 --> 11:51.599
Hands-across-the-water
moment, huh?

11:51.700 --> 11:53.801
They're doing something
similar in Sudan.

11:53.903 --> 11:55.570
We hear there's some kind of

11:55.671 --> 11:59.374
conciliatory intervention
between North and South Korea.

11:59.475 --> 12:01.643
Look, we might be able
to get something into the air.

12:01.744 --> 12:03.811
Hmm.

12:03.913 --> 12:06.748
"Blessed are the peacemakers,"
General.

12:06.849 --> 12:08.917
Let's keep it in our pants
for now, hmm?

12:09.018 --> 12:12.887
Everyone was paid a visit
by this avatar.

12:12.988 --> 12:17.191
It calls itself the supervisor
for Earth, Karellen.

12:17.293 --> 12:19.761
How are we spelling that?

12:19.862 --> 12:22.030
With a K?

12:22.131 --> 12:24.599
Every major military conflict
that we know about

12:24.700 --> 12:27.835
across the globe, well,
they've just stopped.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.304
There's some rioting.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.706
Mogadishu went totally wacko,
apparently.

12:31.807 --> 12:33.007
Then they blocked out the sun.

12:33.008 --> 12:35.176
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hold on.

12:35.277 --> 12:37.378
They blocked out the sun?

12:37.479 --> 12:38.580
How?

12:38.681 --> 12:40.815
Localized eclipse?

12:40.916 --> 12:43.518
I don't know.
They're aliens.

12:43.619 --> 12:47.355
It's world peace, all hold hands
and sing "Kumbaya."

12:47.456 --> 12:48.957
Us cynics have to swallow
our pride

12:49.058 --> 12:52.193
and expect pigs
to start flying any day now.

12:52.294 --> 12:54.963
My Uncle Joey kept pigs.

12:55.064 --> 12:58.266
Irish Grazers.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.134
He used to hire a local choirboy

13:00.235 --> 13:03.871
to sing to them as they
were loaded onto the truck,

13:03.973 --> 13:07.809
and these pigs, they loved it.

13:07.910 --> 13:10.411
They were so peaceful

13:10.512 --> 13:12.914
all the way
to the slaughterhouse.

13:23.592 --> 13:24.592
What's up, man?

13:24.693 --> 13:27.729
Okay. I want you
back in the house, Milo.

13:27.830 --> 13:31.466
Come on, Mom, it's fine.

13:31.567 --> 13:33.635
All the planes
can take off again.

13:33.736 --> 13:36.004
We were just grounded
so they could give us a message.

13:36.105 --> 13:38.506
You're smart, baby. What do
you think their weakness is?

13:38.607 --> 13:40.642
You mean like a character flaw?

13:40.743 --> 13:43.111
No, like in "Signs,"
when that little girl

13:43.212 --> 13:44.846
killed them with a glass
of water.

13:44.947 --> 13:48.282
You know, Janey from downstairs
said the Army's everywhere now?

13:48.384 --> 13:50.752
You think they're gonna launch,
like, a--what do we call it,

13:50.853 --> 13:52.253
like, a air strike?

13:52.354 --> 13:54.822
I don't think
they want to hurt us, Mom.

13:54.923 --> 13:57.492
Why come all this way
just to blow us up?

13:57.593 --> 14:00.161
Because they're aliens?

14:14.309 --> 14:16.911
Quiet down now!
Let the Mayor speak!

14:17.012 --> 14:18.346
Can we just...

14:20.516 --> 14:22.350
We're never gonna get anywhere

14:22.451 --> 14:23.751
if we're all hooping it up.

14:23.852 --> 14:25.253
Well, what about food
and water, Mayor?

14:25.354 --> 14:26.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:26.522 --> 14:27.887
Is there gonna be a stockpile
for the town?

14:28.007 --> 14:30.324
There will be no hoarding.

14:30.426 --> 14:31.946
They've only settled
over three cities,

14:31.994 --> 14:33.361
and as far as I can tell,

14:33.462 --> 14:36.264
nothing here in Missouri
has changed.

14:52.715 --> 14:56.584
I guess
they approve of basketball.

14:56.685 --> 15:00.455
Look, we've seen
what they can do.

15:00.556 --> 15:02.690
The question to ask ourselves is

15:02.791 --> 15:05.126
what can we do about them?

15:05.227 --> 15:09.697
As far as I can tell,
not a damn thing.

15:09.798 --> 15:15.002
Ricky, you've been a godsend
to this town,

15:15.104 --> 15:17.271
the way you negotiated
between the community

15:17.372 --> 15:20.041
and the limestone company
last year,

15:20.142 --> 15:22.510
but this is a horse
of a whole different color.

15:22.611 --> 15:25.847
Yeah, exactly,
which is why I ask,

15:25.948 --> 15:28.516
why are we even trying
to guess what they're up to?

15:28.617 --> 15:30.151
So what's your grand plan?

15:30.252 --> 15:31.686
I say we sit tight.

15:31.787 --> 15:33.488
I mean, they haven't
zapped the head off

15:33.589 --> 15:34.722
the Statue of Liberty yet.

15:34.823 --> 15:36.090
In fact, they've actually made
an effort

15:36.191 --> 15:37.312
to make us feel comfortable,

15:37.326 --> 15:42.363
so if this is an invasion...

15:42.464 --> 15:46.467
I gotta say,
it's an awfully considerate one.

15:49.037 --> 15:50.538
They need you all over again.

15:50.639 --> 15:51.773
I don't know about that.

15:51.874 --> 15:55.376
They're probably
all sick of me by now.

15:55.477 --> 15:58.613
You never understood
the effect you have on people.

15:58.714 --> 16:00.848
It's very rare.

16:08.290 --> 16:11.125
Ready to head up to bed?

16:11.226 --> 16:12.894
We can pretend to sleep.

16:16.698 --> 16:21.335
When that alien, Karellen...

16:21.436 --> 16:23.204
when he spoke to you
as your dad--

16:36.985 --> 16:40.154
<i>♪ Yeah, let's twist again ♪</i>

16:40.255 --> 16:43.257
<i>♪ Like we did last year ♪</i>

16:43.358 --> 16:45.927
<i>♪ Do you remember when ♪</i>

16:46.028 --> 16:48.529
<i>♪ Things were really humming ♪</i>

16:48.630 --> 16:51.833
<i>♪ Yeah, let's twist again ♪</i>

16:51.934 --> 16:54.602
Els, you're not Annie Oakley.

16:54.703 --> 16:56.504
You're from Greenwich Village.

16:59.408 --> 17:00.641
Let's go. Let's go!

17:00.742 --> 17:02.142
Come on, quick!
Get in the basement!

17:09.885 --> 17:11.652
Diesel.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.759
Okay.

18:29.549 --> 18:31.899
You've got my attention.

18:38.507 --> 18:41.275
Ah! All right!
All right, hey!

18:43.578 --> 18:45.346
Ricky?

18:45.447 --> 18:48.416
Ellie, stay down there.

19:13.475 --> 19:16.010
Son of a...

19:48.877 --> 19:51.312
All right.

19:51.413 --> 19:56.050
If I go, leave my family alone.

20:19.708 --> 20:22.810
This is ridiculous.

21:03.186 --> 21:04.620
Heads up!

21:04.721 --> 21:06.455
You let no one through,
you hear me?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.240
No one.

21:13.363 --> 21:14.296
Hold the line!

21:14.397 --> 21:15.664
Stay back.

21:18.201 --> 21:19.134
Get back!

22:09.087 --> 22:11.888
<i>Do you like it?</i>

22:11.989 --> 22:15.459
<i>It's the honeymoon suite.</i>

22:15.560 --> 22:18.295
The Four Seasons Hotel.

22:18.396 --> 22:21.565
New York City.

22:24.302 --> 22:27.537
Annabel and I didn't
leave this room for three days,

22:27.638 --> 22:30.540
even though I had tickets
to the playoffs.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.509
<i>Hmm.</i>

22:32.610 --> 22:37.447
<i>Yankees beat Minnesota Twins</i>
<i>three games to one.</i>

22:40.685 --> 22:42.786
What the hell is going on?

22:42.887 --> 22:45.989
<i>There's no need to be afraid.</i>

22:46.090 --> 22:49.159
<i>My name is Karellen.</i>

22:52.296 --> 22:54.231
Why are you here?

22:54.332 --> 22:56.733
<i>You were on the verge</i>
<i>of discovering</i>

22:56.834 --> 22:58.568
<i>interstellar travel,</i>

22:58.669 --> 23:03.140
<i>but the stars are not for man,</i>
<i>Ricky.</i>

23:03.241 --> 23:07.611
<i>We need a messenger</i>
<i>they can trust,</i>

23:07.712 --> 23:11.581
<i>a conduit between the Overlords</i>
<i>and Earth.</i>

23:11.682 --> 23:13.817
<i>Mm, Overlords.</i>

23:13.918 --> 23:18.021
<i>I find that term</i>
<i>a little bombastic, but hey-ho.</i>

23:22.693 --> 23:25.162
Why did you make this room?

23:25.263 --> 23:29.599
Why'd you send me Annabel?

23:29.700 --> 23:33.403
<i>Because she is still the most</i>
<i>important thing in your life.</i>

23:36.674 --> 23:41.545
No, I got a new life.

23:41.646 --> 23:43.013
I'm getting married again.

23:43.114 --> 23:47.150
All of this, this is--

23:47.251 --> 23:49.085
This is mind games.

23:49.187 --> 23:53.757
Look, you scare the hell out of
us, and you knock my door down,

23:53.858 --> 23:59.463
and then you ask me
to be your ambassador.

23:59.564 --> 24:02.199
Buddy, you're not even
in the right zip code.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.167
I mean, you need--
you need the President,

24:04.268 --> 24:07.504
the Pope,
the Dalai Lama, somebody.

24:07.605 --> 24:09.406
<i>Problem is,</i><i>they have baggage.</i>

24:09.507 --> 24:10.540
<i>You don't.</i>

24:10.641 --> 24:13.009
<i>You are hardworking,</i>

24:13.110 --> 24:16.112
<i>brave, kind.</i>

24:18.382 --> 24:22.219
Why did you make this room?

24:22.320 --> 24:25.455
<i>You're prepared</i>
<i>to change and adapt.</i>

24:25.556 --> 24:27.524
Okay, take me home.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.759
Take me ho--where's--
where's the thing?

24:29.861 --> 24:31.661
<i>People trust you.</i>

24:31.762 --> 24:33.029
<i>You look them in the eye and--</i>

24:33.130 --> 24:36.132
Hey, if you want someone
to push your agenda,

24:36.234 --> 24:37.267
then you go down there,

24:37.368 --> 24:40.103
and by all means,
do it yourself.

24:42.073 --> 24:45.442
<i>When the limestone mine</i>
<i>wanted to take over your town,</i>

24:45.543 --> 24:49.012
<i>you brought both sides together.</i>

24:49.113 --> 24:50.347
<i>You built bridges.</i>

24:50.448 --> 24:53.984
<i>You healed divides.</i>

24:54.085 --> 24:55.452
<i>They called you--</i>

24:55.553 --> 24:57.053
They called me "The Pacifier."

24:57.154 --> 25:00.090
It was... it was meant
to be a joke.

25:00.191 --> 25:01.424
<i>Mm, I know.</i>

25:01.526 --> 25:03.927
<i>I've studied</i>
<i>all human languages, syntax,</i>

25:04.028 --> 25:06.763
<i>colloquialisms, jokes.</i>

25:06.864 --> 25:10.867
<i>I get it.</i>

25:10.968 --> 25:13.870
<i>7 billion people,</i>

25:13.971 --> 25:17.841
<i>and I chose you.</i>

25:17.942 --> 25:20.544
<i>It was between you</i>

25:20.645 --> 25:25.549
<i>and an 82-year-old blind woman</i>
<i>from Seoul.</i>

25:32.957 --> 25:35.792
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

25:35.893 --> 25:38.361
I'm thinking I want to see
who I'm talking to.

25:38.462 --> 25:42.065
<i>I have to stay where I am.</i>

25:42.166 --> 25:46.169
<i>There's a lot to tell people.</i>

25:46.270 --> 25:47.237
<i>Look beside you.</i>

25:53.210 --> 25:55.312
What is it?

25:55.413 --> 25:57.647
<i>It's a gift.</i>

26:01.752 --> 26:03.320
What if I don't want to take it?

26:03.421 --> 26:05.622
<i>Well, then don't take it.</i>

26:09.660 --> 26:12.462
<i>I hope you can trust me.</i>

26:18.903 --> 26:21.738
I might take it and just chuck
this thing in the river.

26:21.839 --> 26:26.076
<i>If that's what you want</i>
<i>to do, then of course,</i>

26:26.177 --> 26:30.313
<i>I respect your decision.</i>

26:30.414 --> 26:35.251
<i>I believe you will make</i>
<i>the right choice,</i>

26:35.353 --> 26:38.321
<i>whatever that choice may be.</i>

26:38.422 --> 26:39.582
I don't know about you, Paul,

26:39.657 --> 26:41.558
but these guys
don't give me the warm fuzzies.

26:41.659 --> 26:43.220
They're neutralizing
the world's armies,

26:43.294 --> 26:45.161
and everybody's looking to us
to make the first move.

26:45.262 --> 26:47.397
The President wants to strike,
Paul.

26:47.498 --> 26:48.732
Yeah, what's the point?

26:48.833 --> 26:51.601
We'd be ants firing
wood-pulp pellets at a B-52.

26:51.702 --> 26:52.902
The President thinks
that we could--

26:53.004 --> 26:54.704
They brought dead people back.

26:54.805 --> 26:57.040
They stopped the world, General.

26:57.141 --> 27:01.144
As far as I'm concerned, that
puts them in the pilot's seat.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.245
We need you here, Paul.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.647
I just heard six hours ago

27:03.748 --> 27:05.849
they kidnapped a farmer
named Richard Stormgren.

27:05.950 --> 27:08.385
Jeez.

27:08.486 --> 27:11.655
What do we tell the old man?

27:11.756 --> 27:13.623
Tell him I'm going to Missouri.

27:22.299 --> 27:24.100
Ran outside and approached
to see what it was,

27:24.135 --> 27:25.835
- and that's when we saw it.
- Yeah, good on you.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.438
<i>The pod thing, it was over</i>
<i>the mountains over that way.</i>

27:28.539 --> 27:30.974
Alien abduction.

27:31.075 --> 27:33.155
<i>We thought it was gonna crash</i>
<i>right into their house.</i>

27:33.177 --> 27:36.312
The Overlords talk
about peace, harmony, justice.

27:36.414 --> 27:40.483
Then they smash a fella's house
in and carry him away.

27:40.584 --> 27:44.087
Well, people need
to know the facts.

27:44.188 --> 27:46.990
Then they can make up
their own minds.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.084
Still here waiting for--

28:14.185 --> 28:16.986
There it is!

28:17.088 --> 28:18.188
Right there?

28:42.079 --> 28:43.379
Ellie?

29:11.909 --> 29:14.511
Hey, babe.

29:26.490 --> 29:28.291
Are you okay?

29:28.392 --> 29:31.861
I talked with him...
with Karellen.

29:31.962 --> 29:34.397
What--what did he say?

29:34.498 --> 29:36.699
What--what did he look like?

29:36.801 --> 29:37.967
I don't know.
I didn't--

29:38.068 --> 29:38.968
I didn't see him face-to-face.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.337
He gave me this.

29:41.438 --> 29:42.806
What is it?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.207
I have no idea.

29:58.689 --> 30:01.991
Mr. Stormgren.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.293
Can I see you for a minute?

30:05.830 --> 30:07.797
Stay back!

30:12.236 --> 30:15.505
For your own safety, move back!

30:32.990 --> 30:34.324
So what can I do for you?

30:34.425 --> 30:36.893
I've been reading all
about you on the flight over.

30:36.994 --> 30:39.229
You're a smart man,
Mr. Stormgren,

30:39.330 --> 30:40.763
a progressive man, humanitarian.

30:40.865 --> 30:41.998
You better be careful,
you're gonna have me

30:42.099 --> 30:43.132
blushing there, Mister--

30:43.234 --> 30:45.668
Danlow, Paul Danlow.

30:45.769 --> 30:46.936
I work for the
U.S. Secret Service.

30:47.037 --> 30:50.173
I can figure out
who you work for, Mr. Danlow.

30:50.274 --> 30:52.442
What you got there?

30:54.411 --> 30:57.347
I have absolutely no idea.

30:57.448 --> 31:00.850
They give you that?

31:00.951 --> 31:03.887
Can I take a look-see?

31:06.156 --> 31:07.323
You really should give
that to me,

31:07.424 --> 31:11.728
and I can take it somewhere,
somewhere safe.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.863
I'm sure you could.

31:13.964 --> 31:16.466
You're not gonna open it,
are you?

31:16.567 --> 31:19.102
It'd be one hell of a move with
the Earth at stake and whatnot.

31:19.203 --> 31:20.536
Look, I understand.

31:20.638 --> 31:23.640
The aliens gave you something,
and that makes you feel special.

31:23.741 --> 31:25.675
Okay, no, no, don't do that.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.543
- Don't patronize me.
- Oh, I'm not.

31:27.645 --> 31:30.647
They must take you seriously,
so I take you seriously.

31:30.748 --> 31:32.448
That's why I'm asking you
to hand it over

31:32.549 --> 31:33.583
of your own free will.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.552
Uh-huh, with a gun?

31:36.654 --> 31:40.290
Okay, what if it's a bomb
or a virus?

31:40.391 --> 31:41.658
You think of that?

31:41.759 --> 31:43.993
Of course I thought about that,

31:44.094 --> 31:45.795
but don't you think that
if that was their intention,

31:45.896 --> 31:47.864
they could have
done it themselves at any point?

31:47.965 --> 31:48.898
Well, think about it, Ricky.

31:48.999 --> 31:50.333
So far these aliens have been

31:50.434 --> 31:53.670
overwhelmingly demonstrative
and secretive, threatening.

31:53.771 --> 31:57.407
They smashed open your home,
forced you onto their ship.

31:57.508 --> 31:59.142
Then they give you this thing
and they tell you to open it?

31:59.243 --> 32:01.878
Actually, Karellen told me I
could do what I wanted with it.

32:01.979 --> 32:03.880
Okay?
He gave me a choice.

32:03.981 --> 32:05.515
You're not.

32:05.616 --> 32:06.883
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

32:06.984 --> 32:09.085
What are you do--whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

32:09.186 --> 32:13.756
Just recording you
on our property threatening us.

32:13.857 --> 32:15.418
All right, all right,
hey, look, look.

32:15.492 --> 32:16.859
I've seen
what these guys can do.

32:16.961 --> 32:19.028
I'm pretty sure they
can stop you from shooting us.

32:19.129 --> 32:21.864
Yeah?
Maybe they can't.

32:21.966 --> 32:25.401
Maybe they'll just
find another farmer.

32:25.502 --> 32:28.204
Actually, the backup
was an old lady in Seoul.

32:28.305 --> 32:31.107
Hell, cards on the table,
Ricky, you're a decent man,

32:31.208 --> 32:32.742
and decent men
can be manipulated.

32:32.843 --> 32:33.843
Hey, look,
he said that they're here

32:33.944 --> 32:35.912
to teach us, all right?

32:36.013 --> 32:36.913
To help us.

32:37.014 --> 32:39.015
He said, "Hey-ho."

32:39.116 --> 32:40.016
They're evil aliens,

32:40.117 --> 32:42.085
but their leader says, "Hey-ho"?

32:42.186 --> 32:43.086
No.

32:43.187 --> 32:44.821
You know what I think?

32:44.922 --> 32:46.789
I think you want to know
what's in this thing

32:46.890 --> 32:48.391
just as much as I do.

32:48.492 --> 32:51.294
Whoa.
Final warning, hand it over,

32:51.395 --> 32:53.763
or I will put you down.

32:59.169 --> 33:01.471
Okay.

33:27.163 --> 33:29.680
There's intel from
hospitals as far away as China.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.767
Same story everywhere.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.879
We're looking at a 60% recovery

33:34.947 --> 33:37.715
in patients presenting with
leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma,

33:37.783 --> 33:41.419
pulmonary lung disease.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.823
The first cure occurred the same
minute that you opened the vial.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.591
Maybe they are gonna
cure everything.

33:46.659 --> 33:49.828
You tell me.
They're your friends.

34:20.391 --> 34:25.530
Ricky, you're the sole
spokesperson for an alien race.

34:25.598 --> 34:27.632
Have fun with it.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.983
- You got it?
- Yeah.

34:45.050 --> 34:49.320
Morning.
Uh...

34:49.388 --> 34:51.856
My name is, uh,
is Richard Stormgren.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.229
Um, I have been chosen
to be the...

34:58.297 --> 35:03.268
the intermediary
between the Overlords and, uh,

35:03.335 --> 35:06.704
us, Earth.

35:06.772 --> 35:11.009
<i>And trust me, this was all</i>

35:11.076 --> 35:14.746
<i>one giant "Twilight Zone"</i>
<i>to me too, so...</i>

35:22.788 --> 35:27.992
Uh, I was taken up
to meet with him...

35:28.060 --> 35:29.093
uh, Karellen,

35:29.161 --> 35:32.864
and I was not permitted
to see him...

35:32.932 --> 35:35.366
<i>physically,</i>

35:35.434 --> 35:38.002
uh, although I could tell that,
in speaking to him,

35:38.070 --> 35:41.973
he seemed to be compassionate.

35:42.041 --> 35:47.745
I will be taken up to meet
with him at regular intervals

35:47.813 --> 35:52.884
and will be passing on...

35:52.952 --> 35:57.755
uh, passing on information.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.591
Uh...

35:59.658 --> 36:03.828
<i>Karellen wants you to know</i>
<i>that any war anywhere</i>

36:03.896 --> 36:07.932
<i>will be seen</i>
<i>and will be firmly stopped.</i>

36:08.000 --> 36:12.570
Chemical pollution
of the atmosphere will be, uh...

36:15.040 --> 36:17.108
Yeah, they're gon--
they're gonna deal with that.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.376
They're going to deal with it?

36:18.410 --> 36:22.013
Yeah, pretty sure about that.

36:22.081 --> 36:26.317
The environment,
uh, social issues, politics,

36:26.385 --> 36:27.752
I'm told that that's gonna

36:27.820 --> 36:31.990
be more of a gradual process
of development--

36:32.057 --> 36:33.391
Mr. Stormgren,

36:33.459 --> 36:35.994
just tell us, why won't Karellen
show us his face?

36:36.061 --> 36:38.463
I...don't know.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.570
- Can they stop death?
- I-I can't--I can't--

36:45.638 --> 36:47.718
Well, what does the inside
of their ship look like?

36:47.740 --> 36:49.140
Come on, tell us something.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.608
<i>What, you want to know</i>
<i>what it looks like?</i>

36:50.676 --> 36:54.012
<i>It looked like a hotel suite,</i>

36:54.079 --> 36:57.348
<i>Four Seasons Hotel in New York.</i>

36:57.416 --> 37:00.518
Well, Mr. Stormgren, hey,
you must know some--

37:11.697 --> 37:14.799
One of their pods just
landed on the White House lawn.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.708
That'll be for me.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.445
Which way?

37:27.513 --> 37:29.247
Don't worry about it.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.082
We'll get you up to speed.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.657
You know,
it's only gonna get worse.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.726
Half the world thinks
that you're their salvation.

37:41.794 --> 37:43.961
The other half wants to blow you
out of the sky.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.630
<i>Well, you've had</i>
<i>that relationship</i>

37:45.698 --> 37:47.965
<i>with your religions</i>
<i>for long enough.</i>

37:48.033 --> 37:49.367
Mm-hmm.

37:49.435 --> 37:54.005
<i>Fear, disorientation, and anger</i>

37:54.073 --> 37:58.376
<i>is part of the first stage.</i>

37:58.444 --> 37:59.844
"Are."

37:59.912 --> 38:01.813
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

38:01.880 --> 38:05.817
They--they <i>are</i> part
of the first stage.

38:05.884 --> 38:10.088
<i>Second person singular</i>
<i>present active imperative.</i>

38:10.155 --> 38:12.457
<i>My bad.</i>

38:19.164 --> 38:21.699
You've cleaned up.

38:21.767 --> 38:27.338
<i>We are not as demonstrative</i>
<i>as you might think.</i>

38:27.406 --> 38:30.508
<i>We want to help you</i>
<i>help yourselves.</i>

38:30.576 --> 38:33.010
Yeah, but a lot of people
are gonna find that

38:33.078 --> 38:35.646
awfully condescending.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.316
<i>Tell me,</i><i>is it condescending</i>

38:38.384 --> 38:42.653
<i>to send your children to school?</i>

38:42.721 --> 38:46.157
That's a good point,
but here's the thing.

38:46.225 --> 38:49.694
If you walk around
calling us all children,

38:49.762 --> 38:52.697
you're gonna piss a lot
of people off.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.065
<i>My bad.</i>

39:16.755 --> 39:21.225
If you, um...

39:21.293 --> 39:25.463
if you'd have come here
five years ago...

39:25.531 --> 39:28.566
Annabel still be alive?

39:28.634 --> 39:32.904
<i>We weren't here five years</i>
<i>ago, and she died.</i>

39:32.971 --> 39:34.672
Mm-hmm.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.910
<i>If you'd like,</i>
<i>I will dismantle this room.</i>

39:38.977 --> 39:42.280
No, no, we'll...

39:42.347 --> 39:45.383
let's keep the room for now.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.652
<i>Of course.</i>

39:53.358 --> 39:54.826
Ricky! Ricky!

39:54.893 --> 39:57.228
- Ricky! Ricky!
- Ricky! Ricky!

40:01.033 --> 40:02.900
Diesel.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.302
Come on.

40:04.369 --> 40:07.839
Come on, up.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.841
Come here.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.547
This is gonna
change everything for us, Ricky.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.516
Look, I'm sorry, Els, all right?

40:18.584 --> 40:21.819
Just give me...

40:21.887 --> 40:25.122
give me a couple weeks
so I can wrap my head around

40:25.190 --> 40:29.260
what happens next.

40:29.328 --> 40:31.562
It was Annabel.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.866
They sent you Annabel,
didn't they?

40:38.971 --> 40:42.106
Four Seasons honeymoon suite?

40:47.079 --> 40:49.280
And every time
you go back to that ship,

40:49.348 --> 40:51.782
it's to that hotel room.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.668
I'm here.

41:10.736 --> 41:15.306
Whatever you go through...

41:15.374 --> 41:18.009
just know I love you.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.249
<i>A stonewashed hick</i>
<i>from a flyover state.</i>

41:25.317 --> 41:27.084
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>they picked this guy?</i>

41:27.152 --> 41:30.454
<i>Because he doesn't ask the</i>
<i>right questions, that's why.</i>

41:30.522 --> 41:33.691
What if they're playing
the long game?

41:35.761 --> 41:39.664
They can live for thousands
of years,

41:39.731 --> 41:43.000
so they can wait, you know?

41:43.068 --> 41:48.272
Make us healthy,
make us sleepy, make us fat.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.509
They want to buy the world
a Coke.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.245
All lovey-dovey.

41:54.313 --> 41:58.149
Oh, you can dress this up

41:58.216 --> 42:03.120
in as much hippie-dippie crap
as you like.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.156
This is an invasion.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.502
No disrespect, sir,

42:13.622 --> 42:16.701
but what the hell
can you do about it?

42:27.424 --> 42:28.591
<i>On my daddy's farm,</i>

42:28.692 --> 42:31.260
<i>the animals</i>
<i>have all the food they want.</i>

42:31.361 --> 42:33.996
<i>I feed the pigs red apples.</i>

42:34.097 --> 42:37.633
<i>And daddy gives them medicine</i>
<i>so they never get sick,</i>

42:37.734 --> 42:39.702
<i>and they're happy</i>
<i>when daddy and the other men</i>

42:39.803 --> 42:41.337
<i>take them away.</i>

42:41.438 --> 42:42.772
<i>I don't know where they go,</i>

42:42.873 --> 42:46.942
<i>but I know they're really happy.</i>

42:47.044 --> 42:50.813
<i>Paid for by the Freedom League.</i>

42:55.419 --> 42:57.553
<i>Their reaction</i>
<i>is understandable.</i>

42:57.654 --> 43:01.090
<i>It means we're making</i>
<i>an impression.</i>

43:01.191 --> 43:04.627
<i>Now, there is plenty of food</i>
<i>and shelter on this world.</i>

43:04.728 --> 43:06.829
<i>It's a question of distribution.</i>

43:06.930 --> 43:08.964
<i>Put the right people together.</i>

43:09.066 --> 43:11.801
<i>They will come</i>
<i>because you ask them to.</i>

43:11.902 --> 43:13.969
And then what?

43:14.071 --> 43:16.505
I don't even own a suit.

43:16.606 --> 43:18.174
I don't know what you think
I'm gonna accomplish

43:18.275 --> 43:21.477
that generations
of diplomacy hasn't.

43:21.578 --> 43:23.512
<i>The politicians have failed.</i>

43:23.613 --> 43:25.081
<i>Be yourself, Ricky.</i>

43:25.182 --> 43:26.949
<i>Don't think like them.</i>

43:27.050 --> 43:29.118
Look, Karellen.

43:29.219 --> 43:32.788
<i>Hmm.</i>

43:32.889 --> 43:38.260
I think it would go a hell
of a long way with people

43:38.362 --> 43:40.896
if you would just,
you know, show yourself.

43:40.997 --> 43:44.834
<i>You wouldn't accept</i>
<i>my appearance.</i>

43:44.935 --> 43:48.337
So, hiding out here,

43:48.438 --> 43:51.474
you plan to stop centuries
of people hurting one another?

43:51.575 --> 43:55.244
<i>But you are already feeling</i>
<i>each other's pain.</i>

43:55.345 --> 43:57.980
<i>You share the same fears</i>
<i>and confusions</i>

43:58.081 --> 44:00.516
<i>about us and about your future.</i>

44:00.617 --> 44:04.153
<i>It's a healthy beginning.</i>

44:04.254 --> 44:05.621
So the Overlords have actually

44:05.722 --> 44:07.289
sealed up
the Saudi oil reserves.

44:07.391 --> 44:08.824
Uh, why?

44:08.925 --> 44:11.961
<i>Well, I think that we're</i>
<i>hoping it'll be taken</i>

44:12.062 --> 44:14.663
as an invitation
to come talk with us.

44:14.765 --> 44:18.200
- Mr. Stormgren?
- Mm-hmm?

44:18.301 --> 44:23.606
I can show you a petition
sponsored by the Freedom League,

44:23.707 --> 44:28.644
22,400,000 people
who want the Overlords

44:28.745 --> 44:33.382
to get the hell
off our property.

44:33.483 --> 44:35.951
Next time you cozy up
to your pal in the sky,

44:36.052 --> 44:37.420
you tell him that.

44:37.521 --> 44:39.655
Let's look at what's happening.

44:39.756 --> 44:42.391
I never thought
that I would see world peace.

44:42.492 --> 44:45.027
Did you?

44:45.128 --> 44:46.829
No?

44:46.930 --> 44:49.398
We've ended war,

44:49.499 --> 44:52.101
and now it's time
to end starvation.

44:52.202 --> 44:55.337
Every day, millions of people
are starving

44:55.439 --> 44:58.774
while the rest of us just
throw away unwanted food,

44:58.875 --> 45:01.977
so we need to find a way
to get that surplus

45:02.078 --> 45:05.548
into the hands
of the poorest people.

45:05.649 --> 45:06.682
There we go.

45:06.783 --> 45:10.453
So we don't need a Navy anymore,
right?

45:10.554 --> 45:12.922
It just so happens we happen
to have a lot of big ships

45:13.023 --> 45:14.943
just sitting around
doing a whole lot of nothing,

45:15.025 --> 45:18.127
so we're gonna refrigerate
the U.S. Fleet and use that

45:18.228 --> 45:20.896
to transport the food supplies
across the Atlantic

45:20.997 --> 45:22.731
to West Africa.

45:22.833 --> 45:24.073
We're just gonna empty them out

45:24.134 --> 45:26.502
and then fill them up
with dinner.

45:26.603 --> 45:28.270
Impressive.

45:28.371 --> 45:30.773
No, it really is.

45:30.874 --> 45:32.608
I mean,

45:32.709 --> 45:37.413
it leaves our nation
completely open to attack,

45:37.514 --> 45:42.284
but I'm glad Africa
will get her meals on wheels.

45:44.621 --> 45:47.122
The Overlords have imprisoned
our oil reserves.

45:47.224 --> 45:49.658
Actually,
they freed your supply lines.

45:49.759 --> 45:52.294
These pipes pumped your oil.

45:52.395 --> 45:55.030
Now we're gonna use them
to pump desalinated water

45:55.131 --> 45:56.465
into the Sub-Sahara.

45:56.566 --> 45:58.801
You cannot just commandeer the
property of the Saudi Kingdom.

45:58.902 --> 46:01.704
These people are dying
of starvation and thirst.

46:01.805 --> 46:04.206
Now, we need to irrigate
half a continent, sir,

46:04.307 --> 46:06.542
and our think tank
says that's the best way.

46:08.912 --> 46:10.846
Oh, I am so sorry.

46:10.947 --> 46:12.748
You guys got to be
dying of thirst too.

46:12.849 --> 46:14.316
Can I get you something
to drink?

46:14.417 --> 46:17.319
Hey, can we get these guys
something to drink, please?

46:17.420 --> 46:20.422
Yes, why has there been
no water on the table?

46:38.108 --> 46:42.678
Gentlemen, cheers.

46:54.391 --> 46:56.659
Dirty Texan muck, hmm?

47:00.196 --> 47:04.300
Very well, but understand
that this is not the wish

47:04.401 --> 47:06.569
of our kingdom.

47:06.670 --> 47:11.206
We have always been
in this together.

47:11.308 --> 47:13.819
Now it's time
to start acting like it.

47:16.246 --> 47:20.469
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Golden Age of Man.

48:18.299 --> 48:21.577
<i>Yes, of course, when they</i>
<i>first arrived, I was scared.</i>

48:21.678 --> 48:24.279
<i>Everybody was scared.</i>

48:24.381 --> 48:28.684
<i>We watched them</i>
<i>like we were shop mannequins,</i>

48:28.785 --> 48:30.686
<i>but after the shock,</i>

48:30.787 --> 48:35.157
<i>we realized that we had been</i>
<i>living in so much uncertainty.</i>

48:35.258 --> 48:37.192
<i>They had come to rule us,</i>

48:37.293 --> 48:40.229
<i>and you can argue the morality,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

48:40.330 --> 48:43.932
<i>but they brought certainty</i>
<i>and stability.</i>

48:44.034 --> 48:46.769
<i>At least that's</i>
<i>how it seemed to us at first.</i>

48:46.870 --> 48:48.971
<i>I look back now and shudder.</i>

48:49.072 --> 48:51.540
<i>We were all under a spell.</i>

48:55.111 --> 48:57.479
<i>Paid for by the Freedom League.</i>

49:11.757 --> 49:13.170
That's some fancy schooling.

49:13.290 --> 49:15.126
He gets a scholarship.

49:15.227 --> 49:16.747
He wrote this essay
about the Overlords

49:16.762 --> 49:19.564
and sent it to some
fancy college in Massachusetts.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.199
Oh, yeah? Like what?
What's in it?

49:21.300 --> 49:23.568
My son has theories.

49:23.669 --> 49:26.104
Never known the neighborhood
to look so nice.

49:26.205 --> 49:30.008
They still can't take away
the U.S. of A.

49:30.109 --> 49:31.609
Got to have independence.

49:31.711 --> 49:35.380
Fourth of July, yo.

49:35.481 --> 49:36.982
Hi, honey.
How was school?

49:45.825 --> 49:49.995
There was a cocaine plant
in Ecuador.

49:50.096 --> 49:53.064
The Overlords split it up
into its component parts,

49:53.165 --> 49:56.468
about 4 million pieces.

49:56.569 --> 49:58.870
What they do is like magic, huh?

49:58.971 --> 50:01.106
They've learned
how to manipulate solids

50:01.207 --> 50:03.308
at a molecular level,

50:03.409 --> 50:06.878
probably using
a controlled magnetic field.

50:06.979 --> 50:08.580
It's not magic, Mom.

50:08.681 --> 50:10.882
It's just a 30,000-year
head start.

50:10.983 --> 50:12.450
Your mind, honey.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.053
It just blossomed
when they arrived, didn't it?

50:15.154 --> 50:18.023
What you gonna do
with all that know-how, huh?

50:18.124 --> 50:19.758
I don't know.

50:19.859 --> 50:22.327
I can't do much with it.

50:29.301 --> 50:31.169
Keep dreaming.

50:31.270 --> 50:35.507
Supper's on the table.

50:43.182 --> 50:46.818
The Freedom League's
gaining momentum,

50:46.919 --> 50:48.753
funded by people
like Hugo Wainwright.

50:48.854 --> 50:50.789
Doesn't that bother you?

50:50.890 --> 50:54.759
<i>I had hoped the world had</i>
<i>had enough of angry mobs.</i>

50:57.063 --> 50:59.230
The Saudis are pushing back
on this whole thing,

50:59.331 --> 51:02.067
and I can't blame 'em.

51:02.168 --> 51:04.636
People get angry
when they feel impotent.

51:04.737 --> 51:07.739
<i>But I've enabled you all</i>
<i>to help yourselves.</i>

51:07.840 --> 51:10.108
But, see,
this is what I'm talking about.

51:10.209 --> 51:13.978
While you're standing back there
hiding your face...

51:14.080 --> 51:16.114
I mean, look at this.
Have you seen these?

51:21.187 --> 51:25.690
<i>I don't mind the centipede.</i>

51:25.791 --> 51:27.725
<i>I'm not wild</i>
<i>about being portrayed</i>

51:27.827 --> 51:31.229
<i>as a blue robot, though.</i>

51:44.043 --> 51:48.813
You know
what they're most afraid of...

51:48.914 --> 51:52.851
is that you don't look
any different at all.

51:52.952 --> 51:55.987
I'm telling you,
to have gone through all this

51:56.088 --> 51:58.356
just to be ruled over
by humans--

51:58.457 --> 52:02.260
<i>We don't look like humans.</i>

52:19.211 --> 52:20.512
That's new.

52:25.417 --> 52:29.754
<i>As surely as it rises,</i>
<i>the sun has to set.</i>

53:15.534 --> 53:17.602
You cut this up
with roach powder.

53:17.703 --> 53:19.343
I'm not taking it from you
no more, Fence.

53:19.405 --> 53:21.439
You're damn lucky I get any.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.908
And you pull your neck in, girl.

53:24.009 --> 53:25.143
<i>Get out of there!</i>

53:27.813 --> 53:30.548
Oh, great, here comes Dr. X.

53:30.649 --> 53:32.050
You're selling my mom
drugs again?

53:32.151 --> 53:33.218
Go back in, Milo.

53:33.319 --> 53:34.686
I can handle this boy.

53:34.787 --> 53:36.521
Boy?

53:36.622 --> 53:38.389
Does this look
like some boy toy to you?

53:38.490 --> 53:40.191
Just give me my money.

53:40.292 --> 53:41.292
Ah!

53:42.828 --> 53:44.429
Aah!

53:44.530 --> 53:48.366
Around here I'm the Overlord,

53:48.467 --> 53:49.968
and that's the truth!

53:50.069 --> 53:53.238
Next to them, you're nothing!

53:53.339 --> 53:56.040
Just a boy
with his water pistol.

53:58.911 --> 53:59.811
Milo?

54:03.382 --> 54:04.582
Bro, what you thinking?

54:04.683 --> 54:07.418
Milo! No!

54:07.519 --> 54:09.554
Oh, God!

54:13.192 --> 54:15.193
Not you!

54:15.294 --> 54:17.495
Milo!

54:20.332 --> 54:23.268
Not you!

54:23.369 --> 54:25.169
Ah! What?

54:25.271 --> 54:27.672
No, not you!

54:27.773 --> 54:30.441
Honey?
What?

54:47.259 --> 54:49.861
Honey?

54:58.401 --> 55:01.650
Look it's not just our science
that's been hobbled.

55:01.770 --> 55:03.837
They control our justice system.

55:03.905 --> 55:07.174
My news sites are reporting
they just executed a young kid

55:07.242 --> 55:08.642
from the inner-city projects.

55:08.710 --> 55:10.444
Well, we're getting
eyewitness reports

55:10.512 --> 55:12.913
that say it was an accident.

55:12.981 --> 55:15.950
Do the Overlords
allow accidents?

55:16.017 --> 55:18.085
Sure, the kid had a gun,

55:18.153 --> 55:21.622
but they took him out
right there and then, no trial.

55:21.690 --> 55:24.058
You break the rules,
bang, you're dead.

55:24.125 --> 55:26.160
They are watching us
all the time,

55:26.228 --> 55:29.697
and they are dealing
in swift moral absolutes.

55:29.764 --> 55:31.165
It's exactly the kind of thing

55:31.233 --> 55:33.400
that makes
the Freedom League rise up.

55:33.468 --> 55:34.602
They think they're God.

55:34.669 --> 55:37.705
I'm glad you mentioned
the big, silent guy.

55:37.772 --> 55:40.207
Let's bring Miss Peretta Jones
into the discussion.

55:40.275 --> 55:43.043
Peretta, you're part
of the Junior Faith Initiative,

55:43.111 --> 55:45.446
which aims to remind
young people of the importance

55:45.513 --> 55:47.915
of remembering God
in these unique times.

55:47.983 --> 55:50.317
<i>Oh, yes, I guess we have to.</i>

55:50.385 --> 55:52.686
<i>The Overlords</i>
<i>have destroyed God.</i>

55:52.754 --> 55:55.222
<i>My mother</i>
<i>was a devout Christian.</i>

55:55.290 --> 55:57.358
<i>We lived in the poorest part</i>
<i>of Brazil.</i>

55:57.425 --> 56:01.562
When the Overlords came,
she lost her faith.

56:01.630 --> 56:04.098
My mother decided that she
couldn't live in a world

56:04.165 --> 56:08.102
without God,
so she killed herself.

56:08.169 --> 56:10.537
My fear is
that the next generation

56:10.605 --> 56:13.073
won't remember
there was ever talk of God.

56:13.141 --> 56:16.243
It's clear they control
our political process,

56:16.311 --> 56:18.379
our law enforcement,

56:18.446 --> 56:20.281
and though I'm not
a religious man,

56:20.348 --> 56:22.783
Miss Peretta makes
a very good point.

56:22.851 --> 56:26.553
They're controlling the way
we think.

56:43.872 --> 56:45.439
This is nice.

56:45.507 --> 56:49.043
Just you, me,
and the 5,000 by the gate.

56:49.110 --> 56:51.512
Maybe I'll go take them
some loaves and fishes later.

56:51.579 --> 56:53.914
They'll like that.

56:59.788 --> 57:02.856
So, uh,

57:02.924 --> 57:06.060
what with world peace
and all that stuff,

57:06.127 --> 57:11.465
do you even need
to go back up there anymore?

57:11.533 --> 57:13.634
Babe,
I guess that's up to Karellen.

57:17.272 --> 57:18.806
It's up to you.

57:22.811 --> 57:25.913
All right.

57:25.980 --> 57:28.382
I'll tell you what.

57:28.450 --> 57:30.884
Why don't we get this wedding
back on track?

57:30.952 --> 57:33.921
Do you want to?

57:33.988 --> 57:36.123
I love you, Els.

57:36.191 --> 57:41.729
Hey...
I love you.

57:41.796 --> 57:45.165
But you never would have
if things had been different,

57:45.233 --> 57:47.568
if Annabel was still...

57:47.635 --> 57:51.538
and I can't help thinking things
are different for you up there.

57:51.606 --> 57:55.275
Karellen is not
letting you move on.

57:55.343 --> 57:58.412
He's built this dollhouse of
the past to control you somehow.

57:58.480 --> 58:00.447
Okay, just give--just give me
a little bit of credit here.

58:00.515 --> 58:01.648
You're distant from me.

58:01.716 --> 58:04.885
Because I have responsibility.

58:04.953 --> 58:06.053
I'm sorry.

58:06.121 --> 58:09.590
As much as you may want,
this is not about us.

58:09.657 --> 58:11.825
This is--this is about
the whole damn world.

58:11.893 --> 58:13.761
You're my whole damn world.

58:21.836 --> 58:24.138
What's up there isn't real.

59:07.882 --> 59:09.249
All right, guys, hey, come on.

59:09.317 --> 59:11.585
Back on
the other side of the fence.

59:14.222 --> 59:15.789
Ricky.

59:19.594 --> 59:20.794
Ricky?

59:45.153 --> 59:47.221
Know what they call you?

59:47.288 --> 59:50.224
The Blue Collar Prophet.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.892
Cool, huh?

59:54.562 --> 59:56.964
Where are you from?

59:57.031 --> 59:59.299
Mexico City.

59:59.367 --> 01:00:03.203
How's the air
in Mexico City these days?

01:00:03.271 --> 01:00:05.072
It's clean.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.118
Listen, if you don't have him,
you need to help him.

01:00:58.426 --> 01:00:59.660
You can do anything, right?

01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:03.797
So you find him,
and you bring him back to me.

01:01:10.672 --> 01:01:13.707
Bring him home.

01:01:21.215 --> 01:01:22.983
What's she doing?

01:01:52.046 --> 01:01:55.649
Coffee?

01:01:55.717 --> 01:01:58.251
Want to tell me what part
of your journalistic experience

01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:01.355
gives you the chops
to play general?

01:02:01.422 --> 01:02:04.725
I'm not playing general.

01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:07.227
I'm a pacifist.

01:02:09.297 --> 01:02:12.899
We are 120 miles
from the nearest town,

01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:15.235
150 feet underground,

01:02:15.303 --> 01:02:17.738
lead-shielded, self-sufficient,

01:02:17.805 --> 01:02:21.074
and off-grid,
I believe they like to call it.

01:02:21.142 --> 01:02:23.543
So what are you trying
to do here, Wainwright?

01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.346
You want to--you want
to start a war?

01:02:26.414 --> 01:02:27.614
Come on,
you're smarter than that.

01:02:27.682 --> 01:02:29.249
You know you can't win.

01:02:29.317 --> 01:02:30.384
You're right.

01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:34.554
We can't win a war against them,

01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:39.059
but organized resistance?

01:02:39.127 --> 01:02:40.894
Now, that's different.

01:02:40.962 --> 01:02:42.696
You see,

01:02:42.764 --> 01:02:45.966
<i>Karellen likes to see</i>
<i>himself as the benign overlord.</i>

01:02:46.034 --> 01:02:48.635
<i>What if we stopped working</i>
<i>with him?</i>

01:02:48.703 --> 01:02:52.606
<i>What if we destroy</i>
<i>our clean power plants,</i>

01:02:52.674 --> 01:02:54.508
pollute our irrigation systems?

01:02:54.575 --> 01:02:55.642
But listen to yourself.

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:57.744
Defiance.

01:02:57.812 --> 01:03:00.614
If we stop following them,
they've failed.

01:03:00.682 --> 01:03:04.751
So you destroy every good gift
they've given us.

01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:06.486
Then what?

01:03:06.554 --> 01:03:07.988
They leave.

01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:09.222
What choice do they have?

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.025
So we can just screw the world
up all over again.

01:03:12.093 --> 01:03:15.595
<i>I'd rather the world</i>
<i>went down the toilet</i>

01:03:15.663 --> 01:03:19.366
<i>under our control</i>
<i>than flourished under theirs.</i>

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:22.069
Oh, okay, I get it.

01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:27.541
So then--so this is about
who's holding the power, right?

01:03:27.608 --> 01:03:30.310
'Cause you used to hold
the reins to public opinion.

01:03:30.378 --> 01:03:33.980
Now you don't like that they've
taken that from you.

01:03:34.048 --> 01:03:35.982
You've got--you got to wrap
your head around the fact

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:39.886
that working with them is not
the same as working for them.

01:03:39.954 --> 01:03:43.223
Semantics, Ricky.

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:46.860
So what the hell
do you want from me?

01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:52.632
I want you to join the
Freedom League and speak for us.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.335
No.

01:03:55.403 --> 01:03:58.205
<i>Then the Overlords</i>
<i>have their first martyr.</i>

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.587
Did he plan that for the camera?

01:05:09.977 --> 01:05:14.181
Are you hurt?

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:18.285
No.

01:05:18.352 --> 01:05:20.554
Time has changed.

01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:24.224
Our time.

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:26.927
A second is an hour to us.

01:05:28.129 --> 01:05:30.764
Remember how we used
to talk about that?

01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:34.467
How we wished that a night
would last a whole year?

01:05:45.213 --> 01:05:47.214
Don't come to me like this,
Karellen.

01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:49.783
I'm not Karellen, Ricky.

01:05:53.788 --> 01:05:57.657
Then what are you?

01:05:57.725 --> 01:06:00.060
A memory.

01:06:00.127 --> 01:06:04.464
A ripple in a pond.

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:09.402
I'm not a part of them.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.505
I'm a part of you.

01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:16.176
Why would Karellen send you?

01:06:16.244 --> 01:06:17.944
He could have sent anything.

01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:19.880
No, he couldn't.

01:06:19.947 --> 01:06:22.048
He's led
by what's in your heart.

01:06:24.986 --> 01:06:28.855
That's why he built this room,
our room.

01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.830
No.

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:51.244
I buried you.

01:06:51.312 --> 01:06:54.147
Did you?

01:06:54.215 --> 01:06:57.250
One day you'll understand
why I came back

01:06:57.318 --> 01:07:00.620
and why he built the room.

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:02.555
Ricky?

01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:33.520
What's happening to us?

01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:35.255
Oh, come here.
Come here.

01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:50.937
Look at you.

01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:55.375
They shouldn't do this to us.

01:07:55.443 --> 01:07:58.411
They're playing with your mind.

01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:05.518
You need to see
who this Karellen really is.

01:08:18.932 --> 01:08:20.633
Be safe.

01:08:20.734 --> 01:08:23.102
Yeah.

01:08:32.578 --> 01:08:34.313
Don't think about it.

01:08:34.413 --> 01:08:35.648
Just do it.

01:08:42.856 --> 01:08:44.991
You guys see everything, right?

01:08:45.091 --> 01:08:46.559
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.894
So then you could have
stopped them from taking me.

01:08:48.996 --> 01:08:51.330
<i>We could have</i>
<i>neutralized his armies,</i>

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:54.634
<i>but we needed the world</i>
<i>to see what human resistance</i>

01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:56.167
<i>is capable of,</i>

01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:00.773
<i>that they would murder someone</i>
<i>so beloved for their cause.</i>

01:09:00.874 --> 01:09:03.109
<i>Their spirit is broken now.</i>

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:06.145
<i>The Freedom League</i>
<i>is disbanding.</i>

01:09:06.246 --> 01:09:09.582
<i>We are doing this</i>
<i>for your own good.</i>

01:09:09.683 --> 01:09:11.817
Let me tell you a little
something about trust, Karellen.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:13.486
It works both ways.

01:09:13.587 --> 01:09:16.822
<i>The World Federation</i>
<i>is being founded.</i>

01:09:16.923 --> 01:09:19.692
<i>Your nations</i>
<i>will now unite as one.</i>

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:23.129
<i>The first stage is complete.</i>

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.529
He's exactly right.

01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:27.466
I'm just talking to myself.

01:09:27.567 --> 01:09:30.603
You told me
that you needed my advice

01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:32.138
just as much as we needed yours.

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:33.538
Well, here it is.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.374
As long as you stay hidden
back here,

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:38.310
there's always gonna be people
that don't trust you.

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:40.712
Human beings don't trust
what they can't see.

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:43.983
<i>They trust in a God</i>
<i>they can't see.</i>

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:46.952
<i>Man needs a lot more</i>
<i>psychological preparation</i>

01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:50.756
<i>before we can show ourselves.</i>

01:09:52.759 --> 01:09:54.393
So when?

01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:56.996
<i>Not for many years,</i>

01:09:57.097 --> 01:10:00.333
<i>but when the time is right...</i>

01:10:00.434 --> 01:10:03.235
<i>I know you're disappointed</i>
<i>with my answer,</i>

01:10:03.337 --> 01:10:07.006
<i>but we've seen the effect</i>
<i>our appearance can have.</i>

01:10:07.107 --> 01:10:09.575
So then you have been seen
by people.

01:10:09.676 --> 01:10:13.145
<i>Your world isn't the only</i>
<i>planet we've supervised.</i>

01:10:13.246 --> 01:10:18.284
<i>Now, your work is done here,</i>
<i>I think.</i>

01:10:20.987 --> 01:10:23.856
What?

01:10:23.957 --> 01:10:26.692
So that's it?

01:10:26.793 --> 01:10:29.395
<i>I've so enjoyed our chats.</i>

01:10:29.496 --> 01:10:31.897
Oh--okay, just hold on.

01:10:31.998 --> 01:10:35.067
<i>You'll live to see that day.</i>

01:10:35.168 --> 01:10:37.570
<i>It will be wonderful</i>
<i>for both of us,</i>

01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:42.942
<i>but it will still be very hard</i>
<i>when we finally appear.</i>

01:10:43.043 --> 01:10:44.777
<i>I hope you don't mind me</i>
<i>saying this,</i>

01:10:44.878 --> 01:10:49.014
<i>but I'm going to miss you,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

01:10:49.116 --> 01:10:50.282
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:52.985
Uh, Karellen...

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:55.521
<i>- Good-bye.</i>
- Karellen!

01:11:02.829 --> 01:11:04.930
Karellen was right.

01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:06.999
We can't let anyone see this.

01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:14.440
Just delete it.

01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:16.041
Get rid of 'em.

01:11:24.217 --> 01:11:26.218
I'm done.

01:11:31.825 --> 01:11:34.293
I'm home.

01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:54.547
Ellie Ryberg,

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:57.850
will you marry me?

01:11:59.986 --> 01:12:03.656
Evil can disguise itself
as truth.

01:12:03.757 --> 01:12:06.058
Whatever faith
or belief you have,

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:09.962
know that we're in this battle
together,

01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:13.466
all of us.

01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:16.569
We can never give up the fight.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:21.240
No matter how mighty
the Overlords may seem,

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:22.708
we should never give up.

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:29.181
Remember, there is an ultimate
truth in this universe.

01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:36.889
I will never,
ever stop believing that.

01:12:49.169 --> 01:12:51.337
<i>Media magnate</i>
<i>Hugo Wainwright, Jr.</i>

01:12:51.438 --> 01:12:53.873
<i>has been found hanged</i>
<i>in his D.C. office.</i>

01:12:53.974 --> 01:12:56.242
<i>The newspaper proprietor</i>
<i>left no note,</i>

01:12:56.343 --> 01:12:58.944
<i>and there are believed to be</i>
<i>no suspicious circumstances.</i>

01:13:39.553 --> 01:13:43.222
You seem pretty low
for a walking miracle.

01:13:43.323 --> 01:13:46.458
I never used to feel
this different or this scared

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.495
when I was in the chair.

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:52.097
That's 'cause your chair
was a barrier

01:13:52.198 --> 01:13:54.667
protecting you from the world,

01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:57.636
but the barrier's down now.

01:13:57.737 --> 01:14:01.340
You've got to stop hiding
and work out who you are.

01:14:03.209 --> 01:14:05.344
Is that what they did
when they cured me?

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:08.614
Oh, maybe.

01:14:08.715 --> 01:14:12.451
Maybe they think
you got potential.

01:14:12.552 --> 01:14:16.822
On the TV,
they say that science is dying.

01:14:16.923 --> 01:14:18.223
I don't want it to die.

01:14:22.796 --> 01:14:24.797
So what are you gonna do
about that?

01:14:24.898 --> 01:14:29.234
Well, I want to be the first
person to visit their planet.

01:14:33.239 --> 01:14:35.240
Then that is what you'll do.

01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:44.717
<i>Who knows</i>
<i>why they chose 15 years,</i>

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:47.386
<i>but things</i>
<i>had got a whole lot better.</i>

01:14:47.487 --> 01:14:50.656
<i>I got a place at MIT, graduated,</i>

01:14:50.757 --> 01:14:53.058
<i>and got a job in astrophysics.</i>

01:14:53.159 --> 01:14:56.195
<i>Mom got clean and looked</i>
<i>younger than ever before.</i>

01:14:56.296 --> 01:14:59.198
<i>In fact, everyone did.</i>

01:14:59.299 --> 01:15:01.667
<i>"Youth of Utopia,"</i>
<i>they called it.</i>

01:15:01.768 --> 01:15:04.803
<i>The Earth was being reborn,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

01:15:04.904 --> 01:15:07.106
<i>and right now was waiting</i>

01:15:07.207 --> 01:15:09.341
<i>to meet their guardian angels.</i>

01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:19.201
Kenny?

01:15:21.904 --> 01:15:23.071
Milo.

01:15:23.172 --> 01:15:28.043
Oh, my God, Milo.

01:15:28.144 --> 01:15:29.044
Welcome home.

01:15:29.145 --> 01:15:30.612
It's good to be back.

01:15:30.713 --> 01:15:31.913
You still playing scientist?

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:33.949
I am in the dwindling
dodo profession

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:37.586
that is astrophysics, yes, sir.

01:15:37.687 --> 01:15:41.022
Man, I mean, wow.

01:15:41.123 --> 01:15:42.157
Look at this.

01:15:42.258 --> 01:15:44.226
Everything--
everything's changed.

01:15:44.327 --> 01:15:48.063
Yeah, most of these are empty.

01:15:48.164 --> 01:15:50.832
When folk found out they
didn't have to earn money,

01:15:50.933 --> 01:15:54.336
they just cleared on out
into them wide-open spaces.

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:56.638
- It's pretty much all mine now.
- Yeah?

01:15:56.739 --> 01:15:58.740
- Mm.
- I mean, you looked after?

01:16:07.183 --> 01:16:11.086
People leave this for me
every few days.

01:16:11.187 --> 01:16:12.921
I have music.

01:16:13.022 --> 01:16:15.023
I have peace.

01:16:15.124 --> 01:16:17.792
They did it, Milo.
They did it.

01:16:17.894 --> 01:16:22.464
They showed us
how to make heaven on Earth.

01:16:22.565 --> 01:16:23.899
Mm!

01:16:26.435 --> 01:16:28.036
- It's a big day.
- Yes, it is.

01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:29.817
Thought maybe you'd want
to come to a bar

01:16:29.906 --> 01:16:33.375
and share it with me.

01:16:33.476 --> 01:16:35.143
I don't need to see them, Milo.

01:16:35.244 --> 01:16:37.379
What are you talking about?

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.181
I've seen enough.

01:16:40.283 --> 01:16:42.150
You know me.
I could never see enough.

01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:01.036
Hey, buddy.

01:17:01.137 --> 01:17:02.971
Come on, Dad, it's started.

01:17:03.072 --> 01:17:04.639
What's started?

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.907
- Jake!
- What's that?

01:17:06.008 --> 01:17:07.442
- Come on!
- All right.

01:17:07.543 --> 01:17:09.411
What are you doing?

01:17:09.512 --> 01:17:13.481
Ahh.
No hello?

01:17:13.583 --> 01:17:16.284
Right there.
Okay.

01:17:16.385 --> 01:17:18.753
<i>It's hard to believe</i>
<i>that our wait is over,</i>

01:17:18.854 --> 01:17:20.322
<i>but it is,</i>

01:17:20.423 --> 01:17:23.124
<i>and it seems that the</i>
<i>supervisor for Earth, Karellen,</i>

01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:26.127
<i>deems us ready</i>
<i>to look him in the eye.</i>

01:17:26.228 --> 01:17:27.662
<i>And here we are at</i>
<i>the designated monument site--</i>

01:17:27.763 --> 01:17:31.866
I can't believe it's arrived.
We're ready, huh?

01:17:31.968 --> 01:17:35.971
Guess we are, Amy.
Guess we are.

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:49.951
<i>It's a beautiful, balmy evening</i>

01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:54.723
<i>as the sun starts to set on</i>
<i>the 200,000 excited spectators.</i>

01:17:54.824 --> 01:17:56.458
<i>Delegates</i>
<i>from the World Federation</i>

01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:58.360
<i>are taking to the main podium.</i>

01:17:58.461 --> 01:18:00.762
<i>It's fair to say</i>
<i>that everybody's breath</i>

01:18:00.863 --> 01:18:04.232
<i>is truly bated as we wait</i>
<i>to meet our guardian angels.</i>

01:18:07.236 --> 01:18:11.840
<i>There's--there's</i>
<i>some disturbance in the sky.</i>

01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:23.685
<i>And it's here.</i>

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:26.488
<i>It's above us right now.</i>

01:18:35.998 --> 01:18:37.399
<i>People are on their feet.</i>

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.001
<i>We haven't seen</i>
<i>an Overlord ship this close</i>

01:18:40.102 --> 01:18:43.705
<i>since they first arrived</i>
<i>over a decade and a half ago.</i>

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:47.409
<i>Now, it does appear to be</i>
<i>docking with the arrival ramp.</i>

01:18:52.114 --> 01:18:54.382
<i>And it's docked.</i>
<i>The ship is docked.</i>

01:19:05.461 --> 01:19:07.796
<i>This is Karellen.</i>

01:19:07.897 --> 01:19:10.632
<i>Let the children come forward.</i>

01:19:10.733 --> 01:19:12.634
<i>The child greeters</i>
<i>that Karellen asked for</i>

01:19:12.735 --> 01:19:15.003
<i>are now entering</i>
<i>the arrival ramp.</i>

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.348
My God.

01:20:17.633 --> 01:20:21.069
Karellen was right
to hide himself from us.

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:23.271
Still, I think, uh...

01:20:23.372 --> 01:20:26.307
I think it may be too soon.

01:20:28.511 --> 01:20:33.114
This world will be okay,
won't it?

01:20:33.215 --> 01:20:35.817
Yeah.

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:39.554
Yeah, I think so.

01:20:43.692 --> 01:20:47.996
Hello.

01:20:48.097 --> 01:20:51.232
There is no need to be afraid.
