00:01.040 --> 00:02.386
<i>Sports Illustrated
has this team...</i>

00:02.388 --> 00:04.520
<i>as the number one high school
football team in Texas.</i>

00:04.521 --> 00:05.964
Got yourself
a heck of a quarterback.

00:05.965 --> 00:08.343
- Is it true, Mr. Street?
- That I love Lyla Garrity?

00:08.344 --> 00:10.909
<i>Street the only one
to be able to get to him.</i>

00:10.910 --> 00:13.477
<i>A gigantic hit on Street.</i>

00:13.611 --> 00:15.344
Jason's paralyzed.

00:15.777 --> 00:17.843
This is not just some game,
you realize that,

00:17.877 --> 00:19.275
after what's happened
with Jason.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.300
It's about this town.

00:20.313 --> 00:22.365
It's about the spirit
and keeping this town alive.

00:22.368 --> 00:25.609
You think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

00:25.609 --> 00:27.441
You got a job to do.

00:27.449 --> 00:29.342
This is all yours
for the taking.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.322
You know, Jason's been
asking about you.

00:31.336 --> 00:34.171
You know, you wait too long,
he might start taking it personal too.

00:34.216 --> 00:37.213
You want to help, then stop pretending
that everything's okay.

00:37.216 --> 00:40.343
He's never gonna walk again!

00:41.715 --> 00:44.870
<i>What happened with us came from
all these feelings about Jason.</i>

00:44.877 --> 00:47.200
<i>They're trying to bring in
this Katrina refugee.</i>

00:47.218 --> 00:49.613
<i>We got ourselves
a quarterback, Coach.</i>

00:52.148 --> 00:54.601
Can you tell me who
you're thinking about starting?

00:54.617 --> 00:56.841
If you want it to be you, you're
gonna have to show me a lot more

00:56.847 --> 00:58.242
than what you've been showing me
on the field this week.

00:58.248 --> 01:01.212
I can't stop thinking
about you, Lyla.

01:19.977 --> 01:21.203
Morning.

01:21.816 --> 01:25.103
- No hospital today?
- No, I'm going for a run.

01:25.727 --> 01:26.870
I think this is--

01:28.425 --> 01:29.363
Hey...

01:29.367 --> 01:33.161
I think it's really great.
You're doing something for yourself.

01:34.888 --> 01:36.510
Thanks, Mom.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.271
Have a good day, sweetie.

01:40.416 --> 01:43.412
<i>I own this place,
it's part of me</i>

01:43.448 --> 01:45.873
<i>It fills me up
and swallows me</i>

01:45.916 --> 01:48.312
<i>And I am oceans,
rocks, and vines</i>

01:48.345 --> 01:51.641
<i>Reaching for
the sun that shines</i>

01:51.675 --> 01:53.813
<i>Oh, I must say,
I adore you</i>

01:53.847 --> 01:56.473
<i>But sometimes
I seem to ignore you</i>

01:56.517 --> 01:59.612
<i>That's because
I don't deserve you</i>

01:59.618 --> 02:02.310
<i>Or have your love
for me ever</i>

02:02.346 --> 02:06.613
<i>All this time
I wanted you to know</i>

02:06.645 --> 02:09.640
<i>That if you're ever...</i>

02:13.077 --> 02:14.473
Yeah?

02:18.857 --> 02:20.113
Hi.

02:33.878 --> 02:34.743
You hungry?

02:35.107 --> 02:35.812
Yeah.

02:35.985 --> 02:37.762
It's not much, but--

02:46.987 --> 02:48.670
Is your brother here?

02:48.718 --> 02:50.712
No.

03:15.748 --> 03:17.740
<i>Hey, Sammy, it's Wednesday.</i>

03:17.777 --> 03:20.212
<i>When are we gonna get
the decision from Coach Taylor?</i>

03:20.248 --> 03:22.372
<i>Is it gonna be Voodoo,
or is it gonna be Saracen?</i>

03:22.415 --> 03:24.073
<i>Well, we're on
the same page there, Fred.</i>

03:24.085 --> 03:25.611
<i>We're all waiting
for that answer.</i>

03:25.615 --> 03:28.013
<i>Voodoo's a star, man.
We gotta see that kid play.</i>

03:28.048 --> 03:30.842
<i>A team does not function with
a quarterback controversy.</i>

03:30.845 --> 03:32.510
<i>He's just gotta go out
and pick one.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:33.841
<i>Well, my friend, as I said,</i>

03:33.888 --> 03:35.371
<i>I don't think
you're alone there.</i>

03:35.418 --> 03:37.173
I found this national web site

03:37.216 --> 03:39.641
listing all these open
high school coaching jobs.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.210
You did not.

03:41.247 --> 03:42.772
There's one in Miami.

03:42.816 --> 03:44.943
There's another school in New York.

03:44.988 --> 03:48.240
There's even a head coaching
job in Seattle.

03:48.276 --> 03:49.913
And it comes with a house
in "Pudget" Sound.

03:49.945 --> 03:51.410
Puget Sound.

03:52.678 --> 03:53.840
You know what I heard once?

03:53.888 --> 03:56.602
I heard that a daughter
is supposed to be a comfort

03:56.645 --> 03:59.540
and a blessing
to her father.

03:59.577 --> 04:01.442
Texas isn't even a state.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.170
Technically, it's a republic.

04:03.217 --> 04:06.102
It'd be nice to live somewhere
that's actually a part of this planet.

04:06.217 --> 04:09.211
Do y'all think that they actually
have football in Seattle?

04:09.315 --> 04:11.470
Not the same thing.

04:14.145 --> 04:15.710
Come on, on the hop, guys,
let's get out of here.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.142
Mike, get Voodoo
out of the weight room.

04:17.178 --> 04:18.839
- Tell him I want to see him.
- In the office?

04:18.887 --> 04:20.911
- Yeah, in my office.
- All right, I'll send him in.

04:20.946 --> 04:22.440
Voodoo!

04:25.757 --> 04:28.100
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Sit down.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.082
How you doing?

04:43.216 --> 04:45.582
Listen, we haven't
had much time to talk.

04:46.247 --> 04:50.531
And, uh, it's been
pretty busy around here.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.153
I just thought that--

04:53.286 --> 04:56.451
Well, you know I'm gonna
be making a decision soon about Friday.

04:59.586 --> 05:02.551
This is where you might want
to chime in about

05:02.658 --> 05:06.402
how you relish the opportunity.
Or, you know, you're not gonna let me down.

05:06.457 --> 05:09.150
You might want to add something about
the insight you've gained into the game of football

05:09.195 --> 05:12.562
in the short time you've been lucky enough
to be a Dillon Panther.

05:15.788 --> 05:18.452
I'm not here
to make friends.

05:18.487 --> 05:20.883
This ain't my home.
This ain't my school.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.113
It never will be.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.182
Yeah?

05:23.216 --> 05:26.211
I don't like the food here,
the music, the weather.

05:26.328 --> 05:28.813
I can definitely do without
everybody going on and on

05:28.896 --> 05:30.551
about the great state of Texas.

05:30.987 --> 05:35.302
I'm here to get noticed, get recruited,
and get my ass to LSU.

05:35.448 --> 05:36.910
And you?

05:36.958 --> 05:38.913
You're just trying to scrape by.

05:38.955 --> 05:42.481
Trying to win some games,
keep your job.

05:42.528 --> 05:45.721
You and me are
an arranged marriage.

05:45.757 --> 05:47.580
Nothing more.

05:47.628 --> 05:49.251
You've seen what I can do.

05:49.286 --> 05:52.882
You want to start Saracen,
you go right ahead.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.973
You wanna leave that door open?

Synch: Tauri41.

06:55.488 --> 06:58.162
Hey, look, you're doing
pretty good out there.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.103
- Blowin' it out in practice.
- Yeah? You think so?

07:00.208 --> 07:01.643
- Yeah, man.
- Cool, thanks.

07:01.646 --> 07:04.803
You and me, State and Main.

07:04.848 --> 07:07.613
- Okay.
- For real.

07:07.918 --> 07:11.413
Hey, hey, where you goin'
there, girl?

07:11.645 --> 07:13.343
Hey, baby, come on back here
and bless me.

07:13.385 --> 07:15.882
Hey, you guys seen Lyla?

07:15.917 --> 07:17.441
Lyla?

07:17.488 --> 07:19.143
What about the Smash, baby?

07:19.885 --> 07:22.403
And don't forget about my boy here,
Matty Saracen.

07:22.638 --> 07:24.810
Hey, Matt.
Are you starting on Friday?

07:24.818 --> 07:27.413
I-I might be.
I might.

07:31.346 --> 07:34.411
Oh, boy.
You're drawing up plays.

07:34.647 --> 07:36.413
Oh, thank you.

07:36.445 --> 07:37.881
Thank you. I'll take it.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.813
Oh... We're having dinner.

07:38.845 --> 07:41.210
You can forage for them later.

07:41.245 --> 07:43.283
This looks good.

07:43.318 --> 07:45.313
Here you go.

07:45.316 --> 07:47.181
One triple-chocolate meltdown.

07:49.548 --> 07:50.910
You're not my waitress.

07:50.947 --> 07:53.110
Shift change.
Lucky me.

07:54.987 --> 07:56.853
I'm not sure how
I feel about this.

07:56.896 --> 07:58.472
I mean, it's kind of abrupt.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.173
I had a thing going
with this other lady.

08:00.185 --> 08:03.071
She was bringing me
napkins and mints.

08:03.087 --> 08:04.743
See, you know, that's rough.

08:04.808 --> 08:05.941
But at her age,

08:05.988 --> 08:08.010
Carlene can only handle
the day shift.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.312
Plus, there's a
"Murder, She Wrote" marathon

08:10.397 --> 08:12.341
- on this weekend, so--
- I'm stuck with you.

08:12.396 --> 08:14.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:18.946 --> 08:20.480
Whoa, what's going on
out there?

08:20.513 --> 08:22.125
Just a bunch of overheated jocks,

08:22.198 --> 08:23.749
too dumb to know
they have no future,

08:23.799 --> 08:25.351
fighting over a game
that has no meaning,

08:25.399 --> 08:28.982
in a town from which
there is no escape.

08:30.746 --> 08:33.210
That's, uh--
Wow.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.941
Anyway, my name is Tyra,

08:35.948 --> 08:37.840
and I'll be at your service
for the next six hours.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.113
Okay.

08:44.346 --> 08:45.842
All right, good. Good.

08:45.886 --> 08:47.642
Let's go, let's go!

08:47.687 --> 08:49.840
Get 'em over there!

08:50.986 --> 08:52.311
Lookin' good, yeah.

08:52.347 --> 08:53.513
Stay low and drive.

08:53.548 --> 08:55.082
Aim for the "B."

08:55.116 --> 08:56.680
There it is.
All right, good.

08:56.717 --> 08:58.881
Now pass.

08:58.915 --> 09:00.780
Bring it down.

09:00.816 --> 09:02.983
Nice, nice.

09:03.015 --> 09:04.243
- Yeah!
- What's going on, Coach?

09:04.285 --> 09:05.383
The guy's looking good,
Coach.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.300
How come Saracen isn't
rotating in with the first team?

09:08.387 --> 09:10.711
I thought last week we said
we were starting Tatom.

09:10.747 --> 09:13.103
I think you said that, and I said,
"Thanks for the opinion, Coach."

09:13.186 --> 09:16.202
Saracen, put your lid on.
Strap up, son. Get your ass in there.

09:16.218 --> 09:18.470
We're rotating him with the first team
until I say otherwise.

09:19.015 --> 09:20.110
Yes, sir.

09:20.245 --> 09:21.913
Get in there, son.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.511
Hey.

09:44.446 --> 09:48.310
You know, there is more
than one restaurant in this town.

09:48.515 --> 09:50.643
I'm just...saying.
Oh.

09:51.217 --> 09:53.282
Well, I just came by
to give you something,

09:53.316 --> 09:56.013
but now, maybe I'm not
feeling like it anymore.

09:56.146 --> 09:57.641
What is it?

09:59.118 --> 10:00.400
You remind me of him.

10:00.716 --> 10:02.601
I remind you of an old,
wrinkled black man

10:02.685 --> 10:05.500
- wearing a weird hat?
- Yeah, something like that.

10:05.585 --> 10:07.181
Okay.

10:07.418 --> 10:10.002
- Well--
- That's it.

10:10.486 --> 10:11.913
Thanks.

10:15.007 --> 10:18.511
Hey, you want to come
for a ride...with me?

10:18.646 --> 10:20.141
A ride?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.911
Yeah, I work for
an investment bank,

10:21.948 --> 10:25.702
and we're looking to see if the oil fields
are worth reopening around here.

10:25.787 --> 10:28.801
I gotta go out to the fields
an do an evaluation.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.902
You know, financial
feasibility, analysis.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.401
- And I'm just boring you to death.
- Yeah, totally.

10:34.208 --> 10:38.301
Anyway, look, I gotta go out to the fields,
meet some geologists.

10:38.918 --> 10:41.003
I was wondering if you'd
want to go for a ride.

10:43.508 --> 10:45.772
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

10:46.516 --> 10:47.612
What?

10:47.947 --> 10:50.410
I wasn't--
I'm not--

10:52.415 --> 10:54.213
I just like your company.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.372
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:01.005 --> 11:02.610
What are you doing here?

11:02.707 --> 11:05.303
I have two parents who work here,
and I can't get either one of them

11:05.375 --> 11:08.010
to sign my stupid
driver's ed form.

11:08.547 --> 11:12.600
Uh, are you--
Are you gonna come to the game on Friday?

11:12.908 --> 11:15.010
Uh, yeah.
My dad's the coach.

11:15.407 --> 11:17.910
He'll have a heart attack
if I don't show up.

11:18.448 --> 11:21.003
So, do you think
you're gonna start?

11:22.406 --> 11:23.511
Uh...I don't know.

11:24.048 --> 11:26.010
That's the coach's decision.

11:26.048 --> 11:28.503
You know, whatever he decides,
I'm there for.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.070
But I've been working hard,
so I'm ready.

11:30.115 --> 11:30.870
I feel good about it.

11:30.915 --> 11:33.412
I just-- You know, whatever he feels
is best for the team,

11:33.508 --> 11:36.011
that's--that's what
I'm ready to do, so.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.803
Dude, you need to chill out.
I'm not ESPN.

11:39.317 --> 11:41.140
Sorry.

11:41.805 --> 11:44.210
No, it's cool.
All right, I'll...

11:44.406 --> 11:46.000
I'll see you around, then.

11:46.308 --> 11:47.372
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.701
You're so stupid.

11:53.007 --> 11:53.840
There you go.

11:53.976 --> 11:56.473
Now try throwing it
back to Raines.

11:57.115 --> 11:58.501
You're doing great.

11:58.846 --> 12:00.340
There you go.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.870
Try to throw it back.

12:05.408 --> 12:07.040
Use your biceps.
You got 'em.

12:08.348 --> 12:10.502
All right, here's the play.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.601
Go about 15 yards, run a post pattern.
I'll hit you by the water cooler.

12:18.876 --> 12:23.502
Phil, get QB in a van this afternoon.
Get him downtown to the center.

12:23.715 --> 12:25.572
You know I can't authorize that.

12:25.617 --> 12:29.040
Authorize this, Phil.
I want to show this boy his future.

12:33.806 --> 12:35.811
What's happening
this afternoon, Phil?

12:42.347 --> 12:44.041
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

12:44.075 --> 12:46.271
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

12:46.316 --> 12:49.870
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

12:49.915 --> 12:51.372
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

12:51.417 --> 12:53.141
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

12:53.176 --> 12:56.972
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

12:57.017 --> 13:01.770
<i>Dream, dreamer
get in your way</i>

13:01.815 --> 13:06.040
<i>Always do this to where?</i>

13:06.077 --> 13:09.741
<i>Lose yourself to the sea</i>

13:09.778 --> 13:11.843
<i>Am I only a dream?</i>

13:11.876 --> 13:13.370
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

13:13.416 --> 13:15.370
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

13:15.418 --> 13:20.073
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

13:27.848 --> 13:30.703
Hey, miss Lyla Garrity.
Come in here and sit down.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.201
Well, it's not true what
they say about cheerleaders.

13:33.298 --> 13:35.802
That you're all just a bunch of T and A,
and nothing between the ears.

13:35.918 --> 13:37.440
Excuse me, Mrs. Taylor?

13:37.475 --> 13:39.840
Well, I mean, you got
straight-As, girl.

13:40.076 --> 13:40.642
Good.

13:40.775 --> 13:43.213
- Thank you.
- That's awesome.

13:43.247 --> 13:46.541
Yeah, so, what are you thinking?
Are you thinking about colleges?

13:47.748 --> 13:50.700
Well, I always figured I'd wait to see
what school Jason was gonna play for.

13:51.218 --> 13:52.243
Probably Notre Dame.

13:52.475 --> 13:55.672
So, I'd probably end up taking
classes at St. Mary's.

13:56.348 --> 13:59.842
You know, and enroll full-time
once Jason was settled in.

14:00.916 --> 14:04.102
Well, college football is so much
more demanding than high school.

14:04.318 --> 14:07.543
- I'd want to be there for him.
- I understand that.

14:07.648 --> 14:09.810
But, you know,
I was actually thinking,

14:10.545 --> 14:14.140
separate from that,
what you might want to do.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.813
I guess with Jason's
recovery and all,

14:20.147 --> 14:22.470
I really haven't had the time
to give that much thought.

14:22.518 --> 14:23.841
I know, I know.

14:24.576 --> 14:29.272
But that's why I thought maybe it'd be
a good idea for you to come in here.

14:29.766 --> 14:31.712
Maybe it's time to start
thinking about it.

14:32.988 --> 14:33.773
What do you think?

14:49.808 --> 14:50.883
What the hell are you doing?

14:50.888 --> 14:52.870
Copying the playbook.
What do you think I'm doin'?

14:55.646 --> 14:56.571
Tatom's been borrowing mine,

14:56.617 --> 14:58.900
so I thought it was about time
he got one of his own.

14:59.018 --> 15:00.872
You got a problem with that now?

15:01.006 --> 15:04.071
No, I just like to know
what's going on in my office.

15:04.306 --> 15:06.913
Like I like to know
what's going on with my offense.

15:07.076 --> 15:09.300
You know, I don't really care for
what you're insinuating there.

15:09.477 --> 15:11.100
Mac, I'm not insinuating anything.

15:11.218 --> 15:15.400
But since we're broaching the subject,
I can tell you one thing that I don't like.

15:15.578 --> 15:17.841
I don't like
my offensive coordinator

15:18.005 --> 15:20.340
chatting up Buddy Garrity,
like he's on a date.

15:20.405 --> 15:21.601
I don't care for that too much.

15:21.718 --> 15:24.502
Look, who I have a drink with
is none of your damn business.

15:24.607 --> 15:25.101
Easy.

15:25.208 --> 15:28.602
You think I want your job, right?
Well, you're damn right I do.

15:28.706 --> 15:31.003
'Cause the way I see it, 
you're sitting in my chair.

15:32.036 --> 15:33.801
But I'll never do anything
to hurt these kids.

15:33.816 --> 15:37.501
I want to win, just like you do.
These are my boys too.

15:37.805 --> 15:40.702
So you pull it together.
Got me?

15:49.345 --> 15:51.473
See, this is what i fear about.

15:51.585 --> 15:54.960
We've got mass-producing
Borden County,

15:54.976 --> 15:56.182
mass-producing Howard County.

15:56.705 --> 16:01.203
We move over here into Dillon, though,
and we've got, you know, almost--

16:01.306 --> 16:04.730
Yeah, again, I suggested
like you did, boss.

16:04.977 --> 16:07.671
You guys know better than I do.

16:08.905 --> 16:10.572
I don't know.

16:10.906 --> 16:12.203
I guess I just have to laugh.

16:12.277 --> 16:15.001
All these people so caught up
in their tiny little lives.

16:15.205 --> 16:16.631
It's ridiculous, don't you think?

16:17.837 --> 16:19.201
What?

16:19.977 --> 16:21.032
Nothing.

16:21.175 --> 16:23.671
You're opinionated.
I like that.

16:25.536 --> 16:27.333
You know what else I hate,
just for the record?

16:27.477 --> 16:28.832
- What?
- Oil.

16:29.506 --> 16:30.833
Ok.

16:30.977 --> 16:32.170
Why?

16:32.507 --> 16:36.700
I know it's a widely held belief,
but any particular reason?

16:37.006 --> 16:40.001
I hate what it did to my father.

16:40.535 --> 16:43.002
This whole town, really.

16:44.508 --> 16:48.130
My father, he lost his job
as a rigger in the last bust.

16:50.005 --> 16:53.002
I mean, it's worse than crack.

16:53.135 --> 16:56.000
These dealers come in promising
good times will last forever.

16:56.107 --> 16:58.203
And just as fast, it's gone.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.803
And all the money's gone with it.

17:04.535 --> 17:05.672
You want to know a secret?

17:06.205 --> 17:07.329
Hmm?

17:07.477 --> 17:09.470
I'm not a big fan of oil either.

17:09.807 --> 17:10.330
Oh.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.531
Really?

17:11.578 --> 17:13.402
Back home, I drive a hybrid.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.002
You like it out there in Los Angeles?

17:20.576 --> 17:23.001
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

17:25.008 --> 17:27.301
You know, you'd do all right out there.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.200
So, um...

17:32.805 --> 17:34.502
how long are you gonna be here for?

17:34.975 --> 17:38.332
I don't know.
As long as my boss wants me to be.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.332
Another week, at least.

17:43.176 --> 17:47.333
So what would you say
to dinner tomorrow night?

17:47.477 --> 17:50.001
Real dinner, I mean.

17:51.608 --> 17:55.002
Yeah. I'd like that.

17:55.136 --> 17:58.002
<i>One scotch, one bourbon</i>

17:58.036 --> 18:00.070
<i>And one beer</i>

18:12.007 --> 18:13.471
Hey, QB.

18:13.905 --> 18:16.801
Oh, hey-- Hey, Herc.

18:18.237 --> 18:20.000
Sorry.

18:20.406 --> 18:21.873
When was that?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.773
Well, that was a while back.

18:28.706 --> 18:31.003
Ooh, you're getting good at that.

18:31.135 --> 18:32.003
Look at you.

18:33.108 --> 18:35.130
Very nice.

18:35.176 --> 18:37.130
Very put out.

18:38.008 --> 18:38.830
What's your injury?

18:38.875 --> 18:40.931
The same as you.
C7-T1.

18:41.476 --> 18:45.702
We got our fingers.
We're the lucky ones around here.

18:46.205 --> 18:47.573
Oh, yeah, real lucky.

18:49.308 --> 18:51.572
It's all relative, QB.

18:54.605 --> 18:57.700
How, uh-- How long before you, uh,

18:58.078 --> 19:00.070
you started playing
quad rugby?

19:00.308 --> 19:01.802
About a year.

19:01.936 --> 19:05.602
Of course, I wasted a good six months
drowning in a sea of self-pity.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.031
Six months?

19:08.006 --> 19:09.600
Six months.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.133
How's that calculus going?

19:19.478 --> 19:20.702
What calculus?

19:21.406 --> 19:23.303
You know, you were talking
about it the other day.

19:23.475 --> 19:24.571
I don't know.

19:24.608 --> 19:25.971
Advance-placement trig?

19:26.905 --> 19:27.971
Yeah.

19:28.106 --> 19:29.401
How's that going?

19:30.235 --> 19:32.070
It's going fine.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.073
I know you were worried about it
the other day.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.670
You had some big test
coming up.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.670
- Tim, just don't do this, okay?
- Do what?

19:38.737 --> 19:42.101
Pretend that you're interested
in my schoolwork.

19:42.608 --> 19:46.002
It's obvious that you're not,
that you're just trying to--

19:46.076 --> 19:48.200
Have a conversation, Lyla?

19:48.437 --> 19:52.230
Yeah, I thought we may want
to try and do that sometime.

19:52.478 --> 19:54.102
Okay.

19:54.807 --> 19:57.001
What do you want to talk about, Tim?

19:58.205 --> 19:59.603
The fact that you're sleeping with

19:59.685 --> 20:02.202
your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend?

20:02.475 --> 20:04.973
Is that what you want
to talk about, Tim?

20:09.078 --> 20:12.501
No, I don't think we're going
to be doing a lot of talking.

20:43.638 --> 20:46.602
I just wanted to see if you might be
coming home for dinner tonight.

20:46.707 --> 20:48.873
I don't think I'm gonna
be home for dinner tonight.

20:48.958 --> 20:51.003
Your daughter was asking
for a picture of you,

20:51.035 --> 20:53.532
and so I just thought you might
like to weigh in on which one--

20:53.576 --> 20:55.272
That's not funny.
Don't do that.

20:57.406 --> 21:00.332
We sure would love to see you.

21:00.477 --> 21:01.703
How was your day today?

21:01.738 --> 21:02.902
- It was all right.
- Yeah?

21:02.938 --> 21:03.802
How was yours?

21:04.436 --> 21:05.973
If you listen to
the TV or the radio,

21:06.007 --> 21:08.100
I'm the coach that can't
get the decision made.

21:08.438 --> 21:09.833
Can't make a decision.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.231
Can I help you
make the decision?

21:11.278 --> 21:14.101
Sure, go ahead. Make the decision, Honey.
What's your decision? You make the call.

21:14.197 --> 21:15.333
Start Saracen.

21:15.395 --> 21:17.702
Start Saracen? 
I cannot start Matt Saracen.

21:17.837 --> 21:18.500
Then start Voodoo.

21:18.537 --> 21:20.102
I don't want to start Voodoo.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.500
Then start me.

21:23.507 --> 21:24.671
I would love to start you.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.532
I would love to start you.

21:26.577 --> 21:30.200
Well, you know, it seems to me here
that at this point, there's just not gonna be

21:30.306 --> 21:32.330
a decision that's gonna feel good.

21:32.905 --> 21:35.800
So the good news is
you can make the decision

21:35.837 --> 21:38.733
and come on home and
have dinner with your family.

21:38.778 --> 21:40.071
See your kid.

21:40.106 --> 21:44.003
Problem is, I've just got
a little, slight problem,

21:44.107 --> 21:45.103
being that...

21:46.305 --> 21:50.003
Matt Saracen, one, is good for the team.
The team will play for Matt Saracen.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.500
There is no doubt about that.

21:51.537 --> 21:54.103
He's done everything I've asked him to do.
He's left it all on the field.

21:54.206 --> 21:55.100
No problem.

21:55.335 --> 21:57.602
I trust the kid.
He trusts me.

21:57.737 --> 22:00.270
This kid Voodoo,
I don't like the kid, one.

22:00.308 --> 22:03.070
Two, I don't trust the kid.

22:03.106 --> 22:05.651
But three, I believe he can
get it done for us.

22:05.737 --> 22:07.502
I believe he can
win this game for us.

22:07.638 --> 22:10.070
That's it.
That's it right there.

22:10.908 --> 22:13.930
That sounds to me like you've
made your decision, Coach.

22:20.478 --> 22:22.472
Yeah, they said something
about bedrock.

22:22.705 --> 22:25.502
The crude's made up of this stuff.
Could you put Angela on the phone anyway?

22:25.707 --> 22:26.571
Thank you.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.102
Angela, hey, it's Connor.

22:31.466 --> 22:34.000
I'm gonna need a flight back to L.A.

22:34.238 --> 22:35.732
Tomorrow morning's perfect.
Thank you.

22:35.765 --> 22:37.531
All right.
Bye. Hi.

22:37.568 --> 22:40.403
- How you doing?
- I was waiting for you.

22:40.437 --> 22:42.503
That was my boss.

22:43.006 --> 22:45.800
My boss needs me back in L.A.,
so I've gotta cut the trip short.

22:47.305 --> 22:49.730
But I would really like
to go out tonight still.

22:49.867 --> 22:52.601
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

22:52.736 --> 22:53.831
Okay.

22:55.365 --> 22:56.830
- I'll see you later.
- Work.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.232
Bye.

23:02.436 --> 23:03.632
Yeah?

23:04.666 --> 23:08.000
- You wanna talk to me, Coach?
- Yeah. Come on in.

23:15.765 --> 23:17.000
Sit down.

23:19.568 --> 23:22.900
You gave a hell of a week of practice.
I couldn't have asked for anything more.

23:23.077 --> 23:24.002
Thank you, sir.

23:24.108 --> 23:25.403
I just want to let you know that

23:25.606 --> 23:28.842
I really appreciate all the encouragement
you've been giving me.

23:28.945 --> 23:30.600
- And I feel ready for this.

23:30.685 --> 23:32.101
I mean, I feel readier for this

23:32.207 --> 23:33.541
than anything in my whole life.

23:33.678 --> 23:36.002
I'm gonna start Voodoo.

23:38.075 --> 23:39.400
I want you to be ready.

23:39.478 --> 23:41.543
I want you to stay on the playbook.

23:41.976 --> 23:44.242
- Be prepared.
- Mm-hmm.

23:48.947 --> 23:52.503
Yes, thank you.
Thanks for letting me know.

24:23.808 --> 24:26.371
I say if we do our best,
we will have success.

24:26.407 --> 24:28.601
And that we own
the fourth quarter.

24:28.746 --> 24:30.073
The fourth quarter is ours!

24:31.545 --> 24:34.272
The fourth quarter is ours!

24:41.745 --> 24:43.102
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

24:44.147 --> 24:45.740
<i>It's going down tonight!</i>

24:48.175 --> 24:50.402
<i>The Panthers ain't even
began to fight!</i>

24:51.876 --> 24:54.803
<i>Look, they wanna trash
our locker room,</i>

24:55.445 --> 24:57.440
<i>we're fittin' to hit 'em
with a sonic boom!</i>

24:59.677 --> 25:02.002
<i>The Panthers gonna have
the last laugh,</i>

25:02.547 --> 25:04.972
<i>'cause we
breakin' our foot off...</i>

25:06.976 --> 25:08.243
Love you, Daddy.

25:34.878 --> 25:36.900
How you feeling today, Mr. Street?

25:37.205 --> 25:40.301
Well, hello, Miss Garrity.
You look pretty tonight.

25:41.605 --> 25:43.803
What are you doing here?
You're gonna be late for the game.

25:44.047 --> 25:45.200
I know.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.201
You have a visitor.

25:47.885 --> 25:48.843
I do?

25:48.888 --> 25:50.841
Mm-hmm.

25:50.987 --> 25:52.310
- Hey.
- Hey, Coach.

25:52.448 --> 25:53.941
I thought I'd bring up
a little something.

25:54.488 --> 25:56.810
Decorate the room a bit.

25:59.986 --> 26:02.002
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:02.717 --> 26:06.080
God bless, coach.
Good luck.

26:07.045 --> 26:08.511
Clear eyes, full hearts.

26:08.587 --> 26:10.413
Can't lose.

26:29.748 --> 26:31.342
What's up, Street?

26:33.987 --> 26:35.142
What's up, fellas?

26:39.517 --> 26:41.681
Man, look, we just came by
to say we love you.

26:41.915 --> 26:46.000
- We're gonna win for you.
- I know y'all are gonna win.

26:53.615 --> 26:54.780
Get the balls, right?

26:54.816 --> 26:55.882
Yeah, sure.

26:58.436 --> 26:59.911
How you doing, Matt?

27:00.957 --> 27:02.500
Play well, all right?

27:02.508 --> 27:03.281
Thanks.

27:05.075 --> 27:06.541
You get better.

27:06.977 --> 27:08.240
Thanks, Coach.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.521
It's good to see you all.

27:13.626 --> 27:15.390
How you doing?
Get out of there.

27:19.626 --> 27:21.392
Thank you for coming, y'all.

27:37.006 --> 27:39.363
I miss you, Street.

27:39.796 --> 27:41.592
Where the hell you been?

27:45.298 --> 27:47.392
You know.

27:47.626 --> 27:49.620
Around.

27:59.525 --> 28:00.562
Go.

28:02.728 --> 28:04.562
- See you later, okay?
- Okay.

28:04.898 --> 28:06.360
- Love you.
- I love you.

28:06.598 --> 28:08.403
I love you too.

28:45.826 --> 28:46.922
Hi.

28:47.737 --> 28:49.060
Hi.

28:49.665 --> 28:51.383
I thought I was picking you up.

28:51.486 --> 28:53.602
- You're--
- Can I come in?

28:54.418 --> 28:56.343
Um, yeah, of course.

29:25.567 --> 29:30.603
It is Friday night, and Voodoo madness
has put its spell on the Lone Star State.

29:30.646 --> 29:36.620
And 16,000 people have gathered together
to witness the debut of superstar phenom

29:37.097 --> 29:38.791
Ray "Voodoo" Tatom.

29:38.926 --> 29:42.023
And for Coach Taylor, he better hope Voodoo

29:42.055 --> 29:43.401
can get it done tonight.

29:43.607 --> 29:44.823
I can't remember when there was

29:44.856 --> 29:47.921
so much riding on a game
this early in the season.

29:52.096 --> 29:55.450
This is a bitter rivalry,
and no one is about to back down.

29:57.527 --> 30:00.421
Oh, Riggins gets leveled!
And Tatom goes down.

30:00.457 --> 30:02.091
It's another offensive line breakdown.

30:02.126 --> 30:04.102
You know what, Ray Tatom is not happy.

30:04.226 --> 30:06.103
Frustration starting to mount here

30:06.206 --> 30:09.000
as this game plan by Coach Taylor
is not going the way he'd hoped.

30:09.508 --> 30:13.402
Halfway through the second quarter here
as the Panthers are down by a touchdown.

30:13.506 --> 30:15.801
Pro right, 27 China.
Screen pass to Riggins.

30:15.908 --> 30:17.702
We worked on this play
all night--we're setting 'em up.

30:17.807 --> 30:19.301
We can get 'em with this.
Now let's go.

30:19.398 --> 30:20.822
Looks like Smash is gonna shuttle in the play.

30:20.856 --> 30:23.391
I hope Coach Taylor's found
the key to this Tiger defense.

30:23.426 --> 30:26.251
- Pro right, 27 China.
- No, hell, no, man. Forget that.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.120
Hey, you can't change the play.

30:28.155 --> 30:30.050
We gonna win, we gonna play my way.

30:30.198 --> 30:31.321
Let's go, Voodoo, come on!

30:32.206 --> 30:33.350
Tatom's over the ball.

30:33.407 --> 30:34.028
Set!

30:34.028 --> 30:35.492
Hut!

30:36.207 --> 30:37.853
He takes the snap.

30:38.107 --> 30:38.903
Hit him!

30:38.995 --> 30:41.800
- Riggins wide open in the flat.
- He's open! Hit him!

30:42.006 --> 30:43.650
<i>All I want is what's mine</i>

30:43.695 --> 30:46.091
<i>I don't care who I hurt</i>

30:47.126 --> 30:48.151
Go, Voodoo!

30:50.008 --> 30:51.552
He's on his way!

30:51.595 --> 30:53.093
Voodoo Tatom!

30:54.458 --> 30:55.693
He's gonna get it!

30:55.727 --> 30:57.952
It's a touchdown, Dillon Panthers!

30:58.396 --> 31:02.201
Whoo, I tell you what, that is the Voodoo
Tatom we've been waiting for, Sammy!

31:02.296 --> 31:06.353
And Dillon is right back in this thing.

31:10.555 --> 31:12.952
Come here, come here.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.950
You run the plays I call.
You understand?

31:15.027 --> 31:17.692
I give you that one, and that's it!
That one.

31:17.955 --> 31:20.023
- Look at the scoreboard, Coach.
- That one!

31:25.758 --> 31:29.452
And Voodoo has fired up this team
after that stunning touchdown.

31:29.527 --> 31:31.352
And you can feel the momentum shift--

31:31.397 --> 31:32.793
Oh, what a shot!

31:32.827 --> 31:35.252
And the defense is really
bringing on the pain now.

31:35.297 --> 31:38.550
They are playing with purpose,
trying to get that ball back in Tatom's hands

31:38.625 --> 31:40.426
to try and get a lead before the half.

31:40.426 --> 31:43.022
Hey, listen to me.

31:43.055 --> 31:43.992
Listen, Tatom, c'mere.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.491
Tatom. Tatom!

31:45.525 --> 31:46.822
Tatom!

31:47.426 --> 31:49.003
Tatom, get over here!

31:49.556 --> 31:52.202
Seems like a little confusion
over on the sidelines, Sammy.

31:52.295 --> 31:53.353
What's he doing?

31:54.398 --> 31:57.400
Pro right, gun,
triple nine ranger... On one.

31:57.507 --> 31:58.821
Ready?

31:59.055 --> 32:01.221
Coach Taylor seems
a bit perplexed out there.

32:01.258 --> 32:02.320
I don't know what's going on.

32:02.358 --> 32:04.193
Oh! Ohh!

32:04.926 --> 32:06.023
Move, 35!

32:07.156 --> 32:08.623
Hut!

32:08.756 --> 32:10.390
Tatom drops back.

32:10.525 --> 32:12.051
Quick three steps on the right side--

32:12.496 --> 32:14.101
Oh, and it's picked off!

32:14.198 --> 32:18.402
The ball is picked off by the safety,
Fowler, and he's up the left side.

32:20.126 --> 32:22.150
And it doesn't look like
he's gonna be touched.

32:23.006 --> 32:24.921
And that is a touchdown.

32:24.956 --> 32:28.801
Dillon is gonna go into the locker room
down by a touchdown.

32:33.555 --> 32:34.351
Hey!

32:34.596 --> 32:38.103
You pull another stunt like that again,
and you are off this team, you understand me?!

32:38.196 --> 32:39.821
- Move off.
- You understand me?!

32:39.956 --> 32:40.952
Move off me right now!

32:40.997 --> 32:42.392
- You get out of my sight!
- Who?

32:42.426 --> 32:43.592
- You get out of my sight!
- What?

32:43.728 --> 32:45.321
- You're done!
- Done with what?

32:45.355 --> 32:47.552
You are done!
Get out of my sight, son!

32:47.596 --> 32:48.522
You are done!

32:48.557 --> 32:50.150
- I don't care!
- You are done here!

32:50.198 --> 32:51.721
I don't need Texas!

32:51.757 --> 32:53.521
That make you feel big?
Go ahead, you're done, son!

32:53.596 --> 32:55.491
You don't pull that crap
on me out there!

32:55.526 --> 32:57.692
- No one does!
- Fade to black.

33:00.557 --> 33:02.591
- Saracen!
- Yes, sir?

33:04.226 --> 33:07.153
Go warm it up, son.

33:07.598 --> 33:10.622
It all comes down to this, folks.
One minute 18.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.120
Panthers down by 7.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.621
This is our time.
The fourth quarter's ours.

33:14.756 --> 33:16.851
We have worked for this.
We have earned it.

33:17.007 --> 33:22.521
Matt Saracen continues as the quarterback,
and still no sign of Voodoo Tatom.

33:22.955 --> 33:24.701
Bold move by Coach Taylor.

33:24.798 --> 33:27.422
Now we'll see how this
is gonna turn out.

33:29.655 --> 33:31.892
Listen to me, we're gonna
run this team ragged.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.522
- You can lead this team.
- Yes, Sir.

33:33.598 --> 33:35.590
Lead 'em now. Bring it home.

33:35.925 --> 33:38.820
It is a tough road to home for Saracen.

33:40.756 --> 33:43.100
84 yards to go.

33:43.425 --> 33:45.923
All right, we're gonna
wing right, 28 rocket pitch.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.851
Let's do this.
All on one. Ready?

33:47.898 --> 33:49.652
Go!

33:50.896 --> 33:52.152
Set!

33:52.698 --> 33:54.552
Dillon setting up
with three wide to the right.

33:54.597 --> 33:58.152
And with so little time, they probably have
only three or four plays left.

34:02.096 --> 34:07.100
Oh, he goes to the short man, Dolia,
and he's out of bounds at the 32 yard line.

34:07.398 --> 34:08.422
Hut!

34:09.206 --> 34:10.722
There's a pitch out to Williams on the right.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.793
He picks up a block.
He's heading up the sideline.

34:12.826 --> 34:15.690
He gets to the 46 yard line.
Another first down.

34:15.728 --> 34:17.020
And that'll stop the clock.

34:17.058 --> 34:19.190
Let's go, Matt.
Keep it rolling.

34:21.255 --> 34:22.692
Here's Williams on the left side now.

34:22.925 --> 34:23.851
He's running him left!

34:24.097 --> 34:25.992
And Williams got a little bit of room.

34:26.025 --> 34:27.362
And he is pushed out of bounds.

34:27.375 --> 34:30.000
That'll stop the clock
while they move the chains.

34:31.976 --> 34:35.303
Seven seconds. This is the last play
of the game for the Dillon offense.

34:35.435 --> 34:37.831
Let's see if Matt Saracen
can pull this one off.

34:37.878 --> 34:40.900
All right, we're doing the same play,
just with a little twist!

34:46.107 --> 34:49.000
Blue, 8!
Blue, 8!

34:50.406 --> 34:51.570
Hut!

34:52.108 --> 34:54.503
Saracen with another pitch
to Smash Williams on the left side.

34:54.677 --> 34:55.873
Reverse! Reverse!

34:55.906 --> 34:58.403
It's a reverse!
Riggins on the right side.

34:58.436 --> 35:00.873
Look at that block by Saracen!

35:04.605 --> 35:05.830
Touchdown!

35:05.878 --> 35:08.132
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers.

35:08.175 --> 35:12.101
I cannot believe
what I have just seen.

35:12.226 --> 35:15.802
Oh, folks, we have seen
something truly special here tonight.

35:16.107 --> 35:18.832
And now, we got an opportunity
to tie this ballgame

35:18.886 --> 35:20.503
with just one extra point.

35:20.537 --> 35:23.042
Dillon's gonna be thrilled
to get out of here with a tie.

35:23.106 --> 35:25.030
Saracen, get in here.

35:25.077 --> 35:27.433
Turn around, son.
What do you see out there?

35:29.965 --> 35:31.473
We got 'em right where we want 'em.

35:31.506 --> 35:33.800
We're gonna go for two.
What do you think?

35:33.907 --> 35:37.403
Give it to Smash.
He's been doing it all game, Coach.

35:39.005 --> 35:42.101
- Coach, we need a play.
- 18 option, Matt. 18 option.

35:42.605 --> 35:44.253
- Do you understand that play?
- Yes, sir.

35:44.355 --> 35:45.703
- You got the play, you understand?
- Yes, sir.

35:45.775 --> 35:46.402
Get 'er done.

35:47.006 --> 35:47.970
Well, I don't know if I like this.

35:48.005 --> 35:50.633
But Coach Taylor has Saracen
back in the game.

35:50.698 --> 35:53.803
And it looks like they're gonna be going
for the two-point conversion and the win.

35:58.806 --> 36:00.372
You are looking at a man

36:00.406 --> 36:04.073
who is betting his entire career
on this one play.

36:07.677 --> 36:09.601
Green, 20!

36:10.948 --> 36:11.831
Hut!

36:17.638 --> 36:19.773
Williams takes the pitch.
Heads up the right side.

36:20.206 --> 36:22.403
He gets airborne--
Oh, he takes a lick at the goal line.

36:22.678 --> 36:24.031
Did he make it?

36:25.507 --> 36:27.500
It's good! It's good!

36:27.836 --> 36:30.203
Smash Williams has scored
on a two-point conversion

36:30.235 --> 36:33.900
and the Dillon Panthers
have taken this game.

36:34.335 --> 36:36.931
- Damn fine game, Coach.
- Just doin' my job.

36:37.905 --> 36:41.103
I can't believe Coach T would've put
the whole season on the line,

36:41.207 --> 36:42.903
but boy, that was a beautiful call!

36:43.006 --> 36:45.450
I'll tell you what,
Coach Taylor rolled the dice

36:45.508 --> 36:48.235
- and he came up a big winner this time.
- Coach, good luck for the season.

36:48.235 --> 36:50.200
- That was a fine game.
- Thank you, sir.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.242
Connor?

37:41.776 --> 37:43.440
Connor?

37:52.807 --> 37:53.903
Hi.

37:54.047 --> 37:56.400
- Morning.
- Morning.

37:57.105 --> 37:58.902
Breakfast.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.672
Someone should enlighten
this town about room service.

38:06.977 --> 38:09.200
It looks like it's just
for one person.

38:09.448 --> 38:11.740
Yeah, well, I gotta
catch my plane.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.572
- Right, right.
- You knew I was...

38:14.907 --> 38:17.101
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

38:20.547 --> 38:23.203
You know, Tyra...

38:23.576 --> 38:25.503
you're a really great girl.

38:25.775 --> 38:27.900
- And, um...
- Please, just...

38:28.648 --> 38:30.941
Don't.

38:38.447 --> 38:41.302
Look, I have to be honest
with you, Tyra.

38:42.246 --> 38:43.471
I'm involved.

38:44.008 --> 38:47.473
You know, in L.A.
I'm, I'm in a pretty serious--

38:47.576 --> 38:49.200
- Relationship?
- Yeah.

38:49.277 --> 38:50.342
Yeah, well...

38:50.477 --> 38:53.743
you know, this was just
a one-time thing.

38:53.796 --> 38:56.203
- And I have a boyfriend, so...
- Right.

38:59.205 --> 39:01.072
Yeah.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.672
Okay, well...

39:05.706 --> 39:08.303
- I really have to, um...
- Right.

39:10.078 --> 39:11.502
So I'll see you soon?

39:12.007 --> 39:13.571
- Yeah.
- Ok.

39:14.576 --> 39:15.673
Bye.

39:34.507 --> 39:37.740
<i>Let's get out of this country</i>

39:38.177 --> 39:41.142
I wanna get those, um, those
chocolate-covered blackberries.

39:41.347 --> 39:42.970
- That sounds good.
- All right.

39:43.005 --> 39:43.940
Hey!

39:43.978 --> 39:46.042
Hey, you know what I like about me?

39:46.108 --> 39:48.473
That you're married to somebody
as fantastic as me?

39:48.507 --> 39:49.801
That is what I like about me.

39:49.847 --> 39:51.443
- Good morning, cheerful.
- Hey, thank you for doing that.

39:51.478 --> 39:53.770
Tonight, what do you say
we go grab some dinner?

39:53.805 --> 39:56.041
- Uh-huh, I like that.
- Catch a movie.

39:56.778 --> 39:59.201
- And then we'll do the...
- Oh, really?

39:59.546 --> 40:00.540
Okay, okay!

40:00.578 --> 40:03.300
Wait, wait, wait!
Inappropriate. Inappropriate.

40:03.377 --> 40:06.040
- Eating breakfast.
- We're gonna get down tonight.

40:07.048 --> 40:09.273
I'll see you after
the meeting this afternoon.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.800
- Good-bye. I love you.
- Tell Buddy Garrity,

40:12.897 --> 40:15.003
uh, he can shove it.

40:15.576 --> 40:19.941
<i>Find a cathedral city, You can
be handsome, I'll be pretty</i>

40:25.175 --> 40:29.141
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

40:29.177 --> 40:30.906
<i>Everyone else thinks
it's the bee's knees</i>

40:30.906 --> 40:35.373
I'll tell you what. Eric Taylor coached
a hell of a game last night.

40:35.455 --> 40:38.200
Those Arnett Mead boys had
a tremendous size advantage

40:38.307 --> 40:42.902
over our Panthers. And he just ran
those Tigers flat into the ground.

40:42.945 --> 40:45.443
- Hey, you're a hero,man.
- Well, my hat's off to Coach Taylor.

40:45.478 --> 40:49.603
And young Matt Saracen has really emerged
as a force to be reckoned with.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.171
That was a hell of a performance.

40:54.377 --> 40:56.500
Hey, Jeff, how are you doing today?

40:56.545 --> 40:58.270
I appreciate that, thank you.

40:58.306 --> 41:01.303
- Hey, good one. Good one.
- Thank you.

41:01.747 --> 41:06.242
<i>Smell the Jasmine,
my head will turn</i>

41:06.378 --> 41:09.372
<i>Feel like gettin'
confessional</i>

41:09.407 --> 41:11.402
<i>We'll find a cathedral city</i>

41:11.447 --> 41:15.602
<i>You can convince me
I am pretty</i>

41:20.385 --> 41:23.412
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

41:23.867 --> 41:27.351
<i>Everyone else thinks
it's the bee's knees</i>

41:27.567 --> 41:30.361
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

41:31.205 --> 41:33.902
<i>I just can't see</i>

41:33.937 --> 41:38.901
<i>I just can't see</i>

41:58.537 --> 42:02.602
Coach Taylor, a couple of gentlemen
I'd like for you to meet here.

42:02.735 --> 42:03.862
Buddy.
It's, um..

42:03.907 --> 42:05.860
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

42:05.936 --> 42:08.761
Lance Jennings. Ryan Johnson.
Nice to meet you.

42:08.808 --> 42:11.731
We're from the district executive committee.

42:12.368 --> 42:15.200
Some questions have arisen
about Ray Tatom's eligibility.

42:16.035 --> 42:19.663
And I thought we had this
all squared away, Coach.

42:21.007 --> 42:22.200
I thought we did too.

42:22.236 --> 42:25.500
Well, we're here to inform you that
there's gonna be a formal investigation.

42:25.908 --> 42:27.830
And we'll notify you
of our findings.

42:27.865 --> 42:29.762
Your "findings."

42:30.936 --> 42:33.602
And if he is deemed ineligible...

42:33.637 --> 42:35.730
Ray Tatom won't be playing
football here anymore.

42:36.268 --> 42:39.833
And Dillon will be stripped
of last night's victory.

42:45.337 --> 42:48.202
Well, y'all have a good day.
Buddy, I'll talk to you later.

42:48.205 --> 42:50.002
Yeah, I'll talk to you later, Coach.
