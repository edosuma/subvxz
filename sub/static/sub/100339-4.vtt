MAN BREATHES HEAVILY

Suppose I'm lucky you've still
got time for backgammon.

00:08.369 --> 00:11.650
Well, who knows how long before
your evenings are filled with...

00:11.689 --> 00:12.689
other activities.

00:17.929 --> 00:19.330
WOMEN GASP

00:20.850 --> 00:25.130
Your mortal soul...or filling
a space on the parish council?

00:25.170 --> 00:27.770
You can have my soul first.

00:29.610 --> 00:31.409
What?! Bloody hell!

00:31.450 --> 00:34.730
Hey, come on, Geordie. It's just
a bit of fun. OK? Rag week stuff.

00:34.770 --> 00:37.289
Cos there was that fella
who did the...

00:37.329 --> 00:39.929
Yeah.
One law for the rich.

00:39.969 --> 00:42.130
Oh, and how do you know he's rich?
The clothes?

00:42.170 --> 00:43.810
One law for the clever.

00:47.929 --> 00:51.690

01:02.090 --> 01:03.970
Where's your lovely ring?

01:04.009 --> 01:05.649
Gone to a better home.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.130
There can't be a better home
than yours, Mrs C.

01:09.530 --> 01:13.729
Is this about the incident?
The brick through the window?

01:13.770 --> 01:15.369
I'll thank you not to talk about it.

01:15.410 --> 01:18.410
It wasn't
a judgment from God.

01:18.449 --> 01:21.050
It was a horrible
violation.

01:21.089 --> 01:22.490
After something
like that,

01:22.530 --> 01:25.289
it's all the more important
you look after yourself.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.250
Give yourself a treat.

01:27.289 --> 01:30.449
"I pray that women adorn themselves
in modest apparel,

01:30.490 --> 01:33.250
"with shamefacedness and sobriety,

01:33.289 --> 01:35.530
"not costly array."

01:35.569 --> 01:39.490
Sometimes, I wish St Paul hadn't
written quite so many letters!

01:39.530 --> 01:43.890
And don't you think
God just wants us to be happy?

01:43.929 --> 01:46.449
God wants us to be good Christians.

01:46.490 --> 01:49.530
Where on earth does it say in
the Bible he wants us to be happy?

01:59.569 --> 02:00.929
I'm impressed.

02:00.970 --> 02:03.490
I'm not very impressed with myself.

02:03.530 --> 02:05.130
Only you would think that.

02:05.169 --> 02:07.649
Oh, I bet the bishop would
if he knew about it.

02:09.049 --> 02:10.690
I can't keep leaning on you, Vic.

02:10.729 --> 02:14.729
Who else you got? Well,
apart from the big fella upstairs.

02:14.769 --> 02:18.449
I was with Ellie.
Nearly let myself down.

02:18.489 --> 02:20.489
Come on, Will, you're only human!

02:20.530 --> 02:23.009
I have to be better than that.
You are better than that!

02:23.049 --> 02:25.289
"Nearly let yourself down,"
you said.

02:25.329 --> 02:27.690
So, rather than giving yourself
a hard time,

02:27.729 --> 02:29.410
give yourself a pat on the back.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.810
And a good stretch
wouldn't go amiss either.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.930
Ooh! Another cheerful face(!)

02:36.650 --> 02:38.850
They've found a body on the fens.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.930
He's naked.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.930
It's him.

02:55.130 --> 02:57.370
"A bit of fun"?

03:02.329 --> 03:06.210
You print that, I'll make sure
you never get a story again.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.250
What have you got for me then?

03:08.289 --> 03:10.530
What do you want?
Cause of death?

03:10.569 --> 03:12.850
As it rained half the night
and he's stark-bollock naked,

03:12.889 --> 03:14.850
I'd say exposure
was a pretty good guess.

03:14.889 --> 03:16.810
So off you trot.

03:16.850 --> 03:18.169
Well?

03:19.410 --> 03:20.489
Got a name?

03:22.169 --> 03:24.370
I was just about to check the tags
on his socks(!)

03:24.410 --> 03:27.769
I got a story yesterday about a
student running naked through town,

03:27.810 --> 03:30.370
shouting that aliens had landed.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.530
Put this in your paper...

03:32.569 --> 03:36.370
"The aliens are helping police
with their investigation."

03:36.410 --> 03:38.289
My source also gave me a name.

03:39.329 --> 03:41.690
That's enough. Let's move on.
All right.

03:41.729 --> 03:43.609
All right.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.410
Give me the name and this one'll
fill you in later over a pint.

03:47.449 --> 03:51.650
Supper. At the vicarage.
Nice and cosy.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.569
I can't. We have evensong.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.729
You have to eat, don't you?

03:55.769 --> 03:58.650
And she only really comes alive
after sunset.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.690
Chris Hartley, Trinity Hall.

04:04.729 --> 04:08.210
So, when you were a student, you
were naked all the time, were you?

04:08.250 --> 04:11.210
Just high days and holidays.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.650
Will the Conqueror. Good job
our paths didn't cross back then.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.329
Bloody Ellie.

04:21.488 --> 04:23.489
GEORDIE SIGHS

04:25.049 --> 04:27.689
God, what a mess.
Did he do this?

04:29.249 --> 04:31.530
Well, the bedder said the bed
was unslept in.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.369
She didn't say the place
had been turned over!

04:34.410 --> 04:37.410
So, someone's been here since.
What were they looking for?

04:37.450 --> 04:39.090
Well, if they found it easily,

04:39.129 --> 04:41.650
they wouldn't have had to make
such a mess.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.570
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:53.729 --> 04:55.890
You said you wanted anything
from the postmortem?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.929
Mm.
Only...there isn't anything.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.970
No alcohol in his system.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.650
Well, last movements...

05:05.689 --> 05:07.809
Who's "M.L."?

05:07.850 --> 05:10.049
Get a list of names of people
at the college.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.090
Guv.

05:12.890 --> 05:14.410
What?

05:14.450 --> 05:15.809
It could be Master's Lodge.

05:15.850 --> 05:18.890
Now, why didn't you think of that,
hmm?

05:18.929 --> 05:20.330
Come on.

05:21.929 --> 05:24.850
Obviously we want to help
in whatever way we can.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.289
It's not him, is it? It's not Chris?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.970
My wife, Dr Munroe.

05:32.010 --> 05:35.049
Dr Munroe. I'm afraid it is.

05:35.090 --> 05:36.489
SHE GASPS

05:36.530 --> 05:38.890
Judy, go and have a lie down.
How can I?!

05:38.929 --> 05:41.169
Please.
Before you do...

05:41.210 --> 05:44.609
Could I ask if Chris saw
either of you here yesterday?

05:44.650 --> 05:47.770
I was expecting him,
but he didn't show up.

05:47.809 --> 05:50.609
Oh. What was the purpose
of his visit?

05:50.650 --> 05:52.570
My wife is a Fellow in Psychology
at Girton.

05:52.609 --> 05:54.770
Chris Hartley
was studying psychology.

05:54.809 --> 05:57.970
Chris asked my advice on essays
and life and...

05:58.010 --> 06:00.249
Oh, God, his father, he's visiting,
he won't know yet.

06:00.289 --> 06:02.890
Douglas, this is all my fault...
Judy!

06:02.929 --> 06:05.729
I should have done more to talk him
out of it. He trusted me.

06:05.770 --> 06:08.169
Talk him out of what?
My wife is distressed.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.489
I must insist...
You said you wanted to help.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.049
Talk him out of what?

06:13.530 --> 06:16.090
Adler's trial.
Which is?

06:16.129 --> 06:20.689
Martin Adler is Professor
of Experimental Psychology

06:20.729 --> 06:22.450
and esteemed Fellow of this college.

06:22.489 --> 06:26.489
Esteemed?! Look what that esteem
has done for Chris Hartley.

06:26.530 --> 06:29.570
Chris is on a trial Professor Adler
is running,

06:29.609 --> 06:33.330
studying the effects
of a new chemical on psychotherapy.

06:33.369 --> 06:35.330
It's extremely dangerous,
a psychotomimetic.

06:35.369 --> 06:39.010
Imagine I didn't go to Cambridge...

06:39.049 --> 06:44.129
It works by replicating the effects
of psychosis.

06:44.169 --> 06:45.570
It makes people mad.

06:46.850 --> 06:49.809
A chemical that makes people mad.
That's just what the world needs(!)

06:49.850 --> 06:54.369
Lysergic acid diethylamide.
LSD for short.

06:58.369 --> 07:01.410
A father should never
have to do this.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.570
I don't understand.

07:06.609 --> 07:10.169
What was he doing out in that state?

07:11.609 --> 07:13.729
He's such a timid lad.

07:15.090 --> 07:17.049
We have an avenue of enquiry.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.609
Mr Hartley...

07:21.650 --> 07:24.609
Was there any particular reason you
decided to visit Chris this week?

07:25.650 --> 07:27.169
I'm on my own.

07:28.770 --> 07:31.850
He's all I've got.

07:31.890 --> 07:35.369
It's just him...and me.

07:37.410 --> 07:39.770
HE CRIES

07:43.820 --> 07:48.579
LSD is a miracle of modern science.

07:48.620 --> 07:52.860
It helps the analysand remember
things they've shut away

07:52.899 --> 07:56.899
and gain insights they might not
achieve with years of therapy.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.779
That's not how Dr Munroe
describes it.

07:59.820 --> 08:02.300
Ah, well, the Master's wife
is limited in her thinking

08:02.339 --> 08:04.219
and perhaps more than
a little irritated

08:04.260 --> 08:07.940
that I got funding for my research
and she didn't.

08:07.979 --> 08:10.740
It's a psycho...
Psychotomimetic.

08:10.779 --> 08:12.060
It drives people mad.

08:12.099 --> 08:16.300
I've used LSD on myself to no ill
effects. Quite the opposite. It's...

08:17.539 --> 08:19.300
It's God in a bottle.

08:19.339 --> 08:21.820
All those things men used to look
to religion for,

08:21.860 --> 08:25.779
we can now understand and cure with
psychotherapy and psychedelics.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.979
Christianity isn't just a tool
to make you feel better.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.180
It's the truth.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.578
You might want to talk
to someone about that.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.179
I could recommend a very good
psychotherapist.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.419
Maybe for you, it's God in a bottle,

08:38.458 --> 08:41.020
but for Chris Hartley,
it was delusions and death.

08:41.059 --> 08:45.579
That could never have been LSD. My
research requires just tiny amounts.

08:45.619 --> 08:50.099
My subjects leave as sober,
as normal as your or I.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.420
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yes?

08:52.780 --> 08:55.940
Ah, Remi! I'll be five minutes...
Actually, no, no, come in. Come in.

08:55.979 --> 08:58.180
Remi here, he's on the trial.

08:58.219 --> 09:02.459
Remi, could you explain to my
visitors? Does LSD make you mad?

09:02.499 --> 09:04.339
Mad?!

09:04.379 --> 09:07.420
It makes me feel at peace.
One with the world.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.579
And afterwards?

09:09.619 --> 09:15.979
Afterwards, you feel like your
old self, only with more insight.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.219
You heard about Chris Hartley?

09:18.259 --> 09:20.660
Abducted by aliens.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.420
He ran out to the fens naked
and now he's dead.

09:23.459 --> 09:25.219
Any idea why?

09:30.739 --> 09:32.940
Thank you, Remi. Five minutes.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.579
You said you just administer
tiny drops.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.660
DOOR CLOSES

09:39.700 --> 09:41.660
Is it possible Chris
had more than he should?

09:41.700 --> 09:44.420
I keep it under lock and key.

09:48.259 --> 09:49.579
KEYS JANGLE

09:56.540 --> 09:58.780
Exactly as it was
yesterday morning.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.900
Where do you get it from?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.459
Lovely!
Hi.

10:07.499 --> 10:09.339
Enjoy your plate!

10:09.379 --> 10:11.979
Mum, what are you doing?

10:12.020 --> 10:15.379
You can't sell this stuff,
it's precious!

10:15.420 --> 10:17.660
I can hardly run the house
on the pittance

10:17.700 --> 10:19.140
you and Geordie put in the pot!

10:19.180 --> 10:23.379
And you need to get rid of junk,
so, two birds, one stone!

10:23.420 --> 10:25.940
Take it all back inside
before Geordie sees it.

10:25.979 --> 10:27.420
You know your problem, Cathy?

10:27.459 --> 10:29.780
You've never known a good thing
when you see it.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.739
Whereas old rubbish,
you think is marvellous!

10:32.780 --> 10:36.499
Oh! Now look what you've made me do!

10:36.540 --> 10:39.459
I'm only making it
to Professor Adler's demand.

10:39.499 --> 10:42.619
We're not storing gallons
of the stuff.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.540
Is it complicated?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.579
Could someone make it
in their kitchen?

10:48.619 --> 10:50.859
If they had first-rate
lab equipment

10:50.900 --> 10:54.180
and a doctorate
in Organic Chemistry.

10:54.219 --> 10:57.180
I'm pretty sure we're the only
people in England making this.

10:57.219 --> 10:59.579
Just going for a cigarette.
Thank you.

11:03.259 --> 11:04.940
You're a friend of Remi's?

11:06.180 --> 11:08.900
No. Who's Remi?

11:08.940 --> 11:11.060
You row in the same boat.

11:13.499 --> 11:15.459
What's your name, son?

11:15.499 --> 11:16.700
Peter Soosai.

11:16.739 --> 11:19.900
Well, Peter,
Remi's told us everything.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.859
So don't make it worse for yourself
by lying.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.219
Tell us about the LSD.

11:25.259 --> 11:28.820
He wanted his own supply.
Gave me five pounds to make it.

11:28.859 --> 11:32.339
Who am I to stand in the way
of a fellow student's research?

11:34.420 --> 11:37.180
We wanted to try the acid
with each other.

11:37.219 --> 11:39.060
Not in Adler's study.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.219
A shared experience.

11:41.259 --> 11:43.219
This is a university education?

11:43.259 --> 11:44.579
Go on.

11:44.619 --> 11:47.180
We were going to do it this weekend.

11:48.619 --> 11:53.459
But, after I heard about Chris
running around the town naked...

11:53.499 --> 11:57.180
I went and looked for the vial
under his bed.

11:57.219 --> 11:58.499
And, did you find it?

11:58.540 --> 12:00.140
It wasn't there.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.339
I looked everywhere.
We noticed(!)

12:02.379 --> 12:04.900
Getting the scholarship
to study here...

12:05.940 --> 12:09.780
..it's the best thing that's ever
happened to me and my family.

12:09.820 --> 12:12.259
If I got sent down...

12:12.300 --> 12:14.540
I thought if I could just get
the vial back...

12:14.579 --> 12:16.579
Am I in trouble?

12:18.140 --> 12:21.459
Thing is, Remi, and it pains me
to say this...

12:21.499 --> 12:25.180
apart from briefly obstructing
my investigation...

12:25.219 --> 12:26.259
no.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.020
You haven't done anything illegal.

12:28.060 --> 12:29.540
HE SIGHS

12:42.859 --> 12:45.700

will flee away."

12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
That's the Jews, getting to Israel.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.499
What the dickens has that got to do
with us?

12:57.700 --> 13:02.140
No, no, Mum's fine!

13:02.180 --> 13:05.300
Yeah, it's been wonderful
having her, actually.

13:05.339 --> 13:07.499
It's just we're bursting
at the seams

13:07.540 --> 13:09.259
and I think she feels in the way.

13:10.660 --> 13:13.619
I tried Jeannie.
She already said no.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.900
And Barbara.

13:16.940 --> 13:19.099
Margie, please!

13:29.060 --> 13:32.979
Sad as I am not to throw the book
at that smug Professor Adler...

13:34.339 --> 13:36.140
..I think everyone's off the hook.

13:37.739 --> 13:38.739
Mm.

13:40.099 --> 13:41.739
Except for us, maybe.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.619
Timid.
That's what his dad called him.

13:44.660 --> 13:48.619
Now, why would a timid boy down
a whole vial of a psychedelic?

13:49.820 --> 13:51.379
To get over his timidity?

13:51.420 --> 13:53.099
Do you know this?

13:53.140 --> 13:55.300
I'm still halfway through
From Russia With Love.

13:55.339 --> 13:58.020
It's Aldous Huxley's account
of his experience with mescaline.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.420
A cactus derivative with
mind-altering properties.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.420
Why don't I write a book?

14:04.459 --> 14:07.099
"What it feels like after drinking
five pints."

14:07.140 --> 14:09.379
Look at Chris's notes.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.579
They're all fearful.

14:11.619 --> 14:14.499
"How can he know he'll get back
to normal? Is he mad?"

14:14.540 --> 14:17.060
Judy Munroe said Chris came to her
for advice

14:17.099 --> 14:19.259
about whether he should
even do the trial or not.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.339
He just...doesn't sound like
the type to do it on his own.

14:22.379 --> 14:24.540
Maybe he wrote all this
before he started

14:24.579 --> 14:26.540
and then he found
he really liked it.

14:26.579 --> 14:28.820
That's how it works with drugs.

14:28.859 --> 14:29.859
You get hooked.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.780
Based on your vast experience
with tobacco?

14:32.820 --> 14:35.499
Mm.
OK, maybe he did,

14:35.540 --> 14:38.579
but don't you think we should
at least ask the girlfriend?

14:41.660 --> 14:45.060
This is my doing. I'm to blame.

14:45.099 --> 14:47.259
He didn't want to do the trial.
I talked him into it.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.979
You're on Adler's trial?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.420
And were you part of the merry band

14:54.459 --> 14:57.060
planning to have your own
private party at the weekend?

14:59.459 --> 15:02.020
Do you know Remi's supply
has gone missing?

15:02.060 --> 15:04.060
What? I don't understand.

15:04.099 --> 15:08.859
We think Chris took it
and, well, took it.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.859
Chris? No.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.180
No, he wouldn't do that.

15:12.219 --> 15:15.339
He was scared about doing it outside
the trial.

15:15.379 --> 15:17.660
Really?

15:17.700 --> 15:20.219
Are you sure he hadn't got the taste
for it?

15:20.259 --> 15:24.259
He was getting a lot out of the work
he was doing with Professor Adler,

15:24.300 --> 15:26.499
but it left him feeling fragile.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.700
He wasn't sure about mucking around.

15:28.739 --> 15:32.619
I told him it would be good for him.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.339
This LSD...

15:36.379 --> 15:37.739
How strong is the taste?

15:37.780 --> 15:39.499
It doesn't taste of anything.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.619
Helen! I'm so sorry.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.540
They think he could have been
drugged.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.060
Who else knew you had the vial?

15:55.099 --> 15:57.339
Just the four of us.

15:57.379 --> 15:59.300
Chris, me, Helen and Peter.

15:59.339 --> 16:02.379
Peter didn't know where you were
hiding it. He just supplied you.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.739
He's the expert.
He told me how to store it.

16:05.780 --> 16:09.060
And he was going to take it
with us.

16:09.099 --> 16:14.739
Peter wouldn't wish any harm
to Chris, Remi, he wouldn't.

16:14.780 --> 16:17.459
He liked Helen.

16:17.499 --> 16:20.619
He wasn't happy that Chris had beat
him to it.

16:20.660 --> 16:23.020
This is ridiculous.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.940
This whole thing! It's just...
It's just too horrible.

16:25.979 --> 16:29.540
You said Chris would never have
taken it by himself,

16:29.579 --> 16:33.300
which only leaves you two and Peter.

16:33.339 --> 16:35.180
What about the thing that Peter said

16:35.219 --> 16:37.140
after one of the sessions
with Adler?

16:37.180 --> 16:39.780
How is that relevant?
What did he say?

16:42.180 --> 16:44.300
He...

16:44.339 --> 16:47.300
He said that he'd seen the devil.

16:56.619 --> 16:58.099
Mum?

17:06.219 --> 17:09.099
Ooh, something smells nice!
It's coq au vin.

17:09.140 --> 17:12.420
I'll get you a drink
while you get changed.

17:12.459 --> 17:16.459
And borrow my panstick, see if you
can do something about your eyes!

17:16.499 --> 17:18.059
Our guests are arriving shortly.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.979
What guests?
SHE LAUGHS

17:20.019 --> 17:22.140
Why did you lie about the LSD?

17:22.180 --> 17:25.099
I don't want Professor Evans knowing
I'm sampling the produce.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.539
Where's the vial now?

17:26.579 --> 17:30.219
Wherever Chris tossed it,
presumably. Selfish idiot.

17:30.259 --> 17:31.979
He's ruined everything
for all of us now.

17:32.019 --> 17:33.819
You didn't like him much, did you?

17:33.860 --> 17:36.580
That because Helen wanted him
and not you?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.059
Are you trying to pin this on me?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.100
You had motive, opportunity...
And you're right.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.700
I had plenty of opportunity.
I make the stuff.

17:43.739 --> 17:46.100
So, why would I need to steal it
from Remi?

17:46.140 --> 17:49.259
Did you tell anyone else
about the LSD?

17:49.299 --> 17:52.299
I'm not stupid. It's obvious.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.340
Chris took it.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.979
The consensus is that Chris was too
cautious to take it on his own.

17:57.019 --> 18:00.620
I guess the consensus
hasn't seen him blotto on beer!

18:00.660 --> 18:02.819
I don't know what was going on
for Chris

18:02.860 --> 18:04.700
but he was craving
a bit of oblivion.

18:21.769 --> 18:24.130
Oh, I thought that was you.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.769
I hope it's all right,
me being here.

18:25.809 --> 18:27.650
Of course.

18:27.690 --> 18:31.529
There's something I just, um...
I just can't quite grasp.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.489
Maybe I should let Adler give me
a drop of LSD!

18:34.529 --> 18:36.529
Goodness!

18:36.569 --> 18:38.249
Don't do that, please.

18:39.729 --> 18:41.410
Did you know Chris?

18:41.450 --> 18:42.450
No.

18:43.850 --> 18:47.410
I only ask because grief...or guilt

18:47.450 --> 18:51.489
can make us look for some kind
of explanation when there is none.

18:51.529 --> 18:54.450
I do feel guilty.

18:54.489 --> 18:56.969
I saw Chris running naked through
the town.

18:57.009 --> 19:00.289
Inspector Keating
wanted to arrest him.

19:00.330 --> 19:03.090
But I persuaded him
to leave Chris to it.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.049
Really, you did nothing wrong.

19:07.529 --> 19:09.650
You were being kind.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.090
Thank you.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.729
It's a funny thing, guilt.

19:16.969 --> 19:18.569
It's often misplaced.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.930
We feel guilty
about the little things

19:20.969 --> 19:23.370
because we can't face up
to the big ones.

19:25.450 --> 19:28.209
I killed my father.
Exactly.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.450
I didn't exactly plunge a knife
into his heart, but, um...

19:33.489 --> 19:35.610
Well, it's complicated.

19:37.289 --> 19:39.049
It usually is.

19:40.330 --> 19:43.249
If you like, I could arrange for you
to speak to someone?

19:43.289 --> 19:45.450
There's someone I speak to
every day.

19:45.489 --> 19:47.249
Oh.

19:47.289 --> 19:48.729
God.

19:49.890 --> 19:53.529
Well, this wouldn't be instead
of that. It could be as well as.

19:54.809 --> 19:57.890
Adler seems to think that belief
in God is a mental disorder.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.330
Adler believes in God.
It's just he believes he is God.

20:06.450 --> 20:08.370
How troubled was Chris?

20:10.529 --> 20:13.769
His mother walked out on him
when he was young.

20:13.809 --> 20:17.850
I know he'd been quite upset
recently, he'd had a trip home,

20:17.890 --> 20:20.569
and that's why his father's
visiting.

20:21.610 --> 20:24.090
He should never have been
on that trial.

20:24.130 --> 20:28.330
But is Adler feeling guilty?
No, he is not.

20:32.249 --> 20:36.450
Here he is! Home is the sailor,
home from the sea

20:36.489 --> 20:38.489
and the hunter home from the hill.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.610
SHE CHUCKLES

20:39.650 --> 20:41.249
What's going on?

20:41.289 --> 20:43.009
She's invited the Lawsons.

20:43.049 --> 20:46.650
The Lawsons? We haven't spoken
to them in five years!

20:46.690 --> 20:48.850
I know. You go down the pub,
I'll manage it.

20:48.890 --> 20:51.769
No! Don't want to waste a good meal.

20:51.809 --> 20:54.170
..Esme and I were sisters,
didn't he, Esme?

20:54.209 --> 20:56.090
I was lucky to have you there
as chaperone!

20:56.130 --> 20:57.930
Blimey! How much did this cost?

20:57.969 --> 20:59.489
Oh, you must forgive my son-in-law.

20:59.529 --> 21:01.850
I'd say it was the strain of having
four children

21:01.890 --> 21:04.569
but it was just the same at
their wedding, if memory serves.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.370
As long as you're paying for this
and all.

21:06.410 --> 21:08.569
Do you speak Italian?
Er, no.

21:08.610 --> 21:09.529
Niente.

21:09.569 --> 21:13.090
I think one should if one
wants to be truly cultured,

21:13.130 --> 21:15.610
now that the war's over
and all that.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.209
Oh! Oh, I've just had
the most marvellous idea!

21:18.249 --> 21:22.170
Let's ask the funny little man who
sells the ice creams to teach us!

21:22.209 --> 21:24.850
Lessons for the whole street!

21:24.890 --> 21:26.850
Oh, won't that be fun!

21:26.890 --> 21:30.450
Then we can put on an opera!
Oh, Mum, really.

21:30.489 --> 21:31.809
Well, why not?

21:31.850 --> 21:35.209
Can't all be industrial unrest
and long faces!

21:35.249 --> 21:38.850
You know? Tutti van Frutti,
what about that?

21:38.890 --> 21:41.450
Oh, you just made that up!
It's an ice cream.

21:41.489 --> 21:43.769
Isn't this fun? Ooh!

21:43.809 --> 21:46.690
SHE SINGS OPERATICALLY

21:51.330 --> 21:53.170
I'm relieved it's not aliens.

21:53.209 --> 21:56.610
That might pose some rather
challenging theological questions.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.569
I'm not sure LSD doesn't.
Visions, revelations,

21:59.610 --> 22:01.930
I mean, suddenly everyone's a saint
or prophet.

22:01.969 --> 22:03.850
You make me want to try it!

22:03.890 --> 22:06.769
I hope you'll content yourself
with shepherd's pie instead.

22:06.809 --> 22:09.370
I'm sure this is equally magical.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.769
DOG WHINES

22:11.809 --> 22:14.450
I've always been scared
of psychologists.

22:14.489 --> 22:18.009
There was a boy at my school,
two years above.

22:18.049 --> 22:21.769
Everyone thought
he was going to be head boy,

22:21.809 --> 22:27.130
but, well, suddenly he was seeing
a psychologist,

22:27.170 --> 22:31.489
then it was electric shocks,
injections.

22:31.529 --> 22:34.729
In the end, he threw himself
off the roof of the hospital.

22:34.769 --> 22:38.569
Why ever did they make the poor boy
see a psychologist?

22:42.009 --> 22:45.690
Let's think of happy things,
shall we?

22:45.729 --> 22:48.450
This is the day the Lord has made.

22:48.489 --> 22:51.170
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

22:51.209 --> 22:54.809
Rejoice in his creation.
Not what we do to defile it.

22:54.850 --> 22:58.249
You would have made a wonderful
theologian, Mrs C.

22:58.289 --> 23:02.489
Anyway, that's Psalms.
There's a lot of nonsense in Psalms.

23:07.130 --> 23:10.690
Oh, the Gold Coast! It sounds like
something out of a fairy tale!

23:10.729 --> 23:12.090
Diana!

23:13.450 --> 23:16.090
It's a lovely tea, but we're going
to call it a night.

23:16.130 --> 23:18.729
It's not over yet!
Oh, it's late, Mum.

23:18.769 --> 23:21.410
But there's pudding!
We've just had it.

23:21.450 --> 23:24.890
No, no, no, no. That was just
a little palate cleanser before...

23:24.930 --> 23:27.729
# Do-do-do-do-do-do-doooo! #

23:27.769 --> 23:31.690
What's got into her?
First chance to entertain for ages!

23:31.729 --> 23:35.930
You go up. I'll sort this lot out.
You, hop it.

23:35.969 --> 23:37.330
Oh, bloody hell.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.130
Bed! The lot of you.

23:39.170 --> 23:41.969
The lights, the lights! Lights!

23:42.009 --> 23:43.930
Here we are!

23:43.969 --> 23:45.569
SHE LAUGHS

23:48.690 --> 23:50.090
FLAMES WHOOSH

23:53.170 --> 23:56.529
Whoa! Diana!
What are you doing?!

23:56.569 --> 23:58.690
Geordie!

23:58.729 --> 24:00.890
Oh, oh!

24:00.930 --> 24:02.170
DIANA LAUGHS

24:03.529 --> 24:05.769
Oh! What fun!

24:09.330 --> 24:11.009
Alone at last.

24:13.450 --> 24:15.890
I, um...

24:15.930 --> 24:19.969
I wanted to say that I'm sorry about
what happened the other night.

24:20.009 --> 24:23.049
I should hope so too,
running off like that!

24:24.090 --> 24:25.769
I meant what came first.

24:26.890 --> 24:29.690
Well, I'm sorry you're sorry.

24:29.729 --> 24:34.209
It's not that I don't like you.
I do, obviously.

24:34.249 --> 24:37.289
It's just that it's wrong for me
to behave like that.

24:37.330 --> 24:40.729
And it's not just me.
It's the Church.

24:40.769 --> 24:42.890
Bringing in the big guns.

24:42.930 --> 24:45.450
What are you going to do next?
Throw holy water over me?

24:45.489 --> 24:49.769
You know my situation.
It's been clear from the day we met.

24:49.809 --> 24:54.330
Actually, Will, it gets less and
less clear the longer I know you.

24:54.370 --> 24:57.330
I'm not sure you even know
what you want.

25:10.930 --> 25:12.890
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, Will!

25:12.930 --> 25:15.450
You can't keep doing this!
It's humiliating.

25:15.489 --> 25:17.890
I know.
I mean for me.

25:23.610 --> 25:26.769
Why give the newspaper
Chris Hartley's name?

25:26.809 --> 25:28.610
Was it about humiliating him?

25:28.650 --> 25:31.289
This? Now? Really?!

25:31.330 --> 25:32.930
Who tipped you off?

25:32.969 --> 25:34.890
I'm not going to reveal my sources.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.930
Was it an anonymous call?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.969
As it happens...

25:39.009 --> 25:41.170
And what about the voice?
Old, young?

25:42.569 --> 25:45.769
Well spoken. Possibly female.

25:53.650 --> 25:56.249
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

25:56.289 --> 25:59.249
You know the only thing that could
have made tonight any better?

25:59.289 --> 26:01.769
Apart from the Lawsons
being a bit more sparkling

26:01.809 --> 26:04.289
and you keeping your elbows
off the table?

26:04.330 --> 26:05.569
A serving hatch!

26:05.610 --> 26:08.130
Diana. Diana!

26:08.170 --> 26:09.729
SHE EXCLAIMS

26:09.769 --> 26:11.450
You need help.

26:11.489 --> 26:13.289
Geordie's right, Mum.

26:13.330 --> 26:16.049
This is man's work.

26:17.370 --> 26:18.690
You deserve a rest.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.450
Come on.

26:34.930 --> 26:37.930
What the hell was that?
Oh, she's just tired.

26:39.009 --> 26:43.209
Is she on drugs?
Drugs?! No! No.

26:43.249 --> 26:47.009
Mum's always had these
ups and downs.

26:47.049 --> 26:48.890
This is Mum having an up.

26:48.930 --> 26:51.090
No. We all have ups and downs,
Cathy.

26:53.450 --> 26:56.450
Yeah, well,
Mum's ups can last for weeks.

26:58.690 --> 27:01.090
And her downs can last for months.

27:01.130 --> 27:03.410
For God's sake,
why didn't you tell me?

27:04.650 --> 27:06.809
When I was six,

27:06.850 --> 27:11.610
she decided we needed to wash all
the crockery, glassware, everything.

27:11.650 --> 27:16.930
I was drying and she saw a smear
on one of the glasses.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.130
She threw it at my head.

27:19.170 --> 27:23.489
I ducked and it smashed
against the wall.

27:25.009 --> 27:27.850
I'm your husband.
You should have said.

27:27.890 --> 27:32.289
Then she took every glass
and smashed it.

27:33.450 --> 27:37.650
The neighbours all came running in,
saw the wreckage and...

27:38.729 --> 27:40.850
I said...

27:40.890 --> 27:42.850
that it was me.

27:45.729 --> 27:48.330
Because that's what we do.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.170
Bloody hell, Cathy.

27:59.090 --> 28:00.569
Helen.

28:00.610 --> 28:01.890
I was just...

28:04.330 --> 28:06.330
Why won't you talk to me?

28:06.370 --> 28:07.930
I just want to see how you're doing.

28:09.049 --> 28:11.209
Look, were there problems between
you and Chris?

28:11.249 --> 28:12.569
Had he done something to you?

28:12.610 --> 28:14.170
What are you accusing me of?

28:15.850 --> 28:18.729
Chris would never hurt me
and I would never hurt him.

28:21.130 --> 28:24.330
I can't talk to you.
Why not?

28:24.370 --> 28:27.049
Professor Adler has forbidden it.

28:30.890 --> 28:33.009
She belongs in hospital.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.729
They can treat her there.

28:34.769 --> 28:37.969
You know what kind of hospital
they'd put her in.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.809
I won't have it.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.370
She wouldn't have it!

28:41.410 --> 28:44.650
They'd have to drag her out,
kicking and screaming.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.610
Hey, hey.
I can't!

28:46.650 --> 28:48.650
I can't.

28:50.090 --> 28:53.049
It's my fault. I should have been
keeping an eye on her.

28:53.090 --> 28:55.529
It's not your fault.

28:55.569 --> 28:59.090
I'm quitting Swinnertons.
I can look after her.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.890
Cathy, you can't give up your job.

29:01.930 --> 29:04.209
I will give up what I want.

29:05.330 --> 29:07.090
It's under control.

29:12.130 --> 29:14.289
Why have you asked the students
in your trial

29:14.330 --> 29:17.130
to stop answering questions?
What is it you're trying to hide?

29:17.170 --> 29:21.769
Hide?! I am simply trying to protect
them, myself and my colleagues

29:21.809 --> 29:23.410
from this kind of nonsense.

29:29.009 --> 29:31.529
If we get to the truth,
then all this will be corrected.

29:31.569 --> 29:35.209
Truth. Who wants that these days?
I do.

29:35.249 --> 29:37.969
Says the man who believes
in resurrection.

29:38.009 --> 29:42.049
Remi Adeyemi, Helen Goldman,
Peter Soosai and Chris Hartley

29:42.090 --> 29:43.610
secured their own supply of LSD.

29:43.650 --> 29:47.049
One of them gave Chris enough
to make him go crazy.

29:47.090 --> 29:50.969
Now you know these students, you've
heard their innermost secrets.

29:51.009 --> 29:52.930
Which of them
would want to hurt Chris?

29:52.969 --> 29:55.769
For me, the interesting question

29:55.809 --> 30:00.690
is what neurosis leads a vicar to
imagine he's some kind of detective?

30:02.489 --> 30:07.049
What is shared between a patient
and his therapist is confidential.

30:07.090 --> 30:10.769
This is your chance to exonerate
your research.

30:12.930 --> 30:17.130
See, I am not kidding when I say
LSD is a wonder drug.

30:18.170 --> 30:20.610
The stuff it dredged up
for Hartley...

30:20.650 --> 30:23.330
Was it too much too soon?
I don't know.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.569
Are you going to tell me
what it was?

30:26.610 --> 30:28.529
No.

30:28.569 --> 30:30.249
I'll show you.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.969
'CHRIS GASPS

30:36.850 --> 30:38.809
'I'm... I'm in my childhood bedroom.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.809
'Everything's in colour.

30:42.850 --> 30:45.769
'It's the night Mum left.
They're rowing.

30:45.809 --> 30:47.330
'She's...

30:48.969 --> 30:51.090
'They don't know we're here.

30:52.569 --> 30:55.090
'Daddy, Daddy, stop. Daddy, stop!

30:56.170 --> 30:57.850
'Daddy, stop! Stop.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.170
'His hands are round her neck.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.690
'She's all red, she can't breathe.
She can't breathe!'

31:09.930 --> 31:12.690
CHRIS CRIES

31:12.729 --> 31:15.969
'He killed her!'

31:24.694 --> 31:26.934
So, you're saying while he was high
on drugs,

31:26.975 --> 31:30.174
Chris had this memory
of his dad killing his mum?

31:30.215 --> 31:32.455
You'd think it's something
he'd remember!

31:32.495 --> 31:34.975
Oh, the mind's a funny thing.

31:35.015 --> 31:38.295
He's dead now. He won't make much
of a witness, even if it were true.

31:38.334 --> 31:40.654
The Master's wife told me Chris
had been home recently.

31:40.694 --> 31:43.735
Let's say Chris confronted his
father about what he'd remembered

31:43.775 --> 31:45.575
and maybe things ended badly.

31:45.614 --> 31:48.894
So, Chris's father comes to college
to try and ensure his son's silence.

31:48.934 --> 31:51.094
Mr Hartley didn't know
about the LSD.

31:51.134 --> 31:52.815
Maybe he did.

31:55.374 --> 31:57.694
No father is going to poison
their own son.

31:57.735 --> 31:59.654
Er, Ivan the Terrible, Goebbels.

31:59.694 --> 32:02.495
Anyway, he didn't necessarily
mean to kill him.

32:02.535 --> 32:05.094
Once you've got someone
running through town naked,

32:05.134 --> 32:08.414
screaming about aliens, who's
going to believe a word you say?

32:12.174 --> 32:16.614
What do I do with all of these?
I don't even understand the titles.

32:19.694 --> 32:21.694
The day he got into this place...

32:25.735 --> 32:28.775
Something's come up while we were
looking into your son's death

32:28.815 --> 32:30.575
and I need to ask you
some questions.

32:30.614 --> 32:34.614
Apparently Chris had recently
recalled seeing an incident...

32:35.735 --> 32:38.094
..between you and his mother.

32:41.495 --> 32:43.894
I didn't even know he'd seen it.

32:45.614 --> 32:50.295
Not until last week, when he came
to visit and accused me of...

32:52.854 --> 32:54.495
She was leaving us.

32:54.535 --> 32:57.975
She'd been carrying on with
a Canadian airman

32:58.015 --> 32:59.975
and now she was off.

33:01.455 --> 33:04.575
I said she couldn't just
up and leave - what about Chris?

33:06.174 --> 33:08.455
I tried to stop her.

33:09.815 --> 33:12.255
Yes, it got physical, but...

33:12.295 --> 33:14.174
I'm no killer.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.654
I did lie to him.

33:20.495 --> 33:22.815
I told him she'd gone to Canada.

33:24.854 --> 33:26.495
She's in Bedford.

33:27.854 --> 33:29.975
Two sons and a daughter.

33:32.374 --> 33:35.815
Never so much as sent Chris
a birthday card.

33:37.654 --> 33:39.654
So, that's why you visited?

33:39.694 --> 33:41.854
To tell him the truth?

33:41.894 --> 33:44.694
I thought it was better than him
thinking the worst of me.

33:44.735 --> 33:47.735
But, now... Oh!

33:53.975 --> 33:56.895
You know what? I feel guilty.

33:56.935 --> 34:00.774
Not just because I've added to
a grieving man's burden,

34:00.814 --> 34:03.495
but because I've created a monster,

34:03.535 --> 34:06.094
desperate for every tragedy to be
a murder.

34:06.134 --> 34:07.774
I'm sorry.

34:07.814 --> 34:10.054
I think I really wanted it to be
the father.

34:11.694 --> 34:13.975
I'm no Freud,
but this is about your own dad.

34:14.014 --> 34:16.614
I don't know what it is you need to
do to sort out,

34:16.654 --> 34:18.534
but I wish you'd hurry up and do it.

34:19.855 --> 34:22.014
We're not all evil, you know.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.455
"Goebbels."

34:31.895 --> 34:34.855
Here you go.
Thanks.

34:39.935 --> 34:41.813
I'm thinking of seeing a therapist.

34:41.855 --> 34:44.895
You know, someone to talk to
about things.

34:44.935 --> 34:47.134
You ever need to talk,
you come here.

34:47.174 --> 34:49.293
And what I'll tell you is

34:49.335 --> 34:52.734
all you need is a little bit
more faith in Will Davenport.

34:52.774 --> 34:56.254
It's all this police work, too much
time around the nasty side of life.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.734
You wanna give yourself a break.

35:00.575 --> 35:01.935
You could be right.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.015
That student on the fens.

35:05.055 --> 35:07.495
His mum left him when he was six.

35:07.535 --> 35:10.415
What sort of woman walks out
on her own son?

35:10.455 --> 35:13.094
What sort of marriage was it
to make her do that?

35:13.134 --> 35:15.015
I look at these couples
I'm marrying,

35:15.055 --> 35:18.774
happiest day of their lives.
And I think, "Just you wait."

35:20.814 --> 35:23.855
I know a lad saw a girl
on Cromer Pier.

35:23.895 --> 35:26.855
Married her a week later.

35:26.895 --> 35:29.694
Two days after that,
he was off to North Africa.

35:29.734 --> 35:31.895
Didn't see her again
for three years.

35:33.055 --> 35:35.174
What a disaster, eh?

35:35.214 --> 35:39.895
Only, here we are, 19 years on,

35:39.935 --> 35:43.214
and there isn't a morning
I don't wake up and think,

35:43.254 --> 35:45.174
"You're the luckiest man alive."

36:05.855 --> 36:08.734
You're not a six-year-old girl
anymore.

36:08.774 --> 36:12.174
But you'll probably always feel like
one when it comes to her,

36:12.214 --> 36:14.375
which is why I can't leave it
up to you.

36:14.415 --> 36:17.975
She needs proper medical help,
Cathy.

36:18.015 --> 36:19.455
It's for your own good and hers.

36:21.174 --> 36:23.734
It's not your responsibility
anymore.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.654
You're too clever for me.

36:44.774 --> 36:48.294
I can't prove that God wants you
to be happy.

36:48.335 --> 36:50.614
I just know I want you to be happy.

36:51.774 --> 36:57.335
How can I be happy? I'm married
to a man I don't even know.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.174
Jack?

36:59.214 --> 37:02.094
He's done terrible things.

37:02.134 --> 37:04.614
Abused his position.

37:04.654 --> 37:07.375
He's a crook.

37:07.415 --> 37:11.254
No better than Ronnie.
That's how clever I am!

37:12.455 --> 37:13.614
Oh!

37:20.094 --> 37:22.455
I've been all over the place
recently and...

37:22.495 --> 37:24.814
I've been finding it hard.

37:24.855 --> 37:27.975
And that's made it hard for you,
which is the last thing I'd want.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.895
But I've just had one of those
everyday miracles

37:31.935 --> 37:34.375
where everything has become clear.

37:36.094 --> 37:37.895
What I want to say is...

37:40.335 --> 37:41.855
..is will you marry me?

37:46.055 --> 37:50.814
Oh, God, you're serious!
No, Will, that is not the answer!

37:50.855 --> 37:53.015
We don't even know each other.
We do!

37:53.055 --> 37:57.495
I know that you're smart, funny,
ambitious, good with people.

37:57.535 --> 37:59.375
I know you well enough to know

37:59.415 --> 38:02.214
I want to spend the rest of my life
getting to know you better.

38:02.254 --> 38:04.814
I'm sorry, but this just isn't part
of my plan.

38:04.855 --> 38:07.214
It wasn't part of my plan!
Plans change.

38:07.254 --> 38:09.575
I'm not going to commit to something
I don't want,

38:09.614 --> 38:12.214
just to help you get over
this thing you have about sex.

38:12.254 --> 38:14.935
"This thing" is my faith.

38:16.214 --> 38:18.575
It's just one reason why
it's never going to work.

38:18.614 --> 38:20.335
I'm sorry.

38:27.694 --> 38:29.335
I'm, er...

38:29.375 --> 38:32.694
I'm inviting that nice vicar
you work with to dinner next week.

38:32.734 --> 38:35.214
Diana, you have to go.

38:35.254 --> 38:36.254
Oh!

38:39.375 --> 38:43.734
I am not some piece of rubbish
for you to put out when you please.

38:43.774 --> 38:45.294
You need some help.

38:45.335 --> 38:48.734
Did she put you up to this?
Cathy?

38:49.935 --> 38:51.495
Hardly.

38:55.055 --> 38:57.535
I'll tell you one thing
about your daughter.

38:59.455 --> 39:01.174
She loves to feel guilty.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.174
So, let the burly orderlies
drag you out

39:04.214 --> 39:06.375
and you'll give her exactly
what she wants.

39:06.415 --> 39:10.174
Or, you can walk out with me,
head held high.

39:12.134 --> 39:13.614
She won't know what to do.

39:15.535 --> 39:16.855
Oh.

39:19.335 --> 39:21.694
I'm frightened.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.734
I know.
We just want you to get well.

39:26.814 --> 39:29.935
But if I know one thing about
the women in your family...

39:30.975 --> 39:33.495
..it's that
they're as tough as diamonds.

39:35.015 --> 39:38.094
Now, shall we show the neighbours
just how important you are?

39:58.174 --> 40:00.015
It's all right, love.

40:02.855 --> 40:04.055
Mind your head.

40:05.134 --> 40:07.335
There we are.
VAN DOORS SLAM

40:13.375 --> 40:15.694
ENGINE STARTS

40:24.614 --> 40:26.055
KNOCK AT DOOR

40:26.094 --> 40:27.375
DOOR OPENS

40:27.415 --> 40:31.614
Am I disturbing you?
No. Just, er...

40:31.654 --> 40:35.294
asking God for some
much-needed guidance.

40:35.335 --> 40:36.335
And?

40:37.935 --> 40:40.254
One of those days.

40:40.294 --> 40:42.495
Might I ask you something?

40:47.375 --> 40:51.575
I'm thinking of asking my father
to stay.

40:51.614 --> 40:53.535
Would that be all right?

40:53.575 --> 40:56.535
Your father?
Well, I thought you didn't...

40:56.575 --> 40:58.535
We don't.

40:58.575 --> 41:01.935
Still.
Of course! Good for you.

41:01.975 --> 41:03.174
Why now?

41:04.294 --> 41:08.734
It's Mrs C I have to thank for it,
in a roundabout way.

41:10.094 --> 41:14.294
I've come to think of her
rather as the voice of God.

41:15.214 --> 41:19.415
Just like my father,
but of course she isn't, she's human

41:19.455 --> 41:21.415
and she's terribly unhappy.

41:21.455 --> 41:25.134
Oh, I had no idea.
Is it to do with the attack?

41:25.174 --> 41:28.055
Yes and no.

41:30.134 --> 41:33.375
It's Jack
and the source of his wealth.

41:33.415 --> 41:35.935
Ill-gotten gains.

41:35.975 --> 41:39.935
She's furious with him
and...herself.

41:42.975 --> 41:46.535
That's it!
Leonard, you are brilliant!

41:59.015 --> 42:03.495
What now?! We're having dinner
at Corpus.

42:04.694 --> 42:05.774
You go on ahead.

42:22.654 --> 42:24.774
It was about money.

42:24.814 --> 42:26.094
Wasn't it?

42:27.134 --> 42:30.654
You were furious funding had been
given to Adler and not to you.

42:30.694 --> 42:33.495
If only you could discredit him.

42:33.535 --> 42:37.575
Chris was nervous about taking LSD
for fun and so, as he always did,

42:37.614 --> 42:40.975
he asked for your advice.
So you knew Remi Adeyemi

42:41.015 --> 42:44.134
had obtained his own supply
and was storing it in Chris's room.

42:44.174 --> 42:47.654
This is absurd! Have you taken
some of Adler's potion?

42:47.694 --> 42:49.575
Did you put it in his tea?

42:49.614 --> 42:52.015
It worked like a dream
when Chris ran naked through town,

42:52.055 --> 42:55.975
raving about aliens.
Easy to make sure the paper knew.

42:56.015 --> 42:58.495
But then it turned into a nightmare.

42:58.535 --> 43:00.495
You understood my feelings of guilt
so well,

43:00.535 --> 43:02.895
not because you're a psychologist,

43:02.935 --> 43:06.495
but because you are feeling
a hundred times more guilty.

43:06.535 --> 43:09.055
This is what I know about guilt.

43:09.094 --> 43:13.455
If you try to keep this secret,
you will drive yourself mad.

43:15.335 --> 43:18.214
I had no idea it would hit him
so hard.

43:18.254 --> 43:22.455
Stupid, dangerous drug.
And you're not off the hook!

43:22.495 --> 43:24.654
Why didn't you stop him
that evening?

43:24.694 --> 43:28.094
And Adler should never have been
allowed to start that research.

43:40.614 --> 43:44.055
God in a bottle.
Tempted?

43:44.094 --> 43:45.975
Aye, I'll stick to beer.

43:47.335 --> 43:49.174
Are you?

43:49.214 --> 43:51.375
I'm not sure it's the right path
for me.

43:52.575 --> 43:55.975
Quite tempted to slip it into
the communion wine though.

43:56.015 --> 43:58.294
Will Davenport, that would be
a crime and a sin.

44:00.614 --> 44:03.694
Oh, by the way, Chris's mum
is alive and well in Bedford.

44:04.895 --> 44:07.214
I suppose that's
some kind of silver lining.

44:10.495 --> 44:14.455
I think tonight's the night you're
going to beat me at backgammon.

44:14.495 --> 44:16.895
I promised Cathy I'd get back.

44:16.935 --> 44:18.455
Ah.

44:18.495 --> 44:19.495
Yep.

44:30.614 --> 44:33.575
The world is changing so fast.

44:33.614 --> 44:38.015
Each day, science pushes back
the frontiers of our knowledge.

44:38.055 --> 44:44.055
'Out there, the heavens. And in
here, the mysteries of our minds.'

44:44.094 --> 44:47.495
It's easy to wonder, "Where is God?"

44:47.535 --> 44:51.335
But even when we can't perceive him,
never doubt he is there.

44:53.855 --> 44:56.134
'He is there constantly,

44:56.174 --> 44:59.015
'in every act of love...

45:04.895 --> 45:07.055
'..kindness...'

45:07.094 --> 45:08.455
You all right, son?

45:13.055 --> 45:14.455
'..forgiveness.'

45:20.855 --> 45:22.495
'And it's only with God's love

45:22.535 --> 45:25.654
'that we will make this modern age
a world, not of horrors,'

45:25.694 --> 45:27.855
but of wonders.
