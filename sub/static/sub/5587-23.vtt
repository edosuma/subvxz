<i> I was obsessed with</i>
<i> space camp.</i>

00:03.904 --> 00:06.071
<i> Yep, NASA had</i>
<i> an actual summer program</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:08.640
<i> where you got to live</i>
<i> like an astronaut.</i>

00:08.642 --> 00:11.143
<i> Hollywood even made</i>
<i> a</i> SpaceCamp <i> movie</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:12.111
<i> starring a young</i>
<i> Joaquin Phoenix</i>

00:12.113 --> 00:17.316
<i> and a goofy robot</i>
<i> which captured the heart</i>
<i> of the entire nation.</i>

00:17.318 --> 00:18.117

00:18.119 --> 00:19.585

00:19.587 --> 00:20.719
<i> Well, it captured</i>
<i> my heart.</i>

00:20.721 --> 00:23.789
Wow! Wasn't that the
most amazing movie
you've ever seen?

00:23.791 --> 00:29.094
Eh, a bunch of kids
getting accidentally
launched into space?

00:29.096 --> 00:30.662
That's asking a lot
of the audience.

00:30.664 --> 00:31.730
It wasn't an accident.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.766

befriends a robot

00:33.768 --> 00:36.502
who gets a NASA computer
to launch them into orbit.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.836
It's based
on a true story.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.372
Yeah, you said the same
thing about <i> Mannequin</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:41.073

00:41.075 --> 00:42.708
Fine! I believe
in the magic of movies!

00:42.710 --> 00:46.812
Doesn't change the fact
that I'm gonna go to the real
space camp someday.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.982
Well, if I were
you, I'd go now,

"too late?"

doesn't exactly scream "cool."

00:56.690 --> 00:57.456
No! You think?

00:57.458 --> 01:00.025
Your dorkiness
is becoming a
tonnage issue,

01:00.027 --> 01:01.226
so, yeah,
I'd rein it in.

01:01.228 --> 01:05.230
Then it's settled!
This summer, I will live out
my dream at space camp,

01:05.232 --> 01:06.465

gonna stop me.

It's the Gyrotron 2000,

the tumble-spin upon
a rocket's re-entry.

just talking about Space Camp?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.609
What an amazing coincidence!
Wait.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.547
You said you needed
sports shoes for
the big athletic game.

05:48.549 --> 05:51.049
And now that I hear myself
say it, I'm an idiot!

05:51.051 --> 05:54.219
The real reason I brought you
here was to witness my dream.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.955
I told you,
no Outer Space Camp.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.024
It's just "Space Camp"!

05:59.026 --> 06:00.792
And once you see
the joy on my face,

06:00.794 --> 06:02.461
you won't be able
to tell me "No."

06:02.463 --> 06:05.397
Trust me.
Your heart will melt.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.331

06:26.120 --> 06:27.519
Think back
to when you were a kid...

06:27.521 --> 06:29.454
you know, pushing a hoop
with a stick

06:29.456 --> 06:31.223
on the way
to the old fishin' hole.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.257

do you think I am?

06:32.259 --> 06:35.594
Point is, you were
a child once,
with hopes and dreams,

06:35.596 --> 06:37.562
just like me.
We're the same.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.663
Nope.
Never had any dreams.

Mm, I didn't.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.701
Wait, you've always
been like this?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.369

06:53.947 --> 06:54.613
It's how he was raised.

06:54.615 --> 06:58.617
Pop-Pop convinced him
that dreams were stupid.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.052
That's it!
I'll go ask Pop-Pop!

07:01.054 --> 07:02.187
He'll know if Dad had
any hopes and dreams.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.992
Wait. You actually
want to go talk to
that bitter old bastard?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.327
You're a braver man
than I am.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.029
For me,
fear isn't an option.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.999
Excuse me, sir. You left
this bag in the dressing room.

07:14.001 --> 07:14.833
Looks like
your old pants?

07:14.835 --> 07:17.469
It's not mine! It belongs
to another small boy!

07:17.471 --> 07:19.838
Go, go, go!
Go, go!

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
It's been a minute.
We're done.

07:21.842 --> 07:22.707

out of your grasp.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.544
The coupon says
"Spoonies with Mama."

07:25.546 --> 07:27.179
It doesn't specify
a time limit.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.013
"One minute" was implied!

07:28.015 --> 07:30.081
Well, you should have
put that in the terms
and restrictions.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.018
I wrote that when I was six!
The world was still new!

07:33.020 --> 07:35.153
Well, why don't we
change that attitude

07:35.155 --> 07:38.557

you write that? Why?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.230
I was 10!
I wanted to go play!

08:18.232 --> 08:20.232
I didn't know
this day would come!

08:20.234 --> 08:20.999
This is too much.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.534
Last night, we went
to an Italian restaurant,

08:22.536 --> 08:26.271
and she made me
"Lady and the Tramp"
a piece of spaghetti.

08:26.273 --> 08:26.972
That's nothing.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.840
This morning,
I gave her a back massage.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.309
Her skin sucked up the lotion
like a biscuit!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.578
Yesterday, I held hands
with her for an hour

08:33.580 --> 08:34.513
as we walked
around the park.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.249
We looked like
a lesbian couple where
she makes the money!

08:37.251 --> 08:39.084
While I'm having
my heels shaved,

08:39.086 --> 08:42.687
why don't we hear about Barry
being a little teapot?

08:42.689 --> 08:45.257
I'm not a little teapot!
I'm a ripped one!

08:45.259 --> 08:47.392
Uh, we're done.
Mother's Day
is officially over.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.695
Sorry, boop. I've still got
a huge stack of coupons left.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.532
Doesn't matter,
'cause they all just expired.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.232
(LAUGHING) Oh!

08:54.234 --> 08:56.701
We both know there's not
a coupon in the world

08:56.703 --> 08:58.036
I can't make the manager
honor.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.572
Well, I am manager,
and I reject your coupons.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.441
Why do you get to be manager?
This isn't fair.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.109
There is no manager.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.411
I demand co-manager,
or I walk!

09:06.413 --> 09:08.480
Whatever! Fine!
We're co-managers!

09:08.482 --> 09:12.417
And my first act as co-manager
will be this.

09:15.422 --> 09:15.921
I see.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.523
So, you're not just ruining
this Mother's Day.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.859
You're taking every other one
away, too.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.628
I'm sorry, but we have
no other choice.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.363
Message received.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.600
I apologize in advance
for what comes next.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.068
¶

09:31.972 --> 09:32.671
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:32.673 --> 09:35.674
Uh, whatever this is,
I don't want it or need it.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.043
It's me...
your grandson.

09:38.045 --> 09:38.577
I know.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.511
The boy
just wanted to know

09:39.513 --> 09:43.014
which of Murray's dreams
you crushed
when he was a child.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.350
Oh! This could be fun.
Come on in.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.453
And that is why
you never trust a Polynesian.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.121
Yeah, I think
we're getting off-topic.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.991
Remember, I came here
about my dad's
childhood dreams.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.727
Aw, that dummy
never had any dreams.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.495
Are you sure?
Wait.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.599
Come to think of it,
that dummy had a dummy.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.501
There's the dummy's dummy.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.135
What the...

10:04.137 --> 10:06.237
Dad wanted to be
a ventriloquist?

10:06.239 --> 10:08.773
He loved this stupid
wooden piece of crap.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.242
Luckily, I told him
to stop being a jackass

10:11.244 --> 10:12.611
and go out and get a job.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.379
Stupid 9-year-old kid.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.447
Whoa.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.015
Can I have this,
Pop-Pop?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.850
No way! I use that
in the carpool lane.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.686
Come on, Ben.
It'd mean a lot to Adam.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.355
How much is a lot?
$200?

10:23.357 --> 10:25.991
Are you trying to shake down
your own grandchild?

10:25.993 --> 10:26.758
He looks
like he eats good.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.528
It's a small price to pay
to give Dad his dream
so I can get mine.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.496
Fine.
I'll take care of it.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.132
That was a discount price
for the kid.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.433
For you, it's $300.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.401
Well, that's fair.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.604
Let me just reach
in my wallet, and...

10:39.606 --> 10:40.672
Go grab the doll
and go.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.907
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

10:42.909 --> 10:45.210
You're lucky I was too cheap
to have hip surgery,

10:45.212 --> 10:47.812
or I'd be
running after ya!

10:48.682 --> 10:54.152
<i> It was the morning</i>
<i> after Barry and Erica trashed</i>
<i> their Mother's Day coupons.</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:56.721
<i> My mom had yet to retaliate...</i>

10:56.723 --> 10:58.390
<i> until now.</i>

11:00.594 --> 11:02.227
What the...

11:02.229 --> 11:03.795
ERICA: What the...

11:04.264 --> 11:04.796
My things!

11:04.798 --> 11:07.332
Your things?
What about my things?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.167
Mom, come quick!
We got robbed!

11:09.169 --> 11:11.002
We need to get
the FBI on this!

11:11.004 --> 11:11.903
They took
my hockey stick!

11:11.905 --> 11:14.272
And...And some things
from under my mattress!

11:14.274 --> 11:16.641
Your things aren't stolen,
schmoopers.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.143
I just took them all back.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.110
What are you saying
right now?

11:19.112 --> 11:22.313
You took away
a lifetime of gifts from me.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.315
It's only fair
I do the same.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.684
You can't do this!

11:25.686 --> 11:29.220
I need my Samurai sword
and my California Raisins

11:29.222 --> 11:30.689
and my dancing cola friend!

11:30.691 --> 11:32.057
They're what makes me me!

11:32.059 --> 11:33.692
You mean this guy?

11:34.161 --> 11:36.027
He dances for me now.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.696
Shake it, cola man!

11:37.698 --> 11:38.263
This is nuts.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.732
Who takes revenge
for something
horrible done to them?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.901
You know what?
Keep our stuff!

11:42.903 --> 11:45.136
I'm not giving in
to your crazy demands

11:45.138 --> 11:46.971
of respect
and decent treatment!

11:46.973 --> 11:50.208
And I can live without
my special dancing cola friend

11:50.210 --> 11:52.010
no problem.
Just you watch!

11:52.012 --> 11:54.846
<i> That day, Erica and Barry</i>
<i> weren't the only ones</i>

11:54.848 --> 11:55.747
<i> refusing to back down.</i>

11:55.749 --> 11:56.981
Hey, Dad.
I have an amazing...

11:56.983 --> 11:59.984
Uhp, uhp! I'm watching
the channel guide
to see what's on at 8:00.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.620
I already missed it once,
and it's about
to come 'round again.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.657
This can't wait!
It's that important!

12:05.659 --> 12:06.825
Oh, damn it!

12:06.827 --> 12:07.959
I missed it again!

12:07.961 --> 12:09.661
This is the worst day
of my life!

12:09.663 --> 12:12.464
Well, it's about to get
a lot better.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.200
I don't know
what that is.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.702
Stop! I know
all about the dummy.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.970
Pop-Pop told me
everything.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.140
Fine! The dummy is mine.
Are you happy?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.509
I got that stupid thing
when I was a kid.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.078
But...why does it
look like you now?

12:27.080 --> 12:27.946
Now?
That's how I looked.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.583
Admit it! You had dreams,
like every other kid
in this world.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.451
Come on. Put your hand
in your old friend.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.120
I will not put my hand
in my friend.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.488
Do it!
Feel your dream again!

12:36.490 --> 12:37.789
Why is this happening
to me?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.125
Put your hand
right on in there!

12:40.127 --> 12:40.892
Stop saying that!

12:40.894 --> 12:42.927
Murray,
what's the big deal?

12:42.929 --> 12:46.064
Jam your fist
up your old pal.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.432
It'll feel nice.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.533
I see what this is.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.068
You're trying to prove
I had dreams

12:50.070 --> 12:52.070
to let you go
on your stupid space trip.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.039
Wha... Me?
How dare you, sir!

12:55.041 --> 12:56.875
Okay, everyone calm down.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.577
Tell you what.
I'll send him to Space Camp.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.647
No way, Al!
You're not
sending him anywhere.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.548
Understood.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.150
I'm sending you.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.452
Stop undermining me!
I'm the father!

13:07.454 --> 13:08.820
It's my job
to keep his head

13:08.822 --> 13:12.657
out of the clouds
and down here on Earth!

13:13.560 --> 13:16.327
Don't worry, buddy.
I got your back.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.796
No, you don't!

13:18.165 --> 13:19.931
That, he hears.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.732
<i> I'd struck out again,</i>

13:20.734 --> 13:23.268
<i> and while my mom had struck</i>
<i> Barry and Erica's closets,</i>

13:23.270 --> 13:25.770
<i> they protested</i>
<i> by getting creative.</i>

13:25.772 --> 13:27.939
Morning.
Mama made pancakes.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.641
(CHUCKLES)
For Lainey, not you.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.010
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> their protest didn't work.</i>

13:32.012 --> 13:34.979
Um, you sure you guys
don't want to go
upstairs and change?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.482
You know, since you look like
insane drifters?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.050
This is
the look of freedom.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.452
Mom thinks she won
by taking my stuff.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.487
Well,
I made my own dress,

13:42.489 --> 13:43.721
like Molly Ringwald
in <i> Pretty in Pink.</i>

13:43.723 --> 13:47.258
Only, instead of a cute
pink dress, it's a trash bag.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.426
So convenient.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.561
(SCOFFS)

13:49.563 --> 13:50.161
(LAUGHS)

13:50.163 --> 13:52.831
We are supposed to be
on the same team! Do better!

13:52.833 --> 13:55.667
I don't get it.
Your mom's amazing.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.802
Her pancakes
have these crispy edges.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.971
(SCOFFS) It gets old
real quick.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.506
You're not here.
You don't know.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.740
I'm actually around a lot.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.008
I'm literally here
right now.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.376
Look, I know
she can be intense,

14:05.378 --> 14:07.111
but if you guys
want your stuff back,

14:07.113 --> 14:08.680
you got to step up
in a big way.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.683
<i> And that meant one thing.</i>
<i> shedding their garbage clothes</i>

14:11.685 --> 14:13.885
<i> and performing</i>
<i> a lame, half-assed love song.</i>

14:13.887 --> 14:16.387
(RAPPING)
<i> ¶ Mom, Mom, she is the bomb</i>

14:16.389 --> 14:18.890
<i> ¶ She puts the "Viet"</i>
<i> up in the 'nam</i>

14:18.892 --> 14:21.259
<i> ¶ Mom makes me sammies</i>
<i> full of salam</i>

14:21.261 --> 14:23.628
<i> ¶ "Mom" spelled backwards,</i>
<i> it still spell "Mom"</i>

14:23.630 --> 14:25.630
<i> ¶ Other words like that</i>
<i> are "racecar" and "noon"</i>

14:25.632 --> 14:29.601
<i> ¶ We don't need</i>
<i> our things back,</i>
<i> but we'd like 'em back soon ¶</i>

14:29.603 --> 14:30.001
Hit it!

14:30.003 --> 14:32.203
<i> ¶ Mothers and daughters</i>
<i> and mothers of daughters</i>

14:32.205 --> 14:35.206
<i> ¶ Mothers are mothers</i>
<i> and mothers of daughters...¶</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:37.175
Blah, blah, blah.
It's a work in progress.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.244
But what do you think?

14:40.146 --> 14:40.945
Fine.
Fine?

14:40.947 --> 14:43.214
Why aren't you
attacking us with
unwanted physical affection?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.384
Yeah, and I reached into
the depths of my soul

14:46.386 --> 14:47.585
to write you that song.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.087
You wrote that song
for your father

14:49.089 --> 14:51.856
when you wanted
to go on a ski trip.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.791
I did not...

14:54.160 --> 14:55.827
know you knew about that.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.428
Unbelievable.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.499
I give you my everything
364 days a year.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.834
Is it too much to ask

15:02.836 --> 15:06.137
to have one day
where you do something for me?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.373
¶

15:09.442 --> 15:10.608
And your lyrics
are terrible.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.243
<i> As my mom gave up</i>
<i> on Smother's Day,</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:16.014
<i> I was going full throttle</i>
<i> to get me some Space Camp.</i>

15:16.016 --> 15:17.215
Moron.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.783
¶

15:18.785 --> 15:20.151
Moron!

15:20.153 --> 15:21.719
¶

15:22.389 --> 15:23.788
Moron.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.991
Not you, Lucky.
You get cheese!

15:26.993 --> 15:28.559
¶

15:29.095 --> 15:30.728
Okay,
I see what you're doing.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.263
You're leaving Maury
around

15:32.265 --> 15:34.666
so I'll fall
back in love with him

15:34.668 --> 15:36.000
and change my mind.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.136
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maury?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.204
Yeah.
Murray and Maury.

15:40.206 --> 15:40.872
You named him Maury?

15:40.874 --> 15:43.241
We were a twin act.
I was the funny one.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.309
Then embrace it.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.343
I will not embrace it!

15:45.345 --> 15:47.211
Let your dream come alive
in your hands!

15:47.213 --> 15:49.480
These hands will be part
of no dream.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.582
Just do it once.
Let me meet Maury.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.250
You want to meet Maury?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.619
Fine!
I want to meet Maury!

15:54.621 --> 15:56.387
Meet Maury.

15:56.856 --> 15:57.689
Hey, I'm Maury.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.257
I'm a colossal
waste of time,

15:59.259 --> 16:01.326
just like a camp
for spaceships,

16:01.328 --> 16:02.927
which is even dumber
than me.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.929
Okay, you are
incredibly gifted at that,

16:04.931 --> 16:07.332
but also incredibly wrong
about Space Camp.

16:07.334 --> 16:11.436
Am I? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
