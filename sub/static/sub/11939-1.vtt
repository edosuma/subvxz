Hanner: SEE? THAT'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

01:28:29.605 --> 01:28:32.375
I MADE 300 MILLION
LAST YEAR, AND IT ONLY
COST ME 50 GRAND.

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:33.776
EXCUSE ME.

01:28:33.776 --> 01:28:35.944
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE
WORD WITH YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:39.482
THE E.P.A.--THEY'VE
NEVER BEEN VERY GOOD

01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:40.749
AT PUNISHING CRIMINALS,

01:28:40.749 --> 01:28:42.618
CATCHING THEM,
HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:28:42.618 --> 01:28:44.820
I'VE GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.321
I QUIT THE E.P.A,

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.623
AND I QUIT THE E.P.A.

01:28:47.623 --> 01:28:49.692
SO I COULD SPEND
MY EVERY WAKING MOMENT

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.326
TRYING TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.629
WE PLAYED THIS ONE
BY YOUR RULES,

01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:56.532
AND YOUR COURT
DECIDED I WAS CLEAN.

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:59.968
YOU'RE VIOLATING
MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:04.373
MR. HANNER, I PROMISE
YOU AS SURE AS YOU
STAND HERE NOW,

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:08.877
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
NEW MEANING TO
THE WORD "VIOLATION."

01:29:24.259 --> 01:29:25.661
HOW YOU DOING,
CHICK?

01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:27.663
HEY, JACK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:29.665
DIDN'T EXPECT
YOU TO BE UP HERE.
WHAT'S UP?

01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:32.568
I THINK I KNOW WHY
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE ME HERE.

01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:36.371
YOU SET UP FRANK,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.508
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:29:39.508 --> 01:29:41.143
I MEAN, IF IT
WEREN'T FOR YOU,

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:42.645
THEY'D HAVE
NEVER FOUND HIM.

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:45.681
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:47.750
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:50.085
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE HELD--

01:29:50.085 --> 01:29:52.721
YOU CAN'T
ARREST ME, JACK.
I OUTRANK YOU.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:54.289
WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?

01:29:54.289 --> 01:29:56.124
I WAS GOING TO ASK
YOU THE SAME THING.

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.162
YOU'RE
A PIECE OF SHIT,

01:30:00.162 --> 01:30:02.097
AND I'M ASHAMED
OF YOU.

01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:03.298
HOOK HIM UP.

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:04.767
YES, SIR.
LET'S GO.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:22.585
* NOW, WHEN I WAS
YOUNG BOY *

01:30:22.585 --> 01:30:24.920
* MY MOTHER
SAID TO ME... *

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.954
Orin: HEY!

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:27.089
HEY!

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.491
WHAT?

01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:30.192
COME OVER HERE.
HOLD THIS BAG.

01:30:30.192 --> 01:30:32.060
WHY? IT AIN'T
GOING NOWHERE.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.062
JUST HEEL, DAMN IT.

01:30:35.464 --> 01:30:36.732
HEY, ORIN.

01:30:36.732 --> 01:30:38.467
LEAN INTO IT MORE--

01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:39.735
THIS THIS.

01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:42.070
Taggert: JUNIOR!
COME HERE, BOY.

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:43.939
I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.007
OH, NO.

01:30:47.142 --> 01:30:49.745
Orin: WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF? THAT'S JUST
MR. FEDERAL AGENT MAN.

01:30:49.745 --> 01:30:52.615
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO--ARREST ME
FOR 10 MINUTES, TOO?

01:30:52.615 --> 01:30:54.583
COME HERE, BOY.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:55.884
NO. YOU COME HERE.

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:57.620
DON'T HIDE BEHIND
THAT BIG OLD PIMPLE.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.756
YOU JUST GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT ON ME.

01:31:00.756 --> 01:31:02.758
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE
QUITE A BIT ON YOU,

01:31:02.758 --> 01:31:05.093
BUT, YOU SEE, OUR
CURRENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:08.130
WOULD NOT PROVIDE
ADEQUATE PUNISHMENT
FOR YOU,

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:10.766
AND I THINK YOU REALLY
DESERVE TO SUFFER.

01:31:10.766 --> 01:31:12.200
SINCE I'M
FEELING SELFISH,

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.770
I'VE ARRANGED FOR A WAY
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:16.772
YOU BETTER LEAVE
MY FRIEND ALONE,

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.907
OR I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO PROPERLY EDUCATE YOU

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:21.777
ON HOW TO BEAT THE SHIT
OUT OF SOMEBODY.

01:31:21.777 --> 01:31:24.613
MATTER OF FACT,
YOU MUST BE
A DUMB MOTHERFUCKER,

01:31:24.613 --> 01:31:26.849
OR YOU WOULDN'T STILL
BE STANDING THERE.

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:29.284
HE'S GOING TO WHIP YOUR ASS
LIKE YOU'RE A RENTED MULE.

01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:30.519
[MEN CHUCKLING]

01:31:30.519 --> 01:31:31.920
HE'S GOING TO
SLAP YOU

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.256
LIKE A RED-HEADED
STEPCHILD.

01:31:34.256 --> 01:31:35.658
I'VE BEEN
ALL OVER APPALACHIA.

01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:37.425
I MET LOTS OF
REALLY FINE PEOPLE.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.795
I'VE NEVER MET ANY
PEOPLE LIKE YOU GUYS.

01:31:39.795 --> 01:31:41.764
YOU GUYS
ARE REALLY UNIQUE.

01:31:41.764 --> 01:31:44.800
YOU'VE BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH
THE IGNORANT PEOPLE.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.201
WELL, SEE,
WE'RE EDUCATED.

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:48.937
I GUESS
EDUCATION CAN'T
BUY COMMON SENSE.

01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:51.707
I THINK, JUNIOR,
IF YOUR DADDY KNEW
HOW STUPID YOU WERE,

01:31:51.707 --> 01:31:53.542
HE'D TRADE YOU IN
FOR A PET MONKEY.

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:55.010
RRARGH!

01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:57.980
GO! GO!

01:32:02.184 --> 01:32:03.719
GO! GET HIM--NOW!

01:32:06.822 --> 01:32:09.491
AAH! MY NOSE!
MY NOSE!

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:11.426
Man: COME ON,
DO SOMETHING!

01:32:11.426 --> 01:32:13.428
HELP HIM OUT!
BEAT THE TAR OUT OF HIM!

01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:14.863
GET IN THERE, BOY!

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:17.065
YOU GOT TO HAVE
MORE THAN THAT, SON.

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.646
COME HERE, BOY.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

01:32:33.982 --> 01:32:37.185
NOW'S THE TIME FOR YOU
TO STEP UP AND BE A MAN.

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:40.288
COME ON. YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME NOW, HUH?

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.456
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:42.991
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:44.860
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.863
YOU KNOW THE THINGS
YOUR FATHER'S DOING HERE
AIN'T NO GOOD.

01:32:47.863 --> 01:32:49.865
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE.

01:32:49.865 --> 01:32:51.266
NOW, YOU CAN DO THAT

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:54.402
JUST 'CAUSE
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YOUR ASS,

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:57.606
OR YOU CAN DO IT
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

01:32:57.606 --> 01:32:59.474
I DON'T REALLY
GIVE A SHIT,

01:32:59.474 --> 01:33:01.276
BUT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IT.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:05.814
YES, SIR.

01:33:13.622 --> 01:33:15.357
Woman:
COME ON, BABY!

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:28.937
* I WAS DEALIN'
UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAY *

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:32.908
* TILL THEY CAUGHT ME
WITH A HEAVY LOAD *

01:33:32.908 --> 01:33:36.178
* THEY SENTENCED ME
TO HARD LABOR *

01:33:36.178 --> 01:33:39.614
* WORKING ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD *

01:33:40.783 --> 01:33:44.152
* NOW, I DON'T DENY
I WAS GUILTY *

01:33:44.152 --> 01:33:47.389
* AND I KNOW
I BROKE THE LAW *

01:33:47.389 --> 01:33:50.793
* I WAS HUNGRY AND BROKE
AND COULDN'T SEE NO HOPE *

01:33:50.793 --> 01:33:54.930
* AND MY BACK
WAS UP AGAINST THE WALL *

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:56.264
* NOW I'M... *

01:33:56.264 --> 01:33:58.466
IS THERE SOME
SORT OF A PROBLEM,
MR. TAGGERT?

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:01.804
YEAH, WELL, UM,
THERE'S A PROBLEM
FOR ORIN HANNER.

01:34:01.804 --> 01:34:03.972
I'VE GOT A WARRANT
FOR HIS ARREST.

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:06.875
I REALLY DON'T CARE
IF YOU'VE GOT
STONE TABLETS FROM GOD.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.043
THIS IS A PRIVATE PARTY.

01:34:08.043 --> 01:34:09.611
SIR, YOU REALIZE
THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT

01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:12.080
TO EFFECT THIS ARREST
BY WHATEVER MEANS
ARE NECESSARY,

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.682
AND YOU ARE
OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE.

01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:17.886
WELL, USE OF FORCE
WILL ONLY ADD MILLIONS
TO THE LAWSUIT, SIR.

01:34:18.921 --> 01:34:19.822
OHH!

01:34:19.822 --> 01:34:21.757
NOW YOU CAN SUE ME.

01:34:30.265 --> 01:34:33.769
* YEAH! *

01:34:33.769 --> 01:34:35.337
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.372
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
STICK AROUND.

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:40.042
OUR NEXT SHOW WILL BE
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.316
SOME PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:49.451
Man: WHO?

01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:50.886
JUST SOME DUMB COP.

01:34:50.886 --> 01:34:54.456
I GOT $1,000 SAYS
HE'S ON THE GROUND
IN 30 SECONDS.

01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:56.091
I'LL TAKE THAT BET.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.862
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:34:59.862 --> 01:35:01.997
I HAVE A WARRANT
FOR THE ARREST
OF ORIN HANNER,

01:35:01.997 --> 01:35:03.732
AND I NEED TO SERVE
THAT WARRANT.

01:35:03.732 --> 01:35:04.867
I'M SURE HE'S
RIGHT BACK THERE.

01:35:04.867 --> 01:35:07.235
I LET YOU IN,
I LOSE MY JOB.

01:35:07.235 --> 01:35:10.272
THAT WOULD BE BETTER
THAN LOSING YOUR TEETH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:35:11.606 --> 01:35:13.876
Man: HOLD ON,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

01:35:13.876 --> 01:35:15.878
JOHN-BOY IS CONFUSED.

01:35:15.878 --> 01:35:17.880
WHAT HE'S
TRYING TO SAY IS

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.983
YOU CAN TAKE THAT WARRANT
AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS.

01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:26.621
SIR, YOU'RE OBSTRUCTING--

01:35:26.621 --> 01:35:28.290
STEP BACK.
STEP BACK.

01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:29.892
UHH!

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.106
Man: OPEN THE DOOR.
OPEN IT UP!

01:35:50.512 --> 01:35:51.847
HOWDY, ORIN.

01:35:51.847 --> 01:35:54.382
HIYA, JACK.
HAVE A SEAT.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.022
CAN I GET YOU
A DRINK?

01:36:00.022 --> 01:36:02.490
I DON'T DRINK MUCH.

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.259
CALL ME.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.661
I HAVEN'T MET YOU,

01:36:06.661 --> 01:36:09.064
BUT I'M SURE YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

01:36:09.064 --> 01:36:12.134
ORIN, GOOD LUCK WITH
THIS INCREDIBLY LARGE FELLOW.

01:36:12.134 --> 01:36:13.235
HA HA!

01:36:16.004 --> 01:36:18.740
WE'RE IN A...
UNIQUE SITUATION HERE.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:22.644
NOW, I REALIZE THAT
THE E.P.A. WASN'T ABLE
TO PUT YOU AWAY.

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:25.547
BY THE WAY,
I WAS JUST KIDDING WHEN
I TOLD YOU I RESIGNED.

01:36:25.547 --> 01:36:26.849
I'M STILL
AN ACTIVE AGENT.

01:36:26.849 --> 01:36:28.416
THESE TWO GENTLEMEN
ARE WITH THE F.B.I.

01:36:28.416 --> 01:36:31.086
THEY CAME TO HELP ME
SERVE THIS WARRANT.

01:36:31.086 --> 01:36:33.889
YOUR SON PROVIDED US
WITH ENOUGH EVIDENCE

01:36:33.889 --> 01:36:36.224
TO STACK UP
A LOT OF YEARS.

01:36:36.224 --> 01:36:39.027
MY SON'S A REAL
DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME.

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:40.963
WE'VE GOT YOU
ON EXTORTION,

01:36:40.963 --> 01:36:43.231
CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT MURDER,

01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:44.967
MURDER,
AND RACKETEERING.

01:36:44.967 --> 01:36:46.969
WE'RE TALKING
30 YEARS.

01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:48.236
THAT'S...
THAT'S UGLY.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.939
THAT'S A LONG TIME
TO GO WITHOUT A WOMAN.

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:53.208
YOU KNOW, I KNEW YOU
WERE GOING TO SAY THAT.

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:56.711
I HAVE A DEAR FRIEND
NAMED TYRONE
THAT HAS PROMISED ME

01:36:56.711 --> 01:36:58.380
THAT, UH,
WHEN YOU HIT PRISON,

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.582
HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU
UNDER HIS WING

01:37:00.582 --> 01:37:03.718
AND TEACH YOU
THE MOST INTIMATE
SOCIAL GRACES OF PRISON,

01:37:03.718 --> 01:37:05.854
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN GOOD HANDS.

01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:07.990
SO YOU WON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:37:09.858 --> 01:37:12.527
WELL, THAT TAKES CARE
OF THE WOMAN THING,

01:37:12.527 --> 01:37:15.463
BUT YOU'RE TALKING
TO A 60-YEAR OLD MAN.

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:18.700
THAT STILL MEANS
I'D PROBABLY DIE
IN PRISON...

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.535
OR WISH TO GOD
I HAD HAVE.

01:37:20.535 --> 01:37:23.471
UNLESS YOU LIVE
TO BE A VERY,
VERY OLD MAN.

01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:28.210
SO I GUESS,
UH, THAT MAKES
KILLING YOU FREE.

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:30.378
WELL, IT WOULD BE FREE
IF YOU COULD.

01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:35.717
THAT'S FAST.

01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:36.885
HOOK HIM UP.

01:37:36.885 --> 01:37:38.586
I GOT HIM.

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:40.388
THAT'S REAL FAST.

01:37:40.388 --> 01:37:42.958
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR--

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:55.637
Taggert: AGENT DOWN.
GET ME AN AMBULANCE.

01:37:56.905 --> 01:37:58.974
