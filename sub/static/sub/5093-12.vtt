WEBVTT

00:07.865 --> 00:11.217
Boys, hurry up; you're
gonna be late for the bus!

00:11.219 --> 00:13.186
Babe, we're pretty much on fumes
till the end of the month.

00:13.188 --> 00:14.988
Which one of these bills
you want me to pay first?

00:14.990 --> 00:17.807
Well, the gas company's not
gonna ding us for 15 days.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.941
Pay the power bill.

00:18.943 --> 00:20.410
You're a genius.

00:20.412 --> 00:21.611
Remember,
tonight's the night

00:21.613 --> 00:23.479
that me and the boys
are gonna be home late.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.115
Right, the birthday party
or something.

00:26.117 --> 00:27.650
Oh, Scotty Trevino.

00:27.652 --> 00:30.152
Him and 20 of his closest
buddies I got.

00:30.154 --> 00:31.187
An arcade,

00:31.189 --> 00:33.206
then burgers
and a movie.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.257
Good luck.

00:34.259 --> 00:35.591
Thank you.

00:35.593 --> 00:37.493
And you remember what you're
doing after work, right?

00:37.495 --> 00:39.262
Yeah, coming home, drink a beer

00:39.264 --> 00:40.296
and watch TV.

00:40.298 --> 00:42.632
Uh, no, you got to go to, uh,

00:42.634 --> 00:44.166
here.

00:44.168 --> 00:45.518
Wojcik...

00:45.520 --> 00:47.353
Wojcik Polish Bakery.

00:47.355 --> 00:49.305
Yeah, we used to go there
as kids when my old man

00:49.307 --> 00:50.556
did a stint in the 5-4.
Well, apparently,

00:50.558 --> 00:52.608
their chocolate
cheesecake is amazing.

00:52.610 --> 00:54.677
Okay.
I want to have it for family dinner.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.362
Okay, but family dinner's
not till Sunday, babe.

00:56.364 --> 00:58.364
Why do I have to go get
the cheesecake tonight?

00:58.366 --> 00:59.615
Because they're not
open on Sunday

00:59.617 --> 01:01.350
and they don't take orders
over the phone.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.618
Fine, yeah, all right.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.038
I will go tonight
and then I'm gonna come home,

01:05.040 --> 01:08.023
have a beer, watch TV
in my underwear.

01:08.025 --> 01:09.826
I'll wait for you.

<i>Reagan,</i>

01:14.499 --> 01:15.498
Lansing!

01:15.500 --> 01:17.550
Where are we on
that bodega shooting?

01:17.552 --> 01:18.634
We're nowhere, Sarge.

01:18.636 --> 01:20.035
Couple kids saw
the shooter, but it's

01:20.037 --> 01:22.371
12th Street Boyz territory,
so nobody's talking.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.039
Uh-huh, how about
your hit and run?

01:24.041 --> 01:25.207
That one's even colder.

01:25.209 --> 01:26.642
You know we're
in the business

01:26.644 --> 01:28.010
of closing cases, right?

01:28.012 --> 01:30.379
Come on, you can't be
busting our balls, Sarge.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.598
Well, Chief of D's
just did a number on mine,

01:32.600 --> 01:33.900
so I'm spreading the wealth.

01:33.902 --> 01:35.551
Then you spoke
too soon.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.186
That string of random assaults
in Greenpoint?

01:37.188 --> 01:38.988
We just sweet-talked
victim number four

01:38.990 --> 01:41.107
into explaining
how they're not so random.

01:41.109 --> 01:42.224
Uh-huh, which is?

01:42.226 --> 01:43.693
They're all clients
of a local bookie

01:43.695 --> 01:46.829
named Alan Greer-- the wounds
are sort of a warning to pay up.

01:46.831 --> 01:48.698
So your vic can I.D.
the attacker as Greer?

01:48.700 --> 01:49.665
Well, no,

01:49.667 --> 01:51.167
but apparently he keeps
a very detailed

01:51.169 --> 01:53.336
little black book, so we get
our hands on that book...

01:53.338 --> 01:54.737
You connect him
to all the victims

01:54.739 --> 01:56.672
and get them
to presses charges, too.

01:56.674 --> 01:58.758
Wow, you know,
I bet you can't

01:58.760 --> 02:00.009
wait till tomorrow, Sarge.

02:00.011 --> 02:00.960
Why's that?

02:00.962 --> 02:02.578
Because you get
smarter every day.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.880
Yeah.

02:03.882 --> 02:06.299
I'll head over to the A.D.A.'s
and try to get

02:06.301 --> 02:08.300
a search warrant
for Greer's place.

02:10.554 --> 02:12.254
What do you mean "no"?

02:12.256 --> 02:13.556
As in "not yes""

02:13.558 --> 02:15.274
Come on, Saul,
this bookie's going around

02:15.276 --> 02:17.894
handing out beat-downs
like it's candy on Halloween.

02:17.896 --> 02:20.095
On the word of a gambling
addict with a head injury.

02:20.097 --> 02:22.482
Yeah, who also says that
this bookie, this guy Greer,

02:22.484 --> 02:23.866
he keeps everything
written down

02:23.868 --> 02:25.651
on a little black book
in his safe.

02:25.653 --> 02:26.869
Come on, we get this book,

02:26.871 --> 02:29.655
we can close five
assault cases at one time.

02:29.657 --> 02:31.207
All right.

02:31.209 --> 02:33.292
But I'm swamped; won't be
till the middle of next week.

02:33.294 --> 02:34.777
Saul, you're a former
cop yourself.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.629
You know I got to
move on this now.

02:36.631 --> 02:37.947
Fine!

02:37.949 --> 02:39.799
Monday. Best I can do.

02:39.801 --> 02:41.584
All right, thank you.

Are you seeing another
A.D.A. behind my back?

02:43.972 --> 02:45.805

everybody thinking

02:45.807 --> 02:47.924
I run to my sister
every time I need something.

02:47.926 --> 02:49.926
Right? They might start
thinking you're smart.

02:49.928 --> 02:51.427
Did you go to
the bakery yet?

02:51.429 --> 02:52.762
How do you know
about that?

02:52.764 --> 02:54.981

09:46.457 --> 09:47.940
talking about
jumping off a roof here.

09:47.942 --> 09:49.241
Linda,

09:49.243 --> 09:50.776
the department has procedures

09:50.778 --> 09:52.328
to handle situations like this.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.445
I believe in them.

09:53.447 --> 09:55.131
Hell, I helped write them.

09:55.133 --> 09:58.283
And because I shouldn't
get involved, I can't.

09:58.285 --> 09:59.952
Danny will be out

09:59.954 --> 10:01.053
on bail in the morning.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.972
So, we are just gonna let him
rot in jail?

10:02.974 --> 10:05.424
Nobody rots
in my jails.

10:05.426 --> 10:08.127
And nobody gets special
treatment, either.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.979
Oh, okay.

10:09.981 --> 10:11.296
Especially from any of us.

10:11.298 --> 10:13.566
Has to be
this way, Linda.

10:13.568 --> 10:16.135
No, it doesn't have
to be this way.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.237
You're a cop;
go find out

10:18.239 --> 10:19.655
who's framing your brother!

10:19.657 --> 10:22.474
And, Erin, I know you probably
can't prosecute this, right?

10:22.476 --> 10:24.076
But can you find out

10:24.078 --> 10:27.780
who is, and-and tell them
that Danny didn't do this?

10:27.782 --> 10:30.666
Of course he didn't do this,
and all of that will come out,

10:30.668 --> 10:32.284
but right now,
our hands are tied.

10:32.286 --> 10:34.370
Linda,

10:34.372 --> 10:36.789
being seen as a dirty cop
is bad enough.

10:36.791 --> 10:39.875
But a dirty cop
from this family,

10:39.877 --> 10:42.261
pulling strings for him?

10:42.263 --> 10:44.964
That could go from bad
to worse in a heartbeat.

10:44.966 --> 10:49.435
There's a line here,
and we walk it every day.

10:49.437 --> 10:52.188
We want this cleared
up just as badly as you do.

10:52.190 --> 10:55.274
But we have to stay out of it.

11:06.019 --> 11:08.204
You want me to represent Danny?

11:08.206 --> 11:12.408
Wise woman once said,
"If you need to hire a shark,

11:12.410 --> 11:14.577
make sure you get
the Great White."

11:14.579 --> 11:15.878
Sounds like Erin.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.363
She used a couple of
other words I won't repeat.

11:18.365 --> 11:20.082
So why isn't she asking me?

11:20.084 --> 11:22.585
'Cause she can't get
anywhere near this.

11:22.587 --> 11:26.005
Which is why she'll never know
about me doing this.

11:26.007 --> 11:29.258
Or anyone else in the family.

11:32.879 --> 11:35.231
I always liked Danny.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.549
Even during the darkest days
of my marriage to Erin,

11:37.551 --> 11:39.551
he was always willing
to look at both sides,

11:39.553 --> 11:42.154
unlike some people I could name.

11:43.023 --> 11:44.690
So you'll do it?

11:44.692 --> 11:46.942
On one condition: that I don't
hear one word of advice

11:46.944 --> 11:48.560
from you or Frank,
you got it?

11:48.562 --> 11:50.196
But what if...

11:50.198 --> 11:52.198
Not a word.

11:53.566 --> 11:55.034
Where's Danny?

11:55.036 --> 11:56.085
The 5-4.

11:56.087 --> 11:59.121
Internal Affairs is probably
there already.

11:59.123 --> 12:01.373
Better get a move on.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.509
I'll send you my bill.

12:03.511 --> 12:06.578
You can thank me
with a check for the amount.

12:13.086 --> 12:14.270
All right.

12:14.272 --> 12:15.521
Let's go over it again.

12:15.523 --> 12:17.723
We've already been over
it three times already.

12:17.725 --> 12:19.058
I know.

12:19.060 --> 12:20.860
Someone planted
the drugs in your car.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.061
Then some cop pulls me over

12:22.063 --> 12:23.779
and there's a bag
of coke in there!

12:23.781 --> 12:26.198
And between these two events,

12:26.200 --> 12:28.200
the only time you weren't
in your vehicle

12:28.202 --> 12:31.070
is while you were
at the Wojcik Bakery

12:31.072 --> 12:32.705
for five minutes at most.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.740
Yeah, that's right,
five minutes.

12:34.742 --> 12:37.109
How long does it take
for somebody to come by

12:37.111 --> 12:38.494
and stuff some
drugs in my car?

12:38.496 --> 12:39.945
I don't know.

12:39.947 --> 12:41.280
You tell me.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.636
Okay, maybe it was ten minutes.

12:47.638 --> 12:50.956
Detective, you've taken out
$58,000's worth

12:50.958 --> 12:53.175
of pension loans
over the last couple of years.

12:53.177 --> 12:54.226
Is that right?

12:58.298 --> 13:00.733
Being broke...

13:00.735 --> 13:02.268
is not a crime.

13:02.270 --> 13:05.321
No, but it can make
a man desperate.

13:05.323 --> 13:07.306
And I guess that's
why you've also

13:07.308 --> 13:09.191
been pestering
the Paid Details Unit

13:09.193 --> 13:11.143
for extra work recently, right?

13:11.145 --> 13:12.862
It wasn't my stuff.

13:12.864 --> 13:14.330
Somebody put it there.

13:14.332 --> 13:16.715
So you're saying
you have enemies.

13:16.717 --> 13:20.669
You've investigated me before,
Captain.

13:20.671 --> 13:22.004
What do you think?

13:22.006 --> 13:23.822
I think I've seen
good cops go bad

13:23.824 --> 13:25.257
a lot more times than I'd like.

13:25.259 --> 13:26.325
If you're not

13:26.327 --> 13:28.210
gonna do your job,
then act like a real cop

13:28.212 --> 13:30.513
and find out
who's setting me up.

13:30.515 --> 13:32.348
Maybe you can cut me loose

13:32.350 --> 13:35.834
so I can do my job
and find out for myself.

13:35.836 --> 13:39.772
Danny, I'd like to help you.

13:39.774 --> 13:42.174
But you know this is not
how it works.

13:42.176 --> 13:43.976
Course not.

13:46.363 --> 13:48.113
Danny, don't say another word.

13:48.115 --> 13:50.199
Jack Boyle.
Boyle, Baxter & Russell.

13:50.201 --> 13:52.401
I'd like to speak to my client.

13:56.522 --> 13:58.541
See you at arraignment,
Detective.

14:03.496 --> 14:05.414
Wow.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.532
How you doing, Danny?

14:07.534 --> 14:08.518
Not too good,

14:08.519 --> 14:10.636
if I need a heavy hitter
like you

14:10.638 --> 14:12.571
to come down here
and represent me.

14:12.573 --> 14:15.774
So let's get to work.

14:22.415 --> 14:23.616
I'm meeting with your union rep

14:23.618 --> 14:25.401
in an hour
to discuss our options,

14:25.403 --> 14:27.136
then I'll be filing a motion
to suppress evidence,

14:27.138 --> 14:29.371
given the unwarranted
search and seizure.

14:29.373 --> 14:32.824
Jack, I gave the guy consent
to search my vehicle.

14:32.826 --> 14:33.992
You sure?

14:33.994 --> 14:36.178
Maybe that road was too
noisy for him to hear.

14:36.180 --> 14:38.464
I must be going crazy
because, if I didn't know

14:38.466 --> 14:40.933
any better,
I'd say that my ex was acting

14:40.935 --> 14:42.768
as my brother's
defense attorney.

14:42.770 --> 14:44.169
As if you didn't know.

14:44.171 --> 14:46.388
Erin didn't hire me.

14:46.390 --> 14:48.274
Yeah, he's not lying for once.

14:48.276 --> 14:49.775
Well, then, who did?

14:49.777 --> 14:50.693
Let's just say

14:50.695 --> 14:52.194
my Reagan radar
went off,

14:52.196 --> 14:54.012
and I knew you
needed help.

14:54.847 --> 14:56.315
Like I need
to get going.

14:56.317 --> 14:57.867
I'll give you a call, Danny.
All right.

14:57.869 --> 15:00.119
Seriously, who hired...?

15:00.121 --> 15:02.121
I got to get to work.

15:02.906 --> 15:05.407
Okay, yeah, don't mind me,
anyone,

15:05.409 --> 15:08.527
I'll just walk all the way back
to Staten Island.

15:08.529 --> 15:10.546
Taxi!

15:15.835 --> 15:17.920
Longest night
of my life.

15:17.922 --> 15:19.522
It's gonna be okay.

15:19.524 --> 15:22.207
I'm not so sure
about that.

15:22.209 --> 15:24.209
Detective Reagan.

15:24.211 --> 15:26.145
I turned in my gun and shield
last night.

15:26.147 --> 15:27.563
That's not what I'm here for.

15:27.565 --> 15:29.982
Uh, you want
my off-duty weapon, too?

15:29.984 --> 15:32.685
File says you own
a snub-nosed .38?

15:32.687 --> 15:33.736
That's right.

15:33.738 --> 15:36.322
I keep it in a lockbox
over there. Do you mind?

15:41.828 --> 15:42.995
What is going on?

15:42.997 --> 15:44.413
First your family
goes AWOL, and now

15:44.415 --> 15:46.782
the department is treating
you like some criminal.

15:46.784 --> 15:48.834
Captain Elwood's just doing
what he's supposed to do.

15:48.836 --> 15:50.252
Everybody is.

15:50.254 --> 15:51.903
Just try to stay calm,
all right?

15:51.905 --> 15:53.872
Okay.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.584
Did you move my lockbox?

16:05.586 --> 16:07.269
No.

16:07.271 --> 16:08.971
Did you tell the boys
where it was?

16:08.973 --> 16:11.757
Of course not.

16:14.362 --> 16:15.527
My gun's gone.

16:15.529 --> 16:17.146
Maybe you forgot
where you put it, Detective.

16:17.148 --> 16:18.864
It's an honest mistake.

16:18.866 --> 16:20.265
I did not misplace
my gun, okay?

16:20.267 --> 16:22.201
Somebody must have
taken it, w...

16:23.937 --> 16:25.204
...which means
whoever's setting me up

16:25.206 --> 16:26.372
was in this house.

16:48.652 --> 16:50.787
Thanks, guys.

16:50.789 --> 16:52.906
That was fun.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.390
I haven't worked a
burglary in years.

16:54.392 --> 16:55.658
I bet.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.710
Uh, look, let me know what
the lab comes back with, okay?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.445
Prints, fibers,
anything could tell me

16:59.447 --> 17:00.497
who was in this house.

17:00.499 --> 17:02.048
Will do.
Thanks.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.169
Hi.
Hey.

17:06.171 --> 17:07.921
Hey.

17:07.923 --> 17:10.122
What's going on?

17:10.124 --> 17:11.290
Why are all these people here?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.458
You know,
they're just here

17:12.460 --> 17:14.227
to make sure the house
is safe and secure,

17:14.229 --> 17:15.929
which it is,
so no excuses

17:15.931 --> 17:17.347
for you guys to not get upstairs

17:17.348 --> 17:19.098
and get started
on your homework, okay?

17:20.068 --> 17:22.435
Go on, both of you.

17:24.855 --> 17:26.606
You sure we're safe here?

17:27.942 --> 17:29.859
What if whoever it was
comes back?

17:29.861 --> 17:32.695
Look, whoever it is
that's setting me up

17:32.697 --> 17:35.081
is not going to want
to risk the exposure.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.583
Well, you have any
idea who that is?

17:36.585 --> 17:38.751
No, and you shouldn't
worry yourself about it.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.119
Danny,

17:40.121 --> 17:42.956
you know, maybe your family has
to take a hands-off approach

17:42.958 --> 17:45.041
about this, but I don't.

17:45.043 --> 17:46.626
So, what, this has got
to be someone

17:46.628 --> 17:48.127
that you busted, right,
somebody that's trying

17:48.129 --> 17:49.796
to get back at you?
I don't know.

17:49.798 --> 17:51.931
Get back at...
I said I don't know!

18:11.202 --> 18:13.803
Do we have a new news cycle yet?

18:13.805 --> 18:17.407
Yes. Danny's jam
is now on page two.

18:17.409 --> 18:18.741
That's progress.

18:18.743 --> 18:21.411
Until another shoe drops,
then it's back to page one.

18:21.413 --> 18:23.246
Unless it's the proof
he's innocent,

18:23.248 --> 18:24.797
in which case
it'll be back there

18:24.799 --> 18:26.966
with the Poconos
real estate ads.

18:26.968 --> 18:30.086
Welcome to my world.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.141
And what did we have
to say today?

18:35.143 --> 18:36.476
"The commissioner

18:36.478 --> 18:38.428
"looks forward to reading
the Internal Affairs report

18:38.430 --> 18:40.763
"after its thorough
and impartial investigation

18:40.765 --> 18:43.650
of Detective Reagan."

18:43.652 --> 18:46.486
Zero calories, same great taste.

18:46.488 --> 18:47.987
On the unofficial
side of things,

18:47.989 --> 18:51.107
I did some digging into
IAB's case against Danny.

18:51.109 --> 18:52.158
Why are you telling me this?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.326
Because you
want to know.

18:53.328 --> 18:54.444
Doesn't mean I should.

18:54.446 --> 18:55.662
There are some
inconsistencies...

18:55.664 --> 18:57.447
Stop.

19:02.920 --> 19:07.540
Once in a while, like today...

19:07.542 --> 19:10.460
I wish I could work it
like the other side does.

19:10.462 --> 19:12.629
Like the other side does?

19:14.431 --> 19:17.583
Like some gangster--
Freddie the Machete or whoever.

19:17.585 --> 19:20.136
His son gets framed...

19:20.138 --> 19:23.306
he has a whole orbit he can tap

19:23.308 --> 19:26.059
and take things
back into his own hands.

19:26.061 --> 19:28.227
You have an entire army.

19:29.481 --> 19:33.066
And I can't use a single one
of them to help my boy.

19:36.036 --> 19:38.237
I got into a jam a while back.

19:39.373 --> 19:41.457
And suddenly I got out of it.

19:45.713 --> 19:47.797
And I never knew who to thank.

19:47.799 --> 19:51.417
Sometimes that's the way
it has to be.

20:01.562 --> 20:02.979
No, no phone orders.

20:02.981 --> 20:04.764
Come in, please.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

20:04.766 --> 20:06.432
Hey, Mr. Wojcik.

20:06.434 --> 20:08.467
Jamie Reagan.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.687
Long time.
Yeah, how you been?

20:10.689 --> 20:11.654
Good. Busy.

20:11.656 --> 20:12.939
Uh, what can
I get for you?

20:12.941 --> 20:15.258
I'm sure you heard
about last Tuesday.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.526
I was just wondering

20:16.528 --> 20:19.245
if you saw
anyone suspicious outside

20:19.247 --> 20:20.813
before or after Danny was here?

20:20.815 --> 20:22.665
Who?

20:22.667 --> 20:24.450
My brother Danny-- he was here.

20:24.452 --> 20:26.285
No, no, I have not seen Danny

20:26.287 --> 20:28.204
in many years.

20:28.206 --> 20:30.322
What do you mean?
He was here last Tuesday night.

20:30.324 --> 20:32.375
But he wasn't, like I told
the other policemen--

20:32.377 --> 20:33.793
same question.

20:33.795 --> 20:35.428
Maybe you got it mixed up.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.213
No.
He came in

20:37.215 --> 20:39.265
after closing, he ordered
a chocolate cheesecake

20:39.267 --> 20:40.650
and some <i>paczkis.</i>
I know my orders.

20:40.652 --> 20:42.518
No mix-up.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.270
Listen, Jamie,
this is truth.

20:44.272 --> 20:46.105
I run family business.

20:46.107 --> 20:48.174
Right now,
very, very busy.

20:48.176 --> 20:50.977
<i>Potrzebuji</i>
<i>pomocy tutaj!</i>

20:53.513 --> 20:54.847
Mr., Mr. Wojcik.

20:55.783 --> 20:56.683
Mr. Wojcik, hey.

20:57.451 --> 20:59.351
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:00.988 --> 21:03.122
Someone get to you?

21:03.124 --> 21:05.658
Someone threaten you to make
you change your story?

21:05.660 --> 21:09.078
Because my brother was here
and you served him.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.214
What, are you
calling me a liar?

21:11.915 --> 21:13.383
Are you calling
me a liar?!

21:13.385 --> 21:16.202
No one calls me a
liar in my store!

21:16.204 --> 21:18.137
Just listen to me.
It's my store; you get out!

21:18.139 --> 21:19.505
Get out!

21:20.257 --> 21:21.641
Go, Jamie!

21:21.643 --> 21:23.843
Okay.

21:27.231 --> 21:29.982
Okay, so that's a wash.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.768
How about Bobby Stevens?

21:31.770 --> 21:34.520
I think I put him away
for manslaughter in '99.

21:34.522 --> 21:36.522
Yep, Bobby Stevens.

21:36.524 --> 21:39.942
Went to Dannemora in '99,
released in 2010.

21:39.944 --> 21:41.778
Okay, could be a winner, then.

21:41.780 --> 21:43.830
Then went to Sing Sing in 2011

21:43.832 --> 21:45.665
for vehicular homicide.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.916
Fantastic.

21:46.918 --> 21:48.418
Let's try Jose Garcia.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.569
I collared him in '08;
I think he tried

21:50.571 --> 21:52.789
to rip my head off
in the interrogation room.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.925
Garcia is also a no-go.

21:55.927 --> 21:58.044
Died at Fishkill back in March.

21:59.046 --> 22:01.247
Hang on, Kate.

22:05.652 --> 22:07.887
I got to call you back, Kate.

22:07.889 --> 22:09.472
Danny, is everything all right?

22:09.474 --> 22:11.641
I don't know.

22:30.244 --> 22:31.994
What the hell are you doing?!

22:33.131 --> 22:34.780
Danny!

22:34.782 --> 22:36.115
It's just me, Burt.

22:36.117 --> 22:38.784
Burt, what the hell
are you doing?

22:38.786 --> 22:42.004
Nothing. I mean, I was
just out walking Stella,

22:42.006 --> 22:44.390
and I saw just one light
on in your house...

22:44.392 --> 22:46.309
So you just started
snooping around.

22:46.311 --> 22:48.460
I-I didn't know
what was going on.

22:48.462 --> 22:50.462
It's just, uh...

22:50.464 --> 22:52.231
It's just what, Burt?

22:52.233 --> 22:56.135
I was watching the news
the other night...

22:56.137 --> 22:59.188
and this report comes on
about you.

22:59.190 --> 23:01.741
You can't believe everything
you hear, Burt.

23:01.743 --> 23:04.660
It's just a misunderstanding
is all.

23:04.662 --> 23:07.530
Sorry about the snooping.
Really.

23:07.532 --> 23:09.832
It's okay. Just go ahead
and walk your dog, okay?

23:09.834 --> 23:12.034
Come on, Stella,
let's get out of here.

23:13.871 --> 23:15.154
Burt, hold on.

23:15.156 --> 23:16.506
You walk your dog

23:16.508 --> 23:18.374
couple times a day, right?

23:18.376 --> 23:19.658
Four or five.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.127
Four or five.

23:21.129 --> 23:23.296
How about Tuesday
afternoon, evening--

23:23.298 --> 23:26.999
when you walked her, did you,
uh, see a car parked out here?

23:27.001 --> 23:28.467
Just yours.

23:28.469 --> 23:29.685
What? That car?

23:30.503 --> 23:32.104
No.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.473
The sedan you drive sometimes.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.360
Lights on the back deck.

23:37.362 --> 23:39.562
The unmarked police car?

23:39.564 --> 23:41.147
Right.

23:43.016 --> 23:46.018
That wasn't me.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.154
Son of a bitch.

23:48.156 --> 23:50.656
I'm telling you,
whoever it is is on the job.

23:50.658 --> 23:52.858
There's an unmarked car
in front of my house

23:52.860 --> 23:54.360
the day my gun goes missing.

23:54.362 --> 23:56.128
This guy knows
my every next move.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.246
Who else could it be?

23:57.248 --> 23:59.365
Well, it wasn't the
guy who pulled you over.

23:59.367 --> 24:01.417
Officer Ritter I checked.
He's clean as a whistle.

24:01.419 --> 24:04.503
Okay, well, if it's not him,
it's another cop.

24:05.956 --> 24:08.024
How well do you know
your partner?

24:08.026 --> 24:09.375
Kate? I don't know.

24:09.377 --> 24:11.928
I worked with her a few months.
She's all right. Why?

24:11.930 --> 24:15.781
You ever considered she was
a field associate from IAB,

24:15.783 --> 24:19.185
sent to the 5-4 to be
their eyes and ears?

24:19.187 --> 24:21.404
Come on, Jack.

24:21.406 --> 24:22.672
Look,

24:22.674 --> 24:23.990
I'm paranoid enough as it is.

24:23.992 --> 24:25.575
You want me
to start running around

24:25.577 --> 24:26.892
thinking my partner's involved
in this?

24:26.894 --> 24:29.612
Everything's on the table,
Danny.

24:32.950 --> 24:35.234
We're home.

24:37.204 --> 24:38.237
Hi, Uncle Jack.

24:38.239 --> 24:40.239
Guys.

24:41.508 --> 24:42.592
Whoa.

24:42.594 --> 24:44.410
How's the other guy look, Jack?

24:44.412 --> 24:45.911
Your eye, kiddo.

24:45.913 --> 24:47.179
I just ran into a locker.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.015
Coach looked at it.
He said it's fine.

24:49.017 --> 24:51.217
He's a klutz.
No, no.

24:51.219 --> 24:54.053
I got a black eye playing hockey
when I was his age, too.

24:54.055 --> 24:54.921
You did?

24:54.923 --> 24:56.889
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.

24:56.891 --> 24:58.107
And then he went around school

24:58.109 --> 25:00.092
and had all the girls kiss him
till it felt better.

25:00.094 --> 25:01.260
Ew!

25:01.262 --> 25:03.229
"Ew" is
right. Come on.

25:03.231 --> 25:05.031
Let's go get your gear off.

25:08.201 --> 25:11.454
No offense, but I'm gonna take
a closer look at your partner.

25:11.456 --> 25:13.289
All right.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.458
Thanks, Jack.

25:15.460 --> 25:16.659
Hang in there.

25:16.661 --> 25:17.994
All right.

25:37.575 --> 25:39.648
Hi, Dad.

25:39.650 --> 25:41.400
You're up early.

25:41.402 --> 25:45.020
Yeah. Is the, uh,
coffee still hot?

25:45.022 --> 25:47.556
You didn't come here for coffee.

25:47.558 --> 25:50.793
I guess I didn't.

25:54.581 --> 25:57.950
I heard that Linda got in
everyone's face the other night.

25:57.952 --> 26:01.720
Yeah. And everybody
understood completely.

26:01.722 --> 26:03.389
Right.

26:03.391 --> 26:05.224
But I wanted to tell you myself

26:05.226 --> 26:09.294
that, uh, I know you all are
doing the right thing.

26:09.296 --> 26:11.964
You can't get involved.
It's...

26:13.800 --> 26:16.185
...the line we walk.

26:19.906 --> 26:22.641
I appreciate you saying that.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.647
Internal Affairs
treating you okay?

26:28.649 --> 26:32.535
You know,
as well as can be expected.

26:32.537 --> 26:34.587
They got to do what they do.

26:34.589 --> 26:37.673
But, Dad, it's...
it's not IAB

26:37.675 --> 26:41.260
that's keeping me up at night.

26:41.262 --> 26:43.762
It's how good the guy
that's framing me is.

26:43.764 --> 26:45.297
Don't go down that road.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.850
You're an innocent man.

26:47.852 --> 26:49.835
I know.

26:49.837 --> 26:52.771
But if I was in IAB's shoes,

26:52.773 --> 26:55.224
I'd like me for this, too, Dad.

27:01.281 --> 27:02.815
Jack, it's Danny.

27:02.817 --> 27:04.516
I'm following up
on your suspicion about Kate.

27:04.518 --> 27:05.701
I'll let you know what happens.

27:21.501 --> 27:24.753
♪

27:37.268 --> 27:39.018
Good luck.

27:45.391 --> 27:46.609
Hey.

27:49.696 --> 27:52.998
Danny, you're not supposed
to be anywhere near here.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.733
I know.

27:54.735 --> 27:56.919
Might see something
I'm not supposed to, huh?

27:56.921 --> 27:58.003
Excuse me?

27:58.005 --> 27:59.237
Well...

27:59.239 --> 28:01.239
I saw you talking
to Elwood back there.

28:01.241 --> 28:03.842
He came up to the squad
to interview me about you.

28:03.844 --> 28:05.511
Is that right?
And I gave him

28:05.513 --> 28:08.013
a glowing review; I told him
it had to be a setup.

28:08.015 --> 28:10.015
Is that what you guys
were smiling about,

28:10.017 --> 28:11.416
getting all chummy about?

28:15.972 --> 28:17.923
Hop in, Kate.

28:26.232 --> 28:29.535
Look, Danny,
Derek and I are friends.

28:29.537 --> 28:32.321
Last summer
when I worked at IAB,

28:32.323 --> 28:35.457
he opened up to me about some
marital problems he was having.

28:35.459 --> 28:37.609
He asked for my perspective.

28:37.611 --> 28:39.128
I think he's a good guy.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.946
I think he's a rat.

28:40.948 --> 28:45.117
Look, Danny,
I know it is rough

28:45.119 --> 28:47.419
riding this out
on the sidelines,

28:47.421 --> 28:51.390
and if it were happening to me,
I'd probably be paranoid, too,

28:51.392 --> 28:53.592
but I am not your enemy.

28:53.594 --> 28:55.477
You sure about that, Kate?

28:55.479 --> 28:58.013
I'm 100% sure.

28:58.015 --> 29:00.149
I believe you, Danny.

29:04.971 --> 29:06.739
Okay.

29:08.491 --> 29:10.859
I think we've been
going about this the wrong way.

29:10.861 --> 29:12.611
I don't think

29:12.613 --> 29:14.813
it's a cop
who I pissed off before.

29:14.815 --> 29:16.999
Who? Someone you're
going after now?

29:17.001 --> 29:18.417
But which case?

29:18.419 --> 29:20.152
The bodega shooting is cold.

29:20.154 --> 29:21.486
The hit-and-run
is even colder.

29:21.488 --> 29:23.706
I think it's got something to do
with the black book.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.991
We need to pay that bookie,
Alan Greer, a visit.

29:25.993 --> 29:28.293
I mean, think about it.
I try for the warrant,

29:28.295 --> 29:31.714
a couple hours later, I get
arrested, my gun goes missing.

29:31.716 --> 29:34.049
And all hell breaks loose.
Anybody could have heard me

29:34.051 --> 29:36.935
talking about it in the squad,
at the D.A.'s office.

29:36.937 --> 29:39.504
Somebody tips
this guy off, and...

29:39.506 --> 29:41.807
Look, the
bottom line is,

29:41.809 --> 29:44.059
we got to find someone else
who we can trust

29:44.061 --> 29:46.195
to get us another warrant
for that black book.

29:46.197 --> 29:48.113
It can't my sister.
I can trust her,

29:48.115 --> 29:49.848
but she can't help me
on this one.

29:49.850 --> 29:52.117
You think
I don't know an A.D.A. or two?

30:01.611 --> 30:04.463
Alan Greer,
we have a search warrant!

30:04.465 --> 30:06.398
Danny, we're in.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.966
Okay. Is the bookie there?

30:07.968 --> 30:10.385
Alan Greer, show yourself!

30:10.387 --> 30:12.054
I'm not seeing him.

30:12.056 --> 30:14.089
Well, what are you seeing, Kate?
Talk to me.

30:15.391 --> 30:16.592
We got a body.

30:16.594 --> 30:20.596
Kate? Kate, what's going on?

30:26.385 --> 30:28.487
Whoever's doing this
beat us here.

30:28.489 --> 30:29.738
Well, did they get the book?

30:30.657 --> 30:32.241
No, I don't think so.

30:32.243 --> 30:33.575
The safe is still shut.

30:33.577 --> 30:35.077
Okay. What about Greer?

30:35.079 --> 30:38.280
He's dead. Single shot
to the back of the head.

30:38.282 --> 30:39.231
What?!

30:41.368 --> 30:45.120
Danny, where did you go
after we talked earlier?

30:45.122 --> 30:46.571
Are you kidding me, Kate?

30:46.573 --> 30:47.739
Answer the question.

30:47.741 --> 30:48.924
I drove home.

30:48.926 --> 30:50.509
I drove straight home.

30:50.511 --> 30:52.845
And I spoke to my wife
the entire time

30:52.847 --> 30:54.713
until I pulled up
into my driveway.

30:54.715 --> 30:57.415
You don't believe me? Dump
my phone and check the tolls.

30:57.417 --> 30:58.967
I had to ask.

30:58.969 --> 31:00.686
No, I don't know
you had to ask, Kate.

31:00.688 --> 31:02.020
Now, have ESU cut
that safe open

31:02.022 --> 31:03.222
and see if the book's inside.

31:03.224 --> 31:05.423
Okay.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.082
We're opening
the safe now, Reagan.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.074
The book's not in the safe,
Danny.

31:34.076 --> 31:36.927
No. Kate, we were told
that the book is in the safe.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.912
Maybe he had it out
when they came for him.

31:38.914 --> 31:40.914
Tear this place apart.
Right. You heard her.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.516
No. No, no, no, no!

31:42.518 --> 31:43.884
The warrant says

31:43.886 --> 31:46.020
that we can only check the safe,
that's it.

31:46.022 --> 31:47.938
I-I'm sorry, Danny. I-I can't
hear you. You're breaking up.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.089
Kate!

31:49.091 --> 31:50.608
I'll let you know
when I know anything.

31:50.610 --> 31:51.776
Kate?

31:51.778 --> 31:53.644
Don't do that, Kate. Kate!

31:53.646 --> 31:56.480
Come on, boys.
Let's do this.

32:05.207 --> 32:07.708
No, they didn't find the book,
but what they did find:

32:07.710 --> 32:09.660
the ballistics on the
gun that killed Greer

32:09.662 --> 32:12.046
matches Danny's
off-duty piece.

32:12.048 --> 32:14.999
Where's the light at
the end of this tunnel?

32:15.001 --> 32:18.302
Seems like it's the train
coming right at him.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.087
Yeah, well, now there's murder
attached to this.

32:20.089 --> 32:21.305
That's not on Danny.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.007
Try telling him that.

32:24.910 --> 32:27.478
Look, I know you think it's time

32:27.480 --> 32:30.297
we kicked down the door
and got our hands on this.

32:30.299 --> 32:31.965
I didn't say that.

32:31.967 --> 32:34.268
Well, you didn't have to.
I feel the same way.

32:34.270 --> 32:35.653
But we can't?

32:35.655 --> 32:38.205
No. We can't.

32:38.207 --> 32:39.857
I just can't stop thinking
that if Saul

32:39.859 --> 32:41.492
had gotten him that
warrant last week,

32:41.494 --> 32:43.777
that maybe this wouldn't
have gone this far.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.283
Danny went to Saul Ward on this?

32:49.285 --> 32:51.418
Yeah, he went to Saul,
because he doesn't want

32:51.420 --> 32:52.819
everyone to think
he's always running

32:52.821 --> 32:55.089
to his sister
for help.

32:55.091 --> 32:57.658
Well, that's the second time
his name's come up today.

32:57.660 --> 32:59.426
When was the first?

32:59.428 --> 33:02.346
I accidentally was looking

33:02.348 --> 33:04.265
at Derek Elwood's file.

33:04.267 --> 33:05.832
He investigated

33:05.834 --> 33:07.351
another shooting
of Danny's last year.

33:07.353 --> 33:11.272
And Saul, in his cop days,
was his partner.

33:11.274 --> 33:13.307
I knew he was a cop, but...

33:13.309 --> 33:15.976
It's probably
just a coincidence.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.064
In a case based on
nothing but coincidence.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.482
What are you thinking?

33:23.519 --> 33:24.869
Can you keep a secret?

33:24.871 --> 33:26.687
Yeah.

33:26.689 --> 33:29.623
Good. So can I.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.589
Ah, zombie dogs.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.391
The breakfast of champions.

33:50.211 --> 33:51.979
Deputy Commissioner Moore?

33:51.981 --> 33:53.514
But right now,

33:53.516 --> 33:56.717
just a private citizen
out taking a walk.

33:56.719 --> 33:58.402
Okay.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.071
And thinking about the jam
our mutual acquaintance is in.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.890
Uh-huh.

34:03.892 --> 34:05.576
I'm guessing you are, too?

34:05.578 --> 34:07.394
And what I'm thinking--

34:07.396 --> 34:10.563
not that you asked--

34:10.565 --> 34:14.618
oftentimes,
the bluebird of happiness

34:14.620 --> 34:16.120
is in our own backyard.

34:17.371 --> 34:20.373
In this case,
that being the thing

34:20.376 --> 34:23.677
which could connect the dots
for our mutual acquaintance.

34:25.429 --> 34:26.597
Really?

34:26.599 --> 34:28.748
Maybe.

34:33.888 --> 34:37.257
And if I find something,
should I bring it to you?

34:39.978 --> 34:41.895
Sorry. Stupid question.

34:41.897 --> 34:45.199
You have a productive day.

34:56.077 --> 34:57.494
Kate?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.112
Got your call. What's up?

34:59.114 --> 35:00.965
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

35:00.967 --> 35:02.132
You know what, Derek?

35:02.134 --> 35:04.134
Uh, I think we should talk
somewhere privately.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.886
Sure.

35:05.888 --> 35:07.388
Sarge.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.456
Hey.

35:11.125 --> 35:12.893
Thank you.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.516
Reagan.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.934
Captain.

35:22.070 --> 35:24.405
Detective Reagan's gonna sit in,
if that's okay.

35:24.407 --> 35:25.823
Sure.
Anyone else

35:25.825 --> 35:26.774
want coffee?

35:26.776 --> 35:28.475
I'm good.
Me, too.

35:28.477 --> 35:29.827
Be right back.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.746
What's this about?

35:32.748 --> 35:34.281
Oh, you don't know?
No, I don't know.

35:34.283 --> 35:36.000
What-what's going on?

35:37.118 --> 35:38.652
Oh, you're good.

35:38.654 --> 35:41.088
I mean, you're really good.

35:41.090 --> 35:44.091
In fact, I spent this whole week
not sleeping a wink,

35:44.093 --> 35:46.710
thinking about
just how good you are.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.828
Good about what?

35:47.830 --> 35:49.296
I mean, wh-what the hell
are you talking about,

35:49.298 --> 35:50.714
Reagan?
You set me up.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.849
What?

35:51.851 --> 35:53.350
It makes sense, doesn't it?

35:53.352 --> 35:55.269
If you didn't ruin my life,

35:55.271 --> 35:57.104
your whole life was gonna
come tumbling down.

35:57.106 --> 35:58.856
Listen, I understand
you're under

35:58.858 --> 36:00.641
a ton of pressure,
but you know what,

36:00.643 --> 36:02.609
you-you really need
to see somebody, pal.

36:02.611 --> 36:03.894
You broke into my home!

36:03.896 --> 36:05.562
My house!

36:05.564 --> 36:09.015
Where my wife and my kids sleep!

36:09.868 --> 36:11.351
All right, you know what?

36:11.353 --> 36:12.403
Where you going?

36:13.872 --> 36:15.489
Open this door!
Where the hell you going?

36:15.491 --> 36:16.857
Is there a problem?

36:16.859 --> 36:17.825
Yeah, there's a problem!

36:17.827 --> 36:19.126
Your partner's lost his mind!

36:20.745 --> 36:23.714
We found what you were
looking for, Captain.

36:23.716 --> 36:25.466
I don't know what that is.

36:25.468 --> 36:26.884
Sure you do.
No.

36:26.886 --> 36:28.469
Well, it's Greer's black book.

36:28.471 --> 36:31.004
I mean, you killed him
trying to find it.

36:31.873 --> 36:33.590
Hmm?

36:33.592 --> 36:34.558
But don't feel bad,

36:34.560 --> 36:36.877
we thought it was
in the safe, too.

36:36.879 --> 36:38.562
It kind of was.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.931
Safe had a false bottom.

36:40.933 --> 36:41.982
Really well done.

36:41.984 --> 36:43.100
Everybody missed it,

36:43.102 --> 36:44.818
until I went
to the manufacturer's Web site

36:44.820 --> 36:45.986
and I looked at the model.

36:45.988 --> 36:47.688
What does all this
have to do with me?

36:47.690 --> 36:49.556
Greer, the bookie,
kept a log

36:49.558 --> 36:52.693
of every bet you ever made,
every dime you ever sunk

36:52.695 --> 36:54.611
into gambling,
and let me tell you,

36:54.613 --> 36:57.197
there are a lot of dimes
in there, Captain.

36:57.199 --> 36:59.283
Which caused you
your financial problems,

36:59.285 --> 37:01.585
which led to your
marital problems,

37:01.587 --> 37:02.836
and then when you realized

37:02.838 --> 37:05.172
he was about to blow
the whole thing open,

37:05.174 --> 37:07.291
caused your
Danny Reagan problem.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.461
Yeah.

37:10.463 --> 37:12.262
You still got
that problem, Captain.

37:12.264 --> 37:15.215
All right, you guys
have both lost your mind.

37:15.217 --> 37:16.249
Is that right?

37:16.251 --> 37:18.018
Yeah.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.306
You want to reach for that gun,
don't you, Captain?

37:23.391 --> 37:24.691
Do it.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.428
Give me an excuse
to rip your head off.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.118
Go to hell.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.236
After you.

37:38.105 --> 37:40.457
I invited a friend
of yours down.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.942
Start you on your journey.

37:41.944 --> 37:44.745
You remember Saul,
your old IAB partner.

37:44.747 --> 37:45.779
And the one you
called to see

37:45.781 --> 37:46.797
if Danny was
getting a warrant

37:46.799 --> 37:48.615
for Alan Greer's book.

37:53.421 --> 37:56.957
When you called, I had no idea
you were gonna do this.

37:56.959 --> 37:58.675
Saul...
No, there's

37:58.677 --> 38:00.310
nothing to say, Elwood.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.795
It's over.

38:01.797 --> 38:03.730
But I...

38:06.568 --> 38:08.652
I want to see my attorney.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.571
That's the first

38:10.573 --> 38:12.406
smart move you've made
in a week.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.609
Sarge.

38:15.611 --> 38:17.110
My pleasure.

38:17.112 --> 38:18.662
Gun.

38:19.664 --> 38:20.664
Shield.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.337
Derek Elwood,

38:27.339 --> 38:28.755
you're under arrest.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.342
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.994
Anything you say or do

38:33.996 --> 38:36.930
may be used against you
in a court of law.

38:37.665 --> 38:39.132
Thank you.

38:47.609 --> 38:49.193
Smile, Reagan.

38:51.312 --> 38:54.180
The sun just came out.

38:54.182 --> 38:55.482
And it also

38:55.484 --> 38:57.618
happens to be setting for me.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.186
What are you talking about?

39:00.188 --> 39:02.623
I got word the other day
from Internal Affairs

39:02.625 --> 39:05.075
that they're pulling me back in.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.412
Well.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.363
When do you start?

39:10.365 --> 39:12.666
Monday morning.

39:12.668 --> 39:16.053
Well, Kate, I suggest you

39:16.055 --> 39:19.223
do some cleaning up
up there in I.A., okay?

39:19.225 --> 39:22.226
Sure there's a lot more snakes
where Elwood came from.

39:22.228 --> 39:25.345
That's the first thing
on my list.

39:25.347 --> 39:27.047
Good.

39:27.049 --> 39:28.899
Nice working with you, kid.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.653
Likewise.

39:36.891 --> 39:38.942
Thank you.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.944
Thank you.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.042
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, Thy gifts,

39:55.044 --> 39:57.461
which we are about to receive
from your bounty,

39:57.463 --> 39:59.096
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

39:59.098 --> 40:00.097
Amen.

40:00.099 --> 40:01.765
Amen.
Amen.

40:01.767 --> 40:02.799
Something smells good,

40:02.801 --> 40:04.551
and it's not
the sugar snap peas.

40:05.553 --> 40:06.687
That's the dessert.

40:06.689 --> 40:08.555
Mr. Wojcik threw in a batch

40:08.557 --> 40:10.107
of <i>kolaches</i> with the cheesecake.

40:10.109 --> 40:11.475
Well...

40:11.477 --> 40:12.859
Well, I don't care
if he threw in a $100 bill.

40:12.861 --> 40:13.861
I'm not eating his stuff.

40:13.862 --> 40:14.978
Come on, kid.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.196
Almost went to prison
over this cheesecake.

40:16.198 --> 40:17.364
You got to eat
some of it.

40:17.366 --> 40:19.433
What do you got
against him?

40:19.435 --> 40:22.319
He lied right to my face
about Danny being there.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.540
Really?

40:28.743 --> 40:29.960
I mean, no.

40:29.962 --> 40:31.945
Not right to my face.

40:31.947 --> 40:34.447
He, um, he lied to somebody.

40:34.449 --> 40:36.717
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

40:36.719 --> 40:38.118
Did you know

40:38.120 --> 40:41.004
I got a bill from
your ex-husband

40:41.006 --> 40:42.422
for legal services rendered?

40:44.125 --> 40:47.427
I don't know anything
about that.

40:48.396 --> 40:50.013
Me, neither.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.481
- Hmm.
- He was supposed

40:51.483 --> 40:52.966
to send that bill to me.

40:52.968 --> 40:55.102
He was, was he?

40:55.104 --> 40:57.354
Yeah, I ran into him
on the street.

40:57.356 --> 40:58.522
What street?

40:58.524 --> 41:01.641
How much is the shyster
gouging me for?

41:02.610 --> 41:03.994
One whole dollar.

41:03.996 --> 41:05.228
Oh.

41:06.313 --> 41:08.031
You know,
now that I think about it,

41:08.033 --> 41:10.817
there are some things
that I haven't been quite able

41:10.819 --> 41:13.653
to figure out about how this
all came together.

41:13.655 --> 41:15.488
Kate's a hell of a cop.

41:15.490 --> 41:17.323
But you never did
explain how she was able

41:17.325 --> 41:19.159
to connect Elwood
to Saul Ward.

41:19.994 --> 41:22.162
Hey, I stayed
a million miles away.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.848
Right.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.168
Garrett'll vouch for that.

41:28.170 --> 41:29.436
I'm sure.

41:29.438 --> 41:30.771
Let me get this straight.

41:30.773 --> 41:32.389
You all said that there was

41:32.391 --> 41:35.058
nothing you could do
to help Danny...

41:36.060 --> 41:38.344
...and nothing was what you did?

41:39.180 --> 41:40.647
Right.

41:40.649 --> 41:42.366
Exactly.

41:43.368 --> 41:44.818
Yeah.

41:44.820 --> 41:46.853
You swear on it?

41:49.891 --> 41:52.909
There will be no swearing
at this table.

41:52.911 --> 41:55.379
Could somebody pass the salt?

41:55.381 --> 41:56.580
Thank you.

41:56.582 --> 41:57.697
You're welcome.
