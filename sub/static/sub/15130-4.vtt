Dexter.

the cutest little serial killer.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.035
No, he's actually

I want to try him out
in the I.C.U.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.938
With a couple
of my patients.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.740
I have one word for you --
infection risk.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.742
I mean low-risk patients
like mrs. Rose.

Not a date.
It's just really bad form

For the chief of surgery
to turn up unaccompanied.

tell you it's not a date?

what is going on with his legs.

performed the operation.

a spinal fracture.

an instrument infusion.

the surgery.

Â¶ even though someday
I knew you'd have to go Â¶

42:01.253 --> 42:09.192
Â¶ it didn't stop me
from letting it show Â¶

42:09.194 --> 42:14.163
Â¶ baby, don't blame me

42:14.165 --> 42:15.698
[ both laugh ]

42:15.700 --> 42:18.735
Oh, my god.
That was so dull.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.905
You did -- you did warn me,
but, I mean...

42:21.907 --> 42:23.773
That joke --
what was that joke?

42:23.775 --> 42:26.142
The proctologist
and the flowers.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.011
Yeah, did it even
have a punch line?

42:28.013 --> 42:30.613
No, that was the problem!
There was no punch lines.

42:30.615 --> 42:31.881
At all.
Nothing.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.150
And why would you stuff
chicken with raisins?

42:34.152 --> 42:35.919
I mean,
who wants to eat that?

42:35.921 --> 42:39.122
Lunatics and idiots.

42:39.124 --> 42:40.924
Hey.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.759
I had a good time
tonight.

42:42.761 --> 42:46.563
Yeah.
So did I.

42:48.265 --> 42:52.335
Â¶ I thought
that I was history Â¶

42:52.337 --> 42:55.572
Joel, just -- just...

42:55.574 --> 42:58.841
Because you know
that I'm not traveling alone.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.843
Message received.

43:00.845 --> 43:02.779
Yeah?

43:02.781 --> 43:03.913
Okay.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.583
Okay.
