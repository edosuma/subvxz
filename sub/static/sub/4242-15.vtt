00:01.483 --> 00:02.700
<i>So here's what
you missed on Glee:</i>

00:02.784 --> 00:04.151
<i>Sue's pregnant,
which is crazy...</i>

00:04.202 --> 00:05.903
I had my eggs frozen
in the late '70s.

00:05.987 --> 00:06.853
<i>...and she won't say
who the father is,</i>

00:06.905 --> 00:08.372
<i>but insists that he's famous.</i>

00:08.456 --> 00:09.957
<i>Rachel and Finn
decided to get married</i>

00:10.024 --> 00:11.542
<i>after Regionals,
where the New Directions</i>

00:11.626 --> 00:13.494
<i>beat Sebastian and the Warblers
and a madrigal group</i>

00:13.545 --> 00:15.329
<i>that just sort of made
everyone uncomfortable.</i>

00:15.380 --> 00:17.081
<i>And Sebastian made up with
Blaine after he realized</i>

00:17.165 --> 00:18.699
<i>life's too short to blind
people with rock salt.</i>

00:18.750 --> 00:20.467
<i>Quinn thought Rachel and Finn
were too young to get married,</i>

00:20.535 --> 00:21.886
<i>and refused to go
to the wedding.</i>

00:21.970 --> 00:23.837
...which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved

00:23.889 --> 00:25.639
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.

00:25.707 --> 00:27.474
<i>...but then changed her mind
and started texting</i>

00:27.542 --> 00:28.392
<i>while she raced
to the courthouse,</i>

00:28.476 --> 00:29.894
<i>and her car got hit by a truck.</i>

00:29.978 --> 00:30.811
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee!</i>

00:34.683 --> 00:36.016
(school bell ringing)

00:36.067 --> 00:37.651
So do you think if Quinn
hadn't gotten into her accident,

00:37.719 --> 00:39.853
we still would've gone
through with the wedding?
Yeah, totally.

00:39.905 --> 00:41.722
Totally. I mean,
I'm kind of glad we're waiting.

00:41.773 --> 00:44.158
Now it doesn't have to be
a Justice of the Peace quickie.

00:44.225 --> 00:45.776
Hey, I was thinking
since Nationals

00:45.860 --> 00:47.695
are in Chicago this year,

00:47.746 --> 00:49.697
we-we should have the wedding
someplace special.

00:49.748 --> 00:52.116
Like-like on the pitcher's mound
of Wrigley Field.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.335
O-Or someplace else.
It's not that, it's Quinn.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.203
I can't stop thinking
about her. She's...

00:56.254 --> 00:58.589
Right behind you.

01:05.129 --> 01:07.298
Hi, Quinn!
We missed you so much.

01:07.382 --> 01:09.466
No, don't.

01:09.551 --> 01:12.186
I could have easily become one
of those creepy memorial pages

01:12.253 --> 01:14.972
in the yearbook, but by
the grace of God, I'm here.

01:16.975 --> 01:18.859
Believe it or not...

01:18.926 --> 01:20.477
this is the happiest
day of my life.

01:22.030 --> 01:24.031
Come on, Artie.
I'll race you to the choir room.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.763
Here's a lesson for
your board, Mr. Shue.

03:19.848 --> 03:22.649
Don't text and drive. Ever.

03:22.717 --> 03:24.318
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

03:24.385 --> 03:25.769
Besides sleeping with Puck.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.855
(quiet laughter)

03:27.906 --> 03:30.107
There's a lot of rumors floating
around, so let's clear the air.

03:30.225 --> 03:32.776
First of all, all my plumbing
still works, which is awesome.

03:32.861 --> 03:35.529
But my spine was severely
compressed in the car accident,

03:35.580 --> 03:38.732
which basically means
I can't move my feet or legs.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.066
But the good thing is that

03:40.118 --> 03:41.902
I'm starting to regain feeling,

03:41.953 --> 03:45.539
so with a lot of physical
therapy, and your prayers,

03:45.590 --> 03:47.257
I stand a good chance
for a full recovery.

03:47.342 --> 03:49.176
So no tears.

03:49.243 --> 03:51.745
That means you, Tina.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.764
Oh, and I apologize
for the number.

03:53.848 --> 03:56.183
My dance moves aren't
as smooth as Artie's yet.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.935
With practice,
they will be.

04:01.589 --> 04:05.592
I promise that by the time
we go to Nationals,

04:05.643 --> 04:07.694
I'll be out of this chair,

04:07.762 --> 04:09.747
and dancing on that stage.

04:09.814 --> 04:10.697
All right.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.784

04:24.329 --> 04:26.079
I'm sorry, I...

04:26.131 --> 04:28.832
I don't think I understand
what you just told me.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.235
I said, I'm making
swim coach Roz Washington

04:31.302 --> 04:33.453
co-coach of the Cheerios!

04:33.505 --> 04:36.640
How can you do this to me?

04:36.724 --> 04:38.275
ROZ:
I think I can answer
that question.

04:38.343 --> 04:41.478
This Saturday the Cheerios!
had Regionals tournament.

04:41.563 --> 04:44.348
You were 15 minutes late.
That's unacceptable.

04:44.432 --> 04:46.016
I had a doctor's appointment.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.018
Oh... I know.
The doctor had to shine

04:48.102 --> 04:51.688
a flashlight in your va-jay-jay
to get all the bats to fly out.

04:51.773 --> 04:53.941
I understand that keeping
bats out of your womb

04:53.992 --> 04:57.110
is an important part of having a
baby when you're older than God.

04:57.162 --> 05:01.281
But it is no way to win
a national championship.
Sue...

05:01.332 --> 05:03.801
The lovely and talented
bronze medalist

05:03.868 --> 05:05.586
Roz Washington has a point.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.672
We need the money
and sponsorships that only

05:08.756 --> 05:10.457
a national championship
can bring to the school,

05:10.508 --> 05:13.794
and your condition is
compromising your work.

05:13.845 --> 05:15.262
It's settled.
My word is law.

05:15.329 --> 05:17.681
This will not stand!

05:17.765 --> 05:18.882
Oh, it's gonna stand.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.333
And you know what else
is gonna stand?

05:20.385 --> 05:23.554
Your fully-grown, adult baby

05:23.638 --> 05:26.523
when he pops out of your birth
canal, before he hurries off

05:26.608 --> 05:29.109
to the high-powered law firm
where he has just made partner.

05:29.176 --> 05:32.362
So take your Centrum Silver,
and your old ass,

05:32.447 --> 05:35.315
and find a new dream.

05:42.857 --> 05:45.692
What if I can guarantee you
a national championship?

05:45.743 --> 05:47.127
And how will you do that?

05:47.194 --> 05:49.246
The Glee Club.
If they win at Nationals,

05:49.330 --> 05:51.882
the school wins
a $10,000 cash prize.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.001
I get you that money,

05:54.052 --> 05:57.671
I get to run the cheerleading
program alone!

05:57.722 --> 06:00.173
(whistle blows)
Five, six, seven, eight!

06:00.225 --> 06:01.091
♪

06:07.348 --> 06:09.600
Stop! Please, stop!

06:09.684 --> 06:12.052
This is an embarrassment.

06:12.103 --> 06:14.171
Hey, Mercedes.
Who you texting?

06:14.239 --> 06:15.689
I'm not texting anyone,

06:15.740 --> 06:18.025
I'm donating to
the Obama campaign...

06:18.076 --> 06:20.110
(screams)
My Droid!

06:20.194 --> 06:22.613
Good news! I booked a tour at
the Railroad Museum on Friday,

06:22.697 --> 06:25.365
which means we're gonna have
an awesome Senior's Ditch Day.

06:25.416 --> 06:26.950
What is she doing here?
Hey, Granny Panties!

06:27.035 --> 06:28.619
I'm taking over Booty Camp1

06:28.703 --> 06:30.236
Why on earth do you
want to run Booty Camp?

06:30.288 --> 06:32.372
Because, as I established, I
want to help you win Nationals.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.708
And I am a champion
who can whip that squad

06:34.759 --> 06:36.126
of pear-shaped teens into shape.

06:36.210 --> 06:38.211
You're out of shape,
you're constantly late,

06:38.263 --> 06:39.630
and when you're not
too busy texting,

06:39.714 --> 06:40.931
you're complaining about

06:41.015 --> 06:42.849
the choreography
you're too lazy to learn.

06:42.917 --> 06:45.602
You're nothing but
a coven of tardy,

06:45.687 --> 06:48.272
narcissistic, bloated
bags of cellulite

06:48.356 --> 06:49.940
who will stab each other
in the back

06:50.024 --> 06:51.525
at the first glimpse of a solo

06:51.592 --> 06:54.811
in a competition hosted by
a late-night horror movie host.

06:54.896 --> 06:56.763
Well, those days are over.

06:56.814 --> 06:58.065
(school bell ringing)
Sue?

06:58.116 --> 06:59.533
We need to talk about what
happened at Booty Camp.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.435
Oh, you mean my epic smack down
of the glee club over their

07:02.487 --> 07:04.538
complete apathy and
lack of professionalism?

07:04.605 --> 07:06.540
According to the kids,
you were typical abusive

07:06.607 --> 07:08.292
belligerent self,
only more so.

07:08.376 --> 07:10.327
I just got this
e-mail from Kurt.

07:10.411 --> 07:12.412
"Mr. Shue, save us!

07:12.463 --> 07:14.715
Coach Sue is meaner
than Tabatha!"
First of all,

07:14.782 --> 07:17.217
I have absolutely no idea who
Porcelain is referring to.

07:17.284 --> 07:19.219
I'm assuming it's gay and niche.

07:19.286 --> 07:20.804
Secondly, based on
the pathetic display

07:20.888 --> 07:22.622
I just saw?

07:22.674 --> 07:25.559
Your glee club's back-to-back
victories were flukes.

07:25.626 --> 07:26.727
Oh...
Against Vocal Adrenaline?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.679
On the national stage?

07:28.763 --> 07:30.296
You'll be like lambs
to the slaughter.

07:30.348 --> 07:33.183
Why are you resisting
my help, William?

07:33.267 --> 07:35.235
We should try to
inspire and encourage

07:35.302 --> 07:37.303
our kids, Sue,
not humiliate and crush them.

07:37.355 --> 07:38.638
I don't get it.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.691
You were acting like you
had turned over a new leaf.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.609
William... I'm near the end
of my first trimester.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.278
I'm wildly hormonal, riding out

07:45.330 --> 07:47.480
massive, unpredictable
mood swings.

07:47.532 --> 07:50.000
Stop trying to
understand my actions.

07:50.084 --> 07:52.152
Maybe you should
talk to your doctor

07:52.203 --> 07:54.171
about adjusting your medication?
Oh, I'll ask.

07:54.255 --> 07:56.590
I'm going there this week to
confirm the sex of my daughter.

07:56.657 --> 07:59.626
Mm! Oh, Sue!
That's a mother-to-be

07:59.677 --> 08:01.845
single most important doctor
visit. Who's going with you?

08:01.929 --> 08:03.513
Same person who's going to
help me raise this child,

08:03.598 --> 08:04.998
Barbara Gordon. No one.

08:05.049 --> 08:08.802
We'll...
Sue, you can't go alone.

08:08.853 --> 08:11.004
No, you need a friend there,
for moral support.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.639
I agree.

08:14.475 --> 08:16.643
We'll go with you.

08:18.012 --> 08:18.895
(school bell ringing)

08:18.980 --> 08:20.346
You okay?

08:20.398 --> 08:21.498
You seem a little preoccupied.

08:21.566 --> 08:22.866
Oh, well, my brother's in town.

08:22.950 --> 08:25.018
He's picking me up,
taking me out to lunch.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.519
Blaine, that's exciting!

08:26.571 --> 08:28.789
I finally get to meet this
mysterious brother of yours,

08:28.856 --> 08:30.123
who you refuse to talk about.

08:30.191 --> 08:31.708
I'm dying to know
what he looks like.

08:31.793 --> 08:33.543
Oh, trust me, you...

08:33.628 --> 08:34.910
you already know
what he looks like.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.496
Blainie!

08:36.547 --> 08:37.664
Hey, Coop!
Hey!

08:37.715 --> 08:39.416
Hey.
How are you, bud?

08:39.500 --> 08:40.801
Good. Good to see you, man.

08:40.868 --> 08:41.868
This your,
this your boyfriend, here?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.220
Actually, yes, it is.
Hi.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.338

09:00.554 --> 09:01.988
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but, um,

09:02.056 --> 09:03.490
I just needed to tell you

09:03.557 --> 09:05.909
that I am an enormous
fan of your work.

09:05.993 --> 09:06.993
Thank you.

09:07.061 --> 09:08.829
Will you sign my breast?
My pleasure.

09:09.864 --> 09:11.731
"Keep on dreaming.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.500
"Yours...
Mine.

09:13.567 --> 09:16.402
Cooper Anderson."

09:16.454 --> 09:18.004
You do me a great honor.

09:18.072 --> 09:20.590
And if Alan Menken isn't
personally writing you

09:20.675 --> 09:22.542
a fairy tale musical
at this very moment,

09:22.593 --> 09:25.178
I will hunt him down
and beat him senseless

09:25.246 --> 09:26.463
with a cudgel.
(laughs)

09:26.547 --> 09:31.101
Because you, sir,
are a Disney prince.

09:31.185 --> 09:33.019
Wow.

09:33.087 --> 09:36.356
God, it is great to be
back in the Midwest.

09:36.423 --> 09:38.608
My commercial's on hiatus,

09:38.693 --> 09:41.261
so I told my agent I was
headed back to the heartland

09:41.312 --> 09:43.947
to press the flesh,
do some character research.

09:44.031 --> 09:46.566
Next season's commercials have
a lot more intense, gritty

09:46.617 --> 09:48.201
character stuff, so
I really want to explore

09:48.269 --> 09:50.070
my salt-of-the-earth roots.

09:50.121 --> 09:51.938
Blaine, your brother's
the best-looking man
in North America.

09:51.989 --> 09:53.790
Um, Coop and I are gonna head...
Excuse me.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.876
Gaston, if I could pull you
away from these ladies

09:55.943 --> 09:58.962
for just a moment; I have
something I'd like to ask you.

09:59.046 --> 10:01.581
Yeah. I mean, that's...

10:01.632 --> 10:04.384
that's why I never really
talk about my brother.

10:04.719 --> 10:04.719
+

10:06.753 --> 10:08.421
PUCK:
We all know why we're here.
I've waited five years for this.

10:08.472 --> 10:09.722
I want ideas for
Senior Ditch Day. Go.

10:09.789 --> 10:11.424
Ooh! A Gershwin/Sondheim
scavenger hunt!

10:11.475 --> 10:12.675
That sounds like torture.

10:12.759 --> 10:14.427
We want actual ideas, Kurt.

10:14.478 --> 10:15.895
<i>How about a dance movie
marathon? Footloose...</i>

10:15.962 --> 10:17.763
<i>Footloose 2011.</i>

10:17.814 --> 10:19.398
What about a non-alcoholic
pub crawl?

10:19.466 --> 10:21.400
It's Senior Ditch Day, not
Senior Citizen's Ditch Day.

10:21.468 --> 10:23.853
It's springtime. I would like
to see something give birth.

10:23.937 --> 10:25.538
(giggling)

10:25.606 --> 10:27.857
Quinn, I'm so sorry.

10:27.925 --> 10:30.993
It was my wedding
that you were going to

10:31.078 --> 10:32.995
when you got into
your car crash, and...

10:33.080 --> 10:34.580
you were answering
my text message, and now...

10:34.648 --> 10:36.165
we're all sitting here,
and we're talking about

10:36.250 --> 10:38.251
this day that's supposed to be

10:38.318 --> 10:40.086
the most amazing
and unforgettable day

10:40.153 --> 10:42.088
of our high school lives,
and we're-we're completely

10:42.155 --> 10:44.640
ignoring the fact that
she's sitting in that chair?

10:44.708 --> 10:47.510
It's not right.

10:47.594 --> 10:49.779
It's not right,
and it shouldn't be like this.

10:49.846 --> 10:51.631
Well, maybe not, but...

10:51.682 --> 10:53.549
this is the way it is.

10:53.634 --> 10:56.769
My accident, which you did
not cause, by the way,

10:56.836 --> 11:00.223
does not define me
or ruin our senior year.

11:00.307 --> 11:02.642
I meant what I said
in the choir room.

11:02.693 --> 11:05.311
I'm not gonna dwell on this, and
neither should any of you, okay?

11:05.362 --> 11:06.395
Come here.

11:12.786 --> 11:16.606
Come on.
(chuckles) Come on.

11:18.909 --> 11:21.244
Now, we are ditching as planned.

11:22.546 --> 11:24.914
I think we should go
to Six Flags.

11:24.998 --> 11:27.032
The Lady Fabray has chosen
wisely. Six Flags it is.

11:27.084 --> 11:28.200
Meeting adjourned.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.552
Hey!

11:29.636 --> 11:31.537
Hey, Finn, can you hang back
for a sec?

11:31.588 --> 11:32.922
The Apple guy.

11:33.006 --> 11:35.057
The Facebook guy.
Abraham Lincoln.

11:35.142 --> 11:36.809
What do these guys all have
in common with us?

11:36.876 --> 11:38.711
I don't know.
They were all in a show choir?

11:38.762 --> 11:41.147
None of 'em were
taken seriously in
high school, dude.

11:41.214 --> 11:42.715
They were written off
by the world

11:42.766 --> 11:44.150
until they got
the big idea.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.985
Then bingo!
The rest is history.

11:46.052 --> 11:47.520
Okay. So what's your big idea?

11:47.571 --> 11:51.357
Lima's only got 22 pools.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.242
Southern California has
800 freaking thousand!

11:53.327 --> 11:54.560
I Googled it.

11:54.611 --> 11:57.697
So after graduation,
I'm gonna move to L.A.

11:57.748 --> 11:59.565
and expand my
pool cleaning business.

11:59.616 --> 12:01.367
And I want you to be
my business partner.

12:01.418 --> 12:02.868
With your brains
and my jaw line,

12:02.919 --> 12:04.403
I'm telling you,
we'd kill it.

12:04.454 --> 12:07.173
Wow, dude, I'm so honored
that you'd even consider me.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.574
But you know, after we graduate,

12:08.625 --> 12:10.259
I'm going to New York
with Rachel.

12:10.344 --> 12:13.713
Okay. Let's say you weren't,
just 'cause maybe she doesn't

12:13.764 --> 12:16.599
get into that fancy school
or you don't get married
right away.

12:16.683 --> 12:18.384
We are. It's gonna happen.

12:18.435 --> 12:19.418
Okay.

12:19.469 --> 12:21.721
But, hey, could
you do me a favor?

12:21.772 --> 12:23.589
Um, you know that
blonde on Sycamore Street

12:23.640 --> 12:25.608
that likes to mow
her lawn in tube tops?

12:25.692 --> 12:26.925
Yeah, Mrs. Tennison.
Yeah.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.260
Well, her Jacuzzi's busted.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.396
So, I thought since you know
so much about motors,

12:30.447 --> 12:32.481
you could take a look at it.
Help me out.

12:32.566 --> 12:34.950
Yeah. All right,
I could probably do that.

12:35.035 --> 12:36.485
(bell ringing)

12:36.570 --> 12:41.073
Lazy idiots, your leader
Will Schuester has informed me

12:41.124 --> 12:43.743
that my teaching methods
are harsh and too extreme.

12:43.794 --> 12:47.013
So I've decided to show you
what a real artist looks

12:47.080 --> 12:48.714
and acts like.

12:48.782 --> 12:52.918
Ladies and gays,
as my gift to you,

12:52.969 --> 12:54.637
which you do not deserve,

12:54.721 --> 12:57.306
I give you
Porcelain's famous brother...

12:57.391 --> 12:58.391
Actually, it's my brother.

12:58.458 --> 12:59.809
...Cooper Anderson.

13:02.062 --> 13:03.062
Thank you, Sue.

13:05.232 --> 13:06.982
Namaste.
Okay.

13:07.067 --> 13:10.019
Guys, it was just a few years
ago that I was sitting

13:10.103 --> 13:13.489
in a sad drab room like this
with dreams like yours

13:13.573 --> 13:16.308
that I thought would
never come true.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.477
But you know what?
They did.

13:18.528 --> 13:22.531
So, tomorrow, at Sue's
insistence, I will be teaching

13:22.616 --> 13:25.201
a Master class in acting
for anyone who's interested

13:25.285 --> 13:27.319
in becoming successful
in the business like me.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.587
Fantastic!

13:30.924 --> 13:32.324
Cooper, we can't
thank you enough.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.127
This is so generous of you to
share your time and expertise.

13:35.178 --> 13:37.763
Well, it's very clear that
the Anderson brothers
are very talented,

13:37.831 --> 13:40.499
and I'm sure that there were
many a family holiday

13:40.550 --> 13:42.885
where the two of you
maybe did a little duet
by the piano?

13:42.969 --> 13:45.838
Actually, it's funny that you
should mention that because

13:45.889 --> 13:47.506
Blaine and I were famous
around the neighborhood.

13:47.557 --> 13:48.841
Not famous.

13:48.892 --> 13:51.677
We were pretty famous
around the neighborhood

13:51.728 --> 13:52.978
for our dueling
Simon LeBon impressions.

13:53.029 --> 13:56.148
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please don't make me do that.

13:56.199 --> 13:57.283
Oh, no, Blaine,
you have to.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.401
You're both so
handsome and good.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.236
Come on, Blaine.
What do you say?

14:00.320 --> 14:02.321
How about a little Duran Duran?
Is that okay?

14:02.372 --> 14:03.956
Yeah.
Come on.

14:04.023 --> 14:05.825
Okay, okay, okay.

14:07.193 --> 14:08.994
You're on, Cooper.

14:09.045 --> 14:10.713
Ooh, the cardigan's
coming off.
Whoo!

Bless you.
Why do you do that?

16:33.949 --> 16:36.951
Service industry is a great
place to try out new accents.

16:37.035 --> 16:38.169
Keeps your instrument
from getting rusty.

16:38.236 --> 16:39.870
Use everything.

16:39.921 --> 16:41.339
Will do.

16:41.406 --> 16:44.208
So, nice job on
the song today.
Really nice.

16:44.259 --> 16:47.294
Oh, thank you.
You were a little
pitchy on "Rio,"

16:47.379 --> 16:49.296
and your moves lacked a theme,
though.

16:49.381 --> 16:53.050
My theme was dancing,
I guess.
But you have to give in to it.

16:53.101 --> 16:54.552
Stanislavsky says,

16:54.603 --> 16:56.721

of the body,"

but he never mentioned
that the toes are the ears.

17:00.258 --> 17:01.642
You're unbelievable.

17:01.727 --> 17:03.927
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
What?

17:03.979 --> 17:07.064
All you ever do is tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

17:07.115 --> 17:08.949
You waste no opportunity
to remind me

17:09.034 --> 17:11.117
how much I suck
at, like, everything.

17:11.203 --> 17:13.788
(Hanson's "MMMBop" playing)
No, no. Come on, Blaine.

17:13.872 --> 17:15.105
Your balance is
completely off.

17:15.156 --> 17:18.659
I just learned to walk
three years ago.

17:18.743 --> 17:21.412
If that happened, I'm so sorry.

17:21.463 --> 17:23.164
But I don't,
I don't remember it.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.248
Of course you don't.

17:24.299 --> 17:26.300
Hey, hey, little brother,

17:26.385 --> 17:29.086
I know there is an age
difference between us,

17:29.137 --> 17:31.288
But I'd really want
to be closer to you.

17:31.356 --> 17:33.724
I want to get to know you
a little better,

17:33.792 --> 17:35.926
all right?

17:35.977 --> 17:37.428
That's why I'm here.

17:37.479 --> 17:40.347
Yeah. No, I would love that.
I'd like that.

17:40.432 --> 17:41.632
Great! So you're gonna come

17:41.683 --> 17:43.100
to my Master class tomorrow,
right?

17:43.151 --> 17:44.735
<i>Right?
Yeah, sure.</i>

17:44.803 --> 17:46.270
Great. Cheers.

Top o' the morning.

17:50.192 --> 17:51.742

17:51.810 --> 17:53.277
I don't know. It's super-steep.

17:53.328 --> 17:56.163
In fact, it's the steepest
accessibility ramp in Lima.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.449
I know.
I've conquered them all.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.701
I think I'm just gonna go
to the front of the school.

18:00.786 --> 18:03.170
That ramp is nice and gentle.

18:03.255 --> 18:04.422
Quinn Fabray!

18:06.174 --> 18:08.209
I believe in you.

18:12.664 --> 18:14.098
Now come on.
(sighs)

18:14.165 --> 18:16.550
Prove me right.
You can do this.

18:16.635 --> 18:18.719
I'm not gonna make it.

18:18.804 --> 18:19.553
You will!

18:19.638 --> 18:21.105
(grunting)

18:21.172 --> 18:23.307
My arms...

18:23.358 --> 18:24.725
...are like iron! Come on!

18:24.810 --> 18:26.110
You can do it!

18:26.177 --> 18:27.311
...aren't strong like yours.

18:27.362 --> 18:28.646
Yes, you are.
Lean forward and push.

18:28.697 --> 18:30.731
(laughs)

18:30.816 --> 18:32.450
(grunting): Ow.

18:32.517 --> 18:33.984
Come on. You're halfway there.

18:34.035 --> 18:37.238
You've got this!
Push! Push!

18:37.322 --> 18:39.523
That sounds familiar.

18:39.574 --> 18:40.658
(both laugh)

18:40.709 --> 18:42.493
It's just like
having a baby. Come on.

18:42.544 --> 18:44.378
You wouldn't know!

18:44.463 --> 18:45.529
Three,

18:45.580 --> 18:47.665
BOTH:
Two...

18:47.716 --> 18:49.800
one... zero.

18:49.868 --> 18:51.802
You made it!
Whoo!

18:51.870 --> 18:52.887
Oh, my God.

18:52.971 --> 18:54.672
Whoo!

18:54.723 --> 18:56.590
(both laughing)

18:58.143 --> 18:59.560
Now just stay
up there.

18:59.644 --> 19:01.812
I would say that was one

19:01.880 --> 19:03.647
of the hardest
things I've ever done.

19:03.715 --> 19:05.215
Until you go
to Six Flags.

19:05.267 --> 19:06.884
Look, I'm not trying
to be a buzzkill,

19:06.935 --> 19:08.235
but going to an
amusement park

19:08.320 --> 19:09.603
when you're in
a wheelchair--

19:09.688 --> 19:11.105
especially if you're
still getting used to it--

19:11.189 --> 19:12.439
can kind of
be a drag.

19:12.524 --> 19:15.075
Artie, it's Senior Ditch Day.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.828
It's the only Senior Ditch Day
I'm ever going to have.

19:17.896 --> 19:20.331
I completely agree,
which is why I want you to come

19:20.398 --> 19:21.332
with me on Friday.

19:21.399 --> 19:22.783
I promise you,

19:22.868 --> 19:25.419
it will be the most amazing,
incredible and inspiring

19:25.504 --> 19:27.087
Ditch Day ever.

19:27.172 --> 19:28.172
(bell ringing)

19:28.239 --> 19:30.073
Whoo!

19:30.125 --> 19:33.511
Welcome, guys, to the Cooper
Anderson Acting Master class.

19:33.578 --> 19:34.912
Thank you. Yes.

19:34.963 --> 19:37.431
Buckle your seat belts, kids,
buckle your seat belts

19:37.516 --> 19:40.584
'cause I'm about
to pour you a tall glass of

19:40.635 --> 19:41.886
"This is how it is."

19:41.937 --> 19:43.437
First thing you're gonna
want to know:

19:43.522 --> 19:46.023
Don't go to college.
It is a waste of time.

19:46.090 --> 19:47.141
Number two:

19:47.225 --> 19:48.976
Don't go to New York.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.478
Theater is lame
and Broadway is dead.

19:51.563 --> 19:53.113
Real actors do TV and film,

19:53.198 --> 19:55.449
which means Hollywood
is where it's at.

19:55.534 --> 19:57.568
Now let's talk headshots.

19:57.619 --> 20:00.738
Always, without fail,
turn into a pose.

20:00.789 --> 20:02.289
Again.
CLASS: Wow.

20:02.374 --> 20:03.624
And again.
CLASS: Ooh...

20:03.708 --> 20:05.576
And one more time.
CLASS: Oh, yeah!

20:05.627 --> 20:07.878
Yes, that is a dynamic headshot,
and bam,

20:07.946 --> 20:10.247
you just got your first
callback. So now you've got

20:10.298 --> 20:12.333
your "sides."
Your foot's in the door.

20:12.417 --> 20:14.284
What do you do next?
Gotta figure out,

20:14.336 --> 20:16.220
is it comedic or is it dramatic?

20:16.287 --> 20:18.005
Often, it's hard to tell, right?

20:18.089 --> 20:20.123
So do what I do:
ask the director.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.642
"Is this scene comedic
or dramatic?"

20:21.726 --> 20:23.761
He will know you're an
actor who's not afraid

20:23.812 --> 20:25.262
to ask the tough questions,
right?

20:25.313 --> 20:26.847
Why are you writing this down?

20:26.932 --> 20:28.265
Okay, what's the key
to a dramatic scene?

20:28.316 --> 20:29.433
Finding the emotion.

20:29.484 --> 20:31.185
Connecting
with your scene partner.

20:31.269 --> 20:33.020
Oh, no, no and no.

20:33.104 --> 20:35.356
The key to a dramatic scene
is pointing.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.324
When people are
really emotional,

20:37.409 --> 20:40.160
they point their fingers a lot.

20:40.245 --> 20:41.862
That's not true
at all.

20:41.947 --> 20:43.313
That's... that's
terrible advice.

20:43.365 --> 20:46.083
Excuse me, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Blaine.

20:46.150 --> 20:47.835
Are you an internationally
beloved spokesman

20:47.919 --> 20:50.537
for the Internet's fastest-
growing credit score Web site?

20:50.622 --> 20:51.872
GIRL: No.

20:51.957 --> 20:53.657
I didn't think so.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.826
So let's focus in, okay?
I'm here for you.

20:55.877 --> 20:57.428
I don't normally do this,

20:57.495 --> 20:59.513
but because you're in brother's
class and you guys are so nice,

20:59.598 --> 21:01.131
I'm gonna give you some
Level II stuff.

21:01.182 --> 21:04.101
(excited chatter)

21:09.007 --> 21:10.941
The secret to great acting,

21:11.009 --> 21:12.576
<i>great acting:</i>

21:12.644 --> 21:16.530
ignoring whatever
the other actor is doing.

21:16.615 --> 21:20.234
Eye contact with a scene partner
is incredibly distracting.

21:20.318 --> 21:21.952
I try to tune them out entirely.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.203
Sometimes I wear earplugs.

21:23.288 --> 21:25.039
That way, I don't get distracted
by what

21:25.123 --> 21:29.860
they're doing, and I can focus
on the awesome acting choices

21:29.911 --> 21:31.194
I've planned ahead of time.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.830
Like eating
a roast beef sandwich, right?

21:32.881 --> 21:35.532
Other choices I can plan
ahead of time:

21:35.583 --> 21:36.834
screaming all my lines!

21:36.885 --> 21:39.036
Because I'm really intense.

21:39.087 --> 21:40.871
And the things
I'm feeling are really intense!

21:40.922 --> 21:42.172
Because I'm an intense actor!

21:42.223 --> 21:43.057
(laughter)

21:43.141 --> 21:45.709
Nicholas Cage, right?!

21:45.760 --> 21:48.378
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!

21:49.547 --> 21:50.213
Bravo.

21:51.983 --> 21:54.485
All right, guys, I don't want
you to go cray-cray,

21:54.552 --> 21:58.221
but I brought in "sides--"
industry term--

21:58.273 --> 22:01.025
from a little show that
I auditioned for last week...

22:01.076 --> 22:02.392
<i>called NCIS.</i>

22:02.444 --> 22:03.610
What does that stand for?
(students murmuring)

22:03.695 --> 22:05.162
Oh, my nana loves that show!

22:06.898 --> 22:10.451
Now in this scene, Agent Sciuto
has just discovered a dead body.

22:10.535 --> 22:12.235
Who knows what will unfold?

22:12.287 --> 22:13.537
Don't look at each other.
Action.

22:13.588 --> 22:14.738
Here's what we know.

22:14.806 --> 22:16.206
Sergeant Pembroke
took a bullet

22:16.257 --> 22:17.424
at point-blank range.
What we don't know

22:17.509 --> 22:19.043
is why he's wearing a dress.

22:19.094 --> 22:20.511
There's a rumor that Sergeant
Pembroke was a transvestite.

22:20.578 --> 22:21.912
No, Blaine, say
the line again,

22:21.963 --> 22:23.297
but this time,
point your finger.

22:23.381 --> 22:24.915
Things are serious; a
man in a dress is dead.

22:24.966 --> 22:26.100
I don't really
feel like pointing, Coop.

22:26.184 --> 22:27.718
Just feels a little stupid.

22:27.769 --> 22:29.753
Well, when a choice feels wrong,
it's actually a good sign.

22:29.804 --> 22:31.188
It means you're right
on the edge, man.

22:31.255 --> 22:33.023
See, I don't know about that.
I feel like when a choice...

22:33.091 --> 22:34.441
(both arguing)

22:34.526 --> 22:36.193
Coop, you're my brother!

22:36.260 --> 22:38.562
Can't you just support me?

22:40.115 --> 22:42.733
I'm sorry, are you
talking to me right now?

22:42.784 --> 22:44.451
Because I can't tell
if you're talking to me

22:44.536 --> 22:46.453
if you don't
point your finger.

22:46.538 --> 22:47.871
Right?
(students murmuring agreement)

22:47.939 --> 22:50.124
That is lesson number one,
guys, right?

22:50.208 --> 22:51.575
Scene. Scene. Scene.

22:51.626 --> 22:52.659
Good work, buddy.

22:52.744 --> 22:53.744
We'll get 'em
next time.

22:53.795 --> 22:55.329
Let's go! Whoo!
Let's move on

22:55.413 --> 22:57.965
to a little acting exercise
that I like to call

22:58.049 --> 22:59.800
The Emotion Tornado.

22:59.884 --> 23:01.218
Get your hands
up to the sky...

23:02.670 --> 23:04.755
Just a busted control
panel, Mrs. Tennison.

23:04.806 --> 23:05.806
Nothing too serious.

23:05.890 --> 23:07.124
You're a lifesaver.

23:07.175 --> 23:08.291
Noah told me
you're going

23:08.343 --> 23:09.343
into business together.

23:09.427 --> 23:11.678
No, I said we were
thinking about it.

23:11.763 --> 23:12.930
Well, I think it's a great idea.

23:12.981 --> 23:14.131
And if you need any investors,

23:14.182 --> 23:16.016
I'd love to be a
silent partner.

23:16.101 --> 23:17.968
Or a noisy one.

23:22.757 --> 23:24.875
In California,
she's considered ugly.

23:27.078 --> 23:29.847
Dude, I'm not going to L.A.

23:29.914 --> 23:31.215
Okay, end of discussion.

23:31.266 --> 23:33.383
Let me just say this,
and I'll shut up forever.

23:33.435 --> 23:35.018
If getting hitched
is a team effort,

23:35.086 --> 23:36.419
why are you the one that's
always giving up everything?

23:36.471 --> 23:37.587
Maybe it's time
for Rachel to start

23:37.639 --> 23:38.605
thinking about you
for a change.

23:38.690 --> 23:39.923
It's not like
you're asking her

23:39.974 --> 23:41.191
to sacrifice her career.

23:41.259 --> 23:42.476
You heard Blaine's
famous brother.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.228
L.A. is where it's at.

23:44.279 --> 23:45.428
Rachel could probably
get on TV,

23:45.480 --> 23:46.763
play the quirky
next-door girl or whatever.

23:46.815 --> 23:48.482
And you could
try acting, too.

23:48.566 --> 23:50.951
Or go to college.
This could be your day job.

23:51.035 --> 23:52.870
You spend so much time
thinking only about her.

23:52.937 --> 23:55.405
Take a couple seconds
and think about yourself.

23:58.015 --> 23:58.015
+

23:58.927 --> 24:00.094
I can barely focus.

24:00.178 --> 24:01.679
The thought of a boy
clinging to my insides

24:01.746 --> 24:03.264
is making me even more nauseous.

24:03.348 --> 24:05.549
Sue, maybe you should wait to
find out the sex of the baby.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.934
Besides, boys aren't
so bad anyway.

24:07.018 --> 24:08.552
They're disgusting.

24:08.603 --> 24:10.137
They have terrible aim when
peeing, they're weak-minded,

24:10.222 --> 24:11.856
and when will someone
give me a straight answer

24:11.923 --> 24:13.023
as to why they have nipples?

24:13.091 --> 24:14.091
Sue Sylvester.

24:15.060 --> 24:18.095
Right this way, please.

24:20.315 --> 24:21.866
I'm sorry,
is this the father?

24:21.933 --> 24:23.117
Uh, no, no.
God, no.

24:23.201 --> 24:25.653
Uh, these are...
these are my friends.

24:25.737 --> 24:26.904
Mm-hmm.

24:26.955 --> 24:28.605
Sounds so weird coming
out of my mouth.

24:28.657 --> 24:30.607
Here for moral support?
Yes, exactly.

24:30.659 --> 24:32.543
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

24:32.610 --> 24:33.911
DOCTOR:
Okay.

24:33.962 --> 24:35.913
Well, looking at
your test results,

24:35.964 --> 24:37.781
your baby is a girl.

24:37.833 --> 24:38.782
Yes!
Ah!
A girl!

24:38.834 --> 24:39.950
Come on, now.
(all laughing)

24:40.001 --> 24:41.085
There we go.

24:41.136 --> 24:42.119
Oh, my toilet
seats are spared.

24:42.170 --> 24:44.454
However...

24:45.507 --> 24:46.891
However?

24:46.958 --> 24:49.960
Your amnio came back
with irregularities.

24:54.299 --> 24:56.100
So, Coop, have you met
George Clooney?
Not yet.

24:56.151 --> 24:57.518
But I have had sex

24:57.602 --> 24:59.737
with the Progressive
Insurance lady.
Perfect.

24:59.804 --> 25:01.021
Don't be a stranger,
all right?

25:01.106 --> 25:02.773
Follow me on Twitter.
All right.

25:02.824 --> 25:03.741
Tweet me.

25:03.808 --> 25:05.826
Yeah!

25:05.911 --> 25:07.528
Ask me why I am
so happy, Squirt.

25:07.612 --> 25:08.779
Don't call me that.

25:08.830 --> 25:10.331
My life just
completely changed.

25:10.415 --> 25:12.666
I just got an audition
for a Michael Bay movie.

25:12.751 --> 25:13.918
Oh, that's great.

25:13.985 --> 25:15.586
Hello? Did you hear me?
Michael freakin' Bay.

25:15.653 --> 25:17.087
The movie's untitled,

25:17.155 --> 25:20.674
<i>which you know is code
for Transformers 4.</i>

25:20.759 --> 25:22.343
You don't seem
very happy for me.

25:22.427 --> 25:23.493
Oh, I'm thrilled.

25:23.545 --> 25:24.962
Well, you got
a weird way of showing it.

25:25.013 --> 25:26.380
It wouldn't
kill you to smile.

25:26.464 --> 25:28.165
Also wouldn't kill you
to stop letting Kurt

25:28.216 --> 25:29.183
pick out your clothes.

25:29.267 --> 25:30.217
He d-does not.

25:30.302 --> 25:31.518
Mm-hmm, could've fooled me.

25:31.603 --> 25:32.887
Come on, man,
we'll have our own ditch day.

25:32.971 --> 25:34.438
You can help me run lines.

25:34.505 --> 25:37.224
It's all about
you, isn't it?

25:37.309 --> 25:40.227
Well, you know what, big
brother, I'm sick of it.

25:40.312 --> 25:42.279
And I'm not going
to take it anymore.

25:42.347 --> 25:43.647
(Christina Aguilera's
"Fighter" playing)

25:43.698 --> 25:45.065

My toes.
I'm sorry, man.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.620
Hey.

28:03.671 --> 28:05.489
What were you doing?

28:05.540 --> 28:06.590
Uh, texting...
Texting while walking.

28:06.657 --> 28:08.175
That's exactly
how I started.

28:08.259 --> 28:10.010
Well, I don't usually
text while...
Think about it.

28:10.095 --> 28:12.179
You know, luckily enough,
the guy that crashed into me

28:12.263 --> 28:14.431
while I was texting is fine,
but, you know, I...

28:14.499 --> 28:15.482
Okay.
You should really

28:15.550 --> 28:17.000
not do that anymore.

28:17.052 --> 28:18.168
No more texting, okay?

28:18.219 --> 28:19.553
Well, unless
I'm in class

28:19.637 --> 28:21.972
or, you know, on the toilet
or at a movie or something.

28:22.023 --> 28:23.273
Thank you.

28:23.341 --> 28:24.608
What's going on?

28:24.675 --> 28:26.560
Oh, well,
that's funny you're here.

28:26.644 --> 28:28.062
I was just, uh,

28:28.146 --> 28:29.980
confirming the ditch day
amusement park ticket order...

28:30.031 --> 28:31.181
Oh, count us out.

28:31.232 --> 28:32.616
What? Why?

28:32.683 --> 28:35.869
Because we have a super special
senior ditch day planned,

28:35.954 --> 28:36.987
Artie Abrams style.

28:37.038 --> 28:38.288
Isn't that right, Artie?

28:38.356 --> 28:39.490
That's right.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.203
quietly mouth breathing and
reeking from this morning's

28:51.254 --> 28:54.340
maple-y toaster pastries that
you're not interrupting me?

28:54.391 --> 28:56.509
What do you want, Jackson?
Spit it out.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.260
I heard about your baby.

29:01.431 --> 29:02.398
You did?

29:02.482 --> 29:03.566
Yeah.

29:03.650 --> 29:06.352
I heard you're having
a baby girl.

29:06.403 --> 29:08.320
Yeah.

29:08.388 --> 29:09.405
Just like you.

29:09.489 --> 29:10.523
Come here.

29:10.574 --> 29:14.126
Just like you.

29:14.194 --> 29:15.528
Dang, Coach.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.229
Don't start lactating.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.865
Can I give you
a parenting tip?

29:19.916 --> 29:22.284
Sure.

what we're doing here?

29:39.469 --> 29:40.519
Just follow me.
It's up here.

29:42.755 --> 29:44.356
What is this?

29:44.424 --> 29:46.525

This was a really great
Senior Ditch Day.

32:12.255 --> 32:13.672
You were right.
I just wanted you

32:13.740 --> 32:15.090
to meet a cool
group of people

32:15.175 --> 32:17.909
having a great time in
the same situation as you.

32:17.961 --> 32:21.296
Yeah, but I'm not...

32:21.381 --> 32:22.748
This is only temporary.

32:22.799 --> 32:24.850
The doctor said
it's a matter of time before...

where you are.

32:26.136 --> 32:27.269

You're not me.

32:31.725 --> 32:33.091
Okay?

32:33.143 --> 32:35.044
I'm not like you.
This isn't my life.

32:35.111 --> 32:37.429
I'm going to Yale,
I'm getting out of Lima,

32:37.480 --> 32:39.264
and I'm going to walk again.

32:39.315 --> 32:40.616
And what if you don't?

32:40.700 --> 32:42.267
When are you going
to stop pretending

32:42.318 --> 32:44.069
that this isn't really
happening to you?

+

32:48.826 --> 32:50.710
(school bell ringing)

32:50.795 --> 32:52.629
No, no.

32:52.696 --> 32:55.415
Maybe you should
request a lower locker.

32:55.499 --> 32:57.033
Could be easier.

32:57.084 --> 32:59.386
No. This has always
been my locker

32:59.470 --> 33:02.756
and will continue to be
until I walk across that stage

33:02.840 --> 33:04.591
in my cap and gown
and get my diploma.

33:04.675 --> 33:06.309
I gotta get to class.

33:06.377 --> 33:07.260
Can I walk with you?

33:08.429 --> 33:09.930
I've been praying for you.

33:10.014 --> 33:13.400
Well, guess it could help for
God to hear from a few people.

33:13.484 --> 33:16.102
I've been praying to walk again,
as well.

33:16.187 --> 33:18.822
Oh, I don't pray
for you to walk.

33:18.889 --> 33:21.274
I ask God to help you accept
whatever your journey may be.

33:21.359 --> 33:24.945
I appreciate your prayers--
I do--

33:25.029 --> 33:26.997
but when you're done praying,

33:27.064 --> 33:29.732
you get to get up off your knees
and walk away.

33:33.337 --> 33:34.788
Sorry.

33:34.872 --> 33:36.873
Self-obsessed bitch.

33:36.924 --> 33:38.208
It's cool.

33:41.262 --> 33:43.246
You know what...

33:43.297 --> 33:44.931
you're really inspiring.

33:45.016 --> 33:47.217
And I feel like you've
been inspiring to a

33:47.268 --> 33:48.635
few other people I know.

33:48.719 --> 33:50.053
What are you doing after school
today?

33:50.104 --> 33:51.471
(whistle blows)

33:51.555 --> 33:54.190
All right, fair warning:
in the glorious history of

33:54.258 --> 33:56.192
Booty Camp,
this will be the toughest!

33:56.260 --> 33:57.811
But first, Quinn's
got the floor.

33:57.895 --> 33:59.562
I invited a friend to join us.

33:59.613 --> 34:01.197
You met him on Valentine's Day.

34:01.265 --> 34:03.483
Teen Jesus!
QUINN: He's got a killer voice.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.535
Whoo!
Okay, all right.

34:05.602 --> 34:07.270
Welcome to the New Directions.

34:07.321 --> 34:09.322
Hey, dude, you have
a twig in your hair.

34:09.407 --> 34:10.456
No, seriously.

34:10.541 --> 34:13.208
WILL: Okay.
Thanks, bro.

34:13.277 --> 34:15.078
Let's give our undivided
attention to Coach Sue.

34:16.464 --> 34:19.666
First off, please don't ask me
which celebrity is the father

34:19.750 --> 34:21.301
of my baby. Please.

34:21.385 --> 34:23.953
I will release that information
once I've finalized my book

34:24.005 --> 34:25.304
and movie deal.

34:25.389 --> 34:28.391
Now, it has come to my attention
that I have been a tad

34:28.458 --> 34:31.143
harsh with some of you.

34:31.228 --> 34:33.013
I thought I was being kind.

34:33.097 --> 34:35.514
For instance,
I said absolutely nothing

34:35.599 --> 34:37.851
about the implausible
sexual tension

34:37.935 --> 34:39.985
between Mercedes and the
Kentucky Fried Stripper.

34:40.071 --> 34:43.139
Or the sorry fact that you
wasted untold millions

34:43.190 --> 34:46.159
on a laser show for yourselves
just so Sandbags could dance

34:46.243 --> 34:48.194
with the night school's
Polynesian janitor.

34:48.279 --> 34:49.829
Actually, he was
Puerto Rican.

34:49.914 --> 34:53.033
Kids, it's in my DNA
to be intense, okay,

34:53.117 --> 34:56.002
just like it's in Porcelain's
DNA to poop rainbow glitter.

34:56.087 --> 34:58.755
Now, I'll admit
I-I behaved badly.

34:58.822 --> 35:00.590
I also realized something.

35:00.657 --> 35:03.877
I am here
for two very important reasons.

35:03.961 --> 35:06.329
Number one: Mr. Schuester needs
at least one adult friend.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.098
And number two:

35:08.165 --> 35:12.685
I am hoping that the miraculous
life growing inside of me

35:12.770 --> 35:17.057
can soak up some of your
constantly annoying,

35:17.141 --> 35:21.861
though admittedly laudable,
optimism and decency.

35:25.699 --> 35:27.150
Now, I promise to be nicer

35:27.201 --> 35:30.236
if you promise to work your
talented little butts off

35:30.321 --> 35:32.705
until they hand you that
first-place trophy in Chicago.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.657
All right, sloppy babies,

35:34.708 --> 35:37.160
let's take it from the top.

35:37.211 --> 35:39.162
Five, six, seven, eight!

35:39.213 --> 35:40.196
(whistle blows)
(bell ringing)

35:40.247 --> 35:42.365
Hello.

35:42.416 --> 35:44.751
I'm Margaret Thatcher Dog.

35:44.835 --> 35:47.637
My relationship with
the Queen was ruff!

35:47.704 --> 35:48.972
(chuckling)

35:49.039 --> 35:50.807
Oh, look what Finn won
you playing skeeball.

35:50.874 --> 35:52.375
Finn won this?

35:52.426 --> 35:54.344
Yeah. Well, Rachel kept making
him win stuffed animals for her,

35:54.395 --> 35:56.646
and at the end of the
day, out of the 14

35:56.713 --> 36:00.016
she had, I confiscated this
little guy to give to you.

36:00.067 --> 36:02.268
Since there
was no convincing
you coming with us.

36:02.353 --> 36:04.737
I would've just
brought you guys down.

36:04.822 --> 36:08.108
Look, I get it:
family stuff is hard,

36:08.192 --> 36:09.492
especially between brothers.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.945
I mean, Finn and I
are not even real brothers,

36:12.029 --> 36:13.863
and we pretty much
disagree on everything,

36:13.914 --> 36:15.731
but I love the big lug.

36:15.783 --> 36:19.252
And at the end of the day,
we're in each other's corners.

36:19.336 --> 36:21.171
You only get one
brother, Blaine.

36:21.238 --> 36:22.288
Don't give up on that.

36:22.373 --> 36:23.623
He's the one that's leaving.

36:23.707 --> 36:25.074
Huge audition,
you didn't hear about it?

36:25.126 --> 36:26.909
Actually, he hasn't left yet.

36:26.961 --> 36:28.845
He's in the auditorium,

36:28.912 --> 36:30.413
hoping that you'll come
and talk to him.

36:30.464 --> 36:32.348
I've tried talking to him.

36:32.416 --> 36:34.250
Doesn't... doesn't really
work with him.

36:34.301 --> 36:36.719
Maybe talking is not the answer.

36:36.770 --> 36:38.721
Maybe you need
to show him

36:38.772 --> 36:43.059
how you really feel in the best,
most honest way you know how.

36:48.866 --> 36:51.651

(song ends)

39:21.552 --> 39:23.753
Best you've
ever sounded.

39:23.804 --> 39:26.189
I am tough on you.

39:26.256 --> 39:29.525
This week, maybe, a little
tougher than I should've been,

39:29.593 --> 39:31.794
and I need to apologize
for that.

39:31.862 --> 39:35.448
But it's only because I see--

39:35.532 --> 39:37.283
I've always seen--

39:37.368 --> 39:40.203
how insanely talented you are.

39:40.270 --> 39:43.239
I want you to be as successful
as you can be, Blaine,

39:43.290 --> 39:44.240
and you will be.

39:44.291 --> 39:45.458
You're gonna do it all--

39:45.542 --> 39:49.579
movies, concerts...
Broadway.

39:49.630 --> 39:51.714
Even though it's dead?

39:51.782 --> 39:53.216
You'll resurrect it.

39:53.283 --> 39:55.718
And when I'm in the audience,
watching you,

39:55.786 --> 39:58.120
I want to be able to say,
"That's my kid brother up there.

39:58.172 --> 40:00.556
I helped him get there."

40:00.624 --> 40:02.175
Thanks for saying that, Coop.

40:02.259 --> 40:05.144
And I know you really
mean it, too, because

40:05.229 --> 40:08.014
you weren't pointing
your finger at me or...
Okay, okay.

40:08.098 --> 40:11.434
(shouting): speaking
really loudly

40:11.485 --> 40:13.102
(laughing)
to be intense.

40:13.153 --> 40:15.772
I'm really glad we
could sing together

40:15.823 --> 40:17.640
one last time
before you left

40:17.691 --> 40:18.908
to be Mr. Hollywood.

40:18.975 --> 40:21.577
Actually, my audition
got canceled.

40:21.645 --> 40:24.864
What?
I don't know.
Apparently, Michael Bay

40:24.948 --> 40:27.149
just decided to go
in a different direction,

40:27.201 --> 40:28.868
which is industry-speak

40:28.952 --> 40:30.286
for "Thanks, but we found

40:30.337 --> 40:32.171
somebody who's better
and/or hotter."

40:32.256 --> 40:34.257
Okay, first of all,
y-you don't know that.

40:34.324 --> 40:38.010
And second of all,
screw Optimus Prime.

40:38.095 --> 40:40.546
Even though we don't live
in the same town,

40:40.631 --> 40:43.833
and we don't see
each other all the time,

40:43.884 --> 40:45.668
we're not just
brothers, right?

40:48.055 --> 40:50.106
We're friends, too?

40:50.174 --> 40:55.194
That's... exactly what I've
always wanted us to be, Coop.

41:00.734 --> 41:02.685
Hold on a second.
I just, uh,

41:02.736 --> 41:04.687
I want to remember
this emotion

41:04.738 --> 41:07.039
so I can use it
in a scene someday.

41:07.124 --> 41:08.040
You are ridiculous.

41:08.125 --> 41:09.792
You never know, right?

41:09.860 --> 41:11.794
Hey, I want to,
I want to help you.

41:11.862 --> 41:13.296
I don't want you
to give up on this audition.

41:13.363 --> 41:15.248
Come on, I got an idea.
Where are we going?

41:15.332 --> 41:19.201
We are going to put you on tape
so Michael Bay can see

41:19.253 --> 41:21.087
what real acting is.

41:21.171 --> 41:22.088
Pointing.

41:22.172 --> 41:23.172
Nice touch.

41:23.223 --> 41:25.308
See, I believe that.

41:25.375 --> 41:27.059
That's why it's
lesson number one.

41:27.144 --> 41:28.644
(bell ringing)
Hey.

41:28.712 --> 41:30.680
So how do you think I did
in Cooper's Master class?

41:30.731 --> 41:34.383
You made it seem like you
discover dead bodies every day.

41:34.435 --> 41:36.452
If that was a real part,
you would've got it.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.771
(sighs) So the NYADA scout
is gonna be hereoon.

41:38.856 --> 41:41.607
I'm pretty sure
I'm ready for it.

41:41.692 --> 41:45.027
Have you ever thought about
what I'm gonna do in New York?

41:45.078 --> 41:48.397
Well, one thing I know
is for certain is, we'll
figure it out together.

41:48.449 --> 41:49.916
Well, that's really nice,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.869
but I... I feel like I need
to start thinking seriously

41:52.920 --> 41:54.620
about what's next for me.

41:54.705 --> 41:56.071
You ever thought
about California?

41:56.123 --> 41:57.406
I just, I feel
like there's,

41:57.458 --> 41:59.792
there's so many more
opportunities for me there.

41:59.877 --> 42:03.346
And Puck, he's got this
really great pool-cleaning
business opportunity.

42:03.413 --> 42:05.348
And you could audition
for your actor jobs

42:05.415 --> 42:07.934
and you wouldn't even have
to worry about money,

42:08.018 --> 42:09.585
because I'd be able
to support you

42:09.636 --> 42:11.687
you know, as... as
your husband and...
Finn...

42:11.755 --> 42:13.589
what are you doing?

42:13.657 --> 42:15.107
Well, I'm thinking
about my future.

42:15.192 --> 42:18.027
I thought it was our future.

42:18.094 --> 42:19.479
Of course. Of course, it is

42:19.563 --> 42:20.780
our future,
And...

42:20.864 --> 42:22.398
but it feels like

42:22.449 --> 42:24.283
the conversation's
been a little...

42:24.368 --> 42:25.651
one-sided lately.

42:27.287 --> 42:28.955
Look, even Blaine's
brother said

42:29.039 --> 42:30.573
you know, Hollywood is where
you want to go
No, I'm not...

42:30.624 --> 42:31.941
if you want
to be famous
I'm not...

42:31.992 --> 42:34.377
as an actress.
a Hollywood
actress, okay?

42:34.444 --> 42:36.712
In New York, New York
is about the work that you do

42:36.780 --> 42:38.714
and not the work
that you've had done.

42:38.782 --> 42:41.000
There's no other option
here for me, okay?

42:41.084 --> 42:42.134
I am Broadway bound.
Right,

42:42.219 --> 42:43.803
but if I'm going to
be your husband,

42:43.887 --> 42:45.221
shouldn't I have
something to say
about it, too?
"If"?

42:45.288 --> 42:47.056
Just seems like you don't
care about my dreams.

42:47.123 --> 42:48.007
I care.
Of course I care.

42:48.091 --> 42:49.392
Right, of course you care

42:49.459 --> 42:51.060
as long as they don't
interfere with yours.

42:51.127 --> 42:52.595
Look, I need to
be in New York,

42:52.646 --> 42:53.829
and I need you with me.

42:53.897 --> 42:56.599
I can't do this without you.

42:56.650 --> 42:59.602
I just want you
to be really sure.

42:59.653 --> 43:01.237
I just want you to
be really sure

43:01.304 --> 43:02.471
that you're in
love with me

43:02.523 --> 43:03.856
and not who you
want me to be.
