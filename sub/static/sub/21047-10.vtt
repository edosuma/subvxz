<i>Previously on "Blood drive"...</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:08.273
<i>Just gonna pop these little
guys out of our heads.</i>

00:08.313 --> 00:09.946
Shit, you're hurt.

00:09.948 --> 00:11.414
He needs more blood
than you can give.

00:11.416 --> 00:15.151
Are you prepared to die?
- What do you think?

00:15.153 --> 00:17.486
<i>Our connection caused
a kernel boot error.</i>

00:18.122 --> 00:20.189
What does that even mean?

00:20.191 --> 00:23.392
- It means I love you.
- You're becoming human.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.530
Arthur?

00:27.532 --> 00:29.498
Arthur!

01:10.774 --> 01:13.342
Lemonade!
Get your lemonade!

01:13.344 --> 01:15.444
Howdy, traveler.
Lemonade?

01:22.019 --> 01:25.521
Daddy!

01:25.523 --> 01:30.259
Hey! nobody steals
from my girls.

01:30.261 --> 01:31.594
Sorry.

01:37.501 --> 01:39.568
I'm just joshing.

01:39.570 --> 01:45.307
Jeff Warrens. You can call me
Warrens, JW, J-Dubs.

01:45.309 --> 01:48.377
- Arthur.
- It's a pleasure, Arty man.

01:48.379 --> 01:51.280
Now, I'm sure you've seen a lot
out there in that wasteland,

01:51.282 --> 01:54.550
but don't worry,
you're safe from the Scar here.

01:54.552 --> 01:59.388
Welcome to Cronenburgh!

02:50.574 --> 02:53.209
I'll be back, baby.

03:03.321 --> 03:06.155
God damn it, Barbie.
Where are you?

03:15.133 --> 03:17.199
- Unbelievable.
- What?

03:17.201 --> 03:19.502
I'm surprised you're even
alive this close to the Scar.

03:19.504 --> 03:21.237
We got folks coming in
from all over,

03:21.239 --> 03:23.472
looking for a fresh start.

03:23.474 --> 03:25.241
Looking for
a way out of their funk.

03:25.243 --> 03:29.211
- Do they find it?
- They never leave.

03:29.213 --> 03:31.747
Something amazing happens
when you allow yourself

03:31.749 --> 03:34.617
to see the beauty in everything.

03:34.619 --> 03:38.587
Everything starts seeing
the beauty in you.

03:38.589 --> 03:40.623
You smell that?

03:40.625 --> 03:44.627
Smells like cinnamon toast.

03:44.629 --> 03:49.365
Or a gas leak.
That's just our construction.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.534
Pardon our dust.
This close to the Scar,

03:51.536 --> 03:54.303
we gotta patch up small cracks
from the occasional tremors.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.372
Nothing to worry about.

03:56.374 --> 03:58.574
I hope I'm not being
too forward,

03:58.576 --> 04:01.310
but it seems to me
like you're a man

04:01.312 --> 04:03.646
looking for a sense of purpose.

04:03.648 --> 04:07.283
Maybe Cronenburgh's just the
place for a man like you.

04:07.285 --> 04:10.252
Thanks, but my life is
complicated right now.

04:10.254 --> 04:12.321
Nothing complicated here,
though.

04:12.323 --> 04:15.324
There's friendly faces

04:15.326 --> 04:18.260
safe from the pain
of that world.

04:18.262 --> 04:21.297
You know, we're having a town
party tonight at the church.

04:21.298 --> 04:23.632
I'm sure everybody'd
love to meet you.

04:23.634 --> 04:25.501
I'm not really
in the best shape.

04:25.503 --> 04:28.404
Ah, come on.
That's just a scratch.

04:28.406 --> 04:33.242
You don't need a doctor.
You need a party.

04:39.617 --> 04:40.683
Sorry, ma'am.

04:40.685 --> 04:44.453
The last guy cleaned us all out.

04:44.455 --> 04:48.791
"Ma'am," okay.
How about I give you

04:48.793 --> 04:51.794
$2 to never call me that again?

04:51.796 --> 04:57.700
And 27 cents to take me
to your last customer.

04:57.702 --> 05:02.238
As requested,
the god has arrived.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.240
I know you don't like
too much song and dance,

05:04.242 --> 05:06.442
so let's get right down
to the pitch.

05:06.444 --> 05:09.445
I've got sequels, spin-offs,
tie-in comic books

05:09.447 --> 05:11.614
to explain away all
this weird mythology.

05:14.417 --> 05:16.619
Okay, how about a video game?

05:16.621 --> 05:19.622
We didn't bring you here
to pitch.

05:19.624 --> 05:21.857
We found a loophole
in your contract

05:21.859 --> 05:26.795
that gets us around
this holding deal.

05:26.797 --> 05:30.766
Slink, you're fired.

05:38.608 --> 05:41.443
Grace and Arthur have been
testing off the charts,

05:41.445 --> 05:42.745
and you lost them.
- Why are you

05:42.747 --> 05:45.648
so hung up on those two?

05:45.650 --> 05:47.850
I know what my audience wants.

05:47.852 --> 05:51.053
Testing is for the weak
and feeble brain.

05:51.055 --> 05:53.722
Those weak and feeble test
groups were the only reason

05:53.724 --> 05:55.624
we kept the race going at all.

05:55.626 --> 05:58.394
Arthur and Grace, they've
disappeared into the Scar.

05:58.396 --> 06:01.363
They're dead and gone.
You'd better hope not.

06:01.365 --> 06:04.333
Right now, you're just fired.

06:04.335 --> 06:07.503
But if we can't get those two
back on the road,

06:07.505 --> 06:10.339
I will run your show
into the ground

06:10.341 --> 06:12.808
and make you watch
every single moment

06:12.810 --> 06:16.312
with your eyelids stapled
to your skull.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.893
Grace.

06:30.895 --> 06:32.661
You look mad.
I'm sorry I left you...

06:34.799 --> 06:36.498
oh, don't worry.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.334
I don't hold grudges.

06:40.637 --> 06:43.605
So I gave you half my blood
and this is how you thank me?

06:43.607 --> 06:45.808
I'm glad you're okay.

06:45.810 --> 06:47.810
But I'm...

06:47.812 --> 06:51.447
Kinda doing my own thing now.

06:51.449 --> 06:54.383
Isn't this great?

06:54.385 --> 06:55.851
Hey, pro tip.

06:55.853 --> 06:58.954
Next time you try
to abandon someone,

06:58.956 --> 07:04.693
don't leave a breadcrumb trail
of lost pages.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.695
I didn't lose it.

07:06.697 --> 07:09.365
I'm done with it.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.501
And you should be too.

07:12.503 --> 07:13.936
Wait, but why?

07:13.938 --> 07:15.938
This is the stuff that's gonna
help us take down Heart.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.639
What's the point?

07:17.641 --> 07:21.143
Oh, I don't know. That they're evil
and they need to be stopped.

07:21.145 --> 07:23.846
What the hell happened
to you at that restaurant?

07:23.848 --> 07:26.749
This isn't you.

07:26.751 --> 07:30.853
Say we take down Heart and arrest 
all the people that killed Karma.

07:30.855 --> 07:34.690
Then what? World's still
a pretty crappy place.

07:34.692 --> 07:39.928
There's no end game.
So maybe we just stop

07:39.930 --> 07:42.398
when we find somewhere nice.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.603
Why can't you just accept
when good things happen?

07:47.605 --> 07:51.006
I mean, look around.
- At what? Greenery?

07:51.008 --> 07:53.809
Perfect houses?
- Oh, boy.

07:53.811 --> 07:56.612
The offensive number
of floral headbands?

07:56.614 --> 07:58.747
- Here we go.
- Arthur, stop.

07:58.749 --> 08:00.616
Whatever it is that these
Stepford assholes

08:00.618 --> 08:02.851
are trying to sell you on,

08:02.853 --> 08:06.622
don't buy it.
No.

08:06.624 --> 08:10.759
No one's selling me anything.

08:10.761 --> 08:12.961
I like it here.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.730
No, you're just not
thinking straight.

08:14.732 --> 08:18.000
Are you sure? I mean, maybe
this is all a reward.

08:18.002 --> 08:19.835
- For what?
- For all of the shit

08:19.837 --> 08:21.837
that we've been through.

08:31.781 --> 08:34.015
I have an idea.

08:34.018 --> 08:37.653
Before you pass judgment,

08:37.655 --> 08:41.056
come to a party with me.

08:46.564 --> 08:50.632
Reeks like Jersey in here.

08:50.634 --> 08:52.768
I mean, what is
that delightful smell?

08:52.770 --> 08:54.803
It's something from
the construction.

08:54.805 --> 08:56.738
So glad you could join us.

08:56.740 --> 08:59.041
And you brought a plus one.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.076
And who is this
ravishing goddess?

09:01.078 --> 09:02.678
Her name is Grace

09:02.680 --> 09:04.646
and she can speak
all by herself.

09:04.648 --> 09:05.848
How rude of me.

09:05.850 --> 09:08.650
Grace is my traveling companion.

09:08.652 --> 09:12.488
Mm, I can tell
she's entertaining company.

09:12.490 --> 09:13.755
Oh, you can say that again.

09:13.757 --> 09:16.058
Oh, and here is
the man of the hour.

09:16.060 --> 09:17.993
This whole night is all for him.

09:17.995 --> 09:19.995
This is our town cobbler, David,

09:19.997 --> 09:22.698
and his peach of a wife,
Melanie.

09:22.700 --> 09:26.034
Oh, stop. Dad says that
about all his daughters.

09:26.036 --> 09:31.039
Guilty. But really,
Mel bell is something special.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.676
Arthur and Grace here
might be our newest residents.

09:34.678 --> 09:36.578
- Welcome to Cronenburgh.
- Thank you so much

09:36.580 --> 09:38.046
for having us...
what's wrong

09:38.048 --> 09:39.681
with this picture?

09:39.683 --> 09:40.716
You don't have
a drink in your hand.

09:40.718 --> 09:41.884
Oh.

09:52.729 --> 09:57.599
May I freshen you up?

09:57.601 --> 09:59.968
Man, you do not
take a hint, do you?

09:59.970 --> 10:03.739
What the hell? More free booze
never hurt anyone.

10:03.741 --> 10:05.874
You know, I can tell
you think that

10:05.876 --> 10:09.011
this is too good to be true.

10:09.013 --> 10:12.014
But that doesn't mean
you don't deserve it.

10:12.016 --> 10:13.849
We just met.

10:13.851 --> 10:15.951
How the hell do you
know what I deserve?

10:15.953 --> 10:17.819
I can smell it.

10:21.891 --> 10:24.927
Can't you?
I can smell something.

10:27.664 --> 10:32.601
How do you get stuff to grow
so close to the Scar?

10:32.603 --> 10:33.835
You were saying?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.675
I can't remember.

10:39.677 --> 10:41.944
I-I'm so sorry.

10:41.946 --> 10:44.880
I apologize for being
so rude earlier.

10:44.882 --> 10:47.783
Arthur knows anger sometimes
just gets the best of me.

10:47.785 --> 10:50.152
Aw, not at all.

10:50.154 --> 10:51.820
I think you're actually
quite a hoot.

10:54.091 --> 10:56.925
- Did I just giggle?
- And what's wrong with that?

10:56.927 --> 11:01.964
Come on, let yourself
have a good time.

11:01.966 --> 11:04.132
When I first stumbled upon
this little oasis,

11:04.134 --> 11:05.934
I wasn't so sure.

11:05.936 --> 11:08.103
But Mr. Warrens, ah...

11:08.105 --> 11:10.372
Ah, he's quite a convincer.

11:10.374 --> 11:13.075
And here we are,
five years later.

11:13.077 --> 11:14.876
You two are the American dream.

11:14.878 --> 11:19.615
So, Arthur, we don't quite
know how to say this,

11:19.617 --> 11:21.049
but I was talking to Warrens

11:21.051 --> 11:25.387
and we'd like to make you
Cronenburgh's new cobbler.

11:25.389 --> 11:28.090
Oh, wow. Uh...

11:28.092 --> 11:33.228
I'm flattered, but I don't know
how to make shoes.

11:33.230 --> 11:36.064
And aren't you the town cobbler?

11:36.066 --> 11:37.833
I'm retiring.

11:37.835 --> 11:39.868
And you'll learn in jiffy.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.703
'Cause here in Cronenburgh,

11:41.705 --> 11:45.240
you have all the time
in the world.

11:45.242 --> 11:47.409
Okay.

11:47.411 --> 11:50.045
I... I can't really say no
to the birthday boy, now can I?

11:51.682 --> 11:53.982
Oh, this isn't David's birthday.

11:53.984 --> 11:56.118
- No, no.
- Anniversary.

11:56.120 --> 12:00.756
No, Arthur. Tonight we're
celebrating my life.

12:00.758 --> 12:04.793
This is my wake.

12:04.795 --> 12:06.728
Oh, I'm so sorry, I...

12:06.730 --> 12:08.897
I had no idea.
No, don't be.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.932
I've lived a wonderful life

12:10.934 --> 12:14.770
beside this gorgeous,
gorgeous gal.

12:14.772 --> 12:16.805
But here in Cronenburgh,

12:16.807 --> 12:19.808
my father believes
in celebrating life

12:19.810 --> 12:23.445
by passing it on to the living.

12:23.447 --> 12:28.150
Passing all parts of our life
to other people.

12:28.152 --> 12:31.186
Like your clothes
and CDs and stuff.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.856
No, no, no.
Arthur, no, no.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.292
What we're trying to say is

12:37.294 --> 12:40.762
when I'm dead and gone,

12:40.764 --> 12:43.198
I want you to take my wife.

12:48.304 --> 12:53.141
Jeff Warrens, J-Dub.
Grace Warrens.

12:58.748 --> 13:00.749
What's gotten into me?

13:00.751 --> 13:03.719
He's not even my type, but...

13:03.721 --> 13:07.889
He's just so dreamy.

13:07.891 --> 13:10.726
I wonder how my makeup looks.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.013
<i>Please, no.</i>

13:26.015 --> 13:27.581
Please, stop.
- Aki!

13:27.583 --> 13:29.350
- Stop, no!
- Aki!

13:29.352 --> 13:31.618
- Please, stop!
- Aki! Aki!

13:31.620 --> 13:33.654
- No! No!
- Aki.

13:41.062 --> 13:43.430
You scared me.

13:43.432 --> 13:47.368
Were you having a nightmare?

13:47.370 --> 13:51.038
I wasn't asleep.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.541
I was remembering things.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.410
I hurt you and I love you.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.516
Heart knows I'm a human now.

14:02.518 --> 14:06.553
They're gonna punish me
and I deserve it.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.722
Don't talk like that.

14:08.724 --> 14:12.059
You're not that person anymore.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.761
And I'm not gonna
let them find you.

14:21.603 --> 14:25.105
They made me hurt you.

14:25.107 --> 14:28.809
So we should hurt them.

14:28.811 --> 14:32.646
I was on the inside. I know how to 
breach their security protocols.

14:32.648 --> 14:34.181
Too dangerous.

14:34.183 --> 14:36.483
Let's stick with the plan
and find Arthur.

14:36.485 --> 14:39.420
With him on the outside
and your intel from the inside,

14:39.422 --> 14:41.455
we'll know all
Heart's weak spots.

14:41.457 --> 14:45.659
Okay, but Arthur's halfway
across the country by now.

14:45.661 --> 14:49.263
If we wanna get to him,
we need a fast car.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.532
And I know where
to hitch a ride.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.843
- Am I doing it right?
- Well, the good news is

15:02.845 --> 15:04.478
you're now the town cobbler,

15:04.480 --> 15:06.814
so you can make yourself
a double pair of lefties

15:06.816 --> 15:08.816
for your two left feet!

15:13.756 --> 15:17.224
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey, twinkle toes,

15:17.226 --> 15:19.593
you gotta see this.
Hang on, let me finish.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.095
- No, Arthur, stop.
- Hey...

15:21.097 --> 15:23.630
- No, stop, stop, stop.
- What are you doing?

15:23.632 --> 15:26.500
Look at the reflection.
These people are freaks.

15:26.502 --> 15:28.535
- You're the only one freaking.
- Look, Arthur.

15:28.537 --> 15:29.837
- Get that away from me.
- Look!

15:29.839 --> 15:31.271
Look at that guy's face!

15:31.273 --> 15:33.173
That girl doesn't even
have a face!

15:34.844 --> 15:38.846
Beloved, charm is deceitful.

15:38.848 --> 15:40.514
And beauty is vanity.

15:40.516 --> 15:43.717
But the woman
who fears the lord,

15:43.719 --> 15:46.787
she shall be praised.

15:46.789 --> 15:49.123
Proverbs 30:31.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.758
- Amen.
- Fuck you, Billy Graham.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.129
Mirrors are forbidden

15:55.131 --> 15:57.231
because they are
a symbol of vanity.

15:57.233 --> 16:01.268
And ego is not welcome here
at our celebration.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.669
Whoa, hey!

16:02.671 --> 16:05.806
Come on, not here.

16:05.808 --> 16:08.142
Just come with me.

16:12.647 --> 16:15.249
<i>Play the music!
Let's party!</i>

16:15.251 --> 16:17.151
Not only do you sound insane,

16:17.153 --> 16:19.286
you're being disrespectful.

16:19.288 --> 16:21.355
We're at a man's wake.

16:21.357 --> 16:23.624
He's still alive!

16:23.626 --> 16:25.626
Arthur, come on, this place
is seriously fucked up.

16:25.628 --> 16:27.361
We need to go.
Why do you always

16:27.363 --> 16:30.164
have to go digging
for pain and suffering?

16:30.166 --> 16:32.332
Why can't you just
accept what you see?

16:32.334 --> 16:34.935
I've been trying to tell you,
these people are not normal.

16:34.937 --> 16:37.738
Well, I haven't seen one drop
of blood since I've been here,

16:37.740 --> 16:43.544
and I can't exactly say I have
the same track record with you.

16:43.546 --> 16:45.646
This is not the Arthur I know.

16:45.648 --> 16:47.781
Well, I know who I am.

16:47.783 --> 16:51.318
And, for once,
I'm at peace with myself.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.921
Do you seriously
believe this shit?

16:53.923 --> 16:56.590
What's so hard to believe?

16:56.592 --> 16:57.925
I'm the cobbler now.

16:57.927 --> 17:00.327
My brand new wife is beautiful.

17:00.329 --> 17:02.696
She is named Melanie
and the old cobbler

17:02.698 --> 17:07.701
gave her to me as a present
because he's killing himself.

17:07.703 --> 17:11.238
This is all perfectly normal.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.375
Denial is not the same thing
as peace, you dipshit.

17:15.377 --> 17:18.779
My fiancÃ©e would never
call me a dipshit.

17:18.781 --> 17:22.348
She's totally chill.

17:24.285 --> 17:26.954
Okay.

17:26.955 --> 17:29.756
Fuck you.

17:55.351 --> 17:58.385
Arthur, will you
help me with this?

18:05.294 --> 18:06.827
What is that?

18:06.829 --> 18:08.662
That's the Scar, son.

18:08.664 --> 18:10.330
The real scar.

18:10.332 --> 18:13.800
Not that barren desert
that covers the top.

18:19.742 --> 18:22.376
You sure he's really that sick?

18:22.378 --> 18:25.345
Seems like he's still so...

18:25.347 --> 18:28.015
Alive.
It's an honor,

18:28.017 --> 18:31.018
not a death sentence.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.021
He's terminal, and this is how
he's chosen to go.

18:34.023 --> 18:36.890
I understand.

18:36.892 --> 18:40.994
But don't you think he should
spend his last days at home?

18:40.996 --> 18:43.964
I know death
is upsetting, Arthur.

18:43.966 --> 18:45.432
Just take a deep breath.

19:17.065 --> 19:22.469
Family, this man is a hero.

19:22.471 --> 19:27.074
And we honor his spirit
by feeding it to the Scar.

19:27.076 --> 19:29.776
And his gift will feed our souls

19:29.778 --> 19:30.877
for another year.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.747
Amen!

19:50.966 --> 19:53.500
It's just so beautiful.

20:19.161 --> 20:20.994
Holy fuck.

20:26.535 --> 20:29.536
Snoopy, snoopy.

20:29.538 --> 20:31.071
- Oh.
- That's my special outfit

20:31.073 --> 20:32.939
for my wedding night.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.142
Shouldn't you be at
your husband's party?

20:35.144 --> 20:38.178
Husband? oh.
Oh, right, him.

20:38.180 --> 20:40.547
I... I thought you meant
the new one.

20:40.549 --> 20:42.983
Arthur's cute, isn't he?

20:42.985 --> 20:45.419
Gah.

20:45.421 --> 20:48.155
It's the withdrawals.

20:48.157 --> 20:51.792
Shouldn't have
covered your face.

20:51.794 --> 20:52.926
Ahh!

20:56.864 --> 21:00.000
All right.

21:00.002 --> 21:03.703
Company benefits...

21:03.705 --> 21:06.139
Terminated.

21:06.141 --> 21:09.476
401k drained back into
the company fund

21:09.478 --> 21:14.848
and, uh, what do you want
for your meal?

21:14.850 --> 21:18.652
Oh, well,
I wasn't expecting a meal.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.020
I suppose something gluten free.

21:20.022 --> 21:22.689
All this stress
has me breaking out.

21:22.691 --> 21:24.057
You sure?

21:24.059 --> 21:27.127
Most people want steak and ice
cream for their last meal.

21:29.230 --> 21:31.998
- Last what?
- Dolores wanted toast.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.067
She's so modest.

21:36.771 --> 21:39.506
I never told her I loved her.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.908
Sorry, a little scattered.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.177
Gary's off sick.
He's left me

21:44.179 --> 21:46.880
with all of these Blood drive
mileage reimbursements

21:46.882 --> 21:51.918
and he knows I can't do math.
- Ah.

21:51.116 --> 21:54.885
Tell me more about
these mileage reimbursements.

21:54.887 --> 21:57.354
Your job must be so fascinating.

21:57.356 --> 22:03.393
Oh, well, you see, we get readings
off the wireless odometers.

22:03.395 --> 22:05.128
So we can get the mileage
and then Heart

22:05.130 --> 22:07.264
can deduct wear and tear
in tax season.

22:07.266 --> 22:10.067
Ah, well you know,
there's a very, very easy way

22:10.069 --> 22:13.370
to calculate that.

22:13.372 --> 22:16.406
Release me and I'll show you.

22:16.408 --> 22:18.008
No can do, sir.

22:18.010 --> 22:20.243
Safety protocol.

22:20.245 --> 22:22.312
Ah. I understand.

22:22.314 --> 22:25.916
Shame. be so sad to see
a nice guy like yourself

22:25.918 --> 22:27.984
get castrated over
a clerical error,

22:27.986 --> 22:30.987
when I can so easily show you
on the wall map over there.

22:44.068 --> 22:49.272
Okay. let's take, say,
Arthur and Grace.

22:49.274 --> 22:51.074
Arthur and Grace.

22:51.076 --> 22:54.945
How many miles
since their last stop?

22:54.947 --> 22:56.246
370.

22:56.248 --> 23:00.317
370 miles.
All right.

23:00.319 --> 23:05.055
So if they've gone 370 miles
from here,

23:05.057 --> 23:07.257
that means the only town
with civilization

23:07.259 --> 23:12.996
within his radius is here.

23:12.998 --> 23:17.134
I'm lost.

23:22.107 --> 23:25.809
I'm not.

23:25.811 --> 23:27.811
So I was on my way
to my dress fitting,

23:27.813 --> 23:31.348
and I thought you might be
working up an appetite in here.

23:31.350 --> 23:32.783
Aww!

23:32.785 --> 23:34.985
You're a gem, Mel bell.
Thanks.

23:34.987 --> 23:39.489
Of course.
Wow, the place looks great.

23:39.491 --> 23:43.527
Yeah.
Feels like... Home.

23:43.529 --> 23:47.430
And, hey, not bad
for my first one, huh?

23:47.432 --> 23:49.833
I was just about to give her
a good polish.

23:49.835 --> 23:54.104
I must say, I'm impressed
how well you're settling in.

23:54.106 --> 23:57.107
You're handling it
with a lot of Grace.

23:57.109 --> 23:59.176
Grace.

23:59.178 --> 24:02.412
Grace.
That sounds so familiar.

24:02.414 --> 24:04.815
Do we know someone named Grace?
So, I'm looking forward

24:04.817 --> 24:08.051
to showing you the master suite
after the wedding.

24:08.053 --> 24:11.354
I'm counting the milliseconds.

24:20.432 --> 24:22.833
What... what's wrong, honey?

24:22.835 --> 24:26.469
Nothing. I'm just
a little ticklish, is all.

24:26.471 --> 24:27.838
Oh.

24:31.542 --> 24:34.077
I see you've finally
come 'round.

24:34.079 --> 24:36.847
Hard to resist
that Cronenburgh charm, hm?

24:36.849 --> 24:38.481
You wish.

24:38.483 --> 24:41.151
Reality sucks, doesn't it?

24:41.153 --> 24:44.054
You know, I used to be
just like you, Grace.

24:44.056 --> 24:48.124
Mad at the world.
Until I learned to stop

24:48.126 --> 24:50.227
and take a deep breath.
No, what you did

24:50.229 --> 24:53.263
is drug everyone and put them
under a fucked up spell.

24:53.265 --> 24:55.298
- I'm helping them.
- Right.

24:55.300 --> 24:59.436
Saving them from their pain.

24:59.438 --> 25:02.906
I can tell you feel pain, Grace.

25:02.908 --> 25:06.576
I can see it in your face.

25:06.578 --> 25:09.913
But I'm giving you
a chance at happiness

25:09.915 --> 25:12.582
tonight, at the wedding.

25:12.584 --> 25:15.252
And watch Arthur
marry that skeletor?

25:15.254 --> 25:17.087
Yeah.
No thanks.

25:17.089 --> 25:19.222
Where else are you
gonna go, Grace?

25:19.224 --> 25:21.091
Your world fell.

25:21.093 --> 25:23.493
Ours is still standing.

25:23.495 --> 25:25.462
Your world is a lie.

25:25.464 --> 25:29.232
Perception is a lie.

25:29.234 --> 25:33.536
Our happiness is real.

25:33.538 --> 25:37.307
You can share it with us.

25:37.309 --> 25:39.476
Don't fight it.

25:39.478 --> 25:43.914
I'd rather die
knowing who I really am...

25:43.916 --> 25:48.151
Fucked up flaws and all...

25:48.153 --> 25:52.956
Than to play house
with freaks like you.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.592
Very well.

25:55.594 --> 25:58.194
At sunset,

25:58.196 --> 26:00.497
you get your wish.

26:13.645 --> 26:15.278
We're running out of time.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.579
Heart security
doesn't patrol here

26:16.581 --> 26:18.381
like they do
at the main offices.

26:18.383 --> 26:20.183
We'll be fine.

26:20.185 --> 26:22.652
We just have to crack
this pass code.

26:22.654 --> 26:26.189
Try 123.
1234?

26:26.191 --> 26:27.991
I'm in.

26:27.993 --> 26:32.395
Jaguar for the shell
with the blood drive engine.

26:32.397 --> 26:34.264
What do you think about
blue rims?

26:34.266 --> 26:36.366
No, wait. Yellow.

26:36.368 --> 26:38.268
Blue.
Definitely blue.

26:38.270 --> 26:40.370
Too late.
We've gone for silver.

26:40.372 --> 26:42.238
Man.

26:56.655 --> 26:58.321
All we need is the gas.

27:09.667 --> 27:15.038
You put the steering wheel
on the wrong side.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.308
Ready to go?

27:18.310 --> 27:19.576
It's strange leaving here

27:19.578 --> 27:22.379
when I've never
lived anywhere else.

27:22.381 --> 27:25.415
I know you're scared.

27:25.417 --> 27:29.586
Besides, maybe you have seen
the world and don't remember it.

27:29.588 --> 27:31.287
Maybe Heart erased
all your memories

27:31.289 --> 27:34.724
and replaced them with new ones.

27:34.726 --> 27:38.061
After we find Arthur,

27:38.063 --> 27:41.731
I wanna make
a real memory with you.

27:41.733 --> 27:43.700
We're starting right now.

27:55.479 --> 27:58.481
Strawberry lemonade,
get your strawberry lemonade.

27:58.483 --> 28:03.820
Howdy, traveler. Lemonade?

28:03.822 --> 28:07.057
Hard pass on
the blood piss, child.

28:07.059 --> 28:10.393
Now, tell me where
your daddy lives.

29:13.158 --> 29:15.692
Wedding day jitters
are perfectly normal.

29:15.694 --> 29:18.695
They'll disappear,
as soon as you say "I do."

29:18.697 --> 29:20.897
Welcome to the family, son.

29:45.189 --> 29:46.556
Put me down!

29:46.558 --> 29:48.925
Where are you taking me? Stop.

29:48.927 --> 29:51.861
Wait a sec, I know you.

29:51.863 --> 29:55.165
You're Grace.
Arthur, snap out of it!

29:55.167 --> 29:56.499
I'm gonna kill you.

29:56.501 --> 29:58.501
You look so handsome.

29:58.503 --> 30:01.838
Thank you,
you're very beautiful.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.439
Snap out of it!

30:03.441 --> 30:05.408
You were always
so special to me.

30:05.410 --> 30:08.311
It means so much
that you'd come to the ceremony.

30:08.313 --> 30:10.580
It's the Scar. It's the Scar.
Don't believe any of it.

30:10.582 --> 30:12.582
I can't wait to die
for your happiness.

30:12.584 --> 30:14.350
Arthur, please help me!

30:14.352 --> 30:16.419
It's all a woman
could ever want.

30:16.421 --> 30:17.921
Arthur!

30:24.862 --> 30:27.197
Barbie!

30:27.199 --> 30:28.398
<i>Barbie!</i>

30:31.284 --> 30:33.252
Could we pull over?

30:33.254 --> 30:35.954
I feel... what do humans call it?

30:35.956 --> 30:38.257
Fucked up.
- You carsick?

30:38.259 --> 30:40.459
I'm sorry.

30:40.461 --> 30:43.796
Drink.
It might make you feel better.

30:50.838 --> 30:52.071
You okay?

30:53.441 --> 30:57.376
Ah! Goddamn!

31:02.049 --> 31:03.382
I'm fine.

31:03.384 --> 31:06.485
Keep driving.

31:08.989 --> 31:10.956
Shit.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.877
Aww, she's beautiful.

31:31.879 --> 31:33.979
There's no woman better, sir.

31:33.981 --> 31:36.949
<i>- Barbie!
- Please, call me dad.</i>

31:36.951 --> 31:39.518
<i>I can fucking hear you guys.</i>

31:39.520 --> 31:42.087
Goddammit, get me out of here!

31:47.093 --> 31:50.496
You look unbelievable.

32:00.808 --> 32:02.875
God, oh.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.144
Oh, um, that's just the nerves

32:05.146 --> 32:08.947
sometimes messes with
the sinuses.

32:08.949 --> 32:11.416
Dearly beloved family...

32:11.418 --> 32:14.019
We are gathered here

32:14.021 --> 32:18.056
to celebrate the love of these
two wonderful people.

32:25.866 --> 32:28.801
- I know you.
- Which is why I have to assume

32:28.803 --> 32:32.471
my invitation was lost
in the mail.

32:32.473 --> 32:34.473
We're in the middle
of a ceremony.

32:34.475 --> 32:36.475
Pardon moi, I'm only saving you

32:36.477 --> 32:39.378
from making the biggest mistake
of your life.

32:45.886 --> 32:48.821
You're a handsome,
virile young man.

32:48.823 --> 32:52.157
Don't ruin it
by settling down so soon.

32:54.395 --> 32:56.061
That and your bride's a mutant.

32:56.063 --> 33:00.399
Would you shut up?
You're ruining this.

33:00.401 --> 33:01.433
Kiss me!

33:01.435 --> 33:04.102
- Whoa! oh! Ahh!
- Arthur!

33:04.104 --> 33:06.038
Boy, is he ever gonna

33:06.040 --> 33:08.440
thank me for this one.

33:12.912 --> 33:14.980
This place is a shit hole.

33:14.982 --> 33:20.419
Everyone, everyone, uh,
the pain is only temporary.

33:20.421 --> 33:22.020
It's gonna be okay, family.

33:25.024 --> 33:26.425
Ahh!

33:26.427 --> 33:28.994
Ahh, ah.

33:28.996 --> 33:30.529
Ahh.

33:29.694 --> 33:31.394
Aren't you glad
I came to save you?

33:31.396 --> 33:34.764
Right.
My knight in shining Arthur.

33:34.766 --> 33:38.601
See if you can find a foothold
for me to step on.

33:38.603 --> 33:41.303
Ahh! it's too slippery.
I can't...

33:41.305 --> 33:44.173
easy, easy.
It's like quicksand.

33:44.175 --> 33:46.709
The more you struggle,
the harder it is.

33:46.711 --> 33:50.246
Oh, god.
Oh, my head is killing me.

33:50.248 --> 33:52.381
It's the withdrawals.

33:52.383 --> 33:53.816
Withdrawals from what?

33:53.818 --> 33:56.085
Is super sleuth still trying
to figure it out?

33:56.087 --> 33:59.188
Arthur, gas from the Scar
was causing hallucinations.

33:59.190 --> 34:00.322
Crazy, huh?

34:00.324 --> 34:01.624
But since I've plugged
the hole...

34:01.626 --> 34:03.325
Or should I say,
you plugged the hole...

34:03.327 --> 34:06.796
This town can finally see itself
for what it really is.

34:06.798 --> 34:07.830
Cleveland.

34:15.206 --> 34:17.172
We need to keep going.

34:17.175 --> 34:19.475
You're in pain.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.643
I'm not as human as I thought.

34:21.646 --> 34:24.246
Heart security protocols are
still active.

34:24.248 --> 34:25.681
Let's wait it out.
Maybe with...

34:25.683 --> 34:27.216
no.

34:27.217 --> 34:28.751
You need to go.

34:28.753 --> 34:30.753
I may have triggered
a tracking device.

34:30.755 --> 34:32.321
They could be on their way.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.090
I can't leave you here.

34:34.092 --> 34:37.393
You have to.
Go find Arthur.

34:37.395 --> 34:40.429
Make Heart pay
for what they've done.

34:40.431 --> 34:45.768
And when that's done,
I'll be waiting.

34:45.770 --> 34:49.105
And I'll be free.

34:49.107 --> 34:52.108
Now please taste my rainbow.

35:18.169 --> 35:19.735
Get us the hell out of here!

35:19.737 --> 35:21.804
Not until you think about
what you've done.

35:21.806 --> 35:23.439
Naughty, naughty!

35:23.441 --> 35:25.407
Cut the shit, slink!

35:25.409 --> 35:27.443
Tell us what your game is.

35:27.445 --> 35:29.311
Drive or die, Barbie doll.

35:29.313 --> 35:31.147
I'll save your
pathetic little lives

35:31.149 --> 35:35.751
if you agree to go on
one last adventure with me.

35:35.753 --> 35:37.286
Bullshit.

35:37.288 --> 35:38.888
Like you don't want us dead.

35:38.890 --> 35:40.723
Things have changed.

35:40.725 --> 35:43.292
In two minutes, that muck'll
fill your pretty, little mouth.

35:43.294 --> 35:45.161
Let's see how stubborn
you are then!

35:45.163 --> 35:48.164
Ah!

35:48.166 --> 35:50.166
Where the hell are you going?

35:54.771 --> 35:58.741
Grace, I need to
tell you something.

35:58.743 --> 36:03.479
Yeah, I... I already figured.

36:03.481 --> 36:06.849
You're gay.
What?

36:06.851 --> 36:09.451
No, I...

36:09.453 --> 36:10.953
I know you're pissed about me
leaving you

36:10.955 --> 36:12.855
at the Chinese restaurant,

36:12.857 --> 36:15.891
but I couldn't stand up for you

36:15.893 --> 36:18.928
when I couldn't stand
looking at myself.

36:26.270 --> 36:31.874
Look, Arthur, I never needed
you to stand up for me.

36:31.876 --> 36:34.343
I just needed you.

36:34.345 --> 36:39.348
I didn't want to
drag you into my shit.

36:39.350 --> 36:42.918
It's a little too late for that.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.954
Don't you get it, you idiot?

36:44.956 --> 36:47.923
Everything's changed
because of you.

36:47.925 --> 36:51.360
No more killing,
no more racing, I don't...

36:51.362 --> 36:53.395
I just want to move on.

36:53.397 --> 36:58.467
Okay? your incessantly
annoying morality speech

36:58.469 --> 37:00.803
finally got to me.

37:00.805 --> 37:04.640
Just hope you found whatever it
was you were looking for here.

37:04.642 --> 37:06.308
I did.

37:09.412 --> 37:12.615
Are you flirting with me?

37:12.617 --> 37:14.316
Maybe.

37:36.873 --> 37:41.010
Hey, Arthur?

37:41.012 --> 37:41.512
Yeah?

37:45.616 --> 37:49.451
Is that cement drying
or are you just happy to see me?

37:51.988 --> 37:54.757
You ruined paradise!

37:54.759 --> 37:56.959
A specialty of mine.
Julian slink,

37:56.961 --> 38:00.929
master of mayhem,
at your service.

38:00.931 --> 38:02.698
You get the hell out
of my church!

38:02.700 --> 38:03.866
Uh... ah!

38:03.868 --> 38:06.869
Touch the suit again

38:06.871 --> 38:10.039
and see what happens.
Ah!

38:10.041 --> 38:12.641
This man is the devil.

38:12.643 --> 38:14.877
He's been sent from hell

38:14.879 --> 38:18.314
to destroy everything
we've built in Cronenburgh.

38:18.316 --> 38:20.949
Please, reverend.

38:20.951 --> 38:23.585
All I did was turn off
the happy gas.

38:23.587 --> 38:26.588
I was passing through
your little Hamlet

38:26.590 --> 38:30.826
when I stumbled up on you.

38:30.828 --> 38:35.364
The beauty queens who've been
stunted by lies!

38:35.366 --> 38:37.032
No. that's not true.

38:39.836 --> 38:42.738
Brothers and sisters,

38:42.740 --> 38:45.074
the gas...

38:45.076 --> 38:47.643
The gas, the gas,
the gas, the gas,

38:47.645 --> 38:51.780
the gas shows you

38:51.782 --> 38:54.350
what you want to see!

38:54.352 --> 38:59.621
Love, acceptance, perfection.

38:59.623 --> 39:02.791
But I see the world
as it really is.

39:02.793 --> 39:06.362
Brutal and unforgiving.

39:06.364 --> 39:10.933
There's a reason your good
reverend here still looks human,

39:10.935 --> 39:14.603
while the rest of you all
look like Satan's butthole.

39:14.605 --> 39:18.907
There is an antidote and he's
been keeping it for himself.

39:18.909 --> 39:23.612
No! That is not true!
This man is a liar!

39:23.614 --> 39:26.081
You don't want anyone
to have the cure

39:26.083 --> 39:29.852
because it gives you the power...

39:29.854 --> 39:33.122
It gives you the power,
the power, the power over you!

39:33.124 --> 39:38.394
The power over you!
And the power over you!

39:38.396 --> 39:42.164
All this time
you've been wallowing here,

39:42.166 --> 39:44.133
there's a big world out there.

39:44.135 --> 39:46.101
Is it rough? Yes, it is.
But it's real.

39:46.103 --> 39:50.139
It's real, it is real,
it is real, it is real!

39:50.141 --> 39:53.008
But you've been tricked!
No.

39:53.010 --> 39:54.877
You've been tricked
and you're following

39:54.879 --> 39:59.948
this sad, lonely,
despicable man!

39:59.950 --> 40:05.187
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?

40:05.189 --> 40:07.456
Can I get an amen?
No, no!

40:07.458 --> 40:10.159
No! the devil!

40:17.066 --> 40:19.468
There.

40:19.470 --> 40:22.171
Now we can all be miserable.

40:22.173 --> 40:27.676
Sorry about that.
So you two ready to go yet?

40:27.678 --> 40:29.178
Oh, dear.

40:35.485 --> 40:38.454
Oh, you washed it.
How thoughtful.

40:38.456 --> 40:40.222
Well, you know me.

40:43.927 --> 40:45.961
How the hell do you
always do that?

40:45.963 --> 40:51.233
Ah, ah, ah.
More fun when she drives.

40:51.235 --> 40:54.770
You know, Arthur,
I'm feeling pretty good

40:54.772 --> 40:55.904
without these brain bombs.

40:55.906 --> 40:57.139
How about you?
Oh, me too.

40:57.141 --> 40:59.174
What do you say
we ditch this guy

40:59.176 --> 41:01.210
and get the hell out of here?
Yeah, let's cut class.

41:01.212 --> 41:03.045
You could do that.

41:03.047 --> 41:06.048
And I could chase you and fight
and blah, blah, blah.

41:06.050 --> 41:08.250
Or you could keep your promise

41:08.252 --> 41:12.054
and go on one last adventure.

41:12.056 --> 41:13.956
After that, good riddance.

41:13.958 --> 41:15.924
You two lovebirds can
flit off into the sunset

41:15.926 --> 41:17.693
for all I care.

41:17.695 --> 41:20.095
What I have planned
for Heart enterprises

41:20.097 --> 41:22.698
will have them begging
at my feet.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.066
I get a sweet overall
and you get to

41:24.068 --> 41:27.836
get to the bottom of
this bizarre obsession

41:27.838 --> 41:30.973
they have with you
and your sister.

41:30.975 --> 41:34.176
I'm not making a deal
with the devil.

41:34.178 --> 41:36.812
Arthur.

41:36.814 --> 41:39.281
We already did.

41:39.283 --> 41:40.749
What do you say?
One last detour.

41:40.751 --> 41:42.818
We can handle that.

41:42.820 --> 41:46.154
You may not get
the answers you want.

41:46.156 --> 41:50.726
Yeah, but I have to try.

41:50.728 --> 41:51.960
Yeah.

41:58.201 --> 42:00.235
It was nice
while it lasted, huh?

42:00.237 --> 42:02.771
Taste of the normal life.

42:02.773 --> 42:05.007
We'll get it back.

42:05.009 --> 42:07.943
Next time, it'll be for real.

42:07.945 --> 42:09.244
Road trip!

42:09.246 --> 42:12.014
And I brought
my world-famous mixtape.
