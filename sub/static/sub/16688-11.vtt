WEBVTT

00:12.160 --> 00:14.260
What an awesome trip
to the summer time planet.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.940
Yeah, I've been dying to get
one of these Uber Soakers!

00:18.040 --> 00:19.860
( Both laughing )

00:19.960 --> 00:22.140
What's next?
We're going to run
some errands!

00:22.240 --> 00:25.440
Both: Errands!

00:28.840 --> 00:30.580
Welcome to planet Lobius,
everyone!

00:30.680 --> 00:32.380
What are we here for
exactly?

00:32.480 --> 00:34.540
I need to pick up a roll of film
I had developed.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.900
Why'd you come here
to get it developed?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
They're the only planet
that still does it.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.260
Whoa!
( Laughs )

00:40.360 --> 00:42.540
Aah!
Whoo!

00:42.640 --> 00:45.020
Hey, you know how you just said
"whoo" really loud?

00:45.120 --> 00:47.060
Yeah?
Well, never say that
on this planet.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.740
These people are very sensitive
to sound.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.700
So, be respectful
and please keep it down.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.800
No problem.
Easy enough.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.420
Both: Whoa!

01:01.520 --> 01:02.660
( Wind chimes jingling )

01:02.760 --> 01:04.760
( Mumbling )
Kids these days.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.100
( Bag pops )
Do you mind?!

01:07.200 --> 01:08.420
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.100
( Tweeting )
Woof! Woof! Woof!

01:10.200 --> 01:12.220
Oh no, Rufus,
that is too much.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.320
( Whimpering )

01:15.680 --> 01:17.100
I'll be done in a jiffy!

01:17.200 --> 01:19.200
I'm gonna see what they got
for hair gel.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.600
Wonder if they've got
cinnamon toothpicks.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.380
Ha!

01:23.480 --> 01:25.480
Ugh! Rrr!

01:28.280 --> 01:29.500
( Chains jingle )
( Gasping )

01:29.600 --> 01:31.500
Man: Oh, no.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.580
( Crash )

01:32.680 --> 01:35.980
( Phones ringing )

01:36.080 --> 01:37.500
( Electricity crackling )

01:37.600 --> 01:39.100
( Alarm blaring )

01:39.200 --> 01:40.340
( Groaning )

01:40.440 --> 01:43.620
( Glass cracking, shatters )

01:43.720 --> 01:44.580
What's going on?!

01:44.680 --> 01:45.580
Uh...

01:45.680 --> 01:47.860
we should probably leave.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.060
You're under arrest!

01:49.160 --> 01:52.040
On what charge!
Making a ruckus.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.140
Typical. They would do
something like this.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.780
Hey, innocent
until proven guilty!

01:58.880 --> 02:00.880
Oh, you know
they did it!
Oh yeah.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.620
Who's the old lobe?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.020
That's the Auricle.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.460
The oldest, most respected ear
on Lobius.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.340
Shouldn't they call him
the Earicle?

02:09.440 --> 02:11.340
It really seems
like a missed opportunity.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.100
Order, order in the court.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.740
Prosecution will now give
its opening remarks.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.220
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.820
Ladyâears and gentleâears
of the jury.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.620
We are here to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

02:23.720 --> 02:27.460
that Mordecai and Rigby
intentionally caused a ruckus

02:27.560 --> 02:31.420
and should
be punished sevâearely.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.820
( Chatter, Laughter )
Thank you.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.820
Public defendâear,
how do you plead?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.180
Uh, "not guilty."

02:36.280 --> 02:37.300
All right.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.540
Prosecutâear,
call your first witness.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.020
Gladly, Your Honor.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.380
I call Mordecai to the stand.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.460
Place your hand on the Auricle
if you swear to tell the truth,

02:46.560 --> 02:48.560
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.660
I swear.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.700
Mordecai, would you be so kind
as to tell these folks

02:52.800 --> 02:54.460
what transpired earlier today?

02:54.560 --> 02:57.260
You know, when you
and your friend made that

02:57.360 --> 02:59.860
horrible noise downtown?

02:59.960 --> 03:00.940
We can explain.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.700
I'm 100% ready to listen.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.060
He really should have said,
"I'm all ears!"

03:05.160 --> 03:06.580
It's right there!

03:06.680 --> 03:09.500
So, Rigby and I just got
these cool new Uber Soakers.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.820
Rigby tried to squirt me,
but he missed, and ââ

03:11.920 --> 03:13.920
and it was all
just a big accident, okay?!

03:13.560 --> 03:15.580
Oh! An "accident?!"

03:15.680 --> 03:18.900
Why don't you tell that to poor
little Jesse down in the ICU!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.900
( Gasping )
Woman: Good gracious.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Jesse had already been hit
by a car,

03:23.480 --> 03:25.700
but that loud noise interrupted
his favorite show.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.780
Very tragic.
No more questions.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.900
You gotta help us, man.
We're dying out there!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.500
Don't worry.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.600
All I've gotta do is present
these records that prove

03:33.120 --> 03:34.940
you were nowhere near
that phone booth.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.660
Our case doesn't have anything
to do with a phone booth!

03:37.760 --> 03:40.180
Wait, is this room 17?
No, it's not!

03:40.280 --> 03:42.980
I now call Rigby
to the stand.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.380
So, what would you say happened,
Mr. Rigby?

03:46.480 --> 03:47.900
Like Mordecai said ââ

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Uber Soaker, accident,
loud noise, boom!

03:49.640 --> 03:51.180
( Gasping )
Watch your volume, son,

03:51.280 --> 03:52.620
or I'll hold you
in contempt!

03:52.720 --> 03:55.060
Oh, geez!
Come on, can't you do something?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.540
Uh, uh...

03:56.640 --> 03:58.640
I'd like to call for a recess,
Your Honor!

03:58.040 --> 03:59.340
Make it quick.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.300
What we need is uh...

04:02.400 --> 04:04.180
Oh!
Character witnesses!

04:04.280 --> 04:05.900
You know,
people who would testify

04:06.000 --> 04:08.140
that you would never
make a loud noise on purpose.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.240
Say that you're not
troublemakers,
that sort of thing.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.700
I <i>thinkour friends</i>
could do that.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.740
Yeah. If there's anybody we can
count on, it's our friends.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.060
So, Benson.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.780
You're Mordecai
and Rigby's boss.
Yes.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.220
No more questions,
Your Honor.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.700
Whâwhat was that?!

04:23.800 --> 04:25.300
I'm just getting 'em
warmed up!

04:25.400 --> 04:27.700
So, Mr. Benson.

04:27.800 --> 04:32.060
Mordecai and Rigby would never,
say, whoo,

04:32.160 --> 04:34.940
make a loud noise like today
on purpose?

04:35.040 --> 04:38.540
Mordecai and Rigby:
<i>Whoooooooa! USA! USA! USA!</i>

04:38.640 --> 04:40.660
No.
Hmm. I see.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.540
And what is your job?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.420
I'm a park manager.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.740
Ah, park manager.
Park manager.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.300
Done that all your life,
have you?

04:49.400 --> 04:50.540
Uh, no, sir.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.980
Mm, what was your job
before that?

04:54.080 --> 04:58.260
Well, I don't mean to brag, but
I was a professional drummer.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.100
( Gasping )

05:00.200 --> 05:02.780
We are supposed to take the word
of a drummer?!

05:02.880 --> 05:04.980
A man of
the forbidden instrument?

05:05.080 --> 05:08.300
He knows nothing
of peace and quiet,

05:08.400 --> 05:10.780
and therefore I move
to throw out his testimony!

05:10.880 --> 05:12.880
Let it be stricken
from the record!

05:15.280 --> 05:16.580
Eileen,
don't fail me now!

05:16.680 --> 05:19.140
Mrs. ââ
Ms. Roberts, uh...

05:19.240 --> 05:22.140
how do you know
the defendants, Rigby?
We're dating.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.940
Ah, really?
I knew it!

05:24.040 --> 05:26.460
This whole time I've been like
"are they" but ââ
Ahem!

05:26.560 --> 05:30.540
In your opinion, would Rigby
intentionally make a loud noise?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.900
Oh, no.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Rigby might make mistakes
from time to time

05:33.720 --> 05:35.180
but who doesn't?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.700
Like sometimes he talks
when my shows are on.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.580
But he always whispers.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.020
And it's usually just to ask
how my day was!

05:42.120 --> 05:44.860
All: Aww!
Oh, aren't they
just the cutest?

05:44.960 --> 05:48.580
Lâlet the record show
that this is adorable.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.580
No further questions.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.620
Boy, that Rigby
sounds like a heck of a guy.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.140
Would you say
he's a calm person?

05:57.240 --> 05:59.420
( Laughs ) Uh, yes.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.380
But how does he express himself
when he's not calm?

06:02.480 --> 06:03.980
When he's all riled up?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.980
Uh, well, he says, um...

06:07.080 --> 06:08.100
It's really funny.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.660
He says, "Stop talking."

06:09.760 --> 06:11.300
Hm, he says it just like that,
does he?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.420
I mean more in his voice.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.060
How would that voice sound,
Ms. Roberts, in <i>hisvoice?</i>

06:17.160 --> 06:20.860
It would...sound like...

06:20.960 --> 06:22.220
Go on, Ms. Roberts.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.220
I don't know.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.980
I think you do, Ms. Roberts.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.620
I...
We don't have all day.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.540
I...
How does he say it?!

06:28.640 --> 06:30.380
( Shrieks )
Stop talking!

06:30.480 --> 06:31.860
( Jury gasps )

06:31.960 --> 06:34.780
Hm, no more questions.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.220
Your Honor, I'd like to call

06:36.320 --> 06:39.020
a series of incriminating
witnesses to the stand.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.460
Who else
are they gonna call?

06:40.560 --> 06:41.460
Mordecai and Rigby?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.860
They got me caught in

06:42.960 --> 06:44.960
one of the loudest shoot outs
I've ever heard!

06:44.880 --> 06:46.740
They cut the moon
in twain!

06:46.840 --> 06:49.540
Never heard such a terrible
thing in all my life.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.300
You know what it sounds like to
hear yourself explode...

06:53.400 --> 06:54.460
twice?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.020
I've heard enough.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.020
We will now have the jury
delibâearate.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.700
I really feel like
that did not go over well.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.860
No way!

07:01.960 --> 07:03.660
That Eileen and Rigby thing
killed!

07:03.760 --> 07:05.340
There's no way they'll find
you...

07:05.440 --> 07:06.460
Guilty!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
We find the defendants
guilty!

07:07.960 --> 07:10.420
Okay. Okay, Okay.
Don't worry.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.520
He'll probably just give you
a slap on the wrist.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.140
Judge may look tough,

07:14.240 --> 07:16.240
but it's been decades since
anyone's been sentenced to...

07:16.120 --> 07:18.740
Life in prison!

07:18.840 --> 07:23.020
The penalty for your crimes
is life in prison!

07:23.120 --> 07:25.120
What happened
to a slap on the wrist!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.620
We don't have wrists!

07:26.720 --> 07:27.660
We're all ears!

07:27.760 --> 07:29.500
There it is!
Uh...

07:29.600 --> 07:32.100
it says here we're allowed
a leniency thingy!

07:32.200 --> 07:34.220
Y'know, with the Auricle!

07:34.320 --> 07:36.020
( Gasping )
Man: Ooh. The Auricle.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.580
Seriously?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.120
We're gonna go all the way out
to the Auricle's house for this?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.340
It's the law.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.460
I feel terrible!
Ack! My cartilage is achy.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.660
And someone keeps messing
with the thermostat.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.580
Why don't you take
your medicine?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.220
Oh, I hate that show!

07:52.320 --> 07:54.500
No, I said
"take your medicine!"

07:54.600 --> 07:56.220
I don't like that show
either!

07:56.320 --> 07:57.460
( Sighs )
( Knocking )

07:57.560 --> 07:59.940
Oh. I think some people
are here for a pardon.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.420
Won't that be some fun?

08:01.520 --> 08:04.940
No, that show's not on tonight.
We'll have to record it.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.180
Okay, guys.
Approach the Auricle.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.780
Sir, my name's Mordecai,
and this is my friend, Rigby.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
And we were just sentenced
to life in prison

08:12.640 --> 08:14.640
for making
a really loud noise.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.420
We were just here
for a quick stop!

08:15.520 --> 08:17.520
And it was
all an accident!

08:16.760 --> 08:18.760
We didn't mean to cause
any trouble!

08:18.280 --> 08:20.280
And, well, can you forgive us,
please?

08:19.560 --> 08:23.100
I've heard a lot of crazy things
in my time,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.860
but I did not hear
a lick of that.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.460
You are gonna have to
speak up.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.220
Um, so Mordecai and I ââ

08:29.320 --> 08:30.740
Closer! I won't bite ya!

08:30.840 --> 08:32.620
Mordecai and I ââ

08:32.720 --> 08:33.900
Ah! Whoa!
( Gong! )

08:34.000 --> 08:34.940
( Gasping )

08:35.040 --> 08:37.100
I'm sorry.
The audacity!

08:37.200 --> 08:38.580
First you barge in here

08:38.680 --> 08:40.700
screaming
at the top of your lungs

08:40.800 --> 08:42.800
and then you assault me?!

08:41.920 --> 08:43.620
It was an accident!
Please!

08:43.720 --> 08:45.140
No pardon!

08:45.240 --> 08:47.220
I find these two
beyond a reasonable doubt

08:47.320 --> 08:49.540
guilty as sin
for assaulting the Auricle!

08:49.640 --> 08:51.820
Take them away!
No!

08:51.920 --> 08:54.140
Rigby!
Eileen! The Uber Soakers!

08:54.240 --> 08:55.580
( Grunts )

08:55.680 --> 08:57.680
Ugh.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.620
Whoa!

09:04.520 --> 09:05.380
Stay back!

09:05.480 --> 09:06.700
Easy, man!

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
Whâwhat is that,
some kind of dangerous weapon?

09:08.640 --> 09:11.180
It is absolutely
a dangerous weapon!

09:11.280 --> 09:13.280
This has all been
one crazy misunderstanding!

09:13.360 --> 09:15.360
Now you're gonna let us go
before ââ Aah!

09:18.280 --> 09:22.660
( Slow motion ) Aah!

09:22.760 --> 09:23.620
( Gasps )

09:23.720 --> 09:25.820
Auricle!
( Gasps )

09:25.920 --> 09:27.540
Somebody get him
an earologist!

09:27.640 --> 09:31.100
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I don't need an earologist.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.540
( Gasps )
You heard me?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.500
Yeah, yeah! I heard ya!

09:34.600 --> 09:37.500
But your horn
is all the way over there.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.820
( Gasping )
He can hear.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.620
By lobe!

09:41.720 --> 09:45.540
I haven't heard this well
since before my Woodstock days.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.640
I used to stock wood
at my father's lumber mill.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.660
But how?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.420
Well, I guess, uh...

09:50.520 --> 09:52.860
Uber Soaker.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.260
This man right here must've
flushed out my gutty works

09:56.360 --> 09:58.020
when he shot me
with his water pistol.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.180
Now I'm the Auricle
and I knew that.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.860
Boys,
I'm gonna let you go.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.300
Both: Yeah!

10:03.400 --> 10:05.660
However, I'm gonna need to take
your water pistol.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.820
( Laughs )

10:06.920 --> 10:08.900
These works
get gutty real quick.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.500
No way!
Leave it!

10:10.600 --> 10:11.780
But ââ
All: Leave it!

10:11.880 --> 10:13.900
Fine.
Here, take it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.240
( Laughs )
Well, thank you kindly, child.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.500
( Rockets blast )

10:22.600 --> 10:24.180
Well, that
was pretty crazy!

10:24.280 --> 10:26.280
Glad Recap got that film
developed though.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.340
Hope it was worth it!

10:28.440 --> 10:31.460
Recap:
( Chuckles nervously )

10:31.560 --> 10:33.660
Yep!
Totally worth it!

10:47.880 --> 10:50.760
( Laughing )
