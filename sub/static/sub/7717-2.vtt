WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.602
The building's custodian is
on vacation for the month,

00:06.704 --> 00:08.886
and Dwight is too chip to
hire a replacement.

00:08.998 --> 00:10.918
So, instead, we're living in filth,

00:11.037 --> 00:12.430
but, not for long...

00:12.532 --> 00:16.042
because I have created
the chore wheel.

00:16.332 --> 00:19.170
Yeah.
Can I spin first?

00:19.272 --> 00:21.372
Well, it doesn't spin.
We'll just move the wheel

00:21.374 --> 00:24.575
one notch each morning,
and you see what chore

00:24.577 --> 00:25.609
you get that day.

00:25.611 --> 00:27.111
A wheel is supposed to spin.

00:27.113 --> 00:29.180
Yeah, you know,
like "guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh

00:29.182 --> 00:31.315
- guh-guh-guh-guh-h-guh..."
- No, I'm familiar

00:31.317 --> 00:32.650
with spinning.
It's just that wouldn't work

00:32.652 --> 00:34.552
with the chore wheel
because people might get

00:34.554 --> 00:37.121
- the same chore...
- Yuck. Boring.

00:37.123 --> 00:38.823
All she talks about is chores.

00:38.825 --> 00:42.293
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.

00:42.295 --> 00:44.295
Spinning would be more fun.

00:46.898 --> 00:49.266
Okay.

00:49.268 --> 00:51.802
Okay, that's what I'm talkin' about.

00:51.804 --> 00:52.970
- Woo!
- Wow!

00:52.972 --> 00:56.574
- Spinning!
- Big money, big money.

00:56.576 --> 00:58.409
Yeah!

00:58.411 --> 00:59.710
Mug duty?

00:59.712 --> 01:02.780
Yes, you clean all the mugs
in the sink.

01:02.782 --> 01:04.315
This sucks.

01:04.316 --> 01:05.783
Yeah, seriously, it's like everything

01:05.785 --> 01:07.184
on there's work.

01:07.186 --> 01:09.620
I don't think you guys
understand why we're doing this.

01:09.622 --> 01:11.689
- It's...
- Yeah, and I don't think

01:11.691 --> 01:13.457
that you understand wheels.

01:14.961 --> 01:17.161
I've been through several rounds
of development

01:17.163 --> 01:19.196
with the team,
and here's where we stand

01:19.198 --> 01:22.333
with the chore wheel.

01:22.335 --> 01:24.001
We've got prizes!

01:24.003 --> 01:27.304
Ten bucks, candy bar,
manager for an hour.

01:27.306 --> 01:30.941
But there are also penalties,
like no internet,

01:30.943 --> 01:32.276
Stanley gets your lunch.

01:32.278 --> 01:34.311
The one thing
that is not on the chore wheel

01:34.313 --> 01:36.447
is chores, but they were right.

01:36.449 --> 01:38.115
It's more fun this way.

01:41.287 --> 01:43.087
Whoo!

01:43.089 --> 01:45.656
- Tiny wheel!
- Tiny wheel!

01:45.658 --> 01:47.925
- Tiny wheel! Tiny wheel!
- There it is!

01:47.927 --> 01:51.095
The tiny wheel
actually does have chores.

01:51.097 --> 01:52.863
It's so cute, no one seems to mind.

01:52.865 --> 01:53.964
- Toilets!
- Aww.

01:57.336 --> 01:59.069
- Tiny wheel.
- Lucky!

01:59.071 --> 02:00.537
- Good choice.
- Woo!

Pam, we gotta go!

02:23.729 --> 02:28.265
Cece, go back inside.
Grandma's got breakfast, okay?

02:28.267 --> 02:31.568
We are going to Roy's wedding.

02:31.570 --> 02:32.903
Yep, Roy.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.805
I think the only weird thing
about going

02:34.807 --> 02:36.206
to your wife's
ex-fiancee's wedding

02:36.208 --> 02:38.375
on a weekday at 8 AM

02:38.377 --> 02:39.677
is that it's
your wife's ex-fiancee.

02:39.679 --> 02:42.646
Thanks, mom!

02:42.648 --> 02:44.548
- Banana?
- Yeah.

02:44.550 --> 02:45.883
I'm afraid
he's only gonna have hot dogs.

02:45.885 --> 02:47.151
Come on, not even Roy

02:47.153 --> 02:48.719
will have hot dogs at his wedding.

02:48.721 --> 02:50.888
I planned a wedding with him.
He wanted hot dogs.

02:53.091 --> 02:56.660
Just... it's so weird.

02:56.662 --> 02:58.696
Pete, you've got mail.

02:58.698 --> 03:00.030
Really?
I got somethin'?

03:00.032 --> 03:01.598
Well, it's addressed
to customer service,

03:01.600 --> 03:02.866
so it's your mail.

03:02.868 --> 03:04.535
Well, you know,
I'm also customer service.

03:04.537 --> 03:05.769
Yeah, I'm alternating.

03:05.771 --> 03:07.037
Yay.

03:07.039 --> 03:08.539
Another person yellin' at me.

03:08.541 --> 03:10.407
Well, it could be a nice letter.

03:10.409 --> 03:12.276
I write nice letters
to companies all the time.

03:12.278 --> 03:14.178
That's really nice.

03:14.180 --> 03:16.880
Wow, <i>Newsweek,</i> huh?

03:16.882 --> 03:20.317
This election thing is crazy, right?

03:20.319 --> 03:21.986
It's open.

03:21.988 --> 03:23.620
Yeah.
I accidentally read it.

03:23.622 --> 03:26.490
It's not a nice letter.

03:26.492 --> 03:31.095
Okay.

03:31.097 --> 03:32.696
Get excited.

03:32.698 --> 03:35.632
The special projects fairy
has arrived.

03:35.634 --> 03:38.068
I know you don't really exist.

03:38.070 --> 03:40.771
Today, I launch
my big charity initiative,

03:40.773 --> 03:42.639
"Operation Give Back."

03:42.641 --> 03:45.743
Andy has shot down all of
my special projects thus far,

03:45.745 --> 03:48.445
but this one is about charity

03:48.447 --> 03:51.382
so I'd like to see him
piss on that one.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.053
Darryl!

03:56.055 --> 03:57.621
Ho-o-o! What's happenin'?

03:57.623 --> 03:58.889
Congratulations, baby.
Yeah.

03:58.891 --> 04:00.891
Thank you.

04:03.595 --> 04:05.896
- Is this his house?
- Think so.

04:05.898 --> 04:07.798
Mimosa?

04:07.800 --> 04:09.767
- I'm okay.
- Thank you.

04:09.769 --> 04:13.570
Would you like me to take your peel?

04:13.572 --> 04:15.572
Yes, thank you.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.480
Okay.

04:26.452 --> 04:27.751
Who's that?

04:27.753 --> 04:30.854
- My ex-fiancee.
- Ha-ha.

04:30.856 --> 04:33.924
I started a new business
with my college friend,

04:33.926 --> 04:35.492
but Pam doesn't know.

04:35.494 --> 04:38.429
Um, actually I...
I did tell Pam,

04:38.431 --> 04:41.398
and we decided no,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.500
but then I decided "yes, anyway,"

04:43.502 --> 04:46.904
so I'm thinking there's another
conversation coming,

04:46.906 --> 04:48.872
and it's hard to know
when that will be.

04:48.874 --> 04:52.810
With "Operation Give Back,"
you pick the charities

04:52.812 --> 04:53.944
Dunder Mifflin supports.

04:53.946 --> 04:56.947
Aw, boy.
What's happening?

04:56.949 --> 04:59.016
There's $4,000 to give away,

04:59.018 --> 05:01.018
so who has filled out their forms?

05:01.020 --> 05:04.088
- Stanley?
- American Diabetes Association.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.890
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.

05:06.892 --> 05:09.893
I'm sorry, is the assignment
to pick a selfish charity?

05:09.895 --> 05:12.529
I, uh, I would love to give...

05:12.531 --> 05:14.031
Heifers International.

05:14.033 --> 05:16.767
Listen to this.
They give a poor person

05:16.769 --> 05:18.535
like a goat or something.

05:18.537 --> 05:20.104
It's a great prank.

05:20.106 --> 05:21.905
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter

05:21.907 --> 05:23.040
and Help Build Gnomes.

05:23.042 --> 05:24.475
Dwight, what about you?

05:24.477 --> 05:25.976
I will not be participating,

05:25.978 --> 05:28.378
as there is no evidence
that charity works.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.447
Correction...
I give to a foundation

05:30.449 --> 05:31.849
that teaches homeless children

05:31.851 --> 05:34.785
nautical flag signaling...
Changes Lives.

05:34.787 --> 05:37.754
- Thank you, Andy.
- I'm not doing it for you.

05:37.756 --> 05:38.822
I'm doing it for the preservation

05:38.824 --> 05:40.424
of nautical flag signaling.

05:40.426 --> 05:42.593
Dwight, you will be participating.

05:42.595 --> 05:44.895
- No, thank you.
- Participation is mandatory,

05:44.897 --> 05:48.665
Dwight, but you can choose
whatever cause you like.

05:48.667 --> 05:52.402
Fine, I choose
the Global Relief Foundation...

05:52.404 --> 05:54.404
- Great, thank you...
- ...which was recently discovered

05:54.406 --> 05:56.673
to be a front for the Taliban!

05:56.675 --> 05:58.609
- For goodness' sake.
- Yeah.

05:58.611 --> 06:02.012
The Taliban
in Af-a-ghanistan.

06:02.014 --> 06:05.949
The Taliban is the worst.

06:05.951 --> 06:07.184
Great heroin, though.

06:07.186 --> 06:10.254
Dwight, I cannot have
the Taliban on the roster

06:10.256 --> 06:11.588
of "Operation Give Back."

06:11.590 --> 06:12.889
Well, then, it looks
like there won't be

06:12.891 --> 06:15.192
any "Operation Give Back."

06:15.194 --> 06:17.060
The nanny state is over,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:17.062 --> 06:20.464
You're welcome.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.568
There he is.

06:24.570 --> 06:26.370
Is it almost time
to cut the pancake, or what?

06:26.372 --> 06:28.672
Aw, yeah.
We appreciate everyone

06:28.674 --> 06:30.407
coming so early.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.909
Everyone's just been so nice.

06:31.911 --> 06:33.243
Thanks for inviting us, by the way.

06:33.245 --> 06:35.045
- That was... that was a surprise.
- Are you kidding me?

06:35.047 --> 06:36.380
Come on, if it wasn't for you,

06:36.382 --> 06:38.048
I never would've met Laura.

06:38.050 --> 06:40.284
But seriously, could've dodged
a bullet on that one.

06:40.286 --> 06:41.418
- Just kidding.
- You're welcome.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.086
Thanks.

06:44.356 --> 06:47.057
By the way, man,
this place is beautiful.

06:47.059 --> 06:49.126
I started a gravel company.
I mean, who knew

06:49.128 --> 06:50.194
it would take off?

06:50.196 --> 06:51.962
- Gravel company.
- Yeah.

06:51.964 --> 06:53.196
- What about you?
- What are you doing?

06:53.198 --> 06:55.999
Not gravel, obviously.

06:56.001 --> 06:57.234
Nah, things are good.
Things are good.

06:57.236 --> 06:58.635
Got some stuff in the works, so...

06:58.637 --> 07:00.404
- Cool.
- Yeah, you never know.

07:00.406 --> 07:03.840
Hey, bro, stop wasting time
with this haircut.

07:03.842 --> 07:06.343
He's got a $50,000 sports car.

07:06.345 --> 07:07.945
- Cheers.
- Okay, Kenny.

07:07.947 --> 07:10.214
Duncan, listen,
I would love to help you out,

07:10.216 --> 07:11.448
but where am I gonna find somebody

07:11.450 --> 07:13.984
that's pretty, smart
and well-informed, huh?

07:13.986 --> 07:15.552
Hold on... hold on!

07:15.554 --> 07:21.525
Erin, do you know anybody
that might...

07:21.527 --> 07:23.927
My gosh.

07:23.929 --> 07:25.629
You love the news, right?

07:25.631 --> 07:27.030
Well, it depends.

07:27.032 --> 07:30.167
I mean, sometimes I find out
things that are really sad.

07:30.169 --> 07:31.335
Well, I got a buddy

07:31.337 --> 07:33.203
that's a big time
local news producer,

07:33.205 --> 07:36.106
and I can't tell you his name,
but it'd blow your mind.

07:36.108 --> 07:37.808
Is it Duncan?

07:37.810 --> 07:39.109
He's looking
for on-air talent,

07:39.111 --> 07:41.245
and he'd kill me
if I didn't get you on tape.

07:41.247 --> 07:42.779
You mean put me on the news?

07:42.781 --> 07:45.215
You'll just come over,
put on a little lipstick,

07:45.217 --> 07:46.883
loosen up with a glass of red wine,

07:46.885 --> 07:49.219
and then we'll just run
through a few stories.

07:49.221 --> 07:50.587
You know, a couple different ways

07:50.589 --> 07:52.789
with a couple different outfits.
It'd be really tasteful,

07:52.791 --> 07:55.092
and it'd really help me out
with Duncan...

07:55.094 --> 07:57.494
with my friend.

07:57.496 --> 07:59.029
What'd you say?

07:59.031 --> 08:01.265
No, maybe, okay?
Let me think about it.

08:01.267 --> 08:02.699
Okay.

08:02.701 --> 08:04.735
- Woo.
- Think it over.

08:07.705 --> 08:09.072
No, Clark's not my friend.

08:09.074 --> 08:11.742
He is the douche that sits
next to me at the office.

08:11.744 --> 08:14.011
My friends are Scott, Glenn and Rob,

08:14.013 --> 08:15.812
but you don't know them.

08:15.814 --> 08:17.948
I never really thought much
about being more

08:17.950 --> 08:20.217
than a receptionist, but why?

08:20.219 --> 08:22.452
Because I happened
to answer a "help wanted" ad

08:22.454 --> 08:23.587
to be a receptionist?

08:23.589 --> 08:27.124
I mean, what if the ad
had been for a CEO

08:27.126 --> 08:28.759
or for a brain surgeon?

08:28.761 --> 08:31.261
So, uh, it was a year ago today

08:31.263 --> 08:33.363
that I met Laura.

08:33.365 --> 08:35.131
I thought she was my waitress,

08:35.134 --> 08:37.134
and, uh,
took her three weeks

08:37.135 --> 08:39.169
to tell me that she actually
owned the place.

08:39.171 --> 08:40.636
You are full of surprises.

08:40.639 --> 08:43.774
You are my beautiful mystery girl,

08:43.775 --> 08:46.977
and today, I have a surprise for you.

08:48.947 --> 08:50.814
He plays piano?

08:50.816 --> 08:52.049
No.

08:52.051 --> 08:53.717
Roy? No.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.086
You know how I said
I was taking boxing lessons?

08:56.088 --> 08:57.988
Actually, I was doing this,

08:57.990 --> 09:00.791
um, so, I hope that you like it.

09:02.861 --> 09:05.162
You got this, Roy.

09:08.767 --> 09:14.371
♪ She's got a wa-a-ay
about her ♪

09:14.373 --> 09:17.040
♪ don't know what it is ♪

09:17.042 --> 09:21.645

09:21.647 --> 09:22.913
♪ she's got a way... ♪

09:25.350 --> 09:27.351
We still surprise each other.

09:27.353 --> 09:30.487
Definitely.

09:30.489 --> 09:33.156
You know, I never did it,
but for your 30th birthday,

09:33.158 --> 09:34.991
I really wanted to surprise you.

09:34.993 --> 09:36.960
Courtside seats.
Sixers.

09:36.962 --> 09:39.663
Yes, but what I didn't tell you

09:39.665 --> 09:41.298
is that I actually bought
the tickets.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.699
We only didn't go because it was...

09:42.701 --> 09:43.633
It was an away game.

09:43.635 --> 09:45.168
In Phoenix.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.770
They should really tell you
that more specifically.

09:46.772 --> 09:48.472
I mean, every game is an away game

09:48.474 --> 09:50.707
for one of the teams.

09:53.311 --> 09:55.145
Do we know everything
about each other?

09:55.147 --> 09:57.948
No.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.516
Tell me one thing
about you I don't know.

10:01.453 --> 10:05.188
Um, okay.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.526
There's one.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.893
Did I ever tell you about the time

10:11.895 --> 10:14.295
that my brothers videotaped
the lottery announcement

10:14.297 --> 10:16.364
and bought the winning numbers
the next day,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.499
and then, played the tape for me
the next week...

10:18.501 --> 10:19.834
And you thought
you guys were millionaires.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.202
You heard that one.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.204
Yes, but there's... Wait.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.073
There's a funny ending to that story.

10:25.075 --> 10:26.741
I can't remember.

10:26.743 --> 10:27.876
That I thought we were millionaires.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.110
That you thought
you were millionaires.

10:29.112 --> 10:30.111
- Yep.
- That's funny.

10:30.113 --> 10:31.679
- Shoot, I knew that one!
- That's all right.

10:31.681 --> 10:34.716
The senator and I still have mystery.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.917
I'm always waiting to see

10:35.919 --> 10:37.485
what he's gonna surprise me
with next.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.162
You all right?

10:50.566 --> 10:52.066
You support the Taliban abroad,

10:52.068 --> 10:56.504
so I assume you're willing
to live by their rules here.

10:56.506 --> 10:58.406
Anything else would be inconsistent.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.108
Will you join me then in a pledge

11:00.110 --> 11:03.845
to live by Taliban law
in this office?

11:07.082 --> 11:10.418
Absolutely, I will.

11:15.157 --> 11:17.292
I feared Nelly
had some sort of a plan,

11:17.294 --> 11:19.394
but she used a ridiculous font.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.530
You don't have a plan!

11:22.532 --> 11:24.766
When you use a ridiculous font,

11:24.768 --> 11:26.768
no one thinks you have a plan.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.872
Looking for this?

11:30.874 --> 11:33.875
What the...

11:33.877 --> 11:35.910
This is a lovely pen,

11:35.912 --> 11:39.314
and it's mine now,
because I stole it.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.883
- Gimme that.
- Didn't you sign a contract

11:41.885 --> 11:43.151
to live under Taliban law?

11:43.153 --> 11:45.086
And now, there's been a theft.

11:45.088 --> 11:47.188
That means you're not serious,

11:47.190 --> 11:50.858
or someone's getting
their hand cut off.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.794
- You're insane.
- I know,

11:52.796 --> 11:54.495
so it's better
that you pick another charity.

11:54.497 --> 11:57.265
And let your precious
"Operation Power Grab"

11:57.267 --> 11:58.566
proceed unchecked?

11:58.568 --> 11:59.634
No, thank you.

11:59.636 --> 12:04.105
In that case, you...

12:04.107 --> 12:07.942
will have to chop off my hand.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.915
This cleaver
appears to need sharpening.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.084
I suggest you spend
some quality time together,

12:16.086 --> 12:18.720
just you and your hand,
tie a shoe, toss a salad.

12:18.722 --> 12:20.555
Do any of the two-hand
activities

12:20.557 --> 12:21.789
that you'll miss the most.

12:21.791 --> 12:25.059
I tell you what.
I need to make three calls.

12:25.061 --> 12:28.529
And then after that,
you can become a person

12:28.531 --> 12:30.965
who chops off people's hands.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.601
Sounds like a plan.

12:33.603 --> 12:36.070
Clark wants to film you
in different outfits

12:36.072 --> 12:38.439
- inside his apartment?
- Yeah.

12:38.441 --> 12:43.344
Clark, you and I
need to have a little chat.

12:43.346 --> 12:49.083
What clothes does Erin need
for this news audition?

12:49.085 --> 12:52.320
A couple
of button-downs,

12:52.322 --> 12:55.556
a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt,

12:55.558 --> 12:58.026
stilettos, maybe a...
no, no, not maybe,

12:58.028 --> 12:59.927
definitely open-toed.

12:59.929 --> 13:02.463
Something low-cut,
because the camera

13:02.465 --> 13:03.664
makes everything
seem higher-cut.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.700
- Really?
- Yeah, industry secret.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.735
You're gonna want
some of those pantyhose

13:07.737 --> 13:08.736
with the seam up the back.

13:08.738 --> 13:10.405
Seems unnecessary for an audition.

13:10.407 --> 13:11.973
And then, you know, maybe just a robe

13:11.975 --> 13:14.242
to wear in between takes,
but I probably got one

13:14.244 --> 13:15.676
that she could borrow
at my place, so...

13:15.678 --> 13:17.045
Thank God someone here knows

13:17.047 --> 13:18.646
what they're talkin' about.

13:18.648 --> 13:19.981
I want you to take this credit card.

13:19.983 --> 13:23.284
Take Erin to the mall,
and get that stuff.

13:23.286 --> 13:24.819
I absolutely will do that.

13:24.821 --> 13:26.654
Awesome.

13:26.656 --> 13:28.823
Plop.

13:30.393 --> 13:34.328
Guess I'll just head over
to the mall then,

13:34.330 --> 13:37.832
buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.500
That Clark, huh?

13:41.871 --> 13:43.671
Next question for our oldyweds.

13:43.673 --> 13:46.040
What is the craziest place
you ever made whoopee?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.208
Language.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.676
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?

13:48.678 --> 13:52.880
- This is good, okay.
- Pam's first celebrity crush.

13:52.882 --> 13:54.215
John Stamos.

13:54.217 --> 13:55.583
- Ready?
- -huh.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.885
- John Stamos.
- Yes!

13:57.887 --> 14:00.121
John Stamos was temporary.
I quickly moved on to Johnny...

14:00.123 --> 14:02.423
Johnny Depp.

14:06.829 --> 14:09.464
Um, I was having
a separate conversation

14:09.466 --> 14:12.433
with Kevin?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.402
Johnny Depp.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.437
Totally. George Clooney.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.972
Mm-hmm.

14:17.974 --> 14:19.207
Okay, I'll have one.
I have one.

14:20.543 --> 14:23.277
Where is the craziest place
you ever made whoopee?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.413
Kevin, stop it with that question.

14:25.415 --> 14:27.682
Right?

14:27.684 --> 14:30.051
And did you show them
the market... yeah.

14:30.053 --> 14:33.187
And what'd they say?

14:33.189 --> 14:35.089
That's awesome.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.325
That... aw, my God.
Wow.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.160
It's not even real yet,

14:39.162 --> 14:43.131
and I'm not gonna tell her
until it's real.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.166
I think maybe
they're actually is something

14:45.168 --> 14:47.502
I don't know about Jim.

14:53.010 --> 14:54.777
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting

14:54.779 --> 14:58.014
in the conference room
to discuss Erin's confidence.

14:58.016 --> 14:59.782
Her body.
We're gonna talk about her body.

14:59.784 --> 15:00.884
Good. Great job.

15:00.886 --> 15:02.552
Andy made me his consigliere,

15:02.554 --> 15:04.454
which means
assistant regional manager.

15:04.456 --> 15:06.055
I guess he thought I'd be
into <i>The Godfather</i>

15:06.057 --> 15:09.225
because I'm black.

15:09.227 --> 15:10.994
Wrong!

15:10.996 --> 15:14.264
I'm into <i>The Godfather</i>
<i>'cause I'm a cinephile.</i>

15:14.266 --> 15:15.899
I like <i>Scarface 'cause I'm black.</i>

15:15.901 --> 15:19.636
Erin has an audition
to be a newscaster.

15:19.638 --> 15:21.137
- Wow!
- Woo!

15:21.139 --> 15:23.773
- -huh.
- Congratulations!

15:23.775 --> 15:26.743
And I want her
to feel very comfortable

15:26.745 --> 15:28.444
in her very sexy skin,

15:28.446 --> 15:30.680
so everybody say
something that you like

15:30.682 --> 15:31.981
about her body, all right?

15:31.983 --> 15:33.950
- Darryl.
- Okay.

15:33.952 --> 15:37.687
Um, I like Erin's hair.
Those are very pretty colors.

15:37.689 --> 15:39.522
- Yeah, right?
- I'm sorry.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.824
- This is for a news audition?
- Yeah.

15:41.826 --> 15:44.327
Then why are we talking
about her looks?

15:44.329 --> 15:46.996
Why not her credibility
or her reliability?

15:46.998 --> 15:49.732
News flash, everyone...
the human race

15:49.734 --> 15:51.734
finds attractive people
more trustworthy.

15:51.736 --> 15:53.202
So sorry, Andy, but for 20 years,

15:53.204 --> 15:55.939
the most trusted man in America...
Walter Cronkite.

15:55.941 --> 15:57.440
Cronkite was hot.

15:57.442 --> 15:59.709
If I could go back in time,
I'd take that moustache ride.

15:59.711 --> 16:01.411
Does Erin have any experience?

16:01.413 --> 16:03.813
Has she taken
any journalism classes, maybe?

16:03.815 --> 16:05.648
Has she done the pageant circuit?

16:05.650 --> 16:08.151
- No, I watch the news...
- She's gonna be amazing.

16:08.153 --> 16:09.852
Look at her.
She's gonna light up the screen.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.220
This is a first for me,

16:11.222 --> 16:12.822
and I don't get a lot of chances,

16:12.824 --> 16:15.558
so I have to take them
really seriously.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.361
I will do whatever it takes
to get the job.

16:18.363 --> 16:20.997
- Whatever it takes.
- Yeah, I know, I heard.

16:25.803 --> 16:28.237
This is it.

16:28.239 --> 16:30.206
- Any questions?
- Is it gonna be numb?

16:30.208 --> 16:32.909
No, it's gonna be
over before you know it.

16:32.911 --> 16:36.646
Mm-hmm.

16:36.648 --> 16:40.249
Afghan president Hamid Karzai
declared a new policy

16:40.251 --> 16:41.985
of dollar days
throughout the country,

16:41.987 --> 16:44.220
promising low, low prices

16:44.222 --> 16:48.091
on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas.

16:48.093 --> 16:50.393
"Aren't you glad you waited?"
Karzai commented.

16:50.395 --> 16:53.830
Um, where did you get that story?

16:53.832 --> 16:55.865
A little bit here,
a little bit there.

16:55.867 --> 16:58.234
I bet you didn't think
I knew current events.

16:58.236 --> 16:59.669
I love it.

16:59.671 --> 17:03.406
It's fantastic.
Now, tag it with your name.

17:03.408 --> 17:05.174
For Channel 11 News, I'm Erin Hannon.

17:05.175 --> 17:08.044
Pause after news.

17:08.046 --> 17:09.878
For Channel 11 News,

17:09.881 --> 17:12.048
- I'm Erin Hannon.
- No, pause longer.

17:12.050 --> 17:14.951
- That was a good one.
- Pause... pause... pause longer.

17:14.953 --> 17:17.053
Okay, build suspense.
Don't be shy.

17:17.055 --> 17:19.821
Got it.

17:19.824 --> 17:23.826
For Channel 11 News...

17:30.701 --> 17:31.801
What, it's...

17:31.803 --> 17:32.802
I'm Erin Hannon.

17:32.804 --> 17:33.936
Okay, all right.

17:33.938 --> 17:35.705
Great.

17:35.707 --> 17:37.373
Some great stuff in there.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.109
I can feel you looking at me.

17:40.111 --> 17:44.947
Okay, well here's something
you don't know.

17:44.949 --> 17:47.083
- A couple of weeks ago...
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.085 --> 17:49.252
I ran into this guy
from my high school

17:49.254 --> 17:51.721
who has just gotten divorced,

17:51.723 --> 17:53.623
and he hit on me in the mall.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.526
And I didn't tell you
because... I don't know,

17:56.528 --> 17:58.561
I felt embarrassed, and I didn't know

17:58.563 --> 18:00.396
if you'd be mad or worried,

18:00.398 --> 18:04.500
but anyway,
I thought you'd wanna know.

18:04.502 --> 18:06.569
That didn't happen.

18:06.571 --> 18:07.970
You would've told me right away.

18:07.972 --> 18:09.839
Yeah, I would've.

18:09.841 --> 18:11.240
What about you?

18:11.242 --> 18:13.776
Come on, there's gotta be something.

18:13.778 --> 18:16.245
Between your birth
and the last two days,

18:16.247 --> 18:18.247
something you just haven't had
the chance to tell me.

18:22.387 --> 18:26.489
Just tell me.

18:26.491 --> 18:28.958
God, give it up, Beesly.
You know me too well.

18:47.579 --> 18:48.711
Hey.

18:48.713 --> 18:51.547
Um, I knew something bothered me,

18:51.549 --> 18:53.082
and I finally figured it out.

18:53.084 --> 18:54.383
What news producers
are gonna wanna see

18:54.385 --> 18:55.985
is how Erin relates
to the other people

18:55.987 --> 18:57.587
on the news team.

18:57.589 --> 19:00.756
The weird thing is Erin
is doing the audition alone.

19:00.758 --> 19:02.024
God.

19:02.026 --> 19:04.894
Now, I'd say Clark
could be your co-host.

19:04.896 --> 19:06.562
He's already doing camera.

19:06.564 --> 19:09.899
Somebody who's already
got rapport with Erin, maybe.

19:09.901 --> 19:11.067
I don't know.

19:13.204 --> 19:15.438
Hey, this is for real this time.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.241
It's gettin' late.

19:18.243 --> 19:22.778
Thought you guys
could use a little inspiration.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.914
A movie.

19:24.916 --> 19:26.983
- What is this?
- <i>127 Hours.</i>

19:26.985 --> 19:28.417
- It's about this guy who...
- No, no, no, no,

19:28.419 --> 19:30.153
- no spoilers. Please.
- My bad, my bad...

19:30.155 --> 19:32.555
- No...
- You're right, okay.

19:32.557 --> 19:34.023
Good night.

19:37.194 --> 19:39.262
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:39.264 --> 19:42.298
- Everybody.
- Yeah.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.399
- Come in.
- All right.

19:43.401 --> 19:44.534
- Come on in.
- Wow!

19:44.536 --> 19:47.069
Thanks.
What are you doing here?

19:47.071 --> 19:48.738
Sorry, man.

19:48.740 --> 19:51.073
Andy thought Erin
need a co-anchor.

19:51.075 --> 19:53.709
I'm his makeup guy.
My hands are tied.

19:53.711 --> 19:55.745
The victim was released

19:55.747 --> 19:58.548
from the hospital
with second-degree burns.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.783
Wow.
You know what they say, Erin?

20:00.785 --> 20:02.218
If you can't take the heat,

20:02.220 --> 20:05.354
get out of the kitchen.

20:05.356 --> 20:07.223
Well, he tried to,
but the fire door was blocked.

20:07.225 --> 20:09.325
- He sure did.
- All right.

20:09.327 --> 20:10.760
We got that.
That's a rap everybody.

20:10.762 --> 20:12.128
It's just... you sure, Clark?

20:12.130 --> 20:13.529
Yep, she's done.

20:13.531 --> 20:15.298
No, I just...
I don't mean Erin.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.868
I mean for me.
I didn't feel good about that.

20:18.870 --> 20:20.369
No, we got it.
We got it.

20:20.371 --> 20:22.939
Great! Let's get some food.
I'm starving.

20:22.941 --> 20:24.540
I don't think we did get it.

20:24.542 --> 20:28.110
I could do a couple more takes.
We could do it in close-up.

20:28.112 --> 20:31.147
That might even be better
for editing.

20:31.149 --> 20:32.782
Okay, I don't.

20:32.784 --> 20:34.483
All right.

20:34.485 --> 20:36.185
I'm hungry.

20:36.187 --> 20:39.755
Pete, you wanna take Erin
to get a burger or something?

20:39.757 --> 20:41.857
- Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
- Okay.

20:41.859 --> 20:42.959
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

20:42.961 --> 20:44.060
- Okay.
- Great job.

20:44.062 --> 20:46.662
So this is a single.

20:46.664 --> 20:48.297
Hey, even this doesn't
work out for me,

20:48.299 --> 20:50.499
I'm just glad I had
the guts to do it,

20:50.501 --> 20:53.502
and maybe it'll work out for Andy.

21:01.447 --> 21:03.014
That is absolutely revolting!

21:03.016 --> 21:05.717
- Yeah.
- He is so good, though...

21:05.719 --> 21:06.785
Yes.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.653
The way he just cuts off his arm.

21:08.655 --> 21:10.355
If you like James Franco,
we really should watch

21:10.357 --> 21:11.856
<i>Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes.</i>

21:11.858 --> 21:13.892
Well, he's a genius, you know?

21:13.894 --> 21:16.928
He was in graduate programs
at Yale, Columbia and NYU

21:16.930 --> 21:18.463
- all at the same time.
- Whoop-de-doo.

21:18.465 --> 21:19.831
That doesn't make you a genius.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.299
Well, it doesn't make you stupid.

21:21.301 --> 21:22.934
Yeah, it does.
Actually, it makes you

21:22.936 --> 21:24.769
- real stupid.
- Stupid like you.

21:24.771 --> 21:26.171
- No, like you.
- Like you.

21:26.173 --> 21:28.640
- You're the stupid one.
- You're the stupid one.

21:28.642 --> 21:31.500
- You, you, you, you, you...
- You're the stupid one.
