I just...

18:59.361 --> 19:01.929
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

19:01.931 --> 19:05.098
Anyway, I thought women
liked it when men cry.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.201
BOTH: Eh...

19:08.503 --> 19:10.637
I cried on "Hoarders."

19:10.639 --> 19:14.308
Second-highest-rated episode...
just saying.

19:17.611 --> 19:19.245
I'm trying to think

19:19.247 --> 19:22.715
of the least offensive way to ask,

19:22.717 --> 19:26.618
"Why is she still here?"

19:26.620 --> 19:28.154
She likes us.

19:28.156 --> 19:29.288
And we like her.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.957
She's just a cool little cat lady

19:30.959 --> 19:33.591
that I'll never turn into.

19:35.362 --> 19:37.729
Honey, I am so sorry.

19:37.731 --> 19:39.764
We should not have done
this behind your back.

19:39.766 --> 19:40.765
It's all right.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.100
Your heart was in the right place,

19:42.102 --> 19:44.069
and I love you all for that.

19:44.071 --> 19:46.271
I love you too.

19:48.475 --> 19:52.276
Mike, I'm sorry I pretended

19:52.278 --> 19:54.411
to be your mother,

19:54.413 --> 19:57.882
and I don't know why your real mom left,

19:57.884 --> 20:01.752
because I would do anything
to be part of this family.

20:01.754 --> 20:04.255
BOTH: Aww.

20:04.257 --> 20:05.489
Thank you...

20:05.491 --> 20:08.824
Fake Linda.

20:08.826 --> 20:12.061
My name is actually Linda.

20:12.063 --> 20:15.498
- Is it?
- No.

20:18.904 --> 20:20.836
Well, look, maybe this is
a sign I shouldn't try

20:20.838 --> 20:23.273
to find my real mom and I
should just concentrate

20:23.275 --> 20:25.807
on the people who actually want
to be a part of my family.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.076
Like me.

20:30.948 --> 20:33.448
Sure, why not?

20:33.450 --> 20:35.450
Forget your mother, Mike.

20:35.452 --> 20:38.020
That woman is nothing but trouble.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.055
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

20:41.057 --> 20:44.258
<i>It's, uh, Mike, your son.</i>

20:44.260 --> 20:48.495
<i>It's, uh, been a long time,
maybe too long a time.</i>

20:48.497 --> 20:52.233
<i>So, if you get this, uh,
please give me a call.</i>
