01:05.599 --> 01:08.368
How is it?
- Nice.

01:09.499 --> 01:14.237
lt's not just nice...it's spectacular.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.035
Because my Shasty ji designed it.

01:19.499 --> 01:21.334
And do you know what l did?

01:24.065 --> 01:25.332
l killed him.

01:27.099 --> 01:28.467
Yes, l killed him.

01:30.432 --> 01:33.034
l.. l killed him.

01:40.532 --> 01:46.471
Birth-Death, Eveything is destined.

01:51.065 --> 01:55.068
From Sita's abduction
to Lanka's destruction.

01:55.332 --> 01:59.703
From Draupadi's ignominy
to the defeat of Kauravs.

02:00.299 --> 02:02.200
Eveything was destined.

02:03.399 --> 02:08.137
The one above us all has
pre-destined eveything for us.

02:09.132 --> 02:14.003
We will have our share of rains.

02:18.432 --> 02:22.969
And only our share of sunshine.

02:27.232 --> 02:32.570
The flipping of the coin
will favour us when it's our time.

02:32.632 --> 02:34.367
Heads!

02:35.032 --> 02:36.967
Eveything is destined.

02:37.399 --> 02:39.400
But the interesting thing is that...

02:39.466 --> 02:45.905
We have no idea where our
share of clouds, sun and coin are?

03:01.966 --> 03:03.534
That's why l say

03:03.833 --> 03:05.834
Keep changing the
direction of the wind.

03:06.099 --> 03:08.568
Keep Collecting sunshine in your fist.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.068
Keep tossing the coin.

03:11.299 --> 03:14.869
Without fail, relentlessly.

03:15.366 --> 03:18.535
Because we are all destined to fly.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.000
4x1 = 4.

04:21.065 --> 04:23.167
4x2 = 8.

04:23.232 --> 04:25.734
4x3 = 12.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.134
4x4 = 16.

04:28.199 --> 04:30.467
4x5 = 20.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.901
4x6 = 24.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.369
4x7 = 28.

04:35.432 --> 04:37.967
4x8 = 32.

04:38.032 --> 04:40.367
4x9 = 36.

04:40.399 --> 04:42.501
4x10 = 40.

04:42.799 --> 04:45.168
4x1 = 4.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.901
4x2 = 8.

04:48.866 --> 04:50.434
Shivkar Talpade!

04:52.899 --> 04:54.500
You're playing right
in the middle of my class.

04:54.766 --> 04:57.235
You're also teaching right
in the middle of my game.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.100
See, children..

05:01.165 --> 05:03.100
At the end of my cane..

05:03.299 --> 05:07.836
..stands the most stupid
person in the world. - That's true.

05:07.899 --> 05:09.033
But which end?

05:09.099 --> 05:12.769
This end or that end?
- Quiet!

05:13.399 --> 05:16.068
Quiet! Learn something
from your nephew, Narayan

05:16.132 --> 05:18.934
Year after year he has
done well at his studies...

05:19.000 --> 05:21.335
..so much so that today
he shares the same bench as you.

05:21.733 --> 05:24.135
And you, your books have been rusting
in the same trunk for years.

05:24.165 --> 05:25.266
Same trunk?

05:25.332 --> 05:26.332
No, sir. l changed my
trunks this morning only.

05:26.399 --> 05:27.666
Quiet.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.936
Do you want to set
a record in failing?

05:34.332 --> 05:36.100
Do you want to study?

05:39.132 --> 05:40.933
Get out.
- Forever?

05:41.132 --> 05:42.867
Get out!
- My bag...

05:43.699 --> 05:45.400
Get out of here.
- Thank you.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.068
Quiet! No one's going anywhere.

05:51.799 --> 05:53.867
l'll teach that scoundrel a lesson.

06:00.099 --> 06:03.635
''Free Flying Heart''

06:09.599 --> 06:12.301
''Free Flying Heart''

06:12.366 --> 06:16.970
''Pay your respects and look above''

06:17.032 --> 06:21.169
''l'm out to hunt with my gun of love.''

06:21.232 --> 06:25.970
''Pay your respects and look above''

06:26.666 --> 06:30.703
''l'm out to hunt with my gun of love.''

06:30.766 --> 06:35.704
''My heart's the prince
of my imaginay world''

06:35.766 --> 06:37.801
''Salute now...here comes...

06:37.866 --> 06:41.736
''Free Flying Heart''

06:47.165 --> 06:50.668
''Free Flying Heart''

07:11.666 --> 07:13.067
What? Signature?

07:13.132 --> 07:15.133
Not just signature...
it's a memorabilia.

07:15.199 --> 07:17.200
lt's always treasured.
- Of glorious people.

07:17.265 --> 07:19.600
l see.
So it's decided.

07:19.666 --> 07:21.000
One day l'll do
something so glorious..

07:21.065 --> 07:22.766
..that you will take
my autograph as well.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.234
And call it.. memorabilia.

07:24.299 --> 07:25.633
Buzz off!

07:25.699 --> 07:26.966
Laughing at me?

07:27.232 --> 07:28.633
Should l prove it to you?

07:29.966 --> 07:32.735
How about a bet?
- Done.

07:33.733 --> 07:38.237
''The sulty night like
a woman is studded with stars...''

07:38.299 --> 07:40.834
''She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon...''

07:40.899 --> 07:43.034
''...stitched onto
it which has no scars...''

07:43.099 --> 07:47.837
''The sulty night like
a woman is studded with a stars...''

07:47.899 --> 07:49.967
''She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon...''

07:50.032 --> 07:52.167
''...stitched onto
it which has no scars...''

07:52.232 --> 07:56.803
''To reveal the mystey,
l scrapped off the moon.''

07:56.866 --> 08:01.837
''There's a hole in the universe
as big as the one in my pocket''

08:01.899 --> 08:04.067
''Not a penny to spare...''

08:04.132 --> 08:06.467
''But a smile on my
face l always share''

08:06.532 --> 08:11.136

08:47.632 --> 08:49.934
Ticket.
- Are you crazy?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.701
Here.

08:51.766 --> 08:53.901
Stopping me from
entering my own house.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.635
Who appointed you? Tell me.
Who?

08:56.699 --> 08:58.634
Your father did.

08:59.165 --> 09:01.534
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

09:01.599 --> 09:04.101
He also had to be born
as my father in my house only.

09:07.866 --> 09:09.567
What has the world come to?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.834
l've to climb the pipe to my own home.

09:12.799 --> 09:14.433
Pant's torn!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.434
Come on..

09:29.499 --> 09:32.435
Start..
- Open up. Lift the curtain.

09:41.799 --> 09:43.667
What the..

09:57.766 --> 10:01.603
Hey Champ!... Come quickly.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.401
Your enty's next.

10:04.699 --> 10:07.101
Me?
- Yes. Come quickly.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.833
You're late.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.000
You aren't even ready.

10:10.065 --> 10:13.735
l told you a thousand
times...you will get me fired.

10:14.499 --> 10:16.934
No touching here, uncle..
- Adjust your dhoti.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.935
What's my name in this play?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.868
Dushyant.
Shankuntala's Dushyant.

10:20.933 --> 10:22.401
Go on now.
Go.

10:22.466 --> 10:28.038
Shakuntala...l am your Dushyant,
and you're my Shakun...

11:04.632 --> 11:05.933
Tie it.

11:08.599 --> 11:10.534
You've been drinking again.

11:10.933 --> 11:12.834
Bloody drunkard.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.868
Do you even remember your lines?

11:15.933 --> 11:18.468
l am in love with you, Shakuntala.

11:18.532 --> 11:20.433
Let's go far away.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.501
Hold me tight.

11:24.566 --> 11:25.733
Don't be so shy.

11:33.933 --> 11:36.435
Sory, l am late.
- Who?

11:36.499 --> 11:38.868
Uncle, it's me.
- Bandya, you?

11:38.933 --> 11:41.468
Yes.
- Then who's that?

11:50.566 --> 11:51.600
Beloved..

11:52.099 --> 11:54.468
Beloved's got red undemear.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.034
You want it?

11:58.499 --> 11:59.900
Who are you?

12:00.332 --> 12:01.733
Who sent him here?

12:03.265 --> 12:06.468
Myself Dushyant... 4th Standard,
Failed eight times.

12:06.532 --> 12:07.866
This is so ironic, friends.

12:08.032 --> 12:10.033
ln the stoy,
Dushyant didn't recognize Shakuntala..

12:10.299 --> 12:12.567
..and now,
Shakuntala doesn't recognize Dushyant.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.434
That's Talpade's useless boy.

12:15.499 --> 12:17.601
Hey... you mean Govind Shambhu Talpade.

12:17.666 --> 12:18.733
Be respecting.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.367
Someone throw him out of here.

12:21.432 --> 12:22.699
Maushi.

12:25.432 --> 12:27.901
l am in love with you Shakuntala.

12:27.966 --> 12:30.601
Let's go far away.
- What's this drama?

12:30.966 --> 12:32.434
Get him out.
- Get him out.

12:32.499 --> 12:35.768
Out. Out.
- Who was that?

12:35.833 --> 12:37.401
Who was that?
- Me.

12:37.466 --> 12:41.469
Rascal...you came here to
watch a drama, didn't you?

12:41.532 --> 12:42.566
So watch.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.568
We want a refund.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.466
We want a refund.

12:47.532 --> 12:48.833
Guard, throw him out.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.568
Maushi, my priceless
heart's at stake here.

12:51.632 --> 12:52.599
And he wants a refund.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.300
Get him out.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.701
Get him out.

12:56.766 --> 12:58.767
Let me go.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.334
Shakuntala you explain them.

13:00.399 --> 13:02.701
Let me go.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.834
My slippers.

13:17.966 --> 13:20.635
Stop. Stop.

13:28.699 --> 13:30.967
Someone catch him.

13:32.299 --> 13:34.200
Stop.

13:35.632 --> 13:37.266
Stop him.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.667
Matches.
- Matches?

14:01.733 --> 14:03.134
What do you intend to do?

14:03.199 --> 14:04.433
Blow up his lordship's bungalow?

14:04.499 --> 14:06.567
When the time comes, you'll
know what my intentions are?. - What?

14:06.632 --> 14:07.666
No...No...

14:07.733 --> 14:10.702
Well... what will be messier?

14:10.766 --> 14:15.470
..your Lordship or his shit?

14:15.532 --> 14:17.800
You're acting smart.
l will search you.

14:17.866 --> 14:20.835
You don't know what a fierce
policeman (Foolishman) l am.

14:20.899 --> 14:24.168
lt tickles.
- Quiet. Stand straight.

14:24.232 --> 14:26.534
l assure you, Mr. Shasty.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.601
ln my custody you'll
be laughing much less.

14:29.666 --> 14:33.870
Wow, sir...you're looking
like Sherlock Holmes.

14:34.132 --> 14:38.469
Chatterjee, Chatter less...and
arrest him. - Yes, sir.

14:51.632 --> 14:52.366
6-O!

14:52.432 --> 14:53.266
6-O!

14:53.332 --> 14:54.166
6-O!

14:54.232 --> 14:55.232
6-O!

14:55.299 --> 14:57.234
Keep running...Talpade!

14:57.299 --> 14:57.899
6-O!

14:58.165 --> 14:59.833
6-O!

15:04.132 --> 15:05.733
Get up.
- Govind Shambhu Talpade..

15:05.799 --> 15:07.534
..is that the way to
wake people up? - What?

15:07.599 --> 15:08.766
Did you hear that, Kaushaliya?

15:08.833 --> 15:12.303
Now your ill-mannered
son will teach us manners?

15:12.366 --> 15:15.302
What's this?
- l don't know.

15:15.466 --> 15:17.634
You don't know..
How could you know?

15:17.699 --> 15:20.435
Education and you are like
the opposite banks of a river.

15:20.499 --> 15:21.766
Give that back.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.601
lt wrong to touch other's belongings.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.100
When will you learn, Govind Shambhu?

15:25.165 --> 15:27.834
And who are you? An idol of learning?

15:28.099 --> 15:30.434
At first it was just
a little fondness for alcohol.

15:30.499 --> 15:33.068
But now you're going
to dance girls as well.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.500
Right?

15:34.566 --> 15:37.702
This is the first time
anyone from the Talpade family..

15:37.766 --> 15:39.801
..was found at a dance girl's place.

15:40.065 --> 15:44.235
You only said...do something
that no one has done before.

15:44.299 --> 15:45.533
And now that l did..

15:45.599 --> 15:47.267
..it's hard for you to pat my back.

15:47.332 --> 15:48.332
Shivy.

15:48.699 --> 15:51.635
Please...just concentrate
on your studies.

15:51.699 --> 15:53.700
You've flunked 8 times.

15:53.766 --> 15:55.334
l can't see it again.

15:55.466 --> 15:58.135
Well...don't get your cataract treated.

15:58.199 --> 15:59.567
And you won't ever see anything again.

15:59.632 --> 16:02.634
Shivy. Quiet. Aren't you ashamed?

16:02.699 --> 16:04.467
What shame, mother?

16:04.532 --> 16:07.201
lf he had any shame, he would know..

16:07.265 --> 16:09.667
..that boys half his age
are struggling for independence.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.734
And he's blabbering nonsense.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.235
Brother,
only slaves fight for liberty.

16:14.699 --> 16:17.201
l am free. From here.

16:17.265 --> 16:20.034
And anyway...we don't just
want freedom from the Brithishers.

16:20.099 --> 16:22.167
Grandma needs freedom
from our traditions..

16:22.232 --> 16:24.067
..which made her shave off her hair.

16:24.232 --> 16:26.100
Mother needs freedom from your fuy.

16:26.165 --> 16:27.733
Poor woman can't speak.
- See!

16:28.000 --> 16:31.169
Sister-in-law needs
freedom from our society.

16:31.232 --> 16:33.233
Which did not let her study.

16:33.299 --> 16:35.768
And brother...you want freedom too...

16:36.032 --> 16:37.299
From me!

16:37.366 --> 16:40.335
And Govind, you need freedom too..

16:40.399 --> 16:41.767
From your orthodoxy.

16:42.032 --> 16:44.167
Because that's the root of all evil.

16:44.232 --> 16:46.467
And after that, we'll no longer beg..

16:46.532 --> 16:49.001
..we would rather snatch
our freedom from the British.

16:49.265 --> 16:50.466
Hey...

16:51.466 --> 16:55.536
Brigadier Shivy Talpade...
of the buffoon battalion.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.567
Wasn't your horn honking enough..

16:57.632 --> 16:59.433
..that now you have
also started shouting.

16:59.499 --> 17:02.335
Not a horn. It's a trumpet.

17:03.566 --> 17:05.434
But, where is it?

17:28.966 --> 17:30.434
Back again to be beaten.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.101
No...No..l just wanted to see whether..

17:33.165 --> 17:35.934
..you still look
beautiful when l am sober.

17:37.332 --> 17:39.400
Come back in the evening.

17:39.466 --> 17:41.968
Stars don't shine in the day.

17:43.632 --> 17:48.169
lt's lying on the
table...your English horn.

17:48.399 --> 17:51.034
Champa picked it up from the stage.

17:51.099 --> 17:52.533
And my heart?

17:52.599 --> 17:54.567
lt's been missing since last night.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.034
l guess that also got left behind.

17:57.532 --> 17:59.267
Did you find it?

17:59.566 --> 18:02.368
You didn't tell me
what you saw. - What?

18:02.432 --> 18:06.969
Do l still look beautiful
after you're sober...or not?

18:08.265 --> 18:09.566
What are you saying?

18:10.032 --> 18:12.334
Liquor is not as
intoxicating as you are.

18:12.499 --> 18:13.900
You look gorgeous.

18:13.966 --> 18:16.201
Those with an empty pocket..

18:16.265 --> 18:18.467
..ty charming with their words.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.634
Anyway, l am used to people like you.

18:21.899 --> 18:24.901
Who often speak nonsense
when they're drunk.

18:25.332 --> 18:29.903
Don't forget, some people often
speak the truth when they are drunk.

18:57.532 --> 19:00.501
This is Shasty's bag. Check it!

19:00.899 --> 19:02.967
There's no book in here, sir.

19:03.032 --> 19:04.566
Some say he's a scientist.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.434
Some say he's a freedom fighter.

19:06.499 --> 19:08.100
l say he's a bomb-maker.

19:08.165 --> 19:11.434
He's a clown,
and you're too worried about him.

19:11.499 --> 19:14.034
Empty-bag...empty stomach..

19:15.566 --> 19:18.435
Empty mind.
- Empty-bag... Empty mind.

19:18.499 --> 19:21.835
They revolted against
the queen, in '57.

19:24.065 --> 19:26.033
Keep an eye on him.
- Sir.

19:54.466 --> 19:56.201
Hey...who's there?

19:56.265 --> 19:57.532
Get down.
- Catch him! Catch him!

19:57.799 --> 20:00.935
Get down.
- Wait. Catch him.

20:03.265 --> 20:05.200
Don't push.

20:06.432 --> 20:11.370
Oh...
- Oh...what are you doing here?

20:11.432 --> 20:13.967
When did you come back
from Benaras.. - Hey.

20:14.032 --> 20:15.233
First tell me, where's my book?

20:15.299 --> 20:18.468
First you tell me,
how did that book get into my shirt?

20:20.099 --> 20:22.201
lf they overhear,
we'll be skinned alive.

20:22.265 --> 20:24.166
Excellent progress.

20:24.232 --> 20:26.400
First brothel and now jail.

20:26.466 --> 20:28.100
He's getting crazier by the day.

20:28.165 --> 20:31.234
Getting crazy is the
sign of getting smart.

20:31.299 --> 20:32.933
According to Charu Saraswati ji..

20:33.000 --> 20:37.003
Look, please don't support him,
Shasty ji.

20:37.065 --> 20:40.101
And next time you find
him lying on the streets..

20:40.165 --> 20:41.866
..l suggest that you take him home.

20:41.933 --> 20:44.468
lt's best if all the
Iunatics stay together.

20:45.132 --> 20:46.800
But the bail papers are ready, sir.

20:46.866 --> 20:48.901
l came here to bail someone,
and so l will.

20:48.966 --> 20:51.935
Not for that oaf, but Shasty instead.

20:52.866 --> 20:53.866
Shasty?

20:53.933 --> 20:56.035
May l remind you,
sir, that he's a suspect?

20:56.099 --> 20:57.533
He's harmless.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.234
He's a bit eccentric, but harmless.

21:00.299 --> 21:02.401
Make sure it's done.
- Yes.

21:04.933 --> 21:05.967
Bail!

21:06.232 --> 21:07.299
Bail!

21:07.866 --> 21:09.000
Bail! Bail! Bail!

21:09.065 --> 21:10.266
Bail!

21:12.299 --> 21:14.267
Thank you.
- Welcome.

21:15.199 --> 21:17.868
You really are stupid.

21:18.265 --> 21:22.035
Sometimes you have
to scratch someone's back..

21:22.232 --> 21:27.370
And then...this one's your own...
Father.

21:28.833 --> 21:30.935
Understood idiot?

21:31.933 --> 21:35.002
Body of iron...brass arms.

21:35.065 --> 21:38.201
Wheels on the legs...and a pointed
nose slicing through the air.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.167
l read it somewhere.

21:43.265 --> 21:44.733
Where's my book?

21:46.099 --> 21:47.300
l know l am an idiot.

21:47.366 --> 21:50.469
But in the current situation,
you have to scratch my back.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.901
Give my bail and take your book.

21:58.866 --> 21:59.733
Sir..

22:07.299 --> 22:08.967
What's he making?

22:09.032 --> 22:10.767
Bomb or something?

22:11.099 --> 22:12.800
Shasty ji hardly
ever makes his hair..

22:12.866 --> 22:14.300
What can he possibly make?

22:14.366 --> 22:15.934
Thank you.

22:17.966 --> 22:20.101
l think he knows something, this one.

22:21.065 --> 22:23.200
He's playing a game with us.

22:37.833 --> 22:38.833
Hey...

22:39.199 --> 22:42.068
l didn't bail you
out for free. - Yeah.

22:42.132 --> 22:44.334
l'll deliver your
book at your address.

22:44.399 --> 22:46.000
My address.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.668
The entire British battalion
doesn't know my address.

22:49.733 --> 22:51.101
He thinks he can find it.

22:51.165 --> 22:53.367
Can't handle a thing.
Neither his book nor his kite.

22:53.432 --> 22:58.770
Pull...Pull..
- No, friend. l got to let it loose.

22:58.833 --> 23:02.236
The wind's blowing from the west,
the sea.

23:02.299 --> 23:07.170
lf l tie it here,
it'll keep floating for several hours.

23:09.332 --> 23:10.766
lt's not saline.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.100
So the wind isn't
blowing from the sea..

23:12.165 --> 23:13.799
..and it won't keep up for hours.

23:14.199 --> 23:15.800
2-3 minutes more.

23:15.866 --> 23:17.267
5 at the most.

23:17.332 --> 23:19.233
lf you want to take a nap..

23:19.299 --> 23:22.335
..then fix two paper wings
on either side of the kite.

23:22.599 --> 23:25.234
They will cut through the wind,
and the kite will keep floating.

23:25.299 --> 23:28.368
Who told you?
- The eagle's wings.

23:28.632 --> 23:30.834
l noticed them while flying kites.

23:31.165 --> 23:32.900
lt's the only bird
that can stay in air..

23:32.966 --> 23:34.967
..for a long time without
flapping it's wings.

23:35.265 --> 23:36.666
Got it?

23:53.165 --> 23:53.932
Shivy.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.068
Any relation with
that girl means suicide.

23:56.632 --> 23:58.734
Think before you do anything.

23:59.199 --> 24:03.770
Sister-in-law,
Iove cannot be rationalized.

24:04.032 --> 24:05.933
So you broke out of prison.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.935
Someone bailed me out.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.102
This mean someone does love you.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.100
Go on...mary her.

24:12.165 --> 24:13.733
What's the problem?

24:13.799 --> 24:15.133
lt's social service.

24:15.265 --> 24:17.100
Education to women,
widow-marriage and..

24:17.165 --> 24:18.900
Prostitute-marriage!

24:23.265 --> 24:26.134
l wish your heart was
as big as your vocabulay..

24:26.199 --> 24:27.934
Till yesterday you
barely grew a moustache..

24:28.000 --> 24:29.735
..and now you have full grown horns!

24:29.799 --> 24:32.001
Look...if you want
to stay in this house..

24:32.065 --> 24:34.167
..then, you'll live by my rules.

24:34.232 --> 24:36.167
Change yourself...
or change your house.

24:38.899 --> 24:40.000
Okay.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.801
Let him go!

24:43.032 --> 24:46.602
Last night...he was lying
on the streets, unconscious.

24:46.666 --> 24:51.604
People thought he was a beggar
and threw these coins at him.

24:57.632 --> 25:00.668
That dance girl has taught
him new means of earning.

25:02.632 --> 25:05.134
Well...whatever it is..

25:05.733 --> 25:07.101
At least it's my hard earned money.

25:07.833 --> 25:10.902
And not taxes extracted
from poor farmers..

25:10.966 --> 25:12.600
..the way you do!

25:13.099 --> 25:14.500
Get out!

25:15.099 --> 25:16.733
Get out!

25:25.232 --> 25:26.466
Shivy!

25:38.699 --> 25:40.634
My dear friend, just watch her dance..

25:40.899 --> 25:42.567
But don't dance to her tunes.

25:42.632 --> 25:45.101
And you just give me money,
not a lecture.

25:45.165 --> 25:48.468
Tailors don't stick pockets
into shirts of paupers like us.

25:48.532 --> 25:51.167
And my father used to say..

25:51.899 --> 25:53.567
When one can't change
the direction of the winds...

25:53.632 --> 25:55.834
l know... one should adjust his sails...

25:55.899 --> 26:01.771
No, Simply board another boat.

26:02.699 --> 26:06.803
And here you have
a ship waiting for you.

27:13.466 --> 27:18.737
Epitome of loyalty!
Have you got my book?

27:21.065 --> 27:23.000
Who gave you the address?

27:23.065 --> 27:24.966
Normally dust deposits on books..

27:25.032 --> 27:26.833
..but, there was sand on this one.

27:26.899 --> 27:28.834
And l saw the cover it was wrapped in.

27:28.899 --> 27:31.034
Duek, a special mix
of cotton and canvas...

27:31.099 --> 27:33.734
..which is used in ships and boats.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.668
l scratched my brains
for few moments.

27:35.733 --> 27:37.434
And made my way here.

27:37.499 --> 27:41.569
By the way, what are you tying to do?

27:41.632 --> 27:44.501
This is beyond your imagination.

27:45.366 --> 27:47.634
Engine. - What?

27:47.699 --> 27:48.866
En... What?

27:48.933 --> 27:52.903
A unique device...
that can pull anything.

27:52.966 --> 27:54.500
By itself.

27:56.099 --> 27:58.935
By itself... but upside down?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.035
Opposite of 'Dev' (God).
- Demon!

28:01.699 --> 28:03.367
Dirty mind.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.265
Dev-Ved.

28:05.332 --> 28:05.965
Ved-Dev.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.800
'Ved' means the knowledge of the Gods.

28:07.866 --> 28:09.667
Read it backwards.

28:13.466 --> 28:15.701
Shloka 312, verse 8..

28:15.766 --> 28:17.501
'Yujur Ved# 

28:17.566 --> 28:20.735
Meaning?
- Meaning..

28:21.032 --> 28:22.833
To do something different..

28:22.899 --> 28:25.468
..you have to turn things around.

28:25.532 --> 28:26.900
Understood?

28:26.966 --> 28:29.034
Govind Shambhu Talpade
always talks nonsense.

28:29.299 --> 28:30.833
But there's one thing
he is right about.

28:30.899 --> 28:32.634
He says, after spending a decade..

28:32.699 --> 28:36.436
..with mad ascetics in Beneras,
Shasty's lost his marbles.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.269
You've become too curt.

28:43.866 --> 28:45.667
l'll pull your tongue out.

28:45.733 --> 28:50.571
Leave the reward for returning
the book, at least lend me some money.

28:50.632 --> 28:55.703
Did you see a board outside..
Shasty Co-operative Bank?

28:55.766 --> 28:56.833
Leave!

28:59.899 --> 29:02.234
What's behind that curtain?

29:04.332 --> 29:06.734
Why do you care?
Get lost.

29:12.332 --> 29:13.666
Shivy!

29:13.733 --> 29:17.536
Shivy! Shivy! Shivy, wait.

29:17.599 --> 29:20.868
Turn the handle of that
machine on the count of three.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.567
Okay?

29:54.866 --> 29:56.467
Yes!

30:06.199 --> 30:09.535
Charu Saraswati ji..

30:10.199 --> 30:13.569
..what else do l turn upside
down to make this engine work?

30:13.632 --> 30:17.836
Mr. Shasty,
can your machine pull anything?

30:17.899 --> 30:20.501
Yes, it can.
- Sure?

30:20.566 --> 30:21.833
Yes.

30:21.899 --> 30:26.336
Then l suggest ...
you finish making it quickly.

30:27.265 --> 30:30.267
So it can pull the
vehicle of my love..

30:31.265 --> 30:33.333
..back on track.

30:36.199 --> 30:39.201
lt's working... chug, chug...chug!

30:40.466 --> 30:42.835
Shivy! Shivy!

30:43.232 --> 30:44.967
Will you work for me?

30:45.232 --> 30:48.401
l will pay you Rs 20 for a month.
Take this.

30:49.499 --> 30:53.269
A man in love is good for nothing.

30:53.699 --> 30:55.667
This is all l need.

30:56.432 --> 30:58.267
And in return...

30:59.332 --> 31:00.800
...you can keep this.

31:01.366 --> 31:03.735
lt's brass, German-made.

31:04.332 --> 31:05.766
Keep it safe.

31:05.833 --> 31:10.337
But this engine... How?

31:10.399 --> 31:13.502
You didn't need to
turn things upside down.

31:13.566 --> 31:16.335
All you had to do was to
turn the steam back into the engine.

31:17.566 --> 31:19.534
Shloka 318 not 312..

31:19.599 --> 31:23.469
Verse 3 not 8. Yajur Ved.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.300
See you.

31:28.332 --> 31:29.599
Keep moving. Keep moving.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.534
Keep moving, the show's houseful.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.133
Leave. Go.

31:34.232 --> 31:35.232
Champa!

31:35.666 --> 31:38.201
You said the house was full.

31:38.366 --> 31:39.467
What's this?

31:39.799 --> 31:40.866
Why?

31:41.366 --> 31:43.701
Can't one man buy all the tickets?

31:51.599 --> 31:55.836
Madam...will you go out with me?

31:56.366 --> 31:59.602
Sitara sells her dance,
not her evenings.

31:59.666 --> 32:02.668
No one can put a price
to anything which is hers.

32:02.733 --> 32:04.501
Neither her evenings..

32:05.466 --> 32:06.667
..nor her art.

32:06.733 --> 32:08.801
You... Who..

32:11.299 --> 32:15.069
So...where will you take me?

32:20.299 --> 32:24.102
lt's light. That means it can fly.

32:36.666 --> 32:38.601
Melt it.
- This?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.235
Yes, melt it down.

32:41.366 --> 32:43.768
Shasty ji, what are you doing?
Give it back.

32:43.833 --> 32:45.834
You sold it to me.

32:46.099 --> 32:47.767
But it's meant for playing.

32:47.833 --> 32:51.536
Maybe for you,
but it's just brass for me.

32:53.499 --> 32:55.334
Hey..

32:59.265 --> 33:04.336
Praise the Lord!

33:04.399 --> 33:08.035
Hail the Lord!

33:08.099 --> 33:11.669
Hail the Lord!

33:12.132 --> 33:14.100
So tell me disciples...

33:14.366 --> 33:16.468
What did Lord Hanuman fly with?

33:16.532 --> 33:18.433
My trumpet

33:18.499 --> 33:20.267
His trumpet.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.100
His trumpet?
- Yes.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.370
But, Shasty ji,
wasn't that his trumpet? - It was.

33:26.432 --> 33:28.400
But he sold it to me.
And l paid him for it.

33:28.466 --> 33:30.000
Later he stole it and ran away.

33:30.065 --> 33:31.499
What's going to happen to this boy?

33:31.566 --> 33:34.502
But, Shasty ji...he hasn't
come home for a long time.

33:36.065 --> 33:38.167
l'll see whether he did or not.

33:38.232 --> 33:40.000
This is Shivi's room.

33:40.065 --> 33:43.201
Shasty ji, mind your back.

33:44.699 --> 33:49.537
Maybe l don't look that way,
but l am still agile.

33:50.265 --> 33:51.699
And young.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.634
Shasty ji.

34:12.699 --> 34:14.100
Did you get hurt?

34:14.165 --> 34:19.069
He may not look that way,
but he's agile.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.565
And young.
- Be quiet.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.404
But the trumpet?
- The trumpet was made of brass.

34:25.933 --> 34:30.137
But your son is a gem.
And l want him.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.168
Good you chucked him out.

34:33.366 --> 34:37.402
Because one doesn't
Iearn to fly in the nest.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.134
He'll fly.

34:41.264 --> 34:42.532
He'll fly.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.266
He'll fly.

34:46.331 --> 34:47.498
He'll fly.

34:49.399 --> 34:51.167
Shivy will fly.

34:52.065 --> 34:53.699
Will Shivy grow wings?

34:53.966 --> 34:57.936
Oh God...l wonder where he is.

34:59.199 --> 35:02.101
Champ...bring a cup of tea.

35:02.432 --> 35:05.968
One? Sitara never shares her tea.

35:06.032 --> 35:09.101
l don't feel like.
- You don't.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.534
No mood or no money?

35:12.199 --> 35:15.502
Get two..
- l can't let my darling pay.

35:15.566 --> 35:17.067
Only one.

35:17.866 --> 35:18.600
Me...

35:19.499 --> 35:21.267
Your darling?

35:21.866 --> 35:24.001
Men like you come by the dozens.

35:25.899 --> 35:29.068
Well...what can you do?

35:29.599 --> 35:31.367
Whatever you say?
- Whatever l say?

35:31.432 --> 35:32.132
Yes.

35:33.566 --> 35:34.867
And what if you don't.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.367
Then l won't show
my face to you again.

35:37.132 --> 35:39.033
And what if l do it?

35:39.366 --> 35:41.301
Then...anything you want.

35:43.265 --> 35:44.532
l am quite a rascal...

35:44.599 --> 35:47.001
l can ask for anything.
- l see.

35:47.065 --> 35:49.233
What will you ask for?

35:53.866 --> 35:57.469
A kiss?

36:02.966 --> 36:04.334
Accepted.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.933
On your lips?

36:11.165 --> 36:12.432
Hmmm

36:14.032 --> 36:15.566
Really?

36:15.833 --> 36:17.434
Don't get so excited.

36:18.232 --> 36:19.800
The reward's quite big..

36:19.866 --> 36:22.034
..so you will have
to do something big for it.

36:22.265 --> 36:24.100
You mean...there's a condition.

36:24.466 --> 36:26.034
Conditions!

36:27.065 --> 36:28.299
Three of them.

36:28.833 --> 36:29.967
First one?

36:32.332 --> 36:33.466
Spell it.

36:34.799 --> 36:38.002
Make these two glasses full.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.500
Second condition.

37:16.366 --> 37:19.736
''For you the moons
and stars l'll pluck.''

37:20.199 --> 37:22.434
''And even break a British officer's
tooth, if you order my lady luck.''

37:22.499 --> 37:26.002
Go get me a British officer's tooth!

37:32.265 --> 37:34.066
So officer, you've a tooth ache.

37:34.132 --> 37:37.034
l need one. One tooth.
- l'm okay.

37:37.099 --> 37:39.134
No.. l'm okay.

37:39.199 --> 37:40.366
Hold on.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.333
Get off me.
- The blessing of tooth-faiy

37:42.399 --> 37:45.068
Darling, spread your legs. Good.

37:54.265 --> 37:56.467
Come on..

38:02.032 --> 38:04.267
Was your mother also like this?

38:04.332 --> 38:06.867
l remember nothing.

38:07.966 --> 38:10.101
Except that there was someone..

38:10.366 --> 38:14.103
..who would oil my
hair and tie a braid.

38:15.733 --> 38:17.301
Must be my mother.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.368
By the way, you forgot all
about the conditions and the reward.

38:24.332 --> 38:26.200
Shivy never forgets anything.

38:26.265 --> 38:28.367
And l can't collect my reward..

38:28.432 --> 38:30.033
..without completing
all the conditions.

38:30.766 --> 38:33.435
So...your third condition.

38:33.699 --> 38:35.767
Sitara never forgets too.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.768
l will tell you my
third condition too..

38:38.733 --> 38:40.201
But when the time's right.

38:41.165 --> 38:42.432
Crazy boy..

38:42.699 --> 38:44.667
Mary this crazy boy.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.768
l admit he is a bit stupid, a fool..

38:47.065 --> 38:48.666
..but, he is one in a million.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.332
Mary him.

38:50.899 --> 38:54.202
Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, mary him!

38:54.265 --> 38:55.766
What a childish demand?

38:55.833 --> 38:57.100
Mary him!

38:57.165 --> 39:00.067
Dance girls don't get married.
- Why not?

39:00.132 --> 39:01.766
Mary him.

39:01.833 --> 39:04.202
You're a blue-blood, and l'm a harlot.

39:04.265 --> 39:05.733
Mary him.

39:05.799 --> 39:07.700
Our worlds are different, Shivy.

39:07.766 --> 39:09.200
He will change eveything, mary him.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.033
Even if eveything changes..

39:11.666 --> 39:14.001
..it can't change the fact,
that l'm of a lower caste.

39:14.065 --> 39:15.766
And...l am of a higher caste.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.334
Scores settled.

39:17.866 --> 39:20.802
You don't settle scores
in love like this.

39:20.866 --> 39:24.703
There are no scores in love.

39:29.899 --> 39:31.300
Get some sleep.

39:32.966 --> 39:34.634
Will you then mary me?

39:40.799 --> 39:44.969
When l wake up,
you'll be here...right?

40:59.866 --> 41:02.068
Sitarat is only good for some fun.

41:03.032 --> 41:04.633
Not for falling in love.

41:06.099 --> 41:07.567
Don't ty to find me.

41:29.666 --> 41:38.007
''O naive heart,
what has befallen you?''

41:39.766 --> 41:48.107
''After all what's
the cure...for this pain?''

41:49.833 --> 41:58.107
''O naive heart,
what has befallen you?''

42:05.065 --> 42:06.733
Drinking on the streets?

42:07.165 --> 42:07.999
You dare offend the law..

42:08.065 --> 42:11.701
..that too in officer
Chatterjee's area? - What is..

42:11.933 --> 42:15.169
..the punishment for this offence.
- 6 months ofjail.

42:18.599 --> 42:21.768
And...for breaking a heart.

42:21.833 --> 42:31.209
''l have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...''

42:31.933 --> 42:41.042
''l have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...''

42:41.733 --> 42:49.574
''l have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...''

42:49.632 --> 42:57.873
''who knows not what faith is''

42:59.566 --> 43:07.840
''who knows not what faith is''

43:09.532 --> 43:17.873
''O naive heart,
what has befallen you?''

43:19.599 --> 43:30.109
''O naive heart,
what has befallen you?''

43:57.399 --> 43:59.067
This is no time to drink tea.

43:59.899 --> 44:02.434
Yeah, this is the
time to get high, rather.

44:03.499 --> 44:04.967
Should l offer you some more liquor?

44:06.866 --> 44:08.901
You brought me here to lecture me?

44:08.966 --> 44:11.768
l took your father's advice.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.469
lf l find you lying somewhere..

44:14.799 --> 44:16.367
..l should bring you home.

44:16.432 --> 44:17.566
And so l did.

44:17.632 --> 44:20.368
Why are you doing this?
For me?

44:20.432 --> 44:22.467
Not for you...

44:23.933 --> 44:25.534
... for myself.

44:25.899 --> 44:28.334
l need you.

44:31.366 --> 44:33.901
There's something about you.
- What?

44:33.966 --> 44:39.638
Something...that's rare
in humans these days.

44:39.966 --> 44:42.702
lt's only found in dogs.

44:43.666 --> 44:47.870
You've a specialty,
and that's loyalty.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.436
Whatever you do,
you do it with a tinge of loyalty.

44:51.499 --> 44:55.636
Whether it was the trumpet, or Sitara.

44:57.933 --> 44:59.567
What's the point?

45:00.499 --> 45:01.399
She's gone.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.569
She hasn't gone beyond
the moon and the stars, right?

45:05.899 --> 45:10.336
There are some things,
which no matter how far they are...

45:10.399 --> 45:11.767
..can be seen.

45:11.833 --> 45:14.435
Moon and the stars are in the sky.

45:20.699 --> 45:24.035
So why don't you
build a home in the sky?

45:25.632 --> 45:28.868
High above...in the clouds.

45:29.799 --> 45:32.835
And when you'll look down..

45:32.899 --> 45:36.269
..she will be looking at you too.

45:36.766 --> 45:38.801
But how will l get there?

45:42.666 --> 45:44.334
On a plane.

45:44.799 --> 45:47.268
Let's build a plane together.

45:47.332 --> 45:48.733
Hold on. Okay.

45:49.499 --> 45:50.466
Plane...
- Yes.

45:50.532 --> 45:51.666
'Pushpak Vimaan# 
(Air borne plane)

45:51.733 --> 45:54.769
People will use to travel around.

45:54.833 --> 45:56.534
From here to there..

45:56.599 --> 45:58.300
Like a flying ship.

45:58.366 --> 46:00.634
Like a ship that sails on water..

46:00.699 --> 46:03.201
..similarly, an air-plane
that shall sail on clouds?

46:03.265 --> 46:06.601
What did you say?

46:08.466 --> 46:10.467
An air-plane.

46:10.532 --> 46:12.233
An air-plane.

46:12.599 --> 46:15.335
Wow! What a name?

46:15.599 --> 46:17.901
Yes. Air-plane.

46:19.366 --> 46:21.568
l was the one who consumed
liquor and you've gotten drunk.

46:21.632 --> 46:24.868
No one's built an
air-plane in the world.

46:29.466 --> 46:30.466
What a man!

46:42.199 --> 46:44.401
l am sober again.

46:50.666 --> 46:55.404
l am vey close...yet quite far.

46:55.466 --> 46:58.268
The English don't want
me to complete my invention.

46:58.332 --> 47:00.701
They can kill me anytime.

47:00.766 --> 47:03.835
Your life's in threat
because of an airplane.

47:03.899 --> 47:07.302
lt might be just an
airplane for the people.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.401
A scientific marvel.

47:09.532 --> 47:13.202
But it's a revolution for me.

47:13.833 --> 47:17.136
lt's the ray of hope,
which shall encourage..

47:17.199 --> 47:18.633
..these enslaved people, that..

47:18.699 --> 47:20.767
..we're as good as anyone else.

47:20.833 --> 47:23.135
We can be independent too.

47:23.399 --> 47:26.301
They can restrain us on earth.

47:26.699 --> 47:31.403
But how can they stop
us from soaring in the sky?

47:32.332 --> 47:34.500
Shivy, Indians will fly...

47:34.566 --> 47:36.401
..towards an independent future.

47:36.466 --> 47:40.703
The first flying man in
the world...will be an Indian.

47:41.366 --> 47:43.234
That's my dream.

47:44.733 --> 47:46.434
Would you like to see?

47:47.366 --> 47:50.469
Would you like to see
my dream with your eyes?

48:03.265 --> 48:04.399
Come on.

48:09.065 --> 48:11.500
Now...jump.

48:12.466 --> 48:13.700
Come on.

48:14.132 --> 48:15.166
What are you saying?

48:15.232 --> 48:16.566
lt's nothing, Just go.
- No.

48:16.632 --> 48:18.367
Put on your glasses.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.401
Will you get me killed?

48:32.132 --> 48:34.400
Pull the rope!

48:34.466 --> 48:36.434
Pull the rope!

49:01.399 --> 49:04.301
Shasty Ji, l am your assistant,
but who is mine.

49:04.366 --> 49:06.634
You also need an assistant?

49:07.432 --> 49:08.399
But who?

49:08.466 --> 49:10.501
Shasty Ji, me!

50:04.699 --> 50:09.570
''To shine like a star...''

50:10.399 --> 50:15.337
''..you have to burn like one.''

50:16.099 --> 50:21.137
''To shine like a diamond...''

50:21.632 --> 50:27.004
''Be ready to be cut like one.''

50:27.299 --> 50:32.537
''To be immortal like time...''

50:32.599 --> 50:37.670
''You have to be on
a constant move.''

50:50.132 --> 50:51.333
Oh; isn't it the same book?

50:51.766 --> 50:53.667
lt's not just a book,
it's a treasure.

50:53.733 --> 50:59.004
Treasure full of details
about making an airplane.

50:59.499 --> 51:01.534
l never showed it to anyone.

51:01.599 --> 51:03.267
For l couldn't find
anyone trustworthy.

51:03.332 --> 51:05.267
l built a steam-engine.

51:05.332 --> 51:08.001
First with helium,
then l tried with nitrogen.

51:08.065 --> 51:11.134
But eveything failed.
Gasoline.

51:12.466 --> 51:15.435
l need you, Shasty ji, not this book.

51:16.232 --> 51:17.933
Keep tying out your ideas.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.069
And l will be right beside you,
as your trusted aide.

51:23.399 --> 51:32.040
But...the British should never
Iay their hands on this book.

51:32.099 --> 51:33.934
Remember that stoy..?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.302
..where the beast's heart
was in the parrot's body.

51:36.366 --> 51:39.335
My heart dwells in this.

51:39.666 --> 51:41.567
l am alive as long as this exists.

51:41.632 --> 51:45.068
lf this is dead, so am l.

52:01.566 --> 52:02.633
Heads!

52:03.499 --> 52:05.067
This is cheating. You always win.

52:05.132 --> 52:07.934
Look...we can toss the coin..

52:08.000 --> 52:11.269
..but only He decides whether
it'll be heads or tails.

52:11.366 --> 52:14.102
When it's your turn to fly..

52:14.165 --> 52:17.134
..this coin will definitely favor you.

53:22.566 --> 53:25.402
Where did these dark clouds come from?

53:25.466 --> 53:27.367
lt can't be gasoline.

53:27.432 --> 53:30.802
From Lanka to Ayodhya, how could Lord
Ram not encounter any dark clouds?

53:30.866 --> 53:32.300
lt's clearly written
in the scriptures..

53:32.366 --> 53:35.302
Light yellow is fuel's
colour... It's not a name.

53:36.432 --> 53:37.266
So you know think more than me?

53:37.332 --> 53:40.168
All l know is that we're depending
too much on the scriptures.

53:40.232 --> 53:43.268
Tying to build an air-plane
based on old mythological books?

53:48.199 --> 53:51.101
Meaning...year 120O

53:51.165 --> 53:52.432
1000.

53:52.499 --> 53:54.534
8 miles..

53:54.799 --> 53:56.867
And Bhanu..
- l know.. Sun!

53:56.933 --> 53:58.134
Now multiply all three.

53:58.199 --> 54:00.134
1200x1000x8... what do we have?

54:00.199 --> 54:01.333
9,60,OO,OOO miles.

54:01.399 --> 54:03.033
The distance between earth and sun.

54:03.099 --> 54:04.433
And these things are mentioned..

54:04.499 --> 54:07.935
..in a mythological
book like these.

54:08.399 --> 54:11.235
Mr. Shasty...these
things can impress kids..

54:11.299 --> 54:12.933
..but can't make an air-plane fly.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.502
You don't trust me, do you?
- No, l don't.

54:15.766 --> 54:17.868
So leave.
- Fine...l am going.

54:17.933 --> 54:19.034
Leave.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.034
Tying to teach me!

54:36.833 --> 54:38.234
So you're back.

54:38.299 --> 54:40.768
Back in 4.5 hours.

54:41.065 --> 54:43.000
Last time you took 6.

54:43.899 --> 54:45.934
Don't make me furious,
or l'll leave again.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.400
So go.

54:47.466 --> 54:49.167
Who's stopping you?
Leave now.

54:49.232 --> 54:50.833
You go. - This is my house,
why should l?

54:50.899 --> 54:52.500
What are you saying?
- Be quiet.

54:58.366 --> 55:00.768
When did this arrive?
You didn't tell me.

55:00.833 --> 55:02.100
There's nothing to say.

55:02.666 --> 55:07.937
The king of Baroda
has denied our request.

55:08.065 --> 55:14.805
Shivy...seems like our
destiny is out for a stroll.

55:16.132 --> 55:21.136
Shasty ji, one shouldn't
depend on destiny too much.

55:21.199 --> 55:25.269
Even the unfortunate do have a fate.

55:27.933 --> 55:30.935
You don't look stupid, but you are.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.668
Man will fly.

55:35.432 --> 55:36.900
Faiytale.

55:36.966 --> 55:40.002
ln real life,
faiytales don't come true.

55:40.666 --> 55:43.168
l am sory,
l don't believe in your claims.

55:43.966 --> 55:45.767
But you believe in Lord Ram, right?

55:45.833 --> 55:47.000
The 'Pushpak Vimaan'..

55:47.065 --> 55:50.168
..in which Lord Ram
flew from Lanka to Ayodhya.

55:50.232 --> 55:52.100
You're talking about mythology.

55:52.165 --> 55:53.132
Myth...

55:53.332 --> 55:56.334
That's a lie.
Unfortunately, your highness.

55:56.399 --> 55:59.668
These stories have
no relation with reality.

55:59.733 --> 56:01.267
Even we've read in scriptures.

56:01.332 --> 56:03.934
That God's could
communicate from a distance.

56:04.199 --> 56:06.367
And Graham Bell's telephone
does the same thing.

56:06.632 --> 56:09.267
Railways,
motor cars...phonogram, telegram..

56:09.332 --> 56:11.667
All these faiytales
are now coming true.

56:11.733 --> 56:13.968
Because we're unraveling
the mysteries behind them.

56:14.032 --> 56:15.733
Mysteries will keep unraveling..

56:15.799 --> 56:17.700
..and slowly all these
tales will turn into reality.

56:17.766 --> 56:22.170
His highness,
if what we built wasn't commendable..

56:22.232 --> 56:25.935
..then the British
wouldn't be after us.

56:26.265 --> 56:29.368
You mean...the English are ignorant..

56:29.632 --> 56:32.201
..and you two are smart.

56:33.232 --> 56:36.969
Have we ever built
anything before them?

56:41.666 --> 56:45.870
Ayabhatt invented 'Zero'
before the rest of the world.

56:45.933 --> 56:47.000
'Zero'.

56:47.065 --> 56:51.135
Saint Kannad...discovered an
'Atom' before the rest of the world.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.133
'Atom# 

56:52.199 --> 56:55.268
5,OOO years ago,
Diamond was discovered in India.

56:55.332 --> 56:59.102
And l reckon the British...
didn't even exist back then.

56:59.165 --> 57:01.634
Your Highness, do you know..

57:01.699 --> 57:04.201
..why faiytales
don't turn into reality?

57:05.265 --> 57:07.266
Because in a haste to grow up..

57:07.532 --> 57:09.767
..we forget to think like kids.

57:10.866 --> 57:13.735
Man shall fly... an air-plane shall fly.

57:13.799 --> 57:16.168
We just need your help
to turn this tale into reality.

57:16.232 --> 57:18.901
And yes...we're not stupid.

57:19.199 --> 57:20.800
Just a little eccentric.

57:23.833 --> 57:26.869
How much money do
these eccentrics need?

57:27.599 --> 57:30.001
''Bless me with your grace.''

57:30.065 --> 57:32.634
''Lord smiles through your face.''

57:32.699 --> 57:37.570
''A stone turns into
a gem at your place.''

57:37.632 --> 57:42.737
''With your mere touch
you change people's fates''

57:42.799 --> 57:47.270
''You are a saint with Godly traitsq''

57:56.766 --> 58:01.871
''Cannons will be fired...in our honor.''

58:02.866 --> 58:06.202
''And those cannons will be official''

58:07.632 --> 58:11.969
''Cannons will be fired...in our honor.''

58:12.899 --> 58:16.669
''Those cannons will be official''

58:17.499 --> 58:22.103
''Someday our faces...''

58:23.000 --> 58:27.571
''will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real''

58:33.132 --> 58:38.203
''will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real''

58:44.799 --> 58:50.771
''You and only you''

58:50.833 --> 58:55.837
''You are the pen as well
as the ink in which it is dipped''

58:55.966 --> 58:59.936
''You are the alphabet
as well as the script)''

59:00.000 --> 59:02.869
''You are the kingdom as well its king''

59:02.933 --> 59:05.669
''You are benevolent, as well as cruel''

59:05.733 --> 59:10.704
''You are free as well as like
a bird which has lost its wing''

59:10.766 --> 59:13.468
''You're the punishment
and the relief.''

59:13.532 --> 59:15.967
''You are happiness as well as grieF'

59:16.032 --> 59:20.836
''You are the whole
army as well as its chieF'

59:31.132 --> 59:38.172
''Along with the Sun we
will enjoy biscuits and bun)''

59:38.866 --> 59:45.973
''Moon will also get addicted
to Cutting chai coz it will be fun)''

59:46.566 --> 59:56.008
''From the shelf of the
sky...we'll pick some stars.''

59:56.632 --> 01:00:01.036
''Turning them into lanterns''

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:05.803
''...we shall hang them on our door''

01:00:06.432 --> 01:00:10.602
''Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes''

01:00:11.699 --> 01:00:15.602
''The world will become
a miraculous place, it's a deal''

01:00:16.566 --> 01:00:20.903
''Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes''

01:00:21.866 --> 01:00:25.803
''The world will become a
miraculous place, it's a deal)''

01:00:26.432 --> 01:00:30.969
''Someday our faces...''

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:34.701
''...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real''

01:00:34.766 --> 01:00:36.767
''Bless me with your grace.''

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.535
''Lord smiles through your face.''

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:42.134
''A stone turns into
a gem at your place.''

01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:44.901
''...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real''

01:00:44.966 --> 01:00:49.670
''With your mere touch
you change people's fates''

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:54.904
''You are a saint with Godly traits.''

01:01:02.065 --> 01:01:06.736
''...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real''

01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:20.700
Move. Move...what's going on?

01:01:24.733 --> 01:01:25.567
Quiet!

01:01:31.499 --> 01:01:33.734
lt's not a bomb,
it's a flying machine.

01:01:33.799 --> 01:01:35.433
That's what my sources have told me.

01:01:35.499 --> 01:01:37.100
And that too, based on the Vedas.

01:01:37.366 --> 01:01:39.601
That's what my sources
have told me, sir.

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:42.802
Wilson...l believe
you're up for promotion.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.537
And if my sources are right,
be prepared for a transfer.

01:01:48.699 --> 01:01:51.468
Sir...monkeys cannot make machines.

01:01:51.532 --> 01:01:53.800
At least not without metal.

01:01:53.866 --> 01:01:54.967
Sir..!

01:01:56.332 --> 01:01:58.901
Let me see how will the plane fly..?

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:09.367
No one will sell metal to us.

01:02:09.432 --> 01:02:11.467
No shopkeeper or any junk-seller.

01:02:11.532 --> 01:02:13.533
A monkey can stop jumping around..

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:15.734
..but the British will
never stop inte_ering.

01:02:17.265 --> 01:02:20.001
How will l build the wings now?

01:02:20.466 --> 01:02:23.302
With my..
- Let's use wood?

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:29.736
Who are you writing to? Your mother?

01:02:31.299 --> 01:02:36.637
Why don't you ever post it?

01:02:36.699 --> 01:02:38.867
l told you 'Wood'.

01:02:41.032 --> 01:02:42.366
Don't wory.

01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:44.600
l'll post it when the time's right.

01:02:45.466 --> 01:02:46.767
Whenever l talk to him..

01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:49.035
..it feels like l
am talking to a mirror.

01:02:54.032 --> 01:02:55.666
Me as well...

01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:59.835
l couldn't say anything either.

01:03:00.499 --> 01:03:03.401
Come on,
we'll make the wings out of wood.

01:03:03.466 --> 01:03:05.835
We made it of wood the last time.

01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:07.567
But it broke under the weight.

01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:11.903
What do l do with the king's money?

01:03:12.566 --> 01:03:15.602
The British never learn,
so we won't either.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.534
No one will sell metal to you..

01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:19.901
..but, they will certainly
tender you coins.

01:03:19.966 --> 01:03:21.200
Coins?

01:03:29.232 --> 01:03:31.901
Sir, it's considered sacred.
Melting it would be a sin. - l know.

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.667
l will be the sinner.

01:03:33.733 --> 01:03:37.403
Make it in this shape.

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:42.300
lt'll be done!

01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:52.366
Father...

01:03:53.532 --> 01:03:56.201
Give the young man first.
- No, no.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.700
Sir, guests are like God.

01:03:58.766 --> 01:04:02.536
lf you don't eat,
then l'll be the sinner for sure.

01:04:02.599 --> 01:04:04.300
Go on.

01:04:04.366 --> 01:04:07.502
l'll eat.
But first...do you go to school?

01:04:07.566 --> 01:04:08.900
She's in class 2.

01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:12.234
What's your name?
- Sitara.

01:04:13.499 --> 01:04:15.701
Recite the bird poem for him.

01:04:16.232 --> 01:04:19.735
Collecting little by little.
She delicately makes her nest.

01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:23.836
Smiles through winters,
summers and rains.

01:04:23.899 --> 01:04:27.202
Smiles in evey test.

01:04:28.199 --> 01:04:31.201
Sitara Devi...l finished building it.

01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:34.267
lt's ready.

01:04:34.566 --> 01:04:37.802
When l pour gasoline...
the engine will start to roar.

01:04:37.866 --> 01:04:40.501
And this thing will churn around,
cutting through the wind.

01:04:40.632 --> 01:04:42.533
And due the air pressure,
the air-plane..

01:04:42.599 --> 01:04:43.833
..will fly up in the air.

01:04:44.299 --> 01:04:45.667
Eveyone shall applaud.

01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:51.770
But l didn't come
here to tell you that?

01:04:53.532 --> 01:04:58.103
l came here to say that...
l feel scared.

01:04:59.532 --> 01:05:01.166
Vey scared.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.534
This time when you come
back l won't let you leave.

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:09.768
Can't you come back?

01:05:15.799 --> 01:05:17.767
Come back!

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:19.533
Come back!

01:05:31.799 --> 01:05:33.433
What are you wearing, Mr. Shasty.

01:05:33.499 --> 01:05:36.468
Wear this green coat today.

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:37.566
No.

01:05:37.799 --> 01:05:42.737
l'll wear that the day
l'll take-off in the air-plane.

01:05:44.632 --> 01:05:48.602
Or the day l fly off myself.

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:53.833
This one's fine for today.

01:05:54.099 --> 01:05:55.233
Come on.

01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:08.767
What happened?

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:11.267
Will it fly high enough so that..

01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:13.033
..Sitara can watch it from anywhere?

01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:16.101
Hey...You said so.

01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:23.038
At 10:22...the sunrays will
make a 48 degree triangle..

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:26.235
..and the gasoline
will boil in the engine.

01:06:26.366 --> 01:06:30.036
The air-plane will
fly...at exactly 10:22.

01:06:30.099 --> 01:06:32.568
On that note...say cheese!

01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:36.267
Gloy to..
- Tilak!

01:06:36.332 --> 01:06:37.533
Gloy to..
- Tilak!

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.067
Gloy to..
- Tilak!

01:06:39.132 --> 01:06:41.100
Gloy to..
- Mother India!

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:42.666
Tilak!
- Yes.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.667
l heard an air-plane's
going to fly here.

01:06:45.733 --> 01:06:47.101
Did you see it?

01:06:47.165 --> 01:06:48.332
Hope it didn't take-off yet?

01:06:49.232 --> 01:06:52.435
You're here to see our air-plane?

01:06:53.432 --> 01:06:57.302
No...to witness the
first flight of freedom.

01:10:33.465 --> 01:10:35.400
Sir, why do you think the
Viceroy called us here?

01:10:35.432 --> 01:10:37.567
l'm vey sure it's
about those two Indians.

01:10:37.732 --> 01:10:38.799
l warned you about them.

01:10:41.699 --> 01:10:43.434
Good morning, your highness.

01:10:48.465 --> 01:10:51.334
Still biter..
- Do you know why, Governor?

01:10:53.565 --> 01:10:57.468
lndia is a poor land
of uneducated tribal's..

01:10:57.565 --> 01:11:00.134
..and snake charmers and Sadhus.

01:11:00.165 --> 01:11:01.766
ln colonizing, it is we..

01:11:02.032 --> 01:11:04.234
..who have done them a favor.

01:11:04.298 --> 01:11:08.301
lt's taken us years to
paint that image in the west.

01:11:08.399 --> 01:11:10.167
And if a news like this gets out now..

01:11:10.198 --> 01:11:12.133
..that image will be shattered.

01:11:12.699 --> 01:11:15.068
lt seems to me,
that right under your bloody noses...

01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:16.666
..these Indians have been building..

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:18.667
..some kind of flying machine.

01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:20.367
And what have you been doing?

01:11:20.432 --> 01:11:21.699
Snoring.

01:11:22.399 --> 01:11:25.068
Captain,
put him behind bars immediately.

01:11:25.098 --> 01:11:28.067
And what?
Make him into a national hero?

01:11:28.365 --> 01:11:31.634
You need to be clever,
but l want that book.

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:35.467
l want my tea to taste sweet.

01:11:37.165 --> 01:11:39.567
Give me the number six spanner.

01:11:39.632 --> 01:11:42.501
Kaka, the number six spanner.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:51.135
Shasty Ji,
l can handle this simple machine.

01:11:51.198 --> 01:11:53.333
But you take charge
of that complex one.

01:11:53.432 --> 01:11:55.133
l wonder what he's doing.

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:56.433
Sitara! Sitara!

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:04.036
Shivy! Two tickets for Kolkata.

01:12:04.232 --> 01:12:06.233
Tagore's called for us.

01:12:06.298 --> 01:12:08.600
He wants to honor us.

01:12:11.365 --> 01:12:14.601
Shivy...tell me something.

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:20.135
Are you sure...it was her.

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:24.535
Fine...
Narayan, are you finished yet?

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:28.702
Hury up... We've to go
find an aunt for your uncle.

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:31.267
For the wedding you'll
need money, sir.

01:12:33.332 --> 01:12:36.968
Two rupees...is that
what they are paying for..

01:12:37.032 --> 01:12:38.633
The Star Inventor!

01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:42.067
A National Hero, is it?

01:12:42.332 --> 01:12:44.267
What do you say to 5000 rupees..

01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:46.467
..with a single stroke of the pen.

01:12:47.165 --> 01:12:48.633
l need the book.

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:55.103
And l think...right now
you need something to eat.

01:12:56.265 --> 01:12:57.933
Samosa!

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:03.899
Too hot.

01:13:03.966 --> 01:13:07.202
Hot means steaming
hot...or hot means spicy.

01:13:07.265 --> 01:13:08.532
Miser Englishmen.

01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:11.334
They make a single
word do the work of two!

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:17.469
But thankfully, we've two words.

01:13:17.565 --> 01:13:22.136
You choose one, yes or no!

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:26.168
Mr. Shasty, 6000 is the
absolute limit l can offer you.

01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:29.534
The most l can offer you is this.

01:13:29.599 --> 01:13:30.900
'Jalebi'.

01:13:31.832 --> 01:13:35.535
l will take it, but the Viceroy
won't take no for an answer.

01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:38.200
Othemise...He'll make
your life the way you like it.

01:13:38.298 --> 01:13:41.034
Hot and spicy.

01:13:41.265 --> 01:13:43.500
Good day to you, Mr. Shasty.

01:13:43.599 --> 01:13:46.134
Good day, sir.

01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:55.268
Shivy...a simple machine..

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.934
..tightened the noose
around their neck.

01:13:58.165 --> 01:14:01.301
When we really fly on a plane..

01:14:01.832 --> 01:14:02.499
..then they will..

01:14:02.599 --> 01:14:06.169
Freak out in their rants
and leak out in their pants!

01:14:14.298 --> 01:14:15.932
Don't let this chance go by.

01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:18.201
Or you will be fixing
machines all your life like me.

01:14:18.298 --> 01:14:19.265
Run!

01:14:47.032 --> 01:14:48.199
Where's Sitara?

01:14:48.932 --> 01:14:52.135
One star sets and the other rises.

01:14:52.232 --> 01:14:54.033
That's the tradition here.

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.233
Where's Sitara?

01:14:57.499 --> 01:15:01.035
lt's easier to find
the address of clouds.

01:15:01.198 --> 01:15:03.466
A particular lane...or an area maybe.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:06.268
But dance girls are difficult to find.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.832
Where's Sitara?

01:15:28.532 --> 01:15:35.005
The day she stopped pe_orming...
we bid her farewell.

01:15:37.465 --> 01:15:40.234
Come on, Champa. Your enty.

01:15:46.866 --> 01:15:52.037
6/1 7...Patil Chowk. Dadar

01:16:01.399 --> 01:16:08.873
''l offer my life to you.''

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:16.339
''l offer my life to you.''

01:16:16.365 --> 01:16:24.172
''l offer my life to you.''

01:16:24.198 --> 01:16:34.041
''l don't know anything
else as a prayer?''

01:16:34.132 --> 01:16:44.041
''O na'ive heart...what's befallen you?''

01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:48.333
Haven't got rid of the habit
of climbing through windows?

01:16:48.632 --> 01:16:52.002
You never made a relation
that allowed me through the door.

01:16:52.866 --> 01:16:54.200
Why did you leave?

01:16:56.198 --> 01:16:58.266
You had fallen in love with me.

01:16:59.632 --> 01:17:01.100
Wanted to mary me.

01:17:01.198 --> 01:17:02.365
And you?

01:17:02.632 --> 01:17:05.368
lt may be easier to bind water.

01:17:06.999 --> 01:17:09.000
But dance girls don't get married...

01:17:09.032 --> 01:17:11.000
So why did you come back that day?

01:17:11.932 --> 01:17:16.369
That wasn't the first day...you
just spotted me that day.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:17.766
l noticed you many times..

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.767
..in the market with Shasty ji.

01:17:21.132 --> 01:17:24.869
l even stood under your window.
- Why didn't you come up?

01:17:27.065 --> 01:17:30.101
l couldn't climb up pipes, like you,

01:17:35.098 --> 01:17:40.570
Maybe dance girls don't,
but cotton-cleaners do get married.

01:17:41.766 --> 01:17:43.234
Mary him.

01:17:44.565 --> 01:17:45.866
l am not beautiful anymore.

01:17:45.899 --> 01:17:47.200
You never were.

01:17:47.232 --> 01:17:48.600
Mary him.

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:53.067
l no longer have the same grace,
or attitude.

01:17:53.165 --> 01:17:54.733
Mary him.

01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:57.268
l am neck-deep in debt.
- Mary him.

01:17:57.332 --> 01:17:58.933
You built an air-plane.
- Mary him.

01:17:59.032 --> 01:18:00.233
The first one in the world.
- Mary him.

01:18:00.265 --> 01:18:02.200
Your pictures get
published in the papers.

01:18:02.265 --> 01:18:04.600
l will leave eveything.
Mary me.

01:18:05.665 --> 01:18:07.066
Mary me.

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:27.900
Sitara ji...

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:29.701
Sitara!

01:18:30.565 --> 01:18:32.700
Can l get some more time?

01:18:32.766 --> 01:18:34.134
l've run out of pages of my ledger..

01:18:34.232 --> 01:18:37.602
..but you don't seem to
run out of time to repay my debt.

01:18:38.232 --> 01:18:40.567
You say you don't have money.

01:18:40.932 --> 01:18:42.933
And here you are..
- Brother..

01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:45.868
Hands to yourself.
- Old flame?

01:18:46.665 --> 01:18:47.999
l am not new to her either.

01:18:48.032 --> 01:18:49.199
Didn't you tell him?

01:18:49.699 --> 01:18:52.501
Unpaid rent for three years.

01:18:52.532 --> 01:18:54.700
Food, clothing...etcetera.

01:18:54.766 --> 01:18:56.267
Women are expensive to maintain.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:57.233
Yeah.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:59.901
Fine. You don't have money, right?

01:19:01.532 --> 01:19:04.501
So...how about doing
me some favor too.

01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:07.601
Hey..
Just tell me the figures.

01:19:08.098 --> 01:19:10.266
4,332 rupees is the principal.

01:19:10.565 --> 01:19:12.500
You can add up the
interest on your own!

01:20:47.632 --> 01:20:49.100
lt happens.

01:20:50.599 --> 01:20:54.536
lt often happens.

01:20:56.665 --> 01:21:03.638
And then...l am not different
enough to escape this fate.

01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:08.134
l had to trust someone.

01:21:09.799 --> 01:21:11.033
Don't be sad.

01:21:14.832 --> 01:21:17.501
l didn't feel offended.

01:21:24.565 --> 01:21:26.099
l am also human after all.

01:21:27.098 --> 01:21:30.100
Shedding tears are normal.

01:21:51.899 --> 01:21:54.067
So much money...

01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:55.866
Where?

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:07.666
Shivy?

01:22:23.932 --> 01:22:27.068
Naru, where's Shashtri ji?

01:22:27.532 --> 01:22:31.002
He left in the morning
wearing his green English coat.

01:22:31.298 --> 01:22:32.399
l thought..

01:22:32.499 --> 01:22:36.836
'l will wear this the day
l take off in the air-plane# 

01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:41.002
'Or the day...l fly myself# 

01:22:46.665 --> 01:22:47.732
Kaka!

01:22:47.832 --> 01:22:49.600
Kaka!

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:33.599
Shasty ji?

01:24:36.732 --> 01:24:41.736
My friend, my guru, my teacher..

01:24:43.298 --> 01:24:46.634
He believed in me when
Even l didn't believe in myself.

01:24:48.632 --> 01:24:50.734
And do you know what l did?

01:24:51.799 --> 01:24:53.534
l shattered his faith.

01:24:54.932 --> 01:24:58.235
l stole his book which
was dearer to him than his life.

01:24:59.165 --> 01:25:00.900
And killed a man...

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:03.632
...who gave me my identity.

01:25:06.599 --> 01:25:08.334
l am a murderer.

01:25:08.932 --> 01:25:10.400
l am a murderer.

01:25:10.499 --> 01:25:12.467
l am a murderer.
l am a murderer.

01:25:12.499 --> 01:25:14.300
l am a murderer.

01:25:40.098 --> 01:25:41.466
Kaka.

01:25:42.866 --> 01:25:44.500
Why did you come here?

01:25:44.799 --> 01:25:46.267
Don't you know l am a thief?

01:25:46.365 --> 01:25:47.799
Go. Go home now!

01:25:50.799 --> 01:25:53.134
You did it for me, Shivy.

01:25:53.499 --> 01:25:56.602
l am the murderer, not you.

01:25:59.732 --> 01:26:01.767
What did you bring?
- Nothing.

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:03.734
What's written on that paper?

01:26:03.832 --> 01:26:05.600
That your uncle is a murderer.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.101
l brought offerings for you.

01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:17.402
And that will happen..

01:26:17.565 --> 01:26:22.403
..only when you fulfill
Shasty ji's dreams.

01:26:23.132 --> 01:26:26.435
Shasty Ji said,
''Never leave your uncle,

01:26:26.499 --> 01:26:28.534
Don't ever leave him''.

01:26:28.565 --> 01:26:30.566
''Am l your Shivy, right?''

01:26:39.065 --> 01:26:40.466
'l need you# 

01:26:40.532 --> 01:26:43.635
Shivy, you will have
to build the airplane.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:46.535
For me...for yourself.

01:26:47.599 --> 01:26:49.334
For Shasty ji.

01:26:49.399 --> 01:26:52.435
'At any cost,
you will have to do this# 

01:26:56.799 --> 01:27:01.470
Tell your uncle,
on 7th November at 9:24 am..

01:27:01.499 --> 01:27:04.134
..the winds will blow from the sea.

01:27:04.599 --> 01:27:06.233
The airplane shall fly.

01:27:14.065 --> 01:27:17.168
And this is my third condition.

01:27:21.032 --> 01:27:27.271
''From the hunter's clutches...''

01:27:29.432 --> 01:27:35.337
''Beyond the cage and its crutches''

01:27:35.365 --> 01:27:38.301
''From the hunter's clutches...''

01:27:38.365 --> 01:27:40.266
''Beyond the cage and its crutches''

01:27:40.298 --> 01:27:44.602
''He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky.''

01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:48.969
''He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky.''

01:27:49.065 --> 01:27:53.502
''Across the clouds, and fast
like the lightening, it will go high''

01:27:53.599 --> 01:28:00.672
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:28:02.098 --> 01:28:09.505
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:28:10.966 --> 01:28:18.173
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:28:19.499 --> 01:28:26.572
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:28:36.665 --> 01:28:43.271
'The day it's your turn to fly,
this coin will definitely fly alone# 

01:29:07.565 --> 01:29:13.504
''Sharpen your all your weapons.''

01:29:14.198 --> 01:29:18.902
''Sharpen your all your weapons.''

01:29:20.565 --> 01:29:22.500
''We'll live our dreams too.''

01:29:22.599 --> 01:29:25.068
''We'll shape it with hard work.''

01:29:25.165 --> 01:29:26.966
''We'll live our dreams too.''

01:29:27.032 --> 01:29:29.300
''We'll shape it with hard work.''

01:29:29.365 --> 01:29:35.137
''You're one in a million.''

01:29:38.065 --> 01:29:42.402
''You're one in a million.''

01:29:42.465 --> 01:29:49.271
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:29:51.232 --> 01:29:58.339
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:30:00.032 --> 01:30:06.872
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:30:08.565 --> 01:30:15.538
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:30:17.298 --> 01:30:24.938
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:30:51.065 --> 01:30:53.367
l am sure it's not gasoline.

01:30:57.365 --> 01:31:00.468
Out of money and no clue of the fuel.

01:31:01.065 --> 01:31:03.033
Whether l make this airplane or not..

01:31:03.098 --> 01:31:06.067
..But l will definitely
make a new record for failing.

01:31:09.866 --> 01:31:11.934
Are you asleep?

01:31:12.465 --> 01:31:14.233
With your glasses on?

01:31:14.265 --> 01:31:16.934
Dreams seem clearer.

01:31:19.232 --> 01:31:21.334
What are you thinking?

01:31:23.932 --> 01:31:25.199
Building a toy is one thing..

01:31:25.265 --> 01:31:28.401
..but building a real
airplane is different.

01:31:28.499 --> 01:31:30.834
And making it fly.

01:31:31.232 --> 01:31:32.166
What?

01:31:33.032 --> 01:31:34.366
l mean...a person will sit in it.

01:31:34.432 --> 01:31:36.100
So the weight will be double.

01:31:36.132 --> 01:31:38.467
How can gasoline make it fly?

01:31:38.532 --> 01:31:42.068
A mouse can run on peanuts,
but not an elephant.

01:31:42.465 --> 01:31:45.000
So...how will this fly?

01:31:45.932 --> 01:31:47.133
You don't know.

01:31:47.198 --> 01:31:49.767
But there must be someone..

01:31:50.065 --> 01:31:52.834
..who knows what fuel
will this plane use?

01:31:52.866 --> 01:31:54.267
You're correct.

01:31:54.532 --> 01:31:58.068
Shasty ji often
used to mention a name..

01:31:58.499 --> 01:31:59.967
Charu Saraswati!

01:32:28.132 --> 01:32:29.399
Charu Ji.

01:32:31.699 --> 01:32:32.699
Charu Ji.

01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:45.102
lf you want fuel, then you'll
have to answer my five questions..

01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:47.767
..in the opposite way.

01:32:47.866 --> 01:32:50.001
Not wrong, but opposite.

01:32:54.932 --> 01:32:59.436
lf you answer any question correctly,
l will leave.

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.433
First question?

01:33:01.699 --> 01:33:05.702
What's essential
for humans to survive?

01:33:05.732 --> 01:33:07.700
Air or water?

01:33:08.699 --> 01:33:09.866
Hope.

01:33:12.132 --> 01:33:15.001
What hurts the most?

01:33:15.265 --> 01:33:17.900
Lies or humiliation?

01:33:18.298 --> 01:33:19.832
Disloyalty.

01:33:20.265 --> 01:33:22.834
What is more frightful?

01:33:22.899 --> 01:33:25.234
Death or poverty?

01:33:26.132 --> 01:33:27.299
Failure!

01:33:31.165 --> 01:33:32.766
Your fifth question is?

01:33:32.799 --> 01:33:36.135
No, it's the fourth, not fifth?

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:40.201
You lost?
- How?

01:33:40.265 --> 01:33:41.966
You gave the right answer.

01:33:42.999 --> 01:33:45.801
This is cheating.
Absolutely unfair.

01:33:45.899 --> 01:33:49.836
Mr. Shasty respected you, and..
- You? Shivy?

01:33:50.632 --> 01:33:51.766
Shivy?

01:33:52.232 --> 01:33:54.801
Shasty had told me that
you will definitely come.

01:33:55.298 --> 01:33:59.335
He said you will unravel
the mysteries that he couldn't.

01:34:00.198 --> 01:34:02.633
l could never understand.

01:34:02.699 --> 01:34:07.303
Whether he loved you
or believed in you more.

01:34:08.899 --> 01:34:10.800
Are you his son?

01:34:11.032 --> 01:34:12.199
Yes.

01:34:12.399 --> 01:34:14.634
A useless son of a talented father.

01:34:18.632 --> 01:34:22.302
Even l don't know the solutions, son.

01:34:23.665 --> 01:34:28.069
The scriptures only have questions,
not answers.

01:34:28.132 --> 01:34:32.135
The answers lie within us.

01:34:32.932 --> 01:34:36.168
lt flows...but it's not water.

01:34:37.332 --> 01:34:40.101
lt shines...but it's not silver.

01:34:40.799 --> 01:34:44.936
4121 ...the fuel.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:49.601
Go...fly your airplane!

01:34:49.632 --> 01:34:51.000
Fly your airplane!

01:34:51.032 --> 01:34:54.802
Fly your airplane!
Go. Fly your airplane!

01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:56.700
Fly your airplane!

01:34:56.766 --> 01:34:57.833
Go.

01:35:03.899 --> 01:35:06.735
Kaka. Sitara Devi.

01:35:06.899 --> 01:35:08.900
Happy Dussera.
- Happy Dussera.

01:35:08.999 --> 01:35:11.034
So poor Ravan's been killed.

01:35:11.832 --> 01:35:14.000
Your Kaka doesn't know..

01:35:14.065 --> 01:35:17.301
..that Ravan is slain, not killed.

01:35:17.332 --> 01:35:18.866
Naru, hand me that hammer.

01:35:18.899 --> 01:35:21.601
No hammer, just gold.

01:35:21.665 --> 01:35:23.800
Happy Dussera.

01:35:26.699 --> 01:35:28.567
lt looks amazing, Kaka.

01:35:28.665 --> 01:35:30.867
Our airplane will look like this.

01:35:30.966 --> 01:35:33.535
Your Sitara Devi doesn't know..

01:35:33.599 --> 01:35:37.102
..one needs lots of
gold to build an airplane.

01:35:37.265 --> 01:35:39.667
The real one, not fake.

01:35:42.098 --> 01:35:43.899
You stole it?

01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:47.902
Sitara Devi, doesn't
your Shivy know..

01:35:47.999 --> 01:35:50.835
..taking something from
your own house, isn't stealing.

01:35:50.932 --> 01:35:53.100
l'll knock some sense into you.

01:35:53.132 --> 01:35:56.235
Shasty Ji's airplane won't
be built with filthy money.

01:35:56.766 --> 01:35:59.034
Then how will we build it, Kaka?

01:35:59.198 --> 01:36:03.735
Using some old parts...
and some old acquaintances!

01:36:05.699 --> 01:36:07.567
Hello.
l am Shivkar Talpade.

01:36:07.665 --> 01:36:09.199
Go on.
- And l am Narayan Talpade.

01:36:09.232 --> 01:36:11.233
We're about to build
the world's first airplane..

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:12.266
..and humans can fly in it.

01:36:12.565 --> 01:36:14.967
We politely request you
to lend us all the help you can.

01:36:15.065 --> 01:36:16.900
Come on.
- Oh yeah!

01:36:17.032 --> 01:36:18.233
Airplane.
- Yeah.

01:36:18.265 --> 01:36:20.567
Humans will fly!
- Yes.

01:36:22.065 --> 01:36:23.933
Go find someone else.

01:36:24.966 --> 01:36:25.966
Hello..

01:36:26.065 --> 01:36:27.833
l am Shivkar Talpade.
- And l am Narayan Talpade.

01:36:27.866 --> 01:36:31.069
We're about to build the world's first
airplane and humans can fly in it.

01:36:31.098 --> 01:36:31.998
Hello..

01:36:32.098 --> 01:36:33.165
l am Shivkar Talpade.

01:36:33.465 --> 01:36:34.899
Hello..
l am Shivkar Talpade.

01:36:34.999 --> 01:36:36.033
Wait..

01:36:36.098 --> 01:36:37.799
Wait..
- Aunty..

01:36:41.932 --> 01:36:43.800
Tying to cast a new spell or what?

01:36:45.899 --> 01:36:48.868
l have just a few days till 7th.

01:36:49.065 --> 01:36:51.934
lt's now...or never.

01:36:52.032 --> 01:36:54.000
What's so special with 7th November?

01:36:54.098 --> 01:36:55.999
Shasty ji's experience and knowledge.

01:36:56.032 --> 01:36:58.467
The day...the time...high-tide, low-tide..

01:36:58.565 --> 01:36:59.799
Speed of air, moisture...

01:36:59.866 --> 01:37:01.167
lt's not that easy
to understand all that.

01:37:01.432 --> 01:37:04.535
For that,
one needs to understand the universe.

01:37:04.632 --> 01:37:06.633
And Shasty ji was an expert at that.

01:37:06.665 --> 01:37:08.566
Not me!

01:37:08.999 --> 01:37:11.968
Building an airplane
is not my cup of tea.

01:37:12.032 --> 01:37:14.734
l don't know whether it is or not?

01:37:15.165 --> 01:37:17.800
But l've heard that a man in love..

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:22.001
..often does things beyond his limits.

01:37:27.532 --> 01:37:29.200
Don't expect anything anymore.

01:37:29.732 --> 01:37:32.000
Neither money or nor praise.

01:37:35.032 --> 01:37:37.401
Your airplane's has pricked
the eyes of the British.

01:37:37.432 --> 01:37:39.600
Come on, your highness,
the tiger's waiting.

01:37:39.699 --> 01:37:41.133
Just a minute, sir.

01:37:46.032 --> 01:37:49.101
l am an enslaved king
of an enslaved county.

01:37:49.899 --> 01:37:52.501
l've to hunt down the
tigers of my own jungle..

01:37:52.532 --> 01:37:56.369
..only for the sake
of their happiness.

01:37:59.732 --> 01:38:01.934
Not sure if histoy will forgive me...

01:38:02.932 --> 01:38:06.702
..but you please find
the heart to forgive me.

01:38:08.365 --> 01:38:09.733
Best of luck!

01:38:10.465 --> 01:38:16.838
''Bless me with your grace.''

01:38:18.799 --> 01:38:26.039
''You're my benefactor
on this journey.''

01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:35.373
''You can turn stones into diamonds.''

01:38:36.632 --> 01:38:38.333
Won't fly.

01:38:39.565 --> 01:38:41.533
Our airplane will never fly.

01:38:44.065 --> 01:38:45.833
Let's do one thing.

01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:47.533
Let's pick a chit.

01:39:07.065 --> 01:39:08.666
Shasty ji was right.

01:39:09.532 --> 01:39:11.500
Our fate's gone out for a stroll.

01:39:13.632 --> 01:39:16.601
Leave it. It will be the
opposite of what is written here.

01:39:16.632 --> 01:39:17.833
Shivy!

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:24.499
lt will fly!

01:39:25.732 --> 01:39:27.834
Which means l chose 'lt won't fly'.

01:39:29.298 --> 01:39:31.700
Our airplane will never fly.

01:39:33.232 --> 01:39:34.600
lt will.

01:39:36.365 --> 01:39:38.300
My dear friend,
since you build your airplane..

01:39:38.332 --> 01:39:40.367
..You forgot all
about your old friends.

01:39:42.332 --> 01:39:45.501
And l heard that...you're
building a big airplane.

01:39:45.599 --> 01:39:48.835
No, Khan Sahib. l tried my best.

01:39:49.298 --> 01:39:50.866
And now l've run out of
all my money and my courage.

01:39:50.932 --> 01:39:52.700
What are you saying?

01:39:52.799 --> 01:39:54.667
Then you will have
to come home with me.

01:39:54.766 --> 01:39:58.636
My 6 year old son keeps
telling his school friends..

01:39:58.732 --> 01:40:01.634
..that his father used to play
in the band with Shivkar Talpade.

01:40:01.665 --> 01:40:03.500
You're his hero.

01:40:03.599 --> 01:40:06.601
And l don't have the
courage to tell him..

01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:08.867
..that his hero's
Iost all his courage.

01:40:08.966 --> 01:40:10.734
You only tell him ifyou can.

01:40:10.766 --> 01:40:12.334
You don't know, but..

01:40:12.432 --> 01:40:16.235
..you're the only free Indian
of this enslaved county. Only one.

01:40:16.298 --> 01:40:18.800
You're the one who
gives us courage, hope.

01:40:18.866 --> 01:40:21.301
Of an independent tomorrow.

01:40:21.365 --> 01:40:26.803
You will have to fly. For us.

01:40:27.265 --> 01:40:29.567
For the workers that
toil in the mills.

01:40:29.632 --> 01:40:31.000
The labors that build bridges.

01:40:31.298 --> 01:40:33.233
For the arms that pull the rickshaw.

01:40:33.265 --> 01:40:35.834
For we Indians...you will have to fly.

01:40:35.899 --> 01:40:39.902
How, Khan Sir? This is all l have.

01:40:41.265 --> 01:40:45.302
Will the airplane fly with this?
- It will.

01:40:47.232 --> 01:40:49.867
Your airplane will definitely fly.

01:40:49.999 --> 01:40:51.734
Look.

01:40:51.832 --> 01:40:55.835
The entire neighbourhood
saved this...for Haj.

01:40:56.632 --> 01:40:59.401
Go fly your airplane.

01:40:59.632 --> 01:41:02.935
We'll consider our Haj done.

01:41:03.365 --> 01:41:06.434
And if that's not enough,
then take this too.

01:41:07.265 --> 01:41:10.401
We poor people have a big heart.

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:14.968
Will you fly your airplane now?
- Of course he will.

01:41:15.665 --> 01:41:16.932
Want to bet 50 paise on it?

01:41:17.232 --> 01:41:19.567
Atleast now raise your
standard to a rupee bet.

01:41:29.365 --> 01:41:31.500
''Your prayers...''

01:41:31.532 --> 01:41:33.667
''Your prayers...''

01:41:33.732 --> 01:41:35.834
''Your prayers...''

01:41:35.899 --> 01:41:38.234
''Your prayers...''

01:41:38.332 --> 01:41:42.536
''l bowed,
l kneeled...l even prayed secretly.''

01:41:42.632 --> 01:41:47.169
''l bowed,
l kneeled...l even prayed secretly.''

01:41:47.198 --> 01:41:49.400
''l stopped and prayed.''

01:41:49.499 --> 01:41:51.734
''l knelt and prayed.''

01:41:51.799 --> 01:41:56.403
''The nomad in me has
surrendered to you...''

01:41:56.432 --> 01:42:00.702
''The nomad in me has
surrendered to you...''

01:42:00.732 --> 01:42:02.867
''No sense of dying.''

01:42:02.899 --> 01:42:05.268
''No sense of dying.''

01:42:05.332 --> 01:42:09.669
''No sense of dying...nor of living.''

01:42:09.766 --> 01:42:15.738
''The nomad in me has
surrendered to you...''

01:42:26.799 --> 01:42:31.170
''With hope carved on my tools...''

01:42:31.265 --> 01:42:35.602
''With hope carved on my tools...''

01:42:36.132 --> 01:42:38.234
''l have put parts
of my dreams onto it...''

01:42:38.332 --> 01:42:40.867
''l have put parts
of my dreams onto it...''

01:42:42.298 --> 01:42:46.669
''This simple wood needs
to travel the world...''

01:42:46.766 --> 01:42:51.303
''This simple wood needs''
to travel the world...

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:53.367
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:42:53.465 --> 01:42:55.600
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:42:55.632 --> 01:42:57.767
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:42:57.832 --> 01:43:00.334
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:43:00.399 --> 01:43:02.467
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:43:02.532 --> 01:43:04.834
''Now these wings cannot be stopped.''

01:43:04.866 --> 01:43:13.541
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:13.799 --> 01:43:21.306
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:22.665 --> 01:43:30.472
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:31.465 --> 01:43:39.139
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:40.365 --> 01:43:48.639
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:49.365 --> 01:43:55.771
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:05.305
''The swan will fly away alone...''

01:44:12.265 --> 01:44:13.633
Accounts! Accounts! Accounts!

01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:15.333
l need to finish these accounts today.

01:44:15.432 --> 01:44:17.534
Gokhle. Where's Gokhle?

01:44:17.565 --> 01:44:19.133
Gokhle.

01:44:19.532 --> 01:44:21.500
Godbole..

01:44:25.499 --> 01:44:26.566
Narayan!

01:44:27.198 --> 01:44:28.265
Narayan!

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:32.366
What's this?

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.133
What's this?

01:44:34.165 --> 01:44:37.601
Look, Narayan...no airplane
can fly without fuel.

01:44:38.165 --> 01:44:40.066
Your uncle is crazy.

01:44:40.132 --> 01:44:43.969
And you're even
crazier to believe him.

01:44:44.465 --> 01:44:45.699
You might be crazy.

01:44:45.732 --> 01:44:47.700
My uncle is not crazy.

01:44:47.732 --> 01:44:49.700
He's not!
My uncle is not crazy.

01:44:49.966 --> 01:44:51.600
Narayan!

01:44:53.032 --> 01:44:55.033
Forget it, Mohan.

01:44:55.565 --> 01:44:57.366
He's just a kid.

01:44:57.432 --> 01:44:58.666
No, father.

01:44:59.265 --> 01:45:02.067
You can live without your son..

01:45:04.198 --> 01:45:05.999
But not me.

01:45:06.732 --> 01:45:08.533
l can't live without him.

01:45:09.399 --> 01:45:11.334
l can't live without him.

01:45:17.298 --> 01:45:19.133
You want promotion, don't you?

01:45:22.032 --> 01:45:23.233
Promotion?

01:45:24.365 --> 01:45:26.400
l have a piece of information.

01:45:37.332 --> 01:45:41.636
Naru...l know what's 4121 ..

01:45:41.665 --> 01:45:43.199
True

01:45:43.432 --> 01:45:45.267
F for four F for fodder.

01:45:45.899 --> 01:45:49.235
1 plus 2 makes 12.
An animal with 12 horns.

01:45:49.265 --> 01:45:58.207
When the animal would eat this fodder,
he will poop put the fuel.

01:45:59.132 --> 01:46:02.268
Kaka, eveything's a joke for you.

01:46:06.132 --> 01:46:08.934
Narayan,
no matter what you do in life..

01:46:09.032 --> 01:46:10.333
Be a Doctor, Lamer..

01:46:10.432 --> 01:46:13.101
..Collector...anything.

01:46:13.198 --> 01:46:14.532
But don't ever cy.

01:46:14.565 --> 01:46:16.433
You know why?

01:46:16.999 --> 01:46:20.302
Cying doesn't change anything.

01:46:20.365 --> 01:46:24.001
Look at me.
The teacher chucked me out..

01:46:24.365 --> 01:46:26.133
..and l left with a smile.

01:46:26.165 --> 01:46:29.268
l found Sitara...and l smiled.

01:46:30.032 --> 01:46:33.568
Father threw me out of the house,
and l still smiled.

01:46:34.098 --> 01:46:36.099
Shasty ji said ''Let's fly''..

01:46:36.132 --> 01:46:37.233
..and l still smiled.

01:46:37.265 --> 01:46:39.533
l even built an airplane. Smiled.

01:46:39.832 --> 01:46:42.334
There was just one
time l didn't smile.

01:46:43.832 --> 01:46:45.600
When Shasty ji passed away.

01:46:47.966 --> 01:46:49.534
l cried.

01:46:50.966 --> 01:46:54.402
But...did that change a thing?

01:46:57.265 --> 01:46:59.433
That's why l say...smile!

01:46:59.465 --> 01:47:00.999
Laugh aloud..
- Uncle..

01:47:01.032 --> 01:47:02.199
Laugh!

01:47:02.232 --> 01:47:03.600
Uncle..
- Come.

01:47:03.832 --> 01:47:07.168
But Kaka, fuel?
- We'll figure something out.

01:47:07.265 --> 01:47:08.399
Uncle, we have just two days.

01:47:08.499 --> 01:47:09.466
Come on.

01:47:10.032 --> 01:47:15.971
Children, this is our Solar Sysem.

01:47:16.032 --> 01:47:18.534
What is it called?
- Solar System.

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:19.465
Vey good.

01:47:19.532 --> 01:47:22.501
ln the centre we have the Sun.

01:47:22.599 --> 01:47:27.303
And the first planet...
is called Mercuy, which is..

01:47:27.332 --> 01:47:29.767
Different names in
Physics and Chemisty.

01:47:30.332 --> 01:47:32.233
Physics and Chemisty?

01:47:32.332 --> 01:47:34.000
Who's this learned chap?

01:47:34.098 --> 01:47:35.766
Me Shivkar Govind Talpade.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:40.370
An old scholar of your class.
- So...it's you.

01:47:41.198 --> 01:47:42.966
So the plane flew?

01:47:42.999 --> 01:47:45.801
Class 4...8 times fail.

01:47:46.866 --> 01:47:49.468
He'll fly an airplane...
build a flying ship.

01:47:49.866 --> 01:47:52.001
Young man, if you're that smart..

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:54.534
..then why don't you
explain this to the kids?

01:47:58.165 --> 01:47:59.933
Come.

01:48:00.799 --> 01:48:02.066
Here.

01:48:02.165 --> 01:48:03.933
Mercuy.

01:48:04.165 --> 01:48:09.904
'Buddh' in Physics and,
in Chemisty.. - Uncle.

01:48:09.999 --> 01:48:13.369
You see 4121 eveywhere.

01:48:13.432 --> 01:48:17.068
Naru...this isn't 4121 ... it's..

01:48:22.165 --> 01:48:25.501
Oh yes, Para (Mercuy)
in hindi looks like 4121 .

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:27.467
We just needed to add on top line.

01:48:27.499 --> 01:48:29.701
We found the fuel.

01:48:29.799 --> 01:48:32.201
Kaka, it shines..
- But it's not silver.

01:48:32.298 --> 01:48:33.966
lt flows.. - But not water.

01:48:34.065 --> 01:48:36.367
The mixture of metal
and chemical, mercuy.

01:48:36.465 --> 01:48:39.167
Will our airplane fly now?
- Of course.

01:48:39.198 --> 01:48:41.967
No it won't.
Don't move.

01:48:42.932 --> 01:48:45.234
But why?
- You're under arrest.

01:48:46.332 --> 01:48:47.933
Kaka..

01:49:16.732 --> 01:49:18.900
Don't wory...the airplane will fly.

01:49:18.999 --> 01:49:21.000
You will find mercuy
in the thermometer.

01:49:21.032 --> 01:49:22.933
Thermometer.

01:49:52.832 --> 01:49:54.934
l heard, but l couldn't believe it.

01:49:54.999 --> 01:49:56.100
What?

01:49:56.899 --> 01:49:58.834
That someone flew an airplane..

01:49:58.899 --> 01:50:00.767
..or that your useless
son flew an airplane.

01:50:00.799 --> 01:50:05.870
Although it's late,
but l still came to congratulate you.

01:50:08.198 --> 01:50:10.366
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

01:50:10.766 --> 01:50:13.902
Do you know why l made it this far?

01:50:14.332 --> 01:50:15.633
Because of you.

01:50:16.298 --> 01:50:18.299
For l am like you.

01:50:18.832 --> 01:50:21.000
Headstrong!

01:50:33.365 --> 01:50:37.669
Would you like to say
something in your defense?

01:50:37.732 --> 01:50:39.733
Your Honor, there's just one thing..

01:50:39.832 --> 01:50:42.668
..l want to say to your Britishers.

01:50:43.732 --> 01:50:44.933
Thank you.

01:50:45.298 --> 01:50:47.667
Thank you for arresting me.

01:50:47.866 --> 01:50:50.201
Thank you for bringing me here.

01:50:50.399 --> 01:50:52.400
And thank you for filing
this case against me.

01:50:52.665 --> 01:50:53.832
Because if you hadn't done this..

01:50:53.932 --> 01:50:55.900
..l wouldn't have
reached out to my people.

01:50:56.899 --> 01:51:00.202
Thank you...for bringing me close...

01:51:01.799 --> 01:51:02.966
...to my people.

01:51:03.732 --> 01:51:06.701
Flying an airplane
seemed like a faiytale.

01:51:06.766 --> 01:51:08.334
l had lost all hope.

01:51:08.832 --> 01:51:11.634
But today,
after seeing all these people..

01:51:11.665 --> 01:51:13.733
..l've made up my mind.

01:51:13.766 --> 01:51:15.167
Humans will fly.

01:51:16.799 --> 01:51:23.272
So thank you...for mending
my broken courage.

01:51:23.932 --> 01:51:27.969
Friends, there's just
one thing l want to say to you.

01:51:28.298 --> 01:51:30.033
These Britishers
can steal our slumber..

01:51:30.132 --> 01:51:32.901
..but not our dreams.

01:51:33.766 --> 01:51:36.034
When l fly my airplane, and..

01:51:36.832 --> 01:51:42.771
..you will hear just one
voice in the engine's rattle.

01:51:45.032 --> 01:51:46.833
Vande Mataram!

01:51:52.165 --> 01:51:57.169
Sir...l am no freedom fighter.

01:51:58.232 --> 01:52:02.936
But...for giving me the opportunity..

01:52:03.198 --> 01:52:07.669
..to say Vande Mataram
in front of all my people..

01:52:07.699 --> 01:52:08.833
Thank you!

01:52:08.899 --> 01:52:10.667
Vande Mataram!

01:52:10.766 --> 01:52:12.968
Vande Mataram!

01:52:43.665 --> 01:52:50.004
Friend...our paths maybe separate,
but our destination is the same.

01:52:50.165 --> 01:52:51.633
Freedom.

01:52:51.799 --> 01:52:54.535
Tomorrow, eveyone will hear
just one voice in engine's rattle.

01:52:54.899 --> 01:52:57.034
'We're free# 

01:52:58.098 --> 01:52:59.599
Vande Mataram!

01:53:24.098 --> 01:53:28.135
Tonight's the last night,
tomorrow the final goodbye.

01:53:28.532 --> 01:53:30.166
Without me?

01:53:30.432 --> 01:53:31.900
lt's suicide.

01:53:32.098 --> 01:53:34.900
l don't know how to stop,
turn or land.

01:53:35.465 --> 01:53:37.800
lt's an unsolvable maze.

01:53:37.866 --> 01:53:39.534
So why don't you just jump down?

01:53:39.565 --> 01:53:40.999
Death in any case.

01:53:43.432 --> 01:53:46.568
l am already burdened
for murdering Mr. Shasty.

01:53:46.632 --> 01:53:47.799
Don't want to be
responsible for yours.

01:53:47.866 --> 01:53:49.434
You fulfilled my
third condition..

01:53:49.532 --> 01:53:51.800
...and now you don't
want your reward?

01:53:52.499 --> 01:53:54.901
l know you want me to come with you.

01:53:54.999 --> 01:53:57.935
No, l don't want you to come.

01:53:58.032 --> 01:54:00.567
You want it.
- No.

01:54:00.966 --> 01:54:05.503
lf you didn't...then why
would you put two chairs in it?

01:54:05.966 --> 01:54:10.570
Because...l..
- Yes..

01:54:13.499 --> 01:54:15.133
Speak up.

01:54:16.832 --> 01:54:18.500
No reason!

01:54:24.165 --> 01:54:26.901
Kaka...say cheese!

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:34.533
Hey our Nemon.

01:54:34.632 --> 01:54:35.966
Will that Chatterjee
from the police station..

01:54:35.999 --> 01:54:37.767
..come down to click our picture?

01:54:37.799 --> 01:54:40.768
lt's automatic, uncle.
- How?

01:54:41.098 --> 01:54:47.370
Well, l've put in a small
piece of cotton in the camera.

01:54:47.399 --> 01:54:49.367
And poured two drops of water.

01:54:49.432 --> 01:54:51.367
As soon as the cotton gets wet,
it will go heavier..

01:54:51.432 --> 01:54:52.800
..the button will get
pressed automatically.

01:54:52.899 --> 01:54:54.867
And take our picture.

01:54:54.899 --> 01:54:56.500
Look ahead.

01:54:58.932 --> 01:55:01.934
Kaka, what's inside?
- Letters, for my mother.

01:55:01.999 --> 01:55:05.435
Tomorrow,
at 9:24 am your Kaka will fly away.

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:06.432
Don't stay asleep.

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:09.001
Narayan...your father's
furious, hury up.

01:55:09.065 --> 01:55:11.901
Mother, l'll be there, you go.
- Come on.

01:55:11.966 --> 01:55:13.767
Sister-in-law.

01:55:20.432 --> 01:55:22.567
Are you really going tomorrow?

01:55:25.065 --> 01:55:27.434
You will never come back?

01:55:30.298 --> 01:55:31.866
Good for you.

01:55:32.532 --> 01:55:34.867
At least you will be free.

01:55:35.365 --> 01:55:37.033
Don't wory about Narayan.

01:55:37.365 --> 01:55:39.333
l'll appoint a tutor for him.

01:55:40.932 --> 01:55:44.869
l'll take care of mother, father...

01:55:45.866 --> 01:55:47.567
You just go.

01:55:49.932 --> 01:55:51.633
Choose one.

01:55:53.399 --> 01:55:54.700
Come on choose.

01:55:57.732 --> 01:55:59.333
Stupid!

01:55:59.799 --> 01:56:01.467
You lost again.

01:56:03.465 --> 01:56:05.633
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

01:56:06.799 --> 01:56:08.967
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

01:56:09.565 --> 01:56:11.300
Don't lose tomorrow.

01:56:13.899 --> 01:56:16.468
Make India proud!

01:56:30.665 --> 01:56:34.935
'l will wear this the
day...l take off in an airplane# 

01:56:36.732 --> 01:56:43.538
''With a bag full of memories...''

01:56:43.632 --> 01:56:49.771
''And a trunk stuffed with love...''

01:56:50.565 --> 01:56:57.538
''Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened...''

01:56:57.565 --> 01:57:04.438
''Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened...''

01:57:04.465 --> 01:57:10.704
''Time to go kiss the moon.''

01:57:10.732 --> 01:57:23.444
''The swan will fly away alone..''

01:57:24.432 --> 01:57:36.644
''The swan will fly away alone..''

01:58:01.165 --> 01:58:02.499
Go.

01:58:06.365 --> 01:58:08.834
Go quietly.

01:58:18.565 --> 01:58:20.500
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

01:58:20.532 --> 01:58:23.635
l told you not to.
- But, father..

01:58:23.832 --> 01:58:26.668
You won't listen, will you?

01:58:27.165 --> 01:58:28.699
You won't listen...

01:58:31.599 --> 01:58:33.767
Dawn comes eveyday..

01:58:34.432 --> 01:58:36.500
..but airplanes don't fly evey day.

01:58:37.499 --> 01:58:40.301
You will definitely go watch
the airplane fly today, Narayan.

01:58:40.399 --> 01:58:41.433
Go.

01:58:43.532 --> 01:58:45.166
Let go!

01:58:53.565 --> 01:58:55.767
We shall salute you rather.

01:58:55.832 --> 01:59:01.304
My dear friend, before you
become the world's first flying man.

01:59:01.399 --> 01:59:06.137
Won't you give me an autograph?

01:59:10.432 --> 01:59:11.733
Memorabilia!

01:59:15.365 --> 01:59:16.766
Sir. Sir!

01:59:16.832 --> 01:59:18.700
Shiv's escaped.
He's escaped from jail.

01:59:18.732 --> 01:59:20.333
