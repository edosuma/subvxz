WEBVTT

00:02.880 --> 00:05.840
A rowan tree...
A crossing between worlds.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.480
I'm a demon, but I was
born of witches.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.920
If our baby is a witch
born of demons,

00:11.080 --> 00:14.080
she'll be everything the congregation
fears and wants to destroy.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.680
Has anyone in this chamber
heard of the Knights of Lazarus?

00:16.840 --> 00:20.280
They were established by Philippe
de Clermont and his sons.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.320
The brotherhood is philanthropic.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.120
We protect those who
can't protect themselves.

00:24.280 --> 00:28.160
Grand Master of the Knights
of Lazarus? I can't do this.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.480
-I don't want to.
-Philippe, let me promise you

00:30.640 --> 00:33.640
that the Brotherhood would
never be run by Baldwin.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.480
And I'm asking you
to do that.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.480
<i>It looked like an uncontrolled feeding.</i>

00:38.640 --> 00:40.600
I haven't seen anything
like that in centuries.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.080
And we do all
know the rumors

00:42.240 --> 00:44.520
about the de Clermont's
infected bloodline.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.400
You need to have
more than suspicions.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.040
You need to be sure.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.720
This page is connected to Diana.
They must have answers for us.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.480
That book started
this whole nightmare.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.880
I'm tolerating them under my roof
and affording them my protection.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.880
Matthew would want you
to make them feel at home.

01:00.040 --> 01:03.080
My father commands me
to return to Centaur.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.560
You're the bravest boy I know.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.520
You'll look after them
until we get back.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.480
Sir.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.560
Yeah.
It's happened again.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.840
I never knew that.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.040
Just around the corner, apparently.
In broad daylight.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.480
Really?
That's terrible.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.120
-Good morning.
-Hi, how can I help?

04:36.280 --> 04:39.160
I am interested in
one of your lots.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.400
I'm afraid our managers are fully
booked until 11:00.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.760
Ah, no, no. It's all right.
I'll take him through.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.240
Phoebe Taylor.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.160
Marcus Whitmore.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.400
Cold hands, sorry.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.120
My office is this way.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.440
-What's on the headphones?
-Podcast on radiocarbon dating.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.800
Ah, cool.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.200
New Order.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.960
Never heard of them.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.600
Which lot are you
interested in?

05:18.040 --> 05:19.840
42.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.960
The answer to life,
the universe and everything.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.760
-Douglas Adams.
-I love those books.

05:27.920 --> 05:32.960
Right. Let's see, lot 42.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.080
Right. What would
you like to know?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.200
I would like to buy it.

05:38.360 --> 05:42.000
Our auction lots aren't
available for advance purchase.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.840
Well, the auction estimate
is Â£80,000.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.320
So, do you think 200
grand might do it?

05:50.480 --> 05:55.840
That's well in excess
of our evaluation.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.400
My grandmother has really
set her heart on these.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.680
I'm afraid that you'll have
to bid for it this afternoon.

06:06.760 --> 06:11.320
Look, if it was up to me, for 200,

06:11.480 --> 06:13.520
I'd let you take it.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.480
Why aren't you
in charge here?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.760
You should definitely
be in charge here.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.600
Well, I'm working on it.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.200
Would you like to see it?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.760
Lot 42.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.840
That's the one.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.200
Martha's nut loaf is incredible.
Seriously, she's a keeper.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.760
You need to see this.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.080
As Grand Master of
the Knights of Lazarus,

06:59.240 --> 07:01.800
Marcus had Nathaniel
monitor the internet

07:01.960 --> 07:04.880
for any evidence of Matthew
and Diana in the past.

07:05.040 --> 07:09.680
He found these at an
auction house in Oxford.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.120
Painted in the late
16th century.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.040
It's them.
They made it.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.760
Marcus is purchasing
the portraits this afternoon.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.720
Any further bids for this pair
of Elizabethan miniatures?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.440
And it's against you, madam.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.920
And it's there,
at 94,000.

07:29.080 --> 07:33.520
Last call at 94,000. Sold.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.080
You just saved your
grandmother a fortune.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.160
Hope she appreciates it.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.560
They say I can't collect
them till tomorrow.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.600
You couldn't pull a few
strings, could you?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.080
I can pay cash.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.280
I'm sorry. We don't accept cash.

07:55.440 --> 08:00.280
The items have to return to the
vaults until your payment clears.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.760
I was heading
to France tonight.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.280
But I suppose
I'll have to delay.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.640
Whatever will I do
with my free evening?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.120
I don't know.

08:16.280 --> 08:20.040
Maybe stream some more
old man dance music.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.720
You Googled New Order?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.680
Nice doing business.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.960
Hi.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.960
One of the Madison
Coven finally cracked.

08:56.120 --> 09:01.320
She confirmed that there were demons
and vampires at the Bishop house.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.560
With Matthew and the witches.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.840
Before Matthew
disappeared into time,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.800
he formed his own cabal.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.720
Three different species
working together in secret.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.360
Another de Clermont conspiracy.
What the hell is he up to?

09:16.520 --> 09:21.080
Whatever it is, it involves
the Book of Life.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.560
Matthew and Diana
are so far ahead of us.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.480
We need to pool our resources
if we're going to stop him.

09:33.120 --> 09:38.120
Some of this information dates
back to the 13th century.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.800
It's everything I know.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.480
about the Book of Life.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.240
Baldwin owes me a debt.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.880
If your whereabouts become
known, he'll let us know.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.080
Don't worry. Once the baby's born,
we promise we'll be out of your hair.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.440
It's been great having you here.
You can stay as long as you like.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.320
You're safer here with
Marcus than back in Chepstow.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.680
If the baby does
turn out to be a witch,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.760
you're gonna need protection
from the congregation.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.520
Screw the congregation.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.160
Aren't we breaking the covenant
already by living with a vampire?

10:13.320 --> 10:16.840
Demons giving birth to
witches would be unheard of.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.720
Sophie's birth may
have gone unnoticed,

10:18.880 --> 10:22.360
but the granddaughter of a
congregation member will not.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.200
They'll take her from you.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.640
Or worse. Especially Knox
and the other conservatives.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.800
-Marcus?
-Yep. Coming.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.360
Your DNA should help us determine the
levels of witch and demon in your blood.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.280
Her DNA might even help us understand
why creature genetics are changing.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.480
You can have whatever you need.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.120
-Thanks.
-Hey.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.400
-Hey. Can you take a look at this?
-Yeah.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.920
Is everything all right?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.240
Yeah. I just need him
to check something.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.480
Fetal arrhythmia.

10:56.640 --> 11:01.320
There's just a slight abnormality
with the baby's heart rate.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.880
She's just a little slow.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.360
It's a temporary thing, and in most
cases, resolved pretty quickly.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.160
-Okay.
-We can't risk a home birth.

11:10.320 --> 11:14.000
Miriam's right.
She's gonna be fine. Don't worry,

11:14.160 --> 11:16.800
but you two should probably start
thinking about having her in a hospital.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.200
But we planned to be here,
for you to do it.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.320
To avoid attention.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.800
I'll find you the best in
the business. I promise.

11:25.960 --> 11:29.240
It's just better to be
somewhere with specialist care.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.600
Sorry, but the plan
needs to change.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.520
I hear you, but the congregation
have spies everywhere.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.800
It's a risk worth taking.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.160
Is this another one?

12:11.320 --> 12:13.800
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>There was an attack this morning.</i>

12:13.960 --> 12:17.320
The body's been eviscerated,
just like the others.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.440
Any idea who's responsible?

12:19.600 --> 12:22.520
<i>Nothing to implicate</i>
<i>the de Clermonts yet.</i>

12:22.680 --> 12:27.720
<i>I don't recognize the scent,</i>
<i>but I was right about the wounds.</i>

12:30.120 --> 12:33.640
-Blood-rage is back.
<i>-Track the scent. Find the killer.</i>

12:33.800 --> 12:35.760
<i>There has to be a link.</i>

13:08.040 --> 13:10.240
-Security!
-Stop right there!

13:43.160 --> 13:44.600
Why wasn't
the alarm tripped?

13:44.760 --> 13:46.800
The power's
been disabled.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.080
Alarms, CCTV, everything.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.240
Joe Evans was on duty,
but we can't get hold of him.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.680
Our vault door was ripped open.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.520
Were any other lots stolen?

14:02.680 --> 14:07.800
We're doing an inventory, but at
first glance, I don't think so.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.680
Obviously, your deposit
will be refunded.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.720
Do the police have a suspect?

14:11.880 --> 14:14.960
Our security guard
has vanished.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.800
That's all I know.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.800
I'm really sorry.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.640
I should really call
my grandmother.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.960
<i>It's Peter Knox.</i>
<i>Someone who works for him.</i>

14:29.120 --> 14:31.640
Do you have any contacts
in the Oxford covens?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.120
<i>We'll have to ask around.</i>

14:33.280 --> 14:34.760
Be a lot easier if we
could just go there.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.560
-I know.
-You can't leave the chateau.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.400
We're grown women.
We can look after ourselves.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.960
I promised to keep you safe.
So that's what I'm doing.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.800
Who is it?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.560
Gerbert wants to meet.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.080
Maybe he has a hold
of the miniatures.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.760
He could have eyes
on the chateau already.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.000
From now on,
you need to stay inside.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.680
Might as well be prisoners,
confined to ourselves.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.440
Stay here much longer,
I might hurl myself out of a tower.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.440
You could find out
what's inside that book

15:16.600 --> 15:18.280
and why it's connected to Diana.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.120
We'll be doing something productive.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.720
How do we do that exactly?
We only have one page.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.560
We need to connect
with someone who did.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.440
We know Stephen did.
Maybe Rebecca did, too.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.800
If you're proposing to summon
the dead, forget about it.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.520
Don't you wanna help Diana?

15:36.680 --> 15:39.520
Do you remember what happened the
last time you got into higher magic?

15:39.680 --> 15:41.560
I'm much more
experienced now.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.680
Just a little out of practice.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.520
Oh, my God.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.680
You've already tried.
I mean, just a tiny experiment.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.440
I just want to see if I
could connect with something.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.360
Emily, you can't
do this to me.

15:57.520 --> 16:01.640
Listen, when Diana returns,
she'll have come into her magic.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.920
She'll be able to call up
the book herself.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.440
You don't know that.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.000
Swear to me you
won't do it again.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.680
I knew you were
gonna react this way.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.400
-Swear to me!
-Okay! Okay.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.280
Look, honey.
All right. Mwah!

16:14.440 --> 16:15.880
Whatever you want.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.840
I just want you to be safe.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.960
Did you break the news
to your grandmother?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.680
So, is there anything else
I can help you with?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.840
You could come to dinner.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.080
I don't even know you.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.160
Come on.
I don't bite.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.320
-Oh, thank you.
-Thanks.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.520
I did a lot of research on
those portraits,

17:32.680 --> 17:35.320
but could never pin
their exact origin down.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.080
Well, we think that

17:37.240 --> 17:39.680
they belonged to our
family a long time ago.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.040
-The Whitmores?
-De Clermonts.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.440
My grandmother's French, but I'm
actually originally American.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.360
A revolutionary.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.800
Seeing Hamilton a couple of times
doesn't make you a revolutionary.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.720
-What about six times?
-Oh, wow.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.440
-You must really love musical theater.
-Yeah.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.400
I just love history.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.480
Even if they do get it
wrong sometimes.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.440
Well, getting it right
is what I do for a living.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.840
I'm usually alone at weekends,
cataloging artwork.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.400
My friends think I'm weird.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.480
I like weird.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.760
I'm sorry. I promised my grandmother

18:28.920 --> 18:30.880
that I would give her
a call before we ate.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.080
-Do you mind?
-No, no, I'll just... talk to my gin.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.720
Yeah, I'll be quick.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.400
Wherever there's trouble,
there's a de Clermont.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.440
What were you doing
at the auction house?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.800
I'll ask you
the same question.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.520
Okay. First off,
you're not really my type.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.640
And, secondly, you could
really do with a breath mint.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.880
You have no idea what's
happening in this city, do you?

19:13.480 --> 19:16.920
-So, tell me.
-A vampire's murdering warm bloods.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.560
Yesterday morning,
a man was killed on his way to work.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.320
Then, last night, a guard of the
auction house was ripped to shreds.

19:23.480 --> 19:27.800
I caught the killer's scent, tracked it
inside. I found the guard in the vaults.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.920
I had to clean up the mess
before the police found out.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.680
-Did you take anything?
-Oh, sure.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.840
I was up to a few Rembrandts.
This is serious, Marcus.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.040
Whoever's doing this
is infected with blood rage.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.880
My grandfather eliminated
blood rage centuries ago.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.520
Apparently not.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.920
If this keeps happening,
we'll be exposed to the humans.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.600
You know what that means?

19:59.760 --> 20:03.800
You hear anything,
you see anything, come find me.

20:05.960 --> 20:10.120
Make sure your date doesn't
start asking questions

20:10.280 --> 20:12.320
about the missing guard.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.800
<i>-What's up? I'm off-duty.</i>
-I need you to find out

20:31.960 --> 20:35.520
if anything was stolen from
the auction house last night.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.240
Oh, you better catch up.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.440
-Yeah.
-How was she?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.840
She's still pretty upset.

20:53.600 --> 21:00.200
I'm not supposed to say, but the
police, they think it's an inside job.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.760
They're still looking
for our security guard, Joe.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.160
I just can't imagine him stealing.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.320
Also, why take two miniature portraits

21:09.480 --> 21:11.440
when there are works of art
worth millions?

21:11.600 --> 21:14.320
-We should probably order.
-None of this makes sense.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.240
There must be more to this.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.000
Did your grandmother
know who the sitters were?

21:19.160 --> 21:22.280
Were the portraits undervalued?
Is that why she was so set on them?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.560
We should probably just let
the police do their job.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.760
There's nothing we
can do about it now.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.320
So, is hot and cold
your thing, is it?

21:40.920 --> 21:42.400
I'm sorry.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.880
The conversation with my grandmother
just really wound me up.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.160
It's not you, honestly.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.800
I can't believe you
don't like 80s music.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.640
Some of the best music ever
was made in the 80s.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.920
You know, I could see you
in a Duran Duran video.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.520
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you've got the hair for it.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.640
The fact that you're owning
your terrible taste in music

22:14.800 --> 22:17.040
is kind of attractive.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.560
Kind of?

22:18.720 --> 22:22.960
But I feel like you're
holding out on me.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.360
You don't like talking
about yourself, do you?

22:29.760 --> 22:33.880
My life is
pretty complicated.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.880
I'm not usually
this forward...

22:50.600 --> 22:52.520
Good night.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.880
Bye.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.560
Have you decided where you're
gonna have the baby yet?

23:16.720 --> 23:19.960
Yeah. We're gonna
go with your hospital.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.440
It's the safest option.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.840
The obstetrician works out there
anyway, so it makes sense.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.800
I mean, she thinks
the baby's fine.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.360
What kind of world
are we bringing her into?

23:34.520 --> 23:37.440
I mean, how could she
even stand a chance?

23:37.600 --> 23:40.200
If she is a witch,
she'll represent everything

23:40.360 --> 23:42.160
the congregation stands against.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.680
She'll be in danger.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.320
She's got you two for parents.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.400
And the Knights of Lazarus
to protect her.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.280
And, who knows,
maybe others like her

23:52.200 --> 23:54.640
-I'm serious.
-Mate, I don't wanna be down

23:54.800 --> 23:56.560
on your whole Grand Master
thing, but come on.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.080
The Knights protect those
who can't protect themselves.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.560
Yeah, but there's loads of bad
stuff going on in the world.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.480
Wars, famine, refugees.
I don't see the Knights.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.520
I mean, what are they
doing, bake sales?

24:06.680 --> 24:09.120
-I know what they're capable of.
-Maybe hundreds of years ago.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.880
But now...

24:12.040 --> 24:14.320
they need a rebrand, mate.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.000
And you have got
your work cut out for you.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.200
Mm. Night.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.640
-Hi.
-You know you're a mystery,

24:44.800 --> 24:47.520
and I hate mysteries.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.680
For you.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.240
So, full disclosure,

24:56.400 --> 25:01.560
I may have looked you up online,
and you're invisible.

25:01.720 --> 25:06.600
I mean, who in this day and age
has zero social media presence?

25:06.760 --> 25:10.480
-Is Whitmore even your real name?
-Yes.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.440
Are you really a doctor?

25:13.600 --> 25:16.440
-A&E.
-Mm.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.320
How do you afford
a place like this?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.760
Family money.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.600
You got like that when we
talked about the robbery.

25:28.760 --> 25:32.320
-Like what?
-Like you're hiding something.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.520
I'm not.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.400
Have you got
a secret identity or something?

25:37.560 --> 25:39.240
Are you a superhero?

25:39.400 --> 25:42.080
Yeah. You got me.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.640
My latex suit is hanging
upstairs in the wardrobe.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.760
Oh, hot.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.520
Mm. And now you're
tying to distract me.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.280
I'm not. I'm just trying to get...

26:30.200 --> 26:33.120
Curious that
we're meeting outside.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.720
What do you want, Gerbert?

26:34.880 --> 26:38.760
I hear whispers that you're
harboring Diana Bishop's aunts.

26:38.920 --> 26:43.200
-I'm assuming it's lies, of course.
-Of course.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.800
You do realize
they broke the covenant,

26:44.960 --> 26:47.080
inviting demons and
vampires into their house,

26:47.240 --> 26:49.520
fraternizing with other species.

26:49.680 --> 26:54.120
It's no concern of mine.
I've never met them.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.720
I was worried that
your love for Matthew

26:58.880 --> 27:01.320
might have blinded you.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.600
What would you know of love?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.160
Philippe devoted his life

27:08.320 --> 27:10.560
to the de Clermonts
and the vampire species.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.120
Always ensuring that
the interests of one

27:13.280 --> 27:14.640
served the other.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.920
Thanks to your son's
choice of mate,

27:17.080 --> 27:21.320
these interests are now
in direct conflict.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.360
I know he and his witch
are hiding somewhere in time,

27:27.520 --> 27:30.320
but what are they planning?

27:30.480 --> 27:35.360
You traveled 800 miles
from Venice to ask me that?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.800
Next time, send an email.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.640
Humans are
being murdered in Oxford

27:41.800 --> 27:44.160
by a vampire.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.120
A vampire infected
with blood rage.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.120
And what do you
expect me to do about it?

27:53.280 --> 27:56.560
There were always rumors
about your bloodline.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.360
Side with me

28:03.520 --> 28:07.200
and I'll steer any investigation

28:07.360 --> 28:10.800
away from your family.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.400
We have nothing
to do with this.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.520
Time will tell, Ysabeau.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.560
This space
is safe and sacred.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.120
This path
is closed to evil.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.440
Rebecca?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.640
I can't hear you.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.360
-Emily.
-Oh, my God! It's working.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.920
Rebecca.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.840
Rebecca.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.160
Don't go.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.880
No! No! Oh.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.880
Hi. Who are you?

32:40.040 --> 32:43.120
Oh, Phoebe.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.920
I'm with Marcus.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.400
-Oh. Right. I'm Sophie.
-Hi.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.200
That's not... Marcus's, is it?

32:53.360 --> 32:55.800
Oh! God, no.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.920
-Phoebe?
-I'll just... leave you to it.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.960
I deal with con artists
all the time, Marcus,

33:09.120 --> 33:13.280
so I know when someone's
hiding something.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.840
There are photos

33:15.000 --> 33:18.800
from, like, 20 years ago
going back to the 1800s.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.680
How do all of your relations
look exactly the same?

33:22.840 --> 33:26.720
Marcus, there's
a bag of blood in your fridge.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.320
-Are you ill or something?
-No.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.560
No. So it's there because, what?

33:37.320 --> 33:41.400
You know, I...
I really like you, Marcus,

33:41.560 --> 33:43.960
and I have never
liked anyone, but...

33:44.120 --> 33:47.560
nothing in your life
makes sense.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.600
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.520
Phoebe, wait.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.640
Could we take a walk?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.720
I don't really
know where to start.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.120
Whatever it is,
just tell me.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.680
Can't be that bad.

34:20.680 --> 34:22.280
I'm a vampire.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.480
Come on, Marcus.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.400
Phoebe, seriously.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.200
I'm hundreds of years old.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.760
You catalog history.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.400
I've lived it.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.200
I know it sounds crazy.

34:42.360 --> 34:46.440
Humans share this planet
with other creatures.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.800
With vampires,
witches and demons

34:48.960 --> 34:52.240
who hide in plain sight
and they're all around you.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.600
Creatures like me.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.600
So, you're not
a superhero, just...

35:01.760 --> 35:03.520
an actual vampire

35:03.680 --> 35:07.800
It's funny 'cause I didn't see
a coffin in your apartment.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.440
Everything you think
you know about us

35:13.600 --> 35:16.560
is human propaganda
based on half-truths

35:16.720 --> 35:19.440
passed down and distorted
through millennia.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.280
But we're real
and we're everywhere.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.600
You seriously believe this.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.800
I swear
I'm telling the truth.

35:32.800 --> 35:37.160
Then I feel sorry for you.
I think you need help.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.480
-No. Please listen.
-No. Seriously.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.440
We had a nice night.
Don't spoil it.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.360
Goodbye, Marcus.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.120
Would it kill you to answer
your phone once in a while?

36:11.720 --> 36:13.400
I've been busy.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.640
So was someone else.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.080
Do you know
anything about this?

36:19.240 --> 36:21.040
It's all over the internet.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.440
Only that Domenico
has been sniffing around.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.760
Must be working
with Gerbert.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.080
What are you
doing here, Baldwin?

36:33.240 --> 36:36.600
Ysabeau wants me to speak
to Miriam about the murders.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.920
I could have done that.
Why didn't she ask me?

36:39.080 --> 36:41.640
Maybe she thought you had
enough on your plate.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.480
You can ask her yourself.
She wants to see you.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.480
I know Matthew's
made you Grand Master.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.640
Sounds like
your worst nightmare.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.720
All that responsibility
and pressure.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.960
Let me do you a favor
and take it off your hands.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.240
So, that's why
you've come here.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.120
These are dangerous times.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.240
The congregation
wanted my head, Marcus.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.240
Gerbert is frothing at the
prospect of unseating us.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.840
Our future is hanging
in the balance.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.080
The Knights may be
needed at any moment,

37:14.240 --> 37:16.720
and they need an experienced,
committed leader.

37:16.880 --> 37:21.800
Matthew didn't give me a choice.
It is what it is.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.920
I am Philippe's
only surviving blood son.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.360
I should be Grand Master.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.880
-Matthew's using you to get to me.
-You're wrong.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.400
He trusts me
to make a difference.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.880
He's been lying to you
your whole life.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.120
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:43.280 --> 37:44.840
Marcus...

37:49.480 --> 37:52.320
You don't want
to be saddled with this.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.040
Just turn the Knights
over to me,

37:55.200 --> 37:58.480
and you can go on living
your life among the humans.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.480
They're the people
you really care about.

38:01.640 --> 38:05.760
Wouldn't be an abdication. You'd
simply be doing the right thing.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.240
Step out of Matthew's shadow.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.240
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.360
The latest murder
is all over the Internet.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.320
It's a fucking hashtag.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.680
It's just tabloid hysteria.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.360
<i>They don't suspect</i>
<i>an actual vampire.</i>

39:13.520 --> 39:16.480
-Do you have any leads yet?
-No.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.280
You'd better not
be holding out on me.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.040
Why would you reveal your
true self to a human?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.080
I had to.
I wanted to.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.360
Well, now you'll
have to kill her.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.680
She won't tell anyone.
She thinks I'm a head case.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.560
Saved by her
lack of imagination.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.920
Nevertheless,
Matthew appointed you

39:44.080 --> 39:47.760
Grand Master of the Knights
to protect our family's position.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.760
-Not undermine it.
-I didn't ask for any of this.

39:50.920 --> 39:54.440
A Grand Master
can't be reckless.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.680
You need to understand
your new responsibilities.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.240
There are artifacts
and papers here

40:15.400 --> 40:17.920
dating back to the
formation of the Knights,

40:18.080 --> 40:20.600
nearly 900 years ago.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.840
The Knights did
some amazing things,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.120
a long time ago.

40:32.280 --> 40:37.240
What's their relevance today?
What are they doing right now?

40:37.400 --> 40:41.240
You're Grand Master.
That's for you to decide.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.800
If I'm in charge,
I want to shake things up.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.720
Use the Knights
to make a real difference.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.800
We should be looking forward,
not backwards.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.720
Don't tear down
the establishment

40:56.880 --> 41:01.880
without finding out how it was built
or understanding its principles.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.680
Baldwin wants
the Knights so badly.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.440
He always has.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.960
He needs to feel
close to his father.

41:12.120 --> 41:14.120
Why did you
send him to Oxford?

41:16.120 --> 41:19.560
I had no choice.
Events are in motion

41:19.720 --> 41:23.760
that threaten
the future of our family.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.440
The murders?

41:26.760 --> 41:29.360
What have they
got to do with us?

41:30.240 --> 41:33.040
Philippe formed the
congregation and the Knights

41:33.200 --> 41:36.120
to ensure the survival
of our species,

41:37.120 --> 41:39.120
but also...

41:39.280 --> 41:42.120
to protect me.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.400
The disease is in my bloodline.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.920
-No.
-I'm asymptomatic,

41:52.080 --> 41:56.240
but others weren't
so fortunate.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.760
That means that Matthew...

42:01.920 --> 42:04.680
Matthew is fully afflicted.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.160
But he sired me.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.480
You and I are carriers.

42:11.640 --> 42:14.520
The disease lives
in our blood.

42:14.680 --> 42:18.080
That's why the children
you sired were culled.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.800
But Matthew said
I was siring irresponsibly.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.640
You'd passed on the disease.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.480
He was under orders from Philippe
to wipe it out.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.520
Baldwin knew.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.600
You all knew
and you kept it from me.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.960
It was Matthew's decision.

42:38.120 --> 42:42.960
-He chose to protect you from the truth.
-Protect me?

42:43.120 --> 42:45.480
Now you understand?

42:45.640 --> 42:49.960
Gerbert is waiting
for any opportunity

42:50.120 --> 42:51.600
to take our family down.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.840
If we're linked to the murders,
if our secret is uncovered,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.280
the congregation
will come for us.

42:57.440 --> 43:01.760
They'll kill you,
me, Matthew,

43:02.800 --> 43:05.520
every one of us.

43:05.680 --> 43:09.400
It will be the end
of the de Clermonts.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.600
Am I better company
than my brother?

43:28.400 --> 43:30.320
Do not try
and greet Philippe.

43:30.480 --> 43:33.880
<i>I'm sure your spies have told you</i>
<i>everything elseyou need to know.</i>

43:34.040 --> 43:37.760
You should have told me yourself
about your witch.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.160
Get out!

43:45.280 --> 43:46.920
No.
