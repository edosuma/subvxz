WEBVTT

00:04.333 --> 00:06.733
When was the last time
you really slept a night?

00:06.903 --> 00:08.234
Let's just work, all right?

00:16.712 --> 00:19.203
Killer clown.
I know what you're thinking, Sam.

00:19.382 --> 00:21.782
- Why did it have to be clowns?
- Give me a break.

00:21.951 --> 00:23.441
Ha, you didn't think I remember.

00:23.619 --> 00:26.918
You still bust out crying
whenever you see Ronald McDonald.

00:27.089 --> 00:28.920
- I'm not afraid of flying.
- Planes crash.

00:29.091 --> 00:30.183
And clowns kill.

00:45.107 --> 00:47.439
It's okay. They can't hurt you.

00:47.610 --> 00:48.872
They can't hurt you.

00:49.045 --> 00:51.639
If it bleeds, you can kill it. Yeah.

00:51.814 --> 00:53.281
If it bleeds, you can kill it.

01:46.669 --> 01:48.034
Hello?

01:51.307 --> 01:52.569
I am the egg man.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.837
Seriously, Frank, pay phones?
Come on. Uh...

01:57.013 --> 02:00.005
I'm getting the clap off this thing
just touching it.

02:01.651 --> 02:04.051
Fred Savage? Really?

02:04.220 --> 02:07.212
Yeah. No, I know.
Big Mouths are everywhere.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.316
Uh, well, since you asked...

02:10.493 --> 02:13.326
...some actual intel
on the Dick Roman guy would be nice.

02:14.030 --> 02:16.055
Fine. All right.

02:16.232 --> 02:18.291
Yeah, good looking out.

02:23.306 --> 02:24.739
Hope he finds something quick.

02:24.907 --> 02:27.398
This protocol du jour thing's
creeping my cheese.

02:27.643 --> 02:28.905
So we got dick on Dick?

02:30.980 --> 02:32.345
- Vivid way of putting it.
- Heh.

02:32.515 --> 02:33.709
Find anything on Wonder Woman?

02:33.883 --> 02:36.511
No. There probably won't be.
They are definitely gone.

02:36.686 --> 02:38.654
But might have found something
in Kansas.

02:38.821 --> 02:42.154
All right, well, let's do it.
But a few simple rules, okay? No babies.

02:42.325 --> 02:44.054
- Heh.
- No baby mamas, no bars...

02:44.226 --> 02:47.354
...no booze, no hot chicks of any kind.

02:47.530 --> 02:50.397
- Heh, wait. Did you just say...?
- Hey. You spawn a monster baby...

02:50.566 --> 02:53.535
...see how quick you wanna dive
back in the pool.

02:55.471 --> 02:57.132
Ooh.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.000
- Those are not the fun kind of hickeys.
- You're saying an octopus did this?

03:02.178 --> 03:03.839
Not just any octopus.

03:04.013 --> 03:08.416
<i>Based on welt diameter,
Enteroctopus dofleini.</i>

03:08.584 --> 03:12.042
<i>And for those of us
who skipped the Enteroctopus class?</i>

03:12.221 --> 03:14.712
Giant Pacific Octopus.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.518
- How giant we talking, doc?
- Approximately 30 feet.

03:21.197 --> 03:24.030
I mean, aren't giant octopi rare
around here?

03:24.233 --> 03:25.564
Yet here we are.

03:25.768 --> 03:29.534
So, what happens, guy comes home,
cracks a beer and gets suckered to death?

03:29.705 --> 03:32.196
Obviously, this was some kind
of freak fetish attack.

03:32.375 --> 03:36.709
Someone created those hickey marks,
then bled the man out.

03:41.283 --> 03:43.410
- Bite look vampy to you?
- Yeah, no question.

03:43.586 --> 03:47.488
So, what are we looking for?
An OctoVamp? Vamptopus?

03:47.723 --> 03:50.692
- That's crazy even for us, right?
- It does push the envelope.

03:50.893 --> 03:53.088
Let's go chat up the widow.

03:55.631 --> 03:57.792
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.765
Mrs. Harper,
we know this is, uh, bad timing...

04:00.936 --> 04:04.235
...but we have a few routine questions
we need to ask. Is that okay?

04:04.407 --> 04:05.772
Yeah.

04:06.008 --> 04:08.306
Did the house feel any different lately?

04:08.511 --> 04:10.809
- Different?
- Anything strange.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.006
Cold spots.
Uh, did you smell anything weird?

04:14.216 --> 04:17.447
- Maybe sulfury.
- No. Not that I can remember.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.180
Okay, we're just ticking
all the boxes here. Um...

04:21.357 --> 04:24.224
What about any skeletons
in your husband's closet?

04:24.427 --> 04:26.156
Skeletons? What do you mean?

04:26.328 --> 04:29.092
Can you think of anybody
who would wanna do him harm?

04:29.265 --> 04:32.166
A colleague, an old flame.

04:34.737 --> 04:37.433
The tiniest detail could really help.

04:37.673 --> 04:40.141
You wanna know
what he was up to lately...

04:40.342 --> 04:42.139
...ask Stacey.

04:42.344 --> 04:43.971
She was here the night he died.

04:45.014 --> 04:48.245
- Um, Stacey?
- Our nanny.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.514
Any other questions?

04:52.688 --> 04:54.883
No, that's, um...

04:55.057 --> 04:58.185
Thank you. You've been a big help.

05:05.034 --> 05:07.400
Really appreciate the hospitality,
ma'am.

05:17.313 --> 05:20.976
<i>Mom, Dad, nanny. Boy, that is a
love triangle right out of Casa Erotica.</i>

05:21.150 --> 05:23.345
Of course, in those, the jealous wife...

05:23.519 --> 05:25.510
...tends to channel her feelings
more productively.

05:26.889 --> 05:28.823
Only thing
I can't wrap my mind around is...

05:28.991 --> 05:30.982
How wife lady summoned
an OctoVamp?

05:31.193 --> 05:33.661
More like why?
Kind of impractical, right?

05:34.864 --> 05:38.322
Yeah. All right, one of us needs
to go talk to the naughty nanny...

05:38.501 --> 05:41.902
...the other one shake down the place,
see what we're dealing with.

05:42.104 --> 05:45.039
- All right. I'm on the nanny.
- I'm on the nanny.

05:45.207 --> 05:46.834
Heh, I thought you said no hot chicks.

05:47.009 --> 05:49.569
We don't know that she's hot.

05:52.581 --> 05:56.244
Now, uh, how would you describe
your relationship with the deceased?

05:56.418 --> 05:58.852
I don't know. Normal, I guess.

05:59.021 --> 06:01.751
- Normal?
- Well, I mostly dealt with Debra.

06:03.359 --> 06:05.850
There was nothing going on,
if that's what you mean.

06:06.028 --> 06:09.896
Debra said you were at the house late
the night that, uh, Brian died.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.460
Yeah.

06:12.768 --> 06:15.032
Brian was working late,
so I stayed with Kelly.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.468
- She was pretty upset.
- Why's that?

06:19.241 --> 06:22.404
Well, it was her birthday.
We had a party at Plucky's.

06:23.112 --> 06:25.740
Plucky's.
Why does that sound familiar?

06:25.915 --> 06:28.941
Plucky Pennywhistle's
Magical Menagerie?

06:29.118 --> 06:31.279
Pizza chain for kids.

06:31.453 --> 06:33.648
Actually, more for lazy parents.

06:34.957 --> 06:38.290
Anyway, her dad showed up
for five minutes...

06:38.460 --> 06:39.950
...then he went back to work.

06:40.129 --> 06:43.223
And, of course,
her mom was out of town.

06:43.399 --> 06:47.392
This stupid kid told Kelly her folks
didn't really love her. She freaked.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.504
I was calming her down for hours.

06:49.672 --> 06:52.505
Uh, did you notice anything weird
at the house?

06:53.409 --> 06:54.740
Weird like?

06:54.944 --> 06:56.969
Anything. Even a bad feeling.

06:57.146 --> 07:00.013
No, nothing like that.

07:00.649 --> 07:05.609
Actually, Kelly does have a weird thing
about closets.

07:06.021 --> 07:07.989
Heh, but it's just kid stuff.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.282
Try me.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.419
She thinks
there's a monster in her closet.

07:13.596 --> 07:15.086
Drives everyone crazy.

07:15.264 --> 07:16.731
Heh.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.162
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, we talked to the wrong person.</i>

07:21.337 --> 07:23.532
<i>- What?
- Forget the mom. Talk to the daughter.</i>

07:23.706 --> 07:25.970
She's mad at her dad
for ditching her birthday.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.803
<i>You think, uh, a birthday wish
gone wrong? Something like that?</i>

07:28.978 --> 07:31.276
- I don't know. Could be.
- I got a 20 on her now.

07:31.447 --> 07:33.938
<i>Can you get to her
without tripping the Amber Alert?</i>

07:34.984 --> 07:37.043
- I'll try.
- All right, see what you can find out.

07:42.024 --> 07:44.288
What you working on there?

07:44.660 --> 07:45.957
I know who you are.

07:47.429 --> 07:48.760
- You do?
- Mm-hm...

07:48.931 --> 07:50.626
...you're the guy that talked to my mom.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.059
Heh, that's right, I did.

07:53.235 --> 07:55.999
Kelly? Where are you, honey?

07:56.205 --> 07:58.173
Something wrong?

07:58.641 --> 08:01.633
My mom will get mad if I talk to you.

08:02.444 --> 08:04.071
Um...

08:04.246 --> 08:06.806
- How come?
- Because of what I told the police.

08:06.982 --> 08:09.246
What did you tell the police?

08:10.386 --> 08:13.480
I told them that
I tried to warn my dad.

08:13.856 --> 08:15.050
That the monster would get him.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.260
Kelly? Come here, now.

08:19.828 --> 08:21.659
Kelly.

09:45.581 --> 09:46.809
If it bleeds, you can kill it.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.948
Ooh.

10:15.744 --> 10:16.768
Huh.

10:19.181 --> 10:20.944
Hey, um...

10:21.283 --> 10:23.376
Okay, so the horse I get,
the hoof prints...

10:23.552 --> 10:26.680
...the jumping over the fence,
but, uh, what ran him through?

10:26.855 --> 10:28.686
Best I can tell you is something big.

10:29.525 --> 10:30.651
So, what like a lance?

10:40.469 --> 10:43.461
Sad. Lady's gotta pull her
frigging 8-year-old out of school...

10:43.672 --> 10:45.936
...and tell him his dad's dead.

10:47.276 --> 10:49.073
Excuse me.

10:51.914 --> 10:54.781
Excuse me, ma'am. Agent Jones, FBI.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.441
I'm sorry, I really need to go.

10:57.619 --> 11:00.850
Okay. Uh, just one quick question,
if you don't mind.

11:01.023 --> 11:03.856
Um, was yesterday your son's birthday?

11:04.927 --> 11:08.294
Billy's birthday?
No. Why would you ask that?

11:09.898 --> 11:10.956
Nothing. Never mind.

11:11.667 --> 11:18.231
Oh. But his father did take him
to a friend's birthday party yesterday.

11:28.317 --> 11:29.807
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

11:30.018 --> 11:33.249
<i>You remember a chain
called Plucky Pennywhistle's?</i>

11:35.324 --> 11:36.848
- No.
- Really?

11:37.025 --> 11:40.256
- Could've sworn you loved those places.
- No, dude, I hated them.

11:40.429 --> 11:43.523
Uh, you would dump me
and go trolling for chicks.

11:44.099 --> 11:46.829
It's not like I left you in jail.
Those places are fun.

11:47.035 --> 11:49.299
Fun? Uh, they're lame.

11:49.505 --> 11:52.440
And they smell like puke,
and the ice cream is all grainy.

11:52.641 --> 11:54.472
<i>Don't have one of your episodes, okay?</i>

11:54.643 --> 11:57.476
I hit a dead end with this whole
wishes-gone-wild thing...

11:57.646 --> 12:00.274
...but both kids were at Plucky's
day of.

12:00.816 --> 12:03.649
<i>Go check out the local Plucky's,
ask about this Billy kid.</i>

12:03.819 --> 12:07.516
Look, man, uh, why don't I just wait
for you to get back?

12:07.756 --> 12:10.020
<i>No can do, hermano.
I'm on my way to talk to Billy.</i>

12:10.192 --> 12:13.855
Oh, why don't I talk to Billy right now?

12:14.596 --> 12:18.532
Heh, wait, wait, wait. This isn't about,
uh, your clown thing, is it?

12:19.167 --> 12:20.395
What?

12:20.969 --> 12:23.403
<i>- No.
- Sammy.</i>

12:23.906 --> 12:25.840
No. Heh.

12:26.008 --> 12:29.637
What in the world did they do to you?
All right, you know what? Never mind.

12:29.811 --> 12:34.214
Just know that 99.99 percent
of all clowns can't hurt you, okay?

12:34.416 --> 12:37.715
And if it bleeds, you can kill it.

12:40.222 --> 12:41.689
If it bleeds, you can kill it.

12:41.857 --> 12:44.223
<i>Have fun.</i>

12:53.669 --> 12:55.227
I'm too old for this.

12:57.005 --> 12:58.700
Heh, oh, yeah.

12:58.874 --> 13:02.241
<i>Welcome to Plucky Pennywhistle's.</i>

13:02.411 --> 13:05.574
<i>Have fun, ha-ha-ha.</i>

13:08.717 --> 13:10.184
<i>Welcome to Plucky...</i>

13:10.385 --> 13:14.412
Welcome to Plucky's,
where all your dreams are good.

13:14.856 --> 13:18.257
Could you just maybe...?
Just get the manager for me?

13:19.595 --> 13:20.823
Okay.

13:25.467 --> 13:29.096
<i>Welcome to Plucky Pennywhistle's.</i>

13:37.646 --> 13:40.240
<i>Welcome to Plucky Pennywhistle's.</i>

13:42.484 --> 13:46.284
<i>A medium pixie pizza is ready for pickup.</i>

13:46.455 --> 13:49.720
I just need you to stay sane
for three more hours, okay?

13:49.891 --> 13:51.552
Here.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.853
Finish your homework.

13:54.062 --> 13:57.259
Like I can concentrate in here.

14:03.405 --> 14:05.236
- There's this really cool game.
- Yeah?

14:05.407 --> 14:07.466
Have you seen it?

14:17.319 --> 14:19.014
Real beauties, huh?

14:19.187 --> 14:22.350
We rotate them out once a week.
Kids love having their art on the wall.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.186
Draw your worst fear?

14:25.394 --> 14:28.591
I know.
But we don't post the truly evil stuff.

14:28.764 --> 14:32.165
Just the standard crap
like sharks and ghosts.

14:33.402 --> 14:36.030
- Jean Holiday, shift manager.
- Johnson, FBI.

14:36.204 --> 14:38.434
So, heh, tell me...

14:38.607 --> 14:41.838
...why even ask the kids
to draw creepy stuff to begin with?

14:42.010 --> 14:45.878
It's just an exercise
some pop psychologist came up with.

14:46.048 --> 14:49.176
Plus the owner is obsessed
with "aiding children's development."

14:49.351 --> 14:53.219
So the placemat is a safe way
to get kids to talk about their fears.

14:53.555 --> 14:55.716
We get them to sketch it
in the little box...

14:55.924 --> 15:00.520
...and voila, Plucky magically
transforms it into rainbows and candy.

15:00.696 --> 15:04.792
Personally, I think it's a load of hooey,
but they say if these fears run wild...

15:04.966 --> 15:08.424
...then it affects kids
long into their adulthood.

15:14.476 --> 15:17.070
Yeah, I've heard that.

15:17.579 --> 15:19.274
Um...

15:19.448 --> 15:21.211
So I don't know if you'll remember...

15:21.450 --> 15:24.886
...but there was, uh, a kid in here
yesterday named Billy Pogue, for a party.

15:25.053 --> 15:27.647
- Oh, the conniption kid.
- Conniption? He had a...?

15:27.823 --> 15:30.053
No, no, not him. He was fine.
It was his dad.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.887
He pulls the kid away
before cake and presents.

15:33.061 --> 15:35.052
The kid asked to stay
for five minutes...

15:35.230 --> 15:38.688
...the dad pulls a full frontal douche bag,
starts screaming.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.390
I was embarrassed for the kid.

15:42.404 --> 15:45.373
<i>Any available Plucky,
please come to the front desk.</i>

15:45.540 --> 15:48.373
<i>We have a birthday party
waiting to happen.</i>

15:48.543 --> 15:50.033
<i>Any available Plucky...</i>

15:54.049 --> 15:55.380
Hey.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.620
You a cop?

16:01.590 --> 16:04.058
Uh, yeah. I'm a fed.

16:05.026 --> 16:07.256
What are you investigating?

16:07.596 --> 16:11.293
A couple of crazy deaths.
Why, something you wanna share?

16:11.733 --> 16:16.602
Look, not now. Too many eyes. Yeah.

16:16.772 --> 16:19.138
Come back after closing.

16:27.883 --> 16:32.377
Hey. So, uh, what's the lowdown
with trauma town?

16:34.823 --> 16:37.553
I can tell you, uh,
neither vic was up for parent of the year.

16:37.726 --> 16:40.559
Kelly's dad skipped her birthday,
and Billy's dad pulled...

16:40.729 --> 16:43.721
...one of those dick-parent scenes
that makes everyone cringe.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.457
- What the hell are these?
- Kid therapy.

16:45.634 --> 16:48.296
Um, you draw your worst nightmare,
poof, Plucky fixes it.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.938
Um, they hang them up on this big wall.

16:51.106 --> 16:54.132
Well, can't argue with this.
Leprechauns are deadly.

16:55.510 --> 16:58.001
Okay, so Kelly draws a monster...

16:58.180 --> 17:01.775
...and then that goes after her father,
that's what we're saying?

17:01.983 --> 17:05.544
Here's the thing, they label those.
And guess which two were missing.

17:05.753 --> 17:07.915
Well, name tag was there,
no placemat.

17:08.123 --> 17:10.819
- Little Miss OctoVamp.
- Yeah.

17:11.358 --> 17:12.383
And Billy.

17:12.560 --> 17:16.656
Ahem, so somehow, whatever he drew
came to life and killed his dad...

17:16.832 --> 17:18.196
...riding a horse.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.230
Close, but no Seabiscuit.

17:20.402 --> 17:23.633
Ahem, see, I went and had a little chat
with Billy...

17:23.839 --> 17:25.932
...and he drew me this.

17:30.445 --> 17:32.709
Wait. So now unicorns are evil?

17:33.815 --> 17:34.873
Yeah, obviously.

17:36.151 --> 17:38.483
Great. Well, now the question is...

17:38.653 --> 17:42.521
...how did a unicorn come off a sketch
and kill Billy's dad?

17:42.724 --> 17:44.521
How's any of this happening?

17:47.629 --> 17:49.221
Well, that's it for me.

17:49.464 --> 17:52.160
- Guess I'll head out.
- Uh, one more thing.

17:52.367 --> 17:56.326
Some kid puked in the ball pit.
It's gonna need a full sanitization.

17:56.538 --> 17:59.132
Do that, and then you can clock out.

19:24.392 --> 19:26.223
Coming through.

19:29.130 --> 19:31.223
- All right.
- Good. Got it?

19:31.399 --> 19:33.890
Hold on one second there, guys.

19:36.204 --> 19:37.728
Keep in touch.

19:38.273 --> 19:40.207
Uh, thank you.

19:43.411 --> 19:44.435
So?

19:44.646 --> 19:47.342
Manager found the body in the ball pit,
blood everywhere.

19:47.515 --> 19:49.983
- Cops have a theory?
- The ball washer did it.

19:50.151 --> 19:51.618
- The what?
- The ball washer.

19:51.786 --> 19:54.016
- The what?
- The ball...

19:54.622 --> 19:56.453
Look at this.

19:59.327 --> 20:00.658
Thank you, gentlemen.

20:00.829 --> 20:02.456
Thanks.

20:04.366 --> 20:06.300
- That's a shark bite.
- Yeah.

20:06.501 --> 20:09.664
And, uh, judging from the radius,
I'd say a 20-footer at least.

20:11.339 --> 20:14.001
Shark Week, man.
How do you not watch that?

20:15.110 --> 20:16.941
A whole week of sharks.

20:31.793 --> 20:34.353
"Omar Cooper." Heh.

20:34.529 --> 20:37.191
How much you wanna bet Omar here
was scared of sharks?

20:37.365 --> 20:40.232
Saul the janitor is connected how?
He's not related to Omar.

20:40.402 --> 20:43.394
No. But Saul had something
he wanted to tell me.

20:43.571 --> 20:45.903
So this isn't about ganking
some dickweed parent?

20:46.808 --> 20:48.639
More like, uh, silencing a whistleblower.

20:48.810 --> 20:52.974
Great. So whatever we're looking for can
literally fire off childhood fears at will.

20:53.281 --> 20:55.875
Well, watch out for evil lunch ladies.

20:56.051 --> 20:59.179
All right. Let's comb this place.

21:00.622 --> 21:02.522
Seriously?

21:02.791 --> 21:08.525
Dractopus, Seabiscuit the Impaler,
Land Shark, what's next?

21:16.671 --> 21:19.401
Okay, Tyler, that's it.
You gotta take the bus from here.

21:19.574 --> 21:22.941
- But I thought...
- I can't, I'm sorry, I'm late.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.206
Here.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.885
Stay out of trouble.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.645
- Unh.
- Oh. Oh.

22:04.085 --> 22:05.518
Unh, oh!

22:17.899 --> 22:18.991
Maybe a tulpa?

22:20.869 --> 22:22.393
No, killings are too spread out.

22:23.171 --> 22:24.729
True. Um...

22:24.906 --> 22:25.964
Angel?

22:26.374 --> 22:28.865
It's a little imaginative
for the God Squad, don't you think?

22:30.245 --> 22:31.735
Right. So what?

22:32.580 --> 22:34.980
Yeah, I don't know, I'm tapped out.

22:36.084 --> 22:39.781
Well, whatever it is,
at least we know where it is.

22:40.121 --> 22:41.145
Plucky's.

22:41.322 --> 22:44.086
That's where the victims
are getting picked up.

22:44.259 --> 22:47.990
Yeah, but we swept the place last night,
and nada.

22:49.097 --> 22:51.964
I can go back, grill the employees,
maybe dig up some dirt.

22:52.133 --> 22:54.192
What good's that gonna do?
They think you're a fed.

22:54.369 --> 22:56.496
The one guy who was gonna rat,
he got Bruce'd.

22:57.105 --> 22:59.096
Anybody knows anything,
they're not gonna tell you.

22:59.274 --> 23:01.435
All right, yup, that's the plan.

23:02.110 --> 23:05.102
I'll go back, play bad cop,
really lean into them.

23:06.281 --> 23:11.048
- And?
- And when I'm done, you watch them.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.481
If somebody freaks out,
then that's our creep.

23:13.655 --> 23:16.317
Or he'll lead us closer,
and you can track him.

23:16.524 --> 23:18.515
Well, what's my cover?

23:19.494 --> 23:22.952
I don't know, just hang back.
Act normal.

23:25.934 --> 23:29.461
Yeah. Yeah, a guy in his 30s hanging out
at Plucky's alone. That's normal.

23:29.671 --> 23:31.366
That's not pervy at all.

23:31.539 --> 23:34.133
It doesn't matter what people say.
We've roped it off.

23:34.309 --> 23:36.300
I've notified the powers that be.
Everyone's aware.

23:37.679 --> 23:40.045
- Just no one goes in the...
- Hi.

23:40.515 --> 23:41.641
Agent.

23:41.849 --> 23:44.044
- Bet I know why you're here.
- How's business?

23:44.686 --> 23:47.621
Turns out not even grim flipping death
can slow down the birthday fun.

23:47.789 --> 23:48.813
Hmm.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.720
We roped off the ball pit though,
until corporate can get here.

23:53.161 --> 23:55.652
I can't believe
the machine did Saul in like that.

23:55.830 --> 23:59.231
That makes two of us. I'm gonna need
to talk to some of your employees.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.958
- Like who?
- Like you.

24:06.507 --> 24:07.974
Bye.

24:09.777 --> 24:11.745
He's so funny. You want some more?

24:11.913 --> 24:14.211
- See you later.
- Bye.

24:14.382 --> 24:16.247
Hi.

24:16.417 --> 24:17.714
Oh, yeah.

24:17.885 --> 24:20.046
- You finished, buddy?
- Here you go, honey.

24:23.258 --> 24:24.282
Howdy, friend.

24:24.492 --> 24:28.019
Giant slinky. Would've killed for one
of those when I was a kid. How much?

24:28.196 --> 24:30.061
- One thousand tickets.
- American dinero.

24:30.231 --> 24:32.290
Oh, we don't take cash
at Plucky Pennywhistle's.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.196
Only tickets won through hard work
and determination, heh.

24:36.504 --> 24:37.801
You mainlined the Kool-Aid?

24:42.076 --> 24:44.738
It's double-ticket Tuesday
if you play Skee-Ball.

24:46.614 --> 24:48.275
Heh, oh, yeah.

24:50.318 --> 24:51.751
Howdy, friend.

24:57.592 --> 24:58.957
Where were you last night?

24:59.560 --> 25:02.723
Well, here, obviously.

25:03.464 --> 25:05.125
I found him.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.091
I was by the cash register
the whole time.

25:08.303 --> 25:10.897
There's a security camera pointed
right at the counter.

25:11.072 --> 25:12.596
- The cops already looked at it.
- Uh-huh.

25:13.141 --> 25:14.233
And you heard nothing?

25:14.676 --> 25:16.644
I heard the ball blaster.

25:16.844 --> 25:20.041
I didn't hear him,
if I did I would've run in, of course.

25:20.248 --> 25:22.808
Yeah, right. Right.
So that's your excuse?

25:23.651 --> 25:24.777
My what?

25:25.353 --> 25:29.050
- Look, I know I'm new to this job, but...
- What?

25:29.257 --> 25:30.952
- How new?
- Couple weeks.

25:31.159 --> 25:32.353
Just got promoted.

25:33.828 --> 25:35.295
Hmm.

25:35.463 --> 25:39.763
So, uh, is there a lot of competition
for the gig?

25:39.967 --> 25:41.059
I guess.

25:42.370 --> 25:44.429
It comes with benefits.

25:45.473 --> 25:47.498
The bosses had us all write essays...

25:47.675 --> 25:51.372
...about how we would do our best
for the kids, and they picked me.

25:51.579 --> 25:54.980
Don't be shocked, but I actually did
two semesters at college, so...

25:57.118 --> 25:59.086
I'm not in any kind of trouble, am I?

25:59.520 --> 26:02.648
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

26:02.857 --> 26:06.190
Look, I know I'm not perfect,
but I'm trying.

26:06.661 --> 26:09.630
And, I mean, it's not as if
I'd ever do anything illegal.

26:10.331 --> 26:12.356
Sure you wouldn't.

26:16.537 --> 26:20.405
<i>Megan Eastberg, your
mom's waiting for you at the front desk.</i>

26:21.409 --> 26:25.539
<i>Megan, please find your mom
at the front desk.</i>

26:52.039 --> 26:55.031
Special agent, wow, ha, ha.

26:55.209 --> 26:58.042
I want you to know, sir,
I really appreciate what you do...

26:58.212 --> 27:00.009
Quiet.

27:12.059 --> 27:15.256
Hey. Stop cheating.

27:20.234 --> 27:21.701
You heard him. Knock it off.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.600
Jackass.

27:28.943 --> 27:30.274
Tyler, soup's on.

27:33.047 --> 27:34.878
- But, Mom, I don't want...
- Eat it.

27:35.049 --> 27:37.279
- But it sucks.
- Ugh.

27:46.227 --> 27:48.195
Why don't you cut her some slack?

27:48.396 --> 27:50.728
- Why do you care?
- Because I been where you are.

27:50.898 --> 27:53.628
Your mom made you camp
at a stupid Plucky's after school?

27:55.236 --> 28:00.970
No. No, but my dad,
he, uh, hauled me places.

28:01.909 --> 28:05.504
Besides, she's working a tough gig,
you know, she's exhausted.

28:06.147 --> 28:08.809
You should take pity on the old.

28:09.717 --> 28:13.278
- And, hey, free grub.
- That stuff tastes like butt.

28:13.488 --> 28:14.785
What?

28:14.989 --> 28:18.015
Come on, it can't be that bad.
Let's see here.

28:21.229 --> 28:22.719
Ah...

28:24.298 --> 28:25.993
That is butt.

28:31.138 --> 28:33.868
- You scared of robots?
- They have laser eyes.

28:34.041 --> 28:35.338
Yes.

28:35.510 --> 28:38.502
- Excuse me.
- Howdy, friend. What's your name?

28:38.679 --> 28:41.045
- Evan.
- Hi.

28:49.524 --> 28:50.957
Lose the head.

28:53.394 --> 28:54.452
Why'd you do it?

28:55.363 --> 28:56.455
Do what?

28:57.265 --> 28:58.664
I think you know.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.992
I...

29:01.269 --> 29:02.861
I got rights. You can't...

29:04.372 --> 29:06.431
I'm the government,
I can do whatever I want.

29:06.607 --> 29:07.972
Okay. I'll talk.

29:12.713 --> 29:13.873
Dean!

29:31.032 --> 29:33.296
Hey. Hey. Come here.

29:34.869 --> 29:36.427
Hey.

29:42.209 --> 29:45.201
If this is about the meth lab
that fireballed up, it wasn't me.

29:45.413 --> 29:49.110
It was my brother,
but we got the same fingerprints and...

29:49.884 --> 29:51.852
Please, this is the best job I ever had.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.453
- All right, look, uh...
- Cliff.

29:54.622 --> 29:59.082
Cliff. You're not using kids' nightmares
to smoke people, are you, Cliff?

29:59.327 --> 30:01.056
I don't think so.

30:04.265 --> 30:06.233
- Get up.
- What's going on?

30:06.434 --> 30:07.628
All right, cards up.

30:07.835 --> 30:10.770
We don't care that you, uh,
broke bad or whatever.

30:11.606 --> 30:15.599
- There is some seriously weird going on.
- You mean in the subbasement.

30:15.776 --> 30:17.641
This place has a subbasement?

30:17.845 --> 30:19.335
Sure. Door's out back.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.374
- Easy to miss if you don't know.
- What's in there?

30:22.550 --> 30:26.646
Alls I know is me and Saul used
to come in afterhours sometimes and...

30:29.924 --> 30:33.382
You ever shroom in a ball pit?

30:35.363 --> 30:37.422
Not that I would, agents.

30:37.598 --> 30:40.863
It was Saul. Just Saul. All alone.

30:41.068 --> 30:46.267
Anyway, sometimes we'd hear,
like, spooky stuff through the vents.

30:47.608 --> 30:49.166
Coming up from the boiler room.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.609
Okay, kiddo, let's go.

30:54.815 --> 30:58.581
- But somebody stole it.
- So draw another one.

30:58.919 --> 31:00.443
Okay?

31:00.655 --> 31:02.384
We gotta go.

31:05.259 --> 31:06.783
Okay, I'm sorry.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.464
- Thank you.
- That placemat sucked anyway.

31:23.477 --> 31:26.571
- Dean, what? What is it?
- While you were out being Dirty Harry...

31:26.747 --> 31:31.844
...uh, Tyler's mom got pissy with him,
and now his placemat's missing.

31:32.019 --> 31:33.680
So, what do you think?

31:33.854 --> 31:36.721
I think that bitchy mom,
plus, uh, sad kid...

31:36.957 --> 31:40.188
...plus, uh, placemat
with something nuts written on it...

31:40.361 --> 31:41.988
...equals wacky corpse.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.022
You think she's next on the list?

31:44.198 --> 31:46.996
- I'll tail them, to be safe. You...
- Check the boiler room.

31:47.168 --> 31:48.465
Right.

31:48.736 --> 31:50.169
Oh, Dean. Dean.

31:50.337 --> 31:52.703
- Uh, any idea what he drew?
- Robot.

31:52.873 --> 31:54.738
- Robot?
- About the size of a house.

31:54.942 --> 31:57.672
Shoots destruct-o-beams
out of its eyes.

31:58.813 --> 32:00.713
- At least I'll see it coming.
- Yeah.

32:21.869 --> 32:24.497
Now, that's perfectly normal.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.100
Drop it.

33:01.609 --> 33:02.871
Drop it.

33:08.182 --> 33:10.946
Mm-hm. Now kick it over.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.381
Some pretty heavy Hoodoo
you got here.

33:19.226 --> 33:22.593
I gotta say, as far as I know,
none of these things, uh...

33:22.763 --> 33:24.788
...could poop out a unicorn.

33:24.965 --> 33:27.763
There's power in fear.

33:28.736 --> 33:31.899
And when a child draws
what he's afraid of...

33:32.573 --> 33:36.634
...a little of that mojo
ends up on the page.

33:36.844 --> 33:38.573
So what, you toss it in the fire...

33:38.746 --> 33:41.579
...and some bed-wetter's horror show
comes to life?

33:41.749 --> 33:43.740
I gotta get something
off the parent too.

33:45.352 --> 33:46.785
Something they own.

33:46.987 --> 33:48.648
That bit gets tricky, heh.

33:49.323 --> 33:51.450
Well, hasn't seemed
to slow you down.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.991
I'm just doing what I need to.

33:54.161 --> 33:55.958
Okay, heh, okay.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.893
I get it. Okay?

34:02.269 --> 34:04.430
No drawing, no Iron Giant.

34:04.738 --> 34:05.762
Oh.

34:05.940 --> 34:09.341
That B word is still on the list.

34:09.510 --> 34:12.001
But not tonight. Bigger fish.

34:12.179 --> 34:14.647
What, are you gonna shoot me,
Howard?

34:14.815 --> 34:17.806
You really want a body on your hands?
Blood everywhere.

34:17.985 --> 34:23.150
I'd shut up. Because I got lots of ways
to take care of bullies. Don't you worry.

34:23.324 --> 34:25.690
Like that FBI guy. He's your pal, right?

34:27.161 --> 34:29.652
I saw you chase Cliff down.

34:30.030 --> 34:33.522
Five minutes ago,
his business card was torched...

34:34.301 --> 34:38.362
...along with something
from my personal collection.

34:40.241 --> 34:43.039
Yeah, I picked it out real special
for him too.

34:44.344 --> 34:47.007
<i>Soon as I saw him, I noticed.</i>

34:47.181 --> 34:52.641
<i>He was staring at every little Plucky
like it was gonna stab him or something.</i>

35:01.996 --> 35:05.124
Guy's got a real thing about clowns.

35:25.786 --> 35:28.778
Well, hey, these are, uh,
really nice dolls.

35:29.023 --> 35:31.548
Did you paint them yourself?

35:35.796 --> 35:37.457
Oh.

35:38.232 --> 35:39.665
Uh, frigging Plucky.

35:40.067 --> 35:41.398
Plucky helps kids.

35:41.802 --> 35:43.360
That's all I ever wanted to do.

35:43.971 --> 35:46.269
And when the management slot
opened up, l...

35:49.176 --> 35:50.734
But they passed me over.

35:51.312 --> 35:52.370
Shocker.

35:52.579 --> 35:56.071
I told them
no one cares more than me...

35:56.283 --> 35:58.547
...but suits never listen.

35:59.486 --> 36:01.784
So I'm doing it my way.

36:01.956 --> 36:03.617
Let me get this straight.

36:03.791 --> 36:07.249
You didn't get the good parking space,
so you start dropping bodies?

36:07.428 --> 36:10.886
Those parents were horrible.
They deserve what they got.

36:11.065 --> 36:13.465
- What about Saul?
- Saul had a big mouth.

36:16.937 --> 36:20.464
Some guy hits on the babysitter, all of
a sudden he's the world's worst dad?

36:20.808 --> 36:23.003
A good parent puts his kids first.

36:23.577 --> 36:27.445
And having a little girl watch her pop
get ganked by the closet monster...

36:27.614 --> 36:30.947
...that's putting her first?
In the long run, they'll be better off.

36:31.118 --> 36:33.848
- You think so? Really?
- I would have been.

36:44.164 --> 36:46.758
So your brother...

36:48.769 --> 36:51.499
...what happened to him?
It's not my fault, it's theirs.

36:57.211 --> 36:58.508
Ooh! Ow!

36:59.246 --> 37:00.611
Looks to me like he drowned.

37:03.450 --> 37:04.644
I was screaming...

37:05.552 --> 37:08.487
...but my folks, they didn't listen.

37:09.156 --> 37:10.623
They never listened.

37:10.791 --> 37:13.351
- It was an accident?
- They let him die.

37:13.527 --> 37:14.892
Ha-ha-ha!

37:27.574 --> 37:29.269
I'll bet you still have nightmares.

37:30.778 --> 37:33.542
- Bet you haven't been in the water since.
- Shut up!

37:34.048 --> 37:36.209
Because you're afraid.

37:39.186 --> 37:40.551
No!

37:59.239 --> 38:00.399
It wasn't my fault.

38:01.809 --> 38:03.299
I'm sorry.

38:57.931 --> 38:59.956
Let's roll.

39:03.470 --> 39:04.767
Go ahead, say it.

39:07.641 --> 39:08.801
I'm sorry.

39:09.409 --> 39:14.176
You look like you got attacked
by some PCP-crazed strippers.

39:17.017 --> 39:22.114
Dude, one of them sprayed me
with seltzer from his flower. Yeah.

39:25.325 --> 39:27.122
I'm sor... Ooh!

39:28.162 --> 39:30.790
- What?
- Nothing. Carry on.

39:32.432 --> 39:33.956
That's...

39:34.168 --> 39:35.897
Sam...

39:36.170 --> 39:40.163
...I'm sorry for, ahem,
psychologically scarring you.

39:42.176 --> 39:43.336
- Which time?
- Shut up.

39:43.510 --> 39:47.037
Seriously, me ditching you when
we were kids, that was a dick move.

39:47.214 --> 39:51.116
- You know, the whole clown thing...
- You know what, man? Honestly, I...

39:51.818 --> 39:55.777
Getting my ass kicked
by those Juggalos tonight was, uh...

39:57.157 --> 39:58.988
- Was therapeutic.
- You faced your fear.

39:59.159 --> 40:02.458
Exactly. And now, what else
could a clown possibly ever do to me?

40:02.629 --> 40:04.187
- I feel good.
- Well, congrats.

40:04.364 --> 40:05.922
By the way, to celebrate...

40:06.366 --> 40:08.197
- What?
- Ugh.

40:11.638 --> 40:12.662
- No.
- Yes.

40:12.873 --> 40:14.704
- Did you win this?
- We earned that.

40:15.809 --> 40:16.901
Ha, ha!

40:17.077 --> 40:20.740
Hey, I got you a little something too,
actually.

40:24.351 --> 40:25.909
What? You said you were over it.

40:26.086 --> 40:28.714
You can think of it as a, uh...

40:29.056 --> 40:31.752
...clown-phobia sobriety chip.
