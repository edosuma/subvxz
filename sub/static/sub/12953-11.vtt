00:10.000 --> 00:11.400
Bonsoir, madame.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.300
Margeaux Gerard.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.100
She's in position. No sign of Connelly.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.700
He'll reveal himself.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.200
Madame.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.000
Merci.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.000
Okay, she's just made the announcement.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.200
I thought you might not come.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.500
You underestimate me already.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.800
Well, I almost didn't come.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.700
Why is that? Crisis of conscience?

01:17.800 --> 01:20.800
I thought I might find a buyer willing to pay more.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.700
I am not here for small talk, monsieur Connelly.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.100
Are you selling or no?

01:28.400 --> 01:32.800
I presume you brought the down payment.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.000
We may have a possible third party.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.500
Sending you a visual, Outrigger.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.000
Got it. Searching for a match.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.699
So what are your plans

02:10.500 --> 02:11.900
with your new purchase?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.800
Monsieur Connelly,

02:14.200 --> 02:15.100
where...

02:15.600 --> 02:16.500
is...

02:17.200 --> 02:18.700
the chip?

02:25.100 --> 02:26.600
This is my way out.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.000
Anything, Outrigger?

02:33.100 --> 02:33.900
Come on.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
No matches, Shotgun.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.800
With this sale, I can buy a new life --

02:40.900 --> 02:42.600
a house on the Mediterranean.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.100
Maybe get a dog.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.700
We're under fire!

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
LÃ¢che le couteau!

03:06.100 --> 03:06.800
Freeze!

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
He won't get me.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.800
My family.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.800
I'm not gonna be made an example of.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.200
I won't have it.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.200
My wife...

03:28.400 --> 03:29.600
my kids.

03:29.700 --> 03:30.600
Put down the knife.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.900
Marshall ran analysis of the memory chip recovered in Paris.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.600
The downloaded information confirms that a biometric targeting device

03:42.800 --> 03:46.300
is in fact being developed at a secure facility in Austria.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.000
Attached to a weapons system,

03:48.100 --> 03:50.700
this device would facilitate the targeting of an individual

03:50.800 --> 03:53.600
based solely on a DNA sample or a biometric scan.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.100
Next gen sniper.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.100
Precisely.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.500
That's why I want you on a plane to Salzburg by nightfall.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.900
Standard retrieval operation.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.500
But...

04:03.800 --> 04:05.600
the man who killed himself?

04:05.700 --> 04:08.000
He was sent there to intercept the sale.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.000
When the assassin realized that the mission was a failure,

04:11.100 --> 04:14.700
he killed himself to protect his family from his employer.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.000
Sasha Korjev.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.400
I don't know that name.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.200
Korjev is a monster.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.400
He's run arms to rebel forces in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Angola,

04:28.500 --> 04:31.600
and holds a very tight leash over his men.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.400
Amongst Korjev's tactics is leveraging the lives of their families.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.500
And it's Korjev's network that's developing the targeting device?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.200
Yes, that's correct,

04:40.300 --> 04:42.200
but now that we have confirmation that Korjev is alive,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.800
I'm tasking Dixon to locate his whereabouts.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.200
He'll report to CIA proper.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.200
They'll send a tactical team to secure his arrest.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.100
I have a liaison at the angolan chancery in D.C.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.200
Put Dixon on something else.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.700
You want to take this over?

04:58.100 --> 04:59.900
For the sake of expediency.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.500
What am I missing?

05:02.400 --> 05:05.600
Okay, Jack. It's yours.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.100
Good luck in Salzburg.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.200
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.600
You got to bring the team in on this one.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.000
No way. Not until I find out more.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.400
All right, let's just assume that your father did write those journals --

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
Look, I know my father's handwriting, all right?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.300
Things were referenced.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.300
Things he couldn't know about. I know it sounds crazy --

05:27.400 --> 05:28.800
No, the Sox winning the series is crazy.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.400
What we're talking about doing here is insane.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.800
The nurse who led me to those journals, she disappeared. She was a plant.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.100
Fine, so someone's trying to manipulate you.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.800
What if my father's still alive?

05:36.100 --> 05:38.400
What if it's his way of trying to contact me?

05:39.000 --> 05:39.800
Okay.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.000
Okay, but why now?

05:43.300 --> 05:46.200
Why let you and your mother believe that he's been dead for 25 years?

05:46.700 --> 05:48.600
I don't know. That's what I'm gonna find out.

05:49.100 --> 05:49.600
Hey.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.700
What's this? Who's Frank Murdoch?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.800
The code name that you asked me to check in the journals.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.500
He's ex-special forces.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.100
Changed his name several times, finally settled on Frank Murdoch.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.800
He runs a furniture repair shop outside San Diego.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.800
You didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?

06:06.900 --> 06:07.500
D  ude.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.000
Nadia?

06:09.000 --> 06:09.700
Hey.

06:11.100 --> 06:11.800
Thanks.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.800
The angolan chancery in D.C. Hmm.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.700
Don't you think that's a bit thin, Jack?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.300
You should have brought this to me first.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.500
The details of Sasha Korjev's mission are classified.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.700
As far as anyone else is concerned,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.400
the assignment is merely to tag the location.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.900
The   CIA wants him assassinated.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.300
Which is why I thought it unfair to burden you with this.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.700
Dixon has the necessary experience.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.400
With Dixon it would have to be a distance hit.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.300
I'll be able to get close to Korjev.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.800
Oh, I'm aware of that.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.200
And frankly, that concerns me.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.200
I'll be fine.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.100
Korjev should have been eliminated years ago...

07:06.300 --> 07:08.200
when I had the chance.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.800
Man, look at you. Back from the dead.

07:26.900 --> 07:27.700
Hello, Jimmy.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.700
You look awful.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.400
I keep telling myself -- green vegetables.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.500
Got to eat more of them.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.300
But, uh, you know how that is.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.900
So, uh, Jack, you come bearing gifts?

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
Only the best.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.300
This -- this was hard to find.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.000
Is this, uh...

08:27.300 --> 08:29.400
I thought that it was just a rumor.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.000
Ah! Ha ha. Jack...

08:32.100 --> 08:34.000
Uh, what do you want?

08:34.100 --> 08:36.100
- Information.
- Anything.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.100
The protocol for contacting Sasha Korjev.

08:42.900 --> 08:46.900
Um... come on, Jack. You know I can't.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.700
I'm disappointed, Jimmy.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.500
I thought you were a true connoisseur.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.600
Seriously, man, that's just not right.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.400
Jack! Uh, please.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400
Korjev finds out it was me...

09:03.900 --> 09:07.600
My life may not be worth much.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.800
Wh-whatever.

09:09.000 --> 09:09.800
Still --

09:10.600 --> 09:11.700
Okay.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.000
I'll, uh...

09:17.000 --> 09:18.400
I'll lay it out for you.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.500
One small step for Mitchell Flinkman,

09:52.700 --> 09:55.200
one giant leap for mankind.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.800
Look at those legs.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.000
He's edible. He's delicious.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.300
I've taken many a chomp.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.200
Add a little salt and pepper.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.600
He's the best. Makes it all worth it.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.300
Sorry. Speaking of which -- Salzburg.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.900
Now, according to the memory chip,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.100
Korjev's storing the targeting system in the sub-basement

10:14.200 --> 10:16.200
of a discotheque at he owns called the Club Felice,

10:16.200 --> 10:19.900
which officially begs the question, what is it with these guys and nightclubs?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.600
Korjev's regional security chief is a Jeremiah Gauster.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.700
Gauster has instituted a security protocol based on access cards.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.600
You'll need a level 3 clearance to enter the belly of the building.

10:50.700 --> 10:55.000
Since the access card hardware is annoyingly difficult to duplicate,

10:55.300 --> 10:57.700
you'll need to steal one from one of the nightclub employees.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.700
Not bad.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.200
Definitely in the ballpark.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.600
Oh, my gosh, thank you for being an american.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.200
I don't think I could bear mangling the language in front of one more local.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.400
Shouldn't feel bad.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.200
These people like to be offended. It's their comfort zone.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.100
Let me guess. Upstate New York.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.000
Yeah. Yeah, Rochester.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.000
How'd you know that?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.600
I went to Buffalo state. Undergrad.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.400
Come on. Go Bengals.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.800
Don't even say that. It makes me want to cry. God, I miss it so much.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.300
This time of year, me and my girlfriends should be grabbing

11:59.400 --> 12:02.600
two beef on weck and a six-pack, you know --

12:03.000 --> 12:05.600
Oh, look at me -- root from the nosebleeds.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.000
There's nothing like roast beef and pilsner in 30-degree weather,

12:09.100 --> 12:10.100
you know what I mean?

12:10.500 --> 12:11.400
Yeah.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.100
Yeah, I do.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
Sam!

12:17.100 --> 12:17.800
That's me.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.500
Sam.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.500
Sorry I can't help you with your drink.

12:21.100 --> 12:21.900
Barback.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.500
The good thing/bad thing about living in Austria --

12:27.800 --> 12:29.100
smoking's not prohibited.

12:29.400 --> 12:33.800
Ergo, you've just developed a smoking habit.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.100
No, thanks.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.900
Good answer. Just checking.

12:37.300 --> 12:42.400
It is actually a mag strip encoder.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.600
Just slide it through here like so.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
It will analyze the access control algorithms,

12:48.500 --> 12:49.600
extrapolate the clearances,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.200
and then reprogram the card to give you full access.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.200
- Hey.
- Sam.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.600
- Do you need a light?
- No.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.100
Thank   you.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.300
I was just looking.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.100
Didn't mean to scare you.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.700
Whoops. Duh. Found it.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.900
Um, so, listen. Uh...

13:19.100 --> 13:21.000
I never do this. Really.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.300
But, um, I've been here for six months,

13:24.500 --> 13:26.600
and, uh, I don't really know anybody.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.500
At least not anybody who knows about beef on weck, so...

13:33.200 --> 13:37.200
That smile and those dimples are

13:37.300 --> 13:40.200
pretty much the greatest thing I've ever seen, so

13:40.300 --> 13:41.600
I thought if I didn't come over --

13:41.700 --> 13:42.700
I have a boyfriend.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.400
Right. No, right. Of course you do.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.300
But thank you.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.100
Guy's gotta try.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.300
Where's the bathroom?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.300
It's, uh, just -- just --

14:10.400 --> 14:11.300
Merlin?

14:12.000 --> 14:12.500
Merlin?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.700
Okay, I got you, Phoenix.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
Heading in.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.100
No one's supposed to be down there.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.300
Run a sweep on section Delta.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.000
Pull up all the employee access records.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.400
Let's find out who's down there.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.400
What do you see?

14:42.000 --> 14:42.800
Workstations cleared.

14:46.300 --> 14:46.900
Hang on.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.800
Status report, operation Hawkeye, dated... today.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.500
Open it up.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.000
Nothing.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.900
The report's embedded.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.400
"Transport protocol enacted. Delivery on schedule."

15:21.900 --> 15:23.100
They moved the targeting device.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.800
"Scheduled to leave the country at 0600 hours."

15:27.900 --> 15:28.300
Okay.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.100
Let's see. Checking airfields and shipping yards.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.100
"Installation complete. Status -- field ready."

15:36.900 --> 15:37.800
My god.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.200
It's already weaponized.

15:44.500 --> 15:44.900
Syd?

15:49.300 --> 15:51.200
Syd? Syd, are you okay?

15:51.300 --> 15:54.600
Operation Hawkeye -- where's it being shipped out of?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.200
- Tell me.
- No.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.000
Sam Houser.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.600
Breach initiated by Sam Houser. Club level employee.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.400
All units, locate and detain him.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.800
Wasn't a yes or no question.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.900
The name of the shipping yard.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.500
Delongpre shipping.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
Syd, are you okay?

16:15.700 --> 16:16.500
We're going in.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.300
Let's get him.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.300
I'm okay.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.500
Be careful, okay?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.600
What do you have?

16:36.700 --> 16:38.100
Houser, Samuel David.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.600
Living for a half a year in Austria on a student visa.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.000
Odd jobs, owes money on some overdue movie rentals.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.900
Other than that, he's just a guy.

17:00.900 --> 17:01.400
Hey.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.700
Let's get out of here.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.700
Uh, but you said you had a boyfriend, and I thought --

17:05.800 --> 17:07.400
A girl can change her mind, right?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.800
Uh, I don't get off for like another hour,

17:10.900 --> 17:12.700
but you could wait for me at the bar or I --

17:12.800 --> 17:15.200
Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.000
If you don't leave with me right now, you will regret it.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.200
All right, well, we could slip out the back door.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.900
You took the words right out of my mouth.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.300
Go check over there.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.200
Delongpre shipping is 30 miles outside of Salzburg.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.100
I have an in-country contact.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.400
Use him. Have him supply you for the mission.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.700
We need to secure the weapon before it leaves port.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.000
If we cross over to Filton, I know a great wine bar.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.000
I'm sorry. I'm on the phone with my sister.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
Where's the phone?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.700
We have another situation. A civilian.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.800
Korjev's team tagged him as my accomplice. I can't leave him.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.400
Pass him off to your contact.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.800
We'll have him reestablished stateside by the weekend.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.100
That cell is insane.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.300
The guy at the store told me mine was the smallest,

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
but I knew he was jobbing me.

18:16.100 --> 18:16.900
Sam?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.000
Yeah?

18:18.100 --> 18:19.600
There's something I have to tell you.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.400
You're having second thoughts.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.300
It's not about that.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.800
If it's about your boyfriend, let me just say --

18:24.800 --> 18:25.900
Forget about the boyfriend.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.900
Well, maybe we could just go back to my place and talk then.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.300
It would be nice to have a normal conversation,

18:29.400 --> 18:30.100
if you don't mind a mess.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.600
- Sam.
- Yeah.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.900
You can never go back to your place.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.300
- What?
- Listen to me.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.900
Your bosses at the club are bad men.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I   was there tonight to stop them from doing a bad thing.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.000
Wait a minute. I'm --

18:45.100 --> 18:47.100
I needed your access card, and I took it.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.800
And now they think we work together.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.200
Work together?

18:50.300 --> 18:53.000
What about beef on --

18:56.200 --> 18:57.800
Who the hell are you?

18:57.900 --> 18:59.800
I need you to trust me right now.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.700
Oh, is that what you need?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.500
Okay, that's good, because

19:05.700 --> 19:08.400
I got to get back to work so I can get away from the mind games.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.200
Wait.

19:09.300 --> 19:12.700
If you go back there, they will kill you.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.400
You're serious?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
But if you stick with me, I promise I'll protect you.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.700
We have ways of handling these situations.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.900
Who's "we"?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.300
I can't tell you that.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.600
Hold on. You've already lied to me once.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.000
So how do I know that you're not one of the bad guys?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.600
If I was one of the bad guys,

19:33.300 --> 19:35.400
you'd already be dead.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.500
Thanks, Joe.

19:56.100 --> 20:00.500
Hi. I'm looking for someone. Frank Murdoch. Do you know him?

20:02.800 --> 20:03.800
Nope.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.400
Never heard of him.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.600
Well, this shop's registered to his name.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.700
What are you, a cop?

20:12.100 --> 20:14.800
No, it's a personal matter regarding my father.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.100
Tell you what.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.300
If ever you get your memory back,

20:20.900 --> 20:23.300
tell him Michael Vaughn's looking for him.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.600
That's my number. Thanks for your help.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.700
You're really Bill Vaughn's kid?

20:37.000 --> 20:37.700
Yeah.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.900
That's your dad in the middle.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.300
That's me on the right.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.600
Everyone else is dead.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.700
You think he's still alive?

20:50.200 --> 20:51.300
Well, I hope not.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.800
When was the last time you saw him?

20:55.700 --> 20:57.600
The Falkland conflict.

20:58.200 --> 21:03.300
We were supposed to lead a team of locals to secure a british position.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.800
Our men were ambushed.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.700
And Bill didn't even flinch.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.100
I broke command, charged in to defend our men,

21:12.400 --> 21:15.700
and the next thing I know, my legs went numb.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.500
He shot me in the back.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.000
I don't remember hitting the ground,

21:21.100 --> 21:25.100
but I remember lying there looking up at him completely paralyzed,

21:25.200 --> 21:29.800
and he just stared down at me, lit a cigarette,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.400
and walked away.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.000
That's the last I ever saw him.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.000
I can't believe that's true.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.500
Yeah, well, if he's still alive,

21:37.600 --> 21:40.200
I'll give you one piece of advice.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.800
Don't turn your back on him.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.200
Who are you calling?

21:55.400 --> 21:58.500
Oh, right, right, right. Sorry. My bad.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.700
Good evening.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.600
Phoenix inquiring about a late-night snack.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.200
And how many will we be serving?

22:05.400 --> 22:08.100
Two. One house special, the other will be ordering off the menu.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.900
When will you be joining us?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.300
As soon as possible.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.100
I'll make sure the table is ready.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.200
Thank you.

22:20.000 --> 22:20.500
Let me guess.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.800
That wasn't a real restaurant.

22:25.500 --> 22:25.900
Hello?

22:26.100 --> 22:27.700
I'll have them for you shortly.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.500
Good. I assure you, mr. Tauber,

22:30.600 --> 22:33.700
Sasha Korjev will be made aware of your allegiance.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.300
That is all I ask.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
I'm looking for the Rug Merchant.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.000
His shop is sixty kilometers up the Bantu River.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.800
When are they coming?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.300
It should be soon, Sam.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.400
I'm not stupid, okay?

24:06.600 --> 24:09.400
I understand what happens in the witness protection program.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.500
I get shipped off to some boring suburb.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.300
They pick a name right out of the episcopalian registry.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.500
I don't get to see my family anymore.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.600
You think my mother's gonna be able to handle that?

24:23.700 --> 24:26.500
When I know everything's safe, I'll let her know you're okay.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.100
You know what the real pisser of this whole thing is?

24:31.900 --> 24:35.800
Is I came here to pump some thunder through my veins.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.400
Try to find some inspiration,

24:38.500 --> 24:40.400
maybe take a shot at writing something.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.100
Didn't happen.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
Just...

24:46.800 --> 24:48.300
drank a lot of beer.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.200
Here we go.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.800
Agent Bristow. So good to see you again.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
Is this the cargo?

25:07.300 --> 25:09.500
This is Sam. Yeah.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.900
We'll have him whitewashed within the hour.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.800
Come, please. No worries. Your supplies are in the vehicle.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.500
You have a weapon for me?

25:25.600 --> 25:26.500
Of course, my dear.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.600
But let's get out of the cold first, hmm?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.900
We need to get out of here. We're not safe.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.200
I'm not going anywhere with you.

25:55.300 --> 25:58.700
Sam, take my hand. We have to go.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.700
Look at what you did to him.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.300
We just got blindsided, and we dealt with it.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.600
That doesn't meanwe give up. It doesn't change who we are.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.300
I'm on your side.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.300
I'm not gonna lie to you, Sam.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.100
I'm not gonna have the supplies I was counting on.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.000
I can't promise you how this thing is gonna turn out.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.900
You don't have backup?

26:17.100 --> 26:18.000
I'm it.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.800
I need you to think.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.400
Do you know any back ways to the Delongpre shipping yards?

26:23.900 --> 26:28.200
I mean -- yeah, you could take the metro. Why?

26:30.300 --> 26:32.900
The people who are after us have a weapon they shouldn't have.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.800
I want to take it from them before they use it and people die.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.100
Let's go to the metro.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.600
Hey, hold on.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.100
You do understand that I don't have any skills...

26:51.500 --> 26:52.800
in the physical sense.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.200
It's okay. I got you.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.000
Come on. Come on.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.600
This is your stop.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.900
Remove his hood.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.900
Untie his hands.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.900
Did this man carry identification?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.100
Yes, sir.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.900
And do you know who he is?

27:24.500 --> 27:25.100
Sir, I --

27:25.400 --> 27:26.000
I didn't --

27:28.500 --> 27:31.900
You strike this man, you strike me in the heart. Understand?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.600
Jack, my dear friend.

27:40.500 --> 27:41.400
Hello, Sasha.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
I apologize for that scene outside.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.300
I've always remembered what you taught me --

27:50.100 --> 27:51.700
treat your men like children.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.400
Give them rope to become their own men.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.200
But if they make mistakes,

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
hang them with it.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.100
I'd say my lessons have served you well.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.800
I'd ask how you managed to find me, but I know you too well.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.100
You can rest assured, you're well insulated.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.600
I do what is necessary to stay alive.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.300
After all, I don't have you or the CIA to watch my back anymore.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.600
I must say, I was shocked at how abruptly our association ended.

28:19.900 --> 28:23.400
One day we are working together, arming a rebellion.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.300
The next, you're gone.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.800
My mandate changed.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.400
Yet here you are.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.000
Why are you here, Jack?

28:36.400 --> 28:39.200
I'm entering the private sector.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.200
Now that I'm out from under their watchful eye, I was hoping

28:42.400 --> 28:44.200
we could talk business.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.900
It would be my honor to work with you.

28:52.000 --> 28:52.600
Excuse me.

28:56.100 --> 28:56.700
Yes?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.800
The delivery of the package is proceeding on schedule.

29:00.100 --> 29:00.900
Keep me posted.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.400
Jack, I want to show you my zoo.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.900
It was a dusty ride.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.800
Of course. Forgive me.

29:13.500 --> 29:17.800
I have an 18-year-old single malt that should remedy that, huh?

29:17.900 --> 29:18.700
Excellent.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.200
Jack, I'd like you to meet my wife.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.500
Lani.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.000
- Pleasure.
- The Jack?

29:34.100 --> 29:35.200
The one.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.400
Then the pleasure is all mine.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.000
I hope you'll be staying a while.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.700
I'd like to get to know the man my husband talks about.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.100
That's very kind, but I'm not certain how long I can stay.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.800
Well, dinner at least.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.400
I'll see that the staff prepare something wonderful.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.000
Truly, it's so good to finally meet you.

29:53.200 --> 29:53.900
You too.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.800
I need to steal Sasha from you just a moment.

29:58.000 --> 29:58.800
Certainly.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.900
Make yourself comfortable in my office. First door on the right.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.000
Can you tell what it is?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.700
UAV assault chopper.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.900
It's kind of small.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.500
- They customized it.
- What?

31:18.600 --> 31:21.200
The biometric targeting system -- it's in the chopper.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.700
Once that thing locks onto its target, there's no hiding.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.400
So that thing kills people?

31:30.300 --> 31:34.300
- Can you drive this thing?
- Yeah.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.500
Remember whan you said you wanted to pump some thunder into your veins?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.100
You're about to get your chance.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.200
I'll get the weapon.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.800
You drive the van into the warehouse.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.200
Pick me up in three minutes.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.600
Don't touch that. I'll be in my office.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.700
You can do this, Sam.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.900
Just... stay cool, man.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.800
- Get in.
- Here. Take this.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.500
Get down! Stay inside!

35:13.700 --> 35:14.400
I missed.

35:15.700 --> 35:16.500
I noticed.

35:18.600 --> 35:22.300
That guy was my boss, and he shot me.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.900
- It doesn't hurt.
- It will soon.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.700
Oh. Oh.

35:30.700 --> 35:31.800
We did it, huh?

35:32.800 --> 35:33.800
We saved the world.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.800
Something like that.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.300
She's lovely your wife.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.100
Indeed. We just found out -- she's pregnant.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.400
Congratulations.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.500
I'll be honest with you.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.600
When we first saw the heartbeat, I was scared.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.900
I thought, what kind of a father will I be?

36:01.800 --> 36:04.100
But seeing you here, I'm reminded

36:04.200 --> 36:08.200
of the tools you've given me, the tools of being a man.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.600
I gave you the tools. You chose how to use them.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.700
There was a time, Jack,

36:20.900 --> 36:23.300
when we were both working for the higher purpose

36:24.000 --> 36:26.100
but our goals were not the same.

36:26.500 --> 36:30.300
That became clear when you and your agency decided to abandon me.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.500
I realized on that day how naive I'd been.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.200
I had no option but to pick myself up,

36:37.300 --> 36:38.200
stay on course,

36:38.900 --> 36:41.400
because that is the man you taught me to be.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.100
I know there are some in your government that see my business as a form of betrayal --

36:53.800 --> 36:57.000
You betrayed me.

37:16.300 --> 37:20.000
Mr Korjev asked not to be distirbed. He'll be out shortly.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.200
I need a car. I need to go to town.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.100
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.100
When did you get back?

37:32.300 --> 37:33.400
About an hour ago.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.300
Did you find Murdoch?

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
Nah, I couldn't track him down.

37:38.700 --> 37:39.600
Ready?

37:39.700 --> 37:40.500
We should go.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.300
We're going to the movies. Want to come?

37:42.700 --> 37:44.400
Oh. No, thanks. Not tonight.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.300
Is it important? We don't have to go.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.500
Oh, no. No, no. You guys go. I'll see you tomorrow.

37:53.000 --> 37:53.800
All right.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.300
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.700
Hey.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.500
I spoke to my people,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.000
they spoke to people.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.000
It's safe for you to go back home.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.200
I think I'm done here.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.900
It's time for me to move on.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.600
Must kill you.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.100
Get to do all these crazy things

38:45.300 --> 38:47.600
and see all these amazing places.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.500
You gotta keep it to yourself.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
You know what? It's not so bad.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.500
It gives people like us something in common.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.000
"People like us," huh?

39:18.100 --> 39:18.900
Hey.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.600
I'll see you around the globe.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.400
Goodbye, Sam.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.600
Hey Dad! I heard you located Korjev.

39:46.000 --> 39:46.900
Yes, I did.

39:47.100 --> 39:49.700
Sloane said he was taken in a standoff. Were you there?

39:50.500 --> 39:52.100
I saw it play out.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.400
Heading home?

39:56.300 --> 39:57.800
Yeah, I'm gonna grab some dinner first.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.400
Okay.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.000
- Good night.
- Godd night.

40:07.200 --> 40:07.900
Dad!

40:10.600 --> 40:12.300
I'm kind of hungry myself --

40:12.900 --> 40:14.700
if you wouldn't mind the company.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.300
What about your report?

40:17.800 --> 40:18.800
It'll keep.
