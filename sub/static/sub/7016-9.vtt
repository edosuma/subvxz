WEBVTT

00:02.594 --> 00:06.176
No I get the top drawer, I've always had the
top drawer and this conversation is over !

00:06.211 --> 00:07.679
Don't you walk
away from me !

00:07.703 --> 00:10.584
I walk wherever I want ! Oh look,
I'm gonna walk on the couch !

00:10.607 --> 00:12.345
Oh yeah ?! Well,

00:13.390 --> 00:15.703
I'm gonna drink the
rest of your last beer !

00:18.721 --> 00:20.951
I win. I put out a
cigarette in there.

00:24.991 --> 00:27.116
What is going on with you
and your stripper wife ?

00:28.145 --> 00:30.246
You guys are fighting
like cats and whores.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.863
Yep. The honeymoon is over.

00:34.217 --> 00:37.452
You know, once the thrill being
married to a stripper is gone,

00:37.552 --> 00:40.568
you're just left with a wife
who's always got change for a five.

00:42.748 --> 00:43.784
You guys,

00:44.888 --> 00:48.898
the radio station asked me to host an
on-air fundraiser for the Children's Library.

00:49.005 --> 00:53.781
A year ago I was doing the Farm Report and
now it's gonna be Hot Donna all day long.

00:54.917 --> 00:59.011
That's right. I'm gonna be referring to
myself in the third person from now on.

01:00.485 --> 01:03.311
Wait. You're not doing
the Farm Report anymore ?

01:04.224 --> 01:07.631
Well how am I supposed to
know if my corns-a-gonna grow ?

01:08.905 --> 01:13.610
And I told my boss, that I'm not getting
off the air until I've raised 500 bucks.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.773
Which'll be easy, because
my fans do anything I say.

01:16.836 --> 01:22.092
Like, there was this one time, when I told everybody to
get up and dance when I played Tear The Roof Off The Sucker.

01:22.196 --> 01:24.321
There was almost a
riot at the prison !

01:26.077 --> 01:30.581
Yeah. Thanks a lot Donna. My
Dad had to hide under his bunk.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.910
Hyde, thanks for letting
us broadcast from Grooves.

01:36.037 --> 01:39.212
We couldn't do it at the Children's
Library, because the last time I was there,

01:39.246 --> 01:41.472
this ten year old boy
got a peek down my shirt

01:41.496 --> 01:45.612
and his mom had to read him "What's happening
to my body" three years earlier then she planned.

01:46.935 --> 01:49.512
And well, now I'm
not welcome back.

01:50.598 --> 01:52.982
Wait a second, you guys
are doing this at my store ?

01:53.528 --> 01:55.232
Where was I when
this was decided ?

01:55.277 --> 01:57.641
At work. We just
didn't want to wake you.

02:01.006 --> 02:02.821
I cleared all your
crap off the bed.

02:02.865 --> 02:06.110
- Why the hell did you do that ?
- Because...we're gonna use it to make up !

02:06.347 --> 02:08.571
Unless you wanna...make
up in the shower...

02:11.197 --> 02:12.652
Honeymoon's back on !

02:20.935 --> 02:21.663
Oh.

02:22.447 --> 02:23.562
It's you.

02:25.768 --> 02:26.680
Fenton.

02:28.476 --> 02:33.233
During business hours you may address
me by my official title "Landlord".

02:33.547 --> 02:35.870
I'll also respond
to "Lord Fenton".

02:36.775 --> 02:39.250
Oeh, or on Sundays,
"The Good Lord".

02:41.658 --> 02:42.701
Yeeeesss...

02:44.386 --> 02:46.433
Fenton, I am in no
mood to talk to you.

02:46.455 --> 02:47.802
Oh well then just listen.

02:48.147 --> 02:51.193
I did a little shuffle-y-doo
with the parking lot assignments.

02:51.238 --> 02:54.280
Your new space... is Z.

02:57.077 --> 02:57.942
Z ?

02:58.405 --> 02:59.811
Z's the last spot.

03:01.826 --> 03:03.781
It's dangerous to walk
from there at night.

03:07.966 --> 03:09.422
I'm a single man.

03:11.206 --> 03:14.562
Well, maybe you should put some
effort into your appearance.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.683
Maybe you should put some effort
into minding your own business !

03:16.717 --> 03:18.500
- Maybe you should shut up !
- Maybe you should go to hell !

03:18.525 --> 03:20.100
I'll go to hell
when you shut up !

03:24.338 --> 03:27.003
Damn. I really should have turned
in the direction of my door.

03:33.608 --> 03:34.862
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

03:39.377 --> 03:41.541
Hey Fezzie !
How's the salon ?

03:41.878 --> 03:46.032
Horrible. An old lady and a marine came
in at the same time. I got confused.

03:47.337 --> 03:50.591
And well, Mrs. Riley was not
happy when I shaved her head.

03:54.615 --> 03:56.892
Yeah I know. I had
a tough day too.

03:56.927 --> 04:00.151
General Hospital is pre-empted
by some stupid hostage crisis.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.681
Did you drink my
last grape soda ?!

04:07.216 --> 04:11.131
Yeah. I left the empty bottle in the
fridge, so you'd know to buy more.

04:12.855 --> 04:15.653
But I'd been looking forward
to this grape soda all day !

04:16.267 --> 04:18.242
I even made up a song.

04:19.587 --> 04:23.073
I'm looking forward to
that grape soda. Yeah !

04:25.036 --> 04:25.911
Jackie,

04:26.267 --> 04:29.831
I took you in when you had nowhere
to go. But you've been a total mooch.

04:29.865 --> 04:33.952
You have no job, you pay no rent.
You need to shape up or put out.

04:36.136 --> 04:39.453
Uhh Fez it's shape
up or ship out.

04:40.308 --> 04:41.672
Then what the hell
is in it for me ?

04:45.175 --> 04:48.401

You know I hate it when you read the paper
while I'm sitting right here next to you !

05:27.425 --> 05:30.041
Yeah. That's why I'm
doing it, honey-bunch.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.693
Why don't you read your horoscope ? I
bet it says You won't be getting any !

05:38.657 --> 05:40.381
Oh, here is my horoscope.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.702
You'll find yourself
living with a bitch !

05:50.868 --> 05:52.212
You know why
they're fighting ?

05:52.985 --> 05:57.213
Because they're packed into Steven's tiny
room like sardines. And that's no way to be.

05:57.275 --> 06:00.013
Unless you are a sardine and
then you've got bigger problems.

06:00.878 --> 06:04.570
I think I see where you are going with this
Kitty. You kick 'm out and I'll change the locks.

06:05.437 --> 06:08.761
No ! They should move into Laurie's
old room. It's just sitting there.

06:08.795 --> 06:11.591
Kitty, 'it's just sitting there'
is a reason to shoot a deer.

06:11.628 --> 06:14.451
Not a reason to move
two kids in next door.

06:15.548 --> 06:20.482
Oh you're just upset because you don't want
people seeing you in your big green fuzzy slippers.

06:22.818 --> 06:25.003
Those are my Green
Bay Packers-slippers.

06:26.796 --> 06:29.160
And they looked a lot
sharper in the catalog...

06:33.708 --> 06:35.261
Okay, Hot Donna fans !

06:35.305 --> 06:38.683
I'm here at Grooves-records raising
money for the Children's Library.

06:38.707 --> 06:42.540
And I'm not getting off the
air until my jug is full !

06:46.908 --> 06:50.083
We have our first donation.
Sir, how much did you give us ?

06:50.117 --> 06:51.973
Um... 68 cents.

06:53.127 --> 06:56.490
Alright. And ah, how did you
come into that kind of cash ?

06:56.865 --> 06:59.081
I bought something
that costs 32 cents.

07:01.285 --> 07:04.112
Terrific ! Hey,
here's a fun fact:

07:04.278 --> 07:08.232
money is covered in germs and
human waste, so give it to me !

07:09.538 --> 07:13.910
Pop in your cars, your trucks, your
speed wagons and come on down to Grooves.

07:13.948 --> 07:18.291
Speaking of speed wagons, here
is a new song from...The Cars !

07:19.485 --> 07:22.213
Hey after this song, do you think
I can do one of my characters ?

07:22.245 --> 07:25.202
I do a really great British
boy, trapped in an elevator.

07:25.415 --> 07:29.171
Please sir, I'm stuck in the
lift and I 'of to use the looooo !

07:36.838 --> 07:40.430
Okay...it's been
two hours...and I'm..

07:40.936 --> 07:42.603
nowhere near my goal.

07:43.938 --> 07:48.373
Um, I understand that some of my
fans can't make it here because, well,

07:48.416 --> 07:49.703
you're in prison.

07:51.496 --> 07:54.722
But for those of you who
aren't: rob a bank or something !

07:55.645 --> 08:00.260
Just kidding ! Uh..WFPP in no way
endorses the robbing of banks !

08:03.798 --> 08:06.151
I think what you're
doing here is great, man.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.560
Thanks, Leo.

08:09.588 --> 08:12.370
Yeah, we haven't had a
trash can here in ages.

08:18.625 --> 08:23.243
Oh yeah Fenton ? Well if I could do that to myself,
I wouldn't be standing here arguing with you !

08:28.607 --> 08:29.443
Wow !

08:29.806 --> 08:31.880
This place is spotless !

08:33.938 --> 08:35.760
I can see my reflection !

08:36.645 --> 08:38.633
Why hello Robert Redford !

08:39.677 --> 08:42.071
Well Fez, I realized
what you said was true.

08:42.105 --> 08:45.363
That I needed to help
out. So..I cleaned.

08:45.617 --> 08:49.282
Hm. I guess all the years of watching
my maid scrub the floor really paid off.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.551
Well, thank you Jackie.
You deserve a big night out.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.842
I'm taking you to
the Muppet movie.

08:55.857 --> 09:00.323
Hahaha ! No thanks Fez. I'm actually running the
bath and I'm gonna spend all night soaking in the tub.

09:00.355 --> 09:02.151
Okay, well then
let's do that then.

09:04.515 --> 09:05.723
Alone !

09:05.948 --> 09:08.120
Fine. But I'm still
going to the movies.

09:08.146 --> 09:11.381
I think Miss Piggy and Kermit
are finally going to doooo iiiiit.

09:43.498 --> 09:45.313
Why the hell did
you turn the TV on ?!

09:45.335 --> 09:47.492
To drown out your snoring !

09:47.655 --> 09:50.681
I was snoring to drown
out your talking !

09:51.885 --> 09:52.780
Okay.

09:53.895 --> 09:56.432
I can't put up with those
two fighting anymore.

09:56.468 --> 09:58.923
It's like living with
a couple of Italians !

10:01.416 --> 10:02.390
Oh yeah.

10:03.127 --> 10:07.833
We moved two fighting morons into an
adjacent room and now we can't sleep.

10:09.585 --> 10:11.413
Who could have
seen this coming...

10:17.676 --> 10:19.160
Hot Donna here.

10:19.345 --> 10:22.060
Heading into my
12th hour on the air.

10:23.988 --> 10:28.803
Our top news story: I've raised
38 dollars and my ass is asleep !

10:31.278 --> 10:35.000
I guess what I'm trying to say is:
where the hell are all my fans ?

10:36.018 --> 10:38.052
Yeah, I know you're
home listening.

10:38.088 --> 10:41.693
I've signed enough of your bellies
to know you're not out on dates !

10:43.178 --> 10:45.122
You know what.
Just forget it.

10:45.152 --> 10:48.198
I'll find my own change,
you cheap bastards

10:49.838 --> 10:50.694
Donna, what are you doing ?!

10:50.728 --> 10:53.018
I'm looking for
change man, back off !

10:54.575 --> 10:56.501
I wouldn't stick
your hand in there.

10:56.538 --> 10:59.733
Sometimes when Leo doesn't finish
his lunch, he puts it in his pockets.

10:59.968 --> 11:02.002
He eats a lot of ravioli !

11:03.048 --> 11:05.423
Hey are you stealing
my raviolis ?

11:12.347 --> 11:14.431
Okay, listen up
you tightwads.

11:15.018 --> 11:19.043
I can't go home till I've raised 500
bucks. So, this is how it's gonna work.

11:19.476 --> 11:22.042
Donate a quarter: I'll
take a picture with you.

11:22.316 --> 11:24.781
Drop in a dollar:
I'll sign your butt.

11:25.615 --> 11:29.970
Anybody who donates 50 bucks: I'll
take off my clothes and show you stuff !

11:43.108 --> 11:45.351
Hm. I've never made
that sound before.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.571
Jackie ! What ?!
What's going on ?

11:49.605 --> 11:51.512
You flooded the apartment !

11:51.698 --> 11:52.503
What ?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.483
Ohhh I must have fallen
asleep with the tub running.

11:55.516 --> 11:57.721
Oh I bet all the
hot water is gone.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.173
It soaked into the
carpet and into the floor.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.440
Well who lives downstairs ?

12:12.048 --> 12:13.860
Oh ! Entrez !

12:16.836 --> 12:18.543
Oh. It's you.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.692
What do you want ?

12:20.758 --> 12:23.951
Uhm, we're just here to
borrow some sugar neighbor...

12:24.235 --> 12:28.052
I don't have any. You can't
eat sugar and keep this figure.

12:28.526 --> 12:29.900
Then we'll go...

12:30.187 --> 12:32.292
cause everything
here looks...

12:32.496 --> 12:33.652
ship-shape.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.791
Goodnight then !

12:49.756 --> 12:50.943
This is terrible.

12:51.008 --> 12:53.593
Your apartment is ruined, water
is still pouring into mine.

12:53.627 --> 12:57.160
I'm gonna have to walk around in a
big rubber suit. If it still fits !

12:58.746 --> 13:00.230
Fenton, I know it looks bad,

13:00.257 --> 13:03.623
but according to the commercial one roll
of Bounty should take care of everything.

13:05.728 --> 13:09.142
You're gonna pay for the carpet,
the floor, and my damaged ceiling.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.861
How am I supposed to
find that kind of money ?

13:11.897 --> 13:15.862
Well you always seem to find money
for those tacky tight pants you wear.

13:16.577 --> 13:19.423
- You wish your pants were tight !
- You wish your pants were loose !

13:19.465 --> 13:21.191
- Toothpick-legs ! -
Salt-sticks-thighs !

13:21.227 --> 13:22.182
Get out !

13:28.227 --> 13:29.902
You. Pack your bags.

13:30.297 --> 13:32.482
Fez ! That's a great idea !

13:32.507 --> 13:34.763
Let's go to Bermuda while
this place dries out.

13:36.976 --> 13:39.020
You pushed it too
far. I want you out.

13:40.346 --> 13:41.440
Wait, what ?

13:41.886 --> 13:43.811
Fez, where am I
supposed to go ?

13:43.946 --> 13:47.263
Oh, how about this, why don't you
go down to "I Don't Care" Street,

13:47.296 --> 13:51.901
make a left on "Get Out Of My Life" Boulevard,
and take the express bus to downtown "Suck It" !

13:58.036 --> 14:01.732
Samantha, Red and I both
felt we needed to talk to you.

14:02.306 --> 14:04.342
Steven, Kitty is
making me talk to you.

14:06.015 --> 14:09.830
We're worried that you two aren't
communicating the way a couple should.

14:09.877 --> 14:13.333
We're sick of you screaming at each
other like a couple of dumbasses.

14:17.238 --> 14:20.343
Red, what happens between
me and Sam is kinda private.

14:20.388 --> 14:22.043
I'll tell you anything.

14:22.715 --> 14:24.813
Hyde and I are
like an open book.

14:25.277 --> 14:27.473
Oh Red and I share
everything too.

14:28.105 --> 14:30.763
Except bars of soap,
it's unsanitary.

14:32.556 --> 14:34.730
Well I gotta tell
Kitty something.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.453
You two are gonna
stop fighting ?

14:37.076 --> 14:39.223
Er. You see the thing is...

14:39.395 --> 14:42.112
Fighting gets Hyde and
me all worked up and...

14:42.146 --> 14:43.783
.. after we fight...we...

14:44.496 --> 14:45.251
well...

14:46.108 --> 14:46.753
you know.

14:46.897 --> 14:49.420
We get naked and
have hot crazy sex.

14:51.126 --> 14:53.710
Good God I didn't need
to hear about that !

14:53.877 --> 14:56.682
Holy Toledo, tell
me more about that !

14:58.565 --> 14:59.982
So you're saying...

15:00.017 --> 15:03.761
You put up with the fighting
to spice up your s. e. x. ?

15:04.606 --> 15:05.712
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

15:05.847 --> 15:08.031
You two are naughty !

15:10.787 --> 15:12.442
You two are idiots !

15:21.148 --> 15:25.503
Fenton ! I'm so glad I caught you look
this whole mess is my fault and not Fez's.

15:25.547 --> 15:28.263
I'm the one who ran the
bath, I flooded the place,

15:28.297 --> 15:31.752
I ruined your creepy night of
classical music and Indian food.

15:31.985 --> 15:36.490
Well, you also ruined this.
My beautiful pig-suede jacket.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.863
Oooohhh, from China ?!

15:39.726 --> 15:41.851
Ohhh it's beautiful.

15:42.526 --> 15:46.211
And versatile. You can wear it
as a jacket or a sportcoat or

15:46.247 --> 15:49.182
you can wrap it around your waist
when you're having a big-butt day.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.131
Fenton, please let me
make this up to you.

15:52.155 --> 15:54.962
I know a great place we can
get an even better jacket.

15:54.998 --> 15:57.880
It may not be suede and
it may not be from China,

15:57.916 --> 16:00.722
but I'm neither of those things
and I'm a better person for it.

16:02.955 --> 16:04.620
Well it'd better
be good stuff.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.812
Cheap leather makes me rashy
in all the wrong places.

16:09.517 --> 16:10.993
What are the right places ?

16:14.085 --> 16:15.781
I have said too much...

16:23.875 --> 16:25.331
Hello Donna.

16:27.798 --> 16:29.223
Santa Klaus ?

16:30.838 --> 16:32.220
Am I having a dream ?

16:32.257 --> 16:35.152
No Donna. This is
really happening.

16:35.388 --> 16:36.880
What are you doing here ?

16:36.915 --> 16:40.021
Well I've come to fill
your jug. With change.

16:40.067 --> 16:44.733
So that you can help build that library
for all the good little boys and girls.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.043
Wow !

16:46.587 --> 16:47.931
Thanks Santa.

16:48.506 --> 16:51.370
And to think everyone
said you weren't real.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.272
Who ? I'll kill those
little bastards ! I...

16:55.968 --> 16:58.770
I mean... who ?

17:02.508 --> 17:03.221
Donna ?

17:03.288 --> 17:06.271
Don't kill them Santa !
Please don't kill them !

17:07.458 --> 17:10.492
Whoo Donna, calm
down. It's me, Randy.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.260
I brought change.

17:14.506 --> 17:15.492
My nana,

17:16.017 --> 17:18.060
God rest that
sweet woman's soul,

17:18.546 --> 17:20.602
gave me this bank
when I was just a boy.

17:21.244 --> 17:22.711
She didn't have much but

17:22.757 --> 17:25.801
every time she came over
she told me to close my eyes

17:25.867 --> 17:27.781
and she'd drop a
silver dollar in here.

17:28.865 --> 17:29.980
I want you to have it.

17:31.018 --> 17:34.012
My God Randy, you
are so awesome.

17:39.618 --> 17:40.750
Pennies ?!

17:41.148 --> 17:42.742
Thanks a lot nana !

17:42.765 --> 17:47.401
I guess all your real money must have gone to
Jack Daniels and slot-machines, you lying old hag !

17:49.326 --> 17:50.843
Randy don't worry about it.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.022
I mean at least you tried.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.971
Yeah well, I'd like to
do what I can to help.

17:55.995 --> 17:58.412
Because I care about
the Children's Library.

17:58.865 --> 18:00.792
You hear that Point Place ?

18:01.055 --> 18:04.553
Randy Pearson
loves little boys !

18:14.995 --> 18:20.362
Okay well, Steven and Samantha are moving back
downstairs because they're not gonna stop fighting.

18:20.386 --> 18:22.041
And you know why ?

18:25.246 --> 18:27.892
Yes, unfortunately I do.

18:27.926 --> 18:30.692
What kind of person has
to argue in order to...

18:31.356 --> 18:32.241
you know.

18:33.016 --> 18:35.940
Well what's wrong with it if
it spices up their lovemaking ?

18:35.986 --> 18:39.573
Oh Jeez Kitty is that what we're
doing ? We're just saying it now ?

18:41.175 --> 18:43.331
Well you never want
to talk about anything.

18:43.358 --> 18:45.360
And you always do.

18:45.405 --> 18:48.673
I can't get any peace
unless I leave the room.

18:48.898 --> 18:52.242
And even then I have to run the
lawnmower in the garage in order to

18:52.275 --> 18:55.012
not hear your
constant jammering.

18:55.045 --> 18:55.962
Red Forman !

18:55.995 --> 18:59.630
Ahh speechless huh ? Well
it's about damn time !

19:03.398 --> 19:05.911
I thought we were
uhm trying this... ?

19:08.967 --> 19:09.652
Oooooooooohhh !

19:14.656 --> 19:18.233
Jackie I had such a
great time with you.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.662
I got a new jacket,
a manicure, crepes.

19:21.698 --> 19:24.012
I didn't know a woman
could be so into that stuff.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.801
I know. Fenton, I had such
a great time with you too.

19:28.607 --> 19:29.301
Well.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.712
If it isn't Jackie.

19:32.278 --> 19:35.041
There's only one person I hate more
than Jackie, and that is Fenton.

19:37.257 --> 19:39.480
And Fenton, there's only one
person I hate more than you:

19:39.686 --> 19:40.913
Queen Elizabeth.

19:43.076 --> 19:45.430
Who does she think she
is ? Queen of England ?

19:47.766 --> 19:49.763
Well don't worry Fez.
Cause I'm leaving tonight.

19:49.788 --> 19:52.201
Wowho, you're leaving ?!

19:52.238 --> 19:56.091
Yeah she's leaving. She destroyed my
apartment, she is costing me a fortune !

19:56.428 --> 19:58.971
Jackie I... I can't
let you go. I mean,

19:59.656 --> 20:03.291
you have the other half of my
"Best Friends Forever" heart-charm !

20:05.616 --> 20:07.990
Well Fenton,
I'd love to stay.

20:08.176 --> 20:12.542
But as all good friendships require,
you're gonna have to do something for me.
