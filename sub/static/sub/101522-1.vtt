04:30.430 --> 04:32.399
Jacko!

04:32.432 --> 04:33.967
What is all this about?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.235
Don't even go there, mate.

04:35.268 --> 04:37.070
It's almost become
like a tradition now.

04:37.103 --> 04:39.072
It's the old festive Christmas
Eve hunt, isn't it?

04:39.105 --> 04:41.208
Well, yeah, you've certainly
gone all out this year.

04:41.241 --> 04:42.475
You've even got the beard
and everything!

04:42.509 --> 04:43.876
Oh, don't worry about that.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.478
That'll be gone
by dinner time.

04:45.512 --> 04:47.380
- Why?
- Cassie hates it.

04:48.114 --> 04:49.216
She's got a point, mate.

04:49.249 --> 04:51.817
Not you and all.
I like it!

04:51.850 --> 04:53.320
I see you've had a bit of luck
this year, though?

04:53.353 --> 04:54.955
These are beauties, mate.
Look at them.

04:54.988 --> 04:57.123
I caught the little bastards
right off-guard!

04:57.490 --> 04:58.857
You caught them off-guard?

04:59.960 --> 05:02.262
It's hard to imagine you
catching anything off-guard!

05:03.396 --> 05:04.231
Don't worry, though.

05:04.264 --> 05:05.864
There'll be plenty for you
and Lucy.

05:05.898 --> 05:07.367
7:30 alright
for the pair of you, still?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.102
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll be there.

05:09.135 --> 05:11.504
Means I can dump my share
of Cassie's God-awful stuffing

05:11.538 --> 05:13.006
right on your plate.

05:14.441 --> 05:16.409
So what's in yours then,
snoopy?

05:17.177 --> 05:18.411
- Now, this.
- Yeah?

05:18.445 --> 05:19.980
This is a surprise.

05:20.013 --> 05:20.913
Fair enough.

05:20.947 --> 05:22.915
Well, I better get dinner
plucked, stuffed

05:22.949 --> 05:24.284
- and ready for later.
- Mm-hmm.

05:24.317 --> 05:25.986
- Catch you later.
- See you later.

05:27.387 --> 05:28.455
Hey!

05:28.488 --> 05:31.091
Don't forget to leave plenty
of room on your plate.

05:31.124 --> 05:32.325
Will do!

06:09.596 --> 06:11.164
Babes!

06:11.197 --> 06:13.099
The one and only.

06:15.935 --> 06:17.203
Oh, it's Christmas!

06:17.237 --> 06:18.204
Almost.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.074
I missed you.

06:21.107 --> 06:23.476
I missed you, too,
you crazy Christmas puppy.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.415
Work sucked.

06:28.448 --> 06:29.882
I know.

06:30.116 --> 06:31.451
Yeah, and you?

06:32.285 --> 06:34.187
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

06:34.220 --> 06:36.889
- Not sick of the little brats then yet?
- Never!

06:36.922 --> 06:40.093
- I love the idea of seeing them grow into little people.
- Aww.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.096
Even more so,
over time

06:43.129 --> 06:45.432
I get to share my wisdom
with them.

06:45.465 --> 06:47.067
You're adorable.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.469
But I give it to
the end of January

06:49.502 --> 06:51.837
and you'll be back down
the job center.

06:56.409 --> 06:58.311
So, why are you still
wearing your hat?

07:00.547 --> 07:02.615
- Yeah, about that...
- Yeah?

07:04.617 --> 07:06.653
Remember when you
said ages ago

07:06.686 --> 07:08.254
that you wanted to see
what I looked like

07:08.288 --> 07:10.256
- with blonde hair, hmm?
- Yeah.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.325
And I said I wouldn't do it
because it was stupid.

07:12.359 --> 07:13.493
Yeah.

07:14.561 --> 07:17.063
Well, I thought I'd
surprise you for Christmas.

07:18.365 --> 07:19.865
But it's gone wrong!

07:22.001 --> 07:24.337
Alright, yeah yeah yeah,
that's enough.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.139
- Laugh at Jack.
- No, no, no, it's not,

07:26.172 --> 07:27.674
it's not that bad.

07:27.707 --> 07:28.641
- You can be...
- Really?

07:28.675 --> 07:33.680
...my little silver freak.

07:33.713 --> 07:35.648
We'll go with silver fox,
hmm?

07:37.283 --> 07:39.119
My silver fox.

07:47.026 --> 07:48.628
You make me really happy.

07:51.264 --> 07:52.932
Ok.

07:52.966 --> 07:54.667
What are you after?

07:57.337 --> 08:01.508
Ooh... Presents!

08:01.541 --> 08:03.476
No, no, no!

08:04.677 --> 08:06.112
Right.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.048
Uh...

08:10.683 --> 08:13.253
How am I supposed to know
which one mines is?

08:13.286 --> 08:15.221
Is, is, is, is?

08:15.255 --> 08:17.157
You haven't written any
names on it, you donut.

08:18.158 --> 08:20.427
These are for
the Hendersons.

08:23.997 --> 08:28.368
Oh, you little spoiled brat!

08:28.401 --> 08:30.036
You got the Hendersons
presents?

08:30.069 --> 08:32.539
Yes, I got the Hendersons
presents!

08:32.572 --> 08:33.740
Well, why wouldn't I?

08:33.773 --> 08:35.675
Because I got the Hendersons
presents.

08:35.708 --> 08:36.976
What?

08:37.010 --> 08:38.011
Where?

08:38.044 --> 08:39.145
Out in the hallway
in the bag

08:39.179 --> 08:40.280
that I asked you for
last night

08:40.313 --> 08:42.015
when I said "Can I have a bag
to put the presents in?"

08:42.048 --> 08:44.317
You never said
who they were for.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.552
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna get my old man

08:45.585 --> 08:47.187
a present, is it?

08:54.394 --> 08:55.495
"Bag in the hallway

08:55.528 --> 08:57.330
that you gave me last night."

09:06.739 --> 09:08.274
Show me then,
big spender.

09:08.308 --> 09:09.209
Alright.

09:09.242 --> 09:10.677
Sit, puppy.

09:15.048 --> 09:17.183
Right, close your eyes.

09:17.217 --> 09:18.318
Really?

09:18.351 --> 09:20.587
Where's the romance gone,
Lucy?

09:20.620 --> 09:21.754
Fair enough.

09:25.492 --> 09:28.261
Do I have to unwrap it with
my eyes closed, too, yeah?

09:28.294 --> 09:30.230
- It's up to you.
- Cool. Ok, ok.

09:30.263 --> 09:33.600
Ooh. Ooh.
It's quite solid.

09:33.633 --> 09:35.502
Oh, a book maybe?

09:35.535 --> 09:37.237
- Ok.
- Maybe.

09:48.114 --> 09:51.618
"To the best primary school
teacher in the world.

09:52.785 --> 09:54.654
"You've come so far
and I'm so proud

09:54.687 --> 09:57.223
"of everything you've achieved.

09:57.257 --> 09:59.359
"The kids are gonna love you.

10:00.126 --> 10:03.563
"Merry Christmas, all my love,

10:03.596 --> 10:05.131
Jack."

10:05.798 --> 10:07.133
That's you.

10:12.539 --> 10:14.741
You're amazing.

10:14.774 --> 10:17.644
I really wasn't expecting this.

10:18.845 --> 10:19.779
I mean it.

10:20.847 --> 10:22.348
I'm proud of you.

10:23.483 --> 10:24.417
I love you.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.585
I love you, too.

10:30.123 --> 10:32.525
Do we really
have to go over?

10:32.559 --> 10:37.130
No, but Michael's always
been so welcoming.

10:37.163 --> 10:38.798
It would be rude not to go,
you know that.

10:40.199 --> 10:43.236
Well, seeing as
we're doing this.

10:43.269 --> 10:44.437
Ooh.

10:46.139 --> 10:47.106
For you!

10:47.874 --> 10:49.242
Yeah, go on!

10:49.275 --> 10:50.476
Yeah!

11:02.288 --> 11:03.356
No note?

11:03.389 --> 11:06.125
Well, I didn't realize
you were gonna do all this!

11:08.361 --> 11:09.128
I'm guessing
you want me to wear

11:09.162 --> 11:11.164
this monstrosity tonight,
yeah?

11:11.197 --> 11:12.432
Yes!

11:27.447 --> 11:28.715
Happy?

11:37.423 --> 11:38.491
What?

11:39.525 --> 11:41.694
Jack, there's something
in the garden.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.131
What does it look like?

11:45.865 --> 11:48.635
Like two little torches.
Just moving.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.503
Little torches?
What, like borrower torches?

11:50.536 --> 11:51.604
No, Jack, I'm serious.

11:51.638 --> 11:52.405
Yeah, I know,

11:52.438 --> 11:54.574
but you're not making
any sense.

11:54.607 --> 11:58.845
- Look, I saw these two little lights.
- Whereabouts?

11:58.878 --> 12:00.747
The bottom.
There. Like, bottom right.

12:01.881 --> 12:03.349
Bottom right?

12:04.751 --> 12:06.653
- Lucy. Bottom right?
- Yeah. Like, just there,

12:06.686 --> 12:07.854
like two feet
from the bottom.

12:07.887 --> 12:08.956
Like, the bottom right.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.324
- Right, well, I'm going outside.
- No, no, no!

12:11.357 --> 12:13.793
Look, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

12:39.385 --> 12:40.553
<i>Be careful.</i>

15:07.867 --> 15:09.602
There's nothing there,
babe.

15:15.741 --> 15:17.443
The coast is clear.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.002
Luce?

15:45.838 --> 15:47.007
Lucy!

16:03.023 --> 16:04.457
Luce?

16:20.974 --> 16:22.475
Luce?

16:30.883 --> 16:32.119
Oh, my God, no!

16:36.689 --> 16:38.158
Lucy, calm down!
Lucy! Lucy!

16:38.191 --> 16:39.759
Lucy, calm down!

16:39.792 --> 16:41.794

Oh, babe! Lucy!

17:42.855 --> 17:43.889
You alright?

17:43.923 --> 17:45.025
Yeah.

17:45.058 --> 17:48.161
Is she...
Is she there?

17:48.195 --> 17:50.663
- What?
- Your mum. Is she there?

17:51.298 --> 17:52.765
Yeah, why?

18:00.639 --> 18:02.908
You're a funny guy.

18:06.179 --> 18:07.580
What you reading anyway,
Dad?

18:07.613 --> 18:09.515
Anything that makes me
look busy.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.588
Got it down to a tee,
I see?

18:15.621 --> 18:17.790
You'll learn from the best.

18:17.823 --> 18:19.658
Oh, yeah?
Who's that, then?

<i>in favor of a more pagan-like

<i>commemorating
the winter solstice.</i>

18:39.745 --> 18:42.315

<i>to acknowledge the light...</i>

18:45.684 --> 18:47.954
Well, go on then, old man!

18:49.356 --> 18:51.657
Eric, go and get your brother
and sister, will you?

18:51.690 --> 18:53.193

You're hiding away in here

19:37.736 --> 19:39.306
I'm sorry, Cass.

on my mind lately.

I don't think I can tell him.

Look, Michael,
we've talked about this.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.222
I've got nothing else
to say on the matter.

19:58.391 --> 20:03.964
Now, will you please help me
make dinner for your family?

20:06.166 --> 20:08.001
I'm sorry.
Come on, then.

20:08.034 --> 20:09.102
Let's go.

20:12.439 --> 20:13.940
Get up,
you big fat lump!

20:13.974 --> 20:16.343

- Oh, my sore knee.

20:16.376 --> 20:18.145
I know who needs one.

- I'm gonna have one of your spuds.
- Don't you dare!

- I'm gonna have two of your spuds!
- No, you don't!

20:21.448 --> 20:23.083
I'm gonna nick one
of your spuds!

20:29.189 --> 20:30.656

- Lauren?
- Just do it.

20:38.165 --> 20:39.266
But it's your go.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.701
Oh Ben, leave me alone
for one minute, would you?

20:43.903 --> 20:45.704
Sorry.

21:29.382 --> 21:31.784
<i>and I kinda just
want that with you.</i>

21:32.818 --> 21:34.054
<i>Babe?</i>

21:34.087 --> 21:35.222
<i>Lauren, you there?</i>

21:35.921 --> 21:37.357
You're so cute.

21:39.159 --> 21:41.528
I'm just confused
about it all.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.829
I don't know
if I even want this.

21:46.132 --> 21:50.170
I feel a bit suffocated
with everything.

21:51.271 --> 21:52.973
<i>Like what?</i>

21:54.107 --> 21:56.243
I just like things
the way they are.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.111
Don't you?

21:58.811 --> 22:00.547
<i>Of course I do, but...</i>

22:00.580 --> 22:02.949
<i>You know what?
I'm sorry.</i>

22:02.983 --> 22:03.916
<i>You're right.</i>

22:04.817 --> 22:06.353
<i>Look, you go
and enjoy your evening.</i>

22:06.386 --> 22:08.021
<i>I'll say no more on this.</i>

22:08.054 --> 22:10.423
<i>The ball's in your court
and we'll leave it at that.</i>

22:10.457 --> 22:11.890
<i>I can wait until you're ready.</i>

22:11.924 --> 22:14.327
<i>I ain't going anywhere, ok?</i>

22:14.361 --> 22:16.096
Thank you.

22:16.129 --> 22:17.964
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, ok?</i>

22:18.864 --> 22:20.300
See you tomorrow.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.834
Bye.

22:21.867 --> 22:23.203
<i>Bye.</i>

22:26.872 --> 22:28.441
Confused about what,
Lauren?

22:32.012 --> 22:33.413
Nothing.

22:35.215 --> 22:37.117
- It's your go.
- Guys!

22:37.150 --> 22:39.519
You're such a moron.

22:39.552 --> 22:40.520
Come and play, Eric!

22:40.553 --> 22:42.155
Yeah, Eric, come and play.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.922
Nah, food's almost ready.

22:43.957 --> 22:44.857
Ok, moron.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.526
Oi you, come here!

22:49.862 --> 22:50.597
Did you build your swing?

22:50.630 --> 22:51.665
No.

22:51.698 --> 22:53.566
I got the rope over
but the branch is too high.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.268
I need you to help me tie it.

22:55.935 --> 22:57.237
Eric, put him down.

22:57.270 --> 22:59.172
Maybe I'll help you
with it tomorrow.

22:59.205 --> 23:01.341
Always a pleasure
coming home for Christmas!

23:28.635 --> 23:30.103
Hey.

23:31.104 --> 23:32.472
How d'ya feel, Cassie?

23:32.505 --> 23:34.207
Yeah, fine.

23:36.042 --> 23:37.010
Great.

23:37.043 --> 23:39.979
Well, that's a meal and a movie
next week then

23:40.013 --> 23:41.581
if I can get a sitter?

23:41.614 --> 23:43.450
Yeah, well, take me
to the theatre

23:43.483 --> 23:45.385
- and I'm all yours!
- Done.

23:45.985 --> 23:48.321
I'll see if I can call
Nancy on Friday.

23:48.355 --> 23:50.156
When's dinner, Mum?
Ben's starving!

23:50.190 --> 23:51.591
Put him down, love.

23:51.624 --> 23:53.960
Blame dad, he did that
to me all the time.

23:53.993 --> 23:55.662
Difference is,
you used to cry.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.630
Yeah, well, that's why
we don't do it any more,

23:57.664 --> 23:58.631
right, Michael?

23:58.665 --> 24:00.899
I used to hold you up
by your feet, actually.

24:00.934 --> 24:02.235
Hence the crying.

24:03.169 --> 24:03.937
I'm sitting next to mum!

24:03.970 --> 24:06.239
Go on,
I'll deal with you later.

24:06.272 --> 24:09.042
Oh Michael,
I forgot to do the onions.

24:09.609 --> 24:13.113
Not the onions!
Oh, God, no!

24:14.214 --> 24:16.216
Chill out,
enjoy your drink.

24:16.249 --> 24:17.517
Jesus!

24:24.124 --> 24:26.960
Right on time, come in!

24:34.534 --> 24:36.002
We're through here, Luce.

24:54.621 --> 24:56.022
How's it going?

25:19.546 --> 25:22.315
Oh, Lucy,
how lovely to see you!

25:24.384 --> 25:25.985
How are you?

25:26.019 --> 25:27.454
How are you?

25:27.720 --> 25:28.755
I'm good.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.324
Yeah, I'm great, actually!

25:31.357 --> 25:33.726
Oh, Lucy, would you mind
helping me with this?

25:35.295 --> 25:38.031
I completely forgot to put them
in with the pheasants.

26:16.169 --> 26:17.670
You're gonna love this,
mate.

26:25.645 --> 26:27.247
Hey?

26:27.280 --> 26:30.149
Now, what you're looking at
is a broken-down old relic.

26:30.183 --> 26:33.319
But I look at this
and I see my old dad.

26:35.455 --> 26:37.724
Well, that's all I've got left
to remember him by.

26:37.757 --> 26:39.726
My inheritance.

26:41.828 --> 26:43.696
Do you know, every Friday
I'd come home from school,

26:43.730 --> 26:45.465
and me and my dad would sit
in front of this thing

26:45.498 --> 26:47.066
and we'd watch our
favorite shows

26:47.100 --> 26:48.635
right up to the early hours.

26:49.769 --> 26:52.105
Loved spending time together,
we did.

26:53.506 --> 26:54.274
Do you know I can't
even remember

26:54.307 --> 26:56.109
what half the shows
were about?

26:58.745 --> 27:01.781
It's just that we enjoyed
each other's company.

27:05.118 --> 27:07.654
They're the times
I remember the best.

27:11.658 --> 27:13.293
The old man lost
most of his money

27:13.326 --> 27:15.395
when the coal mines closed.

27:15.428 --> 27:17.630
They had to sell everything
to make ends meet,

27:17.664 --> 27:19.499
apart from this.

27:22.569 --> 27:24.804
I want to leave this
to my boy.

27:26.439 --> 27:29.142
I ain't gonna be around
forever, am I?

27:29.175 --> 27:32.245
I just hope that it means as
much to him as it does to me.

27:37.617 --> 27:39.352
You're right.
It's broken.

27:46.292 --> 27:48.428
But I'm gonna fix it.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.769
I want to fix it.

27:58.438 --> 28:00.306
There's no inheritance
for us.

28:03.876 --> 28:06.212
We'll take what we can get.

28:08.481 --> 28:09.716
Oh, Jack.

28:11.618 --> 28:13.486
I'm so sorry.

28:13.519 --> 28:16.356
Ignore me,
I'm not thinking straight.

28:16.389 --> 28:18.491
Hey. Lucy.

28:20.660 --> 28:23.630
Jack, I know you wanted
to see this earlier.

28:26.499 --> 28:28.568
Now there's a toy
with purpose.

28:32.739 --> 28:34.641
You like?

28:36.676 --> 28:38.678
She's a bloody beauty,
isn't she, son?

28:38.711 --> 28:40.513
Excuse my language, Lucy.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.548
Do you know what?

28:42.582 --> 28:45.718
If those new safety windows
don't keep intruders out,

28:45.752 --> 28:47.854
- this thing definitely will.
- <i>Michael?</i>

28:47.887 --> 28:50.356
Oh.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.624
Food.

29:09.009 --> 29:11.778
<i>Go on through, guys,
the kids are in the living room.</i>

29:26.726 --> 29:27.760
Are they ok?

29:27.794 --> 29:29.829
Yeah, I think so.

29:29.862 --> 29:31.631
It's just awkward,
isn't it?

29:33.366 --> 29:35.334
I mean,

29:35.368 --> 29:37.870
Christmas should be spent
with your family,

29:37.904 --> 29:38.939
shouldn't it?

29:38.972 --> 29:40.873
- Poor boy.
- I know.

29:40.907 --> 29:42.508
I don't think I could
have shaken it off

29:42.542 --> 29:43.743
if I'd have been
in his shoes.

29:43.776 --> 29:45.411
Yeah.

29:45.445 --> 29:48.414
Let's just try to make them
feel as welcome as possible.

29:48.448 --> 29:49.582
That's all we can do,
isn't it?

29:49.615 --> 29:50.917
Of course.

29:56.522 --> 29:57.824
I give it five years.

29:57.857 --> 29:59.392
Dad's got a full
head of hair.

29:59.425 --> 29:59.960
Almost.

29:59.993 --> 30:01.294
Lauren, don't scare him.

30:01.327 --> 30:02.595
Doesn't matter,
it skips a gen.

30:02.628 --> 30:03.964
Look, you're receding already.

30:03.997 --> 30:05.364
Get off!
Lauren!

30:05.398 --> 30:06.766
Anyway,
I'm not scared, old man.

30:06.799 --> 30:08.468
- Lauren's wrong, though.
- We'll see.

30:08.501 --> 30:09.802
Children.

30:09.836 --> 30:10.971
Will I go bald, Mum?

30:11.004 --> 30:12.672
Oh, kids, please!

30:14.540 --> 30:16.409
Lauren, how's Matt?

30:18.544 --> 30:19.779
Fine.

30:19.812 --> 30:20.747
What dad meant was,

30:20.780 --> 30:22.515
how are you doing
as an intimate couple?

30:22.548 --> 30:24.283
None of your business,
loner.

30:24.317 --> 30:26.385
Date nights,
intimacy, pregnancy.

30:26.419 --> 30:27.720
Eric, shut up!

30:28.989 --> 30:31.724
Eric, don't pea
on your sister!

30:31.758 --> 30:33.593
- My little baby girl?
- Mum!

30:33.626 --> 30:35.528
- You're not actually pregnant, are you?
- No!

30:35.561 --> 30:36.529
Could be.

30:36.562 --> 30:38.698
Eric, stop teasing
your sister.

30:42.002 --> 30:43.803
So why didn't he
want to come tonight?

30:44.938 --> 30:46.606
Why would he?

30:46.639 --> 30:47.874
He proposed, Mum!

30:47.907 --> 30:49.275
Did he really?

30:50.043 --> 30:52.012
- No?
- Such a dick.

30:53.981 --> 30:55.015
Right.

30:55.048 --> 30:56.382
I'm fine.

30:56.415 --> 30:57.517
Matt's fine.

30:57.550 --> 30:58.618
We're not pregnant,

30:58.651 --> 31:00.419
nor are we engaged.

31:00.453 --> 31:01.587
Aw, disappointing.

31:01.621 --> 31:04.091
Says the single, friendless,
twenty-nine year old mong.

31:04.124 --> 31:05.591
- Love you.
- Yuck.

31:05.625 --> 31:06.659
My kids!

31:10.730 --> 31:12.331
Dad, I'm sorry

31:12.365 --> 31:14.433
but he's with
his parents tonight.

31:14.467 --> 31:15.568
Well, that's a shame.

31:15.601 --> 31:17.336
Dad loves his guests.

31:18.704 --> 31:20.107
The more the merrier.

31:20.140 --> 31:22.575
But you two are happy,
yes, love?

31:23.743 --> 31:24.811
Yeah.

31:24.844 --> 31:26.379
Yeah.

31:26.412 --> 31:27.480
And if you must know

31:27.513 --> 31:29.916
we have been talking
about the idea of marriage.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.818
- Oh, Lauren!
- No, no, no, Mum.

31:31.851 --> 31:34.787
No, stop! Stop it!

31:34.821 --> 31:36.856
Another excuse
to use the shotgun.

31:36.889 --> 31:39.692
- Oh, Michael Henderson!
- Merry Christmas, sis.

31:39.725 --> 31:40.760
A bit harsh, Dad!

31:40.793 --> 31:42.595
Alright, we're only playing.

31:42.628 --> 31:45.364
Yeah, but why is it always
at my expense?

31:45.398 --> 31:47.100
I'm sorry.

31:47.134 --> 31:51.804
In all seriousness, Lauren,

31:53.073 --> 31:54.640
no, we're thrilled for you.
We really are.

31:54.674 --> 31:55.708
We're so proud,

31:55.741 --> 31:58.778
and I want you to know that
we love Matt. We do.

31:58.811 --> 32:00.680
We wanted both of you
to know that.

32:00.713 --> 32:01.547
Yeah, we love Matt.

32:01.581 --> 32:04.851
We've just talked about
the idea of it.

32:04.884 --> 32:06.752
We're not there yet, ok?

32:06.786 --> 32:09.722
You take as long as you need,
love, alright?

32:09.755 --> 32:12.059
We just want our little girl
to be happy.

32:12.092 --> 32:13.726
She's so happy.

32:13.759 --> 32:15.162
No, I'm with your mum
on this one.

32:15.195 --> 32:16.863
As long as you're happy.

32:18.165 --> 32:19.799
Thanks, Dad.

32:20.499 --> 32:23.569
And if the time comes,

32:23.603 --> 32:25.538
you know we're right
behind you.

32:25.571 --> 32:27.807
You'll have our backing,
financially, as well.

32:29.675 --> 32:32.678
Ok, thank you both.

32:32.712 --> 32:35.514
But can we stop talking about
my private life, please?

32:35.548 --> 32:36.682
Aw.

32:39.052 --> 32:40.553
Sorry.

32:41.088 --> 32:43.422
Lucy, how's the food?

32:47.727 --> 32:50.529
So, can I have your attention
for a moment, please?

32:50.563 --> 32:52.065
I've got an announcement
to make.

32:52.099 --> 32:53.066
You have?

32:53.100 --> 32:54.968
Can you even
still have babies?

32:55.002 --> 32:56.203
Babies on the mind?

32:56.236 --> 32:58.704
I assure you,
it all still works down there.

32:58.738 --> 33:00.439
Dad, that's gross.

33:00.473 --> 33:01.774
Divorce?

33:02.175 --> 33:04.978
I'll divorce you in a minute,
you little smart-ass.

33:05.012 --> 33:07.446
Just pipe down,
alright, guys?

33:08.547 --> 33:11.151
Stop!
Oh, you're disgusting.

33:13.153 --> 33:14.887
Sorry, Mum.
Go on.

33:18.258 --> 33:23.063
So you all know
that it's been seven months

33:23.096 --> 33:25.198
since I was diagnosed

33:25.232 --> 33:27.733
with a very low chance
of survival.

33:29.502 --> 33:30.870
Mum?

33:31.837 --> 33:34.740
Honey, can't we talk
about this tomorrow?

33:34.774 --> 33:36.742
Please.

33:36.776 --> 33:38.477
We haven't been together
in so long

33:38.511 --> 33:40.680
and I need to get this
off my chest.

33:43.749 --> 33:47.087
So, the doctors,
God bless them,

33:47.120 --> 33:48.821
they did say
right at the beginning

33:48.854 --> 33:52.692
that the success rates
for chemo were very low.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.097
They offered me
so much support,

33:57.130 --> 33:58.531
and they were very thorough

33:58.564 --> 33:59.967
with the information
they gave me.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.567
The options I had,

34:01.600 --> 34:05.205
and my life expectancy
with or without the chemo.

34:06.605 --> 34:09.542
It's no surprise
that I chose the chemo

34:09.575 --> 34:13.113
because they told me I'd last
about eight weeks without it,

34:13.146 --> 34:15.949
- and it's been...
- Seven months.

34:15.983 --> 34:17.817
You look amazing, Mum.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.053
Let your mother speak, son.

34:20.087 --> 34:21.754
Eric, it's ok.

34:25.258 --> 34:32.832
So, chemo is rarely the answer.
It just prolongs life,

34:35.135 --> 34:39.139
and sometimes that's not
necessarily the right answer.

34:41.640 --> 34:44.744
It just puts the disease
on hold.

34:47.047 --> 34:52.052
I love you all more than
anything in this world.

34:58.824 --> 35:02.661
So, you think the doctors
were good?

35:03.930 --> 35:08.801
Well, that's nothing compared
to the unconditional love

35:08.834 --> 35:11.071
that you've all given me.

35:12.372 --> 35:15.008
The painful sleepless nights,
Michael.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.612
The daily phone calls.

35:22.015 --> 35:25.952
The lovely visits
and so much more.

35:25.986 --> 35:28.921
I love you all to the moon
and back.

35:33.659 --> 35:36.163
So, last month I decided
that it would be smart

35:36.196 --> 35:40.000
to write a will,
and I did.

35:40.033 --> 35:42.735
But then a couple of days ago
the doctors advised me

35:42.768 --> 35:46.106
that it was now pointless.

35:46.139 --> 35:47.740
Honey, come on,

35:47.773 --> 35:49.708
what kind of doctor
would tell you that?

35:49.742 --> 35:50.810
Who was he?

35:50.843 --> 35:52.079
They all sat me down

35:52.112 --> 35:54.680
and they said that their
decision was unanimous.

35:54.713 --> 35:55.848
Why?

35:57.384 --> 36:00.619
Because I'm officially
in remission.

36:02.389 --> 36:03.990
What?

36:04.723 --> 36:06.859
Mum? Serious?

36:06.892 --> 36:08.594
Serious!

36:08.995 --> 36:10.663
It's gone?

36:11.264 --> 36:13.400
Well, I mean, there's a slim
chance of it coming back,

36:13.433 --> 36:17.636
of course, but in all
practical senses, yes!

36:17.670 --> 36:19.039
Mum, that's amazing.

36:24.743 --> 36:27.013
- I love you, Mum.
- I love you.

36:28.814 --> 36:29.950
You alright, Dad?

36:29.983 --> 36:32.152
Of course I am,
you daft sod.

36:34.321 --> 36:36.022
Why didn't you tell us
when you found out?

36:36.056 --> 36:39.159
Because she wanted to
torture you, crybaby.

36:39.192 --> 36:41.161
- You're horrible.
- You deserved that one.

36:42.362 --> 36:43.896
What's remission?

36:46.832 --> 36:50.437
Hey, it means that your
mother's not ill anymore.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.638
- You happy, bro?
- Yes!

36:57.877 --> 36:59.412
Perfect timing, Cass.

36:59.446 --> 37:02.149
I thought it would be a good
Christmas present.

37:03.416 --> 37:05.018
Dad, shall we go back
to talking about

37:05.051 --> 37:06.119
Lauren's love life again?

37:06.153 --> 37:08.221
- You dare.
- I love you all.

37:08.255 --> 37:09.389
Alright, hold on a minute.

37:09.422 --> 37:11.391
Pipe down, you lot,
just for a moment.

37:11.424 --> 37:14.094
I think this calls
for a toast.

37:14.127 --> 37:15.962
- Go on, Dad.
- Hear, hear!

37:15.996 --> 37:20.766
To the most beautiful,
amazing, incredible wife.

37:20.799 --> 37:21.867
And mum.

37:21.901 --> 37:23.069
Yep,

37:23.103 --> 37:27.207
and to the most incredible mum
to our beautiful children.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.742
I give you Cassie Henderson!

37:29.775 --> 37:31.044
To Mum!

37:41.454 --> 37:43.190
Oh, my God, Lucy!

37:44.457 --> 37:46.326
Stop it! Stop it!

37:52.798 --> 37:54.301
No!

38:07.214 --> 38:08.949
Sit down!

38:20.193 --> 38:21.894
Very well.

38:46.953 --> 38:48.154
Eat.

40:02.128 --> 40:05.332
We're all just products
of our own environments.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.338
Betrayals, neglect.

40:14.307 --> 40:16.209
The things we've done,

40:17.610 --> 40:21.081
the things done to us.

40:24.617 --> 40:26.586
The burden of our elders'

40:26.619 --> 40:29.922
insecurities forcefully
dressing us

40:29.956 --> 40:32.625
in life long misery jackets,

40:36.096 --> 40:38.498
paying the price for
other people's mistakes.

40:41.668 --> 40:45.939
But when you think about it,
Lauren,

40:45.972 --> 40:48.608
you are merely just a sponge

40:48.641 --> 40:52.612
soaking up all
the self centered action

40:52.645 --> 40:58.184
of those who supposedly
love you so selflessly.

41:01.988 --> 41:03.957
Don't you want
to be set free?

41:47.367 --> 41:48.701
Move!

42:39.486 --> 42:42.288
I don't care
what you do to me,

42:42.322 --> 42:45.091
but please just leave
my kids alone.

43:24.464 --> 43:26.099
Come clean, Michael.

43:31.804 --> 43:33.106
Get some rest.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.275
Dad!

43:35.642 --> 43:37.410
Lucy, stop!
Don't hurt him!

43:37.443 --> 43:39.112
Nobody's getting hurt, hmm?

43:40.847 --> 43:42.515
It's getting late.

43:42.549 --> 43:44.517
People are tired.
I'm tired.

43:46.653 --> 43:48.688
Let's all just calm down,
shall we?

43:49.789 --> 43:52.191
There's no need to get
worked up over nothing.

43:55.695 --> 43:57.196
What?

43:57.330 --> 43:58.398
What?

43:59.732 --> 44:02.569
Please stop this.

44:04.304 --> 44:05.572
I'll do anything.

44:06.606 --> 44:11.277
Just let us go,
I'm begging you.

44:11.311 --> 44:13.479
We never done
anything to you.

44:14.781 --> 44:17.717
Lucy, please, no!

44:17.750 --> 44:19.152
<i>Please!</i>

44:24.157 --> 44:25.558
<i>No!</i>

44:55.722 --> 44:57.457
Why'd you do that
to my mum?!

45:02.595 --> 45:04.864
She was already dead.

45:14.741 --> 45:16.142
Lie down.

45:33.326 --> 45:35.461
Oh, please, God.

45:36.964 --> 45:38.431
Please.

45:40.533 --> 45:41.868
Please, Jack.

46:29.649 --> 46:31.484
<i>Years ago,</i>

46:31.517 --> 46:36.289
<i>a father and his family
lived happily in a big,</i>

46:36.322 --> 46:38.257
bright house,

46:40.660 --> 46:43.696
and one day
the father decided

46:43.730 --> 46:46.632
to invite some guests
inside.

46:48.068 --> 46:50.803
The guests willingly obliged.

46:52.072 --> 46:54.574
The father took them
under his wing,

46:54.607 --> 46:57.577
but this was short lived,
though.

47:01.681 --> 47:03.416
Little did the guests know

47:03.449 --> 47:07.754
that eventually the father
would deem them unwanted,

47:10.090 --> 47:13.359
and so when the time came,

47:17.363 --> 47:23.436
the father took for himself
what was rightfully theirs,

47:23.469 --> 47:26.839
and unfairly banished them,

47:30.010 --> 47:33.312
leaving them to rot.

47:38.918 --> 47:42.022
So the guests waited

47:42.055 --> 47:48.494
and waited
and waited and waited,

47:48.528 --> 47:50.563
until one night

47:53.766 --> 47:57.303
they found their way
back into the garden.

47:58.538 --> 48:02.542
But they had disguised
themselves.

48:05.045 --> 48:06.712
Do you see?

48:08.015 --> 48:09.950
Do you see?!

48:12.485 --> 48:17.857
The father,
not knowing he had been tricked,

48:17.890 --> 48:21.894
welcomed them back
into his home,

48:21.929 --> 48:29.002
right under his
pretentious little nose.

48:36.009 --> 48:40.446
Do you know how
this story ends, Ben?

48:46.019 --> 48:51.992
They destroy
everything he loves.

48:54.161 --> 48:55.761
Who are you?

48:59.099 --> 49:02.069
Demons come
as angels of light.

49:11.577 --> 49:12.778
Don't do that.

51:07.560 --> 51:08.996
- Come on.
- <i>Hello?</i>

51:10.629 --> 51:11.864
Matt.

51:14.167 --> 51:18.305
I need you to get help
and come here.

51:18.338 --> 51:20.573
There's people in the house.

51:21.574 --> 51:23.776
<i>Lauren, you're scaring me.</i>

51:26.346 --> 51:29.950
My parents' friends came over
for dinner tonight.

51:29.983 --> 51:31.751
<i>Yeah?</i>

51:31.784 --> 51:35.588
We were having dinner
and...

51:37.790 --> 51:39.859
they killed mum.

51:40.994 --> 51:42.195
<i>What?</i>

51:42.929 --> 51:44.998
They killed her.

51:45.032 --> 51:48.168
She murdered her
right in front of us.

51:49.069 --> 51:50.170
<i>Lauren,
what the hell is this?</i>

51:50.203 --> 51:52.139
<i>You're not making any sense.</i>

51:52.172 --> 51:53.373
They didn't stop hitting.

51:53.407 --> 51:59.179
She had a hammer and she just
kept thumping mum's head...

52:03.616 --> 52:04.817
<i>Lauren?</i>

52:04.850 --> 52:07.320
...until there was
nothing left.

52:13.659 --> 52:16.595
My mum is dead.

52:16.629 --> 52:17.931
<i>Lauren, who did this?</i>

52:17.964 --> 52:19.899
My mum is dead.

52:19.933 --> 52:21.334
<i>Lauren!</i>

52:23.303 --> 52:25.305
The neighbors.

52:25.338 --> 52:27.673
<i>The neighbors?
What neighbors?</i>

52:29.875 --> 52:32.179
Jack and Lucy.

52:32.212 --> 52:33.980
<i>Jack and Lucy?</i>

52:34.314 --> 52:35.581
<i>Why?</i>

52:36.950 --> 52:38.651
I don't know.

52:39.319 --> 52:41.955
Mum never did
anything wrong.

52:44.057 --> 52:46.393
Why would they do this?

52:46.426 --> 52:49.196
<i>Lauren,
just get out of the house.</i>

52:49.229 --> 52:50.863
I can't.

52:50.896 --> 52:53.366
<i>Babe, whereabouts
are you right now?</i>

52:53.400 --> 52:56.769
In my room,
on my bed.

52:59.872 --> 53:02.109
<i>Just get out now.</i>

53:02.142 --> 53:03.642
I can't.

53:03.676 --> 53:05.744
<i>What do you mean you can't?
Just run!</i>

53:05.778 --> 53:08.747
They're still in the house,
they've got Ben.

53:08.781 --> 53:10.749
<i>Babe, call the police.</i>

53:10.783 --> 53:12.852
I can't.
They've got Ben now,

53:12.885 --> 53:14.254
I need to go get him.

53:14.287 --> 53:16.289
<i>No. You, you need
to call the police.</i>

53:16.323 --> 53:18.225
I need to go and get Ben.

53:18.258 --> 53:19.825
<i>Lauren,
don't make a sound.</i>

53:19.859 --> 53:20.759
<i>Just hide.</i>

53:20.793 --> 53:22.661
<i>Stay as quiet as possible.</i>

53:23.863 --> 53:27.367
Matt, I need you to come
in here and help me.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.369
<i>No, no, no, no.
Listen to me,</i>

53:29.402 --> 53:31.171
<i>you need to stay still.</i>

53:31.204 --> 53:32.372
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

53:32.405 --> 53:34.673
<i>Just stay quiet.</i>

53:35.908 --> 53:39.246
<i>We've been watching you
for a long time.</i>

53:39.279 --> 53:41.047
Matt?

53:41.081 --> 53:44.650
<i>But I think you should
go to sleep now...</i>

54:24.057 --> 54:25.392
Lauren.

54:28.228 --> 54:29.728
<i>Lauren.</i>

54:30.964 --> 54:32.165
Eric?

54:58.391 --> 54:59.960
Lauren.

55:06.199 --> 55:07.800
Eric?

55:50.543 --> 55:52.145
Oh shit...

56:30.883 --> 56:32.152
Well, well, well.

56:33.553 --> 56:35.088
When I'm finished here,

56:38.224 --> 56:40.160
you're going to have to make
a choice, Lauren.

56:44.998 --> 56:47.567
They say that when you die,

56:49.202 --> 56:51.271
the ones that are affected

56:51.304 --> 56:53.440
are the ones
that you leave behind.

56:55.442 --> 56:58.244
So it all boils down to

56:58.278 --> 57:03.583
whether you want to put him
out of his misery.

57:05.452 --> 57:07.520
He won't know any better.

57:09.122 --> 57:10.523
Or don't.

57:11.558 --> 57:14.860
Save yourself
the lifelong guilt.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.936
But one thing I will say,

57:24.371 --> 57:26.339
if you don't,

57:26.373 --> 57:31.945
the consequences for him
will be far more severe.

57:37.117 --> 57:39.018
But why?

57:39.719 --> 57:42.389
I just want to get
to know you.

57:46.493 --> 57:48.395
I just want
to get to know you.

57:54.667 --> 57:59.272
You've so graciously
invited us over

58:02.409 --> 58:05.979
and you've been such
wonderful hosts.

58:25.698 --> 58:27.267
I think we're all set.

58:35.575 --> 58:36.509
Please.

58:37.143 --> 58:38.311
Please.

58:39.279 --> 58:41.080
Please, I'm sorry.

58:41.681 --> 58:44.217
Eric. Eric!

58:47.187 --> 58:49.088
He's waking up.

58:49.756 --> 58:51.991
Lucy, please.
Please.

58:53.159 --> 58:54.794
He's my brother.

58:58.665 --> 59:01.034
You'd better do it quickly.

59:01.434 --> 59:04.637
Please.
Please, Lucy.

59:07.507 --> 59:09.275
Do it.

59:29.596 --> 59:31.598
Lauren?
What are you doing?

59:32.799 --> 59:34.434
I'm so sorry.

59:34.467 --> 59:36.436
Lauren, no.

59:36.469 --> 59:38.171
They're gonna kill us.

59:39.205 --> 59:40.673
You're my sister.

59:41.508 --> 59:46.246
If I don't do this,
we'll both regret it.

59:49.849 --> 59:53.286
They're gonna do worse
things to you,

59:53.319 --> 59:56.422
and once they're done,
they'll do the same to me.

59:56.456 --> 59:58.191
I don't care.

59:59.826 --> 1:00:01.628
Please don't do this.

1:00:03.596 --> 1:00:05.598
I can't have
my sister kill me.

1:00:06.733 --> 1:00:09.068
I won't have
my sister kill me.

1:00:09.102 --> 1:00:10.703
You will.

1:00:10.737 --> 1:00:12.639
You will care.

1:00:15.341 --> 1:00:16.809
Just put it down.

1:00:16.843 --> 1:00:18.511
I can't.

1:00:19.779 --> 1:00:22.749
Look what they did to mum.

1:00:22.782 --> 1:00:26.085
I can't watch them do
something worse to you.

1:00:26.119 --> 1:00:30.290
Mum's dead.
I'm not.

1:00:30.323 --> 1:00:32.559
I'm sorry.

1:00:32.592 --> 1:00:36.162
They won't let me go,
they won't let us go!

1:00:39.465 --> 1:00:41.467
It's just you and me.

1:00:41.501 --> 1:00:43.136
There's nobody here.

1:00:43.903 --> 1:00:45.838
You've got a choice.

1:00:45.872 --> 1:00:48.308
You don't understand.

1:00:49.609 --> 1:00:51.411
They're watching us.

1:00:52.645 --> 1:00:55.582
They've been watching us
this whole time.

1:00:56.783 --> 1:00:59.419
If I don't do this,

1:00:59.452 --> 1:01:02.288
God knows
what they're gonna do next.

1:01:02.322 --> 1:01:04.123
They've gotten into
your head.

1:01:06.893 --> 1:01:08.795
Please don't do this.

1:01:10.663 --> 1:01:13.433
I always looked up to you
when we were kids.

1:01:14.667 --> 1:01:16.736
- Don't.
- I still do.

1:01:18.438 --> 1:01:20.406
You have a funny way
of showing it.

1:01:22.475 --> 1:01:25.144
Listen, you need help.

1:01:26.947 --> 1:01:29.916
Please put down the gun,
Lauren.

1:01:29.950 --> 1:01:31.451
I'd always run
into your room

1:01:31.484 --> 1:01:34.253
when mum and dad
used to fight,

1:01:34.287 --> 1:01:37.857
and every time,
you'd cheer me up.

1:01:38.491 --> 1:01:39.927
Stop.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:41.861
You still cheer me up.

1:01:44.397 --> 1:01:45.698
I love you.

1:01:45.732 --> 1:01:47.800
Do you?

1:01:47.834 --> 1:01:49.402
You're about to kill me.

1:01:49.435 --> 1:01:51.304
You don't understand.

1:01:51.337 --> 1:01:54.574
No, you don't understand
what I'm trying to say.

1:01:59.545 --> 1:02:01.581
Please don't kill me.

1:02:02.983 --> 1:02:04.751
I have no choice.

1:02:04.784 --> 1:02:06.753
We always have a choice.

1:02:09.622 --> 1:02:11.524
This is for the best.

1:02:13.593 --> 1:02:17.363
No, no.
Lauren please, no.

1:02:17.397 --> 1:02:18.698
Lauren.

1:02:18.731 --> 1:02:20.466
- I'm sorry.
- Lauren!

1:02:43.823 --> 1:02:45.926
They gave me no choice.

1:02:47.727 --> 1:02:49.529
You had a choice.

1:02:49.562 --> 1:02:51.631
I'm so sorry.

1:02:53.666 --> 1:02:55.468
Fuck you!

1:02:57.804 --> 1:03:00.440
I've been there for you
your entire life!

1:03:01.474 --> 1:03:03.242
You and Ben.

1:03:04.510 --> 1:03:07.714
For all your
self-indulgent bullshit,

1:03:10.450 --> 1:03:13.319
even when you were wrong,

1:03:13.352 --> 1:03:15.755
I was always there!

1:03:15.788 --> 1:03:17.991
I'm so sorry.

1:03:18.025 --> 1:03:20.460
I can't.

1:03:22.795 --> 1:03:24.664
I'll never forgive you.

1:03:28.936 --> 1:03:31.370
I had no choice.
I had no choice.

1:03:32.505 --> 1:03:33.806
I forgive you.

1:03:34.807 --> 1:03:35.708
Stop!

1:03:35.742 --> 1:03:38.611
What have I done?
I didn't do anything!

1:03:38.644 --> 1:03:41.581
Leave him alone!
I'm so sorry, Eric.

1:03:41.614 --> 1:03:44.383
I'm so sorry, Eric.

1:03:45.953 --> 1:03:47.854
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...

1:03:54.527 --> 1:03:57.430
Leave my kids alone,
you fucking animals!

1:03:57.931 --> 1:03:59.699
<i>Leave them alone!
Please!</i>

1:03:59.732 --> 1:04:00.633
Dad!

1:04:00.666 --> 1:04:03.636
<i>Open this door.
Open this fucking door!</i>

1:04:03.669 --> 1:04:06.739
<i>Please, please, open this.</i>

1:04:09.342 --> 1:04:10.576
<i>Dad.</i>

1:04:11.878 --> 1:04:13.346
Dad.

1:04:17.517 --> 1:04:19.619
This is all my fault, son.

1:04:20.853 --> 1:04:22.822
Jack is my son,

1:04:26.692 --> 1:04:28.561
and I never told him,

1:04:30.530 --> 1:04:33.833
and I bought this
on all of us.

1:04:34.801 --> 1:04:37.070
What do you mean,
he's your son?

1:04:37.104 --> 1:04:39.739
It was a long time ago,

1:04:41.041 --> 1:04:43.010
before I met your mother.

1:04:45.444 --> 1:04:47.413
I was a coward.

1:04:48.048 --> 1:04:51.551
I panicked and I left them.

1:04:55.721 --> 1:04:57.657
I left them.

1:04:59.458 --> 1:05:01.460
And then I met your mother.

1:05:07.533 --> 1:05:10.603
She made me a stronger man.

1:05:12.672 --> 1:05:16.043
And I tried to go back,
I tried to fix it.

1:05:19.012 --> 1:05:24.717
But I didn't know
how to tell him

1:05:26.485 --> 1:05:27.787
or you

1:05:28.821 --> 1:05:31.024
and I'm sorry.

1:05:32.125 --> 1:05:34.094
I'm sorry.

1:05:42.668 --> 1:05:43.903
Lauren!

1:05:45.471 --> 1:05:46.974
<i>Eric!</i>

1:05:49.775 --> 1:05:51.044
Lauren!

1:05:51.577 --> 1:05:52.778
Eric!

1:05:53.180 --> 1:05:54.714
Eric!

1:05:54.747 --> 1:05:58.885
No! No! No!

1:05:58.918 --> 1:06:00.553
- <i>Lauren!</i>
- No!

1:06:06.093 --> 1:06:07.426
Open this door!

1:06:07.460 --> 1:06:09.062
Open this fucking door!

1:06:10.931 --> 1:06:12.665
<i>Open this door!</i>

1:06:35.956 --> 1:06:37.523
Leave him alone!

1:06:43.163 --> 1:06:45.564
Eric, I'm so sorry.

1:06:58.577 --> 1:06:59.745
<i>Eric?</i>

1:09:30.263 --> 1:09:31.630
Lauren?

1:10:37.130 --> 1:10:38.431
Son?

1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:41.767
What did they do to you?

1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:43.869
They took my eyes.

1:10:47.374 --> 1:10:48.807
They what?

1:10:50.776 --> 1:10:52.445
Jesus Christ!

1:11:04.124 --> 1:11:05.824
We've got
to get out of here!

1:11:05.858 --> 1:11:07.327
We've got to get out!

1:11:08.061 --> 1:11:09.963
Where's your brother?

1:11:09.996 --> 1:11:11.730
Where's your sister?

1:11:11.764 --> 1:11:13.133
The garage.

1:11:16.802 --> 1:11:18.205
Ok. Come on.

1:11:19.039 --> 1:11:20.340
Be quiet.

1:12:02.515 --> 1:12:04.985
I've got to get you
to a hospital.

1:12:07.053 --> 1:12:09.089
I'm not gonna let anything
else happen to you.

1:12:09.122 --> 1:12:11.258
No, you won't.

1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:15.262
Are you alright?

1:12:18.265 --> 1:12:19.966
Yes, Michael.

1:12:22.835 --> 1:12:25.105
We're exactly
where we need to be.

1:13:09.316 --> 1:13:10.883
Dad?

1:13:59.566 --> 1:14:01.067
You're not my son.

1:14:01.468 --> 1:14:03.169
You're not my...

1:14:04.037 --> 1:14:05.972
You're not my son.

1:14:06.005 --> 1:14:08.241
Get off!

1:14:08.274 --> 1:14:09.908
You're not my son.

1:14:11.211 --> 1:14:13.113
You're not my son.

1:14:13.146 --> 1:14:14.347
Dad.

1:14:17.350 --> 1:14:18.518
Dad.

1:14:18.551 --> 1:14:20.186
Dad, don't!

1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:21.121
Dad!

1:14:21.154 --> 1:14:23.022
You're not my son!

1:14:31.698 --> 1:14:33.366
I'm sorry.

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:36.236
I'm sorry.

1:14:39.305 --> 1:14:40.974
I'm sorry.

1:14:41.975 --> 1:14:44.377
I'm so sorry.

1:14:54.287 --> 1:14:56.623
I'm so sorry.

1:16:52.539 --> 1:16:54.140
Stop!

1:17:30.276 --> 1:17:32.245
No, Lauren!

1:17:36.716 --> 1:17:38.117
Lauren!

1:17:38.251 --> 1:17:39.352
No, no.

1:17:40.753 --> 1:17:42.589
Lauren, no!

1:18:46.352 --> 1:18:47.387
Ben?

1:18:52.825 --> 1:18:54.193
Ben?

1:18:57.430 --> 1:18:58.564
Ben?

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:01.701
Ben?

1:19:08.574 --> 1:19:09.709
Ben!

1:20:39.066 --> 1:20:40.767
Go to Hell!

1:20:46.439 --> 1:20:48.474
I'm sorry, son.

1:20:49.977 --> 1:20:51.677
I'm sorry.

1:21:17.603 --> 1:21:18.972
Lauren!

1:21:20.406 --> 1:21:21.674
Ben?

1:21:34.121 --> 1:21:36.123
I'm going to take care
of you from now on.

1:21:36.156 --> 1:21:37.723
I promise...

1:21:40.027 --> 1:21:41.861
