WEBVTT

00:07.700 --> 00:10.300
- *

00:10.400 --> 00:12.700
- Ready...

00:12.800 --> 00:15.233
Set...

00:15.333 --> 00:17.067
Stretch!

00:20.133 --> 00:23.233
- Aw, are you guys playing
Tug 'o Link again?

00:23.333 --> 00:25.967
- The winner gets to sit
next to Link at the movies.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.867
- The loser has to sit
next to you, Phoebe.

00:28.967 --> 00:30.767
Sorry, you're a popcorn hog.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.733
- BILLY: Ow!
- NORA: I win!

00:37.333 --> 00:39.700
How about we play
"Hurry Up"?

00:44.733 --> 00:46.800
I love how much fun you
have with my siblings.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.667
I've got "party"
written all over me.

00:50.767 --> 00:53.667
- Uh, you actually do.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.767
- Well, that's a reminder to
pick up the birthday cake--

00:55.867 --> 00:58.233
you know, for Harris'
birthday party on Saturday.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.733
- I feel so bad--I hardly
even know your brother

01:00.833 --> 01:02.733
and my brother loves you.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.167
- My other brother.

01:08.267 --> 01:10.067
- But, since I have
your attention,

01:10.133 --> 01:11.333
fill your eyeballs
with the centerpiece

01:11.433 --> 01:13.167
of my new villain uniform.

01:13.267 --> 01:15.767
Behold, the Cloak of--whoa!

01:17.833 --> 01:20.433
- The Cloak of Whoa.
I like it.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.667
- Don't you have
your own home?

01:25.367 --> 01:28.300
- Dark Mayhem wants to see
your evil villain uniform,

01:28.400 --> 01:31.533
not your Friar Tuck costume.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.733
- Let me guess.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.967
You wanna help me design
my new villain uniform?

01:35.067 --> 01:37.300
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.700
How do you feel
about rhinestones?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.600
- What should I get your
brother for his birthday?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.300
I don't even know
what the little guy's into.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.267
- Well, he is pretty quiet.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.800
So, he's into silent movies,
silent auctions,

01:49.900 --> 01:52.367
well, being silent.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.900
Oh, and one normal
thing--pirates,

01:54.067 --> 01:57.100
which is why his party is at
a pirate-themed laser tag place.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.233
- Oh, you mean las-arrrr-tag.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.733
I may or may not
have a punch card.

02:02.833 --> 02:07.067
- Oh, look what I got
for the kids to wear.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.667
Right?
- Whoa.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.367
That patch makes you
look just like your dad

02:10.467 --> 02:12.200
when he was still Evil Man.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.433
I'm taking this off.

02:15.533 --> 02:18.133
- Oh, wait, here's an idea.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.167
Why don't I hang out
with Harris on Saturday

02:20.267 --> 02:22.100
while you guys are setting
up the surprise party?

02:22.200 --> 02:23.700
It'll be the perfect
chance for us to bond.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.500
That'd be
a big help, actually.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.533
- I said, hurry up.
I'll miss the previews.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.700
- Evil Man's eyepatch

02:34.800 --> 02:36.900
would be perfect for
your villain uniform.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.267
It tapped into his brain

02:38.367 --> 02:41.733
and amplified
his evil instincts.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.133
- I know.

02:43.233 --> 02:46.600
Without an eyepatch,
Evil Man was just Cranky Man.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.100
Too bad he destroyed it.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.300
- You could build your own,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.867
if you could find its power
source--evilinium.

02:51.967 --> 02:55.900
But that stuff's harder to find
than a talking lady bunny.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.867
- If it's out there,
we'll find it.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.833
- No, the evilinium.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.233
You'll never find love.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.667
Lady bunny...

03:05.767 --> 03:07.967
- *

03:08.067 --> 03:09.167
* What you see

03:09.267 --> 03:10.667
* Is not what you get

03:10.767 --> 03:13.967
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

03:14.067 --> 03:15.767
* We fit right in

03:15.867 --> 03:17.200
* Bet you never guessed

03:17.300 --> 03:18.533
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

03:18.633 --> 03:20.300
* Just like all the rest

03:20.400 --> 03:22.100
* A picture
perfect family *

03:22.200 --> 03:24.200
* Is what we try to be

03:24.300 --> 03:25.367
* Look closer,
you might see *

03:25.467 --> 03:27.167
* The crazy things we do

03:27.267 --> 03:28.867
* This isn't
make believe *

03:28.967 --> 03:30.433
* It's our reality

03:30.533 --> 03:31.867
* Just your average family

03:31.967 --> 03:35.167
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:35.267 --> 03:38.800
* Livin' a double life *

03:43.500 --> 03:45.767
- Hey, Phoebs, thanks again
for watching Harris

03:45.867 --> 03:47.733
while I set up for
his party and, listen,

03:47.833 --> 03:50.133
don't be bummed if you don't
get him out of his shell.

03:50.233 --> 03:52.100
- Please, I'm great
with shells.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.167
I once got a turtle
outta his.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.367
It bit me right after,
but still...

03:56.467 --> 03:58.333
- Remember, the party's
tonight at 6:00.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.433
And, shhh, it's a surprise.
- Okay.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.600
- Come on, Harris.
Don't be shy.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.067
- Hey, there, Harris.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.600
- Link, why is your girlfriend
trying to punch me?

04:12.700 --> 04:15.333
She's not trying to punch you.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.400
You're not trying
to punch him, are you?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.467
No, it's a...
it's a fist bump.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.100
Okay, don't worry.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.200
This is how things started
with the turtle, too.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.933
- You tried to
fist bump a turtle?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.867
No wonder it bit you.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.733
Don't worry, okay?
I've got this.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.600
- Well, sure you do,
but just in case,

04:30.700 --> 04:33.300
here's a list of
safe hand gestures.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.333
Bye, buddy.
- No way, babe. Why would--

04:35.433 --> 04:37.533
- HANK: Hi!

04:37.633 --> 04:40.067
- Dad, get out! Get out!

04:41.667 --> 04:45.900
It's okay, Harris.
The loud man's gone.

04:46.067 --> 04:46.967
So, um...

04:47.067 --> 04:49.700
Oh, Link tells me you
have fire powers.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.533
I do, too.
Check it out.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.500
Your turn.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.433
- No, really, go.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.900
- That's it.
That's my power.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.500
Fire pinky.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.200
- That is super impressive!

05:06.300 --> 05:11.600
- My mom calls me her
"Widdle Night Wight."

05:11.700 --> 05:13.800
- Uh, anyway...

05:13.900 --> 05:17.367
Oh, I hear you like pirates
and every pirate needs a parrot.

05:17.467 --> 05:21.300
So I pulled some strings
and got us...

05:21.400 --> 05:24.533
a raven!

05:24.633 --> 05:27.300
They were out of parrots.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.067
- Aren't ravens
kinda dangerous?

05:31.267 --> 05:33.767
Harris, I am the Protector
of Hiddenville.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.333
I am pretty sure I can
handle some silly bird.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.633
- PHOEBE: Oh! Oh!

05:39.733 --> 05:43.133
And we're hugging already.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.900
Yay.

05:51.167 --> 05:54.667
- How's my replica of
Evil Man's eyepatch comin'?

05:54.767 --> 05:59.067
- Great! Just need to add
a few more rhinestones.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.667
Don't we sparkle, Max?

06:01.767 --> 06:03.867
- In the worst way.

06:03.967 --> 06:06.067
I need these things
off my patch.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.833
Now I located the last
of the evilinium.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.667
But it's heavily guarded
by native tribes.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.133
- So, you just need
to find someone

06:13.233 --> 06:14.967
dumb enough to go get it.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.800
Got it!

06:17.900 --> 06:19.633
Easy. Just like you said.

06:19.733 --> 06:22.133
I didn't even need
the shield you gave me.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.900
- All right, the evilinium
needs a few hours

06:30.067 --> 06:32.967
to charge the patch,
but once it's fully powered,

06:33.067 --> 06:34.567
it'll squash all
the good instincts

06:34.667 --> 06:37.600
Mom and Dad keep sayin'
are in here somewhere.

06:41.733 --> 06:43.433
And now we wait. Simple.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.867
- Well, since we have time,

06:44.967 --> 06:47.433
let's go shopping
for your villain uniform.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.300
But, first,
watch me sparkle!

06:55.067 --> 06:56.767
- COLOSSO: Yeah!

06:59.500 --> 07:00.967
- Hey, sweetie.

07:01.067 --> 07:05.200
Why are the sandwiches Mom
packed for your picnic on fire?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.367
- The picnic got boring--

07:06.467 --> 07:09.167
which gave me time to
work on my trick shot.

07:09.267 --> 07:10.533
Check this one out.

07:10.633 --> 07:12.600
Off the window,
off the garbage can,

07:12.700 --> 07:16.133
melting the juice box.

07:18.733 --> 07:22.967
- Nora Thunderman,
while impressive,

07:23.067 --> 07:25.700
shooting lasers across
the yard is very dangerous.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.200
- That's what I said!

07:31.100 --> 07:34.233
- You have to be more careful
using your powers, Nora.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.933
Your trick shots have cost
me a stack of sandwiches,

07:37.067 --> 07:40.333
the flat screen TV,
and my lucky sweatpants.

07:40.433 --> 07:41.667
- Yes, it was
definitely Nora

07:41.767 --> 07:43.900
who destroyed your
lucky sweat pants.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.067
Now, go, clean up this mess.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.633
- Fine. I will.

07:48.733 --> 07:50.867
After I pull off the mother
of all trick shots.

07:50.967 --> 07:52.867
You're gonna wanna
come outta

07:52.967 --> 07:55.067
your garbage 'hood
for this, Billy.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.600
Off Wong's house,
off that bird feeder,

08:00.700 --> 08:02.067
off the power lines,

08:02.100 --> 08:04.333
nothin' but watermelon.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.667
- CHLOE: Hi, guys.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.067
- I almost lasered Chloe.

08:14.133 --> 08:18.200
- You need a time out, lady.

08:23.500 --> 08:27.067
- The whole, uh, bird thing
was quite an adventure, huh?

08:27.133 --> 08:31.833
Bet you're gonna be
"raven" about it later.

08:31.933 --> 08:34.633
Get it?
- Yeah, I get it.

08:34.733 --> 08:36.367
Can I go home?

08:36.467 --> 08:38.067
Home?

08:38.100 --> 08:39.967
We're having so much fun.

08:40.067 --> 08:41.500
- PHOEBE: Bird!

08:45.500 --> 08:47.567
- Oh, don't go down there.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.400
That's Max's--
- Whoa!

08:49.500 --> 08:51.067
It's just like
a secret bunker

08:51.100 --> 08:52.800
from one of my pirate books.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.867
- Uh, well, yeah,
I was gonna say...

08:55.967 --> 08:57.800
don't go down there
'cause that's Max's

08:57.900 --> 09:00.667
sister's secret bunker.

09:00.767 --> 09:03.533
But guess what?
I'm Max's sister.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.300
Let's check it out.

09:10.433 --> 09:14.633
- Whoa! It's like
a giant treasure chest.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.200
Is this all yours?

09:16.300 --> 09:20.067
- Yep, it's definitely
all mine--Phoebe's.

09:22.500 --> 09:27.567
- All right, let's set sail
for Harris' P-arrrr-ty!

09:27.667 --> 09:28.867
You know,
my pirate impression

09:28.967 --> 09:32.067
really deserves
a gold st-arrrr!

09:32.100 --> 09:35.067
- Kids, hurry up, so your father
can stop talking like this.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.933
- Billy, that's not
what a pirate looks like.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.067
- I'm protecting
myself from Laser Girl.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.500
I don't wanna get
blown up like a melon.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.500
- I've said too much.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.433
- I have an announcement
to make.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.867
Henry, Barbara, William,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.733
whatever name "Chloe"
is short for.

10:04.433 --> 10:07.300
Yeah, I'm right.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.900
- I've thought about it

10:09.000 --> 10:10.867
and I was being
careless with my powers.

10:10.967 --> 10:13.600
So, I've decided to
never use them again.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.400
Carry on.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.133
- Whew, it looks like I won't
be needing this anymore.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.167
But I will need pants.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.267
- Something dangerous!
Put it down!

10:36.133 --> 10:38.800
Oh, hey, look what I found--

10:38.900 --> 10:40.867
in my own room.

10:40.967 --> 10:42.767
- I love eyepatches.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.700
- And I love
that we're bonding.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.933
- COLOSSO:
You are gonna look great

10:47.033 --> 10:48.700
in your new villain
uniform, Maxie.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.667
- Are there enemies
invading your bunker?

10:50.767 --> 10:53.900
- Uh, yes. You go guard
pirate rock

10:54.000 --> 10:57.033
and I'll go guard
pirate slide.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.067
Get out me secret bunker,
ya scallywag.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.400
- What are you doin'
in here, dorgeous?

11:05.500 --> 11:08.933
- Okay, nothing weird.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.233
- The bird can stay.
You have to go.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.133
- I'm sorry, it's just
I've tried everything

11:14.233 --> 11:16.433
with Link's little brother
and, believe it or not,

11:16.533 --> 11:17.967
he finds me a little boring.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.833
- Buh! Buh! Buh!

11:20.933 --> 11:22.567
So, I told him that this
was my secret bunker

11:22.667 --> 11:24.667
and all of your gadgets
were hidden treasures.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.500
- Yeah, and look how
much fun he's having

11:28.600 --> 11:30.067
wearing the eyepatch.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.167
My evil eyepatch?

11:32.267 --> 11:33.733
- You mean that harmless
little thing on his head

11:33.833 --> 11:35.933
that's glowing
an ominous red color?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.200
That's new.
- Uh-huh.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.267
- So's this!

11:43.433 --> 11:46.967
- Well, at least somebody gets
to sparkle in this place.

11:52.933 --> 11:55.333
- You recreated
Evil Man's eyepatch?

11:55.433 --> 11:57.267
- Now it's sending millions
of hate-filled neurons

11:57.367 --> 11:59.800
right into his innocent
little brain.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.700
Lucky kid.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.400
Harris is like evil now?

12:03.500 --> 12:05.567
The kid doesn't have
an evil bone in his body.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.233
- Uh...

12:07.333 --> 12:08.800
- Evil. Got it.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.800
What smells good?

12:10.900 --> 12:14.333
Whoa, my biscuits
are burning!!!

12:14.433 --> 12:15.933
- Hey, Harris, stop!

12:16.067 --> 12:18.567
That's a custom-made table.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.067
- But it's fun.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.067
Okay, how are we gonna
destroy that eyepatch

12:24.133 --> 12:25.833
without hurting Harris?

12:25.933 --> 12:27.800
- There will be no destroying
the patch, Phoebe.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.800
- Because I had to risk
my life to get that.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.100
I mean, I risked Billy's
life, but still...

12:34.200 --> 12:37.167
lives were risked, Phoebe.

12:37.267 --> 12:39.300
- We have to fix this.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.767
You are the one that
lied to Harris

12:40.867 --> 12:42.333
about this being
your bunker.

12:42.433 --> 12:46.267
- Well...
- It's clearly an evil lair.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.767
- You lied to me--
and froze me?

12:52.867 --> 12:54.300
- Okay, I know that
that sounds bad, but--

12:54.400 --> 12:57.500
Whoa, that is a really
big night light.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.267
- Oh! Colosso, you said
this was fireproof.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.567
- I know and now you have proof
that it catches on fire.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.933
- MAX & PHOEBE: Run!

13:21.233 --> 13:24.067
- Oh, I hope your thundertanium
door holds him off.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.833
Um, are these
notes from Mom?

13:26.933 --> 13:29.333
- No! They're
my evil reminders.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.600
"Put the empty milk carton
back in the fridge."

13:31.700 --> 13:35.267
and "Don't flush the toilet,"
that sort of thing.

13:36.967 --> 13:40.067
This coupon is good for
one Mommy-Maxie hug."

13:40.100 --> 13:45.433
- In my defense,
I never cashed it in.

13:47.733 --> 13:49.567
- No.
- Exactly.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.333
I think he wore
himself out.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.333
- Or Colosso sold us
out and told him

13:53.433 --> 13:55.267
to climb up the slide
and open the hatch.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.333
- He wouldn't
do that, would he?

14:01.067 --> 14:02.567
Oh, no, he's out.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.067
- Thanks a lot, Colosso.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.333
- COLOSSO:
You know what I am.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.533
- Keep your eyes out.
He could be anywhere.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.333
- MAX & PHOEBE:

14:20.767 --> 14:22.967
- Oh, no, it's time for
Harris' surprise party.

14:24.933 --> 14:28.667
- It's time for Harris'
surprise par--

14:28.767 --> 14:32.200
I love surprises!

14:32.300 --> 14:35.433
Did you guys just
ruin the surprise?

14:35.533 --> 14:37.067
- No, not all of it.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.933
We didn't tell you about
the pirates or laser tag or--

14:40.067 --> 14:42.067
I'm gonna stop talking now.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.900
- You ruined
my surprise party

14:44.067 --> 14:45.833
and now I'm gonna ruin
it for everyone else!

14:45.933 --> 14:47.833
- MAX: Oh!

14:47.933 --> 14:49.667
My swoosh! He got my swoosh?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.600
Phoebe, did he hurt
my swoosh?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.067
- Oh, we have to stop Harris

14:55.167 --> 14:56.933
before Link finds
out I turned him evil--

14:57.067 --> 14:58.500
and before anyone gets hurt.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.667
Pretend I said those
in reverse order.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.400
- All right, I just texted
Nora and got us a ride.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.200
All aboard the Chloe Train,
choo-choo!

15:15.267 --> 15:18.533
- Ain't no party
like a laser party!

15:22.533 --> 15:24.633
- Don't head into the arena yet.
Harris isn't here.

15:24.733 --> 15:27.067
We have to yell "surprise!"

15:27.133 --> 15:28.433
- Okay, as soon as
Harris arrives,

15:28.533 --> 15:30.300
we'll isolate him
and destroy the patch.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.133
- We're not destroying
the patch.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.333
You're forgetting that part
and it worries me.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.500
All right.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.867
I can modify one of the laser
taggers to shoot real lasers--

15:41.967 --> 15:43.100
so I can disarm the patch.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.300
- LINK: Stop!
- Link's coming!

15:48.100 --> 15:50.067
- Hey, hey, those
aren't your presents.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.500
This isn't a vacation
for you!

15:54.367 --> 15:56.067
- Thanks to Chloe
we should have

15:56.167 --> 15:57.900
a little bit of time
before Harris shows up.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.767
- All right.
- Or he stole a scooter.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.933
He's here!

16:02.067 --> 16:04.267
- Let's heat this party up.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.933
- Aw, it should be me
all one-eyed and menacing.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.800
- Come on!

16:15.067 --> 16:16.967
- Suit up, Nora.

16:17.067 --> 16:20.200
For one night only,
we're both Laser Girl.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.133
- I told you.
I'm off lasers.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.900
Real ones and fake ones.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.167
Next you're gonna tell me
those teenaged girls

16:29.267 --> 16:32.433
texting on their cell phones
aren't even real pirates.

16:35.267 --> 16:37.867
- So, are you ready
to talk about

16:37.967 --> 16:40.500
this whole
"no powers" thing?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.633
- Nothing to talk about.
I'm retired.

16:42.733 --> 16:45.233
I'm just gonna kick back
and relax--like Dad.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.800
Your father does a lot more

16:46.900 --> 16:49.133
than just
"kick back and relax."

16:55.333 --> 16:58.200
- I think Dad's chair broke.
- No.

16:58.300 --> 17:02.067
I mean why aren't you
using your lasers anymore?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.667
- Mm-hm.

17:03.767 --> 17:05.433
- One of them almost
zapped Chloe.

17:05.533 --> 17:08.533
Oh, I see.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.267
And now you're afraid
to use your superpower.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.433
Honey, I get why
you're scared.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.133
But the answer's
just being more careful,

17:15.233 --> 17:17.333
not giving up
your powers completely.

17:17.433 --> 17:18.800
- I don't know, Mom.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.167
- Well, I do.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.867
You are a superhero, Nora.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.367
There's gonna come a time
when people will need your help

17:25.467 --> 17:28.167
and I know you'll
do the right thing.

17:28.267 --> 17:31.600
If you ever doubt yourself,
just read this.

17:34.267 --> 17:36.900
- "Your heart is bigger
than your swoosh"?

17:37.067 --> 17:39.733
- Oh, sorry,
that one's for Max.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.800
This one's yours.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.333
- "When a hero falls,

17:44.433 --> 17:47.867
it's the getting back
up that makes them super."

17:50.367 --> 17:53.767
- You might need this
note more than I do.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.067
- All right,
I couldn't find Harris

17:59.167 --> 18:00.800
but I know he's
in here somewhere.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.667
- All right. I'm about
to fire real lasers.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.567
Better get these
kids to safety.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.633
- Don't worry. We've got a laser
tag champ clearin' 'em out.

18:06.733 --> 18:13.233
- BILLY: [zooming,
shooting lasers]

18:13.333 --> 18:16.100
Finally, a game
no one can beat me at.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.133
- Yeah, about that.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.700
- Sorry. Don't worry.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.267
Another game starts
in 15 minutes--

18:23.367 --> 18:25.300
if this place
is still standing.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.633
- All right,
now that everyone's out,

18:26.733 --> 18:28.733
where is this freakish
little fireball?

18:28.833 --> 18:31.300
- HARRIS: That was rude!

18:31.400 --> 18:35.067
- MAX: Whoa!

18:35.167 --> 18:37.533
Why does he hate
my clothes?

18:39.733 --> 18:42.500
- Harris, I'm not
gonna fight you, okay?

18:42.600 --> 18:44.067
All I wanted was for
us to be close,

18:44.133 --> 18:46.067
but I took it too far.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.633
This is all my fault.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.633
The lying to me?

18:49.733 --> 18:52.500
The freezing me?
The ruining my surprise?

18:52.600 --> 18:53.867
- Hey, don't forget
about our raven.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.733
He was a "hoot!"

18:55.833 --> 19:00.533
- Shush! Ravens don't hoot
and we are not bonding!

19:00.633 --> 19:02.367
- You're right--we're
blasting that eyepatch

19:02.467 --> 19:04.533
off your adorable
little face.

19:04.633 --> 19:07.567
Oh...

19:07.667 --> 19:10.533
Remember when Phoebe
lied to you?

19:10.633 --> 19:12.433
- I'm about to throw
a fireball at you.

19:12.533 --> 19:17.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I ruin the surprise?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.700
- Ow!

19:24.433 --> 19:27.667
- Of course. We have our own
laser--with a bow on it.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.533
Nora, how did you
know we needed help?

19:29.633 --> 19:32.433
- Billy told me and I knew it
was time to do the right thing.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.833
- Of course you did.
You're a superhero.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.533
- And I'm a supervillain.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.533
- Quick, Nora,
knock off the eyepatch.

19:38.633 --> 19:39.833
- Gently.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.300
- Cute lasers.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.067
I'll call you when
I need a mole removed.

19:48.633 --> 19:51.367
- Let's see if he thinks
this trick shot's cute.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.100
Off the mirror,
off the treasure chest--

19:53.200 --> 19:55.100
- Less yappy, more zappy.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.200
- Nora, you did it!

20:10.667 --> 20:13.367
You were too evil
for this world, Patchy.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.000
- I'm fine now.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.500
Thank you for saving me
from that evil eyepatch.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.767
- Harris, how did you
sneak by us?

20:24.867 --> 20:26.933
I mean, surprise!

20:27.033 --> 20:29.833
Aw, look at you guys.
Oh, let me get a pic.

20:29.933 --> 20:32.067
Here, put these eyepatches on.
- Put those away!

20:32.167 --> 20:33.567
- Never again!

20:33.667 --> 20:35.600
- Okay, well then,
let's get you a piece of cake

20:35.700 --> 20:37.767
and you guys can tell
me all about your day.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.300
- Actually--

20:39.400 --> 20:41.300
- Actually, it was
the best day ever.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.500
I'll save you a seat
next to me, Phoebe.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.567
- Wow, he really likes you.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.033
Guess he really
"warmed up" to me.

20:54.133 --> 20:55.800
- Is there something
burning in here?

20:55.900 --> 20:57.800
- Cake time!

21:00.633 --> 21:03.100
- Well, hope you're proud
of yourself, Nora.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.167
You torched my eyepatch gettin'
your first superhero save.

21:06.267 --> 21:08.467
Try Saves.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.133
You, Phoebe, Harris,
the kids at the party,

21:11.233 --> 21:12.567
probably the whole city.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.267
- Okay, calm down, zappy.
- Cheer up.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.233
You may have lost your patch,

21:17.333 --> 21:19.433
but I think you've found
your new uniform.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.400
Whoa.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.767
You're right.
I look super evil.

21:27.867 --> 21:31.067
Oh, and my swoosh
has totally bounced back.

21:35.867 --> 21:38.133
- Hank, is that a new
mole on your neck?

21:38.233 --> 21:39.500
- Oh, got it.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.900
- Nice to have you back,
Laser Girl.

21:47.567 --> 21:52.233
- CHLOE: What a mess.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.567
- Does somebody want
to explain this?

21:55.667 --> 21:58.067
- Does somebody want
to redeem this?

21:58.133 --> 22:01.633
Mommy-Maxie hug!

22:03.700 --> 22:06.067
- I'll get the broom.
- I'll call animal control.

22:10.900 --> 22:26.433
- *
