00:30.395 --> 00:34.616
We never, ever, had any idea

00:34.900 --> 00:36.652
that this would
be as explosively

00:36.944 --> 00:38.696
successful as it was.

00:45.244 --> 00:47.872
Fastest to Fortune 500

00:48.163 --> 00:51.042
and fastest to over a billion?

00:51.333 --> 00:54.803
I would've just said
you're blowing smoke.

01:01.260 --> 01:05.766
Compaq is the story
of how David takes on Goliath,

01:06.056 --> 01:07.899
and it's not easy,
but when you do it,

01:08.183 --> 01:11.062
it fundamentally
changes society.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.119
We hope you, too,
come to believe that the Compaq

01:19.403 --> 01:21.246
is an important landmark
in the short history

01:21.530 --> 01:23.077
of the personal computer field.

01:23.365 --> 01:24.411
Thank you.

01:26.118 --> 01:27.711
Compaq was basically

01:27.995 --> 01:30.168
prying open a lock box.

01:30.455 --> 01:31.895
It's analogous to somebody

01:32.165 --> 01:35.294
saying we're going to put
Google out of business.

01:35.585 --> 01:37.758
Are you a Mac or a PC?

01:38.046 --> 01:41.641
The reason they don't say Mac
or an IBM is because of Compaq.

01:41.925 --> 01:44.269
You cannot
get to the iPhone without

01:44.553 --> 01:45.713
the original Compaq portable.

01:59.359 --> 02:05.162
Man, if
you're looking for action,

02:05.449 --> 02:08.077
man, Houston's the town.

02:08.368 --> 02:10.245
Here's the action town.

02:10.537 --> 02:11.806
One of the first things

02:11.830 --> 02:13.832
I bought when I got
a real job, which

02:14.124 --> 02:20.598
was a sacker at a grocery
store making $0.45 an hour,

02:20.881 --> 02:27.389
was a '53 Ford for $350.

02:27.679 --> 02:29.039
We'd take our cars
way out to North

02:29.181 --> 02:30.541
Houston where it
was deserted roads

02:30.640 --> 02:33.564
and maybe run a few races.

02:33.852 --> 02:36.571
And I ain't jivin'.

02:36.855 --> 02:38.791
Street drag racing...
Like you see in the movies

02:38.815 --> 02:40.988
where you're going
around Dead Man's Curve.

02:41.276 --> 02:43.779
Man, Houston's the town.

02:44.071 --> 02:46.415
There weren't any video games.

02:46.698 --> 02:49.542
That car was my computer.

02:49.826 --> 02:51.294
I loved working on it.

02:51.578 --> 02:54.582
I'd change spark plugs, and set
the points on the distributor,

02:54.873 --> 02:59.174
and adjust the timing, and
that natural inclination

02:59.461 --> 03:00.883
to try to understand
how it worked

03:01.171 --> 03:05.893
and to not be afraid of taking
it apart and working on it.

03:06.176 --> 03:09.521
I got a lot of
enjoyment out of it.

03:09.805 --> 03:12.308
And Spell, a
revolutionary learning

03:12.599 --> 03:14.021
aid from Texas Instruments.

03:14.309 --> 03:15.310
It almost thinks.

03:15.602 --> 03:17.082
We were very lucky to have

03:17.270 --> 03:20.023
a high tech company, like
Texas Instruments, in Houston.

03:20.315 --> 03:22.168
The learning
can go on with the Texas.

03:22.192 --> 03:23.569
Instruments TI-30.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.658
Specially designed for
high school students

03:25.946 --> 03:29.075
to help them find the Wonder
of numbers never ends.

03:29.366 --> 03:30.843
That's where I wanted to go,

03:30.867 --> 03:33.245
and I got the job and
that really got me started

03:33.537 --> 03:34.537
in high tech electronics.

03:38.542 --> 03:42.012
The bosses asked me to
take a small team of people

03:42.295 --> 03:43.763
to develop an
intelligent terminal.

03:44.047 --> 03:45.299
It was a predecessor to the PC.

03:48.176 --> 03:49.695
He called me up and said, Bill,

03:49.719 --> 03:51.767
would you come work for
me and be my business

03:52.055 --> 03:53.055
development manager?

03:57.602 --> 04:00.151
I came out of Texas A&M,

04:00.439 --> 04:01.639
electrical engineering degree.

04:06.111 --> 04:07.505
Bill was the marketing guy,

04:07.529 --> 04:08.997
and he was a good one.

04:09.281 --> 04:12.626
Jim was the engineering guy, and
even though I was an engineer

04:12.909 --> 04:14.303
by background, I
was really, sort of,

04:14.327 --> 04:16.704
the business guy... the
general manager type.

04:16.997 --> 04:21.127
While Tl was a great
place, as the fun became less

04:21.418 --> 04:25.764
and less over time, Rod and Bill
and I would quip to each other,

04:26.047 --> 04:27.765
like, let's go do something.

04:28.049 --> 04:31.929
We were seeing what was
going on in Silicon Valley.

04:37.809 --> 04:39.169
You wandered around,

04:39.352 --> 04:41.070
there was still a
lot of fruit trees.

04:41.354 --> 04:42.606
It was a lot of empty space.

04:42.898 --> 04:45.367
There was no Silicon Valley
as we think of it today.

04:50.071 --> 04:51.511
It started out as purely

04:51.781 --> 04:54.409
hobbyist, not commercial.

04:54.701 --> 04:56.703
You had to solder
your own connections

04:56.995 --> 04:59.089
and build your kits.

04:59.372 --> 05:01.795
You had the
microprocessor become available

05:02.083 --> 05:03.630
in the very early
1970's, and you

05:03.919 --> 05:08.891
saw a lot of hobbyists coming
up with new ways to use it.

05:09.174 --> 05:10.494
When we were out there

05:10.592 --> 05:14.096
it was just exhilarating
to be around these guys

05:14.387 --> 05:17.891
and to see their enthusiasm.

05:18.183 --> 05:19.952
The VP of
engineering of a small company

05:19.976 --> 05:22.695
would pull up in his
Ferrari, which at Tl you're

05:22.979 --> 05:24.179
never going to have a Ferrari.

05:24.272 --> 05:25.392
Maybe you can rent one once.

05:28.276 --> 05:30.495
What are we doing?

05:30.779 --> 05:32.873
It was like, oh
my goodness, this

05:33.156 --> 05:34.578
is what I would like to do.

05:34.866 --> 05:38.837
Seeded this sense of we ought
to go do something together.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.713
Let's just go do something.

05:40.997 --> 05:42.214
Wasn't about getting rich.

05:42.499 --> 05:45.127
It wasn't about
building a computer.

05:45.418 --> 05:48.672
It was really about
starting a company that

05:48.964 --> 05:50.164
would be a good place to work.

05:52.384 --> 05:53.945
Bill said,
why don't we come over

05:53.969 --> 05:56.813
to my house Thursday at 7:30.

05:57.097 --> 05:59.941
And we said, let's do that.

06:00.225 --> 06:02.023
We can at least have a beer.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.984
We bought a thing called
Entrepreneur's Manual.

06:05.272 --> 06:06.872
Because surely that'll
tell us how to put

06:07.148 --> 06:08.570
together a successful company.

06:08.858 --> 06:10.818
We sit at a table, we each
have our piece of paper

06:10.902 --> 06:12.582
with us and a pen, and
we're going to start

06:12.779 --> 06:14.019
taking notes about what we say.

06:14.197 --> 06:18.077
It's like,
OK, what do we do now?

06:18.368 --> 06:21.087
Let's talk
about all the possibilities.

06:21.371 --> 06:22.748
One of the things
we did, sort of,

06:23.039 --> 06:25.239
traditionally, was we would
go out and eat Mexican food.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.922
Pepe's Tacos restaurants.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.712
Treat yourself to
the wonderful world

06:29.004 --> 06:31.803
of Mexican food and
authentic Mexican atmosphere.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.592
Bill and I always wanted

06:33.883 --> 06:37.353
to do a Mexican food restaurant,
so we brought that up.

06:37.637 --> 06:39.731
Maybe a Mexican food restaurant.

06:40.015 --> 06:41.535
We didn't really want to do

06:41.683 --> 06:42.900
a Mexican food restaurant.

06:43.184 --> 06:45.144
What a stupid
idea that would've been.

06:45.395 --> 06:46.706
Pepe's Tacos restaurants

06:46.730 --> 06:48.232
are the family fun place to be.

06:48.523 --> 06:52.403
We finally decided,
as you would hope, I guess,

06:52.694 --> 06:56.198
that we ought to stick
with what We knew.

06:56.489 --> 07:00.244
And we toasted the beginning
of starting a company.

07:00.535 --> 07:02.015
You're probably on your way

07:02.120 --> 07:03.997
up to the top of the ladder.

07:04.289 --> 07:06.257
Texas Instruments,
a terrific company.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.477
And you did a silly thing
like quit to try to start

07:08.501 --> 07:09.541
your own computer company.

07:09.753 --> 07:12.632
People must have
thought you were nuts.

07:12.922 --> 07:14.720
We went to the credit unions

07:15.008 --> 07:16.134
and took out loans.

07:16.426 --> 07:18.349
I knew that
I could last 6 months

07:18.637 --> 07:20.389
after I sold my Wife's car.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.809
I had three
small children, and a Wife,

07:24.100 --> 07:25.727
and mortgage.

07:26.019 --> 07:28.772
I'd actually,
recently married Rhonda.

07:29.064 --> 07:31.658
I was meeting a lot of
her extended family,

07:31.941 --> 07:33.693
and it would be
like, what do you do?

07:33.985 --> 07:36.738
Well, I've actually left my job,
and I want to start a company.

07:37.030 --> 07:38.030
Oh, that's great.

07:38.281 --> 07:39.703
What is that going to be?

07:39.991 --> 07:42.289
Well, we hadn't decided yet.

07:42.577 --> 07:43.794
And you quit your job?

07:44.079 --> 07:45.331
Yes.

07:45.622 --> 07:47.624
And you could tell they
were thinking, poor Rhonda.

07:55.006 --> 07:56.349
The success of IBM had

07:56.633 --> 08:00.228
come about through
mainframe computers.

08:00.512 --> 08:03.061
IBM was making big computers

08:03.348 --> 08:06.693
to sell to big companies.

08:06.976 --> 08:09.729
Computers
were treated as a priesthood,

08:10.021 --> 08:11.864
and only the priests
could touch them,

08:12.148 --> 08:15.072
and everyone else looked
through a glass wall.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.158
Eventually, the
users wanted to get

08:17.445 --> 08:20.949
hold of that computing power.

08:21.241 --> 08:22.843
IBM wanted to maintain control

08:22.867 --> 08:24.335
over the computing
industry as they

08:24.619 --> 08:26.462
had during the 60's and 70's.

08:26.746 --> 08:28.146
Let's build something
for the masses

08:28.289 --> 08:29.889
that they can buy and
become a commodity.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.885
Everyone else was struggling

08:33.169 --> 08:36.890
to get a permanent foothold.

08:37.173 --> 08:42.554
First PCs, Apple ll,
Commodore, RadioShack...

08:42.846 --> 08:45.599
It was still a tiny market.

08:45.890 --> 08:52.694
The game changer was when IBM
entered the market in '81.

08:52.981 --> 08:55.154
IBM, International
Business Machines,

08:55.442 --> 08:58.491
has entered the small computer
market for the first time.

08:58.778 --> 09:00.530
It's expected to
have a major impact

09:00.822 --> 09:02.916
on what is now the
fastest growing sector

09:03.199 --> 09:04.200
of the computer business.

09:04.492 --> 09:05.803
IBM said, we're going

09:05.827 --> 09:08.876
to go from selling
million dollar computers

09:09.164 --> 09:11.417
to a few thousand people,
to $1000 computers

09:11.708 --> 09:12.708
to a few million people.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.154
IBM's personal computer

09:14.294 --> 09:16.638
is designed for office,
school, or home use.

09:16.921 --> 09:20.095
It's aimed at exactly the same
market as its competitors.

09:20.383 --> 09:22.431
It's expected to be
sold very aggressively.

09:22.719 --> 09:23.999
And the race was on.

09:24.137 --> 09:27.107
This was going to cause
that market to explode.

09:27.390 --> 09:28.910
Sales of personal computers

09:29.058 --> 09:31.339
are so hot this Christmas,
Santa Claus may have to replace

09:31.478 --> 09:33.071
his reindeer with microchips.

09:33.354 --> 09:35.573
850,000 people
bought home computers

09:35.857 --> 09:37.575
in the United States last year.

09:37.859 --> 09:40.783
<i>The industry expects, this
year, more than 3 million will.</i>

09:41.070 --> 09:42.590
We're no longer on the verge

09:42.697 --> 09:44.244
of the personal
computer revolution,

09:44.532 --> 09:46.732
we're right in the midst of
it with more and more people

09:46.910 --> 09:49.459
jumping aboard every day.

09:49.746 --> 09:51.999
Osborne was
being very successful

09:52.290 --> 09:54.668
with an extraordinarily
ugly portable.

09:54.959 --> 09:57.303
And Rod had
purchased the IBM PC,

09:57.587 --> 10:01.262
so he could write
business plans on it,

10:01.549 --> 10:04.678
and it became obvious
to him that that PC,

10:04.969 --> 10:07.142
if it was portable, that
would be a good product.

10:07.430 --> 10:09.023
What popped in
my head was, well,

10:09.307 --> 10:13.232
if we could take this
idea for a portable,

10:13.520 --> 10:14.914
and we could make it
run the software that

10:14.938 --> 10:18.738
was written for the IBM
PC, ooh, that's when

10:19.025 --> 10:20.185
the chill went down my spine.

10:20.235 --> 10:23.284
It's like, oh, man,
would that sell.

10:27.075 --> 10:28.435
Welcome to the
Computer Chronicles.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.754
I'm Stewart Cheifet and
this is Gary Kildall.

10:31.037 --> 10:34.166
And, Gary, our subject today
is IBM and the dominant role

10:34.457 --> 10:36.097
they play in the
computer world in general

10:36.292 --> 10:37.532
and the PC world in particular.

10:37.794 --> 10:39.480
Matter of fact, they've
taken over the phrase PC.

10:39.504 --> 10:40.898
It doesn't mean personal
computer anymore,

10:40.922 --> 10:42.720
it means an IBM
personal computer.

10:43.007 --> 10:45.977
IBM has always had
this mentality that it

10:46.261 --> 10:47.604
is the king of the world.

10:47.887 --> 10:50.060
What do you think would be
the biggest threat to IBM's

10:50.348 --> 10:51.565
position in this situation?

10:51.850 --> 10:54.103
Well, I don't think
that anything is really

10:54.394 --> 10:56.192
a threat to the
IBM position, and I

10:56.479 --> 10:59.779
don't anticipate that they
will begin to decline.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.066
IBM didn't care.

11:04.445 --> 11:07.119
If you weren't Xerox, if you
didn't have that massive, New

11:07.407 --> 11:09.830
York, type presence that
loomed over the entire country,

11:10.118 --> 11:11.118
you didn't matter.

11:14.706 --> 11:16.809
We weren't really
good at writing business plans,

11:16.833 --> 11:18.394
but We knew that the
way a product looked

11:18.418 --> 11:20.091
was important to people.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.458
Ted Papa John
was an industrial designer,

11:22.547 --> 11:25.471
and we got him, and we drove
over to the House of Pies

11:25.758 --> 11:26.758
for two things.

11:26.926 --> 11:28.473
One, a piece of
pie, and the other

11:28.761 --> 11:32.231
was to convey to Ted
our ideals for what

11:32.515 --> 11:34.893
the unit may look like.

11:35.184 --> 11:37.607
We walked in,
looked around, picked a booth

11:37.896 --> 11:39.898
that was kind of by itself.

11:40.189 --> 11:42.509
Unfortunately, We hadn't thought
to bring anything with us,

11:42.734 --> 11:45.533
so we turned over the
placemat and borrowed a pencil

11:45.820 --> 11:50.371
from the waitress, and proceeded
to describe to Ted Papa John

11:50.658 --> 11:53.207
how We wanted it to look.

11:53.494 --> 11:55.667
What he drew was something that

11:55.955 --> 11:57.298
was very professional looking.

11:57.582 --> 11:59.755
We knew where the monitor
would go, what the size was,

12:00.043 --> 12:02.887
how the keyboard would go in.

12:03.171 --> 12:05.219
Laid out
somewhat like an Osborne

12:05.506 --> 12:08.225
but with much smoother
lines, plastic molded case,

12:08.509 --> 12:12.184
keyboard just like an IBM PC.

12:12.472 --> 12:16.067
As I saw that sketch coming
together on the paper,

12:16.351 --> 12:18.979
there was an excitement.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.522
We're going to make this work.

12:20.813 --> 12:24.363
I didn't know how yet, but
it was headed that way.

12:24.651 --> 12:26.251
This is something We
can get funding for.

12:33.910 --> 12:36.504
Post Mark
Zuckerberg inventing Facebook

12:36.788 --> 12:38.756
in high school, there is
this different path which

12:39.040 --> 12:42.965
is oh, if I study this
stuff and I learn computers,

12:43.252 --> 12:45.300
I can move to Palo Alto
when I graduate college,

12:45.588 --> 12:48.182
and there's just money
raining from the sky.

12:48.466 --> 12:50.218
Uber growth at Uber.

12:50.510 --> 12:52.529
Reuters has learned that
the ride sharing service see

12:52.553 --> 12:55.102
its global bookings more
than tripling this year

12:55.390 --> 12:57.108
to nearly $11 billion dollars.

12:57.392 --> 12:59.360
A picture is
worth a thousand words,

12:59.644 --> 13:02.363
and for Instagram,
a billion dollars.

13:02.647 --> 13:04.807
SnapChat, the
barely three-year-old company,

13:04.941 --> 13:09.071
raised almost half a billion
dollars in investment funding.

13:09.362 --> 13:11.215
There's just
so much venture capital.

13:11.239 --> 13:13.583
Back then, there
wasn't that much.

13:13.866 --> 13:15.594
If you wanted to
start a computer company,

13:15.618 --> 13:18.747
there was literally nobody.

13:19.038 --> 13:21.882
You had to go get a bank loan,
you had to have collateral.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.727
If you weren't walking in,

13:23.751 --> 13:26.095
in a suit... a nice
suit, and a tie,

13:26.379 --> 13:29.474
and you had this education,
and you had this background,

13:29.757 --> 13:31.634
and this many decades
of experience,

13:31.926 --> 13:34.645
nobody wanted to
even listen to you.

13:34.929 --> 13:38.729
We received
an introduction to meet.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.394
Rod, Bill, and Jim in Houston.

13:43.479 --> 13:46.983
Their business plan had a
sketch of the portable computer

13:47.275 --> 13:49.653
on the back of a placemat
from the House of Pies.

13:49.944 --> 13:54.666
And they showed for first
year sales of $30 million.

13:54.949 --> 13:57.247
Now, that was absurd.

13:57.535 --> 14:00.709
You're taking a chance on
somebody from a big company

14:00.997 --> 14:04.376
starting a new company.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.591
It's whether it's a gut
feeling or something

14:07.879 --> 14:10.052
about the discussion
you have with them

14:10.339 --> 14:12.717
that you feel is going
to help differentiate

14:13.009 --> 14:16.639
them from other people.

14:16.929 --> 14:19.398
Rod obviously had some skills,

14:19.682 --> 14:20.784
but he had clear weaknesses.

14:20.808 --> 14:21.980
He wasn't a public speaker.

14:22.268 --> 14:25.943
He didn't have the brash,
over-the-top demeanor

14:26.230 --> 14:28.904
that we now associate
with tech entrepreneurs.

14:29.192 --> 14:32.742
He was modest, he was
extremely clean cut,

14:33.029 --> 14:37.079
he was thoughtful... almost
like a Boy Scout, right.

14:37.366 --> 14:40.620
Pretty much everybody who
met him was drawn to him.

14:55.802 --> 14:58.931
We were basically
in this class B office space,

14:59.222 --> 15:02.692
and it was right next
to a field full of cows.

15:02.975 --> 15:04.255
We had no furniture.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.187
There was one phone line.

15:06.479 --> 15:08.040
I brought
my card table and chairs.

15:08.064 --> 15:10.567
So we put
a very long cord on it.

15:10.858 --> 15:12.075
It didn't matter who did what.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.033
I don't even know
who reported to who.

15:14.320 --> 15:19.167
I ain't
jivin' when I say Houston,

15:19.450 --> 15:20.702
here's the action town.

15:20.993 --> 15:22.805
The people
that I wanted to work with

15:22.829 --> 15:24.709
were the people that were
coming to this company

15:24.747 --> 15:26.767
that was making a product,
and I didn't know what it was.

15:26.791 --> 15:29.044
I couldn't tell
them what the product was.

15:29.335 --> 15:30.632
It was secret.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.523
I assumed it
was in the electronics.

15:32.547 --> 15:34.049
I didn't know if it
was a toy, I don't

15:34.340 --> 15:35.387
know if it was a computer.

15:35.675 --> 15:37.027
Was it a sewing machine?

15:37.051 --> 15:37.643
Or a PC?

15:37.927 --> 15:40.350
It really didn't matter.

15:40.638 --> 15:44.063
Once I signed a nondisclosure,
and I Walked the halls,

15:44.350 --> 15:45.994
they showed me what the
product looked like.

15:46.018 --> 15:48.112
They showed us the picture

15:48.396 --> 15:51.400
of the Compaq computer
that we were gonna build

15:51.691 --> 15:52.692
and that did it.

15:52.984 --> 15:54.264
It was exciting.

15:54.318 --> 15:56.286
It was like, OK, we can do this.

15:56.571 --> 15:57.571
This is a cool thing.

15:57.613 --> 15:58.956
I would like to own that thing.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.584
I would love to have that,
that's better than anything

16:01.868 --> 16:03.211
I've seen on the market.

16:03.494 --> 16:05.872
Man, Houston's the town.

16:06.164 --> 16:07.164
Here's the action town.

16:11.377 --> 16:13.737
Get your iPhone,
you look at the half million

16:13.838 --> 16:15.158
apps that each of
us has on there,

16:15.423 --> 16:18.347
and you look at
all of the products

16:18.634 --> 16:22.389
designed for other platforms
that miraculously seem to work.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.605
And We now take
that for granted.

16:26.893 --> 16:29.567
Before Compaq, nobody took
compatibility seriously.

16:32.815 --> 16:35.034
Gary, the subject
today is the IBM clones,

16:35.318 --> 16:37.254
and the question I get asked
more than anything else

16:37.278 --> 16:38.998
by people who are about
to buy computers is,

16:39.238 --> 16:42.117
should I buy an IBM, or should
I buy one of the IBM lookalikes?

16:42.408 --> 16:44.160
I think I'm told there's
about 50 IBM clones

16:44.452 --> 16:45.572
out there on the market now.

16:45.703 --> 16:47.103
What's the difference,
do you think,

16:47.288 --> 16:49.266
between a clone that makes
it and a clone that fails?

16:49.290 --> 16:51.042
We didn't want to do

16:51.334 --> 16:54.178
a better machine than
IBM, We didn't want

16:54.462 --> 16:56.009
to technically be superior.

16:56.297 --> 16:59.517
We wanted the software
to run the same.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.552
The keystrokes were identical,

17:01.844 --> 17:03.846
you didn't have to look
at a different manual,

17:04.137 --> 17:05.685
there was no training required.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.646
You just sat in front of
it, and it worked the same.

17:08.935 --> 17:10.615
It wasn't some vague definition

17:10.728 --> 17:13.823
of what does compatibility
mean... it was very clear.

17:14.106 --> 17:15.826
We have to run all the
software, and use all

17:15.983 --> 17:17.183
the peripherals that IBM does.

17:22.698 --> 17:26.748
Do you have any idea how
expensive this thing was?

17:27.036 --> 17:28.316
Let's turn this
thing inside out.

17:28.537 --> 17:29.848
<i>"Halt & Catch Fire"</i>

17:29.872 --> 17:31.419
is a show about the
reverse engineering

17:31.707 --> 17:34.130
process of the IBM PC.

17:34.418 --> 17:37.968
The thing that really drew us to
Texas was the story of Compaq.

17:38.256 --> 17:40.975
You've got characters that,
for all intents and purposes,

17:41.259 --> 17:45.560
feel like outlaws, and they're
coming in to take on IBM.

17:45.846 --> 17:48.224
And they basically do
it by robbing a bank.

17:48.516 --> 17:53.113
Nobody ever got fired
for buying an IBM, right?

17:53.396 --> 17:55.524
You can be more.

17:55.815 --> 17:57.567
This is your chance.

17:57.858 --> 18:00.611
What we knew was
that IBM had come

18:00.903 --> 18:05.158
out with a product that was made
with off the shelf components.

18:05.449 --> 18:07.543
A personal computer,
like any other computer,

18:07.827 --> 18:09.747
is just a nothing box full
of electronic switches

18:09.996 --> 18:11.088
and hardware.

18:11.372 --> 18:12.043
They hadn't designed a new disk

18:12.331 --> 18:13.753
drive or a new processor.

18:14.041 --> 18:16.161
Anyone can buy all this
stuff off the shelf right now.

18:16.252 --> 18:18.105
This was stuff
that everybody in the industry

18:18.129 --> 18:19.472
was using some form or another.

18:19.755 --> 18:21.177
Except the chip.

18:21.465 --> 18:22.682
Except what's on the chip.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.969
Without
IBM code it wouldn't run.

18:25.261 --> 18:27.514
It is the program,
it is the magic.

18:27.805 --> 18:33.062
We sent Gary Stimac
to Dallas to buy some manuals.

18:33.352 --> 18:35.525
I purchased
an IBM reference manual,

18:35.813 --> 18:39.158
and it had all the listings
of the IBM code in it.

18:39.442 --> 18:42.321
He says, whoa,
this isn't hard at all.

18:42.611 --> 18:45.205
Bad news is they copyrighted
it, and they own how it Works.

18:45.489 --> 18:47.129
I circled the word copyright,

18:47.366 --> 18:49.710
brought it to the my
lawyer, and he said, hmm.

18:49.994 --> 18:51.972
What many of
the companies were doing was

18:51.996 --> 18:55.341
they were copying IBM's code.

18:55.624 --> 18:58.218
Guess what, IBM sued them...
Out of business they were.

18:58.502 --> 19:01.927
Good news is there's a
way around that, sort of.

19:02.214 --> 19:03.591
We needed to make
sure that we did

19:03.883 --> 19:06.136
not shoot ourselves in the
foot from a legal standpoint.

19:06.427 --> 19:10.523
I said, Gary, you can
no longer write the code

19:10.806 --> 19:12.103
because you've looked at it.

19:12.391 --> 19:15.520
In fact, you can't answer
questions about the code.

19:15.811 --> 19:18.171
You're going to have to find a
different job here at Compaq.

19:18.397 --> 19:20.797
You can never
look, you just can never look.

19:20.941 --> 19:23.785
If you look, and it
influences your work,

19:24.070 --> 19:27.449
then you can be open to a
lawsuit and you've copied it.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.038
No one in the entire office

19:30.326 --> 19:32.294
could ever buy a
tech reference manual

19:32.578 --> 19:36.754
without me removing the
pages and me destroying them.

19:37.041 --> 19:40.136
We had to basically
create a functional device that

19:40.419 --> 19:42.217
would do what the IBM
PC did without knowing

19:42.505 --> 19:44.803
how the IBM PC did it.

19:45.091 --> 19:48.095
Would be similar to playing
baseball blindfolded.

19:48.386 --> 19:51.265
Very difficult, not
impossible, but very difficult.

19:51.555 --> 19:53.432
So you might strike
out a couple times,

19:53.724 --> 19:56.102
and you might fall
down a couple times,

19:56.394 --> 19:58.675
but eventually you're going
to start to get a feel for it,

19:58.771 --> 20:00.114
and you start getting a hit.

20:00.398 --> 20:03.242
How many of these addresses
do we need to transcribe?

20:03.526 --> 20:05.324
65,536.

20:05.611 --> 20:06.797
We went out and got all

20:06.821 --> 20:08.118
the IBM software we could find.

20:08.406 --> 20:10.704
Everything we could find...
Games, or Lotus 1-2-3,

20:10.991 --> 20:13.119
or unimportant, really
important, all of it.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.754
We got every bit we could find.

20:15.037 --> 20:16.957
We would go through and run them

20:17.206 --> 20:19.476
until something broke, and
then we'd figure out well, what

20:19.500 --> 20:21.753
broke, and why did it break.

20:22.044 --> 20:23.387
We liked the idea

20:23.671 --> 20:26.265
of what Compaq was trying
to do a lot because

20:26.549 --> 20:27.971
of the PC compatibility.

20:28.259 --> 20:29.727
We thought it was
the right idea.

20:30.010 --> 20:33.014
We were rooting for it,
but nobody really knew

20:33.305 --> 20:34.773
how it was going to come out.

20:35.057 --> 20:37.776
We're IBM, and We've
seen some very skeptical people

20:38.060 --> 20:39.903
become very enthusiastic.

20:40.187 --> 20:42.155
And that makes us
proud because we

20:42.440 --> 20:46.490
have more computers helping more
small businesses than anybody.

20:46.777 --> 20:48.324
So at IBM there was always

20:48.612 --> 20:51.582
this arrogance, this
confidence, that no one

20:51.866 --> 20:53.288
could recreate what we did.

20:53.576 --> 20:55.044
And if they did,
we could just we

20:55.327 --> 20:56.874
could just tweak
something because we

20:57.163 --> 20:58.710
controlled the marketplace.

20:58.998 --> 21:00.998
IBM entered the
personal computer market

21:01.125 --> 21:03.423
two years ago and went
all out unleashing

21:03.711 --> 21:06.260
its power as the sixth
largest industrial corporation

21:06.547 --> 21:07.547
in the US.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.158
Already, the computer
giant has Won

21:09.425 --> 21:11.678
25% of the personal
computer market,

21:11.969 --> 21:13.266
and its share is growing.

21:23.189 --> 21:28.537
Compaq... they were
prying open a lock box,

21:28.819 --> 21:31.288
and they were letting the
genie out of the bottle.

21:35.242 --> 21:38.621
I was extremely
excited and scared to death

21:38.913 --> 21:40.433
because I was the
one that had to stand

21:40.498 --> 21:44.969
up and make this speech,
which I had never done before.

21:45.252 --> 21:48.631
Rod was not
experienced in dealing

21:48.923 --> 21:50.220
with the public and the press.

21:50.508 --> 21:51.818
Ben had made sure

21:51.842 --> 21:53.640
everybody that
mattered was there.

21:53.928 --> 21:55.180
TV cameras were there.

21:55.471 --> 21:57.157
We're in this beautiful
old room called The Library

21:57.181 --> 21:58.649
at the Helmsley Palace.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.731
Good morning and welcome.

22:01.018 --> 22:02.778
My name is Rod Canton,
and I am the president

22:03.020 --> 22:05.819
of Compaq Computer
Corporation of Houston.

22:06.106 --> 22:07.746
The mysterious company
you've been invited

22:07.942 --> 22:09.785
to come and hear about today.

22:10.069 --> 22:12.339
I spent
most of the night practicing,

22:12.363 --> 22:14.161
changing, practicing, changing.

22:14.448 --> 22:16.166
This is an important day for us.

22:16.450 --> 22:19.670
The public introduction of a new
personal computer that has been

22:19.954 --> 22:21.194
in development for nine months.

22:21.330 --> 22:22.766
It was the big city

22:22.790 --> 22:27.045
and we were the kids
from the plains of Texas.

22:27.336 --> 22:29.509
There's a three piece
suit, and my thick glasses,

22:29.797 --> 22:31.219
and we looked out of place.

22:31.507 --> 22:34.636
This is the Compaq
Portable Computer.

22:34.927 --> 22:38.522
The unit is laid over smoothly
using its carrying handle,

22:38.806 --> 22:41.025
and the keyboard is removed
by sliding two latches

22:41.308 --> 22:43.777
and lifting it out.

22:44.061 --> 22:47.065
That's how easy it is to
get it ready for operation.

22:47.356 --> 22:50.326
It was a portable
and that was something

22:50.609 --> 22:55.615
IBM had no entrant in at
all, and it was 27 pounds.

22:55.906 --> 23:00.662
Portability... people need
to be able to take it anyway.

23:00.953 --> 23:02.125
It's going to have a handle.

23:02.413 --> 23:03.807
It was simultaneously

23:03.831 --> 23:06.550
an incredibly revolutionary
idea but sounds so

23:06.834 --> 23:08.962
mundane to today's audiences.

23:09.253 --> 23:10.379
A handle, wow.

23:10.671 --> 23:12.765
It is the only
personal computer,

23:13.048 --> 23:16.803
portable or otherwise, that is
truly compatible with the IBM

23:17.094 --> 23:18.596
personal computer.

23:18.887 --> 23:20.810
I begin to really
realize, this is it.

23:21.098 --> 23:23.338
The flag was going down, and
the race was going to begin.

23:23.517 --> 23:27.021
I repeat, Compaq is the only
personal computer that is truly

23:27.313 --> 23:29.532
compatible with the IBM PC.

23:34.528 --> 23:35.964
This was just
a blip on the screen.

23:35.988 --> 23:38.411
Who cares about a luggable?

23:38.699 --> 23:40.827
It just doesn't
matter, it's a toy.

23:41.118 --> 23:43.712
It's a curiosity...
It's nothing more.

23:43.996 --> 23:46.016
While some software
computer firms are battling

23:46.040 --> 23:47.508
to succeed, one
personal computer

23:47.791 --> 23:49.338
company is more
concerned with taking

23:49.627 --> 23:51.800
its hardware success forward.

23:52.087 --> 23:54.431
Our company
is real all of a sudden.

23:54.715 --> 23:58.094
We have a name,
we're on the radio.

23:58.385 --> 23:59.785
We're getting calls

23:59.887 --> 24:01.767
from presidents, and CEOs,
and engineers saying,

24:01.972 --> 24:03.349
this is a cool machine.

24:03.641 --> 24:06.144
What I brought today is a
Compaq portable computer.

24:06.435 --> 24:10.281
It's a full functioning computer
in a portable enclosure.

24:10.564 --> 24:13.534
People were
walking with portable computers

24:13.817 --> 24:16.696
down the aisles of
airplanes, and the computer

24:16.987 --> 24:18.364
was hitting people in the head.

24:18.656 --> 24:19.966
We didn't hardly
have a chance to breathe...

24:19.990 --> 24:20.990
People loved the product.

24:21.241 --> 24:22.601
We couldn't build
them fast enough.

24:22.868 --> 24:25.792
Trying to use
portable computers, which

24:26.080 --> 24:27.457
were not laptops at that point.

24:27.748 --> 24:30.752
They were sewing machines on
the meal tray of airplanes.

24:31.043 --> 24:34.638
The company's first product was
a 28 pound portable computer.

24:34.922 --> 24:37.596
The salesman used to
demonstrate how rugged it is

24:37.883 --> 24:39.180
by taking it and dropping it.

24:41.261 --> 24:42.541
What Compaq did,

24:42.638 --> 24:45.892
because they built
things so damn well,

24:46.183 --> 24:51.690
is they quickly went up to be an
acceptable alternative to IBM.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.540
Its founders decided early on

24:53.649 --> 24:55.492
to build machines
compatible with those built

24:55.776 --> 24:57.699
by IBM but with new features.

24:57.986 --> 24:59.784
Market research showed
customers want it.

25:00.072 --> 25:01.216
Sometimes people

25:01.240 --> 25:02.560
wanted to go home
over the weekend

25:02.616 --> 25:04.414
and finish their
work before Monday.

25:04.702 --> 25:05.703
They grabbed a portable.

25:05.994 --> 25:08.338
That really turned
out to be important.

25:08.622 --> 25:10.920
Product was
just flying off the shelves,

25:11.208 --> 25:12.425
and the dealers loved it.

25:12.710 --> 25:14.479
Salespeople
already familiar with IBM

25:14.503 --> 25:16.050
products didn't
need much training

25:16.338 --> 25:18.136
to sell Compaq computers.

25:18.424 --> 25:21.598
We meet a Computer
Land dealer in a little motel,

25:21.885 --> 25:24.980
and there's no wall receptacle.

25:25.264 --> 25:27.767
How am I gonna plug this in?
, Well, the bathroom has one.

25:28.058 --> 25:31.437
OK, so we put the computer
on the toilet seat,

25:31.729 --> 25:35.654
and We plug it in, and it ran.

25:35.941 --> 25:37.067
And they went, Wow!

25:37.359 --> 25:40.203
The challenge
was building computers

25:40.487 --> 25:41.955
fast enough to meet the demand.

25:42.239 --> 25:45.914
We had no idea that it was
going to be as big as it was.

25:46.201 --> 25:48.321
We're cutting back on
advertising... we can't cut back

25:48.370 --> 25:52.091
on advertising, and Rod
said, well, let me make this

25:52.374 --> 25:54.502
really clear... we're sold out.

25:54.793 --> 25:56.273
Compaq Computer Corporation

25:56.378 --> 25:58.927
delivered its first
portable personal computer

25:59.214 --> 26:01.091
in January of 1983.

26:01.383 --> 26:04.637
By the end of the year, the
firm had sold $111 million

26:04.928 --> 26:06.145
worth of the machines.

26:06.430 --> 26:08.398
A figure that company
executives say

26:08.682 --> 26:11.151
exceeded the first
year sales of any firm

26:11.435 --> 26:13.529
in American business history.

26:13.812 --> 26:15.165
That was the first time where

26:15.189 --> 26:17.191
there was a ripple at IBM.

26:17.483 --> 26:19.843
That being said, we had seen
other people come in... Amdahl,

26:20.110 --> 26:22.408
Hitachi... and they
come and they rise,

26:22.696 --> 26:24.664
and then they go back down.

26:24.948 --> 26:28.043
And We will defeat
them in the end.

26:39.463 --> 26:44.936
There was kind of a feeling
that something was going on

26:45.219 --> 26:48.644
out there with respect
to the PC world

26:48.931 --> 26:51.229
and somehow or other
IBM wasn't getting

26:51.517 --> 26:53.019
the share that it wanted.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.870
Now, I know IBM was
getting a big share,

26:54.978 --> 26:56.355
but they wanted more.

26:56.647 --> 26:59.571
And so people started paying
a little bit of attention.

26:59.858 --> 27:03.533
With a clone that is actually
offering more portability,

27:03.821 --> 27:07.792
for example, becomes a
successful notion like that,

27:08.075 --> 27:11.579
then isn't it the case that IBM
would or even has gone in there

27:11.870 --> 27:14.544
and taken that market
to some extent?

27:14.832 --> 27:17.631
That's the danger of playing
the IBM compatible game.

27:17.918 --> 27:21.138
There was complete conviction
among the Wall Street

27:21.421 --> 27:23.298
public and the press public.

27:23.590 --> 27:25.809
Well, enjoy it while
you can because IBM

27:26.093 --> 27:29.347
is going to have a portable
and then it's sayonara.

27:29.638 --> 27:31.436
Wall Street hit a
record high again today.

27:31.723 --> 27:34.897
One of the better performers was
IBM, up more than five points

27:35.185 --> 27:36.232
this week alone.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.648
One of the reasons
is IBM's huge success

27:38.939 --> 27:41.408
in the tough home computer
market, and the rumor

27:41.692 --> 27:42.772
that there is more to come.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.453
What was IBM going
to do, and when

27:44.736 --> 27:48.661
was it going to actually happen,
and how successful would it be?

27:48.949 --> 27:51.293
We were
always concerned about IBM.

27:51.577 --> 27:53.817
I think anyone
else in the computer business

27:53.912 --> 27:57.382
ought to be very frightened,
and I think everyone else is.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.088
IBM was arrogant.

27:59.376 --> 28:05.133
Some manager got PO'd at us and
said, kind of like a hitman,

28:05.424 --> 28:09.054
go design a portable and take
those guys out... tired of them.

28:09.344 --> 28:10.944
The Compaq personal computer's

28:11.096 --> 28:15.067
main selling point is its high
compatibility with the IBM PC.

28:15.350 --> 28:18.980
Yet IBM is now bringing its own
portable PC to the marketplace.

28:22.065 --> 28:23.545
It's called the FUD Factor.

28:23.692 --> 28:26.445
F-U-D for the fear,
uncertainty, and doubt created

28:26.737 --> 28:28.956
among its rivals by IBM.

28:29.239 --> 28:31.082
Will there be life for
other home computers

28:31.366 --> 28:34.119
after giant IBM's
product appeared?

28:34.411 --> 28:36.004
What nobody outside
the company knew

28:36.288 --> 28:38.211
is that we had no
orders coming in,

28:38.498 --> 28:41.752
so this wasn't really a
future hypothetical problem,

28:42.044 --> 28:43.364
this was an immediate
problem that

28:43.503 --> 28:44.583
was threatening to kill us.

28:47.341 --> 28:49.059
Compaq's stock went down

28:49.343 --> 28:51.311
because they were
concerned that IBM would

28:51.595 --> 28:52.675
put Compaq out of business.

28:55.807 --> 28:58.230
Compaq was the
first one in with the luggable.

28:58.518 --> 29:01.442
IBM put two products,
essentially, in there,

29:01.730 --> 29:03.107
and it doesn't do
nearly as well.

29:10.614 --> 29:14.244
They didn't
really try to make it better

29:14.534 --> 29:17.708
and try to meet
Compaq's advances

29:17.996 --> 29:19.213
in technology and performance.

29:19.498 --> 29:23.469
Their product would not
run all the software...

29:23.752 --> 29:27.097
Their IBM software,
even their IBM software

29:27.381 --> 29:32.182
people did to run
in their computers

29:32.469 --> 29:35.643
would not necessarily
run in their portable.

29:35.931 --> 29:37.291
But you could take
that same thing,

29:37.391 --> 29:40.144
and put it in our
portable, and it would run.

29:40.435 --> 29:41.778
How could that be?

29:42.062 --> 29:44.611
Of course IBM at the time
did the only obvious thing,

29:44.898 --> 29:46.150
and they blamed the user.

29:46.441 --> 29:48.443
You're not doing it
correctly, and the user said,

29:48.735 --> 29:50.703
I may be dumb, but
I'm not stupid.

29:50.988 --> 29:53.241
Why don't you come back to me
when you've got it figured.

29:53.532 --> 29:58.459
I had heard from friends
of friends inside IBM

29:58.745 --> 30:02.545
that there was a lot of
discussion and turmoil

30:02.833 --> 30:04.085
within their PC ranks.

30:04.376 --> 30:06.219
Why is this happening?

30:06.503 --> 30:08.756
Why is this little
company out-marketing us?

30:17.889 --> 30:19.534
They've done a
little growing since they

30:19.558 --> 30:21.526
began in February of '82.

30:21.810 --> 30:23.812
They had 6 employees then.

30:24.104 --> 30:26.323
They have 950 now.

30:26.606 --> 30:28.108
Two years ago, they
occupied the space

30:28.400 --> 30:30.027
on one floor of this building.

30:30.318 --> 30:33.913
By spring, it'll look like
this in one of their locations.

30:34.197 --> 30:36.620
Well, production is up 1600%.

30:36.908 --> 30:38.831
The worry now is they
won't get enough workers

30:39.119 --> 30:40.336
to keep up the pace.

30:40.620 --> 30:41.917
If you'd like to
apply to Compaq,

30:42.205 --> 30:43.627
you can call this number.

30:43.915 --> 30:48.512
Compaq is looking to add 500
people by the end of the year.

30:48.795 --> 30:52.049
The culture that
Rod created within Compaq

30:52.340 --> 30:54.638
was 20 years ahead of its time.

30:59.014 --> 31:03.064
Tech companies today
are very progressive, and cool,

31:03.351 --> 31:05.228
and they create a
fun environment.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.897
Where people aren't
working they're

31:07.189 --> 31:09.863
come play in our sandbox.

31:10.150 --> 31:13.495
If I work at Facebook,
they'll do my laundry,

31:13.779 --> 31:16.373
they'll pick me up and drop
me off, there's a misuse,

31:16.656 --> 31:19.956
and there's a full time chef
who is trained on cordon bleu.

31:20.243 --> 31:22.203
They basically have built
a place that is so great

31:22.412 --> 31:23.789
that you never want to leave.

31:24.081 --> 31:25.975
At a time when other computer
makers are being squeezed,

31:25.999 --> 31:27.797
why is Compaq still growing?

31:28.085 --> 31:30.679
The answer may lie beyond
technology and marketing,

31:30.962 --> 31:33.636
in a corporate culture that
gives employees free Cokes

31:33.924 --> 31:35.642
and puts trees in the.

31:35.926 --> 31:38.475
We started out providing
coffee and soft drinks

31:38.762 --> 31:41.140
for everybody when there were
1 O people in the company.

31:41.431 --> 31:43.284
Jim Harris and I would
stop by the grocery store

31:43.308 --> 31:46.107
and pick up some more
soft drinks for the day

31:46.394 --> 31:47.646
if we needed it.

31:47.938 --> 31:52.068
It was a very egalitarian
kind of culture,

31:52.359 --> 31:54.987
and it really owes it to Rod.

31:55.278 --> 31:56.798
You sense that the
employees appreciate

31:56.822 --> 31:59.041
the fact that you don't
have a marked parking place?

31:59.324 --> 32:01.042
How often do you
get to work early

32:01.326 --> 32:02.512
to get your job
done and you walk

32:02.536 --> 32:04.083
by an empty reserved
parking place?

32:04.371 --> 32:07.124
Just seemed to make sense that
the people who got there first

32:07.415 --> 32:08.883
deserved to park
closest to the door.

32:09.167 --> 32:10.847
You'd see Rod Canton
walking down the hall,

32:11.044 --> 32:14.548
and it was certainly more than
permissible... it was hoped...

32:14.840 --> 32:16.275
That you would stop and
talk with him if you

32:16.299 --> 32:17.516
had something to talk about.

32:17.801 --> 32:19.654
The corporate
culture at Compaq computer

32:19.678 --> 32:21.271
means involving
employees in decision

32:21.555 --> 32:23.307
making at almost every level.

32:23.598 --> 32:28.104
What I think, or what I say,
can change things where you

32:28.395 --> 32:29.738
work... that makes a difference.

32:30.021 --> 32:32.041
We were all
very proud of what we did.

32:32.065 --> 32:33.863
The camaraderie,
and the teamwork,

32:34.151 --> 32:37.200
and the ability to get things
done without the red tape

32:37.487 --> 32:39.740
and without all the
hassle that comes

32:40.031 --> 32:41.271
with big company bureaucracies.

32:45.829 --> 32:47.502
IBM was the very definition

32:47.789 --> 32:50.884
of what a large American
corporation was.

32:51.168 --> 32:53.512
They don't call
it Big Blue for nothing.

32:53.795 --> 32:57.425
It's a company with more
than 387,000 employees,

32:57.716 --> 33:05.271
834,000 shareholders, and 590
million shares of common stock.

33:05.557 --> 33:07.869
When you looked at
the organization chart of IBM,

33:07.893 --> 33:09.736
it was a very
hierarchical organization.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.614
Here's the person up here
and you're down here.

33:12.898 --> 33:16.277
What came down from on top is,
you better not lose and that

33:16.568 --> 33:18.115
was just in IBM's blood.

33:18.403 --> 33:21.657
So it was a very, very
competitive environment

33:21.948 --> 33:23.495
that you had to go through.

33:23.783 --> 33:25.626
The greatest asset
the IBM Corporation

33:25.911 --> 33:27.458
has happen to be its people.

33:27.746 --> 33:31.000
If you can give an individual
a given set of objectives,

33:31.291 --> 33:32.793
measure them, and
then reward them,

33:33.084 --> 33:35.382
then almost any target
can be achieved.

33:35.670 --> 33:38.093
IBM was a
financially driven company.

33:38.381 --> 33:40.725
Make your numbers, make your
numbers, make your numbers.

33:45.555 --> 33:48.024
If you run a small
business profits can get

33:48.308 --> 33:51.232
squeezed when inventory doesn't
match up with production.

33:55.941 --> 34:00.242
What can help is a visit to an
IBM personal computer dealer.

34:00.528 --> 34:02.008
We thought a breakthrough,

34:02.280 --> 34:04.703
kind of out-of-the-box
thinking for marketing

34:04.991 --> 34:07.710
was having Charlie
Chaplin sell our products.

34:07.994 --> 34:10.088
The IBM personal computer...

34:10.371 --> 34:13.376
Not only can it help you plan
ahead, it'll balance your books

34:13.667 --> 34:15.761
and give you more
time to make dough.

34:16.043 --> 34:18.105
Charlie Chaplin
being innovative marketing?

34:18.129 --> 34:20.928
It was for IBM, but it wasn't
for the rest of the world.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.349
Why buy just a video game
from Atari or on television.

34:24.636 --> 34:27.639
Invest in the wonder computer
of the 1980's for under $300.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.533
Everyone was pitching computers.

34:29.556 --> 34:31.900
You had William
Shatner for Commodore.

34:32.185 --> 34:34.654
With the Commodore
VIC-20, the whole family

34:34.938 --> 34:36.235
can learn computing at home.

34:36.523 --> 34:38.417
My personal
favorite, King Kong Bundy,

34:38.440 --> 34:39.658
was selling computers.

34:39.943 --> 34:42.321
Bundy has never
used a computer before.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.284
He's sitting down.

34:45.949 --> 34:47.549
Wait a minute, the on
screen instructions

34:47.784 --> 34:49.956
are so simple he doesn't have
to wrestle with a manual.

34:50.245 --> 34:51.746
Compaq had John Cleese.

34:52.038 --> 34:54.085
Hello, I'm going to
tell you about Compaq's

34:54.373 --> 34:55.795
new Portable II computer.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.178
It's such a marvelous machine
that it would be quite

34:58.461 --> 35:00.141
unfair to compare it
with another computer,

35:00.338 --> 35:03.558
so we've decided to
compare it with this fish.

35:03.842 --> 35:06.641
A surrealistic
comedian from England

35:06.928 --> 35:10.057
who was more identifiable
to the geeks in the audience

35:10.348 --> 35:11.588
than to the general population.

35:11.766 --> 35:13.046
The Compaq Portable II, however,

35:13.268 --> 35:16.613
can run all IBM's most
popular software 30%

35:16.896 --> 35:18.398
faster than IBM can.

35:18.690 --> 35:20.067
Ha, ha, ha.

35:20.358 --> 35:24.909
TV ads with John Cleese were
a runaway best selling hit.

35:25.196 --> 35:27.949
Inside Compaq is
capacity equal to 30 diskettes.

35:30.118 --> 35:31.118
I need a vacation.

35:31.369 --> 35:32.916
This decision was sound.

35:33.204 --> 35:34.706
Wrong, but sound.

35:34.998 --> 35:36.517
Kind of makes
you want to cry, huh?

35:36.541 --> 35:37.793
I am crying

35:38.084 --> 35:40.132
The same year
that we did the John Cleese

35:40.420 --> 35:43.139
commercials, Apple
announced the Macintosh

35:43.423 --> 35:44.423
with its 1984 commercial.

35:46.176 --> 35:48.270
And We will bury them
with their own confusion.

35:48.553 --> 35:49.054
Ah!

35:49.346 --> 35:51.974
We shall prevail.

35:54.601 --> 35:55.828
Apple Computer officially

35:55.852 --> 35:57.274
unveiled its new Macintosh.

35:57.562 --> 35:59.439
The new Apple that
costs less than $2,500

35:59.731 --> 36:02.530
is supposed to be one of the
easiest computers to use.

36:02.817 --> 36:05.017
What the Mac has really
brought us is really affordable,

36:05.278 --> 36:06.558
high resolution
graphics and that

36:06.696 --> 36:09.415
leads us to a whole new
generation of software

36:09.699 --> 36:12.043
where pictures and text
are both important.

36:12.327 --> 36:14.455
What corporations had
to do, because so many

36:14.746 --> 36:16.840
of their creative
types wanted Apple,

36:17.123 --> 36:19.842
is they had to
have a subheading.

36:20.126 --> 36:22.504
OK, the creative types
can have their Apple,

36:22.796 --> 36:26.517
but Apple was not really
compatible with the rest

36:26.800 --> 36:27.972
of the world.

36:28.259 --> 36:30.182
And Apple really
didn't want that world.

36:30.470 --> 36:35.442
Apple was
not a concern to Compaq

36:35.725 --> 36:38.569
because they seemed perfectly
happy with their 4% or 5%

36:38.853 --> 36:42.357
market share, and
people that bought.

36:42.649 --> 36:44.743
Apples weren't usually
people that were

36:45.026 --> 36:46.146
going to buy Compaqs anyway.

36:46.403 --> 36:48.622
Meet the lady.

36:48.905 --> 36:52.375
Her name is Lisa, and she
is the most exciting thing

36:52.659 --> 36:54.878
to happen in computers today.

36:55.161 --> 36:57.038
Steve Jobs created the Lisa,

36:57.330 --> 37:01.085
an attempt to do what Compaq
ultimately did successfully.

37:01.376 --> 37:04.471
It was an attempt to enter the
business market for computers

37:04.754 --> 37:05.926
and it failed miserably.

37:06.214 --> 37:09.718
Unlimited
power... Lisa, from Apple.

37:10.009 --> 37:13.138
Despite
Steve Jobs welcoming Compaq

37:13.430 --> 37:15.683
to this industry, that they
had thought that they had

37:15.974 --> 37:18.602
pioneered, Steve Jobs
was gone from his company

37:18.893 --> 37:21.146
within the space of three years.

37:21.438 --> 37:26.160
Compaq basically shook Silicon
Valley to its very foundations.

37:26.443 --> 37:29.037
What Compaq did give to Apple

37:29.320 --> 37:30.947
was that it proved
that you could

37:31.239 --> 37:35.415
compete against the
monster and succeed.

37:35.702 --> 37:37.142
Well, computer
stocks haven't exactly

37:37.245 --> 37:38.997
been the darlings of
Wall Street of late,

37:39.289 --> 37:40.916
but as Steve Young
now reports, that

37:41.207 --> 37:43.505
didn't stop Compaq from
promoting its latest

37:43.793 --> 37:44.885
product in gala fashion.

37:46.504 --> 37:48.064
I wear my sunglasses at night.

37:48.173 --> 37:49.766
I wear my sunglasses at night.

37:50.049 --> 37:52.049
Ladies and
gentlemen, David Copperfield.

37:59.142 --> 38:00.689
Ken Price basically

38:00.977 --> 38:05.323
came up with the concept of an
event to introduce a product.

38:05.607 --> 38:07.780
There were no limits.

38:08.067 --> 38:10.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
Compaq Computer Corporation

38:11.237 --> 38:15.617
proudly presents, live,
The Pointer Sisters.

38:15.909 --> 38:20.130
I'm so excited,
and I just can't hide it.

38:20.413 --> 38:22.099
I went to
some of those early Compaq

38:22.123 --> 38:24.091
product introductions,
and I'm going,

38:24.375 --> 38:27.879
wow, that's like show biz.

38:28.171 --> 38:30.316
I was doing things
that I had never done before.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.809
Ladies and
gentlemen, Rod Canton.

38:33.092 --> 38:35.561
Rod Baby Canton as we say
in Hollywood, Rod Baby.

38:35.845 --> 38:39.941
All tech CEOs
need communications training.

38:40.225 --> 38:43.274
He went from Walt-Mart
polyester suits and shirts

38:43.561 --> 38:47.361
to really nice woolen
designer jackets.

38:47.649 --> 38:50.277
All of us could use
a little improvement, right.

38:50.568 --> 38:52.570
He got some dental work done.

38:52.862 --> 38:54.342
He went to speech school.

38:54.531 --> 38:56.659
I never dreamed that
it could come this far.

38:56.950 --> 38:58.702
We went out and got contacts.

38:58.993 --> 39:01.212
Rod was more than receptive.

39:01.496 --> 39:03.432
We knew a lot
about designing products

39:03.456 --> 39:05.584
and knew nothing
about the press,

39:05.875 --> 39:07.843
and Ben took me under
his wing and was a very

39:08.127 --> 39:10.129
important influence on me.

39:10.421 --> 39:14.176
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Irene Cara.

39:14.467 --> 39:15.467
What a feeling.

39:18.137 --> 39:20.765
Even believing.

39:21.057 --> 39:22.618
Today, we
would like to introduce

39:22.642 --> 39:25.942
a major addition to the Compaq
family, the Compaq Plus.

39:26.229 --> 39:29.028
Compaq Plus stores
30 times more than yours.

39:29.315 --> 39:30.032
Does it have a handle?

39:30.316 --> 39:31.943
ANNOUNCERI Yes.

39:32.235 --> 39:33.235
Oh, drat.

39:33.444 --> 39:34.804
Introducing the
Compaq Portable II.

39:36.614 --> 39:39.037
Compaq's sales
jumped 54% for the first three

39:39.325 --> 39:40.417
months of the year.

39:40.702 --> 39:42.096
Apparently, I should
never have mentioned.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.838
Compaq's portable computer.

39:44.122 --> 39:46.202
I should have been telling
you about Compaq's DeskPro

39:46.291 --> 39:47.417
computer.

39:47.709 --> 39:48.727
Today, we're
announcing the DeskPro

39:48.751 --> 39:54.099
286, and the Portable 286.

39:54.382 --> 39:56.180
Congratulations for
another terrific year,

39:56.467 --> 39:58.140
people of Compaq Computers.

40:04.142 --> 40:05.485
We got to enjoy the day and then

40:05.768 --> 40:07.987
we'll get back to work well,
maybe tomorrow, I guess.

40:11.274 --> 40:13.276
Jan, this is what
the fuss is all about.

40:13.568 --> 40:16.196
The 8386 microprocessor
from Intel.

40:16.487 --> 40:19.286
Now, no real operating system,
no real software, yet people

40:19.574 --> 40:22.373
are waiting in line to buy
computers with 386 in it.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.941
More talk about it than probably
anything since the IBM PC

40:25.204 --> 40:26.626
came OUT.

40:26.914 --> 40:28.434
Is this a lot of hype, or is
this really a major development

40:28.458 --> 40:29.458
of personal computers?

40:29.667 --> 40:31.027
Oh, this is not
just hype, Stewart,

40:31.169 --> 40:33.422
this is a quantum leap
in personal computers.

40:33.713 --> 40:35.193
Right now, people
are standing in line

40:35.465 --> 40:37.785
to get these systems just for
the raw speed that it offers.

40:38.051 --> 40:40.145
The 386 chips, which give PCs

40:40.428 --> 40:43.932
the power and stunning clarity
of so-called workstations,

40:44.223 --> 40:46.726
are expected to become
commonplace in a year or two.

40:47.018 --> 40:51.068
IBM always had first access
to the Intel computer chip,

40:51.356 --> 40:52.699
so everybody else was followers.

40:52.982 --> 40:56.407
So IBM was always at the tip
of the spear so to speak.

40:56.694 --> 41:03.748
IBM for maybe 70 years, I don't
know... however long it existed,

41:04.035 --> 41:06.083
expected exclusives.

41:11.668 --> 41:13.295
Intel took the attitude,

41:13.586 --> 41:15.179
we're not going to
work with just you,

41:15.463 --> 41:17.966
we're working with everybody.

41:23.096 --> 41:27.977
The significance of them
being willing to release

41:28.267 --> 41:30.861
a microprocessor to
someone who wasn't IBM,

41:31.145 --> 41:35.366
was at a minimum, a modestly
hostile act towards IBM.

41:35.650 --> 41:37.323
Compaq Computer
will announce two

41:37.610 --> 41:39.612
new personal computers
today, including

41:39.904 --> 41:41.372
the world's fastest model.

41:41.656 --> 41:44.751
A development that could make
Big Blue, IBM, green with envy.

41:45.034 --> 41:47.537
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

41:47.829 --> 41:50.548
come on, come on, come on.

41:50.832 --> 41:53.176
Today, Compaq
Computer Corporation

41:53.459 --> 41:56.258
is stepping to the forefront of
the personal computer industry.

41:56.546 --> 42:00.972
The Compaq DeskPro 386 is
by far the most advanced

42:01.259 --> 42:03.404
high performance personal
computer available in the world

42:03.428 --> 42:03.929
today.

42:04.220 --> 42:06.769
The 386 era is here.

42:07.056 --> 42:10.105
Everyone at Intel is very
enthused about Compaq's

42:10.393 --> 42:11.440
announcement today.

42:11.728 --> 42:13.205
The system has a maximum RAM

42:13.229 --> 42:15.323
capacity of 14 megabytes.

42:15.606 --> 42:17.199
This provides more
than enough memory

42:17.483 --> 42:19.406
for not only today's
applications,

42:19.694 --> 42:21.116
but for tomorrow's as well.

42:21.404 --> 42:23.084
Of course, Compaq was
first out of the gate

42:23.364 --> 42:27.164
with a 386 computer, but this
time IBM is not in the picture.

42:27.452 --> 42:30.205
We spent a lot
of time trying to prove,

42:30.496 --> 42:32.169
absolutely beyond a
shadow of a doubt,

42:32.457 --> 42:33.737
that this thing
was going to work

42:33.833 --> 42:35.631
and it was going to
succeed, so how better

42:35.918 --> 42:37.438
than having Bill
Gates himself standing

42:37.712 --> 42:38.964
up and saying how great it was.

42:39.255 --> 42:41.678
The original vision of
Microsoft-that there would

42:41.966 --> 42:45.391
eventually be a machine on
most desktops for office work,

42:45.678 --> 42:48.397
will be fulfilled by the
power of this type of machine.

42:48.681 --> 42:53.562
It's gutsy, and the
industry was like, whoa.

42:53.853 --> 42:56.823
I'm sure IBM went, they what?

42:57.106 --> 42:58.449
We did not see it coming.

42:58.733 --> 43:01.987
They couldn't have been happy.

43:02.278 --> 43:05.248
And we couldn't
have been happier.

43:05.531 --> 43:08.626
Compaq insists that I tell you
about their new 386 computer,

43:08.910 --> 43:11.083
which they say is the most
advanced desktop ever made.

43:11.370 --> 43:13.748
But they're still sticking
to this cock and bull story

43:14.040 --> 43:19.718
<i>about it being made from 386
chips and 32 bits of a bus.</i>

43:20.004 --> 43:21.881
Frankly, this is not credible.

43:22.173 --> 43:23.573
It's an insult to
your intelligence.

43:23.841 --> 43:26.094
If I were you, I wouldn't
watch this commercial.

43:26.385 --> 43:28.137
In fact, I'll
switch over for you.

43:28.429 --> 43:33.356
That was the first time that
we came out so far ahead of them

43:33.643 --> 43:36.738
that people started asking
what happened to IBM.

43:37.021 --> 43:40.070
I mean, you just follow
what IBM does, right?

43:40.358 --> 43:42.326
That was the
beginning of somebody

43:42.610 --> 43:47.286
putting real chips behind IBM is
vulnerable and Intel did that.

43:47.573 --> 43:50.326
The funny thing is that certain
other companies are still

43:50.618 --> 43:51.738
trying to make one of these.

43:51.786 --> 43:54.414
So if you work for
mm, mm, mm, ha!

43:54.705 --> 43:59.677
<i>Remember, all you need are 386
chips and 32 bits of a bus.</i>

43:59.961 --> 44:02.840
We still dominated
the corporate computing

44:03.130 --> 44:06.930
marketplace, and if they got
too big, then We would move in.

44:07.218 --> 44:10.142
Is it fair to characterize
you, as a competitor of IBM,

44:10.429 --> 44:12.682
do you really take
them on, head on?

44:12.974 --> 44:15.443
Well, we certainly
compete directly with IBM.

44:15.726 --> 44:18.354
Our intent is not so
much to compete with IBM,

44:18.646 --> 44:21.991
as to compete for customers
who have an alternative

44:22.275 --> 44:23.322
of buying IBM products.

44:23.609 --> 44:25.156
It has been a star performer.

44:25.444 --> 44:28.948
It has grown faster than almost
any other company in history

44:29.240 --> 44:31.789
in so short a period of
time, but this business

44:32.076 --> 44:32.577
is fraught with.

44:32.869 --> 44:33.961
Danger.

44:34.245 --> 44:36.668
Do you think they can
continue this pace?

44:36.956 --> 44:37.956
It's doubtful.

44:41.419 --> 44:44.298
Compaq released
sales predictions Wednesday

44:44.589 --> 44:46.683
saying the company will
report first quarter sales

44:46.966 --> 44:48.809
of more than $200 million.

44:49.093 --> 44:50.737
The company's
two latest machines,

44:50.761 --> 44:54.140
a desktop and a portable,
are pound for pound the most

44:54.432 --> 44:56.025
powerful computers ever made.

44:56.309 --> 44:58.509
Compaq more than
doubled it's sales last year

44:58.686 --> 45:00.154
and almost tripled its earnings.

45:00.438 --> 45:02.907
It took Compaq Computer
just three years

45:03.190 --> 45:06.490
to leap into the Fortune
500 list of the nation's

45:06.777 --> 45:08.324
largest industrial companies.

45:08.613 --> 45:11.412
The press enjoyed
writing about the wild Texans

45:11.699 --> 45:14.919
that came from nowhere
and made a stake

45:15.202 --> 45:16.454
in the high tech industry.

45:16.746 --> 45:18.015
The Northwest Eastern storm

45:18.039 --> 45:19.541
is being discussed
around the country

45:19.832 --> 45:22.019
as one of the fastest growing
companies in recent history.

45:22.043 --> 45:23.923
We were having
the time of our life.

45:28.382 --> 45:29.622
We never stopped.

45:29.717 --> 45:31.435
We worked hard, we played hard.

45:31.719 --> 45:33.599
Compaq plans
to announce what amounts

45:33.679 --> 45:35.147
to the Lamborghini of PCs.

45:35.431 --> 45:36.774
As time went on you

45:37.058 --> 45:39.402
see neater and cooler cars
show up in the parking lot.

45:39.685 --> 45:44.282
I bought a 1982 Porsche 928.

45:44.565 --> 45:46.251
He showed up
at my house one morning,

45:46.275 --> 45:48.528
about 10 o'clock with a pitcher
of Bloody Mary's, and he

45:48.819 --> 45:51.072
said, c'mon, let's
go buy a couple cars.

45:51.364 --> 45:52.758
I had my wife, my kids,

45:52.782 --> 45:54.580
and we went to the
Corvette dealer to get me

45:54.867 --> 45:56.335
a red and white
Corvette convertible.

45:56.619 --> 45:59.919
I drove a four cylinder Tempest
with a cracked windshield,

46:00.206 --> 46:04.677
so that was more or less
the kind of cars that were

46:04.961 --> 46:06.258
in the parking lot before then.

46:13.427 --> 46:17.773
Those of us who
were used to eating McDonald's

46:18.057 --> 46:19.775
and drinking
Budweiser beer, were

46:20.059 --> 46:22.778
suddenly eating smoked salmon
and drinking Don Perignon.

46:23.062 --> 46:24.665
I was looking
out the window one day

46:24.689 --> 46:27.238
and a helicopter landed.

46:27.525 --> 46:30.119
And this girl I worked
with left the building,

46:30.403 --> 46:32.246
walked, out got
in the helicopter,

46:32.530 --> 46:33.840
and then a little
while later came back.

46:33.864 --> 46:34.925
And I said, what were you doing?

46:34.949 --> 46:36.246
She said, went to lunch.

46:36.534 --> 46:38.512
Every once in a while We
slow down enough to step back

46:38.536 --> 46:43.337
and look at it, and it's
been tremendously rewarding,

46:43.624 --> 46:45.144
and it does seem like
a dream at times.

46:45.376 --> 46:47.219
Sales at the
halfway stage this year

46:47.503 --> 46:49.346
were just under half
a billion dollars.

46:49.630 --> 46:51.110
Only one company in history

46:51.298 --> 46:54.177
has exceeded $1 billion in
sales in his first five years.

46:54.468 --> 46:56.516
It happened just last
year, and the company was.

46:56.804 --> 46:58.602
Compaq Computer Corporation.

46:58.889 --> 47:01.984
One Wall Street analyst says
sales could tap a billion

47:02.268 --> 47:04.612
and a half dollars next year.

47:04.895 --> 47:07.193
Holy shit, what the hell's
going on here, right?

47:07.481 --> 47:10.030
I mean, I go and ask the people
who've been the investment

47:10.317 --> 47:11.503
business a long
time, have you ever

47:11.527 --> 47:13.074
seen anything like this before?

47:13.362 --> 47:14.362
And of course nobody had.

47:21.495 --> 47:23.623
My name's
Rod and I'm proud of us.

47:23.914 --> 47:25.882
Setting records
fast and furious.

47:26.167 --> 47:27.686
Put some cable here, a shock

47:27.710 --> 47:30.429
mount there, put it in a
box that ain't quite square.

47:30.713 --> 47:33.341
We are Compaq's computer
crew, shufflin' on down,

47:33.632 --> 47:34.632
doing it for you.

47:34.884 --> 47:36.761
We're so phat, we
know we're good.

47:37.053 --> 47:39.431
Selling the
like We knew We would.

47:46.270 --> 47:54.270
The success of
the company was tremendous,

47:55.529 --> 47:59.204
but on a personal level
there were some, I'd say,

47:59.492 --> 48:02.120
difficulties.

48:02.411 --> 48:05.290
There was a definitive gap

48:05.581 --> 48:10.337
between yourself, your
spouse, sometimes your family,

48:10.628 --> 48:12.551
which caused a lot of problems.

48:12.838 --> 48:17.309
A lot of challenges and
a lot of ill feeling.

48:19.804 --> 48:21.114
Now there were certainly

48:21.138 --> 48:22.685
some things I did
miss, but I worked

48:22.973 --> 48:27.149
as hard as I could to do both.

48:27.436 --> 48:34.115
Coaching Little League and
spending time at school.

48:34.401 --> 48:37.280
I think it's always sad
when families split up.

48:40.574 --> 48:44.750
There's nothing I can do about
anybody else's, in my own case

48:45.037 --> 48:46.917
there were a lot of factors
that lead to a point

48:47.123 --> 48:52.505
where ended up
getting a divorce.

48:52.795 --> 48:54.564
And I remember
coming home one day,

48:54.588 --> 48:59.845
and my wife said,
Chris, who's my son,

49:00.136 --> 49:05.814
mistook the gentleman working
on the ice machine as you.

49:06.100 --> 49:08.774
Wait, OK, that's a problem.

49:09.061 --> 49:10.062
This isn't working.

49:13.315 --> 49:19.322
And he said, I want to retire.

49:19.613 --> 49:22.457
And that was a shock.

49:22.741 --> 49:25.711
It's always been
am I enjoying what I'm doing?

49:25.995 --> 49:28.214
And the moment I'm
not, change it.

49:32.001 --> 49:34.345
This is what
happens to all big companies.

49:34.628 --> 49:36.380
There are none, I
don't believe, that

49:36.672 --> 49:40.643
ever can keep what they
had in the beginning

49:40.926 --> 49:42.644
throughout their growth.

49:42.928 --> 49:43.928
It's impossible.

49:49.435 --> 49:56.364
That happened during
one of the toughest times...

49:56.650 --> 50:00.200
Toughest periods of my
leadership of the company.

50:00.487 --> 50:02.285
While many of the IBM
compatible companies

50:02.573 --> 50:05.042
have already gone
under, literally, Compaq

50:05.326 --> 50:06.669
has yet to really falter.

50:06.952 --> 50:09.626
Compaq Computer has
tried to outsmart IBM.

50:09.914 --> 50:11.757
First, Compaq
took on the big boys,

50:12.041 --> 50:15.295
then became one of them,
and now must fight to stay.

50:31.727 --> 50:34.071
I knew what IBM was capable of,

50:34.355 --> 50:36.824
and I knew that they would
come sooner or later.

50:37.107 --> 50:38.867
I can't help but be
reminded about that joke,

50:38.984 --> 50:40.304
how do you dance
with an elephant?

50:40.402 --> 50:42.154
Very carefully, right, exactly.

50:42.446 --> 50:44.949
There was these
industry rumors that IBM

50:45.241 --> 50:46.367
was going to sue Compaq.

50:49.453 --> 50:51.000
Let me just say Compaq

50:51.288 --> 50:54.508
was practicing a large number
of IBM's patents, large number.

50:57.503 --> 50:59.731
They were beginning
to sense that they weren't

50:59.755 --> 51:01.435
going to be able to
control the PC industry

51:01.548 --> 51:03.425
and make the kind of
profits they were used to,

51:03.717 --> 51:07.472
so they were looking to make
money off of their patents.

51:07.763 --> 51:11.108
Bob Jackson showed
up at our door

51:11.392 --> 51:15.147
and asked to see the
CEO of the company.

51:15.437 --> 51:18.111
IBM is here.

51:18.399 --> 51:21.403
When IBM came they
brought an army of people.

51:21.694 --> 51:23.241
I don't really
know who they Were.

51:23.529 --> 51:25.452
IBM would do this thing called

51:25.739 --> 51:28.083
filling the skies with lawyers.

51:28.367 --> 51:31.712
I got very
concerned, very concerned.

51:31.996 --> 51:33.498
Holy Shit.

51:33.789 --> 51:36.070
The idea was
that lawyers would descend on

51:36.166 --> 51:40.091
you in such a huge number it
felt like the airborne was

51:40.379 --> 51:41.847
parachuting into your office.

51:42.131 --> 51:43.553
These guys could shut us down.

51:43.841 --> 51:47.345
I mean, if they really
want to go to the mat

51:47.636 --> 51:50.856
that's a distinct possibility.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.859
I said, IBM has 9,000 patents.

51:54.143 --> 51:57.147
OK, maybe half of them
don't apply to you,

51:57.438 --> 51:59.406
but we've shown you 20.

51:59.690 --> 52:03.991
There are hundreds more, and
you can invalidate some of them,

52:04.278 --> 52:07.623
but you can't
invalidate them all.

52:07.906 --> 52:09.968
They wanted a
percentage of our sales price

52:09.992 --> 52:13.462
for all of our sales.

52:13.746 --> 52:14.889
They were at $2 billion,

52:14.913 --> 52:17.291
and we were at $2 million.

52:17.583 --> 52:22.680
It could end a company,
stop a company in its tracks.

52:22.963 --> 52:25.716
If they
misbehaved... loosely used term,

52:26.008 --> 52:30.138
but if they misbehaved we
had the howitzers lined up.

52:30.429 --> 52:33.353
I went in to Rod
and told him we had to get

52:33.640 --> 52:34.983
serious about the negotiations.

52:35.267 --> 52:40.740
They weren't going to settle
for a few million dollars.

52:41.023 --> 52:43.143
He was very
serious that if we didn't take

52:43.275 --> 52:46.745
this offer, then they were
going to come after us,

52:47.029 --> 52:49.703
and they weren't
going to back off.

52:49.990 --> 52:54.370
We went up to about $130
million and that closed it.

53:04.505 --> 53:06.149
The sword hanging over our head,

53:06.173 --> 53:09.177
which was what's IBM going
to do to shut you down,

53:09.468 --> 53:14.725
seemed like it had left
until April the second.

53:15.015 --> 53:16.938
Hey, everybody, the
new computers are here.

53:17.226 --> 53:18.226
New computers?

53:18.477 --> 53:20.571
Who may I ask authorized
new computers?

53:20.854 --> 53:21.525
Yeah, who?

53:21.814 --> 53:22.315
You did.

53:22.606 --> 53:23.107
Who did?

53:23.399 --> 53:24.400
I did?

53:24.691 --> 53:26.785
IBM... of course I did.

53:27.069 --> 53:29.993
The new IBM Personal System
II, the next generation

53:30.280 --> 53:31.577
of personal computing.

53:31.865 --> 53:33.635
It was the biggest
IBM product announcement

53:33.659 --> 53:35.411
since the original PC.

53:35.702 --> 53:38.080
IBM'S Personal
System II computer

53:38.372 --> 53:40.625
with the so-called
microchannel, an entirely

53:40.916 --> 53:42.668
new computer system
that offers lots

53:42.960 --> 53:44.462
of extra speed and capacity.

53:44.753 --> 53:46.972
We built an excellent product.

53:47.256 --> 53:48.974
The micro channel is,
by technical specs,

53:49.258 --> 53:50.601
superior to the alternative.

53:50.884 --> 53:52.284
Permitting computer users

53:52.344 --> 53:55.018
to perform several
functions at the same time,

53:55.305 --> 53:56.773
like writing and printing.

53:57.057 --> 53:59.577
Functions that on many computers
can only be done in succession.

53:59.643 --> 54:01.763
Another new feature is that
it has a port where we can

54:02.020 --> 54:04.148
plug this mouse,
this pointing device,

54:04.440 --> 54:06.534
directly into the system.

54:06.817 --> 54:10.617
My first reaction when I saw
the announcement of the PSII,

54:10.904 --> 54:12.372
was oh, shit.

54:12.656 --> 54:16.001
IBM is introducing a
new line of personal computers

54:16.285 --> 54:18.583
that will be compatible
with its own software

54:18.871 --> 54:21.750
but difficult for
competitors to duplicate.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.917
Microchannel was their way

54:24.209 --> 54:27.804
of breaking the whole
compatibility thing

54:28.088 --> 54:29.886
and putting it
behind them forever.

54:30.174 --> 54:32.097
IBM, it's just,
it's nobody else.

54:32.384 --> 54:35.012
This is our operating system,
it only runs on this machine.

54:35.304 --> 54:37.282
You can't have it, you can't
have it, you can't have it.

54:37.306 --> 54:39.650
You have to buy this
machine in order to run

54:39.933 --> 54:41.435
our software, end of story.

54:41.727 --> 54:42.954
There was no doubt
they were just

54:42.978 --> 54:45.106
absolutely trying
to kill everybody

54:45.397 --> 54:46.523
else... kill all the clones.

54:46.815 --> 54:48.943
IBM has come out, and in
response to the market,

54:49.234 --> 54:50.611
is lean and mean.

54:50.903 --> 54:54.032
It's the next revolution and
evolution of microcomputers,

54:54.323 --> 54:56.246
and logically enough,
it comes from, still,

54:56.533 --> 54:57.534
the market leader in PCs.

54:57.826 --> 54:59.544
United was the
first corporate buyer

54:59.828 --> 55:01.830
<i>of the Personal System
II computers with</i>

55:02.122 --> 55:04.420
an order for 40,000 Model 50's.

55:04.708 --> 55:07.928
It was the Death
Star of our era.

55:08.212 --> 55:09.805
Something designed
to destroy all

55:10.088 --> 55:11.510
the competition on the planet.

55:11.798 --> 55:14.642
IBM has developed in the shape
that will set the standard

55:14.927 --> 55:16.362
for the next five
years that the others

55:16.386 --> 55:19.356
will have to play against.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.610
We had our
first PSII inside Compaq

55:22.893 --> 55:25.772
within three hours
of the announcement

55:26.063 --> 55:27.690
and started tearing
those suckers apart.

55:33.987 --> 55:36.035
We were very confused
about this microchannel.

55:39.076 --> 55:41.170
The drawback is
that, for the most part,

55:41.453 --> 55:43.171
the new microchannel
system is not

55:43.455 --> 55:45.423
compatible with
the existing system

55:45.707 --> 55:49.086
most personal computer companies
now use that IBM developed.

55:49.378 --> 55:51.523
It was faster than
the computer it replaced,

55:51.547 --> 55:54.847
but it made useless $12
billion worth of software

55:55.133 --> 55:56.680
already bought by business.

55:56.969 --> 55:58.186
Will it hurt the consumer?

55:58.470 --> 56:00.393
Well, it is a problem for
a company who has a lot

56:00.681 --> 56:02.604
of existing PCs installed.

56:02.891 --> 56:04.160
Like Metropolitan Life.

56:04.184 --> 56:05.704
Insurance Company,
where they have more

56:05.811 --> 56:07.859
than 8,000 personal computers.

56:08.146 --> 56:11.400
More than half of them IBM, but
while Metropolitan continues

56:11.692 --> 56:16.038
to buy PCs, none of them has the
new IBM microchannel standard.

56:16.321 --> 56:17.761
The cat's out of the bag.

56:17.948 --> 56:20.576
The customers now realize
you can buy something that's

56:20.867 --> 56:23.541
not IBM, and not get fired.

56:23.829 --> 56:26.753
And in fact, it works
better sometimes.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.509
The ground underneath us
is starting to come apart,

56:29.793 --> 56:31.420
but we're making that
last ditch effort.

56:31.712 --> 56:34.112
It's kind of like the two minute
drive at the end of the game

56:34.381 --> 56:39.603
to try to get this back under
control, but it's not working.

56:39.886 --> 56:42.639
The PSII was the
biggest mistake they made.

56:42.931 --> 56:44.826
They handed
us the keys to the PC city

56:44.850 --> 56:46.818
and we took them.

56:47.102 --> 56:48.862
Now, the
question is, did IBM make

56:48.979 --> 56:50.606
a mistake that's irreversible?

56:50.897 --> 56:52.899
One that may lead
to even more erosion

56:53.191 --> 56:54.951
in its share of the
personal computer market.

56:55.235 --> 56:58.330
IBM just screwed
all new customers.

56:58.614 --> 57:00.366
They walked away
from compatibility,

57:00.657 --> 57:02.580
and you're going
to pay the price.

57:02.868 --> 57:08.466
If we could take that
message and isolate IBM,

57:08.749 --> 57:10.672
then it became a much
stronger message.

57:10.959 --> 57:12.719
There is a revolt of
the clones this morning.

57:12.878 --> 57:14.278
The nine personal
computer companies

57:14.463 --> 57:16.761
whose business has always
followed IBM's design lead.

57:17.049 --> 57:19.598
It's a case of IBM versus the
rest of the personal computer

57:19.885 --> 57:21.262
industry.

57:21.553 --> 57:23.323
Let's call them
the gang of nine, a who's who

57:23.347 --> 57:25.645
of heavyweights in
the computer industry.

57:25.932 --> 57:28.435
Gunning for the increasingly
disputed champion, IBM.

57:28.727 --> 57:31.196
The little guys got together
and said, that's enough.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.984
The first one we
went to was Microsoft.

57:35.275 --> 57:38.950
Bill thought it was a great
idea, but he also feared IBM.

57:39.237 --> 57:41.410
IBM was
still his largest customer,

57:41.698 --> 57:44.827
and he just invested a
whole bunch with IBM.

57:45.118 --> 57:49.339
Microsoft knows
it has a market with IBM,

57:49.623 --> 57:53.218
but they recognized,
relatively early on,

57:53.502 --> 57:56.221
that all of their capabilities
were going to be providing

57:56.505 --> 57:57.757
to the largest number of users.

57:58.048 --> 57:59.525
He was
looking for opportunities.

57:59.549 --> 58:01.392
He would have jumped
at any opportunity

58:01.677 --> 58:03.520
to do something
for Microsoft that

58:03.804 --> 58:05.147
would build their business.

58:05.430 --> 58:08.058
If I was Bill Gates, I would
see the compatible market

58:08.350 --> 58:10.023
as the reason why
I am eventually

58:10.310 --> 58:12.984
going to be a multi-billionaire,
and one of the most successful

58:13.271 --> 58:14.739
people on the planet.

58:15.023 --> 58:17.168
The way you were
supposed to deal with IBM was

58:17.192 --> 58:20.196
that a smile and a
hand shake in one hand,

58:20.487 --> 58:22.727
and a knife to stab them in
the back with the other hand.

58:22.906 --> 58:24.624
Bill said, yep, I'll contact

58:24.908 --> 58:27.206
all the other
manufacturers and give

58:27.494 --> 58:30.213
you a inroad to their CEOs.

58:30.497 --> 58:32.215
Compaq, Tandy, Hewlett-Packard,

58:32.499 --> 58:34.342
Olivetti, and NEC.

58:34.626 --> 58:36.048
It reads like a who's who

58:36.336 --> 58:39.055
of the high tech world with
the notable exception of IBM.

58:39.339 --> 58:41.888
Now it's not only
compact, but you've

58:42.175 --> 58:46.271
got a whole group of people
that they've got with them, too.

58:46.555 --> 58:48.978
You're thinking,
wow, maybe this thing

58:49.266 --> 58:50.688
is bigger than We thought.

58:50.976 --> 58:52.495
Can you get all the little guys

58:52.519 --> 58:55.398
together and beat Goliath?

58:55.689 --> 58:59.068
That wasn't like a sure thing,
it was not a sure thing.

58:59.359 --> 59:04.286
Rod got a call from Lowe the
day before we announced it.

59:04.573 --> 59:06.509
There was no way
I wasn't going to go forward,

59:06.533 --> 59:08.386
and there wasn't any Way
I was going to indicate

59:08.410 --> 59:09.707
any weakness to him.

59:09.995 --> 59:11.588
And he said, I
think you're making

59:11.872 --> 59:14.250
a big mistake by doing this.

59:14.541 --> 59:16.384
I said, well, we'll see.

59:16.668 --> 59:18.841
Led by Compaq
Computer, IBM rivals

59:19.129 --> 59:20.881
will unveil the new
machines at a major news

59:21.173 --> 59:22.470
conference in New York.

59:22.758 --> 59:24.402
They decided to
develop their own computer

59:24.426 --> 59:27.521
standards, called extended
industry standard architecture.

59:27.804 --> 59:29.181
Or EISA for short.

59:29.473 --> 59:30.908
Challenging the very standard

59:30.932 --> 59:33.151
IBM is pushing with
its highly touted.

59:33.435 --> 59:34.982
Personal System Il computers.

59:35.270 --> 59:38.319
They're not afraid of IBM.

59:38.607 --> 59:43.613
They are taking on IBM, and the
tide is starting to turn now.

59:43.904 --> 59:47.283
And the microchannel
has a real threat to it.

59:47.574 --> 59:49.594
All of the companies
that gathered at the industry

59:49.618 --> 59:53.418
forum endorsed EISA because
it maintains capability

59:53.705 --> 59:55.878
with the almost 20
million computers

59:56.166 --> 59:57.588
that exist in the world today.

59:57.876 --> 01:00:00.220
Therefore, it protects the
investment of today's millions

01:00:00.504 --> 01:00:01.926
of PC users worldwide.

01:00:02.214 --> 01:00:04.192
While offering
just as much speed and memory

01:00:04.216 --> 01:00:07.595
as microchannel, and armed
with a host of heavy support.

01:00:07.886 --> 01:00:10.139
It is important that
we provide system

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:15.436
software products which fully
support EISA based machines.

01:00:15.727 --> 01:00:21.279
This event exemplifies the
industry's determination

01:00:21.566 --> 01:00:23.944
to create and to
expand standards.

01:00:24.236 --> 01:00:30.289
The industry together stood
up against IBM and prevailed.

01:00:30.575 --> 01:00:32.512
Letting the world
know that Big Blue isn't

01:00:32.536 --> 01:00:34.209
calling the shots anymore.

01:00:34.496 --> 01:00:37.045
Their ability to change
the market in directions

01:00:37.332 --> 01:00:39.300
that don't make
to a lot of people

01:00:39.584 --> 01:00:41.302
is just simply
not there anymore.

01:00:41.586 --> 01:00:43.867
Some analysts think
it was a day that left Big.

01:00:44.005 --> 01:00:46.133
Blue looking black and blue.

01:00:46.424 --> 01:00:48.643
The genius
of Intel and Microsoft

01:00:48.927 --> 01:00:52.932
was that they both decided
to take a chance on Compaq.

01:00:53.223 --> 01:00:55.317
Because essentially,
Compaq became

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.353
the canary in the coal
mine for the strategy

01:00:58.645 --> 01:01:00.568
of divorcing from IBM.

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:05.282
And their willingness
to place their future

01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:07.663
in the hands of this
group from Houston

01:01:07.946 --> 01:01:11.621
was pretty brave, and in
retrospect, brilliant.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.808
One final question, and
kind of a personal one,

01:01:29.092 --> 01:01:31.595
are there some mountains out
there still for Rod Canton

01:01:31.887 --> 01:01:33.230
to climb?

01:01:33.513 --> 01:01:36.141
I think my biggest challenge
for the foreseeable future

01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:38.561
is to keep Compaq together.

01:01:38.852 --> 01:01:41.776
Keep the culture,
keep it rolling,

01:01:42.063 --> 01:01:43.531
and reach whatever
potential's there.

01:01:43.815 --> 01:01:46.659
Nobody really knows how fast and
how far a computer company can

01:01:46.943 --> 01:01:48.103
go, and I'd like to see that.

01:01:48.361 --> 01:01:50.363
Compaq Computer is one
of the fastest growing

01:01:50.655 --> 01:01:52.077
personal computer makers.

01:01:52.365 --> 01:01:54.868
There's a company whose sales
have grown from $111 million

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.664
in 1983 to more than
$2 billion last year.

01:01:58.955 --> 01:02:00.127
So what's to worry about?

01:02:00.415 --> 01:02:03.635
It was a very different company.

01:02:03.919 --> 01:02:05.887
How do you manage 17,000
people in the same way

01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:07.815
that you manage a hundred...
It's not possible.

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:11.594
Every time you
hire you end up, potentially,

01:02:11.885 --> 01:02:14.434
starting to dilute,
and then over time you

01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:17.144
end up with an
organization that isn't

01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:19.400
the same as the organization
you started with.

01:02:19.684 --> 01:02:21.324
Has the fun gone out
of it now that you've

01:02:21.436 --> 01:02:22.636
built this successful company?

01:02:22.812 --> 01:02:23.313
Will you stay with it?

01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:24.652
What are your plans?

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.692
Oh, no, the fun is still there.

01:02:26.983 --> 01:02:30.533
The challenge is different,
that's all I can say.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.580
There's nothing quite
like starting a company

01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:34.366
and having it grow rapidly.

01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:37.502
As we moved to a
Fortune 500 status

01:02:37.786 --> 01:02:39.709
and then approaching the
billion dollar level,

01:02:39.996 --> 01:02:42.465
the problems are different.

01:02:42.749 --> 01:02:44.296
We knew we needed a leader

01:02:44.584 --> 01:02:49.306
to build a team in Europe,
and through a recommendation,

01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:51.683
we contacted Eckhard
Pfeiffer and very

01:02:51.967 --> 01:02:53.402
quickly he joined
the company and began

01:02:53.426 --> 01:02:54.643
to build our European team.

01:02:54.928 --> 01:02:57.681
We decided that we would
go into the major markets

01:02:57.973 --> 01:03:02.069
right from the start, which were
Germany, the UK, and France.

01:03:02.352 --> 01:03:03.774
And from then on
expand gradually

01:03:04.062 --> 01:03:05.860
into all the other countries.

01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:11.244
He was more accustomed to
high volume manufacturing,

01:03:11.528 --> 01:03:16.079
get the cost out,
kinds of situations

01:03:16.366 --> 01:03:19.540
and that's exactly what Compaq
needed with the new lower

01:03:19.828 --> 01:03:20.920
cost product line.

01:03:21.204 --> 01:03:22.844
In our CEO forum this
week, we take a look

01:03:23.123 --> 01:03:25.751
at the art of competing on
the international scene.

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:28.170
American companies
versus the Japanese.

01:03:28.461 --> 01:03:30.634
Do you worry about
the competition that's

01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:32.799
coming from the Far
East and from Europe,

01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:34.571
particularly in the
computer industry?

01:03:34.676 --> 01:03:37.099
The Japanese certainly
have a lot of strengths.

01:03:37.387 --> 01:03:40.231
The Japanese company has major
competitors in the long term.

01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:42.609
Foreign manufacturers
got to be pretty good.

01:03:42.892 --> 01:03:46.317
Quality improved, and
essentially, for someone

01:03:46.604 --> 01:03:50.029
like Compaq, they no
longer could get that price

01:03:50.316 --> 01:03:51.909
advantage that they once had.

01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:55.367
You wouldn't want to buy these
things for $3,000 anymore.

01:03:55.655 --> 01:03:57.407
Could you buy them for $1,000?

01:03:57.699 --> 01:03:59.076
Do I hear $950?

01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:01.995
The new notebooks
like Toshiba's T-1000,

01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:05.461
Tandy's 1,100-FD and
Zenus Mini Sport are

01:04:05.749 --> 01:04:07.672
in the $1,000 to $2,000 range.

01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:13.090
At the high end, about
$4,000, Compaq LTE 286.

01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:15.383
We had companies like
Dell Computer actually

01:04:15.675 --> 01:04:18.098
begin to build better
and better products,

01:04:18.386 --> 01:04:20.354
and they were selling
them at a lower price.

01:04:20.638 --> 01:04:22.265
Compaq, the Houston giant,

01:04:22.557 --> 01:04:24.597
has been facing an advertising
assault from the much

01:04:24.851 --> 01:04:26.273
smaller Dell Computer.

01:04:26.561 --> 01:04:29.531
The industry can't recall
anything like these biting ads

01:04:29.814 --> 01:04:31.612
comparing features and price.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:36.076
The Dell ad calls Dell
appealing and Compaq appalling.

01:04:36.362 --> 01:04:37.830
Dell, top of the mark.

01:04:38.114 --> 01:04:40.333
Compaq, top of the mark-ups.

01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:42.585
Compaq is not amused.

01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:46.089
You can't survive, I believe,
for very long at least,

01:04:46.372 --> 01:04:48.372
just by selling the same
products at a lower price.

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:49.835
And there were people

01:04:50.126 --> 01:04:52.424
who said we need to get a low
cost product out there now

01:04:52.712 --> 01:04:55.807
and take on these people.

01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:58.264
That was primarily
led by Pfeiffer.

01:05:01.846 --> 01:05:03.286
I think it has been
a little bit more

01:05:03.515 --> 01:05:07.110
difficult for them to
keep up with the changing

01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:08.485
in technology.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:10.331
Compaq, a darling of Wall Street

01:05:10.355 --> 01:05:12.278
that could do little
wrong in the past,

01:05:12.565 --> 01:05:15.068
found itself on the
market's bad side last week,

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.782
Compaq's stock plunged.

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:19.744
On paper, combined
losses to all shareholders

01:05:20.031 --> 01:05:22.409
of more than $740 million.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.954
It certainly is a stumble in
the eyes of the stockholders.

01:05:26.246 --> 01:05:31.548
We didn't want to disappoint
relative to expectations,

01:05:31.835 --> 01:05:33.270
but I think you've got
to differentiate that

01:05:33.294 --> 01:05:34.796
from the actual
health of the company.

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:39.264
Ben, with some
prodding from Pfeiffer,

01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:42.930
was becoming paranoid that we
would not be able to recognize,

01:05:43.221 --> 01:05:46.896
and switch, and move, from as
high a quality provider as we

01:05:47.183 --> 01:05:50.562
were to low cost computers.

01:05:50.854 --> 01:05:52.731
We certainly
started seeing changes

01:05:53.022 --> 01:05:59.155
in marketing strategies,
changes in the competitor base,

01:05:59.445 --> 01:06:02.119
changes in the
importance of pricing.

01:06:02.407 --> 01:06:04.375
The essential view
was that Rod could not

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:07.378
adapt to what the company
needed going forward.

01:06:07.662 --> 01:06:09.039
Ben had other concerns about it.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:15.463
He was more concerned
about me losing

01:06:15.753 --> 01:06:16.793
commitment to the company.

01:06:17.046 --> 01:06:20.892
Rod was working on
a low cost concept,

01:06:21.176 --> 01:06:27.104
but I don't think he was pushing
it enough to satisfy the board.

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:29.734
The chairman of your company
is a guy named Ben Rosen.

01:06:30.018 --> 01:06:33.318
What's the chemistry
between the two of you?

01:06:33.605 --> 01:06:35.323
I'd say Ben and I
are very good friends.

01:06:35.607 --> 01:06:39.328
Ben joined Compaq at a time
when we were just forming,

01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:41.409
and I think he's played
a key role in helping

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:43.414
guide us along the way.

01:06:43.698 --> 01:06:45.458
We have a lot of mutual
respect, and we bring

01:06:45.575 --> 01:06:48.454
different things to the party.

01:06:48.745 --> 01:06:50.848
You have to
give Ben credit for two things.

01:06:50.872 --> 01:06:53.091
One, he saw that the
vision was a real vision.

01:06:53.374 --> 01:06:57.254
He got it right away because
they did finance the plan,

01:06:57.545 --> 01:07:00.640
and then at each
stage thereafter

01:07:00.924 --> 01:07:04.394
he encouraged and supported.

01:07:04.677 --> 01:07:07.556
Without Ben Rosen Compaq
Computer Corporation

01:07:07.847 --> 01:07:09.087
would not be where it is today.

01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:13.857
The board did not want

01:07:14.145 --> 01:07:22.145
to take any action against
Rod, but they got to the point

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:27.500
where they felt like
we had to do something.

01:07:48.721 --> 01:07:50.361
Ben decided that he might want

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.000
to create a situation
where there's

01:07:52.183 --> 01:07:55.278
kind of two bosses,
Pfeiffer and Rod,

01:07:55.561 --> 01:08:01.034
because of a loss
of confidence in us.

01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:02.878
There are
some management changes

01:08:02.902 --> 01:08:05.997
that you make because an
opportunity is created

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:10.127
by bringing that new person
in, and even at the time,

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:14.790
there was no evidence
of that at Compaq.

01:08:15.081 --> 01:08:16.934
I don't
question the motives of it.

01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:21.087
I think Ben was
genuinely concerned,

01:08:21.379 --> 01:08:25.350
I mean there's just
no doubt about it.

01:08:25.633 --> 01:08:26.993
Rod wouldn't compromise

01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:28.560
and take the dual leadership.

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:34.524
We were getting ready to have a
board meeting and Rod told me.

01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:36.607
He said, you know, Jim,
they're going to vote

01:08:36.894 --> 01:08:39.613
today on whether to remove me.

01:08:39.897 --> 01:08:41.569
My attitude when We
started Compaq was I

01:08:41.858 --> 01:08:45.078
would be ready to move aside
if that ever was necessary,

01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:46.921
and I thank the other
founders of Compaq

01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:49.698
had the same attitude.

01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:52.618
That night of the board meeting,

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:58.462
it was 10:30, 11:00
o'clock at night.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.296
I got a call from Jim.

01:09:13.514 --> 01:09:14.783
I can only say there was

01:09:14.807 --> 01:09:16.184
open weeping in the hallways.

01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:22.386
Going on without
him was almost unimaginable.

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.912
I had quit Compaq that day.

01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:33.426
It was like the heart and soul

01:09:33.451 --> 01:09:35.294
of the company being torn out.

01:09:38.456 --> 01:09:40.576
I went ahead and
turned my resignation in.

01:09:44.252 --> 01:09:47.381
I cannot even
think of being tired of what

01:09:47.673 --> 01:09:49.640
I'm doing and the
opportunity that I

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:51.553
see at Compaq in
the same fault...

01:09:51.844 --> 01:09:53.029
They are two different things.

01:09:53.054 --> 01:09:55.773
I see so much
challenge out there,

01:09:56.057 --> 01:09:58.151
a challenge that, I
believe, we're capable of,

01:09:58.434 --> 01:10:00.311
and yet I really want
to see it through.

01:10:04.273 --> 01:10:06.073
Ben convinced himself that this

01:10:06.275 --> 01:10:07.401
was the right thing to make.

01:10:10.488 --> 01:10:11.740
He lost it.

01:10:12.031 --> 01:10:15.251
He said several tears
over the decision.

01:10:20.206 --> 01:10:24.131
It was inevitable
that there'd be a change.

01:10:34.303 --> 01:10:35.663
It was a very sad time.

01:10:40.351 --> 01:10:44.197
It sunk in, what had really
happened and what it meant.

01:10:47.608 --> 01:10:49.485
It took a very
long time before it

01:10:49.777 --> 01:10:53.532
finally began to feel normal
not to be there every clay.

01:10:53.823 --> 01:10:57.123
It was tough, it was tough
on... it was hard on me.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.873
Compaq's focus on portability

01:11:43.164 --> 01:11:45.041
was the beginning of
mobility and mattering

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:53.333
to the technology industry,
and everything that we do today

01:11:53.966 --> 01:11:56.845
is really driven by
the ethic that if you

01:11:57.136 --> 01:12:00.731
can't do it While you're moving
around, it's not very valuable.

01:12:01.015 --> 01:12:03.313
And we can thank
Compaq for all of that.

01:12:03.601 --> 01:12:06.320
My dad would always look at
some of these cell phones,

01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:09.153
or some of the newer
computers, and say,

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.943
are you responsible
for all of this stuff?

01:12:12.235 --> 01:12:13.435
Well, yeah, it's a good thing.

01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:15.488
I use iPhones, I use iPads, and I

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.499
do know that if Compaq
developed those products... now,

01:12:18.783 --> 01:12:20.385
I'm not taking anything
away from those guys.

01:12:20.409 --> 01:12:22.471
Those guys did magnificent
job, and they can sell them

01:12:22.495 --> 01:12:26.625
to dead people, but if we
did them they'd work better,

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:28.543
I know that.

01:12:28.834 --> 01:12:31.963
If anybody had tried to
tell me how successful.

01:12:32.255 --> 01:12:36.351
Compaq would become,
I would've just said,

01:12:36.634 --> 01:12:39.478
you're blowing smoke.

01:12:39.762 --> 01:12:40.763
That's not possible.

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:45.310
We never, ever had
any idea that this

01:12:45.601 --> 01:12:49.105
would be as explosively
successful as it was, never.

01:12:49.397 --> 01:12:50.997
I don't think we were
ever trying to take

01:12:51.148 --> 01:12:54.197
down the biggest company, ever.

01:12:54.485 --> 01:12:56.408
We were trying to survive.

01:12:56.696 --> 01:13:01.372
Here was a product and
an idea for a start up

01:13:01.659 --> 01:13:05.084
that should have been in
Silicon Valley, if anywhere.

01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:05.963
But Houston?

01:13:06.247 --> 01:13:07.247
Give me a break.

01:13:07.498 --> 01:13:10.172
I had no idea we
were going to be doing

01:13:10.459 --> 01:13:11.562
a billion dollar
company... I mean,

01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:13.759
the billion dollar baby was IBM.

01:13:14.046 --> 01:13:16.720
How can I even conceive,
or think, that we

01:13:17.008 --> 01:13:20.763
would be an IBM in that sense?

01:13:21.053 --> 01:13:25.274
No way, not the slightest.

01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:28.732
I would still like to
have a Mexican restaurant.
