WEBVTT

00:18.200 --> 00:22.666
You're in Springwood now
and you're all mine.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.100
'Okay, I'll give you a hint.'

00:52.166 --> 00:55.566
He's handsome, rich

00:55.633 --> 00:58.266
popular, muscular,
hot, happening

00:58.333 --> 01:00.866
andcaptain
of the football team.

01:00.933 --> 01:02.733
Kurt Walmart asked you out?

01:02.800 --> 01:05.933
No. Not exactly. I asked him.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.833
- Heidi!
- Well, he said yes.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.033
And since your mom's playin'
bridge at my house tonight

01:11.100 --> 01:13.333
I was kinda hopin' that
I could bring him over here.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.366
- No way!
- Come on, Lis.

01:15.433 --> 01:17.633
You're my closest, best,
most personal friend.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
Where else can I turn?

01:19.166 --> 01:22.533
Heidi, if you bring him here,
you know what's gonna happen.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.866
That's the plan.

01:23.933 --> 01:26.933
Please.Please.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.733
Oh! I don't know why I let

01:27.000 --> 01:29.733
you talk me into these things.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.333
Thank you.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.333
There's one other small problem.

01:35.933 --> 01:38.833
- How small?
- Practically invisible.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.366
I promised the Burtons
I'd sit for them tonight.

01:43.433 --> 01:46.366
Not a chance! I have
to study for my biology exam.

01:46.433 --> 01:48.100
Lis, you can study over there.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.500
No!

01:49.566 --> 01:50.966
Absolutely not.

01:51.033 --> 01:53.666
Come on, if you do this for me,
I'll owe you my life.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.000
Forget it.

01:55.066 --> 01:57.600
Lis, you're my only hope.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.900
I'm begging you.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.566
What are you gonna do for me?

02:04.633 --> 02:06.600
Mm...I'll set you up
with one of Kurt's friends?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.666
Done! You're a lifesaver.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.966
Um, here's the Burtons' address.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.933
I already phoned them and told
them that you'd be filling in.

02:16.966 --> 02:19.066
I have faith in our friendship.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.633
Well, I better get home
and get started on my hair.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.733
Wait a second.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.700
Heidi, I don't even know
the Burtons.

02:24.766 --> 02:26.133
How many kids do they have

02:26.200 --> 02:27.700
Don't worry about it.
It's a piece of cake.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.833
Hello?

02:53.566 --> 02:55.133
Hello?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.866
Got you! You're dead!

02:58.466 --> 02:59.800
Hi.

02:59.866 --> 03:02.100
I'm Lisa, the sitter?

03:02.166 --> 03:04.533
My name's Will
and I'm this many years old.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.366
Hi, Will. Are your parents here?

03:13.666 --> 03:14.666
What was that?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.500
There it is again.

03:23.566 --> 03:26.266
Oh, that.
That's my sister, Patty.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.266
'Patty.'

03:39.333 --> 03:40.833
'Patty.'

03:41.800 --> 03:44.766
Patty cake. Yeah.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.000
Patty cake,
Patty cake, baker's man

03:47.066 --> 03:50.533
catch a babysitter
as fast as I can.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.066
So you want to be a babysitter?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.466
Wanna get paid?

03:55.533 --> 04:00.700
Rule number one,
don't die on the job.

04:08.566 --> 04:10.366
Hi, I'm Jack Burton,
you must be Lisa?

04:10.433 --> 04:12.600
Hello. Um, can I talk
to you about this noi--

04:12.666 --> 04:14.266
Jill, come on,
we're already late!

04:14.333 --> 04:15.600
Uh, Mr. Burton, I was
wondering if I could

04:15.666 --> 04:16.666
ask you about
this noise that I--

04:16.733 --> 04:18.633
Why is it that wives
go out of their way

04:18.700 --> 04:21.500
so that their husbands can never
get anywhere on time?

04:24.166 --> 04:25.533
Jill?

04:26.866 --> 04:27.900
Mr. Bur..

04:29.700 --> 04:31.800
Come on, honey, we're
already four minutes late.

04:31.866 --> 04:33.333
Okay, dear, I'm ready.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.633
Make sure William
is in bed by 10 o'clock.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.600
Lisa, remember, under
no circumstances are you

04:40.666 --> 04:41.966
to open this basement door.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.700
Mrs. Burton, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.233
- Oh, didn't Heidi tell you?
- 'Tell me what?'

04:47.300 --> 04:49.033
- Honey..
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.466
- We're really late.
- But what about the--

04:50.533 --> 04:53.066
Oh, it'll be just fine
if you don't open the door.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.466
If you get hungry,
fix yourself a sandwich.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.733
And you, young man,
behave yourself.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.800
Will, what was Heidi
supposed to tell me?

05:05.866 --> 05:08.700
You mean about my sister, Patty?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.666
Yes, about your sister, Patty.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.133
Oh, she lives in the basement.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.733
She's been locked
in there a really long time.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.966
Why?

05:17.033 --> 05:20.233
When I was little
she tried to hurt me a lot.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.300
The doctors wanted her
to live in the hospital.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.333
My daddy wouldn't
let them take her.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.700
So he locked her
in the basement?

05:28.200 --> 05:30.933
- Do you ever go down there?
- Uh, I..

05:31.000 --> 05:32.533
Nobody does.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.433
Come on, it's bedtime.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.300
It's not 10 o'clock!

05:44.400 --> 05:46.000
Now.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.333
You have to read to me
before I can go to sleep.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.733
Sure.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.333
"I Was A Grade School Zombie.

06:10.066 --> 06:13.300
"By R. "Dog" Thomas."

06:15.333 --> 06:16.966
Your parents let you
read this stuff?

06:17.033 --> 06:19.033
They bought it for me.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.733
Wouldn't you rather hear
"Peter Pan"

06:21.800 --> 06:23.933
or maybe "Sleeping Beauty?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.633
I like this.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.000
Okay.

06:30.633 --> 06:31.900
Let's see.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.433
"I knew I was different
from the other kids when..

06:43.233 --> 06:48.133
"...and the grizzly hand
from hell reached out

06:48.200 --> 06:51.733
"and pulled her deeper
and deeper..

06:53.566 --> 06:55.900
"...and everybody was dead

06:55.966 --> 06:58.233
Every last one of them."

07:33.433 --> 07:34.766
Lisa, wake up, wake up!

07:34.833 --> 07:36.833
You didn't finish the story!

07:46.233 --> 07:47.266
'Tell me who you are'

07:47.333 --> 07:49.000
'and I'll call you back
as soon as I get in.'

07:50.833 --> 07:53.633
Heidi?
If you're there, pick up.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.666
'Oh! Wait till I get
my hands on you!'

07:57.733 --> 07:59.500
'You failed to mention
that the Burtons'

07:59.566 --> 08:01.833
'had a deranged daughter
locked in the basement!'

08:03.133 --> 08:05.000
I'm not thrilled
about it, Heidi.

08:06.633 --> 08:09.033
This is not
a normal family here.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.733
'I don't know why
I'm leaving you this message!'

08:12.800 --> 08:14.200
'This is my machine!'

08:15.333 --> 08:16.800
Damn it!

10:45.933 --> 10:48.033
Oh, my God. Will!

10:57.100 --> 11:00.866
Will? Will, are you out here?

11:00.933 --> 11:02.933
Will?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.100
Will!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.400
Will!

11:16.800 --> 11:20.166
- Help me, Lisa!
- No!

11:20.233 --> 11:22.400
- Lisa, please help me..
- Will!

12:00.600 --> 12:02.233
Will.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.200
What are you doing?

12:05.266 --> 12:06.566
I couldn't sleep.

12:06.633 --> 12:07.966
I like to listen.

12:08.033 --> 12:12.000
Oh, geez,
you scared the hell out of me.

12:12.066 --> 12:14.100
She misses me.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.566
- What?
- My sister, Patty.

12:16.633 --> 12:17.933
She misses me.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Will, go on up to bed.

12:23.066 --> 12:24.066
Go ahead.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.800
I'll be right up to tuck you in.

12:33.933 --> 12:34.933
Patty?

12:36.700 --> 12:37.800
Hello?

12:42.466 --> 12:44.100
Patty?

12:46.300 --> 12:48.200
Hello?

12:49.233 --> 12:51.300
Are you really in there?

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
I'm Lisa.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.533
Patty?

13:09.733 --> 13:14.400
'Heidi?Heidi,
if you don't pick up'

13:14.466 --> 13:17.300
'besides never talking to you
again, I'll float a rumor'

13:17.366 --> 13:19.933
'at school that you gave
Kurt your herpes.'

13:21.400 --> 13:23.900
- She's just kidding.
- 'Heidi?'

13:23.966 --> 13:26.566
'Heidi!'

13:26.633 --> 13:27.666
Lisa, is that you?

13:27.733 --> 13:29.066
Why didn't you tell me

13:29.133 --> 13:30.833
about the Burtons'
daughter, Patty?

13:32.233 --> 13:34.100
Look, can we discuss
this in the morning?

13:34.166 --> 13:37.000
No, we'll discuss this now.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.500
What is it you
were supposed to tell me

13:38.566 --> 13:40.100
about their daughter, Patty?

13:40.166 --> 13:43.800
Nothing! Just that
she's a little crazy.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.866
A little crazy?

13:45.933 --> 13:48.466
'She's not even
their real daughter.'

13:48.533 --> 13:51.600
Oh, well, then who are
Patty's real parents?

13:51.666 --> 13:53.100
'I don't really know.'

13:53.166 --> 13:54.466
Well, they say that her father's

13:54.533 --> 13:56.766
in the Springwood Asylum
for the criminally insane

13:56.833 --> 13:58.500
and that her mother
was a nurse there

13:58.566 --> 13:59.933
that she committed suicide.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.933
Then the Burtons' adopted her?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.166
Um, technically, Mr. Burton did.

14:04.233 --> 14:06.133
Um, the first Mrs. Burton died.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.133
They said Patty killed her.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.333
'But it could have
been an accident.'

14:09.400 --> 14:10.933
That's it. I'm out of here.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.200
Lis, what's the big deal?

14:12.266 --> 14:14.233
It's not like she can get
out of the basement.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.266
I don't care!
This is too weird. I'm leaving.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.200
I'm giving you 20 minutes
to get your butt over here.

14:21.266 --> 14:23.900
'Even if you don't show up,
I'm leaving in 20 minutes.'

14:25.300 --> 14:27.133
Okay, I'll be there.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.433
Geez.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.400
Ah!

15:26.733 --> 15:28.200
Ah!

16:12.033 --> 16:15.933
Oh, Jesus, Heidi. Don't do that.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.266
Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.333
Oh, thank God, you're here

16:18.400 --> 16:20.700
This place gives me the creeps.

16:20.766 --> 16:22.100
Can you wait a second
while I go upstairs

16:22.166 --> 16:24.433
and check on Will,
then you can leave.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.033
Okay, I've survived this long.

16:33.466 --> 16:34.500
Hello?

16:34.566 --> 16:35.866
'I'm leaving now, okay, Lis?'

16:35.933 --> 16:38.333
Heidi, that's not funny.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.600
'What's not funny?'

16:39.666 --> 16:41.800
You're calling me
from upstairs!

16:41.866 --> 16:43.400
'What are you talkin' about?'

16:43.466 --> 16:46.833
Heidi, stop it, come on.
You just went upstairs.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.166
'Lis, I'm at your house.'

16:49.233 --> 16:52.500
Stop kidding, Heidi.
It's not funny!

16:52.566 --> 16:55.400
'Lis, I don't know who's over
there, but it sure isn't me.'

16:55.466 --> 16:56.500
'Here, listen.'

16:56.566 --> 16:57.700
'Hi, this is Lisa.'

16:57.766 --> 16:59.366
'I'm not home
to answer this call'

16:59.433 --> 17:01.000
'so tell me who you are
and I'll call you back'

17:01.066 --> 17:02.500
'as soon as I get in.'

17:02.566 --> 17:05.266
Then if you're not upstairs..

17:05.333 --> 17:07.633
'Oh, my God, Lis,
get out of the house now.'

17:07.700 --> 17:09.766
'Help me, Lisa!'

17:09.833 --> 17:11.466
'Help me. Lisa, help me!'

17:11.533 --> 17:12.966
Let go of him!

17:52.266 --> 17:53.400
Oh, God!

17:54.600 --> 17:55.900
Will?

17:55.966 --> 17:57.200
Will!

17:57.266 --> 17:58.333
Answer me!

17:59.733 --> 18:01.000
God.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.400
I'm coming, Will, I'm coming!

18:17.933 --> 18:19.700
Will?

18:19.766 --> 18:20.933
Will, are you in there?

18:41.500 --> 18:43.866
'Let me out!'

18:43.933 --> 18:46.333
'Let me out!'

18:47.833 --> 18:49.800
'Let me out!'

18:49.866 --> 18:53.200
'Let me out!'

18:53.266 --> 18:54.666
'She's not here.'

18:54.733 --> 18:56.866
'So that had to be Lisa
that whizzed by us.'

18:56.933 --> 18:58.800
'I mean, it was Lisa's car.'

18:58.866 --> 19:00.533
I can't believe her.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.433
She left a six year old
up there all by himself.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.900
Some best friend.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.266
Heidi, what are you doing here?
Where's Lisa?

19:20.333 --> 19:21.833
Um, she had to get
up early tomorrow

19:21.900 --> 19:22.833
so I came over.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.233
This is Kurt.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.100
- Hello, Kurt.
- 'Hi.'

19:27.166 --> 19:28.733
Uh, I'm going up
to check on Will.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.433
- Here you go, Heidi.
- Thanks, Mr. Burton.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.333
Well, um, we'd better get going.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.800
Yeah.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.700
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.633
Honey, do you realize
it's almost been two years

20:05.700 --> 20:07.666
since we've seen Patty.

20:07.733 --> 20:11.333
It's dangerous to go down there.
You remember what she's like.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.100
She's-she's still our daughter.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.933
She was the daughter
you and Maggie adopted.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.833
'And look what happened
to Maggie.'

20:19.900 --> 20:21.266
Right here.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.266
That bloodstain never came out
of the floorboards.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.733
We had to lay carpet.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.966
I just wish
we had another choice.

20:28.033 --> 20:31.166
Jack, I worked in the asylum
for seven years.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.633
You should see the way patients
like Patty are treated there.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.033
It's much worse.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.000
'And even in the asylum,
those same patients'

20:37.066 --> 20:38.433
'are kept in isolation.'

20:38.500 --> 20:40.566
'No contact.'

20:40.633 --> 20:43.633
It's just not smart
we go down in that basement.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.733
She's not ready
for the outside world.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.733
I know. You're right.
I..

20:51.166 --> 20:54.433
At least she's at home and
at least we're still a family.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.600
Goodnight, Patty.
We love you.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.633
When will they learn?
When will they learn?

21:42.700 --> 21:47.166
You never, ever send a girl
to do a man's job.

21:47.233 --> 21:50.333
Besides,
I've got evenings free.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.933
Just check my records.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.800
Uh, you'll find that I'm great
with kids.

22:06.666 --> 22:09.733
You were the last people
to see her alive

22:09.800 --> 22:12.200
when she was babysitting
for you.

22:12.266 --> 22:13.266
We were shocked when we heard

22:13.333 --> 22:15.200
about the accident
the next morning.

22:15.266 --> 22:18.633
That was a month ago today.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.500
I've kept her room
exactly the same.

22:21.566 --> 22:26.333
Exactly the way she left it
for when she comes home.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.800
Mrs. Wax, the police said
Lisa was killed in the accident.

22:29.866 --> 22:32.166
They're lying.
They never found her body.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.566
I know my baby is still alive.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.800
But your daughter's car
was completely incinerated

22:36.866 --> 22:38.566
Nobody could have survived

22:40.833 --> 22:42.966
Lisa graduates next month

22:43.033 --> 22:45.900
and we've designed her
prom dress together.

22:45.966 --> 22:48.033
She's gonna look so beautiful.

22:49.266 --> 22:51.033
Oh!

22:51.100 --> 22:53.366
Ah, you, you'll make sure these
get around the neighborhood.

22:53.433 --> 22:54.700
- Won't you?
- Of course.

22:54.766 --> 22:56.733
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

23:00.566 --> 23:02.000
No!

23:02.666 --> 23:05.366
No, mom! Mom!

23:05.433 --> 23:10.033
Mom, I'm here.
Mom, I'm here!

23:11.366 --> 23:12.866
Poor woman.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.033
When is she going to accept
her daughter is dead?

23:19.633 --> 23:21.233
Honey, did you feed
Patty this morning?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.233
Her favorite.
Bacon and eggs.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.333
'Poor child.'

23:28.666 --> 23:31.100
Please!

23:33.666 --> 23:35.300
'Please.'

23:43.366 --> 23:46.966
'Ah! That's music to my ears.'

23:47.033 --> 23:51.000
'Looks like Lisa's got herself
a new mailing address.'

23:56.066 --> 23:58.466
Maybe she wants out of here.

23:58.533 --> 24:02.533
Or maybe she's, uh, lookin'
for some room service.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.733
You know what I mean.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.233
I know you're coming home.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.100
I know you're coming home.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.400
Coming home.
Coming home.

24:22.933 --> 24:25.066
I'm afraid you're not gonn
find very much in there.

24:25.133 --> 24:26.533
'Oh, please!
Please, don't run away.'

24:26.600 --> 24:29.200
'Don't run away. Please, please.
I won't, I won't hurt you.'

24:29.266 --> 24:31.233
Uh, do you live around here?

24:32.366 --> 24:35.400
Uh, do you have
some place to sleep?

24:35.466 --> 24:37.800
What about your parents?

24:37.866 --> 24:40.200
Well, they must be worried
sick about you.

24:42.333 --> 24:45.166
Y-you know, I have a daughter
exactly your age.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.233
'She's getting ready
for her prom.'

24:49.266 --> 24:50.700
Would you like to
come home with me?

24:51.900 --> 24:53.900
'I can make you something
hot to eat.'

24:56.100 --> 24:57.733
Would you like something
hot to eat?

24:58.766 --> 25:00.733
Come home with me.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.666
Come on, baby. Come here.

25:02.733 --> 25:04.433
Come on. Come on home with me.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.233
'I-I'll fix you something hot.'

25:11.233 --> 25:12.900
You probably can't even
remember the last time

25:12.966 --> 25:14.400
you had a hot meal.

25:14.466 --> 25:16.400
Oh, I hope you'll like this.

25:16.466 --> 25:20.233
My Lisa. Oh, she loves to eat.

25:20.300 --> 25:24.666
Her favorite is my
blueberry walnut cake.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.066
I think I'll bake one today.

25:27.133 --> 25:28.533
'For when she comes home.'

25:30.833 --> 25:33.166
Why don't you go upstairs
and take a shower, okay?

25:33.233 --> 25:35.233
'Cause it's gonna take a while.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.000
I'm coming, Will.
I'm coming.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.300
Will.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.833
Will, are you in there?

27:19.300 --> 27:20.933
'Patty! No!'

27:21.766 --> 27:23.000
'No!'

27:32.733 --> 27:34.533
'Let me out!'

27:36.633 --> 27:38.133
'Let me out!'

27:39.100 --> 27:41.000
'Let me out!'

27:42.933 --> 27:44.933
'Let me out!'

28:00.166 --> 28:02.433
Oh.

28:08.533 --> 28:10.066
Hot off the stove.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.366
I hope you like it.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.500
Mother, have you seen
my makeup kit?

28:14.566 --> 28:17.666
- Lisa?
- I can't find it anywhere.

28:17.733 --> 28:19.400
You're back.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.066
Oh, what's going on?

28:23.133 --> 28:25.433
- I've gotta go.
- 'Why?'

28:25.500 --> 28:27.633
I just can't stay.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.400
I'm changing, mother

28:29.466 --> 28:33.566
and I really think
I need my makeup.

28:33.633 --> 28:35.833
I just can't let you
see me like this.

29:02.966 --> 29:04.733
There is some more
if you're still hungry.

29:16.733 --> 29:18.733
Lisa.

29:21.966 --> 29:24.000
You aren't dead.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.800
You have come home.

29:33.933 --> 29:37.533
Oh, I promise.
We'll never be apart again

29:49.200 --> 29:50.533
Ow.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.300
We're all out of blueberry
walnut cake downstairs

30:08.366 --> 30:10.900
and I have nothing
to wear for tomorrow.

30:12.366 --> 30:13.733
Who are you?

30:14.833 --> 30:17.133
Mother, don't be ridiculous.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.433
It's me, Lisa.
Your daughter.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.900
Lisa is downstairs getting a,
getting a glass of milk.

30:25.966 --> 30:30.033
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.000
'Mother, you know I don't like'

30:32.066 --> 30:34.033
'other people sleeping
in my bed.'

30:35.000 --> 30:37.066
You shouldn't be here.

30:37.133 --> 30:39.600
And wearing my clothes.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.600
I want you to leave.

30:44.266 --> 30:46.633
Okay, but remember, mother

30:46.700 --> 30:48.933
if you don't get rid of her,
I will.

31:18.233 --> 31:20.666
- Lisa?
- What is it, mother?

31:20.733 --> 31:23.233
Ah, oh, nothing.

31:23.300 --> 31:26.133
You just...you forgot
to put the milk away.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.600
I'm sorry, mother.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.100
- Goodnight.
- Night, mother.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.966
We're gonna have to
take some new photographs

31:36.033 --> 31:37.733
'for those frames, huh?'

31:38.666 --> 31:40.200
Okay.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.200
Don't!

31:42.266 --> 31:45.933
Don't ever close my door,
mother. I want it open.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.200
Oh..

31:48.266 --> 31:51.866
- I'm sorry, honey.
- All the way.

31:51.933 --> 31:54.933
I-I don't like being closed in.

32:01.466 --> 32:03.533
Are you my Lisa?

32:22.700 --> 32:25.233
Thanks again for picking
little Will up from school

32:25.300 --> 32:26.400
No problem.

32:27.733 --> 32:29.100
Will, what do you say to Heidi?

32:29.166 --> 32:30.633
Can I have a quarter?

32:34.600 --> 32:37.433
Heidi, would you mind dropping
something off at Mrs. Wax's?

32:39.233 --> 32:41.366
No, not at all.

32:41.433 --> 32:42.466
You know, I've really
been worried

32:42.533 --> 32:44.333
about her since Lisa's accident.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.333
'She's been acting
very strangely.'

32:48.166 --> 32:49.800
'It must be hard for you.'

32:50.733 --> 32:53.466
Yeah, Lisa was my best friend.

32:53.533 --> 32:55.533
I still can't believe
she's gone.

32:56.966 --> 32:59.900
Things happen in life
that have no explanation.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.600
This is my famous nut cake.

33:13.966 --> 33:16.033
I'll see that she gets it.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.966
Oh, thanks.

33:40.033 --> 33:41.066
Hey, aren't you
gonna say goodbye

33:41.133 --> 33:43.100
to Lisa before you go?

33:44.900 --> 33:48.133
Mrs. Wax, I know it must be
hard for you to accept it.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.500
I mean, it's hard for me too,
but Lisa is dead.

33:51.566 --> 33:53.200
Oh, don't be silly.
She's upstairs.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.033
Mrs. Wax, maybe you should
talk to someone about this

33:58.166 --> 33:59.966
Are you two arguing again?

34:00.033 --> 34:03.033
Oh, that's it. You must be
having another fight.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.733
I think you should
patch things up.

34:06.466 --> 34:08.633
- Mrs. Wax, you should..
- 'Mother.'

34:08.700 --> 34:10.133
Uh-oh!

34:10.200 --> 34:12.866
She's looking for these.
We're working on her prom dress.

34:12.933 --> 34:14.966
Um, you run upstairs
and give her those

34:15.033 --> 34:16.600
and I've got to run
to the store and I'll be back

34:16.666 --> 34:18.100
in a little bit.

34:26.366 --> 34:27.933
Lisa?

34:29.966 --> 34:32.033
- Lisa, is that you?
- 'Yes.'

34:32.566 --> 34:34.433
Lisa!

34:37.766 --> 34:39.366
Have a good time, girls.

34:39.433 --> 34:41.233
Don't play too rough.

35:13.066 --> 35:15.333
- What are you doing?
- I warned you, mother.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.333
If you didn't get rid of her,
I would.

35:23.733 --> 35:25.533
No!

35:35.466 --> 35:37.866
Wake up!
Wake up!

35:37.933 --> 35:40.466
Oh, thank, thank God
you're, you're alright.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.366
You were having a nightmare.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.633
Oh!

35:44.700 --> 35:47.100
She won't,
she won't leave me alone.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.533
'Who, mother?'

35:49.766 --> 35:52.533
That girl.
The girl in all my dreams.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.866
She-she says she's my daughter.

35:54.933 --> 35:57.900
But I'm your daughter, right?

35:57.966 --> 35:59.600
- Well--
- I am, mother.

35:59.666 --> 36:03.266
Oh! Well, yes.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.133
Yes, but she,
she says you're not and..

36:08.133 --> 36:09.533
...and she wants to kill you.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.700
We can't allow that now, can we?

36:12.900 --> 36:14.966
I don't wanna dream that again.

36:15.033 --> 36:17.033
I know.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.700
The next time she appears
in your dream..

36:19.766 --> 36:21.633
...you'll have to kill her

36:21.700 --> 36:23.600
Then she'll never
bother you again.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.333
In my dream?

36:30.866 --> 36:33.100
Kill her in my dream?

36:33.166 --> 36:35.100
It's the only way, mother.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.166
Mom! Mom, I'm home--

37:25.233 --> 37:26.500
- 'Stop!'
- What?

37:27.333 --> 37:29.433
Stop or I'll shoot.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.300
Mother, what are you doing?

37:32.566 --> 37:35.500
- You don't belong here.
- What?

37:35.566 --> 37:37.333
You're trying to hurt my Lisa.

37:38.433 --> 37:40.566
I'm Lisa.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.100
'Mother, I was trapped
in a basement.'

37:43.166 --> 37:44.666
I had to dig my way out.

37:44.733 --> 37:47.533
I was trying to get back to you
and I was so scared.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.733
- I have to stop you.
- 'Why?'

37:53.400 --> 37:55.133
'Mom, what's wrong?'

37:55.766 --> 37:58.300
It's me. Lisa.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.300
You're not Lisa. You're lying.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.833
'Look at me.'

38:03.900 --> 38:06.233
Don't you recognize
your own daughter?

38:07.333 --> 38:10.233
It's me. I'm Lisa.

38:10.300 --> 38:11.633
'No, she's not.'

38:15.300 --> 38:16.933
I'm Lisa.

38:17.666 --> 38:19.033
What is this?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.333
- 'Who are you?'
- I'm Lisa Wax.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.633
Mother.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.166
Who is this person
and why is she in our house?

38:32.233 --> 38:35.466
The question is, what are
you doing in our house?

38:35.533 --> 38:38.166
Remember, mother.
This is your dream.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.833
Kill her now and she'll never
bother us again.

38:44.033 --> 38:45.500
Oh, my God.

38:47.466 --> 38:49.400
I know you.

38:50.666 --> 38:52.433
You're that Burton girl.

38:54.166 --> 38:57.300
- 'You did this to me.'
- Kill her, kill her now.

38:57.366 --> 38:59.233
Don't forget
she is your nightmare.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.766
No! Wait!

39:01.833 --> 39:03.333
Listen to me.

39:04.466 --> 39:06.166
'She's lying.'

39:06.233 --> 39:08.633
'Her name is Patty.'

39:08.700 --> 39:10.333
'Patty Burton.'

39:11.500 --> 39:13.133
You remember, mother?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.200
I went there
that night to babysit.

39:15.933 --> 39:18.100
'Remember?'

39:18.166 --> 39:19.866
'You remember Mr. Burton?'

39:19.933 --> 39:23.133
Mom, remember
his first wife died

39:23.200 --> 39:25.033
and they think Patty killed her.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.700
'And then she tried to kill her
stepbrother.'

39:27.766 --> 39:29.700
'And her parents keep her
locked up in the basement'

39:29.766 --> 39:32.200
because they don't want to put
her in a mental hospital.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.233
- She's lying.
- 'No, I'm not.'

39:36.666 --> 39:40.033
Mother, when I opened the door
to the basement that night

39:40.100 --> 39:42.066
'she locked me in.'

39:42.133 --> 39:44.100
Shoot her. Shoot her now!

39:45.900 --> 39:48.100
- Well, I don't know..
- Yes, you do.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.133
- I'm your daughter. She's not.
- I don't know..

39:50.200 --> 39:52.666
She tried to kill me.
Remember?

39:52.733 --> 39:54.966
'Remember your dream?
Remember how real it was?'

39:55.033 --> 39:57.900
Don't listen to her.

39:57.966 --> 40:00.333
Mom, she's making it up.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.933
Am I?

40:03.733 --> 40:06.533
Remember, mother,
you promised to bake me

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
a blueberry walnut cake,
didn't you?

40:08.466 --> 40:10.900
- Oh, how did she know?
- Oh!

40:10.966 --> 40:12.933
And the prom.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.133
We worked so hard
designing that dress.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.633
The dress..

40:16.700 --> 40:18.633
It's my dress.

40:23.866 --> 40:26.000
You lying bitch!

40:26.066 --> 40:27.466
I'll kill you.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.833
Oh.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.533
Will, what are you
doing in there?

41:45.266 --> 41:47.900
What, daddy?

41:50.733 --> 41:52.500
Who's in the kitchen?

41:57.500 --> 41:59.366
Wonder what that noise was

41:59.433 --> 42:00.500
Jack.

42:05.666 --> 42:07.533
Who opened this door?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
What's going on here?

42:20.066 --> 42:22.466
Oh, my God.

42:29.333 --> 42:31.733
Patty, are you in there?

42:33.833 --> 42:35.333
Patty?

42:37.633 --> 42:39.000
Patty?

42:41.633 --> 42:42.933
Patty?

42:47.600 --> 42:48.700
Patty, no!

42:54.333 --> 42:56.366
'Patty, Patty, open the door.'

42:56.433 --> 42:59.833
'We love you, honey, please,
just open the door.'

43:00.933 --> 43:02.800
- 'Patty!'
- 'Patty!'

43:02.866 --> 43:04.800
- 'Patty!'
- 'Patty!'

43:14.966 --> 43:16.700
Hi, Will.

43:18.833 --> 43:20.100
I'm home.

43:31.466 --> 43:33.466
'Baby, open the door.'

43:33.533 --> 43:35.100
'Open the door, sweetheart.'

43:35.166 --> 43:37.533
'We love you.
We do, Patty, we do.'

43:37.600 --> 43:41.400
'Just, please, open the door!'

43:41.466 --> 43:43.633
- 'Patty!'
- 'Patty!'

43:43.700 --> 43:46.200
- 'We love you.'
- 'Patty!'

43:46.266 --> 43:48.766
'Patty!'

43:48.833 --> 43:50.800
'Patty!'

43:54.766 --> 43:56.633
Wallie!

43:56.700 --> 43:57.966
Beeve!

43:58.033 --> 43:59.233
Ward!

43:59.300 --> 44:01.933
June, I am home!

44:02.000 --> 44:06.700
Oh, nothing breaks me up
like these holiday reunions.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.000
Why, thanks.

44:14.066 --> 44:17.700
Well, guess, I'll just be
heading home for the holidays.

44:17.766 --> 44:20.666
Well, I can probably use
some help carving the turkey.

44:20.733 --> 44:23.666
That's, uh, that's what we call
pa back home, turkey.

44:23.733 --> 44:25.966
Get it?
