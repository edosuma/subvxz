[wexler]
you know it's really too bad,

00:05.805 --> 00:07.271
We could of had
some real fun together

00:07.274 --> 00:09.274
[three] she got blown
out the air lock.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.710
She held on,
waiting to die and she didn't.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
What the hell is she?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.414
Think you could survive
a bullet between the eyes?

whatever this thing is,

00:21.555 --> 00:24.323
3 corporations were
willing to kill for it.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.591
What the hell was that?

00:25.593 --> 00:26.458
The field's become unstable.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.394
Shut it down.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.738
[heavy breathing]

00:53.487 --> 00:54.820

what the hell is this?

00:54.822 --> 00:56.221
[three]
kid's a stowaway.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.524
I was just trying to scare her.

00:58.526 --> 01:02.061
I wasn't gonna
space her, i swear.

01:02.063 --> 01:05.297
[five panting]

01:05.299 --> 01:07.066
[three] at least let's
get something for her.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.400
[six]
shut up, boone.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.536
Look guys, she's an asset.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.771
She's got a head for
mechanics and tech.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.273
[two]
i don't give a shit.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.241
I don't want her on this ship.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.409
[one]
why the hell not?

01:17.411 --> 01:20.612
[two]
she's a child.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.547
[one]
griff's right.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.415
We should keep her.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.550
It's even up.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.485
Your call, ryo.

two, i've completed my analysis

02:08.529 --> 02:11.430
Of all available sensor data
pertaining to the explosion.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.831
Would you like to hear it?

02:12.833 --> 02:15.267
[two]
maybe just the short version.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.668
[android]
it was the temporary manifestatn

02:16.670 --> 02:19.872
Of what's known in layman's
terms as a white hole.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.123
[two]
let me guess.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.373
The opposite of a black hole?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.976
[android]
precisely.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.577
It's an area of space-time
which cannot be entered

02:25.579 --> 02:27.713
From the outside,
but which is capable

02:27.715 --> 02:29.815
Of emitting vast quantities
of matter and energy.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.584
[two] is there any chance it was
a coincidence that it manifested

02:32.586 --> 02:35.420
Five minutes after we
delivered that device?

02:35.422 --> 02:37.556
[android]
it would be highly unlikely.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.558
Research into white hole
technology was banned

02:39.560 --> 02:42.227
By the galactic authority
several years ago

02:42.229 --> 02:44.563
Because of its potential to
de-stabilize the current balance

02:44.565 --> 02:47.633
Of power between
the major corporations.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.469
[two] how many people
were on that planet?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.738
[android] the world was
otherwise uninhabited,

02:52.740 --> 02:56.909
So the death toll was limited
to those on the research facili.

02:56.911 --> 02:59.912
Are you sure you
want the number?

02:59.914 --> 03:02.748
[two]
how many?

03:02.750 --> 03:05.450
[android]
a little over 15,000.

continue their investigation int

03:28.209 --> 03:31.210
They've classified as
an extinction level event

03:31.212 --> 03:35.414
On a hab-1 world under
the directorship of the mikkei .

03:35.416 --> 03:38.483
Satellite imagery captured
the planet's final moments...

03:39.520 --> 03:42.254
The incident, which claimed
the lives of all on-site person,

03:42.256 --> 03:44.723
Is believed to have been
triggered by illegal research

03:44.725 --> 03:47.693
Into what has been termed
a "doomsday weapon"

03:47.695 --> 03:50.362
Linked to white hole technology.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.831
Representatives of
the mikkei combine offered conds

03:52.833 --> 03:55.400
To all those affected
but have otherwise refused

03:55.402 --> 03:59.738
Comment pending completion
of the official inquiry.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.690
Is that it?

04:01.691 --> 04:03.641
This was the most
relevant of several reports.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.577
No mention anywhere
of our involvement?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.645
None.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.714
Guys, we're in the clear.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.950
[one] just because we're
not in the official news

04:11.952 --> 04:13.719
Doesn't mean we're in the clear.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.887
All i'm saying is
it could be worse.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.723
Mikkei could've
hung us out to dry,

04:17.725 --> 04:18.924
But they didn't, why?

04:18.926 --> 04:21.260
Probably because they
think that we got played

04:21.262 --> 04:22.995
Just like they did.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.729
We're not nearly as screwed
as we thought we were.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.666
[android] i'm receiving a coded
subspace transmission.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.835
It's from calchek.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.470
Patch him through.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.771
What do you want?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.474
Oh, you--you are all so screwed.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.942
[one] and by "screwed" you mean.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.944
[calchek] certain parties
within the mikkei combine

04:38.946 --> 04:40.479
Think you set them up.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.347
[one]
we set them up?

04:42.349 --> 04:43.949
They came to us with that job!

04:43.951 --> 04:45.651
[calchek] which is why
it's always important

04:45.653 --> 04:47.803
To go through proper channels.

04:47.804 --> 04:49.954
[one] yeah, really sorry you dit
earn your commission on that on.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.791
[calchek] it's a small
price to pay for peace of mind.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.494
Okay, let me run
this scenario by you.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.763
Traugott's been doing
r&d on a white hole bomb.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.898
They've got a prototype
but they can't test it

04:59.900 --> 05:01.867
Without getting
the g.A.S onto their backs.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.419
So what do they do?

05:03.420 --> 05:04.970
They float word around about it,
back-channel whispers,

05:04.972 --> 05:06.672
And guess who takes the bait?

05:06.674 --> 05:08.023
Mikkei.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.373
They hired us to steal it.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.977
We do, deliver it, and once
it's safely into their hands,

05:11.979 --> 05:12.978
Traugott triggers the device

05:12.980 --> 05:14.980
And mikkei gets to take the fal.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.448
Does that sound about right?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.016
Huh, sounds about exactly right.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.718
Of course there's the question f

05:19.720 --> 05:21.019
Whether you were
playing both sides.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.321
[three sighs]
come on.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.622
[one] everyone knows
we've been untouchable

05:23.624 --> 05:24.923
Since our fallout with ferrous.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.692
[calchek]
well, things change.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.460
See, ferrous corp reached out te

05:28.462 --> 05:32.030
To reach out to you about a job.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.521
Why us?

05:33.522 --> 05:35.011
[calchek] because they
know you're the best.

05:35.012 --> 05:36.501
And also because you have
burned so many bridges

05:36.503 --> 05:38.637
That you are out of options.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.772
You either take this job and
make nice with ferrous corp,

05:40.774 --> 05:43.075
Which, by the way,
would be a very smart move

05:43.077 --> 05:45.811
While we wait for this
mikkei situation to shake out,

05:45.813 --> 05:47.579
Or you are really on your own.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.881
Look, this time around you
don't have to steal anything.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.616
In fact, you'll be
saving someone,

05:51.618 --> 05:52.617
Its a nice change of pace.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.553
[one]
who?

05:54.554 --> 05:56.488
[calchek] a ferrous corp scientt
was kidnapped about a month ago

05:56.490 --> 05:58.190
By a rival combine.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.891
He's being held in a lab
on some backwater planet.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.093
Very little in
the way of security.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.861
So it's a simple
snatch and grab.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.029
You're in. You're out.
It's a piece of cake.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.464
[three]
i hate cake.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.032
[one]
so we get into ferrous' good bos

06:07.034 --> 06:09.501
By getting in this other
rival corp's bad books?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.604
[calchek] yes, you want
ferrous corp to be your friend.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.538
[two]
we'll do it.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.608

what?

06:16.610 --> 06:17.642
[one]
shouldn't we talk about this?

[two]
no. We'll do it.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.945
[calchek] excellent. I will
send you the coordinates and,

06:20.948 --> 06:23.715
Uh good to be back
in business with you.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.936
Are you sure?

06:26.937 --> 06:28.754
The only thing i'm sure
about right now is that

06:28.756 --> 06:30.789
We need all
the friends we can get.

If every part of me was

are my thoughts my own,

12:23.744 --> 12:26.411
But i have no problem
hurting either of you--

12:26.413 --> 12:29.447
Or your friends
back on the shuttle.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.284
Your progress was monitored
from ship to surface.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.487
We've been expecting you.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.489
[one]
tabor set us up.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.808
[three]
that little prick.

12:39.809 --> 12:42.126
[man] now, if you will kindly
lay down your weapons,

12:42.129 --> 12:43.862
We have much to discuss.

12:43.864 --> 12:51.035
¶

12:51.037 --> 12:54.439
[four]
anger is counter-productive.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.508
It's a natural response,
but after a certain point,

12:56.510 --> 12:59.144
It becomes toxic.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.513
[six] i assume
you're talking about me?

13:01.515 --> 13:04.549
No, i was actually referring
to the passive-aggressive

13:04.551 --> 13:07.318
Empty seat next to you.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.220
You can resent us
all you like

13:09.222 --> 13:11.055
For our decision to
deliver the device,

13:11.057 --> 13:14.559
But ultimately you're as much
at fault as the rest of us.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.828
[six]
i tried to stop you.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.264
[four]
did you?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.067
[one]
marauder, do you read?

13:23.069 --> 13:24.235
[six]
go ahead, ground team.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.370
What's your status?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.404
[one]
it's complicated.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.607
[six]
care to elaborate?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.809
[one] well, it looks like
we've been invited to dinner.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.880
[six]
raza, this is the marauder.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.115
Are you there?

13:37.117 --> 13:37.949
[android]
yes.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.384
Is everything alright?

13:39.386 --> 13:40.451
[six]
negative.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.452
It was a set-up.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.505
The ground team
has been taken

13:43.506 --> 13:45.557
And we're told the facility
has a lock on our position.

13:45.559 --> 13:48.259
If we attempt to fly out,
they'll take us out.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.527
[android]
what should i do?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.862
[six]
just sit tight for now.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.597
We're gonna go
join the others.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.100
If you don't hear from us
inside the next 4 hours,

13:56.102 --> 13:58.503
Get the hell out of here.

13:58.505 --> 14:05.143
¶

14:05.145 --> 14:07.011
[man]
i am so sorry that i'm late.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.614
It's just been
one of those days.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.116
I'm sure you
can empathize.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.852
[one]
where is she?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.854
[man]
she is resting comfortably.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.455
I meant what i said earlier.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.624
I will never hurt her.

14:19.626 --> 14:24.629
In fact, this is my small way
of thanking you

14:24.631 --> 14:28.366
For keeping her safe
and returning her to me.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.001
[three]
who the hell are you?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.636
[rook]
my name is alexander rook.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.072
I own a company called
dwarf star technologies

14:34.074 --> 14:36.341
Along with all of its
subsidiaries, patents,

14:36.343 --> 14:39.177
And prototypes,
including rebecca,

14:39.179 --> 14:44.482
Although, i believe in your
company she is going by portia?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.551
[six] i'm pretty sure
you can't lay legal claim

14:46.553 --> 14:48.519
To the results
of banned research.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.655
Last time i checked,
the creation of human facsimiles

14:50.657 --> 14:52.190
Is against the law.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.259
Oh and what would
you have me do?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.561
Put one of those
ridiculous tattoos on her neck

14:56.563 --> 14:58.529
As if she was some
common android?

14:58.531 --> 14:59.964
[rook laughs]

14:59.966 --> 15:01.633
No.

15:03.536 --> 15:07.906
Although rebecca's biological
components are superior,

15:07.908 --> 15:12.410
She must be constantly monitored
and maintained by her nanites.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.614
Slow down the nanites,
slow down rebecca.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.250
Is that what you did to her?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.919
Yes.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.422
I have blanketed this entire
facility in a dampening field.

15:24.424 --> 15:29.327
At its present lowest setting,
it merely renders her harmless.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.562
But at higher settings,
it will shut her down,

15:31.564 --> 15:34.632
And ultimately destroy her.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.635
We can't have her
escaping a second time.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.672
You know, she was created
right here in this facility.

15:40.674 --> 15:43.041
She has no memory of it
because her consciousness

15:43.043 --> 15:45.176
Was inert at that point.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.145
She was moved
to a more appropriate,

15:47.147 --> 15:49.147
Secure facility
for her awakening.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.650
[three] yeah,
how'd that work out?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.652
Not particularly well
for the program,

15:54.654 --> 15:59.157
Or for the 43 scientists
and security personnel

15:59.159 --> 16:02.060
Who lost their lives
when she made her escape.

16:02.062 --> 16:06.364
We believe that there is
a flaw in her neural network

16:06.366 --> 16:10.335
That leaves her prone
to irrational behavior

16:10.337 --> 16:14.439
And outbursts of
extreme violence.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.975
Listen, you are very lucky.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.678
It was only a matter of time
before she turned on you too.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.213
[one]
so you say.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.615
[rook smirks]

16:24.617 --> 16:29.053
[rook] if i actually
considered any of you a threat,

16:29.055 --> 16:30.621
You would
already be dead.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.560
Now, come! Eat!

16:35.562 --> 16:45.670
¶

16:45.672 --> 16:55.747
¶

16:55.749 --> 16:57.515
[five]
you left her?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.785
[three]
didn't have a choice, kid.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.754
[six]
prepare to jump.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.690
[five]
you left her?!

17:18.338 --> 17:22.040
[scientist]
they're gone.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.541
[rook]
good.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.746
Let's get to work.

17:28.748 --> 17:43.061
¶

17:43.063 --> 17:44.762
[android] i've dropped
us out in close proximity

17:44.764 --> 17:47.832
To the system's a-type
main sequence star.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.168
As long as we remain
within it's radiation shadow,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.537
We'll be undetectable
by long-range scanners.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.073
[one]
but it's safe, right?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.841
[android]
absolutely not.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.608
If you're going to come up
with a plan of action,

17:58.611 --> 18:00.611
I suggest you do it quickly.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.318
[rook]
hello, rebecca.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.154
[two pants]

18:10.156 --> 18:13.157
Who the hell are you
and what did you do to me?

18:13.159 --> 18:15.326
And why do you keep
calling me rebecca?

18:15.328 --> 18:17.428
Because that's your name.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.629
And you are?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.332
It's alex.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.468
You-you really
don't remember me?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.637
No, i don't.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.141
Where's my crew?

18:30.143 --> 18:33.277
They're gone.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.745
What do you mean they're gone?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.764
I mean they left.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.782
They got in their shuttle,
flew back to their ship,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.785
And they jumped.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.687
No.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.156
They wouldn't just leave me.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.658
They didn't have a choice.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.428
For the moment,
at least, neither do you.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.801
Open this door.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.835
Come, sit down.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.754
Let's talk.

18:59.755 --> 19:01.672
Open this door or
i'm going to come over there

19:01.674 --> 19:03.374
And break you in half.

19:03.376 --> 19:07.612
Your people-breaking days
are over, at least for now.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.588
I'm sorry, but you
are no longer special.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.924
And as long as this
dampening field is active,

19:19.926 --> 19:22.393
You're less than normal.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.863
I am so sorry, but i can't
have you running off again.

19:25.865 --> 19:30.168
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:30.170 --> 19:34.238
What is the last thing you
remember about your past?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.641
Waking up out
of stasis on a ship.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.910
That's it.

19:38.912 --> 19:42.914
Those people you came with,
they did something to you.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.782
No, those people
are my friends,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.918
And they'll be coming back for .

19:46.920 --> 19:49.320
I don't think so.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.789
But if they are stupid enough t,

19:51.791 --> 19:53.724
We'll be ready for them.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.398
[three] i say we just do what
we do best: We head down there,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
We kill everyone,
and we bring her back.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.468
[one] as much as i admire
your suicidal optimism,

20:04.470 --> 20:07.471
There's no way of knowing
how many men or guns they have.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.740
[three] fine. So we'll lob
a couple of orbital strikes

20:09.742 --> 20:11.509
Their way first to soften 'em u.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.511
[four] a ship to surface
bombardment would be inadvisable

20:13.513 --> 20:15.780
Unless we knew exactly
where she was being held.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.248
[six]
besides, they'd see us coming

20:17.250 --> 20:19.217
And if they have
anti-satellite capabilities,

20:19.219 --> 20:22.353
They'd tag us before we
even got off our first salvo.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.789
[one] okay, how about
taking the marauder in?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.557
It's smaller, easier
to avoid detection.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.893
We can hit them with
a couple of precision strikes.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.261
And then what?

20:30.262 --> 20:31.628
And then land
and storm the place.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.664
But at that point we've
lost the element of surprise.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.550
[three sighs]

20:35.551 --> 20:37.435
They'll cut us to pieces
before we get anywhere near tha,

20:37.437 --> 20:38.970
If we made it that far.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.572
The second we land, our shuttle
becomes a stationary target.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.574
[android]
then don't land.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.109
Come again?

20:45.110 --> 20:46.643
[android] take the marauder,
but don't land.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.513
There's another way
into that facility.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.919
¶

20:54.921 --> 20:57.288
[door ringing]

20:57.290 --> 20:58.723
[five]
uh, hang on.

21:05.865 --> 21:06.897
Come in.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.534
[door opens]

21:10.536 --> 21:11.969
[six]
hey.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.973
Uh, just wanted you to know,
we're gonna go get her.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.310
I knew you weren't serious
about leaving her behind.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.845
The android's
coming with us,

21:20.847 --> 21:23.347
Which means someone has
to stay to monitor the ship.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.849
You just don't
want me there

21:24.851 --> 21:26.917
Because you don't
think i'd be any use.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.721
I don't want you there because
two wouldn't want you there.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.658
The android is gonna enter
a program into the nav system.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.693
If we're not back
inside of 4 hours,

21:35.695 --> 21:38.562
It'll set an automatic course
for the nearest space station.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.731
You'll be on your own.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.304
This is unwise.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.040
You're abandoning
your obligations to the ship.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.709
I'm fulfilling my duties
to the members of its crew

21:51.711 --> 21:54.045
By helping to
ensure their safety.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.714
My actions will in no way
compromise this vessel.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.350
They will indirectly,
if you don't return.

22:03.556 --> 22:07.024
I have every
intention of doing so.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.061
After careful consideration,
i've come to the conclusion

22:10.063 --> 22:13.564
That the benefits
of retrieval outweigh the risks.

22:13.566 --> 22:17.601
Two is integral to the security
of this ship and its crew.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.104
She is system-proficient,
a capable leader,

22:20.106 --> 22:24.075
And... She is my friend.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.378
Friendship implies
a mutual affection.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.348
You're not programmed to
form emotional attachments.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.817
Furthermore, the assumption
that she would reciprocate--

22:32.819 --> 22:36.087
The crew has demonstrated
a concern for my well-being,

22:36.089 --> 22:39.123
Sometimes at the risk
of their own lives.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.459
They engage me as an equal.

22:41.461 --> 22:45.830
They are... Nice to me.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.766
Humans have an innate tendency
to anthropomorphize.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.534
The fact that you
possess human features

22:50.536 --> 22:54.372
No doubt engenders
a subconscious confusion.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.040
Might i remind you?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.808
You are a machine.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.518
A machine with friends.

23:07.520 --> 23:21.031
¶

23:21.033 --> 23:24.068
[two] back on the ship,
i knew i was different.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.537
I just didn't know how.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.872
Even after i found out,

23:27.874 --> 23:29.940
It was just too
unbelievable to comprehend.

23:29.942 --> 23:33.544
But now, seeing all of this i...

23:34.414 --> 23:38.816
[rook] you should be
proud of what you are.

23:38.818 --> 23:44.455
Your body can overcome any
abnormal biological pathogen.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.490
You can regenerate.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.593
You are faster and stronger.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.763
You are superior in every way.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.966
So my nanites can
cure me and protect me,

23:55.968 --> 24:00.471
But they don't
prevent me from aging?

24:00.473 --> 24:02.039
No.

hate you for it.

found out about you,
