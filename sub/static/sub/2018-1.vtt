<i>What if this was your house?</i>
<i>Power's out. Lights are dead.</i>

03:36.762 --> 03:38.923
<i>Your little ones in their bunk bed</i>
<i>down the hall, crying out...</i>

03:38.998 --> 03:41.607
Mommy! Daddy!
Come quick! I'm scared!

03:41.707 --> 03:43.561
<i>- You need to get there, and fast.</i>
- Coming, honey! Daddy's coming!

03:43.636 --> 03:46.104
<i>You'll need a weapon.</i>
<i>But first, you'll need a flashlight.</i>

03:46.439 --> 03:48.134
<i>But you're in the dark!</i>
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

03:48.241 --> 03:50.175
<i>How are you gonna find it?</i>
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

03:50.276 --> 03:51.971
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

03:52.778 --> 03:55.679
That's right, folks!
I'm Larry Daley of Daley Devices,

03:55.815 --> 03:57.976
and we're gonna spend
the next paid-programing block

03:58.084 --> 03:59.346
rocking your world.

03:59.452 --> 04:03.354
And I brought along a friend to do it.
George Foreman, ladies and gentlemen!

04:04.790 --> 04:08.248
Fantastic, Larry, fantastic!
Isn't he fantastic, America?

04:13.466 --> 04:16.663
But, seriously, isn't it true
that just two years ago,

04:16.769 --> 04:19.363
you were working as a night guard
at some dusty museum?

04:19.471 --> 04:22.202
That is true, two-time world
heavyweight champ George Foreman.

04:22.975 --> 04:26.502
I was just a regular Joe
with a flashlight and a dream.

04:26.579 --> 04:28.604
You mean a regular Larry.

04:36.989 --> 04:41.289
But what's no joke is
you're CEO of Daley Devices,

04:41.360 --> 04:46.127
creator of such indispensable items
as the Super Big Dog Bone!

04:47.733 --> 04:50.258
- You like that one?
- The Unlosable Key Ring!

04:50.336 --> 04:51.963
Oh, yeah, that little chestnut!

04:52.038 --> 04:56.099
And now your latest breakthrough...
Say it with me, America!

04:56.175 --> 04:58.939
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

05:01.981 --> 05:04.415
Whatever the household crisis,
this is Daley Devices. Can I help you?

05:04.483 --> 05:06.951
Tina, give this back to Stewart.
I don't trust his math, okay?

05:07.019 --> 05:08.611
- That guy called again.
- Again?

05:08.688 --> 05:12.681
Lar! Huge news!
We got the Wal-Mart meeting.

05:13.226 --> 05:15.387
- No! When?
- Yeah. Three days.

05:15.962 --> 05:17.554
Okay, all right.
We got a lot of work to do.

05:17.697 --> 05:20.962
Well, okay, did you just hear me
say "Wal" and "Mart" together?

05:21.167 --> 05:22.532
Yeah! I know, it's huge.

05:22.668 --> 05:24.636
So just take a second
to be happy about it.

05:24.704 --> 05:26.069
All right.

05:26.505 --> 05:27.870
You're totally making fun of me.

05:27.974 --> 05:30.135
No, let's hold off on the victory parade
till we close, okay?

05:30.443 --> 05:31.910
You got it.

05:32.311 --> 05:34.745
- And when does he want to meet?
- They want Friday morning, 10:00 a.m.

05:34.847 --> 05:36.576
Okay, then, you know what?
Cancel that pitch

05:36.649 --> 05:38.844
for the electric saw thing
with the propeller, all right?

05:38.918 --> 05:40.249
- I just want to focus on this.
- Okay.

05:40.353 --> 05:42.048
- Just this.
- My daughter's birthday, canceled!

05:55.768 --> 05:57.497
You can go home.
I'm gonna be pretty late, okay.

05:57.570 --> 05:59.162
Okay, boss.

06:13.586 --> 06:16.749
Hello! Excuse me!
Unauthorized personnel!

06:17.423 --> 06:20.551
If it isn't our very own
Mr. Success Story.

06:20.660 --> 06:23.595
Come for one of your nostalgia tours?
I haven't seen you for a few months.

06:23.996 --> 06:27.659
Yeah, I've been busy.
What's going on here?

06:28.034 --> 06:30.832
Progress, so they tell me.

06:31.337 --> 06:37.276
The future.
Behold, Natural History, version 2.0.

06:43.649 --> 06:46.982
<i>Welcome to The Museum of Natural</i>
<i>History, where history comes to life!</i>

06:47.086 --> 06:48.883
<i>Step up, ask your question.</i>

06:48.988 --> 06:51.388
<i>Then let the next little boy or girl</i>
<i>have their turn.</i>

06:53.526 --> 06:56.427
Okay, where were you born?

06:56.829 --> 06:58.854
<i>Right here in New York City,</i>
<i>on Twentieth Street.</i>

06:58.998 --> 07:02.434
<i>October 27th,</i>
<i>the year of our Lord 1858.</i>

07:04.904 --> 07:08.567
Blah, blah, blah.
History, history. Learning, learning.

07:08.874 --> 07:10.865
Changing America, one child at a time.

07:11.911 --> 07:15.210
That's great. So you're adding
some new interactive exhibits?

07:15.581 --> 07:19.176
No, Mr. Daley, not adding.
Replacing the old exhibits.

07:19.685 --> 07:21.846
- Where are they going?
- Away.

07:21.921 --> 07:24.719
We're getting rid of all this junk.
The dioramas, the waxworks,

07:24.790 --> 07:28.521
even some of the shabbier animals,
like this scrawny little monkey.

07:29.061 --> 07:31.393
You should be careful. He's a capuchin.

07:31.864 --> 07:33.354
It's a monkey.

07:33.432 --> 07:36.367
He's a rare breed. He's a capuchin.
He's not just a monkey.

07:37.203 --> 07:39.671
"Monkey", then. I said "monkey".
Why be specific?

07:39.739 --> 07:41.900
When you're throwing away a monkey,
you don't need the Latin name.

07:42.108 --> 07:43.541
Are you throwing him away
or are you moving him?

07:43.843 --> 07:47.836
What are you, the Primate
Garbage Police? Let it go, baby.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.239
- Whose idea was this?
- Me, of course.

07:50.349 --> 07:52.180
I'm in charge. Me and the board.

07:52.385 --> 07:53.647
Mainly the board.

07:53.719 --> 07:55.949
Anyway, why do you care?

07:56.622 --> 07:58.954
No, it's just that people
love this stuff.

07:59.358 --> 08:02.088
People, Mr. Daley, love "What's next?"

08:02.962 --> 08:04.554
You should know that. You left.

08:04.630 --> 08:06.655
My situation changed.
My business took off...

08:06.732 --> 08:09.394
Yeah, you became a success.
So would I, if I was a night guard.

08:09.769 --> 08:11.703
So where are these guys going?

08:12.405 --> 08:15.272
Deep storage. Federal Archives.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.373
- Where's that?
- Washington, D.C.

08:19.111 --> 08:20.476
The Smithsonian.

08:20.813 --> 08:22.212
There's got to be something
that we can do.

08:22.281 --> 08:28.151
It's done!
They leave tomorrow morning. It's over.

09:05.291 --> 09:08.886
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
How you doing with all this?

09:09.762 --> 09:11.593
You want what's in here?

09:11.664 --> 09:15.566
You think I got something for you?
You think I got a little rope?

09:15.634 --> 09:17.431
Think you're stronger than me, huh?

09:18.604 --> 09:20.094
Is that all you got, huh?

09:37.490 --> 09:40.755
Lawrence! Good to see you, lad!

09:40.826 --> 09:42.293
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

09:42.595 --> 09:44.426
The Guardian of Brooklyn has returned!

09:44.763 --> 09:47.732
Hey, Ahk. Look, McPhee told me
what's going on around here.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.199
- I had no idea.
- Indeed.

09:49.268 --> 09:53.068
A lot has transpired, Lawrence, since
your last visit. One would say that...

09:54.640 --> 09:56.505
- Just...
- Cricket.

09:57.510 --> 10:01.310
Hey, Bocephus! Little help over here!

10:03.782 --> 10:05.249
Hey.

10:06.352 --> 10:09.014
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

10:09.722 --> 10:11.622
Well, lookee here.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.181
If it ain't
Mr. Big-in-the-Britches himself,

10:14.260 --> 10:16.660
come back just in time to see us off!

10:16.729 --> 10:19.163
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look,
I don't even know how this happened.

10:20.332 --> 10:23.859
Yeah. Yeah, real mystery
how this happened.

10:23.969 --> 10:27.405
Maybe the answer's on that magic
buzzing box there in your hand!

10:27.840 --> 10:30.741
You weren't here, Gigantor!
That's how it happened!

10:30.809 --> 10:32.140
Ain't no mystery!

10:32.645 --> 10:35.170
The fact is, Larry, there's no one else
here to speak on our behalf

10:35.247 --> 10:36.475
during business hours.

10:36.549 --> 10:38.847
None, none, dum-dum.

10:41.186 --> 10:43.484
Hey, guys! It's okay!

10:43.556 --> 10:45.956
I'll call the board in the morning,
all right? I got some pull now.

10:46.025 --> 10:47.959
I'll handle this.
We're gonna be okay here.

10:48.027 --> 10:50.393
"We"? Did you hear that?
You hear Daydream Johnny?

10:50.896 --> 10:54.354
There ain't been a "we" ever since
you put us on the "pay no mind" list.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.731
And that's a cold place to be, boy.

10:56.835 --> 10:59.030
Larry, what's done is done.

11:00.906 --> 11:03.841
Even the glory of Rome
had to come to an end.

11:05.444 --> 11:08.174
Would you please not look dramatically
off into the middle distance

11:08.247 --> 11:09.839
when you say that?
It makes me feel worse.

11:10.282 --> 11:12.011
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:12.718 --> 11:15.209
Where are you looking?
Where are you looking? I'm over here.

11:17.022 --> 11:19.752
Just a bit of wall.

11:19.925 --> 11:21.517
Look, guys, maybe it won't be so bad.

11:23.429 --> 11:24.623
Yes, you make a good point.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.961
But this is the Smithsonian
we're talking about here.

11:27.933 --> 11:29.525
Dexter, you don't know that.

11:30.402 --> 11:34.270
You're missing the point, Gigantor!
They're shipping us out!

11:34.573 --> 11:36.700
Larry, I know you're trying
to make us feel better.

11:37.042 --> 11:39.670
I can see that you're genuinely
slightly bothered,

11:40.179 --> 11:41.840
but it's never going to be the same.

11:42.014 --> 11:44.448
All of us here, together,
in this place.

11:44.550 --> 11:47.018
It ain't never gonna be home, boy.

11:48.854 --> 11:53.553
Jedediah, please! Lawrence, these
are emotional times for all of us.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.454
But it is our last night as a family,

11:57.029 --> 11:59.361
and I don't want to see it squandered
in self-pity.

12:00.132 --> 12:05.160
So who will join me for one final stroll
through these hallowed halls?

12:07.906 --> 12:09.806
- Do you want to go for a walk?
- No.

12:10.275 --> 12:13.369
I'm just gonna
squander it in self-pity.

12:13.879 --> 12:15.540
My dear, shall we?

12:44.343 --> 12:45.901
Safe journey, my love.

12:49.615 --> 12:51.810
Hey, Dexter, want some help there?

12:56.422 --> 12:58.822
Hey, come on, man.
No hard feelings, all right?

12:59.291 --> 13:00.758
It's gonna be fine.

13:03.762 --> 13:05.093
It's almost dawn, Lawrence.

13:06.365 --> 13:09.823
Yeah. So, where's your crate, Teddy?

13:09.935 --> 13:11.766
I won't be making this journey,
Lawrence.

13:11.837 --> 13:15.500
It seems myself, Rexy,
and a few of the signature exhibits

13:15.607 --> 13:18.167
will be staying here for now.

13:19.044 --> 13:20.477
Without the tablet?

13:22.548 --> 13:24.175
In truth, Lawrence,

13:28.353 --> 13:31.288
Ahkmenrah's tablet
will be remaining here with him.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.050
What?

13:34.159 --> 13:36.855
They're going without
the tablet, my friend.

13:36.962 --> 13:39.362
I'm afraid this night is their last.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.228
You didn't tell them.

13:43.335 --> 13:47.465
Sometimes it's more noble to tell a
small lie than deliver a painful truth.

14:02.421 --> 14:05.879
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I shall do my best.

14:08.227 --> 14:09.819
And who knows?

14:10.395 --> 14:13.762
Sometimes the greatest change
brings about even greater opportunity.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.359
Look at you, Lawrence.

14:15.434 --> 14:19.165
You left this place
and created quite a life for yourself.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.598
Yeah, I guess so.

14:24.009 --> 14:26.204
I should hope
you'd do more than guess, my friend.

14:26.278 --> 14:29.770
You're a captain of industry.
The world at your fingertips.

14:29.848 --> 14:31.440
It seems to me
you have everything you wanted.

14:32.117 --> 14:33.675
Yeah, no, I know.

14:34.286 --> 14:37.278
No, you don't. If I may, lad,

14:37.890 --> 14:40.381
allow me to offer you
one piece of advice.

14:41.059 --> 14:44.927
The key to happiness,
to true happiness, is...

14:46.732 --> 14:48.927
Hang on one sec. I just gotta...

14:49.968 --> 14:52.198
I got this Japanese deal.

14:54.273 --> 14:56.605
No, okay, I'm turning this off.
I'm sorry.

14:57.242 --> 14:58.766
The key to happiness?

15:10.055 --> 15:11.613
I'll see you, Teddy.

15:38.984 --> 15:41.316
So they're gone?
There's nothing you can do?

15:41.420 --> 15:43.650
I wish there was, man.
I'm telling you, I tried everything.

15:43.755 --> 15:48.192
I talked to McPhee, I called the board,
but they shipped them out this morning.

15:48.293 --> 15:49.817
This is a lot of food, Dad.

15:49.928 --> 15:52.522
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna come by.
I thought I told you.

15:52.631 --> 15:54.792
We just have to go over
a couple of little work things.

15:54.867 --> 15:58.200
- So you're working tonight.
- I used to work every night, remember?

15:58.804 --> 16:00.931
That was when you had
the coolest job in the world.

16:01.173 --> 16:04.540
Yeah, well, "cool" doesn't pay
for your <i>Guitar God VI</i> or whatever.

16:04.977 --> 16:07.946
- Hello?
<i>- Gigantor! It's me, Jedediah!</i>

16:08.013 --> 16:10.504
<i>- Hold! Hold!</i>
- Jed?

16:10.616 --> 16:11.981
<i>Never surrender!</i>

16:12.050 --> 16:14.382
Jed, what are you...
How did you dial the phone?

16:14.486 --> 16:16.954
Long story! That brazen little monkey
stole the tablet,

16:17.022 --> 16:19.149
and now we're in a world of hurt, boy!

16:19.224 --> 16:21.385
- What's going on?
- Kahmunrah!

16:21.526 --> 16:24.359
- Kahmunrah?
- Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

16:24.463 --> 16:26.522
- And trust me, not a friendly!
- Never!

16:26.632 --> 16:28.327
I repeat, not a friendly!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.368
- Is that Attila, Jed?
<i>- I don't know how much longer</i>

16:30.469 --> 16:31.868
<i>- we can fight them off! No!</i>
- Jed? Are you okay?

16:31.970 --> 16:33.369
<i>- Let go of me! Help!</i>
- Hey, Jed.

16:33.472 --> 16:35.406
<i>- Let go! No, you let go of me! Help!</i>
- Jed?

16:37.676 --> 16:39.200
What was that about?

16:44.216 --> 16:45.808
I don't know.

16:46.885 --> 16:49.183
Here, come on.
Gonna drop you off at your mom's.

16:49.254 --> 16:51.916
- What's going on, Dad?
- I'm gonna go find out.

16:53.425 --> 16:56.724
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the
Federal Archives are in the Smithsonian.

16:56.828 --> 16:58.261
Where exactly am I going?

16:58.363 --> 17:02.561
That's the thing, Dad. The Smithsonian
is actually 19 different museums.

17:02.668 --> 17:04.363
They're laid out
around the National Mall,

17:04.435 --> 17:07.064
from the Capitol
to the Lincoln Memorial.

17:07.172 --> 17:10.266
They got everything there.
There's actually some really cool stuff.

17:10.375 --> 17:13.571
Nicky, please focus.
Which museum are the Archives in?

17:13.679 --> 17:17.240
Not in, under. It looks like it runs
underneath the entire Smithsonian.

17:17.616 --> 17:19.550
So if Ahkmenrah's tablet is
down there...

17:19.617 --> 17:22.108
The biggest museum in the world
is coming alive.

17:22.454 --> 17:23.853
<i>What is exactly is your plan here, Dad?</i>

17:23.922 --> 17:26.253
- Don't worry about it.
- You have no plan, do you?

17:26.590 --> 17:29.560
Now, Nicholas, I have a very good,
highly thought-out plan.

17:29.795 --> 17:32.025
- You have no plan.
- Yes, I have no plan.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.462
I'll call you when I'm in.

17:42.307 --> 17:44.104
Here you go. Thanks.

18:00.759 --> 18:03.421
Welcome to the biggest museum
in the world.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.463
I know, right? It's a trip.

18:05.564 --> 18:08.658
How about these planes dangling
from the ceilings, huh? Pretty weird.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.463
Hi, excuse me. Could you tell me
how to get to the Federal Archives?

18:11.570 --> 18:15.734
Of course. Just be a historical document
worthy of storing for all eternity.

18:17.409 --> 18:19.138
I'm kidding. He's not a document.

18:19.678 --> 18:23.512
I'm sorry, sir, the Archives are
underground, and they're a secure area.

18:24.082 --> 18:27.279
Really? Like, totally secure?
Okay, thank you.

19:09.728 --> 19:13.994
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the museum will be closing in one hour.</i>

19:57.075 --> 19:58.406
Kahmunrah.

20:06.051 --> 20:09.316
Hey! What are you doing?

20:10.589 --> 20:12.853
- No touching.
- No, I wasn't gonna touch it.

20:12.924 --> 20:14.915
You're moving in with some I.T.T., bro.

20:15.026 --> 20:17.153
- I.T. T?
- That's "Intent to Touch", homey.

20:17.996 --> 20:19.327
No, I wasn't.
You're not allowed to go over the...

20:19.397 --> 20:21.763
- What, are you gonna kiss it?
- All right, sorry.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.062
Put your hand on it and touch it.
'Cause I stand there

20:24.169 --> 20:26.831
and I wait all day
for a little girl like you to come in

20:26.905 --> 20:30.033
and put her precious nail-polished nails
all over the exhibits.

20:30.108 --> 20:32.906
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought
we lived in a free country, so...

20:33.011 --> 20:34.069
- No, we don't.
- No?

20:34.179 --> 20:36.545
It's the United States of Don't Touch
That Thing Right in Front of You.

20:36.615 --> 20:38.242
I just want to...
I'm allowed to look at it here, okay?

20:38.350 --> 20:39.749
See what happens when you touch it!

20:39.851 --> 20:42.115
So you're threatening me?
You're threatening me, Brandon?

20:42.220 --> 20:44.120
- It's "Brundon."
- Excuse me?

20:44.222 --> 20:45.689
- "Brundon"!
- "Brundon"?

20:46.024 --> 20:47.457
- "Brundon."
- "Brundon."

20:47.559 --> 20:50.221
What, did they run out of U's
on your nameplate maker?

20:50.295 --> 20:51.626
I don't know, did they run out of jokes

20:51.730 --> 20:53.561
at the interesting-joke store
that you shop at?

20:53.632 --> 20:55.862
Sorry, it looks like "Brandon", but...

20:55.934 --> 20:57.925
I'm not here to be your
speech therapist. It's "Brundon"!

20:58.036 --> 20:59.628
- "Brundon." Okay...
- You never heard of the name before?

20:59.738 --> 21:01.035
"Brundon"? No.

21:01.106 --> 21:04.405
Look up most popular baby names
in 1984. "Brundon."

21:04.476 --> 21:07.104
Okay. Are you threatening me, Brundon?

21:07.746 --> 21:09.543
I don't know, Princess Jasmine. Am I?

21:10.248 --> 21:12.079
- Oh, wow. Lunabeam nine-volt.
- Yeah.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.447
Wonderful piece of hardware, huh?

21:13.552 --> 21:15.247
- That's their title, Lunabeam Nine.
- Great.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.788
I prefer the Maglite LED myself,
but that's just me.

21:17.889 --> 21:19.789
- Do me a huge favor.
- What?

21:19.891 --> 21:23.884
Shove your hands into your pockets,
put your attitude way down,

21:23.962 --> 21:25.759
and, also, be nice to people.

21:26.598 --> 21:28.395
Great. But could I just ask you
one thing?

21:28.466 --> 21:30.229
- Yeah.
- Okay, so just to be clear,

21:30.302 --> 21:33.499
- so, I can't do this, right?
- Okay, that's actually crazy.

21:33.605 --> 21:35.300
Did you just make a decision
to possibly end your life

21:35.373 --> 21:36.397
earlier than you were expecting?

21:36.474 --> 21:37.771
I'm gonna hit you with the flashlight.

21:37.842 --> 21:39.833
- Now you are threatening me. Okay.
- Do not touch it!

21:39.945 --> 21:41.503
- Don't touch me.
- Do not touch it!

21:41.613 --> 21:42.910
- Do not touch it!
- Don't touch me!

21:42.981 --> 21:44.278
I'll touch you with my flashlight
all day.

21:44.349 --> 21:45.907
No, your flashlight
is meant to illuminate.

21:45.984 --> 21:48.475
I will literally rent a camper,

21:48.587 --> 21:51.078
and we will drive across America
with my flashlight on your chest.

21:51.156 --> 21:53.090
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

21:53.425 --> 21:54.824
Want to see what happens
when I do it one more time?

21:54.926 --> 21:56.860
- Let's see what happens.
- Watch you do nothing.

21:56.962 --> 21:58.759
Let's watch you do nothing
when I do this.

22:00.265 --> 22:01.926
Seriously, Brandon...

22:02.000 --> 22:04.195
- Brundon.
- Brundon,

22:04.302 --> 22:06.031
you do not know who you're dealing with.

22:06.137 --> 22:08.628
You think you know what it means
to be a guard, huh?

22:08.707 --> 22:10.834
Trust me, you don't know
the meaning of the word.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.974
I have seen things
that you could not imagine.

22:14.613 --> 22:16.843
- Like what kind of stuff?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

22:16.948 --> 22:18.677
- But you're gonna drop the flashlight...
- The way you said it,

22:18.783 --> 22:20.648
it sounded like you were gonna say
something cool.

22:20.719 --> 22:22.710
Yeah, well, you don't get to hear it.

22:22.821 --> 22:24.311
Drop the flashlight.

22:33.031 --> 22:34.464
We cool?

22:35.700 --> 22:37.065
That's actually pretty cool,
what you just did.

22:37.168 --> 22:38.499
Thank you.

22:38.570 --> 22:40.367
No hard feelings?

22:40.472 --> 22:43.168
- All right? Sorry.
- Okay.

22:43.241 --> 22:45.232
- I'm sorry.
- No, It's my fault. I shouldn't have...

22:45.343 --> 22:47.368
No. It takes two opposing forces
to cause friction, and...

22:47.479 --> 22:49.071
And you're just doing your job, all right.

22:49.648 --> 22:52.014
- Take it easy, man.
- Yeah!

22:53.551 --> 22:54.916
That guy's great.

23:40.598 --> 23:42.759
- Okay, buddy, I'm in.
- Great. Where are you?

23:42.967 --> 23:45.663
<i>The northeast corridor of the Castle,</i>
<i>just off the Commons.</i>

23:45.737 --> 23:47.932
- I need you to talk me to the Archives.
<i>- Okay.</i>

23:48.139 --> 23:49.731
At the end of the hall, turn right,

23:49.808 --> 23:51.742
and there should be a stairwell
coming up on your left.

23:52.410 --> 23:54.810
- Got it.
- Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

23:54.913 --> 23:57.609
Those underground tunnels
connect a bunch of different buildings.

23:57.716 --> 23:59.274
<i>- It could get complicated.</i>
- We'd better hurry,

23:59.384 --> 24:01.284
we only got 28 minutes till sundown.

24:01.386 --> 24:04.480
<i>When you get down to B level,</i>
<i>you want to take another left...</i>

24:04.589 --> 24:07.717
- Nick? Hello? Nick?
<i>- Dad! Can you hear...</i>

24:07.792 --> 24:09.225
Nick, you're... Nick!

24:35.153 --> 24:39.681
<i>- ID, Brundon.</i>
- Hey.

24:40.325 --> 24:42.793
<i>- Later, dude.</i>
- All right. Yeah.

24:52.203 --> 24:55.104
All right. Where are you guys?

26:27.398 --> 26:29.229
Oh, my God.

27:02.467 --> 27:05.334
You little troublemaker.
I'm gonna deal with you later.

27:44.676 --> 27:46.906
No. No! No, no, no!

28:05.496 --> 28:07.225
No, English. English, perhaps.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.099
I'm sorry, who are you?

28:10.401 --> 28:16.067
I am Kahmunrah,
the great king of the great kings,

28:16.174 --> 28:19.541
and from the darkest depths
of ancient history,

28:19.611 --> 28:23.513
I have come back to life!

28:27.418 --> 28:30.478
Perhaps you did not hear
what I just said.

28:30.555 --> 28:36.050
I am a centuries-old Egyptian Pharaoh.
I was dead,

28:36.127 --> 28:40.564
but now I have come back to life!

28:41.299 --> 28:44.268
Yeah, no. I heard that.
I got that. Welcome back.

28:47.772 --> 28:52.766
- Who are you?
- Larry Daley. Daley Devices?

28:52.877 --> 28:56.973
It's up in New York. It's funny,
I know your brother, Ahkmenrah.

28:57.081 --> 28:58.378
- Do you?
- Yeah.

28:58.449 --> 29:02.146
He knows baby brother.
The favorite son.

29:02.253 --> 29:04.744
- Yeah, good kid.
- Isn't he just?

29:05.123 --> 29:07.921
You know, Mother and Father always
gave him the best of everything,

29:07.992 --> 29:11.223
and I do mean everything.
They even gave him the throne.

29:11.763 --> 29:14.095
The throne which was rightfully mine!

29:14.966 --> 29:17.560
- He never mentioned that.
- I'll just bet he didn't.

29:17.635 --> 29:24.006
Well, now begins the era of Kahmunrah,
because I have come back to...

29:24.108 --> 29:25.973
Never mind, just hand me the tablet.

29:26.077 --> 29:28.272
- Don't give it to him, Gigantor!
- Keep him away!

29:28.346 --> 29:30.837
Silence! Silence in there, please!

29:31.649 --> 29:35.085
- Don't make me come in there!
- No! I won't be muzzled!

29:35.319 --> 29:38.379
Look, that tablet is more powerful

29:38.456 --> 29:42.950
than you, Larry Daley of Daley Devices,
can possibly imagine.

29:43.194 --> 29:47.130
Bringing things back to life
is just a parlor trick.

29:47.198 --> 29:50.429
With it, I shall unlock
the Gate to the Underworld

29:50.501 --> 29:54.130
and bring forth my army
from the Land of the Dead.

29:54.205 --> 29:57.140
So, if it's not too much trouble...

30:00.111 --> 30:02.045
...hand it over.

30:04.816 --> 30:06.181
Okay, here you go.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.277
Wise decision.

30:12.523 --> 30:15.287
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought
you wanted the Cube, but...

30:18.830 --> 30:20.320
The Cube?

30:21.566 --> 30:24.433
The Cube of Rubik.

30:27.238 --> 30:32.904
All right, what is
this Cube of Rubik, then?

30:33.010 --> 30:37.947
The Cube. You know, the one
that turns all who oppose you to dust?

30:38.549 --> 30:40.949
That one? Whatever. I thought...

30:41.052 --> 30:43.043
It was my bad, 'cause...
You know what? By the way,

30:43.121 --> 30:44.748
your brother didn't want
to mess with it, either.

30:44.856 --> 30:46.187
Yeah, he wanted to play it safe, too.

30:46.257 --> 30:49.283
Just, you sort of struck me
as a next-level sort of guy, so I was...

30:51.429 --> 30:53.761
I am not my brother, Larry.

30:54.365 --> 30:58.324
I will kill you and your friends
in the blink of an eye.

31:00.738 --> 31:04.037
Now take me to this Cube of Rubik.

31:06.577 --> 31:08.442
- Here it is.
- Open it.

31:37.942 --> 31:39.933
Come back here!
Come back here with my tablet!

31:40.011 --> 31:41.569
I still have your friends!

32:20.585 --> 32:22.576
- Take the wheel!
- What?

32:22.687 --> 32:26.179
I said, take the wheel! Oh, we're
in it now! I love it! I love it!

32:26.657 --> 32:28.318
Just keep her straight,
I'll handle the rest.

32:28.392 --> 32:30.417
Now, charge!

32:36.801 --> 32:41.329
- Okay, so what's the plan here?
- We're Americans! We don't plan, we do!

32:41.405 --> 32:43.168
Now hold on!

32:53.517 --> 32:58.147
See that? Act first, think later!
Works every time!

32:58.222 --> 32:59.587
You're in good hands!

32:59.724 --> 33:03.421
General George A. Custer
of the Fighting U.S. 7th Cavalry,

33:03.527 --> 33:05.154
at your service.

33:09.367 --> 33:11.892
I'm good, I'm good! Fly, you fool!

33:22.413 --> 33:23.778
What's the rumpus, ace?

33:23.881 --> 33:25.212
Look, lady, could you
get out of the way?

33:25.283 --> 33:27.877
Lady? Who are you calling lady?
The name is Amelia.

33:34.425 --> 33:36.950
Amelia Earhart!
Perhaps you've heard of me?

33:37.061 --> 33:39.825
Oh, right.
You're a famous pilot or whatever.

33:39.931 --> 33:42.627
Pilot? I was the first woman
to fly the Atlantic!

33:42.733 --> 33:44.325
First woman to receive the Flying Cross,

33:44.435 --> 33:47.427
first woman to fly across the 48 states
in a gyroprop.

33:47.505 --> 33:50.338
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent
look of alarm off your kisser,

33:50.441 --> 33:54.639
I was wondering if you might be so kind
as to tell me exactly where I am.

33:54.712 --> 33:57.112
You're in a museum.
Or, actually, under it.

33:57.181 --> 33:59.979
And I'm in kind of a dangerous
situation right now,

34:00.051 --> 34:02.519
so you might not want to be
anywhere near me.

34:05.022 --> 34:06.990
- Wow, you're fast.
- What's your name, flyboy?

34:07.692 --> 34:09.819
My name is Larry Daley.

34:10.328 --> 34:12.795
Well, Larry Daley,
in case you weren't listening,

34:12.862 --> 34:14.989
I'm not one to shy away from danger.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.824
How about spears?
Are you one to shy away from spears?

34:20.204 --> 34:23.696
Let's ankle, skipper!
Now we're gonna have some fun.

34:27.311 --> 34:31.475
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, bingo!

34:33.751 --> 34:35.342
Like a Golden Fleece.

34:36.253 --> 34:39.848
All right, troops,
when your enemies captured me,

34:39.924 --> 34:42.085
they made themselves
my enemies as well.

34:42.860 --> 34:45.556
Big mistake. Big mistake.

34:48.232 --> 34:50.359
All right, here's the plan.

34:51.202 --> 34:55.070
On the third bugle blast,
I shall loudly announce, "Attack!"

34:58.009 --> 35:03.276
At which point,
we will all jump out of this box

35:05.016 --> 35:06.574
and attack.

35:13.190 --> 35:17.058
Mind bomb. What do you think?

35:19.563 --> 35:22.054
You, Sacaja...

35:22.133 --> 35:23.361
That is not my name.

35:23.434 --> 35:25.459
- Sacajamea.
- No.

35:25.569 --> 35:27.799
- Sack-in-a-box.
- No.

35:27.905 --> 35:30.635
- Cinco de Mayo.
- I know you are a famous general...

35:30.741 --> 35:33.073
That's all right, that's all right.
I'm a person, just like you.

35:33.744 --> 35:36.304
But won't yelling, "Attack!"
alert the enemy

35:36.414 --> 35:37.904
that we are about to attack?

35:38.416 --> 35:39.747
What?

35:48.259 --> 35:50.159
Yeah, I guess so.

35:56.167 --> 35:58.032
You're quite the popular fellow,
Mr. Daley.

35:58.102 --> 35:59.592
Why don't you just skedaddle?

35:59.670 --> 36:01.638
I can't skedaddle.
My friends are being held down there.

36:01.739 --> 36:04.435
I got to go get them.
I got to find another way down.

36:15.519 --> 36:16.986
This is new.

36:23.327 --> 36:26.353
Hey, it's all right.
I don't want to hurt you.

36:29.133 --> 36:31.124
I don't think it's you
they're afraid of, Mr. Daley.

36:37.975 --> 36:39.875
Trade you. Thanks.

36:40.478 --> 36:43.811
Back off! Just back off!

36:45.015 --> 36:46.642
I will fork you!

36:46.984 --> 36:48.474
How about you, huh?

36:51.322 --> 36:53.017
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

36:53.124 --> 36:55.820
I spent two weeks spear-hunting
with a tribe in Micronesia.

36:57.728 --> 36:59.753
The Micronesians had
much slower reflexes.

37:03.501 --> 37:04.798
Come on!

37:09.440 --> 37:14.173
It's over! It's over! It's all over!

37:17.748 --> 37:20.444
Well, this is one humdinger
of a hootenanny.

37:27.091 --> 37:28.956
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

37:30.728 --> 37:33.026
Wow, four bars in 1945.

37:33.097 --> 37:34.621
- Hello?
<i>- Dad, finally!</i>

37:34.732 --> 37:36.359
I've been studying
these plans to the Archives.

37:36.634 --> 37:38.033
Looks like once
you get down the stairwell...

37:38.102 --> 37:40.070
Oh, I'm way past the stairwell, Nicky.

37:40.137 --> 37:42.264
- So you found everyone?
- Sort of.

37:42.373 --> 37:44.238
What is that flibberty-widget
you are talking to?

37:44.308 --> 37:46.276
- Who's that?
- It's Amelia Earhart.

37:46.377 --> 37:48.038
You found Amelia Earhart?

37:48.112 --> 37:49.272
I... Hey!

37:49.380 --> 37:53.248
- Wait a minute!
- Buddy, what's your hurry?

37:53.317 --> 37:56.548
- Didn't you hear? The war's over!
- Sorry. These guys are chasing me.

37:56.620 --> 37:59.453
What? What am I looking at, Mardi Gras?

37:59.557 --> 38:02.890
- What unit are you from?
- I'm from Brooklyn.

38:02.960 --> 38:07.260
What? Are you serious?
I'm from Flatbush! Hey, fellas!

38:07.398 --> 38:09.559
These so-and-so's are trying
to rough up my pal here

38:09.633 --> 38:10.964
just 'cause he's from Brooklyn!

38:11.068 --> 38:12.797
- Thank you!
- You got it! Fight!

38:15.239 --> 38:18.231
Hey, mister! You forgot your...

38:20.177 --> 38:21.508
What the heck is this thing?

38:30.754 --> 38:33.348
Excuse me. Mind if I get in here?

38:37.928 --> 38:39.828
Any time you're done, Mr. Daley.

38:41.031 --> 38:42.760
- Call me!
- Thank you for that.

38:42.833 --> 38:44.960
So you're quite the smooth operator,
aren't you, Mr. Daley?

38:45.369 --> 38:46.768
Quick!

38:54.445 --> 38:56.504
- That actually worked.
- What's next?

38:56.614 --> 38:59.048
Look, nothing personal, but I'm kind of
in the middle of something here

38:59.149 --> 39:00.639
that's not really your fight.

39:00.718 --> 39:02.447
It's because I'm a woman, isn't it?

39:02.653 --> 39:06.214
No, it's because I've got this ancient
raised-from-the-dead evil Pharaoh guy

39:06.323 --> 39:09.349
who's willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet

39:09.460 --> 39:10.688
so he can rule the world.

39:10.794 --> 39:12.819
So it is because I'm a woman!

39:12.896 --> 39:14.193
- Look, I...
- No, you look, Mr. Daley!

39:14.298 --> 39:16.698
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem!

39:16.800 --> 39:19.166
- Lost in what?
- Black and white photo, you boob!

39:19.236 --> 39:21.397
Now listen, and listen good.
I can help you.

39:21.505 --> 39:24.497
I want to help you, and not because
I like you, which so far I don't,

39:24.575 --> 39:28.170
but because I smell adventure,
and, damn it, I want in.

39:30.314 --> 39:32.748
Okay. Don't blame me
if something happens to you.

39:33.417 --> 39:34.816
I should be so lucky.

39:35.886 --> 39:40.380
I am Kahmunrah. I am half god,

39:40.758 --> 39:43.659
once removed on my mother's side,

39:43.727 --> 39:48.255
rightful ruler of Egypt,
future ruler of...

39:49.266 --> 39:50.824
Well, everything else.

39:50.934 --> 39:53.994
Now, I have lost some men.

39:54.605 --> 39:59.668
So, I am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan

39:59.743 --> 40:01.734
of conquering this world.

40:02.346 --> 40:04.007
Ivan the Terrible.

40:05.849 --> 40:08.113
Napoleon Bonaparte.

40:08.218 --> 40:10.209
And young Al Capone.

40:10.287 --> 40:11.345
Yeah.

40:11.422 --> 40:17.224
Some of the most despicable,
most feared leaders in all of history.

40:18.028 --> 40:19.393
Gentlemen,

40:20.197 --> 40:23.530
really, it's just fantastic
to meet you all.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.090
- And us, too.
- And me, you.

40:25.536 --> 40:30.473
All I ask is your allegiance,
and in return, I offer you the world.

40:30.841 --> 40:33.002
Literally. Are there any questions?

40:33.110 --> 40:36.011
Yeah, I got one.
How come you're wearing a dress?

40:36.280 --> 40:38.612
This is not a dress. This is a tunic.

40:39.116 --> 40:42.108
It was the height of fashion
3,000 years ago, I assure you.

40:42.519 --> 40:43.952
Are there any other questions?

40:44.021 --> 40:47.752
<i>Da.</i> This dress you're wearing,

40:47.825 --> 40:50.089
do we have to wear one of these, too?

40:51.495 --> 40:54.123
Were you not listening?
I just told Mr. Capone here

40:54.198 --> 40:55.825
that this is not a dress.

40:55.933 --> 40:59.596
It is, in fact, a tunic.
Very big difference.

41:00.471 --> 41:02.462
Are there any other questions?

41:03.040 --> 41:05.440
Any questions not about the dress?

41:06.210 --> 41:07.541
Tunic?

41:08.212 --> 41:10.180
All right, then. Moonlight is wasting,

41:10.280 --> 41:12.305
- and the time is short.
- Short?

41:12.883 --> 41:15.681
Why do you look at me
when you say "short"?

41:17.421 --> 41:19.150
Sorry. It slipped out.

41:21.558 --> 41:25.289
<i>Da.</i> If we are talking
about world domination,

41:25.362 --> 41:27.193
then of course, I am interested.

41:27.398 --> 41:31.061
But first I want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting.

41:31.301 --> 41:34.737
People always say,
"Ivan the Terrible, he's so terrible.

41:34.838 --> 41:37.534
"I'm so scared of Ivan. He's bad news."

41:37.641 --> 41:40.474
When in fact,
the correct translation is

41:41.311 --> 41:43.404
"Ivan the Awesome".

41:44.515 --> 41:46.142
Ivan the Awesome?

41:47.217 --> 41:48.809
It's not really as catchy, is it?

41:48.886 --> 41:51.753
I mean, "Ivan the Terrible",
that really pops.

41:52.022 --> 41:55.514
But I wasn't terrible. In fact,
I was quite an effective leader.

41:55.592 --> 41:59.255
Duly noted. Now, I'd like to wrap up
the old meet-and-greet

41:59.363 --> 42:01.695
by asking you gentlemen a question.

42:01.765 --> 42:04.063
Are you with me?

42:04.501 --> 42:05.991
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
<i>- Oui.</i>

42:06.236 --> 42:10.832
<i>- Da,</i> but...
- Then bring Larry Daley of Daley Devices

42:10.908 --> 42:13.877
and the Golden Tablet of Ahkmenrah
to me!

42:17.281 --> 42:19.511
We'll get you back down
to your chums, Mr. Daley.

42:19.583 --> 42:22.177
You won't get lost
following Amelia Earhart.

42:23.353 --> 42:24.752
Quick, get down.

42:28.225 --> 42:31.194
Well, well, Mr. Daley,
I quite like the way you're holding me.

42:31.862 --> 42:35.354
No. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

42:35.432 --> 42:37.423
Oh, please,
stop beating your gums, Mr. Daley.

42:37.534 --> 42:39.764
You haven't been able
to take your cheaters off my chassis

42:39.870 --> 42:41.462
since the moment we met.

42:41.572 --> 42:43.870
I literally didn't understand
one word of that.

42:48.545 --> 42:51.105
Is it just me
or is there music in the air?

42:51.215 --> 42:55.743
<i>... my baby, we can make it shine</i>
<i>We can take forever...</i>

42:55.819 --> 42:58.652
You! Little flying angel things! Quiet!

42:58.755 --> 43:01.280
They're cupids, Mr. Daley. Gods of love.

43:01.391 --> 43:05.088
Great. Gods of love, would you shut up?
Please shut up. We're trying to hide.

43:06.330 --> 43:09.026
<i>Yeah! More than a woman! Yeah!</i>

43:09.633 --> 43:14.332
No, don't change the arrangement,
it's not about the arrangement. Quiet!

43:14.972 --> 43:16.337
Kick the chorus, y'all!

43:16.440 --> 43:18.067
<i>More than a woman</i>

43:18.408 --> 43:20.433
Yo, show me what you got,
night guard!

43:20.511 --> 43:21.842
All right, come on. Let's go.

43:21.945 --> 43:24.573
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

43:25.482 --> 43:27.143
<i>More than a woman</i>

43:27.251 --> 43:29.583
<i>She's more than a woman</i>

43:35.158 --> 43:40.960
And so, the little tiny man who
could not be a smaller or shorter mouse

43:41.031 --> 43:43.795
runs into the claws of the giant cat!

43:44.201 --> 43:46.635
You're really hung up
on the height, aren't you?

43:46.703 --> 43:48.534
- No, it's not about height, see...
- Yes, you are.

43:48.605 --> 43:50.630
You're saying I'm a little mouse,
you're a giant cat.

43:50.707 --> 43:53.699
- I am the giant cat.
- No offense, I just...

43:53.810 --> 43:56.711
You're Napoleon.
There's a complex named after you.

43:56.813 --> 43:58.906
You're famous for being little,
and it's true. Look.

43:59.016 --> 44:01.576
Oh, you naive American man-boy.

44:01.685 --> 44:04.552
Look. Neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon, right?

44:04.655 --> 44:06.987
So it's not like we should...
It's not even an issue.

44:07.057 --> 44:11.585
It's not about height or something else.
It's a plan. It's a brilliant plan.

44:12.229 --> 44:14.754
- So it was a plan.
- Snazzy maneuver, Emperor.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.467
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

44:18.535 --> 44:21.698
Now, if your boyfriend
would kindly come with me...

44:21.772 --> 44:23.171
I'm not her boyfriend.

44:25.175 --> 44:26.870
- Not her boyfriend.
- No.

44:27.177 --> 44:28.667
Just friends?

44:31.214 --> 44:35.344
- Yeah, friends.
- Acquaintances. Friends.

44:37.788 --> 44:39.449
Were you guys, like, friends in college

44:39.556 --> 44:42.024
and just afraid now
to both ruin your relationship

44:42.092 --> 44:44.458
by telling the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

44:44.561 --> 44:46.085
that you like-like each other?

44:48.632 --> 44:51.726
One more time?
I'm sorry. I didn't catch the...

44:52.636 --> 44:54.263
Were you guys, like, friends in college

44:54.371 --> 44:56.202
and now both afraid
to ruin your relationship

44:56.273 --> 44:59.037
by telling the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

44:59.109 --> 45:01.134
that you like-like each other?

45:03.880 --> 45:05.643
- No.
- No?

45:05.749 --> 45:08.809
I just love the nitty-gritty of
relationships. All us French do.

45:08.919 --> 45:10.477
- Great.
- Yes. <i>Amour!</i>

45:10.587 --> 45:11.815
- Now.
- Yeah?

45:11.922 --> 45:14.220
- This way, or you die.
- Yes.

45:18.595 --> 45:21.962
- Wait, I'm coming with you!
- No! Our fight is not with you.

45:25.769 --> 45:29.261
...so you gotta bet a second time.
- All right. Okay.

45:30.641 --> 45:33.872
My hair is currency
in certain parts of Europe.

45:33.977 --> 45:37.037
It's true.
Currency, like gold or paper money.

45:37.714 --> 45:40.046
The Duomo was purchased
with just one locket.

45:40.183 --> 45:41.514
Listen up, kemosabe.

45:41.618 --> 45:45.452
This rodeo clown wouldn't know
a flapjack from a flyswatter.

45:45.522 --> 45:47.820
Now, Gigantor's out there
risking his hide for us.

45:47.891 --> 45:49.859
The least we can do
is give him some help.

45:49.960 --> 45:54.624
Some big help. But we can't very well do
that if we're stuck in here, now, can we?

45:55.699 --> 45:57.064
We need to escape.

45:58.168 --> 45:59.328
What's a flapjack?

45:59.403 --> 46:01.837
It's like a biscuit or a scone.

46:01.905 --> 46:04.305
- Chest bump?
- Yeah.

46:05.375 --> 46:07.138
Then deadly. Watch.

46:07.544 --> 46:10.240
Guard your cards, okay? Now you bet.

46:10.814 --> 46:12.907
Okay, now you got
to throw some cards down.

46:15.385 --> 46:17.250
- Ready?
- Ready.

46:17.587 --> 46:21.523
Say something. Say anything.
This is no fun. You're supposed to...

46:23.760 --> 46:26.160
- Hey! What are you two doing out here?
- Octavius, go!

46:26.229 --> 46:29.357
- You, make a run for it, I'll hold them off!
- I will not leave you!

46:29.433 --> 46:32.698
Ain't no time for your Roman melodrama!
Now, get! Go!

46:33.170 --> 46:34.660
Old Jedediah will be fine.

46:34.738 --> 46:36.035
Now, you're in real trouble.

46:40.744 --> 46:43.372
Why, these aren't real rubies at all.

46:44.114 --> 46:45.945
Ruby slippers indeed.

46:46.850 --> 46:53.847
But, whoever you are, Archie Bunker,
you had one comfortable throne.

46:54.858 --> 46:56.189
Hey, boss.

46:56.259 --> 46:59.524
Caught this one trying to escape
through a rust hole in the crate.

46:59.596 --> 47:01.427
One of his little friends got away.

47:01.531 --> 47:05.058
Oh, please.
What damage could they possibly do?

47:05.135 --> 47:09.071
Why, they're no bigger than
a little grain of couscous. Aren't you?

47:09.139 --> 47:11.369
You know, two words come to mind
when I hear you talk.

47:11.775 --> 47:13.902
"Delusional" and "weirdo".

47:14.478 --> 47:17.845
And if I had to say a third, "goofy".
Just goofy.

47:18.348 --> 47:21.840
Now you let old Jedediah out of here
or he's gonna get angry.

47:22.252 --> 47:23.844
Well played, Jedediah!

47:24.921 --> 47:27.651
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously.
You're just adorable,

47:28.158 --> 47:30.353
even when you're threatening me.
It's hilarious.

47:30.460 --> 47:34.590
Is it just me,
or are these guys unbelievably cute?

47:34.664 --> 47:35.790
Now hold it a second, now.

47:35.866 --> 47:38.596
Now, you have a right to keep me
as your captive, torture me, even,

47:38.668 --> 47:41.102
but don't call me cute! I ain't cute!

47:41.171 --> 47:46.199
Steady, my friend!
Just stay alive! I will find you!

47:51.314 --> 47:53.475
Gigantor. No!

47:54.117 --> 47:58.349
Hello, Mr. Daley. Nice to see you again.

47:59.790 --> 48:03.556
Now, if you don't mind,
I shall take that from you.

48:04.127 --> 48:05.526
Thank you.

48:06.663 --> 48:11.123
Finally. Finally! After 3,000 years,

48:12.636 --> 48:18.336
my evil army of the damned,
my beautiful, beautiful army,

48:18.408 --> 48:23.175
shall be unleashed!

48:31.321 --> 48:34.313
I'm afraid that Mother
and Father may have

48:34.391 --> 48:37.326
slightly changed the combination on me.

48:37.861 --> 48:40.830
I guess this whole
unleashing-the-underworld thing

48:40.897 --> 48:43.161
isn't really working out for you, huh?

48:43.233 --> 48:46.430
It must be really frustrating,
'cause you've waited thousands of years

48:46.536 --> 48:48.333
to come back from the dead
and everything,

48:48.405 --> 48:51.772
and now you can't get it open.

48:52.509 --> 48:55.740
Fear not, for I shall wait
a thousand more if I must.

48:55.846 --> 48:59.907
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'll be
standing here in a frustrated position,

49:00.016 --> 49:03.611
frozen, and I'll walk out of here
with my buddies and that'll be that.

49:03.720 --> 49:04.846
So, I got all night.

49:05.422 --> 49:08.516
Really? All night? Well!

49:09.059 --> 49:10.549
He doesn't.

49:19.769 --> 49:21.760
Open that cage.

49:21.872 --> 49:24.932
- What are you doing?
- No touching! No touching!

49:25.041 --> 49:26.474
Don't you manhandle me!

49:26.910 --> 49:29.708
- Look, he's having a little tantrum.
- Jed?

49:31.047 --> 49:34.073
Don't you squirm! Don't squirm.
It'll only be worse for you.

49:34.150 --> 49:36.380
- Put him down!
- Don't be afraid.

49:36.453 --> 49:38.045
I shan't hurt you.

49:39.089 --> 49:40.454
I lied.

49:41.791 --> 49:45.158
I don't think he has all night
at all, Mr. Daley.

49:45.729 --> 49:49.995
From the looks of things,
I'd say he has a little over an hour.

49:50.100 --> 49:51.727
Take me out of here!

49:53.503 --> 49:57.564
You were the guardian!
You know all about this tablet.

49:57.641 --> 50:00.838
You're obviously much more clever
than the rest of us.

50:00.911 --> 50:03.004
You may or may not
know the combination,

50:03.113 --> 50:06.378
but I am going to give you
exactly one hour to figure it out.

50:06.449 --> 50:09.418
If you do not,
I shall kill your friends.

50:09.486 --> 50:13.445
And please don't think about escaping,
for I shall be watching you.

50:13.523 --> 50:15.320
Look, I don't even know how to begin

50:15.425 --> 50:17.586
to decipher this thing,
all right? Really.

50:17.661 --> 50:19.288
What a pity.

50:19.362 --> 50:23.196
And your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow.

50:23.533 --> 50:29.438
Ah, well. Tick-tock, Mr. Daley.
Your hour has begun.

50:29.506 --> 50:34.307
Hey! You got this, partner.
I know you do.

50:41.451 --> 50:44.682
You got this!

50:51.561 --> 50:55.053
There you are! Are you all right?
I've been worried sick! Sick I tell you.

50:55.131 --> 50:57.929
- No, I'm fine.
- So what's our next move, partner?

50:58.001 --> 51:00.663
I don't know. I just got to get
this tablet translated.

51:02.138 --> 51:03.730
Oh, great! This guy again.

51:03.807 --> 51:06.640
Look, buddy,
we don't want any trouble, all right?

51:17.754 --> 51:19.085
Look at that!

51:19.189 --> 51:22.716
I guess our sassy cephalopod was just a
fish who didn't like being out of water.

51:23.593 --> 51:25.561
He's not such a ballywagger after all.

51:29.566 --> 51:31.932
Okay. Glad you're happy.

51:41.311 --> 51:43.609
Hello? A little assistance?

51:44.447 --> 51:46.438
- Hey, Teddy! Perfect!
- Yes!

51:46.549 --> 51:47.675
Maybe you could help us.

51:47.751 --> 51:49.343
I'd love to help you,
but first things first.

51:49.419 --> 51:51.751
My nose is so itchy,
it's driving me insane.

51:51.855 --> 51:55.120
I hate to ask, but, as you see,
I'm missing a few body parts.

51:55.225 --> 51:58.422
- Could you please give us a scratch?
- Yeah, sure.

51:59.396 --> 52:02.422
Oh, yes! That's exquisite.
A little over there...

52:02.532 --> 52:03.726
- Yes!
- More?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.064
Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, that's...

52:06.770 --> 52:09.295
Sweet rutabaga pie, that was divine.

52:09.806 --> 52:11.364
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

52:11.741 --> 52:14.301
Twenty-sixth President
of the United States, Rough Rider,

52:14.377 --> 52:16.436
founder of the national parks,
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

52:16.880 --> 52:20.577
- Have we met?
- No, there's another Teddy.

52:20.650 --> 52:25.212
- We have one of you in New York.
- Really? What's he like, this other me?

52:25.422 --> 52:28.550
He's pretty much the same,
except with...

52:28.625 --> 52:30.718
Except what? Say it.
Except with a body?

52:30.794 --> 52:33.228
- Yes. He has a body.
- Oh, dash it, the pain!

52:33.830 --> 52:35.661
- And a horse.
- Excuse me!

52:35.765 --> 52:38.393
We really need someone to translate
what's written on this tablet.

52:38.802 --> 52:41.999
- Do you read hieroglyphics?
- Yes, I do, missy.

52:42.105 --> 52:43.834
That's a simple one.

52:43.940 --> 52:47.967
Bird. Man with spear.
Sideways fish. Beetle. Vase.

52:48.845 --> 52:50.676
Okay, and what does that mean?

52:50.780 --> 52:53.840
It means, and this is
just a rough translation,

52:54.751 --> 52:58.847
"A man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase.

53:01.191 --> 53:02.852
"And there was also a beetle."

53:04.928 --> 53:07.897
- I don't think that's it.
- That's just one possible translation.

53:07.964 --> 53:09.488
Another possible translation is,

53:09.566 --> 53:11.534
"You will find the combination you seek

53:11.601 --> 53:15.435
"if you figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb."

53:15.839 --> 53:18.672
- Okay, and what does that mean?
- I don't know! What am I, the Sphinx?

53:18.741 --> 53:20.971
"What's this? What's that?"
Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

53:21.044 --> 53:23.444
I'm sure he'd love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing!

53:23.513 --> 53:25.140
Probably let his horse lick it, too!

53:25.215 --> 53:27.615
Mr. Daley, we should be going
to the sculpture gallery.

53:27.684 --> 53:29.845
I think there's someone there
who might have a better thought on this.

53:30.620 --> 53:32.588
The fellow we're looking for
is just down here.

53:32.655 --> 53:35.988
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>
- Hello, young lady.

53:36.493 --> 53:39.553
Hey, excuse me.
Could we keep moving, please?

53:39.629 --> 53:42.689
We certainly could, but then
we might miss a rare opportunity.

53:42.799 --> 53:45.324
I mean, she is a Degas, Mr. Daley.

53:45.401 --> 53:47.562
Okay, it's just I got a little buddy
stuck in an hourglass,

53:47.670 --> 53:49.399
I got a pitch meeting
at Wal-Mart in the morning...

53:49.506 --> 53:52.873
- It would be great if we could...
- He's right here.

53:53.743 --> 53:55.404
I think he'll have a thought on this.

53:55.745 --> 53:58.646
Mr. Thinker, we're sorry
to interrupt your contemplation,

53:58.715 --> 54:00.945
but we really need
to figure out the secret

54:01.017 --> 54:03.144
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

54:03.219 --> 54:06.382
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

54:07.857 --> 54:09.381
I'm thinking.

54:10.326 --> 54:14.763
- I'm thinking.
- It's not happening with him.

54:15.465 --> 54:16.796
Oh, wow.

54:16.866 --> 54:20.233
You've gotta be kidding me.
Check that out!

54:21.571 --> 54:24.199
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey! Hey!

54:24.274 --> 54:25.935
Buddy! Over here! This is serious.

54:26.009 --> 54:27.840
Apparently, it's a matter
of life and death.

54:28.244 --> 54:30.075
I'll tell you
what's a matter of life and death.

54:30.180 --> 54:31.875
That beautiful lady over there.

54:31.948 --> 54:35.406
Hey, baby! Check out the gun show
going on over here!

54:36.920 --> 54:38.444
Firepower!

54:38.855 --> 54:40.914
He's certainly no Einstein.

54:41.024 --> 54:43.857
- Biceps! Deltoids...
- Yeah.

54:43.927 --> 54:47.192
- Wait a minute. I saw a bunch of those.
- A bunch of whats?

54:47.263 --> 54:49.060
- Little Einsteins.
- Where?

54:50.099 --> 54:52.090
Over there, in Air and Space.

54:52.969 --> 54:54.698
I gotta get over there.

54:55.238 --> 54:56.364
What?

54:56.439 --> 54:59.931
- Nothing.
- Okay. Then why are you staring at me?

55:00.577 --> 55:02.272
I don't wanna miss a moment.

55:02.378 --> 55:04.710
All right, good, but we should
get going, 'cause we...

55:05.882 --> 55:08.350
- Why?
- You talk too much, ace.

55:13.389 --> 55:14.788
I don't know why I did that, Mr. Daley.

55:14.891 --> 55:17.985
I just feel as if I've been asleep
for a long time and now, suddenly,

55:18.394 --> 55:19.622
I'm awake.

55:19.896 --> 55:21.761
I can explain that...

55:22.632 --> 55:24.395
But really, I could. I really...

55:25.268 --> 55:26.826
Again, why?

55:32.075 --> 55:33.406
Great, you're back.

55:38.014 --> 55:40.414
Okay. Yeah. Great.

55:40.483 --> 55:43.577
Love theme from <i>Titanic.</i>
Good, but not really appropriate.

55:47.423 --> 55:50.153
You don't let yourself enjoy things
much, do you, Mr. Daley?

55:51.327 --> 55:54.228
Okay, you know what?
It's not really the song choice.

55:54.297 --> 55:56.162
And by the way, you're a little pitchy.

55:56.232 --> 55:59.326
Well, I thought you were amazing,
and you look wonderful.

56:01.004 --> 56:02.904
Could you just fly away, please?

56:03.740 --> 56:05.503
And so the adventure continues.

56:08.478 --> 56:11.675
What did I tell you? Enough!

56:18.888 --> 56:24.155
You know, I do sort of feel
like a floating butterfly.

56:24.594 --> 56:27.085
You are crazier than a road lizard.

56:27.196 --> 56:31.223
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard
that we're taking over the world

56:31.334 --> 56:34.269
and they want in.
I don't know who they are,

56:34.370 --> 56:37.737
but they're on exhibit here,
too, apparently.

56:38.608 --> 56:40.769
I don't even know what they are.

56:40.877 --> 56:46.008
I'm sorry, but we're all full up
in our axis of evil today. Sorry.

56:46.082 --> 56:49.245
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

56:49.352 --> 56:51.843
Hey, I could show you how bad I am!

56:53.289 --> 56:54.950
Fear me!

56:57.060 --> 56:58.721
I'm sorry. I'm just not buying it.

56:58.795 --> 57:03.232
You don't seem very bad. You just seem
sort of vaguely grouchy to me.

57:04.133 --> 57:05.532
Oh, boy.

57:07.236 --> 57:09.898
What are you doing?
What is that? What is this?

57:09.972 --> 57:12.236
What does it mean? You've lost me.

57:12.308 --> 57:15.971
Is that you breathing?
Because I can't hear myself think.

57:16.713 --> 57:19.739
Can I make one suggestion
to you, my friend? Just simplify.

57:19.816 --> 57:22.250
There's just too much going on here.

57:22.318 --> 57:26.812
You're evil, you're asthmatic, you're
a robot... And what is the cape for?

57:26.923 --> 57:29.483
Are we going to the opera?
I don't think so.

57:29.592 --> 57:31.719
Sorry! Goodbye.

57:31.794 --> 57:33.318
<i>Attention!</i>

57:33.429 --> 57:35.294
He's leaving with the tablet!

57:35.998 --> 57:37.556
Where?

57:38.901 --> 57:40.334
Give me that.

57:40.903 --> 57:44.930
He's not trying to figure out the...
He's trying to escape!

57:45.007 --> 57:49.068
Go. Go! All of you! Kill him!
And bring me that tablet.

57:49.312 --> 57:52.839
Come on, people! Let's go!
Without that tablet, we've nothing!

57:52.949 --> 57:54.678
<i>Streltsy!</i> Go!

57:57.286 --> 58:00.687
Thought you could get away,
didn't you, Larry Daley?

58:09.132 --> 58:10.690
Criminy, we're jimmy-jacked.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.927
- Jimmy-jacked? Really?
- It's the way I speak.

58:13.002 --> 58:15.266
Yeah, I know, but that one
sounds made up, even for you.

58:15.338 --> 58:19.434
"Oh, no, our path has been blocked
by bad people." What's the fun in that?

58:19.609 --> 58:22.271
The point is, we're not getting into
the Air and Space right now.

58:22.345 --> 58:24.370
- You're right. We are jimmy-jacked.
- Jimmy-jacked.

58:24.847 --> 58:26.212
Come on.

58:36.192 --> 58:38.524
They say a good man rules this union.

58:39.128 --> 58:41.460
I promised Jedediah I would bring help,

58:41.998 --> 58:43.966
and help I will bring.

58:48.004 --> 58:50.802
Charge!

59:03.820 --> 59:05.720
Misjudged the distance.

59:09.592 --> 59:11.025
Who's there?

59:16.899 --> 59:18.526
Jupiter, protect me.

59:23.272 --> 59:26.298
Remain very still.

59:27.043 --> 59:29.341
They can sense movement.

59:31.948 --> 59:34.280
Apparently, they can also hear me
talking to myself.

59:36.752 --> 59:38.515
I'm not a nut.

59:40.189 --> 59:41.781
No!

59:48.698 --> 59:50.757
We should be okay in here for a while.

59:55.805 --> 59:58.069
So, how long
have you guarded antiquities?

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.802
What? Oh, no,
I don't actually work at the...

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:02.707
I just thought
with the fancy getup and all...

01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:04.902
No, I borrowed this.

01:00:05.414 --> 01:00:09.942
I mean, I was a guard back in New York,
but that was a while ago.

01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:13.985
So why did you leave?
Did you not enjoy it?

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.717
No, I loved it. I just...

01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:18.658
Things sort of took off
in a different direction, so...

01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:22.219
- So what do you do now?
- Well, I sort of...

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:25.963
Well, I sort of design products
and sell them.

01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:28.165
- You're an inventor!
- I am.

01:00:28.271 --> 01:00:30.136
I am an inventor, yeah. I invent stuff.

01:00:30.406 --> 01:00:31.930
Like the rocket ship?

01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:33.669
- No.
- The sea plane.

01:00:33.776 --> 01:00:36.574
- The dirigible?
- No, not aircraft.

01:00:36.646 --> 01:00:39.444
Sort of like more
small-scale stuff, like...

01:00:39.782 --> 01:00:43.741
Well, the Glow-in-the-Dark
Flashlight, that was mine.

01:00:45.755 --> 01:00:47.450
So this new job, do you like it?

01:00:48.024 --> 01:00:51.619
Yeah, I like it a lot.
It's exciting. It's...

01:00:53.262 --> 01:00:55.526
- What?
- I'm just confused, is all.

01:00:55.631 --> 01:00:57.826
If you're not excited by it,
why do you do it?

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:02.031
- I am excited by it. I just said...
- I know what you said, Mr. Daley,

01:01:02.138 --> 01:01:05.471
but what I see in front of me
is a man who's lost his moxie.

01:01:06.776 --> 01:01:08.937
I have not lost my...

01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:11.109
I got my moxie.

01:01:11.447 --> 01:01:12.971
Do you know why I became a pilot?

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.517
- I don't, no.
- For the fun of it.

01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:20.522
Why else would anyone do anything?

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.718
Great Gatsby!

01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:30.790
Blast these pigeons
and their incessant cooing!

01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:33.801
- No! Mr. President! Sir!
- All right. Time to see the state...

01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:37.134
- Please don't get up!
...of this great union! I always say,

01:01:37.206 --> 01:01:40.903
leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.035
Sir, if you go out there,
you're gonna freak a lot of people out!

01:01:43.145 --> 01:01:46.911
Freak? I assure you, sir,
I am no freak.

01:01:47.016 --> 01:01:51.419
- No, I didn't mean you're a freak...
- Come here, little one.

01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:55.552
In fact, if anyone is freakish,
I'm afraid it's you, sir.

01:01:56.058 --> 01:01:58.891
The truth is, you are very small.

01:01:58.995 --> 01:02:01.691
And I mean
even for a regular-sized human.

01:02:01.764 --> 01:02:04.528
What? Why would you even say that?

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:06.995
I must be honest.

01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:10.436
Right. Okay, Honest Abe.
Of course. I'm sorry. Great.

01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:12.837
Come, now, Mr. President,
put the little man down

01:02:12.908 --> 01:02:15.172
and let's sit our fanny back
in that throne of yours.

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:18.736
You have a can-do attitude,
and I shall do as you ask.

01:02:18.848 --> 01:02:20.440
Thank you.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.615
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:02:22.718 --> 01:02:27.121
It's that very can-do spirit that has
defined this remarkable nation of ours.

01:02:27.223 --> 01:02:28.713
- Interesting story.
- They're coming.

01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:30.088
One night in Gettysburg...

01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:31.921
Mr. President, we're gonna need you
to hold still now.

01:02:32.028 --> 01:02:33.757
- What?
- Abraham, freeze!

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:35.626
Freeze? I...

01:02:42.905 --> 01:02:44.964
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:45.074 --> 01:02:47.565
- Come on, let's get to Air and Space.
- If I may,

01:02:47.643 --> 01:02:51.079
- you two make an adorable couple.
- Oh, no, we're not...

01:02:51.147 --> 01:02:52.808
No, we're not a...
I mean, we're not a...

01:02:52.915 --> 01:02:56.112
"We're not a... I mean, we're not a..."

01:02:56.218 --> 01:02:57.742
I never lie!

01:02:58.087 --> 01:03:01.614
The truth is,
you two are adorable together.

01:03:01.724 --> 01:03:03.157
Thank you. Good night.

01:03:03.259 --> 01:03:08.720
Farewell, lovely lady
and small, little man.

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:12.930
Now let's see if we can find
these Einsteins of yours.

01:03:30.386 --> 01:03:32.854
<i>One giant leap for a mannequin...</i>

01:03:33.556 --> 01:03:38.550
<i>D.C., this is Air and Space. We are</i>
<i>back online and fully operational.</i>

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:47.727
The Tuskegee Airmen
are on the march once again.

01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:51.796
Can you stop narrating everything
we're doing? Just live in the moment.

01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:55.435
The Tuskegee Airmen
are living in the moment!

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:56.944
- Miss Earhart?
- Yes.

01:03:57.012 --> 01:03:59.173
- I wanna say thank you.
- What for, Captain?

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:01.545
A lot of people didn't think
we could fly, either.

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.811
Thanks for clearing the runway, ma'am.

01:04:07.323 --> 01:04:09.553
- Race you to Paris?
- You're on!

01:04:09.658 --> 01:04:10.989
No! Not now! We gotta...

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.324
- It's just a quick jaunt over the pond.
- No. Gotta find the Einsteins.

01:04:13.395 --> 01:04:16.489
Come on, we gotta go.
We don't have time. Come on!

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:18.897
Sorry, it's in the blood.

01:04:19.635 --> 01:04:21.227
There she is, Mr. Daley.

01:04:21.337 --> 01:04:24.966
Old Bessie, the old family bus.
That gal took me across the Atlantic!

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.008
Okay. I think the Einsteins
are over here, though.

01:04:27.076 --> 01:04:29.772
<i>This is Mission Control.</i>
<i>Flight check complete.</i>

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:32.336
- Where'd you go? Where'd they go?
<i>- You are clear for launch.</i>

01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:33.881
Contact!

01:04:33.983 --> 01:04:35.883
<i>D.C., this is Mission Control.</i>

01:04:36.652 --> 01:04:39.746
- No, no! No!
<i>- All systems go and green for lift-off.</i>

01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:42.323
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>We are green for lift-off.</i>

01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:45.155
No, we're definitely not green
for any kind of lift-off!

01:04:45.227 --> 01:04:49.027
- I want a "go, no-go" for launch.
- I say no-go. Let's not go.

01:04:49.098 --> 01:04:50.190
Go!

01:04:50.766 --> 01:04:52.233
Go!

01:04:53.002 --> 01:04:54.993
- Go!
- No! No go!

01:04:55.571 --> 01:04:57.266
<i>Torquing angles incoming.</i>

01:04:57.373 --> 01:04:59.432
Tone it down with the torque.
Torque it down.

01:04:59.542 --> 01:05:01.100
De-torque. De-torque.

01:05:03.012 --> 01:05:04.843
Commence ignition sequence.

01:05:04.914 --> 01:05:07.439
- Roger that, flight.
- We have launch commit.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.711
- No. No, no, no!
<i>- Ten,</i>

01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:12.049
<i>nine, eight, seven...</i>

01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:14.214
- Hey, that's mine.
<i>- No, we do not have commit.</i>

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:17.225
<i>Repeat. We are decommissioning</i>
<i>the committal of the launch</i>

01:05:17.293 --> 01:05:22.959
<i>and it is now a negatory launch phase.</i>
<i>We are in a no-fly, no-go phase.</i>

01:05:23.065 --> 01:05:27.764
<i>That is a November-Gorgon phase</i>
<i>of non-flying!</i>

01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:29.735
- Fine!
<i>- And we're gonna say good night.</i>

01:05:29.805 --> 01:05:32.330
<i>Thank you. Good work. Over and out.</i>

01:05:33.709 --> 01:05:35.643
- Sorry.
- Damn, that was disappointing.

01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:37.679
Come on. I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

01:05:38.414 --> 01:05:40.143
Hey, little space monkey.

01:05:43.152 --> 01:05:46.087
You're Able. Okay, good. How you doing?

01:05:46.722 --> 01:05:48.587
Yes, good. At ease. All right.

01:05:50.459 --> 01:05:52.825
You're a polite little fella,
aren't you?

01:05:52.928 --> 01:05:56.056
Hey, you happen to know where those
little Einstein bobblehead guys are?

01:05:57.366 --> 01:05:59.834
Mr. Daley! I found your Einsteins.

01:06:00.502 --> 01:06:01.764
Great. Hey...

01:06:01.837 --> 01:06:05.466
Gentlemen, we're trying to crack
the combination of this tablet doodad,

01:06:05.574 --> 01:06:08.065
and the writing here says we'll find it

01:06:08.143 --> 01:06:11.601
if we figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:16.449
That's an easy one.
The answer's in the question.

01:06:16.952 --> 01:06:18.783
- What does that mean?
- "Figure out".

01:06:18.854 --> 01:06:21.448
It's a figure! I.e., a number.

01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:24.356
And the Pharaoh's tomb,
i.e. the pyramids.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.020
Don't you get it, kid?
You're looking for the secret number

01:06:27.129 --> 01:06:28.994
at the heart of the pyramids.

01:06:29.498 --> 01:06:31.796
Well, whistle me <i>Dixie,</i> the answer's pi!

01:06:32.134 --> 01:06:35.695
- Pi?
- 3.14159265, to be exact.

01:06:35.804 --> 01:06:38.864
Yes! 3.1495265.

01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:42.034
No, no, no, 3.14159265.

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:44.203
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.314
I'm sorry, I can't tell.
Is it yes or no? Cause you just...

01:06:47.383 --> 01:06:49.112
I know it's hard, could you just...

01:06:49.184 --> 01:06:50.515
Don't touch the hair.

01:06:50.619 --> 01:06:54.180
- Sorry, I can't tell if it's up or...
- I'm a bobblehead, <i>dummkopf,</i>

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:57.453
and that's the way we like it.
All together, now!

01:06:57.526 --> 01:07:01.553
<i>That's the way</i>
<i>We like it</i>

01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:03.655
You know,
we can't all be Einsteins, so...

01:07:03.732 --> 01:07:04.892
- I can!
- We are!

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.524
- He is!
- Me, too!

01:07:06.635 --> 01:07:08.398
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, here it is.

01:07:08.504 --> 01:07:10.972
- Can you slow it down a little bit?
- Okay.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.203
3.14159265.

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.801
- Okay. 3.14...
- I've got it.

01:07:17.413 --> 01:07:19.347
- Thank you, Mr. Einsteins.
- Thank you.

01:07:20.649 --> 01:07:26.178
All right. Now, like the brilliant
and famous general that I am,

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.348
I thought long and hard
about what you said,

01:07:28.424 --> 01:07:32.417
and I've come up with a brand-new
and improved battle plan!

01:07:34.863 --> 01:07:36.228
Okay.

01:07:37.499 --> 01:07:41.492
I will loudly announce that we are not

01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:44.437
going to attack, and then...

01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:46.774
Wait for it.

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:52.006
"What's the amazing Custer about to say
now? I hope he's my friend, or..."

01:07:52.681 --> 01:07:54.171
We attack!

01:07:57.786 --> 01:08:01.381
Didn't expect your friend
to run off like that, did you?

01:08:01.757 --> 01:08:04.089
He's coming back, Ka-Ka-Ro.

01:08:04.193 --> 01:08:07.959
Sure as moon shines on a mongoose,
he'll be here.

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:11.256
I would save my breath if I were you.

01:08:11.367 --> 01:08:13.528
You don't have many left.

01:08:16.572 --> 01:08:19.040
We've got about 10 minutes
to get over there to Jed.

01:08:19.108 --> 01:08:21.941
I think we make a good team,
perhaps more than a team.

01:08:22.044 --> 01:08:24.035
Wait. Okay, wait.

01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:25.808
What's the matter?
You didn't like kissing me?

01:08:25.913 --> 01:08:29.816
No, I did. It was great. I mean,
the slapping hurt a little bit, but...

01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:34.287
- So you don't like me, then.
- Of course I like you. You're incredible.

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.721
I think you're an amazing person.
You're...

01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:40.728
It's just there are certain issues
that would prevent us from...

01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:45.062
- I just... You're not...
- I'm not what, Mr. Daley?

01:08:47.903 --> 01:08:50.895
Okay. You're made of...

01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:53.606
Made of...

01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:06.814
Wonderful things.
You're made of good, wonderful things.

01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:14.020
Come on.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.832
Gentlemen, could you
buy us some time please?

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:28.506
It'll have to do.

01:09:30.045 --> 01:09:32.843
No! That's the first plane ever made!

01:09:32.948 --> 01:09:35.609
It's made out of balsa wood and paper.

01:09:35.684 --> 01:09:39.211
It's made out of spruce and canvas and
good old-fashioned American ingenuity.

01:09:40.354 --> 01:09:41.822
Are you coming, or what?

01:09:46.361 --> 01:09:49.796
- Out of our way!
- I don't think so.

01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:52.863
They're getting away!

01:09:57.005 --> 01:10:00.168
Hang on, Mr. Daley.
Things are about to get interesting.

01:10:07.649 --> 01:10:09.913
A lady pilot! Preposterous!

01:10:10.052 --> 01:10:13.317
- Think again, boys!
- Oh, she's good.

01:10:31.073 --> 01:10:33.007
What? What?

01:10:33.075 --> 01:10:35.236
One of the wires is jammed.
I'm going to have to loosen it.

01:10:35.344 --> 01:10:37.539
- Here, take the stick!
- No! I'm not gonna... No!

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:39.171
I know you've got moxie in you yet.

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:42.843
Moxie doesn't fly planes! People
who have pilots' licenses fly planes!

01:10:42.918 --> 01:10:44.442
- Okay.
- She's all yours.

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:48.852
I don't want it! I don't want the stick!

01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:55.390
Don't look now, Mr. Daley,
but you're flying an airplane!

01:11:06.942 --> 01:11:08.603
Able! The doors!

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.554
- Got it!
- Pull!

01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:32.164
Pull up!

01:11:38.273 --> 01:11:39.399
Yes!

01:11:39.474 --> 01:11:41.169
Godspeed, Amelia Earhart!

01:11:41.276 --> 01:11:42.675
Godspeed.

01:12:21.316 --> 01:12:23.614
Look a little nervous there,
Ramen Noodle.

01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:25.880
'Cause for me,
this is like a spa treatment.

01:12:26.288 --> 01:12:30.486
Sand baths are really rejuvenating
for the skin. Exfoliates.

01:12:31.226 --> 01:12:32.625
Giving up yet?

01:12:32.794 --> 01:12:34.625
Not quite yet, no.

01:12:35.297 --> 01:12:39.427
In fact, let's see
if we can't make time fly.

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:47.068
What is that funny sound?

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.422
Stop!

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.000
Right there, please, Mr. Daley.

01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:16.198
Well. Well, well, well!

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:18.762
You certainly know how to make
an entrance, Mr. Daley.

01:13:18.874 --> 01:13:20.273
Time to recruit some backup.

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:22.843
I hope for your
little friend's sake, here,

01:13:22.911 --> 01:13:25.277
that you also figured out
the combination.

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.904
- Give me Jed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:13:27.015 --> 01:13:29.745
First, give me the combination
and hand over that tablet.

01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:31.443
I'll give you the tablet
and the combination

01:13:31.553 --> 01:13:33.214
when you release my friends
and give him back to me.

01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:37.189
I shall release what I want to release
the moment I want to release it.

01:13:37.259 --> 01:13:38.886
Great. And I'll release
what I want to release

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.689
at the exact moment
that I want to release it, okay?

01:13:40.762 --> 01:13:43.458
Tell me the combination
and give me that tablet right now

01:13:43.565 --> 01:13:45.533
or I shall kill all of your friends,

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.398
starting with the little
shaggy-headed little cowman here.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:51.871
I ain't shaggy-headed!
Gigantor, let me take this guy!

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.568
Don't worry, I got this handled.
You don't want to give me my friends,

01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:56.543
then you're not gonna get
your combination or your tablet.

01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:58.044
- All right, I'll tell you what.
- Good.

01:13:58.113 --> 01:14:00.980
They didn't call me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy for nothing.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.745
Here you go. They didn't call me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy!

01:14:03.819 --> 01:14:05.753
They called me
Kahmunrah the Bloodthirsty,

01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:09.450
who kills whoever doesn't
give Kahmunrah exactly what he wants

01:14:09.558 --> 01:14:11.856
in the moment that he wants it,
which is right now,

01:14:11.927 --> 01:14:15.124
when I had also better get
the combination and the tablet!

01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:18.723
- That's what they called you?
- It was shorter in Egyptian.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.529
Great, I'll give you
the combination after you give him back.

01:14:20.602 --> 01:14:23.662
How dare you? If you touch that again,
I shall kill you right now.

01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:25.366
- Okay.
- Do not touch this.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.307
- This is a no-touching zone!
- Good. Well, then...

01:14:28.377 --> 01:14:32.404
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you reached across like that again!

01:14:32.481 --> 01:14:35.917
I can't even believe it!
Oh, God, I want to kill you right...

01:14:35.984 --> 01:14:39.715
If you didn't know this combination,
you'd be so dead right now,

01:14:39.788 --> 01:14:42.780
- it would be unbelievable.
- Great, but I do know the combination.

01:14:42.991 --> 01:14:46.950
Don't cross this line with your hand!

01:14:47.062 --> 01:14:52.967
How dare you! If you
speak again, I'm going to kill you.

01:14:53.068 --> 01:14:54.558
Do you understand this?

01:14:54.636 --> 01:14:56.501
Don't say it!
Oh, God, I see you getting ready.

01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:58.732
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Oh, my God, don't say anything.

01:14:58.807 --> 01:15:00.934
I shall murder you if you talk again.

01:15:01.009 --> 01:15:06.140
Now give me that tablet
and tell me the combination.

01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:09.077
Okay. After you give me Jed
and release my friends.

01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:11.350
- You did all three!
- What?

01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:13.353
You spoke
and you reached your hand across!

01:15:13.455 --> 01:15:15.320
Look. I can talk to you about this
all night, okay?

01:15:15.424 --> 01:15:16.789
- How about this?
- Look, just give...

01:15:16.858 --> 01:15:19.156
How about I don't kill you right now,
like I really, really want to,

01:15:19.261 --> 01:15:21.286
and I give you precisely five seconds

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:24.093
to give me that tablet
and tell me the combination?

01:15:24.166 --> 01:15:27.761
We already got the combination. It's pi.

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:32.869
- 3.14159265.
- No!

01:15:32.974 --> 01:15:34.601
- Hey.
- Sorry.

01:15:35.343 --> 01:15:41.373
So Crazy Hair here, he sang.
Oh, did he sing! Like a canary.

01:15:42.117 --> 01:15:43.550
I'm sorry, Larry.

01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:46.143
Enough out of you!
Remember what happened last time?

01:15:46.521 --> 01:15:48.045
- That's enough.
- Stupid man.

01:15:51.159 --> 01:15:53.559
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:15:53.662 --> 01:15:56.130
Must be a real bummer for you, Larry,

01:15:57.065 --> 01:16:01.126
knowing that all of your valiant efforts
were, in the end, for naught.

01:16:02.504 --> 01:16:06.201
What a terrible disappointment
you must be to yourself.

01:16:15.884 --> 01:16:17.909
Do you hear that humming sound?

01:16:19.521 --> 01:16:21.546
Do you know what that sound is?

01:16:23.658 --> 01:16:25.091
It's rhetorical.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.389
That is the sound of the End.

01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:38.763
I'm sorry, Jed.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.536
You did your best, Gigantor.

01:16:42.177 --> 01:16:44.441
Dadgum it, we almost had him, too.

01:16:44.546 --> 01:16:47.743
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around
the last couple of years at the museum.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:52.286
- Maybe none of this would have happened.
- You don't get it, do you, Gigantor?

01:16:52.387 --> 01:16:54.787
I didn't call you
'cause we needed your help.

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:56.551
Sure, we were in a little pickle,

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:58.115
but it wouldn't have been the first time

01:16:58.226 --> 01:17:00.854
I had to wrestle my way
out of a root sack.

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:04.699
No, partner.
I called you 'cause you needed us.

01:17:05.534 --> 01:17:08.901
That fancy suit you've been parading
around in these past couple years,

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.063
that there's a hanging suit.

01:17:11.139 --> 01:17:14.040
All gussied up, but dead inside.

01:17:14.643 --> 01:17:15.974
That ain't you.

01:17:16.878 --> 01:17:19.438
- And I'll tell you another thing.
- Yeah.

01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:21.209
This night ain't over yet.

01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:25.080
This little Midnight Cowboy's
got some fight left in him.

01:17:25.153 --> 01:17:28.316
Something tells me you do, too. Ho, now!

01:17:57.319 --> 01:18:02.086
Welcome to the new,
extended reign of Kahmunrah,

01:18:02.157 --> 01:18:03.954
Fifth King of Egypt

01:18:04.025 --> 01:18:06.789
and now the world!

01:18:07.362 --> 01:18:10.763
Horus, Ra, my warriors, come forth!

01:18:11.266 --> 01:18:16.203
Send Larry Daley
and his friends to their doom!

01:18:41.029 --> 01:18:42.656
Halt!

01:18:43.665 --> 01:18:46.532
The mighty Octavius has returned!

01:18:46.635 --> 01:18:52.039
I ride on the back of nature's
most fearsome creature! I ride

01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:56.340
the squirrel!

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.006
Forward now, my mighty steed!

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.221
Whoa, girl! Easy.

01:19:08.323 --> 01:19:10.484
Do you wish to surrender honorably?

01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:13.823
Or must this end
with the spilling of your blood?

01:19:15.997 --> 01:19:18.625
This? This is your big rescue?

01:19:19.534 --> 01:19:22.503
Oh, no. This is!

01:19:33.915 --> 01:19:36.543
What is that thing?

01:19:36.618 --> 01:19:38.745
The name is Abraham Lincoln.

01:19:38.853 --> 01:19:42.289
- And you, sir, are in a heap of trouble!
- Attack it!

01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:51.494
Disgusting half-pigeons!

01:20:02.143 --> 01:20:04.611
No, no, no! Hello?

01:20:04.713 --> 01:20:07.045
<i>Adiós,</i> bird brains!

01:20:07.115 --> 01:20:08.810
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:10.908
Goodbye, strange birdmen.

01:20:11.052 --> 01:20:12.986
Do not return to the Underworld!

01:20:13.088 --> 01:20:15.079
Yes, yes, do go back
into the Underworld!

01:20:15.156 --> 01:20:16.714
Thank you for coming! Good night!

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:17.849
No, no!

01:20:26.468 --> 01:20:29.562
Oh, this is awkward.

01:20:29.904 --> 01:20:32.668
It appears my work here is done.

01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:38.736
Just remember, son, a house divided
against itself cannot stand.

01:20:41.516 --> 01:20:42.540
Farewell.

01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:47.278
- What now?
- You know, I'm not quite sure.

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:52.085
I suppose we should probably start
by watching him die.

01:20:53.294 --> 01:20:56.593
<i>Streltsy!</i> Make him dead!

01:20:59.634 --> 01:21:01.431
Now what?

01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:06.966
We are not going to attack right

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:10.169
now!

01:21:18.987 --> 01:21:20.784
Get them!

01:21:40.508 --> 01:21:43.170
Fear not, Larry!
I will help Jedediah!

01:21:43.244 --> 01:21:44.905
You come at them from behind!

01:21:47.315 --> 01:21:49.215
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm hiding.

01:21:49.317 --> 01:21:51.547
Hiding? What are you doing?
Come on, we need you.

01:21:52.053 --> 01:21:55.682
- I'm a failure.
- No, you're not.

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:58.520
Did you foolishly lead
208 Americans to their deaths

01:21:58.626 --> 01:22:00.321
at the Battle of Little Bighorn?

01:22:01.529 --> 01:22:05.966
- No.
- No? Not good. Not good at all.

01:22:06.034 --> 01:22:08.468
- That's not good.
- Sure, I talk a good game,

01:22:08.536 --> 01:22:11.300
but the truth of the matter is,
I don't deserve these stars.

01:22:12.807 --> 01:22:16.140
I will always be famous
for my biggest failure.

01:22:19.247 --> 01:22:20.339
Hey.

01:22:20.715 --> 01:22:22.706
The past is the past, okay?

01:22:23.418 --> 01:22:26.148
Right now, this moment, this night,

01:22:27.622 --> 01:22:29.522
this is what you're gonna be
remembered for.

01:22:31.259 --> 01:22:32.920
This is your last stand.

01:22:50.612 --> 01:22:53.103
- They need a leader.
- Yeah, they need a leader.

01:22:55.049 --> 01:22:57.279
Yeah? You want to be their leader, huh?

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.116
- Yeah, I do.
- Let's do this!

01:23:00.755 --> 01:23:01.881
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:03.321
Let's go!

01:23:05.627 --> 01:23:07.026
Not good!

01:23:07.528 --> 01:23:08.517
<i>Larry!</i>

01:23:09.264 --> 01:23:10.356
Hey, Able!

01:23:10.431 --> 01:23:11.420
<i>I want to help!</i>

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:12.658
Oh, great.

01:23:12.734 --> 01:23:14.429
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>This is my museum!</i>

01:23:14.802 --> 01:23:16.565
<i>Well, he's my human.</i>
<i>Back off!</i>

01:23:16.771 --> 01:23:18.329
<i>You need all the help you can get,</i>
<i>Jungle-Dweller!</i>

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.929
<i>Get over yourself space snob!</i>

01:23:20.008 --> 01:23:21.032
Guys! Hey, guys!

01:23:21.109 --> 01:23:22.974
This is not the time
to get into this, all right?

01:23:25.246 --> 01:23:26.577
Dexter, you know better.

01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:30.414
All right?
That's what happens when you do that!

01:23:30.485 --> 01:23:31.816
You get that.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.392
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

01:23:41.963 --> 01:23:44.955
Now, listen. You're both proud capuchin!

01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:47.630
You need to concentrate
on slapping the enemy!

01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:52.803
Keep it together, all right?

01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:54.807
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

01:23:56.778 --> 01:23:59.611
- Jedediah! They need us!
- I ain't gonna make it!

01:24:00.014 --> 01:24:02.482
Afraid this cowboy's been
to his last hoedown.

01:24:02.984 --> 01:24:08.820
Octavius, remember me as I was,
wild, and free, and...

01:24:10.091 --> 01:24:13.527
- No need for final words.
- I'm not finished yet.

01:24:13.962 --> 01:24:15.725
I want to get
to the story of our relationship,

01:24:15.797 --> 01:24:18.095
the evolution from enemy to friends.

01:24:18.266 --> 01:24:20.598
- No!
- It'll make you cry!

01:24:20.668 --> 01:24:23.933
No! Because you are going to live!

01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:37.384
- Let's go to work.
- Have a sword.

01:24:38.519 --> 01:24:39.952
Sword!

01:24:57.171 --> 01:24:58.832
Incoming!

01:25:18.092 --> 01:25:19.320
That smarts.

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:25.660
You smack, you kick!
You smack, you kick!

01:25:25.733 --> 01:25:29.066
You smack, you kick!
Teamwork, fellas! <i>Wunderbar!</i>

01:25:33.007 --> 01:25:34.372
How you doing, fellas?

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.269
- Are you all right?
- Never better.

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:09.536
Listen, when I give you the signal,
I want you to open the gate.

01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:12.443
- I take it you have a plan.
- I'm gonna divide the house.

01:26:17.585 --> 01:26:20.053
The tablet! Now!

01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:21.554
Okay, sure, you can have it.

01:26:21.622 --> 01:26:23.613
Just tell me who the boss is
and I'll give it to you.

01:26:23.724 --> 01:26:26.215
Or should I give it to Kahmunrah?
He's your master, right?

01:26:26.494 --> 01:26:30.157
<i>- Nyet!</i> He is not our master!
- Really? 'Cause he acts like he is.

01:26:30.264 --> 01:26:32.255
But fine, just tell me who the boss is
and you can have it.

01:26:32.333 --> 01:26:34.733
Hey! That'd be me.

01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:39.267
This man is a peasant!
I am the only one here of noble birth!

01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:42.309
Really? 'Cause he's got more medals
and a bigger hat, but...

01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:44.435
- Thank you.
- You might got a lot of medals,

01:26:44.512 --> 01:26:47.140
but you put one of your
little child hands on that tablet again,

01:26:47.248 --> 01:26:50.081
it'll be the last thing them tiny
little mitts of yours ever touch.

01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:52.016
Why would you touch little Nippy?

01:26:54.088 --> 01:26:55.453
I can handle this, okay?

01:26:55.523 --> 01:26:58.617
You can handle nothing!
You can barely speak, you fool!

01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:02.629
You know what? No problem.
I'll give it to you. You see that?

01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:08.093
Oh, you're a spunky little fella!

01:27:12.306 --> 01:27:17.710
Very clever, Mr. Daley, getting them
to fight amongst themselves.

01:27:17.812 --> 01:27:21.612
Yeah. I can't really take credit.
It was Abraham Lincoln's idea.

01:27:21.682 --> 01:27:24.048
You know, a house divided can't...

01:27:24.886 --> 01:27:26.877
- Doesn't do well.
- Yes, well,

01:27:26.988 --> 01:27:30.685
you should have saved yourself
when you had the chance,

01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:34.557
because now I shall have
the tremendous pleasure

01:27:34.962 --> 01:27:36.293
of killing you myself!

01:28:27.081 --> 01:28:28.446
What are you?

01:28:30.618 --> 01:28:32.051
I'm the night guard.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.518
No!

01:28:44.699 --> 01:28:46.633
Victory is ours!

01:28:48.402 --> 01:28:49.562
Yeah!

01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:57.238
That's what I'm talking about!

01:28:57.311 --> 01:28:59.176
Yeah!

01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:06.485
I'd say somebody found his moxie.

01:29:08.589 --> 01:29:10.420
The Battle of the Smithsonian.

01:29:12.059 --> 01:29:15.460
Perhaps the greatest battle
the world will never know.

01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:19.163
We'll know.

01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:24.162
Yeah.

01:29:25.973 --> 01:29:28.771
Oh, man, I got an hour till sunrise.
I got to get you guys back.

01:29:28.843 --> 01:29:32.836
In case you forgot, Gigantor,
they don't want us there anymore.

01:29:32.947 --> 01:29:34.312
Well, I do.

01:29:37.985 --> 01:29:40.681
Hey, think you could hook us up
with a ride?

01:29:41.989 --> 01:29:43.820
My pleasure, of course.

01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:48.117
Hang on a second.
One last thing I got to take care of.

01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:52.031
Come on, boy! Come on, come on!

01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:53.961
Get in there!

01:29:56.837 --> 01:29:58.270
Feels good, right?

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:05.277
You're welcome!
Just get back inside by sunrise, okay?

01:30:19.026 --> 01:30:21.927
These are promising days, indeed.

01:30:45.086 --> 01:30:46.747
All right. Hey, come on, guys.

01:30:46.854 --> 01:30:49.914
Remember, stay with your buddy,
all right?

01:30:50.024 --> 01:30:51.389
Good, good.

01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:04.099
Well, you're back where you belong.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.037
Yeah. Think so.

01:31:14.849 --> 01:31:16.339
I guess I should be going.

01:31:18.753 --> 01:31:20.277
Hey, Amelia.

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:25.520
That thing that I was trying
to tell you about earlier...

01:31:28.362 --> 01:31:30.853
There's not really
an easy way to put this,

01:31:31.932 --> 01:31:35.959
- but, in the morning...
- I know what's coming, Mr. Daley.

01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:37.435
I've always known.

01:31:39.206 --> 01:31:40.901
But it doesn't matter.

01:31:40.975 --> 01:31:44.934
You've given me the adventure
of a lifetime in one night.

01:31:47.081 --> 01:31:50.482
And I have a feeling
it's going to be a beautiful sunrise.

01:31:58.826 --> 01:32:00.316
Have fun.

01:32:09.603 --> 01:32:10.934
Thanks.

01:33:02.156 --> 01:33:05.956
I don't know about you fellas, but
this old cowboy just got to second base.

01:33:08.863 --> 01:33:11.263
- There she goes.
- Straight towards...

01:33:12.833 --> 01:33:14.528
Canada.

01:33:15.536 --> 01:33:17.367
She's heading to Canada.

01:33:19.707 --> 01:33:21.675
No, now she course-corrected.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.611
Here, head on downstairs, guys.

01:33:27.681 --> 01:33:29.148
- All righty.
- Good night, Larry.

01:33:29.216 --> 01:33:30.683
Hey, boy, how's it going?

01:33:32.286 --> 01:33:35.050
Lawrence! Bless you
for bringing them back.

01:33:35.155 --> 01:33:37.851
And might I say,
a hearty well-done is in order.

01:33:37.958 --> 01:33:41.394
And may I also point out, they
cannot hide in the basement forever.

01:33:41.462 --> 01:33:43.089
Yeah. No, I think I got that
figured out.

01:33:43.163 --> 01:33:44.289
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:33:44.365 --> 01:33:46.162
Sun come, dum-dum.

01:33:47.167 --> 01:33:49.362
Our moai friend is right.
The dawn will soon be upon us.

01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:50.903
Hey, Teddy.

01:33:50.971 --> 01:33:52.461
Remember the other night
you were saying something

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.837
about the key to happiness?

01:33:53.908 --> 01:33:55.637
- Did I?
- You said, "The key to happiness is..."

01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:58.177
And then the sun came up and you froze.

01:33:58.245 --> 01:34:00.008
- I think I got it figured out.
- Yes?

01:34:00.514 --> 01:34:03.813
It's doing what you love, isn't it?
With people you love.

01:34:06.086 --> 01:34:07.917
Actually, I was going to say
"physical exercise",

01:34:08.022 --> 01:34:09.421
but the love thing's good, too.

01:34:15.162 --> 01:34:17.357
- Lawrence!
- Yeah.

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.361
Welcome home, son.

01:34:23.737 --> 01:34:25.170
Thanks.

01:34:40.087 --> 01:34:43.716
Well, folks, the wait is over.
After two months of renovation,

01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:47.522
tonight, The Museum of Natural History
reopens its doors to the public.

01:34:47.595 --> 01:34:49.961
As you can see,
New Yorkers are flooding in,

01:34:50.064 --> 01:34:52.589
eager to see
just what changes are in store.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.429
With its new, extended night hours,

01:34:54.535 --> 01:34:57.231
we're told the museum
will be more lively than ever.

01:35:06.246 --> 01:35:10.478
- Well, well, well, well!
- Hey.

01:35:11.318 --> 01:35:13.946
I see the uniform still fits
after these long, long years.

01:35:14.054 --> 01:35:16.420
Yeah, yeah.
Really hasn't been that long, but...

01:35:17.324 --> 01:35:21.283
So, to what do we owe
this "triumphant" return?

01:35:21.395 --> 01:35:24.831
Not cut out for the "corporate" jungle
after all. Got fired.

01:35:26.634 --> 01:35:29.603
No, actually, I sold my company.

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:32.639
The world doth move in mysterious ways.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.573
One day, we've got to get rid
of everything old,

01:35:35.643 --> 01:35:41.673
the next, a rich, anonymous donor
gives a huge endowment.

01:35:41.782 --> 01:35:45.741
With a proviso:
everything stays the same. So...

01:35:50.424 --> 01:35:52.790
- Well, not exactly the same, obviously.
- No.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.795
Bully, lads and ladies,
the name is Theodore Roosevelt,

01:35:55.863 --> 01:36:00.698
naturalist, Rough Rider and twenty-sixth
President of these great United States.

01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:04.293
Come along, lad. The hunt is afoot.
Lawrence.

01:36:09.843 --> 01:36:12.710
Hey, you dum-dums bring me gum-gum?

01:36:20.554 --> 01:36:23.887
My parents gave me this tablet
some 3,000 years ago,

01:36:23.991 --> 01:36:28.155
entrusting me with one of my people's
most prized possessions.

01:36:28.228 --> 01:36:31.061
- Does it do anything?
- Do anything?

01:36:31.165 --> 01:36:33.190
Yeah. What's the point
if it doesn't do anything?

01:36:34.334 --> 01:36:35.426
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:36:35.502 --> 01:36:40.030
Actually, it has a magical power
that brings all the exhibits to life.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.573
No, really, what's it do?

01:36:43.243 --> 01:36:45.734
Nothing. It's just for decoration.

01:36:45.846 --> 01:36:47.177
I knew it.

01:36:48.348 --> 01:36:52.216
This place is lame.
This thing doesn't even look real.

01:36:52.319 --> 01:36:55.413
Seriously, dude,
these animatronics suck.

01:37:04.898 --> 01:37:06.331
- Mammoth?
- Yeah.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.833
Extinct!

01:37:08.202 --> 01:37:10.568
- Today's technology is beyond me.
- I know. It's so lifelike.

01:37:10.671 --> 01:37:12.605
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Something else.

01:37:13.006 --> 01:37:14.837
You'll stick around
a bit longer this time,

01:37:14.908 --> 01:37:17.570
or you gonna run away again
when you get something better?

01:37:18.679 --> 01:37:20.112
- I'm gonna stay.
- Stay, for a long time.

01:37:20.214 --> 01:37:21.408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:37:22.049 --> 01:37:27.578
Good. 'Cause,
as night guards go, you're...

01:37:28.422 --> 01:37:30.686
- What?
- The best.

01:37:31.925 --> 01:37:33.517
Excuse me.

01:37:38.866 --> 01:37:41.096
You, the toddler!
Don't hug the displays.

01:38:17.805 --> 01:38:18.863
I'm sorry. Hi.

01:38:18.939 --> 01:38:20.930
I don't mean to stare. I just...

01:38:21.275 --> 01:38:24.472
You look a lot
like somebody I know, and...

01:38:25.245 --> 01:38:26.644
I get that a lot.

01:38:26.747 --> 01:38:30.274
- Do you?
- Yeah. I guess I have that kind of face.

01:38:30.984 --> 01:38:32.679
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

01:38:33.754 --> 01:38:36.746
You're not by any chance
related to Amelia Earhart, are you?

01:38:37.524 --> 01:38:38.923
- No.
- No.

01:38:38.992 --> 01:38:40.983
- No, I don't think so.
- Of course you're not.

01:38:41.094 --> 01:38:45.030
- I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm...
- I just had to ask. I'm sorry.

01:38:45.632 --> 01:38:49.124
She was that woman
who flew across the Pacific.

01:38:49.203 --> 01:38:51.034
- The Atlantic.
- Atlantic. Of course.

01:38:51.138 --> 01:38:53.629
First woman to fly across the Atlantic,
and she received the Flying Cross,

01:38:53.707 --> 01:38:55.299
first woman to do that.

01:38:56.043 --> 01:38:59.206
- That's very cool.
- Yeah, she was cool.

01:39:06.653 --> 01:39:10.214
Hey, you know what you should check out
is the the Hall of Miniatures.

01:39:11.892 --> 01:39:14.452
Could you take me there?
I'm always getting lost.

01:39:16.897 --> 01:39:20.856
Yeah, I know. Sure.
Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

01:39:21.501 --> 01:39:23.025
Thank you.

01:39:23.537 --> 01:39:25.698
- I'm Larry Daley.
- Tess.

01:40:00.774 --> 01:40:03.834
- Joseph, time for dinner!
- One second, Ma!

01:40:03.911 --> 01:40:08.109
Joey Motorola, you get down here
for supper right now!

01:40:08.215 --> 01:40:11.707
I said one second, Ma!
I really think I'm on to something here!
