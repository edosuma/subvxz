WEBVTT

00:01.896 --> 00:03.689
Previously on In Contempt.

00:03.827 --> 00:05.068
Ladies...

00:05.206 --> 00:07.413
Oh my lord!
You slept with him last night!

00:07.551 --> 00:09.655
Charlie doesn't like
anyone but himself.

00:09.793 --> 00:11.379
No.

00:11.517 --> 00:12.586
But if we cheat, we only bring
ourselves down to their level.

00:12.724 --> 00:13.931
What are you doing here exactly?

00:14.068 --> 00:15.551
You just slumped it
for a few months?

00:15.689 --> 00:16.724
I don'’t think this is
the right place for me.

00:16.862 --> 00:18.448
- What?
- Just imagining

00:18.586 --> 00:20.103
what it'’s gonna be like
to have you call me "boss".

00:20.241 --> 00:22.241
Cute! I call you
a lot of things, Charlie.

00:22.379 --> 00:24.172
Trust me, "boss"
ain't never gonna be one them.

00:24.310 --> 00:27.034
You rammed a guilty plea down
my client's throat yesterday.

00:27.172 --> 00:29.206
It makes me not want
to have sex with you.

00:29.379 --> 00:31.137
Dinner, a nice glass of red.

00:31.275 --> 00:33.206
Have I ever said no
to a nice glass of red?

00:33.344 --> 00:35.172
And he will be shadowing us
for the next few weeks

00:35.310 --> 00:36.517
for his latest project.

00:36.655 --> 00:38.000
Here's to old friends
reconnecting.

00:38.137 --> 00:39.379
I'll drink to that.

00:45.896 --> 00:48.551
Such a nice picture
for such a bad day.

00:48.862 --> 00:50.758
You sold your book,
it was a beautiful day.

00:50.896 --> 00:52.689
Yeah, I didn'’t get a chance

00:52.827 --> 00:54.689
to celebrate
the way I wanted to.

00:55.275 --> 00:56.758
Bit of champagne,

00:57.137 --> 00:58.827
but in a perfect world.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.172
I would have done this.

01:20.655 --> 01:22.689
Gwen, Gwen...

01:23.103 --> 01:24.275
Wake up!

01:25.482 --> 01:26.310
Oh my God.

01:27.793 --> 01:29.103
Was I drooling?

01:29.241 --> 01:31.068
Yes, you were.
And you were calling my name.

01:31.413 --> 01:33.000
I'’m just kidding.

01:33.137 --> 01:34.379
It sounded like you were having
a really good dream, though.

01:34.517 --> 01:35.965
I dreamed I paid off Sally Mae.

01:36.103 --> 01:39.413
Meeting time, Sugar.
Oh, hello, hotty professor.

01:39.551 --> 01:40.931
You coming to the staff meeting?

01:41.068 --> 01:42.793
I need to make
a few phone calls first.

01:42.965 --> 01:45.241
Splendid.
We will see you in there.

01:46.379 --> 01:48.655
Hey, you need to tell him.

01:48.793 --> 01:50.689
You need to give
my business back.

01:56.103 --> 01:58.068
Listen up, listen up!

01:59.517 --> 02:00.724
Kitson quit this morning.

02:00.862 --> 02:02.586
- What?
- Oh...

02:03.448 --> 02:05.448
All right, everybody,
let'’s have a moment of silence

02:05.586 --> 02:07.275
for another fallen brother.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.758
And so Lord,
we pray for the repose

02:10.896 --> 02:13.586
of public defender Raymond
Kitson who was struck down

02:13.724 --> 02:16.862
in his prime by the evils
of judicial indifference,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.034
institutional racism,

02:19.172 --> 02:22.000
and prosecutorial jackassery.

02:23.965 --> 02:24.965
Amen!

02:25.310 --> 02:27.655
Now you guys gotta
split up his felonies.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.172
- Oh...
- Oh...

02:30.517 --> 02:31.896
Is this chair broken?

02:32.172 --> 02:33.379
Gwen, Tracy.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.103
Kitson had a murder
on trial for today.

02:35.241 --> 02:36.413
- Gwen will take it.
- Tracy can take it.

02:36.551 --> 02:37.862
Oh, yeah?

02:38.689 --> 02:39.965
Oh, Halleluiah.

02:40.103 --> 02:41.758
Don'’t celebrate.
You're second chairing.

02:42.275 --> 02:43.310
Oh, great!

02:43.724 --> 02:45.344
A crack head
with a history of assault

02:45.482 --> 02:48.551
who is accused of knifing
his mother to death over money?

02:48.758 --> 02:51.379
Oh, look,
and there's a confession.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.068
Those are what we call
bad facts.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.931
This case is uglier
than homemade sin.

02:55.068 --> 02:56.793
No wonder Kitson quit.

02:56.931 --> 02:59.448
Let'’s just pray Judge Hernandez
will grant you a continuance.

03:03.275 --> 03:05.517
- Nice to see you.
- Oh my God, he's here.

03:07.482 --> 03:10.620
I still can'’t believe
that you know Bennet Thompson.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.034
I mean, Chance the Rapper

03:12.172 --> 03:13.965
was totes talking
about him on IG yesterday.

03:14.103 --> 03:15.827
Guys, this is Bennet Thompson.

03:16.034 --> 03:17.896
He is gonna shadow Gwen'’s case.

03:18.034 --> 03:19.965
And Vanessa,
you're with Charlie,

03:20.103 --> 03:21.724
catching an AP5 this week.

03:26.275 --> 03:29.482
Don'’t worry. I'’m totes sure
he didn'’t notice.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.482
- Kyle Jablonsky.
- Yeah? Where's Mr. Kitson?

03:37.620 --> 03:38.689
He's not
with our office anymore.

03:38.827 --> 03:39.724
We'll be representing you.

03:39.862 --> 03:41.137
Oh, come on!

03:41.862 --> 03:43.448
Damn it! I thought
we were starting today!

03:43.586 --> 03:45.034
OK, we have to get
an adjournment

03:45.172 --> 03:46.896
but it'll give us a chance
to get up to speed.

03:50.413 --> 03:52.517
Mr. Kitson did tell you
I didn'’t do it, right?

03:52.655 --> 03:53.965
We didn'’t have a chance
to talk to him.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.413
Sorry, guys, gotta go.

03:55.896 --> 03:57.068
I have an alibi.

03:57.206 --> 03:58.931
OK, we're still
reviewing everything.

04:00.896 --> 04:02.517
Mr. Kitson
just up and quit, Judge.

04:02.655 --> 04:04.344
I'’m asking for
a two week continuance.

04:04.482 --> 04:06.068
Your Honor, The People object.

04:06.206 --> 04:08.275
We're ready, our witnesses
are here just like last time.

04:08.413 --> 04:09.758
Oh, come on, Noreen,
you're gonna object?

04:09.896 --> 04:10.896
We just met the guy.

04:11.034 --> 04:12.379
Like you wouldn'’t do the same.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.206
I would consent to
two weeks if you'd just

04:14.344 --> 04:15.206
- gotten the case this morning--
- You would never consent--

04:15.344 --> 04:16.793
Ladies, enough.

04:16.931 --> 04:18.551
We all know neither of you
would consent to anything.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.689
Your request for
for a continuance is denied.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.068
Hearing's this afternoon.

04:22.206 --> 04:23.793
We'’ll pick the Jury
tomorrow morning.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.655
Judge, we literally met
our client two minutes ago!

04:25.793 --> 04:27.275
This is an old case.

04:27.413 --> 04:29.344
The officer is here
and Mr. Kitson jerked us around

04:29.482 --> 04:30.620
trying to work speedy trial.

04:30.758 --> 04:32.379
But judge,
we're new to this case--

04:32.517 --> 04:34.655
The longer you argue with me,
the less time you will have.

04:34.862 --> 04:36.206
Let'’s keep this moving.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.965
We all want to get out of here
at a decent hour.

04:38.241 --> 04:40.413
- She means happy hour.
- Excuse me?

04:40.586 --> 04:43.206
- Nothing, Your Honor.
- Nothing.

04:49.344 --> 04:50.517
What just happened?

04:50.655 --> 04:51.862
"Hang 'em high
Hernandez" happened.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.310
She used to be
a public defender.

04:53.448 --> 04:54.275
But now she's got her head
permanently stuck

04:54.413 --> 04:55.724
up the DA'’s ass.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.000
Judges are elected
and nobody gets re-elected

04:57.137 --> 04:58.724
by being pro-defendant.

04:58.862 --> 05:00.068
I'’m gonna go back to the office
and look at the tape.

05:00.206 --> 05:01.758
We'll grab lunch.
What do you want?

05:01.896 --> 05:03.379
- I'’m not hungry.
- Chicken salad sandwich it is.

05:03.517 --> 05:05.275
She doesn'’t eat
real food during trial.

05:05.551 --> 05:06.655
If I don'’t force feed her,

05:06.793 --> 05:08.379
she might actually starve
to death.

05:10.103 --> 05:12.137
AP5 is where
the misdemeanors live.

05:12.275 --> 05:15.310
It'’s like 125th Street
in Harlem back in the day.

05:15.724 --> 05:16.793
You gotta wheel and deal.

05:16.931 --> 05:18.931
It'’s all about speed.

05:19.724 --> 05:21.000
Catching means covering cases

05:21.137 --> 05:22.586
for other lawyers
that can'’t be here.

05:22.724 --> 05:24.310
It'’s all about negotiation.
Do not beg.

05:24.448 --> 05:26.551
Remember, you have something
that the prosecutor wants.

05:26.689 --> 05:29.241
A guilty plea. If a guy is out,
he stays out, no jail time.

05:29.379 --> 05:31.379
It's community service,
at worst probation.

05:31.517 --> 05:33.275
Shoplifts are two days
community service.

05:33.413 --> 05:36.000
Hopping a turn style is a fine.
You getting all this?

05:36.137 --> 05:38.724
Eh... Almost. Can you just
start from the beginning?

05:40.344 --> 05:42.655
You got guys in holding cells
and guys who are out.

05:42.793 --> 05:44.862
Look at the docket
when your case is in order

05:45.000 --> 05:46.517
and stay ahead of the call.

05:47.344 --> 05:48.655
Just watch.

05:50.068 --> 05:53.275
Hey, Gale,
our No. 33, we're gonna do a CD

05:53.413 --> 05:54.896
and one day
of Community Service.

05:55.034 --> 05:58.103
Our 72 is an ACD and a fine.
You pick the price.

05:58.241 --> 06:00.448
And 21 has no
supporting deposition,

06:00.586 --> 06:02.896
- so he's going home today.
- I don'’t know about 21.

06:03.034 --> 06:06.034
I'm offering you two pleas
and your hands are tied on 21.

06:06.379 --> 06:07.586
OK.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.172
Boom! That'’s how we do it.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.517
Harkin! Yareve! Foley!

06:14.034 --> 06:16.241
Remember, don'’t beg, negotiate

06:16.379 --> 06:18.413
- Wait! I'm--
- You got this!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.344
- Hey, boss!
- Hey.

06:20.482 --> 06:21.620
To what do we owe the pleasure?

06:21.758 --> 06:23.241
I'm watching, listening.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.241
Call it a performance review.

06:25.379 --> 06:28.413
- She'll do great.
- Not her... You.

06:28.965 --> 06:31.758
Then prepare to watch
the MJ of your team ball out.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.827
I'’m waiting.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.172
The People vs. Erin Koru.

06:37.862 --> 06:39.931
- What is this place?
- Our clothes closet.

06:40.068 --> 06:41.586
We keep a collection
of dresses and suits

06:41.724 --> 06:43.206
for clients who go to trial.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.827
It makes a better impression
than their baggy sweats

06:44.965 --> 06:46.551
and wife beaters.

06:46.965 --> 06:49.827
It is also Gwen'’s
fight the power work space.

06:50.103 --> 06:51.310
What'’s the smell? Smells like...

06:51.448 --> 06:52.862
Dirty socks,
pumpkin spice candles

06:53.000 --> 06:54.172
- and potato chips.
- Oh...

06:54.310 --> 06:56.482
This interrogation is so foul.

06:56.655 --> 06:58.103
The sneaker prints, Kyle!

06:58.517 --> 07:00.793
The ones by the broken window,
where the killer broke in.

07:01.517 --> 07:03.379
The treads match
your sneakers exactly!

07:03.517 --> 07:05.551
Now, that'’s lie number one,
the sneaker prints don'’t match.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.413
You're allowed
to lie to the suspect.

07:07.551 --> 07:09.034
Yeah, but just watch.

07:09.172 --> 07:10.448
We'’ve got the results
of your polygraph.

07:10.689 --> 07:13.689
The spike here
says you're lying.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.103
No. It can'’t be.

07:16.241 --> 07:18.655
Lie number two, the lie
detector test was inconclusive.

07:18.793 --> 07:20.448
You were high, OK?

07:20.586 --> 07:22.034
You broke into your
mother'’s house to steal money,

07:22.172 --> 07:23.586
which you had done
before, Kyle.

07:23.724 --> 07:24.862
OK, you got into
an argument with her.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.413
And that'’s when you stabbed her.

07:26.551 --> 07:28.517
No! I swear to God,
I was with Alana.

07:28.655 --> 07:30.413
Here comes lie number three.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.758
'Cause we spoke with Alana,
she said you weren't with her.

07:31.896 --> 07:34.068
- I was!
- That's a lie.

07:35.793 --> 07:37.724
This went on for 19 hours.

07:37.862 --> 07:39.137
So what's your next move?

07:39.275 --> 07:41.241
Alana, she's
a delightful stripper friend

07:41.379 --> 07:42.689
and probably a drug buddy.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.724
The cops picked her up
but she refused to talk.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.068
Kitson never talked to her?

07:46.206 --> 07:47.379
Kitson was never the same after

07:47.517 --> 07:49.000
that second avenue
murder trial.

07:49.137 --> 07:51.241
Surprised he didn't
check out earlier.

07:51.517 --> 07:53.517
I didn't kill my mother.

07:54.413 --> 07:55.655
Please...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.068
I thought it was just
another annoying guilty client

07:58.206 --> 07:59.862
proclaiming his innocence
but now I'm thinking

08:00.000 --> 08:01.793
that he actually
might be innocent.

08:02.206 --> 08:04.103
Please... I didn'’t kill her.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.517
- Alana?
- Who wants to know?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.275
I'm Gwen Sullivan, I'’m
a public defender and this is...

08:12.413 --> 08:14.482
You work at
the Wild Rhino Club, right?

08:17.551 --> 08:19.137
Can we come in?

08:20.862 --> 08:22.689
Ma, it's friends from work.

08:22.827 --> 08:24.931
Can you watch your judge
shows in the back?

08:38.482 --> 08:40.241
My mom never knew
I stripped, either.

08:40.379 --> 08:41.689
Pink stiletto and panties.

08:41.827 --> 08:44.379
- You stripped?
- Paid for law school.

08:45.379 --> 08:46.689
Pinks, huh?

08:47.241 --> 08:48.448
Who worked the door?

08:48.724 --> 08:50.586
Fat Irish dude with ear hair.

08:50.758 --> 08:52.103
- Called him "“The Choker"”.
- Choker?

08:52.448 --> 08:55.034
He always beat the shit out of
anyone copping a feel.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.482
Oh yeah.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.172
Well, The Good Book says
don'’t get drunk off wine,

08:58.310 --> 09:00.103
but it says nothing
about liquor, so bottoms up.

09:06.344 --> 09:07.482
Look, Alana,

09:07.620 --> 09:08.896
Kyle's in serious trouble

09:09.034 --> 09:10.275
and we need to know
if he was with you

09:10.413 --> 09:12.310
the day his mother was killed.

09:15.379 --> 09:17.241
I don'’t know nothing, sorry.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.758
How long has your man
been in prison?

09:25.620 --> 09:26.896
Four years.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.206
How'd you know?

09:31.034 --> 09:32.620
His says "“together"”, right?

09:33.517 --> 09:34.896
I have a brother in the system.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.586
Robbery.

09:36.724 --> 09:39.931
I don'’t get to see him often
and I really miss him a lot.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.000
Kyle and me were partying.

09:55.827 --> 09:57.517
He'’s always got
the good stuff, you know?

09:57.689 --> 09:59.551
Was he with you
the whole afternoon?

09:59.689 --> 10:00.758
Yeah.

10:01.206 --> 10:03.172
I remember 'cause
I had to go to work at five,

10:03.310 --> 10:04.586
he left with me.

10:06.275 --> 10:07.931
Are you willing to testify?

10:19.517 --> 10:21.137
and how do you know Choker
with the ear hair?

10:21.275 --> 10:22.758
I really was a stripper.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.965
A client! I visited her
a couple of times at work.

10:27.103 --> 10:28.896
And good on you
for noticing her tab.

10:29.034 --> 10:30.896
You're a class A liar yourself.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.034
Your brother's not in prison
for robbery.

10:33.172 --> 10:36.758
Well, burglary didn't sound
glamorous enough.

10:36.896 --> 10:39.310
- I don'’t think he did it.
- Doesn'’t seem so.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.206
But how are we even
gonna get her on the stand?

10:41.344 --> 10:42.896
Kitson didn't serve
the alibi notice.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.448
You'’ll think of something, Gwen.

10:44.586 --> 10:47.206
You always do,
just take a breath.

10:48.310 --> 10:52.034
Honey, this isn'’t gonna be
another Lockhart, OK?

10:52.379 --> 10:53.689
I hope not.

10:54.793 --> 10:56.517
'Cause I don'’t think
I can take it.

10:59.482 --> 11:01.206
I need an expert
to explain to the Jury

11:01.344 --> 11:02.586
how false confessions happen.

11:02.724 --> 11:04.379
Juries understands
the concept of coercion.

11:04.517 --> 11:05.827
You don'’t need an expert.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.517
They understand being
beaten or tortured.

11:07.655 --> 11:10.000
They don'’t understand
psychological coercion.

11:10.344 --> 11:11.931
Judge, the detectives
used something

11:12.068 --> 11:14.068
called the "“Re-technique"”
to interrogate Jablonsky.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.620
Most police department's use it.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.586
It'’s a very specific
three-step process.

11:17.724 --> 11:19.172
First, the police
break someone down.

11:19.310 --> 11:20.758
They interrogate him
for hours and hours

11:20.896 --> 11:22.379
and make him believe
that nothing he says

11:23.758 --> 11:25.172
Then they make him
feel hopeless.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.896
Here they told Mr. Jablonsky
he failed the polygraph.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.586
And then they threatened him
with him death penalty.

11:28.724 --> 11:31.344
And then they offer him
a way out... A confession.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.413
An expert is going to give
her expert opinion

11:33.551 --> 11:35.068
that the confession was coerced.

11:35.206 --> 11:36.620
She is going to take
the issue from the Jury--

11:36.758 --> 11:38.448
No, she's not.
She just gonna explain

11:38.586 --> 11:40.034
the psychologically
of how it could happen.

11:40.172 --> 11:41.586
We're just asking
for a Frye hearing, Judge.

11:41.724 --> 11:42.862
OK, enough.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.379
Jurors are
completely able to draw

11:44.517 --> 11:46.103
on their own life experiences
in determining--

11:46.241 --> 11:48.413
Judge, everyone believes
they would never confess

11:48.551 --> 11:49.896
to something that
they didn't do.

11:50.034 --> 11:51.862
And you are free to question
the detectives--

11:52.000 --> 11:53.931
But the detectives don'’t think
they did anything wrong.

11:54.068 --> 11:56.275
And you are free to argue
the coercion issue--

11:56.413 --> 11:58.758
You know that's not
as effective--

11:58.896 --> 12:01.137
Why do you keep
interrupting me?

12:02.413 --> 12:04.655
Now, is there anything else?

12:04.793 --> 12:07.379
Yes, the Prosecution has
turned over a witness list.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.103
I'’d like a proffer of
the witness testimony.

12:09.241 --> 12:11.344
I don'’t owe the defense
a road map to my case.

12:11.482 --> 12:12.793
You don'’t owe me a road map.

12:12.931 --> 12:14.689
But you do have to
demonstrate relevance.

12:14.827 --> 12:17.620
But she doesn'’t have to do it
before the witness testifies.

12:17.758 --> 12:19.965
We're moving on,
bring in the Jury.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.413
If I tell you. Will you stop?

12:22.586 --> 12:25.482
Kyle, just admit what you did,
that'’s all we're asking,

12:25.620 --> 12:26.793
just admit it!

12:27.586 --> 12:30.448
You're not leaving here, Kyle,
till you tell us what you did!

12:30.586 --> 12:32.275
Fine, fine.

12:36.413 --> 12:37.586
I killed her.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.137
I broke in...

12:41.862 --> 12:44.655
She wouldn'’t
give me the money, so I...

12:44.931 --> 12:46.586
I stabbed her.

12:47.965 --> 12:49.655
Just like you said.

12:52.655 --> 12:54.655
After the defendant confessed,

12:55.172 --> 12:57.000
did you uncover
any additional evidence?

12:57.137 --> 13:00.793
I found out he had a combative
relationship with his mother.

13:01.275 --> 13:03.448
And I found out
he was a drug addict

13:03.586 --> 13:05.551
who stole money
from her in the past.

13:05.758 --> 13:07.413
What about forensic evidence?

13:07.551 --> 13:10.413
The defendant'’s fingerprints
were on the knife.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.551
The bloody shoe prints
were the same size and shape

13:13.793 --> 13:15.137
as the defendant'’s shoes.

13:15.793 --> 13:19.034
And of course, the victim'’s
blood was on his clothes.

13:19.172 --> 13:21.413
All of which confirmed
his confession.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.517
Let'’s put it in this way,

13:23.655 --> 13:27.034
I have no doubt in my mind
we'’ve got the right guy.

13:33.586 --> 13:36.068
Detective, someone who came
upon the crime scene

13:36.206 --> 13:38.482
and tried to help
could have touched the knife

13:38.620 --> 13:41.137
- and tracked the blood around.
- Yes.

13:41.275 --> 13:43.931
Fair to say, most people who
have difficult relationships

13:44.068 --> 13:45.827
with their mothers
don'’t kill them.

13:46.275 --> 13:47.413
He confessed.

13:47.551 --> 13:50.448
You interrogated him
for 19 hours.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.965
You lied to him
about failing the polygraph.

13:54.413 --> 13:56.310
You lied to him
about the sneaker prints

13:56.448 --> 13:57.931
being an exact match.

13:58.068 --> 14:01.034
Counselor, would you confess
to killing your mother

14:01.172 --> 14:02.689
if you really hadn'’t?

14:03.206 --> 14:04.482
Would any of you?

14:14.413 --> 14:16.655
- What are you doing?
- Motion-free AP5.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.896
We don'’t do motions in AP5.

14:19.448 --> 14:21.034
You don'’t do motions in AP5.

14:21.172 --> 14:22.827
I'’m a graduate
of Yale Law School

14:22.965 --> 14:25.931
and a Caldwell fellow,
I do motions in AP5.

14:26.586 --> 14:27.724
OK.

14:53.344 --> 14:54.482
What is she doing?

14:54.620 --> 14:56.241
It'’s her process.

14:57.655 --> 14:59.620
- Is that healthy?
- Nope.

14:59.758 --> 15:01.413
But try taking them
away from her,

15:01.551 --> 15:03.655
- you might pull back a nub.
- I can hear you, you know.

15:03.793 --> 15:05.965
Judge Hernandez was pretty
angry with you over the expert,

15:06.103 --> 15:07.724
why bring out
the witness list now?

15:07.862 --> 15:10.000
Better to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

15:10.137 --> 15:11.965
- We can hear you.
- Hey!

15:12.206 --> 15:13.931
- I have a master plan.
- What?

15:14.103 --> 15:15.517
I don'’t know,
but I'’m on the verge.

15:15.655 --> 15:17.034
Well, you're gonna have to
convince a jury

15:17.172 --> 15:18.827
how somebody
can falsely confess, right?

15:18.965 --> 15:20.931
That is the dilemma.

15:22.551 --> 15:23.862
I got it!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.448
Sugar, I live with her.

15:29.344 --> 15:30.689
We can'’t play the full

15:30.827 --> 15:32.724
19-hour interrogation tape
with no breaks.

15:32.862 --> 15:34.206
Your Honor,
I didn'’t say with no breaks.

15:34.344 --> 15:36.034
I said under
simulated conditions.

15:36.172 --> 15:38.379
We need to put them through
what Mr. Jubonsky went through.

15:38.517 --> 15:40.137
It'’s a ridiculous proposal.

15:40.275 --> 15:42.103
Judge, the detective asked the
Jurors if they would confess

15:42.241 --> 15:43.586
to killing their mother
if they hadn'’t.

15:43.724 --> 15:45.068
Nobody thinks they would.

15:45.206 --> 15:47.448
The fact remains
that it happens all the time,

15:47.586 --> 15:49.620
this is the only way
for us to show them how.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.551
Are you sure about this?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.448
The jury might end up
hating you

15:53.586 --> 15:55.344
or they won't get it
and you'll just confirm

15:55.482 --> 15:57.620
- the prosecutions argument.
- What other choice do we have?

15:57.758 --> 16:00.241
Your Honor, you can'’t
possibly be considering this.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.137
I'’m going to allow it.

16:02.275 --> 16:03.793
How could you allow
something so ridiculous--

16:03.931 --> 16:06.137
It'’s either this
or the expert, Miss Nasser.

16:06.275 --> 16:07.758
Which do you prefer?

16:11.689 --> 16:13.413
I'’m tired,
can we just take a break?

16:13.551 --> 16:14.655
We'll take a break
when you start

16:14.793 --> 16:16.172
telling us the truth, Kyle.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.724
- I am telling you--
- No, you're not!

16:18.275 --> 16:21.172
What do you want me to say?
I'’ve already told you.

16:21.655 --> 16:23.793
Kyle, just tell us the truth,
man, please.

16:23.931 --> 16:27.000
I did, I'm with Alana,
we get high,

16:27.137 --> 16:29.758
I... I go back
to her place and then...

16:30.344 --> 16:31.758
I don'’t know, we passed out.

16:31.896 --> 16:35.344
I wake up,
I go to my mom'’s and...

16:36.620 --> 16:38.172
She's just lying there...

16:38.586 --> 16:41.586
My B.S. meter
is off the scale with you.

16:42.482 --> 16:45.206
Do you think this is a game
or something?

16:45.344 --> 16:47.586
I don'’t know
how else to tell you.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.241
Listen,
you're not going anywhere

16:49.379 --> 16:50.724
until you tell us
what we want to hear.

16:50.931 --> 16:53.310
So you might just start going.

16:53.448 --> 16:55.172
Yeah, just talk.

16:56.551 --> 16:58.068
We'’re not going anywhere, Kyle.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.206
Listen, OK, if you confess,

17:05.620 --> 17:07.862
the Judge will take your
cooperation into account.

17:08.241 --> 17:11.068
That way, the death penalty
will be off the table, Kyle.

17:11.206 --> 17:14.379
Please, please stop.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.034
God, I can'’t take this anymore!

17:16.172 --> 17:18.137
- Mr. Grennan, sit down.
- This is ridiculous--

17:18.275 --> 17:20.448
You'd have said anything to get
out of here, wouldn't you?

17:20.586 --> 17:22.000
- Objection!
- Would you make up a lie?

17:22.137 --> 17:23.517
Yes, I would,
as a matter of fact!

17:23.655 --> 17:24.689
Objection! Your Honor!

17:24.827 --> 17:26.827
- Miss Sullivan.
- Your Honor!

17:27.517 --> 17:29.103
Clear the courtroom now!

17:38.344 --> 17:40.034
Counselors approach.

17:45.310 --> 17:46.896
Are you out of your mind?

17:47.034 --> 17:49.172
Judge, I'm sorry, I was tired,
probably as tired as he was.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.793
Everybody, shut up!

17:51.620 --> 17:52.896
Here's what going to happen.

17:53.034 --> 17:54.724
I'’m going to dismiss
Juror number 5

17:54.862 --> 17:56.379
and seat a replacement.

17:56.551 --> 17:57.931
Any objection?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.517
We're adjourned for the night.

18:09.862 --> 18:11.827
Whatever you do,
don'’t call her Gale.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.344
I got this.

18:14.068 --> 18:15.310
Hey, Gale.

18:16.206 --> 18:17.448
Miss Hunter.

18:17.586 --> 18:20.586
Um... About number 28,
Toby Boyd,

18:20.862 --> 18:22.862
- Which one is 28?
- The public nudity.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.965
How about 250 dollar fine,
no community service?

18:27.103 --> 18:28.620
Do I look
like Santa Clause to you?

18:28.758 --> 18:30.172
No, but...

18:30.310 --> 18:32.000
It's ten days community service,
take it or leave it.

18:32.517 --> 18:35.068
- How about...
- How about you go away now?

18:37.172 --> 18:38.551
Bye bye.

18:42.551 --> 18:44.206
Your rookie
is crashing and burning.

18:44.344 --> 18:46.068
I don'’t believe
in helicopter parenting, Tom.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.310
She'’s gonna learn
coming to me with questions.

18:48.448 --> 18:49.655
Tough love.

18:50.241 --> 18:53.068
I'’m telling you,
they are not gonna reverse.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.862
I'’m on solid ground.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.172
I have half a mind to--

18:57.482 --> 18:58.586
Jesus!

18:58.931 --> 19:01.137
Excuse me, I forgot something
in my office.

19:09.448 --> 19:12.000
The defense calls
Alana Martin to the stand.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.206
Alana Martin!

19:17.620 --> 19:19.482
Your Honor, may we approach?

19:25.379 --> 19:27.344
I'’d like a proffer as to
this witness testimony.

19:27.482 --> 19:29.206
Oh, Miss Nasser
stated yesterday,

19:29.344 --> 19:32.000
and I quote "“I don'’t owe
you a road map to my case"”.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.965
You then ruled that she
didn't need to demonstrate

19:34.103 --> 19:36.034
relevance before
the witness testified.

19:36.172 --> 19:37.689
She'’s got you there,
Miss Nasser.

19:37.827 --> 19:39.379
You may proceed, Miss Sullivan.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.724
Miss Martin, how do you
know Mr. Jablonsky?

19:43.862 --> 19:45.000
We're friends.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.103
- You do drugs together?
- Yes.

19:47.241 --> 19:49.965
Can you tell me about
the afternoon of May 5th?

19:50.310 --> 19:52.000
- Kyle was with me--
- Objection!

19:52.137 --> 19:53.482
- We were doing drugs together--
- Are you kidding me?

19:53.620 --> 19:55.517
Miss Martin, stop talking!

19:55.827 --> 19:57.137
Approach!

20:00.310 --> 20:02.206
Your Honor, the defense
has sandbagged this court.

20:02.344 --> 20:05.034
We served 250.20 notice.
They had eight days to respond.

20:05.172 --> 20:06.551
You'’d better have
a good excuse for this.

20:06.689 --> 20:08.206
The police already knew
Mr. Jablonsky said

20:08.344 --> 20:10.000
he was with Miss Martin.
They had notice.

20:10.137 --> 20:11.793
Then why set me up
with the witness list?

20:11.931 --> 20:14.206
- Judge, I want sanctions.
- I'’m going to instruct the Jury

20:14.344 --> 20:16.206
to disregard
Miss Martin'’s testimony.

20:16.344 --> 20:17.862
I'’m also going to instruct them

20:18.000 --> 20:20.034
that Mr. Jablonsky, in fact,
does not have an alibi.

20:20.172 --> 20:21.551
You can'’t give that instruction.

20:21.689 --> 20:22.965
That'’s like telling
the Jury to convict.

20:23.103 --> 20:24.758
- Oh, but I can.
- This is a murder trial.

20:24.896 --> 20:26.482
You are letting technicalities
get in the way of the truth.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.172
These technicalities,
Miss Sullivan, are the law.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.758
Ladies and gentleman
of the Jury,

20:32.068 --> 20:35.379
I am instructing you to ignore
the testimony you just heard.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.034
I am further instructing you

20:37.172 --> 20:39.310
that any consideration
of an alibi defense

20:39.448 --> 20:41.206
would be unsupported
by the evidence.

20:41.344 --> 20:43.034
What?
I was with her, Your Honor.

20:43.172 --> 20:45.965
Mr. Jablonsky, that'’s enough.
We'’ll take a recess.

20:46.482 --> 20:47.724
What is our move?

20:47.862 --> 20:50.448
Jesus, we're getting screwed
at every turn.

20:50.586 --> 20:52.586
We have no move,
what is our move?

20:53.275 --> 20:56.689
It was a bad confession,
he's got his own alibi.

20:57.068 --> 20:58.482
The burden's on us now.

20:59.103 --> 21:01.551
We need to point the finger.
We needed a suspect.

21:02.068 --> 21:03.724
We need another suspect,
OK, wait.

21:04.103 --> 21:06.137
Kyle, we need you to think.
Is there anyone else

21:06.275 --> 21:07.379
who could have done this
to your mother?

21:07.517 --> 21:08.655
Yeah, Ryan Hooper.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.413
I kept telling that
to Mr. Kitson.

21:10.551 --> 21:12.206
- Ryan Hooper, I know that name.
- Yes, he's another tweaker.

21:12.344 --> 21:14.448
My mother'’s friend told me
that he came by the house

21:14.586 --> 21:16.413
asking to borrow money
the day before she was killed.

21:16.551 --> 21:18.068
The cops interviewed him
and said he had

21:18.206 --> 21:19.482
- no motive and no record.
- That'’s bullshit.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.000
We were arrested together
a few times.

21:21.137 --> 21:23.068
He's in prison
right now for a robbery

21:23.206 --> 21:24.551
he did a month
after my mom was killed.

21:24.689 --> 21:26.344
OK, I'll get
an investigator on it.

21:26.482 --> 21:27.965
You find out
what prison he's in.

21:28.103 --> 21:31.000
Kyle, you stay strong, OK?

21:37.103 --> 21:38.379
You guys OK?

21:38.551 --> 21:40.655
- Not really.
- This is a disaster.

21:40.793 --> 21:43.379
- Maybe not, juror number five.
- Could have been a one off,

21:43.517 --> 21:46.000
we have no idea what the other
Jurors thought about the tape.

21:48.379 --> 21:49.448
What'’s that?

21:49.586 --> 21:50.827
Just a delicious,

21:50.965 --> 21:53.344
refreshing, healthier option
than a flambeau.

21:55.862 --> 21:57.689
Oh, you're serious.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.758
You need to relax.

22:00.137 --> 22:01.448
You know what, you're right.

22:01.586 --> 22:02.724
But not like that.

22:10.482 --> 22:12.310
- Not too bad.
- I know, you're not either.

22:12.448 --> 22:14.517
Form's a little stiff but with
a little practice, you know,

22:14.655 --> 22:16.068
we'll work on that.

22:16.206 --> 22:17.206
Oh, you know what's stiff?
You in the court room,

22:17.344 --> 22:18.758
that's what's stiff, yeah.

22:18.896 --> 22:19.965
Thought you was
better than that?

22:20.103 --> 22:22.413
Oh, oh, oh, oh, OK!

22:24.827 --> 22:26.206
Yeah, maybe I
was too optimistic

22:26.344 --> 22:28.172
about you getting better,
you know.

22:28.379 --> 22:29.517
Ooh, OK!

22:29.655 --> 22:31.310
- How's that feel?
- That feels good.

22:31.448 --> 22:32.793
You make sure
you keep those hands up,

22:32.931 --> 22:34.344
keep those elbows
on those front ribs.

22:34.482 --> 22:36.379
Gwen, I think I know
a little bit about boxing.

22:36.517 --> 22:37.793
Oh, do you?

22:39.344 --> 22:40.620
I'm sorry about your jaw.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.172
I barely felt it.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.344
Hey, you still with me?

22:49.103 --> 22:51.862
Yeah, I was just thinking
about Floyd Lockhart.

22:53.517 --> 22:54.793
That'’s a client?

22:54.931 --> 22:57.137
Yeah, he was Golden Gloves
champion at 19.

22:57.931 --> 23:00.275
The guy didn't have much
going on in his life, but...

23:00.793 --> 23:02.551
God, he loved
that diamond belt.

23:03.310 --> 23:04.827
He was convicted
of a robbery/homicide

23:04.965 --> 23:06.758
outside of a gentleman's club
and all the evidence

23:06.896 --> 23:08.206
pointed to a BS case.

23:08.344 --> 23:10.965
It was a shady line up,
withheld evidence,

23:11.344 --> 23:12.827
jailhouse informant.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.517
Case should have been
open and shut and I...

23:16.827 --> 23:18.275
I dunno how I lost it.

23:19.551 --> 23:24.448
He got 25 years for a crime
I know he didn'’t commit.

23:27.758 --> 23:30.137
And I kept thinking
that I see him in the street.

23:31.172 --> 23:33.241
I see a taxi driver
or a bike messenger

23:33.379 --> 23:35.000
that looks like him.

23:35.793 --> 23:37.448
I think, "“Oh my God!"”

23:38.827 --> 23:40.827
Floyd somehow won his appeal.

23:42.137 --> 23:43.517
He would always say,

23:44.620 --> 23:49.344
"“People have no idea how long
15 rounds truly are...

23:49.793 --> 23:51.241
Till they're in the ring."

23:53.482 --> 23:54.931
Floyd was a fighter.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.586
So are you.

24:01.965 --> 24:03.586
Let'’s go one more round.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.172
Dark and white chocolate.

24:18.344 --> 24:19.862
Well, someone must have
ordered us to go,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.034
'cause we're the flavors
that get to go home tonight.

24:23.551 --> 24:26.379
Now that that's out of the way,
we're Kyle Jublonksy's lawyers.

24:26.586 --> 24:27.931
You just started
a ten year sentence

24:28.068 --> 24:29.206
for assault and robbery,

24:29.344 --> 24:30.413
you stabbed someone
with a knife.

24:30.586 --> 24:31.965
Maybe I did, maybe I didn'’t.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.551
Lupita Jablonsky, Kyle'’s mom,

24:34.689 --> 24:36.206
was that a robbery
gone wrong, too?

24:36.344 --> 24:38.827
Sorry, no se habla
assault and robbery.

24:38.965 --> 24:40.655
You really want to play
the asshole right now?

24:40.793 --> 24:42.965
I will play whatever you want.

24:43.137 --> 24:46.137
I bet you are a wild
African beast in bed.

24:46.275 --> 24:48.137
Actually, I'’m not the beast.
She is.

24:49.517 --> 24:52.172
I'’m from Queens, so I know half
of the guards in this prison.

24:52.310 --> 24:53.896
And as a favor
to a neighborhood girl

24:54.034 --> 24:56.103
they'’ll be happy
to look the other way

24:56.241 --> 24:58.724
when another inmate
makes you his bitch.

25:01.206 --> 25:04.620
OK, so where were you at the
time of Mrs. Jablonsky'’s death?

25:04.758 --> 25:06.172
I was in a bar.

25:06.724 --> 25:08.206
You know what, forget about it,
we're outta here.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.724
OK, wait, wait, alright.

25:09.896 --> 25:11.206
I was at Shambleys, OK,

25:11.344 --> 25:13.448
I got there around 1,
I left around 3:30.

25:13.586 --> 25:16.206
So there ain't no way I could
have killed that old lady.

25:16.379 --> 25:18.482
That is a pretty specific
time frame

25:18.827 --> 25:20.931
and I never told you
what time she was killed.

25:24.517 --> 25:27.620
Miss Sullivan, in order to
argue third party culpability,

25:27.758 --> 25:29.413
you have to show
this Ryan Hooper

25:29.551 --> 25:30.758
had a motive and opportunity.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.068
In addition to
harassing the victim

25:32.206 --> 25:33.586
the day before her murder,

25:33.724 --> 25:35.344
he has a long history
of assault and robbery.

25:35.482 --> 25:38.862
- No, actually, he doesn'’t.
- Yes, actually, he does.

25:39.103 --> 25:41.275
Judge, the detectives
released him as a suspect

25:41.413 --> 25:43.517
partly because his rap sheet
said he had no priors

25:43.655 --> 25:45.586
but, they ran wrong birth date.

25:45.827 --> 25:49.758
They ran 5/17/89,
he was born on 6/17/89.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.586
Having a sheet
doesn'’t make him a murderer.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.620
And we checked out
his alleged alibi.

25:53.758 --> 25:55.689
The cameras
at the bar he said he was

25:55.827 --> 25:57.000
don'’t show him coming or going.

25:57.137 --> 25:58.482
Your Honor, the law is clear.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.137
They have to demonstrate
a legitimate tendency

26:00.275 --> 26:01.586
that Ryan Hooper
committed the crime.

26:01.724 --> 26:03.344
Otherwise
they can present 100 people

26:03.482 --> 26:05.482
- with the slightest motive.
- Counselor, she's right.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.379
All you've done
is raise a bare suspicion.

26:07.517 --> 26:09.137
Judge,
this is getting to be absurd.

26:09.275 --> 26:11.655
I mean, first you made us
try this case with no prep,

26:11.793 --> 26:13.241
then you hamstrung us
on the expert,

26:13.379 --> 26:14.724
then you hammered us
on the alibi.

26:14.862 --> 26:16.931
- You hammered yourself.
- Shut up, Noreen.

26:17.068 --> 26:19.655
Miss Sullivan,
when I was a public defender,

26:19.793 --> 26:21.758
I would flout
the rules like you do.

26:21.896 --> 26:25.068
But I can'’t do that anymore,
I have to protect the process.

26:25.206 --> 26:26.931
Even it means
convicting an innocent man?

26:27.068 --> 26:29.000
You think he is innocent.
They don'’t.

26:29.137 --> 26:30.724
I'’ve made my ruling.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.137
I'm so stupid,

26:36.275 --> 26:37.896
I thought 'cause I'm innocent
everything would be OK.

26:39.655 --> 26:42.137
Who would believe that I
actually killed my own mother?

26:43.551 --> 26:44.896
My mother!

26:48.517 --> 26:50.103
If I hadn't been an addict,
I could have been there

26:50.241 --> 26:51.896
for that day,
she'd still be alive.

26:52.034 --> 26:54.172
Kyle, do not do that
to yourself.

27:03.206 --> 27:05.896
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in prison.

27:24.758 --> 27:26.172
Seriously?

27:26.310 --> 27:27.931
You're as broke as a baby
racking up credit card debt

27:28.068 --> 27:30.931
and you're late with the bills,
you have go to stop this.

27:33.172 --> 27:34.586
We're losing.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.413
Shit! I'’m sorry, honey.

27:40.965 --> 27:42.241
Look...

27:43.620 --> 27:46.793
We drew a bad hand,
it's not your fault.

27:47.931 --> 27:50.310
I just, I hate this feeling.

27:51.206 --> 27:52.517
It feels like Floyd.

27:52.655 --> 27:54.068
Oh, baby!

27:55.241 --> 27:56.793
That wasn'’t your fault, either.

27:56.931 --> 27:58.137
Bullshit!

27:58.275 --> 28:01.965
You gotta learn to embrace
that C-world. OK?

28:02.965 --> 28:04.862
Compartmentalize.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.137
We need a rabbit.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.000
We sure do.

28:22.206 --> 28:24.448
I promise I will pay it
tomorrow.

28:35.896 --> 28:37.482
Cases up for motions.

28:46.310 --> 28:49.241
The defense'’s motion to dismiss
for facial insufficiency

28:49.379 --> 28:50.724
is denied.

28:53.793 --> 28:55.724
Your Honor, to make out
a claim of harassment,

28:55.862 --> 28:58.586
the prosecution has to allege
repeated instances of conduct,

28:58.724 --> 29:00.206
they've only alleged one.

29:00.793 --> 29:02.689
The motion is denied.

29:05.862 --> 29:08.275
Your Honor,
it is a 20-page motion.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.103
Perhaps you need
a little more time to read it?

29:10.275 --> 29:13.413
- An adjournment--
- Counselor, I said denied.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.689
Deferentially, Your Honor,
and with all due respect--

29:17.827 --> 29:19.000
And not so deferentially,

29:19.137 --> 29:21.448
it's either a disposition
or a trial.

29:21.965 --> 29:23.241
Oh my God!

29:23.379 --> 29:25.034
Does anyone care about
the law around here?

29:28.827 --> 29:31.413
Miss Hastings, you're right.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.344
Sometimes, it'’s easy for us
to forget what our job is

29:34.482 --> 29:36.482
and I want to let you know
I do care about the law.

29:36.620 --> 29:37.655
That'’s wonderful, Your Honor.

29:37.793 --> 29:39.068
Now, if you don'’t step back,

29:39.206 --> 29:40.862
you'’ll be spending
the night in jail.

29:48.689 --> 29:52.758
And that is why we don'’t bother
with motions with AP5.

29:55.103 --> 29:56.586
Alright.

30:02.137 --> 30:03.448
Hey!

30:04.034 --> 30:05.310
Are you getting lunch, too?

30:05.689 --> 30:07.793
- What do you say I join you?
- Huh?

30:08.310 --> 30:10.413
Just could use some
a sounding board,

30:10.551 --> 30:12.103
catching has been rough.

30:12.241 --> 30:14.034
I mean, I know we don'’t
always get along but It's OK.

30:14.172 --> 30:15.931
I'’m just looking
for a good seat.

30:27.655 --> 30:29.758
So our case looks like
a losing battle,

30:29.896 --> 30:32.448
which is unfortunate
since our client is innocent.

30:32.724 --> 30:34.965
You know he turned
down a two-year plea bargain?

30:35.103 --> 30:37.758
Yeah and he had an alibi,
but the Judge excluded it.

30:37.896 --> 30:39.517
And then there was
the convicted criminal

30:39.655 --> 30:41.931
who went to see the victim
the day before she was killed.

30:42.068 --> 30:44.379
He lied about where he was
at the time of the murder.

30:44.517 --> 30:46.034
Oh my God!

30:46.758 --> 30:49.413
I know, I just...
I know this guy did it.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.793
This sounds
really difficult for you.

30:58.793 --> 31:00.344
OK, I'll see you later.

31:06.413 --> 31:08.034
This case comes down
to whether or not

31:08.172 --> 31:10.137
you believe an innocent person

31:10.275 --> 31:13.241
would confess to killing
his own mother.

31:14.275 --> 31:17.172
But you experienced
that interrogation.

31:18.068 --> 31:20.137
Remember how exhausted
you were?

31:20.862 --> 31:24.689
Hour after hour
continuously being worn down.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.344
One of you even
pulled the ripcord.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.275
Now imagine yourself
in that interrogation room,

31:31.586 --> 31:36.827
with those detectives
in your face for 19 hours.

31:37.758 --> 31:43.620
Making you feel that they will
not let up until you confess.

31:44.896 --> 31:46.551
Wouldn't you pull
the ripcord, too

31:47.172 --> 31:49.448
and try and fix it all later?

31:52.275 --> 31:54.931
All the physical evidences
explained away

31:55.172 --> 31:57.965
by Mr. Jablonsky
finding the body.

31:58.448 --> 32:00.965
There is no evidence
proving motive.

32:01.379 --> 32:02.827
There's only the confession.

32:03.586 --> 32:05.413
If you don'’t trust it,

32:06.172 --> 32:08.241
if you have doubts about it,

32:08.931 --> 32:12.000
you must find
Mr. Jablonsky not guilty.

32:21.103 --> 32:23.000
Fingerprints on the knife,

32:24.413 --> 32:26.551
sneaker prints in blood.

32:28.206 --> 32:31.896
A meth head who has stolen
from his mother before.

32:33.137 --> 32:34.517
No alibi,

32:35.206 --> 32:37.206
and the confession.

32:38.448 --> 32:41.241
Now, was the interrogation long?
Yes.

32:42.034 --> 32:43.344
Did they lie?

32:43.586 --> 32:45.034
They're are allowed to.

32:45.379 --> 32:46.862
But he confessed...

32:48.206 --> 32:49.827
To killing his mother.

32:51.482 --> 32:52.827
I don'’t care how long
you badger me,

32:52.965 --> 32:54.517
I'’m not confessing to that.

32:55.655 --> 32:57.931
When I watched
that tape, I was tired.

32:58.275 --> 33:00.448
If it were me,
I'd probably be worried

33:00.586 --> 33:03.241
but the one thing
I wouldn'’t do....

33:04.275 --> 33:05.655
Is confess.

33:07.172 --> 33:09.103
And you have to ask yourselves

33:10.275 --> 33:12.034
whether you would, either.

33:35.655 --> 33:36.965
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Jury,

33:37.103 --> 33:38.827
I understand
you have a verdict.

33:52.689 --> 33:54.758
Supreme Court New York County.

33:55.482 --> 33:58.206
The case of
The People vs. Kyle Jablonsky

33:58.517 --> 34:01.000
on the charge of murder
in the second degree.

34:01.241 --> 34:03.379
We, the Jury,
find the defendant...

34:03.862 --> 34:05.034
not guilty.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.758
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:10.413 --> 34:12.000
Oh, thank you so much!

34:20.310 --> 34:22.310
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

34:22.448 --> 34:23.620
But I do have one comment

34:23.758 --> 34:25.241
on your courtroom
performance, though.

34:25.379 --> 34:26.793
Oh, really? And how many years
of trial experience

34:26.931 --> 34:28.862
do you have? Oh wait,
I'm sorry, none.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.172
Ah! But my comment is this:

34:31.310 --> 34:33.655
You were amazing!

34:34.034 --> 34:35.241
Thank you.

34:35.482 --> 34:36.793
Have dinner with me tonight.

34:36.965 --> 34:38.344
There is something
I want to ask you.

34:38.482 --> 34:42.172
- 8 PM, at Margot.
- OK, yeah.

34:47.275 --> 34:49.172
I felt this way
since we first met.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.586
I can'’t stop
thinking about you.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.344
You're the only man
who gives me butterflies

34:54.482 --> 34:56.068
and I want to be with you.

34:57.344 --> 34:59.896
I just hope
you feel the same way.

35:01.206 --> 35:02.931
OK, that'’s pretty good.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.931
I don'’t know, maybe just like,
a little bit sexier.

35:05.068 --> 35:08.034
You know, like,
you start like this.

35:09.655 --> 35:12.000
Oh, please stop,
I am not doing that, Tracy!

35:12.137 --> 35:14.448
Your boy is there,
now the party can start!

35:17.413 --> 35:20.275
- Give me a hit.
- Sure, help yourself, Tom.

35:20.793 --> 35:21.931
What'’s going on?

35:22.068 --> 35:23.379
It's that after-work flow,
you know,

35:23.517 --> 35:25.275
work hard, play harder, repeat.

35:25.896 --> 35:28.137
It doesn'’t matter
if you smoke pot, get drunk,

35:28.275 --> 35:30.413
do yoga, meditate,
you gotta do something

35:30.551 --> 35:32.379
to take the edge off
or you'll be Kitson,

35:32.517 --> 35:34.275
quitting suddenly
and joining an ashram.

35:34.448 --> 35:36.793
I heard he moved to Vermont
to do some wood working.

35:36.931 --> 35:39.137
No, Colorado, ski instructor.

35:39.517 --> 35:41.482
Anyway, he was a good lawyer,
you know.

35:41.689 --> 35:43.482
I'’m not really a smoker, so...

35:43.620 --> 35:45.068
Pass the jay.

35:49.655 --> 35:52.448
Oh, come on, little rookie, you
can'’t be that shocked by pot.

35:52.689 --> 35:56.137
OK, I covered a menacing
harassment case today.

35:56.344 --> 35:57.551
I did a motion.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.034
- I'’m sorry, you did a motion?
- Uh-ha!

35:59.172 --> 36:02.068
- In AP5?
- Can I tweak that, please?

36:02.206 --> 36:05.862
Oh my God! OK, OK, look,
sweetie, here, just one hit.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.793
Lord, what are you doing?

36:38.413 --> 36:42.655
Why, your Honor, I do declare
you are working too hard.

36:45.862 --> 36:47.551
How'd you do in court today?

36:47.827 --> 36:49.689
- Very well.
- Mhmm.

36:49.931 --> 36:51.241
Thanks for asking.

36:51.689 --> 36:53.827
No, don't kiss me.

36:55.862 --> 36:57.172
OK.

36:57.931 --> 36:59.482
We don'’t have to kiss.

37:00.241 --> 37:02.103
You sure made a miracle happen.

37:03.448 --> 37:05.344
I can make a lot
of miracles happen.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.275
Shall I show you?

37:22.103 --> 37:24.379
Since when are you rough?

37:38.241 --> 37:39.206
Hey girl.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.758
Careful, Judge.

37:40.896 --> 37:43.620
One hole or the other.
You think you can keep up?

37:43.827 --> 37:45.793
I can do more than keep up.

37:49.931 --> 37:51.758
Judge Dodson!

37:54.034 --> 37:56.344
Oh, your Honor, God!

37:56.482 --> 37:57.689
What'’s up?

37:57.827 --> 37:59.965
No, I was just...
She called me, and I...

38:00.103 --> 38:01.137
OK.

38:01.275 --> 38:03.482
- You look nice.
- You look great.

38:07.379 --> 38:09.275
So, then he turns to me
and he says,

38:09.482 --> 38:11.965
"“I'll take plea
if you feed my cat."”

38:12.103 --> 38:13.586
I was like, "“what?"”

38:13.724 --> 38:15.586
And the question is,
what did you do?

38:15.724 --> 38:17.275
I fed his cat.

38:17.413 --> 38:19.758
I chased that mean ass cat
around in my four inch heels.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.275
What'’s this?

38:28.448 --> 38:29.482
For letting me get
my hands dirty

38:29.620 --> 38:31.000
and help with your case.

38:32.413 --> 38:35.310
Whoa, wait, whoa,
this says first edition.

38:36.103 --> 38:38.344
You know Zora Neale Hurston
is my spirit animal, right?

38:38.482 --> 38:39.689
Your super soul melanin Queen

38:39.827 --> 38:41.620
is what I remember
you calling her.

38:42.793 --> 38:44.068
Their eyes were watching God.

38:44.206 --> 38:45.586
Made you into
who you are today.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.965
Exactly.

38:47.103 --> 38:48.241
Janie chose her own path

38:48.379 --> 38:49.862
regardless of what
people thought.

38:50.551 --> 38:52.275
She wasn't supposed to have
big dreams as a black woman

38:52.413 --> 38:54.862
but she did
and she didn't give a damn.

38:55.758 --> 38:57.172
Like you don'’t.

38:58.517 --> 39:00.206
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:00.344 --> 39:02.724
So, you said you had something
to tell me tonight?

39:04.206 --> 39:05.448
Well...

39:06.275 --> 39:08.517
I want to base
my lead character on you.

39:09.793 --> 39:11.793
- You OK with that?
- Ah...

39:11.931 --> 39:14.103
Well, it depends, what would
this character will be like?

39:14.655 --> 39:19.551
Well, she'’d be fearless,
clever, rebellious.

39:19.793 --> 39:22.620
Fueled by some inner outrage,
like Janie.

39:23.275 --> 39:24.689
There ain't nothing
more important to her

39:24.827 --> 39:26.758
than doing right by her clients.

39:26.896 --> 39:29.931
She'’ll find the most
clever, unexpected angle

39:30.068 --> 39:31.551
to sway the Jury.

39:31.689 --> 39:35.310
Like making them watch 19 hours
of interrogation video.

39:36.034 --> 39:37.758
She'll be
fearlessly independent,

39:37.896 --> 39:39.379
convinced that
she doesn't need anyone

39:39.517 --> 39:41.758
but the truth is,
she desperately wants

39:41.896 --> 39:44.413
to need someone.
Someone who knows her.

39:44.551 --> 39:47.862
Someone who knows that
underneath that iron exterior,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.620
there's this sensitive woman.

39:49.758 --> 39:52.896
A woman who finally wants to
let herself be vulnerable.

39:58.206 --> 40:00.862
I mean, why does
she have to be vulnerable?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.758
Listen, I have something
I want to tell you, too.

40:09.965 --> 40:12.689
- Hi, baby.
- Hey!

40:13.655 --> 40:14.896
My event finished early

40:15.034 --> 40:17.137
and I remember
you said you'’d be here.

40:17.931 --> 40:19.586
You must be Gwen.

40:19.724 --> 40:22.241
Finally, I get to put
the face to the name.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.310
Alison, this is Gwen.

40:25.448 --> 40:28.241
Gwen, this is
Alison, my fiancée.

40:35.896 --> 40:37.551
Next time on In Contempt...

40:37.689 --> 40:39.517
They think you
tampered with the Jury.

40:39.655 --> 40:41.827
Until that gets resolved,
you're kryptonite.

40:42.586 --> 40:43.758
Clearly, I misread
the situation.

40:43.896 --> 40:45.034
He is not into me at all.

40:45.172 --> 40:46.655
Here's a thought,
go for him anyway.

40:46.793 --> 40:48.379
It'’s wrong
on so many levels, Trace.

40:48.517 --> 40:51.517
Oh, wait. You are not trying
The Stash and Cash, are you?

40:51.655 --> 40:52.827
That'’s what my client wants.

40:52.965 --> 40:54.517
No, that'’s not
a winnable case.

40:54.655 --> 40:56.793
It's all about your client,
he may look like a creep--

40:56.931 --> 40:59.000
He is a creep.
He's a subway robber.

40:59.137 --> 41:00.689
They're going to this
restaurant tonight.

41:00.827 --> 41:02.482
I was thinking about
showing up, is that stalkery?

41:02.620 --> 41:05.448
Hey, Bennet, my word!
