ONE OF WHICH IS THE ARMADILLO.

01:12.533 --> 01:13.266
WHICH IS THE PERFECT ANIMAL.

01:13.333 --> 01:13.933
FOR STARTERS, IT LOOKS LIKE A

01:14.000 --> 01:14.500
POSSUM WHO WORKS AT MEDIEVAL

01:14.566 --> 01:15.766
TIMES.

01:15.833 --> 01:17.300

SADLY, THOUGH, TONIGHT CAN'T BE

01:39.066 --> 01:39.900
ALL FUN ARMADILLO FACTS, BECAUSE

01:39.966 --> 01:41.166
TEXAS IS CURRENTLY REELING FROM

01:41.233 --> 01:42.000
AN INCREDIBLY DRACONIAN NEW

01:42.066 --> 01:44.433
ABORTION LAW.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.966
>> ABORTION PROVIDERS IN TEXAS

01:55.300 --> 01:57.333
"FETAL HEARTBEAT" IS DETECTED.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.900

01:58.966 --> 02:01.300
HOW UNDEVELOPED THE EMBRYO IS AT

02:01.366 --> 02:01.900
THAT STAGE.

02:01.966 --> 02:03.033
THE LAW MAKES NO EXCEPTION FOR

02:03.100 --> 02:04.833

02:06.033 --> 02:06.933
ALLOW STATE OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE

02:07.000 --> 02:09.433
THE BAN.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.833

02:27.200 --> 02:28.066

WAS SUCH A HUGE PIECE OF NEWS,

02:48.666 --> 02:51.033
EVEN TMZ HAD TO WEIGH IN.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.133
>> THE SUPREME COURT COULD HAVE

02:52.200 --> 02:53.933
BLOCKED THIS.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.533
BECAUSE IF ANY LAW SEEMS COUNTER

02:56.600 --> 02:57.166
TO ROE VS WADE, IT WOULD SEEM TO

02:57.233 --> 02:58.666
BE THIS.

02:58.733 --> 02:59.800
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE

02:59.866 --> 03:02.033

TEXAS HAPPEN AT THE SIX WEEK OR

03:10.366 --> 03:12.066
LATER MARK.

03:12.133 --> 03:13.300
>> MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW

03:13.366 --> 03:14.400
THEY'RE PREGNANT WITHIN THE SIX

03:14.466 --> 03:15.400
WEEK PERIOD.

03:15.466 --> 03:16.433
>> RIGHT, AND THE WAY THAT, YOU

03:16.500 --> 03:18.100
KNOW, ROE WORKED WAS, IT WAS

03:18.166 --> 03:18.666
ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE

03:18.733 --> 03:18.933
FETUS.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.933
IT WAS 20 to 24 WEEKS.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.200
THAT'S A MASSIVE PERIOD OF TIME

03:23.266 --> 03:24.200
IN WHICH WOMEN WERE HAVING LEGAL

03:24.266 --> 03:25.333
ABORTIONS.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
NOW IN TEXAS, IF YOU GET SUED

03:26.466 --> 03:28.100
UNDER THIS LAW, AND YOU LOSE,

03:28.166 --> 03:30.333
THEY CAN SHUT DOWN YOUR CLINIC.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.266
>> THEY SHUT DOWN THE CLINIC.

03:31.333 --> 03:37.066
>> THEY SHUT THE CLINIC DOWN.

03:37.133 --> 03:37.566
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK?

03:37.633 --> 03:38.366
CONGRATULATIONS, TEXAS, YOU JUST

03:38.433 --> 03:41.733
BROKE TMZ.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.366
THEY SHOULDN'T BE COVERING THIS

03:42.433 --> 03:42.666
STORY.

03:42.733 --> 03:43.366
THEY SHOULD BE DOING WHAT THEY

03:43.433 --> 03:44.866
DO BEST, GATHERING ROUND IN A

03:44.933 --> 03:45.533
CIRCLE OF AMERICA'S WORST

03:58.933 --> 03:59.600
YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT.

03:59.666 --> 04:00.233
THAT GUY IN SHORTS SHOULDN'T BE

04:00.300 --> 04:00.800

04:00.866 --> 04:02.866

04:02.933 --> 04:03.833
THOUGH I GUESS IF HE'S DOING MY

04:03.900 --> 04:05.100
JOB, I GET TO DO HIS, AND SPEND

04:05.166 --> 04:06.100

04:16.066 --> 04:17.433
IT'S WALLACE SHAWN.

04:17.500 --> 04:17.966
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:18.033 --> 04:21.766
THIS IS BETTER.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.166
IT'S A BETTER SHOW.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.033
THIS LAW WILL HAVE CATASTROPHIC

04:24.100 --> 04:25.466
EFFECTS.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.166
PROVIDERS SAY IT WOULD HAVE

04:26.233 --> 04:28.366
PREVENTED AT LEAST 85% OF THE

04:28.433 --> 04:29.100
PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED

04:29.166 --> 04:30.866
IN THE STATE.

04:30.933 --> 04:32.100
AND WHEN GOVERNOR ABBOTT WAS

04:32.166 --> 04:33.833
PRESSED ON WHY HE SIGNED A BILL

04:33.900 --> 04:36.400
THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY FORCE

04:36.466 --> 04:37.000
SOMEONE WHO'D EXPERIENCED RAPE

04:37.066 --> 04:38.166
OR INCEST TO CARRY A PREGNANCY

04:38.233 --> 04:38.800
TO TERM, HIS RESPONSE...

04:38.866 --> 04:40.400
WAS SOMETHING.

04:40.466 --> 04:40.966
>> LET'S MAKE SOMETHING VERY

04:41.033 --> 04:42.600
CLEAR.

04:42.666 --> 04:46.100
RAPE IS A CRIME.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.966
AND TEXAS WILL WORK TIRELESSLY

04:48.033 --> 04:50.766
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ELIMINATE

04:50.833 --> 04:51.733
ALL RAPISTS FROM THE STREETS OF

04:51.800 --> 04:53.233
TEXAS BY AGGRESSIVELY GOING OUT

04:53.300 --> 04:54.866
AND ARRESTING THEM AND

04:54.933 --> 04:56.800
PROSECUTING THEM AND GETTING

04:56.866 --> 04:58.400
THEM OFF THE STREETS.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.066

05:03.833 --> 05:05.600
"WE'LL ARREST RAPISTS," LIKE

05:05.666 --> 05:06.800
IT'S A BRAND-NEW IDEA AND YOU'RE

05:06.866 --> 05:09.933
TIM COOK UNVEILING A NEW IPHONE,

05:10.000 --> 05:11.833
WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW ABBOTT

05:11.900 --> 05:12.766
CLEARLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

05:12.833 --> 05:13.633
IT'S NOT JUST SCARY, FACELESS

05:13.700 --> 05:15.366
CRIMINALS ON THE STREETS

05:15.433 --> 05:16.233
PERPETRATING RAPES, BUT MOST

05:16.300 --> 05:16.800
OFTEN, IT'S ACTUALLY SOMEONE

05:16.866 --> 05:20.866
KNOWN TO THE VICTIM.

05:20.933 --> 05:21.500
WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW

05:21.566 --> 05:22.033
ARRESTING RAPISTS DOESN'T

05:22.100 --> 05:22.600
ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM OF

05:22.666 --> 05:23.133
WOMEN NEEDING LEGAL, SAFE

05:23.200 --> 05:26.833
ABORTIONS.

05:26.900 --> 05:27.466
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE MYRIAD

05:27.533 --> 05:28.333
OF REASONS WOMEN GET ABORTIONS,

05:28.400 --> 05:29.000
AND HOW FRAMING THE ISSUE AROUND

05:29.066 --> 05:29.900
THE MOST HORRIFIC SITUATIONS

05:29.966 --> 05:31.700
FURTHER DEMONIZES THE PROCEDURE.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.266
BUT HONESTLY, IT MIGHT JUST BE

05:34.333 --> 05:35.233
QUICKER JUST TO SAY FUCK OFF,

05:35.300 --> 05:36.933
GREG, AS SHORTHAND FOR THE OTHER

05:37.000 --> 05:38.300
STUFF WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET

05:38.366 --> 05:40.366
INTO.

05:40.433 --> 05:41.600
NOW, THANKFULLY, PEOPLE ARE

05:41.666 --> 05:43.133
PUSHING BACK HARD.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.566
ON THURSDAY, THE DOJ ANNOUNCED

05:44.633 --> 05:46.133
IT WAS SUING TEXAS, CALLING THE

05:46.200 --> 05:47.866
LAW AN "UNPRECEDENTED SCHEME TO

05:47.933 --> 05:48.500
EVADE JUDICIAL REVIEW," WHICH IT

05:48.566 --> 05:51.133
IS.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.700
AND WHEN A PRO-LIFE GROUP SET UP

05:52.766 --> 05:54.200
A WEBSITE WHERE PEOPLE COULD

05:54.266 --> 05:55.100
REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE NEW

05:55.166 --> 05:56.333
LAW, PEOPLE STARTED QUICKLY

05:56.400 --> 05:57.866
FLOODING IT WITH TIPS LIKE

05:57.933 --> 05:59.500
CLAIMING THE FICTIONAL

05:59.566 --> 06:00.666
CHARACTERS IN MARVEL'S AVENGERS

06:00.733 --> 06:02.466
WERE APPARENTLY SEEKING

06:02.533 --> 06:04.033
ABORTIONS, WHICH AT THE VERY

06:04.100 --> 06:05.933
LEAST IS A HELL OF A PITCH FOR

06:06.000 --> 06:07.566
AN EPISODE OF "WHAT IF?"

06:07.633 --> 06:09.400
AND SOME WENT WITH AN EVEN

06:09.466 --> 06:11.533
BLUNTER APPROACH.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.566
>> I FOUND THIS WEBSITE FOR

06:12.633 --> 06:14.633
LIKE, ANONYMOUSLY SNITCHING ON

06:14.700 --> 06:15.600
PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE TEXAS

06:15.666 --> 06:17.266
HEARTBEAT ACT.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.366
YOU CAN ATTACH ANY FILE YOU WANT

06:19.433 --> 06:22.666
TO IT, SO I JUST SENT THEM A

06:22.733 --> 06:27.966
BUNCH OF SHREK PORN.

06:28.033 --> 06:28.466
>> John: YEAH.

06:28.533 --> 06:29.600
"TIKTOK USERS BOMBARD

06:29.666 --> 06:31.766
ANTI-ABORTION WEBSITE WITH SHREK

06:31.833 --> 06:33.033
PORN" IS ONE OF THOSE SENTENCES

06:33.100 --> 06:34.333
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY

06:34.400 --> 06:35.366
LIKE, "EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP

06:35.433 --> 06:36.966
TALKING ABOUT KIM JONG UN'S SEXY

06:39.066 --> 06:42.833
HAPPY RIGHT NOW!"

06:42.900 --> 06:44.400
LOOK, FUCKING WITH PRO-LIFERS ON

06:44.466 --> 06:45.800
TIKTOK IS CLEARLY FUNNY, BUT

06:45.866 --> 06:46.533
IT'S NOT GOING TO ROLL BACK THIS

06:46.600 --> 06:48.333
LAW.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.866
AND TEXAS SEEMS TO BE FACING FEW

06:49.933 --> 06:51.666
CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT IT'S DONE.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.000
WHEN GREG ABBOTT WAS ASKED

06:53.066 --> 06:54.633
WHETHER HE WORRIED THE LAW WOULD

06:54.700 --> 06:55.533
DETER INVESTMENT IN THE STATE,

06:55.600 --> 06:57.100
HE SAID, "YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

06:57.166 --> 06:58.433
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES

06:58.500 --> 06:59.766
AND A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO LIKE

06:59.833 --> 07:01.000
THE SOCIAL POSITIONS THAT THE

07:01.066 --> 07:02.466
STATE OF TEXAS IS TAKING."

07:02.533 --> 07:06.466
AND THE THING IS, SO FAR, MUCH

07:06.533 --> 07:07.933
OF CORPORATE AMERICA HAS DECIDED

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
TO NOT WEIGH IN ON THIS,

07:09.066 --> 07:10.266
A STARK CONTRAST WITH THEIR

07:10.333 --> 07:12.700
RECENT WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK OUT

07:12.766 --> 07:13.200
ON VOTING RIGHTS, RACIAL

07:13.266 --> 07:13.833
JUSTICE, AND OTHER SOCIAL

07:13.900 --> 07:15.000
ISSUES.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.700
AND IT'S NOT JUST SILENCE HERE.

07:17.766 --> 07:19.166
A MAJOR DONOR TO THE SPONSORS

07:19.233 --> 07:20.733
AND COSPONSORS OF THIS BILL IS A

07:20.800 --> 07:22.900
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE

07:22.966 --> 07:24.200
BELONGING TO AT&T, WHO --

07:24.266 --> 07:25.600
PENDING APPROVAL OF OUR SALE TO

07:25.666 --> 07:26.566
DISCOVERY -- ARE STILL

07:26.633 --> 07:29.166
TECHNICALLY OUR BUSINESS DADDY.

07:29.233 --> 07:30.800
SO WE ASKED THEM TO COMMENT ON

07:30.866 --> 07:32.566
THIS, AND THEY TOLD US, "AT&T

07:32.633 --> 07:34.433
HAS NEVER TAKEN A STANCE ON

07:34.500 --> 07:36.600
ABORTION," AN AMAZING SENTENCE,

07:36.666 --> 07:39.100
AND "EMPLOYEE PAC CONTRIBUTIONS

07:39.166 --> 07:40.266
TO TEXAS LEGISLATORS WENT TO

07:40.333 --> 07:41.833
BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF

07:41.900 --> 07:43.100
THE TEXAS LEGISLATION."

07:43.166 --> 07:46.366
AND LISTEN, NOT TAKING A STANCE

07:46.433 --> 07:47.633
ON THIS ISSUE, RIGHT NOW, IS

07:47.700 --> 07:49.800
TAKING A STANCE.

07:49.866 --> 07:52.633
AND BOTH-SIDES'ING ABORTION

07:52.700 --> 07:53.933
ISN'T REALLY THE PR SLAM DUNK

07:54.000 --> 07:56.433
THEY THINK IT IS.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.000
ALTHOUGH IT'S CERTAINLY ON

07:57.066 --> 07:58.366
BRAND.

07:58.433 --> 07:59.800
AT&T CLEARLY LIKES THEIR PUBLIC

07:59.866 --> 08:02.600
STATEMENTS THE SAME WAY THEY

08:02.666 --> 08:05.200
LIKE THEIR CELL SIGNAL:

08:05.266 --> 08:06.433
HILARIOUSLY FUCKING WEAK.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.633
AND LOOK, THE FIGHT TO UNDERMINE

08:07.700 --> 08:08.300
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN

08:08.366 --> 08:09.166
ABORTION IS NOT JUST HAPPENING

08:09.233 --> 08:10.566
IN TEXAS.

08:10.633 --> 08:11.733
THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR

08:11.800 --> 08:12.633
ARGUMENTS ABOUT A MISSISSIPPI

08:12.700 --> 08:13.933
ANTI-ABORTION LAW LATER THIS

08:14.000 --> 08:15.200
YEAR THAT'S A DIRECT CHALLENGE

08:15.266 --> 08:18.166
TO ROE V WADE.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.133
THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL

08:19.200 --> 08:20.700
DEBATE, BUT THE LATEST

08:20.766 --> 08:21.866
ESCALATION IN THE ONGOING ATTACK

08:21.933 --> 08:23.266
ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.400
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

08:25.466 --> 08:26.833
WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW INFURIATING

08:26.900 --> 08:29.200
THAT IS, BUT MAYBE THIS SUMS

08:29.266 --> 08:35.366
THINGS UP BEST.

08:35.433 --> 08:38.900
[SCREAMING]

08:38.966 --> 08:41.600
WELL SAID, BUDDY.

08:41.666 --> 08:45.166
AND NOW THIS.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.800
>> AND NOW, YET AGAIN, IT'S THIS

08:47.866 --> 08:48.133
TIME OF YEAR.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.433
>> A FAN FAVORITE AT STARBUCKS

08:51.500 --> 08:52.700
IS BACK WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR

08:52.766 --> 08:53.200
NOT.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.533
BRINGING BACK ITS PUMPKIN SPICE

09:07.133 --> 09:09.266
FLAVOR FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOR

09:09.333 --> 09:09.533
WEEKS?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.766
AND MY RESPONSE TO HIM IS I

09:11.833 --> 09:13.266
DON'T CARE.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.666
>> SHUT UP, ERIC.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.766
NOBODY CARES!

09:17.833 --> 09:20.833
ERIC, YOU FUCKING NERD!

09:20.900 --> 09:22.700
>> I LIKE IT.

09:22.766 --> 09:23.033
I DON'T CARE.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.200
>> I WOULD HAVE THEM TOGETHER

09:24.266 --> 09:26.066
BUT DON'T STICK THEM IN EACH

09:26.133 --> 09:28.600
OTHER.

09:28.666 --> 09:31.266
>> GET THE COFFEE AND THE

09:31.333 --> 09:33.066
PUMPKIN, JAM THE PUMPKIN IN THE

09:33.133 --> 09:38.100
MILL, SHOVE IT ALL UNTIL SO I

09:38.166 --> 09:38.900
MIGHT LIVE RELIGIOUSLY.

09:38.966 --> 09:40.833
>> NOW BUD LIGHT IS ROLLING OUT

09:40.900 --> 09:42.933

>> WAIT, WHAT?

09:45.800 --> 09:49.200
ACTUALLY, CAN WE CUT FOR A

09:49.266 --> 09:49.433
SECOND?

09:49.500 --> 09:50.100
BUD LIGHT?

09:50.166 --> 09:53.833
BUD LIGHT SELTZER?

09:53.900 --> 09:57.166
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

09:57.233 --> 10:00.866
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:00.933 --> 10:06.733
THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.500
YOU RUINED IT.

10:09.566 --> 10:12.400
IT WAS PERFECT AND YOU RUINED I

10:12.466 --> 10:16.533
IT.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

10:18.800 --> 10:19.133
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:19.200 --> 10:19.766
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:19.833 --> 10:20.000
BELARUS.

10:20.066 --> 10:20.500
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE

10:20.566 --> 10:21.100
EXPECTING ME TO PLAY THAT GAME

10:21.166 --> 10:21.666
WHERE I TELL YOU THAT'S NOT

10:21.733 --> 10:22.300
ACTUALLY BELARUS, IT'S SOMEWHERE

10:22.366 --> 10:27.800
ELSE.

10:27.866 --> 10:28.433
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THAT GAME

10:28.500 --> 10:29.100
WAS SUPPOSED TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO

10:29.166 --> 10:29.666
LEARN SOME BASIC GEOGRAPHY.

10:29.733 --> 10:30.300
AND I STARTED TO GET THE SENSE

10:30.366 --> 10:30.900
THAT SOME OF YOU JUST GREW TO

10:30.966 --> 10:32.500
ENJOY BEING HUMILIATED BY IT.

10:32.566 --> 10:33.566
WHICH IS WHY THOSE PARTICULAR

10:33.633 --> 10:34.200
PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

10:34.266 --> 10:34.700
THAT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY

10:34.766 --> 10:35.900
BELARUS.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.266
THAT'S BELARUS.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.700
HAPPY NOW, YOU FREAKS?

10:40.766 --> 10:44.466
SPECIFICALLY, WE'D LIKE TO TALK

10:44.533 --> 10:45.033
ABOUT BELARUS' PRESIDENT AND

10:45.100 --> 10:45.600
AUTOCRATIC LEADER, ALEXANDER

10:45.666 --> 10:46.233
LUKASHENKO, WHO HAS HAD QUITE A

10:46.300 --> 10:48.433
YEAR.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED

10:49.566 --> 10:51.133
STORIES ABOUT BELARUS POPPING UP

10:51.200 --> 10:53.066
WITH INCREASING REGULARITY.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.133
ESPECIALLY SINCE LAST AUGUST,

10:54.200 --> 10:54.800
WHEN THEY HAD A HIGHLY CONTESTED

10:54.866 --> 10:55.500
ELECTION WHICH MADE

10:55.566 --> 10:57.800
INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES.

10:57.866 --> 10:58.833
>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

10:58.900 --> 11:00.033
UNLEASHING THEIR FURY IN THE

11:00.100 --> 11:01.866
CAPITAL CITY OF MINSK AND

11:01.933 --> 11:03.366
ELSEWHERE ALSO AROUND THE

11:03.433 --> 11:05.033
COUNTRY.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.566
MR. LUKASHENKO, WHO HAS RULED

11:06.633 --> 11:07.800
FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES, HAS

11:07.866 --> 11:10.366
FACED A WAVE OF ANGER OVER HIS

11:10.433 --> 11:11.333
HANDLING OF THE CORONAVIRUS

11:11.400 --> 11:17.200
PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMY.

11:17.266 --> 11:17.933
DESPITE THAT, OFFICIAL

11:18.000 --> 11:18.666
STATE-APPROVED EXIT POLLS GAVE

11:18.733 --> 11:19.300
HIM AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

11:19.366 --> 11:21.300
80%.

11:21.366 --> 11:22.333
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

11:22.400 --> 11:22.966
THEY CLAIMED LUKASHENKO WON WITH

11:23.033 --> 11:24.700
80% OF THE VOTE.

11:24.766 --> 11:25.366
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FISHY FOR

11:25.433 --> 11:26.633
A COUPLE OF REASONS.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.000
ONE, THE MASSIVE PROTESTS THAT

11:28.066 --> 11:28.700
FOLLOWED.

11:28.766 --> 11:30.633
AND TWO, THE IDEA THAT ANY MAN

11:30.700 --> 11:31.433
COULD STILL BE POPULAR AFTER

11:31.500 --> 11:32.566
NEARLY THREE DECADES IN THE

11:32.633 --> 11:34.633
PUBLIC EYE.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.233
I'VE ONLY HAD THIS SHOW FOR

11:35.300 --> 11:37.233
EIGHT YEARS, AND EVEN I CAN

11:37.300 --> 11:40.133
BARELY STAND THE SIGHT OF ME.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.466
AND BELARUSIANS AREN'T JUST

11:41.533 --> 11:42.633
FURIOUS AT LUKASHENKO FOR HIS

11:42.700 --> 11:44.166
HANDLING OF THE CORONAVIRUS --

11:44.233 --> 11:46.300
ALTHOUGH, FROM THE BEGINNING,

11:46.366 --> 11:47.133
HIS MANAGEMENT OF IT WAS

11:47.200 --> 11:49.833
INCREDIBLY RECKLESS.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.433
>> AT FIRST, HE CALLED THE VIRUS

11:51.500 --> 11:52.866
A PSYCHOSIS, AND SAID IT WAS

11:52.933 --> 11:55.133
TREATABLE WITH VODKA AND SAUNAS.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.033
AND AT A CROWDED HOCKEY GAME, HE

11:57.100 --> 12:00.266
DENIED ITS EXISTENCE.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.066
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:01.133 --> 12:02.533
THERE ARE NO VIRUSES HERE.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.066
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THEM FLYING

12:05.133 --> 12:05.300
AROUND?

12:05.366 --> 12:05.900
>> John: "YEAH, THAT MAKES

12:05.966 --> 12:07.600
SENSE!

12:07.666 --> 12:09.100
JUST LOOK AROUND -- YOU DON'T

12:09.166 --> 12:10.666
SEE ANY COVID VIRUSES, DO YOU?

12:10.733 --> 12:12.100
DO YOU HEAR ANY EBOLA?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.933
SMELL ANY MEASLES?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.100
TASTE ANY AIDS IN THE AIR?

12:15.166 --> 12:18.333
NO!

12:18.400 --> 12:18.800
OF COURSE NOT.

12:18.866 --> 12:19.466
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT

12:19.533 --> 12:19.766
HERE!

12:19.833 --> 12:20.933
WHAT IS HERE IS YOUR FEARLESS

12:21.000 --> 12:21.633
LEADER, WHO'S ABOUT TO GO AND

12:21.700 --> 12:22.533
SCORE A HAT TRICK FOR THE MINSK

12:22.600 --> 12:29.466
MIDLIFE CRISES."

12:29.533 --> 12:30.000
BUT LUKASHENKO'S TERRIBLE

12:30.066 --> 12:30.600
HANDLING OF COVID IS JUST THE

12:30.666 --> 12:30.966
BEGINNING HERE.

12:31.033 --> 12:31.600
LUKASHENKO HAS DESCRIBED HIMSELF

12:31.666 --> 12:32.166
AS "THE LAST AND ONLY DICTATOR

12:32.233 --> 12:32.466
IN EUROPE."

12:32.533 --> 12:33.366
WHICH IS, IN ITSELF, AN AMAZING

12:33.433 --> 12:34.966
THING TO SAY.

12:35.033 --> 12:36.833
BRAGGING ABOUT BEING "THE LAST

12:36.900 --> 12:38.600
DICTATOR" IS LIKE BRAGGING ABOUT

12:38.666 --> 12:40.866
BEING THE LAST RADIO SHACK, OR

12:40.933 --> 12:42.000
THE LAST PERSON TO MAKE A MOVIE

12:42.066 --> 12:44.333
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.100
THAT'S NOT AN ENVIABLE TITLE.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.600
AND SADLY, FOR SOME BELARUSIANS,

12:48.666 --> 12:49.500
HE'S THE ONLY LEADER THEY'VE

12:49.566 --> 12:51.066
EVER KNOWN.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.200
>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?

12:52.266 --> 12:53.466
>> I AM 22.

12:53.533 --> 12:54.166
>> YOU'RE 22?

12:54.233 --> 12:55.500
>> YEAH.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.766
>> SO, YOUR WHOLE LIFE, LIVED

12:56.833 --> 12:57.733
UNDER ONE PRESIDENT.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.033
HOW DOES THAT FEEL FOR YOU?

12:59.100 --> 13:00.700
>> WELL, IT FEELS LIKE SHIT.

13:00.766 --> 13:04.600
>> John: YEAH, I BET IT DOES.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.866
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PERSON

13:05.933 --> 13:06.533
WHO'S BEEN IN CHARGE FOR THAT

13:06.600 --> 13:08.166
MAN'S ENTIRE LIFE IS A HARD

13:08.233 --> 13:10.033
BOILED EGG WITH A MUSTACHE WHO

13:10.100 --> 13:11.433
CALLS HIMSELF A DICTATOR AND

13:11.500 --> 13:12.966
THINKS COVID ONLY EXISTS IF HE

13:13.033 --> 13:14.100
CAN SEE IT ZOOMING AROUND IN A

13:14.166 --> 13:17.166
TINY LITTLE JET.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.600
THAT PROTEST WAS FROM LAST

13:18.666 --> 13:19.266
SEPTEMBER, AND THINGS HAVE ONLY

13:19.333 --> 13:20.866
ESCALATED SINCE THEN.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.233
YOU MAY REMEMBER A BELARUSIAN

13:22.300 --> 13:23.400
ATHLETE REFUSING TO RETURN HOME

13:23.466 --> 13:24.433
DURING THE TOKYO OLYMPICS.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.966
AND BACK IN MAY, THIS HAPPENED.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.266
>> THIS MORNING, BELARUS IS

13:29.333 --> 13:31.266
FACING GROWING INTERNATIONAL

13:31.333 --> 13:32.133
PROTESTS AND CONDEMNATION AFTER

13:32.200 --> 13:33.100
THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT,

13:33.166 --> 13:35.666
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO SENT A

13:35.733 --> 13:37.200
FIGHTER JET TO GROUND A

13:37.266 --> 13:39.533
COMMERCIAL PLANE FLYING BETWEEN,

13:39.600 --> 13:41.333
TWO EUROPEAN CAPITALS.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
AND WITH IT, 26-YEAR-OLD

13:42.466 --> 13:43.466
DISSIDENT JOURNALIST ROMAN

13:43.533 --> 13:44.700
PROTASEVICH AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

13:44.766 --> 13:45.966
>> ONE PASSENGER SAYS ROMAN

13:46.033 --> 13:47.200
PLEADED, "DON'T DO THIS.

13:47.266 --> 13:48.733
THEY'LL KILL ME."

13:48.800 --> 13:49.966
THE RYANAIR CREW REPLIED, "WE

13:50.033 --> 13:51.866
HAVE NO CHOICE."

13:51.933 --> 13:53.366
>> John: YEAH, A JOURNALIST WHO

13:53.433 --> 13:54.600
WAS CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT

13:54.666 --> 13:56.400
BRIEFLY PASSED THROUGH

13:56.466 --> 13:57.600
BELARUSIAN AIRSPACE ON A

13:57.666 --> 13:58.733
COMMERCIAL FLIGHT, SO LUKASHENKO

13:58.800 --> 14:00.266
PERSONALLY ORDERED A FIGHTER JET

14:00.333 --> 14:01.266
TO INTERCEPT IT AND FORCE IT TO

14:01.333 --> 14:04.266
LAND.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.400
NOW, BELARUSIAN AUTHORITIES

14:05.466 --> 14:06.666
ORIGINALLY CLAIMED THEY DID THAT

14:06.733 --> 14:07.666
BECAUSE OF AN EMAILED BOMB

14:07.733 --> 14:09.300
THREAT FROM HAMAS, BUT RECORDS

14:09.366 --> 14:11.766
SHOW THAT EMAIL WAS SENT 24

14:11.833 --> 14:13.000
MINUTES AFTER THEY INFORMED THE

14:13.066 --> 14:14.866
PILOT ABOUT THE BOMB THREAT.

14:14.933 --> 14:18.066
NOT TO MENTION IT WAS SENT FROM

14:18.133 --> 14:20.966
AhmedYurlanov1988@protonmail.com

14:21.033 --> 14:21.766
WITH THE SUBJECT LINE "ALLAHU

14:21.833 --> 14:22.633
AKBAR."

14:22.700 --> 14:26.533
WHICH IS JUST IMPOSSIBLY LAZY.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
IT'S ONE STEP ABOVE EMAILING

14:28.566 --> 14:31.800
FROM BadGuys6969@yahoo.com WITH

14:31.866 --> 14:33.633
THE SUBJECT LINE "TERRORIST

14:33.700 --> 14:36.633
STUFF PARENTHESES LIKE 9/11."

14:36.700 --> 14:38.200
SO GIVEN HOW MUCH THINGS SEEM TO

14:38.266 --> 14:39.166
BE SPIRALING IN BELARUS, WE

14:39.233 --> 14:40.433
THOUGHT TONIGHT, IT'D BE WORTH

14:40.500 --> 14:42.333
GIVING YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR

14:42.400 --> 14:43.000
WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE, AND

14:43.066 --> 14:44.500
TAKING A LOOK AT EXACTLY WHO

14:44.566 --> 14:46.600
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO IS.

14:46.666 --> 14:47.633
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

14:47.700 --> 14:49.366
THAT HE IS THE GREATEST

14:49.433 --> 14:50.133
PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF

14:50.200 --> 14:52.100
BELARUS, SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE

14:52.166 --> 14:53.233
IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN THE

14:53.300 --> 14:55.033
HISTORY OF BELARUS.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.266
LUKASHENKO WON THE COUNTRY'S

14:56.333 --> 14:57.600
FIRST FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN

14:57.666 --> 15:00.633
1994, THREE YEARS AFTER THE FALL

15:00.700 --> 15:02.033
OF THE SOVIET UNION, WHEN HE, A

15:02.100 --> 15:07.000
FORMER MANAGER OF A STATE-OWNED

15:07.066 --> 15:07.600
FARM, VOWED TO RAISE TAXES ON

15:07.666 --> 15:08.566
THE RICH AND DEFEAT CORRUPTION.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.166
HE WAS GENUINELY POPULAR AT THE

15:10.233 --> 15:11.966
TIME.

15:12.033 --> 15:14.400
JUST LISTEN TO A FORMER

15:14.466 --> 15:15.000
AIDE-TURNED-CRITIC RECALL HOW

15:15.066 --> 15:15.866
PEOPLE REACTED TO HIM AT HIS

15:15.933 --> 15:17.833
RALLIES.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.600
>> 3,000 PEOPLE WHO WERE

15:19.666 --> 15:20.533
LISTENING TO HIM INSTEAD OF

15:20.600 --> 15:21.166
LEAVING THE STADIUM MOVED

15:21.233 --> 15:23.033
TOWARDS HIM LIKE AN AVALANCHE.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.766
I REMEMBER AS IF IT HAPPENED

15:24.833 --> 15:26.366
YESTERDAY.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.366
THEY WERE REACHING OUT TO HIM

15:27.433 --> 15:28.800
LIKE BELIEVERS TO A RELIC

15:28.866 --> 15:34.500
PRAYING FOR GOD'S GRACE.

15:34.566 --> 15:35.800
WOMEN WERE LIFTING UP THEIR

15:35.866 --> 15:36.766
CHILDREN FOR LUKASHENKO TO TOUCH

15:36.833 --> 15:37.766
THEM.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.800
OTHERS WERE REACHING OUT WITH

15:39.866 --> 15:40.566
BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, OR EVEN

15:40.633 --> 15:41.233
BANKNOTES JUST TO GET HIS

15:41.300 --> 15:43.133
AUTOGRAPH.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.300
WELL, LUKASHENKO WAS NO MICHAEL

15:44.366 --> 15:45.633
JACKSON, BUT THIS IS WHAT REALLY

15:45.700 --> 15:46.533
HAPPENED.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.333
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.733
WAS HE NO MICHAEL JACKSON?

15:50.800 --> 15:51.566
THINK ABOUT IT.

15:51.633 --> 15:53.033
LUKASHENKO WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR

15:53.100 --> 15:54.600
IN THE '90s, DIEHARD FANS PACKED

15:54.666 --> 15:56.133
STADIUMS TO SEE HIM, AND HE

15:56.200 --> 15:56.833
EVENTUALLY TORPEDOED HIS

15:56.900 --> 15:57.666
REPUTATION BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT

15:57.733 --> 15:58.700
HE WAS AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER.

15:58.766 --> 16:00.100
TO BE HONEST, I THINK LUKASHENKO

16:00.166 --> 16:02.866
FULLY EARNED THAT COMPARISON.

16:02.933 --> 16:05.633
AND HE STILL VERY MUCH PLAYS UP

16:05.700 --> 16:06.666
HIS HUMBLE FARM BACKGROUND

16:06.733 --> 16:07.566
THROUGH PHOTO OPS, LIKE THIS

16:07.633 --> 16:09.100
ONE, WHERE HE'S HARVESTING

16:09.166 --> 16:10.366
POTATOES WHILE DRESSED LIKE CHEF

16:10.433 --> 16:12.700
BOYARDEE AT AN ORGY.

16:12.766 --> 16:14.100
HE ONCE GAVE FOUR BAGS OF

16:14.166 --> 16:15.500
POTATOES AND A TUB OF LARD TO

16:15.566 --> 16:17.500
VLADIMIR PUTIN AS A CHRISTMAS

16:17.566 --> 16:19.500
GIFT, AND WHEN STEVEN SEAGAL

16:19.566 --> 16:22.600
VISITED BELARUS, LUKASHENKO ALSO

16:22.666 --> 16:23.766
GIFTED HIM PRODUCE, WITH "THE

16:23.833 --> 16:24.333
WASHINGTON POST" POETICALLY

16:24.400 --> 16:26.000
WRITING AT THE TIME, "THERE WAS

16:26.066 --> 16:27.533
NO HESITATION ON STEVEN SEAGAL'S

16:27.600 --> 16:29.233
FACE AS HE TOOK A RAW, FRESHLY

16:29.300 --> 16:30.233
PEELED CARROT FROM THE HANDS OF

16:30.300 --> 16:31.766
THE BELARUSAN PRESIDENT

16:31.833 --> 16:33.400
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO AND BIT

16:33.466 --> 16:34.566
INTO IT WITH A SATISFYING

16:34.633 --> 16:36.266
CHOMP."

16:36.333 --> 16:38.633
WHICH IS JUST A TAPESTRY OF

16:38.700 --> 16:40.466
WORDS.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.000
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A VIDEO TO

16:42.066 --> 16:44.666
IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO

16:44.733 --> 16:46.100
STEVEN SEAGAL USING HIS MOUTH

16:46.166 --> 16:47.400
BONES TO BREAK OFF THE TIP OF

16:47.466 --> 16:48.800
THAT RABBIT HOT DOG.

16:48.866 --> 16:50.333
BUT WE ARE GOING TO SHOW IT TO

16:50.400 --> 17:05.733
YOU ANYWAY.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.266
>> John: MAGNIFICENT.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.000
NO DISRESPECT TO SEAGAL CLASSICS

17:07.066 --> 17:07.966
LIKE "UNDER SIEGE," "HARD TO

17:08.033 --> 17:09.300
KILL," "ABOVE THE LAW," AND

17:09.366 --> 17:10.700
PROBABLY SOMETHING CALLED

17:10.766 --> 17:12.500
"HUNTING THE FIRE" OR WHATEVER,

17:12.566 --> 17:14.833
BUT THAT IS THE GREATEST FILM

17:14.900 --> 17:17.500
STEVEN SEAGAL HAS EVER MADE.

17:17.566 --> 17:18.400
BUT FOR ALL LUKASHENKO'S

17:18.466 --> 17:19.566
COMMON-MAN POSTURING, HIS

17:19.633 --> 17:20.700
PROMISES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION

17:20.766 --> 17:23.066
QUICKLY FELL APART.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.500
JUST FIVE MONTHS INTO HIS

17:24.566 --> 17:26.533
PRESIDENCY, A DEPUTY COMPILED AN

17:26.600 --> 17:27.966
INVESTIGATION INTO CORRUPTION IN

17:28.033 --> 17:29.266
PARLIAMENT, WHICH WAS SAID TO

17:29.333 --> 17:30.033
HAVE CONTAINED CHARGES AGAINST

17:30.100 --> 17:32.400
VARIOUS HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS.

17:32.466 --> 17:34.033
BUT THE GOVERNMENT BANNED ALL

17:34.100 --> 17:36.400
PRESS COVERAGE OF THE REPORT, TO

17:36.466 --> 17:37.633
THE POINT WHERE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS

17:37.700 --> 17:38.800
THAT HAD PLANNED TO PUBLISH THE

17:38.866 --> 17:39.700
RESULTS OF IT, INSTEAD ENDED UP

17:39.766 --> 17:40.933
PUBLISHING BLANK PAGES LIKE

17:41.000 --> 17:42.766
THESE.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.366
AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING

17:44.433 --> 17:45.100
OF A DECADES-LONG ASSAULT ON THE

17:45.166 --> 17:46.366
PRESS.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.000
SHORTLY AFTERWARD, LUKASHENKO

17:48.066 --> 17:50.433
REPLACED THE EDITORS-IN-CHIEF OF

17:50.500 --> 17:51.633
FOUR LEADING NEWSPAPERS, AND

17:51.700 --> 17:52.833
TOOK THE NATIONAL RADIO AND

17:52.900 --> 17:54.333
TELEVISION UNDER STRICT CONTROL,

17:54.400 --> 17:56.433
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT SO

17:56.500 --> 17:58.566
HOSTILE TO INDEPENDENT

17:58.633 --> 17:59.100
JOURNALISM, BELARUS IS NOW

17:59.166 --> 18:00.833
CONSIDERED THE MOST DANGEROUS

18:00.900 --> 18:02.766
COUNTRY IN EUROPE FOR MEMBERS OF

18:02.833 --> 18:04.000
THE MEDIA -- WITH MEMBERS

18:04.066 --> 18:05.366
CONSTANTLY SUBJECTED TO

18:05.433 --> 18:06.466
VIOLENCE, ARBITRARY DETENTIONS,

18:06.533 --> 18:08.866
INTERROGATIONS, RAIDS AND MORE.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.600
AND THE CONTROL LUKASHENKO

18:10.666 --> 18:12.700
EXERTS OVER EVEN SMALL, PETTY

18:12.766 --> 18:15.900
DETAILS IS INCREDIBLE.

18:15.966 --> 18:17.466
>> IS IT TRUE THAT YOU CANNOT

18:17.533 --> 18:18.066
FILM THE BACK OF LUKASHENKO'S

18:18.133 --> 18:19.566
HEAD?

18:19.633 --> 18:21.233
>> YES, IT'S TRUE.

18:21.300 --> 18:21.833
>> IS IT BECAUSE HE HAS A BALD

18:21.900 --> 18:23.133
PATCH?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.566
>> YEAH, IT'S KIND OF VERY WEIRD

18:25.633 --> 18:27.233
HAIRCUT.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.666
SO IT'S GROWING FROM ONE SIDE.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.600
>> John: WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE

18:33.666 --> 18:36.033
TELLING ME THIS GUY IS BALD?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.333
THIS GUY?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
THIS GUY?

18:39.466 --> 18:41.266
THIS MAN RIGHT HERE?

18:41.333 --> 18:42.666
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THIS GUY

18:42.733 --> 18:43.833
IS BALD?

18:43.900 --> 18:46.266
BALD, YOU SAY?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

18:48.066 --> 18:49.400
RIGHT.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.366
IT LOOKS LIKE HE GREW HIS LEFT

18:51.433 --> 18:52.700
SIDEBURN INTO A RATTAIL AND THEN

18:52.766 --> 18:53.266
SHELLACKED IT ONTO HIS BARE

18:53.333 --> 18:55.566
SCALP.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.233
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "IS

18:57.300 --> 18:58.200
LUKASHENKO BALD," AT THIS POINT

18:58.266 --> 19:01.233
IS A RESOUNDING, "I WISH."

19:01.300 --> 19:02.666
BUT LUKASHENKO'S BIZARRE

19:02.733 --> 19:03.500
BEHAVIOR GOES WELL BEYOND

19:03.566 --> 19:05.300
CENSORING THE MEDIA AND

19:05.366 --> 19:06.200
FORCE-FEEDING STEVEN SEAGAL RAW

19:06.266 --> 19:07.466
VEGETABLES.

19:07.533 --> 19:08.700
OVER THE YEARS, HE'S MADE

19:08.766 --> 19:10.433
STATEMENTS LIKE, BETTER TO BE A

19:10.500 --> 19:12.200
DICTATOR THAN GAY, AND, "NOT

19:12.266 --> 19:14.866
EVERYTHING CONNECTED IN GERMANY

19:14.933 --> 19:15.566
WITH THE WELL-KNOWN ADOLF HITLER

19:15.633 --> 19:17.600
WAS BAD," TAKING THE PHRASE

19:17.666 --> 19:18.766
"PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE" A BIT

19:18.833 --> 19:20.766
TOO LITERALLY.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OKAY,

19:22.666 --> 19:23.566
BUT WHO DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY

19:23.633 --> 19:24.666
PRAISE HITLER IN THE '90s?"

19:24.733 --> 19:25.700
FIRST, WHY ARE YOU THINKING

19:25.766 --> 19:28.566
THAT?

19:28.633 --> 19:31.566
AND SECOND, JUST THIS SUMMER HE

19:31.633 --> 19:32.466
SAID THE ENTIRE WORLD "GROVELS

19:32.533 --> 19:34.566
TO THE JEWS."

19:34.633 --> 19:36.666
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY AWFUL.

19:36.733 --> 19:37.500
LUKASHENKO TREATS ANTI-SEMITISM

19:37.566 --> 19:38.133
THE WAY FASHION TREATS LOW-RISE

19:38.200 --> 19:39.900
BELL BOTTOMS.

19:39.966 --> 19:41.066
HE KEEPS BRINGING IT BACK EVEN

19:41.133 --> 19:43.133
WHEN IT WAS NEVER ACCEPTABLE AT

19:43.200 --> 19:47.233
ANY POINT IN HISTORY.

19:47.300 --> 19:47.900
OVERALL, LUKASHENKO OPERATES

19:47.966 --> 19:49.133
FROM THE STANDARD AUTHORITARIAN

19:49.200 --> 19:50.000
PLAYBOOK.

19:50.066 --> 19:52.000
AND HE'S REPEATEDLY WORKED TO

19:52.066 --> 19:53.766
CODIFY HIS POWER USING A

19:53.833 --> 19:55.333
CONTROVERSIAL REFERENDUM IN 1996

19:55.400 --> 19:56.500
TO EXTEND HIS FIRST TERM AND

19:56.566 --> 19:58.166
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE HIS POWERS

19:58.233 --> 19:59.333
AND WEAKEN THOSE OF THE

19:59.400 --> 20:01.666
LEGISLATURE, AND THEN USING A

20:01.733 --> 20:02.366
SECOND REFERENDUM TO COMPLETELY

20:02.433 --> 20:04.766
REMOVE TERM LIMITS IN 2004.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.400
AT THIS POINT, OUTSIDE OBSERVER

20:06.466 --> 20:08.800
GROUPS HAVE REPORTED THAT NONE

20:08.866 --> 20:10.533
OF HIS LAST FIVE ELECTION

20:10.600 --> 20:12.066
VICTORIES HAVE BEEN LEGITIMATE.

20:12.133 --> 20:13.300
AND THROUGHOUT HIS TIME AS

20:13.366 --> 20:14.266
PRESIDENT, LUKASHENKO HAS

20:14.333 --> 20:15.766
CLAMPED DOWN HARD ON THE

20:15.833 --> 20:18.666
SLIGHTEST SIGNS OF DISSENT.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.866
IN 2012, TWO MEN STAGED "TOY

20:20.933 --> 20:22.733
PROTESTS," WITH STUFFED ANIMALS

20:22.800 --> 20:25.366
HOLDING ANTI-LUKASHENKO SLOGANS,

20:25.433 --> 20:26.100
OBJECTIVELY THE CUTEST DISPLAY

20:26.166 --> 20:27.033
OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE I'VE EVER

20:27.100 --> 20:28.566
SEEN.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.266
BUT THAT WOUND UP GETTING BOTH

20:30.333 --> 20:33.066
THOSE MEN SENTENCED TO TEN DAYS

20:33.133 --> 20:34.500
IN JAIL, A SENTENCE THAT, IN

20:34.566 --> 20:35.266
ITSELF, ACTUALLY INSPIRED A

20:35.333 --> 20:38.166
FOLLOW-UP PROTEST.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.466
>> IN JULY, HUNDREDS OF TEDDY

20:39.533 --> 20:42.033
BEARS RAINED DOWN ON BELARUS.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.300
THEY WORE PARACHUTES AND CARRIED

20:43.366 --> 20:45.833
PRO-DEMOCRACY MESSAGES.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.866
THE MAN BEHIND THE PRANK IS A

20:47.933 --> 20:48.533
MARKETING EXECUTIVE WITH A

20:48.600 --> 20:49.833
SWEDISH FIRM.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.066
HE TOOK OFF FROM LITHUANIA IN

20:53.133 --> 20:54.400
THIS TINY PLANE.

20:54.466 --> 20:55.866
FOR 90 MINUTES, HE LET THE FUR

20:55.933 --> 20:56.333
FLY.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.200
>> John: PERFECT.

20:59.266 --> 20:59.733
I LOVE IT.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.900
TEN OUT OF TEN.

21:00.966 --> 21:01.900
WE SHOULD BE DROPPING

21:01.966 --> 21:02.833
PARACHUTING TEDDY BEARS FROM THE

21:02.900 --> 21:04.233
SKY HERE ALL THE TIME.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.233
NOT EVEN AS AN ACT OF PROTEST.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.533
IT SHOULD JUST BE A THING WE DO.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.733
"OH, IT'S 1:00 P.M., EVERYONE!

21:10.800 --> 21:11.300
IT'S DAILY PARACHUTING TEDDY

21:11.366 --> 21:12.666
BEAR TIME."

21:12.733 --> 21:14.133
WHY DID WE EVEN INVENT PLANES IF

21:14.200 --> 21:15.100
WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THEM TO

21:15.166 --> 21:16.700
DROP TEDDY BEARS OUT OF THE SKY

21:16.766 --> 21:17.366
AND INSTANTLY IMPROVE EVERYONE'S

21:17.433 --> 21:19.566
DAY?

21:19.633 --> 21:20.933
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SOCIETY

21:21.000 --> 21:22.566
WE'VE BUILT FOR OURSELVES.

21:22.633 --> 21:28.433
WE'RE FUCKING IDIOTS.

21:28.500 --> 21:28.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:28.966 --> 21:29.900
NOW, UNSURPRISINGLY, LUKASHENKO

21:29.966 --> 21:30.800
TRIED TO COVER THAT INCIDENT UP,

21:30.866 --> 21:31.633
WHICH PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE,

21:31.700 --> 21:34.900
DUE TO, YOU KNOW, THE INTERNET.

21:34.966 --> 21:36.300
SO INSTEAD, HE TRIED TO SAVE

21:36.366 --> 21:37.566
FACE BY FIRING TWO GENERALS --

21:37.633 --> 21:38.700
THE HEAD OF THE BORDER SERVICE

21:38.766 --> 21:40.533
AND THE HEAD OF THE AIR FORCE.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.266
BUT THE THING IS, EVEN THOUGH

21:42.333 --> 21:44.200
PROTESTS LIKE THOSE CAN BE

21:44.266 --> 21:46.633
WHIMSICAL, WHAT HAPPENS TO

21:46.700 --> 21:47.300
DISSIDENTS IN BELARUS IS

21:47.366 --> 21:48.800
HORRIFIC.

21:48.866 --> 21:50.166
OPPOSITION FIGURES HAVE

21:50.233 --> 21:51.533
DISAPPEARED OVER THE YEARS, AND

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
SOME ARE SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN

21:52.666 --> 21:54.666
MURDERED BY THE STATE.

21:54.733 --> 21:55.666
AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS

21:55.733 --> 21:56.866
ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL

21:56.933 --> 21:58.566
DETAINEES BEING TORTURED, AS

21:58.633 --> 22:00.400
THIS BBC JOURNALIST ONCE TRIED

22:00.466 --> 22:03.366
TO DEMONSTRATE, IN A PRETTY BOLD

22:03.433 --> 22:06.100
MANNER.

22:06.166 --> 22:09.366
>> THE OPPOSITION IN BELARUS SAY

22:09.433 --> 22:10.300
THEY WERE TORTURED BY BEING

22:10.366 --> 22:11.033
FORCED TO STRIP NAKED IN

22:11.100 --> 22:16.733
FREEZING CONDITIONS.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.366
>> SO WE GO TO A COLD STORE IN

22:18.433 --> 22:20.000
NORTH LONDON WHERE THE

22:20.066 --> 22:24.166
TEMPERATURE IS -24 CELSIUS.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.700
SO THE GUARDS FORCED THE

22:25.766 --> 22:28.633
PRISONERS TO STRIP NAKED AND

22:28.700 --> 22:29.966
STAND IN THIS POSITION,

22:30.033 --> 22:33.933
SPREAD-EAGLED.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.666
AT -20, THERE WAS SNOW OUTSIDE.

22:37.733 --> 22:38.700
IN THE JARGON OF TORTURE, THIS

22:38.766 --> 22:47.800
IS A STRESS POSITION.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.166
[LAUGHTER]

22:50.233 --> 22:51.166
>> John: QUICK QUESTION, AND IT

22:51.233 --> 22:53.966
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

22:54.033 --> 22:54.633
PRISONER TORTURE, WHY DID YOU DO

22:54.700 --> 22:57.100
THAT?

22:57.166 --> 22:58.033
YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD US THE

22:58.100 --> 22:59.066
PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO STAND

22:59.133 --> 23:00.766
IN THE COLD NAKED.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.666
WE'D HAVE BELIEVED YOU.

23:02.733 --> 23:03.400
AND WE'D HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

23:03.466 --> 23:05.666
IMAGINE WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE.

23:05.733 --> 23:07.500
WE REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO SEE YOU

23:07.566 --> 23:10.866
STANDING THERE, CAKES OUT, TO

23:10.933 --> 23:14.933
GET YOUR VERY BASIC POINT.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
AND THE THING IS, THAT BRUTALITY

23:16.066 --> 23:17.866
HAS ONLY ESCALATED.

23:17.933 --> 23:19.700
RECENTLY, LUKASHENKO HAS

23:19.766 --> 23:20.366
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS

23:20.433 --> 23:22.800
OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND

23:22.866 --> 23:23.533
JOURNALISTS, AND POLICE HAVE

23:23.600 --> 23:25.066
RAIDED THEIR OFFICES AND HOMES.

23:25.133 --> 23:26.100
JUST THIS WEEK, AN OPPOSITION

23:26.166 --> 23:27.033
LEADER WAS SENTENCED BY THE

23:27.100 --> 23:29.800
STATE TO 11 YEARS IN PRISON.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.966
AND EVEN WHEN DISSIDENTS MANAGE

23:32.033 --> 23:32.933
TO ESCAPE BELARUS, THEY MAY NOT

23:33.000 --> 23:34.500
BE SAFE.

23:34.566 --> 23:36.133
A FEW WEEKS AGO, AN ACTIVIST

23:36.200 --> 23:37.366
WHO'D FLED TO UKRAINE WENT OUT

23:37.433 --> 23:38.400
FOR A RUN AND WAS FOUND HANGED

23:38.466 --> 23:40.466
IN A PARK.

23:40.533 --> 23:41.200
AND WHILE THAT HASN'T BEEN

23:41.266 --> 23:46.066
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS MURDER

23:46.133 --> 23:46.833
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS MURDER,

23:46.900 --> 23:47.333
COME ON.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.833
I'M NOT SURE WHICH SPECIES OF

23:48.900 --> 23:49.600
TREES ARE NATIVE TO UKRAINE, BUT

23:49.666 --> 23:50.366
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM

23:50.433 --> 23:50.900
NATURALLY HAVE BELARUSIAN

23:50.966 --> 23:53.766
DISSIDENTS HANGING FROM THEM.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.666
THE POINT IS, FOR NEARLY THREE

23:54.733 --> 23:56.466
DECADES NOW, BELARUS HAS

23:56.533 --> 23:57.900
EXPERIENCED A BRUTAL CYCLE OF

23:57.966 --> 23:59.433
OPPRESSION IN WHICH LUKASHENKO

23:59.500 --> 24:01.200
WINS ELECTIONS THAT ARE NEITHER

24:01.266 --> 24:02.433
FREE NOR FAIR, LOCKS UP HIS

24:02.500 --> 24:04.133
POLITICAL OPPONENTS, PEOPLE TAKE

24:04.200 --> 24:05.333
TO THE STREETS IN PROTEST, AND

24:05.400 --> 24:07.633
HE VIOLENTLY CRACKS DOWN.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.900
IT'S NO WONDER THE BELARUSIAN

24:08.966 --> 24:11.200
PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.833
A LEAKED POLL SHOWED THAT ONLY

24:12.900 --> 24:13.766
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION

24:13.833 --> 24:15.466
TRUSTS LUKASHENKO.

24:15.533 --> 24:16.700
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVELY LOW,

24:16.766 --> 24:17.600
CONSIDERING, REMEMBER, HE

24:17.666 --> 24:20.366
CONTROLS THE NATIONAL MEDIA.

24:20.433 --> 24:22.200
AND EVEN THERE, HIS GRIP IS

24:22.266 --> 24:25.600
SLIPPING.

24:25.666 --> 24:26.166
LAST YEAR, PRESENTERS ON A

24:26.233 --> 24:27.200

LUKASHENKO MAY BE FEELING SOME

24:55.133 --> 24:57.000
SHOWED HIM HAVING ONLY 3%

25:37.233 --> 25:38.266
I'M NOT IN JAIL.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.766
AND SVIATLANA TSIKHANOUSKAYA --

25:41.833 --> 25:42.400
THE WOMAN WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE

25:42.466 --> 25:43.533
THE REAL WINNER OF LAST YEAR'S

25:43.600 --> 25:44.800
ELECTION, AND WHO, BY THE WAY,

25:44.866 --> 25:46.433
ONLY RAN AFTER HER HUSBAND,

25:46.500 --> 25:48.000
LUKASHENKO'S INITIAL OPPONENT,

25:48.066 --> 25:50.533
WAS IMPRISONED -- HAS FLED THE

25:50.600 --> 25:51.966
COUNTRY.

25:52.033 --> 25:52.666
BUT SHE'S STILL LEADING THE

25:52.733 --> 25:53.800
COUNTRY'S PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT

25:53.866 --> 25:55.166
FROM EXILE.

25:55.233 --> 25:56.266
SHE'S ASKED WORLD LEADERS TO

25:56.333 --> 25:57.800
DEMAND THE RELEASE OF WHAT'S

25:57.866 --> 25:58.533
THOUGHT TO BE OVER 650 POLITICAL

25:58.600 --> 26:00.966
PRISONERS.

26:01.033 --> 26:02.133
AND I WILL SAY, THE E.U., THE

26:02.200 --> 26:03.933
U.S., THE U.K. AND CANADA HAVE

26:04.000 --> 26:05.266
IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON BELARUS

26:05.333 --> 26:07.366
TARGETING EVERYTHING FROM CLOSE

26:07.433 --> 26:08.100
ASSOCIATES OF LUKASHENKO TO THE

26:08.166 --> 26:09.933
BELARUSIAN ECONOMY.

26:10.000 --> 26:10.766
AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS

26:10.833 --> 26:12.233
JUST RECENTLY IMPOSED MORE.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.500
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SANCTIONS CAN

26:14.566 --> 26:16.333
ONLY DO SO MUCH.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.766
AND LUKASHENKO DOESN'T SEEM KEEN

26:17.833 --> 26:19.333
TO END HIS REIGN.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.666
IN FACT, MANY THINK THAT HE'S

26:20.733 --> 26:22.500
GROOMED HIS YOUNGEST SON KOLYA

26:22.566 --> 26:23.933
TO TAKE HIS PLACE, BECAUSE SINCE

26:24.000 --> 26:26.433
HE WAS YOUNG, HE'S BEEN DRAGGING

26:26.500 --> 26:27.533
HIM ALONG EVERYWHERE HE GOES ON

26:27.600 --> 26:28.366
STATE BUSINESS.

26:28.433 --> 26:29.533
HERE HE IS.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.533
HERE HE IS AGAIN.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.733
HERE HE IS AGAIN.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.300
HE'S IN ALL OF THESE PHOTOS.

26:35.366 --> 26:35.933
I DON'T KNOW WHEN EUROPEAN

26:36.000 --> 26:37.433
"BRING YOUR KID TO WORK DAY" IS,

26:37.500 --> 26:40.566
BUT IT CAN'T BE "ALWAYS."

26:40.633 --> 26:42.333
SO AT THIS POINT, IT LOOKS LIKE

26:42.400 --> 26:43.600
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL REALLY

26:43.666 --> 26:45.433
IMPROVE THINGS IN BELARUS IS IF

26:45.500 --> 26:46.466
THE PEOPLE THERE SOMEHOW MANAGE

26:46.533 --> 26:47.400
TO REFORM THEIR CONSTITUTION AND

26:47.466 --> 26:48.766
ENSURE THAT FREE AND FAIR

26:48.833 --> 26:50.033
ELECTIONS ARE FINALLY HELD.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.066
AND AS WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

26:52.133 --> 26:53.300
FIGHTING FOR THOSE CHANGES IS

26:53.366 --> 26:55.333
GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY RISKY.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.233
BUT THERE MAY BE ONE EXTREMELY

26:57.300 --> 26:59.400
SMALL WAY THAT WE CAN HELP HERE,

26:59.466 --> 27:01.133
OR, IF NOT HELP, AT LEAST ANNOY

27:01.200 --> 27:02.733
THE SHIT OUT OF LUKASHENKO.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.966
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE

27:05.033 --> 27:06.166
KNOW HE HATES -- OTHER THAN GAY

27:06.233 --> 27:08.433
PEOPLE, JEWS, HIS OWN BALD HEAD,

27:08.500 --> 27:09.766
AND ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH

27:09.833 --> 27:12.033
HIM -- IT'S TEDDY BEARS.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.633
AND WHY WOULDN'T HE?

27:13.700 --> 27:14.466
I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM!

27:14.533 --> 27:15.933
THEY'RE EVERYTHING HE'S NOT --

27:16.000 --> 27:17.166
CUTE, LOVABLE, AND COVERED IN

27:17.233 --> 27:18.233
THICK, NATURAL, HAIR ALL THE WAY

27:18.300 --> 27:22.200
AROUND.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.833
SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE OUR OWN

27:24.900 --> 27:27.133
SPECIAL TEDDY BEAR IN HIS HONOR.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.733
AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S WEARING A

27:28.800 --> 27:30.300

27:30.366 --> 27:31.733

27:33.733 --> 27:34.366

SOMETHING ELSE, WHAT DOES THAT

27:36.666 --> 27:38.600
SAY ABOUT YOU?

27:38.666 --> 27:40.666
