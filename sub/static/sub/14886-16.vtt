[whirring]

02:11.865 --> 02:13.767
Oh, thank you, cousin.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.470
I thought it was gonna
suck my brains out.

02:17.504 --> 02:20.273
Balki, you're not gonna believe
what I got in the mail today.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.375
Your letter from
Publisher's Clearinghouse?

02:22.408 --> 02:24.377
You may already have won?

02:24.410 --> 02:27.213
No, no. But this
is almost as good.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.616
Balki, what
do I wanna be?

02:29.650 --> 02:30.584
Tall?

02:32.919 --> 02:35.188
What do I want
to do for a living?

02:35.221 --> 02:36.757
Be a photographer.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.660
Yes. And who inspired me
to become a photographer?

02:40.894 --> 02:41.828
No.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.631
Roger Morgan.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.233
Who that?

02:48.268 --> 02:50.904
"Who that?"
Roger Morgan?

02:50.937 --> 02:53.740
Well, he happens to be the best
photographer in the world.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.843
And this is an invitation for
Lawrence Appleton and a guest

02:56.877 --> 03:00.480
to the black tie opening night
party of his new photo exhibit.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.783
Everybody who's anybody in
the photobiz will be there.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.651
Get out of the city!

03:06.553 --> 03:08.555
‐ Why would he invite you?
‐ Well, I'll be..

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
Because I was
one of the winners

03:12.659 --> 03:14.427
of the Chicago Gazette
Photo Contest

03:14.460 --> 03:16.329
and Roger Morgan
was one of the judges.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.666
Oh‐h‐h, cousin!

03:19.700 --> 03:21.868
‐ That's nice.
‐ Now, Balki.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.971
Balki, Balki, it is
more than just nice.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.840
I‐it's like me wanting
to be a baseball player

03:26.873 --> 03:28.709
and meeting Pete Rose.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.276
Or me wanting
to be an actor

03:30.310 --> 03:31.812
and meeting
Laurence Olivier.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.247
Is it like me meeting

03:34.280 --> 03:36.817
the great sheepherder
Zimdog Zakibatbat?

03:36.850 --> 03:39.720
Yes. Yes!

03:39.753 --> 03:42.255
Then this is
an exciting day for you!

03:42.288 --> 03:44.290
Yes. Yes, it is.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.492
And I'm glad I could
share it with you.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.563
Oh, cousin, a party!
I love a party!

03:49.596 --> 03:52.265
We can, we can play
pin the tail on the mule

03:52.298 --> 03:53.600
and we can
bob for potatoes

03:53.634 --> 03:55.035
and we can do
the Limbo Rock.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.871
‐ When you do the‐‐
‐ No, Balki. Balki.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.640
I‐I think you misunderstood.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.708
I'm sharing my
happiness with you

04:01.742 --> 04:03.610
but I'm sharing
the evening with Jennifer.

04:05.045 --> 04:05.979
Jennifer?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.884
Why you ask Jennifer?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.686
Because she's beautiful
and I want her.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.454
That's a good point.
Very good point.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.624
But I want you to know,
if she couldn't go

04:17.658 --> 04:18.759
you were next on my list.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.927
Oh‐h‐h! Oh‐h‐h.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.600
Mr. Twinkacetti,
can you believe it?

04:26.633 --> 04:29.970
Cousin Larry and Jennifer
are going to a black tie party!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.738
Color me excited.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.643
Alright, you tell him
it was your fault.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.911
It was a simple mistake.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.345
"Simple mistake?"

04:39.379 --> 04:40.781
Alright, I'm a simple person.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.049
Is that what you
wanted to hear me say?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.586
Ladies, ladies, why
the stormy weather?

04:47.420 --> 04:49.322
Larry, I can't go to
the party tomorrow night.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.857
‐ I'm working.
‐ Working?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.392
But you were gonna
fly to New York tonight

04:52.425 --> 04:53.259
and be back tomorrow.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.928
That's what I thought,
but Mary Anne

04:54.961 --> 04:56.797
got our destinations mixed up.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.900
We're not going to New York,
we're going to New Zealand.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.304
New York, New Zealand.
It could happen to anybody.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.475
You're going
to New Zealand?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.311
The sheep capital
of the world?

05:13.079 --> 05:14.948
How lucky can you get?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.084
See?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.356
We won't be back
till after your party.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.659
I'm so sorry, Larry,
I feel terrible.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.662
I just hope you can find
someone else to go with you.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.565
Well, we better get going.
We've got a lot to pack.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.866
We're comin' back
through New Delhi.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.537
You didn't tell me
anything about New Delhi.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.505
I don't know anything
about New Delhi.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.686
Uh, who did you say
was next on your list?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.490
[instrumental music]

06:06.833 --> 06:08.068
Balki!

06:08.101 --> 06:10.671
I got the tuxedos
for the party tonight.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.006
Cousin, I'm ready to party.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.543
Now tell me..

06:17.978 --> 06:19.412
...how do I look?

06:26.887 --> 06:27.821
[clears throat]

06:29.556 --> 06:31.424
Balki, you're
not going to meet

06:31.457 --> 06:33.093
Roger Morgan
dressed like that.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.595
Why not?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.029
Because this is
a black tie party

06:36.062 --> 06:37.798
not a...bullfight.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.067
But I'm wearing
a black tie.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.170
Balki, black tie means
you have to wear a tuxedo.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.707
Well, of course, it does.
Don't be ridiculous.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.575
‐ I'll go splash some on.
‐ No, Balki.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.014
This...is a tuxedo.

06:54.047 --> 06:54.981
Oh.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.084
I don't have
one of that.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.485
I know that.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.454
That's why I
got this for you.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.524
Oh, cousin.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.792
It's beautiful.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.460
You shouldn't have
bought this for me.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.664
I didn't.
I rented it.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.567
You paid somebody money
so I could wear his clothes?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.538
Yes.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.205
But I already
have clothes.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.876
Ah, but not...like...these.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.746
‐ Yours?
‐ Yes.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.948
Yours looks just like mine.

07:27.981 --> 07:28.715
Yes.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.252
But if we dressed
exactly alike

07:32.285 --> 07:34.220
how would people
tell us apart?

07:37.023 --> 07:38.491
Dental records.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.199
Balki..

07:47.701 --> 07:48.835
...believe me

07:48.869 --> 07:49.870
'this is not the kind of party'

07:49.903 --> 07:51.705
where you're
supposed to have...fun.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.842
Let me get this straight.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.243
Uh‐huh.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.845
Everybody is going to
be wearing black suits.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.046
Yes.

08:00.080 --> 08:00.914
And nobody's
gonna have any fun?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.148
Yes.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.784
What the difference
is between this party

08:03.817 --> 08:04.985
and a funeral?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.487
There's no body.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.991
But I can fix that.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.663
Balki, this party is
very important to me.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.499
It is vital that
we behave properly.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.770
Roger Morgan has been known
to take young photographers

08:23.804 --> 08:26.940
under his wing and make
them what they are today.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.709
What are they today?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.512
Photographers.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.916
[gasps]
That's what
you want to be.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.784
Yes. Yes, it is.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.552
[chuckles]

08:42.789 --> 08:45.959
Balki, look, so you
know what to expect

08:45.992 --> 08:47.093
why don't we pretend
that the living room

08:47.127 --> 08:48.795
is the gallery, alright?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.564
There are photographs
on the walls

08:50.597 --> 08:52.165
important people
standing around

08:52.198 --> 08:53.934
we both have drinks.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.069
We're looking
at a photograph.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.170
Someone comes up
and asks‐‐

08:57.203 --> 08:58.939
What kind of
drink do I have?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.077
What kind of drink
would you like?

09:04.110 --> 09:06.613
Cola, please.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.682
‐ You have a cola.
‐ Cola.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.952
‐ Someone comes up‐‐
‐ You have a diet?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.186
You have diet?

09:14.621 --> 09:16.289
You have a diet cola.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.091
‐ Uh‐h‐h.
‐ Someone comes up‐‐

09:18.124 --> 09:19.225
Y‐you don't
have caffeine free?

09:19.259 --> 09:20.694
You have a caffeine

09:20.727 --> 09:23.964
(both)
free diet cola.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.165
‐ Someone comes up‐‐
‐ Unless you got a ginger ale.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.232
But I..

09:29.169 --> 09:31.071
No drinks,
we have no drinks.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.072
‐ We have a little pretzel‐‐
‐ No.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.306
Or a chip of some kind?

09:33.339 --> 09:36.342
No. No food,
no drinks. Nothing.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.245
We are standing here

09:39.279 --> 09:41.247
looking at a photograph.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.016
Oh‐h‐h! Puppy dogs.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.223
Fine.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.026
Someone comes
up and asks

09:53.059 --> 09:54.661
"What do you think
of this photograph?"

09:54.695 --> 09:55.862
I think it's pretty.

09:55.896 --> 09:56.630
Wrong.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.067
I think it's...ugly.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.035
Wrong.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.108
I think it's..

10:08.141 --> 10:10.076
...pretty ugly.
Ha ha ha!

10:22.923 --> 10:24.424
Is this how
you're going to act

10:24.457 --> 10:26.159
when you meet
Roger Morgan?

10:26.192 --> 10:27.360
‐ No, I'll be good.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.129
Boy, are you strict.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.066
Yes, I am.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.803
Balki, at this
kind of party

10:36.837 --> 10:39.372
it doesn't matter
what you think.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.408
What matters is that they
think you think what they think.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.409
‐ Got it?
‐ I don't think so.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.377
Alright.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.914
Let me make it
simple for you.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.315
When they ask you
what you think

10:49.349 --> 10:50.684
you ask them
what they think

10:50.717 --> 10:53.119
and then tell them
the same thing.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.721
But they already
know what they think.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.289
Exactly.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.458
And they wanna hear
the same thing from you.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.393
So let's try it again.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.362
We're looking at picture.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.330
Balki, where are you going?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.434
I'm choosing a new picture.
It's enough with puppies.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.736
Yeah, this is the one.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.214
What do you think
of this picture?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.283
Well, I‐I...I..

11:23.316 --> 11:25.418
What do you think?

11:25.451 --> 11:26.452
I like it.
How about you?

11:26.486 --> 11:29.055
‐ I like it too.
‐ Very good.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.096
Alright, let's
try on your tuxedo.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.864
Cousin, are you
sure this is the way

11:37.898 --> 11:39.099
people act at
these parties?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.067
Balki, of course,
I'm sure.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.335
Trust me.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.104
This is just
a game you play

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
to get your foot
in the door.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.874
Don't worry.
I won't embarrass you.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.075
Mm‐hmm.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.844
You're gonna
be proud of me.

11:58.985 --> 11:59.720
[rips]

12:04.124 --> 12:06.126
I guessed at the size.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.360
Guess again.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.963
[instrumental music]

12:13.133 --> 12:15.368
[instrumental music]

12:22.008 --> 12:23.977
[indistinct chattering]

12:24.010 --> 12:25.979
[instrumental music]

12:26.012 --> 12:28.749
[indistinct chattering]

12:43.129 --> 12:45.165
I'm sorry the tuxedo
place was closed.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.367
Me too.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.939
But I‐I don't mind
being a little different.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.975
I'm proud of my heritage.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.877
Okay. Be proud.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.144
Just..

12:58.178 --> 12:59.445
...stand behind me.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.187
Which one's Roger Morgan?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.022
Well, I don't see him.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.857
Oh, look, that's
Frank Lambert.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.527
He's the photo editor
of "Shutter" magazine.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.596
And that's Dick Jorgeson.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.130
He won a Pulitzer Prize
last year.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.600
'Oh, there's Margaret Milgram.'

13:19.633 --> 13:21.868
'She owns the gallery.'

13:21.902 --> 13:24.270
Balki, I never thought
I'd be rubbing elbows

13:24.304 --> 13:25.471
with so many
important people.

13:25.506 --> 13:27.440
I'd love to rub
those elbows.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
It's an expression.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.446
Don't rub anything.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.853
‐ Let's mingle.
‐ But does‐‐

13:39.886 --> 13:41.254
It means talk
without touching.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.223
Without touching.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.966
"Hitchhiker on
the Road to Bitterness."

13:52.999 --> 13:54.200
Hmm.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.168
You know, I think
it's the essence

13:55.201 --> 13:58.438
of Roger's best work.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.541
‐ Do you really think so?
‐ Yes, I do.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.178
What do you..

14:09.049 --> 14:09.983
...think?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.019
‐ What do I think?
‐ 'Yes.'

14:13.053 --> 14:15.088
‐ What do I think?
‐ 'Yes.'

14:15.121 --> 14:17.558
I think it's the best
of his essence too.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.530
We have a calendar
of all his work at home.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.901
This is September.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.605
A calendar?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.507
Yes, it's right
over the toilet.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.681
A toilet? Please!

14:40.714 --> 14:42.516
Oh, it's right out
the door to your left.

14:45.018 --> 14:45.786
Well, I never‐‐

14:45.819 --> 14:47.320
Well, in that case
let me suggest

14:47.353 --> 14:48.388
a high‐fiber diet.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.459
Dennis, I need a drink.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.207
New rule.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.611
Don't say anything

15:10.644 --> 15:13.213
unless you've got something
caught in your throat.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.284
But, cousin, I was just
agreeing with her like you said.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.020
Don't you think
it's a good picture?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
(Larry)
'Yes, it's a good picture.'

15:21.387 --> 15:23.323
All his pictures are good.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.125
I looked at this one
all through September.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.729
I think it
might've been better

15:28.762 --> 15:30.964
if he'd shot it
with a wide angle lens.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.633
Would've made the car
seem little further away

15:32.666 --> 15:34.200
a little more desolate.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.036
Boy, you know a lot

15:36.069 --> 15:37.938
for a guy who's
never sold a picture.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.475
Thank you.

15:44.545 --> 15:46.146
You know,
I always wondered

15:46.179 --> 15:47.714
why he only shoots
in black and white.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.016
Uh, sir?

15:52.118 --> 15:52.653
Thank you.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.491
Balki, give the man
back his tray.

16:00.661 --> 16:02.563
‐ He give it to me.
‐ Balki.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.666
Just take one thing

16:05.699 --> 16:07.634
and let the waiter
serve the other guests.

16:11.738 --> 16:12.673
Thank you.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.376
What this?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.544
Those are
finger sandwiches.

16:23.517 --> 16:24.484
No, Balki.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.121
Balki.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.690
Balki, they're not
what you think.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.593
Just take something.

16:32.626 --> 16:33.594
[breathes heavily]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.365
Uh, perhaps
a cocktail frank?

16:39.399 --> 16:41.301
Oh. My name's not Frank.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.136
It's Balki.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.072
And I think cocktails are
those little drinks over there.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.677
Thank you.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.312
I'll try to remember that.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.521
You know, you'd think
they'd get a waiter

17:00.554 --> 17:03.489
who knew what
he was doing.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.258
Yes. You‐you'd
think they would.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.461
Oh, good to see you too.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.463
‐ Margaret, how are ya?
‐ Roger.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.365
‐ So good to see you.
‐ Well, it's good to be here.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.300
Balki, that's him.
That's Roger Morgan.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.671
Cousin, he's not
wearing a black tie.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.740
No wonder everyone
is staring at him.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.208
(Larry)
'Alright. This is it.'

17:23.143 --> 17:24.578
Oh. S‐sweaty palms.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.146
What if he wants
to shake hands?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.480
Alright. Oh, ah..

17:29.249 --> 17:30.684
‐ Mr. Morgan.
‐ Yes?

17:30.717 --> 17:34.120
Oh, oh, it is such
a measure to pleet you.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.488
I..

17:35.522 --> 17:38.692
I‐I‐I'm Larry‐Larry‐Larry..

17:38.725 --> 17:39.760
‐ Appleton.
‐ ...Appleton.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.828
And I‐I was won,
I was won, I was‐‐

17:41.862 --> 17:43.296
Uh, do you have something
caught in your throat?

17:43.329 --> 17:44.531
No. No.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.266
No, I'm fine.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.868
You know, Mr. Morgan,
I've always wondered

17:47.901 --> 17:49.703
why do you only
shoot black and white?

17:49.736 --> 17:50.704
Well‐‐

17:50.737 --> 17:51.805
Cousin Larry was wondering that.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.406
You were wondering
the same thing.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.375
Weren't you, cousin?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.142
Excuse us.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.215
Well, that's it.
It's over.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.817
The man obviously
thinks I'm an idiot.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.819
No, he doesn't, cousin.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.821
He‐he might think
you talk a little funny

18:07.854 --> 18:10.857
and, well, who
could blame him?

18:10.891 --> 18:13.359
But he hasn't met
the real Larry Appleton.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.795
The one who speaks English.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.262
Now come on,
let's go play the game.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.632
No, no, I can't go
back over to him again.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.333
I had my chance
and I blew it.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.168
Oh, you just try again.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.403
I can't.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.638
Yes, you can!

18:24.671 --> 18:26.873
Cousin, if I was
standing there

18:26.907 --> 18:29.643
and the great Zimdog Zakibatbat
was over there..

18:31.712 --> 18:33.714
...I would hope
you would do this.

18:33.747 --> 18:36.182
No, Balki, Balki! Alright,
put me down. Put me down..

18:36.216 --> 18:38.418
Balki, put me down.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.385
Mr. Morgan..

18:40.687 --> 18:42.623
...my Cousin Larry, again.

18:42.656 --> 18:44.758
Yes, I remember.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.531
He...he admires you.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.198
I do, I really do.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.166
Thank you.

18:54.668 --> 18:55.602
And he..

18:57.370 --> 19:00.206
...would like to be as
great as you are some day.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.808
I would, I would.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.945
You know, that's the great
thing about photography

19:04.978 --> 19:06.713
it's a non‐verbal medium.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.317
[no audio]

19:15.889 --> 19:18.391
‐ The hitchhiker picture.
‐ Yes.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.393
Don't you think you took
it with the wrong lens?

19:20.426 --> 19:22.663
[gasps]

19:22.696 --> 19:25.699
Mr. Morgan doesn't do
anything with the wrong lens.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.933
‐ Dennis‐‐
‐ Don't worry, Mr. Morgan.

19:26.967 --> 19:29.369
I'll take care
of these people.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.737
Margaret.

19:30.771 --> 19:31.705
Margaret?

19:33.373 --> 19:35.776
Don't mind Dennis, he was
born with a silver spoon

19:35.809 --> 19:36.543
in his mouth.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.614
Must have been
painful for his mama.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.919
[laughing]

19:45.952 --> 19:47.320
Excuse us again.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.828
Do you have any idea
what you just said?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.429
I was just trying to help.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.931
Well, you didn't.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.700
Morgan no longer
thinks I'm an idiot

19:59.733 --> 20:01.301
he knows I'm an idiot.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.436
And that I come from
a family of idiots.

20:04.705 --> 20:07.974
Cousin, I‐I‐I am
trying as hard as I can!

20:08.008 --> 20:10.777
I don't understand
these strange social rules.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.746
Thinking one thing
and saying another.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.981
People should
just be themselves.

20:15.015 --> 20:16.850
Except Dennis, he
should be somebody else.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.788
You're right.
I'm sorry we even came.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.791
Those are they.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.597
Pardon me, but how
did you get in here?

20:30.631 --> 20:32.733
‐ He's with me.
‐ I was talking to you.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.736
I was invited.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.671
And I'm his invited guest.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.006
Well, I'm uninviting
both of you.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.642
You're a blithering fool.

20:43.777 --> 20:46.747
And you...you come
here dressed like a..

20:46.780 --> 20:49.916
...like a matador...
and proceed to utter

20:49.950 --> 20:51.752
the most tactless
inane dribble I've ever‐‐

20:51.785 --> 20:53.053
Now, w‐wait‐wait a minute.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.788
He is not being tactless.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.489
He's being honest.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.824
He's the only one in
the room with the‐the guts

20:57.858 --> 20:58.892
to say what he thinks.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.694
And don't put
down his clothes.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.763
He is proud
of his heritage.

21:02.796 --> 21:05.465
No one speaks
to her like that.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.801
Well, I'm sorry,
but your nana was being rude.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.509
His nana?

21:18.344 --> 21:19.479
I'm calling security.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.447
Dennis, really.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.618
You're in trouble.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.288
Come on, Balki,
let's get outta here.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.323
Oh, there you are.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.659
Uh, young man,
about that lens comment..

21:32.693 --> 21:34.060
Oh, Mr. Morgan, please

21:34.094 --> 21:37.397
he was only repeating
a stupid remark he heard me say.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.932
Oh, but it wasn't stupid.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.868
It was a very
perceptive comment.

21:41.902 --> 21:43.704
Well, it's what
I really thought

21:43.737 --> 21:44.905
I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

21:44.938 --> 21:46.573
‐ Not now anyway.
‐ 'Yes.'

21:48.809 --> 21:51.077
What lens would
you have used?

21:51.111 --> 21:53.079
Well, I guess, I
would have used a 28 mm.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.716
That's exactly
the lens I was gonna use.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.018
But my camera bag
was locked in the car..

21:58.051 --> 21:59.620
...along with my keys.

21:59.653 --> 22:02.022
Oh‐h‐h! Po po!

22:03.690 --> 22:05.491
Cousin Larry does
that all the time.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.798
It's refreshing to
hear an honest criticism.

22:11.832 --> 22:13.634
Usually when I ask
people what they think

22:13.667 --> 22:15.602
they turn around and say,
"What do you think?"

22:15.636 --> 22:17.370
[laughing]

22:19.906 --> 22:21.407
I hate that.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.045
Uh, Larry, uh..

22:25.078 --> 22:26.046
What was the name again?

22:26.079 --> 22:27.548
‐ Appleton.
‐ Larry Appleton.

22:27.581 --> 22:29.816
Cousin Larry won tenth
place in the photo contest

22:29.850 --> 22:31.384
that you had to judge.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.520
Appleton. I remember
the picture.

22:33.554 --> 22:35.421
‐ You do? My picture?
‐ 'Yes.'

22:35.455 --> 22:37.390
If the committee had
listened to my opinion

22:37.423 --> 22:39.626
you would have done
better than tenth place.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.127
Well, Mr. Morgan,
you have no idea

22:41.161 --> 22:42.596
how that makes me feel.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.931
Well, I was a beginner
once too, you know?

22:44.965 --> 22:47.000
You've got a good eye, Appleton.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.001
I'd like to see some
more of your work.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.402
Really?

22:49.435 --> 22:50.937
Drop some pictures
by the hotel.

22:50.971 --> 22:52.105
Maybe I can be
of help to you.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.740
Well, thank you.

22:53.774 --> 22:54.975
Nice outfit, kid.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.845
Very Myposian.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.049
[speaking in Myposian]

23:05.852 --> 23:08.589
[instrumental music]

23:15.729 --> 23:18.464
I can't believe it. Roger Morgan
is gonna look at my pictures

23:18.498 --> 23:19.666
and cry.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.201
I'll bring him these.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.936
I can't bring him that.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.905
Maybe this.
What do you think?

23:26.172 --> 23:28.108
What do you think?

23:30.210 --> 23:32.212
No, Balki, we're not
at the gallery anymore.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.214
I really need your opinion.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.816
No, you don't.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.651
Cousin, everybody
has an opinion.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.686
Me, Roger Morgan

23:39.720 --> 23:41.454
even Dennis
and his nana.

23:43.557 --> 23:45.626
But the only one
that matters is yours.

23:45.659 --> 23:48.629
Now bring Mr. Morgan
the ones you like best.

23:50.030 --> 23:50.997
Yeah.

23:51.031 --> 23:51.965
You're right.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.201
Come on, Balki.

23:55.235 --> 23:57.838
I wanna bring these
over to his hotel.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.006
Boy, this could be great.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.142
If Roger Morgan
likes these

24:02.175 --> 24:03.677
I could be working
in a newspaper

24:03.710 --> 24:04.811
in a couple of weeks.

24:04.845 --> 24:07.581
I could be in a new apartment
in a couple of months.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.481
In a year..

24:09.750 --> 24:11.117
...I could win a Pulitzer.

24:12.586 --> 24:13.820
And if he
doesn't like them?

24:13.854 --> 24:14.888
I'll jump off
the Sears Tower.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.757
Cousin..

24:16.790 --> 24:19.159
...don't you think you're
getting a little crazy again?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.927
Isn't there somewhere
in the middle?

24:23.296 --> 24:24.030
You're right.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.901
How about...I give
him the pictures

24:27.934 --> 24:29.803
and hope for the best?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.838
I second that emotion.

24:31.872 --> 24:34.808
[instrumental music]

24:38.779 --> 24:41.047
[theme music]

25:03.604 --> 25:06.139
[music continues]
