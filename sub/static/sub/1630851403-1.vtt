00:07.520 --> 00:10.200
SICILY

00:12.840 --> 00:15.360
AFTER THE MAFIA MASSACRES IN THE '90S

00:15.440 --> 00:17.920
THE ANTI-MAFIA MOVEMENT FOUGHT BACK

00:18.440 --> 00:22.440
JUDGES AND JOURNALISTS
HAD A LEADING ROLE IN THIS FIGHT

00:27.520 --> 00:30.720
BUT ARE THEY ALL REAL HEROES?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.600
Journalists in mafia territory

00:37.040 --> 00:38.240
make a lot of enemies.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.680
Every time I get into my car and start it,
I close my eyes.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.880
Because I never know
if I'll get blown to pieces.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.040
I'm a judge.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.200
If I hadn't had a bodyguard,
I'd be dead for sure.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.400
One bullet doesn't cost
the Mafia anything.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.000
I have dedicated my whole working life

01:13.600 --> 01:16.760
to fighting the Mafia in Sicily.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.640
I've seized assets worth billions.
Billions!

01:24.320 --> 01:28.960
We have discovered, however,
that by claiming it fights the Mafia,

01:29.040 --> 01:31.520
the anti-Mafia movement
keeps getting richer.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.680
Judge Saguto, I have a question.
This money, does it get set aside,

01:36.760 --> 01:39.280
or is it appropriated left,
right and center?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.800
This theft of confiscated goods…

01:41.880 --> 01:43.040
You're avoiding the questions…

01:43.120 --> 01:47.400
We've called you "thieves,"
"vultures," and "criminals."

01:49.280 --> 01:51.960
He'll give up. He'll give up.
His hours are numbered.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.800
-Who?
-The Moustache.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.120
Pino Maniaci is not a journalist.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.680
He's a friend of the Mafia.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.280
He's a mafioso. He threatened me.
Go to the police then, you motherfucker.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.480
I'd never thought my colleagues
would believe Maniaci's accusations.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.480
Corrupt judges! Thieves!
The anti-Mafia Mafia!

02:16.200 --> 02:17.040
I thought that…

02:17.600 --> 02:20.120
my colleagues were crazy,
and I was furious.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.840
They came to get me
at the TV station at 3 in the morning,

02:25.920 --> 02:27.040
two police captains.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.520
I want to understand why.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.800
COURT OF LAW

02:33.240 --> 02:34.480
They used me…

02:36.880 --> 02:38.840
as a sacrificial lamb.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.320
If you want to stop me,

02:43.880 --> 02:45.200
you have two options,

02:45.720 --> 02:46.560
arrest me,

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
or shoot me.

A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

03:33.480 --> 03:34.840
NEWSROOM

03:35.640 --> 03:37.160
A lot changed in my life

03:38.760 --> 03:41.600
in 1999, when I took over Telejato.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.840
I was enthusiastic and motivated
to make positive changes…

03:51.800 --> 03:54.120
to this country that I love and adore.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.280
See what they're bringing me first,
what they want.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.640
-Where's my jacket?
-It's here, it's here.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.680
Letizia!

04:05.400 --> 04:06.680
Shit, that's the old one.

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
It's fine.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
Letizia!

04:15.360 --> 04:18.200
Let's get it all out.
Give me all the sheets from the printer.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.840
This is Telejato,

04:26.280 --> 04:28.400
I run it with my wife and my children,

04:29.040 --> 04:30.200
and my dogs too.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.040
Letizia came to help out straight away,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.600
without a second thought,

04:37.680 --> 04:41.000
and she followed me in this…
in this adventure.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.760
Go on. Move slowly.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.920
I'm proud to be
Pino Maniaci's daughter.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.120
I spent my adolescence here,
at the TV station.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.240
And… so I went to school,
and then I helped my dad.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.840
It started as just for fun,

05:04.920 --> 05:06.440
the first few times,

05:06.520 --> 05:09.320
then it became a passion,
and now it's my job.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.200
Letizia, let's get this out.
Let's get this out now. Come on.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.560
At first, I couldn't stand him,

05:17.160 --> 05:18.400
he was annoying.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.320
And then, I don't know how it happened.
They say love is blind.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.320
Some people like him,
others don't.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.360
It's because of his direct nature,
you know?

05:37.320 --> 05:41.680
But all we're doing is telling the truth,
how things really are.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.880
We were still using video recorders.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.480
We didn't know what a computer was.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.800
In the beginning, Telejato was nothing.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.520
Pino started with Telejato

06:04.600 --> 06:06.600
after doing several different jobs.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.640
He was even a builder.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.640
He started with Telejato
for financial reasons.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.800
He's developed it so much that…

06:19.120 --> 06:24.200
that his true personality
came through with Telejato.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.840
He wants to be famous.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.840
Telejato.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.800
He wanted to be an orchestra conductor.
He loves an audience. He's eccentric.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.640
We've built the foundation

06:45.160 --> 06:49.680
for Telejato's new home,
next to Rai and Mediaset.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.960
He comes across as aggressive,

06:54.040 --> 06:57.960
someone who walks all over people,
but he's a good man.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.120
He's not a saint, of course.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.120
I don't want to point any fingers
or judge him because he's my brother,

07:07.200 --> 07:09.600
but… he doesn't like injustice,

07:10.480 --> 07:12.640
and he won't let people walk all over him.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.480
When I found out
that Telejato reached Corleone,

07:23.280 --> 07:25.400
the hometown of the Mafia bosses,

07:26.680 --> 07:28.960
of Totò Riina and Provenzano,

07:30.880 --> 07:34.000
for me, it was a starting point of saying,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.280
"We're in the right place
to try to fuck with the Mafia,"

07:41.600 --> 07:44.480
and show that we weren't scared
of those pieces of shit.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.240
TELEJATO NEWS

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
APRIL 2006

07:51.320 --> 07:52.560
This special edition

07:53.520 --> 07:56.480
is in regard to the arrest
of Binnu Provenzano…

08:00.200 --> 08:04.440
The biggest story was
the capture of Binnu Provenzano.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.080
He was considered the boss of the bosses.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.520
After years on the run,
he was caught in Corleone.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.960
Provenzano was known as "The Tractor"

08:26.600 --> 08:28.200
because of his firepower.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.080
He would run people down without mercy.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.680
There were years where they stopped
counting dead people in Palermo.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.320
There were hundreds.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.120
STATE POLICE

08:46.280 --> 08:50.840
One of the policemen called me,
practically as he was handcuffing him,

08:50.920 --> 08:53.720
he said,
"Come here and I'll give you the scoop

08:53.800 --> 08:55.880
on the arrest of the boss of the bosses."

08:59.400 --> 09:01.240
I remember I was at work.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.560
Letizia came to get me.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.160
-"We have to go to Palermo."
-"What for?"

09:08.240 --> 09:11.160
-"They've arrested Binnu Provenzano."
-"Wow! Let's go!"

09:11.240 --> 09:13.040
We were really happy,

09:14.360 --> 09:16.080
so we left immediately.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.160
We're coming into the area,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.720
the kingdom of the boss of the bosses.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.680
Sorry, watch out,
I'm putting the turbo on.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.920
No, all of Telejato is here.
If they shoot us, Telejato will shut down.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.360
Letizia, look.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.080
PROVENZANO'S HIDEOUT

10:04.880 --> 10:07.680
The ghost of Corleone
isn't a ghost anymore.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.280
He's now in the hands of justice.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.520
Let's film the TV antenna.
No one realized Provenzano had a TV.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.520
Look. He might have watched Telejato.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.280
Partinico is a town
with a lot of mafiosos.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.880
There is a long history of Mafia here.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.480
And it's a town which has had
organized crime for a long time,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.560
so it's somewhere where there's no lack
of work for criminal lawyers.

10:52.160 --> 10:55.400
Telejato built itself
around the anti-Mafia movement.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.480
A TV station like that stands out.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.760
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.560
Today is an important day.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.840
Today is the birthday
of that piece of shit,

11:16.560 --> 11:18.800
Matteo Messina Soldino,

11:19.320 --> 11:21.040
who is still on the run.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.360
Matteo Messina Soldino,

11:25.840 --> 11:27.800
you are 54 today.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.560
Turn yourself in, you piece of shit.
You're practically not even a man anymore.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.440
Pino is vulgar, he's rude.

11:37.960 --> 11:42.080
As you can see from the pictures,
the motherfuckers had a comfortable life.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.040
Extremely rude.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.960
Can you imagine 30,000 people farting?

11:48.920 --> 11:51.960
But he got big audiences
and lots of attention.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.760
In a short space of time,
it became the most popular TV channel.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.760
-Can I buy you a coffee?
-Another time, thanks.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.880
It's just that he's also
very irresponsible.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.640
Over the last few days, we've reported on
how the Mafia has been pressuring

12:17.720 --> 12:18.840
local business owners.

12:18.920 --> 12:19.840
MAY 2006

12:22.200 --> 12:25.440
Paying the pizzo
is paying a bribe to the Mafia.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.120
And of course, we keep saying,
"Don't pay it. Don't pay the pizzo."

12:33.840 --> 12:38.320
A COMMUNITY THAT PAYS THE PIZZO
IS A COMMUNITY WITHOUT DIGNITY

12:42.080 --> 12:44.080
Hey! My car!

12:50.400 --> 12:55.000
The Vitale family is
the most famous Mafia family in Partinico.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.120
They are known as "Fardazza,"

13:01.360 --> 13:03.560
which means scum.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.680
They would kill people

13:07.760 --> 13:12.200
just for breathing,
and no one could match their power.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.000
People were scared
to even talk about them.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.000
We want to tell you a story,
a story about a small village

13:28.080 --> 13:32.560
on the outskirts of Partinico,
which is controlled by the Vitale family.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.720
JULY 2006

13:36.800 --> 13:39.960
Many homicides have taken place
in this village.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.360
A man was killed in this house…

13:47.680 --> 13:51.720
because he stood up
to the Vitale family's excessive power.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.560
In just one night, the Vitale family
destroyed a 17th-century village.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.760
Hello, gorgeous.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.920
They destroyed everything
to build five huge stables.

14:14.480 --> 14:19.240
We think we should be courageous…
do something powerful

14:20.680 --> 14:23.200
to put an end to this unlawful behavior.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.160
Pino said,
"I won't let them win."

14:32.600 --> 14:36.000
He wouldn't let them get away with it.
He wouldn't even weigh the risks.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.360
Pino is great at rallying small troops.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.640
STABLES OF SHAME

14:49.400 --> 14:51.160
Every day that we came here,

14:51.760 --> 14:56.520
we stood with our backs
against the stable gates, and we said,

14:56.600 --> 15:01.920
"These stables must be destroyed
because they represent

15:02.000 --> 15:05.280
the Mafia's power in Partinico,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.880
an abuse of power here."

15:08.760 --> 15:12.160
DECEMBER 2007

15:15.520 --> 15:18.440
I was the first
to hit the stables with the bulldozer.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.120
They demolished the stables

15:26.720 --> 15:28.960
because Maniaci put pressure on them.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.400
Getting into a bulldozer
and tearing down Vitale's stables meant

15:37.480 --> 15:40.240
putting your life at risk,
and no one wanted to do it.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.040
He got into the bulldozer,

15:48.640 --> 15:52.000
and he hit the stables
with the TV cameras filming him.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.200
That's Pino Maniaci.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.720
TELEJATO NEWS

16:07.160 --> 16:11.000
Telejato's old car
was set on fire outside the TV station.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.240
The fire was started deliberately.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.160
This was an act of intimidation
aimed at Maniaci and Telejato.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.480
One of our cars was shot at.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.200
They shot the windows.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.600
We had a car set on fire,
the tires slashed.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.120
The son of the boss stopped me
while I was driving through Partinico

16:38.000 --> 16:41.560
and tried to kill me
by strangling me with my own tie.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.320
It's the price you pay
for being a certain kind of journalist.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.800
Sometimes,
I wake up in the night,

17:00.600 --> 17:02.280
and I think, "what's happening?"

17:04.120 --> 17:05.160
And I can't sleep.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.760
You know, I have…

17:12.960 --> 17:13.960
I worry about…

17:16.600 --> 17:18.280
…what will happen next.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.800
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

17:42.800 --> 17:49.120
We'll start the show with some bad news…
devastating… perhaps the worst news.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.560
Telejato's old dogs, Billy and Cherie,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.600
have been brutally killed
and hanged in their kennels.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.360
This is how the motherfuckers
left them for me to find.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.520
I can't even look.
Take it away. Away. Away! Away! Away!

18:22.880 --> 18:24.920
Our two newsroom dogs are no more,

18:25.440 --> 18:28.640
and the worst thing is
they paid… with their lives

18:28.720 --> 18:30.760
because of their… affection…

18:36.920 --> 18:39.680
Affection for Pino Maniaci
and the whole family.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.720
If there's something that this newsroom,
that Pino Maniaci does,

18:49.640 --> 18:52.080
has done, that you didn't want,

18:52.600 --> 18:53.840
or you don't like,

18:55.320 --> 18:57.840
you need to have the balls and the guts

18:57.920 --> 18:58.920
to confront me,

18:59.560 --> 19:00.680
shoot me, even,

19:02.360 --> 19:03.800
but not my animals.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.680
Did you have the balls? No.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.160
You took it out on two poor,
defenseless animals,

19:12.960 --> 19:14.560
who did nothing to you.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.600
Do you see how shitty you are?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.320
You are the scum of the Earth.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.840
THE DAY AFTER THE DOGS' DEATHS,
PRIME MINISTER MATTEO RENZI CALLED MANIACI

19:30.640 --> 19:32.560
Hello. It's Matteo Renzi.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.320
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-I want to send my condolences and…

19:36.400 --> 19:37.520
DECEMBER 2014

19:37.600 --> 19:41.600
Pino, the things you have been through
in the last few years, are awful,

19:42.560 --> 19:45.480
and the incident yesterday
was terribly sad.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.320
All I can do now is call you,

19:51.920 --> 19:55.360
then, the next time you are in Rome,
I'd like to meet you.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.440
It would be my pleasure to come
and meet you next time I'm in the area.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.120
My sincerest regards.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.360
-Thanks, Mr. President, very kind of you.
-You're welcome. Keep up the good work.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.520
Thank you. Thank you.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.760
MAFIA IN THE CAPITAL

20:17.280 --> 20:18.960
Something terrible has happened.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.120
Yesterday, you found your two dogs hanged.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.360
We wanted to have you here
to tell you that we're thinking of you.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.960
Thank you for your kindness…
and for having me here.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.760
Let me tell you, we're not going to stop.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.960
We're carrying on.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.920
We have the support of honest people.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.800
Pino, this applause is for you.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.680
From everyone here
in the studio, as always.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.600
Despite the threats, we carried on.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.600
I really started to enjoy the reaction.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.720
"Go on. We're with you."

21:08.360 --> 21:10.200
"We're all Pino Maniaci."

21:10.720 --> 21:12.920
"We're all Telejato."

21:21.440 --> 21:24.560
-Go Telejato!
-Go Telejato!

21:24.640 --> 21:26.640
Go Telejato!

21:29.200 --> 21:30.840
Maniaci is one of us!

21:51.920 --> 21:54.280
I am a wife,
a mother of three children.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.640
A normal person
who chose to be a judge in 1981.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.280
The Mafia war was going on in Sicily.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.680
Mimmo was my first bodyguard.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.120
He also taught me how to shoot.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.360
If I hadn't had a bodyguard,
I'd be dead for sure.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.120
Because one bullet
doesn't cost the Mafia anything.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.720
Congratulations.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.400
Even after all this time,
you didn't forget the technique at all.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.560
Well, I had a good teacher.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.200
I'm happy. Of course.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.800
All dead.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.280
-We didn't leave anyone injured.
-No one left injured.

22:50.760 --> 22:55.480
I became a judge
because I wanted to contribute to society,

22:55.560 --> 22:57.880
to make changes for the better.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.680
NOVEMBER 1993

23:02.760 --> 23:06.200
Totò Riina was a bloodthirsty,
ruthless boss.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.160
Riina's Mafia committed many massacres.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.440
Salvatore Riina,
62 years old, known as Totò,

23:16.960 --> 23:20.400
a living legend who inspired
Marlon Brando's role in The Godfather.

23:23.480 --> 23:27.720
His first public appearance was
at my trial, where I was the deputy judge.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.000
It was a face-to-face confrontation.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.240
You don't have to answer,

23:39.320 --> 23:42.840
but if something is funny,
share it with the court or stop laughing.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.360
No comment.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.760
You asked to confront your accusers.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.160
I did.
Now, I've read these things, Your Honor,

23:50.240 --> 23:52.480
and I no longer want to confront this man.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.840
When I got home,
my husband Lorenzo said,

23:58.920 --> 24:01.480
"You tell Riina off just like you do me."

24:04.200 --> 24:07.320
Because I'm a bit like that.
I say, "You mustn't do that."

24:08.440 --> 24:11.920
So I'm, let's say, bossy in a good way.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.920
And he says, "You talk to Riina as though
he can't do anything to you.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.800
You know what may happen? Why not
stay quiet? What difference can it make?"

24:20.880 --> 24:25.400
I say, "It makes a difference."
Because Riina has a life sentence.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.360
He won't get out,
but he wants to show people

24:28.440 --> 24:30.560
that he can still give orders from inside,

24:31.080 --> 24:32.520
and I can't let that happen.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.120
It can't happen, we are the State.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.240
Your Honor,
I also have the right to not answer.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.440
I don't want to answer. I…

24:42.280 --> 24:45.040
No, no one can force you to answer.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.080
Your Honor, it's useless making demands
because there's nothing you can demand.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.040
Some friends
made fun of me because…

24:52.120 --> 24:55.560
They said, "They see you as someone
who isn't scared of anything."

24:56.080 --> 25:00.240
I'm not scared of the Mafia,
but I'm scared of, I don't know, insects.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.800
So, actually they were joking,

25:02.880 --> 25:07.000
they said, "Instead of sending you TNT,
Riina should send you a box of butterflies

25:07.080 --> 25:08.840
because you'd be scared stiff."

25:20.680 --> 25:22.200
She did the right thing,

25:24.360 --> 25:26.880
even with all the consequences.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.040
At any point, you could receive news
you never want to hear.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.400
The most dangerous moments were
going in and out of the house.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.520
That's when my wife was most… um…

25:43.440 --> 25:44.480
vulnerable.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.720
And then

25:50.800 --> 25:52.000
we got more used to it.

25:53.400 --> 25:57.160
When the kids got older, they asked,
"Why do you still have to do this job?"

25:57.240 --> 25:59.520
Because it was mainly
the eldest who said it.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.120
He'd say "When? When will you stop?
When will you leave your job?"

26:03.920 --> 26:06.560
And I'd say,
"Francesco, if I leave, they'll win

26:06.640 --> 26:09.400
because that's what they want.
They want me to go away."

26:13.760 --> 26:15.600
The terrible quote from The Leopard,

26:15.680 --> 26:18.960
that "Everything changes
because nothing changes"

26:19.040 --> 26:20.480
is true in Sicily.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.320
Just because the names

26:25.080 --> 26:26.680
and the bosses change,

26:27.480 --> 26:29.240
doesn't mean the mentality changes.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.000
IN 2010 SILVANA SAGUTO BECAME PRESIDENT

26:34.080 --> 26:37.800
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES
AT THE COURT OF PALERMO

26:42.400 --> 26:45.440
Preventive measures
are one of the most effective tools

26:45.520 --> 26:47.600
in the fight against the Mafia.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.040
With strong evidence,

26:50.760 --> 26:52.520
even without a criminal trial,

26:53.760 --> 26:56.480
the Mafia's assets can be seized

26:56.560 --> 26:58.440
with preventive measures,

27:00.720 --> 27:03.120
and it's up to them to show

27:03.200 --> 27:07.120
that those assets
haven't come from illegal activity.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.280
So they are more fearful

27:12.800 --> 27:16.400
of the application of preventive measures
than they are of jail.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.040
THE PRESIDING JUDGE
SILVANA SAGUTO

27:20.600 --> 27:22.400
THE SEIZED GOODS ARE MANAGED

27:22.480 --> 27:25.600
BY THE DEPARTMENT
OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES OF THE COURT

27:25.680 --> 27:28.000
THE GOODS WILL ONLY BE RETURNED

27:28.080 --> 27:31.640
IF THE ACCUSED CAN PROVE
THEY WERE OBTAINED LEGALLY

27:34.120 --> 27:36.880
When I became
the president of the department,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.080
I finally had

27:39.600 --> 27:40.920
the power and the duty

27:41.000 --> 27:44.280
to do as much as possible
to increase preventive measures

27:44.800 --> 27:47.520
against organized crime run by the Mafia.

27:49.080 --> 27:52.680
I've seized assets worth billions.
Billions!

27:54.880 --> 27:57.520
A business empire,
worth over €600 million,

27:57.600 --> 27:58.960
was seized from the family…

27:59.040 --> 28:02.200
More than 7,600 houses,
1,000 businesses,

28:02.280 --> 28:04.040
almost half of these in Sicily…

28:04.120 --> 28:07.680
…a car dealership,
company shares, and a private TV company

28:07.760 --> 28:10.360
will be managed
by a court-appointed administrator.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.800
The work I did

28:15.960 --> 28:18.480
meant I couldn't avoid making enemies.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.120
The Telejato station mainly
takes care of fighting the Mafia.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.600
But once we started looking around,
we found corruption almost everywhere.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.320
We started to report

28:44.400 --> 28:47.120
those who were corrupt
in local administrations.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.200
With the many reports
that Telejato made against the Mafia,

28:55.320 --> 28:57.480
exposing the names of criminals,

29:00.360 --> 29:02.920
we became a focal point in our region.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.080
JANUARY 2013

29:07.160 --> 29:09.640
And a group of people
who worked for a company

29:09.720 --> 29:12.240
that had been seized, came to the station.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.680
The workers came to Telejato.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.680
They were crying as they told me
all the bullshit that was going on,

29:25.880 --> 29:29.600
about all the stealing that
this judicial administration was doing.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.600
Alarm bells started ringing,

29:32.640 --> 29:36.240
and of course, I went
to the Court of Palermo to find out more.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.160
We have big problems.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.720
Now, imagine if this law said,
"We take assets from the Mafia,

29:47.520 --> 29:50.400
they'll be managed
by judicial administrations

29:50.480 --> 29:53.160
who steal the money,
bankrupt the companies,

29:53.240 --> 29:55.960
and throw hundreds of workers
out into the street,

29:56.040 --> 29:57.520
who didn't do anything"?

29:59.280 --> 30:02.800
We're talking about
judicial administrations

30:04.800 --> 30:08.920
who have transcended the spirit
of the La Torre Law against the Mafia.

30:09.880 --> 30:14.320
OCTOBER 1979

30:14.400 --> 30:17.320
We propose that there should be a new law

30:17.400 --> 30:19.960
to give the police and the courts

30:20.040 --> 30:21.840
the necessary legal tools

30:21.920 --> 30:25.400
to be able to prosecute
alleged Mafia members.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.920
Pio La Torre was
a member of Parliament who realized

30:32.000 --> 30:35.080
that if you convict a mafioso
and don't touch their assets,

30:35.600 --> 30:37.480
the risk is acceptable to the Mafia.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.200
The law worked.
The Mafia lost a lot of money and power.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.120
And Pio La Torre paid the highest price.

30:48.200 --> 30:52.080
Hello. There's been
another tragic attack on a politician.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.560
Pio La Torre, along with his driver,

30:54.640 --> 30:58.160
was assassinated in Palermo.
He was the regional secretary

30:58.240 --> 30:59.640
and former member…

31:08.160 --> 31:11.440
COMMITTEE
WE ARE ALL TELEJATO

31:12.200 --> 31:14.200
Telejato was always
the reference point

31:14.280 --> 31:16.160
for when the public has an issue.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.040
There was a rumor
about badly managed assets,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.560
money that was disappearing.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.040
The administrations
would get hold of thriving companies,

31:29.120 --> 31:31.160
and after a year, they'd go bankrupt.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.800
So at this point,
Telejato turned their attention

31:34.880 --> 31:37.600
to victims of preventive measures.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.440
-Hello.
-Hello.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.000
-How's it going?
-Ah, good, good, good.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.520
And where's…

31:54.320 --> 31:55.320
Pino?

31:58.360 --> 32:00.200
Are you going to get up to say hi?

32:02.520 --> 32:04.720
Let the dogs sniff you,
see if they bite.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.360
No, they're good dogs.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.760
So, I'll get the cameras ready.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.320
Pietro Cavallotti

32:14.400 --> 32:16.160
has brought to light a problem

32:17.320 --> 32:20.040
that not only is affecting his family,
but others too.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.840
The seizure was ordered
by the preventive measures department

32:24.920 --> 32:28.400
of the Court of Palermo.
The president is Judge Saguto.

32:28.920 --> 32:33.920
Pino, our companies were founded in…
In 1979 by my grandfather.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.680
Then they arrested us under the suspicion
of being Mafia members, Pino,

32:38.760 --> 32:42.480
and my grandfather died
without seeing the end to this story.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.280
The Cavallotti family
built a company

32:48.360 --> 32:55.080
that supplies gas and pipelines…
to different regions.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.760
They were accused of being Mafia members

33:00.840 --> 33:03.360
working for the famous Binnu Provenzano.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.440
Twenty years ago, this accusation
caused the Cavallotti companies

33:10.960 --> 33:12.040
to be seized,

33:13.240 --> 33:16.880
and they are still in the hands
of the judicial administrations.

33:20.040 --> 33:24.080
But the craziest thing is
that the Cavallotti family

33:24.160 --> 33:26.400
were cleared of being in the Mafia,

33:27.320 --> 33:30.640
or being linked to the Mafia,
in four trials.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.680
But their assets
were completely destroyed,

33:34.760 --> 33:36.120
sold, or eaten up

33:36.200 --> 33:38.280
by Silvana Saguto and Co

33:39.240 --> 33:41.480
within the preventive measures department.

33:43.840 --> 33:49.200
THE CAVALLOTTI FAMILY HAS COMPANIES
IN THE GAS SECTOR WORTH MILLIONS OF EUROS

33:57.360 --> 33:59.720
What you see behind me
is the result of years

33:59.800 --> 34:02.760
of the judicial administration
managing our business.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.960
If you're suspected of being linked
to the Mafia, you have a trial.

34:10.040 --> 34:14.680
Run a business in Sicily a certain way,
and people think someone is behind it.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.600
This is the underlying reason.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.400
That's why there are
a lot of Mafia trials.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.000
It's not that we wanted
to pay the pizzo. We were forced to!

34:27.640 --> 34:30.360
If we didn't pay the pizzo,
we'd all have been killed.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.480
And then they call you a mafioso!

34:35.000 --> 34:36.760
I have so much anger inside of me.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.200
This injustice is not fair!

34:40.720 --> 34:46.040
FEBRUARY 2014

34:46.120 --> 34:50.640
Today we want to talk directly
with the president of preventive measures,

34:52.880 --> 34:54.240
Judge Silvana Saguto.

34:56.720 --> 35:01.240
We want to talk about,
and show you, the seized assets

35:01.320 --> 35:03.240
left completely abandoned.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.960
This is what
you're doing to the community.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.080
COURT OF LAW

35:17.160 --> 35:18.880
There are some judges

35:18.960 --> 35:21.080
who love the smell of money.

35:21.840 --> 35:28.120
So much so, that they use
the seized or confiscated assets…

35:30.120 --> 35:31.560
…for personal gain,

35:32.240 --> 35:34.840
or to use them to recruit the support

35:35.840 --> 35:40.640
of family members,
daughters-in-law, children, godparents,

35:40.720 --> 35:43.640
children of court clerks and anyone else.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.760
We've called you "thieves."

35:46.840 --> 35:48.000
FEBRUARY 2015

35:48.080 --> 35:52.880
We've called you "vultures."
We've called you "criminals."

35:56.440 --> 36:00.120
Telejato was becoming uncomfortable.
People wanted to silence us,

36:00.640 --> 36:03.000
and it wasn't just the Mafia
and the criminals,

36:04.600 --> 36:07.760
but also some people in the government,
that we attacked,

36:07.840 --> 36:12.280
wanted to silence us as well
because we discovered their corruption.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.880
Pino Maniaci requested
an interview with me,

36:23.760 --> 36:27.120
and I asked my colleagues,
"Who is this Maniaci?"

36:27.720 --> 36:28.960
I'd never heard of him.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.280
They said,
"He's some weirdo from Partinico,

36:34.400 --> 36:35.840
not even a real journalist."

36:38.880 --> 36:41.600
We were face to face
with Judge Saguto

36:42.280 --> 36:43.680
for about half an hour.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.360
I got the impression,

36:48.080 --> 36:50.320
from the questions that she asked,

36:52.200 --> 36:53.840
that she wanted to find out

36:55.040 --> 36:57.520
how much of the truth I knew.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.400
Absolute lies.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.800
Pino Maniaci's never been to my office.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.640
I said, "Look, I'm not interested
in an interview."

37:13.280 --> 37:16.200
I didn't consider it at all.
No one takes him seriously.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.560
No one watches Telejato.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.560
Judge Saguto
didn't even consider me

37:25.640 --> 37:28.760
because she thought
Telejato was just a local channel.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.240
But when the story broke
at a national level…

37:35.840 --> 37:37.240
Shit…

37:38.560 --> 37:40.480
That's when things got dangerous.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.840
SEPTEMBER 2015

37:48.520 --> 37:51.360
A storm hit
the preventive measures department

37:51.440 --> 37:55.680
of the Court of Palermo, in charge
of seizing assets from the Mafia.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.360
An ugly story
which may have consequences

37:59.440 --> 38:02.440
is shaking up a key department
in the fight against the Mafia.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.240
Heavy accusations
cast a shadow over the management

38:06.320 --> 38:09.240
of assets seized from the Mafia in Sicily.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.880
The president
of the preventive measures department,

38:12.960 --> 38:14.840
which manages Mafia assets,

38:14.920 --> 38:19.400
is being investigated for corruption,
misconduct and abuse of power.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.760
I was in Milan.
It was September 9th,

38:29.840 --> 38:31.600
an unforgettable day for me.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.760
In Palermo, only my children were at home.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.800
They called, and I found out from them

38:39.880 --> 38:43.120
that the finance police were there
and had a search warrant

38:43.200 --> 38:44.360
for our house.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.920
I didn't understand.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.000
But why? What were they looking for?
What might they find?

38:53.960 --> 38:56.360
What are they looking for at our house?

38:59.720 --> 39:01.880
They also searched my parents' house.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.120
My parents are 92 and 90.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.800
It was early in the morning.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.920
From over there, five people,
dressed in black, came into our house.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.400
We didn't know who they were,

39:18.240 --> 39:21.040
and then they said
they were the finance police.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.720
They had a search warrant,
and they looked everywhere.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.480
As soon as they came in,

39:30.000 --> 39:31.840
I said, "My daughter is a judge."

39:33.800 --> 39:35.920
Because I thought,
"What could they want from me?"

39:38.440 --> 39:41.120
I felt protected by the fact
my daughter was a judge.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.640
Here. All this furniture,
they lifted it up.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.320
They looked everywhere,
even behind the pictures on the wall.

39:53.360 --> 39:56.480
I said, "They don't have
the courage to wait for me."

39:58.760 --> 39:59.680
I was…

40:01.280 --> 40:05.040
furious more than scared. Furious.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.280
Clearly, we ruined
Judge Saguto's money-making scheme.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.440
JUSTICE

40:13.520 --> 40:16.960
She must have hated
Pino Maniaci and Telejato.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.120
What I didn't expect

40:21.640 --> 40:25.560
was that some of her colleagues
wanted to avenge her.

40:28.720 --> 40:34.840
MAY 2016

40:36.520 --> 40:38.880
Pino and I
were at the TV station.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.160
It was around 2:15 in the morning.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.000
We heard the bell ring,

40:49.080 --> 40:52.240
and the person on the intercom said
it was the police.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.160
A helicopter was flying above us.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.200
I said, "Wait. What's happening?"

41:02.960 --> 41:04.000
We opened the door,

41:05.520 --> 41:09.160
and the chief said to Pino,
"You need to come to the police station."

41:09.880 --> 41:10.720
"Why?"

41:12.760 --> 41:14.960
They said,
"We'll tell you at the station."

41:20.440 --> 41:22.400
I was scared when I realized

41:23.800 --> 41:25.120
what was happening.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.360
In a new low blow
to the Mafia,

41:30.440 --> 41:35.240
ten alleged Mafia members of the Partinico
and Borgetto clans have been arrested.
