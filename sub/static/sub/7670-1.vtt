01:39.434 --> 01:41.862
Waiting for your reply.

01:44.481 --> 01:47.500
Waiting for your reply!

01:52.405 --> 01:55.039
I cannot do anything.

01:56.409 --> 01:59.870
Your father is already
in American hands.

01:59.871 --> 02:03.415
We are watching the airport.
His plane has not taken off.

02:03.416 --> 02:06.085
You are watching the wrong plane.

02:06.086 --> 02:09.300
Your father was taken from
a military base this morning.

02:09.756 --> 02:12.392
You are lying.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.600
We must act.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.148
Let's go!

02:38.451 --> 02:42.220
Luis.

02:43.081 --> 02:46.926
"We interrupt our coverage
to bring you this report..."

02:47.460 --> 02:51.931
"...live via satellite
from the United States..."

02:52.966 --> 02:56.853
"...as extradited
narcotics trafficker..."

02:57.470 --> 03:03.609
"...Enrique Cali arrives at Homestead
Air Force Base near Miami, Florida..."

03:03.768 --> 03:08.480
"even as the gunmen here at the Palace of
Justice continue to demand his release."

03:08.481 --> 03:10.482
Very well.

03:13.987 --> 03:15.800
We have to go, Judge!

03:17.615 --> 03:19.491
Move forward!

03:19.492 --> 03:21.226
Hurry up!

05:08.100 --> 05:10.502
Hey, bring that back here!

05:26.718 --> 05:29.821
Hey, Frank! Frank, over here!

05:44.537 --> 05:47.238
Frank, over here!

05:47.239 --> 05:49.240
- Looking for this, Frank?
- Very funny.

05:49.241 --> 05:52.210
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:52.211 --> 05:55.112
The Dean's waiting for you
guys back in your room.

05:55.113 --> 05:57.682
A pleasure knowing you.

06:07.293 --> 06:10.795
These two gentlemen are deputy
United States marshals.

06:10.796 --> 06:13.698
They wish to have a word
with you, Mr. Donoghue.

06:13.699 --> 06:16.133
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.134 --> 06:19.136
Let us have the room.

06:20.906 --> 06:23.875
Close the door behind you.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.251
It's, uh, just a
precaution we're taking...

06:33.252 --> 06:36.287
With everyone involved in
the Enrique Cali case.

06:36.288 --> 06:39.924
Especially with your father since
he's presiding in the case.

06:39.925 --> 06:43.361
My father's been a federal judge
since I was five years old.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.397
What's he saying?

06:46.398 --> 06:49.934
You saw what happened...
they're talking about Phil's dad.

06:49.935 --> 06:52.803
- He's a judge, right?
- Yeah.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.805
It was on all three networks.

06:54.806 --> 06:58.175
The boys are not allowed
TVs in their rooms.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.445
Luis Cali, his son,

07:00.446 --> 07:03.180
is, uh, passionately
devoted to his father.

07:03.181 --> 07:07.184
Took over the palace of justice down
there trying to get his father back.

07:07.185 --> 07:09.854
The judge and two
others were killed.

07:09.855 --> 07:12.357
- Is he in trouble?
- No.

07:12.358 --> 07:16.227
- Something about Colombia.
- Good coffee.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.796
Now, you know why they have
to take these precautions.

07:18.797 --> 07:21.799
Your whole family will be
put in a very safe place.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.402
They're taking him out today.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.004
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

07:27.005 --> 07:29.039
Where?

07:29.040 --> 07:33.477
We can't tell you that, son, but it
will be a secure military installation.

07:36.248 --> 07:40.884
You gentlemen may as well come
in, help your roommate pack.

07:44.723 --> 07:45.402
See you soon.

07:45.403 --> 07:46.991
Good luck. We look forward
to having you back.

07:46.992 --> 07:49.994
- Thanks, sir. You too.
- All right.

07:55.334 --> 07:58.202
- Billy.
- See you later, Phil. Rock 'n' roll.

07:58.203 --> 08:00.938
Were you off campus yesterday?

08:00.939 --> 08:03.333
I'm on probation, sir. I'm
not allowed off campus.

08:03.334 --> 08:04.609
That's right. I forgot.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.112
You know, somebody spray painted
the Sheriff's car yesterday.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.881
- Wrote the word "rejects" all over it.
- No kidding.

08:10.882 --> 08:13.384
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

08:13.385 --> 08:15.886
All right, you got away
with it this time.

08:15.887 --> 08:20.024
Just remember, I'm always
gonna be watching you.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.909
Lights out, boys.

08:38.909 --> 08:42.078
Eat shit, Mr. Peterson!

08:45.384 --> 08:48.586
There go the Dean
and the Headmaster.

08:51.590 --> 08:54.091
I can't go, man. This
paper's due in the morning.

08:54.092 --> 08:57.662
Come on. They're ready.
Let's go, let's go.

08:58.930 --> 09:01.399
Come on! Let's go.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.602
Billy, this is your homework.

09:04.603 --> 09:07.905
That's good. That's good.
Come on. Let's go.

09:16.147 --> 09:18.549
Take it easy, man. You're
gonna break the window.

09:18.550 --> 09:21.018
Am not.

09:35.401 --> 09:37.402
Shut up, Snuffy!

09:37.403 --> 09:39.636
Blow me.

09:42.608 --> 09:44.609
Watch your head, man.

09:44.610 --> 09:47.645
That's like a spinal injury, man.

09:47.646 --> 09:50.615
Quiet.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.917
I know you're mad, brother.

09:52.918 --> 09:55.085
Nice hole, Billy.

09:55.086 --> 09:57.922
Speaking of holes, anyone
have a sister? Call her up.

09:57.923 --> 09:59.924
- I saw Joey's mom at the mall.
- Saw his mom?

10:04.162 --> 10:07.164
You guys better leave
my mom out of this.

10:07.165 --> 10:10.935
I love my mom. And you
can, too, for 12 bucks.

10:10.936 --> 10:14.171
As long as you're not talking about
my mother, everybody's cool.

10:14.172 --> 10:16.441
Make yourselves comfortable.
The bar is open.

10:16.442 --> 10:18.876
- Mr. Trotta, why don't you tend the bar?
- Mouthwash?

10:18.877 --> 10:21.679
Yes, mouthwash. Or maybe not.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.015
What's the deal, Billy? You trying
to tell me my breath stinks?

10:25.016 --> 10:27.952
I wasn't saying your breath stinks. Why
do you take everything so personally?

10:27.953 --> 10:30.187
Damn, Hank.

10:31.523 --> 10:35.059
I don't think smoking when you
have asthma is such a good idea.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.895
- Smoking isn't such a good idea, period.
- Gentlemen.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.699
- Here's to Mr. Donoghue.
- Yes, to Phil.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.535
- May he get laid while on the outside.
- Amen.

10:44.536 --> 10:47.538
- This better not be mouthwash.
- Trust me.

10:49.675 --> 10:53.610
"Trust me." Asshole.
This is mouthwash.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.715
No, it's not.

10:54.716 --> 10:56.647
Tastes like mouthwash.
What the hell is it?

10:56.648 --> 10:58.883
Four parts 100 proof vodka,

10:58.884 --> 11:01.853
two parts peppermint schnapps
for that mouthwash flavor...

11:01.854 --> 11:03.855
And one part crÃ¨me de
menthe to make it green.

11:03.856 --> 11:05.857
You're a sick man.
I hope you know that.

11:05.858 --> 11:09.494
That's the beauty of this concept. It looks
and smells and tastes just like mouthwash.

11:09.495 --> 11:12.396
We can keep liquor in plain
sight in our dorm rooms, right?

11:12.397 --> 11:15.432
The best part, I sold 8 bottles of
this stuff for 35 bucks apiece.

11:15.433 --> 11:18.102
- We are rich.
- Ooh, brother, you is a genius.

11:18.103 --> 11:19.022
A lunatic, but a genius.

11:19.023 --> 11:21.271
Mix me up another shot. I'll
work on the entertainment.

11:21.272 --> 11:24.876
Man, this stuff is great. It's opening
up my lungs, making me breathe easier.

11:24.877 --> 11:27.092
Evidently, it's making
you fart easier too.

11:27.093 --> 11:28.012
I didn't fart.

11:28.013 --> 11:32.216
The first rule of prep school etiquette:
In a basement with no windows, don't fart.

11:32.217 --> 11:36.420
No, the first rule is to pretend you're
asleep when your roommate's beating off.

11:36.421 --> 11:41.125
The first rule is to wait until your
roommate falls asleep before beating off.

11:41.126 --> 11:43.928
Was that a personal remark
directed at me, roommate?

11:43.929 --> 11:46.430
- You choke your chicken. It's yours.
- You slap your monkey.

11:46.431 --> 11:48.599
I can't sleep at night.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.868
Speaking of beating off.

11:50.869 --> 11:53.604
I'll do the talking.

11:53.605 --> 11:56.006
Hello?

11:57.475 --> 12:00.277
This is Jennifer. What's your name?

12:00.278 --> 12:02.279
Steve.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.150
Well, hello, Steve. Mmm.

12:06.151 --> 12:09.987
Oh, I like that name. Tell
me what you look like.

12:10.923 --> 12:13.190
Um... well,

12:13.191 --> 12:15.593
I got blond hair...

12:15.594 --> 12:18.696
And, um, I wear an
earring in my left ear.

12:18.697 --> 12:23.467
About five-nine, 150 pounds.

12:23.468 --> 12:26.604
Did I mention I'm black?

12:26.605 --> 12:28.806
Sounds very sexy, Steve.

12:28.807 --> 12:31.809
Oh, I like long, blond
hair on a black man.

12:31.810 --> 12:35.279
Oh, I also got long, blonde hair.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.816
I'm not black, but I'm
very, very tanned.

12:38.817 --> 12:43.487
I'm wearing black lace bra and panties
that look really hot against my skin.

12:43.488 --> 12:47.458
Oh! Would you like me
to take my bra off?

12:47.459 --> 12:49.794
Yes.

12:49.795 --> 12:52.229
Yes, please.

13:06.177 --> 13:08.746
Oh, my nipples are dark red.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.515
Oh, very big, very hard.

13:11.516 --> 13:15.086
Oh! Oh! I'm rubbing my breasts.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.222
Oh, it feels so good.

13:18.223 --> 13:22.426
Steve, I'm running my hands
down over my body now.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.996
Oh! Oh!

13:24.997 --> 13:29.366
- Slipping my thumbs inside my panties.
- Slip 'em in. Slip 'em in.

13:29.367 --> 13:33.704
I'm completely naked except for
black stockings and high heels.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.741
Would you like me to leave
them on or take them off?

13:36.742 --> 13:38.743
Take them off. Now.

13:38.744 --> 13:42.246
On. On. On. Leave them on.

13:42.247 --> 13:46.017
Why don't you go ahead
and leave them on?

13:46.018 --> 13:48.953
Steve, oh, you're so wicked.

13:48.954 --> 13:53.257
- I like it. Oh. Ooh. Oh.
- She likes it. She likes it.

13:53.258 --> 13:56.560
It's so soft, so big.

13:56.561 --> 13:58.696
Oh, I just wanna touch it.

13:58.697 --> 14:01.866
You want me to touch
it, don't you, Steve?

14:01.867 --> 14:05.202
Yes. By all means, touch it.

14:05.203 --> 14:07.872
- Oh, Steve. Oh, my God!
- Touch it, baby, touch it.

14:07.873 --> 14:10.074
- Outstanding!
- Oh, Steve.

14:10.075 --> 14:13.310
Oh! Oh! Oh!

14:13.311 --> 14:15.779
Hide it. Everybody move.

14:29.761 --> 14:32.596
Mr. Tepper.

14:32.597 --> 14:35.665
Why am I not surprised?

14:36.768 --> 14:39.937
This is ingenious.

14:39.938 --> 14:42.773
Thanks.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.209
What's this?

14:45.210 --> 14:48.545
- Mouthwash?
- Oh, come on, Mr. Tepper.

14:48.546 --> 14:52.783
You expect me to believe you crawled down
to the basement just to drink mouthwash?

14:52.784 --> 14:54.785
I'm trying to fight plaque.

14:54.786 --> 14:57.687
Gingivitis. Tartar buildup.
I got a little...

14:58.456 --> 15:01.792
- Are you alone down here?
- Yes, sir.

15:01.793 --> 15:04.494
- Where's your roommate?
- Up in his room, I guess.

15:04.495 --> 15:07.164
Shit.

15:07.165 --> 15:09.133
Watch your mouth.

15:09.134 --> 15:11.902
Come on out, Mr. Bradberry.

15:18.309 --> 15:21.978
You too, Mr. Trotta.
May as well come out.

15:24.315 --> 15:26.783
He was bluffing.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.887
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.957
Mr. Giles and Mr.
Montoya, come out now.

15:32.958 --> 15:37.794
Or I'll place a guard on this basement,
have a bed check of the entire school.

15:43.668 --> 15:46.937
Gentlemen, I want you
all in my office...

15:46.938 --> 15:49.907
At 9:00 A.M. Sharp
tomorrow morning.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.777
Go to your rooms now. Move!

15:52.778 --> 15:55.011
Not you, Billy.

16:00.952 --> 16:03.353
This...

16:03.354 --> 16:05.722
you know, this is really,
really ingenious.

16:05.723 --> 16:09.827
No, noth...
just, uh, put the little...

16:09.828 --> 16:13.330
- Where'd you get this stuff?
- Radio shack.

16:13.331 --> 16:15.732
Really? Was it expensive?

16:15.733 --> 16:18.602
No, no, I picked it up on sale.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.138
On sale. Good. Here.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.608
- Break it.
- What?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.244
Throw it on the floor. Smash it.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.516
Use your foot.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.586
Come on, come on. Use your foot.
Make believe it's my foot.

16:36.587 --> 16:38.922
Smash it.

16:43.829 --> 16:46.062
That's enough.

16:49.201 --> 16:51.435
Let's go.

17:26.238 --> 17:28.438
This is the U.S. Border Patrol!

18:20.992 --> 18:23.994
You think you're the first kid to
put liquor in mouthwash bottles?

18:23.995 --> 18:25.996
It was done in my day.

18:25.997 --> 18:29.799
I might have even done it myself.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.875
Mr. Kouf, Mr. Greenwalt.

18:40.711 --> 18:45.582
Mr. Tepper here sold you a bottle
of mouthwash with vodka in it?

18:45.583 --> 18:49.319
You will not be punished if you
give it to me in five seconds.

18:54.826 --> 18:57.561
Good. Good night.

19:04.702 --> 19:06.979
- Who's next?
- If you're gonna kick me out,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.840
kick me out. Don't make me look
like a narc to my friends.

19:09.841 --> 19:13.877
If we expelled you, that'd make
four prep schools in four years.

19:13.878 --> 19:16.194
You trying for the
guinness book of records?

19:16.195 --> 19:17.772
No, sir.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.118
Should we try this one?

19:25.290 --> 19:27.291
How 'bout this one?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.926
This one? Ah.

19:29.927 --> 19:31.928
Yes.

19:34.565 --> 19:37.034
Mr. Burg, Mr. Zarpas.

19:37.035 --> 19:39.903
Billy Tepper sold you
a bottle of vodka.

19:39.904 --> 19:42.906
You have until the count of
three to hand it out here.

19:42.907 --> 19:46.243
One, two...

19:46.244 --> 19:48.278
Good. Good night.

19:48.279 --> 19:50.634
- Now, where to next?
- You made your point.

19:50.635 --> 19:54.318
I can't fake you out. Fine. I admit it.
Don't put me through this anymore.

19:54.319 --> 19:58.455
I'm sorry, but I will not have
alcohol in my dormitories.

19:58.456 --> 20:01.625
Then I'll get it.
I'll bring it to you.

20:01.626 --> 20:03.627
- How many more are there?
- Eight.

20:03.628 --> 20:06.129
- You better not lie to me.
- Eight.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.602
I believe you. I'll
be in my apartment.

20:12.603 --> 20:15.339
You have ten minutes.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.431
Do you think we should expel you?

20:40.432 --> 20:44.334
Do whatever you want. I'm not about
to beg to stay in this school.

20:44.335 --> 20:49.473
If we threw you out, who would you
live with? Your mother or your father?

20:49.474 --> 20:52.976
I don't exactly have a burning desire
to live with either one of them.

20:52.977 --> 20:56.680
Then what's behind this perverse desire to
constantly risk getting thrown out of school?

20:56.681 --> 20:58.682
You think I set out to get caught?

20:58.683 --> 21:00.951
I don't think you do
it purely for fun.

21:00.952 --> 21:03.720
I was having loads of fun
until you came along.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.656
Should I pack or what?
Shut up and sit down.

21:06.657 --> 21:10.626
Stop acting like such a tough
guy. It doesn't impress me.

21:20.871 --> 21:23.006
I'm not going to expel you.

21:23.007 --> 21:28.011
Three schools have done that and it's
obviously done nothing for your character.

21:28.012 --> 21:31.381
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, sir.

21:31.382 --> 21:34.618
I'm gonna do much worse.

21:34.619 --> 21:38.622
I am going to keep you
here until you graduate.

21:38.623 --> 21:41.225
It will probably take
years at this rate.

21:41.226 --> 21:43.827
I might wear you out before then.

21:44.629 --> 21:48.798
Don't you worry about
wearing me out.

21:48.799 --> 21:51.267
I'm gonna wear you out.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.478
Well?

22:01.479 --> 22:04.781
He wanted to know why I
have such a bad attitude.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.751
Did he kick you out?

22:07.752 --> 22:09.753
No.

22:09.754 --> 22:12.756
He put me on pots and pans
for the rest of the semester.

22:12.757 --> 22:14.991
Could be worse.

22:14.992 --> 22:18.094
Yeah, he could have smashed my
kneecaps with a ball-peen hammer.

22:18.095 --> 22:20.564
God, that fucker. That asshole!

22:20.565 --> 22:23.933
Get up. Get up!
We gotta strike back.

22:23.934 --> 22:26.436
We have to do something
epic tonight...

22:26.437 --> 22:29.706
Or else I'm gonna look like a douche
bag to the entire school. Come on.

22:29.707 --> 22:32.633
You were born looking
like a douche bag, Billy.

22:35.780 --> 22:38.615
Come on, Joey. Get dressed!

22:38.616 --> 22:42.052
I don't want to, man. I want to go
to sleep, dream about Jennifer.

22:42.053 --> 22:44.354
Later.

22:44.355 --> 22:47.557
It was fucking humiliating, man.

22:49.093 --> 22:51.094
Okay.

22:51.095 --> 22:53.096
See, they're up for it.

22:53.097 --> 22:56.433
- You know me, man. I'm always up for it.
- Good.

22:56.434 --> 22:59.236
What am I up for tonight?

22:59.237 --> 23:02.138
I don't know. I'm
thinking about it.

23:02.139 --> 23:05.108
- Fire hoses.
- That's been done.

23:05.109 --> 23:07.977
Cherry bombs in the toilets.

23:07.978 --> 23:12.249
It's too destructive. That would let
the Dean know he got under our skin.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.585
No, it's gotta be cooler than that.

23:14.586 --> 23:18.054
It's gotta be something
witty, something elegant.

23:18.989 --> 23:21.592
Why don't you think about
it while I take a nap?

23:21.593 --> 23:23.927
I got it. I got it. Come on.

23:23.928 --> 23:26.162
You'll love this.

23:35.473 --> 23:38.542
Come in.

23:39.744 --> 23:43.046
Sir, Dr. Gould would like to see
you right away in the quad.

23:52.457 --> 23:56.359
Check it out. It's the
Headmaster's furniture.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.171
Try not to laugh.

24:08.172 --> 24:10.406
I'm trying.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.377
I mean, just look at this.

24:13.378 --> 24:16.713
The blotter, the pen,
the teacup on my desk.

24:18.048 --> 24:21.150
Everything just as
I left it last night.

24:23.321 --> 24:26.089
You know what I'd
really like to do?

24:26.090 --> 24:29.760
That's to work out here all day.

24:29.761 --> 24:33.096
I don't suppose that would be too
good for discipline, would it?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.665
- I'm afraid not.
- Yes.

24:36.601 --> 24:40.337
- Any idea who did it?
- Very good idea.

24:40.338 --> 24:42.339
Don't be too hard on them.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.343
It's much better than fire hoses in the
chapel or cherry bombs in the toilet.

24:55.687 --> 24:58.888
- You!
- Yo, Billy!

24:58.889 --> 25:01.024
And you.

25:01.025 --> 25:03.259
And you two.

25:11.703 --> 25:15.572
You gentlemen have the honor
of returning this furniture...

25:15.573 --> 25:18.942
Back to its original place.

25:20.077 --> 25:22.646
Pick up that banana.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.749
Whoa!

25:31.288 --> 25:33.990
Are there any objections?

25:33.991 --> 25:36.492
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

25:38.262 --> 25:40.496
Yeah, sounds cool.

26:18.403 --> 26:22.706
- Hey, taste test.
- Well?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.503
- Hi. Can I help you?
- How you doin'?

26:37.504 --> 26:40.440
We don't want to hurt anybody.
Get in the truck.

27:10.971 --> 27:13.406
Get down!

27:30.157 --> 27:34.360
Stay on the floor where you
are until we tell you to move.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.396
Don't get up. Don't do anything.

27:37.397 --> 27:39.832
Is that clear?

27:43.403 --> 27:48.841
Hey! Stop! No! Don't hurt him!

29:16.864 --> 29:19.365
They're looking for Donoghue.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.935
You can threaten me
as much as you like.

29:21.936 --> 29:26.840
The fact remains that officers from the
United States Marshal's Service...

29:26.841 --> 29:29.209
Took young Donoghue out
of school yesterday,

29:29.210 --> 29:32.712
and they did not say where
they were taking him.

29:32.713 --> 29:35.715
I have been under a
lot of strain lately,

29:35.716 --> 29:38.117
and I don't have a lot of patience.

29:38.118 --> 29:42.222
If you're lying and he's
here, I will find him.

29:42.223 --> 29:44.457
I'll kill you.

29:45.893 --> 29:48.127
He's not here.

30:01.408 --> 30:05.144
According to this, you're
telling the truth.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.914
If you continue to do that, you
have nothing to fear from me.

30:07.915 --> 30:11.251
These young men have
done nothing to you.

30:11.252 --> 30:13.486
I realize that.

30:21.262 --> 30:24.998
How could this happen? We pay a
fortune for this kind of information!

30:24.999 --> 30:28.967
We were in transit. They couldn't get
to us. But we might not have a problem.

30:29.904 --> 30:32.338
I think you better
take a look at these.

30:32.339 --> 30:35.974
Anderson, Robert.

30:37.611 --> 30:40.913
- Anderson, Robert!
- Here.

30:45.085 --> 30:48.307
Your father is president
of the Tex-peet oil company.

30:48.308 --> 30:49.614
Yes, sir.

30:53.027 --> 30:56.028
Bradberry, Jonathan.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.206
Your father is Stephen Bradberry?

31:08.409 --> 31:11.556
Chairman of the first
empire bank of New York?

31:11.557 --> 31:13.036
Yes.

31:14.415 --> 31:17.349
And vice chairman of
the republican party?

31:19.053 --> 31:21.287
Yes.

31:25.426 --> 31:29.462
- Giles, Henry the Third.
- Yes.

31:29.863 --> 31:32.064
Come here, Giles.

31:38.672 --> 31:42.033
Your father is representative
Henry Giles Jr.?

31:42.034 --> 31:42.942
Yes.

31:43.243 --> 31:45.411
Chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.

31:45.412 --> 31:47.913
Yes, sir.

31:47.914 --> 31:50.149
Trotta, Joseph.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.529
Your father is Albert
Trotta of New York City.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.099
Yes.

32:06.100 --> 32:08.734
The Albert Trotta?

32:10.937 --> 32:14.873
What's the matter?
Not proud of your father.

32:16.843 --> 32:19.712
No.

32:19.713 --> 32:22.981
- Montoya, Ricardo.
- Yes, sir.

32:30.424 --> 32:34.627
Your father is senior partner
at Johnson, Montoya and Epps?

32:34.628 --> 32:36.629
Yes, sir.

32:36.630 --> 32:39.198
And past president of the
California bar association.

32:39.199 --> 32:41.267
Yes, sir.

32:41.268 --> 32:44.070
So tell me, Ricardo.
Are you a Mexican?

32:44.071 --> 32:46.305
Mexican-American.

32:47.341 --> 32:50.343
Do you speak Spanish?

32:50.344 --> 32:52.712
No, not really.

32:56.483 --> 32:58.918
- Put a bullet in him.
- No, wait!

32:58.919 --> 33:02.522
"Wait" what? You
don't speak Spanish.

33:02.523 --> 33:06.559
I'm sorry. I do speak
a little Spanish.

33:15.269 --> 33:18.537
Hey, don't! Hey, don't do that!

33:23.677 --> 33:25.911
Come on, man.

33:29.183 --> 33:31.750
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes, he is.

33:31.751 --> 33:35.921
Tell your friend he's
lucky I didn't shoot him.

33:35.922 --> 33:37.923
What's your name?

33:37.924 --> 33:40.659
- William Tepper.
- William Tepper.

33:40.660 --> 33:43.429
What does your father do, William?

33:43.430 --> 33:45.664
He's a contractor.

33:53.173 --> 33:56.709
According to this, he owns the third
largest construction company in the world.

33:56.710 --> 33:59.879
Yeah, he's a contractor.

34:01.448 --> 34:04.850
You're not afraid? Hmm?

34:04.851 --> 34:07.686
- Yes, I'm afraid.
- Good.

34:09.356 --> 34:11.724
Don't fuck with me.

34:22.536 --> 34:26.139
You're right, Jack. We
don't need Donoghue.

34:26.139 --> 34:28.806
We can play with this.

34:28.808 --> 34:33.246
I want the slick little bastard
that spray painted my car!

34:33.246 --> 34:37.416
Otherwise, I'm gonna start arresting
any of them damn rejects...

34:37.417 --> 34:39.818
That even show their
face in this town!

34:39.819 --> 34:43.054
- I don't think so. Take a look at this.
- Mouthwash.

34:43.056 --> 34:45.324
No. It's vodka.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.592
- One-hundred proof vodka.
- So?

34:47.594 --> 34:50.263
So you got an Uncle that owns that
liquor store down the street.

34:50.264 --> 34:53.098
- Wait just a damn minute.
- You wait just a damn minute, Sheriff.

34:53.099 --> 34:55.601
We're gonna make ourselves
a little deal here.

34:55.601 --> 34:58.437
You're gonna forget about who spray
painted your car, and I'm gonna forget...

34:58.438 --> 35:02.007
Sheriff! Somebody's been
shot at the Regis school!

35:02.008 --> 35:05.545
Come on, Dean.

35:30.304 --> 35:32.538
It's Frank Ingram.

35:33.907 --> 35:36.842
- What's going on up at the school?
- We don't know.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.812
We get fired on if we try
to get past the gate.

35:42.916 --> 35:47.420
You two, you get your shotguns, get in the
back seat of my car and stay out of sight.

35:47.421 --> 35:51.090
You don't want to do that. You want
to call the state police or the F.B.I.

35:51.091 --> 35:53.759
Don't tell me what to do.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.995
I'll call them myself.

35:59.566 --> 36:01.867
Now hear this up at the school.

36:01.868 --> 36:06.105
This is the King's County Sheriff.

36:06.106 --> 36:08.608
Hold your fire.

36:08.609 --> 36:12.444
I'm coming up to talk to you.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.785
I'm alone and unarmed.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.787
Hold your fire.

36:21.788 --> 36:22.680
Hold your fire.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.400
Shoot at the engine. Prevent
them from coming closer.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.456
Prepare the antitank.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.669
Fire!

37:18.044 --> 37:21.213
Sheriff, Deputy Assistant
Director Otis Brown.

37:21.214 --> 37:22.078
How you doin'?

37:22.079 --> 37:24.317
Sheriff has agreed to our
assuming jurisdiction.

37:24.318 --> 37:27.553
I've been briefed on the plane.
What's your assessment?

37:27.554 --> 37:29.850
Sir, there's an unknown
number of terrorists...

37:29.851 --> 37:33.759
with .50-caliber machine
guns and antitank rockets.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.129
There's about three miles of
perimeter around the campus...

37:37.130 --> 37:40.232
And their weapons can
sweep the whole area.

37:40.233 --> 37:43.068
We've got to get assistance
from the military.

37:43.069 --> 37:45.137
I'll try to get it.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.594
No communication from
the school at all?

37:47.620 --> 37:48.708
None.

38:08.628 --> 38:11.196
Your father's well?

38:11.197 --> 38:15.768
He's tired of being in prison.
He's ready to go home.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.846
I'm glad you could get
here so quickly, Ed.

38:29.847 --> 38:31.149
My pleasure, Otis.

38:31.150 --> 38:35.755
I have troops taking up observation positions
around the perimeter of the school...

38:35.756 --> 38:39.892
And an assault force at a
staging area five minutes away.

38:39.893 --> 38:43.829
Now, my orders are to assist you
with observation and surveillance...

38:43.830 --> 38:46.565
And plan a joint assault
with your people.

38:46.566 --> 38:48.567
That's it, Otis.

38:48.568 --> 38:51.570
Anything else would require
specific orders from the president.

38:51.571 --> 38:56.008
I understand. Let's hope
we never need to ask.

38:58.512 --> 39:00.746
Is it armed?

39:02.416 --> 39:05.217
It is now.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.086
Oh, man!

39:08.087 --> 39:12.124
This is disgusting. They expect us
to eat this? This is dog vomit.

39:16.963 --> 39:21.100
The school gets taken over by terrorists,
and I'm still on pots and pans.

39:25.872 --> 39:30.208
Stop now. Please come outside.

39:30.209 --> 39:34.212
Anyone who leaves this
building will be shot.

39:34.213 --> 39:37.583
We will take a head count now
and again in the morning.

39:37.584 --> 39:41.554
If one person is missing,

39:41.555 --> 39:44.389
Five of you will be executed.

39:44.390 --> 39:47.626
If two are missing,
ten will be shot.

39:47.627 --> 39:50.362
And so on.

39:50.363 --> 39:53.732
Tomorrow we will begin a
head count every hour...

39:53.733 --> 39:56.234
On the hour.

39:56.235 --> 39:58.370
If all goes well,

39:58.371 --> 40:00.973
you will be allowed
out into the quad.

40:00.974 --> 40:05.878
But every hour on the hour,

40:06.847 --> 40:09.515
you must be in this
room to be counted.

40:09.516 --> 40:11.817
Is that understood?

40:12.586 --> 40:14.820
Second.

40:16.389 --> 40:20.092
You have seen these orange wires running
throughout this building and outside.

40:21.094 --> 40:23.929
These are wired to explosives.

40:23.930 --> 40:27.199
If any one of these wires is cut,

40:27.200 --> 40:30.002
the explosives will
go off automatically.

40:30.003 --> 40:33.672
If any of the individual
explosives are tampered with,

40:34.875 --> 40:37.176
they will explode!

40:39.045 --> 40:41.446
So...

40:41.447 --> 40:43.949
Don't touch the wires.

40:45.218 --> 40:47.519
Don't touch the explosives.

40:51.958 --> 40:54.202
Ninety-two.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.762
- Over there! Over there! Stop!
- All right, all right.

40:56.763 --> 40:59.965
- Just do as they say.
- Are you okay? Are you all right?

40:59.966 --> 41:01.967
What are you doing?

41:01.968 --> 41:04.203
Ow. Man, stop.

41:14.414 --> 41:16.916
Well, we managed to
stay together anyway.

41:16.917 --> 41:19.919
Yeah, that's my ambition in
life... to die with you guys.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.755
You're the kid they call Yogurt,
right? This is your room?

41:22.756 --> 41:25.873
I'm Derek, and he's Ted,
and yes, this is our room.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.584
Not anymore.

41:28.595 --> 41:31.597
Ah, here we go.

41:31.598 --> 41:34.900
- Put that down!
- I guess some things never change.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.820
You have any sleeping
bags, any blankets?

41:36.821 --> 41:37.269
No.

41:37.270 --> 41:39.508
Do you got any food
around here, candy bars?

41:39.509 --> 41:41.652
- You have any more magazines?
- No!

41:41.653 --> 41:44.388
- This your plane, Yogurt?
- Yeah, I made it.

41:44.389 --> 41:46.445
You understand all this
remote control stuff?

41:46.446 --> 41:48.447
Yes, I do.

41:48.448 --> 41:53.418
The thing the leader's got wrapped
around his wrist? You think it'll work?

41:53.419 --> 41:57.389
- Yeah.
- We're well and truly fucked.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.558
They can't rescue us.
We'd all get killed.

41:59.559 --> 42:03.062
- Then they'll pay the ransom.
- Maybe.

42:03.063 --> 42:05.798
We're gonna do something, right?

42:10.436 --> 42:14.640
We can't just sit by and let these
bastards fuck with our lives.

42:14.641 --> 42:17.409
- Do we have a choice?
- Yes.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.312
Um, guys? Could we
change the subject?

42:20.313 --> 42:24.917
I'd like to go to bed
without wetting my pants.

42:24.918 --> 42:28.654
This is F.B.I. Deputy Assistant
Director Otis Brown.

42:28.655 --> 42:30.823
Who am I speaking to?

42:30.824 --> 42:34.259
This is Dr. Robert Gould,
the Head... Headmaster.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.862
Look, all the boys are here.

42:36.863 --> 42:40.799
They're all alive and in good health.
They're frightened, of course.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.835
- Tell them about the explosives.
- What?

42:42.836 --> 42:46.605
- Explosives.
- There are explosives all over the campus.

42:46.606 --> 42:50.008
He says that if the wires
are cut, they'll blow up.

42:51.845 --> 42:54.613
And he has a remote
control device...

42:54.614 --> 42:57.282
Attached by tape to
the back of his hand.

42:57.283 --> 42:59.985
He says he can blow the school
up by pressing a button.

42:59.986 --> 43:02.287
It is true.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.456
And I will not hesitate.

43:04.457 --> 43:08.694
If you attack the school, my men will
begin shooting students until you stop.

43:08.695 --> 43:13.165
But if by some miracle,
you kill all of my men,

43:13.166 --> 43:17.069
whatever happens, I will still
have time to press the button...

43:17.070 --> 43:20.038
And every one of us will die.

43:21.074 --> 43:23.642
I am releasing the faculty.

43:23.643 --> 43:26.545
One of them will be carrying a
complete list of my demands.

43:26.546 --> 43:29.181
These are nonnegotiable.

43:29.182 --> 43:31.850
If you do not produce
my father unharmed,

43:31.851 --> 43:35.587
I will begin executing
the hostages.

43:35.588 --> 43:39.424
I'm sure by now you have discovered
who these students are...

43:39.425 --> 43:41.927
And who their parents are.

43:41.928 --> 43:44.697
"Rejects." I assume the
students did this.

43:44.698 --> 43:46.699
Yes.

43:46.700 --> 43:50.502
Over half the student body consists of
boys expelled from other prep schools.

43:50.503 --> 43:52.971
- Hence the nickname.
- I see.

43:52.972 --> 43:55.941
No, you don't see.

43:55.942 --> 43:59.945
My boys, many of them have a
real problem with authority.

43:59.946 --> 44:02.981
There's no telling what they might
do in a situation like this.

44:02.982 --> 44:04.917
That could damn well
get 'em killed.

44:04.918 --> 44:07.285
Exactly.

44:07.286 --> 44:10.322
There's one boy in particular.

44:11.390 --> 44:14.126
Here they come.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.135
There's a body.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.908
I think it's Jesse Miller,

44:29.909 --> 44:32.544
the chemistry teacher.

44:32.545 --> 44:37.249
Do you think it's true
about the explosives?

44:37.250 --> 44:40.252
Would he be willing to blow himself
up along with everyone else?

44:40.253 --> 44:45.090
I think he'd be willing to do anything
if he doesn't get his father back.

44:45.091 --> 44:48.293
Anything.

45:28.168 --> 45:30.735
Can't sleep, huh?

45:30.736 --> 45:32.737
Nope.

45:32.738 --> 45:34.739
Yeah, me neither.

45:34.740 --> 45:38.143
None of us can sleep, especially
with you two yapping.

45:39.412 --> 45:41.413
Billy, we gotta do something.

45:41.414 --> 45:44.582
Yeah, we can be cool and
wait to be rescued.

45:44.583 --> 45:46.584
Anybody know morse code?

45:46.585 --> 45:49.487
With that light and a mirror, we
could send signals back and forth.

45:49.488 --> 45:53.391
No, Billy! Nobody knows morse code.

45:53.392 --> 45:55.627
For Christ's sakes.

46:01.767 --> 46:04.636
Well, we got the perfect
number for poker.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.339
Anybody got a deck of cards?

46:07.340 --> 46:10.209
You can't smoke in the dorms.

46:10.210 --> 46:12.878
What are they gonna
do, kick me out?

46:12.879 --> 46:15.113
Shut up, you guys.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.652
Shut the door, go to sleep!

46:20.653 --> 46:24.523
Hey, Joey, shut the door.
Shut the door.

46:27.894 --> 46:30.048
There's one of them
at the end of the hall.

46:30.049 --> 46:31.555
Yeah?

46:35.168 --> 46:39.171
So we make some noise
and we get him in here.

46:39.172 --> 46:41.739
And then we jump him.

46:42.508 --> 46:44.576
Then what?

46:44.577 --> 46:50.106
Billy, he's got a fuckin' machine gun.
With a fucking machine gun...

46:50.107 --> 46:52.551
- ...we could shred these fuckers!
- Joey.

46:52.552 --> 46:55.320
This machine gun stuff must
run in mafia families.

46:55.321 --> 46:59.057
- You son of a bitch!
- Joey! Ow! Joey!

46:59.058 --> 47:02.261
- Come on, man.
- That was a joke, okay?

47:02.262 --> 47:05.330
I'm your friend. I can call
you a wop if I want to.

47:05.331 --> 47:07.332
Quiet.

47:07.333 --> 47:11.469
- They're crazy.
- Kiss and make up.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.281
I'm sorry.

47:22.282 --> 47:25.217
Just don't call me
a wop, all right?

47:25.218 --> 47:29.121
Sure. Is it okay if I
call you an asshole?

47:29.122 --> 47:31.556
Sure. Asshole, dickhead. Whatever.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.558
Fuck face.

47:33.559 --> 47:36.895
All right, enough of this
machine gun stuff, Joey.

47:36.896 --> 47:39.231
Oh, okay, mom.

47:39.232 --> 47:41.400
You think of a better idea.

47:41.401 --> 47:44.102
- You wanna know what we should do?
- No.

47:44.103 --> 47:47.639
We need to find out everything about
these guys who are holding us.

47:47.640 --> 47:50.475
How many there are, what kind of
guns they have, all that stuff.

47:50.476 --> 47:53.178
Then we need to get that
information to the outside world.

47:53.179 --> 47:55.547
Then they can get in and rescue us.

47:55.548 --> 47:58.083
It's a very cool idea. Let's do it.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.986
That sounds like a lot of
effort for underachievers.

48:00.987 --> 48:05.089
The difference is, if the Dean
catches you, he doesn't kill you.

48:05.992 --> 48:10.195
- Are you with me or not?
- What do you...

48:10.196 --> 48:12.297
Of course we're with you, man.

48:12.298 --> 48:16.000
But if you get us shot,
we're gonna be pissed.

48:18.304 --> 48:22.274
Parents of the hostages being held at the
Regis school have been arriving all day...

48:22.275 --> 48:25.877
And are being urged by F.B.I.
Officials to stay at a local motel.

48:25.878 --> 48:29.046
We'll try and talk with some
of the parents. Excuse me.

49:04.683 --> 49:06.684
Jerry, come on, man.

49:06.685 --> 49:09.421
Bring that back.

49:22.068 --> 49:27.506
Now, gentlemen, this object
I'm holding here is called...

49:27.507 --> 49:30.208
some of you may have seen one of
these before. It's called a book.

49:30.209 --> 49:32.610
You may have seen
one on television.

49:32.611 --> 49:35.713
Fellas, the ball's over here.
Thank you very much.

49:35.714 --> 49:39.451
Don't pay any attention to them.

49:40.286 --> 49:43.288
Sooner or later,
they'll all be gone.

49:43.289 --> 49:45.990
Oh, yes, but this book...

49:45.991 --> 49:50.294
Will be important... Forever.

49:55.734 --> 49:57.969
Guard.

50:03.509 --> 50:06.844
Hey, Gube. Heard you brought a breakfast
tray up to the lookouts in west hall.

50:06.845 --> 50:08.846
- Yeah.
- What room were they in?

50:08.847 --> 50:10.915
- They were in the infirmary.
- How many?

50:10.916 --> 50:13.718
- Two.
- What kind of stuff do they have?

50:13.719 --> 50:15.920
What do you mean? What stuff?

50:15.921 --> 50:19.257
- Guns, grenades. That kind of stuff.
- They had tons of it.

50:19.258 --> 50:22.427
All kinds. A big machine gun.

50:22.428 --> 50:25.530
Wait a minute. I'm not gonna
get in trouble for this, am I?

50:25.531 --> 50:27.966
Don't be a wuss. Describe
the machine gun.

50:27.967 --> 50:31.236
Why don't you send your troops in
there and shoot the sons of bitches?

50:31.237 --> 50:33.738
You are crazy. Just shut up.

50:33.739 --> 50:38.276
Did you realize that the head
of the New Jersey mafia...

50:38.277 --> 50:40.445
Is here in this room?

50:40.446 --> 50:42.581
I see him.

50:42.582 --> 50:44.583
Knowing that,

50:44.584 --> 50:47.652
you let him send his
son to your school?

50:47.653 --> 50:49.654
Of course.

50:49.655 --> 50:52.524
It's not the boy's fault
who his father is.

50:52.525 --> 50:55.560
The F.B.I. advises parents
to pay the ransom.

50:55.561 --> 50:57.962
Why don't you just give
the guy what he wants?

50:57.963 --> 51:00.898
In the first place, the F.B.I.
Has no such policy.

51:00.899 --> 51:05.470
But beyond that, your sons
haven't been kidnapped.

51:05.471 --> 51:08.840
They're being held hostage
by a gang of terrorists.

51:08.841 --> 51:11.576
As we know, it's United
States policy...

51:11.577 --> 51:14.312
Not to accede to terrorist demands.

51:14.313 --> 51:19.117
That policy is gonna have to change. We'll
go to the white house if we have to!

51:19.118 --> 51:22.754
My family isn't rich. We don't
have influence at the white house.

51:22.755 --> 51:25.243
My son is on a full
scholarship to the school.

51:25.244 --> 51:26.057
So is mine.

51:26.058 --> 51:29.994
We should talk to the press. Why should
our kids suffer alongside the rich kids?

51:29.995 --> 51:32.397
Nobody should go to
the white house.

51:32.398 --> 51:34.599
Nobody should talk to the press.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.934
I know how much of
a strain this is,

51:36.935 --> 51:39.937
but you could be putting your
sons in even greater danger.

51:39.938 --> 51:43.275
So please, let the
experts handle this.

51:51.750 --> 51:54.419
80, 81, 82,

51:54.420 --> 51:57.222
83, 84, 85,

51:57.223 --> 51:59.224
86, 87,

51:59.225 --> 52:01.793
88, 89,

52:01.794 --> 52:04.696
90, 91, 92.

52:05.964 --> 52:07.999
Back outside now, please.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.903
Beyond saying there is an adequate
number, I'm not prepared to comment.

52:11.904 --> 52:14.406
Are the hostages safe at this time?

52:14.407 --> 52:17.409
The hostages are obviously in
a very dangerous situation...

52:17.410 --> 52:20.378
And will be so until
they are released.

52:20.379 --> 52:22.380
Everybody's accounted for.

52:22.381 --> 52:25.083
Are negotiations in progress
now with the terrorists?

52:25.084 --> 52:27.985
This administration has never
waivered from the policy...

52:27.986 --> 52:32.591
That the United States must never
give in to the demands of terrorists.

52:32.592 --> 52:37.095
To do so would only encourage
more hostage taking.

52:37.096 --> 52:39.330
Well, we'll see.

52:43.953 --> 52:46.654
- Hey, man, I'm supposed to...
- We know.

52:47.990 --> 52:50.458
- Be careful, man.
- You bet.

52:53.262 --> 52:56.464
I'm supposed to take this
to your guys upstairs.

53:34.070 --> 53:36.304
Lunch.

53:48.084 --> 53:50.751
Enjoy.

54:10.472 --> 54:13.274
We got two guards
in the bell tower,

54:13.275 --> 54:16.477
two more in the attic
of fisher hall.

54:16.478 --> 54:20.048
There's two in the infirmary and
two more on the roof of west hall.

54:20.049 --> 54:22.050
That's eight.

54:22.051 --> 54:25.553
Three in the quad makes 11, and
the leader in the office is 12.

54:25.554 --> 54:28.123
His name is Luis Cali.

54:28.124 --> 54:32.260
And the three guys in the quad...
that's Jorge, Ruiz and Carlos.

54:32.261 --> 54:34.262
That's right. You speak Spanish.

54:34.263 --> 54:36.497
Don't forget the American
guy with the glasses.

54:36.498 --> 54:39.567
That makes 13. This man.

54:53.649 --> 54:56.818
- You know Vinny?
- Vinny.

54:56.819 --> 55:01.322
The F.B.I.'s crawling all over me. I
didn't even wanna use a pay phone.

55:01.323 --> 55:04.525
- You seen the news?
- Yeah, of course.

55:04.526 --> 55:07.395
This Enrique Cali... the
old man who's in prison...

55:07.396 --> 55:09.297
he's been around. We've
done business with him.

55:09.298 --> 55:11.766
I know the Bars brothers
are in with him very big.

55:11.767 --> 55:13.840
So is Dino Frenetti
and his boy Micky.

55:13.841 --> 55:16.604
All right. I want you to
reach out to them fast.

55:16.605 --> 55:19.440
Tell them to get to the old
man and explain about my son.

55:19.441 --> 55:22.277
All right. It's done, right away.

55:22.278 --> 55:25.146
The kid hates me.

55:25.147 --> 55:27.916
Albert, hey, hey.

55:27.917 --> 55:31.485
Kids are kids. They go
through, uh, a stage.

55:31.486 --> 55:35.023
They're ashamed of us.
Hey, it's just a phase.

55:35.024 --> 55:39.393
No, it's different with Joey.
He really hates me.

55:39.394 --> 55:41.395
But what can I do?

55:41.396 --> 55:45.466
I love him... And I
want him out of there.

55:45.467 --> 55:48.802
- It's done. Right away, okay?
- Go ahead.

55:50.372 --> 55:54.275
Billy, we've got enough to do
without you thinking up more ideas.

55:54.276 --> 55:57.397
Excuse me, I'm having a private
conversation with Yogurt.

55:57.398 --> 55:58.046
Billy!

55:58.047 --> 56:01.110
This is the chip that sends
radio signals to the plane?

56:01.111 --> 56:02.116
Right.

56:02.117 --> 56:04.986
And it's the same kind of chip that
he's got in the garage door opener,

56:04.987 --> 56:07.956
the thing wrapped around his wrist,
the one that controls the explosives?

56:07.957 --> 56:11.025
Well, it should be. I mean, all
chips aren't standardized.

56:11.026 --> 56:14.528
Then if we could somehow
switch these chips,

56:14.529 --> 56:17.732
then we would control the bombs and he
would control the plane with his wrist deal.

56:17.733 --> 56:20.668
- Right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

56:20.669 --> 56:24.839
First of all, the guy's got the remote
control tied around his wrist all the time.

56:24.840 --> 56:28.609
- How you gonna get it?
- I think he has a point.

56:28.610 --> 56:29.744
He could be knocked out.

56:29.745 --> 56:33.031
There's no way that anybody could
knock him out without giving him time

56:33.032 --> 56:36.585
to press the button. And his men
would just shoot you if you did.

56:36.586 --> 56:37.618
Maybe.

56:37.619 --> 56:40.121
Even if you could get it,
why switch the chips?

56:40.122 --> 56:42.556
You can just take the thing
and flush it down the toilet.

56:42.557 --> 56:45.226
We're getting the information out.
I guess we're doing all we can do.

56:45.227 --> 56:47.929
- What do you think of this?
- Is it legible?

56:47.930 --> 56:50.965
Only if you know how to read.

56:50.966 --> 56:53.534
I told you the searchlight
would be important.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.536
That's great, Joey.
"If you know how to read."

56:55.537 --> 56:59.573
Of course, the reverse
is also true.

56:59.574 --> 57:02.610
What the hell do you mean,
"The reverse is also true"?

57:02.611 --> 57:05.179
What I mean is if you
take the other chip...

57:05.180 --> 57:07.681
the receiving chip...
out of the plane,

57:07.682 --> 57:11.052
then you can replace it with the
receiving chip from the detonator.

57:11.053 --> 57:13.388
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

57:13.389 --> 57:16.590
Now all we have to do is get Cali
out of the Headmaster's office,

57:16.591 --> 57:20.061
which he hardly ever leaves,
sneak past the guard,

57:20.062 --> 57:22.063
switch the chips without
setting off the bombs...

57:22.064 --> 57:24.232
And then get out
without being seen.

57:24.233 --> 57:26.867
That's right. That's it exactly.

57:26.868 --> 57:28.869
I was attempting to be sarcastic.

57:28.870 --> 57:31.806
You shouldn't have been. You
should have been writing it down.

57:31.807 --> 57:34.409
Stop it, Billy. You're
beginning to scare me.

57:34.410 --> 57:38.712
84, 85, 86, 87, 88,

57:38.713 --> 57:43.016
89, 90, 91, 92.

57:43.785 --> 57:46.187
Take 'em out.

57:46.188 --> 57:48.189
You may go outside now.

57:48.190 --> 57:51.925
I'd like to see the sophomore
class by the bench, please.

58:02.771 --> 58:05.239
Reggie. Over here, man. Come on.

58:18.153 --> 58:22.090
You got till exactly 45 minutes past
the hour to get back to the trees.

58:22.091 --> 58:24.892
- That's the big hand on the little nine.
- I'll be there.

58:24.893 --> 58:27.161
- Wait until they look the other way.
- Okay.

58:27.162 --> 58:30.063
- Ready?
- Ready.

58:34.603 --> 58:37.605
- Watch yourself, man.
- Kick the ball!

59:04.566 --> 59:06.801
All right.

59:55.217 --> 01:00:00.121
Roosevelt represented a
profoundly different view...

01:00:00.122 --> 01:00:02.390
Of the role of the
federal government.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:07.228
- Start it up.
- All right. Looks good to me.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:10.130
All right, pick it up.
Get it ready.

01:00:14.803 --> 01:00:17.505
Let her go.

01:00:18.373 --> 01:00:20.741
A view that, uh, troubled
the government...

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.910
In economic life...

01:00:25.981 --> 01:00:29.717
You really can fly it, huh, Derek?

01:00:46.335 --> 01:00:49.003
Oh, sh...

01:00:49.004 --> 01:00:50.871
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

01:00:50.872 --> 01:00:53.674
Oh, dear.

01:01:00.682 --> 01:01:03.517
Hey, you...

01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:22.703
Be on the alert.

01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:32.813
Shut it down now.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.600
Jorge, give it to me.

01:01:44.426 --> 01:01:47.862
Man, come on!

01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:09.208
Hands on your head!

01:02:09.209 --> 01:02:11.561
Oh, great. Look.
I'm from the school.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.455
Here's all the information you
need about the people holding us.

01:02:14.456 --> 01:02:16.924
Be careful with it.
We're all fine so far.

01:02:16.925 --> 01:02:19.827
- Nice outfit. I gotta run.
- You gotta wait for the boss.

01:02:19.828 --> 01:02:22.563
I gotta get back before
somebody knows I'm gone!

01:02:22.564 --> 01:02:26.166
Kid, I'm sorry, but you're not going
anywhere until we check you out.

01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:28.469
You have a student named Tepper?

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:33.006
Yes. Billy Tepper. I've been
waiting for something from him.

01:02:33.007 --> 01:02:35.743
- Just keep him there.
- What's he done?

01:02:35.744 --> 01:02:38.212
There's a helicopter
on the pad outside.

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:42.617
If he is one of your boys, go get
him and bring him back here.

01:02:42.618 --> 01:02:46.019
Roosevelt, by using the radio,

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.889
was able to speak to
the American people...

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.091
This is coffee.

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:20.247
If you are who you say you are, we
cannot let you go back. They'd kill you.

01:04:20.248 --> 01:04:23.250
That's my problem. I can make it.
I've gotta go right now.

01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:26.354
- Billy.
- You gotta get me out of here, sir.

01:04:26.355 --> 01:04:28.255
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:04:28.256 --> 01:04:29.724
- You know this kid?
- Yes, of course.

01:04:29.725 --> 01:04:31.726
They're gonna shoot five
kids if I don't go back.

01:04:31.727 --> 01:04:33.109
They're gonna shoot
you if you do go back.

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.147
I can make it. You know
I can't lie to you.

01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:39.357
You gotta know I'm
telling you the truth.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.471
I believe you. Let him go.

01:04:43.472 --> 01:04:45.906
I cannot accept that
responsibility.

01:04:45.907 --> 01:04:48.008
Let him go.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:52.146
Get him! Stop the kid before
he gets himself killed.

01:04:59.788 --> 01:05:02.022
Any second now.

01:05:53.942 --> 01:05:56.209
Where the hell is he?

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.546
He'll be here. He'll be here.

01:06:30.679 --> 01:06:33.346
Oh, geez!

01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:50.264
He's got a minute.

01:06:52.868 --> 01:06:55.969
Oh, shit!

01:07:07.281 --> 01:07:10.450
Please, God.

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:36.810
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:39.980
- What do we do?
- We wait.

01:07:39.981 --> 01:07:43.750
Damn! It's already too late, man.

01:07:46.755 --> 01:07:49.456
71, 72, 73,

01:07:49.457 --> 01:07:52.560
74, 75, 76, 77,

01:07:52.561 --> 01:07:55.629
78, 79, 80, 81,

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:59.633
82, 83, 84, 85, 86...

01:07:59.634 --> 01:08:01.702
get back in line!
I already counted you.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:05.973
87, 88, 89, 90, 91.

01:08:06.841 --> 01:08:09.943
- It's still 91.
- Count them again.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.805
Two helicopters are
coming towards us.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:26.609
Okay. Open fire and prevent
them from getting closer.

01:08:44.345 --> 01:08:48.716
One, two, three, four, five...

01:08:48.716 --> 01:08:51.184
86, 87, 88,

01:08:51.185 --> 01:08:53.185
89, 90, 91.

01:08:53.187 --> 01:08:55.755
We got one boy missing.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:08.401
I told you what would happen
if one of you escaped.

01:09:08.402 --> 01:09:10.670
Did you think I was kidding?

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.785
You first.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.453
Let's go. Face against
the wall. Come on.

01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:30.457
You too.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.693
You!

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:40.067
You! Get over there!

01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:43.737
And you. Run.

01:09:43.738 --> 01:09:47.107
Run.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.911
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:54.214
I was in the shower.
I didn't hear the bell ring.

01:09:54.215 --> 01:09:56.216
He's wet.

01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:58.719
- I'm sorry.
- So he is.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.155
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:04.225 --> 01:10:06.794
Okay, let's go. Get back
in line. It's all over.

01:10:06.795 --> 01:10:09.329
Come on! Go!

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.732
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Come on. Go.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.207
My father sent me to a school
that looked a lot like this one.

01:10:23.111 --> 01:10:25.678
A military academy in Pennsylvania.

01:10:27.248 --> 01:10:31.218
Perhaps you've heard of it...
the Armitage school?

01:10:31.219 --> 01:10:33.487
Uh, yeah, I think so.

01:10:35.423 --> 01:10:38.092
You really have no sense
of discipline, do you?

01:10:38.093 --> 01:10:41.095
Look, I'm sorry about the
shower thing. I promise...

01:10:41.096 --> 01:10:43.163
Oh, shit.

01:10:43.164 --> 01:10:45.199
- This is how they taught me discipline,
- Oh, shit.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.868
And believe you me,

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:51.038
I learned.

01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:57.978
This basement the kid is talking
about, it's not on the plans.

01:10:57.979 --> 01:10:59.980
It exists. I've been in it.

01:10:59.981 --> 01:11:02.682
There used to be a building right
here behind where the kitchen is.

01:11:02.683 --> 01:11:04.684
That's a subbasement
in that building.

01:11:04.685 --> 01:11:06.996
There's no building
directly above it then.

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:07.988
That's right.

01:11:07.989 --> 01:11:10.323
So if the hostages were
in the basement...

01:11:10.324 --> 01:11:12.726
And the buildings blew up,
they'd probably survive.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:16.230
That building was built in 1881.

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:20.901
They built to last back in those days.
What about the explosives?

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.290
It's interesting what the kid says

01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:24.905
about switching the chips in
the remote control receiver.

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:27.975
- Could it work?
- It's very possible.

01:11:27.976 --> 01:11:31.678
I wouldn't wanna take the responsibility
for letting the kid try this,

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:34.214
but it could work.

01:11:34.215 --> 01:11:37.818
Take it easy. It's over.

01:11:37.819 --> 01:11:40.254
Washington has authorized
me to make a deal.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:42.422
What are we giving them?

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:45.192
Whatever it takes to
get the hostages free.

01:11:45.193 --> 01:11:47.694
We have a shot at a
successful assault here.

01:11:47.695 --> 01:11:50.030
We know the location
of every terrorist.

01:11:50.031 --> 01:11:53.733
The kid can get the other
students out of the line of fire.

01:11:53.734 --> 01:11:56.870
What kid? This kid has been
kicked out of two schools.

01:11:56.871 --> 01:11:59.072
- No, three schools.
- Three schools.

01:11:59.073 --> 01:12:01.842
Come on. All of this is unreliable.

01:12:01.843 --> 01:12:05.745
Well, that's not really true. I may not
rely on Billy getting to class on time,

01:12:05.746 --> 01:12:08.581
but I would rely on this.

01:12:08.582 --> 01:12:12.452
- Why?
- Because he's got guts. He's a leader.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.956
You can see that he's, uh,
thought this thing through.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:20.527
Now, if Billy says he can do
it, I gotta believe he can.

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:25.098
If everything goes perfect,

01:12:25.099 --> 01:12:28.969
could we guarantee no
casualties among the hostages?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:32.872
Guarantee? No, of course not.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:36.776
Then our orders are to cut a deal.

01:12:36.777 --> 01:12:38.778
That's unacceptable.

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:41.781
The demands in my letter
must be followed exactly.

01:12:41.782 --> 01:12:43.783
I'll have to go back
to my superiors.

01:12:43.784 --> 01:12:47.321
- We'll need time to discuss this.
- I understand.

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:50.891
In recognition of your
willingness to negotiate,

01:12:50.892 --> 01:12:54.294
the execution scheduled for 5:00
P.M. today will be postponed.

01:12:54.295 --> 01:12:59.399
However, if we have not concluded
a deal by 5:00 P.M. tomorrow,

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.569
There will be no further delays.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.175
We won.

01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:51.218
We just got a message
from Albert Trotta.

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:54.187
Trotta's kid, Joey, goes
to the Regis school.

01:13:54.188 --> 01:13:56.390
He naturally wants him out.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:59.259
And he'd be a good guy
to have owe us a favor.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.794
Give me something to write with.

01:14:09.137 --> 01:14:11.971
Give this message to my son.

01:14:13.674 --> 01:14:16.543
They're receiving another message.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:38.732
It's the Headmaster.

01:14:43.037 --> 01:14:45.305
How you feeling?

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.707
Okay.

01:14:47.708 --> 01:14:50.010
Come to my office,
will you, Mr. Trotta?

01:14:50.011 --> 01:14:52.946
- They want to see you.
- Why?

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:57.016
I don't think they mean you
any harm. I'll go with you.

01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:02.255
- It's all right.
- Okay.

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:24.344
We're letting you go.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.081
- What?
- You're free to go.

01:15:28.082 --> 01:15:30.984
These men will take you
to the main entrance.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:34.754
All you have to do is
walk down the driveway.

01:15:36.957 --> 01:15:39.192
Why me?

01:15:40.395 --> 01:15:43.330
Because we respect your father.

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.533
Fuck my father...

01:15:46.534 --> 01:15:49.068
And fuck you.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.805
I'm not going anywhere
without my friends.

01:15:52.806 --> 01:15:55.108
Oh, yes, you are.

01:15:55.109 --> 01:15:57.511
Don't fight him! Just go!

01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:59.513
Ow! Oh!

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:02.249
Let go of me!

01:16:04.752 --> 01:16:07.187
Okay, okay, all right.

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:09.856
I'm going. I'm going.

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:30.143
Joey! No! Joey!

01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:32.479
Let me go!

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:44.491
- Jorge!
- Let me go!

01:16:44.492 --> 01:16:47.126
Joey! Joey!

01:16:50.364 --> 01:16:52.599
Oh, you fucker!

01:16:57.171 --> 01:17:00.200
- You son of a bitch!
- Okay!

01:17:01.073 --> 01:17:02.584
Bring him inside!

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:07.171
Get in the room!

01:17:07.281 --> 01:17:09.783
Inside, let's go.

01:18:12.046 --> 01:18:14.848
Please wait there.

01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:32.299
It is very important that
you explain to them...

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.867
That we did not want
to kill this boy.

01:18:34.868 --> 01:18:37.571
We were releasing him, in fact.

01:18:37.572 --> 01:18:41.341
But he suddenly attacked my men and
they were forced to shoot him.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.678
I would like to see the Headmaster
and the other students, please.

01:18:44.679 --> 01:18:46.165
Not possible.

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:49.482
Then release the Headmaster
and take me instead.

01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:51.285
No.

01:18:52.886 --> 01:18:55.589
It is very important
that you tell them...

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:59.393
We did not intend to kill
this boy. It was an accident.

01:18:59.394 --> 01:19:02.095
It wouldn't have happened if you
hadn't come here in the first place.

01:19:02.096 --> 01:19:05.665
It wouldn't have happened if the American
government hadn't kidnapped my father!

01:19:05.666 --> 01:19:09.502
Now, we will leave as soon as
my father is returned to me.

01:19:09.503 --> 01:19:12.038
You tell them that.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:16.175
You tell them that this one was an
accident, but the next one won't be.

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:31.491
They're gonna hunt you down,
you know that, don't you?

01:19:31.492 --> 01:19:35.461
They'll eventually find you,
and then they will kill you.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.135
You Americans always say that,

01:19:42.136 --> 01:19:45.038
but you never actually do it.

01:19:58.786 --> 01:20:01.287
God, I am sorry.

01:20:02.122 --> 01:20:04.758
It's a lie... this stuff
about an accident.

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:08.828
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's what they claim.

01:20:08.829 --> 01:20:12.399
How does a kid have an accident that
gets him shot with a machine gun?

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.968
I don't know.

01:20:16.804 --> 01:20:19.706
These people are grown-ups,

01:20:19.707 --> 01:20:21.941
not like my son.

01:20:23.177 --> 01:20:27.580
It's time they found out there's
no such thing as an accident.

01:22:37.478 --> 01:22:39.746
The president has
waived Posse Comitatus,

01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:42.315
and we have orders to proceed
with the assault as planned.

01:22:42.316 --> 01:22:46.152
Our assault teams are to move out
to the helicopters and stand by.

01:22:46.153 --> 01:22:50.356
Cut the power to the campus and jam
everything... radio, TV, microwave.

01:22:50.357 --> 01:22:53.960
- I want an absolute and total blackout.
- What's going on?

01:22:53.961 --> 01:22:58.731
Yesterday your boy Billy Tepper suddenly
appeared on our side of the wire.

01:22:58.732 --> 01:23:00.733
How'd he do that?

01:23:00.734 --> 01:23:04.604
There's an old storm drain on the
east edge of the campus right there.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:07.807
It's got bars on it, but the boys
always manage to get through.

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:10.743
- What's happening?
- Could you show our explosives expert...

01:23:10.744 --> 01:23:12.779
How to get through that drain?

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.781
Of course. What's happening?

01:23:14.782 --> 01:23:16.950
Enrique Cali was just
murdered in prison.

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:20.432
As soon as Luis Cali finds out
about his father's death,

01:23:20.433 --> 01:23:24.266
he'll start killing hostages. He
could very well blow up the school.

01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:26.559
We've got no choice.
We have to go in.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.596
We're doing everything we
can, but I gotta tell you,

01:23:29.597 --> 01:23:34.501
the casualties could be high unless
your boy does what he says he can do.

01:23:34.502 --> 01:23:38.504
- He'll try.
- He better.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.716
- Billy, wake up.
- I'm awake.

01:23:49.717 --> 01:23:53.386
That's the signal. They're going
to attack and they want our help.

01:23:53.387 --> 01:23:56.890
They're crazy. What the hell do they think
we can do? We'll get everybody killed.

01:23:56.891 --> 01:24:00.493
- This was your idea.
- It's too late to back out now.

01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:01.763
No, it isn't.

01:24:01.764 --> 01:24:03.563
They're depending on
us to do what we said!

01:24:03.564 --> 01:24:07.133
They'll stop depending on
us when we don't answer.

01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:14.807
You asshole! Give me that!

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.713
Get off me!

01:24:20.714 --> 01:24:23.382
Maybe it was a mistake
to follow your plan,

01:24:23.383 --> 01:24:25.718
but we did because
you wanted us to.

01:24:25.719 --> 01:24:28.888
Now it's too late to back out. We
can't back out and neither can you.

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:32.124
I've been a major fuckup my
whole life. I'll get you all killed.

01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:33.993
Come on, man.

01:24:33.994 --> 01:24:36.729
I'm sorry. The cuts on your back.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:40.132
Forget about the cuts. That's the
least of our problems right now.

01:24:40.133 --> 01:24:43.870
Your plan is just as good now as it was
yesterday when we thought it was great.

01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:45.981
- We were wrong yesterday.
- No, stop this, Billy!

01:24:45.982 --> 01:24:47.849
You got us into it.
You gotta get us out.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.842
If you say, "Do it for Joey,"
I'm gonna fucking puke.

01:24:49.843 --> 01:24:53.980
We don't have to tell
you why. You know why.

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:05.391
You're fucking morons.

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:08.794
You know that, don't you?
You're fucking morons.

01:25:12.132 --> 01:25:15.134
That's why we hang with you, Billy.

01:25:16.503 --> 01:25:21.440
- We're really gonna do this?
- You bet.

01:25:21.441 --> 01:25:25.544
All right, we got a lot of
work to do, especially you.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.615
Me?

01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:07.219
Are you there? What
are you trying to do?

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:10.322
You see, there's been a power
failure affecting the whole county.

01:26:10.323 --> 01:26:12.358
- They're working on it.
- I see.

01:26:12.359 --> 01:26:15.227
You have exactly one
hour to fix the power.

01:26:15.228 --> 01:26:18.564
Then I kill one hostage every
15 minutes until it's back on.

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.042
All right now, just relax.
Try and act natural.

01:26:35.683 --> 01:26:40.252
The next guy comes out of the
bathroom, you two go, all right?

01:26:40.253 --> 01:26:43.656
When you come out of the storm drain, if you
stay to the right as you go up the hill,

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:46.258
you'll be under cover until you
get to this point right here.

01:26:46.259 --> 01:26:49.295
It would be a lot easier
if I went along with you.

01:26:49.296 --> 01:26:51.630
I'm sorry, sir. We
can't let you do that.

01:26:51.631 --> 01:26:54.533
We'll be fine with the map.

01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:06.879
Hey, you guys all set?

01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:14.198
If there's any problem,
just turn off the water.

01:27:14.199 --> 01:27:16.723
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:27:22.329 --> 01:27:25.364
You sure this goes to the
Headmaster's office?

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:28.901
How do you think I broke in to get
the Headmaster's furniture out?

01:27:28.902 --> 01:27:31.370
How do you think I got
the algebra final?

01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:36.042
Geez Louise, Yogurt, you'd think we were
going to defuse a bomb or something.

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:39.711
It was a joke, Yogurt. Lighten up.

01:28:11.611 --> 01:28:13.912
Hey, man, are you okay?

01:28:19.653 --> 01:28:21.654
Get his medicine!

01:28:21.655 --> 01:28:23.656
Come on, quick. Out of the way.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.059
- Boss!
- What do you want?

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.446
One of the students has a
problem, you should come.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:43.325
I don't know, he can't breath.

01:29:11.205 --> 01:29:13.772
All right, now what?

01:29:13.773 --> 01:29:17.443
- You see that box?
- Yeah.

01:29:17.444 --> 01:29:20.664
No, no, no! That's the detonator.
Don't touch that box.

01:29:20.665 --> 01:29:24.550
It's the other box... the blue box.
The one with the light on it.

01:29:24.551 --> 01:29:28.220
That's the remote control
receiver. Take the casing off.

01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:33.492
Do any of your men have medical
training? This boy's very sick.

01:29:44.238 --> 01:29:46.772
All right, what now?

01:29:46.773 --> 01:29:49.975
All right, all right,
very, very carefully...

01:29:49.976 --> 01:29:52.678
Take the red chip out
of the receiver.

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:55.314
Okay.

01:29:56.750 --> 01:30:00.986
- There is no red chip.
- There must be.

01:30:04.158 --> 01:30:06.492
Well, I'm sorry, there isn't.

01:30:06.493 --> 01:30:10.229
There's a blue chip the same size as
the red chip, but there's no red chip.

01:30:11.432 --> 01:30:13.466
That must be it then.

01:30:13.467 --> 01:30:16.435
Well, is it or isn't it?

01:30:17.404 --> 01:30:19.638
I don't know.

01:30:26.947 --> 01:30:30.450
This boy has a history of medical
problems. You can see how sick he is.

01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:33.586
You must call an ambulance.

01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:13.793
Okay, it should just slide in now.

01:31:32.443 --> 01:31:34.078
Oh, shit!

01:32:04.278 --> 01:32:06.846
Watch out. I'm coming up.

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:19.124
Damn it. I can't just wait here.

01:32:27.334 --> 01:32:29.768
Prepare to engage targets.

01:32:30.704 --> 01:32:32.705
Confirm target acquisition.

01:32:32.706 --> 01:32:35.173
- Targets are up.
- Fire.

01:32:41.715 --> 01:32:43.749
He's got a history of asthma.

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:46.552
Oh.

01:32:49.989 --> 01:32:53.792
- I'm feeling a little better, sir.
- Good, good.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.645
- What was that?
- What was that?

01:33:22.138 --> 01:33:24.898
Hello! Hello!

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:23.382
Hello! Hello! Hello!

01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:25.826
It's not gonna work.
They jammed the radios.

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:27.920
Okay, Jack. Go take a look!

01:34:42.502 --> 01:34:45.004
Shh. Listen.

01:34:47.541 --> 01:34:50.909
Do you hear water running?

01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:53.111
Yes.

01:34:53.112 --> 01:34:56.715
Oh, good. I thought we
were in trouble. Move.

01:35:21.207 --> 01:35:24.442
There. Now that wasn't
so hard, was it?

01:35:33.987 --> 01:35:36.989
I got him. I got him. I got him!

01:35:42.228 --> 01:35:44.363
Hit him, Yogurt!

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:46.899
Come on, Yogurt. Hit him!

01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:52.271
Forget it. We're
jamming the radios.

01:35:52.272 --> 01:35:55.908
Help me get to the Headmaster's
office... to the detonator...

01:35:55.909 --> 01:35:58.410
Let's go.

01:36:17.163 --> 01:36:20.265
Are you supposed to be here?

01:36:20.266 --> 01:36:22.267
Yeah, I'm on pots and pans.

01:36:22.268 --> 01:36:24.970
"Pozanpans"? What is "Pozanpans"?

01:36:24.971 --> 01:36:28.574
No, pots and pans.

01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:33.278
When they wanna give a kid a really terrible
punishment, they give him pots and pans.

01:36:33.279 --> 01:36:36.582
I have to wash this
shit after every meal.

01:36:36.583 --> 01:36:39.584
- Pots and pans.
- Yeah, pots and pans.

01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.580
Did you hear that?

01:37:27.467 --> 01:37:30.310
Take that! Come with me!

01:37:36.743 --> 01:37:39.378
Come on! Let's go!
Everybody in the kitchen!

01:37:39.379 --> 01:37:42.981
- Everybody in the kitchen!
- Move, move!

01:37:44.651 --> 01:37:48.486
Come on, come on! Move!
Move, move, move, move!

01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:07.973
Go.

01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:29.561
Hurry it up! Come on, get in.

01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:45.051
Stay outside!

01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:52.277
Shh! Shh!

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:55.580
Shh! Shh!

01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:59.217
Ruiz!

01:39:59.218 --> 01:40:01.453
Jorge!

01:40:10.596 --> 01:40:12.831
Jorge?

01:40:21.507 --> 01:40:23.741
Get up!

01:41:08.121 --> 01:41:11.056
Hold your fire. He's got a hostage!

01:41:25.238 --> 01:41:27.213
No one is allowed in here!

01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:34.446
Wait.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:51.905
- Oh, God.
- Careful, Lukas!

01:42:11.918 --> 01:42:14.887
I'm sorry.

01:42:23.663 --> 01:42:25.819
Don't.

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:30.568
- What'll happen if he pulls out the wires?
- The bombs will go off. Shoot him.

01:42:57.864 --> 01:43:00.465
Are you all right?

01:43:00.466 --> 01:43:02.700
Yeah.

01:43:15.281 --> 01:43:17.782
I'm sorry I was such
an asshole to you.

01:43:17.783 --> 01:43:20.206
I mean, now that you saved
my life and everything.

01:43:20.207 --> 01:43:24.703
Oh, it's okay. I never
took it personally.

01:43:24.704 --> 01:43:25.757
Good.

01:43:25.758 --> 01:43:30.595
Hey, congratulations.
You came through.

01:43:30.596 --> 01:43:33.898
You just might graduate
in this lifetime.

01:43:34.667 --> 01:43:36.835
Does that mean I'm
off pots and pans?

01:43:36.836 --> 01:43:40.906
Oh, no. You don't think you're
gonna get off that easy, do you?

01:43:40.907 --> 01:43:44.176
Huh?

01:43:56.489 --> 01:43:58.856
Hey, have you guys seen Billy?

01:44:01.861 --> 01:44:04.897
Hey, have you seen Billy?

01:44:04.898 --> 01:44:07.532
- Where can he be?
- Hey! Hey! Here's an ambulance.

01:44:11.504 --> 01:44:14.139
Is Billy Tepper in there?

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.541
He's not in there.

01:44:18.444 --> 01:44:21.145
No one's seen Billy?

01:44:22.348 --> 01:44:25.918
- Where is he, man?
- Hey! Hey!

01:44:25.919 --> 01:44:28.152
Billy!

01:44:31.991 --> 01:44:35.227
How ya doin'?

01:44:37.263 --> 01:44:39.864
Hey, guys. Hey, Derek.
