10:07.302 --> 10:10.827
he put any conditions
on approving your application.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.701

10:14.744 --> 10:17.442

of the office.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.879

10:45.253 --> 10:47.908
- Listen, I--
I can't go back to Guatemala.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.126
And Joe can't know.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.693
I could never hurt him
like that.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.868
His first wife cheated on him.

10:51.912 --> 10:52.956
- Okay, we understand that,
but it's--

10:53.000 --> 10:55.306
- I can't testify, nunca.
Perdón.

11:04.446 --> 11:04.620
.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.709
- This woman says
O'Toole raped her three times

11:06.753 --> 11:08.145
in exchange for a green card?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.190
- Yes, and we don't believe
that she's the only one.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.931
- Our working theory is

11:10.974 --> 11:13.542
he goes after attractive female
applicants with red flag cases.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.240
- Well, he looks
for discrepancies in age,

11:16.284 --> 11:18.547
race, religion,
social status.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.896
At first

11:19.940 --> 11:21.811
he interviews the couple
separately at his office.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.552
- Then he meets the women
in his minivan

11:23.595 --> 11:25.859
where he tells them,
"You want the green card?

11:25.902 --> 11:27.599
I deserve a little loving,
too."

11:27.643 --> 11:29.819
- And if they
turn O'Toole down,

11:29.863 --> 11:33.736
they wind up in ICE detention,
pending deportation.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.391
Plus, he can deport
their families, too.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.741
- This abuse of power
sickens me.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.438
Do other employees
back up Duane's story?

11:40.482 --> 11:44.965
- Duane is O'Toole's number two
in charge of case assignment.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.270
He's the only one who knows

11:46.314 --> 11:48.142
that O'Toole
is cherry-picking them.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.752
- You want proof, Chief?

11:49.796 --> 11:52.624
Get us access to O'Toole's
computer and his phone records.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.105
- We're dealing with ICE, too?

11:55.149 --> 11:57.760
Best to not ask for warrants
until we have corroboration.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.067
Tell your subway groper
to think harder.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.416
We need more names.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.765
- [sighs]

12:10.294 --> 12:12.209
- Two for lunch?

12:12.253 --> 12:14.734
- Are you Rosamie Klein?

12:14.777 --> 12:17.737
- No, but wait here.
I'll go get her.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.133
- You believing that?
- Nah.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.614
- Hey, I--sorry.
Ms. Klein?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.617
Wait, please.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.013
Sorry, excuse me.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
Ms. Klein?

12:45.373 --> 12:48.289
Hey, hey, hey, hey, we
just want to talk to you, okay?

12:48.332 --> 12:51.118
You're not in any trouble.
We want to help you, okay?

12:51.161 --> 12:52.946
- My green card good.
Not fake.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.383
- We know, we know.
We're here about Rory O'Toole.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.777
- No.
Mr. O'Toole, he never touch me.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.344
- Why would you say that?
We didn't ask.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.998
- I love my husband.
Please go away.

13:02.042 --> 13:05.523
- Did O'Toole ever ask
to meet you alone?

13:05.567 --> 13:06.698
- So we can protect you,

13:06.742 --> 13:09.789
we just want
to talk about what he did.

13:09.832 --> 13:13.314
- I love my husband.
Please, go.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.794
Leave me alone.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.498
- [Irish accent]
Four interviews,

13:23.541 --> 13:25.239
me and my husband
sailed through.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.936
[scoffs]

13:26.980 --> 13:29.069
Then O'Toole says,
"Flag on the play, darling."

13:29.112 --> 13:32.159
He needs one more meeting
with me--after hours.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.856
- Then what happened?

13:33.900 --> 13:36.380
- He picks me up
in his minivan.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.295
Dirtbird had a mattress
in the back.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.644
- What did he say?

13:39.688 --> 13:41.603
- He says
if he grants the green card,

13:41.646 --> 13:43.866
me husband can make love
to me any time.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.956
He says,
"I deserve some loving, too."

13:47.000 --> 13:48.175
I told him I'd rather

13:48.218 --> 13:49.959
put the tailpipe of his minivan
in me mouth.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.178
- Then what'd he do?

13:51.221 --> 13:53.136
- He puts me
in this f'in jumpsuit.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.746
[scoffs]

13:55.356 --> 13:57.227
Maybe I should've
just shagged him.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.881
Got on with my American life,
like.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.404
- You're the victim of a crime.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.928
If you agree to testify,

14:01.971 --> 14:04.278
we can get you a U visa
and you won't be deported.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.324
- My husband Patrick's here
on a green card, too.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.109
O'Toole finds out
I'm testifying,

14:09.152 --> 14:13.330
first thing he'll do is try to
deport Patrick back to Belfast.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.418
[scoffs]

14:14.462 --> 14:16.768
Then he'll have screwed
us both.

14:16.812 --> 14:20.076
- We have two confirmed rapes,
one jailed for saying no.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
- They're not willing
to testify.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.602
- I can ask the US attorney for
a warrant on O'Toole's minivan,

14:24.646 --> 14:26.387
but if I do that the feds
are gonna take the case.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.042
- It's so politically charged
over there right now.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.087
I'm not confident they'll fight
for these victims.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.177
- Agreed, but for these women
to admit what happened to them

14:34.221 --> 14:35.613
is to risk losing everything.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.703
- What if
we brought in our own victims?

14:38.747 --> 14:41.228
I worked a joint task force
with Homeland.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.230
I have a great contact
over there.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.579
Let me see if I can get her

14:44.622 --> 14:46.624
to push
a new green card application

14:46.668 --> 14:48.278
across O'Toole's desk.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.714
- A green card honey trap?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.499
- Do you have the UCs for it?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.067
- I think that I do.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.201
- Okay, what color
is my toothbrush?

14:58.245 --> 14:59.942
- Blue, and you sleep
on the left side of the bed.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.510
- You always spoon me.
And what about my siblings?

15:02.553 --> 15:04.599
- One sister,
but you're not in touch.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.253
- She's troubled.
You can say that.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.298
- But hot.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.778
- Hey.
- [chuckles]

15:09.821 --> 15:12.824
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready?

15:12.868 --> 15:14.043
- Yeah.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.437
- Mr. and Mrs. al-Badeen,
nice to meet you.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.612
- Hi.

15:17.655 --> 15:18.961
- Now before I talk
to you separately,

15:19.005 --> 15:22.269
I want to get
to know you both as a couple.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.705
- That's why we're here.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.272
- So how'd you two meet?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.839
- Well, it's a funny story.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.190
Um, we worked together
for years

15:30.233 --> 15:32.975
and I just always thought
he was attractive, you know?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.281
Funny, smart.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.586
- [Middle Eastern accent]
But it wasn't until

15:35.630 --> 15:37.023
I changed jobs
that we could acknowledge

15:37.066 --> 15:40.113
that we had feelings
for each other.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.853
- Okay, I guess.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.639
Uh, tell me more
about how you spend your time.

15:48.295 --> 15:53.822
- We go out, to, uh, dinner.
Nightclubs.

15:53.865 --> 15:57.826
- As an observant Muslim,
though, you don't drink.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.654
- No.
No, I don't.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.656
- Does your wife?
- Yes.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.571
She loves her martinis.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.095
- How do you feel about that?

16:06.139 --> 16:08.010
- I feel in love with Mandy
as she is.

16:08.054 --> 16:11.492
I don't want or expect her
to change.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.972
That's the beauty of America.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.932
Everyone is free
to be who they are.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.196
If I get my green card,
inshallah,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.329
I'll be free, too.

16:22.372 --> 16:25.941
- I love burgers,
and Fuad likes falafel.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.379
- It'd be tough to decide on a
restaurant for Valentine's Day.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.512
Did you, uh, make plans yet?

16:31.555 --> 16:32.948
- We're gonna stay home

16:32.992 --> 16:35.037
and just order delivery
from two different places.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.431
- That's romantic.
- Yeah.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.173
- It's romantic.
I'm assuming you'll pay?

16:40.216 --> 16:42.740
- I am.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.220
- You usually do.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.526
At least that's, uh,

16:45.569 --> 16:47.006
that's what your credit card
statement tells me.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.181
- Oh, yeah.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.530
And, well,
'cause I make more than Fuad.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.097
I'm a bartender.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.664
- And you're older, as well.
How many years?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.144
- A few.
[chuckles]

16:55.188 --> 16:58.408
But love is love, right?

16:58.452 --> 17:01.237
- Okay.
[sighs]

17:03.979 --> 17:06.199
I'll be honest with you,
Mrs. al-Badeen.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.331
Um...

17:08.375 --> 17:13.554
your age difference, economic,
religious, these--

17:13.597 --> 17:15.164
they're all red flags.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.168
- Oh, we're in love.
I mean, this marriage is real.

17:19.212 --> 17:22.563
- I've had a number of women
in your position believe that.

17:22.606 --> 17:23.955
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.699
- I'm gonna go over your file.

17:28.743 --> 17:32.529
But I may need
to meet you one more time.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.184
- With Fuad?
- No, just you.

17:35.228 --> 17:38.057
And I'd ask you not
to tell him.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.407
It could affect the status
of his green card application.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.366
- Oh, okay.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.239
Uh, when do you wanna meet?

17:46.282 --> 17:50.156
- Uh, I'll call you.
On your cell?

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
- Sure.
- Great.

18:01.036 --> 18:01.993
- Hey.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.345
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.650
- Right on time.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.739
- [sighs]

18:11.002 --> 18:14.005
- You look really pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.659
[chuckles]

18:16.747 --> 18:18.184
Um, where are we going?

18:18.227 --> 18:20.664
- Oh, uh,
thought we'd just sit here.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.318
Talk for a few minutes.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.537
- Oh.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.234
- It's a lot less pressure
than the office.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.758
What I really want is for you
to be relaxed.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.325
Think you can relax?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.761
- Oh, yeah.
Okay.

18:30.805 --> 18:31.806
Yeah, I guess.

18:31.849 --> 18:35.723
Um, what do you want to ask?

18:35.766 --> 18:39.074
- Just a few, uh,
more intimate questions.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.123
How often do you
and Fuad have sex?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.562
- Well...

18:48.605 --> 18:51.347
uh, he's a very passionate man.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.263
- Oh, a very lucky man.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.397
Gets to make love to you
whenever he wants.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.704
Of course, if he doesn't
get his green card

19:00.748 --> 19:02.619
that won't be the case.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.881
- What?

19:05.100 --> 19:08.059
No, no, he can't go home.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.671
You know
his political situation.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.543
- I do.
So...

19:13.587 --> 19:15.197
I have something that you need,

19:15.241 --> 19:17.808
and you have something
that I want.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.375
- What are you asking?

19:22.639 --> 19:27.731
- I want you to make love
to me the way you do to Fuad.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.865
I want you to do it
two or three times.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.650
And then he can
have his green card,

19:33.694 --> 19:36.175
and the two of you can
make love as much as you want

19:36.218 --> 19:38.786
for the rest of your lives.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.614
- You're saying that

19:40.657 --> 19:42.224
I have to sleep with you?

19:42.268 --> 19:44.966
- I'm saying that
I deserve some loving, too.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.750
- Okay, that's all we need.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.752
- Let's give this fool
some love.

19:50.232 --> 19:53.757
- When would we do this?
- Here, now.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.455
Got a mattress in the back.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.893
- NYPD, put your hands
on the wheel.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
- Miss,
you're not in any trouble.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.417
Come with me.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.027
- I'm a federal officer.
I'm on the job.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.464
- Not anymore you're not.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.512
- Rory O'Toole,

20:09.556 --> 20:12.907
you're under arrest
for sexual extortion.

20:21.611 --> 20:21.829
.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.092
- I want to give you
an early out here.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.616
My client is a respected
USCIS investigator.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.532
His job is to uncover scams
for green cards,

20:29.576 --> 20:30.620
which is what he did.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.231
This was a fake marriage.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.754
- Nice try.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.278
O'Toole was extorting sex
in exchange for a green card.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.801
- Please listen to the tape.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.542
Everything I said--
it was a test.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.065
- You had a mattress
in the back seat.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.154
- Well, it has to look real.
That's part of the setup.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.547
- The setup?

20:44.591 --> 20:46.984
We found traces of your DNA
on the mattress.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.551
- It's my mattress.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.292
- Did you find any
of your supposed victim's DNA?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.641
I didn't think so.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.817
He wasn't going
to sexually assault your UC;

20:53.861 --> 20:56.298
he was trying to find out
how far she would go.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.169
- It's like with a narc cop,
right?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.563
You buy the drugs
and then you make the bust.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.086
- Okay, so you were
gonna sleep with her?

21:02.130 --> 21:03.479
- No!

21:03.523 --> 21:05.655
And you don't know that
because your team stepped in

21:05.699 --> 21:07.918
before Mr. O'Toole
had the chance to bust her.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.529
- If the wife is willing

21:09.572 --> 21:13.184
to cross the line to infidelity
for a green card,

21:13.228 --> 21:14.534
how real can the love be?

21:14.577 --> 21:16.884
- Okay, none of this
is DHS protocol,

21:16.927 --> 21:19.190
and I don't see any jurors
buying it for a second.

21:19.234 --> 21:22.019
- You need 12.
I only need one.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.020
Come on.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.720
[thunder rumbles]

21:26.763 --> 21:29.200
- The judge released O'Toole
on his own recognizance.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.028
He claimed that
he knew the marriage was fake,

21:31.072 --> 21:32.682
and he was just trying
to draw her out.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.032
- You'd have a stronger case
with someone he assaulted.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.512
What about his victims?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.209
Can we go back to them
now that he's been arraigned?

21:38.253 --> 21:39.689
- The two victims are terrified

21:39.733 --> 21:41.038
that their husbands
will find out,

21:41.082 --> 21:43.432
and a third
is sitting in ICE detention

21:43.476 --> 21:45.216
afraid that her husband
will be deported.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.348
- Then try them all again.

21:46.392 --> 21:47.523
Three would be great,

21:47.567 --> 21:50.396
but if I have one,
there goes his defense.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.049
- You arrested him?

21:52.093 --> 21:53.834
That's good news.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.358
- The bad news?
He may get away with it.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.403
Unless you--

21:57.446 --> 21:59.796
- Testify?
I'm sorry.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.669
It's just--
it would break Eddie's heart.

22:04.148 --> 22:07.413
- We could compel you
to testify.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.197
- We don't want
to have to do that.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.981
- Rosamie.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.113
- That's Eddie.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.071
He picks me up from work.
He's early.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.290
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.292
- Cops?
Everything all right?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.946
- We were just investigating

22:18.989 --> 22:20.774
some robberies
in the neighborhood.

22:20.817 --> 22:23.429
- Robberies?
You didn't tell me about this.

22:23.472 --> 22:26.257
- I didn't know about them.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.434
I wish I could be more helpful.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.219
- Anything comes to mind, call.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.362
- O'Toole's going to prison?
- If you testify.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.581
- What about my husband,
Patrick?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.583
- O'Toole's under indictment
awaiting trial.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.280
He can't have Patrick deported.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.065
- And I'll get that U visa?

22:51.108 --> 22:54.024
Stay in the U.S.
as long as I want?

22:55.635 --> 22:59.029
Okay, I'm in.
I'll testify.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.162
- We're gonna need
all the exact details.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.990
Dates, places, times.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.992
- O'Toole called me
from a burner.

23:05.035 --> 23:07.168
- So that would be
on your cell phone?

23:07.211 --> 23:08.952
- Uh, they don't let me
have that here.

23:08.996 --> 23:12.391
- What about Patrick?
Does he have it?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.915
- Do you have
to go through him?

23:14.958 --> 23:16.960
I never told him about this.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.833
- He doesn't have to know why.
Not yet.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.492
[doorbell chimes]

23:29.059 --> 23:30.017
- Oh.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.542
Can I help you?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.283
- We're looking
for Patrick Quigley.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.458
- Maggie Quigley's husband.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.156
- Aye.
Honey, is that the take-out?

23:39.200 --> 23:42.464
Oh, sorry.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
- This, um--
[chuckles]

23:44.510 --> 23:46.599
it isn't what it looks like.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.514
- Never is.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.952
- I know O'Toole had been
arrested, but now my husband--

23:51.995 --> 23:54.084
he's asking me non-stop
if I cheated on him.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.522
- Lina, you didn't
do anything wrong.

23:56.565 --> 23:57.958
You were assaulted.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.916
- Yeah, but I swore to him
nothing happened.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.050
- If we tell him
that you weren't the only one,

24:03.093 --> 24:06.836
that you and the other women
were forced, you had to--

24:06.880 --> 24:08.490
- But even
if he does believe me

24:08.534 --> 24:10.492
he's always
gonna be thinking about it.

24:10.536 --> 24:14.017
I have to get everything ready
for Sebastian and Mavis

24:14.061 --> 24:15.323
before their mother comes home.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.456
- Would it help if--
if I talked to him with you?

24:17.499 --> 24:18.761
- No.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.328
He's already going crazy
with jealousy.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.069
He's checking my text message,
he's following me around--

24:22.112 --> 24:23.853
- You sound like
you're afraid of him.

24:26.029 --> 24:26.987
Lina...

24:28.641 --> 24:30.730
Did he do this to you?

24:33.123 --> 24:34.690
Okay, listen to me.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.171
There's another option, okay?

24:37.214 --> 24:40.914
You don't have
to stay married to Joe.

24:40.957 --> 24:45.919
You were the victim of a crime
and we can get you a U visa.

24:51.881 --> 24:55.711
- So if I leave him,
I can stay in this country?

24:55.755 --> 25:00.803
- Yes,
if you testify against O'Toole.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.413
- But my husband's a good man.

25:02.457 --> 25:05.329
[stutters] But he already
doesn't believe me.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.945
I can't live like this anymore.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.775
I'll testify.

25:22.738 --> 25:23.130
.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.219
- Rosamie Klein
still won't testify?

25:25.262 --> 25:26.699
- She doesn't want
to hurt her husband.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.831
- And it turns out Maggie
Quigley's marriage was a fake.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.659
Her husband's gay
and she is, too.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.400
- So they lied about
their green card,

25:32.443 --> 25:34.620
which is itself
a federal offense.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.360
There's already a lot
of blowback.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.188
If this case implodes--

25:38.232 --> 25:39.538
where's Hadid on this?

25:39.581 --> 25:42.758
- She's not shying away
from the fight.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.238
O'Toole's attorney, Buchanan,

25:44.281 --> 25:46.153
already approached us
with a slap-on-the-wrist deal

25:46.196 --> 25:47.763
for misdemeanor
official misconduct.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.025
Hadid said no way.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.200
- Well, what does she want
to charge him with?

25:50.244 --> 25:52.202
- At a minimum, rape three.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.552
Plus felony charges

25:53.595 --> 25:55.510
of official misconduct
and receiving a bribe.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.904
- I would argue that
threatening to deport victims

25:57.947 --> 26:00.297
to countries
where they face violence

26:00.341 --> 26:02.169
constitutes
forcible compulsion.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.518
- That's rape one.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.259
- That makes the case
much harder.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.304
And Hadid wants O'Toole
to go down for this.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.045
- And if he doesn't, you do?

26:09.089 --> 26:10.438
- Probably.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.527
I mean, I can add on
misdemeanor sexual misconduct,

26:12.571 --> 26:13.659
coercion, official misconduct.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.878
- He deserves no less
than 15 years.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.314
- Throw the whole book at him.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.360
- I'm trying, but I don't have
textbook witnesses.

26:19.403 --> 26:22.711
I got Duane, the subway groper.
Rollins and Hasim.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.539
Buchanan's already salivating
about his cross.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.714
- And Lina.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.890
She's credible,
she has no reason to lie,

26:27.934 --> 26:29.239
and everything to lose.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.763
- Just make sure she shows up.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.246
- And all the immigrant women

26:36.290 --> 26:37.987
Mr. O'Toole requested
that I send him

26:38.031 --> 26:40.947
were young, attractive,
diverse, and desperate.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.427
- Desperate.
How?

26:43.471 --> 26:45.691
- They fled gangs,
war, poverty.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.127
They were terrified
of being sent back.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.346
- So terrified
of being deported

26:49.390 --> 26:51.392
that they gave in to
Mr. O'Toole's sexual demands?

26:51.435 --> 26:53.133
- Objection.
Calls for speculation.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.483
- Withdrawn.
Mr. Varick, is there a reason

26:55.526 --> 26:57.833
that your boss pulled
these particular women's files?

26:57.877 --> 27:01.358
- Yes, he called it
his Baskin-Robbins file.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.100
One in every flavor.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.928
- Nothing further.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.408
- Mr. Varick,

27:07.451 --> 27:09.715
you made a deal with the
prosecution to testify today?

27:09.758 --> 27:11.107
- Your Honor,

27:11.151 --> 27:12.239
the jury already heard this
on Mr. Varick's direct--

27:12.282 --> 27:13.414
- Yes, that's right.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.198
You were charged
with forcible touching

27:15.242 --> 27:18.288
and unlawful
sexual surveillance.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.074
That's upskirting, isn't it?

27:21.117 --> 27:22.945
Good thing I wore pants today.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.991
- Move along, Mr. Buchanan.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.296
- After you were arrested,

27:26.340 --> 27:28.864
the detectives found
your upskirting files

27:28.908 --> 27:29.778
on your work computer?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.301
- Yes.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.652
- Who gave them access?
- My supervisor, Mr. O'Toole.

27:33.695 --> 27:37.046
- And that's when you decided
to play "Let's Make A Deal"?

27:37.090 --> 27:39.614
- Objection.
- I'll rephrase.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.137
According
to your own testimony,

27:41.181 --> 27:43.487
you were aware of this
egregious behavior for years,

27:43.531 --> 27:45.315
but you never reported it,

27:45.359 --> 27:47.013
never said a word about it
to anyone?

27:47.056 --> 27:48.231
- I'm not proud of that.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.668
- [chuckles]

27:49.711 --> 27:52.714
You have a lot
not to be proud of, Mr. Varick.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.325
Enough to make up charges
like this to save your own ass?

27:55.369 --> 27:57.937
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.895
Nothing further.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.855
- Detective Rollins and I

28:02.898 --> 28:06.380
posed as a mixed-ethnicity,
interreligious couple.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.991
We were hoping to draw
Mr. O'Toole's attention,

28:09.035 --> 28:10.340
which we did.

28:10.384 --> 28:11.951
- Did he do
follow-up interviews?

28:11.994 --> 28:16.520
- Not with me, but he asked for
a private, nighttime meeting

28:16.564 --> 28:19.698
with Detective Rollins
in his minivan.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.570
- Thank you, Sergeant Khaldun.

28:22.613 --> 28:26.922
- So you lied
to a fellow officer

28:26.966 --> 28:30.186
about your religion,

28:30.230 --> 28:35.191
your marriage, your job, about
every detail of your life?

28:35.235 --> 28:37.280
- It was
an undercover operation.

28:37.324 --> 28:40.457
- In other words,
it was a fake marriage.

28:40.501 --> 28:43.330
And my client figured it out.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.724
- I believe he thought
our marriage was real,

28:45.767 --> 28:48.204
but the red flags it raised
gave him leverage

28:48.248 --> 28:50.380
to sexually extort
Detective Rollins.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.643
- [scoffs]
You mean your fake wife.

28:52.687 --> 28:56.038
So your testimony is that
you're a good enough liar

28:56.082 --> 28:59.302
to fool a trained investigator
with 20 years' experience?

28:59.346 --> 29:01.522
- You could put it that way.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.393
- How about a jury?
- Objection.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.744
- Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.967
- Mr. O'Toole told me

29:12.011 --> 29:16.102
I had to meet him in private
in his minivan.

29:16.145 --> 29:17.233
And as you heard on the tape,

29:17.277 --> 29:18.713
he said
if I wanted the green card

29:18.757 --> 29:20.149
then I had to have sex
with him.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.238
- And what were
his exact words?

29:22.282 --> 29:24.153
- That he deserved
some loving, too.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.808
- Thank you, detective.

29:26.852 --> 29:30.333
- But you didn't have sex
with my client, did you?

29:30.377 --> 29:31.770
- No.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.859
- He never assaulted you
in any way?

29:33.902 --> 29:36.122
- No, but his intent
was clear and graphic.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.732
He said we needed to go
to the back of the van

29:37.776 --> 29:38.994
where there was a mattress.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.996
- And did you go
to the back of the van?

29:41.040 --> 29:43.172
- No, my support team
pulled open the doors

29:43.216 --> 29:44.434
before that could happen.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.784
- So isn't it possible
he was testing you

29:45.827 --> 29:49.091
to see if you were really
a faithful wife?

29:49.135 --> 29:50.919
- Please.
That was not what was going on.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.575
- You were playing a role.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.534
Isn't it possible that
he was playing one, too?
