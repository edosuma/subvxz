00:00.009 --> 00:01.609
Previously on Scream Queens...

00:01.664 --> 00:03.155
I'm afraid you have kuru.

00:03.180 --> 00:04.469
No one must know.

00:04.501 --> 00:05.633
If the board finds out,

00:05.670 --> 00:07.437
[over headphones]: they'll think
I'm unfit to run the hospital.

00:07.505 --> 00:10.107
HESTER: <i>Massacres tend to
happen in this hospital</i>

00:10.174 --> 00:11.208
<i>on Halloween night.</i>

00:11.275 --> 00:13.475
You tried to kill me with punch?!

00:13.500 --> 00:16.413
- Bitch, just as soon as I get...
- [electricity crackles]

00:16.481 --> 00:18.593
CHANEL #5: Help!

00:23.359 --> 00:25.527
I could've swore I
heard Chanel #5 scream.

00:25.588 --> 00:27.923
How did you hear her
from across the hospital?

00:27.990 --> 00:29.305
[scream in distance]

00:29.330 --> 00:30.549
She's drawn to Chanel #5's pain

00:30.593 --> 00:32.734
like a shark to blood in the water.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.130
She's developed a
fine-tuned addiction to it.

00:35.198 --> 00:36.364
[all gasp]

00:36.432 --> 00:38.767
[groaning weakly]

00:39.386 --> 00:41.954
Come on. Help me. Help me.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.850
- She's dead.
- [gasps]

00:49.875 --> 00:51.601
ZAYDAY: Oh, God, that's horrible.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.248
Um, guys,

00:53.316 --> 00:54.687
passing out...

00:54.712 --> 00:57.219
If the killer can take out
a special agent of the FBI,

00:57.286 --> 00:58.531
are any of us safe?

00:58.547 --> 01:00.993
The miracle is this
didn't hit a vital organ.

01:01.018 --> 01:03.251
Oh, my God, I'm passing out.

01:03.318 --> 01:06.428
For the love of God,
Number Five, Denise is dead!

01:06.453 --> 01:09.829
Can you maybe let us all have
two minutes that isn't about you?

01:10.361 --> 01:12.896
We have to take this body
and throw her in the swamp.

01:12.964 --> 01:14.275
What?!

01:14.300 --> 01:15.874
We can't just dump her in the swamp!

01:15.899 --> 01:17.421
Denise was our friend!

01:17.446 --> 01:20.023
MUNSCH: I loved Denise as
much as the rest of you,

01:20.048 --> 01:21.931
which, admittedly, wasn't that much.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.607
We just can't let her death have a...

01:23.674 --> 01:26.821
negative impact on the
work being done here.

01:26.852 --> 01:30.657
I mean, if word got out that
a FBI agent was killed here,

01:30.682 --> 01:32.585
they would just shut us down!

01:32.610 --> 01:34.524
And that means no patients.

01:34.549 --> 01:39.222
And the life-saving research
that we are doing here would end.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.813
And we can't have that...

01:41.838 --> 01:44.027
can we, Zayday?!

01:44.095 --> 01:46.595
Even if I wanted to
dump her in the swamp,

01:46.626 --> 01:48.577
don't you think the Feds are
gonna come looking for her?

01:48.602 --> 01:52.062
But then I will tell whomever comes

01:52.087 --> 01:54.062
that Denise just took off

01:54.087 --> 01:56.484
on a secret mission for some...

01:56.509 --> 01:58.909
top secret shadow

01:58.976 --> 02:01.509
organization within the FBI.

02:01.534 --> 02:03.647
Now, somebody get me a gurney.

02:03.714 --> 02:07.423
Because Special Agent Denise
Hemphill's going for a little swim.

02:07.477 --> 02:09.886
[men screaming in distance]

02:10.345 --> 02:12.704
CHANEL #5: Uh, guys? Guys?

02:13.649 --> 02:14.824
Wait, really?

02:14.892 --> 02:16.026
Guys! [groans]

02:18.491 --> 02:20.157
[creaking]

02:22.567 --> 02:24.668
ZAYDAY: Oh, my God.

02:24.931 --> 02:26.469
Who could have done this?

02:26.537 --> 02:29.087
We just need to find the
guy dressed as Aaron Burr.

02:29.112 --> 02:31.359
It's gonna be pretty hard to
cover this up, Dean Munsch.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.711
Girls... we have no choice,
I have to call the authorities.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.013
Go change out of your costumes.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.179
No. Zayday.

02:39.204 --> 02:41.876
I need you to help with something first.

02:41.901 --> 02:43.853
Come with me.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.728
Remind me when we're done here,

02:47.760 --> 02:50.427
I must send someone up
to help poor Chanel #5.

02:50.494 --> 02:53.730
I told you, I'm not dumping
Denise's body in the swamp.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.565
Well, of course not.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.068
- She's still alive.
- What?

02:58.093 --> 03:00.517
- When did you know she was alive?
- When I took her pulse.

03:00.542 --> 03:01.993
She had the faintest heartbeat.

03:02.018 --> 03:04.171
I mean not enough to
resuscitate her, of course.

03:04.196 --> 03:05.709
She's basically brain-dead.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.533
And you were still gonna
throw her in the swamp?

03:07.558 --> 03:09.126
No, no, no. That isn't an option.

03:09.151 --> 03:12.455
What, with the kind of massacre
that just occurred upstairs,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.478
I can't be sure that
they're not gonna dredge

03:14.503 --> 03:17.077
or even drain the swamp
during their investigation.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.884
But rest assured, Denise
did not die in vain.

03:19.917 --> 03:21.681
She's going to be an integral part

03:21.706 --> 03:24.742
of our little "save my
life" research project.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.863
Come, see-see it.

03:26.931 --> 03:28.431
[panting]: This...

03:28.456 --> 03:30.431
is the secret cryogenic chamber

03:30.456 --> 03:33.737
I had built with just a small
portion of the Radwell fortune.

03:33.762 --> 03:36.421
We're gonna put Denise in
here and give this baby...

03:36.446 --> 03:38.642
a little test drive just
to make sure it works,

03:38.667 --> 03:41.140
just in case my condition proves fatal

03:41.165 --> 03:42.746
before we can find a cure.

03:42.813 --> 03:44.392
This doesn't feel right.

03:44.417 --> 03:47.274
Well... we could just
take Denise upstairs

03:47.299 --> 03:48.783
and hook her up to a feeding tube

03:48.815 --> 03:51.288
and watch her as she
slowly deteriorates.

03:51.355 --> 03:54.958
Or we can put Denise
in here, in the freezer,

03:55.026 --> 03:57.602
until they find a cure
for being electrocuted.

04:05.596 --> 04:07.330
[squeaking]

04:08.439 --> 04:10.907
[mechanical whirring]

04:12.643 --> 04:14.016
[panting]

04:14.632 --> 04:15.832
Zayday.

04:16.846 --> 04:18.148
It's getting worse.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.529
Please, Zayday, help me.

04:20.553 --> 04:23.756
I don't want to end up
in that tank like Denise.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.358
[mechanical whirring growing louder]

04:30.751 --> 04:34.086
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

04:34.750 --> 04:36.007
It worked.

04:36.032 --> 04:37.533
I peed out all the blue.

04:37.599 --> 04:39.534
My butt is still really blue, though,

04:39.601 --> 04:41.626
so I kind of look like a blonde baboon.

04:41.651 --> 04:42.688
Mm.

04:42.713 --> 04:44.945
I gave you a healthy
dosage of deferasirox.

04:44.970 --> 04:48.507
It's a chelation solution
that sort of leeches out the...

04:48.538 --> 04:51.445
heavy metals in the organs,
and especially the skin,

04:51.470 --> 04:53.265
and helps you pee 'em out.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.827
- [chuckles]
- Now, if you've noticed some...

04:54.852 --> 04:57.701
silver in the fleshy part
of your butt, it'll...

04:57.726 --> 04:59.749
it'll normalize soon, I promise.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.077
I'm sorry about the,
uh, silver poisoning.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.718
I mean, I have no idea who did that.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.850
I mean, someone must have
messed with my solution.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.509
Could have been anyone, really.

05:08.534 --> 05:09.812
They're all jealous of you.

05:09.837 --> 05:12.201
It was probably Dean BoxMunsch.

05:12.226 --> 05:14.523
I mean, she wanted to make
sure her and her gray pubes

05:14.548 --> 05:16.140
had you all to herself.

05:16.165 --> 05:19.445
Well, first of all, she's
rockin' a full Kojak down there.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.149
And second, I really appreciate
that everyone's rooting

05:22.174 --> 05:23.640
for me and her to be
the new power couple.

05:23.665 --> 05:27.313
And third, the sex was exquisite.

05:27.477 --> 05:30.493
I mean, the best I've had since I
spent the weekend with Sean Young

05:30.525 --> 05:33.179
- [groans]
- right when she started her crazy phase.

05:33.258 --> 05:35.368
Look, the only reason
why I got busy with Munsch

05:35.393 --> 05:38.516
is because I was bummed out
that I lost the chance with you.

05:39.367 --> 05:40.644
I don't know.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.329
I mean, you guys are
more age-appropriate.

05:43.396 --> 05:45.664
You do realize you were, like,
30 when I was born, right?

05:45.689 --> 05:46.876
[elevator bell dings]

05:47.467 --> 05:50.835
Besides, I don't know if I can love
anyone after what happened with Chad.

05:50.860 --> 05:53.205
I mean... I need time.

05:53.273 --> 05:54.914
Take all you need.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.368
- Not really.
- [laughs]

05:56.393 --> 05:58.071
I probably only need a couple hours.

05:58.096 --> 06:01.735
I have, like, zero
emotional object permanence.

06:06.178 --> 06:07.755
MUNSCH: <i>It had finally happened.</i>

06:07.780 --> 06:09.888
<i>The sword of Damocles had fallen.</i>

06:09.956 --> 06:11.358
[camera shutter clicking]

06:13.147 --> 06:14.835
<i>I finally knew what it felt like</i>

06:14.860 --> 06:16.264
<i>- to be Freddy Krueger.</i>
- [camera shutter clicking]

06:17.163 --> 06:21.448
<i>Because I, Cathy Munsch, was
walking through a nightmare.</i>

06:21.473 --> 06:23.651
WOMAN: Dr. Munsch, what do you
have to say about these murders?

06:23.676 --> 06:26.840
MUNSCH: <i>I knew in that moment
my dream had been shattered.</i>

06:26.865 --> 06:29.799
<i>The C.U.R.E. Institute was dead,</i>

06:29.824 --> 06:32.025
<i>and I wasn't far behind.</i>

06:38.549 --> 06:42.970
<i>But one week later, something
equally unexpected happened.</i>

06:43.141 --> 06:45.709
<i>The hospital was thriving.</i>

06:46.064 --> 06:49.267
<i>As it turns out, the
old adage is true...</i>

06:49.283 --> 06:52.166
<i>there is no such thing as bad press.</i>

06:52.191 --> 06:53.892
<i>News reports of the murders</i>

06:53.917 --> 06:56.986
<i>gave us hundreds of
hours of free publicity.</i>

06:57.011 --> 07:00.024
<i>And medical anomalies
from all across the world</i>

07:00.049 --> 07:02.227
<i>started coming out of the woodwork.</i>

07:02.252 --> 07:05.787
<i>And they weren't worried about being
knocked off by a serial killer.</i>

07:05.812 --> 07:07.642
<i>Any risk was worth the miracle</i>

07:07.667 --> 07:11.793
<i>of maybe having their horrible
physical fates reversed.</i>

07:12.361 --> 07:14.970
- Excuse me, Dean Munsch.
- [groans] Yes.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.463
What, with the current
influx of patients...

07:16.488 --> 07:17.533
MUNSCH: This bitch...

07:17.558 --> 07:19.987
<i>I hired Nurse Hoffel to
make my job easier...</i>

07:20.012 --> 07:21.806
<i>i.e. showing me how to run a hospital...</i>

07:21.831 --> 07:25.492
<i>and now, this pill-popping battle
axe thinks she's invaluable.</i>

07:25.517 --> 07:29.213
An expenditure like that should really
be run past the board of directors.

07:29.611 --> 07:31.235
I'll look into it.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.510
<i>The good news is that we were busy.</i>

07:33.642 --> 07:35.508
<i>So many patients to meet.</i>

07:35.533 --> 07:37.853
Well, my name's Marguerite Honeywell.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.078
I suffer from Marfan Syndrome.

07:40.103 --> 07:43.149
Wow. That name is really
kind of a mouthful.

07:43.174 --> 07:44.697
Do you mind if I called you "Marfan"?

07:44.722 --> 07:47.852
Um... yes, actually, I would.

07:47.877 --> 07:48.997
MUNSCH: <i>Now, Daria,</i>

07:49.022 --> 07:50.541
it says here that you were diagnosed

07:50.566 --> 07:53.139
with Moebius Syndrome in 2013.

07:53.164 --> 07:55.140
- Is that right?
- That's right.

07:55.165 --> 07:57.304
I do online beauty tutorials,

07:57.329 --> 08:00.809
and my total inability to
move any part of my face

08:00.877 --> 08:04.412
is really getting savaged
in the comments section.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.765
MUNSCH: <i>But there was one
case that really intrigued me.</i>

08:08.289 --> 08:11.453
WOMAN [British accent]: I must say that
coming here today was not my decision,

08:11.521 --> 08:13.822
but rather that of my
employers at the United Nations.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.490
Wait. You work at the United Nations?

08:15.558 --> 08:17.560
That's really cool. I've
always wanted to go there.

08:17.585 --> 08:20.662
[Swedish accent]: I worked in the
diplomatic corps as an interpreter

08:20.687 --> 08:22.697
for close to 20 years now.

08:22.765 --> 08:24.633
And I'm the model of perfect health,

08:24.700 --> 08:26.734
so I have no idea why I'm even here.

08:26.759 --> 08:27.969
CHANEL: Wait. I'm
sorry. Are you Swedish?

08:27.994 --> 08:29.814
- I thought you were from the U.K.
- No.

08:29.839 --> 08:31.851
[French accent]: I'm
from Minnesota originally.

08:31.876 --> 08:33.875
Maybe that's what you are picking up on.

08:33.943 --> 08:37.265
My husband says I sound like I'm
straight out of the movie <i>Fargo.</i>

08:37.491 --> 08:40.708
MUNSCH: Wow. Inability
to land a single accent.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.078
It's fascinating.

08:42.102 --> 08:45.412
[Australian accent]: Now, I did
slip and fall a few weeks ago,

08:45.437 --> 08:47.803
and I was taken to hospital,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.424
but they said it was
just a mild concussion,

08:49.449 --> 08:51.287
and I was released that afternoon.

08:51.312 --> 08:52.861
When-when you're talking,

08:52.929 --> 08:56.601
are you aware of the way
you talk sort of... shifting?

08:56.626 --> 08:58.700
[with Russian accent]:
I speak the way I speak.

08:58.768 --> 09:00.502
I don't know what you are getting at.

09:00.570 --> 09:01.703
Can I just say...

09:01.728 --> 09:03.705
I think it's fascinating that
she's doing all these accents,

09:03.730 --> 09:06.068
but she hasn't done one that
anyone could deem offensive.

09:06.093 --> 09:08.835
[with Indian accent]: Accent? Why does
everybody keep bringing up my accent?

09:08.860 --> 09:10.959
I told you, I am from the Midwest.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.213
Okay. Never mind.

09:12.281 --> 09:15.834
Ms. Hotchkiss, I am
afraid at this point,

09:15.859 --> 09:18.562
we do not know what it is
you may have or not have,

09:18.587 --> 09:22.217
nor if there is a treatment
or a cure, but rest assured,

09:22.242 --> 09:25.727
with all the resources available
here at the C.U.R.E. Institute,

09:25.795 --> 09:29.171
we will not stop until we find one.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.803
Right, team?

09:34.835 --> 09:37.739
Hey, this can't be the most
sanitary way to clean bedpans.

09:37.807 --> 09:41.257
I mean, aren't there rules
and... laws and stuff?

09:42.328 --> 09:44.725
A few weeks ago, I was in charge
of giving fentanyl to a patient,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.326
who, based on Zayday's recommendation,
was about to get a lobotomy.

09:47.351 --> 09:48.773
Also, we dumped a body in the swamp,

09:48.798 --> 09:50.919
so I don't really think rules
are a priority around here.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.121
Hello, non-doctor idiots.

09:53.189 --> 09:56.438
I'm sorry to interrupt your
hard work cleaning bedpans...

09:56.463 --> 09:59.968
the only thing you're qualified at
any other hospital on Planet Earth.

10:00.093 --> 10:02.375
You... Dead Inside...

10:02.400 --> 10:05.631
I need you to rinse and
sanitize these catheter tubes.

10:05.656 --> 10:06.968
Oh, careful.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.039
Some of 'em are still sort of juicy.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.842
And I'm gonna need you to
strain these fecal samples,

10:13.909 --> 10:15.777
place them in saline solution,

10:15.845 --> 10:18.480
and then load them in
enemas for fecal transplant.

10:18.547 --> 10:20.959
Ew! No, I'm not doing that!

10:20.984 --> 10:22.851
Sorry, Dr. Tiny Bitch,

10:22.918 --> 10:25.351
but Crohn's disease
isn't gonna cure itself.

10:25.523 --> 10:26.855
[gasps]

10:26.922 --> 10:29.492
Why are you wearing
sunglasses? Are you hung over?

10:32.984 --> 10:34.829
Pethidine doesn't give you a hangover.

10:34.854 --> 10:36.389
That's why I love it so much.

10:36.414 --> 10:39.562
But it's great to manage moderate
to severe pains in the ass

10:39.587 --> 10:42.367
who don't belong within
ten miles of a hospital.

10:43.421 --> 10:47.131
Oh. I also need you
to get a semen sample

10:47.156 --> 10:50.412
from the guy in the coma in room 1219.

10:50.479 --> 10:52.881
His ex-wife's just
dying to pull the plug.

10:52.948 --> 10:55.016
She's claiming their kid isn't his.

10:55.084 --> 10:57.185
How am I supposed to get his semen?

10:58.382 --> 11:00.484
[whispering]: I think you know.

11:00.731 --> 11:03.109
[chuckles] Catch you later, bitches.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.523
[Chanel grunts]

11:08.381 --> 11:11.489
CHANEL: That is it! I am not
cleaning one more pooey bedpan.

11:11.514 --> 11:12.935
Number Three, finish
cleaning all of these,

11:12.960 --> 11:15.022
and then, bring me a latte
and a scone at the Korean spa.

11:15.054 --> 11:17.458
I am getting a manicure
and a vag steaming.

11:17.483 --> 11:18.670
No way.

11:18.695 --> 11:21.913
If anyone's vag is getting
steamed, it's my vag.

11:21.938 --> 11:23.872
[crying]: This is all just so wrong.

11:23.897 --> 11:27.537
I mean, an Oberlin hasn't
worked in over 300 years.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.811
We have been genetically
perfected over centuries

11:29.836 --> 11:32.571
of ordering people around
to be good at only one thing.

11:32.639 --> 11:34.818
Ordering people around.

11:36.435 --> 11:37.535
That's it.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.528
The reason we have lost
the will to live is because

11:39.553 --> 11:41.991
what's the point of living if we
don't have people to boss around?

11:42.016 --> 11:44.683
Who are we if we don't
have pledges to torture

11:44.751 --> 11:46.252
and make do stuff for us?

11:46.319 --> 11:47.943
How are we supposed to recruit pledges?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.467
We're not in a sorority anymore.

11:49.956 --> 11:53.223
This hospital is suddenly
full of gross, sick people.

11:53.248 --> 11:56.856
I mean, way too many for the
limited staff we have now.

11:56.935 --> 11:58.879
Dean Munsch and Nurse Hoffel
need to hire more people,

11:58.904 --> 12:00.428
so we're gonna do it for them.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.100
We'll train them to be Chanels

12:02.125 --> 12:03.927
and make them our minions.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.303
I mean, if I learned anything

12:05.328 --> 12:07.396
from surviving the last serial
killer who tried to kill us,

12:07.421 --> 12:09.420
it's that you always need
a group of less attractive,

12:09.445 --> 12:11.677
less popular, less
interesting people around

12:11.745 --> 12:13.245
for the killer to kill before you.

12:13.313 --> 12:16.081
Okay, that is genius.

12:16.149 --> 12:18.571
Which is why I'm the
brains of this operation.

12:18.596 --> 12:19.761
Now let's hit the spa.

12:19.786 --> 12:21.455
These bedpans can wait until we find

12:21.480 --> 12:23.557
less attractive people
around to clean them.

12:23.582 --> 12:26.025
- [knocking]
- Yes!

12:29.010 --> 12:31.408
Dean Munsch, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.478
Mm-hmm. What is it?

12:33.533 --> 12:34.698
It's Chamberlain.

12:34.723 --> 12:37.879
I have my suspicions that he's
the baby in the belly from 1985,

12:37.934 --> 12:39.463
and it's driving me crazy.

12:39.488 --> 12:41.633
'cause I need to find out
how you found him and...

12:41.658 --> 12:42.932
what his interview was like?

12:42.957 --> 12:44.100
Who's Chamberlain?

12:44.144 --> 12:46.739
Chamberlain, the candy striper
you hired from your Craigslist ad?

12:46.764 --> 12:48.323
We don't have a candy striper.

12:48.348 --> 12:51.116
And I would never take
an ad out on Craigslist.

12:51.184 --> 12:54.067
That's where married men score
meth and hook up with each other.

12:54.092 --> 12:56.425
So wait. You're saying
you didn't hire him?

12:56.450 --> 12:59.792
Big guy, African-American,
loveable, a bit of a stalker?

12:59.859 --> 13:01.332
Oh, that guy.

13:01.357 --> 13:04.096
I thought he was Dr.
Brock Holt's assistant.

13:04.164 --> 13:07.418
Dr. Holt doesn't have an assistant.

13:08.418 --> 13:10.323
I mean, now he's my prime suspect.

13:10.348 --> 13:11.937
Oh, you think?

13:12.005 --> 13:14.306
An adult man wanders into a hospital

13:14.374 --> 13:17.659
and pretends to have a
weird volunteer position...

13:17.684 --> 13:20.840
that's almost exclusively
reserved for young girls?

13:20.918 --> 13:23.175
It might not even be a thing anymore.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.927
You think...

13:24.952 --> 13:27.472
that he might have something to do...

13:27.497 --> 13:28.620
with mass murder?

13:28.645 --> 13:30.988
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.426
If we're gonna find
out who that baby is,

13:32.451 --> 13:34.574
we're gonna need to
find the mother first.

13:35.128 --> 13:37.062
[sighs]

13:38.676 --> 13:40.131
[door closes, door opens]

13:43.036 --> 13:47.303
Come on, Mama, let's
find out where you are.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.746
[thudding]

13:53.813 --> 13:55.278
- Hello?
- WOMAN: [groans]

13:55.303 --> 13:57.016
Help me.

14:00.803 --> 14:02.249
Oh, my gosh!

14:02.335 --> 14:04.957
Chanel #5, what happened?

14:05.025 --> 14:09.208
Well, I was just trying to get up
to get a teaspoon of mayonnaise,

14:09.233 --> 14:11.130
and then, I tripped,
and I couldn't get up.

14:11.155 --> 14:14.633
What are you even doing here?
You should be in the hospital.

14:15.383 --> 14:18.070
Yes, I should be in the hospital!

14:18.138 --> 14:22.562
I-I just had a machete thrust
nine inches into my thorax,

14:22.593 --> 14:25.389
breaking three ribs,
puncturing my left lung

14:25.414 --> 14:27.537
and entirely severing
my right trapezoidal.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.344
- I should be in the ICU.
- That's where I thought you were.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.651
Oh, I was, until Chanel
wheeled me in here.

14:32.719 --> 14:35.930
But then she told me it was just
that I was more convenient to insult.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.928
In the meantime, no one is taking care

14:37.953 --> 14:40.526
of my actual life-threatening injury!

14:40.593 --> 14:44.898
I have received exactly
zero Edible Arrangements.

14:44.923 --> 14:48.133
Well, listen, I will be
happy to take care of you.

14:48.445 --> 14:50.769
And in return, I could
really use your help.

14:50.837 --> 14:52.367
[scoffs] Help with what?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.623
We're gonna find the mother
who was pregnant in the hospital

14:54.648 --> 14:56.672
on Halloween in 1985.

14:56.697 --> 14:58.375
I'm thinking we can head
down to the police station

14:58.400 --> 15:00.045
and try to access the archives.

15:00.113 --> 15:02.711
I mean, if her husband went missing,
she would have filed a report, right?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.859
I don't know. I mean, I
don't really think in a way

15:04.884 --> 15:07.226
- ... that is helpful to anyone.
- Just come on!

15:08.958 --> 15:10.633
[groaning]

15:18.028 --> 15:19.840
I need an update Number Three.

15:19.872 --> 15:21.403
Any responses?

15:21.428 --> 15:23.590
What about the Chanel wait list?

15:24.106 --> 15:26.825
No responses, and everyone on
the Chanel wait list passed.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.044
What is happening?!

15:28.069 --> 15:30.302
Two years ago, if I
had posted on my socials

15:30.327 --> 15:33.598
that we were accepting
applications for new Chanels,

15:33.623 --> 15:37.498
we'd have throngs of skinny, rich
bitches banging down our door!

15:37.566 --> 15:41.276
I just don't understand why
we even need any more Chanels.

15:41.301 --> 15:44.409
I told you, cow. We need cannon fodder.

15:44.434 --> 15:46.660
We need new Chanels for
the Green Meanie to attack

15:46.685 --> 15:47.632
so he doesn't murder us!

15:47.676 --> 15:50.003
Uh, you already have that, Chanel.

15:50.028 --> 15:51.412
Her name is... me!

15:51.480 --> 15:53.614
The Green Meanie's already
tried to murder me twice.

15:53.682 --> 15:56.195
Yeah, and pretty soon, he's
probably going to succeed,

15:56.220 --> 15:58.566
and then where will we be, Number Five?

15:58.848 --> 16:01.379
It's time to start
taking desperate measures.

16:01.778 --> 16:03.624
We need to start interviewing patients.

16:03.649 --> 16:05.762
Why do you think you'd
make a good Chanel?

16:05.787 --> 16:07.801
Um, I don't, actually.

16:07.826 --> 16:10.064
I don't really know what
you're talking about.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.918
You said you had some important
information about my condition.

16:12.943 --> 16:15.020
No, I do have very
important information.

16:15.045 --> 16:16.526
Your condition is about to improve

16:16.551 --> 16:18.872
by potentially becoming a Chanel.

16:18.897 --> 16:20.331
I don't understand.

16:20.356 --> 16:21.842
What's a Chanel?

16:21.910 --> 16:24.270
Duh. Us. We're Chanels.

16:24.295 --> 16:26.056
You like money, right?
And telling it like it is?

16:26.081 --> 16:27.418
Yeah, I guess.

16:27.443 --> 16:29.283
It's done. Congratulations.

16:29.351 --> 16:31.027
You're a Chanel.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.238
How long would it take
you to run a full sprint?

16:33.270 --> 16:34.378
I'm sorry?

16:34.403 --> 16:36.447
Like if a grown man was
chasing you with a big stick

16:36.472 --> 16:38.019
that's shaped like a knife
but made out of metal?

16:38.044 --> 16:39.621
So, a knife?

16:39.646 --> 16:41.251
Yeah. Do you think you could outrun him?

16:41.296 --> 16:43.964
- Probably not.
- Congratulations.

16:43.989 --> 16:45.628
You're a Chanel.

16:47.168 --> 16:48.969
Let's go find the next potential Chanel.

16:48.994 --> 16:50.168
There aren't anymore. That's it.

16:50.193 --> 16:52.089
- Those were all the patients.
- What?!

16:52.253 --> 16:54.035
Damn it, Number Three! We
need at least one more Chanel

16:54.060 --> 16:56.089
to double our chances of survival!

16:56.121 --> 16:57.121
[sighs]

16:57.222 --> 16:58.533
We're gonna have to do the unthinkable.

16:58.558 --> 16:59.807
No, not him.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.550
Look, I don't like it any
more than you do, Number Three.

17:01.575 --> 17:03.697
- [sighs]
- We're gonna have to call Tristan.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.086
<i>We first learned about Tristan</i>

17:05.111 --> 17:07.627
<i>when we were appealing
our murder conviction.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:10.571
<i>Some psycho was writing
these handwritten novels</i>

17:10.597 --> 17:12.167
<i>where all the Chanels were lesbians,</i>

17:12.193 --> 17:14.542
<i>and all we did was have
sex with each other.</i>

17:15.557 --> 17:17.152
This is for you.

17:22.246 --> 17:25.214
<i>"Hey, Chanel. My name's
Tristan St. Pierre,</i>

17:25.239 --> 17:27.118
<i>"and I'm your biggest fan.</i>

17:27.144 --> 17:28.619
<i>"I heard about your murder trial,</i>

17:28.644 --> 17:32.163
<i>"so I thought I'd send you
some of my Chanel fan fiction.</i>

17:32.188 --> 17:33.753
<i>"Enjoy!"</i>

17:33.985 --> 17:35.583
CHANEL: <i>I didn't think twice about it,</i>

17:35.650 --> 17:38.102
<i>and then, three weeks later...</i>

17:38.476 --> 17:39.843
- [phone chimes]
- "Hey Chanel!

17:39.855 --> 17:40.923
"It's Tristan!!

17:40.978 --> 17:42.844
"Congrats on your acquittal!

17:42.869 --> 17:45.430
"What did you think of my fan fiction?"

17:46.562 --> 17:47.805
[phone chimes]

17:47.915 --> 17:49.235
"Your lawyer gave me your number.

17:49.298 --> 17:51.035
"I hope that's okay!!"

17:52.494 --> 17:53.503
[phone chimes]

17:53.535 --> 17:56.335
[overlapping voices
reading text messages]

18:01.431 --> 18:02.977
TRISTAN: <i>"... and I love it."</i>

18:03.146 --> 18:04.974
CHANEL: <i>That I was
turning to Tristan now,</i>

18:04.999 --> 18:07.091
<i>meant that it was dark times indeed.</i>

18:09.555 --> 18:12.521
I don't understand
what's happening here.

18:12.748 --> 18:14.098
Who are these people?

18:14.123 --> 18:16.035
Chanel #7 and 8,

18:16.060 --> 18:18.333
Number Five, show some respect.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.293
One has Abe Lincoln disease,

18:20.318 --> 18:21.924
and the other one can't
move her face or something

18:21.949 --> 18:23.877
and is torture to talk to.

18:24.030 --> 18:26.245
Marfan, get out of the way.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.620
Who is that you're talking to?

18:27.645 --> 18:31.784
Number Five, may I
introduce Chanel Pour Homme?

18:33.000 --> 18:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:42.424 --> 18:45.307
What?! No. Okay, this is not allowed!

18:45.338 --> 18:49.172
A Chanel who is male and gay? I mean,
that's simply out of the question!

18:49.197 --> 18:51.452
He's gonna steal all of
our makeup and besides,

18:51.477 --> 18:53.360
Chanel, he seems like a serial killer.

18:53.385 --> 18:54.986
Okay, well, there's really
no need to keep whispering,

18:55.011 --> 18:56.305
because everybody heard that!

18:56.349 --> 18:58.392
And besides, gays don't murder people.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.291
I mean, they're a-a peaceful,

19:00.316 --> 19:01.680
- musical people, right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.150
Name me one gay serial killer.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.071
John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer.

19:05.096 --> 19:06.774
It's a good bet one of
those Menendez brothers

19:06.799 --> 19:08.393
was crawling into bed
with the other one, too.

19:08.418 --> 19:09.861
Okay, fine. You know what?

19:09.886 --> 19:11.664
Maybe he is a serial killer.

19:11.689 --> 19:13.131
But he's also a twee,

19:13.199 --> 19:14.916
which means we could
easily fight him off.

19:14.941 --> 19:16.534
- Mm-hmm.
- And Number Three and I

19:16.559 --> 19:18.681
aren't cleaning your
bedpans, Number Five.

19:18.706 --> 19:21.071
Plus, we should all
feel a little safer now

19:21.096 --> 19:24.442
that we're surrounded by our new
servants, slash human shields.

19:24.510 --> 19:26.868
- Wait. Your what?
- A toast.

19:26.893 --> 19:29.198
To Number Seven, Number Eight...

19:29.223 --> 19:31.549
- ... and Chanel pour Homme.
- Mm-hmm.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.430
CASSIDY: <i>Okay, so,</i>

19:36.455 --> 19:38.190
you were in the U.N. commissary,

19:38.215 --> 19:40.482
and it was lunchtime you said?

19:40.526 --> 19:42.694
[Southern accent]: Yes, I-I
slipped on a plantain heel,

19:42.719 --> 19:45.602
and I hit my head on the linoleum floor.

19:45.627 --> 19:46.792
I told you, now

19:46.817 --> 19:48.298
- I don't know how many times...
- Ms. Hotchkiss,

19:48.323 --> 19:50.213
you seem to be unaware of the fact

19:50.238 --> 19:53.471
that each time you speak,
you take on a different accent.

19:53.539 --> 19:55.673
- [Belgian accent]: What did you say?
- He's right.

19:55.741 --> 19:57.813
In the last ten minutes, you've done

19:57.838 --> 19:59.852
Texan, Austrian, Norwegian, Vietnamese,

19:59.877 --> 20:01.312
Algerian, Botswanan, Tajik

20:01.337 --> 20:03.932
and something that sort of
sounded like Bernie Sanders.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.551
Foreign Accent Syndrome...
that's what she has.

20:06.619 --> 20:07.971
There's no way there's actually

20:07.996 --> 20:09.120
something called
"Foreign Accent Syndrome."

20:09.152 --> 20:11.995
I spent the whole night going
through the medical files,

20:12.020 --> 20:13.463
going through white papers.

20:13.488 --> 20:15.376
Foreign Accent Syndrome is a real thing.

20:15.401 --> 20:16.837
Although it's extremely rare and

20:16.869 --> 20:19.627
usually associated with stroke
or traumatic brain injury.

20:19.893 --> 20:21.063
See, right here.

20:21.088 --> 20:23.243
First condition was identified in 1907.

20:23.259 --> 20:26.048
61 cases have been reported since 1941.

20:26.073 --> 20:27.159
[Scottish accent]: Now wait a minute.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.807
Are you saying I
might have had a stroke?

20:28.839 --> 20:31.207
[Scottish accent]: No.
You didn't have a stroke.

20:31.275 --> 20:34.001
Did I just say that in sort
of a weird Scottish accent?

20:34.026 --> 20:36.657
[Irish accent]: Yes. Why
did your accent just change?

20:36.682 --> 20:39.382
[Irish accent]: Maybe
it's contagious. Wait.

20:39.450 --> 20:42.471
Did I just say that in
a weird Irish accent?

20:42.659 --> 20:45.993
[Irish accent]: Sweet mother
in heaven. It is contagious.

20:46.018 --> 20:47.932
[Scottish accent]: Is
that a Canadian accent?

20:47.957 --> 20:50.915
Has this disease somehow
mutated and gone viral?

20:50.940 --> 20:53.661
Not Internet viral. Contagion viral.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.251
[Irish accent]: Oh, crap.

20:55.276 --> 20:57.563
This must be what happened to Madonna.

20:57.588 --> 20:59.276
We need to call her.

21:01.924 --> 21:03.143
- Thank you, Tristan.
- Mm-hmm.

21:03.168 --> 21:04.829
Now, stay close

21:04.854 --> 21:06.299
in case I need my face wiped

21:06.324 --> 21:08.979
or to have pieces of
arugula picked from my teeth.

21:10.113 --> 21:11.414
Tristan, what is this?

21:11.439 --> 21:13.287
It's some new fan fiction.

21:13.326 --> 21:15.967
All of these new stories
are just bursting out of me

21:15.992 --> 21:17.574
in thick ropes of inspiration.

21:17.599 --> 21:19.670
I can't stop writing.

21:20.891 --> 21:22.897
- What is on your lips?
- Nothing.

21:22.922 --> 21:24.976
- Did you steal my lipstick?
- No.

21:25.413 --> 21:27.177
That is Koko K on your lips.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.607
It is not. I wouldn't dare
steal any of your makeup.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.044
It's all expired, and who knows
what's living on your lips.

21:32.069 --> 21:34.796
[gasps] How dare you!

21:35.015 --> 21:37.708
Just for that, I'm gonna make
you go get me more sweatpants.

21:37.733 --> 21:39.308
These ones are full of farts.

21:39.376 --> 21:41.451
ZAYDAY: Guys! Stop arguing.

21:41.476 --> 21:44.491
Look what I found in the file we
got from the police department.

21:44.516 --> 21:48.296
A Jane Hollis filled out a missing
persons report for her husband Bill

21:48.321 --> 21:51.195
November 2, 1985.

21:51.694 --> 21:55.835
That's exactly 48 hours after that nurse
said she threw the patient in the swamp.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.662
I'm thinking if we
find this Jane Hollis,

21:57.687 --> 21:59.749
we might be able to figure
out who the killer is.

22:00.241 --> 22:02.331
Huh, there's an address
in the file, Number Five.

22:02.399 --> 22:04.624
Maybe if we're lucky,
she still lives there.

22:05.369 --> 22:06.769
[crickets chirring]

22:08.522 --> 22:09.546
[beep]

22:10.130 --> 22:12.577
[eerie moaning]

22:12.602 --> 22:15.116
[rhythmic beeping]

22:20.317 --> 22:22.251
[woman moaning]

22:25.073 --> 22:26.655
Hello?

22:28.025 --> 22:30.357
[moaning continues]

22:34.029 --> 22:36.873
[moaning continues]

22:49.984 --> 22:52.328
WOMAN [whispering]: Make them stop.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.060
Make who stop?

22:54.085 --> 22:56.732
The voices... in my head.

22:56.757 --> 22:58.976
Number Five, is that you?

22:59.499 --> 23:01.724
What are the voices telling you to do?

23:01.792 --> 23:04.393
[whispering]: Kill... you.

23:04.562 --> 23:05.648
[both scream]

23:05.673 --> 23:07.195
[laughing]

23:07.220 --> 23:08.755
What is wrong with you?

23:08.799 --> 23:10.666
I'm psychotic and a sociopath.

23:10.734 --> 23:13.864
I'm also allergic to
gluten, but most importantly,

23:13.935 --> 23:15.583
I miss you.

23:15.747 --> 23:16.839
A little birdie told me

23:16.864 --> 23:18.816
that you're recruiting new Chanels.

23:18.841 --> 23:21.222
I can't say I wasn't hurt
that you didn't ask me first.

23:21.247 --> 23:23.771
We didn't ask you to rejoin
because you tried to kill us!

23:23.796 --> 23:27.224
Which is exactly why you need me.

23:31.355 --> 23:32.669
Hey, whores...

23:32.826 --> 23:34.364
Hester is moving in with us.

23:34.388 --> 23:35.889
I prefer Chanel #6.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.891
[French accent]: No way!

23:37.958 --> 23:40.026
She's a murderer and a brunette.

23:40.094 --> 23:43.528
There would be dead people and dark
brown pubes all over the apartment.

23:43.992 --> 23:45.698
She told my parents

23:45.766 --> 23:47.033
to say that I was adopted.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.734
She also has the mind
of a serial killer,

23:48.759 --> 23:51.710
which means she can help
us avoid getting killed.

23:51.735 --> 23:53.773
And why are you speaking
in a French accent?

23:53.798 --> 23:55.460
[Italian accent]: A patient
came in with a disease

23:55.485 --> 23:57.610
that makes you speak
in-a foreign accents.

23:57.678 --> 23:59.379
It's-a contagious.

23:59.695 --> 24:03.149
Look, I appreciate that
bringing Hester here

24:03.174 --> 24:06.164
creates a small risk that she may
decide to slaughter us in our sleep,

24:06.189 --> 24:07.758
but I, for one, think the trade off

24:07.783 --> 24:09.576
of helping discover who
the Green Meanie killer is

24:09.601 --> 24:10.862
makes it worth it.

24:10.887 --> 24:13.765
Well, then, why doesn't she just
tell us who the killer is now?!

24:13.790 --> 24:15.656
It doesn't work that way.

24:15.681 --> 24:16.896
There are rules.

24:16.964 --> 24:18.387
Protocols.

24:18.412 --> 24:19.734
Watch. So, Hester,

24:19.759 --> 24:21.488
which one of the new
Chanels should we use as bait

24:21.513 --> 24:22.746
- to catch the Green Meanie
- Mm.

24:22.771 --> 24:24.671
and, thus, keep him from killing us.

24:24.738 --> 24:26.382
Great question, Chanel.

24:26.407 --> 24:28.821
The choice is obvious.
Kill the annoying twink.

24:28.846 --> 24:29.858
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

24:29.883 --> 24:31.641
[British accent]: I disagree.

24:34.180 --> 24:36.906
HESTER: Number Three,
I have all the answers.

24:38.758 --> 24:41.273
Fine. But she has to
room with Number Five,

24:41.298 --> 24:43.132
just in case she
decides to sleep-murder.

24:43.157 --> 24:45.023
And we cannot kill Twink.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.159
Ugh, fine!

24:46.227 --> 24:49.141
We'll kill Moebius girl. Agreed?

24:49.199 --> 24:50.900
Great.

24:50.925 --> 24:52.526
Number Five, I've got
to ask you something.

24:52.586 --> 24:53.906
When you were at the apartment earlier,

24:53.931 --> 24:55.672
there was a strange pair
of panties in the hamper

24:55.697 --> 24:57.859
that reeked of this
really strong perfume

24:57.884 --> 24:59.706
and I thought I recognized the smell,

24:59.773 --> 25:01.174
but then I remembered...

25:01.242 --> 25:03.195
that was Hester's perfume.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.911
But those are my panties.

25:04.987 --> 25:06.391
I really liked Hester's perfume,

25:06.416 --> 25:08.648
so I decided to start
dousing my panties in it.

25:09.172 --> 25:11.150
That's not what I was expecting.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.512
And what did you expect?

25:12.537 --> 25:14.238
That we finally tracked down Hester

25:14.263 --> 25:15.989
and asked her to live
in the apartment with us,

25:16.056 --> 25:17.582
so she could help us find the killer,

25:17.607 --> 25:19.590
even though it's possible
that she's the killer?

25:19.615 --> 25:21.121
That would be insane!

25:21.146 --> 25:22.780
That would be insane.

25:22.801 --> 25:24.568
Then maybe you should
just not worry about it.

25:24.636 --> 25:28.555
And maybe you should stop sniffing
panties that you pull out of the hamper.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.711
[doorbell rings]

25:36.365 --> 25:37.915
Ms. Jane Hollis.

25:38.334 --> 25:39.359
<i>I'm sorry, but</i>

25:39.384 --> 25:41.819
I haven't seen my son in years.

25:41.878 --> 25:45.053
We've never had what you
call a close relationship,

25:45.078 --> 25:47.024
but he is all I have.

25:47.092 --> 25:50.199
I never remarried and I
never had any more children.

25:50.816 --> 25:51.964
[gags]

25:52.980 --> 25:54.832
Uh, the coffee's disgusting.

25:54.899 --> 25:56.433
It's not coffee, it's tea.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.759
I'm pretty sure that I ordered coffee.

25:58.784 --> 26:01.802
You didn't order anything
because this is a home,

26:01.827 --> 26:03.261
not a restaurant.

26:03.706 --> 26:05.095
So, Ms. Hollis,

26:05.120 --> 26:07.377
speaking of your husband, um...

26:07.463 --> 26:08.870
what do you think happened to him?

26:08.895 --> 26:10.781
Well, I think he died that night.

26:10.841 --> 26:12.933
I think Dr. Mike and Nurse Thomas

26:12.966 --> 26:15.058
faked the paperwork releasing
him from the hospital

26:15.090 --> 26:18.288
and then just tossed his body into
the swamp to cover their tracks.

26:18.356 --> 26:19.523
I'm sure of it.

26:19.591 --> 26:20.964
Are you... sure...

26:20.989 --> 26:23.200
that they dumped the body in the swamp?

26:23.364 --> 26:26.934
And are you sure that you aren't
the one who murdered your husband?

26:27.364 --> 26:29.700
Look... maybe you two
got into an argument.

26:29.767 --> 26:32.178
You fly off the handle,
accidentally murder him,

26:32.203 --> 26:33.670
and then, what are you gonna do?

26:33.738 --> 26:36.089
You have to figure out a
way to get rid of the body.

26:36.121 --> 26:38.282
And what better way

26:38.307 --> 26:40.448
to dispose of your husband's dead body,

26:40.473 --> 26:43.021
than bringing him to the ER,
complaining of chest pains

26:43.046 --> 26:45.849
and then leaving it to Dr.
Mike and poor Nurse Thomas

26:45.874 --> 26:48.011
to throw him in the swamp for you.

26:48.036 --> 26:49.920
I didn't murder my husband.

26:49.988 --> 26:52.083
I'm so sorry.

26:52.114 --> 26:54.301
Could you just give us a moment, please?

26:54.419 --> 26:56.020
[Zayday clears her throat]

26:56.239 --> 26:58.034
What is wrong with you?

26:58.059 --> 26:59.784
You are the worst sidekick ever.

26:59.809 --> 27:01.104
I'm sorry.

27:01.129 --> 27:03.393
I thought we were trying
to solve a murder here.

27:03.971 --> 27:05.669
Forgive me for asking
the tough questions.

27:05.737 --> 27:07.393
Those aren't tough questions.

27:07.448 --> 27:08.455
Look, it doesn't matter.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.107
Let's just get out of here
because we already know

27:10.132 --> 27:12.342
what we came here to find out.

27:12.410 --> 27:14.190
That the baby in the
belly can't be Chamberlain.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.448
- Why?
- Because she's white.

27:17.518 --> 27:20.484
Um, Chanel #5 and I are
gonna have to run. We, uh...

27:20.509 --> 27:22.479
we forgot we had an appointment.

27:22.504 --> 27:24.713
[chuckles] Thank you for your time.

27:24.789 --> 27:26.557
- [chuckles]
- Oh.

27:26.994 --> 27:30.424
Who is that NBA player
with you in that photo?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.886
Oh, was it like a
Make-A-Wish sort of situation

27:32.911 --> 27:34.901
after your husband was murdered?

27:34.932 --> 27:37.143
That is my husband.

27:44.322 --> 27:45.906
ZAYDAY: <i>Do you know what this means?</i>

27:45.931 --> 27:47.986
Of course I don't.

27:48.103 --> 27:51.009
This means that Chamberlain
could be the baby in the belly.

27:51.612 --> 27:54.486
I guess you're not such
a bad sidekick, after all.

27:58.329 --> 28:00.548
This doesn't make any sense.

28:00.837 --> 28:04.140
She said she fell backwards
and hit her head, right?

28:04.626 --> 28:07.554
[South African accent]: But the part
of the brain that processes language

28:07.579 --> 28:09.189
is called the Broca's area

28:09.214 --> 28:12.251
and it's located in
the front of the brain.

28:12.782 --> 28:15.859
Oh. I think my accent just changed.

28:15.884 --> 28:17.562
[British accent]: Yes,
I just noticed that.

28:17.587 --> 28:19.155
I mean, it's still a terrible accent,

28:19.222 --> 28:21.557
but before you sounded like
Keanu in <i>Dracula.</i>

28:21.625 --> 28:24.077
[Australian accent]: Now you sound
like Leo in <i>Blood Diamond.</i>

28:24.145 --> 28:26.171
Crap, I think mine just changed, too.

28:26.196 --> 28:30.476
Yeah, before you sounded like Winona
Ryder in <i>The Crucible</i> and...

28:30.501 --> 28:33.952
now you sort of sound like Cameron
Diaz in <i>Gangs of New York.</i>

28:33.977 --> 28:34.991

I think I got a cure.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.897
Damn it. My accent keeps changing.

28:38.922 --> 28:41.482
Now I sound like Dick Van
Dyke in <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

28:41.507 --> 28:44.256
What exactly did you
figure out? What's the cure?

28:44.281 --> 28:46.866
[German accent]: Now, that is
the worst accent I've ever heard.

28:46.952 --> 28:50.219
When Ms. Hotchkiss
fell and hit her head,

28:50.287 --> 28:52.015
she suffered a mild concussion,

28:52.040 --> 28:56.230
which caused swelling in the part
of the brain that processes language.

28:56.379 --> 28:58.403
[Australian accent]: Right,
but the MRI showed swelling

28:58.428 --> 29:00.296
in the anterior part of the brain

29:00.389 --> 29:02.965
and the Broca's area is
in the frontal lobe...

29:03.033 --> 29:04.795
As the first of two neural structures

29:04.820 --> 29:06.326
sub-serving linguistic processing.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.702
[German accent]: The
Broca's area in the front

29:08.727 --> 29:11.978
and the Wernicke's area in the back...

29:12.750 --> 29:15.870
precisely where the
MRI indicated swelling.

29:16.048 --> 29:18.414
[English accent]: Wait,
now you sound like Brad Pitt

29:18.447 --> 29:20.510
in <i>Seven Years in Tibet.</i>

29:20.884 --> 29:23.564
So, what do you propose?

29:23.846 --> 29:25.437
- [Polish accent]: Steroids?
- Mm-hmm.

29:25.462 --> 29:26.617
Why steroids?

29:26.642 --> 29:30.326
[German accent]: It should reduce
the swelling in the temporal gyrus

29:30.385 --> 29:31.903
of the brain's dominant hemisphere,

29:31.928 --> 29:33.820
which, in this case,
happens to be the left.

29:33.845 --> 29:34.931
I mean, it'll take me, what?

29:34.956 --> 29:37.199
Ten, 15 minutes to
prepare the injection?

29:37.267 --> 29:39.883
Then I'll have you on a plane back
to the U.N. in time for supper.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.036
Ah, eh...

29:41.104 --> 29:42.838
[Polish accent]: Oh, thank you.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.607
I'm so relieved.

29:44.674 --> 29:47.641
But that doesn't explain what's
happening to the three of you.

29:47.666 --> 29:50.407
[in German accent]: I know. I fear
the three of us will speak in...

29:50.432 --> 29:52.321
[Scottish accent]: sad,
inconsistent accents

29:52.346 --> 29:54.026
[in German accent]: for
the rest of our lives.

29:58.716 --> 30:01.533
Come on, let's go, little guy.

30:02.411 --> 30:04.178
All right, here we go.

30:06.271 --> 30:08.338
ZAYDAY: You're a real
freak, you know that?

30:08.783 --> 30:12.151
Okay, hold on, many men enjoy light
butt play during sex, all right?

30:12.291 --> 30:14.618
Doesn't make us freaks.
I am as God made me.

30:14.650 --> 30:17.268
I'm talking about the kind of freak
who just walks in off the street

30:17.300 --> 30:19.634
and pretends to get hired at a hospital.

30:20.243 --> 30:21.594
Okay, you caught me.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.016
All right? I'm sorry I lied,

30:23.041 --> 30:25.247
but there's nothing freaky about this.

30:25.315 --> 30:27.368
I just really like
helping people, you know?

30:27.393 --> 30:30.019
And I was looking for a
professional environment to do it in.

30:30.086 --> 30:31.594
You know the kind of looks I get

30:31.619 --> 30:33.799
wheeling around a magic
cart on the streets,

30:33.824 --> 30:35.182
randomly doing good deeds?

30:35.225 --> 30:37.359
And you just happened to,
what? Choose this hospital?

30:37.427 --> 30:39.328
Yeah, it's walking
distance from the house.

30:39.396 --> 30:43.112
How can I wheel this big ass cart all
the way across town to County General?

30:43.137 --> 30:45.467
They'd never let me on the bus, ever.

30:45.535 --> 30:47.830
This is crazy. Man, I
thought you was different.

30:48.002 --> 30:50.157
I thought you would understand
that there are actually some people

30:50.182 --> 30:53.351
who don't want to feel rich or
be superior to everybody else.

30:53.376 --> 30:54.534
For some people,

30:54.559 --> 30:57.010
putting a smile on somebody's
face is payment enough.

30:57.034 --> 30:58.034
[cat meows]

30:59.487 --> 31:02.760
Look, Zayday, all right,
I'm a good person, okay?

31:03.018 --> 31:04.829
So, if that makes me a freak,

31:04.854 --> 31:07.252
then I'm-a let my freak flag fly.

31:08.090 --> 31:10.080
How you feeling today?

31:11.495 --> 31:12.495
[door opens]

31:12.549 --> 31:13.798
[posh British accent]: Hello, everyone.

31:13.823 --> 31:15.508
I have good news and better news.

31:15.533 --> 31:16.844
The good news is

31:16.869 --> 31:18.243
our accents have all apparently

31:18.268 --> 31:20.206
settled into the same dignified,

31:20.231 --> 31:23.197
upper-crust, inconsistent
English accent.

31:23.239 --> 31:24.640
[posh British accent]:
It's really incredible.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.508
We sound like the cast of
<i>Remains of the Day.</i>

31:26.576 --> 31:29.469
The better news is I
think I found a cure.

31:29.635 --> 31:33.330
Now, I found nothing in
the medical literature

31:33.355 --> 31:35.729
about spontaneous
Foreign Accent Syndrome

31:35.754 --> 31:37.955
occurring without the
presence of brain trauma,

31:37.980 --> 31:40.276
except... a really obscure paper

31:40.301 --> 31:42.925
by an evolutionary
biologist named Kleinfeldt

31:42.993 --> 31:44.393
from the University of Vienna,

31:44.461 --> 31:46.899
who coined the term "Madonna Syndrome."

31:46.924 --> 31:49.219
- Madonna Syndrome?
- BROCK: Madonna Syndrome, yes.

31:49.244 --> 31:50.923
You see, when you're
around a foreign accent,

31:50.948 --> 31:53.237
you start picking it up
so you don't stand out.

31:53.401 --> 31:56.839
It's a method of social camouflage
for the cultural outsider.

31:56.906 --> 31:58.704
You see, the more you fit in,

31:58.729 --> 32:00.409
the more likely you are to procreate.

32:00.434 --> 32:02.658
[posh British accent]: Okay,
well, how do you cure it?

32:02.683 --> 32:06.248
Kleinfeldt called the technique
"Total Visuo-Linguistic Immersion."

32:06.316 --> 32:08.118
We basically lock ourselves in a room

32:08.143 --> 32:10.330
and watch nothing but
movies and tele-shows

32:10.355 --> 32:12.704
that feature straight-down-the-line,
American accents.

32:12.729 --> 32:15.596
The three of us will spend
the weekend watching these.

32:15.971 --> 32:16.977
Ah.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.612
<i>Love American Style...</i>

32:18.637 --> 32:20.703
ooh, <i>American Bandstand...</i>

32:20.963 --> 32:22.467
<i>American Gigolo.</i>

32:22.596 --> 32:26.518
And I thought we'd start by
binge-watching <i>The Americans.</i>

32:26.596 --> 32:28.471
<i>The Americans is about Russians.</i>

32:28.496 --> 32:30.033
That's, like, the
whole point of the show.

32:30.058 --> 32:31.323
BROCK: Fine. Then we'll binge-watch

32:31.331 --> 32:33.332
Neil Diamond singing
"Coming to America."

32:33.393 --> 32:36.687
It's a rousing anthem that every
American should watch, in my opinion.

32:36.712 --> 32:38.479
It's what we need as a nation.

32:38.547 --> 32:40.846
Um... I can't.

32:41.183 --> 32:44.010
I've got something planned this weekend.

32:44.707 --> 32:46.135
I'm sorry.

32:48.987 --> 32:52.026
Well... looks as though it's just, uh...

32:54.440 --> 32:56.643
going to be you and me.

32:58.620 --> 32:59.753
[knocking]

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
Yes?

33:03.620 --> 33:05.260
You wanted to see me.

33:05.307 --> 33:07.674
Yes, please, come in.

33:07.699 --> 33:09.133
Um...

33:09.322 --> 33:11.072
why don't you take a seat?

33:11.111 --> 33:13.791
Actually, you know, I'm
gonna save you the effort.

33:13.816 --> 33:14.869
You're fired.

33:14.894 --> 33:17.031
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

33:17.099 --> 33:20.650
I don't like the way you treat my staff.

33:20.675 --> 33:22.471
Oh, I presume you're
talking about the Chanels,

33:22.496 --> 33:25.377
whom you hired as doctors, despite
the fact they're not doctors.

33:25.402 --> 33:26.869
It's my hospital.

33:26.986 --> 33:28.424
It runs on my funding,

33:28.449 --> 33:30.479
which means I can hire whomever I choose

33:30.504 --> 33:33.104
to perform whatever
task I deem appropriate.

33:33.129 --> 33:34.322
And, frankly,

33:34.347 --> 33:38.221
the way you treat and
speak to the Chanels is,

33:38.246 --> 33:39.275
"A." offensive,

33:39.300 --> 33:40.306
and "B"...

33:40.346 --> 33:42.229
you're obviously addicted to pethidine.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.963
Addicted?

33:44.440 --> 33:46.707
Where do you get off,
you boozy, old hag?

33:46.775 --> 33:49.361
Yes! I take a daily dose of pethidine!

33:49.386 --> 33:51.512
A-a-and, yes, it's a very large dose,

33:51.580 --> 33:54.282
something like you would
prescribe for a Clydesdale.

33:54.307 --> 33:56.003
But you know what? I love it!

33:56.028 --> 33:59.520
It is, hands down, the
best friend I have ever had.

33:59.588 --> 34:01.088
It is lover, friend,

34:01.128 --> 34:05.041
all wrapped up in some
tiny, little, white tuxedo.

34:05.093 --> 34:06.729
I mean, I do. I do, I
do. I think about it.

34:06.754 --> 34:09.746
I think about it at morning,
noon, and night, but addicted? No!

34:09.771 --> 34:11.181
I am not.

34:11.440 --> 34:15.402
Yes, I obviously am, but how
dare you, you creaky, old whore!

34:15.471 --> 34:18.056
I want your office
cleaned out in an hour.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.119
Oh, no.

34:25.804 --> 34:29.280
I don't think I'm going
to be going anywhere.

34:29.373 --> 34:30.650
I just fired you.

34:30.676 --> 34:33.120
And I think you're about to rehire me.

34:33.554 --> 34:36.958
Unless you want word
out about your disease.

34:38.025 --> 34:39.132
That's right.

34:39.157 --> 34:42.330
I know all about your little
terminal illness you picked up

34:42.355 --> 34:45.952
accidentally eating human
brains, which is insane,

34:45.976 --> 34:47.632
but somehow not quite as crazy

34:47.657 --> 34:49.944
as accidentally getting
on a plane to New Guinea

34:49.969 --> 34:52.655
when you thought you
were headed to New Jersey.

34:53.675 --> 34:58.246
I... I just wonder what the press
would do with that little nugget.

34:58.437 --> 35:00.952
Oh, wait, I can see the headlines now.

35:01.272 --> 35:04.108

35:04.133 --> 35:06.740
"buys hospital, still dies."

35:07.288 --> 35:08.456
You wouldn't.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.857
I will.

35:09.925 --> 35:11.626
Wait, wait, what's that?

35:11.693 --> 35:16.124
Oh... I think that's the
sound of me getting rehired.

35:19.067 --> 35:20.986
Don't cross me, slut,

35:21.011 --> 35:25.039

it's the last thing you do.

While you were gone,

it would be super fun

38:34.842 --> 38:36.943
- Um, I...
- Yeah, I heard all about it.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.683
- Chanel #5 told me.
- Okay...

38:38.708 --> 38:40.713
You stupid bitch!

38:40.781 --> 38:42.520
Chanel, a man died.

38:42.545 --> 38:44.138
I didn't want Chanel Pour Homme to die.

38:44.163 --> 38:45.895
I sent Chanel #8 to the morgue.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.606
I'm standing right here!

38:47.631 --> 38:49.620
[posh accent]: You know, the
more that I think about it,

38:49.645 --> 38:51.825
I don't really think we
thought this plan through.

38:51.850 --> 38:54.333
Yes, we did. These Chanels are bait.

38:54.358 --> 38:56.329
Yes, but we never set a trap.

38:56.397 --> 38:58.294
The Green Meanie just
took the bait and got away.

38:58.319 --> 38:59.849
And where is Hester?

38:59.874 --> 39:01.388
Her cell is empty.

39:01.413 --> 39:02.969
If I don't find out
what happened to her,

39:03.037 --> 39:05.692
I'm gonna have to report
that breach to the FBI.

39:05.717 --> 39:07.559
I don't know where Hester is.

39:07.584 --> 39:09.675
I mean, am I my sister's keeper?!

39:09.743 --> 39:11.532
Maybe she killed herself!

39:11.557 --> 39:13.773
Or maybe she's moved
to a neighboring state

39:13.798 --> 39:16.970
with a less onerous tax burden
and started killing people there.

39:17.314 --> 39:19.148
Honestly, that's probably what happened.

39:19.173 --> 39:21.939
I mean, she is always going on
about how onerous the taxes are here.

39:21.964 --> 39:23.072
- Isn't that right?
- Totally.

39:23.097 --> 39:25.058
- So onerous.
- Stop talking!

39:26.540 --> 39:28.173
I must commend you.

39:29.446 --> 39:31.619
- Your idea had merit.
- [chuckles]

39:31.644 --> 39:35.030
I mean, with the added influx
of new patients to this hospital,

39:35.055 --> 39:36.259
the workload here has doubled,

39:36.284 --> 39:39.505
so if these Chanels help
you work more efficiently,

39:39.530 --> 39:41.804
then I'm all for it.

39:41.829 --> 39:43.609
Although I officially

39:43.677 --> 39:46.236
cannot condone the... [clears throat]

39:46.261 --> 39:47.377
you know?

39:47.402 --> 39:50.774
Look, we get it. We're human shields.

39:50.799 --> 39:52.758
We can all stop pussyfooting around it,

39:52.783 --> 39:55.655
because I, myself, am
fine with the arrangement.

39:55.722 --> 39:58.424
I've really gotten used to the clothes.

39:58.492 --> 40:01.322
MUNSCH: Well, to your point,

40:01.931 --> 40:05.008
I have taken the liberty

40:05.033 --> 40:08.283
of adding some
additional Chanels myself.

40:08.308 --> 40:09.892
Ladies!

40:12.478 --> 40:16.024
This is Addison, Andrea, and Midge.

40:16.049 --> 40:20.413
Chanel #9 here is a
semiprofessional Dungeon Master.

40:20.438 --> 40:23.618
Chanel #10 was born with no kidneys

40:23.643 --> 40:26.652
but has 30 extra feet
of large intestine.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.623
And Chanel #11 has 11 fingers.

40:30.626 --> 40:31.626
[gasps]

40:32.008 --> 40:34.931
Yeah. So, Chanels #9 through #11,

40:34.956 --> 40:37.462
meet Chanels #1 through #8.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.955
Listen up, bovines.

40:41.980 --> 40:44.804
Polite society says we can't haze you.

40:44.872 --> 40:46.642
But we can insist

40:46.667 --> 40:49.709
that you clean Chanel #5's
bedpans before we return home.

40:49.734 --> 40:52.145
And she takes <i>monster</i> dumps.

40:52.170 --> 40:53.868
I want that thing sanitized.

40:53.893 --> 40:55.532
I want it so clean

40:55.557 --> 40:58.845
that we could eat
novelty sundaes out of it!

41:03.298 --> 41:04.531
Now!

41:08.323 --> 41:09.729
Now...

41:10.292 --> 41:14.565
I am going to find out what happened
to Hester if it's the last thing I do.

41:14.590 --> 41:19.370
And if it turns out that you three
harbored a known serial killer,

41:19.395 --> 41:22.713
I am going to report you
as accessories to murder.

41:22.738 --> 41:26.257
And when they sentence
you to the electric chair,

41:26.282 --> 41:29.549
I'm gonna stand there and watch you fry.

41:31.073 --> 41:32.698
- Now...
- [squeaks]

41:32.723 --> 41:35.292
who wants to tell me where Hester is?

41:43.597 --> 41:46.402
I don't get it. What's in it for us?

41:46.441 --> 41:48.066
Like, do we get paid?

41:48.091 --> 41:51.191
I don't know. I think it's
more like an internship.

41:52.012 --> 41:53.579
[screaming]

41:57.539 --> 41:59.140
[screaming]

42:07.443 --> 42:09.468
Oh, my God.

42:12.257 --> 42:13.593
Thank you!

42:25.714 --> 42:27.550
[door opens]

42:28.532 --> 42:30.376
- Baby, is that you?
- [door shuts]

42:30.444 --> 42:32.712
I'm making breakfast for dinner.

42:32.779 --> 42:35.313
I know how much you like that.

42:35.773 --> 42:37.212
CASSIDY: Hi, Mom.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.821
Smells delicious.

42:41.888 --> 42:44.110
Wash your hands and sit.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.594
Some people came by from the hospital.

42:49.079 --> 42:51.297
They know about your dad.

42:52.118 --> 42:54.433
They asked about you.

42:54.501 --> 42:57.618
Well, not you, exactly, but...

42:57.815 --> 42:59.501
my baby.

43:00.884 --> 43:03.751
You think we need to
do something about it?

43:07.934 --> 43:09.446
Don't worry, Mom.

43:13.212 --> 43:15.121
I'll take care of everything.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.719
You are so good to me.

43:20.063 --> 43:21.627
After all you've been through

43:21.695 --> 43:23.641
and all you've done for me,

43:23.666 --> 43:25.291
you deserve it.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.571
You deserve the whole world.
