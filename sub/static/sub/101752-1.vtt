01:11.307 --> 01:12.557
- Who did this?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.163
Mikey, look,

01:23.035 --> 01:24.553
Untie me.

01:24.553 --> 01:26.303
- I need the formula.

01:27.627 --> 01:30.480
I'm giving you five seconds.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.813
- Don't, no matter what this
is, it's with me, right?

01:33.813 --> 01:35.280
Not with her.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.240
- Five.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.760
- Listen.
- You don't get it!

01:37.760 --> 01:39.584
He'll kill everyone I love.

01:39.584 --> 01:41.090
- He'll fucking lie to you.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.700
He'll fucking lie to you--
- Four.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.001
- Put the fucking--

01:45.001 --> 01:46.850
Son of a fuck!

01:46.850 --> 01:48.873
God damn it!

01:49.830 --> 01:50.663
- Three.

01:51.566 --> 01:52.997
- What do you want me to do, man?

01:52.997 --> 01:54.040
You want me to fucking write it down?

01:54.040 --> 01:55.000
- Where is it?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.357
- Please, please, just give come on,

01:58.861 --> 01:59.793
just give me a chance, all right?

01:59.793 --> 02:02.510
- Give you a chance, after
you tried to get me killed?

02:02.510 --> 02:04.910
- Mikey, he lied to you.

02:04.910 --> 02:07.898
Don't do this to me, please
help me, please don't do this.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.611
- Where's the fucking notebook?

02:09.611 --> 02:12.213
- Okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.450
All right, it's...

02:19.923 --> 02:22.420
It's five, four, uh...

02:23.340 --> 02:24.810
Fuck you talking about?

02:24.810 --> 02:26.660
- Just give me a fucking chance, man!

02:32.340 --> 02:33.173
- One.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.023
- Oh fuck.

02:49.023 --> 02:50.673
It's nice to finally meet you.

02:55.157 --> 02:56.150
I don't want trouble.

02:56.150 --> 02:57.793
- Yeah see, I kind of do.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.930
Is that a fucking real rooster, man?

03:09.110 --> 03:10.603
Big daddy, cane.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.483
You know you're you're you're
pretty little girlfriend?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.920
You're not going to be
able to protect her.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
I took care of that.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.236
- Well, what do we have here?

03:42.236 --> 03:45.033
- Hey, I'm all good guys, I'm all good.

03:46.398 --> 03:47.490
Hey where are you going?

03:47.490 --> 03:48.397
- I said I'm good.

03:48.397 --> 03:49.363
- No, we heard you.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.063
Come on, identification.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.770
- Think I'm gonna throw this to DEA.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.040
Let's take him downtown.
- All right.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.190
- Can I go now or like?

04:10.190 --> 04:11.953
- Oh, you're not going anywhere.

04:11.953 --> 04:14.060
Aright, hand above your
head, hands above your head,

04:14.060 --> 04:16.681
interlock your fingers, spread 'em!

04:16.681 --> 04:17.630
- You got a weapon on you, son?

04:17.630 --> 04:20.003
- No!

04:20.843 --> 04:23.203
- Ah, what is this?

04:23.203 --> 04:24.603
What do you suppose that is?

04:26.520 --> 04:27.353
- Look, that's not mine.

04:27.353 --> 04:28.960
The dude you just saw him--

04:28.960 --> 04:31.998
- Oh, I guess I made a mistake, oops.

04:33.986 --> 04:34.883
- Hands above your head!

04:34.883 --> 04:37.086
Hands above your fucking head!

04:37.086 --> 04:39.150
- And now you've got assaulting a cop.

04:39.150 --> 04:39.983
Oops.

04:41.020 --> 04:42.040
Guess I'm gonna take you in.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.430
Right hand, thank you.

04:44.768 --> 04:46.419
All right, left hand, thank you.

04:46.419 --> 04:50.230
- You're a sick person!
- Oh, thank you very much.

04:50.230 --> 04:51.063
You have the right to remain silent,

04:51.063 --> 04:53.689
anything you say can and
will be held against you

04:53.689 --> 04:54.712
in a court of law.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.283
You got a right to an attorney.

04:56.283 --> 04:58.783
You can't afford an attorney--

05:03.540 --> 05:05.363
- Alex, honey, come on!

05:11.330 --> 05:13.960
So how long did it take you this time?

05:13.960 --> 05:14.930
- Two minutes

05:16.502 --> 05:17.597
- Hm, that's not bad.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.120
- Alex Chesler.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.833
Born November 23, 1994.

05:48.062 --> 05:52.363
Sun Valley, SPU High, top of class.

05:53.690 --> 05:55.793
Attended UCLA at age 16.

05:59.674 --> 06:03.430
- Baby, I got a note from your teacher.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.360
- I swear I didn't do it.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.920
- No, no, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

06:06.920 --> 06:07.753
Just read it.

06:18.873 --> 06:19.706
- I don't want to change class.

06:19.706 --> 06:21.037
- It's where all the all
the smarter kids go, Alex.

06:21.037 --> 06:23.480
- But I don't want to be a smarter kid.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.893
Please don't make me, Mom.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.370
- Okay, okay.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.093
You'll stay with Mrs. Gustavo.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.463
- Are you mad at me?

06:37.660 --> 06:38.493
- Of course not.

06:39.430 --> 06:42.343
You listen to me, no matter
what I love you, okay?

06:45.242 --> 06:46.650
Why don't you go outside and
chase a bird or something?

06:46.650 --> 06:47.800
I need some mommy time.

06:58.420 --> 06:59.873
- Dropped out one year later.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.163
No criminal records.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.750
- You have nothing on me.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.030
- Actually, Mr. Chesler, you
assaulted a police officer.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.380
- I didn't touch him.

07:15.380 --> 07:16.930
- Not according to his partner.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.380
And you've got

07:24.640 --> 07:25.473
Loco.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.330
Kind of looks like bath salts, right?

07:36.460 --> 07:38.913
I'm DEA, John Delaney.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.560
I can make all this go away.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.583
I help you, you help me.

07:49.586 --> 07:52.047
Or I can give you a try
with the boys in blue.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.970
- I'm in trouble with the Talome's people.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.773
- Talome.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.667
- If he finds me, I'm dead.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.539
I'm gonna be okay.

09:42.513 --> 09:44.250
- Whoa slick.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.410
It's wrong, but slick.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.767
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

09:47.767 --> 09:49.410
- Hey man, don't worry.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.273
I haven't told anybody what you've done.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.100
Smile for the camera.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.183
- Shit.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.660
- Yeah, you got two options here.

09:59.601 --> 10:03.373
I could tell the owner and he's
he's a card carrying prick.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.993
Or you can put the money
right back where you found.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.053
- Prove it.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.613
- That owner happens to be me.

10:18.181 --> 10:20.700
You ever been in trouble
with the law, son?

10:20.700 --> 10:22.200
- Look sir, I'm sorry.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.033
- Sorry?

10:24.494 --> 10:26.853
Hell, sorry never paid for a fucking bill.

10:28.730 --> 10:29.873
You need work?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.473
I need someone to deliver
some glass for me.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.513
- What?

10:38.380 --> 10:39.430
- I'll give you an extra a hundred

10:39.430 --> 10:40.730
when you get back with it.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.853
- Glass, what is this?

10:52.350 --> 10:53.393
- It's a delivery.

10:54.580 --> 10:55.680
You need money, right?

10:57.340 --> 10:59.230
I mean, you're stealing
from my fucking waitresses--

10:59.230 --> 11:00.130
- Delivering what?

11:08.690 --> 11:10.500
This is longitude and latitude?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.410
- Hey, you in or you out?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.913
- Yo, you Alex?
- You Jason?

11:38.410 --> 11:39.560
- Here, delivery bitch.

11:40.870 --> 11:41.951
Don't break that shit.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.573
- Do you know what all this is for?

11:44.466 --> 11:46.370
- What, Lester ain't tell you?

11:46.370 --> 11:47.203
- Lester?

11:51.038 --> 11:52.705
- Here, put this on.

11:55.677 --> 11:57.200
You want to make bread, right?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.033
- With a blindfold?

11:58.033 --> 11:59.250
- Man, if you don't put
the fucking blindfold--

11:59.250 --> 12:02.290
- Dude, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna put a...

12:02.290 --> 12:03.130
I just got...

12:04.360 --> 12:05.560
I'm not doing this, man.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.376
- Yo!

12:08.376 --> 12:09.209
- What, what?

12:09.209 --> 12:10.042
I'm not gonna put on a--

12:10.042 --> 12:10.875
- You don't get it?

12:13.047 --> 12:14.473
It's a fucking golden ticket, man.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.080
Honestly, you fucking
look like you need one.

12:23.178 --> 12:24.761
What's it gonna be?

12:28.292 --> 12:29.125
Put the fucking blindfold on, man

12:29.125 --> 12:29.958
and listen to what I say.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.320
Put that in the fucking back.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.660
- We done?

12:32.660 --> 12:33.493
Thank you!

12:51.989 --> 12:52.873
- All right, we're here.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.290
- It's yeah, beautiful.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.240
- Yeah, take the fucking blindfold off.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.723
- Where are we?
- Lester's.

13:01.030 --> 13:01.863
- Get out.

13:04.710 --> 13:07.690
Can't believe Chef got me
driving you around anyway.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.240
Like I'm some damn Lyft driver.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.043
- Great, easy peasy, right?

13:54.670 --> 13:57.120
Go drop that in the kitchen,
I'll be right there.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.133
Come on.

14:02.620 --> 14:03.670
Don't touch anything!

14:17.360 --> 14:18.810
- I'll take that hundred now.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.443
- All business, I like that.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.133
Let me show you something.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.380
- Is this the part where you kill me?

14:45.380 --> 14:46.213
- Maybe.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.900
It's just for protection.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.330
- Sorry, I don't, I don't play with fire.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.730
- Yeah, well me neither.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.033
Fire's for amateurs.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.513
So, this is where I do all my cooking.

15:06.660 --> 15:07.810
You got your test tubes, you got your--

15:07.810 --> 15:10.793
- Volumetric glass, porous silicate,

15:12.360 --> 15:13.393
conical flasks.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.348
You're a drug cook.

15:20.924 --> 15:22.960
- That's very good.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.093
I'm one of the best.

15:26.450 --> 15:28.160
- I can't be here, I can't.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.410
- Hey, you come this far.

15:30.349 --> 15:31.182
It's not so bad.

15:31.182 --> 15:32.015
- It is bad.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.923
- Hey, you need a job, right?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.420
This is me helping you out.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.253
- I don't need that kind of help.

15:38.253 --> 15:39.600
- It don't look that way to me.

15:44.409 --> 15:48.620
- Don't lie to me, what's
your day job again?

15:48.620 --> 15:51.160
- You get a day job when
you're not good at anything.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.263
- Didn't you inherit
property from your mom?

15:54.430 --> 15:56.085
- Yeah, that's all we had.

15:56.085 --> 15:56.918
- Where is it?

15:56.918 --> 15:59.168
- She was in the hospital
for a long ass time

16:00.610 --> 16:02.260
and they kicked me out in a week.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.830
Bank wants to break even, I guess.

16:30.643 --> 16:32.730
- I can help with those.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.480
- I know honey, I think I
just need a little more help

16:34.480 --> 16:35.873
than math right now.

16:42.373 --> 16:43.206
Okay.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.449
- Don't worry about it, I got you.

17:03.449 --> 17:04.282
- Hello.

17:04.282 --> 17:05.263
- Nice to meet you too.

17:07.195 --> 17:08.028
- Thank you.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.063
- Don't thank me yet.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.800
I saw you talking to Lester.

17:13.734 --> 17:15.013
What were you guys talking about?

17:16.260 --> 17:17.823
- I didn't know you knew him.

17:18.995 --> 17:20.595
- You didn't answer my question.

17:21.650 --> 17:24.110
What were you guys talking about?

17:24.110 --> 17:25.650
- Nothing.

17:25.650 --> 17:27.360
Don't you work here?

17:27.360 --> 17:28.943
- I pick up shifts.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.450
Lester doesn't just talk to anybody

17:34.720 --> 17:36.170
and he doesn't do small talk.

17:37.993 --> 17:40.365
- What's it to you?

17:40.365 --> 17:41.198
- A job.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.450
I think you should take it.

17:44.450 --> 17:45.590
- Really?

17:45.590 --> 17:47.500
Who made you my career counselor?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.130
- Whatever he offered you, you need it.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.130
I've seen you around here before
looking like a lost puppy.

17:52.130 --> 17:55.240
Every single time, it's
kind of depressing.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.559
- Why don't you work with him?

17:57.559 --> 17:58.392
- I do.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.533
- Hey.
- Hey, so you're in.

18:34.416 --> 18:36.553
- Well, I mean, I didn't
bring a blindfold.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.580
- So before we start, two rules.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.730
Rule number one, if you
tell anyone what I'm about

18:45.730 --> 18:50.603
to teach you, I'm going
to kill you, myself.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.393
You got it?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.473
- You don't have to worry
about me, man, I'm good.

18:57.858 --> 18:58.691
I got it.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.843
- Rule number two,

19:03.240 --> 19:05.393
stay away from Lydia.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.070
I need you to take this
seriously, not personally,

19:10.070 --> 19:10.903
do you understand me?

19:10.903 --> 19:12.130
- How do you know that--

19:12.130 --> 19:13.963
- Do you understand me?

19:32.010 --> 19:34.790
- Look who it is, delivery bitch.

19:34.790 --> 19:38.850
- Alex, my name is Alex.

19:38.850 --> 19:41.000
- Yo Skaggs, you sure
we can we trust fool?

19:42.220 --> 19:44.803
- I don't know, Alex, can we trust you?

19:46.680 --> 19:48.230
- Why do we even need him?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.640
You were teachin' me how to cook.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.680
- 'Cause last time I taught you a lesson

19:51.680 --> 19:53.330
you nearly blew up the place, man.

19:53.330 --> 19:54.390
- That was one time.

19:54.390 --> 19:55.990
- You can't even cook eggs, bro.

19:57.510 --> 20:00.890
- Jason, you distribute, right?

20:00.890 --> 20:03.930
The more cooks, the more
product you guys have to sling.

20:03.930 --> 20:05.710
It means more money for everybody, got it?

20:05.710 --> 20:06.573
- Yeah, got it.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.953
- But he looks like a fucking snitch.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.663
You even got that snitch face.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.650
- Snitch face?
- I'm sorry, bitch face.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.144
How bout that?

20:19.870 --> 20:22.843
- He's clean, trust me.

20:24.990 --> 20:25.840
- We'll see then.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.273
- All right, let's get started.

20:44.030 --> 20:44.863
- Just us?

20:46.930 --> 20:48.610
So you gonna break this down for me or?

20:48.610 --> 20:50.203
- The kids call it Loco.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.440
- What's that?

21:03.440 --> 21:05.083
- This is the recipe.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.833
This stays with me at all times.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.213
Got it?

22:21.620 --> 22:23.060
Wow.

22:23.060 --> 22:24.460
You want to hear the kicker?

22:25.780 --> 22:29.670
This beautiful baby is completely legal.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.200
- Ain't no shit like it.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.720
- How is that even remotely--

22:32.720 --> 22:35.880
- Bath salt and other similar compounds,

22:35.880 --> 22:39.700
they have qualities that
make them narcotics by law.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.973
But a good cook is a scientist.

22:45.020 --> 22:47.700
Certain chemical reactions
can change the composite

22:47.700 --> 22:50.693
of a substance substantially,
even completely.

22:51.530 --> 22:52.990
Make those chemicals undetectable,

22:52.990 --> 22:55.443
yet adequately potent.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.923
Even more so in our case.

23:01.270 --> 23:02.103
- That's crazy.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.490
- It's not crazy.

23:04.490 --> 23:05.413
It's Loco.

23:08.591 --> 23:09.424
Aw, shit.

23:09.424 --> 23:11.610
Aye, Lydia, you got try this shit.

23:11.610 --> 23:12.883
- No, I'm good.

23:12.883 --> 23:15.057
- It's a good batch, just try it.

23:15.057 --> 23:17.128
- I don't want to try it.
- Try it!

23:17.128 --> 23:18.289
- I don't want to try it!

23:18.289 --> 23:19.122
- Just take one hit, just fucking try it!

23:19.122 --> 23:20.172
- Why are you so worried about what I do?

23:20.172 --> 23:21.770
Why are you so pissed about me trying it?

23:21.770 --> 23:24.320
- Hey guys, hey, hey, Jason,
watch your mouth, man.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.870
Look, don't disrespect her, okay.

23:26.870 --> 23:29.002
If she doesn't want to
do it, she doesn't do it.

23:29.002 --> 23:30.544
- Fine.

23:30.544 --> 23:32.463
Shut the fuck up, then.

23:32.463 --> 23:34.120
- What about you, Alex?

23:34.120 --> 23:35.970
A good cook always tastes his recipe.

23:37.110 --> 23:40.828
- Oh, I'm good, I don't, I don't do drugs.

23:40.828 --> 23:42.664
- I don't do drugs.

23:42.664 --> 23:45.160
It's cool, though, get
the fuck outta here.

23:46.980 --> 23:49.585
- If Lydia doesn't do it, why should I?

24:40.575 --> 24:42.200
- Unlock it.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.033
- You're not allowed to--

24:43.033 --> 24:45.533
- Don't make me ask you again.

25:01.538 --> 25:02.680
Is that the formula there?

25:02.680 --> 25:04.480
- Are you not listening to my story?

25:12.320 --> 25:13.153
- That Lydia?

25:15.950 --> 25:16.783
- Yes.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.443
- I don't have time for this shit.

25:22.674 --> 25:23.507
What's the formula?

25:23.507 --> 25:24.430
- It's complicated.

25:24.430 --> 25:26.030
Page of fucking scribbles.

25:26.030 --> 25:28.160
- And where's the notebook, huh?

25:28.160 --> 25:29.463
I need to stop this prick.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.300
You really want to help
a guy who takes advantage

25:32.300 --> 25:33.513
of lost kids like you?

25:34.870 --> 25:36.040
- He's not so bad.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.983
- He's a fake, a con artist, a liar.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.163
- You know him?

25:43.556 --> 25:45.656
- Look, I've been on this case for months.

25:47.430 --> 25:50.557
I'm this close, what's the formula?

25:50.557 --> 25:52.990
- No, I cooked with Lester
like a handful of times.

25:52.990 --> 25:55.160
You really think he'd let me
anywhere near that notebook?

25:55.160 --> 25:56.850
- Where's the kitchen, then?

25:56.850 --> 25:57.900
The den, where is it?

26:05.450 --> 26:08.280
- You didn't have to
take that shit, you know.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.570
- I didn't take shit.

26:09.570 --> 26:12.170
There's wasn't enough
time to take fucking...

26:12.170 --> 26:14.230
- Can you guys reel him
the fuck in, please?

26:14.230 --> 26:15.397
- Yeah, hey.

26:15.397 --> 26:16.480
- What's up, Chef?

26:16.480 --> 26:19.660
- Hey, knock it off, knock it off.

26:19.660 --> 26:20.693
Jason's going to take
you out in the field.

26:20.693 --> 26:23.740
He's going to show you the
distribution side of things.

26:23.740 --> 26:25.410
Okay?
- Right now?

26:25.410 --> 26:27.340
- Yes, right now, come on, time is money.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.190
Let's go, let's go!

26:28.190 --> 26:29.780
- Let's go delivery bitch.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.610
- I like that better than snitch face.

26:31.610 --> 26:32.737
- I don't give a fuck.

27:23.189 --> 27:24.439
- Where are we?

27:28.369 --> 27:30.210
Have we been selling all night?

27:30.210 --> 27:32.760
- Come on, you know, we
got to get that paper full.

27:35.374 --> 27:36.833
We night hunt, Alex.

27:39.510 --> 27:42.860
- Aw man, I haven't even
seen shit like this money.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.059
- I know you haven't.

27:44.059 --> 27:45.160
That's some real money.

27:45.160 --> 27:45.993
- Jesus.

27:47.530 --> 27:49.280
- She probably sold more than Loco.

27:50.605 --> 27:52.783
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.980
- Oh Chef, see that?

27:56.980 --> 27:58.820
Lydia had another big night!

27:58.820 --> 28:00.230
Listen, if I had tits and ass like her,

28:00.230 --> 28:01.425
I'd probably be selling--

28:01.425 --> 28:03.008
- Enough is enough!

28:05.970 --> 28:08.910
This is bullshit money.

28:08.910 --> 28:10.530
This is kid stuff.

28:10.530 --> 28:12.100
- Don't worry about me, I got it.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.420
- Maybe if you stop using it

28:13.420 --> 28:15.190
and you start fucking
selling it, I don't know,

28:15.190 --> 28:16.120
you might make another enough--

28:16.120 --> 28:18.264
- Maybe if you shut the fuck
up when you're not being--

28:24.739 --> 28:28.343
- If you don't figure this out,
I'll figure it out for you.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.313
You got it?

28:51.210 --> 28:52.210
Get some sleep boys.

29:03.969 --> 29:04.802
- Guess you did all right.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.311
- Oh, all right?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.411
You guess?
- I guess.

29:09.050 --> 29:10.083
- I fucking know.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.214
- So what's up, we hitting
the strip club, strip club?

29:13.214 --> 29:14.490
Hitting the strip club?

29:14.490 --> 29:18.620
Come on, stripper ass, come on baby.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.530
I'm out.
- Bye!

29:20.400 --> 29:21.900
Bitches here I come!

29:24.020 --> 29:27.603
- Hey, do you want to grab some food?

29:29.150 --> 29:31.800
Well, what do people
talk about besides eggs?

29:31.800 --> 29:32.633
- I don't know.

29:33.930 --> 29:36.073
You tell me, I'm not much of a sharer, so.

29:37.850 --> 29:39.133
- What's your family like?

29:40.836 --> 29:42.867
- I have a little brother
I'm taking care of, so.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.890
That's all you got to know.

29:45.890 --> 29:48.590
- And that led to Lester?
- Joey didn't lead to shit.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.493
This is my decision, okay.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.873
- Joey, sounds like a cute kid.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.093
- He is.

30:05.850 --> 30:08.390
We call him our Christmas miracle.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.150
- He was born on Christmas?

30:10.150 --> 30:12.870
- Yeah, it's cliche, right?

30:12.870 --> 30:14.620
- No, it saves money on presents.

30:14.620 --> 30:15.823
- Boom, exactly!

30:20.543 --> 30:21.793
What about you?

30:23.940 --> 30:25.140
What's your family like?

30:31.340 --> 30:32.173
- My mom,

30:33.860 --> 30:34.693
she died

30:36.980 --> 30:37.813
a few weeks ago.

30:40.210 --> 30:41.210
- What was she like?

30:43.690 --> 30:44.653
- Selfless.

30:47.350 --> 30:48.253
Encouraging.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.810
Like, I was her only child,

30:50.810 --> 30:52.903
so she always made sure I had everything.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.370
I love her very much.

31:07.806 --> 31:08.889
I found this.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.113
This necklace,

31:17.330 --> 31:19.223
the only thing left that was,

31:20.880 --> 31:25.880
was ever really hers and me.

31:37.110 --> 31:38.954
- What about your dad?

31:38.954 --> 31:40.954
- I don't even remember.

31:42.050 --> 31:43.250
Save it for another day.

31:45.260 --> 31:46.093
- What?

31:46.093 --> 31:47.190
I mean like--
- Please.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.323
- Okay.

31:52.910 --> 31:54.560
- It went on like that for a bit.

31:59.470 --> 32:01.020
I need to make sure she's safe.

32:04.230 --> 32:06.223
I'm not giving you shit until I know that.

33:03.330 --> 33:04.330
- Good luck tonight.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.180
- How much longer are you keeping me here?

33:14.180 --> 33:15.620
- You still haven't told
me where the kitchen is.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.483
- I don't know.

33:18.610 --> 33:21.240
I went to this corner,
they blindfolded me,

33:21.240 --> 33:22.490
I showed up at the house.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.000
It's the same thing every time.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.280
- We put them away you off the hook.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.440
- Talome's still gonna
be after me and Lydia.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.690
- That name again.

33:33.690 --> 33:35.623
- You really haven't heard about this guy?

33:36.790 --> 33:38.543
- He's a drug kingpin.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.330
He's like the holy ghost of the streets.

33:42.330 --> 33:44.130
People are fucking terrified of him.

33:44.995 --> 33:45.828
And he runs everything.

33:45.828 --> 33:48.450
He takes a cut of everything
from all the local businesses,

33:48.450 --> 33:49.963
promising them protection.

33:51.470 --> 33:53.700
All the drug dealers hate him.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.270
They want them out and
some of them I've tried,

33:55.270 --> 33:59.840
but he has eyes and ears
on every single corner.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.140
- So why haven't the cops brought him down

34:01.140 --> 34:02.700
if he's so everywhere?

34:02.700 --> 34:05.440
- Because nobody knows what
the fuck he looks like.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.633
He gets everyone else to
do his dirty work for him.

34:32.083 --> 34:33.110
No one will ever turn him in.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.570
No one will ever give him up.

34:37.390 --> 34:39.480
He just destroys their lives.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.980
And he doesn't come after you.

34:42.670 --> 34:44.270
He goes after everyone you love.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.810
- Who's this?

34:49.810 --> 34:50.643
- Hi.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.140
We're just finishing up
a little transaction.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.373
Your stuff's in the car,
I'll talk to you later.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.233
- Wait, what?

35:03.233 --> 35:04.463
- I'll talk to you later.

35:09.822 --> 35:12.309
- Okay.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.790
Hey you, what's going on?

36:05.790 --> 36:06.623
Who was that?

36:06.623 --> 36:07.777
- No one don't walk so close to me.

36:07.777 --> 36:09.090
- No, he's definitely somebody.

36:09.090 --> 36:09.923
I saw him grab--

36:09.923 --> 36:11.230
- We can't be seen together.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.150
- What?

36:14.150 --> 36:16.290
- What is so hard to comprehend, Alex?

36:16.290 --> 36:18.053
We can't be seen together.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.781
- So what am I just, just breakfast.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.569
- What about it?

36:24.569 --> 36:26.969
We're working together
to make money, that's it.

36:39.000 --> 36:39.833
- Seriously?

36:45.990 --> 36:46.823
Hey Chef!

36:48.486 --> 36:49.563
What's cooking?

36:50.570 --> 36:51.897
You know, 'cause.

36:54.850 --> 36:55.683
What's up?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.583
- You broke rule number two.

37:00.550 --> 37:03.030
- Broke, I'm sorry, I didn't--

37:06.920 --> 37:08.778
- Let me give them to you fresh, huh.

37:08.778 --> 37:09.611
- Get off me!

37:09.611 --> 37:11.133
- Stay away from Lydia.

37:12.916 --> 37:14.090
- We just go to the diner, it's not--

37:14.090 --> 37:17.820
- I don't need you to go near her, right.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.530
I will destroy you, that is a promise.

37:19.530 --> 37:20.700
- Look, it's not like--

37:20.700 --> 37:21.623
- Shut up!

37:23.657 --> 37:26.670
Now I see and I hear everything.

37:26.670 --> 37:31.280
When you eat, I know when you
to sleep, I fucking know it.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.557
I know everything.

37:37.143 --> 37:39.003
I don't need you to go near her.

37:43.119 --> 37:45.619
You're incredibly replaceable.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.750
- This is textbook manipulation.

37:52.750 --> 37:55.030
You're smart kid, you can see that?

37:55.030 --> 37:57.460
- He's just protective
of Lydia, that's all.

37:57.460 --> 37:58.410
- What about Jason?

38:01.370 --> 38:02.203
Jason.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.117
Talk.

38:13.896 --> 38:15.810
- Get off me!

38:15.810 --> 38:17.477
Get off me, get off!

38:24.566 --> 38:27.700
- So I'm gonna ask you again,

38:27.700 --> 38:28.800
where's your supplier?

38:31.980 --> 38:34.003
- I told you, I bought it dickhead.

38:37.856 --> 38:38.773
- Dickhead?

38:40.370 --> 38:42.650
My name is Demetrius.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.543
Now, you bought it from?

38:48.030 --> 38:48.863
Silence?

38:51.690 --> 38:53.690
This here, this little piggy right here,

38:54.910 --> 38:56.220
went to the market.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.230
You bought it from?

39:05.098 --> 39:06.360
You're gonna spit on my
new shines, just like that?

39:06.360 --> 39:08.370
- Fuck your shoes!
- Fuck my shoes.

39:08.370 --> 39:09.210
Fuck my shoes.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.370
I got a brand new shine, fuck my my shoes.

39:11.370 --> 39:12.702
Hammer time.

39:17.830 --> 39:18.663
I know.

39:20.310 --> 39:22.093
Let me see this.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.460
Dixie, hole that for me, would you?

39:29.170 --> 39:34.170
This little piggy had roast, right?

39:34.610 --> 39:35.443
Let me see.

39:36.989 --> 39:38.572
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:43.540 --> 39:45.193
Fuck you!

39:47.440 --> 39:51.823
- Do me a favor, kiss this hammer.

39:53.020 --> 39:53.973
Actually, fuck it.

39:55.971 --> 39:58.221
Hammer mother fucking time!

40:03.390 --> 40:04.943
- Lester, what are we going to do?

40:06.229 --> 40:07.807
- Well, we've been lazy.

40:07.807 --> 40:09.107
You couldn't count on him.

40:10.460 --> 40:12.033
So fucking stupid.

40:14.805 --> 40:16.965
That pig probably squealed.

40:20.410 --> 40:22.110
- It's all you fucking care about.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.580
Jason is dead!

40:26.580 --> 40:28.680
- Clean him up, I can smell him from here.

40:32.040 --> 40:32.873
- Go to hell.

40:36.359 --> 40:40.123
- Go ahead, honey, where you gonna go?

40:42.752 --> 40:45.109
Shut up, shut it!

41:07.590 --> 41:08.740
- Where's Jason's body?

41:09.960 --> 41:10.793
- No clue.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.240
Not on the news either.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.820
Aren't you guys supposed to be
all over that kind of thing?

41:17.820 --> 41:19.561
- What's his full name?

41:19.561 --> 41:20.394
- I don't know.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.227
- Don't fuck with me.

41:21.227 --> 41:22.820
- Look, we weren't buds.

41:22.820 --> 41:24.453
He did his thing, I did mine.

41:26.630 --> 41:31.127
- You can lie all you want,
it's not gonna save you.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.243
- I don't know shit.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.153
- And Lydia?

41:38.370 --> 41:39.797
- Hey, what's up?

41:39.797 --> 41:41.350
This is the batch?

41:41.350 --> 41:42.980
What's wrong?

41:42.980 --> 41:44.753
- I'm so stupid, I should've known.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.320
- What are you talking about?

41:48.690 --> 41:49.953
- She's working with Talome.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.193
- You high?

41:54.193 --> 41:55.026
Come on, she not--

41:55.026 --> 41:56.073
- I'm not high.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.093
You see, I'm thinking perfectly clear.

42:00.070 --> 42:03.850
She bailed on us, now she's screwing us.

42:03.850 --> 42:04.910
Hey, hey!

42:04.910 --> 42:07.093
I don't know what's going on.

42:08.449 --> 42:10.043
I mean quiet doesn't add up.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.540
Maybe she's after the formula.

42:13.540 --> 42:14.990
Did you give her the formula?

42:16.150 --> 42:18.690
- Oh, you think I have
a photographic memory?

42:18.690 --> 42:20.537
I mean, I can list off
the ingredients you want,

42:20.537 --> 42:24.953
but it's this notebook that
makes Loco, okay, period.

42:31.810 --> 42:32.910
- Answer the question.

42:34.670 --> 42:36.263
Did you give her the formula?

42:37.430 --> 42:38.263
- No.

42:45.810 --> 42:49.083
- Well, you don't know what
this business does to a person.

42:51.330 --> 42:55.491
Look, I just need you to follow her.

42:55.491 --> 42:56.450
- You want me to stay away from her

42:56.450 --> 42:57.950
and now you want me stalking her?

42:57.950 --> 42:59.900
- Pay attention!
- I'm not doing that.

43:05.813 --> 43:09.730
- Well, I guess all three
of us are going down.

43:13.990 --> 43:14.823
Yeah.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.793
Oh, he's good.

43:28.024 --> 43:28.860
- What do you mean?

43:28.860 --> 43:30.710
- Knowing you have a thing for Lydia.

43:32.090 --> 43:33.890
He never stops.

43:33.890 --> 43:36.050
- You got it all figured out.

43:36.050 --> 43:39.863
- Trust me, he's got you wrapped
around his little finger.

43:41.910 --> 43:42.933
Think about it.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.760
He's brought you into a
dangerous and volatile business

43:46.760 --> 43:49.143
when you were vulnerable and broke.

43:49.980 --> 43:51.480
He knows you're hot for Lydia.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.290
He convinces you she's lying,

43:55.290 --> 43:57.540
the only person on earth
that you care about.

43:59.530 --> 44:01.463
So all you have to rely upon his him.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.067
Pure manipulation.

45:21.470 --> 45:23.210
- Look like you need a friend.

45:24.318 --> 45:26.830
- Lester know I been hanging out here?

45:26.830 --> 45:27.910
- I mean, this place
might be his money front,

45:27.910 --> 45:30.807
but I don't think he watches it 24/7.

45:31.769 --> 45:32.753
And he didn't send me.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.640
You know, a hi usually works too.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.653
- Sorry, I just,

45:40.980 --> 45:43.530
I can't stop thinking about
what they did to Jason.

45:46.060 --> 45:47.493
It was just so vicious.

45:48.770 --> 45:50.110
And then it's not even on TV.

45:50.110 --> 45:51.910
It's like it never fucking happened.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.233
- Yeah, I know.

45:57.630 --> 45:58.930
- What are you doing here?

46:00.600 --> 46:01.433
- It's cheap.

46:04.660 --> 46:06.330
- So you still see Lester?

46:06.330 --> 46:07.163
- Sometimes.

46:08.030 --> 46:09.263
You?
- No.

46:10.380 --> 46:11.593
Not if I can help it.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.230
I'm done with everything.

46:16.090 --> 46:17.340
Can't even fucking sleep.

46:18.970 --> 46:21.070
Feel like I'm gonna be next.

46:21.070 --> 46:24.183
- Yeah, it's that way for me too.

46:27.950 --> 46:29.403
- Thanks for the shake.

46:30.910 --> 46:32.143
- If you ever need anything.

46:33.403 --> 46:34.820
I know.

46:51.005 --> 46:55.540
- Whew, didn't realize this
was so touching, Romeo.

46:55.540 --> 46:56.440
- Are we finished?

46:58.250 --> 47:00.700
- Didn't expect to hear
a love story, that's all.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.820
Lester, I imagine he's gonna gut you

47:07.820 --> 47:09.793
as soon as he finds out.

47:09.793 --> 47:11.270
- I'm just helping her.

47:11.270 --> 47:12.890
- Helping her?

47:12.890 --> 47:15.624
Is that what kids are
calling it these days?

47:15.624 --> 47:16.540
- Okay, I don't know
what happened between you

47:16.540 --> 47:19.500
and Lester, but I don't need
to be in the middle of it.

47:19.500 --> 47:20.333
- It's too late.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.253
- Does anyone know you're here?

47:39.180 --> 47:40.140
- No.

47:40.140 --> 47:42.433
- Good, so give it to me.

47:50.206 --> 47:51.367
I'm gonna need to get more.

47:51.367 --> 47:53.440
These little bags, bullshit.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.540
- Well, it's not easy.

47:55.415 --> 47:56.460
I'm doing what I can.

47:56.460 --> 47:58.624
- You need to try harder.

47:58.624 --> 48:00.717
You understand what the
fuck I'm telling you?

48:02.880 --> 48:05.220
- Yeah.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.053
- Good.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.970
- Can we talk somewhere else?

48:53.480 --> 48:54.443
- Enjoy the music.

49:00.260 --> 49:02.810
- She meets with this guy
in the middle of the day.

49:04.410 --> 49:05.283
Near the diner.

49:07.310 --> 49:09.260
She always hands him a brown paper bag.

49:13.020 --> 49:15.803
- What's in the bag?
- Loco.

49:17.390 --> 49:18.860
- Not possible.

49:18.860 --> 49:21.090
Where would she be getting it?

49:21.090 --> 49:22.273
- Off the streets.

49:24.092 --> 49:26.160
- No, the stuff we pushed,
it'd be sold by now.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.493
It'd be used up.

49:30.390 --> 49:31.343
- Her own stash?

49:32.850 --> 49:33.923
- Keep on this.

49:36.260 --> 49:37.470
Losing Jason and Lydia,

49:37.470 --> 49:39.890
I've got to find some new distributors.

49:39.890 --> 49:40.723
- I can do it if--

49:40.723 --> 49:43.280
- No, no, no, it'll be handled.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.093
You just keep digging deeper.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.353
- Stay here.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.130
Who's your favorite basketball player?

49:57.130 --> 50:01.536
- My favorite basketball
player is Michael Jordan.

50:01.536 --> 50:03.450
- Hey, do you want to go
for basketball real quick?

50:03.450 --> 50:05.023
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

50:11.012 --> 50:13.280
- So I'm starting to believe

50:13.280 --> 50:14.730
that you are stalking me now.

50:16.340 --> 50:17.920
- And if I was?

50:17.920 --> 50:19.770
- What are you doing here, Alex?

50:19.770 --> 50:22.140
- You mentioned this park
before and not to sell near

50:22.140 --> 50:24.180
here, cause you, you take Joey.

50:24.180 --> 50:26.263
- Oh, it's nice to know you pay attention.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.153
- To you.

50:33.610 --> 50:36.363
- I force him to come outside
so he can make friends.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.360
- How's that going?

50:40.900 --> 50:41.763
- Honestly,

50:42.636 --> 50:44.920
it's not that good.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.840
I mean, he's really stubborn.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.440
He's too smart for his own good

50:48.440 --> 50:52.800
so kids make fun of him
at school, call him weird,

50:52.800 --> 50:53.633
stuff like that.

50:55.330 --> 50:57.540
- Yeah, I used to get that all the time.

50:57.540 --> 50:58.750
- You?

50:58.750 --> 50:59.770
- Oh for sure, yeah.

50:59.770 --> 51:01.770
There was a time when I was a real geek.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.033
- Was?

51:07.217 --> 51:10.120
- I was thinking though, we
should grab dinner later.

51:12.620 --> 51:13.870
Talk about a weird I was.

51:20.847 --> 51:23.401
the phone I got issues

51:32.005 --> 51:33.560
I've had a thing for you for so long.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.393
- Oh shut up.

51:34.393 --> 51:36.770
- It's ridiculous.
- Shut up, you're lying.

51:36.770 --> 51:37.713
- No, it's true.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.560
- So then why didn't you say
anything to me before all this?

51:43.480 --> 51:44.313
- I don't know.

51:45.660 --> 51:48.750
You're, you're you, like look at you.

51:48.750 --> 51:50.623
- What?
- Lydia.

51:53.004 --> 51:54.312
- What does that even mean?

51:54.312 --> 51:55.562
- I don't know.

51:57.233 --> 51:59.183
Just always thought you were beautiful.

52:00.630 --> 52:01.463
Fascinating.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.153
I was right.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.153
- I'm,

52:08.980 --> 52:10.503
I'm not any of those things.

52:12.110 --> 52:12.943
- You are to me.

52:17.010 --> 52:19.380
- You don't even know me, Alex.

52:19.380 --> 52:23.133
- Well, I know you love
your brother fiercely.

52:24.050 --> 52:26.450
You passed up on some big
sister time to hang with me.

52:26.450 --> 52:28.850
That's pretty cool in my book.

52:28.850 --> 52:29.860
- Oh please, first of all,

52:29.860 --> 52:32.250
I was just trying to clear my head.

52:32.250 --> 52:35.440
- Oh, so that's what this was?
- Yeah, exactly.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.913
- Served my purpose.
- Yeah.

52:38.679 --> 52:39.512
No, I,

52:42.143 --> 52:43.523
I do like you Alex.

52:45.590 --> 52:47.490
It's just the people that I care about

52:50.310 --> 52:51.210
don't really last.

52:59.194 --> 53:00.527
As soon as I can

53:01.600 --> 53:03.600
I'm getting Joey and
we're getting out of this

53:03.600 --> 53:04.913
fucked up town.

53:08.350 --> 53:09.183
One day.

53:16.396 --> 53:17.563
- Let me help.

53:20.224 --> 53:22.874
- You don't know what you're
talking about right now.

53:26.793 --> 53:27.626
- I do.

53:34.324 --> 53:37.289
the phone I got issues

54:35.462 --> 54:37.530
- We call him our Christmas miracle.

54:37.530 --> 54:39.534
- He was born on Christmas?

54:39.534 --> 54:40.784
Yeah.

54:53.080 --> 54:53.913
- No names.

54:56.253 --> 55:01.253
What are you up to?

55:02.868 --> 55:03.701
- Alex?

55:16.929 --> 55:18.103
- Hey, what's up?

55:19.720 --> 55:23.220
- Nothing, I was seeing where you went.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.163
- Sorry, nature called.

55:28.240 --> 55:30.200
- Did you put the toilet seat down?

55:30.200 --> 55:31.150
- Duh!

55:31.150 --> 55:32.400
My momma raised me right.

55:42.482 --> 55:43.790
I know you're trying to get him out,

55:43.790 --> 55:46.160
but whatever it is you're doing,

55:46.160 --> 55:47.610
is it really the best way--

55:47.610 --> 55:50.823
- I'm exploring all my
options, Alex, okay?

55:52.455 --> 55:53.620
- What about the guy at the dinner?

55:53.620 --> 55:55.230
- What about him?

55:55.230 --> 55:56.063
He's nobody.

55:58.440 --> 56:00.180
Why does it matter?

56:00.180 --> 56:01.030
- No, it doesn't.

56:02.070 --> 56:04.863
- Great, then we don't
have to talk about it.

56:07.570 --> 56:08.403
- Okay.

56:13.630 --> 56:15.870
I think it's dangerous to be bringing

56:15.870 --> 56:18.020
one of Talome's guys through the diner.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.343
- And what if he was?

56:21.690 --> 56:23.290
With Talome, what would you say?

56:35.547 --> 56:37.617
- Lester thinks Lydia's with Talome?

56:38.770 --> 56:40.670
You think Lydia is playing both sides.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.310
Meanwhile, you're spying behind her back

56:44.310 --> 56:47.833
while you're practically inside
her, Jesus fucking Christ.

56:51.210 --> 56:52.933
Tell me about the guy at the diner.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.190
The one with Lydia.

56:56.860 --> 56:58.490
Any tattoos?

56:58.490 --> 57:01.730
Height, eye color?

57:01.730 --> 57:03.140
- He was white.

57:03.140 --> 57:05.647
He was like 5'11.

57:05.647 --> 57:06.480
You know, I really didn't get to gaze

57:06.480 --> 57:07.680
into his eyes there, John.

57:07.680 --> 57:08.770
- Don't get smart.

57:08.770 --> 57:10.290
- You think everything I
tell you is total bullshit

57:10.290 --> 57:11.630
then why the hell are we still talking?

57:11.630 --> 57:13.830
- So you looked through
her shit, then what?

57:24.795 --> 57:26.962
- See you later with more.

58:06.623 --> 58:07.893
- I suck at this, man.

58:09.880 --> 58:10.860
- Open the door!

58:10.860 --> 58:11.693
- Like bad.

58:13.612 --> 58:14.470
- What are you doing here?

58:14.470 --> 58:16.087
- Nothing I'm just, I'm just--

58:17.500 --> 58:19.730
- Leave me alone, I never
want to see you again.

58:19.730 --> 58:20.563
- Why?

58:20.563 --> 58:22.530
- Just stop please!

58:22.530 --> 58:23.960
- I'm trying to protect you.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.280
- Trying to protect me?

58:25.280 --> 58:26.930
Do you want to end up like Jason?

58:33.430 --> 58:36.760
- You're right, I'm sorry.

58:36.760 --> 58:38.970
I'll leave you alone.
- Good.

58:38.970 --> 58:42.510
- Now get out of my face and
never see me again, got it?

58:42.510 --> 58:43.343
- Got it.

58:55.820 --> 58:57.710
Hey!
- Don't ask.

58:57.710 --> 58:58.865
- What the hell is going on?

58:58.865 --> 59:00.240
- You don't take direction that well.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.060
- If you're in trouble, let me help you.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.954
- Alex, I can't.

59:03.954 --> 59:05.260
- Oh yeah, you can trust me.

59:05.260 --> 59:06.710
- You don't understand.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.933
- Please, for me.

59:10.922 --> 59:11.755
I want to help.

59:16.690 --> 59:18.040
- I'm working with the FBI.

59:21.910 --> 59:22.743
- How did this hap--

59:22.743 --> 59:25.470
- Alex, it's this or let
Joey be trapped with my mom

59:25.470 --> 59:26.893
for the rest of his life.

59:27.980 --> 59:30.193
They fucking cornered me.
- When?

59:33.310 --> 59:34.190
- I was...

59:36.640 --> 59:39.110
I dealing Loco on
Columbia and Dover street

59:39.110 --> 59:41.250
and these two guys pulled
up, got out of the car,

59:41.250 --> 59:43.613
flashed their badges and
told me to get in the back.

59:46.338 --> 59:48.038
- You're the only family he's got.

59:48.990 --> 59:50.560
You can help me.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.393
I made a deal.

59:51.393 --> 59:54.380
If you do it for
anybody, do it for Joey.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.800
- I have to give up Lester

59:55.800 --> 59:58.583
and I need you to testify against him.

1:00:01.850 --> 1:00:03.383
- I can't let you do that.

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:07.673
- Alex, listen to me.

1:00:09.270 --> 1:00:12.070
If we don't, I never see you again.

1:00:12.070 --> 1:00:13.880
They have pictures, they have evidence,

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:15.043
they have everything.

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:17.533
It's over.

1:00:20.110 --> 1:00:22.499
- What have you been bringing them?

1:00:22.499 --> 1:00:23.332
In the brown bags?

1:00:23.332 --> 1:00:24.730
- So you have been fucking stalking me!

1:00:24.730 --> 1:00:25.920
- Lydia.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:27.133
- Loco, okay?

1:00:28.550 --> 1:00:30.500
I've been skimming the batches for weeks.

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:31.850
- My batches.

1:00:31.850 --> 1:00:33.897
- They wanted it for testing or some shit.

1:00:33.897 --> 1:00:35.300
- He was like a father to you

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:36.570
and he helped you through so much.

1:00:36.570 --> 1:00:39.120
- I did what I could to protect him.

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.997
I gave him signals to leave
town, but then when Jason was--

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:50.283
I knew that I had to give the rest up.

1:00:52.312 --> 1:00:55.070
We had gone too far and they
know about the diner now, too.

1:00:55.070 --> 1:00:57.053
It's only a matter of fucking time!

1:01:00.710 --> 1:01:03.063
We don't have to go down with him, Alex.

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:08.037
You told me that you would help me

1:01:10.707 --> 1:01:12.433
and now I need you Alex.

1:01:15.250 --> 1:01:17.350
He's been using us the whole fucking time.

1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:21.017
- No, Lydia's not so stupid after all.

1:01:22.290 --> 1:01:23.950
You get a last name?

1:01:23.950 --> 1:01:25.970
- It's Kane with a K, Kane.

1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:40.160
- Hey, run this for me.

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.683
Lydia Kane, K-A-N-E.

1:01:45.350 --> 1:01:47.960
Yeah, I have a suspect telling
me she's an FBI informant

1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:49.550
working the Lester Skaggs case.

1:01:49.550 --> 1:01:50.900
Can you check if it's true?

1:01:52.644 --> 1:01:54.061
All right, great.

1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:00.790
I got my guys on it.

1:02:00.790 --> 1:02:03.140
If she's really on the
inside, I'll let you go.

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:18.693
Meet me outside town.

1:02:20.950 --> 1:02:22.023
Location to follow.

1:02:41.651 --> 1:02:43.020
- Are you out of your fucking mind!

1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:44.050
- We have to talk!

1:02:44.050 --> 1:02:45.603
Not here, out, out!

1:02:46.922 --> 1:02:48.193
- This better be fucking good!

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:00.183
- She came by yesterday.

1:03:02.660 --> 1:03:03.910
She explained everything.

1:03:05.930 --> 1:03:06.763
- And?

1:03:08.152 --> 1:03:08.985
- Fuck!

1:03:10.379 --> 1:03:11.424
- Well, what'd she say?

1:03:11.424 --> 1:03:13.160
- I don't know what to do anymore, man,

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:14.573
I don't know what do you expect--

1:03:14.573 --> 1:03:16.490
- Come on, fucking, Alex!

1:03:16.490 --> 1:03:18.063
You're not telling me anything.

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:22.950
Fuck, I ain't got time for this shit.

1:03:22.950 --> 1:03:24.500
- She made a deal with the FBI.

1:03:26.810 --> 1:03:27.643
You were right.

1:03:29.710 --> 1:03:30.543
She flipped.

1:03:33.110 --> 1:03:37.553
They know about the lab, everything.

1:03:39.450 --> 1:03:40.593
You were dead on about her.

1:03:42.870 --> 1:03:43.703
You happy?

1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:48.713
- No shit.

1:03:50.650 --> 1:03:53.620
- Listen, you got to go underground.

1:03:53.620 --> 1:03:54.780
It's not safe here, you have to--

1:03:54.780 --> 1:03:55.833
- Leave me alone.

1:03:57.536 --> 1:03:58.530
- What?

1:03:58.530 --> 1:04:00.160
- Lay low, wait for my instructions.

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:00.993
- Instructions?

1:04:00.993 --> 1:04:01.826
Fucking tell you--

1:04:01.826 --> 1:04:03.140
- I said fucking

1:04:06.090 --> 1:04:07.183
leave me alone.

1:04:12.910 --> 1:04:13.760
- It's like that?

1:04:23.170 --> 1:04:24.103
- Just like that.

1:04:46.700 --> 1:04:47.927
- You all right?

1:04:50.870 --> 1:04:51.703
- I'm good.

1:04:52.883 --> 1:04:53.833
- Did you bring it?

1:04:57.770 --> 1:04:58.603
- No.

1:04:59.530 --> 1:05:00.973
I mean, I looked everywhere.

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:03.780
I don't even know if he's
really bringing the notebook,

1:05:03.780 --> 1:05:05.053
but he did say he'd talk.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:08.570
It's immunity for us both, yeah?

1:05:12.505 --> 1:05:13.423
That was your word.

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:17.313
- Yeah, you're both doing the right thing.

1:05:29.097 --> 1:05:30.097
- Don't go anywhere.

1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:33.413
Delaney.

1:05:37.750 --> 1:05:38.583
What?

1:05:41.556 --> 1:05:42.389
You sure?

1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:49.223
Okay thanks.

1:05:55.890 --> 1:05:57.173
That was the FBI.

1:06:00.582 --> 1:06:03.332
They have no record of any
Lydia Kane working for them.

1:06:06.070 --> 1:06:07.573
Congratulations, Alex,

1:06:09.980 --> 1:06:11.657
you just blatantly lied to the DEA,

1:06:11.657 --> 1:06:13.493
that's a federal offense.

1:06:15.362 --> 1:06:18.090
- Just add it to the list.

1:06:18.090 --> 1:06:19.940
- The next words out of your mouth

1:06:19.940 --> 1:06:22.180
better be a thorough
explanation of all this shit

1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:24.570
you lied to me about and
what you specifically

1:06:24.570 --> 1:06:25.523
meant to tell me.

1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:29.090
- I'd like to speak to an attorney.

1:06:29.090 --> 1:06:34.090
- Well, 20 years minimum for
lying to a federal agent.

1:06:36.230 --> 1:06:40.663
Obviously, the deal is off
because I can't trust you.

1:06:42.990 --> 1:06:45.993
That's intent to distribute, the assault,

1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:48.920
you're looking at a lot of time, Alex.

1:06:51.556 --> 1:06:54.223
Now, I can still help you if you

1:06:56.057 --> 1:06:58.607
end this bullshit and give up Lester.

1:06:59.827 --> 1:07:01.993
- How do I know you're not lying to me?

1:07:05.477 --> 1:07:06.477
- You don't.

1:07:11.469 --> 1:07:13.663
Explain, no games.

1:07:28.370 --> 1:07:30.143
- You have to promise you'll let me go.

1:07:32.055 --> 1:07:34.210
- It's like that now.

1:07:34.210 --> 1:07:35.060
- Just like that.

1:07:37.381 --> 1:07:38.923
You want Lester, right?

1:07:41.070 --> 1:07:42.920
- I'm giving you a chance here, Alex.

1:07:44.700 --> 1:07:48.083
You lie to me again, you'll
end up just like your mom.

1:07:54.482 --> 1:07:56.633
- It's the longitude and
latitude of the location.

1:07:58.060 --> 1:07:59.710
There's no address to this place.

1:08:01.670 --> 1:08:02.770
You'll find him there.

1:08:37.443 --> 1:08:38.943
- Get out of here.

1:08:41.057 --> 1:08:42.057
- That easy?

1:08:44.107 --> 1:08:45.684
- And I need your car.

1:08:45.684 --> 1:08:47.684
I'll find ya, I promise.

1:09:04.026 --> 1:09:04.943
- It's bad.

1:09:07.755 --> 1:09:09.190
- What the fuck you doing, arrest him!

1:09:09.190 --> 1:09:10.320
- You idiot!

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:12.173
- Pretty boy, get in the car.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:14.633
Hurry up.

1:09:22.930 --> 1:09:23.763
Drive.

1:10:03.321 --> 1:10:04.680
- DEA!

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:07.063
Lay down your shovel, get
your hands in the air!

1:10:08.970 --> 1:10:09.803
Atta boy.

1:10:10.850 --> 1:10:11.973
Oh, hello, old friend.

1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:14.603
- Go fuck yourself.

1:10:16.370 --> 1:10:17.403
You bring Alex?

1:10:18.283 --> 1:10:19.383
- Oh, very impressive.

1:10:20.890 --> 1:10:21.773
Why use the boy?

1:10:23.038 --> 1:10:24.960
You could have found me on your own.

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:26.603
- 'Cause this was too much fun.

1:10:28.420 --> 1:10:32.373
- You forget, I bring friends.

1:10:33.407 --> 1:10:34.843
- Yeah, you always do it.

1:10:37.531 --> 1:10:40.313
- Well, if it isn't Mr. Loco, himself.

1:10:41.900 --> 1:10:42.950
- What the fuck?

1:10:42.950 --> 1:10:45.270
- It's nice to finally meet you.

1:10:45.270 --> 1:10:46.740
Especially after spending so much time

1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:48.570
sampling your fine ass product.

1:10:48.570 --> 1:10:52.083
- Very clever, try to
lure me out here, alone.

1:10:53.330 --> 1:10:55.510
But I'm always two steps ahead.

1:10:55.510 --> 1:10:57.347
And this little fucking bitch

1:10:58.928 --> 1:11:01.690
has been delivering us
Loco for fucking weeks.

1:11:01.690 --> 1:11:03.744
- It's not like your little
samples did shit for--

1:11:05.810 --> 1:11:08.560
- Things are about to get complicated.

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:09.530
- Lester!

1:11:09.530 --> 1:11:10.940
- Put your fucking gun down.

1:11:10.940 --> 1:11:12.420
- I'm not doing shit.

1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:15.545
- Put your fucking down or
I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

1:11:15.545 --> 1:11:16.410
What the fuck is this?

1:11:16.410 --> 1:11:18.203
- What the the fuck is this?

1:11:18.203 --> 1:11:20.710
I've been working for him
since I fucking took out

1:11:20.710 --> 1:11:22.570
the distributor of Loco.

1:11:22.570 --> 1:11:24.850
That fucking punk got killed for spitting

1:11:24.850 --> 1:11:28.240
on my fucking long shoes and
somebody else needed to step in

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.380
and make the fucking money!

1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:32.670
Whole town is fucking sick of you.

1:11:32.670 --> 1:11:34.707
Now put the fucking gun down now!

1:11:44.359 --> 1:11:45.990
- After all the shit I did for you.

1:11:45.990 --> 1:11:48.410
- Look, this is fucking business.

1:11:48.410 --> 1:11:49.960
Don't get all emotional on me.

1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:52.080
You give me what, 10% cent percent?

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:54.960
He gives me 30%.

1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:57.453
Excuse me, step up.

1:11:58.430 --> 1:11:59.933
Look at me, look at me.

1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:01.993
Look at me!

1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:05.160
He's a good boss and you
were going to give him up

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:05.993
just like that?

1:12:05.993 --> 1:12:07.350
- Get the fuck off her!

1:12:07.350 --> 1:12:09.763
- Get the fuck back,
pretty boy, step back!

1:12:13.690 --> 1:12:15.843
I been waiting
for this for a long time.

1:12:17.067 --> 1:12:19.740
- So what are you going to do, kill me?

1:12:19.740 --> 1:12:22.103
Finally get your little
payback, hey, princess?

1:12:23.330 --> 1:12:28.330
- No, Talome, that would be too easy.

1:12:29.070 --> 1:12:30.720
- Why won't you just let her die?

1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:34.630
Oh, you preoccupation
with your little fucking

1:12:34.630 --> 1:12:36.203
precious wonder drug.

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:39.840
I was teaching you a lesson.

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:43.550
Your call.

1:12:43.550 --> 1:12:46.273
- She was my everything
and you took it all away

1:12:46.273 --> 1:12:51.273
and I thought to myself, what
could equal that pain, right?

1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:54.470
So I stole your clients,

1:12:54.470 --> 1:12:56.147
I bought your boys out from under you,

1:12:56.147 --> 1:12:58.733
but I saved the best thing for last.

1:13:01.190 --> 1:13:03.253
Say hello to your daddy, Alex.

1:13:08.410 --> 1:13:11.510
- Very good, very,
very, very fucking good!

1:13:11.510 --> 1:13:13.000
Yeah, good old Lester.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.770
That's the Lester I remember.

1:13:14.770 --> 1:13:16.570
- Lester, you gotta tell
me what's going on, I--

1:13:16.570 --> 1:13:18.570
- You think I give a fuck?

1:13:18.570 --> 1:13:21.653
- No, I don't think
you'd give a fuck at all.

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:25.801
You don't even care about
your own flesh and blood.

1:13:38.866 --> 1:13:41.699
Point the gun at your son's chest.

1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:43.993
Now.

1:13:46.752 --> 1:13:48.919
- Talome, this whole time.

1:13:50.630 --> 1:13:53.943
- Yeah, the shadow master, devil himself.

1:13:55.131 --> 1:13:56.840
- If I kill this little fucking prick

1:13:58.610 --> 1:14:00.503
how do I know you're not gonna kill me?

1:14:01.647 --> 1:14:03.078
Lester, please.

1:14:03.078 --> 1:14:03.920
- Shh.

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:04.753
You don't.

1:14:05.950 --> 1:14:08.480
I figure a drug lord knee deep in the DEA

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.163
that kills his own son, now whoa,

1:14:11.087 --> 1:14:12.437
that's a pretty good story.

1:14:13.290 --> 1:14:16.220
A great legacy, great Talome!

1:14:16.220 --> 1:14:17.940
Completely erased.

1:14:17.940 --> 1:14:22.583
Now aim the gun at your
fucking son's chest.

1:14:32.158 --> 1:14:33.463
- Why don't you fucking shoot me?

1:14:34.756 --> 1:14:35.806
You're not my father.

1:14:36.810 --> 1:14:38.260
- Give you a mom a kiss, kid.

1:14:40.998 --> 1:14:42.248
Lester, Lester!

1:14:44.601 --> 1:14:45.851
- You kill him.

1:14:46.810 --> 1:14:48.424
Five.

1:14:48.424 --> 1:14:49.540
- You don't think I can fucking do it?

1:14:49.540 --> 1:14:50.895
- Four.

1:14:50.895 --> 1:14:52.228
- Lester please!

1:14:59.302 --> 1:15:00.653
- You fucking scumbag!

1:15:43.070 --> 1:15:44.053
Put the gun down.

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:50.393
It's just between him and me.

1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:01.350
- What now?

1:16:01.350 --> 1:16:03.370
We buried these bodies.

1:16:03.370 --> 1:16:05.963
We get back to business as usual.

1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:09.357
You in or out?

1:16:17.134 --> 1:16:18.467
- We're leaving.

1:16:20.504 --> 1:16:21.904
- I'm not going to stop you.

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:25.393
We never met, you understand?

1:16:30.510 --> 1:16:32.913
Don't hurt that girl, you hear me?

1:17:09.587 --> 1:17:10.420
- Joey.

1:17:55.434 --> 1:17:56.739
- Son of a--

1:18:00.222 --> 1:18:02.185
and I pick out a bitch

1:18:07.901 --> 1:18:10.127
flash them a bitch

1:18:15.849 --> 1:18:17.927
I pick out a bitch
