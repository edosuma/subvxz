23:57.834 --> 23:59.083
ALL AFTERNOON.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.750
- OH, YEAH, GUESS WHAT.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.166
SO ARE YOU.

24:03.166 --> 24:05.417
- JUST UNSEALED THE JUVEY
RECORDS OF JOHNNY ROSE,

24:05.417 --> 24:07.083
OUR VACATION MURDER SUSPECT.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.625
- ANYTHING?

24:08.625 --> 24:11.542
- SHOPLIFTING WITH HIS HIGH
SCHOOL GIRLFRIEND, NIKKI WALD.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.417
- THAT WAS LIKE, WHAT,
TEN YEARS AGO?

24:14.417 --> 24:15.750
YOU THINK THEY'RE
STILL IN TOUCH?

24:15.750 --> 24:17.542
- SINCE SHE TESTIFIED
AGAINST HIM BACK THEN,

24:17.542 --> 24:19.417
I'D SAY EXTREMELY UNLIKELY.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.875
- WELL, AT THIS POINT, I THINK
WE NEED TO TAKE ANY SHOT WE CAN.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.667
- SHE LIVES IN OAKLAND PARK.
I'LL DRIVE OUT THERE WITH YOU.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.500
- LET'S GO.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.959
- THAT SEEM ACCIDENTAL
AND UNPLANNED TO YOU?

24:33.959 --> 24:36.125
- EVEN I BELIEVED IT.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.792
- I WAS THINKING WE COULD STOP
SOMEWHERE FOR LUNCH FIRST.

24:38.792 --> 24:43.208
- I KNOW A LITTLE PLACE WHERE
WE CAN ORDER SOME ROOM SERVICE.

24:43.208 --> 24:46.417
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
30 YEARS AGO TO THE WEEK.

24:46.417 --> 24:50.291
FEMALE, CAUCASIAN, 36,
MOTHER OF TWO.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.667
JUMPED TO HER DEATH
OFF THE SAME WAREHOUSE.

24:52.667 --> 24:55.291
THE WOMAN'S FAMILY INSISTED
SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF FOUL PLAY,

24:55.291 --> 24:57.583
BUT IT WAS RULED A SUICIDE.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.166
- DOESN'T MEAN FUCK-ALL.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.500
SOMEONE FELL OR JUMPED OFF

25:00.500 --> 25:02.583
THE SAME WAREHOUSE
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

25:02.583 --> 25:05.041
SOMEONE ELSE JUMPED OFF
A SHIP LOADING CRANE

25:05.041 --> 25:06.834
ON THE SAME PIER
BACK IN '86,

25:06.834 --> 25:09.333
AND ANOTHER BODY
WASHED UP ON THE ROCKS

25:09.333 --> 25:12.083
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE
ONLY TWO YEARS AGO.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.583
NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT GOT THERE.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.583
THIS IS MIAMI, DEB.
PEOPLE DIE.

25:15.583 --> 25:19.000
- AND SOMETIMES IT'S BY MURDER.
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.166
- OKAY, TARLA GRANT SEEMED
TO HAVE A PRETTY DECENT LIFE.

25:22.166 --> 25:25.166
NO APPARENT REASON FOR SUICIDE,
SO KEEP IT OPEN FOR NOW.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.333
- FUCKIN' A
WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN.

25:27.333 --> 25:30.208
- I'D KNOW
THAT FOUL MOUTH ANYWHERE.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.500
- ANTON, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.959
- I LOVE YOU TOO, BABY.

25:33.959 --> 25:35.291
COME ON,
LET'S HAVE SOME LUNCH.

25:35.291 --> 25:36.667
- I HAVE A FUCKLOAD
OF WORK TO DO.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.000
ALL RIGHT.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.375
ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT'S A WORKING LUNCH.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.750
- AH, SOLITUDE.

25:48.750 --> 25:51.667
SOMETHING I WON'T ENJOY AGAIN
UNTIL I DEAL WITH JESSE,

25:51.667 --> 25:53.583
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SHITHEAD.

25:57.375 --> 26:00.166
- HEY, DEXTER.
- HEY.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.417
- DEXTER,
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.583
HELLO, DEBRA.

26:04.583 --> 26:07.500
- HI.
- MAY I?

26:07.500 --> 26:11.250
- YEAH.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.625
- FRANK LUNDY.

26:12.625 --> 26:13.625
- ANTON BRIGGS.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.250
- MY LOVER--

26:16.250 --> 26:18.166
FRIEND.
MY BOYFRIEND.

26:18.166 --> 26:21.250
- ALL OF THE ABOVE.

26:21.250 --> 26:23.875
- SO, DEXTER, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D GOTTEN

26:23.875 --> 26:27.166
THE BLOOD TOX RESULTS BACK
ON TARLA GRANT YET?

26:27.166 --> 26:29.250
- YEAH, I SHOULD CHECK
ON THAT RIGHT AWAY.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.083
- PLEASE, FINISH YOUR LUNCH.

26:31.083 --> 26:33.917
- ALL DONE.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.250
- TARLA GRANT, JUST LIKE
YOU SAID: 36 YEARS OLD,

26:38.250 --> 26:39.875
MARRIED, MOTHER OF TWO.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.208
- THAT'S A SHAME.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.166
- I FOUND THE MATCHING
30-YEAR-OLD CASE.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.750
- WHAT'S THAT?

26:45.750 --> 26:47.834
- BIG CASE WE'RE WORKING ON.

26:47.834 --> 26:51.291
- I'M AFRAID I'VE ENLISTED DEBRA
IN ANOTHER OF MY MAD THEORIES.

26:51.291 --> 26:54.583
- AH.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.959
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?

26:55.959 --> 26:58.875
- FINDING OUT WHO KILLED HER.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.083
- OH.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.291
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAPPENED
TO BRING THE, UH--

27:03.291 --> 27:06.000
- 30-YEAR-OLD FILE?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.667
READ THE HUSBAND'S STATEMENT
FROM 30 YEARS AGO.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.792
FAMILY NEVER BELIEVED
IT WAS A SUICIDE.

27:11.792 --> 27:14.291
- BUT SINCE TRINITY
NEVER LEAVES A TRACE,

27:14.291 --> 27:17.417
THERE WAS NOTHING
TO INVESTIGATE.

27:21.291 --> 27:25.125
- YOU GIVE
GOOD ROOM SERVICE, ANGEL.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.291
- YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
DO LUNCH OUT MORE OFTEN.

27:27.291 --> 27:31.000
- MISSED ONE.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.625
[giggles]

27:33.625 --> 27:35.583
- NO ARRESTS
SINCE SHE GOT BUSTED

27:35.583 --> 27:36.959
WITH ROSE
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.709
SPOTTY JOB RECORD,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.250
- IT'S A STRETCH, I KNOW.

27:44.333 --> 27:47.583
[knock on door]

27:47.583 --> 27:48.834
NIKKI?

27:52.083 --> 27:54.000
NIKKI WALD?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.875
I'M NOT SURE
MISS NIKKI WALD IS HOME.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.458
- OKAY.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.166
HEY, I'M SERGEANT BATISTA
FROM MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.208
- IT'S ROSE.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.000
- GET DOWN!

28:08.000 --> 28:13.917
[gunshots]

28:13.917 --> 28:16.333
SHOTS FIRED, 41ST AND ANDREWS.
WE NEED BACKUP!

28:16.333 --> 28:17.792
GOOD?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD, LET'S GO.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.834
- SUSPECTS JOHNNY ROSE
AND NIKKI WALD GOING NORTHBOUND

28:29.834 --> 28:32.417
ON 41ST STREET
IN A WHITE SEDAN.

28:32.417 --> 28:34.208
- I THINK IT WAS GRAY.
- A LIGHT-COLORED SEDAN.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.542
MAKE? MODEL?

28:35.542 --> 28:38.500
- SUSPECTS ARE
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.875
- RITA THINKS I'M WITH
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.792
TRUTH IS, I'M GONNA DO
A LITTLE MORE THAN WATCH.

28:50.792 --> 28:55.250
THERE'S DAD,
OFF TO HIS WEEKLY POKER GAME.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.500
[car ignition starts]

29:01.041 --> 29:04.375
AND IF I WERE
THE DELINQUENT SON,

29:04.375 --> 29:07.875
I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY FATHER'S ABSENCE.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.917
GOING AFTER HIM
FEELS VERY FAMILIAR,

29:11.917 --> 29:15.250
EXCEPT IT WON'T HAVE
ITS USUAL SATISFYING ENDING.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.458
THE BEST I CAN DO IS SCARE
A LITTLE SENSE INTO THIS KID.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.417
- HEY!

29:27.417 --> 29:28.834
COME ON, IT'S THE VANDAL.
LET'S GET HIM!

29:28.834 --> 29:31.959
- OH, FUCK.

29:41.625 --> 29:43.750
IT'S WATCH AND REPORT,
ASSHOLES.

29:43.750 --> 29:46.458
NOT WATCH AND CHASE.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.542
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.959
- GO THAT WAY.

30:22.458 --> 30:25.166
- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S
GONNA KILL ME.

30:31.959 --> 30:33.709
- ALREADY? I MEAN, THE KIDS
AREN'T EVEN DRESSED YET.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.041
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M EARLY.

30:35.041 --> 30:38.333
JUST WANTED YOU TO SEE
THE LATEST WORK OF THE VANDAL.

30:41.792 --> 30:43.208
HAPPENED IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.917
HE OBVIOUSLY SMASHED THE WINDOW,
RELEASED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE,

30:46.917 --> 30:50.208
GAVE IT A SHOVE,
AND, UH, LET IT ROLL.

30:50.208 --> 30:51.834
- SO DANGEROUS.

30:51.834 --> 30:54.375
- IS THAT CODY'S BIKE?

30:54.375 --> 30:55.834
- OH, MY GOD.

30:55.834 --> 30:58.125
WHAT IF HE HAD BEEN
OUT HERE PLAYING?

31:07.834 --> 31:10.583
- THESE DUMMIES SHARE THE SAME
SIZE AND WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION

31:10.583 --> 31:12.000
AS OUR VICTIM.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
AT THIS HEIGHT,
ANY VARIANT IN TRAJECTORY

31:15.000 --> 31:17.875
RESULTING FROM A SIMPLE JUMP
OR BEING PUSHED OFF THE BUILDING

31:17.875 --> 31:19.792
WILL BE EVIDENT
IN WHERE THEY LAND.

31:19.792 --> 31:23.333
- WHAT IF SHE TOOK
A RUNNING LEAP?

31:23.333 --> 31:25.000
- PEOPLE DON'T KILL
THEMSELVES THAT WAY.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.250
THEY JUST LET GO.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.500
OH, HEY, EITHER OF YOU
INTERESTED IN BUYING TICKETS

31:29.500 --> 31:30.834
TO THE DOLPHINS GAME?
CLUB LEVEL?

31:30.834 --> 31:32.000
I'LL LET THEM GO
FOR 500 BUCKS.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.542
- WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE?
- DEXTER.

31:33.542 --> 31:34.834
- SON OF A BITCH.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.667
- COME ON,
WE HAVE DUMMIES TO DROP.

31:36.667 --> 31:40.583
- IS HE GONNA PAY ME
FOR THOSE?

31:40.583 --> 31:42.458
MUST BE WEIRD FOR YOU--

31:42.458 --> 31:43.959
LUNDY COMING BACK.

31:43.959 --> 31:45.750
- WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?
YOU'RE WEIRD.

31:45.750 --> 31:47.667
- NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
I KNOW.

31:47.667 --> 31:51.625
BUT...IF I LOVED SOMEONE,

31:51.625 --> 31:53.375
AND THAT PERSON WAS GONE,

31:53.375 --> 31:55.709
AND THEN I MOVED ON,
AND THEN FOUND SOMEONE ELSE,

31:55.709 --> 31:57.875
AND THEN THAT FIRST PERSON
ALL OF A SUDDEN SHOWED UP AGAIN,

31:57.875 --> 32:01.000
I DON'T KNOW--
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.750
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE
A LITTLE CONFUSING.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.709
- MAYBE.

32:06.709 --> 32:09.041
A LITTLE.

32:09.041 --> 32:10.959
- SO THEN MAYBE IF YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

32:10.959 --> 32:12.291
WEIRD AND CONFUSING,

32:12.291 --> 32:14.583
THEN MAYBE IT'S
A LITTLE EASIER TO HANDLE.

32:14.583 --> 32:17.834
- THANKS.

32:17.834 --> 32:20.667
- IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
THREE KILLS WITH TRINITY--

32:20.667 --> 32:23.583
A YOUNG WOMAN IN A BATHTUB,

32:23.583 --> 32:27.083
FOLLOWED BY A MOTHER
FALLING TO HER DEATH,

32:27.083 --> 32:29.834
AND ENDING WITH A MAN
GETTING BLUDGEONED.

32:29.834 --> 32:32.583
- I PUT HER IN A SHORT SHIRT
SO THAT WE CAN SEE HER PANTIES

32:32.583 --> 32:35.041
WHILE SHE'S FALLING.

32:37.917 --> 32:39.959
- SPECIFIC.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.333
HOW MANY TIMES
THAT YOU KNOW OF?

32:44.333 --> 32:46.458
- I'VE GOT
THE BITS AND PIECES

32:46.458 --> 32:49.333
THAT ADD UP
TO AT LEAST 15 CYCLES.

32:49.333 --> 32:53.333
SINCE WE JUST TURNED THE CLOCK
BACK ANOTHER 15 YEARS,

32:53.333 --> 32:56.333
I'M SURE THERE ARE
CONSIDERABLY MORE.

32:56.333 --> 32:59.583
- WOW.

32:59.583 --> 33:01.083
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.083
IN A VERY EVIL WAY.

33:08.959 --> 33:12.959
- WHAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE
IS THAT I CAN'T PROVE A THING.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.792
COULD NEVER GET ANYONE
AT THE BUREAU CONVINCED.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.000
HE'S THAT GOOD.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.834
- WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'S SO SUCCESSFUL?

33:18.834 --> 33:23.250
- TRINITY'S LIKELY SOMEONE
WHO'S GONE HIS OWN SOLITARY WAY

33:23.250 --> 33:24.792
THROUGH LIFE,

33:24.792 --> 33:26.834
SO PREOCCUPIED
WITH HIS OWN OBSESSIONS

33:26.834 --> 33:30.333
THAT HE'S FOREGONE ALL BUT
THE MOST RUDIMENTARY

33:30.333 --> 33:32.500
OF HUMAN CONNECTIONS.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.125
- A LONE WOLF.

33:35.125 --> 33:36.542
- EXACTLY.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.291
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING.

33:40.291 --> 33:41.667
- YEAH.

33:41.667 --> 33:44.041
- I MEAN...
I COULD JUST AS WELL

33:44.041 --> 33:47.500
BE TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.166
SURE, I'VE BEEN MARRIED.

33:49.166 --> 33:52.709
WAS MARRIED FOR 29 YEARS,
HAPPILY.

33:52.709 --> 33:54.959
BUT EVEN SO,

33:54.959 --> 33:58.375
THE ONLY THING THAT
REALLY GOT MY HEART BEATING

33:58.375 --> 34:00.291
WAS THE HUNT.

34:00.291 --> 34:01.834
I'M SURE YOU CAN'T RELATE.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.750
- NO, SORRY.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.959
- AND NOW HERE I AM AT 60,

34:07.959 --> 34:10.458
WATCHING DUMMIES
FLY OFF A ROOF,

34:10.458 --> 34:13.583
STILL ON THE HUNT.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.959
- IT SOUNDS LIKE TRINITY
IS WORTHY PREY.

34:15.959 --> 34:18.667
- WHAT'S REALLY
GOT ME INTRIGUED

34:18.667 --> 34:23.709
IS THE NOTION
THAT HE'S RETURNED TO MIAMI.

34:23.709 --> 34:26.291
- HE'S COME HOME.

34:26.291 --> 34:30.333
- I'M NOT SURE "HOME"
IS THE RIGHT WORD.

34:30.333 --> 34:34.542
PEOPLE LIKE US
DON'T REALLY BELONG ANYWHERE.

34:34.542 --> 34:37.709
WE JUST PASS THROUGH.

35:45.792 --> 35:47.250
- DRINK UP.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.250
YOU'RE NEXT.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.500
- THE VACATION MURDERS.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.458
WORD IS, YOU KNOW WHO
JOHNNY ROSE'S ACCOMPLICE IS.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.333
- FORGET IT, YOU'LL GET
THE PRESS RELEASE SAME TIME

36:10.333 --> 36:12.000
AS EVERYONE ELSE.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.583
BUT MY SERGEANT AND LIEUTENANT
WERE ALMOST KILLED YESTERDAY,

36:13.583 --> 36:16.583
SO IF YOU PUT ANY NEGATIVE
SPIN ON IT, I'LL BE VERY ANGRY.

36:16.583 --> 36:19.166
- WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY,
YOU'RE VERY SEXY,

36:19.166 --> 36:21.959
SO THIS COULD BE
SORT OF A WIN-WIN FOR ME.

36:21.959 --> 36:24.000
- LET'S JUST SAY I'LL BE ANGRY
IN A VERY WITHHOLDING

36:24.000 --> 36:25.208
SORT OF WAY.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.417
- OKAY.

36:26.417 --> 36:29.083
THE BATHTUB MURDER?
- STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.834
- THE JUMPER
AT THE OLD PORT BUILDING?

36:31.834 --> 36:32.959
- DITTO.

36:32.959 --> 36:35.458
I GOTTA RUN.
SEE YOU TONIGHT?

36:35.458 --> 36:36.834
- SURE.

36:36.834 --> 36:38.625
- CAN YOU JUST GO OVER
THE FIGURES ONE MORE TIME?

36:38.625 --> 36:40.291
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.542
THE TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT
TARLA GRANT JUMPED,

36:42.542 --> 36:44.166
RATHER THAN WAS PUSHED.
- I DON'T BUY IT.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.375
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
AT A MURDER VICTIM.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.792
- DEB, WE ALSO GOT
THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.041
SHE HAD A SMALL TUMOR.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.458
TALKED TO THE HUSBAND.
THEY JUST FOUND OUT LAST WEEK.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.709
MAYBE SHE WAS TAKING
THE EASY WAY OUT.

36:53.709 --> 36:56.166
- MAYBE SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO FIGHT IT.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.542
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
SHE KILLED HERSELF.

36:57.542 --> 36:59.166
I CHECKED
HER CELL PHONE RECORDS.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.166
NO TEXT MESSAGES,
NO SUICIDE NOTE.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.875
- NOT EVERYONE LEAVES A NOTE.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.375
- I JUST GOT WORD.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.041
WE WILL BE DEBRIEFED
ON OUR SHOOTING INCIDENT

37:07.041 --> 37:08.417
IN THE MORNING.

37:08.417 --> 37:10.542
- OKAY, GOOD.

37:10.542 --> 37:12.125
- WE NEED TO GET
OUR STORIES STRAIGHT

37:12.125 --> 37:13.542
ABOUT WHY WE LEFT
THE PRECINCT AT 12:30

37:13.542 --> 37:16.750
AND DIDN'T GET TO WALD'S
APARTMENT UNTIL AFTER 3:00.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.875
- WE GRABBED SOME LUNCH
AND THEN WE HAD A FLAT TIRE.

37:19.875 --> 37:22.250
- FLAT TIRE IT IS.

37:22.250 --> 37:24.959
- YOU OKAY?

37:24.959 --> 37:27.083
- I'VE READ MASUKA'S NOTES.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.000
THAT, ALONG WITH
THE AUTOPSY REPORTS,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.625
LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S NO REASON

37:30.625 --> 37:32.875
TO KEEP TARLA'S CASE OPEN
AS A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.583
- LIEUTENANT, I THINK
IT'S PREMATURE TO CLOSE IT.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.417
LUNDY HAS THIS THEORY--
- YOU DON'T WORK FOR LUNDY.

37:37.417 --> 37:40.667
YOU'RE WELCOME TO PURSUE THIS,
BUT BETWEEN THE VACATION MURDERS

37:40.667 --> 37:45.041
AND LISA BELL, I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY BUSY.

37:45.041 --> 37:46.667
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
WITH THIS ONE.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.583
- POOR CODY.

37:48.583 --> 37:52.041
OUCH.

37:52.041 --> 37:53.875
WHERE'D THE GLASS COME FROM?

37:53.875 --> 37:55.083
- THAT CAR ON ELLIOT'S LAWN.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.542
CODY WAS COMING BACK
FROM THEIR POOL,

37:56.542 --> 37:58.667
AND HE STEPPED ON A PIECE.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.417
- DOES HE NEED STITCHES?

38:00.417 --> 38:02.291
- NO, HE'S FINE,
HE'S JUST SCARED.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.250
FIRST HIS BIKE, NOW THIS.

38:04.250 --> 38:07.125
- POOR GUY.
GIVE HIM A HUG FOR ME.

38:11.667 --> 38:12.709
- HI.

38:12.709 --> 38:14.625
HELP ME OUT HERE, DEXTER.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.291
I'VE BEEN GOING OUT OF MY WAY
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS GOOD

38:16.291 --> 38:17.750
WITH YOU,
BUT NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

38:17.750 --> 38:19.959
YOU JUST THROW IT BACK
IN MY FACE.

38:19.959 --> 38:23.375
- YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE
THINGS GOOD WITH ME.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.959
- COME ON,
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?

38:25.959 --> 38:28.625
- QUINN...

38:28.625 --> 38:31.500
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE A DIRTY COP.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.375
- IF I DIDN'T TAKE THAT MONEY,
IT WOULD JUST SIT

38:35.375 --> 38:36.959
INSIDE A LOCKER
UNTIL SOME FATASS

38:36.959 --> 38:39.125
WHO SITS BEHIND A DESK
GRABS IT TO BUY NEW CARPET

38:39.125 --> 38:40.709
FOR HIS OFFICE
WHICH HE NEVER LEAVES.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.291
I PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE
EVERY DAY.

38:42.291 --> 38:44.250
I GIVE THIS JOB
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT,

38:44.250 --> 38:46.291
AND I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
A DOWN PAYMENT ON A CONDO.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.500
- I THOUGHT
YOU HAD FAMILY MONEY.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.166
- HAD, AND THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

38:50.166 --> 38:52.375
JUST DON'T
FUCKING CALL ME DIRTY.

38:52.375 --> 38:54.458
- THE LAST THING I NEED
IS A COP MAD AT ME.

38:58.166 --> 39:02.750
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I TAKE IT ALL BACK.

39:02.750 --> 39:07.166
I HONESTLY
DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

39:07.166 --> 39:10.458
JUST KEEP MY SISTER
OUT OF IT, OKAY?

39:12.500 --> 39:15.834
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS, DO YOU?

39:15.834 --> 39:18.917
YOU CAN'T,

39:18.917 --> 39:22.583
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT A COP.

39:22.583 --> 39:24.625
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.834
- [sigh]

39:25.834 --> 39:28.333
COPS: ANOTHER COMMUNITY
I'M NOT PART OF.

39:43.792 --> 39:45.583
[exhales]

39:47.875 --> 39:50.125
- WHAT?

39:50.125 --> 39:52.875
- IT'S SO CROWDED IN THERE.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.375
- WELL, I GUESS SO.
A WIFE AND THREE KIDS.

39:59.041 --> 40:01.041
- THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.375
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.917
IT WAS EASY LIVING WITH ANTON
WHEN HE WAS NEVER HOME.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.959
I'D COME BACK
TO A QUIET APARTMENT

40:08.959 --> 40:11.500
AND UNWIND WITHOUT HAVING
TO DEAL WITH ANYBODY.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
NOW, AS SOON AS I WALK
THROUGH THE DOOR, HE'S THERE,

40:13.500 --> 40:15.083
WAITING TO ENGAGE.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.583
- THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

40:16.583 --> 40:21.458
- AND NOW LUNDY SHOWS UP.

40:21.458 --> 40:25.250
- IS THAT GOOD OR BAD?

40:25.250 --> 40:28.792
- I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE.

40:28.792 --> 40:32.583
[giggles]
- WHAT?

40:32.583 --> 40:35.375
- WE'RE COMPLAINING BECAUSE
PEOPLE WANT TO BE WITH US?

40:35.375 --> 40:38.250
HOW LAME IS THAT?

40:38.250 --> 40:41.917
YOU THINK TARLA GRANT
KILLED HERSELF?

40:41.917 --> 40:45.959
- NO, I DON'T.

40:45.959 --> 40:50.041
- MASUKA SAID SHE WASN'T THROWN
OR PUSHED FROM THE BUILDING.

40:50.041 --> 40:55.041
SHE JUMPED.
WHAT WOULD MAKE HER DO THAT?

40:55.041 --> 40:57.917
- FEAR IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR.

41:03.458 --> 41:05.458
- YOU SHOULD GO INSIDE.
YOU'RE HOME.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.333
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.000
- HI.
- HI, SWEETIE.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.125
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

41:21.125 --> 41:22.834
- I'M IN HERE.

41:22.834 --> 41:24.750
- FORT CODY.

41:29.333 --> 41:31.959
- HEY, BUDDY,
HOW'S YOUR FOOT?

41:31.959 --> 41:33.417
- IT'S BETTER.

41:33.417 --> 41:37.291
- GOOD.
KEEP HOLDING DOWN THE FORT.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.834
- OKAY.

41:38.834 --> 41:41.291
- AND I'LL
TAKE CARE OF MY END

41:41.291 --> 41:43.500
ONCE YOU GUYS
GO TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.834
- YOU MAY WANT
TO TALK TO ASTOR.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.125
- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
WHEN I WISH

41:51.125 --> 41:52.875
I WAS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

41:52.875 --> 41:55.792
I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

42:02.417 --> 42:03.500
HEY.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.709
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.

42:12.709 --> 42:15.041
- DUH.

42:15.041 --> 42:17.000
- I'M SORRY.

42:18.709 --> 42:21.083
IT'S JUST...

42:21.083 --> 42:25.041
SOMETIMES I'M...

42:25.041 --> 42:26.875
DUMB.

42:34.041 --> 42:37.709
- IT'S OKAY.

42:37.709 --> 42:40.542
YOU CAN BE DUMB.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.166
- [sighs]
THANKS.

43:04.792 --> 43:06.625
- WHAT?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
- IT'S FUNNY.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.750
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
AFTER A SHOOT-UP LIKE THIS,

43:14.750 --> 43:16.959
PEOPLE SAW ME
LEANING AGAINST YOU,

43:16.959 --> 43:18.250
THEY WOULDN'T THINK TWICE.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.250
- THEY STILL
WOULDN'T THINK TWICE.

43:20.250 --> 43:21.917
THEY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT US.

43:21.917 --> 43:24.542
- I KNOW.

43:24.542 --> 43:26.792
BUT I THINK TWICE.

43:26.792 --> 43:31.041
I'M CONSTANTLY WORRIED THAT
PEOPLE WILL MISINTERPRET.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.542
- LET THEM MISINTERPRET.

43:42.959 --> 43:45.875
HEY...

43:45.875 --> 43:47.875
I NEED THIS
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

43:52.458 --> 43:53.625
- THIS DEXTER GUY.

43:53.625 --> 43:56.291
FIRST OF ALL, WHO THE FUCK
IS NAMED DEXTER?

43:56.291 --> 43:58.417
- [groaning]

43:58.417 --> 44:00.792
- OH, THAT FEELS GOOD.

44:00.792 --> 44:03.166
WHAT, DID HIS PARENTS KNOW
HE WAS GONNA GROW UP

44:03.166 --> 44:05.458
TO BE A FUCKING EGGHEAD?

44:05.458 --> 44:08.125
- I MET HIM.
HE SEEMS OKAY.

44:08.125 --> 44:10.625
- HE'S A LAB GEEK.

44:10.625 --> 44:13.667
FUCK, THAT FEELS GOOD.

44:13.667 --> 44:15.792
- WHAT ELSE?

44:15.792 --> 44:19.458
- WHAT ELSE?
I'M EXHAUSTED.

44:19.458 --> 44:22.458
I SPENT ALL AFTERNOON
IN THE SUN

44:22.458 --> 44:25.208
THROWING DUMMIES
OFF A WAREHOUSE,

44:25.208 --> 44:29.041
'CAUSE SUPER AGENT LUNDY
HAS A HUNCH THAT

44:29.041 --> 44:32.834
THE DEAD WOMAN IS CONNECTED
TO THIS BIG SERIAL KILLER CASE.

44:32.834 --> 44:33.959
- HMM, REALLY?

44:33.959 --> 44:38.458
- OH, YEAH.
LUNDY ALWAYS GETS HIS MAN.

44:38.458 --> 44:42.166
- YEAH?

44:42.166 --> 44:44.000
WELL, SO DO I.

44:49.458 --> 44:51.834
- THIS IS WHERE
I FIRST NOTICED THE PATTERN.

44:51.834 --> 44:54.208
RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, 1993.

44:54.208 --> 44:56.458
- THAT GOT YOU CURIOUS?

44:56.458 --> 44:59.333
- THEN I FOUND
SAN FRANCISCO, LOUISVILLE,

44:59.333 --> 45:01.709
DETROIT, RICHMOND.

45:01.709 --> 45:04.792
EIGHT DIFFERENT CITIES IN ALL
THAT I KNOW OF.

45:04.792 --> 45:07.500
NEVER THE SAME PLACE TWICE.

45:07.500 --> 45:11.166
UNTIL NOW.

45:11.166 --> 45:13.208
READY FOR ANOTHER?

45:13.208 --> 45:15.709
- OH. YEAH.

45:19.083 --> 45:22.041
SO NOW THIS IS YOUR
LITTLE RETIREMENT PROJECT?

45:22.041 --> 45:25.834
YOU'RE COMPLETELY INCAPABLE
OF RELAXING, AREN'T YOU?

45:25.834 --> 45:28.709
- THAT'S JUST IT.
THIS IS HOW I RELAX.

45:28.709 --> 45:29.959
I GET THE SCENT OF A BAD GUY,

45:29.959 --> 45:32.709
I CAN FEEL
MY BLOOD PRESSURE GO DOWN.

45:32.709 --> 45:34.166
- AND HERE I THOUGHT
I WAS BAD.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.875
- YOU ARE.

45:36.875 --> 45:40.083
YOU'RE EXACTLY
THE SAME AS ME,

45:40.083 --> 45:44.417
JUST IN
A MUCH PRETTIER PACKAGE.

45:44.417 --> 45:47.000
- ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH ME,
AGENT LUNDY?

45:48.375 --> 45:52.208
- SIMPLY STATING THE TRUTH,
MISS.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.875
[phone vibrates]

46:04.125 --> 46:05.250
- THANK YOU.

46:05.250 --> 46:08.500
[cell phone rings]

46:08.500 --> 46:10.291
EXCUSE ME JUST A SECOND.

46:12.417 --> 46:13.750
HEY.

46:13.750 --> 46:21.208
- HEY, SO YOU WANT ME
TO ORDER SOME TAKEOUT?

46:21.208 --> 46:23.208
SO I'LL JUST
GRAB SOMETHING HERE.

46:23.208 --> 46:27.125
- OKAY, WELL,
I LOVE YOU, BABE.

46:27.125 --> 46:29.959
- ME TOO.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.709
[glass shatters,
car alarm blaring]

46:43.709 --> 46:47.250
- AH, JESSE, HARD AT WORK.
BIG SURPRISE.

46:53.166 --> 46:57.125
I'M GONNA WAIT IN YOUR ROOM
AND SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.917
JESSE!

47:08.917 --> 47:10.125
IF YOU'RE IN HERE...

47:22.625 --> 47:23.625
ANDY!

47:23.625 --> 47:25.291
APPARENTLY
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

47:25.291 --> 47:27.041
WHO ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT HE SEEMS.

47:33.458 --> 47:36.417
IS THAT THE WRENCH YOU USE
TO BREAK WINDOWS?

47:36.417 --> 47:38.834
- WHAT THE HECK?
- DON'T MOVE.

47:38.834 --> 47:41.000
- OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO ARE YOU?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.917
- YOU'RE GONNA STOP
BREAKING THINGS,

47:42.917 --> 47:44.667
STOP ROLLING CARS
DOWN THE STREET.

47:44.667 --> 47:47.041
STOP EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

47:47.041 --> 47:49.333
IF YOU SO MUCH AS TOUCH
ANOTHER WINDOW,

47:49.333 --> 47:50.917
I WILL COME BACK HERE,

47:50.917 --> 47:55.041
AND I WILL LEAVE
WITH YOUR HEAD IN A BAG.

47:55.041 --> 47:57.500
I ALREADY HAVE THE BAG.

48:01.875 --> 48:03.333
- FUCK YOU!

48:08.875 --> 48:13.208
LET GO OF ME,
YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!

48:13.208 --> 48:15.250
FUCK!

48:15.250 --> 48:17.166
- YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

48:17.166 --> 48:18.875
- I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT TO FUCKING DO,

48:18.875 --> 48:20.959
PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT.

48:20.959 --> 48:22.959
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THEIR FACES.

48:22.959 --> 48:26.458
THOSE BOXES IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS
WITH THEIR BIG FUCKING

48:26.458 --> 48:28.375
FLAT-SCREEN TVS.

48:28.375 --> 48:31.875
"OH, LOOK AT US, AREN'T WE
SO FUCKING RICH?"

48:31.875 --> 48:33.333
THEY'RE LUCKY
THE ONLY THING I BROKE

48:33.333 --> 48:35.000
WAS THEIR FUCKING WINDOWS.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.834
- AND YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T
BREAK YOUR FUCKING NECK.

48:37.834 --> 48:39.417
IT'S OVER.
- FUCK YOU, IT'S OVER.

48:39.417 --> 48:42.208
[groaning]

48:44.959 --> 48:47.291
- GIVE UP.
- NO!

48:47.291 --> 48:50.709
I PLAYED BY THE RULES
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

48:50.709 --> 48:53.583
AND LOOK WHAT IT GOT ME.

48:53.583 --> 48:56.667
MY WIFE'S DEAD.
I LOST MY JOB.

48:56.667 --> 48:59.750
MY SON HATES ME, AND NOW...

48:59.750 --> 49:02.417
THE BANK WANTS
TO TAKE MY HOUSE AWAY.

49:02.417 --> 49:05.000
SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
MY FUCKING HEAD, YOU TAKE IT.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
- I SAID STOP.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.917
YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK
FOR YOUR SON'S HEAD TOO?

49:08.917 --> 49:10.500
- WHAT? NO!

49:10.500 --> 49:11.709
NOT MY BOY!

49:13.667 --> 49:15.250
IT'S ALL I HAVE!

49:17.875 --> 49:20.875
- YOU'RE GONNA SAVE
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR FAMILY,

49:20.875 --> 49:23.792
SAVE WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOURSELF.

49:23.792 --> 49:26.542
BECAUSE ALL THAT OTHER STUFF

49:26.542 --> 49:29.458
IS OVER.

49:29.458 --> 49:30.750
SAY IT.

49:30.750 --> 49:33.750
- YEAH, IT'S OVER.

49:42.083 --> 49:44.583
- BAD NEWS FOR ANDY
IS HE'S LOST HIS HOUSE.

49:44.583 --> 49:46.875
GOOD NEWS FOR ME IS HE'LL
BE OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

49:46.875 --> 49:48.875
BUT WHY SHOULD I
CARE ABOUT HIM?

49:48.875 --> 49:50.125
IT'S HIS WORLD.

49:50.125 --> 49:52.125
PEOPLE LIKE HIM
MADE IT THIS WAY.

49:52.125 --> 49:54.750
AT LEAST HE HAD
A CHANCE TO BELONG.

50:04.375 --> 50:06.500
- IT'S STILL THERE, DEX.

50:06.500 --> 50:09.291
A STAIN SO DEEP
IT CAN'T BE ERASED.

50:29.166 --> 50:30.750
- [grunts]

50:30.750 --> 50:32.792
[sighs]

50:37.041 --> 50:40.041
