00:09.315 --> 00:11.505
Alien damaged ship,
can you hear me in there?

00:11.833 --> 00:13.340
There's no cause for alarm.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.379
I am Meten of The Green Lantern Corps.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.405
Looks like I just have to cut you out friend.

00:27.556 --> 00:28.321
Wrong.

00:32.997 --> 00:34.561
I am not a friend,

00:35.249 --> 00:37.730
I am rage.
I am vengence.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.742
I am death!

00:57.455 --> 00:59.178
What are you doing Zox?

00:59.502 --> 01:03.331
Don't like it?
Feel free to complain to Atrocitus.

01:03.777 --> 01:05.461
Relax young Razer.

01:05.581 --> 01:08.805
Our master's plan includes ample kills.

01:09.116 --> 01:10.843
Enough even for you.

01:11.136 --> 01:13.025
At this rate, our task will never end.

01:13.326 --> 01:17.780
If we eliminate this one, his Power Ring
will simply seek out a replacement Green Lantern.

01:18.042 --> 01:19.882
The we get to kill that one too.

01:35.844 --> 01:36.728
Yes!

01:37.770 --> 01:41.053
Let's keep the commentary to
vehicle specific, shall we Jordan?

01:41.535 --> 01:46.308
I was boss. That was me expressing my professional
opinion of the prototype's acceleration.

01:49.706 --> 01:53.936
Someone at the FAA is going to read
this transcript Hal, so words might help.

01:54.056 --> 01:56.068
Of course Carol.
My apologies.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.105
Plane go fast. Very fast.
Plane good.

02:04.338 --> 02:05.661
Carol?
Are you all right?

02:05.923 --> 02:09.054
Yeah, we're getting one of our famous
Coast City rumblers.

02:09.305 --> 02:11.917
You concentrate on flying that billion dollar jet!

02:17.101 --> 02:17.784
Uh-oh.

02:59.664 --> 03:01.626
Carol is not going to be happy.

03:02.104 --> 03:04.394
Lets worry about liablity later shall we?!

03:04.690 --> 03:07.369
And concentrate on the fact that
we have a downed pilot!

03:07.489 --> 03:08.845
Sounds like you missed me?

03:09.829 --> 03:11.355
Hal!
Oh thank-

03:11.475 --> 03:14.271
I thought you were dead!
Are you okay? What happened?!

03:14.533 --> 03:16.007
I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:16.473 --> 03:19.594
When the shockwave from that shaker
hit it locked my instruments.

03:19.963 --> 03:22.780
There was nothing I could do,
I had to eject and... Uh!

03:23.167 --> 03:27.319
That bridge came down an hour ago,
and you let me think you were dead all this time?!

03:27.629 --> 03:30.621
Well, I landed in the desert,
I had to hike to the freeway.

03:32.167 --> 03:33.135
Typical...

03:34.720 --> 03:37.211
So, you were worried about me.

03:37.821 --> 03:42.716
You, you're replaceable.
That, was a billion dollar fighter jet!

03:43.146 --> 03:47.401
I'm sorry about what happened to the plane Carol.
But you weren't the only one who was worried.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.136
When I saw how big that quake was, well...

03:50.570 --> 03:53.538
I may be replaceable,
but you're not.

03:54.587 --> 03:55.351
Hal...

03:55.759 --> 03:58.485
I've told you a dozen times
why this will never work.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.946
Tell me again.
Over dinner.

04:03.645 --> 04:05.925
- Not now, no.
- What is it?

04:06.251 --> 04:07.981
Eh, it's-, it's the harddrive.

04:08.101 --> 04:12.496
I left it in the wreckage, if one of your
competitors got a hold of the operating system...

04:13.549 --> 04:14.797
Go get the drive.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.829
I'll pick you up after work.
I promise!

04:22.076 --> 04:24.013
Mind if I ask what this is all about?

04:24.133 --> 04:28.038
Green Lantern of sector 2814,
report immediately to Oa.

04:28.297 --> 04:29.304
Priority one.

04:43.906 --> 04:47.472
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like Oa.

04:50.811 --> 04:52.187
Hal Jordan of Earth.

04:52.802 --> 04:56.637
Salaak, of... some planet whose name
escapes me at the moment.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.881
And Kilowog!
Hey, buddy!

05:01.070 --> 05:02.165
What's going on?

05:02.285 --> 05:06.242
You'll find out soon enough Jordan.
Just keep it professional.

05:06.502 --> 05:10.235
And definitely don't go looking for me
to bail you out this time.

05:11.203 --> 05:13.636
Did I leave the toilet seat up or something?

05:28.165 --> 05:31.742
Hal Jordan of Earth,
Green Lantern of sector 2814.

05:32.004 --> 05:36.985
The viceroy of Demrakk 7 claims that when we
assigned you to police crucial peace negotiations

05:37.105 --> 05:39.111
you punched him, in the face.

05:40.065 --> 05:41.043
Is this true?

05:41.305 --> 05:44.184
No, sir. I punched the viceroy in the stomach.

05:44.304 --> 05:46.706
Then I headbutted him in the face. Sir.

05:47.269 --> 05:52.112
The viceroy was a serious dirtbag using diplomatic
immunity to cover up his slave trafficking ring.

05:52.545 --> 05:58.469
The council should note that Jordans claims have
since been proven true by Demrakks authorities.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.087
That is not the point.

06:00.207 --> 06:04.191
This Lantern clearly seems to revel in exceeding
his authority, ignoring our orders...

06:04.453 --> 06:05.859
...and making his own-

06:09.825 --> 06:11.443
Oh no...

06:15.363 --> 06:17.414
We can argue about my conduct later...

06:17.666 --> 06:19.017
...but right now...

06:19.348 --> 06:20.876
...somewhere out there...

06:21.220 --> 06:22.960
...there's a dead Green Lantern.

06:25.279 --> 06:27.381
Salaak, whose ring is this?

06:29.921 --> 06:31.794
Green Lantern Meten.

06:32.367 --> 06:34.638
Never seen this guy before in my life.

06:34.966 --> 06:37.182
Salaak, display Guardian Space.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.406
There are 3600 sectors in Guardian Space.

06:42.725 --> 06:47.818
For millenia, we have dispatched our Power Rings
to choose a worthy protector of each sector.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.995
You are Green Lantern Corps.

06:50.316 --> 06:51.947
This part we know...

06:52.334 --> 06:55.025
Display homeworld of
Frontier Lantern number ten.

06:55.329 --> 06:56.618
Frontier Lantern?

06:56.880 --> 07:01.208
This is the Guardian Frontier,
the very edge of our territory.

07:01.543 --> 07:05.530
We have seeded Lanterns there,
but they are few and far between.

07:05.840 --> 07:11.254
The vast distance makes contact with
the Frontier Lanterns... sporadic, at best.

07:11.562 --> 07:12.718
Then who trains them?

07:12.980 --> 07:16.888
They receive limited instruction
from their rings. That is all.

07:17.286 --> 07:18.890
What do these light signify?

07:19.152 --> 07:21.974
These are locations where
operatives went offline.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.732
Those Power Rings are currently in search
of new hosts. Or en route back to Oa.

07:26.994 --> 07:28.502
It means they're dead.

07:28.744 --> 07:31.486
That is... unfortunate,
but accurate.

07:31.922 --> 07:33.680
And you just sit there, doing nothing?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.908
You did not even see it fit to inform us
about these Lantern deaths?

07:37.170 --> 07:39.385
There is nothing to be done right now.

07:39.505 --> 07:43.526
Flying at top speed you wouldn't reach
the frontier for 18 months.

07:44.002 --> 07:45.684
We are formulating a plan.

07:46.013 --> 07:47.851
There are Lanterns dying out there!

07:47.971 --> 07:51.256
We need to get out there and stop
who ever is targeting them now!

07:51.518 --> 07:56.271
Let me remind the Green Lantern of Earth that
the Guardians are not on trial here. He is.

07:56.391 --> 07:59.625
Appa Ali Apsa, it has been an eventful session.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.479
Perhaps a period of refreshment is required.

08:02.599 --> 08:05.987
Or as our earthman would say...
A coffee break.

08:09.138 --> 08:12.183
Good call Ganthet.
Another minute and I might've said something...

08:12.303 --> 08:13.602
Incredibly stupid?

08:13.722 --> 08:16.656
Yeah, I think that ship sailed
a long time ago Jordan.

08:16.918 --> 08:19.352
Hey, this ain't the way to the commissary.

08:19.705 --> 08:23.641
Indeed. I thought we might enjoy
taking a more scenic route.

08:29.962 --> 08:31.254
What is that?

08:31.536 --> 08:33.549
Oh, that! Nothing really.

08:33.669 --> 08:37.485
An experimental prototype powered
by the green energy itself.

08:39.524 --> 08:41.933
Holy crud...

08:42.053 --> 08:43.683
How fast?

08:43.996 --> 08:48.697
Well, the interceptor is potentially the
fastest ship ever created by sentient life.

08:48.817 --> 08:49.869
Potentially?

08:49.989 --> 08:53.214
This prototype is so sophisticated
and travels so fast...

08:53.334 --> 08:57.008
...that the nav-computer is an actual
artificial intelligence.

08:58.656 --> 08:59.942
I know that look...

09:00.062 --> 09:02.600
Jordan, this isn't one of your
earthen jet thingies.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.723
Look, I'll take her up and work the bugs out.

09:04.843 --> 09:07.774
Then we'll fly to the frontier and
we'll take care of the Lantern killer.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.799
I doubt that will come to pass.

09:09.919 --> 09:11.417
It is much too risky.

09:11.537 --> 09:14.016
And all Guardians must be in agreement.

09:14.628 --> 09:18.246
Some will doubt the very existence of this...
Lantern killer.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.208
Then why show us this?

09:20.328 --> 09:24.506
I told you my friends.
We're simply taking the scenic route.

09:41.799 --> 09:45.328
A Green Lantern!
Thank God, I thought I would perish here!

09:45.693 --> 09:47.831
Can you put your hand up so I can pull you out?

09:48.093 --> 09:50.699
A little help would be appriciated...

10:04.109 --> 10:06.277
Not so cocky now are you?

10:18.290 --> 10:19.339
Where is he?

10:20.881 --> 10:21.912
We split up.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.342
And this time, shoot sooner!

10:43.356 --> 10:44.346
Identify!

10:44.608 --> 10:47.186
Ganthet of the Guardians.

10:47.861 --> 10:51.311
Incorrect. Alarm detected.
Contacting security.

11:00.445 --> 11:04.432
Kinda figured you'd turn up here, hotshot.
Just your style.

11:04.552 --> 11:07.744
You borrow the ship. Rush into danger.
Catch the killer.

11:07.864 --> 11:10.152
Save the day.
Big hero.

11:10.475 --> 11:13.634
You forgot get the girl.
There's probably a girl somewhere in this.

11:13.902 --> 11:15.481
Don't try to stop me, big guy.

11:15.601 --> 11:18.182
Who's trying to stop you?
I'm coming with you!

11:18.701 --> 11:19.839
Forget anything?

11:21.517 --> 11:23.427
Okay, you can tag along.

11:24.053 --> 11:26.803
I've been saving your butt
ever since boot camp...

11:26.923 --> 11:28.652
No reason to stop now.

11:29.803 --> 11:30.478
Wow.

11:31.828 --> 11:33.421
Look at that...

11:34.115 --> 11:37.023
This thing's engine's gigant power battery.

11:38.517 --> 11:39.268
Wow.

11:39.816 --> 11:41.816
- She's beutiful.
- She?

11:42.193 --> 11:44.683
She. A ship is always she.

11:45.442 --> 11:47.117
Wonder how you fly this baby...

11:47.379 --> 11:49.760
Please define term: Beutiful.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.144
That must be the AI nav-computer.

11:52.801 --> 11:54.208
Hello... Aya.

11:54.328 --> 11:56.621
We're your new best friends:
Hal and Kilowog.

11:56.741 --> 11:58.295
We want to learn how to fly you.

11:58.557 --> 12:02.515
AI does not spell Aya, it spells Ayee.

12:02.813 --> 12:05.969
But Aya is a pretty name.
A pretty name for a pretty girl.

12:06.231 --> 12:07.858
Don't you ever stop?

12:08.244 --> 12:10.807
New designation accepted. Aya.

12:11.069 --> 12:14.078
- Aya, would you like to play a game?
- What game?

12:14.198 --> 12:16.285
This game is called Joyride.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.056
How does one play Joyride?

12:19.732 --> 12:23.111
I disagree.
The Corps must be told everything we know.

12:23.373 --> 12:24.779
We know nothing for certain.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.364
All we have is a theory.

12:27.482 --> 12:28.208
Look!

12:34.031 --> 12:35.508
Somebody's coming.

12:38.388 --> 12:39.920
Initiate ultra-warp, now!

12:40.040 --> 12:43.340
Ultra-warp protocol requires
at least 43 minutes to calculate.

12:43.602 --> 12:47.389
Aya, listen to me. Kilowog and I are
Green Lanterns. We help people.

12:47.509 --> 12:51.041
Right now there's some other Green
Lanterns in trouble at the coordinates I gave you.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.411
It is unsafe to bypass protocols.

12:53.531 --> 12:56.561
Green Lanterns risk their lives
to save the lives of others.

12:56.846 --> 12:58.134
Aya, please.

13:19.595 --> 13:20.236
Hm.

13:27.562 --> 13:31.847
Warning! Bypassing protocols has resulted in
unstable ultra-warp field.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.707
Disintegration imminent.

13:39.812 --> 13:43.312
Hull integrity at seven point seven five percent.

13:43.578 --> 13:45.847
Aya, can you convert to manual controls?

13:45.967 --> 13:49.155
Affirmative. However manual control a vehicle
while in ultra-warp...

13:49.417 --> 13:50.197
Do it!

13:55.397 --> 13:56.661
How is this better?!

13:56.925 --> 13:58.150
If I can slow us down...

13:58.270 --> 14:02.526
...I might be able to punch through the
ultra-warp conduit without breaking her apart.

14:20.243 --> 14:20.919
Wow.

14:21.814 --> 14:23.381
Frontier space.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.364
I wonder what the odds are
for me making my dinner with Carol...

14:31.626 --> 14:34.667
A billion lightyears from home,
and that's what you're thinkin'?

14:34.963 --> 14:39.005
- You must've really lost it for this girl.
- Uh, no!

14:39.125 --> 14:42.733
Attention! I am picking up telemetry
from a nearby Power Ring.

14:43.744 --> 14:48.713
It's a GL! And Hal, whoever he is, he's alive.

14:48.977 --> 14:52.314
But not for long. He is in a fire fight.
And losing.

14:52.952 --> 14:54.187
Buckle up, people.

14:54.733 --> 14:56.990
This is now officially a rescue mission.

15:11.708 --> 15:12.575
Not bad.

15:12.855 --> 15:16.868
In fact I'll graciously allow you to
make up for your earlier squeamishness.

15:17.130 --> 15:19.601
You can strike the final blow Razer.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.421
Unless of course you are too weak!

15:55.862 --> 15:56.824
Weaklings!

15:57.086 --> 16:00.805
Your feeble constructs are crushed beneath
the Red Lanterns might!

16:03.728 --> 16:06.543
Red Lantern? What is a Red Lantern?!

16:06.663 --> 16:08.823
These guys I'm guessing.
Let's move!

16:31.412 --> 16:33.646
Easy, we're the cavalry here to rescue you.

16:38.085 --> 16:40.702
I'm running low.
You have enough juice to fly him back?

16:41.506 --> 16:45.672
A big shot GL from Oa, huh?
Maybe I ought to be saving you.

16:46.177 --> 16:49.152
I'll draw their fire while you get the
comedian back to the interceptor.

16:49.272 --> 16:53.445
Yeah, I had a feelin' that was comin'.
What do you want written on your tombstone?

16:53.971 --> 16:57.309
"Spent the rest of his long life
making sure his ring was charged."

17:41.324 --> 17:45.388
Sorry I can't stay and chat.
But I've got some Lantern killers to finish of.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.077
Thank you.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.116
Just enough for one last trick.

19:09.244 --> 19:12.149
In brightest day and blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight...

19:12.269 --> 19:15.805
...let those who worship evil's might,
beware my power, Green Lantern's Light!

19:41.722 --> 19:43.021
Easy, hotshot.

19:43.265 --> 19:47.036
Think you're pretty clever charging you ring
off the engine like that huh?

19:47.317 --> 19:49.651
I say you're luck not to blow your arm off.

19:50.645 --> 19:52.135
It feels like I did.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.486
- What about the other?
- Don't worry about hard case over there...

19:55.606 --> 19:58.977
He's gonna be a little sore...
for the rest of his life.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.020
Where are our friends, Ball and Chain?

20:01.140 --> 20:03.836
Your firework display sent them on a little trip.

20:04.159 --> 20:07.012
But I got a bad feeling we'll be
seeing them again soon.

20:07.426 --> 20:09.522
But in the meantime, who knows...

20:09.642 --> 20:12.936
Maybe we'll be back in time for
your date with Carol after all.

20:13.672 --> 20:17.124
Dinner will have to wait.
We're here now, we fight them.

20:17.705 --> 20:18.915
We stop them.

20:19.297 --> 20:22.431
What ever it takes.
How ever long it takes.

20:23.679 --> 20:24.877
We stop them.

20:32.349 --> 20:36.884
Hal Jordan of Earth,
soon to be former Green Lantern of sector 2814.

20:37.114 --> 20:39.458
You are now charged with treason, grand thef-

20:39.578 --> 20:42.671
Let's postpone my lynching until
I tell you a couple of things.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.487
What have you found, Hal Jordan?

20:45.102 --> 20:46.786
You see these handsome devils?

20:46.906 --> 20:51.102
They're the Lantern killers you said didn't exist.
Call themselves Red Lanterns.

20:51.222 --> 20:52.161
Ring any bells?

20:52.423 --> 20:54.775
Red Lanterns, are you sure?

20:54.895 --> 20:58.526
He has concocted this ruse to save himself
from a deserved punishment.

20:58.781 --> 21:02.959
Respectfully, sir. I got an aching jaw
that says they ain't no ruse.

21:03.246 --> 21:05.716
Their Power Rings fire
some sort of red energy tha-

21:05.978 --> 21:08.380
They have rings?! Powered by what?

21:08.723 --> 21:11.602
Best guess... A huge desire to
mash us all into pulp.

21:13.029 --> 21:16.366
Kilowog of Bolovax Vik.
What is your recommendation?

21:16.739 --> 21:21.441
I say we high tail it back to Oa, cram the
interceptor with as many GLs as she'll hold...

21:21.561 --> 21:24.986
...ultra-warp back and kick their red butts
until they're black and blue!

21:25.248 --> 21:29.072
Despite the colorful terminology,
a logical course of action.

21:30.336 --> 21:33.369
Sensors have picked up an unmanned
probe sweeping the area.

21:33.631 --> 21:36.789
Markings match the insignia of the
recently encountered hostiles.

21:37.051 --> 21:40.782
Right. Red Lanterns.
Aya, plot intercept course. It's go time.

21:41.007 --> 21:43.694
Hal Jordan of Earth,
do not terminate this communication..!

21:44.057 --> 21:46.236
Sorry, gotta take this, don't be a stranger.

21:51.692 --> 21:54.724
This threat may turn out to be nothing
more than a few extremists.

21:54.986 --> 21:56.622
If the truth does come out...

21:56.742 --> 22:00.062
...many will wonder why it isn't recorded
in the book of Oa.

22:00.419 --> 22:05.113
Because Sayd, the history is written,
or unwritten, by the victors.

22:09.026 --> 22:11.064
Forget about snaring it, just blast it!

22:15.434 --> 22:17.523
Warning! Shield degrading.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.091
Hal, break off!
Stick to the plan.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.302
We go for reinforcements, then come back!

22:31.564 --> 22:34.013
We can't let this thing give away our position!

22:34.275 --> 22:36.189
What position?!
We're going home!

22:36.309 --> 22:40.307
The Red Lanterns cought you with your pants
down back on that rock and you want payback!

22:44.112 --> 22:47.860
Direct hit to port ampoules.
Shield's degrading to critical.

22:48.122 --> 22:50.143
Please do not let that happen again.

22:50.791 --> 22:53.061
Get ready to fire when I clear that rock.

23:07.101 --> 23:08.172
Peekaboo.

23:13.396 --> 23:14.224
Happy?

23:15.608 --> 23:16.764
That felt good!

23:17.234 --> 23:21.820
A probe tlike that means the Red Lanterns are
more than two killers with rings and a symbol.

23:22.164 --> 23:23.437
They're organized.

23:23.699 --> 23:26.329
Yeah...
Looks like we can't hog all the fun.

23:26.449 --> 23:28.747
Let's hit HQ and load up
the boys like we planned.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.288
Aya, take us home.

23:30.623 --> 23:31.946
Arching ultra-warp drives.

23:32.282 --> 23:35.958
Ready in three... two... one...
Impel.

23:47.229 --> 23:48.630
Are we there yet?

23:49.492 --> 23:50.894
Aya, what happened?

23:51.582 --> 23:54.652
Overload due to hairline crack
in the ultra-warp coil.

23:54.772 --> 23:57.702
Most likely caused by last
missile hit by enemy probe.

23:58.619 --> 24:02.135
For the record, she said most likely...
Not totally likely.

24:02.255 --> 24:05.358
- What does that mean?
- It means we're gonna be a little late to Oa.

24:05.478 --> 24:09.444
That's okay, I like to make an entrance.
Aya, please estimate time for repairs.

24:09.745 --> 24:10.687
Calculating.

24:10.807 --> 24:14.393
- Ultra-warp ready in nine point two...
- Nine minutes, no problem!

24:14.629 --> 24:16.948
Nine point two one months.

24:18.476 --> 24:19.470
Okay...

24:19.878 --> 24:23.164
Can we form a construct and replace
the defective part for the ride home?

24:23.426 --> 24:27.418
The construct would have to be an exact
copy of the ultra-warp coil mechanism.

24:27.680 --> 24:32.418
And it's 56 moving parts to within
a 0.8162 microns tolerance.

24:33.668 --> 24:35.259
Can either of you do that?

24:36.438 --> 24:39.187
- I make hammers.
- Look, maybe it's for the best...

24:39.307 --> 24:41.732
The Guardians won't deal
with the problem like we will.

24:41.852 --> 24:43.846
We'll make those Red Lanterns pay.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.341
Is he all right?

24:48.461 --> 24:50.519
Just... a little light headed...

24:50.639 --> 24:52.302
He's taken a beating.

24:52.422 --> 24:56.947
He needs a real doctor, he's not making
nine hours, never mind nine months!

24:57.285 --> 25:00.034
I was kinda looking forward to seeing Oa.

25:01.881 --> 25:06.008
Aya, scan for the nearest inhabited world.
Preferably one with a hospital.

25:06.128 --> 25:07.483
Don't bother...

25:07.603 --> 25:09.603
I know my own sector anywhere.

25:10.087 --> 25:12.113
We're not far from my home colony.

25:12.516 --> 25:15.925
Sounds like a good place to lay low
for a while and get you fixed up.

25:39.794 --> 25:44.575
You had three Green Lanterns
in your grasp, and let them escape?!

25:45.085 --> 25:48.988
Perhaps you're not wholly committed
to our righteous crusade.

25:49.108 --> 25:55.381
I live to serve the mighty Atrocitus,
your will is the core of my very being.

25:55.643 --> 25:58.323
What good is that to me Zilius Zox...

25:58.443 --> 26:03.055
... if you're not competent to kill
a mere three Green Lanterns?

26:03.405 --> 26:08.727
It was this child's fault! He's been
promoted too quickly, and on false grounds!

26:09.245 --> 26:13.207
He pitied them!
The destroyers of our system!

26:13.327 --> 26:15.568
What do you have to say for yourself Razer?

26:15.900 --> 26:20.728
Zox lies. But these Lanterns were
different from those we eliminated before.

26:21.009 --> 26:22.992
Tougher... Better trained...

26:23.633 --> 26:25.493
How could they know already?

26:26.236 --> 26:28.784
- Who my lord?
- The Guardians of Oa!

26:28.904 --> 26:34.170
If they've sent reinforcements then
your failure may jeopardize my plans!

26:34.471 --> 26:36.595
No! They must be destroyed!

26:36.715 --> 26:40.366
They must die for Shard,
all for you and Shard, master!

26:40.486 --> 26:44.421
That's right Zilius.
Shard is sacred ground.

26:44.541 --> 26:50.910
A piece of the remains of our world which the
Guardians attempted to erase from the universe.

26:52.431 --> 26:55.335
They did not succeed then, and will not today!

26:57.413 --> 26:58.235
Look.

27:00.801 --> 27:04.941
It seems one of my hunter killer drones
found the Green Lantens.

27:08.832 --> 27:12.961
Your "hunter killer drone" isn't
much on the killer part, is it?

27:13.081 --> 27:15.012
The done's attack was a feint.

27:15.132 --> 27:19.275
It's actual goal was to plant a tracker
which will lead us to them.

27:20.069 --> 27:24.489
And then we'll draw out these
Guardian lapdogs and destroy them.

27:24.948 --> 27:27.024
Wherever they may hide.

27:35.049 --> 27:36.425
Don't be such a baby.

27:36.545 --> 27:38.567
Very handy to have a doctor for a wife.

27:39.098 --> 27:42.156
Medicine is something I picked up
because of my husband's second job.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.798
She's actually the colony's head geologist.

27:44.918 --> 27:46.702
I was an engineer, that was how we met.

27:46.822 --> 27:50.718
Beata's the genius who dreamed up
using the volcanoes lava as thermal power.

27:51.091 --> 27:53.571
So was that your secret identity, engineer?

27:53.927 --> 27:55.125
Secret what?

27:56.668 --> 28:00.183
That's Hal's hang-up,
that thing on his face, it's a mask.

28:00.303 --> 28:04.799
He wears it in case some earthling sneaks
unto the interceptor, while in space mind you...

28:04.919 --> 28:10.053
... and goes: Aha! The Green Lantern on my
planet is Hal Jordan! I'm telling everyone!

28:13.986 --> 28:18.916
Haha... Talk to me when your planets invents
paparazzi and the 24-hour news cycle.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.267
Daddy!

28:20.788 --> 28:23.681
Wait... Who is this giant?1

28:24.089 --> 28:25.987
What have you done with my daughter Amala?

28:27.006 --> 28:28.280
I am Amala!

28:29.213 --> 28:32.637
Now, now... Time for hugs later.
Let daddy rest.

28:32.757 --> 28:33.742
Bye daddy!

28:41.271 --> 28:44.967
This is some place...
Kinda reminds me of where I grew up...

28:45.421 --> 28:46.465
Bolovax Vik.

28:47.166 --> 28:50.465
I'm sorry.
Even here we heard about it's destruction.

28:53.404 --> 28:55.930
Your planet was destroyed?
I-I never knew...

28:56.469 --> 28:59.638
Just concentrate on gettin' us out of
this mess you made hotshot.

28:59.758 --> 29:00.566
Attention!

29:00.828 --> 29:03.235
I have found a tracking device
on the interceptor's hull...

29:03.497 --> 29:05.501
... and require assistance removing it.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.211
Do you think they..?

29:14.209 --> 29:14.942
Yeah.

29:15.062 --> 29:16.667
Pretty sure they do.

29:36.642 --> 29:41.062
This colony know enjoys the protection
of the Red Lantern Corps.

29:41.410 --> 29:44.318
You have been liberated from
the tyranny of the Guardians.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.987
But their Green Lantern lackeys are here...

29:47.301 --> 29:51.690
You have one solar hour to
bring these war criminals to us...

29:52.004 --> 29:54.850
... or your planet will be vaporized.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.671
Those murdering red-...

30:04.791 --> 30:06.548
We have to turn ourselves over to them.

30:06.810 --> 30:07.779
Shyir, no!

30:07.899 --> 30:10.905
- We don't have a choice!
- These guys are murderers.

30:11.025 --> 30:13.305
They're gonna blow up this rock
no matter what you do!

30:13.567 --> 30:14.958
We do have a choice.

30:15.078 --> 30:18.811
We can fight them. And keep fighting,
until we can't fight anymore.

30:19.431 --> 30:22.743
That thing is a fortress.
A frontal attack would be suicide.

30:22.863 --> 30:26.718
Hey, if you've got another way, I'm all ears,
but we've got to take that thing out!

30:26.838 --> 30:29.131
The Earth-Man is right, we must go!

30:36.810 --> 30:37.880
Shyir, wait!

30:40.010 --> 30:41.408
I have another way!

30:47.712 --> 30:50.759
Time's up!
Shall I initiate the countdown to detonation?

30:51.068 --> 30:53.438
No. Razer will do it.

30:55.265 --> 30:59.852
Atrocitus, our cause is right and just...
But, to kill innocents...

31:00.217 --> 31:04.179
As I told you master, he's weak!
Weak...

31:04.299 --> 31:08.485
The Guardians and their lapdogs
destroyed my homeworld.

31:08.821 --> 31:11.980
And Zilius's. And countless others.

31:12.334 --> 31:17.494
By making an example of these disloyal few,
we save millions later

31:17.756 --> 31:22.351
Show weakness now and
you doom our people forever.

31:22.845 --> 31:26.292
I am not weak.
I am not a coward.

31:27.371 --> 31:30.507
For the greater good.
And vengence!

31:31.006 --> 31:33.343
Countdown sequence initiated.

31:33.605 --> 31:37.097
You have five minutes to get to
minimum safe orbital distance.

31:39.674 --> 31:40.757
Knock, knock!

31:41.822 --> 31:43.075
Anybody home?!

31:44.018 --> 31:45.127
Zox, come!

31:48.566 --> 31:51.076
Razer, stay and guard the device.

31:51.196 --> 31:53.395
If attacked, do your duty.

32:01.810 --> 32:04.541
Soon your ring will be
all that's left of you Lantern!

32:06.305 --> 32:08.147
Settle down, demented beach ball.

32:18.378 --> 32:23.524
I am Atrocitus.
Lord and master of the Red Lantern Corps.

32:23.644 --> 32:27.981
I am the one who will destroy
the Guardians and all they stand for.

32:28.243 --> 32:32.487
I am wrath!
I am hate!

32:32.972 --> 32:35.364
I am righteous vengeance!

32:42.793 --> 32:45.958
According to Beata's map,
we're right under it.

32:46.284 --> 32:49.294
Boy, I hope she is right about this.
I'm bakin' here!

32:49.556 --> 32:50.960
She's always right.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.432
This way!

33:01.483 --> 33:04.846
That must be the controlpanel.
You think you can disarm it Rev?

33:05.823 --> 33:07.483
I'll need a few minute-...

33:21.783 --> 33:23.299
Die, die, die!

33:41.149 --> 33:42.303
Hurry up, Rev!

33:45.475 --> 33:46.876
This guy's not playing around!

33:47.197 --> 33:49.684
Keep him back,
for just a couple of minutes.

33:50.147 --> 33:51.481
This is your fault!

33:51.746 --> 33:55.402
You Green Lanterns might enjoy destroying worlds.
But I do not!

33:59.253 --> 34:01.610
I case you haven't been
keeping up on current events...

34:01.730 --> 34:04.369
... you guys put this thing here,
and pressed the button!

34:04.672 --> 34:06.538
You wanna help!? Stop fighting us!

34:06.800 --> 34:10.570
I won't listen to your lies.
I'll destroy you both!

34:13.159 --> 34:16.485
And what, you gonna mass murder
them by blowing up the planet!?

34:17.530 --> 34:21.379
You know what you're fighting againts, kid.
But what are you fighting for?!

34:35.110 --> 34:36.109
Dumb kid...

34:36.402 --> 34:38.612
Where are Shyir?
Lets have some good news!

34:38.887 --> 34:41.562
Detonation in thirty seconds.

34:52.362 --> 34:54.248
This is disappointing.

34:54.706 --> 34:59.394
If you're the best the Guardians have,
my victory is assured!

35:06.555 --> 35:09.267
Master, the bomb is active.
We need to move away.

35:20.123 --> 35:20.976
Three...

35:21.269 --> 35:21.989
Two...

35:22.314 --> 35:23.015
One.

35:25.105 --> 35:27.016
Detonate. Detonate.

35:28.583 --> 35:29.665
Time to go.

35:29.785 --> 35:33.674
I can keep the laser from igniting
the plutonium, for a little while anyway.

35:34.554 --> 35:36.605
I know what happened to Bolovax Vik.

35:36.885 --> 35:40.853
If you had a chance to save your world...
What would you do?

35:49.384 --> 35:50.773
It's been an honor.

36:01.112 --> 36:04.424
It's foolish to stay when there's
no hope, Green Lantern.

36:04.933 --> 36:09.137
Yeah... we're dumb that way.
But there always hope.

36:09.815 --> 36:14.404
I know you're not all bad.
Maybe it's time you let others know too.

36:16.864 --> 36:20.966
Best get going, son.
I can handle this last part myself.

36:53.903 --> 36:56.333
It appears you were wrong about Razer.

36:56.595 --> 36:59.252
Never have I been so happy to be wrong.

36:59.546 --> 37:03.232
I'll have the choir scream his
praises at the Rage ceremony.

37:03.352 --> 37:06.560
Now that we've eliminated
the Lanterns from Oa...

37:06.680 --> 37:10.395
Soon this galaxy will be ours for the taking.

37:10.515 --> 37:14.269
And then the Guardians will pay
for what they've done!

37:30.827 --> 37:33.133
Kilowog? Rev?

37:39.175 --> 37:41.112
They aren't here anymore.

37:49.513 --> 37:52.965
Is that the best you can do?!
You think that will stop me?!

38:15.185 --> 38:18.081
You won't will unless you can
do what is necessary.

38:18.343 --> 38:20.471
Can you do it?
Can you?!

38:25.609 --> 38:26.715
Finish it.

38:33.239 --> 38:34.908
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

38:37.404 --> 38:39.432
But you're not getting of that easy.

38:39.552 --> 38:42.197
You'll live with the consequences
of what you've done.

38:42.317 --> 38:44.173
No! You must kill me!

38:44.494 --> 38:47.192
I'm the one responsible for all
this death and destruction.

38:47.312 --> 38:48.403
I deserve it!

38:48.700 --> 38:51.323
Which is why you're going
to help make up for it.

38:55.259 --> 38:58.992
Coward... Are you too weak to take your vengance?

39:08.909 --> 39:10.692
Don't... push it...

39:13.992 --> 39:16.604
- You ganna help me with this, hotshot?
- Kilowog!

39:17.027 --> 39:21.038
I got most of the colonists up before
the big bang, but my ring is running low.

39:21.488 --> 39:23.146
I believe I can help.

39:34.660 --> 39:37.374
What's he doing inside that bubble?

39:37.672 --> 39:42.082
Never mind him.
You are a sight for sore eyes. You too, Aya.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.332
- Thank you.
- What about Rev. Did he make it?

39:58.486 --> 40:01.339
I hope everyone knows the sacrifice Shyir made.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.271
They do. The elders are going to
name our new planet after him.

40:10.246 --> 40:13.780
Your daddy was very brave, Amala.
He saved us all.

40:14.723 --> 40:17.424
Is it okay if I still miss him?

40:18.099 --> 40:20.086
Yeah. We all will.

40:25.637 --> 40:28.832
You know, Shyir really did save them all.

40:29.836 --> 40:33.951
He asked me what i'd do if I had
another chance of saving my own planet.

40:35.043 --> 40:38.888
And thats when it hit me, I'd save the people.

40:39.519 --> 40:41.494
At least one of us got it right.

41:01.893 --> 41:05.415
Cooling system now functional.
Continuing repairs.

41:05.998 --> 41:07.751
So, what's next?

41:08.151 --> 41:10.355
Next, we find the Red Lanterns.

41:11.343 --> 41:15.773
Just how are we gonna stop who knows how
many super poweredful Red Lanterns...

41:15.893 --> 41:17.633
... with just the two of us?

41:18.002 --> 41:20.003
That's a really good question, Kilowog.

41:20.333 --> 41:23.670
Here's another one, what should
we do with the one we captured?

41:23.948 --> 41:30.084
