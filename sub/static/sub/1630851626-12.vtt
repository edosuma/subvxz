Previously onB Positive...Meredith.

00:04.178 --> 00:06.006
Oh, my God.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.486
Is everything okay?

00:08.530 --> 00:10.445
Call 911.

00:11.837 --> 00:12.882
How is she?

00:12.925 --> 00:15.145
She's gone.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.152
Sorry you had to
cut your trip short.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.328
Oh, it's okay.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.851
Things weren't going that great.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.636
Oh, why not?

00:27.679 --> 00:29.681
Well, I met a woman.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.162
We got drunk and, uh...

00:32.206 --> 00:33.685
you know.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.645
No, I don't know.

00:36.688 --> 00:39.082
Come on. You know.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.826
I don't know. Tell me.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.524
We had intimate relations.

00:46.568 --> 00:49.440
Which I was led to believe
were mutually satisfying.

00:49.484 --> 00:52.965
However, upon my awakening,
I discovered she had robbed me.

00:53.009 --> 00:55.881
[laughing]

00:55.925 --> 00:58.536
Oh, no.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.365
DREW:
Look at us.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.540
Out on the open road,

01:02.584 --> 01:03.715
seeing the beautiful sights

01:03.759 --> 01:05.456
of this great land of ours.Yeah.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.502
That's a lovely Costco.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.809
You need to take I-90.Uh, no.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.073
Actually, we're gonna
take the I-95 South

01:13.116 --> 01:14.552
to the Florida Keys.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.424
Yeah, I've always wanted
to see Hemingway's house

01:16.467 --> 01:18.208
and eat an authentic Cubano.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.905
BT-dubs,
that's a ham sandwich...

01:19.949 --> 01:22.865
I know what it is....with cheese and pickles.

01:22.908 --> 01:25.737
[chuckles] Then we'll
head up the Gulf Coast,

01:25.781 --> 01:29.045
and make our way west
to the Grand Tetons.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.918
What you're about to see is
the future of Valley Hills.

01:32.962 --> 01:36.226
Isn't this the room where
Knudsen croaked on the crapper?

01:36.270 --> 01:39.708
Yeah, that's why we are
focusing on the future.Wait.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.927
Someone died in that room?NORMA: Oh, please.

01:41.971 --> 01:45.235
Show me a room in this place
where someone hasn't died.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.889
Forget about the dead people.

01:47.498 --> 01:51.285
Well, remember them
in your hearts, always.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.113
Okay, now...
[clears throat]

01:53.156 --> 01:54.114
Bette?

01:54.157 --> 01:55.724
Oh, yeah.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.599
[gasps]

02:01.643 --> 02:04.863
Oh, my God,
this is beautiful.

02:04.907 --> 02:09.041
Anyone would be lucky
to die here.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.870
I can see myself
lying there,

02:11.914 --> 02:15.526
getting CPR as
I go towards the light.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.267
Oh, and look at the view.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.313
I'd love that to be
the last thing I see.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.316
I'd love for you to be
the last thing I see.

02:22.359 --> 02:25.884
That's fine, as long as
you're on the bottom.

02:25.928 --> 02:29.149
Check this out.
Alexa, lights on.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.455
[all exclaiming]

02:31.499 --> 02:34.371
Alexa, party lights on.

02:34.415 --> 02:38.332
Oh, I feel like I'm
back at Studio 54

02:38.375 --> 02:41.161
making out with
Liza Minnelli.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.814
Alexa, normal lights.

02:42.858 --> 02:46.209
And get that image
out of my head.

02:46.253 --> 02:50.996
Alexa, tell the CIA agent
listening

02:51.040 --> 02:53.651
I am a sovereign citizen.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.916
And there's a steam shower
and a heated floor.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.527
[toilet flushes]

03:00.876 --> 03:02.269
Oh, hey.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.314

04:24.089 --> 04:27.397
Which, in French,
means giant boobs. Ha!

04:27.441 --> 04:29.181
Talk about a settler
with mommy issues.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.574
Mm-hmm.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.359
Oh, come on.
After thousands of miles,

04:32.402 --> 04:33.795
we're almost there.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.797
Yay.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.539
Well, I know which one of us
wasn't a cheer captain.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.759
Oh, scenic turnout,
35 miles.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.805
Yay.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.986
You were right, kid.
This is incredible.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.686
Meh.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.214
I heard you showed everyone
the new room.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.433
Yeah, they loved it.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.479
[laughs, snorts]
I bet they did.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.959
Why are you laughing?You'll see.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.439
Gabby, tell me.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.486
If I do that it'll
spoil all the fun.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.619
Gina, got a second?Yeah, sure. What's up?

05:15.663 --> 05:18.274
That new room,
who's gonna get it?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.928
And so it begins.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.365
Well, I was planning on
showing it

05:22.409 --> 05:23.671
to prospective residents.
You know,

05:23.714 --> 05:25.368
sort of like a model home.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.849
Oh, so you're giving it to
a total stranger?

05:27.892 --> 05:30.242
Someone who's not like
a mother to you?

05:30.286 --> 05:32.810
Sure, that's a better way
to go.

05:32.854 --> 05:36.031
Well, Norma, what would
you suggest?

05:36.074 --> 05:39.121
I'm just thinking out loud,
but what if I got it?

05:39.164 --> 05:40.818
Yeah, I guess so.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.560
I don't see any problem
with that.
Really?

05:43.604 --> 05:45.562
No problems?

05:45.606 --> 05:46.824
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.696
I'm actually done for the day.

05:48.739 --> 05:51.829
I'm just sticking around
to watch the show.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.006
[knock on door]

05:55.050 --> 05:56.094
You busy?

05:56.138 --> 05:57.966
No. What's up?

05:58.009 --> 05:59.446
Bette needs the key card
for the new room

05:59.489 --> 06:00.838
so she can move in.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.406
The heated floor will be perfect
for my hot yoga.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.408
You should try that
with me, Althea.

06:05.452 --> 06:09.107
Honey, what about me says yoga?

06:09.934 --> 06:14.678
I am so sorry, but I already
promised that room to Norma.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.289
But I'm at the top
of the list.What list?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.857
There's a waiting list for
people who want to move rooms.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.685
Nobody told me there's
a waiting list.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.861
There's a waiting list.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.560
Hello.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.653
Hey, what you up to?

06:32.696 --> 06:34.481
I'm looking at doormats
for my new room.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.743
I like this one.
It says:

06:35.786 --> 06:38.398
"Could this visit be a text?"
[laughs]

06:38.441 --> 06:42.271
[laughs]
Yeah, about that.

06:42.314 --> 06:45.709
Um, turns out there is
a waiting list

06:45.753 --> 06:47.581
for people who want to
change rooms.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.322
So it's supposed to
go to Bette.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.194
I see.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.066
And is Bette who you go to

06:55.110 --> 06:57.329
when you have
a personal problem?

06:57.373 --> 07:00.942
Well, no.No.

07:00.985 --> 07:04.075
You don't. You go
to me, don't you?

07:04.119 --> 07:05.860
Yeah. I do.Yeah.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.123
I guess that doesn't matter

07:08.166 --> 07:11.561
because of some list.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.738
Okay, I-I will try
to figure this out.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.045
Just remember,
whatever you decide,

07:17.088 --> 07:18.786
I want you to know
I love you

07:18.829 --> 07:21.789
as if you were
my own daughter.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.356
Aww...

07:24.400 --> 07:26.750
Get it now?

07:32.930 --> 07:35.585
It's like the ice planet Hoth
out there.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.676
You know, Star Wars.Hmm.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.286
You made me watch
those stupid movies.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.637
I'd like some credit
for using the terms, okay?

07:43.680 --> 07:46.509
Sorry, I'm just a little bit
in my head.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.643
Like Luke before he goes to
Dagobah to train with Yoda.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.209
All right, maybe we should
pull over

07:51.253 --> 07:52.646
and put chains on the tires.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.952
I didn't buy chains.Why didn't you buy chains?

07:54.996 --> 07:56.650
Well, the box was very heavy.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.390
Plus, the guy said these were
all-weather tires,

07:58.434 --> 08:00.784
and this is weather.All right.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.004
Maybe we should find someplace
to wait this out.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.309
We'll be fine.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.574
If I start praying,
will it make you nervous?

08:07.617 --> 08:08.662
Funny.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.490
[tires screech]Whoa.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.143
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.928
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

08:13.971 --> 08:16.234
[knock on door]Yeah?

08:17.018 --> 08:20.630
Hey, there's my MeToo hottie.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.677
I don't think you're
using that term right,

08:23.720 --> 08:26.593
but come on in, sit down.

08:26.636 --> 08:27.855
Thanks.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.423
I wanted to talk to you about
getting that new room.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.513
Oh! Did Gabby send you?

08:33.556 --> 08:34.949
What? No.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.212
I've just been here longer
than anybody else.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.474
Well, are you on the list?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.649
I didn't know about the list.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.999
Well, there is a list.Okay.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.480
I get it.
Well, do what you can.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.831
I just like the way that toilet
lights up in the dark.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.400
Comes in handy when you gotta
whiz 14 times a night.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.010
TMI.

08:53.054 --> 08:56.187
No, I talked to a urologist.
It's my prostate.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.363
Size of a grapefruit.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.104
[phone ringing]

09:00.148 --> 09:02.977
Not now, Gabby!

09:09.723 --> 09:12.464
I love this quiet time.

09:12.508 --> 09:16.251
Just the two of us sitting
and reading together.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.601
Yeah, it's nice.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.040
Could I ask you a favor?Of course.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.694
Could you talk to Gina
and tell her that

09:24.738 --> 09:26.174
I should get the new room?

09:26.217 --> 09:29.394
Oh, wow, I literally
just told her that I wanted it.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.831
You? Why would you want it?

09:30.874 --> 09:32.789
What, I can't have nice things?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.574
Well, judging from
your outfit, no.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.707
Anyhow, I'm at the top
of the list.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.622
Well, I have seniority.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.018
But I'm your girlfriend.

09:44.061 --> 09:44.888
You are?

09:44.932 --> 09:45.933
Well, we hung out together

09:45.976 --> 09:47.412
every night this week,

09:47.456 --> 09:48.979
we held hands at movie night.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.286
That means something.

09:51.329 --> 09:54.811
Wow, I got a girlfriend.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.118
And you want this to
continue, right?

09:57.161 --> 09:58.946
Uh, yeah.

09:58.989 --> 10:02.993
Then you'll talk to Gina
about me getting that room.

10:03.037 --> 10:06.910
So you get what you want,

10:06.954 --> 10:10.784
and I don't get
what I want...

10:10.827 --> 10:12.960
Yeah, I got a girlfriend.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.703
[wind whooshing]

10:19.357 --> 10:21.621
It's a mess out there.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.407
So, do you want to play
rock, paper, scissors

10:25.450 --> 10:28.671
to see who eats who?Mm.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.064
What's with you, kid?

10:30.107 --> 10:33.154
I'm sorry, I'm just
a bit tired.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.418
Well, you know me.
I don't mind the quiet.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.988
I feel so lost.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.773
So we're not doing
the quiet thing.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.819
Well, I thought seeing
the Grand Tetons

10:45.862 --> 10:47.124
would be transformational,

10:47.168 --> 10:50.388
but it turns out
they're just mountains.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.781
Are you kidding?
You just saw

10:51.825 --> 10:54.131
one of America's wonders;
it was gorgeous.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.393
I guess.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.613
Well, that's what
you set out to do.Yeah.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.660
And I have done it,
and it was a huge letdown.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.794
Damn it, it's
freezing in here.Yeah.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.101
Oh, great,
it's blowing cold air.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.233
Oh...

11:09.277 --> 11:10.844
We don't have
hot water, either.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.976
Great, we must be out
of propane.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.066
Well, we can run the engine
and pull the heat off there.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.547
We don't have enough gas
to last all night.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.983
[sighs]

11:20.027 --> 11:21.550
We're in a blizzard
in the middle of nowhere.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.160
This is how I die.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.510
A grizzly is gonna eat
Gina's kidney.Relax, relax.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.338
It's not even grizz season.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.992
My dad was right.
I never should have

11:29.036 --> 11:31.081
quit Boy Scouts for gymnastics.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.694
Okay, the way I see it,
we have two options.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.260
We either freeze to death,

11:36.304 --> 11:39.437
or we climb into a sleeping bag
and cuddle for warmth.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.789
Looks like we're gonna die.

11:48.882 --> 11:52.015
So, Jerry, you ever think
about dating again,

11:52.059 --> 11:53.234
getting back on the horse?

11:53.277 --> 11:55.236
Sure, I'd love to
meet somebody.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.934
What would you say if I had
the perfect gal for you?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.849
I'd say great, set it up.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.678
I will. I just need
a little favor...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.201
Done!

12:06.508 --> 12:07.683
Come with me.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.904
Hold on,
I unbuttoned my pants.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.950
Spencer has something
to tell you.Oh.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.647
Uh, okay.Yeah.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.172
As a former police officer,

12:18.215 --> 12:20.217
I know the importance of rules.

12:20.261 --> 12:23.046
And therefore we should
respect the list

12:23.090 --> 12:25.135
and give the new room
to Bette.

12:25.179 --> 12:29.792
Otherwise we're no better
than North Korea, or California.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.187
Well, I guess the list
is hard to argue with.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.232
All the greats were
guided by lists.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.320
Santa.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.408
Schindler.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.802
Craig.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.109
I trust you'll do
the right thing.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.852
FYI, I still want the room
for myself.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.201
But you just said...

12:47.244 --> 12:50.291
I know what I said.
Work with me.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.381
Sorry to bother you, but

12:53.424 --> 12:55.209
have you made a decision
about the room yet?

12:55.252 --> 12:56.950
Oh, for God sakes,
not you, too!

12:56.993 --> 12:58.690
Oh, no, not for me,
for Norma.

12:58.734 --> 12:59.996
She sent you?

13:00.040 --> 13:03.086
Excuse me, just getting
a cup of joe.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.791
[knocking on door]

13:11.834 --> 13:14.315
Hello? Anybody?

13:14.358 --> 13:17.013
No one's here.
We have to break in.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.450
What? No. I've never
broken the law in my life.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.583
You've never frozen
to death before either.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.978
Now, which new fun thing
would you like to try tonight?

13:25.021 --> 13:28.372
Okay, but we leave it cleaner
than we found it.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.509
You're doing a bad thing,
but you're not a bad person.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.121
[pained groan]

13:38.165 --> 13:40.210
Look at this.
The key was under the mat.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.343
Great.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.264
Oh, no. Power's out.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.963
Oh, hello, deer.
[laughs]

13:54.007 --> 13:55.530
All right, you try
to start a fire,

13:55.573 --> 13:59.186
I'll see if the stove
is working.Surely.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.057
[Cockney accent]: Ooh, blimey!
This chimney's covered

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
in more soot than
a Liverpool pigeon.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.147
[Drew chuckles]

14:04.191 --> 14:06.410
That's my chimney sweep
character.

14:06.454 --> 14:07.368
Stove's not working,

14:07.411 --> 14:10.762
but I found us some provisions.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.807
Oh, hot cocoa?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.243
Whiskey.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.028
Aww.

14:16.116 --> 14:19.597
Attention! Hello, everybody.

14:19.641 --> 14:23.514
I have made a decision
about the new room.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.690
Sorry, loser.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.170
I put your names
in this hat,

14:27.214 --> 14:29.694
and whoever is picked
gets the room.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.480
You've rigged it so
you can pick your favorite.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.656
Damn right she has.
When do I move in?

14:34.699 --> 14:38.051
Bert is gonna do it,
and he can't cheat,

14:38.094 --> 14:40.705
because he doesn't know
any of your names.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.794
That's not true.NORMA: Really?

14:42.838 --> 14:43.795
What's my name?

14:43.839 --> 14:46.320
You're dressing on the side.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.409
Just pick a name.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.193
There's no mousetrap
in there, right?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.892
I'm not falling for that again.NORMA: Screw the hat.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.545
I should get the room.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.982
I just had major surgery.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.244
We've all had major surgery.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.290
Vaginal rejuvenation
doesn't count.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.076
The democratic thing
would be to vote.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.468
I agree.Me, too.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.730
That's not what
we're gonna do.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.602
I vote for myself.What?!

15:07.645 --> 15:08.690
Give the room to Norma.

15:08.733 --> 15:09.909
I haven't touched a woman

15:09.952 --> 15:12.041
in over four years.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.000
I've been here
the longest.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.610
We all want it.I'm next on the list.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.439
Over my dead body.I can wait a week.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.789
I'm so lonely.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.139
Shut up! Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up!

15:23.183 --> 15:26.534
You're all acting like
spoiled brats, so,

15:26.577 --> 15:28.971
so no one gets the room!

15:29.754 --> 15:30.886
GABBY: Gina.What?!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.019
Have a great night.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.069
Mmm.

15:40.113 --> 15:43.072
This is some decent hooch.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.380
I prefer a hard seltzer,
but yes.

15:46.423 --> 15:50.297
Listen, thanks for letting me
hijack your trip.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.256
Are you kidding me?
It was my pleasure.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.042
Thanks to you I now know that
premium gasoline is

15:56.085 --> 15:57.608
nothing but a scam.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.742
Thanks to you I found out that
Sudafed is effective,

16:00.785 --> 16:03.745
but Zyrtec lasts longer.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.269
Oh, well, on the way home
I will give you the scoop

16:06.313 --> 16:08.141
on Prilosec versus Pepcid AC.

16:08.184 --> 16:11.448
You, sir, will be blown away.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.060
Seriously,
if it wasn't for you,

16:14.103 --> 16:17.063
I'd be sitting at home
thinking about Meredith.

16:17.106 --> 16:20.718
Oh, well, I'm happy
I could be there for you.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.546
Tell me,

16:22.590 --> 16:26.855
what was going on with you
back there at the Tetons, hmm?

16:26.898 --> 16:28.683
Oh, it was nothing.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.772
Let's just drink.Eh. Aw,
come on. I...

16:30.815 --> 16:32.121
I actually want to talk.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.994
You should take advantage
of that. Come on.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.518
I guess this trip

16:37.561 --> 16:40.738
hasn't changed me
the way I hoped it would.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.958
It absolutely has changed you.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.873
No, it hasn't.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.179
Come on. Really?

16:46.222 --> 16:48.050
In the last month,

16:48.094 --> 16:49.312
you sold your house

16:49.356 --> 16:50.835
to buy a camper van

16:50.879 --> 16:52.141
and travel the country.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.839
You learned how to--
how to fix an engine.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.189
You drove through a blizzard

16:56.232 --> 16:57.494
and broke into a cabin.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.323
[chuckling]
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

17:00.367 --> 17:02.151
And what happened to you
the-the first night on the road?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.674
I met a woman and got robbed.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.546
Of your virginity.[chuckles]

17:05.589 --> 17:07.504
No, I believe
that was to your mama.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.505
[laughs]Ooh.

17:08.549 --> 17:09.593
[chuckling]

17:09.637 --> 17:11.856
Sorry. Schoolyard reflex.
[chuckles]

17:11.900 --> 17:14.250
Kid, I bet you've done
more living in the last month

17:14.294 --> 17:16.339
than you have
in the last ten years.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.776
Well, maybe you're right.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.082
Maybe I have changed.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.518
And you're just getting started.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.085
Do you realize
how many people

17:23.129 --> 17:24.782
would kill
to trade places with you?

17:24.826 --> 17:27.655
50 years old, with
your whole life ahead of you.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.048
I'm 35.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.397
Really?

17:31.615 --> 17:33.748
Sheesh.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.534
Sign here.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.188
And here.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.799
Initial here.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.672
Uh, sign.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.674
Sign.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.284
That one, too.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.069
Uh, and initial.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.549
I'm afraid to ask
what I'm signing.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.551
That's what
I'm counting on.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.249
[knocking]

17:56.292 --> 17:58.077
Can we talk?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.340
Oh, God. The room again?

18:00.383 --> 18:02.211
No, I don'twant it.Neither do I.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.386
I'm good where I am.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.866
JERRY:
You were right.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.563
We were being selfish.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.435
We all talked
about it, and...

18:08.478 --> 18:11.177
there's really only one person
who deserves the room

18:11.220 --> 18:12.308
and that's Harry.[sighs]

18:12.352 --> 18:14.615
Ooh. Plot twist.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.704
Why Harry?

18:16.747 --> 18:19.098
We know how hard it
is to lose a spouse.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.403
Yeah, we can't
let him go back

18:20.447 --> 18:22.144
to the room he shared
with Meredith.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.580
Too many memories.GIDEON:
Oh.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.279
Plot twist with
a tear in my eye.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.630
That is...

18:29.673 --> 18:31.240
so...

18:31.284 --> 18:34.025
so nice of you guys.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.418
I feel like a proud mom

18:35.462 --> 18:38.160
with four kids
who are somehow older than me.

18:38.987 --> 18:42.556
And once you renovate Harry's
room, we can consult the list.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.819
Or you give it to
your closest friend.

18:44.862 --> 18:45.994
Or you give it to me.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.518
Ooh. Or Bette.
Just give it to Bette.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.346
I'm so sorry.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.956
I want to have
this conversation,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.481
but, um, I just need
a moment.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.787
[clears throat]

18:56.831 --> 18:58.615
[chuckles softly]

19:02.402 --> 19:04.447
She's not coming
back, is she?

19:04.491 --> 19:05.970
Doesn't look like it.GIDEON:Yeah,

19:06.014 --> 19:07.842
she's getting in her car.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.154
Hey, party peeps.
You miss us?

19:15.197 --> 19:16.981
Oh, my God!Harry![chuckles]

19:17.025 --> 19:18.896
[chattering]Hey!

19:18.940 --> 19:20.768
How you doing?
How are ya?Harry!

19:20.811 --> 19:22.422
I missed you!

19:22.465 --> 19:23.466
Oh, thank you.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.338
[chuckling][laughing]

19:25.381 --> 19:27.166
Oh, did you, uh...

19:27.209 --> 19:30.299
did you meet
any new van chicks?

19:30.343 --> 19:31.822
Funny how that's
your first question.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.868
It's not funny.Oh, it's funny.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.914
Now that you're here, we
have a surprise for you.Oh.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
What is this?

19:48.883 --> 19:50.232
It's your new room.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.712
NORMA:
We knew it would be

19:51.755 --> 19:54.236
too hard for you
to go back to your old room.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.196
We thought you might enjoy
a change of scenery.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.199
Well, I...

20:00.242 --> 20:02.331
I-I don't know what to say.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.681
Try "thank you."

20:04.725 --> 20:06.117
Thank you.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.510
All of you.
This-this...

20:07.554 --> 20:09.730
means a lot to me.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.564
[exhales]

20:21.132 --> 20:23.613
It's too bright.
