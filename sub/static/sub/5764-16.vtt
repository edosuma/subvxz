00:00.407 --> 00:02.133
Previously on Ghost Whisperer

00:02.133 --> 00:03.400
Ghosts don't get hurt.

00:03.433 --> 00:04.934
My mom says they can't feel pain.

00:04.967 --> 00:07.233
She's wrong. We do.

00:07.266 --> 00:09.099
I can still see everything,

00:09.133 --> 00:10.633
All the bad stuff!

00:10.667 --> 00:13.466
The shadows are breaking up!

00:13.500 --> 00:15.767
Whatever they are,
wherever they live,

00:15.800 --> 00:19.266
These shadows are very
interested in ghost children.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.099
The shadows, they
actually want something?

00:21.133 --> 00:22.633
Whatever it is,
they're scary enough

00:22.667 --> 00:25.833
That the book decided to rewrite
itself to erase any mention of them.

00:26.867 --> 00:29.767
Now I'm going to ask you
one last time nicely.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.066
Ned, you're going to
bring me the book now.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.333
If this thing goes off,

00:35.366 --> 00:40.500
I would hate to see it take away
someone who is very precious to you.

00:42.366 --> 00:44.066
It doesn't have to end this way.

00:44.099 --> 00:45.500
Yes, it does.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.000
It's gone, they're gone!

00:47.034 --> 00:49.366
The pages are all gone!

00:49.400 --> 00:51.700
No!

00:55.567 --> 00:57.199
Eli, hurry!

01:03.066 --> 01:04.132
While they're
rebuilding your office,

01:04.166 --> 01:06.533
Everything you need
is right here...

01:06.567 --> 01:10.667
Copier, wireless, phone,
coffee, and best friend.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.667
I have all that stuff at home,

01:12.700 --> 01:14.700
You know, minus the
best friend part.

01:14.733 --> 01:16.366
I know, but you hate
working from home, ok?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.567
And...and no helping any
customers or answering the phone.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.533
I mean it.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.733
Uh, do you want me to unpack these?

01:21.767 --> 01:25.967
No. No! My office is gonna
be back to normal soon. Ok?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.166
Excuse me. All set here.

01:30.199 --> 01:32.934
You know what? It's gonna
be just like old times.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.600
Ok, let me get a copy
of the contract for you.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.900
Y-you can just email it to me.

01:38.934 --> 01:40.199
Here are the keys.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.199
I had the power turned
back on for you.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.667
We haven't set foot in the
place in over 5 years,

01:44.700 --> 01:46.900
So I have no idea what
shape things are in.

01:46.934 --> 01:48.767
Um, would you like to
see the appraisals?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.466
I trust you.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.000
All the antiques
came with the house,

01:52.034 --> 01:53.199
So whatever you think.

01:53.233 --> 01:56.300
You can have it all
cleared out by next week?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.767
Next week? Um...

01:57.800 --> 01:59.400
My husband is already in london,

01:59.433 --> 02:03.233
So the sooner I can sell both our
houses and join him, the better.

02:03.266 --> 02:06.034
Ok. Well, if you need a real
estate agent, I can recommend...

02:06.066 --> 02:07.800
It's all taken care of. Thanks.

02:07.833 --> 02:12.066
Um, we never finished
the restoration.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.366
It turned out to be too big a job.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.800
So be careful.

02:16.833 --> 02:19.066
Thanks for the heads-up.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.266
Catch you later, mom.
See you, Melinda. Mm-hmm.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.967
Nope. Not so fast.
That was Donna peyton.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.034
She's brought an entire house
of antiques on consignment.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.000
You wanna pick up some extra cash?

02:31.034 --> 02:33.099
There's no such
thing as extra cash.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.967
Great. Get started packing,
take some pictures.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.733
Oh, and be careful.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.233
Hello! Anyone there?

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.600 --> 03:05.667
Hello?

03:08.333 --> 03:09.466
Hello?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.466
Ok...

03:28.700 --> 03:31.199
Is somebody there?

03:57.667 --> 03:59.333
I have a friend who can help you.

03:59.366 --> 04:01.767
I'm leaving.

04:21.132 --> 04:23.233
Hello.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.700
Hello?

04:34.700 --> 04:37.233
Hello.

04:57.233 --> 04:58.867
Ok, I get it.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.266
Chains rattling? Seriously?

05:05.300 --> 05:07.300
And then some.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.266
I'm sorry you got hurt.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.366
I'm fine, but there's a really
pissed off ghost in that house.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.867
If you could confirm
that appointment for me,

05:15.900 --> 05:17.833
Wednesday at 2 P.M.
, that'd be great.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.166
Ok. Thanks. Bye.

05:21.466 --> 05:23.099
Oh, my god. What now?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.199
Haunted house.

05:24.233 --> 05:25.600
Nothing's broken.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.600
Delia...

05:32.767 --> 05:35.934
This is all I managed to
grab before the show started.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.333
So there's a lot more?

05:37.366 --> 05:39.099
It's like they just left everything

05:39.133 --> 05:41.867
Exactly where it was and took off.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.034
Or were scared off.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.500
Don't come back,

05:53.533 --> 05:55.633
Or you'll be dead, too.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.767
You said there's a problem?

06:36.801 --> 06:40.066
One of my employees was injured
yesterday in the house.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.100
He's ok, but some strange
things were happening,

06:43.133 --> 06:46.801
And I just wanted to know
why you and your husband

06:46.834 --> 06:48.300
Left so abruptly.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.300
Oh, it was a money pit...

06:50.333 --> 06:52.834
Dry rot, dangerously
outdated electrical.

06:52.867 --> 06:56.966
So it had nothing to do with
the death of your daughter?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.966
How did you know about that?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.933
I do research on all of my clients,

07:03.966 --> 07:06.333
And I found Cassidy's obituary.

07:06.367 --> 07:09.333
She was a beautiful little girl.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.667
Yes, she was,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.801
In so many ways.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.634
She was only 8 when she died.

07:17.667 --> 07:18.901
Louis-barr syndrome.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.600
My husband's a doctor.

07:20.634 --> 07:22.267
He told me about it.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.667
Must have been awful.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.966
We had moved back to Grandview, uh,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.734
So she could get treatment
at Rockland memorial.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.767
We thought this house would be

07:30.801 --> 07:32.333
A new beginning for us.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.767
So you lived here before?

07:33.801 --> 07:36.300
As a child, yeah.
It's such a lovely town.

07:36.333 --> 07:39.000
Then when I saw that
the house was for sale,

07:39.033 --> 07:40.400
It all felt like destiny.

07:40.434 --> 07:41.333
Destiny?

07:41.367 --> 07:42.634
Heh. It's silly, I guess,

07:42.667 --> 07:45.801
But when I was a kid,
I used to walk home from school,

07:45.834 --> 07:48.567
Back when you could do that
without becoming an amber alert.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.400
Anyway, there was this really
sweet old lady who lived there.

07:51.434 --> 07:53.500
She always had children
playing in the yard.

07:53.534 --> 07:55.500
It looked so peaceful,

07:55.534 --> 07:58.333
Almost like a storybook cottage.

07:58.367 --> 08:02.066
Did anything strange happen
when you were living there?

08:04.834 --> 08:07.200
Uh...

08:08.300 --> 08:11.534
Well, sometimes cass
would wake up screaming

08:11.567 --> 08:13.534
In the middle of the night,

08:13.567 --> 08:15.901
Said there were people in her room,

08:15.933 --> 08:17.300
Scary people.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.367
And things were

08:18.400 --> 08:19.467
Constantly getting broken.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.534
I mean, paul and I both
thought it was just

08:22.567 --> 08:25.133
Cassidy's muscle spasms,
but she always blamed it

08:25.167 --> 08:27.434
On the other people in the house.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.801
I mean, we didn't
believe her until...

08:29.834 --> 08:33.100
Strange things started happening
to you and your husband.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.801
Yeah. Violent things...

08:34.833 --> 08:36.734
Uh, furniture falling over,

08:36.767 --> 08:38.801
Dishes flying off the shelves,

08:38.833 --> 08:41.066
Doors slamming...
usually around midnight,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.600
The same time Cassidy
would wake up.

08:44.534 --> 08:46.066
2 weeks after she died,

08:46.100 --> 08:48.066
Something pushed my
husband down the stairs,

08:48.100 --> 08:49.966
And we haven't been back since.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.200
Wait. Her ghost was
inside the mirror?

08:55.233 --> 08:57.801
Yeah. Not for long. It's like
she didn't wanna show herself,

08:57.834 --> 08:59.600
So she hid in the mirror.

08:59.634 --> 09:00.634
Wow. Here, mommy.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.133
Let me help. You and
daddy work too much.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.000
That's sweet. Good man.

09:05.966 --> 09:06.901
Wait a minute.

09:06.933 --> 09:09.434
So why would she haunt
her own parents,

09:09.467 --> 09:10.966
Especially so violently?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.434
I'm not even sure if it was her.

09:12.467 --> 09:13.700
I mean, she told her mother about

09:13.734 --> 09:14.901
People in the house, scary people.

09:14.966 --> 09:18.167
Apparently she would wake
up at midnight screaming.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.933
You know, maybe the ghosts
were stuck in some kind of loop

09:20.966 --> 09:22.801
Living the same experience
over and over again.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.200
There was noises, furniture moving,

09:25.233 --> 09:26.233
Things breaking. Aah!

09:26.267 --> 09:27.933
Oh. I'm sorry.

09:27.966 --> 09:29.767
Hey, you ok? Aiden, you all right?

09:29.801 --> 09:31.467
No, baby. It's ok.
It was an accident.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
No, it wasn't. My arms,

09:33.534 --> 09:34.901
They jerked.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.801
They moved on their own.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.867
That's just called a spasm, ok?

09:40.901 --> 09:44.300
Look, um, why don't I read to you
while you take your bath, huh?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.367
How's that sound, buddy?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.133
Ok.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.066
What happened?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.333
Oh, I...I think Aiden

09:55.367 --> 09:56.634
Is empathing Cassidy's illness.

09:56.667 --> 10:00.167
It'll be fine once I
get her into the light.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.634
Um, I failed you.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.667
There's nothing on
the peyton house.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.767
All the original plans
and deeds and titles

10:08.801 --> 10:12.734
And tax information was lost
in a fire at the city archives.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.867
Oh. The fire from 6 years ago?

10:14.901 --> 10:17.834
Actually, the first fire, 1945.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.467
Place has a knack for going
up in smoke, I guess.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.000
So there's no information
about the previous owner?

10:24.033 --> 10:26.033
The only thing I
could find was a lien

10:26.066 --> 10:28.467
That was placed on the
house by the irs in 1952

10:28.500 --> 10:32.033
With "unknown" written where
the owner's name should be

10:32.066 --> 10:34.634
And "deceased" stamped
on one of the pages.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.333
Anyway, the court put it up
for auction about 6 years ago.

10:38.367 --> 10:42.033
Donna and her husband were
the only ones who made a bid.

10:42.066 --> 10:45.400
They lived there for about 18 months,
and then they left.

10:45.434 --> 10:47.767
And that's all I could find, so...

10:47.801 --> 10:48.933
I'm sorry.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.333
Hey, you know, um,
you wanna have a glass of wine?

10:51.367 --> 10:53.534
I mean, we haven't had a
chance to talk about...

10:53.567 --> 10:57.634
The explosion that
almost killed me?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.901
Or you?

10:59.933 --> 11:01.066
Or Ned?

11:01.100 --> 11:03.734
Or the fact that Ned
has already been

11:03.767 --> 11:06.100
In the emergency
room twice this year

11:06.133 --> 11:07.834
Because of your ghosts?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.567
Delia... what?!

11:09.600 --> 11:14.100
I am sorry, Melinda,
but this is getting too dangerous.

11:14.133 --> 11:17.667
To what, be my friend?

11:18.901 --> 11:21.534
Let me ask you something.

11:21.567 --> 11:25.066
What happened to Ned
yesterday in that house,

11:25.100 --> 11:29.000
It sounds like Cassidy was
trying to scare him away, right?

11:29.033 --> 11:30.834
If it was even Cassidy. I'm not...

11:30.867 --> 11:32.400
Well, whoever it was, she said,

11:32.434 --> 11:35.467
"stay away,
or you will be dead, too."

11:35.500 --> 11:36.434
Ghosts are unreliable.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.033
You should know that by now.

11:38.066 --> 11:38.966
Really?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.534
Why don't you tell
that to the ghost

11:41.567 --> 11:46.100
That warned you that president
Bedford was gonna die in my office?

11:46.133 --> 11:49.167
Maybe you should start paying
attention to them for a change.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.000
Look, there is a scared little girl

11:51.033 --> 11:53.500
Who's locked in a house with angry,
dangerous ghosts.

11:53.534 --> 11:57.901
Yes, and this is all the more
reason for you not to get involved!

11:57.933 --> 12:01.133
Or for you to involve my son.

12:01.167 --> 12:04.133
Let this one go, Melinda.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.567
Please, let it go.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.933
I am begging you.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.933
You know I can't do that.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.734
Cassidy?

12:45.767 --> 12:48.966
If you're here, it's ok.
I can help you.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.734
Please...

13:03.767 --> 13:06.200
Just talk to me.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.033
You have to hurry.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.534
Cassidy?

13:15.567 --> 13:18.634
You don't have to hide from me.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.700
Whatever's keeping you here, I...

13:20.734 --> 13:23.966
I can help you go into the light.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.534
It's safe there.

13:26.933 --> 13:29.734
Oh, no. I'm not allowed.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.434
Of course you are.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.700
Did someone tell you that?

13:33.734 --> 13:35.267
We're alone now.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.834
Follow me.

14:14.434 --> 14:16.933
Cassidy?

14:39.100 --> 14:42.000
This hatbox...

14:42.033 --> 14:43.667
Is this what you wanted to show me?

14:43.700 --> 14:46.801
It's in there, but hurry.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.434
Right there, in that wall.

14:48.467 --> 14:50.867
Uh...

15:16.167 --> 15:17.300
Aah!

15:27.033 --> 15:28.167
All right, enough!

15:28.200 --> 15:30.901
Whoever you are,
just let Cassidy go.

15:30.933 --> 15:32.066
Get out.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.033
Hurry.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.600
Cassidy, who are you afraid of?

15:37.634 --> 15:40.966
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.300
Cassidy...

15:45.901 --> 15:47.267
Cassidy, wait!

16:13.100 --> 16:15.281
The ghosts don't want Cassidy
to go into the light.

16:15.281 --> 16:17.200
They told her she's not allowed to.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.000
Did you say, "ghosts," plural?

16:19.033 --> 16:22.122
Yeah. I think they're the scary
people her mom had been talking about.

16:22.122 --> 16:24.379
I felt their presence,
and it was angry.

16:24.379 --> 16:26.265
Enough to try to kill
you with a wheelchair?

16:26.265 --> 16:28.235
Apparently. Whoever they are,
they're hiding,

16:28.235 --> 16:31.027
And if we don't find out some history
about that house, we're stuck.

16:31.027 --> 16:32.573
This box is impossible.

16:32.573 --> 16:34.684
Yeah. I couldn't find anything
like it on the internet.

16:34.684 --> 16:37.612
Maybe the ghost...
s don't want you to open it.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.367
Cassidy does.
She's asking for our help.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.266
Why doesn't she just tell you

16:41.299 --> 16:43.133
Why the other ghosts
won't let her leave?

16:43.166 --> 16:45.299
Mm, because for some reason,
she's terrified of them.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.233
That makes two of us.

16:47.266 --> 16:49.633
This emblem looks familiar.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.400
Let me see.

16:52.899 --> 16:55.299
It's a raven, as in nevermore.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.966
Which is good advice for
visiting that house.

16:57.999 --> 17:00.199
It was a raven that flew at me.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.899
Do you think that means something?

17:01.932 --> 17:02.932
Sure. Any guesses?

17:02.966 --> 17:04.532
What's all that?

17:04.566 --> 17:07.400
Old receipts, all with
the same handwriting,

17:07.433 --> 17:09.031
All marked "services rendered,"

17:09.066 --> 17:12.867
All dating back before
1943 with no names.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.665
Services rendered?
What kind of services?

17:15.700 --> 17:18.633
Eh, we'll add that to
the list of questions.

17:18.665 --> 17:19.633
Photo negatives.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.233
Yeah. I couldn't see
what was on them.

17:22.266 --> 17:24.266
I have a scanner that
handles photo negatives.

17:24.299 --> 17:25.433
I'm on it.

17:25.465 --> 17:27.999
And what about the
toys in the attic?

17:28.031 --> 17:30.066
And Cassidy's mom
said she remembered

17:30.099 --> 17:31.932
Seeing children playing
in the yard, right?

17:31.966 --> 17:34.666
What, you think the ghosts
in the house are all kids?

17:34.700 --> 17:35.966
Why would they be so violent?

17:35.999 --> 17:37.700
I mean, first going
after you, then me.

17:42.199 --> 17:43.133
Hey.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.899
I'm gonna work from home after all.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.833
Hey, Ned, can I
talk to you, please?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.299
Yeah. Sure.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.099
I really don't want you involved

17:56.133 --> 17:57.733
With this anymore. It's dangerous.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.999
Mom, I know you're still freaked
out about the explosion,

18:01.032 --> 18:03.867
But I promise I can
take care of myself.

18:03.899 --> 18:05.333
No. I'm serious.

18:05.366 --> 18:08.633
I can't just bail on Melinda.

18:08.666 --> 18:11.233
How do you know?
You never even tried.

18:11.266 --> 18:12.833
Just say no this once.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.166
Say no.

18:14.199 --> 18:17.333
Just let me get one
good night's sleep, ok?

18:25.966 --> 18:27.566
Yeah, that... that's her.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.966
That's the old lady who used
to smile and wave at me.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.767
I remember feeling sorry for
her because of the wheelchair.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.533
There's something else
I have to tell you.

18:36.566 --> 18:40.700
My friends were able to
date the film stock, and...

18:40.733 --> 18:43.833
These photos were taken
in the early 1940s.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.600
That's when my father was born,
so that can't be the same woman I saw.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.966
Actually, it could.

18:51.999 --> 18:55.133
I think you were seeing her ghost.

18:58.899 --> 19:01.133
Um, since I was a little girl,

19:01.166 --> 19:06.500
I've...I've been able to
talk with a-and see ghosts.

19:07.966 --> 19:09.833
And you still see them?

19:09.867 --> 19:11.466
Most kids lose their gift

19:11.500 --> 19:14.500
Around the same time they
stop believing in magic.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.500
I didn't.

19:20.932 --> 19:24.800
So Cassidy was seeing ghosts.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.966
Apparently you were, too.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.867
As a kid, I mean.

19:28.899 --> 19:31.333
The house hasn't been
occupied since 1952,

19:31.366 --> 19:34.466
So I think the children
you saw were ghosts

19:34.500 --> 19:37.299
And they're still there.

19:39.533 --> 19:42.600
All those nights,
she was so terrified,

19:42.633 --> 19:46.966
And we didn't believe her,
just told her to go back to bed.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.299
Oh, she must have felt so alone.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.533
You couldn't have known.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.566
And I'm afraid that there's more.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.867
I've talked to Cassidy,

19:53.899 --> 19:57.066
And she's still there.

19:57.099 --> 19:58.833
What? She...she is?

19:58.867 --> 20:00.466
Did she die there?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.299
No. No, the hospital.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.800
Ok. Well, then something
brought her back,

20:03.833 --> 20:05.099
And it must be that woman.

20:05.133 --> 20:09.600
Wait. Are you telling me my...
my little girl

20:09.633 --> 20:11.932
Is trapped there by that old lady,

20:11.966 --> 20:13.600
But why? Who...who was she?

20:13.633 --> 20:14.600
We don't know.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.266
All we have is the
last name hanson.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.733
You can see it

20:19.767 --> 20:22.233
Right there on the mail slot.

20:22.266 --> 20:25.099
I...I don't... I don't understand.

20:25.133 --> 20:27.767
Spirits are supposed
to go into the light,

20:27.800 --> 20:29.999
But for some reason, in this house,

20:30.032 --> 20:32.733
They don't want your
daughter to cross over.

20:32.767 --> 20:36.099
Are they, um...
are they hurting her?

20:36.133 --> 20:37.566
Is that even possible?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.400
There's still a lot to figure out.

20:40.433 --> 20:43.500
But whatever it is,
I will bring her peace.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.932
I promise.

20:48.733 --> 20:51.400
Mm. Mm! That's defense.

20:51.433 --> 20:53.533
Huh? Right? Hmm.

20:53.566 --> 20:54.566
Heh.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
Hello.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.833
Hey. How'd it go with Donna?

20:58.867 --> 20:59.800
She believe you?

20:59.833 --> 21:01.466
I had pretty convincing evidence.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.466
Hey, what you got there, baby?

21:03.500 --> 21:05.133
You left it on the table.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.199
Am I in trouble?

21:06.233 --> 21:08.099
No. Of course not. It looks like

21:08.133 --> 21:09.700
You made more
progress than anybody.

21:09.733 --> 21:10.767
It's pretty cool.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.166
And remember,
don't call me baby anymore.

21:13.199 --> 21:15.533
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.833
So Delia moved her stuff
out of the store today,

21:18.867 --> 21:20.800
Said she'd rather work from home.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.099
Ah. Think she's still
pretty rattled, huh?

21:23.133 --> 21:25.233
Yeah. I can't say that I blame her.

21:25.266 --> 21:26.899
Wha...

21:26.932 --> 21:28.666
You ok, man? What's going on?

21:28.700 --> 21:30.433
My arms again.

21:31.785 --> 21:33.027
You know what?

21:33.027 --> 21:34.473
I-it's just Cassidy, ok?

21:34.473 --> 21:36.461
It's gonna be over soon, I promise.

21:41.235 --> 21:43.698
Um, do you want some cocoa?

21:43.698 --> 21:45.083
Yeah, pal. Why don't I make it?

21:45.083 --> 21:45.759
Ok.

21:45.759 --> 21:46.833
Come on.

22:05.147 --> 22:08.966
Mel. Hey, what's going on?
What's wrong?

22:08.999 --> 22:10.966
I just saw people being murdered.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.967
The other ghosts in
the house, right?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.368
I think those were
locks of their hair.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.156
Why would that lady keep
them hidden in her house?

22:21.156 --> 22:24.101
Because she doesn't
want anybody to know.

22:25.101 --> 22:27.034
Look, didn't Cassidy warn you

22:27.067 --> 22:30.268
That if you didn't stay away from there,
you'd be dead, too?

22:30.301 --> 22:32.634
Yeah, but she's the one
who just showed me those.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.167
It's like she's warning me again.

22:34.201 --> 22:35.400
About the old woman?

22:35.433 --> 22:38.667
Maybe those are souvenirs
from other ghosts.

22:39.889 --> 22:41.869
Maybe she murderred them all.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.367
Cassidy.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.167
Cassidy, I know about
the other ghosts.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.366
If they're keeping you here,
I can help you.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.974
What is this?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.600
Did you bring the tribute?

23:12.634 --> 23:14.033
Thank you.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.100
And the embodiment?

23:17.166 --> 23:18.600
Excellent.

23:18.634 --> 23:21.400
I already sense her.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.300
Now place your hands flat

23:24.333 --> 23:26.634
On the table in front of you.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.734
Mine will stay constrained

23:28.767 --> 23:29.700
Throughout the session

23:29.734 --> 23:32.467
To prove there's no trickery.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.467
Let us begin.

23:35.867 --> 23:39.367
Denizens of the spirit world...

23:40.934 --> 23:43.133
Your loved ones call you tonight

23:43.166 --> 23:45.834
Not to disturb you from
your troubled sleep,

23:45.867 --> 23:48.967
But to help you find peace.

23:49.001 --> 23:52.700
Tonight we call Naomi,

23:52.734 --> 23:54.634
Beloved daughter

23:54.667 --> 23:58.100
Of Virgil and Esther.

23:58.133 --> 23:59.367
A seance.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.133
Are you kidding me?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.333
Naomi, will you come to us?

24:06.267 --> 24:08.667
Are you Naomi?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.133
They killed me.

24:12.166 --> 24:16.066
Naomi, will you give us a
sign that you're with us?

24:16.100 --> 24:17.967
They killed me!

24:18.001 --> 24:22.901
No. No, you're upsetting her.

24:25.934 --> 24:27.767
Naomi is with us now.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.500
She wants you to know
her death came quickly.

24:31.534 --> 24:34.066
Stop! You're lying! She's gone!

24:37.433 --> 24:39.634
She says she loves you.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.200
She's going into the light now.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.834
Stop it!

24:57.567 --> 25:00.100
She lied to us

25:00.133 --> 25:02.700
And our families.

25:02.734 --> 25:05.867
There was never any light.

25:13.367 --> 25:15.433
Dream?

25:15.467 --> 25:19.734
That old woman was pretending to
be a medium when she was alive.

25:19.767 --> 25:24.300
I was a ghost at one of her seances,
if you can believe that.

25:24.333 --> 25:27.800
Ok, her name is Greta hanson,
also known as madame Greta.

25:27.834 --> 25:30.333
She set up shop in
Grandview in 1924

25:30.367 --> 25:31.734
During the whole
spiritualism revival.

25:31.767 --> 25:34.901
She died in 1943 when her
wheelchair rolled down the stairs.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.500
More likely a ghost pushed her.

25:36.534 --> 25:37.767
Where'd you get this?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.967
I spent hours searching
"hanson" plus "spiritualism"

25:40.001 --> 25:41.133
And "medium" and "seance"

25:41.166 --> 25:42.400
And found exactly nothing.

25:42.433 --> 25:45.367
Professor grant gave
me the t.A. Job.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.300
I now have full access to the
copeland wing at the library.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.267
I hate you.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.734
Madame Greta operated
under the radar,

25:51.767 --> 25:54.033
Held her sessions in a secret room,

25:54.066 --> 25:57.100
Worked strictly by private referral,
and made a killing,

25:57.133 --> 25:58.100
So to speak.

25:58.133 --> 25:59.100
Yeah, off the suffering

25:59.133 --> 26:00.600
Of grieving people and
frustrated ghosts.

26:00.634 --> 26:02.567
She must have been
pretty convincing.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.267
Harry houdini even attended
one of her seances,

26:05.300 --> 26:07.233
But never publicly debunked her.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.834
Yeah, probably because,
according to Melinda,

26:08.867 --> 26:10.333
She was able to attract ghosts,

26:10.367 --> 26:12.600
But she just couldn't actually
communicate with them.

26:12.634 --> 26:14.500
So the murder visions
that Melinda had,

26:14.534 --> 26:17.734
Could the old woman have been
a medium and a serial killer?

26:17.767 --> 26:20.467
You know, so she'd always
have fresh ghosts to contact?

26:20.500 --> 26:24.867
Maybe not. Melinda said a man at
the seance brought a lock of hair.

26:24.901 --> 26:27.333
As an embodiment.
Mediums sometimes asked

26:27.367 --> 26:29.500
For something personal
from the deceased.

26:29.534 --> 26:33.433
And the ghost in Melinda's dream said,
"they killed me."

26:33.467 --> 26:36.233
Yeah. Mel said she looked
like she'd been strangled.

26:36.267 --> 26:39.433
So maybe madame Greta specialized
in contacting murder victims.

26:39.467 --> 26:42.233
Ok, so the ghosts
aren't kids after all,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.867
But what happened to the
children that Cassidy's mom saw?

26:44.901 --> 26:46.133
And why is Cassidy stuck

26:46.166 --> 26:48.233
In a house with a bunch
of murdered people?

26:48.267 --> 26:49.667
Ahh. You're giving me a headache.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.634
Sounds like a good time to
go and chat with some ghosts.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.066
A field trip to the
house of whacked spirits

26:56.100 --> 26:58.100
At the witching hour?
Thank you, no.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.267
Besides, your mom said
ghosts are off limits.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.901
I know, but since I can't
talk to them anyhow

27:02.934 --> 27:05.667
A-and I know you're not gonna
let Melinda go alone...

27:05.700 --> 27:07.700
Ok. I'll call her.

27:09.934 --> 27:11.467
Jim finally got Aiden to sleep,

27:11.500 --> 27:13.700
So we should get going.
Do we even have a plan?

27:13.734 --> 27:16.133
Yeah. Our first priority is
to get her out of that house

27:16.166 --> 27:17.934
And convince her to cross
over into the light.

27:17.967 --> 27:19.901
But we don't even know
what we're up against.

27:19.934 --> 27:21.233
We have madame Greta,
murder victims.

27:21.267 --> 27:22.934
Who knows how many?

27:22.967 --> 27:24.967
And if they're all just trying
to keep Cassidy there...

27:25.001 --> 27:28.600
Trust me. When she sees her mommy,
she's gonna come to us.

27:28.634 --> 27:30.400
Let's go.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.200
I told you to stay away.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.166
Cassidy?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.734
Cassidy, you're here.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.500
Look. Let me call your mommy.

27:41.534 --> 27:42.834
I have to go.

27:42.867 --> 27:45.100
I'll get in trouble
for talking to you.

27:45.133 --> 27:47.934
From who? Who are you afraid of?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.233
Them.

27:55.233 --> 27:56.634
She's looking for her.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.100
She's angry.

27:58.133 --> 27:59.233
Who, madame Greta?

27:59.267 --> 28:01.033
Who are you?

28:02.133 --> 28:04.333
What is it, chains?

28:04.367 --> 28:05.700
What's going on?

28:05.734 --> 28:07.066
You were both in prison.

28:07.100 --> 28:09.066
She's coming.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.333
Cassidy, hurry.

28:11.367 --> 28:13.534
No, no! Wait!

28:14.433 --> 28:15.400
They're gone.

28:15.433 --> 28:17.033
You said they were prisoners?

28:17.066 --> 28:20.100
Yeah. And they both had
burns and lacerations,

28:20.133 --> 28:22.133
Like they'd been executed.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.300
You know, the visions
I had of...of murders,

28:24.333 --> 28:26.500
Maybe it wasn't from the victim.

28:26.534 --> 28:28.734
What if I was seeing it all
through the killer's eyes?

28:28.767 --> 28:29.496
Wait a minute.

28:29.496 --> 28:33.143
Are you saying all the other
ghosts in the house are murderers?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.792
The ghosts of murderers?

28:42.792 --> 28:44.731
And they're keeping Cassidy
trapped in that house?

28:44.731 --> 28:46.385
I don't know if they are murderers.

28:46.385 --> 28:48.694
I mean, we ided them by the
numbers on their uniform.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.135
They were convicted in the twenties,
executed in the thirties,

28:51.135 --> 28:52.831
And since then,
they'd been proven innocent.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.675
You saw people being killed,
didn't you?

28:54.675 --> 28:58.444
I know. Which means that they're
not the only ghosts in that house.

28:58.444 --> 29:00.763
I mean, Ned told me that
madame Greta's brother

29:00.763 --> 29:03.778
Was hanged for murder.
She went into spiritualism

29:03.778 --> 29:05.579
To try to prove that
he was innocent,

29:05.600 --> 29:07.834
And it became her
specialty as a medium.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.951
She didn't even have the gift.

29:10.951 --> 29:13.408
All she did was attract hundreds
of ghosts to that house,

29:13.408 --> 29:15.667
Murderers and people who
were wrongfully executed.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.967
Wait. So the innocent
ones are still there.

29:18.001 --> 29:19.333
Where are the guilty ones?

29:19.367 --> 29:21.467
Hiding from me, or maybe
they went into the light.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.200
And the innocent ones didn't.
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

29:24.233 --> 29:25.433
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense,

29:25.467 --> 29:26.900
But there's gotta be
some kind of good reason.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.266
Yeah. Oh, wait.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.056
You know, executions are
usually scheduled at midnight.

29:31.056 --> 29:33.071
That might have something to do
with the timing of your hauntings.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.867
Yeah, but not why they won't
let Cassidy cross over.

29:37.533 --> 29:38.967
I'll be right back.

29:39.001 --> 29:41.067
All right. Hey.

29:44.767 --> 29:45.967
You can't help her.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.200
I don't believe that.

29:47.233 --> 29:49.001
The two of you who appeared to me,

29:49.034 --> 29:50.300
You were innocent, weren't you?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.834
Why didn't you go into the light?

29:55.867 --> 29:58.367
We won't leave Cassidy.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.767
We can't.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.734
You're protecting her?

30:02.767 --> 30:04.200
And you.

30:04.233 --> 30:06.600
From what? The ghosts?

30:06.634 --> 30:08.200
The ones who were guilty?

30:08.233 --> 30:12.900
Yes, but they aren't
ghosts anymore.

30:12.934 --> 30:14.767
Wh-what are you...

30:38.266 --> 30:39.900
There, my sweet.

30:39.934 --> 30:45.533
Soon you can come play with all the
lovely toys at my house forever.

30:45.567 --> 30:50.101
You and my friend Cassidy
here will have such fun.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.367
You'll see.

30:59.767 --> 31:00.900
Are you home?

31:00.934 --> 31:03.500
No. I'm in Eli's office
doing a little research.

31:03.533 --> 31:05.700
Is it econ, or are you
still helping out Melinda?

31:05.734 --> 31:07.233
Mom, this one's huge.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.800
Melinda needs all the
help she can get.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.067
Ned, we talked about this.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.400
I know, but this is amazing.

31:11.433 --> 31:13.533
This house is full of ghosts,
and for some reason,

31:13.567 --> 31:16.001
They won't let this poor
little girl go into the light.

31:16.034 --> 31:18.533
Listen, it is great
that you care about her

31:18.567 --> 31:21.045
And that you found something that
you're passionate about, but, Ned,

31:21.045 --> 31:21.600
Listen to me.

31:21.634 --> 31:24.567
A ghost kidnapped Aiden.
Another one killed president Bedford.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.834
You have been hurt twice.
When are you gonna understand

31:27.867 --> 31:30.001
This is too dangerous?

31:33.634 --> 31:36.834
Apparently more dangerous
than even Melinda realizes.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.200
What?

31:38.233 --> 31:39.166
Mom, I gotta go.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.834
I'll call you from
the car and explain.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.700
No, no, no...

31:42.734 --> 31:45.400
Ned. Ned, hold...

31:45.433 --> 31:47.166
Hello?

31:48.300 --> 31:50.001
Aiden, it's way past your...

31:50.034 --> 31:52.034
Bedtime.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.800
Aiden.

31:59.133 --> 32:02.600
I know where your boy
is all the time. Do you?

32:02.634 --> 32:04.567
Don't you dare threaten my son.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.700
They stay out of my business.

32:15.834 --> 32:18.634
Ned, hey. Tell us what's going on.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.133
I found out what the raven means,

32:20.166 --> 32:21.433
The one on the puzzle box.

32:21.467 --> 32:22.700
Ok, in the "book of changes"?

32:22.734 --> 32:24.233
First I asked professor
grant about it.

32:24.266 --> 32:25.800
She said that an emblem like this

32:25.834 --> 32:26.800
On a tombstone represents

32:26.834 --> 32:27.967
A guardian of the soul.

32:28.001 --> 32:29.867
What's that have to
do with the book?

32:29.900 --> 32:31.001
I'll show you.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.367
The book must have erased it.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.433
Doesn't it only do that when
it's worried about the shadows?

32:39.467 --> 32:41.467
Yeah, and if it has something
to do with the shadows,

32:41.500 --> 32:42.667
That explains a few things.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.400
One of the prisoners told
me that the other convicts

32:44.433 --> 32:46.166
Are in the house,
but they're not ghosts anymore.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.367
But how could they be
there and not be ghosts?

32:48.400 --> 32:50.700
If they change into shadows.

32:50.734 --> 32:52.500
All right, help me out.

32:52.533 --> 32:54.034
It's what the shinies told Aiden...

32:54.067 --> 32:55.834
Or what he saw happening
to Julia. Right.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.764
Shadows, they prey on your guilt.

32:57.764 --> 32:59.061
They break your spirit apart,

32:59.061 --> 33:00.006
And they feed on the pieces.

33:00.006 --> 33:01.718
You know, I think I've seen
something like this before,

33:01.718 --> 33:03.049
But I just didn't know what it was,

33:03.049 --> 33:05.391
These dark, angry ghosts
that don't really cross over.

33:05.391 --> 33:07.277
They more cross under.

33:07.277 --> 33:08.238
Maybe that's the shadows.

33:08.238 --> 33:09.516
Maybe that's how they multiply.

33:09.516 --> 33:10.712
Yeah, and these are just

33:10.712 --> 33:12.536
Especially interested in children.

33:12.536 --> 33:14.388
But if shadows exploit your guilt,

33:14.388 --> 33:16.030
Why are they so
caught up on Cassidy?

33:16.030 --> 33:17.900
What does she have to
be so guilty about?

33:17.934 --> 33:19.166
I don't know.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.467
Maybe nothing.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.467
Maybe that's why she's still here.

33:23.567 --> 33:25.467
Jim, help me pack
up everything shiny.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.567
And don't let Aiden out
of your sight, ok? Ok.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.734
And can you call Eli?
I'll meet you guys at the house.

33:29.767 --> 33:31.333
I'm gonna call Cassidy's
mom on the way.

33:31.367 --> 33:32.834
Melinda, be careful.

33:32.867 --> 33:35.067
Yeah.

33:38.001 --> 33:39.333
What's going on?

33:39.367 --> 33:40.867
Is Cassidy here?

33:40.900 --> 33:42.400
I need you to talk to her,

33:42.433 --> 33:44.900
Tell her that it's
safe to come outside.

33:44.934 --> 33:47.233
We don't have a lot of time.

33:50.433 --> 33:51.800
Cass-Cassidy.

33:51.834 --> 33:52.934
Sweetie.

33:53.834 --> 33:55.233
You could come out.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.934
It's ok. Please?

33:56.967 --> 33:59.266
Mommy.

34:00.967 --> 34:05.067
Mommy, you shouldn't be here.

34:05.101 --> 34:07.200
It's ok. All right?
We're safe for now.

34:07.233 --> 34:09.500
Look, she's here.
I'll explain later,

34:09.533 --> 34:11.233
But we have to hurry.

34:11.266 --> 34:15.934
I...I wish I could see
her one last time.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.766
Don't be sad, mommy.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.600
She doesn't want you to be sad.

34:20.634 --> 34:23.067
How could I not be?

34:23.101 --> 34:25.166
If we had just listened to her

34:25.199 --> 34:27.500
When she told us about
the scary people,

34:27.533 --> 34:29.266
We would have left
this house sooner.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.800
Will you...will you tell her that?

34:30.833 --> 34:32.699
She can hear you.

34:36.433 --> 34:39.634
Can you ever forgive us?

34:39.667 --> 34:41.934
I was never mad at you.

34:41.967 --> 34:44.300
She was never angry with you.

34:45.433 --> 34:48.067
Look, Cassidy,
I have to ask you something.

34:48.101 --> 34:51.867
Madame Greta, she brings children
here for a reason, doesn't she?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.734
It's ok.

34:53.766 --> 34:55.500
You can tell the truth.
She isn't here.

34:55.533 --> 34:59.133
But she said if I told anyone,
I'd be punished.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.867
She can't hurt you. All right?

35:01.900 --> 35:05.333
And the other ghosts,
the lady and the man,

35:05.367 --> 35:07.133
They were protecting you,
weren't they?

35:07.166 --> 35:08.834
We protect each other

35:08.867 --> 35:11.767
Whenever the cold things come.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.333
The shadows.

35:14.367 --> 35:17.233
Yeah. I felt that cold before.

35:17.266 --> 35:19.533
So how do you protect each other?

35:19.567 --> 35:22.400
We make a circle
so they'll go away,

35:22.433 --> 35:23.967
But they always come back,

35:24.001 --> 35:25.734
And they're getting stronger.

35:25.767 --> 35:27.600
So that's why you
didn't wanna leave?

35:27.634 --> 35:30.967
Because you were afraid that the cold
things would take your friends away?

35:31.001 --> 35:33.101
Like they did to the others,

35:33.133 --> 35:35.133
All of them.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.300
The children, too?

35:37.365 --> 35:40.487
Look, it's not safe for
you to be here, ok?

35:40.487 --> 35:42.034
Do you see a light?

35:43.266 --> 35:44.629
No.

35:44.629 --> 35:46.521
What is it? Does she see the light?

35:46.521 --> 35:48.307
No.

35:49.863 --> 35:52.568
Please, just tell her that it's ok.

35:52.568 --> 35:53.800
Tell her to see the light.

35:53.834 --> 35:55.001
You can go with her.

35:55.034 --> 35:57.101
Both of you.

35:59.166 --> 36:02.333
Cassidy, you've helped
us stay safe for so long.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.934
Now you have to help yourself.

36:04.967 --> 36:06.233
Ok?

36:11.834 --> 36:14.034
That's pretty.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.467
My friends can come, too?

36:16.500 --> 36:17.734
Really?

36:17.767 --> 36:19.067
She sees the light.

36:19.101 --> 36:21.734
Look, all of you just go.

36:21.767 --> 36:23.166
Ok? It's where you belong,

36:23.200 --> 36:25.200
And you're gonna be safe there,
I...I promise.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.166
I love you, mommy.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.600
She says she loves you.

36:48.367 --> 36:51.034
Cassidy! No!

37:09.000 --> 37:10.533
Sorry. We got here
as fast as we could.

37:10.566 --> 37:11.533
Did Cassidy cross over?

37:11.566 --> 37:12.773
No. What?

37:12.773 --> 37:13.915
Madame Greta stopped her,

37:13.915 --> 37:17.200
And I think she's just
getting warmed up.

37:24.131 --> 37:26.268
Cassidy? What is it?
What's going on?

37:26.268 --> 37:27.334
It's ok. I'll explain later.

37:27.367 --> 37:30.000
Ned, put all these
things by the windows.

37:30.034 --> 37:31.667
Eli, open the blinds.
They don't like light.

37:31.700 --> 37:35.000
Hurry up, and whatever you do,
do not turn these things off.

37:35.034 --> 37:36.167
Can count on that.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.234
Open the ones in front, too.

37:39.267 --> 37:41.466
I'm on it.

37:41.500 --> 37:46.100
Cassidy, it's ok for
you to come back.

37:46.134 --> 37:47.401
Cassidy.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.167
Cassidy.

37:50.733 --> 37:54.367
You said we could go. You promised.

37:54.401 --> 37:57.500
Look, do you see the light?
Is it still open?

37:57.533 --> 37:59.700
Yes, but I'm scared.

37:59.733 --> 38:01.566
There's nothing for
you to be scared of.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.500
You just go,
ok? It's gonna be fine.

38:03.533 --> 38:04.533
Tell her.

38:04.566 --> 38:05.600
Cassidy!

38:05.633 --> 38:09.067
I-it's ok. Do what Melinda says.

38:13.967 --> 38:15.533
It's too late!

38:18.367 --> 38:19.301
They're here,

38:19.334 --> 38:21.466
And they're angry with you.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.000
Get out while you can.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.633
No. I am not leaving until
you guys go into the light.

38:25.667 --> 38:26.833
Oh, boy.

38:29.866 --> 38:31.433
Just stay here.

38:35.934 --> 38:38.267
We did nothing wrong.

38:38.301 --> 38:39.967
We did nothing wrong.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.100
We did nothing wrong.

38:42.134 --> 38:43.934
We did nothing wrong.

38:43.967 --> 38:45.967
We did nothing wrong.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.934
We did nothing wrong.

38:47.967 --> 38:49.833
We did nothing wrong.

38:49.867 --> 38:51.633
We did nothing wrong.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.800
We did nothing wrong.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.134
We did nothing wrong.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.563
We did nothing wrong...

38:56.563 --> 38:58.199
The child stays with me.

38:58.199 --> 39:00.833
No. No. All you've
been doing is using her

39:00.867 --> 39:02.967
To lure other ghosts here.
That's over.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.200
Cassidy's too naughty
to go into the light.

39:06.234 --> 39:07.733
She tricked all those
other little ghosts.

39:07.767 --> 39:09.600
We, we! That's a lie.

39:09.633 --> 39:11.667
Don't listen to her! Cassidy,
she's just saying that

39:11.700 --> 39:13.934
To make you feel bad for
something you didn't do.

39:13.967 --> 39:15.334
She couldn't stand being alone,

39:15.367 --> 39:18.500
So she lied to those other
ghosts so she could have friends.

39:18.533 --> 39:20.234
That's why the light's not for her.

39:20.267 --> 39:21.633
She doesn't deserve it.

39:21.667 --> 39:22.600
I don't?

39:22.633 --> 39:24.200
No, Cassidy, don't listen to her.

39:24.234 --> 39:25.167
Listen to your friends.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.002
You did nothing wrong.

39:27.002 --> 39:28.002
You did nothing wrong.

39:28.035 --> 39:30.035
You did nothing wrong.

39:30.069 --> 39:31.435
You did nothing wrong.

39:31.468 --> 39:32.468
You did nothing wrong.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.035
We need more shiny stuff.

39:35.654 --> 39:36.890
There's silver everywhere.

39:36.890 --> 39:38.484
Grab it and spread it around.

39:40.455 --> 39:42.082
Look!

39:47.835 --> 39:49.435
The shadows, they blocked us in!

39:50.435 --> 39:52.635
Move it! Hurry!

39:52.668 --> 39:53.802
It won't budge!

39:53.835 --> 39:55.869
You did nothing wrong.

39:55.902 --> 39:58.102
Cassidy, you didn't do anything wrong.
Don't you understand?

39:58.136 --> 40:01.169
That's why the shadows haven't taken you,
because you're innocent.

40:01.202 --> 40:02.802
Stop interfering.
Get out of my house!

40:02.835 --> 40:05.635
Now!

40:07.969 --> 40:09.769
The shadows are killing the lights,
even the headlights!

40:11.902 --> 40:14.102
You know what? The only
one guilty here is you.

40:14.136 --> 40:16.702
Ok, you took advantage of
people when you were alive,

40:16.735 --> 40:17.735
But you were lying,

40:17.769 --> 40:19.169
And all you were doing

40:19.202 --> 40:21.268
Was bringing tortured
souls back to the shadows.

40:21.301 --> 40:22.435
That's enough.

40:22.468 --> 40:24.102
Now you're feeding them children

40:24.136 --> 40:26.169
Because it's either them or you.

40:26.202 --> 40:27.735
Be quiet!

40:31.735 --> 40:33.301
What?

40:34.236 --> 40:36.202
What is that?

40:36.236 --> 40:38.002
The headlights,
they're coming back on.

40:45.102 --> 40:46.602
Cassidy, go!

40:46.635 --> 40:49.335
Go right now!

40:50.335 --> 40:52.635
Tell mommy and daddy I love them!

40:52.668 --> 40:54.568
I promise! Go! Run, Cassidy!

40:57.136 --> 40:59.136
Cassidy!

40:59.169 --> 41:02.035
No!

41:06.002 --> 41:08.035
I'll find more for you,
hundreds of them!

41:08.069 --> 41:11.735
All the children you need! Just,
please, I beg you!

41:11.769 --> 41:13.301
Oh, no!

41:13.335 --> 41:15.368
Oh, no!

41:28.969 --> 41:32.169
Help me move this stuff.

41:32.202 --> 41:33.335
Ned, Melinda! Oh, my god.

41:33.368 --> 41:34.205
Are you ok?

41:34.205 --> 41:35.517
Delia!

41:38.902 --> 41:40.869
I am now.

41:51.935 --> 41:54.969
Wait. So Greta had some kind
of deal with the shadows?

41:55.002 --> 41:57.735
She fed them ghosts,
and they didn't feed on her?

41:57.769 --> 41:58.835
Apparently.

41:58.869 --> 42:00.969
There's only one thing
I don't understand.

42:01.002 --> 42:02.002
What got into you?

42:02.574 --> 42:04.696
Showing up all Nick of time,

42:04.696 --> 42:06.218
Like, heroic and stuff?

42:06.218 --> 42:08.069
Please. I'm no hero.

42:08.069 --> 42:10.396
Somebody's gotta
look after you guys.

42:10.735 --> 42:13.434
The trouble is my
lunatic son is a hero,

42:13.434 --> 42:15.715
So what am I supposed to do?

42:15.735 --> 42:19.069
Be a hero, too.

42:21.459 --> 42:23.389
Ok, maybe just this once.

42:23.389 --> 42:25.002
But don't get used to it.

42:25.002 --> 42:26.037
Real estate is my business.

42:26.037 --> 42:27.702
This heroing...

42:31.678 --> 42:34.006
Ned learned everything from you.

42:41.445 --> 42:44.904
Would you promise just to be careful,
for god's sake?

42:44.904 --> 42:47.320
Right, kid. Listen to
your mother, all right?

42:47.990 --> 42:49.735
And you, too.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.735
What's wrong?

42:57.448 --> 43:01.454
I just wish we knew what was so
important about children's ghosts.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.720
What do the shadows want with them?
