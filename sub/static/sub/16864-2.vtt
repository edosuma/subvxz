WEBVTT

00:01.531 --> 00:03.248
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:05.107 --> 00:07.784
I saw you go. I watched the struggle.

00:07.993 --> 00:09.961
There was something that you saw
that scared the shit out of you,

00:10.028 --> 00:11.785
and I want to know what that was.

00:11.905 --> 00:14.830
- Why couldn't you save us, Tommy?
- You said you'd come back to get me.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.267
Ooh! Honey.

00:16.622 --> 00:19.070
I've been on my own this
whole goddamn time. Well,

00:19.138 --> 00:22.640
except for the guys.
Thank God for them. Franco... he was a

00:22.708 --> 00:26.210
godsend. He was amazing.
He baby-sat for me. He helped Katy

00:26.278 --> 00:29.647
with her homework.
You know, you name it, he did it.

00:29.715 --> 00:32.583
Did you go by my house a couple
times while I was laid up?

00:32.651 --> 00:34.318
A couple of times? Yeah.
I was there almost every day.

00:34.386 --> 00:36.978
Do me a favor. In the future
if something happens to be,

00:37.098 --> 00:38.923
anything happens, just
don't go to my house.

00:38.991 --> 00:42.580
This city is in a goddamn recession.

00:42.700 --> 00:46.130
The Mayor's gonna have to close
a couple of firehouses. The word I hear is

00:46.198 --> 00:49.500
that this house is
number one on the list.

00:49.568 --> 00:51.636
This one's allowed to
drink in the house now.

00:51.703 --> 00:52.503
What?

00:52.571 --> 00:55.139
Don't worry.
I don't have a drinking problem.

00:55.207 --> 00:56.974
It is genetic.

00:57.042 --> 00:58.609
So is being a bitch, bitch.

00:58.677 --> 01:00.787
- I want Damien out.
- Out of what?

01:00.806 --> 01:02.777
This. The job.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.081
What about his father's legacy?

01:04.149 --> 01:06.773
This father ain't here, is he?

01:07.058 --> 01:09.709
His father only shows up
in old home movies

01:09.746 --> 01:11.848
and your goddamn fever dreams.

01:11.968 --> 01:15.880
I am interested in my legacy
and I want him out now.

Hi.

01:58.603 --> 01:59.403
Hi, daddy.

01:59.471 --> 02:00.571
Hey, Tom. What's up, man?

02:00.638 --> 02:02.373
What did the doctor say?

02:02.440 --> 02:05.542
He said I can go back
to work in a week.

02:05.610 --> 02:07.845
Cool. Yeah.
More like 3 weeks.

02:07.912 --> 02:08.946
Ha ha!

02:09.013 --> 02:12.783
Hmm. Am I dreaming, or are
you sitting in my kitchen

02:12.851 --> 02:15.085
without a shirt on?
I'm assuming you're wearing pants.

02:15.153 --> 02:17.788
Oh, yeah. I got pants on this
time, but, no, no shirt.

02:18.119 --> 02:20.591
Uncle Franco was just helping
me with my homework.

02:20.658 --> 02:23.260
Uh, the baby puked on my shirt
while I was burping him.

02:23.328 --> 02:25.863
No offense, Tom, but I couldn't
fit into any of yours, so...

02:25.930 --> 02:28.232
Uncle Franco's got a lot of muscles.

02:28.299 --> 02:29.400
Heh. Stop.

02:29.467 --> 02:30.667
Ha!

02:30.735 --> 02:35.686
Huh. Yeah. I've been in the
hospital for... So I haven't been

02:35.806 --> 02:38.308
in the... you know, I can help
my daughter with her homework.

02:38.376 --> 02:40.409
Here. Why don't you just go
put one of my jackets on or something?

02:40.462 --> 02:41.553
Yeah. I tried.
They don't fit.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.896
Yeah. Ok. Well, look at this.
See what we got here.

02:45.016 --> 02:46.950
Ahh.
What are we looking at, huh?

02:47.070 --> 02:48.449
Spanish.

02:48.707 --> 02:51.555
Yes, we are.

02:53.657 --> 02:55.813
Why don't you help her
with the Spanish?

02:55.933 --> 02:57.940
I'll go... I think I got an old bunker jacket
in one of my closets.

02:58.060 --> 02:58.863
I'll dig it out for you.

02:58.983 --> 02:59.822
All right.

03:00.363 --> 03:01.728
What's going on?

03:03.906 --> 03:07.237
Ok. How much can one baby puke, guys?
What's going on?

03:07.305 --> 03:09.907
Oh, no. This wasn't the baby.
This was Colleen.

03:09.974 --> 03:11.354
- Uh-huh.
- I think it was something she ate.

03:11.474 --> 03:13.504
You know, we had some
Chinese food last night.

03:13.624 --> 03:17.314
Them egg rolls, man,
got the best of her. Crazy, right?

03:17.382 --> 03:18.949
Yeah?

03:19.017 --> 03:23.320
What? She ain't drinking,
Tommy, all right? Just relax.

03:23.388 --> 03:25.303
- Not yet anyways.
- Jeez.

03:25.423 --> 03:26.889
- Uncle Shawn?
- Yeah?

03:27.009 --> 03:28.992
- What muscles are those?
- Enough.

03:29.112 --> 03:30.840
You know what? Okay...

03:31.086 --> 03:32.517
We're gonna have
a new policy in the house,

03:32.637 --> 03:34.533
which is no touching the muscles,
number one.

03:34.653 --> 03:35.632
Number two,

03:35.752 --> 03:39.584
does the underwear have to be hanging
all the way out of the pants with you?

03:39.704 --> 03:40.804
Here you go. Clean and dry.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.440
Ooh! Nice! Nice, nice, nice.

03:43.508 --> 03:46.076
Calm down, Tom, OK?
Without these two, this place would

03:46.144 --> 03:47.911
have been an insane asylum
while you were gone.

03:47.979 --> 03:48.645
Ok. All right.

03:48.713 --> 03:50.247
And, Franco, I thought I
told you to bring an extra

03:50.315 --> 03:52.202
- shirt the last time this happened.
- I know, I know.

03:52.705 --> 03:54.518
Oh, my gosh, Tom.
You should have seen last time.

03:54.586 --> 03:55.552
Whoa, Jan, I'm stuck.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.289
Oh, here. Wyatt puked on
his shirt and his lap.

03:59.357 --> 04:00.357
Ha ha ha!

04:00.425 --> 04:01.784
Heh heh heh.

04:03.728 --> 04:06.759
- I need to see you two out on the porch.
- Right now?

04:06.879 --> 04:08.699
Yeah. We need to have a
little conversation,

04:08.766 --> 04:11.589
- work-related. Yeah. Come on.
- All right.

04:11.709 --> 04:15.657
Shawn! I puked in the
sock drawer again!

04:16.333 --> 04:18.308
I'll get it.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.576
Thanks.

04:19.644 --> 04:20.944
Ahh.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.012
- What's up, Tom?
- What's up? You two, OK?

04:23.132 --> 04:26.016
No more nudity in the... in the house.

04:26.084 --> 04:27.107
- What?
- What?

04:27.227 --> 04:30.354
Ok. I don't want Katy seeing
your stuff, your, you know,

04:30.421 --> 04:32.155
pecs and your... whatever the
hell she was pointing at on you

04:32.223 --> 04:34.258
- and...
- Triceps.

04:34.325 --> 04:38.561
Ok. Whatever. And I'll tell you someth...
and shirts on. No nipples, all right?

04:38.681 --> 04:40.531
I don't want her looking at your nipples.

04:40.598 --> 04:42.283
- What's wrong with my nipples?
- Not just your nipples.

04:42.403 --> 04:44.034
His ni... nipple-free zone

04:44.102 --> 04:45.068
in the house now, OK?

04:45.136 --> 04:47.237
Come on, Tom. You know kids nowadays.

04:47.357 --> 04:49.723
I mean, didn't they catch
some girls have a blow job contest

04:49.843 --> 04:51.211
at her school last week?

04:52.072 --> 04:55.479
What?
They... they...  what?

04:55.547 --> 04:57.347
Who's having a blow job contest?

04:57.415 --> 04:59.082
I di...  What, in her grade?

04:59.150 --> 05:03.020
Ahem. Well, you see, I wasn't
th... we weren't there, so

05:03.087 --> 05:07.534
can't give you details blow by...
Blow. Uh, so, you know...

05:07.654 --> 05:08.659
Blow by blow?

05:08.726 --> 05:11.675
I'm gonna go inside, check on Colleen,

05:11.795 --> 05:13.630
because that tummy ache is intense.

05:13.698 --> 05:15.532
Why don't you go back inside
and do something about your

05:15.600 --> 05:17.888
girlfriend's cute, little
drinking problem, OK?

05:18.008 --> 05:19.469
Let me worry about the blow jobs.

05:19.537 --> 05:21.738
What do you want me to do,
send her to the past and have

05:21.806 --> 05:23.740
her return Amish instead of Irish?

05:23.808 --> 05:26.831
Ha ha ha! That's a good... uh...

05:27.963 --> 05:29.930
Bye-bye. Ahem.

05:30.882 --> 05:34.217
- Cocky, little...
- It's all right, Tom.

05:34.285 --> 05:35.959
You're jealous. It's human.

05:37.088 --> 05:40.744
Whoa. I'm jealous?

05:41.905 --> 05:44.697
Ok. And exactly who would I be jealous of?

05:44.817 --> 05:48.486
Well, me duh! As regards wifey in there.

05:50.916 --> 05:53.715
Let me just explain something
to you about jealousy and me, OK?

05:54.490 --> 05:59.727
I'm, you know... I'm not...
I'm, uh... I'm jealous.

05:59.847 --> 06:01.621
I'm a little jealous. I mean, the cooking thing.

06:01.636 --> 06:03.416
Where did the cooking thing come from?
I didn't know you could cook.

06:03.536 --> 06:06.817
Tom, you realize that's ridiculous, right?
We're brothers, bro.

06:06.884 --> 06:10.052
Ok. Can I just point out that
my actual brother,

06:10.172 --> 06:13.190
my real brother had an affair with my
wife, and I actually believe

06:13.257 --> 06:16.026
there might have been some
cooking involved in that, so...

06:16.094 --> 06:17.357
Yeah. Well, shit, I forgot, OK?

06:17.477 --> 06:20.414
See, it sets off an alarm for me.
I have...

06:21.545 --> 06:25.535
Shit, man. I guess I just have
some really... some trust issues

06:25.603 --> 06:27.404
and some feelings I didn't realize I--

06:27.472 --> 06:29.006
You got a great family, Tom.

06:29.073 --> 06:32.242
I mean, Tommy, look.
I got to tell you, bro, these kids,

06:32.310 --> 06:35.512
they need a dad because I'll tell you
what, looking at you laying

06:35.580 --> 06:38.822
on that barroom floor, bleeding
out, two bullets in you,

06:38.942 --> 06:41.523
got me thinking.
I hope it did the same for you.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.117
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.536
Yeah? Well, come on, asshole.
Do something about it then.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.284
I mean, right now, you know, today.
Go in there.

06:49.404 --> 06:53.071
Tell Janet how you feel.
Tell Colleen, tell Katy.

06:53.191 --> 06:55.045
I mean, shit. You better tell Katy
something.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.750
They're having blow job
contests at her school, Tom.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.659
That's one contest you sure as hell
don't want her winning or losing.

07:04.976 --> 07:08.378
You're probably right.
I never do... I never tell them,

07:08.446 --> 07:13.050
you know, how I feel.
Today's the day, right?

07:13.117 --> 07:16.721
Today. Absolutely, man.
It's the only guarantee we got.

07:17.536 --> 07:21.237
My man, you were almost dead, but
today, you ain't.

07:21.962 --> 07:25.052
I don't got to tell you, the job we do, we
could both be dead tomorrow, so...

07:28.653 --> 07:32.169
I'm gonna go in there, and
I'm gonna tell them. I'm gonna

07:32.236 --> 07:34.604
tell them exactly how
I feel about them.

07:34.672 --> 07:39.342
Good man. Yeah. I'm gonna go see
if I can get laid before work.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.112

08:33.450 --> 08:35.866
So I thought it might be a
good time to have... since

08:35.986 --> 08:39.697
it's been a while since all of us were,

08:40.533 --> 08:46.662
you know, sitting down at the same time...
to get a few things out in the open that

08:46.730 --> 08:48.531
maybe, uh...

08:55.024 --> 08:59.655
You know. So I know that I probably...

09:00.589 --> 09:09.518
well, m-most likely pretty much haven't
been the world's greatest dad for a

09:09.586 --> 09:14.023
while, so, you know, I just
wanted to say that what's

09:14.091 --> 09:18.327
happened has, um... you know, I
feel like it's changed me, and

09:18.395 --> 09:23.666
I think it's reprioritized my priorities.
So I just want you

09:23.734 --> 09:31.207
guys to know that, you know,
I... that I love you all a lot,

09:31.275 --> 09:35.344
a lot a lot.

09:35.412 --> 09:37.446
Is that it?

09:37.514 --> 09:41.083
Uh, well, that's the... that's the
gist of it, yeah, but, I mean...

09:41.151 --> 09:43.920
Hey. Can I go now?
I'm late for work.

09:43.987 --> 09:46.022
I love you, too, daddy.

09:46.089 --> 09:51.427
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

Anybody else?

09:57.534 --> 10:00.169
Blaah!

10:00.237 --> 10:01.203
Eww!

10:01.271 --> 10:07.910
Oh, my God. Ok.
Let's get you into the bathroom.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.011
Tommy, could you do me a favor?

10:09.079 --> 10:11.447
- Yeah, honey. I'll clean this up no.
- Could you actually pick

10:11.515 --> 10:13.282
up the stuff on my shopping list?
I have to take her to

10:13.350 --> 10:17.119
practice after I deal with Colleen.
I would really

10:17.187 --> 10:18.120
appreciate it.

10:18.188 --> 10:18.788
Ok.

10:18.855 --> 10:19.622
Thanks.

10:19.690 --> 10:22.858
All right. Love you.

10:22.926 --> 10:26.095
What?

10:26.163 --> 10:33.569
Uh, I said, "love you."

10:33.637 --> 10:41.210
Right.
Just don't forget that list.

Hey. Is there a, uh... at school
a, uh... is there a thing?

11:01.798 --> 11:02.565
A contest?

11:02.632 --> 11:03.599
Yes.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.701
Yeah. Mom already
talked to me about it.

11:05.769 --> 11:07.136
Oh.

11:07.204 --> 11:09.538
Yep.

11:09.606 --> 11:12.541
Cool. All right. Bye.

11:12.609 --> 11:15.678
She thinks I can win.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.580
Ahem. Sorry?

11:17.647 --> 11:19.615
I don't want to win, though.

11:19.683 --> 11:22.651
I just want to be in it because
it will be fun. Besides,

The dancing thing. Yes.

talking about the other

11:40.771 --> 11:41.704
contest, did you?

11:41.772 --> 11:44.805
- No. What...
- Eww, dad!

11:44.806 --> 11:46.906
- Hey, what's going on in there?
- Nothing, nothing.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.036
Eww.

11:49.805 --> 11:50.915
Bye.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.448
Ohh!

11:52.516 --> 11:53.149
Yeah?

11:53.216 --> 11:55.851
Hey.
You gonna talk to him today?

11:55.919 --> 11:57.453
Yep.

11:57.521 --> 11:59.255
You gonna tell him to get out?

11:59.322 --> 12:00.456
Yep.

12:00.524 --> 12:01.357
How?

12:01.425 --> 12:03.092
I'm simply gonna sit him down,
and I'm gonna explain to

12:03.160 --> 12:07.263
him how, you know, precious
every single day on this planet

12:07.330 --> 12:11.067
is the moment that we wake up
and that he should be living

12:11.134 --> 12:14.870
his dream, not living what he
thinks somebody else wants him

12:14.938 --> 12:17.606
to be or do, you know,
especially not what he thinks I

12:17.674 --> 12:22.912
want or his father would have wanted.
Hello?

12:22.979 --> 12:26.115
I'm sorry.
Who am I speaking with again?

12:28.031 --> 12:30.247
Hang on, I gotta go.
I got another call.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.374
Yeah, you gotta go, you better go
and find the real Tommy Gavin.

12:33.494 --> 12:34.884
Ah, so funny.

12:35.394 --> 12:36.514
Yeah?

12:36.693 --> 12:39.295
Yeah. I hear my messages correct,
you want to go to a meeting?

12:39.363 --> 12:42.632
Listen. This is my new thing.
Today's the day, all

12:42.699 --> 12:46.335
right? I'm, you know... I'm
living in the moment. I'm

12:46.403 --> 12:48.771
making some positive changes, all right?
That's my whole new

12:48.839 --> 12:52.909
approach, so meet me at the firehouse
at, like, 6:30, all right?

12:52.976 --> 12:55.745
All right, but just in
case, I'm bringing Teddy.

12:55.812 --> 12:57.480
All rightie.

12:57.547 --> 12:59.548
Yeah, and plenty of goddamn bullets.

12:59.616 --> 13:02.852
Ha.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.923
Here it is, boys, our secret weapon.
This is like a culinary

13:06.990 --> 13:10.526
smart bomb. Once the folks
in the community taste these

13:10.594 --> 13:13.029
brownies, they are bound
to fall in love with us.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.330
You're a genius, Lou.

13:14.398 --> 13:16.866
Quickest way to a man's heart's
through his stomach unless of

13:16.934 --> 13:20.403
course you're Franco.
Then you go right in through the dick.

13:20.470 --> 13:21.704
I heard that.

13:21.772 --> 13:22.538
It's true.

13:22.606 --> 13:24.507
Now where is my secret ingredient?

13:24.574 --> 13:25.408
I smoked it.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.143
Oh, weed joke. Very funny.

13:27.210 --> 13:29.011
Why don't you wait for Chong
to get here and do the whole

13:29.079 --> 13:29.779
routine?

13:29.846 --> 13:31.447
You know what? I smoked pot
one time, but it only made me

13:31.515 --> 13:33.516
hungry and horny, which are my
two main things anyway, so why

13:33.583 --> 13:36.352
would I want to be
hungrier or hornier?

13:36.420 --> 13:39.488
And what about stupid?

13:39.556 --> 13:40.423
Mike.

13:40.490 --> 13:41.223
What?

13:41.291 --> 13:42.858
Franco would like to
know if you smoke weed?

13:42.926 --> 13:43.693
You mean, pot?

13:43.760 --> 13:44.627
"You mean, pot?"

13:44.695 --> 13:47.296
You know, after I retire... if I
don't burn up in a fire...

13:47.364 --> 13:49.098
I'm thinking about opening up a restaurant.
I'm gonna call it

13:49.166 --> 13:53.836
Chaz Lou, like the French Chaz
Lou, but instead of c-h-a-z,

13:53.904 --> 13:57.406
I was gonna use my own spelling,
you know, of Chaz, s-h-e-a, so

13:57.474 --> 14:00.982
it would be Shea Lou.
You get it?

14:02.292 --> 14:04.412
Pack the place with Met fans. Classy.

14:04.422 --> 14:05.942
Everybody's a comedian.

14:06.049 --> 14:09.919
Aah! Christ!

14:09.987 --> 14:12.221
I'm OK.

14:12.289 --> 14:15.524
Lou, I'm gonna tell you
something, but I want you to

14:15.592 --> 14:20.129
remember that I love you, OK?

14:20.197 --> 14:21.630
You're fat.

14:21.698 --> 14:23.733
That is an old step ladder.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.767
It's brand-new.

14:24.835 --> 14:26.369
It's made in China.

14:26.436 --> 14:27.236
It's made of aluminum.

14:27.304 --> 14:28.404
Chinese aluminum.

14:28.472 --> 14:32.441
Which you broke reaching for
your private stash of fudge.

14:32.509 --> 14:35.011
French fudge.

14:35.078 --> 14:35.978
Is this French fudge?

14:36.046 --> 14:38.214
Hey! That fudge was not for
my personal consumption.

14:38.281 --> 14:40.883
That was for the common good of this house.
Once those people out

14:40.951 --> 14:42.985
there taste those brownies, let
me tell you something, the

14:43.053 --> 14:45.521
department tries to shut down
this house, there will be riots

14:45.589 --> 14:46.455
in the street!

14:46.523 --> 14:49.425
Or just a lot of really fat people
stuck in burning buildings.

14:49.493 --> 14:50.493
Hey, guys.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.360
Tom, what's up?

14:51.428 --> 14:54.530
Hey. I got a... Hey.
That ladder's broken.

14:54.598 --> 14:55.898
Yeah. Yeah, we got it.

14:55.966 --> 15:01.302
I have an announcement that I want to make.
I am quitting drinking.

15:05.042 --> 15:09.245
Guys, I'm... Hey. Listen.
I almost, you know, got,

15:09.312 --> 15:13.616
assassinated, and it's making
me, you know... I'm making some

15:13.683 --> 15:17.019
changes. I'm gonna try to be more patient.
I'm gonna...

15:17.087 --> 15:20.456
you know, I'm not gonna have a
knee-jerk, angry reaction every

15:20.524 --> 15:24.260
time something happens, and like
I said, no booze, and really, I

15:24.327 --> 15:27.630
just wanted to say it out
loud as part of my new thing.

15:27.697 --> 15:30.332
I'm... really, I don't know how
I'll be able to express my

15:30.400 --> 15:33.169
gratitude to you guys because I
wouldn't be standing here right

15:33.236 --> 15:37.239
now if it weren't for
you guys, you know?

15:42.179 --> 15:45.414
You hear this bullshit?
Stop it, Tommy.

15:45.482 --> 15:48.117
Hey. I need to talk to
you in the locker room.

15:48.185 --> 15:48.984
We were all laughing.

15:49.052 --> 15:51.554
No, no, no. It's not about now.
This part of my new I'm

15:51.621 --> 15:55.391
making amends stimulus package that I'm doing.
I gonna talk to

15:55.459 --> 15:58.194
you, and then I'm gonna talk
to Damien and then to Lou, all right?

15:59.029 --> 16:00.563
Whoa, whoa, wait.
So what about me?

16:00.630 --> 16:01.730
What? What about you?

16:01.798 --> 16:04.900
Well, you've been mean to me
for, like, the last 10 years,

16:04.968 --> 16:07.670
so...Pfft!

16:07.737 --> 16:11.941
You're right. I sincerely apologize.
I have... I have

16:12.008 --> 16:15.544
undervalued you, I have made fun
of you, and I'm sorry, and I

16:15.612 --> 16:20.086
will do my best in the future
to make certain that doesn't happen again.

16:20.096 --> 16:23.616
You're a terrific guy and I think
you're a terrific firefighter.

16:23.653 --> 16:26.989
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
Come on.

16:36.733 --> 16:39.902
You OK, brother?

16:39.970 --> 16:41.704
I don't know.

16:52.682 --> 16:53.516
What's up, Tommy?

16:53.583 --> 16:56.552
Hey. So how you doing with Colleen?
How's things going?

16:56.620 --> 17:00.956
Ok. I mean, it's a little
hard for us to, you know, get

17:01.024 --> 17:03.959
some action going on with the
kids and Janet always around,

17:04.027 --> 17:09.798
but we pick our spots.
You're not talking about... you mean,

17:09.866 --> 17:14.537
the... the drinking. Mmm.
Well, the drinking... you know,

17:14.604 --> 17:22.310
the drinking is... is...  she's... she... pbbb.

17:22.378 --> 17:27.116
It's bad. She... it's bad, Tommy.
I mean, I guess the way she took

17:27.184 --> 17:32.588
it after I told her about how
you, you know... called her

17:32.656 --> 17:35.858
straight from the hospital, and
the next day, man, she just

17:35.926 --> 17:37.560
started hitting it hard.

17:37.627 --> 17:39.762
All right. I'm gonna handle this.
Don't worry about it, OK?

17:39.829 --> 17:43.032
I got it. Um, how you doing?

17:43.099 --> 17:43.933
I'm all right.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.134
I mean drinking-wise.

17:45.202 --> 17:48.571
You know me. I have my one
or two pussy-ass drinks, and

17:48.638 --> 17:51.207
I'm good, son.

17:51.274 --> 17:52.575
All right.

18:03.186 --> 18:05.454
I see you tasted Lou's brownies.

18:05.522 --> 18:10.092
Delicious and free, 2
of my 3 favorite words.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.360
What's the third one?

18:11.428 --> 18:14.797
Chutzpa, which you must have
a hell of a lot of to come

18:14.864 --> 18:16.599
marching in here.

18:16.666 --> 18:20.469
Really? See, I thought chutzpa,
or where I come from

18:20.537 --> 18:23.872
shit for brains, is hitching our
bets for this house staying

18:23.940 --> 18:26.475
open on a goddamn barbeque
rather than going down to H.Q.

18:26.543 --> 18:27.676
And making our case.

18:27.744 --> 18:29.845
Not a good idea.
We go down there and plead our case,

18:29.913 --> 18:30.923
we're gonna look desperate.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.888
You're afraid to go down there.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.218
That's it, isn't it?

18:36.228 --> 18:39.348
See, you don't wanna roughle any feathers
just in case we do get shot down.

18:39.556 --> 18:42.925
While we're discussing shit for
brains, what about a chief

18:42.993 --> 18:48.297
sitting in a bar, drinking while
one of his guys gets shot?

18:48.365 --> 18:50.799
All right. Fine. Screw H.Q.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.669
Put our numbers up against West Side.
Our saves, our response

18:53.737 --> 18:58.274
times, we're clearly the better house.

18:58.341 --> 19:02.778
What about shootings?
What do I do when that comes up?

19:02.846 --> 19:04.980
Huh? What do we say then, huh?

19:05.048 --> 19:08.784
"We only shoot guys
in our own crew."

19:14.724 --> 19:16.025
Hey.

19:16.092 --> 19:17.960
Hey.

19:18.028 --> 19:22.333
- Um, you got... you got a little...
- What?

19:24.401 --> 19:27.703
I got toothpaste on my lip again?

19:27.771 --> 19:28.604
I get it?

19:28.672 --> 19:33.942
No. A little... let's see. Got it.
Hey. Can I talk to you for

19:34.010 --> 19:34.910
a sec?

19:34.978 --> 19:36.145
Yeah.

19:36.212 --> 19:41.350
Um, so, uh, how you doing?

19:41.418 --> 19:47.256
Uh, I mean, you know, I
haven't... I haven't really...

19:47.324 --> 19:49.892
I haven't gotten a chance to make
an actual save on my own yet,

19:49.959 --> 19:55.097
but, uh, I've been in there, in the shit.
I mean, I'm sure it's

19:55.165 --> 19:58.934
not as scary as getting shot,
but it's still pretty scary.

19:59.002 --> 20:01.070
I'm joking. Come on.

20:01.137 --> 20:08.344
Well, I just wanted to, you
know, say could be any day now,

20:08.411 --> 20:12.614
could be today. If you got into
the real shit, you're gonna

20:12.682 --> 20:15.851
find out what you're
really made of, you know.

20:15.919 --> 20:19.988
I know.

20:20.056 --> 20:23.258
Ok. No, you don't know.
I know you think that you know,

20:23.326 --> 20:25.461
but you don't. I mean, what
if you get stuck in the shit

20:25.528 --> 20:27.629
today, all right, this afternoon?
You got fire up your

20:27.697 --> 20:29.965
ass and smoke in your eyes and
your ears, you don't know what

20:30.033 --> 20:33.035
the hell's going on, and you
come to find out, you know,

20:33.103 --> 20:35.404
that you're a coward?

20:37.173 --> 20:39.908
I'm not a coward.

20:39.976 --> 20:44.576
Ok. Just... just shut up.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.825
Don't give me that attitude, okay?

20:52.835 --> 20:56.955
Every single fireman you know,
me, Lou, your father,

20:56.993 --> 21:01.029
your uncle Teddy, OK, we've all done
the same thing. We've all been

21:01.097 --> 21:03.098
in that situation, and we
passed the test, some with

21:03.166 --> 21:07.603
flying colors. You father's in
the firefighter hall of fame.

21:07.670 --> 21:11.940
If it is today or tomorrow, you
get into the real shit and you

21:12.008 --> 21:18.247
find out that you are, you
know, a coward...  you know...

21:18.314 --> 21:21.483
Shut up and listen to me.

21:21.551 --> 21:26.054
There's no shame in that, see
what I'm saying? No shame,

21:26.122 --> 21:27.990
no blame.

21:28.057 --> 21:31.493
All right. Yeah. You know what?
I mean, I have been a

21:31.561 --> 21:37.399
little scared sometimes, just,
I don't know, like, shaky.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.934
There's no shame in that.

21:39.002 --> 21:40.803
You should feel that way.
There would be something wrong if you

21:40.870 --> 21:44.706
didn't feel that way.
Just saying if it comes to the other

21:44.774 --> 21:48.277
thing, it's... that will be OK.

21:48.344 --> 21:51.313
It will be fine.

21:51.381 --> 21:52.114
All right.

21:52.182 --> 21:52.915
Come here.

21:52.982 --> 21:53.649
What?

21:53.716 --> 21:58.120
Come here. Listen.
Your father and I are very proud of

21:58.188 --> 22:03.091
you no matter what, OK?
We're proud of the man that you've

22:03.159 --> 22:06.829
become, all right? We love you.

22:06.896 --> 22:10.365
Just, uh, remember that.

22:10.433 --> 22:13.836
All right. Thanks.

22:13.903 --> 22:17.239
You're drunk.

22:17.307 --> 22:18.507
Do I smell drunk?

22:18.575 --> 22:20.175
You don't have to smell
drunk to be drunk.

22:20.243 --> 22:21.710
I'm not drunk.

22:21.778 --> 22:22.511
All right.

22:22.579 --> 22:23.312
I'm clear as a bell.

22:23.379 --> 22:24.012
Ok.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.647
It's the clearest I've ever been, OK?

22:25.715 --> 22:30.886
All right.

22:30.954 --> 22:32.621
It was a good talk, though.

22:32.689 --> 22:34.896
Yeah.

22:40.964 --> 22:43.098
Pills. Definitely pills.

22:47.341 --> 22:49.242
Hey. What are you doing here?

22:49.309 --> 22:51.544
I was in the area.
I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

22:51.612 --> 22:53.246
Jesus Christ! In what area?

22:53.313 --> 22:57.216
Let me guess... New York state,
huh, the western hemisphere?

22:57.284 --> 22:58.618
Come on.

22:58.686 --> 22:59.519
Did you talk to him yet?

22:59.586 --> 23:00.553
Yes, I did.

23:00.621 --> 23:01.354
And?

23:01.422 --> 23:05.992
And it's gonna... it's gonna
take a little time, you know.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.303
Wait, wait.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.733
Do you realize that every time
you walk into this firehouse unannounced

23:12.743 --> 23:15.343
You're just making him
***

23:15.353 --> 23:16.863
He's stuck in...He's working at a

23:16.870 --> 23:19.739
place where the guys he works
with can't wait to get more

23:19.807 --> 23:22.542
ammunition to bust his balls with.
It's just gonna make him

23:22.609 --> 23:25.278
more stubborn.

23:25.345 --> 23:27.613
What? Come... stop it.

23:27.681 --> 23:31.117
I have every right to drop
in and say hello to my son.

23:31.185 --> 23:35.555
Ok. Right has nothing to do with it.
Listen. We... you know,

23:35.622 --> 23:38.491
I gave him the information.
I'm his uncle, and I'm an old

23:38.559 --> 23:41.961
fireman, and I'm uncool, so
imagine how uncool it is when

23:42.029 --> 23:44.297
your mom drops by?

23:44.364 --> 23:47.300
My God. You know, no one... no
one tells you about this at all,

23:47.367 --> 23:50.536
all the worry that goes in
to when they're babies and when

23:50.604 --> 23:52.572
they're kids. It just gets worse, you know.
When they're

23:52.639 --> 23:54.207
grownup, it's still bad.

23:54.274 --> 23:55.041
I know.

23:55.109 --> 23:59.378
No, you don't know, OK, because
you've got girls.

23:59.446 --> 24:04.150
I got a boy, who's a goddamn fireman.

24:04.218 --> 24:07.820
Fix it.

24:07.888 --> 24:09.021
Thank you.

24:09.089 --> 24:13.626
You're welcome.

24:13.694 --> 24:15.228
Hey. What are you doing?

24:15.295 --> 24:19.265
Reading.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.733
Can I talk to you?

24:20.801 --> 24:23.336
Is this a "I have to stop
what I'm doing and pay

24:23.403 --> 24:26.005
attention" talk, or is it a
"I don't have to really pay

24:26.073 --> 24:29.609
attention and continue
what I'm doing" talk?

24:29.676 --> 24:32.578
Remember when I told you when
I died I didn't see anything?

24:32.646 --> 24:33.379
Yeah.

24:33.447 --> 24:35.481
I lied. I saw something.

24:35.549 --> 24:36.883
I'm all ears!

24:36.950 --> 24:40.520
Great. It's just between
you and me now, right?

24:40.587 --> 24:41.687
Absolutely. Brinks truck.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.823
Nothing in, nothing out.

24:43.891 --> 24:47.827
All right.
Promise not to judge me.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.829
I won't judge you, Tom. Come on.
For God's sakes, I'm your

24:49.897 --> 24:50.897
best friend forever and ever.

24:50.964 --> 24:51.697
You know that.

24:51.765 --> 24:53.466
That's right.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.135
Unless, you know, I meet Jeter
or something like that.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.703
Goes without saying, right?

24:57.771 --> 24:58.871
Go ahead.

24:58.939 --> 25:08.681
Ahem. I die. I see Jimmy.
I see all the guys from 9/11.

25:08.749 --> 25:11.250
They're all there.
I don't talk to everybody obviously, but

25:11.318 --> 25:14.720
they're all there, all 343 of them.
I mean, I don't see all

25:14.788 --> 25:17.356
of them individually, but, you
know, it's them. They're all

25:17.424 --> 25:24.297
around me, and we're walking
towards a bright, white light.

25:24.364 --> 25:27.105
I know, but that's what we were doing.

25:29.115 --> 25:31.235
And then we get... I get blown back.

25:32.372 --> 25:36.242
And we get separated, and I'm, like,
in a hallway like I'm at a job.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.877
It's Smokey, and it's full of fire.

25:37.945 --> 25:45.084
It's... it's bad, and I can hear
people screaming, and there's,

25:45.152 --> 25:48.754
like, apartment doors in this
hallway, so I open the doors,

25:48.822 --> 25:53.260
I see Janet, and then I...
I can't get in there, you know.

25:53.270 --> 25:56.270
And fire's chasing me and I...
So I get

25:56.328 --> 25:59.964
to this next door, and I go in
this room, and it's just full

26:00.031 --> 26:04.336
of smoke, man, and the door
closes behind me, and I see...

26:06.905 --> 26:10.877
Colleen and Katy, and they're
in turmoil.

26:10.944 --> 26:20.920
And I can't get to them, and these arms
are clawing at me. It's like... it's

26:20.988 --> 26:24.428
like zombies.

26:31.496 --> 26:35.938
So I just fight my way back here.

26:40.606 --> 26:43.774
Hey, guys. I think we might
have to get Tommy a priest.

26:43.842 --> 26:45.510
I'm pretty sure he's allergic.

26:45.577 --> 26:47.245
No, no. Seriously.
I just overheard him telling Lou about

26:47.312 --> 26:48.980
all the shit he saw when he
died, and it was some seriously

26:49.047 --> 26:51.582
messed up stuff like blazing
heat and dead relatives and

26:51.650 --> 26:53.584
zombies. It sounded like
he was going to hell.

26:53.652 --> 26:54.519
Or Florida.

26:54.586 --> 26:56.954
Tommy goes to hell, or in
other news, the sun will be

26:57.022 --> 27:00.590
setting in the west this evening,
and Barry Bonds was on steroids.

27:01.727 --> 27:04.428
No, seriously, I think he needs,
like, an exorcism or something.

27:04.496 --> 27:06.097
Can't. Pope canceled them.

27:06.164 --> 27:09.800
Canceled exorcisms, any chance
of gay marriage, and limbo.

27:09.868 --> 27:11.969
He can't cancel a dance.

27:12.037 --> 27:14.071
Uh, guys, I think Tommy's just
doing his best to try and

27:14.139 --> 27:15.172
get right with God, you know?

27:15.240 --> 27:17.541
Yeah? Well, he's pretty much
missed that get right with God boat sun.

27:18.043 --> 27:20.044
Look. If God's keeping score,
then Mikey's screwed

27:20.112 --> 27:21.312
after that whole gay thing.

27:21.380 --> 27:23.014
It was a phase, dude.

27:23.081 --> 27:27.685
Well, it was a phase full of sin, Mike.
I mean, jeez. God

27:27.753 --> 27:29.554
hates gays supposedly, right?

27:29.621 --> 27:33.758
Unless you're a priest.
Then it's OK...Father Mike.

27:33.825 --> 27:36.027
You know what? Then you're
totally screwed for the whole

27:36.094 --> 27:37.895
jerking off too much thing, dude.

27:37.963 --> 27:39.630
Eh, I think we're all screwed
for the whole jerking

27:39.698 --> 27:40.464
off too much thing.

27:40.532 --> 27:42.937
So if we stop now, there's a better chance
of us getting into Heaven.

27:42.947 --> 27:46.667
No, if you stop jerking off, all your tensions
gonna back up, you're flying on murder,

27:46.705 --> 27:48.439
rage and start killing people.

27:48.507 --> 27:51.275
Then you're right back where
you started, going to hell.

27:51.343 --> 27:54.045
Well, I for one am gonna
put myself on a strict,

27:54.112 --> 27:57.081
nonnegotiable jerk off
diet, set a quota.

27:57.149 --> 27:59.050
What are you thinking,
like, cut back once a day?

27:59.117 --> 28:01.485
No, no. It's got to be more
drastic than that. I'm thinking

28:01.553 --> 28:02.320
every other day.

28:02.387 --> 28:03.287
Every 48 hours.

28:03.355 --> 28:05.556
No. Every other day is good.

28:05.624 --> 28:08.392
Thanks, though. What are we
talking about here really? It's

28:08.460 --> 28:10.828
like my soul, right?
I mean, I got to make it right with God.

28:10.896 --> 28:13.264
Hey. You know what we should
do, seriously? Other good

28:13.332 --> 28:16.200
things. All of us, really.

28:16.268 --> 28:17.902
Yeah. Isn't that pretty
much our job, asshole?

28:17.970 --> 28:19.737
I mean, when we're outside
of the firehouse, you know,

28:19.805 --> 28:22.607
when we're off the clock.
If we die and there is a whole

28:22.674 --> 28:24.675
afterworld thing, don't we want
to know that we've got our

28:24.743 --> 28:26.744
asses covered? Come to think
of it, in terms of the whole

28:26.812 --> 28:28.846
jerking off thing, once every
36 hours, I think, is good,

28:28.914 --> 28:31.248
right? I mean, the good deeds,
that will buy us at least 12

28:31.316 --> 28:33.618
hours, right? You know what I'm
thinking about doing? Working

28:33.685 --> 28:34.585
with the blind.

28:34.653 --> 28:36.821
The blind know how to jerk off.
How do you think they got

28:36.888 --> 28:40.491
that way? But I like your focus.

28:40.559 --> 28:42.526
You're right. Once every 24 hours.
That's about as much as

28:42.594 --> 28:44.829
I can cut back and still, you
know, incorporate the whole

28:44.896 --> 28:48.165
living focused and tempering
your impulses thing.

28:48.233 --> 28:49.333
So you're back to once a day.

28:49.401 --> 28:51.002
Yeah.
Well, who's counting really?

28:51.069 --> 28:53.671
What are you guys talking about?

28:53.739 --> 28:54.472
Um, Mets.

28:54.539 --> 28:55.806
"American Idol."

28:55.874 --> 28:57.441
Jerking off.

29:02.614 --> 29:04.482
Heh. "American Idol."

29:13.364 --> 29:15.899
Well, look at that.
Call comes in smack dab between us

29:15.967 --> 29:18.601
and West Side's wild men, and
look who's first on the scene.

29:18.669 --> 29:19.536
All right. Look, fellas.

29:19.603 --> 29:21.604
This structure's unstable, so
keep your hats on in there.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.173
There's a kid trapped down there.

29:23.240 --> 29:23.840
Down where?

29:23.908 --> 29:25.275
The basement on the side there.

29:25.343 --> 29:26.076
Show us.

29:26.143 --> 29:26.810
Frankie, go get a rope.

29:26.877 --> 29:28.144
Yeah.

29:28.212 --> 29:29.746
Oh, no, no, no, big fella.

29:29.814 --> 29:33.583
You're on the bleachers for this one.
Well, look who

29:33.651 --> 29:35.452
decided to show up.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.328
Sean-o, keep your eyes on that wall.
You see any movement

29:45.396 --> 29:46.363
at all, you scream.

29:46.430 --> 29:47.464
You got it, Lou.

29:47.531 --> 29:48.231
Hey.

29:48.299 --> 29:49.899
Jesus Christ.
Where did you come from?

29:49.967 --> 29:51.201
What do you think? What's up?

29:51.268 --> 29:52.569
He's going in.

29:52.636 --> 29:53.603
The hell he is.

29:53.671 --> 29:54.637
Please don't use that word.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.306
Oh, it looks kind of dangerous,
but I think it will

29:56.374 --> 29:58.141
be all right, right?

29:58.209 --> 30:00.944
Look. There's no access to the
basement from the interior,

30:01.012 --> 30:03.213
and he's the only one of us got
a chance of squeezing through.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.080
All right. I'm going in.

30:04.148 --> 30:06.649
No, no, no, don't go.
I don't think he should go. I really don't.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.284
Look. There is a child trapped
under there, all right?

30:08.352 --> 30:09.486
He's going. This is your job.

30:09.553 --> 30:11.421
This is what you've been trained for.
Now go.

30:11.489 --> 30:12.455
Just be careful, OK?

30:12.523 --> 30:14.958
Come on. Come on.

30:15.026 --> 30:15.825
Shit!

30:15.893 --> 30:16.926
It's all right. Go ahead.

30:16.994 --> 30:17.694
It's all right. Come on.

30:17.762 --> 30:18.661
Let's go. You got it. Let's go.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.997
Take it easy and slow.

30:21.065 --> 30:22.966
Come on. Get low.
Get in there.

30:23.034 --> 30:23.767
Watch yourself, bud.

30:23.834 --> 30:25.402
That's it. That's it.

30:25.469 --> 30:26.936
Give him me some slack, Mike.
Give me some slack.

30:27.004 --> 30:28.571
Yep, yep, yep.

30:28.639 --> 30:33.143
Go easy.

30:33.210 --> 30:34.144
Hey, guys. Heads-up.

30:34.211 --> 30:35.011
What?

30:35.079 --> 30:37.580
Sorry. No. I mean, look at
that thing over there. It's

30:37.648 --> 30:41.651
like a giant, green tit.
Heh heh heh.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.521
Will you just watch the goddamn wall?

30:45.423 --> 30:46.656
Dami.

30:46.724 --> 30:49.159
Dame-o, what's going on back there?

30:49.226 --> 30:51.161
You OK?

30:51.228 --> 30:52.495
Damien!

30:52.563 --> 30:55.298
Dame!

30:55.366 --> 30:56.666
Got him!

30:56.734 --> 30:57.834
Can you move him?

30:57.902 --> 30:59.769
He's conscious.
I'm gonna push him out.

30:59.837 --> 31:02.105
Good. All right.
Pull him out.

31:02.173 --> 31:02.906
Come on, come on.

31:02.973 --> 31:03.740
All right. Take it easy!

31:03.808 --> 31:04.541
Oh, shit. Hey, guys.

31:04.608 --> 31:05.742
Yeah, yeah. We know, the tit.

31:05.752 --> 31:07.552
- No, no, there's a crack.
- An ass crack?

31:07.562 --> 31:08.582
No, a crack in the wall.

31:08.592 --> 31:10.712
- Oh, my God.
- Bring him out right now.

31:11.182 --> 31:11.981
Get out of there faster.

31:12.049 --> 31:13.716
Watch his head, Mike.
Watch his head.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.352
Come on.

31:16.420 --> 31:17.353
All right.

31:17.421 --> 31:18.188
Nice.

31:18.255 --> 31:20.623
Yeah. There you go.

31:20.691 --> 31:21.558
All right. Good.

31:21.625 --> 31:22.759
Good stuff, Dame-o.

31:22.827 --> 31:23.593
Come on, Damien.

31:23.661 --> 31:26.696
Come on, buddy. Get out of there.
Hold on. Watch this.

31:26.764 --> 31:27.964
Good job, Dame.

31:28.032 --> 31:28.765
Yeah, bro.

31:28.833 --> 31:29.599
All right, pal.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.134
Good work, man.
You all right?

31:31.202 --> 31:31.935
Let's go, let's go.

31:32.002 --> 31:32.735
Good job. You OK?

31:32.803 --> 31:33.603
I could use a drink.

31:33.671 --> 31:36.873
Well, that we can oblige.

31:36.941 --> 31:38.141
Good stuff, probie.

31:38.209 --> 31:41.043
- You see, Tommy? I told you he'd be fine.
- You're worse than his mother.

31:41.245 --> 31:42.579
Yeah. Well...

31:46.750 --> 31:49.686
You got to be shitting me.

31:52.189 --> 31:52.989
Hey, dad.

31:53.057 --> 31:55.692
Hi.

31:55.759 --> 31:57.227
What's going on?

31:57.294 --> 32:01.397
Wyatt's asleep, and mom's listening
to her iPod on the deck.

32:01.465 --> 32:03.099
Mom bought an iPod?

32:03.167 --> 32:07.170
Uncle Franco bought it for her.

32:15.246 --> 32:16.312
Oh, my God!

32:16.380 --> 32:17.147
Jesus Christ.

32:17.214 --> 32:19.249
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me!

32:19.316 --> 32:22.685
- I just was...
- You OK down there?

32:22.753 --> 32:23.953
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:24.021 --> 32:25.021
I'm her husband.

32:25.089 --> 32:27.726
So what? Shut up!

32:28.336 --> 32:29.736
Unbelievable.

32:29.793 --> 32:30.627
Oh.

32:30.694 --> 32:33.429
I didn't know you had the thing.

32:33.497 --> 32:35.198
Tommy, you can't... you can't
sneak up from behind and hug

32:35.266 --> 32:37.867
somebody like that. At night?

32:37.935 --> 32:39.335
Jesus.

32:39.403 --> 32:41.375
Sorry.

32:45.442 --> 32:48.211
What?

32:48.279 --> 32:54.450
Nothing. Just I wanted to tell
you that I got the groceries.

32:54.518 --> 32:56.819
Oh, that is not your "I got
the groceries" face. That is

32:56.887 --> 33:02.525
your "I've got something to say" face.

33:02.593 --> 33:03.726
Spit it out.

33:03.794 --> 33:05.228
What?

33:09.667 --> 33:10.767
What? I... what?

33:10.834 --> 33:14.270
Oh, my God.
You have feelings.

33:14.338 --> 33:15.205
Ok.

33:15.272 --> 33:19.943
Oh. No, no, wait. You've changed.
No, no. Your greatest hit.

33:21.510 --> 33:23.020
You're stopping drinking...

33:23.030 --> 33:25.130
- Nah..
- For real this time.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.460
It was the second one.

33:31.188 --> 33:36.459
Listen. Obviously, what
happened, you know, you have

33:36.527 --> 33:41.998
to... you know, it's one of those
things, and I know PE... you

33:42.066 --> 33:46.636
know, it's... I just wanted to
make it clear to you that my

33:46.704 --> 33:52.909
feelings for you are... I think
that they're stronger than

33:52.977 --> 33:59.215
they've ever been, and I just
wanted to express that to you.

33:59.283 --> 34:05.722
So everything's gonna be
different as of right now?

34:05.789 --> 34:08.824
Yeah. Well, it is different.

34:08.891 --> 34:10.659
Hey. People can change, honey.

34:10.728 --> 34:17.333
Yeah, Tommy, I know.
I sure as hell did. You know,

34:17.400 --> 34:23.572
I used to to have fun instead of griping,
but now everything that I do is

34:23.641 --> 34:31.214
coated in anger and cynicism and ash.
I hate what you've

34:31.282 --> 34:40.223
made me. Look. We're here 10 years later.
So who gives a

34:40.291 --> 34:44.027
shit about any of it? I don't.

34:44.094 --> 34:46.963
You know, the only change that
I'm interested in involves the

34:47.031 --> 34:51.067
kids. You know, I want Katy to
have as normal a next few years

34:51.135 --> 34:54.536
as she can have before college.

34:54.605 --> 34:57.573
Wyatt doesn't know the
difference yet, but if it's

34:57.641 --> 35:01.811
good for her, then it's gonna
be fine for him, and as for

35:01.879 --> 35:07.050
today, you really want to make a difference?
Then you go talk

35:07.117 --> 35:11.521
to Colleen.
She gets off work in an hour.

35:11.588 --> 35:13.056
Ok.

35:13.123 --> 35:16.859
Ok.

35:23.567 --> 35:26.803
I am so not ready to hug yet.

35:39.144 --> 35:41.213
Is it impossible for us to
walk and talk like

35:41.281 --> 35:44.296
two adult people having...

35:48.006 --> 35:50.106
I think you're drinking too much.

35:53.116 --> 35:54.916
And I'm not the only one who thinks that.

35:58.764 --> 36:00.334
And I think you're drinking
for all the wrong reasons.

36:00.344 --> 36:01.164
That's what I think.

36:03.002 --> 36:08.206
Jesus Christ. I'm trying to
explain something to you here.

36:08.274 --> 36:09.908
Let's get a drink.

36:09.975 --> 36:11.709
We're not getting a drink.

36:11.777 --> 36:14.312
That's what you'd do if I were a boy.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.714
You'd give me a severe talking to,
and then you'd throw your arm around my

36:16.782 --> 36:20.685
neck and say, "let's get a drink, kid."

36:20.753 --> 36:22.887
That's what you'd do if it were Connor
standing here instead of me.

36:22.897 --> 36:25.617
I bet that's exactly what you'd do.

36:27.355 --> 36:29.558
I bet it's what grandpa did with you too.

36:35.401 --> 36:39.404
Ohh.

36:39.472 --> 36:42.974
Jesus! She's knocking them back
like a Kennedy over there.

36:43.042 --> 36:46.244
As long as she doesn't
drive like one, we're OK.

36:46.312 --> 36:48.580
Hey, sexy. Give me another.

36:48.647 --> 36:50.782
I'm learning a valuable lesson.

36:50.850 --> 36:52.584
See, this is what I don't understand.
This what my old

36:52.651 --> 36:55.920
man did to me, made me drink
and smoke until, you know,

36:55.988 --> 36:56.888
I felt like quitting.

36:56.956 --> 36:59.657
And now you're finally
thinking of actually really

36:59.725 --> 37:03.127
giving up drinking, what, 3 decades later?
Ok. Cool. Nice.

37:03.195 --> 37:06.598
So in 30 years from now, I'll
get the old Colleen back.

37:06.665 --> 37:08.466
Can't wait. How many has she had, man?

37:08.534 --> 37:11.102
Well, I'm sure Eddie's keeping
exact... I think I bought

37:11.170 --> 37:13.605
her, like, 4 double vodkas to start.

37:13.672 --> 37:15.707
That's Keith Richards territory.
How about you just

37:15.774 --> 37:17.208
order a body bag, Tommy?

37:17.276 --> 37:19.677
Listen. You know, how many
drinks does it normally take her

37:19.745 --> 37:20.979
to go from happy to angry?

37:21.046 --> 37:22.580
6.

37:22.648 --> 37:24.115
Ok.

37:24.183 --> 37:27.252
Hey! What are you
looking at, bitch?

37:27.319 --> 37:28.753
6 it is.

37:40.699 --> 37:42.367
Ahem.

37:42.434 --> 37:43.268
Hey, cuz.

37:43.335 --> 37:44.202
Hey.

37:44.270 --> 37:46.271
You know, I get what you're
trying to do here, the tough

37:46.338 --> 37:48.873
love. It's old school, it's admirable.
I'd probably do the

37:48.941 --> 37:50.608
same thing if I was in your shoes.

37:50.676 --> 37:51.509
Mm-hmm.

37:51.577 --> 37:54.879
You know, you want me to put
something in Colleen's drink,

37:54.947 --> 37:56.981
you know, something to make her,
like, sick to her stomach,

37:57.049 --> 37:59.484
make her pass out,
something like that?

37:59.552 --> 38:02.253
No, thanks. That's a great
idea, but too late for that I

38:02.321 --> 38:04.689
think, although maybe you
should make one of those for

38:04.757 --> 38:13.031
me. God. 15 bucks.
I mean, these are illicit drugs. I'm giving

38:13.098 --> 38:14.365
them to you retail.

38:14.433 --> 38:16.334
You're telling me that if I
wanted to give here the thing

38:16.402 --> 38:18.069
you were gonna charge me 15 bucks?
You are the cheapest

38:18.137 --> 38:18.736
Mick son of a bitch.

38:18.804 --> 38:20.772
Well, yeah. Do you have any idea
how much these things cost me?

38:20.839 --> 38:22.373
I'm your cousin... I'm trying to
save my daughter from becoming

38:22.441 --> 38:26.244
- a raging...
- Tommy! Yeah!

38:26.312 --> 38:28.646
Swear to God. Hey.
How you doing?

38:28.714 --> 38:33.251
You are the best uncle, Tom,
the best, and this is the best

38:33.319 --> 38:35.186
goddamn job ever.

38:35.254 --> 38:36.087
Yeah, it is.

38:36.155 --> 38:39.490
No. You were right. You were right.
I didn't know, but I

38:39.558 --> 38:40.391
know now.

38:40.459 --> 38:41.192
Yeah?

38:41.260 --> 38:43.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry about that. No, no, no!

38:43.462 --> 38:44.195
Come here.

38:44.263 --> 38:45.396
Hey. Thanks.

38:46.365 --> 38:49.167
Hey. Oh. Ah, ah, ah!
I got a phone call.

38:49.234 --> 38:50.034
Aah!

38:50.102 --> 38:51.202
Wait a minute.

38:51.270 --> 38:53.638
Stop! No!

38:53.706 --> 38:55.073
Chill out. Take it down.

38:55.140 --> 38:55.940
Yeah?

38:56.008 --> 38:58.543
Hey. Did you talk to her?

38:58.611 --> 39:00.411
Yes, I did.

39:00.479 --> 39:02.814
And?

39:02.881 --> 39:04.682
It's going good.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.484
Where are you?

39:06.552 --> 39:14.425
Um, the...
I got to call you back.

39:14.493 --> 39:16.260
Kids, hey, hey.

39:16.328 --> 39:18.730
Tommy...  enough!

39:18.797 --> 39:19.697
Let her go.

39:19.765 --> 39:20.565
You all right?

39:20.633 --> 39:21.399
My stupid dress.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.801
Ok, OK, OK. Just relax.

39:23.869 --> 39:26.404
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

39:26.672 --> 39:29.540
The guys in the firehouse
said you'd be here.

39:29.608 --> 39:31.909
What, did you forget our
little appointment?

39:37.850 --> 39:39.116
Aw, you're drunk.

39:39.184 --> 39:40.051
No.

39:40.118 --> 39:41.619
No. He hasn't had a drop.

39:41.687 --> 39:43.054
Cheap prick.

39:43.121 --> 39:47.258
You know what? Cheap prick, huh?
Here. Buy a shot for

39:47.326 --> 39:48.025
everybody in the bar.

39:48.093 --> 39:50.494
Everybody! It's one free drink
on me, all right? As a matter

39:50.562 --> 39:53.965
of fact, give me one, too.
Give me a goddamn hockey helmet full

39:54.032 --> 39:58.469
of Irish whiskey.
How's that sound?

39:58.537 --> 40:02.340
I know. I know. I know what I said.
I was gonna change. Today

40:02.407 --> 40:05.843
was the day and blah, blah,
blah, but, you know, the world

40:05.911 --> 40:10.348
is not cooperating, all right, you know?
I'm taking shit from

40:10.415 --> 40:12.283
my wife. I'm trying to make amends with her.
She's busting

40:12.351 --> 40:14.752
my balls. I'm supposed to watch
my godson, make sure he doesn't

40:14.820 --> 40:16.120
get himself killed on the job.

40:16.188 --> 40:18.456
I'm supposed to get to her quit drinking.
You can see how

40:18.523 --> 40:23.559
that's going. My other daughter
wants to win a blow job contest.

40:23.927 --> 40:27.535
She's not involved. It's not happening.
Don't worry about it.

40:27.545 --> 40:31.545
You know they had one of those when I was in school.
I came in third.

40:31.603 --> 40:32.370
See what I'm talking about?

40:32.437 --> 40:33.938
This is what I'm dealing with here.

40:34.006 --> 40:35.106
I'm just kidding.

40:35.173 --> 40:39.143
I won.

40:39.211 --> 40:41.946
Ok. I'm trying to be nice, and
I'm trying to be kind, and

40:42.014 --> 40:48.185
I'm trying to be patient, but
it's not... not my thing.

40:48.253 --> 40:53.090
I got to do this baby steps.
It's been a long, long, long-ass

40:53.158 --> 41:00.164
day, so I know that I got to quit
smoking and drinking, but...

41:00.232 --> 41:03.768
We're gonna have to just pick
one, and it looks like today is

41:03.835 --> 41:11.709
the day... that I quit smoking.
So shoot me.

41:11.777 --> 41:15.011
I didn't bring my gun. I thought
we were taking him to a meeting.

41:15.013 --> 41:18.683
Wait, wait!
I think I have a knife.

41:18.750 --> 41:24.121
Forget the knife.
We're gonna need a bazooka.

41:24.189 --> 41:26.457
Better make it a big one.
