00:01.102 --> 00:03.035
Previously on<i> Hawaii Five-O...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.704
AILANA:
I'm Ailana Read, Child Services.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.873
Yesterday morning
we finally managed

00:07.874 --> 00:10.041
to locate your niece's
aunt and uncle in Mexico.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.443
Okay. And?

00:11.445 --> 00:13.112
They have retained
a lawyer, and are

00:13.114 --> 00:14.747
taking steps
to adopt Sara.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.316
CHIN:<i> How long</i>
<i> before it's finalized?</i>

00:17.318 --> 00:19.418
AILANA:
<i> No more than a month.</i>

00:19.420 --> 00:21.553
MAHOE:<i> Are we sure these</i>
<i> murders are connected?</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:23.288
Everything's pointing towards
this being serial.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.124
So this guy murders
four people

00:25.126 --> 00:27.326
within days of each other
at the same hotel,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.495
then turns up dead?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.730
What is that?
NOELANI: I have no idea.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.465
Hey, show me your
hands! Get out!

00:33.467 --> 00:35.951
STEVE:
We got another one.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.436
Those carvings are modeled
after 11th century chess pieces.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.638
Pawns, to be exact.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.073
Maybe whoever knocked off
Hein and Larsen

00:41.075 --> 00:42.408
thinks this thing is a game.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.798
It's from the same chess set
as all the other pieces.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.500
Which tells me that
whoever compelled

01:08.502 --> 01:10.469
Anthony Lee Hein,
David Larsen,

01:10.471 --> 01:12.371
and, more than likely,
Pierre Shaw

01:12.373 --> 01:14.540
to kill on their behalf,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.175
that they're still out there.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.077
And I take it
you're here because

01:18.079 --> 01:19.445
you want my help?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.180
Yeah, I mean, you were
a behavioral analyst

01:21.182 --> 01:22.681
for the FBI for 15 years.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.216
You've profiled a lot
of serial killers.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.618
I'm also retired.
Um, hmm.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.354
That chess piece you're holding
is our only solid lead.

01:29.356 --> 01:33.125
We have allocated absolutely
every available resource

01:33.127 --> 01:34.293
to this case.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.795
It's been a week,
and, well,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.664
we, uh... we have nothing.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.365
Well, that's
not unusual

01:40.367 --> 01:42.134
in cases like this,
where the killer

01:42.136 --> 01:43.819
suddenly goes
to ground.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.503
That's when it becomes
a waiting game.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.739
Patience,
that'll be the key.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.842
Patience is definitely
not his strong suit.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.477
He left that in my house.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.711
In my house.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.213
What, is he taunting me?

01:54.215 --> 01:56.181
Help me understand, please.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.517
On the contrary.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.153
Commander, I, uh...

02:01.155 --> 02:02.888
I think that the
killer admires you.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.290
The knight is the
protector of the realm.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.159
In chess, that is a
very powerful weapon

02:07.161 --> 02:09.528
in close positions.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.497
I think he sees you
as a potentially

02:11.499 --> 02:13.699
dangerous adversary,
unlike the victims,

02:13.701 --> 02:16.401
who were mere pawns,

02:16.403 --> 02:18.270
expendable
foot soldiers.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.705
This is just my
opinion,

02:19.707 --> 02:22.407
but I think that
the chess metaphor,

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
with the people
moving around

02:24.411 --> 02:26.879
and the thing with...
I don't, uh...

02:26.881 --> 02:29.448
I don't buy it, personally.
No disrespect, Miss Brown.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.184
Maybe this guy is not
as smart as you think he is.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.319
And yet, here
you are in my home

02:34.321 --> 02:35.721
asking for help.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.924
Don't make the mistake
of underestimating

02:38.926 --> 02:40.459
this person, Detective.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.529
He doesn't just have
people killing for him,

02:43.531 --> 02:45.264
he has them sending
him pictures,

02:45.266 --> 02:46.331
evidence of his work.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.900
That is a highly
sophisticated form

02:47.902 --> 02:49.334
of manipulation.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.203
The government of Hawaii
has empowered us

02:51.205 --> 02:54.740
to do whatever
is necessary to, uh,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.375
to catch whoever's
responsible.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.210
So I need you to tell me
what it's gonna take

02:58.212 --> 02:59.344
for you to come
and work for us,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.779
temporarily, of course.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.415
I'm sorry, Commander,

03:03.417 --> 03:04.917
but I'm...
I'm retired.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.655
Do you understand that
innocent people are dead?

03:10.925 --> 03:14.760
Innocent people
with families.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.461
That's got to mean
something to you.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.765
It does.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.835
My answer's still no.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.876
Good luck.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.844
We'll let ourselves out.
Thank you.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.455
That was a waste
of time, huh?

Nothing.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.217
I want it found.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.786
Then get rid of him.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.104
What did you do with it?

CHIN:
I've got to be honest,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.827
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.095
But I don't think
this is a French braid.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.264
It's a Hawaiian braid.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.699
Yes, it is.
I guess it is.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.835
(chuckling)

08:56.837 --> 08:58.136
(grunting playfully)

08:58.138 --> 08:59.871
Hold on.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.041
What do you think?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.926
CHIN (laughs):
All right.

09:04.927 --> 09:06.810
I hope I can remember how
to do this tomorrow.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.151
Hey, you okay?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.989
Why do I have to go live
with someone else?

09:19.226 --> 09:22.060
Oh, sweetie, they're not
just someone else,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.995
they're family.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.730
You belong with them.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.266
So are you, right?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.069
You're family.

09:32.806 --> 09:36.641
I want to live with you,
Uncle Chin.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.145
Listen, listen...

09:40.147 --> 09:43.181
(sighs)
Come here, you.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.619
I'm gonna visit you
as soon as I can, okay?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.688
That's a promise.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.676
Vic's name is
Casta Mitchell.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.144
She's a 22-year-old
student.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.213
She's on the books of
a local modeling agency.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.815
Excuse me.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.882
(police radio chatter)

10:17.884 --> 10:20.685
Forced entry.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.387
KONO:
Apartment was tossed.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.088
Vic had cash and jewelry
that was left behind.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.392
Still, obviously, perp was
looking for something.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.127
Body's in here.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.164
COD was strangulation.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.741
DANNY (sighs): Well, I assume
there's no chess pieces,

10:42.743 --> 10:44.109
so that's something,
right?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.044
Looks like she was dressed
for an evening out.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.412
Kono, see if you can
find out where she went.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.880
Yeah, well,
this might help.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.215
This was found
in her purse.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.817
The symbol on it's
called the Eye of Horus.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.736
It's an Egyptian charm.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.654
It's supposed
to bring good luck.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.891
STEVE:
Yeah, only not for her.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.830
NOELANI:
<i> Your girl fought back.</i>

11:04.831 --> 11:06.798
She did this to herself trying
to remove her attacker's hands,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.833
but in addition
to her own skin tissue,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.136
I also found foreign DNA
under her fingernails.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.871
We get an I.D.?
Not initially.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.806
But after broadening
my search,

11:14.808 --> 11:17.275
I got a hit
in an unlikely place...

11:17.277 --> 11:19.177
Interpol.
Interpol?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.679
His name is
Harry Langford.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.180
And from what I gather,
he's an MI6 agent

11:22.182 --> 11:23.748
with a "kill or capture"
notice on him.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.985
Okay, so he's
a British spy running rogue.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.187
He took a huge risk
stepping out of the shadows

11:29.189 --> 11:30.722
with that kind
of heat on him.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.757
Seems like whatever
he was looking for

11:32.759 --> 11:35.160
in Casta's apartment
was pretty important.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.725
STEVE:
All right, reached out to MI6.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.059
Here's what we know
on Langford.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.761
Guy was former
British SAS.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.463
He joined the agency
in 2006,

12:11.465 --> 12:14.799
served with distinction
until a few years ago

12:14.801 --> 12:16.968
when he was caught
selling state secrets.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.038
See that? Train a guy to be all
underhanded and sneaky,

12:20.040 --> 12:21.173
and what does he do?

12:21.174 --> 12:22.307
He ends up being all
underhanded and sneaky.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.109
Well, Langford was
disavowed.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.844
He's been on the run
ever since.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.179
I ran facial rec against
the TSA database.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.415
He came into Hawaii
two days ago under an alias.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.250
There's now a statewide
APB on him.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.085
Let's hope we have better luck
than British intel.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.854
Every time they get a bead
on this guy, he vanishes.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.824
Hey, I ran Casta Mitchell's
cell phone.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.227
Check out this text
she got yesterday.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.928
GROVER:
"The Eye will get you in.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.298
Dress appropriately.
As always, discretion is key."

12:47.300 --> 12:49.801
Text traced back to a woman
named Lucy Mitsu.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.870
She runs a local agency
that books girls

12:51.872 --> 12:53.204
for high-end parties
and local events.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.406
Oh, that don't sound
shady at all.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.509
I'm guessing, uh, Casta
is one of her models.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.844
Okay, so where was
this party?

12:59.846 --> 13:02.347
It was at the private
residence of this guy.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.414
Lucky Morad.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.983
Oh, he seems fun.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.285
Egyptian-born businessman
with a net worth

13:07.287 --> 13:08.853
in the nine figures.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.455
And by all accounts,
he spends much of that money

13:10.457 --> 13:12.991
living the hard-partying life
of an international playboy.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.127
I got to get some new friends.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.262
Anyway, I ran Langford's picture
by Miss Mitsu,

13:17.264 --> 13:18.863
and she confirmed
he was at the party.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.399
She said that our guy was
involved in some dustup

13:21.401 --> 13:22.467
with Morad's security.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.535
She heard there
was a robbery,

13:23.537 --> 13:25.303
but when they
searched Langford,

13:25.305 --> 13:26.738
they came up empty.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.172
Okay, what happened
to Langford after that?

13:28.175 --> 13:30.875
Well, security took him away,
and no one saw him again.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.310
But this is where
it gets interesting.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.312
Right before they
caught up to Langford,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.014
he was talking to Casta,

13:36.016 --> 13:37.515
and the vibe was
very flirtatious.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.984
Picked a hell of a time
to push up on this girl.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.452
Well, maybe he did
steal something,

13:41.454 --> 13:42.921
<i> and he was using her</i>

13:42.923 --> 13:44.923
<i> to get whatever he stole</i>
<i> out of the party.</i>

13:44.925 --> 13:46.541
And then Langford
tracks her down later,

13:46.542 --> 13:48.158
kills her, and takes back
whatever he stole from Morad.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.862
CHIN: Well, Morad seemed to want
to keep this robbery a secret,

13:50.864 --> 13:53.565
because according to HPD,
he never filed a police report.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.433
Well, I think that
means that whatever

13:55.435 --> 13:56.901
was stolen
from Morad was

13:56.903 --> 13:58.937
either embarrassing
as hell or was illegal.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.105
Probably rule out
a sex tape.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.473
Unless, of course,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.043
this guy wanted
a reality show for himself.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.411
Think about it,
a guy like this.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.979
But then, of course, he would
have put it out himself.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.215
Just some thoughts.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.483
(cell phone rings)

14:12.485 --> 14:14.052
STEVE:
Yeah?

14:14.054 --> 14:16.888
No, no, no, let her up.
Let her up, I know her.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.958
Miss Brown, what
a nice surprise.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.460
Is it, Commander?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.961
You left this
on my coffee table.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.842
Really?
Yeah.

14:25.843 --> 14:27.421
Or, of course, it could
have been a mistake

14:27.422 --> 14:29.000
or a not-so-subtle ploy to keep
me thinking about your case.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.201
That's definitely
the sort

14:30.202 --> 14:31.401
of underhanded thing
that he would do.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.604
STEVE:
No, I...

14:32.606 --> 14:35.974
Yeah.
Well, it worked.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.375
So just to be clear,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.410
my position hasn't
changed.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.712
I'm retired.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.013
Absolutely. Yes, ma'am.
Absolutely.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.216
I did some digging.
Good.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.086
As it turns out,
Hein, Larsen and Shaw

14:48.088 --> 14:49.420
all had something in common.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.256
Each one of them was
being investigated

14:51.258 --> 14:54.559
by an HPD homicide detective
named Philip Lau.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.594
Wait a minute,
this is... this is

14:56.596 --> 14:57.779
brand-new information.

14:57.780 --> 14:58.963
I don't see how that
didn't come up.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.532
Easy. It wasn't
an official investigation.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.402
As far as I can tell,
no reports were filed.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.037
He was looking into them
on his own.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.038
All right, um...
Okay.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.306
I'll get in touch
with Duke,

15:08.308 --> 15:09.540
and I'll tell him
we need to have

15:09.542 --> 15:10.575
a sit-down with this guy.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.576
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.344
Lau shot
and killed himself

15:13.346 --> 15:15.013
six months ago.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.317
We need to go through his files,
pull his notes.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.185
Yeah, I already have.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.453
There's not much there.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.188
Lau was looking
at each of the men

15:24.190 --> 15:25.623
for various open homicides,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.325
cold cases.
Hey!

15:27.327 --> 15:29.294
There was just never
enough evidence to arrest.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.263
Sorry to interrupt, but
HPD's got eyes on Langford.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.465
Good luck,
Commander.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.600
Detective.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.335
Yes. Thanks.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.340
(siren wailing)

15:42.342 --> 15:43.508
(tires screeching)

15:46.179 --> 15:48.212
(siren continues)

15:48.214 --> 15:49.480
(car horn blares)

15:49.482 --> 15:50.648
Hey, you want to see
what I had for breakfast?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.183
Keep driving like a jerk.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.717
Would you man up once in your life?
Man up?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.586
Man up. Man up! You
talking to me to man up?

15:55.588 --> 15:56.955
The guy who saved your life

15:56.957 --> 15:58.323
going through
life-threatening surgery?

15:58.325 --> 15:59.424
Oh... You gonna talk
to me like that?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.458
God, with
the liver again?

16:00.459 --> 16:01.491
How long you gonna
hold that over me?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.094
Forever.
Or until we die

16:03.096 --> 16:05.129
in a spectacular car crash
three minutes from now.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.431
(siren wailing)

16:15.241 --> 16:17.041
(car horn blares)

16:31.024 --> 16:32.457
(tires screeching)

16:35.462 --> 16:37.462
Hey, hey!

16:37.464 --> 16:39.163
(car horns blare)

16:48.274 --> 16:50.174
(tires screeching)

17:10.497 --> 17:12.096
(tires screech)

17:37.357 --> 17:39.257
Everybody down!
Five-O!

18:11.224 --> 18:12.490
(grunts)

18:39.786 --> 18:41.385
(cries out)

18:48.128 --> 18:51.129
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hands in the air.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.432
Hands in the air!
Yes, you.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.368
Now. Now. Yes.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.836
Back away.

19:00.173 --> 19:04.342
Well... I guess
we can call that a draw.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.886
Cufflinks with GPS
transponders.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.221
The sunglasses
are tricked out

19:17.223 --> 19:18.740
with infrared night vision,

19:18.741 --> 19:20.258
and the watch has a built-in
cellular jammer.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.425
Pretty sweet.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.327
Huh.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.264
What about this?

19:26.266 --> 19:28.466
That's for holding money
and credit cards.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.834
I've got to talk
to McGarrett about

19:29.836 --> 19:31.502
upgrading Five-O's
equipment.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.337
Oh, I haven't...
I haven't worked out

19:33.339 --> 19:34.472
the hidden feature
in that yet.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.443
(acid sizzling)

19:39.445 --> 19:40.912
You're welcome.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.182
(sizzling)

19:45.385 --> 19:46.717
DANNY:
<i> I know I'm in the minority,</i>

19:46.719 --> 19:48.619
but Roger Moore
was my favorite Bond.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.654
Oh, yeah?

19:49.656 --> 19:51.106
I mean, I grew up
watching him,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.557
so that's probably why,
but you...

19:52.559 --> 19:56.794
you seem like the, um...
the Daniel Craig type, right?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.496
I suppose we can't
all be Sean Connery.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.264
Well, how about this?

20:02.769 --> 20:05.086
(McGarrett exhales)

20:05.087 --> 20:07.404
That's $20 million worth
of diamonds right there.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.807
I bet that's more
than an MI6 pension.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.875
Commander, we both know

20:10.877 --> 20:12.410
I'm not going to
be here for long.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.413
My government will insist
that I be extradited.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.981
In the meantime how
about a cup of tea?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.382
Milk and sugar.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.917
DANNY:
That's pretty funny.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.588
Um, do you recognize
this girl?

20:23.590 --> 20:26.390
You should because your DNA
was found under her fingernails.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.360
There's a simple
explanation for that.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.233
(passionate moaning)

20:35.235 --> 20:37.301
STEVE:
<i> You had sex with her.</i>

20:37.303 --> 20:38.803
Doesn't mean you...
you didn't kill her.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.571
(sighs) Look, I'm
telling you this

20:40.573 --> 20:42.740
because time is
of the essence

20:42.742 --> 20:45.610
and I need to get out
of here as soon as possible.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.678
That file your
partner's holding

20:47.680 --> 20:48.946
is entirely fabricated.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.483
For the past three years
I've been infiltrating

20:52.485 --> 20:54.518
the illegal arms market
in order to track down

20:54.520 --> 20:55.753
a high-value target.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.656
So what you're saying is
MI6 disavowed you

20:58.658 --> 21:00.324
just to legitimize
your cover.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.525
Is that right?

21:01.527 --> 21:05.029
Obviously, I regret
ever involving Casta.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.464
She never knew she had
the diamonds on her,

21:06.466 --> 21:08.532
but she was alive when
I left her apartment.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.001
If you're looking
to make an arrest,

21:10.003 --> 21:12.637
I suggest you focus
your attention on Lucky Morad.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.375
If you want further verification
that what I'm saying is true,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.010
call the director
of the CIA.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.578
He's fully briefed
on this operation,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.980
which is a matter
of international security.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.882
And extremely
time-sensitive.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.484
I'll make the call.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.452
If your story checks out,
we'll release you.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.687
But there's a caveat.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.988
Go on.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.857
If you're gonna be
operating on this island,

21:32.859 --> 21:34.659
you do it under
our supervision.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.561
What, exactly,
does that mean?

21:37.563 --> 21:38.629
DANNY: It means that
whatever you're doing,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.498
we are now involved.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.599
Uh, so why don't you
let us know

21:41.601 --> 21:43.401
what we're dealing
with here.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.872
This is Nashid El Hamadi,
(computer beeping)

21:47.874 --> 21:49.774
mastermind behind
the bombing

21:49.776 --> 21:51.642
of the UK embassy
in Madrid in 2012.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.377
You've used one
of these before.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.545
Actually, it's my first time,

21:54.547 --> 21:55.780
but it seems pretty
straightforward.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.482
The attack left six dead,
dozens injured,

21:58.484 --> 22:00.084
and propelled El Hamadi
to the top

22:00.086 --> 22:01.719
of my government's
most-wanted list.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.054
We've known for some time
he's been planning

22:03.056 --> 22:04.922
a large-scale attack
somewhere in Europe.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.824
Then two weeks ago
we intercepted comms

22:06.826 --> 22:09.427
between him and Morad discussing
a deal for the Greystone.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.796
Okay, what exactly is
the Greystone?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.064
It's a next-gen
decryption tool

22:13.066 --> 22:15.433
capable of cracking
any computer network.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.402
So you're saying there's gonna
be a potential cyber attack?

22:18.404 --> 22:20.538
We don't know
the specifics.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.707
My plan was to intercept
the Greystone before

22:22.709 --> 22:24.809
El Hamadi's courier
took possession.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.811
But when I got to Morad's
penthouse to cracked the safe,

22:26.813 --> 22:29.013
the device was gone, and
in its place were the diamonds.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.114
Payment for the device.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.582
The trade had
already been made.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.683
Exactly.
I was too late.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.752
Now El Hamadi's man
is in the wind.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.355
Hey, there.
Jerry Ortega.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.956
I'm special consultant
for Five-O.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.725
But of course you are.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.059
So is it "Mr. Langford,"

22:42.061 --> 22:43.961
or is there a "double-O" number
I should be using?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.596
Harry is fine,
thank you.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.565
Okay. Harry.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.468
Well, here's
your stuff.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.570
Thank you.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.572
Did you fiddle with this?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.973
Maybe.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.742
Well, it's a good thing
you brought it back

22:57.744 --> 22:58.860
to me when you did.

22:58.861 --> 22:59.977
Another three minutes
and this building

22:59.979 --> 23:01.379
would have been reduced
to rubble.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.082
I'm kidding, old chap.
You're good.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.119
Can we get back
to the Greystone, please?

23:08.121 --> 23:10.788
Right, as I was saying,
El Hamadi's courier has it.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.757
I imagine he's on his way
to him as we speak. Right.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.526
Do you know who the courier is?
Unfortunately, no.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.128
My next play was
to approach Morad,

23:17.130 --> 23:19.563
offer him his diamonds back in
return for the courier's name,

23:19.565 --> 23:21.132
then grab him before
he could make delivery.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.067
I like it. Where's Morad now?

23:23.069 --> 23:25.569
Actually, he's due to attend
a black tie event downtown

23:25.571 --> 23:27.171
in less than two hours.
All right,

23:27.173 --> 23:29.874
a big party like that, Morad's
bound to have heavy security.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.041
If he doesn't want
to go quietly,

23:31.043 --> 23:32.643
there's gonna be
a lot of collateral.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.845
Chin's right, this needs
to be a surgical op.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.680
Hope you got
your tux pressed.

themselves this evening?

I don't know, man,
I think the dry-cleaner

24:32.638 --> 24:34.672
shrunk my damn tux.

We got eyes on Morad.

We're in position. GROVER
(over radio): Good.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.914
HPD's got all points
of egress covered.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.716

24:45.718 --> 24:47.518
All right,
you're on.

Wish me luck.

Oh, you don't
need any luck,

24:49.722 --> 24:52.156
not looking like that.

Yes, you are.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.196

25:52.184 --> 25:54.852

27:08.127 --> 27:09.293
You never said
to come alone.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.240
But before
we put you away,

27:23.242 --> 27:25.042
you're gonna tell us who
you gave the Greystone to.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.177
I sense there's
an "or" coming.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.749

No!

Lobster.
Lobster?

Where'd you get that?
Is it any good?

Yeah, it's pretty good.
Can I try one?

STEVE: Huh?

27:46.098 --> 27:47.331
Okay, okay, I'll tell you
what you want to know!

27:47.333 --> 27:48.999
Hold on. Hold on.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.101
Okay.
That's incredible.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.404
Yeah, right?
(whimpering)

27:53.406 --> 27:55.739

Amir Rabbab.
He has the Greystone.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.156
Okay, what's he plan on doing with it?
I don't know.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.024
You're lying.
I swear!

28:14.026 --> 28:16.193
The man that he
works for, El Hamadi,

28:16.195 --> 28:18.028
he's committed to
making his next move

28:18.030 --> 28:20.330
bigger than the
Madrid bombing.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.865
Where do we
find Rabbab?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.767
It's too late.

28:23.769 --> 28:26.236
He just took a plane
to Europe this morning.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.484
You all right?

28:40.486 --> 28:42.453
Ah, I see,
he's very upset

28:42.455 --> 28:44.054
that you have
your own jet

28:44.056 --> 28:45.767
and he doesn't get
to fly it.

28:45.768 --> 28:47.479
Do me a favor, shut up
for a minute, would you?

28:47.480 --> 28:49.191
Listen, you realize
you drop 5,000 feet

28:49.195 --> 28:52.262
we're probably gonna knock off
15 minutes of the flight time.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.031
We could do the same
by lightening the load.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.766
You look to be around
14 stone.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.868
Care to volunteer?

28:57.870 --> 28:59.303
You've got to, well,
excuse him, see,

28:59.305 --> 29:01.872
he's got, um,
control issues.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.040
STEVE:
I don't have control issues.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.508
Okay, I like to drive,

29:04.509 --> 29:05.975
unlike you, who likes to be
chauffeured everywhere.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.411
No, I don't... No, I don't like
to be chauffeured.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.163
I kind of don't have
a choice.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.914
And besides, why would you ever
want to fly an airplane again

29:10.916 --> 29:12.182
after what happened
last time?

29:12.184 --> 29:13.884
Not my fault.
What happened?

29:13.886 --> 29:15.352
What hap...
Well, let's just say that

29:15.354 --> 29:17.421
I am half the man
that I used to be

29:17.423 --> 29:19.156
in the liver department
because of him.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.891
Again, it's not my fault.
It wasn't my fault.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.193
DANNY: You know what else he is,
besides a putz?

29:23.195 --> 29:25.162
He is a, um...
a bullet magnet.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.364
Oh. I wish you'd
have mentioned that

29:27.366 --> 29:29.533
before I asked you two boys to come with.
(phone rings)

29:29.535 --> 29:31.034
You're getting a call
from home.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.770
Langford here.

29:32.772 --> 29:33.804
You're on with
Commander McGarrett

29:33.806 --> 29:34.805
and Detective Williams.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.841
(over phone)
Guys, it's Chin.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.876
We just intercepted a call
from Rabbab; he's in Prague.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.878
He's got a meeting set
in Stare Mesto.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.813
It's the old city,
one hour from now.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.314
All right, how soon
can we get there?

29:44.316 --> 29:45.983
Maybe 90 minutes.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.050
No, that's not
good enough.

29:47.052 --> 29:50.287
You might want
to buckle up.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.023
(engines revving)

30:20.986 --> 30:24.454
(tires screeching)

30:27.560 --> 30:29.827
Amir Rabbab,
get on the ground right now.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.828
Show me your hands!

30:30.830 --> 30:32.329
Right now!

30:32.331 --> 30:34.097
(people screaming)
STEVE: Get down!

30:45.978 --> 30:48.612
Don't move, don't move, or I'm
not gonna kill you, all right?

30:48.614 --> 30:49.913
Where is it?

30:49.915 --> 30:51.448
Where's the Greystone?

30:56.288 --> 30:58.055
He hasn't got it.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.025
STEVE:<i> Travel documents,</i>
<i> fake passport.</i>

31:03.429 --> 31:05.929
Looks like somebody was
getting ready to skip town.

31:05.931 --> 31:06.997
Look at this guy.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.132
He already unloaded
the Greystone.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.901
Is that right, Amir?

31:10.903 --> 31:12.903
Where's your boss now?
Where's El Hamadi?

31:12.905 --> 31:14.137
Why did he arrange
for the handoff

31:14.139 --> 31:15.239
to happen in Prague?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.306
What does he have planned?

31:16.308 --> 31:17.541
(door opens)

31:17.543 --> 31:19.276
Commander?

31:19.278 --> 31:20.878
There's an urgent call
for you.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.447
Okay, thank you.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.882
CHIN: Steve, we just heard
from Interpol.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.884
Nuclear sites across Europe
are reporting

31:26.886 --> 31:28.185
sudden loss of command
and control functions

31:28.187 --> 31:29.186
over their reactors.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.187
How many?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.555
GROVER:
At least a dozen so far.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.590
It gets worse.
In the last ten minutes,

31:33.592 --> 31:36.560
each reactor's coolant systems
have been compromised,

31:36.562 --> 31:39.296
and now core temperatures are
spiraling out of control.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.431
We made a model

31:41.433 --> 31:43.100
of the nuclear fallout,

31:43.102 --> 31:45.035
and given there's no time
for evacuations,

31:45.037 --> 31:46.470
we're looking at
immediate casualties

31:46.472 --> 31:48.939
in the thousands,
with millions more affected.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.008
Paris, Munich, London.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.477
Steve, this is gonna be
Chernobyl times a hundred.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.913
DANNY: Okay, so this was
El Hamadi's plan all along.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.147
He's weaponized
Europe's nuclear plants,

31:57.149 --> 31:59.049
turned them into bombs.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.184
According to Interpol, the hack
is coming from the east side.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.586
We'll have coordinates
within the hour.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.921
STEVE: No, it's
not good enough.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.956
We don't have
that kind of time.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.990
We need to break Rabbab.
We're gonna do it right now.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.431
What's this?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.466
What are you doing?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.578
(panting)

32:28.580 --> 32:30.647
Mr. Rabbab, we have,
unfortunately,

32:30.649 --> 32:32.582
run out of time.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.835
Which means your opportunity
to engage

32:34.836 --> 32:37.087
in a civilized exchange
is no longer on the table.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.188
And because I am bound

32:38.190 --> 32:40.123
to specific
rules of conduct,

32:40.125 --> 32:43.093
our parley has
come to an end.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.629
Unfortunately, for you,
those same rules

32:45.631 --> 32:48.332
don't apply to my friend
from the United States.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.700
Last chance, Amir.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.569
Where's the hacker
with the Greystone?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.338
Cheers, then.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.374
(electricity crackles)

33:00.212 --> 33:01.511
Wait. Wait.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.512
Wait.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.414
I'll tell you where he is.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.666
(explosion)

33:22.668 --> 33:25.435
(gunshots firing)

33:25.437 --> 33:27.504
STEVE:
Stay down!

33:45.424 --> 33:46.523
He's dead.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.762
The first reactor's
gone critical.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.263
<i> We've got less</i>
<i> than three minutes.</i>

33:55.100 --> 33:57.467
LANGFORD:
Well, that didn't work.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.703
DANNY:
Whoa, oh.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.171
What are you doing? Stop.
Let somebody else do this.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.373
Like who? I don't
know, like who.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.441
Some kind of person
who is qualified

34:04.443 --> 34:05.475
to do things with computers.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.077
Okay? Anyone...

34:07.079 --> 34:09.079
Hey!

34:09.081 --> 34:10.597
I realize you Americans

34:10.598 --> 34:12.114
like to solve your problems
with brute force,

34:12.117 --> 34:13.183
but there's an easier way.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.184
See?
He obviously knows

34:14.186 --> 34:15.385
how to work a computer.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.187
Uh-oh.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.488
DANNY:
"Uh-oh"? What is that?

34:18.490 --> 34:19.589
Is that, uh,
is that British

34:19.591 --> 34:21.124
for "everything's okay"
or what?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.658
There's a bug implanted.
It won't let me shut down.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.328
Watch your eyes.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.064
DANNY:
Oh! What the hell

34:27.066 --> 34:28.231
is the matter with you?!
STEVE: I fixed it.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.416
You fixed it?!

34:29.417 --> 34:30.600
Look at the computer.
Why would you do

34:30.602 --> 34:31.735
something like that?
I'm standing right here.

34:31.737 --> 34:32.853
I just fixed that.
I just fixed that.

34:32.854 --> 34:33.970
You're gonna shoot bullets
at a computer?!

34:33.971 --> 34:35.087
What'd I do? What are
you, a mechanic?!

34:35.088 --> 34:36.204
You fixed... LANGFORD: Chaps.

34:36.208 --> 34:36.773
What?
Huh.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.609
Reactor's stable.

34:39.611 --> 34:42.479
He had n... you had no idea
that that was gonna work.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.814
He said he needed
to shut it down.

34:43.816 --> 34:44.815
What did I do?

34:44.817 --> 34:45.816
I shut it down.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.685
Just say it.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.553
You're-you're a caveman
and God bless you.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.822
You're welcome.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.160
I just spoke to Chin.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.161
Told him we're
on our way home.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.362
Let's go. Come on.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.164
You know, I was thinking,
maybe we, uh...

35:01.166 --> 35:02.365
stop over in London.

35:02.367 --> 35:03.533
London?
Yeah, there's this,

35:03.535 --> 35:05.368
uh... this little pub
