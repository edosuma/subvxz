00:51.333 --> 00:56.239
You know, I blame myself
for this prostate cancer.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.076
If you have a character flaw,

00:59.111 --> 01:01.646
you're susceptible
to disease in that area.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.248
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

01:03.283 --> 01:05.685
It's a new theory of mine.
For example,

01:05.719 --> 01:08.255
I had a great aunt
who lived up in Newport.

01:08.290 --> 01:11.259
She used her beauty
selfishly...

01:11.294 --> 01:14.597
got married four times,
always for money.

01:14.631 --> 01:16.633
And then she had sinus cancer

01:16.667 --> 01:18.636
and her nose had to be removed.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.673
- Oh my God, the nose.
- I know, very disfiguring.

01:21.707 --> 01:26.079
Now there's me. You know, I've
been sexually out of control

01:26.113 --> 01:27.881
for 40 years.

01:27.916 --> 01:31.553
I mean, I've torn
through people's lives.

01:31.587 --> 01:34.290
So my punishment
is prostate cancer.

01:34.324 --> 01:36.726
George, you're being
way too hard on yourself.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.728
It's not good for
your immune system.

01:38.763 --> 01:40.464
No, I'm not being
too hard, Jonathan.

01:40.498 --> 01:45.270
I've been selfish.
I've been living like a demented God.

01:45.304 --> 01:47.573
Well, I wish I could live
like a demented God.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.909
I've been living like
a demented loser.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.145
No, this is about me.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.681
Look, I'm the only one who's
allowed to be negative here.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.416
But I suck at everything.

01:56.451 --> 01:58.352
I was broken up with again.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.855
I'm a lousy detective.
My parents had to bail me out.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.192
Name one private detective who goes
to his parents when he's in trouble.

02:04.227 --> 02:06.061
And I'm failing as a writer.

02:06.096 --> 02:07.863
I disagree with
everything you've said.

02:07.898 --> 02:10.265
There's nothing to disagree with.
These are statements of fact.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.003
I should probably just quit
everything and go to l school.

02:13.037 --> 02:16.341
Oh God no, that's horrible.
No, listen to me...

02:16.375 --> 02:19.044
Jonathan,
everything you do is f:

02:19.078 --> 02:21.079
Being a detective,
being a writer.

02:21.114 --> 02:23.349
Pay attention to a dying man.

02:23.384 --> 02:26.052
Keep doing what you're doing.
It's not boring.

02:26.086 --> 02:28.021
And that's all
that counts in life.

02:28.055 --> 02:30.958
George, you're not dying.

02:30.992 --> 02:32.926
You're gonna be okay.

02:32.961 --> 02:36.163
You're dating your doctor.
She cares about your prostate.

02:40.269 --> 02:42.204
But I may not be okay.

02:44.173 --> 02:45.908
You know, I was reading
Joan Didion,

02:45.942 --> 02:49.812
where she describes how her
husband died just like that.

02:49.846 --> 02:53.681
It just seems so unfair
that we can be turned off

02:53.716 --> 02:57.951
like a... like a switch,
like we never lived,

02:57.986 --> 02:59.820
like we never mattered.

03:02.356 --> 03:05.858
I don't want to be turned off.

03:05.893 --> 03:07.493
Okay.

03:07.527 --> 03:10.995
We both need to do a lot better
with our positive thinking.

03:11.030 --> 03:12.630
Mmm.

03:12.665 --> 03:15.165
What's something positive
we can think about?

03:15.199 --> 03:18.302
Uh...

03:18.336 --> 03:21.638
Oh no, that last bag
of pot you got me?

03:21.672 --> 03:24.507
Very dreamy.
Now that's positive.

03:24.541 --> 03:28.877
In my mind, I saw a dandelion

03:28.912 --> 03:31.379
turn into a tiger's paw.

03:31.414 --> 03:33.314
It was beautiful.

03:33.349 --> 03:35.383
Right.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.226
You're not what I had
in mind for a dick.

03:49.261 --> 03:52.161
I was expecting a piece
of beef... shoulders.

03:52.196 --> 03:54.797
Well, if you don't like my dimensions,
I thank you for the whiskey

03:54.831 --> 03:57.232
- and I'll be on my way.
- No no. No no no.

03:57.267 --> 04:00.568
I'm sorry.
You got expressive hands.

04:00.602 --> 04:02.902
That's a sign of intelligence
and I need somebody with brains.

04:02.937 --> 04:05.905
I'll take the compliment.
I'm short on them these days.

04:05.939 --> 04:09.441
So what's the nature of
your problem, Professor?

04:09.476 --> 04:11.243
Do you break into places
for clients?

04:11.277 --> 04:13.277
I've been known to.
What do you need done?

04:13.312 --> 04:16.480
Oh, I screwed up... bad.

04:16.514 --> 04:19.082
Look, I'll be Frank with you...
I'm a tenured Professor,

04:19.116 --> 04:21.117
but I'm also a junkie...

04:21.151 --> 04:23.218
functional.

04:23.253 --> 04:25.888
But I got in hock
to my dealers.

04:25.922 --> 04:29.191
I was desperate and I gave
them something valuable.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.793
- What did you give them?
- A signed first edition of "on the road."

04:31.827 --> 04:34.228
I convinced them it was
worth $1,000 on eBay.

04:34.263 --> 04:36.363
Wow.
I love Jack kerouac.

04:36.398 --> 04:39.132
What capote said about him
was completely unfair.

04:39.167 --> 04:41.501
Yeah, but I went online
after I gave it to him

04:41.535 --> 04:45.271
and I found out the book is
worth much more than I thought.

04:45.305 --> 04:49.374
I'm an idiot.
It could fetch as much as 75 grand.

04:49.408 --> 04:50.975
Holy shit.
That's a lot of money.

04:51.010 --> 04:53.678
That's right.
I could retire on that cash.

04:53.712 --> 04:56.013
And I need a new chair.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.915
You know,
when you're chairbound,

04:58.949 --> 05:00.650
hemorrhoids are very cruel.

05:00.684 --> 05:03.219
So where's the book now?

05:03.253 --> 05:05.420
I don't know.
But here's what I had in mind:

05:05.455 --> 05:08.323
Tomorrow their runner
drops off my bag of dope.

05:08.357 --> 05:10.892
You follow 'em
back to their base.

05:10.926 --> 05:12.893
When they're out,
you get the book.

05:12.928 --> 05:16.430
- Will you do it?
- Okay, I'll take the case.

05:16.464 --> 05:20.100
Ah, good. You come in a queer
package, but you got guts.

05:20.134 --> 05:22.535
- I had guts once.
- If you don't mind me asking,

05:22.569 --> 05:24.570
what kind of Professor
are you, Professor?

05:24.604 --> 05:26.138
I'm a novelist.

05:26.172 --> 05:28.406
I teach fiction writing
in the mfa program.

05:28.441 --> 05:32.543
Really? I'm a... I'm sorry,
I haven't heard of you.

05:32.577 --> 05:33.977
What books have you written?

05:34.012 --> 05:36.046
Just one.
It came out in '70.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.648
It was called
"the music that kills,"

05:38.682 --> 05:40.383
about a homicidal
concert pianist,

05:40.417 --> 05:42.351
goes nuts from
too much practicing.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.019
Why didn't you write
a second novel?

05:44.053 --> 05:46.588
Because I was afraid to.

05:51.861 --> 05:53.995
Shit.

05:54.029 --> 05:56.564
- There's ray.
- Oh my God, it's ray.

05:56.598 --> 05:58.166
Ma, look, there's ray.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.001
Ray! Ray!

06:00.035 --> 06:02.970
- Hey hi.
- Hi ray!

06:03.005 --> 06:05.672
Okay, girls.
Why don't you go with Molly Ann?

06:05.707 --> 06:06.806
Little ladies.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.508
The girls wanted to,
well, you know.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.843
It's funny bumping into you.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.578
Ha.
Only in Brooklyn.

06:13.612 --> 06:15.078
Yep.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.980
What happened to your forehead?

06:17.014 --> 06:21.016
Oh that? George shot me
with a rubber-bullet gun.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.784
- What?
- It doesn't matter

06:22.819 --> 06:26.121
I'm sorry about
that night with irwin...

06:26.155 --> 06:29.490
you know, your lover
with the orange pubes.

06:29.525 --> 06:31.826
Yeah, I know who
you're talking about.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.160
But it's all right.

06:33.194 --> 06:35.162
I haven't heard from him since.

06:35.196 --> 06:38.631
Oh, good good.
I mean...

06:38.666 --> 06:41.467
So did you...
did you read my comic book?

06:41.501 --> 06:44.703
Uh, I haven't had
the chance. I'm sorry.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.505
Did you listen to
the mix cd I made for you?

06:46.539 --> 06:49.007
I put Chet Baker on it because I know
that you like the shape of his nose.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.409
- Did you listen to that?
- Not yet, but I will.

06:51.443 --> 06:53.777
You should listen to it.
I mean, it tells the story

06:53.812 --> 06:55.846
of our relationship
in 18 songs.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.016
I kind of put them chronological
order from when we first met

07:00.050 --> 07:02.284
to the end part.

07:02.319 --> 07:03.685
Ray, I've got to go.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.088
Me too.
Yeah, okay.

07:07.123 --> 07:09.290
Okay, come on, guys.

07:16.030 --> 07:20.066
- Hey, is that leah?
- Yeah, you're late.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.435
That would have never happened had
you been here 10 minutes ago.

07:22.469 --> 07:23.836
Sorry.
I had insomnia.

07:23.870 --> 07:26.071
I masturbated like four
times to pass out,

07:26.105 --> 07:27.739
but I couldn't fall asleep
till 6:00 in the morning

07:27.773 --> 07:29.607
and then I slept late.
I'm sorry.

07:29.641 --> 07:32.309
So was it okay to see leah?

07:32.343 --> 07:35.445
No. That's the horrible
miracle of break-ups...

07:35.480 --> 07:38.147
three years together and then you act
like you don't even know each other.

07:38.182 --> 07:39.682
I'm sorry, ray.

07:39.716 --> 07:43.353
Super ray.
Thanks for coming in, man.

07:43.387 --> 07:46.222
- Bob, this is my friend Jonathan.
- Hi.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.091
Hey, I didn't want to
give it away in my email,

07:48.125 --> 07:50.960
but your comic book
selling like crazy.

07:50.994 --> 07:53.162
- What?
- Yeah. It's a hit, man.

07:53.196 --> 07:55.798
You might want to think about getting
a legit publisher for this thing.

07:55.832 --> 07:57.800
I mean, look,
self-publishing is cool,

07:57.834 --> 08:00.234
but I think the demand's
gonna be too great.

08:00.269 --> 08:02.837
Yo, let me get your money.

08:02.871 --> 08:05.006
Yeah okay.
Yeah, get it.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.575
Ray, this is wonderful.

08:07.610 --> 08:10.512
Are... are you the creator
of "super ray"?

08:10.546 --> 08:11.879
Uh, yes I am.

08:11.914 --> 08:14.415
- Could you sign my copy of your comic?
- Sure sure.

08:14.449 --> 08:17.050
We think it's so cool
that super ray gets his powers

08:17.084 --> 08:19.285
from his penis
hitting the third rail.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.287
Where do you get your ideas?

08:21.321 --> 08:24.723
- I smoke pot, then I draw.
- That's cool.

08:24.757 --> 08:27.091
Um, could you sign this page?

08:27.126 --> 08:28.560
It's my favorite.

08:28.594 --> 08:30.695
- Sure.
- It's so romantic.

08:30.729 --> 08:32.563
Super ray really loves leah.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.832
Yes he does.

08:34.866 --> 08:37.067
Okay, here you go.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.436
Are you a vulcan or an elf?

08:39.470 --> 08:42.172
Oh please, I'm an elf.

08:42.206 --> 08:44.507
Right, okay.
Sorry.

08:50.413 --> 08:52.481
I can't believe you did that.

08:52.515 --> 08:54.549
<i>- I know!
- Holy shit.</i>

08:54.584 --> 08:56.485
You're on a roll.
What's going on?

08:56.519 --> 08:58.720
I don't know.
But something is happening.

08:58.754 --> 09:00.655
Ever since I finished
the comic book,

09:00.689 --> 09:02.089
it's like I am super ray.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.992
I mean, aside from
leah crushing my balls,

09:06.027 --> 09:07.494
I'm feeling pretty good.

09:07.528 --> 09:09.829
It's cool. It's like
you're having some kind of

09:09.863 --> 09:12.231
a psychic transference
with your own character.

09:12.265 --> 09:16.768
Yes. Also my mom
gave me some advice

09:16.802 --> 09:18.736
from a self-help pamphlet
that she reads.

09:18.770 --> 09:21.171
She's always doing that because
of my dad's otb addiction

09:21.206 --> 09:22.639
and because of
her diabetes foot.

09:22.674 --> 09:24.474
- I forgot she has diabetes.
- Yes.

09:24.509 --> 09:26.376
She told me to visualize

09:26.410 --> 09:28.378
impossible things happening,
which I did.

09:28.412 --> 09:30.513
You know what I visualized?

09:30.547 --> 09:33.616
- Making money.
- I need to get that pamphlet.

09:33.650 --> 09:36.451
Super ray!
There's your money, ray.

09:36.486 --> 09:40.021
- Bang.
- ♪ Let's go have a drink ♪

09:40.055 --> 09:42.390
♪ right now and get drunk ♪

09:42.424 --> 09:44.558
♪ 16 gin and tonics. ♪

09:44.592 --> 09:46.826
It's not even noon.
I can't anyways.

09:46.861 --> 09:48.728
I've got to go to
midwood college for a case.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.563
- Do you want to come?
- Are you kidding?

09:50.597 --> 09:53.331
Last time I tried to help you,
George shot me in the head.

09:53.366 --> 09:56.667
What would a police duck

09:56.701 --> 09:59.402
say to a suicidal bear?

10:00.904 --> 10:03.405
"You can bear it."

10:03.440 --> 10:05.942
Oh God, that's terrible.

10:05.976 --> 10:09.212
I'm never gonna win this thing.

10:09.246 --> 10:11.380
- What are you doing?
- Ah.

10:11.414 --> 10:15.917
Um, I was just studying
"the new yorker."

10:15.952 --> 10:17.752
I had an idea too.

10:17.787 --> 10:20.821
Instead of the caption contest,
which is stupid,

10:20.856 --> 10:24.358
why don't we let readers
send in cartoons every week

10:24.392 --> 10:26.593
and we'll publish the best one?

10:26.627 --> 10:29.995
You know, I think people will love that.
That's not a bad idea.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.464
I have a friend, actually,
who's a cartoonist.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.432
No, I don't like cartoons.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.601
All right.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.103
So I just came by
to let you know

10:39.137 --> 10:41.405
that all "edition"
employees are subject

10:41.439 --> 10:44.808
to a mandatory random
drug test this afternoon.

10:44.842 --> 10:46.542
A drug test?
Oh no.

10:46.577 --> 10:49.979
No, listen, that is not
in the spirit of things

10:50.013 --> 10:52.147
that I have cultivated
here at "edition."

10:52.181 --> 10:55.383
I'm sorry. But it's protocol
for all subsidiaries

10:55.418 --> 10:57.485
of Wellstone media.
They require it.

10:57.519 --> 10:59.620
All right.
I'll inform the troops,

10:59.654 --> 11:01.621
but they're not gonna like it.

11:01.656 --> 11:03.523
Well, the troops
already know, George.

11:03.557 --> 11:05.891
I'm just here to inform you.

11:07.394 --> 11:10.395
I have to take a drug test?

11:12.398 --> 11:14.832
As soon as he leaves,
I'll go out on this balcony.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.600
Now you wait outside.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.703
When I spot him,
I'll give you this sign.

11:19.737 --> 11:21.905
I like that signal.
I've used it before.

11:21.939 --> 11:23.106
All right.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.208
I want to confess something,
Professor Hawkins.

11:26.243 --> 11:27.376
Yeah?

11:27.411 --> 11:31.814
You see, I'm also
a writer like you.

11:31.848 --> 11:33.682
I've published one novel.

11:33.716 --> 11:37.151
Oh no, I need a detective...
a man of action...

11:37.185 --> 11:40.520
not some effete scribbler.

11:40.555 --> 11:43.756
You've got to get that book for me.
I need that 75 grand.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.658
This chair is killing me.

11:45.692 --> 11:47.793
Don't worry.
I'm both...

11:47.827 --> 11:51.129
writer and detective.

11:51.163 --> 11:55.032
Uh, okay.
I get it.

11:55.066 --> 11:57.834
Yeah. That's good... a writer
needs to get his hands dirty,

11:57.869 --> 12:01.103
be steeped in vice.
I knew you had guts!

12:01.138 --> 12:03.839
- Thank you. - You know, you
should write about your cases

12:03.874 --> 12:05.307
like Dashiell hammett did.

12:05.341 --> 12:07.875
Oh shit!
He'll be here any minute.

12:07.909 --> 12:10.044
Go on, get downstairs.

12:16.351 --> 12:19.820
I'm definitely gonna
go to the meeting.

12:23.825 --> 12:26.126
Hello, Professor.

12:28.196 --> 12:32.197
- Jonathan? - Oh.
Hello, Louis. This is odd.

12:32.231 --> 12:34.196
What are you doing here
at midwood college?

12:34.230 --> 12:37.797
Let me guess... you're taking
a basic writing class.

12:37.832 --> 12:40.933
No, Louis, m not in school.
I'm on a case.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.936
Oh yes, I forgot about your
mental troubles in that area.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.037
Tell me, you weren't
a forceps baby, were you?

12:46.071 --> 12:48.072
Your skull
seems pinched on top.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.541
Shut up, Louis.
What are you doing here?

12:50.575 --> 12:53.443
I'm adjuncting in the English
department this semester.

12:53.477 --> 12:55.845
- You... really?
- Yes, of course.

12:55.879 --> 12:58.046
God, I would love
to teach here someday.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.515
I mean, this campus
is so romantic.

13:00.549 --> 13:02.884
And I'm already
very partial to sport coats,

13:02.918 --> 13:04.852
which is great
for being a Professor.

13:04.886 --> 13:07.321
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not cut out for academia.

13:07.355 --> 13:09.489
What are you going to do...
teach students how to write

13:09.524 --> 13:10.824
without flair or talent?

13:10.858 --> 13:14.026
<i>Greene, what exactly is
your problem with me?</i>

13:14.061 --> 13:16.862
Quite simply, you offend
me aesthetically.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.565
And I regret not thrashing you more
thoroughly in the boxing ring.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.666
But I won.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.601
I feel, in retrospect,
that I performed

13:23.635 --> 13:25.703
in the more dominating fashion.

13:30.274 --> 13:33.643
What?
Do I have something?

13:37.280 --> 13:39.380
But... where are you going?

13:39.414 --> 13:41.349
I'm sorry you're
so bitter, Greene.

13:41.383 --> 13:43.784
Must be difficult to have never
known the touch of a woman

13:43.819 --> 13:46.687
because you have the bloated head of
a pumpkin and breath like cat food.

13:46.721 --> 13:49.155
Well, at least I don't advertise
myself on Craig's list

13:49.190 --> 13:50.824
like some kind of whore.

13:50.858 --> 13:54.026
Calling yourself
a private detective! Ha!

13:54.060 --> 13:58.163
I suppose it's better than
calling yourself a writer.

14:07.272 --> 14:09.573
- Here you go.
- Thank you, maestro.

14:13.977 --> 14:18.147
Can I get a couple of shots of a nice
whiskey for me and the lady, please?

14:18.181 --> 14:20.349
Sure.

14:28.957 --> 14:31.959
Two more, please.

14:36.997 --> 14:38.664
So what's the big occasion?

14:38.698 --> 14:41.766
I came into a little bit
of money today.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.001
So I guess you can buy me
another drink.

14:44.035 --> 14:45.469
Sure.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.476
Sorry about that.

14:56.113 --> 14:58.748
So what's your name?

14:58.783 --> 15:01.484
- Trouble.
- Trouble.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.120
That was my mom's name.

15:04.155 --> 15:07.190
Oh, that's good.
That's smoky.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.658
<i>- Two more.
- Sure.</i>

15:09.693 --> 15:12.127
You could grow on a person.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.196
I have.

15:15.230 --> 15:17.564
So what's your middle name?

15:17.598 --> 15:18.998
Carol.

15:19.033 --> 15:22.033
Carol.
That's my father's name.

15:53.795 --> 15:56.727
Oh hey. Walter, right?
How you doing?

15:56.761 --> 16:00.159
I'm fine, but my name
is Steven, Mr. Christopher.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.660
Right right, sorry.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.428
I'm just wondering, Steven...

16:03.463 --> 16:06.364
see, I took this
anti-diuretic

16:06.399 --> 16:08.833
and I am...
I'm very very dry.

16:08.867 --> 16:12.736
Any chance that you could
fill up my urine cup for me?

16:12.770 --> 16:15.070
I mean, it's embarrassing
if all I had

16:15.104 --> 16:17.105
was a few meager droplets,
right?

16:17.139 --> 16:18.673
I don't understand.

16:18.707 --> 16:21.642
All I'm saying is
a young fellow like yourself

16:21.676 --> 16:24.310
probably has enough
urine for two people.

16:24.344 --> 16:25.911
Now is that too much to ask?

16:25.945 --> 16:28.146
Excuse me, Mr. Christopher,

16:28.181 --> 16:30.916
I... I have to go look
at something on my computer.

16:30.951 --> 16:33.555
Ha! Ha.
All right.

16:33.589 --> 16:36.458
Shit.

16:36.492 --> 16:39.560
Hey.
Bobby, right?

16:39.595 --> 16:41.328
How old are you?

17:06.718 --> 17:08.319
George, listen...

17:08.353 --> 17:10.721
Jonathan, Jonathan,
how long does marijuana

17:10.755 --> 17:13.522
stay in a person's system?
Is it more than 24 hours?

17:13.558 --> 17:16.626
- I'm not sure. Listen... - Well, shit,
you're supposed to know these things.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.394
<i>Why?
I'm not an expert.</i>

17:18.428 --> 17:22.030
I did hear something about marijuana
staying in our fatty tissues...

17:22.065 --> 17:23.365
- oh oh.
- What the fuck are you doing?

17:23.398 --> 17:25.133
<i>- George, I have to go.
- No no!</i>

17:25.166 --> 17:28.234
I need help. Oh.

17:28.270 --> 17:31.104
I was just inspecting
the ceiling of your window here

17:31.139 --> 17:32.906
and you're definitely at
risk for leakage.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.408
You a fuckin' cop?
You look like a cop.

17:35.442 --> 17:36.943
I do?

18:00.130 --> 18:02.597
Oh no, that's...

18:05.034 --> 18:06.734
I swear I'm not a cop.

18:06.769 --> 18:09.637
I was just walking by
and I was drawn to your window.

18:09.671 --> 18:13.006
I admit it...

18:13.040 --> 18:15.007
I'm a voyeur.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.175
What the fuck is a voyeur?

18:17.210 --> 18:19.644
You know, like a peeping Tom.

18:19.679 --> 18:22.714
- Who the fuck is Tom?
- Yeah, who the fuck is that?

18:30.954 --> 18:34.523
How'd you get that band-aid?

18:34.558 --> 18:36.525
Police work with friends.

18:36.559 --> 18:41.597
Mmm. That's sexy.

18:41.631 --> 18:45.266
Mmm. My God,
mm-hmm. Look at this thing.

18:45.301 --> 18:46.367
Mm-hmm.

18:46.402 --> 18:48.536
It's so beardy.

18:48.570 --> 18:50.003
Mm-hmm.

18:50.038 --> 18:52.438
I want to go down on it.

18:55.675 --> 18:57.508
I don't like that.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.143
- My dad had a beard.
- Mmm.

19:00.178 --> 19:03.712
He died when I was 16
of esophageal hemorrhages...

19:03.747 --> 19:05.980
From drinking.

19:06.015 --> 19:08.316
- I'm gonna be a dad.
- Mmm?

19:08.351 --> 19:11.853
These two lesbians
in ditmas park

19:11.887 --> 19:13.488
got ahold of my sperm

19:13.522 --> 19:16.191
and they're
six months' pregnant.

19:16.225 --> 19:19.493
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
ballowed to see the child, but...

19:19.528 --> 19:21.729
I don't want to hear
about your other women.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.430
Sorry.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.968
Boop boop.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.208
You should let me go
and hurt him.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.244
I'm just a writer. I'm doing a
piece on him for "the new yorker."

19:41.278 --> 19:44.112
- You are? - I was thinking about
a "talk of the town" piece.

19:44.147 --> 19:47.214
You know, they're always about marginal
crackpots living on the edge of reality...

19:47.248 --> 19:50.084
your whole Walter mitty delusion
about being a detective.

19:50.118 --> 19:52.387
See, these motherfuckers
are detectives.

19:52.421 --> 19:53.521
- No no no!
- Listen, guys, guys!

19:53.556 --> 19:55.759
We are not undercover cops.
I swear.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.298
I'll buy pot from you.
Would a cop buy pot?

19:58.333 --> 20:00.266
I have a friend...
he has cancer.

20:00.301 --> 20:03.569
He needs marijuana.
Now my own dealer disappeared recently.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.571
That's probably because
you put him away.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.606
Yeah, don't try that
entrapment bullshit, assholes.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.742
There's only one way to know
whether a cop is a cop.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.410
Here you go.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.379
Snort this, 5-0,
and show us you ain't a cop.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.715
I refuse.
That house key is very dirty

20:17.749 --> 20:20.050
and I've never done anything
stronger than a vodka gimlet.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.785
- So...
- Snort it.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.386
- I just couldn't...
- Snort it.

20:23.421 --> 20:24.921
I have terrible nasal polyps.

20:34.863 --> 20:36.864
- Run!
- It says "don't walk."

20:36.898 --> 20:38.665
Just run!

20:45.638 --> 20:48.639
You know, I still can't believe
you thought for a moment

20:48.674 --> 20:50.642
that you could teach
at midwood college.

20:50.676 --> 20:52.644
Would you just shut up?
I could teach there.

20:52.678 --> 20:54.679
I'm teaching at metropolitan
writers workshop.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.514
Ha!
That rip-off night school?

20:56.549 --> 20:59.384
The only students there
are ex-cons and subnormals.

20:59.418 --> 21:00.719
<i>Ah! Fuckety!</i>

21:00.753 --> 21:04.021
Oh shit. Come on.
Come on.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.489
Come on.

21:05.524 --> 21:06.790
Ah!

21:08.793 --> 21:11.394
I can't.
I can't go on.

21:11.428 --> 21:12.995
Oh, listen to me.

21:13.030 --> 21:15.731
You bastard.
You've reduced my life to a b movie.

21:15.765 --> 21:18.399
You know, go
get help, you idiot.

21:18.433 --> 21:20.567
I'll hide behind these logs.

21:20.602 --> 21:24.304
Okay.
I'll be back.

21:24.338 --> 21:26.239
I just want you to know
that even though

21:26.273 --> 21:28.174
you're the most horrible
person I've ever met,

21:28.208 --> 21:30.374
- I won't leave you here to die.
- Go, you idiot!

21:30.409 --> 21:32.874
Oh, sentimental claptrap.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.611
- Follow his footprints!
- Turn right.

21:37.646 --> 21:39.677
<i>- All right, all right.
- I don't see him!</i>

21:39.712 --> 21:42.112
Oh, come on, man.

21:52.623 --> 21:55.725
Louis:

22:02.465 --> 22:04.298
What are you looking for?
What you lookin' for?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.567
Oh, you didn't.

22:13.873 --> 22:16.475
Get away from me.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.910
Sighs )

22:27.519 --> 22:29.353
Come here.
Come on.

22:29.387 --> 22:30.755
Let's go.

22:30.789 --> 22:32.189
- Ah!
- This way.

22:32.224 --> 22:33.891
Gotta get my bag of pot
and the book.

22:33.926 --> 22:35.893
My ankle will never
be the same because of you.

22:35.927 --> 22:37.928
Shut up, Louis.
I just saved your life.

22:41.464 --> 22:43.796
George, we need to talk.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.931
Sure, come on in.

22:45.965 --> 22:50.535
I'm working on my column,
but it can wait for you.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.471
I'm going to speak very slowly

22:53.505 --> 22:56.139
because you're probably
stoned right now.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.641
Your urine

22:58.676 --> 23:01.244
tested off the charts

23:03.413 --> 23:04.446
what? For thc.

23:04.481 --> 23:07.215
You already got the results?

23:07.250 --> 23:10.018
Onsite lab, George...
very high-tech.

23:10.052 --> 23:12.553
And adding soap
to your specimen

23:12.587 --> 23:14.188
wasn't very clever.

23:14.222 --> 23:17.390
Soap? Oh no.
There must be a mistake.

23:17.425 --> 23:20.259
I mean, it happens
all the time at the Olympics...

23:20.294 --> 23:23.562
somebody's sample gets
confused with somebody else's.

23:23.596 --> 23:26.198
You know, I've noticed
that Walter has...

23:26.232 --> 23:29.901
Steven has sometimes very red beady eyes.
Have you...

23:29.935 --> 23:32.870
George, you're going
to have to go to rehab.

23:32.904 --> 23:35.772
Company policy.
We usually send people

23:35.807 --> 23:38.008
to a very nice place
in Arizona.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.643
Ariz... oh Jesus.

23:39.677 --> 23:42.411
The dry air is
good for sobriety.

23:48.484 --> 23:50.985
Katherine?

23:51.019 --> 23:53.054
I haven't wanted to tell anyone

23:53.088 --> 23:57.090
because I didn't want to frighten
anyone here at the office,

23:57.125 --> 24:00.493
- but I have prostate cancer.
- What?

24:00.527 --> 24:02.828
I can get you a doctor's note
and everything.

24:02.863 --> 24:06.231
I admit I've been
smoking marijuana,

24:06.265 --> 24:08.633
but for medicinal purposes.

24:08.668 --> 24:11.002
It's why I failed
the drug test.

24:11.036 --> 24:14.671
Oh, George, I'm very
sorry about your cancer.

24:14.706 --> 24:17.940
It's okay. It's... I'm sure
everything will turn out all right.

24:17.974 --> 24:19.942
My doctor is wonderful.

24:19.976 --> 24:22.410
We started dating, actually.

24:22.445 --> 24:25.680
You're dating your doctor?
Did you get a second opinion?

24:25.714 --> 24:29.517
No no, but you know,
she has very good taste.

24:29.552 --> 24:33.253
So no no, I trust her.

24:33.287 --> 24:35.889
All right.
Well, you'll let me know

24:35.923 --> 24:38.058
if there's anything
I can do to help.

24:38.092 --> 24:39.859
Of course, Katherine.

24:39.893 --> 24:41.160
Okay.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.635
♪ I don't have to
go to rehab. ♪

24:52.669 --> 24:56.504
I have cancer.

25:03.977 --> 25:06.712
So Greene is down on the ground

25:06.746 --> 25:08.514
<i>like piggy in
"lord of the flies"</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:10.348
<i>and I just can't
leave him there.</i>

25:10.383 --> 25:14.052
So I swoop in... hyah hyah!

25:14.086 --> 25:16.254
Hyah hyah! Bam!

25:16.289 --> 25:18.890
I mean, it was like I was having
an out-of-body experience.

25:18.924 --> 25:21.592
I took them all out, George.
It was incredible.

25:21.627 --> 25:23.793
I am so proud of you, dear boy.

25:23.828 --> 25:26.596
I think it's because of this
pamphlet that ray's mom read.

25:26.630 --> 25:28.866
It's all about visualizing
delusional things

25:28.900 --> 25:32.471
- and then believing in them.
- Isn't that like schizophrenia?

25:32.505 --> 25:35.374
You have a point.
Maybe just as an exercise,

25:35.408 --> 25:38.078
you should visualize that
your prostate is cancer-free.

25:38.112 --> 25:42.049
You know I have an open mind to all these things.
I'll try anything.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.650
Good. I'm gonna try.

25:43.685 --> 25:46.118
I'm gonna visualize three
delusional things for myself...

25:46.153 --> 25:49.288
that I'm a successful writer,
detective and college Professor.

25:49.322 --> 25:51.456
I like all those
professions for you.

25:51.491 --> 25:53.724
Yeah. And what's good
about all these jobs

25:53.758 --> 25:57.059
is you wear basically the
same outfit... sport coats...

25:57.094 --> 25:59.361
so you save money.
And I look good in them.

25:59.395 --> 26:01.797
Can I show you
again how I took them all out?

26:01.831 --> 26:03.532
- Of course.
- Okay.

26:03.567 --> 26:05.534
So here I am standing
in the trees, right?

26:05.568 --> 26:07.302
Now Greene is down
on the ground here

26:07.337 --> 26:08.737
and he's looking
for his glasses.

26:08.771 --> 26:10.705
That's my favorite part.

26:10.740 --> 26:13.308
Now I'm here.
I go like that...

26:32.456 --> 26:35.156
Where am I?

26:35.191 --> 26:37.158
Who are you?

26:37.192 --> 26:39.426
I'll tell you later.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.568
Whatever you do,
do not flush the toilet.
