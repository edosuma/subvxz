We're too small

but we have someone
working on it.

No.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.782
I've noticed the fort.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.451
It's in a poor state
of repair.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.586
AQUILA: Now, that I was
not expecting.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.754
Why did you save him?

32:18.186 --> 32:19.529
Stephanos!

32:22.065 --> 32:23.408
Stephanos!

32:28.280 --> 32:32.251
I decided Stephanos is too
old to serve two masters.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.666
I bought you your
own body slave.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.338
I don't need
my own slave.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.799
Marcus.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.176
I should have
been consulted.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.425
Yeah, well,
you weren't.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.847
Slave!

32:57.476 --> 32:59.353
His name's Esca.

33:04.566 --> 33:05.863
I've no use for you.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.489
I had no wish
to be bought.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.741
You should have run.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.998
My uncle wouldn't
have stopped you.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.370
You saved my life.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.291
I have a debt of
honor to you now.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.666
Against your wish.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.836
No man should ever
beg for his life.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.042
You didn't.

33:22.501 --> 33:26.222
I did, on your behalf.
And I meant nothing by it.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.928
I am a son
of the Brigantes,

33:34.179 --> 33:35.772
who never broke his word.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.192
My father's dagger
is my bond.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.986
I hate everything
you stand for.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.442
Everything you are.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.028
But you saved me.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.782
And for that,
I must serve you.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.340
SURGEON:
Who searched this wound?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.676
The surgeon at the fort.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.799
Was he drunk?
I've never seen such a mess.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
You must have been
in constant pain.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.717
AQUILA: Sent him 200 leagues
in a mule cart.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.052
Nearly killed him.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.810
SURGEON: I'm gonna have to re-open it.
There's still metal in there.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.643
Well, if it's got to be done,
let him do it, right?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.396
It'll be over
before you know it.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.148
I have the best knives
in the business.

34:35.614 --> 34:36.831
Some wine.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.266
Ready?
Ready.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.307
You can go.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.569
No! I'm gonna need the
slave to hold you down.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.564
MARCUS: Can't
my uncle do it?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.570
Me? No.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.533
No, I've grown to hate
the sight of blood.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.616
Especially the blood of
someone I'm quite fond of.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.834
Be strong.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.757
Quickly now.
Hold him down.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.178
Put your weight
on him, slave!

35:31.838 --> 35:32.885
Harder!

35:34.382 --> 35:35.929
Take a deep breath.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.228
When I say,
"Now," let it out.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.648
Now!

35:41.723 --> 35:43.350
(GROANS)

36:17.133 --> 36:18.760

36:38.780 --> 36:40.282
Did I shame myself?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.467
Thank you.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.724
There he is.

Cut him off! Cut him off!

37:46.556 --> 37:49.651
CLAUDIUS: As I remember it,
he seemed pretty fond of you.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.521
Marcus.

37:53.980 --> 37:58.611
May I present my nephew,
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.204
Claudius Marcellus,
my old friend,

38:01.404 --> 38:04.032
and the esteemed Legate
of the Sixth Legion.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.250
Your uncle's an
old sparring partner.

38:07.410 --> 38:12.382
Tribune Servius Placidus.
An indispensable member of my staff.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.546
Pleasure.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.755
Supper's ready.
Boiled eggs and fish.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.341
Don't all rush at once.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.721
(ALL CHUCKLE)

38:24.677 --> 38:27.271
PLACIDUS: If it was my choice,
I'd be a soldier all my life.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.733
However, my father will
insist I go into politics.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.646
Have we met before?
Your name sounds familiar.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.363
I doubt it.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.157
The Tribune's Club, in Rome?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.988
(CHUCKLING)

38:40.068 --> 38:42.241
No, I was only
a Cohort Centurion.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.247
Ah, right,
I remember now.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.036
Flavius Aquila.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.083
Your father marched with the
Eagles, too, did he not?

38:49.577 --> 38:51.579
He commanded the
First Cohort of the Ninth.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.041
Of course. The Ninth.

38:55.625 --> 38:56.968
Every Roman
remembers the Ninth.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.590
Talking of the Ninth,

39:01.673 --> 39:04.017
there's been rumor
recently along the wall.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.639
Rumors. Rumors!

39:06.845 --> 39:09.064
Britain's full of
nothing but rumors.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.774
CLAUDIUS: They say
The Eagle's been seen

39:13.059 --> 39:16.905
receiving divine honors in some
tribal temple in the far north.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.157
An Eagle in the hands of the Painted People.
A potent weapon.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.028
One has to wonder how any
Roman could let it go.

39:24.571 --> 39:28.246
If this were to be true,
surely we should act.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.536
Well, what would Rome say?

39:31.786 --> 39:34.881
Eagle lost, honor lost.
Honor lost, all lost.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.800
Rome would love
to get The Eagle back,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.503
but politics
being politics,

39:40.128 --> 39:42.972
no senator's gonna risk thousands
of lives on a tainted legion.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.309
My hands are tied.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.845
MARCUS: Not if
you sent one man.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.477
AQUILA: North of the wall?

39:53.349 --> 39:55.727
No Roman could
survive up there.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.441
Has anyone ever tried?

39:57.520 --> 40:00.524
No, and that's
the point, militarily.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.238
To try would be to fail.
How do you know?

40:04.193 --> 40:06.321
One man can hide
where an army can't.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.373
No one would even
know he was there.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.617
It's too risky.
PLACIDUS: Quite right.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.670
The loss of the Ninth
was humiliating enough

40:13.745 --> 40:15.497
without adding another
pointless death.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.672
AQUILA: Marcus.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.054
Marcus.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.442
You can't let the likes
of him do this to you.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.987
He has no notion of how you
and I have lived our lives.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.112
Ever since
I can remember,

40:47.528 --> 40:51.203
all I've ever wanted to be was
a soldier, like my father.

40:51.324 --> 40:52.371
I know.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.956
I can still
see him now,

40:55.036 --> 40:56.583
riding away
for the last time.

40:56.663 --> 40:59.257
I can still feel
how proud I was.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.088
My father,

41:05.964 --> 41:08.308
Centurion of the First
Cohort of the Ninth Legion.

41:08.383 --> 41:11.728
Can you imagine
anything more magnificent

41:11.886 --> 41:14.685
than to be a soldier
and to serve Rome

41:14.764 --> 41:16.357
with courage
and faithfulness?

41:16.432 --> 41:18.560
But you did, son.
For what?

41:19.394 --> 41:20.691
For what?

41:23.564 --> 41:24.907
An honorable discharge?

41:24.983 --> 41:26.200
That is fate.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.577
That's in the hands
of the gods.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.074
When I made Centurion,

41:33.616 --> 41:36.961
they asked me where
I wanted to be posted.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.080
I knew the answer before
they had even asked it.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.625
Britain.
Britain.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.964
This is where my
father lost The Eagle.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.011
This is where I was
gonna win so much glory

41:46.087 --> 41:48.931
that no Roman would ever dare
bring up his name again.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.509
What do I do now?
What do I do?

41:51.592 --> 41:54.516
I sit and I listen to some
silk-ass politician's son

41:54.595 --> 41:56.768
piss on our
family's name!

42:00.435 --> 42:02.904
I will not sit in some villa
for the rest of my days,

42:03.229 --> 42:04.481
rotting and remembering.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.736
(LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY)

42:07.442 --> 42:09.695
If I can't win back
my family's honor

42:09.777 --> 42:11.199
by being a soldier,

42:13.573 --> 42:15.325
then I'll do it by
finding the lost Eagle.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.577
You can't.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.377
No Roman can survive
north of the wall alone.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.384
You can't.
Then I'll take Esca.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.378
I can use his knowledge.
He speaks the language.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.009
Esca?
Why not?

42:31.340 --> 42:32.762
Because he's a Briton.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.308
He may not be from
north of the wall,

42:37.138 --> 42:38.185
but he's a Briton.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.652
And he will slit your throat
the minute you're alone.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.775
He wouldn't do that.
How do you know?

42:44.854 --> 42:45.946
He gave me his word!

42:46.689 --> 42:47.815
His word?

42:48.733 --> 42:50.201
He's a slave!

42:51.486 --> 42:55.241
He says what he says and he does
what he does because he has to.

42:57.158 --> 42:59.331
Once you're beyond
the territories...

43:00.912 --> 43:01.959
MARCUS: If I'm wrong,

43:03.456 --> 43:04.628
then I'll die.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.173
And that's how it should be.

44:26.414 --> 44:27.586
Where are you headed?

44:28.708 --> 44:29.800
North.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.840

is the end of the world?

gate, soldier.

45:52.295 --> 45:53.592
Rogue warriors.

46:19.572 --> 46:20.824
You know, sometimes,

46:22.826 --> 46:26.080
I dream that I'll find
my father alive up here.

46:27.163 --> 46:29.791
That he survived in
some hidden place.

46:32.210 --> 46:33.382
Is that why you're here?

46:34.838 --> 46:36.385
To find your father?

46:36.464 --> 46:37.716
No.

46:39.384 --> 46:40.761
We're here to
find The Eagle.

46:42.554 --> 46:44.773
How can a piece of metal
mean so much to you?

46:47.934 --> 46:49.561
The Eagle is not
a piece of metal.

46:50.687 --> 46:51.813
The Eagle is Rome.

46:53.982 --> 46:55.359
It's a symbol
of our honor.

46:56.860 --> 46:58.828
Every victory.
Every achievement.

47:01.740 --> 47:05.995
Wherever The Eagle is,
we can say that Rome did that.

47:14.419 --> 47:15.591
You wouldn't understand.

47:17.255 --> 47:18.427
How could you?

47:24.763 --> 47:26.106
My father was Cunoval,

47:27.599 --> 47:29.897
bearer of the Blue War
Shield of the Brigantes.

47:31.019 --> 47:32.612
Lord of 500 spears.

47:36.274 --> 47:37.947
Seven years ago,
you took our lands

47:39.319 --> 47:40.821
and we rose against you.

47:43.990 --> 47:45.492
My father and
two brothers died.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.372
My mother, also.

47:52.457 --> 47:54.801
My father killed her before the
legionaries broke through.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.135
He knew what they
would do to her.

48:04.677 --> 48:06.475
She knelt in front of him
and he slit her throat.

48:11.643 --> 48:12.986
Rome also did that.

48:42.841 --> 48:43.842
The Highlands.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.102
Which way?

48:47.178 --> 48:48.350
It's up to you.

01:30:23.756 --> 01:30:25.008
I can't go on.

01:30:25.341 --> 01:30:27.685
Yes, you can.
You just need to rest.

01:30:30.512 --> 01:30:32.059
Take The Eagle.

01:30:32.514 --> 01:30:34.232

come back.

(COUGHING)

01:30:36.727 --> 01:30:39.697
If not,
just keep south.

01:30:40.397 --> 01:30:42.445
Make sure this
gets back to Rome.

01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:43.867
I'm not leaving you here.

01:30:44.902 --> 01:30:47.746
Do not dishonor me.
Take it.

01:30:48.113 --> 01:30:49.660
I came this
far with you.

01:30:50.866 --> 01:30:52.209
I won't leave you now.

01:30:54.244 --> 01:30:55.370
Esca,

01:30:56.372 --> 01:30:57.464
I order you.

01:30:58.290 --> 01:30:59.416
Take it.

01:31:02.211 --> 01:31:06.216
I swore an oath of honor
never to abandon you.

01:31:09.385 --> 01:31:10.807
If you want me to leave,

01:31:12.596 --> 01:31:13.893
set me free.

01:31:16.433 --> 01:31:17.776
Give me my freedom.

01:31:34.743 --> 01:31:36.165
You're free.

01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:42.839
You're free, my friend.

01:31:50.676 --> 01:31:51.802
Take it.

01:31:51.885 --> 01:31:53.011
No.

01:32:00.019 --> 01:32:01.362
I will return.

ESCA: Your
father's legionaries.

01:35:56.838 --> 01:35:57.930
You were wrong.

01:35:59.174 --> 01:36:00.551
The dead can live.

01:36:03.512 --> 01:36:06.356
My shame would not allow me
to tell you this before,

01:36:07.516 --> 01:36:09.610
but I watched
your father die.

01:36:11.812 --> 01:36:15.362
Whatever anyone tells you,
he was not a coward.

01:36:16.858 --> 01:36:19.657
He stood his ground
to the very end.

01:36:22.364 --> 01:36:23.490
I saw it.

01:36:24.866 --> 01:36:28.086
The last Roman to hold The
Eagle was your father.

01:36:31.373 --> 01:36:32.545
The order, sir.

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.883
You've honored my
father's memory enough.

01:36:39.131 --> 01:36:41.304
You don't have to do this.
No.

I congratulate you.
Rome congratulates you.

01:44:56.171 --> 01:44:58.640
And your family's
good name is restored.

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.725
The Senate will want
to re-form the Ninth.

01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:08.525
Perhaps they can reward
you with its command.

01:45:11.102 --> 01:45:12.649
However did you do it?

01:45:13.313 --> 01:45:14.986
With only a slave
to help you.

01:45:15.065 --> 01:45:16.282
He's not a slave!

01:45:18.693 --> 01:45:21.412
And he knows more about honor
and freedom than you ever will.

01:45:33.416 --> 01:45:34.542
So what now?

01:45:36.962 --> 01:45:38.259
