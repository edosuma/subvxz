02:12.933 --> 02:14.535
One player
from Grant High,

02:14.568 --> 02:15.836
one player from
Spotswood High.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.405
You okay?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.507
- Yeah, it just sucks to miss.
- Don't worry, Em.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.908
I'll get my shots.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.311
- And then we'll win.
- Thanks.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.447
And if you do,
we'll celebrate tonight.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.183
But without my
dumbass parents.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.918
At least they came.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.586
Yeah.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.256
- What the hell, Em?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.258
Did Daniel do this?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.592
I've been practicing
too hard.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.563
Funny how he never
likes to be around

Come talk to me.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.922
Listen, I know we put
a lot of pressure on you.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.392
It's because I know
you can handle it.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.827
I want you to
remember something
when you're up there.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.298
These people
don't matter.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.401
If you had to,
you could kill
any one of them

03:20.434 --> 03:22.570
just by letting go.

Okay.

* Keep the blood pumpin',
I was built for this *

and plus, it was buy one,
get one free, so...

05:20.521 --> 05:21.589
[laughing]

05:21.622 --> 05:23.391
Come on,
you don't need my help.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.465
Can I ask you something?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.371
[sighs]

05:40.708 --> 05:43.777
Why do you
put up with Daniel?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.679
I'm sorry,
the guy is a defect.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.048
They put a recall out on him
in middle school.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.519
You know,
when you insult him,
it's like...

05:51.552 --> 05:54.121
you're insulting me, too.

05:54.154 --> 05:59.760
So... why don't you just
talk to me about it

05:59.793 --> 06:01.395
when you've actually had
a boyfriend.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.734
If that's what it's like,

06:06.767 --> 06:08.035
I don't want one.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.444
You could have
anyone you want.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.557
Think so?

06:42.135 --> 06:44.438
What's wrong?

06:44.472 --> 06:45.606
You're drunk.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.845
So?

06:57.685 --> 07:02.690
* I'll tell you something

07:05.125 --> 07:10.063
* I'll tell you something

07:10.097 --> 07:13.200
* I don't know what to do

07:13.233 --> 07:16.804
* With you, with you,
with you *

07:16.837 --> 07:20.674
* I don't know what to do

07:20.708 --> 07:24.812
* With you, with you,
with you *

07:24.845 --> 07:28.081
* I don't know what to do

07:28.115 --> 07:31.619
* With you, with you,
with you *

07:33.821 --> 07:37.891
* With you

07:41.128 --> 07:45.766
* With you

07:49.870 --> 07:51.471
* With you

07:57.177 --> 08:00.881
* And if I were your girl

08:02.883 --> 08:04.217
[pounding]

08:04.251 --> 08:06.186
- Man: Emily!
- Shit.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.721
Is that Daniel?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.790
I, um--
I texted him.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.625
Before the meet.
I didn't think
he was gonna come.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.860
[pounding]

08:12.893 --> 08:15.663
Don't answer it.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.897
I have to.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.771
- [sighs]
- [pounding]

08:28.642 --> 08:30.210
Hey, babe.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.612
Hey.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.914
Damn. Guess somebody
was waiting up for me.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.952
Actually, um--

08:38.986 --> 08:40.754
It's getting kind of late,

08:40.788 --> 08:43.823
and Lauren and I
have to get up early
for the--

08:43.857 --> 08:45.292
So let her drive.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.160
Christ knows she's not
having fun tonight.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
Hey! Lauren!

08:49.763 --> 08:52.800
Why don't you take a walk
and give us a little time?

08:52.833 --> 08:55.035
There's no way I'd
leave her alone with you.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.807
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

08:59.840 --> 09:03.543
No, Daniel,
I'm gonna go to sleep.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.979
Lauren: Hey.
Let her go.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.249
Are you kidding?
I drive four hours
to be here with you.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.283
- I'm sorry, Daniel.
- Stop it!

09:10.317 --> 09:11.719
Sorry?

09:11.752 --> 09:12.853
[grunting]

09:13.654 --> 09:14.688

09:15.723 --> 09:17.891

- Ahh!

09:17.925 --> 09:19.960
Stop! Lauren!

09:19.993 --> 09:21.294

09:32.039 --> 09:34.808
Man: Yes, ma'am.
Protection first.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.210
Woman: Okay.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.912
- Man: That was the opening.
- Woman: All right, thank you.

09:38.946 --> 09:42.816
- Woman: Thank you so much.
- Man: You're welcome.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.820
Woman: Lauren, wait.
I have to read this.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.823
Lauren: Mom,
what is that?

09:49.857 --> 09:52.325
Woman: Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

09:52.359 --> 09:56.730
They want me to
sign this form.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.666
[muttering]

09:59.967 --> 10:01.234
"Delinquency
waiver of rights."

10:01.268 --> 10:03.704
Why would we sign this?
Mom, come on.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.007
Just-- just--
just let me read it.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.710
If only your father
were here.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.345
You're divorced
for a reason.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.281
[sniffling]

10:16.316 --> 10:18.652
He says that it
shows the judge

10:18.686 --> 10:19.987
you're willing to comply.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.722
That you're sorry,

10:21.755 --> 10:23.757
and they won't
transfer the case
to adult court.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.325
But I'm not sorry.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.260
Lauren, Christ.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.863
I'm already missing
two days of work for this.

10:29.897 --> 10:33.400
Just-- [sighs]
Look, you're a
straight A student,

10:33.433 --> 10:36.336
you have no record.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.406
They're gonna give you
a slap on the wrist.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.944
Where's Emily?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.047
Well, I told you
she wouldn't come.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.916
- She's coming.
- No.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.787
[muttering]
Okay.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.355
[exhales]

10:55.388 --> 10:57.891
Guard: Ms. Pierce,
they're ready for you now.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.864
Mom.

11:03.897 --> 11:04.932
Shh.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.436
[handcuffs rattling]

11:09.469 --> 11:13.874
Bailiff: Lauren Pierce
appearing before the
honorable Judge Bodkin.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.942
Be seated.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.718
Lauren,
Miss Pierce.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.320
Am I correct in assuming
you've waived
legal representation?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.990
Um, yes, your honor,
we don't think there's
a need

11:30.023 --> 11:31.925
considering Lauren's
track record.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.827
Excellent. Yeah,
I've reviewed your case,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.462
and I'm inclined to agree.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.898
Aggravated assault
is something we take
very seriously here.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.000
Assault?
It was self-defense,
your honor.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.935
[gavel bangs]

11:41.969 --> 11:43.804
Young lady, uh,
in this court room

11:43.837 --> 11:46.740
you are to remain silent
unless addressed directly.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.008
I have a witness.
She'll tell you
the same thing--

11:48.041 --> 11:51.144
Ah-ah. Ah!
I said quiet.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.781
Bailiff, are there any
witnesses on the docket
for Miss Pierce?

11:53.814 --> 11:56.416
No, your honor.
No one's checked in.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.485
No one has come forward
to support your claim.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.487
What I have before me
are the facts.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.524
And the facts tell me
you put a boy in the hospital.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.926
So here's what's
going to happen.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.527
You will be remanded
to a detention center

12:07.560 --> 12:09.763
that specializes in helping
girls like yourself

12:09.797 --> 12:11.464
as an adjudicated delinquent

12:11.498 --> 12:13.834
until a proper hearing
can be arranged.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.436
I-- I-- I'm sorry,
but how long is that?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.038
- Indeterminate.
- Lauren: What?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.007
You can't just
send me away.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.109
- I didn't even get a chance
to defend myself.
- [gavel bangs]

12:22.142 --> 12:24.812
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you
to be quiet.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.014
Before we meet again,
Lauren,

12:27.047 --> 12:29.382
I'd suggest you
get that temper
under control.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.384
[gavel bangs]

12:31.418 --> 12:34.487
Bailiff,
please escort Miss Pierce
out of the courtroom.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.123
Mom, do something.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.125
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, Lauren.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.392
- Mom!
- No.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.095
[handcuffs rattling]

12:42.129 --> 12:44.164
Judge, this is a mistake.
I signed the paper.

12:46.900 --> 12:51.038
Bailiff, escort her
from the courtroom.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.074
**

13:51.264 --> 13:52.499
Man: Bob!

13:56.503 --> 13:57.938
[grunting]

14:00.908 --> 14:03.977
Damn, Bob.
When did the season start?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.214
Bob: Invasive species.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.481
Didn't need a season.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
Right, Rebecca?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.085
Ahh!

14:24.965 --> 14:27.500
[grunting]

14:27.534 --> 14:28.969
How far this time?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.504
Clark pulled her off
the bus to Montezuma.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.975
You know how I hate to
bother the sheriff.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.510
Yes, sir.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.513
Well, I hope you at least
took pictures this time.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.083
Move.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.018
[chains rattling]

14:50.357 --> 14:53.060
I'm gunnery sergeant
Robert Patrice.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.564
Let's get you
processed.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.533
Let's go.
Come on.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.002
Come on.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.674
Nancy.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.209
How'd you do?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.543
Your husband like
pig's feet?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.679
I can fix 'em
so he does.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.547
All right.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.017
- I'll throw in
a shoulder, too.
- Mm.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.285
And let's get, uh--

15:18.318 --> 15:20.053
Shauna Simmons.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.056
Cadet Simmons in uniform
and up to speed by lunch.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.592
All right.
Right this way.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.295
[door opens]

15:28.328 --> 15:30.998
Not you, Lauren.
Thought we'd talk
in my office.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.406
[sighs]

15:46.113 --> 15:48.982
Los Angeles. '84.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.952
It was almost
the gold but--

15:55.622 --> 15:58.191
I hear you're
junior champion.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.194
Now, I think some day
you could be an Olympian.

16:06.799 --> 16:11.338
You're-- You're aware of,
uh, the archer's paradox?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.240
When the arrow
first leaves
your bow string,

16:13.273 --> 16:15.308
and you've probably
seen it in slo-mo,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.210
it's not straight.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.079
The shaft bends
back and forth

16:19.112 --> 16:21.181
from the force of
being launched.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.051
It has to find its natural
resonating frequency

16:24.084 --> 16:25.418
with the air around it
before it can

16:25.452 --> 16:27.687
straighten out
and hit its mark.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.793
You're at the beginning
of your life.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.229
You've just been launched.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.631
You need a little time
to straighten out.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.767
And you will hit
the bull's eye.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.770
See, I believe
you are gifted.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.639
You have been
gifted to us.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.341
And I think
you'll look back
on your time here

16:48.375 --> 16:50.277
as a defining point
in that journey.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.253
When can I use
the phone?

17:00.287 --> 17:02.655
Well, phone privileges,
like everything at
Paradise Trails,

17:02.689 --> 17:03.790
must be earned.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.825
When?

17:05.858 --> 17:09.462
I don't know.
Uh, 30 days, typically.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.664
Thirty?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.266
How long am I here for?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.303
That's-- That's up to
the judge.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.038
Let's get you fitted.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.750
No jewelry.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.742
**

18:14.761 --> 18:15.862
[sniffling]

18:46.926 --> 18:49.128
[panting]

18:54.834 --> 18:57.170
Take it easy on her, man,
she's dying out there.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.805
That's the only way
they learn.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.241
Bob: Faster.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.276
Faster!

19:03.310 --> 19:05.312
[indistinct chatter]

19:26.466 --> 19:29.302
Hey. Lauren.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.339
This her?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.173
Well, move.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.583
So, how'd she look?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.452
Who?

19:45.485 --> 19:46.819
Rolinski.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.588
She says they
brought her back
with you.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.459
Dirty.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.330
So what'd you do?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.466
Stole something,
I guess.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.301
No one cares,
fat ass.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.569
I asked her.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.304
I was babysitting a girl
about your age,

20:04.337 --> 20:05.872
gave me crap about
her bed time.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.976
They never found her.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.379
Becky could kick your ass.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.315
- [scoffs]
- Shauna: What'd you do?

20:19.386 --> 20:22.989
To Mr. Busk
in pre-algebra.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.293
You flipped off
your math teacher?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.994
They sent you here
for that?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.563
Jessie took her friend's
brother's bike.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.299
No, I didn't.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.667
Why would I take
a boy's bike?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.269
[mouthing]

20:37.904 --> 20:39.572
Pulled over.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.609
Cousin stuffed his weed
in her seat.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.277
He was gonna take
the blame,

20:44.311 --> 20:47.614
but they didn't
let him testify.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.549
Hardened criminals.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.584
- Becky?
- Man: Sit down.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.255
Ugh.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.397
Not enough protein.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.698
[spitting]

21:05.732 --> 21:07.500
Eat.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.669
Or you can
lick up your puke
in the backyard.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.626
[grunts]
Watch it.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.962
Or your girlfriends
help you finish.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.573
What's his problem?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.375
You'd be a creep, too,
if Bob was your father.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.577
And your mom
abandoned you.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.679
Watching over a bunch of
jail bait you can't touch.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.313
[sniffs]

21:56.115 --> 21:57.984
What, you want some?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.020
Find my replacement
already?

22:01.053 --> 22:05.492
Lauren.
She said she could
kick your ass.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.959
Shit.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.661
Well, is it cool
if I sit here, Lauren?

22:08.695 --> 22:09.996
[scoffs]

22:14.434 --> 22:16.569
She doesn't look like
a burn out.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.105
Or a skank.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.773
What's she doing here?

22:20.807 --> 22:22.575
She won't say.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.544
Hm. Let me guess.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.780
Judge made mom
sign a paper?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.818
Remanded until
further notice.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.488
I remember that one.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.026
[whistle blows]

22:40.059 --> 22:41.394
Man: Let's go!

22:45.765 --> 22:48.000
I want to go back to court.
I have a witness.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.603
Better be related to
the judge, too.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.772
He can recommend you be
placed in state custody

22:52.805 --> 22:54.574
until you turn 21.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.577
If you give him cause,
like I did.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.080
Word of advice.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.750
Avoid the bus stop
in Raley.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.486
Sheriff's always
waiting there.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.055
Course, the ridge
is no better.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.723
Nothing but cliffs.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.660
I'm not like you.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.663
Mm. That's a shame.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.077
Man: What's wrong, Simmons?

23:31.110 --> 23:34.146
Huh? Did you think
we were gonna be
at lunch all day?

23:34.180 --> 23:35.582
Come on, let's go!

23:35.615 --> 23:38.050
I'm not supposed to be
exercising.

23:38.084 --> 23:42.522
Up. Up! Let's go.
Come on, come on.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.624
- Up, up, up!
- Hey.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.192
Hey, get back
in line, cadet.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.695
Jeff! Sergeant
wants to see you.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.229
- She needs help.
- What do you think
we're doing?

23:50.262 --> 23:51.731
Come on.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.800
Come on, up, up.
Let's get up.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.202
- Let's-- Come on, up! Up!
- [gasping]

23:56.235 --> 23:57.737
Come on, faker, up.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.539
Hey.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.741
Lauren: What kind of place
are you guys running here?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.142
Man: Shut it.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.178
Think Jeff's got it
under control

24:06.212 --> 24:07.647
if you want me
to stay, Bob.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.091
Bob: Years ago,
this was a camp.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.594
Parents used to send
their children here.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.930
To train with
a real live Olympian.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.799
You want to go home?

24:30.269 --> 24:32.772
I want to make sure
you learn something
before you do.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.588
Hit that,

24:48.621 --> 24:50.757
you can go.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.594
[chuckles]

24:54.627 --> 24:55.728
There's no sights.

24:55.762 --> 24:59.131
No.
There's no sights.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.233
You have to feel it.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.536
The strongest shoot
on instinct.

25:03.570 --> 25:06.939
You rely on sights,
you rely on something
outside of yourself.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.151
- [thud]
- Lauren: [groans]

25:19.185 --> 25:21.287
Instinct, Lauren,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.890
is very quiet.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.626
You can't hear it with
all this other noise.

25:26.659 --> 25:31.564
Anger. Pity.
These other girls.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.166
That's the wobble
drowning it out.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.770
When you drill that,
you won't need me anymore.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.538
That's when you can go.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.784
[chains rattling]

25:52.919 --> 25:54.987
I'm learning to
bow hunt myself.

25:55.021 --> 25:58.290
Maybe you can give me
a lesson sometime?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.826
There's quiet spots
all over this ridge.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.361
You wouldn't
come back alive.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.730
Cold water.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.239
[water running]

26:16.308 --> 26:18.310

26:19.245 --> 26:20.713

26:40.299 --> 26:42.301
[panting]

26:47.006 --> 26:50.009
**

27:18.838 --> 27:21.007
Bob: Judge, you know
I've never said that.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.743
Oh, judge, you know
I'm not lying.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.679
No, I'm just tired
of explaining.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.414
Why should this month's
be any better?

27:30.917 --> 27:32.284
The archer?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.920
No, look--

27:38.357 --> 27:40.927
[laughing]

27:40.960 --> 27:42.661
[door opens]

27:48.901 --> 27:51.037
[door closes]

28:05.852 --> 28:07.453
[whispering]
I need a minute.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.921
[whispering]
What?

28:08.955 --> 28:10.356
Without him watching.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.761
Why?

28:14.794 --> 28:15.828
[clears throat]

28:24.370 --> 28:25.704
I'm done.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.381
What's that?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.921
[sighs]
Permanent.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.155
Scrub it.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.391
Scrub it yourself.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.749
Again.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.064
[touch tones]

29:27.066 --> 29:28.968
[phone line ringing]

29:30.970 --> 29:32.404
Hello?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.906
Emily.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.974
Lauren?

29:37.076 --> 29:38.878
It's not really
a good time, Lauren.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.880
I don't have much time,
anyway.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.014
Where were you?

29:42.048 --> 29:43.916
- What?
- My court date.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.451
Did they not
let you check in?

29:48.554 --> 29:50.022
Emily.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.158
I'm not sure
I would have helped.

29:52.191 --> 29:56.095
What are you talking about?
Of course, you would.

29:56.128 --> 30:00.499
Emily,
I need you to tell them
that he hurt you.

30:00.532 --> 30:03.569
I hurt him first.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.971
What?

30:05.004 --> 30:08.975
It was a mistake,
Lauren.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.044
No. No, that's not true.
You know that's not.

30:12.078 --> 30:15.447
I'm with Daniel.
Okay?

30:15.481 --> 30:19.018
I mean...
I cheated on him, Lauren.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.553
I'm lucky he would even
take me back.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.455
I've already
hurt him so much.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.057
I'm in love with him.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.125
[gasping]
No!

30:38.304 --> 30:40.072
[rattling]

30:51.117 --> 30:54.586
Okay. I want to start
by apologizing.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.525
I think I gave you
the wrong impression.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.964
You think because
I consider you exceptional,

31:04.997 --> 31:07.199
we're going to make
exceptions for you.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.243
It was a mistake.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.114
What was a mistake,
Lauren?

31:26.552 --> 31:28.654
Everything.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.623
Now you just want to
go back before the mistake.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.262
Are you ready to
straighten out?

31:38.998 --> 31:40.032
Say it.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.037
I'm ready to
straighten out.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.575
Good.

31:51.643 --> 31:56.015
I spoke to the judge today
about your case.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.549
Now, we both agree

31:57.583 --> 31:59.585
there's no reason for
someone with your potential

31:59.618 --> 32:02.221
to take up scarce space here
long term.

32:02.254 --> 32:06.592
However, he was discouraged
by the report today,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.294
and has authorized
an extension.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.565
I think--

32:13.599 --> 32:15.134
I think one year
ought to be enough.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.674
[yelling]

32:22.708 --> 32:25.011
All right.
Michael, get her!

32:25.044 --> 32:26.979
Get off of him!
[grunting]

32:27.013 --> 32:28.647
[yelling]

32:28.680 --> 32:30.316
[grunting]

32:30.349 --> 32:31.583
[screaming]

32:31.617 --> 32:33.319
Bob: All right, Lauren,
two years!

32:33.352 --> 32:34.320
Two years.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.023
Ahh!

32:37.056 --> 32:39.225
[flies buzzing]

32:39.258 --> 32:41.160
[gagging]

32:45.731 --> 32:48.034
Told you I'm
running these twats
into the ground today.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.336
You gonna stand there and
tell me you're up for that?

32:50.369 --> 32:51.370
I just thought said
they were both--

32:51.403 --> 32:52.738
Just give me the key.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.406
You're gonna barf
before they do.

the other guy

55:10.775 --> 55:13.678
Rebecca: Let's camp here
for tonight.

55:13.711 --> 55:15.980
There's no way
we'll make it through
those cliffs in the dark.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.723
We'll head to the city
in the morning.

55:27.725 --> 55:30.495
Bob: Michael!

55:30.528 --> 55:32.597
Michael!

55:32.630 --> 55:34.565
Michael!

55:34.599 --> 55:36.567
- Son!
- Man, what the hell
happened?

55:36.601 --> 55:37.768
Why are you not with him?

55:37.802 --> 55:41.506
Oh, Michael said he
had it under control.

55:41.539 --> 55:42.607
Michael!

55:42.640 --> 55:43.708
Rebecca: When we
get down there,

55:43.741 --> 55:45.776
think your mom
will fight?

55:48.746 --> 55:52.049
I don't know,
she already signed
those stupid papers.

55:52.082 --> 55:54.084
Dad?

55:54.118 --> 55:56.654
I don't want his help,
anyway.

55:56.687 --> 55:57.722
Asshole?

55:59.690 --> 56:01.091
One of these?

56:01.125 --> 56:03.761
No, he never hit,
he just...

56:05.195 --> 56:07.097
did whatever he wanted.

56:07.131 --> 56:10.367
And she's the one
who felt bad about it.

56:11.636 --> 56:13.771
I never wanted to be
that pathetic.

56:18.042 --> 56:20.578
That why you
started shooting,
champ?

56:24.181 --> 56:25.182
No.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.655
I did it to meet girls.

56:33.458 --> 56:35.560
Okay.
[laughs]

56:38.696 --> 56:39.764
Weren't you supposed to be
with him?

56:39.797 --> 56:41.466
I'm sorry, Bob.

56:41.499 --> 56:43.834
- Michael!
- Michael!

56:43.868 --> 56:46.136
Son!

56:46.170 --> 56:48.606
Jeff: Michael!

56:48.639 --> 56:49.874
Bob: Michael!

56:52.743 --> 56:54.745
[grunting]
Dad!

56:54.779 --> 56:56.647
- Did you hear that?
- Michael: Dad!

56:56.681 --> 56:58.816
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Michael! Stop.

57:00.685 --> 57:03.554
Michael: Dad!
Down here!

57:03.588 --> 57:05.055
Michael!

57:05.089 --> 57:07.525
My mom's boyfriend

57:07.558 --> 57:11.562
bought this piece of shit
crotch rocket Suzuki.

57:14.665 --> 57:16.767
One day,
he dislocates her wrist.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.640
They go to the ER.

57:24.709 --> 57:27.211
I go to the garage.

57:27.244 --> 57:29.780
Cut the piece of shit's
brake cable.

57:29.814 --> 57:30.915
Jesus.

57:33.551 --> 57:36.120
He was in a school zone,
so he, like, barely wrecked.

57:38.823 --> 57:42.527
Judge said I didn't
demonstrate remorse.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.195
But I did.

57:45.229 --> 57:47.197
I should have slit the strap
on his helmet, too.

57:47.231 --> 57:49.734
[chuckling]

57:49.767 --> 57:52.503
Cut your mom some slack.

57:52.537 --> 57:55.205
There's not a manual for
being married to an asshole.

57:59.877 --> 58:03.247
Oh, shoot.
I almost forgot.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.882
[laughing]

58:10.154 --> 58:12.222
We are definitely
getting charged as adults.

58:12.256 --> 58:15.259
Come on.
There's no way that
this shit is kosher.

58:15.292 --> 58:16.761
This looks like drug money
or something.

58:21.932 --> 58:23.868
What is it?

58:33.243 --> 58:35.613
Wait a minute.

58:35.646 --> 58:38.215
Ahh. Damnit.

58:38.248 --> 58:39.684
[groaning]

58:44.655 --> 58:48.826
Look. March 31st.
The day I was arrested.

58:48.859 --> 58:51.796
But I didn't have my hearing
until a month later.

58:51.829 --> 58:55.800
We're assigned a bed
before we even have a trial.

58:56.934 --> 58:59.804
Check it out.
Those are the payments.

58:59.837 --> 59:01.739
From the state.

59:01.772 --> 59:04.174
One for each girl,
each bed.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.644
The state pays that
to keep us here?

59:06.677 --> 59:08.779
Give me the money,
I'll behave.

59:08.813 --> 59:11.982
But Bob can't
keep the beds filled
without the judge.

59:13.884 --> 59:15.319
What--
What do you mean gone?

59:15.352 --> 59:18.188
Hey, could you guys
give me a second?

59:18.222 --> 59:20.290
What, are you running
a freakin' daycare?

59:20.324 --> 59:22.259
Don't tell me how to
run my end.

59:22.292 --> 59:25.262
Obviously,
I have to tell you how
to run your end, Bob.

59:25.295 --> 59:26.931
I should have let
that place go under

59:26.964 --> 59:30.267
when you were still
pretending to play coach.

59:30.300 --> 59:32.670
How?

59:32.703 --> 59:35.873
Michael, he, uh--

59:35.906 --> 59:38.008
I-- I don't--
I don't know.

59:38.042 --> 59:40.945
My, you really managed
to raise him right.

59:40.978 --> 59:43.814
I stuck my damn neck
way out for you.

59:43.848 --> 59:46.216
I got you
full custody, Bob.

59:46.250 --> 59:48.919
This is a joke,
it's a sick joke.

59:48.953 --> 59:50.855
Just get me evidence.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.358
If they talk--

59:54.391 --> 59:55.893
Who gives a shit
if they talk?

59:55.926 --> 59:58.228
They're all liars
anyway, right?

59:58.262 --> 59:59.730
Just get me the ledger.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:05.369
[sighs]
Four years.

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:10.841
I've been here
four years, Lauren.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.745
And-- and Jessie.
And Megan.

We're gonna end them.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:37.334
Pop! It's getting
too dark to search.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.936
All I could find was
a water bottle

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.337
at the bottom of
the ridge.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.972
[chuckles]
I don't know.

01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:46.777
Maybe it's time to
call the sheriff.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:57.922
Dad, I'm--

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:03.761

I know I screwed this up.

a lot worse.

Michael?

Were they nice to you?

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.781
Did they smile at you?

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:25.415
Is that what they did?

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:27.952
You think that means
they like you?

You don't remember?

01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:43.968
Huh? Your mother?

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.405
She didn't want you.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.808
She didn't want this.

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:54.044
You think that she's not
laughing right now?

you let them
root around here
with their snouts.

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:05.422
And dig up.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:15.732
Get up.

You understand.

What?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.128
It's what we do.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.819
We'll cut through
this stream.

01:03:08.853 --> 01:03:10.154
The cliffs won't be
as steep there.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.522
That's gotta be Beaumont.

I don't care
what it's called.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:15.492
They'll be waiting.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.461
Find a phone,
call my mom.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.531
You don't know what
they'll do for this.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:26.570
Someone will listen.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:28.238
Someone cares.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.477
I won't let them hurt you.

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:37.047
Ever.

You're not
killing anyone.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:11.268
Could have drilled me
at the house.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.969
You didn't.

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:16.513
You know it, too.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:20.250
What's he taken
from you?

01:10:20.284 --> 01:10:22.852
You've hardly known
another person.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:25.322
Just a...

01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.492
- peephole to
keep you company.
- Shut the hell up!

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.560
What about your mother,
Michael?

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.597
What do you know about it?

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.899
Michael, I know.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.602
He drove her away.

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:42.272
She would have
protected you.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:44.941
Shielded you.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:47.877
She'd be proud of you.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:53.283
[panting] No, don't--
don't twist this.

01:10:53.317 --> 01:10:54.884
I choose.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.953
I chose to be with him.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.889
Don't blame her...

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.625
for something he did.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:02.959
Shut up.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.328
Shut-- Shut up.

01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:05.562
Shut up.
Shut up!

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:06.596

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.683
It's supposed to last
a full minute, Lauren.

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:28.284
So enjoy it.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.655
[groaning]

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:36.693
Where is it, Lauren?

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.462
[panting]

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:39.663
Give it to me, Lauren.

- [grunting]
- [screaming]

01:11:41.565 --> 01:11:43.933
- The ledger!
- [grunting]

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.404
Give me the god-- damn--

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.705
[gasping]

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.610

Shh, shh.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:37.387
[panting]

01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:38.622
You want the buckle,
Lauren?

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:40.624
- [grunting]
- Huh?

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.058
- [screaming]
- You want the buckle?

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.527
Please, please.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.728
Give it to me.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.996
- Please, please.
- Give it to me.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.465
Give it to me!

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:49.599
Okay!

01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:51.034
[panting]

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:53.770
You want it?

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:54.838
Yeah.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:57.373
[panting]
Give it to me--

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:04.681
[distant scream]

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:43.587
Bob: Michael!

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.688
Son!

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:50.827
Michael!

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:56.633
Michael!

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:00.804
Michael.

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:03.540
Michael.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.208
Okay. Okay.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:07.477
Don't move.
Don't move.

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:10.580
All right.
You are all right.

01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:12.682
You're all right.

01:14:12.716 --> 01:14:15.218
[sobbing]
You're okay.

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.153
[sobbing]
You're okay.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.688
I'm gonna
take care of her.

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:19.756
All right.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:24.694
Now, look,
you listen to me.
You stay right here.

01:14:24.728 --> 01:14:26.262
All right?
I'm gonna be right back.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.631
Okay?

01:14:29.265 --> 01:14:30.834
Lauren!

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.806
Come on out, Lauren!

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.582
Lauren!

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:49.619
I got her, Lauren.

01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:54.591
You're a coward.

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:56.225
You're weak.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:59.128
And you'll always
be weak.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:00.630
You want me to do it?

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.269
I'll do it.

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:08.638
[laughing]

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:10.774
Okay.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:53.182
Okay.

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:56.786
- [whimpering]
- It's okay.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.822
[panting]

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.593
Go. Go!

[grunting]

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:12.335
Bob: Now you might be
thinking--

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:15.772
- [grunting]
- I should have got
his shooting hand.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:19.609
But right now,
you're probably
thinking,

01:16:19.643 --> 01:16:20.810
what am I gonna do now?

01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:22.211

01:16:23.647 --> 01:16:25.314
Uncomfortable.

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:26.683
Isn't it?

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:27.951
Hm?

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.819
Please.

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:33.289
Please?
Please what?

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.825
Hm?

01:16:35.859 --> 01:16:38.728
I'll give you the ledger.

01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:40.730
Well, I don't really
give a shit

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:44.267
- about the ledger
at this point, Lauren.
- [screaming]

01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:49.372
I mean,
did you really think

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:50.874
you could just
leave him there?

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.676
[screaming]

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:55.278
Go!

[crying]

01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:09.759
- Stop!
- Now, what I like to do

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:12.829
is string the species up,
slit their throat,

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:15.364
and let them bleed out
like the pig that they are.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.670
- This is for Michael.
- [grunting]

01:17:20.704 --> 01:17:22.939
- You hear me, Lauren?
- [groaning]

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.044

You're next, Sam.

01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:38.321
Whoo.

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:41.324
Better check your sights
there, champ.

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.793
I mean, you might end up
doing my job for me.

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:47.964
Huh?

01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:57.373
You'll always need
my help, Lauren.
