WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:04.335
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
TAKES BATH-SHOWER-BATHS.

00:04.335 --> 00:07.238
THAT'S A BATH, THEN A SHOWER
TO WASH OFF THE BATH,

00:07.238 --> 00:09.110
AND THEN A FINAL CLEAN BATH,

00:09.110 --> 00:11.042
'CAUSE THAT'S NORMAL.
(chuckles)

00:11.042 --> 00:15.616
DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME,
MR. PEES WITH NO HANDS.

00:17.148 --> 00:18.119
WHERE THE HELL
DID SHE COME FROM?

00:18.119 --> 00:20.091
DUDE, IF YOU'RE GONNA
MARRY MY MOMMY,

00:20.091 --> 00:21.592
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:21.592 --> 00:24.525
(lowered voice)
SHE'S AN EAVESDROPPING NINJA.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.556
CHECK IT.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.198
WHENEVER YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT HER,

00:27.198 --> 00:30.201
SHE FINDS A WAY
TO GET CLOSER...

00:30.201 --> 00:33.334
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING...

00:33.334 --> 00:35.166
ABOUT HER--HEY, MOM.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.208
DON'T TALK BEHIND MY BACK.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.170
NINJA.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.113
BOO!
OH!

00:42.113 --> 00:48.179
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:48.179 --> 00:51.652
OH! YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED!

00:51.652 --> 00:53.384
IT'S SO ROMANTIC,

00:53.384 --> 00:57.128
LIKE THAT MOVIE "INCEPTION,"
WHEN LEO LOVES HIS WIFE SO MUCH,

00:57.128 --> 00:59.090
BUT THEN SHE GETS MAD
AND MOVES TO THAT WEIRD CITY

00:59.090 --> 01:02.062
WHERE THERE'S, LIKE, NO PEOPLE
AND EARTHQUAKES ALL THE TIME.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.136
THEN HE ENDS UP ON SNOW MOUNTAIN
AND FALLS IN LOVE WITH JUNO?

01:05.136 --> 01:06.167
AW, JELLY BEAN.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.139
YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT MOVIE
AT ALL, DID YA?

01:08.139 --> 01:11.672
NO, BUT I CRIED SO HARD
AT THE END.

01:11.672 --> 01:15.576
I WANT TO SEE "INCEPTION."
COME ON. NO SPOILERS.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.448
BUT YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING.

01:17.448 --> 01:19.180
WELL, I'M BUSY, DUDE.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.511
UNLESS YOU KNOW
THAT I'VE WATCHED IT,

01:20.511 --> 01:24.655
PLEASE, DON'T BLAB ON ABOUT ANY
GOOD MOVIES, TV SHOWS, OR BOOKS.

01:24.655 --> 01:26.157
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE BOOKS.

01:26.157 --> 01:29.520
HELLO, JULES. UH, WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOUR WEDDING?

01:29.520 --> 01:31.422
THANKS, TOM.

01:31.422 --> 01:33.664
I TOLD HIM TO POP UP
AND SAY THAT

01:33.664 --> 01:36.167
WHENEVER WE'VE GONE OFF
WEDDING TALK FOR TOO LONG.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.369
OKAY, SO I'VE GOT
TO PICK A DATE.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.201
WHAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.702
I'VE GOT TUESDAYS OFF.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.774
MID-WEEK WEDDING--
IT'S A LITTLE WHITE-TRASHY.

01:43.774 --> 01:45.776
I CRY LIKE A BABY
AT WEDDINGS.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.438
ANYBODY ELSE
GET EMOTIONAL?

01:47.438 --> 01:49.140
I GET SUPER EMOTIONAL...

01:49.140 --> 01:50.641
IN MY PANTS.

01:50.641 --> 01:52.112
YEAH, I'M SORRY, JULES,

01:52.112 --> 01:53.784
BUT WE WILL BE HAVING SEX
AT YOUR WEDDING.

01:53.784 --> 01:55.316
(gags) PRINCE CHARLES.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.518
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA SAY NOW
WHEN I WANT TO THROW UP.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.290
OKAY, SO WE GOT
A TUESDAY WEDDING--

01:59.290 --> 02:01.152
WAIT. IT HAS TO BE
IN THE SPRING.

02:01.152 --> 02:04.395
IT'S WHEN I GET MY ANKLE
MONITORING BRACELET OFF. WHABAM!

02:04.395 --> 02:06.126
TUESDAY SPRING WEDDING...

02:06.126 --> 02:09.760
AND WE NEED SOME KIND OF PRIVATE
BANG ROOM FOR ELLIE AND ANDY.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.202
THANKS.
SO SWEET.

02:11.202 --> 02:14.435
UH, IT'S MY WEDDING, TOO.
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT?

02:14.435 --> 02:15.806
(all laugh)

02:15.806 --> 02:17.308
(speaks indistinctly)

02:17.308 --> 02:19.510
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

02:19.510 --> 02:23.274
I GOT THOSE GUYS
THE BEST ENGAGEMENT GIFT.

02:23.274 --> 02:24.245
IT'S A GIANT
PORTRAIT OF THEM,

02:24.245 --> 02:26.777
BUT IT'S MADE ENTIRELY
OF CHOCOLATE.

02:26.777 --> 02:28.579
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE WAY HOTTER
AS A BLACK COUPLE.

02:28.579 --> 02:29.650
MOST PEOPLE ARE.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.781
TRUTH.

02:30.781 --> 02:32.523
YOU KNOW, I HAD A HARD TIME
FINDING A GIFT,

02:32.523 --> 02:34.785
BECAUSE I WANT TO LET MY EX-WIFE
AND MY GOOD FRIEND KNOW

02:34.785 --> 02:38.329
THAT I'M COOL WITH THEM
GETTING HITCHED. AND GUESS WHAT?

02:38.329 --> 02:40.291
CRUSHED IT.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.793
LET'S SAY JULES NEEDS TO GET TO
GRAYSON'S HOUSE, LIKE, PRONTO.

02:42.793 --> 02:44.495
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

02:44.495 --> 02:45.936
SHE WALKS OVER.

02:45.936 --> 02:47.498
YOU WALK
TO SOMETHING YOU LIKE,

02:47.498 --> 02:50.341
BUT WHEN IT'S LOVE,
YOU GOTTA FLY.

02:50.341 --> 02:52.243
WHOO!

02:52.243 --> 02:55.446
WHOO-HOO!

02:55.446 --> 02:58.249
TOO MUCH SPEED! (grunts)
OOH.

02:58.249 --> 03:02.483
(chanting)
BOBBY, BOBBY, BOBBY...

03:02.483 --> 03:04.184
(Bobby and Laurie)
BOBBY, BOBBY.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
ANDY? YOU'RE NOT CHANTING.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.359
IT'S A METAPHOR.
I CONNECTED THEIR HOUSES.

03:08.359 --> 03:09.560
I MEAN, WHAT'S A BETTER WAY

03:09.560 --> 03:11.562
OF TELLING 'EM
I'M COOL WITH EVERYTHING?

03:11.562 --> 03:13.364
HOW ABOUT JUST TELL THEM?

03:13.364 --> 03:14.525
WELL, THAT'S DUMB.

03:14.525 --> 03:15.726
HE'S RIGHT.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.398
IF YOU SAY SOMETHING
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

03:17.398 --> 03:19.270
IT MEANS THAT IT SO DOES.

03:19.270 --> 03:21.402
IT'S LIKE THE GUY I HOOKED UP
WITH ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.903
WHEN I SAID,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.235
"RICKY, I DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'RE WAY SHORTER THAN ME,"

03:24.235 --> 03:26.337
WHAT I REALLY MEANT WAS,
"LOSE MY NUMBER, FRODO."

03:26.337 --> 03:27.408
(laughs)

03:27.408 --> 03:28.609
WAS HE SHORTER THAN ME?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.780
OH, YEAH.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.282
GROSS.

03:31.282 --> 03:34.915
(gasps) OH, NO. I FORGOT
TO PUT AWAY THE ICE CREAM!

03:40.391 --> 03:42.723
CAN'T SAY THAT I'M SHOCKED.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.626
(camera shutter clicking)
ANDY LET THE ICE CREAM MELT,
SO HE HAD TO DIE.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.428
IT'S ONLY PRETEND MURDER.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.530
WE USED TO FIGHT SO MUCH
ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.702
NOW WHENEVER I GET SO MAD
THAT I WANT TO KILL HIM,

03:51.702 --> 03:52.963
I JUST DO IT.

03:52.963 --> 03:54.805
IT'S BEEN A GREAT TOOL
IN OUR MARRIAGE.

03:54.805 --> 03:58.238
AND THEN ANSEL ADAMS HERE
TAKES PICTURES OF IT.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.340
YOU KNOW WHO ANSEL ADAMS IS?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.441
NO...

04:00.441 --> 04:03.544
BUT I CAN TELL BY YOUR TONE,
I USED HER NAME RIGHT.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.245
GO WASH UP
BEFORE STAN SEES YOU.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.349
THAT LITTLE SNITCH TELLS
HIS PSYCHIATRIST EVERYTHING.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.322
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO VISIT GRANDPA
BEFORE I HEAD BACK TO CAMPUS.

04:11.322 --> 04:12.423
OH, WAIT.

04:12.423 --> 04:13.724
IF YOU GO WITH HIM,

04:13.724 --> 04:16.427
YOU COULD ASK MY DAD
FOR PERMISSION TO MARRY ME.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.889
HE WOULD LOVE IT.
THANKS, BABE.

04:18.889 --> 04:22.363
YOU THINK SAYING, "THANKS, BABE"
MEANS THE CONVERSATION'S OVER?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.295
WHY IS HE STILL HERE?

04:24.295 --> 04:26.967
I DON'T KNOW. YOU ALREADY
"THANKS, BABE-D" HIM.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.968
RIGHT?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.300
(sighs)

04:29.300 --> 04:31.372
OH, NO, HE DI-N'T.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.373
YES, I DID.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.645
WILL YOU JUST DO IT
FOR ME, PLEASE?

04:34.645 --> 04:35.806
I WILL NOW.

04:35.806 --> 04:37.678
MM.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.312
(whispers) THANKS, BABE.

04:43.714 --> 04:47.888
ELLIE, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.060
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.862
ARE WE FINALLY
RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER?

04:51.862 --> 04:53.694
'CAUSE I KEEP A BAG
IN MY TRUCK.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.695
ME, TOO.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.667
AWESOME.
(clink)

04:56.667 --> 04:59.370
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND...
AND MY FUTURE WIFE.

04:59.370 --> 05:00.631
MM-HMM.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.333
WILL YOU BE MY MAID OF HONOR?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.474
OHH. COME HERE.

05:03.474 --> 05:04.475
(chuckles)

05:04.475 --> 05:07.438
OHH, AN ELLIE HUG--
SO RARE.

05:07.438 --> 05:10.010
OKAY. IT'S OVER.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.382
NO, NO. I STILL FEEL IT.

05:11.382 --> 05:13.914
I AM DEFINITELY NOT
BATH-SHOWER-BATHING TODAY.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.816
LAURIE
IS GONNA BE SO CRUSHED

05:15.816 --> 05:17.618
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
YOU PICKED ME.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.521
MAY I PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
BE THERE WHEN YOU TELL HER?

05:20.521 --> 05:21.692
SHE'S GONNA BE ALL...

05:21.692 --> 05:23.654
(imitates Laurie)
"JULES. IT'S NOT FAIR.

05:23.654 --> 05:27.998
I GREW UP IN A FOSTER HOME.
I HAVE AN ENLARGED HEART."

05:27.998 --> 05:30.100
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
SHE'S THE ONLY BRIDESMAID,

05:30.100 --> 05:33.864
PLUS I'M GONNA LET HER
HOLD ME LIKE A BABY IN THE POOL.

05:33.864 --> 05:35.105
I DON'T GET IT, EITHER,

05:35.105 --> 05:36.507
BUT SHE ASKS ME TO DO IT,
LIKE, TWICE A WEEK.

05:36.507 --> 05:38.839
WHO CARES
WHAT OLD FAT HEART WANTS?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.111
AND THIS MORNING,
ASKING EVERYBODY,

05:41.111 --> 05:43.774
"WHEN SHOULD I HAVE MY WEDDING?"
YOU'RE SUCH A PEOPLE-PLEASER.

05:43.774 --> 05:46.517
IT'S CALLED BEING NICE.
EVER HEARD OF IT?

05:46.517 --> 05:48.879
NICE.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.350
OH, YOU MADE THAT UP.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.822
(chuckles)

05:51.822 --> 05:54.525
IT'S YOUR WEDDING.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SELFISH.

05:54.525 --> 05:57.357
IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME
TO BE YOUR MAID OF HONOR,

05:57.357 --> 06:00.461
YOU HAVE TO STOP
PEOPLE-PLEASING. PROMISE.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.433
ALL RIGHT,
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.634
NO.
US HAPPY?

06:03.634 --> 06:05.135
NO.
ME HAPPY?

06:05.135 --> 06:06.467
RIGHT.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.538
THAT FEELS WEIRD.

06:09.099 --> 06:12.403
(Grayson sighs)
YOUR GRANDPA LIVES ON A RANCH?

06:12.403 --> 06:15.476
(Travis chuckles) YEAH.
HIS NAME IS CHICK.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.947
CALLS PEOPLE "PUDDIN'."

06:16.947 --> 06:19.780
HAS BOTH FORMAL
AND INFORMAL OVERALLS.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.151
TRAVIS.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.083
WHY'D YOU BRING CITY MOUSE?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.487
SIR, YOU KNOW
JULES AND I ARE ENGAGED,

06:26.487 --> 06:29.960
BUT I FORGOT TO ASK YOU--
MAY I HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND?
(snorts)

06:29.960 --> 06:31.862
WE'LL SEE.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.625
SADDLE UP.
(horse whinnies)

06:34.625 --> 06:36.467
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:36.467 --> 06:38.569
WHY DID I WEAR
MY SKINNY JEANS?

06:38.569 --> 06:39.730
YEAH,
IF YOU COULD SCOOT BACK,

06:39.730 --> 06:41.131
LIKE, EVEN AN INCH,
THAT'D BE SUPER.

06:41.131 --> 06:42.873
(sighs)

06:45.135 --> 06:47.478
OH, NO. THERE'S RICKY.

06:47.478 --> 06:48.609
KEEP MOVING,
YOU LITTLE SQUIRREL.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.110
YOU ALREADY CLIMBED
THIS TREE.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.744
ANYWAY, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MY WEDDING.

06:53.744 --> 06:54.885
YAY!

06:54.885 --> 06:56.987
OHH. THE WAITRESS
JUST GAVE HIM CRAYONS.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.619
(clatter)

06:58.619 --> 07:01.091
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOUR BRIDAL PARTY--

07:01.091 --> 07:02.422
LET ME TALK FIRST.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.894
ELLIE HAS TO BE
YOUR MAID OF HONOR.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.055
OKAY, YOU TALK FIRST.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.027
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.930
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HOLD YOU
IN A POOL LIKE A BABY--

07:09.930 --> 07:12.432
SO THAT FOR ONCE
I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
THE WAY THAT YOU'VE
ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF ME.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.936
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.469
DO YOU THINK THAT I SAY THINGS
JUST TO SAY THEM?

07:18.469 --> 07:19.610
NO.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.842
I KNOW THAT
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

07:21.842 --> 07:26.677
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE YOU
COULD HAVE TWO MAIDS OF HONOR?

07:26.677 --> 07:28.519
(whispers) OF COURSE.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.651
OH! YAY.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.553
SHOULD HAVE TALKED FIRST.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.555
NO, NO. NO, NOT NOW.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.556
COME ON.
JUST LET ME DO THIS.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.557
WE'RE NOT AT A POOL.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.588
OH, SHH.
BABIES DON'T TALK.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.089
BABIES DON'T TALK.
LAURIE, PLEASE.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.534
WELL, THAT ONE IS WHEN

07:43.534 --> 07:45.736
HE GOT HIS GROSS BACK HAIR
IN MY FACE SOAP.

07:45.736 --> 07:46.967
OOH.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
THAT ONE IS WHEN
HE FORGOT TO RENEW SATELLITE.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.871
I COULDN'T
LISTEN TO HOWARD.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.042
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COW HEART.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.545
YOU CAN BUY THEM
IN MEXICAN GROCERY STORES.

07:54.545 --> 07:55.876
I REMEMBER THAT.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.508
THAT'S WHEN HE TOUCHED
YOUR TURKEY NECK AND WENT...

07:57.508 --> 08:01.251
(imitates gobbling)

08:01.251 --> 08:02.513
(stops gobbling)

08:02.513 --> 08:04.154
SORRY.

08:04.154 --> 08:07.117
WELL, SINCE I'M ON A ROLL,
I WAS THINKING,

08:07.117 --> 08:10.090
MAYBE I COULD ASK LAURIE
TO BE MY CO-MAID OF HONOR.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.562
(hisses)

08:11.562 --> 08:12.793
DID YOU REALLY JUST HISS?

08:12.793 --> 08:13.864
I'M TRYING IT OUT.

08:13.864 --> 08:15.596
LOOK, IT WOULD
MAKE LAURIE SO HAPPY,

08:15.596 --> 08:17.127
AND IT WOULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY, TOO.

08:17.127 --> 08:19.600
BEING A MAID OF HONOR
IS A LOT OF WORK,

08:19.600 --> 08:20.731
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW ABOUT YOU,

08:20.731 --> 08:22.933
YOU HATE DOING THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.074
THAT'S TRUE.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.836
IF LAURIE WAS
MY CO-MAID OF HONOR,

08:25.836 --> 08:29.580
SHE COULD DO THE INVITATIONS
AND ALL THAT CRAPPY BUSYWORK,

08:29.580 --> 08:32.142
AND YOU COULD JUST SIT THERE
SOAKING IN THE GLORY.

08:32.142 --> 08:34.084
YOU PAINT A PRETTY PICTURE,

08:34.084 --> 08:37.988
YET THIS REEKS
OF PEOPLE-PLEASING.

08:37.988 --> 08:39.720
DID YOU ALREADY ASK LAURIE
TO BE YOUR CO-MAID

08:39.720 --> 08:41.722
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
COVERING YOUR TRACKS?

08:43.223 --> 08:45.155
WOW. THAT WAS
A LITTLE BIG, RIGHT?

08:45.155 --> 08:46.156
YEAH.

08:46.156 --> 08:48.258
NO. THIS JUST MAKES SENSE,

08:48.258 --> 08:50.561
PLUS YOU WILL ALWAYS
SECRETLY KNOW

08:50.561 --> 08:52.532
THAT YOU WERE
THE REAL MAID OF HONOR.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.264
I CAN'T WAIT
TO RUB IT IN HER FACE.

08:54.264 --> 08:55.666
SEE, THAT'S NOT "SECRETLY."

08:56.707 --> 08:58.709
YOU WANT US TO SPOT YOU?

08:58.709 --> 09:01.572
YEAH, BUT I'M WEARING A SKIRT
WITH NO GRUNDIES,

09:01.572 --> 09:02.913
SO DON'T LOOK UP!

09:04.244 --> 09:07.578
WHOO!

09:07.578 --> 09:09.319
WHOO-HOO!

09:09.319 --> 09:11.281
(thud)
OOH!

09:11.281 --> 09:13.183
MY GLASSES.

09:13.183 --> 09:14.725
EH, THE LANDING'S
A LITTLE ROUGH,

09:14.725 --> 09:15.826
BUT JULES IS GONNA LOVE IT.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.760
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.831
YEAH.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.193
JULES IS SKITTISH
ABOUT STUFF YOU BUILD

09:23.193 --> 09:26.266
EVER SINCE YOU TRIED TO KILL HER
WITH THOSE TUB SPEAKERS.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.569
WELL, I SAID SHE COULD
TAKE A BATH OR LISTEN TO MUSIC.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.671
YEAH.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.142
SHE'S NOT GONNA
LIKE THIS, BUDDY.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.775
I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT TRYING TO HURT YOU.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.307
YEAH, WELL, IT FEELS LIKE
MY HEART GOT KICKED IN THE NUTS.

09:37.307 --> 09:41.652
BOBBY, COME ON.
BOBBY, COME ON BACK.

09:41.652 --> 09:45.055
(sighs) THE BACK OF MY NECK
IS SORE FROM YOUR CHIN STUBBLE.

09:45.055 --> 09:48.719
MY ENTIRE CROTCH IS SWEATY FROM
YOUR BUTT HEAT, SO NOBODY WINS.

09:48.719 --> 09:50.821
HEY, CHICK, UM,
ABOUT THAT BLESSING--

09:50.821 --> 09:53.093
SORRY YOU BOYS
HAD TO RIDE DOUBLE DUDE,

09:53.093 --> 09:56.827
BUT MY ANNABELLE HERE
WAS JUST TOO SICK TO JOIN US.

09:56.827 --> 09:59.099
HOW YOU DOING, OLD GIRL?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.300
(sighs)

10:00.300 --> 10:01.802
YOU GOT SOMEPLACE TO BE?

10:01.802 --> 10:05.275
NO. JUST MY BAR, BUT I'M SURE
IT'S FINE WITHOUT ME.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.777
(beeping)

10:06.777 --> 10:08.709
(coughs) THEY'RE GONNA
TURN THAT OFF.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.111
TRYING TO MAKE SOME CURLY FRIES.
(clears throat)

10:11.111 --> 10:12.683
THERE'S JELLY BEAN.

10:12.683 --> 10:15.045
WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK HER
TO BE YOUR OTHER MAID OF HONOR

10:15.045 --> 10:17.287
WHILE I TRY TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE A MAI TAI?

10:17.287 --> 10:20.190
GREAT IDEA, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T ASKED HER YET.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.653
SHE'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

10:22.653 --> 10:23.654
ALL RIGHT.

10:23.654 --> 10:24.925
HERE WE GO.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.899
OH! THERE'S MY BRIDE-TO-BE.
OH, HONEY.

10:28.899 --> 10:31.702
YOU'RE POSITIVELY GLOWING.

10:31.702 --> 10:33.263
STOP. I'M JUST FLUSHED
FROM THE GREASE FIRE.

10:33.263 --> 10:35.105
OKAY.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.067
AS, UM, LISTEN--

10:37.067 --> 10:38.208
AS MY CO-MAID OF HONOR--

10:38.208 --> 10:39.710
OH, JUST SAY CO-MOH.

10:39.710 --> 10:43.013
IT'S A NEW ABBRIEVE
I CAME UP WITH--TOTAL T-SAVER.

10:43.013 --> 10:44.414
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

10:44.414 --> 10:47.417
(indistinct conversations)

10:47.417 --> 10:49.319
I MAY HAVE TO
CUT OFF MY BIG TOE.

10:49.319 --> 10:50.320
(gasps)

10:50.320 --> 10:52.082
I, UM, I GOT
ONE OF THOSE PEDICURES

10:52.082 --> 10:53.784
AT THAT CHEAP PLACE
THAT'S ALSO A DELI.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.726
OH, JULES!

10:56.827 --> 10:58.228
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY--

10:58.228 --> 10:59.760
MY TOE'S FEELING
A LITTLE BETTER NOW,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.432
SO I'M PROBABLY
JUST GONNA KEEP IT.
OKAY.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.164
YEAH. I MEAN,
I CAN EVEN JUMP STILL.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.766
COME ON. DO IT WITH ME.
IT'S REALLY FUN.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.838
OKAY. WHOO!
THAT IS FUN.

11:07.838 --> 11:09.299
SHE'S SO HAPPY.

11:09.299 --> 11:11.341
WHAT UP, CO-MOH?

11:11.341 --> 11:13.043
PRINCE CHARLES.

11:13.043 --> 11:14.775
J-BIRD!

11:14.775 --> 11:16.106
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

11:16.106 --> 11:19.049
YOU'RE GONNA FLY LIKE
THAT IRON MAN IN "IRON MAN."

11:19.049 --> 11:20.881
IS THAT A MOVIE?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.212
SPOILER!

11:22.212 --> 11:25.355
JUST COME ON UP HERE
SO I CAN PUSH YOU OFF THE ROOF.

11:25.355 --> 11:28.058
NO. WAIT, THAT ACTUALLY
IS NOT BIG ENOUGH.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.020
NO!

11:30.020 --> 11:33.894
WOULD YOU TAKE THIS THING DOWN
BEFORE SOMEONE DIES?

11:37.127 --> 11:39.970
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT. HAPPY?

11:39.970 --> 11:41.431
NO.

11:41.431 --> 11:44.905
WOULD A SUPER-SAD 2-MAN
ZIP LINE MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

11:47.077 --> 11:49.709
YOU KNOW,
SEEING YOU WITH HER

11:49.709 --> 11:52.212
REMINDS ME OF
HOW MUCH I LOVE JULES.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.785
SO MY DAUGHTER
IS LIKE A HORSE?

11:54.785 --> 11:57.717
NO! UNLESS THAT'S A GOOD THING?
CAN BE.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.050
UH, WELL, THEN, YES,
JULES IS LIKE A HORSE.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.451
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
WHEN I TELL HER YOU SAID THAT.

12:01.451 --> 12:02.452
PLEASE DON'T.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.124
(beep)
ALREADY DID.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.455
OKAY, BACK TO THAT BLESSING.

12:05.455 --> 12:07.497
SON, WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,

12:07.497 --> 12:10.730
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY,

12:10.730 --> 12:14.464
'CAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
YOU ANYMORE. YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:14.464 --> 12:15.465
YES, SIR.

12:15.465 --> 12:18.338
GOOD.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.340
SHOOT MY HORSE.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.371
WHAT?

12:21.371 --> 12:23.313
SHE'S HURTING.

12:23.313 --> 12:25.745
I CAN'T DO IT.
I LOVE HER TOO MUCH.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.517
AND TRAVIS IS JUST A BOY.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.479
IT DOES MAKE MORE SENSE
THAT--THAT YOU DO IT.

12:32.182 --> 12:33.323
THANKS, BABE.

12:36.857 --> 12:41.391
AW. GRAYSON SAID
I'M LIKE A HORSE.

12:41.391 --> 12:43.193
AW.
AW!

12:43.193 --> 12:44.865
ALL RIGHT.

12:44.865 --> 12:49.499
LET'S GET BACK TO DIVIDING UP
OUR MAID OF HONOR DUTIES.

12:49.499 --> 12:51.872
SO WHO'S GONNA BE HANDLING
THE BRIDAL SHOWER?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.173
YOU.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.404
WEDDING DAY MANI-PEDIS?

12:54.404 --> 12:56.046
YOU.
BACHELORETTE PARTY?

12:56.046 --> 12:57.277
YOU.
PARTY INVITES?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.809
YOU.
PARTY LOCATIONS?

12:58.809 --> 13:00.150
YOU.
AFTER-PARTY CLEAN-UP?

13:00.150 --> 13:01.451
YOU.
DECORATING THE CAR?

13:01.451 --> 13:03.783
YOU.
AND THE WEDDING TOAST?

13:05.515 --> 13:08.959
ELLIE. ELLIE'S GOT A JOB!
OH!

13:08.959 --> 13:11.962
OH, GOOD.
I HATE GIVING TOASTS.

13:11.962 --> 13:14.895
FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING!
WHAT-WHAT?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.797
JELLY, IF WE'RE GONNA BE
CO-MAIDS OF HONOR,

13:17.797 --> 13:18.829
THERE'S NO MORE
"WHAT-WHAT."

13:18.829 --> 13:20.070
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THEM.

13:20.070 --> 13:23.874
PLUS THEY TOTALLY TONE
YOUR UPPER ARMS. WHAT-WHAT?

13:23.874 --> 13:24.875
(high-pitched voice)
WHAT-WHAT?

13:24.875 --> 13:26.806
NO, I STILL HATE MYSELF.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.038
I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.911
YOU DO?

13:30.911 --> 13:31.912
IT'S CUTE.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.845
I'M GONNA
GO PUT MINE ON.

13:34.845 --> 13:36.586
UM, JULES?

13:36.586 --> 13:40.951
IT'S AMAZING THAT SHE'D GET
THOSE T-SHIRTS MADE SO QUICKLY,

13:40.951 --> 13:43.423
SEEING AS YOU ONLY ASKED HER
TO BE YOUR CO-MAID OF HONOR

13:43.423 --> 13:45.055
20 MINUTES AGO.

13:45.055 --> 13:46.897
WHAT?

13:46.897 --> 13:48.598
(creaking sound)

14:06.046 --> 14:08.348
LOOK AT YOU--
MY TWO MAIDS OF HONOR.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.479
(singsongy) CO-MOHS.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.282
NO, NO, HONEY. I'VE GOT
TIME FOR ALL THE WORDS.

14:12.282 --> 14:15.185
I AM SO GRATEFUL
THAT YOU BOTH LOVE ME...

14:15.185 --> 14:16.356
EVEN THOUGH

14:16.356 --> 14:19.329
SOMETIMES I DO STUPID,
TOTALLY FORGIVABLE THINGS.

14:19.329 --> 14:20.991
AW, LET'S HUG IT OUT.

14:20.991 --> 14:22.192
OH! YAY.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.864
OHH. YOU KNOW, HUGS...

14:24.864 --> 14:27.067
CAN FIX ANYTHING. MM.

14:27.067 --> 14:31.201
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO
SQUEEZE A LITTLE HARDER.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.403
(whispers)
YOU SMELL LIKE BETRAYAL.

14:33.403 --> 14:36.446
OKAY.
WELL, I AM OUT OF HERE.

14:36.446 --> 14:37.948
SEE YOU GUYS.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.379
(hisses)

14:39.379 --> 14:40.951
LOOK, ELLIE, WHAT DO YOU--

14:40.951 --> 14:42.452
(thud)

14:44.384 --> 14:46.957
(Bobby, singsongy) LADDER!

14:46.957 --> 14:48.518
MM.

14:48.518 --> 14:52.462
YOU SURE WE HAVE TO SHOOT HER?
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE'LL GET BETTER.

14:52.462 --> 14:54.564
SHE WON'T, SON. SHE'S DYING.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.528
(mouths words)

14:58.528 --> 15:00.400
(mouths words)

15:02.102 --> 15:03.934
HER EYES ARE SO HUMAN.

15:03.934 --> 15:08.038
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
THINK THAT HORSES HAVE SOULS.

15:08.038 --> 15:09.539
OH, ANNABELLE.

15:09.539 --> 15:10.440
GRAYSON, YOU'RE ACTING

15:10.440 --> 15:12.342
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
SHOT A HORSE BEFORE.

15:12.342 --> 15:14.544
I HAVEN'T.
KIND OF WEIRD.
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

15:14.544 --> 15:18.448
WHAT? NO, THAT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S VERY--THAT'S--IT'S NORMAL.

15:18.448 --> 15:21.451
WELL, JUST DRAW A LINE BETWEEN
THOSE TWO BIG, BEAUTIFUL EYES

15:21.451 --> 15:23.223
AND... (imitates gunshot)

15:23.223 --> 15:26.496
THAT'S IT. NO.
I'M NOT SHOOTING YOUR HORSE.

15:26.496 --> 15:29.559
AND I DON'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION. JULES IS 40...

15:29.559 --> 15:31.001
42? 43?

15:31.001 --> 15:32.062
NOT SURE.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.563
WELL, WE SHOULD
ALL KNOW THAT.

15:35.205 --> 15:39.369
(both chuckle)

15:39.369 --> 15:41.141
WORST GIFT EVER.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.544
I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO GIVE SOMEONE A METAPHOR.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.615
IF I JUST BELIEVED IN THIS

15:45.615 --> 15:47.177
THE WAY
I USUALLY BELIEVE IN YOU,

15:47.177 --> 15:49.479
JULES WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.453
WHERE THE HELL
YOU'D COME FROM?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.055
NINJA.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.956
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?
HOP ON. LET'S TAKE A ZIP.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.528
STILL NOT FEELING ZIPPY.

15:58.528 --> 16:00.090
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I WOULD LOVE?

16:00.090 --> 16:03.463
FOR LESS LADDERS
TO DROP FROM MY ROOF.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

16:05.465 --> 16:09.099
I HAVE TO SHARE THE ALTAR
WITH THAT BEADY-EYED BARTENDER,

16:09.099 --> 16:11.601
BUT VANILLA GORILLA
GETS TO BE THERE, TOO?

16:11.601 --> 16:14.574
WHEN I AGREED TO LET HER
BE MY CO-MAID OF HONOR,

16:14.574 --> 16:15.605
YOU SAID
YOU HADN'T ASKED HER YET,

16:15.605 --> 16:17.607
YOU BIG PEOPLE-PLEASING LIAR.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.349
I DIDN'T ASK HER.

16:19.349 --> 16:23.013
SHE ASKED ME, AND I AGREED.
THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.484
SEMANTICS.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.585
SPOILER?

16:25.585 --> 16:29.159
NOT A MOVIE. A WORD.
I WARNED YOU.

16:29.159 --> 16:33.493
I AM OUT AS MAID OF HONOR.
NO MO' CO-MOH.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.466
ELLIE, YOU'RE NOT OUT.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

16:36.466 --> 16:38.268
SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

16:38.268 --> 16:41.301
YOU'RE GONNA SUCK IT UP
AND START WORKING ON YOUR TOAST.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.672
THANKS, BABE.

16:42.672 --> 16:45.105
DID YOU JUST
"THANKS, BABE" ME?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.336
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.278
TH--TH--TH--TH--TH--TH--
THANKS, BABE.

16:48.278 --> 16:51.111
(both, high-pitched voices) OOH!

16:51.111 --> 16:52.142
FINE.

16:52.142 --> 16:53.583
I'M GONNA TELL LAURIE

16:53.583 --> 16:56.246
THAT YOU JUST MADE HER CO-MOH
OUT OF PITY.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.688
JELLY, DEAR? A WORD?

16:58.688 --> 17:00.550
ELLIE, NO.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.092
HAND ME THAT HANDLE, QUICK!

17:02.092 --> 17:03.593
OH, MY GOD! IT'S HAPPENING!

17:03.593 --> 17:06.126
GO, GO, GO!
(yells)

17:06.126 --> 17:07.427
WHOO!

17:07.427 --> 17:09.199
WHOO!

17:09.199 --> 17:11.101
LAURIE, START THE CAR!

17:11.101 --> 17:13.563
WHEN I DROP
INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT, GUN IT!

17:13.563 --> 17:14.704
AAH!

17:14.704 --> 17:17.637
(gasps) OH!

17:17.637 --> 17:18.568
(Andy) OH!
(Bobby) OOH!

17:18.568 --> 17:20.270
OH! OH!

17:20.270 --> 17:22.712
OH, OH, OH, OHH.
STOP. STOP.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.775
I-I CAN'T BREATHE. OW!
OH, OH, OHH. OHH.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.418
YOU'RE TALKING?
YOU CAN BREATHE.

17:28.418 --> 17:29.419
YOU DON'T KNOW.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.723
SO WHY ARE WE TORTURING
GRAYSON AGAIN?

17:33.723 --> 17:35.685
I'M COOL
IF THERE'S NO REASON.

17:35.685 --> 17:37.227
(chuckles)
(horse whinnies)

17:37.227 --> 17:40.090
YOU KNOW,
BOBBY COBB IS A GOOD MAN.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.661
YEAH, THAT'S USUALLY
WHAT PEOPLE SAY

17:41.661 --> 17:43.393
RIGHT BEFORE
THEY START SLAMMING HIM.

17:43.393 --> 17:47.267
HE'S A CRAP HUSBAND.
HE REALLY HURT YOUR MOM.

17:47.267 --> 17:52.142
I'M HER FATHER, IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT HER, AND I BLEW IT.

17:52.142 --> 17:53.573
I HAD TO MAKE SURE

17:53.573 --> 17:56.246
THAT GRAYSON WAS THE KIND OF MAN
THAT SHE DESERVES.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.578
BY SEEING
IF HE'D SHOOT A HORSE?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.681
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.754
WELL, THIS IS WAY,
WAY OFF THE RECORD, BUT, UH...

18:04.754 --> 18:09.419
GRAYSON'S ALL RIGHT.
MOM'S LUCKY.

18:09.419 --> 18:12.192
SHE IS. I CAN SEE THAT.

18:14.564 --> 18:15.825
IS THE GUN STILL IN THERE?
(horse whinnies)

18:15.825 --> 18:18.768
HEY! HEY! HEY! GRAYSON!
WAIT A MINUTE!

18:18.768 --> 18:20.300
OHH!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.172
I'LL GET ICE!
OH, OH, OH, OHH!

18:22.172 --> 18:23.573
OH.

18:23.573 --> 18:25.575
HONEY, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

18:25.575 --> 18:27.607
FOR, LIKE, THREE SECONDS,

18:27.607 --> 18:31.211
YOU LOOKED... SO... COOL.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.342
THAT'S GREAT.

18:32.342 --> 18:35.685
BE A DOLL AND GO UPSTAIRS
TO MY BATHROOM.

18:35.685 --> 18:38.848
THERE'S A BOTTLE
OF BIG, YELLOW PILLS.

18:38.848 --> 18:42.422
COULD YOU CRUSH UP, LIKE,
SIX OF 'EM IN A GLASS OF WINE?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.694
I LOVE THAT DRINK.

18:44.694 --> 18:48.198
HEY, JULES. WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR WEDDING?

18:48.198 --> 18:49.629
I'M BLEEDING INTERNALLY.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.800
GOTCHA.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.832
LOOK, I'LL GO
TAKE THE ZIP LINE DOWN.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.434
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.666
(Drive-By Truckers)
в™Є THE SUNSETS WE CAN CRY OVER в™Є

18:56.666 --> 18:57.737
BOBBY?

18:59.169 --> 19:00.510
YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE THING

19:00.510 --> 19:03.213
ABOUT YOU TRYING TO
CONNECT MY HOUSE TO GRAYSON'S...

19:03.213 --> 19:05.275
WAS REALLY SWEET.

19:05.275 --> 19:06.316
LIKE A...

19:06.316 --> 19:08.678
BEAUTIFUL METAPHOR?

19:08.678 --> 19:11.751
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY
ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.323
YOU'RE THE BEST.

19:13.323 --> 19:15.685
THANKS, J-BIRD.

19:15.685 --> 19:19.189
(footsteps recede)
в™Є EVERYBODY NEEDS
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE в™Є

19:19.189 --> 19:20.360
OH, GOOD.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.663
в™Є EVERYBODY NEEDS
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE в™Є

19:23.663 --> 19:25.765
STILL NEED THE ICE.

19:25.765 --> 19:30.400
ELLIE TORRES, I AM SO MAD AT YOU
THAT MY BUTT IS EVEN TWITCHING.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.901
LOOK.

19:33.703 --> 19:37.547
WELL, OF COURSE IT STOPS NOW,
BUT TOUCH IT. IT'LL START AGAIN.

19:37.547 --> 19:39.809
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY MAD AT ME?

19:39.809 --> 19:44.314
SO I'M A PEOPLE-PLEASER.
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT FLAWS, TOO.

19:44.314 --> 19:45.315
EH.

19:45.315 --> 19:46.656
YOU CAN BE MEAN.

19:46.656 --> 19:47.657
OH, YEAH.

19:47.657 --> 19:48.858
LIKE THAT TIME
THAT YOU MADE FUN OF ME

19:48.858 --> 19:50.860
FOR ACCIDENTALLY BUYING
LITTLE GIRLS' UNDERWEAR?

19:50.860 --> 19:53.563
I MEAN, WHY DO THEY EVEN
MAKE THONGS FOR KIDS?

19:53.563 --> 19:55.765
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A THONG
ON A 6-YEAR-OLD.

19:55.765 --> 19:56.826
MEAN.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.729
OH, I DID FEEL IT.
THAT IS WEIRD.

19:59.729 --> 20:00.730
RIGHT?

20:00.730 --> 20:01.971
YEAH.

20:01.971 --> 20:04.704
YOU SAID THAT MY WEDDING SHOULD
BE ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.278
WELL, MAKING MY FRIENDS HAPPY
IS WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

20:08.278 --> 20:09.839
THAT IS SO SAD.

20:09.839 --> 20:10.940
YOU DON'T SEEM TO MIND IT

20:10.940 --> 20:13.212
WHEN I GET YOUR FAVORITE COFFEE
EVEN THOUGH I HATE IT

20:13.212 --> 20:15.915
OR WHEN I ONLY BUY SWEATERS
THAT YOU WANT TO BORROW.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.889
I SAID PEOPLE-PLEASING
ANNOYS ME, NOT ELLIE-PLEASING.

20:19.889 --> 20:21.521
I LOVE THAT.

20:22.852 --> 20:23.953
I'M SORRY.

20:25.295 --> 20:27.727
MAGIC FIX-IT HUG?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.559
OHH.

20:29.559 --> 20:31.831
OOH. ALL BETTER.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.563
I'M STILL MAD.

20:33.563 --> 20:34.604
HOW MAD?

20:34.604 --> 20:35.765
MAD ENOUGH TO KILL YOU!

20:35.765 --> 20:36.766
HOW?

20:36.766 --> 20:37.767
CHAIN SAW.

20:37.767 --> 20:38.768
WHERE?

20:38.768 --> 20:39.869
BY A DUMPSTER.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.511
OH, LET'S DO IT.

20:41.511 --> 20:43.242
I LOVE YOU.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.744
LOVE YOU.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.916
SMILE.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.278
(motor revs)

20:48.278 --> 20:50.350
DIE!
(motor whirring)

20:50.350 --> 20:53.883
AAH!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.630
I ALMOST SHOT A HORSE TODAY.

21:00.630 --> 21:03.633
I FELL FROM THE SKY.
OH, COULD YOU POUR ME A GLASS?

21:03.633 --> 21:04.794
OF COURSE.

21:04.794 --> 21:05.995
THANKS, BABE.

21:07.737 --> 21:08.768
NO!

21:08.768 --> 21:11.040
THAT WAS
A SINCERE "THANKS, BABE,"

21:11.040 --> 21:14.474
'CAUSE I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
TODAY AND I LOVE YOU.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.606
AND NOW WE'RE OUT OF WINE.

21:16.606 --> 21:19.809
OH, I'M SORRY.
LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE MY GLASS,

21:19.809 --> 21:22.712
AND I'LL GO GET US
ANOTHER BOTTLE.

21:26.316 --> 21:29.889
THAT'S RIGHT, BUDDY.
GET USED TO IT.
(door opens and closes)
