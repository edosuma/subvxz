00:25.358 --> 00:27.223
Dad?

00:27.394 --> 00:29.191
Sweetheart?

00:29.362 --> 00:30.693
How are you feeling?

00:31.698 --> 00:34.030
Are you two still here?

00:34.200 --> 00:38.000
I think you need to go back.
Back home and get some rest.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.537
Hey, Clark.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.779
Don't worry about me, son.

00:47.947 --> 00:53.476
It's gonna take a whole lot more than
a heart attack to keep your old man down.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.380
I just feel like this is all my fault.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.319
Hey. Come here.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.438
Look, there's a lot of things
that you can do...

01:15.108 --> 01:17.576
...but causing cardiac arrest
is not one of them.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.514
Last time you were at the doctor's,
they said you had a heart of a 20-year-old...

01:25.685 --> 01:29.849
-...just before I went to Metropolis--
-lf you're suggesting your biological father--

01:30.023 --> 01:34.653
He gave you powers humans weren't meant
to have. Your heart can't handle it.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.092
Clark, no, there were other factors.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.992
If I hadn't put on that ring...

01:39.165 --> 01:43.192
...and abandoned you and Mom when you
needed me most, you wouldn't be lying here.

01:43.369 --> 01:46.361
As hard as this is for you
to believe...

01:46.806 --> 01:51.140
...not everything that goes wrong
in Smallville is Clark Kent's fault.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.477
Watch out!

02:33.386 --> 02:36.287
-Where are you going?
-They're gonna kill someone.

03:04.951 --> 03:08.546
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your reigning king of speed:

03:08.721 --> 03:11.087
Pete "The Boss" Ross!

04:26.866 --> 04:30.358
Whoa, Dante,
that's some serious green.

04:30.536 --> 04:34.700
All right, I jacked up the meteor-rock ratio
in this new batch of nitrous, okay?

04:35.341 --> 04:39.437
You ought to be working for NASA, man.
These cars are gonna be like rockets.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.409
Hey, Pete.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.742
Clark, what are you doing here?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.613
Hey, nice ride, man.

04:48.154 --> 04:51.214
What's that thing do, like,
0 to 60 in an hour?

04:52.258 --> 04:56.627
Hey, you ever wanna turn that tortoise
into a hare, give me a call.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.192
See you, bro.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.537
How's your dad?

05:08.007 --> 05:12.239
He's okay, but in case you didn't notice,
you almost obliterated our truck last night.

05:12.412 --> 05:16.178
-My mom was behind the wheel.
-I'm sorry if I scared your mom, Clark...

05:16.349 --> 05:20.046
...but, I swear, I was in complete control
the whole time.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.150
-At 1 00 miles an hour?
-You're not exactly one to talk...

05:23.323 --> 05:25.120
...about breaking the speed limit.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.522
You know what it's like to move so fast
that nothing can touch you.

05:28.695 --> 05:32.791
For me, this is as close as I can get.

05:38.938 --> 05:42.533
-How long have you been doing this?
-I don't know. Couple months.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.700
Why didn't you tell me about it?

05:44.877 --> 05:47.505
Because I knew you'd ground me
and take away my allowance.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.205
Pete, this isn't a joke.
You could really hurt someone.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.978
Clark, I know how to handle
these cars.

05:53.152 --> 05:56.212
Dante's the best driver.
He's taught me everything he knows.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.381
Including how to break the law.
Street racing is illegal.

05:59.559 --> 06:03.290
-You could go to jail.
-Not if no one finds out.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.761
You're good at keeping secrets, Clark.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.868
You're not gonna tell anybody. Right?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.702
They say everyone's got someone
that looks like him.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.338
Chad Nash doesn't just look like you.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.853
Karate team, orchestra, computer club.

06:29.021 --> 06:32.957
All things that you just happen
to be a master of?

06:33.393 --> 06:39.059
According to this article, you died
five months ago of a rare liver disease...

06:39.232 --> 06:42.429
...and suddenly you're standing in front
of me with a different name?

06:42.602 --> 06:44.160
-Who else has seen this?
-No one.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.567
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.100
Adam, tell me what's going on.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.936
Lana, you can't tell anyone.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.549
You have to promise me
you'll keep this a secret.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.922
Adam, your eye.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.452
It happens all the time.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.492
-It's just a broken capillary.
-Are you sure you're okay?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.430
It's nothing. I'm fine.

07:16.602 --> 07:21.096
Lana, listen, you have to promise me you're
not gonna tell anyone about this, okay?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.435
-Adam--
-My life could depend on it.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.067
Please, promise me
you won't say a word.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.005
So I've been following up
on our mysterious tenant in the Talon.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.636
It seems he has an intimate relationship
with needles.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.613
I take it you're not talking
about embroidery?

08:05.785 --> 08:08.015
Hardly.
I found a vial in his apartment...

08:08.187 --> 08:11.623
...and took it to the pathologist
at Smallville Med to have it analyzed.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.955
Well, what is it?

08:14.293 --> 08:18.889
It's a serum that contains minute amounts
of cells resembling blood platelets.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.898
Now, what's even freakier
is the molecular makeup...

08:22.068 --> 08:26.732
...is like nothing the pathologist
has ever seen in any human or animal.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.408
That's why I decided to take a peek
into Adam's medical records.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.581
Privacy laws don't seem
to faze you much, do they?

08:38.183 --> 08:40.583
Not when I'm worried about
one of my best friends.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.244
As long as Lana has The Talented
Mr. Ripley living above her...

08:43.422 --> 08:46.323
...I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure he's not dangerous.

08:46.492 --> 08:49.359
-ls he?
-I don't know.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.659
I know that when he was in the hospital,
he had a doctor visiting him twice a week.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.824
Well, that doesn't sound
very unusual to me.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.466
It is when it's not an M.D.

08:58.638 --> 09:03.575
Dr. Teng is a professor of molecular biology
at Metropolis University.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.872
-Have you been following up with him?
-"Him" is a her...

09:07.046 --> 09:11.779
...and she's so high up in the ivory tower
I'd need a ladder. That's why I came to you.

09:12.518 --> 09:17.751
A generous benefactor of the university will
have more luck than a high school student.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.755
Have you mentioned
any of this to Lana?

09:21.127 --> 09:24.722
I didn't wanna say anything
until I found out all the facts.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.228
Let's keep it that way.

09:49.221 --> 09:53.555
What are you doing? If I'd hit you, I'd have
totaled this car and it's not even mine.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.627
-Slow down, you wouldn't have a problem.
-When did you become a cop?

09:56.796 --> 10:00.732
Since you started racing kryptonite-fueled
cars that can break the sound barrier.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.731
-Don't I wish.
-Pete, listen to me.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.462
There have been a series
of fatal car accidents this year.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.936
They all had the same
kryptonite booster tanks.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.702
Clark, any car can be dangerous if you
don't know how to drive it.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.674
-But I do.
-That's not the point.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.279
Yes, it is.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.684
For once in my life, I finally found
something that I'm truly good at.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.184
What are you talking about?
You're good at a lot of things.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.186
-Like what?
-Like basketball. You got a killer jump shot.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.850
-You've beaten me plenty of times.
-Yeah, when you're not using your powers.

10:29.028 --> 10:33.727
Clark, I'm okay at hoops.
I'm a decent photographer.

10:33.899 --> 10:38.302
But you saw that crowd last night.
You heard them chanting my name...

10:38.471 --> 10:43.272
...and for once in my life, I finally get
to feel what you feel like every single day.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.205
I get to feel special.

10:49.315 --> 10:53.684
-Pete, I'm not special. I'm different.
-Clark, who do you think you're kidding?

10:53.853 --> 10:57.311
You can do things
that I can never even dream of.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.761
And ever since we were kids,
even before I knew your secret...

11:02.928 --> 11:05.453
-...I've been walking in your shadow.
-That's not true.

11:05.631 --> 11:09.624
Clark, don't get me wrong.
It's not a bad place to be.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.997
But I'm growing up.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.639
I'm realizing that
I got my own talents.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.469
Pete, I can't let you race anymore.
It's too dangerous.

11:17.643 --> 11:21.545
Clark, what are you gonna do,
physically stop me every time I go to race?

11:21.947 --> 11:23.938
If I have to!

11:31.223 --> 11:33.487
Fine, Clark, you win.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.886
I guess I'll just keep living
vicariously through you.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.645
-Doctor--
-It's rookie season--

11:58.384 --> 12:00.443
-Hey.
-You look like you're feeling better.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.315
Yeah. They need to give this room
to somebody really sick.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.287
-I got a farm to run.
-Everything's taken care of.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.656
You need to concentrate on feeling better
and your checkers strategy.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.662
-Not necessarily in that order.
-You've been here every night.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.300
Why don't you go out with your friends,
have some fun.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.062
Why would I go out
when I can beat my dad at checkers?

12:18.237 --> 12:21.934
I'm serious. Listen, just because I'm
stuck in here doesn't mean you need to be.

12:22.108 --> 12:25.600
Why don't you call Pete?
Go to the movies. I'll watch TV.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.178
Pete has other plans.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.807
You two all right?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.555
He's been hanging out
with a different crowd lately.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.228
Wait a minute.
When you say "different," you mean...

12:43.395 --> 12:45.192
...wrong?

12:46.699 --> 12:49.759
Without realizing it,
I think I've taken Pete for granted.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.795
Well, you and Pete have been friends
since the sandbox, son.

12:54.974 --> 12:59.911
Maybe he's just going through a phase.
As long as he's not getting into trouble...

13:00.079 --> 13:02.070
...give it some time.

13:15.427 --> 13:18.760
-How you feeling, Boss?
-Like I'm about to own the road.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.762
All right.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.563
Look, you're gonna
have to shift gears.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.968
-What do you mean?
-It's time to take a dive.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.405
No winning streak lasts forever, okay?
You're 6-0.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.913
That's the best driver this county's
seen since yours truly.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.176
Now, that means
all the money's on you.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.651
-So?
-So that's a lot of bucks if you lose.

13:44.824 --> 13:49.727
So all that stuff about the beauty of racing
and the triumph of victory, that was all lies?

13:49.895 --> 13:52.693
No, hell no.
I meant every word of that.

13:52.865 --> 13:56.392
This is the beauty of racing,
Dante style.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.332
See you at the finish line.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.141
This is for good luck.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.479
Not that you need it.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.054
Congratulations, Boss.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.556
Oh, thank you. Hey, Dante, look.
About that whole cheating thing...

15:27.726 --> 15:30.923
-...it's, like, I didn't have it in me.
-Yeah, it isn't in you?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.621
What do you think this is?
A little game of Hot Wheels?

15:33.799 --> 15:35.824
I'm out $20,000 because of you.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.299
-Sorry.
-Sorry's not gonna cut it.

15:40.906 --> 15:44.706
So you're gonna give me the keys to my car.
You're gonna pay me my 20 G's...

15:44.877 --> 15:47.607
...and I never wanna see
your face again.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.947
Dante, where am I gonna get $20,000?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.482
Oh, you're gonna figure it out.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.613
Because if you don't...

15:59.024 --> 16:02.653
...the only car you're gonna be
driving in is a hearse.

16:28.454 --> 16:33.482
-Hey, how's your dad?
-He'll be better once we get him home.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.524
Look, I gotta run.
His room's right around the corner.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.994
-He'll be happy to see you.
-Clark.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.227
Have you, by any chance, seen Adam?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.706
Is everything all right?

16:52.311 --> 16:55.371
I just hope your dad
likes the balloons.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.744
It was either these
or the "get well" teddy bear.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.350
He'll love them.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.723
I'm gonna go.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.923
Bye.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.404
Dr. Teng.

17:26.744 --> 17:31.944
If you'd bothered to read the sign, you'd
know my office hours don't begin until 5.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.210
I'm not a student, doctor.
I'm LeX Luthor.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.518
Am I supposed to be impressed?

17:40.392 --> 17:44.089
Even the chancellor makes an appointment
before he interrupts my work.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.161
I've heard you like to play doctor.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.865
Think I can get a checkup?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.567
I don't give physicals, Mr. Luthor.

17:55.741 --> 18:00.303
Nor do I see any patients.
I'm a research scientist.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.743
What about Adam Knight?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.411
Isn't he a patient?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.850
-I told you. I don't--
-I just don't understand...

18:10.022 --> 18:12.820
...why a world-renowned
molecular biologist...

18:12.991 --> 18:16.722
...would pay regular visits to a patient
in a small-town hospital.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.830
The amount of money your family
funnels into this university...

18:19.998 --> 18:23.798
...does not grant you the right
to storm in here and interrogate me.

18:23.969 --> 18:27.132
Now, if you'll eXcuse me,
I have work to do.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.575
Does that work happen to involve
blood platelets of unknown origin?

18:41.120 --> 18:44.146
I think you've seen one too many
sci-fi movies, Mr. Luthor.

18:44.323 --> 18:50.159
No. I've simply been fascinated with the
mysteries of hematology for some time.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.958
NeXt time, I'll be sure to call first.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.730
I wouldn't wanna interrupt
a moment of inspiration.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.757
From the way your dad's going off
about Kansas State's free throws...

19:20.926 --> 19:23.417
...I wouldn't know
he had a heart attack.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.392
It's nice of you to stop by, Pete.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.022
Clark, I've known your dad
almost as long as I've known my own.

19:29.201 --> 19:32.534
-How you holding up?
-lt was tough the first couple days...

19:32.704 --> 19:35.867
...but now that he's out of the woods,
I'm doing okay.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.874
Your dad's the strongest guy I know
beside you.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.103
He's gonna be fine.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.611
I better get going.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.978
Pete, are you okay?

19:50.155 --> 19:54.091
Clark, you got enough on your plate
without me adding to it.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.888
Pete!

20:00.098 --> 20:02.157
Don't worry about me.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.165
What's going on?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.161
Dante asked me to throw a race,
and I couldn't do it.

20:07.339 --> 20:11.708
Now he's threatening to kill me unless
I pay him the money that he lost in bets.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.445
How much is it?

20:15.080 --> 20:17.548
Twenty thousand dollars.

20:19.851 --> 20:22.513
Clark, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.722
All right, look.
You're just gonna lay low for now.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.192
I'll figure something out.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.160
So you think Dante's more
grand-theft auto than lndy 500, huh?

21:13.338 --> 21:18.071
Why else would he have a collection
of license plates with new registrations?

21:18.243 --> 21:23.271
Journalistic obsessions aside, it seems like
you have a vested interest in this story.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.212
You know how it is.
Once you start on a really good story...

21:26.385 --> 21:29.183
...you can't stop
until you get to the bottom.

21:32.391 --> 21:35.189
I just chatted with the motorheads
up in auto shop.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.023
Your source wouldn't happen to be
Pete "The Boss" Ross, would it?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.667
I understand protecting your source...

21:43.835 --> 21:48.932
...but we're talking about Pete risking his life
every time he goes for the checkered flag.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.667
Pete asked me to keep it secret.
I'm keeping my word.

21:51.843 --> 21:56.177
Yeah, but you of all people should know
that when your friend is being reckless...

21:56.348 --> 22:00.079
...sometimes keeping a secret hurts
more than it helps.

22:00.252 --> 22:04.154
He needs a friend.
Now, Pete might listen to me.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.215
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It's called sibling rivalry.

22:09.394 --> 22:11.157
You and Pete are practically brothers.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.627
Now, from what I've heard...

22:12.798 --> 22:16.290
...sometimes it's difficult to take
advice from your sibling.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.739
You were right about Jason Dante.
He could be the poster boy for LoJack.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.213
All of the VlN numbers you took down
are for stolen cars.

22:32.384 --> 22:36.286
That's all the evidence we need.
I'm gonna go talk to the sheriff.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.767
County sheriff!
Hands where I can see them!

22:51.937 --> 22:54.565
Drop that drill. Now!

23:03.448 --> 23:05.939
Good work, Mr. Kent.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.918
It only took eight deputies
and four cruisers...

23:10.088 --> 23:13.489
...to discover that that barn
was as clean as my grandma's pantry.

23:13.658 --> 23:15.216
But I saw those license plates.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.091
The only plates in that barn
were the ones in the kitchenette sink.

23:19.531 --> 23:23.524
And none of the cars in there had VlN
numbers similar to the ones you gave me.

23:23.702 --> 23:26.034
-Sheriff, that's impossible.
-As usual, Mr. Kent...

23:26.471 --> 23:30.032
...your information's about as accurate
as the local weatherman.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.301
But I'm cutting you some slack
this time...

23:32.477 --> 23:37.608
...because I've had my eye on Jason Dante
for a while now, and he is one slippery fish.

23:38.950 --> 23:43.011
Next time you say
there's a storm a-brewing, Mr. Kent...

23:43.188 --> 23:45.713
...I'd better see some rain.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.009
Pete?

24:14.386 --> 24:16.411
What happened to you?

24:17.489 --> 24:20.617
Dante thought I was the one
that called the sheriff.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.953
It was you.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.427
Dante knew about the raid,
because he's got a deputy in his pocket.

24:32.704 --> 24:35.264
That's why he never gets busted.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.911
-Let's get you inside and clean you up.
-Clark, I'll be fine.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.481
I just need you to get me
that $20,000.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.641
How am I gonna come up with
that much money?

24:47.953 --> 24:50.547
Go Kal on an ATM machine.

24:51.523 --> 24:54.048
-You've done it before.
-When I was on red kryptonite.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.717
-Then go slip on a ring.
-Pete, I can't do that.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.857
Clark, you don't get it.

25:01.566 --> 25:04.160
Dante's a psycho.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.804
He told me he's gonna kill
my parents first...

25:06.972 --> 25:10.305
...and then if I still don't pay up,
he's gonna come after me.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.439
Pete, you know I'd never let anything
happen to you or your family.

25:15.814 --> 25:19.511
-But it doesn't mean I need to break the law.
-That's never bothered you before.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.845
We've broken into so many buildings.

25:22.020 --> 25:26.423
-We were trying to help people--
-And now I'm the one that needs help. Me!

25:34.332 --> 25:37.927
Clark, if you beat him up,
he's just gonna come after us later.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.128
You're not gonna kill him,
and let's face it.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.103
You can't be on secret-service
detail forever.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.402
I gotta put an end to this.

25:52.083 --> 25:56.713
-There's gotta be another way.
-Clark! It's my family we're talking about.

26:01.159 --> 26:05.323
If you don't give me that cash,
we're dead.

26:15.540 --> 26:18.600
Clark, you just caught me.
I was on my way out to a meeting.

26:18.777 --> 26:21.974
-Did your dad get the DVD player?
-Thanks, Lex. That was nice of you.

26:22.147 --> 26:25.014
-He really enjoyed those Westerns.
-I figured he would.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.651
I hope he feels better soon.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.219
You've done so much already,
but I need a big favor.

26:30.388 --> 26:34.722
-Name it.
-I need $20,000 cash.

26:36.461 --> 26:40.261
You're right. That is big.
You mind telling me what it's for?

26:41.232 --> 26:45.601
My friend got mixed up with the wrong
crowd. Now they're making him pay for it.

26:46.504 --> 26:49.234
Is this the old proverbial friend
who happens to be you?

26:49.407 --> 26:53.400
Believe me, if that was the case,
it'd be a lot easier.

26:55.180 --> 26:59.981
Well, tell your friend that, in my experience,
money-hungry thugs are like stray dogs.

27:00.151 --> 27:04.281
You feed them once, they're at your
back door every night asking for more.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.953
LeX.

27:10.261 --> 27:14.595
Unfortunately, I don't think my friend has
a choice. They're threatening to kill him.

27:14.766 --> 27:16.461
Mr. Luthor, chopper's waiting.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.331
Be careful.

27:55.774 --> 27:58.607
Here's your $20,000.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.803
This car is worth
a lot more than that.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.006
-LeX gave it to you?
-Not eXactly.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.242
-You stole it?
-I plan on giving it back...

28:07.419 --> 28:10.081
...after you challenge Dante to a race
he can't say no to.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.588
-What are you talking about?
-lf he wins, the Porsche is his.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.851
If you win, your debt is settled.

28:16.995 --> 28:19.725
Whole problem is,
as fast as this thing moves...

28:19.898 --> 28:22.264
...it can't stand a chance
versus Dante's car.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.301
No, this is the prize.
You'll drive the car you always drive.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.303
-And you're gonna win.
-Well, I appreciate the confidence...

28:28.473 --> 28:30.031
...but Dante's never lost a race.

28:30.208 --> 28:34.872
He will this time, I guarantee it. I'm gonna
use my heat vision to fry his engine.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.412
I stay away from the kryptonite.
No one gets hurt.

28:37.582 --> 28:40.642
A last-minute tune-up.
Clark, you're awesome!

28:40.819 --> 28:42.548
I'm glad you're happy, Pete.

28:42.721 --> 28:47.215
Because I had to lie for you and steal
for you, and now I have to cheat for you.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.092
Let's get this done.

28:51.863 --> 28:54.229
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Boss.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.629
You got quite a pair of lug nuts
to take me on.

28:58.703 --> 29:01.228
Baby, take the Porsche
down to the starting line, okay?

29:01.406 --> 29:03.169
Okay.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.479
How do I know she's not gonna
drive off with it?

29:10.648 --> 29:12.582
I'll drive it down.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.879
Clark, keep an eye on the Mustang.

29:32.370 --> 29:35.828
-We ready to fly?
-Oh, yeah. This kid's for real.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.531
It's not such an easy win.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.837
-Did you put the package in the kid's car?
-Yeah, we're all set.

29:41.012 --> 29:45.449
Good. Once the speedometer hits 1 00,
the Boss'll be blown to bits.

29:47.986 --> 29:51.422
The race is off. You rigged his car.
There's a bomb in the engine.

29:53.358 --> 29:56.088
And who made you racing commissioner?

30:02.433 --> 30:04.492
Put him in the trunk.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.208
-Where's Clark?
-I thought he was out here.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.678
Let's stop stalling. Let's put it down.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.020
Pete.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.059
Pete.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.635
Good luck, Boss.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.107
Oh, my God. I think he's dead.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.699
I thought you didn't do house calls.

32:52.870 --> 32:56.328
Thanks to you, the university
is threatening to revoke my tenure.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.737
My funding has been cut off.

32:58.910 --> 33:02.277
I suppose those are the consequences
of conducting illicit drug trials...

33:02.447 --> 33:07.077
...without bothering to notify
your own university, let alone the FDA.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.285
You're lucky no federal charges
have been pressed...

33:11.456 --> 33:14.425
...but then again,
that could simply be a matter of time.

33:14.592 --> 33:18.028
What exactly is it that you want?

33:18.563 --> 33:21.031
I want you to do
what you do best, doctor.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.871
Biology.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.306
How do you suggest I do that? The
university won't even let me in the building.

33:32.477 --> 33:36.914
I'm gonna fund your research, doctor.
Consider your budget doubled.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.780
You'll have access
to whatever equipment you require...

33:41.953 --> 33:46.390
...as long as you tell me where the platelets
come from and what you're using them for.

34:29.132 --> 34:33.001
-Adam? Are you there?
-Be right out.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.570
Adam?

34:38.943 --> 34:40.739
Are you okay?

34:47.985 --> 34:49.885
I'm fine.

34:50.955 --> 34:52.547
Adam, I kept my word.

34:52.723 --> 34:55.487
I didn't tell anyone about Chad Nash.

34:55.659 --> 35:01.496
-But I think I deserve an eXplanation.
-Look, Lana. This is bigger than you realize.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.567
Whatever you know, just forget about it,
for your own good.

35:04.735 --> 35:07.067
No, Adam, I can't do that.

35:07.238 --> 35:11.004
If you're gonna live here,
you're going to have to be honest with me.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.538
You want the truth?

35:18.583 --> 35:21.711
I'll make it real clear to you.

35:21.886 --> 35:25.845
You tell anyone what you found out,
and you're gonna regret ever meeting me.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.216
Clark.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.376
-Hey, LeX.
-Hey.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.250
I was wondering what ever happened
with your friend.

35:59.423 --> 36:02.119
It turns out the dog's bark
is bigger than his bite.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.618
I had a feeling
you'd work it out, Clark.

36:06.697 --> 36:09.825
You know, the oddest thing
happened yesterday.

36:10.468 --> 36:16.464
After I talked to you, my silver Porsche
was seen speeding off the grounds.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.669
Someone stole it?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.604
Not eXactly.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.412
By the time I got in,
it was resting in my garage...

36:26.584 --> 36:28.211
...snug in its car cover.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.645
That's odd.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.882
- I'm glad you got it back.
-Yeah.

36:35.059 --> 36:39.393
My security thinks it was a joy rider,
but I'm not so sure.

36:41.265 --> 36:45.201
-Why? What do you think happened?
-I don't know.

36:46.103 --> 36:49.595
But I understand what it's like
to have a friend in need, Clark.

36:49.774 --> 36:53.232
Sometimes you have to cross the moral line
to come to their aid.

36:55.112 --> 36:58.240
Often that can be the test
of a true friendship.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.885
Give your dad my regards.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.911
The words "home sweet home"
have never been truer.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.107
-Come on, let's get your feet up.
-I don't need to put my feet up.

37:33.284 --> 37:37.186
They've been up for a week. The doctor said
that I need to rest. I'm not an invalid.

37:37.355 --> 37:40.153
Well, I'm gonna make some lunch.
I got you low-sodium turkey.

37:40.324 --> 37:43.657
-Low-sodium turkey?
-Jonathan.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.961
Sounds good, sweetheart.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.799
Clark, sit down.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.399
Listen, son.
It doesn't take a genius to realize...

37:55.573 --> 37:59.270
...that something's been bothering you
other than my health lately. What's up?

38:02.980 --> 38:06.472
While you were in the hospital,
Pete got himself into a bind.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.085
I did some things
I'm not too proud of.

38:10.855 --> 38:13.585
Well, your mother and l
trust your judgment.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.990
We did raise you to know the difference
between right and wrong.

38:18.596 --> 38:22.532
One day when we're not around anymore,
I'm sure that you're gonna remember it.

38:25.936 --> 38:29.531
Look, in the world,
things aren't always black and white.

38:29.707 --> 38:32.107
Sometimes you gotta wander out
into the gray areas...

38:32.276 --> 38:34.710
... and do what you think is best.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.440
What do you mean?

38:41.519 --> 38:43.953
Clark, I did go talk to Jor-El.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.420
And I think maybe
that is why my heart gave out.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.786
But listen, son...

38:50.094 --> 38:53.791
...I went into that cave knowing full well
that there were risks involved.

38:53.964 --> 38:56.091
I'd do it again if thought
you were in trouble.

38:56.267 --> 38:59.202
Dad, I promise I'll never put you
in that position again.

38:59.370 --> 39:02.464
Clark, that's not what this is about.

39:03.941 --> 39:06.068
You're different than
your mother and l.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.637
Son, you're gonna have to make
choices in your life, moral choices...

39:10.815 --> 39:13.113
...that she and I'll never
have to make.

39:14.151 --> 39:18.247
But we both know,
that when that time comes...

39:19.423 --> 39:22.256
...you'll do what you think is best.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.417
What's right.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.622
That's what's important.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.545
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.382
Clark, look, l....

39:55.760 --> 40:00.094
I know you're probably mad as hell at me,
and to be honest, I don't blame you.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.655
All I can say is I'm sorry.

40:05.002 --> 40:06.663
I am too, Pete.

40:06.837 --> 40:10.238
I had to steal from one friend
to help another...

40:10.674 --> 40:11.936
...and someone died.

40:14.111 --> 40:15.738
I know.

40:17.515 --> 40:20.973
If I had listened to you from the start,
none of this would've happened.

40:22.753 --> 40:26.587
Clark, listen, you told me your secret
because I'm your friend...

40:27.224 --> 40:29.556
...and at times,
that's not an easy thing to be.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.597
But it doesn't give me the right
to do what I did.

40:34.031 --> 40:36.226
I just wanna say that--

40:37.301 --> 40:40.702
Clark, I swear,
it will never happen again.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.838
Clark, I know I let you down.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.810
But I promise you
until the day that I die...

40:50.981 --> 40:54.280
...I will never disrespect
your powers again.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.824
You wanna play some hoops?

41:05.296 --> 41:10.996
-I was just about to go inside.
-Come on. Game of 21 by twos.

41:11.168 --> 41:14.194
Three-pointers outside of the crack.
No powers.

41:19.109 --> 41:21.043
Not today, Pete.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
