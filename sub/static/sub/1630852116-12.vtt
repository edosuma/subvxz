WEBVTT

02:00.120 --> 02:02.330
Invest in a venture fund?

02:02.413 --> 02:05.041
Who ever heard of a supervillain
making money off of interest?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.794
In a way,
it's the most obvious thing to do.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.711
What?

02:08.795 --> 02:11.673
He's desperate to build
a respectable appearance

02:11.756 --> 02:14.551
and justify his place in society.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.886
What do you want?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.557
I am Dr. Morgenstern.
This is Professor Reichenbach.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.519
We're here to see Mr. Matts about
a four-dimensional transport system

02:24.602 --> 02:27.105
that we're developing.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.485
You're temporal physics researchers?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.487
All right then.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.114
This way, please.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.829
Don't judge me by
my muscular frame and intimidating looks.

02:42.912 --> 02:47.041
I may not look it, but I'm a graduate of
the famous Princeton University.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.669
I'm actually an uncommon genius.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.631
Can you believe the way
that lecher is staring at me?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.426
I'd like to fry his brains
and turn him into a basket case.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.929
They've got sensors here.
Don't you dare use your powers.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.224
Ignore him and just think about
all the money you'll be getting.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.435
Who are they?

03:05.518 --> 03:08.897
A couple of scientists.
They've got an appointment.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.025
You've got 20 minutes to make your pitch.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.743
A time machine?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.162
That sounds expensive.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.623
Initially, it would cost
one hundred million dollars,

03:26.706 --> 03:30.835
plus a projected two billion dollars
over the next ten years.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.337
Of course,

03:32.420 --> 03:36.424
once the device is complete and you have
free access to all of time and space,

03:36.507 --> 03:39.469
we believe you'll easily recuperate
the meager investment.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.306
If you invest in this prototype,
you're sure to become

03:43.389 --> 03:46.643
the greatest supervillain
since the dawn of history.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.186
Professor.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.441
I hate to tell you this, but I already am

03:54.025 --> 03:55.944
the greatest.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.320
Your time is up.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.072
One last thing.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.741
May I use your restroom?

04:02.283 --> 04:03.701
For number two, that is.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.672
Do you paint pictures?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.510
When I'm in the mood.

04:21.135 --> 04:26.015
I like the sight of youngsters
dedicating themselves to new research.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.768
But you're 20 years too late.

04:28.851 --> 04:34.023
Your enthusiasm for four-dimensional crime
does me no good.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.861
The whole reason I retired
was because I lost my hunger.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.825
Currently,
I desire more refined pleasures.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.622
But how is an investment in art
not a type of hunger?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.834
This is not an investment.

04:52.917 --> 04:57.797
It is a method for expressing sensitivity
that defies time and space.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.466
For example, this work.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.510
A Mondrian, right?

05:02.593 --> 05:05.138
-Yes--
-That was quite a bowel movement!

05:05.805 --> 05:06.764
Pardon me.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.975
It's by Piet Mondrian.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.396
This lost masterpiece
is by a pioneer of abstract art.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.691
It is truly unsurpassable.

05:16.774 --> 05:20.737
It is the ultimate in beauty
and impossible to replicate.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.113
Can you understand it?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.366
Is that made of plastic tape?

05:26.117 --> 05:29.037
It is a well-balanced,
objective expression of New York

05:29.120 --> 05:31.289
created with a variety
of colors and techniques.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.833
You can sense the rhythm of the city.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.460
Yes.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.838
The joy he felt in moving
from Europe to the US.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.382
is expressed in the diverse techniques.

05:41.466 --> 05:46.888
One can also sense the early signs of
the movement from abstract to pop art.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.021
Magnificent.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.441
It was his way of
paying tribute to capitalism.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.320
I was deeply impressed by that variation.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.905
In addition,

06:03.988 --> 06:08.493
unlike him, I have moved
from the US to Japan.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.369
That is because

06:10.953 --> 06:16.542
that country has neither a past
nor a future that requires rewriting.

06:17.126 --> 06:21.964
Therefore, unfortunately,
I do not require a time machine.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.010
Matts, your Middle Eastern guests
will be here soon.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.053
Right.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.680
Our meeting is over.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.101
Why don't you try giving
your pitch to Salamander?

06:33.184 --> 06:34.936
He's an ambitious one.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.396
I'm sure he'll be interested.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.191
I had an enjoyable time,

06:40.274 --> 06:42.860
Dr. Morgenstern.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.822
Thank you for your time.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.832
What is that way over there?

06:55.915 --> 06:56.999
That?

06:57.083 --> 07:00.503
It's the temple with the cave
that Mr. Matts usually meditates in.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.463
He meditates in a temple?

07:03.005 --> 07:04.590
That sounds like what a retiree would do.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.260
If you're interested, I'll take you there.

07:07.343 --> 07:11.472
At night, a deserted temple
is quite thrilling.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.724
That made me really tense.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.018
All right, shall we get going, Professor?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.444
This place is phenomenal.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.320
I bet you wanna have some fun.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.156
Hardly.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.159
When I think about how
we'll be getting all this,

07:31.242 --> 07:32.660
it sets my heart pounding.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.746
That's for sure.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.209
I didn't know there was
a place like this on a Japanese island.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.210
Yeah.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.588
The laws changed a few years ago.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.299
I can see why Matts chose this spot.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.177
Okay, time to try my luck.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.888
Close.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.264
That's what you'd think.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.016
But using this--

07:55.099 --> 07:56.100
Don't do it.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.810
They've got superpower sensors.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.741
Mr. Matts,

08:11.824 --> 08:15.828
the guests from the Middle East
are enjoying themselves in the VIP Room.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.595
You really are the best, honey!

08:33.221 --> 08:34.597
In a mere 20 minutes,

08:34.680 --> 08:37.016
you got enough info from the memories of

08:37.099 --> 08:40.019
the head of security
to reconstruct that guy's entire mansion.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.189
Don't you forget my contribution, pal!

08:43.272 --> 08:46.400
My huge dump was what
bought her the time to do it.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.444
You bet I appreciate it, my brother!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.071
That was a hell of a bowel movement!

08:50.696 --> 08:54.492
How'd you do it without being detected
by the superpower sensors inside?

08:54.575 --> 08:55.785
It was easy.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.664
If I read someone's mind by touching them,
the sensors can't detect it.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.707
What? Touching?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.167
Who touched you? Where?

09:03.251 --> 09:06.003
Were you able to do
the research you needed too, Carmine?

09:06.504 --> 09:07.380
Yes.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.634
The main floor has only your standard
superpower sensors and security.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.553
To prevent against swindlers?

09:13.636 --> 09:17.139
The problem is the underground rooms
connected to the VIP Room at the back.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.100
That was a great bath!

09:19.183 --> 09:20.601
You guys are late!

09:20.685 --> 09:23.271
I can't help it.
There are six different baths here.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.357
Of course we're gonna try them all.
Isn't that right, hero?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.028
All right, let's get started again.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.323
Our target is the vault
on the very lowest level.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.326
We're after his briefcase
that's inside it.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.205
Just a single briefcase? I thought
we were fleecing him of all he's got.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.499
Do you know what a space-case is?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.460
It looks like an ordinary briefcase,

09:46.544 --> 09:48.004
but it's a four-dimensional briefcase

09:48.087 --> 09:51.132
with storage space equal to
an entire warehouse inside.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.135
A treasure
the size of an entire warehouseâ€¦

09:54.218 --> 09:56.721
-I like it!
-And it's easy to carry.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.807
And duty-free
if it's not discovered at the airport.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.227
I can see exactly why
he decided to move here.

10:03.311 --> 10:08.190
The problem is the hellish traps
that await us in the underground areas.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.651
This one will probably be
the biggest pain.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.361
The superpower sensors, right?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.113
Not just those.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.824
These devices can negate our powers.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.868
Seriously? What is this? Supermax?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.286
That's right.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.996
They're basically the same as that.

10:22.079 --> 10:26.042
But this is an improved version
that Matts funded.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.796
He illegally obtained the Supermax system
and enhanced it here in Japan.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.048
Hold on here!

10:32.131 --> 10:36.093
If this security system is similar
to the Supermax restraint vests,

10:36.177 --> 10:39.013
then it's also like that device
I was put in on the plane in Florida.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.640
Better believe it.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.684
Those restraint vests
that negate even the strongest powers

10:43.768 --> 10:46.520
require control equipment
with tremendous output.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.941
Supermax had that
and that airplane did too.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.612
Which means there's also one
in Matts's mansion.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.281
Normally, it's off.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.410
But if the sensors pick up the use
of superpowers inside, it powers up.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.123
It can also be switched on manually
from where the device is located.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.208
Seriously?

11:07.291 --> 11:10.336
So we have to turn off the entire system.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.671
What a pain.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.423
Let's avoid all that hassle
by using Ghost's power

11:14.507 --> 11:18.886
to slide in underground
outside the reach of the sensors.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.179
Yeah! That'll work!

11:20.262 --> 11:23.349
And if he goes right into the vault,
then we're totally good!

11:23.432 --> 11:24.934
-Impossible.
-How come?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.853
This is a special island.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.896
Look at this.

11:29.855 --> 11:34.735
Matts's mansion is built on an island
that's made of one enormous rock.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.280
The underground rooms
carved out of the granite are

11:38.364 --> 11:41.492
all connected to
the superpower suppression device.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.995
Like I said, if you enter them
underground from outside their range--

11:45.079 --> 11:47.623
The whole island
is made of a single stone.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.333
That in itself prohibits it.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.128
If I use my power
to enter a stone this huge,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.380
I could lose my bearings.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.926
Getting lost in the darkness of the stone
would mean my death.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.886
Oh, now I get it.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.847
Don't even try this.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.348
What's with you, hero?

12:04.432 --> 12:09.186
If your plan depends on using such
an unreliable power, then forget it.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.606
You're up against The Bastard,
so give it up now.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.607
Who asked you?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.318
It's not superpowers that we need here.

12:16.402 --> 12:21.323
What we need is a foolproof idea
for getting around the suppression system.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.033
Isn't that right, hero?

12:24.910 --> 12:29.373
I heard this from a guard I befriended
way back when I was in Supermax.

12:29.457 --> 12:33.085
Their system completely suppresses powers
throughout the whole facility,

12:33.794 --> 12:34.962
but it has a flaw.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.090
It has to be updated regularly
in order to register

12:38.174 --> 12:40.634
any new people with superpowers.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.636
To do so, it must be rebooted.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.348
Naturally, the backup system ordinarily
automatically kicks in then.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.810
But if the backup system
is destroyed at the same time,

12:49.894 --> 12:53.772
we can use our powers all we like
until it finishes rebooting.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.733
How long does it take to reboot?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.068
Probably about ten minutes.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.779
-I like it.
-That's plenty of time.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.533
If we only knew where the system was.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.744
It's here and here.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.747
There's a link to it
from Matts's office too.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.208
You're the greatest, baby!

13:12.291 --> 13:14.502
That should satisfy you, right, hero?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.255
All we need to get is a single briefcase.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.840
Excellent.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.510
Now let's work out
the details of the plan.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.888
First, we split into two groups
and enter the facility.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.519
Gather around for a second.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.648
I really do appreciate
that you're doing all this

13:35.731 --> 13:37.399
for little old me.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.193
Oh, Carmine.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.446
Don't talk like that.
We all owe it to you.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.866
I really am proud of all of you.

13:46.575 --> 13:50.412
This world only values
friendship among superheroes,

13:50.496 --> 13:54.542
but there is humanity
and fidelity among villains as well.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.336
Now, let us drink a toast. Cheers.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.629
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

14:03.884 --> 14:05.427
I wonder why

14:05.511 --> 14:09.306
Matts has made it so he can't even use
his own powers in his own mansion.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.311
I don't know,
but one thing that I can say is

14:14.395 --> 14:16.564
he despises superpowers,

14:16.647 --> 14:18.649
even his own.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.026
Everyone, over here!

14:21.110 --> 14:22.194
VoilÃ !

14:22.278 --> 14:23.362
What the heck is this?

14:23.445 --> 14:27.741
I prepared brilliant new outfits
for our utterly awesome plan.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.911
Whoa! You've got everything,
even boots and masks!

14:30.995 --> 14:32.830
-Those look pretty lame.
-I like 'em.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.583
There's also that metal whip
we got from underground wrestling.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.543
I'm not wearing that suit.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.253
Don't be like that.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.754
I think you'll look good in it.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.256
Or is it the color you don't like?

14:43.465 --> 14:44.925
Don't get smart with me.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.596
If you get too carried away,
you'll find my fist down your throat.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.347
Oh, you're such a pervert.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.620
It's just about time for you to go.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.915
So what did you want to see me here for?

15:16.624 --> 15:19.001
-Just listen. I've got a good story.
-I've got one too!

15:23.839 --> 15:24.840
Will you miss us?

15:25.466 --> 15:27.885
This is all
I promised to do from the start.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.013
All that's left is for me
to go to the airport tomorrow.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.098
-I see.
-That's right.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.603
Considering how you got that intel
and analyzed it, it's hard to believe

15:37.686 --> 15:39.772
you hadn't used
your powers for five years.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.440
You're really incredible.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.901
You've still got the knack,
don't you think?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.986
I've had enough.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.571
Butâ€¦

15:49.281 --> 15:54.495
I could never stand for Carmine
to fall victim to that Salamander bastard.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.038
Yeah.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.833
He's a very special person to me.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.254
You know,

16:04.338 --> 16:07.841
until now, I've done more stupid things
than I can even count.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.470
But what do you think
the stupidest thing I've ever done was?

16:13.472 --> 16:16.016
It was losing the finest woman around.

16:18.852 --> 16:22.106
I'm not just a villain, but a liar.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.694
But that message comes
straight from the heart.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.153
Message?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.863
What message?

16:30.447 --> 16:31.281
Look up.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.253
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.296
This will be the last time.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.715
I promise you.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.288
I can't deal with you anymore.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.999
Don't make me say it again, Johnny.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.002
The plan is way too reckless.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.588
I don't want to make
the same mistake again.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.759
I get it, but just listen to me!

17:32.426 --> 17:34.011
Wait! Honey?

17:36.388 --> 17:38.390
She's at the airport?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.308
Yeah.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.268
She's an adult.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.644
She'll be fine.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.105
Besides, it's time for us to go.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.067
The plan goes into action
at 1 p.m. on the dot.

17:48.692 --> 17:52.529
Until then,
don't accidentally use your powers.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.742
The update starts at 2 p.m.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.662
We'll split into teams
and infiltrate simultaneously.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.336
One will climb the ravine
and enter the facility via the jetty.

18:07.419 --> 18:12.966
You'll destroy the backup data
on the private server ahead of time.

18:13.550 --> 18:18.263
Then, Johnny, Forecast, McCabe, and I
will head for the mansion in a van.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.725
We'll infiltrate the security room
with the superpower suppression device,

18:21.809 --> 18:25.854
then short-circuit the system
and force it to update.

18:26.647 --> 18:31.443
The teams must remain in constant contact
as we conduct this plan.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.323
Did you kill them?

18:36.406 --> 18:38.992
Don't be ridiculous.
It's just a tranquilizer gun.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.077
Hey, look at this!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.579
I don't see Praetorian or Matts anywhere.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.581
We're in luck, hero.

18:56.969 --> 18:57.886
This'll be easy.

18:59.012 --> 18:59.847
Wait!

19:15.821 --> 19:17.906
What is this, a ninja house?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.575
You didn't tell us about this trap!

19:19.658 --> 19:21.285
Don't use your powers!

19:21.368 --> 19:23.287
We know that!

19:35.924 --> 19:37.259
What's that?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.761
They're armed like a military base.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.513
Talk about unsafe!

19:41.597 --> 19:42.723
Ghost!

19:45.517 --> 19:47.186
We'll be your decoys!

19:47.269 --> 19:48.729
Got it. Let's go, hero!

19:55.235 --> 19:56.945
What's wrong, Mr. Hero?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.497
How many more minutes?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.958
The backup
should be destroyed pretty soon.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.172
-What the hell is that?
-Holy shit!

20:15.255 --> 20:16.882
Look at that! Those guys are deadly!

20:17.466 --> 20:18.842
We don't have time for this!

20:24.056 --> 20:25.557
What? Seriously?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.851
I really can't use my power!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.104
Stand back!

20:31.188 --> 20:32.147
Watch out, man!

20:32.981 --> 20:34.107
Take this!

20:36.151 --> 20:37.653
Nice job, The Heat!

20:39.613 --> 20:41.573
What the hell is this?

20:41.657 --> 20:44.243
This lock wasn't in the briefing.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.036
Hey, my brother.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.746
I've unlocked two of them, butâ€¦

20:48.455 --> 20:50.499
What'll we do? We're running out of time.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.300
If timing is the key to survival,
then I'll just have to do it.

21:01.843 --> 21:02.761
Ghost!

21:03.929 --> 21:06.223
-You set off the alarm!
-I was ready for that!

21:09.101 --> 21:11.019
What's with this ninja squad?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.896
Hey, hero! Help out a little!

21:14.314 --> 21:16.233
Fine. I'll take care of this.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.611
Seriously?

21:19.695 --> 21:21.947
I can't use my power, my brother!

21:22.030 --> 21:23.907
How many of these creeps are there?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.785
Anyway, I ain't giving up--

21:28.203 --> 21:31.039
-My brother!
-Forget that! Tell me how to hack this!

21:31.123 --> 21:34.084
We're almost out of time
to destroy the backup data!

21:34.167 --> 21:35.252
Right!

21:35.836 --> 21:37.129
Plug this into it!

21:38.672 --> 21:39.506
This thing?

21:40.173 --> 21:42.259
Plug it in
and a virus will blow it to bits!

21:43.844 --> 21:44.886
Plug it--

21:46.221 --> 21:48.056
Hurry up and do it, Ghost!

21:54.271 --> 21:55.814
This better work.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.528
You think those guys destroyed it?

22:01.611 --> 22:04.489
If they didn't,
this mission would be over.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.325
We'll just have to trust them.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.911
Yep. Time to start the update.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.295
Hey, look! The backup isn't kicking in!

22:19.504 --> 22:23.300
Then that means,
we can use our powers all we like!

22:24.343 --> 22:25.552
Leave this to me!

22:26.261 --> 22:27.095
Now to finish them off.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.059
Let's keep moving!

22:42.986 --> 22:45.072
Looks like Johnny
and the others did it, hero.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.887
-I feel so alive!
-We're back!

23:08.970 --> 23:11.098
-How much more time?
-Nine minutes!

23:15.268 --> 23:19.022
So how much longer
is it going to be delayed?

23:19.106 --> 23:21.983
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.985
Please take a seat in the meantime.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.363
Don't be in such a rush.

23:27.614 --> 23:31.034
If you move a single muscle,
I'll burn you to death.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.329
I'll never forget your aura.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.164
What's wrong?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.875
Were you in such a rush,
you forgot to use your power?

23:39.835 --> 23:41.628
Oh, dear me.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.674
Don't ever take me for an idiot.

25:13.428 --> 25:18.433
