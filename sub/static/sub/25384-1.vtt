01:25.826 --> 01:29.694
Sing like no one is listening,
love like you'll never be hurt,

01:29.730 --> 01:34.466
dance like no one is watching,
live like it's heaven on earth.

01:34.501 --> 01:36.735
That's my very favourite saying,

01:36.770 --> 01:40.705
and nothing speaks truer
than that on your wedding day.

01:40.741 --> 01:42.874
What if I trip and fall
on my face, Hope?

01:42.910 --> 01:45.410
Then you will still live
happily ever after.

01:45.446 --> 01:47.846
And you'll have a great story
to tell your grandkids.

01:47.881 --> 01:51.082
None of my dance couples
have ever missed a step.

01:51.118 --> 01:52.184
You're good, Vivian.

01:52.219 --> 01:55.687
We've spent countless hours
in the studio together.

01:55.722 --> 01:57.155
You've got this.

01:57.191 --> 01:59.658
Now go get your husband,
married lady.

01:59.693 --> 02:01.293
Alright. Let's dance.

02:52.746 --> 02:55.547
And step.

02:55.582 --> 02:58.450
And turn.

02:58.485 --> 03:01.419
And step.

03:01.455 --> 03:04.556
And turn.

03:04.591 --> 03:07.425
And step.

03:07.461 --> 03:10.295
And turn.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.465
And step.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.635
And turn.

03:16.670 --> 03:19.137
And bourree.

03:19.172 --> 03:21.973
Bourree.

03:22.009 --> 03:23.808
And bourree.

03:32.719 --> 03:36.521
A lady always curtsies after
an exceptional performance.

03:37.858 --> 03:38.823
That was perfect.

03:38.859 --> 03:40.136
OK, now find your parents
but don't forget,

03:40.160 --> 03:41.459
practice, practice, practice.

03:41.495 --> 03:43.995
The wedding is only
a couple weeks away.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.733
Really good job out there.

03:50.470 --> 03:52.671
Great work, see ya next time.

03:52.706 --> 03:55.473
Well done.
You are so good with them.

03:55.509 --> 03:57.943
I know I'm leaving my studio
to the best of care.

03:57.978 --> 03:58.810
Well, it's not mine yet.

03:58.845 --> 04:00.445
I haven't been approved
for the loan.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.113
In any case, it'll all work out.

04:02.149 --> 04:04.193
'Cause that's what happens
when something's meant to be.

04:04.217 --> 04:05.784
It all works out.

04:09.556 --> 04:10.622
Who's getting married?

04:10.657 --> 04:12.958
Well, it is Saturday,
so probably a lot of people.

04:12.993 --> 04:15.026
I guess my invitation got lost
in the mail, huh?

04:16.329 --> 04:19.464
But this didn't.

04:19.499 --> 04:21.800
I know, I just found it
laying around outside.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.835
Is this what I think it is?

04:23.870 --> 04:27.539
Well, it's not a million dollars
if that's what you're thinking.

04:27.574 --> 04:29.874
Tickets to the opening
of "Love in Campbell Park".

04:29.910 --> 04:31.843
This is better than
a million dollars.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.912
Ticket.
I could only get you one.

04:33.947 --> 04:35.914
- Sorry.
- Are you crazy?

04:35.949 --> 04:36.815
I will stand for
the whole thing.

04:36.850 --> 04:37.994
This is the hottest ticket
on Broadway.

04:38.018 --> 04:39.250
Well, it's lucky you have

04:39.286 --> 04:40.430
some fancy connections then,
huh?

04:40.454 --> 04:42.887
- One fancy connection.
- Hey, that's all it takes.

04:42.923 --> 04:45.390
I can't believe I get to finally
watch you dance on Broadway.

04:45.425 --> 04:47.759
I can't believe I'm actually
gonna dance on Broadway.

04:47.794 --> 04:51.596
It all still feels so...
so surreal.

04:51.632 --> 04:55.500
I should get to rehearsal.
But I will see you opening night.

04:55.535 --> 04:58.069
Come backstage after.
I'll put you on the list.

04:58.105 --> 04:59.838
I wouldn't miss it.

05:16.256 --> 05:17.756
She couldn't get one more ticket

05:17.791 --> 05:19.758
for your sweet
old ailing mother?

05:19.793 --> 05:21.638
Please, you're healthier
than all of us combined.

05:21.662 --> 05:23.928
She could barely get me a ticket
and I'm her best friend.

05:23.964 --> 05:25.964
I'm just so thrilled
for Cassidy.

05:25.999 --> 05:28.566
Me too.
It's what she's always wanted.

05:28.602 --> 05:29.746
It was your dream, too,
once upon a time.

05:29.770 --> 05:32.203
I know, it was just so hard
putting my heart and soul

05:32.239 --> 05:34.406
into every piece and
always coming up short.

05:34.441 --> 05:38.243
So I am on a wonderful new path.

05:38.278 --> 05:41.646
And I'll still be choreographing,
just in a different way.

05:41.682 --> 05:43.314
What could be better than that?

05:43.350 --> 05:45.817
Well, dad and I are proud of you
no matter what.

05:45.852 --> 05:48.486
You've had to make some
tough decisions this past year.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.389
Some more difficult than others.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.660
Have you, talked to Peter?

05:55.696 --> 05:57.962
I don't think he wants
to talk to me.

05:57.998 --> 05:59.664
You know, he texted me.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.400
And despite everything
he misses you.

06:02.436 --> 06:05.270
Peter was perfect.
On paper.

06:05.305 --> 06:09.808
The reality was different.
I just couldn't go through with it.

06:09.843 --> 06:12.944
It has to be right.
Like you and dad.

06:12.979 --> 06:15.413
You did the right thing.
For both of you.

06:15.449 --> 06:17.449
And who knows
who you're gonna meet

06:17.484 --> 06:19.517
in the next phase of your life?

06:19.553 --> 06:22.487
I still don't think I'm quite ready
to start dating yet,

06:22.522 --> 06:23.488
what with buying the new studio,

06:23.523 --> 06:26.357
that's where my focus needs
to be right now.

06:26.393 --> 06:27.559
True.

06:27.594 --> 06:31.329
And you're gonna be so busy
you should probably give me

06:31.364 --> 06:34.165
the ticket to see
Cassidy's show.

06:34.201 --> 06:35.700
You're shameless, you know that?

07:06.700 --> 07:10.435
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

07:33.260 --> 07:34.359
Excuse me.

07:34.394 --> 07:35.394
Sorry.

07:36.696 --> 07:37.696
Sorry.

07:39.032 --> 07:42.367
- Name?
- Hope Mayes, I should be on the list.

07:42.402 --> 07:46.704
- No.
- My friend is in the show.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.774
- Excuse me?
- Don't bother, he doesn't care.

07:49.810 --> 07:52.343
Who is he guarding?
Is Rihanna inside?

07:52.379 --> 07:56.514
Could be. I've never seen
a stage door this crowded.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.650
- Hi, Mr. Gunderson.
- I'm not on the list.

07:58.685 --> 08:00.196
I just need to go backstage
to say a quick hello

08:00.220 --> 08:01.719
to Carlos Ruis, the writer.

08:01.755 --> 08:05.023
- Please, follow me.
- Hold on a second.

08:05.058 --> 08:07.725
- Are you two together?
- We're not.

08:07.761 --> 08:10.228
OK, well nobody gets in
who's name is not on the list.

08:10.263 --> 08:12.430
Well, he just told you
he's not on it.

08:12.465 --> 08:13.364
He's verifiable.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.433
Well, my last name
might not be Gunderson

08:15.468 --> 08:17.702
but if you could take two
seconds to call backstage

08:17.737 --> 08:19.971
you would find out
that I am also verifiable.

08:20.006 --> 08:21.284
Do you see all
these people waiting?

08:21.308 --> 08:22.819
How about I just run inside
really quickly

08:22.843 --> 08:24.709
and you two sort this out
amongst yourselves?

08:24.744 --> 08:29.314
- Yeah, of course, Mr. Gunderson.
- No, Mr. Gunderson?

08:29.349 --> 08:31.282
Now, I might not have
the name recognition

08:31.318 --> 08:33.051
but I hope you don't think
that your time

08:33.086 --> 08:35.820
is more valuable than mine,
do you, Mr. Gunderson?

08:35.856 --> 08:36.888
I am so late.

08:36.923 --> 08:39.256
Then maybe you should try
better time management.

08:39.292 --> 08:40.592
Excuse me.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.227
If you could just let
Cassidy Tyler know

08:42.261 --> 08:43.928
that her friend
is waiting outside,

08:43.964 --> 08:49.100
Mr. Gunderson will happily
wait his turn.

08:49.135 --> 08:51.480
You heard the lady.
Please, let's get on that radio.

08:51.504 --> 08:54.172
Then, hopefully, I will not be late
to meet my fiancé.

08:54.207 --> 08:58.243
- Would that be acceptable to you?
- Absolutely.

09:03.450 --> 09:06.551
I didn't... my friend's here.
I gotta go.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.755
- Amazing!
- Thank you.

09:10.790 --> 09:13.424
I was so nervous.
I couldn't stop shaking.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.559
You couldn't tell.

09:14.594 --> 09:15.638
And you have plenty of time
to get over those nerves

09:15.662 --> 09:18.429
'cause you get to do it
all again tomorrow night.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.298
I know.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.167
I wanna introduce you
to Vanessa Curson.

09:23.203 --> 09:24.335
The choreographer?

09:25.372 --> 09:26.337
She's one of the best.

09:26.373 --> 09:27.783
I know, and she's looking
for an assistant

09:27.807 --> 09:29.641
for an upcoming show in London.

09:29.676 --> 09:31.876
I know. I know
what you're gonna say.

09:31.912 --> 09:34.379
But I think you should
submit your resume.

09:34.414 --> 09:36.281
Your styles are so in sync.

09:36.316 --> 09:39.350
I've been down this road
and I know how it ends.

09:39.386 --> 09:41.686
I'm on a different path now
and that is the studio.

09:41.721 --> 09:44.355
Just say hello to her.
Make a connection and see.

09:44.391 --> 09:45.723
Like, it couldn't hurt.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.458
Vanessa!

09:52.432 --> 09:56.668
- Tell me these nerves will subside.
- Usually by show three.

09:56.703 --> 09:58.236
OK.

09:58.271 --> 10:02.240
- This is my friend Hope Mayes.
- Hi.

10:02.275 --> 10:03.975
She's also an amazing
choreographer.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.243
Well, more of a teacher now.

10:05.278 --> 10:08.646
I'm in the process of buying
a dance studio on 71st and Park.

10:08.682 --> 10:11.916
And she's choreographed
some amazing regional theater.

10:11.952 --> 10:14.752
I got my start in regional.
Where might I have seen your work?

10:14.788 --> 10:15.987
Nowhere recently.

10:16.022 --> 10:18.656
I'm just learning the ins and outs
of how to run a studio.

10:18.692 --> 10:20.236
That's what I've been
focused on lately.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.994
You know, you guys should talk
about the London gig.

10:23.029 --> 10:24.595
Hope would be great for it.

10:24.631 --> 10:28.199
She also studied under
Jacqueline Mauer in college.

10:28.234 --> 10:31.869
Jacqueline was my mentor
when I first got started.

10:31.905 --> 10:35.540
- What did you get on her final?
- A 93.

10:35.575 --> 10:39.110
A 93.
She must have liked you.

10:41.281 --> 10:44.382
Send me your resume.
I'd be happy to take a look.

10:44.417 --> 10:47.552
Cassidy has all my information.
It was really nice meeting you.

10:47.587 --> 10:49.687
You too.

10:50.090 --> 10:50.955
See?

10:50.991 --> 10:55.793
- You always throw your hat into the ring.
- And hope they don't throw the hat back.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.628
Well, you better submit
your resume

10:57.664 --> 11:01.432
or this friendship is over.
And I mean that.

11:01.468 --> 11:03.434
As I used to hear at almost
all of my auditions,

11:03.470 --> 11:07.438
I am going in a different
direction.

11:11.887 --> 11:15.046
- Is that...
- Yes.

11:15.081 --> 11:16.814
He's even more good-looking
in real life.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.127
You think we should go
over there?

11:18.151 --> 11:19.217
You know what?

11:19.252 --> 11:20.896
I'm just gonna casually
introduce you to Carlos or...

11:20.920 --> 11:24.322
Don't bother.
Eric Gunderson is entitled.

11:24.357 --> 11:26.257
And engaged.

11:26.292 --> 11:31.095
- Wait, how do you know all that?
- Long story.

11:37.137 --> 11:40.271
And, as you all know,
now that we're retiring,

11:40.306 --> 11:44.442
my son Eric and Max's daughter
Adriana will be taking the reins

11:44.477 --> 11:46.911
and guiding this firm
to the next level.

11:46.946 --> 11:49.147
It's time to pass the torch

11:49.182 --> 11:52.116
while keeping our respective
legacies in the family.

11:52.152 --> 11:54.352
Our fathers founded
this investment brokerage

11:54.387 --> 11:56.187
almost 80 years ago.

11:56.222 --> 11:58.156
I've been working here
since I was 15,

11:58.191 --> 12:01.759
and Eric joined the staff
after graduating college.

12:01.795 --> 12:03.027
As did my daughter.

12:03.063 --> 12:06.998
Now with the recent announcement
of Eric and Adriana's engagement

12:07.033 --> 12:11.169
it's the perfect marriage of the
professional and the personal.

12:11.204 --> 12:12.603
And we're very excited to see

12:12.639 --> 12:14.372
what the two of you
can do together.

12:14.407 --> 12:15.940
We promise to do right by you.

12:15.975 --> 12:17.686
And of course Gavin
will continue in his role

12:17.710 --> 12:19.877
as chief operating officer.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.512
We couldn't do it without him.

12:21.548 --> 12:24.682
And don't worry, you're
all invited to the wedding.

12:24.717 --> 12:26.217
It should be quite the affair

12:26.252 --> 12:28.453
once our wives get their hands on it,
you know.

12:38.665 --> 12:39.730
Knock knock.

12:39.766 --> 12:42.211
Sorry to barge in on you
in the middle of a work day, darling,

12:42.235 --> 12:45.002
and I know you're busy
but we have an appointment.

12:45.038 --> 12:47.071
What appointment?

12:47.107 --> 12:48.517
I don't have anything
on the calendar.

12:48.541 --> 12:52.477
- What is all this?
- Plans, clippings, a blueprint if you will.

12:52.512 --> 12:56.814
Time is short, Eric.
Planning a wedding is a huge undertaking.

12:56.850 --> 12:57.715
I get that, mother.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.751
But Adriana and I are in the middle
of taking over the company.

13:00.787 --> 13:04.188
We have to get started if we want
to be ready for a June wedding.

13:04.224 --> 13:05.823
We only have two months.

13:05.859 --> 13:08.559
OK, so we have
an October wedding.

13:08.595 --> 13:11.095
Adriana's always wanted
to get married in Central Park.

13:11.131 --> 13:15.600
Don't be silly, darling.
Society weddings happen in June.

13:15.635 --> 13:19.437
- Plus, the hotel had a cancellation.
- We have some ideas, as well.

13:19.472 --> 13:22.006
Great. Well, her mother
is on the way,

13:22.041 --> 13:23.708
as is our wedding planner,
Dinnie.

13:23.743 --> 13:25.176
Now, she's very much in demand

13:25.211 --> 13:27.345
so we have to work
around her schedule.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.882
She planned the wedding of the
Duke and Duchess of Caldecott.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.049
Really?

13:32.085 --> 13:34.385
That's the highest level
of royalty you could find, huh?

13:34.420 --> 13:38.389
Don't be cute.
You know I only hire the best.

13:43.429 --> 13:45.029
Thanks for switching
to this morning,

13:45.064 --> 13:47.143
I have a new private client
tomorrow. A wedding couple.

13:47.167 --> 13:51.569
Well, it is wedding season.
I have, like, three invitations already.

13:51.604 --> 13:54.872
Sorry, that was insensitive of me.

13:54.908 --> 13:56.908
You can talk about weddings
around me, Cass.

13:56.943 --> 13:58.609
I'm the one who called mine off.

13:58.645 --> 14:00.611
I know, but you and Peter
would be celebrating

14:00.647 --> 14:02.780
your first year anniversary
right about now.

14:02.815 --> 14:03.881
It's fine.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.050
Peter and I, we just
didn't speak the same language.

14:06.085 --> 14:08.986
I need someone who inspires me.

14:09.022 --> 14:09.921
I get that.

14:09.956 --> 14:12.790
I know that Peter wasn't right
for you, but... I don't know.

14:12.825 --> 14:15.104
- I just don't understand-...
- What don't you understand?

14:15.128 --> 14:16.472
Well, you're supposed to let go
of the things

14:16.496 --> 14:17.540
that don't work in your life,

14:17.564 --> 14:22.466
and Peter was one of those,
but your career isn't.

14:22.502 --> 14:26.103
I'm not giving up on my career,
I'm just altering it.

14:26.139 --> 14:27.316
When the thing you love most
in the world

14:27.340 --> 14:31.342
is your constant source of
rejection it's time to reassess.

14:31.377 --> 14:33.878
I'm just tired
of being disappointed.

14:35.882 --> 14:37.782
<i>Dinnie, no wonder</i>

14:37.817 --> 14:40.084
<i>they call you the best
wedding planner in the city.</i>

14:40.119 --> 14:42.086
<i>This is more water color.</i>

14:42.121 --> 14:43.487
Yes, I can see those together.

14:43.523 --> 14:44.455
<i>Isn't that pretty?</i>

14:44.490 --> 14:46.490
Now, I need those names
and addresses pronto

14:46.526 --> 14:48.759
if we wanna get that save
the date out this week.

14:48.795 --> 14:52.630
We'll get on the head count,
but just to be safe I'd order 400.

14:52.665 --> 14:53.698
400?

14:53.733 --> 14:55.967
We were thinking something
a little more intimate.

14:56.002 --> 14:59.870
We know it's your wedding but
it's also a coming out of sorts.

14:59.906 --> 15:01.038
For the business.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.874
It's Gunderson and Grimes.
The next generation.

15:03.910 --> 15:07.478
- Our clients are our friends, you know.
- That's true.

15:07.513 --> 15:09.614
And they'd find out
if they weren't invited

15:09.649 --> 15:12.650
since the Times is featuring us
in the wedding section.

15:12.685 --> 15:14.552
Very big spread.

15:14.587 --> 15:16.220
They're even sending
a photographer to LA

15:16.256 --> 15:18.456
for your dress fitting, Adriana.

15:18.491 --> 15:22.293
OK, I get it.
Is that all, though?

15:22.328 --> 15:24.228
Eric and I have
a conference call.

15:24.264 --> 15:26.497
Just one more thing.

15:26.532 --> 15:28.299
Eric?

15:28.334 --> 15:31.202
You remember
high school cotillion.

15:31.237 --> 15:33.304
- Do you want a repeat of that?
- No, he does not.

15:33.339 --> 15:35.406
- I do not.
- Good!

15:35.441 --> 15:38.209
Because I signed you both up for
dance lessons starting tomorrow.

15:38.244 --> 15:41.412
Incredible teacher.
I'll email you the address.

15:41.447 --> 15:43.514
You'll be Fred Astaire
by summer.

15:53.259 --> 15:56.260
Beautiful job, ladies.
Thank you.

15:56.296 --> 15:58.129
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:01.768 --> 16:04.068
Hope?

16:04.103 --> 16:06.437
Hi.
I'm Adriana.

16:06.472 --> 16:09.473
- Yes, Sofia told me to expect you.
- It's so good to meet you.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.409
I'm sorry, my fiancé
is running a bit late

16:11.444 --> 16:14.078
but he just texted me.
He'll be here soon.

16:14.113 --> 16:15.457
OK, well let's just head on
over here,

16:15.481 --> 16:16.447
you can put your things down

16:16.482 --> 16:19.550
and tell me a little bit
about your experience.

16:19.585 --> 16:22.553
All Sofia's told me is that we're
short on time and it's urgent.

16:22.588 --> 16:23.732
Well, she's not exaggerating.

16:23.756 --> 16:26.624
I have a good 12 years of dance
experience under my belt

16:26.659 --> 16:31.062
but my fiancé is what you might
call rhythmically challenged.

16:31.097 --> 16:34.198
I've had great success with
the rhythmically challenged.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.166
That's good to know.

16:35.201 --> 16:37.702
Our mothers want
performance-level quality

16:37.737 --> 16:40.705
as if that's the key to
a lasting relationship.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.940
They're also on the board
of the New York City ballet

16:42.975 --> 16:45.443
and they are dead set
on the waltz.

16:45.478 --> 16:47.211
Well, we'll get you two
in good shape.

16:47.246 --> 16:48.179
I am so sorry.

16:48.214 --> 16:51.315
I was with a client
and he would not stop...

16:51.351 --> 16:53.918
- You.
- Hi.

16:53.953 --> 16:58.055
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, we've met.

16:58.091 --> 17:01.459
But Mr. Gunderson and I got off
on the wrong foot.

17:01.494 --> 17:04.762
Yeah, I uh, I apologize
if I was rude.

17:04.797 --> 17:07.431
- It won't happen again.
- Fine.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.911
Well, we should get started
because we've got two months

17:08.935 --> 17:10.968
and a lot of ground to cover.

17:12.338 --> 17:15.373
Come on, Mr. Wrong Foot.
Dance with me.

17:17.710 --> 17:22.413
Step right, and front,
and right.

17:24.483 --> 17:26.916
Sorry.
This is cotillion all over again.

17:26.953 --> 17:30.187
You can do this, Eric.
You're good at everything.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.989
It's really annoying sometimes.

17:32.024 --> 17:33.235
Well, then you should
be thrilled

17:33.259 --> 17:35.760
that I can't seem to get my brain
to connect with my feet.

17:35.795 --> 17:37.194
Let's try it again.
Slowly.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.430
What do you think?
Are we completely hopeless?

17:39.465 --> 17:42.633
Not at all. I have had
far more challenging clients.

17:42.668 --> 17:43.768
So, what do you suggest?

17:43.803 --> 17:46.837
Two, maybe three lessons
per week, get down the basics,

17:46.873 --> 17:48.672
and then I'll choreograph
something

17:48.708 --> 17:52.209
for the two of you that suits you.
It'll be perfect.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.345
I was hoping two or three
lessons in total.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.413
It's a very busy time for us
right now,

17:56.449 --> 17:58.315
especially when the stock market
is open.

17:58.351 --> 17:59.450
Due to our regular classes,

17:59.485 --> 18:03.387
mornings are when we meet
with our private clients.

18:03.422 --> 18:06.423
I don't want to embarrass myself
in front of 400 people.

18:06.459 --> 18:08.792
That's 800 eyes watching me,
judging me.

18:08.828 --> 18:10.828
No one's judging you in here.

18:10.863 --> 18:13.964
What if you came in on your
own until you were comfortable?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.233
Isn't the whole point for us
to learn together?

18:16.269 --> 18:17.368
Just for the basics.

18:17.403 --> 18:20.137
I'll cover things at work
and come and go as needed,

18:20.172 --> 18:22.139
and then when it's time
to learn the dance

18:22.174 --> 18:23.908
I'll make myself available.

18:23.943 --> 18:27.478
- Twice a week?
- Maybe three times.

18:29.382 --> 18:31.026
Are you sure you don't mind
holding down the fort?

18:31.050 --> 18:32.583
Alone, while I'm here?

18:32.618 --> 18:34.652
We pick up the slack
for each other, Eric.

18:34.687 --> 18:37.187
Besides, Gavin will step up.

18:37.223 --> 18:41.458
You can do it.
You're a man of many talents.

18:41.494 --> 18:42.860
If only dancing were
one of them.

18:42.895 --> 18:47.264
OK. Tomorrow, 11 am.
Please be on time.

18:51.605 --> 18:55.774
And one, two, three, four.

18:55.809 --> 18:59.511
Very nice.
And across the floor.

18:59.546 --> 19:02.614
Alright, chin up, Adam.

19:02.649 --> 19:05.417
And turn.

19:05.452 --> 19:07.285
Very nice.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.220
And dip.

19:11.825 --> 19:14.959
Not a dry eye in the house.
You guys are ready for the big day.

19:14.995 --> 19:16.161
Thanks, Hope.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.107
And please, feel free to bring
a guest on Saturday night.

19:18.131 --> 19:21.566
I cannot wait to watch you
walk down the aisle.

19:21.601 --> 19:24.736
Are you gonna turn me into that?
I'm gonna try.

19:24.771 --> 19:27.338
Only time will tell
if I succeed.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.175
11 am on the nose.
Very good.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.610
I didn't wanna subject myself
to your wrath again.

19:32.646 --> 19:33.578
My wrath?

19:33.613 --> 19:35.413
I suspect your bark is worse
than your bite

19:35.449 --> 19:37.093
but you can be quite scary
when you wanna be.

19:37.117 --> 19:40.118
Only when people behave
as if my time isn't valuable.

19:40.153 --> 19:41.653
I'll see you two Saturday night.

19:41.688 --> 19:44.322
Bye, Hope.
Thanks again for everything.

19:46.293 --> 19:51.296
Look, I'm not your
favourite person, I get that.

19:51.331 --> 19:54.032
I am really sorry
about the other night.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.001
That's not me.
I mean, not usually.

19:57.037 --> 20:01.272
It's just... that play.
It blew me away.

20:01.308 --> 20:03.875
I was still thinking about it
the next day.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.310
I agree.

20:05.345 --> 20:06.856
It was everything
the theater should be.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.148
Right. And Carlos is
incredibly talented.

20:10.183 --> 20:12.984
I knew that after I read
his first play, Highest Crimes.

20:13.019 --> 20:14.652
Yeah, I put up the money
as a favour

20:14.688 --> 20:17.856
but it was one of the best
experiences of my life.

20:17.891 --> 20:21.493
I would stand in the wings and
I'd watch the audience's reaction.

20:21.528 --> 20:24.295
You invested in a play?

20:24.331 --> 20:26.297
Why do you look so surprised?

20:26.333 --> 20:27.810
I don't know, I just sort of
had you pegged

20:27.834 --> 20:32.170
as a Wall Street finance numbers
kinda guy.

20:32.205 --> 20:35.206
Judge a book by its cover,
you might miss out on a good story.

20:35.242 --> 20:39.410
- OK, tell me the story.
- OK.

20:39.446 --> 20:43.314
In a nutshell I'm not as stuffy
as I might seem.

20:43.350 --> 20:47.418
Physical activity tends to come
relatively easy to me.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.522
What I lack is that little thing
called rhythm.

20:50.557 --> 20:54.225
I know it well.

20:54.261 --> 20:57.162
Look, I don't want to make
a fool of myself

20:57.197 --> 20:59.330
in front of New York society.

20:59.366 --> 21:03.268
I did that once years ago.

21:03.303 --> 21:08.706
So, what do you say,
can you help me?

21:08.742 --> 21:10.175
I know I can.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.078
Good.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.687
It's important to remember
on the dance floor

21:22.722 --> 21:26.024
it's all about feeling.
Don't think about what you look like.

21:26.059 --> 21:29.427
Why not? Everyone else
will be thinking about it.

21:29.462 --> 21:33.097
OK, relax your arms.
You're not in a suit of Armour.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.867
Relax.
OK, now you're a noodle.

21:35.902 --> 21:37.035
Better.

21:37.070 --> 21:41.639
OK, we're going for strong
and confident, yet relaxed.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.576
I'm a Gunderson.
Relaxed is not our natural state.

21:44.611 --> 21:45.944
We're gonna have
to work on that.

21:45.979 --> 21:48.613
Well, don't tell me
you haven't been warned.

21:48.648 --> 21:51.082
I can see I'm gonna have to
think outside the box with you.

21:51.117 --> 21:52.584
Now, let's do this.

21:52.619 --> 21:56.054
This foot out.
Together.

21:56.089 --> 22:00.758
Same foot, move back.
Together.

22:00.794 --> 22:03.795
This foot out.
Together.

22:03.830 --> 22:04.996
Good job.

22:05.031 --> 22:07.600
Same foot front.
Together.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.984
I've gone over the financials
for the studio

22:15.008 --> 22:17.141
and it looks like the income
would far exceed

22:17.177 --> 22:18.810
the monthly mortgage payment.

22:18.845 --> 22:21.579
That's great.
So what would be the next step?

22:21.615 --> 22:23.015
Well, you fill out
this application,

22:23.049 --> 22:25.250
we run a credit check,
our underwriter reviews it,

22:25.285 --> 22:26.317
signs off on the loan,

22:26.353 --> 22:30.655
and then you become the owner
of a dance studio.

22:30.690 --> 22:32.757
I'll be the owner
of a dance studio.

22:39.332 --> 22:41.366
The long-time clients,
the old money crew,

22:41.401 --> 22:42.445
they're creatures of habit.

22:42.469 --> 22:45.003
They're used to the way
your fathers do business.

22:45.038 --> 22:46.971
What if we give some sort
of dinner

22:47.007 --> 22:49.107
to present the new investment
strategy?

22:49.142 --> 22:50.375
Maybe a Jacques Bouchon.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.478
Nobody walks away when you put
that caviar in front of them.

22:53.513 --> 22:56.214
Except maybe Eric.
He hates caviar.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.548
What do you think, Eric?

22:58.852 --> 23:00.551
Sorry, it's Carlos.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.131
Gavin, can you believe
she didn't wanna go

23:02.155 --> 23:03.821
to the best show on Broadway
with me?

23:03.857 --> 23:05.456
A little bit.

23:05.492 --> 23:08.037
Come on, you know me.
Theater isn't my thing, either.

23:08.061 --> 23:09.027
Well, it's your loss.

23:09.062 --> 23:11.829
I'd much rather go home
at the end of a long day

23:11.865 --> 23:14.499
and open a nice Pinot
and read Business Weekly

23:14.534 --> 23:15.566
or the Economist.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.735
You know, I bet you already
do that every night.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.337
I bet you do, too.

23:19.372 --> 23:22.640
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but if we're going to have

23:22.676 --> 23:24.976
these dendrobium orchids
flown in from Thailand

23:25.011 --> 23:27.145
decisions need to be made now.

23:28.348 --> 23:30.548
You can't have a conversation
with a giant monstrosity

23:30.583 --> 23:33.017
in the center of a table.

23:33.053 --> 23:35.386
A beautiful monstrosity.

23:35.422 --> 23:37.855
<i>Do you want to take care
of the flowers, Eric?</i>

23:37.891 --> 23:41.559
I'm happy to scratch
one thing off my list.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.739
Can we get something smaller
than the Chrysler building?

23:43.763 --> 23:45.863
Sure. Change of plans.

23:45.899 --> 23:47.610
Dinnie, Eric will be taking over
the florals.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.400
Make sure they fit
with our colours.

23:49.436 --> 23:51.736
Tell the florist celadon blue,
and bone.

23:51.771 --> 23:53.838
No, no, no, no.
That's not what I meant...

23:53.873 --> 23:55.618
No, no, no. I will leave it
in your capable hands.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.342
It's your wedding, after all.

23:57.377 --> 24:00.078
I will leave you to this fun and
I'm gonna call Jacques Bouchon

24:00.113 --> 24:02.180
about a tasting
for the client dinner.

24:02.215 --> 24:03.781
Make a reservation
for all of us, Gavin.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.917
Jacques Bouchon is perfect
for the rehearsal dinner.

24:05.952 --> 24:08.186
Mother, don't drag Gavin
into our wedding planning.

24:08.221 --> 24:09.754
He's already got enough
on his plate.

24:09.789 --> 24:12.957
- No, I don't mind at all.
- You're a dear.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.193
Alright then, moving on.

24:15.228 --> 24:16.594
<i>So what do you think
of lavender?</i>

24:16.629 --> 24:18.997
<i>- No, we don't.
- No?</i>

24:23.470 --> 24:27.071
May I please speak to Eric Gunderson?
This is Hope Mayes.

24:29.409 --> 24:31.042
Hello?

24:31.077 --> 24:33.544
Put her through.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.746
Hope?

24:34.781 --> 24:38.216
So you know how I said we need
to think outside the box?

24:38.251 --> 24:41.719
I know, and I'm terrified.

24:41.755 --> 24:44.555
Are you and Adriana available
to meet me Saturday?

24:44.591 --> 24:46.502
She's going to LA this weekend
to meet with her dress designer

24:46.526 --> 24:48.393
but I guess I can move
some things around.

24:48.428 --> 24:49.727
That works.

24:49.763 --> 24:51.329
You're the one that needs this,
anyway.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.797
<i>I'll text you the details.</i>

24:52.832 --> 24:56.801
Our next lesson is going to be
a bit unorthodox.

24:56.836 --> 24:58.870
I can't wait.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.028
A tuxedo.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.497
I do have to say I am impressed
with the extent

25:26.533 --> 25:28.266
to which you follow
instructions.

25:28.301 --> 25:31.469
You said formal attire, and
I don't do anything halfway.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.064
I don't want you to watch
the bride and groom.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.433
- Isn't that the whole point?
- Not for you.

26:02.469 --> 26:05.403
Take in the faces
of everyone watching.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.473
The maid of honor,
the parents of the bride,

26:08.508 --> 26:10.308
the best man's had a little
too much champagne

26:10.343 --> 26:12.877
so let's bypass him.

26:12.912 --> 26:15.847
Pure joy on everyone's faces.

26:15.882 --> 26:19.584
They're all here to celebrate
the beginning of this journey.

26:19.619 --> 26:23.521
Not a single person cares
about the performance.

26:23.556 --> 26:25.323
Life isn't about appearances,
Eric.

26:25.358 --> 26:26.891
Yeah, but that's the thing.

26:26.926 --> 26:28.938
When you live your life in
the public eye it sort of is.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.496
You have to let that go.

26:35.435 --> 26:38.503
That's what this is about.
Love.

26:38.538 --> 26:41.606
They're surrounded by it.
They're in it.

26:41.641 --> 26:45.743
Once we focus on true love
then everything else falls into place.

27:00.126 --> 27:02.160
<i>Cheers!</i>

27:04.130 --> 27:07.798
OK, you've had your cake,
now it's time for our lesson.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.734
I thought this was our lesson.

27:09.769 --> 27:11.135
I kind of feel like
I'm nailing it.

27:12.472 --> 27:14.305
If only my job were cake.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.474
But I am being paid right now
to teach you to dance

27:16.509 --> 27:18.376
and I take that very seriously.

27:18.411 --> 27:21.078
Well, I am not just eating.
I'm researching.

27:21.114 --> 27:23.714
I'm checking out flowers
for my wedding.

27:23.750 --> 27:27.985
- I inadvertently took on that task.
- You don't have a wedding planner?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.820
Yes, but somehow I got stuck
doing flowers.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.056
As if I know anything
about flowers.

27:32.091 --> 27:34.069
And the wedding planner insists
that everything at this wedding

27:34.093 --> 27:35.259
make a statement.

27:35.295 --> 27:36.527
What kind of statement?

27:36.563 --> 27:40.898
I can't be sure but I think it's
"look how much money that cost".

27:42.702 --> 27:44.135
That's why you hire
a good florist

27:44.170 --> 27:47.305
and they narrow down your options
to your personal preference.

27:47.340 --> 27:48.851
You wanna know
my personal preference?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.008
Centerpieces that are
less than nine feet tall.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.289
I actually have the perfect person
and it's by the studio

27:53.313 --> 27:55.613
so I'll bring you by next time
you're there for a lesson.

27:55.648 --> 27:57.648
That's not really part
of your job description.

27:57.684 --> 27:59.083
Happy to help.

27:59.118 --> 28:01.152
You seem a little over your head
with this one.

28:01.187 --> 28:03.654
I am way past that point.

28:03.690 --> 28:05.256
OK, problem solved.

28:05.291 --> 28:07.291
Stop stalling.
Let's dance.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.464
OK.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.100
Just one...

28:18.805 --> 28:19.903
so good.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.078
Look into my eyes.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.297
We're not gonna worry about
the steps right now,

28:35.321 --> 28:38.256
we're gonna get you comfortable
on the dance floor.

28:38.291 --> 28:41.092
I try to avoid dance floors
whenever possible.

28:41.127 --> 28:45.163
Dance floors and forest fires.
Both are like natural disasters to me.

28:45.198 --> 28:49.567
So what happened at cotillion
to make you swear it off?

28:49.602 --> 28:51.335
Paige Jeffries.

28:51.371 --> 28:54.405
She was the most beautiful girl
in Parkwell Academy

28:54.441 --> 28:56.774
and I was dancing with her
up on a stage

28:56.810 --> 28:59.777
and I tried to impress her
with some fancy moves

28:59.813 --> 29:01.646
and I lead us both right off
the edge.

29:01.681 --> 29:02.647
Oh no.

29:02.682 --> 29:05.149
I only sprained my ankle
but she broke her nose.

29:05.185 --> 29:08.286
In front of everyone.
It was humiliating.

29:08.321 --> 29:10.855
More so for my family.

29:10.890 --> 29:13.925
Paige's dad was a big client.
"Was" being the operative word.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.526
Well, there's no stage
in the ballroom

29:15.562 --> 29:18.663
so the chances of a repeat
performance are slim.

29:18.698 --> 29:19.831
Have you met me?

29:19.866 --> 29:22.433
You should have seen those
two when they came to me.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.435
Nothing but left feet.

29:25.171 --> 29:27.171
Have you always done weddings?

29:27.207 --> 29:29.307
Wedding choreography
is part of the job.

29:29.342 --> 29:32.944
Before that I did regional
theater in the tri state area

29:32.979 --> 29:35.947
before auditioning
for the big jobs.

29:35.982 --> 29:39.350
Why don't you do it anymore?
You're clearly very talented.

29:39.385 --> 29:41.686
I would have paid money
to watch those two perform.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.357
Well, my dance cart
is rather full at the moment

29:46.392 --> 29:48.326
with one Eric Gunderson.

29:49.696 --> 29:53.898
Well, I'll try to be a quick study
so you can get back to the fun gigs.

29:53.933 --> 29:56.667
Because you are good at this.

30:06.012 --> 30:06.911
OK.

30:06.946 --> 30:08.157
I think you're gonna see
some improvement.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.548
I almost got him comfortable
on a dance floor last weekend

30:10.583 --> 30:11.616
while you were gone.

30:11.651 --> 30:14.552
You'll be there with us
on our wedding day, right?

30:14.587 --> 30:17.488
- If you want me to be.
- We do.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.824
Don't mind us,
we're not even here.

30:19.859 --> 30:24.028
This gentleman is from the Times
for our feature about the wedding.

30:24.063 --> 30:27.098
- He's just gonna take a few pictures.
- Yes, keep doing what you're doing.

30:27.133 --> 30:30.501
OK, remember what I said
about people watching?

30:30.537 --> 30:31.669
Right.

30:31.704 --> 30:35.039
Eye contact with your partner,
block everything else out.

30:35.074 --> 30:36.841
That's right. Block us out.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.943
Try to get them in a fancy pose

30:38.978 --> 30:41.612
as sort of a taste of what's
to come on the big day.

30:41.648 --> 30:43.425
We haven't really worked
on the fancy poses yet,

30:43.449 --> 30:45.416
we're still working
on the basics.

30:45.451 --> 30:52.485
So chin up, strong arms,
and right and back.

30:52.992 --> 30:55.393
Darling, she's not
under quarantine.

30:55.428 --> 30:56.594
You can hold her closer.

30:56.629 --> 30:59.263
- I thought he was improving.
- He is, a lot.

30:59.299 --> 31:01.599
Is he gonna be ready?
We don't have much time.

31:01.634 --> 31:04.368
We'll be ready, mother.
We know how important this is.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.369
We've got this.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.972
Now take the pictures
and let us finish. OK?

31:08.007 --> 31:12.210
- Why don't we do the dip?
- That would make a lovely picture.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.245
Sorry.

31:24.457 --> 31:27.258
Don't worry,
we've only just begun.

31:28.828 --> 31:30.995
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

31:31.030 --> 31:33.664
So tell me one little thing
about Eric Gunderson

31:33.700 --> 31:35.077
now that you've had
a few lessons with him.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.969
You know Sofia doesn't like me
to talk too much about our clients.

31:38.004 --> 31:40.304
I'm not asking for their
social security numbers,

31:40.340 --> 31:43.140
I just wanna know
if he's still an entitled jerk.

31:43.176 --> 31:45.476
He's not at all
how I thought he'd be.

31:45.511 --> 31:48.145
I actually like him and Adriana
a lot.

31:48.181 --> 31:49.880
Really?

31:52.118 --> 31:56.621
- So how's the show going?
- You won't believe it.

31:56.656 --> 32:00.458
I get to understudy the lead in July
when she goes on vacation.

32:00.493 --> 32:05.696
- That's incredible, Cass.
- Did you ever submit your resume?

32:05.732 --> 32:07.331
Look, I don't deny
that choreographing

32:07.367 --> 32:10.334
has always been my favourite
part but I'm on to a new venture

32:10.370 --> 32:13.371
and it wouldn't really make sense for me
to go to London right now, anyway.

32:13.406 --> 32:16.340
But it's London.

32:16.376 --> 32:17.541
So?

32:17.971 --> 32:18.971
OK.

32:22.181 --> 32:23.821
I'm having Gavin put together
some numbers

32:23.850 --> 32:25.060
and we can bring it to the board

32:25.084 --> 32:28.519
as our first official decision
in charge.

32:28.554 --> 32:31.389
- You really love this.
- I do.

32:31.424 --> 32:33.068
It's what I've been working
towards since college.

32:33.092 --> 32:34.825
Yeah, I know.

32:34.861 --> 32:38.396
But I feel like we're not doing
anything meaningful.

32:38.431 --> 32:40.464
We're transforming
financial portfolios.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.900
I think our clients would tend
to disagree.

32:42.935 --> 32:45.369
We're giving people
financial security.

32:45.405 --> 32:48.072
And I love that about it
but I'd just like to be

32:48.107 --> 32:50.308
a part of something
that makes people think.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.311
Something that's actually
transformative.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.981
Good financial news
is transformative.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.382
For me, too.

32:58.418 --> 33:00.484
But are you happy?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.753
I am.

33:02.789 --> 33:05.423
Everything's going
according to the plan.

33:05.458 --> 33:10.027
The business is ours,
the wedding's going to be perfect.

33:10.063 --> 33:12.730
We're getting what we want.

33:12.765 --> 33:15.499
Yeah. We are.

33:26.813 --> 33:27.945
Hope, good. You're here.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.181
I want to go over all the
payroll information with you

33:30.216 --> 33:31.894
so that when you take
over there'll be no lapse.

33:31.918 --> 33:34.018
What is the status
of the loan, anyway?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.754
- I'm waiting to hear.
- Wonderful.

33:36.789 --> 33:39.357
'Cause I received a call today,
somebody else is interested

33:39.392 --> 33:42.460
in the studio.
But I'll tell them no.

33:42.495 --> 33:43.327
No, don't do that.

33:43.363 --> 33:46.030
I mean, what if I don't
get approved?

33:46.065 --> 33:47.698
Are you having second thoughts,
Hope?

33:47.734 --> 33:50.868
There'd be no shame in that,
but I do need to know soon.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.915
No, I just-I don't want you
to miss out on the opportunity

33:52.939 --> 33:54.238
if I don't qualify, that's all.

33:54.273 --> 33:57.074
Is there any way
to hold them off for a bit?

33:57.110 --> 33:59.877
Yeah, for a little while
I suppose.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.516
Thank you for doing this.

34:05.551 --> 34:07.785
I know it's not on the official
dance lesson plan.

34:07.820 --> 34:10.021
Well, it's still wedding adjacent.

34:10.056 --> 34:12.123
Now, let's go meet this florist
because tomorrow

34:12.158 --> 34:13.835
I'm gonna start teaching you
the actual steps.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.659
That's great news.

34:27.206 --> 34:29.172
Just take a look in the book,
see what you like

34:29.208 --> 34:30.975
and they can customize it
any way.

34:32.210 --> 34:36.514
- There's a cat in a flower shop.
- This is Lulu.

34:36.549 --> 34:39.817
She's kinda the mascot here.

34:39.851 --> 34:44.889
Help a guy out here, Lulu.
Irises or Lilys?

34:47.226 --> 34:50.261
I know, I have no idea, either.

34:50.295 --> 34:53.697
Notice your arms,
how you're holding her,

34:53.733 --> 34:57.034
cradling her gently
with nothing but affection?

34:57.070 --> 34:59.937
That is how you hold
your dance partner.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.339
Your bride.

35:01.374 --> 35:03.052
You're not thinking about
what it feels like

35:03.076 --> 35:04.875
or where your arms go.

35:04.911 --> 35:07.111
You just are.

35:07.146 --> 35:10.381
Sometimes we have to be
reminded not to think.

35:13.419 --> 35:15.753
So how do you know this florist
and her cat so well?

35:15.788 --> 35:17.788
I hired her for my wedding.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.691
- You're married?
- Supposed to be a year ago.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.728
But I called it off
a few weeks before.

35:23.763 --> 35:28.299
I imagine that was hard, to feel
misunderstood by your partner.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.435
Everything was measured by him.
He was so afraid to make a mistake

35:31.471 --> 35:33.304
that he didn't want me to make
any, either.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.373
And do you?
Make a lot of mistakes?

35:35.408 --> 35:37.975
I try not to?

35:38.010 --> 35:41.112
There's this assistant
choreography job in London,

35:41.147 --> 35:44.048
I could send in my resume
and further subject myself

35:44.083 --> 35:45.783
to potential rejection

35:45.818 --> 35:48.219
or I could commit to buying
the studio,

35:48.254 --> 35:50.888
which is a really good option.

35:50.923 --> 35:53.991
I had this professor in college
who used to say life's a gamble,

35:54.026 --> 35:55.326
so make it interesting.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.894
He even made us write
our own bios.

35:56.929 --> 35:58.929
So what do you want
your book jacket to say?

35:58.965 --> 36:04.101
I guess I'd want it to say she
was brave and had no regrets.

36:04.137 --> 36:06.737
- And she never aged.
- OK.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.408
- So there's the choice.
- If only it were that simple.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.945
Here's the story of Hope Mayes.

36:14.981 --> 36:19.016
She could have gone to London,
tea at the Ritz every day,

36:19.051 --> 36:20.696
touring the National Gallery
on her days off,

36:20.720 --> 36:24.488
but, she'll never know

36:24.524 --> 36:28.759
because she never submitted
her resume.

36:28.795 --> 36:32.029
I guess you could say that
we're sort of in the same boat.

36:32.064 --> 36:32.963
How so?

36:32.999 --> 36:36.133
Carlos has this new play, it's about
vets returning from the war

36:36.169 --> 36:38.436
and he wants me to produce it,
not just finance it.

36:38.471 --> 36:43.274
And it's really incredible
but... but the business, it's-

36:43.309 --> 36:48.045
Here's the story of Eric Gunderson.
He could have produced this juggernaut,

36:48.080 --> 36:50.381
changing lives in its sixth
season on Broadway

36:50.416 --> 36:55.019
and printing more money
than the US mint but he passed.

36:56.656 --> 36:58.622
OK.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.526
So whaddya say?

37:02.562 --> 37:04.829
You submit your resume
and I talk to Carlos

37:04.864 --> 37:08.866
and see if I can juggle both?

37:08.901 --> 37:13.370
- So is the tea at the Ritz really good?
- There's only one way to find out.

37:20.413 --> 37:24.882
Attaching resume.
Hat, meet ring.

37:28.922 --> 37:33.258
Four and dip.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.494
And good job.

37:35.529 --> 37:36.728
Change your shoes.

37:36.764 --> 37:39.644
- I feel like I'm making progress, right?
- You're making great progress.

37:42.035 --> 37:45.237
- Hello?
- Hope? It's Vanessa Curson.

37:45.272 --> 37:46.304
Hi Vanessa.

37:46.340 --> 37:49.074
<i>So I was looking over
your resume last night.</i>

37:49.109 --> 37:52.411
You choreographed Borrowed Magic
for the Connecticut Playhouse.

37:52.446 --> 37:54.913
- That was a great show.
- You saw it?

37:54.948 --> 37:56.826
<i>I never understood why
it didn't make it to Broadway.</i>

37:56.850 --> 37:58.328
So listen, I would love for you
to put together

37:58.352 --> 38:00.018
an audition piece for me.

38:00.053 --> 38:02.053
- Really?
- Yes, really.

38:02.089 --> 38:04.000
I'll email you the music file
and all the details.

38:04.024 --> 38:05.891
<i>That would be great, thank you.</i>

38:08.028 --> 38:10.495
She wants me to put together
an audition piece.

38:10.531 --> 38:12.597
And you almost didn't send
your resume.

38:14.468 --> 38:16.168
So?

38:16.203 --> 38:17.502
How do you feel?

38:17.538 --> 38:19.271
Conflicted.

38:19.306 --> 38:22.841
I love the idea of telling
a story without words,

38:22.876 --> 38:25.277
so that's exciting.

38:25.312 --> 38:27.612
But?

38:27.648 --> 38:30.115
There was this job
about a year ago

38:30.150 --> 38:32.818
to choreograph this dance tour.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.053
The best dancers
in the business.

38:35.088 --> 38:38.356
The job was mine.
I was so sure.

38:38.392 --> 38:42.027
And then it wasn't,

38:42.062 --> 38:44.463
and I just got so tired of
hearing how talented I was

38:44.498 --> 38:47.232
but here's a hundred reasons
why we didn't pick you.

38:47.267 --> 38:50.135
And that's when the opportunity
to buy the studio came along.

38:50.170 --> 38:53.472
I understand that but doesn't
this seem like a second chance?

38:53.507 --> 38:56.508
It just feels like I have one
foot on each side of the fence.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.243
I know how that feels.

38:58.278 --> 39:01.646
I studied theater and finance.
Dual major.

39:01.682 --> 39:03.715
It can make your head spin a bit
but one was for me

39:03.750 --> 39:05.684
and one was for my dad.

39:05.719 --> 39:09.020
- Finance won?
- I guess you could say that.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.589
But after I read Carlos's
first play

39:10.624 --> 39:12.691
I knew I had to be a part of it.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.759
And those were some pretty
great coattails to jump

39:14.795 --> 39:16.027
on my first time out.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.664
- Carlos is taking off.
- And he wants me to come along with him.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.167
So what's the problem?

39:22.202 --> 39:25.036
Adriana, she gets more excited
every day

39:25.105 --> 39:26.438
about taking over the business,

39:26.473 --> 39:30.709
and as we get deeper into it
I'm conflicted.

39:30.744 --> 39:34.880
There's so much I wanna do and
none of it happens in that office.

39:34.915 --> 39:38.550
I think you just sound like someone
who has to pick a side of the fence.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.235
When you said you had
the perfect location

40:19.259 --> 40:20.959
to make a dancer out of me

40:20.994 --> 40:24.229
I was thinking like a night club
or something.

40:24.264 --> 40:25.297
You thought wrong.

40:25.332 --> 40:27.465
I'm not sure how Central Park
comes in to play.

40:27.501 --> 40:29.568
You'll see. Come on.

40:39.212 --> 40:42.681
Take off your shoes and socks
and roll up your pants.

40:42.716 --> 40:44.482
We're going in there?

40:44.518 --> 40:48.119
OK, first a stranger's wedding

40:48.155 --> 40:50.822
and then a cat in a flower shop
and now the pond?

40:52.359 --> 40:55.527
- Are you Mr. Miyagi-ing me?
- Don't underestimate it.

40:55.562 --> 40:58.597
Mr. Miyagi lead the karate kid
to a big win.

40:58.632 --> 41:00.599
It's time to let appearances go.

41:00.634 --> 41:03.301
You've gotta be tired of
those fancy shoes, anyway.

41:03.337 --> 41:07.138
You know, I was taught that
rules are there to be followed.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.373
What rules?

41:08.408 --> 41:10.286
I don't see any signs anywhere
saying don't enter the pond.

41:10.310 --> 41:12.377
Some rules are unspoken.

41:12.412 --> 41:15.614
Sooner or later you're gonna learn
it's best not to argue with me.

41:15.649 --> 41:18.450
No, I got that.

41:18.485 --> 41:20.485
Get in, Gunderson.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.955
Well...

41:29.563 --> 41:32.397
Look at the water.
It has an ebb and flow.

41:32.432 --> 41:35.467
It's impossible for it to be rigid,
which is the opposite of you.

41:36.336 --> 41:38.169
You need to learn
to be the water.

41:38.205 --> 41:41.640
All swimming upstream will get
you is some very tired arms.

41:46.113 --> 41:47.545
Like the water.

41:47.581 --> 41:49.571
Ebb and flow.

41:50.824 --> 41:53.514
Ebb and flow.

42:09.569 --> 42:11.403
You wanna try
the first eight count?

42:11.438 --> 42:13.038
Yeah.

42:13.073 --> 42:15.273
One, two, three,
one, two, three,

42:15.308 --> 42:17.842
...one, two, three.
Good.

42:17.878 --> 42:20.311
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

42:23.550 --> 42:25.083
Sorry.

42:25.118 --> 42:27.352
You make this really fun.

42:27.387 --> 42:32.924
It's cause there's no pressure.
You can just be you.

42:38.965 --> 42:42.567
OK, we are ready for Adriana
to come back in.

42:42.602 --> 42:45.070
- Alright.
- Yeah.

42:45.105 --> 42:47.205
Wax on, wax off.

42:51.478 --> 42:53.645
I am so sorry I'm late.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.147
The dress arrived and then
I couldn't get a cab.

42:56.183 --> 42:58.450
It's been one of those days.

42:58.485 --> 43:00.296
That's OK, we were just
rehearsing the beginning.

43:00.320 --> 43:04.255
- Did you get the video I sent?
- Yes, watched and memorized.

43:04.291 --> 43:05.390
This dress is huge.

43:05.425 --> 43:07.437
Much bigger than the sketches
the designer showed me.

43:07.461 --> 43:09.494
I don't know how I'm going
to dance in it.

43:09.529 --> 43:12.163
- We'll need to do a dry run.
- You want him to see you in it?

43:12.199 --> 43:15.500
No, we'll kick him out and give
it a twirl around the studio.

43:15.535 --> 43:16.501
I always think that's
a good idea.

43:16.536 --> 43:17.947
You don't want the first time
you dance in it

43:17.971 --> 43:18.870
to be your wedding day.

43:18.905 --> 43:20.805
I'm not so sure how I feel
about it anyway,

43:20.841 --> 43:23.641
so if I can't dance in it
then it definitely has to go.

43:32.052 --> 43:34.519
I look like a giant marshmallow,
don't I?

43:34.554 --> 43:36.821
I swear I was pressured
into this by my mother.

43:36.857 --> 43:38.590
She thought it would
photograph well.

43:38.625 --> 43:41.126
I think you're the most
beautiful bride I've ever seen.

43:41.161 --> 43:44.095
- Really?
- Turn around.

43:44.131 --> 43:49.334
So we use this loop to hold up
your skirt while you're dancing.

43:49.369 --> 43:52.604
Now, try the first few steps.

44:01.014 --> 44:03.648
I don't think it's gonna be
a problem.

44:03.683 --> 44:07.485
Everything has to be perfect,
right down to the napkin rings,

44:07.521 --> 44:09.888
which are being flown in
from France.

44:09.923 --> 44:12.390
We don't have good enough
napkin rings here in America?

44:12.425 --> 44:13.536
Everything is about the optics.

44:13.560 --> 44:17.061
How we're perceived is how
the business is perceived.

44:17.097 --> 44:18.229
It's intertwined.

44:18.265 --> 44:21.366
Well, as long as you're happy
that's all that matters.

44:21.401 --> 44:24.169
I wish I had time to enjoy it
more, but...

44:24.204 --> 44:27.539
- how does Eric seem to you?
- Fine.

44:27.574 --> 44:30.909
I mean, this doesn't come easily to him
so he's a little frustrated, but...

44:30.944 --> 44:33.511
Not-not the dancing,
I mean in general.

44:33.547 --> 44:35.713
Here we are, getting everything
we always talked about,

44:35.749 --> 44:38.683
and our reactions couldn't be
more different.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.552
Well, they say
opposites attract.

44:40.587 --> 44:43.254
They also say that nothing bonds
like common ground

44:43.290 --> 44:47.358
and I feel like we don't have
much of that anymore.

44:47.394 --> 44:49.928
Sometimes when life gets
particularly stressful

44:49.963 --> 44:52.597
we fall out of sync but
as soon as the dust settles

44:52.632 --> 44:56.401
we step right back
into our routine with ease.

44:56.436 --> 45:00.572
Yes. Maybe that's it.

45:00.607 --> 45:02.841
Timing.

45:05.045 --> 45:06.911
So I don't look like
a giant cake?

45:08.615 --> 45:10.882
No, you're stunning.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.588
I mean, a ten-piece orchestra,
twenty-piece orchestra,

45:16.623 --> 45:18.289
what difference does it make?

45:18.325 --> 45:21.726
- No difference. I want a band.
- Then we get a band.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.928
You know, some of our new
clients might like something

45:23.964 --> 45:25.296
a little more fresh.

45:25.332 --> 45:28.466
OK. I'll find one, since that
seems to be the only way

45:28.501 --> 45:30.246
to remotely get what we want
for this wedding.

45:30.270 --> 45:33.872
I know it feels like a runaway train,
everything's happening so fast.

45:33.907 --> 45:36.207
Two more weeks then, and
everything will settle down.

45:36.243 --> 45:37.575
Of course it will.

45:37.611 --> 45:39.277
But I do like this,

45:39.312 --> 45:41.813
being out in the world
in the middle of the day.

45:41.848 --> 45:44.082
Then we'll do more meetings
outside the office

45:44.117 --> 45:46.584
instead of having everyone
come to us.

45:46.620 --> 45:48.620
That's fine.

45:48.655 --> 45:50.822
I want to talk to you
about something.

45:50.857 --> 45:55.727
- I have a question for you, too.
- You go first.

45:55.762 --> 45:58.663
Are you regretting
taking over the company?

45:58.698 --> 46:01.232
No, not regretting per Se.

46:01.268 --> 46:06.504
I mean, I want it to be
hugely successful.

46:06.539 --> 46:10.441
But how would you feel
if I produced a play?

46:10.477 --> 46:12.944
How would that work
with the company?

46:12.979 --> 46:15.313
I'm not sure.
Maybe I could do both.

46:15.348 --> 46:16.781
I don't see how.

46:16.816 --> 46:19.751
The business is full-time
and so is producing.

46:19.786 --> 46:22.654
And if I figured out a way?

46:22.689 --> 46:25.323
I know you love this business
and I love watching you thrive

46:25.358 --> 46:27.292
as you take the reins
of this company,

46:27.327 --> 46:30.461
but I feel like I want more.

46:30.497 --> 46:34.132
More than an insanely successful
brokerage firm?

46:34.167 --> 46:36.634
I mean, it's the golden goose, Eric.

46:38.738 --> 46:40.538
Let's go in.

46:40.573 --> 46:42.273
In the pond?

46:43.343 --> 46:45.610
- In our clothes?
- Yeah, why not?

46:45.645 --> 46:48.780
Because it's crazy.
And possibly illegal.

46:48.815 --> 46:50.214
And people will see us.

46:50.250 --> 46:52.517
Don't worry about that.
Come on, it'll be fun.

46:52.552 --> 46:55.286
That's not really my idea
of fun.

46:55.322 --> 46:57.322
Let's get back to work.

47:05.232 --> 47:07.366
We could go to that little
Italian place we love.

47:07.601 --> 47:10.035
It's quick and I only have
an hour before my next class.

47:10.070 --> 47:10.969
Perfect.

47:11.004 --> 47:13.905
- How's the dance coming?
- It's a work in progress.

47:13.941 --> 47:15.507
So is everything.

47:15.542 --> 47:18.410
You're never done, you just
stop revising it.

47:18.445 --> 47:19.711
What's happening with the loan?

47:19.746 --> 47:23.215
I find out soon
if I was approved.

47:23.250 --> 47:26.485
Well, you sound perfectly morose
about it.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.721
Are you having second thoughts
about buying the studio?

47:29.756 --> 47:33.091
If I buy it it's just I don't
have time to do anything else.

47:33.126 --> 47:34.926
It feels like such
a big commitment.

47:34.962 --> 47:36.761
So definitive.

47:36.797 --> 47:39.264
Do you think I gave up
on my dreams too quickly?

47:39.299 --> 47:42.100
I think your dream may have
changed for a little while.

47:42.135 --> 47:45.704
But now it looks like
it might be changing back.

47:45.739 --> 47:49.007
- That happens, you know.
- Right.

47:49.042 --> 47:53.011
But what if I dive in
and it doesn't work out?

47:53.046 --> 47:55.213
When it came to Peter
you took care of yourself

47:55.249 --> 47:56.381
and you walked away,

47:56.416 --> 47:59.851
not from a place of fear
but from a place of strength.

47:59.887 --> 48:03.421
And if I walk away form this it
will be from a place of fear.

48:03.457 --> 48:07.759
Take care of yourself again.
Whatever that means to you.

48:37.925 --> 48:40.792
- That was incredible.
- You think?

48:40.827 --> 48:43.139
I mean, it's better when my
partner's not imaginary, but...

48:43.163 --> 48:44.663
You'd dance circles around him.

48:46.934 --> 48:50.902
It's nice, creating
like this again.

48:50.938 --> 48:54.406
You know, you light up
when you dance like that.

48:54.441 --> 48:58.243
Well, I guess that's what happens
when you do what you love.

49:07.521 --> 49:09.054
I can't believe you beat me.

49:09.089 --> 49:10.856
I gotta get out
on that course more.

49:10.891 --> 49:14.226
You literally golf six days
a week since you retired.

49:15.963 --> 49:20.398
Keeping busy helps us not
to micromanage you and Adriana.

49:20.434 --> 49:23.068
Please, I know you still get
updates on the daily financials.

49:23.103 --> 49:25.871
It's only because I have
a vested interest,

49:25.906 --> 49:27.372
it's not to interfere.

49:27.407 --> 49:29.841
You're doing a fabulous job,
the two of you.

49:29.877 --> 49:31.776
But then again you were trained
by the best.

49:33.113 --> 49:35.514
Hey, that'll be you soon.

49:39.820 --> 49:43.788
I like to see how your life
is falling into place.

49:43.824 --> 49:47.392
Dad, when did you decide you
wanted to work on Wall Street.

49:47.427 --> 49:49.928
I don't think I ever
really decided.

49:49.963 --> 49:54.132
My father always said everyone
in this family works and so I did.

49:54.167 --> 49:57.035
There were no handouts,
no trust funds.

49:57.070 --> 49:59.471
That's why you were never handed
anything, either.

49:59.506 --> 50:02.541
Come on, I had a top-notch
education paid for by you.

50:02.576 --> 50:03.508
Paid for with sweat equity.

50:03.544 --> 50:06.111
You worked for it form the time
you were 15.

50:06.146 --> 50:08.280
Now this company
is your trust fund.

50:08.315 --> 50:11.116
But what if you had wanted
to do something else?

50:11.151 --> 50:13.552
There was nothing else.

50:13.587 --> 50:17.422
My father handed me a gift,
this company.

50:17.457 --> 50:19.124
Sure, we all have hobbies.

50:19.159 --> 50:23.328
I like to play golf but I'm
not about to join the PGA tour.

50:23.363 --> 50:25.163
Senior PGA tour.

50:27.367 --> 50:31.002
No, no. This-this is our place
in the world, Eric.

50:31.038 --> 50:32.203
Our contribution.

50:32.239 --> 50:36.441
I've handed you my legacy
as my father handed it to me.

50:36.476 --> 50:42.097
It's an honor, so be proud of it
and serve it with care, huh?

50:43.150 --> 50:46.918
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

50:46.954 --> 50:49.654
<i>Lift. Yeah.</i>

50:49.690 --> 50:51.256
Give it a try.

50:57.898 --> 50:58.930
<i>Yes.</i>

51:02.069 --> 51:03.368
Like that.

51:03.403 --> 51:05.937
Lovely.

51:05.973 --> 51:08.006
Your work lights up a room.

51:08.041 --> 51:10.275
Well, you know
it's all I ever wanted to do.

51:10.310 --> 51:11.509
I understand.

51:11.545 --> 51:13.278
And as hard as it is
to hang up my hat,

51:13.313 --> 51:16.047
it's evident to me I'm ready.

51:16.083 --> 51:19.684
When it's time to let go
it's revealed to you.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.853
I know you're still waiting
to hear from the bank,

51:21.888 --> 51:23.555
but the other offer.

51:23.590 --> 51:25.690
They're putting pressure on me
for an answer.

51:25.726 --> 51:27.659
I'm gonna need one by Friday.

51:27.694 --> 51:29.160
I'll call the bank
for an update.

51:29.196 --> 51:31.029
Thanks.

51:39.439 --> 51:42.374
And this is where the cocktail
hour will take place.

51:42.409 --> 51:45.910
A string quartet,
passed h'ordeuvres

51:45.946 --> 51:48.847
and three well-staffed bars
around the perimeter.

51:48.882 --> 51:49.948
It's perfect.

51:49.983 --> 51:53.585
I promised you one for the books
and I am delivering.

51:53.620 --> 51:54.786
<i>Now, let's keep moving.</i>

51:54.821 --> 51:57.288
<i>We've got little more than
a week before the big day.</i>

52:02.562 --> 52:06.731
Now, they will expand the dance
floor to accommodate so many guests.

52:06.767 --> 52:09.501
Horseshoe-shaped head table
over there and tables of 12

52:09.536 --> 52:11.202
throughout the rest of the room.

52:11.238 --> 52:13.571
And here is where
your orchestra sits.

52:13.607 --> 52:15.507
- Band.
- I'm sorry?

52:15.542 --> 52:18.176
We're having a band
not an orchestra.

52:20.614 --> 52:21.446
Have you chosen yet?

52:21.481 --> 52:25.784
I've been watching some videos online
but mostly everybody's booked already.

52:25.819 --> 52:27.085
Getting down to the wire here.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.153
I know a great one.

52:28.188 --> 52:31.956
They really only do weddings
for me as a favour.

52:31.992 --> 52:34.392
You two come by in the morning
while they're setting up.

52:34.428 --> 52:36.027
I won't be there yet
but I'll tell them

52:36.063 --> 52:37.106
to give you a little sample.

52:37.130 --> 52:39.397
I can't, the quarterly earnings
come out tomorrow,

52:39.433 --> 52:41.032
but you can choose
without me, Eric.

52:41.068 --> 52:42.567
I trust your taste in music.

52:42.602 --> 52:44.903
OK. I'll drop by
after my dance lesson.

52:44.938 --> 52:48.239
Wonderful. Moving on.
We have to pick tablecloths.

52:48.275 --> 52:51.376
I have seven shades of blue
for you to choose from.

52:51.411 --> 52:54.579
Seven shades of blue?
Did you know seven shades of blue?

52:54.614 --> 52:56.448
Vaguely.

53:07.027 --> 53:08.893
Beautiful.

53:15.702 --> 53:17.736
<i>That was great.</i>

53:26.213 --> 53:28.213
Nice.

53:40.627 --> 53:42.660
That's enough for today.

53:42.696 --> 53:45.830
We'll finish this up later.
Thank you guys so much.

53:47.467 --> 53:49.645
I'm still struggling with the end.
I don't know where to go with it.

53:49.669 --> 53:51.603
Should they end up together?

53:51.638 --> 53:54.506
Do you want people smiling
or crying in the end?

53:54.541 --> 53:58.009
Do they get what they want
in this life or not?

53:58.044 --> 53:59.522
Well, people should get
what they want,

53:59.546 --> 54:02.781
but reality's not always
in sync with that.

54:02.816 --> 54:05.016
But this is a world
you're creating.

54:05.051 --> 54:08.319
How do you want
this love story to end?

54:08.355 --> 54:11.289
I'm gonna think about that
and get back to you.

54:11.324 --> 54:14.492
Alright, enough about me.
Let's get to work.

54:14.528 --> 54:17.228
Are you OK if we take our lesson
on the road?

54:17.264 --> 54:18.463
Where to?

54:18.498 --> 54:21.833
I was thinking maybe a bit
of a practice run is in order.

54:21.868 --> 54:23.513
I thought I was the one
that was supposed to be

54:23.537 --> 54:25.703
changing up the lessons.

54:31.444 --> 54:34.012
They're ready.

54:34.047 --> 54:36.848
This is such an incredible place
to get married.

54:36.883 --> 54:38.349
It's gonna be beautiful.

54:38.385 --> 54:40.685
They're gonna play a few
songs for us.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.487
For me.

54:42.522 --> 54:44.556
And we're gonna get you
used to this dance floor.

54:44.591 --> 54:47.992
That's why I brought
these terrible shoes.

54:48.028 --> 54:51.563
Let's see if you remember
the steps.

54:51.598 --> 54:53.398
I hope they're good.

55:03.810 --> 55:07.245
Make this about you,
not appearances.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.681
Look me in the eyes
and be in the moment.

55:54.995 --> 55:55.894
Why is it so easy with you

55:55.929 --> 55:59.497
and then Adriana comes in
and I'm a mess?

55:59.532 --> 56:02.400
Like I said,
there's no pressure.

56:02.435 --> 56:04.302
Yeah.

56:04.337 --> 56:06.537
That's probably it.

56:12.880 --> 56:13.846
Hello?

56:13.881 --> 56:15.648
This is Hope.

56:15.683 --> 56:17.783
That's great.

56:17.819 --> 56:20.653
Thank you.

56:20.688 --> 56:23.289
I got approved for the loan.

56:23.324 --> 56:25.691
Looks like you have
a decision to make.

56:33.201 --> 56:35.334
...It would definitely cut down
on operating costs.

56:35.369 --> 56:37.036
It's 5:00, we have to go.

56:37.071 --> 56:39.138
We have a dance lesson
and then the cake tasting.

56:39.173 --> 56:41.073
I forgot about the cake tasting.

56:41.109 --> 56:42.875
This is how we get
the wedding we want.

56:42.910 --> 56:45.244
We have to be making these
decisions together.

56:45.279 --> 56:47.580
I picked the band, I
picked the flowers...

56:47.615 --> 56:50.850
I know, and I'm sorry.

56:52.754 --> 56:55.821
But I booked an early dinner
with Eleanor Green.

56:55.857 --> 56:57.389
She might wanna leave the firm.

56:57.425 --> 56:59.358
She might want to
or she's going to?

56:59.393 --> 57:01.338
I don't know, but she's one
of my father's oldest clients.

57:01.362 --> 57:05.264
I want to keep her happy.
You'd do the same.

57:05.299 --> 57:06.443
But I don't wanna leave you
in the lurch.

57:06.467 --> 57:08.601
I'm sorry, I forgot.

57:08.636 --> 57:12.705
I think you should do what's
most important to you.

57:12.740 --> 57:16.242
I need to sit down with Eleanor.

57:16.277 --> 57:19.378
Please understand, Eric.

57:19.413 --> 57:21.380
I do.

57:30.491 --> 57:32.725
I thought Adriana was coming.
Is she meeting you here?

57:32.760 --> 57:34.293
She's not coming.

57:34.328 --> 57:35.973
We haven't had a full rehearsal
with the two of you yet.

57:35.997 --> 57:37.931
- Time is running out.
- I know.

57:37.965 --> 57:39.799
And I'm sorry you changed
your schedule around

57:39.834 --> 57:41.367
to have an afternoon session with us.

57:41.402 --> 57:42.434
That's OK.

57:42.470 --> 57:45.104
We could just rehearse
with the two of us or,

57:45.139 --> 57:47.973
if you're not feeling like it,
we could just call it a day.

57:48.009 --> 57:50.009
You know what,
let's just call it a day.

57:53.481 --> 57:55.948
- Are you hungry?
- Famished, actually.

57:55.983 --> 57:58.350
Good. I know just the place.

58:07.762 --> 58:09.962
The New Yorker
and the Princess Lily.

58:09.997 --> 58:11.831
I can safely say
this is the first time

58:11.866 --> 58:14.600
I've had seven different types
of cake for dinner.

58:14.635 --> 58:17.803
Not me.

58:17.839 --> 58:20.573
I like this one and that one.

58:20.608 --> 58:22.808
Not that one,
Adriana hates coconut.

58:22.844 --> 58:25.244
Definitely the dolce de leche.

58:25.279 --> 58:27.313
How am I supposed
to pick just one?

58:27.348 --> 58:28.659
They will let you have
all of them.

58:28.683 --> 58:31.450
Each layer can be
a different flavour.

58:31.485 --> 58:35.988
- Are you sure about that?
- I happen to know that for a fact.

58:36.023 --> 58:38.157
You did get pretty
far down the road

58:38.192 --> 58:39.859
with your wedding plans,
didn't you?

58:39.894 --> 58:41.660
And I learned a lot
in the process.

58:41.696 --> 58:44.430
For example,
deposits are non-refundable

58:44.465 --> 58:46.276
and there's really no other
appropriate occasion

58:46.300 --> 58:49.001
for a custom wedding dress.

58:49.036 --> 58:50.836
Yeah, I guess not.

58:55.376 --> 58:58.010
This is supposed to be fun, right?

58:58.045 --> 59:01.180
- Planning a wedding, getting married.
- So I hear.

59:06.354 --> 59:10.956
So what made you walk away?
Was it a final incident or something?

59:10.992 --> 59:12.703
Not one thing in particular
but I always said

59:12.727 --> 59:16.295
I wanted to get married once
and I take that very seriously.

59:16.330 --> 59:17.229
Me too.

59:17.265 --> 59:19.031
As I got deeper into
the wedding planning

59:19.066 --> 59:23.535
- I realized this is my once.
- And of course it wasn't.

59:23.571 --> 59:26.405
It's easier to see that now, but
it's tough when you're in it.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.418
And there were some good aspects
to the relationship.

59:28.442 --> 59:31.043
They were just outnumbered.

59:31.078 --> 59:33.345
Did you ever have any regrets?

59:33.381 --> 59:35.214
Not once.

59:35.249 --> 59:38.918
Well, I did offer to pay my dad
back for the venue deposit.

59:38.953 --> 59:41.020
I do regret that a little bit.

59:56.437 --> 59:58.737
Alright, let's try
the other ending.

01:00:14.388 --> 01:00:16.755
- Maybe they should end up together.
- I think so.

01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:18.891
I mean, give this poor couple
what they want.

01:00:18.926 --> 01:00:24.229
- We should all be so lucky, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:00:24.265 --> 01:00:28.033
Alright, you heard the man.
Let's do this ending.

01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:29.702
Thank you.

01:00:32.807 --> 01:00:34.373
Thank you.

01:00:37.244 --> 01:00:42.448
So, the loan paperwork is in
and I have to make a decision.

01:00:42.483 --> 01:00:44.216
Now.

01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:47.319
I mean, if I dive back into
the choreography full force

01:00:47.355 --> 01:00:49.888
then I'm doing it.

01:00:49.924 --> 01:00:52.992
But that means I have to let go
of plan B.

01:00:53.027 --> 01:00:55.594
I don't have enough time
to do both.

01:00:55.629 --> 01:00:57.496
So be it.

01:00:57.531 --> 01:01:02.067
Hope, this is what you love.

01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:04.470
Do you know how lucky you are
to know what you want?

01:01:04.505 --> 01:01:07.639
Not many people have
that kind of clarity.

01:01:07.675 --> 01:01:09.808
That next hand might be
a royal flush.

01:01:22.123 --> 01:01:23.589
You're still here.

01:01:23.624 --> 01:01:25.335
Did you tell the parents
the recital costumes

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.525
will be in next week?

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.360
- I did.
- Great.

01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:32.164
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:01:35.236 --> 01:01:37.970
You're not buying the studio.

01:01:38.005 --> 01:01:40.572
- How'd you know?
- I've known all along.

01:01:40.608 --> 01:01:42.775
I was just waiting for you
to realize it.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:48.614
- Now that I'm choreographing again I...
- It's a leap worth taking.

01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:50.449
I will accept the other offer

01:01:50.484 --> 01:01:53.519
and I will tell them it comes
with an incredible teacher.

01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:56.121
At least until her big
opportunity comes.

01:01:56.157 --> 01:01:59.558
And it will come, whether
it's this week or next year.

01:01:59.593 --> 01:02:02.694
Thank you so much for everything
you've done for me, Sofia.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:06.632
It's my pleasure, Hope.
I can't wait to watch you soar.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.277
Eric?

01:02:17.312 --> 01:02:19.212
Hi.
Did we have a lesson today?

01:02:19.247 --> 01:02:22.920
No. I...
I wanted to drop this off.

01:02:24.719 --> 01:02:26.586
When I knew you were at lunch.

01:02:32.427 --> 01:02:35.495
I just wanted to wish you luck
for tomorrow.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.898
This is so sweet.
Thank you.

01:02:38.934 --> 01:02:40.500
So are you nervous?

01:02:40.535 --> 01:02:46.306
Fluctuating between self-doubt
and crippling panic, so no?

01:02:46.341 --> 01:02:49.275
- Is anyone going with you?
- Flying solo.

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:53.480
- Would you like some moral support?
- Don't you have to be at the office?

01:02:53.515 --> 01:02:57.317
I can go in a bit late.
One benefit of being the boss.

01:02:57.352 --> 01:03:00.353
OK.
I'd love for you to come.

01:03:00.388 --> 01:03:01.988
OK.

01:03:06.394 --> 01:03:08.761
Music.
Where's my music?

01:03:08.797 --> 01:03:13.299
Vanessa has it, remember?
She sent it to you.

01:03:13.335 --> 01:03:14.667
Right.

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:17.670
Another copy of my resume,
check.

01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:20.106
And a bundle of nerves.
Check.

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:21.908
Just relax.
You're ready.

01:03:21.943 --> 01:03:23.610
She would be a fool
not to pick you.

01:03:23.645 --> 01:03:25.311
Excuse me, Hope?

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:27.614
Before we begin I need to check
your availability.

01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:29.616
We'll have to leave by Friday.

01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:31.384
If that doesn't work for you
let me know.

01:03:31.419 --> 01:03:33.353
It works.
It definitely works.

01:03:33.388 --> 01:03:36.389
Great. OK, well let's
get started.

01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:48.428
Really beautiful job, Hope.

01:04:48.463 --> 01:04:50.163
Thank you.

01:04:51.499 --> 01:04:53.166
Thank you.

01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:55.902
Well, I have two more pieces
to see today

01:04:55.937 --> 01:04:58.638
but you'll hear from me
by tonight either way.

01:04:58.673 --> 01:05:00.873
Thank you for the opportunity.

01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:06.980
- That was incredible.
- It felt incredible.

01:05:07.015 --> 01:05:08.392
I don't wanna go back
to the office.

01:05:08.416 --> 01:05:10.750
I really don't wanna go back
to the studio.

01:05:10.785 --> 01:05:12.585
OK, well let's go for a walk.

01:05:12.621 --> 01:05:15.588
- Through the park?
- I have a better idea.

01:05:17.993 --> 01:05:20.126
I wish I could do this every
single working day.

01:05:20.161 --> 01:05:22.462
Take the time to walk
the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:05:22.497 --> 01:05:26.899
Yeah, you occasionally have
a good idea.

01:05:26.935 --> 01:05:29.035
Occasionally, huh?

01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:32.905
You know, I was kinda dreading
my dance lessons.

01:05:32.941 --> 01:05:35.141
- No.
- Believe it.

01:05:35.176 --> 01:05:38.823
But then being out of the office so much,
I really started looking forward to them.

01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:40.647
I told you I'd make a dancer
out of you.

01:05:40.682 --> 01:05:43.349
Let's not overshoot.

01:05:43.385 --> 01:05:46.352
But all of this has kinda made me
look at the world differently.

01:05:46.388 --> 01:05:50.356
I mean, I danced in a pond
in Central Park.

01:05:50.392 --> 01:05:53.793
You danced well in a pond
in Central Park.

01:05:57.666 --> 01:06:00.099
So what does Adriana think
of the new you?

01:06:06.841 --> 01:06:11.311
It feels like Adriana and I
aren't on the same page.

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:12.979
We started dating in our 20's

01:06:13.014 --> 01:06:16.716
and it's been on this fast track
ever since.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:21.354
But I thought getting to this
point would feel different.

01:06:21.389 --> 01:06:24.809
I thought I'd be excited.
And I'm not.

01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:29.562
Well, you two have a lot going on.

01:06:29.597 --> 01:06:32.732
Sometimes when life
gets really stressful

01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:36.502
it's hard to see the light
but it does come back.

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:38.404
It didn't with you
and your fiancé.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:43.209
Well, that's different.
We weren't right for each other.

01:06:43.244 --> 01:06:46.512
Does this maybe have something
to do with the play?

01:06:46.548 --> 01:06:48.348
What do you mean?

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:50.917
I hear the tone of your voice
when you talk about it.

01:06:50.952 --> 01:06:55.888
- Oh yeah? How does it sound?
- It sounds inspired.

01:06:55.924 --> 01:06:59.992
You know, there's a royal flush
in your deck, too.

01:07:09.938 --> 01:07:11.904
Got a minute?

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.541
- We can finish this later.
- Thanks, Gav.

01:07:20.982 --> 01:07:23.583
Are you OK?

01:07:23.618 --> 01:07:26.052
I need to talk to you
about something.

01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:29.922
OK.

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:34.193
I've been thinking a lot
about the company.

01:07:37.065 --> 01:07:40.032
You don't want this anymore.

01:07:40.068 --> 01:07:41.033
I knew it.

01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:43.369
The clients deserve more.

01:07:43.405 --> 01:07:45.905
And you deserve a better
business partner.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.918
Someone who's heart is in it
just as much as yours,

01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:50.376
if not more.

01:07:50.412 --> 01:07:56.104
You and I both know Gavin is
far better suited for this than I am.

01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:02.422
Say something.

01:08:04.092 --> 01:08:07.627
- I want you to be happy.
- I know that.

01:08:07.662 --> 01:08:13.433
And I also know
this is a lot to take in.

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:18.136
- So what're you thinking of doing?
- For starters, producing that play.

01:08:23.377 --> 01:08:26.145
One of the riskiest
investments around.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.680
Not this time.
You should read it.

01:08:28.716 --> 01:08:29.916
It's gonna be worth it.

01:08:29.951 --> 01:08:34.120
I don't have time to read, Eric.
I have a company to run.

01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:37.957
How is this going to look
to our clients?

01:08:37.992 --> 01:08:41.127
What does your father
think of this?

01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:45.078
I haven't told him yet.
I wanted to talk to you first.

01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:49.669
Come on.

01:08:49.703 --> 01:08:52.671
Things aren't gonna be
that different.

01:08:52.707 --> 01:08:57.276
I don't know how
you can say that, Eric.

01:08:57.312 --> 01:08:59.511
This changes everything.

01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:14.260
- So determined today.
- Gotta keep moving.

01:09:14.296 --> 01:09:16.296
Vanessa said she was making
her decision last night

01:09:16.331 --> 01:09:17.563
and I have heard nothing.

01:09:17.599 --> 01:09:18.831
Don't read too much into it.

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:23.303
She said she'd tell you either way
so no news means no news.

01:09:23.337 --> 01:09:24.715
But I can't believe
you didn't ask me to come

01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:29.075
- for moral support.
- Eric offered and I accepted.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:32.979
- OK, I am not even gonna say a word.
- Good. Because he's getting married.

01:09:33.014 --> 01:09:33.779
But what I will say is...

01:09:33.814 --> 01:09:35.747
I knew you couldn't
help yourself.

01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:39.118
I just feel like maybe this is
the first time since Peter

01:09:39.154 --> 01:09:41.921
that you're ready to move on.

01:09:41.956 --> 01:09:44.122
Listen, I don't know what
I'm doing with my life,

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:45.892
personally or professionally,

01:09:45.926 --> 01:09:49.796
but for the first time in a while
I'm OK with that.

01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:51.564
You're up.

01:09:58.507 --> 01:10:01.007
Hi, dad.
Sorry I'm late.

01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:04.144
Mr. Lewis had questions
about changes to his portfolio.

01:10:04.179 --> 01:10:05.345
Some things never change.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.947
Still reading the journal
even in your retirement, huh?

01:10:07.983 --> 01:10:11.251
Old dog, new tricks.
And all of that nonsense.

01:10:11.286 --> 01:10:13.131
You can get that information
online now, you know.

01:10:13.155 --> 01:10:15.488
I like the feel of a real
newspaper in my hands.

01:10:15.524 --> 01:10:17.790
Ink on my fingertips.

01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:20.994
So tell me, what do you need to
talk about that's so important

01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:23.129
I had to skip the back nine?

01:10:23.165 --> 01:10:25.932
Can we speak privately
in my office?

01:10:37.846 --> 01:10:41.526
It's about the company.
I don't think I'm the man for the job.

01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:44.717
- Adriana, absolutely, but me...
- I wouldn't hand you the company

01:10:44.753 --> 01:10:47.153
if I didn't think you could
handle it.

01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:52.014
I can handle it, but the problem is
I don't want to.

01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:57.197
Look, this is new and
it's a big responsibility,

01:10:57.232 --> 01:10:59.265
I understand that
that can be intimidating.

01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:03.436
- I'm not intimidated.
- Then what's the problem?

01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:05.171
It's not what I wanna do
with my life.

01:11:05.207 --> 01:11:06.940
How do you know?
You've barely just begun.

01:11:06.975 --> 01:11:10.210
- It doesn't make me happy.
- Because it's work.

01:11:10.245 --> 01:11:12.478
No one's job makes them happy
every minute of the day.

01:11:12.514 --> 01:11:15.648
I get that, dad, but there's
an opportunity for me,

01:11:15.684 --> 01:11:18.117
a more creative path I really
wanna pursue.

01:11:23.925 --> 01:11:26.359
Eric, we have made assurances
to our clients

01:11:26.394 --> 01:11:28.795
that Gunderson and Grimes
would continue to be

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:32.832
Gunderson and Grimes and now
two months in you wanna walk?

01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:35.969
I know I made a commitment to you,
to Adriana, to the clients...

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:40.452
- What does Adriana have to say?
- She just wants me to be happy.

01:11:42.077 --> 01:11:43.910
You've barely scratched
the surface.

01:11:43.945 --> 01:11:45.990
You have to give it more time
at the very least to give

01:11:46.014 --> 01:11:51.184
our clients a chance to adjust
to all of these changes.

01:11:51.219 --> 01:11:53.853
This is our legacy whether
you're at the helm or not

01:11:53.888 --> 01:11:56.122
and we have to handle it
with care.

01:11:58.793 --> 01:12:00.560
You're right.

01:12:01.863 --> 01:12:04.230
- What if I gave it a year then?
- Good.

01:12:04.266 --> 01:12:07.433
Give it a year,
smooth the transition.

01:12:07.469 --> 01:12:09.402
You never know.

01:12:09.437 --> 01:12:13.373
You might change your mind.

01:12:13.408 --> 01:12:15.408
Who knows?

01:12:18.079 --> 01:12:19.712
Not too much longer.

01:12:19.748 --> 01:12:22.548
Your life's gonna be like
one big vacation soon enough.

01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:23.783
Yes.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.419
Hello?

01:12:26.454 --> 01:12:28.655
Hi, Vanessa.

01:12:31.993 --> 01:12:34.894
My passport is up to date.

01:12:34.929 --> 01:12:37.797
Yes. I'm in.

01:12:37.832 --> 01:12:38.765
I can't wait.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.035
And thank you so much
for believing in me.

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:44.270
OK, I'll see you Friday.

01:12:44.306 --> 01:12:46.073
- You got it.
- I'm going to London!

01:12:46.908 --> 01:12:51.944
Friday? You only have three days!
You better get started packing.

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.081
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:13:09.664 --> 01:13:11.964
Adriana's meeting us here in a few.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.600
Is this considered business casual
in the dance world?

01:13:14.636 --> 01:13:17.837
No, I am actually leaving.

01:13:17.872 --> 01:13:19.739
Sofia's gonna do
your last two lessons.

01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:21.808
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:25.178
- You got it!
- I got it.

01:13:25.213 --> 01:13:26.979
Six months in London.

01:13:27.015 --> 01:13:31.651
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.956
I am so happy for you.

01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:38.324
You worked so hard.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.493
You took a huge risk
and you made this happen.

01:13:40.528 --> 01:13:42.261
Yeah, we're doing it.

01:13:42.297 --> 01:13:46.599
Well, maybe not me.
Not yet.

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:50.970
I told Carlos I'm out.
I made a commitment to the company.

01:13:51.005 --> 01:13:54.640
It might be too much all at once
for the clients if I left.

01:13:54.676 --> 01:13:57.877
I'm sorry.
I know this meant a lot to you.

01:13:57.912 --> 01:14:01.013
It's not the end.
It's just not right now.

01:14:01.049 --> 01:14:05.051
- Soon, maybe.
- Yeah.

01:14:05.086 --> 01:14:08.488
You deserve all the best,
I hope you know that.

01:14:08.523 --> 01:14:11.891
You too.
And I couldn't be happier for you.

01:14:11.926 --> 01:14:15.061
So you're gonna be in good hands
with Sofia for your wedding.

01:14:15.096 --> 01:14:16.062
Yeah.

01:14:16.097 --> 01:14:19.065
Yeah, that's coming up
in a couple days, too.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.834
- I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.
- That's OK.

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:23.703
We've got four videographers.

01:14:23.738 --> 01:14:26.472
I'm sure we'll catch every angle
on film.

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:30.309
I can't wait to watch it.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:34.747
Thanks, Hope.
For everything.

01:14:34.783 --> 01:14:37.016
It was truly my pleasure.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:44.557
So I guess this is goodbye.

01:14:44.592 --> 01:14:47.994
Yeah.
Yeah, this is goodbye.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:51.330
- Thank you, bye.
- Okay. Bye.

01:15:06.381 --> 01:15:07.914
How many scarves?

01:15:07.949 --> 01:15:10.284
To London?
100.

01:15:11.252 --> 01:15:13.953
They're always wearing scarves
in the movies.

01:15:13.988 --> 01:15:16.789
I am so excited for you.

01:15:16.825 --> 01:15:18.224
How do you feel?

01:15:18.259 --> 01:15:19.091
It's all happening so fast

01:15:19.127 --> 01:15:20.927
I don't even have time
to be nervous.

01:15:20.962 --> 01:15:23.095
What time is your flight
to London?

01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:26.065
Do you want me to come
to the airport with you?

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:29.135
It's at 11:00 tonight but my parents
are coming to see me off.

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:33.539
They must be so proud of you.

01:15:33.575 --> 01:15:37.210
- How was it saying goodbye to Eric?
- It was fine.

01:15:37.245 --> 01:15:38.945
I didn't say everything
I wanted to, but...

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.079
What do you mean?

01:15:40.114 --> 01:15:42.248
His business, I wanted to scream
what are you doing?

01:15:42.283 --> 01:15:43.516
You don't want this.

01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:46.719
I just wanted to encourage him
the way that he encouraged me.

01:15:46.754 --> 01:15:49.088
Yeah, but he's gonna have
a wife in a few days.

01:15:49.123 --> 01:15:50.556
That's her job.

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:53.593
Right. And I'm off
on a new adventure.

01:15:53.628 --> 01:15:54.560
Exactly.

01:15:54.596 --> 01:15:57.930
And this is the first
of many shows, Hope.

01:15:57.966 --> 01:15:59.765
You're on your way.

01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:03.569
And who knows what the next
phase of life will bring?

01:16:03.605 --> 01:16:05.771
<i>And one, two, three,
two, two, three,</i>

01:16:05.807 --> 01:16:08.774
three, two, three,
four, two, three,

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:12.645
five, two, three,
turn, turn, turn.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.748
OK, OK.
Let's stop.

01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:18.017
You're young, you're in love,

01:16:18.052 --> 01:16:20.486
you're about to pledge your
lives to each other on Saturday

01:16:20.522 --> 01:16:23.856
and you did not look into
each other's eyes one time.

01:16:23.892 --> 01:16:27.293
I know the steps. I get the steps,
but it just isn't working.

01:16:27.328 --> 01:16:30.363
- Maybe we shouldn't do the dance.
- Now you tell me this?

01:16:30.398 --> 01:16:32.476
The spread in the Times,
the pictures of our rehearsal

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.767
teasing this big dance
and you wanna cancel it?

01:16:34.802 --> 01:16:36.447
Maybe we just aren't meant
to dance with each other.

01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:39.717
- Some people aren't dancers.
- I've been saying this since April.

01:16:39.741 --> 01:16:42.475
Let's not do anything rash.

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:45.211
A wedding is a time that
can test one's patience.

01:16:45.246 --> 01:16:46.212
Maybe we should call it a day

01:16:46.247 --> 01:16:49.482
and start again tomorrow
for our final lesson.

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:51.684
OK.

01:17:04.266 --> 01:17:06.478
- You're here.
- I came straight from the airport,

01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:08.735
I thought you might wanna
get started right away.

01:17:09.638 --> 01:17:10.804
Thank you again, Vanessa.

01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:12.517
You're gonna stop thanking me
when you see how much work

01:17:12.541 --> 01:17:14.575
we have to do with
this accelerated schedule.

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:17.110
- I'm up for the task.
- I know you are.

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:20.247
- Let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

01:17:20.282 --> 01:17:23.150
Welcome to the Alexander
Pope Theater.

01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:17.170
- Do you mind if we have a minute?
- Yeah, of course.

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.274
Thanks.

01:18:30.219 --> 01:18:33.453
You are one of the most
important people in my life.

01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:35.489
You know that, right?

01:18:35.524 --> 01:18:39.593
OK.
What's going on?

01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:46.900
I know why there's a disconnect
on the dance floor,

01:18:46.935 --> 01:18:52.873
off the dance floor.

01:18:52.908 --> 01:18:56.576
Because it's not right.

01:18:56.612 --> 01:18:58.812
We are not right for each other.

01:18:58.847 --> 01:19:04.551
- We don't speak the same language.
- We don't want the same things.

01:19:04.586 --> 01:19:08.689
Then why are we getting married?

01:19:08.724 --> 01:19:10.524
I don't know.

01:19:13.696 --> 01:19:17.030
You're the most important person
on the planet to me

01:19:17.066 --> 01:19:21.702
but I'm relieved.

01:19:21.737 --> 01:19:26.273
It all got so out of hand.

01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:30.544
I didn't... I didn't want
to admit to myself or to you

01:19:30.579 --> 01:19:33.584
that we were making a mistake.

01:19:36.819 --> 01:19:40.420
I didn't want to disappoint anyone.

01:19:40.456 --> 01:19:42.522
I didn't either.

01:19:50.054 --> 01:19:53.699
So we're not getting married.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:59.306
Are you staying
with the company?

01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:01.475
I don't wanna do anything
to hurt the company.

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:04.978
I know this is your dream.

01:20:05.113 --> 01:20:12.185
You deserve to be happy in work,
in life, in love.

01:20:12.955 --> 01:20:15.655
Yeah.

01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:17.457
And so do you.

01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:26.440
I think I might have a way for us
to both get what we want here.

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:29.970
I'm listening.

01:20:34.409 --> 01:20:41.114
And one, two, three,
four, five, six,

01:20:41.183 --> 01:20:43.283
seven, eight.

01:20:43.318 --> 01:20:48.021
One, two, three, and four.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:50.624
Really nice run you guys,
thank you.

01:20:50.659 --> 01:20:52.759
Alright, that's enough
for today.

01:20:52.795 --> 01:20:53.827
Get some rest, everyone.

01:20:53.862 --> 01:20:57.864
We'll hit it again tomorrow
morning, 9 am sharp.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.999
Nice work today, Hope.

01:20:59.034 --> 01:21:01.434
I love what you've brought
to the opening back, too.

01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:02.369
Thank you.

01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:06.273
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

01:21:06.308 --> 01:21:09.943
<i>Excuse me.
My name is not on the list, but...</i>

01:21:19.188 --> 01:21:22.155
Eric, what are you doing
in London?

01:21:22.191 --> 01:21:23.723
I'm scouting a bit.

01:21:23.759 --> 01:21:26.493
I heard this was a good one,
though you need better security.

01:21:26.528 --> 01:21:28.195
Anyone can just walk in here.

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.997
What're you talking about?
What is going on?

01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:34.301
A new creative investments
division of Gunderson and Grimes.

01:21:34.336 --> 01:21:37.549
I run it, while Adriana and Gavin
run the financial advisory side.

01:21:37.573 --> 01:21:41.341
That's incredible.
Where is Adriana?

01:21:41.376 --> 01:21:43.376
Shouldn't you guys be
on your honeymoon?

01:21:43.412 --> 01:21:45.579
You see, there's this thing
that happened.

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:48.348
I thought I was doing everything
I was supposed to do.

01:21:48.383 --> 01:21:49.828
Marrying the girl I was supposed
to marry,

01:21:49.852 --> 01:21:51.585
following in my father's
footsteps...

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.887
- You didn't get married.
- No.

01:21:53.922 --> 01:21:56.022
We both agreed it wasn't right.

01:21:56.058 --> 01:21:59.092
We'd been going through
the motions for a while.

01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:01.428
And so I'm here.

01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:04.030
Aside from scouting we're gonna
be workshopping Carlos's play

01:22:04.066 --> 01:22:05.532
on the West End.

01:22:05.567 --> 01:22:07.334
I'll be going back and forth, a lot.

01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:09.269
And then next stop Broadway
in six months.

01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:13.807
- That's about the same time I go back.
- Well, what a coincidence.

01:22:16.044 --> 01:22:18.044
You know, it's funny.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.880
One day I stepped
onto this dance floor,

01:22:19.915 --> 01:22:25.218
which you know I hate,
and everything changed.

01:22:25.254 --> 01:22:27.354
Suddenly I looked forward
to dancing.

01:22:27.389 --> 01:22:28.622
No, you didn't.

01:22:29.758 --> 01:22:34.194
OK, maybe it's just the part where
I got to have you in my arms.

01:22:36.965 --> 01:22:42.936
But also I found the inspiration
I needed because I watched you,

01:22:42.971 --> 01:22:45.639
and I wanted to thank you
for that.

01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:49.142
Underneath all those layers of
obligation and responsibility

01:22:49.177 --> 01:22:51.912
I found myself,

01:22:51.947 --> 01:22:56.249
and it's so clear
what I want now.

01:22:56.285 --> 01:22:59.486
What is that?

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:00.553
You.

01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:06.059
Dance with me?

01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:13.333
