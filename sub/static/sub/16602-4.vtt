WEBVTT

00:09.543 --> 00:11.212
Oh, my God.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.381
That's remarkable.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.849
And wh-- where does
my chin go?

00:15.916 --> 00:19.320
Okay, we're gonna do
 a little trimming
 on the jaw line there.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.021
- Okay. You like that?
 - Yeah.

00:21.089 --> 00:24.892
And then we do
 a little liposuction
 around the neck.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.594
That's fantastic.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.530
- It's cool, huh?
 - Yeah.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.299
I'd like to donate
 my excess skin to research.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.403
Whoo.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.071
Wow. So I will
 look like that?

00:37.138 --> 00:38.306
Yes, you will.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.575
Beautiful.
 Beautiful.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.744
So, okay.
 We move forward and, uh,

00:43.811 --> 00:47.115
I just need a note
 from your therapist.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.949
Well, I'm not in therapy.
 Not right now.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.151
Not at present.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.785
I-- I was told
 by my physician

00:51.852 --> 00:54.388
that I didn't need
 a note... for this.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.924
That's true for the, uh--
 for the hormones.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.993
But for the surgery,
 we still require

01:00.060 --> 01:02.330
a letter
 from someone who has
 a PhD in psychology

01:02.396 --> 01:05.533
just to make sure
 you meet the requirements
 for the procedure.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.702
I have to ask
 another person
 for permission?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.705
Yeah, it, uh,
 just covers us
 for malpractice.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.941
And, uh, my-- my vagina?
 Is that--

01:14.007 --> 01:15.276
Vaginoplasty.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.544
- My vaginoplasty--
- Vaginoplasty.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.679
That's yet another
 procedure?

01:18.746 --> 01:21.749
That's exactly right.
That's a whole separate
procedure.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.052
If at all possible,
 I prefer not to be
 anesthetized

01:25.119 --> 01:26.387
more than necessary.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.021
Do I really
 need to go under,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.323
uh, yet again?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.825
It's a major surgery,

01:31.892 --> 01:33.927
and there is significant
 recovery time on that.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.297
Plus, we need to have
 a specialist onboard.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.999
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.968
Yeah. It's exciting.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.270
It is exciting.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.338
Can I have, um--

01:44.405 --> 01:46.407
Can I have a printout
 of that?

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.061 --> 02:42.196
- Anything, honey?

02:42.263 --> 02:44.465
- No.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.400
- Honey, you have to relax.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.836
- I can't!
It hurts.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.104
Well, but that's 'cause
 you're not relaxing.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.707
You have to relax
 and you have to push
 at the same time.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.278
How do I do that?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.812
Is anything coming out?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.047
No!

03:01.315 --> 03:04.017
You have to bear down,

03:04.084 --> 03:06.019
and let go
 at the same time.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.322
- It's too big.
 - Okay. All right.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.523
- I'm coming in there.
 - No!

03:17.798 --> 03:18.866
Mornin'.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.701
Hey.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.270
What's up?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.537
Not much.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.544
Coffee mugs in there.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.353
Whatcha lookin' for?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.788
Juice.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.992
OJ.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.394
Mm. Oh.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.933
She likes
 an ice cube in hers.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.374
Um, she still in bed?

04:00.441 --> 04:01.809
- Last I checked.
 - Okay.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.117
- Chasin' me?

04:10.183 --> 04:11.051
You got a girlfriend?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.786
No.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.222
Well, that's a shame.
You are a considerate dude.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.491
Thank you very much.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.226
- Morning, Gator.
 - Hi, Yoshi.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.062
- Hi.
 - Thank you.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.297
What ya readin'?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.466
For school.
 What are you doing today?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.935
Um, let's put in
 the tomatoes and the basil.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.670
Yes, that's what I
 wanted to hear.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.673
- Let's do that shit.
- So, um, I'm taking off.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.809
What? No. What?
 No, no, no, please.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.711
No, no, no, no, no.
 Please stay.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.848
Five more minutes.
 Five more minutes.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.016
- Bye.
- Come snuggle.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.785
Please
 come back to bed.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.454
See ya.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.323
Come to bed.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.124
I did not know that
 your brother was at home.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.960
He's always at home
these days.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.261
I'm sorry.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.697
I'm bare assed
 under here.

04:56.764 --> 05:00.401
I'm sorry.
 Did he scare you off?

05:00.468 --> 05:03.203
It was a little awkward.

05:03.270 --> 05:07.375
- Climb that hill,
 mama.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.677
You got it.
 Four.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.913
Three. Two.
 Back in the saddle.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.017
Now give it all you've got.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.688
Dig into that part of you
 that yearns to feel powerful,

05:20.754 --> 05:23.757
beautiful and free.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.794
Touch that inner light
and let it shine bright.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.097
Now say it.
 Shine bright.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.399
- Shine bright!

05:31.465 --> 05:33.601
- Shine bright!
- Shine bright!

05:33.667 --> 05:36.036
- Brighter!
- Brighter!

05:41.041 --> 05:42.042
Woo!

05:47.748 --> 05:49.950
- Bye, Una.
 - Bye.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.585
Such a great class.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.454
- Thanks for coming.
 - Yeah.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.356
Yes, fantastic.
 Shining bright.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.059
- Woo!

05:59.126 --> 06:01.895
Hey, I wanted to
 introduce myself
 to you, actually.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.532
I'm, um--
 I'm Sarah Pfefferman.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.868
I'm Len's ex wife,

06:07.935 --> 06:10.237
and, uh, I, of course,
 live with him now.

06:10.303 --> 06:14.608
I-- I'm a huge fan.
 I'm just a huge fan
 of yours.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.343
Seriously.
 You make him so happy,

06:16.410 --> 06:18.646
and that's really
 important, you know,

06:18.712 --> 06:20.247
to the-- our whole
 configuration.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.684
- So, I just--
 - Wow, that is
 really cool of you.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.153
Len told me
how cool you were,
but, wow.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.689
- He did?
 - Yeah. Thank you.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.257
You guys are such
 an inspiration.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.566
Can I ask you something?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.568
I'm sorry.
 I-- I know you're just--

06:40.634 --> 06:42.736
Like, what is
 the attraction?
 You know?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.505
I mean, I get
 why he wants you,

06:44.572 --> 06:47.508
but that?
 Like, Len?

06:47.575 --> 06:52.112
I mean, he's, like, 43,
 and you're, like, 20--
 I don't know, 8?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.981
- 22.
 - 22?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.483
Yeah.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.520
I just-- I like dating
 older guys.

06:59.587 --> 07:03.123
It's like a daddy thing?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.892
It's kind of like
 a Len thing.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.862
He's just--
He's so present
and attentive,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
and I just feel
safe with him.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.633
He's so great.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.269
It was so great
to meet you.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.639
- You, too.
 - I can't wait
 to tell him.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.407
- I'll see you soon.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.710
- I hope you come back.
- Of course.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.644
Bye.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.549
Can't you ditch work?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.918
No, I've got
 a faculty lunch.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.520
It's gonna suck.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.031
Wait. Uh, I want to
tell you something
before you go.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.132
Yeah?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.736
I think I cheated.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.106
Oh, Sprout,
you know that--

07:53.173 --> 07:55.375
You know you have
 the freedom to do whatever.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.178
It was with Aubree.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.479
T.A. Aubree?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.481
We were just--

08:01.549 --> 08:05.519
We were in the office
 and then just having
 a back and forth,

08:05.586 --> 08:07.688
and it was normal
 and weird, but normal,

08:07.755 --> 08:10.758
and then, you know,
then my hand was
in her pants.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.362
You were talking
and your hand wound up
in her twat.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.998
More or less, yes,
 and-- and if you'd
 been there,

08:18.065 --> 08:20.167
then you would agree that
 it would have been very rude

08:20.233 --> 08:23.537
for me to take it out
before she orgasmed.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.774
Which was really fast.
 It was like weirdly fast,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.276
like premature
 ejaculation fast,
 it was--

08:30.944 --> 08:32.011
Yikes.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.120
Are you jealous?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.858
Um, I'm mainly disappointed

08:44.925 --> 08:48.128
that you gave someone
a co-dependent orgasm.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.598
I--

08:54.935 --> 08:57.104
I want you to be jealous.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.241
I know that
we have our thing,

09:01.308 --> 09:03.611
and I totally appreciate
 your rejection of--

09:03.677 --> 09:05.946
of traditional
 romantic relationships

09:06.013 --> 09:08.015
from a socio-political
 standpoint,

09:08.081 --> 09:09.549
and I-- and I agree,
 and, um--

09:09.617 --> 09:12.085
but I just--

09:12.152 --> 09:15.322
I really,
 really like you.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.158
A lot,
 and I don't like
 having to pretend,

09:18.225 --> 09:19.693
and I don't want to,
 and I just-- I--

09:19.760 --> 09:22.930
I'm not comfortable
with it, I realize,

09:22.996 --> 09:25.733
and if that's what you need,
 then I don't...

09:25.799 --> 09:29.703
know what to say.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.706
Oh.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.777
I-- I didn't know
 that you-- you felt so--

09:36.844 --> 09:39.947
I do.
I feel so, um--

10:06.206 --> 10:08.341
I was thinking, like,
maybe we could

10:08.408 --> 10:10.443
do something
 a little different today.

10:10.510 --> 10:14.614
Yeah. What's that?
 Something new?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.384
Like a whole new...

10:17.450 --> 10:19.820
scenario.

10:19.887 --> 10:23.256
Like, I play your part,
 you play my part.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.026
You want to top me?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.595
Yes.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.597
Sarah Pfefferman.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.465
I didn't know
 you were a switch.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.668
Just thought
 it might be fun.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.105
Sure. We'll have to do
 a quick contract.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.907
Verbal is okay.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.642
You should know
I have hard limits.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.411
What's your safe word?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.312
Red.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.984
Can I use
 the thing in the bathroom
 with the big horns?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.653
You're the one
who's paying.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.288
Lie down, bitch.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.190
Ha! Just kidding.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.391
Totally kidding.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.659
I'll be right back.

11:02.195 --> 11:06.867
First John 4:19 says
 that we love

11:06.934 --> 11:09.269
because he loved us first.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.105
Now, as babies,
 we're born into this world

11:12.172 --> 11:16.443
that's filled with
 bitterness and hatred
 and sin.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.012
And in our first breath,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.714
we're given love.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.250
No matter what we do,

11:23.316 --> 11:25.518
or how far we stray,

11:25.585 --> 11:27.654
the Lord loves us.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.889
Wow.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.257
Think about that
 for a second.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.458
He really loves the Lord.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.426
Because of the
 heavenly father...

11:33.493 --> 11:36.463
I've been trying to download
 this for a whole week.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.566
It's on your desk top,
 so you can watch it
 whenever you want.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.336
I just--

11:43.403 --> 11:46.506
I just really miss him.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.209
Um, I miss him, too.
 I do.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.915
So, I have something
 to show you.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.250
- Okay. All right.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.188
I don't know if you noticed
 how clean the place is.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.656
Yeah. No, it looks
great in here.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.526
Yeah, well,
 I just started
 some new medication.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.096
At first,
 I couldn't sleep at all.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.064
Then I got a whole lot of
 cleaning done,

12:11.131 --> 12:14.968
more in one day
than I ever did
in ten years.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.806
I think I got rid of
 all of my anger at
 the Bush administration.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.140
That thing?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.409
- You still got
that thing.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.312
- Oh, my God.
 - So have a seat.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.280
- Okay.
 - I was mucking out,

12:27.347 --> 12:30.951
and I found
 this little gem.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.692
* We can make it
 in another world *

12:39.759 --> 12:43.330
You wrote that for me.
 You remember?

12:44.965 --> 12:47.634
* And time is not
 a number on a wall *

12:47.700 --> 12:52.039
* And the wall doesn't keep
 what is yours from mine *

12:52.105 --> 12:53.540
* We can make it
 in another wo-- *

12:55.075 --> 12:56.910
That is--

12:56.977 --> 12:58.445
That's insane.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.151
We made a beautiful boy.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.454
Yeah.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.492
Um, I know stuff
 didn't work out

13:12.559 --> 13:15.128
the way you
 probably wanted.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.565
And I have been
 thinking about this a lot.

13:18.631 --> 13:23.270
And, um, you were--
 you were young, too.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.808
But I did want to say that

13:28.876 --> 13:32.846
I-- I forgive you.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.031
Thank you.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.432
I mean it.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.370
Uh...

14:03.043 --> 14:04.878
You don't want that?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.846
It's yours.

14:06.914 --> 14:07.948
Take it.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.852
I don't need it anymore.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.890
Well, well, well.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.658
What do we got here?

14:18.725 --> 14:21.962
I woke up like this.
 I don't know what happened.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.231
Can you--
 Can you help me?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.798
Go ahead.
Go ahead, go ahead.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.833
Can you help me?

14:26.900 --> 14:29.469
You need help?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.671
You know, I'm sorry,
 just-- I can't--

14:31.738 --> 14:33.806
It's like I've gotten
 totally in my head.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.708
Can we just--
 Can I just be me
 and you be you?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.344
Yes, ma'am.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.746
Please don't call me ma'am.
I hate ma'am.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.183
- Can you do boss?
 - Yes, boss.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.517
Yeah, I like boss.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.722
Did you hear that?

14:49.789 --> 14:52.159
- Did you?
 - Yes, boss.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.994
Next one's
gonna hit you.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.628
Where do you think
 it's gonna hit?

14:55.695 --> 14:57.430
Huh? Where do you think?

14:57.497 --> 15:02.002
Where do you think?
 You think it might be
 your ass?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.503
Maybe I'll hit your face.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.506
Would that be good?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.341
Maybe your cunt.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.244
Would that be good?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.083
Ow.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.418
Oh, does that hurt?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.887
Shut up, you stupid,
 fucking twat!

15:20.954 --> 15:22.655
You know what I should do?

15:22.722 --> 15:25.058
I should beat
the shit out of you.
That's what I should do.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.260
I should fucking cut off
your fucking head!

15:27.327 --> 15:29.362
- Red.
- And piss down
your throat--

15:29.429 --> 15:30.630
- Red.
 - You ugly, fucking cunt!

15:30.697 --> 15:32.132
Red!

15:46.113 --> 15:48.115
I can't believe you're
 playing hooky for me.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.117
- It's so sexy.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.052
I can't quite believe
 I'm doing it, either,

15:52.119 --> 15:54.354
but it is so worth it.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.890
Oof.
 Ow, my pussy hurts.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.627
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.262
You really needed it, huh?

16:02.329 --> 16:06.299
Yeah,
but I think it was just
a little too hard.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.602
Oh. Okay.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.705
Well, you could have
 said something.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.444
Oh, well, I--
 I just did.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.113
In the moment.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.682
Well, you had your whole
daddy thing going on.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.651
You were so focused.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.486
It would have been rude.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.991
Permission
 to speak frankly?

16:34.694 --> 16:35.595
Uh-oh.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.469
I have noticed
 this thing about you.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.972
That shit with Aubree
 and how it works with us.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.476
Your body from
 the neck down is zonked.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.478
- Zonked?
 - Zonked.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.679
No, it's not.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.314
There's a disconnect
 happening.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.683
You go to the Caribbean
or somewhere.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.319
Yeah, I mean,
 sometimes I go to...

16:59.386 --> 17:01.154
a dreamy place.
 It's relaxing.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.955
It's like when you
 get in your car, you know,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.525
and you start driving
 and you just let your
 mind wander,

17:05.592 --> 17:06.826
and then you end up
 on La Brea,

17:06.893 --> 17:08.461
and you don't even know
 how you got there.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.864
Okay, well,
 one person's dream space

17:11.931 --> 17:13.833
is another person's
disassociating.

17:13.900 --> 17:18.171
What?
 Oh, come on.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.240
Come on, are you gonna
 pull out the DSM now,

17:20.307 --> 17:23.041
and fucking diagnose me?

17:23.109 --> 17:25.044
What are you gonna do now,
 critique my orgasm?

17:25.112 --> 17:27.780
Okay, well, you get
kinda high pitched,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.216
and I-- I feel like
 you could ride it better

17:29.282 --> 17:30.250
if you stayed
in your base.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.219
Excuse me?

17:32.285 --> 17:34.454
It was a joke.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.323
Come however
you want, baby,

17:36.389 --> 17:39.058
you are my songbird.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.893
This is weird.
 I don't want to do

17:40.960 --> 17:42.495
a post game
 on our fucking.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.764
- I don't like it.
 - Why not?

17:44.831 --> 17:47.100
It is supposed to be
 a collective experience.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.002
There is a difference between
 fucking and making love.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.405
Eww. Don't say that.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.477
I-- Can we
 talk about it later?

17:57.544 --> 18:00.247
I have to--
 I just-- this girl...

18:00.313 --> 18:03.450
is an idiot and
 I have to grade her paper.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.061
Yeah, so he'll hold it for,
 you know, a week.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.363
It's longer than that,
 actually.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.298
Yeah, it's been
 over a week and--

18:18.365 --> 18:20.333
I mean, he completely
resists every time.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.503
And then, you know,
 afterwards, he'll just

18:23.570 --> 18:25.638
crap his brains out,

18:25.705 --> 18:28.975
which, I'm sure,
 is a psychological thing.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.178
- 'cause no kid likes to poop.
 - Yeah, obviously it's
 a psychological thing.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.645
Have you talked to
 Zack's pediatrician?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.747
We have a kit
 that we brought,

18:34.814 --> 18:37.317
um, to sort of help
 with the process.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.552
- It's got, um--
 We put it in his cubby.
 - Yeah, I mean--

18:39.619 --> 18:41.621
- If you could help--
- There's, like, a box--

18:41.688 --> 18:43.523
'Cause if you--
 There's gonna be
 wet wipes, uh,

18:43.590 --> 18:45.925
there's a thumb drive
 with a play list of songs

18:45.992 --> 18:47.227
that are relaxing.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.028
It's got a little
 footstool.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.631
- Squatty Potty, to elevate--
 - So, yeah, that he can squat.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.133
And then he can
 just eliminate.
 It's better for you.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.903
Miss Downey,
 if you could just sort of
 go in there with the kit,

18:56.969 --> 18:59.606
and like, you know,
 hang out, set up,
 and kind of just--

18:59.672 --> 19:01.808
You know, sort of
 normalize the ritual.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.244
Typically, we don't
 accompany students
 to the restroom.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
But if when you do,
 you can't make a big deal
 out of it, though.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.281
because that's just gonna
 tense him right back up.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.916
Like, you just have to be,
like, you know, we're here,

19:09.982 --> 19:12.151
we're hangin' out,
if something happens,
something happens.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.421
Just an idea.
 Could it be that

19:14.487 --> 19:16.989
with your re-imagined
 family structure,

19:17.056 --> 19:19.459
that Zack might be feeling
 a little bit powerless.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.627
He's fine with it.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.463
Of course.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.032
What the fuck!

19:26.098 --> 19:28.701
Are we why
 Zacky's not pooping.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.738
No. No way.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.574
We're great co-parents.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.875
This works.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.549
I'm gonna go to Gelson's
 and pick up the prunes
 and the chia seeds,

19:42.615 --> 19:46.919
and can you come get
 the Squatty Potty
 after school?

19:46.986 --> 19:50.390
It's my off night.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.358
What, you have plans?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.293
Yeah.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.695
- With Una?
- Yeah, but it's been on
the calendar--

19:55.762 --> 19:57.430
- What? That's totally fine.
 - And I got you all next week.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.565
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm all next week.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.633
- I've got you.
- Okay.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.502
Are they tearing down
 the gym?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.304
I think they found some
 asbestos or something.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.873
Nothin' maj.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.308
I'm gonna take off.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.976
All right.
 See ya later.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.451
- Look at that.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.386
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Maura, that's amazing.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.254
Thank you.
 I'm very happy with it.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.624
But this,
this is just--
just shaving.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.791
- And this is--
 - Do you know what's great?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.593
It looks like you.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.861
That's what's great.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.563
- I really love it.
 - May I?

21:07.166 --> 21:10.069
Oh, see.
 Now that's what I'm
 talking about, right?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.404
- The contouring.
 - Mm-hm.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.339
You are gonna be
 so fish.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.940
Beautiful.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.275
Dr. Benoit says
 I have to get
 yet another note--

21:16.343 --> 21:17.644
- Mm-hm.
 - From a psychologist

21:17.710 --> 21:20.380
I don't--
I don't have
a psychologist.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.281
That is the
 least Jewish thing
 you've ever said.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.751
Okay. Look.
 You have to know this.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.586
To get the note,
you have to follow
a script.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.554
Okay.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.322
I hate my penis.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.758
I'm a woman trapped
in a man's body.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.226
You know,
 I'm not gonna be happy
 unless I get tits.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.796
- Okay. Yeah.
 - Like that.

21:36.863 --> 21:37.697
Okay. All right.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.599
Vicki, have you
seen this?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.934
Oh, I've seen it.
 I-- I can draw it
 from memory.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.203
- Have you seen this before?
 - I don't think the waiter's
 seen it, though.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.305
- Waiter.
 - I've been over zealous.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.341
No, but that made--
 that makes perfect sense.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.643
- Because it's important.
 - And it's a big deal.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.044
I know it's
 a big deal.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.980
I'm still
 negotiating this.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.583
- Okay, here we go.
 It's show time.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.587
* You take the good,
 you take the bad *

22:00.653 --> 22:02.121
* You take 'em both
 and there you have *

22:02.188 --> 22:05.091
* The facts of life,
 the facts of life *

22:05.157 --> 22:07.860
* There's a time you gotta go
 and show you're growin' *

22:07.927 --> 22:10.329
* Now you know about
 the facts of life *

22:10.397 --> 22:11.998
* The facts of life

22:12.064 --> 22:14.333
Uh, Sarah. Hi.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.635
- Hey. In here.
- Is this it?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.237
- Hi.
 - Hi.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.706
Oh, my God,
 you're here.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.274
- Wow. Hey.
 - Okay.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.743
Who's this
 little peanut?

22:23.810 --> 22:25.578
Uh, this is
 my daughter Idit.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.014
Hey, Edeeth.
 Nice to meet you.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.516
- Hi.
- Idit.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.519
- Idith. Edith.
Edith? Idit.
- Sure, sure.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.753
- Tough one.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.988
Okay, so here--
here's my idea.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.591
So remember we were having
 that whole conversation

22:38.658 --> 22:41.060
about how I needed,
 you know, my own space,

22:41.127 --> 22:44.597
my own way into
 my spiritual whatever,

22:44.664 --> 22:45.932
- and-- and I--
- Yes.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.635
I really feel like
 this is the space.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.071
I was referring to
 the space inside yourself.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.540
What? That's what
 you were-- meant?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.908
- Yes.
- I thought--
Oh, my God.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.376
- It is a beautiful gym.
 - A beautiful gym, though.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.078
Yeah.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.748
Uh, but I-- I actually
 don't know about the idea.

23:01.814 --> 23:02.849
I'm so sorry.
 Tell us.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.116
All right,
 okay, okay, okay.

23:04.183 --> 23:07.920
I-- this--
 What I was imagining was, um,

23:07.987 --> 23:10.790
like a Tacos Con Torah
 night.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.525
Picture it in your head,
you-- you come in,

23:12.592 --> 23:13.960
and there's, like,
you know,

23:14.026 --> 23:16.195
votives in paper bags
 lining the steps.

23:16.262 --> 23:19.699
You move over here,
 you're awash in golden
 votive light.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.635
And there's
inflatable bean bags
all around in a circle,

23:22.702 --> 23:25.337
and-- and we got, like,
the taco guy over there.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.474
And then
 right in the center,
 we have the--

23:27.540 --> 23:29.241
the Torah box
 right here.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.443
- It's the ark.
- The ark!

23:30.510 --> 23:32.011
That's right.
 That's right.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.746
I was gonna ask you,
 do you have, like,
 travel arks,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.748
like, mobile arks?
 We'll have, like,
 a travel ark

23:35.815 --> 23:37.817
in the middle of
 all the hipster Jews.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.752
You know,
 music and food and--

23:39.819 --> 23:41.454
- Hmm.
 - Communion.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.055
And I talked to
 the school already,

23:43.122 --> 23:44.090
and they said
 we can have the space
 as long as we get,

23:44.156 --> 23:45.224
like, asbestos waivers.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.759
You t-- okay.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.061
- I mean.
 - Oh, my God, Raquel.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.532
- This is--
 - What?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.000
Raquel had this idea
 in school

23:54.066 --> 23:57.169
- for a temple without walls.
 - Wait a second.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.405
- Wait.
 - This is her idea.

23:59.472 --> 24:02.675
You had this idea.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.978
I had so many
 big stupid ideas

24:06.045 --> 24:07.714
- in seminary.
 - It's not a stupid idea.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.749
- This is--
- It's a great idea,
it's a stupid name.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.151
- But it's a great idea.
- It's a stupid name.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.654
- Okay.
- Hold on, let me find
my hellcat.

24:14.721 --> 24:18.558
- Idit!

24:19.692 --> 24:21.093
What is that?
 That's so cute.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.395
It means "here I am"
 in Biblical Hebrew.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.131
- I love Hebrew.
- It's so great.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.333
.. Hineni-- Hin--
 Here I am.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.468
- Yeah, she's--
 - Here I-- Hineni.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.604
- H ineni. Here I am.
 - Yes.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.339
- That's the name of it.
- The name of it.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.474
That's the name.
 That's the name
 of the event.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.043
Or the-- the ceremony.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.612
- Hineni. Here I am.
 - Oh, my goodness.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.213
Here I am.
 That's what we'll
 call this.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.782
Here I am.
 Hineni.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.160
You make fun of me.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.128
You call me kid.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.230
And that makes me
 feel rotten.

24:59.732 --> 25:03.002
Well, we're sorry
 if we made you feel bad.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.771
- Well, that doesn't matter.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.039
You did. You know?

25:07.106 --> 25:09.175
Come here.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.644
So, do you actually
 hate your penis?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.816
- But at least
 I got my foot in the door.
 - No.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.918
- But you guys keep
 slammin' it on me.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.388
- Some best friend I am.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.023
Do you hate my penis?

25:24.090 --> 25:26.258
Of course not.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.928
I'm happy to work with
 whatever you've got.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.763
- We gotta tell Mrs. G.
 that it's our fault.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.700
- If Tootie
 gets expelled,

25:33.766 --> 25:36.102
- we should all
get expelled.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.270
- Now, doesn't that
 seem a little--

25:38.337 --> 25:39.672
You gonna be okay?

25:47.747 --> 25:49.348
Let's promise to be there
for each other.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.183
- No matter what.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.385
- Promise.
