WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.534
<i> Previously on</i>Scorpion...
I am running

00:01.535 --> 00:03.068
for the 16th district alderman

00:03.070 --> 00:05.137
of west altadenia

00:05.139 --> 00:06.271
in the local upcoming election.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.206
I'm your campaign manager, now.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.108
What? Why?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.709
'Cause I care about you, kid.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.011
You look beautiful.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.112
Well, thank you.
I am excited

00:13.114 --> 00:14.046
to meet your parents.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.047
You should've taken my mom

00:15.049 --> 00:16.548
dancing when you had the chance.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.385
We could have been
partners forever.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.455
Paige, just hear me out.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.723
How does Ms. Franklin
know your name?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.725
Her last name is not
Franklin, it's dineen.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.061
My mother is a con woman.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.030
A first-degree grifter.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.297
Would you like to
meet your grandson?

00:32.299 --> 00:34.133
I'd like that very much.

00:35.302 --> 00:38.137
It's a true pleasure.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.073
I want what's best
for my daughter.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.307
And from what I can tell,

00:42.309 --> 00:43.675
that's you.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.476
I'm gonna help you
get her back.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.050
(Car horns honk in distance)

00:51.052 --> 00:53.118
Mike:<i> Those videos of people</i>
<i> leaning so hard</i>

00:53.120 --> 00:55.187
<i> into the wind that</i>
<i> they're nearly horizontal?</i>

00:55.189 --> 00:57.056
That was me today.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.324
I'm so glad to be out of Chicago
and back in L.A.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.260
I missed you so much.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.795
I can't wait to get home.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.697
So, you want
to get crazy tonight?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.599
Order pizza, do nothing?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.168
(Warning beeps)

01:09.170 --> 01:10.302
(Gasps)

01:13.140 --> 01:14.173
(Screaming)

01:14.842 --> 01:15.841
Mike:
<i> Beth?</i>

01:15.843 --> 01:16.842
<i> Beth, are you okay?</i>

01:16.844 --> 01:19.078
Michael, I just crashed.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.415
I can't get out of the car!

01:23.417 --> 01:26.285
Just stay calm, I'll get help!

01:27.521 --> 01:28.687
(Screaming):
Help!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.624
Help!

01:34.595 --> 01:36.662
(Bubbling)

01:41.402 --> 01:43.702
Paige:
Just wait for it.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.839
Wait for it.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.708
And the swamp lord is back!

01:54.148 --> 01:55.147
Bet you thought that air strike
took him out.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.748
Actually, I fully expected him

01:56.750 --> 01:58.217
to survive the air strike.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.618
How do you not love
the swamp lord?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.186
It was my favorite growing up.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.388
I can't believe
you found it.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.790
Me either.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.058
It's funny how movie night

02:06.059 --> 02:07.325
happened to fall
on the one night

02:07.326 --> 02:08.592
Tim's coming home late
from San Diego.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.295
Ralph:
Sure hope they get him

02:10.297 --> 02:11.463
with that atom blaster.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.631
Which they won't,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.867
because there's no such thing.
Come on.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.602
Swamp lord just wants
to be loved.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.637
Spoiler alert.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.542
What? Chocolate-covered peanuts

02:23.544 --> 02:24.910
for your popcorn?
Oh, my god.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.579
That's how I always
eat my movie popcorn. Yes!

02:27.581 --> 02:28.580
Give me.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.182
Thanks.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.517
I smell a rat.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.552
A ripe, raw rat.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.222
He's up to something.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.896
Hey.
Mm-hmm?

02:43.898 --> 02:45.797
What's with the
cheeseball movie?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.850
What?

02:47.851 --> 02:49.902
The plot is an interesting
mélange of cold war themes.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.572
And the action isn't half bad.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.506
Balderdash.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.707
What?
I'm trying to see

02:55.709 --> 02:57.176
if turn of the century
exclamations

02:57.178 --> 02:58.443
can make a comeback.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.545
It's a small linguistics
experiment I'm doing.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.779
Anyway, hey,

03:00.781 --> 03:02.247
you don't even like movies.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.448
Yes, I do.
Hooey.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.550
You've seen two.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.651
<i>Revenge of the nerds,</i>
which you said

03:05.653 --> 03:07.303
wasn't vengeful enough...
Mm-hmm.

03:07.304 --> 03:08.954
...and<i> real genius, </i>
which you said... wasn't.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.389
Correct.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.823
And now you're into obscure
horror knockoffs

03:11.825 --> 03:13.425
which happen to be
Paige's favorite?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.961
I'm expanding my film
repertoire.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.696
I know poppycock
when I hear it.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.864
You're trying to win Paige.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.932
(Door opens)

03:22.469 --> 03:23.569
And I'm certain she's involved.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.638
(Chuckles)

03:26.640 --> 03:28.674
(Clapping)
Yay.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.975
Isn't that great?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.577
He gets the girl
in the end.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.911
Implausibly.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.680
Help me put the couch back.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.315
Thank god for that movie.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.649
It was practically
your babysitter

03:37.651 --> 03:39.618
every day after school.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.586
Nice to be reminded
how latchkey I was.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.689
Um, you all settled
into the camper?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.756
Yeah, it's great.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.692
Better than a motel.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.194
Cheaper, too.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.695
And we're clear that,
um, this is...

03:49.697 --> 03:50.696
Temporary.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.730
Absolutely.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.764
One week.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.666
Okay.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.668
Honey, I love your
hair like this.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.337
Thanks. Thanks, mom.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.846
The movie idea was excellent.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.648
Salty/sweet worked
like a charm.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.417
Good, good. Because she
deserves a man like you.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.685
Oh.
Intellectual.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.686
Kindhearted.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.021
This is gonna work out great.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.689
You seem to enjoy this process.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.458
You guys all have your gifts.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.692
I have one, too.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.760
Con woman.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.928
Persuader.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.863
Yeah.
But I'm not used to

04:24.865 --> 04:26.698
using my gifts for good.
I kind of like it.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.767
You know what
else Paige likes?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.936
The smell of Rosemary.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.738
There was a bush
under her window

04:32.740 --> 04:34.773
during the good years.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.409
It'll bring back
positive childhood memories.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.444
Excellent.
Oh, and

04:39.446 --> 04:41.713
when she was in middle school,
she was really into grunge.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.383
Mm, that's odd
for someone so hygienic.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.785
No. The music?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.621
Think flannel.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.889
I will.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.424
I'll be right back.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.660
I have to... Google something.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.767
Huh.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.769
Forestry brave cookies?

05:03.771 --> 05:06.872
If I sell 50 boxes,
i get my business badge.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.741
And how much do the braves
charge you for these?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.810
Buy 'em for five dollars,
sell 'em for five dollars.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.447
What kind of business
are they teaching you?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.649
Remember when you used to
write grandma in prison

05:17.651 --> 05:19.785
about how you wanted to spend
some quality time together?

05:19.787 --> 05:20.952
Shh. Shh.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.621
(Whispering):
I know. Our secret.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.323
But how about
we use that time

05:24.325 --> 05:26.992
for grandma to help you
earn that business badge?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.727
Mom won't go for it.
(Phone ringing)

05:28.729 --> 05:30.395
She thinks you're a degenerate.

05:30.397 --> 05:33.899
We'll keep our eyes peeled
for the opportunity. It knocks,

05:33.901 --> 05:35.000
we answer.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.768
Hello. Scorpion.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.303
Toby:
Hey, we shooting

05:38.304 --> 05:39.837
a campaign ad or what?
How much did you raise?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.841
$42.
Of the $2,000 we need.
Total bust.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.476
Sylvester:
We just chose

05:44.478 --> 05:46.745
the wrong enticement.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.613
"We" meaning "you."
You said you had a handle

05:48.615 --> 05:50.082
on what we should sell
at our social.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.451
But-- shocker--
who knew no one wants

05:52.453 --> 05:54.653
cayenne and cumin ice cream
from spoon & grain,

05:54.655 --> 05:56.689
whoever the hell they are?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.724
Lesson one:
Know your market.
Sylvester:
I read

05:58.726 --> 05:59.991
that this ice cream was hip.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.960
Hip has no place in ice cream.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.097
Ice cream is chocolate,
vanilla and strawberry. Period.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.665
Just let us give you the money.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.734
No. If I can't raise $2,000,

06:08.736 --> 06:12.804
I have no business being
alderman of west altadenia.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.106
Guys, a woman
is trapped in her car

06:14.107 --> 06:15.407
at the bottom
of the la brea tar pits.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.575
We're moving out right now.
Happy:
Whoa.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.776
Exceptionally not good.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.077
Where's the LAPD dive team?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.746
Those guys are masters
at this stuff.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.581
Searching for evidence
on a double homicide--

06:22.583 --> 06:24.082
a gun dumped in
San Pedro harbor.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.017
No divers within an hour
of the pits, the woman is

06:26.019 --> 06:28.086
struggling for oxygen.
Fire and rescue

06:28.088 --> 06:29.721
are stumped.
They need us.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.524
Honey, I know you have to work,
so I can watch Ralph.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.594
All right. Uh... okay, be good.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.762
Both of you. Walter!

06:36.764 --> 06:39.698
Yeah, I hear you!
I'm coming!

06:41.402 --> 06:42.801
Toby:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:42.803 --> 06:43.735
Alice in chains!

06:43.737 --> 06:45.036
What's with Walter in flannel?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.571
Happy:
I gave you those to use

06:46.573 --> 06:48.607
as rags in the lab.
Why are you wearing them?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.876
I always wear flannel.
I love fl-flannel.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.812
I smell more rat.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.086
Her name is Beth Reid.
She's conscious, unharmed.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.788
She's been in there
for 30 minutes.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.523
Have you had
any communication?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.191
She's 30 feet down,
but her phone still works.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.160
We can video chat with her
from the command station.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.928
I'll be in there.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.695
Oh, what size car,
and how bad is the leaking?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.865
Small sedan. There's seepage
around the windows.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.434
She must be getting
dizzy as hell

07:15.436 --> 07:16.835
from the fumes
coming off the tar.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.987
She mentioned
that, too.

07:18.988 --> 07:21.138
She needs to seal off
the windows and the ac vents.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.575
Based on heightened
breathing and the volume

07:23.577 --> 07:24.843
of the interior
of her car,

07:24.845 --> 07:25.844
we've got a 40-minute window

07:25.846 --> 07:26.778
before she runs out of oxygen.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.780
What happened here?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.781
Is that a car bumper?
We fixed a thermal scanner

07:30.784 --> 07:32.951
to the crane arm to pinpoint
the location of the car.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.153
Managed to get a hook
into the rear bumper.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.222
The front end
of the vehicle is wedged into

07:37.224 --> 07:38.523
a bed of tar.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.242
Thought we could
tow it out.

07:40.243 --> 07:41.960
You can't play tug of war with
the earth. The pits are made of

07:41.962 --> 07:43.962
high viscosity asphalt.
There's a reason

07:43.964 --> 07:45.797
the mastodons couldn't fight
their way out.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.300
Captain, I know you're trying,
but dropping a 60-pound hook...

07:48.301 --> 07:50.802
(Phone chimes)
...Into that muck might puncture
a hole in the car and drown her.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.837
Tim's here.
I'll fill him in.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.805
I'm gonna go
check on Toby.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.074
We need to rock the car
out slowly. We'll send

07:56.076 --> 07:59.244
the cable down, wrap it around
the frame and slowly wiggle it.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.247
But we need someone down there
to affix the cable.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.149
I know the LAPD divers

08:04.150 --> 08:06.050
are indisposed, but did they
offer up any suggestions?

08:06.053 --> 08:08.620
Yeah. For no one to try this.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.889
There's never been a
dive into tar before.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.824
It's hot as hell,
eventually, the toxins

08:12.826 --> 08:15.160
will disintegrate any protective
gear you're wearing.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.962
You could get stuck
and never come back up.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.930
So, in short,
diving's not an option.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.599
Gentry:
Not for anybody
on my team.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.734
It's too dangerous.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.903
Paige:
<i> Happy says</i>
<i> they won't send a robot sub in</i>

08:24.905 --> 08:26.271
to get better data.
Because?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.106
The bubbles are methane

08:28.107 --> 08:29.940
and the electrical currents that
power the remote control servers

08:29.943 --> 08:32.711
on the sub could cause
an explosion.
Got it.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.247
Wai-wait. Tim?

08:35.249 --> 08:36.848
Are you... are you all right?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.083
What happened in San Diego?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.952
I failed my physical.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.554
The mri showed
that the shrapnel

08:42.556 --> 08:45.857
has moved closer to
my spine, and, uh...

08:45.859 --> 08:48.443
I'm out of the seals,

08:48.444 --> 08:51.028
and I am out of the Navy,
effective immediately.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.597
Honorable discharge.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.133
Tim...
Look, we have
a woman to save.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.903
My back is the least of
my worries right now, so...

08:57.905 --> 09:00.839
Okay. You're right.
Okay, but I'm...

09:00.841 --> 09:02.073
I'm so sorry.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.213
You're doing great, Beth.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.015
Staying calm.
Keep looking for something

09:10.017 --> 09:12.017
to plug the window joints
and ac vents.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.985
(Rumbling and creaking,
Beth gasps)

09:13.987 --> 09:16.955
Is the car moving?
Am I sinking?

09:16.957 --> 09:18.290
Sylvester:
No. It's just settling

09:18.292 --> 09:19.891
a little. You're okay.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.960
Remember-- short breaths.
Conserve oxygen.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.128
Everything's gonna be
hunky-dory.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.763
Not if she doesn't
stop those leaks.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.931
I found something.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.666
Athletic tape for my shoulder.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.834
Perfect! Use it to seal
all of the windows

09:29.836 --> 09:31.870
and any other access points.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.004
Toby:
We're gonna

09:33.006 --> 09:34.005
get you out of there, Beth.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.140
(Quietly):
Any idea how?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.676
In 35 minutes, she
runs out of oxygen.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.978
Sly, can't you send down an air
hose? Feed it into the car?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.047
No. Even if we could, it would
need to be pressurized

09:42.049 --> 09:43.448
and pressurized air
in the car

09:43.449 --> 09:44.848
would blow out the
windows and she'd drown.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.785
Scratch the air hose.
Walter:
Happy, can you

09:46.786 --> 09:48.720
build something onto the crane
arm that would wrap the cable

09:48.722 --> 09:51.089
around the car?
In six hours.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.891
Don't have it.
What are the odds of building

09:52.893 --> 09:55.694
an effective immersion suit
within the next ten minutes?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.128
Immersion suit? Why would
we need an immersion suit?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.296
Happy:
If I can raid that

09:58.298 --> 09:59.297
fire truck and a dive shop,

09:59.299 --> 10:00.665
I can whip something up,

10:00.667 --> 10:02.000
but it won't last
long down there.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.802
Going down there
is too dangerous.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.903
I'll do it, I'll go.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.171
No, you weigh 30 pounds
more than I do.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.206
The odds are slightly better
of someone lighter

10:08.208 --> 10:09.808
being able to disengage
if they get stuck.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.909
Tim:
Then I'll do it.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.110
I've got
underwater mission experience.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.778
Tim, your back.
Is fine.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.714
Fine enough to risk
twisting wrong in that tar

10:15.716 --> 10:16.881
and winding up paralyzed?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.085
(Screams)

10:20.087 --> 10:23.121
Please hurry, I can
barely breathe in here.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.256
Okay, sly hacked
her fitness tracker,

10:25.258 --> 10:26.725
and the car isn't the only thing
that's unstable:

10:26.727 --> 10:27.959
So are her vitals.
We need a solution.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.227
That's it, I'm gonna go.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.795
Now, happy, you can
direct me

10:30.797 --> 10:32.797
where to fasten
the cabling for the car?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.099
Walter, you go down there,
your odds of survival

10:34.101 --> 10:36.001
are less than .01%.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.069
It's me, or she dies.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.652
I want everything
on the truck off the truck.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.020
I need to see the resources
we're working with.

10:55.022 --> 10:58.289
Beth? Beth?

10:58.291 --> 11:01.192
Okay, you need to tell me
everything you have in the car.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.427
I need to see what
resources we're working with.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.295
Beth, this is
Walter o'brien.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.764
He's gonna come down there
and help get you out.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.165
The fire chief said
no one could do that.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.367
Walter can. He's
going to get to you,

11:09.369 --> 11:10.869
wrap a cable around the car

11:10.871 --> 11:12.671
so it can be rocked
free from the tar.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.039
Okay. Mr. o'brien,

11:14.041 --> 11:16.041
have you done this before?
No.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.909
But you know
what you're doing?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.344
Walter: I know science.
Okay, tell me

11:19.346 --> 11:20.912
what's in the car,
we don't have time to waste.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.151
Sun block, deodorant...

11:26.153 --> 11:27.819
And I have a road flare
in my glove box.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.254
Toby:
Whoa, careful!

11:29.255 --> 11:30.688
You light that,
you could blow yourself up

11:30.691 --> 11:31.723
just from the fumes in the car.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.891
Okay.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.326
Gentlemen, this is
Michael, Beth's husband.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.729
Michael!
God, Beth!

11:37.731 --> 11:39.731
Michael, I'm scared.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.366
It's okay to be scared.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.001
But just remember,
we have a plan.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.703
It's a solid plan.
Okay.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.738
Walter, we need you.
Three blocks away,
there's a dive shop.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.839
We might be able to cobble
together something

11:47.841 --> 11:48.840
for you to wear in the tar.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.208
"Cobble together?"

11:50.210 --> 11:52.444
That doesn't sound like
a very solid plan to me.

11:52.446 --> 11:55.814
Believe me, we've been to space
and back with less preparation.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.148
Michael, stay with me.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.751
I'm right here
with you, Beth.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.573
This is it.

12:04.574 --> 12:06.825
This is where our market
lives and breathes, okay?

12:07.928 --> 12:11.463
Lumberjack moustaches,
rolled-up jeans...

12:11.465 --> 12:14.165
My mom calls these people
hipster doofuses.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.735
Yep, and they're gonna love
what we're selling.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.503
Here, put this apron on.
It's cute.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.809
"Artisan organic
Peruvian ice cream sandwiches

12:24.811 --> 12:26.177
made to order."

12:26.179 --> 12:28.179
I don't see where Peru
factors in.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.148
It factors in the bottom line.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.950
A little fairy dust
to magically

12:31.952 --> 12:34.319
increase our cash
by twelvefold.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.955
"Duodecuple" our cash.
That's the term.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.357
Right. Okay, so...

12:39.359 --> 12:41.126
One box of 24 cookies

12:41.128 --> 12:42.794
sells for $5.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.830
Turn it into 12 exotic
ice cream sandwiches

12:45.832 --> 12:47.398
at five bones apiece,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.268
and suddenly this box
is worth $60.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.470
Percentage of
profit, maestro?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.805
1,200%.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.340
But who would want to buy

12:55.342 --> 12:56.975
overpriced miniature ice creams

12:56.977 --> 12:58.343
of questionable origin?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.245
People want
to feel special.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.780
Especially these nudniks.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.314
So we let them believe

13:03.316 --> 13:05.016
that they're getting
something special.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.452
It makes them happy.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.453
We should be
charging more, actually.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.790
Look alive.
Customers. Hi.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.426
Gloves, anti-fog spray,
dive boots.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.427
Any luck
with a wet suit?

13:16.429 --> 13:17.996
No, I'm looking
for dry suits.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.831
The tar would eat through
the neoprene wet suit

13:19.833 --> 13:21.900
and burn my skin--
this one!

13:21.902 --> 13:23.968
I got everything
but the diving helmet.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.937
None in the store.
I hoped we'd be lucky,

13:25.939 --> 13:27.906
but this is a recreational
dive shop.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.208
Guys, find something
we can use as a helmet.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.310
A five-gallon water
bottle would fit,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.112
but I have to assume
that the tar

13:34.114 --> 13:36.981
would dissolve the plastic.
You assume correctly.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.850
What about a giant fishbowl?
Glass won't disintegrate, right?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.552
Fishbowl glass is too delicate.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.520
It'd crack under pressure
from being down so deep.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.055
I know this sounds crazy,

13:44.057 --> 13:45.290
but what about these
lighting sconces?

13:45.292 --> 13:48.827
Brass borders
between glass panes.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.829
Glass looks pretty thick, happy.
What do you think?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.430
Happy: I modified
a scuba regulator

13:52.432 --> 13:54.566
so there'll be
intake and outflow.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.834
You should be
able to breathe,

13:55.836 --> 13:57.569
and you should not fog up.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.204
Walter, do you see me?

14:00.073 --> 14:00.905
Yes.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.007
(Exhaling sharply)

14:03.009 --> 14:05.610
Do you see me giving you
a big fat smoochy smooch?
Horrifying.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.612
This'll help you
avoid claustrophobia,

14:07.613 --> 14:09.613
and at times it's gonna be
the only thing you can see.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.549
Uh, visibility's
gonna be limited.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.585
Hand soap.
Gallons of hand soap.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.887
It's time to grease you up!

14:15.889 --> 14:18.556
I got your tow truck.
Cabe: Tim,

14:18.558 --> 14:19.591
let's go rig it for Walter.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.610
I ran the idea

14:21.611 --> 14:23.628
of this getup
past the LAPD dive commander.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.296
He thinks
you're crazy.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.198
He's not even sure
this suit will hold.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.466
The hydroxide anions in the soap

14:28.468 --> 14:30.852
can counteract
the molar strength

14:30.853 --> 14:33.237
of tar acid for up to 32 minutes
before corrosion sets in.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.539
That's ten minutes longer

14:34.541 --> 14:36.574
than Beth has air,
so it should be fine.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.642
Better be.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.110
Happy:
All soaped up.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.446
Time to dive.
I'll get the crane down to you.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.198
We have a crane operator
on site.

14:43.199 --> 14:44.949
Can he calculate
the drop zone coordinates

14:44.951 --> 14:46.184
to a hundredth
of a centimeter?
Uh...

14:46.186 --> 14:47.185
That's what
i thought.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.419
Get him out of my rig.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.921
Hey,

14:49.923 --> 14:51.656
next movie night--
Sci-Fi or horror?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.424
Sci-Fi.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.426
Good. So I'll see you then,
right?

14:58.999 --> 15:02.667
Walter: Breathing apparatus
is working fine.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.570
At least on land, anyway.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.478
Beth, he's walking in now.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.682
Please let him know I think
he's very brave for doing this.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.285
You can tell him yourself
when you get out of that muck.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.287
(Faintly):
Okay.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.521
I have clear entry.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.555
In you go, buddy.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.556
And for the record,

15:25.558 --> 15:26.925
this is very impressive.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.307
Headed down.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.243
It's thick. It's a much slower
descent than water.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.078
Okay, Walter, I've
got you spotted.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.714
You're going to hit the tar bed
in seconds. When you do,

15:49.716 --> 15:51.716
turn four degrees to your left,
and the car

15:51.718 --> 15:53.184
will be 15 paces from you.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.230
(Groans)
That's one step.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.539
The tar is very hard
to navigate.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.674
Hey. How's he doing?
He's moving very slowly.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.676
Toby:
Walt,

16:18.678 --> 16:20.445
why don't you, uh,
think slippery thoughts?

16:20.447 --> 16:21.646
Eels. Richard Nixon.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.647
Walter:
When I go under a tar layer,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.148
it's almost pitch black.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.017
Does Beth have a flashlight
in her car?

16:26.019 --> 16:28.252
I have one in my glove box.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.489
Have her aim it
out of the driver's window.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.628
I see her.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.332
I'm close.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.076
Oh, I see him! Thank god.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.217
Hi. I'm Walter.
We met earlier.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.452
Toby:
Yeah, Walt, make sure

17:00.453 --> 17:01.686
you introduce yourself
in case someone else

17:01.688 --> 17:02.687
is passing through the tar pits.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.288
O'brien, get to work.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.723
Hook goes on the front axle,

17:05.725 --> 17:07.592
then bring the cable
over the hood,

17:07.594 --> 17:09.527
back underneath
under the drive train.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.695
I'll be right back.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.263
Okay.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.531
Mike:
Beth, listen to me.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.565
I know this'll work,

17:14.567 --> 17:16.200
but I'll need you to hear me.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.736
Okay? Thank you.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.205
Thank you
for taking a chance on me.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.641
I've never been good enough
for you, but...

17:23.643 --> 17:26.444
(Crying): Michael...
...But you still...

17:26.446 --> 17:29.113
I love you.
I just want to go home.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.515
Toby:
Beth, you will get

17:30.517 --> 17:31.883
to go home, but right now

17:31.884 --> 17:33.250
you can't get too worked up.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.685
Uh, Toby's right.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.654
You just have to regulate
your breathing, okay?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.356
So just breathe in
with me.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.241
Take a deep breath.
(Breathing deeply)

17:40.242 --> 17:42.125
I know you have a lot you
want to say, but she needs

17:42.128 --> 17:44.429
to conserve oxygen right now,
and crying doesn't help that.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.665
I know, I'm sorry, it's just,
before I met her...

17:47.667 --> 17:50.435
I wasn't a great guy.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.770
No direction.
I... I was a wreck.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.705
I understand.
I know what it's like

17:54.707 --> 17:56.340
to find that one
special woman.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.176
No, more than special.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.111
Before I met Beth, I was a dog.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.513
Bouncing around three different
women at the same time.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.415
I was a bad guy.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.484
But she saw through
my insecurities.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.386
She gave me a chance
to be the man

18:08.388 --> 18:10.154
that she knew
that I could be.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.390
But you know
what it's like.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.692
She was in love
over this nonsense playboy life.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.228
Yeah. I sure do.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.163
For certain.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.631
No, they don't.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.836
Walter:
It's fastened.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.187
Happy, start rocking the car.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.537
Okay, Beth,
get ready for some movement.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.606
Okay.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.509
(Mechanical whirring)

18:38.551 --> 18:40.418
It's pulling the car.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.452
Toby:
Side to side,

18:41.454 --> 18:42.487
that's right.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.696
Walter:
It's coming loose.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.698
(Scraping, creaking)

18:53.700 --> 18:56.167
What's happening?

18:56.169 --> 18:56.801
Happy, stop.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.304
(Creaking)

19:00.306 --> 19:01.806
Walter, what's the problem?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.374
Metal tearing.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.442
I can't see where.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.377
Beth:
It's coming in!

19:06.379 --> 19:07.545
Lots of it.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.153
The fence pole must have speared
the car when she crashed.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.654
Rocking it tore a hole
in the frame.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.523
So we can't move it anymore?
Now the car is leaking.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.524
Walter:
I can take care of it

19:19.526 --> 19:20.625
for the moment.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.496
Sylvester: Walter,
if you take off your gloves,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.431
the tar is going
to burn your hand.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.901
Yes. Only moderately so far.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.736
Happy:
That will get worse...

19:31.738 --> 19:33.121
Quickly.

19:33.122 --> 19:34.505
So if we can't move the car,

19:34.507 --> 19:35.506
what's the plan?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.541
Flood the vehicle,

19:36.543 --> 19:38.176
and then pull back
to the surface

19:38.178 --> 19:39.243
on the crane cable.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.645
Oh.
Once she's exposed to the tar,

19:40.647 --> 19:42.613
she only has 20 seconds
to get to the surface.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.881
Any longer,

19:43.883 --> 19:46.517
she's looking at
third-degree burns on over 90%

19:46.519 --> 19:48.386
of her body.
That's almost certain death.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.487
Mike:
No!

19:49.489 --> 19:50.955
She's safe in the car--
leave her there

19:50.957 --> 19:52.657
until you figure
something else out.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.358
Walter: Guys, there is nothing
else to figure out.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.826
The car cannot be raised
to the surface.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.628
Beth will have to go
through the tar.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.829
Happy:
In less than

19:58.831 --> 20:01.199
20 seconds--
this ain't gonna be easy.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.833
We can prepare
a bath of diesel fuel

20:02.835 --> 20:05.536
to quickly get the tar off her
body once she hits the surface.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.571
Guys, this sounds very dicey.

20:06.573 --> 20:07.572
(Creaking over speaker)

20:07.574 --> 20:08.673
So does that.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.241
Beth!

20:10.243 --> 20:11.676
I'm falling!

20:15.215 --> 20:16.647
Beth?

20:16.649 --> 20:17.782
Beth!
Beth!

20:17.784 --> 20:19.483
Her airbag
knocked her out.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.618
I can't pull her out
unconscious.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.320
She'll aspirate tar and die.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.723
Guys, this plan just got
considerably more dicey.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.672
That's a real-life
swamp lord.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.411
(Grunts)

20:47.413 --> 20:49.547
Come on.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.516
(Grunting)

20:53.886 --> 20:56.020
(Gasps and coughs)
Beth's condition?

20:56.022 --> 20:58.322
Uh, she's breathing and
her vitals are okay for now.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.490
Oh, god, Walter-- your hand.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.626
Toby:
Man, that's like
a caramel apple,

21:01.628 --> 21:03.361
except your hand's the apple,
the tar's the caramel,

21:03.363 --> 21:04.895
and no one finds this delicious.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.465
She has less than ten minutes
until she runs out of air.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.800
If we can't move the car,
or bring her up unconscious,

21:09.802 --> 21:11.002
then what do we do?

21:11.004 --> 21:12.403
We wake her up.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.272
Just don't ask me how.
Smelling salts.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.040
Don't you have to wave those
under a person's nose?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.643
We could deliver an eye opener
through the hole in the car

21:18.645 --> 21:20.261
that Walter plugged
with his glove.

21:20.262 --> 21:21.878
We can hook another cable to
the crane; Once she's attached,

21:21.881 --> 21:23.514
I can lift both of you
out in a few seconds.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.749
(Groans)
Tim: I'll start rigging
the new line.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.317
We can use an atomizer

21:26.319 --> 21:27.518
to pump the salts
through the hole,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.420
and then disperse it
through the vehicle.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.321
I can handle the atomizer.
We need a syringe and a tube.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.356
On it.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.375
What do you use
for smelling salts?

21:34.376 --> 21:36.393
Well, it would have to be a
potent combination to wake her.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.728
Something truly noxious.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.963
I know where to get that.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.898
I'll be back.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.569
Here you go.

21:45.571 --> 21:47.438
Cayenne, cumin,
himalayan sea salt,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.640
and every other spice
i got on my rig.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.976
Now, at $3.00
a pinch-topping,

21:51.978 --> 21:54.045
that's $750.
I don't think so.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.079
On behalf
of the U.S. government,

21:55.081 --> 21:56.547
I'm commandeering your truck

21:56.549 --> 21:58.082
and all the spices on it.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.950
Hey. You can't do that.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.952
Trust me,
I'm doing you all a favor.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.321
Doesn't matter, people.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.689
Looks like there's
a small Peruvian boy

22:04.691 --> 22:08.426
selling organic ice cream
on the corner of 1st and flower.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.894
<i> Viva Peru!</i>

22:11.030 --> 22:12.663
Next.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.334
Uh, lavender goat cheese ice
cream on cinnamon cookies.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.969
That is a fantastic choice.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.504
Very original.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.674
Isn't this great?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.677
Grandma and Ralph's
big adventure.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.679
Is that something
you and my mom would have?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.715
Big adventures?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.717
Oh, yeah, we did
all sorts of things.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.018
Like what?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.586
We had lots of
great times.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.054
We were real pals.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.957
So how come you guys
haven't spoken in so long?

22:39.959 --> 22:42.460
I asked you that in one of
my letters to you in prison.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.762
Shh. Not so loud, honey.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.666
But you never
answered my question.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.535
It's complicated, and
we have customers, okay?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.771
I can't wait to tell mom
about how much money we made.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.906
About that...
I don't think we need

22:55.908 --> 22:57.842
to share all the
details with her.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.845
I think it's best to frame
it for her, you know?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.813
Show it in its best light.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.448
By omitting facts?

23:04.450 --> 23:07.685
By framing them.
We sold cookies.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.553
That's what's relevant.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.855
How we did it
is less important.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.423
Okay...

23:12.425 --> 23:14.125
Good boy.
Keep scooping.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.129
(Coughing)

23:21.167 --> 23:23.134
(Both gagging, coughing)

23:23.136 --> 23:25.569
Try not to lose this one.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.738
This one's for you,
and this one's for Beth.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.107
All right.
Cable's good to go.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.542
And this will be ready to roll
when you emerge.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.177
Mix of diesel fuel and solvent

23:33.178 --> 23:34.811
to dissolve the hydrocarbons
and heterocyclic compounds

23:34.814 --> 23:36.080
in the tar on Beth's skin.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.848
You're starting to sound
a lot like them.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.802
Thank you.
So...

23:41.803 --> 23:44.854
This one's, uh, a lot scarier
than the movie, huh?

23:44.857 --> 23:46.891
Sylvester: You need to
protect the atomizer.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.660
Its polypropylene polymers

23:49.662 --> 23:51.929
will not last long
in the tar.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.800
Ready.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.037
Cabe:
Okay. There you go.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.893
He's gonna have to move fast
once he gets down there.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.529
Beth's out of oxygen
in roughly three minutes.

24:25.531 --> 24:28.632
♪ ♪

24:41.581 --> 24:42.880
He's at the car.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.949
♪ ♪

24:48.821 --> 24:49.920
Walter:
Tube's in.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.856
Hitting the plunger.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.830
Come on. Wake up, please.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.832
(Gasps)

25:01.834 --> 25:03.834
It worked!

25:03.836 --> 25:06.103
That's all those toppings
are good for.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.840
What's happening?
(Gasping)

25:09.842 --> 25:11.842
Walter:
Beth. Don't worry.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.577
We have an idea for
getting you out of here.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.179
Okay.
But it all depends

25:15.181 --> 25:17.047
on how long
you can hold your breath.

25:23.723 --> 25:24.989
What are you talking about?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.657
Why do I have to hold my breath?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.092
Lack of better options.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.727
Walter:
I'm pulling you out of the car.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.729
You'll be on land
in 20 seconds,

25:31.731 --> 25:33.063
but we need your help.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.532
Cabe:
Beth, put on your backpack,

25:34.534 --> 25:35.883
connect your chest strap.

25:35.884 --> 25:37.233
Walter's gonna use that
to connect to the cable.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.837
And use the athletic tape
to wrap your whole head.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.872
Cover your eyes,
ears, nose, mouth.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.607
It's gonna be very
claustrophobic.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.709
You won't be able to breathe,
but it won't be for long.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.545
This will stop the caustic acid
in the tar

25:47.547 --> 25:48.779
from entering your body.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.180
Okay.
Toby: And use the sunscreen

25:50.182 --> 25:51.315
to cover all exposed skin.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.983
It'll help fight

25:52.985 --> 25:54.218
the viscoelasticity in the tar.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.890
(Gasping)

26:02.194 --> 26:04.628
You can do this; It'll be
over before you know it.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.731
She has no other options; In
90 seconds she runs out of air.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.033
Beth, do it now.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.101
(Sighing)

26:16.776 --> 26:20.177
Paige:
Beth, take a deep breath,
burn away from the window.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.879
And in few seconds
it'll all be over.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.181
(Crying):
Mike, I love you.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.282
I love you, too.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.117
(Crying)

26:27.119 --> 26:28.185
(Inhales)

26:30.890 --> 26:32.924
Go, Walter, now!

26:32.925 --> 26:34.959

pull us up.

Walter, Walter. You all right?
Walter: No.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.825
My feet are stuck in the tar.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.126

27:09.128 --> 27:10.694
Come on, guys,
what are we waiting on?

27:10.696 --> 27:12.363
Did you try rocking
your boots back and forth

27:12.365 --> 27:14.182

Mike: She's running out of time.

Toby: You got
to get unstuck, buddy,

27:17.236 --> 27:19.336
she's gonna have
life-threatening burns

27:19.338 --> 27:20.971
in 15 seconds.
Oh, god.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.273
Mike:
Come, on, please.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.742

Sylvester: What do you mean

27:24.744 --> 27:26.076
you're sending her up?
Walter: I'm stuck.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.277
She isn't.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.879
I'm unhooking my cable...
Pull her up!

Careful, careful.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.722
Okay.

27:38.724 --> 27:39.690

28:01.280 --> 28:04.882
Hook must've snagged it
on the way up.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.784

Now it's your turn
to stay calm, buddy.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.998
Okay, I am estimating he's got
roughly two minutes

28:21.000 --> 28:22.332
of oxygen left in his mask
and suit.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.335
We need to figure out a way
to get both of his legs

28:25.337 --> 28:27.938
out of the pocket of asphalt
and bring him to the surface.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.373
Look, sly's right.
We need a plan,

28:29.375 --> 28:31.341
or the bones
next to<i> smilodon fatalis</i>

28:31.343 --> 28:33.010

28:40.019 --> 28:42.052
not have any other ideas?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.488
His dive suit and his chances
of survival are melting away.

spoon & grain truck.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.170

29:00.172 --> 29:01.905
The only reason we outsold

29:01.907 --> 29:03.273
the actual spoon & grain truck

29:03.275 --> 29:05.859
is because
they had to shut down.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.444
A government agent commandeered
all their toppings.

Melt the tar... brilliant.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.005
Sylvester:
If Walter heats the tar,

29:35.007 --> 29:36.940
it'll lower its adhesion level,
and he can pull his legs free.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.942
How is he gonna melt anything
down there?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.144
He's got to start a fire.

can't it cause an explosion?

Maybe, but it's better
than trying to breathe
without oxygen.

for getting to spend the night
with my grandson.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.895
Honey,
he's amazing.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.830
You are a
great mom.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.299
And we both know that
you didn't learn that from me.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.368
So...

37:18.370 --> 37:19.836
I understand

37:19.838 --> 37:21.538
if you want me to go.

37:22.507 --> 37:25.308
Okay. Just...

37:25.310 --> 37:27.911
Check in with me before you...

37:27.913 --> 37:29.913
Do anything entrepreneurial.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.348
You're the boss.

37:46.765 --> 37:47.931
Everything okay?
Oh, you know,

37:47.933 --> 37:50.400
I'm... used to her
manipulating me,

37:50.402 --> 37:53.270
but I can't have her
manipulating Ralph.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.406
I'm just not sure
she can help herself.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.477
I can see
how that would upset you.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.912
Uh, but if I may?

38:02.914 --> 38:05.448
We both

38:05.450 --> 38:07.050
heard a man today
who was so thankful

38:07.052 --> 38:09.619
that his wife gave him a chance
to change who he was.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.621
She saw the
better in him.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.290
Do you think...

38:13.292 --> 38:16.326
There's better in...
Your mother?

38:17.296 --> 38:19.596
Maybe.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.366
You have a decision to make.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.302
You know, I can handle a lot,

38:25.304 --> 38:26.436
but not dishonesty.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.704
And not with my son.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.873
With the way
i was raised,

38:29.875 --> 38:33.643
it just... turns my stomach.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.348
Anyway, you have a...

38:38.350 --> 38:39.382
You have a good night.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.384
I have some things
to finish up.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.886
Good night.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.388
(Chuckles softly)

38:57.903 --> 39:00.403
(Quietly):
Hey. Way to rock that flannel.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.604
I have another idea
you can use...

39:01.606 --> 39:02.806
You know,
someone said to me today

39:02.808 --> 39:04.974
they knew poppycock
when they heard it.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.376
And all your
suggestions,

39:06.378 --> 39:07.510
they're poppycock.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.413
They're... claptrap. Hokum.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.882
I feel like I'm being dressed
down by grover Cleveland.

39:12.884 --> 39:16.653
Conning Paige may have been
an efficient way to impress her,

39:16.655 --> 39:18.355
but it's not the honest way.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.889
Veronica,

39:19.891 --> 39:21.391
if she ever found out,

39:21.393 --> 39:24.794
it would hurt her very deeply.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.530
If I'm gonna
win her,

39:27.532 --> 39:29.733
I want to do it the right way.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.369
Understood.

39:32.371 --> 39:33.670
I'll back down.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.472
Okay.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.307
But for the record,

39:37.308 --> 39:39.141
this makes me want you to end up
with her even more.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.879
You're a really
good man, Walter.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.749
And I wish you luck, 'cause...

39:45.751 --> 39:48.418
That guy's planting roots.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.625
(Speaking indistinctly)
