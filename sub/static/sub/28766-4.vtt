<i>Non, non,</i> Victor goes to school.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.505
<i>C'est</i> all <i>un</i> act, again.

00:12.588 --> 00:14.505
Tell him to stop the <i>caprices.</i>

00:14.588 --> 00:15.588
<i>Voilà.</i>

00:15.671 --> 00:17.588
<i>Merci.</i> Call me back. <i>Au revoir.</i>

00:18.005 --> 00:20.296
Why do none of you want to work today?

00:21.588 --> 00:24.380
Listen, I'm sorry. I'll refund you.

00:24.463 --> 00:27.338
Give me some notice next time,
I have other things to do.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.463
Do you get hard with her?

00:32.921 --> 00:33.921
Who?

00:35.171 --> 00:37.171
No, that's not it.

00:38.046 --> 00:39.338
OK, no hard feelings.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.338
I'll have to go to Pilates,
it's no bad thing.

00:43.421 --> 00:45.255
I promise it won't happen again.

00:45.338 --> 00:48.338
I should hope not,
you can't have many regulars like me.

00:52.338 --> 00:53.380
Fuck...

00:53.463 --> 00:56.005
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:56.088 --> 00:58.046
THE LAME PLAN

00:58.130 --> 00:59.796
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:59.880 --> 01:02.421
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:02.505 --> 01:04.380
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

01:14.796 --> 01:15.921
Hello.

01:16.005 --> 01:17.088
Elsa Payette?

01:18.005 --> 01:19.005
There's no card.

01:20.296 --> 01:22.546
No worries, I know who they're from.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.130
Thank you.

01:36.588 --> 01:37.838
They're beautiful.

01:37.921 --> 01:40.838
-Thanks, Daddy.
-Screw the Mulhouse guy.

02:40.921 --> 02:43.296
-Are you not working today?
-No.

02:44.255 --> 02:45.255
Are you?

02:45.796 --> 02:48.588
Yes. This afternoon,
for a fashion magazine.

02:49.546 --> 02:51.796
Why don't you look for a real job?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.255
Something stable, permanent.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.838
I don't have time.
I have my own things to do.

02:57.921 --> 03:01.171
You have your pastry bar,
I have my vision board.

03:01.255 --> 03:05.880
Fruit and Louis XIV, what's your project?
A smoothie bar in Versailles?

03:06.588 --> 03:07.588
No.

03:07.671 --> 03:11.713
-I take the time to build my projects.
-Dude, your account's suspended.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.213
Are you going to crash here long?

03:14.296 --> 03:18.088
"Airbnbang" was nice for a while
but I didn't sign up for your depression.

03:23.213 --> 03:24.588
I have nowhere else to go.

03:26.713 --> 03:27.880
Chacha, are you there?

03:28.338 --> 03:30.213
Yes, just a sec, I'm coming!

03:30.296 --> 03:31.713
-Move it! Hide!
-Open!

03:33.046 --> 03:35.255
I'm coming, just getting dressed!

03:35.338 --> 03:36.338
Quick!

03:37.213 --> 03:40.046
I can't hold it and he's playing
Candy Crush on the toilet!

03:40.130 --> 03:43.046
Hang on a sec,
don't you have a sink in your kitchen?

03:43.130 --> 03:45.296
OK, hurry though, I'm late.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.130
Fine, just go, I'll lock up.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.505
-Think she'll recover from the whore?
-Let's talk later?

03:58.630 --> 03:59.755
By the way,

03:59.838 --> 04:02.921
we haven't slept for five days,
are you filming a porno?

04:03.296 --> 04:04.546
Yeah, with your dad.

04:05.130 --> 04:08.463
-And black and Arab guys, his favorite.
-You can be so exasperating.

04:09.130 --> 04:10.380
Right, see you tonight?

04:10.463 --> 04:11.880
Yeah, see you tonight.

04:12.963 --> 04:16.880
And clean up Moules's cage,
the stink is going to waft down to mine.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.921
-His name is Moules-Frites.
-Whatever.

04:23.421 --> 04:24.588
The coast is clear!

04:26.296 --> 04:28.713
It's clear. She's gone.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.338
Are you OK? The pastry bar?

04:34.880 --> 04:35.880
Yeah?

04:35.963 --> 04:37.255
I lost everything.

04:38.046 --> 04:39.255
I don't get it.

04:39.338 --> 04:40.338
I fucked up.

04:40.421 --> 04:42.338
I spent too much on the company card

04:42.421 --> 04:45.463
and the Chinese fucked me over
with the contract.

04:46.755 --> 04:48.463
I lost everything, I'm screwed.

04:50.671 --> 04:52.921
But that's so unfair, it's your business!

04:55.213 --> 04:56.338
Come out.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.046
Shit...

05:00.921 --> 05:01.963
I'll start over.

05:02.755 --> 05:04.421
Just don't tell the others, OK?

05:05.171 --> 05:06.463
OK.

05:07.005 --> 05:11.338
So, what's the plan?
You want to keep banging her but unpaid?

05:12.046 --> 05:14.463
Don't you offer those athletes a discount?

05:14.546 --> 05:16.755
-What?
-Two for one.

05:17.963 --> 05:19.046
Totally different.

05:19.130 --> 05:22.796
No, I bang the woman and the dude
watches us from his umpire chair.

05:24.338 --> 05:28.088
Game, sex and match. Get it?

05:30.921 --> 05:34.463
Seriously, what are you going to do?
Tell her the truth?

05:39.296 --> 05:42.463
In two days, you'll have forgotten
about the whole thing.

05:42.546 --> 05:44.088
I don't know, Chantal.

05:44.171 --> 05:45.296
It's all so weird. It's not.

05:46.838 --> 05:49.421
You had a nice time,
you got back on track.

05:49.505 --> 05:51.213
You had a little love story.

05:51.838 --> 05:53.213
Are you going to help?

05:54.838 --> 05:57.171
I saw him three times,
that's no love story.

05:57.963 --> 06:01.296
But there was something about him, like...

06:02.255 --> 06:03.921
spontaneous, unpredictable.

06:05.088 --> 06:09.796
All I know is that if I had you,
I wouldn't move to Mulhouse.

06:16.296 --> 06:17.921
I think I'll call him Jules.

06:18.505 --> 06:19.880
No, I don't think so.

06:27.296 --> 06:28.296
Elsa?

06:32.338 --> 06:33.755
Hey, how are you?

06:33.838 --> 06:35.046
Yeah, great.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.130
We came to an agreement
with the owner of the sports hall.

06:39.213 --> 06:41.046
It's temporary but they're safe.

06:41.505 --> 06:42.505
Cool. The wedding...

06:46.046 --> 06:49.505
Ah! The girls told me, it's great!

06:49.588 --> 06:53.171
I didn't dare tell you
because recently I've felt you've...

06:53.255 --> 06:54.546
No, no, no!

06:54.630 --> 06:57.130
I actually recently met a guy.

06:57.213 --> 06:59.463
So, I've turned over a new leaf.

06:59.546 --> 07:02.046
New chapter, new volume, even, so...

07:02.880 --> 07:03.713
Cool.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.671
And Gaïa is so...

07:07.296 --> 07:08.671
She's so...

07:09.255 --> 07:11.755
passionate, curious,

07:11.838 --> 07:14.546
so amazing for you, I mean, wow!

07:14.630 --> 07:16.171
-Wow!
-Yeah...

07:16.921 --> 07:18.921
I hope you're both coming to my birthday.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.505
-You're throwing a party?
-Well, I'm not.

07:21.588 --> 07:24.921
The girls are. But it's a surprise
so I'm not supposed to know.

07:25.005 --> 07:26.005
Mum's the word.

07:29.921 --> 07:32.671
I better be off, I'm busy to the max, Max.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.921
OK, see you.

07:36.005 --> 07:37.671
Totally! Hugs and kisses!

07:41.213 --> 07:43.588
" Hugs and kisses..."

07:50.380 --> 07:54.130
So, you're just going to sit here all day
like a depressed model?

07:54.213 --> 07:55.046
Yeah.

07:55.130 --> 07:56.130
"Yeah."

08:01.796 --> 08:04.338
"Just the other night,
I was sleeping under a bridge.

08:05.546 --> 08:08.213
And now here I am
on the grandest ship in the world,

08:08.296 --> 08:10.588
having champagne with you fine people."

08:10.671 --> 08:11.921
Why did you sleep--

08:14.130 --> 08:16.213
"I figure life's a fucking gift, honey.

08:18.755 --> 08:20.380
I don't intend on wasting it, Rose."

08:24.130 --> 08:26.421
You're insane, what are you on about?

08:27.463 --> 08:29.630
It's the scene I chose for my drama class.

08:30.505 --> 08:33.171
<i>Titanic.</i> Leo's part. Ring any bells?

08:33.505 --> 08:36.463
Same story for you:
Elsa's on the upper deck,

08:36.546 --> 08:39.380
you're here, in the hold, with the rats.

08:39.463 --> 08:42.130
Wasn't it supposed to be
"the most amazing love story"?

08:42.213 --> 08:45.296
-Remember the end with the door?
-Don't even try.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.296
Everyone knows they could both have fit.

08:50.505 --> 08:51.963
I think you're going to sink.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.671
It's your call, dude.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.005
BIZET HOSPITAL

09:03.421 --> 09:05.005
What's taking so long?

09:05.088 --> 09:06.713
Is he telling them it's a dwarf?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.796
-Come on, Milou!
-All right.

09:10.338 --> 09:11.838
WAITING ROOM

09:16.546 --> 09:18.963
Mega hot nurses aren't a myth, then.

09:19.588 --> 09:21.255
I might have to keep you at home.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.755
"Mega hot..."

09:22.838 --> 09:23.838
She's not...

09:24.505 --> 09:25.588
She's not the hottest.

09:26.630 --> 09:27.630
-Really?
-Hello. Hello!

09:34.880 --> 09:37.255
I bet it feels
like a rollercoaster at home.

09:39.630 --> 09:40.463
No.

09:40.796 --> 09:41.880
Lucky you.

09:42.296 --> 09:43.130
Yeah.

09:44.713 --> 09:46.296
-Want to know?
-No!

09:48.171 --> 09:50.963
-You'll give in, everyone does.
-Not us, we'll wait.

09:53.296 --> 09:54.296
Any preference?

09:54.380 --> 09:55.421
-Girl.
-Boy.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.880
-We said a boy.
<i>-You</i> said a boy.

10:00.588 --> 10:01.588
I want a girl. Boy.

10:28.505 --> 10:29.505
Goodbye, Jules.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.421
It's not called Jules!

10:48.338 --> 10:50.338
Aw, he's sucking his thumb!

11:08.380 --> 11:11.838
So cute, look!

11:12.588 --> 11:13.880
Thanks.

11:15.338 --> 11:18.713
-To think it could be mine and Jules's...
-It's not yours.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.463
He left so, now,
you just have to deal with it.

11:22.546 --> 11:24.505
-That wasn't the point anyway.
-Yeah.

11:25.213 --> 11:28.421
-The point of what?
-The point was to...

11:29.255 --> 11:30.255
Hey.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.380
Weren't you leaving today?

11:35.463 --> 11:37.505
-I'm not leaving.
-What do you mean?

11:38.213 --> 11:39.213
Yeah.

11:39.296 --> 11:43.005
It's true, the guy was supposed
to leave and then doesn't. Liar.

11:43.088 --> 11:46.171
These are my friends,
don't pay any attention to them.

11:46.255 --> 11:47.755
Milou, Chacha, Jules.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.546
Jules, Chacha, Milou.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.880
-They can be a bit weird.
-So I see.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.255
-Pleased to meet you.
-Delighted.

11:55.338 --> 11:57.755
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Yes.

12:02.713 --> 12:05.546
-What's your mate doing here?
-Easy. He's not my mate!

12:06.796 --> 12:08.713
-Maybe she paid him?
-Nonsense.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.713
He's going to blackmail us.

12:11.296 --> 12:12.630
Should we kill him?

12:17.380 --> 12:18.213
So?

12:18.630 --> 12:20.505
He's coming over tonight.

12:20.838 --> 12:21.838
For dinner.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.880
Dad's on a yoga retreat so...

12:24.296 --> 12:27.046
-What?
-Is he not allowed to do yoga?

12:27.130 --> 12:28.421
What about Mulhouse?

12:28.505 --> 12:30.505
I mean, the kids in Mulhouse?

12:30.588 --> 12:34.505
-Are they not allowed a teacher?
-Budget cuts. Workforce reduction.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.505
Bureaucracy, you know.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.088
-What a coincidence.
-Yeah.

12:38.546 --> 12:40.463
-He's mega cute, right?
-Meh.

12:41.213 --> 12:43.380
-He looks better in pictures.
-I agree.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.088
-No, no, no.
-Yes.

12:45.171 --> 12:47.505
-He's mega cute, you're wrong.
-No.

13:06.921 --> 13:07.755
Hey!

13:08.338 --> 13:09.588
What are you doing here?

13:09.671 --> 13:11.380
How are you? You look nice.

13:12.338 --> 13:14.796
But it's pretty tight - a little whorish?

13:16.005 --> 13:19.171
-Is he here?
-No, he's due in five minutes.

13:19.255 --> 13:22.088
So, if you could... clear off.

13:22.505 --> 13:24.630
You know that velvet dress I lent you?

13:25.713 --> 13:28.130
-Eight years ago?
-Yes. Can I have it back?

13:28.588 --> 13:29.421
Tonight?

13:29.505 --> 13:30.796
Yeah, sorry.

13:31.671 --> 13:33.130
Do you think it still fits?

13:33.588 --> 13:34.588
Yeah, why?

13:34.671 --> 13:36.213
You know, because...

13:36.296 --> 13:39.421
-What's your point?
-Milou, you're a pain in the ass.

13:56.755 --> 13:58.505
-Have you found it?
-Yes!

14:02.255 --> 14:03.296
-Is this it?
-Yes.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.630
-OK, here you go.
-This is pretty...

14:06.005 --> 14:08.796
I met him so briefly earlier,
can I just say hi?

14:08.880 --> 14:12.171
-No, Milou!
-It's so pretty, I love the glasses.

14:12.255 --> 14:13.588
-OK.
-Super cute.

14:13.671 --> 14:15.671
-One last thing.
-Yes?

14:15.755 --> 14:18.880
Remember, you can't let men
have everything at once.

14:18.963 --> 14:21.713
-Keep a hint of mystery.
-OK.

14:22.088 --> 14:25.088
-Great. OK, off you go.
-All good?

14:27.505 --> 14:29.421
-Bye!
-Your top's pretty tight...

14:32.880 --> 14:34.588
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.421
-How's it going?
-Good.

14:46.171 --> 14:48.171
-Here, I brought you this.
-Thank you.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.505
The fox is in the henhouse, I repeat,

15:11.588 --> 15:13.255
the fox is in the henhouse.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.880
-There we go.
-Here.

15:16.963 --> 15:18.796
What if it goes wrong?

15:19.713 --> 15:20.713
We tail him.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.630
I lost my license.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.713
I can rent this car but I can't drive it.

15:26.421 --> 15:27.671
Well, yeah.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.296
<i>It's just something simple.</i>

15:31.546 --> 15:33.213
<i>-I'm happy to be here.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

15:33.296 --> 15:37.546
<i>It's weird, don't you feel like...</i>
<i>this was the first time we met?</i>

15:38.296 --> 15:39.296
<i>You're right.</i>

15:39.838 --> 15:42.213
This thing works really well, right?

15:42.671 --> 15:44.880
I could leave the kid at home
and go drinking.

15:45.296 --> 15:48.338
-No one does that, Emilie.
-What if I stayed nearby?

15:51.005 --> 15:52.796
INCOMING CALL: ANTOINE

15:53.130 --> 15:54.671
<i>-Want some?</i>
<i>-It looks delicious.</i>

15:55.838 --> 15:57.588
<i>-Did you make it?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

15:58.421 --> 16:00.838
<i>When I was little, I wanted to be a cook.</i>

16:01.338 --> 16:06.671
But my mom found it degrading
so she didn't really encourage me...

16:07.671 --> 16:10.338
She thinks everything I do
is degrading anyway.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.838
Whatever.
Did you always want to be a teacher?

16:16.546 --> 16:19.005
When I was little,
my parents saw me writing books.

16:19.838 --> 16:23.505
<i>Traveling the world for conferences</i>
<i>on specialist subjects.</i>

16:23.588 --> 16:26.171
They never studied
so it was important to them.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.213
<i>-And then...</i>
-Not bad.

16:29.296 --> 16:31.296
My dad died when I started uni.

16:33.046 --> 16:37.380
So, my mum had to pay off his debt
with her caretaker salary.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.338
<i>And I had to work to help her.</i>

16:39.421 --> 16:40.421
I'm sorry. Don't be.

16:42.630 --> 16:43.630
I love my job.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.880
<i>I regret nothing.</i>

16:46.796 --> 16:48.296
<i>My mum is an incredible woman.</i>

16:48.380 --> 16:51.630
She sacrificed everything for me
so it's normal for me to...

16:53.463 --> 16:54.963
-Shall we start?
-Yes.

16:55.463 --> 16:56.463
Bon appétit. This guy is good!

16:58.130 --> 17:00.505
I know! And those are his lines, not mine.

17:00.588 --> 17:01.796
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:03.421 --> 17:04.671
He's such a pain!

17:06.046 --> 17:07.713
<i>My dad's recipe. Buon appetito!</i>

17:12.213 --> 17:15.213
How did you land up at City Hall?

17:17.880 --> 17:18.880
By plane. I'm kidding.

17:23.130 --> 17:23.963
Lame!

17:24.921 --> 17:26.755
She thinks she's funny, too.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.630
I got the job through my ex.
I started with a head full of dreams...

17:31.713 --> 17:34.671
No! She's talking about her ex,
that's not good.

17:34.755 --> 17:37.546
Charlotte, we don't want it to go well,
remember?

17:37.630 --> 17:39.505
-Oh, yeah.
-Why are you whispering?

17:39.588 --> 17:40.963
-I'm not!
-You are!

17:41.046 --> 17:42.546
-OK, I'll stop.
-For real?

17:42.630 --> 17:43.630
Yes, OK. Right, Jules...

17:48.171 --> 17:49.505
tell me the truth now.

17:52.213 --> 17:53.380
<i>The truth about what?</i>

17:54.213 --> 17:55.963
<i>-You're hiding something.</i>
-Oh, no!

17:56.046 --> 17:59.046
-Hey, what are you doing?
-OK, OK.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.921
-What?
-Yeah, what?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.921
Why don't you tell me
my osso buco is disgusting?

18:17.213 --> 18:18.171
Fuck!

18:18.255 --> 18:20.296
She'll be the death of me!

18:21.588 --> 18:23.713
-You were worried.
-A little bit.

18:23.796 --> 18:25.880
I mean, it's not great but...

18:25.963 --> 18:28.630
It's absolutely inedible! It's awful!

18:28.713 --> 18:30.255
-But I soldiered on.
-Yes...

18:31.505 --> 18:33.088
It shows how much I like you.

18:40.713 --> 18:43.588
-The guy's really hitting on her!
-Yep.

18:44.255 --> 18:48.671
Sorry about earlier, it was a bit awkward.
My friends can be overprotective.

18:48.755 --> 18:50.713
-That's true friendship.
-Yeah.

18:50.796 --> 18:55.005
I love them like sisters but, sometimes,
their "too-much-ness" smothers me.

18:55.088 --> 18:58.296
Like, Charlotte is mega funny
but she's a bit out of touch.

18:58.380 --> 19:01.755
<i>And Emilie is a bit of a control freak,</i>
<i>it can be quite annoying.</i>

19:01.838 --> 19:04.838
What? A control freak? Nonsense!

19:04.921 --> 19:07.880
And me, too out of touch?
What does that even mean?

19:07.963 --> 19:10.046
I prefer to be out of touch than in touch.

19:10.130 --> 19:12.630
-Absolutely.
-She's making a fool of herself.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.130
Too out of touch...

19:16.463 --> 19:19.088
-So, you lived here as a kid.
-Yeah.

19:19.171 --> 19:23.380
I grew up here,
left and then came back, like a loser.

19:24.046 --> 19:25.505
-It happens.
-Yeah.

19:26.338 --> 19:29.421
I'm flat-sharing with my dad, aged 30.

19:30.630 --> 19:34.255
It's just weird to come back
to where we used to be a family,

19:34.338 --> 19:36.088
with my sister, my mom.

19:36.588 --> 19:39.796
-Does your mom live alone?
-My mom's a bit special.

19:40.505 --> 19:41.505
Why?

19:42.880 --> 19:43.713
Well...

19:44.380 --> 19:46.088
It's an awful thing to say but...

19:47.338 --> 19:49.171
I've never felt my mother's love.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.546
She's always preferred my sister
because she's so...

19:53.963 --> 19:55.755
she's so much more everything.

19:55.838 --> 19:57.713
That's what my mom thinks, and me.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.755
Fuck...

19:59.838 --> 20:03.296
-She hasn't mentioned this for a while.
-I hear about it all the time.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.380
-What's going on?
-Is it broken?

20:09.880 --> 20:10.713
Shit...

20:17.796 --> 20:18.630
No!

20:19.880 --> 20:21.880
-OK, so...
-Yes?

20:24.046 --> 20:24.880
<i>Yes...</i>

20:24.963 --> 20:28.380
Sorry, are you taking this car or not?
It's the last one.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.380
-Sorry.
-Yeah...

20:37.838 --> 20:39.546
-We have to turn it off.
-No!

20:39.630 --> 20:40.588
What?

20:40.671 --> 20:43.380
-You're disgusting!
-I'm not, I'm protecting my friend!

20:43.463 --> 20:45.213
-Could he hurt her?
-You never know.

20:45.296 --> 20:46.796
He could have an urge to...

20:49.630 --> 20:51.505
-See?
-Who do you bang?

20:54.255 --> 20:57.630
-They were so...
-I can't, it's disgusting.

21:02.088 --> 21:03.213
I'll leave you to it.

21:08.755 --> 21:11.005
WILL YOU... TELL DADDY...

21:11.088 --> 21:12.713
YOU WANT... TO MARRY HIM...

21:12.796 --> 21:14.046
PLEASE?

21:15.546 --> 21:16.380
Hey.

21:17.713 --> 21:19.088
-Hey.
-Where were you?

21:19.171 --> 21:21.421
-I called a thousand times.
-With Charlotte.

21:22.255 --> 21:23.255
Long story.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.671
Well, I was waiting for you...

21:27.921 --> 21:29.505
I wanted to mark the occasion.

21:30.546 --> 21:33.088
-Yeah, I can see that.
-What do you think?

21:34.005 --> 21:36.546
Well, you moved my desk...

21:38.005 --> 21:39.255
We're having a baby.

21:40.213 --> 21:42.005
It might be time to make it official.

21:42.713 --> 21:44.380
-Make what official?
-Us two.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.338
Emilie...

21:48.921 --> 21:50.588
will you marry me?

21:55.130 --> 21:58.005
-I know it wasn't planned...
-No, I didn't plan this.

22:00.130 --> 22:02.463
Just because I'm pregnant
doesn't mean we have to.

22:08.171 --> 22:11.630
-You don't want to?
-It's not about wanting, it's...

22:12.630 --> 22:16.296
What's with the commitment thing?
We're above all that.

22:17.588 --> 22:19.630
We are committed, we're having a baby.

22:20.338 --> 22:21.338
I don't get you.

22:22.171 --> 22:23.588
I can see that.

22:24.005 --> 22:27.546
-Don't you love me anymore?
-Of course I love you but...

22:27.630 --> 22:29.713
But? What's your problem?

22:29.796 --> 22:31.380
Because I'm the problem?

22:34.421 --> 22:35.421
Antoine...

22:46.671 --> 22:48.046
Charlotte, it's me, open up.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.213
-Antoine? What's wrong?
-Can I sleep here tonight?

22:55.296 --> 22:57.296
What? Hang on, why?

22:58.380 --> 23:00.463
-Wait...
-Shit! Moules-Frites!

23:08.963 --> 23:09.963
What's going on?

23:12.588 --> 23:14.546
-Well, I...
-We wanted to tell you.

23:14.630 --> 23:15.630
Shut up.

23:16.546 --> 23:20.338
-What's going on?
-I'm legal, I don't need to tell you!

23:21.921 --> 23:23.921
-Grab your stuff and get out.
-What?

23:24.005 --> 23:25.588
-I can't...
-Get out, I said!

23:25.671 --> 23:26.671
Antoine, stop it!

23:26.755 --> 23:28.380
-I'm butt-naked!
-Get out!

23:30.130 --> 23:31.588
Wait... Shit! Here.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.963
Happy now? Was that a good power trip?

23:38.755 --> 23:41.546
You can't stand up to her
so you take it out on us!

23:43.963 --> 23:44.963
She said no.
