00:05.200 --> 00:07.800
WOMAN:
I hope you don't mind
decaf, Father.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.200
It's all we had
in the cupboard.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.900
A night this cold, I'll
take whatever I can get.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.300
Colleen's upstairs
when you're ready.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.200
Colleen?

00:30.500 --> 00:33.100
Colleen, it's me.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.100
It's all right!

00:39.500 --> 00:41.900
Colleen, it's only me.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.500
I'm here to pray
with you.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.200
F-Father?

00:52.700 --> 00:55.200
Oh, Father,
I'm so sorry.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.400
I-I didn't realize...

00:57.400 --> 00:58.300
It's all right,
my child.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.000
No, no, no, no,
it isn't all right.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.900
You're His emissary,
and I-I tried to hurt you.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.200
I-I need to make it up to you.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.800
I need to make it up to Him.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.900
I can hurt myself!

01:09.900 --> 01:11.700
Please don't, Colleen.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.500
He doesn't want that,
and neither do I.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.500
Michael, Michael
buys them for me.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.700
Mother doesn't know.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.200
She doesn't like me to have candy,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.800
 because
she thinks the sugar excites me,

01:30.800 --> 01:32.800
but Michael knows
they make me happy.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.400
He let's me have two a day.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.600
He counts them every day
to make sure that's all I have,

01:36.600 --> 01:38.700
but I've only had one today,
Father,

01:38.700 --> 01:40.500
and I want you
to have the other.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.300
Hail Mary full of grace,

01:49.300 --> 01:50.200
the Lord is with thee.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.600
Blessed art thou among women

01:51.600 --> 01:53.500
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.100
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for our sinners now

01:56.100 --> 01:57.700
and at the hour of our death.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.600
Amen.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.100
Hail Mary, full of grace...

03:06.800 --> 03:07.700
Hey.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.300
Hey

03:09.300 --> 03:11.800
Beds don't float,
do they?

03:11.800 --> 03:12.900
Excuse me?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.600
(sighs)
I mean, in your
experience,

03:15.600 --> 03:18.600
as a rule, beds don't
float in midair, right?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.300
Well, gosh, I would hope

03:20.300 --> 03:22.600
that in the 14 or so years
that we've been together,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.900
that once or twice
between the two of us,

03:24.900 --> 03:27.000
our bed might have
left the ground,

03:27.400 --> 03:28.700
but why do you ask?

03:29.100 --> 03:30.700
It's nothing. It's crazy.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.400
It's... it's stupid.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.800
What are you doing?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.200
I'm working on my résum?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.300
Something you want to tell me?

03:39.500 --> 03:41.700
Mm, yeah. No.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.200
You're gonna think this is nuts,
but I had a dream.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.800
Must be going around.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.500
You want to share?

03:50.900 --> 03:52.100
Mm...

03:53.100 --> 03:54.900
This thing going on
at work.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.600
In the dream?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
Uh, no, in real life.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.600
Um, I can't really talk
about it,

04:01.600 --> 04:03.400
but it's a tremendous
opportunity.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.500
And in the dream,
I go to my boss

04:06.500 --> 04:09.600
and I say, "Mr. Canty,
I want this opportunity.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.600
I want to run
this project."

04:11.700 --> 04:13.200
You know what
he says to me?

04:13.500 --> 04:17.100
He says to me, "Well, Joe,"I've just been waiting
for you to ask.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.800
If you want something you got
to stop dragging your feet."

04:20.000 --> 04:22.100
Wow, sounds like a good dream.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.000
Hey.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.400
The only man I know who starts
work earlier than I do.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.100
Yeah, well, ever since
they changed the rules,

04:31.100 --> 04:33.400
let people die 24 hours a day.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.100
Guess that's why they call it
the "graveyard shift."

04:36.100 --> 04:38.900
Ooh, graveyard shift. Very nice.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.900
(chuckles)
So to what do I owe
this pleasure?

04:44.300 --> 04:46.800
Got the call from the coroner
about 2:00 in the morning.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.700
Saw your picture
in his wallet.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.100
Apparently,
he was having dinner at the home of some
friends last night,

04:54.100 --> 04:56.600
went up to their study
to make a private call,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.600
slipped and fell
on the stairs,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.200
cracked his skull.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.800
He had already expired by the time
the paramedics got there.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.200
Are you, are you sure it's him?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.200
There's no question.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.400
How long did you guys
know each other?

05:14.800 --> 05:19.300
Armando and I met the first
minute of the first day

05:19.300 --> 05:20.400
of the first grade.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.700
You know what?
I'm, I'm just going to, uh...

05:26.300 --> 05:28.200
Sorry.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.400
ALLISON:
Did you give the kids
breakfast?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.700
I certainly did.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.400
Did you eat?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.100
I certainly did not.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.600
Nervous?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.400
(sing-songy):
You're gonna get it.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.300
You know, the Mars thing?

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
You're gonna get it.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.200
Your boss is going
to give it to ya.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.300
Who said anything about Mars?

05:50.700 --> 05:51.900
Okay, forget Mars.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.200
Mars, Venus, Jupiter--
whatever it is--

05:54.700 --> 05:57.100
you're gonna get it,
that's all.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.300
Allison Dubois has spoken?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.700
Mm-hmm.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.700
I'll be sure and tell my boss.

06:05.900 --> 06:06.900
Yeah?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Sorry, sir, I know
you asked not to
be disturbed.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.200
I just... thought
you might need this
for jury selection.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.300
I know you're
preparing.

06:20.300 --> 06:20.900
You don't have
to worry.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.500
There's no preparation
going on in here.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.900
I can't hold
a thought in my head.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.900
You can just leave 'em.
Thanks.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.100
Is everything all right?

06:31.400 --> 06:34.000
Ah... I lost an old friend
last night.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.200
I'm so sorry.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.000
It's okay. He lived a good life.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.000
Helped a lot of people.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.300
Tripped and fell down
a flight of stairs,

06:45.300 --> 06:46.700
cracked his skull.

06:48.900 --> 06:53.700
When we were kids,
I once saw him walk on his hands

06:53.800 --> 06:57.300
across a movie theater balcony
railing just to impress a girl

06:57.300 --> 06:59.000
that was sitting down below.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.200
Nobody does irony like God.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.100
Armando Aguilar...

07:07.200 --> 07:10.600
Uh, Father Armando Aguilar.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.100
Oh, my God.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.000
No, I know.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.700
Trust me. (chuckles)

07:16.700 --> 07:17.700
When we were growing up,

07:17.700 --> 07:19.000
you would have
never seen it coming,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.500
not in a million years.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.700
Safe-cracker, maybe.
Gigolo,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.600
well, he certainly
had the skill set,

07:24.600 --> 07:26.000
but Catholic priest?

07:26.900 --> 07:28.800
We're back to God and irony.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.400
Happened yesterday evening
at the Fitzpatrick estate.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.400
Fitzpatrick?

07:33.400 --> 07:35.300
Like the Fitzpatrick plaza?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.800
Yeah. Members of our parish.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.300
They must be
devastated.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.400
Oh. They've had a tough time.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.300
Their only child, a grown
daughter took ill last year,

07:44.300 --> 07:45.500
moved back in with them.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.800
And now this.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.900
I'm so sorry.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.200
So if anybody asks,
I'm in here working away.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.200
Absolutely, sir,
working away.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
Joe.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.900
Do you have a minute?

08:09.900 --> 08:10.700
Sure.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.300
The Mars project.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.800
Joe, there is no Mars project.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.200
(chuckles)
Of course there isn't.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.300
Uh, but if there were

08:24.300 --> 08:27.300
and if we were contemplating
being involved

08:27.300 --> 08:30.000
in the engineering
of the on-board systems,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.500
I would really like to throw
my hat in the ring

08:33.500 --> 08:35.799
to be considered
the project leader.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
You know
how this stuff works, Joe.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.700
We don't call the tune
on these sorts of projects...

08:40.700 --> 08:44.400
if there actually
are these sorts of projects.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.000
My Uncle Sam does.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.100
Well, let your uncle know
that I'm interested.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
So let me get this straight.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.300
You're happy because
you have a real shot at a job

08:54.300 --> 08:57.400
that doesn't exist on a project
that your firm isn't doing.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.600
I'm sorry.
I have no comment.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.300
You will never
get it out of me.

09:01.300 --> 09:05.100
You are a cagey one,
Mr. Dubois.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Very hard to read,
highly inscrutable.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.000
Oh, I beg to differ.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.800
You could scrute me
with a little effort.

09:15.400 --> 09:19.300
Scruting is a
definite possibility.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.300
Maybe I should have said
something.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
And the point of
telling your boss

09:25.500 --> 09:27.800
that you just saw his
newly-dead friend

09:28.300 --> 09:29.800
in a scene out
of the <i>Exorcist</i>

09:29.800 --> 09:30.600
would have been...?

09:30.600 --> 09:33.100
Okay, obviously, it wasn't
a literal dream.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.000
Obviously, that young woman's
bed didn't really float.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.900
I must have that dream
for some reason,

09:38.900 --> 09:39.900
don't you think?

09:42.300 --> 09:43.600
Hello?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.800
Sorry, honey, I just got
an e-mail from Marcus.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
"Dear Joe, I've
just been informed

09:47.000 --> 09:49.200
"that a government polygraph
examiner will make himself

09:49.200 --> 09:52.800
"available at our offices
tomorrow afternoon

09:52.800 --> 09:53.900
"to administer
a test to you

09:53.900 --> 09:55.400
"as part of your
pre-qualification

09:55.400 --> 09:58.000
"for certain programs our
company may participate in

09:58.000 --> 10:00.300
"on the government's
behalf in the near future.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.800
"If for some reason
tomorrow afternoon"does not work for you,

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
please let me know
so that I..."

10:05.800 --> 10:06.800
Is everything all right?

10:07.100 --> 10:10.100
Yes, actually, I think
everything is very right.

10:10.900 --> 10:11.900
Mars...

10:11.900 --> 10:13.400
Stop that.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.200
Help me.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.700
Give me strength.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.500
What are you doing?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.800
I'm looking
for something.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.700
It's 4:30 in
the morning.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.800
Hey, this is the girl I saw,
the one with the floating bed.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.000
Colleen Fitzpatrick.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
She's the one the priest
was praying with the night that he died.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.700
This is a picture
from her wedding in 2003 before she took ill.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.400
Pretty girl.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.100
I wonder if she
can do that thing

11:58.100 --> 12:00.400
where she makes her head
spin all the way around?

12:02.700 --> 12:04.000
What? You told me last
night you thought

12:04.000 --> 12:07.300
that this girl might
believe she had a
demon inside her?

12:07.300 --> 12:10.700
It seems like a perfectly
legitimate question to me.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.300
There are no such thing
as demons.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.400
Said the psychic who
talks to ghosts.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.900
Are there things that exist,
lie beyond this world?

12:17.900 --> 12:19.100
Yes, absolutely.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.400
Demons aren't one of them.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.800
Okay, fine, demons
don't exist.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.900
This girl does.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.500
What's the big deal?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.200
Well, the police are calling
the priest's death an accident.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.900
It didn't look
that way to me.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.100
It looked to me like
Colleen Fitzpatrick might have killed him.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.800
Fitzpatrick?

12:34.300 --> 12:36.200
The department
store Fitzpatricks?

12:37.400 --> 12:40.000
They're members
of Devalos' parish.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.700
The same one the dead
priest worked at?

12:43.300 --> 12:44.400
Mm.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.400
Oh, I wouldn't want
to be them at the
next church picnic.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.200
Sir?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.600
I know you're on your way
into court,

12:52.600 --> 12:54.400
but I was afraid if I didn't
speak with you...

12:55.100 --> 12:56.300
You holding up okay?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.700
I didn't sleep
much last night,

12:57.700 --> 13:00.100
but I guess that's
to be expected.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.600
I tried putting the
time to good use.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.000
I started working on a
eulogy for Father Armando.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.600
Actually, he's the reason
I wanted to speak with you.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.500
Oh?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.800
I'm not certain that your
friend's fall was an accident.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.000
I'm guessing that
I'm not the only one

13:14.000 --> 13:15.600
who didn't sleep
well last night.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.700
You said the Fitzpatrick's
daughter wasn't well?

13:18.900 --> 13:22.700
Colleen. She had some sort
of breakdown last year.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.400
I don't know the specifics,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.900
but I seem to recall
that it was serious enough

13:25.900 --> 13:28.500
for her husband to consider
institutionalizing her.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.600
But Colleen's mother
wouldn't hear of it.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.100
They moved in with her,

13:32.100 --> 13:34.100
and she's been caring
for her ever since.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.800
What does this
have to do with...

13:35.800 --> 13:37.600
Do you know if she's
prone to violence?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.100
Colleen's mother, Helen,
showed up for Mass

13:41.100 --> 13:43.300
a few months ago with
her arm in a sling.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.900
No one actually said it,
but the sense I got

13:46.900 --> 13:50.800
is that it had to do with...
caring for her daughter.

13:51.900 --> 13:52.700
Are you implying...

13:52.700 --> 13:56.100
I think that he was struck
in the head before he fell
down those stairs.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.200
He was hit with something,
I don't know what it was.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.500
Something heavy.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.600
He was your friend.

14:04.200 --> 14:08.000
I just... I think you need
to ask some more questions.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.000
Is your name
Joseph Pritchard Dubois?

14:17.400 --> 14:18.800
Yes, it is.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.300
Are you an employee
of Aerodytech?

14:22.400 --> 14:23.700
Yes, I am.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.200
Have you ever discussed
confidential work matters

14:28.200 --> 14:30.000
with anyone
outside the company?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.500
No, I have not.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.200
Are you married?

14:34.300 --> 14:35.900
Yes, 13 years.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.500
Just a yes or no,
please.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.800
Right. Sorry.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.700
Do you ever work
on company projects while at home?

14:44.200 --> 14:46.200
Sometimes-- yes.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.100
Is there any way
anyone at home

14:49.100 --> 14:52.900
could gain unauthorized access
to company information?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.400
No.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.300
Let's take that one again.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.900
(softly):
Oh. Manuel.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.100
Helen.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.600
I hope you'll forgive
the mess,

15:10.600 --> 15:12.700
but we had a small army
of policemen

15:12.700 --> 15:15.500
pass through her the night
of Father Armando's accident.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.200
MAN:
Helen, have you seen
Colleen's new prescription?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.100
I thought I saw it

15:19.100 --> 15:22.000
in the upstairs bathroom last
night, but now I can't seem...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.500
Oh, sorry.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.900
I didn't realize
you had company.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.100
Oh. Michael, you remember
our old family friend,

15:28.100 --> 15:29.700
District Attorney
Manuel Devalos.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.600
Right. Of course,
from the wedding.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.200
Good to see you again, Michael.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.000
Anyway, I'll keep looking
for those pills upstairs.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.300
Actually, Michael,
if you have a moment.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.500
I'm here on business, business
that involves you and Helen.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.400
Just a few follow-up questions
regarding the statements

15:44.400 --> 15:46.100
you gave the police
the other night.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
Would now be a good time?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.600
Well, it was
a little after 9:00,

15:50.600 --> 15:54.100
and we had just finished
our meal, when Father Armando

15:54.100 --> 15:56.300
told me that he had
to make a private call.

15:56.600 --> 16:00.300
And so I told him he
was welcome to use
the study upstairs.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.300
And, uh, I was fixing
a cup of tea,

16:04.300 --> 16:05.500
and Michael
was in the cellar

16:05.500 --> 16:09.100
replacing a bottle of wine
that we hadn't opened.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.200
And there was this
terrible crash from the foyer,

16:12.200 --> 16:14.100
and I raced in
from the kitchen.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.300
(softly):
And... he was at the bottom
of the stairs.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.200
Alone?

16:21.500 --> 16:22.700
Alone?

16:22.700 --> 16:24.500
There was no third party
in the room?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.600
No one other than you
and Armando?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.800
That's correct.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.300
May I ask where Colleen was
when this was happening?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.300
She was in her
room, sleeping.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.900
The commotion
didn't wake her?

16:38.600 --> 16:41.100
She'd had a very
challenging day.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.300
We'd given her a little
something to help her sleep.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.800
Is something wrong,
Manuel?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.400
I've just come from
the Medical Examiner's office.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.400
I asked them to take a second
look at Armando's injuries.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.400
They now feel that he may have
sustained a blow to the head

16:59.400 --> 17:02.100
 <i>before</i> he fell
down your stairs.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
I don't understand.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.599
How can they
say one thing one day

17:08.599 --> 17:11.400
and then something completely
different the next?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.599
They also found
a partial fingerprint

17:13.599 --> 17:16.099
in a spot of blood
on the good Father's forehead.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.700
I'm sure you'll both recall
that Colleen was arrested

17:18.700 --> 17:22.599
for erratic driving shortly after she took ill
13 months ago.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.599
We ran the fingerprints
we had on file for her

17:26.599 --> 17:28.600
against the one we found
on Armando,

17:28.600 --> 17:31.800
and I'm sorry to say
it was a perfect match.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.200
ALLISON:
 <i>Absolutely.</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:35.200
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
Devalos?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.900
(sighs)
Colleen Fitzpatrick
did kill Father Armando.

17:40.900 --> 17:41.900
They found the murder weapon

17:41.900 --> 17:44.300
at the top of the stairs on a
table-- it was a wooden bookend.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.500
Ouch.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Her mother and her husband found
her standing over the body.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.700
They knew about it
the whole time.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.600
So what happens now?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.100
Everyone goes to jail?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.600
No. Devalos feels like
the family's suffered enough.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.100
He's not going to charge them
with obstruction.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.900
And if the girl's
found incompetent,

18:01.900 --> 18:03.500
she won't even
stand trial.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.400
Her psych evaluation
is tomorrow.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.400
I hope I did
the right thing.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.600
What are you
talking about?

18:13.100 --> 18:15.100
I don't know,
maybe it's my imagination,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.800
it just... sounded like Devalos

18:18.800 --> 18:22.600
was sadder
now that he knows the truth.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.500
I think he preferred it
when he thought

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
his friend's death
was a simple accident.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.800
(sighs)
This is one of those moments

18:30.800 --> 18:34.300
I'm not sure that my gift
is such a gift.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.800
I know what you mean.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.100
Can I ask you something?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.900
Are you sure I'm going
to get this thing?

18:43.300 --> 18:45.200
What thing?
What are you talking about?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.000
The promotion?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.600
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.400
At least
I think I'm sure. Why?

18:50.400 --> 18:52.700
It's just that
everything was going
fine this morning.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.600
I was doing great, and
then, the polygraph guy

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
starts asking me
questions about home

18:56.600 --> 18:58.200
and if there was any
way that anyone here

18:58.200 --> 19:00.400
could find out things
that they shouldn't know,

19:00.600 --> 19:03.000
and then I remembered what
happened the other morning.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.400
What happened
the other morning?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.600
You remember--
what you said

19:05.600 --> 19:07.000
when you were getting
out of the shower?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.400
What did I say?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.600
I'm not going to say; I'm
not going to remind you.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.400
That would just
defeat the whole point.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.200
What point?

19:13.200 --> 19:14.700
I don't know what
you're talking about?

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
You talking about
that joke I made about you going to Mars?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
Shh.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.400
What "shh"?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.500
Who could hear us?

19:22.000 --> 19:22.600
Wait a second.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.500
Are you really going
to Mars?

19:24.900 --> 19:26.100
I don't know.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.800
Based on the way today
went, probably not.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.800
Is that what this
is all about?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.200
That I guessed right?

19:38.600 --> 19:39.200
Guess?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.500
You're telling me
that was a guess?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.500
No, it's worse than that.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.000
It wasn't even a guess.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.700
It was a joke.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.900
A joke?

19:47.900 --> 19:48.800
You're kidding.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.400
A joke?

19:54.900 --> 19:56.400
HELEN:
 <i>What was that noise?</i>

19:59.200 --> 20:00.600
(in distance):
Is everyone okay?!

20:03.800 --> 20:05.100
Oh, my God.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.300
Oh, my God, Colleen,
what have you done?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.200
Answer me, Colleen.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.400
What have you done?

20:10.700 --> 20:11.800
Oh, my God.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.000
Father, you're going
to be okay.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.200
We're going
to get you some help.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.100
Michael! Where are you?

20:17.100 --> 20:19.200
We need to call 911.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
WOMAN:
Please, Colleen, I know
it's hard, but I need you

20:34.400 --> 20:36.300
to sit and concentrate.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.900
No. N-N-N-N-No. No.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.800
I need you
to tell us

20:50.800 --> 20:52.200
what was going
through your mind

20:52.200 --> 20:54.200
when you hurt
Father Armando.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
I didn't hurt Father Armando.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.700
You did, Colleen.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.900
You hurt him very badly,
and you know that.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.500
No, you're wrong.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.000
I didn't do anything.

21:12.700 --> 21:16.500
Are you trying to tell us
that somebody else hurt him?

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
The demon inside you?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.700
It's okay, Colleen,
you can tell us.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.600
We're your friends.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.600
I can see your words,
you know.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.100
I can see them.

21:32.600 --> 21:36.300
How dark they are,
how twisted.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.100
Like a long, black ribbon.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.500
Please, Colleen, don't.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.200
I know you now.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
I know who you are.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The great whore.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.800
The great whore
that sitteth
Colleen, sweetie, you need

21:48.800 --> 21:50.100
upon many waters
to calm down
right now, okay?

21:50.100 --> 21:50.900
with whom the kings
of the earth

21:50.900 --> 21:52.900
have committed fornication.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.500
I know you, whore!

21:54.500 --> 21:56.000
I can see your words.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.400
I can see them all,

21:57.400 --> 21:58.900
whore, I can
see them.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.200
WOMAN:
 <i>Colleen has been getting worse</i>

22:00.200 --> 22:02.700
the last few weeks,
more delusional

22:02.700 --> 22:04.900
more violent
during our sessions.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.500
You've been treating
her for how long now?

22:06.500 --> 22:07.800
13 months.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.200
Then she wasn't
under your care prior to her breakdown?

22:11.300 --> 22:12.700
It's my understanding,
Mr. Devalos,

22:12.700 --> 22:13.900
that prior
to her breakdown,

22:13.900 --> 22:16.100
Colleen was a perfectly happy
and healthy woman

22:16.100 --> 22:19.700
with no need whatsoever
for somebody in my line of work.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.400
I'm sorry to say

22:21.400 --> 22:24.300
I never had the pleasure
of meeting that Colleen.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.400
It sounds like she changed
pretty suddenly.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.800
About a year
and a half ago,

22:27.800 --> 22:29.100
Michael came
home from work

22:29.100 --> 22:31.600
and, apparently, she was
hysterical, terrified.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.400
She had called the police
thinking that she had seen

22:33.400 --> 22:36.400
something monstrous
in her house, some
sort of creature.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.300
Demonic creature?

22:38.300 --> 22:39.800
There's always been
a religious theme

22:39.800 --> 22:41.500
to Colleen's
hallucinations--

22:41.700 --> 22:43.400
demons, possession.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.300
I tend to attribute
it to the fact

22:45.300 --> 22:47.800
that she was such
a devout woman
before she took ill.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.900
But you were the one who
diagnosed her, correct?

22:50.900 --> 22:52.700
Undifferentiated
schizophrenia.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.000
Yes, that's true, but
to be perfectly honest,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.800
it's a bit of a catchall
as far as diagnoses go.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.600
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.000
It's used
when the patient's symptoms very clearly point
to schizophrenia,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.100
but are so clouded

23:05.100 --> 23:08.100
that classifying the type
of disorder is very difficult.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.000
If I may ask you,
Dr. Randall,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.400
what's so cloudy about
Colleen's symptoms?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.500
She's prone
to delusional episodes

23:14.500 --> 23:17.400
but has long stretches
of lucidity in between.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.200
True schizophrenia
doesn't work that way.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.000
It's far more
consistent.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.800
I've also given her any number of neuroleptics--

23:23.900 --> 23:26.300
drugs that should treat
the symptoms of schizophrenia--

23:26.300 --> 23:28.600
but none of them seem
to have any effect on her.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.200
I'm sure there's some sort
of explanation for this,

23:32.200 --> 23:34.900
but I haven't
been able to find it

23:36.700 --> 23:38.200
Hey.
Hey.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.600
You know that project
that we're not doing to do?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.000
The one I can't speak
to you about?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.600
You should just forget about it.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.700
Whoa. Wait a second, Marcus.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.200
Your wife.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.900
She's some type
of consultant, right?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.900
Has something to do
with the government?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.800
She works part time for the
District Attorney's office.

24:05.700 --> 24:06.700
Why?

24:06.900 --> 24:09.000
I don't know, but she's
a red flag for them,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.600
a big red flag.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.400
The polygraph
examiner picked up

24:12.400 --> 24:14.800
some deception when you
were asked about her.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
And now, they've
considered her to be,

24:16.800 --> 24:19.000
uh, some sort
of security risk.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.100
That is absurd.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.900
Doesn't matter. There isn't...

24:22.000 --> 24:23.800
such a project.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.400
It's not like you had
something that you lost.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.700
It was never here
for you to have.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.900
Wait, what? Marcus?

24:34.300 --> 24:35.900
This is not the end
of the conversation.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.600
Surely, there must be some
kind of a work-around.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.400
A work-around for a government
security clearance?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.500
I don't think so.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.900
Well, think harder, Marcus.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.800
You know what an asset
I would be to this.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.700
L-Let me take, let me
take the test again.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.500
This is not like something
that you can cram for, Joe.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.900
You're either telling
the truth or you're not.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.500
Of course I'm telling the truth.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.100
Well, I know one expert
who disagrees.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.600
I've worked for this
company for 15 years.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.800
I've never put
them at risk.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.900
This is not
the company talking.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.900
All right, fine,
but there must be a
call that you can make.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.600
Isn't there a string
that you can pull?

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
Please.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.900
ALLISON:
 <i>It's 'cause of me, isn't it?</i>

25:12.300 --> 25:15.600
They can sense that you can sense that
I might be able to...

25:16.600 --> 25:18.300
rifle through your thoughts

25:18.300 --> 25:19.700
if I wanted to?

25:21.100 --> 25:22.900
Hmm... I don't know.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.400
They sense something.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.800
Funny thing is...

25:30.700 --> 25:32.400
I don't know
what this project is.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.200
I know it has something
to do with Mars.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.700
Beyond that...

25:38.800 --> 25:41.100
I know it has something
to do with space.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.000
I know what space
means to you.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.200
I remember
the night we met.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.800
You picked me up
at that bar,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.400
you brought me
back to your place,

25:53.400 --> 25:56.300
showed me your...
telescope.

25:56.900 --> 26:01.600
You showed me your books
on the cosmos.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.600
You showed me your lunch box
from the third grade

26:04.600 --> 26:06.800
with rockets and planets.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.700
And you thought,
"What a nerd."

26:09.100 --> 26:10.600
And I thought...

26:11.400 --> 26:13.700
"I think I have
to sleep with this man.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.500
I think I might have
to marry this man."

26:19.600 --> 26:23.300
And now it's me standing between you
and your other love.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.300
I love you.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.400
And I love you.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.900
HELEN:
 <i>Michael, is that you?</i>

26:47.900 --> 26:49.100
Hey, sorry I
missed dinner.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.600
I got pulled into
a late meeting.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.200
Don't give it a second
thought, dear.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.400
I made you a plate
and put it in the fridge.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.500
Oh, thanks.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.100
Was that Father Armando's
car I saw in the driveway?

26:59.300 --> 27:01.300
(phone ringing)
Yes, he's upstairs
visiting Colleen.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.500
Don't you need to get that?

27:05.200 --> 27:05.800
Work.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.200
They can call me on
the landline if they
really need me.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.600
FATHER ARMANDO:
...pray for us sinners now

27:12.700 --> 27:15.000
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.500
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.700
Blessed art thou
among women

27:18.700 --> 27:20.500
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.100
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

27:23.100 --> 27:25.600
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.900
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.200
Blessed art thou
among women 

27:29.200 --> 27:31.200
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.700
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.300
Hail Mary,
full of grace...

27:39.700 --> 27:42.000
Dr. Elizabeth Randall, please.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.600
Thank you.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.500
Hey. Sorry I couldn't answer.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.900
Mother Fitzpatrick was standing
right in front of me.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.000
Yeah, she's got
the priest here again.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.900
Guess she still thinks
the power of prayer is going to make a difference.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.100
Honestly, darling?

28:00.100 --> 28:01.300
I don't know what it's going
to take to get Helen

28:01.300 --> 28:02.500
to put Colleen in a home.

28:04.700 --> 28:08.300
Yeah, well... I miss you, too.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
If Helen turns in early,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.500
maybe I'll try to swing
by your place later.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.200
FATHER ARMANDO:
Oh, dear God, no!

28:13.700 --> 28:15.600
Something's up.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.800
Give me strength.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.200
What is it, Father?

28:29.100 --> 28:30.200
Her bed.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.800
It's floating.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.600
Do you see it?

28:35.700 --> 28:37.500
Michael, do you see it?!

28:45.500 --> 28:48.800
Having an affair with
your wife's physician is not against the law.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.400
I mean, it's not nice, but
it's not against the law.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.000
At least I don't
think it is.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.900
How's this?

28:56.900 --> 28:58.200
Does this look honest?

28:58.200 --> 29:00.900
Yes, you look honest,
you look thoroughly honest.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.700
'Cause you are honest.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.300
So be honest and tell me what do
I do about this bed thing?

29:05.300 --> 29:07.900
Do I tell Devalos?
Tell Devalos what?

29:07.900 --> 29:10.800
That in your dream his
friend was having delusions

29:10.800 --> 29:12.800
about free-floating furniture?

29:12.800 --> 29:13.900
I mean, if you tell him that,

29:13.900 --> 29:16.000
he's gonna send you
home for the day.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.300
(sighs)
I, uh... I think it's over.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.100
You know who died,

29:21.100 --> 29:23.000
and you know how
it happened.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.200
You know everything.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.500
Okay, then why do I keep
dreaming about all of it?

29:27.300 --> 29:28.900
(sighs)
That I don't know.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.200
Okay. Look, I know you have
other things on your mind.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.500
I know you think this horse
is already dead

29:34.500 --> 29:37.300
and you can't figure out
why I keep beating it.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.800
No.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.600
Well, yeah.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.600
I'm sorry, I'm
nervous about today.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.400
I'm just starting to think

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
that I should have forgotten
about the whole thing.

29:47.300 --> 29:50.100
You know,it's not a test test,
it's a lie detector test,

29:50.100 --> 29:51.700
and I failed, and I don't
know what made me think

29:51.700 --> 29:55.000
that I would pass it if I
got a second shot at it.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.400
Okay. Well, if you know that...

29:58.600 --> 29:59.100
What can you do?

29:59.100 --> 30:02.300
You in there and...
tell the truth.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.500
I mean, really,
what else can you do?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.000
You go in there
and you tell them the truth.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.800
And after that,
it's out of your hands.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.200
What?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.700
It's not like I didn't tell
the truth the first time.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.700
Fine. If you say so.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.100
ADMINISTRATOR:
 <i>Is your name</i>
 <i>Joseph Pritchard Dubois?</i>

30:23.400 --> 30:24.400
Yes.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.600
Have you ever discussed
confidential work matters

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
with anyone
outside the company?

30:30.600 --> 30:32.100
No, I have not.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.100
Is there any way
anyone at home

30:36.100 --> 30:38.000
could gain
unauthorized access

30:38.000 --> 30:39.900
to company information?

30:47.300 --> 30:50.100
Is there any way
anyone at home

30:50.100 --> 30:52.000
could gain
unauthorized access

30:52.000 --> 30:53.400
to company information?

30:55.200 --> 30:56.800
Yes.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.600
Yeah, I suppose there is.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.800
I'm sorry, did you

31:03.800 --> 31:05.800
just answer
in the affirmative?

31:05.900 --> 31:08.900
Yes. Yes, I did.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.500
You're saying
that there is a way

31:12.500 --> 31:14.900
that someone could gain
unauthorized access

31:14.900 --> 31:16.500
to company information,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.600
but you don't discuss

31:18.600 --> 31:20.800
confidential matters
outside the office?

31:20.800 --> 31:22.100
That's correct.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.200
Is this person
in question your wife?

31:28.500 --> 31:31.400
Yes. Yes, it is.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.100
Is she a computer hacker?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.000
No.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.700
Do you talk in your sleep?

31:40.700 --> 31:41.800
No.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.300
Can she read your mind?

31:47.300 --> 31:48.500
Yes.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.900
As a matter of
fact, she can.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.100
She can read your mind?

31:58.200 --> 31:59.900
That's correct.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.300
She can pluck thoughts
from your head?

32:04.500 --> 32:07.400
Your wife possesses
psychic abilities.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.100
Yes.

32:10.700 --> 32:13.100
So, Mr. Dubois,

32:13.100 --> 32:15.600
you're telling me
that your wife

32:15.800 --> 32:17.400
finishes your sentences

32:17.400 --> 32:20.800
and, um, can often tell
when you're lying,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.100
that sort of thing?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.500
That's correct.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.600
Well, what do you know?

32:29.600 --> 32:31.600
My wife is psychic, too.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.800
Thank you very much.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.000
We're done here.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.600
Did I pass?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.600
Well, why don't you call
your wife and ask her?

32:46.900 --> 32:47.900
Talk to me.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.200
JOE:
You were right.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.200
So I take it the truth
set you free.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.400
It certainly felt a lot better
the second time around.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.800
So now I guess we just
hold our breath.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.600
What for? You got it.
I'm sure of it.

33:01.900 --> 33:05.100
Hmm. From your lips
to Uncle Sam's ear.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.600
You sound like
you're in the car.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.300
I'm playing messenger girl.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.300
Devalos had some papers
that he needed

33:10.300 --> 33:12.400
Dr. Randall to sign
at the institute.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.200
I offered to run them
over there.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.200
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

33:16.200 --> 33:18.500
Oh, out of the badness
of my...

33:18.500 --> 33:20.700
what, I don't know, dirty mind?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.200
I just want to look her
in the eye.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.200
It seems like a dangerous
conflict of interest to me.

33:26.300 --> 33:29.100
I mean, she's sleeping
with that poor woman's husband.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.100
Well, just remember,
it may mean nothing at all.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.300
(sighing):
Yeah. Well, I hope so.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.200
Mrs. Dubois, right?

33:47.600 --> 33:50.000
Oh, y-yes. Hello again,
Mr. Barlow.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.100
I was just dropping these
papers off for Dr. Randall.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.500
The nurse at the front desk
told me I could find her here.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.900
Oh, she had to take a call.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.500
She said she'd be right back.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.400
You're welcome to wait
if you'd like.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.400
ALLISON:
How's she doing adjusting to her
new surroundings?

34:12.699 --> 34:14.400
Uh, it's hard to say.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.600
Dr. Randall prescribed
some new sedatives.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.300
She's been sleeping a lot.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.900
Sorry, again,
about yesterday.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.000
I'm sure that wasn't
an easy thing to watch.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.400
You know what they say--
everything happens for a reason.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.800
As it goes,
I think it's exactly

34:30.800 --> 34:32.699
what the district attorney
needed to see.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.800
Made it easy for him
to recommend that she

34:34.800 --> 34:38.000
be kept here, as opposed
to awaiting trial in prison.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.699
You're right-- everything
happens for a reason.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.100
NURSE:
Mr. Barlow?

34:44.600 --> 34:47.100
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to take these.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.600
Take them?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.800
We have a very
strict policy here regarding outside food.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
I'm sorry.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.699
Yeah, but they're not food.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.400
I mean, not technically.
They're candies.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.700
My wife has one
or two every day.

34:57.700 --> 34:59.200
She really
looks forward to them.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.100
I'm sorry,
there can be no exceptions.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.000
No, wait a second.
You're not listening to me.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.600
My wife needs those.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.500
They're a great
comfort to her.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
I only had one today, Father.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.800
I want you to have the other.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.100
RANDALL:
Is there a problem here?

35:15.900 --> 35:17.100
NURSE:
I was just explaining

35:17.100 --> 35:20.200
to Mr. Barlow that we don't
allow outside food 

35:20.200 --> 35:21.700
under any circumstances.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.900
And I was just explaining to her
that it's very important

35:23.900 --> 35:26.800
that my wife have a piece
of candy to look forward to every day.

35:27.900 --> 35:31.100
I think we can make an exception
just this once, don't you?

35:31.400 --> 35:32.100
But, Dr. Randall...

35:32.100 --> 35:33.400
They're nothing, nurse.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.200
Just little balls
of sugar.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.300
I don't see how
they could do any harm.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.200
You're the doctor, Doctor.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.200
NURSE:
Excuse me.

35:48.300 --> 35:49.700
What if I told you
I have reason to believe

35:49.700 --> 35:52.400
that Colleen Fitzpatrick
isn't sick at all?

35:54.100 --> 35:55.700
I'm sorry--
you think she's faking?

35:56.100 --> 35:58.000
Let's just say I don't believe
that she's crazy,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.400
and I don't believe
she's possessed.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.300
?????

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Manny.

36:13.900 --> 36:15.600
Test results just came back.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.300
And?

36:17.700 --> 36:19.000
Allison was right.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.100
You want I should go
scoop these monsters up?

36:25.300 --> 36:26.500
Yeah.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.800
I do.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.200
No, Stanley,
 <i>you're</i> not listening.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.200
As of today, every account is
supposed to have my name on it.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.600
Yes, even Colleen's trust.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.900
Well, that's what
power of attorney means.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.400
Stanley, I'm going to have
to call you back.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.600
Michael Barlow?

36:47.600 --> 36:48.300
Yes.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.200
You're under arrest
for the murder of Father Armando Aguilar.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.400
You have the right
to remain silent.
What?

36:53.400 --> 36:54.900
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

36:54.900 --> 36:55.800
No, this is wrong.
in a court of law.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.700
My wife is the one
who killed Father Armando.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.200
...if you can't
afford an attorney,
That was Colleen.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.900
one will be
provided for you.
This is crazy.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.000
Crazy, huh?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.300
It's a good thing
I picked up a psychiatrist on
the way over here.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.600
Her name's
Elizabeth Randall.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.100
I think you
two have met.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.900
HELEN:
 <i>Lysergic acid?</i>

37:11.100 --> 37:12.300
LSD.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.200
We found significant
amounts of it

37:14.200 --> 37:17.000
in Father Armando's system
after we exhumed him.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.500
We're still running
Colleen's blood work,

37:20.500 --> 37:23.200
but I'm confident we'll
find it in hers as well.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.600
I don't understand, Manuel.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.300
Are you telling me
she isn't sick?

37:29.400 --> 37:32.400
It's our belief that
every last one of the symptoms

37:32.400 --> 37:35.300
she's experienced over the past
13 months-- the hallucinations,

37:35.300 --> 37:37.900
the paranoia,
the violent outbursts--

37:37.900 --> 37:39.600
were all drug-induced.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.900
The stretches
of lucidity between,

37:41.900 --> 37:45.300
the days that she would act
and sound like the old Colleen,

37:45.600 --> 37:48.300
those were just recovery periods
between dosings.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.100
But I've hardly ever left

37:52.100 --> 37:54.100
Colleen's side
this past year.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.800
I never saw Michael
give her a single pill,

37:57.100 --> 37:58.500
a single injection.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.400
It was the candies.

38:00.800 --> 38:04.000
He covered each one
with a liquid form of the drug.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.400
And by making them
her daily treat,

38:06.400 --> 38:08.700
he could count on her
self-medicating.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.500
The only thing he didn't
count on was Colleen.

38:11.500 --> 38:15.100
offering Father Armando a candy
during his last visit.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.500
We believe that Michael
killed the good Father

38:18.500 --> 38:21.400
because he knew that once
the effects of the LSD wore off,

38:21.400 --> 38:23.000
Armando would start
asking questions,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.800
probably realize
that Colleen was being dosed.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.100
But all those doctors
I took her to,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.000
all those specialists,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.300
why didn't they ever detect
the drug in her system?

38:32.300 --> 38:34.600
LSD doesn't show up
in most blood screenings.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.400
You have to know
that you're looking for it.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.700
You have to run
a very specific test.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.300
And the fact that Michael's
partner in crime, Dr. Randall,

38:43.300 --> 38:46.200
was Colleen's primary physician
didn't help matters any.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.300
She could always run
interference for Michael,

38:48.300 --> 38:51.000
throw any other doctors off the scent.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.100
And all this... cruelty

38:56.500 --> 38:58.900
just to get around a
prenuptial agreement?

39:01.400 --> 39:03.600
If Colleen had died
or divorced Michael,

39:03.600 --> 39:05.500
he would've ended up
with nothing.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.400
If she were to lose
her mind, however,

39:08.400 --> 39:11.800
be declared incompetent,
he could stay married to her

39:11.800 --> 39:14.200
and still have access
to your family's fortune.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.600
It's gonna be okay,
Helen.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.900
It's gonna be fine.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.600
Colleen's working the drug
out of her system

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
for the very last time,

39:23.600 --> 39:25.600
and it's my understanding
that once she does,

39:25.600 --> 39:27.400
she's going to make
a full recovery.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.400
You're going to get
your daughter back.

39:40.100 --> 39:41.600
So let me get
this straight.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.500
The reason we get to
stay up an extra half hour

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
and eat cake is because
Daddy got put in charge

39:45.500 --> 39:47.100
of some really
cool project.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.500
That is correct.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.800
Only you can't tell us
about this really cool project

39:51.800 --> 39:53.400
because it's top secret.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.300
That is also correct.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.800
Can we at least have a hint?

39:58.200 --> 39:59.900
ALLISON:
Okay, on that note,

39:59.900 --> 40:01.900
come on, you little
security risks.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.400
It's time
to hit the hay.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.300
Joe, you got Bridge?

40:04.300 --> 40:05.100
Yes.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.800
Come on, kiddo.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.300
Time for bed.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.800
But I don't want
to go to bed.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.000
I like staying up late.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Really? You got a funny way
of showing it.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.700
Congratulations
again, Daddy.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.100
If you can't get
that ship up to Mars,

40:21.100 --> 40:23.300
nobody can.
