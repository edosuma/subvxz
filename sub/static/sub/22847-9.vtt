00:01.168 --> 00:03.586
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.754 --> 00:07.049
What are they doing with the shard?
What the hell did you do to my father?

00:09.051 --> 00:11.846
The Destroyer of Worlds
has proven quite resourceful.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.180
<i>You wanna go after her?</i>

00:14.223 --> 00:17.268
<i>- My orders?</i>
- Show no mercy.

00:17.852 --> 00:18.853
Well, I think I know

00:18.936 --> 00:21.272
how they're creating
the artificial gravity for the station.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.649
Unless I'm mistaken
and I hope I am, that's...

00:23.816 --> 00:26.777
- Gravitonium.
- It's your life or the lives of billions.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.159
- Robin, stay back!
- I can't have you give her the answers.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.244
I raised you?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.079
Why me?

00:37.413 --> 00:40.666
<i>You always said, one day,
I could help save the world.</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:43.961
When you destroy the world,
you remember this moment.

00:44.462 --> 00:47.298
- Remember, I tried to stop you.
- I'm not leaving with you guys.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.675
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to come up with a plan, then, aren't we?

00:49.759 --> 00:52.887
If we want to survive, we can't let
Kasius pit us against each other anymore.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.889
All right.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.265
Who's first?

01:44.897 --> 01:45.940
Hold your fire!

01:47.191 --> 01:48.901
- Nice work.
- Yeah?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.946
Why does the guy named Gunner
get stuck throwing rocks?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.115
'Cause you're damn good at it.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.704
- Enemy of my enemy.
- Yeah, puts things in perspective.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.998
He's fighting for a good reason.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.168
For the record,
I like Rebel Peacemaker Mack, too.

02:06.836 --> 02:07.878
He's sexy.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.256
- Oh, is that right?
- Whoa.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.050
Two more Kreepers.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.303
This is our floor now. No Blues allowed.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.557
Hey, slow down, slow down.
We got a long way to go still.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.855
Smile, Turtleman. We did good.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.649
We got lucky.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.610
But now Kasius knows we're still here.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.948
- They'll be back.
<i>- The humans are alive?</i>

02:37.825 --> 02:40.786
- Impossible.
- They killed the Vrellnexians.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.330
And we lost eight soldiers.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.040
How can that be?

02:45.291 --> 02:48.085
The humans have guns.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.548
Where on this cursed rock
did they find weapons?

02:56.969 --> 03:00.598
If even one item doesn't make it
onto my ship whole,

03:00.764 --> 03:02.349
then I fear neither will you!

03:03.100 --> 03:04.226
Am I clear?

03:12.318 --> 03:13.527
Hmm.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.114
An uprising.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.453
Just as I'm on the verge of leaving
this place, Destroyer in hand.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.708
No matter.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.131
Have the doctor awaken
our latest acquisition.

03:35.341 --> 03:37.718
It's time to remind the humans
I am not their enemy.

03:38.761 --> 03:39.970
I am their God.

03:52.107 --> 03:56.278
This Inhuman boy, Flint,
you say his geokinesis

03:56.445 --> 03:59.240
is the key to building a new monolith,
to your returning home?

03:59.406 --> 04:03.035
Technically, Robin said it to May,
but yeah, that's the idea.

04:03.369 --> 04:06.205
And how exactly will that work?

04:06.455 --> 04:09.166
We have a monolith shard
that Simmons said has a unique,

04:09.416 --> 04:11.627
crystalline structure that he can...

04:12.086 --> 04:15.756
It's a rock.
Flint controls rocks. I don't know.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.884
Won't matter if we can't make it back
to the Lighthouse.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.595
Then we must hope he remains safe

04:21.762 --> 04:25.266
while we wait
out the intensifying gravity storm.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.351
- By my calculations...
- It'll last for weeks

04:27.518 --> 04:30.145
and we need to evacuate.
Right, you've been saying that.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.981
Kind of on repeat.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.568
Whatever you're doing,
do it faster. How we lookin'?

04:37.111 --> 04:42.700
Terrible. <i>Zephyr One's</i> been a crash-site
for going on 80 years, so, it's a mess.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.910
It's gonna be a while till comms
are up and running.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.331
'Cause I'm pretty sure, generations
of space rats have lived and died in here.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.750
Not to ruin the mood, but...

04:51.959 --> 04:53.168
...avionics are online.

04:54.253 --> 04:58.507
Agent Coulson, we are evacuating
to the caves for shelter, are we not?

04:58.674 --> 05:02.636
<i>- Zephyr</i> flies again, metal man.
- I am mostly plastic alloy.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.557
- And the Chronicoms do not have gender.
- We don't have weeks.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.852
We're gonna outrun the storm.
Pull the ground anchors,

05:10.019 --> 05:12.688
fly past as many Roaches as we can,
and land at the Lighthouse.

05:13.314 --> 05:17.151
You are confident, despite knowing
this will surely end in your deaths.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.237
We're not gonna bury our heads in the sand
while our friends are in danger.

05:26.285 --> 05:30.414
- Well, so much for avionics.
- Rerouting must have overloaded the MPDU.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.334
Need to try and bypass the subsystems.

05:34.126 --> 05:38.213
Hey, Plastic, make yourself useful.
Secure this in the back.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.551
Plastics are quite useful,
if not often appreciated.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.815
I'm sorry she had to go like that.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.276
You want to talk about it?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.070
I, um...

06:02.863 --> 06:03.947
don't know where to start.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.617
An old woman tells you
that she was your daughter

06:07.368 --> 06:09.787
and that you'll save the planet
from cracking apart.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.164
Doesn't happen every day.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.335
- It's hard to believe.
- That we can do it?

06:16.919 --> 06:19.505
That... I was a mum.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.507
I just...

06:22.883 --> 06:23.926
I can't see it.

06:24.635 --> 06:25.636
I can.

06:27.012 --> 06:32.810
Yeah. You'd be that no phone,
no TV, seven-thirty curfew kind of mum.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.775
You're kind of proving
my point with the face.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.320
For Robin's sake, we need to make
sure this world never comes to be.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.073
Yeah. No matter what.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.035
What are we gonna do with Voss?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.663
I left that up to Deke.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.389
You're upset.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.307
I don't blame you.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.726
Think about what you're doing here.

07:15.894 --> 07:16.895
You killed him.

07:19.148 --> 07:22.317
Me and Owen were lockstep
in almost everything.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.363
Always agreed to pull these people
out of the past, but once they got here,

07:26.655 --> 07:28.323
we never saw eye-to-eye on that.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.201
He thought they'd come
with some grand solution.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.537
I thought killing them was the solution.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.499
You know how stubborn
your old man could be.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.334
You were his best friend.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.670
Yeah.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.841
Up until the day he tried
to end that argument for good.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.720
Came at me with a knife
and the knife ended up in his throat.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.763
You know he was capable of it.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.685
It's not how I wanted it to go down,
but I did what I had to do.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.480
It was all for nothing.
You haven't done a damn thing.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.774
We survived a decade in this hellscape.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.111
You have no idea what we went through,
what we sacrificed for this.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.907
And now, the people
responsible are upstairs.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.285
We could finish it,
but you want to kill me?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.008
You're no killer.

08:29.801 --> 08:34.097
It's fine. Like your dad used to say,
"Play the long game."

08:36.600 --> 08:39.061
Kasius thinks Quake
is his ticket out of here.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.145
Let him have her.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.607
What's the worst that could happen?

08:45.943 --> 08:49.404
She goes back in time,
you already know what will happen.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.744
Breathe, relax, aim...

08:57.704 --> 08:58.705
slack...

08:59.998 --> 09:01.750
- squeeze.
- What's going on?

09:02.376 --> 09:04.836
Check it out, big man.
Yo-Yo's teaching me how to shoot.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.380
One step at a time, hot shot.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.968
Hey! Come on. You said yourself
the Blues are gonna come back.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.469
And when they do, we'll fight them.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.763
Not you.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.267
Look, you've seen what I can do.

09:18.934 --> 09:19.977
All right? I can help.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.981
We'll deal with it. End of discussion.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.609
Whatever, man.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.158
You know he can handle himself.
He's killed before.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.745
Yeah. But now he's developing
a taste for it.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.789
As long as he kills the bad guys.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.125
He's not a soldier, Yo-Yo.
None of these people are.

09:43.292 --> 09:47.212
- We can teach them. We took this floor.
- And there are dozens more full of people

09:47.379 --> 09:49.381
who have no idea
how to fight for one another.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.133
We need a plan, not a mob.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.052
Mack, Kasius sent a messenger.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.804
Hey, come on.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.230
All right, everyone,
back up! Make room!

10:11.361 --> 10:12.779
<i>Santo infierno...</i>

10:16.533 --> 10:17.534
No way.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.621
Tess?

10:25.584 --> 10:26.752
I thought you were dead.

10:30.881 --> 10:31.882
I was.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.389
I fought...

10:40.641 --> 10:41.642
then, I begged.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.227
They dragged me to the Exchange.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.981
Knives are cold.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.195
- It's okay, Tess. You're safe.
- But I don't feel the same.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.613
Well...

10:55.822 --> 10:57.574
- you've been put through a lot.
- Yeah, I was dead.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.080
And then screaming, my heart on fire.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.209
Kasius was there,
smiling.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.460
Is he magic?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.546
S.H.I.E.L.D. dealt with something
like this before.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.466
In our time, we've seen
Kree biology bring people back.

11:14.633 --> 11:15.884
How is that possible?

11:16.760 --> 11:20.514
Kasius said he'd "smothered
the fires of death,

11:21.264 --> 11:22.933
with the blood of the eternal."

11:25.102 --> 11:26.269
That's how he talks.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.399
- It's horrible.
- I'm so sorry, Tess.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.902
It was me who took Flint
from the ceremony.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.988
If I could do what you do,
I would've done the same.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.032
Look, I say we get in that elevator,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.702
- we go down there, and we kill them all.
- Pump the brakes, Pebbles.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.995
- We've been over this.
- I have powers.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.832
- You let me loose on this guy...
- Absolutely not!

11:46.998 --> 11:50.585
He's right. We take out Kasius,
this is over. He's just a man.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.796
No! Kasius is a God.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.967
That's why I'm standing here. As proof.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.803
There's only one God,
and he for damn sure ain't it.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.763
- So send me in.
- Just calm down, Yo-Yo.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.015
I'll kill the blue bastard
before he even knows what hit him.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.143
- And if he comes back to life, then what?
- I'll kill him again!

12:06.226 --> 12:07.519
It wouldn't be the strangest thing
I've done.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.770
And you don't get it!

12:09.771 --> 12:12.023
If I don't bring him everything he wants,

12:12.190 --> 12:14.735
he said he'd end the human race
with the push of a button.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.821
What does he want?

12:19.698 --> 12:20.699
You.

12:23.368 --> 12:26.037
Everything he needs
to keep breeding Inhumans,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.624
every child older than ten,

12:31.460 --> 12:34.379
and motivation for the Destroyer.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.215
- The Destroyer?
- Of Worlds.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.217
Your friend Daisy.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.013
- He's working to get her back.
- Motivation? You mean us?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.641
Or we all burn.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.738
- Everything okay, boss?
- Hand needed a little juice.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.365
Okay. Well, the comms are up and running.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.618
If we can get a line
of sight to the Lighthouse,

13:04.701 --> 13:07.746
we should be able to contact Mack and...

13:07.954 --> 13:09.206
the sooner the better.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.000
Once we're in, first thing
we do is get downstairs,

13:12.167 --> 13:14.252
remove your inhibitor,
get your powers back.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.713
Yeah.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.633
Maybe we don't.

13:21.092 --> 13:24.304
- I need you at full-strength.
- You have me, as an agent.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.389
- Daisy...
- You saw the video.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.935
I was there at the end of everything.
Can we really take that chance?

13:30.852 --> 13:33.605
- S.H.I.E.L.D. needs Quake.
- I'm just tired of these names.

13:33.772 --> 13:37.651
If I'm... if I'm not Quake,
I can't be the Destroyer of Worlds.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.196
Maybe I should just be Daisy Johnson,
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.498
Okay, Phil.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.252
Back to work.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.422
Ah! Damn it.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.591
Fitz, please be careful.

14:02.425 --> 14:06.721
Well... I'm not trying
to electrocute myself.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.724
But everything has been reconfigured,
so...

14:10.308 --> 14:13.270
- I don't even know what I'm looking at.
- Wait...

14:14.229 --> 14:15.230
I think I do.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.234
That's my design.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.236
Yeah, for the next-gen <i>Zephyr</i>. I remember.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.946
Complete with RCS thrusters.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.575
But that was purely theoretical.
It's useless without...

14:30.120 --> 14:31.496
artificial gravity.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.133
Oh.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.385
Had to be Gravitonium.

14:46.887 --> 14:51.057
Fitz, it's on the base.
It's here on the plane. It's everywhere.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.603
Flying in with Enoch, I was trying
to figure out how it was all possible,

14:54.769 --> 14:56.980
a planet this shape with atmosphere.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.025
Gravitonium would explain
why it's held together.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.527
And maybe why it was cracked apart.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.488
But it being here also means that...

15:06.907 --> 15:07.908
it's true.

15:09.117 --> 15:12.078
Robin, May... It's all true.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.041
This is the same design
from the Lighthouse, so unless

15:16.541 --> 15:20.462
someone else just happened
to come up with the exact same idea...

15:22.839 --> 15:23.882
we did this...

15:26.051 --> 15:27.177
in the past...

15:28.637 --> 15:30.472
after we've lived this moment.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.018
Yeah, the causal loop paradox.
We'd only...

15:35.685 --> 15:38.563
know how to design it
because we'd already seen it.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.609
- Well, we're done for. This is proof.
- Wha...?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.986
- I don't know if that's true.
- Yes, it is.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.449
Think about it.
There is nothing that we do that matters.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.368
This is a bloody time-loop.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.411
We're doomed to fail.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.539
If we did this, do you know what I see?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.459
Proof we make it back.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.556
I think that was a hospital.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.685
Is this your first time having
a building dropped on you?

16:16.851 --> 16:19.145
No.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.647
- Uh, okay.
- Yes. Yes,

16:20.814 --> 16:22.065
that's what I'm talking about.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.611
You were gone a long time.
Is Voss still among us?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.740
He knows stuff we don't.
I thought we might still need him.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.369
Ha! Yes!

16:36.454 --> 16:39.457
- Are the engines good to go?
- In theory, but, sir, we found something.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.711
<i>Zephyr One's</i> been upgraded significantly.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.257
- Will those upgrades help us take off?
- Uh, well, no.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.467
- 'Cause it's time to fly. May!
- Okay.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.554
Once we have ignition, be ready
to lift the ground anchors.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.016
Here we go.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.773
Oh, come on.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.236
- Talk to me, Fitz.
- Well, the engines just blew out, so,

17:08.403 --> 17:09.570
we can't take off.

17:10.030 --> 17:14.034
As was previously advised,
we should now evacuate to the caves.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.453
I'll go first.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.877
Look, we need to go to Kasius now.
We're out of time.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.296
No one's going anywhere until we know
exactly what we're up against.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.214
I'll go. He wants me. Hand me over.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.758
You always do.
This is always the same argument.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.761
- Zip-zip, I chop his head off, done!
- Yeah, count me in.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.054
You'll get yourselves killed.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.098
If we don't go,
he'll make every one of us a vacancy.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.808
With the push of a button, right?

17:40.310 --> 17:42.896
So how's he gonna do that? Best guess...

17:44.189 --> 17:46.816
he'd have a trigger installed
to remotely cut our oxygen.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.361
- Another reason to deal with him quickly.
- Humour me.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.496
- I don't see nothing.
- Please, I hate this, too,

17:59.704 --> 18:01.664
but we need to give Kasius
what he wants.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.211
- Maybe he's bluffing.
- He's wiped out floors before.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.215
His exact words were, "They'll all burn."

18:17.597 --> 18:19.849
"They'll all burn."

18:21.142 --> 18:22.185
Is that a bomb?

18:22.727 --> 18:25.230
Hard-wired directly
to the O2 lines for this floor.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.233
- That's pure oxygen.
- If there's one on every line

18:28.399 --> 18:30.735
and on every human floor,
there's got to be hundreds.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.570
Kasius could kill us in a flash.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.323
Not just kill.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.035
Incinerate.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.293
All right, time's up.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.338
- Move out.
- Let's go.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.261
Finally starting to get a hang
of this whole good-guy thing.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.849
Yeah, just in time for the sky to fall
and kill us all. Perfect timing, Deke.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.809
What makes you say that?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.563
Voss. You let him live.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.108
Doesn't mean I'm good.
Maybe I'm just spineless.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.069
Killing is never the better option.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.199
If it can prevent more pain, maybe.
I'm sure you've done it.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.334
My dad could be very violent,
but only when he needed to be.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.505
You learn that in the Lighthouse.
A life spent, a life earned.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.924
- Never a life saved?
- That's my point.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.386
Shouldn't I be able to pull the trigger
if I think that person could do more harm?

19:38.553 --> 19:40.638
I don't think Voss
is a threat to anyone, but me.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.768
Right. No, you're right.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.042
Get as far into the caves as possible.
We're right behind you.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.506
You here to waste me for good?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.342
That's not how I roll.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.638
But don't push your luck.
You're going into the caves. Turn around.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.390
That's why you fail.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.392
'Cause you're not willing
to do what has to be done.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.102
Clearly, you haven't read my file.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.189
We're not in the habit
of killing unarmed people.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.857
You think that was easy?

20:33.608 --> 20:34.651
She was a friend.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.488
You seem to be just fine
with the continents you'll let die.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.615
What makes you certain that we cause it?

20:41.950 --> 20:42.951
History.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.955
There was a light from the sky.
Aliens is what I heard.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.458
S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to stop it and failed.
Brought Hell to Earth.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.962
As cryptic prophecies go,
you'd give Robin a run for her money.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.713
That was from her.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.467
She said that was the start
and then your girl finished it.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.887
Sadly, you'll see for yourself.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.140
We need to go!

21:08.935 --> 21:10.937
- You waiting to get Daisy alone?
- Shut your trap.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.106
I'm not gonna do anything
to anyone, except maybe you.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.482
You keep telling yourself that,

21:14.649 --> 21:16.526
but you're not like them.
You'll do what's right.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.698
Now's the time, Deke. You should go, too.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.034
No, I've come this far.
I need to see it through.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.329
It's an impossible choice.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.332
As leaders of your floors,
we need you with us.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.169
This took me all of an hour
to disconnect,

21:35.878 --> 21:38.006
but it can't be disabled
and it's triggered remotely.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.139
Kasius' demands must be met.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.392
You want us to hand our kids
over to that lunatic? Hell, no!

21:49.559 --> 21:51.394
Even if we were crazy enough to do that,

21:51.686 --> 21:53.730
we can't trust Kasius
to hold his end of the bargain.

21:53.896 --> 21:57.108
Then we fight! Take him out!

21:57.317 --> 21:58.901
Suicide. He'll burn us all.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.487
- We'll fight!
- Listen!

22:03.990 --> 22:06.117
Yo-Yo and I are turning
ourselves over to him.

22:11.914 --> 22:14.083
- Kasius will kill you.
- Maybe.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.212
Or maybe we get close enough
to take him out of the picture.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.714
There's no other way.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.968
Now, you won't see us again.
But if we succeed...

22:26.346 --> 22:27.555
your children will be safe.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.559
The most important thing is
that you keep your heads down

22:32.018 --> 22:33.061
and keep working.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.438
Kasius is insane.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.400
If they fail, he'll invent
new ways to punish us,

22:39.817 --> 22:42.028
- to make us suffer.
- Don't go back.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.365
I could sneak you on another floor,
keep you safe.

22:45.740 --> 22:50.995
- Flint, there's nowhere to run.
- I can't lose you again, Tess.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.127
I don't have anyone else.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.593
I think you do.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.473
Look, let me go with you.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.727
- Let me fight.
- Look, there are other ways to fight.

23:15.770 --> 23:16.896
Remember, what we said.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.071
These people need you now.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.461
<i>Z-One</i> can't take much more of this!

23:40.628 --> 23:42.547
Let's just hope it's here
at all after the storm.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.761
The sensation of death is one
that I have yet to experience.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.763
Maybe I can help you with that!

23:52.181 --> 23:54.308
Almost everyone else is gone. Let's move!

24:07.738 --> 24:08.823
Cut the anchors.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.951
- Did she hit her head?
- Cut the ground anchors!

24:12.118 --> 24:14.662
Let a gravity wave take us.
That's how we get in the air.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.498
- We can't fly without engines!
- Maybe, we don't have to.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.459
- Simmons!
- The upgrades.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.794
<i>Zephyr One</i> has
Reaction Control System thrusters.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.755
- Meaning capable of manoeuvring in space.
- If we could get high enough,

24:24.922 --> 24:26.716
we could break
through Earth's diminished gravity.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.968
We could fly in space
straight to the Lighthouse.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.553
- Yeah.
- No, right?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.264
That's a bad idea, right?
Could that actually work?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.183
Assuming we don't get crushed by debris.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.601
- Slammed back to the ground.
- Or our thrusters

24:36.726 --> 24:38.394
- don't run out of power.
- And spin out into the void,

24:38.853 --> 24:40.938
- we're in!
- Same.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.774
I used to be really good
at self-preservation!

24:43.941 --> 24:46.444
May, can you pilot us
through a gravity storm?

24:47.445 --> 24:48.613
Another mum face.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.284
- You can do this. We can do this.
- Yeah, okay.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.745
When did you get so soft, Fletcher?

24:55.912 --> 24:57.538
Put your back into it! We got to go!

25:00.833 --> 25:03.336
Hey! You're going the wrong way.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.754
- We got to get underground.
- All right.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.466
All right. You're on your own.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.613
Your messenger has returned.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.700
Wonderful. Send them in.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.593
Alone?

25:58.558 --> 26:03.646
It appears I did not properly detail
the consequences of your failure.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.441
I'm sorry. I told them what you said,
but they wouldn't come.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.694
Perhaps you should burn
along with the rest of your kind,

26:09.860 --> 26:12.947
- coming to me empty-handed.
- I'm alone...

26:15.408 --> 26:16.909
but not empty-handed.

26:20.705 --> 26:23.916
- Where did you get those?
- I gave them your message.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.502
They insisted on sending one back.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.766
<i>They're holding your research floor
until you come and meet them.</i>

26:41.976 --> 26:43.019
Meet them?

26:44.520 --> 26:47.648
I will send a battalion
to grind their bones to dust.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.442
But that's the thing...

26:51.527 --> 26:52.945
<i>if you don't go and face them...</i>

26:53.779 --> 26:56.741
they'll burn your ability
to breed another Inhuman.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.581
<i>With "the push of a button."</i>

27:04.582 --> 27:06.125
That's how they wanted me to say it.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.680
Bring her.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.148
Coulson!

27:30.274 --> 27:33.152
Whoa. Yikes.
That is definitely gonna get infected.

27:33.903 --> 27:34.904
Are you okay?

27:35.488 --> 27:37.823
I've been worse,
but I've been better, too.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.577
As the gravitational forces accelerate,

27:41.744 --> 27:44.914
our chances of implosion
are rapidly increased.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.457
Tell me your primary function again.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.627
To observe and record
the evolution of your species.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.253
More observing, less sharing.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.465
Thrusters and artificial gravity
are ready!

27:54.632 --> 27:56.842
We'll have about ten minutes
of power to both!

27:57.009 --> 27:59.387
Don't fire the thrusters
until we're at the very edge

27:59.553 --> 28:01.889
of the atmosphere
or we will certainly die!

28:02.056 --> 28:04.600
Great. Everybody buckle in!

28:10.940 --> 28:13.776
No!

28:14.402 --> 28:16.112
- The anchors won't release.
- What?

28:16.570 --> 28:20.700
- The anchors are stuck. We can't lift off.
- I'm on it!

28:27.081 --> 28:29.125
Don't look at me like that.
We agreed to do this.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.253
- Yeah, as long as we keep our heads.
- We won't be the ones losing heads.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.880
Look, there's no way to know

28:35.423 --> 28:38.801
how Kasius activates his explosives,
so until we see the controls...

28:39.093 --> 28:42.096
"Don't do anything rash, stay calm
and don't kill anyone, Yo-Yo."

28:42.263 --> 28:45.015
- Yes, I remember your many stern warnings.
- Good.

28:45.474 --> 28:49.937
'Cause we both know, you don't exactly do
well around people like this.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.858
Evil men who kidnap and torment
defenceless women and children?

28:54.191 --> 28:55.609
No, I don't.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.653
I hope Flint's all right.

28:58.529 --> 29:01.073
- We put a lot on him today.
- The people like him.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.075
If anyone can keep
them together, it's him.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.285
He's a kid.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.580
Well, I wasn't much older
when I started out. He'll be fine.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.249
You know I'm right.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.836
Please.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.214
No promises.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.813
I got to say, that...
that's not what I pictured.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.232
Yo-Yo Rodriguez?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.111
- How peculiar.
- Says the space mime.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.238
Nobody moves!

29:42.406 --> 29:44.033
You think you're invincible.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.286
But in the end, you will submit.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.663
Give us the controls
to your explosives upstairs,

29:49.955 --> 29:53.167
- or your Inhuman-making days are over.
- Throw yourself at my feet

29:53.459 --> 29:56.045
and I will consider bringing you back
after having you slaughtered.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.464
Yo-Yo...

30:00.925 --> 30:02.384
We're not scared of you.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.846
You hide behind stronger men
and force them to do your bidding.

30:06.806 --> 30:10.142
- You're a coward.
- It's ironic, really.

30:10.810 --> 30:15.898
You would trade Inhumans for humans
when that very deal was brokered ages ago.

30:18.359 --> 30:22.530
In all my time here,
the one defining trait of your kind,

30:23.656 --> 30:26.075
you will always turn on one another.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.840
Turn, damn it!

30:55.855 --> 30:58.858
- Come on.
- Kasius misses you.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.654
May! Hit the gravity!

32:42.586 --> 32:45.381
If I had a stomach,
the vomiting would begin now.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.758
Thrusters? Talk to me, Fitz!

32:48.717 --> 32:50.844
- Ah!
- We're not high enough yet!

32:54.223 --> 32:56.392
This was a terrible idea! I'm sorry!

32:57.726 --> 32:59.937
You love forcing our choices,
so how does it feel

33:00.104 --> 33:01.647
to be on the other side, for once?

33:01.814 --> 33:03.941
Any moment now,
Sinara will secure the Destroyer

33:04.358 --> 33:06.402
and you will have no choice
but to surrender.

33:47.985 --> 33:53.574
Stand down or experience death
like your friend, many, many times.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.160
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

33:56.326 --> 33:58.412
I am a God to be feared.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.833
Humans beg to be ruled.
Without me, they'd have perished long ago.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.793
I guess you're not a New Testament guy.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.337
Vengeance and torment
are tools of the Devil.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.547
And of the weak.

34:09.797 --> 34:10.924
You want a devil?

34:11.842 --> 34:16.764
- I'll show you a hell you cannot imagine.
- You're no God, no devil.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.641
You're just a cruel, sad, little blue man.

34:20.184 --> 34:22.101
So why don't we skip
to the part where I end this?

34:42.414 --> 34:45.333
I'm not supposed to kill you.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.920
But oh, well.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.350
I knew I was going to regret this.

35:01.683 --> 35:06.021
Elena, spare the theatrics.
You wouldn't dare such a brazen attempt,

35:06.313 --> 35:09.983
not with the lives of your precious humans
dangling between us and the void.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.277
You really do talk funny.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.744
- Is it done?
- Do I get to fight now?

35:23.038 --> 35:24.832
Now that we're all here...

35:26.583 --> 35:28.252
is this what you were waiting for?

35:29.962 --> 35:34.174
Surrender or make your play.
Either way, you will be mine!

35:35.259 --> 35:36.301
I choose play.

35:41.098 --> 35:43.642
You didn't think I'd be ready for that?

35:45.352 --> 35:47.187
I promised suffering.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.941
Now, I make good on that promise.

35:56.363 --> 36:01.618
Okay! Okay! That is quite the jaw you got
there. Consider me impressed. Oh!

36:13.338 --> 36:15.007
- Now?
- Now!

37:11.730 --> 37:14.066
A sound plan, indeed.

37:27.788 --> 37:28.830
I'll do it.

37:29.373 --> 37:32.000
You'll set me back,
but you won't stop me.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.672
You forced my hand.
Remember, you did this!

37:42.594 --> 37:46.306
Let's go! That's all of them.
Let's go! Let's get upstairs!

38:24.553 --> 38:27.764
Tess said you were a slow talker,
so, we kind of leaned into that.

38:28.265 --> 38:29.266
You were stalling.

38:29.433 --> 38:32.060
Took some time to move
all of your explosives down to level 25.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.979
And you moved the people up.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.753
They all worked together,
every human floor.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.757
And now they're out of your reach.
Cut off, you Kreeper.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.051
- They're free.
- But not you!

39:05.052 --> 39:09.598
- For all of you, it's now over!
- Over? Oh, no, no, no, no.

39:10.724 --> 39:12.976
The ass-kicking's just begun.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.751
Mack, Yo-Yo, do you copy?

39:40.170 --> 39:41.838
Mack, Yo-Yo, do you copy?

39:42.798 --> 39:46.551
- Really? It's like a family heirloom.
- That we need in two places at once.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.513
Alphonso Mackenzie, do you copy?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.934
- Mack, can you hear me? Mack?
<i>- Tremors, thank God.</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:56.645
<i>- You all still in one piece?</i>
- More or less.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.230
It's good to hear your voice.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.442
Mack, we're on our way to you.
Do you have Flint?

40:02.651 --> 40:04.528
<i>Yes, we do. You got a plan?</i>

40:16.832 --> 40:18.708
- We spotted something that...
- Let me guess.

40:19.709 --> 40:24.214
The Destroyer and her friends are heading
here in an old S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.426
- Yes, but how do you...
- And they're nearing the landing pad?

40:28.093 --> 40:29.094
It appears so.

40:30.262 --> 40:33.473
Ready a squad. We will meet them there,

40:34.141 --> 40:36.685
and finish this once and for all.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.646
Kasius, apologies, but how did you know?

40:40.063 --> 40:42.023
They have a Seer
telling them what's to come?

40:42.691 --> 40:44.359
Well, I have one of my own.
