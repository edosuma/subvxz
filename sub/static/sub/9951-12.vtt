WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.703
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.497
- There are two
different Havens.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.461
There's the one that's right
beneath the surface

00:06.590 --> 00:08.455
and then there's one right
underneath that.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.707
- Lucy Ripley.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.174
You're the spitting image.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.213
- Is she your mother?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.586
- Why does everything
in this town

00:13.722 --> 00:15.303
have to be such a huge secret?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.047
Nathan really doesn't like you.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.846
- Everything about this guy
is a pain in my ass.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.013
- The guy's not all bad.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.386
- I've known him
since he was five.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.645
- You get a badge.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.730
You get to harass me.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.475
- Because you're
a lowlife criminal.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.522
- You're a smuggler.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.565
- I'm an importer.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.073
- Importing illegal goods.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.735
- Well, everything is illegal
somewhere.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.153
- This is not
about my job anymore.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.742
This is about me.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.409
This is about who I am
and where I've come from.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.452
I'm sorry, sir.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.496
I quit.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.181
- Oh! Jeezl

02:35.781 --> 02:38.818
- Do we really have a skeleton
inside a wrecked boat?

02:38.950 --> 02:42.818
Is there gonna be an eye patch
or a dead parrot?

02:42.954 --> 02:45.741
- That's life on
a seaside police force.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.375
What?
Do you miss the FBI already?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.581
- No.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.793
Just hope we get
a treasure chest.

02:51.922 --> 02:55.585
- I'm glad you're staying.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.378
You know, we used
to have pirates up here.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.593
Big enough storm,
who knows what you'll get.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.098
Sea gives up all kinds
of secrets.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.715
- You think we're gonna
be able to ID. the remains?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.466
- Hope so.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.969
There were at least five men
on board when she went down.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.141
- At least five?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.729
- Well, James Garrick
and Andy Weaver,

03:11.858 --> 03:14.565
the boat's owners, they
vanished after she was lost.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.481
Presumed dead,
but nobody knows for sure

03:16.613 --> 03:17.773
if they were on board or not.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.521
- Sounds suspicious.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.068
- Yeah...

03:21.201 --> 03:22.737
James was a drinker.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.279
I mean, sober for years,
as far as I knew,

03:24.413 --> 03:26.529
but a lot of people
blamed him afterwards,

03:26.665 --> 03:28.451
especially Andy's wife, Vera.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.245
- Vera.
Okay.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.619
Let's go find out
if they were right.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.641
- Hank?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.054
- Vera.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.098
Vera, you don't want
to see none of this.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.892
- Why not?

03:53.024 --> 03:54.104
Is that my Andy?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.770
It is, isn't it?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.860
Damn that James Garrick.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.990
- This belongs with you,
not in no evidence locker.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.080
- Andy won't rest easy
without it.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.585
- You go home.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.127
Let the police do
what they got to do.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.348
- Brooke?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.014
Hey.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.761
I picked up a shift.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.854
I need you to watch Michael,
all right?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.814
- What?
No, I'm seeing Jake tonight.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.479
- I know, honey.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.274
- No, that's not fair.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.691
- Okay.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.109
You've had to take on
so much

04:44.242 --> 04:49.032
with the house
and your brother.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.200
Baby, I know it's not fair,
none of it,

04:51.333 --> 04:52.743
but I need you.

04:52.876 --> 04:53.956
I need your help.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.996
- [sighs]
Yeah, I know.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.244
- Okay.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.665
There's dinner
in the microwave

04:58.799 --> 04:59.663
to heat up for Michael.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.165
Make sure he does
his homework.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.041
Uh, where are my keys?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.793
- Don't look at me.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.045
- Michael?

05:06.181 --> 05:07.170
- Yeah?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.638
- Did you see my keys?

05:08.767 --> 05:09.882
- I didn't touch them.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.554
-Cmp

05:11.686 --> 05:13.677
Can you help me look, honey,
please?

05:15.941 --> 05:18.853
Oh, got 'em.
Got 'em.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.648
Brooke, babe,
don't hurt yourself.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.863
[knock on door]

05:24.991 --> 05:26.071
Just a minute!

05:26.201 --> 05:29.364
[knocking]

05:29.496 --> 05:32.363
All right!
All right!

05:32.499 --> 05:35.411
- This was Andy's.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.412
- Hank worked for James
and Andy building boats,

05:39.548 --> 05:40.958
including this one.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.206
- Great.
So you found the wreck?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.422
- Yeah.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.543
- Is there anything here
that looks like

05:45.679 --> 05:47.044
it may have caused it?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.341
- Isn't always a reason.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.556
Sea takes what she wants.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.391
- Well, that may be, Hank,

05:53.520 --> 05:56.512
but we need to know
how it happened.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.265
Should this be all corroded
like this?

06:00.402 --> 06:01.562
- A year in these waters,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.231
anything metal's gonna
look like that.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.445
That don't tell you nothing.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.189
- So you're saying we're not
gonna find any answers?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.863
- I think you won't like
the ones you find.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.361
- Andy came back,
did he?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.408
He explain himself, Vera?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.953
- He never ran off like you
always thought, Tracy.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.747
But that storm washed
up the Honor up shore.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.916
- The boat washed in?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.379
- Yeah, what's left of her.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.466
And what's left of my husband,
Andy, was belowdecks.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.257
This was in his bones.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.425
- Andy wasn't supposed
to be on the boat that day.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.594
- Well, maybe that husband
of yours needed some help.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.934
Maybe he was too damn drunk
to pilot her in himself.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.097
- That's a lie, Vera.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.766
You know James was done
with the drinking.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.763
- So you say.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.889
- Why'd you come here, Vera?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.311
You want to hear me say,
"I'm sorry,"

06:42.444 --> 06:44.480
because I thought Andy was
to blame and ran off in shame?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.103
James is dead too, you know?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.479
- Yeah, well, that's a justice.

06:47.616 --> 06:52.235
- Well, they found Andy
on the boat, not James.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.234
Get out!

06:53.371 --> 06:56.078
Get out of my house!

06:56.207 --> 06:59.620
[glass shattering]

06:59.753 --> 07:01.084
[screams]

07:04.299 --> 07:07.166
[dramatic music]

07:07.302 --> 07:15.300
J‘J‘

07:38.458 --> 07:41.165
- Is this James?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.159
Why does Vera blame James
for Andy's death?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.911
- Because Dad got him killed.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.083
- Brooke.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.331
- Dad didn't get anyone killed.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.378
- He killed his whole crew.
- Take it back.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.546
- No.
- Take it back.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.589
- Hey, hey, hey,
you two!

07:51.721 --> 07:53.757
You two, to your rooms now.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.428
Now!

07:57.560 --> 08:00.017
Brooke blames her dad,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.432
and Michael blames anybody
but James.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.692
And I blamed Andy.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.900
I thought he'd run off, guilty,
you know?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.360
I even said so in public.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.400
But Andy didn't
get away either.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.398
Vera's got a right
to be mad at me.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.571
- Has anything like this ever
happened here before?

08:15.704 --> 08:18.446
- Well, not that I know of,
but I don't care.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.037
I'm done.
We're leaving.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.667
- Tracy, you finally
have a chance

08:21.793 --> 08:22.873
to find the cause
of the wreck.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.334
- Is that gonna change anything?

08:24.462 --> 08:26.623
The way people treat me?
The way they treat my kids?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.998
- Your children have been
through an awful lot.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.251
This home is the last stable
thing that they have.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.719
So why don't you let us
look into this

08:34.848 --> 08:36.884
before you give up on that?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.928
- Tracy, some of the parts
we found

08:39.060 --> 08:42.223
look unusually corroded to me.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.767
Do you have any idea where
James sourced his materials?

08:44.899 --> 08:48.733
- Oh, it's a global business
these days.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.147
Ask your Little League buddy.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.235
He arranged a lot of it.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.774
- Duke?

08:52.907 --> 08:56.365
- You and Duke
were in Little League?

08:56.494 --> 09:00.578
- Yeah, James was our coach
one year when he was 16.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.698
He was good to me.
[chuckles]

09:02.834 --> 09:04.916
Even though I had
a lousy throwing arm.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.286
- "Had"?
Yeah, I've seen you throw.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.585
- Funny.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.253
You know, I don't even know
how he made time.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.842
He was holding down three jobs
in high school.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.589
Got sent home once
for a month for exhaustion.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.761
- Did you know Tracy, too,
growing up?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.475
- No, she moved here later.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.346
If you're gonna ask if her
family's had troubles,

09:25.482 --> 09:26.767
I don't know.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.267
- Something freaky clearly
was going on in there,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.109
'cause those kids looked scared.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.489
- Hmm.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.775
- What?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.024
- Andy's body just washed up.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.650
- [chuckles]

09:38.787 --> 09:40.277
Oh, so now
you're going ghost on me?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.369
- You were the one
talking about dead pirates.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.912
- Well, I mean, around here,
you never know.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.247
[sighs]

09:54.886 --> 09:56.922
We got to do some digging.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.390
- Just set up the meeting,
Karl.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.476
- I don't know, man.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.228
I don't want to get mixed up
in this.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.323
- All right, look, you—

10:29.003 --> 10:29.913
Hey!

10:30.046 --> 10:31.957
You're late!

10:32.090 --> 10:34.172
When I tell you to be somewhere,
you be there!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.461
- Who's this?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.710
- Hey, Kar—Karl,
don't worry about who he is.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.929
He's with me.
He's fine.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.343
Look...

10:43.476 --> 10:45.341
I want a meeting with Stoney.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.390
- The people that you stole
from, Duke—

10:48.523 --> 10:50.684
- Hey.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.524
- The people
that you stole from,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.814
you know they're gonna kill you,
all right?

10:55.947 --> 10:57.027
A meeting's not gonna help.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.738
- [scoffs]

10:58.867 --> 11:02.200
[clears throat]

11:02.328 --> 11:06.867
Will you or will you not
set it up?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.332
- Duke, l—

11:13.840 --> 11:17.082
- I'll pay you double
the cash I gave you.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.379
- Fine.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.597
Fine.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.433
But. ..[stammers]

11:27.562 --> 11:31.851
It's your funeral.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.974
- Charity work.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.155
- You have to polish
each one of those?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.577
Remind me to tip better.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.416
- Everything that gets washed
gets polished.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.501
Duke hates spots.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.088
- What happened
at your house today,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.128
I don't know
what caused it exactly.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.592
But I think it might
have something to do

12:01.721 --> 12:04.212
with the troubles.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.589
- Troubles.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.511
You don't believe
it was Andy's ghost?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.350
- I don't know
what I believe yet,

12:09.479 --> 12:12.937
but if we're dealing
with a haunting—

12:13.066 --> 12:14.772
I've been searching
for hints

12:14.901 --> 12:16.687
if there was anything
that happened at your house

12:16.819 --> 12:18.195
or with your family.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.437
- Hey, leave my family
out of it.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.529
- You know these things
run in families.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.614
- Not in mine.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.074
- And they keep these things
secret,

12:25.203 --> 12:29.492
even from each other.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.535
- Secret?

12:31.668 --> 12:35.126
People talk dirt about my family
night and day in this town.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.292
I walk in that dining room
and people stop talking

12:38.424 --> 12:41.006
or—or they look at me sideways
and smile.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.545
You want to know
my family's secrets?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.590
Ask them!

12:54.857 --> 12:56.017
- Hey, buddy.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.436
- He's not even supposed
to be here.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.025
We're gonna get in trouble.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.530
- Only if you tell Mom.

13:01.656 --> 13:05.569
And if you do,
you're dead.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.784
I'm so sick of this, Jake.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.823
I mean, now that they've
found the boat again,

13:09.956 --> 13:11.162
it's all gonna start.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.872
I mean,
you're the only one

13:13.001 --> 13:14.332
that even talks
to me anymore.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.702
- That's 'cause
I love you, babe.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.878
- [scoffs]
Stop.

13:22.010 --> 13:22.999
Jake, stop.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.172
Michael can see.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.260
- So?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.504
Let him learn.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.221
- Jake, stop.
- Come on.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.215
- Jake, don't.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.343
Jake, stop.
Jake, stop.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.685
- Hey!

13:34.814 --> 13:37.180
- Jake, get off!

13:47.618 --> 13:49.529
- Michael shouldn't have
called you.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.039
- Brooke's boyfriend got hurt
and she took off.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.281
I think it's a good thing
that he did.

13:54.417 --> 13:58.035
- Oh, I'm just
so tired of everything.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.709
I just want to take
my kids and go.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.877
- All right, well,
first things first.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.877
- Thing is...

14:07.013 --> 14:08.844
I don't know what
I can tell you.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.009
- What do you know
about poltergeists?

14:11.142 --> 14:13.633
- Like that movie?
- Sort of.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.352
They're associated
with emotional turbulence.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.688
Often a child.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.853
Objects will move around.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.853
- Do you think...

14:24.989 --> 14:26.695
Brooke?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.985
- She was there both times.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.528
- Yeah.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.913
Uh, she was upset
when l was going to work

14:33.039 --> 14:38.329
and then Vera came and...

14:38.461 --> 14:40.543
Do you know how
we can stop it?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.582
- Well, we need
to find her first,

14:42.715 --> 14:46.424
so can you think of any place
special that she might go?

14:46.552 --> 14:49.919
- James Garrick's boat washed up
on the beach this morning.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.798
I think shoddy materials
took her down.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.721
- [sighs]

14:55.853 --> 14:57.809
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.180
- Sorry because you sold him
the parts?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.932
- Because it's a tragedy,
Nathan.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.606
I sold him non-essential parts.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.944
James was a friend.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.438
- Were you friends?

15:08.574 --> 15:11.281
Where'd he get the bad parts?

15:11.411 --> 15:14.744
- Oh, I see.

15:14.872 --> 15:19.036
You know, Nathan, I can help you
answer that question.

15:19.168 --> 15:23.161
In fact, I'd enjoy helping you
answer that question.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.584
But I can't do that
if I'm dead.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.086
So quiet as it's kept,

15:32.223 --> 15:34.680
I need your help first.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.174
- Ahh.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.220
So you get caught stealing

15:37.353 --> 15:39.435
and you want me
to bail you out?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.304
- I didn't steal anything.
- No?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.272
They just want to kill you
for no reason?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.312
- They think they have a reason,
but they're wrong.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.936
- Five minutes with you and
the Pope would find a reason.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.573
- I told you, okay?

15:49.699 --> 15:52.156
I didn't steal anything.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.276
[sighs]

15:58.082 --> 16:00.289
I was hired
to deliver a box

16:00.418 --> 16:02.283
as specified, unopened.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.706
The recipients claim
it was empty

16:04.839 --> 16:06.795
and that I stole its contents.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.039
- Are they lying?

16:08.176 --> 16:12.169
- I think Stoney—
the bottom-feeder who hired me—

16:12.305 --> 16:14.762
set me up,
took the item,

16:14.891 --> 16:16.847
gave me an empty box
to deliver,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.092
and then paid me
with this.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.022
- It's counterfeit.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.520
- Yeah.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.272
- It's good.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.650
It's really good,
but...

16:35.786 --> 16:38.914
what's your plan?

16:39.040 --> 16:43.079
- Well, the plan is evolving
with the situation.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.503
- Did Michael
tell you I was here?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.878
- He said you used
to come here with your father.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.927
- Yeah, that turned out
to be a waste of time.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.893
- You still have a family.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.807
- My family?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.976
They're even more
messed up than I am.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.848
- Hey, I get that
you're angry.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.476
I saw what happened
at the house.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.025
- What?
You think I did that?

17:13.157 --> 17:14.863
- No, l—

17:14.992 --> 17:16.243
I think that you were—

17:16.369 --> 17:17.950
- Acting out?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.161
Please.
I'm not a kid.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.325
- I didn't say
that you were a kid.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.995
- No, but you're thinking that I
shouldn't be angry, aren't you?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.287
- No.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.796
- Well, why shouldn't I?

17:27.922 --> 17:29.753
He wrecked my entire life.

17:29.882 --> 17:30.997
- Okay, listen.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.543
I'm just trying to understand,
Brooke.

17:32.677 --> 17:36.545
I want—l want to help you,
all right?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.387
Have you heard of the troubles?

17:38.516 --> 17:41.053
- You think I'm one
of those freaks?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.597
- No, I think that they're
people just like you,

17:43.729 --> 17:45.310
and I think that maybe
you don't even know

17:45.439 --> 17:46.895
what you're capable of.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.276
- You think you know me?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.233
You don't know me!

17:51.362 --> 17:55.071
You have no idea what I would
do if I could do that stufﬂ

17:55.199 --> 17:59.192
No idea!

17:59.328 --> 18:00.829
[sobbing]

18:00.955 --> 18:03.116
But I can't!

18:03.249 --> 18:06.833
I'm not one of those freaks.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.418
I'm nobody.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.753
- All right.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.963
Okay.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.081
It's okay.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.255
I know.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.095
It's okay.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.306
- It's perfect, right?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.727
- Thanks.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.566
- We work together,

18:32.695 --> 18:33.559
I get to screw Stoney,

18:33.696 --> 18:35.027
and you get to bust
a counterfeiter.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.364
- So your plan is to use me?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.483
- Oh, come on, Nathan.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.827
We both come out ahead here.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.820
And as an added cherry
on top,

18:44.957 --> 18:47.198
I live long enough to help you
with James's boat.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.873
- If you're telling me
the truth.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.996
- It's the truth.
Trust me.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.793
- Do you remember third grade?

18:54.925 --> 18:57.837
- I remember that you really
liked the Pet Shop Boys.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.177
- Spring.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.093
You waited inside for me
with a bunch of your friends

19:03.225 --> 19:04.476
after gym class.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.935
You're all smiling,
congratulating me.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.770
- Do we have to do this
right now?

19:09.899 --> 19:10.888
- Yep.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.390
- Okay.
Okay.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.017
l-l-l told you

19:15.154 --> 19:16.815
that Carla Rose
had a crush on you.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.029
- I felt like
I won the lottery.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.864
- Nathan,
that was 25 years ago.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.654
- You all slapped me
on the back.

19:22.787 --> 19:23.867
Remember that?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.372
"Go talk to her.
Talk to her."

19:25.498 --> 19:27.204
I walked down the hall
and I got up to her

19:27.333 --> 19:29.790
and I felt like my heart
was beating out of my chest.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.534
I finally open
my mouth enough

19:31.671 --> 19:34.458
to actually tell her
that I liked her too.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.046
- She screamed.

19:36.175 --> 19:41.715
- Screamed because there was
blood dripping down my back.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.587
From?

19:43.724 --> 19:46.010
- The tacks
that we stuck in it.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.180
- When you were
"congratulating" me.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.304
You had a pool going
on how many you guys

19:51.440 --> 19:53.396
could stick in my back
before I noticed.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.062
-16.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.186
-16?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.186
Hmm.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.312
- Nathan, if it wasn't for me,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.405
you never would have
even talked to her.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.570
- I didn't talk
to another girl

20:03.703 --> 20:04.567
for two years after that.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.069
- I was eight years old.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.070
- Uh, so was I.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.413
- And so what?

20:09.542 --> 20:10.873
- So what?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.957
- You think I should die
for that?

20:13.087 --> 20:15.544
- Well...

20:22.888 --> 20:24.139
crash!

20:24.265 --> 20:26.176
[automobile speeding away]

20:26.308 --> 20:27.923
- Mom, what's going on?

20:28.060 --> 20:32.053
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, cowards!

20:40.197 --> 20:43.485
Michael?

20:47.037 --> 20:49.414
Michael?

20:51.959 --> 20:52.823
Michael?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.121
Michael, no!

20:55.254 --> 20:59.623
No.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.968
Oh, it's okay.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.654
- So you get a lot
of natural light here

21:23.783 --> 21:25.865
with the windows.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.109
Main living space here.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.112
And—hi.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.534
Let me show you the bedrooms
down this way.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.331
- Hey, stay out.
It's private.

21:41.467 --> 21:45.176
- Oh, not if you want
to sell it, son.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.669
- Maybe they don't
want to after all.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.717
- Uh, I'm sorry.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.510
This is my
late husband's office.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.634
We've kept it exactly
as it is.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.352
Michael's a little bit
sensitive about that.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.516
- Fine.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.105
Uh, let's go.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.065
- Oh, well, you're welcome
to look anywhere else.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.526
- No, thanks.
We've seen enough.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.990
- Wow, Nathan.
You look like crap.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.504
- Huh.
- Did you sleep in your truck?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.495
- Give me the bag.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.623
- You got this?
- I got this.

22:23.759 --> 22:28.048
- Give me the gun.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.387
And the badge.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.052
- [sighs]

22:32.184 --> 22:34.391
- Good.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.308
Eh.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.646
You still look like a cop.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.891
Can you look more disheveled,
you know?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.892
Like, maybe mess up your hair
or something?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.439
- What?
- Yeah, mess—you know?

22:45.573 --> 22:46.528
Just
- Hey.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.022
- Okay.
You know what?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.490
Just, uh,
stick to the plan

22:50.619 --> 22:52.735
and I'm sure
it'll all be fine.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.534
- Yeah, makes me feel
a lot better.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.658
- Good.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.247
- [sighs]

23:14.101 --> 23:16.183
- Michael had some kind
of seizure last night

23:16.312 --> 23:17.768
after you called.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.762
- His father was troubled,
wasn't he?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.605
- James had them too
when he was a boy.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.599
Almost killed him.
- What was this?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.272
Was this around 1983?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.395
- His parents were desperate.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.113
There was a woman
who helped them.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.778
- A woman?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.026
- Mm-hmm.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.743
- Was—

23:34.872 --> 23:35.736
was her name Lucy?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.454
Was it Lucy Ripley?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.699
- He said "Lucy."
Yeah.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.166
Do you know her?

23:41.295 --> 23:42.535
- [chuckles]

23:42.671 --> 23:46.710
l—l think she might
be my mother.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.128
So she helped him?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.126
- He said that
she helped him

23:51.263 --> 23:56.553
hold himself together
till his problem passed.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.471
Then I saw Michael last night.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.266
I had no idea he meant
that literally.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.481
Can you help him?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.566
Will you?

24:06.695 --> 24:09.152
- I can try.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.945
Seems to be
in the family business.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.255
- So you must be Sheldon.

24:36.392 --> 24:40.681
- l am...Sheldon.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.349
You're Stoney?

24:42.481 --> 24:43.982
- Not what you pictured?

24:44.108 --> 24:45.973
- No.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.193
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.653
So you're here to buy Duke
another life?

24:51.782 --> 24:53.693
- You make that sound
like a bad idea.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.781
- Well, I have a better one.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.241
- Like what?

24:56.370 --> 24:58.201
- Like we split
what's in the bag,

24:58.330 --> 25:01.413
Duke dies,
and we're all better off.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.749
- You have no idea
how tempting that sounds.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.083
- Good.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.874
Let's do that and then
you can buy me a drink.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.872
- I accept.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.671
We'll split the cash.
Duke dies.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.543
- Still buying me a drink?

25:14.680 --> 25:18.298
- Absolutely.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.232
Something wrong?

25:32.364 --> 25:35.231
- Those bills are fake,
Sheldon.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.198
You don't think I'd recognize
my own work?

25:37.327 --> 25:38.783
- Well, it was, you know—

25:38.912 --> 25:41.528
it was worth a try.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.075
Okay, come on.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.994
Okay.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.242
- Nobody move!

25:46.378 --> 25:47.584
You're all under arrest.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.830
Special agent, Haven PD.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.049
Get down.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.511
How you doing, Stoney?

25:57.639 --> 25:59.379
- He's not a real cop.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.758
- But I am.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.272
Let's go.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.517
Oh, give me the badge.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.938
- Oh.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.905
- You know, Haven PD doesn't
have special agents.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.398
- Oh, come on now.

26:17.534 --> 26:21.777
You can't tell me
that wasn't special.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.996
- My dad told me
it might happen.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.534
It's like a sickness
or something

26:25.667 --> 26:29.410
people in our family get.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.923
- What did he tell you?

26:32.049 --> 26:35.462
- Just that it's like being
out of control...

26:35.594 --> 26:37.004
of everything.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.549
Like, your body's moving in
a thousand directions at once.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.467
- Is that what it felt like?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.261
- Like, my mom holding
on to me

26:43.393 --> 26:48.228
was the only thing
that kept me here.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.392
- All right.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.935
And have you ever
felt like that before

26:51.068 --> 26:53.229
with Vera or with Jake or—

26:53.362 --> 26:55.148
- No.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.486
- Don't worry, Michael.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.025
You know, you can tell me.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.443
- I didn't.

26:59.576 --> 27:05.116
I didn't push Mrs. Weaver.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.240
I didn't do that.
- Listen, Michael.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.831
You're ju—

27:14.967 --> 27:16.377
Hey, Michael,
do me a favor.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.795
Can you go find your mom?

27:17.928 --> 27:19.839
I need a few minutes.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.338
- Just don't mess
with anything, okay?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.465
- Yeah.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.899
You're here, aren't you?

27:38.031 --> 27:40.283
You're just trying
to protect your family.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.516
- [shudders]

28:18.280 --> 28:20.191
You haven't changed, Lucy.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.780
- No. Lucy—
Lucy was my mother.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.649
Can you tell me about her?

28:23.785 --> 28:25.366
- Please, I don't know
how long I can hold on.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.237
Just tell my wife
that I'm here.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.238
I've been trying to let her know
for months,

28:30.375 --> 28:32.707
but it's so hard
to touch anything.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.996
When I do—

28:34.129 --> 28:36.336
- You're not dead.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.921
- Not sure there's
any difference.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.166
- You're just moving so fast.
You're vibrating.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.508
You're sped up.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.843
That's why we can't see you.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.051
So everything that you touch—

28:44.181 --> 28:45.762
- They accelerate.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.258
Fly off if I don't go
right through them.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.258
It's—

28:50.395 --> 28:51.771
- Whoa.
- It's get—

28:51.897 --> 28:52.932
it's getting—

28:53.065 --> 28:54.054
it's getting hard.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.146
It's taking more out of me.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.890
- And what about Vera and Jake?

28:57.027 --> 28:58.688
- I never meant to hurt them.
|_

28:58.820 --> 29:00.435
- Okay.
It's okay.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.607
It's all right.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.105
You were just protecting
your family.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.278
- No.
No, nothing is okay.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.617
- Come on.
Come on, James.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.407
Hold on.
Come on! Come on.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.949
Don't let go.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.618
- Now tell me about the boat.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.335
- Okay.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.965
Have you talked
to any of James's men?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.956
- Yeah, Hank Olson
was poking around the wreck.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.958
- Covering his ass.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.507
You're looking for
Sal and Nancy Fortuna.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.095
East Haven Metalworks.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.964
- Do you know 'em?

29:29.101 --> 29:30.682
- Hank was pushing
James and Andy

29:30.811 --> 29:32.517
to throw work at them.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.307
The Fortunas cut
a lot of corners.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.020
You understand?

29:36.149 --> 29:38.481
This won't be the only wreck
you can tie to them.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.727
- Why would James
and Andy trust them?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.728
- They trusted Hank.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.993
I'm sure he was getting a cut
for steering business their way.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.405
- Well, if he knew
what they were doing,

29:49.538 --> 29:52.245
he'll get a cut
of the prison time too.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.410
- Nathan?

29:54.543 --> 29:58.286
I'm sorry about the tacks.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.469
- Okay, so how did you
survive the wreck?

30:12.602 --> 30:14.809
- l never—l was never
on the boat.

30:14.938 --> 30:15.848
- What?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.472
- Michael's project.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.940
He got into places
that we'd finished

30:21.069 --> 30:22.479
and moved on from.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.854
Took photos of parts
that I never should have

30:25.991 --> 30:28.198
had to worry about for years
that were already

30:28.327 --> 30:31.694
showing signs of stress,
warping, deforming.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.866
I'd been cheated.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.535
- Bad parts?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.783
- I was furious.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.707
The boat was due to go out
the day I discovered it.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.626
- You had a seizure.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.250
- I knew I had to warn—

30:46.386 --> 30:49.219
I shouted.
Nobody heard.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.929
And I knew he was gonna—

30:51.058 --> 30:54.141
he was gonna take her out
if I hadn't shown.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.634
I couldn't stop him.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.229
- So you've—
you've been here...

30:59.358 --> 31:02.191
surrounded by your family,
not able to talk to them

31:02.319 --> 31:03.183
or touch them.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.561
- I've tried.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.690
The first night,
Tracy was in the bed,

31:09.826 --> 31:11.691
looking at our photos
from our honeymoon trip

31:11.828 --> 31:15.116
to Nova Scotia and...

31:15.248 --> 31:17.705
she was crying.

31:26.051 --> 31:30.010
- What are you doing?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.254
-Uh...

31:32.391 --> 31:34.177
Tracy, can I—

31:34.309 --> 31:36.766
can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.102
- Guys, stay here.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.696
What is going on
in this house?

31:50.826 --> 31:53.283
- All right,
this is gonna sound strange.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.779
- It's about Michael.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.121
- No, it's about James.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.333
- James?
- He's alive...

32:01.461 --> 32:02.962
and he's here in the house.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.168
- What?

32:04.297 --> 32:05.958
- He's been trying
to communicate with you.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.003
- Is this fun for you?

32:09.136 --> 32:10.546
James is dead.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.169
- The night he vanished,
you were looking

32:12.305 --> 32:15.843
at pictures
of your honeymoon...

32:15.976 --> 32:17.466
that you took to Nova Scotia...

32:17.602 --> 32:19.809
and you were crying
on the bed

32:19.938 --> 32:22.475
and he wanted
to reach out to you.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.767
- That's not possible.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.313
- He had a seizure
and it changed him,

32:27.446 --> 32:30.483
but he is still here.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.826
- You...saw him?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.412
- I touched him.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.003
- Can I?

32:47.132 --> 32:48.338
- I think so.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.707
[cell phone rings]

32:49.843 --> 32:50.923
- [sighs]

32:51.052 --> 32:53.213
- I'm sorry.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.301
This is my partner.

32:54.431 --> 32:57.764
I have to take this.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.133
Nathan?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.009
- Hank Olson
was a part of this.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.511
- Wait.
Part of what?

33:02.647 --> 33:04.729
- Well, Hank hooked James up
with an outfit

33:04.858 --> 33:06.723
called East Haven Metalworks.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.316
Sal and Nancy Fortuna.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.312
Duke thinks they're responsible
for any number of wrecks.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.530
- Well, if Hank's in on this,
he'll have warned them.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.364
- And they'll be desperate
to destroy anything

33:15.494 --> 33:16.609
that links 'em.

33:16.745 --> 33:17.951
I'm sending units after Hank.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.990
I'll meet you at the boatyard
in 30 minutes.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.363
- Hey, I'll do you one better.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.286
James had a home office

33:23.418 --> 33:25.875
and I'll just start there.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.290
James, I know you
kept everything,

33:28.423 --> 33:32.666
but did you have
to keep everything?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.760
This is impossible.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.302
[thud and glass shatters]

33:39.434 --> 33:41.425
[footsteps approaching]

34:08.463 --> 34:11.125
You must be the Fortunas.

34:15.095 --> 34:16.585
- Look, nobody wants
anything bad

34:16.721 --> 34:17.585
to happen to anybody.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.802
- Should have thought
of that

34:18.932 --> 34:20.638
before you cut corners
on the metalwork.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.099
- I'll remember that
for next time.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.264
- You...
you said you took pictures.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.603
Where are they?

34:26.731 --> 34:29.222
Show me.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.897
- What's going on?
Is he epileptic?

34:37.033 --> 34:38.614
- That's not epilepsy.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.985
- [groans]

34:42.122 --> 34:43.487
- Hey, Michael.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.453
Ah!

34:50.589 --> 34:56.129
- Come on.
Give me the gun.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.627
- Come on.
Come on.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.754
- Michael?

35:02.475 --> 35:04.466
- What the hell was that?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.935
- Please.
I have to get him to a doctor.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.179
- Just let them go,
all right?

35:09.316 --> 35:13.150
You can—
you can keep me.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.519
What are you gonna do?
Shoot four people?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.156
What's that really solve, huh?

35:17.282 --> 35:18.692
- There's no way but forward.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.860
- What do you mean?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.199
- Place could burn down.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.319
- Think a gas leak?

35:23.455 --> 35:24.661
- Sure.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.121
It would take care of all those
papers and the witnesses.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.831
- Hank must have really
scared you

35:28.960 --> 35:30.200
to get you
to come down here so fast.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.373
What is he gonna do,
have you cover up his mess?

35:32.505 --> 35:33.665
- Just stay where you are.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.629
- Did you cover up
your other wrecks like this?

35:35.759 --> 35:37.169
'Cause you're not doing
a very good job

35:37.302 --> 35:38.712
of staying on top of this one.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.051
- Don't worry.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.887
Honey, fire always
does the trick.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.598
- Ah!

35:49.814 --> 35:52.226
- James!

35:56.655 --> 35:57.861
- We got Hank in custody.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.695
- Yeah, all right, Nathan.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.155
Yeah, they're bringing them
in now.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.660
Okay, uh-huh.

36:02.786 --> 36:05.528
I'll meet you there,
yeah.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.747
Okay, so both of their shoulders
are shattered

36:08.875 --> 36:10.581
and they're gonna be
a spending a lot of time

36:10.710 --> 36:12.041
in the prison hospital.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.582
- I don't really care
about them.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.877
Can you...

36:18.009 --> 36:22.673
get him?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.421
- I can try.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.929
- James.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.764
- I'm so sorry, baby.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.145
- All that matters now
is that you're back.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.102
- I'm not back.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.644
You'll never know
what it took to come this time,

37:16.776 --> 37:19.609
but it took everything I have.

37:19.738 --> 37:23.481
- So tomorrow...
you'll recover.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.575
- No.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.741
When I'm gone this time...

37:30.874 --> 37:34.617
there's no coming back.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.962
I'm all used up, baby.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.331
I love you so much, Tracy.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.675
I always will.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.668
All of you.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.966
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.806
- You can't go.
You can't go.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.803
- Michael, no,
I'm not going anywhere.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.601
You see—you see
that bell over there?

37:57.734 --> 37:59.690
Hmm?

37:59.819 --> 38:01.810
Now, that was from
my first ship.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.313
And when that starts ringing,

38:05.450 --> 38:08.658
that'll be me.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.994
I'll always be here with you,

38:11.122 --> 38:15.661
even though you won't be able
to see me.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.000
Thank you.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.086
That's the second time
you've brought me back.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.001
All those years ago—

38:22.133 --> 38:23.839
- No, that was—
that was my mother,

38:23.968 --> 38:28.007
but I'm sure
she was glad to help.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.175
- I did my best
to make her regret it.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.343
- Hmm?

38:31.476 --> 38:35.094
- When I had my seizure,
I shattered a glass,

38:35.230 --> 38:38.848
and it cut her
deep on the sole of her foot,

38:38.983 --> 38:40.848
but she kept holding.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.852
Holding on anyhow
till I was safe.

38:43.988 --> 38:48.482
I always hoped that
I'd get to say thanks.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.079
It's happening.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.324
Good-bye.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.123
- [sobbing]

39:22.485 --> 39:25.397
- One, two.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.895
One, two, three.
- Okay, come on.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.567
Are you really gonna
burn all that

39:28.700 --> 39:30.361
perfectly good fake money
that you just won?

39:30.493 --> 39:33.235
- Yeah.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.362
- You did good back there,
Nathan.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.614
I mean it.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.126
Kept your cool.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.459
You know...
[clears throat]

39:41.588 --> 39:44.204
There is a world
of opportunity out there

39:44.340 --> 39:46.956
if you just got over
this whole law and order fetish.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.550
- You couldn't take
the competition.

39:49.679 --> 39:55.049
- [laughs]

39:55.184 --> 39:56.264
- Ante up.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.976
50 grand.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.390
- Admit it.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.764
I saved your ass.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.769
- Mm, technically,
you arrested my ass.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.896
- Yeah.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.899
Technically, I did.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.991
Huh.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.156
Funny old world.

40:16.289 --> 40:19.622
[acoustic rock]

40:19.751 --> 40:23.915
- J‘ What is it
keeps me returning J‘

40:24.047 --> 40:28.882
J‘ to questions I ask? J‘

40:29.010 --> 40:33.344
J‘ My paper heart
has been burning J‘

40:33.473 --> 40:35.464
- Hey.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.215
- Hey.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.468
- So I talked to Vince and Dave
down at The Herald

40:39.604 --> 40:41.265
and they're gonna make sure
that the town

40:41.397 --> 40:43.353
knows the truth
about what happened.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.439
I think it's gonna make it
a lot easier

40:45.568 --> 40:46.978
for your family to stay.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.944
I'm glad you're able
to keep your home.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.188
- Hmm.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.189
Last couple of days
couldn't make me leave.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.486
Forget about it.

40:54.619 --> 40:55.825
- Yeah.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.195
- Audrey,
I need to ask you something.

40:58.331 --> 40:59.821
- Sure.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.166
- I've been there
in my house

41:03.294 --> 41:07.958
with James for a year.

41:08.091 --> 41:11.834
But I never touched him,

41:11.970 --> 41:15.428
never felt him.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.968
How come you can?

41:22.271 --> 41:24.353
- I don't know.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.528
- You know, if this
is your family business,

41:32.657 --> 41:36.650
you're doing pretty good.

41:36.786 --> 41:39.152
I think Lucy would be proud.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.870
- I should go.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.119
[chuckling]
- See you around.

41:47.255 --> 41:55.253
J‘J‘

41:58.391 --> 42:02.225
[indistinct chatter]

42:02.353 --> 42:03.559
- You think I'm bluffing
the call?

42:03.688 --> 42:05.644
- All righty.
Here we go.

42:05.773 --> 42:10.392
- J‘ I never was someone
who knew what to say J‘

42:10.528 --> 42:15.192
J‘ I sank to the bottom
while you rode the waves J‘

42:15.324 --> 42:17.736
J‘ Why couldn't you teach me? J‘

42:17.869 --> 42:24.616
J‘ If only you knew
how I longed for those words, J‘

42:24.751 --> 42:29.541
J‘ how I longed for those words J‘

42:31.716 --> 42:39.714
J‘J‘

42:49.567 --> 42:51.432
J‘ I don't wanna
take something J‘

42:51.569 --> 42:54.106
J‘ that never was mine J‘

42:54.238 --> 42:58.948
J‘ or fill in blank spaces
with more dotted lines J‘

42:59.077 --> 43:03.787
J‘ One thing I can promise
when all the smoke clears J‘

43:03.915 --> 43:06.531
J‘ Just look in this window J‘

43:06.667 --> 43:10.580
J‘ You'll find me here J‘
