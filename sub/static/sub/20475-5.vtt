Uh, I'm not on your team, Coach.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.175
[man] Despite the divisive hashtags

00:50.259 --> 00:52.052
that would have you believe otherwise,

00:52.135 --> 00:54.555
our great nation is built

00:54.638 --> 00:57.849

00:57.933 --> 00:59.935
"All men are created equal."

01:00.561 --> 01:02.187
[Sam] Equal?

01:02.271 --> 01:04.606
You could only vote if you owned land

01:04.690 --> 01:06.024
and didn't have a vagina.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.442

01:15.200 --> 01:19.913
[camera shutter clicking]

01:32.676 --> 01:35.053
[narrator] <i>As the outrage</i>

<i>gave way to campus-wide apathy,</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:39.933

Lady McRib. Really?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.637

02:16.720 --> 02:19.306
The entire campus ranked

02:25.646 --> 02:28.940
-[laughing]
-Mm, you mad scientist.

-Open an Etsy shop

Wait.

Well, what's to hate?

-Thank you. Reggie, you're a genius.

All right, y'all,

03:28.542 --> 03:31.503
who do we get this "Woke or Not" app to,
to make it a thing?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.422
The revolution is running on embers.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.882
It's Saturday, Reggie.
The revolution can wait.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.552
I heard the ASU's having a cook-in.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.553
Hard pass.

People have completely forgotten
about this blackface party.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.934
[Joelle] Reggie.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.812
Sometimes being carefree and black
is an act of revolution.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.690
She's right, man.
Saturday's a day of rest.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.817
You ain't Jewish, man.

while the revolution dies?

04:48.663 --> 04:51.374
Sorry. Dereca got me caught up.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.835
-Dereca's a hot mess.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.100
to our little cook-in.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.727
Well, we wanted to have a cookout,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.437
but real grills are banned on campus.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.106
-Like dogs, right?
-Technically, yes.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.526
But after the blackface party,
I was so traumatized.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.236
I mean, racism here?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.695
I still can't believe it.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.239
No one could have seen it coming.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.990
I thought President Obama fixed all that.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.034
I know, so I went
to the campus psychiatrist,

05:26.117 --> 05:28.161
and I told him that I'd kill myself

05:28.245 --> 05:29.871

05:29.955 --> 05:31.456

06:01.736 --> 06:04.614
Africa owes a lot
to Christian missionaries.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.616
-If they hadn't brought Jesus...
-I love the Lord,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.285

-He's in you right now.

-You're Jesus-like.

It's bad. We gotta go right now.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.881
Is she okay?

06:21.965 --> 06:24.217
No, we cannot talk about this right now.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.346
We should leave right now
for this very real emergency.

We'll pray for her, man.
Right now. Give me your hand.

as we take this as your blood...

-Was the mom thing too much?
-No, that was fine.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.365
My mom died when I was very young,
so I knew she was not on the phone.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.075
What a fool that man was.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.369
-Well, good, I guess.
-[laughing]

06:51.453 --> 06:53.246
Hey, y'all wanna go to a tailgating party?

06:53.330 --> 06:55.624
-It's free.
-It's only free 'cause they suck.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.877
We boring you, Reg?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.962
Who goes to the botanical gardens?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.590
It's like a fucking zoo for plants.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.092
Are you cyberstalking Sam
and her new love interest?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.803
Nah, man. I'm just looking
at this horrible audio lag--

07:08.887 --> 07:10.388
-Thane forever, man!
-[gasps]

07:10.472 --> 07:11.932
I could fix this bullshit in ten minutes.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.726
[Joelle] Sure, you're definitely upset
exclusively about that

07:14.809 --> 07:16.603
and not about that video of Sam and Gabe.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.229
[Reggie] Shit just popped up.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.731
Couldn't give a fuck what they thinkin'.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.441
So we're all cool with Sam dating

07:21.524 --> 07:23.234
-a Abercrombie model?
-[sighs]

07:23.318 --> 07:25.612
I mean, you two
practically share panties, Jo.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.364
-What's your take?
-[laughs]

07:27.447 --> 07:28.740
I mean, Sam's my girl.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.659
If she likes it, I love it.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.327
You know that shit is weird.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.913
I was surprised at first. I admit.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.375
I mean, I'm not sure I could let
a white man colonize my body,

07:38.458 --> 07:41.586
and I never thought Sam would either.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.713
So do you feel personally betrayed?

07:43.797 --> 07:47.634
No. I mean, it's complicated.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.344
I know the heart wants what it wants,

07:49.427 --> 07:51.680
and we're all one
and all that shit, but...

07:51.763 --> 07:53.056
how many times we've had the narrative

07:53.139 --> 07:54.516
that black men aren't good enough

07:54.599 --> 07:56.518
and that we need a white savior?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.062
I mean, I can't help but feel a little--

07:59.145 --> 08:00.897
Disappointed.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.024
-I didn't say that.
-Didn't have to.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.111
Tell you one thing.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.072
I plan to marry me a dark-skinned sister.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.533
Have the ashiest,
blackest babies possible.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.660
-[laughing]
-Won't catch me in these streets

08:13.743 --> 08:16.329
-with a white V.
-Well, I can say,

08:16.413 --> 08:18.957
having conducted multiple
blind taste tests,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.001
you can't tell a white pussy
from a black one.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.003
Friends, in American popular culture,

08:23.086 --> 08:26.297
many black men seem obsessed
with white girls.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.465
What is this about?

08:27.549 --> 08:28.925
[both] Anal.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.053
-[all] To Thane!
-[cheering]

08:34.347 --> 08:36.433
They forgot "student most likely
to pass out drunk

08:36.516 --> 08:37.892
-in a public fountain."
-[chuckles]

08:39.394 --> 08:40.979
Not feeling the school spirit, Reg?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.981
Nah, not really.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.399
Football is the only time

08:44.482 --> 08:46.818
a black face gets celebrated
on this campus.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.069
Never mind their brain

08:48.153 --> 08:49.779
slowly getting pounded into mush.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.239
Right, my brother.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.159
Furthermore, these burgers come from cows

08:54.242 --> 08:55.452
that were packed in pens

08:55.535 --> 08:58.246
same way we was packed into slave ships.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.040
They want us to eat our ancestors.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.584
No, that's not how Reggie talks.
It's more like...

09:02.667 --> 09:04.169
"Weed is a tool of the government...

09:04.252 --> 09:05.628
-Mm.
-[Joelle] ...to anesthetize

09:05.712 --> 09:07.255
black minds into complacency."

09:07.338 --> 09:09.466
Oh, oh. My name is Reggie,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.217
and 9/11 was a inside job.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.428
-[laughing]
-Fuck y'all, man.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.512
[Reggie] It was.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.555
What's up?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.099
You guys talking shit about everyone?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.435
No, just me.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.896
Damn, 'cause, you know,
present company excluded,

09:22.979 --> 09:24.314
I hate everyone else here.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.733
One, I'm obsessed with you.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.985
Deal with it. Two, who are you?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.945
I'm the girl you guys
are gonna share your weed with.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.907
Ikumi, your new catchall Asian friend.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.158
-All right.
-Okay, girl.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.534
Yes.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.995
-My people.
-[laughing]

09:39.913 --> 09:41.414
[Troy] Hey, nice app, Reggie.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.458
Thanks. Glad you like it.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.960
-What, so I'm not woke?
-[Reggie] So say the people.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.755
Maybe because you betrayed us
for your buddy Kurt.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.090
He's doing his best.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.635
How about you do something productive,
instead of trying to make a Wokémon Go?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.096
-It's actually a solid name.
-We will catch them all.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.806
No, don't try to pun your way out
of this conflict.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.390
-We're upset.
-Feel free

09:59.474 --> 10:01.684
to register your complaints
in the comment section.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.815
-[Al] Excuse us.
-[Rashid laughing]

10:06.898 --> 10:09.442
[Reggie] Clarence Thomas
pumpkin pie eating motherfucker.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.735
-[all laugh]
-[Ikumi] Are we really gonna

10:10.819 --> 10:12.529
stay and watch these losers play?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.905
Can't we go see a movie or something?

10:13.988 --> 10:16.032
[Joelle] Yes, movie or something.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
[exhales sharply]

10:18.201 --> 10:20.745
Man, I am not about this long line life.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.332
Hey, is that Lionel?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.751
Or a really skinny lesbian?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.509
-[Reggie] Excuse me.
-Oh, hey, Lionel.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.511
Thanks for holding a spot for us.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.680
Oh, hey, guys.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.350
I've been waiting here for you,
my friends.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.811
-In fact, I was texting you--
-You can stop talking now.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.396
-No one is listening.
-What you seeing?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.439
<i>Crayons: The Movie.</i>

10:48.523 --> 10:49.524
No, your black ass isn't.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.025
I hear it's delightful.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.319
Ooh, how about <i>Oh, No She Didn't?</i>

10:53.403 --> 10:54.445
That cannot be a real movie.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.742
[groans] How many times did they have

10:59.826 --> 11:02.370
to use "get her off" as a double entendre?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.205
We get it. They worked at a law firm

11:04.289 --> 11:06.499
-and they had sex.
-Those were our choices.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.793
Cheap urban drama or tragedy porn.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.420
Man, we could have watched porn?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.338
And when they do accidentally
give us a quality movie,

11:12.422 --> 11:13.548
they think that gives them a pass

11:13.631 --> 11:14.924
to double down on this shit.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.134
Classic moral license.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.343
Like with Tarantino.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.970
Just because he let Jamie Foxx

11:19.053 --> 11:20.471
kill a bunch of racists in <i>Django,</i>

11:20.555 --> 11:24.142
he thinks he can parade around every
painful historical black stereotype.

11:24.225 --> 11:28.104
And we gave him
a NAACP Image Award for that shit.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.647
Swear to God, he gets off

11:29.731 --> 11:31.274
on putting Sam Jackson in his movies

11:31.357 --> 11:33.067
just so all the white characters
can call him "nigger"

11:33.151 --> 11:34.819
-for three hours.
-Hard R too.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.030
Yeah, must really suck
to only have two movies this month

11:37.113 --> 11:38.448
with people that look like you.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.700
Try having the same two options
since 2000.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.202
All I got is <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>
and <i>Crouching Tiger.</i>

11:43.286 --> 11:45.038
And kind of <i>Kung Fu Panda.</i>

11:45.121 --> 11:46.998
I like you, but fuck you.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.752
You do realize
all we do is complain about things.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.796
It is as though Americans
would have no identity

11:53.880 --> 11:56.174
if not for their near-constant outrage.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.092
I know so much about what you don't like.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.928
What do you all like, eh?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.223
-Breakfast for dinner?
-Waller House has breakfast for dinner.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.182
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.767
Omelets, things like that.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.560
A good scramble, maybe avocado.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.645
-Get it, get it.
-Yeah.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.021
See? We like stuff.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.981
I am going back to Kenya.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.900
-[Al] Rashid.
-[Joelle] Ah, come on, 'Shid.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.443
-You going the wrong way.
-To the left.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.653
-This way?
-[Joelle] Yes.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.947
-Okay.
-[Joelle] He'll be back.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.450
[chattering]

12:22.533 --> 12:23.952
[Al] A little...

12:24.035 --> 12:26.621
a little fruit salad.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.790
[Lionel] Whoever decided
pancakes had to be confined

12:28.873 --> 12:30.208
-to certain hours?
-[Rashid] Whoever it was,

12:30.291 --> 12:31.626
that person is a piece of shit.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.088
Ah, you are rubbing off on me, yo.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.507
Al, just let him be African today.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.842
-Okay?
-Hey, everyone on Yik Yak's

12:39.926 --> 12:41.344
talking about some party tonight.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.388
It says lots of booze
and a great playlist.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.973
How can y'all party

12:45.056 --> 12:47.934
when there's shit like this going on?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.812
"Make Campus Safe Again"? From who?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.480
Y'all know who they're talking about.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.357
We need to wake this campus up.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.984
Yeah, but when you say "we,"

12:56.067 --> 12:58.027
we're not the "we" you're talking about.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.904
What's that supposed to mean?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.990
It means you've been checking
your Snapchat all day.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.700
Look, she's with Gabe.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.993
She said it on the fucking radio.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.786
-Deal with it.
-Who wants bacon?

13:06.869 --> 13:07.787
I do.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.254
Sorry. You just...

13:16.337 --> 13:18.548
seemed so stressed, and I thought

13:18.631 --> 13:21.843
maybe I could make you smile again
the way she does, but...

13:21.926 --> 13:24.512
-that was stupid, so...
-Nah, nah, nah, nah.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.639
You're right. I needed a distraction,

13:26.723 --> 13:30.435
so... thank you for...

13:30.518 --> 13:32.145
dragging me out of my rut.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.655
What do you say we honor Thane
by doing what he did best?

13:43.698 --> 13:44.866
Yep.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.076
Let's get white girl wasted.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.244
[Joelle laughs]

13:55.418 --> 13:58.337
Okay, now, that shit, you can rant about.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.631
[Reggie] Nope. We're here to have fun.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.967
[laughs]

14:04.135 --> 14:06.345
Wow. Wow.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.141
[Reggie] Oh, look.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.019
Turns out there's three lawn jockeys
at this party.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.856
Sorry. Having fun.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.816
So much fun.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.237
Oh, look. Your teeth are showing.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.323
Ha-ha. They're so cute.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.991
-Yeah, I brushed 'em today.
-Good.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.285
-Sam.
-What up, y'all?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.787
Hey, I didn't know you'd be here.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.704
I's here.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.332
-What y'all doing?
-Not much.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.292
Terrible AASU party,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.211
uh... football tailgate,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.129
a Sanaa Lathan movie.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.632
Y'all hate-watched
<i>Oh, No She Didn't</i> without me?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.342
I fought it at first,

14:44.425 --> 14:46.677
but, you know,
Joelle made me stick it out.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.179
She's a good friend.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.389
She really is.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.516
I need drinks.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.104
-[Reggie] We missed you.
-[Sam] You missed me?

14:56.187 --> 14:57.605
-[Reggie] Yes.
-[Sam] I was busy.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.898
-[Gabe clears throat]
-Busy?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.024
Here you go, babe.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.986
-Busy.
-Reggie.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.033
-Oh, uh...
-Mm--

15:09.117 --> 15:11.702
The botanical gardens.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.121
Yeah, that looked fun. [chuckles weakly]

15:13.204 --> 15:15.706
Yeah, I mean, it's...

15:15.790 --> 15:17.208
more like a zoo without the animals.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.627
-Hmm.
-Or the cages.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.630
Or the animals dragging kids away
from their mothers.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.881
Fun. Fun.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.508
So much fun.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.344
Uh... Al, could I get a drink?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.642
-Ah.
-That's, like, number five.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.185
-[grunts]
-[Al] It's not disgusting.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.603
It's hypothetical.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.355
Man, just answer the question.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.024
Fuck, marry, kill. Me, Rashid and Reggie.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.484
You all seem lovely.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.986
-But you'd kill Rashid, right?
-No way.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.113
Everyone knows I am marriage material.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.532
[Reggie] Lionel, don't answer
these motherfuckers.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.908
But you'd marry me, right?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.326
[sighs]

15:52.410 --> 15:54.287
-Yes.
-Ah, come on, nigga.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.289
We could go antiquing in Vermont and shit.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.040
[Reggie] "Antiquing in Vermont and shit."

15:58.124 --> 16:01.502
-Reggie! My man.
-Thank God.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.628
[Reggie] What you need, brother?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.964
[both speaking indistinctly]

16:05.047 --> 16:07.717
Hey! Reggie's with me.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.135
Dude's in my data structures class.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.052
He's smart as shit.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.805
No one's ever been as fucked
as you guys are about to be.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.348
Who we fucking?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.517
I mean, I'm up for it. I'm just asking.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.727
[laughs]

16:17.810 --> 16:19.896
I need a partner for tipsy trivia.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.314
-You in?
-Yeah.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.316
Come on. We got some ass to kick.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.236
You ain't the only one
with a secret white friend.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.155
[Sam] Mmm.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.408
Oh.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.243
-He's talking about me.
-Yeah.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.412
[cheering]

16:36.496 --> 16:39.123
All right, all right, all right.
After the first round,

16:39.207 --> 16:43.085
Reggie and Addison are on top with ten,
and the Johnson twins have zero.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.713
[all] Zero!

16:45.796 --> 16:47.632
Are all twins this dumb?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.342
Do y'all gotta split
one brain between you?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.552
-[Muffy] Okay, okay, hands up.
-[grunts mockingly]

16:51.636 --> 16:53.471
Hands up, ready to ding in.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.181
All right, when did the French Revolutio--

16:55.264 --> 16:57.058
-[bell dings]
-1789.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.434
-Correct!
-[cheering]

16:58.518 --> 17:01.103
[piano flourish]

17:01.187 --> 17:03.272
Who was the man that went into--

17:03.356 --> 17:05.024
-[bell dings]
-[Reggie] Martin Van Buren.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.153
-[Muffy] Correct!
-[piano flourish]

17:09.237 --> 17:10.530
-[bell dinging]
-What is osmosis?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.698
Ace of Spades. Lake Titicaca.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.908
-Hyperhidrosis.
-[cheering]

17:13.991 --> 17:15.451
All right, what team came to the US

17:15.535 --> 17:17.161
-in 19--
-[bell dings]

17:17.245 --> 17:19.163
"Rockin'" Robin Yount
and the Milwaukee Brewers.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.581
-Boom!
-[cheering]

17:20.665 --> 17:22.416
[piano flourish]

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
[Reggie] Come on, y'all.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.338
This game is culturally biased against me,
and I'm still whooping that ass.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.133
I know y'all's shit <i>and</i> my shit.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.844
We are winning too hard.
Can one of y'all cheat so we can drink?

17:33.928 --> 17:36.180
All right, how about everyone
shots in the kitchen,

17:36.264 --> 17:38.224
except the Johnson twins?

17:38.307 --> 17:39.850
[cheering]

17:39.934 --> 17:41.602
-Ooh.
-Tits.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.479
Kill 'em with all
that intellectual bullshit.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.939
You're the fucking man.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.816
-The boss man!
-Okay, okay, okay.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.067
Get drunk!

17:50.528 --> 17:53.114
[Joelle chuckles]

17:53.197 --> 17:55.116
-[Reggie exhales]
-So you decided

17:55.199 --> 17:56.784
you're the master in trivia now?

17:56.867 --> 18:00.079
See, the thing about me is,
I'm smart as fuck.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.873
-I see.
-[exhales]

18:02.957 --> 18:06.294
Um, so since you got all the answers,

18:06.377 --> 18:08.629
what makes me such a good friend?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.344
[rap song playing]

18:15.428 --> 18:17.888
-[rhythmic clapping]
-Oh!

18:17.972 --> 18:18.931
Ooh.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.475

18:44.415 --> 18:45.625

18:45.708 --> 18:46.917
-Man, don't say that.
-What?

18:47.752 --> 18:49.503
You know I don't really use that word.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.465
Yeah, man, I know, but, uh...

18:52.548 --> 18:54.258
I just really heard you say it, though.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.345
And now he won't anymore.
We all learned something today.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.977
Wait, so it's bad
if I'm just repeating what's in the song?

19:05.061 --> 19:07.855
-Dude, seriously?
-No, I know. I'm sorry.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.362
But it's not like I'm a racist.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.821
Never said you were a racist.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.907
[Reggie] Just don't say "nigga."

19:17.990 --> 19:19.784
Like, you didn't have to say it just then.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.080
I guess it just felt kind of weird
to censor myself.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.082
It felt kind of weird to hear you say it.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.751
I mean, how would you feel
if I started rapping to songs,

19:28.834 --> 19:30.878
you know, that say "honky" and "cracker"?

19:30.961 --> 19:32.880
[chuckles] I wouldn't care at all.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.840
Exactly, that's the difference.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.926
The fact that you don't care and I do.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.345
Like... you get it?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.765
Reggie getting in a fight about racism.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.143
-I'm shocked.
-Somebody said "nigga" and here come Kurt.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.604
[laughs] Hey, Addison, heads up.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.440
Just hide anything
you don't want destroyed in a riot.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.733
-Bro.
-Speaking of.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.485
[Kurt] Has anyone seen Sam?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.779
This really feels like something
she would plan to make a point.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.241
Kurt, I'm good.
I just don't like being called a racist.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.451
[Joelle] Again, he never said
you were a racist.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.286
He said "don't say that word."

20:05.037 --> 20:06.247
I'm not some redneck.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.873
Is that what you think of me, Reggie?

20:07.957 --> 20:09.458
[Kurt] Yeah, Reggie.
You call your friend a racist

20:09.542 --> 20:11.419
and yet you're surprised when he's upset.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.045
[Reggie] We're friends, but suddenly,

20:13.129 --> 20:14.922
I'm supposed to give you
nigga dispensation?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.424
[Addison] Dude,
I didn't do anything wrong.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.967
It's a song. Hell, it's in the title.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.343
What am I supposed to do? Hum?

20:19.427 --> 20:20.886
-Yes, nigga.
-[Kurt] Come on, Reggie.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.638
You don't want him using
his white privilege

20:22.722 --> 20:24.265
to rewrite black art, do you?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.267
Come on, man, I been good to you.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.060
You're at a party at my house,
drinking my booze,

20:28.144 --> 20:29.353
and now you attack me?

20:29.437 --> 20:30.312
It's--

20:30.896 --> 20:32.398
Can nobody just have fun anymore?

20:32.481 --> 20:35.067
Oh, I sorry, massa.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.069
We didn't mean to ruin your fun, now.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.405
Sure, back to slavery.
It always comes back to slavery.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.532
Okay, now I'm calling you a racist.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.409
-Yeah?
-Okay, let's all just calm down

20:43.492 --> 20:45.077
and have a good time.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.496
-Troy, stay out of it.
-[man] Even our black president

20:47.580 --> 20:49.206
thinks you guys are being ridiculous.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.959
Yo, "you guys" sounds like
a real "you people" substitute.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.044
This is what happens
when a country refuses

20:54.128 --> 20:56.130
to address its history with slavery.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.673
We need to do here what they did
in Germany.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.884
-[all] What?
-I meant the educating kids

20:59.967 --> 21:02.011
about the nation's horrible past part,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.472
not the, um, concentration camp part.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.890
-Okay.
-'Cause I was about to say.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.979

21:17.109 --> 21:18.944
-I was just miming the song.
-You are saying...

21:19.028 --> 21:20.279
I didn't mean to offend you in any way.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.655
[overlapping shouting continues]

21:21.739 --> 21:23.324
[man] Where's y'all camera at?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.493
[overlapping shouting continues]

21:25.576 --> 21:26.869
See?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.788
This is why you don't say "nigga."

21:28.871 --> 21:31.499
-This is what happens.
-Man, this is not my fault.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.417
You and your friends
show up places uninvited

21:33.501 --> 21:35.669
and cause others fucking problems.

[Reggie] Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

21:43.010 --> 21:44.762
Everybody, stay where you are.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.515
-Get off him. Get off of him!
-Ah, what the fuck?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.143
Are you a student here?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.062
-What?
-We've had some complaints.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.106
-Are you a student here?
-Yeah, my tuition pays your salary.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.983
[Addison] He's a student here.
We just got into a little tiff.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.110
That's all. This is my house.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.281
I'm gonna need to see your ID.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.702
-Why you need to see my ID?
-[man] Son, I said ID.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.163
-I'm not your son.
-Reggie, do what he says.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.040
-Officer, he's a student--
-I'm not talking to you.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.884
Fuck these pigs, man.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.053
-I said show me some ID!
-[woman] Yo, he's a student!

22:26.136 --> 22:27.388
[Addison] He's a student here.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.014
Why the fuck do you guys have guns?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.558
Did I stutter? Show me some ID!

22:33.435 --> 22:35.145
[breathing heavily] Okay.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.358
I'm going in my wallet.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.167
[man] Okay.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.340
If you'd shown me that when I asked,
we could have avoided all that.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.052
Okay, party's over.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.762
If you don't live here, go home.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.890
Come on.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.351
[woman] It's awful.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.020
[woman] Think we should walk together.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.772
[murmuring]

23:25.029 --> 23:27.948

23:31.285 --> 23:32.244
[man] It's crazy.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.538
[Sam] Reggie...

23:36.665 --> 23:38.250
are you okay?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.379
[Sam] Jesus, are you okay?

23:43.297 --> 23:45.633
Are you okay, Reggie?

23:45.716 --> 23:47.509
Talk to me.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.762
Reggie, s--

24:00.439 --> 24:01.899
[knock on door]

24:03.776 --> 24:05.235
[Sam] Reggie?

24:08.572 --> 24:10.032
Reggie, are you there?

24:15.412 --> 24:18.165
I was thinking about
what happened all night.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.672
We gotta clap back...

24:24.755 --> 24:25.673
strong.
