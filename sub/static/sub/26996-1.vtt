00:18.639 --> 00:19.950
- As I've said, pledge,

00:19.950 --> 00:21.469
we can stay here all night,

00:22.815 --> 00:24.334
or we can just
call it quits now,

00:24.334 --> 00:25.611
and you can crawl back

00:25.611 --> 00:28.200
to whatever trailer
park you came from.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.205
- No, no, I, I don't wanna quit.

00:34.379 --> 00:36.105
- Then you know
what you need to do.

00:36.105 --> 00:37.623
You're the last one
we're waiting for.

00:37.623 --> 00:40.005
The other pledges finished
this task awhile ago.

00:47.806 --> 00:48.600
Do it!

00:58.161 --> 01:02.062
Very good, pledge.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.063
You honestly had me
questioning your commitment

01:04.063 --> 01:06.238
to the Delta Sigma Sigma's,

01:06.238 --> 01:07.688
but you've proven yourself

01:07.688 --> 01:10.898
to not be the whiny little
slut I took you for.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.936
Now, we have one final
task for you to complete

01:14.936 --> 01:16.697
that sister Hannah will explain.

01:16.697 --> 01:18.871
- What, one more task?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.701
You said that was the last one.

01:20.701 --> 01:23.911
- Oh, no, no, I said
this was the last day.

01:25.326 --> 01:29.158
You very much have just
one more task to complete.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.437
Sister Hannah, show her.

01:33.852 --> 01:35.025
- We as sisters share

01:35.025 --> 01:37.373
the most intimate
details with each other,

01:38.719 --> 01:41.066
and we have to make sure
you're comfortable in doing so.

01:44.552 --> 01:46.796
You have 45 seconds
to get started,

01:46.796 --> 01:48.418
or you will fail
your initiation.

01:51.249 --> 01:52.698
- This is a joke, right?

01:53.768 --> 01:54.873
- 40 seconds.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.154
- This, this isn't right.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.053
This is just sick.

02:03.053 --> 02:05.125
- So, what are you quitting?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.265
I knew it, you wasted
our fucking time.

02:07.265 --> 02:08.127
- 30 seconds.

02:09.405 --> 02:12.684
- Please, I'll do anything else.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.031
- 10 seconds.

02:25.593 --> 02:27.940
- That's
a good little whore.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.702
Now, keep going until we
tell you to stop.

03:29.174 --> 03:31.280
Well, I guess I'll
open up my gift next.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.220
Oh, it's from Angela,
charming card.

03:52.473 --> 03:54.682
Hmm, it's lovely,
thank you, Angela.

03:56.201 --> 03:57.271
But, one question.

03:59.135 --> 04:01.862
Why did you give me a
Happy Holidays card?

04:01.862 --> 04:03.208
You're not one of those
people who are like,

04:03.208 --> 04:05.383
offended by Christmas
or something, are you?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.351
- Of course not.

04:09.766 --> 04:11.527
I just thought
the card was nice.

04:11.527 --> 04:13.667
- Nice, well, we here

04:13.667 --> 04:16.635
at Delta Sigma Sigma
celebrate Christmas,

04:16.635 --> 04:19.017
not Hanukkah, Quingua,

04:19.017 --> 04:21.813
or any of those other
stupid made up holidays.

04:21.813 --> 04:24.436
So, when your card
says Happy Holidays,

04:24.436 --> 04:28.613
just which holidays are
you referring to exactly?

04:28.613 --> 04:30.304
- You're looking too far into it

04:30.304 --> 04:33.273
when you should be appreciating
the thought behind it.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.861
That is what the Christmas
season is about, correct?

04:41.522 --> 04:43.179
- Why don't you
open my gift to you?

05:02.819 --> 05:04.649
- Why
don't you use for us

05:04.649 --> 05:06.720
like you did a few
months ago.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.903
- That was fucked up.

05:17.903 --> 05:21.666
- Oh please, liberal lezzie
needed to be taken down a notch.

05:21.666 --> 05:23.978
She's been acting like she's
so much better than everyone

05:23.978 --> 05:25.083
since she's been here.

05:26.947 --> 05:28.914
I'm just reminding
her who's in charge.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.711
Now, who else has
a present for me?

05:36.197 --> 05:37.854
Anyone, that's okay.

07:18.817 --> 07:21.889
- What're you doing,
you stupid bitch?

10:30.353 --> 10:31.838
- Mm hmm.

10:31.838 --> 10:36.636
- Babe, all I was saying was
I just, I, I don't get it.

10:40.743 --> 10:44.644
Come one, why would
you pledge the same sorority

10:44.644 --> 10:46.611
where your sister was murdered?

10:46.611 --> 10:49.165
I mean, I, I don't get that.

10:49.165 --> 10:50.615
I'm not trying to
be an ass, Danielle.

10:50.615 --> 10:51.616
I just don't get it.

10:51.616 --> 10:53.860
- Well, I guess at the time

10:53.860 --> 10:56.828
it just felt like it was
a good way to honor her.

10:56.828 --> 10:59.210
You know, being part of the
house she loved so much.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.662
It's, it's sentimental
B.S., I know.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.078
- But, I, I don't like seeing
what being in this house,

11:05.078 --> 11:07.667
especially around
Christmas, is doing to you.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.669
- Well, it's my
first Christmas here.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.774
You know, it's just something
I gotta get through,

11:11.774 --> 11:14.674
but it'll get better, I promise.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.262
- Okay, kiddo,
you gonna be ready

11:17.262 --> 11:18.781
for the party Friday night?

11:18.781 --> 11:20.990
- You mean
the sorority girls

11:20.990 --> 11:23.199
dressed in slutty
Mrs. Claus outfits,

11:23.199 --> 11:25.546
and drunk frat
boys in Santa hats

11:25.546 --> 11:27.307
trying to lore them
under the mistletoe?

11:27.307 --> 11:30.172
Ah, yeah, I wouldn't
miss it.

11:30.172 --> 11:33.485
- Perfect, ah, I'm
gonna head out.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.624
I'll call you later.

11:35.833 --> 11:38.974
Can, can you just
try to get some rest?

11:38.974 --> 11:40.941
- Yeah, okay, adios.

11:54.058 --> 11:57.475
Hey, Kayla, more
cookies for the party?

11:57.475 --> 12:00.202
- You know me, a regular
Rachael Ray ,

12:01.065 --> 12:03.067
but I uh, I think Rachael Ray

12:03.067 --> 12:05.345
may have made some
prettier cookies.

12:05.345 --> 12:08.279
- Mm, you know, it's real uh,

12:08.279 --> 12:11.351
1950s Rockwell Christmas of
you to think college kids

12:11.351 --> 12:13.733
are gonna be all about the
cookies at the party.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.218
- Come on, it's a
Christmas party.

12:16.218 --> 12:17.875
There should be some decorum.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.669
- Oh, okay.

12:19.669 --> 12:22.742
- Whatever, so how's
my brother doing?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.710
- Hmm, he's good,
he's charming as ever.

12:27.125 --> 12:31.164
- Has he um, has he said if
Grant's gonna be at the party?

12:31.164 --> 12:33.753
- Oh my God, Kayla, you
just have to talk to him.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.204
- I know, I know, I, I
guess I'm old fashioned.

12:37.204 --> 12:39.793
I like when the guy
courts the girl.

12:39.793 --> 12:43.038
- You really were
born in the wrong decade.

12:43.038 --> 12:43.901
- I know, right?

12:46.110 --> 12:48.526
So, how are you doing?

12:48.526 --> 12:50.010
I mean really.

12:50.010 --> 12:54.290
I know this time of
year in this house

12:54.290 --> 12:56.223
has gotta be hard for you.

12:56.223 --> 12:57.569
- You sound like your brother.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.744
- It just means we
both care about you.

12:59.744 --> 13:04.335
- And I appreciate that,
but I'm fine, I promise.

13:04.335 --> 13:08.615
- Okay, but if you ever
need to talk or anything,

13:08.615 --> 13:09.616
my ears are yours.

13:11.756 --> 13:14.621
So, wanna help me finish
decorating these cookies?

13:14.621 --> 13:17.279
- You know, as tempting
as that offer sounds,

13:17.279 --> 13:19.005
I think I'm just
gonna go lay down.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.558
I've had some trouble
sleeping recently.

13:20.558 --> 13:25.252
- Okay, but at least take that
one you've been picking at.

13:30.050 --> 13:34.779
- Hey, thank you for being so
welcoming and understanding.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.746
It means a lot.

13:36.746 --> 13:37.920
- Yeah, sure.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.922
- Oh, it's just me.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.855
- Sorry, I just.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.822
- Oh, no need to explain, girl.

14:17.822 --> 14:20.514
Fixated on my door
for obvious reasons.

14:20.514 --> 14:22.931
I told you if you
wanted to switch rooms,

14:22.931 --> 14:24.829
although that's kind of morbid,

14:24.829 --> 14:26.520
but I'd be more than willing.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.488
- God, no, no, I already

14:28.488 --> 14:30.386
can barely sleep in
this house, so no.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.182
- I wish you
would've talked to me

14:33.182 --> 14:34.528
before you decided to pledge.

14:34.528 --> 14:36.668
- I just need to go lie down,

14:36.668 --> 14:38.739
and then this party,

14:38.739 --> 14:42.157
so I can go home and get
away from here for a bit, so.

14:42.157 --> 14:46.126
- Okay, but hey, we need
to talk, I'm serious.

14:46.126 --> 14:47.576
This isn't good for you.

14:47.576 --> 14:48.508
- I'm fine.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.475
- Bullshit, go get some rest.

14:50.475 --> 14:51.338
We'll talk later.

14:52.615 --> 14:56.585
- Okay.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.080
- All I know is someone needs

16:18.080 --> 16:20.324
to take a fucking
creative writing class.

16:20.324 --> 16:21.911
What a lame ass poem.

16:21.911 --> 16:22.843
- Be serious.

16:22.843 --> 16:24.604
- I am serious, Dani.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.986
I mean, obviously this
is just some asshole

16:26.986 --> 16:28.504
trying to get a rise out of you.

16:28.504 --> 16:31.714
I mean, Mrs. Claus, come on.

16:31.714 --> 16:34.027
- Okay, but why now?

16:34.027 --> 16:37.444
- Um, duh, it's Christmastime.

16:37.444 --> 16:40.137
Your sister was
murdered 10 years ago,

16:40.137 --> 16:41.724
and you, you walk around here

16:41.724 --> 16:43.657
like you're fucking
girl interrupted.

16:43.657 --> 16:45.280
Not even attempting
to hide the fact

16:45.280 --> 16:47.730
that being here creeps
you the hell out.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.629
Obviously, someone
picked up on this,

16:49.629 --> 16:51.113
and decided to give you shit.

16:52.252 --> 16:56.877
- I don't know, it just,
it seems so vicious.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.260
- Sorority bitches
are vicious, Dani.

17:01.779 --> 17:04.989
I mean, look at the
stories about your sister.

17:07.405 --> 17:08.786
- What do you mean by that?

17:10.166 --> 17:12.271
- So, you're gonna pretend
you haven't heard the stories?

17:12.271 --> 17:14.343
- You mean the hazing stories?

17:14.343 --> 17:16.310
It's not like she was the
only one doing those things.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.382
I mean, every sorority
and fraternity

17:18.382 --> 17:20.176
on campus was doing it.

17:20.176 --> 17:21.833
- Well, not just that,

17:21.833 --> 17:23.732
but yes, that's a
good place to start.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.289
Well, what about what she
supposedly did to that girl

17:29.289 --> 17:31.257
the night that she was killed?

17:31.257 --> 17:34.225
- I, I can't believe

17:34.225 --> 17:36.227
you're bringing
this up right now.

17:36.227 --> 17:38.540
That girl was a
fucking psychopath,

17:38.540 --> 17:42.233
and my sister, she, she played
an innocent joke on her,

17:42.233 --> 17:43.855
but that does not mean
that she deserves to--

17:43.855 --> 17:45.857
- You know that's
not what I mean,

17:47.756 --> 17:50.483
but you can't ignore
her reputation.

17:50.483 --> 17:53.348
Whether you think
it's justified or not,

17:53.348 --> 17:56.316
not many people have much
nice to say about her,

17:56.316 --> 18:00.320
and as a result, would jump at
the chance to terrorize you.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.152
- Christ, I can't deal
with this right now.

18:04.152 --> 18:05.670
I mean, ever since coming here,

18:05.670 --> 18:08.984
I've tried to not let this
whole fucked up scenario

18:08.984 --> 18:10.158
of living in the same house

18:10.158 --> 18:13.057
where my sister was
murdered bother me, but.

18:13.057 --> 18:14.507
- That was your choice, Dani.

18:14.507 --> 18:18.683
- I know that, okay,
but does not mean

18:18.683 --> 18:21.410
I deserve to be harassed
by some asshole.

18:25.173 --> 18:27.071
- You're right, here.

18:29.384 --> 18:30.385
- What're you doing?

18:32.214 --> 18:33.491
No, don't waste your.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.837
- Sent.

18:48.472 --> 18:49.404
- Ah, fuck.

18:54.857 --> 18:55.858
- Who was that?

18:55.858 --> 18:57.066
- Well, just Jake.

18:58.827 --> 19:00.829
- And you're not
gonna respond to him?

19:00.829 --> 19:01.692
- Does it matter?

19:02.934 --> 19:04.246
- Apparently not.

19:09.493 --> 19:13.393
So, are you gonna miss
me over break, hmm, hmm?

19:15.119 --> 19:15.947
- Yeah, sure.

19:17.466 --> 19:18.295
- Convincing.

19:22.264 --> 19:24.197
- I'll miss fucking you.

19:24.197 --> 19:27.683
- Oh, nice,
but I'm sure Grant boy

19:27.683 --> 19:30.169
has plenty of girls
lined up to fuck.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.482
- Mm, yeah but,
you're one of my favs.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.527
- I should go, it's gonna
be getting dark soon.

19:44.838 --> 19:46.564
- You're really
driving home tonight?

19:47.807 --> 19:49.740
It's like three hours away.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.880
Plus, you're gonna miss
your sorority's party.

19:55.297 --> 19:57.920
- I'm not much for
Christmas parties.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.095
- Alcohol and me?

20:00.095 --> 20:01.027
What's not to like?

20:07.896 --> 20:12.245
- So, is that an invitation
to take me to the party, hmm?

20:15.455 --> 20:17.733
I didn't think so.

20:20.564 --> 20:24.809
Listen, you have
a Merry Christmas.

20:24.809 --> 20:27.122
- You get like this
every time we fuck.

20:29.469 --> 20:30.988
- Then stop fucking me, Grant.

21:04.539 --> 21:05.885
- You want some help?

21:05.885 --> 21:08.025
- Oh, no thanks.

21:08.025 --> 21:10.234
You know me, a perfectionist.

21:10.234 --> 21:12.132
- I've noticed, you know,

21:12.132 --> 21:14.721
I just don't understand why
you put in so effort to a tree

21:14.721 --> 21:17.793
when no one really stays
here for, hey Soph.

21:17.793 --> 21:18.898
Late day at work?

21:18.898 --> 21:21.107
- Nah, I was with Grant.

21:23.212 --> 21:24.248
I'm just gonna bring my bags.

21:24.248 --> 21:25.525
I need to get on the road.

21:26.906 --> 21:29.218
- Are you sure you can't
stay here for the party?

21:30.358 --> 21:31.220
- Nope.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.305
- Can I help you?

22:57.272 --> 23:01.207
- Ah, I'm a, I'm
Angela's mother.

23:04.969 --> 23:08.939
The girl that was murdered
here 10 years ago.

23:08.939 --> 23:12.321
- Of course, I recognize
you from the news.

23:14.358 --> 23:17.223
I thought Angela
committed suici--

23:17.223 --> 23:21.572
- She, she was murdered.

23:23.263 --> 23:25.611
- I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to um,

23:26.819 --> 23:28.717
Mrs. Werner, what
can I do for you.

23:28.717 --> 23:32.859
- Look, is, is, is that Danielle
King really living here?

23:33.998 --> 23:37.208
- Yeah, but I think
she's sleeping.

23:39.625 --> 23:44.423
- Well, I need to speak to her.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.252
Please, you go get her.

23:46.252 --> 23:48.668
- I don't know if that's a
good idea, I mean she's--

23:48.668 --> 23:53.397
- Please, I, I've
tried for years

23:53.397 --> 23:55.641
to gain closure for
my daughter's death.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.611
This is something I need to do.

24:01.819 --> 24:02.993
- I thought you were sleeping?

24:02.993 --> 24:04.373
- I heard the doorbell.

24:04.373 --> 24:06.065
What're you doing here?

24:06.065 --> 24:09.344
- Oh, so it's true?

24:11.795 --> 24:16.800
Why child, why
would you live here

24:18.387 --> 24:21.770
when your blood has caused nothing
but pain and destruction.

24:23.151 --> 24:27.845
This house is forever tainted
because of your sister!

24:28.708 --> 24:29.882
- What're you talking about?

24:29.882 --> 24:31.918
Your daughter
murdered my sister.

24:31.918 --> 24:33.644
- Please, let's calm
down, I don't think--

24:33.644 --> 24:35.025
- Your sister was evil!

24:38.304 --> 24:39.132
I knew it!

24:41.272 --> 24:42.446
Angela knew it!

24:43.792 --> 24:47.658
You know it and your living here

24:47.658 --> 24:51.420
is a slap in the face to
my daughter and her memory.

24:51.420 --> 24:54.078
- That's enough, please,
I think you need to leave.

24:57.461 --> 25:02.397
- Look at you,
you're just like your sister.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.781
You can't help it.

25:08.127 --> 25:11.302
Selfishness and evil
run through veins.

25:13.546 --> 25:18.551
Well, I'm gonna move
on knowing that fact,

25:20.035 --> 25:23.832
but believe that I wish you
only pain from living here,

25:25.316 --> 25:30.321
and I pray that this Christmas
fills you with anguish.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.126
- Are you okay?

25:42.126 --> 25:44.853
Please, don't,
don't listen to her.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.717
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:46.717 --> 25:47.925
I'm used to her.

25:47.925 --> 25:50.549
I just didn't think
she'd come here.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.966
- Grief can make
people do crazy things.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.899
- What was all
that yelling about?

25:55.899 --> 25:58.280
- Never mind, remember
we have a party

25:58.280 --> 25:59.592
to prepare for tomorrow.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.629
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:03.078 --> 26:04.977
- I'm sorry you had
to deal with her.

26:05.874 --> 26:07.842
Go upstairs, shake it off.

26:07.842 --> 26:10.638
Get some rest, call Kyle.

26:54.992 --> 26:56.235
- Hey!

26:56.235 --> 26:58.306
- Hey, Danielle,
are you, are you good?

26:58.306 --> 27:00.066
Kayla texted me, just
told me what happened.

27:00.066 --> 27:01.723
- Of course she did.

27:01.723 --> 27:03.069
Ah yeah, I'm fine.

27:03.069 --> 27:05.209
I'm a little shaken
up, but I'm fine.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.833
- Oh my God, hopefully
that crazy bitch is gone,

27:07.833 --> 27:10.629
but Danielle, you
have to promise me

27:10.629 --> 27:13.183
if she comes back you're
gonna call the police.

27:13.183 --> 27:16.048
- Yeah, we'll see, I mean,
she's mostly harmless.

27:16.048 --> 27:18.395
She's harassed my family before,

27:18.395 --> 27:20.362
but she's more annoying
than anything else.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.055
- Ah shit,
okay, Jake's here.

27:23.055 --> 27:25.471
I gotta go, but if anything
else happens call me.

27:25.471 --> 27:27.197
Um and, if not, I'll
see you tomorrow.

27:27.197 --> 27:29.371
Can you bring the sexy
Santa Claus outfit.

27:29.371 --> 27:30.269
I really like that.

27:30.269 --> 27:31.615
- Yes, sir.

27:31.615 --> 27:32.823
- I love you.

27:32.823 --> 27:33.686
- Yeah, ditto.

28:00.955 --> 28:04.061
- Hello, Delta Sigma Sigma
house, this is Kayla speaking.

28:07.202 --> 28:09.964
Oh hi, Mrs. Benson.

28:09.964 --> 28:11.068
No, Sophie isn't here.

28:11.068 --> 28:12.691
She left last night.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.692
She isn't home yet?

28:17.178 --> 28:20.215
That's strange, yeah, she
definitely left last night.

28:22.977 --> 28:25.773
Of course, I'll ask around
and get back to you.

28:27.153 --> 28:28.396
I'm sure she's fine.

28:30.985 --> 28:34.643
Bye, and please, let me
know if you hear from her.

28:43.791 --> 28:46.517
- Whoa, good
morning, jumpy today?

28:46.517 --> 28:50.970
- No, I'm sorry, I
guess I was daydreaming.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.076
- Who called, huh?

28:53.076 --> 28:55.872
- Oh, wrong number.

28:55.872 --> 28:59.945
- Oh, so about
the party tonight,

28:59.945 --> 29:03.431
don't be too surprised if
not too many people show up.

29:03.431 --> 29:05.191
- So I've been told.

29:05.191 --> 29:06.434
- Well, I just wanna
be real with you.

29:06.434 --> 29:07.987
You've worked so
hard on all this,

29:07.987 --> 29:10.058
and I just don't
want you to be hurt,

29:10.058 --> 29:13.337
because word is not too
many people are coming.

29:13.337 --> 29:15.270
Most have already left campus.

29:15.270 --> 29:18.480
- You know me,
constant optimist.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.068
Look, I'm sure the
turnout will be fine,

29:20.068 --> 29:23.623
whether is five people or
a hundred and five people.

29:23.623 --> 29:24.763
It's really about celebrating

29:24.763 --> 29:27.213
the true meaning of the holiday.

29:27.213 --> 29:29.871
- Okay, well, I'll talk
to you later, okay.

29:29.871 --> 29:33.150
- Yeah, oh wait, um, Kyle's
taking Danielle and me

29:33.150 --> 29:35.428
to get some last
minute party stuff.

29:35.428 --> 29:38.431
Can you please put the finishing
touches on the decorations?

29:38.431 --> 29:41.883
- Yeah,
yeah, whatever, bye.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.298
- Thanks.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.500
Cornell, do you copy?

30:14.502 --> 30:16.159
- Yes, what is it, over.

30:16.159 --> 30:17.816
- I'm sending
a call to your cellphone,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.784
a Mrs. Benson, says her
daughter left campus last night,

30:20.784 --> 30:22.406
but hasn't made it home.

30:22.406 --> 30:24.029
Seems pretty upset.

30:24.029 --> 30:26.169
Sounds like she needs to
talk to another woman.

30:26.169 --> 30:28.274
- Okay, oh, and
that's an example

30:28.274 --> 30:31.415
of the sexism I was
talking about, over.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.692
- Sure, doll.

30:32.692 --> 30:34.936
Let me know if you need
anything, over and out.

30:43.324 --> 30:48.087
- Good afternoon, officer,
care to make a donation?

30:48.087 --> 30:50.089
It's for the little
ones in the hospital.

30:53.506 --> 30:56.406
Much appreciated, you
have a blessed Christmas.

30:56.406 --> 30:57.200
- You too, sir.

32:00.988 --> 32:03.162
- Hello, Kayla, Danielle!

32:08.685 --> 32:10.100
Is that you guys?

32:35.263 --> 32:36.437
What the hell?

34:08.839 --> 34:12.188
- So, as each year passes,

34:12.188 --> 34:16.399
and a new batch of freshman
infiltrate our quaint campus,

34:17.538 --> 34:19.540
the memory of that
brutal murder, suicide

34:19.540 --> 34:22.060
that took place here fades,

34:22.060 --> 34:27.065
and is replaced by numerous,
more salacious stories.

34:30.723 --> 34:34.036
However, that does not diminish

34:34.036 --> 34:36.971
the terrible scar
that event left here.

34:36.971 --> 34:41.734
Not only on this town, but
on this school as well.

34:43.943 --> 34:48.120
It should be a reminder that
our actions have consequences.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.123
When we allow
systems to be set up

34:51.123 --> 34:55.783
that encourage and relish
in requiring young people

34:55.783 --> 35:00.063
to beg and humiliate themselves
in order to gain acceptance,

35:00.063 --> 35:01.547
than we shouldn't be surprised

35:01.547 --> 35:04.619
when something like the Delta
Sigma Sigma tragedy occurs.

35:14.319 --> 35:19.324
Anyway friends, that is
an end to this episode.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.982
Until next week, this
is Tyler signing off.

35:37.445 --> 35:38.929
- You know, this is
some serious overkill

35:38.929 --> 35:40.931
for the five people
that are gonna show.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.796
- Yeah, kinda looks
Christmas vomited in here.

35:44.659 --> 35:45.798
- Kayla likes it.

35:47.006 --> 35:50.286
- Hey, Madison still
hasn't shown up?

35:50.286 --> 35:53.047
You really can't
count on anyone anymore.

35:53.047 --> 35:55.325
Guess being a sister
means nothing to her.

35:55.325 --> 35:56.326
Come on, help with the snacks.

35:56.326 --> 35:57.741
Guests will be here any minute.

35:57.741 --> 35:59.329
- I got it, I got it.

35:59.329 --> 36:04.265
- Okay, uh, sparkling
juice, really?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.235
You might as well
just gotten them milk.

36:08.235 --> 36:09.822
- It's B-Y-O-B.

36:09.822 --> 36:11.376
If the frat boys
wanna get drunk,

36:11.376 --> 36:13.032
they can do it on
their own dime.

36:14.448 --> 36:15.932
- You know, you
really miss the entire point

36:15.932 --> 36:17.520
of being in a
sorority, don't you?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.871
- Ho, ho, ho, hoes.

36:25.252 --> 36:27.564
Who's ready to get smashed
in the name of Santa?

36:27.564 --> 36:29.946
- Hell to the yes, and
Jake is in the house.

36:31.396 --> 36:33.467
- I'm glad you could all make
it to the Delta Sigma Sigma's

36:33.467 --> 36:35.193
traditional Christmas
celebration.

36:39.404 --> 36:40.819
- Sneaky, little bastard.

36:48.378 --> 36:50.415
- So uh, who else is
supposed to show up

36:50.415 --> 36:52.589
to this uh, little fiesta?

36:52.589 --> 36:55.351
- I'm not sure, anyone
on campus can come.

36:55.351 --> 36:57.767
- But, most everyone's
gone now for break.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.734
- Well hey, that's fine.

36:59.734 --> 37:01.219
We can have our
own little party.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.670
Who actually believes that more
is merrier bullshit anyways?

37:04.670 --> 37:05.499
- I don't.

37:06.914 --> 37:09.399
- So, when did your house
start having this party again?

37:09.399 --> 37:11.470
I heard that after what happened

37:11.470 --> 37:13.679
they stopped doing
it for awhile,

37:13.679 --> 37:15.094
out of respect or something.

37:15.094 --> 37:16.786
- I'm not sure.

37:16.786 --> 37:18.443
I just took it over this year.

37:18.443 --> 37:21.894
- So, can we talk about
what happened here,

37:21.894 --> 37:24.000
you know, that
murder, suicide thing?

37:24.000 --> 37:24.828
- Dude.

37:25.967 --> 37:27.348
- Oh shit, my bad, dude.

37:28.798 --> 37:31.007
Wasn't one of them like
your cousin or something?

37:31.939 --> 37:34.907
- Sister, one was my sister.

37:39.395 --> 37:41.466
But that doesn't mean we
don't have to talk about it.

37:41.466 --> 37:42.743
- I don't really think

37:42.743 --> 37:43.985
that's a good idea,
Dani, we shouldn't--

37:43.985 --> 37:45.608
- Now, was your sister
the who was killed,

37:45.608 --> 37:47.541
or the one who killed herself?

37:47.541 --> 37:50.337
- She was um, the
one who was killed.

37:52.994 --> 37:55.514
- I heard it was over some
prank, is that, is that true?

37:55.514 --> 37:58.517
- Jesus, guys, it's called tact.

37:58.517 --> 37:59.760
- Seriously.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.900
- No, it's okay, really.

38:01.900 --> 38:02.728
I can talk about it.

38:02.728 --> 38:03.557
I'm not that fragile.

38:04.937 --> 38:06.422
- I don't know, are you sure?

38:06.422 --> 38:07.871
- Yeah, it was a prank.

38:09.356 --> 38:11.012
My sister and some
of the other girls,

38:11.012 --> 38:13.567
it was just some
typical hazing stuff.

38:14.706 --> 38:16.190
It got out of hand,

38:16.190 --> 38:20.332
but if Amber would've
known the girl had issues,

38:21.506 --> 38:23.301
then she wouldn't
have taken that far.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.958
- What I
can't understand

38:25.958 --> 38:27.995
is why you would
pledge to a sorority

38:27.995 --> 38:30.860
that allowed your
sister to bully a girl

38:30.860 --> 38:32.310
leading to their deaths.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.348
Better yet, why are
sororities and fraternities

38:36.348 --> 38:39.144
even allowed to exist
on this campus anymore?

38:40.559 --> 38:42.458
- It's a good thing you don't
have to understand it, man.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.356
Okay, Danielle is capable of--

38:44.356 --> 38:46.945
- Sororities and frats
have this type of history

38:48.222 --> 38:50.293
of abuse and bullying,

38:51.605 --> 38:53.745
which caused the deaths
that happened here,

38:55.333 --> 38:58.232
and as long as
sheep keep pledging

38:58.232 --> 39:00.199
these outdated institutions,

39:00.199 --> 39:03.064
then we as a society
are saying it's okay.

39:04.894 --> 39:07.724
So, don't be surprised if
it happens again, Danielle.

39:07.724 --> 39:12.522
- You can not be seriously
blaming sororities for murder.

39:12.522 --> 39:14.179
- Yet, here he is.

39:14.179 --> 39:15.594
- Come on dude!

39:15.594 --> 39:17.803
Frats have nothing
to do with murder.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.704
You wanna know how to
avoid getting killed?

39:21.704 --> 39:23.361
- How?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.396
- You be ugly.

39:25.259 --> 39:26.709
- What?

39:26.709 --> 39:30.160
- Seriously, you don't see
ugly people getting murdered.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.336
Serial killers just
aren't interested in them,

39:33.336 --> 39:38.341
and Jason, Michael, and Freddy,

39:39.204 --> 39:40.412
they don't go after the uglies.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.519
- Then you're
definitely safe, man.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.488
- Knock, knock.

39:47.488 --> 39:51.768
- Shit, definitely not
the guest I had in mind.

39:51.768 --> 39:54.219
- Relax, I'm not
overly concerned

39:54.219 --> 39:57.395
about your alcohol
consumption, yet.

39:58.844 --> 40:01.399
Have any of you seen Sophie
Benson since last evening?

40:02.814 --> 40:07.474
- No, I saw her last night
before she headed home, why?

40:07.474 --> 40:10.684
- Interesting, anyone else?

40:10.684 --> 40:13.618
- No, she isn't home?

40:13.618 --> 40:15.378
- I assume you already know that

40:15.378 --> 40:17.035
since you talked to
her mother this morning

40:17.035 --> 40:19.658
about her not making
it home, correct?

40:19.658 --> 40:21.453
You're Kayla, right?

40:21.453 --> 40:23.144
- Is that who
called this morning?

40:23.144 --> 40:24.663
You said it was a wrong number.

40:24.663 --> 40:25.940
- Wait, Kayla, why would you--

40:25.940 --> 40:26.769
- Stop.

40:27.908 --> 40:29.357
- I need to know
who the last person

40:29.357 --> 40:31.946
to speak with Sophie
was and what she said.

40:34.570 --> 40:37.676
Did she say she was
for sure going home?

40:37.676 --> 40:42.198
- Yes, yes, she for sure left
last night with her things.

40:42.198 --> 40:44.407
- Was this before or
after she was with you?

40:45.753 --> 40:47.272
- After.

40:47.272 --> 40:49.308
- Then why is her vehicle
parked at your place?

40:49.308 --> 40:53.451
- What, no, she definitely
headed out last night,

40:53.451 --> 40:55.936
and her car was nowhere
near my place today.

40:55.936 --> 40:58.179
- Well, it's there
now, plain as day.

40:59.629 --> 41:02.149
Listen, if you know where
she is, please tell me.

41:02.149 --> 41:03.530
Her mother is worried sick.

41:09.225 --> 41:12.608
Fine, in light of this
little development,

41:12.608 --> 41:15.645
I suggest you forget all
about this little party.

41:15.645 --> 41:18.579
We'll be making sure
that nobody else attends.

41:18.579 --> 41:20.098
In the meantime,

41:20.098 --> 41:21.927
I ask that none of travel
too far away from here.

41:21.927 --> 41:24.516
I'm sure I'll need
to talk to you again.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.760
- Are we like under
arrest or something?

41:26.760 --> 41:28.071
- No, of course not.

41:29.072 --> 41:30.004
Should you be?

41:32.248 --> 41:33.905
I just need you all
to be as concerned

41:33.905 --> 41:36.010
about finding your
friend as I am.

41:36.010 --> 41:37.736
That means I need
you to stay close,

41:37.736 --> 41:39.497
so I can get more information.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.258
And no more booze.

41:42.258 --> 41:44.156
I'll appreciate
your cooperation.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.200
- Isn't she just
like a rent-a-cop?

41:54.442 --> 41:56.410
Do we really have
to listen to her?

41:56.410 --> 41:58.792
- Wait, so why
didn't you mention

41:58.792 --> 42:00.863
talking to Sophie's
mom yesterday,

42:00.863 --> 42:02.520
when she said she
didn't make it home?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.107
Why did you lie
about who called?

42:04.107 --> 42:05.592
- I don't know.

42:05.592 --> 42:08.664
I just assumed she shacked
up with some other guy.

42:08.664 --> 42:10.597
- Kayla, you still
should've told us.

42:10.597 --> 42:12.012
- Exactly.

42:12.012 --> 42:13.254
- What if, what if something
bad happened to her.

42:13.254 --> 42:14.946
- Wait, are you
sure that she said

42:14.946 --> 42:16.395
she was going home last night?

42:16.395 --> 42:18.846
- Yes, I texted her
after we hooked up,

42:18.846 --> 42:21.331
and she responded back
saying she was heading out.

42:21.331 --> 42:23.023
- I'm not gonna get
involved in this

42:23.023 --> 42:24.645
if you guys did
something to her.

42:24.645 --> 42:26.198
I barely knew her.

42:26.198 --> 42:27.786
- Do you think a
few of us should go

42:27.786 --> 42:30.582
and see if we can find her, or?

42:30.582 --> 42:34.655
- Well, the food and
the uh, the booze is here,

42:34.655 --> 42:37.555
so uh, this is where my ass
is staying for the time being.

42:40.178 --> 42:42.180
- Come on, dude, you're
really gonna fucking light up

42:42.180 --> 42:45.079
with Officer Snoopy
Tits snooping around?

42:45.079 --> 42:48.117
- Yeah.

42:52.673 --> 42:56.988
Fuck her, seriously,
she's just a rent-a-cop.

42:56.988 --> 42:58.265
What is she gonna do?

42:58.265 --> 43:01.993
- No, no, we all
should stay here.

43:01.993 --> 43:05.306
- Okay, but um, can I
talk to you privately?

43:05.306 --> 43:07.205
- Yeah, okay, I'm outta here,

43:07.205 --> 43:08.447
because I don't
wanna be involved

43:08.447 --> 43:10.415
in another part of your
sorority house drama,

43:10.415 --> 43:12.106
which involves the cops again.

43:16.007 --> 43:17.491
Fuck you.

43:17.491 --> 43:21.046
- Wait, don't go, or at
least let me walk with you.

43:21.046 --> 43:22.565
- Yeah, sure, come on.

43:26.707 --> 43:29.676
- Talk about drama.

43:29.676 --> 43:32.851
- I know, right,
Tyler's a little pussy.

43:32.851 --> 43:35.198
So, rent-a-cop,
she's so serious.

43:35.198 --> 43:36.027
What the fuck?

43:37.545 --> 43:41.101
This is some like, Law and
Order, SUV shit, right?

43:41.101 --> 43:43.206
- SVU, dumb ass.

43:46.244 --> 43:49.765
- What's up, babe, are you
worried about Sophie or what?

43:49.765 --> 43:51.283
- No, no, I'm sure she's fine.

43:51.283 --> 43:54.528
I just wanted away from
the craziness down there.

43:54.528 --> 43:56.530
- Oh, okay, yeah,
that's fine.

43:56.530 --> 44:01.431
- Yeah, also, I wanted
to give you this.

44:02.881 --> 44:05.021
- Um, no way, if I had known,
I would've brought your gift.

44:05.021 --> 44:05.850
It's at home.

44:05.850 --> 44:06.678
- Just, open it.

44:08.611 --> 44:11.510
- Okay.

44:17.689 --> 44:21.762
- So you can stop being
late to all of our dates.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.076
- I fucking love you.

44:26.077 --> 44:28.562
And I love this.

44:28.562 --> 44:30.288
Thank you, babe.

44:30.288 --> 44:33.360
- And uh, you can give me
my present when I get back.

44:34.361 --> 44:36.466
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

44:36.466 --> 44:37.675
- Tomorrow?

44:37.675 --> 44:40.091
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I
didn't tell you sooner.

44:40.091 --> 44:43.646
I just really need to get
away and clear my mind.

44:43.646 --> 44:46.304
Plus, my mom really needs
me this time of year.

44:46.304 --> 44:48.996
- Uh, yeah, no, of course.

44:48.996 --> 44:51.136
That's, that is fine.

44:51.136 --> 44:54.381
You know, we will celebrate
as soon as you get back.

44:54.381 --> 44:55.762
- Mm hmm.

44:55.762 --> 44:59.351
- And in the meantime,
I just remembered,

44:59.351 --> 45:01.146
I actually do have
a gift for you.

45:01.146 --> 45:02.630
- Really?

45:02.630 --> 45:04.771
- Yeah, it just uh, requires
me to take my shirt off.

45:04.771 --> 45:05.633
- Yeah?

45:05.633 --> 45:06.531
- Maybe my pants.

45:06.531 --> 45:07.774
- Real slick.

45:07.774 --> 45:09.327
You're doing a good
job with that shirt.

45:09.327 --> 45:10.708
- It's a very tight shirt.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.744
- Yeah.

45:12.744 --> 45:13.607
- All right, you know what?

45:13.607 --> 45:14.642
Fuck the shirt.

45:14.642 --> 45:18.370
- Yeah.

45:24.998 --> 45:26.689
- It's kind of cold, huh?

45:26.689 --> 45:28.967
- Oh well, take my jacket.

45:33.592 --> 45:34.593
Here you go.

45:35.767 --> 45:36.734
- Thanks, Tyler.

45:37.562 --> 45:38.459
- Yeah, of course.

45:39.909 --> 45:42.912
- Hey, thanks for staying and
you know, hanging out with me.

45:42.912 --> 45:45.225
I don't know how much
more of them I could take.

45:47.986 --> 45:49.401
- Then why do you live here?

45:51.438 --> 45:53.820
- Wow, you really are
anti-sorority, aren't you?

45:57.824 --> 46:01.828
Well, I'm the first in my
family to go to college,

46:01.828 --> 46:06.039
and I guess I just wanted to
embrace the whole experience,

46:06.039 --> 46:08.938
and Greek Life just seemed
to be a requirement.

46:10.526 --> 46:13.391
- But you seem so different
from the rest of them.

46:13.391 --> 46:15.462
- Why, because I'm black?

46:15.462 --> 46:17.395
- No, no, no, no, that's
not at all what I meant.

46:17.395 --> 46:21.157
- I'm just
fucking with you.

46:22.607 --> 46:25.265
Is that a smile on
Tyler Hudson's face?

46:25.265 --> 46:26.576
Alert the press.

46:29.787 --> 46:34.170
- My apologies, just
being in a house

46:34.170 --> 46:36.103
where two people needlessly died

46:36.103 --> 46:38.243
just kind of dampens
my spirits, you know.

46:39.935 --> 46:44.940
- Yeah, I like your podcasts.

46:48.564 --> 46:51.015
- Thank you, I
really didn't think

46:51.015 --> 46:52.740
anyone around here
listened to it.

46:54.156 --> 46:57.366
- Well, I do, and I think
you have a great voice,

46:59.057 --> 47:01.404
among other things.

47:03.682 --> 47:04.511
- Thanks.

47:15.487 --> 47:16.937
You know I'm gay, right?

47:18.145 --> 47:19.215
- Seriously?

47:25.981 --> 47:27.465
Don't I feel like an asshole?

47:28.846 --> 47:33.091
- No, no, no, I, you don't,
you're not an asshole.

47:33.091 --> 47:34.990
I'm actually
incredibly flattered,

47:34.990 --> 47:36.957
and it was really sweet.

47:36.957 --> 47:38.441
- Yeah, right.

47:42.100 --> 47:45.414
Hey, I should um, probably get
back to the party, you know.

47:45.414 --> 47:47.450
It is our party, so
I should be in there.

47:48.382 --> 47:50.177
I'll talk to you later.

47:50.177 --> 47:51.006
- Yeah, okay.

47:52.559 --> 47:53.387
- Okay.

47:57.322 --> 48:02.258
- Monica, you can be
on my podcast sometime.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.850
- Sure Tyler, that'd be neat.

48:37.915 --> 48:42.920
- Monica, what can we
talk about on my podcast?

48:46.578 --> 48:48.926
How about the guys that
you're interested in?

48:52.239 --> 48:54.621
Or we could talk about
the sorority system.

49:00.075 --> 49:03.699
Yeah, I can find out
more about that family.

49:05.908 --> 49:07.634
I'm gonna text you right now.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.477
- I suppose I should go back

49:57.477 --> 49:59.858
and join this
wonderfully shitty party.

50:02.516 --> 50:03.828
What the hell, you guys?

50:05.002 --> 50:07.625
- Sorry, I'm sorry,
I had to do that.

50:07.625 --> 50:10.007
We're just going out back
for some uh, you know.

50:11.905 --> 50:13.493
All of the time.

50:13.493 --> 50:16.565
- Whatever, but Tyler
might still be out there.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.534
- I'll just tell that gay
ass to come back inside.

50:20.534 --> 50:22.122
- Did everybody know?

50:23.537 --> 50:26.713
Hey, if that cop comes back
your asses are gonna get busted.

50:27.783 --> 50:29.026
- Rent-a-cop.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.867
Tyler, you out here, bro?

50:46.802 --> 50:48.045
I guess not.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.253
We got the whole place
to ourselves, babe.

50:49.253 --> 50:50.288
- Cool, let's go.

50:50.288 --> 50:51.151
- I don't.

50:53.395 --> 50:56.122
I was thinking we could go
somewhere a little more private.

50:56.122 --> 50:59.159
- Well, like where?

50:59.159 --> 51:00.436
- In there.

51:00.436 --> 51:02.921
- Seriously, you
wanna go in there?

51:02.921 --> 51:05.545
- You want that cop to
come back and come bust us?

51:15.727 --> 51:19.559
- So, um, you guys are
6-1 this year, right?

51:19.559 --> 51:20.905
That's, that's really good.

51:22.251 --> 51:24.598
- Yeah, we would've actually
won the last game too,

51:24.598 --> 51:26.462
if Brandt didn't fucking fumble.

51:27.843 --> 51:30.984
- Uh, yeah, geez, that sounds
pretty rough.

51:30.984 --> 51:32.986
- It was pretty rough.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.126
You follow football?

51:36.472 --> 51:41.201
- Oh um, I guess I don't
really like football that much,

51:42.306 --> 51:46.586
as kind of follow
around the school team.

51:47.759 --> 51:51.004
- Huh well, hey,
that's, that's cool.

51:51.004 --> 51:51.832
Thanks for asking.

51:51.832 --> 51:52.799
- Oh, yeah, totally.

52:22.829 --> 52:24.279
- That was great.

52:24.279 --> 52:29.146
I mean, I have missed
that these last few weeks.

52:29.767 --> 52:30.802
- Yeah, I bet.

52:31.734 --> 52:33.598
- Not like that, you know.

52:33.598 --> 52:38.603
I, I, I mean how in sync
I feel with you tonight.

52:39.777 --> 52:44.195
Like, you're into me and
nothing else matters.

52:45.369 --> 52:46.715
- Well, tonight nothing
else does.

52:48.337 --> 52:49.580
- I love you, Danielle.

52:52.514 --> 52:57.277
Well, we need to get
downstairs and see the others

52:57.277 --> 52:58.899
before they start to
wonder what happened.

52:58.899 --> 53:00.453
- Yeah, you're right.

53:00.453 --> 53:01.661
Okay, let's go.

53:07.943 --> 53:11.774
- Today has been a
crazy fucking night.

53:13.949 --> 53:17.711
First the cop comes and
then Sophie missing.

53:19.057 --> 53:24.062
- Yeah, and his face

53:25.236 --> 53:27.204
when she said Sophie's
car was at his place.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.999
- I know, it's like she pulled

53:29.999 --> 53:31.898
some Gone Girl
shit or something.

53:31.898 --> 53:34.659
That crazy bitch is
so obsessed with him.

53:35.936 --> 53:39.526
- Well, Grant is pretty hot.

53:39.526 --> 53:41.079
I mean, I'd fuck him.

53:43.737 --> 53:44.566
- What?

53:44.566 --> 53:46.533
- What?

53:46.533 --> 53:48.155
- Does everybody wanna fuck him?

53:54.023 --> 53:58.545
Oh, like, so you know
that was a one time thing.

53:59.684 --> 54:04.482
- Yeah, sorry, I
just really miss you.

54:08.072 --> 54:10.695
- Hey, uh, uh, uh, stay.

54:11.903 --> 54:13.491
I got you something.

54:13.491 --> 54:14.320
- What?

54:15.528 --> 54:17.323
- This little thing.

54:22.811 --> 54:25.503
- You're such a dork.

54:30.819 --> 54:33.442
- Do I even need to ask
what you two were doing?

54:33.442 --> 54:35.617
- Hell yeah, Kyle, my man.

54:39.862 --> 54:43.832
- Okay, how about we liven
up this party a little bit

54:43.832 --> 54:47.422
since everyone seems
to be a bit on edge.

54:51.909 --> 54:56.914
- Seriously, look,
what the fuck is this?

54:57.639 --> 54:58.295
- Shh, shh.

54:58.295 --> 54:59.123
- Relax, Grant.

54:59.123 --> 55:00.297
- Just feel the vibe.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.781
- Not everything can be techno.

55:01.781 --> 55:06.372
- This is ridiculous.

55:06.372 --> 55:07.304
- Close your eyes.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.132
- Yo, this is a party, right?

55:08.926 --> 55:10.168
It's a fucking party.

55:10.168 --> 55:11.584
- How much gel do you
put in your hair, Grant?

55:13.310 --> 55:15.242
Like, on a daily basis?

55:15.242 --> 55:16.968
- How much lube do you
put on your pussy, bro?

55:18.936 --> 55:19.764
- A fuck ton!

55:27.738 --> 55:28.946
- Come here.

55:28.946 --> 55:30.603
- Where did you get
this?

55:30.603 --> 55:33.053
- Um, I don't know actually.

55:33.053 --> 55:35.642
I got it, I got it from a guy.

55:35.642 --> 55:39.439
I was underground,
yeah, in like a sewer,

55:39.439 --> 55:42.028
and he had like this mask,

55:42.028 --> 55:43.409
kind of looked like a clown.

55:45.065 --> 55:46.343
Something like that.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.930
Yeah, I got it from
him and he was like,

55:49.276 --> 55:52.866
hey, do you want, you
want some uh, some weed?

55:52.866 --> 55:56.456
And I'm like, yeah
bro, hit me up,

55:56.456 --> 55:58.251
and then yeah,
that's how I got it.

55:59.217 --> 56:00.978
Kind of tastes like seaweed.

56:00.978 --> 56:02.289
- You got it from a sewer.

56:04.844 --> 56:05.948
Are you sure it's pot?

56:05.948 --> 56:07.122
- No, I'm not.

56:08.088 --> 56:09.642
Tastes like horse butt.

56:16.442 --> 56:19.997
You think, you think
Santa gets high?

56:19.997 --> 56:23.000
- Oh yeah, Santa
definitely gets high.

56:26.072 --> 56:28.385
I mean, I'd have to get high

56:28.385 --> 56:30.870
if I was riding around
on a sleigh all night.

56:30.870 --> 56:34.218
- Right, like, you know, he's
like, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer!

56:35.702 --> 56:37.704
Dixon, whatever the rest.

56:37.704 --> 56:38.740
- Rudolph.

56:38.740 --> 56:40.327
- Rudolph, Rudolph is one them.

56:42.399 --> 56:43.883
It's like his nose is lit up.

56:43.883 --> 56:46.679
Like who, you have to be high
if you thought about that.

56:46.679 --> 56:48.922
- Or he's just cold.

56:48.922 --> 56:50.303
- Yeah, you're right.

56:52.098 --> 56:55.032
- Do you think that Santa
gets high with his elves?

56:56.896 --> 56:57.828
- He has to.

56:57.828 --> 56:59.381
- They have to.

56:59.381 --> 57:00.900
- Yeah, he has to get high.

57:00.900 --> 57:02.798
You know, like, they work
so hard, and they're like,

57:02.798 --> 57:04.869
do, do, do, all right, we
made enough toys for today,

57:04.869 --> 57:06.664
let's go take a break.

57:06.664 --> 57:08.942
You know, little weed station.

57:08.942 --> 57:10.254
All right, break time.

57:10.254 --> 57:11.531
Let's go smoke some weed.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.914
- I bet they have the best pot.

57:14.914 --> 57:18.711
- Oh, yes they do, they have to.

57:18.711 --> 57:19.539
- Yeah.

57:19.539 --> 57:20.575
- Let's go.

57:20.575 --> 57:21.438
- We gotta go.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.266
- Now.

57:22.266 --> 57:23.094
- To the North Pole.

57:23.094 --> 57:23.923
- Right now?

57:23.923 --> 57:24.855
- Yeah.

57:24.855 --> 57:26.028
- Is it North or South Pole?

57:26.028 --> 57:27.271
- It's North, it's
definitely North, yeah.

57:27.271 --> 57:27.927
- But who lives
in the South Pole?

57:27.927 --> 57:29.204
- Anti-Santa.

57:29.204 --> 57:30.447
- Anti-Santa, oh,
fucking anti-guy.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.724
- He gives you coal.

57:31.724 --> 57:33.588
- Bleck, I hate coal.

57:33.588 --> 57:35.935
- I know, he's a jerk.

57:35.935 --> 57:36.798
- He's stupid.

57:40.698 --> 57:42.700
- Well, I'm gonna head back in.

57:46.186 --> 57:48.844
- Wait, wait.

57:52.952 --> 57:55.679
Look, I just wanna
say I'm sorry.

57:58.509 --> 58:01.167
You know, I, I like
what we have right now.

58:02.755 --> 58:06.068
Just being really good friends.

58:11.142 --> 58:13.904
- Oh Jake, every
guy that I date,

58:15.215 --> 58:16.458
I compare them to you.

58:17.563 --> 58:19.254
I don't think I can
be just friends.

58:53.840 --> 58:58.535
- Hell yeah, see, that is
what I'm talking about.

58:59.984 --> 59:02.435
We might as well make the
best out of this situation.

59:04.402 --> 59:06.543
- You know what, I agree.

59:07.613 --> 59:09.960
This is our party.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.513
We should be letting loose.

59:11.513 --> 59:13.895
Have some fun before we
all go home for break, yes.

59:13.895 --> 59:18.865
So, Merry Christmas and
have a great New Year

59:18.865 --> 59:20.177
for the Delta Sigma Sigma's.

59:20.177 --> 59:22.904
- And here's to Sophie
being okay, yeah.

59:32.845 --> 59:37.850
- Okay, I got it, tell
me your worst Christmas.

59:38.713 --> 59:40.818
- Ooh, this could be good.

59:40.818 --> 59:44.615
- Wait, like bad,
bad, or funny bad?

59:44.615 --> 59:46.237
- Whichever you
wanna share, bro.

59:46.237 --> 59:49.447
- Okay, now, I got one.

59:49.447 --> 59:51.657
Um, do you remember
that incident

59:51.657 --> 59:54.660
that happened with great-grandpa
a couple of years back?

59:54.660 --> 59:56.972
- Oh gross, don't even.

59:56.972 --> 59:58.560
- Well, now we have to know.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.803
- Yeah, spill it, dude.

59:59.803 --> 01:00:01.252
- All right, all
right, all right.

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:05.498
Um, it had to be about
what, five Christmas's ago?

01:00:05.498 --> 01:00:07.500
Yeah, yeah, because
it was the first time

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.572
the whole family had gotten
together in a really long time,

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:13.437
and that included
my great-grandpa,

01:00:13.437 --> 01:00:17.268
who was about a
hundred years old.

01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:20.582
Horrible health, but my
dad insisted he come.

01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:25.552
So, so, my mom prepares
this crazy Christmas dinner.

01:00:25.552 --> 01:00:30.040
You know, like ham, pot
roast, tons of side dishes.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.594
Honestly, it looked
and smelled delicious.

01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:35.977
We unwrapped the gifts,
gather around the table,

01:00:35.977 --> 01:00:39.152
my grandma wheels in
my great-grandpa and--

01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:41.499
- Wheels in?

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:45.918
- Yes, and just as
we're being served,

01:00:45.918 --> 01:00:50.232
there is a long, wet,
splattering sound.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:54.892
Whole room fills with this
horrible scent.

01:00:56.963 --> 01:01:01.209
It turned out my
great-grandpa had diarrhea.

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:04.833
Not just normal diarrhea,
really, really bad diarrhea.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:07.077
Yo, I can't even
describe the smell.

01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:10.114
It goes down his pants,
all over the floor.

01:01:11.322 --> 01:01:13.117
Needless to say my
appetite was gone.

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:16.396
- Dude, that's
fucking disgusting.

01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:19.192
- You are so wrong
for sharing that.

01:01:19.192 --> 01:01:20.400
He was old and sick.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.643
He couldn't help it.

01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:23.749
- I mean, he asked about
our worst Christmas.

01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:25.612
You were there,
it was pretty bad.

01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:28.063
- Poor guy, I feel
sorry for him.

01:01:28.063 --> 01:01:31.826
- Yeah, I mean, he did
die like a week later, so.

01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:35.346
- Luckily, all my Christmas's
have been pretty good.

01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:37.624
- So, anyone else?

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.629
How about you, Danielle, shit.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:46.461
- My answer that obvious?

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:51.466
Oh my God, seriously.

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:54.296
You guys, it's okay, all right.

01:01:56.022 --> 01:01:57.783
All right, you wanna
know the truth?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:04.065
I was upset at my
sister's death, obviously,

01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:08.759
but at the time I was more upset

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:10.243
that my Christmas was ruined.

01:02:11.969 --> 01:02:15.214
You know, that year I
didn't get my presents.

01:02:15.214 --> 01:02:18.873
Instead of seeing Santa
and the Christmas lights,

01:02:18.873 --> 01:02:23.084
I went to a visitation
and a funeral.

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:31.057
Instead of mourning
her I was angry at her.

01:02:35.855 --> 01:02:38.858
You know, I guess that's
why I pledged here.

01:02:38.858 --> 01:02:39.756
It was guilt.

01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:44.519
Like I felt like I deserved

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.247
to be haunted by
what happened to her.

01:02:48.247 --> 01:02:51.560
- Shit, Danielle, you had to
be like what, eight years old?

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.631
You were just a little kid.

01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:56.462
There's no way you had
any type of knowing

01:02:56.462 --> 01:02:58.291
of what was going on.

01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:00.777
I mean, I'm pretty sure you
responded pretty normal.

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.125
- I mean, kids
are selfish, Dani.

01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:05.298
That's just their nature.

01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:06.852
- Fuck, I would've been pissed

01:03:06.852 --> 01:03:09.475
not to receive any Christmas
presents if I was eight.

01:03:09.475 --> 01:03:10.303
- Really, Grant?

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:12.236
All right, you know what?

01:03:12.236 --> 01:03:13.479
You were a kid.

01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:15.584
Your reaction was
totally natural.

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:17.483
What matters is that
you miss her now.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:23.800
- Yeah, shit,
I'm sorry.

01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:26.216
I didn't mean for
this to turn into

01:03:26.216 --> 01:03:28.321
some like therapy
session or whatever.

01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:32.809
Please, let the festivities
continue, huh, go on.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.535
- Ooh, okay, new topic.

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:40.264
Who's had sex on Christmas Day?

01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:45.545
Masturbating?

01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:48.652
- On that note, I'm gonna
go hang out with Tyler.

01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:50.205
- I thought he left already?

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:52.829
- Apparently not,
catch you later, guys.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.384
- Goodnight.

01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:58.662
- Yo, speaking of that, Jake
and Alexandria headed home?

01:03:58.662 --> 01:03:59.456
- Yeah, I guess.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.667
Look anyway, how about some uh,

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:06.014
better music and
we have some fun.

01:04:07.153 --> 01:04:09.949
Play some games, some cards,

01:04:09.949 --> 01:04:12.710
beer pong,
naked Twister.

01:04:14.126 --> 01:04:18.371
- Fine, I know how
to be a good hostess.

01:04:24.136 --> 01:04:27.242
- Hell, yeah, woo!

01:04:28.174 --> 01:04:29.417
- Oh, okay, yeah.

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:32.869
- Oh my God, oh my
God, nope, nope.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.905
I'm sorry, but nope.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:37.425
Grant, come on,
sit down, sit down.

01:04:37.425 --> 01:04:41.118
It's over, it is over, yup.

01:04:42.533 --> 01:04:46.330
My sister and my girlfriend
and me, whole show.

01:04:53.337 --> 01:04:57.928
- Tyler, are you out here?

01:06:09.275 --> 01:06:13.659
- All right, so, what
should we do now?

01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:17.283
- Ah, maybe something
a little low-key.

01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.354
I may or may not be
feeling this alcohol.

01:06:21.149 --> 01:06:23.600
- Okay, um, a movie?

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.981
- Yeah.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.465
- Whatchu got?

01:06:26.465 --> 01:06:29.192
- I know Madison has a
bunch of Christmas movies.

01:06:29.192 --> 01:06:33.713
We have Elf, A Christmas Story,
Christmas Vacation, Prancer?

01:06:35.267 --> 01:06:37.786
- Hell no, those fucking suck,

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.824
except for Christmas Vacation.

01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:42.895
- All right, so
what do you suggest?

01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:48.866
- Have you guys seen
Silent Night, Deadly Night?

01:06:48.866 --> 01:06:50.006
- Mm mm.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.283
- About the killer Santa

01:06:51.283 --> 01:06:53.561
who hacks the shit out
of the naughty peeps.

01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:57.841
- Wow, how very um,
festive sounding.

01:06:57.841 --> 01:06:59.877
- Hey,
where's Madison anyway?

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:02.156
- I don't know.

01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:09.128
Did you hear that?

01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:11.475
- Yeah.

01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:17.895
- What the heck?

01:07:26.904 --> 01:07:30.115
Hey guys, come take
a look at this.

01:07:35.189 --> 01:07:36.742
- Is that Madison's phone?

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:37.674
- Mm hmm.

01:07:38.537 --> 01:07:39.469
- Why is it here?

01:07:39.469 --> 01:07:40.918
That doesn't make any sense.

01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:43.231
- I know, right, she
never leaves without it.

01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:46.096
- Okay, well, maybe she
doesn't know that it's missing.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:47.304
She could've dropped it.

01:07:47.304 --> 01:07:48.892
- Kyle, you don't understand.

01:07:48.892 --> 01:07:51.826
Here phone is like
her fifth appendage.

01:07:51.826 --> 01:07:53.034
She never leaves without it.

01:07:53.034 --> 01:07:54.967
- Yeah, well, she
wouldn't have left it

01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:56.658
in the first place, so.

01:07:56.658 --> 01:07:58.971
- Just call or text her, guys.

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:00.248
It's not that serious.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.253
Right, right.

01:08:05.253 --> 01:08:06.358
- Okay, you know what?

01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:07.462
Maybe, maybe she's still here.

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:08.636
She could be upstairs sleeping.

01:08:08.636 --> 01:08:10.155
- Uh, I don't know.

01:08:11.328 --> 01:08:12.812
- I mean, we could
at least check.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.095
- And on that note,
I'm heading out.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.993
I'm not sticking around for
more missing girl drama.

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:24.997
- Yeah, whatever, man.

01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:27.930
Just get Jake and
Alexandria before you go.

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.348
- Uh, dude, I ain't
their dad, later.

01:08:33.937 --> 01:08:35.283
- Hey, I'm gonna go check
for Madison upstairs.

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:36.215
- Okay, I'll come.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.390
- Shit!

01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:41.358
- Heading out Mr. Mosley?

01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:44.361
- Uh yeah, I was heading
back to my place.

01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:46.707
That's all right, isn't it?

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:48.607
I'm not under
arrest or anything?

01:08:48.607 --> 01:08:50.332
- Of course not.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:51.712
- Any word from Sophie?

01:08:51.712 --> 01:08:54.026
- Unfortunately, no, her parents

01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:56.372
are understandably worried sick,

01:08:56.372 --> 01:08:57.995
and by my estimation,

01:08:57.995 --> 01:09:00.343
she's been missing
for over 24 hours,

01:09:00.343 --> 01:09:01.689
so it's out of my hands now,

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:03.725
and in the hands of
the county police.

01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:05.693
- I just don't know
where she could be.

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:09.075
- You can go home, Grant,

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:10.456
but I'll take you.

01:09:10.456 --> 01:09:12.319
Why don't you go have a
seat in the patrol car?

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.321
I'll be out shortly.

01:09:15.116 --> 01:09:18.361
- Okay, can I sit
upfront though,

01:09:18.361 --> 01:09:20.535
since I'm not under
arrest or anything?

01:09:21.984 --> 01:09:25.506
I just don't people seeing me
in the back of a patrol car.

01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:29.268
- Sure, I was actually going
to suggest the same thing.

01:09:29.268 --> 01:09:32.202
- Coolness, I'll
see you fools later.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:34.997
- Merry Christmas, Grant.

01:09:34.997 --> 01:09:37.897
- Oh, and Mr. Mosley,
don't touch anything.

01:09:43.455 --> 01:09:45.560
- Hey, he's gonna
be okay, right?

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.598
You don't actually think he
did anything to Sophie, do you?

01:09:48.598 --> 01:09:50.703
- Where are the other kids
who were here earlier?

01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:54.845
- Um, Monica and Tyler
should be out back.

01:09:54.845 --> 01:09:57.193
I'm not sure where
Jake and Alex are.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:10:00.196
- You mind if I go out back to
have a quick chat with them?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.818
- No, no, not at all.

01:10:01.818 --> 01:10:04.303
- Just point me the
way to the backdoor.

01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:05.304
- All right.

01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:12.415
You guys, think we should tell
her about Madison's phone?

01:10:12.415 --> 01:10:15.659
- No, not until we know
she's definitely not here.

01:10:17.627 --> 01:10:19.767
Listen, me and Danielle
will go upstairs.

01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:22.597
You stay here, you wait
for Cornell and the others.

01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:24.944
- Okay, but please, hurry back.

01:10:24.944 --> 01:10:26.118
I'm starting to get

01:10:26.118 --> 01:10:27.809
a really uneasy feeling
about all of this.

01:10:27.809 --> 01:10:28.638
- Hey, let's go.

01:10:40.477 --> 01:10:43.411
- Any sexy ladies out there?

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.206
I need some pussy.

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:46.345
Over and out.

01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:48.658
Fucking sluts.

01:10:49.728 --> 01:10:50.867
- Cornell?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.814
- Who the hell are you?

01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:11.301
And what's with that
creepy fucking mask, dude?

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.992
This is Christmas,
not Halloween.

01:11:54.033 --> 01:11:56.001
- Madison, you in there?

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:02.973
I knew she wasn't here, Kyle.

01:12:02.973 --> 01:12:03.802
This is strange.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:40.148
- Students, it's campus Officer
Cornell, please respond.

01:13:19.636 --> 01:13:23.122
Officer Cornell
here, I'm coming in.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.073
- This is just, I don't
know where she could be.

01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.455
- Look, something
could've come up,

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:47.181
an emergency, I don't know.

01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:48.182
- And Sophie?

01:13:49.355 --> 01:13:50.840
- I wish I knew, Danielle.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.256
Let's just go back
downstairs with Kayla, okay?

01:13:54.913 --> 01:13:55.741
- Okay.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.814
- Come on.

01:13:59.814 --> 01:14:00.643
- Mm, wait.

01:14:26.013 --> 01:14:30.500
- You guys,
what're you doing?

01:14:32.675 --> 01:14:35.678
Kyle, Danielle!

01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:40.027
- We'll be there
in a second, okay, just wait.

01:14:41.062 --> 01:14:41.891
- Okay.

01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:57.147
This is pretty tacky.

01:15:04.914 --> 01:15:06.502
Where's the topper?

01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:46.438
- I mean, who would send that?

01:15:46.438 --> 01:15:47.715
It's definitely not Monica.

01:15:47.715 --> 01:15:49.855
- It's just a sick joke, okay.

01:15:49.855 --> 01:15:50.822
They're super drunk.

01:15:50.822 --> 01:15:52.064
They probably think it's funny.

01:15:52.064 --> 01:15:53.549
- I really don't think that--

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.275
- We will go find them
and we'll give them hell.

01:15:58.726 --> 01:15:59.555
- Okay.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.666
- Kayla, where is she?

01:16:07.666 --> 01:16:10.255
- I don't like this, Kyle.

01:16:10.255 --> 01:16:11.497
Something isn't right.

01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:14.570
- Listen, she might be
outside with Cornell.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.743
- I don't know.

01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:16.572
I mean, I, we said we'd
be down in a minute.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.883
You heard me, right?

01:16:19.298 --> 01:16:21.093
- Okay, well, what do
you want to do, Danielle?

01:16:23.786 --> 01:16:25.063
- I don't know.

01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:26.892
I guess we can just
go outside and look.

01:16:26.892 --> 01:16:28.618
- Okay, I think you're
letting your imagination

01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:29.861
get the best of you.

01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:33.692
All right, everything
is fine, I promise.

01:16:33.692 --> 01:16:36.453
- Okay, well, let's go.

01:16:41.217 --> 01:16:42.045
- Hello?

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:45.739
Something isn't right.

01:16:45.739 --> 01:16:47.568
We should just leave.

01:16:47.568 --> 01:16:48.776
- Calm down, Danielle,
it's probably just--

01:16:48.776 --> 01:16:50.985
- They wouldn't all
just leave, Kyle!

01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:55.438
- Okay, okay, Danielle,
no, you're right.

01:16:55.438 --> 01:16:56.819
This does feel a little strange,

01:16:56.819 --> 01:16:58.441
which is why we are
gonna go inside,

01:16:58.441 --> 01:16:59.373
and we're gonna call the--

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.893
- No, please, let's just go.

01:17:01.893 --> 01:17:02.928
This just isn't--

01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:09.521
- You see, it's
a joke, Danielle.

01:17:09.521 --> 01:17:10.626
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.489
You know how Jake and Grant are.

01:17:12.489 --> 01:17:13.836
How convincing they can be.

01:17:15.285 --> 01:17:16.183
They're probably inside
laughing at us right now.

01:17:16.183 --> 01:17:17.529
We gotta go stop them.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.496
- Okay.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.780
- Jesus Christ, guys,
quit fucking around.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.609
- Can we please just
go, this isn't--

01:17:31.992 --> 01:17:34.546
- All right, and now I'm
getting fucking pissed, come on.

01:17:34.546 --> 01:17:35.581
- No, wait.

01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:50.355
- Fuck!

01:17:53.945 --> 01:17:54.773
Hey, don't look,
don't look, okay.

01:17:54.773 --> 01:17:56.430
Just look at me.

01:17:57.914 --> 01:17:59.398
If we're gonna get outta
her, we have to stay calm.

01:17:59.398 --> 01:18:00.710
- Okay, okay.

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.678
- Just take deep
breaths, deep breaths.

01:18:04.265 --> 01:18:05.439
I would never let anything

01:18:05.439 --> 01:18:06.785
happen to you,
Danielle, I promise.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:15.138
You bitch!

01:18:16.899 --> 01:18:20.247
You little bitch,
crying and whimpering,

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.561
when you're the reason this
happened in the first place.

01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:27.875
Coming here, flaunting
what your sister did!

01:18:29.566 --> 01:18:31.085
- What the, what the fuck?

01:18:32.052 --> 01:18:34.433
- Why, why would do this?

01:18:34.433 --> 01:18:37.747
- Because your sister
killed my baby,

01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:43.270
and this sorority allowed it!

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:44.720
They encouraged it!

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.620
- Your psycho fucking
daughter killed my sister!

01:18:50.035 --> 01:18:53.383
- Oh, you cunt, you
see you little cunt.

01:18:54.557 --> 01:18:59.320
This is why you,
they have to die,

01:19:01.219 --> 01:19:06.224
so you can feel the loss
and pain that I have!

01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:14.439
And you're gonna feel some
pain and some loss, trust me!

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.548
- Stop, lower your weapon now.

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:23.517
I'm calling 9-1-1.

01:19:27.624 --> 01:19:28.833
Yes, we need services

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:32.043
to the Delta Sigma Sigma
sorority house ASAP.

01:19:32.043 --> 01:19:33.803
There's been a
multiple homicide.

01:19:39.084 --> 01:19:44.055
- Oh, you think this is over.

01:19:44.055 --> 01:19:45.297
Well, it's just started!

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:54.168
- Oh, why, why?

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:01.313
- Merry Christmas, Danielle,
from our family to yours.

01:20:01.313 --> 01:20:04.972
- Nothing like the
bond between sisters.

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:07.354
Am I right, Danielle?

01:20:07.354 --> 01:20:09.114
- You two are sick!

01:20:09.114 --> 01:20:12.393
- Oh no, I'm actually very sane.

01:20:12.393 --> 01:20:13.670
I'm giving my sister

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:16.294
the greatest gift she
can receive, revenge.

01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:18.365
- Mm hmm.

01:20:18.365 --> 01:20:21.057
- Before making her
pain go away for good.

01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:17.838
I see you recognize the room.

01:21:18.804 --> 01:21:21.635
Fitting eh, but it ends for you

01:21:21.635 --> 01:21:25.052
the same place it ended
for your bitch of a sister!

01:21:26.226 --> 01:21:30.126
And ultimately, my
sweet, sweet niece.

01:21:30.126 --> 01:21:32.370
- I'm sorry.

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:34.475
- It's too late to
be sorry, Danielle.

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:38.445
You should've been sorry
before you came to this campus

01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:40.550
and pledged this house.

01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:42.449
What did you expect?

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:49.249
You have no idea how
what your sister did

01:21:49.249 --> 01:21:51.458
affected my sister,

01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:53.356
the hate that consumed her life.

01:21:56.256 --> 01:21:59.811
Even after this, she
wouldn't have been healed.

01:21:59.811 --> 01:22:01.606
I had to put her
out of her misery.

01:22:03.056 --> 01:22:05.472
Put this house
out of its misery.

01:22:07.163 --> 01:22:09.855
This isn't going to be quick,

01:22:10.822 --> 01:22:13.549
and it will be painful.

01:23:14.196 --> 01:23:15.956
- Well, thank you for
the lovely meal, sir.

01:23:15.956 --> 01:23:17.440
- Sure wish you'd stay over.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.823
- Yeah, I know, but I gotta
go get some work done,

01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:23.343
if there's any chance
of me getting away, so.

01:23:23.343 --> 01:23:27.002
- Fair enough, sure your
okay with Christmas in Vegas?

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.348
- Yeah, of course.

01:23:28.348 --> 01:23:29.590
It'll be fun.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.387
- Okay, good, because I
can not think of anywhere

01:23:33.387 --> 01:23:35.734
less Christmasy than Las Vegas.

01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:37.598
- Yeah, I guess we both have

01:23:37.598 --> 01:23:39.635
legitimate reasons to
hate Christmas now.

01:23:40.705 --> 01:23:42.051
- Okay, why don't you head out.

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:43.639
Get your work done, get packed.

01:23:43.639 --> 01:23:44.467
- Yeah, okay.

01:23:45.917 --> 01:23:47.470
- Hey.

01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:50.197
- Hey.

01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.234
- Everything's okay.

01:23:53.545 --> 01:23:55.478
- Yeah, adios, lover boy.

01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:34.637
- Did you really have
to get the car so bloody?

01:26:35.305 --> 01:26:41.711
