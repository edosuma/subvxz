01:08.491 --> 01:10.161
This time I have it, Krang,

01:10.162 --> 01:11.830
A scheme that will finally rid us

01:11.831 --> 01:14.903
of those blasted turtles
once and for all.

01:14.904 --> 01:17.441
Yeah. Right.

01:17.442 --> 01:20.914
And just how do you
propose doing this ?

01:20.915 --> 01:23.753
Simple. The police
are understaffed.

01:23.754 --> 01:27.593
Even now they are working on a
plan to build a robot police force.

01:27.594 --> 01:30.699
And what has that
to do with you ?

01:30.700 --> 01:32.370
I will steal the robot,

01:32.371 --> 01:34.373
program it to obey only me,

01:34.374 --> 01:38.614
then create an army of clones
with which to destroy the turtles.

01:38.615 --> 01:42.722
All right. But remember,
if you fail,

01:42.723 --> 01:46.630
you shall spend the rest of your
miserable existence

01:46.631 --> 01:49.168
with these two dolts.

01:49.169 --> 01:52.574
Yeah. With us.

01:52.575 --> 01:55.647
Have no fear.
I will not fail.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.150
Cheer up, Irma.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.788
There are thousands of nice guys
in the city.

01:59.789 --> 02:02.827
Oh, yeah ? So how come
I can't meet one ?

02:02.828 --> 02:05.533
You will, Irma.
Just be patient.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.601
Hey, baby.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.972
What's shaking, sweet thing ?

02:08.973 --> 02:11.711
April, you were right.

02:11.712 --> 02:14.249
My patience finally paid off.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.752
Forget it, Irma.

02:15.753 --> 02:17.188
Just keep waiting.

02:19.626 --> 02:21.129
That's strange.

02:21.130 --> 02:22.798
The door was unlocked.

02:22.799 --> 02:25.471
No wonder. I'm being robbed !

02:25.472 --> 02:27.273
Hiya, ladies.

02:27.274 --> 02:29.812
You drop that couch this instant.

02:29.813 --> 02:31.315
Good idea, doll.

02:31.316 --> 02:33.686
Saves me taking the stairs.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.892
Stop that ! You can't take my things.

02:38.362 --> 02:40.900
Oh, the nerve of those creeps !

02:40.901 --> 02:42.069
They wouldn't get away with this

02:42.070 --> 02:43.304
if the turtles were here.

02:43.305 --> 02:45.675
Most people would want
the boys in blue.

02:45.676 --> 02:47.446
She wants the boys in green.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.917
Steady, Donatello.

02:49.918 --> 02:52.923
Do not lose your concentration.

02:52.924 --> 02:55.594
I'm trying, Splinter.

02:55.595 --> 02:57.698
Hold steady, dudes.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.203
It's just about screwed in.

03:00.204 --> 03:02.474
Wha--hang on !

03:03.744 --> 03:06.215
I hope we're not being graded
on this.

03:06.216 --> 03:09.387
All things in life
are subject to examination,

03:09.388 --> 03:10.790
my young friends.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.892
Come in, guys.

03:11.893 --> 03:13.295
It's an emergency.

03:13.296 --> 03:14.564
What's wrong, April ?

03:14.565 --> 03:17.336
My apartment has just
been burglarized.

03:17.337 --> 03:18.772
They took everything.

03:18.773 --> 03:21.009
What a bummer, man.

03:21.010 --> 03:23.882
Hold on, April.
We'll be right there.

03:25.319 --> 03:26.487
Turtles.

03:26.488 --> 03:28.457
What about the light bulb ?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.126
Oh, yeah. Right.

03:35.004 --> 03:38.610
Hey, dynamite catch.

03:38.611 --> 03:41.481
I am so angry, Irma.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.420
This city is overrun
with thieves and hoodlums.

03:44.421 --> 03:46.925
Gosh, April, don't just bite it.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.629
Fight it.

03:48.630 --> 03:49.964
What do you mean ?

03:49.965 --> 03:54.439
Well, do a story on it
for channel 6 news.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.979
Irma, you're right.
I will.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.181
Who are you calling ?

03:59.182 --> 04:01.520
My contact at police headquarters.

04:01.521 --> 04:02.656
He owes me one.

04:03.926 --> 04:05.694
Ok, fellas.

04:05.695 --> 04:07.364
Keep your eyes open now.

04:07.365 --> 04:08.867
Oh, wow, dudes.

04:08.868 --> 04:10.537
Scope that out.

04:10.538 --> 04:13.542
That's the same van April described.

04:13.543 --> 04:17.517
Step right up, guys,
for some really hot buys.

04:17.517 --> 04:21.057
Yeah, you want to buy this TV
that we just picked up ?

04:21.058 --> 04:23.161
It's a real steal.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.371
Hey, I recognize that.
It's April's.

04:28.372 --> 04:30.408
In fact, all of this stuff's

04:30.409 --> 04:32.779
been stolen from April's apartment.

04:32.780 --> 04:35.217
Ok, bozos, hand it over.

04:35.218 --> 04:38.223
I guess these clowns are looking
for trouble, huh ?

04:38.224 --> 04:41.429
Ok, wimps.
Let's rumble.

04:41.430 --> 04:44.067
Ready for a little workout, guys ?

04:44.068 --> 04:47.073
Radical notion, dude.

04:47.074 --> 04:48.576
Turtle costumes ?

04:48.577 --> 04:52.082
Oh, that's real scary, ain't it ?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.488
Oh, yeah. Real scary.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.764
Hey, it worked before.

04:59.765 --> 05:02.436
Why not a second time ?

05:04.306 --> 05:06.443
1, 2, 3...

05:06.444 --> 05:07.512
Lift !

05:09.316 --> 05:10.685
Things are looking up.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.957
Yeah. Now that is scary.

05:16.296 --> 05:19.969
You see, there are ways of settling
disputes without violence.

05:19.970 --> 05:21.372
I'm glad it worked.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.776
Couldn't hold this thing
up another 10 minutes.

05:23.777 --> 05:26.314
Ok, i've got the address.
Thanks.

05:27.317 --> 05:30.189
Special delivery for April O'Neill.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.693
Here, April. We brought
all your things back

05:32.694 --> 05:34.330
exactly as promised.

05:34.331 --> 05:36.534
But they're all ruined !

05:36.535 --> 05:38.037
Don't sweat it.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.610
I have them fixed in one minute.

05:44.751 --> 05:47.221
Better make that a few minutes.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.824
Listen, guys, I've got to run.

05:48.825 --> 05:50.694
I'm onto an important story,

05:50.695 --> 05:53.833
but i do appreciate all your help.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.704
This is the place.

05:55.705 --> 05:56.873
My contact said they're building

05:56.874 --> 05:59.712
a secret experimental robot cop here.

05:59.713 --> 06:03.185
That could be the answer to this
whole crime in the streets problem.

06:04.655 --> 06:05.990
Someone's coming.

06:11.067 --> 06:14.606
This place is right out of a
monster movie

06:14.607 --> 06:16.610
complete with Frankenstein.

06:16.611 --> 06:19.215
I sure hope not.

06:19.216 --> 06:20.618
"Rex-1" ?

06:20.619 --> 06:22.221
A robot cop.

06:22.222 --> 06:24.525
This must be the gadget
that controls it.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.230
It works.

06:27.231 --> 06:29.167
What a scoop this will be.

06:29.168 --> 06:30.971
<I>I am Rex-1.

06:30.972 --> 06:34.411
<I>I am programmed to
<I>serve and protect you.

06:34.412 --> 06:37.617
Nice to meet you.
I'm April.

06:37.618 --> 06:39.253
Now say cheese.

06:39.254 --> 06:41.023
<I>Cheese does not compute.

06:41.024 --> 06:43.328
<I>I would rather ingest an oil shake.

06:43.329 --> 06:45.532
The security guards.

06:45.533 --> 06:46.534
<I>Are you in danger ?

06:46.535 --> 06:48.738
Just stay still and hold your tongue.

06:50.075 --> 06:51.677
<I>Whatever you say.

06:55.352 --> 06:57.355
All right, who's in there ?

07:00.562 --> 07:02.698
Don't move.
You're under arrest.

07:02.699 --> 07:05.803
But I'm April O'Neill, channel 6 news.

07:05.804 --> 07:07.340
Save it for the police, lady.

07:08.410 --> 07:10.546
<I>The police are already here.

07:10.547 --> 07:12.516
<I>You're charged with
disturbing the peace...

07:12.517 --> 07:14.220
Put us down, you hunk of tin.

07:14.221 --> 07:15.389
<I>Resisting arrest...

07:15.390 --> 07:17.826
You ain't never gettin' away
with this !

07:17.827 --> 07:20.299
<I>...and using a double negative.

07:22.671 --> 07:24.039
I'd better get out of here.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.574
They'll be coming to any minute.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.712
It was nice meeting you, Rex.

07:29.684 --> 07:32.354
<I>Wait, sir. You forgot
an important item.

07:32.355 --> 07:35.393
I was lucky to get out
of there with my skin.

07:35.394 --> 07:36.696
<I>Hello.

07:36.697 --> 07:39.368
You ! Why did you follow me ?

07:39.369 --> 07:40.603
<I>You are my controller.

07:40.604 --> 07:43.208
<I>I serve and protect only you.

07:43.209 --> 07:46.081
That's sweet of you, Rex,
but i'd rather not.

07:46.082 --> 07:48.618
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going home.

07:48.619 --> 07:50.756
<I>Yes, sir. home immediately.

07:50.757 --> 07:53.294
You don't have to carry me.

07:53.295 --> 07:54.964
I can walk, honest.

07:54.965 --> 07:58.270
Heel. Sit.
Down, boy.

07:58.271 --> 08:01.844
Soon, I shall be able to tap into
the city's computers.

08:01.845 --> 08:06.019
And when I do, victory
will be mine.

08:07.455 --> 08:09.792
Can I press some of the buttons ?
CanI ?

08:09.793 --> 08:10.794
Oh, please ! Oh, please !

08:10.795 --> 08:12.130
Pretty please, can I ?

08:12.131 --> 08:15.069
Will you two imbecilic buffoons
stop pestering me !

08:15.070 --> 08:16.973
This is delicate work.

08:16.974 --> 08:20.379
He called us imbecilic buffoons.

08:20.380 --> 08:24.521
Yeah. And you thought
he didn't like us.

08:27.795 --> 08:29.063
<I>Here, sir.

08:29.064 --> 08:30.231
What's that ?

08:30.232 --> 08:31.901
<I>your dinner.
<I>you must ingest

08:31.902 --> 08:33.604
<I>your daily intake
<I>of fuel.

08:33.605 --> 08:36.241
This is very good.

08:36.243 --> 08:38.847
<I>i have been programmed
<I>to cook as well as to fight.

08:38.849 --> 08:42.855
Yoo-hoo, april !
I just wanted--

08:42.856 --> 08:46.996
Oh...oh,
I am so sorry.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.768
I didn't realize
You had company.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.638
Quite a hunk.

08:51.639 --> 08:53.976
Forget it, irma.
He's not human.

08:53.977 --> 08:55.613
Open up, miss o'neill.

08:55.614 --> 08:57.784
We know you and
That robot are in there.

08:57.785 --> 09:00.555
It's those
Security guards,
They've found me.

09:00.556 --> 09:02.726
Yeah, we're gonna
Count to 3 here,

09:02.727 --> 09:04.797
And then we break
Down the door.

09:04.798 --> 09:07.235
1, 2...

09:11.811 --> 09:14.716
...2 1/2, 3 !

09:14.717 --> 09:17.154
Ok, this is it.
Your last chance.

09:17.155 --> 09:18.690
<I>i will answer
<I>the door.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.560
No, no. Don't open
That door.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.697
<I>very well. I will
<I>make a new one.

09:24.169 --> 09:26.972
Never mind.

09:26.973 --> 09:30.445
It sure is nice

09:30.446 --> 09:32.416
To have a man
Around the house.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.187
Oh, i'm sorry, rex,

09:34.188 --> 09:36.824
But you'll just have to
Go back to the lab.

09:36.825 --> 09:40.364
<I>negative. I must remain
<I>with my controller.

09:40.365 --> 09:43.604
And he's
So faithful, too.

09:43.605 --> 09:46.042
Are there any more
Like you down
At the lab ?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.512
Forget it, irma.

09:47.513 --> 09:50.283
I've gotta get him
Out of here.

09:50.284 --> 09:52.387
So, what do you
Think, guys ?

09:52.388 --> 09:54.225
You think i could make it
As a baton twirler ?

09:55.294 --> 09:58.700
Hey, fella,
That was my best bow.

10:00.036 --> 10:01.772
<I>being a 7-foot robot

10:01.773 --> 10:03.910
<I>means never having
<I>to say you're sorry.

10:03.911 --> 10:05.212
I'll handle this.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.719
Put him down, you
Oversized tin can.

10:10.022 --> 10:13.527
Cut it out,
Leonardo.

10:13.528 --> 10:15.865
It's ok, rex.
They're friends.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.402
<I>if they are
<I>your friends,

10:17.403 --> 10:19.238
<I>they are my friends.

10:20.643 --> 10:22.278
I'd hate to see how
He treats an enemy.

10:22.279 --> 10:24.482
Hey, what's
The scoop, april ?

10:24.483 --> 10:26.819
Who is this
Chrome-plated dude ?

10:26.820 --> 10:28.423
His name is rex-1.

10:28.424 --> 10:30.494
He's an experimental
Police robot.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.330
He followed me home
From the lab.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.002
Sounds like
He's got a crush on you.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.073
I was only trying
To get a story.

10:37.074 --> 10:38.809
Now the police think
I stole him.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.180
How can we be
Of assistance ?

10:41.181 --> 10:43.752
Well, there <I>is
Something you can do.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.530
Ok, fellas.
Let's go for it.

10:49.531 --> 10:54.439
Excuse me, but wouldn't
The elevator be
A whole lot easier ?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.609
Vernon, where the devil
Is april ?

10:56.610 --> 10:58.480
I don't know,
Mr. Thompson.

10:58.481 --> 11:00.384
I haven't seen her
All day.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.822
Well, find her,
Blast it !

11:04.827 --> 11:07.230
What's going on ?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.733
Don't panic, fella.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.338
Yeah,
And no fair peeking.

11:11.339 --> 11:13.642
We're taking you
To see april.

11:13.643 --> 11:15.379
Are you ready, vernon ?

11:15.380 --> 11:16.749
I'm not sure.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.620
I've never done this
Wearing a blindfold
Before.

11:19.621 --> 11:20.922
Hey, man, come on.

11:20.923 --> 11:24.530
Like you gotta open yourself
Up to new experiences. Ok ?

11:24.531 --> 11:26.032
No, no, vernon.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.537
Point it
In this direction.

11:28.538 --> 11:30.541
Oh, this
Is impossible.

11:30.542 --> 11:32.745
I'm a sensitive artist.

11:32.746 --> 11:35.150
Never mind, vernon.
I'll help you.

11:35.151 --> 11:39.091
Oh, wow.
Is this ever cool.

11:39.092 --> 11:40.894
Hey, guys, do something.

11:40.895 --> 11:42.330
Duh, how's this ?

11:42.331 --> 11:44.267
Look at me, ma !

11:44.268 --> 11:46.104
I'm dancing.
I'm dancing.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.072
Do you mind, fellas ?

11:47.073 --> 11:49.510
I'd like to get my scoop
Into channel 6

11:49.511 --> 11:50.612
This decade.

11:50.613 --> 11:51.681
Oh, sure, april.

11:51.682 --> 11:53.852
Channel 6
Is standing by.

11:53.853 --> 11:56.457
Ok, april.
You're on.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.860
This is april o'neill,

11:57.861 --> 12:00.298
Coming to you live
From a secret location.

12:00.299 --> 12:03.237
Secret location !
What is going on
Here ?

12:03.238 --> 12:06.810
I'm here with an amazing
Robot known as rex-1,

12:06.811 --> 12:09.816
Which stands for
Robot enforcement experiment.

12:09.817 --> 12:13.690
I'm told the city plans
To put these robots
Into mass production.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.965
The plan is to use these
To replace the city's
Human poli

12:19.435 --> 12:21.771
A most interesting concept.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.775
Will this plan work ?

12:23.776 --> 12:27.617
And will this be the end
Of the annual police
Softball games ?

12:27.618 --> 12:28.886
Only time will tell.

12:31.491 --> 12:35.398
Soon i shall answer
All their questions.

12:35.399 --> 12:38.236
Now that i've tapped
Into the city's computers,

12:38.237 --> 12:41.543
I shall have the plans
For the rex prototype.

12:41.544 --> 12:43.313
And with this duplicating
Equipment,

12:43.314 --> 12:46.686
I'll soon have my own army
Of obedient robots

12:46.687 --> 12:48.823
To do my bidding.

12:49.893 --> 12:51.963
Ok, april,
That's a wrap.

12:51.964 --> 12:54.234
Hey, that means you,
Too, vernon.

12:54.235 --> 12:56.471
Time to boogie
On home, bud.

12:56.472 --> 12:59.844
This time let's take
The elevator, please.

13:03.052 --> 13:06.424
This is phase one
Of my plan.

13:06.425 --> 13:08.260
And these 4 most
Wanted criminals

13:08.261 --> 13:10.130
Are your prime target.

13:10.131 --> 13:12.568
Your job--
To destroy them.

13:15.342 --> 13:16.843
Mission accomplished.

13:16.844 --> 13:18.245
Now that we've
Returned vernon,

13:18.246 --> 13:19.849
It's back to the sewers.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.352
Oh, for sure.

13:21.353 --> 13:24.524
Being out in public
Stresses me out totally.

13:24.525 --> 13:26.528
Trouble up ahead.

13:26.529 --> 13:28.031
Look what's headed
This way.

13:28.032 --> 13:30.536
They look like
Cousins of rex-1.

13:30.537 --> 13:33.308
I wish they were
Distant cousins.

13:33.309 --> 13:35.912
You are
Most wanted criminals.

13:35.913 --> 13:38.151
And i always thought
It would be nice
To be wanted.

13:38.152 --> 13:39.987
They outnumber us 3 to 1.

13:39.988 --> 13:41.891
There's no way
We can fight them.

13:41.892 --> 13:45.665
What would
Master splinter do
In a case like this ?

13:45.666 --> 13:48.069
Oh, i'm hoping
He'd split.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.572
In this situation,

13:49.573 --> 13:52.144
That would seem like
The best strategy.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.248
Cancel that maneuver.

13:55.886 --> 13:57.187
Whatever happens,

13:57.188 --> 13:58.890
We'll go down
Fighting bravely

13:58.891 --> 14:01.194
Just like
True ninja turtles.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.579
<I>drop your weapons.
<I>you are under arrest

14:10.580 --> 14:12.248
<I>in the name of the
<I>emperor shredder.

14:12.249 --> 14:15.088
Shredder.
I should have known.

14:15.089 --> 14:17.859
<I>i repeat.
<I>drop your weapons.

14:20.432 --> 14:23.269
Forget it ! We'd rather
Drop our bodies.

14:23.270 --> 14:25.908
Turtle power !

14:27.612 --> 14:29.181
<I>emperor shredder,

14:29.182 --> 14:31.853
<I>there is no sign
<I>of the 4 turtle criminals.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.255
Excellent, excellent.

14:33.256 --> 14:36.228
The turtles
Are gone at last.

14:36.229 --> 14:39.100
Emperor shredder
To all robot enforcers.

14:39.101 --> 14:41.103
Proceed to phase two.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.995
What ? Who in blazes
Are you ?

14:53.996 --> 14:56.566
<I>we are the new law
<I>enforcement troops.

14:59.106 --> 15:02.945
That's strange.
Why did channel 6
Suddenly go off the air ?

15:02.946 --> 15:04.916
And where are the turtles ?

15:04.917 --> 15:06.653
I have tried
Summoning them.

15:06.654 --> 15:08.088
But they do not
Answer.

15:08.089 --> 15:11.929
Splinter, i have a really
Bad feeling about this.

15:11.930 --> 15:14.200
There is a time
For feeling,

15:14.201 --> 15:15.770
And a time
For action.

15:15.771 --> 15:17.272
Come with me.

15:20.012 --> 15:22.482
All right !
Luckily, those robots

15:22.483 --> 15:24.653
Didn't realize
We're amphibians.

15:24.654 --> 15:27.124
Sure. Water is
Our natural habitat.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.197
Yeah, it's
Also the stuff
We live in.

15:31.701 --> 15:35.240
Remind me never
To go swimming in
The east river again.

15:35.241 --> 15:39.816
Oh, when will people realize
That they're destroying
Their own water supply ?

15:39.817 --> 15:42.087
Donatello calling april.

15:42.088 --> 15:43.589
Come in, april.

15:43.590 --> 15:44.892
She's not answering.

15:44.893 --> 15:47.396
Maybe she's out
Looking for us.

15:47.397 --> 15:50.335
Ah, not a great idea
With those tin twerps
Roaming the streets.

15:50.336 --> 15:51.939
We'll find her.

15:51.940 --> 15:54.243
I'll set the homing device
On my communicator.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.447
Let's go.

15:56.448 --> 15:59.720
Those robots have turned
The city into a war zone.

16:01.024 --> 16:03.627
<I>halt.
<I>you are under arrest.

16:03.628 --> 16:06.032
<I>surrender in the name
<I>of emperor shredder.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.036
Emperor shredder,
Is it ?

16:09.105 --> 16:11.375
No, rex !
What are you doing ?

16:11.376 --> 16:12.979
<I>just following orders.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.550
<I>i am programmed to serve
<I>and protect you. Remember ?

16:15.551 --> 16:18.188
<I>your usefulness is over,
<I>rex-1.

16:18.189 --> 16:19.591
<I>you must be destroyed.

16:27.908 --> 16:30.746
<I>rex-1 is
<I>no longer operative

16:30.747 --> 16:33.417
<I>all hail
<I>to emperor shredder.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.722
Oh, no.
Poor rex.

16:35.723 --> 16:36.824
<I>more enemies.

16:36.825 --> 16:38.661
<I>we must make them
<I>inoperative.

16:38.662 --> 16:42.201
Don't bet your circuit
Boards on it, pal.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.505
<I>the criminals !
<I>destroy them.

16:44.506 --> 16:45.841
Don't sweat it, turtles.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.945
I'll handle this.

16:52.756 --> 16:56.028
Whoa, bummer.
What happened to rex ?

16:56.029 --> 16:58.031
He's in pretty bad
Shape.

16:58.032 --> 17:01.404
This is all my fault.
I had to have my big scoop.

17:01.405 --> 17:03.307
Now rex is smashed up,

17:03.308 --> 17:06.480
And there's an army of evil
Clones taking over the city.

17:06.481 --> 17:09.619
This is
Shredder's doing,
Not yours.

17:09.621 --> 17:11.390
I have an idea

17:11.391 --> 17:15.064
How we might be able to gain
Control of those other robots.

17:16.434 --> 17:18.236
Wire.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.739
Transistor tube.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.912
Oh, man !
Did you have
To use our tv

17:22.913 --> 17:24.481
For spare parts ?

17:24.482 --> 17:27.654
I had no choice. We don't have
Time to run out and buy any.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.825
Please say he's going
To pull through, donatello.

17:29.826 --> 17:31.194
Please.

17:31.195 --> 17:32.730
He'd better.
He's our only hope

17:32.731 --> 17:34.300
Against those
Rex clones.

17:34.301 --> 17:36.003
Videotapes.

17:36.004 --> 17:39.210
No ! Not my favorite flicks !

17:39.211 --> 17:43.283
Sorry, michelangelo, but
We need tapes to install
His new program.

17:43.284 --> 17:46.223
Ah. There.
We've done all we can.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.743
All right !

17:56.744 --> 17:59.281
<I>my name is rex-1.

17:59.282 --> 18:03.088
<I>my job is--
<I>my job is--
<I>my job is--

18:03.089 --> 18:05.092
<I>to serve and
<I>protect you.

18:05.093 --> 18:07.329
Donatello,
You're a genius.

18:07.330 --> 18:08.866
Who am i
To argue ?

18:08.867 --> 18:09.968
This is great.

18:09.969 --> 18:12.273
But what
About the other robots ?

18:12.274 --> 18:14.209
Oh, i programmed rex
To control them,

18:14.210 --> 18:16.180
But his range
Is limited.

18:16.181 --> 18:18.284
I borrowed a part
From an old toaster.

18:18.285 --> 18:22.091
Which means we must
Lure the robots
Into our trap,

18:22.092 --> 18:24.396
And i know
Just the thing.

18:24.397 --> 18:27.467
Fireworks ?
What good are those ?

18:27.468 --> 18:30.975
Just be patient, raphael,
And you shall see.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.413
All right, master.
Here goes.

18:37.354 --> 18:39.825
It's--it's us.

18:39.826 --> 18:42.129
Actually i think
It looks more
Like me.

18:42.130 --> 18:46.070
Whoa, man.
Totally awesome.

18:46.071 --> 18:47.573
What now,
Splinter ?

18:47.574 --> 18:49.109
The trap has been set.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.847
Now we wait to close it.

18:56.791 --> 18:59.428
<I>emperor shredder,
<I>the turtles live.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.399
<I>they are at
<I>the amusement park.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.403
They live, do they ?

19:03.404 --> 19:05.407
Well, they won't for long.

19:05.408 --> 19:06.909
Summoning all rexes.

19:06.910 --> 19:09.414
Converge
On the amusement park

19:09.415 --> 19:11.351
And destroy the turtles.

19:11.352 --> 19:14.524
<I>turtles, we know
<I>you are in there.

19:14.525 --> 19:16.395
<I>come out
<I>with your hands up.

19:16.396 --> 19:19.133
Steady, guys.
They're almost within range.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.977
Are you sure
This is going to
Work ?

19:24.978 --> 19:27.582
It better,
Or we're all dead meat.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.692
<I>all right, you varmints.
<I>eat lead.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.827
Varmints.

19:33.828 --> 19:35.097
I, uh, i guess i got

19:35.098 --> 19:36.733
A western movie
In there, too.

19:36.734 --> 19:38.002
<I>golly, toto,

19:38.003 --> 19:39.772
<I>this doesn't look
<I>like kansas to me.

19:41.242 --> 19:43.546
<I>hey, moe !
<I>woo-woo-woo-woo !

19:44.749 --> 19:47.052
We've got
To do something.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.056
We're right with
You, leonardo.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.394
Forget him, dudes.

19:51.395 --> 19:53.565
Try those peashooters
On us.

19:53.566 --> 19:55.702
That's it.
Keep drawing
Their fire.

19:57.974 --> 19:59.042
Care for a little spin ?

20:01.013 --> 20:04.753
<I>surrender in the name
<I>of emperor shredder.

20:04.754 --> 20:07.625
You got
To catch us first, dude.

20:07.626 --> 20:10.798
Tough tamales, tin man.

20:10.799 --> 20:13.669
<I>you are enemies of the state.
<I>your sentence is death.

20:14.807 --> 20:18.146
Whoa, feel like i'm
In a shooting gallery.

20:18.147 --> 20:21.819
Hurry, donatello.
We can't keep
This up much longer.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.488
No duh !

20:23.489 --> 20:25.860
<I>i order you to put
<I>down your weapons.

20:25.861 --> 20:28.698
<I>and what will you
<I>do if we refuse ?

20:28.699 --> 20:31.738
<I>you leave me
<I>only one recourse.

20:31.739 --> 20:36.480
<I>1-2, 1-2.
<I>no pain, no gain.

20:36.481 --> 20:37.782
What happened ?

20:37.783 --> 20:39.986
Something
Got fouled up.

20:39.987 --> 20:41.757
That's my aerobics
Workout tape.

20:41.758 --> 20:44.428
<I>1-2, 1-2, 1-2.
<I>be like a birdie.

20:44.429 --> 20:47.134
<I>1-2, 1-2, 1-2.
<I>be like birds.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.611
All right, bud.

20:52.612 --> 20:54.514
It worked.
It worked.

20:54.515 --> 20:59.257
Blast you, turtles.
You've done it to me again.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.432
But one day, turtles,
I will win.

21:03.433 --> 21:06.504
<I>and so the entire robot
<I>enforcement experiment

21:06.505 --> 21:08.140
<I>has been abandoned.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.144
Oh, well, rex-1,
Wherever you are,

21:10.145 --> 21:13.316
You were only
A robot,

21:13.317 --> 21:15.053
But i kinda liked
You.

21:15.054 --> 21:17.893
April !

21:17.894 --> 21:19.595
My date and i are
Going to the movies.

21:19.596 --> 21:21.399
You want to join us ?

21:21.400 --> 21:22.735
I don't think so,
Irma.

21:22.736 --> 21:27.410
You might change your mind
When you see who it is.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.412
Rex !

21:28.413 --> 21:30.917
And we have you
To thank, april.

21:30.918 --> 21:33.255
After all,
You introduced us.

21:33.256 --> 21:35.893
<I>my job is to serve
<I>and protect

21:35.894 --> 21:38.197
<I>and take irma
<I>to the movies.

21:38.198 --> 21:40.702
He's such a quick learner.
