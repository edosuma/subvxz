09:53.526 --> 09:54.961
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN AMERICAN

09:55.027 --> 09:55.227
DEMOCRACY.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.096
THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE THAT I

09:57.163 --> 10:00.032
WOULD JOIN YOUR NUTTY PARTY.

I GO ON FOX NEWS AND I GET

10:13.279 --> 10:15.147
CRITICIZED FROM THE LEFT, WHY

10:22.688 --> 10:24.824
FOX NEWS AND I SAY I WE REALLY

10:24.890 --> 10:27.093
NOT ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION?

10:27.159 --> 10:28.194
HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE IN YOUR

10:28.260 --> 10:28.828
IDEAS.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.262

10:36.902 --> 10:37.870
CANCELING TONI MORRISON, ONE OF

10:37.937 --> 10:42.074
THE GREATEST AUTHORS?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.443
>> Bill: ANYWAY, MY POINT

10:44.510 --> 10:45.444
BEING, NOT REPUBLICANS SAYING

10:45.511 --> 10:46.245
THE ECONOMY IS THE MOST

10:46.312 --> 10:47.813
IMPORTANT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT,

10:47.880 --> 10:50.616
THOSE OF THE TWO IMPORTANT

10:50.683 --> 10:51.484
ISSUES AND THE DEMOCRACY ONE IS

10:51.550 --> 10:53.986
ON THE TIP OF MY MIND -- YOU

10:56.222 --> 10:57.156
BEFORE I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE

YOU HAVE 12 MONTHS LEFT, WHAT

11:02.695 --> 11:05.498
ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

11:05.564 --> 11:07.800
WHAT TRUMP IS GOING TO TRY TO DO

11:07.867 --> 11:09.702
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

11:09.769 --> 11:12.872
>> WE ARE PASSING THE ELECTORAL

11:12.938 --> 11:13.873
COUNT ACT, IT'S IN A AN

11:13.939 --> 11:14.640

11:17.243 --> 11:18.577

11:39.198 --> 11:40.633
ELECTIONS ANYMORE.

11:45.504 --> 11:45.838
SIGNIFICANT THING.

11:45.905 --> 11:52.912
THERE'S SO MUCH DOOM OR IN THIS

WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONG.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.728
HERE'S WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

12:27.012 --> 12:27.780
DEMOCRACY, I DON'T KNOW, I THINK

12:27.847 --> 12:28.848
THAT IS A CHEERFUL WAY OF

12:28.914 --> 12:29.949
LOOKING AT THE FUTURE AND MUST

12:30.015 --> 12:30.983
DONALD TRUMP DISAPPEARS FROM THE

12:31.050 --> 12:32.118
SCENE FOR WHATEVER REASON.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.586
HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO WHAT HE

12:33.652 --> 12:35.454
DID LAST TIME AND HE'S PUTTING

12:35.521 --> 12:37.690
IN PLACE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW TO SAY

12:37.756 --> 12:39.225
YES WHEN HE ASKS FOR THEM TO

12:39.291 --> 12:42.161

I'M GLAD YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC, I'M

13:04.049 --> 13:05.451
IMPORTANT THING IN THIS

13:05.518 --> 13:05.918
ELECTORAL COUNT ACT.

13:05.985 --> 13:06.752
[APPLAUSE]

13:06.819 --> 13:08.387
I NEVER THOUGHT -- I'M 45 YEARS

13:08.454 --> 13:09.588
OLD -- I NEVER THOUGHT GROWING

13:09.655 --> 13:11.457
UP I WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT THE

13:11.524 --> 13:12.725
SAME FIGHTS THAT WERE FOUGHT IN

13:12.791 --> 13:14.193
THE 1960s.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.394
ARE WE REALLY FIGHTING TO SAY

13:15.461 --> 13:16.729
THERE SHOULD BE AN EQUAL AMOUNT

13:16.795 --> 13:19.198
OF BALLOT BOXES IN BLACK

13:19.265 --> 13:20.032
COMMUNITIES AS WHITE

13:20.099 --> 13:20.332
COMMUNITIES?

13:20.399 --> 13:23.435
HOW SAD THAT IN 2021-2022 WE ARE

13:23.502 --> 13:26.405
HAVING TO HAVE THOSE FIGHTS.

13:26.472 --> 13:26.672

13:26.739 --> 13:30.643
>> Bill: LET'S WIN THEM.

13:30.709 --> 13:31.844
I'M NOT SURPRISED WE ARE STILL

13:31.911 --> 13:33.179
HAVING THEM BECAUSE I THINK WE

13:33.245 --> 13:34.013
WILL HAVE THEM FOR A VERY LONG

13:34.079 --> 13:37.650
TIME BUT WE DO HAVE TO WIN THEM.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.755
INTERESTING.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.323
I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE

13:44.390 --> 13:45.391
UNDERSTAND -- THEY KNOW THE TERM

13:45.457 --> 13:46.692
BUT IT GOES THROUGH ABOUT EIGHT

13:46.759 --> 13:48.360
OR NINE STATES.

13:48.427 --> 13:52.932
MOSTLY IT'S THE SOUTH, IF YOU

13:58.737 --> 14:01.640
APPALACHIA, BRILLIANT MOVIE.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.276
PEOPLE KNOW THAT AREA OF THE

14:04.343 --> 14:04.910
COUNTRY, WEST VIRGINIA -- IT'S

14:04.977 --> 14:08.847
ROUGH IF YOU GO IN THERE -- IT'S

14:08.914 --> 14:12.418
THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.520
SOMETIMES AUTHORITY, STATE,

14:19.825 --> 14:20.960
THAT INTO -- YOU'RE FROM

14:21.026 --> 14:22.962
SILICON VALLEY -- YOU COULD MAKE

14:23.028 --> 14:24.096
THAT INTO A TECH CENTER.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.831
>> THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT I'M

14:25.898 --> 14:26.732

14:47.086 --> 14:49.855
SMART LAUNDRY MACHINES AND SMART

THERE'S GOING TO BE 25 MILLION

14:51.890 --> 14:53.726
DIGITAL JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY,

14:53.792 --> 14:55.027
THAT'S MORE THAN MANUFACTURING

14:57.029 --> 14:58.063
>> Bill: HOW MANY?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.332

COMPONENT.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.905
YOU WANT TO MAKE A CAR, IT HAS A

15:06.972 --> 15:07.606
TECH COMPONENT, YOU WANT TO MAKE

15:07.673 --> 15:10.809

15:22.321 --> 15:23.756
MY DISTRICT, WE HAVE TO BRING

15:23.822 --> 15:25.991
THESE JOBS TO PLACES SO PEOPLE

15:26.058 --> 15:26.525
CAN LIVE.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.226
>> Bill: HILLARY CLINTON TRIED

15:27.293 --> 15:29.495
TO SELL THIS.

15:29.561 --> 15:33.299
>> NO.

15:33.365 --> 15:33.632
SHE SAID MOVE.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.001

WE'LL WE TRAIN YOU.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.707
AND THEY SAID YOU'RE FROM THE

15:41.774 --> 15:43.442
GOVERNMENT WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.411
THAT'S A NICE IDEA BUT WE

15:45.477 --> 15:47.146
ACTUALLY HAVE A JOB IN THE MINE.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.047
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

15:48.113 --> 15:49.181
DIFFERENTLY SO THEY DON'T HAVE

15:49.248 --> 15:52.151
THAT REACTION?

15:52.217 --> 15:54.253
>> COAL MINING JOBS A LOT OF

15:54.320 --> 15:55.154
THEM HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED,

15:55.220 --> 15:56.155
THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE OF THOSE

15:56.221 --> 15:56.555
JOBS.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.057
THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE NEW

15:58.123 --> 15:59.525
JOBS GOING TO BE FOR THE KIDS?

15:59.591 --> 16:01.193
WE HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THIS

16:01.260 --> 16:02.695
NEW IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO

16:02.761 --> 16:05.030
MAKE A COAL MINER A CODER --

TECHNICAL COMPONENT.

16:16.141 --> 16:16.975
THOSE JOBS SHOULDN'T JUST BE FOR

16:17.042 --> 16:18.243
THE KIDS IN MY DISTRICT AND YOU

16:25.484 --> 16:26.585
THESE COMMUNITIES?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.554
KNOW THERE AND THINK THEY DON'T

16:28.620 --> 16:29.054
GET IT?

16:29.121 --> 16:30.956
OF COURSE THEY GET IT, THEY KNOW

16:31.023 --> 16:32.157
WHERE THE WEALTH IS BEING MADE.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.360
FOR 40 YEARS THEY HAD BEEN

16:34.426 --> 16:37.229
IGNORED, JOBS HAVE GONE OFFSHORE

16:37.296 --> 16:38.430
THERE'S BEEN DEINDUSTRIALIZATION

16:38.497 --> 16:39.598

16:39.665 --> 16:42.000
THEY'VE BEEN TOLD GO MOVE AND GO

16:42.067 --> 16:43.035
GET TRAINED AND THE JOBS HAVEN'T

16:54.713 --> 16:57.049
EVEN PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS THAT

16:57.116 --> 16:58.917
USE HANDOUTS, WEST VIRGINIA GETS

16:58.984 --> 17:00.285
MORE FEDERAL MONEY THAN ANY

17:00.352 --> 17:00.486
STATE.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.988

17:08.293 --> 17:09.495
AND FREE COLLEGE BUT THAT'S NOT

17:09.561 --> 17:10.963
ENOUGH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY

17:11.029 --> 17:11.997
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.266
CLEVELAND USED TO BE THE

17:14.333 --> 17:15.234
SILICON VALLEY IN THE 20TH

17:15.300 --> 17:15.601
CENTURY.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.269
AMERICANS ARE A PROUD PEOPLE WE

17:17.336 --> 17:19.371
WANT TO BUILD WEALTH, WE WANT TO

17:19.438 --> 17:19.705
CREATE THINGS.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.106
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO HAVE A

17:21.173 --> 17:22.641
MESSAGE OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO

17:22.708 --> 17:23.876
GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO PEOPLE TO

17:23.942 --> 17:25.644
CREATE THINGS AND BUILD THINGS

17:25.711 --> 17:26.245
IN THEIR HOMETOWN.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.647
WE HAVE TO HAVE A MESSAGE OF

17:28.714 --> 17:30.783
PATRIOTISM.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.252
THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.286
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:34.353 --> 17:36.455
>> Bill: IT SEEMS LIKE THE

17:36.522 --> 17:39.391
DEMOCRATS -- THEIR REPUTATION

17:39.458 --> 17:41.794
ANYWAY -- IS ANTI-WEALTH.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.395
AND YET MOST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

17:43.462 --> 17:45.164
ARE DEMOCRATS OR LEAN THAT WAY

17:45.230 --> 17:46.799
AND YOU LOOK AT INSTAGRAM, ALL

17:46.865 --> 17:49.067
THEY DO IS PRETEND THEY ARE

17:49.134 --> 17:49.601
WEALTHY.

17:49.668 --> 17:50.369
[LAUGHTER]

17:50.436 --> 17:52.571
THEY WANT WEALTH MORE THAN

17:52.638 --> 17:54.306
ANYBODY, THEY PRETEND THEY ARE

17:54.373 --> 17:55.441
IN A PRIVATE JET.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.942
WHY DON'T YOU BECOME THE PARTY

17:57.009 --> 17:58.377
OF LET'S ALL GET RICH?

17:58.444 --> 18:00.579
>> I'M ALL FOR CREATION OF

18:00.646 --> 18:01.680
WEALTH, BUILDING WEALTH.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.649
ONE OF THE REASONS DONALD TRUMP

18:03.715 --> 18:05.250
DID BETTER WITH YOUNG

18:05.317 --> 18:06.151
AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS, HE SOLD

18:06.218 --> 18:09.755
THEM A TOTALLY BOGUS PLATINUM

18:09.822 --> 18:10.522
PLAN.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.457
PEOPLE HAVE ASPIRATION TO MAKE

18:11.523 --> 18:13.792
MONEY, TO BE WEALTHY.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.794
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A PATH TO

18:15.861 --> 18:17.362
DOING THAT TO.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.964
YES, THE DEMOCRATS OUGHT TO HAVE

18:19.031 --> 18:20.632
AN █ASPIRATIONAL, ECONOMIC

18:20.699 --> 18:23.602
MESSAGE, WE OUGHT NOT TO

18:23.669 --> 18:23.969
DEMONIZE WEALTH.

18:24.036 --> 18:24.870
BUT WE SAY IF YOU'VE DONE WELL

18:24.937 --> 18:27.639
YOU CAN PAY MORE SO EVERYONE HAS

18:27.706 --> 18:27.973
THE SAME SHOT.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.609
THE SHOT YOU AND I HAD TO.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.377
YOU PROBABLY HAD A DECENT

18:32.444 --> 18:33.078
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, YOU

18:33.145 --> 18:33.979
PROBABLY HAD NUTRITION, YOU

18:34.046 --> 18:36.548
PROBABLY GREW UP IN A SAFE

18:36.615 --> 18:36.949
COMMUNITY -- FINE.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.585
LET'S GIVE EVERYONE THAT SHOT

18:39.651 --> 18:40.252
AND GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY

18:40.319 --> 18:42.955
TO CREATE WEALTH OR KILL >>

18:43.021 --> 18:45.224
Bill: ALL RIGHT, SHAKE MY HAND

KATHERINE MANGU-WARD.

19:04.343 --> 19:08.747
GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK HERE.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.849
IS YOUR HAIR MORE PURPLE?

19:10.916 --> 19:13.418
>> IT'S ALWAYS MORE PURPLE.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.020
>> Bill: I MISS SO MUCH.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.321
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK

19:16.388 --> 19:17.089
"STOLEN FOCUS: WHY YOU CAN'T PAY

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:24.730 --> 19:28.000
LET'S START WITH THAT.

19:28.066 --> 19:28.967
IT'S SORT OF A THEME SHOW --

19:29.034 --> 19:30.536
IT'S FUNNY THAT IS WHAT I WAS

19:30.602 --> 19:33.372
WORKING ON THIS WEEK, THAT IDEA

19:33.438 --> 19:34.106
AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE END OF

19:34.172 --> 19:38.777
OUR SHOW -- A LITTLE TEASER.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.444
ABOUT LOSING FOCUS AND YOUR BOOK

19:39.511 --> 19:40.178
IS ALL ABOUT THAT.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.447
IT FASCINATES ME BECAUSE HERE IS

19:42.514 --> 19:44.983
A GREAT LINE I READ IN THE BOOK.

19:45.050 --> 19:45.584
"IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A

19:45.651 --> 19:50.222
NORMAL BRAIN TODAY."

19:50.289 --> 19:51.423
WE CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON

19:51.490 --> 19:51.690
ANYTHING.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.258
WHAT IS THAT, WHAT ARE THE MAIN

19:53.325 --> 19:55.427
REASONS WE CAN'T HAVE A NORMAL

19:55.494 --> 19:56.628
BRAIN AND CONCENTRATE?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.797
>> THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME, I

19:58.864 --> 20:02.534
KNOW THIS -- WITH EACH YEAR THAT

20:02.601 --> 20:03.168
PASSED MY ABILITY TO PAY DEEP

20:03.235 --> 20:04.069
ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE READING

20:04.136 --> 20:06.104
A BOOK WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE

20:06.171 --> 20:06.772
LIKE RUNNING UP AND DOWN AN

20:06.838 --> 20:08.907
ESCALATOR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:08.974 --> 20:10.042
>> Bill: I'M SORRY, SAY THAT

20:10.108 --> 20:14.212
AGAIN, I WASN'T LISTENING.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.714
[LAUGHTER]

20:15.781 --> 20:17.549
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

20:17.616 --> 20:19.084
>> I REALIZE THIS ISN'T JUST ME,

20:19.151 --> 20:21.453
ONE STUDY FOR EXAMPLE FOUND THE

20:21.520 --> 20:22.120
AVERAGE AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT

20:22.187 --> 20:23.355
CAN'T FOCUS MORE THAN A COUPLE

20:23.422 --> 20:25.123
MINUTES WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO

20:25.190 --> 20:27.459
STUDY, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

20:27.526 --> 20:28.493
OFFICE WORKER NOW FOCUSES FOR

20:28.560 --> 20:30.729
ONLY 3 MINUTES ON ANY GIVEN TASK

20:30.796 --> 20:31.396
ON AVERAGE.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.165
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

20:33.231 --> 20:34.032
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US.

20:34.099 --> 20:37.436
I WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND

20:37.502 --> 20:38.770
INTERVIEWED 200 LEADING EXPERTS

20:38.837 --> 20:40.405
ON FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND I

20:40.472 --> 20:42.040
LIVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

20:42.107 --> 20:42.808
WAS 12 FACTORS THAT CAN MAKE

20:42.874 --> 20:45.744
YOUR ATTENTION BETTER OR MAKE IT

20:45.811 --> 20:48.614
WORSE.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.348
LOADS OF FACTORS MAKING

20:49.414 --> 20:50.983
ATTENTION WARS HAVE BEEN

20:51.049 --> 20:51.550
INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS.

20:51.617 --> 20:52.651
>> Bill: THE PHONE.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.788
>> THE TECH -- WHEN I STARTED

20:56.855 --> 20:57.489
DOING THE RESEARCH I THOUGHT

20:57.556 --> 20:59.324
TECH WOULD BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST

20:59.391 --> 20:59.958
FACTOR.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.460
OF THE 12 FACTORS THERE ARE

21:01.526 --> 21:04.763
COMPONENTS OF THE TECH WE USE

21:04.830 --> 21:05.364
THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

21:05.430 --> 21:09.301
TO INVADE AND HACK OUR ATTENTIO

21:09.368 --> 21:09.568
ATTENTION.

21:09.635 --> 21:10.602
THAT'S ONE FACTOR WE'VE GOT TO

21:10.669 --> 21:13.438
DEAL WITH, ONE AMONG MANY.

21:13.505 --> 21:13.839
>> Bill: FOOD TO.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.642
>> THE WAY WE EAT IS HUGELY

21:16.708 --> 21:17.309
DAMAGING TO FOCUS AND ATTENTION.

21:17.376 --> 21:20.012
>> Bill: SLEEP.

21:20.078 --> 21:24.616
>> EXACTLY.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.185
>> Bill: YES, I READ YOUR

21:27.252 --> 21:30.222
BOOK, OF COURSE I KEPT THOSE --

21:30.288 --> 21:30.789
[LAUGHTER]

21:30.856 --> 21:33.225
>> THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, I WOULD

21:33.291 --> 21:34.426
SAY TO ANYONE WATCHING.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.193
THINK ABOUT ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER

21:35.260 --> 21:36.662
ACHIEVED IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU

21:36.728 --> 21:38.363
WERE PROUD OF WHETHER IT'S

21:38.430 --> 21:39.765
STARTING A BUSINESS, BEING A

21:39.831 --> 21:41.400
GOOD PARENT, LEARNING TO PLAY

21:41.466 --> 21:41.767
THE GUITAR.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.268
WHATEVER THAT THING YOU ARE

21:43.335 --> 21:46.371
PROUD OF IS IT TOOK A HUGE

21:46.438 --> 21:47.773
AMOUNT OF SUSTAINED FOCUS AND

21:47.839 --> 21:48.040
ATTENTION.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.241
ONE FOCUS AND ATTENTION

21:49.307 --> 21:51.176
BREAKDOWN AS I BELIEVE THEY ARE

21:51.243 --> 21:52.611
BREAKING DOWN NOW I THINK THE

21:52.678 --> 21:54.579
SCIENCE IS PRETTY CLEAR, YOUR

21:54.646 --> 21:56.448
ABILITY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS

21:56.515 --> 21:57.649
AND ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS AGAINST A

21:57.716 --> 21:59.051
BREAKDOWN AND THAT IS TRUE AT A

21:59.117 --> 22:01.219
PERSONAL LEVEL AND A COLLECTIVE

22:01.286 --> 22:01.553
SOCIAL LEVEL.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.423
>> Bill: HOW DOES THIS REVERSE

22:04.489 --> 22:04.723
ITSELF EVER?

22:04.790 --> 22:05.557
DOES IT?

22:05.624 --> 22:13.165
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO LEVELS

22:13.231 --> 22:14.599
LEVELS --

22:14.666 --> 22:16.568
>> DUE RESPECT TO THE EXPERT I

22:16.635 --> 22:19.471
THINK THERE IS MAY BE WAY TO

22:19.538 --> 22:21.573
LOOK AT THIS, I THINK WE ARE IN

22:21.640 --> 22:22.974
A CHANGING WORLD.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.343
WHEN WE SAY "NORMAL BRAIN" WE

22:25.410 --> 22:26.812
MEAN A BRAIN THAT WAS BUILT FOR

22:26.878 --> 22:30.215
A WORLD THAT IS GONE NOW.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.383
I THINK A LOT OF MY SUCCESS HAS

22:31.450 --> 22:34.019
BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT I CAN

22:34.086 --> 22:34.986
TOGGLE VERY QUICKLY BETWEEN

22:35.053 --> 22:36.188
TASKS AND ONE THING THAT ENABLES

22:36.254 --> 22:37.389
THAT IS THE SAME TECH YOU ARE

22:37.456 --> 22:39.224
WORRIED ABOUT, IT MAKES US WAY

22:39.291 --> 22:39.791
MORE PRODUCTIVE.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.494
THIS NOTION THAT WE CAN ONLY DO

22:42.561 --> 22:45.063
MEANINGFUL THINGS IF WE DO IT

22:45.130 --> 22:45.330
SLOWLY --

22:45.397 --> 22:47.365
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

22:47.432 --> 22:47.566
THAT.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.868
I READ IN YOUR BOOK THAT I READ

22:49.935 --> 22:52.137
THIS?

22:52.204 --> 22:52.971
[LAUGHTER]

22:53.038 --> 22:54.406
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE THINK THEY

22:54.473 --> 22:55.674
CAN MULTITASK BUT THEY ARE NOT

22:55.741 --> 22:56.942
REALLY MULTITASKING, AND MY

22:57.008 --> 22:57.275
RIGHT?

22:57.342 --> 22:58.677
THEY THINK THEY ARE DOING THREE

22:58.744 --> 22:59.644
THINGS AT ONCE AND THEY ARE

22:59.711 --> 23:01.780
REALLY DOING NO THINGS AT ONCE

23:01.847 --> 23:02.848
BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING THEM

23:02.914 --> 23:05.050
ALL UP BECAUSE THEY ARE

23:05.117 --> 23:05.617
CONCENTRATING ON ANYTHING.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.918
>> I USED TO SAY WHAT YOU SAID

23:06.985 --> 23:08.587
UNTIL I STARTED TO LOOK AT THE

23:08.653 --> 23:11.389
SCIENCE, IT'S PRETTY SOBERING.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.924
EARL MILLER, ONE OF THE LEADING

23:12.991 --> 23:15.994
SCIENTISTS AT MIT IS ONE THING

23:16.061 --> 23:16.628
ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN YOU NEED

23:16.695 --> 23:20.599
TO UNDERSTAND, YOU CAN ONLY

23:20.665 --> 23:21.800
CONSCIOUSLY THINK ABOUT ONE OR

23:21.867 --> 23:23.802
TWO GO THINGS AT A TIME, IT'S A

23:23.869 --> 23:25.604
FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT OF THE HUMAN

23:25.670 --> 23:25.871
BRAIN.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.005
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TEENAGER

23:27.072 --> 23:28.273
NOW BELIEVES THEY CAN FOLLOW SIX

23:28.340 --> 23:30.041
OR SEVEN THINGS AT THE SAME

23:30.108 --> 23:30.375
TIME.

23:30.442 --> 23:31.543
WHEN SCIENTISTS GET THEM INTO

23:31.610 --> 23:32.577
LABS AND THEY GET THEM TO THINK

23:32.644 --> 23:33.678
THEY ARE DOING MORE THAN ONE

23:33.745 --> 23:35.180
THING AT A TIME, WHAT YOU

23:35.247 --> 23:36.414
DISCOVER IS THEY ARE JUGGLING

23:36.481 --> 23:39.417
AND THAT COMES WITH A REALLY BIG

23:39.484 --> 23:39.618
COSTS.

23:39.684 --> 23:40.619
AT IS CALLED THE SWITCH

23:40.685 --> 23:40.986
COST-EFFECTIVE.

23:41.052 --> 23:41.953
WHEN YOU TRY TO DO MORE THAN ONE

23:42.020 --> 23:43.855
THING AT A TIME IT TURNS OUT

23:43.922 --> 23:45.557
EVEN PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE

23:45.624 --> 23:46.591
GOOD AT IT, YOU DO ALL THE

23:46.658 --> 23:48.727
THINGS YOU ARE TRYING TO DO MUCH

23:48.794 --> 23:49.594
LESS COMPETENTLY.

23:49.661 --> 23:50.695
YOU MAKE MORE MISTAKES YOU

23:50.762 --> 23:53.331
REMEMBER LESS OF WHAT YOU WILL

23:53.398 --> 23:53.832
LEARN, THIS IS WHAT

23:53.899 --> 23:55.967
PROFESSOR MILLER AND SCIENTISTS

23:56.034 --> 23:57.836
SAID WE ARE LIVING IN A PERFECT

23:57.903 --> 24:00.806
STORM OF COGNITIVE DEGRADATION.

24:00.872 --> 24:03.642
>> Bill: HOW DO WE REVERSE IT?

24:03.708 --> 24:05.944
>> IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE

24:06.011 --> 24:06.945
APOCALYPSE, IT CAN'T BE THAT WE

24:07.012 --> 24:08.780
ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE AT

24:08.847 --> 24:09.414
TIMES, THE TECHNOLOGY IS KILLING

24:09.481 --> 24:12.184
US ALL.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.820
THE ANSWER TO HOW DO WE REVERSE

24:14.886 --> 24:15.387
IT IN THE PARTS OF YOUR BOOK

24:15.453 --> 24:17.322
THAT I THOUGHT WERE THE BEST

24:17.389 --> 24:18.857
WITH A THINGS YOU JUST MAKE

24:18.924 --> 24:20.192
DIFFERENT DECISIONS.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.493
OF COURSE THERE ARE CULTURAL AND

24:21.560 --> 24:24.329
SOCIETAL LIMITS ON OUR CHOICES,

24:24.396 --> 24:26.731
BUT THERE IS GOOD ADVICE IN THE

24:26.798 --> 24:27.098
BOOK.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.133
PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT

24:28.200 --> 24:29.201
AND THAT'S THE EMPHASIS WE

24:29.267 --> 24:30.235
SHOULD PUT, NOT THAT SOMEHOW

24:30.302 --> 24:32.237
CONGRESS NEEDS TO MAKE FACEBOOK

24:32.304 --> 24:35.740
BE LESS GOOD AT SO WE LOOK AT SO

24:35.807 --> 24:36.408
MUCH WHICH IS A REAL TEMPTATION.

24:36.474 --> 24:40.011
[APPLAUSE]

24:40.078 --> 24:41.146
>> YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT, THERE'S

24:41.213 --> 24:43.415
A HUGE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE

24:43.481 --> 24:44.049
MUCH BETTER NOW THAN THEY WERE

24:44.115 --> 24:46.218
IN THE PAST BUT I THINK

24:46.284 --> 24:48.253
ATTENTION IS GETTING WORSE AND

24:48.320 --> 24:48.820
THERE'S TWO WAYS WE NEED TO

24:48.887 --> 24:50.388
RESPOND TO THIS.

24:50.455 --> 24:51.790
DEFENSE AND OFFENSE, THERE'S

24:51.857 --> 24:52.324
DOZENS OF THINGS THAT I GO

24:52.390 --> 24:54.893
THROUGH IN THE BOOK ABOUT HOW WE

24:54.960 --> 24:58.630
NEED TO DEFEND OURSELVES AND OUR

24:58.697 --> 25:00.131
CHILDREN AS INDIVIDUALS -- A BIG

25:00.198 --> 25:02.300
PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR

25:02.367 --> 25:03.468
KIDS WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BAD I

25:03.535 --> 25:04.236
KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SO

25:04.302 --> 25:05.971
PATHETIC TO -- I WANT TO BE

25:06.037 --> 25:07.372
HONEST WITH PEOPLE, THAT WILL

25:07.439 --> 25:08.707
ONLY GIVE US SO FAR.

25:08.773 --> 25:10.609
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE IS POOR

25:10.675 --> 25:11.576
ITCHING POWDER OVER US ALL DAY

25:11.643 --> 25:12.811
AND WE ARE RESPONDING AND THAT

25:12.878 --> 25:14.412
PERSON LEADS FORWARD AND GOES

25:14.479 --> 25:16.481
YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO

25:16.548 --> 25:16.748
MEDITATE.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.350
>> Bill: IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

25:18.416 --> 25:19.584
BETTER, I'M GOING TO TURN OVER

25:19.651 --> 25:19.918
ALL THE CARDS.

25:19.985 --> 25:23.822
IT'S JUST NOT.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.523
WE ARE JUST GOING TO GO ON THE

25:25.590 --> 25:27.092
PATH AND SOMEHOW FIND A WAY --

25:27.158 --> 25:28.994
>> I THINK HUMANS ARE INCREDIBLY

25:29.060 --> 25:30.161
ADAPTABLE, I THINK TECHNOLOGY

25:30.228 --> 25:33.131
HAS CHANGED RADICALLY OVER THE

25:33.198 --> 25:34.065
COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY AND IT

25:34.132 --> 25:35.600
SEEMS BROADLY THAT THINGS ARE

25:35.667 --> 25:37.202
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.003
>> Bill: I THINK WE ARE

25:38.069 --> 25:42.607
TOTALLY FUCKED.

25:42.674 --> 25:43.642
I DO.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.175
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

25:44.242 --> 25:46.011
YOU DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN ON A

25:46.077 --> 25:47.746
DOWNWARD SLANT FOR MANY, MANY

25:47.812 --> 25:47.946
YEARS?

25:48.013 --> 25:51.016
>> I GET IT THAT THE WORLD IS

25:51.082 --> 25:51.416
CHANGING --

25:51.483 --> 25:53.218
>> Bill: NOT CHANGING, OF

25:53.285 --> 25:53.852
COURSE ALWAYS CHANGING.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.520
>> WE HAVE A SHIFT IN

25:55.587 --> 25:55.854
CONSCIOUSNESS.

25:55.921 --> 25:58.490
>> MAY BE PEOPLE USE TO AN OLDER

25:58.556 --> 25:59.491
WAY OF LIFE LOOK AT THE NEW

25:59.557 --> 26:02.861
WORLD AND TO SEE IT LOOK

26:02.928 --> 26:06.564
ALARMING A DIFFERENT.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.565
>> Bill: FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S

26:07.632 --> 26:10.669
A CHEAP SHOT, HOW COULD YOU

26:10.735 --> 26:13.738
KNOW, YOUR OLDER?

26:13.805 --> 26:14.906
YOU'RE NOT 25.

26:14.973 --> 26:17.008
>> THAT'S TRUE, I THINK THE

26:17.075 --> 26:20.211
OPPOSITE POINT HERE IS THAT

26:20.278 --> 26:21.846
THINGS ARE CHANGING BECAUSE

26:21.913 --> 26:22.247
TRANSITION COSTS.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.448
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE

26:23.515 --> 26:24.649
PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE IN THE SHIFT

26:24.716 --> 26:26.518
BUT THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO

26:26.584 --> 26:28.353
WILL THRIVE AND TO LOOK FOR

26:28.420 --> 26:28.954
THOSE PEOPLE IS A VALUABLE

26:29.020 --> 26:30.989
EXERCISE.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.090
>> A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE ARE

26:32.157 --> 26:34.726
FOCUSING ON AVERAGE ONLY

26:34.793 --> 26:36.227
3 MINUTES OF WORK IS NOT GOING

26:36.294 --> 26:36.928
IN A GOOD DIRECTION.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.331
WHERE I DISAGREE WITH YOU --

26:39.397 --> 26:39.998
WHERE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE COMING

26:40.065 --> 26:42.968
FROM -- THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN

26:43.034 --> 26:44.636
START TO DO TO PUT THINGS RIGHT.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.937
>> Bill: WE COULD BUT WE

26:46.004 --> 26:46.338
DON'T.

26:46.404 --> 26:47.872
NOT USE THE PHONE AS MUCH, IT'S

26:47.939 --> 26:50.408
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.843
>> THERE ARE SOCIAL CHANGES AS

26:51.910 --> 26:52.177
WELL.

26:52.243 --> 26:56.614
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF

26:56.681 --> 26:57.082
DEFENSE.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.484
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM

26:59.551 --> 27:03.321
HISTORY, YOU REMEMBER THIS.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.924
>> Bill: SURE, BECAUSE WE ARE

27:05.991 --> 27:06.925
OLD.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.361
THAT'S A THING, WE REMEMBER

27:09.427 --> 27:10.895
STUFF.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.598
IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE ARE OLDER

27:13.665 --> 27:14.933
AND ACTUALLY SMARTER LIKE EVERY

27:15.000 --> 27:16.301
OTHER COUNTRY WOULD BELIEVE, BUT

27:16.368 --> 27:17.802
GO AHEAD.

27:17.869 --> 27:20.205
>> YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS,

27:20.271 --> 27:21.106
PEOPLE USED TO PUT LEADED

27:21.172 --> 27:23.174
GASOLINE IN THEIR CARS AND IT

27:23.241 --> 27:24.843
WAS DISCOVERED THAT PROFOUNDLY

27:24.909 --> 27:26.044
DAMAGED CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO

27:26.111 --> 27:27.145
FOCUS, EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS

27:27.212 --> 27:29.981
REALLY BAD FOR YOU.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.016
PEOPLE ADAPT, PEOPLE CHANGED, IT

27:31.082 --> 27:32.384
TURNED OUT THEY COULDN'T REALLY

27:32.450 --> 27:35.520
DAMAGED PEOPLE'S BRAINS.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.821
WHAT HAPPENED, ORDINARY MOMS

27:36.888 --> 27:37.389
BANDED TOGETHER AND SAID WE

27:37.455 --> 27:40.358
CAN'T TOLERATE THIS.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.893
THEY DIDN'T SAY LET'S BAN ALL

27:41.960 --> 27:43.161
GASOLINE, THEY SAID LET'S BAN

27:43.228 --> 27:46.398
THE LEAD IN THE GASOLINE.

27:46.464 --> 27:47.365
THAT THREAT TO OUR ATTENTION HAS

27:47.432 --> 27:48.366
BEEN DEALT WITH.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.801
WE NEED TO HAVE A SHIFT IN OUR

27:49.868 --> 27:50.602
PSYCHOLOGY.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.137
WE ARE NOT TO MEDIEVAL PEASANTS.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.573
>> Bill: THE GOVERNMENT DID

27:55.640 --> 27:56.207
THAT, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

27:56.274 --> 27:57.976
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

27:58.043 --> 27:58.643
>> Bill: DEMOCRATS IN

27:58.710 --> 28:01.446
GOVERNMENT PASSED THAT LAW.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.316
THAT'S WHEN GOVERNMENT WAS

28:05.383 --> 28:06.418
DIFFERENT, THAT'S WHEN

28:06.484 --> 28:08.887
REPUBLICANS WERE DIFFERENT,

28:08.953 --> 28:09.454
GEORGE BUSH THE FIRST --

28:09.521 --> 28:11.423
>> UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY IN

28:11.489 --> 28:15.160
GOVERNMENT IS PASSING MUCH OF

28:15.226 --> 28:15.593
ANYTHING THESE DAYS.

28:15.660 --> 28:15.860
[APPLAUSE]

28:15.927 --> 28:16.628
>> Bill: THE ENVIRONMENT DID

28:16.694 --> 28:20.532
NOT USED TO BE SOMETHING THE

28:20.598 --> 28:21.166
REPUBLICANS WERE AGAINST.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.602
>> WE HAVE TO RECLAIM OUR MINDS.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.237
WE ARE ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF

28:26.304 --> 28:27.205
MOVEMENTS THAT BANDED TOGETHER

28:27.272 --> 28:29.340
AND FOUGHT FOR THINGS IT SEEMED

28:29.407 --> 28:31.209
IMPOSSIBLE WHETHER IT'S WOMEN'S

28:31.276 --> 28:33.812
RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, I ARGUE WE

28:33.878 --> 28:35.346
HAVE TO HAVE AN ATTENTION

28:35.413 --> 28:36.981
MOVEMENT TO RECLAIM OUR MINDS.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.750
WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PSYCHOLOGY

28:38.817 --> 28:40.251
ABOUT THIS.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.754
WE ARE NOT MEDIEVAL PEASANTS

28:42.821 --> 28:44.189
LIVING AT THE PORT OF

28:44.255 --> 28:45.290
KING ZUCKERBERG BEGGING FOR

28:45.356 --> 28:46.391
CRUMBS OF ATTENTION FROM HIS

28:46.458 --> 28:47.692
TABLE.

28:47.759 --> 28:48.226
WHERE THE FREE CITIZENS OF

28:48.293 --> 28:51.529
DEMOCRACIES AND WE CAN

28:51.596 --> 28:51.796
RECLAIM --

28:51.863 --> 28:52.397
>> Bill: I'M GLAD EVERYBODY IS

28:52.464 --> 28:56.334
SO OPTIMISTIC."

28:56.401 --> 28:57.702
>> IF WE DON'T FIGHT --

28:57.769 --> 29:00.905
>> Bill: I HEAR YOUR POINT.

29:00.972 --> 29:01.172
[LAUGHTER]

29:01.239 --> 29:05.143
THIS IS WHY I DON'T -- LET ME

29:05.210 --> 29:06.978
PUT IT THIS WAY, I'M SKEPTICAL

29:07.045 --> 29:08.780
OF THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.181
IT WOULDN'T IF WE SPENT,

29:10.248 --> 29:11.182
JOE MANCHIN THIS WEEK SAID IT'S

29:11.249 --> 29:14.853
DEAD AND IT HAS BEEN DEAD FOR A

29:14.919 --> 29:15.053
WHILE.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.622
EVEN IF WE COULD, IF WE SPENT

29:17.689 --> 29:21.860
THAT KIND OF MONEY, DO I HAVE

29:21.926 --> 29:23.194
ANY CONFIDENCE THAT MONEY WOULD

29:23.261 --> 29:25.930
GO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO?

29:25.997 --> 29:27.932
I WAS READING THIS, THE

29:27.999 --> 29:28.399
NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY,

29:28.466 --> 29:31.202
SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY COST

29:31.269 --> 29:34.405
$2.6 BILLION PER MILE.

29:34.472 --> 29:40.645
THEY DID IT IN PARIS FOR

29:40.712 --> 29:42.380
$160 MILLION.

29:42.447 --> 29:42.614
6.15%.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.582
THAT'S ONE REASON WE CAN'T GET

29:44.649 --> 29:44.916
ANYTHING DONE.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.118
>> I WILL JOIN YOU IN DESPAIR

29:47.185 --> 29:47.318
HERE.

29:47.385 --> 29:48.753
WE ARE IN A CATASTROPHIC

29:48.820 --> 29:50.755
SITUATION IN TERMS OF JUST THE

29:50.822 --> 29:53.124
VERY BASIC DOING OF STUFF IN

29:53.191 --> 29:54.125
THIS COUNTRY, AND I THINK

29:54.192 --> 29:57.695
CONGRESS IS A BIG PART OF THAT.

29:57.762 --> 29:58.363
UNFORTUNATELY THE INFRASTRUCTURE

29:58.429 --> 30:00.431
BILL IS GOING TO BE ABOUT IT FOR

30:00.498 --> 30:02.800
WHAT THEY DO, CERTAINLY BUILD

30:02.867 --> 30:07.205
BACK BETTER IS MOSTLY DOOMED.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.641
WE SPENT THIS $1.2 TRILLION ON

30:09.707 --> 30:10.008
INFRASTRUCTURE.

30:10.074 --> 30:13.011
FIRST OF ALL WE CAN'T SPEND THAT

30:13.077 --> 30:13.611
MONEY BECAUSE CONGRESS HASN'T

30:13.678 --> 30:15.747
PROPERLY APPROPRIATED IT.

30:15.813 --> 30:17.048
IT NEEDS A CONTINUING

30:17.115 --> 30:18.816
RESOLUTION -- ANYWAY, IT'S SUPER

30:18.883 --> 30:21.286
BORING.

30:21.352 --> 30:22.287
[LAUGHTER]

30:22.353 --> 30:23.188
EVEN IF THAT MONEY WAS READY TO

30:23.254 --> 30:26.558
BE SPENT IN THIS COUNTRY, WE

30:26.624 --> 30:28.560
CANNOT TURN DOLLARS INTO

30:28.626 --> 30:30.528
INFRASTRUCTURE.

30:30.595 --> 30:30.962
IT IS EXPENSIVE.

30:31.029 --> 30:31.896
>> Bill: WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

30:31.963 --> 30:34.265
ENOUGH WORKERS FOR THE COFFEE

30:34.332 --> 30:36.768
SHOPS.

30:36.834 --> 30:42.674
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30:42.740 --> 30:45.076
>> THAT'S TRUE, WE CAN'T GET A

30:45.143 --> 30:46.377
LATTE SO BUILDING A HIGHWAY IS

30:46.444 --> 30:46.578
HARD.

30:46.644 --> 30:49.147
THE INPUTS ARE PART OF THE

30:49.214 --> 30:50.448
PROBLEM BUT THE BIGGEST PART OF

30:50.515 --> 30:53.685
THE PROBLEM IS THE NOT IN MY

30:53.751 --> 30:55.987
BACKYARD, PEOPLE GET A VETO ON

30:56.054 --> 30:58.089
WHAT CAN BE BUILT.

30:58.156 --> 30:58.656
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, OTHER

30:58.723 --> 31:00.491
REGULATIONS AND OF COURSE

31:00.558 --> 31:01.859
CORRUPTION AND ALL MANNER OF

31:01.926 --> 31:04.095
LOBBYING TO PUT THIS MONEY

31:04.162 --> 31:04.329
PLACES.

31:04.395 --> 31:04.896
>> Bill: EVERYBODY HAS THEIR

31:04.963 --> 31:06.598
HAND OUT.

31:06.664 --> 31:11.469
WHY DOES IT COST PARIS

31:11.536 --> 31:13.271
160 MILLION AND US 2.15 BILLION

31:13.338 --> 31:18.042
FOR THE SAME THING?

31:18.109 --> 31:19.477
>> D.C. IS AWASH IN LOBBYISTS

31:19.544 --> 31:21.879
WHO ARE TRYING TO GRAB A LITTLE

31:21.946 --> 31:22.313
BIT.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.816
>> THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THIS

31:24.882 --> 31:25.450
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL BECAUSE THEY

31:25.516 --> 31:28.419
ARE TWO KINDS OF FOUNDATIONS

31:28.486 --> 31:28.853
COLLAPSING.

31:28.920 --> 31:29.487
THE PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE

31:29.554 --> 31:32.090
COUNTRY DRIVING ALL AROUND THE

31:32.156 --> 31:33.791
COUNTRY RESEARCHING MY BOOKS,

31:33.858 --> 31:35.193
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO

31:35.260 --> 31:36.060
SHIT.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.295
THE ROADS, BRIDGES, BROADBAND.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.431
IF WE DON'T FIX THEM WE DON'T

31:40.498 --> 31:40.898
HAVE A COUNTRY.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.001
ALSO THE POLITICAL

31:43.067 --> 31:45.536
INFRASTRUCTURE.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.306
YOU DOCUMENTED THIS SO WELL,

31:48.373 --> 31:50.475
PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR FAITH IN

31:50.541 --> 31:51.042
DEMOCRACY.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.010
BERNIE SANDERS IS RIGHT WHEN HE

31:52.076 --> 31:54.212
SAYS THE BEST WAY TO RESTORE

31:54.279 --> 31:55.847
FAITH IN DEMOCRACY IS TO SHOW

31:55.913 --> 31:57.081
THAT THE SYSTEM CAN DELIVER

31:57.148 --> 31:59.684
SOMETHING FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.585
WE ARE GETTING PESSIMISTIC HERE

32:00.652 --> 32:02.186
AND THERE IS LOTS OF REASONS TO

32:02.253 --> 32:03.488
BE PESSIMISTIC BUT LET'S THINK

32:03.554 --> 32:03.988
ABOUT A GREAT THING THE

32:04.055 --> 32:05.990
GOVERNMENT DID.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.326
THEY DID OF CHILD TAX CREDIT,

32:08.393 --> 32:12.697
$300 ALL THE PANDEMIC, THAT HAS

32:12.764 --> 32:13.231
HALVED CHILD POVERTY.

IN THE MAIL?

32:19.137 --> 32:19.937
THAT'S NOT DOING A LOT.

32:20.004 --> 32:20.805

I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

32:24.842 --> 32:26.811
DONE IT BUT IT'S NOT BUILDING

32:48.433 --> 32:50.201
NEED TO MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL

32:50.268 --> 32:53.037

HAVE GIVEN UP THAT THE STATE HAS

32:57.842 --> 33:01.412
GOING TO GET ITSELF SORTED OUT.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.206
THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG WITH

36:15.273 --> 36:16.240
CHINA AND YET THERE IS AN ISSUE

36:16.307 --> 36:19.243
THAT CONFUSES THE WOKE.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.580
BECAUSE CHINESE OR ASIANS AND

36:22.647 --> 36:25.216
ASIANS ARE NOT WHITE, SO IF YOU

36:25.283 --> 36:28.319
CRITICIZE THEM IT'S RACIST.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.936

36:45.002 --> 36:46.170
EXTENSIVELY AND IT'S NOT ONLY

36:46.237 --> 36:47.772
TROUBLING ON ITS OWN MERITS,

36:47.838 --> 36:49.707
IT'S TROUBLING BECAUSE IT'S A

37:07.425 --> 37:08.492
SHOCKING.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.361
I THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR THE U.S.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.662
TO SPEAK UP AGAINST THAT.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.031
I WONDER WHY IT IS THAT SUDDENLY

37:14.098 --> 37:14.665
IT'S THE OLYMPICS AND WE SHOULD

37:14.732 --> 37:18.069
SOLVE IT TODAY.

37:18.135 --> 37:21.272
THAT SHOULD BE AN ALWAYS PROBLE

37:21.339 --> 37:23.307

37:28.379 --> 37:30.448

37:30.514 --> 37:31.515
THE DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTTS -- I

37:31.582 --> 37:33.751
FRANKLY LOVE TO GO TO EVENTS

37:33.818 --> 37:36.854
THAT POLITICIANS REFUSE TO COME

37:36.921 --> 37:39.590
TO, IT SOUNDS LIKE WAY MORE FUN.

37:39.657 --> 37:40.157
THERE ARE DEFINITELY BETTER

37:40.224 --> 37:43.761
DRUGS AT THOSE AND

37:43.828 --> 37:44.395
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS OR

37:44.462 --> 37:46.864
OTHERWISE I GUESS.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.132
I THINK THERE'S AT LEAST A CASE

37:48.199 --> 37:51.035
TO BE MADE FOR THE OLYMPICS, SET

37:51.102 --> 37:52.903
THE POLITICS ASIDE, LET THE

ATHLETES COMPETE AND EVERYBODY

37:53.738 --> 37:55.506

9036 OLYMPICS.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.188
CHINA IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN

40:52.516 --> 40:53.684
THAT SHOW HAS SPACE.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.720
WHEN WHOOPI SAID WHAT SHE SAID,

40:56.787 --> 40:57.922
THERE WAS PUSHBACK FROM OTHER

40:57.988 --> 40:58.189
PANELISTS.

40:58.255 --> 40:59.657
THEY WERE LIKE I DON'T THINK

40:59.723 --> 41:00.558
THAT MIGHT BE RIGHT.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.226
THAT'S IT FROM A MISSION

41:02.293 --> 41:04.061
ACCOMPLISHED WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.496
>> Bill: CAN WE UNDERSTAND

41:05.563 --> 41:07.898
THAT PART OF OUR "RACIAL

41:07.965 --> 41:10.034
HISTORY" IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE

41:10.100 --> 41:11.001
POINT OF VIEW FROM A BLACK

41:11.068 --> 41:13.637
PERSON IS OFTEN GOING TO BE VERY

41:13.704 --> 41:14.305
DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES SHOCKING

41:14.371 --> 41:16.807
TO A WHITE PERSON.

41:16.874 --> 41:19.844
I PULLED A QUOTE FROM WHEN

41:19.910 --> 41:21.478
WHOOPI DEFENDED MICHAEL VICK,

41:21.545 --> 41:24.715
REMEMBER THE FOOTBALL PLAYER WHO

41:24.782 --> 41:26.183
WAS ELECTROCUTING DOGS?

41:26.250 --> 41:28.686
I'M A LIFELONG PETA BOARD

41:28.752 --> 41:31.222
MEMBER.

41:31.288 --> 41:35.392
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

41:35.459 --> 41:37.194
ALSO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT

41:37.261 --> 41:39.964
NAZIS WERE VERY RACIST.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.832
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT

41:41.899 --> 41:43.033
MICHAEL VICK.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.301
"HE'S FROM THE SOUTH, THIS IS

41:44.368 --> 41:45.669
PART OF HIS CULTURAL UPBRINGING.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.671
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, DOGS ARE

41:47.738 --> 41:48.439
SUPPORT.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.074
INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING HE'S A

41:50.140 --> 41:51.375
BEAST AND A MONSTER, THIS IS A

41:51.442 --> 41:52.843
KID WHO COMES FROM A CULTURE

41:52.910 --> 41:55.446
WHERE THIS IS NOT QUESTIONED."

41:55.512 --> 41:56.647
YOU SEE THE POINT HERE?

41:56.714 --> 41:57.281
I DON'T AGREE WITH HER ON

41:57.348 --> 42:00.451
MICHAEL VICK BUT WE GREW UP IN

42:00.517 --> 42:03.687
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS, WHICH THE

42:03.754 --> 42:04.455
WHITE PEOPLE IMPOSED ON THE

42:04.521 --> 42:06.590
BLACK PEOPLE.

42:06.657 --> 42:07.524
THEY ARE GOING TO SOMETIMES HAVE

42:07.591 --> 42:09.960
A VERY DIFFERENT OPINION.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.762
THE ANSWER IS NOT TO MAKE THEM

42:11.829 --> 42:14.198
SIT IN A CORNER FOR TWO WEEKS,

42:14.265 --> 42:16.033
THAT IS INSULTING, IT'S SO

42:16.100 --> 42:18.269
INSULTING TO MAKE A

42:18.335 --> 42:19.737
65-YEAR-OLD -- THE PERSON AT

42:19.803 --> 42:21.405
"ABC NEWS" SAID I ASKED HER TO

42:22.773 --> 42:25.042
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HER

42:25.109 --> 42:26.043

42:26.110 --> 42:27.778
HOW INSULTING FOR SOMEONE OF HER

42:27.845 --> 42:29.113

42:29.179 --> 42:30.447
PERSON AND THE IMPACT OF HER

42:30.514 --> 42:30.714
COMMENTS.

42:30.781 --> 42:32.383
THERE IS NO IMPACT.

42:32.449 --> 42:36.086
THERE ARE TWO NEO-NAZIS WAITING

42:36.153 --> 42:37.621
FOR THE GREEN LIGHT FROM THE

42:37.688 --> 42:38.422

42:38.489 --> 42:41.792

42:45.296 --> 42:46.964
FREE SPEECH WHEN WE ARE RIGHT,

42:47.031 --> 42:47.831
WE NEED TO FREE SPEECH WHEN WE

42:47.898 --> 42:48.832
ARE WRONG.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.268
WE NEED FREE SPEECH TO MAKE

MISTAKES AND SAY REALLY

42:52.169 --> 42:53.003
UNPOPULAR THINGS.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.438
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M ALWAYS

PROUD TO COME ON THIS SHOW AND I

42:56.073 --> 42:58.542
BET YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY, THIS

42:58.609 --> 42:59.877

JEFF ZUCKER A POWERFUL, HEAD OF

CNN RESIGNED BECAUSE HE'S 56 AND

44:03.707 --> 44:04.308
HE WAS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP

44:04.375 --> 44:08.479
WITH A 49-YEAR-OLD, I THINK THAT

44:08.545 --> 44:09.179

44:09.246 --> 44:12.616
THAT CHECK FOR HIM.
