WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:07.541
This is so exciting
being in L.A.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.044
I already feel like
I'm tanner, thinner,

00:10.078 --> 00:11.379
and that I have
to hide my homosexuality

00:11.412 --> 00:13.214
to be cast
as a leading man.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.319
Hey, look, all the people in
this hotel are looking at me.

00:18.352 --> 00:22.056
They probably think I'm someone
super famous checking in.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.092
Excuse me.
Are you--

00:24.125 --> 00:26.427
Nicole Kidman?
No.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.230
I was going
to say Kathy Griffin.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.638
I'll take it.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.208
Elliot, hold those bags
a little higher.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.542
When we were walking
by the gutter

00:41.575 --> 00:43.444
you almost hit Colin Farrell
in the head.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.315
Oh, Elliot,
you must be so excited.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.450
I can't believe you
might be going to UCLA.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.618
It just seems like yesterday

00:50.651 --> 00:53.154
you were playing
with a GI Joe doll

00:53.187 --> 00:55.589
and spilling your juice box
on our rug.

00:55.623 --> 00:59.593
That was yesterday.
And it was Jack.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.095
No, but it's so cool
of you and Will

01:01.129 --> 01:01.995
to come check out
UCLA with us.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.098
Of course, Elliot.
We wouldn't miss it.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.333
You're family.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.468
You wanna come next month when
we check out University Kansas?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.237
Oh God, no.
What celebrities live there?

01:09.270 --> 01:12.640
Truman and Adler checking in.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.608
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.
Move it, move it.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.411
Me first.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.581
Hello, Mr. "I moved here
to become an actor, failed,

01:20.614 --> 01:22.883
and then decided that working
in a hotel is really

01:22.916 --> 01:25.219
what I wanted to do after all."

01:25.253 --> 01:27.555
Karen Walker
checking in.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.292
I reserved the entire eighth
floor and bungalow two.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.894
I'm like a doggie.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.666
I can't poo
in my own cage.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.501
The bellman
will see you upstairs.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.503
Jack, you think
we could go up to the room?

01:42.536 --> 01:44.205
I wanna be early
for our campus tour.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.406
Yeah, you're
gonna love our room.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.208
I requested a view
of the Hollywood Hills.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.145
So if it rains, we can watch all
the houses slide down the hill.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.518
All right.
Let's go.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.254
Oh my God.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.724
That looked like James.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.259
Remember the guy that I met

02:05.293 --> 02:06.527
the night of The Sound of Music
sing-along?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.329
Will, you've gotta stop.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.598
You've thought you've seen
this James guy, like,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.333
ten times in the last month.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.768
He was not in line
at Dean and DeLucca.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.372
He was not our pilot
who flew us out here.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.307
And he was definitely not

02:19.340 --> 02:22.243
cured of blindness
on that Christian station.

02:24.212 --> 02:27.781
I know, it's just I wish
I'd got his last name

02:27.815 --> 02:28.782
or his phone number.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.718
I've been back at that theatre,
like, six times

02:30.751 --> 02:31.919
hoping to run into him again.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.389
I actually had to buy a ticket
to Big Mama's House II.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.724
Had to?

02:36.757 --> 02:40.694
You've been quoting lines
from that movie all week.

02:40.728 --> 02:46.234
Mama's gonna dole out some
justice up in here.

02:46.267 --> 02:50.604
Are our rooms next
to each other?
Yes, they are.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.440
Could they not be?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.345
Will?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.480
James?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.648
Oh my God.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.782
It is you.

03:01.815 --> 03:05.219
Hey, wow.
This is so bizarre.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.454
What are you doing out here?

03:06.487 --> 03:07.788
I'm on vacation.
What are you doing here?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.457
I'm working.
I'm a photographer.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.624
You wanna go get
a drink?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.825
Uh, yeah.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.262
I can't--
this is so weird.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.331
I swear, for the last month,
I've been seeing you everywhere.
Me too.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.633
I actually thought I saw you
at Williams-Sonoma

03:19.667 --> 03:21.302
trying on bunny rabbit
oven mitts.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.803
[laughter]

03:22.836 --> 03:24.438
That was me.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.353
Karen, have you seen Elliot?
I'm worried sick.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.988
He went out
to a party last night

03:41.021 --> 03:42.656
with some kids he met
on the campus tour

03:42.690 --> 03:43.657
and stayed out all night.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.427
Well, honey, that's not good.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.264
I can tell you he wasn't
at the Phi Theta Moo house.

03:50.298 --> 03:55.736
Fun party, more like
the "I felt a thigh" house.

03:55.769 --> 04:00.908
I did a beer bong and cuddled
with a girl named Lindsey.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.909
Hey, guys.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.010
Oh, Elliot.
Thank God.

04:03.043 --> 04:03.977
Where were you?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.913
I wanna know exactly
where you were last night.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.917
I went to some parties with some
people and did some stuff.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.886
Oh, okay, now that I know the
details, I feel so much better.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.323
I'm gonna go crash.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.492
Honey, what the hell
was that?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.560
Oh, you saw that?

04:19.593 --> 04:23.897
I had to pull my pants out of my
butt a little bit.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.868
No!
Elliot owes you an explanation.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.969
Jackie, you're his father.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.338
You better start acting
like one.

04:30.371 --> 04:34.342
Well, it's hard.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.976
It's a very complicated
relationship

04:36.009 --> 04:38.779
between a sperm donor dad
and the child of a lesbian

04:38.812 --> 04:42.350
who shows up on his door
13 years later.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.452
There's really
only one book about it.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
And not a lot of stores carry

04:45.953 --> 04:50.924
Yank, Squirt, Doink,
Dike, Baby.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.093
I know, honey.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.996
All I'm saying is that Elliot's
gonna be going away

04:56.029 --> 04:58.532
to college next year.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.101
Soon he won't be around
for you to protect him.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.838
And help him
to make the right choices.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.774
So, now while you
go talk to him,

05:06.807 --> 05:09.377
I'm gonna run back
to the Phi Theta Moo house

05:09.410 --> 05:12.780
and teach Lindsey that you
only have to use condoms

05:12.813 --> 05:14.815
if he's ugly, okay?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.422
Hey, look at that couple.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.425
The one guy is so much cuter
than the other guy.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.994
Mismatch.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.128
Oh, look, they're pointing
at us too.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.099
Stop looking at them.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.901
You wanna go
in the pool?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
Oh, can I put my ring
in your shoe?

05:35.936 --> 05:39.840
I don't know what that entails,
but sure, I'm game.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.075
My engagement ring.
Oh!

05:42.109 --> 05:44.478
I'm sorry,
your engagement what?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.146
It's for my green card.
I'm Canadian.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.848
And my friend Claire
offered to marry me

05:47.881 --> 05:49.750
so that I could stay
in the country.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.919
Wow, that is
so sweet of her.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.488
My friend Grace
won't even flush the toilet.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.890
Come on.
Let's get in.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.127
Okay.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.464
You know, I'll be
in there in a second.

06:03.497 --> 06:08.035
I just got a bit
of a cramp.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.006
There you are.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.141
Thank you.

06:14.174 --> 06:17.911
Thank you for making me go
to Grauman's Chinese Theatre

06:17.945 --> 06:19.112
all by myself.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.481
I looked like an idiot
standing

06:20.514 --> 06:23.150
in John Wayne's
footprints alone.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.153
Because your feet
are bigger?

06:26.186 --> 06:30.958
And my hands.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.494
Was he tiny,
or am I just a monster?

06:33.527 --> 06:36.864
Look.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.632
The reason
that I blew you off,

06:38.666 --> 06:41.502
remember that guy that I thought
was James in the lobby?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.503
It was him.

06:42.536 --> 06:46.039
And he is amazing.
Where is he?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.140
Introduce me.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.611
Nah, maybe later.

06:50.644 --> 06:55.048
What's the matter?
You think I'm gonna turn him?

06:55.082 --> 06:58.418
Turn him?
He's already gay.

06:59.987 --> 07:04.925
No, I just--I wanna have him
to myself for a little while.

07:04.958 --> 07:05.926
You understand.
Right?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.194
What's the big deal?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.862
You just met him
like two days ago.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.964
Yeah, but don't you see?

07:10.998 --> 07:13.867
We meet in New York,
then a month later

07:13.901 --> 07:15.969
we run into each other
in L.A.

07:16.003 --> 07:16.970
It's fate.

07:17.004 --> 07:21.675
No, fate is me
signing Kathy Griffin autographs

07:21.709 --> 07:27.548
for ten bucks a pop and running
into her doing the same thing.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.117
I'm serious, I think this is
the beginning of something.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.519
Oh, Will, I don't know.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.986
It sounds like
you're moving a little fast.

07:33.020 --> 07:33.987
I know
what I'm doing.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.155
Hurry up.
Get out of here.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.524
He's getting
out of the pool.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.626
All right, fine.
I'll go.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.893
Is that him?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.929
Yeah.
Mismatch.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.035
I had such a good time
last night.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.236
I tried sushi.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.104
I climbed on this roof
and chipped my tooth

07:51.138 --> 07:52.105
on a satellite dish.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.273
Then I did a beer bong

07:53.306 --> 07:57.010
and cuddled
with a girl named Lindsey.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.980
We really need
to talk about last night.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.248
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.
I can't.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.617
And I also can't go to the beach
with you later.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.619
Some of the guys called,
and they wanna hang out.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.188
Well, just a second.
You should have called me.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.624
I was up all night
watching Telemundo

08:10.658 --> 08:12.693
and worrying myself sick.

08:12.726 --> 08:16.530
I'm sorry.
Look, I gotta go.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.565
No-no-no.
You can't.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.599
What?

08:18.632 --> 08:22.970
You behaved irresponsibly,
so you're grounded.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.206
That's funny.
I'll see ya later.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.208
I'm not kidding.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.309
I am not spending another night

08:29.342 --> 08:33.681
watching Spanish soap operas
wondering where my son is.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.683
Now you are going to sit here

08:35.716 --> 08:41.021
and think about what you
are wearing tomorrow.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.023
You're not the guy
who tells me what to do.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.324
Yes, I am.
I am your father.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.093
And If I say you're not going,
you're not going.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.062
My father?
All you did was donate sperm.

08:49.096 --> 08:53.333
You're not dad.
You're Jack.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.102
Elliot.
I'm going out.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.170
Elliot!

08:57.204 --> 09:01.141
[speaking Spanish]

09:04.077 --> 09:05.178
I just realized
I do know your work.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.616
You took that photograph,
that amazing shot of Kate Moss

09:08.649 --> 09:11.318
in the dumpster with the
lettuce leaf on her head.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.653
That was genius.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.221
Actually,
I can't take credit.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.624
I found her like that.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.259
Mr. Hanson, you have
a phone call at the front desk.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.295
I'll order us drinks.
All right.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.732
Mismatch.

09:24.765 --> 09:31.304
Excuse me, that was Kathy
Griffin I saw you with.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.706
Could you get me
her autograph?

09:32.740 --> 09:36.076
Sure.
It's ten bucks.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.179
Ah, it's for my niece.
I'll do it myself.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.317
Hey, everything okay?

09:44.351 --> 09:45.318
Actually, no.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.287
That was Claire.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.658
Apparently she met somebody.
Now she doesn't wanna marry me.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.692
I don't get it.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.327
She's not pretty,
smart, or funny.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.397
I really thought this was
a full-proof plan.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.334
So what does this mean?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.736
It means I have
to leave the country.

10:02.770 --> 10:07.407
Oh.
When do you have to go?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.376
My Visa expires
in four days.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.113
Crap.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.048
So I did those push-ups
for nothing.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.957
Thanks a lot, Karen.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.660
I took your advice
and tried to be a dad to Elliot.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.395
And we ended up
having a huge fight.

10:28.428 --> 10:32.232
He said I wasn't really his
father, and he stormed off.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.968
[speaking Spanish]

10:36.970 --> 10:39.006
Oh, honey.
He didn't mean it.

10:39.039 --> 10:43.677
Mason and Olivia say the most
horrible things about me.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.446
And sometimes
to the police.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.717
No, he did mean it.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.353
And maybe he's right.
I'm not his father.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.822
Jackie, listen.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.057
Every parent
goes through this.

10:57.090 --> 11:02.830
When I lost Mason in Egypt
for four weeks,

11:02.863 --> 11:05.298
I'll be honest,
I doubted myself.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.101
I didn't think there was any way

11:08.135 --> 11:11.304
that he would ever again think
that I was a good mother.

11:11.338 --> 11:18.378
But when he rang our doorbell
that day, covered in stickers,

11:18.411 --> 11:20.848
all was forgiven.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.051
Jackie, trust me.
You're a good father.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.954
[cell phone]
* You can ring my bell

11:26.987 --> 11:28.055
Honey, what's that?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.389
It's my cell phone.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.423
Oh.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.994
* Ding a ling my bell

11:34.027 --> 11:35.495
It's a cool ring tone,
honey.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.731
Thanks, I miss a lot of calls

11:37.765 --> 11:40.000
because I like to get all the
way to the ding-a-ling-a-lings.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.137
* You can ring my bell
ring my bell *

11:44.171 --> 11:48.475
* My bell
Ring a my bell *

11:48.508 --> 11:49.843
Oh, it's Elliot.
Oh, it's Elliot!

11:49.877 --> 11:51.879
Oh, hello, Elliot.
Hello.

11:51.912 --> 11:55.148
Oh, yeah, okay.
Just a second.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.384
He wants
to talk to you.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.888
What can I do
for you, Smelliot?

12:00.921 --> 12:04.524
Uh-huh.
Okay, bye.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.159
He's stranded,
and he needs a ride.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.429
Oh, well where is he at?
I'll go get him.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.765
Honey, he wants me to go.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.836
I'm sorry, Jackie.
I feel awful.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.971
Me too.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.842
* You can ring my bell...

12:25.946 --> 12:28.015
Oh my God.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.783
You've gotta come downstairs
and see this.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.419
Tara Reid dropped
her martini in the pool,

12:32.452 --> 12:34.087
and now she's drinking
the water.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.790
Come on.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.458
Are you packing?

12:38.491 --> 12:39.860
Yes.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.795
For fun, or are you
really packing?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.964
Do I look like I'm having fun?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.900
Kinda.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.502
Well, that's because I'm using
my shirt board,

12:49.536 --> 12:52.505
and that always makes me
a little happy.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.440
I'm going home, Grace.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.876
James' green card marriage
fell through,

12:55.909 --> 12:57.510
and now he has
to go back to Canada.

12:57.544 --> 13:01.815
Oh, how awful
for him.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.951
Those Canadians are so smug

13:03.984 --> 13:07.387
with their health care
and their gay rights.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.557
It's easy to be like that
when you're not a real country.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.526
Did you hear
what I said?

13:13.560 --> 13:14.561
James and I are over.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.097
Oh God.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.166
The one time that
I don't over think something.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.534
The one time
that I take a chance,

13:21.568 --> 13:22.469
and this is what happens.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.206
Will, I'm sorry,
but it was gonna end anyway.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.542
I mean, that's what happens
with a fling.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.444
This was not a fling.

13:31.478 --> 13:36.416
Will, I am sure that James
is a really great guy.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.118
But you've only known him
a couple of days.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.087
And you're on vacation.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.555
Maybe you just
got caught up a little.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.625
Grace, you know me.
I don't get caught up.

13:45.658 --> 13:50.630
I'm, like, the one gay man I
know that never got highlights.

13:50.663 --> 13:55.969
I mean, I cover the gray.
I'm not a caveman.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.038
You know, I mean, maybe
we could have had something.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.541
You know, and now we'll never
have a chance to find out.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.876
Does he feel
the same way?

14:02.910 --> 14:06.546
Yes...I think.
How could he not?

14:06.579 --> 14:07.647
See, you don't
even know.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.151
Why don't you
just slow down,

14:11.184 --> 14:16.189
enjoy the next two days,
and then see where you are.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.225
I can't.

14:18.258 --> 14:22.162
I don't wanna go any further
down a dead-end road.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.968
Uh, there you are.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.570
I got lost and had to stop
at a bar for directions.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.506
I couldn't understand one thing
anybody said.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.208
The gay accent is so thick here.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.045
Well, what are you doing here?
I thought Karen was coming.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.614
Well, you got me whether
you want me or not, Elliot.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.550
So come on.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.218
No, I do want you,
I only called Karen

14:45.252 --> 14:46.553
because I didn't think
you'd come

14:46.586 --> 14:47.687
after all the things I said.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.625
Elliot, if you need me,
I'll always come and get you.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.929
It doesn't matter what awful
things you say to me.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.664
Or how long you insist
on keeping

14:57.697 --> 15:00.167
that Keira Knightley haircut.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.703
You're my son.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.572
Now tell me exactly
what happened tonight?

15:05.605 --> 15:08.575
These guys,
they wanted me to go

15:08.608 --> 15:10.944
to the ATM to get money
so we could get beer.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
And after I gave it to them,

15:12.745 --> 15:17.250
they just drove off
laughing and flipping me off.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.987
I'm starting to think
I got ditched.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.590
I once got ditched too.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.327
I was in high school, and it
involved an actual ditch.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.964
Still be there if that police
dog hadn't picked up my scent.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.599
All part of growing up.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.967
Come on.
Let's go.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.703
Wait, Jack.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.670
I'm sorry.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.273
I shouldn't have said
that you weren't my dad.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.077
Anyway, isn't it weird
that all this happened

15:44.111 --> 15:45.712
right when you're
about to go to college,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.647
and you don't even need
a dad anymore.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.652
Well, maybe
I still kinda do.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.654
Yeah, we can't hug here.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.324
We're on the corner
of murder and homophobia.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.063
So we'll be
checking out early.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.999
And, oh, just so you know,
I had a break in.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.036
They cleared out
the mini bar.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.705
They didn't take the fruit

16:12.739 --> 16:18.378
or the other half
of that weird granola thing.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.479
That's strange.
Yeah.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.782
Oh, and also another thing you
should know is that, um,

16:22.815 --> 16:27.120
there was no coffee machine
when I checked in.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.699
Do you mind if I sit?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.135
No.
Go ahead.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.675
Wow, you really are
handsome.

16:48.708 --> 16:53.046
I'm sorry.
I should tell you that I'm gay.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.715
Oh, yeah.
I got that.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.152
You're reading Gourmet Magazine
and ripping out recipes.

16:59.186 --> 17:03.190
Um, look--
I don't mean
to sound rude.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.325
But I really don't feel
like talking right now.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.626
Oh, I see.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.061
I mean, what am I gonna say?

17:08.095 --> 17:10.063
I can't be all
broken-hearted

17:10.097 --> 17:12.065
over a guy I've known
for two days.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.167
Even if he is great.
I mean, I had to--

17:14.201 --> 17:15.735
I'm sorry.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.704
I'm taking up
all your time,

17:17.737 --> 17:24.811
and clearly you've got
money to make, so...

17:24.844 --> 17:31.651
Wait, you think I'm a hooker?

17:31.684 --> 17:35.088
I'll take that.

17:39.259 --> 17:43.130
It's just that it sucks.
You know?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.731
I thought this could
really be something.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.501
And now I'm not gonna get
a chance to find out.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.871
Well, what if it was only meant
to be a fun weekend?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.741
How much do you
even know about him?

17:54.774 --> 18:00.413
Well, I know that his favorite
color is antique paper.

18:00.447 --> 18:05.385
And that he calls
his shirt board Vladimere.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.487
He knows all the lyrics
to Walking On Sunshine,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.323
which is a bummer,
but I can get over it.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.792
That's how much
I like him.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.128
I mean, I haven't met a guy
like that in so long,

18:15.162 --> 18:19.132
who seemed honest
and real and kind--

18:19.166 --> 18:19.932
He is.

18:19.966 --> 18:24.904
And he feels the same way
about you.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.274
I'm Grace,
by the way.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.277
Oh, Will told me
you were funny.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.878
Sweet.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.714
That's why I didn't think
it was you.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.752
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, um,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.354
Will's pretty miserable too.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.422
He's upstairs packing.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.793
For real or for fun?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.762
For real.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.902
What are you doing?

18:55.935 --> 18:58.338
Checking out.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.541
I was gonna come say good-bye
after I finished making the bed.

19:01.574 --> 19:05.578
You make your hotel bed too?
So do I.

19:05.612 --> 19:10.383
It just got harder
to leave you.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.784
You guys,
I have something to say.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.286
This is not
a good time, Grace.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.454
Yeah, but what if--
Grace, please.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.755
I'm trying
to say good-bye here.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.556
I don't wanna say good-bye.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.191
Well, I don't
wanna say it either,

19:18.225 --> 19:20.193
but I don't see
what else there is to do.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.461
I do.
What if I--

19:21.494 --> 19:23.563
What if you what, Grace?

19:23.596 --> 19:25.798
What are you gonna do
that's gonna magically solve

19:25.832 --> 19:27.767
this miserable
and hopeless situation?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.202
What if I marry James?

19:29.236 --> 19:32.605
Yeah, that would solve it.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.808
You're not serious.
No, no, Grace, that's crazy.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.578
Why?

19:38.611 --> 19:42.349
I mean, you guys clearly
have something here.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.818
You deserve to see where
this relationship could go.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.889
Are you sure?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.359
It's only two years.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.993
What have I done
in the last two years?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.629
I can't think of one thing.

19:56.663 --> 20:00.567
That's true.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.371
She didn't even read
The Da Vinci Code.

20:04.404 --> 20:09.208
So what do you say, James?

20:14.681 --> 20:18.251
Will you marry me?

20:18.285 --> 20:19.619
Yes.
Yes, I will.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.262
Hey, may I kiss the bride?

20:29.296 --> 20:30.830
Yes.

20:40.707 --> 20:40.773
Mismatch.
