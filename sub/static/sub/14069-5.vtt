WEBVTT

00:01.536 --> 00:03.002
I just heard you turned down a client

00:03.038 --> 00:05.359
whose investment firm
is worth $2 billion.

00:05.459 --> 00:06.238
Well, I don't give a shit
how much they're worth.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.709
I'm not representing William Sutter.

00:08.953 --> 00:09.752
I didn't kill anyone.

00:10.529 --> 00:12.162
I've been saying it for 12 years,

00:12.197 --> 00:13.997
and I can prove it.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.999
Do you want to take a
chance on each other or not?

00:16.035 --> 00:17.568
I just got a visit from Sean Cahill.

00:17.603 --> 00:20.003
It turns out there's a
way he can get you out.

00:20.039 --> 00:21.204
What's the catch?

00:21.239 --> 00:23.006
He needs you to inform
on your cellmate.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.042
- Tell me the truth.
- He said no.

00:25.077 --> 00:26.810
But Sean, I'm telling
you, he'll come around.

00:26.845 --> 00:28.078
Do you know how many strings I pulled

00:28.113 --> 00:29.746
to put this thing in motion?

00:29.782 --> 00:31.181
You're gonna get me out
of here like you promised.

00:31.216 --> 00:32.381
I never promised...

00:32.417 --> 00:33.917
Six weeks, brother,

00:33.953 --> 00:35.552
and if I find out you're screwing me,

00:35.588 --> 00:38.388
you better hole up in some
dark corner of this prison.

00:38.423 --> 00:40.090
How would you feel about
renovating my summer house

00:40.125 --> 00:41.892
- in the Hamptons?
- Are you sure?

00:41.927 --> 00:43.560
I've never been as sure of
anything in my entire life.

00:43.596 --> 00:45.495
The whole time, you were
always gonna bring him here.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.163
Because this is the
way to get it done.

00:47.199 --> 00:49.199
Then why didn't you tell
me that in the first place?

00:49.234 --> 00:51.434
Because it would've ended up
with you wanting to use Rachel.

00:51.470 --> 00:55.038
It ended there anyway. Now
get the hell out of my way.

00:55.074 --> 00:57.273
Harvey!

00:57.309 --> 01:00.443
I told Rachel everything.

01:00.479 --> 01:02.079
I'm taking the deal.

01:06.179 --> 01:07.879
All right, let's talk specifically

01:07.914 --> 01:09.146
about what you need.

01:09.182 --> 01:10.915
What I need is a conviction.

01:10.950 --> 01:13.251
Obviously, but what
exactly does that look like

01:13.286 --> 01:14.986
- from my side?
- It looks like a smoking gun,

01:15.021 --> 01:16.721
'cause I've been after
Sutter for three years now.

01:16.757 --> 01:18.222
This guy's one slippery son of a bitch.

01:18.258 --> 01:20.224
Wait a second. William Sutter?

01:20.260 --> 01:21.225
Are you kidding me?

01:21.261 --> 01:22.560
Harvey, what's going on?

01:22.596 --> 01:25.229
He came to me a week ago to
take him on, and I said no.

01:25.265 --> 01:26.898
Well, it's a good thing you did.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.900
- No, it isn't.
- What are you talking about?

01:28.935 --> 01:30.935
When Kevin finds out I
told his father-in-law

01:30.970 --> 01:32.837
to drop dead, he's never
gonna trust Mike.

01:32.873 --> 01:34.272
If you're saying what
I think you're saying,

01:34.307 --> 01:35.940
you're not taking this
man as your client.

01:35.975 --> 01:37.809
Yes, I am, because if I don't,

01:37.844 --> 01:39.611
we might as well not even be doing this.

01:39.646 --> 01:41.946
- Then let's not do it.
- Look where we are, Sean.

01:41.981 --> 01:43.981
We're in a car, sneaking
Mike into prison.

01:44.017 --> 01:46.083
You pulled every string you
have to make this happen.

01:46.119 --> 01:47.685
You're gonna pull out now?

01:47.721 --> 01:48.820
I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put myself

01:48.855 --> 01:50.087
in position to collude with you.

01:50.123 --> 01:51.523
I won't put you in that position.

01:51.558 --> 01:52.924
I'm in that position right now.

01:52.959 --> 01:54.292
No, you're not.

01:54.327 --> 01:55.827
He isn't even representing anybody yet.

01:55.862 --> 01:57.829
This conversation is
completely hypothetical.

01:57.864 --> 01:59.898
I don't need legal
advice from the convict,

01:59.933 --> 02:01.533
and I don't need to lose my career

02:01.568 --> 02:03.234
because you tanked this guy's defense.

02:03.269 --> 02:04.869
I'm not tanking anything.

02:04.905 --> 02:06.905
I'm gonna kick ass for him
up and down the block,

02:06.940 --> 02:08.806
and there's no law against
me rooting for Mike

02:08.842 --> 02:11.476
while I'm doing that.

02:11.511 --> 02:14.879
Okay, but you cross one line
that puts me in jeopardy,

02:14.915 --> 02:16.748
I'm gonna pull the plug
on this whole thing.

02:16.783 --> 02:18.716
Well, Mike better get us what we need

02:18.752 --> 02:20.585
before I have to do that.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074

02:30.964 --> 02:31.996
Hello?

02:32.031 --> 02:33.731
Rachel. Professor Dunbar.

02:33.767 --> 02:34.933
- What is it?
- I know how passionate

02:34.968 --> 02:36.935
you were about Leonard Bailey,

02:36.970 --> 02:38.770
but I just heard back from
the Innocence Project,

02:38.805 --> 02:41.773
and... I'm afraid his
case doesn't qualify.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.140
What do you mean it doesn't qualify?

02:43.176 --> 02:45.142
We have three different
grounds for an appeal.

02:45.178 --> 02:47.178
And, unfortunately,
none of them revolve

02:47.213 --> 02:49.948
around the existence of
previously undiscovered DNA.

02:49.983 --> 02:51.115
What does that have to do with it?

02:51.150 --> 02:52.584
The man was railroaded.

02:52.619 --> 02:53.985
He deserves to have his case retried.

02:54.020 --> 02:55.687
It has everything to do with it,

02:55.722 --> 02:56.921
because in a case like this,

02:56.957 --> 02:57.956
that's the primary determinant

02:57.991 --> 02:59.757
for whether it qualifies or not.

02:59.793 --> 03:00.959
I don't care whether
it qualifies or not.

03:00.994 --> 03:03.728
I promised Leonard Bailey
that I'd fight for him.

03:03.763 --> 03:06.564
Well, you shouldn't have done that.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.199
Professor, I know
that we're not supposed

03:08.234 --> 03:10.935
to become emotionally
invested in our clients,

03:10.971 --> 03:12.737
but if we don't have any passion,

03:12.772 --> 03:15.306
then what's the point of trying
to help them in the first place?

03:15.341 --> 03:18.142
Rachel, I understand this
is a difficult thing to hear,

03:18.177 --> 03:20.945
but there's nothing I can do.

03:20.981 --> 03:23.815
Look, I give you my word.

03:23.850 --> 03:25.483
We'll find you a new case.

03:34.661 --> 03:36.828
- Mike, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:36.863 --> 03:38.095
Go back to sleep. I'll talk
to you in the morning.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
How are you? You all right?

03:42.536 --> 03:43.968
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:44.004 --> 03:45.670
- What was it?
- Whatever it was,

03:45.705 --> 03:47.972
they can't find a trace of it.

03:48.008 --> 03:50.909
Officially, it's food poisoning.

03:50.944 --> 03:53.845
Well, I finally got the chance
to meet your buddy Harvey.

03:56.215 --> 03:58.783
- Harvey was here?
- In this very cell.

03:58.818 --> 04:00.885
- You're kidding me.
- I shit you not.

04:00.921 --> 04:02.119
You should've seen him.

04:02.155 --> 04:03.688
Thought he was gonna attack
Gallo right then and there.

04:03.723 --> 04:06.123
- What stopped him?
- Guards.

04:08.562 --> 04:10.795
You sure you're okay?

04:10.830 --> 04:12.864
Yeah.

04:12.899 --> 04:14.699
I just need to get some sleep.

04:16.502 --> 04:19.136
Well, it's good to
have you back, buddy.

04:19.172 --> 04:22.707
Once you get used to having
someone around you can trust,

04:22.742 --> 04:24.542
it's hard to go back.

05:09.553 --> 05:11.120
Whatever it is you're
doing, I want you to drop it

05:11.155 --> 05:12.521
and help me buy a house in the Hamptons.

05:12.556 --> 05:14.123
- Excuse me?
- I said I need a large,

05:14.158 --> 05:16.492
expensive home in the Hamptons,
preferably on the water.

05:16.527 --> 05:18.394
Louis, I don't mean to
be your business manager,

05:18.429 --> 05:19.861
but why are you buying a vacation home

05:19.897 --> 05:21.563
when the firm's just
getting back on its feet?

05:21.598 --> 05:23.532
Because I told Tara Messer
that I have a property

05:23.567 --> 05:25.300
out there, and I hired her
to remodel it for me.

05:25.336 --> 05:26.635
Okay, let me get this straight.

05:26.670 --> 05:28.137
You want to spend a
fortune buying a home

05:28.172 --> 05:30.005
so that you can spend another
fortune remodeling it?

05:30.041 --> 05:31.507
It's the only logical way
that I can spend time with her.

05:31.542 --> 05:32.874
- Is it?
- Yes.

05:32.910 --> 05:34.009
What other way could there possibly be?

05:34.045 --> 05:35.644
You could just ask her out.

05:35.679 --> 05:36.545
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

05:36.580 --> 05:37.913
- Because I'm not.
- Louis.

05:37.948 --> 05:39.581
Jesus Christ, why are you trying

05:39.616 --> 05:41.917
- to sabotage my relationship?
- You have no relationship.

05:41.952 --> 05:43.419
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

05:43.454 --> 05:45.187
I have no relationship.

05:45.222 --> 05:48.023
I'm all alone.

05:48.059 --> 05:51.360
Ever since Sheila rejected me,

05:51.395 --> 05:52.827
I never thought I would find love again,

05:52.863 --> 05:56.098
but there is something... I don't know.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.800
There's just something about this woman.

05:58.835 --> 06:01.937
I feel like this may be my last shot.

06:01.972 --> 06:06.708
I get that, Louis, and
if you ask her out,

06:06.743 --> 06:08.177
she is going to see a kind,

06:08.212 --> 06:10.145
intelligent man that any woman

06:10.181 --> 06:13.648
would be lucky to be in
a relationship with.

06:13.684 --> 06:15.617
But if you do it this
way, and she finds out,

06:15.652 --> 06:17.553
then you lose that shot,
because she's never

06:17.588 --> 06:18.987
gonna trust you again.

06:19.022 --> 06:20.189
Look at me, Donna.

06:20.224 --> 06:21.490
A woman like that...

06:23.494 --> 06:25.527
Please.

06:25.563 --> 06:27.829
I need her to get to know me first.

06:27.864 --> 06:30.165
All right, Louis.

06:30.201 --> 06:32.167
I'll help you find a house.

06:38.909 --> 06:41.743
Looking at my pictures again?

06:41.778 --> 06:44.513
- Sorry.
- What's going on?

06:44.548 --> 06:46.681
Nothing. I was just...

06:46.717 --> 06:48.484
I was just thinking
about when I asked you

06:48.519 --> 06:50.685
what you were in for.
We got interrupted.

06:50.721 --> 06:51.686
You never told me.

06:51.722 --> 06:53.388
Well, just as well,

06:53.424 --> 06:56.592
'cause I don't want to talk about it.

06:56.627 --> 06:58.527
- Okay, why not?
- Why not?

06:58.562 --> 06:59.794
'Cause if I wanted to talk about it,

06:59.830 --> 07:01.296
I'd be talking about it.

07:01.332 --> 07:02.498
Look, I understand that we're not

07:02.533 --> 07:04.633
supposed to talk about that stuff,

07:04.668 --> 07:06.535
but when you think you might've
been poisoned by somebody,

07:06.570 --> 07:07.702
it makes you want to know
something about the guy

07:07.738 --> 07:09.271
you're sharing a cell with.

07:09.306 --> 07:10.439
You saying you don't trust me, Mike?

07:10.474 --> 07:11.940
Kevin, I'm serious.

07:11.975 --> 07:13.842
I've told you pretty much
everything about me,

07:13.877 --> 07:15.477
and besides the fact that you
don't want your kids to visit,

07:15.513 --> 07:18.480
I don't know anything about you.

07:18.516 --> 07:20.282
Look, Mike, there's a lot
of things that I'm ready

07:20.317 --> 07:22.484
to tell you.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.819
I'm just not ready to tell you that.

07:24.855 --> 07:26.955
Okay?

07:36.700 --> 07:40.569
Mr. Specter, you don't
have an appointment.

07:40.604 --> 07:41.903
It's okay, Julie.

07:41.938 --> 07:43.639
Someone calls me a piece
of shit to my face,

07:43.674 --> 07:45.073
I want to know what the encore is.

07:45.108 --> 07:46.875
You here to piss on my floor?

07:46.910 --> 07:49.144
I'm here to tell you that I'm
taking your case after all.

07:49.180 --> 07:50.679
Who says I didn't hire someone else

07:50.714 --> 07:52.481
the second you turned me down?

07:52.516 --> 07:54.916
I do, because you didn't pick
my name out of a phone book.

07:54.951 --> 07:56.552
You came to me because you found out

07:56.587 --> 07:58.587
that your guy's in prison with my guy.

07:58.622 --> 08:01.423
- So what if I did?
- Cut the shit, William.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.793
Your son-in-law saved Mike
from a guy I put behind bars.

08:04.828 --> 08:07.496
That means I owe you, and
you didn't tell me about it

08:07.531 --> 08:08.863
because you knew I'd find out

08:08.899 --> 08:10.532
and come crawling back on my own.

08:10.568 --> 08:12.167
You're hardly crawling.

08:12.203 --> 08:13.168
I didn't as a baby,

08:13.204 --> 08:14.469
and I'm not gonna start now.

08:14.505 --> 08:15.937
This is the best you're gonna get.

08:15.972 --> 08:18.574
So are we doing this
thing together or not?

08:21.011 --> 08:23.978
Okay. You got me, Harvey.

08:24.014 --> 08:24.979
Now what?

08:25.015 --> 08:26.881
Now I go see your son-in-law.

08:26.917 --> 08:29.150
Why the hell would
you want to do that?

08:29.186 --> 08:31.886
Because he's in prison, and
you're facing an indictment,

08:31.922 --> 08:34.690
which makes him the biggest
vulnerability you have.

08:38.729 --> 08:41.363
You have a call from
Danbury Federal Prison.

08:41.398 --> 08:42.731
Do you accept the charges?

08:42.765 --> 08:43.998
Yes.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.667
Harvey, we have a problem.

08:45.703 --> 08:47.001
- What is it?
- I tried to talk to Kevin.

08:47.037 --> 08:48.503
I got nothing.

08:48.539 --> 08:49.705
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

08:49.740 --> 08:51.573
I don't know.

08:51.609 --> 08:53.141
It would help if I had something
to talk about other than,

08:53.176 --> 08:55.043
"Hey, what exactly are you in here for?"

08:55.078 --> 08:57.546
Okay, Mike, you want
something to talk about?

08:57.581 --> 08:59.581
I'll get you something to talk about.

09:06.657 --> 09:09.625
Well, if it isn't my
knight in beautiful armor.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.959
How are you, Mr. Bailey?

09:10.994 --> 09:13.962
Please, call me Leonard.

09:13.997 --> 09:16.798
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Leonard.

09:16.833 --> 09:21.270
The Innocence Project looked
over the new evidence, and...

09:21.305 --> 09:23.805
they decided not to take your case.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.641
What does that mean?

09:25.676 --> 09:27.676
It means there's
nothing else I can do.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.444
I knew you couldn't do shit for me.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.313
No, no, no. You don't understand.

09:31.348 --> 09:34.449
They almost never take cases
without new DNA evidence,

09:34.485 --> 09:35.684
and yours had none.

09:35.719 --> 09:37.486
I don't care about that.

09:37.521 --> 09:39.888
You asked me to take a chance on you,

09:39.923 --> 09:42.524
and now you march in here and
tell me you're giving up?

09:42.559 --> 09:43.558
No, no, Mr. Bailey...

09:43.594 --> 09:44.893
You said you would fight for me.

09:44.928 --> 09:46.295
I did fight for you.

09:46.330 --> 09:48.630
Well, then fight goddamn harder!

09:59.610 --> 10:01.810
I'm sorry,

10:01.845 --> 10:04.078
and I understand how you feel,

10:04.114 --> 10:06.214
but there's just nothing
more that I can do.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.882
How do you know what I feel?

10:07.918 --> 10:09.685
You don't know what it's
like to be kept away

10:09.720 --> 10:11.820
from your loved ones.

10:11.855 --> 10:14.356
- Actually, I do.
- How's that?

10:14.391 --> 10:16.491
My fiancÃ©'s in prison.

10:18.529 --> 10:20.362
How long?

10:20.397 --> 10:22.497
- Two years.
- Two years is nothing.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.898
It doesn't feel like nothing to me.

10:23.934 --> 10:26.501
What if it was forever, Rachel?

10:26.537 --> 10:28.570
Would you give up on
him like you did me?

10:28.605 --> 10:30.104
I didn't give up on you.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.106
You said you found
compelling evidence.

10:32.142 --> 10:34.242
I also said that it wasn't enough.

10:34.277 --> 10:38.380
That sounds like giving up to me.

10:46.156 --> 10:47.556
Harvey, what are you doing here?

10:47.591 --> 10:48.957
I'm here to give you official notice.

10:48.992 --> 10:50.726
I'm now William Sutter's attorney.

10:50.761 --> 10:52.961
Congratulations. I hope
you know what you're doing.

10:52.996 --> 10:55.597
I do, because I'm also
here to notify you that

10:55.632 --> 10:58.099
unless you bring an indictment
in the next 48 hours,

10:58.134 --> 11:00.869
I'm gonna sue you and the SEC
for harassing my client.

11:00.904 --> 11:01.870
What the hell are you talking about?

11:01.905 --> 11:03.137
You heard me. You've been digging

11:03.173 --> 11:05.139
into his accounts,
hounding his employees,

11:05.175 --> 11:06.708
and questioning his investors.

11:06.744 --> 11:09.511
He's under investigation
for insider trading.

11:09.546 --> 11:11.012
That's how it works.

11:11.047 --> 11:13.382
Well, if that's how it works,
then bring on an indictment.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.550
Ah, I see what you're doing.

11:15.586 --> 11:18.420
Mike can't get Kevin to talk
without me bringing an action.

11:18.455 --> 11:20.422
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:20.457 --> 11:21.556
Oh, well, it doesn't
matter, 'cause I'm not

11:21.592 --> 11:22.557
bringing an indictment without knowing

11:22.593 --> 11:23.725
that I can win at trial.

11:23.761 --> 11:25.059
And you're never gonna win at trial

11:25.095 --> 11:26.895
if you don't shake the
trees and see what falls.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.497
Damn it, Harvey, I am
not colluding on this,

11:28.532 --> 11:30.031
and you're in here trying to get me

11:30.066 --> 11:31.533
to bring an indictment
against your own client.

11:31.568 --> 11:33.167
Because when you
bring that indictment,

11:33.203 --> 11:34.736
I'm gonna beat it, and
if you don't bring it

11:34.772 --> 11:36.605
and continue investigating my client,

11:36.640 --> 11:38.507
I'm gonna sue you, which is exactly

11:38.542 --> 11:40.542
what I'd be doing no matter who he was.

11:40.577 --> 11:42.677
You know what, Harvey? You
want me to bring an action?

11:42.713 --> 11:44.045
You got one.

11:58.032 --> 11:59.430
Jesus Christ, there you are.

11:59.466 --> 12:00.598
What's going on with the house hunt?

12:00.634 --> 12:01.684
I am on top of it, Louis.

12:01.836 --> 12:03.068
Well, it doesn't look
like you're on top of it.

12:03.104 --> 12:04.704
It looks like you're drinking
a goddamn cup of coffee.

12:04.739 --> 12:06.773
Maybe that's because I was
on the Internet all night

12:06.808 --> 12:08.140
trying to find houses
for you because I knew

12:08.176 --> 12:10.976
that nothing would ever meet
your insane specifications.

12:11.012 --> 12:12.412
- Is that true?
- Not one word.

12:12.447 --> 12:14.213
Goddamn it, Donna, this is important.

12:14.248 --> 12:16.215
Right now there are hundreds of
men out there with beach houses,

12:16.250 --> 12:17.450
and Tara could be meeting
any one of them.

12:17.485 --> 12:19.419
Right now I wish I was
meeting any one of them.

12:19.454 --> 12:22.755
Donna, I thought you
understood this isn't a joke.

12:22.791 --> 12:24.890
I know it isn't, Louis,

12:24.926 --> 12:26.626
and that's why I haven't sent
you anything I've seen so far,

12:26.661 --> 12:28.260
because I haven't found
the right thing yet.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.162
And what if I said I lost
confidence in your ability

12:30.198 --> 12:32.432
to know what I'm looking for
in any given situation?

12:32.467 --> 12:34.066
Then I would say that that is exactly

12:34.101 --> 12:35.601
why I've been avoiding you,

12:35.637 --> 12:37.102
and if you had any
self-awareness at all,

12:37.138 --> 12:39.505
you would stop bothering me and
instead trust me for once.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.474
Well, we both know
that's never gonna happen.

12:41.509 --> 12:44.276
Well, then, why don't you go
find your own house, Louis?

12:50.117 --> 12:51.784
- Gin.
- Again?

12:51.820 --> 12:53.586
How many times do I have to tell you?

12:53.621 --> 12:55.788
Don't play cards with a guy
with a photographic memory.

12:55.824 --> 12:58.090
How many times I have to tell
you I'm still gonna beat you?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.892
Deal.

12:59.927 --> 13:02.395
Sorry to interrupt your Go Fish.

13:02.430 --> 13:04.430
There's a Harvey Specter
here to see you.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.232
Saved by the bell.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.868
Not you, Ross. Miller.

13:32.861 --> 13:35.428
Mind if I ask why you're here
to see me instead of Mike?

13:35.463 --> 13:36.962
Because I heard he's okay,

13:36.998 --> 13:39.432
and I'm not just Mike's
attorney anymore.

13:39.467 --> 13:40.933
I'm yours.

13:40.968 --> 13:42.502
I don't need your help with Gallo.

13:42.537 --> 13:44.136
I'm not talking about Gallo.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.906
William Sutter came to
me to represent him.

13:46.941 --> 13:49.275
I turned him down until I
found out that his son-in-law

13:49.310 --> 13:51.143
is the one who's been
watching Mike's back.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.646
Well, I appreciate that,

13:53.681 --> 13:55.648
but what does that have to do with me?

13:55.683 --> 13:57.283
I don't make it a habit
of representing people

13:57.318 --> 13:58.083
I can't trust.

13:58.119 --> 13:59.351
You saying you can't trust me?

13:59.387 --> 14:01.788
I'm saying the SEC
thinks William's firm,

14:01.823 --> 14:04.457
the one that you worked
for, is breaking the law.

14:04.492 --> 14:06.559
So I need to know right now,

14:06.594 --> 14:09.128
when they come at you,
what are you gonna say?

14:09.163 --> 14:10.296
I'm gonna say the same thing I did

14:10.331 --> 14:12.364
when they came at me the last time.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.467
My father-in-law's innocent.

14:14.502 --> 14:16.268
Is that it or can I go?

14:16.304 --> 14:19.204
One more thing, Kevin.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
An indictment's coming down any second,

14:21.275 --> 14:23.042
and once it does, that makes you

14:23.077 --> 14:25.311
every single inmate's
ticket out of here.

14:25.346 --> 14:29.081
So if you ever have a doubt
about William's innocence,

14:29.116 --> 14:31.216
keep it to your goddamn self.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.132
Kevin, talk to you for a second?

14:47.168 --> 14:48.935
Yeah, sure. What's going on, George?

14:48.970 --> 14:51.971
- It's about your roommate.
- What about him?

14:52.006 --> 14:53.573
You got some nerve playing cards here

14:53.608 --> 14:55.407
while my life is wasting away.

14:55.443 --> 14:57.844
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about that motion

14:57.879 --> 14:59.545
you were supposed to file for me.

14:59.581 --> 15:01.246
Then you better get your facts
straight, because I did file it.

15:01.282 --> 15:03.415
Yeah, and it got bounced right back.

15:03.451 --> 15:06.418
- What? No, that's not possible.
- It is possible.

15:06.454 --> 15:08.788
While you were taking your
little siesta in the infirmary,

15:08.823 --> 15:10.422
I got an email that said the damn thing

15:10.458 --> 15:12.625
wasn't even filed right.

15:15.730 --> 15:17.229
Oh, goddamn it.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.230
Looks like you can't
keep your promises.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.966
No, I can keep it.

15:20.001 --> 15:22.067
This is just some procedural
mix-up, all right?

15:22.103 --> 15:23.803
But I'm gonna need to use your phone.

15:23.838 --> 15:25.237
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm telling you that

15:25.272 --> 15:26.372
I can have this thing taken care of.

15:26.407 --> 15:28.073
I just need to make a phone call.

15:28.109 --> 15:29.208
What's wrong with the
goddamn phones in here?

15:29.243 --> 15:31.043
Nothing, but I already used it today,

15:31.078 --> 15:32.712
which means I can't use
it for another two days.

15:32.747 --> 15:34.413
So unless you want to waste that
time playing cards with me,

15:34.448 --> 15:35.815
which I guarantee you'll lose,

15:35.850 --> 15:38.450
you'll give me your phone right now.

15:38.486 --> 15:41.153
I like you. You got balls.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.655
You know what? So do I, which is why

15:42.690 --> 15:44.423
I can take this out in
front of any guard in here

15:44.458 --> 15:46.392
and know I'm not getting in any trouble.

15:46.427 --> 15:50.730
Don't forget that, and
get that shit handled.

16:08.115 --> 16:09.749
Harvey, I have something for you.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.684
- What is it?
- It's from Sean Cahill,

16:11.719 --> 16:13.285
and I need you to take a
look at it right away.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.187
Why? I know what an
indictment looks like.

16:15.222 --> 16:16.923
It's not an indictment, Harvey.

16:16.958 --> 16:19.625
He's suspending William
Sutter's trading license.

16:19.661 --> 16:21.060
Get Cahill on the phone.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.431
Sir, I have Harvey
Specter on the line.

16:25.466 --> 16:28.000
Oh, you've got to be shitting me.

16:29.971 --> 16:31.637
Harvey, what can I do for you?

16:31.673 --> 16:33.472
You can explain to me
what the hell you're up to,

16:33.507 --> 16:35.741
suspending my client's trading license.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.543
You wanted to get the ball rolling.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.711
This gets the ball rolling.

16:38.746 --> 16:39.879
This isn't what I wanted.

16:39.914 --> 16:41.313
And I don't take orders from you.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.449
And I'm not gonna be able
to stop this in court,

16:43.484 --> 16:45.117
which means Sutter's gonna fire me.

16:45.152 --> 16:47.453
Then maybe you didn't
understand my initial position.

16:47.488 --> 16:49.321
I don't give a shit if
you get fired or not.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.290
You thought that you needed
to represent Sutter,

16:51.325 --> 16:53.158
so you went ahead and did
what you needed to do.

16:53.194 --> 16:55.160
I thought I didn't want
to bring an indictment

16:55.196 --> 16:56.228
before I had enough to win,

16:56.263 --> 16:58.064
so I did what I needed to do,

16:58.099 --> 16:59.832
but what I need to do right now

16:59.867 --> 17:02.001
is finish this delicious ham sandwich,

17:02.036 --> 17:04.103
which means the next
time that I talk to you,

17:04.137 --> 17:07.006
I expect it to be in court.

17:25.159 --> 17:28.761
Hey, what's going on?

17:28.796 --> 17:30.796
What do you mean, what's going on?

17:30.832 --> 17:33.198
I mean, we're playing cards,
and Harvey's here to see you,

17:33.234 --> 17:34.299
and then next thing I know,

17:34.335 --> 17:35.768
you're giving me some death stare,

17:35.803 --> 17:37.970
and you come out here.

17:38.006 --> 17:40.039
Nothing's going on.

17:40.074 --> 17:42.975
Well, what did Harvey want?

17:43.011 --> 17:45.377
He's representing my father-in-law,

17:45.412 --> 17:47.113
which means now he's
also representing me.

17:47.148 --> 17:48.881
That good enough for you?

17:48.916 --> 17:50.616
All right, Kevin,
what's with the attitude?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.885
- I'm on your side.
- Are you?

17:52.920 --> 17:54.987
'Cause Harvey said I shouldn't
trust anyone in here,

17:55.023 --> 17:58.590
and as far as I'm concerned,
that includes you.

17:58.626 --> 18:00.826
What? Hey, that
doesn't make any sense.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.261
You know what doesn't make any sense?

18:02.296 --> 18:04.664
One minute Gallo is your
enemy, and the next minute,

18:04.699 --> 18:07.033
he's handing you his cell phone
like he's your best friend.

18:07.068 --> 18:08.567
I'm trying to help
him get out of here,

18:08.602 --> 18:10.703
which is good for both of us.

18:10.738 --> 18:13.172
Is that what you were doing
last night outside of prison?

18:13.207 --> 18:14.707
You were helping him get out?

18:14.742 --> 18:16.441
Is that what was going on?

18:16.477 --> 18:17.777
Kevin, come on.

18:17.812 --> 18:19.045
I was worried about you, cellmate.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.512
I thought you were in real trouble,

18:20.548 --> 18:21.881
but they wouldn't let me see you,

18:21.916 --> 18:23.082
so I asked a friend of mine

18:23.117 --> 18:25.117
who works in the infirmary
to check on you,

18:25.153 --> 18:27.086
and ten minutes ago he told
me that he's pretty damn sure

18:27.121 --> 18:29.889
you were gone for at least three hours.

18:31.292 --> 18:35.061
Well, what do you have
to say about that?

18:35.096 --> 18:36.962
I was gone because I
was in the hospital.

18:36.998 --> 18:37.963
That's the first I'm hearing about it.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.198
Yeah, and why would I tell you that?

18:39.233 --> 18:40.199
Why wouldn't you?
Something's going on here,

18:40.234 --> 18:41.633
- and I can tell.
- All right, Kevin.

18:41.669 --> 18:43.268
You want to know what happened?
I went to the hospital because

18:43.304 --> 18:45.071
Harvey paid the doctor because
he didn't trust that I would

18:45.106 --> 18:47.039
make it through the night in
here, and I didn't tell you

18:47.075 --> 18:48.207
because I didn't want to
put you in a position

18:48.242 --> 18:49.408
where you'd have to lie for me.
You know what?

18:49.443 --> 18:51.077
That sounds like a whole
lot of bullshit to me.

18:51.112 --> 18:52.211
Yeah, you know what, Kevin?
I think it's pretty

18:52.246 --> 18:53.813
goddamn funny that you don't trust me

18:53.848 --> 18:55.247
when you're the one
that won't even tell me

18:55.282 --> 18:56.415
what you're in here for.

19:02.467 --> 19:05.203
No. No. No.

19:05.238 --> 19:06.604
Shit, no.

19:06.639 --> 19:10.041
No. No. No. Not now, Harvey.

19:10.076 --> 19:11.709
I'm in the middle of
something important.

19:11.744 --> 19:14.279
Whatever it is, it's not
as important as this.

19:14.314 --> 19:15.880
What is this?

19:15.916 --> 19:18.082
It's notice to suspend William
Sutter's trading license.

19:18.118 --> 19:21.719
The question is, what
can be done about it?

19:21.754 --> 19:23.154
- Nothing can be done about it.
- What do you mean,

19:23.190 --> 19:24.588
nothing can be done about it?

19:24.624 --> 19:25.957
You're supposed to be
the financial wizard.

19:25.992 --> 19:27.625
I am, and I'm telling you

19:27.660 --> 19:30.161
that this kind of thing is
at the SEC's discretion.

19:30.197 --> 19:31.129
They have unlimited power to suspend

19:31.164 --> 19:32.630
trading licenses up to 90 days.

19:32.665 --> 19:34.232
- Goddamn it.
- It's only 90 days.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.900
90 days gets me fired.

19:35.936 --> 19:37.168
Well, it's gonna be okay, Harvey.

19:37.204 --> 19:38.236
I mean, I know things have
been rough around here,

19:38.271 --> 19:39.237
but business is picking up.

19:39.272 --> 19:40.571
This isn't about business, Louis.

19:40.606 --> 19:42.106
It's about Mike.

19:44.677 --> 19:46.244
What are you not telling me, Harvey?

19:46.279 --> 19:47.511
I'm not gonna tell you the details,

19:47.547 --> 19:49.080
because I'm not gonna put you at risk,

19:49.115 --> 19:51.249
but I have a chance to
get Mike out early,

19:51.284 --> 19:53.985
and if I lose this motion, it's over.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.786
Well, then I'll figure
out a way to get it done.

19:55.822 --> 19:57.155
Thank you, Louis.

20:06.299 --> 20:07.999
This is Harvey Specter.
Harvey, it's me.

20:08.034 --> 20:10.601
Mike, what the hell are you
doing with a private phone?

20:10.636 --> 20:12.203
What the hell are you
doing representing Kevin?

20:12.239 --> 20:14.172
You were the one having
trouble getting him to open up.

20:14.207 --> 20:16.040
And you thought telling him
not to trust anyone in here

20:16.076 --> 20:18.209
was the answer to that?

20:18.245 --> 20:20.211
Look, I did that to
get him to trust me,

20:20.247 --> 20:22.613
because if he trusts me, he trusts you.

20:22.648 --> 20:25.383
Yeah, well, you didn't
count on one thing.

20:25.418 --> 20:27.785
He knows I wasn't in the
infirmary the whole night.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.854
What? How the hell does he know that?

20:29.890 --> 20:31.622
Some guy he knows works there.

20:31.657 --> 20:33.291
I told him some story about you
taking me to the hospital,

20:33.326 --> 20:35.026
but he's not buying it.

20:35.061 --> 20:36.794
Then you figure out a
way to make him buy it.

20:36.829 --> 20:38.062
Fine, I'll think of something,

20:38.098 --> 20:41.399
but that's not my only problem.

20:41.434 --> 20:42.833
What now?

20:42.869 --> 20:44.302
Gallo's filing came back.

20:44.337 --> 20:45.703
It needs to be filed in person

20:45.738 --> 20:48.239
and it needs to be filed
by his attorney of record.

20:48.275 --> 20:49.707
You got to be shitting me.

20:49.742 --> 20:51.675
You want me to represent that animal?

20:51.711 --> 20:53.211
If you don't, then
getting Kevin to talk

20:53.246 --> 20:54.879
is gonna be the least of my problems.

21:03.075 --> 21:05.342
Rachel, I need your help with something.

21:05.377 --> 21:06.185
What can I do?

21:06.455 --> 21:08.122
I need you to draft
a parole application

21:08.157 --> 21:09.123
for Frank Gallo.

21:09.158 --> 21:10.691
I thought Mike was doing that.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.459
There was a problem, which is also why

21:12.495 --> 21:14.028
I need you to draw up
an engagement letter

21:14.063 --> 21:16.764
for me to be Gallo's attorney.

21:17.767 --> 21:18.933
Done.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.873
Hey, what is it?

21:25.909 --> 21:27.642
I heard you get upset
with Louis earlier,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.109
and now you're coming to me about Gallo.

21:29.145 --> 21:32.112
So... I just need to know if you think

21:32.148 --> 21:34.381
this whole Cahill thing's
really gonna work.

21:34.417 --> 21:35.382
- Rachel...
- Harvey,

21:35.418 --> 21:36.717
just tell me the truth.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.286
Look, I don't know if
it's gonna work or not,

21:39.321 --> 21:42.122
but I do know I'm not gonna stop trying.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.931
Got to say, you don't
look so bad for a guy

21:49.966 --> 21:51.966
who blacked out in the
yard the other day.

21:52.001 --> 21:53.901
Yeah, they took good care of me.

21:53.937 --> 21:57.705
Well, I'm glad you're okay.
What's on your mind?

21:57.740 --> 21:59.707
I need you to get a message
to the warden for me.

21:59.742 --> 22:01.108
Sure.

22:01.143 --> 22:03.110
I'll bring it to him
at our weekly brunch.

22:03.145 --> 22:04.679
What would you like for it to say?

22:04.714 --> 22:06.180
- I'm serious.
- I don't care what you are.

22:06.215 --> 22:07.848
You want to get a message to the warden,

22:07.884 --> 22:08.783
you go through the proper channels

22:08.818 --> 22:09.884
and get it to him yourself.

22:09.919 --> 22:11.218
I can't go through
the proper channels,

22:11.253 --> 22:14.555
because nobody can know about it.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.791
All right, Mike, tell
me what's going on.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.729
I made a deal to get
out of here early.

22:21.764 --> 22:23.030
What kind of deal?

22:23.066 --> 22:24.699
The kind where I inform on someone.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.968
Someone?

22:27.003 --> 22:28.636
Kevin Miller.

22:28.671 --> 22:30.370
- Oh, Mike, come on.
- Julius, let me explain.

22:30.406 --> 22:32.106
I don't need you to explain.

22:32.141 --> 22:34.642
You are betraying your cellmate,
who you came to me to protect.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.811
No, what I am doing
is putting away someone

22:36.846 --> 22:38.713
who is out there doing worse
things than I ever did.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.715
So I don't need your judgment.
I need your help.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.217
I'm sorry, it's not my job to
help you do something like this.

22:43.252 --> 22:45.586
No, it's your job to help me
prepare for life after prison.

22:45.622 --> 22:47.154
Well, this is gonna
make life after prison

22:47.189 --> 22:48.889
come a hell of a lot faster.

22:48.925 --> 22:50.057
Well, fine, you want to do this?

22:50.093 --> 22:51.993
You go ahead and do it, but I
am not gonna be complicit.

22:52.028 --> 22:53.828
You know what? You
talk a big goddamn game

22:53.863 --> 22:55.830
about trusting you, but
what does that trust mean?

22:55.865 --> 22:57.431
Now, I need to get to the warden,

22:57.466 --> 22:59.433
and I need to do it without
the guards finding out.

22:59.468 --> 23:01.602
Can you help me or not?

23:13.816 --> 23:15.850
Rachel, what are you
doing here so late?

23:15.885 --> 23:17.417
Professor, do you have a minute?

23:17.453 --> 23:19.820
Of course. Yeah, sit down.

23:26.062 --> 23:27.862
I went to see Leonard
Bailey this morning

23:27.897 --> 23:29.463
to tell him we were
turning our backs on him.

23:29.498 --> 23:31.198
No one's turning their
back on him, Rachel.

23:31.233 --> 23:32.900
There are just better cases.

23:32.935 --> 23:35.235
No offense, but that's bullshit.

23:35.271 --> 23:37.437
- Excuse me?
- You read his file.

23:37.473 --> 23:39.807
There's enough evidence in there
for him to get a new trial,

23:39.842 --> 23:41.642
and instead we're gonna
let him rot on death row.

23:41.678 --> 23:42.910
Rachel, I understand how you feel,

23:42.945 --> 23:44.478
but there are some things that...

23:44.513 --> 23:46.914
I feel like I dropped your
class to take this case.

23:46.949 --> 23:48.415
And I told you I'd
get you another one.

23:48.450 --> 23:50.918
I don't want another one.
I want this one.

23:50.953 --> 23:52.887
Rachel, I cannot provide you

23:52.922 --> 23:54.621
with the resources and
the backing anymore.

23:54.657 --> 23:56.891
Okay, so what if I were able
to provide my own resources

23:56.926 --> 24:00.861
and... and to get the supervision
of a qualified lawyer?

24:00.897 --> 24:02.663
What are you talking about?

24:02.699 --> 24:05.332
I work at Pearson
Specter Litt, Professor.

24:05.367 --> 24:07.434
They've been known to
take a pro bono case

24:07.469 --> 24:09.036
from time to time.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.273
Okay.

24:13.309 --> 24:16.577
Okay, you win, Rachel, but
this is highly irregular.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.245
I don't care.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.880
That's not a good enough
reason to turn our backs

24:19.916 --> 24:21.048
on Leonard Bailey.

24:24.486 --> 24:26.754
Well, don't ever question
my financial wizardry again.

24:26.789 --> 24:28.589
Let's have it.

24:28.624 --> 24:30.091
I was banging my head against
the wall, trying to figure out

24:30.126 --> 24:31.792
a way to stop the suspension,
but then it dawned on me.

24:31.828 --> 24:33.227
We don't need to stop it.

24:33.262 --> 24:34.862
If we can turn Sutter's
firm into the subsidiary

24:34.897 --> 24:36.597
of a separate holding company,

24:36.632 --> 24:38.265
we can find someone else to
execute the trades for him.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.900
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, but the only issue is,

24:39.936 --> 24:41.268
we need to find traders that are willing

24:41.303 --> 24:42.302
to bankroll the son of a bitch,

24:42.338 --> 24:43.904
given his reputation.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.972
Well, that's not gonna be a problem.

24:45.007 --> 24:46.273
No, Harvey, this is not nothing.

24:46.308 --> 24:47.875
Nobody wants to work with this guy.

24:47.910 --> 24:49.576
You're forgetting our new
friends across the hall.

24:49.612 --> 24:50.978
What? What, are you kidding me?

24:51.013 --> 24:52.713
You think that asshole's
gonna say yes to me?

24:52.749 --> 24:55.616
It's okay. I know
who he'll say yes to.

24:57.553 --> 24:59.153
Hey, Harvey,

24:59.188 --> 25:01.021
I know how tough it's been
not having Mike here,

25:01.057 --> 25:04.258
and I just want to let you
know that I miss him too.

25:04.293 --> 25:06.093
I appreciate that, Louis, but
you didn't have to say it,

25:06.129 --> 25:07.694
because actions speak louder than words,

25:07.730 --> 25:10.231
and you doing this says it all.

25:17.805 --> 25:19.806
Harvey, I've been
looking for you all day.

25:19.841 --> 25:21.307
Well, here I am.

25:21.342 --> 25:23.242
Then maybe you can tell
me why all of a sudden

25:23.278 --> 25:24.744
we're representing William Sutter.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.946
- I changed my mind.
- You changed your mind?

25:26.981 --> 25:30.983
You told me taking Sutter on
would be like selling your soul,

25:31.019 --> 25:32.318
and now you're doing a complete 180.

25:32.353 --> 25:33.319
Jessica, I...

25:33.354 --> 25:35.154
No, Harvey,

25:35.189 --> 25:36.623
I'm not saying I don't like it.

25:36.658 --> 25:38.124
I just want to know what's going on.

25:38.159 --> 25:40.860
Sutter's the one Cahill's after.

25:40.896 --> 25:42.161
You've got to be kidding me.

25:42.196 --> 25:43.863
I shit you not.

25:43.899 --> 25:46.999
Well, I get it.

25:47.035 --> 25:49.001
You give him a full-throttle defense,

25:49.037 --> 25:50.269
gain his trust,

25:50.305 --> 25:52.338
and hope to God Mike cuts his legs out.

25:52.373 --> 25:54.808
Exactly.

25:54.843 --> 25:56.142
What?

25:56.177 --> 25:58.077
Is he gonna give us his
investment business?

25:58.112 --> 25:59.746
Not until after we win.

25:59.781 --> 26:01.247
Which we're hoping we don't.

26:01.282 --> 26:03.783
- Jessica, I have to do this.
- Harvey, relax.

26:03.819 --> 26:05.718
I'm on board. It pays the bills,

26:05.754 --> 26:07.654
and we can leverage it
into more business anyway,

26:07.689 --> 26:09.989
but we'd better leverage it fast,

26:10.024 --> 26:11.825
because losing this case
might be good for Mike,

26:11.860 --> 26:14.060
but it's not gonna be good for us,

26:14.095 --> 26:15.261
and I don't know about you,

26:15.296 --> 26:17.096
but I'd like to get back on top.

26:17.131 --> 26:20.166
There's nothing I'd like more,
which is why I came in here.

26:20.201 --> 26:21.734
What do you need?

26:21.770 --> 26:24.103
I need you to get something
from those traders.

26:29.444 --> 26:31.644
On your feet, Ross.
You're going to solitary.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.179
What? Wait, what are
you talking about?

26:33.214 --> 26:35.147
You heard me. 24 hours, let's go.

26:35.183 --> 26:36.683
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you until you tell me

26:36.718 --> 26:38.485
- what's going on.
- You'll go where I tell you to,

26:38.520 --> 26:40.119
or you'll get acquainted with this.

26:40.154 --> 26:41.821
Listen to me. I just
want to know why...

26:41.857 --> 26:45.525
Next question makes it 48 hours.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.126
You coming or not?

26:49.163 --> 26:50.630
What did you do?

26:58.406 --> 26:59.772
Jessica... good, I caught you.

26:59.808 --> 27:01.440
Rachel, what is it?

27:01.476 --> 27:03.109
Do you remember my
Innocence Project case?

27:03.144 --> 27:05.244
How could I not? Badass Rachel.

27:05.279 --> 27:07.279
Well, thank you.

27:07.315 --> 27:09.115
So I took it, but now they're
saying that it doesn't qualify.

27:09.150 --> 27:10.449
Let me guess.

27:10.485 --> 27:12.218
You want us to take it on as a pro bono.

27:12.253 --> 27:14.286
All I need is one hour
a week of supervision,

27:14.322 --> 27:16.923
and if I need to appear in
court, you come with me.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.892
I know that that's a lot to ask, but...

27:18.927 --> 27:21.761
Rachel, I wish I could tell you
I had an extra hour to give,

27:21.796 --> 27:23.596
- but I don't.
- Jessica, please.

27:23.632 --> 27:25.164
If you would just come with me

27:25.199 --> 27:27.667
- and meet this man...
- No, this is my point.

27:27.702 --> 27:29.936
I just found out we have less
time than I thought we did

27:29.971 --> 27:31.504
to get this firm back on its feet,

27:31.540 --> 27:34.473
and I can't afford to spend
one minute on anything else.

27:34.509 --> 27:35.608
But, I mean, really...

27:35.644 --> 27:40.112
Rachel, I'm sorry.

27:40.148 --> 27:41.948
Now if you'll excuse me.

27:56.631 --> 27:57.964
Thank you.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.933
Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.

27:59.968 --> 28:01.367
- I will.
- You must trust him a lot

28:01.402 --> 28:04.070
to let him in on your
little arrangement.

28:04.105 --> 28:05.805
I do.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.375
He helped me, even though
he doesn't approve of this.

28:09.410 --> 28:10.944
Sounds like you don't either.

28:10.979 --> 28:12.211
It's not up to me to approve or not.

28:12.246 --> 28:14.080
Is that what you came
down here to tell me?

28:14.115 --> 28:15.448
No, I came down here to
tell you I've been doing this

28:15.483 --> 28:17.216
a long time,

28:17.251 --> 28:20.386
and I've seen a lot of
inmates come and go.

28:20.421 --> 28:23.389
These kind of deals, they don't
always work out so well.

28:23.424 --> 28:25.658
You saying you think I'll be
here for the whole two years?

28:25.694 --> 28:29.161
I'm saying I hope it doesn't
turn out even worse than that.

28:49.050 --> 28:51.283
I thought the markets were closed.

28:51.319 --> 28:52.451
Did you ever see "Wall Street"?

28:52.487 --> 28:54.420
Money never sleeps.

28:56.658 --> 29:00.226
- What's this?
- Have a look.

29:00.261 --> 29:01.594
Let me get this straight. I hire you,

29:01.630 --> 29:03.529
and the first thing you do
is come to me for a favor?

29:03.564 --> 29:06.198
I came to you for a favor
when you were my tenant.

29:06.234 --> 29:09.201
Now, as your lawyer, I am coming
to you with an opportunity.

29:09.237 --> 29:10.036
What are you talking about?

29:10.071 --> 29:12.038
That's not a charitable donation.

29:12.073 --> 29:14.040
You do this, you'll get paid for it.

29:14.075 --> 29:15.608
- How much?
- Enough.

29:15.644 --> 29:17.309
How do I know I'm not leaving
something on the table?

29:17.345 --> 29:19.979
Because I never leave
anything on the table.

29:21.482 --> 29:22.982
All right.

29:26.121 --> 29:28.655
You know, I don't get it.

29:28.690 --> 29:30.422
You're obviously a big-time attorney,

29:30.458 --> 29:33.159
and now you're subletting to me.

29:33.194 --> 29:35.294
What the hell happened here?

29:35.329 --> 29:37.730
- You don't know?
- Why would I?

29:37.766 --> 29:40.266
- Google it.
- That bad?

29:40.301 --> 29:42.101
We hired a lawyer.

29:42.137 --> 29:44.837
Turns out he was a fraud.
It ruined our reputation.

29:44.873 --> 29:48.240
Turned out to be a fraud,
or you knew he was a fraud?

29:48.276 --> 29:51.277
Good night, Stu. See
you in the morning.

30:03.324 --> 30:04.924
Warden, what are you...
what are you doing?

30:04.959 --> 30:06.092
Did you know Mike Ross

30:06.127 --> 30:07.459
left the prison grounds the other night?

30:07.495 --> 30:08.761
- What?
- Don't bullshit me.

30:08.797 --> 30:10.296
Did you know his lawyer,
who I understand

30:10.331 --> 30:11.698
is now also your lawyer,

30:11.733 --> 30:13.199
paid someone to get him out of here?

30:13.234 --> 30:14.200
I don't know anything about it.

30:14.235 --> 30:15.601
I suppose if I asked you

30:15.636 --> 30:18.470
who he paid, you'd have the same answer.

30:18.506 --> 30:20.940
I find out you're lying, next time,

30:20.975 --> 30:23.009
you are gonna be the one in solitary,

30:23.044 --> 30:24.944
and it won't be just one night.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.547
- What?
- I'm just thinking about

30:50.583 --> 30:52.148
when this asshole finds out

30:52.184 --> 30:54.618
you're gonna blow his bullshit
suspension out of the water.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.454
William, I am gonna
blow it out of the water,

30:57.490 --> 31:00.858
but I'm gonna need you
to sign this first.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.528
What the hell is Stevens
Investment Group?

31:04.563 --> 31:06.663
It's the company you're
trading through from now on.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.699
Bullshit. They own me?

31:08.734 --> 31:10.133
They don't own anything.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.668
They control you on paper,

31:11.704 --> 31:14.371
and unless you want to shut
down for the next 90 days,

31:14.406 --> 31:15.372
this is what you have to do.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.673
Well, bullshit.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.709
What are you gonna do
if that guy indicts me,

31:18.744 --> 31:20.844
cut a deal where I plead
guilty, and I get probation?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.779
'Cause if this is what
you consider winning,

31:22.815 --> 31:24.381
I might as well find
myself another lawyer.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.651
Okay, gentlemen, I'm
ready to hear arguments,

31:27.686 --> 31:29.285
but I have to tell you,

31:29.321 --> 31:31.555
unless Congress passed
a new law last night,

31:31.590 --> 31:33.156
this suspension stands.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.529
That's okay, Your Honor.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.497
My client's firm is now

31:40.533 --> 31:42.132
the subsidiary of a holding company

31:42.167 --> 31:43.734
with a different trading license.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.802
- What?
- It's all right here.

31:45.838 --> 31:47.170
In that case, I move

31:47.205 --> 31:48.805
to have that company's
license suspended.

31:48.841 --> 31:51.141
And that, right there, is
why I'd like to ask the court

31:51.176 --> 31:52.576
to have Mr. Cahill removed

31:52.611 --> 31:53.744
from any investigation

31:53.779 --> 31:55.311
regarding my client in the future.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.147
Are you out of your mind?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.950
We have an antagonistic
history, Your Honor.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.152
Everyone knows it, and this action

32:02.187 --> 32:03.654
is nothing more than a stunt

32:03.689 --> 32:05.656
designed to punish me through my client.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.957
This is ridiculous.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.792
I've been investigating
William Sutter for 18 months.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.326
And in the last 18 months,

32:10.362 --> 32:11.595
he took no action,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.764
and then yesterday, when I informed him

32:13.799 --> 32:15.265
I am Mr. Sutter's attorney,

32:15.300 --> 32:17.834
within five hours he
suspends his license,

32:17.870 --> 32:20.837
and now he's trying to do it again.

32:20.873 --> 32:22.773
That's what I call a win.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.775
Mr. Cahill, this doesn't look good.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.543
I'm inclined to take you off this case.

32:26.579 --> 32:28.779
Your Honor, Mr. Specter is right.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.781
We have history, but I've been involved

32:30.816 --> 32:32.282
in this case a lot longer than he has.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.284
So if anyone has to be
thrown out for a conflict,

32:34.319 --> 32:35.652
it is him, not me.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.220
I'm not going anywhere, Your Honor.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.488
Then let Mr. Sutter waive

32:38.523 --> 32:39.957
any claims to conflict altogether,

32:39.992 --> 32:41.658
unless, of course, you
want to set a precedent

32:41.694 --> 32:43.860
that any time a defendant
doesn't like his prosecutor,

32:43.896 --> 32:45.295
all he has to do is hire a lawyer

32:45.330 --> 32:47.798
he's gone up against before.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.567
Mr. Sutter, would you
like to keep your attorney

32:50.603 --> 32:52.002
or hire another one, because I am not

32:52.037 --> 32:54.605
taking Mr. Cahill off this case.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.613
Harvey's my guy, Your Honor.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.081
Then unless there's some other issue,

33:04.116 --> 33:06.016
the court has a full docket.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.033
Guard tells you you have a visitor,

33:23.068 --> 33:24.635
doesn't say who it is,
you start thinking

33:24.670 --> 33:27.270
maybe Angelina Jolie opened
your letters after all.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.639
Sit down, Gallo.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.841
You here to make more
false accusations?

33:30.876 --> 33:32.843
I'm here to tell you
that, as of this minute,

33:32.878 --> 33:34.711
I'm your new attorney.

33:34.747 --> 33:35.779
Come again?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.848
You need someone to file that motion.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.716
I'm that someone.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.018
What if I don't want your help?

33:41.053 --> 33:43.820
Well, then you can rot in here
for the rest of your sentence.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.859
It's actually kind of funny, isn't it,

33:48.894 --> 33:50.627
you fighting to get me out

33:50.663 --> 33:53.596
when you fought so hard to put me away.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.931
Must kill you.

33:54.967 --> 33:57.500
Makes me sick to my stomach,

33:57.536 --> 33:59.736
but I'm gonna live with it,

33:59.772 --> 34:01.772
because you're gonna give
me something in return.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.740
Yeah? What's that?

34:03.776 --> 34:05.175
Until this thing goes through,

34:05.210 --> 34:07.778
not only are you gonna
keep your hands off Mike,

34:07.813 --> 34:09.746
you're gonna be his
personal protector in here.

34:09.782 --> 34:10.981
- Bullshit.
- Not bullshit.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.583
He so much as twists
an ankle in the yard,

34:13.618 --> 34:15.318
I'll withdraw that motion.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.587
Now, aren't you forgetting
a little something, champ?

34:17.621 --> 34:19.755
I don't need you to
handle this thing for me.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.925
Now that I know what's what,
I'll get my own attorney.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.127
Yeah, you do that, and
I'll tell the courts

34:24.163 --> 34:27.597
that you just admitted to me
that you tried to poison Mike.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.132
You know how much time that's
gonna add to your sentence?

34:29.168 --> 34:30.801
- I didn't do shit to him!
- Good for you.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.534
Who do you think they're gonna believe,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.137
a former prosecutor like me

34:34.172 --> 34:37.774
or an informant convict like you?

34:37.810 --> 34:40.677
Of course, if I'm your attorney,

34:40.713 --> 34:42.612
I can't tell them any of that.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.717
You son of a bitch.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.717
You set me up.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.020
I sure as hell did.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.956
So it's up to you.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.558
You in or you out?

35:03.168 --> 35:04.601
Can I talk to you a second?

35:04.636 --> 35:06.770
What is it, Louis?

35:06.805 --> 35:07.971
I can't find a house.

35:08.006 --> 35:10.340
A house? What house?

35:10.375 --> 35:11.608
I don't know anything about a house,

35:11.643 --> 35:13.143
certainly not for a person

35:13.178 --> 35:14.845
who doesn't have any
confidence in my ability

35:14.880 --> 35:16.613
to know what he's looking
for in a given situation.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.448
Donna, please, can't we just
pretend that I didn't say

35:18.483 --> 35:19.950
what I said, like we usually do?

35:19.985 --> 35:21.584
No, Louis, we can't,
because I need to know

35:21.620 --> 35:23.686
that you have spent at least
one second contemplating

35:23.722 --> 35:25.655
what your little outburst was about.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.964
I know what it was about.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.431
Really? What is that?

35:37.702 --> 35:40.637
I miss you, Donna.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.307
I miss having you as my secretary.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.545
I miss you too, Louis.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.647
And don't get me wrong.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.681
I'm not saying Gretchen's not great.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.316
Who would?

35:53.351 --> 35:57.487
It's just... I'm just
saying she's not you.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.256
- Who is?
- Nobody.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.297
Was this the kind of
thing you're looking for?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.632
Oh, my God, it's perfect.
Is it still available?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.668
- An offer went in this morning.
- We have to beat it.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.937
No, Louis, we don't.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.438
That offer was yours.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.677
Did they take it?

36:20.712 --> 36:21.812
We find out tomorrow.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.683
- Donna...
- No.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.599
I'm sorry about what
happened with the warden.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.835
Yeah.

36:47.139 --> 36:48.705
If you need anything...

36:48.740 --> 36:49.706
I'll let you know.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.615
Look, I didn't... I didn't tell them

36:59.651 --> 37:02.485
what you told me about
Harvey getting you out.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.787
I need you to know that.
It's important to me.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.257
Yeah, whatever you say, Kevin.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.595
I know I haven't told you
why I'm in here, Mike...

37:15.800 --> 37:17.567
But you don't understand.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.769
From the second I got
here, I've had to watch

37:19.804 --> 37:22.973
what I say, every single word,

37:23.008 --> 37:24.174
and every morning I get up,

37:24.209 --> 37:25.742
and I remind myself

37:25.777 --> 37:28.111
not to say the wrong thing
to the wrong person,

37:28.146 --> 37:31.681
and every night I go to bed and think,

37:31.716 --> 37:33.516
"Another day down where I didn't."

37:33.551 --> 37:37.120
Yeah, you think I don't
know what that's like?

37:37.155 --> 37:39.256
I've been living a lie
every day for years.

37:39.291 --> 37:43.193
Yeah, but you were just
protecting yourself.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.728
You don't have a family.

37:49.667 --> 37:53.270
Kevin, what did you do?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.977
I got in a fight with my wife.

38:02.647 --> 38:04.981
It was...

38:05.017 --> 38:07.550
it was bad.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.552
We said things to each other
we never said before.

38:09.587 --> 38:13.656
I went out.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.959
I got drunk.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.394
I got into my car,

38:17.429 --> 38:22.098
and I almost killed someone.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.766
Next thing I knew, I
woke up in an ambulance,

38:23.802 --> 38:25.501
looking up at a police officer.

38:28.506 --> 38:29.806
What?

38:29.841 --> 38:33.009
I made one stupid,

38:33.045 --> 38:34.844
stupid mistake.

38:37.715 --> 38:41.684
And it's gonna cost me three
years with my family,

38:41.719 --> 38:44.620
and it's not just the
special things, man.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.489
I'm missing a thousand chances

38:46.524 --> 38:49.659
to hug my kids in the morning...

38:49.694 --> 38:52.795
And kiss my wife good night,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.898
all because I couldn't control myself.

38:58.070 --> 39:01.037
What were you fighting
with your wife about?

39:01.073 --> 39:04.240
What do you mean, you were
trying to protect your family?

39:04.276 --> 39:05.541
Kevin.

39:05.577 --> 39:09.712
I... yeah, I can't.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.114
I just can't.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.570
Okay.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.639
I'll do it.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.841
- Excuse me?
- Your pro bono.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.610
Bring me the file tomorrow morning.

39:42.014 --> 39:45.415
Jessica, I'm sorry.
Can I just ask why?

39:45.450 --> 39:47.517
What does it matter?

39:47.552 --> 39:49.352
It matters to me.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.653
I've been out all day,

39:50.688 --> 39:54.590
trying to drum up business,
and it hasn't been easy.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.792
So from now on, when
people Google our name,

39:56.828 --> 39:59.429
I'd rather they see,

39:59.464 --> 40:03.633
"innocent man freed by Pearson Specter"

40:03.668 --> 40:06.269
than "Manhattan law firm hires a fraud."

40:07.805 --> 40:10.040
Thank you.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.707
Good night, Rachel.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.716
What are you doing here, Sean?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.785
You know what I'm doing here.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.819
What were you thinking,

40:23.855 --> 40:24.987
trying to get me thrown off my own case?

40:25.023 --> 40:26.523
He was coming at me.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.324
I had to do something to keep his trust.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.660
Well, for your information,
if I get thrown off this case,

40:30.695 --> 40:32.695
that deal that you don't know
about getting that certain

40:32.730 --> 40:34.797
someone out early doesn't exist anymore.

40:34.832 --> 40:37.333
- You think I don't know that?
- No, I don't think you do,

40:37.369 --> 40:39.235
because if I hadn't pulled
that shit out of my ass,

40:39.271 --> 40:41.904
this whole thing would've
been for nothing.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.140
What are you so pleased
with yourself about?

40:44.176 --> 40:45.708
Nothing. It's just...

40:45.743 --> 40:47.843
you didn't want me to take this case,

40:47.879 --> 40:49.212
and now you're getting pissed at me

40:49.247 --> 40:53.015
because I'm too good a
job defending my client.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.685
Now that you put it that way...

40:55.720 --> 40:57.454
It was a good fix, Sean.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.624
- It was a good move, Harvey.
- Want to get a drink?

41:01.659 --> 41:02.625
Why don't we just have one here?

41:02.660 --> 41:03.993
This might be the last one

41:04.028 --> 41:05.995
that we have together for a long time.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.630
Why? As of right now,

41:07.665 --> 41:09.966
you have no action pending
against my client.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.768
But as of tomorrow, I do,

41:12.804 --> 41:15.105
'cause those indictments are
coming down in the morning.
