01:22.625 --> 01:25.438
Welcome to Mexico, Agent Gibbs.

01:25.462 --> 01:29.398
Don't even think about it.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.210
Following this year's

02:04.234 --> 02:05.545
inspirational
commencement speech,

02:05.569 --> 02:08.681
the 2010 U.S. Naval Academy
graduating class began

02:08.705 --> 02:11.651
- their weekend-long celebration.
- Good times.

02:11.675 --> 02:13.319
And, never to be outdone,

02:13.343 --> 02:15.054
the city of Annapolis hopes
to make it

02:15.078 --> 02:16.522
a graduation to remember...

02:16.546 --> 02:18.724
Ah, graduation.

02:18.748 --> 02:20.493
For many,
an alcohol-induced purple haze.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.628
Easy there, Hendrix, it'll pass.

02:22.652 --> 02:25.431
Back when I was on Baltimore
P.D., every graduation,

02:25.455 --> 02:26.866
you'd go down to the drunk tank

02:26.890 --> 02:29.402
and there'd be a hundred seniors
throwing up on themselves.

02:29.426 --> 02:30.837
Good times.

02:30.861 --> 02:33.673
Need I remind you that I, too,
will become a graduate soon?

02:33.697 --> 02:35.208
With a degree in what?

02:35.232 --> 02:36.809
English as a tenth language.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.512
My naturalization interview
is this week,

02:39.536 --> 02:41.647
both the written and oral exams.

02:41.671 --> 02:43.749
It is how an alien
becomes a citizen.

02:43.773 --> 02:45.651
Oh, I know what it means, E.T.

02:45.675 --> 02:47.040
You ready?

02:48.078 --> 02:50.289
I think so.

02:50.313 --> 02:52.304
Ask me anything.

02:53.350 --> 02:55.661
Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution

02:55.685 --> 02:57.020
of the United States.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.066
Due process.

03:00.090 --> 03:02.702
No person shall be held
to answer for any

03:02.726 --> 03:05.104
capital crime, unless indicted
by a grand jury.

03:05.128 --> 03:06.105
- Ha.
- Nice.

03:06.129 --> 03:08.040
Not bad, David, not bad at all.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.775
DiNozzo, eighth letter
of the alphabet.

03:09.799 --> 03:11.077
- "G."
- No, "H"

03:11.101 --> 03:12.111
for homicide.

03:12.135 --> 03:13.546
Got one on the beach
in Annapolis.

03:13.570 --> 03:14.547
Could be academy-related.

03:14.571 --> 03:16.215
Let's go.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.764
One minute, Gibbs.

03:20.777 --> 03:22.922
Every TV station in D.C.'ll
be covering

03:22.946 --> 03:24.524
the Annapolis graduation
this week,

03:24.548 --> 03:26.792
so until we know something,

03:26.816 --> 03:28.294
let's keep this on the down-low.

03:28.318 --> 03:32.220
Keep what on the down-low,
Director?

03:44.201 --> 03:45.645
Hell of a way to go.

03:45.669 --> 03:47.713
It smells like mesquite.

03:47.737 --> 03:50.316
Who are you... Bobby Flay?

03:50.340 --> 03:53.452
I'm just saying, certain woods
burn differently than others.

03:53.476 --> 03:54.687
There's still green out here.

03:54.711 --> 03:55.888
That's why it's smoldering.

03:55.912 --> 03:58.257
Hmm, it is perfect for s'mores.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.258
Never liked s'mores.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.826
What are you talking about?

04:00.850 --> 04:01.961
What's not to like?

04:01.985 --> 04:03.729
You got your chocolate,

04:03.753 --> 04:06.465
graham crackers,
gooey marshmallows.

04:06.489 --> 04:08.650
What kind of Boy Scout are you?

04:10.060 --> 04:11.737
I'm a Webelos, actually.

04:11.761 --> 04:12.805
Well, zip up, Webelos.

04:12.829 --> 04:14.228
Your inner geek is showing.

04:15.932 --> 04:17.743
Are you sure you didn't see
something last night,

04:17.767 --> 04:18.744
Ensign Bosch?

04:18.767 --> 04:20.379
No, sir.

04:20.403 --> 04:22.915
The fire was ready to go
when we got here.

04:22.939 --> 04:24.350
I set it up the night before,

04:24.374 --> 04:26.619
so we could just drop a match
and party.

04:26.643 --> 04:29.155
And you think someone came
during the night

04:29.179 --> 04:32.124
and deliberately hid
the body underneath?

04:32.148 --> 04:33.479
Had to have, ma'am.

04:34.517 --> 04:36.553
You feeling all right?

04:37.554 --> 04:38.631
Tired, sir.

04:38.655 --> 04:41.852
I've been up all night
celebrating.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.462
Go get some sleep.
We'll be in touch.

04:48.131 --> 04:50.009
"Whenever
a good nor'wester blows,

04:50.033 --> 04:54.480
Christopher is certain
to have sand between the toes."

04:54.504 --> 04:56.182
And who exactly is Christopher?

04:56.206 --> 04:58.551
He's a creation of A.A. Milne,

04:58.575 --> 05:01.654
who, reputedly, also liked
a good romp on the beach.

05:01.678 --> 05:04.824
Well, well, well, well...

05:04.848 --> 05:07.693
This one put up quite a fight.

05:07.717 --> 05:10.496
Fingernails are broken
at the cuticle.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.898
Heat has cooked off

05:12.922 --> 05:16.722
most of the flesh, but not all.

05:18.128 --> 05:20.773
Killers often assume
that a good fire

05:20.797 --> 05:25.044
will... act like a crematorium.

05:25.068 --> 05:27.380
They are unaware that it is

05:27.404 --> 05:30.950
impossible to generate
the necessary temperature.

05:30.974 --> 05:33.085
See that?
Wood wasn't hot enough.

05:33.109 --> 05:34.701
Well, thank you,
Wee Willy Webelos.

05:36.046 --> 05:39.025
Do you have your portable
fingerprint scanner with you,

05:39.049 --> 05:41.694
- Timothy?
- Uh, yeah, I believe I do.

05:41.718 --> 05:43.562
Thank you.

05:43.586 --> 05:47.066
By rehydrating
the heat-dried digit

05:47.090 --> 05:51.437
with saline,
the swirls and ridges regain

05:51.461 --> 05:53.906
definition,
possibly allowing us to get

05:53.930 --> 05:55.241
an identification.

05:55.265 --> 05:57.096
It's like watering a mummy.

06:06.609 --> 06:08.372
Anything?

06:12.482 --> 06:14.126
Words, McGee.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.983
Boss, this is
Special Agent Lara Macy.

06:33.402 --> 06:36.248
According to Special
Agent Macy's personnel file, she

06:36.272 --> 06:39.384
left the L.A. office last year
under special circumstances.

06:39.408 --> 06:42.287
Was transferred to the
Force Protection Detachment

06:42.311 --> 06:43.288
in Marseille.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.290
You're supposed to feel
safer on American soil.

06:45.314 --> 06:47.292
That could have happened
anywhere, to any of us.

06:47.316 --> 06:49.294
That is the risk we take.

06:49.318 --> 06:50.963
The agency's on alert.

06:50.987 --> 06:52.765
The director has ordered
a threat assessment.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.233
So now what?

06:54.257 --> 06:55.634
We assess.

06:55.658 --> 06:57.770
Figure out who killed
another female federal agent.

06:57.794 --> 07:00.339
And uphold justice
to the full extent of the law.

07:00.363 --> 07:02.875
Or whatever it takes.

07:02.899 --> 07:05.110
Okay, she's a marine,

07:05.134 --> 07:07.346
an agent, a daughter.

07:07.370 --> 07:10.415
All right, daughter first.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.284
Macy's mom lives on a farm
in Cumberland, Maryland.

07:12.308 --> 07:13.652
Call her, tell her we're coming.

07:13.676 --> 07:16.179
- On it.
- David.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.359
Right away.

07:20.383 --> 07:22.294
Gibbs, a member of Special Agent.

07:22.318 --> 07:25.549
Macy's team from Marseille
is calling in to MTAC.

07:26.656 --> 07:28.133
Threat assessment's
been put out.

07:28.157 --> 07:29.317
Think they know?

07:33.162 --> 07:35.741
Special Agent Macy left
four days ago, sir.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.242
A flight from De Gaulle
to Dulles,

07:37.266 --> 07:38.844
aboard a C-130 transport.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.312
Do you know why she left?

07:40.336 --> 07:42.930
Said she needed
some personal time.

07:47.410 --> 07:49.605
Special Agent Macy is dead.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.679
We found her here at Annapolis
early this morning.

07:54.951 --> 07:56.195
Lara?

07:56.219 --> 07:58.997
How? What happened?

07:59.021 --> 08:01.033
She was murdered.

08:01.057 --> 08:03.001
On my watch, Agent Mineoux.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.070
So if you think
this is case-related,

08:05.094 --> 08:07.172
I'm gonna need every document,
every file

08:07.196 --> 08:08.740
that you can get your hands on.

08:08.764 --> 08:11.743
Of course.
We'll send everything.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.146
But it doesn't make sense.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.480
Who would want her dead?

08:15.504 --> 08:16.648
You check her apartment.

08:16.672 --> 08:18.350
You check her phone records
and her mail.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.586
Any idea where she was staying
while she was here?

08:20.610 --> 08:23.946
Uh, she said I could reach her
at a hotel in Norfolk.

08:24.947 --> 08:26.676
The Freemont Inn.

08:27.783 --> 08:29.828
This is a great loss for us,
Director.

08:29.852 --> 08:31.430
The whole agency.

08:31.454 --> 08:33.999
You have no idea.

08:34.023 --> 08:36.101
It's just us. So tell me...

08:36.125 --> 08:38.669
who did this wretched
thing to you?

08:38.693 --> 08:41.573
Did it merely coincide
with your line of work,

08:41.597 --> 08:43.708
or was it caused by it?

08:43.732 --> 08:46.678
Your silence speaks volumes.

08:46.702 --> 08:48.413
It's amazing
how someone so demure

08:48.437 --> 08:50.849
can say so much with so little.

08:50.873 --> 08:52.351
You're talking
to yourself again, Duck.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.920
On the contrary.
Agent Macy is enlightening me.

08:54.944 --> 08:55.954
Take a look at this.

08:55.978 --> 09:00.125
There's a bone chip
on the anterior side

09:00.149 --> 09:01.793
of the C-4 vertebra.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.896
I believe a serrated knife

09:03.920 --> 09:06.465
was pulled violently
up and across her neck,

09:06.489 --> 09:08.967
practically severing it
from the spinal column.

09:08.991 --> 09:10.502
Macy could hold her own.

09:10.526 --> 09:11.904
Professional hit?

09:11.928 --> 09:13.572
Well, certainly looks like it.

09:13.596 --> 09:17.142
If someone wanted her dead,
why wait until she got home?

09:17.166 --> 09:22.968
And why set her remains ablaze
in NCIS jurisdiction?

09:29.812 --> 09:31.556
Hey, Abbs, what do you got?

09:31.580 --> 09:33.325
Questions. For you.

09:33.349 --> 09:34.646
Case first.

09:36.352 --> 09:39.064
Okay, um, people only travel
for two reasons...

09:39.088 --> 09:40.933
business or pleasure.

09:40.957 --> 09:42.935
If Agent Macy was traveling
for pleasure,

09:42.959 --> 09:45.237
then why didn't she stay
at her mom's house in Maryland?

09:45.261 --> 09:47.005
Instead, she checked
into an impersonal motel

09:47.029 --> 09:49.675
and everything we collected from
her room is work-related, so...

09:49.699 --> 09:51.944
Work-related items,
work-related visit.

09:51.968 --> 09:53.745
That's her NCIS laptop.

09:53.769 --> 09:55.747
And that's her work cell phone.

09:55.771 --> 09:56.915
Last call?

09:56.939 --> 09:59.418
It was incoming,
from early last evening.

09:59.442 --> 10:01.153
From a store-bought disposable.

10:01.177 --> 10:02.387
I'm trying to track it now.

10:02.411 --> 10:03.488
What's really interesting

10:03.512 --> 10:05.357
are the five calls
that Agent Macy made

10:05.381 --> 10:07.259
in the last three days.

10:07.283 --> 10:09.461
All to a Petty Officer
Kaylen Burrows.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.495
Pull the file.

10:10.519 --> 10:12.214
I already did.

10:15.691 --> 10:17.636
Burrows is currently stationed

10:17.660 --> 10:19.338
on the USS Majestic.

10:19.362 --> 10:21.239
It's been docked
outside Marseille

10:21.263 --> 10:22.708
until a few weeks ago,

10:22.732 --> 10:24.609
and then made port in Norfolk

10:24.633 --> 10:26.845
at the same time
that Agent Macy did.

10:26.869 --> 10:29.648
Agent Macy followed
Burrows back to the States.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.649
Business...

10:30.673 --> 10:32.150
- Not pleasure.
- Hmm.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.953
Gibbs, speaking of business,

10:34.977 --> 10:36.655
we need to talk.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.490
About...

10:38.514 --> 10:41.693
stuff and... things.

10:41.717 --> 10:43.514
Not now, Abbs.

10:45.488 --> 10:47.217
Okay.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.755
Okay.

10:55.064 --> 10:56.775
Oh! Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

10:56.799 --> 10:59.378
Miss Hart, still not used
to you wandering around.

10:59.402 --> 11:01.700
Oh. I got a pass now, remember?

11:05.574 --> 11:07.052
Limited access.

11:07.076 --> 11:08.387
Your client...

11:08.411 --> 11:11.757
Colonel Bell...
he'll be disappointed.

11:11.781 --> 11:13.725
Well, this isn't
about the colonel.

11:13.749 --> 11:16.061
Actually, I'm on my way
to see Ms. Sciuto.

11:16.085 --> 11:18.096
The Mexican government
wants their body back.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.732
It's just a drug dealer.

11:20.756 --> 11:22.868
Maybe, but if you had
an unsolved case,

11:22.892 --> 11:24.569
you'd want
your evidence back, too.

11:24.593 --> 11:27.372
You'd better get to work.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.708
Do you want to grab
some dinner later?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.410
Uh... no, I can't.

11:31.434 --> 11:32.594
Beer?

11:33.636 --> 11:35.781
No. Can't do that, either.

11:35.805 --> 11:37.783
If I didn't know
any better, Mr. Gibbs,

11:37.807 --> 11:39.206
I'd think you were avoiding me.

11:47.083 --> 11:50.095
Something smells good.

11:50.119 --> 11:51.897
Oh, yeah.

11:51.921 --> 11:53.065
You like mashed potatoes?

11:53.089 --> 11:54.866
We are not here to eat, Tony.

11:54.890 --> 11:56.368
Well, I mourn, I eat.

11:56.392 --> 11:57.736
I'm Italian.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.806
Jews and Italians
are similar that way.

12:00.830 --> 12:03.196
That's her.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.577
Petty Officer Burrows?

12:05.601 --> 12:06.878
Yes.

12:06.902 --> 12:09.181
NCIS. This is Agent David,
I'm Agent DiNozzo.

12:09.205 --> 12:10.282
Can we talk?

12:10.306 --> 12:12.017
I'm running a little late.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.843
I have a quarterdeck watch
to start.

12:16.345 --> 12:17.956
How's the flan?

12:17.980 --> 12:19.925
The what?

12:19.949 --> 12:22.094
Custard-like dessert
on your plate there.

12:22.118 --> 12:24.096
It's tough to master the flan.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.431
Texture needs to be smooth.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.500
Just the right ratio of milk

12:28.524 --> 12:30.602
to vanilla to caramel.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.170
Can we stop talking
about the flan?

12:32.194 --> 12:33.286
What are you, anti-flan?

12:34.663 --> 12:36.108
Will you tell us what happened

12:36.132 --> 12:39.397
between you and Special Agent
Macy in Marseille?

12:40.970 --> 12:42.747
I don't know who that is.

12:42.771 --> 12:43.982
Sure, you do.

12:44.006 --> 12:47.085
You guys spoke this week...
five times.

12:47.109 --> 12:48.920
Uh, Petty Officer,

12:48.944 --> 12:50.846
we need to go.
We're gonna be late for muster.

12:52.348 --> 12:55.260
That's kind of cute how you guys
all look out for each other.

12:55.284 --> 12:56.428
And you ate all your flan.

12:56.452 --> 12:57.596
Well done, big boy.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.498
This is a private conversation.

12:59.522 --> 13:01.466
Well, this is
a U.S. Naval vessel, ma'am,

13:01.490 --> 13:02.701
and we have responsibilities.

13:02.725 --> 13:03.987
And so do we.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.805
She'll meet you up on deck.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.697
Gentlemen.

13:12.268 --> 13:13.478
DiNozzo.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.880
I did it!

13:14.904 --> 13:15.881
Did what?

13:15.905 --> 13:17.616
I busted through the back door

13:17.640 --> 13:19.017
of Agent Macy's
encrypted laptop.

13:19.041 --> 13:22.354
Okay. Agent Macy had started
a case file,

13:22.378 --> 13:25.023
but she never turned it in,
because it was incomplete.

13:25.047 --> 13:26.491
- Why?
- The victim in the crime

13:26.515 --> 13:27.826
refused to testify.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.661
As a matter of fact,

13:29.685 --> 13:32.130
the victim refused
to cooperate at all.

13:32.154 --> 13:33.781
And who was the victim, exactly?

13:34.857 --> 13:38.384
Petty Officer Second Class
Kaylen Burrows.

13:42.164 --> 13:43.324
And what was the crime?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.924
Rape.

13:57.078 --> 13:59.924
Tell us what happened
in France, Kaylen.

13:59.948 --> 14:02.960
Nothing you say
will leave this room.

14:02.984 --> 14:04.895
You can't promise that, ma'am.

14:04.919 --> 14:07.264
No disrespect,

14:07.288 --> 14:11.202
but I've been in this Navy
too long.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.160
I know better.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.612
According to the ship's log,

14:21.636 --> 14:24.982
you had a 24-hour liberty
in Marseille.

14:25.006 --> 14:26.383
It's a fun town.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.618
I guess.

14:27.642 --> 14:30.654
A little Bordeaux,
a little cognac.

14:30.678 --> 14:31.946
Things went too far?

14:34.015 --> 14:37.261
I met someone, we partied.

14:37.285 --> 14:40.931
I'm as responsible as anyone.

14:40.955 --> 14:43.367
Can anybody verify that?

14:43.391 --> 14:45.369
It seems your shipmates,

14:45.393 --> 14:48.005
Capetanos and Wachter,
were on liberty as well.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.207
Why did they not want you
to talk to us?

14:50.231 --> 14:52.009
What I did is my business.

14:52.033 --> 14:54.645
Look...

14:54.669 --> 14:57.069
you were attacked.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.075
I'm not pressing any charges.

15:02.810 --> 15:05.756
Yeah, I told Agent Macy
the same thing.

15:05.780 --> 15:09.093
I just... want to go back
to the Majestic now.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.119
Well...

15:12.654 --> 15:14.565
No can do.

15:14.589 --> 15:16.600
Why?

15:16.624 --> 15:19.937
Because you're also a witness
in a murder investigation.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.759
That's im... that's impossible.

15:24.832 --> 15:26.944
Who?

15:26.968 --> 15:29.266
Special Agent Lara Macy.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.119
I've already approved the return

15:35.143 --> 15:37.488
of Pedro Hernandez's body
back to Mexico.

15:37.512 --> 15:40.157
Your liaison,
Ms. Hart, has agreed

15:40.181 --> 15:42.126
to make the transportation
arrangements.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.961
The evidence should be
on its way

15:43.985 --> 15:45.562
in a few days, Mr. Rivera.

15:45.586 --> 15:49.566
My government and I very much
appreciate your assistance,

15:49.590 --> 15:52.169
Director Vance, especially
loaning us Ms. Sciuto.

15:52.193 --> 15:55.339
Her visit was illuminating,
to say the least.

15:55.363 --> 15:58.409
Well, I think Ms. Sciuto enjoyed
her time in your country, too,

15:58.433 --> 15:59.843
for the most part.

15:59.867 --> 16:02.270
Let me videoconference her in.

16:08.443 --> 16:09.687
Ms. Sciuto?

16:09.711 --> 16:11.522
Buenas noches, everyone.

16:11.546 --> 16:14.258
Abby, I am still amazed
that you've managed

16:14.282 --> 16:17.328
to make progress
on such an old case.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.663
I am very much looking forward
to reading your report.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.931
So am I.

16:20.955 --> 16:22.299
Well, see,

16:22.323 --> 16:24.168
that-that's what
I wanted to mention.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.770
'Cause I really need
a little more time with it.

16:26.794 --> 16:29.340
You know, just to make sure
I did a thorough job.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.524
I mean, it's-it's...

16:33.234 --> 16:37.648
I need to double-check
and triple-check everything.

16:37.672 --> 16:40.784
Señor Rivera, you'll have
that report as soon as possible.

16:40.808 --> 16:43.787
We did just lose an agent,
Director,

16:43.811 --> 16:45.222
and that does take priority.

16:45.246 --> 16:47.324
It's certainly a priority
of mine.

16:47.348 --> 16:49.693
I'm sorry, Director Vance.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.629
I know what it's like to lose
people fighting for a cause.

16:52.653 --> 16:54.832
- We face it every day.
- Thank you.

16:54.856 --> 16:58.602
Alejandro, I swear I'll get it
to you as soon as I can.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.404
Oh, of course, Abby.

17:00.428 --> 17:03.841
I hate to see so much
on that brilliant mind of yours.

17:03.865 --> 17:05.976
The case has been dormant
for 20 years.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.525
A few more days cannot hurt.

17:09.936 --> 17:11.506
Thank you, Ms. Sciuto.

17:21.516 --> 17:23.594
Did you know my daughter well?

17:23.617 --> 17:27.164
Well, unfortunately,
I only got to meet her one time.

17:27.188 --> 17:29.486
She was an outstanding agent.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.260
Good person.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.942
Um, it's excellent tea, ma'am.

17:38.966 --> 17:40.844
It was her favorite.

17:40.868 --> 17:45.416
Lara and I used to sit
with a pot and talk for hours.

17:45.440 --> 17:50.377
Funny how a cup of tea
can mean so much.

17:51.813 --> 17:54.858
We're gonna need
to go through her belongings.

17:54.882 --> 17:58.996
Well, everything
in Lara's room's

17:59.020 --> 18:00.531
exactly as she left it.

18:00.555 --> 18:04.116
Clothes in the closet date
all the way back to high school.

18:05.827 --> 18:10.230
But I already showed your people
everything.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.644
Not our people, ma'am.

18:13.668 --> 18:15.779
Yes. There was a...
a man here earlier.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.481
He couldn't have been nicer.

18:17.505 --> 18:19.817
Can you describe him?

18:19.841 --> 18:22.152
Handsome. Military.

18:22.176 --> 18:24.922
After he went through her room,

18:24.946 --> 18:28.158
I showed him the-the mud room
off the kitchen.

18:28.182 --> 18:30.828
That's where
she kept her papers and...

18:30.852 --> 18:33.286
whatnot.

18:35.022 --> 18:38.617
Oh, dear, he left quite a mess.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.406
All of this is Lara's?

18:42.430 --> 18:43.941
Most of it.

18:43.965 --> 18:46.777
Amazing what we collect
over the years.

18:46.801 --> 18:49.980
I really need to get in here
and go through these things.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.748
So many memories.

18:51.772 --> 18:54.651
Wow. Agent Macy's
personal notes.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.386
There's years of them here.

18:56.410 --> 19:00.278
All dating back to when she was
an MP at Pendleton.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.330
Box it. All of it, McGee.
Check the dates.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.731
See if anything's missing.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.000
Try to figure out
what this guy's looking for.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.219
Anything in particular?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.356
Just check it.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.146
Get a sketch artist out there.
Let's I.D. this guy.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.581
I already made the call,

19:24.605 --> 19:25.749
- but I can make it again...
- DiNozzo.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.150
Making it again, boss.

19:27.174 --> 19:28.174
Come on, chew.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.075
What do you got from overseas?

19:32.079 --> 19:34.424
Agents spoke to the owner
of the bar that Burrows was in

19:34.448 --> 19:35.993
- the night of the rape.
- Swallow.

19:36.017 --> 19:38.862
Remembers an American civilian
hanging with her.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.764
Young guy, big mouth,
big drinker.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.366
Does he got a name?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.067
Uh, yes.

19:44.091 --> 19:46.203
Used a credit card to, uh,

19:46.227 --> 19:47.271
run his bank statements,

19:47.295 --> 19:50.407
and came up
with a Tyler Hammond,

19:50.431 --> 19:52.175
22, out of Chevy Chase.

19:52.199 --> 19:55.746
His dad... Randall,

19:55.770 --> 19:57.281
is a big muckety-muck

19:57.305 --> 19:58.549
builder in D.C.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.117
He founded
Derby Winner Construction.

20:00.141 --> 20:02.386
They've got sites
all over the city.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.954
Junior finished
Georgetown last year.

20:03.978 --> 20:05.756
Kicked around for a little bit,
and then Mommy and Daddy

20:05.780 --> 20:07.925
got tired of his face; Sent him
to Europe for three months.

20:07.949 --> 20:09.426
- He still in Europe?
- Negatory.

20:09.450 --> 20:10.827
Flew back a week ago.

20:10.851 --> 20:12.129
Tyler's home now.

20:12.153 --> 20:13.597
Maybe Agent Macy
went to see him.

20:13.621 --> 20:15.899
Maybe she got too close.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.585
Take Ziva. Bring him in.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.172
This community relies
on its police department,

20:22.196 --> 20:24.041
and this is the kind
of support we get?

20:24.065 --> 20:25.876
I know you're
chief of police, but

20:25.900 --> 20:28.312
I pay a lot of taxes to keep
this neighborhood safe.

20:28.336 --> 20:30.280
Now, I want you to find
those men. Do you hear me?!

20:30.304 --> 20:31.715
- Yes, sir.
- What is going on here?

20:31.739 --> 20:34.151
It's a nice fountain.
It's very Caesars Palace.

20:34.175 --> 20:35.886
Hey, guys. You Tyler Hammond?

20:35.910 --> 20:37.321
Who the hell are you?

20:37.345 --> 20:39.289
NCIS.

20:39.313 --> 20:41.491
Damn Navy. Where were you
a few minutes ago?

20:41.515 --> 20:44.279
Can you tell us what's going on?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.698
A couple of guys
in ski masks pulled up

20:47.722 --> 20:49.399
and beat the daylights
out of my son.

20:49.423 --> 20:50.801
Well, that's not good.

20:50.825 --> 20:53.003
Can you describe
these guys, Tyler?

20:53.027 --> 20:55.172
Big.

20:55.196 --> 20:56.673
I never saw them coming.

20:56.697 --> 20:59.076
So you did not see their faces?

20:59.100 --> 21:00.577
Didn't need to.

21:00.601 --> 21:02.212
They took off in an SUV

21:02.236 --> 21:04.181
with Navy base permits
on the glass.

21:04.205 --> 21:06.617
Couple of respectable
military guys

21:06.641 --> 21:07.985
beating up an innocent kid.

21:08.009 --> 21:09.620
You know, I have friends
at the Pentagon.

21:09.644 --> 21:10.921
I'm going to call my lawyer.

21:10.945 --> 21:12.422
And I'm going to sue you people.

21:12.446 --> 21:14.291
Okay. All right.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.326
Why don't you call Gibbs,
give him a heads-up?

21:16.350 --> 21:18.409
Tell him our attacker's
been attacked.

21:29.696 --> 21:32.108
Special Agent Gibbs.

21:32.132 --> 21:34.143
How you feeling, Tyler?

21:34.167 --> 21:36.145
We've been waiting
for you for over an hour.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.747
It's nice of you
to finally show.

21:37.771 --> 21:39.449
Busy day, Mr. Hammond.

21:39.473 --> 21:40.984
Maybe you need to get
your priorities straight,

21:41.008 --> 21:42.485
Special Agent Gibbs.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.120
Look what they did to my son.

21:44.144 --> 21:45.788
Who, exactly?

21:45.812 --> 21:47.790
Navy guys.

21:47.814 --> 21:49.058
Your Navy.

21:49.082 --> 21:51.494
I was walking to my car.
They grabbed me and...

21:51.518 --> 21:52.962
You don't need to say
any more, Tyler.

21:52.986 --> 21:55.431
That's sound advice.
Who are you?

21:55.455 --> 21:58.601
Marshall Tomko,
Mr. Hammond's attorney.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.770
Well, you're right, Mr. Tomko.

22:00.794 --> 22:02.739
Tyler, you don't have

22:02.763 --> 22:03.906
to say anything else.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.441
It makes you look guilty.

22:05.465 --> 22:08.745
My son didn't do anything wrong.

22:08.769 --> 22:10.913
That's not what
Petty Officer Burrows says.

22:10.937 --> 22:13.249
I know all about her,
her little story.

22:13.273 --> 22:15.151
She's lying.

22:15.175 --> 22:17.020
Mr. Hammond,
if your son's so clean,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.321
why'd two Navy sailors

22:18.345 --> 22:20.023
drive all the way out here
to kick his ass?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.325
Because Tyler Hammond
witnessed them rape

22:22.349 --> 22:24.294
one of their own
that evening in Marseille.

22:24.318 --> 22:26.996
He tried to stop it,
but couldn't.

22:27.020 --> 22:29.198
That's not
the petty officer's story.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.167
She's afraid, intimidated.

22:31.191 --> 22:33.202
They're on that ship
together, 24/7.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.305
They know
that Tyler can I.D. them.

22:35.329 --> 22:36.539
They're scared he'll talk,

22:36.563 --> 22:38.441
and they're desperate.

22:38.465 --> 22:40.456
It's a theory.

22:42.336 --> 22:44.634
How about you, Tyler?
You got an opinion?

22:48.041 --> 22:50.987
My son just wanted to help.

22:51.011 --> 22:52.979
And this is the thanks he gets.

22:57.884 --> 22:59.228
What if our lawyer is right?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.797
What if her shipmates did do it?

23:00.821 --> 23:03.766
Then I understand
why Petty Officer Burrows

23:03.790 --> 23:05.268
has kept her mouth shut.

23:05.292 --> 23:06.703
I don't.

23:06.727 --> 23:08.438
Why would you let someone
get away with rape?

23:08.462 --> 23:09.739
Perception.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.407
Burrows is in the military.

23:11.431 --> 23:15.011
If a woman cries rape, no man
on that ship would ever

23:15.035 --> 23:16.479
totally trust her again.

23:16.503 --> 23:18.581
Well, you're a woman.
What would you do?

23:18.605 --> 23:20.083
I'm different.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.151
After torturing them

23:22.175 --> 23:23.753
until they cried like babies,

23:23.777 --> 23:25.588
I would castrate them.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.924
Give them what they deserve.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.094
Hmm. Spoken like a true
almost-American.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.029
Background check. I'm listening.

23:33.053 --> 23:34.530
Wachter and Capetanos

23:34.554 --> 23:36.766
both show some teenage offenses.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.634
Both were on 24-hour liberty
from the Majestic

23:38.658 --> 23:40.903
- the night Macy was killed.
- And Seaman Wachter

23:40.927 --> 23:43.840
did sign out a motor pool van
earlier today.

23:43.864 --> 23:45.908
It's possible Burrows
is being strong-armed.

23:45.932 --> 23:48.411
And when Macy started snooping,
they killed her, too?

23:48.435 --> 23:49.879
Agent Macy's investigation

23:49.903 --> 23:51.347
shows a hospital rape kit

23:51.371 --> 23:54.016
was administered the morning
after Burrows was attacked.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.551
Swabs, blood work, everything.

23:55.575 --> 23:57.186
Were the results determined?

23:57.210 --> 23:58.588
You can't tell from here.

23:58.612 --> 24:00.123
When Burrows backed off
the case,

24:00.147 --> 24:01.591
the results were never posted.

24:01.615 --> 24:03.559
Have Abby check with
the infirmary on the Majestic.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.027
See if that rape kit's
still there.

24:05.051 --> 24:06.462
You talk to those enlisted guys.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.463
Already did it, boss.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.265
Do it again!

24:09.289 --> 24:11.052
Doing it again, boss.

24:15.095 --> 24:16.739
NCIS.

24:16.763 --> 24:20.529
Everybody out except you two...
Wachter, Capetanos.

24:25.806 --> 24:30.072
George... is this
your conn locker?

24:36.983 --> 24:38.382
You don't mind?

24:41.721 --> 24:45.134
Well, we have a witness
that puts you and, uh, Big Karl

24:45.158 --> 24:47.403
at Tyler Hammond's house.

24:47.427 --> 24:50.640
You guys make a habit
of beating up civilians?

24:50.664 --> 24:51.974
What are you looking for, sir?

24:51.998 --> 24:52.975
Evidence.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.377
- Of what?
- The assault

24:54.401 --> 24:56.879
- on Petty Officer Burrows.
- That's crazy.

24:56.903 --> 24:58.247
Is it?

24:58.271 --> 25:00.950
'Cause every time I look at her,

25:00.974 --> 25:03.085
you guys are...

25:03.109 --> 25:04.454
all over her.

25:04.478 --> 25:06.689
You afraid
she's gonna say something?

25:06.713 --> 25:08.257
You got it wrong.

25:08.281 --> 25:11.027
What about the murder
of Special Agent Lara Macy?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.929
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is out of hand.
- Shut up.

25:12.953 --> 25:14.030
We don't know anything about...

25:14.054 --> 25:15.783
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

25:20.026 --> 25:22.371
Look, we jumped
that rich punk Hammond.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.340
We were at the bar
that night in Marseille.

25:24.364 --> 25:25.608
We saw them leave together.

25:25.632 --> 25:27.156
He raped Petty Officer Burrows.

25:29.169 --> 25:30.513
She's one of us.

25:30.537 --> 25:32.148
And we take care of our own.

25:32.172 --> 25:36.319
So you're confessing
to the fistfight

25:36.343 --> 25:38.955
but not the rape or the murder.

25:38.979 --> 25:40.674
And why should we believe you?

25:43.116 --> 25:45.380
Because it's the truth.

25:52.726 --> 25:54.504
Relax.

25:54.528 --> 25:56.189
Exhale.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.175
I'm trying, sir.

25:59.199 --> 26:02.396
Try harder,
and don't call me sir.

26:04.905 --> 26:08.584
Not forcing you
to do anything here.

26:08.608 --> 26:11.600
I know.

26:14.014 --> 26:15.758
I get the kind of pressure,

26:15.782 --> 26:17.422
the kind of scrutiny
you're under, Kaylen.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.085
Don't let whoever did this
get away with it.

26:26.192 --> 26:27.904
It's not just about you.

26:27.928 --> 26:29.225
It's about the truth.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.723
It's about a dead NCIS agent.

26:36.770 --> 26:39.015
It's about somebody getting away
with murder...

26:39.039 --> 26:41.837
until now.

26:50.750 --> 26:53.048
Special Agent Lara Macy.

26:57.958 --> 27:01.587
She died trying to arrest
whoever did this to you.

27:04.631 --> 27:07.710
That was her job.

27:07.734 --> 27:09.827
Now this is my job.

27:13.907 --> 27:16.552
So, who did it?

27:16.576 --> 27:18.387
Those two sailors
on the Majestic?

27:18.411 --> 27:20.038
No!

27:25.251 --> 27:27.087
It was the college kid...

27:29.155 --> 27:30.713
Tyler Hammond.

27:35.895 --> 27:38.090
But he wasn't alone.

27:42.002 --> 27:44.480
It's contaminated, Gibbs.

27:44.504 --> 27:46.115
Burrows' rape kit?

27:46.139 --> 27:48.551
Also known
as a Vitullo kit. Yeah.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.586
When Petty Officer Burrows
refused to allow its use,

27:50.610 --> 27:53.289
the hospital filed it away
in some storage closet.

27:53.313 --> 27:54.323
I mean, legally,

27:54.347 --> 27:55.825
they have to run
the test anyway,

27:55.849 --> 27:57.493
but by the time
they processed it,

27:57.517 --> 27:59.395
something happened.

27:59.419 --> 28:01.330
Abbs, you can't pull
anything from it?

28:01.354 --> 28:04.533
I'm really sorry, Gibbs,
but scientifically,

28:04.557 --> 28:06.602
you're no closer
to knowing who did this

28:06.626 --> 28:08.938
than you were when you started.

28:08.962 --> 28:10.373
Give me the results, anyway.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.974
I just told you they're useless.

28:11.998 --> 28:13.376
I know that.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.245
Well, I know that you know,
but I... I'm confused.

28:16.269 --> 28:17.780
Oh! I know.

28:17.804 --> 28:19.782
You're doing your Gibbs thing,

28:19.806 --> 28:21.183
to get a confession.

28:21.207 --> 28:22.652
- Hey, DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss.

28:22.676 --> 28:24.220
Get Tyler Hammond back in here.

28:24.244 --> 28:25.221
- I'm on it.
- Gibbs.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.490
Gibbs.

28:27.514 --> 28:32.294
Look, I know that
Special Agent Macy's murder

28:32.318 --> 28:35.898
is super important,
and I know that you guys have

28:35.922 --> 28:37.233
a long history together

28:37.257 --> 28:39.168
going back to when
you were a marine.

28:39.192 --> 28:41.370
And not a lot
of people know that, but Gibbs,

28:41.394 --> 28:43.639
we really need

28:43.663 --> 28:45.474
to talk about Mexico...

28:45.498 --> 28:46.976
Mexico... Mexico... Mexico...

28:47.000 --> 28:48.268
Daddy... Daddy...

28:50.036 --> 28:52.314
What'd you just say?

28:52.338 --> 28:56.104
I said we need
to talk about Mexico...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.203
Probie... Probie... Probie...

29:03.116 --> 29:06.028
Ah, boss,
Agent Macy's notebooks...

29:06.052 --> 29:09.598
chronologically, I have figured
out what we're missing.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.767
January '91
through February '92.

29:11.791 --> 29:15.137
Those are all dates when Macy
was an MP at Pendleton.

29:15.161 --> 29:17.959
Now, that's the same time
that you were at Pendleton.

29:21.401 --> 29:22.511
Boss, what's going on?

29:22.535 --> 29:24.113
Drawing of the guy
from Macy's house.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.037
I need an I.D., McGee, now.

29:32.378 --> 29:33.355
¿Bueno?

29:33.379 --> 29:34.356
Hello.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.959
Uh, ¿habla usted inglés?

29:36.983 --> 29:38.661
Sí. This is Camila. Who is this?

29:38.685 --> 29:39.895
Camila,

29:39.919 --> 29:42.198
this is Jethro Gibbs,
Mike Franks' friend.

29:42.222 --> 29:44.066
Señor Gibbs. ¿Como estas?

29:44.090 --> 29:47.269
Bien. Uh, I need you
to get a message to Mike for me.

29:47.293 --> 29:48.504
I have not seen him.

29:48.528 --> 29:50.639
But when he comes in,
I will make sure he...

29:50.663 --> 29:53.242
You need to get the message
to him now. Right now.

29:53.266 --> 29:54.677
Sí, señor. I will try.

29:54.701 --> 29:56.746
The message is "Rule number 44."

29:56.770 --> 29:58.481
Repeat it back to me.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.015
Rule 44.

30:00.039 --> 30:02.218
He will know what this means?

30:02.242 --> 30:03.385
Just give him the message.

30:03.409 --> 30:06.088
Make sure he has Leyla and Amira
with him.

30:06.112 --> 30:07.823
Just do that, okay?

30:07.847 --> 30:09.816
Señor Gibbs, are you all right?

30:14.087 --> 30:15.698
Kaylen Burrows had
a rape kit done

30:15.722 --> 30:17.133
the night of the attack.

30:17.157 --> 30:19.235
It's positive.
Your son's DNA's all over it.

30:19.259 --> 30:20.970
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

30:20.994 --> 30:22.325
There's no mistake.

30:24.731 --> 30:27.176
I know what's going on here,
Gibbs.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.145
This is the Navy covering
for its own.

30:29.169 --> 30:30.613
It's positive for you, too!

30:30.637 --> 30:34.517
You flew to France to meet
Tyler for a few days,

30:34.541 --> 30:36.519
spend some quality time
with your son.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.687
He didn't rape that girl alone.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.770
You both raped her, together!

30:42.982 --> 30:46.929
Who the hell
do you think you are?

30:46.953 --> 30:48.164
We're done here.

30:48.188 --> 30:51.123
Sit your asses down!

30:54.327 --> 30:56.272
I'd like to speak to my son.

30:56.296 --> 30:58.507
I'd like to speak to Lara Macy,
but she's dead!

30:58.531 --> 30:59.942
Did you kill her?

30:59.966 --> 31:03.636
Who the hell is
Lara freakin' Macy?

31:04.804 --> 31:07.602
Did you kill her?! Did you?!

31:10.076 --> 31:12.245
That Navy girl...

31:14.080 --> 31:16.192
she was drunk,
but she wanted it.

31:16.216 --> 31:19.879
But I swear
we didn't kill anybody!

31:24.090 --> 31:26.969
We didn't kill that agent.

31:26.993 --> 31:28.858
I'm sorry.

31:39.405 --> 31:42.017
Duck, the knife used
to kill Lara Macy...

31:42.041 --> 31:44.202
who made the knife?

31:45.544 --> 31:48.857
For the most part,
linking a specific weapon

31:48.881 --> 31:51.660
to a nick in a human bone is
virtually impossible.

31:51.684 --> 31:52.861
Okay, but?

31:52.885 --> 31:55.096
But in this case,

31:55.120 --> 31:58.500
I can go out on
the proverbial limb.

31:58.524 --> 32:01.002
The pattern is indicative of

32:01.026 --> 32:03.722
a KA-BAR 12-77.

32:04.730 --> 32:08.710
12-77. That's an Army knife.

32:08.734 --> 32:09.845
Yes. Our assailant knew

32:09.869 --> 32:12.747
that the first cut had
to be sufficient.

32:12.771 --> 32:15.350
He ended her life deliberately,

32:15.374 --> 32:16.785
brutally,
and without hesitation.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.020
She was executed.

32:19.044 --> 32:21.022
Yeah, and then left
to be discovered,

32:21.046 --> 32:23.592
to taunt whoever
would be hurt the most

32:23.616 --> 32:25.727
by her untimely death.

32:25.751 --> 32:29.464
Not unlike leaving
a single bullet to be found

32:29.488 --> 32:31.149
in the Mexican sun.

32:34.026 --> 32:38.326
You're familiar of the kind
of killer to which I speak.

32:44.637 --> 32:46.581
- I am.
- Now, Jethro...

32:46.605 --> 32:49.384
Wait. This is as much about you

32:49.408 --> 32:51.520
as it is about
Special Agent Macy.

32:51.544 --> 32:53.221
Listen to me.

32:53.245 --> 32:55.190
I autopsied Pedro Hernandez.

32:55.214 --> 32:56.925
The name seemed
familiar at the time.

32:56.949 --> 32:58.384
Now I know why.

32:59.251 --> 33:01.196
I know what you've been

33:01.220 --> 33:04.023
carrying around
for nearly 20 years.

33:05.524 --> 33:07.903
You may not have wanted this
to come to the surface,

33:07.927 --> 33:09.738
but someone else did.

33:09.762 --> 33:13.408
And now they are forcing
your hand.

33:13.432 --> 33:14.576
Who is it?

33:14.600 --> 33:16.678
I mean, tell me, Jethro!

33:16.702 --> 33:17.913
Jethro!

33:17.937 --> 33:19.648
Yeah. Gibbs.

33:19.672 --> 33:22.050
Señor, I am glad you answered.

33:22.074 --> 33:24.286
Camila, did Franks
get my message?

33:24.310 --> 33:26.588
Sí, señor,
but there are men here.

33:26.612 --> 33:28.790
Soldados. Soldiers with guns.

33:28.814 --> 33:30.592
Your amigo is in bad trouble.

33:30.616 --> 33:33.278
Señor Gibbs? Señor Gibbs?

33:37.489 --> 33:39.568
Where is he?

33:39.592 --> 33:41.169
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.704
The hell you don't.
Colonel Bell.

33:42.728 --> 33:44.172
Where is he?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.408
- I haven't spoken to him.
- Sure, you have.

33:46.432 --> 33:48.310
What are you doing
to me, Allison?

33:48.334 --> 33:50.612
I'm here to help
with the task force.

33:50.636 --> 33:52.113
This isn't about that.
This is about.

33:52.137 --> 33:54.482
Colonel Merton Bell
using you to get to me.

33:54.506 --> 33:56.751
I haven't told him
anything about you.

33:56.775 --> 33:59.220
You must have, 'cause
people around me are dying.

33:59.244 --> 34:00.622
People I care about.

34:00.646 --> 34:01.923
Bell is after me.

34:01.947 --> 34:03.758
Because you threw him
in a Mexican jail.

34:03.782 --> 34:04.759
He's a criminal.

34:04.783 --> 34:05.794
Is he?

34:05.818 --> 34:07.295
Is that for you to decide?

34:07.319 --> 34:09.030
I am his attorney, Mr. Gibbs.

34:09.054 --> 34:10.599
He's a patriot. It's my job

34:10.623 --> 34:12.955
- to defend him.
- He's a murderer!

34:15.127 --> 34:18.005
How's it feel to be in the
murder business, Ms. Hart?

34:18.030 --> 34:19.274
I don't like
what you're suggesting.

34:19.297 --> 34:20.742
Be honest with me!

34:20.766 --> 34:22.495
Just one time,
be honest with me.

34:26.804 --> 34:28.507
Where is he?

34:34.480 --> 34:37.891
Last I heard, he was headed
back down to Mexico.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.213
To Baja.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.053
What are you going to do?

34:45.024 --> 34:47.159
You're making
a dangerous mistake.

34:48.427 --> 34:51.039
Uh, Bell's corporate jet

34:51.063 --> 34:54.009
registered a flight plan
out of Virginia two days ago.

34:54.033 --> 34:56.478
Final destination was Mexico.

34:56.502 --> 34:58.713
They're after Mike Franks.

34:58.737 --> 35:01.383
Flight crew,

35:01.407 --> 35:03.551
Bell himself, and a couple
of his current employees.

35:03.575 --> 35:04.586
Names, backgrounds.

35:04.610 --> 35:07.789
Well, we've got one ex-con,
a few dishonorable discharges,

35:07.813 --> 35:09.891
all low-ranking,
except for this guy.

35:09.915 --> 35:13.043
Former Army Ranger
Jason Paul Dean.

35:14.453 --> 35:16.031
Army Ranger.

35:16.055 --> 35:17.165
The guy was highly decorated

35:17.189 --> 35:18.500
until he killed a bunch
of Afghan civilians

35:18.524 --> 35:19.868
and got discharged,

35:19.892 --> 35:23.571
after which he was hired
by none other than Merton Bell.

35:23.595 --> 35:25.240
Two peas in a bulletproof pod.

35:25.264 --> 35:27.242
Oh, and boss,
I think we've got a match

35:27.266 --> 35:29.778
on who stole
Agent Macy's notebooks.

35:29.802 --> 35:32.180
Last call Macy got was
from a disposable cell.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.782
Abby find out
where that came from?

35:33.806 --> 35:35.550
Uh, still working on it.

35:35.574 --> 35:38.853
DiNozzo, info on Bell
after he landed in Mexico.

35:38.877 --> 35:41.289
Um, well, anything specific
you want me?

35:41.313 --> 35:43.838
Everything. I want everything.

35:46.719 --> 35:48.863
Gibbs, come and look at this.

35:48.887 --> 35:49.864
Talk to me, Abbs.

35:49.888 --> 35:51.499
The disposable cell phone

35:51.523 --> 35:53.601
that was used to call
Agent Macy...

35:53.625 --> 35:56.771
finally tracked it to
a convenience store in Norfolk.

35:56.795 --> 35:58.740
I'm processing
the security camera footage

35:58.764 --> 36:00.308
to find out who bought it.

36:00.332 --> 36:04.279
But it's...
it's gonna take a while.

36:04.303 --> 36:06.314
You know, if you want
to just relax.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.749
Relax?

36:07.773 --> 36:09.240
Abbs.

36:17.516 --> 36:18.927
This is a lockdown.

36:18.951 --> 36:19.994
A what?

36:20.018 --> 36:21.996
We're going to talk, Gibbs.

36:22.020 --> 36:23.398
Like hell. Not now.

36:23.422 --> 36:25.652
Yes! Now!

36:27.459 --> 36:29.771
Since when did I become
the kid in class

36:29.795 --> 36:33.141
that the teacher won't call on?

36:33.165 --> 36:34.943
The evidence in my report

36:34.967 --> 36:38.425
says that you killed
Pedro Hernandez.

36:40.105 --> 36:42.517
And you're not even willing
to talk to me about it.

36:42.541 --> 36:44.509
I didn't think I needed to.

36:46.245 --> 36:49.090
I owe you everything.

36:49.114 --> 36:50.449
You're Gibbs.

36:52.017 --> 36:54.963
No one needs to know the truth

36:54.987 --> 36:58.233
about the Hernandez
investigation.

36:58.257 --> 37:01.970
I am willing to do
anything for you.

37:01.994 --> 37:05.640
I just need you
to tell me what to do.

37:05.664 --> 37:07.809
No, you don't, Abbs.

37:07.833 --> 37:11.112
I've only ever needed you
to do one thing.

37:11.136 --> 37:13.536
My job.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.252
But it's different this time.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.853
I mean, it has to be, right?

37:18.877 --> 37:21.471
No, it doesn't.

37:32.257 --> 37:35.503
Former Army Ranger Jason Dean.

37:35.527 --> 37:37.739
Hell...

37:37.763 --> 37:39.707
He's one of Bell's men.

37:39.731 --> 37:43.511
I bet his knife matches
Agent Macy's wound.

37:43.535 --> 37:45.127
You know too much, Abby.

37:48.974 --> 37:50.852
Gibbs...

37:50.876 --> 37:53.655
What do I do?

37:53.679 --> 37:56.910
You send in the report
to the task force.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.829
All of it.

38:00.853 --> 38:03.832
I know.

38:03.856 --> 38:06.825
You shouldn't have
to tell me, right?

38:22.107 --> 38:23.218
Where's Gibbs?

38:23.242 --> 38:24.452
Security said he ran out

38:24.476 --> 38:26.421
of this place
like it was on fire.

38:26.445 --> 38:29.290
Excuse me, sir,
but why am I here, exactly?

38:29.314 --> 38:33.027
'Cause based on
what I'm hearing,

38:33.051 --> 38:35.463
Special Agent Macy's killer
worked for Colonel Bell...

38:35.487 --> 38:37.699
your client.

38:37.723 --> 38:40.702
This is Lieutenant
Jason Paul Dean.

38:40.726 --> 38:42.136
That was Bell's right-hand man.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.038
I don't represent Mr. Dean.

38:44.062 --> 38:47.075
But you represent Bell's firm...
First Defense PMC.

38:47.099 --> 38:49.310
Dean is employed
by First Defense.

38:49.334 --> 38:52.513
Which means you're in
the hot seat, M. Allison Hart.

38:52.537 --> 38:54.061
I'll find Gibbs.

38:59.378 --> 39:00.922
Before you say anything...

39:00.946 --> 39:03.992
Before you try to explain to me
why I don't have the legal right

39:04.016 --> 39:06.895
to question you, let me
assure you, I looked into it.

39:06.919 --> 39:08.147
I do.

39:09.388 --> 39:12.333
This is a possible matter
of national security,

39:12.357 --> 39:14.569
thanks to Bell crossing
federal borders

39:14.593 --> 39:15.970
and working
with narco-terrorists.

39:15.994 --> 39:19.641
Which gives me a whole lot
of wiggle room.

39:19.665 --> 39:22.176
Do I need a lawyer?

39:22.200 --> 39:24.225
You need to listen.

39:25.938 --> 39:27.132
Okay.

39:28.874 --> 39:32.120
I got a lot of pieces
to a puzzle here.

39:32.144 --> 39:34.188
And the only thing these pieces
have in common

39:34.212 --> 39:35.590
are Colonel Bell
and First Defense.

39:35.614 --> 39:37.659
So let's cut to the chase.

39:37.683 --> 39:39.116
What the hell's going on?

39:46.591 --> 39:48.603
Do you care about Gibbs?

39:48.627 --> 39:50.638
What kind of a question is that?

39:50.662 --> 39:53.041
Stop being a lawyer,
start being a friend.

39:53.065 --> 39:56.660
Do you care about what happens
to Special Agent Gibbs?

39:58.337 --> 39:59.781
Yes.

39:59.805 --> 40:02.706
Then tell me
what your patriot Bell is up to.

40:05.477 --> 40:08.022
Ever since Colonel Bell
got out of prison,

40:08.046 --> 40:10.525
he's been accumulating
information

40:10.549 --> 40:12.760
on Special Agent Gibbs.

40:12.784 --> 40:15.763
To what end? Revenge?

40:15.787 --> 40:18.153
Blackmail? Leverage?

41:52.384 --> 41:54.784
Mike.

42:01.626 --> 42:04.459
Don't even think about it.

42:06.865 --> 42:08.142
You're Dean?

42:08.166 --> 42:11.795
Welcome to Mexico, Agent Gibbs.

42:14.840 --> 42:18.686
First Macy,
then you kill Franks?

42:18.710 --> 42:21.222
That ain't Franks.

42:21.246 --> 42:23.146
Who is it?

42:24.783 --> 42:27.013
Colonel Merton Bell.

42:28.787 --> 42:31.089
Who do you really work for?
