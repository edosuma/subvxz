00:04.180 --> 00:05.580
Akatsuki...

00:10.930 --> 00:12.990
<i>Where am I?</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:16.310
<i>Where am I going?</i>

01:49.310 --> 01:51.620
Come one, come all!

01:51.620 --> 01:54.120
If you don't buy one today, your Christmas cake...

01:55.360 --> 01:58.390
How about that? It turned into a plain old cake!

01:58.660 --> 02:00.150
It's hip with today's youth!

02:00.150 --> 02:02.640
If you buy one now, it comes with a reindeer mask!

02:02.640 --> 02:04.770
You there! Yes, you, beautiful!

02:09.530 --> 02:11.770
Damned adventurers...

02:12.170 --> 02:17.780
<b>A Lost Child at Dawn</b>

02:14.060 --> 02:15.670
A Lost Child at Dawn.

02:19.810 --> 02:21.280
There's no need to worry.

02:22.230 --> 02:26.670
When Akatsuki wakes up, 
Henrietta will contact us.

02:26.670 --> 02:27.290
Yes...

02:28.490 --> 02:30.040
Aren't you cold?

02:30.570 --> 02:32.760
You've been standing by the window for a while.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.050
You're right...

02:37.650 --> 02:42.180
Compared to where I used to live, it's cold here.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.930
You weren't born in Akihabara?

02:45.930 --> 02:46.690
No.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.620
I was born in a town called Kiyose.

02:49.030 --> 02:52.150
In this world, it would be around Nobidome District.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.610
You're not a noble, Rieze?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.740
No, I'm not.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.160
I was born in a small, normal home.

03:04.090 --> 03:07.240
I don't know anything, do I?

03:08.080 --> 03:09.770
About you...

03:10.100 --> 03:13.930
No, about Akatsuki or Henrietta, either.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.670
Or Marielle.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.270
And...

03:17.690 --> 03:18.670
And...

03:19.590 --> 03:20.520
<i>No.</i>

03:20.920 --> 03:22.550
<i>It's not that I didn't know.</i>

03:22.970 --> 03:24.670
<i>It's that I never tried to know.</i>

03:25.300 --> 03:27.270
<i>Not even about Crusty...</i>

03:29.860 --> 03:32.030
It's especially cold today.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.190
In school, I was a good student.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.700
The teachers loved me, 
and I was adept at my studies.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.470
When I showed how clever I was, 
everyone praised me.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.980
I became skilled at it.

03:49.850 --> 03:51.370
In that sense,

03:51.810 --> 03:55.250
I'm glad I joined D.D.D. when I came here.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.990
I met a lot of people,

03:57.990 --> 04:03.470
and I was forced to realize that the only 
world I had ever tried to see was so small.

04:04.190 --> 04:11.000
If I hadn't, I may have gone on like that forever, 
with something very important missing.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.480
I was really on a bad path.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.980
Yes.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.570
What's most important is always there, somewhere.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.470
And because it's important,

04:23.160 --> 04:25.740
I think you need to treasure it.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.490
That's why I think I need...

04:29.990 --> 04:32.100
well, to be a princess.

04:32.510 --> 04:35.500
But I'm never good enough.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.310
So...

04:38.130 --> 04:41.990
So I want to treat you properly, Rieze!

04:42.350 --> 04:46.010
Otherwise, I won't have the right 
to be treated kindly by you,

04:46.700 --> 04:50.020
or to delude myself into thinking I'm protecting you.

04:51.510 --> 04:53.770
Treat me properly?

04:54.060 --> 04:55.480
Very well.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.750
Then here's my first bit of advice.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.290
To treat someone "properly" is too difficult.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.860
Let's be friends, Lenessia.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.520
I'm an adventurer, but if you don't mind that...

05:24.180 --> 05:26.510
<i>No... This couldn't be...</i>

05:48.270 --> 05:50.690
<i>Where am I heading?</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:56.830
<i>Being pushed, rushed, driven along...</i>

06:11.230 --> 06:13.330
<i>Where am I trying to go?</i>

06:25.090 --> 06:28.200
<i>I may not have a destination.</i>

06:28.990 --> 06:32.560
<i>I'm just trying to run.</i>

08:32.320 --> 08:35.210
I didn't think it would be so quiet here.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.830
Yeah.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.070
Something disappeared...

08:48.990 --> 08:51.250
Did you also feel it, my lord?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.890
Akatsuki...

09:18.610 --> 09:19.850
<i>I see.</i>

09:21.580 --> 09:22.660
Amazing, isn't it?

09:23.530 --> 09:26.470
It isn't snow, is it?

09:27.130 --> 09:27.750
No.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.170
Everyone's thoughts...

09:30.170 --> 09:32.270
The memory fragments they offered up,

09:32.790 --> 09:34.760
so they could rise up once more.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.720
You were defeated, Akatsuki?

09:42.640 --> 09:43.600
<i>That's right.</i>

09:44.060 --> 09:45.710
<i>I died.</i>

09:48.810 --> 09:52.360
I had almost figured something out...

09:53.650 --> 09:54.570
I see.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.520
So was I.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.110
I died.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.630
You, too, my lord?

10:00.190 --> 10:01.110
Yeah.

10:03.010 --> 10:07.230
It's been a heck of a Christmas Eve, my lord.

10:17.110 --> 10:18.480
I failed.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.850
I was naÃ¯ve.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.650
I couldn't trust them enough.

10:22.980 --> 10:25.030
I don't understand.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.600
It isn't that I'm upset because I couldn't win.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.290
You didn't do the best you could.

10:31.810 --> 10:34.110
You didn't do what you needed to do.

10:35.310 --> 10:36.490
It's strange.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.780
I didn't think I'd see you here.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.610
Yeah, my lord.

10:41.610 --> 10:42.370
It is strange.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.200
<i>Is it only a coincidence?</i>

10:45.800 --> 10:50.060
<i>No, I'm sure it's because I wanted to see my lord.</i>

10:50.710 --> 10:53.300
<i>I wanted him to pat me on the head.</i>

10:54.250 --> 10:58.190
<i>Maybe I can find that which I almost found,</i>

10:58.190 --> 11:00.640
<i>if I search for it myself.</i>

11:01.540 --> 11:04.740
I'm going to try again.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.500
I will, too, I guess.

11:07.930 --> 11:09.390
Everyone taught me.

11:10.730 --> 11:11.780
My lord...

11:44.100 --> 11:48.310
I passed through some quiet place...

11:54.370 --> 11:56.300
<i>It's gone.</i>

11:57.070 --> 11:58.150
<i>But...</i>

11:58.610 --> 12:00.580
<i>I feel like I found something,</i>

12:00.580 --> 12:01.970
<i>like I understand something.</i>

12:02.570 --> 12:05.410
<i>So there's something I should do...</i>

12:05.410 --> 12:07.660
<i>Something I must do.</i>

12:11.630 --> 12:13.630
Akatsuki!

12:15.160 --> 12:16.380
Are you okay?

12:16.380 --> 12:18.070
You don't have any scars, do you?

12:17.650 --> 12:18.800
S-Stop...

12:18.070 --> 12:20.970
You're so cute!

12:20.970 --> 12:24.470
I thought it was about time for you to wake up.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.030
Um...

12:28.380 --> 12:30.660
I know this isn't an appropriate request,

12:30.660 --> 12:32.480
but I'd like you all to help me.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.140
Would you share your Teachings with me?

12:35.530 --> 12:38.230
I want to capture that murderer.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.170
Nazuna, didn't Soujirou use the Teachings?

12:43.170 --> 12:43.990
Yeah.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.790
But it wasn't enough.

12:46.790 --> 12:48.000
Yep.

12:49.090 --> 12:51.810
Why do you seek them, despite that?

12:51.810 --> 12:53.100
Because...

12:53.460 --> 12:56.540
I want to end the murders!

12:56.540 --> 12:59.490
And not just your Teachings, but... well...

13:00.190 --> 13:03.760
If there's a way to stop him, 
please tell me anything you know!

13:05.620 --> 13:07.860
You think you can beat him?

13:07.860 --> 13:09.050
I don't know,

13:09.420 --> 13:12.490
but I have to do something to end it.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.940
With my lord gone, someone has to do it.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.520
What do you mean?

13:17.810 --> 13:19.350
Shiroe isn't here?

13:20.650 --> 13:23.030
We were asked to keep it a secret,

13:23.480 --> 13:25.370
but that's right.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.910
At the moment, Shiro is away from Akihabara.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.340
Now I get it.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.400
No wonder you're so desperate.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.040
Well?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.930
I haven't heard your answer.

13:37.930 --> 13:39.910
Do you think you can beat him?

13:39.910 --> 13:42.330
Do you think you can end this?

13:43.460 --> 13:46.180
Can you do it alone?

13:47.170 --> 13:48.370
I can't.

13:49.050 --> 13:51.370
I can't do it alone.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.180
That's why I want your help.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.690
Please help me!

14:01.830 --> 14:05.200
You half-passed, I would say.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.200
There are eight Teachings 
that D.D.D. is aware of.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.200
I've already gained my lord's permission.

14:13.570 --> 14:15.480
He's told me to share them with you.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.210
Really...

14:19.710 --> 14:23.480
To come all this way, just to start 
over as a middle schooler...

14:32.200 --> 14:35.580
Doesn't seem there are any more 
goblins over here, either.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.230
Yeah.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.230
My lord...

14:39.550 --> 14:41.220
Are you bored?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.580
You got me.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.740
I am, yes.

14:45.740 --> 14:47.300
Deal with it.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.740
I've dealt with it all this time, and I'm still bored.

14:53.770 --> 14:55.030
What's wrong?

14:55.030 --> 14:57.910
Lately, my weapon's been acting strangely.

14:57.910 --> 14:59.860
Why not send it to be repaired?

14:59.860 --> 15:00.710
Yeah...

15:01.000 --> 15:04.500
But it's not any less powerful, 
so I've just overlooked it.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.710
Its name is "Disaster," right?

15:07.710 --> 15:12.010
Yeah. Its flavor text is pretty dark, as well.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.890
It seems to be fine.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.520
Sorry to bother you.

15:23.150 --> 15:26.280
<b><i>Onigiri Shop Enmusubi</i></b>

15:27.250 --> 15:28.970
What a relief!

15:28.970 --> 15:32.280
Research announcements are always tense, 
no matter how often you do them.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.900
But it looks like everyone was surprised.

15:35.340 --> 15:40.350
For one of Roderic Research's recent 
announcements, it had a lot of impact.

15:41.470 --> 15:45.800
That now everyone can cook, 
even if their sub-class isn't chef.

15:46.350 --> 15:49.800
It's limited to simple stuff like salad...

15:50.110 --> 15:53.590
But why is a change like this happening?

15:55.150 --> 15:56.320
Guild master?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.850
Oh, you can keep eating.

15:58.850 --> 16:02.730
Our investigation's interim reports are in, 
so I'll just briefly interrupt.

16:02.730 --> 16:09.730
<b>Personality 

Woman             Man</b>

16:02.730 --> 16:09.730
<b>Voice 

Sex Differences</b>

16:03.760 --> 16:06.820
There are three things I need to announce.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.740
First, regarding sex differences between 
now and when this was a game.

16:10.140 --> 16:11.270
Sex differences?

16:11.270 --> 16:14.500
Some people play a different sex 
than they are in real life, right?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.740
He's talking about that.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.200
RDR has reported in the past

16:18.200 --> 16:22.450
that personality is influenced by a person's body.

16:22.450 --> 16:25.000
But it appears the voice is affected, as well.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.980
An adventurer with a female 
body will find their voice

16:28.980 --> 16:31.580
gradually becoming feminine,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.690
even if the player is actually a man.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.360
Next is optical observation.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.750
There's still a lot we don't know,

16:43.750 --> 16:47.530
but it seems the distance between 
Akihabara and Mt. Fuji is increasing.

16:47.950 --> 16:50.690
Actually, the distance between any two points

16:50.690 --> 16:53.030
is increasing by a small amount.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.610
Excuse me.

16:54.610 --> 16:55.510
Go ahead.

16:56.030 --> 16:58.480
Is that occurring everywhere?

16:58.850 --> 17:02.780
Does that mean Yamato is getting bigger?

17:03.110 --> 17:04.790
We believe so.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.830
Lastly, regarding flavor text...

17:09.280 --> 17:11.730
As you know, flavor text is merely

17:11.360 --> 17:15.180
<b>Healing Potion (Basic)</b>

17:11.360 --> 17:15.180
<b>Effect/ Healing Potion (Basic) 
Restores a small amount of HP</b>

17:11.730 --> 17:16.510
an explanation that describes where 
an item originated or what it is.

17:15.180 --> 17:18.300
<b>Explanation/ Healing Potion (Basic) 
A magical medicine created by adventurers. 
Its capabilities, flavor, and scent change 
depending on the skill of the creator.</b>

17:16.510 --> 17:18.300
As the name suggests, it's just for flavor.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.850
It has no in-game effects.

17:20.850 --> 17:22.020
Yeah,

17:22.020 --> 17:25.000
it's just to add atmosphere...

17:25.000 --> 17:25.810
Yes.

17:26.030 --> 17:28.730
It should have no meaning at all.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.570
But we've confirmed

17:32.320 --> 17:36.200
that some items' flavor texts are 
having real-world effects.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.530
No way.

17:37.910 --> 17:42.040
Could so many coincidences really occur at once?

17:42.040 --> 17:47.530
Shouldn't we assume that this world 
is undergoing some large-scale change?

17:47.530 --> 17:50.860
The Apocalypse is not over yet.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.020
I've already heard the broader details.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.470
The murderer is a Person of the Land.

17:59.450 --> 18:00.970
<i>You told them.</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:03.540
If this gets out,

18:03.540 --> 18:07.200
relations between adventurers and 
People of the Land will worsen in Akihabara.

18:07.590 --> 18:11.730
Akatsuki tried to resolve the situation 
because she was concerned about that.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.120
Right?

18:14.840 --> 18:16.950
I can understand that.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.990
Though I can't imagine you'll be 
able to hide it completely.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.430
Not with all these victims...

18:23.430 --> 18:26.250
Is the West Wind Brigade going public with this?

18:26.570 --> 18:27.980
No.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.400
Souji said he's pulling out.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.160
Though that's up to you two.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.290
That's...

18:34.290 --> 18:38.510
Stop wasting time confirming things, 
and get on with the lecture.

18:40.430 --> 18:42.470
Is this what you mean?

18:42.860 --> 18:46.270
You two were vain enough to think 
you could deal with this yourselves.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.270
You knew you should have spoken to us, didn't you?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.770
Aren't you being a little arrogant?

18:53.220 --> 18:55.280
Aren't you insulting the people around you?

18:55.770 --> 18:58.280
How long do you intend to remain alone?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.530
Don't you think it's childish to tell yourself

19:01.120 --> 19:03.170
that all you need is Shiroe?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.540
<i>True, it's always been that way.</i>

19:06.450 --> 19:09.620
<i>I was content with how 
comfortable I felt in his shadow.</i>

19:09.620 --> 19:12.880
<i>I never tried to get close to anyone else.</i>

19:12.880 --> 19:14.710
<i>Because I was totally reliant on him...</i>

19:15.640 --> 19:19.050
<i>When he left, I suddenly couldn't do anything.</i>

19:19.830 --> 19:22.050
<i>Not even what he asked me to do.</i>

19:22.470 --> 19:26.420
Did you think you've been 
coming here to protect her?

19:27.350 --> 19:29.820
You weren't the only one

19:29.820 --> 19:32.810
who had the job of visiting Watermaple House.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.890
I was, as well, and so was Rieze.

19:36.420 --> 19:39.490
<i>I'm not the only one my lord relied on.</i>

19:39.490 --> 19:40.820
<i>Of course.</i>

19:41.280 --> 19:42.320
<i>But...</i>

19:43.030 --> 19:48.070
<i>It's true that I wanted to help her 
because she was trying so hard.</i>

19:48.540 --> 19:49.330
<i>So...</i>

19:50.240 --> 19:51.580
I want your help.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.590
I need your help.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.600
Yes, of course.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.100
Rieze and I will help you.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.590
But who should you be saying that to?

20:00.590 --> 20:02.060
Who...

20:06.250 --> 20:07.470
Akatsuki...

20:08.550 --> 20:10.600
Akatsuki is my friend!

20:17.070 --> 20:18.990
Lenessia is doing her best,

20:18.990 --> 20:21.110
so I want to help her!

20:21.110 --> 20:22.340
I want you all...

20:23.210 --> 20:25.750
all of us... to help her.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.670
Because we're friends.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.320
Very well.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.500
Let's stop that murderer.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.010
I'll come up with a plan.

20:39.010 --> 20:41.990
I'm a friend, too, after all.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.430
My lord, the sun has set.

20:47.430 --> 20:48.470
Let's hurry.

20:49.190 --> 20:51.530
A broken spearhead...

20:51.530 --> 20:53.100
What's the matter?

20:54.050 --> 20:56.790
It looks like this is a training area.

20:56.790 --> 20:57.900
For goblins.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.820
Goblins?

20:58.820 --> 21:03.320
Surely not. I've never heard of them training.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.450
I'm sorry... It's acting strangely again.

21:14.470 --> 21:15.580
Sansa!

21:23.520 --> 21:24.430
My lord!

21:29.160 --> 21:30.350
My lord!

21:44.860 --> 21:45.950
My lord?

21:47.220 --> 21:48.840
The Graupel Sword Byakumaru?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.700
That's the katana the samurai had?

21:52.220 --> 21:54.050
I knew it on sight.

21:54.050 --> 21:56.980
I saw it many times at Amenoma.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.420
Marie, is something wrong?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.460
W-Well, just...

22:01.460 --> 22:04.970
It's about time, and I haven't gotten a call.

22:05.290 --> 22:09.810
Shiroe and Naotsugu aren't playing around.

22:09.810 --> 22:12.860
They won't always have time.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.480
Yeah, I know, but...

22:15.400 --> 22:18.480
<i>Today, something just doesn't feel right.</i>

22:18.990 --> 22:21.750
Did you notice anything else about the murderer?

22:22.450 --> 22:23.490
One second.

22:23.850 --> 22:24.790
Yes?

22:25.950 --> 22:26.990
Yes.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.500
What?

22:30.080 --> 22:31.420
That can't be...

24:05.490 --> 24:09.090
The murderer's mind is taken from him 
as he becomes a true monster.

24:09.090 --> 24:12.640
Is he remembering a legendary hero?

24:12.640 --> 24:15.420
Rieze and Henrietta begin preparations for a raid.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.390
Akatsuki attempts to master the Teachings.

24:17.390 --> 24:20.940
At some point, they find themselves 
with many friends.

24:20.940 --> 24:23.400
Twenty-six, in all.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.710
Next time: The Maidens of Watermaple.

24:23.400 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Maidens of Watermaple</b>

24:25.710 --> 24:27.700
Rise up once more.
