00:05.373 --> 00:07.506
Hey, <i> voltage </i> fans,
it's liv rooney.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.540
And josh wilcox.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.843
And we are coming to you
live on gab-a-scope

00:10.845 --> 00:12.378
Talking to the fans
of <i> voltage,</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.313
Which will air
right after this q&a.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.348
And I'm willow.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.784
I love <i> voltage</i> !

00:21.222 --> 00:23.789
Let's get to those questions.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.357
Uh, first up, mandy says,
"liv, you look so beautiful."

00:26.360 --> 00:29.328
Oh! Thank you, mandy.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.698
Um, okay, so the next
question is for josh,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.400
And it's coming from gracie.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.870
She says,
"josh, what is your favorite
thing about playing garrison?"

00:37.872 --> 00:40.706
I guess that people
underestimate garrison,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.674
Which means that
he can surprise you.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.878
And also, on stage,
there are free waffles!

00:45.880 --> 00:48.147
(chuckles, sighs)

00:48.149 --> 00:51.216
Uh, liv, sofia says,
"show us your shoes!"

00:51.218 --> 00:54.186
Oops, caught me, sof-sof.
I'm not wearing shoes.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.754
Just my fuzzies.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.758
Okay, one last question for liv.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.226
Uh, "liv, I love your hair,"

01:01.228 --> 01:03.562
"liv, you're so pretty,"

01:03.564 --> 01:06.098
"liv, what are you wearing
on the red carpet this week
for the <i> fan pick awards</i> ?"

01:06.100 --> 01:07.566
Hmm. Well, here's a hint.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.601
I'm gonna be ditching
my fuzzy slippers.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.939
Thank you guys so much
and keep watching <i> voltage</i> !

01:13.941 --> 01:15.307
Bye!

01:16.710 --> 01:17.843
(squeals)

01:17.845 --> 01:20.179
I love talking
to the fans.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.748
Did you notice that
josh got asked about the show

01:22.750 --> 01:25.350
And all you got was
stuff about your looks?

01:25.352 --> 01:27.119
Yeah.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.954
I guess you're right.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.389
Although now that
I think about it,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.957
That kinda happens
all the time.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.525
Doesn't that bug you?

01:34.929 --> 01:36.061
That is weird.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.297
But I'm glad no one asked
me about my shoes.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.531

02:41.128 --> 02:43.529
You and me have a problem.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.631
You have an
overdue library book.

02:45.633 --> 02:49.501
What are you, like,
the library cop? (laughs)

02:49.503 --> 02:50.702
(laughs)

02:50.704 --> 02:51.803
(laughs)

02:51.805 --> 02:54.072
As a matter of fact,
I am the library cop.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.044
Three years ago,
you checked out

02:59.046 --> 03:01.380
<i>Dribble queen:</i>
<i>The holly bell story.</i>

03:01.382 --> 03:04.016
Oh, yeah, I love that book,
but I...

03:04.018 --> 03:05.417
(imitates dump truck)
returned it.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.619
Incorrect.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.225
And it is out of print,
thus rendering a new copy
impossible to procure,

03:13.227 --> 03:16.862
So either return the book
or face repercussions.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.397
Hmm.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.732
Wow. I think...

03:20.734 --> 03:22.801
Yeah, I think I can live

03:22.803 --> 03:25.704
With a black mark
on my library return record.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.372
Mm-hmm.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.874
Then prepare to be repercussed.

03:31.245 --> 03:34.580
Hey! Good morning,
mr. Dump truck sir.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.881
Allow me to return

03:35.883 --> 03:38.217
<i>Wizards: Don't call it</i>
<i>a dunce cap.</i>

03:39.853 --> 03:41.753
Whoa, hey, yo.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.422
This spine is sticky.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.257
What is this? Syrup?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.562
Well... (chuckles)
there may or may not

03:50.564 --> 03:52.598
Have been pancakes
in my backpack.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.665
There were.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.269
Damage like this
is gonna cost you.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.403
What?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.504
No! Come on!

03:59.506 --> 04:01.406
I'm saving up for tap shoes!

04:03.110 --> 04:06.612
Perhaps I can do you a favor
and look the other way.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.213
-(sigh of relief)
-of course...

04:08.215 --> 04:10.549
I will expect you
to return this favor

04:10.551 --> 04:12.050
When called upon.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.553
Well, don't see how
a deal like that

04:14.555 --> 04:17.256
With an upstanding guy
like you could backfire.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.357
Let's shake on it, buddy!

04:19.526 --> 04:20.759
That hand syrup-free?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.428
I cannot guarantee that.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.997
I'm gonna pass.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.973
Honey, when you're
at the <i> fan pick awards</i> ,

04:34.975 --> 04:37.743
Just make a subtle gesture
so I know you're thinking of me.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.177
Something like a...

04:43.617 --> 04:44.549
Now come on.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.551
Let's get you on that plane.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.553
Ooh, the red carpet awaits.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.055
You must be so excited.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.556
I am. I just...

04:51.558 --> 04:53.992
Something's really been
bugging me lately.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.427
Oh. What's the matter, honey?

04:55.429 --> 04:57.262
I just-- I don't know.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.598
I've been thinking
how when I do these things,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.467
You know, I get questions
mostly about my appearance,

05:02.469 --> 05:06.471
And male actors get questions
about their work.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.675
Oh. Yeah, that does seem
to be the way it is.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.678
Yeah. And I love
fashion obviously,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.280
But I also love my work,
and I just kind of wish

05:15.282 --> 05:17.015
That people would ask me
about that.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.951
If you want to
change the questions,

05:19.953 --> 05:23.121
You have to find a way
to change conversation.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.357
Wow.
(laughs)

05:25.359 --> 05:27.092
Change the convo.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.760
-Thanks.
-(chuckles)

05:28.762 --> 05:30.429
You just dropped a mom bomb.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.596
-Whoop!
-(laughs)

05:35.302 --> 05:36.868
(computer beeps)

05:36.870 --> 05:38.003
Hey!

05:38.005 --> 05:40.872
Okay, mom, so I need
my transcripts to apply

05:40.874 --> 05:42.607
For basketball
scholarships, right?

05:42.609 --> 05:45.477
But the ridgewood student portal
will not release them,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.112
And I'm gonna miss my deadline.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.347
Can you fix it?

05:48.349 --> 05:50.148
Well, lucky for you,

05:50.150 --> 05:52.517
Vice principal mom
has security clearance.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.520
So let's see.
Put in my code...

05:55.522 --> 05:56.955
-(computer beeps)
-oh!

05:56.957 --> 05:58.223
Yep, here's the problem.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.692
Your transcripts are being held
because a book called

06:00.694 --> 06:02.494
<i>Dribble queen </i> is overdue.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.329
<i>Dribble queen?</i>

06:04.331 --> 06:05.764
I'm being repercussed.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.168
Wait, momma. I have literally
no idea where this book is

06:10.170 --> 06:11.703
And now it's gonna
keep me out of college?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.506
Oh...

06:14.508 --> 06:16.641
Could you do
something about it...

06:16.643 --> 06:18.410
Vice principal mom?

06:18.412 --> 06:19.544
Winkity, wink, wink, wink, wink.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.012
-Oh.
-Huh?

06:21.014 --> 06:23.648
Madison rooney,
I am a vice principal,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.183
Not a common criminal.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.818
Rules are rules.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.687
No go on the winkity,
wink, wink?

06:28.689 --> 06:31.923
What about the...
The blinkity, blink, blink?

06:31.925 --> 06:34.092
Okay.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.395
Find the bookity,
book, book, book.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.368
Hey!

06:43.370 --> 06:45.170
It's my new pal, dump truck.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.238
(laughs)

06:46.240 --> 06:48.173
Let me just ditch
my books in my locker,

06:48.175 --> 06:51.076
Then we can hit the cafeteria
for some bro-rritos.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.111
Okay.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.581
Remember when I told you
one day I'd need a favor?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.417
Well, today is that day.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.188
I'm storing certain items
in your locker.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.756
What sort of...

07:04.758 --> 07:06.024
(imitates dump truck)
certain items?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.161
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.230
Please refrain from

07:12.232 --> 07:14.132
Opening your locker
until further notice.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.901
Now scram, yous.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.335
Oh!

07:19.239 --> 07:21.106
Why are you carrying
so many books?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.642
Joey, you know I worry
about your back.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.079
Dump truck's using
my locker for something.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.449
Uncle martucci...

07:30.451 --> 07:33.251
We ain't gonna be hearing
from tony slim nose no more.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.288
-I made sure of that
with my meat cleaver.
-(both gasp)

07:37.791 --> 07:40.058
And the pieces are stored
in a secure location.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.128
(gasps)

07:44.832 --> 07:46.631
Did you hear that?

07:46.633 --> 07:47.799
No!

07:49.269 --> 07:51.803
There was too much whimpering
and fear going on in my head.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.907
He's hiding a dead body
in your locker!

07:55.909 --> 07:59.277
Oh. Well, now the whimpering
and fear is coming out!

07:59.279 --> 08:00.846
(whimpers)

08:07.688 --> 08:09.788
Ugh! Where is it?!

08:09.790 --> 08:11.690
Where is that book?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.062
Yeah!

08:19.666 --> 08:20.832
Yeah!

08:22.669 --> 08:25.670
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.805
What are you doing right now?

08:26.807 --> 08:30.275
I... I thought we were
messing up the kitchen.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.579
It seemed like fun.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.984
No. I'm-- I'm looking
for this book (scoffs)

08:38.986 --> 08:41.286
And if I don't find it,

08:41.288 --> 08:43.522
Basically my entire
life is ruined.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.856
What book?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.192
Uh, <i> dribble queen:</i>
<i>The holly bell story.</i>

08:47.194 --> 08:48.460
(gasps)

08:50.898 --> 08:52.564
-Why did you just gasp?
-I didn't gasp.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.666
Yeah, you did.
You went... (gasps)

08:54.668 --> 08:56.902
Oh. That?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.236
I always do that.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.538
Tell me what you had
for breakfast.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.873
-Oatmeal.
-(gasps)

09:01.875 --> 09:03.241
(breathlessly)
see?

09:06.179 --> 09:07.846
Tell me what you know,

09:07.848 --> 09:10.015
Because if I don't
find that book,

09:10.017 --> 09:13.351
I'm not gonna go to college,
and then you are gonna

09:13.353 --> 09:16.755
Have to share a room
with joey... Forever.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.856
Okay! I know where the book is!

09:17.858 --> 09:20.392
Yes! Where is it?

09:23.497 --> 09:25.230
Down below.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.502
It's in the parker tunnels?

09:30.504 --> 09:31.536
Why?

09:31.538 --> 09:34.573
You need to see
for yourself to fully grasp

09:34.575 --> 09:35.774
The sitchiation.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.650
(overlapping chatter)

09:50.190 --> 09:52.057
(excitedly)
we're at the <i> fan pick awards!</i>

09:52.059 --> 09:53.925
We're at the <i> fan pick awards!</i>

09:53.927 --> 09:55.193
(breathes heavily)

09:55.195 --> 09:56.895
Okay, josh. Be cool.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.630
(calmly)
we're at the <i> fan pick awards.</i>

09:59.900 --> 10:01.800
I can't hold it in.
We're at the <i> fan pick awards!</i>

Whoo!

10:04.738 --> 10:05.770

10:05.772 --> 10:07.572
Paula porter,
<i>celebrity news now.</i>

10:07.574 --> 10:10.108
-Hi!
-You look beautiful.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.910
Thank you.

10:11.912 --> 10:16.147
Josh wilcox, why do you think
the fans love <i> voltage </i> so much?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.385
I think liv should answer that.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.587
She's worked hard
bringing skyvolt to life.

10:22.589 --> 10:25.724
Liv, I have been dying to ask
you about your part!

10:25.726 --> 10:27.659
And I am just dying
to tell you!

10:27.661 --> 10:31.997
What made you change the part
in your hair from the side,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.965
To the center,
and back to the side?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.937
There was something that
I was going to change,

10:38.939 --> 10:41.139
And it had nothing
to do with my hair.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.675
It was time to change
the conversation.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.010
Jacob michaels:
Liv rooney! Over here!

10:45.012 --> 10:46.911
Jacob michaels
from <i> news meets world.</i>

10:46.913 --> 10:48.580
Let's get a shot
of that dress!

10:48.582 --> 10:50.582
Oh. Where you--
oh! Hello!

10:50.584 --> 10:53.284
Hello. Hi. Hi.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.919
Hi there. Hi.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.524
Um, so, sorry,
are you gonna pan down
over josh's body too or--

10:59.526 --> 11:00.825
Oh, I-- I hope not.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.160
I'm not wearing matching socks.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.929
-(chuckles)
-or shoes.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.999
You are biffing
your first red carpet, josh.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
Maddie:
Are we there yet?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.840
We'll be there when
I tell you we're there!

11:15.842 --> 11:17.776
-Ugh!
-Okay, we're there.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.848
Welcome to parker hollow.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.685
This is where I go

11:26.687 --> 11:29.254
To allow my mind to focus
on my scientific research.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.925
<i>(theme music plays)</i>

11:37.631 --> 11:40.765
And where I sometimes
binge watch <i> linda and heather.</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:44.803
Okay.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.906
So let's just find my book
and get back above ground.

11:47.908 --> 11:51.543
Yeah, so about that...

11:53.246 --> 11:54.979
Sick! There it is!

11:54.981 --> 11:56.381
Wait!

11:56.383 --> 11:59.084
That pillar is the main
support beam for parker hollow.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.720
Touch that book,
and the tunnels will collapse.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.821
And with them...

12:02.823 --> 12:04.723
Our house.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.758
(scoffs)

12:06.760 --> 12:08.093
(laughs)

12:09.062 --> 12:10.495
Oh, that's really funny.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.932
(rumbling)

12:15.168 --> 12:16.267
Oh--

12:17.571 --> 12:19.003
Ah! What?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.505
Dang it!

12:29.216 --> 12:31.983
Like I said,
it's a sitchiation.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.924
Well, there's a rotting
corpse in my locker!

12:39.926 --> 12:41.559
What do I do?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.528
What do I do?!

12:43.530 --> 12:45.029
Joey, you have to
tell the police.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.898
Or at the very least,
the janitor.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.633
(doorbell)

12:51.037 --> 12:52.103
(gasps)

12:52.105 --> 12:54.139
It's dump truck!
Act natural.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.142
Oh! Okay, less natural.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.882
Hey there, mr. Dump truck sir.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.653
Joseph, I came to thank you
for the use of your locker,

13:08.655 --> 13:10.955
And to tell you that
it will be vacated soon.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.725
There's some business
going down tonight.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.795
The less you know,
the better.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.630
Thanks, buddy.
(laughs nervously)

13:18.632 --> 13:21.699
That all sounds super normal
and above board.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.069
As is my way.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.971
A pleasant evening.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.179
Joey, he's moving
the body tonight.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.780
We can catch him red-handed!

13:35.782 --> 13:37.916
Or...

13:37.918 --> 13:40.151
We could just wait 12 hours,

13:40.153 --> 13:41.753
And then it is not
our problem anymore.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.090
You said "our problem."

13:46.092 --> 13:48.560
This murder is
making us a couple!

13:51.698 --> 13:54.032
Ugh, I cannot believe that

13:54.034 --> 13:57.035
You used my library book
to hold up the entire house!

13:57.037 --> 13:58.854
My life is over.

13:58.855 --> 14:00.672
Look, all we have to do is
replace your book in the pillar

14:00.674 --> 14:02.841
With another one
that's the exact same size.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.479
Got it!
Mom's thai cookbook.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.181
Oh, yeah.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.716
She's not gonna miss this.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.785
She's been promising to make us
pad thai for, like, years.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.553
-Back to the tunnels!
-Yes!

14:16.857 --> 14:18.189
Uh, this way, blondie.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.225
There's a shortcut.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.096
What?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.133
No way.
A brand new parker tunnel?

14:29.135 --> 14:32.103
Dude, no wonder you always win
at hide-and-seek.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.744
Who's ready to watch
the <i> fan pick awards</i> --

14:39.746 --> 14:41.045
Oh.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.981
Nobody here.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.251
Guess I'm the only one who's
down with the popular culture.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.656
Please don't be a dead body,
please don't be a dead body,

14:51.658 --> 14:53.691
Please don't be a dead body,
please don't be a dead body.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.226
-(both gasp)
-joey: It's an arm!

14:55.228 --> 14:57.095
It's the arm of tony slim nose!

14:59.833 --> 15:02.166
-I told you not to
open your locker.
-(both gasp)

15:03.603 --> 15:07.138
-(both scream)
-shut your mouths!

15:10.844 --> 15:13.878
Now open 'em back up
to enjoy a piece

15:13.880 --> 15:17.248
Of my uncle martucci
truckberg's family salami.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.252
Both:
What?

15:21.254 --> 15:24.255
We're going to kill
tony slim nose.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.158
In a taste contest.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.231
This whole thing
was about salami?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.766
Yeah.

15:34.768 --> 15:39.270
What, you didn't think nothing
nefarious was going on, did you?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.806
Both:
Us? No.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.144
One question though.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.245
Huh?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.948
Why did you have to store
the salami in my locker?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.884
Because it's the last place
tony slim nose would look.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.385
They clearly don't understand

15:54.387 --> 15:56.721
The cut-throat nature
of the salami business.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.790
(snorts)
yeah. Let's go.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.558
-Knuckleheads.
-Tell me about it.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.226
(uncle martucci laughs)

16:07.567 --> 16:09.133
Thank you.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.771
(gasps)
liv rooney! You're back in la!

16:13.773 --> 16:14.973
Kristen bell!

16:14.975 --> 16:16.207
-Hello!
-Hi!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.509
No way! No way!

16:18.511 --> 16:19.677
No way!

16:19.679 --> 16:21.913
I'm on the red carpet
with kristen bell!

16:21.915 --> 16:23.614
I'm talking to kristen bell!

16:23.616 --> 16:25.616
(laughs hysterically)
hi, kristen bell! I'm--

16:25.618 --> 16:26.918
I'm kristen josh.
I mean--

16:28.788 --> 16:30.021
Hi.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.889
-Hi.
-You are blowing this, josh!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.159
He's cute.
It's his first time?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.095
Yeah. Wow, how could you tell?

16:37.097 --> 16:40.098
You guys got past
the microphone circus okay?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.700
Yeah. I mean, sort of.
Most of the questions were...

16:42.702 --> 16:46.004
They're just variations of
"clothes!" "you wear clothes!"

16:46.006 --> 16:47.772
"why these clothes?" "hair!"

16:47.774 --> 16:49.207
(both laugh)

16:49.209 --> 16:50.174
Yes. Exactly.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.011
Kristen bell and liv rooney!

16:53.013 --> 16:54.946
Two of my favorite blondes!

16:54.948 --> 16:57.115
Quick question:
Love your hair!

17:00.453 --> 17:02.720
That's not a question.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.490
All that I could think about

17:05.492 --> 17:06.724
Were the girls
watching me at home,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.327
And it was so important to me
that they hear me talk

17:09.329 --> 17:11.129
About more than
just my appearance.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.400
Do you wanna do something
about these dumb questions?

17:17.404 --> 17:19.203
Are you saying
we tackle these reporters,

17:19.205 --> 17:20.738
Grab their mics,
head into the parking lot

17:20.740 --> 17:21.973
And bash their headlights in?

17:21.975 --> 17:25.343
-Oh, I'm in then!
-All right. Okay.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.811
-Yes!
-Okay, no, no.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.346
-I'm in.
-So-- so dial it down.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.548
-I don't know.
That was a great plan.
-You--

17:32.352 --> 17:33.384
(grunts)

17:33.386 --> 17:34.886
Last time you were
this worked up was

17:34.888 --> 17:36.320
After serena and venus williams

17:36.322 --> 17:39.490
Beat us in that charity
tennis match last summer, so...

17:39.492 --> 17:42.226
-That ball was out.
-No, it was not.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.729
We've been over this,
like, a million times.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.330
-It was out.
-They beat us six-love six-love.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.732
I can't remember, but...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.233
-Okay, focus! K-bell!
-I think it was out.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.334
K-bell...

17:50.336 --> 17:52.670
We are changing
the conversation.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.405
-Okay.
-Yeah.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.840
-All right.
-Yeah.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.675
You start.
I will back you up.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.010
Okay.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.445
-Liv rooney.
-Liv: Yeah?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.547
You are the prettiest
superhero on tv.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.915
Talk about that.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.853
Um, actually, I would like to
talk about something more.

18:08.855 --> 18:13.257
Um... Not one reporter has
asked me, you know...

18:13.259 --> 18:14.926
How I feel about
playing a superhero,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.594
Or how I do the stunts,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.596
Or what heroes inspired me.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.266
You guys have only asked me
about my dress and my hair.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.468
Boom!

18:23.470 --> 18:25.269
-Busted, jacob michaels.
-Busted.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.306
Hey, liv rooney just played you.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.475
-Let's talk about that.
-Uh-- (laughs nervously)

18:30.477 --> 18:33.411
Well, she's america's
sweetheart, all right?

18:33.413 --> 18:36.948
Those are the questions
that our audience expects.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.584
Or is it what
they're told to expect

18:39.586 --> 18:42.920
By a group of people
who don't think to dig
a little deeper?

18:42.922 --> 18:46.157
Whoo! You are on fire
right now, k-bell!

18:46.159 --> 18:49.060
Thank you, l-roon.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.928
Yeah, and-- and also--

18:50.930 --> 18:53.931
I mean, don't we have
an obligation to encourage

18:53.933 --> 18:55.967
Our fans to expect more?

18:55.969 --> 18:59.303
I love fashion,
but that is not the only thing

18:59.305 --> 19:01.472
That women in show business
care about, you know?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.940
I mean, ask us more.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.143
Drop that knowledge, liv.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.615
Yeah. And-- and girls,
you are you,

19:10.617 --> 19:14.752
And you are so much more
than just your appearance.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.155
-I think that's it.
-Okay.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.422
-Oh wait! No!
-Oh.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.924
Hi, mom!

19:23.329 --> 19:24.862
What was that?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.697
That's just how
I say hi to my momma.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.032
Do you-- can I--
can I borrow that?

19:28.034 --> 19:30.001
-I mean, like, yeah.
-Okay. Hey.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.702
Hey, kids!

19:42.815 --> 19:47.285
Okay, when the parker-tronic
hydraulic pogo lift triggers,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.787
It'll take the stress off
the pillar for two seconds.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.222
That's when you swap the books.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.890
(breathes deeply)
I got this.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.560
You can do this, mad dog.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.629
-It's a lot of pressure,
but you thrive on that.
-Yeah, I do.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.464
Just think about
swapping the books.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.466
Not about how if you fail,
it'll destroy our home

20:02.468 --> 20:05.403
-And suck us into the earth
for a certain, painful death.
-Okay, parker!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.879
Hey! Parker, where are you?!

20:14.881 --> 20:17.315
Parker:
<i>Rooting for you to succeed...</i>

20:18.484 --> 20:20.384
<i>From a secure location.</i>

20:22.488 --> 20:23.588
<i>Good luck, sis.</i>

20:23.590 --> 20:24.822
(walkie talkie buzzes)

20:24.824 --> 20:27.058
(parker-tronic buzzes)

20:27.060 --> 20:29.060
(rumbling)

20:33.032 --> 20:35.099
Ah! Oh!

20:50.083 --> 20:52.516
(gasps)

20:52.518 --> 20:54.185
Oh, I did it!

20:54.187 --> 20:56.287
I got the book!

20:58.358 --> 20:59.824
I knew we could do it, maddie!

21:04.797 --> 21:07.398
Hey, guys! So we are
on the set of <i> voltage,</i>

21:07.400 --> 21:09.100
And we have a few minutes
to answer some questions,

21:09.102 --> 21:10.401
So fire away!

21:10.403 --> 21:12.103
Um, this one's from elisa.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.739
"liv, I loved what you said
at the <i> fan pick awards.</i>

21:14.741 --> 21:16.774
"girls are more than just
their appearance.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.944
What is the biggest
risk you've taken?"

21:19.946 --> 21:21.879
Wow! Um...

21:21.881 --> 21:24.548
Great question.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.651
I told her
that my biggest risk,

21:26.653 --> 21:28.552
Um, was leaving home
to follow my dreams

21:28.554 --> 21:32.290
Of becoming an actress,
and then they asked me

21:32.292 --> 21:36.661
About who my role models were,
and which charities I support.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.796
(chuckles)

21:38.798 --> 21:40.631
Look at us.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.000
We just changed
the conversation a little bit.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.137
(chuckles)

21:46.138 --> 21:49.273
Here's another one.
"liv, what accomplishment
are you most proud of?"

21:49.275 --> 21:51.342
Um...

21:51.344 --> 21:53.611
Well, right now, it's kind of
the fact that that is

21:53.613 --> 21:55.446
The question that
you just chose to ask.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.214
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.686
Hey, has anyone out there
changed the conversation?

22:01.688 --> 22:04.188
And if so, reach out
and let us know

22:04.190 --> 22:05.856
How it made a difference
in your life.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.059
Yeah, l-roon would
love to see that.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.931
Yeah... It's really only k-bell
who gets to call me l-roon.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.734
Biffed it again, josh!

22:23.276 --> 22:24.542
All right!

22:24.544 --> 22:25.643
Here.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.011
<i>Dribble queen.</i>

22:27.013 --> 22:29.613
Now will you please
release my transcripts

22:29.615 --> 22:32.350
So that I can go to college
and live the life that
I was born to live?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.687
Everything seems to be in order.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.725
-(tablet beeps)
-I have restored
your once sullied name.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.594
But I'm watching you.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.901
Sick!

22:50.903 --> 22:53.671
All right, now all I need
is my birth certificate

22:53.673 --> 22:56.807
And my college applications
will be complete.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.343
Not a problem, I know
exactly where that is.

22:59.345 --> 23:02.113
You see, I keep
everyone's important papers
in my thai cookbook.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.616
Your thai cookbook?

23:08.721 --> 23:12.056
In her thai cookbook.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.391
(intense music plays)

23:16.696 --> 23:17.928
Parker: <i> It's a sitchiation.</i>
