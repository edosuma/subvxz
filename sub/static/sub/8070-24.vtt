DARLENE: Boy, this Mother's
Day thing really bites.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.448
Yeah.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.485
A whole Sunday totally wasted.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.354
It's like her birthday
wasn't enough.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.322
You know what?

00:21.422 --> 00:22.690
Your mom works
real hard all year.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.226
And she deserves one day when
she can relax and do nothing.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.394
Well, what about us?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.829
I don't remember us
getting, like, a kids day?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.099
Some day, my precious
angel, you will be a parent

00:31.199 --> 00:33.867
and you will realize that
every day is kids day.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.272
Oh man, you just want to
smack them when they say that.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.473
Well, OK.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.242
I didn't park in the
driveway just like you told

00:41.342 --> 00:43.677
me, cleaned the entire
house, went shopping

00:43.777 --> 00:45.546
for all the barbecue items.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.047
I wonder if there's
anything else I can do

00:47.148 --> 00:50.484
while I'm queen for a damn day.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.585
Did you remember the beer?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.924
Just wait till Father's Day.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.130
Well, you do not have
to go to a station break

01:02.230 --> 01:04.365
when I'm here in the
middle of my opinion.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.299
No.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.200
All right.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.101
All right.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.402
Do it your way.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.303
I'm on hold.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.938
What's the topic?

01:11.038 --> 01:12.206
Meat.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.843
This Ted from Toledo thinks
it's mean to kill cows.

01:15.943 --> 01:16.810
What does he want us to do?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.746
Eat them alive?

01:18.846 --> 01:19.980
That That is very good.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.149
I'm going to use that.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.583
What took you so long?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.319
She made me pull over three
times so she could phone

01:25.419 --> 01:26.887
in and express her outrage.

01:26.987 --> 01:27.921
Listen, Jackie.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.023
You be glad that you
live in a country

01:30.124 --> 01:33.394
where anybody can pull over
to a Stuckey's and express

01:33.494 --> 01:34.862
their freedom of speech.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.265
And get a nice pecan log.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.166
Hey, Ted.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.733
Listen to me.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.968
I am at a barbecue.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.070
What do you suggest
we put on the grill?

01:43.171 --> 01:45.573
Broccoli?

01:45.673 --> 01:46.540
When did you guys get here?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.441
A couple of minutes ago.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.342
Just a minute.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.377
Hold on.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.580
Danny, my favorite
grandson-in-law.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.514
Hey, kids.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.216
Nana Mary is here.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.550
Giving them what for, Grandma?

01:56.650 --> 01:57.585
I'm trying to.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.220
But you know, the
kind of people that

01:59.320 --> 02:01.289
call into these
talk shows, they're

02:01.389 --> 02:02.790
not the brightest in the world.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.760
Hi, Nana Mary.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.661
Nana Mary.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.762
Wait a minute.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.030
Hold on, hold on.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.067
My three gorgeous great
grandchildren just walked in.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.035
And guess what?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
You're never going
to believe it.

02:16.237 --> 02:19.673
But little Darlene has boobies.

[theme music]

[cackles]

03:13.327 --> 03:15.329
Do you remember
that Ethel Schneider?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.230
Remember her?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.298
I told you about her.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.400
She lived in the
apartment across the hall?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.501
Yeah.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.370
The one with the rich
grandson that would

03:22.470 --> 03:24.705
be perfect for you, Jackie?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
That's the one.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.075
What about her?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.010
Dead.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.445
Oh God.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.347
Well, is the grandson
going to be at the funeral?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.349
Because you could wear the black
sweater with the scoop neck.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.318
Will you two please
just knock it off?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.720
I don't want to talk about
my love life anymore.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.055
And I don't want to
talk about dead people.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.258
Is it all right if I
talk about my love life?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.526
JACKIE: Yes, fine.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.928
Well, you remember that
Marvin Spencer I told you about?

03:48.028 --> 03:50.864
He was the one with
the hot pants for me?

03:50.964 --> 03:51.765
Oh yeah.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.100
So he asked you out?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.535
Yes, once.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.037
Oh, we had a wonderful time.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.139
He never called me again.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.708
JACKIE: Why not?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.843
Dead.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.645
I'm leaving.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.779
You coward.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.247
Grandma, you oughta
move in with us

04:07.348 --> 04:10.484
so we could do this to
Jackie all the time.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.220
Roseanne, we've been
through this before.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.589
Suppose I didn't
like living here.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.457
Then you'd fit right in.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.128
Can I bring anything
out to the table?

04:21.228 --> 04:23.030
Chips or dip or something?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.131
No.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.566
I don't want you to
take anything, Crystal.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.900
Now, Roseanne.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.902
Just because I'm pregnant
doesn't mean I can't pitch in.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.438
Crystal, it's because
you eat everything

04:30.538 --> 04:32.540
before you get it out there.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.108
Well, baby's hungry.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.710
You keep feeding
him like that, he's

04:36.810 --> 04:37.845
never going to want to leave.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.454
Mary, I can't tell you how
good it is to see you again.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.355
Yeah.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.756
Me too, sweetheart.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.491
You know you've
always been gorgeous.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.926
But right now you're
simply glowing.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.597
Wow, what a nice thing to say.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.066
I'm glad to see that bad
manners don't run in the family.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.803
Who is that again?

05:05.973 --> 05:06.774
That's Crystal.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.443
You know, she married Dan's dad.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.544
Oh, right.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.579
Look.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.914
I don't like to talk
bad about people.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.015
Never.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.317
And I know she's one
of your best friends.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.852
But that's a sick thing.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.357
- Company.
- Hey.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.257
Hey, hi.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.526
I'm glad you could make it.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.460
I made deviled eggs.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.528
Where do you want
me to put them?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.429
Take them out back.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.798
But don't let Crystal see them.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.299
Hey, this must be Chuck, Jr.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.200
Mhm.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.402
Couldn't be.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.304
The Chuck Junior who I fed
and clothed for 16 years

05:37.405 --> 05:38.872
would never have
forgotten Mother's Day.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.773
Oh, Ma.

05:39.873 --> 05:40.674
Shut up.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.777
Hello?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.078
Oh yeah.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.048
This is Chuck and Marie
and the evil Chuck,

05:48.148 --> 05:50.751
Jr. This is my
grandmother, Mary.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.652
Wow.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.953
It's nice to meet you.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.054
Nice to meet you, too.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.389
It's a real pleasure.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.090
Yes, me too.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.326
And I want you to know
I'm not prejudiced.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.634
[music playing]

06:13.073 --> 06:15.976
Ann-Marie, these
deviled eggs are good.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.778
I should've made more.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.548
Oh, baby just kicked.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.149
It's OK, honey.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.752
We're at a barbecue at
your brother Dan's house.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.153
And all our friends are here.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.358
I read that you should talk
to the baby in the womb

06:31.459 --> 06:33.861
so that he can get
used to your voice.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.263
And he can even
understand a little.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.164
Hey, baby.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.165
Back off the buffet.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.506
NANA MARY: Rosie.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.074
What?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.909
NANA MARY: I need a big bowl.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.879
Uh, it's in the
cupboard next to the sink.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.946
Do you believe her?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.515
She throws me out of
my own damn kitchen

06:54.615 --> 06:57.050
so she can make her
secret potato salad.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.652
Isn't she great?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.553
Uh oh.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.621
We're out of coffee.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.289
I'll go make some more.
- Forget about it.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.491
This ain't work.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.792
If people want more coffee,
they can go in there

07:04.892 --> 07:06.059
and make it theirselves.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.797
That's just what she
says at the restaurant.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.731
Bonnie, hey.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.432
How come your
husband didn't show?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.333
Oh, Duke.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.535
He couldn't come.

07:14.635 --> 07:18.539
He's still got 20 hours of
community service to do.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.041
Look at the sweater my
daughter sent me from Oregon.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.242
CRYSTAL: It's really
pretty, Bonnie.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
Nice color for you.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.479
Now she remembered
Mother's Day

07:25.579 --> 07:27.715
and she's all the way in Oregon.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.183
Oh, Ma.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.686
You know, There's
worse things, Ann-Marie.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.855
My kids all got together and
chipped in and bought me some

07:34.955 --> 07:37.390
of these strawberry bath beads.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.926
I'm giving them
out for Halloween.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.130
NANA MARY: Rosie.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.832
What?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.768
NANA MARY: Where do you
keep the Tabasco sauce?

07:47.868 --> 07:50.938
In the fridge door.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.039
Hey.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.241
She puts Tabasco sauce
in the potato salad.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.242
NANA MARY: No way.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.310
I'm making myself a Bloody Mary.

08:02.182 --> 08:02.983
Say,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.184
Dan.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.654
You know you might
think about stacking

08:06.754 --> 08:09.322
those coals like a pyramid.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.124
No, no, no, no, no.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.794
See, this way you get them
all with the lighter fluid.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.229
You stack them, you miss
the ones in the middle.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.734
Why don't you spray them
first and stack them after?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.069
No, no, no.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.104
See, all your fluid's going
to evaporate if you do that.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.005
Trust me.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.239
They light better this way.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.741
Now see, I disagree.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.476
See, the way you've got
them, they're all spread

08:29.577 --> 08:31.211
out working it all alone.

08:31.311 --> 08:35.382
But if you stack them,
they're working like a team.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.118
Well, let me ask
you something, Chuck.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.620
Once you have them
stacked in a pyramid,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.088
are you going to
cook in a pyramid.

08:41.188 --> 08:41.989
Of course not.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.523
You're going to spread them out.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.092
Well, if they're going
to wind up spread out,

08:45.192 --> 08:46.694
why not start them spread out?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.130
See, Dan.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.799
You don't understand.
- No.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.901
I understand.
You're just arguing in circles.

08:54.001 --> 08:54.668
That's all.
- Listen.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.468
No, Dan.
If--

08:55.569 --> 08:57.871
Well, you know what I'd do?

08:57.971 --> 08:59.740
The ones that didn't
light, I'd like blast them

08:59.840 --> 09:01.508
with another shot of the fluid.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.876
[interposing voices]

09:02.976 --> 09:04.778
You blast hot
coals with lighter

09:04.878 --> 09:08.616
fluid, you're going to get
blown into next week, man.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.618
[interposing voices]

09:10.718 --> 09:11.518
Fine.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.659
So Dan, you know those burgers
are looking pretty thick.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.929
I don't think they're
going to cook.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.430

18:49.796 --> 18:51.063
You owe me $112 bucks.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.203
Can't you even stay and have
a cup of coffee before you go?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.337
No, no.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.005

19:17.089 --> 19:18.258
You always say no.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.259
Yeah.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.093
Well, I might say yes some time.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.863
How do you know that?

19:23.963 --> 19:24.997

19:25.097 --> 19:27.800
Oh, for crying out loud.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.168
Grandma, come live with us.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.069
It won't be a burden.

We'll make room.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.605
OK?

19:32.705 --> 19:33.506
No.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.675
She's got to say it.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.809
You're nothing to her.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.978
See?

19:39.078 --> 19:39.879

doesn't want me around here.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.842

horrible old lady.

20:09.942 --> 20:10.743

20:10.843 --> 20:11.944
