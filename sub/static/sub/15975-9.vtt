00:06.740 --> 00:08.572
<i>Casey: Said Watters
following the game,</i>

00:08.641 --> 00:10.405
<i>"Ricky Watters
isn't lugging the rock</i>

00:10.477 --> 00:13.208
<i>the way Ricky Watters is
capable of lugging the rock."</i>

00:13.279 --> 00:14.542
Fill it.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.104
Dan, do you think
there's any chance

00:16.181 --> 00:17.980
Ricky Waiters wasn't talking
about himself

00:18.051 --> 00:19.450
in the third person,
but rather

00:19.519 --> 00:21.817
was talking about someone else
in the second person?

00:21.888 --> 00:23.356
Who did you have in mind?

00:23.423 --> 00:25.858
Oh, Ricky Waiters,
the rock lugger from Toledo.

00:25.925 --> 00:26.687
[Laughter]

00:26.760 --> 00:28.285
Dynamite fill.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.294
<i>That will do it for us.</i>

00:29.362 --> 00:30.955
Get some rest.
You're gonna need it...

00:31.031 --> 00:32.555
'cause we're coming back
in 23 hours.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.623
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.601
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.364
-- We'll see you tomorrow.
-- Good night.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.303
<i>Dave: Music.
Will: Go.</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:40.498
-- <i>Animation.
Chris: Go.</i>

00:40.573 --> 00:43.235
<i>Kim: We're out.
Dana: Very nice.</i>

00:43.309 --> 00:45.368
-- Her name is Pixley.
-- Pixie?

00:45.445 --> 00:46.879
-- Pixley.
-- Spell it for me.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.744
P-I-X-L-E-Y.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.647
I am going out tonight
with a girl named Pixley.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.741
Where did you meet her?

00:51.818 --> 00:53.308
Oh, she works in the building.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.855
And what does Pixley do?
I'm not 100% sure.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.720
-- She didn't tell you?
-- She did tell me.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.587
I just wasn't paying attention.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.285
-- Good show. -- Thanks.
-- Thank you.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.021
You weren't paying attention
to Pixley?

01:02.095 --> 01:04.995
Are you just looking for any reason
at all to say the name Pixley?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.362
It's starting to grow on me.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.162
[Sighs] I cannot even begin
to tell you how much

01:08.234 --> 01:09.702
lam not looking forward
to this.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.430
I think you might have
a good time with Pixley.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.199
This isn't a pleasure date
I'm going on.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.832
This is a requirement,
like Home Ec.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.398
-- You had to take Home Ec?
-- Yeah.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.705
Me too.
Did you learn anything?

01:17.777 --> 01:21.179
-- Now I can do this thing where you hollow
out a grapefruit. -- I learned that.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.511
Well, tonight the nonsense
officially begins.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.607
Well, for most of us,

01:24.684 --> 01:26.482
the nonsense began
a long time ago,

01:26.553 --> 01:29.045
so, you know,
welcome to the world.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.783
Six months on the Dana Whitaker
dating program.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.951
I don't think
it's gonna be six months.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.653
Oh, it's gonna be six months.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.025
-- I <i>don't think it is.</i> -- <i>How long
do you think it's going to be?</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.122
-- <i>One night.</i>
-- <i>You're wrong.</i>

01:39.199 --> 01:41.998
-- <i>It's not gonna</i> be <i>six months.</i> -- <i>Ah,
Dana's pretty good at digging her heels in.</i>

01:42.068 --> 01:43.763
-- In fact, if you want to check my back...
-- One night.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.168
You're gonna go on one date.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.673
Dana will get jealous,
call the whole thing off.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.105
No, Dana's not going to
get jealous.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.734
She will get jealous of Pixley.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.471
Jealousy will rear
its ugly head.

01:52.545 --> 01:54.445
It will not rear its ugly head.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.482
It will rear its ugly head,
it will look around,

01:56.549 --> 01:58.415
and then it will...eat Tokyo.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.647
-- Hmm.
-- See?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.711
-- Yeah, I like the sound of that.
-- I like the sound of “Pixley.“

02:02.789 --> 02:04.257
-- Can I ask you something?
-- Sure.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.156
<i>After you bungle
this thing tonight</i>

02:06.226 --> 02:07.250
and send Pixley stomping
out of the restaurant,

02:07.327 --> 02:09.158
do you have any problem
with me giving her a call?

02:09.229 --> 02:11.254
I don't have any problem with you
giving her a call right now.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.560
Don't be rude to her.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.031
Why would I be rude to her?

02:14.100 --> 02:16.296
-- <i>It's what you do.</i>
-- <i>It's not what I do.</i>

02:16.369 --> 02:18.030
-- One more thing -- honesty.
-- <i>What?</i>

02:18.104 --> 02:19.435
-- <i>What about it?</i>
-- <i>Don't mislead her.</i>

02:19.506 --> 02:21.804
Be honest with her.
This Pixley's a good girl.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.502
-- You've never met her.
-- <i>I</i> can <i>tell</i> already.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.101
-- How?
-- Her name's Pixley.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.270
Danny, I'm going now.

02:26.346 --> 02:27.973
-- <i>On your date with Pixley?</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:28.047 --> 02:29.742
-- Can <i>I</i> come?
-- Good night.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.783
Honesty for Pixley!

02:30.850 --> 02:32.284
Yeah, yeah.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.277
Casey's going out tonight
with a girl named Pixley.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.086
-- I know. You know what I'm concerned
about? -- You're concerned about Pixley.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.319
I'm not concerned
about Pixley.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.655
You know what
I'm concerned about?

02:40.727 --> 02:43.059
-- The dating plan blowing up in your face?
-- VVhere are we right now?

02:43.129 --> 02:45.791
-- Natalie... -- New York City...
the city of lights.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.458
Paris is the city of lights.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.332
We got a lot of lights, Dana.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.393
Yes, but my point is
that we're in the office,

02:51.471 --> 02:54.566
and this is where I like
to talk about work.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.042
-- You know what I'm concerned about?
-- Tomorrow's rundown?

02:57.110 --> 03:00.136
-- I don't think there's gonna be enough
show. -- Tomorrow's a strange day.

03:00.213 --> 03:03.342
The schedules are empty -- no press
conferences and no pre-tape in the can.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.884
Two hockey games.
That's all we've got.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.715
We can always rerun
tonight's show.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.278
-- Natalie -- -- Then again, I suppose
that would be fundamentally wrong.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.052
-- Yes, I'm pretty worried.
-- About Pixley?

03:12.125 --> 03:13.183
Listen...

03:13.259 --> 03:15.455
<i>10 past midnight --
quittin' time, baby.</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:17.860
And this is when I like to talk
about your personal life.

03:17.931 --> 03:18.864
Dana.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.127
Aah! Yeah! Yes?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.725
Here I go.

03:21.801 --> 03:22.859
Have fun.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.404
Your dating plan begins.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.437
I'll be here working.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.030
-- Aha!
-- What?

03:27.106 --> 03:28.835
Jealousy rears its ugly head.

03:28.908 --> 03:30.103
-- <i>Where?</i>
-- <i>It'll happen.</i>

03:30.176 --> 03:31.166
Okay.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.235
-- I'm outta here.
-- Okay.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.441
You understand
the next time you see me,

03:35.515 --> 03:37.415
I'll have already gone
on the date.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.282
I do grasp the time-space
continuum, yes.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.685
<i>Well, then...here I go.</i>

03:42.755 --> 03:43.779
Enjoy.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.381
For the record,
if she stays over,

03:45.458 --> 03:47.927
I'm making her this thing
where I hollow out a grapefruit.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.484
-- From Home Ec?
-- Yeah.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.529
Go.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.224
I'll go when I'm ready to go.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.763
-- Now I'm ready to go.
-- <i>Bye.</i>

03:56.502 --> 03:57.628
Well, you want to get to work?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.730
Her name's Pixley?

04:12.819 --> 04:13.752
Hey, Isaac.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.787
Hey, Jeremy.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.720
<i>You working out
on the treadmill?</i>

04:16.789 --> 04:18.017
What makes you say that?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.752
-- How's it goin'?
-- Fine.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.195
Hey, if I were to suddenly
pop this thing to up to 10,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.322
would you just go flying out
onto Fifth Avenue?

04:25.398 --> 04:28.299
Yeah, but if I were to have my hands
around your throat when you did it,

04:28.368 --> 04:30.063
wouldn't you be
coming out there with me?

04:30.136 --> 04:31.695
-- Yeah.
-- So it's a wash.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.865
-- Yeah.
-- [ Sighs]

04:33.940 --> 04:37.035
Are you on Isaac patrol tonight?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.134
Isaac patrol?

04:38.211 --> 04:39.770
Yeah, doesn't one of you

04:39.846 --> 04:40.745
stay after the show

04:40.813 --> 04:41.939
to make sure I get

04:42.015 --> 04:43.210
into my car okay?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.183
Yes, and doesn't that make us
rotten people?

04:45.251 --> 04:48.346
There are plenty of reasons
why you're rotten people.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.482
I'm not on Isaac patrol.
Dan is on Isaac patrol.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.356
-- Where's Casey? -- Uh, out
with a girl named Pixley.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.225
-- Casey's outwith Pixley?
-- Yes.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.288
You suppose the two of them
could be any more white?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.992
No, I don't imagine they could.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.024
So what do you need?

05:02.101 --> 05:05.503
What do <i>I</i> need?
I don't need anything, Isaac.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.039
You're simply here?

05:07.106 --> 05:08.096
I'm simply here.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.302
-- <i>You know</i> why?
-- <i>My lucky day, I guess.</i>

05:10.376 --> 05:13.004
-- No, although I thought that was
funny, what you just said. -- Thank you.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.173
So, I've been nominated
for this award tomorrow night

05:15.248 --> 05:17.444
-- for producing the segment
on Foxboro. -- <i>Hmm.</i>

05:17.517 --> 05:19.076
And I've been thinking about it,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.052
and I've decided
that I want to win.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.111
-- Interesting.
-- I want to win <i>bad,</i> Isaac.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.816
-- Yes.
-- Do you know that feeling?

05:24.891 --> 05:27.223
Well, I work in sports,
<i>so</i> I'm trying to think

05:27.293 --> 05:29.660
if I've ever had contact
with people like that.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.493
-- Another good one, sir.
-- [Laughs]

05:31.564 --> 05:33.396
Surviving a stroke
has made you quite the wit.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.399
Yes.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.798
No, I was wondering --

05:35.868 --> 05:39.566
as someone who's been nominated for many
of these things and lost most of the time,

05:39.639 --> 05:42.802
how you felt on the question of
preparing a speech in advance.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.741
I won the Pulitzer Prize,
Jeremy.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.142
It's a real honor, sir.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.510
No, I meant it's one of
the many objects in the room

05:48.581 --> 05:50.811
-- that I could grab and
shove up -- -- Got it.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.545
So on this
speech-preparation question --

05:53.619 --> 05:56.350
Have in mind the people
you want to thank.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.890
-- Ah.
-- Anything else?

05:57.957 --> 05:59.516
-- Have them in mind.
-- Yes.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.185
-- VVell, there would definitely be you...
-- Thank you.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.227
...and Dana and Natalie...

06:02.295 --> 06:05.196
-- Good. -- ...th0ugh I'm not
sure which name to say first.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.857
Dana's the executive producer,

06:06.933 --> 06:09.925
but I've got a personal
relationship with Natalie.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.596
Of course, this isn't about
personal relationships.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.902
It's about work.
Or is it?

06:14.974 --> 06:17.204
Tell you what,
let's talk about it.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.607
Okay, but first,

06:18.678 --> 06:21.613
would you mind just popping
this thing up to 10 for me?

06:21.681 --> 06:24.013
Alphabetical order
is one way to go.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.482
<i>Dana: Let's add 'em all up.</i>

06:25.551 --> 06:27.713
Total time --
whole show all in --

06:27.787 --> 06:28.879
-- The Bruins...
-- Yeah.

06:28.955 --> 06:29.945
-- The Rangers...
-- Yeah.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.387
-- NFL Whiparound.
-- Yep.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.618
What do we got?

06:32.692 --> 06:34.421
6 minutes and 25 seconds.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.326
We usually do
more like an hour, don't we?

06:36.396 --> 06:39.798
Yeah. All right, you know,
let's not go crazy.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.698
Let's approach this
like the people we are.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.668
Dana, I'm kind of late
for a date with a girl --

06:43.736 --> 06:46.603
<i>Sit your ass down,
Valentino.</i>

06:46.672 --> 06:48.140
What's up?

06:48.207 --> 06:49.368
What are you still doing here?

06:49.442 --> 06:51.240
I'm on Isaac patrol.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.472
-- <i>How's he doin'?</i>
-- <i>I don't know.</i>

06:53.546 --> 06:54.536
Where is he?

06:54.614 --> 06:56.048
I don't know.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.049
Well, keep up the good work.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.050
What's goin' on?

06:59.118 --> 07:02.577
<i>We only have 6 minutes and 25
seconds worth of show for tomorrow.</i>

07:02.655 --> 07:03.747
-- No problem.
-- No problem?

07:03.823 --> 07:05.848
-- I can <i>stretch it.</i>
-- <i>You can't stretch it.</i>

07:05.925 --> 07:08.257
<i>Dana, I'm a writer.
I stretch things all the time.</i>

07:08.327 --> 07:10.421
Give me 6 minutes
and 25 seconds worth of copy,

07:10.496 --> 07:11.895
and I'll stretch it
into an hour.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.022
I've done it before.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.191
No, you haven't.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.201
You've stretched
6 minutes and 25 seconds

07:16.269 --> 07:19.068
<i>into</i> 7 <i>minutes and 25 seconds.</i>

07:19.138 --> 07:20.071
Hmm.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.834
It certainly <i>seemed</i> like
an hour.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.966
<i>Yes.</i>

07:23.042 --> 07:24.476
What did you find out?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.672
Isaac says I should keep
some names in mind.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.145
What are you talking about?

07:28.214 --> 07:29.204
I'm trying to decide
whom to thank.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.478
There isn't the time allotted to
thank everyone who deserves it,

07:31.551 --> 07:32.746
and I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings,

07:32.819 --> 07:33.911
especially on an occasion
like this.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.454
Whom do you name?
Whom do you leave out?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.649
It's tough.
Isaac's giving me a hand.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.657
Why?
What were you talking about?

07:39.725 --> 07:41.386
Tomorrow's show, you matzo ball.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.761
Well, that opens up a slot.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.560
<i>What about Darren Keehoe?</i>

07:46.632 --> 07:49.158
-- <i>What about him?</i>
-- <i>He's on his death bed.</i>

07:49.235 --> 07:50.464
I like it.

07:50.536 --> 07:51.765
Do you know who he is?

07:51.838 --> 07:55.138
I'm assuming he's an extremely
accomplished athlete

07:55.208 --> 07:57.575
who's lived
an extraordinary life

07:57.643 --> 08:01.443
and whose death warrants a 45-minute
feature on our show tomorrow night

08:01.514 --> 08:03.482
despite the fact
that I've never heard of him.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.641
Am I right?

08:04.717 --> 08:06.207
-- Absolutely.
-- Who <i>is</i> he?

08:06.285 --> 08:08.913
He came this close
to winning the bronze medal

08:08.988 --> 08:10.956
in archery
at the 1932 Olympics.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.320
How close?

08:12.391 --> 08:13.358
He came in seventh.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.088
All right. He's dying?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.096
Yes.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.495
-- You got this off the wire?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

08:19.565 --> 08:20.623
<i>Did it say
what he's dying from?</i>

08:20.700 --> 08:21.895
-- What he's dying from?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

08:21.968 --> 08:23.868
A rare and fatal disease,
perhaps,

08:23.936 --> 08:26.200
that we can serve to bring
public attention to.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.206
[ Crunch! ]

08:28.274 --> 08:31.107
He's dying from having
been alive for 98 years.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.544
[Breathes deeply] All right.
Here's what I'd like.

08:34.614 --> 08:37.241
I'd like everyone to go back
to your offices or cubicles

08:37.316 --> 08:39.876
and return here in 30 minutes
with either some ideas

08:39.952 --> 08:42.511
or a carton containing
the contents of your desk.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.147
-- Can we order Chinese food?
-- Yes.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.191
-- Beef with broccoli?
Fried rice? -- Sure.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.818
-- Jeremy...What?
-- Would you like to pay for it?

08:47.894 --> 08:50.124
I'm giving you an opportunity
to get back on the list, Dana.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.129
Please go.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.063
Go I shall.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.429
Let's work.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.132
Dana...Dana.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.639
-- Yeah?
-- I know it's a dumb award,

09:00.706 --> 09:02.401
but Jeremy wants to win it
pretty bad.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.874
[Laughs]
That's fine with me.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.411
I mean, he really wants to win.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.413
I'll tell you, winning some awards
around here wouldn't hurt us any.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.540
-- He's not gonna win.
-- He's got a good chance.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.108
No, I'm saying
it's not gonna happen.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.155
You know something
I don't know?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.316
You know how for these things
when they know you won

09:18.391 --> 09:20.223
they call you to make sure
you're going to be there?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.227
-- You overheard a call?
-- Yeah.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.059
Tsk.
Who's gonna win?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.962
-- Not Jeremy.
-- Who?

09:26.032 --> 09:27.761
I'm not gonna tell you.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.564
-- Who?
-- You're not going to like it.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.037
I'm not gonna care.
I'm just curious. Who?

09:33.105 --> 09:34.595
You're not gonna care?

09:34.674 --> 09:36.335
-- I'm really not.
-- Sally.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.209
S-S-S-Sally.

09:39.278 --> 09:40.507
Yes.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.844
My Sally?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.041
Casey's Sally.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.982
Sally's going to win my award.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.281
Jeremy's award.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.685
[Sighs]

09:53.759 --> 09:55.659
So you're going to tell him?

09:55.728 --> 09:56.923
-- No.
-- You're not?

09:57.997 --> 09:58.691
No.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.630
You sure?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.293
Yeah.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.336
Okay.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.698
We've got 6 minutes
and 25 seconds of show,

10:09.775 --> 10:13.712
and our best hope is that a guy
nobody's ever heard of

10:13.779 --> 10:15.804
dies of nothing in particular.

10:15.881 --> 10:19.112
Jeremy's got his heart set
on winning an award

10:19.185 --> 10:22.678
that you're not going to tell
him he's already lost...

10:22.755 --> 10:25.781
And Casey's out right now
with a girl named Pixley.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.292
-- Yes! Yes.
-- Well...

10:27.360 --> 10:29.692
we got ourselves the makings.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.127
Yes.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.772
Pixley's an unusual name.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.103
Did it, uh,
come from your mother?

10:42.174 --> 10:44.040
I'm pretty sure
it came from both my parents.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.578
What I meant was,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.511
was it your mother's
maiden name?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.014
No.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.072
It doesn't have
special significance?

10:51.150 --> 10:54.552
It has special significance
inasmuch as it's my name.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.054
Okay.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.321
How are you, uh,
enjoying your thing there?

11:00.393 --> 11:01.417
-- Fish?
-- Yeah.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.791
-- It's very good.
-- Good.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.656
And you should take your time
eating it, too.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.360
-- Do you have to get someplace?
-- No.

11:10.569 --> 11:12.799
I'm sorry.
Am I being boring?

11:12.872 --> 11:14.271
Absolutely not.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.331
Casey, if you want to go,
you can go.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.399
I don't want to go.

11:17.476 --> 11:18.773
Then why did you say that?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.211
Because I want you to savor
your fish.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.672
What's the problem?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.309
-- There is no problem.
-- I'm not your type.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.318
I really have no type.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.650
So we should stay on this date?

11:29.722 --> 11:32.657
I encourage you to order
a second helping of fish.

11:32.725 --> 11:33.954
So there's no problem.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.360
There is absolutely no problem.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.625
[Sighs]

11:41.500 --> 11:45.232
In a perfect world, I wouldn't be here
with you. I'd be here with someone else.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.772
[Fork clangs]

11:46.839 --> 11:48.398
I'm just telling you this
because I like you.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.441
-- You like me.
-- Yes.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.170
But not as much as the woman you would
be here with in a perfect world.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.508
-- VVell, yes, but that's a pretty
tough standard. -- How's that?

11:54.580 --> 11:56.446
-- Well, I'm in love with her.
-- You're in love with her.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.676
-- Dana.
-- Dana.

11:57.750 --> 11:58.239
Yeah.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.718
-- And you're out on a date with me.
-- Yes.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.881
There's a good explanation for that, which I
think is gonna make you feel a lot better.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.446
An explanation for why
you asked me on a date

12:05.524 --> 12:07.219
-- even though you're in love
with someone else? -- Yeah.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.783
-- And it's gonna make me feel better?
-- Oh, yeah.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.454
-- Give it a try.
-- She forced me.

12:10.529 --> 12:11.496
<i>Okay-duke .</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:12.895
Look, it's not as bad
as it sounds.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.330
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.892
Good night, Casey.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.104
[Sighs]

12:32.852 --> 12:34.786
Well, there's a coxswain
at Columbia.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.618
-- A coxswain?
-- Yes.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.851
The guy in the canoe who shouts?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.824
First of all, it's not a canoe,
it's a shell,

12:40.893 --> 12:42.657
and he doesn't just shout,
he also steers.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.958
Why do you have no respect
for water sports?

12:45.030 --> 12:46.122
A coxswain?

12:46.198 --> 12:47.893
They're competitors
like anyone else.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.128
I don't consider
what this guy does competing.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.226
Well, what do you consider it?

12:51.303 --> 12:52.737
I consider it
shouting out "faster"

12:52.805 --> 12:55.274
while eight preppy guys row
his lazy ass down the river.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.311
Well, perhaps if you took
the time to study the nuance --

12:58.377 --> 13:00.402
Did this guy do anything
spectacular?

13:00.479 --> 13:03.380
-- In a manner of speaking.
-- What did he do?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.213
He fell out of the boat.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.611
All right, put it down.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.121
-- Good.
-- How long do you think?

13:10.189 --> 13:11.020
A minute-30.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.683
I can stretch it.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.125
<i>Did this guy, by any chance,</i>

13:15.194 --> 13:17.856
save something that was drowning
on his way out of the boat?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.091
No.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.293
Just fell out, huh?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.699
Yep, and then he grabbed on
to the boat for support

13:23.769 --> 13:25.567
and knocked
most of his teammates out, too.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.402
The glory of sport.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.168
And then he almost got bit
by a turtle.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.402
Moving on.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.746
Isaac?

13:42.822 --> 13:43.789
What?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.517
You trying to sleep?

13:45.591 --> 13:48.026
You are on fire tonight, Jeremy.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.358
-- Where's your ride? -- Esthefls
staying fate at a benefit in <i>town.</i>

13:51.430 --> 13:53.330
They're dancing,
and she likes to dance.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.128
-- And she's late?
-- Yeah.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.169
Think you'll have to smack her
around when she gets here?

13:57.236 --> 13:58.567
What do you want?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.662
I wanted to tell you that I've
decided not to prepare a speech.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.434
-- Okay. No.
-- Want to know why?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.738
-- It's 'cause I don't think I should.
-- Mm. <i>Okay.</i>

14:04.810 --> 14:07.404
Do you know that in 1969,
an extra speech was written

14:07.479 --> 14:09.641
as <i>Apollo 11</i> was landing
on the moon?

14:09.715 --> 14:11.046
No.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.914
Did you know that in 1992,

14:12.985 --> 14:16.216
all three major presidential
candidates were lefties?

14:16.288 --> 14:17.949
-- I didn't know that.
-- Leave me alone.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.082
<i>They had a contingency speech
in case the LEM</i>

14:20.159 --> 14:21.991
was unable to lift off
the lunar surface,

14:22.061 --> 14:26.623
leaving the astronauts to die of starvation
and lack of oxygen on global television

14:26.699 --> 14:29.225
some 240,000 nautical miles
from home.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.235
Well, you don't want to
get caught unprepared.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.771
You also don't want to
tempt fate.

14:32.838 --> 14:35.500
I think it was bad karma
for them to prepare that speech.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.542
I feel the same way
about the award tomorrow night.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.079
-- <i>Son...</i>
-- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:40.145 --> 14:41.613
I'm sorry.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.149
You deserved to win
as much as anyone...

14:45.217 --> 14:46.776
...but you didn't.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.217
What do you mean?

14:48.287 --> 14:50.051
You didn't win.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.248
How do you know?

14:51.323 --> 14:53.189
Natalie knew, and she told me.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.353
-- Who won?
-- Sally Sasser.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.459
Oh. Okay.

14:58.530 --> 15:02.228
Well, okay.
I guess...never mind, then.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.791
Okay.

15:03.869 --> 15:04.893
Natalie knew?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.165
Yeah.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.364
Okay.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.373
-- <i>Jeremy?</i>
-- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

15:11.677 --> 15:12.974
You know what sucks?

15:13.045 --> 15:14.570
Losing an award?

15:15.648 --> 15:20.210
I was gonna say not being able
to dance with your wife.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.915
Yeah, I was gonna say that,
too, sir.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.924
Turn out the light, okay?

15:26.992 --> 15:28.426
Yeah.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.758
[Groans]

15:37.536 --> 15:40.471
All right, any new word
on Darren Hoho?

15:40.539 --> 15:41.938
-- Keehoe.
-- Is he the coxswain?

15:42.007 --> 15:43.771
-- He's the archer.
-- Any new <i>word?</i>

15:43.842 --> 15:45.310
He's still alive,
if that's what you're asking.

15:45.377 --> 15:47.038
-- Oh, man.
-- Dana!

15:47.112 --> 15:48.910
Hey, you think
there's any chance he was gay?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.676
-- Dana!
-- <i>It would make</i> a <i>better story.</i>

15:50.749 --> 15:53.184
-- He's on his deathbed. --
Natalie, I'm <i>about to</i> make this man

15:53.252 --> 15:55.949
the most famous 7th-place
archer in the history of sports.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.389
I think the very least he can do
is die in a timely manner...

15:59.458 --> 16:00.289
and be gay.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.155
Hi.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.284
<i>Any ideas?</i>

16:02.361 --> 16:04.921
Rerun tonight's show?

16:04.997 --> 16:06.055
Can I see you a second?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.496
Yeah.

16:17.009 --> 16:17.976
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.171
So I was working on my speech
with Isaac,

16:20.245 --> 16:21.940
and it turns out
he knows I didn't win.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.072
-- You know how he knows?
-- Jeremy --

16:23.148 --> 16:25.139
-- 'Cause you told him.
-- Yeah.

16:25.217 --> 16:26.548
Do you have any idea
how stupid I feel?

16:26.618 --> 16:28.677
-- I'm sorry. -- Why didn't
you tell me the truth?

16:28.754 --> 16:30.586
-- Why would I tell you?
-- What?

16:30.656 --> 16:31.623
Why would I tell you?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.419
-- Why would you tell me the truth?
-- Yeah.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.926
-- 'Cause it's the truth.
-- Yeah.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.520
The truth isn't this all-fired,
holy thing, you know.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.190
-- Natalie -- -- No, I think I'm
on pretty solid ground here.

16:40.265 --> 16:42.666
You were nominated for an award
and having a good time,

16:42.735 --> 16:45.363
and you had another 24 hours
of good time coming to you

16:45.437 --> 16:47.371
before you got boofed
by Sally Sasser.

16:47.439 --> 16:48.929
You can't tell me
you're better off knowing now

16:49.008 --> 16:52.376
than you would have been tomorrow
night when they opened the envelope.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.847
-- I'm searching for an ethical
leg to stand on. -- Yeah.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.849
Speaking of which,
I should mention

16:58.917 --> 17:01.511
that I'm very grateful
that I'm able to dance with you.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.112
You're not able to dance
with me.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.020
Yes, but if I could dance,
I could dance with you.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.558
I don't understand.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.260
I just generally feel stupid.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.594
Well, why don't we get
dressed up tomorrow night,

17:13.665 --> 17:17.157
go to the thing, celebrate the fact
that you got nominated at all,

17:17.236 --> 17:19.295
and then we'll go home
and see if I can't replace

17:19.371 --> 17:21.362
your feelings of stupidity
with something else.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.809
Natalie, you can't just always make
everything better by offering me sex.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.314
Well, yes, I guess you can.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.348
Where is she?

17:30.416 --> 17:31.941
What are you doing here?

17:32.017 --> 17:33.781
I want to talk to the house madam.
VVhere is she?

17:33.852 --> 17:36.287
Casey, I didn't win the award
I was nominated for,

17:36.355 --> 17:38.619
yet due to my love for Natalie
and my ability to dance,

17:38.690 --> 17:40.089
I don't feel so bad.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.491
-- What? -- Except I really,
really wanted to win.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.619
Where's Dana?

17:43.695 --> 17:44.685
Inside.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.561
Hey.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.226
What are you doing here?

17:49.301 --> 17:50.894
-- May I have a word?
-- Sure.

17:50.969 --> 17:51.993
Outside.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.436
Sure.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.238
-- Did Pixley stomp out?
-- She didn't stomp.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.537
-- <i>Were you mean to Pixley?</i>
-- No.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.008
-- <i>You were, weren't you?</i>
-- I <i>wasn't.</i>

17:59.078 --> 18:02.639
-- <i>I'm</i> going <i>to</i> call <i>her.</i>
-- <i>I wasn't mean to Pixley.</i>

18:02.714 --> 18:04.273
How did it go?

18:04.349 --> 18:06.511
I was totally mean to Pixley.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.381
Why?

18:07.453 --> 18:10.081
'Cause you're forcing me to do
something that is fundamentally mean.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.714
-- It is not mean.
-- Look, Dana, come on --

18:11.790 --> 18:13.451
Casey, you're
a handsome television star.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.324
I'm sure Pixley
had a very nice time.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.363
Oh, Pixley had a swell time

18:18.430 --> 18:19.829
right up until
the moment I told her

18:19.898 --> 18:21.161
the only reason I was there

18:21.233 --> 18:22.928
was that I had to go
on six-months worth of dates

18:23.001 --> 18:24.765
with other women
before you'd go outwith me.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.396
Well, why the hell
did you tell her that?

18:28.640 --> 18:29.698
What?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.573
Why did you tell her that?

18:31.643 --> 18:33.634
'Cause it seemed like
the right thing to do.

18:33.712 --> 18:34.941
-- Did it?
-- Yes.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.344
And in retrospect?

18:36.415 --> 18:37.712
-- Not so much.
-- Yeah.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.477
-- Look...
-- What?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.076
Dana, honesty --
that's what I'm about.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.882
Honesty and not rushing
through dinner.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.447
She stomped off, didn't she?

18:45.524 --> 18:46.548
Yes, she did.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.559
You got to do this
for real, Casey.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.028
-- That's the only way
it makes sense. -- No.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.860
No. There's really no way
this makes sense.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.229
-- You got to do it for real.
-- I <i>did</i> it for real.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.132
-- You took a dive.
-- But I was honest.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.227
You tanked it, Casey.
You phoned it in.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.705
I told her 'cause it was
the right thing to do.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.434
L-| liked her a lot.
I didn't want to make any --

19:03.509 --> 19:04.670
What?

19:04.743 --> 19:06.609
I told her 'cause it was
the right thing to do.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.645
You said you liked her.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.044
When?

19:09.114 --> 19:10.980
Just now.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.915
In fact, you said
you liked her a lot.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.518
Jealousy is rearing.

19:16.588 --> 19:17.783
Okay.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.348
<i>I am not jealous.</i>

19:20.425 --> 19:23.122
Rearing all...over the place.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.062
-- <i>Casey</i> -- -- By the way,
if I hadn't pulled the plug,

19:26.131 --> 19:28.099
I'd be over
at her place right now

19:28.167 --> 19:30.534
doing jello shots,
watching her please me.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.626
You're disgusting.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.536
She also said she was going to invite
over some of her stewardess friends.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.005
-- Get inside.
-- What are we doing?

19:36.074 --> 19:37.735
-- The show is short.
-- How short?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.004
42 minutes.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.739
-- <i>We only have 42 minutes?</i>
-- <i>We're short 42 minutes.</i>

19:41.813 --> 19:44.839
You know, a Columbia coxswain
fell out of his boat.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.716
-- Yeah, we factored that in.
-- Hmm.

19:47.786 --> 19:48.947
What's going on?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.422
-- <i>He's</i> still <i>alive.</i>
-- <i>I'm okay with that.</i>

19:51.490 --> 19:53.151
I think it's time for us all

19:53.225 --> 19:55.887
to take a deep breath
[Inhales] and relax

19:55.961 --> 19:59.625
and approach this with a sense
of calm professionalism.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.825
How could you lose
to Sally Sasser?

20:02.901 --> 20:04.801
-- <i>Sorry.</i>
-- <i>Here's something.</i>

20:04.870 --> 20:07.532
-- What? -- East bid 2
clubs, South bid 4 diamonds,

20:07.606 --> 20:09.700
and North came back
with a 5 no-trump.

20:09.775 --> 20:10.936
-- Bridge?
-- Yeah.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.568
Is there footage?

20:12.644 --> 20:15.079
<i>We're going to cover bridge?</i>

20:15.147 --> 20:17.639
-- It's the sport of kings. -- No. Once
again, it's not the sport of kings.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.206
Horse racing
is the sport of kings.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.615
-- Give me the dumplings.
-- What's bridge the sport of?

20:20.686 --> 20:22.950
-- Bridge isn't a sport.
-- Sure, it's a sport.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.115
No, I think at the very least,
people have to be moving.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.180
Kim.
