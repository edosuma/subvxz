WEBVTT

00:11.153 --> 00:15.271
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- I figured I'd stick around. So you got it.

00:15.353 --> 00:19.392
Just barely. The cops we were trying to nail,
they knew we were coming.

00:19.473 --> 00:22.829
- You all got out OK?
- Yeah, but everybody's really spooked.

00:22.913 --> 00:27.111
The S1W takes on police corruption.
You didn't think it was gonna be easy?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.866
Just get Eyes Only
to do the broadcast tonight.

00:29.953 --> 00:34.868
I need something on record, otherwise
the cops can make us out to be the bad guys.

00:34.953 --> 00:37.626
- You got it.
- Thanks.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.948
- You OK?
- Yeah. I don't know.

00:43.033 --> 00:46.708
Logan, I'm telling you something,
somebody's onto us.

01:11.633 --> 01:14.864
Officials hail Anselmo
as a courageous individual

01:14.953 --> 01:18.628
who paid the ultimate sacrifice
in pursuit of higher justice.

01:20.513 --> 01:24.472
Do not attempt to adjust your set.

01:24.553 --> 01:29.946
This cable hack will last exactly 60 seconds.
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped.

01:30.033 --> 01:33.105
And it is the only free voice left in this city.

01:33.193 --> 01:37.903
Activist group the S1W has again
been busy in defence of your freedom,

01:37.993 --> 01:40.382
securing indisputable physical evidence

01:40.473 --> 01:44.102
of wholesale corruption
in the sector police force.

01:49.913 --> 01:52.950
How many times
have you played this before?

01:53.033 --> 01:54.227
Never.

01:56.753 --> 01:58.823
You might wanna move.

02:04.433 --> 02:06.788
Move!

02:13.993 --> 02:17.269
Get down! Everybody down!
Freeze! Stop right there!

02:23.713 --> 02:26.147
All right!

02:31.993 --> 02:34.427
God, man, that bullet. How'd you know?

02:40.153 --> 02:43.987
He needs a doctor. He needs a doctor!

02:51.273 --> 02:53.264
That's all of 'em!

03:19.353 --> 03:24.143
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.189
Then she escaped.

03:26.273 --> 03:30.585
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:30.673 --> 03:33.062
she is haunted by her past.

03:33.153 --> 03:39.069
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:13.273 --> 04:17.630
Last night here in Sector Four,
an anonymous tip led police to this building,

04:17.713 --> 04:22.867
headquarters of dissident group S1W,
and the arrest of at least six members.

04:22.953 --> 04:26.423
You hearing this, people? Anonymous tips.

04:26.513 --> 04:29.107
That's how we get
these outlaws off the street.

04:29.193 --> 04:33.391
- They're not outlaws.
- Yeah? Says who?

04:33.473 --> 04:36.146
They're just trying to expose
corrupt sector cops.

04:36.233 --> 04:41.307
Interesting theory, Miss Late As Usual.
How'd you get to be an expert on the S1W?

04:49.193 --> 04:51.627
So what do you know about the S1W?

04:51.713 --> 04:54.307
Why? You thinking of phoning me in?

05:02.353 --> 05:06.346
- So what's up with our little Maxie here?
- What do you mean?

05:06.433 --> 05:10.824
Maybe we got ourselves an S1W type
right underneath our noses.

05:10.913 --> 05:14.872
- She fits the profile.
- Yeah, I heard. What do I do?

05:14.953 --> 05:21.267
Zero respect for authority, erratic behaviour,
lots of unexplained absences...

05:21.353 --> 05:22.627
OK, I'll go get it.

05:22.713 --> 05:26.991
Plus I think she's got
a lot of underlying hostility.

05:30.113 --> 05:34.948
- What are you two looking at?
- Nothing. I just got a delivery here for Alec.

05:35.033 --> 05:38.742
What do you know? It's right near
where the S1W was arrested.

05:39.993 --> 05:41.984
I'll take that.

05:42.393 --> 05:44.384
What did I tell you?

06:14.793 --> 06:17.307
Mikey! Check me out, man. I'm winning.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.741
- What are you doing here?
- Right back at ya.

06:39.833 --> 06:44.031
- I'm looking for something.
- Asha's address book? Yeah. Me, too.

06:45.713 --> 06:49.706
Don't act like it's some big secret.
Asha's in the S1W. They got arrested here.

06:49.793 --> 06:52.148
- What's it got to do with you?
- My number's in it.

06:52.233 --> 06:55.942
- You and the S1W, fighting the power.
- Who said anything about the S1W?

06:56.033 --> 06:58.706
Asha asked for my number
one night at Crash.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.388
- She asked?
- Or maybe I offered it to her.

07:03.513 --> 07:06.550
It was during that mermaid thing.
I was feeling lonely.

07:06.633 --> 07:10.023
Consider your lonely ass saved.
Here's her backpack.

07:17.793 --> 07:21.581
Have you ever pretended to write down
a guy's phone number?

07:23.993 --> 07:27.668
What's this? Asha likes poetry?

07:27.753 --> 07:29.744
It's none of your business.

07:33.793 --> 07:38.389
Get a load of this. "Love, let me
raise you softer than moonbeams."

07:38.473 --> 07:42.352
- Makes you wonder who she's writing to.
- Could be anyone.

07:45.033 --> 07:50.107
It could be about anyone, but here's an
interesting fact: Logan's name is in her book.

07:50.193 --> 07:52.627
- They work together.
- I'm sure they do.

07:52.713 --> 07:55.432
- That's why I'm here.
- Because they work together?

07:55.513 --> 07:58.744
- I don't want Logan's name in a police file.
- With Asha's.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.824
- With the S1W.
- OK, right.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.542
- Now, Logan used to be your thing.
- We weren't even like that.

08:04.633 --> 08:10.390
So when Logan asks you to get his poetess
friend Asha outta jail, you jump at the cha...

08:10.993 --> 08:15.589
- We weren't designed to be chumps, Max.
- People were arrested here last night.

08:15.673 --> 08:19.302
They risked their lives for something
more important than themselves.

08:19.393 --> 08:23.181
They were rounded up because some snitch
turned them in. One guy was wounded.

08:23.273 --> 08:27.664
Forget the cheap shots. Even if that were true,
it wouldn't matter. It's not about me.

08:27.753 --> 08:29.106
- Max.
- What?

08:33.913 --> 08:36.107
Or maybe it is about you.

08:55.353 --> 08:57.389
Neighbour.

08:57.473 --> 09:01.910
I'm kind of expecting someone at 7.03.

09:01.993 --> 09:04.791
So I'll be away two days at least.

09:04.873 --> 09:07.467
So I was wondering,
if it's not too much trouble,

09:07.553 --> 09:12.468
if maybe you could
get my mail while I'm gone?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.430
Neighbour?

09:14.513 --> 09:17.107
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

09:26.553 --> 09:32.185
You know, I can't actually remember what
he looked like. You kind of don't notice him.

09:33.593 --> 09:36.312
- You don't notice him?
- It's hard to explain.

09:38.193 --> 09:41.742
- He's got game.
- Yeah, and he was barely trying.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.393
He was just... I don't know.

09:43.393 --> 09:44.303
He was just... I don't know.

09:44.393 --> 09:48.227
- It's like he sees everything.
- What do you mean, "sees everything"?

09:48.313 --> 09:54.502
This'll sound crazy, but it's like he knows
what's gonna happen before it happens.

09:54.593 --> 09:58.586
- Yeah, that sounds crazy.
- He knew that raid was coming.

09:58.673 --> 10:01.426
And you see that bullet hole over there?

10:01.513 --> 10:05.028
He ducked before the shot was fired.
Made me duck, too.

10:05.113 --> 10:09.186
The bullet went right over our heads.
He saved my life.

10:09.273 --> 10:11.468
Do you know how to find this guy?

10:11.553 --> 10:15.512
- Max. Is that Brian?
- Looks like Brain.

10:15.593 --> 10:18.107
113, 125th Place.

10:18.193 --> 10:23.392
Just like he said. He said the hottest chick
I'd ever seen would show up looking for him.

10:23.473 --> 10:25.429
I guess that's you.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.346
Shut up.

11:04.593 --> 11:09.064
Nature's miracle, that's what it is,
white and hearty and true.

11:09.153 --> 11:12.668
Not ostrich or emu or goose,
it's straight from the chicken to you.

11:12.753 --> 11:17.827
So if you wanna feel healthy, here's what
you'll do: Break an egg. That means you.

11:25.553 --> 11:28.067
Break an egg. OK.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.908
Keep your voice down. Don't knock either.

11:44.993 --> 11:47.302
- Why?
- You lose the element of surprise.

11:47.393 --> 11:50.510
- What surprise? He's expecting us.
- It could be a trap.

11:50.593 --> 11:52.629
- I think we can handle him.
- "We"?

11:52.713 --> 11:55.625
No one asked you to tag along.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.624
That's right.

11:58.913 --> 12:01.427
You were supposed to come alone.

12:07.273 --> 12:10.583
OK, this is totally unnecessary.

12:10.673 --> 12:13.062
- This is the guy who turned them in?
- Looks like.

12:13.153 --> 12:15.713
He admits he knew the raid was going down.

12:15.793 --> 12:19.263
Although, according to him,
only to a 73% certainty.

12:19.353 --> 12:22.663
Hello. OK, these things are a little tight.

12:22.753 --> 12:25.950
I don't know if I mentioned it
but I bruise easily.

12:26.033 --> 12:29.343
Look, I'm trying to help you, Max.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.869
- Do you know him?
- I think he's got a little thing for Max.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.751
We'll deal with him and his little thing later.

12:35.833 --> 12:40.907
They're moving the S1W in an hour.
There's a chance to intercept on Highway 153.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.871
That's a bad idea.

12:43.953 --> 12:49.353
There's a railroad crossing in disrepair along
the route. It's a mile from the poultry farm.

12:49.473 --> 12:52.545
If you're thinking about the train track,
think again.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.591
- What is this?
- It's 92% failure scenarios.

12:55.673 --> 12:58.062
OK, I need you to shut up.

12:58.153 --> 13:02.829
County roads in the area allow unacceptable
delivery rates of backup sector personnel.

13:02.913 --> 13:07.429
The probabilities of
subsequent apprehension is like...

13:08.473 --> 13:13.831
3157 Mercer Street? Is this your idea
of a secret meeting place?

13:13.913 --> 13:16.302
- "I will love you like the..."
- Hey!

13:19.593 --> 13:22.630
- What are you doing?
- Eyes Only?

13:26.753 --> 13:28.152
I just wanna read it.

13:28.233 --> 13:32.306
The crossing'll be deserted.
The bus'll stop. It'll be easy. What's that?

13:32.393 --> 13:33.872
- Nothing.
- Poetry.

13:33.953 --> 13:37.662
It's nothing. Stay with what's-his-name
and we'll do the rest.

13:37.753 --> 13:38.742
What is his name?

13:38.833 --> 13:40.824
- Brain.
- Brian.

13:42.153 --> 13:45.065
- Be careful.
- "Be careful." That cost him.

13:45.153 --> 13:47.223
- I can do this alone.
- I'm on board.

13:47.313 --> 13:53.468
The only way it'll work is if you break an egg!
You hear me, Max? Break an egg!

14:18.473 --> 14:20.509
Well, well.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.023
- Max.
- Got your back.

14:41.033 --> 14:45.709
- Max, it's a silent alarm.
- The keys. Find the keys.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.508
Alec?

14:51.593 --> 14:53.390
Drive. Drive!

14:59.913 --> 15:02.871
- The fat kid may have been right.
- We'll make it.

15:07.393 --> 15:10.513
I'm glad to hear that. We're being followed.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.951
- We're all clear ahead.
- Yeah, except for the police cruisers.

15:22.553 --> 15:25.829
- Just find the key.
- Only 150 more to go.

15:38.033 --> 15:40.501
- What did Brain say before we left?
- Bad plan.

15:40.593 --> 15:44.347
- I mean, as we were leaving.
- Break a leg.

15:46.353 --> 15:50.426
- He said egg. Break an egg.
- It doesn't matter what he said.

15:52.833 --> 15:55.427
Hold on. Everyone hold on!

15:55.513 --> 15:57.151
No, Max, no!

16:34.033 --> 16:35.830
- He needs help.
- I'm OK.

16:35.913 --> 16:39.588
- How'd it go, Max?
- Kind of weird, actually. Hold on.

16:40.713 --> 16:42.908
- How'd you know?
- Know what?

16:42.993 --> 16:44.790
- Break an egg.
- The cops, the train.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.704
- Did I get the schedule wrong?
- No.

16:46.793 --> 16:49.785
- Then what are you mad about?
- Tell us how you knew.

16:49.873 --> 16:54.628
How do you think I knew?
I'm an X-series, just like you.

16:59.553 --> 17:01.589
- What are you?
- What am I?

17:01.673 --> 17:05.984
- You don't exactly look like a soldier.
- And you two do?

17:06.073 --> 17:09.667
I'm an IT Concentrate. A battle processor.

17:09.752 --> 17:13.587
I'm basically a general,
his staff, two database groups,

17:13.673 --> 17:18.109
and five logistical support teams,
all rolled into one stealth package.

17:18.913 --> 17:23.304
- "Stealth." Yeah.
- People look away.

17:23.393 --> 17:27.271
They don't remember me.
There, are you happy?

17:27.353 --> 17:31.505
- That doesn't explain your psychic ability.
- Psychic? Please.

17:31.593 --> 17:36.826
I combine near-absolute data knowledge
with fast neural nets for heuristics.

17:36.913 --> 17:37.902
Heuristics?

17:37.993 --> 17:40.905
Predictions using probability
algorithms stored in my...

17:40.993 --> 17:45.623
- Are you sure you wanna hear this?
- Whatever you call it, you can tell the future.

17:45.713 --> 17:49.103
I can see our future. Yours and mine.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.348
That's why I'm here, Max.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.346
Get the feeling he's got something else
on his mind other than betraying the S1W?

17:57.433 --> 18:02.712
But I didn't betray the S1W.
It was one of them.

18:08.833 --> 18:09.822
Come on.

18:09.913 --> 18:12.825
- I don't wanna get outta town.
- You don't have a choice.

18:12.913 --> 18:15.473
They have photos of you now. Fingerprints.

18:15.553 --> 18:19.068
It's just a matter of time
before they pick you up again.

18:19.153 --> 18:22.111
- This yours?
- Thanks.

18:22.193 --> 18:28.189
There's personal stuff in there you might
wanna keep track of. Address book, poems.

18:30.873 --> 18:32.670
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

18:32.753 --> 18:37.065
- S1W went down cos of him.
- Or not. That's what I'm thinking.

18:37.153 --> 18:39.713
Don't worry. I'll keep him on a short leash.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.784
It was nice seeing you again.

18:44.633 --> 18:48.069
You're right about the S1W.
One of them's a police informant.

18:48.153 --> 18:52.988
They free political prisoners, play
Robin Hood, and the cops leave them alone.

18:53.073 --> 18:56.861
Then they attack police corruption
head-on and get nailed.

18:58.753 --> 19:00.584
- Pay attention.
- I am.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.584
What did I just say?

19:02.673 --> 19:04.664
You were wondering what, if anything,

19:04.753 --> 19:05.633
is going on between
blondie and you know who.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.988
Is going on between
blondie and you know who.

19:14.353 --> 19:18.107
- Let's stick with who's the informant.
- I don't know who.

19:18.193 --> 19:22.948
I pulled up the arrest reports from
the police databases, so just do your thing.

19:23.673 --> 19:27.268
OK, that's the guy that got shot,
so we know it's not him.

19:27.353 --> 19:32.746
Unless that's what
we're supposed to think and it is him.

19:34.313 --> 19:38.226
On this next one, could you be a little more,
what was it, heuristic?

19:40.273 --> 19:43.982
Yeah, she's gonna be a lot heavier
than I am when she's 30.

19:44.073 --> 19:48.510
- 93% certainty.
- Did she turn them in?

19:48.593 --> 19:50.584
- No idea.
- OK, then.

19:51.673 --> 19:54.392
This guy. What about him?

19:56.233 --> 19:59.225
I don't know who he is.
Max went to get your address book

19:59.313 --> 20:02.783
and came back with some crazy guy
who knows a lot about the S1W.

20:02.873 --> 20:06.627
- Not a lot. Everything.
- Max seems to think he's OK.

20:06.713 --> 20:09.307
Yeah, well, Max wasn't turned in, was she?

20:11.313 --> 20:16.148
- What you're saying is none of 'em did it?
- Maybe all of them did it.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.303
Or maybe not.

20:18.393 --> 20:22.102
- Look, I'm not optimised for this.
- It's OK.

20:22.673 --> 20:26.666
We're finally together
and I'm letting you down.

20:28.313 --> 20:31.305
You don't remember me at all, do you?

20:31.393 --> 20:33.782
From back at Manticore?

20:35.393 --> 20:39.022
That's all right. I'm designed to be forgettable.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.310
But I remember you,
with your short hair and your cammies,

20:42.393 --> 20:46.545
and you could blur and everything.

20:46.633 --> 20:51.388
I used to watch you and your friends
running around just having a blast.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.626
It was no blast, believe me.

20:56.993 --> 21:00.353
When you broke out,
leaving the rest of us behind,

21:00.553 --> 21:04.068
I thought I was gonna die,
I missed you so much.

21:06.073 --> 21:08.792
Look, Brain, we didn't know each other.

21:08.873 --> 21:15.142
I knew you. They fed us data
on all the X-5s to predict battle behaviour.

21:15.233 --> 21:20.626
And I stayed after every day, learning
everything there was to know about you.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.147
I knew you.

21:23.233 --> 21:25.667
That data they fed you, it wasn't me.

21:27.713 --> 21:30.705
I knew you'd come back to Manticore.
And you did.

21:30.793 --> 21:35.469
I knew you'd get involved
the second S1W got into trouble.

21:35.553 --> 21:39.910
- That's why I'm here.
- What do you mean, that's why you're here?

21:39.993 --> 21:43.383
I know you better than anyone, Max.

21:44.233 --> 21:47.191
And I would do anything for you.

21:51.833 --> 21:57.544
What I really need you to do
is tell me who the informant is, OK?

21:58.233 --> 21:59.632
What?

22:02.233 --> 22:08.945
There was a 0.05% chance that you were
gonna lean over and kiss me right then.

22:10.073 --> 22:12.462
I was just hoping.

22:16.873 --> 22:19.865
- OK.
- Let's go.

22:22.073 --> 22:24.541
If she's on our side,
why's she protecting him?

22:24.633 --> 22:27.067
- She's not protecting him.
- Then where is he?

22:27.153 --> 22:30.145
Why don't we concentrate
on getting you guys outta town?

22:30.233 --> 22:33.782
Why don't you call me when you get there?
You've got my number.

22:33.873 --> 22:37.707
- Who's he working for?
- He's not working for anyone.

22:37.793 --> 22:41.149
- He saved your asses.
- Is that what he says?

22:41.233 --> 22:44.703
That's what I say.
You're blaming the wrong guy.

22:44.793 --> 22:48.627
I think sector police will approach
in a scatter Y formation,

22:48.713 --> 22:51.625
Alpha Team in the stairwell,
Bravo in the elevator.

22:51.713 --> 22:53.943
A third team will stake out the roof.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.388
- What is he talking about?
- Shut up!

22:56.473 --> 22:59.624
Egress through a fire stairwell,
54 steps to the second floor.

22:59.713 --> 23:03.991
There's a fan behind a grate in the hallway.
Use it. It's your only way out.

23:04.073 --> 23:05.301
- When?
- Now!

23:05.393 --> 23:08.510
Go! Do what he says! Get out of here!

23:08.593 --> 23:11.061
You trust him, you lead the way.

23:28.553 --> 23:31.386
I got one! I think.

24:02.193 --> 24:04.343
- Yeah?
- We're at the pick-up point.

24:04.433 --> 24:07.345
- How you doing?
- I'm off to the frozen north.

24:07.433 --> 24:10.231
I don't know who to trust.
I'm not happy about this.

24:10.313 --> 24:13.271
Well, I'm not happy about it either.

24:13.353 --> 24:16.151
If you two aren't happy, I'm not happy.
Max, are you happy?

24:16.233 --> 24:17.871
Shut up!

24:18.713 --> 24:22.308
No, not you. There should be
a loading ramp by the garage.

24:22.393 --> 24:23.189
OK.

24:23.273 --> 24:26.310
A truck will back in at 4.05.
That's your ride to Canada.

24:26.393 --> 24:30.671
The driver's a friend of Eyes Only.
He knows the entire situation.

24:31.913 --> 24:36.304
Detective Sung said Brain's in lockdown
at 12th precinct. I'm gonna get him.

24:36.393 --> 24:41.831
Hear that? The big guy's in lockdown, so
it's hard to figure him for a police informant.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.871
So until we know who is... be careful.

24:46.353 --> 24:50.904
- Keep your departure plans to yourself.
- Logan, don't hang up yet.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.624
It's just...

24:55.393 --> 25:00.069
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here. You're gonna be fine.

25:01.113 --> 25:04.025
Good luck. Just stay in touch.

25:10.433 --> 25:10.713
What in the world do they see in you?

25:10.713 --> 25:13.022
What in the world do they see in you?

25:23.993 --> 25:25.267
It's you.

25:25.353 --> 25:28.504
Spare me. You knew I'd be coming for you.

25:28.593 --> 25:31.232
You must have been expecting someone.

25:31.313 --> 25:34.862
Or did you think you could
really slip through those bars?

25:34.953 --> 25:37.148
- That's hurtful.
- Let's get going.

25:37.233 --> 25:40.987
The guard I stole this uniform off of
won't be out for ever.

25:43.513 --> 25:45.549
What's with the ankle?

25:59.913 --> 26:04.828
While the cops were storming the place
and you guys were all getting away,

26:04.913 --> 26:06.904
I had this thought.

26:07.713 --> 26:09.704
Left.

26:14.193 --> 26:18.152
Maybe people don't see me
because there's nothing to see.

26:18.233 --> 26:20.952
Are you sure this is the fastest way out?

26:21.033 --> 26:25.106
What's the point of knowing everything
but doing nothing about it?

26:25.193 --> 26:28.390
I'm not seeing an exit anywhere soon.

26:36.193 --> 26:39.424
Anyways, that's why I turned myself in.

26:39.513 --> 26:43.791
You what? I'm dying because
you turned yourself in on purpose?

26:43.873 --> 26:46.592
I thought you were supposed to be strong.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.426
I'm not Superwoman.

26:49.513 --> 26:51.583
Here.

26:53.393 --> 26:55.987
Hurry. Right there.

26:56.913 --> 26:59.268
They're coming.

26:59.353 --> 27:01.344
Gently, gently. OK.

27:16.273 --> 27:20.027
- Do you know what the chance of this is?
- Of you turning yourself in?

27:20.113 --> 27:22.707
No. Of you and me, here together

27:22.793 --> 27:26.468
in this exact precinct, in this exact office,

27:26.553 --> 27:29.625
you wearing that uniform,
me and my sprained ankle,

27:29.713 --> 27:32.181
in this exact moment in space and time?

27:32.273 --> 27:34.912
Do you know what the chance is?

27:34.993 --> 27:39.623
- Who knows? One in a trillion?
- No. It's 100%.

27:39.713 --> 27:41.704
We're here, right?

27:44.033 --> 27:48.390
- OK. I see where all this is going now.
- Where? Where's it going?

27:48.473 --> 27:51.704
You mean where are you going?
Because you're running.

27:51.793 --> 27:57.425
Running through a passageway,
drawn onward by distant voices.

27:57.513 --> 28:00.471
There's machinery. Steam.

28:00.553 --> 28:04.102
It's some kind of factory. No, it's a sawmill.

28:05.713 --> 28:08.705
- What?
- You look so beautiful when you run.

28:09.913 --> 28:13.872
What are the voices? You said
"drawn onward by distant voices."

28:13.953 --> 28:16.990
- I said that? "Drawn onward"?
- That's what you said.

28:17.073 --> 28:21.828
Well, OK, then.
You're drawn onward by distant voices.

28:26.113 --> 28:31.710
Voices of the S1W being held captive
by the traitor in their midst.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.149
OK, you descend a staircase,

28:35.233 --> 28:38.942
into another passageway,
headed for a door at the end.

28:39.033 --> 28:41.228
There's a sign on the door.

28:42.113 --> 28:44.104
It says...

28:45.553 --> 28:47.305
What? What does it say?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.588
"Drawn onward." I really said that?

28:49.673 --> 28:51.948
What's the sign say?

28:53.473 --> 28:55.589
OK.

28:55.673 --> 28:59.746
The sign. It says "danger".

29:01.073 --> 29:03.906
But because you're you, you don't stop.

29:04.793 --> 29:08.183
Instead, you kick the door open...

29:15.393 --> 29:17.588
What? What happened?

29:19.633 --> 29:22.591
- I don't know. Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

29:22.673 --> 29:25.631
I mean, why did I take so long to find you?

29:26.313 --> 29:30.750
I don't buy any of it. Why am I supposed
to believe you just happen to know all this?

29:30.833 --> 29:33.825
How could anyone
just happen to know all this?

29:35.633 --> 29:37.863
Why do you think we're here?

29:45.593 --> 29:49.825
- That's just like Asha's book.
- It's an old CIA trick.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.752
- A poem?
- Not a poem.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.428
A coded message, keyed to matching books.

29:55.513 --> 29:59.665
That's how the informant's
been communicating with the cops.

29:59.753 --> 30:01.983
What are you saying? Asha's a traitor?

30:02.073 --> 30:07.067
Look at the bright side. At least
she's not writing love poems to Logan.

30:09.873 --> 30:12.148
No, it doesn't make any sense.

30:12.233 --> 30:15.191
Betraying the S1W would hurt Logan.

30:15.273 --> 30:18.106
- She wouldn't do that.
- Good point.

30:18.193 --> 30:20.707
It must have been
someone else's book you found.

30:20.793 --> 30:22.784
Whose?

30:23.633 --> 30:25.544
Beats me.

30:38.673 --> 30:42.712
- You took my book.
- No, it ended up in my backpack somehow.

30:42.793 --> 30:45.591
Lucky for me. I was afraid I'd lost it.

31:01.873 --> 31:05.752
- What does it say?
- "Love, softness swelling..."

31:05.833 --> 31:07.903
I mean decoded!

31:10.113 --> 31:13.469
The traitor's the group leader,
the guy who got shot.

31:13.553 --> 31:16.829
- He's dangerous, Max, so...
- I know - be careful.

31:16.913 --> 31:20.428
I was gonna say let's turn around
and forget the whole thing.

31:20.513 --> 31:21.513
We could live happily ever after.
That's 97% certain.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.142
We could live happily ever after.
That's 97% certain.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.107
- Brain?
- Yeah?

31:28.193 --> 31:30.787
- Watch the hands!
- I'm just trying to hang on!

31:30.873 --> 31:32.909
Hang on a little lower!

31:34.313 --> 31:36.065
Not that low.

31:44.393 --> 31:47.305
- It's 4.05. Time to move.
- Where?

31:47.393 --> 31:49.827
We've got a ride to Canada.

31:51.233 --> 31:53.224
Let's go, then.

32:05.593 --> 32:07.584
- Wish me luck.
- Max, wait.

32:09.913 --> 32:12.268
The poem you found in Asha's backpack...

32:12.353 --> 32:15.151
- You mean the coded message.
- Yeah.

32:15.233 --> 32:18.066
Only you didn't know that at the time.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.144
And you helped her anyway.

32:22.993 --> 32:25.109
- How do I look?
- What do you mean?

32:25.193 --> 32:25.873
How do I look?

32:25.873 --> 32:27.591
How do I look?

32:28.633 --> 32:33.423
Is there something you're not telling me?
Something that's gonna happen?

32:35.953 --> 32:38.148
Well...

32:38.233 --> 32:42.146
I never actually noticed before, but...

32:42.233 --> 32:44.030
kind of...

32:48.313 --> 32:50.543
magnificent.

33:13.393 --> 33:16.624
- Fall back!
- Freeze! Stay where you are!

33:54.353 --> 33:56.105
- This way.
- Where are we going?

33:56.193 --> 33:58.468
- This way.
- The gunfire's stopped.

33:58.553 --> 34:00.191
- More's coming.
- How do you know?

34:00.273 --> 34:02.628
Just go!

34:04.033 --> 34:06.024
Let's go! Let's go!

34:13.513 --> 34:15.902
Team two, take the far door!

35:14.153 --> 35:16.713
Come on, let's go! Move, move!

35:20.673 --> 35:23.107
Hey, come on. Let us out!

35:40.753 --> 35:43.273
Because you're running. Running through a
passageway, drawn onward by distant voices.

35:43.273 --> 35:45.787
Because you're running. Running through a
passageway, drawn onward by distant voices.

35:46.833 --> 35:51.861
Voices of the S1W being held captive
by the traitor in their midst.

36:34.033 --> 36:37.389
You descend a staircase
into another passageway,

36:37.473 --> 36:39.623
headed for a door at the end.

36:39.713 --> 36:44.662
There's a sign on the door. It says danger.

37:09.233 --> 37:11.224
Brain.

37:13.713 --> 37:16.102
You'll be all right.

37:29.153 --> 37:29.433
Egress through that door.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.264
Egress through that door.

37:31.873 --> 37:34.148
93 feet. Turn right.

37:35.433 --> 37:37.151
Hurry.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.550
Let's go.

37:46.673 --> 37:50.109
- You saw this, didn't you?
- I saw you.

37:51.273 --> 37:53.184
You saved me.

37:54.273 --> 37:57.822
What are the chances? You, me?

37:59.353 --> 38:02.106
100%.

38:02.193 --> 38:06.584
Max... I don't mind if no one else ever saw me.

38:09.073 --> 38:11.064
I just wanted to be seen by you.

38:24.873 --> 38:27.262
Clear that area!

38:29.353 --> 38:31.344
Clear!

38:38.393 --> 38:40.429
Brain.

38:45.233 --> 38:47.224
Brain?

39:06.313 --> 39:09.191
I got your message. Is it true?

39:10.153 --> 39:15.102
Yeah, it's true.
All the police files from the arrest are gone.

39:15.193 --> 39:17.468
- Your record's clean.
- So I can stay?

39:17.553 --> 39:20.545
- You all can.
- God, Logan, thanks.

39:21.873 --> 39:23.147
Don't thank me.

39:23.233 --> 39:29.468
Apparently, a candy bar melted on the
precinct system server, ruined all the data.

39:29.553 --> 39:34.149
- Wow. What are the chances of that?
- According to Max, they're...

39:34.233 --> 39:37.828
- What?
- Better than you'd think.

39:38.433 --> 39:41.948
So you wanna come along?
Tell the group the good news?

39:42.033 --> 39:47.266
I promised someone I'd do them a favour.
How about if I meet you guys there later?

39:48.633 --> 39:52.262
Tell Max I'm sorry, OK? About her friend.

39:53.313 --> 39:55.304
OK.

40:15.913 --> 40:19.462
Where shall I see you? Where will you go?

40:20.513 --> 40:23.346
I'll meet you at the manor
after I've seen Frank.

40:23.433 --> 40:25.708
- Take care of yourself, darling.
- I will.

40:25.793 --> 40:31.743
It's bright and warm outside,
thank goodness. I'll be all right.

40:31.833 --> 40:36.588
Do not attempt to adjust your set.
This is a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

40:36.673 --> 40:39.949
It will last 60 seconds.
It cannot be traced or stopped.

40:40.033 --> 40:44.106
I don't know how he stood it.
All that noise, I mean.

40:44.193 --> 40:46.627
All around us, a battle wages...

40:46.713 --> 40:49.307
Why are you here?

40:49.393 --> 40:51.668
Never a welcoming word with you, is there?

40:51.753 --> 40:53.027
Well?

40:56.313 --> 40:58.543
Maybe...

40:58.633 --> 41:00.749
Maybe I wanted to make sure you're OK.

41:00.833 --> 41:05.588
The courageous among us are called
more often than others to sacrifice.

41:05.673 --> 41:08.665
A great and fearless warrior
in this battle died today...

41:08.753 --> 41:12.826
- "Great and fearless warrior"?
- It doesn't matter what they say.

41:12.913 --> 41:15.347
I just want people to see him.

41:15.433 --> 41:18.869
Overlooked in his lifetime by all of us...

41:18.953 --> 41:21.148
- Why are you here?
- Like I said...

41:21.233 --> 41:23.747
You sold his TVs, didn't you?

41:23.833 --> 41:26.984
Not all of them.
I'm gonna keep one for myself.

41:27.073 --> 41:31.828
- You're moving in?
- It's not like he needs the place any more.

41:41.793 --> 41:47.709
You know, I never really noticed,
but he's actually kind of magnificent.

41:56.993 --> 42:00.827
Yeah. He was.

42:22.313 --> 42:25.225
