WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.752
I cannot believe this is
happening to me again.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.876
But this time, dear D'Argo,
it is by your own choice.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.082
Barely.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.919
The approaching Marauder's
ident signal

00:12.013 --> 00:15.221
says it's definitely not from
Crais's Command Carrier.

00:15.308 --> 00:18.846
There are other ways to deal
with the Peacekeepers.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.313
Let's try Crichton's way.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.318
Crichton's way.

00:26.402 --> 00:32.193
If we are going to attempt
this, Rygel, it means
no Thronesled.

00:51.928 --> 00:54.465
( beeps )
We are ready now, Pilot.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.216
Understood.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.394
( beeps )

01:24.961 --> 01:27.202
Aeryn:
Identify yourself.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.461
Regiment, assignment?

01:36.305 --> 01:39.263
Identify yourself.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.801
Lieutenant Aeryn Sun.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.012
Ustar Regiment, special
duty assignment.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.893
And you?

01:47.984 --> 01:49.315
Larraq. Captain.

01:49.402 --> 01:52.018
And my assignment's
none of your business.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.276
Having some trouble with
your Marauder, Captain?

01:56.367 --> 01:58.278
Cesium fuel leak.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.700
We're lucky we found you.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.288
You think?

02:01.372 --> 02:04.455
Awful big ship for
one little girl.

02:04.542 --> 02:08.376
Oh, I can handle big.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.719
Ease your weapon, Lieutenant.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.442
That is an order.

02:41.412 --> 02:45.030
Smart move... Captain.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.665
What are you doing aboard
my vessel, Captain?

02:51.756 --> 02:54.042
Emergency situation.

02:54.133 --> 02:58.342
My team and l are on a
priority red-one mission.

02:58.429 --> 03:01.341
We need your boat here
to complete it.

03:01.432 --> 03:04.174
Therefore, under article
4-1-4 Decca,

03:04.268 --> 03:08.261
I hereby assume command over
it, your crew...

03:13.611 --> 03:15.351
and you.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.691
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:21.786 --> 03:24.778
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:24.872 --> 03:27.830
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe
on a ship...

03:27.917 --> 03:31.205
A living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:31.295 --> 03:32.330
Help me...

03:32.421 --> 03:33.627
Listen, please.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.625
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:35.716 --> 03:39.959
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:40.054 --> 03:42.215
...doing everything I can...

03:42.306 --> 03:44.797
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.202
Oh, I think not.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.304
Peacekeepeh
What the frell?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.016
You need my help.

04:34.900 --> 04:39.360
| suggest you ask
nicely, Captain.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.497
Aeryn:
A Delvian.

04:53.586 --> 04:56.328
And a quite attractive one.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.549
(low growling)

05:05.639 --> 05:10.599
Larraq:
So, you recaptured them, out
here on a New Technologies training flight?

05:10.686 --> 05:16.056
U-Tech has been experimenting
with Leviathan mastery without
the use of control collars.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.275
How are you controlling the
ship without a collar?

05:20.362 --> 05:24.605
Neural control on the ship's
Pilot. We control him, he
controls the ship.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.112
Yes, I heard they'd been
working on that.

05:27.203 --> 05:31.867
But every test flight so far,
they've lost the Leviathan
and the crew.

05:31.957 --> 05:36.826
Well, so far, this test flight
has gone without a hitch.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.082
Till you came aboard, Captain.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.664
Tell me, what precisely
is your mission?

05:41.759 --> 05:44.796
You don't have the clearance to
know anything my mission,
Captain.

05:44.887 --> 05:48.880
-Oh.
-But let me make it
simple for you.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.555
I've got one crate,

05:50.643 --> 05:54.261
and I've got to get it back
into Peacekeeper control
without delay.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.185
One crate?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.263
You see how simple it is?

05:57.358 --> 06:01.522
Crichton:
Well, you, of course are
welcome to travel back with us, however...

06:01.612 --> 06:03.694
No, no, you see, you
don't read me.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.146
This is urgent.

06:05.241 --> 06:09.109
I'll give you a set of
coordinates to a base.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.239
We can be there in 20 arns.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.945
20 arns?

06:13.040 --> 06:16.407
But that would mean that the
base is out here in the
Uncharted Territories.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.869
Larraq:
It's a new Gammak base.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.044
Secret.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.213
Need to know only.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.291
But since you'll be
taking me there,

06:25.386 --> 06:27.752
I guess you need to know.

06:27.846 --> 06:32.556
And, yes, it is here, in the
Uncharted Territories.

06:32.643 --> 06:38.013
Hassan:
Hey! You damage the Captain's
prize and he'll have both your heads on jinka poles.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.222
Whatever you say, Doc.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.147
Hey, what's this?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.892
Uh, may I approach?

06:43.988 --> 06:45.819
Get as close as you
want, darling.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.067
The Captain's ordered me
to attend to you.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.195
There's proper food waiting in
the Centre Chamber when...

06:51.287 --> 06:52.868
when you're ready.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.571
That boot-shine Captain got a
non-reg server like you aboard?

06:55.666 --> 06:58.874
I guess he's not as big a
nerfer as I thought he was.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.826
What did he pay for you,
sweetheart?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.877
Not much, I'm sure.

07:02.965 --> 07:03.920
Sergeant...

07:04.008 --> 07:05.248
I want to check the contents.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.878
Now.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.267
(beeping and whirring)

07:28.824 --> 07:32.783
We've been out here in the
Uncharteds for nearly a full
cycle looking for that thing.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.203
That's a long time for me to
hang with just my Captain
and these two.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.872
For nearly a whole cycle?

07:38.959 --> 07:42.668
Well, that is a long time to
be... to be searching
for something.

07:42.755 --> 07:45.462
I'm sure your... your Captain 3
prize must be very valuable.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.336
That s not for you to concern
yourself with, honey.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.676
Would you like...? Oh!

07:52.890 --> 07:53.879
l-l'm sorry.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.214
-lt's no problem.
-Really.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.267
No problem at all.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.969
Hassan:
Food in the Centre Chamber.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.850
Got it. Now leave us.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.822
Ha...

08:23.253 --> 08:26.541
Too easy.

08:35.391 --> 08:40.556
They certainly don t pay much
attention to rank, do they?

08:40.646 --> 08:46.016
My people will follow every one
of my orders instantly, and
without question.

08:46.110 --> 08:50.228
| ask them to spit out of their
eye, I expect them to
drop dead trying.

08:50.322 --> 08:55.191
But make them stand up just
because I walk into a room?

08:55.285 --> 08:58.903
Come on. I respect them
too much for that.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.409
You ve never interfaced with
Special Ops before?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.082
I've heard of you.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.909
Everyone at regiment level has.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.211
Oh yes. What is it that
you call us?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.129
Black ghosts.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.421
Is that supposed to be an
insult?

09:13.512 --> 09:16.094
Cause you know,
I kinda like it.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.924
Insult, definitely.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.226
Actually, I did see one
of your type once.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.807
I was on a transfer barge. I was
changing troop ships and I...

09:27.901 --> 09:29.732
I only saw him for a
couple of microts,

09:29.820 --> 09:33.358
but I recognised the unkempt
uniform, and the undisciplined
attitude...

09:33.449 --> 09:35.565
Must have really offended you.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.900
And just think,

09:37.995 --> 09:40.782
now you re going to sit down
and eat with one.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.116
All right, enough is enough.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.167
This sham is over.
I say we storm them now.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.918
No, no, no. This is working.
They think I'm a
Peacekeeper Captain.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.045
Certainly the uniform is
convincing.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.672
Yes, we re glad the
Peacekeepers left it on board.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.469
You look very, uh, fetching.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.137
John, D'Argo is right.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.636
Perhaps we should take them now
while we still have the
element of surprise.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.467
Moya's in the final stages
of pregnancy.

10:03.562 --> 10:07.180
We have 20 arns before we're
anywhere near that base.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.606
I say we learn as much from
these guys as we can.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.934
Aeryn's supposed to be grilling
Larraq right now.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.692
And what is going to happen
when Aeryn gets sick and tired
of pretending to take your orders?

10:15.783 --> 10:18.866
John, the closer we get to that
base, the more dangerous it is
for all of us.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.613
And what if its not
the only base?

10:20.704 --> 10:24.788
I may be naive, but flying
around in the Uncharted
Territories,

10:24.875 --> 10:27.207
ignorant of what the
Peacekeepers are doing out here?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.285
That to me seems dangerous.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.085
Well I can tell you one thing
for free. I will not be
chained up again.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.289
-Fine.
-And I'm not having
that door locked.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.338
Fine.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.132
Just stay out of sight.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.927
We'd best get Rygel in
harmony with this.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.434
Rygel?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.479
Oh, he's used his hidden
escape route.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.102
Beautiful.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.899
Let's go find Sparky before
he screws this thing up.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.319
Yeah, let's find him before
you screw it up.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.409
Thorrn:
I'll take this tier.
You take a look...

11:16.635 --> 11:18.341
(whispering ):
D'Argo, come on.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.506
(whispering ):
Crichton, get out of there.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.138
D'Argo...

11:30.357 --> 11:31.392
D'Argo...

11:33.277 --> 11:34.767
(roaring)

11:36.154 --> 11:37.189
(yelling)

11:37.281 --> 11:38.316
Aah!

11:42.786 --> 11:44.902
( roars )

11:48.208 --> 11:51.120
Guess you were pretty lucky
I came along when I did,
eh, Captain?

11:51.211 --> 11:56.456
If you ever lay hands on me
again, I will have you
up on charges.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.760
D'Argo, you did well.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.019
Too well.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.846
(grunts)

12:14.651 --> 12:17.768
You ever fly anything a little
sexier than a Leviathan?

12:17.863 --> 12:19.603
Let's see...

12:19.698 --> 12:22.531
I started flying scrub runners
at fourteen cycles.

12:22.618 --> 12:26.782
Half cycle later, a KL-80,
and an 81,

12:26.872 --> 12:29.113
and then Prowler Attack School
at sixteen.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.949
Sixteen? Why'd you wait so long?

12:32.044 --> 12:33.534
I had to.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.995
My feet didn't reach
the pedals.

12:38.383 --> 12:44.049
So, you said that you've been
out here in the Uncharted
Territories for almost a full cycle?

12:44.139 --> 12:46.095
Looking for whatever that
thing is in the crate.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.641
And the sooner I get it into
somebody else's hands, the
happier I'll be.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.220
Don t ask, cause I'm not
going to tell you.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.430
Why, 'cause you'd have
to kill me then?

12:54.524 --> 12:57.061
Just stay away from it, okay?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.607
That s a Stasis Gun, isn t it?

13:01.698 --> 13:02.949
Came in handy on this trip.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.945
Well, that s for capture,
not killing.

13:06.036 --> 13:09.403
Look, you said that this base
we re heading to is a
Gammak Base.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.580
That 8 science military, right?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.783
Are you sure that its wise to
take whatever that thing is...

13:13.877 --> 13:16.414
Science military 3 perfect.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.296
Let them deal with it.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.104
Ow! Watch where you're cutting.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.228
Easy for you to say.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.454
(gasps )

13:56.545 --> 13:58.786
How dare you sneak up
on me like that.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.962
I should make you wear a bell
around your neck.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.836
Keep your fantasies to
yourself, frog boy.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.293
Fantasies? About you? Yuck!

14:06.388 --> 14:08.424
Why, I never...

14:08.515 --> 14:11.348
Oh, I've seen you looking at me.

14:11.435 --> 14:12.766
You want to be a pervo,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.218
you ought to practice subtle.

14:14.312 --> 14:18.225
Oh. Well, don't get your
shivvies in an uproar.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.181
Like I care.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.943
Thorrn, status?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.146
Yeah, Rhed.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.650
I'm going to check out
the cargo bay.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.527
Proceed.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.482
Okay, roger that.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.910
What are you doing down
here, anyway?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.785
Me? You re the one who s
supposed to stay in his cage.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.868
Well, Pilot said they were
bringing something onboard,

14:38.962 --> 14:41.248
and I thought I'd come down
here and see if I could...

14:41.339 --> 14:43.170
You're here for the same
reason I am.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.045
To see if there 3 anything
inside worth snurching.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.218
Snurch! I don't snurch.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.261
I... procure.

14:50.348 --> 14:55.388
Look, in the interest of not
getting caught, I'll agree to
half whatever we procure.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.141
Half?! l was here first.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.688
But I have the, uh... the key.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.313
Mmm. Okay, half.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.319
( beeping )

15:11.286 --> 15:13.117
(air hissing)

15:17.667 --> 15:19.919
-Open it.
-What? Me?

15:20.003 --> 15:21.368
Don t you want your half of
whatever s in there?

15:21.463 --> 15:22.623
Well, your half 3 in there too.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.376
I'm not very practical.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.958
Aye, aye, your royal frogness.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.178
Ahh...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.221
It's hot.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.850
Rygel:
What is that?

15:50.242 --> 15:52.073
( Rygel groans)

15:59.417 --> 16:00.623
Chiana:
Do you recognise the species?

16:00.710 --> 16:03.042
Even if I did, lwouldn't
admit it.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.167
Whatever it is,
it's still alive.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.212
(tone sounds)

16:10.303 --> 16:12.715
(door opening)

16:32.742 --> 16:35.233
(groaning)

16:41.168 --> 16:43.534
Rhed:
Hey Thorrn!
The Captain 3 after us.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.368
We better get down to the...

16:45.463 --> 16:47.249
Holy dren, how did that...

16:47.340 --> 16:49.331
Captain! It's Rhed!
You'd better get down...

16:51.553 --> 16:52.338
Frell.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.718
A single shot in the cargo area.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.843
Weapons fire?

16:57.934 --> 16:59.185
This charade is definitely over.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.851
Pilot, open these doors now!

17:13.408 --> 17:14.272
( screeching )

17:14.367 --> 17:15.152
What's he doing?

17:15.243 --> 17:16.107
Shh!

17:16.203 --> 17:17.659
( screeching )

17:21.124 --> 17:22.910
( screeching )

17:23.001 --> 17:24.286
( screeching stops )

17:24.377 --> 17:25.207
I've had enough.

17:25.295 --> 17:25.954
Rygel!

17:26.046 --> 17:27.161
(gasping)

17:32.886 --> 17:34.217
(growling)

17:45.523 --> 17:46.933
(growling)

17:47.025 --> 17:49.016
(gasping)

18:05.168 --> 18:06.283
( groans )

18:31.027 --> 18:32.858
Aeryn:
One down.

18:39.869 --> 18:40.824
Spread out.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.119
If it moves, shoot it.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.371
What is that?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.293
What is going on here?

18:53.425 --> 18:55.256
It's escaped.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.344
What has escaped?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.435
She's dead.
Somebody suffocated her.

19:11.526 --> 19:15.064
"It has escaped."
What exactly is "it," Captain?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.270
Over there.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.355
Aeryn, no!
Step back from him, now!

19:19.909 --> 19:22.241
What are you so frelling
afraid of?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.245
Captain?

19:26.333 --> 19:29.370
Peacekeeper Command sent us out
here on a fugitive recovery.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.373
The fugitive we're after
is a virus.

19:32.464 --> 19:36.878
When we finally isolated the
virus, it was using that
creature as a host.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.344
An intellant virus?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.760
We caught the virus in its
single infection stage.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.929
Meaning it can only infect
one host at a time.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.972
Unless it gets a chance
to lay its spores.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.015
Spores?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.558
Yeah. Give it an em in
a single host.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.351
It can lay a couple of
million spores.

19:49.439 --> 19:53.432
It does that and this whole end
of the galaxy s in some serious
frelling dren.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.187
Right, then.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.735
That virus was inside the
creature, now its somewhere
on the ship.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.904
Not somewhere.
It's inside someone.

19:59.991 --> 20:03.154
The virus isn t airborne. It
can only move from one host to
another by physical proximity.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.200
You have to be really close
to whoever's got it.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.824
Start talking, Thorrn.

20:06.915 --> 20:07.870
What happened?

20:07.957 --> 20:09.163
I don't remember.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.660
( crashing )
Captain!

20:10.752 --> 20:12.117
Chiana!

20:15.256 --> 20:18.293
Lower your weapon, Captain.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.307
Chiana?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.726
On your feet, now.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.647
What happened here?

20:34.734 --> 20:38.272
I... l was walking past
and H saw Rygel.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.194
He-he opened up that crate.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.317
Somehow, he-he got it open.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.115
-Who's Rygel?
-The Hynerian prisoner.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.035
The Peacekeeper came in.
He, uh... he attacked.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.738
He knocked him down.
He stole his weapon and
shot the other one.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.573
Rygel.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.704
The virus can make a host's
muscles fire all at once,
increasing strength.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.376
Thorrn, is that what happened?

20:55.463 --> 20:57.078
-It could have happened.
-Where d this Rygel go?

20:57.173 --> 20:58.253
Chiana:
The shaft.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.456
The access shaft.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.667
He could be anywhere
on the ship.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.424
We ve gotta find him before the
virus has time to incubate or
transfer to another host.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.383
How the frell did one of your
prisoners get loose?

21:14.357 --> 21:16.439
Let me get this straight.

21:16.526 --> 21:20.144
Rygel has been possessed by
some Mensa member virus that's
going to lay eggs

21:20.238 --> 21:23.150
that s going to infect all of
us in like an am if we
don't find him.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.947
That's about it.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.286
Great. Well I think under the
circumstances our little
masquerade is over.

21:27.370 --> 21:30.862
Under the circumstances, those
commandos are primed to shoot
at anything they do not trust.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.120
The only thing that is over is
our chance to take them
by surprise.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.292
This is a disaster, Crichton.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.371
It is a grave misfortune that
that uniform did not fit me.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.713
Always a party.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.136
Come on, stick with me.
You'll be safer.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.819
Crichton:
What is going on?

22:12.707 --> 22:14.163
D'Argo:
Surrender yourselves!

22:14.250 --> 22:17.413
It appears more of your
prisoners have escaped, Captain.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.082
We don't have time for this.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.380
You get into a fire fight,
there may be no one left
to find the Hynerian.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.798
We need them.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.928
We take them down fast.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.175
Let's do it now.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.722
Ka D Argo.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.222
Zotoh Zhaan.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.271
There is a situation aboard this
ship which you are unaware of.

22:38.358 --> 22:43.148
A situation which threatens
all of us.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.445
We have an intellant
virus aboard.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.069
It is using the Hynerian
as a host.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.741
He has escaped and is hiding
somewhere in the ship.

22:50.828 --> 22:57.745
If we do not find him, isolate
him before this virus has a
chance to lay its spores,

22:59.212 --> 23:01.373
then we all die.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.607
We have to work together
on this deal.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.994
We search fast and thorough,
in pairs.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.167
Nobody goes it alone from
this moment on.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.996
The virus's best defense is
moving from one host to another

23:44.090 --> 23:46.877
while nobody's watching until
nobody knows who it's in.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.959
Then it waits and lays
its spores.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.260
There's no way of testing
for its presence?

23:51.347 --> 23:55.386
Well the hosts body will show
signs of higher acidity, but
only after the virus has left.

23:55.476 --> 23:59.515
So while the virus is
inhabiting, there is no way of
telling, until its too late.

23:59.606 --> 24:03.690
You see the Hynerian, you hit
your Comms and stay
away from him.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.233
No physical contact whatsoever.

24:06.321 --> 24:11.031
Believe me, you do not want
this thing choosing you to
incubate its spores.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.698
Crichton:
Right then.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.616
Let's do it.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.204
Pilot.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.247
Yes, Captain.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.199
Repon.

24:21.294 --> 24:24.536
My DRDs have checked all
tiers and passageways.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.916
No signs of him.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.419
I suspect he is still in the
access shaft system.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.010
Concentrate your search there.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.755
As you wish, Captain.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.132
Shall we shaft it?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.238
Zhaan:
When the virus moves from
one host to another,

24:56.329 --> 24:59.617
doesn't the original host
remember being infected?

24:59.707 --> 25:02.995
No. The virus leaves behind
a mild hallucinogenic

25:03.086 --> 25:05.543
which disrupts the whole
short-term memory syste,m

25:05.630 --> 25:10.044
leaving them a little dizzy and
confused, but they remember
nothing of the experience.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.799
My people had an experience
with an intellant virus once.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.177
An entire exploration colony
was destroyed.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.634
My mother had family there, but
even the Delvian High Council

25:21.729 --> 25:23.970
couldn t do anything about it.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.353
Sorry to bore you.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.832
Come on, Pip.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.305
When you first found this
thing, why didn't you kill it
while you had a chance?

26:03.396 --> 26:05.432
That wasn't the mission.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.060
The mission was to
capture one alive.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.439
That's what my team and l have
spent the better part of a
cycle doing out here.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.860
Or what's left of my team.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.438
Why would anybody want
this thing alive?

26:15.533 --> 26:19.196
To study it, tame it
if they can.

26:19.287 --> 26:23.906
When you release a cloud of
intelligent, controlled viruses
among your enemy,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.458
a few arns later, their entire
army's now working for you.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.297
All right.

26:30.381 --> 26:35.296
But capturing one. That's
clearly a suicide mission.

26:35.386 --> 26:36.501
It was a challenge.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.211
A challenge?

26:38.306 --> 26:40.922
A challenge that has cost you
three members of your crew.

26:41.017 --> 26:45.761
Four, and it may cost a lot
more than that before we
capture it again.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.102
You first.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.813
You have the weapon.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.614
You first.

27:05.166 --> 27:09.751
We ve got to find Rygel soon.
The arn's almost up.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.250
How does a damned virus get
to be so smart anyway?

27:13.341 --> 27:15.127
Whats it do?

27:15.218 --> 27:17.174
When we find Rygel,
if we find Rygel,

27:17.261 --> 27:21.300
we better find some way to kill
this stinking virus without
killing him.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.470
Aeryn:
We've found him.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.843
Locaﬂon.

27:23.935 --> 27:25.471
Centre Chamber.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.392
On the way.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.811
( Rygel gasping )

27:28.898 --> 27:31.264
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

27:31.359 --> 27:35.398
I'm not coming out of here
until you tell me what the
yotz is going on.

27:35.488 --> 27:39.822
Well, he is trapped but you
don t have a very clear shot.

27:41.577 --> 27:46.571
lfl miss, it takes this
Stasis Gun several microts
to recharge.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.998
Hassan:
We don't have several microts.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.950
Why not just use a regular
pulse rifle?

27:51.045 --> 27:54.788
No. No, I've got to
take him alive.

28:01.389 --> 28:03.300
What the yotz are you going
to do with that?!

28:03.391 --> 28:05.177
Certainly sounds like
the Hynerian.

28:05.268 --> 28:08.726
It's supposed to. That's
exactly what the virus does.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.179
Listen to me. Let me explain.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.473
I'm not the man you want.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.183
It's that thing, isn't it?

28:15.278 --> 28:16.859
The thing in the box?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.909
...but I wasn t the
only one there!

28:25.997 --> 28:27.203
Listen to me!

28:27.290 --> 28:28.905
I'm not the guilty
party in this!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.365
( fires )

28:33.880 --> 28:35.165
Hit him.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.292
He's down.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.546
All right, let s get him out of
there into the containment box
down below, now.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.110
Zhaan:
I must formulate some
sort of antibody

29:04.201 --> 29:06.328
that will kill the virus
without killing Rygel.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.993
Yes, this is why you should be
in the transport hangar

29:08.080 --> 29:10.696
working with your apothecary
and not in a locked cell.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.292
And what if you don t?

29:12.376 --> 29:14.537
You might kill Rygel. You might
think your magic pill worked,

29:14.629 --> 29:17.962
and then Rygel's up walking
around the ship, coughing
up spores.

29:18.049 --> 29:20.131
Cats and dogs living together.
No, no, no.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.345
Our only chance is to talk to
the Peacekeeper science officer.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.592
What's her name, the one
with the nice lips.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.098
Hassan.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.517
If anybody knows about an
antibody, it will be her.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.845
And, D'Argo, forget about
the use of force.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.647
You think you can make Hassan
tell you about the antibody?

29:36.734 --> 29:38.474
Name me the Peacekeeper
you've met

29:38.569 --> 29:41.936
who'd give a royal dren if you
stuck a charged pulse rifle
to their head?

29:42.031 --> 29:45.068
But John, we are on a direct
course for the Peacekeeper base.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.445
And I would rather not be locked
in the cell when we arrive.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.744
And I say we need to find out
about the base.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.241
We have the time. Let's use it.

29:52.333 --> 29:56.246
Let's not blow it by going
around the ship waving
guns about.

29:56.337 --> 30:00.205
The antibody is top priority.

30:00.299 --> 30:05.134
Look, as soon as I leave here,
I'm going straight to hot lips.

30:05.221 --> 30:06.836
Trust me.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.147
Came to see if you
needed a hand.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.699
Doesn't look like you do.

30:28.786 --> 30:30.401
No.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.282
I reckon not.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.947
Right, then.

30:44.677 --> 30:49.216
Aeryn:
So, what happens to the
Hynerian once the virus has been leeched out of him?

30:49.306 --> 30:53.800
Larraq:
He doesn't know this, but he's
already spoken his dying words.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.351
Hassan:
It's not a pretty process.

31:07.033 --> 31:11.697
You know, I talk about the
challenge of bringing in this
fugitive virus, but...

31:11.787 --> 31:15.279
numerically speaking, I'd have
to say it's winning.

31:18.502 --> 31:23.292
You know this may sound funny,
but you ever think about
going Special Ops?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.133
Me?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.424
I've seen you in action.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.764
What are you doing in
Ustar Regiment, huh?

31:30.848 --> 31:32.679
You're being wasted there.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.224
You're wasting yourself there.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.606
Plus, I...

31:42.693 --> 31:45.685
I like the idea of having
you nearby.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.823
Bad timing.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.156
Let 3 just get this assignment
closed down, huh?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.707
No, it isn tthat.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.001
Look, I know you ve got your
Captain to consider,

32:06.092 --> 32:09.050
and High Command s going to have
plenty to say on the subject.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.299
But if you and I get some time
at the Gammak Base,

32:12.389 --> 32:16.632
maybe we can sit down,
talk about it.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.289
Captain.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.619
Lieutenant.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.455
This is quite a collection
of herbs and spices.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.757
Who uses them?

32:51.846 --> 32:55.589
No one, now.

32:55.683 --> 33:01.269
I have no idea who was aboard
prior to this technician.

33:01.355 --> 33:05.724
Well, there's a fascinating
accumulation from so many
different worlds.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.524
( crashing )

33:07.611 --> 33:10.318
(thudding)

33:26.463 --> 33:29.330
D'Argo:
They believe that the virus
is still inside Rygel?

33:29.425 --> 33:32.292
Yes, but they also think
there's no test to be certain.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.716
Pilot said you wanted to see me.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.219
Yes. Tell me how you're feeling.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.299
I'm fine.

33:40.394 --> 33:41.725
Any dizziness?

33:41.812 --> 33:43.348
No.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.392
Well, yeah, a little. But...

33:46.483 --> 33:48.690
how did you know that?

33:51.697 --> 33:53.107
Here, lick this.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.190
What? That's your bedcover.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.240
ls everybody aboard this
ship kinkoid?

33:57.328 --> 34:00.820
This material contains litmus
fibers. Now, just lick it.

34:10.341 --> 34:11.706
Acid.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.636
You had the virus in you.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.381
What? Are you tinked?

34:16.472 --> 34:20.056
When the virus leaves its
host it leaves behind a
telltale acidity.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.507
Don't you think I'd remember
if I had some sort of...

34:21.602 --> 34:23.183
No, you wouldn't.

34:23.270 --> 34:27.183
If the virus is no longer in
Rygel, then it must be in
somebody else.

34:27.274 --> 34:30.562
Pilot, you reported an
increase in speed?

34:30.653 --> 34:31.859
Yes, Lieutenant.

34:31.946 --> 34:34.779
The Captain is accelerating
our approach

34:34.865 --> 34:38.449
towards the coordinates given
to me by Captain Larraq.

34:38.535 --> 34:40.071
Is that the case, Captain?

34:40.162 --> 34:42.027
It is, Lieutenant.

34:42.122 --> 34:46.115
I want us at that Gammak base
and that bug off my ship as
fast as possible.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.370
I couldn't agree more.

34:47.461 --> 34:50.328
Hmm.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.208
(whispering ):
What are you doing
accelerating?

34:52.299 --> 34:55.166
I'm doing exactly what a
commander in my position
would do.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.547
These commandos are not stupid.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.880
I'm doing my part. You do
yours. Get the damned
information.

35:04.728 --> 35:10.018
It's a rather large
galaxy, Captain.

35:10.109 --> 35:15.604
How did you ever manage to find
something as tiny as a virus?

35:16.573 --> 35:18.074
Perseverance.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.194
Larraq, about the
Gammak base, we're...

35:20.286 --> 35:25.656
You must be a very patient man.

35:25.749 --> 35:29.958
Very methodical man.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.421
I'm a good tracker.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.086
( Crichton chuckles )

35:33.173 --> 35:37.166
Oh, I'd say a great tracker.

35:37.261 --> 35:38.876
Captain?

35:40.597 --> 35:41.803
The Maintenance Bay.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.427
Lieutenant Hassan, she's dead.
Executed.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.305
The Stasis Gun, it's destroyed.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.146
Nobody move.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.194
No!

36:01.869 --> 36:03.530
The virus is still loose!

36:05.372 --> 36:07.078
I believe it's in Crichton.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.887
Oh, no.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.353
What's going on?

36:42.368 --> 36:44.279
Aeryn:
Don't move.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.452
Crichton:
Are you people crazy?

36:50.292 --> 36:52.374
What's everybody looking at?

36:54.963 --> 36:57.124
What's everybody looking at?!

36:57.216 --> 36:59.127
Zhaan:
The virus, John.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.083
It's in one of us.

37:02.429 --> 37:06.342
(all shouting)

37:06.433 --> 37:07.218
Shut up.

37:07.309 --> 37:08.424
Stay back!

37:08.519 --> 37:10.760
Put it down.
Drop your weapons! Now!

37:10.854 --> 37:12.355
Shut up!

37:13.148 --> 37:15.855
Shut up! All of you, shut up!

37:15.943 --> 37:17.649
Somebody talk to me!

37:17.736 --> 37:19.943
The virus was inside of you and
now it is inside one of them.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.193
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do
you mean, the virus was in me?

37:23.283 --> 37:25.410
It wasn t ever in Rygel.
It was in Chiana.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.609
She passed it to you.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.568
Chiana:
ldon't remember a thing!

37:28.664 --> 37:31.246
And you won't. Neither will you,
John. It's part of the
virus's defense...

37:31.333 --> 37:33.574
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's this "John" dren?

37:33.669 --> 37:36.285
That topic is off at the
moment, Captain.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.711
If indeed you are the Captain.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.880
The virus was inside Chiana?

37:39.967 --> 37:42.458
Her body's acidity was
abnormally high.

37:42.553 --> 37:44.259
That is the sign.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.337
Can the virus re-enter someone
after it's left them?

37:46.432 --> 37:47.217
No.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.298
Good. Chiana, over here.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.226
Hey, hey, wait a second.
Who are you?

37:53.313 --> 37:55.099
Off topic, Captain, remember?

37:55.190 --> 37:59.354
Okay, so the virus is inside of
one of you and you all got
guns. Great.

37:59.445 --> 38:03.188
We will shoot at it if it
starts shooting and kill it
where it stands.

38:03.282 --> 38:06.399
That's only mildly comforting,
Aeryn, since the virus will
probably start shooting first.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.905
I say we cut the odds and
smoke em all right

38:08.996 --> 38:11.237
Yeah? How do we know it
isn't in you, huh?

38:11.331 --> 38:13.743
Maybe what you really want is
to cut the competition.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.495
How do we know it isn't
in you Captain?

38:15.586 --> 38:18.874
Twisted as it sounds, what we
have right here is exactly
what we need:

38:18.964 --> 38:21.296
guns in a lot of hands,
pointed in every direction.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.884
What about that freezo
gun you had?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.924
You destroyed it.

38:25.012 --> 38:28.095
What we need is some way to
kill the virus, now, while
we ve got it trapped here.

38:28.182 --> 38:30.548
Yes, an antibody. Zhaan said
that she could make one.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.677
You willing to try that?

38:31.768 --> 38:34.145
I'm willing to try anything.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.448
Zhaan:
You realize I don't have the
components I once did.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.370
Aeryn:
Just keep working, Zhaan.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.119
I figure with such high acidity,

38:56.210 --> 38:59.452
I need something that will
adjust the body's alkali levels,

38:59.546 --> 39:03.130
and bump up each species'
natural immune system.

39:03.217 --> 39:06.926
Yeah, well, whatever it is
you're taking it first.

39:20.817 --> 39:24.435
Hey, lighten up.
You didn't do it.

39:25.489 --> 39:27.605
Well, you did, but...

39:27.699 --> 39:29.690
it wasn't really you.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.374
Ready.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.503
I know, me first.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.362
How will we know it has worked?

40:09.449 --> 40:11.735
An acid-based life-form would
have a noticeable reaction

40:11.827 --> 40:15.786
to this level of alkaline,
even if it doesn't kill it.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.372
Well, you all saw the
components that I put in.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.416
Right.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.710
Over here.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.087
Okay.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.380
Who's next?

40:40.314 --> 40:42.305
|wi||.

41:00.751 --> 41:02.537
Told you.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.212
Do it.

41:25.692 --> 41:26.602
It's the Luxan!

41:26.693 --> 41:27.273
It's him!

41:27.361 --> 41:28.817
Drop your weapon!

41:28.904 --> 41:32.317
(all yelling)

41:32.407 --> 41:33.522
Put your weapon down!

41:33.617 --> 41:35.824
Shoot him now! What are you
waiting for?!

41:35.911 --> 41:38.744
I am telling you to
drop your weapon!

41:38.830 --> 41:40.161
All right, do it!

41:40.248 --> 41:41.499
Come on, just do it.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.450
So we can prove it's him
and we can kill him!

41:46.463 --> 41:48.203
Come on.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.215
Eenie...

41:56.264 --> 41:57.720
meenie...

42:00.811 --> 42:02.676
minie...

42:07.317 --> 42:08.898
D'Argo.

42:14.408 --> 42:15.739
Stop him!

42:30.382 --> 42:31.212
Crichton:
Pilot?!

42:31.299 --> 42:32.209
I've been monitoring.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.631
DRDs are searching.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.926
Cut him off! Don't let
him off this tier!

42:36.012 --> 42:39.254
Closing access points now.

43:01.288 --> 43:02.448
(grunts)

43:04.875 --> 43:05.955
Larraq?

43:06.042 --> 43:07.703
Not exactly.

43:07.794 --> 43:10.911
But this shell of his is going
to get me onto that
Peacekeeperbase.

43:27.314 --> 43:28.804
Stay back!

43:30.650 --> 43:34.643
I learned a lot from the time
I spent inside you.

43:34.738 --> 43:37.480
You fugitives want to stay away
from that Peacekeeper base

43:37.574 --> 43:40.236
as badly as I want to get there.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.283
So here's what we're
going to do.

43:42.370 --> 43:48.161
You're going to let me into
that Marauder ship without
any interference.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.459
And then you're free to blast
yourselves as far from here
as you want.

43:51.546 --> 43:54.663
If the virus is allowed to
spawn it could contaminate
thousands of species

43:54.758 --> 43:56.544
before it's able to be
contained again.

43:56.635 --> 43:59.297
I'm sorry. Is that a problem?

43:59.387 --> 44:01.639
Crichton, you just do
what you have to do!

44:02.766 --> 44:07.430
This Larraq guy, he
really liked you.

44:07.521 --> 44:09.352
A lot.

44:10.732 --> 44:12.142
Aeryn!

44:12.234 --> 44:13.815
D'Argo:
No!

44:13.902 --> 44:15.312
No!

44:17.280 --> 44:18.269
God!

44:18.365 --> 44:19.730
You go! Go after him!

44:19.825 --> 44:22.567
The virus can't re-infect you.
Go! Go!

44:25.247 --> 44:26.783
Zhaan! Chiana!

44:26.873 --> 44:29.250
Larraq is headed towards
the Transport Hangar!

44:29.334 --> 44:34.454
Zhaan, I need you down here,
Tier Seven, hamman side
passageway. Come on, quick!

44:34.965 --> 44:36.375
Hurry!

44:40.220 --> 44:41.505
(grunting)

44:55.443 --> 44:58.185
(engine starting)

45:06.329 --> 45:08.240
The Transport Hangar.

45:08.331 --> 45:10.617
Pilot, seal the outer
transport doors!

45:10.709 --> 45:13.542
No! Pilot, is that ship still
leaking cesium fuel?

45:13.628 --> 45:14.617
Yes.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.078
Then let him go.

45:20.427 --> 45:22.884
Pilot, stand by for Starburst.

45:26.266 --> 45:28.848
Moya is in no condition
to Starburst.

45:28.935 --> 45:31.517
Crichton:
Not full Starburst,
just the first stage.

45:31.605 --> 45:37.066
And I want this ship nose to
tail where she is, one hundred
and eighty degrees, right now!

45:42.115 --> 45:45.278
On my command...

45:45.368 --> 45:46.574
now!

45:55.211 --> 45:56.246
Boom.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.968
You can relax. You'll soon
be back to normal.

46:06.056 --> 46:07.717
Will I?

46:07.807 --> 46:11.925
Well, I don't think I'll ever
recover from that infernal
inferno contraption.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.012
There aren't enough cold towels
in the universe for a start.

46:15.106 --> 46:18.473
Perhaps we should lock you up
in a refrigeration unit
for a few arns.

46:18.568 --> 46:22.026
At least then we wouldn't
have to listen to your
incessant whining.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.149
Oh, such sympathy.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.492
Of course, I should expect
nothing less from you.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.238
You can expect less than
nothing from me.

46:29.329 --> 46:30.910
You conspired to open
that crate.

46:30.997 --> 46:34.160
Anything that happens to you
now you brought upon yourself.

46:34.250 --> 46:37.162
I'm sure he has learned
his lesson, D'Argo.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.873
I see you have removed the
chains from your cell.

46:42.968 --> 46:46.460
And I will take great pleasure
in destroying them.

46:46.554 --> 46:51.264
If there is one thing I have
learnt from this fiasco it s
that I will never be chained up again.

46:51.351 --> 46:53.091
I pray that will be the case.

46:53.186 --> 46:55.302
You can pray all you like.

46:55.397 --> 46:59.310
I was expressing a fact,
not a hope.

46:59.401 --> 47:02.564
I understand your pain, D Argo.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.026
Eh, difficult?

47:07.117 --> 47:08.277
Difficult?

47:08.368 --> 47:11.485
Any deception where I end up
boxed on slow bake like

47:11.579 --> 47:15.788
some ugarian table spud is
an outright failure!

47:15.875 --> 47:19.038
Course I knew from the start
that Crichton d never
pull it off.

47:19.129 --> 47:20.835
Really?

47:20.922 --> 47:22.628
Yet you let him lock you
in your cell

47:22.716 --> 47:25.583
while an unknown amount of
Peacekeepers were allowed
on board.

47:25.677 --> 47:27.258
Very interesting.

47:27.345 --> 47:30.337
Perhaps next time we will
follow a plan of your devising.

47:30.432 --> 47:32.343
Yes, perhaps we will.

47:32.434 --> 47:34.516
Next time.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.519
I pray there will never
be a next time.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.023
(moans)

47:53.413 --> 47:54.994
Welcome back.

47:56.833 --> 48:00.121
You know, for a while there
Zhaan wasn't too sure you
were going to make it.

48:01.421 --> 48:03.252
What's happened to the virus?

48:03.339 --> 48:04.590
It's dead.

48:08.344 --> 48:10.801
So is Larraq.

48:11.389 --> 48:13.095
He stabbed me, didn't he?

48:13.183 --> 48:14.764
Yeah.

48:16.186 --> 48:18.643
You got lucky; he missed
your heart.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.398
Closer than you think.

48:25.195 --> 48:28.779
So, um... the Peacekeeper base?

48:28.865 --> 48:30.776
We're getting as far away
from it as we can.

48:30.867 --> 48:35.201
It's still out there.
We don't know why.

48:37.332 --> 48:40.039
What are you doing
in here, anyway?

48:41.920 --> 48:45.333
Oh, ljust wanted to, um...

48:46.257 --> 48:47.918
um...

48:48.009 --> 48:49.249
the, the...

48:49.344 --> 48:50.834
Thank you.

48:52.806 --> 48:54.546
Don't mention it.

48:56.309 --> 48:58.516
Why would I ever mention it?
