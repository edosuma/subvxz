<i>Fire!</i>

01:07.297 --> 01:08.977
<i>Fire!</i>

01:14.012 --> 01:15.554
- 11:00!
- 11:00!

01:15.555 --> 01:16.985
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:25.231 --> 01:26.621
Fighter plane to the bow!

01:30.904 --> 01:34.344
<i>- 12:00! 12:00! Fire!
- 12:00! 12:00!</i>

01:37.369 --> 01:39.349
<i>- Brace for impact!
- Brace for impact!</i>

01:43.375 --> 01:46.126
<i>- Damage report!
- Damage report!</i>

01:46.127 --> 01:48.587
Fire party to the bow.
Fire party to the bow.

01:48.588 --> 01:49.978
Damage report now!

02:07.273 --> 02:09.942
Japs blew the crap out of us
at Pearl Harbor.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.236
We cowboyed up,
turned the tables on them.

02:12.237 --> 02:14.488
Ain't a whole lot of quit
in them either.

02:14.489 --> 02:17.282
Gave as good as they got.
Iwo Jima, Okinawa.

02:17.283 --> 02:19.660
- Where's this all going?
- Mainland ground invasion's

02:19.661 --> 02:21.578
only going to stretch
this war out even longer.

02:21.579 --> 02:23.706
Truman's in his third month
as President.

02:23.707 --> 02:26.000
Honeymoon's about over.

02:26.001 --> 02:29.211
America wants this war
to end and quickly.

02:29.212 --> 02:32.047
Jesus, are you talking
about the atomic bomb?

02:32.048 --> 02:34.174
Send a message loud and clear.

02:34.175 --> 02:37.177
Drop it right on Hiroshima,
military target.

02:37.178 --> 02:39.138
Ostensibly, yes.

02:39.139 --> 02:42.182
But you'll kill every man,
woman, and child,

02:42.183 --> 02:44.184
not to mention
the radioactive fallout.

02:44.185 --> 02:45.436
Even if the bomb works,

02:45.437 --> 02:47.104
and there's no guarantee
that it will,

02:47.105 --> 02:48.647
you can't fly it to Japan.

02:48.648 --> 02:53.152
We motorboat the son of a bitch.
The Tinian, Philippine Sea.

02:53.153 --> 02:54.361
With all due respect,

02:54.362 --> 02:56.155
we know their Navy's
stretched thin,

02:56.156 --> 02:57.614
but the Japanese
will spot a fleet.

02:57.615 --> 03:00.451
Not a fleet.
No escorts.

03:00.452 --> 03:02.745
One ship, a fast ship.

03:02.746 --> 03:05.122
Alone, unprotected.

03:05.123 --> 03:07.563
That's a damn suicide mission.

03:09.461 --> 03:11.670
But if it works...

03:11.671 --> 03:13.731
they're heroes.

03:17.302 --> 03:19.094
Who do you have in mind?

03:19.095 --> 03:22.222
"There will always be war

03:22.223 --> 03:26.310
until we kill off
our own species.

03:26.311 --> 03:28.020
The difference
between us and them

03:28.021 --> 03:31.190
is that we want to
do our duty and then go home.

03:31.191 --> 03:34.610
The man who flew his kamikaze plane
into the bow of our ship

03:34.611 --> 03:37.154
knew he wasn't going home.

03:37.155 --> 03:39.782
He was on a suicide mission

03:39.783 --> 03:43.660
using his body as ammunition.

03:43.661 --> 03:47.206
God help all of us
when we face an enemy like that."

03:50.377 --> 03:53.796
"In a few days it's my birthday.

03:53.797 --> 03:58.509
My best gift would be
just to see you again,

03:58.510 --> 04:00.469
my dear Louise."

04:00.470 --> 04:01.804
Yeah.

04:04.599 --> 04:06.225
- Paul?
- Sir.

04:06.226 --> 04:08.519
Can you please get this off
to Western Union?

04:08.520 --> 04:09.870
Aye aye, sir.

04:23.284 --> 04:25.204
<i>So you been sweet on this girl</i>

04:25.205 --> 04:27.788
<i>since the fourth grade and
you ain't asked her out yet?</i>

04:27.789 --> 04:29.415
You don't get it.

04:29.416 --> 04:31.542
A sophisticated debutante
like her, hell,

04:31.543 --> 04:33.585
you wouldn't know what I mean.

04:33.586 --> 04:35.295
You have to prove yourself.

04:35.296 --> 04:37.172
That's why I got to get
that promotion...

04:37.173 --> 04:39.174
<i>What, so she wouldn't
like you without a promotion?</i>

04:39.175 --> 04:40.551
<i>While you're plotting
and planning,</i>

04:40.552 --> 04:42.302
<i>you know what's happening
out there?</i>

04:42.303 --> 04:46.765
<i>Life!
So live it, my friend.</i>

04:46.766 --> 04:49.226
Holy smokes!

04:49.227 --> 04:51.287
Daddyo's got big pockets.

04:57.485 --> 04:59.319
Brian Smithwick.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.572
<i>Judge Bazemore.
How are you, sir?</i>

05:01.573 --> 05:03.449
<i>This here is my friend Mike.</i>

05:03.450 --> 05:05.242
<i>Hell of a place
you got here, sir.</i>

05:05.243 --> 05:07.253
<i>I was telling my boy Bama,
it's like that movie,</i>

05:07.254 --> 05:10.205
<i>"Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn."</i>

05:10.206 --> 05:11.832
Oh, forget it.
Mike D'Antonio.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.292
Good to meet you.

05:13.293 --> 05:14.835
He's from New York, sir.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.879
Brian, why don't you step
into my office?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.922
There's a gentleman there
who would like to meet you.

05:18.923 --> 05:21.342
Alonso, show Mike
up to the parlor,

05:21.343 --> 05:23.552
and tell those girls
to turn down that racket.

05:27.223 --> 05:31.268
Brian, Is it true we might
be finally invading Japan?

05:31.269 --> 05:33.437
Well, that has been
the rumor now for a while, sir.

05:33.438 --> 05:35.272
They don't really tell us much.

05:35.273 --> 05:37.775
I've heard we have crippled
the Japanese Imperial Navy.

05:37.776 --> 05:39.610
Well...

05:39.611 --> 05:44.198
<i>Much in large part to the men
of the USS Indianapolis.</i>

05:44.199 --> 05:45.616
Hear, hear!

05:45.617 --> 05:47.785
Do you think the war's
going to continue, son?

05:47.786 --> 05:49.578
I don't really know, sir.

05:49.579 --> 05:51.163
Do you have a son
in the military?

05:51.164 --> 05:53.791
Heavens no, son.
He's got money in steel.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.709
That's right,
war is good for business,

05:55.710 --> 05:57.378
and business
is good for America.

05:57.379 --> 06:00.339
- We're proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.258
<i>Five, six, seven, eight!</i>

06:03.259 --> 06:04.859
You girls ready?

06:13.395 --> 06:14.937
Hey, could use
a little help over here!

06:14.938 --> 06:17.481
No, no, you go ahead
and make a fool of yourself.

06:17.482 --> 06:18.792
I'm fine right here.

06:23.947 --> 06:26.407
Your friend is teaching
the dance society girls

06:26.408 --> 06:28.492
the latest dance craze
from New York.

06:29.953 --> 06:31.763
Not bad, huh?

06:35.291 --> 06:37.271
Whoo!

06:40.380 --> 06:42.548
He's a gas.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.061
All right,
I want to close on the ranks

07:37.062 --> 07:39.480
of a damn Rolls-Royce,
all right?

07:39.481 --> 07:42.066
She's the crown jewel
of the Navy!

07:42.067 --> 07:43.984
Good job.
Good job.

07:43.985 --> 07:47.321
Okay, we're gonna get this boat
looking brand-spanking new!

07:47.322 --> 07:49.365
Let them Japs know
they didn't hurt nobody!

07:49.366 --> 07:50.491
They didn't do
nothing to us, okay?

07:50.492 --> 07:52.326
Good job, sailors!

07:52.327 --> 07:55.412
No holes in my shoes,
and no holes in my boat!

07:55.413 --> 07:58.791
Hey, it's going to take two
surgeons six hours

07:58.792 --> 08:00.751
to get my size-10 boot
out of your ass

08:00.752 --> 08:02.628
if you don't get a move on, FNG.

08:02.629 --> 08:03.962
Means "friggin' new guy."

08:03.963 --> 08:06.048
- Sir.
- Carry on.

08:06.049 --> 08:08.509
Congratulations, McWhorter.
I heard the news.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.427
- A boy right?
- Can't wait to meet him.

08:10.428 --> 08:12.763
He's nine pounds and 13 ounces
of romping-stomping dynamite.

08:12.764 --> 08:13.972
And the wife's fine, too.

08:13.973 --> 08:16.058
Outstanding.
How we doing here?

08:16.059 --> 08:17.935
The Japs put a pretty
big hole in the ship,

08:17.936 --> 08:20.036
but the big guns are fine, sir.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.486
Sir? Lieutenant Standish
reporting for duty again, sir.

08:27.487 --> 08:28.737
Ready to turn these sailors

08:28.738 --> 08:32.323
into a lean,
mean fighting machine.

08:32.325 --> 08:35.327
And may I say, my father,
Admiral Percy Standish,

08:35.328 --> 08:37.847
<i>sends his regards.</i>

08:39.791 --> 08:43.900
<i>All hands stand by.
All hands, stand by.</i>

09:04.566 --> 09:06.358
Looks like you got
the damage from that Zero

09:06.359 --> 09:07.943
- repaired pretty quickly.
- Yes, sir.

09:07.944 --> 09:09.445
We finished it today.

09:09.446 --> 09:11.989
The fact that you lost
only nine men

09:11.990 --> 09:14.116
is a solid testament
to you and your crew.

09:14.117 --> 09:15.868
Nine too many.

09:15.869 --> 09:18.579
Ready to get
out there again, Captain?

09:18.580 --> 09:20.831
Admiral,
I have nine new officers

09:20.832 --> 09:22.916
and 250 new enlisted men,

09:22.917 --> 09:25.807
but we will press through
workup and be ready for sea.

09:29.674 --> 09:32.801
This way, this way.

09:32.802 --> 09:36.722
Captain, President Truman
has chosen you

09:36.723 --> 09:39.558
to lead a highly
classified mission.

09:39.559 --> 09:41.619
This is not a combat mission.

09:43.688 --> 09:46.857
<i>You will carry two pieces
of highly classified cargo</i>

09:46.858 --> 09:48.650
<i>to Tinian at best speed</i>

09:48.651 --> 09:51.028
<i>stopping only at Pearl Harbor
to refuel.</i>

09:51.029 --> 09:53.489
You leave tomorrow.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.866
Where do we pick up our escort?

09:55.867 --> 10:00.637
Charlie, this mission could save
millions of American lives.

10:01.956 --> 10:03.791
It is top-secret.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.852
There'll be no escort.

10:11.883 --> 10:14.743
Does this have something to do
with the Manhattan Project?

10:20.600 --> 10:24.853
Open that tomorrow
after you've weighed anchor.

10:24.854 --> 10:26.647
As of 0500 tomorrow,

10:26.648 --> 10:28.565
this ship is under
the direct command

10:28.566 --> 10:30.246
of the President
of the United States.

10:32.445 --> 10:33.904
Good luck, Captain.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.168
Get your butt outta my seat.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.599
Excuse me.
Sorry.

10:53.675 --> 10:55.759
Look, look, look it,
that's that cracker

10:55.760 --> 10:57.280
that's been messing with you.

10:58.847 --> 11:02.850
You told everybody
you was gonna whup his ass.

11:02.851 --> 11:04.581
What you gonna do?

11:13.820 --> 11:16.947
What? Hey.
It's still a diamond.

11:16.948 --> 11:18.490
I'll get her a better one
when I can afford it.

11:18.491 --> 11:21.118
It's not about the damn ring.

11:21.119 --> 11:22.828
I can't believe you're
about to pop the question

11:22.829 --> 11:24.580
in front of the judge.

11:24.581 --> 11:28.625
You even thought about this?
You've known her three months.

11:28.626 --> 11:30.586
I thought y'all
were just having fun.

11:30.587 --> 11:33.672
Oh, yeah,
we're having lots of fun.

11:33.673 --> 11:36.800
Besides, when you ever known
me to be scared of a judge?

11:36.801 --> 11:38.969
You miss 100 percent...

11:38.970 --> 11:42.139
Of the shots that you
don't take, yeah, I know.

11:52.192 --> 11:55.652
Just don't forget to call them
"sir" and "ma'am," all right?

11:55.653 --> 11:58.843
Hey, you're gonna be
our best man.

12:10.251 --> 12:13.003
Mama, mama, yeah, there we are.

12:13.004 --> 12:15.130
You have no shot.
No shot.

12:15.131 --> 12:16.924
Double or nothing.
Double or nothing!

12:16.925 --> 12:18.634
I'm telling you, kamikaze planes

12:18.635 --> 12:20.552
coming down from everywhere,
you know?

12:20.553 --> 12:21.993
And I'm firing back, see?
I'm like...

12:22.972 --> 12:24.682
There's planes coming...

12:24.683 --> 12:27.267
Hot damn, Sanchez,
you're cooking with gas!

12:27.268 --> 12:29.228
Ba, Ba, Ba, hey!

12:29.229 --> 12:31.230
Ba, Ba, Ba, hey!

12:31.231 --> 12:33.982
Tame your horses!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

12:33.983 --> 12:37.319
Next round's on you...

12:37.320 --> 12:40.280
How's a young fella gonna know
how much he can drink

12:40.281 --> 12:42.783
unless he knows
how much he can't?

12:42.784 --> 12:45.244
<i>It's 1945.</i>

12:45.245 --> 12:48.247
<i>Our ship is docked
in San Francisco for repairs.</i>

12:48.248 --> 12:51.375
<i>The streets are alive,
and the sailors...</i>

12:51.376 --> 12:53.919
<i>we're on the town tonight.</i>

12:53.920 --> 12:57.715
D'Antonio!
Daddy didn't mean it.

12:57.716 --> 13:00.092
Yeah, well, it sure as hell
sounded like he did, Clara!

13:00.093 --> 13:02.903
Please, wait!

13:06.266 --> 13:07.696
Mike!

13:09.019 --> 13:10.894
- D'Antonio!
- What?

13:10.895 --> 13:13.230
- Would you stop and listen to me?
- I'm listening.

13:13.231 --> 13:16.066
You need to give daddy a chance.
He just needs some time.

13:16.067 --> 13:18.694
So you never told your parents
you were slumming it, I guess.

13:18.695 --> 13:19.945
That's not what this is.

13:19.946 --> 13:22.031
That's exactly
how they looked at me!

13:22.032 --> 13:26.785
A feisty young lady in red
pursued a sailor...

13:26.786 --> 13:29.788
while another one...

13:29.789 --> 13:31.832
seemed to pursue her.

13:35.378 --> 13:38.255
Come on! come on!

13:38.256 --> 13:41.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

13:41.092 --> 13:43.969
Mess hall boy
knows about boxing.

13:43.970 --> 13:45.971
They fighting!
Hey, y'all, they fighting!

13:45.972 --> 13:47.389
That's not fair,
you can't hold that against me!

13:47.390 --> 13:48.682
D'Antonio! D'Antonio!
There's a fight.

13:48.683 --> 13:49.975
There's a fight.
There's a fight!

13:49.976 --> 13:51.935
- There's a fight!
- Stay right here.

13:51.936 --> 13:53.270
- Stay right here.
- Mike!

13:58.026 --> 13:59.706
<i>Show him what for.</i>

14:02.822 --> 14:05.324
Which one of you wants
to get sliced open first?

14:05.325 --> 14:08.952
You really need that thing?
I'm flattered.

14:08.953 --> 14:11.121
Three against five.
Little friend here makes it even.

14:11.122 --> 14:12.414
Garrison.
Maybe we shouldn't.

14:12.415 --> 14:14.333
Shut up!
Shut up, Quinn!

14:14.334 --> 14:16.460
Back up, boys.

14:16.461 --> 14:19.755
I said back up now!

14:19.756 --> 14:21.840
All right.

14:21.841 --> 14:23.300
Fair fight.

14:23.301 --> 14:24.885
You and me.

14:24.886 --> 14:27.304
You don't know nothing
about fair.

14:27.305 --> 14:30.307
You ain't on a ship now,
peckerwood.

14:30.308 --> 14:34.228
If they move, cut 'em.
If you don't, I cut you.

14:34.229 --> 14:35.813
Oh, yeah!

14:35.814 --> 14:37.054
Come on, come on.
Get up get up!

14:42.696 --> 14:44.376
<i>Garrison, It's not worth it!</i>

14:46.366 --> 14:47.449
<i>Come on!</i>

14:47.450 --> 14:48.992
<i>Yeah, knock him out, man!</i>

14:48.993 --> 14:51.053
Hey, there's a fight down there!

14:57.961 --> 14:59.503
I got the colored fella.
I got the colored.

14:59.504 --> 15:02.256
- I got the colored.
- Get him, Garrison!

15:02.257 --> 15:04.227
<i>My money's on the colored fella!</i>

15:08.179 --> 15:09.263
Soft face, boys!

15:09.264 --> 15:10.784
<i>Cut it out!</i>

15:12.517 --> 15:16.157
Back off! Back off!
Huh? I told you.

15:19.357 --> 15:21.287
It's not worth it!

15:23.278 --> 15:24.998
<i>- Get him!
- Mike!</i>

15:27.866 --> 15:29.006
Smoke his ass!

15:34.164 --> 15:36.373
Break it up!

15:36.374 --> 15:39.793
Stand down!
Stand down!

15:39.794 --> 15:41.837
Hey, listen up, listen up!

15:41.838 --> 15:43.505
Where you going with my money...

15:43.506 --> 15:46.884
Hey, hey, hey,
we just got word okay?

15:46.885 --> 15:49.386
Were shipping out,
captain's orders, okay?

15:49.387 --> 15:52.973
<i>We need to get back to the ship.</i>

15:52.974 --> 15:55.334
- Mike!
- Clara!

15:59.147 --> 16:00.564
Clara!

16:00.565 --> 16:02.858
What happens between us
is between us.

16:02.859 --> 16:04.234
Clara, let's go.

16:04.235 --> 16:05.986
I am not my father.

16:05.987 --> 16:08.207
- And you really mean that?
- Yes.

16:10.116 --> 16:12.117
D'Antonio!

16:12.118 --> 16:14.328
D'Antonio, we got to hoof it!

16:14.329 --> 16:16.413
- All right!
- No, no. No!

16:16.414 --> 16:18.874
This isn't how
it was supposed to...

16:18.875 --> 16:20.417
- I love you!
- I love you, too!

16:20.418 --> 16:22.002
Now, sailor!

16:22.003 --> 16:24.983
- Clara, let's go.
- I'll be back!

16:29.427 --> 16:34.014
<i>For those of you who are new
to the Indianapolis,</i>

16:34.015 --> 16:36.558
I am your Captain.

16:36.559 --> 16:40.896
Without me, you are worthless.

16:40.897 --> 16:42.564
You are my crew,

16:42.565 --> 16:45.984
and without you, I am worthless.

16:45.985 --> 16:48.320
Our success,

16:48.321 --> 16:51.448
our very survival...

16:51.449 --> 16:56.120
is contingent upon
our functioning together

16:56.121 --> 16:59.039
as one cohesive unit.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.917
We have the complete
confidence and trust

17:01.918 --> 17:05.838
of the commander-in-chief,
as well we should.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.132
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

17:08.133 --> 17:11.032
- Am I understood?
- Yes, sir!

18:02.187 --> 18:04.521
<i>The Indianapolis
is a heavy cruiser</i>

18:04.522 --> 18:07.608
<i>designed to take out
enemy ships and aircraft,</i>

18:07.609 --> 18:10.527
<i>but our guns are useless
against submarines.</i>

18:10.528 --> 18:14.156
<i>That's why normally,
we are sent out with an escort</i>

18:14.157 --> 18:17.451
<i>of destroyers in front of us
that act as blockers.</i>

18:17.452 --> 18:20.621
<i>Their job is to detect
and destroy enemy subs</i>

18:20.622 --> 18:23.540
<i>with depth charges
before they can get to us.</i>

18:23.541 --> 18:26.418
<i>Many of the crew are mere boys</i>

18:26.419 --> 18:31.006
<i>with no idea of the danger
we face out here at sea.</i>

18:31.007 --> 18:33.592
<i>If we are fired upon
by an enemy sub</i>

18:33.593 --> 18:36.970
<i>and if miraculously
we spot it early enough,</i>

18:36.971 --> 18:41.016
<i>we have at maximum four minutes
before the torpedo arrives.</i>

18:41.017 --> 18:43.268
<i>Our main defense is to get
the ship watertight</i>

18:43.269 --> 18:45.646
<i>point station zebra
so any hull rupture</i>

18:45.647 --> 18:47.356
<i>doesn't spread and sink us.</i>

18:47.357 --> 18:49.650
<i>For the secret mission,
we are in effect</i>

18:49.651 --> 18:53.070
<i>a glorified postal service
delivering two packages</i>

18:53.071 --> 18:57.431
<i>with no protection,
but mine is not to reason why.</i>

19:03.415 --> 19:06.500
Hey, W Division
was seven seconds faster

19:06.501 --> 19:09.169
than everybody else,
even without you.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.770
Bullshit!

19:13.091 --> 19:17.052
Hey, farm boy,
chew on that first.

19:19.222 --> 19:22.433
Ah, eat that.
That's gold.

19:22.434 --> 19:27.604
Yeah, you bastard.

19:27.605 --> 19:30.107
Concerned about submarines, sir?

19:30.108 --> 19:32.443
Hard to hit what you can't see.

19:32.444 --> 19:36.280
If I may, protocol
would be to zigzag, sir.

19:36.281 --> 19:39.366
Not so effective
against kaitens.

19:39.367 --> 19:41.118
Kaitens?

19:41.119 --> 19:45.039
It's a new Japanese weapon,
a manned suicide torpedo,

19:45.040 --> 19:47.333
like an underwater
kamikaze plane.

19:47.334 --> 19:49.543
If the enemy fires a kaiten,

19:49.544 --> 19:52.463
they can recalibrate
your position on the fly.

19:52.464 --> 19:55.734
We're faster than their subs,
but not their kaitens.

22:18.735 --> 22:20.194
General quarters.

22:22.822 --> 22:25.240
Send it up, come on!

22:25.241 --> 22:27.221
<i>Move it!</i>

23:41.860 --> 23:43.736
- Battle stations!
- Battle stations!

23:46.865 --> 23:48.795
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

23:55.415 --> 23:56.749
Load us up!

23:56.750 --> 23:58.625
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

23:58.626 --> 24:00.346
<i>Man your stations!</i>

24:02.547 --> 24:04.548
Ready!

24:04.549 --> 24:05.591
Down!

24:05.592 --> 24:07.468
Ammo! Ammo!

24:07.469 --> 24:09.720
- Go!
- Ready!

24:09.721 --> 24:11.555
<i>Fire, fire, fire!</i>

24:11.556 --> 24:13.776
<i>Fire, fire, fire, fire, come on!</i>

24:36.539 --> 24:38.624
Done!

24:38.625 --> 24:40.584
Group W can stand down.

24:40.585 --> 24:42.461
I want the big guns
running again in the dark.

24:42.462 --> 24:43.879
W, drill is over.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.382
Isolate the power in sectors
five, six, and seven.

24:46.383 --> 24:50.010
You did it!

24:50.011 --> 24:51.512
Run the test again.

24:51.513 --> 24:53.514
All right.

24:53.515 --> 24:56.433
All right, limp dicks,
cap says we go again.

24:56.434 --> 24:57.544
<i>Come on!</i>

25:17.414 --> 25:19.415
<i>You swab it,
then you swab it again!</i>

25:19.416 --> 25:22.751
<i>- If I had two of you...
- Hey!</i>

25:22.752 --> 25:25.629
Man, you are as dumb
as a bucket of bolts.

25:25.630 --> 25:27.464
Hell, boy, everybody know that.

25:27.465 --> 25:29.591
Look here,
which one is Standish's?

25:29.592 --> 25:31.927
- Is it this one right here?
- No, no, no, that's McVay's.

25:31.928 --> 25:34.054
Okay.

25:34.055 --> 25:35.889
Man, come on.

25:35.890 --> 25:38.870
Ugh.
You are nasty.

25:44.065 --> 25:46.650
Man, Quinn, what are you doing?

25:46.651 --> 25:50.070
- The right thing.
- That's too much. He's gonna know.

25:50.071 --> 25:52.051
Hope he like the pie.

25:54.826 --> 25:55.909
Captain?

25:55.910 --> 25:57.578
Good work on the guns today.

25:57.579 --> 25:59.639
Thank you, sir.

26:01.458 --> 26:07.171
What do you put in this
delicious pie, Theodore?

26:07.172 --> 26:09.465
I'm afraid that's
classified information, sir.

26:09.466 --> 26:11.675
Set it down, imbecile.

26:11.676 --> 26:12.986
Yes, sir.

26:20.727 --> 26:22.907
Is it too hot, sir?

26:25.899 --> 26:28.150
It's 42 seconds
on the big guns, sir.

26:28.151 --> 26:30.861
Four minutes
and 36 seconds on zebra.

26:30.862 --> 26:32.946
- Run it again?
- Negative.

26:32.947 --> 26:35.032
All ahead. best speed.

26:35.033 --> 26:38.160
All ahead, Bendix.

26:38.161 --> 26:41.038
<i>She was a four at port,
but she was a 10 on the ship!</i>

26:41.039 --> 26:43.624
Y'all are really lucky
I cut my right cross today.

26:43.625 --> 26:44.917
Doing what?
Changing your tampon?

26:44.918 --> 26:46.835
Yeah, laugh it up, ya mug.

26:46.836 --> 26:49.588
Okay, $75, Deuce.

26:49.589 --> 26:52.049
That's another 50
to Sanchez, right.

26:52.050 --> 26:53.940
25 to Quinn.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.597
Shit.

26:58.598 --> 26:59.598
<i>Anybody know where we're going</i>

26:59.599 --> 27:01.517
<i>after we drop cargo?</i>

27:01.518 --> 27:03.519
<i>All right, chowder heads,
who took my bag?</i>

27:03.520 --> 27:05.187
<i>Nobody took your bag, you idiot.</i>

27:05.188 --> 27:09.828
Are you worth $850,
you shiny devil, huh?

27:12.070 --> 27:14.571
<i>Alpha, Romeo, tango.</i>

27:14.572 --> 27:17.658
Sir? Where are we headed
after the drop?

27:17.659 --> 27:21.179
Not my concern.
Or yours.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.836
<i>Hey, so what's
in the crate, huh?</i>

27:28.837 --> 27:32.715
I hear it's toilet paper
for General MacArthur.

27:36.636 --> 27:39.513
So why'd you join the Marines?

27:39.514 --> 27:41.244
To kill people.

27:50.650 --> 27:52.192
Your requested cereal, Chief.

27:52.193 --> 27:55.279
Hey, Lindy here
has a confession to make.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.115
This asshole wanted
to join the Army.

27:58.116 --> 28:02.578
But he ended up in the Navy,
and he doesn't know how to swim.

28:02.579 --> 28:04.580
I'll tell him tell him why
he doesn't need to know

28:04.581 --> 28:06.123
how to swim.

28:06.124 --> 28:08.709
Because we won't be going
in the water, sir?

28:08.710 --> 28:11.837
Hey, son, you any idea
how old the ship is?

28:11.838 --> 28:14.631
It's 13 years old.
13 is an unlucky number.

28:14.632 --> 28:19.928
We have the unlucky privilege
of carrying God knows what

28:19.929 --> 28:24.141
with no protection
across the ocean.

28:24.142 --> 28:27.603
So you don't need to swim
because if you go in the drink,

28:27.604 --> 28:33.067
and the Japs don't get you...
here... the sharks will.

28:33.068 --> 28:35.027
Sharks, sir?

28:35.028 --> 28:37.029
<i>Si, señor,
the great white shark.</i>

28:37.030 --> 28:39.990
Very top of the food chain.
No natural enemies,

28:39.991 --> 28:42.660
an ancient killer left over
from the dinosaur age

28:42.661 --> 28:44.995
when there was still a big
food supply in the water.

28:44.996 --> 28:46.664
Go that way, you guys.

28:46.665 --> 28:49.750
Now up on the land
by some evolutionary accident,

28:49.751 --> 28:54.296
we developed these big brains,
and we invented weapons.

28:54.297 --> 28:57.091
So we got used to being
at the top of the food chain,

28:57.092 --> 29:00.594
but once you step
in that saltwater,

29:00.595 --> 29:03.597
right back to the bottom
of the food chain.

29:03.598 --> 29:07.810
Even if you swim well,
we look pathetic to sharks.

29:07.811 --> 29:12.189
They think were wounded,
split up the middle, you know?

29:12.190 --> 29:16.193
Five rows of dagger-like
teeth and jaws...

29:16.194 --> 29:20.614
that can bend steel.

29:20.615 --> 29:23.867
It's okay. Apparently,
we're not good eatin'.

29:23.868 --> 29:25.869
'Course, they don't know that
until they shred us up pretty good

29:25.870 --> 29:27.663
and we're bleeding everywhere

29:27.664 --> 29:30.165
and nothing turns a shark
on more...

29:30.166 --> 29:31.766
than blood.

29:33.962 --> 29:35.754
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

29:35.755 --> 29:37.715
I was sent down here
for an engine room punch.

29:37.716 --> 29:39.258
- XO send you?
- Yes, Chief.

29:39.259 --> 29:41.927
Yeah?
Look at that nose.

29:41.928 --> 29:44.408
Look at that nose!
Look at it.

29:47.058 --> 29:49.309
You can be thankful
you didn't get an engine room punch

29:49.310 --> 29:51.020
- in the nose.
- Y-yes, Chief.

29:51.021 --> 29:53.355
I wouldn't worry
about it, though.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.607
Our luck will hold

29:55.608 --> 29:57.151
as long as we have
our little white dove of peace here.

29:57.152 --> 29:59.903
She's our good luck charm.
All right, back to work!

29:59.904 --> 30:01.780
Captain wants the boat
at top speed.

30:01.781 --> 30:03.907
Chief, doves have longer
tail feathers.

30:03.908 --> 30:05.659
That's a pigeon.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.680
I know. my father
raises pigeons.

30:13.877 --> 30:15.347
Hmm.

30:18.214 --> 30:20.049
<i>We accomplished our mission,</i>

30:20.050 --> 30:24.990
<i>reaching Tinian in record time
with zero casualties.</i>

30:38.276 --> 30:40.944
<i>I fear the cargo
we were dropping off</i>

30:40.945 --> 30:44.156
<i>could change
the nature of war forever.</i>

30:44.157 --> 30:47.868
<i>Our next assignment
would be to return to combat,</i>

30:47.869 --> 30:51.330
<i>but we were still
being denied our escort</i>

31:56.062 --> 31:59.064
To the best chaplain
we ever had!

31:59.065 --> 32:01.400
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:01.401 --> 32:03.902
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:03.903 --> 32:07.823
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:07.824 --> 32:10.784
Which nobody can deny.

32:13.204 --> 32:15.039
Congrats on
your last tour, chaps.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.498
Thanks, boys.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.792
I think I'm gonna take this one back
in my quarters.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.880
Come on, short timer,
stay with us.

32:22.881 --> 32:24.548
I do appreciate Deuce
for not sneaking

32:24.549 --> 32:27.092
any unclothed women
in here tonight.

32:27.093 --> 32:29.803
Listen up, Standish
is on the prowl, all right?

32:29.804 --> 32:30.971
So keep it down.

32:30.972 --> 32:32.931
Alvin, I know
that's tough for you.

32:32.932 --> 32:35.517
Hey, I'm innocent as a dove,
father, you know me.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.038
Thanks, fellas.

32:42.776 --> 32:47.112
Admiral, I understand that
we are to sail to Leyte.

32:47.113 --> 32:50.074
Now that we have
delivered the packages,

32:50.075 --> 32:53.243
can we please have our escort?

32:53.244 --> 32:56.163
Charlie, how can you
have an escort?

32:56.164 --> 32:58.104
You were never here.

33:03.254 --> 33:05.089
Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:05.090 --> 33:09.009
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! go!

33:10.929 --> 33:12.137
Listen up, listen up,

33:12.138 --> 33:15.265
hey, hey,
who am I? Huh? Huh?

33:15.266 --> 33:18.852
Hey! I'll have y'all know...

33:18.853 --> 33:22.272
That I graduated second in
my class at the Naval Academy!

33:22.273 --> 33:24.358
Whoo!

33:24.359 --> 33:29.279
And I'm going to turn you into lean,
mean fighting machines!

33:32.867 --> 33:34.467
Attention on deck!

33:35.453 --> 33:36.643
Signalman!

33:40.291 --> 33:42.584
Where did you get that alcohol?

33:42.585 --> 33:45.004
It's actually mine.

33:45.005 --> 33:47.015
Is that so?

33:49.092 --> 33:52.242
And that liquor on his breath?
Is that yours, too?

33:56.141 --> 34:00.978
Swab up that giggle water.
We're shipping out!

34:00.979 --> 34:04.898
There will be no liberty!
We're received our orders.

34:04.899 --> 34:07.526
And you'll all be on mess hall duty
effective immediately.

34:07.527 --> 34:12.257
This isn't a minstrel show.
This is the United States Navy!

34:14.034 --> 34:16.974
And I graduated first
in my class, by the way.

34:39.184 --> 34:41.393
What in the hell?
That ain't your bag.

34:41.393 --> 34:43.937
No, it's Alvin's.
I think he took the ring.

34:43.938 --> 34:46.148
Hey, you're gonna get busted.

34:46.149 --> 34:49.150
I checked Sanchez and West.

34:49.152 --> 34:51.320
Nothing. Shit.

34:51.321 --> 34:54.406
Hey, thanks for helping me
out the other night with Standish.

34:54.407 --> 34:57.034
Wouldn't want you
to jeopardize your promotion.

34:57.034 --> 34:58.661
All right, look,

34:58.662 --> 35:02.122
the whole reason
that this ship is on a course

35:02.123 --> 35:04.375
is 'cause they charted a plan
and they followed it.

35:04.376 --> 35:07.378
So it's lucky Clara
didn't get a chance to say yes

35:07.379 --> 35:10.089
because I'm incapable
of making a plan,

35:10.090 --> 35:11.674
incapable of supporting her.

35:11.675 --> 35:14.009
I'm just saying maybe things
turned out for the best.

35:14.010 --> 35:17.262
My plan is to find
the son of a bitch that stole my ring

35:17.263 --> 35:20.224
and marry her the second
I get off this ship,

35:20.225 --> 35:22.393
and I don't care
what her parents or you

35:22.394 --> 35:24.103
or anybody else
has got to say...

35:24.104 --> 35:26.271
You the kid
that does the diving?

35:26.272 --> 35:28.941
Oh, you mean the all-knowing
Brian Smithwick?

35:28.942 --> 35:31.212
Yeah, that's him.

35:33.071 --> 35:34.613
Yeah, I do a little diving.

35:34.614 --> 35:37.074
Okay, man, we want
to know about sharks.

35:37.075 --> 35:39.618
I've been telling
Lindy here that sharks

35:39.619 --> 35:41.954
don't really bother you
unless you're bleeding.

35:41.955 --> 35:45.175
If you're bleeding,
it's a problem.

35:49.462 --> 35:51.692
I get nosebleeds.

35:54.342 --> 35:55.492
Captain's on the bridge.

35:57.303 --> 36:00.055
Captain, some of the men
are sleeping on deck again.

36:00.056 --> 36:01.432
Let them.

36:01.433 --> 36:03.600
Their racks
are hotter than Hades.

36:03.601 --> 36:06.061
- Visibility?
- Just this side of poor, sir,

36:06.062 --> 36:08.272
Got a fog rolling in.

36:08.273 --> 36:10.524
Let's get through this weather
as quickly as possible.

36:10.525 --> 36:14.069
Cease zigzagging until the fog clears,
full speed ahead.

36:14.070 --> 36:16.363
- Aye aye.
- Standish.

36:16.364 --> 36:17.614
Full speed ahead.

36:17.615 --> 36:21.035
Full speed ahead, boys.
Full speed ahead.

36:21.036 --> 36:23.704
I hear you put 24 men
on mess hall duty for a week.

36:23.705 --> 36:26.498
Yes, sir, I'm gonna
write them all up as well.

36:26.499 --> 36:29.043
The Japanese are extremely
disciplined adversary, sir.

36:29.044 --> 36:30.461
If we are to defeat them...

36:30.462 --> 36:34.732
Sometimes it's better
to be respected than feared.

37:27.352 --> 37:28.394
- D'Antonio.
- What?

37:28.395 --> 37:29.520
Night watch is that way.

37:29.521 --> 37:31.105
- He took the ring.
- What?

37:31.106 --> 37:32.564
<i>The engagement ring,
Deuce took it</i>

37:32.565 --> 37:34.149
when he pulled me
out of the fight,

37:34.150 --> 37:36.151
- pickpocketing son of a bitch.
- Come on, Deuce?

37:36.152 --> 37:38.132
Ugh, you smell like
a distillery.

37:46.538 --> 37:49.415
Might as well go on and admit.
You was scared, boy.

37:49.416 --> 37:53.085
Scared? Of you?
You hit like a girl.

37:53.086 --> 37:56.714
Next time I'm scared of a fight,
it'll be the first damn time.

37:56.715 --> 38:00.759
Boy, you better be glad them MPs
saved your ass from us.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.845
Else we have to take you
like this chicken bone here.

38:02.846 --> 38:04.847
Hey, Mr. Big Talk,

38:04.848 --> 38:05.889
whatever you do to that there

38:05.890 --> 38:07.349
flight deck buzzard bone,

38:07.350 --> 38:10.227
that's exactly what
I'm going to do to you

38:10.228 --> 38:14.288
when I get out of his cage
and I catch you alone.

38:25.827 --> 38:27.847
<i>You suck that bone
like you've done that before!</i>

39:16.795 --> 39:18.837
Lady Luck is a friend of mine.

39:18.838 --> 39:21.924
Open up
and let it shine. Huh?

39:21.925 --> 39:23.565
Yeah.

39:25.303 --> 39:27.663
- Come on, now,
- Here we go, we go.

40:02.507 --> 40:05.342
Ah, yeah, doc.
Okay.

40:05.343 --> 40:07.469
Yeah. Mmm.

40:07.470 --> 40:09.513
Deuce, where's my ring?

40:09.514 --> 40:11.807
- What the hell you talking about?
- Oh, no, you know exactly

40:11.808 --> 40:14.708
- what I'm talking about!
- No, I don't know what you're talking about!

40:16.813 --> 40:18.963
Double or nothing!
Hey!

40:25.905 --> 40:27.295
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

40:32.996 --> 40:34.556
General quarters!

40:55.894 --> 40:58.464
Out of the way!

41:07.072 --> 41:08.656
Report!

41:08.657 --> 41:11.533
All comms are down, sir!
I tried to stop the engines!

41:11.534 --> 41:13.410
- But I don't know if the signal went through!
- Stay calm.

41:13.411 --> 41:14.912
Cavanaugh,
keep trying to get through.

41:14.913 --> 41:17.790
Standish, I want eyes
on the damage.

41:19.542 --> 41:23.062
You heard the captain!
Go! Go!

41:24.798 --> 41:28.550
Fire control, fire control now!
Hoses, starboard side.

41:28.551 --> 41:29.593
Get that fire out!

41:36.059 --> 41:39.039
Shut the engines down!
Shut them down!

42:06.089 --> 42:07.631
Are we getting through?

42:07.632 --> 42:10.342
Radios are down,
but I Jerry-rigged the wires.

42:10.343 --> 42:11.802
- You sent the SOS out?
- Yes sir.

42:11.803 --> 42:13.345
Look at the needles.
They're moving.

42:13.346 --> 42:15.406
Good work. Carry on.

42:27.694 --> 42:29.570
Don't touch it with your hands!

42:31.823 --> 42:33.553
I told you not to touch it!

42:38.705 --> 42:40.456
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

42:42.125 --> 42:44.435
We gotta go.
We gotta go!

42:53.511 --> 42:56.138
<i>USS Indianapolis trying to
establish any and all contact.</i>

42:56.139 --> 42:58.098
- Does anybody copy?
- Anything?

42:58.099 --> 42:59.850
I don't know, sir.

42:59.851 --> 43:02.144
- Keep trying.
- Yes, sir.

43:02.145 --> 43:05.564
- Damage control.
- It's dead, sir.

43:05.565 --> 43:08.609
<i>This is USS Indianapolis.
Does anybody copy?</i>

43:08.610 --> 43:11.612
<i>This is USS Indianapolis trying
to establish any contact.</i>

43:11.613 --> 43:14.114
<i>Indianapolis, Indianapolis,
do you copy?</i>

43:14.115 --> 43:15.616
This is Leyte.

43:15.617 --> 43:17.451
- What's going on?
- Three calls, sir.

43:17.452 --> 43:19.078
One caller identified
himself as the captain.

43:19.079 --> 43:20.913
- I dispatched three tugboats...
- On whose command?

43:20.914 --> 43:22.873
Pull them back!

43:22.874 --> 43:25.042
We don't send anyone out until we
get confirmation of their position.

43:25.043 --> 43:27.628
That could be an enemy sub
trying to draw us out.

43:27.629 --> 43:28.909
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

43:43.561 --> 43:45.646
We're not going to be able
to fight this one off.

43:45.647 --> 43:47.523
She's going down.

43:47.524 --> 43:50.734
Pass the word!
Abandon ship.

43:50.735 --> 43:53.795
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

44:10.088 --> 44:12.798
<i>Help me, father.</i>

44:12.799 --> 44:15.134
Help me, father.

44:15.135 --> 44:16.844
I hear you.

44:16.845 --> 44:20.655
Help me, father!
I'm scared.

44:22.142 --> 44:24.601
Abandon ship, abandon ship!

44:24.602 --> 44:26.854
Captain's orders, abandon ship!

44:26.855 --> 44:29.035
- Grab the documents, now!
- Aye aye, sir.

44:36.489 --> 44:38.549
All hands on deck!
Abandon ship!

44:45.081 --> 44:47.541
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

44:47.542 --> 44:48.751
I've got the keys!

44:52.130 --> 44:54.256
Come on, help me, too!

44:54.257 --> 44:55.607
<i>Help me, too!</i>

44:59.679 --> 45:01.722
Come on! Come on!

45:03.266 --> 45:06.643
The keys, I dropped the keys!
I can't find them!

45:06.644 --> 45:10.105
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no!

45:10.106 --> 45:14.068
Hey, you can't leave me here!
Please come back!

45:14.069 --> 45:15.736
<i>Please!</i>

45:26.039 --> 45:28.624
Go. Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

45:28.625 --> 45:29.885
Let's go, let's go!

45:42.597 --> 45:46.183
Come on, let's go,
let's go! Let's go!

45:46.184 --> 45:50.688
<i>Please! Come back!
Please! Help!</i>

45:50.689 --> 45:55.275
Garrison, please!
You gotta come back, man!

45:55.276 --> 45:56.956
Come on, let's go!

45:58.321 --> 46:02.301
Garrison, please help me!
Come back, man! Help!

46:13.044 --> 46:15.337
Bama, toss the documents!

46:15.338 --> 46:17.589
He said, he gave the order.

46:22.095 --> 46:24.775
<i>Help!</i>

46:27.350 --> 46:29.080
<i>Help me with the raft!</i>

46:42.032 --> 46:43.342
<i>Help!</i>

46:45.076 --> 46:47.369
<i>Garrison! Garrison!</i>

46:47.370 --> 46:49.872
<i>Get the keys, man.</i>

46:49.873 --> 46:51.707
You gotta get me out here, man.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.848
Hold the light!
Hold the light!

46:56.838 --> 46:58.964
Get the keys!

46:58.965 --> 47:00.632
Garrison, hurry up!

47:05.055 --> 47:07.155
- I got it.
- Gimme.

47:12.312 --> 47:14.002
Come on.

47:17.984 --> 47:19.214
Were locked in!

47:29.704 --> 47:31.121
Abandon ship!

47:31.122 --> 47:33.874
Swim away from the ship
as fast as you can

47:33.875 --> 47:35.417
as soon as you hit the water.

47:35.418 --> 47:38.295
Try to see stay clear
of the oil.

47:38.296 --> 47:39.856
Cavanaugh, jump!

47:51.976 --> 47:53.286
That is in order!

48:10.286 --> 48:12.871
The ship's breaking.
The ship's breaking.

48:12.872 --> 48:14.432
The ship's breaking.
Listen.

48:23.258 --> 48:26.010
I'm sorry!

48:26.011 --> 48:27.720
Pray with me.
Pray with me.

48:27.721 --> 48:29.013
Our Father who art in heaven...

48:29.014 --> 48:30.889
You should have left me here.
I'm sorry, man.

48:30.890 --> 48:33.976
I'm sorry I got you killed.
I'm sorry.

48:33.977 --> 48:35.447
Thy will be done.

49:34.079 --> 49:37.599
Go, go!
Go, jump! Jump!

52:06.022 --> 52:07.502
Hello?

52:11.027 --> 52:13.946
Hello!

52:13.947 --> 52:16.031
Can anyone hear me?

52:16.032 --> 52:18.242
<i>Hello?</i>

52:18.243 --> 52:21.704
<i>Hello!</i>

52:21.705 --> 52:23.715
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

52:48.732 --> 52:50.382
Paul?

52:54.195 --> 52:55.705
Paul.

53:45.789 --> 53:48.123
Keep your head up.
Come on.

53:48.124 --> 53:50.501
Kick with me, now.

53:50.502 --> 53:54.338
Kick with me.
Kick with me. There you go.

53:54.339 --> 53:57.174
Come on, man!
Keep your head up.

54:08.395 --> 54:09.785
Oh, God.

54:39.342 --> 54:43.679
This is not safe.
We got to get to the rafts.

54:43.680 --> 54:47.516
Sir, are you crazy?
We can't leave this thing.

54:47.517 --> 54:51.270
This thing's sinking.
That's an order.

54:51.271 --> 54:52.911
No.

54:58.278 --> 54:59.918
<i>Get Lindy in the raft.</i>

55:02.449 --> 55:03.490
- Get him up.
- Come on, guys.

55:03.491 --> 55:05.891
Like this.

55:10.373 --> 55:12.207
What sunk us?

55:12.208 --> 55:14.335
It had to have been the Japs.

55:14.336 --> 55:17.516
They might still be a out there
looking to finish this off.

55:19.674 --> 55:22.468
- Did the signal go out?
- It had to.

55:22.469 --> 55:24.261
Someone will know we're missing.

55:24.262 --> 55:27.532
They'll come rescue us, boys.
They'll come rescue us.

55:38.735 --> 55:42.404
You guys okay?
The captain make it?

55:42.405 --> 55:44.335
He went down with the ship.

55:45.533 --> 55:49.787
Attention, men!
Attention!

55:49.788 --> 55:54.416
If you are able-bodied
and in a raft, get out now!

55:54.417 --> 55:58.212
The rafts are for
injured men and officers!

55:58.213 --> 56:02.925
Bring all of the provisions
over here now!

56:02.926 --> 56:05.566
<i>- Grab my hand!
- I need help over here!</i>

56:07.681 --> 56:09.371
Now!

56:13.603 --> 56:15.270
Get out of the raft!

56:15.271 --> 56:17.751
Let the injured men
into the raft now!

56:30.537 --> 56:32.257
Hold on.

56:39.713 --> 56:42.464
Captain.
Hey, you made it.

56:42.465 --> 56:45.485
Campbell.
Campbell.

56:47.679 --> 56:49.805
Medicine.

56:49.806 --> 56:51.640
I need it.

56:51.641 --> 56:56.645
Hey... you made it,
Captain, you made it.

56:56.646 --> 56:59.746
You got some morphine,
huh? Hey.

57:04.571 --> 57:07.239
You made it.

57:07.240 --> 57:10.326
Okay... ah.

57:14.414 --> 57:17.984
Ain't this a hell
of a damn note?

57:29.346 --> 57:32.639
Gotta keep the leg elevated!
Keep it elevated!

57:32.640 --> 57:35.434
Okay.

57:35.435 --> 57:37.436
Don't go nowhere.

57:37.437 --> 57:39.563
Sir, please don't go nowhere.

57:39.564 --> 57:42.983
- I'm not going.
- Don't go nowhere. Please don't go nowhere.

57:42.984 --> 57:44.864
- How's my little boy?
- He's good.

57:44.865 --> 57:48.656
- Yeah.
- He's strong, like his daddy.

57:48.657 --> 57:52.284
He is? Don't go nowhere.
Don't leave me here.

57:52.285 --> 57:55.045
I'm not.
I'm not leaving you.

58:23.066 --> 58:25.401
<i>What I'm saying, Fireplug,</i>

58:25.402 --> 58:27.444
<i>is if you gotta leave a woman,</i>

58:27.445 --> 58:30.656
you always make sure
she thinks she left you.

58:30.657 --> 58:32.616
Yeah? And how do
you do that?

58:32.617 --> 58:35.661
That requires
a level of sophistication

58:35.662 --> 58:38.747
you have not yet
acquired, my friend.

58:40.583 --> 58:43.085
Calm down!
Save your energy!

58:43.086 --> 58:44.753
Calm down!

58:44.754 --> 58:47.464
You too good
to flag a plane, sir?

58:47.465 --> 58:49.550
Oh, you think me waving
would've made the difference?!

58:49.551 --> 58:51.468
I'll kill you!

58:51.469 --> 58:54.098
- I will have you court-martialed, sailor!
- Go ahead!

58:54.099 --> 58:56.098
If we get rescued...
and if we get rescued...

58:58.768 --> 59:01.812
Let's all cool off!
We're going to get rescued soon.

59:01.813 --> 59:04.565
These men look to us on how
to conduct themselves.

59:04.566 --> 59:06.536
We need each other.

59:08.111 --> 59:11.051
I need to get the life
jacket off the doctor.

59:18.913 --> 59:21.707
Father, bless his soul,

59:21.708 --> 59:25.836
in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

59:25.837 --> 59:29.006
How much longer are we going
to circle, an hour, a day?

59:29.007 --> 59:30.883
Keep looking.

59:30.884 --> 59:33.093
It's nine men lost on one plane,
Lieutenant.

59:33.094 --> 59:34.803
It's beyond a needle
in a haystack.

59:34.804 --> 59:36.722
<i>Even with coordinates,
we barely have enough fuel</i>

59:36.723 --> 59:37.890
<i>to get back to base.</i>

59:39.893 --> 59:41.101
<i>Do you copy?</i>

59:41.102 --> 59:43.145
<i>You got eyes on that plane?</i>

59:43.146 --> 59:44.605
That's a negative, sir.

59:44.606 --> 59:46.982
Request a few
more beats out here.

59:46.983 --> 59:49.443
<i>Negative, you've been
out there too long as it is.</i>

59:49.444 --> 59:51.987
<i>Bring it back.</i>

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:10.089
This way, right over here.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.590
Just grab on.

01:00:15.637 --> 01:00:18.972
Quinn...

01:00:18.973 --> 01:00:21.016
your head looks like
40 miles of bad road.

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.560
<i>We gotta get you in the raft.</i>

01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:26.105
Unh-unh, no.

01:00:26.106 --> 01:00:28.899
Not with him, no.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.902
Keep playing.
Keep playing.

01:00:36.449 --> 01:00:40.703
Theo, What in the hell you
writing in that book now, boy?

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:43.789
"Dear Mama, I should've
learned how to swim.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.709
But now my black ass
gonna drown."

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.880
What are you all laughing at,
huh?

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:54.967
We're all gonna die, you know?

01:00:54.968 --> 01:00:56.927
You know that, right?

01:00:56.928 --> 01:01:00.889
I mean, the funny part is
you mess hall boys are dying for a country

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:04.476
that doesn't give a shit
about you or your people.

01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:06.520
<i>Yeah, well,
I ain't waiting for no white folks</i>

01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:09.940
or anybody else to care for me.

01:01:09.941 --> 01:01:12.609
I just knew the streets
of Detroit wouldn't.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:16.238
I'm telling you, man,
I'd have died out there.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.073
Same here.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:22.161
The streets of Galveston
killed my pa and my little brother.

01:01:22.162 --> 01:01:25.706
Plus I wanted to get out
and see the world,

01:01:25.707 --> 01:01:27.082
chase some foreign tail.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.878
I second that.

01:01:30.879 --> 01:01:34.173
Hey, you take notes.

01:01:34.174 --> 01:01:37.009
Adventure, sex...

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.803
you put that in your book,
it'll sell like hot cakes.

01:01:39.804 --> 01:01:42.139
We might even have
a new New Testament!

01:01:58.865 --> 01:02:00.616
What's going on over there!

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:03.047
Get in the raft!
Get in the raft!

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.622
Get the men out of the water!
Get on the raft!

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:11.585
Everybody out of the water!
Get out of the water!

01:02:11.586 --> 01:02:14.755
<i>You men, out of the water!
What are you doing?</i>

01:02:14.756 --> 01:02:17.007
<i>You stop swimming,
you get out of the water!</i>

01:02:17.008 --> 01:02:19.778
Where in the hell's he going?

01:02:22.555 --> 01:02:23.945
What happened?

01:02:57.799 --> 01:03:00.300
May the Lord bless you
and keep you.

01:03:00.301 --> 01:03:02.741
May he shine his face upon you.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:07.365
Amen.

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:39.818
Dear God, take my soul...

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.318
Thank you, God.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:03.864
Agh! Get off me,
God damn it!

01:04:03.865 --> 01:04:05.908
- There's something out there!
- Sharks!

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:09.119
Theodore, Theodore,
have you see any other group?

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.413
I was in a big group,
100 or more of us.

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.791
- Which direction?
- That way!

01:04:13.792 --> 01:04:16.710
Son of a bitch!

01:04:22.884 --> 01:04:24.885
Peel that open and inject him.

01:04:24.886 --> 01:04:26.387
I'll just head out
a little ways.

01:04:26.388 --> 01:04:28.764
I won't be gone long.
See if I can find them.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:32.768
No, wait, Captain!
Don't leave us!

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.688
Talk to him, distract him!

01:04:35.689 --> 01:04:38.774
- Keep him calm!
- Wait, sir!

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:41.110
Sir! Captain!

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.711
Help me.

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:03.132
<i>Amazing grace</i>

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:08.470
How sweet the sound

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:11.307
That saved

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.809
A wretch

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:18.063
Like me

01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:20.983
I once was lost...

01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:31.452
It's okay...

01:05:33.288 --> 01:05:37.499
Oh, Christ have mercy on me!

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.085
"He wandered into the mess hall
gleam in his eyes,

01:05:40.086 --> 01:05:43.088
rolled the dice, and said,
'Lady luck is a friend of mine.

01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:44.965
Open up and let it shine.'"

01:05:44.966 --> 01:05:47.092
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading.

01:05:47.093 --> 01:05:49.094
- What?
- Reading!

01:05:49.095 --> 01:05:52.014
You're gonna have to do better than that.
I'm fucking dying!

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.807
Okay, okay!

01:05:53.808 --> 01:05:57.019
- Do better than that.
- I'm sorry!

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.854
"The first time I saw her,

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:01.148
it was on Market Street
in San Francisco.

01:06:01.149 --> 01:06:03.484
You could spot
her red dress a mile away."

01:06:03.485 --> 01:06:05.235
Was it a tight dress or what?

01:06:05.236 --> 01:06:07.446
Sure, sure, tight dress.

01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:10.449
So tight, leaving little
to the imagination.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.159
Did you write that?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.536
Yeah, it's my book.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:18.267
That's good.
Read it again.

01:06:22.128 --> 01:06:25.130
"The first time I saw..."
Sir, please, stay with me.

01:06:25.131 --> 01:06:27.051
I'm going to read you,
I'm going to read you, okay?

01:06:27.052 --> 01:06:31.303
Okay?
"She was so...

01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:34.556
She was safe.
She knew.

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:38.310
I will not be
defined by what I face,

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:40.331
but how I face it."

01:06:47.278 --> 01:06:48.570
<i>"It was as if she was
a fallen angel,"</i>

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.072
<i>Angel in the skies?</i>

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.533
<i>"sent to watch over him.</i>

01:06:52.534 --> 01:06:55.327
<i>'Kiss me with your eyes, '
she teased.</i>

01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:59.081
<i>Every molecule in this sailor's
body ached for her touch."</i>

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.916
Tie us together!

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:04.378
Found more men and supplies.

01:07:04.379 --> 01:07:06.046
These two say they drifted away

01:07:06.047 --> 01:07:08.882
from the same group
as you, Theodore.

01:07:08.883 --> 01:07:10.300
How you men doing?

01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:11.927
This young man
is telling a story,

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.430
making this old sailor blush,
McVay.

01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:20.102
So go on, man,
does he take her or what?

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.623
Carry on.

01:07:24.316 --> 01:07:26.942
"'I'll give you all the love
this life allows, '

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:29.987
she whispered, and with that,

01:07:29.988 --> 01:07:34.074
<i>she spread herself beneath him,
finally guiding him home."</i>

01:07:39.331 --> 01:07:41.290
<i>"Dearest Louise,</i>

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.625
<i>it's been two days at sea</i>

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.128
<i>and no sign of rescue.</i>

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:49.298
<i>I fear I have let the men down.</i>

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:53.093
<i>I try to find little things
to give them hope."</i>

01:07:53.094 --> 01:07:55.095
<i>- Spam.
- "But even that is in short supply."</i>

01:07:55.096 --> 01:07:56.986
House specialty.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:08.497
God damn.

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:11.487
This...

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:13.489
baboon ass...

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:15.510
tastes like
a two-inch steak.

01:08:20.537 --> 01:08:23.957
We'll open one can a day.

01:08:23.957 --> 01:08:26.502
Splash some seawater
on your head,

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:30.089
let the breeze cool you down.

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:35.594
Don't drink it.
It'll make you crazy.

01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:40.515
<i>"It is bordering on impossible
that a plane would spot us.</i>

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:43.685
<i>But still,
at the slightest sound,</i>

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:45.247
<i>I look up to the sky."</i>

01:09:10.421 --> 01:09:11.714
<i>Shut up a minute.</i>

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:14.508
<i>Why, that old tightwad!</i>

01:09:14.509 --> 01:09:16.093
<i>He'd steal flies
from a blind spider!</i>

01:09:16.094 --> 01:09:17.386
<i>Yeah, well, he just died</i>

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.429
<i>and left you $500,000 bucks.</i>

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:19.700
<i>$500,000?</i>

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:32.192
I taught her
a couple of dance moves.

01:09:32.193 --> 01:09:36.303
Man...
she sure can dance.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.201
Clara's the cutest thing, man.

01:09:41.202 --> 01:09:42.618
Do you know what she
used to call me, Bama?

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.412
No.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.394
I don't want to hear it.

01:09:48.209 --> 01:09:50.002
I told you,

01:09:50.002 --> 01:09:51.443
not in the raft, shitbird!

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.319
<i>What the hell?</i>

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:12.691
Stop! Stop!

01:10:12.692 --> 01:10:14.422
You ain't scaring 'em off!

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.090
You're ringing the dinner bell.

01:10:22.327 --> 01:10:25.788
I couldn't use my Annapolis
ring as a fishing lure

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.457
because we need it
for good luck,

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.251
but I could use my wedding ring,

01:10:31.252 --> 01:10:33.796
because my wife
would understand.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:38.092
You see, she likes to fish.

01:10:38.093 --> 01:10:40.573
Might even like it
more than I do.

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:48.227
How'd you guys meet?

01:10:48.228 --> 01:10:49.812
You aren't going to use this

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.653
for one of your creative
stories, are you?

01:10:51.654 --> 01:10:55.150
No, sir.

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:59.655
At the Chevy Chase Club
outside of Washington, DC.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.740
The band was playing
"Pennies From Heaven,"

01:11:01.741 --> 01:11:03.283
and I saw her.

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:06.894
She was singing to herself.

01:11:17.298 --> 01:11:19.148
She's everything to me.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.120
Well, I'm sure you miss
your family, too.

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:37.735
Have you ever told her?

01:11:37.736 --> 01:11:39.528
How you just told me?

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:42.323
Told her what?

01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:43.684
How you feel about her.

01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:48.391
I try to write to her.

01:11:50.123 --> 01:11:52.166
Words don't come
even easily for me...

01:11:52.167 --> 01:11:55.336
Not yet! God!
I got a little boy I never seen!

01:11:55.337 --> 01:11:58.380
No! No angels!
No, no angels!

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:01.550
Please, please, God!

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.719
Hold it tight.
Hold it tight.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.890
<i>Don't let me die here
without seeing him!</i>

01:12:05.891 --> 01:12:08.223
<i>- Hold my hand.
- I don't wanna die!</i>

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:10.954
<i>Don't let me die
without letting me see my...</i>

01:13:26.344 --> 01:13:29.614
Captain. Captain?

01:13:33.351 --> 01:13:34.911
It's okay.

01:13:37.272 --> 01:13:38.792
The fleet is coming.

01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:45.669
Get some rest.

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.720
Attention!

01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:11.680
If anyone was coming to save us,

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.307
they would've been here by now.

01:14:13.308 --> 01:14:17.519
An island has been spotted
a few miles away.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.021
That's impossible.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.482
We're somewhere
in the Philippine Sea.

01:14:21.483 --> 01:14:23.651
You don't know where we are.

01:14:23.652 --> 01:14:25.361
We're going to catch a current,

01:14:25.362 --> 01:14:26.820
and we're gonna ride it over
to that island.

01:14:26.821 --> 01:14:28.739
The captain would want us
to stay together.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.492
The Captain is dead,
you understand?

01:14:31.493 --> 01:14:32.910
I am in charge now.

01:14:32.911 --> 01:14:34.828
<i>I need a few good men</i>

01:14:34.829 --> 01:14:38.349
who are tired of being
shark bait to join me now!

01:14:39.834 --> 01:14:41.564
You, come on over.

01:14:42.587 --> 01:14:44.838
You, come on over.

01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:48.489
Obviously, we can't take
anyone who's bleeding.

01:14:50.595 --> 01:14:52.930
I'm sorry, chap.

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:55.661
I promised my mama
I'd come home safe.

01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:04.066
Come on, men, swim on over.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:08.404
And, Waxman, I'm going to leave you
in charge of the wounded.

01:15:08.405 --> 01:15:10.322
And those two
troublemakers over there

01:15:10.323 --> 01:15:11.991
<i>you seem to have such
an affinity for.</i>

01:15:11.992 --> 01:15:15.995
What about leaving us
some supplies? Sir.

01:15:15.996 --> 01:15:18.455
Oh, we'll leave you
with that extra raft,

01:15:18.456 --> 01:15:20.916
<i>Don't you worry.
We'll send help.</i>

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:23.043
What about you, Marine?

01:15:23.044 --> 01:15:26.630
I'm will stay with the padre.

01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:28.465
Very well, then.

01:15:28.466 --> 01:15:30.092
Everybody grab an oar.
Let's paddle.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:34.430
All in unison now, let's go.
I know we're tired.

01:15:34.431 --> 01:15:36.432
The island's over there.

01:15:36.433 --> 01:15:37.953
All right, God bless.

01:15:46.568 --> 01:15:49.958
Row! Row! Come on, men!

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:02.041
<i>Mike?</i>

01:16:02.042 --> 01:16:04.835
<i>Mike!</i>

01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:07.546
<i>Mike, are you out there?!</i>

01:16:07.547 --> 01:16:09.965
<i>We're here!</i>

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:14.428
Bama, Bama, wake up,
they're here. Bama!

01:16:14.429 --> 01:16:17.139
- What?
- We're getting out of here.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.660
They're here.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:23.145
That's Clara! That's Clara!
That's Clara!

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.155
Calm down! Hey, hey!
You're just hallucinating.

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:35.532
Calm down.
Hey, calm down.

01:16:35.533 --> 01:16:37.618
You're just hallucinating.

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:39.995
Calm down, buddy.

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:42.016
I love her, Mike.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.557
I love Clara!

01:16:53.885 --> 01:16:55.775
I always have.

01:16:57.514 --> 01:17:01.016
Since Sunday school
at First Baptist, and...

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:06.157
and I... I was gonna
make something of myself.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.700
What's that?

01:17:21.913 --> 01:17:24.498
Gotta be sharks!
Get in the raft! Get in the raft!

01:17:24.499 --> 01:17:26.269
It's gonna flip.
Go on the other side.

01:17:44.144 --> 01:17:47.062
Damn, that stinks man.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:49.690
Probably been dead
for a good two hours or so.

01:17:49.691 --> 01:17:51.671
Go on, take his vest.

01:17:54.654 --> 01:17:56.655
Oh, jeez,
that's the kid, Theodore.

01:17:56.656 --> 01:18:00.951
That's his book, man.

01:18:00.952 --> 01:18:04.079
Shark took his
poor head clean off.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.042
You think it's just luck,
who lives and who dies?

01:18:08.043 --> 01:18:10.063
It was his time.

01:18:12.839 --> 01:18:16.258
I'm hoping that
I'm too bad for Heaven

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.969
and too good for Hell.

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:21.180
<i>I think people make up religion</i>

01:18:21.181 --> 01:18:24.600
to make themselves feel better.

01:18:24.601 --> 01:18:26.769
Can't be a God,

01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:30.773
not with the stuff that I seen.

01:18:30.774 --> 01:18:33.525
At least, not one that cares.

01:18:33.526 --> 01:18:36.779
Death, evil...

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:41.116
I saw a man sacrifice
his life for another man.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:44.203
I ain't telling you
what to believe, brother.

01:18:44.204 --> 01:18:47.790
I... I just know there's
a lot of good in the world,

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:50.042
and...

01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:52.127
I want to get back to it.

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:55.631
- You said your girl?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:55.632 --> 01:19:00.761
Is it true she's the
Michigan state arm wrestling champion?

01:19:00.762 --> 01:19:02.054
Two years in a row.

01:19:10.647 --> 01:19:12.667
Don't get out of line with her.

01:19:37.799 --> 01:19:40.319
Do you think this is going
to mess up my dance game?

01:19:42.679 --> 01:19:44.722
Well...

01:19:44.723 --> 01:19:46.348
it's called the Lindy hop.

01:19:54.691 --> 01:19:57.881
What if she doesn't believe
I bought her a ring?

01:19:59.738 --> 01:20:04.241
Then you'll get her another one.
And you'll give it to her.

01:20:04.242 --> 01:20:08.012
She's great...
a great girl, right?

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:12.916
Take care of her.

01:20:12.917 --> 01:20:15.669
- What?
- Promise me, Bam.

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.921
Take care of her.

01:20:17.922 --> 01:20:19.131
Hey, you stop.

01:20:19.132 --> 01:20:21.782
Listen, Bam,
remember on the ship?

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.820
You told me to slow down.

01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:31.123
I didn't listen.

01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:35.959
And I grabbed the hatch.

01:20:37.734 --> 01:20:41.195
I burned my hands, Bam.

01:20:41.196 --> 01:20:46.867
Melted my skin.
I never listen.

01:20:46.868 --> 01:20:49.248
You were doing what you thought
you were supposed to be doing.

01:20:49.249 --> 01:20:51.005
And I got her in trouble.

01:20:54.834 --> 01:20:57.169
That's why...

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:58.980
the ring.

01:21:04.094 --> 01:21:06.204
A nice girl like that.

01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:23.250
Mike? Mike?

01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:34.415
Mike?

01:21:34.416 --> 01:21:35.766
Hey.

01:21:39.754 --> 01:21:41.864
Don't be dead.

01:22:23.882 --> 01:22:25.862
Hey, we got company.

01:22:32.349 --> 01:22:34.119
West.

01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.534
<i>They're all dead.</i>

01:22:44.535 --> 01:22:46.403
<i>Standish. Cavanaugh.</i>

01:22:46.404 --> 01:22:48.134
Sharks everywhere.

01:22:49.366 --> 01:22:53.160
West, you're okay.

01:22:53.161 --> 01:22:55.871
Forgive me, chap.

01:22:55.872 --> 01:22:58.332
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:22:58.333 --> 01:23:00.042
- You're safe.
- I'm so sorry.

01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:01.313
You're safe.

01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:06.978
No!

01:23:13.515 --> 01:23:15.849
Get out of the water!

01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:17.851
Swim! Swim!

01:23:20.188 --> 01:23:21.998
Get out!

01:23:40.917 --> 01:23:43.168
No!

01:23:43.169 --> 01:23:45.359
God damn it!

01:23:55.598 --> 01:23:59.101
<i>"It is the fourth day,</i>

01:23:59.102 --> 01:24:01.332
<i>and many men
have simply given up.</i>

01:24:06.026 --> 01:24:09.445
<i>I've seen the strongest boys,</i>

01:24:09.446 --> 01:24:12.281
<i>their lives full of promise,</i>

01:24:12.282 --> 01:24:16.142
<i>succumb to our horrible
circumstances.</i>

<i>Others of us feel as though
we are losing our minds."</i>

01:26:52.484 --> 01:26:55.569
Garrison.

01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:57.710
Garrison, is that...
is that a hallucination?

01:27:00.367 --> 01:27:02.493
That son of a bitch is close.
Can you see it?

01:27:02.494 --> 01:27:04.787
Do you see that?

01:27:04.788 --> 01:27:08.707
Help!
Over here! Over here!

01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:11.502
I can't see.
I ca... I can't see.

01:27:11.503 --> 01:27:14.063
I can't see any...
I can't see anything.

01:27:16.091 --> 01:27:17.508
Wave right here.
He's close.

01:27:17.509 --> 01:27:20.489
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

01:27:22.681 --> 01:27:25.099
I'm getting nothing
but static, sir.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.309
It's that antenna.
I thought you had it looked at.

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:28.540
I did.

01:27:34.442 --> 01:27:36.252
God damn it.

01:27:39.447 --> 01:27:41.297
Look down!

01:27:48.748 --> 01:27:50.416
We're above something.

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:52.376
I think it's an oil spill
from a Japanese sub.

01:27:52.377 --> 01:27:54.767
<i>Let's circle back.
Get ready to drop.</i>

01:28:03.555 --> 01:28:06.515
He saw us!
He saw us!

01:28:06.516 --> 01:28:08.559
He saw us!

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.853
Drop below 50!
Hang on!

01:28:10.854 --> 01:28:13.564
Are you sure it was
a Japanese submarine, sir?

01:28:13.565 --> 01:28:16.692
Who else would be out here?
You got eyes on this?

01:28:16.693 --> 01:28:17.883
On my go!

01:28:23.575 --> 01:28:27.453
Are you...
seeing this, skipper?

01:28:27.454 --> 01:28:31.248
You seeing...
seeing this?

01:28:31.249 --> 01:28:32.639
It doesn't see us.

01:28:34.753 --> 01:28:37.153
Sees the oil.

01:28:40.884 --> 01:28:44.803
<i>And drop in three, two, one.</i>

01:28:44.804 --> 01:28:46.574
Wait! Wait!!

01:28:49.309 --> 01:28:52.353
<i>There's got to be 100 men out
there spread out over miles.</i>

01:28:52.354 --> 01:28:53.664
<i>Get on the radio now!</i>

01:28:58.193 --> 01:29:00.611
<i>Hey, look, this is Gambler 17.</i>

01:29:00.612 --> 01:29:02.696
We are flying over hundreds
of boys in the water.

01:29:02.697 --> 01:29:06.337
I repeat, we are flying
over hundreds of boys in the water.

01:29:10.622 --> 01:29:12.581
<i>Amber 17, copy this.</i>

01:29:12.582 --> 01:29:14.416
<i>We have to follow protocol.</i>

01:29:14.417 --> 01:29:16.347
<i>The Japanese could be out there.</i>

01:29:20.715 --> 01:29:24.468
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
Sir, Lieutenant!

01:29:24.469 --> 01:29:25.859
Lieutenant, sir!

01:29:28.264 --> 01:29:29.765
We just got a call in.

01:29:29.766 --> 01:29:31.725
There's something in the water.

01:29:31.726 --> 01:29:35.604
Could be the plane
we're looking for, sir.

01:29:35.605 --> 01:29:39.441
Find all the water we have,
food, too, medical supplies.

01:29:39.442 --> 01:29:41.502
God knows how long
they've been down there.

01:29:59.629 --> 01:30:03.716
Do you see what I see?
There are men everywhere!

01:30:03.717 --> 01:30:05.259
The Japs must have sunk a ship.

01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.760
Japs might still be out there

01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:09.241
waiting to sink any ship
that comes along!

01:30:11.308 --> 01:30:13.600
Those boys need help now.

01:30:13.601 --> 01:30:16.937
Sir, request position
permission for a no-no.

01:30:16.938 --> 01:30:18.522
<i>Negative!</i>

01:30:18.523 --> 01:30:20.983
<i>Do not land that plane
on open ocean!</i>

01:30:20.984 --> 01:30:23.004
You can't risk
that kind of damage.

01:30:24.946 --> 01:30:26.780
I'm gonna land this plane.

01:30:26.781 --> 01:30:28.831
Land the damn plane, Lieutenant.

01:30:28.832 --> 01:30:30.425
Hang on!

01:30:42.297 --> 01:30:45.633
Holy shit, these guys
are doing a water landing.

01:30:45.634 --> 01:30:48.594
Were almost out of fuel, sir.
We have to go.

01:30:48.595 --> 01:30:50.445
<i>10-4,
heading back to base.</i>

01:30:52.682 --> 01:30:57.853
He saw us!
He saw us!

01:32:46.963 --> 01:32:48.773
<i>Taking on water!</i>

01:32:51.635 --> 01:32:52.935
Holy shit.

01:32:58.767 --> 01:33:01.143
- Pick up the single swimmers.
- Lieutenant,

01:33:01.144 --> 01:33:02.654
wouldn't it be faster
to pick up the ones in groups?

01:33:02.655 --> 01:33:04.480
It'd be a hell of a lot faster,

01:33:04.481 --> 01:33:06.482
but they stand a better chance
of survival in big groups.

01:33:06.483 --> 01:33:09.485
Hey, son, what's your name?
What happened here?

01:33:09.486 --> 01:33:11.820
Brian Smithwick.

01:33:11.821 --> 01:33:17.091
<i>Signalman first class aboard

01:33:18.745 --> 01:33:20.037
<i>Even out!
Straight!</i>

01:33:20.038 --> 01:33:21.789
Lieutenant,
the cabin's getting full.

01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.499
Get some more on the wing.
Don't forget this tail.

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.085
We can put some on there.
Watch that cleat!

01:33:26.086 --> 01:33:27.503
We're going home!

01:33:27.504 --> 01:33:28.754
Are you serious...

01:33:31.591 --> 01:33:33.926
Hey, wait, wait!

01:33:33.927 --> 01:33:35.552
It's our skipper.

01:33:35.553 --> 01:33:37.573
Thank you...

01:33:39.766 --> 01:33:42.518
for... landing!

01:33:42.519 --> 01:33:44.159
We got room for a few more.

01:33:46.564 --> 01:33:48.983
I'm okay!

01:33:48.984 --> 01:33:51.443
Get my men...

01:33:51.444 --> 01:33:52.964
out of the water!

01:34:06.084 --> 01:34:08.210
<i>It's the USS Indianapolis.</i>

01:34:08.211 --> 01:34:10.462
That can't be.

01:34:10.463 --> 01:34:11.547
It shouldn't be, but it is.

01:34:11.548 --> 01:34:13.173
This is a class-A
clusterfuck.

01:34:13.174 --> 01:34:15.217
<i>Somebody is gonna pay for this.</i>

01:34:15.218 --> 01:34:17.720
If I were you,
I'd send every ship you got

01:34:17.721 --> 01:34:19.805
before the sharks
get at the rest of them.

01:34:19.806 --> 01:34:21.807
<i>I don't know how many more
I fit on this plane.</i>

01:34:21.808 --> 01:34:22.891
You're putting them
on the plane?

01:34:22.892 --> 01:34:24.852
You'll never get off the water!

01:34:24.853 --> 01:34:27.521
You kidding me?
The plane's shot, Hoss. It's shot to shit.

01:34:27.522 --> 01:34:29.773
We're taking on water.
We're lucky to be afloat.

01:34:29.774 --> 01:34:32.244
You don't want to consider
sending a ship for these boys,

01:34:32.245 --> 01:34:34.585
<i>send one for me.</i>

01:34:38.074 --> 01:34:41.618
<i>"I don't understand
why it took so long.</i>

01:34:41.619 --> 01:34:44.830
<i>At last relief came.</i>

01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:47.082
<i>There wasn't enough room
on the plane</i>

01:34:47.083 --> 01:34:52.087
<i>for all the survivors,
but soon the ships followed,</i>

01:34:52.088 --> 01:34:55.507
<i>the Bassett,
the Ringness, the Talbot,</i>

01:34:55.508 --> 01:34:57.968
<i>the Register, the Dulfilho,</i>

01:34:57.969 --> 01:34:59.859
<i>and the Cecil J. Doyle."</i>

01:35:12.942 --> 01:35:16.111
That's exactly what I want.

01:35:16.112 --> 01:35:18.781
Our hero ship that delivered
the bomb in record time

01:35:18.782 --> 01:35:21.241
got sunk four days ago.

01:35:21.242 --> 01:35:23.302
What?
How many survived?

01:35:25.246 --> 01:35:27.206
317.

01:35:27.207 --> 01:35:31.085
879 men lost their lives.

01:35:31.086 --> 01:35:33.128
Command screwed the pooch
on three SOS calls

01:35:33.129 --> 01:35:34.713
<i>from the Indianapolis.</i>

01:35:34.714 --> 01:35:36.590
That's not including
an intercepted message

01:35:36.591 --> 01:35:39.593
from the Japanese I-58
that did that sinking.

01:35:39.594 --> 01:35:41.095
Son of a bitch.

01:35:41.096 --> 01:35:43.222
The Japanese
on the verge of surrender,

01:35:43.223 --> 01:35:46.016
<i>and that's due in part
to the Indianapolis.</i>

01:35:46.017 --> 01:35:49.061
I don't want to hear about
the sinking in the press

01:35:49.062 --> 01:35:50.688
till I'm damn good and ready.

01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:53.232
Jap surrender
we'll just mention in a news dump.

01:35:53.233 --> 01:35:55.152
Bury it below
some positive news.

01:35:55.153 --> 01:35:57.069
There will still be
an investigation.

01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.320
Too many lives were lost.

01:35:58.321 --> 01:35:59.863
With the Pearl Harbor
inquiry going on,

01:35:59.864 --> 01:36:01.907
now ain't the time
to be raising questions

01:36:01.908 --> 01:36:04.076
about military incompetence.

01:36:04.077 --> 01:36:06.787
Or you just suggest
we indict the Big Blue Dick.

01:36:06.788 --> 01:36:10.916
No, I'm saying the press
and the public

01:36:10.917 --> 01:36:13.767
will want somebody's
head on a platter.

01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:22.094
Then we'll give 'em someone.

01:36:22.095 --> 01:36:25.681
<i>I want to go home!</i>

01:36:25.682 --> 01:36:27.782
<i>I just want to go home!</i>

01:36:31.187 --> 01:36:34.940
<i>Where's the doctor?!
I need a doctor!</i>

01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:36.775
<i>Just lie back, sir.</i>

01:36:36.776 --> 01:36:40.070
- Signalman.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:40.071 --> 01:36:43.801
Did your friend make it?
The boy you jumped over with?

01:37:04.387 --> 01:37:07.890
<i>"Through some terrible
twist of fate,</i>

01:37:07.891 --> 01:37:11.226
<i>it turns out that I am
one of the only officers</i>

01:37:11.227 --> 01:37:13.312
<i>that survived.</i>

01:37:13.313 --> 01:37:16.899
<i>Many of those that died
were our dear friends.</i>

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.984
<i>It will be a tremendous
burden for you</i>

01:37:18.985 --> 01:37:21.111
<i>to have to tell their wives</i>

01:37:21.112 --> 01:37:23.238
<i>that all their husbands perished</i>

01:37:23.239 --> 01:37:28.049
<i>while yours,
the Captain, lived."</i>

01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:32.039
<i>Anybody seen Cavanaugh?</i>

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.918
<i>Did Cavanaugh make it?</i>

01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:37.378
<i>What about Standish?</i>

01:37:37.379 --> 01:37:40.019
Garrison,
9:00. 9:00.

01:37:44.094 --> 01:37:45.364
Stick your hand out.

01:37:47.931 --> 01:37:50.724
It's Theodore, you dummy.

01:37:53.269 --> 01:37:55.896
You little turd!

01:37:55.897 --> 01:37:58.941
We found your book
on a dead guy, man.

01:37:58.942 --> 01:38:00.901
I gave it to a sailor
for comfort.

01:38:00.902 --> 01:38:03.821
I ain't ready to go down
God's toilet bowl yet.

01:38:03.822 --> 01:38:05.802
<i>I missed you guys!</i>

01:38:14.749 --> 01:38:16.458
I found that...

01:38:16.459 --> 01:38:19.086
in the gutter...

01:38:19.087 --> 01:38:21.297
two weeks ago.

01:38:21.298 --> 01:38:23.148
You believe that?

01:38:24.926 --> 01:38:26.760
Thanks.

01:38:26.761 --> 01:38:30.264
Don't... don't thank me.
I was going to come here.

01:38:30.265 --> 01:38:34.810
I was going to tell you that
I didn't know whose it was.

01:38:34.811 --> 01:38:37.187
But I knew.

01:38:37.188 --> 01:38:40.316
I knew it was D'Antonio's.

01:38:40.317 --> 01:38:43.417
I was gonna pawn it
to pay some debt.

01:38:46.823 --> 01:38:52.453
I'm not just like some
everyday normal kind of asshole, Bama.

01:38:52.454 --> 01:38:54.264
I'm a special kind.

01:38:57.167 --> 01:38:59.501
I'm sorry.

01:38:59.502 --> 01:39:01.902
I'm so sorry.

01:39:14.017 --> 01:39:15.893
<i>The war is over.</i>

01:39:15.894 --> 01:39:19.229
<i>Atomic bombs have been dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,</i>

01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:22.524
<i>and Japan has surrendered
to the Allied powers.</i>

01:39:22.525 --> 01:39:24.985
<i>"The packages we delivered</i>

01:39:24.986 --> 01:39:27.863
<i>worked
with devastating accuracy.</i>

01:39:27.864 --> 01:39:30.324
<i>The men of the USS Indianapolis
returned home..."</i>

01:39:30.325 --> 01:39:32.785
<i>A joyous day indeed.</i>

01:39:32.786 --> 01:39:34.536
<i>Tickertape parades
are the order of the day</i>

01:39:34.537 --> 01:39:36.914
<i>for all our brave American GIs,</i>

01:39:36.915 --> 01:39:38.874
<i>both those who came back</i>

01:39:38.875 --> 01:39:41.043
<i>and those courageous boys
who have given their lives.</i>

01:39:41.044 --> 01:39:43.234
<i>"Not all of them
with good news."</i>

01:39:51.805 --> 01:39:55.182
<i>"For them,
the war was over."</i>

01:39:55.183 --> 01:39:57.267
Mom!

01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:10.906
<i>"But for me, the battle
was just beginning."</i>

01:40:10.907 --> 01:40:12.032
I'm here.

01:40:28.133 --> 01:40:30.926
<i>My boy. My baby boy.</i>

01:40:30.927 --> 01:40:33.027
I'll never get to see him!

01:40:56.161 --> 01:40:58.078
McVay residence.

01:40:58.079 --> 01:41:00.956
<i>I hope you burn in hell
for what you did.</i>

01:41:00.957 --> 01:41:03.177
Just hang up, Charlie.

01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:06.441
<i>Burn in hell!</i>

01:41:09.299 --> 01:41:11.967
We need you back, Charlie.

01:41:11.968 --> 01:41:16.221
Me, your boy...

01:41:16.222 --> 01:41:18.307
we need you.

01:41:18.308 --> 01:41:20.976
A lot of boys needed me.

01:41:20.977 --> 01:41:23.247
You did all you could.

01:41:33.239 --> 01:41:35.329
<i>I hear you got your promotion.</i>

01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:37.910
I turned it down.

01:41:37.911 --> 01:41:40.663
I'm moving to Washington, DC,
going to law school.

01:41:40.664 --> 01:41:43.170
Might even help my uncle
on his next campaign.

01:41:43.171 --> 01:41:46.335
Well, I wish you
all the luck in the world, Brian.

01:41:46.336 --> 01:41:48.170
You deserve it.

01:41:48.171 --> 01:41:52.925
Clara, I, um...

01:41:52.926 --> 01:41:55.427
I've been through
just about the scariest thing

01:41:55.428 --> 01:41:58.263
that a man could face
out there on the ocean.

01:41:58.264 --> 01:42:00.099
I don't know that
that's something

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.017
I'm ever going to get over.

01:42:02.018 --> 01:42:03.352
You see, I've been afraid

01:42:03.353 --> 01:42:04.645
to live my life to the fullest.

01:42:04.646 --> 01:42:07.564
I've been afraid a long time.

01:42:07.565 --> 01:42:10.442
<i>Afraid of what?</i>

01:42:12.362 --> 01:42:16.882
Just, well,
not being good enough.

01:42:17.534 --> 01:42:19.576
Yeah.

01:42:19.577 --> 01:42:22.538
About being rejected.

01:42:22.539 --> 01:42:26.333
Rejected?
By who?

01:42:26.334 --> 01:42:29.503
By you, Clara.

01:42:29.504 --> 01:42:34.574
I have been in love with you
since the day that we met.

01:42:37.053 --> 01:42:38.554
And I, um...

01:42:41.558 --> 01:42:43.517
Marriage?

01:42:43.518 --> 01:42:46.228
Brian...

01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:47.563
Mike and I are having...

01:42:47.564 --> 01:42:50.607
A baby, yeah, I know.

01:42:50.608 --> 01:42:53.652
But you see,
Mike was like a brother to me,

01:42:53.653 --> 01:42:56.739
and that baby
is going to need a father.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.158
<i>And so I would be honored</i>

01:42:59.159 --> 01:43:02.049
if you would at least
consider being my wife.

01:43:04.706 --> 01:43:09.043
You don't gotta love me back
or anything like that.

01:43:09.044 --> 01:43:12.588
And we might never
be as rich as your folks.

01:43:12.589 --> 01:43:16.759
But we could start
a fresh life in DC.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.011
I know you already got one ring,

01:43:19.012 --> 01:43:20.832
but I thought maybe
two was better than one.

01:43:25.602 --> 01:43:28.562
After all he's been through,
they're putting him on trial.

01:43:28.563 --> 01:43:30.648
Sounds like they're
looking for a scapegoat.

01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:34.276
Louise, it...
it's complicated.

01:43:34.277 --> 01:43:36.737
What's complicated?
Admiral.

01:43:36.738 --> 01:43:38.113
Captain.

01:43:38.114 --> 01:43:39.698
Would you gentlemen
like some tea?

01:43:39.699 --> 01:43:42.701
Thank you, Louise.

01:43:42.702 --> 01:43:44.122
<i>Bumped into the submarine,</i>

01:43:44.123 --> 01:43:45.746
<i>which had fired the torpedoes.</i>

01:43:45.747 --> 01:43:47.790
<i>Members of the
tanker's crew related...</i>

01:43:49.542 --> 01:43:51.630
<i>The President
withheld immediate comment...</i>

01:43:51.631 --> 01:43:54.421
<i>Charlie, as far as
they were concerned,</i>

01:43:54.422 --> 01:43:55.801
<i>you were on a secret mission</i>

01:43:55.802 --> 01:43:57.383
<i>under the command
of the President.</i>

01:43:59.302 --> 01:44:04.139
<i>And since their orders were
to never announce arrivals,</i>

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.557
<i>they'll argue that they</i>

01:44:05.558 --> 01:44:09.078
were not supposed to announce
non-arrivals either.

01:44:11.106 --> 01:44:12.690
So what now?

01:44:12.691 --> 01:44:15.211
I found outside counsel.

01:44:25.495 --> 01:44:26.845
What I'm about to tell you...

01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:31.431
can't ever leave this room.

01:44:37.841 --> 01:44:42.261
Four days before your ship
was sunk by the Japanese...

01:44:42.262 --> 01:44:46.598
there was another US ship
in those same waters.

01:44:46.599 --> 01:44:48.119
<i>The USS Underhill.</i>

01:44:51.187 --> 01:44:55.127
She was torpedoed...
and sunk.

01:44:57.819 --> 01:45:02.489
Point being, you should
have had an escort.

01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:06.118
You should have had sonar.

01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:08.299
Charlie, I am so sorry.

01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:13.853
The trial will be in Washington.

01:45:23.637 --> 01:45:25.137
This one right here, fellas,

01:45:25.138 --> 01:45:27.348
is to being back
on solid ground.

01:45:27.349 --> 01:45:30.517
To never seeing another shark again.

01:45:30.518 --> 01:45:34.730
To wishing our Captain luck
in this bullshit trial.

01:45:34.731 --> 01:45:37.524
To all the good men
we lost at sea.

01:45:37.525 --> 01:45:40.277
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:45:41.279 --> 01:45:43.238
Excuse me, boys.

01:45:43.239 --> 01:45:44.615
See something you like, Alvin?

01:45:44.616 --> 01:45:47.660
Oh, no, yeah, no I...

01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:50.204
I recognize one of those rings.

01:45:50.205 --> 01:45:53.749
But, uh, not the other one.

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:56.752
I got it from my husband, Bama.

01:45:56.753 --> 01:45:59.613
Your husband.
Oh.

01:46:04.761 --> 01:46:08.180
You got something
you want to say, Alvin?

01:46:08.181 --> 01:46:10.265
Isn't that D'Antonio's girl?

01:46:10.266 --> 01:46:14.770
Yeah, she was. So?

01:46:14.771 --> 01:46:16.605
I mean, a fella married

01:46:16.606 --> 01:46:18.607
his buddy's pregnant girlfriend?

01:46:18.608 --> 01:46:20.651
That's...

01:46:20.652 --> 01:46:22.653
well, he's a better man than me.

01:46:22.654 --> 01:46:26.281
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

01:46:26.282 --> 01:46:28.784
Hey, McVay's trial starts
at 0900.

01:46:28.785 --> 01:46:30.685
Think we ought a be there
about an hour early.

01:46:35.375 --> 01:46:36.792
<i>Sir! Sir!</i>

01:46:36.793 --> 01:46:38.627
<i>Are you expecting
to be court martialed?</i>

01:46:38.628 --> 01:46:41.380
<i>Sir, answer the question!</i>

01:46:41.381 --> 01:46:42.965
<i>Do you feel
personally responsible</i>

01:46:42.966 --> 01:46:44.726
<i>for the loss
of your men? Captain!</i>

01:46:50.473 --> 01:46:53.350
Captain McVay,
you're being accused

01:46:53.351 --> 01:46:55.644
of hazarding your ship
by failing to zigzag

01:46:55.645 --> 01:46:58.814
as an evasive maneuver
and failing to abandon ship

01:46:58.815 --> 01:47:01.317
in a timely manner.

01:47:01.318 --> 01:47:04.737
For the benefit of the court,
how do you plead?

01:47:04.738 --> 01:47:05.904
Not guilty.

01:47:10.493 --> 01:47:11.910
And when the ship was hit,

01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:14.747
did you hear any directives
from your Captain?

01:47:14.748 --> 01:47:17.916
I went to the bridge.
Commander Cavanaugh was there.

01:47:17.917 --> 01:47:19.335
He told me that Captain McVay

01:47:19.336 --> 01:47:21.462
had given the order
to abandon ship.

01:47:21.463 --> 01:47:24.506
But you never got the order
from Captain McVay.

01:47:24.507 --> 01:47:26.884
- Not initially, but...
- Thank you, sir, that'll suffice.

01:47:26.885 --> 01:47:29.025
No further questions,
your honor.

01:47:35.393 --> 01:47:38.354
Why didn't you object?
That was military protocol.

01:47:42.901 --> 01:47:46.362
Captain McVay, what, pray tell,

01:47:46.363 --> 01:47:47.780
is your theory on zigzagging?

01:47:47.781 --> 01:47:49.990
Not so effective
against kaitens,

01:47:49.991 --> 01:47:53.039
It's a new Japanese weapon
a manned suicide torpedo,

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.329
<i>like an underwater
kamikaze plane.</i>

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.039
Hard to hit what you can't see.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.792
And on that night?

01:47:59.793 --> 01:48:02.378
<i>Let's get through this weather
is quickly as possible.</i>

01:48:02.379 --> 01:48:04.046
Cease zigzagging
until the fog clears.

01:48:04.047 --> 01:48:05.547
<i>Full speed ahead.</i>

01:48:05.548 --> 01:48:06.799
Tell us about
the sequence of events

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.842
the night you were struck.

01:48:08.843 --> 01:48:12.930
We'd been hit.
The question was how bad.

01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:15.683
<i>The Indianapolis
is a strong ship.</i>

01:48:15.684 --> 01:48:17.893
She's built
like a floating tank.

01:48:17.894 --> 01:48:20.401
We had survived
multiple attacks before

01:48:20.402 --> 01:48:21.772
<i>so we had to assess the damage.</i>

01:48:21.773 --> 01:48:24.733
- General quarters!
- We had no electrical.

01:48:24.734 --> 01:48:27.403
Did you get the SOS out?

01:48:27.404 --> 01:48:28.988
Pass the word!
Abandon ship.

01:48:28.989 --> 01:48:32.408
So you called abandon ship
about six to eight minutes

01:48:32.409 --> 01:48:34.994
<i>- after you were struck.
- Abandon ship!</i>

01:48:34.995 --> 01:48:37.329
How did you personally
abandon ship?

01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:38.810
Go, go!

01:48:44.921 --> 01:48:46.771
Can anyone hear me?

01:48:51.803 --> 01:48:53.153
Paul?

01:48:54.764 --> 01:48:56.374
Paul.

01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:05.107
<i>It was the last
I saw of my men that night</i>

01:49:05.108 --> 01:49:07.788
<i>and the last I saw of our ship.</i>

01:49:18.788 --> 01:49:20.468
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:49:32.969 --> 01:49:36.472
We wish to call to the stand
the only submarine commander

01:49:36.473 --> 01:49:39.558
who is relevant to this case
because he was there.

01:49:39.559 --> 01:49:42.728
The United States government
calls Captain Hashimoto

01:49:42.729 --> 01:49:45.105
of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:02.811
<i>Order in the court.
Order in the court.</i>

01:50:09.881 --> 01:50:12.883
<i>Captain Hashimoto,
you understand</i>

01:50:12.884 --> 01:50:15.469
<i>that you are under oath
to tell the truth,</i>

01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:18.973
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

01:50:18.974 --> 01:50:22.101
But you're not Christian,
are you?

01:50:22.102 --> 01:50:23.811
Shintoist.

01:50:23.812 --> 01:50:27.064
We believe that the soul
exists after death,

01:50:27.065 --> 01:50:29.733
and, yes,
I understand the difference

01:50:29.734 --> 01:50:31.860
between truth and falsehood.

01:50:31.861 --> 01:50:34.571
Very well.

01:50:34.572 --> 01:50:37.842
Tell us about your actions
on the night in question.

01:50:51.798 --> 01:50:53.818
Did you fire your kaitens?

01:51:38.803 --> 01:51:42.848
<i>So the USS Indianapolis was sunk</i>

01:51:42.849 --> 01:51:44.725
using conventional torpedoes.

01:51:44.726 --> 01:51:46.518
<i>Yes.</i>

01:51:46.519 --> 01:51:50.105
In your opinion,
if the ship had been zigzagging,

01:51:50.106 --> 01:51:52.076
would it have made a difference?

01:51:57.614 --> 01:51:58.989
No.

01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:00.949
<i>We were too close.</i>

01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:02.910
<i>I fired six torpedoes.</i>

01:52:02.911 --> 01:52:05.011
<i>He had no chance to escape.</i>

01:52:15.882 --> 01:52:17.942
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:52:23.723 --> 01:52:26.266
McVay must pay!
McVay must pay!

01:52:26.267 --> 01:52:28.697
<i>Call to order.
Please rise.</i>

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:34.819
On the first count,
failure to give the order

01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:36.819
<i>to abandon ship
in a timely manner,</i>

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.195
<i>we find the defendant,</i>

01:52:38.196 --> 01:52:42.324
<i>Captain Charles Butler
McVay III, not guilty.</i>

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:13.814
What does that mean?
What happened?

01:53:13.815 --> 01:53:18.777
They only announce
the not-guilty verdicts.

01:53:18.778 --> 01:53:20.904
He's been found guilty
of hazarding the ship

01:53:20.905 --> 01:53:22.364
by failing to zigzag.

01:53:22.365 --> 01:53:24.992
<i>They court-martial
our captain</i>

01:53:24.993 --> 01:53:27.286
and didn't mention
all of our dead?

01:53:27.287 --> 01:53:29.807
They should be building
him a monument.

01:53:32.083 --> 01:53:34.627
Charlie, I want you to know,

01:53:34.628 --> 01:53:36.648
I'd rather this
played out differently.

01:53:55.065 --> 01:53:57.900
Hundreds of ships
were sunk during the war,

01:53:57.901 --> 01:54:00.778
and yours is the only
court-martial?

01:54:00.779 --> 01:54:02.404
It stinks.

01:54:02.405 --> 01:54:04.005
Thank you.

01:54:06.076 --> 01:54:08.285
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's that guy?</i>

01:54:08.286 --> 01:54:10.346
<i>Who is that guy?</i>

01:54:12.248 --> 01:54:14.166
I need a few minutes alone.

01:54:14.167 --> 01:54:16.085
Captain...
Captain, how do you feel

01:54:16.086 --> 01:54:18.212
<i>about this being the worst
naval disaster in history?</i>

01:54:18.213 --> 01:54:21.733
- Captain...
- Is it true you were denied your choice of an attorney?

01:54:40.694 --> 01:54:43.362
This would never happen
in Japan.

01:54:43.363 --> 01:54:45.948
If the roles were reversed,

01:54:45.949 --> 01:54:49.889
you would not be called in
to testify on anyone's behalf.

01:54:51.162 --> 01:54:53.789
Was there anything
I could have done?

01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:56.792
You were exposed.

01:54:56.793 --> 01:54:58.403
We were there.

01:55:02.007 --> 01:55:05.467
As a commander
in the Imperial Japanese Navy,

01:55:05.468 --> 01:55:08.238
it was my duty to kill you.

01:55:12.976 --> 01:55:14.906
But as a man...

01:55:19.232 --> 01:55:21.172
I have regrets.

01:55:24.237 --> 01:55:28.427
I had a good idea
of what we were carrying.

01:55:31.995 --> 01:55:33.555
I, too, did my duty.

01:55:38.168 --> 01:55:41.420
But as a man...

01:55:41.421 --> 01:55:43.839
I find no...

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.360
honor in it.

01:55:50.347 --> 01:55:52.181
I often wonder
how things would be

01:55:52.182 --> 01:55:55.952
if I had stopped you before
you completed your mission.

01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:05.130
We have learned to
forgive each other as former adversaries.

01:56:08.198 --> 01:56:11.784
Perhaps one day...

01:56:11.785 --> 01:56:14.095
we can forgive ourselves as men.

01:56:29.219 --> 01:56:32.346
<i>They say we won the war.</i>

01:56:32.347 --> 01:56:34.348
<i>In my opinion,</i>

01:56:34.349 --> 01:56:37.977
<i>we'll really win
when there is no more war.</i>

01:56:37.978 --> 01:56:39.520
<i>And just like there were
different groups</i>

01:56:39.521 --> 01:56:42.147
<i>of survivors in the water...</i>

01:56:42.148 --> 01:56:46.318
<i>There are different
groups on land today.</i>

01:56:46.319 --> 01:56:50.155
<i>Every year,
we survivors gather together</i>

01:56:50.156 --> 01:56:52.408
<i>to honor our fallen brothers.</i>

01:56:52.409 --> 01:56:56.412
<i>Even though they're gone,
they'll be with us forever.</i>

01:56:56.413 --> 01:56:59.581
<i>Our new mission
is to try to make sure</i>

01:56:59.582 --> 01:57:02.918
<i>that even future generations
never forget</i>

01:57:02.919 --> 01:57:04.849
<i>the price that
we all paid for freedom.</i>

01:57:13.096 --> 01:57:16.265
<i>Time marched on,</i>

01:57:16.266 --> 01:57:19.406
<i>and I eventually lost
my dear Louise.</i>

01:57:22.022 --> 01:57:23.605
<i>And the memories...</i>

01:57:23.606 --> 01:57:26.567
<i>of all the boys
we lost at sea...</i>

01:57:26.568 --> 01:57:28.998
<i>never faded.</i>

01:57:35.285 --> 01:57:38.203
<i>And the phone...</i>

01:57:38.204 --> 01:57:40.104
<i>never stopped ringing.</i>

01:59:50.128 --> 01:59:53.756
The first day,
we must have had 120,

01:59:53.757 --> 01:59:56.759
150 sharks around us
all day long.

01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:00.095
It's a horrifying experience,
you know,

02:00:00.096 --> 02:00:02.056
being in the water,

02:00:02.057 --> 02:00:03.766
don't know if they're
coming to get you.

02:00:03.767 --> 02:00:07.061
If you hit those sharks
in the eyeball,

02:00:07.062 --> 02:00:10.105
it really hurt them,
and they left you alone,

02:00:10.106 --> 02:00:12.775
and you could see down
in the water maybe 50 feet,

02:00:12.776 --> 02:00:15.486
and they'd go down there
and just thrash

02:00:15.487 --> 02:00:17.488
back and forth in pain.

02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:19.448
Whenever they said there were
sharks in the area,

02:00:19.449 --> 02:00:23.160
I always pulled my legs up
and froze.

02:00:23.161 --> 02:00:24.787
And I was petrified.

02:00:24.788 --> 02:00:27.623
I saw so many sharks eating men

02:00:27.624 --> 02:00:30.292
that I never will like them.

02:00:30.293 --> 02:00:32.303
You know,
I think they're horrible.
