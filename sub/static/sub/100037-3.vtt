07:14.233 --> 07:16.803
<i>One of the most important jobs</i>
<i>my snow machine does</i>

07:16.869 --> 07:19.572
is pack down a really good,
safe trail for my dogs.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.242
Here you got a nice
piece of, uh, plywood.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.878
Give me a good sturdy box.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.515
<i>As my kennel gets more mature</i>
<i>and my goals get more defined,</i>

07:29.582 --> 07:32.385
it's definitely a 1,000-mile race
I'm training for now.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.755
I'm not training for a 65-mile race
or a 200-mile race.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.825
<i>And training for a 1,000-mile race</i>
<i>means living on the trail.</i>

07:38.891 --> 07:42.061
<i>And that means I need a lot of trail,</i>
<i>so the dogs don't get bored</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.263
doing the same 60 miles all the time.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.333
So my goal is to put
140 miles of trail in.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.969

07:55.408 --> 07:58.277
<i>I had to carry this big sled behind me,</i>

07:58.344 --> 08:02.348
<i>which slows me down and makes it less</i>
<i>maneuverable for breaking trail.</i>

08:02.415 --> 08:04.484
I mean the options
that this is gonna give me

08:04.550 --> 08:06.686

08:16.863 --> 08:18.731
Right on, that's perfect.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.766
Oh yeah, that's plenty of room in there.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.668
That's gonna give me
a lot of possibilities

08:22.735 --> 08:27.273

08:44.190 --> 08:45.925
<i>Throw a block in my path,</i>

<i>and I'm driven by the challenge</i>
<i>to overcome it.</i>

09:05.278 --> 09:09.682
This is bear fat that I rendered down

09:10.750 --> 09:13.953
I want to go try my hand at fishing.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.056
But my boots have
lost their waterproofing,

09:17.123 --> 09:21.727
and one of the cures is to get fat
that you've rendered down,

09:21.794 --> 09:24.030
and, uh, rub it in.

09:26.465 --> 09:30.303
<i>My food supply is not quite where I want</i>
<i>it to be for the rest of the winter.</i>

09:32.305 --> 09:36.976
<i>I got a caribou this year,</i>
<i>but I did not get any fish.</i>

09:37.043 --> 09:39.712
<i>Um, birds I have not gotten a lot of yet.</i>

09:39.779 --> 09:43.983
So, I'd like to just get out there
and try to get some fish.

09:44.050 --> 09:48.154
If I just get one fishy this year,
I'm gonna be stoked.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.925
<i>I got to get Little Red,</i>
<i>throw some stuff in it and hit the road.</i>

10:03.803 --> 10:08.641
<i>The danger to going out when it's snowing</i>
<i>like this, could mean for really weak ice.</i>

10:08.708 --> 10:11.110
<i>But liking the weather or not is</i>
<i>immaterial</i>

10:11.177 --> 10:13.479
to trying to get
something in for the freezer.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.381
<i>This time of year in Kavik,</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:17.650
I'm just inches away
from my total darkness.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.053
<i>The river is freezing over,</i>
<i>I've got a few open leads left,</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:23.656

10:25.091 --> 10:29.028
I've got two open leads of water,
and I just want to see,

10:29.095 --> 10:33.633
is there a fish as I approach
that goes ooh... and darts out.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.635
<i>The fish this time of year,</i>

10:35.701 --> 10:39.038
<i>they're just going into a phase</i>
<i>where they're not really hungry.</i>

10:39.105 --> 10:40.606
<i>They're getting sluggish,</i>

10:40.673 --> 10:42.575
<i>their internal systems</i>
<i>are slowing down.</i>

10:42.642 --> 10:44.310
<i>They're not gonna strike at anything.</i>

10:44.377 --> 10:46.345
So I'm gonna have to try and net one.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.080
Okay, as I'm coming up,

10:48.147 --> 10:51.183
I'm kinda going through
my X-ray vision to see if there's

10:51.250 --> 10:54.086
anything swimming around.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.323
I'm hoping that this ice is
strong enough to hold me.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.624
Whoa!

10:58.691 --> 11:02.461
I don't think I want to get super close
to it unless I see some fins.

11:04.030 --> 11:07.266
Whoa, oh!
What the hell was that?

11:07.900 --> 11:11.604
It's hard to tell,
there is chunks of ice floating,

11:11.671 --> 11:15.274
but it looked like a little tiny dude.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.512
I wonder how many baby fish
it takes to make a meal?

11:21.781 --> 11:25.051
This looks like it might be thinner ice.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.519
Yikes.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.525
Yeah that's right, fish,
I'm coming for you.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.727
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.900
I am not seeing a whole lot of nada.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.668
So, what I think I'm gonna do--

11:42.735 --> 11:44.203
I see more open leads there.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.206
Let me take a look down this way.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.709
<i>I need to find a deeper hole,</i>

11:49.775 --> 11:52.178
<i>some place where they're gonna hang out.</i>

11:52.244 --> 11:55.481
<i>When the rivers freeze over here,</i>
<i>a river's always gonna have</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:57.283
<i>some water running underneath it.</i>

11:57.349 --> 12:00.486
That's where the fish are gonna go,
so you're looking for the deeper holes.

12:01.087 --> 12:04.290
<i>The problem is, the ice isn't really</i>
<i>secure on those deep holes yet.</i>

12:04.356 --> 12:07.526
So, you got a real
Catch-22 going on there.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.865
-I heard a creak when I just walked.
-(ice cracking)

12:12.932 --> 12:14.400

This is not solid ice here.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.248
Can I go forward anyways?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.384
Aw, man!

12:32.451 --> 12:33.919
Whoo!

12:35.321 --> 12:37.623
All right, a little too close there.

12:38.891 --> 12:42.027
Good thing I got my bear grease shoes on.

12:43.028 --> 12:46.732
I was wanting to get close enough to see
if there are any, anything.

12:46.799 --> 12:50.503
Ooh! Okay, I guess I'm close enough.

12:50.569 --> 12:55.040
When you're walking,
you can hear before you feel usually.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.676
You can hear that... (imitates cracking)

12:57.743 --> 13:00.412
and the pit of your stomach
just drops out.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.350
Man, I hate getting so close.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.979
Okay, so I saw two fishies.

13:34.046 --> 13:37.249
That one was about ten inches.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.286
Damn you, damn you, fishes!

13:40.352 --> 13:41.387
Ugh!

13:42.922 --> 13:45.724
There are some fish right here.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.960
Now that I know that,
I really don't want to leave,

13:48.027 --> 13:52.965
'cause I'm convinced they're gonna have
a freaking fish party when I go home.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.202
I have a feeling this whole shelf here--

13:56.268 --> 13:59.405
I can see where it goes underneath,
I can see it's still pretty deep.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.340
I think that's what they're doing.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.576
My logic was sound.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.245
My methodology needed
a little bit of help.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.815
It is, you know,
I'm getting closer to dark time.

14:09.882 --> 14:15.020
I go from this to dark in about
20 minutes to a half-hour.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.159
I will, uh, have to pack up
the water sports.

14:21.093 --> 14:24.230
I hate giving up, but fishing's done.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.198

14:46.652 --> 14:48.587
Okay, I'm seeing some rabbit tracks.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.324
Okay, you kids see?
Look. You see, there's a row of willows?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.492
SKARLETT: Uh-huh.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.362
RICKO: Rabbit need a lot of willows
like this, see, to stay covered,

14:56.428 --> 14:58.831
to keep the predators from eating them.

15:16.148 --> 15:19.251
This is Rabbit Snaring
101 class right here.

15:19.318 --> 15:22.054
Basically, this is a picture wire,
but we call it rabbit snares.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.856
Okay, there's a loop there, now look.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.224
You twist it.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.826
Okay, now, you go like this.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.129
SKYLER: Oh.

15:30.195 --> 15:34.566
RICKO: You see, you make the noose
about that big for the rabbit head.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.603
You don't want it too big
'cause he'll hop right through it.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.271
Remember that little knot I tied?

15:39.338 --> 15:40.406
-SKYLER: Yeah.
-SKARLETT: Mm-hmm.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.374
RICKO: Now you twist it up.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.510
SKYLER: One done.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.613
RICKO: Now, we put it
across the trail, all right?

15:47.680 --> 15:51.850
So we want it hanging down just enough
to where he doesn't want to turn around

15:51.917 --> 15:54.053
and he'll continue down the trail.

15:54.119 --> 15:58.390
Pad it down a little bit, just to kind of
make them hop up along the trail.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.760
And then we'll put this,
just to fence it off a little bit.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.097
Maybe another one here.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.032
Little doorways they gotta go through,

16:07.099 --> 16:10.269
that's where our opportunity
to catch them is, right at the doorways.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.637
Okay, looks good.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.372
Now we'll do a rabbit fence, okay?

16:13.439 --> 16:17.743
We'll go all the across, maybe 50 feet,
and then we'll put snares in there.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.013
<i>I fence off an area,</i>
<i>the rabbits are running through,</i>

16:21.080 --> 16:23.048
<i>they hit that fence,</i>
<i>and I have some food laying around,</i>

16:23.115 --> 16:25.184
<i>the tops of willows,</i>
<i>they're gonna start eating on it.</i>

16:25.250 --> 16:27.619
Then they try to go through
these little doorways I made

16:27.686 --> 16:30.322
<i>with snares hanging in them,</i>
<i>and that's the opportunity to snare them</i>

16:30.389 --> 16:32.291
<i>is right in those doorways.</i>

16:32.358 --> 16:35.661
SKYLER: Grr!
I can't break this one.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.897
RICKO: You don't have to break it.
Just hand it to me, I'll break it.

16:38.964 --> 16:42.167
-SKYLER: Catch.
-RICKO: Good toss.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.837
-When I was about your age, Sky...
-SKYLER: Uh-huh?

16:44.903 --> 16:47.840
RICKO: ...I used to go out with my mom
and she used to teach us all this stuff,

16:47.906 --> 16:51.877
and, um, sometimes
that's all we had is rabbits.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.279
Growing up, we didn't have no store,

16:54.346 --> 16:56.582
and moose ain't always gonna be there.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.684
And you can only get moose
in the fall time.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.420
So, rabbits, once we caught them,
we'd put them away outside.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.923
They stay frozen, that's how we ate
a lot of the times in the winter.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.861
SKYLER: Rabbit snaring is fun
'cause my dad's helping us

17:08.927 --> 17:10.496
and it's a good experience.

17:10.562 --> 17:14.333
<i>My dad said it's a lot of money</i>
<i>to get stuff out here.</i>

17:14.400 --> 17:18.704
So the best thing is to do
in winter is set up some rabbit snares.

17:18.771 --> 17:24.343
Dad, if we catch a rabbit,
and another rabbit comes,

17:24.410 --> 17:26.979
if it sees that dead rabbit in there,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.481
will it walk away 'cause it got scared?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.883
RICKO: Um, not really.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.386
You could catch one and then catch
another one right next to it.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.921
-SKYLER: You can?
-RICKO: Yeah.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.791
Rabbit snaring is pretty simple,
but I try to make it real simple

17:38.857 --> 17:40.359
<i>for the kids to understand.</i>

17:40.426 --> 17:43.662

17:46.331 --> 17:48.200

17:48.267 --> 17:51.703

throw this underneath the ice.

with all the ice and stuff.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.150
There we go.

22:34.586 --> 22:35.787
There's the rope.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.193

22:45.063 --> 22:46.431
<i>We call it stitching.</i>

<i>you, uh, knock a bunch of holes in.</i>

22:48.767 --> 22:51.136
<i>Then we pass the string through,</i>
<i>which is our rope.</i>

22:51.203 --> 22:53.705
<i>And another pole comes over with a hook,</i>
<i>and hooks the loop,</i>

22:53.772 --> 22:55.073

22:55.140 --> 22:58.310
<i>until you've stitched it all the way</i>
<i>across to the furthest hole.</i>

22:58.377 --> 23:00.445
<i>That whole idea why we're putting</i>

<i>so that we can go from one hole</i>
<i>to the other with the net.</i>

23:03.648 --> 23:06.651

34:51.089 --> 34:52.824
You guys just wait right here, okay?

34:53.558 --> 34:54.926
Whatcha doing, moose?

34:54.992 --> 34:57.295
You gonna let us by today?

34:57.361 --> 34:59.363
Man it doesn't want to get off the trail.

35:00.298 --> 35:01.999
A lot of times these moose
will get out of your way,

35:02.066 --> 35:04.135
but, you know,
some of them are stubborn.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.404
They can be kind of aggressive right now.

35:07.238 --> 35:11.576
And I'm not really trying to boss my way
into it and end up in a bad situation.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.313
The last thing I want to do
is have to shoot the moose.

35:16.414 --> 35:18.382
Right now it's not hunting season,

35:18.449 --> 35:21.052
so I might just leave it
alone for a while.

35:23.020 --> 35:24.989
SKYLER: How do you
usually scare them away?

35:25.056 --> 35:27.725
RICKO: Just like this.
You got to give them time.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.128
You can't push them. If you push them
and they decide to charge,

35:30.194 --> 35:33.865
you got a monster animal
coming at 30, 40 miles an hour.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.101
Oh, there it is.
See, his ears back like that?

35:37.168 --> 35:40.771
-SKYLER: Yeah.
-RICKO: That's when it's agitated.

35:40.838 --> 35:43.875
Okay you guys, walk back.
Walk back. Walk back.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.545
(shouts): Hey! Hey!

35:49.747 --> 35:51.115
<i>They're a very stubborn animal,</i>

35:51.182 --> 35:53.985
<i>you got to give them some time</i>
<i>to kind of move out of your way.</i>

35:54.051 --> 35:56.521
The last thing I want to do
is have that moose attack,

35:56.587 --> 35:58.356
<i>where I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to eliminate that moose,</i>

35:58.422 --> 35:59.957
<i>and that's not what I'm trying to do.</i>

36:00.024 --> 36:01.759
I'm trying to respect the land
and work with the land.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.061
Come on, moose.
Get moving.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.165
SKYLER: He's moving.
Get out of here! Hurry up!

36:09.200 --> 36:10.801
RICKO: There you go.

36:10.868 --> 36:12.036
Success.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.238
Okay, let's go check our snares.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.715
These snares look
all knocked over, huh?

36:24.782 --> 36:25.783
SKYLER (off screen): Yeah.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.152
RICKO (off screen):
That's weird. Look at that snare.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.253
SKYLER (off screen): What the heck?

36:29.320 --> 36:31.989
RICKO: I don't think we'll catch
a rabbit way up there, huh?

36:32.056 --> 36:34.926
SKYLER: Look at that one!
That one's broken!

36:34.992 --> 36:36.594
RICKO: Look at this
one laying out here!

36:36.661 --> 36:38.996
Not gonna catch no rabbits like that.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.766
Our fence got sabotaged.

36:43.568 --> 36:46.404
A moose stomped this whole area out,
he's been eating on it.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.539
-See his tracks right there?
-SKYLER (off screen): Yeah.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.241
Holy cow!

36:51.008 --> 36:53.678
RICKO (off screen):
Yeah, a moose stomped through.

36:53.744 --> 36:55.646
SKYLER (off screen):
He took our bunnies!

36:55.713 --> 36:58.015
The moose went...(crackling)

36:58.082 --> 37:00.084
RICKO: <i>We had a nice</i>
<i>little rabbit fence in here,</i>

37:00.151 --> 37:03.054
<i>but a moose came along and started eating</i>
<i>and knocked everything over.</i>

37:03.120 --> 37:04.822
I was hoping to eat from this fence,

37:04.889 --> 37:07.191
but I ended up feeding
everything else, so... (laughs)

37:07.258 --> 37:09.293
We got more snares,
we put them on the trails,

37:09.360 --> 37:11.762
so less chance of a moose
stepping on them.

37:11.829 --> 37:13.331
Hopefully get something there.

37:16.033 --> 37:17.201
SKYLER: Is it right there?

37:17.268 --> 37:19.237
RICKO: Yeah, they're off
to the right, right there.

37:19.303 --> 37:20.571
Go check them.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.640
SKYLER:
Whoa, something tore it up!

37:22.707 --> 37:25.910
Oh no! Something teared it up!
Something tear it up!

37:28.946 --> 37:32.250
-SKYLER: Is it right there?
-RICKO: Yeah. Go check them.

37:32.316 --> 37:35.519
SKYLER: Oh no! Something teared it up!
Something tear it up!

37:36.087 --> 37:39.090
RICKO: Aw, man!
Looks like a lynx got this one!

37:39.156 --> 37:41.292
SKYLER (off screen):
Whoa, his head it's off.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.928
RICKO:
He left everything but the guts for us.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.196
Damn.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.632
SKARLETT:
The lynx got the rabbit.

37:47.698 --> 37:49.233
RICKO:
<i>Even though we lost a rabbit,</i>

37:49.300 --> 37:51.269
<i>it kind of gets my kids</i>
<i>thinking a little deeper.</i>

37:51.335 --> 37:54.272
<i>There's more to the picture</i>
<i>than just willows and rabbit tracks.</i>

37:54.338 --> 37:58.542
So not a bad experience,
but not something I wanted to happen.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.214
SKYLER: First the moose,
now the lynx ate our bunny.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.317
RICKO: Tough luck today,
but we got some more snares to check.

38:06.384 --> 38:08.219
Come on, Sky, you lead the way.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.353
SKYLER: This way?

38:09.420 --> 38:12.390
RICKO: Yeah. See that trail,
that rabbit trail right there?

38:12.456 --> 38:15.359
-SKYLER: Yeah.
-RICKO: Follow it back that way.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.695
Look around, it's to your left I think.

38:17.762 --> 38:21.032
-SKYLER: Where is it?
-SKARLETT: It's right there! Right there!

38:21.098 --> 38:23.701
SKYLER: Oh, snapperdoodles!

38:23.768 --> 38:25.303
RICKO (off screen): Grab the toggle.

38:25.369 --> 38:27.905
Well I'm glad that lynx
left something behind for us.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.940
SKYLER: This bunny froze!

38:30.007 --> 38:31.575
-RICKO (off screen): Frozen?
-SKYLER (off screen): Yeah, look!

38:31.642 --> 38:33.210
RICKO (off screen):
Let's leave it right here.

38:33.277 --> 38:34.745
We'll get it on the way back out.

38:34.812 --> 38:38.082
Yeah, follow the trail.
We got more to check.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.219
-SKYLER: Dad, this way?
-RICKO: Yeah.

38:42.286 --> 38:44.255
SKYLER: Bunny! Bunny!

38:44.322 --> 38:45.856
-RICKO: All right.
-SKYLER: Bunny!

38:46.691 --> 38:48.326
RICKO (off screen):
All right, another bunny!

38:48.392 --> 38:50.528
SKYLER:
We got two rabbits so far.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.797
RICKO: Well, three,
but a lynx got one of them.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.933
But we got more snares to check.
Go back here.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.369
-SKARLETT (off screen): Rabbit!
-RICKO (off screen): You got one?

38:58.436 --> 39:00.137
SKARLETT: Four rabbits!

39:00.204 --> 39:02.540
RICKO (off screen):
What a good spot right here, huh?

39:02.606 --> 39:04.508
Okay, you guys carry it out.

39:04.575 --> 39:06.277
Work together.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.880
It's part of living out here,
working together.

39:09.947 --> 39:11.382
<i>I was happy we got some rabbits,</i>

39:11.449 --> 39:14.919
<i>because the kids worked so hard</i>
<i>setting the rabbit snares,</i>

39:14.985 --> 39:17.254
and if we're not catching anything,
they might not remember it.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.990
<i>Not only is it rewarding</i>
<i>to get some fresh meat,</i>

39:20.057 --> 39:22.760
<i>it also rewards the whole work</i>
<i>in progress that they learn,</i>

39:22.827 --> 39:26.163
<i>and they reflect on it a little better,</i>
<i>and it helps them to learn the process.</i>

39:26.230 --> 39:27.598
And they enjoyed it.

39:27.665 --> 39:29.934
That's part of living out here
is enjoying it out here.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.070
You're not fighting with the nature,
you're working with nature.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.406
Well, at least we're going home
with something, huh?

39:35.473 --> 39:36.540
SKYLER: Yeah.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.809
RICKO:
We fed the moose with that fence.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.411
We fed the lynx.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.546
Now it's our turn to eat.

39:42.613 --> 39:45.316
-(pan sizzling)
-(wood crackling)

39:45.383 --> 39:47.318
SKARLETT (off screen):
Look what Dad's doing.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.420
SKYLER (off screen): Whoa.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.289
That looks so different from the outside.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.492
RICKO:
It's fluffy, that's why.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.897
Now we got to gut it.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.468
SKARLETT:
Its whole body is made out of guts.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.003
SKYLER: I know.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.872
RICKO: <i>I want the kids</i>
<i>to learn to survive out here,</i>

40:07.938 --> 40:10.007
<i>not just catch rabbits and go home.</i>

40:10.074 --> 40:12.743
<i>So being able to stop, make a fire</i>

40:12.810 --> 40:15.546
<i>and have them sit down and cook</i>
<i>and eat with me out there,</i>

40:15.613 --> 40:17.381
<i>it teaches them how to survive.</i>

40:17.448 --> 40:20.418
If they're a long ways from home,
and they get in a bad situation someday,

40:20.484 --> 40:22.186
they'll know exactly what to do.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.355
<i>It's basically life lessons</i>

40:24.422 --> 40:26.757
<i>that our ancestors survived on</i>
<i>for us to be here today,</i>

40:26.824 --> 40:30.428
so it's important I pass it on to the kids
so they have this knowledge.

40:31.495 --> 40:33.330
Okay, you guys ready to eat some rabbit?

40:33.397 --> 40:35.232
-SKYLER: Yeah.
-SKARLETT: Can I eat the heart first?

40:35.299 --> 40:37.067
RICKO: Get that one, Skar.
Eat that one.

40:41.405 --> 40:43.741
SKYLER: It tastes good. Mmm.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.510
SKARLETT: Dad!
Do you like the heart?

40:46.577 --> 40:48.245
RICKO: Yeah, the heart's good.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.821
JESSIE: <i>I don't want to have to turn</i>
<i>around because I run into obstacles.</i>

40:56.887 --> 41:00.424

<i>prepare me to make it to the end goal.</i>

I'm gonna head towards
the hot springs and, uh, you know,

41:20.511 --> 41:22.580
I got some trail to break ahead of me.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.883
I think this is really gonna benefit
my training coming up here in the future,

41:25.950 --> 41:28.819

45:44.742 --> 45:46.076
AGNES: Put him in the pile!

45:48.579 --> 45:50.681
TINMIAQ: There you go, son!

45:50.748 --> 45:52.549
AGNES: Ready? Girls?

45:52.616 --> 45:54.184
-TINMIAQ: Yeah.
-IRIQTAQ: Look, baby.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.986
CAROL HAILSTONE: <i>Right when we got</i>
<i>the net out of the water,</i>

45:56.053 --> 45:57.988
<i>the first few feet, there was fish.</i>

45:58.055 --> 45:59.923
I was so happy, I was like amazed.

45:59.990 --> 46:02.426
<i>Made me feel real good</i>
<i>to be out on the ice fishing,</i>

46:02.493 --> 46:05.262
<i>and I love spending time</i>
<i>with my family like this,</i>

46:05.329 --> 46:08.165
<i>especially when we're out</i>
<i>doing our traditional things.</i>

46:08.232 --> 46:10.734
AGNES: Hoo! This is the end!

46:10.801 --> 46:12.736
Right there, the last sinker.

46:12.803 --> 46:14.138
Cool.

46:14.838 --> 46:16.507
The end.

46:16.573 --> 46:19.676
Okay. Awesome!

46:19.743 --> 46:21.812
We have a load of fish here,

46:21.879 --> 46:24.782
this is a real good
job we did today ladies!

46:24.848 --> 46:28.085
We have a whole bunch of whitefish
and a couple sheefish.

46:29.119 --> 46:32.790
<i>It's always good for me and my husband</i>
<i>to bring our daughters down</i>

46:32.856 --> 46:35.292
<i>and go fishing with our own little family,</i>

46:35.359 --> 46:38.395
<i>so that way, we know our children</i>
<i>and our grandchildren</i>

46:38.462 --> 46:41.498
<i>know how to put the net under the ice.</i>

46:41.565 --> 46:45.302
Now it's your turn to teach
your son pretty soon to sink--

46:45.369 --> 46:47.805
CHIP: Yeah, when we were your age, this is
what me and your mom were doing.

46:47.871 --> 46:49.139
TINMIAQ: Yup.

46:49.206 --> 46:52.242
CAROL: <i>Going on the ice</i>
<i>for the first time finally this winter,</i>

46:52.309 --> 46:55.546
<i>being with the family,</i>
<i>fishing, it's all so much fun.</i>

46:55.612 --> 46:57.314
And I... I love it out here.

46:58.015 --> 47:00.717
<i>My dad always says if you give</i>
<i>a man a fish, he'll eat for the day.</i>

47:00.784 --> 47:04.221
<i>And if you teach someone to fish,</i>
<i>they'll always eat forever.</i>
