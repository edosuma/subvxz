00:00.156 --> 00:01.330
What's going on over there?

00:01.375 --> 00:02.930
Previously on <i>"The InBetween"...</i>

00:02.998 --> 00:04.256
Meet Damien Asante.

00:04.260 --> 00:05.876
- Welcome. Tom Hackett.
- Good to meet you.

00:05.877 --> 00:07.480
<i>Yeah, he's a former profiler
with the FBI.</i>

00:07.481 --> 00:08.820
<i>Transferred from LAPD.</i>

00:08.825 --> 00:10.558
I'm here now, all right?
I'm with you.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.810
<i>I saw some strange
stuff last night,</i>

00:12.810 --> 00:14.693
<i>and I think it might be
related to your case.</i>

00:14.693 --> 00:17.596
Whatever she says in there,
I'm counting on your discretion.

00:17.598 --> 00:18.980
Please tell me what the hell
we're talking about.

00:18.980 --> 00:22.143
My daughter has certain abilities
that can be very helpful,

00:22.145 --> 00:23.880
visions and communication
with the dead.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.285
The spirits, they seem to know
that you two are connected.

00:26.286 --> 00:28.377
Maybe if you stopped using
what she gives you,

00:28.378 --> 00:29.625
then leave her alone.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.490
Late '80s, six women murdered.
Took their eyes out. Strangled them.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.200
<i>Perp's name was Ed Roven,
executed October 2nd, 2005.</i>

00:37.500 --> 00:42.340
<i>♪ Everybody run
Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit ♪</i>

00:42.340 --> 00:43.900

00:59.620 --> 01:01.560
Hey.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.060
We need to talk.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.860
It's late,
and I'm not in the mood.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.430
Come on now.

01:09.430 --> 01:12.700
After y'all used me
to catch the bad man?

01:12.700 --> 01:14.870
I didn't use you.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.240
I don't even know you.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.940
You sure about that?

01:19.540 --> 01:22.540
You're the guy who sings
that creepy song.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.450
Hmm.

01:30.550 --> 01:34.760
You know, I was a big help
to your daddy.

01:34.760 --> 01:39.290
You should think about
getting to know me better.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.900
The name's Ed Roven.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.730
And I already know your name.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.330
Cassie.

01:45.330 --> 01:46.670
What do you want?

01:46.670 --> 01:50.900
I was hoping me and you
could be friends.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.140
That is not gonna happen.

01:53.140 --> 01:55.140
You speak your mind.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.140
I like that.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.010
Then you're gonna love this.

01:59.010 --> 02:01.080
Get the hell out of my house.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.650
Don't come back.

02:03.650 --> 02:06.120
All right then.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.860
But if you find yourself
wantin' a little help

02:08.860 --> 02:13.260
from over on my side,
you just give me a holler

02:13.260 --> 02:15.800
and I'll come running.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.930
Hear?

02:48.030 --> 02:50.360
You have to stop him.

02:51.230 --> 02:52.970
Stop him.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.710
Just check back at the station.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.040
Yeah, we'll go ahead
and call it in now.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.180
All right.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.320
- What have we got?
- Elliot Sinclair.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.420
Says his wife, Karen,
left the house this morning

03:12.420 --> 03:13.990
with their 13-year-old
son, Jason.

03:13.990 --> 03:17.420
Every day, she drops the kid
off at school at 7:45,

03:17.430 --> 03:18.990
then heads to work herself.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.200
But then Mr. Sinclair received
an email from the school

03:22.200 --> 03:24.570
saying that Jason
hadn't arrived.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.900
Uniforms check the route?

03:26.900 --> 03:28.870
No sign of them.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.010
If Karen was taking
Jason somewhere,

03:36.010 --> 03:37.380
she would have told me.

03:37.380 --> 03:38.510
What time did
the school email you

03:38.510 --> 03:39.780
to tell you Jason was absent?

03:39.780 --> 03:40.910
Uh, around 8:00.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.050
I have a big project due,

03:42.050 --> 03:43.450
so I was already at my computer,

03:43.450 --> 03:45.350
and I called Karen's cell
and then Jason's cell.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.590
Both went to voicemail.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.420
And then I did
the Find My Phone app.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.760
It said it couldn't locate them,

03:49.760 --> 03:52.260
which, you know,
Karen's phone is never off.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.390
And then I, uh, called 911.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.860
Have you left the house
at all this morning,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.200
maybe to go out
looking for them?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.930
No, I work from home,
so I don't...

03:58.930 --> 04:01.240
I don't really drive anymore,

04:01.240 --> 04:02.900
and we only have one car.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.570
Shouldn't you guys be
putting out an APB

04:04.570 --> 04:06.540
or, um, I mean, an Amber Alert?

04:06.540 --> 04:08.110
Isn't that what you do
in a case like this?

04:08.110 --> 04:09.810
Absolutely, but before we do,

04:09.810 --> 04:11.450
is there any chance at all
that Karen just decided

04:11.450 --> 04:14.950
she needed
a little time to herself?

04:14.950 --> 04:16.450
What do you mean?

04:16.450 --> 04:20.149
Was everything okay
between the two of you?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.660
Yeah, everything was great.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.060
I mean, we're about to celebrate

04:23.060 --> 04:24.290
our 15-year anniversary.

04:24.290 --> 04:27.730
God, I mean, guys,
something is wrong.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.230
Maybe you can come down
to the precinct with us,

04:30.230 --> 04:31.630
go through some mug shots.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.500
It could be someone
was casing your house.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.740
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, whatever you guys need.

04:35.740 --> 04:36.740
Excellent.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.810
Well, do you mind if
the uniforms look around

04:38.810 --> 04:40.410
while you do that?

04:40.410 --> 04:44.180
It's just a formality.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.810
Yeah, whatever you guys
need to do.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.950
But I'm telling you,
they're not here.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.420
<i>No, that's it.</i>

04:55.420 --> 04:57.860
The woman said,
"You have to stop him."

04:57.860 --> 05:00.190
All right, I'll keep it in mind.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.460
Anything else?

05:01.460 --> 05:02.860
That's it for now.
I gotta go.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.670
Your husband's here,
and he brought pastries.

05:05.670 --> 05:08.040
All right.
Well, love to you both.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.940
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

05:09.940 --> 05:12.810
- Hey, sweetie.
- What a nice surprise.

05:12.810 --> 05:13.840
Hmm.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.210
Don't you see patients
on Wednesday mornings?

05:16.210 --> 05:17.780
Yeah, I'm taking
a few weeks off.

05:17.780 --> 05:18.650
How come?

05:18.650 --> 05:20.280
I've just been kind
of tired lately.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.050
I need a break.
Oh.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.520
A break, that sounds lovely.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.990
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.590
It's just someone came
by the house last night,

05:31.590 --> 05:33.290
a spectral someone.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.500
And he said that he helped Tom
with the Shannon Bell case,

05:36.500 --> 05:40.070
but he didn't strike me
as the helpful type.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.130
What do you mean?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.540
It was just a vibe I got.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.810
I might ask Tom about him later.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.470
I already told the guy
to get lost.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.980
Did he listen?

05:48.980 --> 05:52.180
Yeah, I did that thing where
I put up a mental block,

05:52.180 --> 05:54.380
kind of like a locked door.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.980
Doesn't work for everything,
obviously,

05:55.980 --> 05:58.690
but it should keep him
out of the house.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.220
Coffee?
Yes, please.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.230
You know, when your mom
was going through this,

06:07.230 --> 06:11.060
the hardest part for her was
dealing with malevolent energy.

06:11.070 --> 06:15.700
She had ways of trying to block
it out that were not healthy.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.410
It's all right.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.210
I'm not her.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.110
By the way,
I'm gonna take some time

06:24.110 --> 06:25.550
off from work, a few weeks.

06:25.550 --> 06:26.710
I've just been feeling
kind of tired.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.380
I know.
You told me.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.020
When?

06:31.020 --> 06:32.720
Just now.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.090
See, this is why I need a break.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.760
Hey, do you have any soy milk?

06:40.760 --> 06:42.930
Yeah, in the fridge.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.700
Please, take a seat.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.770
First group are known thieves
and carjackers.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.140
Okay, what's the second group?

06:56.150 --> 06:58.710
Those are sex offenders.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.750
Let us know if any of these
photos jogs your memory.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.850
There'll be an officer right
outside if you need anything.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.520
Hey, lady, move it!

07:39.520 --> 07:42.260
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.920
Okay, thanks.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.030
Uniforms are done with their
search of the Sinclair house.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.160
There's no signs of violence
or a struggle,

07:48.160 --> 07:50.260
nothing pointing to Elliot
as the perpetrator.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.000
Well, he seemed genuinely
concerned about his family.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.770
He let us search the house
without a warrant.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.600
Called 911 as soon
as the school let him know

07:56.610 --> 07:58.270
Jason wasn't there.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.470
But statistically, when a wife
and child go missing,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.840
the husband's involved somehow.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.710
There's something else as well.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.310
Cassie called this morning.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.810
She said she saw a woman
and a child,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.880
and the woman said,
"You have to stop him."

08:10.890 --> 08:13.120
- Stop who?
- We don't know.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.390
The woman she described
wasn't Karen Sinclair,

08:15.390 --> 08:16.860
and the boy was too young
to be Jason.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.630
Now, listen,
I know all this is new to you,

08:20.630 --> 08:23.330
but I have a feeling
there's a connection.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.970
Preliminary background check
on Sinclair looks clean.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.870
Nothing on his record worse
than a speeding ticket.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.670
Friends say they seemed happy.

08:30.670 --> 08:34.010
Speeding ticket?
He said he didn't drive.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.840
This was back in Port Townsend.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.710
He let his license lapse
when he moved to Seattle

08:37.710 --> 08:39.380
four years ago.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.650
What does Sinclair do now?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.679
Technical writer.
She's in PR.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.220
Any financial problems?

08:44.220 --> 08:45.990
Not that I can see,
but it looks like they did

08:45.990 --> 08:47.350
move in a hurry and pulled
the kid out of school

08:47.360 --> 08:48.590
in the middle of the year.

08:48.590 --> 08:49.660
Sinclair sold
the printing company,

08:49.660 --> 08:51.260
took a loss on the house.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.830
Moving, career changes,
these are all major stressors.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.430
Maybe the Sinclairs
weren't so happy

08:55.430 --> 08:56.730
in their new home after all.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.030
Here's Karen Sinclair's
minivan at 7:38

08:59.030 --> 09:01.870
waiting at
the Columbia Street light.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.540
Her driving appears normal,

09:03.540 --> 09:05.170
nothing erratic, no speeding.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.580
She goes right past the turn
for the kid's school,

09:08.580 --> 09:10.280
enters I-5 north
at Cherry Street.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.680
She's headed out of town.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.110
And that's where we lose her.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.580
Maybe she was taking
Jason somewhere

09:15.580 --> 09:16.950
and forgot to tell her husband.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.590
Or maybe she didn't tell
him on purpose.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.520
But wouldn't she have reached
out to the school and her work

09:20.520 --> 09:22.690
to let them know she was okay
so they didn't sound the alarm?

09:22.690 --> 09:23.890
Yeah, makes sense.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.290
Zayn, call the Forest Service.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.790
Ask them to send up
a couple of drones.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.960
Maybe we can pick up
the van again.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.860
Copy.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.700
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.200
That might be Karen's car,
but I don't think she's

09:32.200 --> 09:34.500
in control of it.
Let's talk to Sinclair again.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.870
It's Cassie.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.810
Hey.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.310
Everything okay?

09:42.310 --> 09:44.410
Yeah, I just, uh, wanted
to ask you about something,

09:44.410 --> 09:48.280
someone, actually, who came
by my house last night.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.550
But you seem busy.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.220
We're working this
possible kidnapping.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.450
Oh.

09:52.450 --> 09:53.820
Look, give us a couple
of minutes.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.060
We'll meet you
in the conference room.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.120
Okay.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.600
- Mr. Sinclair.
- Hi, did you find them?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.630
Are they okay?
We haven't found them,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.070
but we do have some information.

10:08.070 --> 10:10.470
Karen's minivan entered
I-5 headed north.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.970
Do you know why she
would do that?

10:11.970 --> 10:13.140
No.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.840
Oh, my God, someone took them.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.340
That's the only explanation.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.680
Please, you guys,
you have to find my family.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.080
We're doing everything we can.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.750
Mr. Sinclair,
can you think of anyone

10:20.750 --> 10:21.980
in your life who would
want to do this?

10:21.980 --> 10:23.250
- Do you have any enemies?
- No.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.250
- Does Karen?
- No!

10:24.250 --> 10:25.250
Everybody loves Karen.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.790
I'll ask you again.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.920
Are you positive there are
no problems in your marriage?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.920
Is there any chance that Karen
could be seeing someone?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.630
We're happy, okay?

10:32.630 --> 10:34.260
I'm telling you,
they're in trouble.

<i>So you got run over
by a minivan,</i>

11:34.490 --> 11:36.860
but before that You got
run over by a horse?

11:36.860 --> 11:38.290
Yeah, sounds crazy,

11:38.300 --> 11:40.960
but pretty sure
they're connected.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.030
How come?

11:42.030 --> 11:43.570
Hoofbeats,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.670
both times, I heard hoofbeats.

11:45.670 --> 11:48.400
Okay, it's...
it's not always literal.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.840
Sometimes it's open
to interpretation.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.010
You just have to sit with it
for a while.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.180
Was there anything else?

11:54.180 --> 11:56.810
Yeah, the husband was driving.

11:56.810 --> 11:57.810
Are you sure?

11:57.810 --> 11:59.310
Positive.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.180
I'm sorry,
I have to get to work.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.190
Hey, didn't you say you
wanted to, uh,

12:04.190 --> 12:05.520
talk to me about
something, someone?

12:05.520 --> 12:06.550
You're busy.
It can wait.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.890
- You sure?
- Yeah. I gotta go. Bye.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.070
The whole "I don't drive" thing,
maybe it's a cover.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.910
Where is he?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.380
Have you seen Elliot Sinclair?

12:31.380 --> 12:32.710
He just said he had
to go to the bathroom.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.920
- When?
- Uh, a while ago, actually.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.880
Maybe 20 minutes.

12:35.890 --> 12:36.920
He's on the run.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.910
<i>♪ Peter Rabbit

13:05.920 --> 13:10.080

13:16.490 --> 13:17.990
When I told you to leave
my house last night,

13:17.990 --> 13:20.460
it wasn't an invitation to come
and bother me at work.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.500
You're gonna want
to hear me out, Cottontail.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.100
Don't call me that.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.600
All right then, Cassie.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.740
Don't call me that either.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.840
I'm here to offer you
a quid pro quo.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.680
- What?
- I help you, you help me.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.410
I know what it means.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.280
Why would I want your help?

13:38.280 --> 13:41.650
I know things.

13:41.650 --> 13:44.350
I have certain skills.

13:44.350 --> 13:50.860
- Your police officer friends, they...
- Don't even start. The answer's no.

13:54.930 --> 14:01.058
Think it over.
After all, a boy's life is on the line.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.640
What?

14:05.640 --> 14:07.540
What are you talking about?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.680
Hey!

14:13.650 --> 14:16.780
What are you staring at?

14:17.820 --> 14:20.120
You wanna help me set these?

14:20.120 --> 14:23.620
Sure.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.890
We put out a BOLO on Sinclair,

14:24.890 --> 14:26.660
and we sent a photo
to Border Patrol.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.400
And we have officers
searching the neighborhood.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.860
Yeah, well,
with a 20-minute head start,

14:29.870 --> 14:32.730
we're already behind the eight
ball, so keep me posted.

14:32.740 --> 14:35.170
Elliot Sinclair's phone,
six-digit lock code.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.240
Okay, I'll start with
birthdays and anniversaries.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.410
Just give me some time.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.070
Here's what's bugging me:

14:40.080 --> 14:42.680
Elliot started calling Karen's
cell from their home phone

14:42.680 --> 14:44.910
as soon as he got the email
from the school at 8:00.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.380
But she was on I-5.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.820
He couldn't have driven them
out of town.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.520
Maybe he's working
with someone then,

14:49.520 --> 14:50.850
because an innocent man

14:50.850 --> 14:52.520
doesn't take off
from a precinct bathroom

14:52.520 --> 14:56.060
leaving his coat
and phone behind.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.860
Unis canvassed
the Sinclairs' neighborhood,

14:57.860 --> 15:00.330
grabbed this off
the security camera next door.

15:00.330 --> 15:04.200
Time code reads 4:58 a.m.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.430
Okay, so our bad guy sneaks
into the garage,

15:06.440 --> 15:07.870
hides in the back of Karen's car,

15:07.870 --> 15:09.370
waits for her and Jason,
and then forces Karen

15:09.370 --> 15:10.940
to drive them out of town.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.570
That's not clear enough for facial
recognition software to ID him.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.315
Let's get this photo on the wire.

15:15.316 --> 15:16.726
I want it seen by every bus driver,

15:16.727 --> 15:19.210
train conductor, cab,
and car service in town.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.715
You got it.

15:22.550 --> 15:25.050
Forest Service got a hit
off one of their drones.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.950
They think it's Karen's minivan.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.700
Go, go!
Stay tight.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.360
I got left.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.400
<i>On scene, mile marker at 34.</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:40.940
Eyes on tree line.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.810
<i>Copy that, Victor.
135-34, stand by.</i>

15:51.110 --> 15:53.310
- Clear.
- You heard it, clear.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.650
All right, it's clear, guys.

15:54.650 --> 16:00.090
Stand down. Spread out.
Let's walk it back a little bit.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.960
All right, glove up.
We'll start to work on the vehicle.

16:07.130 --> 16:11.430
Get some tape on it.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.270
Did you hear that?

16:16.410 --> 16:18.170
There's someone over there.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.980
Got something!

16:22.180 --> 16:23.280
She's over here!

16:23.280 --> 16:26.980
All right, 360, let's go!
Herd up, red search.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
She's still alive.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.450
Medic, over here!

16:30.450 --> 16:32.450
Let's go.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.790
Where the hell is Jason?

16:33.790 --> 16:37.008
Establish a parameter of 800 yards.
Organize into teams.

16:37.010 --> 16:39.460
We need to search these wood
for Jason Sinclair. Move.

16:39.460 --> 16:43.300
Yes, sir. Lock down the area.
Get the K-9 units out here right away.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.670
Let's go!
Let's move!

16:46.797 --> 16:48.675
Yeah, okay.

16:48.685 --> 16:49.915
Thanks for the update.

16:49.915 --> 16:53.071
Search teams have combed the woods.
No sign of Jason.

16:53.165 --> 16:56.035
- When can we talk to Karen Sinclair?
- She's still in critical condition.

16:56.035 --> 16:58.905
They don't expect her to regain
consciousness for several hours.

16:58.905 --> 17:03.345
Doctor says she was struck with
her own car, just as Cassie said.

17:03.345 --> 17:06.244
Why would somebody want to
do that, run a woman down?

17:06.244 --> 17:09.015
Has some kind of meaning for him.
It's personal.

17:10.714 --> 17:13.885
Ah, looks like the security
photo of our bad guy paid off.

17:13.885 --> 17:16.724
A cabby from Seattle Metro says
he was a fare this morning.

17:16.724 --> 17:18.125
<i>Dr. Delafleur to OR three.</i>

17:18.125 --> 17:20.925
- Martin Keel?
- Yeah.

17:20.925 --> 17:22.265
Seattle PD.

17:22.265 --> 17:23.765
What can I do for you gentlemen?

17:23.765 --> 17:26.501
Your driver, Alan Saget,
told one of our officers

17:26.502 --> 17:29.865
that he picked up this gentleman
as a fare early this morning.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.535
The guy was waiting in the
cab line at the Hyatt downtown.

17:32.545 --> 17:34.575
He was dropped off a few blocks
away from a house

17:34.575 --> 17:36.205
where a woman
and her son were taken.

17:36.215 --> 17:37.975
The driver can't remember
how he paid.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.615
We're hoping it was credit card.

17:45.285 --> 17:48.785
Yeah, sorry, fellas.
He paid cash.

17:48.795 --> 17:49.825
Is the cab here?

17:49.825 --> 17:51.655
Yeah, it's up front.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.795
Now, I can have Forensics
out here in ten minutes

17:54.795 --> 17:56.325
to sweep for prints.

17:56.335 --> 17:58.095
But if you make me
get a warrant,

17:58.095 --> 17:59.035
it'll take longer.

17:59.035 --> 18:01.465
You say this is about
that missing kid?

18:01.465 --> 18:02.735
That's right.

18:07.245 --> 18:09.905
You walked right past it,
number 821.

18:09.915 --> 18:12.215
Much appreciated.

18:13.415 --> 18:15.345
Ready for hipster happy hour?

18:15.355 --> 18:22.085
As ready as I'll ever be
with two dozen Mason jars

18:22.095 --> 18:24.295
<i>Searchers continue
to comb the woods,</i>

18:24.295 --> 18:27.425
<i>but there are still no signs
of Jason Sinclair,</i>

18:27.425 --> 18:30.095
<i>who has now been missing
almost 12 hours.</i>

18:51.955 --> 18:54.055
Help me!

18:54.055 --> 18:56.555
Help me! Help me!

19:00.025 --> 19:02.825
Please let me go.

19:08.505 --> 19:10.205
<i>All right, kid,
thanks for letting me know.</i>

19:10.205 --> 19:11.905
- Cassie?
- Yes.

19:11.905 --> 19:14.405
She said the kidnapper
is bleeding out Jason Sinclair.

19:14.405 --> 19:16.005
Is there a chance she's wrong?

19:16.015 --> 19:18.875
Well, she wasn't wrong about
how his mother was injured.

19:18.885 --> 19:20.915
Any updates on
Elliot Sinclair's whereabouts?

19:20.915 --> 19:22.585
Not yet.

19:22.585 --> 19:24.485
Did CSU send over the prints
they pulled from the cab?

19:24.485 --> 19:26.685
50 sets, but I just landed
on a possible.

19:26.685 --> 19:28.325
Give me a minute
to dig into this guy.

19:28.325 --> 19:30.055
Maria, get a team together.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.655
Start calling
medical supply companies,

19:31.655 --> 19:34.125
sales, rentals
over the last two weeks.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.425
Not to hospitals,
just residential deliveries:

19:36.435 --> 19:38.595
bed, IV tubes,
hypodermic needles,

19:38.595 --> 19:41.065
whatever it takes to draw blood.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.605
Got it.

19:42.605 --> 19:45.005
Hey, Hackett,
I got into Sinclair's phone,

19:45.005 --> 19:46.275
and you gotta see this.

19:46.275 --> 19:47.905
Looks like right before
Sinclair took off,

19:47.905 --> 19:50.175
he got a text message
from a blocked number.

19:50.175 --> 19:51.445
"If you want to see
your son again,

19:51.445 --> 19:53.075
"click the link
and follow directions.

19:53.085 --> 19:54.945
"Come alone.
Leave your phone and ID.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.545
"If you tell the police,
he dies.

19:56.555 --> 19:57.955
It's time to pay
for what you did."

19:57.955 --> 19:58.855
You tried the link?

19:58.855 --> 20:00.355
Yeah, it's one-time use.
It's dead.

20:02.795 --> 20:05.455
What did Elliot Sinclair do
that he needs to pay for?

20:05.465 --> 20:06.925
Something bad enough to warrant

20:06.925 --> 20:08.465
running down Sinclair's wife.

20:08.465 --> 20:10.425
And if Cassie's right,
something bad enough

20:10.435 --> 20:12.565
to torture and kill
his 13-year-old son.

20:24.615 --> 20:28.245
He has certain skills all right.

20:38.055 --> 20:40.125
<i>The fingerprint we pulled
from the cab belongs</i>

20:40.125 --> 20:43.425
to John Llewellyn McPherson,
age 45.

20:43.435 --> 20:45.795
That's the guy that broke
into the Sinclairs' garage.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.605
This license was issued
in Port Townsend.

20:47.605 --> 20:48.965
That's where
Elliot Sinclair is from.

20:48.975 --> 20:51.305
Maybe the bad thing he did
happened back there.

20:51.305 --> 20:53.435
Does McPherson have
a connection with Sinclair?

20:53.445 --> 20:55.975
Not that I can find,
but McPherson's in the system.

20:55.975 --> 20:57.745
- For what?
- For hacking.

20:57.745 --> 21:00.275
The guy was pretty much
a Boy Scout for 32 years

21:00.285 --> 21:02.015
and last September,
he's arrested for hacking

21:02.015 --> 21:05.085
into the Port Townsend DMV.
Served three months.

21:05.085 --> 21:06.285
Did he say why he did it?

21:06.285 --> 21:07.655
Nope, just did his time.

21:07.655 --> 21:09.185
When he got out,
he sold his house.

21:09.195 --> 21:10.485
No current address.

21:10.495 --> 21:12.355
Probably going under
an assumed name.

21:12.365 --> 21:15.365
McPherson said Sinclair
needed to pay for something.

21:15.365 --> 21:17.365
Does McPherson have family?
Has he ever lost anyone?

21:17.365 --> 21:20.295
Nothing on the record.
Never married. No kids.

21:20.305 --> 21:21.805
Start making some phone calls
to old neighbors

21:21.805 --> 21:23.805
in Port Townsend.
These two men are connected.

21:23.805 --> 21:24.905
Find out how.

21:32.675 --> 21:33.475
<i>Got something?</i>

21:33.475 --> 21:34.845
Yes, I spoke with

21:34.845 --> 21:36.775
John McPherson's
old neighbor in Port Townsend.

21:36.775 --> 21:39.445
She told me that in 2015,
McPherson's girlfriend

21:39.445 --> 21:41.045
and child were killed
in a hit-and-run.

21:41.055 --> 21:44.555
Shortly after that,
McPherson began to unravel.

21:44.555 --> 21:47.285
The girlfriend's name,
Christie Marcus.

21:47.295 --> 21:49.595
The baby, Tyler.

21:49.595 --> 21:51.625
Cassie says this is the woman

21:51.625 --> 21:52.425
that she saw
at the house this morning.

21:52.425 --> 21:53.895
The woman who said to stop him?

21:53.895 --> 21:55.065
Yes.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.135
But we ran McPherson's name
through vital records.

21:57.135 --> 21:59.205
He wasn't listed as a father
on any birth certificates.

21:59.205 --> 22:01.135
You don't have
to be biologically related

22:01.135 --> 22:03.275
to a child to consider
yourself their father.

22:05.645 --> 22:07.405
Here it is:

22:07.415 --> 22:09.145
February 25th, 2015.

22:09.145 --> 22:11.475
Christie Marcus and her son
were out for a walk

22:11.485 --> 22:12.785
when they were struck by a car.

22:12.785 --> 22:14.715
Driver kept going.

22:14.715 --> 22:16.155
They bled out on the road.

22:16.155 --> 22:19.325
A witness later reported
seeing a white Mustang

22:19.325 --> 22:21.825
speeding by his house around
the time of the accident.

22:21.825 --> 22:23.295
Police never solved the case.

22:23.295 --> 22:27.495
Mustang, like the horse.

22:27.495 --> 22:28.565
Cassie's hoofbeats.

22:30.635 --> 22:32.735
When McPherson hacked the DMV,

22:32.735 --> 22:34.765
he was doing
his own investigation.

22:34.775 --> 22:36.575
He was looking
for the driver of that car.

22:36.575 --> 22:38.235
And he found Elliot Sinclair.

22:38.245 --> 22:41.345
That's why Cassie saw Elliot
driving the minivan.

22:41.345 --> 22:43.275
He's the one that put this
whole thing into motion

22:43.275 --> 22:44.845
when he killed Christie
and the child.

22:44.845 --> 22:46.615
McPherson is killing
Sinclair's family

22:46.615 --> 22:49.015
the same way his
own family died.

22:49.015 --> 22:50.185
Hey, new info.

22:50.185 --> 22:52.685
We just woke up a lot of angry
medical supply store owners,

22:52.685 --> 22:53.955
but we may have a lead.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.355
Palace Medical sold the items
you described four days ago

22:56.355 --> 22:57.755
to a private buyer.

22:57.765 --> 22:59.695
They were delivered
to 4114 Cranwell Avenue

22:59.695 --> 23:00.695
in Rainier Beach.

23:00.695 --> 23:02.795
Landlord confirms he rented
the place last month

23:02.795 --> 23:05.365
to a guy matching
McPherson's description.

23:05.365 --> 23:06.605
Good job, guys.

23:06.605 --> 23:08.105
Have a tactical unit
meet us there.

23:08.105 --> 23:09.505
You got it.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.805
Mr. Sinclair!

23:46.805 --> 23:48.545
West bedroom clear.

23:48.545 --> 23:51.745
You okay?

23:51.745 --> 23:53.585
Are you enjoying the show?

23:53.585 --> 23:56.855
Show me your hands!

23:56.855 --> 23:58.585
Get on the ground now!

23:58.585 --> 24:01.085
You guys are early.

24:01.095 --> 24:03.455
You're still gonna be too late.

24:12.665 --> 24:13.935
<i>He won't say a word?</i>

24:13.935 --> 24:16.535
Not even to ask for a lawyer.

24:16.535 --> 24:17.935
He's trying to run
the clock down.

24:17.945 --> 24:20.275
He knows Jason doesn't
have much more time.

24:20.275 --> 24:23.075
- Anything in his house?
- It's clean.

24:23.075 --> 24:24.745
What about the video feed?

24:24.745 --> 24:25.775
McPherson's bouncing
the thing off

24:25.785 --> 24:27.015
of ten different satellites.

24:27.015 --> 24:28.545
It's encrypted,
then encrypted again.

24:28.555 --> 24:30.615
Wait, are you telling me
there is a video feed

24:30.625 --> 24:31.955
that Zayn can't trace?

24:31.955 --> 24:33.555
He'll trace it eventually,
but just not in time

24:33.555 --> 24:35.085
to save Jason Sinclair.

24:35.095 --> 24:36.255
Tech is analyzing the video,

24:36.255 --> 24:38.095
but it's just a tight shot
of Jason.

24:38.095 --> 24:39.125
It's hard to see anything
in the background

24:39.125 --> 24:40.765
that might identify a location.

24:40.765 --> 24:44.035
There's gotta be something
this guy wants,

24:44.035 --> 24:48.205
something we can trade
for that boy's life.

24:50.805 --> 24:53.005
Thanks.

24:54.815 --> 24:57.075
How's Karen?
Did you find Jason?

24:57.075 --> 24:58.315
Your wife is still unconscious.

24:58.315 --> 25:00.345
But, no, we haven't
found Jason yet.

25:01.885 --> 25:03.455
We need your help.

25:03.455 --> 25:05.155
Yeah, I'll do anything,

25:05.155 --> 25:06.185
anything.

25:06.185 --> 25:08.955
We know why McPherson
took your family, Elliot.

25:11.425 --> 25:14.495
Because you killed his
girlfriend and their son

25:14.495 --> 25:16.895
four years ago.

25:22.735 --> 25:25.335
It was an accident.

25:25.345 --> 25:29.175
I got a text on my phone, and
I looked down for one second.

25:29.175 --> 25:31.115
And I... when I looked up,
they were in the road.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.945
- So you just drove away?
- I panicked.

25:33.955 --> 25:35.445
I didn't know they were dead.

25:35.455 --> 25:37.185
I swear to God,
I didn't know they were dead.

25:37.185 --> 25:39.525
They might not have died
if you bothered calling 911.

25:39.525 --> 25:40.985
I was gonna turn myself in,

25:40.995 --> 25:44.095
but then my mom convinced
me not to.

25:44.095 --> 25:45.755
I was... I was driving
her Mustang,

25:45.765 --> 25:49.125
and then she told
the cops that, um...

25:49.135 --> 25:53.565
That the car had been stolen.

25:53.565 --> 25:58.335
I have been haunted by this
for the past four years.

25:58.345 --> 26:02.675
And I know... I... I know I have
to pay for what I did.

26:02.675 --> 26:07.815
But Karen and Jason,
they're innocent.

26:07.815 --> 26:10.255
Okay, I... what... what can I do?

26:10.255 --> 26:12.185
Behe man now you weren't then.

26:12.185 --> 26:14.585
Take responsibility
for your actions.

26:14.595 --> 26:18.825
Write down a full confession,
and we'll give it to McPherson.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.165
And then he'll let Jason go?

26:20.165 --> 26:23.535
We'll do our best
to convince him.

26:23.535 --> 26:27.065
If you want to save your son,
this is your only chance.

26:30.945 --> 26:33.105
Elliot Sinclair is confessing

26:33.105 --> 26:35.775
to hitting and killing
Christie and Tyler.

26:35.775 --> 26:37.615
He'll do at least ten years.

26:37.615 --> 26:38.875
Really?

26:38.885 --> 26:40.185
Ten whole years?

26:40.185 --> 26:41.345
If you're looking for justice...

26:41.355 --> 26:43.885
Who said I'm looking
for justice?

26:43.885 --> 26:45.315
I get it, John.

26:45.325 --> 26:48.385
You want Sinclair
to suffer like you do.

26:48.395 --> 26:51.095
Not just my suffering.

26:54.365 --> 26:57.395
Do you know what happens
to your body

26:57.405 --> 26:59.605
when you bleed to death?

27:02.135 --> 27:04.505
Adrenaline levels rise.

27:04.505 --> 27:08.375
Your blood vessels constrict,
causing your head to pound,

27:08.375 --> 27:11.015
your vision to dim.

27:11.015 --> 27:13.185
You start to panic.

27:13.185 --> 27:16.215
You feel yourself
losing consciousness.

27:16.215 --> 27:20.885
And then slowly, inexorably,

27:20.895 --> 27:24.925
you slip away.

27:24.925 --> 27:26.825
That's terrible.

27:26.825 --> 27:30.395
Christie, the baby,

27:30.395 --> 27:33.905
they didn't deserve
to die like that.

27:33.905 --> 27:37.735
John, think about Christie
for a moment.

27:37.745 --> 27:40.005
You really think
she would want this?

27:40.005 --> 27:41.905
You got your revenge.

27:41.915 --> 27:44.445
Sinclair's life is ruined.
No!

27:44.445 --> 27:47.545
My son is gone.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.055
My child is gone.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.295
So he must lose his child.

27:56.295 --> 27:59.765
Your son was an innocent,
but so is Jason.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.795
Don't make him pay
for Elliot's crimes.

28:01.795 --> 28:04.935
You still don't understand.

28:04.935 --> 28:10.475
Jason is just the instrument.
He's a weapon,

28:10.475 --> 28:13.575
like the car that Elliot
drove into my family

28:13.575 --> 28:15.275
was a weapon.

28:15.275 --> 28:17.945
I don't feel anything for him.

28:17.945 --> 28:21.385
Yeah, I take satisfaction
in knowing

28:21.385 --> 28:24.215
that Sinclair will go to prison.

28:24.225 --> 28:28.325
But while he's inside,
if he can think about his son

28:28.325 --> 28:32.395
alive and happy in the world,
if he can sit and think

28:32.395 --> 28:34.625
about Jason out there somewhere,

28:34.635 --> 28:36.335
working a job, meeting a girl,

28:36.335 --> 28:41.405
if that brings Elliot Sinclair
even one moment of comfort,

28:41.405 --> 28:43.405
well, that's one moment more
than I've had

28:43.405 --> 28:46.105
in the last four years,
isn't it?

28:46.105 --> 28:50.645
Tell Elliot Sinclair

28:50.645 --> 28:54.585
the headaches will have begun.

28:58.025 --> 29:00.025
We're out of leads.

29:00.025 --> 29:01.355
We're almost out of time.

29:01.355 --> 29:02.685
I... I can't believe
I'm saying this,

29:02.695 --> 29:04.195
but maybe reach out to Cassie.

29:04.195 --> 29:05.255
If she had any more information,

29:05.265 --> 29:06.495
she would have called.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.365
Yeah, and I'm suggesting we
get a little proactive here.

29:08.365 --> 29:10.035
Excuse me,
what's that supposed to mean?

29:10.035 --> 29:11.695
When Cassie saw Jason
Sinclair being bled out,

29:11.705 --> 29:13.035
she was watching
the news report.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.935
Maybe we can try
to make it happen again,

29:15.935 --> 29:17.105
light the fuse.

29:17.105 --> 29:18.935
What she sees,
what she deals with,

29:18.945 --> 29:19.875
is incredibly rough on her.

29:19.875 --> 29:21.775
I don't ask her
to put herself through that.

29:21.775 --> 29:23.515
Not for me.
It's not for you.

29:23.515 --> 29:26.385
It's for Jason.

29:26.385 --> 29:29.315
Let her decide if it's worth it.

29:37.975 --> 29:39.668
<i>I'm not sure what help I can be.</i>

29:39.669 --> 29:41.515
He was just in a room.

29:41.516 --> 29:43.945
You know, I might never
see him again.

29:43.955 --> 29:47.531
This stuff only happens when
the universe wants it to happen.

29:47.532 --> 29:49.418
You first saw Jason
off a news report.

29:49.419 --> 29:51.740
Yeah, but it's been on the news all
night and I haven't seen him again.

29:55.295 --> 29:59.035
There's a live feed
of Jason Sinclair on here.

29:59.965 --> 30:04.665
If there was anything that
would inspire the universe to...

30:04.675 --> 30:06.835
To trigger me?

30:06.845 --> 30:10.575
Yeah, this would be it.

30:11.075 --> 30:13.145
Here's the thing, now.
This is rough.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.445
It's... it's real.

30:14.445 --> 30:16.845
You might not be able
to unsee this.

30:16.845 --> 30:21.015
So I'm telling you now,
it's all right, Cassie.

30:21.025 --> 30:23.625
You can say no.

30:28.165 --> 30:29.965
No, I can't.

30:48.285 --> 30:50.815
I'll be right back.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.495
What do you want?

31:03.495 --> 31:04.995
And before you say
you're here to help,

31:04.995 --> 31:07.095
I've done a little
research on you.

31:07.105 --> 31:11.065
You have never helped anyone in
your miserable, worthless life,

31:11.075 --> 31:13.875
and I don't believe
you'll start now.

31:15.845 --> 31:18.545
Maybe a little advice here.

31:18.545 --> 31:21.745
If you're gonna do this,
you'd better be all in.

31:21.745 --> 31:24.645
Hold back, and that boy's
as good as dead.

31:24.655 --> 31:28.815
What are you saying to me?

31:28.825 --> 31:32.825
Ever see little kids at
the beach for the first time?

31:32.825 --> 31:36.325
They run up to the water
so excited.

31:36.325 --> 31:40.535
But when a wave comes,
when that cold water hits,

31:40.535 --> 31:42.905
they turn and run away.

31:42.905 --> 31:45.265
They're scared
of the power of the sea

31:45.275 --> 31:47.835
'cause they know it just wants
to suck them under

31:47.845 --> 31:52.205
and carry them away.

31:52.215 --> 31:55.915
The inbetween is bigger
and stronger than any ocean,

31:55.915 --> 31:58.215
so you're right to be afraid.

31:58.215 --> 32:02.855
But if you wanna save that boy,
you gotta dive in headfirst,

32:02.855 --> 32:09.025
hold your breath, and stay down
as long as you can.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.352
How many teams are
on the street right now?

33:25.353 --> 33:27.805
<i>Officers have hit five storage sites.
So far, nothing.</i>

33:27.806 --> 33:29.675
- How many facilities in the city?
- 99.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.245
38 have first floor exterior units.
We've been trying to narrow it down.

33:32.245 --> 33:33.245
I've got it.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.645
Last week a guy matching
McPherson's description

33:35.645 --> 33:38.115
rented a unit at
Interlock Storage on Ashby.

33:38.115 --> 33:39.885
<i>Gave his name as Tyler Marcus.</i>

33:39.885 --> 33:42.355
That's the name
of McPherson's son.

33:42.355 --> 33:43.685
<i>Unit number 1022.</i>

33:43.685 --> 33:45.155
We're on our way.
Have SWAT meet us there.

33:45.155 --> 33:47.455
I just hope we're not too late.

34:14.525 --> 34:16.455
Lock clear.

34:17.695 --> 34:18.465
He's here.

34:18.465 --> 34:21.295
Stand back.
Keep your post.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.635
Maintain perimeter.

34:22.635 --> 34:24.835
- Clear!
- Medic!

34:29.975 --> 34:32.275
Is he alive?

34:32.275 --> 34:33.445
I'm not getting a heartbeat.

34:33.445 --> 34:35.145
Prepare to defib.
Clear.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.315
Let's go again.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.985
Clear.

34:48.995 --> 34:51.864
Again. Clear.

35:07.515 --> 35:09.675
Is it over?

35:09.675 --> 35:11.715
Yeah, it's over.

35:11.715 --> 35:15.685
Oh, God.

35:16.855 --> 35:22.525
I feel like a great weight
has been lifted off my chest

35:22.525 --> 35:24.795
and I can finally breathe again.

35:28.235 --> 35:34.365
People think grief
somehow fades with time.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.435
"Time heals," they say.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.875
What a crock.

35:39.875 --> 35:42.945
There's no cure for this.

35:42.945 --> 35:44.345
You can't accept it.

35:44.345 --> 35:46.085
You can't absorb it.

35:46.085 --> 35:51.755
Grief is a rabid animal
you hold at bay.

35:53.055 --> 35:59.065
Every minute of the last four
years I have spent pushing it

35:59.065 --> 36:01.795
into the darkest corner
of my soul,

36:01.795 --> 36:04.795
thinking of only one thing:

36:04.805 --> 36:09.935
to find and punish the man
who stole my family from me.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.145
Now it's done.

36:22.085 --> 36:23.955
Would you like to take a look?

36:35.265 --> 36:37.565
They're both alive?

36:43.975 --> 36:46.375
That's not possible.

36:49.015 --> 36:52.245
We found him.

36:52.245 --> 36:54.445
What?

36:54.455 --> 36:57.015
Just in time.

36:57.025 --> 36:59.285
That can't be right.

36:59.285 --> 37:02.155
That's not right.
What about Christie?

37:02.155 --> 37:04.925
What about my son?
What about them?

37:08.335 --> 37:11.335
Sorry you lost your family.

37:24.645 --> 37:27.185
It's a long road,
but Karen and Jason

37:27.185 --> 37:28.515
are expected to make
full recoveries.

37:28.515 --> 37:31.315
Oh, that is such great news,
you guys.

37:31.325 --> 37:33.025
- To Karen and Jason.
- Karen and Jason.

37:33.025 --> 37:34.225
Karen and Jason.

37:38.295 --> 37:39.825
All right, I'm off.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.635
I leave now, I will get home
in time for dinner with Brian.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.895
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Brian?

37:44.905 --> 37:46.535
Yeah, my husband.

37:46.535 --> 37:47.965
You married, Asante?

37:47.975 --> 37:52.245
Not married, no.

37:52.245 --> 37:54.175
Good work today, guys.

37:54.175 --> 37:55.975
Good work.

37:58.685 --> 38:00.215
Good work.

38:00.215 --> 38:01.885
Yeah, he's warming up a little.

38:01.885 --> 38:05.185
Mmm.
Another?

38:12.195 --> 38:13.695
Who's Sally?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.335
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

38:18.335 --> 38:19.705
It's okay.
Um...

38:22.875 --> 38:25.035
Sally's my fiancée.

38:25.045 --> 38:26.875
Or, at least, she was gonna be.

38:26.875 --> 38:27.645
I had the ring.

38:27.645 --> 38:32.215
I never got the chance
to propose.

38:32.215 --> 38:33.615
Did you see her?

38:33.615 --> 38:37.615
Uh, the two of you, happy.

38:37.625 --> 38:41.125
But it sounds like
something happened.

38:41.125 --> 38:44.025
Yeah, we were living
together in LA.

38:44.025 --> 38:47.565
She was studying for the bar,
working nonstop.

38:47.565 --> 38:49.065
And she started
to have these headaches.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.365
We figured it was stress,

38:51.365 --> 38:53.765
so she powered through the exam,

38:53.775 --> 38:56.775
then flew home to Seattle
for a visit.

38:56.775 --> 38:59.045
She was gonna see her family,
take it easy.

38:59.045 --> 39:03.415
And it turns out the headaches,
you know, it wasn't stress.

39:03.415 --> 39:06.085
It was, uh...

39:06.085 --> 39:08.715
bacterial meningitis.

39:08.715 --> 39:11.315
She collapsed, fell into a coma.

39:11.325 --> 39:12.755
It's been six months.

39:12.755 --> 39:15.325
You know, the doctor says
if she doesn't wake up

39:15.325 --> 39:17.725
before the year is out,
then they don't...

39:21.765 --> 39:23.165
You know,
I visit her when I can.

39:23.165 --> 39:25.605
I talk to her.

39:25.605 --> 39:30.135
It's like she's here,
but she's gone too.

39:32.445 --> 39:34.445
That's how it feels.

39:34.445 --> 39:37.515
I'm so sorry.

39:37.515 --> 39:39.585
My grandmother had dementia,

39:39.585 --> 39:43.755
and eventually she lost
the ability to speak,

39:43.755 --> 39:47.525
but sometimes she could
still talk to me,

39:47.525 --> 39:49.595
kind of like a ghost.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.495
If you want,
I can sit with Sally

39:51.495 --> 39:54.095
and see if she'll talk to me.

39:54.095 --> 39:55.295
I make no promises.

39:55.295 --> 39:59.605
No, I understand, but that...

39:59.605 --> 40:02.505
that'd be great.

40:02.505 --> 40:06.605
But if it's okay,
let's not mention this to Tom.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.205
He doesn't know Sally's
the reason I came to Seattle,

40:08.215 --> 40:11.845
and I don't want him thinking
my head's not in the game.

40:14.385 --> 40:16.855
Thank you.

40:38.705 --> 40:41.005
Guess you and me
make a pretty good team.

40:44.015 --> 40:45.885
We're not a team.

40:45.885 --> 40:48.385
I never want to see you again.
I mean it.

40:48.385 --> 40:50.685
What's got your fur up,
Cottontail?

40:50.685 --> 40:52.825
You get off on scaring women.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.755
That's the only reason you sent
me in there headfirst.

40:55.755 --> 40:57.355
You knew it would hurt.

40:57.365 --> 41:00.825
Saved the boy, though,
didn't we?

41:00.835 --> 41:03.365
Nothing comes easy, Cassie girl,

41:03.365 --> 41:07.705
not in this life or the next.

41:07.705 --> 41:10.905
I want out of the inbetween.

41:10.905 --> 41:15.205
I want to see what's waiting
for me on the other side.

41:15.215 --> 41:16.945
I hope you like the heat.

41:18.715 --> 41:23.385
Oh, I'm not sure it's as
black and white as all that.

41:23.385 --> 41:26.455
But either way, I want out,

41:26.455 --> 41:29.925
and you're gonna help me,
Cottontail.

41:32.465 --> 41:35.225
Wait and see.
