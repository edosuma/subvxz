00:01.835 --> 00:03.071
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.709
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.313
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
-What did you do?
-I gave her a memory.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.760
Do you realize what you've done?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.696
FADE: We leave
for the Underground tonight.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.431
-Stop the van.
-What?

00:30.464 --> 00:32.200
Sentinel Services
put a tracker on me.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.434
You set us up.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.035
THUNDERBIRD:
A convoy of military vehicles

00:35.069 --> 00:37.805
is taking Lorna and Reed
to a military airport.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.673
We need a way to stop that bus.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.145
REED: There's obviously
something wrong with the bus.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.080
Is your hate for me
worth more than giving

00:46.114 --> 00:47.615
your child a real life?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.217
If we get the chance,
help me take it.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.418
It's not working.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.286
Something's interfering
with my powers.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.288
Only thing I've ever known
that can disrupt

00:54.322 --> 00:55.756
mutant abilities like that is...

00:55.789 --> 00:58.259
-BLINK: Is what?
-THUNDERBIRD: Not what.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.561
Who. That's Pulse.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.795
Look, there's a lot
of people out there.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.397
Are you sure
you can fool them all?

01:03.431 --> 01:04.698
-Yeah.
-Be careful.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.000
You, on the ground.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.371
(shouts)

01:13.174 --> 01:15.075
POLARIS:
I can feel my powers.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.844
There's nothing in here I can
use. It's-it's all plastic.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.412
Everything metal's outside.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.647
The metal screw in my leg.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.014
Take it.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.283
(grunts)

01:22.316 --> 01:24.118
(bullets ricocheting)

01:24.152 --> 01:25.486
(tires screeching)

01:25.519 --> 01:26.954
-Come on, get in!
-Come on. Go.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.589
Go!

01:28.622 --> 01:29.957
-(tires screeching)
-JACE: Damn it!

01:29.990 --> 01:31.259
I don't just want them.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.660
Shut down every safe house,
every sympathizer,

01:32.693 --> 01:33.994
anyone who's ever helped them.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.396
I want 'em all.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.201
*

01:50.511 --> 01:53.013
-Daddy, come back.
-JACE (chuckles): No.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.315
Daddy's taking
a little break, sweetie.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.350
Uh-- ooh. Big, bad Dallas cop,

01:56.384 --> 01:58.386
-dizzy from a merry-go-round,
huh? -You get on it.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.788
-(laughs) -See how fast
she was pushing that thing?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.891
I need to recharge a minute.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.026
Starting to feel
a little better already, though.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.528
CROWD (in distance):
Equality!

02:07.561 --> 02:08.896
WOMAN (in distance):
When do we want it?

02:08.929 --> 02:10.130
CROWD:
Now!

02:10.164 --> 02:11.665
PAULA:
What's all that about?

02:11.699 --> 02:15.303
Uh, there's a mutant rights
march happening over there.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.505
Duty sergeant asked
if I wanted to do crowd control

02:17.538 --> 02:19.340
at City Hall, but...

02:19.373 --> 02:22.510
Told him I promised
my girls a picnic.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.812
(sirens wailing)

02:24.845 --> 02:25.913
You think something's wrong?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.915
I don't know. Seems...

02:27.948 --> 02:30.050
Seems a little bigger
than they expected.

02:30.083 --> 02:34.188
Probably dealing
with the overflow crowd.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.090
We should probably go, yeah?

02:38.058 --> 02:39.427
Gracie Face.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.430
OFFICER: If you do not comply,
we will be forced to arrest you.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.765
PAULA:
Grace, come on.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.368
Hey, Grace, we got to go, now.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.670
-Grace Elizabeth, we're leaving.
-Time to go, baby. Come on.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.906
-Almost done. -JACE: Come on,
baby, time to leave.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.508
Gracie Face.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.709
PAULA:
Grace! Grace!

02:55.743 --> 02:57.245
JACE:
We got to go, now!

02:57.278 --> 02:58.879
Grace!

02:58.912 --> 03:01.915
(sharp ringing)

03:01.949 --> 03:03.917
-(gasps)
-PAULA: Grace!

03:03.951 --> 03:06.887
(Paula screaming)

03:06.920 --> 03:10.123
(crying):
Grace!

03:10.157 --> 03:11.559
JACE:
Grace!

03:11.592 --> 03:13.494
*

03:21.902 --> 03:23.237
JACE:
Understood.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.905
Yeah.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.206
Talk to me. What do you got?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.641
That vehicle our fugitive stole,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.310
just pulled the GPS tracker.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.779
Vehicle's headed north
on 23 towards Druid Hills.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.581
All right,
reroute all tactical units.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.048
Get a drone in the air.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.451
They're gonna dump that SUV
as soon as they can.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.762
(panting)

03:48.796 --> 03:51.899
I know you didn't
have to save me, too. Thank you.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.734
Thank us when we're home and
safe. Right now, you need to get

03:53.767 --> 03:55.235
out of these clothes,
and we need to move.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.770
-They'll be hunting for us.
-I was so afraid

03:56.804 --> 03:58.238
I was never gonna see you again.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.007
Thank God you're all right.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.610
You said something
about Andy and Lauren?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.512
They're all right, Reed.
We're gonna see them now.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.814
ECLIPSE: These cars
aren't traceable, right?

04:06.847 --> 04:09.216
THUNDERBIRD: New plates,
no record. They're good.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.856
Thanks.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.693
THUNDERBIRD:
We got to talk.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.662
When we were out there,
when we lost our powers...

04:21.695 --> 04:23.130
Yeah, what happened?
What did they have?

04:23.163 --> 04:25.533
It was Pulse.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.267
He was there
with Sentinel Services.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.437
-What?
-That's impossible. He died.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.204
Marcos, I saw him. He's alive.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.473
No, he hated Sentinel Services.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.274
He protected
all his people in Macon.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.044
They raided that station.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.447
No. No, he'd never
work for them.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.382
God, if they can turn Pulse,
then they can...

04:50.858 --> 04:55.128
Sentinel Services drone
coming in. We got to move, now.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.730
It'll see us soon.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.332
I'll draw it off,
try to take it down.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.968
-Okay, I'm coming. -You just got
out of prison, Lorna.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.903
You go, I go.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.377
We'll meet you
at headquarters. Go.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.085
You see it? It's behind us.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.253
Looks like we got a new friend.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.389
We're gonna have
a lot more friends

05:21.422 --> 05:22.590
if we don't take it down soon.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.758
Okay, uh...

05:24.792 --> 05:28.596
(grunting)

05:28.629 --> 05:31.031
It's out of range.
I can't reach.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.734
Where is it?
I don't, I don't see it.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.703
Uh...

05:35.736 --> 05:38.138
it's above us.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.381
POLARIS:
Care to do the honors?

05:49.783 --> 05:50.751
Okay.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.720
Come on.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.222
(explosion)

05:55.255 --> 05:56.156
Yes.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.661
(panting, both laugh)

06:02.430 --> 06:04.765
God, I love you.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.833
Come here.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.972
Drone just went down.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.707
Lock in their last location.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.208
I want units
at every intersection

06:15.242 --> 06:16.477
within a ten-mile radius.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.812
I want our transport right here.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.213
If they're smart, they're gonna
take these side roads,

06:20.247 --> 06:21.715
head for the interstate.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.617
We'll cut 'em off
before they escape.

06:23.651 --> 06:27.120
They're really starting
to piss me off.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.092
(indistinct chatter)

06:35.529 --> 06:37.798
Shatter!

06:37.831 --> 06:39.433
Hey.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.502
What are all these people doing
here? What's going on?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.770
More like what isn't going on.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.605
You need to talk to Sage.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.340
(Trader screams in distance)

06:48.542 --> 06:50.010
What is this place?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.812
A Mutant Underground
way station.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.314
It's the headquarters
for the area.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.817
We're in the room downstairs.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.352
What about our plans
to get out of the country?

06:59.386 --> 07:00.821
To go to Mexico?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.624
We weren't going anywhere
without you.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.661
Reed.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.435
Andy?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.970
Lauren?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.240
Dad.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.211
-LAUREN: Dad.
-Hey.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.179
Hey. Hey.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.083
(sniffling)

07:31.652 --> 07:32.786
REED:
You okay?

07:32.820 --> 07:35.455
We were so worried.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.325
We thought you...

07:41.929 --> 07:44.732
(man screaming, grunting)

07:44.765 --> 07:46.967
How long has it been like this?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.036
A while. Soon as you hit
that convoy,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.638
Sentinel Services hit back.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.739
-How hard?
-Raided every place there were

07:51.772 --> 07:54.141
even suspected mutant
sympathizers.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.175
With no warrants.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.243
They are out for blood.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.512
We got our hands full.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.848
And we can't move anyone,
not with this kind of heat.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.583
I'm manning the scanners, trying
to keep our people off the grid.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.351
We need to keep listening.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.353
If anything comes up on the
radio, we have to know about it.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.593
LAUREN: It's not just
the thing with Dad.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.862
Sentinel Services shot Harry.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.096
ANDY:
These people are in bad shape.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.164
I mean, they're doing
everything they can.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.700
Hey! What the hell?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.769
-What do you think you're doing
here? -Let's talk about this.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.403
FADE: We ain't got nothing
to talk about!

08:23.436 --> 08:25.438
What's going on? Stop it!

08:25.472 --> 08:27.374
-(punching)
-Dad!

08:27.407 --> 08:29.376
-LAUREN: No, Dad...
-You nearly got me killed.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.545
Let go!

08:31.579 --> 08:32.980
-Reed! -Dad! -No.
-MAN: Yeah, whoop his ass, Fade!

08:34.414 --> 08:36.717
(grunts)
That's enough!

08:36.750 --> 08:39.853
What are you doing?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.454
How about protecting us?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.027
Just so y'all know,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.630
last time
I saw this son of a bitch,

08:49.663 --> 08:52.199
he was working
for Sentinel Services.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.167
(crowd murmuring)

09:01.141 --> 09:04.745
(dispatcher speaking
indistinctly)

09:04.778 --> 09:06.814
All right, I want three more
units in this position.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.882
Based on the drone's
last location,

09:08.916 --> 09:10.083
we know they're near here.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.152
What's the status
of the other roadblocks?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.787
-(phone ringing) -Every route in
a 20-mile perimeter is secured.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.288
Reinforcements are coming.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.590
Whatever we got, double it.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.592
Don't want to take any chances.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.595
Hey, babe. Everything okay?

09:21.629 --> 09:22.963
PAULA:
You tell me.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.998
It sounds like
you're still out there.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.068
I-I thought the transfer
was gonna be done by noon.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.071
Yeah, we, uh, we had an issue.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.974
I can't really talk about it,
but we got some cleanup to do.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.309
All right.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.912
Come home soon.

09:38.946 --> 09:43.016
I promise. When the job is done.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.019
When the job's done.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.424
I love you.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.160
-Be safe.
-Always.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.128
Love you, too.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.034
-Everyone, just calm down.
-Calm down?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.136
This dude's job
was locking up people like us.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.305
LAUREN:
Just listen.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.141
My dad prosecuted mutants,
okay? He did.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.878
When he found out about us, he
stood up to Sentinel Services.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.014
Yeah. By wearing a tracker
into my bar.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.783
Hey, back off my dad.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.284
REED:
Andy.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.321
I was doing what I had to do
to get back to my family.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.023
-I realized I was wrong...
-FADE: "And I'm sorry."

10:23.056 --> 10:24.624
-That-That's it, right?
-All right.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.193
Hey, just hear him out!

10:26.226 --> 10:28.361
(Trader screaming in distance)

10:28.395 --> 10:30.831
Okay, stop.
There are injured people here.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.700
Why are we attacking each other?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.168
You go. You help them.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.237
Take Andy and Lauren with you.
I... I'll work this out.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.906
-But he's saying that...
-(Trader continues screaming)

10:38.939 --> 10:40.741
BLINK:
Caitlin, I need you in here now.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.410
What he's saying is true.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.345
What?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.049
(Trader groaning)

10:49.082 --> 10:51.251
You go. I can handle this.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.093
Let's work this out.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.062
(groaning)

11:04.631 --> 11:06.066
-What happened?
-He was shot.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.335
I don't know,
it won't stop bleeding.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.737
Hi.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.504
It's Harry, right?

11:11.538 --> 11:12.840
Harry, I need you
to listen to me.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.107
I'm gonna take a look
at your wound.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.675
-It hurts...
-I know.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.677
I need you to be strong for me.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.179
I need clean gauze.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.447
Towels will work, too.
And painkillers.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.715
Dilaudid, fentanyl,

11:21.749 --> 11:23.450
even codeine,
anything you can find.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.651
Okay.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.025
We're drawing
a lot of attention.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.260
LAUREN:
Just ignore them.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.895
ANDY: Did you see the way
they were looking at us?

11:34.928 --> 11:37.965
-I think we should
just get Dad and go. -Go where?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.533
I don't know, someplace where
invisible guys don't attack us.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.770
Andy, we need to get them
to trust us.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.305
Kids, I need some help
over here.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.807
Help with him?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.541
Yes, Andy, with him. Come on.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.944
Let's put that Scout
first aid badge to work.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.380
(Trader gasping)

11:53.413 --> 11:54.815
Come on, just keep your eyes
open, okay?

11:57.617 --> 11:58.919
SHATTER:
Hey, there you are.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.823
Listen, some of us been talking.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.157
About that lawyer
who just came in.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.392
What about him?

12:05.425 --> 12:06.927
Might need you to do your thing.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.997
Now, if folks decide
that he's not welcome,

12:10.030 --> 12:11.464
you're gonna have to make him
forget this place

12:11.498 --> 12:14.067
-and everyone in it.
-Yeah. I mean,

12:14.101 --> 12:16.569
if-if that's what it comes to.
If Johnny says it's okay.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.139
Well, it might be that we need
to do it even if he doesn't.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.507
Hmm.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.616
What was he, uh, talking about?

12:29.649 --> 12:33.153
Was he asking you to,
what, erase memories?

12:33.186 --> 12:34.955
Uh, I manipulate
people's memories.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.790
Sometimes we just use it
for security purposes.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.158
Really?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.526
-I just thought you were able...
-You know,

12:39.559 --> 12:40.393
we should really get back.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.345
FADE: How can we even think
about trusting him

12:58.378 --> 12:59.646
after what he did?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.281
REED:
My own children are mutants.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.649
Do you really think
I'd betray the one place

13:02.682 --> 13:05.052
-that's protecting them?
-You tell me.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.687
-You already tried once.
-I am simply asking you to...

13:07.720 --> 13:09.222
-No! You can't ask me
a damn thing. -Let him talk.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.058
We're never gonna get anywhere
if you don't...

13:11.091 --> 13:12.492
John.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.361
-I need you to come with me now.
-What is it?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.662
You said to come find you
if anything's up

13:15.695 --> 13:17.797
on the police scanners,
and something weird's going on.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.666
All right.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.734
SAGE:
Until a few minutes ago,

13:21.768 --> 13:23.803
the radios were going wild with
activity. Manhunts, the works.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.705
And then the chatter
just stopped.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.708
POLICEMAN: We're gonna pull over
the large gray sedan...

13:28.741 --> 13:30.577
What, is that a traffic stop
they're calling in?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.479
Yeah, a-and a minute ago,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.814
it was a drunk and disorderly
over by the freeway.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.683
THUNDERBIRD: And there's nothing
on the manhunt?

13:36.716 --> 13:38.718
There's a possibility
they've abandoned the search...

13:38.751 --> 13:40.921
They didn't abandon anything.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.356
Yeah. We're handling this,
all right?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.525
Let me help you. I used to work
these kind of manhunts.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.160
I know the protocols.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.729
You want to protect this place,
I could be good for that.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.733
DISPATCHER:
Copy that. Be advised,

13:53.766 --> 13:55.402
488 at 17...

13:55.435 --> 13:57.770
488 is petty theft.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.440
Sending all units
for a petty theft? No way.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.578
You have a map?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.782
Right there.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.891
REED: The last three calls
to come in before this one

14:17.925 --> 14:20.360
was a burglary in Stratford,

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
lewd conduct at a bar
in Hapeville,

14:23.931 --> 14:26.599
and a 586 in Glen Haven.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.801
They sent multiple units
to all of these places.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.403
Which means that they know
we're listening.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.872
So now they're speaking in code.

14:32.906 --> 14:36.176
Sentinel Services
is searching here...

14:37.244 --> 14:38.979
...for Eclipse and Polaris.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.881
And they've got Atlanta PD here.

14:41.915 --> 14:45.885
They're tightening a net,
working a grid.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.521
Looking for us.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.329
Okay, I think we're clear.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.101
-You all right? -I'm not wearing
cuffs or prison overalls.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.971
I'd say that's a start.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.141
Hey. When, uh...

15:08.175 --> 15:10.343
When you were away, I, uh...

15:10.377 --> 15:13.613
I heard from the prosecutor
and...

15:13.646 --> 15:15.148
I heard...

15:15.182 --> 15:16.816
About the baby.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.954
I know-- I know you've been
through a lot.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.255
(exhales)

15:22.289 --> 15:24.124
I just want to know.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.525
Is it all right?

15:25.558 --> 15:27.527
Yeah, I think.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.029
I, uh...

15:29.062 --> 15:31.664
I can feel it.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.301
Almost the way I can feel metal
or electricity.

15:34.334 --> 15:38.138
It's in there, inside me.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.973
My baby.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.209
(laughs softly)

15:42.242 --> 15:44.744
Our baby.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.649
I haven't even said those words
aloud until just now.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.185
Yeah.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.620
Are you, uh...

15:53.653 --> 15:55.688
You happy?

15:55.722 --> 15:58.525
Look, when I was gone,
I thought a lot.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.394
About the world I was bringing
a baby like ours into.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.834
You know what I thought about
when you were gone?

16:07.867 --> 16:10.237
(laughs softly)

16:10.270 --> 16:12.572
How I couldn't wait
to meet this kid.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.677
How I couldn't wait
to be a father.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.921
POLARIS:
Marcos.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.893
We're gonna have a weird kid.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.529
(both laugh)

16:36.563 --> 16:39.532
If it's a girl,
we should call her Aurora.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.534
Aurora?

16:41.568 --> 16:44.204
And what if
it's a-- it's a boy, what?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.438
Rory?

16:45.472 --> 16:48.075
Rory? Rory...

16:48.108 --> 16:50.777
-We're not naming our son Rory.
-Come on, what?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.745
It's just a thought. I mean,
it's the boy version of Aurora.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.381
Right?

16:56.083 --> 16:59.386
-I love you.
-I love you.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.755
Weeks.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.024
-Where are my other units?
-ETA ten minutes.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.427
I made a request for this
position 20 minutes ago.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.028
Deputy director
rerouted some units

17:09.062 --> 17:11.398
-to expand the search toward...
-Why?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.799
This is the objective,
right here.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.436
I want bodies, I want 'em now.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.405
(sighs)

17:21.741 --> 17:23.510
Marcos.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.980
We got to find another route.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.549
No. Keep going.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.050
-What?
-Keep going.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.619
-What are you talking about?
-Go!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.954
Lorna, what are you doing?

17:34.987 --> 17:37.590
-Lorna.
-(engine revs)

17:37.624 --> 17:39.058
Lorna!

17:39.092 --> 17:40.460
Weapons up!

17:41.628 --> 17:45.064
Lorna, stop! Stop the car now!

17:45.098 --> 17:46.133
(tires screeching)

17:46.166 --> 17:48.501
Out of the car
with your hands up!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.370
(screams)

17:53.106 --> 17:56.109
JACE:
Stand down, or I will open fire.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.278
(shouts)

18:02.382 --> 18:04.584
Uh, babe, we have to go.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.286
POLARIS:
Oh, we're going.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.122
But this one's coming with us.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.695
JACE: If you want to shoot me,
shoot me.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.929
Just get this over with.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.097
(grunts)

18:18.131 --> 18:19.799
POLARIS:
You wish.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.409
(grunting)

18:31.043 --> 18:32.979
Lorna.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.948
Lorna. Lorna.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.384
Lorna.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.219
What? He likes putting collars
on people so much,

18:39.252 --> 18:41.621
-I thought I'd give him
one of his own. -Hey.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.557
We just kidnapped
a Sentinel Services agent.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.193
Do you have any idea
what this means?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.827
I'll tell you exactly
what it means.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.730
This is our chance to find out
what happened to Pulse.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.366
If they're turning us
against each other, we're done.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.202
The network, all of it is over.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.969
-We have to figure out what's
going on. -Yeah, but look,

18:57.003 --> 18:58.371
they will be searching for him.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.507
Yeah, because they know
how valuable he is.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.443
Marcos, Pulse was John's
best friend.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.913
Look, if they can get him,
they can get anyone.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.116
Look at me.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.987
They were gonna try to turn me.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.524
Think about that.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.259
What it would've meant.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.262
Okay? We have to do this.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.067
(quietly):
Yeah.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.177
Are there more I.V. bags?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.447
You mean, those water things,
or the yellow pee-looking ones?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.215
Could you be any more gross?

19:42.249 --> 19:43.516
You really want to ask me that?

19:43.550 --> 19:44.917
(groans)

19:44.951 --> 19:47.787
Um, I think we're out of both.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.558
ANDY:
Is he gonna be okay?

19:51.591 --> 19:54.060
I'm not even sure
more saline would help.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.128
We need actual blood.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.499
Okay, here.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.403
Hey, I'm O negative.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.473
It's universal donor, right?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.941
-Andy. -What, are you surprised
I actually remember something

20:08.975 --> 20:10.710
-from biology?
-No.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.744
I am.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.814
I can do it.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.617
(sighs)

20:17.650 --> 20:19.719
Okay.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.323
Come here, put your sleeve up.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.460
There, I'll do that.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.831
Okay. Okay.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.969
Lauren, hold this.

20:37.003 --> 20:37.937
Thanks.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.908
Okay?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.276
Okay.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.248
-You ready?
-Yeah.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.451
Just take a deep breath.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.586
Stand there,
don't move your arm.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.089
And gravity will do the rest.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.526
If the cops really
are coming here,

20:59.559 --> 21:00.993
we could try and leave, but...

21:01.027 --> 21:02.529
Uh, based on average
police response times,

21:02.562 --> 21:04.631
any identifiable mutants
leaving here

21:04.664 --> 21:06.833
will be apprehended
before we're out of city limits.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.701
REED:
They're looking for fugitives.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.170
The only thing that's gonna
stop them is if they find one.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.171
What are you saying?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.342
I have to go out there.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.509
Get seen.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.277
Steer 'em away from this place.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.380
Make it look like we went
in another direction.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.049
Even if they see you, it doesn't
mean they'll stop searching.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.551
I know how these things work.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.487
They made an educated guess
about the direction we went.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.289
If they were to see me
anywhere here,

21:30.323 --> 21:34.060
they would assume I was going
to 85 South, toward Alabama,

21:34.093 --> 21:35.628
and they would redirect
the search that way.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.630
And if you get caught,
they'll question you.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.499
And you know our location.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.833
THUNDERBIRD:
Maybe we can avoid that.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.311
In that convoy today,
one of your guards was a mutant.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.514
What was Pulse doing with you?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.082
What'd it look
like he was doing?

21:56.115 --> 21:57.249
He was working with us.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.418
Not all mutants are terrorists.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.586
POLARIS:
So what you're saying is,

21:59.619 --> 22:00.820
after you shot him,

22:00.853 --> 22:02.188
he was so overwhelmed
with gratitude

22:02.221 --> 22:04.857
that he decided to turn
on all of his friends?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.693
What, he took up genocide
as a hobby?

22:06.726 --> 22:08.027
Genocide?
Wow, is that...

22:08.060 --> 22:09.662
is that what you think
this is about?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.163
Is that what you tell yourself?

22:11.197 --> 22:12.399
What else is it about?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.233
How about July 15?

22:14.266 --> 22:16.102
Hey, now, that was the actions
of a few people.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.905
Not all mutants,
whatever your politicians say.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.573
A lot of people died
on both sides.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.542
Yeah, they did.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.743
And you know what?

22:23.776 --> 22:24.744
Nobody had to die.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.748
I'm not going to sit here
and apologize

22:28.781 --> 22:30.349
for trying to stop violence...

22:30.383 --> 22:31.851
ECLIPSE:
What, with more violence?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.753
You know, 7/15 started
as a peaceful protest!

22:35.622 --> 22:37.957
Well, your peaceful protest
killed my little girl.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.636
She was seven, man.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.071
Barely even knew
what a mutant was.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.483
Marcos, come here.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.389
(Eclipse sighs)

23:10.423 --> 23:13.325
Look, I, uh, I feel for him.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.961
-Okay? I really do.
-Yeah.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.395
But we've got to remember
all the people

23:16.429 --> 23:18.565
we have lost since 7/15.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.067
Okay, the world changed
for everyone that day,

23:21.100 --> 23:23.570
but us most of all.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.972
Thousands dead.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.407
Mutants being hunted
all across the country...

23:28.441 --> 23:29.642
I don't need a history lesson.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.177
Are you sure?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.480
Look, we're fighting
for our lives here.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.448
We're fighting for every mutant

23:35.482 --> 23:37.149
that could be turned
into a weapon against us.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.818
Look at him.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.120
You think he's going to give us
any information now?

23:45.357 --> 23:48.427
Well, if he's not going
to give it to us...

23:48.461 --> 23:50.362
we're gonna have to take it.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.403
(phone ringing)

23:59.639 --> 24:00.840
DREAMER (over phone):
Are you all right?

24:00.873 --> 24:02.208
Everyone's worried
you're not back.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.476
I know, something came up.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.978
-Look, we kidnapped a
Sentinel Services agent. -What?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.680
What are you talking about?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.482
Listen, I'll explain later.
I know it's dangerous.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.550
But you need to get here now.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.556
I'm asking you to help save
the whole station.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.990
He's going to lure the cops,

24:18.024 --> 24:19.291
point 'em
in the wrong direction.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.694
You just get him
back here safely.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.395
I know you're not happy with me,

24:23.429 --> 24:25.331
but I've taken full
responsibility for what I did.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.834
Is this a joke?

24:27.867 --> 24:31.137
You want me to go out there
and save this guy's ass?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.705
One of our people
just took a bullet in the gut

24:32.739 --> 24:33.906
saving this man.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.708
We need his help.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.848
You're gonna do this.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.118
Whatever you say, boss.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.059
You talk to your family
if you need to.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.360
You're leaving in five.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.334
CAITLIN: No.
Reed, you-you can't do this.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.770
We just got you back.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.772
-The police are coming.
-(sighs)

25:05.805 --> 25:07.206
We can't evacuate,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.775
and even if we did,
there is nowhere to go.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.342
It has to be you?

25:10.376 --> 25:11.578
I mean, we're in a building

25:11.611 --> 25:13.179
filled with people
with powers...

25:13.212 --> 25:14.847
They didn't just escape
from jail.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.883
They're looking for me.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.619
These people...

25:19.652 --> 25:22.354
they need to know
which side I'm on.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.592
And if this is my chance to make
things right, I have to take it.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.766
What will I tell the kids?

25:36.402 --> 25:38.170
Tell them I'll be back
by dinner.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.573
You better.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.320
(Lauren sighs)

26:01.260 --> 26:03.462
-Are you okay?
-(gasping)

26:03.495 --> 26:05.898
-You need to hold still!
-What's wrong with him?

26:05.932 --> 26:08.735
-What's he doing?
-We're running out of time.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.703
We're gonna have
to remove the bullet, okay?

26:12.438 --> 26:13.439
(gasping)

26:19.011 --> 26:20.512
Hey.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.983
You know this is only gonna
get worse, right?

26:24.016 --> 26:25.151
Oh, yeah?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.486
For us or for you?

26:27.519 --> 26:28.821
You're in enough trouble
as it is.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.289
You really want
to add kidnapping me

26:30.322 --> 26:31.924
to your list of charges?

26:31.958 --> 26:34.160
Your only move is to let me go

26:34.193 --> 26:35.862
and hope for the best.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.633
I'll make you a deal,
Agent Turner.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.601
You want us to let you go?

26:42.635 --> 26:43.870
Tell us the truth.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.504
Tell us about our friend Pulse.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.106
Tell us about those secret
detention facilities

26:47.139 --> 26:49.208
-you love so much.
-They're only kept secret

26:49.241 --> 26:51.678
to protect them from people
like you, Ms. Dane.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.479
They keep dangerous people
off the streets.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.614
People? You mean mutants.

26:55.648 --> 26:56.716
And last time I checked,

26:56.749 --> 26:57.984
Pulse wasn't off the streets,

26:58.017 --> 26:59.185
he was guarding
your prison convoy.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.452
Look, if you're hoping
that I'm gonna

27:00.486 --> 27:02.054
fill you in
on employee personnel files,

27:02.088 --> 27:03.089
prepare to be disappointed.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.998
Look, uh, we're going to find
out what we want to know,

27:12.031 --> 27:13.632
one way or another.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.367
So you're talking torture now?

27:15.401 --> 27:17.003
POLARIS:
No.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.338
That's more your department,
remember?

27:19.371 --> 27:20.840
-Yeah, you...
-(crackling)

27:20.873 --> 27:23.142
Hey.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.644
We got here
as quickly as we could.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.479
We've got something else
in mind.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.715
ECLIPSE: Why didn't
you guys use the door?

27:28.748 --> 27:29.749
We're trying to
keep a low profile here.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.550
Pretty sure
that ship has sailed.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.853
(vehicles approaching)

27:33.886 --> 27:36.555
(tires screeching)

27:36.588 --> 27:38.190
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:38.224 --> 27:39.125
(indistinct chatter)

27:40.693 --> 27:43.362
WOMAN:
Clear the southwest sector.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.933
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:46.966 --> 27:49.769
OFFICER (over bullhorn):
This is Sentinel Services.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.404
We know you have the hostage.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.605
Come out now!

27:59.812 --> 28:02.849
Traffic cameras are hooked into
the district police station.

28:02.882 --> 28:06.118
Once I'm spotted, it'll send
the cops in the wrong direction,

28:06.152 --> 28:07.954
away from the
Mutant Underground.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.621
I'll meet you two blocks up,
on Elm.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.690
Right?

28:11.724 --> 28:13.625
You got it, Counselor.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.070
(tires squealing)

28:37.149 --> 28:38.751
MAN:
What's the matter with that guy?

28:53.766 --> 28:55.802
*

29:11.951 --> 29:13.585
DISPATCH:
Fugitive suspect identified

29:13.619 --> 29:14.921
on the corner
of Waverly and Green,

29:14.954 --> 29:16.522
near the 85 on-ramp.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.257
Say again: Waverly and Green.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.658
All units converge immediately.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.627
That's the call. They're on him.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.129
OFFICER:
Unit 3223 en route.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.430
It's working.

29:24.463 --> 29:25.865
They're redirecting
their search south.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.867
We're in the clear.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.035
But he's not.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.037
Text his burner.
Tell him to get out of there.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.005
(phone buzzes)

29:40.880 --> 29:42.481
ANDY:
Can you take the bullet out?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.483
CAITLIN: I don't know.
I-I-I'm not a surgeon.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.985
But we can't wait any longer.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.619
I'm just gonna have
to take the chance.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.622
So, do I just stay hooked up
to him or...?

29:50.656 --> 29:51.723
If you can.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.359
The bullet's lodged too deep.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.527
I'm going to have to make
a midline incision.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.795
Lauren, just keep pressure

29:56.829 --> 29:58.865
on that entry wound.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.833
Ready?

30:01.934 --> 30:02.935
(Lauren groans)

30:14.746 --> 30:15.714
Okay.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.986
Okay, there it is.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.053
Okay.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.924
Okay.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.197
Got it.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.065
ANDY:
Badass.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.733
CAITLIN:
Okay.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.471
(gasping)

30:47.880 --> 30:49.181
(gasping)

30:49.215 --> 30:50.449
LAUREN:
Mom?

30:50.482 --> 30:51.683
Mom, what's happening?

30:51.717 --> 30:52.784
He's hemorrhaging.

30:52.818 --> 30:53.953
An artery must have...

30:53.986 --> 30:56.022
It's not stopping! It's...

30:56.055 --> 30:57.456
I can't stop the blood.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.891
Not without a cross-clamp.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.626
-LAUREN: Where's the artery?
-What?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.361
-Show me.
-Lauren, I...

31:02.394 --> 31:04.030
-I-I-I don't know...
-Mom, show me!

31:04.063 --> 31:05.898
What? There.
The bleeding's coming

31:05.932 --> 31:07.199
from that artery right there.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.567
Okay, stand back.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.069
I'm gonna try
to get pressure on it.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.111
I think... I think I got it.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.579
(gasps)

31:20.612 --> 31:21.948
-Can you sew him up?
-Okay.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.415
Yeah.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.217
Okay, okay.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.285
Here.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.619
Okay.

31:27.653 --> 31:28.754
Just hurry!

31:28.787 --> 31:30.289
-Okay.
-Hold it.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.697
One more.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.567
Okay.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.804
There, let me tighten...
okay, there.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.773
-Oh.
-(exhales)

31:47.806 --> 31:48.774
Okay.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.844
(gasping quiets)

31:52.878 --> 31:54.680
-Is he gonna be okay?
-CAITLIN: I think so.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.248
I think he'll be all right.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.516
We did it.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.151
So cool.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.020
(sighs)

32:07.826 --> 32:09.661
Dad's not going to believe this.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.708
OFFICER:
I'm two blocks away.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.176
ETA 45 seconds.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.944
The police are getting closer.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.446
It should be okay.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.880
Fade's supposed to pick him up
at the next intersection.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.922
(siren wailing in distance)

32:41.027 --> 32:42.928
No, no, no, come on.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.798
Where are you?

32:46.832 --> 32:49.101
(siren approaching)

32:50.902 --> 32:51.870
OFFICER 2:
Suspect spotted,

32:51.903 --> 32:53.239
heading towards
the corner of Elm.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.473
SAGE:
They're right on top of him.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.874
(siren wailing)

33:00.879 --> 33:02.214
(tires screeching)

33:07.686 --> 33:08.720
Freeze! Police!

33:10.022 --> 33:11.723
(loud bang)

33:11.757 --> 33:12.958
(gunshots)

33:16.395 --> 33:17.596
What the hell was that?!

33:17.629 --> 33:19.931
Just making sure whose side
you're really on.

33:19.965 --> 33:20.966
Suspect is fleeing.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.805
I repeat, suspect is fleeing.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.311
Secure the area!
Do a sweep.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.786
What's the word?

33:40.819 --> 33:43.089
All we know is Agent Turner's
inside with hostiles.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.057
No word how many
or what they want.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.592
You tried making contact?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.560
They're not talking to us.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.598
Then we're going in
for a face-to-face.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.066
Prep your team for a breach.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.867
Yes, sir.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.536
Prepare to breach, all units.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.538
It looks like they're
getting ready to move in.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.707
Can you get us out of here
if things escalate?

34:01.740 --> 34:03.742
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

34:03.775 --> 34:06.212
Dude, FYI, it's a bit more
taxing tearing holes into space

34:06.245 --> 34:07.579
than it is turning your hands

34:07.613 --> 34:09.981
-into flashlights.
-Point taken.

34:10.015 --> 34:12.151
POLARIS:
He knows what they did to Pulse.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.452
He doesn't want to share.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.954
Okay, I'll see
what I can find out.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.090
I'm warning you,

34:18.124 --> 34:20.826
whatever you're planning
on doing, this is assault

34:20.859 --> 34:22.094
on a federal officer.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.329
Hmm.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.098
Don't worry, handsome.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.967
You won't feel a thing.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.939
OFFICER:
Come on, guys, stay close.

34:33.972 --> 34:34.940
COMMANDER:
Move in.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.075
ECLIPSE:
Oh, hey.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.244
Hey, they're moving.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.678
Now, we are running out of time.

34:39.711 --> 34:42.681
Then I'll buy us some more.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.622
(metal clanking, creaking)

35:06.705 --> 35:07.873
WEEKS:
Everybody down!

35:10.008 --> 35:11.343
We have to do something here.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.878
COMMANDER:
Sir, we can't go in.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.146
It's too dangerous.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.415
Then we make them come out.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.086
JACE: Out of the car
with your hands up!

35:23.722 --> 35:24.990
-(Jace grunting)
-ECLIPSE: Lorna!

35:28.994 --> 35:31.263
(gasps)

35:49.181 --> 35:50.549
WEEKS:
Get ready, everyone.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.889
Weapons ready. Firing.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.027
Watch out!

36:03.895 --> 36:05.831
Tear gas!

36:05.864 --> 36:08.534
(all coughing)

36:08.567 --> 36:09.835
-Marcos.
-You okay?

36:09.868 --> 36:11.002
POLARIS:
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.103
BLINK:
Is she done?

36:12.137 --> 36:13.572
POLARIS:
Sonya, Sonya! Come on.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.541
(both coughing)

36:19.711 --> 36:20.512
(screams)

36:20.546 --> 36:22.414
(grunting)

36:22.448 --> 36:24.283
Move in, now!

36:24.316 --> 36:27.219
Go, go, go!

36:27.253 --> 36:29.721
Hurry! This way!

36:29.755 --> 36:32.090
Sonya! No, come on!

36:32.123 --> 36:34.025
It's too late!
Come on! Come on!

36:34.059 --> 36:35.261
Wait! Lorna!

36:35.294 --> 36:37.596
I can't leave him like this!

36:37.629 --> 36:39.898
(Jace screaming)

36:44.002 --> 36:45.337
(grunts)

36:52.278 --> 36:53.479
(giggles)

36:53.512 --> 36:55.113
(screaming)

37:05.257 --> 37:08.226
-What do you think?
-About what?

37:08.260 --> 37:10.996
Well, Agent Turner
definitely knew Pulse.

37:11.029 --> 37:14.165
It's hazy,
but there was a building

37:14.199 --> 37:17.703
and some documents
and, uh, a logo.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.073
I-I did my best.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.109
You know what this is?

37:24.142 --> 37:25.944
I don't recognize that.

37:25.977 --> 37:29.147
I do.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.782
This was on our friend's arm.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.552
It was like a tattoo or a brand.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.592
You know that place?

37:40.626 --> 37:44.262
That's the Federal Building
in Baton Rouge.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.598
Some people I prosecuted
were transferred there.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.600
-What happened to 'em?
-I don't know.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.702
They disappeared.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.288
(chuckles softly)

38:10.322 --> 38:12.223
Do you want some dinner?

38:12.257 --> 38:15.794
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.829
Ugh.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.232
Madam.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.402
(laughs)

38:23.435 --> 38:25.303
All this looks great.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.304
Mmm.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.639
Yeah. If you told me

38:27.673 --> 38:30.676
three weeks ago
I would be this happy to eat

38:30.709 --> 38:33.178
a rib-shaped
barbecue pork patty,

38:33.211 --> 38:34.513
I would have said
you were insane.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.514
(laughter)

38:35.547 --> 38:37.349
You know what?

38:37.383 --> 38:39.217
It's not bad.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.720
Mm. It's terrible.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.188
(all chuckling)

38:43.221 --> 38:46.725
This is the best terrible meal
I have ever had.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.927
ANDY:
So, what now?

38:48.960 --> 38:50.896
Are-are we going to Mexico
or whatever?

38:54.032 --> 38:56.001
I mean, I thought
that was the plan.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.503
Was to leave the country.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.405
I heard Cancún's pretty cool.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.506
CAITLIN:
Well, I don't think

39:00.539 --> 39:03.742
we have to worry about
any of it just yet.

39:03.775 --> 39:04.876
It's still not safe to travel.

39:04.910 --> 39:05.811
REED:
It's not just that.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.881
I've been talking
to some of the people here,

39:09.915 --> 39:14.085
and they have questions
about the Sentinel Services

39:14.119 --> 39:16.287
and what they're doing, and...

39:16.321 --> 39:18.624
I can help them with that.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.058
LAUREN:
So, we're just...

39:20.091 --> 39:23.094
here.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.531
Right now, yeah.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.365
But you guys

39:27.399 --> 39:29.835
and your mom...

39:31.169 --> 39:33.071
...you saved lives today.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.445
They can use us here.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.449
The most important thing

39:43.482 --> 39:46.117
is we are all together.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.455
Right?

39:51.189 --> 39:52.691
(chuckles softly)

39:56.828 --> 39:58.830
CAITLIN:
Mmm-mmm.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.603
Hey.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.971
I need to talk to you.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.673
Did you mess with my head?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.775
What do you mean?

40:09.808 --> 40:11.510
I was watching you with
the Sentinel Services guy.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.911
And then I remembered something.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.980
Last week, the two of us started
to have a conversation,

40:15.013 --> 40:16.982
and now that conversation's
just gone.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.917
And now I can't go
ten minutes without

40:18.950 --> 40:22.120
this memory of John
coming back to me.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.855
I'm asking you straight up,

40:23.889 --> 40:26.892
did you mess with my head?

40:31.162 --> 40:33.164
You couldn't use your abilities.

40:33.198 --> 40:36.034
Johnny was in trouble,
and if you were gonna help,

40:36.067 --> 40:37.268
you-you needed
a connection to him.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.470
You had no right.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.538
Were you ever gonna tell me?

40:39.571 --> 40:41.039
Look, I know that you're angry,

40:41.072 --> 40:43.842
but you have to understand,
people's lives were at stake.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.010
I don't have
to understand anything.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.945
What you do is wrong.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.515
You decided that
you needed to fix me,

40:49.548 --> 40:51.216
and now I get to live
with the memory

40:51.249 --> 40:53.652
of loving someone I barely know.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.554
Someone who doesn't love me.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.557
I can take it away if you want.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.058
I can remove the memory...

41:00.091 --> 41:02.928
Just stay away from me.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.037
(vehicle approaches)

41:22.447 --> 41:24.650
-(Paula sighs)
-Hey.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.685
-(vehicle departs)
-Come here.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.719
Oh, God.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.888
I was so worried.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.223
I wanted to come and see you,
but they wouldn't let me.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.726
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.597
They had to debrief me
and check me out and all that.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.899
Just kind of took a while.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.834
Are you... are you all right?

41:42.868 --> 41:43.935
-Yeah.
-They said that...

41:43.969 --> 41:46.504
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm-I'm...

41:46.538 --> 41:49.040
a little scrambled,
but I'm-I'm good.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.876
I'm good.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.443
All right?

41:53.579 --> 41:55.480
Grace wait up for me?

41:57.482 --> 41:59.284
Come on, I know it's late.

41:59.317 --> 42:02.087
I just want to tuck her in,
read her a little Frog and Toad.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.922
Jace...

42:03.955 --> 42:07.458
you want to talk
to our daughter?

42:07.492 --> 42:10.629
Why are you looking
at me like that?

42:15.066 --> 42:16.434
Oh, God.

42:19.971 --> 42:23.408
Oh, God.
What did they do to you?

42:23.441 --> 42:25.777
Baby.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.613
You're freaking me out.
What's going on?

42:27.646 --> 42:28.947
Where's Grace?

42:28.980 --> 42:30.916
Grace is gone.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.383
What do you mean?

42:32.417 --> 42:33.451
We lost her.

42:36.588 --> 42:39.224
We lost our baby.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.660
Why would you say that?

42:43.595 --> 42:45.797
We lost our little girl.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.802
That's...

42:50.836 --> 42:52.503
Grace is dead!

42:54.606 --> 42:57.375
She died four years ago.

43:01.012 --> 43:03.248
What did they do to me?

43:03.281 --> 43:04.616
I don't...

43:04.650 --> 43:05.817
That's not possible.

43:05.851 --> 43:07.786
-She's gone, Jace!
-Baby...

43:09.855 --> 43:11.823
Don't say that.

43:11.857 --> 43:13.524
That we lost her.

43:13.558 --> 43:15.026
No. No.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.995
She... she's gone.

43:20.632 --> 43:22.333
(crying)

43:29.007 --> 43:32.010
(sobbing):
