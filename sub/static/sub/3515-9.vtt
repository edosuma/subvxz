00:03.560 --> 00:06.370
Zip-lining in Kauai.
Tore my Achilles.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.530
Who is the unlucky man?

00:11.600 --> 00:13.523
ADALIND: It's one of two,

00:13.600 --> 00:15.728
and they happen to be brothers.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.847
You wanted to see us?

00:16.920 --> 00:18.570
Gonna be leaving
town for a little while.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.720
You in some kind of danger?

Juliette, it's Alicia.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.607

It's Joe.

I gotta get out of here, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.601
I'm leaving him.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.687
Okay, then you need to come,
and you're staying with us.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.050
I'm just afraid of what he'll
do when he finds out I left.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.645
All right,
you need to get in the car

01:52.800 --> 01:54.325
and come to Portland right now.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.927
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.200
No, listen, it's gonna be okay,

02:00.240 --> 02:01.446
but you have to
get out of there.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.285
All right, so get in the car
and call me from the road.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.600

Yep.

You're not sweating.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.801
I know. Weird, isn't it?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.723
My friend Alicia just called.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.483
Alicia who's
married to that idiot?

02:32.560 --> 02:34.050
Joe, and yes.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.084
She needs a place to stay.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.000
He hit her again.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.526
Well, did she report it?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.924
No, I think she's too
scared to do anything

02:44.000 --> 02:46.162
besides just get out
of there right now.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.241
Do you want me to get into it?

02:47.360 --> 02:49.806
No, not yet. Not until we
have a chance to talk to her.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.882
I just wanted you
to know she's coming.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.371
She can stay here as
long as she needs to,

02:53.440 --> 02:54.965
but you have to make sure
she does not talk to Joe

02:55.040 --> 02:56.201
while she's here.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.924
He cannot know where she is.

we like each other.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.681
Why are you in Vienna?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.171
Did you miss me?

03:32.240 --> 03:33.810
I did, actually.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.004
Who put cameras in my room?

03:39.080 --> 03:40.411
Who's paying your hotel bills?

03:40.480 --> 03:41.561
Eric was.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.165
You're still here.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.563
You know, the Family,

03:46.640 --> 03:49.530
they get very paranoid when
one of their own gets killed.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.762
So they're spying on me.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.444
Well, anything to hide?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.164
What's left to hide?

03:55.240 --> 03:57.288
Nothing,
if they know you're pregnant.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.404
See, there's a rumor
going around

04:00.480 --> 04:02.847
that's someone's trying to
sell a child with royal blood.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.008

Is it?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.521
You worried about
paying child support?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.603

04:22.920 --> 04:24.968
you're going to
have to choose a side.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.886
See, everyone will be
interested in that child

04:27.960 --> 04:30.167
but not so much you.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.243
You don't have that many
friends you can trust,

04:33.320 --> 04:34.685
if any.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.006
We were short-staffed.
I got busy.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.569
We were closed
for a private party.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.880
You have a guest list?

15:10.960 --> 15:13.645
The woman who booked the party
is a personal friend,

15:13.720 --> 15:15.290
Mila Guryanova.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.442
I can give you her number.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.050
Staff get along with Markov?

15:19.160 --> 15:20.685
As far as I know.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.684
Show us your surveillance.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.490
This is the guy we
think killed the waiter.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.767
He knows there's cameras. That's
why he's carrying the box.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.569
And this is him
10 minutes later.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.323
RENARD: Is that the storeroom?
Yeah.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.289
He goes in,
never comes back out.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.330
So he kills the waiter, steals the uniform.
What's the motive?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.564
This guy.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.449
Boris Myshkin, guest of honor.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.490
HANK: The killer must have needed
the uniform as a disguise.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.371
Myshkin?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.161
I've heard of him. He's some
sort of Russian healer.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.651
Sounds like a scam artist to me.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.881
According to
the restaurant owner,

15:54.960 --> 15:57.930
Myshkin is staying with
this woman, Mila Guryanova.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.722
And this is his wife Olga.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.570
How does Olga feel about them?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.769
HANK:
What, his groupies?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.042
Doubt she calls 'em that.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.929
Any idea who the assailant is?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.685
Not yet, lab's still trying
to clean up the image.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.886
And no one reported the assault?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.126
NICK: No.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.642
We believe Myshkin threw
his attacker out the window.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.484
NICK: And he went back to the
party like nothing happened.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.483
So the guy who attacked him
could still be on the loose.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.846
If someone tried
to kill Myshkin,

16:27.920 --> 16:29.729
there's no reason to think
he won't try it again.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.649
We need to talk to Myshkin.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.330

Russian citizens.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.004
If the State Department
decides to get involved,

16:35.080 --> 16:36.889

kill somebody you hate,

20:58.040 --> 20:59.849
it certainly fits the occasion.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.611
Any reason why this man
hates you enough to kill you?

21:04.920 --> 21:07.526
Many. Many reasons.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.922
Sometimes,

21:11.040 --> 21:14.806
sometimes I try to
heal someone, and I fail.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.451

He ran away.

murdered someone, I would've.

The skin on Myshkin's hand
became transparent

22:18.920 --> 22:20.285
when he was healing that kid.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.606
I could see his bones.

No, no, but what you're
describing is a Koschei.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.841
I remember meeting one once
with my mother in Moscow.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.048
He was a healer
just like Myshkin.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.603
He wore these long monk's
robes, he didn't drink,

22:33.680 --> 22:36.047
and according to my mother,
he was celibate,

22:36.120 --> 22:37.246
which is why he came to her.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.721
Evidently, the healing
fired up his sex drive,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.689
and he needed a potion
to put the brakes on.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.684
Myshkin's libido could use some of that.

Doesn't seem to be suffering too
much guilt about his marriage.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.081
HANK: Yeah, me too.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.962
Room's registered
to an Alex Renko.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.806
Manager said he paid in cash, but
he had a Moscow driver's license.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.086
NICK: Another Russian.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.440
Got something here.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.485
Markov's uniform
from the restaurant.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.211
So the dead guy in the tub killed
the waiter and attacked Myshkin.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.883
That's some badass justice.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.126
Got a cell phone over here.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.049
Looks like a burner.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.130
All the calls are
to the same number.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.770
Could be an accomplice.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.729
NICK: Let's see who he
was talking to.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.610
The number you have reached
is no longer in service...

27:30.680 --> 27:32.569
I guess
the accomplice is not stupid.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.683
HazMat's here.
They said don't touch the...

27:45.240 --> 27:48.210
Sorry, detectives, but you
have to be decontaminated.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.449
You'll surrender your clothes
and undergo exfoliation.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.521
Exfoliation?

27:54.600 --> 27:56.364
That means
you'll have to shower.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.522
You'll also need to
take potassium iodide.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.761
Anyone allergic?

28:00.080 --> 28:01.764
MAN: Let's get some
swabs off the victim.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.490
Seal off the other room.

28:07.240 --> 28:10.050
I've had to take a few cold showers
before, but nothing like this.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.849
Can't believe soap and water's
gonna be enough.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.246
Scrub hard.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.526
How long you
think it takes before

28:14.640 --> 28:15.880
you show signs of
radiation sickness?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.689
That depends on
the level of exposure.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.690
Killer must have got
a pretty high dose, I hope.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.723
Well, he didn't look sick on
the restaurant surveillance.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.768
Not before he walked
into the storeroom anyway.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.002
That must have been
where he got exposed.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.048
And by exposed you mean...

28:29.120 --> 28:30.884
To Myshkin.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.169
We better tell them to check
out the restaurant storeroom.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.282
That's pretty hot over here.

your potassium iodide.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.611

28:55.720 --> 28:57.051
They have to be incinerated.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.963
You're lucky,
could've been a lot worse.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.520
Just heard back from our team
at the restaurant.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.011
You were right.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.605

29:23.640 --> 29:25.085
You okay?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.531
They cleared us.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.880
We feel like idiots.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.210
No comment. So...

29:30.760 --> 29:31.966
What do we know
about our suspect?

29:32.080 --> 29:33.206
So far, just his name.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.280
Alex Renko.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.327
They've got him in isolation.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.050
He's dying of
radiation poisoning.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.964
Had to be Myshkin.
He's definitely a Koschei.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.884
We found out they can kill
or cure with their touch.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.041
Fits with what I got.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.327
Turns out Myshkin was
a paid assassin for the FSB.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.641
Sounds like his sins
have come back to haunt him.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.529
Let's bring him in,
see what he'll admit to.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.843
You shouldn't have come here.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.051
I told you,

30:11.240 --> 30:13.288
I don't want this for you.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.123
You have to leave him.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.529
He Will kill you 1100.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.608
If you really want to keep Gizmo
from getting into fights,

30:37.680 --> 30:39.364
you have got to neuter him.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.563
I know,
but my husband won't let me.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.529
Well, he's probably gonna
be out for another hour,

30:44.600 --> 30:46.284
so if you want to get
coffee or anything...

30:46.360 --> 30:47.691
Are you sure he'll be okay?

30:47.760 --> 30:50.286
Yeah, he'll be fine
until the next time.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.203
I should just
neuter you anyway, Gizmo,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.163

pain and suffering.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.561
Go ahead. I won't tell.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.165

31:05.000 --> 31:07.002
It wouldn't be that difficult,
would it?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.650
I mean, a cat,

31:08.760 --> 31:09.761
A man...
Joe.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.889
That's terrible, to
even think about doing that

31:12.960 --> 31:16.009
in the middle of the night when
he's drunk and passed out,

31:16.080 --> 31:18.048
say, like, on a Friday, 9:30,

31:18.120 --> 31:20.327
and we had a really,
really good alibi.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.487
You know you can never go back.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.641
Yeah, I know.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.440

31:30.960 --> 31:33.327
It's Friday at
9:30 and we have a...

Really good alibi.
Really good alibi.

You know a man named Alex Renko?

31:38.840 --> 31:40.046
Should I?

31:40.120 --> 31:42.168
You poisoned him with
radiation two days ago.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.201
And you used to
work for the FSB.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.645
We know you're a Koschei.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.489

32:13.240 --> 32:15.811

32:18.120 --> 32:19.121
No.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.282
It's a long story.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.771
Why did Renko want you killed?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.004
I promise you I don't know.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.922
I'm sorry for what
I did to that man.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.401
He attacked me.
I had no choice.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.610
Yes, I was assassin for the FSB.

32:37.440 --> 32:41.729
But I wanted to find peace and do
penance for the pain I caused,

32:43.440 --> 32:46.967
so I swore an oath to
God to only do good,

32:47.040 --> 32:48.485
heal the sick.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.800
My concern is not
your redemption.

32:49.880 --> 32:53.805
My concern is that Renko has an
accomplice who may still be after you.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.247
I'm already a dead man, Mister.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.971
And every time I heal,
I die a little more.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.084
If someone tries to kill me,
I'm not gonna fight it again.

murdered his father.

she's related to Alex.

someone at the house,

Mysha, Mysha! Don't, don't!

39:39.880 --> 39:42.486
It will kill you.
You are too weak.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.011
No!

39:54.680 --> 39:55.966
(SOBBING) No!

40:00.560 --> 40:01.800
You fool.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.481
Forgive me.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.368
You fool.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.329
This is Burkhardt.
We need an ambulance.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.050
3500 Lovejoy.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.085
JULIETTE: Nick?
Yeah.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.810
We're in the kitchen.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.924
Are you hungry?
We saved you a plate.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.645
Mm. Thanks.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.209
How'd it go today?
JULIETTE: It was fun.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.806
Alicia came to work with me and
helped treat cats and dogs.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.245
And one parrot.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.691
His name was, uh...

40:37.760 --> 40:39.728
Beauregard.
Beauregard.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.529
He was pretty chatty.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.443
So you had a good day?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.249
Yeah, yeah. I did.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.163
Look, guys, I know
this is such an imposition,

40:50.240 --> 40:51.844
and I promise you that...
Will you stop?

40:51.920 --> 40:53.081
She's been doing this all day.
(PHONE RINGING)

40:53.160 --> 40:54.844
I'll get the phone.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.041
So has Joe tried
calling again today?

40:59.360 --> 41:00.850
I turned off my phone.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.240
That's good.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.320
She's not here, Joe.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.169
I don't know where she is.
She's not here.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.810
No, you're not
hearing what I'm saying.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.564
Let me talk to him.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.005
Joe, it's Nick.
You don't want to do this.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.565
I'm looking for my wife!

41:14.960 --> 41:17.486
This is none of
your damn business, Detective.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.483
Well, I'm not talking
to you as a cop, yet.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.800
You need to calm down.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.160
The hell I do! Is she there?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.651
Just tell me if she's there.

41:23.720 --> 41:24.881
Damn it, I know she's there!

41:25.000 --> 41:27.890
If Alicia left you, I'm sure she
did it for a pretty good reason.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.200
Do you want to tell me about it?

41:29.240 --> 41:30.241
(LINE CLICKS)

41:30.320 --> 41:31.560
Joe.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.760
He hung up.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.046
Does he know that I'm here?

41:40.120 --> 41:41.760
He's probably calling
all of your friends.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.280
If he knows that I'm here,
then he will come here.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.805
Well,
then we'll just deal with it.

41:45.880 --> 41:49.009
Look, Nick, you don't...
You don't understand, okay?

41:49.080 --> 41:50.411
He's...

41:52.320 --> 41:53.924
He's not normal.

41:55.640 --> 41:59.884
Well, let's hope he's normal
enough not to do anything stupid.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.125
(GROWLS)
