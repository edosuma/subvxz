WEBVTT

00:10.977 --> 00:14.097
Tonight, Richard opens a glove box,

00:14.097 --> 00:16.216
James pulls a face,

00:16.216 --> 00:18.417
and I ask an important question.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.057
Have you ever put
toothpaste on your testicles?

00:21.057 --> 00:23.577
APPLAUSE

00:27.297 --> 00:29.497
Thank you. Hello. Good evening!

00:29.497 --> 00:31.537
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:31.537 --> 00:34.817
It is a big crowd tonight.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.777
Thanks very much. Thank you. Now...

00:37.777 --> 00:41.377
last year, the big three
German car-makers,

00:41.377 --> 00:44.377
Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW,

00:44.377 --> 00:47.537
all brought out new hot hatchbacks.

00:47.537 --> 00:50.457
And since this is a top consumer
programme

00:50.457 --> 00:52.737
full of helpful buying advice,

00:52.737 --> 00:57.577
I thought it would be a good idea
to see which one of them is best.

01:02.697 --> 01:06.017
Well, not the Mercedes,
that's for sure.

01:07.217 --> 01:11.897
This is the new four-wheel-drive
A45 and it's extremely powerful...

01:13.177 --> 01:17.177
extremely nice to drive
and handsome as well.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.977
But it is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

01:23.017 --> 01:27.537
This car, with a few
options on it, is ã46,000 and that,

01:27.537 --> 01:30.577
for a hatchback, is idiotic.

01:30.577 --> 01:33.337
It's like charging 100 quid
for a sardine.

01:33.337 --> 01:35.977
"Oh, it is a very good sardine,
sir." I don't care how good it is.

01:35.977 --> 01:37.857
I'm not paying 100 quid for a fish.

01:39.977 --> 01:42.937
If, then, you have even half
a droplet of common sense,

01:42.937 --> 01:47.137
you will be choosing
between these two.

01:47.137 --> 01:49.297
The BMW M135...

01:50.777 --> 01:54.577
and Volkswagen's latest Golf GTI.

01:54.577 --> 01:57.497
Both cost around ã30,000.

01:58.537 --> 02:01.617
Both are available with three
or five doors.

02:02.617 --> 02:05.417
Both come as standard
with many things.

02:07.097 --> 02:12.617
And both will be as reliable and as
long-lasting as Edinburgh Castle.

02:12.617 --> 02:15.417
You might think, then,
that they are pretty similar.

02:15.417 --> 02:18.177
But they're not,
which is why I am in the BMW.

02:18.177 --> 02:22.217
You see, the Golf has a two-litre
four-cylinder

02:22.217 --> 02:25.977
turbocharged engine
and that's very nice.

02:25.977 --> 02:32.017
But the BMW has a three-litre
six-cylinder turbocharged engine.

02:32.017 --> 02:34.537
And that's even nicer.

02:38.337 --> 02:40.577
Yes, the Golf is lighter.

02:41.857 --> 02:46.657
But that is not enough to offset
the 90-horsepower disadvantage.

02:48.217 --> 02:51.417
A point I shall now demonstrate
with a small race.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.857 --> 03:03.537
Front-wheel drive Golf is
clinging on jolly well

03:03.537 --> 03:05.817
but frankly, it's pointless.

03:09.257 --> 03:13.297
I can overtake any time I like.
I have the power.

03:17.097 --> 03:21.057
And I have an eight-speed gearbox
compared to his paltry six.

03:21.977 --> 03:24.817
Yes, the Prussian aristocrat

03:24.817 --> 03:28.937
is trampling all over
the lumpen people's car.

03:34.857 --> 03:37.417
There we go. Power!

03:37.417 --> 03:39.057
Come on!

03:40.177 --> 03:42.857
And there we are in front.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.977
'The BMW, then, really is very
fast.'

03:49.617 --> 03:53.617
What's more, because this is
the first hot hatchback

03:53.617 --> 03:58.977
for 30 years to have rear-wheel
drive, you can do this.

04:03.737 --> 04:06.297
HE LAUGHS

04:06.297 --> 04:08.217
Whoo-ha!

04:09.457 --> 04:12.497
'So far, then, the BMW is running
rings round the Golf.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.737
'But I then line them up for
a simple straight-line drag race.

04:20.897 --> 04:23.497
'And there was a problem.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.257
'A big one.'

04:25.257 --> 04:27.137
Three...

04:27.137 --> 04:28.817
two...

04:28.817 --> 04:30.257
one!

04:30.257 --> 04:34.137
ENGINES ROAR

04:38.577 --> 04:39.817
Good noise!

04:44.617 --> 04:48.337
With this in reverse...

04:49.977 --> 04:52.617
'At this point,
I was feeling confident.

04:52.617 --> 04:55.017
'But, as I hit 120mph...'

04:56.017 --> 04:57.377
This really is...

04:57.377 --> 04:58.897
Oh, BLEEP BLEEP!

04:58.897 --> 05:02.217
CLUNKING AND RATTLING

05:16.537 --> 05:20.577
Yeah, you see, the Golf won that
because this, well, it lost control.

05:21.977 --> 05:24.257
That's what happened there.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.697
Whoo!

05:27.857 --> 05:30.617
'After this incident,
I switched to the Golf GTI.

05:33.377 --> 05:38.457
'And I decided immediately it was
a lot better in every single way.

05:38.457 --> 05:41.697
'Not only was it able to travel
in a straight line

05:41.697 --> 05:43.697
'without spinning off..,

05:43.697 --> 05:45.897
'but, thanks to its smaller engine,

05:45.897 --> 05:48.257
'it is a lot more economical
than the BMW.

05:48.257 --> 05:50.857
'And a lot cheaper to insure.'

05:50.857 --> 05:54.297
In fact, because Volkswagen has
fitted this with a forward-facing

05:54.297 --> 05:58.657
radar system that won't let
you have a low-speed crash,

05:58.657 --> 06:05.177
this GTI is in an insurance group
five down from the previous model.

06:05.177 --> 06:09.817
It would be more expensive
to insure a pencil sharpener.

06:09.817 --> 06:12.337
'So the GTI is cheaper to run
and cheaper to buy

06:12.337 --> 06:15.337
'and much better in
a straight line than the BMW.

06:16.737 --> 06:19.937
'But what if you want to transport
a nuclear warhead?'

06:21.417 --> 06:26.137
Well, what we have got here in the
boot of the Volkswagen is a warhead.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.697
And as you can see,
it fits perfectly.

06:28.697 --> 06:35.737
But will it fit in the boot
of the BMW?

06:35.737 --> 06:39.777
Oh, dear. Oh, dearie me.

06:41.177 --> 06:45.177
See, this is the problem really with
rear-wheel drive.

06:45.177 --> 06:46.617
It does rob space.

06:46.617 --> 06:49.137
So you would have to
drive along like that.

06:49.137 --> 06:53.137
And somebody is going to notice.
Hans Blick is, for sure.

06:54.257 --> 06:58.817
'Things are much the same
when it comes to space in the cabin.

06:58.817 --> 07:02.057
'The Golf can handle three
people on the back seat easily.'

07:03.177 --> 07:06.617
But the only way you're going to get
three people in the back

07:06.617 --> 07:10.457
of the BMW is by sawing
their legs off with a hammer.

07:12.657 --> 07:16.177
This is not only
complicated and messy

07:16.177 --> 07:20.857
but, in Britain at least,
it's currently against the law.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.257
Come on! The bone!

07:28.577 --> 07:32.417
One... It's probably easier
to buy the Golf, really.

07:34.097 --> 07:36.417
'So the Golf is cheaper
to buy and cheaper to run

07:36.417 --> 07:39.097
'and also more practical
than the BMW.'

07:42.257 --> 07:45.857
But it's like driving around
in James May's sock drawer.

07:45.857 --> 07:51.017
Everything is exactly where you
would expect it to be. Organised.

07:51.017 --> 07:55.657
Blue ones, brown ones,
pink ones for special occasions.

07:55.657 --> 07:58.457
'Don't think, however,
because it is sensible and practical

07:58.457 --> 08:02.497
'and economical, that it's
in any way boring.' Look.

08:02.497 --> 08:05.497
The gear lever is
a sort of golf ball shape.

08:05.497 --> 08:08.177
You see, you Englishers,
you have the ze Monty Python

08:08.177 --> 08:09.977
and ze Harry and ze Paul

08:09.977 --> 08:13.737
but ve have a sense of humour
also with this. Ja?

08:15.137 --> 08:16.697
'There's more as well.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.577
'Because this particular car
is fitted with Volkswagen's

08:19.577 --> 08:21.217
'optional performance pack.

08:23.457 --> 08:29.537
'That means better brakes,
more power. A top speed of 155mph.

08:29.537 --> 08:32.857
'And a trick front differential.'

08:32.857 --> 08:35.857
Now we have seen clever
front differentials before

08:35.857 --> 08:38.616
but nothing like this.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.657
My foot is hard down now.

08:40.657 --> 08:42.977
Coming round Hammerhead.

08:45.937 --> 08:49.097
And there's no torque steer,
there's no understeer...

08:52.937 --> 08:55.537
You can feel the whole car being
dragged in,

08:55.537 --> 08:57.737
pulled towards the apex.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.497
I've never felt anything like it.

09:03.777 --> 09:07.697
A baboon could get this around here
as fast as the Stig.

09:16.217 --> 09:20.257
'So there we are. These two
cars are not the same at all.

09:20.257 --> 09:23.257
'One is brilliant in every way.

09:23.257 --> 09:25.937
'And the other tried to kill me.'

09:28.537 --> 09:30.577
APPLAUSE

09:32.097 --> 09:33.937
Very interesting.

09:33.937 --> 09:37.297
Plainly the car to have there.
Oh, yes. Really fascinating.

09:37.297 --> 09:42.177
Just some questions raised.
Let's get this straight.

09:42.177 --> 09:44.017
You don't like the BMW.

09:44.017 --> 09:47.497
Because you can't drive
in a straight line.

09:48.537 --> 09:50.657
Hark who's talking!

09:51.697 --> 09:56.417
How fast did you say you were going?
120mph.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.297
Walking pace, basically.

09:58.297 --> 10:02.697
Listen, from the point where
it suddenly snapped sideways for no

10:02.697 --> 10:05.657
reason, to the point where it
stopped moving, we measured it.

10:05.657 --> 10:07.577
It was over a quarter of a mile.

10:07.577 --> 10:09.537
I could have held it, I reckon.

10:09.537 --> 10:11.857
Could you? You just aquaplaned.

10:11.857 --> 10:14.617
Yes, but the Golf was on the same
track in the same conditions

10:14.617 --> 10:16.617
and it didn't aquaplane.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.057
Now, the Golf didn't aquaplane
because you weren't driving it.

10:21.417 --> 10:24.497
Yes, but, Hammond,
all things considered,

10:24.497 --> 10:28.577
the Golf is a better car.
Is it? It is, honestly.

10:28.577 --> 10:30.337
The diff in it is remarkable.

10:30.337 --> 10:33.297
Because you know when you go round
a corner in a car,

10:33.297 --> 10:35.817
you go like that, yeah?
And it wants to push out.

10:35.817 --> 10:38.857
Well, in this,
the faster you go, it comes in.

10:38.857 --> 10:41.977
It's like Volkswagen has worked out
a way to reverse centrifugal force.

10:41.977 --> 10:45.737
Ah, so Volkswagen have broken
science. Yes. With a diff?

10:45.737 --> 10:47.377
Yes.

10:47.377 --> 10:51.297
And now, we must find out how fast
these cars go round our track.

10:51.297 --> 10:55.297
And that, of course, means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

10:55.297 --> 11:00.977
Some say that his hair is
the exact same shape as a hat.

11:03.297 --> 11:06.417
And that if he worked for CNN...

11:06.417 --> 11:09.417
LAUGHTER

11:09.417 --> 11:12.457
..he wouldn't get such pitifully
low ratings

11:12.457 --> 11:14.417
that his show got cancelled.

11:14.417 --> 11:18.177
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

11:22.377 --> 11:26.217
All we know is he is called
the Stig.

11:26.217 --> 11:27.537
And they're off.

11:27.537 --> 11:30.297
And for the first time this series,
it is actually dry.

11:30.297 --> 11:31.697
First straight.

11:31.697 --> 11:34.737
Will the BMW suddenly
spin off for no reason?

11:34.737 --> 11:37.817
No, it has actually made it
to the first corner. Amazing!

11:38.937 --> 11:42.497
Both turbocharged engines
loving this crisp dry air

11:42.497 --> 11:44.617
and no fuss so far.

11:44.617 --> 11:47.777
BIZARRE VOICES AND MUSIC

11:50.177 --> 11:51.577
No idea what that was.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.817
Right, through Chicago.

11:53.817 --> 11:56.537
Golf's traction control can't be
completely switched off.

11:56.537 --> 11:59.497
You can actually see it
nipping at the brakes on the way in.

11:59.497 --> 12:01.697
The BMW, of course,
just being stupid.

12:02.817 --> 12:05.737
Hammerhead -
no real dramas there either

12:05.737 --> 12:07.137
but the Golf - yes, its magic

12:07.137 --> 12:09.377
differential casually twisting
physics.

12:09.377 --> 12:11.617
MUSIC PLAYS

12:14.337 --> 12:18.657
Right, Follow Through and yes, the
BMW is trying to spin, of course.

12:18.657 --> 12:21.017
The Golf has a nibble of traction
control and then,

12:21.017 --> 12:22.337
faithful as a Labrador.

12:22.337 --> 12:24.777
Oh, the Golf brake lights flickering
there.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.857
That is the traction control turning
them on, not Stig, who is still

12:27.857 --> 12:32.057
fuming because I said a baboon could
drive as fast in the Golf as him.

12:32.057 --> 12:33.497
Right, just Gambon left.

12:33.497 --> 12:35.457
More hooliganism from the Beemer.

12:35.457 --> 12:36.777
And across the line!

12:36.777 --> 12:38.737
APPLAUSE

12:40.657 --> 12:42.457
I have the times here.

12:42.457 --> 12:46.017
Come on, then. The BMW...

12:46.017 --> 12:49.857
The BMW went round in 1.25.1

12:49.857 --> 12:52.857
so it is slower than the old
version,

12:52.857 --> 12:55.217
which did it on a damp track.

12:55.217 --> 12:56.777
So that's useless.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.337
And the Golf GTI did a 1.28.6.

12:59.337 --> 13:01.417
Look at that.

13:01.417 --> 13:05.257
That's a lot slower. Yes, yes, yes.
But look. Astra, Megane RS, Focus.

13:05.257 --> 13:08.697
It is right where hot hatchbacks
should be. This is just stupid.

13:08.697 --> 13:12.457
This is much better. And now we must
do the news. Yes, we must.

13:12.457 --> 13:15.217
Which is difficult, because that
means walking over there,

13:15.217 --> 13:18.017
which is a straight line.
You could spin off and lose it.

13:18.017 --> 13:20.857
Thank you, Hammond.
Don't slip. Careful. Here she comes.

13:20.857 --> 13:22.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
will he make it?

13:22.697 --> 13:24.697
Conditions are very
dry in the studio today.

13:24.697 --> 13:28.177
Oh, no, he has only got to step to
go. Shut up. Yes, he has done it.

13:28.177 --> 13:30.017
APPLAUSE

13:30.017 --> 13:31.857
I thought you were going off.

13:31.857 --> 13:34.017
Listen. It is a tricky
straight, that.

13:34.017 --> 13:39.417
It was easy because my
shoes were not made by BMW. Really.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.097
Good. Now. Do the news now, you two.

13:41.097 --> 13:42.737
The news, ladies and gentlemen.

13:42.737 --> 13:46.577
Now, last week you saw Richard
Hammond driving a six-wheeled

13:46.577 --> 13:49.697
Mercedes-Benz but did you know
they made another six-wheeled

13:49.697 --> 13:52.777
car long before that one? Like
to see a picture of it? Love to.

13:52.777 --> 13:54.577
Here it is.

13:54.577 --> 13:56.417
Oh, right.

13:56.417 --> 13:59.857
Did they not mention this, then?
Do you know, they didn't. How odd.

13:59.857 --> 14:02.137
It is, isn't it,
because Mercedes like to go on

14:02.137 --> 14:05.337
about their heritage and history
and they didn't mention that one.

14:05.337 --> 14:08.417
Well, perhaps they didn't mention it
because it has got Hitler in it.

14:08.417 --> 14:11.737
That is not Hitler. It is. It isn't.

14:11.737 --> 14:14.937
No, that car was built
long before indicators were invented

14:14.937 --> 14:17.177
so he is just the to do some
hand signals.

14:17.177 --> 14:19.497
What signal is he doing here,
then, James?

14:19.497 --> 14:22.537
He's saying, "Take the Third Reich."

14:22.537 --> 14:25.777
LAUGHTER AND GROANS

14:30.857 --> 14:35.617
Now. Have we got any Scottish
people here? Yes! Yes!

14:35.617 --> 14:39.097
Would you like to step outside just
for the next few minutes? Please.

14:39.097 --> 14:42.217
We've got a bit of a chat.
It's about Scottish independence.

14:42.217 --> 14:44.697
It's just that we've heard
a lot of talk in recent weeks

14:44.697 --> 14:47.777
about what Scotland would lose
if you choose to go on your own

14:47.777 --> 14:50.537
but nobody is talking about what
England would lose.

14:50.537 --> 14:52.817
And it is actually quite a lot.

14:52.817 --> 14:56.177
Because we would lose North Sea oil,
the sub base at Faslane,

14:56.177 --> 15:00.697
all tramps... Oh, God.
LAUGHTER

15:00.697 --> 15:05.137
And we'd also lose a significant
chunk of our motoring heritage

15:05.137 --> 15:07.457
and I'm not talking
about the Hillmans and Talbots

15:07.457 --> 15:09.937
that were made at the Linwood plant
just outside Paisley.

15:09.937 --> 15:11.897
No, I'm talking about stuff like

15:11.897 --> 15:14.697
the mighty Argyll,
Scotland's finest.

15:14.697 --> 15:16.777
Wow!
LAUGHTER

15:16.777 --> 15:18.617
Look at that MASTERPIECE!

15:18.617 --> 15:21.617
Do you know, when that car came out,
it was the same price

15:21.617 --> 15:26.057
as a Ferrari 308... Mm.
..and hardly anybody bought one?

15:26.057 --> 15:28.537
Really? It is remarkable
because you look at that...

15:28.537 --> 15:30.737
well, plastic body and you know...

15:30.737 --> 15:32.657
you just look at
the way the door fits.

15:32.657 --> 15:35.617
That is a quality product.
Isn't it? Isn't it? Oh, yeah.

15:35.617 --> 15:38.257
What engine did it have?
Ah, now, it's interesting.

15:38.257 --> 15:42.857
Engine-wise, you could have either
an engine from a Lancia,

15:42.857 --> 15:46.377
a Peugeot, Renault,
you could have a Buick V6...

15:46.377 --> 15:49.617
Basically, it was whatever turned up
in the scrap yard that week.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.377
Basically, yes. Planted in there.

15:51.377 --> 15:54.897
Well, actually, you could also have
it with the option of

15:54.897 --> 15:59.297
a turbocharged Rover V8 and
guess how many of those they sold?

15:59.297 --> 16:03.617
Was it none? Yes, it was none!
Absolutely none at all!

16:03.617 --> 16:06.217
And I have to say,
it wasn't just supercars

16:06.217 --> 16:07.977
where Scotland
was ahead of the game.

16:07.977 --> 16:10.417
They were ahead of the curve, also,
with electric cars

16:10.417 --> 16:13.657
because, way back in the day, they
made a little car called the Scamp.

16:13.657 --> 16:14.937
I've got a picture of it here.

16:14.937 --> 16:17.297
Wow!
LAUGHTER

16:17.297 --> 16:19.657
Great Scott!
LAUGHTER

16:19.657 --> 16:22.377
That still has the power to take
your breath away, even today.

16:22.377 --> 16:27.017
It does. Doesn't it just? It's...
It's a rather tragic story, though.

16:27.017 --> 16:29.977
It was made of aluminium and wood
and it was going to be sold

16:29.977 --> 16:33.737
through Electricity Board showrooms,
which I remember, actually.

16:33.737 --> 16:35.937
But when they took it to the
government test centre

16:35.937 --> 16:39.057
to get a road-worthiness certificate
before they could put it on sale,

16:39.057 --> 16:40.937
there was a bit of a problem.

16:40.937 --> 16:44.737
In one test,
the government engineer noted -

16:44.737 --> 16:47.337
and I've written
all the problems, here, down -

16:47.337 --> 16:50.097
"The speedo broke,
the electric motor stopped working,

16:50.097 --> 16:52.857
"the back door flew open,
the spare wheel fell out,

16:52.857 --> 16:56.377
"the steering went wrong
and then the suspension snapped."

16:56.377 --> 16:58.257
LAUGHTER

16:58.257 --> 17:00.057
And that was the end of that. Aw!

17:00.057 --> 17:02.777
And yet it looked so full of promise,
didn't it, there?

17:02.777 --> 17:04.497
LAUGHTER

17:04.497 --> 17:07.857
Now, I drove my Mercedes
down to the track this morning

17:07.857 --> 17:10.896
and, genuinely, the most
extraordinary thing happened.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.696
It didn't catch fire.

17:12.696 --> 17:14.097
Really?
LAUGHTER

17:14.097 --> 17:18.537
Now, James, you came down in your
Fiat Panda, did you not? Yes.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.537
Did that catch fire?
Let me just think. No. Did it not?

17:21.537 --> 17:25.017
No, it didn't at all. Richard, the
hire car you came down in... Yes?!

17:25.017 --> 17:27.457
..did that burst into flames?
No, it didn't. Did it not?

17:27.457 --> 17:29.937
Why are you in a hire car?

17:29.937 --> 17:31.617
Because Porsche have told me

17:31.617 --> 17:35.617
I'm not allowed to drive my brand-new
GT3 and they've taken it off me.

17:35.617 --> 17:39.297
Oh, is this because,
as we mentioned briefly last week,

17:39.297 --> 17:41.417
Porsche GT3s have been
bursting into flames

17:41.417 --> 17:44.097
and now Porsche have told you
you can't drive it any more?

17:44.097 --> 17:46.257
Yes, it is and you both know
full well that it is!

17:46.257 --> 17:48.617
Well, that means you have
no use of those oven gloves,

17:48.617 --> 17:51.137
which I can see down there,
which I bought you last week.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.457
My Porsche driving gloves.

17:52.457 --> 17:56.057
Have they taken it away?
Yes, they've taken it off me!

17:56.057 --> 17:58.257
So, you don't need those,
but it's OK, Hammond,

17:58.257 --> 18:02.097
because I have got you another
present. Oh, good(!) Have you?

18:02.097 --> 18:06.097
No, Hammond, it's a 911 tailored
specifically for you.

18:06.097 --> 18:07.377
Is it(?)

18:07.377 --> 18:09.377
Yes, here it is. Look at that.

18:09.377 --> 18:12.617
Oh, you are literally
the most amusing man

18:12.617 --> 18:15.497
in the whole world. He is.
Even I'm...

18:15.497 --> 18:17.337
Oh, no!

18:17.337 --> 18:19.057
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

18:19.057 --> 18:23.137
Look! It's OK,
I've got on oven gloves.

18:23.137 --> 18:26.377
Put it out as fast as possible!
It's all right.

18:26.377 --> 18:29.657
APPLAUSE

18:29.657 --> 18:32.017
I hate you.
LAUGHTER

18:35.497 --> 18:37.177
Right, now, em...

18:37.177 --> 18:40.177
Yes, as we know, a great many
people in the country

18:40.177 --> 18:42.697
are now starting to use
one of these to move about.

18:42.697 --> 18:44.977
Now, this is called a bicycle

18:44.977 --> 18:49.057
and you can tell just by looking at
it that it is very dangerous

18:49.057 --> 18:51.857
and, as a result,
a lot of people are being hurt

18:51.857 --> 18:53.177
in cycle-related injuries.

18:53.177 --> 18:54.697
In the olden days, the government

18:54.697 --> 18:57.937
would have addressed this problem
by making a public information film.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.257
They used to make them
about all sorts of things.

19:00.257 --> 19:03.577
We had 'Clunk Click Every Trip',
not to go near a railway,

19:03.577 --> 19:05.417
not to play near the water...

19:05.417 --> 19:07.177
Yes, there was 'Don't Run'.

19:07.177 --> 19:10.137
They never told us not to run.
They did! They did not.

19:10.137 --> 19:13.777
I shall show you!
We've got a clip here, look, watch.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.817
FILM VOICEOVER: 'You never know
what's round the corner.

19:16.817 --> 19:18.297
'So don't run.'

19:18.297 --> 19:19.417
GLASS SMASHES

19:19.417 --> 19:22.897
There you go. Yes... That's advice
I have heeded all my life.

19:22.897 --> 19:25.737
You really took that to heart!
You haven't run since, have you?

19:25.737 --> 19:28.697
Of course not! There might be
a pane of glass coming!

19:28.697 --> 19:31.777
Anyway, we don't really get these
public information films any more

19:31.777 --> 19:35.017
because of budget cuts and so on,
so Jeremy and I thought,

19:35.017 --> 19:37.377
to help stop cyclists being injured,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.857
it might be a good idea
to bring them back.

19:39.857 --> 19:44.857
So you two are going to make a public
information film about cycling?!

19:44.857 --> 19:46.177
Yes, we are, actually.

19:46.177 --> 19:49.137
We went to see a panel of experts
at London's Westminster Council

19:49.137 --> 19:51.257
and they said
they would be delighted

19:51.257 --> 19:53.297
if we made a public information film

19:53.297 --> 19:55.817
which would help cut
the number of injuries

19:55.817 --> 19:57.297
and this is what...
CLEARS THROAT

19:57.297 --> 19:59.337
..I came up with. Here we go.

20:18.737 --> 20:23.337
'John works hard, which means that
he can afford to drive a car.

20:28.897 --> 20:33.137
'That means he gets home
to his family safely every night.'

20:33.137 --> 20:35.097
CHILD: Daddy's home!

20:39.377 --> 20:41.457
APPLAUSE

20:43.177 --> 20:44.737
Thank you very much.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.657
I think a work of genius, frankly.

20:49.657 --> 20:53.337
That is terrible. It isn't!
It is! It isn't!

20:53.337 --> 20:57.097
It is. No, it is,
which is why I fired him

20:57.097 --> 21:00.697
and went and had a go at making
a public information film on my own.

21:04.457 --> 21:06.977
'Having come up with
a cracking idea,

21:06.977 --> 21:09.297
'I appointed myself as director,

21:09.297 --> 21:14.017
'gathered together a small cast
and crew, and set to work.'

21:14.017 --> 21:16.377
The whole point of this is...

21:16.377 --> 21:20.097
is to be with you on the swing
and try and look doctor-ish.

21:20.097 --> 21:22.657
That pen isn't very medical,
I'm afraid.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.057
Action.

21:24.057 --> 21:27.497
I love it. Golden! Yeah.

21:27.497 --> 21:29.657
First positions, let's go again.

21:29.657 --> 21:32.937
If you could be opposite each other
on this three-pronged arrangement.

21:32.937 --> 21:35.017
Arms out, singing in the rain.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.377
Good...and action!

21:42.377 --> 21:46.537
Good swinging. Nice.
I'm liking this.

21:48.177 --> 21:52.217
'When my film was finished, Jeremy
and I went to Westminster Council

21:52.217 --> 21:55.177
'to show it to the panel of experts.

21:55.177 --> 22:00.137
'There was Chris Boardman,
policy adviser for British Cycling,

22:00.137 --> 22:03.257
'Martin Low,
City Transport Commissioner

22:03.257 --> 22:07.457
'and Alan Kennedy, Road Safety GB.'

22:07.457 --> 22:11.817
The good news is, we have
two films for you to look at.

22:11.817 --> 22:13.817
No, we have one. No, two.

22:13.817 --> 22:15.177
There's two.

22:15.177 --> 22:17.737
Why don't you show them
yours first of all,

22:17.737 --> 22:20.217
which I believe is that one there?

22:20.217 --> 22:23.297
Gentlemen, if you would like to
relax whilst I just...

22:23.297 --> 22:25.057
insert this in the machine.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.337
CHILDREN'S CHATTERING VOICES

22:36.497 --> 22:38.377
Yee-hee-hee! Woo-hoo!

22:38.377 --> 22:39.937
Waaah!

22:39.937 --> 22:44.697
'You stopped playing with
children's toys when you grew up.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.057
'So why ride a bicycle?'

22:47.057 --> 22:50.017
Oh, I did a skid!

22:58.057 --> 23:00.857
You just haven't got it, have you?
Absolutely crazy.

23:00.857 --> 23:03.217
Well, no,
I can see you are disappointed,

23:03.217 --> 23:04.657
just in the way you're looking.

23:04.657 --> 23:07.017
James, they are disappointed
with your work.

23:07.017 --> 23:09.977
May I just play you this one, if I
may. Just let me show you this one

23:09.977 --> 23:12.857
cos I think this will rectify the
problem, which has begun already.

23:17.177 --> 23:21.617
'John works hard, which means that
he can afford to drive a car.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.297
'Work harder. Get a car.'

23:27.577 --> 23:29.777
Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
Sorry, that's...

23:29.777 --> 23:31.937
You just got it wrong, so wrong.
Dreadfully wrong.

23:31.937 --> 23:35.977
Where's the cyclist? Mangled
at the end. What was the brief?

23:35.977 --> 23:39.137
Well, we are trying to
make cycling safer

23:39.137 --> 23:42.297
and we thought the best way to
do that is to stop people cycling.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.617
But the message you should be
getting across

23:44.617 --> 23:47.777
is that people need to
be considerate towards each other.

23:47.777 --> 23:50.417
I'm not sure they are going
to like our poster idea

23:50.417 --> 23:52.937
that we had as well,
but we came up with that.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.177
We did spell it wrong.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.177
I think we are going in entirely
the wrong direction.

24:03.177 --> 24:06.537
Entirely the wrong direction. Have
you actually spoken to a cyclist?

24:06.537 --> 24:07.857
Well, no.

24:07.857 --> 24:11.417
Well, maybe that would be a good
idea, or even try it yourself.

24:12.977 --> 24:15.177
'And so we put on some
cycling clothes

24:15.177 --> 24:17.137
'and went on a fact-finding trip

24:17.137 --> 24:19.457
'around London's
glittering West End.'

24:21.057 --> 24:23.577
Come on, Jeremy! I'm behind you!

24:23.577 --> 24:26.577
I'll sound my bell for pedestrians.

24:26.577 --> 24:28.497
BELL TINKLES

24:28.497 --> 24:31.417
Look at him, he's wearing
normal clothing, the lunatic!

24:31.417 --> 24:35.577
You'll be killed! You're mad!
You will never make it!

24:37.497 --> 24:40.697
Whoo!
I nearly hit that bloke in the face.

24:40.697 --> 24:44.257
'Our mission was to identify
the dangers that cyclists face

24:44.257 --> 24:48.017
'on the city streets
and soon we spotted one.'

24:48.017 --> 24:49.977
James, we've got to go right. Right?

24:49.977 --> 24:54.297
There's a lot of peril involved
in that. Right... Be careful, James.

24:54.297 --> 24:56.737
There is great peril.

24:56.737 --> 24:59.577
'So, we came up with a solution.'

24:59.577 --> 25:01.257
What if we only went left?

25:01.257 --> 25:03.097
That's not a bad idea, actually.

25:03.097 --> 25:05.417
You can still get
where you want to go by going left.

25:05.417 --> 25:07.017
So we go left here, yes?

25:07.017 --> 25:08.097
Yeah.

25:09.377 --> 25:13.057
There is another little left here
we can do. Excellent.

25:13.057 --> 25:17.337
I feel perfectly safe.
I feel completely safe.

25:17.337 --> 25:20.777
No right turns,
that's the main thing with cycling.

25:20.777 --> 25:24.177
I reckon it improves your chances
of survival by about 85%.

25:24.177 --> 25:25.457
Definitely.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.377
Oh, hang on.
No, I'm not sure that has worked.

25:28.377 --> 25:32.337
I've seen Charles Saatchi having
lunch five times already.

25:34.137 --> 25:35.817
'After an hour in the saddle,

25:35.817 --> 25:38.697
'I discovered
another problem for cyclists.'

25:38.697 --> 25:41.937
Oh, bump, bump!

25:41.937 --> 25:45.137
Really bumpy here and
this is deeply uncomfortable now.

25:46.577 --> 25:48.257
Oh!

25:49.417 --> 25:51.777
Oof! Ow!

25:51.777 --> 25:55.057
I've got to do something
about my bottom, this is really...

25:55.057 --> 25:57.377
uncomfortable.

25:58.817 --> 26:00.577
'So we stopped at a bicycle shop

26:00.577 --> 26:03.377
'where, apparently,
you can buy special creams.'

26:03.377 --> 26:07.257
Are these all to rub onto your bits?
Yes, they are.

26:07.257 --> 26:09.577
Is that normal? Yes,
we even have one for women.

26:09.577 --> 26:12.457
Are women's bottoms different to
men's bottoms? I should think so.

26:12.457 --> 26:13.537
Are they? Yes.

26:13.537 --> 26:15.537
'Having selected the correct cream,

26:15.537 --> 26:18.737
'I went to apply it
in the changing room.'

26:23.977 --> 26:26.217
JEREMY GRUNTS

26:27.457 --> 26:29.137
'This made everything worse.'

26:29.137 --> 26:30.817
Ooh!

26:30.817 --> 26:34.257
Have you ever put toothpaste
on your testicles for a joke?

26:34.257 --> 26:36.337
To be honest, yes, I did,
when I was a teenager.

26:36.337 --> 26:39.137
Yes, exactly, so did I.
Do you remember the pain? Yes, I do.

26:39.137 --> 26:41.457
Well... Is that what it's like?

26:42.697 --> 26:44.777
'James was very sympathetic.'

26:44.777 --> 26:47.537
♪ Goodness gracious
great balls of fire! ♪

26:47.537 --> 26:52.977
'With the pain getting worse...'
Ooh! Ow! Ow!

26:52.977 --> 26:55.537
'..I had to make an emergency stop.'

26:55.537 --> 26:59.657
Please may I use your lavatories?
My scrotum is on fire.

26:59.657 --> 27:01.977
Have you ever put toothpaste
on your scrotum?

27:01.977 --> 27:03.497
Ooh...

27:04.737 --> 27:08.497
'With my gentleman's area sorted,
we got back on the road.'

27:08.497 --> 27:11.297
Right, so the light just went red,

27:11.297 --> 27:13.657
so that means go
when you're on a bicycle.

27:13.657 --> 27:17.377
'And soon we were picking up
valuable information.'

27:17.377 --> 27:21.217
Taxi driver. Very polite. Thank
you very much, sir. Another taxi.

27:21.217 --> 27:23.817
Extremely polite.

27:23.817 --> 27:25.857
Thank you.

27:25.857 --> 27:28.537
Yeah, look at that, you see,
he politely let me go.

27:28.537 --> 27:30.177
Thank you.

27:31.537 --> 27:34.137
I've been riding now for three hours

27:34.137 --> 27:38.137
and not a single car driver
has done anything annoying.

27:38.137 --> 27:41.737
You'd imagine that cycling
around Hyde Park Corner,

27:41.737 --> 27:44.137
which is what I'm doing now,
would be...

27:44.137 --> 27:46.617
as dangerous as juggling chain saws,

27:46.617 --> 27:50.577
but if you keep your eyes open
and you are courteous...

27:50.577 --> 27:52.697
it's fine.

27:54.177 --> 27:57.257
Every car has given me a
six-foot berth, taxis, vans.

27:57.257 --> 27:59.697
Yes, all the cars
and vans have been very decent.

27:59.697 --> 28:01.577
I haven't got a complaint.

28:01.577 --> 28:06.057
'But...there was one type of road
user who wasn't courteous at all.'

28:06.057 --> 28:07.737
Look at this idiot!

28:09.497 --> 28:12.097
BLEEP! BLEEP!

28:12.097 --> 28:14.817
Whoa! God above!

28:14.817 --> 28:16.817
So that bus just overtook me,

28:16.817 --> 28:20.457
so I have to now go on the wrong
side of the road and you get...

28:20.457 --> 28:23.417
And now he's just set off! See?

28:23.417 --> 28:27.137
And I'm stuck
on the wrong side of the road.

28:27.137 --> 28:31.537
These are the problem, I've decided.
The buses.

28:31.537 --> 28:33.337
Because all of the drivers think

28:33.337 --> 28:36.417
they are literally
Lord God Almighty.

28:38.137 --> 28:39.537
BLEEP!

28:39.537 --> 28:43.057
It's bloody murder!
Now they're giving me a wide berth.

28:43.057 --> 28:46.177
Your bus is going to kill me!

28:46.177 --> 28:48.377
You are going to kill me!
Keep going! Keep going!

28:48.377 --> 28:52.497
But he is a homicidal maniac!
And another one!

28:52.497 --> 28:54.897
Aargh!

28:54.897 --> 28:56.217
Aargh!

28:56.217 --> 28:57.737
No, don't do that.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.497
Why do they put bicycles
in the bus lane?!

29:02.097 --> 29:03.577
Whoa!

29:06.977 --> 29:09.417
'And then, just to round
things off...'

29:09.417 --> 29:14.137
Whoa! Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

29:14.137 --> 29:17.377
What are you doing? Look,
the chain has come off.

29:17.377 --> 29:18.697
HORNS BEEP
Sorry.

29:18.697 --> 29:20.177
HORN BEEPS

29:20.177 --> 29:23.377
I know! There's nothing much
I can do, is there? Go over here.

29:23.377 --> 29:27.017
Why can't they build
a machine where the chain stays on?

29:27.017 --> 29:29.297
You've got that derailleur miles
out of adjustment.

29:29.297 --> 29:31.937
I don't know what you're talking
about. What is a de-rail-eum?

29:31.937 --> 29:34.657
It's the thing that moves
the chain across. You've bent it.

29:34.657 --> 29:36.177
So, the gearbox on this is broken?

29:36.177 --> 29:38.537
We are going to have to sell it and
buy another one.

29:38.537 --> 29:43.217
'After James had mended my geranium,
he gave me a stern lecture.'

29:43.217 --> 29:46.737
Bicycles... The reason people
have accidents on bicycles

29:46.737 --> 29:48.817
is cos of things like
the brakes not working,

29:48.817 --> 29:50.257
worn out wheel bearings, bad...

29:50.257 --> 29:53.497
Those out of adjustment, that out of
adjustment, this not tight enough.

29:53.497 --> 29:55.417
It's really easy,
bicycle maintenance,

29:55.417 --> 29:57.777
you only need about three spanners
and a screwdriver.

30:01.177 --> 30:04.297
'With the fact-finding mission over,

30:04.297 --> 30:08.377
'we felt we had become fully paid-up
members of the cycling community.'

30:10.497 --> 30:12.177
Have you got the arts pages?

30:20.937 --> 30:23.377
Mm.

30:23.377 --> 30:27.057
It seems to me,
for our public information film,

30:27.057 --> 30:33.097
what we should do is make cycling
attractive to bus passengers

30:33.097 --> 30:36.017
because then there would be
no need for buses.

30:36.017 --> 30:38.537
And they are the biggest problem
on the road.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.177
Not just for cyclists
but also for cars. Yes.

30:41.177 --> 30:46.577
So if we get rid of buses,
remove the demand for buses...

30:46.577 --> 30:49.657
We get an extra lane.
..everybody wins.

30:49.657 --> 30:55.457
'A few days later, we cycled to the
Top Gear office to discuss

30:55.457 --> 30:58.177
'some new ideas for our important
public information film.'

30:59.977 --> 31:05.097
I think what that does is it
dissuades people from using the bus.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.697
Yes, but it isn't true.
It is. It isn't.

31:08.697 --> 31:11.057
It is, I went on a bus once
and I got an eye infection.

31:11.057 --> 31:14.377
Some people get diphtheria
or rickets or scurvy.

31:14.377 --> 31:17.377
They do. It is nonsense, it is
not going to work.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.257
'I then showed Jeremy something
I'd put together.'

31:20.257 --> 31:22.497
ON TV: 'Hello, cyclists,

31:22.497 --> 31:25.817
'I am here today to talk to you
about bicycle maintenance.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.817
'Let's start with the most
important part of a bike.

31:28.817 --> 31:30.937
'You simply rotate this adjuster

31:30.937 --> 31:33.737
'until the brake blocks are almost
in contact with the wheel.

31:33.737 --> 31:36.577
'Lock it with the nut and then...'

31:39.217 --> 31:42.737
'..the chain and the sprockets
will grind together.

31:42.737 --> 31:46.297
'Make sure there is no
play in the steering head bearings.

31:46.297 --> 31:48.937
'If there is, if you can feel
a little clunk, clunk, clunk...'

31:48.937 --> 31:54.337
How much more is there of this?
Well, quite a lot. How long is this?

31:54.337 --> 31:57.857
58 minutes.
What, a 58 minute thing?!

31:57.857 --> 32:01.497
It is more a public information
documentary, if I am honest.

32:03.257 --> 32:08.217
'Annoyingly, James's other ideas
were even worse.'

32:08.217 --> 32:09.857
Action!

32:14.017 --> 32:18.257
Why is he dressed up as Hitler?
Because cyclists need to be visible.

32:19.457 --> 32:21.697
Christ on a bike!

32:24.537 --> 32:28.817
James, you can't do that.
Yes, I can.

32:28.817 --> 32:30.697
'As he brought out a cross,

32:30.697 --> 32:33.577
'I left him alone
and went off to work on my own.'

32:33.577 --> 32:37.097
One of the problems I discovered
on my fact-finding bike ride

32:37.097 --> 32:42.217
around London is that pedestrians
simply don't hear bicycles coming.

32:42.217 --> 32:43.577
They step off the kerb,

32:43.577 --> 32:46.937
the cyclist has to swerve
into the path of a bus.

32:46.937 --> 32:51.977
Blood, artery gush, burst,
court case, murder, disaster.

32:51.977 --> 32:54.297
Bicycles, therefore,
need to be louder.

32:59.257 --> 33:01.057
ENGINE ROARS

33:03.177 --> 33:08.217
What I have done is attached to the
back of this bike a jet engine.

33:10.857 --> 33:14.417
And now pedestrians can
definitely hear me coming.

33:14.417 --> 33:16.737
And so can other motorists.

33:16.737 --> 33:20.137
And people in subterranean caves
in other countries.

33:21.977 --> 33:26.257
Even the profoundly deaf would know
I was on my way,

33:26.257 --> 33:28.897
they would feel a disturbance
in the force.

33:32.617 --> 33:34.937
Of course,
another advantage is, you don't

33:34.937 --> 33:37.417
have to do any of that
annoying pedalling.

33:37.417 --> 33:43.577
Again my genius is staggering me,
it really is.

33:43.577 --> 33:45.857
Oh, dear, I am out of fuel.

33:47.577 --> 33:50.217
I have run out of fuel.

33:50.217 --> 33:51.737
That is what's happened now.

33:52.857 --> 33:54.297
Damn.

33:57.217 --> 34:00.577
Think of it, really, as a hybrid.

34:00.577 --> 34:01.897
There we go.

34:03.137 --> 34:07.497
'For the rest of the day,
we tried all sorts of other ideas.'

34:07.497 --> 34:08.536
Here we go.

34:10.857 --> 34:13.257
Ooh!

34:17.617 --> 34:21.217
What's it supposed to be?
It's a cyclist after an accident.

34:22.337 --> 34:24.817
I couldn't use an actual cyclist,
could I?

34:24.817 --> 34:29.137
So for example, the double
mini-roundabout, OK?

34:29.137 --> 34:33.016
So you come round here, then it is
your right of way going up here.

34:33.016 --> 34:34.976
But... Action!

34:37.137 --> 34:38.617
HE SCREAMS

34:40.417 --> 34:43.737
'After a great deal of extremely
hard work, we ended up with

34:43.737 --> 34:46.697
'a couple of films that we could
take to our panel of experts.'

34:46.697 --> 34:49.177
Before we show them to you,
let me say,

34:49.177 --> 34:52.496
do you remember the early public
information films from our youth?

34:52.496 --> 34:56.137
I do. They always picked on some
very specific detail.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.697
Don't put a rug on a polished
floor or don't fish under

34:58.697 --> 35:01.257
power lines. They were very tight.

35:01.257 --> 35:04.897
And so, we have tried to
focus on very specific details

35:04.897 --> 35:11.097
of cycling that we experience.
We hope that erm...

35:11.097 --> 35:13.977
This one first?
Yes, I think that's... OK.

35:18.497 --> 35:22.777
'Cut the green wire. For God's sake,
do not cut the red wire.

35:22.777 --> 35:26.217
'It is imperative
to cut the green wire.'

35:42.497 --> 35:45.297
Well, I mean... I'm not sure we're
getting anywhere here...

35:45.297 --> 35:47.097
What are you trying to
achieve with that?

35:47.097 --> 35:49.417
Cyclists jump red lights,
we know this.

35:49.417 --> 35:50.937
Everybody has seen that happen.

35:50.937 --> 35:53.657
It is what annoys people
most about bicycles.

35:53.657 --> 35:56.337
This is making the roads a happier
place because cyclists

35:56.337 --> 35:59.337
wait like they are supposed to,
car drivers aren't infuriated.

35:59.337 --> 36:02.777
And cyclists don't get
knocked off or indeed blown up.

36:02.777 --> 36:05.457
You didn't listen to what we said,
did you?

36:05.457 --> 36:08.217
You said we had to make the roads
a more harmonious place.

36:08.217 --> 36:10.897
Exploding cyclists doesn't really
get that message across.

36:10.897 --> 36:14.577
You're really trying to waste our
time today because that is way off.

36:14.577 --> 36:17.737
What, you want them
to jump red lights? No, we don't.

36:17.737 --> 36:20.537
I'm talking about that commercial,
it is absolutely wrong.

36:20.537 --> 36:24.977
Well, let's try... Yes. Yes, please.

36:24.977 --> 36:28.177
This may be more to your taste then,
I think.

36:28.177 --> 36:32.817
'I have a dream.

37:14.817 --> 37:17.937

it was back to the studio.'

37:17.937 --> 37:21.417
APPLAUSE

37:23.817 --> 37:31.257
So... There is no way... Come on. No.
So, you two completely cocked it up.

37:31.257 --> 37:34.937
I don't know what was wrong
with my jet bike.

37:34.937 --> 37:37.697
Well, it was a motor on a bicycle

37:37.697 --> 37:41.017
and therefore it was a "motor"
cycle.

37:41.017 --> 37:44.657
It wasn't a motorcycle,
it was superb. How fast did it go?

37:44.657 --> 37:47.697
At one point I was clocked at 73mph.

37:47.697 --> 37:50.697
Yes, that does sound like the top
speed of a motorbike.

37:50.697 --> 37:53.097
He is right, you know. Thank you.
He isn't right.

37:53.097 --> 37:57.217
And anyway, listen, eventually
we did come up with a film which

37:57.217 --> 37:59.937
we think will keep that
panel of experts happy.

38:01.337 --> 38:04.897
Because, in essence,
it makes everybody happy

38:04.897 --> 38:07.537
and gooey with everybody else.

38:07.537 --> 38:08.897
Here we go, let's have a watch.

APPLAUSE

38:55.057 --> 39:00.097
No, an inch? They need 6ft.

39:00.097 --> 39:02.897
No, Hammond, it is
a figure of speech, you idiot.

39:02.897 --> 39:06.737
I couldn't say, you know, give them
1.85m, that is ridiculous.

39:06.737 --> 39:09.817
The fact is, we have solved cycling.

39:09.817 --> 39:12.737
If people weren't watching
Call The Midwife on the other side

39:12.737 --> 39:15.337
tonight, there would be no more
cycling-related accidents.

39:15.337 --> 39:17.057
So, you're saying,

39:17.057 --> 39:21.657
watching Call The Midwife is now
socially irresponsible? Yes. It is.

39:21.657 --> 39:23.777
And it is morally wrong. Exactly.

39:24.937 --> 39:28.697
Anyway, it is time to put a Star
in our Reasonably Priced Car.

39:28.697 --> 39:31.577
And we are going to do
something incredible.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.937
For the next few minutes,

39:32.937 --> 39:36.457
we are going to stop your teenage
daughter from texting.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.177
And that's
because my guest tonight played

39:39.177 --> 39:41.017
Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad.

39:41.017 --> 39:43.257
CHEERING AND SQUEALING

39:43.257 --> 39:46.257
Stopped already!
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Paul!

39:46.257 --> 39:49.097
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:50.257 --> 39:52.337
He's here.

39:52.337 --> 39:55.977
How are you? What's up, buddy?
How are you? I'm good, I'm good.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.577
Hi.

40:00.097 --> 40:04.697
I love them. Yes,
this is a big noise. Have a seat.

40:04.697 --> 40:07.417
All right. Have a seat.

40:07.417 --> 40:10.937
It is strange to
have on a guest from a show that was

40:10.937 --> 40:13.297
never on British TV... Yeah.

40:13.297 --> 40:16.577
..who is now in a film that
isn't even out yet. Yeah.

40:16.577 --> 40:19.897
Everyone is screaming and yelling.
I love you all.

40:19.897 --> 40:22.537
AUDIENCE: We love you!

40:22.537 --> 40:26.937
Let's do the film, if we may. It is
Need For Speed. Need For Speed.

40:26.937 --> 40:30.857
It is the story of Tobey Marshall,
the guy I play.

40:30.857 --> 40:34.657
He spends a couple of years in prison
for something that he did not do,

40:34.657 --> 40:38.177
so the moment he gets
out of prison it's just...

40:38.177 --> 40:41.097
He is trying to right a wrong,
vengeance is on his mind.

40:41.097 --> 40:44.257
He has to try and get
from the East Coast to the West Coast

40:44.257 --> 40:47.537
in less than 48 hours
in a car, a very fast car.

40:47.537 --> 40:50.377
What sort of car? It is
a Shelby Mustang.

40:50.377 --> 40:53.657
Shelby Mustang? Yeah. Well, it can
be quite fast, nice straight line.

40:53.657 --> 40:55.937
You should be able to do that.

40:55.937 --> 40:59.057
So it sounds like it has got
Top Gear written all over it.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.457
Yeah, he wanted to do a throwback,
our director,

41:01.457 --> 41:05.297
to films that really
started this genre.

41:05.297 --> 41:08.977
Like Bullitt and Vanishing Point
and Smokey And The Bandit.

41:08.977 --> 41:13.257
Back then they couldn't rely on CG,
they couldn't rely on green screen

41:13.257 --> 41:17.257
so everything you see in this
movie actually happened.

41:17.257 --> 41:20.697
There is no CGI? No CG whatsoever.
Seriously? Yeah.

41:20.697 --> 41:22.097
Let's have a look at a clip

41:22.097 --> 41:25.097
and you will see why I am looking
incredulous. Here we go.

41:26.377 --> 41:28.817
'They took everything from me.

41:38.737 --> 41:40.457
'All those who defied me...

41:41.457 --> 41:46.017
'..shall be ashamed and disgraced.

41:47.657 --> 41:52.617
'Those who wage war against me...
shall perish.

41:55.337 --> 41:57.577
'I will find strength...

41:59.017 --> 42:04.137
'..find guidance.
And I...will...triumph.'

42:15.617 --> 42:17.817
APPLAUSE

42:17.817 --> 42:22.497
That was all for real? Yeah, it's...
It gets pretty violent.

42:22.497 --> 42:24.977
So it really did do a roll?

42:24.977 --> 42:26.377
They actually did those, yes.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.537
I presume these are body shells,
they are not actual... No, no, no.

42:29.537 --> 42:32.577
..million dollar cars?

42:32.577 --> 42:36.377
We consider those cars
a piece of art.

42:36.377 --> 42:40.057
But the kit cars they built
were about 300,000 a piece

42:40.057 --> 42:41.577
and they just destroyed them.

42:41.577 --> 42:43.977
That is unbelievable but forgive me,

42:43.977 --> 42:45.857
I have got to get on to
Breaking Bad.

42:45.857 --> 42:47.257
Yes.

42:47.257 --> 42:49.857
CHEERING
Thank you.

42:49.857 --> 42:52.697
There's quite a few puzzled faces
going, "What is Breaking Bad?"

42:52.697 --> 42:56.137
"What is Breaking Bad?"
This is Jesse Pinkman.

42:56.137 --> 42:57.577
As far as I am concerned,

42:57.577 --> 43:00.737
I am now talking to the world's
greatest crystal meth salesman.

43:00.737 --> 43:02.817
Yes.
LAUGHTER

43:02.817 --> 43:03.977
For those who don't know,

43:03.977 --> 43:06.377
it was about a chemistry teacher who
meets a delinquent,

43:06.377 --> 43:09.857
an ex-pupil. He's got this guy,
he has been diagnosed with cancer

43:09.857 --> 43:13.017
and he thinks, "To pay for my
treatment I will start making

43:13.017 --> 43:15.417
"crystal meth
cos I am a chemistry teacher."

43:15.417 --> 43:17.177
And the series runs from there.

43:17.177 --> 43:21.537
We don't really have crystal
meth in this country. That's great.

43:21.537 --> 43:25.177
What is crystal meth, do you know
what it is? No, not really.

43:25.177 --> 43:27.617
I have been making
it for the past six years

43:27.617 --> 43:30.777
and I have no idea what it is. No,
it is just a terrible, awful drug.

43:30.777 --> 43:34.377
It just grabs a hold of some
people and just doesn't let go.

43:34.377 --> 43:37.297
Do you know what I loved about the
show? It is the detailing in it.

43:37.297 --> 43:42.457
And the cars you all drove. Yes,
they are incredible. Who chose those?

43:42.457 --> 43:44.497
It was all Vince Gilligan.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.017
He is the creator of the show,

43:46.017 --> 43:48.777
his attention to detail is
just incredible.

43:48.777 --> 43:55.057
There is this famous conversation he
had for two hours about the certain

43:55.057 --> 43:58.897
colour of red nail polish that was
going to go on Skyler's toenails.

43:58.897 --> 44:01.857
He was going to get the cars right
because Walter,

44:01.857 --> 44:05.377
who is the chemistry teacher,
has a Pontiac Aztek. Yes.

44:05.377 --> 44:08.417
Never been sold here
but it was probably the worst car.

44:09.497 --> 44:14.497
It is just such a sad car. Look at
it. Look at that, it is just so sad.

44:14.497 --> 44:18.097
It is a sign that your life has gone
terribly, terribly wrong.

44:19.697 --> 44:21.457
It was interesting with you

44:21.457 --> 44:24.937
because you started out with
a Chevy Monte Carlo, wasn't it? Yes.

44:24.937 --> 44:26.177
When you were a delinquent.

44:26.177 --> 44:28.297
But when you became more
and more successful,

44:28.297 --> 44:29.817
switched to the Toyota Tercel.

44:29.817 --> 44:31.017
Look at that.

44:31.017 --> 44:33.617
I actually wanted that car so bad
when we wrapped.

44:33.617 --> 44:39.137
Were you able to keep it? No, they
didn't allow me to take it. Why not?

44:39.137 --> 44:40.577
It is worth 32.

44:41.897 --> 44:44.897
That is shocking, but it is that
attention to detail which

44:44.897 --> 44:48.017
I absolutely adored, I really did.

44:48.017 --> 44:51.577
Now, more questions about Breaking
Bad, which fascinates me.

44:51.577 --> 44:56.897
About American television. We know
that US networks, they are brutal.

44:56.897 --> 44:58.537
One minute...

44:58.537 --> 45:01.537
LAUGHTER

45:01.537 --> 45:06.017
You've got a chat show... Um...
LAUGHTER

45:07.417 --> 45:11.297
Who are you talking about? Did you
know Piers Morgan? Oh, yeah! Yeah.

45:11.297 --> 45:13.337
I had a feeling you were
talking about him.

45:13.337 --> 45:16.137
Where I was going, really -
you have got these US networks,

45:16.137 --> 45:20.057
presumably Breaking Bad was only
ever going to be one series.

45:20.057 --> 45:23.137
They would have only commissioned
one, to see how it works? Yeah.

45:23.137 --> 45:28.897
Every network passed on Breaking Bad
initially. HBO Showtime, everyone.

45:28.897 --> 45:32.497
And then AMC decided to give it
a shot. With one series?

45:32.497 --> 45:37.337
With one pilot. And then they had to
see how that was, how it turned out.

45:37.337 --> 45:42.017
I mean, we were lucky we even stayed
on the air because our ratings

45:42.017 --> 45:45.177
weren't that great.
But the critics loved us. So...

45:45.177 --> 45:47.457
No, it was very clever.
Absolutely brilliant.

45:47.457 --> 45:51.297
Thank you. Now, your cars in real
life - not a Toyota Tercel?

45:51.297 --> 45:53.057
You started out with a Toyota,
I believe?

45:53.057 --> 45:58.737
I did, I started out with an '82
Toyota Corolla. Mm-mm(!) Yeah.

45:58.737 --> 46:01.657
It was beautiful. Was it(?)
Faded gold.

46:01.657 --> 46:03.737
Any time it rained,

46:03.737 --> 46:06.057
the trunk would fill up with water,
stick shift.

46:06.057 --> 46:07.657
But I loved that car. Stick shift

46:07.657 --> 46:12.377
And I bought a Toyota Forerunner.
It's getting worse.

46:13.817 --> 46:17.777
And then I bought an old classic
car. OK, which is?

46:17.777 --> 46:20.817
A '65 Shelby Cobra.

46:20.817 --> 46:22.097
Really? Oh!

46:24.497 --> 46:27.697
We could have... You know,
you see... The Shelby Cobra...

46:27.697 --> 46:32.417
Oh, there it is. That is actually...
that is you in it! That is my car.

46:32.417 --> 46:36.137
I only take it... It is my weekend
car, I take it along the coast.

46:36.137 --> 46:40.217
But if you are driving in a parking
lot, it sets off the alarms.

46:40.217 --> 46:42.457
I love doing that. It's great.
It's fantastic.

46:42.457 --> 46:44.337
They are absolutely fabulous.

46:44.337 --> 46:46.297
My daughter is going to be
mental now,

46:46.297 --> 46:49.457
because that is her favourite car
and her favourite actor driving it.

46:49.457 --> 46:51.337
I love your daughter. Yeah.

46:51.337 --> 46:53.217
No, you don't. Um...

46:53.217 --> 46:56.337
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

46:56.337 --> 46:59.817
Right, now.
Obviously you came down here...

46:59.817 --> 47:01.297
This is ballsy, I've got to say,

47:01.297 --> 47:06.577
because you have come down here to
do your lap, which is quite brave.

47:06.577 --> 47:09.977
Yeah. Let's see how I did.
I mean, I don't know. It was fun.

47:09.977 --> 47:12.177
Shall we have a look at the lap?
Oh, God!

47:12.177 --> 47:14.737
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
Here we go.

47:14.737 --> 47:15.777
ENGINE SCREAMS

47:15.777 --> 47:16.977
TYRES SCREECH

47:16.977 --> 47:19.737
Wow, that is a brutal start.

47:19.737 --> 47:21.857
All right,
I just don't want to get last.

47:22.857 --> 47:27.937
Setting high goals for myself.
Not to get last.

47:27.937 --> 47:30.817
No, it's OK, because for the first
time ever this year,

47:30.817 --> 47:33.377
the weather is good.

47:33.377 --> 47:34.857
TYRES SCREECH

47:34.857 --> 47:38.457
That thing does grip well. Here
we go. Yeah.

47:38.457 --> 47:41.337
It's OK, it's OK. Yeah.

47:42.457 --> 47:46.017
Come on. Tongue out.

47:47.257 --> 47:50.977
Oh, that is a very good line
around there. Thank you.

47:50.977 --> 47:56.057
Very nice. The dreaded Hammerhead,
I hate this turn.

47:56.057 --> 47:58.297
OK, OK...

47:59.377 --> 48:02.897
That is heavy braking you are giving
it there! Yeah. Well, you know.

48:02.897 --> 48:06.017
Oh, that is very,
very neat and tidy.

48:07.377 --> 48:08.857
Come on, you...

48:11.217 --> 48:12.377
..bitch!

48:12.377 --> 48:14.817
LAUGHTER
We knew it!

48:14.817 --> 48:18.337
No way were you going to get round
the lap without saying THAT!

48:21.777 --> 48:26.297
Ooh, the comfortable line,
missing the apex.

48:26.297 --> 48:28.497
Second-to-last corner,
this catches...

48:28.497 --> 48:31.177
Well, that was absolutely bob on.

48:31.177 --> 48:35.297
Now, Gambon, again kissing
everything perfectly

48:35.297 --> 48:36.737
and you cross the line!

48:36.737 --> 48:38.817
CHEERING

48:38.817 --> 48:43.417
Ah-h-h... Well, now.

48:45.217 --> 48:46.337
These are the wet times.

48:46.337 --> 48:49.017
You will not be last,
because Jack Whitehall, bless him,

48:49.017 --> 48:52.377
he had never driven before.
So you will not be lower than him.

48:52.377 --> 48:56.377
OK, good. So, where do you think you
came? I have no idea.

48:56.377 --> 49:01.737
I want to be above James Blunt.
James Blunt was 1.49.4.

49:01.737 --> 49:04.857
That is FW,
which stands for flipping wet.

49:04.857 --> 49:06.817
So you are definitely going to the
above him.

49:06.817 --> 49:08.017
So come on, be reasonable.

49:08.017 --> 49:10.857
I mean, I would like to be
towards the top, but...

49:10.857 --> 49:14.097
That is the 1.45 region. Yeah.
I mean, I don't know...

49:14.097 --> 49:15.617
Do you know, I was just about to
say,

49:15.617 --> 49:17.497
"Well, Jesse Pinkman..."
But I won't.

49:18.857 --> 49:21.017
Aaron Paul. Yes. 1...

49:21.017 --> 49:22.537
forty...

49:27.977 --> 49:29.657
..4...
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

49:29.657 --> 49:31.297
Oh! ..7.

49:32.297 --> 49:34.177
That is the best we've ever had!

49:34.177 --> 49:36.977
CHEERING
Number one.

49:36.977 --> 49:39.577
Come here. Yes! Wow!

49:39.577 --> 49:43.417
That's good. Good man. Yes!

49:43.417 --> 49:46.737
The fastest man ever to take
the Astra around the track.

49:46.737 --> 49:50.297
That's amazing.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Paul!

49:50.297 --> 49:52.017
CHEERING

49:54.817 --> 49:59.057
Now, that is going to take some
beating!

49:59.057 --> 50:03.857
This is the ã650,000 Porsche 918.

50:03.857 --> 50:05.577
It is insanely fast.

50:05.577 --> 50:10.697
It's rammed full of technology
and most importantly, it is a hybrid.

50:10.697 --> 50:14.377
In many ways, then, exactly the same
as the McLaren P1 that Jeremy

50:14.377 --> 50:17.057
fell in love with a few weeks back.

50:17.057 --> 50:20.257
The big question, though...
Is it any good?

50:20.257 --> 50:22.817
No!
LAUGHTER

50:28.657 --> 50:34.137
When Jeremy tested the P1, he took
it to the Spa racetrack in Belgium.

50:34.137 --> 50:37.857
My F1 track may not have that
pedigree,

50:37.857 --> 50:42.777
but at this place, at least the fun
doesn't stop when the sun goes down.

51:15.097 --> 51:19.697
The Abu Dhabi circuit is also
famed for having a 1.2km straight,

51:19.697 --> 51:22.097
one of the longest anywhere.

51:22.097 --> 51:25.257
Seems like a good place to start.

51:25.257 --> 51:27.097
Let's make some noise.

51:27.097 --> 51:29.017
ENGINE ROARS
TYRES SCREECH

51:30.017 --> 51:31.537
Oh, that is breathtaking!

51:39.777 --> 51:41.097
Oh, ha-ha-ha!

51:43.417 --> 51:45.097
9,000rpm.

51:45.097 --> 51:46.697
Boom!

51:49.417 --> 51:51.537
Yee-nar!

51:51.537 --> 51:53.297
Big speed!

51:53.297 --> 51:54.817
280.

51:57.297 --> 51:58.537
Braking...

52:00.257 --> 52:04.017
Oh, that is... That is
acceleration unlike anything else.

52:04.017 --> 52:07.857
I know Jeremy's head was blown off
by the speed of that P1,

52:07.857 --> 52:13.577
but I absolutely cannot believe
that it felt any faster than this.

52:13.577 --> 52:14.937
It can't have done.

52:19.257 --> 52:23.977
'Like the McLaren, the 918 has a
joint strike force of petrol engine

52:23.977 --> 52:26.737
'and electric motors
working together.'

52:28.857 --> 52:33.937
It's that electric power that gives
it so much punch off the line.

52:35.297 --> 52:40.417
I have 500 foot-pound
of torque at 800rpm. 800!

52:40.417 --> 52:43.977
The 458 doesn't
have 500 torques at any rpm.

52:45.297 --> 52:47.657
It just wakes up, it's like a
sprinter falling out of bed

52:47.657 --> 52:49.977
and going straight into
a world record

52:49.977 --> 52:52.217
while the others
are eating cornflakes

52:52.217 --> 52:54.057
and thinking about having a poo.

52:54.057 --> 52:57.577
'The petrol engine,
which sounds ungodly through those

52:57.577 --> 53:00.377
'top-mounted exhausts,

53:00.377 --> 53:05.257
'is a 612 horsepower 4.6 litre V8.'

53:10.097 --> 53:13.177
On the topic of power
and performance,

53:13.177 --> 53:17.017
the 918 and the P1
can trade punches all day long.

53:20.977 --> 53:26.657
The 918 can't match the P1's top
speed, 218 compared to 211.

53:29.457 --> 53:36.057
'But I get to 60 quicker.
2.6 seconds to his sluggish 2.8.'

53:36.057 --> 53:42.097
I've got 875 brake horsepower and the
P1 has 903, but I've got more torque.

53:46.097 --> 53:49.937
And on and on and on it goes.
It's King Kong versus Godzilla.

54:00.937 --> 54:03.697
'There are some areas, though,

54:03.697 --> 54:08.097
'where the 918 definitely has
the P1 on the ropes.

54:08.097 --> 54:11.057
'It can retrieve energy
generated by braking

54:11.057 --> 54:14.017
'and feed it back into the batteries.

54:14.017 --> 54:18.817
'The roof lifts out so you can enjoy
some open-top cruising.

54:18.817 --> 54:22.817
'And inside, you get some actual
creature comforts,

54:22.817 --> 54:27.137
'like electric seats
and an 11-speaker sound system.

54:27.137 --> 54:30.497
'You don't get either of those
on a P1.'

54:30.497 --> 54:34.537
I am not one to gloat,
but hello, glove box, yeah?

54:34.537 --> 54:38.177
And then this centre console, from
where I can control the top screen.

54:38.177 --> 54:40.857
That does many things up there.

54:40.857 --> 54:43.577
And then over 800 functions can be
controlled

54:43.577 --> 54:46.297
from the touch-sensitive screen
down here.

54:46.297 --> 54:47.617
Maybe I can go online

54:47.617 --> 54:51.737
and order Jeremy a set of spanners to
adjust the seat on his P1.

54:51.737 --> 54:53.737
Look up "old-fashioned" for me.

54:57.577 --> 55:00.737
'In addition to the
wealth of on-board amusements,

55:00.737 --> 55:04.497
'the 918 also has many driving
modes.'

55:05.497 --> 55:08.097
Right now,
I am in fully electric mode.

55:10.497 --> 55:13.257
And I can whisper
around like this for 18 miles,

55:13.257 --> 55:16.697
compared to the P1's seven.

55:16.697 --> 55:19.617
But if I go down here,
I can select hybrid.

55:20.937 --> 55:23.537
And that allows it to
alternate between petrol

55:23.537 --> 55:26.217
and electric in the most
efficient way.

55:26.217 --> 55:31.977
Or we've got sport mode, where
we have petrol power all the time.

55:31.977 --> 55:35.977
But, I'm here on this racetrack,
so let's go one further.

55:35.977 --> 55:37.417
Put it in race mode.

55:42.177 --> 55:44.697
'Now the petrol engine is top dog.

55:44.697 --> 55:47.377
'The electric motors
are acting as its wingmen.'

55:48.817 --> 55:50.937
It's time to attack some corners.

55:57.537 --> 55:58.617
Hell's bells!

56:02.297 --> 56:03.577
That grip!

56:09.217 --> 56:13.137
God, this thing corners -
and I mean it - flat!

56:13.137 --> 56:14.377
Totally flat.

56:19.097 --> 56:21.937
And there is none of that
bottom-clenching terror Jeremy

56:21.937 --> 56:23.497
talked about in the P1.

56:28.617 --> 56:32.057
'Partly, that is because where the P1
is rear drive only,

56:32.057 --> 56:37.497
'the 918 has four-wheel-drive
and four-wheel steering.'

56:40.817 --> 56:42.217
I think in essence yes,

56:42.217 --> 56:46.457
the P1 is more a proper fighter
pilot, seat-of-the-pants staff.

56:46.457 --> 56:48.977
This is altogether more civilised.

56:48.977 --> 56:52.337
But that does not mean it's boring,
because it just isn't.

56:56.177 --> 57:01.257
The back end crates away
like a rear-wheel-drive car.

57:01.257 --> 57:02.697
Ha-ha-ha!

57:05.457 --> 57:06.977
What a thing!

57:14.497 --> 57:19.097
'But even though the 918 is more
grown-up than the P1,

57:19.097 --> 57:22.657
'it can still boast some pretty
exciting achievements.'

57:24.657 --> 57:25.937
The fact is,

57:25.937 --> 57:30.497
this car has lapped the Nurburgring
in 6 minutes 57 seconds.

57:30.497 --> 57:33.977
That is faster than any other
road-legal production car.

57:33.977 --> 57:35.417
To put it into context,

57:35.417 --> 57:40.417
a hard-core Lexus LFA did it
in 7 minutes 14 seconds.

57:40.417 --> 57:44.777
The mighty Nissan GTR was almost
half a minute slower.

57:44.777 --> 57:48.497
As for the P1, McLaren are saying
it has gone round in under

57:48.497 --> 57:52.457
seven minutes, but they're not
saying an actual time.

57:53.977 --> 57:57.417
I don't know, maybe they lost
the piece of paper it was written on.

57:57.417 --> 57:58.457
Or something.

58:15.737 --> 58:19.177
'With daylight coming, I locked up,

58:19.177 --> 58:21.737
'left the keys to the circuit
under the mat

58:21.737 --> 58:23.737
'and went in search of breakfast.

58:26.257 --> 58:30.937
'Full of awe for this
incredible machine.'

58:30.937 --> 58:36.257
Here I am with 875bhp,
a 4.6 litre V8 that sounds...

58:36.257 --> 58:37.377
ENGINE ROARS

58:37.377 --> 58:38.697
..like that.

58:38.697 --> 58:42.977
And yet the CO2 emissions
are lower than a Toyota Prius.

58:42.977 --> 58:46.017
And certainly, much lower than a P1.

58:46.017 --> 58:50.737
I don't know, this is just all round
a more impressive achievement.

58:50.737 --> 58:52.817
It is more of its time.

58:52.817 --> 58:54.297
To put it another way,

58:54.297 --> 58:59.697
McLaren have used hybrid technology
to liven up a supercar today.

58:59.697 --> 59:04.817
Porsche have used hybrid technology
to save the supercar for tomorrow.

59:06.697 --> 59:08.177
This is an important car.

59:13.737 --> 59:16.417
CHEERING

59:16.417 --> 59:17.617
Oh, yeah.

59:17.617 --> 59:21.937
There it is. I'm amazed it didn't
catch fire. Shut up.

59:21.937 --> 59:24.297
Never mind that.
Now, listen, Hammond.

59:24.297 --> 59:28.817
In that film, you said there is
none of the bottom-clenching terror

59:28.817 --> 59:32.097
when you drive this that you get
in a McLaren P1. How do you know?

59:32.097 --> 59:34.657
You haven't driven a McLaren P1.

59:34.657 --> 59:37.497
I know that because after you had
driven the McLaren P1,

59:37.497 --> 59:40.217
you said it was a day of
bottom-clenching terror.

59:40.217 --> 59:41.857
I did, a bit.

59:41.857 --> 59:45.297
But I was driving
in the pouring rain at Spa.

59:45.297 --> 59:47.777
You were in Abu Dhabi, bone dry,

59:47.777 --> 59:50.697
and with eight mile run-offs
on all the corners.

59:50.697 --> 59:54.137
The fact is, the 918 can handle its
power better.

59:54.137 --> 59:55.737
Its dribble of power.

59:55.737 --> 59:58.137
It has barely got enough to get
out of its own way.

59:58.137 --> 01:00:01.417
And how do you know that? Because you
haven't driven the Porsche.

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:03.217
Because Porsche won't let me.

01:00:03.217 --> 01:00:06.537
Yes, because they know, Jennifer,
you can't drive in a straight line.

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:09.057
We've seen it. At least
I didn't write a book about it.

01:00:09.057 --> 01:00:12.097
And try to milk the moment.
Enough, enough, enough.

01:00:12.097 --> 01:00:14.737
Let me interrupt with the solution
to all this.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:17.057
Because later on in the year,
hopefully, we are

01:00:17.057 --> 01:00:19.297
going to make a special
Top Gear programme.

01:00:19.297 --> 01:00:23.017
One in which Richard and Jennifer
bring the Porsche 918

01:00:23.017 --> 01:00:25.657
and the McLaren P1 down to our track

01:00:25.657 --> 01:00:28.457
and we will see
which is the fastest.

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:30.057
Should be quite good, actually.

01:00:30.057 --> 01:00:31.897
Hopefully, we will be able to put
together

01:00:31.897 --> 01:00:33.457
June, July sometime, around then.

01:00:33.457 --> 01:00:35.497
And it'll basically be
England versus Germany.

01:00:35.497 --> 01:00:39.937
But before then, in fact,
starting next weekend,

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:44.977
we have our all-new, two-part,
Top Gear Christmas special.

01:00:44.977 --> 01:00:47.657
Yet, it is a bit late, we're sorry.
A bit late, yes.

01:00:47.657 --> 01:00:50.097
It's an Easter special. Whatever.

01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:54.977
The three of us are told to build
a bridge over the River Kwai.

01:00:56.017 --> 01:00:58.897
But first, we have to get there.

01:00:58.897 --> 01:01:04.377
And that means driving all the way
across Burma in lorries that we

01:01:04.377 --> 01:01:08.617
bought from the Internet
unseen for a few hundred quid.

01:01:10.217 --> 01:01:11.617
And on that BURMA-shell...

01:01:11.617 --> 01:01:13.537
There it is. ..it's time to end.

01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:16.057
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night.

01:01:16.057 --> 01:01:18.777
