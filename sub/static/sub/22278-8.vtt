00:06.133 --> 00:08.300
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.333 --> 00:11.233
Alaskans battle
winter's icy grip.

00:11.267 --> 00:13.033
Water!

00:13.067 --> 00:16.267
Sue braves the open tundra
to expand her arsenal.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.333
I'm not used to driving.

00:18.367 --> 00:20.767
Glenn digs deep for survival.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.100
GLENN:
I can feel it in my feet.
It vibrates.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.533
Chip scrambles
to beat the freeze.

00:26.567 --> 00:28.233
CHIP: This is
subsistence heating.

00:28.267 --> 00:31.600
NARRATOR: And a novice fights
for a foothold in the wild.

00:31.633 --> 00:34.000
ANDY: Snowshoes aren't exactly
modern technology.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.767
SUE: I have a little journey
I'm gonna go on.

00:54.833 --> 00:58.600
So, I want my bullets,
my tiny medical kit.

00:58.633 --> 01:00.733
My mobility and ability

01:00.767 --> 01:03.767
to get to other locations,

01:03.800 --> 01:06.933
I'd like to widen my sphere
with that.

01:06.967 --> 01:11.433
And so, I ordered up and
had specifically made
an Argo.

01:11.467 --> 01:13.833
It's an eight-wheeled
all-terrain vehicle
with tracks.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.967
So that I can have
a mode of transportation.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.167
Bob's gonna be coming in
in about an hour,

01:19.200 --> 01:21.100
picking me up, and Ermie.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.767
I don't feel comfortable
leaving her

01:22.800 --> 01:25.200
for an undetermined amount
of days on her own, out here.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.767
NARRATOR:
In order to retrieve the ATV,

01:28.800 --> 01:32.033
Sue will have to face
the thing she's spent
years avoiding...

01:32.767 --> 01:34.467
Civilisation.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.100
SUE: When I go to town
I am bombarded

01:37.133 --> 01:40.500
by jets going over,
people having
conversations everywhere.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.100
It's just way too much info.

01:45.933 --> 01:49.100
Living like this is not
something you do on a whim.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.233
I live alone.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.967
I'm very comfortable
being alone.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.300
I've always craved
extreme isolation.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.900
I register that I live alone,

02:03.933 --> 02:07.233
but that does not mean and
does not go hand in hand
with being lonely.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.733
When I go away,
I'm preoccupied with
making it bulletproof

02:13.767 --> 02:15.633
as I can, from the elements

02:15.667 --> 02:17.600
and from possible
people coming in.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.033
The windows, the doors,
are they shut?

02:20.067 --> 02:21.200
That one's shut.

02:23.033 --> 02:25.033
Those windows are secure.

02:25.967 --> 02:26.967
That door is shut.

02:28.867 --> 02:30.667
Go check the other side.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.833
Looks good on this side.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.867
You know,
in a really strong wind,

02:40.900 --> 02:44.467
these trailers will be
buckling and,
you know, twisting

02:44.500 --> 02:45.967
and it will pop the door.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.033
I have no control
over the weather.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.167
It blows like a son of a bitch
out here

02:51.200 --> 02:52.567
and the snow drifts build.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.567
(WIND WHOOSHING)

02:55.433 --> 02:57.600
The winds that I get out here

02:57.633 --> 02:59.867
can be upwards of
100 mile an hour.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.833
Let that go a few days,
and your camp is done.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.533
I mean, I could lock
every door in the place,

03:08.567 --> 03:10.967
but a lock only
keeps out an honest man.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.400
Bush law states you always
leave the door open,

03:15.433 --> 03:17.833
you always leave some food,
and fuel, and a note.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.133
And that's just the way it is.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.233
"This is Sue.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.567
"There is food
and fuel available,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.633
"please leave me a note
if you do use anything.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.000
"Remember, this is my home,
treat it with respect.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.067
"Thank you, Susan."

03:36.033 --> 03:37.933
ANDY: It's a good life
but it can be a hard life.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.800
It's one of these lives
living out here

03:40.833 --> 03:43.633
that if you screw up,
nobody pays the piper
except for you.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.633
(DOGS BARKING)

03:51.667 --> 03:53.533
When you go to set these,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.667
that's called the dog,
that goes back.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.567
Push down.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.033
You always leave that one up.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.133
-Okay.
-Okay?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.267
Pinch it with your fingers.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.167
That goes over top of it.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.300
And then you use your finger
from underneath,
to hold the pan there.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.367
When I moved out here,

04:09.400 --> 04:11.633
I didn't know jack shit
about anything.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.633
I really had
no trapping skills,

04:13.667 --> 04:17.200
but it became very obvious
I needed to find a way
to make a living.

04:17.233 --> 04:20.967
And I was fairly successful
at marten trapping.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.267
NARRATOR: Marten furs
are coveted by trappers,

04:23.300 --> 04:26.633
typically fetching close to
$150 per pelt.

04:28.133 --> 04:31.500
Cody's got to make a living
and that means
going out trapping.

04:31.533 --> 04:34.100
NARRATOR: Cody Allen recently
moved up from the lower 48

04:34.133 --> 04:37.567
in order to learn
the subsistence lifestyle
from Kate and Andy.

04:39.367 --> 04:42.300
These are fairly powerful.
They'll hurt your finger.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.267
They're not gonna
break your finger
if you get caught,

04:44.300 --> 04:46.100
but it's gonna hurt like hell
if you do it.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.900
We're gonna basically
wire these up,

04:47.933 --> 04:51.433
we're gonna boil
some water outside,
get this oil off of them,

04:51.467 --> 04:52.800
and then we'll be set
with that.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.633
First thing I think
I'd like you to do,

04:54.667 --> 04:56.833
is just take a pair
of wire cutters,

04:56.867 --> 04:58.667
I've got this
bailing wire here.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.400
Okay?

05:00.433 --> 05:02.600
-You're gonna take this...
-Yeah.

05:02.633 --> 05:03.900
Put a couple bends in it.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.800
What that's gonna do is,
when we make the set,

05:05.833 --> 05:09.133
this is gonna go around a pole
or around a branch, right?

05:09.167 --> 05:10.800
And tie it off.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.933
This second thing
I want you to do,

05:12.967 --> 05:15.567
is you take the wire,
you go through here,

05:15.600 --> 05:19.433
so that it's basically
like that. Right?

05:19.467 --> 05:21.167
Bring that one around,

05:21.200 --> 05:24.533
and this one, you want to tie
fairly tight, onto there.

05:24.567 --> 05:25.933
-So just grab it.
-Okay.

05:25.967 --> 05:27.433
-Twist it,
so it's fairly tight.
-And turn it up?

05:27.467 --> 05:28.567
Yeah.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.900
ANDY: Probably, the first
year or two,

05:29.933 --> 05:31.967
that's gonna be your only way
of making any money.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.367
As much as you don't need
money out here,

05:34.400 --> 05:35.967
you still need money out here.

05:37.867 --> 05:40.900
You're gonna have to buy ammo.
You're gonna have to buy
some food.

05:40.933 --> 05:43.867
Trapping is kind of an issue
down in the lower 48.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.733
You know, there's a lot
of people who don't like fur,

05:45.767 --> 05:47.633
people who do like fur.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.400
And I've never actually seen
what it takes to get fur.

05:51.433 --> 05:53.200
Never reach inside of there,

05:53.233 --> 05:55.567
-'cause if it snaps shut,
it's gonna hurt.
-Yeah.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.900
Your trap's sitting there,
it's on the pole.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.500
The animal runs up the pole

06:00.533 --> 06:02.867
trying to get to the bait
that's hanging.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.400
It steps one foot,
sometimes, two foot into that.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.300
It gets caught,
jumps off the pole,

06:08.333 --> 06:09.900
and then he's hanging
off the pole.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.533
-Okay?
-All right.

06:11.567 --> 06:14.667
So we're gonna boil these
to get all the oil
and everything off of them,

06:14.700 --> 06:15.933
and then take them out,
hang them up,

06:15.967 --> 06:17.533
-and let them
cool tonight, okay?
-Okay.

06:20.033 --> 06:21.100
(CHUCKLING)

06:23.400 --> 06:24.767
CODY: Yeah, buddy.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.633
ANDY: Got it? That'll work.
CODY: Yeah.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.967
ANDY: We gotta get
these things boiled up,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.333
and get the oil off of
these things.

06:38.367 --> 06:42.433
When they make them
at the factory
they put a lot of oil on them,

06:42.467 --> 06:43.633
to keep them from rusting.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.533
I want that oil off 'cause
the animals could smell that.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.967
I also like the traps
to take on a little bit,
a slight rusty colour.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
We'll let those
dry up overnight,

06:52.033 --> 06:55.700
and then, tomorrow, we'll
put them in a box with some
spruce boughs and stuff.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.500
All right. Those look good.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.200
Let's get those hung up.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.467
We'll get all of our gear
together tomorrow,

07:02.500 --> 07:04.700
and do some hiking
up in the mountains.

07:04.733 --> 07:06.767
So, hopefully, we'll get
a little bit of fur for you.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.633
CODY: All right.
Sounds like a plan.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.467
CHIP: If we're not having fun,
we just don't do it.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.833
We'll just walk away.
We'll quit.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.233
When the fun's gone,
there's no point in it.

07:33.467 --> 07:35.200
This is the Arctic,
and right now

07:35.233 --> 07:36.333
it's about zero degrees.

07:36.367 --> 07:37.867
And I'm gonna go get me
some firewood,

07:37.900 --> 07:39.533
so I can quit burning
some stove oil.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.167
I prefer to use the stove oil
to heat just my water up,

07:42.200 --> 07:44.200
and maybe let me sleep
at 4:00 in the morning,

07:44.233 --> 07:45.700
so I don't have
to stoke a dying fire.

07:45.733 --> 07:49.067
But I can't really afford
the stove oil.

07:49.100 --> 07:53.100
NARRATOR: In Noorvik,
heating oil is just over
six dollars a gallon.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.167
Every dollar Chip saves
on fuel

07:55.200 --> 07:58.133
is money that he can spend
on his large family's needs.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.700
If my sled's not up to snuff,
I can't use it.

08:02.733 --> 08:03.800
This is a cargo sled.

08:03.833 --> 08:07.367
This is something
I would put wood, gasoline.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.267
If I have a tarp with it,
I put some meat.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.400
But this is an all-round
utility sled.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.933
It was on rocks quite a bit,

08:15.967 --> 08:18.200
and the rocks have taken off
the heads of my screws

08:18.233 --> 08:20.067
that are holding down
my runners.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.467
This last one gave out,
so I gotta, kind of,
be on top of all that.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.867
That's the best
that one's gonna go.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.933
People can't ride on it.
It'll beat them to death.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.400
You need a basket sled
for that.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.933
This right here is
pretty important to me, 'cause
this does a lot of work.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.567
This is my pickup truck bed.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.900
(CAROL SPEAKING)

08:58.933 --> 09:00.167
CHIP: It seized.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.567
Yeah.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.300
CHIP: It might be
a shattered piston,
I don't know.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.100
I'm gonna take it apart
and fix it, I guess.

09:05.133 --> 09:06.633
I still got to go get wood.

09:06.667 --> 09:07.967
Would you do me a favour?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.633
Take this in the house
so it thaws out,
and I can clean it up.

09:10.667 --> 09:14.000
And I'll take it apart tonight
and put it on the workbench,
okay?

09:14.033 --> 09:15.333
Thank you, babe.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.533
Tell your mom,
if I don't come back
until well after dark,

09:17.567 --> 09:19.967
it's only because
the chainsaw is
messed up, okay?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.100
-Okay.
-Thanks, bun.

09:23.933 --> 09:26.533
That changes my day.
It's gonna slow me down
quite a bit.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.533
NARRATOR: With the chainsaw
out of commission,
Chip must chop wood by hand.

09:30.567 --> 09:33.233
It does suck big time,
that's a $350 chainsaw.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.867
But I can sit here
and pitch a bitch,

09:34.900 --> 09:37.367
or I can just get to working
with what I'm going to do,

09:37.400 --> 09:38.800
and I just prefer to get
the day over.

09:38.833 --> 09:39.933
I don't want
to be mad anyway.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.267
I'll find out later
what happened,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.267
and then I'll decide whether
I should be mad or not.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.300
(CHUCKLES)

09:50.100 --> 09:53.800
If I can manage it, I'll knock
off enough wood to sell,
to buy me another chainsaw.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.567
Trees aren't very big here.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.900
They burn fast.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.333
We have eight-month winters.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.900
It's the Arctic. It's cold.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.700
So, this is a constant chore.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.200
GLENN: I think
it's a good idea to live
in the moment.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.467
You don't want to
miss the moment

10:11.500 --> 10:14.067
thinking about the future
or the past too often, do you?

10:29.967 --> 10:33.667
NARRATOR: Seven months ago,
Glenn Villeneuve left his
remote camp

10:33.700 --> 10:35.767
to spend time with
his children in town.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.800
Now that he's back
living his chosen
isolated existence,

10:41.833 --> 10:44.733
he must load up
on his most vital resource.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.500
GLENN: Since I got back
to camp,

10:49.533 --> 10:50.867
I've been melting snow
for water,

10:50.900 --> 10:53.133
and it's fine
for getting water to drink,

10:53.167 --> 10:54.200
but it takes a lot of work

10:54.233 --> 10:55.467
to get enough water
to do dishes,

10:55.500 --> 10:58.000
to do laundry, take a bath.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.133
When I take a bath
I use five gallons of water.

11:00.167 --> 11:03.933
I'd have to melt probably
15 gallons of snow
to get five gallons of water.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.433
I'd be here for hours.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.300
So today, I'm gonna go out and
chisel a hole through the ice,

11:09.333 --> 11:10.500
get water out of the lake.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.267
Once I have a hole and
I can take out 20, 30 gallons
of water at one time,

11:16.300 --> 11:19.233
and then I can take a bath,
I can do my laundry,
I can do my dishes,

11:19.267 --> 11:21.233
and I got plenty of water
for anything I want.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.167
Even though
it's 34 below zero,
I got to take clothes off

11:28.200 --> 11:31.533
because I'll just
get overheated
and I'll start perspiring,

11:31.567 --> 11:32.867
and my clothes will get damp,

11:32.900 --> 11:35.733
and then, later,
when I stop working,
I'll get cold.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.833
I make a square here
about three paces each side,

11:40.867 --> 11:43.533
because if I leave this snow
on the ice,

11:43.567 --> 11:47.267
and I just make a little,
tiny hole through the snow
where I drill my ice hole,

11:47.300 --> 11:49.267
this snow will get all packed
down around it.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.667
It will be a big mess.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.800
The snow turns to ice
after it gets
water dripping on it.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.267
I plan to keep this hole
right here, until spring.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.167
That's good.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.233
Got the ice all exposed.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.833
I'm gonna put a hole
right in the middle of it,

12:05.867 --> 12:07.500
and I'm gonna
put on a face mask.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.333
I just need to protect my skin
from freezing.

12:09.367 --> 12:10.700
It's 34 below zero

12:10.733 --> 12:14.000
and I can just feel
my ears and my nose
getting a little cold.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.900
I like to put in
a pretty big hole.

12:22.933 --> 12:25.267
It's easier for me
to keep it open.

12:26.867 --> 12:28.967
It's easier for me
to get water out of it.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.167
I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.600
I don't really care.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.933
I have all the time to do it
that it's gonna take.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.500
I just don't like to look
at a watch out here,

12:42.533 --> 12:45.300
or think about
hours and minutes.
I just keep track of the sun.

12:50.467 --> 12:52.800
I think about time
very differently out here

12:52.833 --> 12:56.700
than people think about it
down in civilisation,
you know.

12:56.733 --> 13:00.200
I don't think about
how many hours
I'm gonna spend cutting wood.

13:00.233 --> 13:03.367
The sun just goes around
in a circle in the summer,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.833
the moon goes around
in a circle in the winter,

13:07.100 --> 13:09.633
those are the time keepers
out here.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.433
I don't know how thick
the ice is,

13:19.467 --> 13:22.067
but I think it's probably
at least three feet thick.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.700
I can feel it in my feet

13:25.733 --> 13:29.267
that when I strike
the ice now, it vibrates.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.700
I'm getting close.

13:34.667 --> 13:35.833
Water!

13:41.800 --> 13:42.900
Yeah.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.167
Nice.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.267
Hit water.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.000
As soon as I hit water,
the hole filled up.

14:02.033 --> 14:06.167
But, I still have to make it
the same diameter,
all the way to the bottom.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.633
I need to get all the ice out
at the bottom,

14:10.667 --> 14:13.000
so it doesn't refreeze
too quickly.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.100
Look at this, it's ripping the
leather off my glove

14:15.133 --> 14:18.800
when it, I just splashed it
and I froze my glove,
34 below zero.

14:22.167 --> 14:25.800
Once I get the hole
the same diameter
all the way down through,

14:25.833 --> 14:29.533
then I don't have to
worry about it
refreezing so fast.

14:29.567 --> 14:32.233
I'll be able to leave it open
the rest of the day.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.633
That's the stuff
down at the bottom
I'm chiselling out right now.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.367
I can feel it.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.467
Now I'm gonna
take a slush scoop
and just clean that ice out.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.533
I do have to be careful
walking around the hole

15:01.567 --> 15:05.567
because these mukluks,
they're warm but they
don't have the best traction.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.100
The lake water is
so nice and clear.
It's so nice to drink it.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.300
I never purify the water
or boil it.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.267
I just drink
straight out of the lake.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.633
You can't do that
in a lot of places any more.

15:23.667 --> 15:27.933
Up here, things are still
clean enough, you can drink
right out of the lake.

15:27.967 --> 15:31.033
Happy to have a hole
through the ice now and
get my water out of this lake,

15:31.067 --> 15:32.400
instead of having
to melt snow every day.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.467
Okay, I'm gonna go
get my sled, and my buckets,

15:34.500 --> 15:35.767
and get some of this water.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.400
First thing I'm gonna do
with this water
is take a bath.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.900
ANDY: Pretty much everything
I've learnt to do out here,
I've learnt on my own.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.300
Trial and error.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.467
Seems like more error
than trial.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.033
(DOGS BARKING)

16:01.133 --> 16:02.300
Attaboys.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.967
Up we go. Straight ahead.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.900
NARRATOR:
If Cody's going to make a life
for himself in the bush,

16:08.433 --> 16:09.600
he has to master

16:09.633 --> 16:11.733
the fundamentals
of trapping fur.

16:13.733 --> 16:15.267
ANDY: Attaboys.
Straight ahead.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.033
Attaboy. Little more. Gee.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.967
The trail's over there.
There you go, buddy.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.933
Cody and I are getting ready
to set a walking trap line
up in the hills.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.967
Attaboy! Good job.
Right there.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.800
Good job, Iceberg.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.300
Good boys.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.133
We'll picket out the dogs,

16:42.167 --> 16:46.333
which means to basically
tie them off to a cable
between two trees.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.533
And that way,
they can just lay down,
take a nap,

16:48.567 --> 16:51.233
and wait for us
while we're out
setting the traps.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.833
I'm gonna take one dog
with us.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.067
Good boy. All right.
You know what
work is all about, huh?

16:56.100 --> 16:58.267
Iceberg is gonna have a pack
on him.

16:58.300 --> 17:02.067
He'll be carrying baits,
traps, snares,
things like that

17:02.100 --> 17:04.567
so that I don't have
to pack it.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.967
CODY:
Say I'm a little bit nervous
and apprehensive about today.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.567
I mean, still kind of
on the fence
about it a little bit.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.467
We'll see how I feel about it
when it happens.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.300
I mean, it's not that
one-shot, quick, clean kill.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.767
It's a little bit more harsh
on the animal.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.033
ANDY: Let's go.

17:21.267 --> 17:22.333
Come on, buddy boy.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.200
I don't know how much
Cody's walked around
on snowshoes.

17:28.233 --> 17:31.067
It's a completely different
way of moving
through the country.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.433
Snowshoes aren't exactly
modern technology.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.800
And it takes some
practise to know how to step,
and where to step,

17:43.833 --> 17:46.100
and how to negotiate
steep inclines.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.533
CODY:
This one's not set up right,

17:52.567 --> 17:55.633
so every time I step,
it's not letting my toe
slip past the front,

17:55.667 --> 17:57.400
and walk like I should be.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.433
Taking off some of the clothes
right now.

18:06.467 --> 18:09.300
I'm gonna keep myself
from getting too wet.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.800
When you start working
you gotta strip down,

18:14.833 --> 18:16.167
and start the day cold.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.233
'Cause you're gonna get hot
during the day.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.667
CODY:
This is difficult all around.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.200
I mean, I'm just now learning
how to walk in snowshoes.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.667
They're not making
for a very enjoyable hike.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.533
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

18:29.567 --> 18:31.033
Please stay on.

18:36.367 --> 18:37.500
God damn it.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.233
Son of a bitch.

18:44.567 --> 18:47.733
Gee. Gee, up.

18:50.367 --> 18:53.233
CODY: I kind of feel like
I'm out in the
middle of nowhere,

18:53.267 --> 18:54.967
having some extreme issues,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.533
and I know Andy's probably
farther up that hill.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.300
Come on, boy!

19:04.233 --> 19:05.600
Pump it.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.800
He's doing pretty good.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.233
I don't think he's used to
walking on snowshoes
and that takes practise.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.500
I think he's having
a lot of problems
with slipping, falling.

19:15.533 --> 19:16.767
And that gets
really exhausting.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.667
I'm working on it.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.100
My dog just had
a 10-minute nap
waiting for you.

19:24.133 --> 19:25.800
This is where the fur is.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.233
So I wanna make a couple
marten sets around here.

19:38.267 --> 19:39.967
CODY:
I noticed a lot of tracks.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.433
Just pick a tree.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.967
-Go do your thing.
-All righty.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.233
Best case scenario for today
is gonna be

19:56.267 --> 19:58.833
getting some traps set up
in a good position, with bait,

19:58.867 --> 20:01.433
getting back down to
the bottom of the hill,
and warming up.

20:07.767 --> 20:09.467
Get this bait set.

20:15.433 --> 20:19.600
Right here, we got
a piece of nice
salmon steak.

20:19.633 --> 20:24.167
Normally it's dog food,
but today it's gonna double
as bait for a marten trap.

20:24.200 --> 20:29.000
And you just hang it
so a marten comes up,
walks down this guy,

20:29.033 --> 20:30.333
and as he's trying to
get to there,

20:30.367 --> 20:33.000
he's focused on this and
not so much looking at this.

20:33.033 --> 20:36.133
And when he steps
across, snap,

20:36.167 --> 20:39.700
and we've got ourselves
a little bit of money
in the pocket.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.300
ANDY: He's picking up
the trapping part
pretty quick.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.100
A lot of enthusiasm.
He's paying attention.

20:46.133 --> 20:47.633
A few things a little awkward,

20:47.667 --> 20:50.567
but that's normal for anybody
doing something
for the first time.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.700
Shit.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.000
The whole trapping idea
in my head at first,

20:56.033 --> 21:00.700
I was kind of up in arms
about it, just 'cause of,
it's trapping,

21:00.733 --> 21:03.000
you know, it's not
one shot, one kill.
It's not clean.

21:03.033 --> 21:07.800
But after hiking and
working my butt off
to get up that trail,

21:07.833 --> 21:10.300
and setting traps,
and setting the bait,

21:10.333 --> 21:12.933
if I don't catch something,
(CHUCKLES) I'm gonna be
quite disappointed.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.200
Should work.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.667
Hopefully, I get
some money out of it.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.567
SUE: I wonder sometimes
if people really realise

21:24.600 --> 21:27.267
how much
ever-present noise there is.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.700
Jesus Christ.

21:29.733 --> 21:30.867
It makes me batty.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.233
Come on, girl.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.000
You better get your business
done.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.933
Ermie and I have to
get out of camp.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.267
I made a new acquisition,

21:51.300 --> 21:53.067
and this is something

21:53.100 --> 21:54.533
that cannot fit
in an aeroplane,

21:54.567 --> 21:56.700
and definitely won't go
in my back pocket.

21:56.733 --> 22:00.100
So, we are on a journey
to retrieve it.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.033
Come on, Ermie.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.267
(SUE GRUNTS)

22:03.300 --> 22:06.300
(CHUCKLES) I can't pick her
up that high with my back.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
(SUE SPEAKING)

22:26.767 --> 22:29.500
SUE: I am excited to be
going to Deadhorse,
going to town.

22:29.533 --> 22:32.433
You know, there are
some luxuries there
that I don't get,

22:32.467 --> 22:34.533
but a lot of trepidation, too.

22:45.667 --> 22:49.500
This is exactly one year
since I was in Deadhorse.

22:49.533 --> 22:52.300
This place stinks. (LAUGHS)

22:52.333 --> 22:54.367
This is an industrial place.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.800
It's got... Ugh!

22:57.433 --> 22:59.567
Exhaust smell, engine smell,

23:01.033 --> 23:03.167
noise, lights.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.067
It's daunting.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.533
I've got my own little world
going on up there.

23:09.567 --> 23:14.700
I can give myself the illusion
that I am the centre
of my personal sphere.

23:14.733 --> 23:18.233
But when I get into town,
I'm just another ant
in the ant farm.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.800
Okay, that's unusual to me.

23:23.833 --> 23:26.367
If I'm not running it,
what the hell
is that doing moving?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.733
You know,
there's other people here.

23:30.967 --> 23:33.300
But I want that. I want that.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.833
That's cool. I want one.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.633
Next stop, Prudhoe Bay Hotel.

23:43.667 --> 23:47.067
I mean, I talk about
everything is alien
and it's, ah, a little creepy,

23:47.100 --> 23:49.600
but they have hot showers.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.733
I could put up with
a hell of a lot of creepy

23:51.767 --> 23:53.200
to get some
scrubbing going down.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.833
CHIP: We don't have roads,
we don't have speed limits,

23:57.867 --> 24:02.300
we don't have stop signs.
We don't have flashing
red lights or green lights.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.867
My driver's licence expired
in 1991.

24:14.733 --> 24:17.433
NARRATOR: With plunging winter
temperatures in Noorvik,

24:17.467 --> 24:19.967
Chip has two choices
to warm his home,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.733
spend cash on heating oil or
head out on his snow machine

24:23.767 --> 24:25.000
and chop down firewood.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.633
CHIP: I go to the
last spring's break up ice,

24:35.667 --> 24:37.833
hit the banks,
and knock these trees over.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.567
And they've been drying
all summer.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.767
Nobody else has been here.
I don't see a mark on them.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.900
They haven't been claimed.

24:44.633 --> 24:45.933
So, I'm free to
get what I want

24:45.967 --> 24:47.067
off the riverbank.

24:48.333 --> 24:50.200
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
So that's what I'm doing.

24:50.233 --> 24:52.667
I have a lot of chopping
to do, and not much sunlight.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.733
So I'm gonna get to this.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.933
I need heat whether
I have a chainsaw working
or not.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.300
Like Abraham Lincoln said,

25:05.333 --> 25:07.700
he who cuts his own wood
warms himself twice.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.100
So, I think I'm gonna be
pretty freaking warm here
for a while.

25:18.633 --> 25:20.167
This is subsistence heating.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.233
This is getting heat from
the material around us.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.600
Oh, I got an accident for you.

25:38.633 --> 25:42.100
Last summer, I was
cutting wood in my yard.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.967
My axe handle broke,

25:44.000 --> 25:48.267
my double bitted axe flew up,
stuck in my forehead.

25:48.300 --> 25:51.200
And this scar right here is
where I pulled the axe
out of my head.

25:52.967 --> 25:55.467
I got a big piece of bone
that came out of the cut,

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
and is lodged right here,
making a lump.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.667
And I bled all over the place.

26:01.700 --> 26:05.633
That's my axe story,
and I'm sticking to it
'cause it stuck to me.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.100
This is another tree.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.333
The pine needles
are dead on it.

26:11.367 --> 26:14.667
It's dry and it's going home
with me.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.667
I think that's enough
for today.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.167
It's almost dark
and there's no more dry ones
laying around.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.367
Whoa.

26:30.467 --> 26:34.067
I got some heat here
for the next few days.

26:34.100 --> 26:37.200
Three trees together,
I have three days'
worth of wood.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.800
I hauled a lot of wood
and I saved a lot of money,

26:39.833 --> 26:41.700
not buying a lot of stove oil.

26:44.467 --> 26:47.000
I need a fire started
pretty quick

26:47.033 --> 26:50.000
inside the house
in the wood stove.

26:50.033 --> 26:53.400
If you're lazy about heat,
it'll be what we call
parka time.

26:53.433 --> 26:55.933
And that's when people
who have run out of heat
completely

26:55.967 --> 26:57.967
put their parkas on
and sit in their house.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.600
Probably next to a candle.

27:03.067 --> 27:04.300
Kindling.

27:07.733 --> 27:10.033
Tomorrow, I will borrow
someone's chainsaw.

27:26.167 --> 27:29.133
AGNES: Wow,
I find a pretty good
dinner for tonight, Idi.

27:29.167 --> 27:31.633
Care to join us
for a good nook back?

27:31.667 --> 27:33.033
Yeah, even muktuk.

27:33.067 --> 27:35.667
We're gonna have a feast
night tonight.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.733
When we sit down and
eat native foods,

27:37.767 --> 27:39.500
it's a nook back.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.933
And when we're eating,
it's nika piak took.

27:43.667 --> 27:47.700
Frozen foods, dried foods,

27:47.733 --> 27:51.733
and all your berries
to sweeten stuff up,
and all the fats.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.200
Yummy.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.333
CAROL: My card wouldn't
go on it!

27:57.367 --> 27:59.167
So what?
My card's still on there!

27:59.200 --> 28:01.933
-Then mine will go
right there.
-Cheater!

28:01.967 --> 28:04.300
CHIP:
Fairly normal dinner here
that we've got going.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.733
I wanted tongue,
so there's tongue.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.667
There's a bible,
which is a ruminants bag

28:07.700 --> 28:09.300
and it's full of the tundra
that the caribou chewed up.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.100
This is one of their
stomach chambers.

28:11.133 --> 28:12.300
And we boil this up,

28:12.333 --> 28:13.933
and we'll chop it up,
and we'll add it to rice.

28:13.967 --> 28:17.500
These right here are from
caribou that we got up here
on Kobuk River.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.467
AGNES: Carolyn. The big one.
Right in front of you.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.500
-(GUNSHOT)
-Got it!

28:26.867 --> 28:30.167
CHIP: This is qualghuq,
which is a kind of green
that we get from the tundra

28:30.200 --> 28:31.467
and we boil and ferment.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.067
And this is pretty tasty.

28:33.100 --> 28:37.200
And then over here
are aqpiks, which they call
salmonberries in other places.

28:37.233 --> 28:39.500
And it's a pretty good berry.
It's full of Vitamin C.

28:39.533 --> 28:44.033
This here is seal oil blubber
from the seal that my wife
and my son brought home.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.333
One, two, three. Go.

28:49.933 --> 28:51.133
Hey!

28:51.167 --> 28:53.933
This is a soft,
half dried caribou.

28:53.967 --> 28:56.033
And this is pretty good stuff.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.100
Then I have some completely
dried and crumbly.

28:58.133 --> 29:00.233
This is pretty
freaking hard stuff.

29:00.267 --> 29:01.833
It will shatter
if you break it up.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.967
And then these are pike
from this last summer,
that we dried up.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.500
Food is kind of
what it's all about.

29:08.533 --> 29:11.000
We basically make a living
on the chase for food.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.300
This is a salmon from when
we were down
in our salmon camp.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.433
When we were at Kookoochaiq.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.200
It's all for good health.

29:21.033 --> 29:22.633
Everybody has their hand
in this stuff

29:22.667 --> 29:23.867
and everybody knows
where it came from.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.667
So, it always makes it
taste a little bit better.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.800
Come on, kiddos.
Come get a plate.

29:31.667 --> 29:32.667
Excuse me.

29:37.633 --> 29:40.000
CHIP: I'm drizzling seal oil
all over it.

29:40.033 --> 29:42.300
It's a way of taking
all these lean meats
and fattening them up.

29:42.333 --> 29:44.567
And it's got a flavour
I kinda like.

29:44.600 --> 29:48.767
And I don't know,
it's just good.
It's my dinner. (LAUGHS)

29:51.900 --> 29:55.033
For me, the social setting
here is the same
at these kind of dinners,

29:55.067 --> 29:56.467
as it was when I was a kid.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.867
Our family got together
on weekends
and especially at dinnertime.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.867
That's when I saw
my mom and dad the most.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.233
And it's kind of, like,
the same way with us.

30:03.267 --> 30:05.033
We all gather again
at the end of the day.

30:05.067 --> 30:06.500
Mom, what is this called?

30:06.533 --> 30:08.267
It's greens. Qualghuq.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.433
-QUTAN: You told him...
-Greens.

30:11.633 --> 30:13.700
CHIP: The chase
is a good healthy thing.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.300
The food
is a good healthy thing.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.933
Knowing the
proper preparations

30:16.967 --> 30:18.367
makes for a smart person.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.900
And you live long, live good,

30:20.933 --> 30:23.300
and you don't rely on anybody
but yourself.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.200
SUE: Can't be Mary Poppins
about it, man.

30:31.233 --> 30:32.733
(LAUGHS)

30:32.767 --> 30:35.000
It's not always
a beautiful day
in the neighbourhood.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.567
Sometimes, it's game on.

30:47.533 --> 30:50.467
I'm here because I've got
some new equipment,

30:50.500 --> 30:52.300
and made it to my specs,

30:52.333 --> 30:56.000
and I need to get ready,
go over and see it
for the very first time.

30:58.233 --> 31:02.600
NARRATOR: Travelling across
the Arctic tundra requires
specialised equipment.

31:02.633 --> 31:05.333
Today, Sue is picking up
an all-terrain vehicle

31:05.367 --> 31:08.633
she hopes will give her
greater mobility
in and around Kavik.

31:10.933 --> 31:13.700
SUE: I know in my mind
what it looks like,

31:13.733 --> 31:16.500
but kid in a candy store,
it's different when
you actually get to see it.

31:19.367 --> 31:20.900
I feel like I'm on the moon.

31:22.567 --> 31:25.200
The first thing that hits me
is the change of colour scheme

31:25.233 --> 31:27.567
in Kavik, because
I don't get the sun yet,

31:27.600 --> 31:29.733
it has to, it's still
below my horizon.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
Very much in the
way of yellow light.

31:33.533 --> 31:36.867
I get a little bit of pinks
because the sun can
reach my clouds,

31:36.900 --> 31:39.267
but not, you know,
my landscape.

31:39.300 --> 31:42.333
So, this orange and yellow,
that's brand new.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.333
I haven't seen that
since October.

31:48.367 --> 31:51.700
I don't get the opportunity
to buy things for myself,

31:51.733 --> 31:55.267
and this represents...
It's not just a vehicle.

31:55.300 --> 31:56.867
It's not just a tool.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.133
This is so emotional.

31:59.167 --> 32:04.100
It represents getting
my personal freedom back,
my ability to explore.

32:05.733 --> 32:08.000
Okay. There's tyre tracks.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.600
Oh, wow!

32:12.633 --> 32:14.067
Oh, it's so cute!

32:17.167 --> 32:19.500
Check it out, home fries.

32:22.067 --> 32:24.733
Maybe, I should've counted
on the fact that
I'm a little fat.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.000
(ENGINE STARTING)

32:35.933 --> 32:36.933
(HORN HONKING)

32:39.600 --> 32:42.233
This is a really unique rig,

32:42.267 --> 32:45.333
specifically for these kind
of conditions.

32:45.367 --> 32:47.167
It's an
all-year-round vehicle.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.667
I'm not used to driving.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.200
I'm mobile.

32:51.233 --> 32:54.200
If I wanna go see
some amazing site, I don't
have to worry I'm alone,

32:54.233 --> 32:56.667
and I can't do it on foot
'cause I'll freeze to death.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.233
I'm overwhelmed that
I'm gonna have
my mobility back.

33:00.267 --> 33:01.967
I'm gonna have my freedom.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.467
It's a little smaller
than I anticipated,

33:05.500 --> 33:06.567
but it's pretty cool.

33:07.967 --> 33:10.100
It's, uh, it's mine.

33:15.900 --> 33:20.067
GLENN: I think when you have
fewer things,
you have a clearer mind.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.900
And you definitely have
a different relationship
with the things you have.

33:22.933 --> 33:24.500
They mean more to you.

33:39.967 --> 33:41.767
One thing I really enjoy about
living out here,

33:41.800 --> 33:43.233
is all these jobs, you know.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.767
Because you get
a very concrete
reward out of it.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.800
I really enjoy living
this way.

33:51.833 --> 33:55.100
I like heating my water
this way, cutting my firewood,
taking a bath outdoors.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.667
It just keeps you
fit and alive,

33:56.700 --> 33:59.100
and I don't know, I just feel
really vital out here.

34:03.733 --> 34:04.867
Water's good and hot.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.700
I'm just adjusting
the temperature.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.233
I want it about as hot
as I can tolerate ideally.

34:13.267 --> 34:15.067
Yeah. That's just right.

34:15.100 --> 34:18.400
And then I like to leave
the stove going, good and hot,

34:18.433 --> 34:20.800
so that when I come back in,
I can warm right up.

34:20.833 --> 34:24.967
I tell you, I remember getting
pretty strung out one time,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.233
with just too much going on,
and I didn't take a bath
for a long time.

34:28.267 --> 34:31.667
I mean, one winter
I really didn't bathe
hardly at all that...

34:31.700 --> 34:33.667
I was just, I was too busy.

34:33.700 --> 34:38.167
So, I realised, "Wow,
I haven't taken a bath
or washed my clothes in ages."

34:47.933 --> 34:49.833
What a nice day for a bath.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.600
It's up to 28 below.

34:56.633 --> 35:00.533
As long as the water's
hot enough, you can
actually take plenty of time.

35:00.567 --> 35:03.700
You don't really have to
worry too much
about getting frostbite

35:03.733 --> 35:06.067
if there's no breeze.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.400
If it's calm, I'll take baths
down to 40 below, no problem.

35:09.433 --> 35:10.733
Maybe even colder.

35:12.267 --> 35:15.167
Sometimes, you feel the hairs
getting a little frozen,

35:15.200 --> 35:18.533
but as long as the skin
doesn't get frozen,
no problem.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.867
With the hole through
the ice like that,

35:19.900 --> 35:22.133
I can take a bath as often
as I want to.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.667
If I'm melting snow,
I don't take a bath
very often.

35:25.733 --> 35:28.000
Oh, that hot water
feels so nice, though.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.700
Okay.

35:37.733 --> 35:39.033
Out of water.

35:39.067 --> 35:40.800
Okay. I'm starting
to get a little chilly.

35:40.833 --> 35:43.667
So I better slip
these boots on.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.133
I've only been out here
a few minutes.

35:48.267 --> 35:51.067
Look at that view.
Isn't that beautiful?

35:54.400 --> 35:56.200
ANDY: The way
of doing this life is,

35:56.233 --> 35:57.933
you get ahead
by needing less.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.233
CODY: Today, Andy sent me
out here

36:19.267 --> 36:20.933
to come check
on the traps by myself,

36:20.967 --> 36:22.533
and kind of
a little bit nervous.

36:22.567 --> 36:25.200
Wanna make sure
I don't get lost, but you know
with the snow how it is,

36:25.233 --> 36:27.167
I should be able to
follow my tracks pretty easy.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.567
Still kind of a little freaky
to be out here by myself.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.033
That first set's right there.

36:37.067 --> 36:38.333
It's gonna be a hard day.

36:38.367 --> 36:40.100
I'm still on the fence
about all this.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.267
I mean, it's taking
an animal's life.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.367
Can't ever feel good
about that, but you gotta
make money to live.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.867
If you ain't got cash
in your pocket,

36:46.900 --> 36:49.067
you're pretty much broke
and on the street.

36:49.100 --> 36:53.067
Looks like the first trap
came across here,
and nothing here right now,

36:53.100 --> 36:56.967
but you know, hopefully
I'll come back another time
and might be something there.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.167
But for now, we're just
gonna leave it
and keep on pushing on.

37:05.267 --> 37:08.467
I think my biggest problem is
just gonna be, maybe coming up
on an animal in a trap,

37:08.500 --> 37:09.800
for the first time.

37:09.833 --> 37:12.433
You know, if it's still alive,
I'm gonna have to
put it down.

37:12.467 --> 37:13.700
Got another trap over here,

37:15.900 --> 37:20.367
and from the looks of it,
nothing's really been
through here.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.600
I don't see any fresh tracks
coming through here.

37:22.633 --> 37:24.900
Should probably just
leave it alone
and come back another day.

37:29.667 --> 37:34.867
Make sure I mark my trail,
and blaze some trees.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.500
With the snow,
it's not too bad,

37:36.533 --> 37:41.467
but you know, you want to
have a good sight line
going up and going back down.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.967
You get caught in a blizzard
up here,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.333
it'd be pretty damn easy
to get turned around.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.933
Well, trap still looks good.

38:00.567 --> 38:01.567
Bait looks good.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.967
Everything looks fine,
just no animal.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.433
It's gonna be depressing
if none of these
have anything in them.

38:08.467 --> 38:09.967
A lot of work for nothing.

38:16.133 --> 38:19.567
Yeah, there's freaking
marten tracks everywhere,

38:19.600 --> 38:22.000
and haven't caught
a single one.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.933
I got one more set to check.

38:23.967 --> 38:25.533
Hopefully, there's something
in there.

38:25.567 --> 38:29.033
If not, this was a hell
of a long day
for absolutely nothing.

38:34.733 --> 38:36.200
Gotta keep on keeping on.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.667
First trap on this line
is a bust.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.933
These traps I set
pretty close to each other

38:43.967 --> 38:46.367
so I'd be able to kind of
eye one from the other,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.667
and I can already look at
my next trap down the row,

38:48.700 --> 38:51.433
and tell there's nothing
in it.

38:51.467 --> 38:54.033
This is really
starting to get depressing.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.667
Every time I take a step,
I'm sinking down,
like, two feet.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.433
So, throw on the snowshoes.

39:03.467 --> 39:06.200
Snowshoes keep you
from sweating and
working a little bit too hard.

39:14.433 --> 39:15.567
Son of a gun.

39:17.167 --> 39:19.267
This is starting
to piss me off.

39:20.433 --> 39:22.633
I don't feel so bad
for those animals any more.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.567
They're elusive
little bastards.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.333
Losing motivation
every time I see a trap empty,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.533
but I only got
so much light left.

39:31.567 --> 39:33.833
So I need to go get
the rest of these checked out,

39:33.867 --> 39:35.667
and get my butt back
down the hill

39:35.700 --> 39:37.767
while I can still see my trail
good and clearly.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.000
Otherwise, I could find myself
in a predicament

39:40.033 --> 39:41.133
I really don't wanna
end up in.

39:43.367 --> 39:45.300
Son of a bitch!

39:45.333 --> 39:47.400
I'm a little bit more
off the fence,

39:47.433 --> 39:48.933
I guess, about it now.

39:48.967 --> 39:50.667
It's definitely a fair fight.

39:50.700 --> 39:53.767
If they're smart enough
to avoid this or not go after
a nice piece of hanging fish,

39:53.800 --> 39:56.633
then they're smart enough
to live another day.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.733
I got one more coming up.

40:04.767 --> 40:07.700
If there's nothing in that,
then we got skunked.

40:07.733 --> 40:10.033
This should be
the last set in my trap.

40:10.067 --> 40:12.533
As soon as I come around
this brush,

40:12.567 --> 40:14.800
find out if I got lucky or...

40:15.900 --> 40:17.100
I got nothing.

40:21.433 --> 40:26.100
This trapping thing has
just created mixed feelings
this entire time.

40:26.133 --> 40:29.733
I mean, I'm staring at this
right now just wishing
there was an animal in it,

40:29.767 --> 40:31.700
and, of course, there's not.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.467
And that's a paycheck
gone right there.

40:39.167 --> 40:42.000
I guess I kind of had it
in my mind
that we'd come back

40:42.033 --> 40:43.733
and there'd be animals
in every single one,

40:43.767 --> 40:46.033
and I'd have a whole
bunch of cash in my pocket.

40:46.067 --> 40:47.733
It's gonna be a lot tougher
than I thought it was.

40:50.900 --> 40:54.133
GLENN: Just being connected
to the whole flow
of nature out here.

40:54.167 --> 40:57.600
When you're living in town,
you can even lose track of
what phase the moon is in.

40:57.633 --> 41:00.200
Like, that would be
totally unthinkable out here.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.067
I'm gonna go down now

41:10.100 --> 41:12.867
and I'm gonna cover up my
water hole with snow
to insulate it.

41:15.767 --> 41:18.067
If I don't insulate it,
that thing will freeze solid

41:18.100 --> 41:19.500
and I'll have to start
all over again.

41:19.533 --> 41:22.100
There'd be a whole lot of work
chiselling it out again,

41:22.133 --> 41:24.967
but if I insulate it
real well,
next time I open it up,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.867
there might only be
a couple inches of ice.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.633
This hole's frozen over now,

41:31.667 --> 41:34.567
and I can tell by the cracks
in the ice how thick it is.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.667
It looks like I've got already
about a half an inch of ice.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.567
So there's plenty of ice
to cover it with snow.

41:40.600 --> 41:45.033
It's about 30 below zero out,
and that water's about
32 above.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.433
So this is gonna keep
the heat of that water
in there.

41:47.467 --> 41:49.800
Keep the hole
from freezing in too fast.

41:51.367 --> 41:54.667
With this snow I might have
2, 3, 4, 6 inches of ice

41:54.700 --> 41:56.667
when I want to open this up
in three or four days.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.900
Without this snow,

41:58.933 --> 42:00.667
I could have
a foot-and-a-half
or two feet of ice

42:00.700 --> 42:01.833
to chisel through, easy.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.733
I spent seven years getting
ready to move out here.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.800
Seven years before
I ever came out here,

42:10.833 --> 42:13.133
I decided this was what
I wanted to do,
just go live in the wilderness

42:13.167 --> 42:17.067
in the Brooks Range,
and during that time period
I was preparing,

42:17.100 --> 42:19.333
arranging my life
so I could do it.

42:19.367 --> 42:21.367
Studying the information
I needed in order to do it,

42:21.400 --> 42:24.133
and then, of course,
you come out here
and you learn more.

42:24.167 --> 42:25.400
You know, when you see
how things

42:25.433 --> 42:26.467
work and don't work.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.333
The way I live
is a mental comfort to me.

42:30.367 --> 42:32.967
It's comforting to be
close to nature,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.633
and to be really connected
to all the resources I use.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.200
Physically it's a demanding
way to live,

42:40.233 --> 42:42.133
but psychologically,
I actually find it easier

42:42.167 --> 42:43.600
than living in modern society.
