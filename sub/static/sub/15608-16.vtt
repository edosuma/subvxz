himself, Griff.

wanna play you.

08:30.540 --> 08:31.830
Why not?

08:31.830 --> 08:33.880
Are you scared?
Dude.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.750
I was in a cell
for two years

08:35.750 --> 08:39.210
with a guy who wore
a necklace made out of
other people's earlobes.

08:39.710 --> 08:42.290
I'm not scared.

08:42.290 --> 08:45.960
I am actually now
a little scared that
we share a cabin.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.790
Look, I'm really good
at this game.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.500
I was in the juvie team.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.620
Our motto was,
"Throw it in the hole,
or get thrown in the hole."

08:54.380 --> 08:55.960
My motto is,

08:55.960 --> 08:58.540
"If no one smelt it
no one dealt it."

09:00.290 --> 09:02.380
Jorge, that does not
really apply here.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.080
(SNIFFS)
Wait now it does.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.750
Thanks again, guys,
for giving Chuck
a second chance.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.710
Thank you, for putting
in the hard work
and training him.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.540
It was easy.
Chuck paid close attention

09:14.540 --> 09:17.290
and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised
with the results.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.170
Oh, no!

09:23.170 --> 09:27.080
Clearly a mountain lion
broke in here and
destroyed the cabin.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.790
Chuck, are you okay?

09:30.750 --> 09:34.170
Oh, great.
Now we have a mountain lion
to deal with too?

09:35.540 --> 09:38.170
Fortunately,
when her looks go
she'll still be rich.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.080
Guys, I'm really sorry,
but it was Chuck's
first day of school.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.540
It took me a whole month
just to learn my a, b, d's.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.830
That's it.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.330
Lou, we've had it.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.170
We can't live
like this anymore.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.460
Chuck has to go.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.620
Fine.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.790
But if Chuck has to go,
I'm going with him.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.710
We're going.

10:05.290 --> 10:06.420
We're almost there.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.170
I can't believe
you're gonna make us
sleep out there

10:11.170 --> 10:13.330
on the cold hard ground.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.380
If you want a bed,
you can have mine.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.880
By the way,
those sheets
used to be white.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.080
Cold hard ground it is.

10:27.170 --> 10:30.120
If I'm gonna beat Griff,
I need my lucky underwear.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.170
Huh, oh, well.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.040
Maybe my lucky gum
will help.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.080
That wasn't gum.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Griff, I need to talk
to you about Jorge.
I need a big favor.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.210
Dude, anything
for a friend.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.210
Give me five bucks.

10:51.210 --> 10:55.330
What? Do you not know
the difference between
a favor and extortion?

10:55.330 --> 10:57.750
Yeah, the difference
is five bucks.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.170
RAVI: Very well.

11:00.170 --> 11:04.580
But I must insist upon
a no backsies clause
in our agreement.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.620
Griff, I need you
to let Jorge win that
beanbag competition.

11:08.620 --> 11:11.620
No way. There are
two things I don't do.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.210
Lose, and talk to cops
without my lawyer.

11:15.670 --> 11:18.080
But you already have
so much more than Jorge.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.380
You are cool, popular,
athletic, your body odor
is pleasant.

11:23.380 --> 11:26.670
If you don't get to the point,
it's gonna cost you ten bucks.

11:26.670 --> 11:29.290
I fear you are too good
for Jorge to beat.

11:29.290 --> 11:33.210
And this record means
so much for his self-esteem.

11:33.210 --> 11:38.250
Well, I hate to lose
but I really like Jorge.

11:38.250 --> 11:41.210
And I do wanna see him
get his own plaque.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.880
So, do we have a deal?

11:43.880 --> 11:47.170
(SIGHS)
All right, fine,
I'll take a dive.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.620
Griff, it is much too dark
to go swimming.
Plus, you just ate.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.380
It means
I'll lose on purpose.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.170
Give me the five bucks.

11:56.170 --> 12:00.250
Hey, I heard everything
you guys just said.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.250
Griff, you don't have
to throw the game.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.750
Because I quit.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.080
And, Ravi, I thought
you believed in me.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.290
RAVI: But...

12:12.080 --> 12:13.920
I feel awful.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.500
Me too.
(SIGHS)

12:16.330 --> 12:17.750
What...

12:17.750 --> 12:19.380
What?
You said no backsies.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.830
♪ Go to sleep
my sweet baby boy

12:27.830 --> 12:32.080
♪ Chase a squirrel
their nature's chew toy ♪

12:32.080 --> 12:33.170
Goodnight, Chuck.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.080
(GASPS)

12:40.080 --> 12:43.790
Hey, we're sleeping here.
People are so rude,
aren't they, Chuck?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.210
Chuck?
Chuck, where are you?

12:48.420 --> 12:50.170
Chuck! Chuck!

12:56.750 --> 12:58.210
Chuck ran away!

12:58.210 --> 13:00.790
Oh, no!
You must be so worried.

13:00.790 --> 13:03.580
Especially with that
mountain lion out there.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.500
It's all your guys fault!

13:05.500 --> 13:06.920
How is it our fault?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.290
Because Chuck knew
you didn't like him.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.880
Oh, come on.

13:10.880 --> 13:15.170
Jorge knows how
we feel about him
and he hasn't run away.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.210
Probably because
it involves running.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.290
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:19.290 --> 13:20.710
I'm going to
look for Chuck.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.330
Maybe he'll come if he
smells his favorite chew toy.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.120
And there goes my last shoe.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.290
Jorge, may I have
a word with you?

13:34.290 --> 13:38.290
Well, if isn't
Benedict Armstrong.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.540
Uh, I think you mean
Benedict Arnold.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.080
The notorious traitor.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.460
No, Benedict Armstrong,
the biggest jerk at my school.

13:46.460 --> 13:50.210
One time, he made me
eat my own sock.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.960
Why did you not tell
the principal?

13:51.960 --> 13:53.460
He was the principal.

13:55.380 --> 13:58.120
Moving on.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.250
I want to apologize
for telling Griff
to lose on purpose.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.750
I was only trying to help you
get your name on a plaque.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.120
Ravi, I want to earn
that plaque.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.250
I mean, how would you feel
if some girl only dated you
out of pity?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.210
Grateful.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.250
(SIGHS) But I do see
what you're saying.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.210
Look, if I don't beat
Griff fair and square.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.040
That plaque would
just be a giant lie.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.330
Like the moon landing.

14:21.330 --> 14:25.210
Okay, you've got to transfer
to a different school.

14:25.210 --> 14:28.080
So, if Griff agrees
to try his hardest.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.210
Will you play
for the record?

14:29.210 --> 14:31.460
Of course.
That's all I wanted.

14:31.460 --> 14:34.420
Great, and good thing
'cause you're terrible
at darts.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.920
Chuck, here boy!

14:41.920 --> 14:44.290
Lou! There you are.

14:44.290 --> 14:47.330
Ow, ow, ow.
My feet are killing me.

14:47.330 --> 14:50.540
Turns out, shoes have
other uses besides
making people jealous.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.580
What are you guys doing here?

14:53.580 --> 14:56.420
Is my dog not allowed
in the woods either?

14:56.420 --> 15:00.120
We came to help.
We know how much
Chuck means to you.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.210
Yeah, just because
we don't want Chuck
living with us,

15:02.210 --> 15:04.330
doesn't mean
we want anything bad
to happen to him.

15:04.330 --> 15:07.540
I just came to watch
Emma walk through
the forest barefoot.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.330
(LAUGHS) Your foot's
bleeding again.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.540
Thanks for coming
to help me, guys.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.250
(WOLVES HOWLING IN DISTANCE)

15:15.250 --> 15:17.500
Oh, no!
That sounds like wolves.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.380
They probably smell
the fresh blood
from Emma's feet.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.380
Let's run.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.880
I'm not leaving Chuck out here
especially if there are
dangerous wild animals around.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.380
(SIGHS)
If Lou is staying
then I am too.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.920
Because she's my bestie.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.620
And she's the only one
strong enough to carry me
back to camp.

15:32.620 --> 15:36.040
(CHUCK BARKS)
Chuck, you're safe.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.080
Thank goodness
we found you before
those wolves did.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
(HOWLING)

15:41.080 --> 15:43.710
Wow, that was an amazing
impression of a wolf.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.250
Now do Christopher Walken.

15:46.790 --> 15:50.170
Um, Lou, I don't think
that was an impression.

15:50.170 --> 15:51.710
Wait a minute.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.920
I think Chuck may
actually be a wolf.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.620
Oh, so that's why
he kept destroying
our cabin.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.290
Even after Lou
tried to train him.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.960
And when we played
fetch with a stick,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.290
he came back with
a slightly punctured rabbit.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.710
Best dinner we had
all summer.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.210
(WOLVES HOWLING)

16:08.210 --> 16:09.750
Oh, Chuck,

16:10.420 --> 16:11.830
are those your peeps?

16:11.830 --> 16:14.170
Maybe he picked up
their scent last night

16:14.170 --> 16:16.210
and ran off
to try to find them.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.960
Is that true?

16:17.960 --> 16:19.710
Did you miss your family?

16:21.460 --> 16:24.210
Wolves are
wild animals, Lou.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.000
They need to be
with their pack.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.120
(CHUCK WHINING)
I understand.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.250
I know this is really
hard for you, Lou.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.000
It is.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.040
But...

16:35.040 --> 16:37.620
I guess since
Chuck and his family
found each other,

16:38.880 --> 16:40.380
they should be together.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.250
Take care of yourself,
little buddy.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.460
(WHINES)
Look.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.290
(BARKING)

16:54.290 --> 16:55.330
Chuck.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.120
Oh, I'll miss you too.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.380
Goodbye, Chuck.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.540
Don't worry about me.

17:06.540 --> 17:07.920
(VOICE BREAKING)
I'll be fine.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.580
Wow, that is quite
the dynamic warm-up routine

17:16.580 --> 17:18.250
for a bean bag
throwing game.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.460
No, dude, a bug
flew up my boxers.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.330
That had to
have been horrible.

17:23.330 --> 17:25.500
Actually,
it just tickled.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.210
I was talking to the bug.

17:28.170 --> 17:29.960
Anyway...

17:29.960 --> 17:33.540
Are you ready to take on Griff
and etch your name
in the camp record books?

17:33.540 --> 17:37.580
Yup, you're looking at
camp Kikiwaka's
new boss of toss.

17:37.580 --> 17:38.580
Oh.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.460
(CHEERING)

17:42.460 --> 17:44.620
Let's see Griff
beat that.

Guess who picked up
a new sponsor.

bail bonds 'n
corn dogs"?

18:03.580 --> 18:07.460
Yeah, if you get
arrested five times,
lunch is on them.

18:08.330 --> 18:10.210
Okay.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.750
Griff is blue,
Jorge is red.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.330
First one to 21 wins.

18:15.330 --> 18:19.080
I'm just gonna warm-up
my bag tossing wrists.
(KNUCKLES CRACKING)

18:19.080 --> 18:20.210

18:23.170 --> 18:25.790
I need to warm-up too.
Ravi.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.420
(ALL CHEERING)

19:07.960 --> 19:10.880
Okay, Jorge,
you and Griff are tied.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.380
The next bag
in the hole wins.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.170
You are one toss away
from owning that record.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.420
But all my bags
are blocking the hole.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.170
This is the hardest shot
in the game.

19:21.170 --> 19:24.170
You can do it, Jorge.
I believe in you.

19:24.170 --> 19:27.080
Thank you, Ravi.
Here goes nothing.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.080
CROWD: Oh!

19:39.960 --> 19:43.330
Yes, you knocked
my bag in. I win.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.880
That was so close.

19:46.290 --> 19:48.710
Congratulations, Griff.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.420
Thanks, dude.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.580
And don't be bummed.

19:52.580 --> 19:55.580
You're the toughest
opponent I've ever faced.

19:55.580 --> 19:59.290
And I once met a guy
who stuffed his bags
with human fingers.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.290
Ooh, he would have
liked these.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.670
Lou, we're really sorry that
you had to let Chuck go.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.960
Thank you, Tiffany,

20:15.960 --> 20:18.170
but I'm the one
who should be sorry.

20:18.170 --> 20:21.960
I can't believe
I had a wild, albeit
incredibly cute, animal

20:21.960 --> 20:26.040
living in our cabin
and blamed you guys
when he ran away.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.960
I'm the worst
Woodchuck ever.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.120
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.880
Zuri's way worse than you.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.960
Agreed.
No argument here.

20:36.790 --> 20:38.290
Just remember, Lou,

20:38.290 --> 20:40.040
Chuck might be off
with his pack

20:40.040 --> 20:42.710
but you've still got
your pack right here.

20:42.710 --> 20:43.790
Thanks, guys.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.380
(SCRATCHING ON DOOR)

20:47.380 --> 20:50.330
Oh! Is Jorge scratching
his butt on our door again?

20:50.330 --> 20:52.170
Jorge, we've told you...

20:52.170 --> 20:55.040
Oh, Lou, it's for you.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.040
Chuck.

20:58.330 --> 21:01.000
What are you doing here?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.620
Oh, no he's gonna
poop on my pillow.

21:05.210 --> 21:07.330
Aw, he must
have missed you.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.170
Not as much as
I missed him.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.920
But I'm sorry, buddy.
You can't stay here.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.330
You weren't the most
considerate roommate.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.670
Their words, not mine.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.750
OMG!

21:23.750 --> 21:27.210
I just had an idea how Chuck
can live with his family
but still visit us.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.080
I hope it involves
doggy diapers.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.920
I love it.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.460
Now Chuck has his
own Woodchuck cabin.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.210
So he can come and go
as he pleases.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.080
I even put in
Violet's old case.
As a toilet.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.380
And here's
a dog house
warming gift.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.500
Please chew on this
instead of me.

21:45.580 --> 21:47.170
Wow, thanks, guys.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.250
Chuck says thank you too.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.670
Okay, boy, let's check out
your new house.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.080
Timmy?
Woof.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.250
Oh, nice try, Timmy,
but you know
that's not your house.

22:02.670 --> 22:05.540
I know but
couldn't we share?

22:05.540 --> 22:09.120
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does that say Timmy?

22:11.170 --> 22:12.620
Back to the woods.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.790
I really hope
you don't catch fleas
from that kid.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.040
Jorge, there's something
in the mess hall
you need to see.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.040
I've already seen
the two-headed rat.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.750
I named the left head Nibbles.

22:34.210 --> 22:35.830
Jorge Ramirez.

22:35.830 --> 22:39.250
We are here to present
you with this plaque
for the beanbag toss.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.080
But I didn't win.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.080
True, but you
tied the record.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.580
I also got Moose rump
bail bonds 'n corn dogs

22:49.580 --> 22:52.000
to give you a coupon
for a free drink
with your first felony.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.960
Guys, this is so cool.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.500
But I can't accept.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.210
BOTH: What?

23:01.210 --> 23:05.580
I mean,
I just started playing
and I almost beat Griff.

23:05.580 --> 23:08.880
Maybe with some practice
I can set a new camp record

23:08.880 --> 23:10.960
and really earn
my own plaque.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.080
I bet you could.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.170
And I'd be happy to
give you some tips

23:15.170 --> 23:18.460
from a guy, the good folks of
Beanbag magazine called

23:18.460 --> 23:20.750
"Best in throw."

23:20.750 --> 23:22.080
You're on.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.790
And how about
you get me a date

23:23.790 --> 23:26.420
with one of those
wrist massage girls?

23:26.420 --> 23:28.790
Dude, I'm a beanbag champ.

23:28.790 --> 23:30.170
Not a miracle worker.
