WEBVTT

02:15.669 --> 02:18.372
NEW YORK IS PLACE
WHERE PEOPLE COME

02:18.406 --> 02:20.374
TO HAVE
THEIR DREAMS REALIZED.

02:20.408 --> 02:23.377
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE

02:23.411 --> 02:26.214
NOT ONLY COME
TO THIS CITY,

02:26.247 --> 02:28.482
BUT, ULTIMATELY,
MAKE THEIR WAY TO TIFFANY.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.384
DO I KNOW HOW TO GIVE
GOOD FUCKING BITES,

02:30.418 --> 02:31.819
OR WHAT, PEOPLE?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.400
LOOK, JUST ROLL AWAY
AND THEN I'LL BABBLE ON.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.791
TELL ME WHEN IT'S BORING.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.569
WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN
A COMPANY LIKE TIFFANY

02:39.593 --> 02:41.229
WHICH IS VERY OLD,
YOU KNOW,

02:41.262 --> 02:42.406
THERE'S A LOT
OF CONTEXT TO IT.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.897
I'M NOT UNINTERESTED IN IT.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.234
DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE BRANDS?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.301
NO.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
I CALLED UP MY MANAGER

02:48.736 --> 02:51.405
AND I SAID, "I HAVE TO PAY
MY JEWELRY BILL."

02:51.439 --> 02:53.441
I SAID, "ANY MOVIE
THAT COMES DOWN THE PIKE,

02:53.474 --> 02:55.509
ANY HORRIBLE
PIECE OF CRAP."

02:55.543 --> 02:57.445
SO I DID
THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE...

02:57.478 --> 03:00.248
THERE ARE FEW AMERICAN
RETAIL OUTLETS

03:00.281 --> 03:02.816
THAT ARE TRUE INSTITUTIONS.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.218

05:09.577 --> 05:11.812

05:13.647 --> 05:16.450
THE BRANDING, THAT BLUE BOX
WITH THE WHITE RIBBON,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.885
IS UNEQUIVOCAL.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.887
IF YOU SEE THAT BOX
UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.889
IF YOU SEE THAT BOX
ON A BIRTHDAY,

05:21.922 --> 05:23.391
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING

05:23.424 --> 05:24.892
REALLY, REALLY SPECIAL.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.594
AND THAT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.962
THAT IS A LOT OF VERY,
VERY CLEVER PEOPLE

05:28.996 --> 05:31.399
SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME AND ENERGY

05:31.432 --> 05:33.401
THINKING ABOUT
THIS BRAND POSITIONING.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.578
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA SIT
IN RELATION

05:34.602 --> 05:35.736
TO THEIR COMPETITORS,

05:35.769 --> 05:37.738
AND EXACTLY WHERE
THEY WANT TO BE.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.774
IT'S OUR MOST RECOGNIZABLE
BRAND QUALITY

05:40.808 --> 05:42.643
AND THEREFORE,
IT HAS TO BE PERFECT

05:42.676 --> 05:43.977
AND IT HAS TO BE RIGHT.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.580
PEOPLE HAVE A BIG AFFINITY
WITH THAT COLOR.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.450
I THINK IT'S SUCH
A RECOGNIZABLE BRAND COLOR

05:49.483 --> 05:53.754
THAT, OF COURSE,
PEOPLE HAVE VERY POSITIVE
ASSOCIATIONS WITH IT.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.756
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
GONNA TAKE IT ALL AWAY.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.101
'CAUSE THAT WAY, YOU'LL JUST
REALLY LEARN THE LESSON, OKAY?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.860
ALL RIGHTY.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.762
WELL, I'M GONNA RUN
A COUPLE OF ERRANDS

06:01.795 --> 06:03.130
AND I WILL SEE YOU
AT DINNER.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.603
SHE TOOK ALL MY STUFF.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.104
YEAH...

06:11.138 --> 06:13.674
EVERYTHING BUT
THE LITTLE BLUE ONE.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.843
THAT'S THE BEST ONE.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.646
OH, MY GOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.980
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

06:20.013 --> 06:21.982
MANY OF THOSE
LITTLE BLUE BOXES.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.585
SO, YES, AS A WOMAN
I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND

06:24.618 --> 06:26.787
THE ADDICTION TO THOSE
LITTLE BLUE BOXES.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.989
IT HAPPENS TO BE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COLOR.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.959
THE TIFFANY BLUE
IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL

06:31.992 --> 06:34.061
A "ROBIN'S EGG BLUE."

06:34.094 --> 06:35.629
IT'S A SOPHISTICATED COLOR

06:35.663 --> 06:37.765
BUT IT HAS
SOME GREEN UNDERTONE.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.808
OBVIOUSLY,
WORKING FOR TIFFANY,

06:38.832 --> 06:40.100
WE USE IT
DAY IN, DAY OUT.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.102
WE APPLY IT
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

06:42.135 --> 06:45.539
AND I THINK WE REALLY TRY
TO GET THAT RIGHT,

06:45.573 --> 06:47.207
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
COLOR TO MIX,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.777
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT COLOR
FROM A PRODUCTION STANDPOINT

06:49.810 --> 06:50.844
TO GET RIGHT.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.680
IT CHANGES
DEPENDING UPON

06:52.713 --> 06:54.047
WHETHER
IT'S A PAINTED SURFACE,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.683
A PRINTED FABRIC SURFACE,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.451
A SPRAYED FINISH.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.919
THE NUMBER OF TIFFANY BLUE

06:58.952 --> 07:00.554
IS 1837.

07:00.588 --> 07:04.658
AND THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY
REQUESTED BY TIFFANY

07:04.692 --> 07:07.194
AS THE TIME WHEN TIFFANY
FIRST STARTED.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.864
THE TIFFANY BLUE FORMULA
IS A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET

07:10.898 --> 07:14.001
THAT PANTONE HAS DEVELOPED
SPECIFICALLY FOR TIFFANY,

07:14.034 --> 07:17.037
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT IS ONLY SENT OUT

07:17.070 --> 07:19.773
BY TIFFANY
TO THEIR PRIVILEGED PARTNERS.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.142
PEOPLE ARE TRADE MARKING
DUMB STUFF THESE DAYS

07:22.175 --> 07:24.177
BUT AN INSTITUTION
LIKE TIFFANY'S

07:24.211 --> 07:27.615
DESERVES TO OWN
THAT COLOR BLUE.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.182
THEY MADE THAT BLUE.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.619
THAT BLUE WAS NOTHING
UNTIL TIFFANY'S CAME ALONG.

07:31.652 --> 07:36.690
WHEN TIFFANY WANTED TO CREATE
THIS IMAGE AND CONSISTENCY

07:36.724 --> 07:38.859
WITH ALL THEIR PACKAGING
AND MEDIA,

07:38.892 --> 07:41.962
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD
TO INFUSE THAT COLOR

07:41.995 --> 07:45.032
WITH SOME OF THE SAME
STRONG PIGMENTS,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.767
AND CONSISTENT PIGMENTS,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.937
INTO THAT COLOR
TO ALLOW CONSISTENCY.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.204
OTHERWISE, IT'LL FADE.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.874
COLOR IS SYNONYMOUS
WITH THE BRAND.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.743
SO WE'RE SEEING THIS
MORE AND MORE.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.878
EVEN CELEBRITIES TODAY

07:57.911 --> 07:59.813
ARE BRANDING THEMSELVES

07:59.847 --> 08:02.750
WITH, UH, WE PRODUCED
A COLOR FOR JAY-Z.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.685
HE HAS HIS OWN SIGNATURE BLUE.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.887
BUT KANYE WEST
HAD COME TO US...

08:06.920 --> 08:09.189
I DON'T KNOW, WE GOT...
WE GOT INTO THE RAP WORLD.

♪ THAT SHIT CRAY

08:13.594 --> 08:14.928
I'M NOT TALKIN'
ABOUT "RICH,"

08:14.962 --> 08:17.631
I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT "WEALTH," OKAY?

08:17.665 --> 08:19.066
I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT THE WHITE FAMILY

08:19.099 --> 08:21.068
THAT OWNS
ALL THE FUCKIN' SIMILAC,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.070
THOSE RICH MOTHERFUCKERS,
OKAY?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.772
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
THE WHITE FAMILY

08:24.805 --> 08:26.306
THAT OWNS THE COLOR BLUE.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.709
THOSE RICH BASTARDS,
OKAY?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.244
NO CHOICE OF COLOR
HAS EVER BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL

08:31.278 --> 08:32.946
IN THE HISTORY OF MARKETING.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.082
IN 1853,
THE EMPRESS EUGENIE

08:35.115 --> 08:37.751
WAS THE GREATEST FASHION ICON
OF HER PERIOD.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.120
SHE WAS OUR KIND
OF 19TH-CENTURY GRACE KELLY.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.591
AND, AS EMPRESS OF FRANCE,
SHE CHOSE AN OFFICIAL COLOR,

08:43.624 --> 08:46.026
THIS ROBIN'S EGG,
PALE TURQUOISE BLUE,

08:46.059 --> 08:47.761
AS HER OFFICIAL COLOR

08:47.795 --> 08:49.763
SINCE WHATEVER
THE EMPRESS EUGENIE DID

08:49.797 --> 08:51.765
WAS GOING TO BE
A WORLDWIDE SUCCESS

08:51.799 --> 08:53.266
AND FOLLOWED BY EVERYBODY.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.002
AND THAT BLUE
WAS GOING TO BECOME

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
THE WORLD'S
NUMBER ONE COLOR.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.707
MR. TIFFANY BRILLIANTLY
JUMPED ON THE OPPORTUNITY

08:59.740 --> 09:02.643
AND IMMEDIATELY MADE IT
TIFFANY'S OFFICIAL COLOR.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.945
TIFFANY BLUE
IS SUCH A WELL-KNOWN COLOR.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.615
I ACTUALLY GOT
THE PANTONE SWATCHES

09:07.648 --> 09:09.650
AND HAD A FABRIC
MATCHED TO IT.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.619
I KEPT TRYING TO SAY,
"I WANT THIS BLUE,

09:11.652 --> 09:14.321
I WANT THIS LIGHT BLUE,
IT'S ALL ABOUT A LIGHT BLUE."

09:14.354 --> 09:17.124
AND THEY KEPT COMING BACK
WITH A ROBIN'S EGG.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.959
AND I KEPT SAYING,
"NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.293
TIFFANY BLUE.
TIFFANY BLUE."

09:20.327 --> 09:22.229
AND THEN,
I FINALLY HAD TO GO

09:22.262 --> 09:25.633
AND WE DIP DYED, UM,
FABRIC AND A DRESS TO MATCH.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.143
AND YOU'LL BE SEEING IT

IT'S FUN, BUT IT'S...
IT IS INTENSE

10:11.044 --> 10:14.314
BECAUSE IT'S NOT... IT'S NOT
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY, YOU KNOW?

10:14.347 --> 10:15.949
- RIGHT.
- YOU'RE PRESENTING YOURSELF

10:15.983 --> 10:17.317
- IN A PARTICULAR WAY
- RIGHT.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.786
- BECAUSE IT'S MY BUSINESS.
- RIGHT.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.353
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS 19...

10:20.387 --> 10:22.189
NOT WEARING HIGH HEEL
FLIP FLOPS ANYMORE.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.857
RIGHT, NO MORE
HIGH HEEL FLIP FLOPS

10:23.891 --> 10:26.359
- AND TAN LINES AND CROP TOPS.
- RIGHT.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.228
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.297
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.199
THIS IS NO EVENT
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

10:32.232 --> 10:33.867
AS IMPORTANT AS THE OSCARS

10:33.901 --> 10:35.936
IN TERMS OF CELEBRITY
PRODUCT PLACEMENT.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.871
EVERYONE SEES IT.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.208
AND... AND WHEN
I DO MAGAZINES

10:41.241 --> 10:43.443
OR ADVERTISING,
MY MOM SEES IT,

10:43.476 --> 10:45.913
AND MY FRIENDS SEE IT,
MY PEERS SEE IT.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.916
BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAS
THIS SORT OF, LIKE, BROAD REACH.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.052
JEWELRY ON THE RED CARPET
IS A VERY COMPLICATED GAME.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.054
I THINK IT'S BIG
BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPETITIVE,

10:54.087 --> 10:55.823
IT'S SO VALUABLE
FOR BRANDS.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.090
IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH EVERYBODY.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.427
I MEAN, I HAVE
A HANDFUL OF JEWELERS

11:00.460 --> 11:02.963
THAT I WORK WITH
FOR A RED CARPET DRESSING.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.432
AND I'VE HAD
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.134
I'VE HAD A RELATIONSHIP
WITH TIFFANY

11:07.167 --> 11:08.736
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.804
I'VE HAD TREMENDOUS
SUCCESS WITH THEM...

11:10.838 --> 11:11.948
JEWELRY, THERE'S
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

11:11.972 --> 11:13.974
OF PAYOLA,
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.

11:14.007 --> 11:18.111
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL
FOR JEWELERS

11:18.145 --> 11:20.413
TO BE COURTING THE TALENT

11:20.447 --> 11:22.950
WITH CHECKS.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.460
THE STAKES ARE HIGH
AND THE PAYOFF IS GREAT.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.920
THE BRANDS WANT
THAT POSITIONING,

11:26.954 --> 11:29.089
AND THE ACTRESSES ALSO WANT
THAT EXCLUSIVITY

11:29.122 --> 11:31.424
OF BEING THE ONLY GIRL
IN THE BEST DRESS.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.127
THE ONLY GIRL
WITH THE BEST NECKLACE.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.296
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S SO GORGEOUS.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.231
YEAH, HAVE A LOOK.
PASS THE MIRROR

11:38.265 --> 11:41.234
AND LOOK AT THAT 'CAUSE
THAT'S REALLY FABULOUS.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.104
- YOU SEE?
- YES, I CAN.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.975
- IT IS SO CRAZY.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HOW DOES IT FEEL ON?

11:48.008 --> 11:51.444
-IT FEELS... PERFECT.
-I MEAN, IT FEELS
AMAZING, DOESN'T IT?

11:51.478 --> 11:54.114
AND JUST THE WAY IT SITS
AND THE WAY IT MOVES.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.516
- IT'S... AMAZING.
- IT'S GORGEOUS.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.251
WOW.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.387
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE OSCARS
IS ALL OF A SUDDEN

12:00.420 --> 12:03.156
THESE EXCITING PIECES
THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,

12:03.190 --> 12:05.492
YOU KNOW, MAGICALLY APPEAR
'CAUSE I THINK THEY...

12:05.525 --> 12:07.360
EVERYONE KEEPS
LIKE, A LITTLE...

12:07.394 --> 12:11.098
THEIR LITTLE SPECIAL STASH
FOR THAT TIME OF YEAR.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.169
GORGEOUS.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.971
- ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT?
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.973
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.174
WHAT KIND OF STONE IS THAT?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.509
THAT'S AN AQUAMARINE.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.511
- SO BEAUTIFUL.
- MY BIRTHSTONE.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.179
- IS IT?
- WOW.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.215
SEE, I KNEW THIS WAS...

12:28.248 --> 12:29.492
I WAS KINDRED SPIRITS
WITH THIS JEWEL.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.151
YOU KNEW
YOU COULD FEEL IT.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.253
- IT WAS CALLING YOU.
- GOD, I LOVE THIS.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.554
SO, JESSICA'S AMAZING.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.158
SHE HAS THAT MIXTURE
OF... OF GLAMOUR,

12:38.191 --> 12:39.559
WHICH CAN GO BACK
TO ANOTHER TIME,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.829
BUT SHE'S ALSO
VERY CONTEMPORARY.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.564
THIS IS WHERE I, SORT OF,
PUT ALL MY DESIGNS UP

12:44.597 --> 12:46.499
AND THIS SORT OF GIVES
A GOOD IDEA

12:46.533 --> 12:48.969
OF THE OVERALL FEELING
OF WHERE WE'RE GOING

12:49.002 --> 12:50.170
AS A DESIGN TEAM.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
AND THIS IS
THE INITIAL DRAWING

12:52.205 --> 12:53.841
FOR YOUR NECKLACE
THAT YOU HAVE ON.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.175
IT'S ALREADY YOURS.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.409
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DOING

12:56.443 --> 12:58.578
THESE FABULOUS EARRINGS,
DROP EARRINGS,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.347
AND A BRACELET
WITH TASSELS

13:00.380 --> 13:03.450
THAT, AGAIN, WILL HAVE
THAT FLUID FEELING.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.118
WE DID A LOT OF WREATHS
IN THE PAST,

13:05.152 --> 13:06.453
BUT THE BEAUTY
ABOUT THIS PIECE

13:06.486 --> 13:08.188
IS THAT THERE ARE
PEAR-SHAPED DIAMONDS

13:08.221 --> 13:10.223
GOING IN ONE DIRECTION.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.860
IT'S HAVING A PRESENCE,
AND IT'S HAVING A PRESENCE

13:12.893 --> 13:15.595
ON SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,
AS GORGEOUS AS HER.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.297
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
AROUND "BLUE BOOK."

13:17.330 --> 13:19.199
ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE
WILL COME TO "BLUE BOOK"

13:19.232 --> 13:20.576
AND THEY WILL SEE
SOME OF THE PIECES

13:20.600 --> 13:22.369
THAT SHE WORE AT THE OSCARS.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.838
IT ADDS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF VALUE.

IN THE MAIL

14:01.909 --> 14:03.476

14:03.510 --> 14:06.146

14:08.615 --> 14:11.451
AND... AND LOOK FORWARD
TO "BLUE BOOK" ALL YEAR.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.253
"BLUE BOOK"
IS ABOUT STONES.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.389
IT'S ABOUT FINDING
THE MOST PHENOMENAL STONES.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.659
SOME OF THE PIECES
ARE JUST GONNA BE SO STUNNING

14:19.692 --> 14:21.494
AND SO SEDUCTIVE,

14:21.528 --> 14:25.432
I'M HOPING THAT I WILL
FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THEM

14:25.465 --> 14:29.069

15:02.669 --> 15:04.537

15:04.571 --> 15:06.974
I RARELY HAVE TIME
FOR THE CATHARTIC

15:07.007 --> 15:08.275
RETAIL EXPERIENCE.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.943
BUT THEY DO KNOW
ABOUT TIFFANY'S.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.479
THOSE WONDERFUL, BLUE BOOKS
THAT ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE

15:12.512 --> 15:13.689
AND THEY SEE MOMMY
LOOKING AT THE JEWELRY,

15:13.713 --> 15:15.282
AND I SHOW THEM
THE JEWELRY.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.550
AND, IN FACT,
THIS PAST VALENTINE'S DAY,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.328
ONE OF MY TWIN DAUGHTERS
CAME UP TO ME AND SAID,

15:19.352 --> 15:21.354
"MOMMY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM TIFFANY'S

15:21.388 --> 15:23.356
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY?
I'LL TELL DADDY."

15:23.390 --> 15:24.992
AND... AND IT WAS
VERY CUTE.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.659
SHE TOLD HIM I WANTED
THE LOVE RING,

15:26.693 --> 15:28.661
ONLY MY HUSBAND
ENDED UP BUYING

15:28.695 --> 15:30.163
THE ELSA PERETTI LOVE RING

15:30.197 --> 15:31.437
AND I WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT

15:31.464 --> 15:33.100
THE PALOMA PICASSO
LOVE RING.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.968
AND SO, I WAS
VERY FORTUNATE.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.269
AT THE END,
I GOT BOTH RINGS

15:36.303 --> 15:38.005
BECAUSE BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS

15:38.038 --> 15:41.074
WANTED TO BE REPRESENTED
IN THIS VALENTINE'S MOMENT.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.644
WITH A SENSE OF FANTASY
AND LUXURY AND IMAGINATION.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.680
I HAVE A PIN
OF THE, UM, LITTLE BIRD

15:47.714 --> 15:50.217
STANDING ON... SITTING ON
A STONE, WHICH I LOVE.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.195
EVERY TIME I WEAR IT,
PEOPLE GO, "OH, MY GOODNESS.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.989
THAT'S AMAZING.
IT'S A REMARKABLE PIECE."

15:56.023 --> 15:58.691
I'M WEARING THIS RING NOW
THAT HAD BEEN MY GRANDMOTHER'S

15:58.725 --> 16:00.293
THAT, I THINK, IS FROM...

16:00.327 --> 16:02.095
IT'S PALOMA PICASSO
WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.364
I THINK FROM
MID-SEVENTIES.

16:04.397 --> 16:08.235
IT'S TWO STONES.
IT'S A, UM, AN AMETHYST

16:08.268 --> 16:10.137
AND I THINK
IT'S AN AQUAMARINE,

16:10.170 --> 16:11.504
BUT IT MIGHT BE
A BLUE TOPAZ.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.106
MY GRANDMOTHER
GAVE IT TO ME.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.042
SHE OFTEN WOULD, YOU KNOW,
GIVE YOU A PIECE

16:15.075 --> 16:16.776
HERE OR THERE,
AND THIS SHE GAVE ME.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.245
HI... OH!

16:18.278 --> 16:21.048
- OH, NO!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
FLUFFY... OH, SORRY.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.788
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT'S MY DAUGHTER.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.590
ARE YOU WEARING
ANYTHING TIFFANY?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.160
UH, NO, I'M NOT.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.062
SHE HAS, THOUGH.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.439
YEAH, SHE'S NEXT IN LINE
FOR EVERYTHING.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.031
EITHER SERENA OR FLUFFY,

16:38.065 --> 16:39.732
AND I DON'T THINK
FLUFFY WANTS IT, SO...

16:41.368 --> 16:44.104
OH, HE CAN COME HERE.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.097
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
HE CAN COME IN.
COME IN, COME HERE.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.078
- WOW, LOOK AT THAT.
- BIG BABY.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.580
SO FRANCESCA'S
BLUE BOOK THEME IS "WATER,"

16:53.613 --> 16:56.049
- DID YOU KNOW THAT?
- I DID HEAR IT, YEAH.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.460
- YOU DID HEAR THAT?
- I DID HEAR THAT, YEAH.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.586
SHE CAN BE QUITE
SECRETIVE, FRANCESCA.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.589
SHE DEFINITELY CAN
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN A THING.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.124
IT'S MORE THAT SHE'S,
I THINK,

17:04.156 --> 17:06.126
FOCUSED ON SOMETHING
AND MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

17:06.159 --> 17:09.462
NOT READY TO SORT OF PULL
IT OUT AND BEAR IT JUST YET

17:09.496 --> 17:13.066
FOR ME TO GO, "UGH,"
OR ME TO GO, "WOW."

17:13.099 --> 17:14.443
OR ME TO GO,
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?"

17:14.467 --> 17:16.136
OR, YOU KNOW,
OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.771
BUT I DO REMEMBER
SORT OF HEARING WHISPERS

17:18.805 --> 17:21.741
THAT THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES
THAT SHE WAS GONNA GET THIS JOB

17:21.773 --> 17:25.278
AT TIFFANY, AND IT WAS ONE
OF THOSE ONES WHERE SUDDENLY

17:25.311 --> 17:27.814
IT JUST FELT ALL THE STARS
HAD ALIGNED IN THE RIGHT PLACE

17:27.847 --> 17:30.250
AND FRANCESCA WAS RIGHT
IN THE EPICENTER.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.620
IT FELT RIGHT, IT FELT LIKE
SHE HAD EARNED IT

17:33.653 --> 17:36.623
BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN
DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.392
I THINK THERE'S
TWO THINGS THAT HELP ME.
ONE, I'M A WOMAN.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.461
SURPRISINGLY, THE FIRST
DESIGN DIRECTOR

17:41.494 --> 17:43.296
FOR TIFFANY
THAT'S A WOMAN.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.797
AND IT'S KINDA GREAT

17:44.831 --> 17:46.633
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I TRY THE JEWELRY ON

17:46.666 --> 17:48.635
AND I WEAR IT,
AND I FEEL IT.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.503
I HAVE TO, I MEAN,
I WANT TO.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.106
IF I DON'T WEAR IT,
I CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS ON IT.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.308
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS
TO SIT ON THE BODY.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.643
I HAVE TO WEAR IT.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.478
AND THEN, SECONDLY,
IS THE FACT

17:58.511 --> 17:59.879
THAT I'M... I'M A TRAINED
JEWELER.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.149
SO I'M GONNA THINK
ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.351
IT'S JUST
RIDICULOUSLY PERFECT

18:04.384 --> 18:06.153
THAT SHE LOOKS
LIKE AUDREY HEPBURN,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.321
AND SHE'S DESIGNING
FOR TIFFANY.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.299
THE WAY THAT I DESIGN

18:19.332 --> 18:21.368
IS I REALLY START
WITH A CONCEPT.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.504
AND THEN, FROM THE CONCEPT,
I CREATE A STORY.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.507
WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
"BLUE BOOK," YOU KNOW,

18:27.540 --> 18:31.244
YOU'D SORT OF FEEL
VERY HAPPY IN HERE,
"AREN'T THESE FUN?

18:31.278 --> 18:32.921
"AREN'T THESE GREAT?
OH, THESE ARE A BIT UNUSUAL."

18:32.945 --> 18:35.182
AND I THINK HERE YOU HAVE
AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE

18:35.215 --> 18:37.317
THAT THEN LEADS YOU
ONTO HERE.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.686
WE'VE OBVIOUSLY PUSHED
THE BOUNDARIES THIS YEAR.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.388
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT
GOING TO BE

18:41.421 --> 18:43.490
YOUR EVERYDAY "BLUE BOOK."

18:43.523 --> 18:44.924
IT DOES HAVE
CLASSICAL PIECES,

18:44.957 --> 18:47.527
BUT IT ALSO HAS
SOME VERY UNUSUAL PIECES.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.163
WHICH, I THINK, IS WHY
WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.200
THERE'S TWO THINGS
THAT I'M THINKING WHILE
I'M DOING THAT...

18:53.233 --> 18:55.768
SO ONE IS THE LOOK
AND FEEL OF IT,

18:55.802 --> 18:57.870
AND THE OTHER THING
WAS JUST TO FRAGMENT IT

18:57.904 --> 18:59.906
INTO, YOU KNOW, ICE,

18:59.939 --> 19:03.310
SNOW, DEW DROPS,

19:03.343 --> 19:04.911
TO CREATE THESE...

19:04.944 --> 19:07.180
THESE DIFFERENT SUBTHEMES,
IN A WAY.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.416
AND THEN HOW THEY'RE GONNA
RHYTHMICALLY SIT

19:09.449 --> 19:10.950
ONE NEXT TO THE OTHER.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.553
YOU CAN APPROACH IT WITH,
YOU KNOW, COLORED STONES.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.288
YOU CAN APPROACH IT
THROUGH DIAMONDS.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.924
YOU CAN APPROACH IT
THROUGH SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.741
HERE WE HAVE ABOUT...

19:34.774 --> 19:37.410
I'D SAY OVER $20 MILLION
WORTH OF DIAMONDS.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.412
SO, THESE ARE ALL
FANCY COLORS.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.548
SO WE'VE GOT A BIT
TO PLAY AROUND WITH TODAY.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.251
THAT ONE... SO THIS
IS A SORT OF...

19:44.284 --> 19:47.220
BEAUTIFUL.
THIS IS LIKE RAIN.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.489
- NICE SPLASHES OF RAIN.
- IT'S WONDERFUL.

19:49.522 --> 19:54.594
BUT WE DON'T WANNA GO DOWN
THE ROUTE OF FOUNTAINS
AND SHOWERS, YOU KNOW?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.929
WE WANT TO KEEP IT
REALLY PURE.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.900
AND THE STYLE HAS TO SIT WELL
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING

20:00.933 --> 20:03.436
WITH WATCHES,
LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.672
AND IT HAS TO ALSO REFLECT
WHAT WE'RE DOING

20:05.705 --> 20:08.408
IN THE FASHION JEWELRY,
SO THAT IT'S ONE VOICE.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.377
IT BECOMES... IT BECOMES A
VOCABULARY,

20:10.410 --> 20:11.787
SO THAT IF YOU'RE WEARING
A TIFFANY WATCH

20:11.811 --> 20:12.945
WITH A TIFFANY NECKLACE,

20:12.979 --> 20:14.581
I KNOW, YOU KNOW?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.616
I CAN SEE IT FROM
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM,

20:16.649 --> 20:17.817
THAT'S TIFFANY.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.852
♪ YOUR LOVE, YOUR LOVE

20:19.886 --> 20:22.689
♪ OUR LOVE

20:24.957 --> 20:29.462
♪ I CAN SEE
MY BABY SWINGING ♪

20:29.496 --> 20:31.631
♪ HIS PARLIAMENT'S

21:03.863 --> 21:04.997
AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU

21:05.031 --> 21:06.999
TO SET THE TIFFANY DIAMOND?

21:07.033 --> 21:11.070
- I THINK ABOUT TWO HOURS.
- TWO HOURS.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.940
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
QUITE A MOMENT.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.083
WELL, IT'S AMAZING
IF YOU THINK

21:15.107 --> 21:17.377
THE HISTORY
THAT STONE HAS.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.911
IT'S QUITE AMAZING.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.356
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.857
LOVE WHAT?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.725
TIFFANY'S.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.437
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

21:44.471 --> 21:45.881
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN,
HOW NOTHING BAD

21:45.905 --> 21:47.874
COULD'VE HAPPENED TO YOU
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.547
IT ISN'T THAT I GIVE A HOOT
ABOUT JEWELRY,

21:49.576 --> 21:51.511
EXCEPT DIAMONDS,
OF COURSE.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.514
LIKE THAT.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.388
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WOMEN
IN THE WORLD

22:01.421 --> 22:03.390
THAT HAVE WORN HER.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.125
UH, IN 1961,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.728
WALTER HOVING,
BEING THE ENTREPRENEUR

22:08.761 --> 22:10.963
AND THE PUBLICIST
THAT HE WAS,

22:10.997 --> 22:14.967
UH... DECIDED TO HAVE
SOME FILM SHOTS TAKEN

22:15.001 --> 22:16.403
HERE AT THE STORE.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.005
AND MS. HEPBURN
WORE THE NECKLACE,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.073
UH, WORE THE DIAMOND
IN A NECKLACE

22:21.107 --> 22:22.975
DESIGNED BY SCHLUMBERGER.

22:23.009 --> 22:27.814
IN ORDER FOR THE PRODUCTION
TO GET ACCESS TO TIFFANY'S,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.850
THEY GRANTED TIFFANY'S
A LITTLE PHOTO SHOOT

22:30.883 --> 22:34.587
WITH AUDREY WEARING
THE TIFFANY DIAMOND NECKLACE.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.756
SO THEY DID A LITTLE BIT
OF A TRADE.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.726
PARAMOUNT GOT
THE STORE AND...

22:39.759 --> 22:42.061
THE COMPANY GOT AUDREY.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.165
SO SHE WAS THE SECOND WOMAN.

22:46.198 --> 22:50.770
THE FIRST WOMAN
WAS A SOCIALITE IN 1957.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.474
TIFFANY AND COMPANY
WAS CO-HOSTING A CHARITY BALL

22:54.507 --> 22:56.609
UP IN NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.

22:56.643 --> 23:00.547
AND THE CO-HOSTESS,
MRS. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE,

23:00.580 --> 23:04.717
WAS ACTUALLY THE VERY FIRST
WOMAN TO EVER WEAR HER.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.460
HE FOUND THE DIAMOND,
THE ROUGH,

23:13.493 --> 23:16.696
IN THE KIMBERLY MINE
IN SOUTH AFRICA.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.699
IT WAS 287-CARATS,
HUGE ROUGH.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.901
AND HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BUY IT.

23:21.934 --> 23:26.706
OF COURSE, ENORMOUS RISK
TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.476
ONE IS NEVER QUITE SURE,
WITH THAT SIZE OF ROUGH,

23:29.509 --> 23:31.511
TRULY WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO GET OUT OF IT.

23:31.544 --> 23:35.014
WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING A ROUGH
TO A SMALLER DIAMOND,

23:35.047 --> 23:38.117
OFTEN MANY OF THE PIECES
YOU'RE CUTTING AWAY

23:38.150 --> 23:41.153
ARE SO INCLUDED
THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY USABLE.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.823
MAYBE SOME
OF THE SMALLER PIECES WERE,

23:43.856 --> 23:46.993
BUT PREDOMINANTLY,
THAT IS ALL WEIGHT LOSS.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.662
SO HE TOOK THE RISK,
HE HAD A SENSE THAT THERE WAS

23:49.696 --> 23:52.599
SOMETHING WITHIN THAT
THAT WAS SPECIAL.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.834
SO HE BOUGHT THE ROUGH.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.936
THE ROUGH WAS SENT OVER
TO EUROPE

23:56.969 --> 23:58.738
AND THE FIRST CUT WAS MADE.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.941
BUT THERE CAME OUT
THE MOST INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT,

24:01.974 --> 24:04.043
BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND
WITH 82 FACETS.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.678
QUITE UNIQUE AT THAT TIME.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.014
DIAMONDS WERE NOT CUT
WITH THAT MANY FACETS.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.618
THE WONDERFUL THING
IS YOU LOOK AT THAT
TIFFANY DIAMOND NOW

24:11.651 --> 24:15.622
AND IT LOOKS AS MODERN
AS IF IT WERE CUT

24:15.655 --> 24:18.024
LAST WEEK, OR A MONTH AGO,
OR A YEAR AGO.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.926
IT'S INCREDIBLY ADVANCED.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.195
SO THAT'S VERY SPECIAL,
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DIAMOND.

24:23.229 --> 24:27.133
THE SECURITY OF HER
IS EXTREMELY TIGHT, OBVIOUSLY.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.869
BUT DURING MY TIME
ON THE MAIN FLOOR,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.904
WE HAD, UH, A PROCEDURE

24:31.938 --> 24:33.840
THAT AFTER THE STORE CLOSED

24:33.873 --> 24:37.109
AND THE STAINLESS
STEEL DOORS WERE LOCKED,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.211
SHE WAS WITHDRAWN
FROM THE VAULT

24:39.245 --> 24:40.747
ON THE MAIN FLOOR.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.715
YOU HAD TO WEAR
THE WHITE GLOVES,

24:42.749 --> 24:44.083
AND SHE WAS PUT
IN HER CARRIAGE

24:44.116 --> 24:46.052
AND WHISKED AWAY
FOR THE NIGHT.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.521
THERE IS A LITTLE SECRET.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.190
ONE NIGHT, WHEN I WAS REMOVING
HER FROM THE CASE,

24:51.223 --> 24:54.193
FOR JUST A MOMENT... I THOUGHT
ABOUT MISS HEPBURN,

24:54.226 --> 24:56.062
I THOUGHT ABOUT
MRS. WHITEHOUSE,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.264
THEY HAD BOTH WORN IT
IN A NECKLACE.

24:58.297 --> 25:01.000
AND I THOUGHT... "A TIARA.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.836
I COULD BE THE FIRST PERSON,
THE FIRST WOMAN,

25:03.870 --> 25:06.973
THE FIRST EMPLOYEE
THAT WORE HER AS A TIARA."

25:07.006 --> 25:09.909
SO, FOR A SECOND,
I PUT HER IN MY QUAFF

25:09.942 --> 25:14.046
AND I STOOD THERE,
AND I WAS ACTUALLY TRANSFORMED.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.282
LIFE IS NOT MEASURED

25:16.315 --> 25:21.253
BY THE NUMBER OF BEATS
THAT YOUR HEART MAKES,

25:21.287 --> 25:22.955
LIFE IS TRULY MEASURED

25:22.989 --> 25:26.292
BY THE MOMENTS
THAT TAKE OUR BREATH WAY.

25:26.325 --> 25:30.262
- AND THAT MOMENT I WILL NEVER FORGET.
- -IT TRULY DID?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.965
OH, IT DID.
I WAS BREATHLESS.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.123
THERE'S SOMETHING AMAZING
ABOUT THE FACT

25:48.147 --> 25:50.650
THAT THE FILM BEGINS
WITH THE WINDOWS.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.652
THE WINDOWS
ARE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY

25:52.685 --> 25:54.220
TO SPREAD
THE TIFFANY MAGIC.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.955
AND THAT'S WHY THE FILM
BEGINS THAT WAY.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.356
YOU KNOW,
SHE GETS OUT OF THE CAR,

25:57.389 --> 25:59.158
SHE LOOK AT THE WINDOW

25:59.191 --> 26:00.960
AND SHE'S INSTANTLY
TRANSPORTED.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.005
IN WINDOW ONE, SHE WAS LOOKING
AT THESE TALL WOODEN STRUCTURES.

26:13.039 --> 26:16.275
THEY WERE KIND OF, LIKE,
MULTIFACETED WOODEN PIECES

26:16.308 --> 26:19.812
WITH BEAUTIFUL
SCHLUMBERGER BRACELETS ON THEM.

26:19.846 --> 26:23.783
IN WINDOW TWO,
IT'S MINIATURE CHANDELIERS
SUSPENDED BEAUTIFULLY

26:23.816 --> 26:25.985
WITH BROOCHES
SUSPENDED WITHIN THEM.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.687
THEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY
BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS

26:27.720 --> 26:30.957
AND THOSE WERE VERY ICONIC
GENE MOORE DISPLAYS.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.092
PERHAPS THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE

26:33.125 --> 26:36.028
SAW, ON A GLOBAL SCALE,
GENE MOORE'S WORK.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.414
♪ UH!

26:55.447 --> 26:57.784
IT'S FUN.
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE WHOLE THING.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.318
IT'S FUN TO DO.

26:59.351 --> 27:04.090
I LOVE DOING IT EVEN,
UH, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.193
GENE WAS REALLY A PIONEER
IN MODERN WINDOW DISPLAY.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.696
BECAUSE IN THE PAST,
THE IDEA WAS

27:09.729 --> 27:12.732
CRAM AS MUCH AS YOU COULD
INTO THE WINDOW

27:12.765 --> 27:14.266
AND HAVE
ALL THE PRICE TAGS ON IT

27:14.300 --> 27:16.836
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
PUSHING THE MERCHANDISE,

27:16.869 --> 27:18.905
BUT GENE DISTILLED IT.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.773
HE WOULD SHOW ONE
OR TWO PIECES,

27:20.807 --> 27:23.109
BUT IT WAS THE WAY YOU GOT IN
WAS YOU WANTED TO SEE

27:23.142 --> 27:24.844
WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO
WITH THE WINDOWS.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.454
PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN,
THE NEW GENERATION

27:26.478 --> 27:28.047
DOESN'T REALLY KNOW.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.050
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

27:32.785 --> 27:36.022
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO BREAK
A GLASS IN THE WINDOW.

27:36.055 --> 27:41.227
AND THAT WAS FUN BECAUSE
PEOPLE WOULD CALL UP AND SAY,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.462
"YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
A BROKEN GLASS IN THE WINDOW?"

27:43.495 --> 27:47.834
I SAY, YES, I KNOW.
THERE'S THE HAMMER RIGHT
BESIDE IT THAT BROKE IT.

27:47.867 --> 27:52.071
I LEARNED TO DO
THINGS DIFFERENT...

27:52.104 --> 27:55.241
UH, TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
BECAUSE

27:55.274 --> 27:58.277
I WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH
ATTENTION PEOPLE PAID TO IT.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.979
AND THEY WOULD
CALL UP AND SAY,

28:00.012 --> 28:02.148
"DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
ONE KNIFE TURNED BACKWARDS?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.884
OR ONE KEY
TURNED BACKWARDS?"

28:04.917 --> 28:06.252
I SAID, "YEAH."

28:06.285 --> 28:08.487
AND THEN I KNEW THAT
PEOPLE LOOKED AT IT.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.156
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I COULD CHECK UP.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.472
GENE MOORE HAD A WONDERFUL
SENSE OF WIT IN PLACE.

28:26.505 --> 28:30.209
HE UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE THEATRE
OF WINDOW DESIGN.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.845
HE TOOK IT TO A PLACE
THAT WOULD USE

28:32.879 --> 28:37.016
INCONGRUOUS OBJECTS
WITH BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.969
I WOULD WALK AROUND
THE FLOOR WITH GENE,

28:57.003 --> 29:00.039
YOU KNOW, SELECTING PRODUCT
FOR THE WINDOW.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.108
HE USED TO LOVE TO USE EGGS.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.976
YOU KNOW,
HE USED TO BLOWOUT EGGS

29:04.010 --> 29:06.012
AND USE EGGS
A DIFFERENT WAY.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.479
EGGS, TO ME,

29:07.513 --> 29:09.949
IS THE MOST PERFECT SHAPE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.951
I LIKE 'EM THE WAY
THEY COME RIGHT OUT OF THE HEN.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.786
I DON'T BELIEVE IN
PAINTED EGGS.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.487
EGGS ARE NOT TO BE PAINTED.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.990
THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL
IN THEMSELVES

29:18.024 --> 29:20.292
THAT I'D LEAVE THEM
THE WAY THEY ARE.

29:20.326 --> 29:24.831
IT WAS ALWAYS SORT
OF JUXTAPOSED JEWELRY
AND SOMETHING UNIQUE.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.833
HE JUST DID
WHATEVER HE WANTED.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.201
THE LABOR THAT WENT INTO
CREATING THOSE THINGS

29:29.235 --> 29:30.903
AND THE ARTISTS HE ENGAGED

29:30.937 --> 29:33.405
BECAUSE HE DID ENGAGE PEOPLE
TO WORK WITH HIM.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.241
AND THEY WERE ON
HIS ROLODEX.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.376
THEY WERE NOT ON
ANYONE ELSE'S ROLODEX.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.249
YOU WERE NEV... AND THEY WERE
VERY TRUE TO HIM.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.513
ONE OF HIS MOST
SPECTACULAR WINDOWS

29:41.547 --> 29:44.917
WAS A GIANT WHITE SPHERE

29:44.951 --> 29:47.253
HANGING OVER
A STRAND OF PEARLS.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.321
AND I'D PUT THEM IN
AND I THOUGHT,

29:49.355 --> 29:51.858
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.193
YOU KNOW, IT'S... IT'S TOO CLEAN.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.062
IT'S WRONG.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.065
SO, I BROKE A STRING OF PEARL...
I THOUGHT I'LL CATCH HELL,

29:59.098 --> 30:00.432
BUT I BROKE A STRING
OF PEARLS

30:00.466 --> 30:02.869
AND I HAD THE PEARLS,
YOU KNOW...

30:02.902 --> 30:04.203
AND IT HELPED THE WINDOW.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.405
IT MADE THE WINDOW
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.440
AND ONLY GENE
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

30:08.474 --> 30:10.943
TO GET AWAY WITH SHOWING
DAMAGED GOODS

30:10.977 --> 30:13.012
IN THE WINDOWS AT TIFFANY'S.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.882
THEY THE... TEASING GLIMPSE

30:15.915 --> 30:20.186
INTO A WORLD
THAT YOU WANT TO BE PART OF.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.088
IT WAS VERY HUMBLING
TO BE THINKING

30:22.121 --> 30:24.857
I'M PART OF SOMETHING
THAT'S ENDED UP

30:24.891 --> 30:28.060
IN A WINDOW AT TIFFANY'S
ON FIFTH AVENUE.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.495
I MEAN,
IT'S A PRIVILEGE AND A JOY.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.131
IMAGINE A HOUSE
OF TIFFANY'S SAYING,

30:32.164 --> 30:35.234
HEY, GO AND MAKE
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

30:35.267 --> 30:40.239
AND WORK WITH THESE
EXTRAORDINARY CRAFTS PEOPLE
UPSTAIRS

30:40.272 --> 30:44.476
WHO LITERALLY STILL
HAND MAKE THE ITEMS.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.880
IS THAT YOU, MY LOVELY?

30:51.283 --> 30:55.221
DAISY BUCHANAN,
"THE GOLDEN GIRL."

30:55.254 --> 30:57.423
A BREATHLESS WARMTH
FLOWED FROM HER.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.359
A PROMISE THAT THERE WAS
NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD

31:00.392 --> 31:02.194
SHE SO WANTED TO SEE.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.363
DO THEY MISS ME IN CHICAGO?

31:04.396 --> 31:08.334
UH, YES. UM... UM,
AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE
SEND THEIR LOVE.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.236
HOW GORGEOUS.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.004
I'VE JUST BEEN IN CHINA.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.941
I'VE JUST RELEASED
"THE GREAT GATSBY" IN CHINA.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.243
YES, THEY'RE DAZZLED
BY ALL THE LUXURY.

31:17.276 --> 31:21.513
BUT THEY'RE ALSO VERY AWARE
OF THE HEART ISSUE OF THE BOOK.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.952
AND THAT IS THIS PARADOX
BETWEEN THIS ROARING '20s,

31:25.985 --> 31:29.922
WHERE THERE'S "SUCH AN ORGY OF
MONEY," TO QUOTE FITZGERALD.

31:29.956 --> 31:33.025
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS KIND OF DEVASTATION

31:33.059 --> 31:36.328
IN THE AMERICAN DREAM,
IF YOU LIKE.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.697
THERE MUST BE A CENTER
AND THERE MUST BE MEANING.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.001
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS,

31:42.034 --> 31:44.103
THE PEOPLE
HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED

31:44.136 --> 31:45.437
A TREMENDOUS CHANGE.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.573
NOT JUST IN THEIR LIFESTYLE,
BUT IN THE...

31:47.606 --> 31:50.376
IN THE WAY THEY FEEL
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.312
A LOT OF CHINESE
WERE STARTING TO GET WEALTHY

31:53.345 --> 31:55.114
AND THEY THOUGHT
WITH THAT WEALTH

31:55.147 --> 31:57.950
THEY SHOULD TREAT THEMSELVES
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.451
AND THEY'VE GOT
TO THIS POINT NOW

31:59.485 --> 32:02.989
WHERE, FINALLY, THEY CAN
LIVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE

32:03.022 --> 32:07.026
AND THEY CAN START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT

32:07.059 --> 32:08.694
AND NOT JUST
WHAT THEY NEED.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.097
THIS IDEA
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND...

32:11.130 --> 32:14.266
AND WHEN YOU THINK
"AMERICAN DREAM,
"CHINESE DREAM,"

32:14.300 --> 32:17.003
AND THE VISION
THAT THEY BOTH SPEAK TO,

32:17.036 --> 32:19.538
YOU REALIZE
THAT ALL THE VALUES

32:19.571 --> 32:22.608
THAT THEY'RE SELLING
ARE UNIVERSAL.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.044
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO OWN
ANYTHING TILL I CAN FIND A PLACE

32:25.077 --> 32:26.712
WHERE A MILLION THINGS
GO TOGETHER.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.081
I'M NOT SURE
WHERE THAT IS, BUT...

32:29.115 --> 32:32.518
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.387
- IT'S LIKE TIFFANY'S.
- TIFFANY'S?

32:35.421 --> 32:38.624
- YOU MEAN THE JEWELRY STORE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.027
I'M CRAZY
ABOUT TIFFANY'S.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.263
ALTHOUGH TIFFANY IN ITS... ITS
CURRENT INCARNATION

32:44.296 --> 32:47.066
IS NOT
A CELEBRITY-DRIVEN BRAND,

32:47.099 --> 32:51.103
THE ONE CELEBRITY
WHO IS BEYOND REPROACH,
WHO IS ENDURINGLY POPULAR,

32:51.137 --> 32:52.471
WHO WILL ALWAYS
BE ASSOCIATED

32:52.504 --> 32:54.106
WITH THE BRAND
IS AUDREY HEPBURN.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.608
I WAS DEFINITELY
FAMILIARIZED WITH...

32:56.642 --> 32:58.577
WITH THE WHOLE NOTION
OF TIFFANY'S

32:58.610 --> 33:00.779
THROUGH THE MOVIE
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S."

33:00.812 --> 33:03.382
FOR ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
SEEING THAT MOVIE,

33:03.415 --> 33:06.652
SEEING HER AND SEEING
THE NAME "TIFFANY'S,"

33:06.685 --> 33:09.788
EMBODIED EVERYTHING
THAT WAS GLAMOROUS,

33:09.821 --> 33:12.758
AND SLIGHTLY UNATTAINABLE,
ABOUT NEW YORK.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.460
WELL, NO, BECAUSE
OF THE TITLE,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.761
GREAT PRODUCT PLACEMENT

33:15.794 --> 33:17.629
WITHOUT NEEDING... WITHOUT
MEANING IT.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.300
TIFFANY GOT LUCKY,
SORT OF IN THE SAME WAY THAT

33:21.333 --> 33:23.769
CAMPBELL'S SOUP GOT LUCKY
WITH ANDY WARHOL.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.538
IT JUST HAPPENED
THAT THIS FILM WAS MADE.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.708
IT WAS NOT MADE FOR ANY KIND
OF ADVERTORIAL PURPOSE.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.211
IT'S PERFECT.
IT'S A PERFECT IMAGE.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.347
A LOT OF PEOPLE CONFUSE ME
WITH AUDREY HEPBURN. UM...

33:35.381 --> 33:37.425
THERE ARE GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT,
THERE ARE HORRIBLE THINGS
ABOUT IT.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.051
- WHAT'S HORRIBLE?
- MICKEY ROONEY.

33:39.085 --> 33:42.421
UGH! OOH!

33:42.454 --> 33:44.356
MICKEY ROONEY,
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S"?

33:44.390 --> 33:47.259
WHERE'S HIS OSCAR?
COME ON!

33:47.293 --> 33:50.196
IN 30 SECONDS
I GOT TO CALL THE POLICE!

33:50.229 --> 33:52.064
THAT'S GROTESQUE.
AND, OF COURSE,

33:52.098 --> 33:54.266
IT WAS NEVER ACTUALLY "OKAY."
IT WAS JUST ALLOWED.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.810
YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS OF THINGS
WERE ALLOWED,

33:55.834 --> 33:57.069
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE OKAY.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.837
I GENUINELY ADMIRE THE MOVIE.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.740
I ADMIRE THE RISKS
THAT WERE TAKEN

34:01.773 --> 34:03.842
BY AUDREY HEPBURN,
BY BLAKE EDWARDS.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.079
MANCINI AND, UH, GIVENCHY.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.420
YOU WANT A CHARACTER
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.455
WELL, AT THE TIME,
I... I...

34:16.487 --> 34:18.456
I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY
INTERESTING CHOICE.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.592
I MEAN, SHE HAD STYLE.
SHE HAD CLASS.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.563
SHE HAD A QUALITY, I THINK,
THAT... THAT WORKED.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.466
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNOW
THAT SHE WAS SORT OF LIKE, UH,

34:27.498 --> 34:30.869
A PROSTITUTE... HIGH END KINDA
PROSTITUTE IN NEW YORK CITY,

34:30.902 --> 34:33.339
TRYING TO CLAW HER WAY
UP TO THE TOP.

34:33.371 --> 34:37.309
I THINK WHEN NOW THEY SEE IT,
SHE LOOKS LIKE A SOCIALITE.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.543
THEY THINK SHE IS A SOCIALITE.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.655
WON'T YOU JOIN ME?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.657
YES, JOIN AUDREY HEPBURN

34:51.690 --> 34:53.324
AS YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE...

34:53.359 --> 34:55.393
KICKING OVER THE TRACES
AND BRINGING TO LIFE

34:55.427 --> 34:58.197
TRUMAN CAPOTE'S
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S."

35:00.232 --> 35:01.909
WELL, THE FIRST TIME I SAW
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S,"

35:01.933 --> 35:03.335
IT DIDN'T... DIDN'T CROSS MY MIND

35:03.369 --> 35:05.304
THAT SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.340
CAPOTE DOESN'T COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT,

35:08.374 --> 35:11.177
BUT IF YOU READ
BETWEEN THE LINES

35:11.210 --> 35:14.813
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
HE WANTED YOU TO CONSIDER.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.516
MY MOM TOLD ME AFTERWARDS,
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"

35:17.549 --> 35:19.685
REALLY? WHAT'D SHE SAY?
SHE WAS LIKE, "BY THE WAY..."

35:19.718 --> 35:22.154
YEAH, SHE WAS LIKE,
"YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S
A CALL-GIRL?"

35:22.188 --> 35:25.524
AND I'M LIKE, "WH... WHY?"

35:25.557 --> 35:27.859
"WHAT GAVE YOU THAT SENSE?"

35:27.893 --> 35:29.861
BUT, YEAH, I MEAN,
IN RETROSPECT,

35:29.895 --> 35:32.298
I'M LIKE, "OKAY,
IT'S A BIT OBVIOUS

35:32.331 --> 35:33.899
ONCE YOU HAVE THAT
IN YOUR MIND."

35:33.932 --> 35:35.901
- SHE'S A HOOKER?
- ARE YOU SURPRISED

35:35.934 --> 35:37.445
THEY WOULD MAKE A DOLL
OUT OF A HOOKER?

35:37.469 --> 35:38.937
WHY'D THEY DO THAT?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.273
- SERIOUSLY? SHE'S A HOOKER?
- YEAH.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.584
THEN WHY IS SHE
DRESSED LIKE THAT

35:42.608 --> 35:44.576
GOING TO TIFFANY'S
FOR BREAKFAST?

35:44.610 --> 35:47.879
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING ON SCREEN.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.849
THE SUN IS COMING UP...

35:50.882 --> 35:54.553
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,
IN EVENING DRESS,

35:54.586 --> 35:56.888
IS GETTING OUT OF CAB.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.924
WHY? WHAT IS SHE DOING

35:58.957 --> 36:01.627
IN AN EVENING DRESS
AT THAT HOUR?

36:01.660 --> 36:04.363
IS SHE GOING OUT
TO A PARTY AT SUNRISE?

36:04.396 --> 36:06.732
PROBABLY NOT. MORE LIKELY,

36:06.765 --> 36:09.835
SHE'S COMING HOME
FROM A PARTY AT SUNRISE.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.746
- AND THEN THE NEXT...
- THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMP...

36:11.770 --> 36:15.407
- AND THE NEXT MORNING...
- OH! SO SHE... OH!

36:15.441 --> 36:17.343
SO SHE HOOKED UP
WITH A RICH GUY,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.745
- AND SHE WANTS THAT GUY...
- NO. WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.247
THEN WHAT'S UP
WITH HER OUTFIT?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.415
SHE WANTS EXTRA CASH
ON THE SIDE,

36:23.449 --> 36:25.417
SO SHE'S ALWAYS
HOOKING UP WITH MEN, RIGHT?

36:25.451 --> 36:26.785
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN...

36:26.818 --> 36:28.920
SHE WAS... A GAL

36:28.954 --> 36:31.823
WHO DID TAKE MONEY
FOR ENTERTAINING GUYS,

36:31.857 --> 36:33.825
IT DIDN'T... IT DIDN'T
SPECIFICALLY SAY

36:33.859 --> 36:37.829
IT BECAME A SEXUAL
SITUATION OR NOT. BUT, UH...

36:37.863 --> 36:40.599
I DON'T THINK,
IN THE FILM,

36:40.632 --> 36:42.368
YOU LOOK AT HER AS
AN OUT-AND-OUT HOOKER.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.537
SHE'S GOT TOO MANY
OTHER ELEMENTS.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.606
YOU LOVE HER KOOKINESS.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.817
"KOOK" WAS ONE OF THE WORDS...
IT WAS KIND OF A CODE WORD.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.943
IT WAS A... IT WAS A EUPHEMISM

36:51.977 --> 36:55.281
TO, UM, COMFORT
NERVOUS AUDIENCES

36:55.314 --> 36:59.485
WHO KNEW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
WHAT CAPOTE'S NOVEL WAS ABOUT,

36:59.518 --> 37:01.720
AND GET THEM TO FEEL,
SORT OF, MORE COMFORTABLE

37:01.753 --> 37:04.022
WITH THE IDEA THAT
THEY WERE SEEING

37:04.055 --> 37:06.592
A FRIENDLY MOVIE,
A SAFE MOVIE.

37:06.625 --> 37:10.028
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
CAPOTE'S ORIGINAL CONCEPT,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.531
THEN I GUESS THAT
WAS A STUDIO DECISION

37:12.564 --> 37:16.268
FOR WHAT THEY WANTED
HOLLY GOLIGHTLY TO BE LIKE.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.737
MARILYN IS CLOSER

37:18.770 --> 37:20.972
TO THE HOLLY GOLIGHTLY
IN THE NOVEL.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.908
SO, ON A CERTAIN LEVEL,

37:22.941 --> 37:27.413
IT MAKES SENSE THAT TRUMAN
WOULD WANT HER.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.657
MAN, YOU GUYS... YOU GUYS
ARE LUCKY THAT WE JUST WOKE UP.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.618
- WE'RE REALLY RAW
- YEAH, WE'RE REALLY RAW.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.487
CAN WE... CAN WE TALK ABOUT

37:35.521 --> 37:36.798
THE SONG,
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S"?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.424
SURE, GO AHEAD.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.826
BUT WE WERE OUT IN MONTAUK
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

37:40.859 --> 37:43.462
WE WERE DEEJAYING
OUR FRIEND'S WEDDING,

37:43.495 --> 37:45.831
AND WE FOUND OURSELVES
ON THE BEACH

37:45.864 --> 37:48.667
TRYING TO START
A BONFIRE.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.337
AND, UH...
BEFORE WE KNEW IT,

37:51.370 --> 37:54.340
WE WERE JOINED BY A BUNCH
OF UKRAINIAN OR...

37:54.373 --> 37:56.675
- EASTERN EUROPEAN, UKRAINIAN
- EASTERN... EASTERN, YEAH.

37:56.708 --> 38:00.679
LIKE, REALLY GOOD-LOOKING,
EASTERN EUROPEAN TEENAGERS

38:00.712 --> 38:03.014
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WORKS
IN MONTAUK FOR THE SUMMER.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.883
AND SUDDENLY, ONE OF THEM,
THE YOUNG BOY,

38:04.916 --> 38:06.618
- BREAKS OUT A GUITAR...
- YEAH.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.687
AND STARTS SINGING
ACOUSTICALLY

38:08.720 --> 38:12.758
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S"
WITH A HEAVY UKRAINIAN ACCENT...

38:12.791 --> 38:15.361
IN A SLOW JAM,
IT WAS AMAZING.

38:15.394 --> 38:18.697
IN THIS VERY BROKEN
SORT OF ENGLISH, UM...

38:18.730 --> 38:20.799
WHICH MADE IT
KIND OF BETTER, SOMEHOW...

38:20.832 --> 38:24.102
HE'S SINGING IT
AND EVERYONE'S SINGING ALONG.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.837
AND I'M LOOKING AT THEM
AND I'M LIKE,

38:25.871 --> 38:27.773
"YOU GUYS ARE 16,
AND 17, AND 18.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.641
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG

38:29.675 --> 38:32.544
- TO KNOW THIS SONG...
- ALSO, THEY'RE UKRANIAN.

38:32.578 --> 38:36.047
-YEAH, LIKE, HOW DID YOU...
-THEY WERE COMMUNIST
A FEW YEARS AGO,

38:36.081 --> 38:38.384
AND NOW THEY'RE SINGING
A CAPITALIST SONG

38:38.417 --> 38:40.051
ABOUT BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.389
I THOUGHT IF I COULD
GET THAT PHRASE,

38:43.422 --> 38:45.724
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S,"
INTO A SONG

38:45.757 --> 38:47.626
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE IT.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.062
IT SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST SAY...

38:51.096 --> 38:53.632
♪ BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S,
BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, ♪

38:53.665 --> 38:55.501

'BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S?'

38:58.103 --> 39:00.706

39:04.810 --> 39:08.480
WELL, THEN, I GUESS THAT'S

39:08.514 --> 39:10.816
ALMOST NOTHING POETIC
ABOUT IT.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.420

39:56.828 --> 39:58.196

IN THERE AND FIND YOU

41:15.807 --> 41:17.509
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RING
THAT THEY HAVE.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.513
ALL RIGHTY!

41:21.547 --> 41:23.114
FROM THAT MOMENT ON,

41:23.148 --> 41:24.883
CHARLOTTE WOULD TELL EVERYONE

41:24.916 --> 41:26.652
THAT RIGHT IN FRONT
OF TIFFANY'S,

41:26.685 --> 41:29.521
OUT OF NOWHERE
TREY POPPED THE QUESTION

41:29.555 --> 41:31.857
AND SHE SAID, "ALL RIGHTY."

41:33.592 --> 41:37.629
THE ENGAGEMENT RING
AS WE KNOW IT

41:37.663 --> 41:39.665
WAS INTRODUCED
BY TIFFANY HIMSELF.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.700
CHARLES TIFFANY
CREATED A RING

41:41.733 --> 41:43.969
THAT WAS MORE BRILLIANT
THAN ALL OTHERS.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.771
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RING

41:45.804 --> 41:48.306
WHERE THE STONE WAS LIFTED
UP OFF THE BAND

41:48.339 --> 41:51.242
AND HELD UP SO THAT
THE LIGHT COULD SCINTILLATE.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.278
THIS IS THE ONE
YOU SEE IN CARTOONS.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.946
I GOT A SURPRISE
FOR BETTY.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.248
GET A LOAD OF THIS.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.684
WOW!

41:58.717 --> 42:02.921
OOH-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO,
WHAT A SPARKLER.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.690
I REMEMBER WHEN
WE FIRST GOT ENGAGED,

42:04.723 --> 42:06.925
WALKING IN THERE
AND BEING SO SHOCKED
AT THE PRICES.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.094
I SAID, "WE GOTTA LOOK
SOMEWHERE ELSE."

42:09.127 --> 42:11.096
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YES.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.799
I THINK I WAS 20... 24,
25-YEARS-OLD AT THE TIME.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.567
I COULDN'T QUITE
AFFORD TIFFANY'S, SO...

42:15.601 --> 42:16.735
REALLY? YOU'RE A MARA.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.136
I... YEAH, BUT...

42:18.169 --> 42:20.071
I WAS A STRUGGLING
YOUNG LAWYER AT THE TIME.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.873
I... I THINK IT
WAS SOME PLACE

42:21.907 --> 42:23.675
- ON 47TH STREET AT THE TIME.
- 47TH STREET?

42:23.709 --> 42:25.711
- YEAH, YEAH.
- THAT'LL GET YOU.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.813
YES, YES.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.748
THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT THING
AT TIFFANY'S

42:29.781 --> 42:31.626
- IS JUST A STORY IN ITSELF.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:31.650 --> 42:33.619
IT'S A MYSTERY.
I JUST SEE PEOPLE THERE

42:33.652 --> 42:35.654
AND KIDS
AND GROWNUPS, LIKE...

42:35.687 --> 42:38.256
- DOES ANYONE EVER BUY
AN ENGAGEMENT RING THERE?

42:38.289 --> 42:42.794
NO, ACTUALLY, TODAY WE HAVE
A LOT OF SELF-PURCHASERS.

42:42.828 --> 42:45.897
AND SO, THE LARGER,
THE PURER,

42:45.931 --> 42:47.833
THE RARER, THE BETTER.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.735
THEY ALL WANT PICASSOS,
BUT ON THEIR FINGERS.

43:00.345 --> 43:03.281
UM, HERE I HAVE...

43:06.217 --> 43:08.253
I ONLY HAVE ONE...
ACTUALLY, I HAVE ABOUT

43:08.286 --> 43:10.922
TWO AND A HALF MILLION
DOLLARS RIGHT HERE,
2.5 MILLION.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.323
IT ALLOWS YOU
TO GET A RING

43:12.357 --> 43:14.225
FOR HER FOR EVERY OCCASION.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.227
SO, ONE FOR EVERY DAY.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.829
THIS, ACTUALLY,
IS VERY REASONABLE.

43:17.863 --> 43:18.997
$306,000.

43:20.365 --> 43:21.800
ONE FOR DINNER...

43:23.702 --> 43:26.004
THIS IS A TIFFANY LUCIDA.

43:26.037 --> 43:29.140
THIS IS A 5-CARAT,
IT'S A D-20 FLAWLESS.

43:29.174 --> 43:31.176
AND ONE FOR THE GALA...

43:31.209 --> 43:33.211
AND THIS ALSO IS 5-CARATS.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.114
SO TIFFANY'S SETTING
THE 5-CARATS AT D, VVS1

43:36.147 --> 43:38.016
AND IT'S $923,000.

43:38.049 --> 43:40.151
STILL A BARGAIN,
JUST SUB-ONE MILLION.

43:40.185 --> 43:42.821
BY THE WAY,
WE DO ACCEPT CASH.

43:42.854 --> 43:45.824
THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE THERE
ALL ASPIRE TO HAVE THAT,

43:45.857 --> 43:47.192
AND THEN GIRLS TRY IT ON,

43:47.225 --> 43:48.894
BUT I WOULD THINK
IT'S DISAPPOINTING,

43:48.927 --> 43:50.705
'CAUSE THEN I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY ACTUALLY BUY IT.

43:50.729 --> 43:52.931
AND THEN THEY WILL
HAVE TO WALK DOWN 15 BLOCKS

43:52.964 --> 43:55.300
TO GO GET
A COPY OF THE...

43:55.333 --> 43:57.068
RING.

43:57.102 --> 43:58.704
IT ALWAYS GOES LIKE THIS...

43:58.737 --> 44:04.042
"OH, MY COUSIN KNOWS
SOMEONE ON 47TH STREET."

44:04.075 --> 44:05.043
DID YOU GET A BLUE BOX

44:05.076 --> 44:06.878
WHEN YOU GOT ENGAGED?

44:06.912 --> 44:08.714
- I DIDN'T.
- YOU DIDN'T?

44:08.747 --> 44:12.317
NO, AND I ASKED WHY NOT.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.995
- [BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS... -
DIRECTOR] AT THAT MOMENT?

44:14.019 --> 44:16.054
- LISTEN... NO, NO.
- BEFORE HE EVEN ASKED YOU?

44:16.087 --> 44:19.057
I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T,
BUT WE WERE VERY YOUNG

44:19.090 --> 44:21.860
AND HE WAS A WAITER, AND...

44:21.893 --> 44:23.304
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
BLUE BOXES REALLY CAME

44:23.328 --> 44:27.098
A LOT VERY OFTEN
AT THAT TIME... I WAS, LIKE, 22.

44:27.132 --> 44:29.935
IF WE EVER DID GET MARRIED
WHICH, WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
MARRIAGE,

44:29.968 --> 44:34.740
-IT'S A GREAT INSTITUTION.
-YEAH, BUT WHO WANTS TO BE
PART OF AN INSTITUTION?

44:34.773 --> 44:37.408
- TIFFANY. RIGHT HERE.
- IS THAT RIGHT?

44:37.442 --> 44:39.410
- SO THEN LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
- MY WEDDING RING.

44:39.444 --> 44:41.079
SO THEN, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU KNOW THAT

44:41.112 --> 44:43.782
-THEY PUT OUT
THIS GAY AD, RIGHT?
-NO.

44:43.815 --> 44:45.116
THE FAMED TIFFANY AND COMPANY

44:45.150 --> 44:47.418
THINKING OUTSIDE
OF THE LITTLE BLUE BOX TONIGHT.

44:47.452 --> 44:49.354
CHECK OUT THIS NEW AD
FOR ENGAGEMENT RINGS

44:49.387 --> 44:51.489
FEATURING A REAL-LIFE
GAY COUPLE.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.091
IT'S GOING VIRAL TONIGHT.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.927
TIFFANY SAYS, "IT'S PART
OF A MODERN APPROACH

44:55.961 --> 44:57.162
TO LOVE AND ROMANCE."

44:57.195 --> 44:58.764
OH, HOW GREAT.

44:58.797 --> 45:00.098
NOW, WHY IS THAT GREAT?

45:00.131 --> 45:02.100
WELL, BECAUSE
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

45:02.133 --> 45:04.302
A SPOKESMAN FOR TIFFANY'S
SAID THAT EVERYONE,

45:04.335 --> 45:06.447
WHETHER THEY ARE
GAY OR STRAIGHT,
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

45:06.471 --> 45:10.108
- TO GROSSLY OVERPAY
FOR JEWELRY.

45:10.141 --> 45:11.877
IT'S A RIGHT WE ALL HAVE.

45:11.910 --> 45:13.111
WELL, YEAH,
BUT THEY'RE ALSO

45:13.144 --> 45:14.512
SUPPORTING
THEIR BOTTOM LINE.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.916
THEY REALIZE THERE IS
THIS WHOLE NEW CATEGORY

45:17.949 --> 45:20.952
OF PEOPLE
WHO CAN GET MARRIED.

45:20.986 --> 45:24.289
THEY WANNA SEE THOSE PEOPLE
WEARING TIFFANY RINGS.

45:24.322 --> 45:25.991
'CAUSE WHENEVER YOU GET
A TIFFANY RING,

45:26.024 --> 45:27.501
YOU, LIKE, "KNOW"
IT'S FROM TIFFANY'S.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.294
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- I MEAN, 'CAUSE...

45:29.327 --> 45:32.463
FIRST OF ALL, THE STYLE
AND THE COLOR OF THE BOX.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.299
BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T
HAVE THE BOX,

45:34.332 --> 45:36.134
JUST SOMETHING
IN THE DIAMOND...

45:36.167 --> 45:38.369
THEY'RE REALLY WHITE,
THEY'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

45:38.403 --> 45:40.972
I THINK THAT IF YOU
GET IT FROM, LIKE...

45:41.006 --> 45:44.009
UM, OTHER JEWELRY BRANDS...
SEE, I DON'T KNOW THAT MANY.

45:44.042 --> 45:46.044
'CAUSE I KNOW TIFFANY,
THAT'S IT.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.379
AND THE MORE HE SPENDS...
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

45:48.413 --> 45:50.315
THE MORE HE LOVES YOU.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.317
- OR THE MORE HE'S RICH.
- -DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

45:52.350 --> 45:55.153
-WELL, THE MORE HE SPENDS...
-THE MORE HE WANTS
TO WIN YOU OVER.

45:55.186 --> 45:57.823
THE MORE HE WANTS
TO WIN YOU OVER.

45:57.856 --> 45:59.500
SO I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED
TO TIFFANY AND COMPANY

45:59.524 --> 46:00.992
WHEN I WAS IN
THE EIGHTH GRADE.

46:01.026 --> 46:02.994
MY NANA TOOK ME TO PICK OUT

46:03.028 --> 46:04.329
MY FIRST PIECE OF TIFFANY'S

46:04.362 --> 46:06.531
AND FROM THERE ON,
I BECAME OBSESSED.

46:06.564 --> 46:09.835
UH, THEN I MET
MY NOW-HUSBAND

46:09.868 --> 46:12.971
AND HE PROPOSED TO ME
AT THE TIFFANY AND COMPANY
IN BOSTON.

46:13.004 --> 46:15.106
SO WE WERE WATCHING
"SWEET HOME ALABAMA" ONE NIGHT

46:15.140 --> 46:16.441
WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED DATING.

46:16.474 --> 46:18.944
AND I JUST,
OFFHANDED COMMENT, SAID,

46:18.977 --> 46:20.912
"THAT WOULD BE
THE MOST MAGICAL,

46:20.946 --> 46:22.180
AMAZING PROPOSAL."

46:22.213 --> 46:24.382
AND HE SOMEHOW REMEMBERED.

46:24.415 --> 46:27.252
AND SO, FROM THERE,
I DECIDED TO FOLLOW THE THEME.

46:27.285 --> 46:30.288
AND WE DID A TIFFANY
AND COMPANY-THEMED WEDDING,

46:30.321 --> 46:33.258
I DID A TIFFANY
AND COMPANY-THEMED
BRIDAL SHOWER,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.193
BACHELORETTE PARTY.

46:35.226 --> 46:37.028
I'M PRETTY SURE,
WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN,

46:37.062 --> 46:39.865
I'LL PROBABLY DO A TIFFANY
AND COMPANY-THEMED BABY SHOWER.

46:39.898 --> 46:42.367
THANKS, NOW PEOPLE
ARE GONNA THINK I'M CRAZY.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.470
THEY'RE GONNA, LIKE, TAKE ME
TO TIFFANY-REHAB AFTER THIS.

46:45.503 --> 46:47.873
WHEN I FIRST WROTE
"SWEET HOME ALABAMA,"

46:47.906 --> 46:49.407
I WROTE A NORMAL SCENE
WHERE A GUY

46:49.440 --> 46:51.209
JUST, UH, PROPOSED
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.

46:51.242 --> 46:53.144
AND THAT, I THINK,
WAS A VERY PRIVATE MOMENT.

46:53.178 --> 46:55.613
SO, WROTE THE MOVIE,
TURNED IT INTO THE STUDIO.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.348
THE STUDIO SAID,
"WE LOVE THE SCRIPT,

46:57.382 --> 47:00.151
BUT WE THINK YOU COULD
DO BETTER WITH THE PROPOSAL."

47:00.185 --> 47:04.089
CAN WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING
JUST A LITTLE MORE DAZZLING

47:04.122 --> 47:06.892
BECAUSE THE PATRICK DEMPSEY
CHARACTER WAS SUPPOSED

47:06.925 --> 47:08.459
TO BE THIS KIND OF
REALLY COOL GUY.

47:08.493 --> 47:11.062
AND HE WAS THE, YOU KNOW,
"THE MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR"

47:11.096 --> 47:13.131
DATING REESE WITHERSPOON'S
CHARACTER.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.900
SO, I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT

47:14.933 --> 47:17.002
AND MY WIFE SAID, "SO HOW DID
IT GO AT THE STUDIO?"

47:17.035 --> 47:19.304
AND I SAID, "WELL,
IT'S ALL REALLY GOOD

47:19.337 --> 47:21.506
BUT THEY NOW WANT ME
TO COME UP WITH

47:21.539 --> 47:24.976
THE BEST, YOU KNOW, PROPOSAL
THAT'S EVER BEEN ON FILM."

47:25.010 --> 47:27.412
SO WE STARTED THROWING IDEAS
AROUND AT THE DINNER TABLE,

47:27.445 --> 47:30.081
AND SHE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS PROPOSED TO ONCE

47:30.115 --> 47:32.350
AT TIFFANY'S."

47:32.383 --> 47:34.585
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WAIT, WHAT?"

47:34.619 --> 47:36.587
AND SO I FOUND OUT
THAT NIGHT THAT MY WIFE

47:36.621 --> 47:39.124
HAD BEEN PROPOSED TO
ABOUT FIVE TIMES.

47:39.157 --> 47:41.026
- WHAT?
- AND, UM...

47:41.059 --> 47:43.261
SO I WAS LIKE, "HUH."

47:43.294 --> 47:45.372
SO I SAY, "WELL,
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU MEAN HE WALKED YOU..."

47:45.396 --> 47:48.433
AND THEN SHE SAID, "WELL,
HE WALKED ME INTO TIFFANY'S,

47:48.466 --> 47:50.936
AND HE SAID 'PICK ONE.'"

47:50.969 --> 47:53.271
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY YES?"

47:53.304 --> 47:56.107
ANDREW, ARE YOU ON
SOME SORT OF MEDICATION?

47:56.141 --> 47:58.576
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE ARE WE?

48:20.331 --> 48:22.433
OH, MY GOD.

48:22.467 --> 48:24.435
OH... OH, MY GOD.

48:31.176 --> 48:33.044
OH, MY GOD.

48:33.078 --> 48:34.312
I THINK THE SCENE
IN TIFFANY'S

48:34.345 --> 48:35.722
IS ONE OF MY MOST
RECOGNIZED SCENES.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.083
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY MY WALL
IS TIFFANY BLUE.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.651
I MEAN, I LITERALLY... WHEN
I WAS MOVING INTO THIS OFFICE

48:40.685 --> 48:43.488
AND MY, YOU KNOW, THE GUY
WHO WAS DECORATING IT.

48:43.521 --> 48:46.391
I JUST SAID,
"THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME SORTA
TIFFANY COLOR IN HERE."

48:46.424 --> 48:49.160
HAS TO BE A TIP OF A HAT
TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL MOVIE

48:49.194 --> 48:50.561
AND A VERY SUCCESSFUL SCENE.

48:50.595 --> 48:52.563
YES.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.532
YES! YES!

48:54.565 --> 48:56.234
YES!

49:00.538 --> 49:02.340
PICK ONE.

49:02.373 --> 49:04.275
COME ON, COME ON.

49:11.049 --> 49:15.220
I ACTUALLY WENT
TO BORA BORA WITH MY WIFE

49:15.253 --> 49:17.222
AS SORT OF
A SECOND HONEYMOON,

49:17.255 --> 49:20.425
AND WE RAN IN... YOU KNOW,
WE RAN INTO HONEYMOONERS,

49:20.458 --> 49:22.593
AND AS WE STARTED TALKING
AND GETTING TO KNOW THEM,

49:22.627 --> 49:24.062
THEY FOUND OUT
I WAS A FILM DIRECTOR

49:24.095 --> 49:25.372
AND WHEN I SAID
"SWEET HOME ALABAMA,"

49:25.396 --> 49:27.032
THEY WERE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD! TIFFANY'S!"

49:32.403 --> 49:34.539
WELL, I NEEDED
TO USE JEWELRY

49:34.572 --> 49:37.042
IN THE "OCEAN'S" TRILOGY,

49:37.075 --> 49:41.112
AND I HAD TO DRESS
SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMEN IN THE WORLD

49:41.146 --> 49:43.214
WITH SOME OF THE HANDSOMEST
MEN IN THE WORLD.

49:43.248 --> 49:45.550
SO I FIGURED I'D BETTER GO
TO THE MOST IMPORTANT

49:45.583 --> 49:47.652
JEWELRY COMPANY
IN THE WORLD.

49:47.685 --> 49:51.156
WHEN A PERSON PUTS ON
A GREAT PIECE OF JEWELRY,

49:51.189 --> 49:53.724
AND A TIFFANY JEWELRY,
THEY FEEL A CERTAIN WAY.

49:53.758 --> 49:55.393
IT GIVES THEM A CERTAIN
JOIE DE VIVRE

49:55.426 --> 49:57.728
THAT THEY DON'T... MIGHT NOT
HAVE WITHOUT THAT.

49:57.762 --> 50:00.065
I MEAN, JULIA HAS IT
EITHER WAY.

50:00.098 --> 50:02.067
BUT IT MAKES HER FEEL GOOD,

50:02.100 --> 50:04.735
MAKES HER FEEL LIKE SHE HAS
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ON,
WHICH SHE DOES.

50:04.769 --> 50:08.206
WITH MOVIE STARS
LIKE JULIA ROBERTS
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH,

50:08.239 --> 50:11.609
I DON'T SAY, "WEAR THIS,
AND WEAR IT NOW!"

50:11.642 --> 50:13.278
I SIT DOWN WITH THEM
AND I SAY,

50:13.311 --> 50:14.812
"THIS IS JEWELRY
FROM TIFFANY'S.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.715
TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE
WHAT CATCHES YOUR EYE,

50:17.748 --> 50:19.417
SEE WHAT YOU ENJOY."

50:19.450 --> 50:21.286
AND THEN THEY FIND THINGS
THAT THEY LIKE

50:21.319 --> 50:23.121
AND THEY TRY 'EM ON.

50:23.154 --> 50:25.099
AND THEY TRY 'EM ON
WITH THE DRESS THEY'RE WEARING

50:25.123 --> 50:26.500
AND THEY TRY 'EM ON AGAIN
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.759
AND THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND
FOUR, FIVE TIMES.

50:28.793 --> 50:32.697
SO... AND THEN THEY FINALLY
SETTLE IN ON A PIECE.

50:32.730 --> 50:34.765
YOU ARE UP TO SOMETHING,
DANNY. WHAT?

50:34.799 --> 50:36.434
AND DON'T SAY
"YOU CAME HERE FOR ME."

50:36.467 --> 50:37.768
YOU'RE PULLING A JOB,
AREN'T YOU?

50:37.802 --> 50:40.438
WELL, KNOW THIS.
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,

50:40.471 --> 50:42.773
YOU WON'T WIN ME BACK.

50:42.807 --> 50:45.243
TESS, I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOODBYE.

50:45.276 --> 50:47.312
I GOT YOU SOMETHING,
AND, UM...

50:47.345 --> 50:48.789
- AW, IT'S A TIFFANY BOX.
- THANK YOU, YEAH.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.449
I WASN'T... I WASN'T INVITED
TO THE WEDDING.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.784
NO.

50:53.818 --> 50:55.453
YEAH, WE DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER.

50:55.486 --> 50:57.464
NOT WELL ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO COME TO THE WEDDING, NO.

50:57.488 --> 50:59.457
IT WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY ODD.

50:59.490 --> 51:01.859
I KNOW I DON'T KNOW YOU,
BUT I JUST WANTED

51:01.892 --> 51:04.129
- TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
- OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU.

51:04.162 --> 51:06.464
-YOU CAN SHARE THAT
WITH YOUR WIFE.
-CAN I OPEN IT NOW?

51:06.497 --> 51:08.133
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
PLEASE, PLEASE DO.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.135
IS IT, UH...

51:10.168 --> 51:13.471
WOW, IT'S... WOW, IT IS
REALLY A TIFFANY THING...

51:13.504 --> 51:15.806
OH, COME ON.
I'M ON NETWORK, NOW, MAN.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.308
OF COURSE IT'S GONNA
BE A TIFFANY.

51:17.342 --> 51:19.477
THIS ISN'T
COMEDY CENTRAL SWAG.

51:19.510 --> 51:21.146
- IT'S ENGRAVED.
- IT'S ENGRAVED.

51:21.179 --> 51:22.247
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

51:22.280 --> 51:23.614
IT SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW YOU."

51:32.323 --> 51:34.325
"SOMEONE WILL MOVE AWAY,

51:34.359 --> 51:35.860
SOMEONE WILL COME HOME,

51:35.893 --> 51:38.496
SOMEONE WILL
FINALLY GRADUATE..."

51:43.534 --> 51:45.336
WHAT WE'RE DOING
WHEN WE DO THIS

51:45.370 --> 51:48.906
IS TO EXPLAIN TIFFANY'S
PURPOSE IN THE WORLD

51:48.939 --> 51:51.142
TO, MAYBE,
A YOUNGER GENERATION

51:51.176 --> 51:52.610
THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.512
IT'S A LITTLE LOST
ON MY GENERATION

51:54.545 --> 51:57.548
'CAUSE I THINK
IT'S A BIT... TIRED.

51:57.582 --> 52:01.652
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENTS
TO TIFFANY'S.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.354
WE TOUCH ON
THE PRODUCTS WE SELL,

52:03.388 --> 52:07.758
LIKE ENGAGEMENT RINGS
AND GIFTS FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS,

52:07.792 --> 52:09.760
BUT THERE'S
NO DIRECT SELLING HERE.

52:09.794 --> 52:11.429
IT'S JUST AN ATTITUDE.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.765
IT'S A FEELING
ABOUT OUR CUSTOMER,

52:14.799 --> 52:16.667
AND WHO WE ARE.

52:16.701 --> 52:18.669
I THINK IT IS
A LITTLE BIT OF A BRAINWASH.

52:18.703 --> 52:22.807
A LOT OF THE ADS
ARE WHITE FAMILIES.

52:22.840 --> 52:26.911
IT'S... IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A 1950s KIND OF FEEL TO IT.

52:26.944 --> 52:29.614
WE WANT TO SPEAK
TO OUR CUSTOMER

52:29.647 --> 52:32.883
AS A HUMAN BEING,
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A FAMILY.

52:32.917 --> 52:35.386
MAYBE HAVE CHILDREN,
MAYBE WANTS TO GET MARRIED.

52:35.420 --> 52:38.656
IT STRETCHES TRUE LOVE
SO MUCH,

52:38.689 --> 52:40.725
IT'S SUCH AN UNREALISTIC
TRUE LOVE.

52:40.758 --> 52:43.228
WHICH ALSO, I THINK,
GIVES US

52:43.261 --> 52:44.895
A LITTLE BIT

53:46.824 --> 53:48.793
I WAS ABOUT 11 YEARS OLD

53:48.826 --> 53:51.028
AND I SAW THE AD
IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES,"

53:51.061 --> 53:52.530
WHERE TIFFANY'S ADS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN,

53:52.563 --> 53:54.031
I SAW AN AD FOR A RING.

53:54.064 --> 53:57.702
AND THE RING WAS...
COST $176,000.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.036
I REMEMBER THINKING
THAT WAS JUST

53:59.069 --> 54:00.971
AN INCONCEIVABLE AMOUNT
OF MONEY.

54:01.005 --> 54:02.907
I WAS THE SON
OF TWO WRITERS,

54:02.940 --> 54:05.343
WE WERE NOT RICH BY ANY STRETCH
OF THE IMAGINATION,

54:05.376 --> 54:06.844
AND THAT JUST
SEEMED INCREDIBLE.

54:06.877 --> 54:09.480
AND SO I WROTE THIS LETTER.
AND, ON THE ONE HAND,

54:09.514 --> 54:11.316
IT WAS... I COULD
DO THE MATH, AND SO

54:11.349 --> 54:13.518
IT WAS A SLIGHTLY
SNARKY LETTER, I SUPPOSE,

54:13.551 --> 54:14.861
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
I WAS 11 YEARS OLD.

54:14.885 --> 54:17.422
I REMEMBER THINKING,
"WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW."

54:17.455 --> 54:18.456
"DEAR TIFFANY'S...

54:30.535 --> 54:32.637
"SINCERELY, DAVID JOBLANSKI."

54:34.539 --> 54:35.573
"DEAR DAVID..."

54:55.125 --> 54:57.428
WELL, THERE'S ONE MAN
WHO AGREES WITH THAT.

54:57.462 --> 54:58.763
HIS NAME
IS WALTER HOVING

54:58.796 --> 55:01.532
AND HE IS THE PRESIDENT,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

55:01.566 --> 55:03.868
OF TIFFANY, A STORE
OF WHICH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.803
- AND HERE'S TOM BROKAW.
- THANK YOU, GENE.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.805
WALTER HOVING HAS BEEN
IN RETAILING

55:07.838 --> 55:09.807
FOR 60 YEARS NOW,
AND HE HAS BEEN AFFILIATED

55:09.840 --> 55:11.976
WITH PLACES AS DIFFERENT
AS MONTGOMERY WARD'S

55:12.009 --> 55:14.379
AND BONWITT AND TELLER
AND LORD AND TAYLOR.

55:14.412 --> 55:16.947
AND FOR THE PAST 23 YEARS,
HE'S BEEN THE CHAIRMAN
OF TIFFANY'S.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.583
LAST WEEK HE PLACED AN AD

55:18.616 --> 55:20.385
IN A NEWSPAPER, IT SAID...

55:26.090 --> 55:28.493
MR. HOVING, WHY AREN'T YOU
OPEN ON SUNDAYS?

55:28.526 --> 55:30.637
AFTER ALL, THIS IS
THE BIGGEST TIME OF THE YEAR,
I WOULD SUSPECT,

55:30.661 --> 55:32.897
-FOR TIFFANY'S.
-WE THINK OUR CUSTOMERS
NEED A REST.

55:32.930 --> 55:35.400
SO WE KEEP CLOSED
ON SUNDAYS.

55:35.433 --> 55:37.902
MR. HOVING, YOU HAVE
ON SALE AT TIFFANY'S

55:37.935 --> 55:40.905
AN EMERALD NECKLACE
THAT IS WORTH $1,700,000

55:40.938 --> 55:43.741
AND YOU HAVE A DIAMOND
THAT IS WORTH $7 MILLION,

55:43.774 --> 55:45.085
- I THINK, ALL TOGETHER.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

55:45.109 --> 55:46.911
WHAT IF SOMEONE
WERE PASSING THROUGH TOWN,

55:46.944 --> 55:49.780
AND DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED
TO BUY ONE OF THOSE TWO ITEMS,

55:49.814 --> 55:51.582
BUT THEY WERE ONLY
AVAILABLE ON SUNDAY.

55:51.616 --> 55:53.760
WOULD YOU OPEN THE STORE TO SELL
THEM ONE OF THOSE TWO ITEMS?

55:53.784 --> 55:56.921
- NO, WE WOULD NOT. NO.
- YOU'D PASS
ON THAT SALE?

55:56.954 --> 55:58.756
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WALTER HOVING,

55:58.789 --> 56:00.601
OUTSPOKEN CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD
OF A LITTLE STORE,

56:00.625 --> 56:02.168
AS WE LIKE TO SAY ON
THE CORNER HERE IN NEW YORK,

56:02.192 --> 56:03.628
CALLED TIFFANY'S.

56:28.786 --> 56:30.621
IS IT HEAVY
WHEN YOU PICK IT UP?

56:30.655 --> 56:32.623
UH, NOT REALLY, NO.
BUT I REMEMBER

56:32.657 --> 56:35.192
BEING HANDED THE TROPHY
AND REMEMBER THINKING

56:35.225 --> 56:37.795
"PLEASE DON'T DROP IT,
YOU'RE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

56:37.828 --> 56:39.797
YOU GOT MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE WATCHING."

56:39.830 --> 56:41.141
SO I THINK I HELD IT
WITH TWO HANDS,

56:41.165 --> 56:42.609
BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT VERY HEAVY AT ALL.

56:42.633 --> 56:44.001
BUT IT IS... IT IS BEAUTIFUL

56:44.034 --> 56:46.971
AND, UH, WE SURE LIKE
THE FOUR THAT WE HAVE

56:47.004 --> 56:50.608
AND THAT'S YOUR GOAL.
AND IT'S A TOUGH GOAL
TO ACHIEVE

56:50.641 --> 56:53.186
'CAUSE THERE ARE 31
OTHER CLUBS OUT THERE
TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING.

56:53.210 --> 56:55.012
BY THE TIME
THE TROPHY IS COMING OUT,

56:55.045 --> 56:57.682
USUALLY WE'RE, LIKE,
DIVVYING UP, YOU KNOW,

56:57.715 --> 56:59.817
OUR WINNINGS OR OUR LOSSES

56:59.850 --> 57:01.986
AND NOT PAYING
A LOT OF ATTENTION

57:02.019 --> 57:04.989
TO THAT SUPER BOWL TROPHY,
BUT I BET THE PLAYERS ARE.

57:05.022 --> 57:07.658
AND I BET WHEN THOSE PLAYERS
GET THAT TROPHY,

57:07.692 --> 57:09.159
AND THEIR WIVES
OR THEIR GIRLFRIENDS

57:09.193 --> 57:11.161
ARE STANDING
JUST OFF THE SIDE,

57:11.195 --> 57:12.897
THEY SAY,
"I WANT MY TROPHY."

58:20.264 --> 58:24.068
GEORGE STEINBRENNER BOUGHT
THE YANKEES IN 1973.

58:24.101 --> 58:27.738
AT THAT TIME, I THINK
THE TOP HAT LOGO
WAS MORE IN USE.

58:27.772 --> 58:30.074
IT ADORNED
EVERY TEAM PUBLICATION,

58:30.107 --> 58:31.909
IT WAS MORE COMMONLY USED.

58:31.942 --> 58:35.179
HE WAS MORE ATTRACTED
TO THE INTERLOCKING "N-Y."

58:35.212 --> 58:37.582
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING
VERY CLASSY ABOUT IT.

58:37.615 --> 58:40.084
SO, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FROM
THE TIME HE OWNED THE TEAM,

58:40.117 --> 58:42.186
THAT WAS THE LOGO OF CHOICE.

58:42.219 --> 58:45.756
TIFFANY HAD DESIGNED
THAT INTERLOCKING "N-Y"

58:45.790 --> 58:49.326
ON A POLICE MEDAL
THAT WAS GIVEN IN 1877

58:49.359 --> 58:52.262
TO A WOUNDED NEW YORK CITY
POLICE OFFICER.

58:52.296 --> 58:54.098
ONE OF THE YANKEES'
TWO OWNERS

58:54.131 --> 58:56.767
IN THEIR FIRST DECADE
OF EXISTENCE

58:56.801 --> 58:58.603
WAS WILLIAM DEVERY,

58:58.636 --> 59:01.972
WHO HAD BEEN CHIEF OF POLICE
OF NEW YORK CITY.

59:02.006 --> 59:06.076
WILLIAM DEVERY PROBABLY KEPT
THAT "N-Y" DESIGN

59:06.110 --> 59:08.779
IN SOME FORM
OF CIRCULATION

59:08.813 --> 59:11.949
AND HE WAS STILL HALF-OWNER
OF THE TEAM IN 1909

59:11.982 --> 59:14.051

ON THE YANKEE UNIFORM.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:07.004
WHEN THE CLOCK
WAS FIRST INSTALLED,
WHY WAS TIFFANY CHOSEN?

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.806
GOT IT. OKAY.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.808
HERE IN
GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL,

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.977
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE
AND TESTIFY

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:17.715
THAT OUR MAGNIFICENT OCTOBER,
STARLIT, ZODIAC CEILING...

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:20.918
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE MADE
OF TIFFANY BLUE

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.352
TO REPRESENT THE SKY...

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:24.354
THAT THERE MAY
BE A CORRELATION.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:26.991
IT'S ONE WE'RE PERFECTLY
WILLING TO ACCEPT.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:30.027
IT'S ALL SURROUNDED
BY THE WORLD'S LARGEST,

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.197
MOST MAGNIFICENT PIECE
OF TIFFANY GLASS,

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.834
THE CLOCK, THAT JUST
IDENTIFIES THIS TERMINAL.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.212
THERE'S BEEN A BILLION MOVIES
MADE ABOUT NEW YORK.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:52.182
EVERY POSSIBLE BUILDING,
STATUE, HAS BEEN IN A MOVIE.

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:53.918
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN
IN A MOVIE.

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:55.295
THAT'S HOW I CONVINCED
MARTY TO DO IT.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.888
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL,
THAT CLOCK,

01:00:57.922 --> 01:01:00.357
THAT FROM THE BACK
THAT CLOCK IS BEAUTIFUL.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.159
AND PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,
DON'T REALLY SEE

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.393
THE CLOCK
THAT I CAME OUT OF

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:05.796
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:07.898
IF YOU'RE GOING
UP PARK AVENUE.

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:11.168
OUR TIFFANY CLOCK,
ALL THE ORIGINAL PARTS
ARE STILL THERE.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:13.070
THE ORIGINAL MOTORS,
THE ORIGINAL GEARS.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:15.740
WITH ALL THESE PIECES
A HUNDRED YEARS OLD,

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:18.242
IT'S ACCURATE
TO WITHIN ONE SECOND

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:22.012
EVERY 1,400,000 YEARS.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:39.296
WELL, I CAN SAY
THAT I WAS THRILLED

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.967
TO READ THE BIOGRAPHY
OF STEVE JOBS

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.435
BECAUSE I HAD NOT REALIZED
THAT STEVE JOBS

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:49.774
HAD APPRECIATED THE DESIGN
AND THE WORK OF LOUIS TIFFANY.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:51.375
ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS
IN THAT BOOK,

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.111
IT DEPICTED STEVE JOBS
SITTING ON THE FLOOR

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:56.446
IN A VIRTUALLY EMPTY
ROOM IN HIS HOME

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.449
WHERE THE ONLY OBJECT
WAS A FLOOR LAMP.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:00.951
WHAT THE BOOK
WENT ON TO SAY

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:02.887
IS THAT HE COULDN'T
FURNISH HIS HOME

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.823
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING THAT MET HIS STANDARDS

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.257
AND THERE YOU HAVE
A TIFFANY LAMP.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.037
HE APPRECIATED
THE BEAUTY IN IT
AND THE CLEANL...

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.471
WHAT HE WAS
TRYING TO SAY.

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:24.541
WELL, TIFFANY WAS ABOUT
BEAUTY, AND HE WAS TOO.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.812
IT WAS ABOUT DESIGN... AND
PERFECT DESIGN.

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:29.413
WHEN YOU THINK
OF THE MAGNOLIA,

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.315
YOU HARKEN BACK
TO NATURE.

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:32.492
AND THEN,
EVEN IF YOU GO FURTHER,

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.151
YOU THINK
OF JAPANESE CULTURE

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.153
BECAUSE TIFFANY
TRAVELLED TREMENDOUSLY

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:37.822
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
AND HE BROUGHT

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.157
MANY OF HIS INFLUENCES
FROM TRAVELING

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.159
INTO HIS DESIGN AESTHETIC.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:45.062
SO YOU CAN RELATE TO IT
IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.832
ONE OF HIS QUOTES WAS
"NATURE IS ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL."

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:50.067
I THINK THAT
WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.402
COLOR WAS
SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.905
HE WAS... HE CONSIDERED
HIMSELF A COLORIST

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:58.542
AND IT COMES THROUGH
IN EVERYTHING THAT WAS MADE.

CHARLES LEWIS TIFFANY DIES,

LOUIS HAS REALLY MASTERED
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FORMS.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.204
AND I THINK THAT
THE JEWELRY REALLY

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.364
IS SUCH A CONTINUATION
OF HIS AESTHETIC.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:22.867
AGAIN, THE EMPHASIS ON COLOR.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.869
THE EMPHASIS ON NATURE.

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:28.038
LOUIS WENT ON TO DO
VERY MUCH THE SAME
AS HIS FATHER DID,

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:29.907
WHICH WAS TO CREATE A BRAND

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:34.044
AND TO OPEN THIS
INCREDIBLE LUXURY, SORT OF,
RETAIL EMPORIUM,

01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:37.381
AND VERY MUCH FOLLOWED
IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.594
THE SIDEWALKS
ALONG FIFTH AVENUE

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:52.562
ARE ALWAYS CROWDED
WITH SHOPPERS.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:58.235
FRAN AND SALLY
DID SOME SHOPPING, TOO.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.370
THEY WERE JUST
WINDOW SHOPPING HERE, THOUGH.

THE WORLD FAMOUS
JEWELRY STORE.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:10.915
WELL, THIS WAS, OF COURSE,
THE SUMMER OF 1945.

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:14.251
AND WE WERE LOOKING
FOR A SUMMER JOB.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:19.256
WE HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN BY
MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT STORES

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:22.426
AND WHEN WE WENT
UP THE AVENUE,

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.263
SUDDENLY... THERE
WE SAW TIFFANY'S.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.265
WE LOVED TO BE
ON THE MAIN FLOOR

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:31.101
BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO WATCH THE DOOR

01:04:31.135 --> 01:04:32.669
FOR ALL THE CELEBRITIES.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:36.473
THAT WAS A DAZZLING MOMENT,
TO SEE JUDY GARLAND.

WHEN SHE WALKED IN
WITH HER NEW HUSBAND,

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:45.282
SHE LOOKED SO HAPPY,
AND TO HEAR THAT FAMOUS LAUGH

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.117
RING THROUGH THE STORE...

01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:49.119
WHO KNOWS WHAT
SHE WAS LAUGHING ABOUT?

01:04:49.153 --> 01:04:53.958
BUT WHAT SHE PURCHASED
AS A GIFT FROM MGM

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:58.062
WERE EMERALDS, WHICH MADE ME
THINK OF "THE WIZARD OF OZ."

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.464
THEY SAID THAT WAS
HER WEDDING PRESENT,

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:05.035

I HAVE TO SAY.

I THINK MY FIRST BLUE BOX

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:29.173
WAS AROUND WHEN
I WAS 12 OR 13.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.840
AND I REMEMBER BEING
RATHER DISAPPOINTED

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:33.676
ON MY 16th BIRTHDAY WHEN
THERE WERE MULTIPLE BLUE BOXES.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.345
AND THERE WAS A LARGE ONE,
AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.682

AND SEE WHAT WAS INSIDE.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.649

THE FIRST BOX THAT I WENT FOR.

AND WHEN I STARTED
OPENING IT UP,

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.886
INSIDE I FOUND
AN ETIQUETTE BOOK.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.522
I THINK MY
FIRST EXPOSURE WAS

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:49.158
THE TIFFANY'S ETIQUETTE BOOK
FOR TEENAGERS.

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:51.161
I CAME TO THE U.S.
WHEN I WAS EIGHT OR NINE,

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.464
SO WE WEREN'T SO WELL-SCHOOLED
ON AMERICAN ETIQUETTE.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.566
THEY WERE LIKE,
"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK
TO LEARN FROM."

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.667
BEYOND CHOPSTICKS.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.669
MY FIRST MEMORY OF TIFFANY'S

01:08:59.703 --> 01:09:01.738
IS... THEY HAVE
AN ETIQUETTE GUIDE
FOR TEENAGERS...

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.773
"TIFFANY'S TABLE MANNERS
FOR TEENAGERS."

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.375
I REMEMBER THE CHRISTMAS.

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:07.544
I WAS PROBABLY 13,
MAYBE 14 AT THE TIME.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.889
AN ETIQUETTE BOOK ISN'T
WHAT EVERY TEENAGER WANTS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.881
I THINK IT'S SUCH AN ICONIC,
RESPECTED AMERICAN BRAND

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.951
SO, I THINK PARENTS
MIGHT THINK

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.554
THAT'S IT'S A GREAT THING
TO GIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.899
- [SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT
OF A DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT... -
DIRECTOR] THE ETIQUETTE BOOK?

01:09:20.924 --> 01:09:22.559
YES,
THE TIFFANY ETIQUETTE BOOK.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.828
BUT APPARENTLY, I GUESS
I LEARNED A FEW THINGS FROM IT.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.563
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL
I WAS OLDER

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.399
WHEN I REALIZED THAT
I'M GONNA MOVE TO NEW YORK,

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:30.899
IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT
IN THE BIG CITY,

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:33.403
I SHOULD KNOW
WHICH ONE IS A SALAD FORK,

01:09:33.437 --> 01:09:35.238
WHICH ONE
IS THE SOUP SPOON.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:38.341
AND SO, I FOUND MYSELF,
SNEAKILY, STEALTHILY,

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:40.844
LOOKING FOR THAT BOOK
AND READING A FEW CHAPTERS.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.613
AND I ACTUALLY JUST
BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON,

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.615
AND HE'S NINE,
AND WE WERE AT BREAKFAST

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.283
AND I GAVE IT TO HIM
AND HE LOOKED AT IT.

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:49.419
AND HE LOOKED AT ME,
HE GOES,

01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:51.755
"MY NAME IS NOT TIFFANY
AND I'M NOT A TEENAGER.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.758
HERE YOU GO,
YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK."

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:58.928
I WAS SUPER LUCKY
THAT FOR ONE OF MY BIRTHDAYS

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:02.566

CAPTURED ME, BLINDFOLDED ME...

WONDERFUL BREAKFAST FOR ME.

AND I WAS IN HEAVEN.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.179
THE IDEA OF JEWELRY,

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:46.282
AND TO SUCCEED
AS A JEWELRY DESIGNER,

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:50.654
I THINK IS SOMETHING
THAT EVEN CLOTHING DESIGNERS
HAVE ASPIRATIONS FOR.

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:53.990
THE YEAR MONIQUE PEAN WON,
SHE WAS A RUNNER-UP WINNER

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:57.827
SHE WON $100,000
AND HER CHOICE OF MENTOR.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:14:59.729
WENT INTO
ANNA WINTOUR'S OFFICE

01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:01.565
AND SHE SAID IF YOU COULD
HAVE ANY MENTOR,

01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:02.932
WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:04.610
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW
IF I COULD HAVE ANYONE,

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:06.570
I WOULD LOVE
TO BE ABLE TO WORK

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:08.705
WITH MICHAEL KOWALSKI,
THE CEO OF TIFFANY."

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.608
WHAT INTRIGUED ME OF COURSE,
WAS HER INTENSE INTEREST

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:13.710
IN THE MATERIALS
THAT SHE USES.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:16.145
AND HER COMMITMENT
TO... TO SUSTAINABILITY

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:18.047
NOT ONLY
IN TERMS OF MATERIALS,

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.649
BUT IN TERMS OF THE FOLKS

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.017
WHO PROVIDE THOSE MATERIALS.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.620
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
A... A WONDERFUL STORY,

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.889
AND I THINK IT'S RELEVANT
FOR LUXURY TODAY.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.624
RATHER THAN
TAKING FROM THE EARTH,

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.893
FINDING THINGS
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT,

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:31.595
FOSSILS ARE SO INCREDIBLE
BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:33.697
ALMOST LIKE NATURE'S
PHOTOGRAPHS.

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.965
AND THAT THEY'RE ABLE
TO TELL A STORY THROUGH TIME.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.702
AND I USE A LOT
OF FOSSILIZED WOOLLY MAMMOTH

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:40.136
AND FOSSILIZED
DINOSAUR BONE.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:41.838
THIS IS FOSSILIZED
WOOLLY MAMMOTH,

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.039
THE CREAM PARTS

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.283
THAT HAVE BEEN
TRAPPED IN THE ICE

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.776
OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.813
AND THEN IN THE CENTER
IS FOSSILIZED WOOLLY MAMMOTH

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.147
THE ROOT OF THE TOOTH

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.583
AND THE SALT MINERALS
OVER 35,000 YEARS

01:15:53.617 --> 01:15:55.284
CHANGED THE COLOR
TO THESE DEEP BLUES.

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:57.887
AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE
IS FOSSILIZED DINOSAUR BONE.

01:15:57.921 --> 01:15:59.122
THAT'S FROM
THE JURASSIC PERIOD

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:01.124
AND 150 MILLION YEARS OLD.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:03.126
IN JEWELRY DESIGNING,

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:05.929
TALENTED NEW ARTISTS LIKE
JEAN SCHLUMBERGER

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:07.363
ORIGINATED LABYRINTH IDEAS,

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.232
WHICH ARE THE DESPAIR
OF MANUFACTURERS

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.300
WHO SERVE THE MASS MARKET.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.172
I LOVE THE, UM...

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.741
ONE OF MY FAVORITES
IS THE... SHIT.

01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:18.984
I CAN... CAN NEVER
PRONOUNCE HIM.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.343
"SCHLUM... SUMBERGER."

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:22.378
- "SCHLUM-BER-JAY."
- SCHLUMBERGER. MM-HMM.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.780
YUP, MAKE THEM JEWISH.

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:26.215
"SCHLUM-BURGER."

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.985
"SCHLUM-BURGER?"
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S
SO EMBARRASSING.

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:31.254
YOU CORRECTED HER, RIGHT?

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:34.624
I MEAN, YOU GOT...
OF COURSE, THE...

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:36.793
OH, MY GOD,
WHY AM I THINKING
OF "CHO-BA-JAY"?

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.695
"SHOW-BA-JAY."
I'M SAYING IT WRONG.

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:40.930
- WELL, IT'S LIKE...
- IT'S CLOSE.

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.733
- "SCHLUM-BER-JAY." -AND THEY BROUGHT
OUT THE BROACH, AND THEY SAID,

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:44.834
"THIS IS "SCHLUM-BER-JAY."

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.269
IS THAT HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED?

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:47.871
- WELL, IT'S LIKE...
- IT'S CLOSE.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.673
- "SCHLUM-BER-JAY."
- SCHLUMBERGER.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.074
"SEAN... SCHLUMBERGER."

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.209
THE SCHLUMBERGER...

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.111
THESE ARE HEIRLOOMS.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:17:00.349
THESE ARE FAMILY HEIRLOOMS,
AND THEY ARE FROM THE 1940'S.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.951
THEY'RE EARLY SCHLUMBERGER.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:04.020
I LOVE
THE SCHLUMBERGER PIECES.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:05.655
WHENEVER I GO IN
TO THE TIFFANY STORE,

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:06.856
THAT'S WHERE I GO AND JUST

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.725
SORT OF
PET THE CABINETS AND...

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:11.327

SCHLUMBERGER PIECES
THAT I BOUGHT.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:42.358
HE REALLY WAS ATTRACTED
TO THEMES IN NATURE.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.893
WHAT HE'S MOST KNOWN FOR

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:45.428
ARE THE SCHLUMBERGER
ENAMEL BRACELETS.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:46.863

I USED TO READ

ELIZABETH TAYLOR,
MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH JEWELRY."

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.144
IT WAS
MY VERY FAVORITE PIECE

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.779
IN THE BOOK,
AND I THOUGHT

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:04.113
I ALWAYS WANTED IT,

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.849
AND THEN WHEN THIS CAME UP
FOR AUCTION...

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:08.217
I THINK IT WENT
FOR ABOUT $1 MILLION.

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:10.754
- YES.
- $550,000 THEN, AND SELLING.

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.756

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:15.424

I THOUGHT,
"WELL, I'M NEVER GONNA GET

THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR ONE."

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:28.872
AND SO, I GOT THIS
AND I THINK IT WAS...

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:31.307
DON'T QUOTE ME.
LIKE $60,000 OR $70,000.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.484

WE TRY AND RECREATE.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.037
SOME DESIGNS
WERE NEVER MADE.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.472
SOME SKETCHES
WERE ONLY PART-SKETCHED.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.508
AND SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO GUESS.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:07.376
BUT IT'S ALL IN

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.878
THERE'S NOTHING

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:12.181
THAT'S BEING ADAPTED
OR CHANGED.

-DIAMONDS...
ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.
-ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND,

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.987

TO SPARKLE THAN ON OSCAR'S?

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.889
THANK GOODNESS.

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:21.958
THANK GOODNESS
FOR TIFFANY AND CO.

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:23.059
LOOK AT THIS.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.060
LOOK HOW GORGEOUS.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.461
TO DIE.

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:27.230
- AND BY THE WAY...
- YOU CAN'T TAKE IT...

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.303
- THIS IS ONE
OF HER FAVORITE PIECES.
- FROM HER.

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:31.076
I KNOW, WELL WE BROUGHT THAT
AFTER SHE WAS, UH...

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.444
- YEAH, SHE WAS...
- SHE WENT RIGHT TO THAT

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:33.903
AND WAS
REALLY DRAWN TO THAT.

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.347
YEAH, SHE'LL BE
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.940
- SO, WE WANTED TO MAKE... -AND SO
AM I.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:38.541
WHICH WE, OF COURSE,
ARE ALSO PARTIAL TO

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:41.244
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE
TO THE TIFFANY BLUE COLOR.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.511
OH, RIGHT, GOT IT.

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:45.414
JESSICA BIEL HERE
ON THE RED CARPET.

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.316
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
THERE YOU ARE.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.052
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M WELL, THANK YOU.

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:50.595
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.921
SO, TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR DRESS.

01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:53.522
LET'S START WITH
THE E! FASHION.

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:54.590
- OKAY.
- YES.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.492
- THIS IS CHANEL COUTURE.
- MM-HMM.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.494
AND I'M BASICALLY
JUST DECKED

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:01.097
- HEAD TO TOE IN TIFFANY'S.
- YOU'VE GOT ARM CANDY

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.498
BUT NOT
YOUR OTHER ARM CANDY.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:03.933
- HE'S OUT ON TOUR, ISN'T HE?
- YES.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.235
YES, OUT ON TOUR,
BUSY WORKING.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:07.470
I'M WATCHING IT ON TV

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:10.139
WITH PR'S
AND OTHER STYLISTS.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:11.507
- YEAH.
- WITH OTHER STYLISTS?

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.909
YEAH, I HAVE
A COUPLE STYLISTS

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.110
I'M FRIENDS WITH
IN L.A.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.444
SO WE USUALLY
WATCH IT TOGETHER.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:18.547
OH, IT'S SO MEAN.
IT'S AWESOME.

01:20:18.581 --> 01:20:21.885
EVERYBODY'S TRASHING EVERYBODY
EXCEPT THEIR CLIENTS.

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:24.988
- EVERYONE? REALLY?
- YEAH, YOU HAVE TO BE
REALLY CAREFUL.

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.289
LET'S JUST GET IT
ON THE TABLE,

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.224
WHO DID WHO,
AND LET'S ALL BE NICE.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.062
YEAH, I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU WATCH THE OSCARS?

01:20:33.096 --> 01:20:35.064
YOU COMMENT ON
WHAT EVERYBODY'S WEARING.

01:20:35.098 --> 01:20:41.637
YOU KNOW? AND IT'S... IT'S A
GREAT, FUN TV MOMENT.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:45.408
OH, IT'S AMAZING.
I'M A GREAT COMMENTATOR.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.410
- AND I DO HAVE...
- YOU'RE A HATER, TOO?

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:50.079
I AM NOT A HATER.
IT'S NOT FROM HATE.

01:20:50.113 --> 01:20:54.583
IT'S FROM THE DESIRE
TO NOT BE MEDIOCRE

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:58.254
AND TO REALLY HAVE
INCREDIBLE STYLE.

01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:02.258
AND TO TAKE ALL THESE
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.660
PIECES AND THINGS
THAT PEOPLE ARE CREATING

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.595
AND TO REALLY
CELEBRATE THEM.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.564
AND NOT IN A SILLY WAY.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:11.267
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN
THEY DID CELEBRATE BEAUTY,

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.270
I MEAN, WHEN LIZ TAYLOR
WON AN AWARD,

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:16.906
LIZ WAS FABULOUS
AND I WOULD HOPE

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.908
THAT WE WOULD
GET BACK TO THAT DAY.

01:21:18.942 --> 01:21:20.309
'CAUSE THOSE
WERE INCREDIBLE DAYS.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.615
AT HOLLYWOOD'S
PANTAGES THEATRE

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:29.152
IT'S THE MOTION PICTURE
INDUSTRY'S NIGHT OF NIGHTS,

01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:31.620
AND THE FILM CAPITAL'S
TOP STARS TURN OUT

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:36.092
FOR THE ANNUAL PRESENTATION
OF THE COVETED OSCARS.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.062
JESSICA! JESS!

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:44.968
JESSICA, I NEED THOSE EYES!

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:50.473
THE RIGHT PIECE

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:52.308
ON THE RIGHT CELEBRITY

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:55.644
IS THE BEST P.R.

01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:57.981
YOU CAN'T BUY THAT P.R.

01:21:58.014 --> 01:22:02.051
IT'S, UH, A PHOTOGRAPH
THAT IS SEEN WORLDWIDE.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:06.055
UM, ONE PHOTOGRAPH
IS PICKED UP
BY COUNTLESS BLOGS

01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:09.092
AND YOU ARE FOCUSING
ON THAT JEWELRY.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:11.160
THE DRESS, YES,
BUT THE JEWELRY

01:22:11.194 --> 01:22:12.996
REALLY MAKES
THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:15.331
AND THE ACCESSORIES
REALLY MAKE THAT OUTFIT.

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.500
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:20.336
THE DRESS IS EASILY
KNOCKED OFF.

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:23.339
THE JEWELRY IS PRICELESS,
IT'S INVALUABLE.

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:24.974
AND PEOPLE KNOW
THAT JEWELER.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:15.391
IT'S LIKE... IT REMINDS ME

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:16.725
OF MINERAL IN THE OCEAN.

01:23:16.759 --> 01:23:19.028
IT'S DIFFERENT
'CAUSE...

01:23:19.062 --> 01:23:20.496
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MOTTO.

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:22.698
JEWELRY STORES DON'T REALLY
HAVE A THEME

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.733
TO WHAT THEY DO.

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:27.403
BESIDES TIFFANY,
NO OTHER STORES

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:31.740
REALLY HAVE, LIKE,
A THEME TO THEIR JEWELRY.
IT'S ALL JUST TROPICAL.

01:23:31.774 --> 01:23:37.246
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU WANT TO WEAR A DIAMOND.
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO WEAR...

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.582
WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND YOU GET
DIVORCED, LIKE, FIVE TIMES,

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:41.326
YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T NEED
ANY OF THAT STUFF.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.186
WELL, ULTIMATELY,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.787

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:49.292
HOW IT IS THIS POP-CULTURE
KIND OF... CIRCULAR WEIRDNESS.

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:51.294

01:23:51.327 --> 01:23:53.496
- DO THEY REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.265

YOU PASS ON THE STREET

01:23:56.299 --> 01:23:58.101

LIKE, IT MAKES ME
SICK TO MY STOMACH.

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:47.210
THEY WERE IN TISSUE,
AND SHE CLEANED HER ROOM

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:49.354
AND LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND SAID,
"I THINK I THREW THEM OUT."

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.614
