10:52.753 --> 10:53.720
If you wanna be a good reporter

10:53.754 --> 10:56.122
you’re gonna have
to change your tactics.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.059
I put on a clean pair
this morning.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.329
No, I mean,
you’re gonna have to find

11:03.363 --> 11:05.899
new ways o‐of
getting your information.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.368
If someone won’t talk to you,
talk to their friends

11:08.401 --> 11:10.837
talk to their wives,
talk to their ex‐wives.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.305
Well, what if
they’re not married

11:12.338 --> 11:14.240
and they don’t have
any friends?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.142
Well, then you have
to hang out in places

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
where you think
you can pick up information.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.981
Uh, water cooler,
the lobby, the snack bar.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.717
Who knows?
You might have to go incognito.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.351
Oh, I don’t know, cousin.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.954
I don’t care much
for Mexican food.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.995
It always gives me
Monty Hall’s revenge.

11:43.103 --> 11:47.307
No, I mean, you might
have to wear a disguise.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.142
But, but, cousin, t‐that sounds

11:49.175 --> 11:51.344
an awful lot like snooping.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.346
It’s not snooping
if you’re writing it down.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.849
Then, it’s journalism.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.185
Oh‐h‐h!

11:59.219 --> 12:02.088
Well, I’ve got to get this up
to Mr. Wainwright’s office.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.356
Good luck with your newsletter.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.258
Thanks.
Can I, can I push the button?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.993
Alright, you push the button.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.896
Oh! Oh! And don’t forget...

12:14.300 --> 12:15.802
Bye‐bye.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.541
No. No, not bye‐bye.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.277
Quotes. Quotes.
Always get exact quotes.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.446
Oh, right. Right, right, right.
Quotes. Quotes.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.850
‐Oh, hi, guys.
‐Hi, Ms. Lydia.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.385
Wainwright’s still running you
around like a madman, Larry?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.154
Lydia, would you believe
this is the third time

12:34.187 --> 12:36.022
he’s had me rewrite
this murder story?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.391
He said I mentioned murder
too many times.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.828
If you ask me, Mr. Wainwright
is not playing with a full deck.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.503
"Mr. Wainwright is not playing
with a full deck."

12:52.138 --> 12:53.974
What a great...

12:54.975 --> 12:57.911
[instrumental music]

13:01.948 --> 13:04.918
[instrumental music]

13:11.958 --> 13:14.494
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

13:14.528 --> 13:16.930
Get your copy
of the "Chronicle Chatter"

13:16.963 --> 13:19.165
under new management.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.134
‐Here you go, cousin.
‐Ah.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.235
Thank you, Balki.

13:23.236 --> 13:27.340
It’s, it’s, it’s hot
off the presses.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.042
I’ll get to it later.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.545
Read it before
they wrap fish in it.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.616
I guess you want me
to read this now.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.283
Only if you have time.

13:38.552 --> 13:41.321
I’ll make the time.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.289
I was hoping to read
this before you went to press

13:43.323 --> 13:44.224
but I’ve been so busy.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.092
Eh, cousin,
it’s okay, it’s okay.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.961
We both had papers to put out.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.030
[laughing]

13:50.063 --> 13:52.866
Oh, Bartokomous,
I have got to admit it.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.968
This is the best thing
I have seen in years.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.036
Thank you, Mr. Gorpley.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.971
Well, didn’t I tell you
people would love it?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.640
Well, I’m overcome!

13:59.673 --> 14:02.643
But I can’t take all the credit.
Cousin Larry helped too.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.647
Well, whoever wrote the story
about Lydia did a great job.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.449
Well, you’re lookin’
right through him.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.520
I mean, everybody thought
she went to the Bahamas

14:13.554 --> 14:15.956
but you found out
she really went to Milwaukee

14:15.989 --> 14:17.357
to have an eyelid tuck.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.926
[laughing]

14:19.960 --> 14:21.862
Nice going, Bartokomous!

14:22.663 --> 14:23.930
Excuse me?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.065
Yeah, well, it’s right next

14:25.098 --> 14:26.633
to the Dimitri,
the sheep cartoon.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.134
Oh, hmm.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.003
That’s going to be
a regular feature.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.007
I thought maybe later on I could
give it a political angle.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.110
"If you’re wondering who had
what done where the answer is

14:37.143 --> 14:39.245
"Ms. Lydia, the paper’s
favorite advice columnist

14:39.279 --> 14:41.548
"went to Milwaukee
to get her eyelids tucked.

14:41.582 --> 14:43.283
"When? Over the weekend.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.218
"So if you get a chance,
compliment her

14:45.251 --> 14:48.021
on her new peeper‐covers."

14:48.054 --> 14:50.023
[chuckles]

14:50.056 --> 14:51.491
How many of these
have you given out?

14:51.525 --> 14:53.660
One to every employee
in the building

14:53.694 --> 14:56.563
and I left a complimentary pile
in the lobby.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.301
Okay, get your coat!
We’re getting out of here.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.503
‐What?
‐Come on!

15:02.536 --> 15:03.604
Huh?

15:07.073 --> 15:10.276
I want some answers
and I want them now!

15:10.310 --> 15:13.079
Lydia, I’m sure everything
can be explained.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
I have been humiliated!

15:15.148 --> 15:19.219
Held up to ridicule in front
of everyone in the building!

15:19.252 --> 15:22.088
Who did this to you, Ms. Lydia?

15:24.357 --> 15:27.060
They’ll have to answer to me!

15:27.093 --> 15:29.462
Chill out, Lydia. I thought
the article was hilarious.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.531
Peeper‐covers.

15:30.564 --> 15:31.632
[laughing]

15:34.635 --> 15:37.070
You are pretty cheerful
for a man

15:37.103 --> 15:39.673
who doesn’t have long to live.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.741
What are you talking about?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.977
The article
about you and Maggie.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.245
The what?

15:46.647 --> 15:48.414
You mean, there’s another?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.450
Oh, didn’t you read
the last page?

15:50.483 --> 15:53.286
It’s equally hilarious.

15:53.319 --> 15:57.090
Thank you very much. I, I do
try to accent the lighter side.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.492
"Sam Gorpley,
looking very handsome

15:59.526 --> 16:02.295
"in a pickled herring
bone suit...

16:07.100 --> 16:09.002
"...was seen dining with who?

16:09.035 --> 16:12.238
"Maggie Miner,
wife of sports editor

16:12.272 --> 16:15.642
"and bodybuilder
Matt Miner, that’s who.

16:15.676 --> 16:19.445
"Apparently Maggie has a sore
knee because Mr. Gorpley

16:19.479 --> 16:22.315
was nice enough
to rub it all during lunch."

16:28.121 --> 16:29.455
I’m a dead man.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.294
But I’m taking somebody with me.

16:35.796 --> 16:38.264
Oh! Okay, okay, uh, Balki.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.666
[laughing]
They fell for it!

16:39.700 --> 16:42.335
Let’s let them in
on our little joke.

16:42.368 --> 16:46.072
There are only two copies of
the newsletter and you got them.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.207
[laughing]

16:48.675 --> 16:50.777
They’re all over the building.

16:50.811 --> 16:54.380
Balki, I cannot believe that
you would write stuff like this.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.183
You know,
I can hardly believe it myself.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.323
I was afraid my writing would be
flat and pedestrian but...

17:04.625 --> 17:06.693
...I just followed exactly

17:06.727 --> 17:09.730
what Cousin Larry
told me to do and...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.601
You can see the results.

17:14.635 --> 17:16.269
But I, I didn’t help that much.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.204
Oh, come on, cousin,
you’re being modest.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.473
No, no! Listen,
the, the truth must be told.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.175
Oh, I don’t know.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.613
You see,
I was just going to write

17:26.646 --> 17:28.649
that Ms. Lydia
went to the Bahamas

17:28.682 --> 17:30.283
but Cousin Larry
kept saying no

17:30.316 --> 17:32.252
you got to d‐i‐i‐ig
a little deeper.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.154
(Balki)
’You got to dig
a little deeper.’

17:34.187 --> 17:35.556
No, no! I‐I‐I didn’t, I didn’t.

17:35.589 --> 17:37.390
See, he couldn’t...
He, he couldn’t. I only...

17:37.423 --> 17:38.659
Appleton!

17:38.692 --> 17:40.561
Yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright!

17:41.795 --> 17:43.564
Yes, sir. Yes, w‐what
can I do for you, sir?

17:43.597 --> 17:45.666
Research? Filing?
Out‐of‐town assignment?

17:45.699 --> 17:48.835
Explain this article
in the "Chronicle Chatter."

17:48.869 --> 17:51.171
Oh, no, another one?

17:51.204 --> 17:53.373
"If you’re wondering
what Mr. Wainwright might like

17:53.406 --> 17:54.875
"in his Christmas stocking,
might I suggest

17:54.908 --> 17:56.309
"a pack of playing cards.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.878
"And why would
this be the ideal gift?

17:57.911 --> 18:00.280
"Because, according
to Cousin Larry Appleton

18:00.313 --> 18:02.616
Mr. Wainwright isn’t playing
with a full deck."

18:07.888 --> 18:12.358
Uh, uh, uh...a full deck
i‐isn’t that a nautical term?

18:14.327 --> 18:17.698
Mr. Wainwright, one less thing
to ask Santa for, huh?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.334
I‐it was a mistake.
It, it wasn’t me.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.904
I, I would never say anything
like that about you, sir.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.405
I, I must have been misquoted.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.873
No, cousin,
I was standing right...

18:26.907 --> 18:28.742
No, no, no,
you taught me!

18:28.775 --> 18:31.177
I was standing
right there and I caught

18:31.211 --> 18:34.347
the exact quote
as it flew out of your mouth.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.449
It was, it was
taken out of context!

18:36.482 --> 18:39.185
It was, i‐i‐it had to be...
Have you lost weight?

18:39.219 --> 18:42.656
Because that’s a very nice suit.
I‐i‐it matches your head.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.290
Your hair.
The hair on your head.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.358
‐Appleton,
‐Yes, sir?

18:45.391 --> 18:46.793
‐You’re babbling.
‐Thank you, sir.

18:46.827 --> 18:50.263
Appleton,
when you’re coherent, call me.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.165
You bet I will, sir.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.705
Mr. Wainwright
and Mr. Gorpley in fashion war.

18:58.739 --> 19:00.273
Check it out!

19:05.512 --> 19:06.913
I’m Matt Miner.

19:06.947 --> 19:09.182
And I’m looking for Sam Gorpley.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.385
(Lydia and Gorpley)
That’s him!

19:12.418 --> 19:13.453
Oh.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.596
[instrumental music]

19:22.629 --> 19:24.297
(Larry)
’Yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright.’

19:24.330 --> 19:27.400
Totally.
Totally, totally uncalled for.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.869
Yes...y‐yes, but...

19:28.902 --> 19:30.871
I really meant that about
the weight loss, though.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.406
You’re, you’re looking,
you’re looking very very...

19:33.439 --> 19:35.876
Hello? Hello? Hello?

19:37.778 --> 19:39.412
Balki, good news.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.981
I’m off the hook
with Wainwright.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.216
He was very gracious.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.842
Balki, how long
do you plan on wearing

20:08.875 --> 20:12.278
the Myposian Mantle
of a Thousand Itches?

20:14.715 --> 20:18.852
Well, Myposian law
states I must wear it

20:18.885 --> 20:23.657
one year for every person I
offended and let me see...

20:24.891 --> 20:27.427
...I offended seven people,
so...

20:28.695 --> 20:31.632
...I think we’re looking
at a seven year itch.

20:37.037 --> 20:41.474
Balki, I really think you’re
carrying this a little too far.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.976
No, no, cousin.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.612
If I was carrying this
too far...

20:45.646 --> 20:48.715
...I’d be wearing the
Boxer Shorts of Eternal Chafing.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.923
Balki, in America
when you offend someone

20:56.957 --> 21:00.460
a verbal apology is sufficient.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.896
Unless you offend a large
segment of the population

21:02.929 --> 21:05.398
uh, then you get
a Presidential pardon.

21:08.502 --> 21:12.639
You mean, if I, if I write
everyone I offended

21:12.673 --> 21:15.609
a verbal apology,
I’ll be okay?

21:16.510 --> 21:17.944
In a manner of speaking.

21:17.978 --> 21:20.881
Well, then I think I’ll do that.

21:20.914 --> 21:22.949
Okay, well,
let’s, let’s take this off.

21:22.983 --> 21:24.050
Ah!

21:27.921 --> 21:28.989
[grunts]

21:31.525 --> 21:32.593
[sighs]

21:34.961 --> 21:36.029
Wool.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.901
A‐after I deliver
all my apologies...

21:40.934 --> 21:43.570
...I‐I’ll, I’ll resign
from the newsletter.

21:43.604 --> 21:45.371
Balki, you don’t have
to do that.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.108
‐You did a good job.
‐I did?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.677
Yeah, the first newsletter
you wrote was pretty good.

21:50.711 --> 21:54.047
All it needed
was a little fine tuning.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.649
And I’m sure
you’ll do a terrific job

21:55.682 --> 21:58.051
if I stay out of your way.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.554
Cousin,
would you do that for me?

22:04.057 --> 22:05.425
You bet I would.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.860
Thank you, cousin.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.428
I just have one question.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.632
How did you find out about
Gorpley’s lunch date

22:11.665 --> 22:12.866
with Maggie Miner?

22:12.899 --> 22:15.536
Oh, I, I followed
your suggestion

22:15.569 --> 22:18.572
and I went undercover.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.074
[American accent]
Hi, my name’s Bart,
I’ll be your waiter today.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.442
Uh...

22:25.145 --> 22:27.113
Let me just, uh, put
your drink order in real quick

22:27.147 --> 22:28.815
and then I’ll be back
to explain our specials

22:28.849 --> 22:30.951
