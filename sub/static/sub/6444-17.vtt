00:59.680 --> 01:00.829
You're late.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.558
Was there a problem
with the cash?

01:04.720 --> 01:08.076
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.958
You don't know my roommate.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.677
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.270
No worries, Lana,
we're just about fixed for your fix.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.398
This is not a drug trip.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.996
Relax, Lance,
just a little syringe-speak humor.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.230
I wasn't implying
that it's a hallucination.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.400
Damn straight. This little cocktail
is my lock on a Nobel Prize.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.792
And a big fat deal
with the pharmaceutical company.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.872
I wanna stay down longer this time.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.957
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.988
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.630
It's only 20 seconds longer
than last time, and I almost found them.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.199
What could it hurt?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.312
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.271
Mom. Dad. Oh, my God.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.273
I never thought I'd see you again.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.150
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.678
I've just been so confused,
I didn't know where to turn.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.391
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.548
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.829
No! No! No...

03:14.360 --> 03:18.319
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.114
Back among the living.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.840
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.358
Wait. It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.110
Clark? We've got a problem.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.597
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's <i>urgent...</i>

04:58.760 --> 05:01.513
...you rip in here without the least regard
for my privacy.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.389
- I didn't wanna disturb you.
- Don't worry, Lana's not here.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.836
Actually,
she didn't come home at all last night.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.591
It's not another guy. She's been
hanging out with these med students...

05:12.760 --> 05:14.716
...and they keep really wicked hours.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.793
But you know, Clark, it will happen.
Eventually she will find someone else.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.997
Yeah, she deserves to be happy.
What's our crisis?

05:22.160 --> 05:24.720
Mass destruction and death
in Central America.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.475
And the possibility that your former
professor, Milton Fine, is involved.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.791
- No, he's dead.
- I know we thought we saw him die.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.871
But the only thing
we're really sure <i>of...</i>

05:34.040 --> 05:37.589
...is that he disappeared,
and so did that ship.

05:49.320 --> 05:53.154
- Where'd you get this?
- A source tipped me off.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.918
- Catch you later, Lana.
- Yeah.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.189
I'll call you later.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.349
- Sorry.
- You guys are friends.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.750
It was bound to happen sometime,
right?

06:34.640 --> 06:36.835
I didn't think you'd be back.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.231
So should I even bother asking
what you were up to last night?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.039
Just hanging out, Chloe,
it was no big deal.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.672
Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like
all nighters agree with you.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.877
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.996
Because you don't look okay.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.397
Lana, I know that clark's breakup's
been really difficult, but...

06:59.560 --> 07:02.870
chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right? People break up every day.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.110
It's not a big deal. I'll get over it.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.598
In short, this minor tax increase...

07:55.760 --> 07:58.149
...can make a major difference
in our public schools.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.834
Senator, how do you feel
about clayton's <i>allegations...</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:03.719
...that your proposal will drain money
from constituents...

08:03.880 --> 08:05.199
...failing to help schools?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.397
I'd be more than happy to respond
to the congressman's <i>concerns...</i>

08:08.560 --> 08:11.120
...should Congressman Clayton
care to ask me in person.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.989
- Thank you very much for coming.
- Well, thank you, senator.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.392
Nice strategy, senator.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.150
When attacked, don't hesitate,
come out fighting.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.039
I meant what I said.
A public debate is what I'm hoping for.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.316
I'd hate to have to go through this
every time.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.951
You won't. It'll get easier once you've
made it clear you're a player.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.190
I've... I brought you something.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.875
Something that just might
give you a bit of an edge.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.270
We're both going to that dinner
tomorrow night...

08:43.440 --> 08:47.877
<i>...at</i> the governor's mansion.
A copy of my research.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.793
Everything there is to know
about our dinner companions.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.190
Believe it or not, Lionel,
I've done my homework.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.352
I know each person's position
and what their voting record is.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.636
What I don't know is
why you're doing this.

09:01.360 --> 09:06.150
I am not trying to manipulate your vote,
Martha. Look at it.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.589
- Congressman Clayton plays polo?
- His passion.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.952
- His daughter's a gymnast.
- Olympic standard.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.953
Look, it may be a political function,
but in my experience...

09:22.120 --> 09:25.510
...the last thing anyone wants to do
over dinner is talk shop.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.036
Just... It's another way
to connect with your colleagues.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.997
Why don't we go together
tomorrow night?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.628
I'll help you navigate
the rough waters.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.471
Thank you.

09:38.920 --> 09:44.199
But, Lionel, I hope you're not
expecting something on a personal level.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.232
The two of us will never be
anything more than friends.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.230
I understand.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.472
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.512
Can I see that?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.711
Between the two is the labrum,
or articular cartilage.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.714
Divide the deltoid and its attachments,
then you'll cut through the humerus.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.111
Okay, you need to come through
the bone two inches below the joint.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.271
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?

11:06.880 --> 11:08.108
I have to do it again soon.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.794
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.190
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.672
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.831
All right, but it's gonna cost you.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.391
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.035
Don't move.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.713
Lana?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.433
My God, Lana, l...

12:30.600 --> 12:33.592
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.070
If you needed money,
all you had to do was ask.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.198
I know. Lex, I'm really sorry.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.314
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.948
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.919
You didn't wanna lie to me,
but you broke into my house...

12:57.080 --> 12:58.752
...and tried to steal from me.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.560
You're acting like a junkie
trying to find her next fix.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.468
There's this guy at school.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.679
- He's created these chemicals.
- So it is drugs.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.477
No. It's not what you think.

13:18.640 --> 13:22.428
They kill you,
and then they bring you back.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.036
Lex, I died. I died and I came back.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.110
I'm telling the truth.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.355
I went to the other side...

13:37.120 --> 13:38.917
...and I saw my parents.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.393
It was beautiful.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.077
No one understands the loss of a parent
more than I do.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.355
And for you,
growing up without a mother or father...

14:10.200 --> 14:13.715
...I can even understand taking whatever
chance you did to see them again.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.599
But you have to look at yourself.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.871
Look at what you've become.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.518
This isn't what your parents
would have wanted for you.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.476
Lex, I'm sorry. I just...

14:30.640 --> 14:33.552
I wanted to see them so badly.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.598
I'm just so alone.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.034
I think maybe it's <i>time...</i>

14:41.200 --> 14:45.671
...we both stop trying to hold on
to the people we've <i>lost...</i>

14:46.800 --> 14:50.395
...and start turning to the ones
we still have in our lives.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.589
Yeah, I think you're right.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.955
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.270
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.475
- Senor Fine?
- Senor Fine.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.919
Hello?

15:57.080 --> 15:58.638
Lex?

16:00.320 --> 16:03.710
No. No, I don't know where she is,
but I can find out.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.269
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.238
We need to talk.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.039
Lana warned us
her roommate was nosy.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.475
You look worse than Lana.

16:37.880 --> 16:43.796
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady
on me? Bring me some chicken soup?

16:43.960 --> 16:47.396
No. I'm here because
I'm worried about my friend.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.189
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.433
The last thing she needs is to flunk out
of school because she's out partying.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.632
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.439
If you don't tell me
what you guys are taking all night...

17:03.600 --> 17:05.670
<i>...I'll</i> make it
the university's business too.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.115
Chill. Lana hasn't been <i>partying...</i>

17:08.280 --> 17:11.431
<i>...and</i> she isn't moping around,
mourning her high-school sweetheart.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.590
Well,
she isn't exactly acting like herself.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.877
The two of you look like poster children
for the Betty Ford Clinic.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.238
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.039
No. What is she taking? Drugs?

17:25.839 --> 17:29.469
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.834
Came to you for what?

17:31.480 --> 17:35.393
That's between Lana
and her loved ones.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.238
Alley, what is it? What's happening?

17:45.240 --> 17:47.959
Near-death experience.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.919
It's a compound, meteor rock.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.195
Oh, my God.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.312
I need an ambulance, please. It's an
emergency. At Poss House, room 1170.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.914
Please, I don't wanna die.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.152
Oh, God.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.992
Lance?

18:47.640 --> 18:50.518
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.395
Evidence?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.995
Alley, she's dead.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.834
What? What happened to her?

19:00.320 --> 19:04.154
I warned her there's only so many times
you could die before you stay that way.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.594
Did your serum kill her?

19:07.040 --> 19:10.316
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.

19:13.800 --> 19:17.873
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.359
Are you out of your mind?

19:21.520 --> 19:24.318
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.075
- Then we better hurry.
- What the hell is this?

19:27.440 --> 19:30.637
Those are the keys to a very expensive
Porsche, parked outside.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.837
Figured they'd cover the cost
for one more trip to the other side.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.310
- You stole a Porsche?
- No. I borrowed it from a friend.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.550
And he wants it back.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.629
Lex.

19:41.800 --> 19:46.476
Cool thing about expensive cars,
they all come with GPS tracking.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.232
Lex, I can explain.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.355
Lex? Lex Luthor?

19:57.920 --> 20:01.310
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.277
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.351
You're not going
till the authorities get...

20:16.480 --> 20:17.754
Lana!

20:37.520 --> 20:40.876
Say goodbye, jackass. I'm gone.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.433
Mom?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.433
I used to practice this for hours
when you were young.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.397
Before Julian was born.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.792
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.116
Never could get that part right.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.839
I was injected with a hypodermic
full of some kind of chemical.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.908
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.675
This is just a delusion.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.598
Like last time?

22:00.760 --> 22:02.910
What was it then
that brought you to me?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.798
Oh, yes.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.349
You were shot after meeting
with the man you hired...

22:07.520 --> 22:11.035
...to destroy
Jonathan Kent's <i>reputation...</i>

22:11.280 --> 22:13.555
...so you could become senator.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.194
How'd that turn out, by the way?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.430
If you're my dead mother,
wouldn't you know?

22:19.640 --> 22:22.996
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.630
You ignored everything I showed you.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.995
The life you could've had,
if only you had made a different choice.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.915
And what choice is that?

22:39.080 --> 22:43.232
You think the path you've chosen
isn't going to hurt? It will.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.558
More than you can ever imagine.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.555
You're not the only one
that's going to suffer.

22:52.960 --> 22:58.751
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren
by an emptiness that can never be filled.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.315
Unless I keep you here.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.355
Stay with me, Alexander.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.870
Don't let the blood wash away
what's left of your soul.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.235
What are you talking about?
What blood?

23:23.400 --> 23:26.153
Of all the people
you're going to murder.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.074
No!

23:43.080 --> 23:44.718
My God, this stuff's got a kick.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.956
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana...

23:47.120 --> 23:48.348
...and I found your body.

23:48.520 --> 23:52.149
I figured, if the green stuff killed you,
the other one would bring you back.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.318
What? You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.875
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?

23:59.760 --> 24:00.749
Where is she, Lex?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.471
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?

24:12.640 --> 24:13.914
- Lex died.
- What?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.877
Don't worry,
I brought him back to life.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.919
He said Lana's about to take a cruise
down the river Styx if we don't find her.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.469
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?

24:22.680 --> 24:25.717
Lana and her friends have been
taking trips to the great beyond.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.718
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail
to prolong their near-death experience.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.752
But if we don't find her in <i>time...</i>

24:32.920 --> 24:35.354
...she may never come back
from her next little jaunt.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.355
So they kill themselves
and come back to life?

24:38.520 --> 24:41.592
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?

24:41.760 --> 24:43.239
Because she's hurting, clark.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.197
I mean,
she won't talk to you or to me.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.352
Maybe she seeks comfort from
the people who care about her most.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.875
The two people she knows
love her unconditionally.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.638
- Her parents.
- Yes.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.514
How are we gonna find her?

24:55.720 --> 24:58.439
Well, thanks to Homeland Security...

24:58.600 --> 25:02.388
...being on a college campus is akin
to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.630
A student ID can be tracked
anywhere, anytime.

25:04.800 --> 25:09.396
All we have to do is find out where she's
been using it and hope she's still alive.
