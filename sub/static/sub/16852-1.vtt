01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.694
Are you all right?

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.930
<i>Hey, were you recording that?</i>

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.032
No. What do you mean?
I just got caught up in the moment.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.300
<i>James!</i>

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.303
<i>Next time I call you
in the middle of the night,</i>

01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:22.971
<i>please press record!</i>

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:26.313
Okay. All right.
I promise.

01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:35.115
<i>Will you stay up
with me tonight?</i>

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.221
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:40.959
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:46.859
<i>So, I talked
to my landlord today.</i>

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.263
<i>He said no one's ever
died in my apartment, ever.</i>

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:52.033
That's not exactly something
he'd want to advertise, right?

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:54.333
<i>Yeah, but he said, like,
no kids ever lived here.</i>

01:22:54.334 --> 01:22:56.070
<i>It's always been
student housing.</i>

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.739
Uh-huh.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.742
What's that?
What are you doing?

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:03.878
<i>Oh, well, I felt that lump
move in my arm today.</i>

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:06.913
Emily, what the fuck is that?
Don't do that!

01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:08.348
<i>Thought it might be
a spider bite.</i>

01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:09.951
<i>You know,
how you hear about...?</i>

01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:12.285
That's an urban legend.
That's not real.

01:23:12.286 --> 01:23:14.755
<i>It's right under there.
Look, look, I'll show you.</i>

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.191
Stop! Stop that!
Don't do that, okay?

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:18.426
That's not good for you.
This is like your leg,

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:21.194
like seven years ago.
You still have a scar from that.

01:23:21.195 --> 01:23:24.431
Emily, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:25.801
<i>Well, I think if I just...</i>

01:23:25.802 --> 01:23:27.802
No, no, no, no, no.
Put that away.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:30.038
Seriously, Emily, look at me.

01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:33.306
Emily! Emily,
look at me, okay?

01:23:33.307 --> 01:23:35.110
You need to put that
away, all right?

01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:38.680
Digging around in your arm is
not gonna do any more good.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:40.847
You just need to put
some alcohol on that

01:23:40.848 --> 01:23:42.784
or iodine or something like that

01:23:42.785 --> 01:23:44.453
and... and... and put
a bandage on it

01:23:44.454 --> 01:23:47.320
'cause otherwise it's just
gonna get infected, okay?

01:23:47.321 --> 01:23:50.291
You know, I'll be there in a
week and I'll look at it,

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.959
but for right now,
just leave it alone.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.064
You're acting really
crazy, all right?

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:58.699
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.935
Okay.
I mean...

01:24:00.936 --> 01:24:03.937
Can you go to the bathroom
and clean that off?

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.820
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back.</i>

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:21.455
- Emily? Are you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.890
I gotta... I gotta do some
work, so what's going on?

01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:25.828
<i>I know.
This'll only take a minute.</i>

01:24:25.829 --> 01:24:28.128
- What's up?
- He's outside my room.

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.832
<i>I can hear the little
boy's footsteps.</i>

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:34.101
That's really scary, Emily,
what are you talking about?

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:38.271
Well, I just... I need to talk
to him, and I need your help.

01:24:38.272 --> 01:24:42.075
- Um... I mean, I'll help in any way that I can.
- Okay. Great, great.

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:44.379
<i>So, I'm gonna close my eyes
so he doesn't scare me.</i>

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.080
- What?
- I'm gonna close my eyes so I don't freak out...

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.982
<i>And run back in here, okay?</i>

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:51.118
<i>So you're just gonna
tell me if he's there</i>

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.086
<i>and if he's paying attention to
me, and then I'll talk to him.</i>

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.921
<i>I'll find out what he wants...</i>

01:24:54.922 --> 01:24:57.290
<i>If he wants me to find his body, or...
whatever.</i>

01:24:57.291 --> 01:24:59.760
<i>I just. Uh...
I don't want to look at him.</i>

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.163
<i>He's a ghost.
He freaks me out.</i>

01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:06.166
What?! Um...
Okay. All right.

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.401
<i>Okay, can you do that?</i>

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:08.802
Yeah.
Okay, okay.

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:11.538
<i>So, as soon as... as soon
as I open the bedroom door,</i>

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:15.476
<i>I'm gonna close my eyes, and then
you'll tell me what's there, okay?</i>

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.011
All right.

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:19.212
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:19.213 --> 01:25:21.021
<i>All right,
I'm closing my eyes.</i>

01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:28.422
Hey.
Hey.

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:30.557
<i>What's there?</i>

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.426
Uh... I-I don't
see anything.

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:35.061
It's just your hallway.

01:25:35.062 --> 01:25:36.299
<i>'Kay.</i>

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:44.307
- Anything in here?
- Um... no. No, it's...

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.911
Go in your living room.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:52.147
<i>Okay, I'm not looking.</i>

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:55.049
Listen, I don't see
anything, okay?

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:57.985
Yeah, you should go
back to your room.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.152
<i>See him?</i>

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:00.556
No, I don't see anything.

01:26:00.557 --> 01:26:03.829
Maybe... he's
done for the night.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.829
<i>I'm almost disappointed.</i>

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:11.332
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.200
- Emily!
- What?

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.836
Close your eyes.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.106
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

01:26:19.106 --> 01:26:21.208
<i>Is he here?</i>

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.543
Back to your left.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.945

01:28:38.612 --> 01:28:41.349
No. Um...
I haven't spoken to my advisor yet,

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.583
but, uh, I'll explain it to him.

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.986

Yeah, she came
very highly recommended

01:28:56.232 --> 01:29:00.101

as schizoaffective.</i>

01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:10.511
<i>It's a mild form
of schizophrenia</i>

I'd seen ghosts,</i>

on some medications...</i>

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.740
