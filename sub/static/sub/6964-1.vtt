00:53.799 --> 00:56.635
I've made
a lot of mistakes in my life...

00:58.666 --> 01:01.235
choices I can never change.

01:03.833 --> 01:07.002
We grew up having
to be soldiers around here.

01:09.532 --> 01:12.201
Most don't make it
past the age of 24.

01:20.032 --> 01:22.434
But I never thought
it would come to this.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.702
So, Bobby,
you gonna call Gina?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.734
I don't know, bro.
She seem to be tripping.

01:41.799 --> 01:44.067
Yeah, I heard she had fleas and shit.

01:45.432 --> 01:48.034
No wonder my balls have been itching.

01:48.099 --> 01:50.734
- And that's not the worst.
- You want to talk about the worst?

01:50.799 --> 01:52.901
The best part of you
ran down your mother's leg.

01:52.966 --> 01:55.902
- Oh.
- Nah, bro, she ain't got no fleas.

01:55.966 --> 01:57.600
¿Más Cafecito?

01:57.666 --> 02:00.001
It's from your dirty-ass house.

02:00.065 --> 02:01.599
But seriously though, dawg,

02:01.666 --> 02:03.601
does your mom like having
a dirty-ass house?

02:26.399 --> 02:29.802
Hold up,
we're the only ones here, right?

02:35.733 --> 02:38.001
Shut up, bitch.
You ain't gonna do shit.

02:46.532 --> 02:48.834
Don't fuck around, Jason.

02:51.199 --> 02:52.900
What are you thinking, bro?

02:54.466 --> 02:57.602
Well, I was thinking that, uh,

02:57.666 --> 03:00.602
Bobby and Derek go watch
the door and take a lookout

03:00.666 --> 03:02.434
while me and Julian
go get the cash.

03:02.499 --> 03:05.368
Whoa, fuck that, dude. We come here
all the time. They know who we are.

03:05.432 --> 03:07.567
- You're such a pussy, bro.
- Yo, be cool, man.

03:10.532 --> 03:11.599
I'll do it.

03:11.666 --> 03:14.301
All right,
me and Derek will do it.

03:14.366 --> 03:16.134
You two just go watch the door.

03:16.199 --> 03:18.234
Little bitches.

03:21.866 --> 03:24.535
That is so fucking stupid.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.200
Hey, yo, hurry the fuck up!

03:27.265 --> 03:30.234
- We're so fucking busted.
- Hey, man!

03:30.299 --> 03:33.435
Shut the fuck up, stop being
a little bitch and watch the door!

03:33.499 --> 03:34.800
Hurry up.

03:34.866 --> 03:38.102
Shit. Get the money.

03:41.332 --> 03:42.366
What are you do...

03:45.299 --> 03:47.067
- Shit.
- What the fuck, Jason?

03:47.132 --> 03:48.633
Get the money.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.367
Let's go. Come on, go.

03:50.432 --> 03:52.100
That is so fucking stupid!

03:52.165 --> 03:54.233
You know what?
You said it yourself, bitch--

03:54.299 --> 03:56.467
they know us,
and I ain't about to go to jail.

03:56.532 --> 03:59.401
Well, you should have sat there
and ate your fucking torta, asshole.

03:59.466 --> 04:02.202
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Come on.

04:39.032 --> 04:41.267
After that night,

04:41.332 --> 04:43.367
things were never the same.

04:50.733 --> 04:52.267
It seemed as though Julian and I

04:52.332 --> 04:54.901
were the only ones who grew up.

04:54.966 --> 04:56.901
Jason and Derek just got worse.

04:56.966 --> 04:58.634
- Whoo!
- Bobby!

04:58.699 --> 05:00.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

05:00.299 --> 05:02.234
Or at least Jason did.

05:02.299 --> 05:05.502
Derek was just a little tagalong.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.001
He did whatever Jason told him.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.833
Hey, say hi to your mom for me.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.900
These high school graduates.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.500
So how does it feel, mijo?

05:20.566 --> 05:22.401
I don't know.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.

05:22.466 --> 05:24.134
What, that you'll be attending

05:24.199 --> 05:25.934
West Virginia University
in the fall, or what?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.235
No, that you're gonna blow
your entire life savings

05:28.299 --> 05:29.967
on sending us both to college.

05:30.032 --> 05:32.601
Each class gotta be about what,
like, 100 satellite dishes?

05:32.666 --> 05:36.102
Órale, I don't want you guys
to think about that, okay?

05:36.165 --> 05:38.700
That's mine.
That's what I have to worry about.

05:38.766 --> 05:40.033
¿'ta bueno?

05:40.099 --> 05:42.167
I know this is
a special day for you guys,

05:42.232 --> 05:45.001
but I need you
to remember one thing:

05:45.065 --> 05:47.901
One day does not define a man.

05:47.966 --> 05:50.568
¿Entiendes?

05:50.632 --> 05:52.200
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Pop.

05:52.265 --> 05:55.701
Bobby, let me get a picture
of you guys real quick.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.234
Yeah.

05:58.499 --> 05:59.600
Orale.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.300
Smile. Perfect.

06:01.366 --> 06:03.201
My high school graduates.

06:03.265 --> 06:05.000
Hey, I'm gonna go
talk to these guys.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.734
- Okay.
- Good seeing you.

06:07.799 --> 06:09.867
Mucho cuidado.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.068
Derek, we got us
some college boys in our crew now.

06:15.132 --> 06:16.766
Julian, you know
you're my hero now, right?

06:16.833 --> 06:18.568
Oh-ho-ho, well
let me save you, Derek.

06:18.632 --> 06:20.700
What, you're all badass
now or what?

06:20.766 --> 06:22.801
Give me a fucking hug, asshole.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.902
Hey, man, watch your mouth
in front of my pops, all right?

06:25.966 --> 06:29.569
I'm sorry, señor.
I'm just really proud of su hijo.

06:29.632 --> 06:32.835
- Tell 'em about the party, fool.
- Go ahead, tell 'em.

06:32.899 --> 06:35.034
We're throwing you vatos
a party at this fool's pad.

06:35.099 --> 06:37.434
- Oh, shit.
- So when can we expect you?

06:37.499 --> 06:40.501
Y'all better come, eh?
We got cakes, trash can punch y todo.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.067
Well, hell, I'm in.
I'll be there.

06:42.132 --> 06:43.867
- Yeah? You in?
- Yeah.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.468
All right.
How about you, Julian? You in?

06:46.532 --> 06:48.834
Or are you a little pussy
like you always are?

06:52.532 --> 06:54.000
At least I got a house, fool.

06:54.065 --> 06:56.133
This one gets a piece of paper
and grows some balls.

06:56.199 --> 06:57.900
Let me show it to you,
motherfucker.

06:57.966 --> 07:00.101
Hey, put that shit away,
for real, for real.

07:00.165 --> 07:03.434
We're proud of you guys,
real fucking proud.

07:03.499 --> 07:06.368
Bring some bitches
to the party tonight, all right?

07:08.299 --> 07:09.833
And not just him.

07:09.899 --> 07:12.001
Tell your moms I'll pick her up
at 8:00, yeah? Cool?

07:13.699 --> 07:14.966
That's not funny, dawg.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.468
Ahí voy.

07:25.866 --> 07:26.833
Hi.

07:31.232 --> 07:32.433
I'm so proud of you.

07:32.499 --> 07:34.133
Thanks, Mrs. Fernandez.
It wasn't easy.

07:41.632 --> 07:42.833
I don't know.
She's your daughter.

07:47.199 --> 07:48.567
I'm gonna miss you, Mrs. Fernandez.

07:53.899 --> 07:54.866
Where's Gina?

07:58.132 --> 08:00.801
¡Ay, Chingada!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.801
Hey.

08:04.866 --> 08:06.267
Hi.

08:07.366 --> 08:10.402
Oh, Bobby.

08:10.466 --> 08:12.901
Baby.

08:12.966 --> 08:14.767
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it

08:14.833 --> 08:16.701
to your graduation.

08:16.766 --> 08:18.267
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

08:23.299 --> 08:25.167
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

08:27.232 --> 08:29.701
There's nothing left to say

08:29.766 --> 08:33.568
I wanna take it for what it's for

08:33.631 --> 08:35.332
And, baby, bring it...

08:35.399 --> 08:37.200
I love you so much.

08:38.399 --> 08:42.169
I'ma have your life...

08:52.399 --> 08:54.334
So are you gonna be okay?

08:54.399 --> 08:56.601
Yeah.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.068
I don't need no man.

09:01.899 --> 09:03.433
Look at you.

09:03.499 --> 09:07.236
You think you're all bad now.

09:07.299 --> 09:10.135
I can see it in your eyes.

09:10.199 --> 09:12.301
Nah.

09:22.532 --> 09:25.268
How long are
you gonna be gone for?

09:27.899 --> 09:30.201
Four, maybe five years.

09:34.265 --> 09:37.234
But you can come visit me
any time you want.

09:38.866 --> 09:40.934
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.769
I can't afford that.

09:47.432 --> 09:50.234
Well, I could send you some money.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.868
Or better yet,
I could send you some plane tickets.

09:54.366 --> 09:56.468
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.667
Gina.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.401
Gina, look at me.

10:06.466 --> 10:09.001
- What?
- Hey.

10:09.065 --> 10:12.935
Hey, look at me.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.268
It's okay.

10:21.132 --> 10:23.167
Would you promise me one thing?

10:26.632 --> 10:28.333
Yeah.

10:29.432 --> 10:30.399
What?

10:31.566 --> 10:33.067
You'll wait for me?

10:38.366 --> 10:39.767
Yeah.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.766
I'll wait for you.

10:43.966 --> 10:46.435
The gloves is off,
the sword is sharp

10:46.499 --> 10:49.168
I swear to God, this time
I am leaving a mark

10:49.232 --> 10:52.034
And I dare a motherfucker
to say something about Bugsy

10:52.099 --> 10:54.201
They find ya bitch-ass in Kentucky

10:54.265 --> 10:56.100
Nothing will get in my way

10:56.165 --> 10:59.001
I'm willing to pay
however much it cost...

10:59.065 --> 11:00.866
Bobby, you made it.

11:02.399 --> 11:04.501
I thought I told you to bring
some fucking bitches, man, come on.

11:04.566 --> 11:06.534
This is the only chick I travel with.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.568
Aww, don't do that shit
in front of me, come on.

11:09.632 --> 11:11.800
- Besides, don't you have Derek?
- Aww, fuck you.

11:11.866 --> 11:13.500
What's up, bitches?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.935
Is that the only chick you brought?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.935
- Duh.
- It's the only chick I need.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.269
- You whooped-ass motherfucker.
- You're fucked up,

11:23.332 --> 11:26.635
Get your-- come on,
get out of here, fool. Stupid ass.

11:26.699 --> 11:28.367
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

11:28.432 --> 11:29.966
Have a drink,
smoke some weed,

11:30.032 --> 11:31.967
do whatever you want
with your girl.

11:32.032 --> 11:33.967
I'm gonna get that girl over there.

11:34.032 --> 11:36.467
She's been eye-fucking me
all night, man. Fuck.

11:36.532 --> 11:38.967
- Have fun, all right?
- All right, thank you, man. Thank you.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.935
You will refer to me as King,
and I run SA...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.035
How are y'all doing?
I'm Julian.

11:45.099 --> 11:48.302
Can I get you ladies a beer? Yeah?

11:48.366 --> 11:51.001
Hey, move, pussy.

11:52.432 --> 11:54.467
Really, dude? What the fuck
is your problem, bro?

11:55.899 --> 11:58.534
What the fuck?
You ain't gonna do shit.

11:58.599 --> 12:00.701
I ain't gonna do shit?

12:00.766 --> 12:03.368
What, you gonna do something?
Do something, bitch.

12:03.432 --> 12:06.301
Go. Go.
Do something.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.434
Punk-ass bitch,
that's what I thought.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.267
- What the fuck, bitch?
- Oh, what?

12:15.332 --> 12:16.900
- Hey, hey!
- Who's the pussy now? Do it.

12:16.966 --> 12:19.368
Come on, do it.
Do your boy, bro.

12:19.432 --> 12:22.134
- Come on, put one in my fucking dome.
- What the fuck?

12:22.199 --> 12:24.968
- What the hell?
- I'm tired of this fucking pendejo

12:25.032 --> 12:27.467
always running in my shit.

12:27.532 --> 12:29.133
- What the fuck?
- What?

12:30.165 --> 12:31.466
What?

12:33.532 --> 12:35.033
He grabbed my dick, bro.

12:35.099 --> 12:36.733
I wouldn't touch your pito chiquito

12:36.799 --> 12:38.500
with a fucking ten-foot pole, bro.

12:38.566 --> 12:40.768
He fucking grabbed your dick?
That's why you pull out the fucking gun?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.501
Come on, man,
you're fucking up the party.

12:42.566 --> 12:45.402
I gotta keep this motherfucker
in check every once in a while, bro.

12:45.466 --> 12:46.900
Hey, put the gun away, man.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.168
Man, I overreacted.
I overreacted.

12:49.232 --> 12:51.467
Hey, go back to partying, man.
What the fuck?

12:51.532 --> 12:52.966
Shut the fuck up, man.

12:53.032 --> 12:56.168
Hey, hey, nothing can come
between us, right?

12:56.232 --> 12:58.601
Especially with all the shit
we've fucking been through.

13:03.466 --> 13:05.401
Come on, stupid.

13:05.466 --> 13:06.934
My bad.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.801
Get a fucking drink.

13:08.866 --> 13:11.201
"Overreacted" is a big
fucking word for you, Mexican.

13:11.265 --> 13:13.000
Pulling out a fucking gun.

13:13.065 --> 13:15.467
Come on, bro, let's get
some fucking pizza, some pizza.

13:15.532 --> 13:18.234
Oh, pito chiquito.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.767
Do you want a beer?

13:20.866 --> 13:22.133
Yes.

13:23.699 --> 13:25.133
It's foamy.

13:25.199 --> 13:27.167
Very foamy.
That's yours.

13:34.966 --> 13:37.568
- Love you, Pop.
- I love you, too.

13:37.632 --> 13:39.533
- Phone home, cabrón.
- I will.

13:39.599 --> 13:41.734
Mucho cuidado.

13:43.799 --> 13:46.601
Julian.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.601
I want to tell you, mijo,

13:48.666 --> 13:50.601
that I'm very, very proud of you.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.035
And I'm pretty sure

13:53.099 --> 13:54.800
your parents would be
proud of you too, mijo.

13:54.866 --> 13:56.801
No, no, en serio.

13:56.866 --> 13:59.101
And no matter what anybody says...

14:00.632 --> 14:02.700
you're my son.

14:02.766 --> 14:04.734
¿'ta bueno?

14:15.866 --> 14:17.467
Stop it.
Stop it.

14:17.532 --> 14:19.600
Stop it with that
teary-eyed shit, eh?

14:19.666 --> 14:21.501
You're supposed to be
happy right now.

14:28.032 --> 14:29.500
Cuídate, okay?

14:40.432 --> 14:43.168
My father took Julian in
when he was 10.

14:45.232 --> 14:48.034
His parents were in and out
of rehab for most of his life.

14:51.399 --> 14:54.568
Sometimes the place you're from
and the people you love

14:54.632 --> 14:57.034
are the only things
holding you down.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.569
We can never erase what happened,

15:02.632 --> 15:04.567
but when you get the opportunity

15:04.632 --> 15:07.735
to do something right,

15:07.799 --> 15:09.467
you take it.

15:14.599 --> 15:17.401
Robert Ramirez, Julian Medina,

15:17.466 --> 15:19.868
pack up your stuff
and come with me.

15:21.766 --> 15:23.701
Bobby, what do you think
this is about, man?

15:23.766 --> 15:26.935
I don't know, man.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.102
I mean,
we didn't do anything, right?

15:29.165 --> 15:31.233
Relax. Here they come.

15:31.299 --> 15:33.300
Gentlemen, Agent Montelongo.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.035
Afternoon. Have a seat.

15:36.099 --> 15:39.135
We don't have a lot of time,
so were gonna get right into this.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.833
You know this guy?

15:40.899 --> 15:43.334
What about this guy?

15:43.399 --> 15:47.102
That's Jason.
We all grew up together.

15:47.165 --> 15:50.801
How do they feel about you two
graduating from the academy?

15:50.866 --> 15:52.133
How would they know?

15:52.199 --> 15:56.336
Childhood friends and all,
you'd think--

15:56.399 --> 15:59.902
No, this is something
Julian and I decided to do.

15:59.966 --> 16:02.201
We kept it from everyone
but our father.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.033
I mean, not because we're ashamed

16:04.099 --> 16:06.000
but just 'cause we didn't think
they would understand.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.867
Good.
That's all I needed to know.

16:08.933 --> 16:12.803
Jason and Derek are connected
to a man that goes by Nadie.

16:12.866 --> 16:15.568
He's on our Most Wanted list
and I want his ass.

16:15.632 --> 16:18.401
You two are being assigned
to get Nadie,

16:18.466 --> 16:21.669
immediately following
tomorrow's graduation ceremony.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.167
Congratulations.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.968
Robert, you're gonna do
some time in jail--

16:26.032 --> 16:28.234
just a little actual time.

16:28.299 --> 16:30.334
The rest will be added
to the system.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.434
A couple of B&Es,
minor offenses--

16:32.499 --> 16:35.101
nothing crazy.
You'll get all the details.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.100
Julian,

16:37.165 --> 16:39.333
you're the smartest kid
at the academy.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.368
We want your help running
this thing from a distance.

16:42.432 --> 16:45.001
No one knows
these two better than you two.

16:45.065 --> 16:47.600
We're very lucky
to have you on our team.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.869
I've set up a meeting
with the captain of the SAPD.

16:50.933 --> 16:52.868
We'll brief you more then.

16:52.933 --> 16:55.335
Good luck, gentlemen.

16:55.399 --> 16:58.301
This is the shit
you came to the academy for.

17:20.933 --> 17:24.236
I found out Pops was sick
when we graduated.

17:26.665 --> 17:29.568
The only contact we'd had
with him was over the phone.

17:31.499 --> 17:33.601
He never said anything.

17:35.399 --> 17:37.334
And he didn't start to sound bad

17:37.399 --> 17:40.268
until the cancer finally
took total control of his lungs.

17:44.499 --> 17:46.801
It was hard to see him like that.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.935
But my father would
rather have died

17:51.000 --> 17:52.534
than missed seeing his
little homeboys

17:52.599 --> 17:55.234
graduate from the
FBI Academy.

18:06.566 --> 18:09.735
It was a sad day when
my father died.

18:11.099 --> 18:13.868
He was all I had for most
of my life.

18:17.432 --> 18:19.433
You be strong, mijo.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.868
Don't ever let me

18:22.933 --> 18:25.802
or your father down, okay?

18:27.599 --> 18:29.600
You do as he says.

18:31.432 --> 18:33.367
He loves you

18:33.432 --> 18:36.201
more than anything in this world.

18:38.165 --> 18:40.133
Acércate.

18:50.399 --> 18:52.701
And after my mother died,

18:52.766 --> 18:55.101
Pops made me strong

18:55.165 --> 18:58.101
and helped me to understand
that there's a plan for all of us.

19:16.065 --> 19:19.501
My father's death
was especially hard on Julian.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.368
He was the only true father
he ever knew.

19:43.566 --> 19:46.702
Julian was only 13
when they overdosed.

19:50.766 --> 19:53.001
He refused to go to their funeral.

20:12.232 --> 20:15.301
After we buried my father,

20:15.366 --> 20:18.702
Julian was the only family
I had left.

20:43.799 --> 20:47.102
Agent Ramirez, Medina,
pleasure to meet you.

20:47.165 --> 20:49.800
- I heard nothing but good things.
- Cap.

20:49.866 --> 20:53.269
You guys ready to work?

20:53.332 --> 20:55.500
Good, 'cause I'm gonna need you

20:55.566 --> 20:57.701
to get closer to Jason
than we originally anticipated.

20:57.766 --> 20:59.367
This thing's a little bigger
than we actually thought.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.666
How much bigger?

21:00.733 --> 21:02.434
Nadie pretty much owns Texas.

21:02.499 --> 21:04.500
He's got connections
in and out of the US.

21:04.566 --> 21:06.801
This guy's set up shop
in just about every major city.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.069
He's got a legion of followers
as young as goddamn 10-years-old.

21:10.132 --> 21:12.567
If the Bureau knows so much,
why can't you bring him down?

21:12.632 --> 21:15.501
As it stands right now,
we can't directly link him to anything.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.335
Legally speaking,
this guy's untouchable.

21:18.399 --> 21:21.468
- Why is SAPD involved?
- We have reason to believe

21:21.532 --> 21:23.867
that one of our finest
might be on the payroll.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.601
And not a lot of badges
know about this at all

21:25.666 --> 21:27.300
'cause there's not
many people we can trust.

21:27.366 --> 21:30.769
Seems like Nadie only trusts Jason
and Derek and people that he brings in.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.801
That's where you come in.
You understand?

21:32.866 --> 21:35.168
I don't see how anyone
could trust those two.

21:35.232 --> 21:38.234
Well, they may be the only two
that know Nadie's true identity.

21:38.299 --> 21:40.234
To everybody else,
it's just a name.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.834
Cool.
Let's do it.

21:42.899 --> 21:45.234
You understand?

21:45.299 --> 21:47.401
All right, gentlemen,
get out of here.

21:47.466 --> 21:49.434
I'll set it up.

21:55.866 --> 21:58.301
Is this what four years of college

21:58.366 --> 22:01.035
and six months in the academy
gets you these days?

22:01.099 --> 22:03.234
We wouldn't have to put
rookies on the case

22:03.299 --> 22:05.668
if you were in control
of your own backyard.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.400
In the last two years

22:15.466 --> 22:17.835
San Antonio has become victim

22:17.899 --> 22:19.867
to organized crime

22:19.933 --> 22:22.902
and drug trafficking
at an intolerable level.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.234
Our children are becoming

22:25.299 --> 22:27.734
drug addicts and criminals

22:27.799 --> 22:30.101
right before our very eyes.

22:30.165 --> 22:33.401
This must come to an end.

22:33.466 --> 22:35.935
If you know of any illegal activity

22:36.000 --> 22:39.303
or of anyone involved
in this epidemic,

22:39.366 --> 22:42.135
please contact
your local authorities immediately.

22:42.199 --> 22:45.001
Hey, you gotta pay your tab.

22:45.065 --> 22:46.833
Well, how much do I owe you?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.533
$15, plus tip.

22:48.599 --> 22:50.634
15 bucks for three beers
in this shithole?

22:50.699 --> 22:53.501
Here's a tip:
Why don't you clean this bitch up?

22:53.566 --> 22:55.801
Just pay the tab, pinche guey.

22:58.265 --> 23:00.834
Empty out the fucking register,
now!

23:00.899 --> 23:02.867
Nobody fucking move.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.233
What?

23:16.733 --> 23:18.668
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!

23:18.733 --> 23:20.101
Drop the gun now!

23:21.199 --> 23:23.868
Hey, relax.

23:25.232 --> 23:27.033
You're under arrest.

23:27.099 --> 23:28.366
I figured.

23:30.933 --> 23:32.467
Watch your head.

23:32.532 --> 23:34.867
- We have one in custody.
- 10-4.

23:36.933 --> 23:39.835
Fuck you, asshole.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.435
I'm too sexy for my shirt...

23:59.599 --> 24:01.701
Yeah, what's up?

24:01.766 --> 24:03.801
Yeah, I just got here.

24:03.866 --> 24:06.034
All right, all right.

24:21.232 --> 24:23.200
You're free to go.

24:23.265 --> 24:25.100
Apparently someone thinks
you're worth a damn.

24:41.099 --> 24:42.066
Derek?

24:43.165 --> 24:44.733
Surprise, surprise.

24:44.799 --> 24:46.867
Damn.

24:46.933 --> 24:49.135
- Hey, man.
- Look at you.

24:49.199 --> 24:51.200
Look at you.
Moving up in the world, huh?

24:51.265 --> 24:52.866
Just a little bit.

24:52.933 --> 24:55.702
- Badass.
- Just doing my thing.

24:55.766 --> 24:57.567
Did you bail me out?

24:57.632 --> 24:59.800
Hell yeah, I bailed you out.
How do you think you got out of there?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.334
Thank you.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.701
I don't know how to repay you.
I can't repay you.

25:03.766 --> 25:05.801
Don't worry about it. I got you.

25:05.866 --> 25:07.701
Is that yours?

25:07.766 --> 25:10.001
Hell yeah. Come on, let me
show you what else has changed.

25:10.065 --> 25:12.801
Where the hell you been at, man?

25:12.866 --> 25:14.133
In there.

25:14.199 --> 25:16.534
I used to be on the block all day

25:16.599 --> 25:19.568
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

25:19.632 --> 25:22.034
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

25:22.099 --> 25:24.534
They still want to lock me up, oh

25:24.799 --> 25:26.600
They want to give me life...

25:26.666 --> 25:28.467
Listen, grab yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.

25:28.532 --> 25:30.767
- All right.
- What are you having?

25:30.833 --> 25:34.570
Oh... vodka on the rocks.

25:34.632 --> 25:36.667
So how long has this place been open?

25:36.733 --> 25:38.701
About two years.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.867
What do I owe you?

25:41.933 --> 25:43.467
Oh, nothing.
It's on the house, man.

25:43.532 --> 25:46.001
Oh, rock 'n' roll, man. Thanks.

25:47.232 --> 25:49.067
Bobby Ramirez.

25:49.132 --> 25:51.200
Bobby Ramirez.

25:51.265 --> 25:53.467
- Come on, man, get over here.
- God.

25:53.532 --> 25:55.800
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you. How have you been?

25:55.866 --> 25:58.001
Damn, look at you.

25:58.065 --> 26:00.333
What's up with you?
That's the question.

26:00.399 --> 26:03.635
Well, you know, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

26:03.699 --> 26:05.100
I need some of that.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.434
It's good to see
you and Derek doing so well.

26:09.499 --> 26:10.733
Yeah, you know.

26:10.799 --> 26:12.800
What kind of trouble
are you getting yourself into?

26:12.866 --> 26:14.200
Eh, you know.

26:14.265 --> 26:15.899
Little college boy,

26:15.966 --> 26:18.001
you were all straight and narrow
and shit, come on.

26:18.065 --> 26:19.499
People change.

26:19.566 --> 26:21.834
What do you mean?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.335
I fucked up, jacked a bar.

26:28.065 --> 26:29.866
Yeah, don't worry,
I won't be robbing this place.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.101
God damn,
that's what I'm talking about.

26:32.165 --> 26:34.333
- Shit.
- Fucking money's tight, you know.

26:34.399 --> 26:36.134
That bad, huh?

26:36.199 --> 26:39.068
Eh, shit just kind of went downhill
after Pops passed.

26:39.132 --> 26:42.502
Yeah, I heard about it.
I'm sorry, Bobby.

26:42.566 --> 26:45.835
No, don't be.
It's just life.

26:45.899 --> 26:47.734
Anyway, how's Julian doing, man?

26:47.799 --> 26:50.268
Oh, he's killing it, man, working for
some big company up in New York.

26:50.332 --> 26:52.333
No shit.
Who'd have ever guessed--

26:52.399 --> 26:54.334
that little bitch
always scared and shit?

26:54.399 --> 26:56.834
He'll surprise you.

26:56.899 --> 26:59.268
Hey, let's--
let's grab two shots.

26:59.332 --> 27:02.068
Don't worry about paying me back
for bailing you out.

27:02.132 --> 27:04.467
Joe, let's get two shots
for this guy,

27:04.532 --> 27:06.267
celebrate my boy's return.

27:06.332 --> 27:07.566
Joe.

27:09.566 --> 27:11.534
Don't you got something to do?

27:15.532 --> 27:16.733
Yeah.

27:16.799 --> 27:18.400
Never write it down...

27:18.466 --> 27:20.401
- Salud.
- Cheers.

27:20.466 --> 27:22.401
If you riding it right

27:22.466 --> 27:24.167
If you riding with us,
you riding for life.

27:24.232 --> 27:26.500
Shit, whatever happened to Melissa?

27:26.566 --> 27:29.201
Oh, dude.

27:29.265 --> 27:32.234
She left my sheets
all bloody, man, oh.

27:32.299 --> 27:34.768
You know,
I videotaped that shit too.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.467
I videotaped that motherfucker.

27:36.532 --> 27:38.133
Come on, come on.

27:39.299 --> 27:41.200
God damn, you've done well.

27:41.265 --> 27:43.900
- Well, you'd be amazed.
- By what?

27:43.966 --> 27:46.735
- What?
- You said I'd be amazed.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.267
Yeah, well, you'd be amazed

27:48.332 --> 27:50.834
at what kind of money you can get

27:50.899 --> 27:52.934
by not doing shit.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.968
What do you mean?

28:00.466 --> 28:01.867
You hear of Nadie?

28:04.532 --> 28:05.966
Nadie?

28:06.032 --> 28:08.534
- Yeah, Nadie.
- What, is it "no one"?

28:08.599 --> 28:12.836
Yeah, Nadie--
he's a real person.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.834
No.

28:18.599 --> 28:21.969
Well, he's the world's
leading importer-exporter.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.568
In what?

28:26.632 --> 28:28.867
Do you work for him?

28:28.933 --> 28:30.467
He bought you that shirt?

28:30.532 --> 28:32.467
Yeah, he bought me
this fucking shirt, yeah.

28:32.532 --> 28:34.467
- Bought you this house?
- He bought me this fucking house

28:34.532 --> 28:36.300
and these shoes
and this fucking watch.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.801
No, I am him.

28:38.866 --> 28:42.035
What, you're Nadie?

28:42.099 --> 28:44.067
Yeah.

28:50.232 --> 28:52.434
So what do you import?

28:54.099 --> 28:56.367
Anything and everything.

28:56.432 --> 28:58.367
You see, the thing is,

28:58.432 --> 29:00.567
I never get my hands dirty.

29:02.899 --> 29:04.900
How?

29:08.432 --> 29:10.367
I broker the shit.

29:10.432 --> 29:12.934
I'm the organizer, the maker,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.168
the pusher and the seller.

29:15.232 --> 29:17.767
But I never touch anything.

29:19.866 --> 29:22.802
- Why are you telling me this?
- You asked.

29:22.866 --> 29:25.268
Yeah, I know I fucking asked,
but this is some heavy-ass shit.

29:25.332 --> 29:27.901
You fucking asked.
You fucking asked.

29:31.299 --> 29:33.000
Man, Bobby.

29:34.199 --> 29:35.533
You should come work for me, man,

29:36.866 --> 29:39.134
put a little--
a little extra change in your pocket.

29:39.199 --> 29:42.969
No. I don't know, bro.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.601
What?
You don't know?

29:45.666 --> 29:47.200
You don't know?

29:49.265 --> 29:51.767
- I don't know.
- You know what?

29:51.833 --> 29:54.902
You're the same fucking pussy
you were in high school.

29:54.966 --> 29:58.369
You are the same
fucking pussy you were in high school.

29:58.432 --> 30:00.367
Nothing fucking changes.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.967
The same fucking pussy,
like this, look.

30:03.032 --> 30:05.567
Come on, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

30:05.632 --> 30:07.266
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

30:07.332 --> 30:09.200
I just got popped two seconds ago.

30:10.599 --> 30:11.566
And?

30:14.699 --> 30:17.501
Anyway, how do you know
you can trust me?

30:19.399 --> 30:20.967
Shit, man.

30:22.065 --> 30:23.766
After all we've been through...

30:26.432 --> 30:28.033
all we've been through, man...

30:29.132 --> 30:30.500
why wouldn't I?

30:35.032 --> 30:36.967
Shit. Fuck.

30:37.032 --> 30:38.700
It's nice seeing you,
motherfucker.

30:38.766 --> 30:40.868
It's nice seeing you.

30:40.933 --> 30:43.235
Good to see you too, man.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.668
Aww, man, fucking Bobby.

30:45.733 --> 30:48.268
Come on, get one.

30:48.332 --> 30:50.667
Get one, huh?

30:50.733 --> 30:53.068
Get one. That's some
high-quality shit right there.

30:54.699 --> 30:56.934
- Courtesy of Nadie.
- You.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.469
- Courtesy of Nadie.
- I think I like Nadie.

31:01.632 --> 31:03.734
My turn.

31:03.799 --> 31:05.767
My turn, motherfucker.

31:43.599 --> 31:45.033
You dumb motherfucker!

31:45.099 --> 31:46.667
Oh, motherfucker.

31:46.733 --> 31:48.468
You know whose money
you're fucking with?

31:48.532 --> 31:50.567
Oh, fuck.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.534
Jason just funds everything

33:31.599 --> 33:33.200
and we do all the actual work.

33:33.265 --> 33:36.635
He just kicks back
and watches his bankroll get fatter.

33:36.699 --> 33:39.501
Have you seen that guy's house?

33:39.566 --> 33:42.335
Can he be traced though?

33:42.399 --> 33:46.136
Only if we can connect
Jason to the buyers.

33:46.199 --> 33:48.401
See, each buyer sets up
a dummy company,

33:48.466 --> 33:50.534
and that company
pays Jason.

33:50.599 --> 33:54.302
And he's smart.
And he's not greedy.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.334
He doesn't nickel-and-dime shit.

33:56.399 --> 33:59.068
Oh, shit, there he is.

33:59.132 --> 34:01.534
Did you know he was gonna be here?

34:01.599 --> 34:03.267
Come on, Bobby,

34:03.332 --> 34:06.101
do you really think
this is a coincidence?

34:06.165 --> 34:08.833
Bobby.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.199
Mira ese pinche guey.

34:12.264 --> 34:15.301
- Holy shit, man.
- Good to see you, papá.

34:15.366 --> 34:16.967
You didn't tell me he was in town.

34:17.032 --> 34:18.800
He just got in.

34:18.866 --> 34:20.434
May I?

34:20.498 --> 34:22.934
- Yeah, have a seat.
- Good seeing you, man.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.202
Bobby, is everything good?

34:27.264 --> 34:29.132
- What happened?
- No, it's just this thing.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.534
Yeah, I put a couple guys on it.
It's cool.

34:31.599 --> 34:33.333
All right.

34:33.399 --> 34:35.434
What brings you to town?

34:35.498 --> 34:37.934
The job, man-- I got laid off,

34:38.000 --> 34:39.568
had to come back home.

34:39.632 --> 34:41.367
Sorry to hear that, man.

34:41.431 --> 34:42.866
Shit happens, you know.

34:42.933 --> 34:43.967
It's all right.

34:47.431 --> 34:50.034
Hello. What?

34:50.099 --> 34:52.100
Yeah, I'll be right there.

34:53.933 --> 34:55.333
Sorry, guys, I gotta run.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.870
Hey, but don't worry about
losing your job too much.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.602
I... may have some work for you.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.834
Gracias, man.

35:05.899 --> 35:07.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah, appreciate it.

35:07.466 --> 35:08.967
- You game?
- Yeah, you know me. I'm down.

35:09.032 --> 35:10.767
All right.
See you later.

35:10.833 --> 35:12.801
All right.

35:26.232 --> 35:28.534
What the fuck is Julian
doing back around here?

35:28.599 --> 35:30.667
I guess he just moved back.

35:30.733 --> 35:33.068
I could use the manpower right now.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.667
I don't trust that guy.

35:36.733 --> 35:38.935
Yeah, but he's cool.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.001
All right?

35:41.065 --> 35:42.032
Remember...

35:43.065 --> 35:45.033
we were all there.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.466
Let's go.

36:02.399 --> 36:04.267
What the fuck are you doing?

36:04.332 --> 36:06.033
What?

36:06.099 --> 36:08.401
I thought you weren't
supposed to get involved.

36:08.466 --> 36:12.036
Come on, Bobby, I'm tired
of being a fucking desk monkey, bro.

36:12.099 --> 36:14.034
I signed up to see some action,

36:14.099 --> 36:15.867
you know what I mean?

36:17.632 --> 36:19.867
Look, I get it.

36:19.933 --> 36:21.868
Okay?
I just didn't--

36:21.933 --> 36:23.801
I just didn't want you
on this side of things.

36:23.866 --> 36:25.534
What, Bobby?

36:25.599 --> 36:28.034
What, the drugs, the partying?

36:28.099 --> 36:31.202
Man, you forget we used
to run these streets together, bro.

36:31.265 --> 36:34.201
Give me a little credit.

36:34.265 --> 36:36.233
I got this.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.868
Then look me in the eyes
and tell me you got this.

36:46.032 --> 36:47.500
I got it.

36:49.299 --> 36:51.034
Okay?

36:53.532 --> 36:55.267
Okay.

36:59.032 --> 37:02.435
Has Jason mentioned Gina yet?

37:02.499 --> 37:04.434
Gina? No. Why?

37:04.499 --> 37:07.535
I haven't even seen her.

37:07.599 --> 37:09.600
You should ask him about it, bro.

37:16.366 --> 37:18.468
You get the tickets I sent you?

37:18.532 --> 37:20.000
Yeah, I did.

37:20.065 --> 37:22.133
Are you excited to be coming out?

37:22.199 --> 37:26.002
Mm, I don't know, Bobby.

37:26.065 --> 37:28.600
You know, I have beauty school.

37:28.666 --> 37:30.734
And you know what my instructor said?

37:30.799 --> 37:32.400
That I'm a natural.

37:33.899 --> 37:35.333
Well, yeah, but I--

37:35.399 --> 37:37.334
I spent a lot of money on those tickets.

37:37.399 --> 37:39.601
What do you want me to do, Bobby?

37:39.666 --> 37:41.601
I can't just drop everything

37:41.666 --> 37:44.235
and fly across the country
just to go see you.

37:44.299 --> 37:46.034
What are you talking about?

37:46.099 --> 37:48.267
I mean, you promised.

37:53.265 --> 37:56.534
Okay, I'm gonna come.

37:57.699 --> 37:59.967
I love you.

38:00.032 --> 38:02.134
I love you too.

38:02.199 --> 38:04.634
I'll be waiting for you, okay?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.267
Adiós.

41:48.499 --> 41:50.367
What's happening?

41:51.399 --> 41:53.167
How are you doing, brother?

41:53.232 --> 41:55.400
Good to see you, man.

41:55.466 --> 41:57.601
Hey, brother.

42:01.699 --> 42:03.467
Bobby.

42:03.532 --> 42:05.033
Thank you.

42:05.099 --> 42:08.435
To the man who keeps
our pockets fat and us out of jail.

42:09.666 --> 42:11.334
- En los ojos, ¿eh?
- To you.

42:11.399 --> 42:13.834
- Seven years of bad sex.
- Seriously.

42:13.899 --> 42:16.701
Having a good time, Bobby?

42:16.766 --> 42:18.901
Can't complain.

42:18.966 --> 42:23.236
See, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

42:26.866 --> 42:28.867
Hey, get up.

42:33.265 --> 42:35.967
That's what I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

42:38.099 --> 42:39.733
See, when you left,

42:39.799 --> 42:43.035
Gina and I-- we--

42:43.099 --> 42:45.701
you know, I hope there's
no hard feelings, right?

42:47.132 --> 42:48.967
How are you, Bobby?

42:49.032 --> 42:51.534
You know, I've been. And you?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.968
I can't complain.

43:05.699 --> 43:07.534
You should go.

43:21.199 --> 43:23.234
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

43:23.299 --> 43:26.435
A prize like that needed
someone to take care of her.

43:26.499 --> 43:28.567
A trophy always needs polishing.

43:28.632 --> 43:31.935
It's like you said,
I'm the one that left, right?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.669
It is what it is.

43:34.733 --> 43:36.234
We cool, right?

43:36.299 --> 43:38.834
Hell yeah, we're cool.

43:38.899 --> 43:40.867
I mean,
look at all you've done for me.

43:40.933 --> 43:44.436
That's right.
That's right.

43:44.499 --> 43:46.601
Derek, I need to talk
to Bobby about something.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.634
Take your girl.

43:53.099 --> 43:54.834
No, no, Julian, Julian,
you're good.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.001
You're good.
Have a seat.

43:57.065 --> 43:59.600
Come on, let's go.

44:03.399 --> 44:05.501
There's a job I need
you to do for me.

44:05.566 --> 44:07.034
What is it?

44:07.099 --> 44:09.701
It's a little vacation.

44:09.766 --> 44:11.367
I need you to go to
Mexico for me.

44:11.432 --> 44:14.368
Work hard, play harder, right?

44:14.432 --> 44:16.467
That's right. That's right.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.502
That's that.
Come over here.

44:25.099 --> 44:27.134
Hey, Brent.
How are you doing, man?

44:27.199 --> 44:28.567
Hey, Derek, what's up, bro?

44:28.632 --> 44:31.735
Dude, the señoritas
in here are prime.

44:31.799 --> 44:33.901
We try.

44:33.966 --> 44:37.002
Listen, how did that--
that lead I gave you-- how did it go?

44:37.065 --> 44:39.467
Oh, yeah, man. Hey, you really
helped us deliver on that one, man.

44:39.532 --> 44:40.799
Good.

44:40.866 --> 44:42.801
If there's anything
we can do for you,

44:42.866 --> 44:45.301
you should let us know,
all right?

44:45.366 --> 44:48.268
- Anything you need, man.
- I appreciate that.

44:48.332 --> 44:49.866
Matter of fact, you know what?

44:49.933 --> 44:51.868
I have some friends
that just came into town.

44:51.933 --> 44:53.734
I haven't seen them in a while.

44:53.799 --> 44:55.700
I want you to run them for me.

44:55.766 --> 44:58.435
All right, we can do that.

44:58.499 --> 45:00.000
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

45:00.065 --> 45:01.599
Cool.

45:01.666 --> 45:04.935
Joe, take care of them.
Have a good time.

45:22.432 --> 45:22.432
There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

45:22.466 --> 45:25.435
There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

45:25.499 --> 45:28.034
The average is 80 points a game,
and the guy's a freshman.

45:28.099 --> 45:30.034
Hey, Terry.
You know what I mean?

45:30.099 --> 45:32.234
It's all about the young talent.

45:32.299 --> 45:35.402
It's like college teams are
always better than the pro teams,

45:35.466 --> 45:37.501
that's all there is too it.
'Cause the pros don't give a shit.

45:37.566 --> 45:40.101
They're making too much.
Baseball, basketball-- you name it.

45:40.165 --> 45:42.400
Don't even get me started
On soccer.

45:42.466 --> 45:45.735
It's the most boring sport
that's ever existed.

45:45.799 --> 45:48.034
I honestly don't understand
how people can watch it.

45:48.099 --> 45:49.600
It's like you kick the ball,
you kick the ball,

45:49.666 --> 45:51.667
you kick the ball one way--
nothing happens.

45:51.733 --> 45:54.202
You kick the ball, you kick the ball
the other way-- nothing happens.

45:54.265 --> 45:56.800
So boring.
Final score-- one-nothing.

45:56.866 --> 45:58.667
That's exciting.

46:03.632 --> 46:05.934
What?

46:31.466 --> 46:33.434
- Jesus Christ.
- I told you.

46:35.899 --> 46:38.935
Jesus.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.669
- There's the man.
- Fuck, bro.

46:41.733 --> 46:45.303
Escobar called.
He wants his fucking house back.

46:45.366 --> 46:48.035
Have you ever had your nails done
by an Asian woman?

46:48.099 --> 46:52.036
- Uh, no. Have you?
- Fuck no.

46:52.099 --> 46:54.634
Well, I have this theory.

46:54.699 --> 46:57.034
See, a man with clean nails

46:57.099 --> 46:59.868
cares for himself.

46:59.933 --> 47:02.268
A man that cares for himself

47:02.332 --> 47:04.000
cares for his life.

47:04.065 --> 47:08.102
I find it tends to cleanse
my conscience,

47:08.165 --> 47:11.401
like a Catholic, you know,
saying those Hail Marys.

47:17.132 --> 47:20.668
Do you care about your life,
Julian?

47:20.733 --> 47:23.268
What the fuck are you
talking about, J?

47:27.866 --> 47:29.934
No.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.435
Why did you do that?

47:32.499 --> 47:33.700
He's our brother.

47:33.766 --> 47:35.801
No no no!

47:35.866 --> 47:38.568
He was your brother.

47:38.632 --> 47:41.768
And your brother was
a fucking pig.

47:43.632 --> 47:46.234
That's impossible,
you sick fuck.

47:49.632 --> 47:51.200
Is it, Bobby?

47:51.265 --> 47:52.966
Oh, man,
look what you did to him.

47:53.032 --> 47:54.566
- Is it?
- Look at him.

47:54.632 --> 47:56.567
Why the fuck did I have a camera

47:56.632 --> 47:58.600
following me around
for the past two weeks?

47:58.666 --> 48:00.667
I'm not stupid.

48:04.332 --> 48:06.167
That's fucking bullshit.

48:06.232 --> 48:08.601
Who told you that, huh?

48:08.666 --> 48:12.002
Tell me, motherfucker!

48:12.065 --> 48:15.168
Don't forget who I am.

48:17.599 --> 48:19.534
What kind of brother doesn't know

48:19.599 --> 48:22.268
his own blood is a fucking cop?

48:22.332 --> 48:23.766
I should pop you too.

48:23.833 --> 48:25.768
Yeah? What are you accusing me of?

48:25.833 --> 48:28.602
Huh? Huh?

48:28.666 --> 48:30.467
Say it, motherfucker!

48:30.532 --> 48:32.300
Say it!

48:32.366 --> 48:35.235
After all we've been through.

48:36.933 --> 48:38.868
I live my whole life

48:38.933 --> 48:40.868
with blood on my hands

48:40.933 --> 48:43.168
from what you did.

48:46.332 --> 48:48.434
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

48:48.499 --> 48:51.668
Man, give me-- give me--
give me the gun.

48:51.733 --> 48:53.568
Give me the fucking gun.
Let her go.

48:53.632 --> 48:56.267
Let her go. Let her go.

48:57.299 --> 48:59.601
Get the fuck out of here.

48:59.666 --> 49:01.134
You got work to do.

49:02.833 --> 49:05.569
Be happy I'm gonna put this
motherfucker where he can be found.

49:05.632 --> 49:07.934
Why did you do this to him?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.102
Oh, man.

49:12.232 --> 49:14.400
Oh, and, hermano,

49:14.466 --> 49:17.101
you should thank Derek
for keeping us out of jail--

49:17.165 --> 49:19.433
all of us.

49:19.499 --> 49:22.235
I mean, really,
I mean, how well--

49:22.299 --> 49:25.869
how well do you really
know people anyway?

49:25.933 --> 49:27.734
Huh?

49:43.466 --> 49:46.001
Come on.

50:03.099 --> 50:05.901
Oh.

50:05.966 --> 50:07.901
Please just-- just take--

50:07.966 --> 50:09.801
just take care of him, please.

50:23.165 --> 50:25.333
Why did you do it, Maria? Why?

50:25.399 --> 50:27.167
Put that pinche gun away.

50:27.232 --> 50:28.833
You're not gonna do anything, pussy.

50:28.899 --> 50:31.401
You're a fucking pussy.
I hope your son doesn't end up like you.

50:31.466 --> 50:33.401
Eres un pedazo de mierda,
bueno para nada.

51:00.499 --> 51:02.467
This is bullshit.

51:03.899 --> 51:06.735
Listen, Bobby,
I understand how you feel, I do.

51:06.799 --> 51:08.233
Look, I don't understand
why we can't just

51:08.299 --> 51:10.100
bring him in on a murder charge.

51:10.165 --> 51:13.134
I mean, he shot Julian
right in front of my fucking face.

51:13.199 --> 51:15.100
- I understand that.
- I'll testify.

51:15.165 --> 51:18.735
All right? We can get
the Asian lady to be a second witness.

51:18.799 --> 51:20.800
Walk with me, son.

51:23.332 --> 51:26.334
A single murder charge
is a state conviction, all right?

51:26.399 --> 51:28.868
The FBI is not gonna risk blowing

51:28.933 --> 51:31.235
an undercover operation
that could take down

51:31.299 --> 51:34.502
the single largest drug trafficking
organization in North America

51:34.566 --> 51:36.301
- on simple murder charge.
- A simple murder charge?

51:36.366 --> 51:39.035
That's not what I meant.
Now I said I was sorry for our loss,

51:39.099 --> 51:41.067
and you need to fucking
understand this shit.

51:41.132 --> 51:43.067
Bigger picture, son.

51:43.132 --> 51:46.101
Look at this objectively.
We're a collective.

51:46.165 --> 51:48.534
That loss affects
each and every one of us.

51:50.299 --> 51:53.502
We can lock him up
for the rest of his life.

51:53.566 --> 51:55.834
And we will.

52:05.866 --> 52:08.235
Julian was my brother, man.

52:09.966 --> 52:12.335
I know he was, son.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.668
I mean, he's--

52:17.733 --> 52:20.569
he's the only family I have left.

52:25.232 --> 52:29.636
I mean, Jason can't just
walk the fucking streets

52:29.699 --> 52:31.300
and Julian's--

52:31.366 --> 52:33.735
Listen.
Listen to me, Bobby.

52:33.799 --> 52:35.667
You can end this.

52:36.699 --> 52:38.600
We gotta to do this the right way.

52:38.666 --> 52:40.534
If you're gonna get
emotional on me,

52:40.599 --> 52:42.667
I gotta yank you out of
this right now.

52:42.733 --> 52:44.601
I don't want Julian's death
to be in vain

52:44.666 --> 52:46.768
any fucking more than you do.
I don't want that,

52:46.833 --> 52:49.635
but we need to get this guy Jason
on federal charges--

52:49.699 --> 52:51.901
drug trafficking,
organized crime,

52:51.966 --> 52:54.034
multiple murder convictions.

52:54.099 --> 52:56.401
You want this motherfucker to go away
and never see the light of day?

52:56.466 --> 52:58.768
Is that what you want?
This is the way you do it.

52:58.833 --> 53:01.735
But you gotta look at me
and tell me you're capable.

53:03.199 --> 53:05.401
Look, I promise you something:

53:05.466 --> 53:07.901
if we don't pin anything on him...

53:10.165 --> 53:12.267
I will fucking end this.

53:30.733 --> 53:34.002
Aim, fire!

53:34.065 --> 53:35.800
Aim,

53:35.866 --> 53:37.267
fire!

53:37.332 --> 53:39.000
Aim, fire!

53:39.065 --> 53:40.766
Recover!

55:12.000 --> 55:13.134
Let's go.

57:29.399 --> 57:31.100
I'm so--

01:00:13.766 --> 01:00:15.701
Hello, Mr. Ramirez.

01:00:15.766 --> 01:00:17.801
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you.

01:00:17.866 --> 01:00:19.667
We've been expecting you.

01:00:19.733 --> 01:00:21.734
Please, this way.

01:00:24.733 --> 01:00:27.068
Well, it's about
a 20-minute drive to your hotel.

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:29.300
I'm sure they will be
serving dinner by then.

01:00:29.366 --> 01:00:32.602
Maybe you and your friend
would like to go out.

01:00:32.666 --> 01:00:34.367
There is a very--
how do you say?

01:00:34.432 --> 01:00:36.967
--crazy nightlife here in our city.

01:00:37.032 --> 01:00:38.133
Friend?

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:41.869
Yes, a gentleman
by the name of Derek.

01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:58.503
My eyes

01:00:58.566 --> 01:01:03.037
Follow you around the room

01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:08.068
And I

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.867
Only ever look

01:01:11.933 --> 01:01:15.469
At you

01:01:15.532 --> 01:01:19.168
The way you move

01:01:20.866 --> 01:01:25.070
Get a feeling I can't hide

01:01:26.733 --> 01:01:30.303
It's up to you

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:33.868
If we're gonna do this

01:01:33.933 --> 01:01:37.503
Tonight...

01:02:58.532 --> 01:03:01.534
What the fuck are you doing,
pendejo?

01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:04.368
Pinche seamstress or what?

01:03:04.432 --> 01:03:06.734
Can you bring in my dress?

01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:08.567
I'm losing weight.

01:03:13.132 --> 01:03:15.067
Hey.

01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:17.067
Hey, Derek.

01:03:17.132 --> 01:03:20.201
Look at me, shithead.

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:22.166
Just get out, Mom.
You're drunk.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:28.867
Why are you always sewing

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:31.468
that Cavaricci shit on your pants

01:03:31.532 --> 01:03:35.669
and those ducks from my
purse on your shoes?

01:03:35.733 --> 01:03:38.335
Maybe if we weren't so poor,
I wouldn't have to.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:40.834
Hey, I work hard for this family.

01:03:40.899 --> 01:03:43.534
You show me some respect.

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:45.334
On your back.

01:04:18.299 --> 01:04:21.902
Fucking shit!
I fucking hate this!

01:05:14.699 --> 01:05:16.333
Who the fuck are you?

01:05:18.299 --> 01:05:20.234
Look, I don't got time
for this shit, all right?

01:05:20.299 --> 01:05:22.434
I got a delivery from Nadie.

01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:25.534
What happened to Derek?

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:27.534
I don't know.

01:05:28.566 --> 01:05:29.967
So are you gonna let me in?

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:34.101
I look kind of stupid sitting
out here with a fucking duffel bag.

01:05:49.132 --> 01:05:51.234
So why'd they send you?
What happened to Derek?

01:05:52.733 --> 01:05:55.402
Yeah, it's like I said,
I don't know.

01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:58.202
Probably found a nice
piece of ass down in Mexico,

01:05:58.265 --> 01:06:00.734
missed his flight back, you know?

01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:03.468
A nice piece of ass, huh?

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:05.567
Yeah, well
you know Derek,' right?

01:06:05.632 --> 01:06:07.633
Yeah.

01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:09.333
I gotta make a call.

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:11.267
Why don't you grab a beer?
I'll just finish this in a bit.

01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:12.833
You know, it's cool.
I'm gonna go and--

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:16.369
Like I said, have a beer.
Nico, get this dude a beer.

01:06:37.399 --> 01:06:39.167
He's here.

01:06:39.232 --> 01:06:41.500
Yeah. Yeah, he brought it.

01:06:48.566 --> 01:06:51.335
So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

01:06:51.399 --> 01:06:53.534
Shit, I've known him my whole life.

01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:55.567
Huh.

01:06:58.232 --> 01:06:59.933
Funny, I've never met you before.

01:07:02.299 --> 01:07:04.434
Yeah, it's funny.

01:07:04.499 --> 01:07:06.500
No, bro.

01:07:06.566 --> 01:07:08.167
Sit down.
Take it easy.

01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:11.034
It's gonna be a minute.
You're gonna do a few bumps, right?

01:07:11.099 --> 01:07:12.533
Uh, you know what?

01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:14.300
I had a late night last night.
I'm cool.

01:07:14.366 --> 01:07:16.334
Two it is.

01:07:19.099 --> 01:07:22.035
So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

01:07:22.099 --> 01:07:25.368
Shit, hell of a lot longer than you.

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.367
I told you I was cool, man.

01:07:33.432 --> 01:07:36.334
I think you need a little pick-me-up.

01:07:36.399 --> 01:07:38.367
Come on, just one line.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.134
What's the problem?

01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:54.668
Why don't you tell your boy
over here to back the fuck off?

01:07:54.733 --> 01:07:56.668
Hey, calm down, Bobby.
No need to get out of hand.

01:07:56.733 --> 01:07:58.734
Bobby, huh?

01:08:00.432 --> 01:08:01.900
I never told you my name.

01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:47.600
Like this, huh?

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:54.035
No, not like this.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.501
Son of a bitch.

01:09:45.866 --> 01:09:46.832
Fuck.

01:09:53.532 --> 01:09:55.333
Fuck!

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.569
Motherfucker's got a boney face.

01:09:59.632 --> 01:10:01.700
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:01.766 --> 01:10:04.702
Huh? Fucking reading comics?

01:10:08.799 --> 01:10:10.167
Give me the picture.

01:10:10.232 --> 01:10:12.167
Give me the fucking phone.

01:10:12.232 --> 01:10:13.600
Come on.

01:10:21.466 --> 01:10:23.234
Will you come pick this up?

01:10:23.299 --> 01:10:27.569
Hey, shithead,
come pick this shit up.

01:10:30.065 --> 01:10:32.000
I swear to God, man,

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.000
if my sister wasn't having
your fucking baby, man,

01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:36.233
I would kill you right now,
you know that?

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:39.402
Oh, yeah, I'd stab you
with my fucking gun, man.

01:10:39.466 --> 01:10:41.634
You'd stab me with your fucking gun?
That makes sense.

01:10:41.699 --> 01:10:42.733
- That's good.
- Yes, stab you with my--

01:10:42.799 --> 01:10:44.367
shut the fuck up, man.

01:10:44.432 --> 01:10:46.233
Fucking kill you.

01:10:50.866 --> 01:10:53.034
How could you do this, man?

01:10:53.099 --> 01:10:55.301
You sadistic fuck. Huh?

01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:58.035
You're a sick motherfucker, man.
You know that?

01:10:58.099 --> 01:11:00.334
Right?

01:11:00.399 --> 01:11:03.001
Huh? You're sick.

01:11:04.499 --> 01:11:08.135
How am I supposed
to make you look like this, huh?

01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:17.635
Hey, get off your fucking ass, man.

01:11:17.699 --> 01:11:19.167
It's your shot.

01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:21.667
Let's go.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.302
Fuck.

01:11:28.499 --> 01:11:30.534
Fuck.

01:11:30.599 --> 01:11:33.601
What did you get
yourself into, huh?

01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:37.568
Do you think we enjoy this?

01:11:37.632 --> 01:11:40.501
I'm a cop, okay?

01:11:40.566 --> 01:11:43.669
This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

01:11:49.366 --> 01:11:52.001
Actually,
maybe it hurts you more.

01:11:58.632 --> 01:11:59.766
What are you doing?

01:12:02.232 --> 01:12:04.200
Pick him up.

01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:07.434
Pick him up.

01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:31.800
You know, I...

01:12:33.032 --> 01:12:35.634
I should kill you right now.

01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:37.667
You know?

01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:40.969
I should fucking kill
you right now.

01:12:41.032 --> 01:12:43.934
No one would care.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.335
No one would cry.

01:12:46.399 --> 01:12:49.769
And no one would ever
even miss you.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.869
But I-- I can't.

01:12:59.933 --> 01:13:01.701
I can't.

01:13:01.766 --> 01:13:04.835
Why-- why can't I?
Why the fuck can't I?

01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:09.734
I don't-- I don't--
I mean, I don't care.

01:13:12.299 --> 01:13:15.068
I don't care.
I don't-- I don't--

01:13:15.132 --> 01:13:18.168
it's not gonna make me sad.

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:21.768
Maybe--
maybe it's because--

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:24.302
maybe it's 'cause I want to know--

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.668
I want to know some things.

01:13:36.466 --> 01:13:38.701
Remember that time we held up

01:13:38.766 --> 01:13:41.735
that taqueria on-- on Mission?

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:45.233
Remember that?

01:13:46.599 --> 01:13:48.534
You and Julian

01:13:48.599 --> 01:13:51.902
were so fucking scared.

01:13:51.966 --> 01:13:53.901
You guys were always

01:13:53.966 --> 01:13:56.335
a bunch of little fucking bitches.

01:14:01.866 --> 01:14:04.969
And that-- that got me thinking.

01:14:06.599 --> 01:14:09.802
What makes a better cop...

01:14:12.332 --> 01:14:14.634
than, you know,

01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:16.667
a little bitch with a gun?

01:14:19.099 --> 01:14:21.267
You know, I had to go
back to that place

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.600
and clean up that mess
all by myself.

01:14:27.733 --> 01:14:30.802
True story.
I wouldn't lie about that shit.

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.168
I would not lie about that shit.

01:14:33.232 --> 01:14:35.334
That shit was scary as fuck.

01:14:35.399 --> 01:14:40.003
I was scared.
That shit was horrible.

01:14:42.566 --> 01:14:45.068
I'm only gonna ask you once.

01:14:52.399 --> 01:14:54.400
Are you-- are you--

01:14:55.632 --> 01:14:58.401
are you a cop?

01:14:58.466 --> 01:15:01.101
He doesn't have
the huevos to be a cop.

01:15:06.766 --> 01:15:10.236
Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.603
You-- I mean, you really really
fucked up Derek, man.

01:15:18.666 --> 01:15:22.703
I mean,
he is hurt pretty fucking bad.

01:15:22.766 --> 01:15:27.203
Why, man? Huh?

01:15:29.899 --> 01:15:31.867
He grabbed my dick, bro.

01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:39.768
He grabbed your dick.

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:41.901
Oh shit, that's...

01:15:43.432 --> 01:15:45.901
that's funny.

01:15:45.966 --> 01:15:48.335
That's fucking funny.

01:15:50.399 --> 01:15:52.734
You want to know
what else is funny?

01:15:55.766 --> 01:15:57.567
Yo!

01:16:05.599 --> 01:16:06.766
Derek, I--

01:16:11.499 --> 01:16:14.401
You wore a mask
to cover up your pretty little face,

01:16:14.466 --> 01:16:17.635
but I saw your eyes, my friend.

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:20.068
I'll never forget these eyes.

01:16:23.332 --> 01:16:25.634
Let me ask you something:

01:16:25.699 --> 01:16:28.134
Is the pain you
inflicted on my face

01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:30.134
still on your hands?

01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:31.500
Huh?

01:16:31.566 --> 01:16:34.568
Answer me,
you piece of shit!

01:16:50.366 --> 01:16:52.701
Why did you do it, man?

01:16:54.132 --> 01:16:55.233
Hmm?

01:16:55.299 --> 01:16:57.467
Once you found out
Julian was a narc,

01:16:57.532 --> 01:16:59.700
you should have been happy
he was gone.

01:17:01.733 --> 01:17:04.569
Now I hate to admit it,
bro, but I--

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:07.701
I really really really
really loved Julian.

01:17:08.766 --> 01:17:10.767
I did. I did.

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:14.269
But, I mean, I had
no other options, really.

01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:22.001
I mean, this--
this dumb shit right here--

01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:24.000
I could care less
what the fuck you do to him.

01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:25.833
I mean, shit, man, if you knew

01:17:25.899 --> 01:17:27.300
how much trouble he caused me, you--

01:17:28.366 --> 01:17:30.334
I-- I should thank you
for disciplining

01:17:30.399 --> 01:17:31.900
this motherfucker.
I should.

01:17:33.199 --> 01:17:34.900
Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:36.766 --> 01:17:40.102
I want-- I want to know, Bobby.

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:44.601
I want to know.

01:17:44.666 --> 01:17:47.068
- Just fucking shoot him al--
- Would you shut the fuck up?

01:17:47.132 --> 01:17:49.000
Get the fuck out of here.

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.833
Rodriguez, get this
motherfucker in his car.

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:53.034
- I'm just saying.
- What about Derek?

01:17:53.099 --> 01:17:55.501
Leave this fucking cripple
here with me.

01:17:55.566 --> 01:17:57.000
All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

01:17:57.065 --> 01:17:59.200
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

01:18:00.766 --> 01:18:02.534
Damn it.

01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:06.599
Fuck.

01:18:10.432 --> 01:18:13.168
I need you to tell me, Bobby.

01:18:13.232 --> 01:18:16.234
I won't be mad.

01:18:18.933 --> 01:18:22.569
How well do you really
know somebody, Jason?

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:25.968
What? What?

01:18:26.032 --> 01:18:28.868
Be-- be-- be clear, motherfucker.

01:18:28.933 --> 01:18:32.069
- How well do you really know somebody?
- What?

01:18:32.132 --> 01:18:34.067
What?

01:18:34.132 --> 01:18:36.267
I'm a narc.

01:18:36.332 --> 01:18:39.334
I'm a motherfucking federal agent,
you dumbass.

01:18:39.399 --> 01:18:42.468
I did something with my life.

01:18:42.532 --> 01:18:45.468
And you-- all you did was hurt

01:18:45.532 --> 01:18:47.867
and steal and take.

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:50.201
You make me fucking sick.
You know that?

01:18:50.265 --> 01:18:53.267
Wow wow wow
wow wow.

01:18:53.332 --> 01:18:56.101
Oh, shit, man, I--

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:02.567
I was just trying to scare you

01:19:02.632 --> 01:19:05.668
for getting Derek
and fucking my chick, but--

01:19:05.733 --> 01:19:07.134
but--

01:19:10.632 --> 01:19:13.401
I don't even really know
what's fucking going on.

01:19:13.466 --> 01:19:16.035
What the fuck?

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.468
Oh, fuck.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:33.502
Derek, have at him.

01:19:33.566 --> 01:19:37.403
Come on,
fucking have at him.

01:19:37.466 --> 01:19:39.267
Come on.

01:19:40.699 --> 01:19:43.501
Oh, fuck.

01:19:43.566 --> 01:19:45.067
Fuck.

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.568
What's taking you so long,
dumbass? Come on.

01:19:53.632 --> 01:19:56.267
What's taking you so fucking long?

01:19:56.332 --> 01:19:58.500
Hey.

01:19:58.566 --> 01:20:02.770
Hey, pull the fucking trigger!

01:20:02.833 --> 01:20:05.168
Oh, you're fucking useless, man.

01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:07.500
Oh, you are fucking useless.

01:20:07.566 --> 01:20:09.334
- I'm useless?
- Yeah, you're fucking--

01:20:09.399 --> 01:20:10.967
- I'm useless?
- Yeah.

01:20:11.032 --> 01:20:12.299
- No, fuck you!
- Whoa whoa.

01:20:12.366 --> 01:20:13.967
- Fuck you, man!
- Whoa whoa.

01:20:14.032 --> 01:20:16.200
- Fuck you, Jason!
- Whoa whoa whoa. Hey hey hey.

01:20:16.265 --> 01:20:18.400
Hey, back the fuck up, man!
Back the--

01:20:18.466 --> 01:20:20.734
- Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
- You know what?

01:20:20.799 --> 01:20:22.967
My whole fucking life
all you've ever done

01:20:23.032 --> 01:20:25.067
is tell me
how stupid I am.

01:20:25.132 --> 01:20:27.167
Guess what:
I'm not stupid, Jason.

01:20:27.232 --> 01:20:28.866
No. I'm sorry, Nadie, right?

01:20:28.933 --> 01:20:30.868
That's what you like
to be called, right? Nadie?

01:20:30.933 --> 01:20:33.602
What kind of stupid-ass name
is that anyway, huh?

01:20:33.666 --> 01:20:35.734
Shit, if anyone should be
called Nadie, it's me.

01:20:35.799 --> 01:20:38.368
Because I'm always
treated like no one!

01:20:38.432 --> 01:20:39.866
I got a brain.

01:20:39.933 --> 01:20:42.468
I can think.
I know how shit's run, man.

01:20:42.532 --> 01:20:44.767
I know how it's run.
I've been running it.

01:20:44.833 --> 01:20:46.501
I don't need you.

01:20:46.566 --> 01:20:48.067
- Hey, hey, hey, man!
- I can do this without you.

01:20:48.132 --> 01:20:50.067
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:57.536
Oh. Oh, fuck.

01:20:57.599 --> 01:21:01.336
My life's gonna be
a whole lot happier being a boss.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:04.435
Fuck!

01:21:04.499 --> 01:21:06.834
Hey, please.
Please, man.

01:21:06.899 --> 01:21:08.967
I will make it
all right, man.

01:21:09.032 --> 01:21:11.701
Hey, please.

01:21:16.466 --> 01:21:19.068
Please stop talking.

01:21:19.132 --> 01:21:21.133
Fuck!

01:21:21.199 --> 01:21:23.167
Just let me finish.

01:21:26.265 --> 01:21:28.033
It's about time.

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:34.402
No no no no no no no!

01:21:34.466 --> 01:21:37.402
Damn it.

01:21:37.466 --> 01:21:39.601
He said stay in the fucking car!

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:42.035
Derek, Derek.

01:21:42.099 --> 01:21:44.067
Shit.

01:21:47.065 --> 01:21:49.534
Derek, Derek, please.

01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:51.400
Please, man, Derek.

01:22:12.199 --> 01:22:13.667
Shit.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.200
Derek.

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:43.235
Derek.

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:52.701
You gotta un-cuff me, man.

01:22:57.799 --> 01:22:59.767
Bobby.

01:23:01.599 --> 01:23:03.867
You remember that time that we ate

01:23:03.933 --> 01:23:05.934
at that joint off of Mission, right?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.969
The one--
the one that Jason wanted to rob?

01:23:09.032 --> 01:23:11.401
You remember that, right?

01:23:11.466 --> 01:23:14.001
I do.

01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:17.567
I think about it a lot.

01:23:19.632 --> 01:23:22.201
I think about it a lot.

01:23:22.265 --> 01:23:24.900
And I remember-- ow.

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:28.602
I remember how you and Julian--

01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:31.001
you guys didn't want to do anything.

01:23:34.099 --> 01:23:36.034
And me-- I--

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:37.700
I just wanted
to fit in.

01:23:40.466 --> 01:23:44.203
I mean, I was never
the cool guy, you know?

01:23:44.265 --> 01:23:47.534
I-- I never had the nice shoes.

01:23:47.599 --> 01:23:49.767
I never had money.

01:23:52.399 --> 01:23:55.769
I just wanted to feel important, man.

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:58.368
Fuck important.

01:23:58.432 --> 01:24:00.600
I just wanted to be accepted.

01:24:02.899 --> 01:24:07.236
You-- I mean, you had Julian,
you know?

01:24:07.299 --> 01:24:10.168
And Jason--
he never needed nobody.

01:24:13.532 --> 01:24:15.533
But me--

01:24:15.599 --> 01:24:16.800
Me--

01:24:20.065 --> 01:24:22.033
I did.

01:24:26.466 --> 01:24:28.434
I did.

01:24:28.499 --> 01:24:31.068
Where was
my best buddy, huh?

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:34.401
Where was my best buddy?

01:24:39.933 --> 01:24:42.235
And now shit's all fucked up, man.

01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:45.769
Shit's-- shit's all fucked up.

01:24:49.466 --> 01:24:52.602
And I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

01:24:55.899 --> 01:24:58.101
I don't know what to do.

01:25:22.499 --> 01:25:25.702
You guys were right, man.

01:25:25.766 --> 01:25:27.501
You guys were so right.

01:25:29.899 --> 01:25:32.101
That poor girl, man--

01:25:36.666 --> 01:25:38.968
she haunts my dreams.

01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:43.835
And that cook-- that cook--

01:25:43.899 --> 01:25:46.067
he didn't have to die.

01:25:47.532 --> 01:25:49.467
He wasn't gonna
tell nobody.

01:25:49.532 --> 01:25:51.700
He was an illegal.

01:25:51.766 --> 01:25:54.602
She haunts
my dreams too, bro.

01:25:54.666 --> 01:25:56.000
Yeah?

01:25:58.566 --> 01:26:00.734
I mean, that's the reason
that Julian and I--

01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:03.434
you know, the reason we went
and took the road that we took.

01:26:07.032 --> 01:26:09.267
But you have to know

01:26:09.332 --> 01:26:12.234
that one day doesn't define a man.

01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:16.434
Right?

01:26:18.432 --> 01:26:21.034
You have to un-cuff me,
bro. Come on.

01:26:45.432 --> 01:26:49.235
Man, I appreciate you, Bobby,

01:26:49.299 --> 01:26:52.068
I really do.

01:26:54.232 --> 01:26:56.934
Jason--

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.802
he never really cared about me.

01:27:02.933 --> 01:27:05.435
He just wanted
to treat me like an ass.

01:27:05.499 --> 01:27:06.766
Oh, shit.

01:27:09.132 --> 01:27:10.933
Sorry.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.035
He's sensitive.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.204
But you and I
both know, man,

01:27:29.265 --> 01:27:30.966
as soon as we
walk out of here,

01:27:31.032 --> 01:27:33.434
I'm gonna be popped
with all kinds of shit.

01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:36.602
No. No.

01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:39.902
Yeah, come on.

01:27:39.966 --> 01:27:42.201
Look, you don't have
to do this, Derek.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.035
I'm gonna miss you, bro.

01:27:54.032 --> 01:27:56.067
Dios.

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:21.435
Bobby.

01:28:23.099 --> 01:28:25.601
- I'm so sorry.
- Take the handcuffs off, please.

01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:26.867
I'm sorry.

01:28:28.733 --> 01:28:30.935
You gotta believe me.
I'm not like this.

01:28:35.933 --> 01:28:37.801
I just knew this would happen.

01:28:37.866 --> 01:28:39.634
Jason was just too crazy.

01:28:39.699 --> 01:28:42.401
And then when I got home,
I found this note.

01:28:44.799 --> 01:28:46.500
What note?

01:28:49.666 --> 01:28:52.235
He thought I was
leaving him for you.

01:28:54.199 --> 01:28:57.702
I'm just-- I'm glad
I overheard him talking the other night.

01:28:59.399 --> 01:29:02.034
I'm so sorry, Bobby.
I'm so sorry.

01:29:04.265 --> 01:29:06.233
I'm sorry.

01:29:13.165 --> 01:29:14.766
- You have to go.
- No.

01:29:14.833 --> 01:29:16.267
Yeah, you have to go.

01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:18.867
- Go. It's okay.
- No.

01:29:18.933 --> 01:29:20.934
Go. It's okay.

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:05.766
Bobby?

01:30:19.833 --> 01:30:21.534
Bobby?

01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:25.033
Are you okay?

01:30:29.632 --> 01:30:31.900
Is everyone here accounted for?

01:30:31.966 --> 01:30:33.934
Yeah.

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:40.934
The captain put a tracker on you
when you were a no-show.

01:30:43.866 --> 01:30:45.834
I guess you owe him one.

01:30:53.733 --> 01:30:55.868
Can I get some help over here?

01:31:07.733 --> 01:31:10.102
Let's clear it.

01:32:07.966 --> 01:32:11.202
I remember when my father
used to take me to play catch.

01:32:14.132 --> 01:32:16.534
He used to keep me out
till the sun went down,

01:32:16.599 --> 01:32:18.834
take me home, make me wash up

01:32:18.899 --> 01:32:21.434
and then go straight to bed.

01:32:21.499 --> 01:32:23.834
I wish every father
would go that far

01:32:23.899 --> 01:32:27.035
just to make sure their kids didn't
make the same mistakes they did.

01:32:54.599 --> 01:32:57.668
Julian used to get on my case
about my attitude.

01:32:57.733 --> 01:32:59.668
He told me I should be happy

01:32:59.733 --> 01:33:03.002
for all the things
God had given me.

01:33:03.065 --> 01:33:05.033
Now I know he was right.

01:33:08.566 --> 01:33:10.834
I was lucky to have a brother
like him.

01:33:27.566 --> 01:33:29.868
Happy birthday, bro.

01:34:23.733 --> 01:34:24.934
A great man once told me

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.168
that one day doesn't define a person.

01:34:28.499 --> 01:34:30.500
He was right.

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:35.069
We all have the ability
to create our own legacy.

01:35:34.499 --> 01:35:36.100
What's up, Cap?

01:35:36.165 --> 01:35:39.101
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

01:35:39.165 --> 01:35:41.367
What's going on?

01:35:41.432 --> 01:35:44.268
You were pretty tight
with Jason's crew, right?

01:35:44.332 --> 01:35:46.100
Yeah.
What do you need to know?

01:35:46.165 --> 01:35:47.933
Anybody you can think of
that would be capable

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.001
of taking over that operation?

01:35:52.899 --> 01:35:55.301
Why are you asking?

01:35:58.065 --> 01:36:00.734
Nadie was just a name,
Bobby.

01:36:03.532 --> 01:36:05.567
And somebody's still using it.

01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:24.134
Oh, oh, oh

01:37:24.199 --> 01:37:26.200
I used to be on the block all day

01:37:26.265 --> 01:37:29.301
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

01:37:29.366 --> 01:37:31.601
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

01:37:31.666 --> 01:37:34.235
They still want to lock me up, oh

01:37:34.299 --> 01:37:37.168
They want to give me life

01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:39.467
Oh, oh, oh

01:37:39.532 --> 01:37:42.601
They want to give me life

01:37:42.666 --> 01:37:45.735
- All right, yeah
- They want to give me life

01:37:45.799 --> 01:37:48.301
All right, I wear the shoe
if the shoe fits

01:37:48.366 --> 01:37:51.202
'Cause we was born
with ambitions of being rich

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:54.134
We was born with ambitions
of hitting licks

01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:56.768
My mama said it'd
be days like this now

01:37:56.833 --> 01:37:59.335
This here was Bugsy shit,
that real Bugsy shit

01:37:59.399 --> 01:38:01.968
Oh, yeah, we copyright,
them niggas counterfeit

01:38:02.032 --> 01:38:04.667
See, them niggas just
ballin' in they daydreams

01:38:04.733 --> 01:38:07.802
Me and Norm finna go
and cop the Saleen

01:38:07.866 --> 01:38:10.501
Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

01:38:10.566 --> 01:38:12.968
We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

01:38:13.032 --> 01:38:15.634
Where the critics at?
They had a lot to say

01:38:15.699 --> 01:38:18.268
I guess these niggas mad,
old and out of date

01:38:18.332 --> 01:38:21.268
See, me, I'm like Hov,
I don't write shit

01:38:21.332 --> 01:38:23.934
Took my dogs
to Hollywood, Mike Vick

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.502
You riding the shit,
if you riding it right

01:38:26.566 --> 01:38:29.535
If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

01:38:29.599 --> 01:38:31.767
I used to be on the
block all day

01:38:31.833 --> 01:38:34.869
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

01:38:34.933 --> 01:38:37.168
I flip that,
did hits and I'm on

01:38:37.232 --> 01:38:39.801
They still want to
lock me up, oh

01:38:39.866 --> 01:38:42.735
They want to give me life

01:38:42.799 --> 01:38:45.034
Oh, oh, oh

01:38:45.099 --> 01:38:48.168
They want to give me life

01:38:48.232 --> 01:38:49.466
Oh, oh, oh

01:38:49.532 --> 01:38:51.300
They want to give me life

01:38:51.366 --> 01:38:53.968
All right, I wear the
crown if the crown fit

01:38:54.032 --> 01:38:56.334
But all kings get killed,
so I don't wear it much

01:38:56.399 --> 01:38:59.335
I hit the stage,
city to city, and tear it up

01:38:59.399 --> 01:39:01.934
Straight raw lyrics,
I put my heart in it

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.002
But nowadays they don't like it
when you spit the truth

01:39:05.065 --> 01:39:07.333
They want that bubblegum shit
that they're used to

01:39:07.399 --> 01:39:10.068
See, these niggas in the game
for the wrong reason

01:39:10.132 --> 01:39:13.001
Sitting on the bench
for the whole season

01:39:13.065 --> 01:39:15.500
Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

01:39:15.566 --> 01:39:18.435
We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

01:39:18.499 --> 01:39:21.101
The powers that be,
I see, was trying to hate

01:39:21.165 --> 01:39:23.734
But Bugsy always on time,
never late

01:39:23.799 --> 01:39:26.501
I'm riding with it,
these other niggas just ride around

01:39:26.566 --> 01:39:29.135
Never leave evidence,
never write it down

01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:32.101
If you riding this shit,
if you riding it right

01:39:32.165 --> 01:39:34.600
If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

01:39:34.666 --> 01:39:37.001
I used to be on the block all day

01:39:37.065 --> 01:39:40.101
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

01:39:40.165 --> 01:39:42.400
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

01:39:42.466 --> 01:39:45.035
They still want to lock me up, oh

01:39:45.099 --> 01:39:47.968
They want to give me life

01:39:48.032 --> 01:39:50.267
Oh, oh, oh

01:39:50.332 --> 01:39:53.401
They want to give me life

01:39:53.466 --> 01:39:54.900
Oh, oh, oh

01:39:54.966 --> 01:39:57.768
They want to give me life.
