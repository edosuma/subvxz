00:07.460 --> 00:10.410
'I'm actually frightened
to walk the streets now.

00:10.460 --> 00:11.610
'Not just in the night, but in the day.

00:11.660 --> 00:15.410
'I'm actually scared to walk
down my own street. It's scary.'

00:15.460 --> 00:18.410
'I don't feel safe. It's just
knowing these people are out there.

00:18.460 --> 00:21.410
'I mean, they could be anyone, the
man sat next to you on the bus.'

00:21.460 --> 00:25.980
'Crime is everywhere and the
police can't do anything about it.'

01:30.460 --> 01:32.410
- Morning, boss.
- Good morning.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.460
- Oh, God, what's he doing back?
- Morning.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.460
Sir.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.410
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:43.460 --> 01:44.410
I was never really sure

01:44.460 --> 01:46.410
about that whole algorithm
spreadsheet fandango.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.410
- That's why they got rid of him.
- Here's some good news, though.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.410
I've found a very
promising young Aussie CC.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.250
He's making mincemeat of the
crime stats down in Adelaide.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.460
- Are you kidding me?
- No, he's brilliant. Look.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.410
What are you doing here?
Leave something behind?

02:01.460 --> 02:04.410
Yeah. My desk.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.610
I don't think so.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.410
This goes back to the
'80s. It's inventory.

02:08.460 --> 02:12.410
Are you in receipt of my written
resignation per my T of Es?

02:12.460 --> 02:14.410
Cos I don't have a notice
of dismissal from you.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.930
Until one of those things happens,

02:15.980 --> 02:18.410
that's my desk you're crumbling
your cookies and tea on.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.410
You told me you'd
accepted a role in Houston.

02:20.460 --> 02:22.410
You quit, Bill.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.460
I just unquit.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.410
'I don't want to be a
foreigner in my own country.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.410
'I live in England. I'm
an English person.'

02:29.460 --> 02:31.410
'I remember when Boston was a community.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.930
'Now we're no longer in control.'

02:32.980 --> 02:35.410
'We earn money, we pay
taxes, why do you blame us?'

02:35.460 --> 02:36.410
Voila!

02:36.460 --> 02:39.410
Phase two, the Hixon parallax.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.410
I have no idea what you
think you've just done.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.410
When new cases come in,
where do you put 'em?

02:44.460 --> 02:46.410
On top of the old ones.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.820
Ensuring that the old ones,
the tough ones, get forgotten.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.410
What's on top now?

02:53.460 --> 02:55.410
The Holy Arsonist.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.410
Four church halls, three C of E schools

02:57.460 --> 02:59.410
and the whale in the Wash Aquatic Centre.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.410
Great, what's next?

03:02.460 --> 03:04.410
The Threekingham Monster.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.410
Yeah. Likes to kill old
women in their beds.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.760
Who says crime can't be fun?

03:08.060 --> 03:08.750
Next.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.500
The Boston Bandit.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.450
- That's a good name.
- You're full of shit.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.250
This shit works. Cops don't want
to pay attention to these cases,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.410
they want to ignore them.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.410
Like a bill that slips
behind the refrigerator

03:22.460 --> 03:25.410
that they don't want to pay.
Well, now they can't ignore them.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.410
They're going to see these red
cases morning, noon and night.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.450
Sake...

03:28.500 --> 03:30.460
And they're gonna have to pay the bill.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.250
What a dick.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.410
Sorry, Sarge.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.410
Erm...

04:25.460 --> 04:26.410
You were the SIO for the Bandit.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.410
We've been told to familiarise
ourselves with the red cases.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.460
Yeardsley, isn't it?

04:32.460 --> 04:34.410
The Bandit.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.410
Five armed robberies in
four-and-a-half years.

04:36.460 --> 04:40.410
Isolated minimarts and sub-post offices.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.410
No prints, but we've got a DNA
profile off his getaway car.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.250
And that was after the Claxby robbery?

04:46.300 --> 04:48.410
Claxby was a mess.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.410
He shot the postmaster in the leg

04:50.460 --> 04:53.410
and collided with another driver
three miles out on the B327.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.410
Eric John Ross.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.410
From his injuries, it seems
Eric got out of his car

04:57.460 --> 04:59.410
after the smash and the Bandit...

04:59.460 --> 05:01.410
Ran over him repeatedly and
mashed him to porridge.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.410
He's thorough like that.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.410
He wasn't going to leave Eric
Ross alive to identify him.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.410
You can keep following
me if you like, Muriel,

05:07.460 --> 05:08.410
but you're gonna end up in the gents.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.410
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, sir.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.410
Thank you.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.460
I've heard good things
about you, DC Yeardsley.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.090
People talk about good cops and bad cops.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.410
But in my experience, it's them and us.

05:21.460 --> 05:25.460
Cops and annoying fuckers with
whiteboards and red markers.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.610
'Right, then, for anyone
coming in or out of Boston

05:33.660 --> 05:36.410
'this week, you're gonna hear
the music of the Piano Man.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.410
'He's a homeless bloke...'

05:37.460 --> 05:40.410
'I tell you, this shows us
there's more to homeless people

05:40.460 --> 05:41.410
'than a sleeping bag.'

05:41.460 --> 05:44.410
'There's 320,000 homeless
people in this country...'

05:44.460 --> 05:46.410
This guy's a genius.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.410
He's a loser.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.610
I can't believe you let
me quit piano lessons.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.460
Hang on!

05:52.500 --> 05:54.460
Hang on...

05:57.660 --> 06:01.410
"I will never blame Dad for letting
me quit the lame-ass piano.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.410
"Love, Kelsey."

06:02.460 --> 06:05.410
I was 11. Who listens to an 11-year-old?

06:05.460 --> 06:07.410
You really are a shitty parent.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.460
Excuse me.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.250
And if we are actually staying,

06:12.300 --> 06:14.300
you might actually unpack Mom's things.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.560
Are you all right, love?

06:34.300 --> 06:35.980
What are you doing here, Krasnov?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.460
Ah. So cute.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.460
What do you want?

06:46.460 --> 06:48.450
200 grand in debt, this little farm.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.460
Yeah, I'm sorting that.

06:52.460 --> 06:53.660
I bought the debt.

06:56.460 --> 06:57.460
Why did you do that?

07:00.460 --> 07:03.930
They shouldn't have to leave
their home, your mum and dad.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.460
No, I don't want any favours off you.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.410
'Nobody knows his name,

07:20.460 --> 07:21.410
'nobody knows where he comes from.'

07:21.460 --> 07:24.410
'He's like Boston's Beethoven, isn't he?'

07:24.460 --> 07:25.460
'Does he speak?'

07:33.460 --> 07:36.610
'My mate Laura reckons he's
one of them amnesiacs.'

07:36.660 --> 07:39.410
These are the personnel
files you requested.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.410
Wait a minute, I said I wanted a
breakdown of all staff and officers.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.410
And anyone else you can cut cheaply.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.410
Yeah, I know what you asked
for. Find it yourself.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.410
That's a terrible noise.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.250
Oh, that? That's the Romanian
bloke from the train station.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.770
East Midlands Rail have
him on Facebook Live.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.410
Child prodigy, apparently.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.410
A cleaner reckons he's a Finnish amnesiac.

07:56.460 --> 07:57.410
Who gives a shit?

07:57.460 --> 07:59.460
Wow, not a music lover, then.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.460
Are you all right?

08:08.500 --> 08:11.460
I never talked to my
daughter about her mother.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.060
The time was never right, and...

08:14.820 --> 08:18.460
Now do you think if I open that box,
it's a good thing or a bad thing?

08:19.460 --> 08:22.410
Well, in my experience, we have 'em
between the ages of three and eight.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.410
Before three, they don't
know what you're saying.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.410
After eight, they don't
care. So, whatever you do...

08:26.460 --> 08:30.460
Like letting her quit the piano,
so she's not reminded of her mother.

08:33.460 --> 08:36.460
Look, I know it was you
that sent the video.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.960
You don't like me. I would
have done the same thing.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.929
But I'd like to know where you got it.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.410
So would I.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.460
But the e-mail address didn't trace.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.410
Look, I didn't send it
cos I don't like you.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.410
I mean, obviously, I don't like you.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.860
I sent it because I know
you're bad for this place.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.410
'I've been three times to see him.'

09:03.460 --> 09:05.410
'Do you fancy him?'

09:05.460 --> 09:07.410
'I think he's quite good-looking

09:07.460 --> 09:09.660
'if he'd just smarten
himself up a little bit.'

09:12.460 --> 09:14.410
Why don't you play something we know?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.410
This is fucking rubbish.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.410
Change it.

09:31.460 --> 09:32.410
Argh! Argh!

09:32.460 --> 09:34.460
Argh! Get off me!

09:36.460 --> 09:37.410
Urgh!

09:37.460 --> 09:38.460
Shit!

09:42.460 --> 09:44.910
"Police beat up street musician."

09:44.960 --> 09:46.910
Wild Bill, hey?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.910
- Sorry?
- Christ...

09:48.960 --> 09:50.910
Have you seen social media, hey?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.910
#Fascist Pigs.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.910
#Free Piano Man.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.910
#That's what you get for hiring a
Yank with a reputation for violence.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.910
Just a minor pain in my ass.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.910
Arse.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.750
With an "R".

10:03.800 --> 10:06.700
You want to stay in the country,
learn the bloody language.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.960
And clear up all this shite.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.430
So, you really don't remember your name?

10:29.480 --> 10:32.960
I told you, the first thing that
I do remember, I was on that bus.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.910
Wow.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.960
Next thing I know, I was in the sea.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.320
Shall we get some air?

10:45.960 --> 10:46.910
Yes.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.750
We're not charging you.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.960
We want to help. You're a missing person.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.910
But I'm not missing, am I?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.640
I'm here.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.960
We could run your DNA through
the national register.

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
DNA?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.960
Can I think about it?

11:09.960 --> 11:10.910
'He won't do it.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.910
'Of course.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.910
'There's a lot of reasons someone
might not want their DNA taken.'

11:15.960 --> 11:17.910
Yeah. Cos they're hiding something.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.910
Yeah, or he's justifiably nervous.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.590
You know, there could be all
sorts of people waiting for him.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.910
Good people, bad people...

11:24.960 --> 11:26.910
Victims, accomplices...

11:26.960 --> 11:29.060
- Or a wife and kids.
- Buried in the backyard.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.590
We know he has a temper.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.910
Yeah, he does seem troubled, but...

11:33.960 --> 11:36.430
That's the fugue state thing, right?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.910
- His amnesia.
- He's running from something.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.910
Why else would he wash up here?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.160
You don't like him.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.520
It would just be very helpful to
me if he were guilty of something.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.910
I suppose, if he doesn't
want his DNA taking,

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
there's not much we can do about it.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.270
Excuse me?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.910
I'm looking for TCR Max.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.910
It's a biotech start-up.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.430
Google sent me here.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.960
Google's always right.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.910
I'm Max. But I'm not
customer facing tonight.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.910
We're closed. Anyway,
my blood glucose is 140.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.910
I'm the only genomicist in Lincs
for thoroughbred profiling.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.910
So, what are you?

12:27.960 --> 12:28.910
Stud?

12:28.960 --> 12:29.910
Racer?

12:29.960 --> 12:31.910
A sperm broker, yeah?

12:31.960 --> 12:32.910
A sperm...?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.910
Er, no.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.910
I'm a cop.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.320
And as you say, you have the
only DNA lab east of Grantham.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.910
If you can DNA Seabiscuit...

12:42.960 --> 12:45.800
you shouldn't have a
problem DNA-ing this guy.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.750
Did someone recognise me from YouTube?

13:47.800 --> 13:48.910
I don't know.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.320
The Chief says he wants
it to be a surprise.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.910
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.960
I'm gonna walk in that
door and find out who I am.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.750
I'm the Chief Constable.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.910
Which...? Which one is it?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.590
Who-Who's come for me?

14:08.640 --> 14:09.910
- I have.
- What?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.110
You're under arrest for armed robbery,

14:12.160 --> 14:14.590
- contrary to the Theft
Act of 1968. - No!

14:14.640 --> 14:15.910
- No, I...
- You're also under arrest

14:15.960 --> 14:19.060
for the murder of Eric John Ross.
You don't have to say anything.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.960
- He's the Boston Bandit?
- Him?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.160
Oh, shit!

14:38.960 --> 14:40.410
Incredible work, sir.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.910
How did you know? The Boston Bandit?

14:43.960 --> 14:46.910
Did a victim ID him off Facebook Live?

14:46.960 --> 14:47.910
No.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.110
So, what have we got, sir, like, evidence?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.910
Not a goddamn thing.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.910
But you're sure it was him?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
100%.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.910
I just need you to go prove it.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.960
Start with his DNA. Go from there.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.960
Do you recognise him?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.910
It seems you didn't want him
to recognise you, either.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.910
You reversed over him.

15:21.960 --> 15:22.960
A right mess.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.110
I suppose your blood was up.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.910
You'd just robbed the
Claxby Pluckacre Royal Mail

15:28.960 --> 15:29.910
customer service point.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.960
Robbed a post office?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.910
You shot the postmaster, too.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.960
Sign this.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.750
Only 10% of the population
can use their left.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.160
The Bandit could use both, like you.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.430
Get off me!

15:48.480 --> 15:49.960
I did this, didn't I?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.910
I need to hear all about it.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
I need to know what I am.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.910
'The armed robber targeted
remote businesses, like Mr Chana.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.910
'He entered masked, shot
out the security cameras,

16:09.960 --> 16:11.910
'took the money from the safe

16:11.960 --> 16:14.910
'and left the staff
menaced and terrorised.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.950
'The robbery at Claxby was a
particularly nasty attack,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.910
'as the robber discharged his
weapon directly at Mr Chana,

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
'leaving him with a life-altering injury.'

16:29.960 --> 16:31.750
This is a direct result

16:31.800 --> 16:35.910
of us prioritising
serious unsolved crimes.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.910
Red cases, as we call them.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.960
I am today announcing phase three.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.750
Going forward, anyone arrested by my force

16:45.800 --> 16:49.910
will have their DNA taken,
collected and sampled

16:49.960 --> 16:52.910
against any outstanding crimes that
are keeping our citizens awake.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.960
Chief Constable, you're not worried
about an invasion of privacy?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.750
Let me think about that for a minute.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.910
No.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.800
- Too right, Chief Constable.
- Thank you very much.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.910
The Boston Bandit is
quite a coup, Mr Hixon.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.910
So what's he like, then, the Piano Man?

17:09.960 --> 17:13.270
That is an awfully cute
way to describe a guy

17:13.319 --> 17:14.910
who shot up five post offices,

17:14.960 --> 17:17.910
stole a combined total of £300,000,

17:17.960 --> 17:20.910
murdered an innocent man
by crushing him to death

17:20.960 --> 17:22.260
with the wheels of his car.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.260
He shot off that man's leg.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.270
See?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.960
It's personal for officers.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.590
You did really well, Dad.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.750
A nice plug for the minimart, too.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.110
He's your dad?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.910
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't anyone tell me?

17:39.960 --> 17:42.910
My father's a proud man. He never
wanted any special treatment.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.910
And you were OK with this case
just sitting in a file unsolved?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.910
What, you think we
didn't try to catch him?

17:47.960 --> 17:50.910
That man came into my home
and almost killed my dad.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.960
Well, you should have told me.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.910
This place...

17:55.960 --> 17:58.910
It's so small, it's like
fucking Fraggle Rock.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.000
What am I doing here?

18:03.320 --> 18:04.910
Making a difference.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.960
Presumably, for the first time ever.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.960
Thank you.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.960
I must say, I was surprised you called.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.910
Well, you are the Crown Court
judge. I'm the Chief Constable.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
I thought we might work together.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.270
Oh... Fine.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.910
Well, if that's what this is,

18:32.960 --> 18:34.910
I suggest you call and make
an appointment with my clerk.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.910
I don't work after five, Mr Hixon.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.910
- I thought this was a date.
- Well...

18:38.960 --> 18:41.480
Well, hang on. This could have been.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.910
Hello?

18:54.960 --> 18:57.960
'I didn't have you down
as a crooked cop, Muriel.'

18:59.160 --> 19:01.590
What are you talking about, Krasnov?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.910
You really didn't know?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.960
A smart girl like you.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.590
How was your American so
sure that man is the Bandit?

19:09.640 --> 19:12.910
- I mean, he must have had...
- Evidence?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.910
DNA perhaps.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.960
Where would he have got
a sample of his DNA?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.960
So, that's how he did it.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.960
It's inadmissible, right?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.910
I mean, cross-contamination,
no probable cause.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.910
That's where you came in.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.000
He needed a result and you got him one.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.910
I didn't expect that.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.910
But it's been a while.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.910
Well, what you lack in finesse,
you make up for with enthusiasm.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.590
That's not what I meant.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.910
I meant, it's been a while since
I've been on a proper date.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.910
I thought you said this wasn't a date.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.460
I only agreed to come cos I thought
it was a professional get-together.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.960
You're going to be far too easy to tease.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.430
So...

20:38.480 --> 20:39.910
- What's he like, then?
- Who?

20:39.960 --> 20:41.640
The Piano Man.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.910
- What do I care?
- Because it's important.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.910
How does a man get from there
to here or here to there?

20:47.960 --> 20:49.750
I don't care about him.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.910
I just care that he's a notorious red case

20:51.960 --> 20:53.460
we get to wipe off of our board.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.910
Well, I'd want to know.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.910
And I will want to know.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.960
Boston Bandit or Piano Man...

21:01.960 --> 21:03.910
.. who is he?

21:03.960 --> 21:04.910
You'd better find out.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.910
See you in court.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.910
He's not in here!

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
PC Drakes!

21:46.960 --> 21:47.960
Sir?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.960
Get an ambulance!

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
Now!

22:05.160 --> 22:07.160
Well, you seem OK.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.110
Next time you decide to kill yourself,

22:10.160 --> 22:12.110
do it on somebody else's time...

22:12.160 --> 22:14.110
Piano Man, or whatever the
hell your name really is.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.360
Si.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.110
- What?
- My name...

22:19.160 --> 22:21.110
is Si,

22:21.160 --> 22:23.160
or at least I think it is.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.110
Si?

22:25.160 --> 22:27.160
As in Simon?

22:29.160 --> 22:31.160
As in psycho?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.110
What else do you remember?

22:36.160 --> 22:39.110
You had the dead guy's picture in
your hand. What was that, a trophy?

22:39.160 --> 22:42.160
Was that guilt? Is that why
you tried to kill yourself?

22:43.160 --> 22:46.110
Do you know what it's
like to find a suicide?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.160
Cos I do.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.160
I'm sorry.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.310
I didn't think.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.160
I just wanted out.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.680
I think I know him.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.110
Who, the victim?

23:04.160 --> 23:05.160
Eric Ross?

23:06.160 --> 23:08.160
At least, my soul does.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.950
- You mean your conscience.
- Maybe.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.110
Is that what you think?

23:13.160 --> 23:16.160
What the hell do I have
to do with any of this?

23:17.160 --> 23:18.160
Well, you saved me.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.160
I thought you'd help
me figure out who I am.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.110
The same MO every time. Brilliant.
The simpler the better for a jury.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.110
The Bandit's as good with
his right as his left,

23:35.160 --> 23:37.110
just like Piano Man.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.110
We've got him on camera. Brilliant.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.110
We've got his DNA and blood
from a Nissan. Brilliant.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.110
- He must have cut himself
in the crash. - Brilliant.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.950
Robbery, road rage, murder.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.150
All set, then, Chief.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.110
- Chief?
- Brilliant.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.150
Brilliant is what you are,
sir. This is all down to you.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.950
See you all at the bail hearing.
It'll be very short and very sweet.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.160
Brilliant.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.160
Are you all right, sir?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.790
The Bandit pulverised Eric Ross.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.150
He blew off Barry's leg.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.110
Yeah. He panicked at Claxby, they reckon.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.110
Does the Bandit seem like
a panicky type to you?

24:10.160 --> 24:13.150
Well, maybe he is just
a mad psycho bastard.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.110
I mean, he did try throttling that kid.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.160
Yeah, but he's not a mad psycho bastard.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.160
Look at him.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.610
I-I don't think he's our guy.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.110
But we've got a DNA match, sir.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.110
I know. As good as with
his left as his right.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.160
Do you really buy that?

24:38.160 --> 24:39.160
Hey, nice shot, Sean.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.110
Ah, noisy German things.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.110
I fucking hate guns.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.110
I wanted to pick your
brain about the Bandit.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.110
I mean, so what if he changed his hands?

24:49.160 --> 24:52.110
Everything else is exactly
the same every time.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.110
Well, no.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.790
I mean, no-one's gonna
change their shooting hand.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.110
It's not like some rap video.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.160
You can only aim true with one side.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.110
- Your dominant side.
- His is sawn-off.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.150
He doesn't need to aim. Point and shoot.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.160
Oh, I'd like to see you
try that, cack-eye.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.110
What, taking those cameras
out first time, every time?

25:13.160 --> 25:16.110
I don't see you shooting
bull's-eyes any more.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.110
Here...

25:18.160 --> 25:21.110
I damaged my optical nerve
representing the force.

25:21.160 --> 25:25.110
Oh, yeah, playing rugby sevens
against West Lincs Constab.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.110
Oh, piss off.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.560
I don't know why you're wasting your
time with PC Pillock here, Muriel.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.110
You and Jack Sparrow over there

25:32.160 --> 25:35.110
can convince yourselves all you like,

25:35.160 --> 25:37.110
but summat's skewiff.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.110
And if you can't explain that,

25:39.160 --> 25:41.360
any decent brief will
fill you full of holes.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.110
Here you go.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.630
The Bandit's greatest hits.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.110
As good with his left
as he is with his right.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.110
Yeah, well, that's what we thought.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.160
We were wrong.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.160
Look, if we put them in
chronological order...

26:01.160 --> 26:06.160
Look, everything before and
including Claxby, he's left-handed.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.150
Everything after is right.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.110
Something happened at Claxby.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.110
'Of course something happened.'

26:13.160 --> 26:15.110
He shot my leg off!

26:15.160 --> 26:16.110
Urgh!

26:16.160 --> 26:18.110
Bastard eBay.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.470
It'll be the death of me.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.110
But why did he shoot you, Barry?

26:21.160 --> 26:22.310
I mean, he didn't shoot any of the others.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.110
He panicked, didn't he?

26:24.160 --> 26:26.840
Well, he never did before.
He never did after.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.110
So, why do you think, genius?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.110
It was always the same.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.110
Five post offices, in and out.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.110
Apart from this one
day. Something changed.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.110
He shot you. He crashed
into Eric what's-his-name.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.150
Maybe something happened to his
arm during the crash, but...

26:45.200 --> 26:47.160
Why did he crash?

26:48.160 --> 26:50.110
I mean, the Bandit's ice, ice, baby.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.110
And then, one day, a bloodbath,
blasting your leg off,

26:53.160 --> 26:55.110
grinding Eric Ross into mincemeat.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Get out of my shop.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.160
I'm calling my daughter.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.110
- I said get out!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.110
- Mr Chana, I didn't mean to...
- Out!

27:04.160 --> 27:06.150
Right, I'm going. I'm going.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.110
I'm sorry.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.160
Lydia, it's Dad.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.110
Yeah, it's, er, it's Muriel.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.160
She's here in the shop asking questions.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.110
Mr Chana had a gun for protection.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.110
He shot at the Bandit.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.110
- Jesus, Dad.
- You shot at him?

27:31.160 --> 27:32.110
Good for you.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.790
Not so good, sir. It's illegal.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.110
Self-defence.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.150
- And he was halfway out the door.
- Shut up, Dad.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.110
Any weapon that's carried for self-defence

27:40.160 --> 27:41.470
is an offensive weapon by law.

27:41.520 --> 27:45.160
I presume Mr Chana knew that,
that's why he didn't report it.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.110
It's not like I killed him.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.110
Are you sure?

27:50.160 --> 27:52.110
Yes! I saw blood.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.470
Maybe that's why he crashed.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.110
He was wounded.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.110
The doctor's checked him.
No bullet wounds on Si.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
Shit!

28:01.160 --> 28:03.110
What now, sir?

28:03.160 --> 28:06.110
The Crown believes we have a
very strong chance of conviction.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.150
We have the suspect on CCTV.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.110
DNA evidence links him to
the getaway car, the robbery

28:10.160 --> 28:12.110
and to the murder of Eric Ross.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.160
And he's not exactly pleading innocence.

28:14.680 --> 28:18.110
Are you ready to enter a plea, Mr Si?

28:18.160 --> 28:19.200
How-How can I?

28:20.840 --> 28:22.110
I don't remember.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.470
If you don't remember,
you can't plead guilty.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.950
I'm recording a plea of not guilty.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.790
Hearing date to be set
for three weeks' time

28:28.840 --> 28:30.310
to allow for psychological evaluation.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.110
How do the police feel
about bail, DS Blair?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.110
Or need I ask?

28:35.160 --> 28:37.110
East Lincolnshire Constabulary
has grave concerns...

28:37.160 --> 28:40.160
East Lincolnshire Constabulary
has no objection to bail.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.110
You what?

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
No fear of flight or further offences.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
I see.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.470
I'm releasing you on bail on
condition of residence, Mr Si.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.160
Make sure we know where to find you.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.160
The council has found you a room.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.160
You can stay here until the hearing.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
Why are you doing this for me?

29:25.160 --> 29:27.520
You're under curfew from 6pm to 9am.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.260
I figured you could use some company.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.160
Not that.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.160
My wife used to play that.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.160
You know how I don't know who I am?

29:52.160 --> 29:54.110
Wouldn't it be funny if I was your wife?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.160
Oh, yeah, hilarious.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.160
But you're not.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.160
She's dead.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.160
Accident.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.160
I was wondering what that was.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.200
That emptiness.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.160
You've lost a lot, haven't you?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.160
Do you think I have a wife somewhere?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.160
No-one's claimed me.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.160
Si, I think it's better not to know.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.160
No past, nothing to lose.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.160
Come in.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.110
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.160
- Oh, you look like shit.
- Thank you.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.110
Well, actually, you don't.
You look like a Gillette ad.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.110
You know, when he goes in the
bathroom all sleepy and gorgeous

30:57.160 --> 30:58.110
to shave?

30:58.160 --> 31:01.110
Young Yeardsley, the
temptation in an investigation

31:01.160 --> 31:03.110
is to focus on the perpetrator.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.110
I have flipped my analytics to the victim.

31:06.160 --> 31:10.110
25 variables, including
the quarterly accounts

31:10.160 --> 31:11.310
of every post office.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.110
Christ, you have been here all night!

31:14.160 --> 31:16.110
Each post office bought
the same security camera

31:16.160 --> 31:18.110
in the three-month
lead-up to the robberies.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.160
The Logitech 5000.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.470
Network ready, pin sharp at 50
metres, all from Tech Lincs.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.110
On the ring road?

31:27.160 --> 31:29.110
So, what, he hacked the cameras?

31:29.160 --> 31:30.790
Is that how he got the safe combos?

31:30.840 --> 31:33.160
I don't know. I'm not a
detective, DC Yeardsley.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.150
- Are we going somewhere?
- I am.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.110
I'm going home to get some sleep.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.160
And you are going to Tech Lincs
on Lord Of The Rings Road.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.150
You're too late, DC Yeardsley.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.110
Eight weeks too late.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.110
Tech Lincs closed down after Black Friday.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.110
Shit.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.470
What happened to this town, hey?

31:53.520 --> 31:55.160
Amazon happened.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.110
I'll, erm...

31:58.160 --> 32:02.110
put a 375 on to HMRC and try to
get some names off the payroll.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.110
Hey...

32:04.160 --> 32:06.110
What have you got yourself
messed up in, Muriel?

32:06.160 --> 32:08.160
You and Oleg Krasnov.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.160
You were seen.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.520
He came to my house.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.110
He owns my farm. My mum
and dad, they don't...

32:17.160 --> 32:19.110
This is what he does.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.310
He takes good cops and he makes them his.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.160
You should have come to me.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.160
So what do I do?

32:27.160 --> 32:28.110
Do your job.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.110
Follow the evidence.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
Ask Si about Tech Lincs.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.110
You know as well as me what catches crims.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.110
One good cop goes back again and again

32:38.160 --> 32:41.160
until she finds what this
bastard's trying so hard to hide.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.160
He hasn't set foot outside
since he's been here.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.950
He doesn't even open the
door to the cleaners.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.900
Right, thank you, I'll take it from here.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.150
Si?

33:03.160 --> 33:05.160
Are you all right, Si?

33:07.160 --> 33:09.470
Are you feeling a bit under the weather?

33:09.520 --> 33:11.160
Leave me alone.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.110
It's the voices in my head, they...

33:17.160 --> 33:19.110
they won't leave me alone.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.110
What, in the other flats?
Shall I have a word?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.110
It's you lot.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.110
You and...

33:25.160 --> 33:27.630
Just leave me alone.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.110
What do you mean, us lot?

33:29.160 --> 33:31.520
Have other cops been round to see you?

33:34.160 --> 33:36.160
Why don't I have a tidy-up?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.110
Shit!

33:45.680 --> 33:47.110
It's all right. One sec.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.310
Hello?

33:48.360 --> 33:51.110
HMRC responded to your
e-mail re Tech Lincs.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.110
They have a product
specialist named Simon Symon.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.110
'You stay away from him until
we know what's going on.'

33:56.160 --> 33:57.110
Yeah.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.150
Stay away from him. Don't
go anywhere near him.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.110
Yeah, Chief.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.660
'They're e-mailing me a
picture to get a positive ID.'

34:05.160 --> 34:07.110
Good. Erm...

34:07.160 --> 34:08.360
Listen, can I give you...?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.110
Officer requires assistance!

34:10.159 --> 34:12.110
Hello?

34:12.159 --> 34:13.159
Hello?!

34:17.000 --> 34:18.610
- I'll kill her!
- Put the gun down.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.610
Just like I killed Eric Ross!

34:20.659 --> 34:22.179
Put the gun down now.

34:24.659 --> 34:26.610
- Do you have a clean shot, Cobley?
- Uh-huh.

34:26.659 --> 34:28.610
If you want me to stop it,
you'll have to shoot me,

34:28.659 --> 34:30.610
and I'll take you all out.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.610
- Take him out.
- No, this is England.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.610
We don't shoot people, even if we have to.

34:34.659 --> 34:37.290
That's an order from
your superior officer.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.659
- Shoot him.
- Will I bollocks!

34:42.500 --> 34:43.659
I'll kill her!

34:44.659 --> 34:46.610
I'll kill her.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.290
I will. I'll kill all of you bastards.

34:48.340 --> 34:50.610
Cos that's what I am,
aren't I? I'm a killer.

34:50.659 --> 34:51.610
Shoot me!

34:51.659 --> 34:54.610
- You, get that bastard to shoot me!
- Oh, believe me, I tried.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.020
Nobody shoots anybody
here cos it's England.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.610
Cobley...

34:59.660 --> 35:02.660
- Putting the gun down, Si.
- No, no, don't!

35:03.660 --> 35:05.610
Right? It's all right.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.610
I did it.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.450
I remember now.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.610
I left Eric there in the road

35:10.660 --> 35:13.660
and there was bits everywhere
and I ran into the field.

35:14.660 --> 35:17.610
Are you listening to me?!

35:17.660 --> 35:19.610
I killed him!

35:19.660 --> 35:20.610
And I'm likely to do it again.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.610
Put it down, you bastard!

35:23.160 --> 35:24.610
Right, in!

35:24.660 --> 35:26.660
Go for it! Go for him!

35:28.660 --> 35:31.660
- It wasn't even loaded?
- No, I didn't want to get anyone hurt.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.610
Maybe DS Blair should
be our weapons officer.

35:35.660 --> 35:37.610
Oh, I was, sir. And damn good at it.

35:37.660 --> 35:41.290
I've done everything at this nick,
fraud squad to crime prevention.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.610
Dickhead.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.660
I assume we will be opposing
bail this time, Chief Constable?

35:46.660 --> 35:47.860
Are you all right, Cobley?

36:00.660 --> 36:03.130
'So, I take it you've
seen the papers, Dad?'

36:03.180 --> 36:04.660
Yeah.

36:05.660 --> 36:08.610
The English sure have a
lot of words for failure.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
Kind of like the Eskimos for snow.

36:11.660 --> 36:12.610
Anyway...

36:12.660 --> 36:14.610
I've got to go.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.610
I'm right in the middle of a meeting.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.610
'You trusted your gut.

36:17.660 --> 36:19.340
'I still love you. Bye.'

36:30.660 --> 36:32.660
What are you doing here, sir?

36:33.660 --> 36:34.610
Hiding.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.340
Trying to.

36:38.660 --> 36:42.610
And wondering how much this
godforsaken storage facility

36:42.660 --> 36:45.290
is costing me. What about you, Detective?

36:45.340 --> 36:48.660
I'm just checking over the trial
evidence, sir, for the CPS file.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.970
- This is the murder weapon.
- It's the grey Nissan, sir.

36:53.020 --> 36:55.660
And the red one Eric Ross was driving.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.660
Me and my fucking gut.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.660
Right, sir.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.610
Or maybe Si is trying to remember.

37:09.660 --> 37:10.610
Remember what, sir?

37:10.660 --> 37:14.020
That's what you need to find out.
That's what we need to unlock.

37:22.660 --> 37:25.960
The crime prevention officer
recommended the cameras, seriously?

37:26.660 --> 37:28.660
Did anyone else visit Si here?

38:05.860 --> 38:07.700
Is this how you remember it, Si?

38:10.660 --> 38:11.860
Anything before this?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.610
So, this is how you do it Stateside, sir?

38:23.660 --> 38:25.610
Yeah. It's pretty common.

38:25.660 --> 38:28.610
In a complex case like this,
we film a re-enactment,

38:28.660 --> 38:30.610
it gives the jury something
they can understand.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.610
Sir, Si's going to take a breather.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.660
I got this, DC Yeardsley. Thank you.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.660
It must be hard for you being back here.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.660
It's all back to front, somehow.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.970
You robbed the post office.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.610
You shot Mr Chana. You drove down here.

38:50.660 --> 38:51.610
No.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.610
You reversed over Mr
Ross, who's lying there.

38:54.660 --> 38:57.610
Sorry, sir, but this road
closure's taking a lot of manpower.

38:57.660 --> 38:59.660
Maybe we should get Si back.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.610
Si...

39:02.660 --> 39:04.970
It's a funny name, isn't it?

39:05.020 --> 39:08.610
Not really, sir. Not when
your name's Simon Symons.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.660
Except it isn't.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.660
This is from Simon Symons' HR file.

39:17.660 --> 39:19.650
You're kidding, right? It's a black fella.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.660
So who's he?

39:23.660 --> 39:25.610
308si.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.610
Si.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.450
He's been playing us.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.610
He got the name from the car.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.970
So, my name's not Si?

39:33.020 --> 39:34.610
Cut the crap, son.

39:34.660 --> 39:37.130
- Tell us what you did!
- We know what he did.

39:37.180 --> 39:38.610
He blew off Barry's leg. Bang!

39:40.020 --> 39:42.810
And he drove down here and
crashed into the Peugeot. Bang!

39:42.860 --> 39:46.650
He murdered an innocent man,
took $30,000 and a shotgun.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.700
Bang! Bang! Bang!

39:51.180 --> 39:53.660
Except the trauma's
protecting his memory of it.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.610
Seriously, sir?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.610
He mowed a man down!

39:58.660 --> 40:01.610
I mean, I can see how that was
traumatic for Mr Ross, but...

40:01.660 --> 40:02.660
Eric.

40:04.660 --> 40:06.660
His name was Eric.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.660
We met at the beach.

40:13.660 --> 40:15.660
He was beautiful.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.660
He kissed me.

40:22.660 --> 40:23.700
I got into his car.

40:25.660 --> 40:26.960
We were driving for hours.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.500
Happy.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.260
He was heading straight for us.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.110
So Eric swerved.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.660
And I was sitting... here.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.260
My head...

40:45.020 --> 40:48.610
So you were sitting in the
passenger seat of this car,

40:48.660 --> 40:50.260
not driving the murder vehicle?

40:52.020 --> 40:53.610
No.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.610
So I didn't do it.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.610
You're fucking kidding me.

40:56.660 --> 40:58.610
Right, let's get this
carnival off the road.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.660
Hang on!

41:01.660 --> 41:04.660
If you were sitting here,
could you have seen the killer?

41:22.660 --> 41:24.610
He would have had to
have cleaned this car up

41:24.660 --> 41:26.660
and dragged you over to the driver's seat.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.660
Your eye.

41:46.660 --> 41:47.970
It was bleeding.

41:48.020 --> 41:49.610
Me?

41:49.660 --> 41:50.650
Seriously?

41:50.700 --> 41:52.610
You're joking!

41:52.660 --> 41:53.610
Is he?

41:53.660 --> 41:56.610
That was our mistake. The
Bandit's eye got injured.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.610
And that's why he changed hands.

41:58.660 --> 42:00.610
Nobody loses an eye from playing rugby.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.660
That's just the NFL for fat guys.

42:03.660 --> 42:04.610
But a pellet gun...

42:04.660 --> 42:07.340
That would seriously
damage an optical nerve.

42:08.180 --> 42:11.610
Barry Chana said you were his
crime prevention officer.

42:11.660 --> 42:13.610
Recommended the Logitech 5000.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.610
He said you even showed him
where to point the camera,

42:15.660 --> 42:18.610
- right at the safe.
- For fuck's sake, Muriel!

42:18.660 --> 42:20.650
He had the actual shotgun in his bedsit.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.610
Yeah, I had a chat with the caretaker.

42:23.660 --> 42:24.610
He said you used his keys.

42:24.660 --> 42:27.260
You put the shotgun in the
room. It was your shotgun.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.610
What do you think, cack-eye?

42:31.660 --> 42:33.610
Huh?

42:33.660 --> 42:35.660
Do you think it's loaded this time, hey?

42:40.700 --> 42:43.660
What was there to look
forward to? A poxy pension.

42:45.180 --> 42:47.340
All I ever wanted, my whole life...

42:48.660 --> 42:49.860
.. was to be a copper.

42:51.660 --> 42:54.660
But nobody ever tells you
that being a copper is shit.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.610
You have the right to...

42:58.660 --> 43:00.610
What is it, Muriel?

43:00.660 --> 43:02.660
Shut the fuck up.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.610
I'll be out in six months.

43:14.660 --> 43:15.970
Oleg will look after me.

43:16.020 --> 43:17.810
What about you, Muriel?

43:17.860 --> 43:20.660
Who's going to look after your sorry arse?

44:26.660 --> 44:27.610
Herbert?

44:27.660 --> 44:29.610
I didn't have you down as a Herbert.

44:29.660 --> 44:30.610
I know.

44:30.660 --> 44:32.660
Herbert de Young.

44:33.660 --> 44:36.610
I think I prefer Simon
Symons, Boston Bandit.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.660
Are you gonna tell her?

44:39.660 --> 44:41.610
My wife?

44:41.660 --> 44:43.810
That I went on a sales trip,
went for a walk on the beach,

44:43.860 --> 44:45.660
met a man and fell in love?

44:46.660 --> 44:49.130
You said he was in your soul.

44:49.180 --> 44:51.610
Have you never fell in
love with a man before?

44:51.660 --> 44:54.610
I don't think I've
fallen for anyone before.

44:54.660 --> 44:55.660
Can I tell her that?

44:56.660 --> 44:59.970
It's funny, I thought something
terrible had happened to me here.

45:00.020 --> 45:02.660
It turns out it was something amazing.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.650
You thought you were a
psychotic English pianist.

45:05.700 --> 45:07.610
It turns out you're a
married man who's gay.

45:07.660 --> 45:10.970
Herbert de Young, your
life begins here right now.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.820
You can be whatever you wanna
be, do whatever you wanna do.

45:14.660 --> 45:16.610
You really believe that?

45:16.660 --> 45:19.020
You can be whoever you wanna be?

45:20.660 --> 45:22.660
Good luck with that, Captain America.
