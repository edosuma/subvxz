00:02.147 --> 00:03.205
What are lawyers really?

00:04.717 --> 00:06.082
To me, a lawyer is basically...

00:06.285 --> 00:09.083
...the person that knows
the rules of the country.

00:09.255 --> 00:11.519
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...

00:11.724 --> 00:14.659
...moving our pieces around the
board, but if there's a problem...

00:14.860 --> 00:18.694
...the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.

00:19.965 --> 00:22.957
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."

00:23.135 --> 00:27.538
"Objection! Objection, Your Honor."

00:28.107 --> 00:31.941
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."

00:36.615 --> 00:39.550
To which the judge
can say two things:

00:39.718 --> 00:44.348
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."

00:45.190 --> 00:49.126
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."

00:55.167 --> 00:57.499
So... So you're a lawyer.

00:58.137 --> 00:59.627
What kind of cases
do you handle?

00:59.805 --> 01:03.764
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.

01:04.143 --> 01:07.579
What is that? lmmigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?

01:10.049 --> 01:11.744
Are your friends as funny as you?

01:12.518 --> 01:15.578
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.

01:15.754 --> 01:18.780
I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.759
Look, I was nice enough
to pick it up for you.

01:21.927 --> 01:24.122
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.

01:24.296 --> 01:26.787
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.

01:26.966 --> 01:28.866
Elaine, that's what mail is.

01:29.034 --> 01:31.867
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.

01:32.504 --> 01:34.802
- Here's my card.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

01:34.974 --> 01:37.340
- Hey, good talking to you.
- Nice meeting you.

01:40.446 --> 01:41.913
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

01:42.081 --> 01:44.015
You would not believe
what just happened.

01:44.183 --> 01:47.277
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.

01:47.453 --> 01:49.011
- What, the one who just left?
- Yeah.

01:49.188 --> 01:50.485
And so we started talking...

01:50.656 --> 01:52.590
...and she's this lawyer,
who's incredible.

01:52.758 --> 01:54.419
You know,
everything I said was funny.

01:54.593 --> 01:57.926
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.657
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.

02:00.833 --> 02:04.325
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.

02:04.803 --> 02:06.430
I got no place to go.

02:07.339 --> 02:10.068
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.

02:10.609 --> 02:12.634
Hey, is that Babu?

02:13.045 --> 02:16.981
- It is. Hey, Babu!
- Jerry.

02:17.149 --> 02:18.912
Look at you. You got the job.

02:19.084 --> 02:21.985
- Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

02:22.154 --> 02:25.385
No, you do everything. Get me job,
get me place to live in your building.

02:25.557 --> 02:26.922
- Come on.
- You very good man.

02:27.092 --> 02:28.559
- Stop.
- You did everything for me.

02:28.727 --> 02:31.025
I can never thank you enough
for everything you do.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.323
You see, this is what I do
with women.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.467
I start out too strong.

02:35.634 --> 02:38.432
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.

02:39.304 --> 02:42.205
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.

02:42.374 --> 02:44.968
- No, they don't. No.
- Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.

02:45.144 --> 02:48.238
Oh, you gotta put on a show. You
always gotta give them a big show.

02:48.414 --> 02:51.281
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?

02:51.450 --> 02:54.715
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.

02:56.722 --> 02:58.189
You mean that's true? I'm right?

02:58.357 --> 03:00.825
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out, Babu.

03:00.993 --> 03:04.019
- Yes. Everything wonderful.
- I'll see you around the building.

03:04.196 --> 03:06.391
I'll see you in the building.

03:06.899 --> 03:09.265
- Remember Babu Bhatt?
- Who's he?

03:09.668 --> 03:12.330
Remember that guy, opened
the restaurant across the street...

03:12.504 --> 03:15.098
...from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?

03:15.307 --> 03:17.502
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.

03:17.676 --> 03:19.610
- It drove him right out of business.
- Right.

03:20.379 --> 03:22.540
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?

03:22.715 --> 03:24.945
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you bring my mail then please?

03:25.117 --> 03:27.176
- What mail?
- I picked up his mail...

03:27.352 --> 03:30.014
...while he was on the road.
- Why didn't Kramer pick it up?

03:30.189 --> 03:32.783
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.

03:32.958 --> 03:35.586
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?

03:35.761 --> 03:39.561
- Monday, I think.
- Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.

03:39.732 --> 03:42.360
His whole life is a fantasy camp.

03:42.534 --> 03:46.561
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.

03:46.772 --> 03:49.297
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...

03:49.475 --> 03:52.239
...mooch food off your neighbors
and have sex without dating.

03:52.411 --> 03:54.038
That's a fantasy camp.

03:55.247 --> 03:58.273
Listen, if you're gonna go out
with this lawyer, have dinner with us...

03:58.450 --> 04:01.248
...then maybe you can go
to the auto show with her if you want.

04:01.420 --> 04:03.854
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.

04:06.658 --> 04:09.126
He never heard of corduroy!

04:09.294 --> 04:11.421
Stop it, you're killing me!

04:12.297 --> 04:18.202
Never heard of corduroy.
True story. True story.

04:19.303 --> 04:20.737
Funny.

04:23.842 --> 04:27.539
- No. No, I don't... I don't think so.
- Why?

04:27.713 --> 04:30.705
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.

04:30.983 --> 04:34.384
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.

04:36.054 --> 04:37.385
She might not be comfortable.

04:37.556 --> 04:39.751
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.

04:39.925 --> 04:41.916
- We'll be funny.
- No. No.

04:42.094 --> 04:44.221
It's not good. I don't think so.

04:44.530 --> 04:48.296
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.799
No. No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.

04:50.969 --> 04:53.904
- Why?
- No, it's too trendy. No Isabella's.

05:00.412 --> 05:01.936
Excellent.

05:02.447 --> 05:04.813
Like I really know
what I'm talking about.

05:07.085 --> 05:09.576
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.

05:09.755 --> 05:11.416
But toast I love.

05:11.790 --> 05:14.657
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.

05:15.260 --> 05:18.229
In fact, let's toast to toast.

05:24.436 --> 05:27.371
Look who's here. Georgie boy.

05:27.873 --> 05:30.842
What are you doing here? I thought
you said you hated Isabella's.

05:31.009 --> 05:32.374
No, I talked him into it.

05:32.544 --> 05:34.034
What happened to the auto show?

05:34.213 --> 05:37.376
Oh, we're still going. Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.943
The turbo quadramatic transmission...

05:40.118 --> 05:42.450
...offers you the power and prestige
to propel you...

05:42.621 --> 05:44.612
...well into the 21 st century.

05:51.730 --> 05:52.924
Hi.

05:53.398 --> 05:56.128
- Hi.
- Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.

05:56.301 --> 05:57.563
Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:57.736 --> 06:00.864
- Would you like to join us?
- No, no. They don't wanna join us.

06:01.039 --> 06:02.802
- No, it's okay. Don't be silly.
- Okay.

06:02.975 --> 06:04.670
Why don't we put
these tables together.

06:04.843 --> 06:08.677
You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...

06:11.750 --> 06:14.810
Jerry. Jerry, tell them that
funny story you were telling me...

06:14.987 --> 06:16.955
No. No.

06:17.122 --> 06:21.149
No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?

06:21.326 --> 06:22.918
You know, we should really order.

06:23.095 --> 06:26.292
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...

06:26.698 --> 06:29.531
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?

06:29.935 --> 06:31.903
- I'm being sued.
- Oh, what happened?

06:32.871 --> 06:37.535
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...

06:38.744 --> 06:41.212
...and I knocked over
the delivery boy.

06:42.214 --> 06:44.648
Was he Chinese?

06:45.050 --> 06:46.176
Yeah.

06:46.351 --> 06:48.945
Is your...? Is your last name "Benes"?

06:49.121 --> 06:53.455
- How did you know?
- Oh, God! Ping is my cousin.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.149
No.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.985
- That's so funny.
- I'm handling his case.

06:58.163 --> 06:59.152
What?

06:59.331 --> 07:01.390
- You're Cheryl Fong?
- That's right.

07:01.566 --> 07:02.828
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

07:03.001 --> 07:05.993
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.

07:06.171 --> 07:07.331
I know.

07:07.906 --> 07:09.271
Wow. Well, l...

07:09.441 --> 07:12.842
I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.540
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.

07:21.153 --> 07:22.313
Tell Ping I said hello.

07:23.622 --> 07:26.921
Tell him you think you may have
broken the case wide open.

07:31.763 --> 07:33.560
I can't believe it.

07:33.732 --> 07:35.723
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

07:35.901 --> 07:38.335
- What?
- This is not good. This is not good.

07:38.503 --> 07:40.971
- What's the matter?
- I don't think it's a great idea...

07:41.139 --> 07:42.766
...for you to sit here.
- Why not?

07:42.941 --> 07:45.501
He thinks if you're too funny,
he might not look so funny.

07:45.677 --> 07:46.939
Biff.

07:47.679 --> 07:48.907
What?

07:49.081 --> 07:52.175
- You're not worried about that?
- No, of course not.

07:52.351 --> 07:54.581
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?

07:54.753 --> 07:57.745
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...

07:57.923 --> 08:01.381
...she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.

08:02.094 --> 08:03.220
Well, should we leave?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.863
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.

08:06.031 --> 08:08.226
Would it kill you
not to be so funny all the time?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.526
That's all I'm asking.

08:09.701 --> 08:11.168
This woman thinks I'm very funny.

08:11.336 --> 08:13.463
Now you're gonna be funny,
so, what am I gonna be?

08:13.638 --> 08:17.768
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

08:19.011 --> 08:22.947
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?

08:23.115 --> 08:25.777
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.

08:25.951 --> 08:27.111
- You don't?
- No way.

08:27.285 --> 08:28.946
It's completely under my control.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.788
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.755
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?

08:35.827 --> 08:37.226
A little.

08:37.395 --> 08:39.489
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

08:39.831 --> 08:41.092
Yeah.

08:41.265 --> 08:42.631
George, is this funny?

08:43.068 --> 08:44.592
It's funny.

08:46.538 --> 08:48.802
And it wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.

08:48.974 --> 08:50.464
What? What did I do?

08:50.642 --> 08:52.007
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:53.578 --> 08:54.943
Hello.

08:58.216 --> 08:59.808
Welcome back.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.681
I'm sorry. It was my aunt's birthday.

09:03.855 --> 09:05.413
She makes such a big deal about it.

09:05.757 --> 09:07.987
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

09:08.160 --> 09:12.062
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...

09:13.231 --> 09:15.062
...and how little we've grown.

09:16.034 --> 09:18.025
No matter how desperate we are
that someday...

09:18.203 --> 09:21.400
...a better self will emerge, each flicker
of the candles on the cake...

09:21.573 --> 09:22.938
...we know it's not to be.

09:23.842 --> 09:27.505
But for the rest of our sad,
wretched, pathetic lives...

09:28.947 --> 09:30.972
...this is who we are to the bitter end...

09:31.149 --> 09:33.913
...inevitably, irrevocably.

09:35.053 --> 09:38.420
Happy birthday? No such thing.

09:41.193 --> 09:43.320
Funny guy, huh?

09:47.532 --> 09:49.466
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.

09:49.634 --> 09:52.159
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.700
Oh, listen. So guess what.

09:55.006 --> 09:58.806
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.

09:58.977 --> 10:00.569
Drop the case?

10:00.745 --> 10:03.043
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.

10:03.215 --> 10:06.013
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.

10:06.284 --> 10:10.516
Oh, great. Birth announcement
from Arnie and Joy Harris.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.688
Hear that? Guess who's back.

10:18.930 --> 10:21.296
Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.

10:25.036 --> 10:27.903
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.005
Why?

10:31.176 --> 10:32.700
Well, there was an incident.

10:34.012 --> 10:35.240
What happened?

10:35.413 --> 10:38.541
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.

10:39.284 --> 10:40.751
- What?
- Yeah, I punched him...

10:40.919 --> 10:42.614
...and they took him
to the hospital...

10:42.787 --> 10:44.948
...and then they canceled
the rest of the week.

10:45.123 --> 10:46.715
You punched who in the mouth?

10:46.892 --> 10:48.450
Mickey Mantle.

10:49.528 --> 10:50.552
What happened?

10:50.729 --> 10:52.560
Well, you know,
we were playing a game...

10:52.731 --> 10:55.598
...and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.927
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...

10:58.103 --> 11:00.663
...and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.

11:00.839 --> 11:02.170
Wow, Joe Pepitone.

11:02.340 --> 11:05.138
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.

11:05.310 --> 11:08.302
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.347
A little chin music
right on his pants...

11:11.516 --> 11:14.417
...because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.578
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.

11:17.756 --> 11:20.520
So I had to plunk him.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.150
- You plunked him?
- Oh, yeah.

11:23.328 --> 11:26.855
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.

11:27.032 --> 11:29.262
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.

11:29.434 --> 11:32.232
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp, you know...

11:32.404 --> 11:33.735
...and the old Yankee players.

11:33.905 --> 11:36.806
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...

11:36.975 --> 11:38.704
...somebody pulls me from behind...

11:38.877 --> 11:41.641
...and I turned around
and I popped him.

11:41.813 --> 11:44.805
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.

11:46.718 --> 11:47.980
I punched his lights out.

11:48.486 --> 11:49.885
Wow, this is incredible.

11:50.255 --> 11:53.281
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.

11:53.491 --> 11:54.651
What's going on out there?

11:54.826 --> 11:55.850
What are you doing?

11:56.027 --> 11:59.929
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.

12:00.098 --> 12:02.293
Babu. I'll be right back.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.526
- Yeah, so...
- Hank Bauer, he's screaming:

12:04.703 --> 12:08.036
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"

12:09.641 --> 12:12.769
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I got the hell out of there.

12:13.878 --> 12:15.311
They took Babu away.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.038
They took Babu away?

12:17.215 --> 12:19.877
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.

12:20.051 --> 12:22.417
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.

12:22.587 --> 12:24.282
He had an apartment, he had a job.

12:24.456 --> 12:26.947
- What a shame.
- Jerry!

12:28.426 --> 12:30.223
Help me!

12:30.395 --> 12:35.924
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!

12:36.468 --> 12:38.834
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.

12:39.004 --> 12:41.996
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.

12:42.974 --> 12:44.305
What?

12:44.843 --> 12:47.573
- Well, this is interesting.
- What is it?

12:47.746 --> 12:50.044
It's a letter
from the lmmigration Bureau.

12:50.215 --> 12:54.151
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.

12:55.587 --> 12:57.714
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.

12:58.056 --> 13:00.524
Well, doesn't he need that?

13:02.000 --> 13:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:09.801 --> 13:12.998
If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.

13:13.171 --> 13:15.537
Well, you should have come
to my house to pick it up.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.005
- So am I being funny now?
- No, actually, you're not.

13:18.176 --> 13:20.770
See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.

13:21.179 --> 13:23.374
Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.

13:23.581 --> 13:27.483
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...

13:27.652 --> 13:29.779
...she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.

13:29.954 --> 13:31.512
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.419
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.

13:33.591 --> 13:34.922
There's a million lawyers.

13:35.093 --> 13:38.119
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.

13:38.296 --> 13:41.231
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.

13:41.399 --> 13:44.425
- Will you stop it already.
- Jerry, please.

13:44.602 --> 13:46.001
How long is this gonna go on?

13:46.905 --> 13:48.202
Till I'm comfortable.

13:48.373 --> 13:50.364
Well, when is that gonna be?

13:50.542 --> 13:52.407
After consummation.

13:53.078 --> 13:57.481
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.

14:02.020 --> 14:05.547
I have a friend in the immigration
department who owes me a big favor.

14:05.724 --> 14:07.282
You're very lucky.

14:11.996 --> 14:14.590
That's wonderful news. Thank you.

14:16.034 --> 14:18.229
You're a very serious person,
aren't you?

14:20.138 --> 14:24.165
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...

14:24.342 --> 14:28.142
...it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.

14:34.919 --> 14:36.546
I understand.

14:37.355 --> 14:38.583
I think that's curdled.

14:38.757 --> 14:40.691
I don't care.

14:43.661 --> 14:45.891
Do you ever laugh?

14:46.264 --> 14:50.325
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.

14:52.137 --> 14:54.469
That's so sad.

14:54.639 --> 14:55.731
What do you do?

14:55.907 --> 14:57.374
I'm a comedian.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.240
Oh, let me get that.

15:01.746 --> 15:03.543
You've been so helpful.

15:07.018 --> 15:09.486
Hey, we're gonna go
see Babu now, right?

15:09.654 --> 15:11.622
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.883
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.

15:14.058 --> 15:15.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:15.627 --> 15:18.095
Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much...

15:18.263 --> 15:20.424
...for convincing Ping
to drop the case.

15:20.598 --> 15:24.034
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.

15:24.202 --> 15:26.966
But between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.

15:29.674 --> 15:32.370
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

15:41.052 --> 15:44.215
- Babu.
- Jerry! Jerry. Hello, Jerry,

15:44.389 --> 15:47.381
- You remember Elaine.
- Yes, yes, of course.

15:48.059 --> 15:50.527
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice of you both to come.

15:50.695 --> 15:54.461
- Oh, Babu.
- No, you're both very kind. Very kind.

15:54.632 --> 15:57.260
- Oh, well, you know, we try.
- We do what we can.

15:57.435 --> 15:59.630
- We do what we can.
- See...

15:59.804 --> 16:02.637
...the problem is, I never got my
visa-renewal form in the mail.

16:02.807 --> 16:07.369
- I was expecting it.
- Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.

16:07.545 --> 16:08.944
What happened was...

16:09.113 --> 16:11.775
...I was away for a couple of weeks
doing some comedy shows.

16:11.950 --> 16:14.009
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.

16:14.819 --> 16:18.414
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...

16:18.590 --> 16:20.683
...because that little box
can get very full.

16:20.859 --> 16:23.123
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.

16:23.361 --> 16:24.828
I would have picked up your mail.

16:24.996 --> 16:27.692
- Your box is right next to mine.
- I don't want to bother you.

16:27.866 --> 16:31.358
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.

16:31.536 --> 16:34.130
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...

16:34.305 --> 16:36.830
...I looked in my mail,
and I noticed that the mailman...

16:37.008 --> 16:40.409
...accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.

16:40.578 --> 16:41.704
Come again?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.347
See, I've been home for a week...

16:43.515 --> 16:45.915
...and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...

16:46.084 --> 16:48.848
...even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.751
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.551
You had my visa application?

16:54.726 --> 16:56.284
- Well, not technically.
- I kill you!

16:56.661 --> 16:58.356
- What about her?
- I kill both of you!

16:58.530 --> 16:59.724
- Babu.
- No Babu.

16:59.898 --> 17:02.366
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.

17:02.534 --> 17:03.865
You're very lazy, bad man.

17:04.035 --> 17:05.662
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.

17:05.837 --> 17:08.670
I have a lawyer who knows someone
in the immigration department.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.775
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.376
Things are happening
as we speak.

17:13.545 --> 17:15.911
- The wheels are in motion?
- The wheels are in motion.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.273
Things are happening.

17:21.152 --> 17:22.414
Jerry?

17:22.587 --> 17:23.917
I'm very attracted to him.

17:24.188 --> 17:26.884
You think the person
you were talking to was him?

17:27.058 --> 17:31.552
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.

17:31.729 --> 17:34.823
- He's never said anything funny.
- He can't not be funny.

17:34.999 --> 17:40.062
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.

17:40.238 --> 17:42.900
Dark and disturbed?

17:43.074 --> 17:46.066
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.

17:46.711 --> 17:48.406
What kind of a friend are you?

17:48.580 --> 17:52.277
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.475
That's how disturbed I am.

17:54.652 --> 17:56.779
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.

17:56.955 --> 17:59.480
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.

17:59.657 --> 18:01.852
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?

18:02.026 --> 18:04.187
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.

18:04.362 --> 18:06.523
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.

18:06.698 --> 18:09.292
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?

18:09.467 --> 18:12.834
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.268
I'm the one that needs help.

18:17.275 --> 18:18.435
I gotta go.

18:18.910 --> 18:21.174
Well, should I call you later?

18:21.346 --> 18:22.438
Please don't.

18:22.614 --> 18:26.209
But... But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.

18:26.384 --> 18:30.320
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

18:33.625 --> 18:36.423
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?

18:36.594 --> 18:38.494
I don't know. I don't understand it.

18:38.663 --> 18:42.155
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.

18:43.301 --> 18:44.768
- Yeah?
- George.

18:44.936 --> 18:46.961
- Come on up.
- Babu.

18:47.438 --> 18:50.669
- Babu, what happened to you?
- Babu must be back.

18:50.842 --> 18:53.037
- Well, where's Babu?
- He is in Pakistan!

18:53.211 --> 18:55.270
- Who are you?
- I am his brother.

18:55.446 --> 18:57.880
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.040
I'm sure the lawyer
did everything they could.

19:00.218 --> 19:02.982
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?

19:03.154 --> 19:05.179
Show me Babu!

19:07.091 --> 19:08.956
- Snapple?
- No.

19:10.928 --> 19:12.657
Too fruity.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.365
Hey, what happened?

19:18.536 --> 19:20.731
I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.

19:20.905 --> 19:22.770
- She didn't help him?
- No.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.238
- Where is he?
- He's in Pakistan.

19:26.144 --> 19:27.168
Oh, boy

19:27.612 --> 19:29.204
What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?

19:29.380 --> 19:33.840
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.

19:34.018 --> 19:36.179
Not you, the disturbed you.

19:36.988 --> 19:38.717
So I had to tell her the truth.

19:38.890 --> 19:41.188
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!

19:41.359 --> 19:44.453
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.

19:44.629 --> 19:45.994
That's because she had my mail.

19:46.164 --> 19:49.600
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.

19:49.767 --> 19:52.531
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

19:52.704 --> 19:54.399
How could you go in there?

19:54.572 --> 19:57.302
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.

19:57.508 --> 19:59.908
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.

20:00.078 --> 20:02.103
It was eating me up inside!

20:02.680 --> 20:03.806
Well, what happened?

20:03.981 --> 20:06.745
I got down on my knees, and I went,
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.

20:06.918 --> 20:09.910
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.

20:10.088 --> 20:12.249
I love you, Mickey. I love you."

20:12.423 --> 20:13.720
So, what did he do?

20:13.891 --> 20:16.758
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...

20:16.928 --> 20:19.761
...and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.794
- Kramer.
- Hey!

20:23.968 --> 20:26.266
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.

20:26.437 --> 20:28.496
Oh, Ping. Hi.

20:28.673 --> 20:32.040
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.235
- Not anymore.
- What?

20:34.412 --> 20:37.279
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.

20:37.448 --> 20:38.779
Why?

20:38.950 --> 20:41.282
She call you
and your friends big liars.

20:41.452 --> 20:43.317
You think she nice girl?

20:43.488 --> 20:46.855
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!

20:47.024 --> 20:49.424
They call her "The Terminator."

20:49.594 --> 20:54.122
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.

20:54.298 --> 20:56.493
She doubled the damages.

20:56.667 --> 21:00.000
Hasta la vista, baby.

21:06.010 --> 21:09.275
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.

21:09.547 --> 21:10.946
And then he came to visit me...

21:11.115 --> 21:14.915
...said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.

21:15.086 --> 21:18.419
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.

21:18.589 --> 21:20.784
And so they sent me back here.

21:21.159 --> 21:23.389
This is a terrible story, Babu.

21:24.028 --> 21:25.495
What are you going to do?

21:25.663 --> 21:28.461
I'm going to save up every rupee...

21:28.633 --> 21:30.123
...for someday...

21:30.301 --> 21:33.737
...I will get back to America,
and when I do...

21:33.905 --> 21:36.635
...I will exact vengeance
on this man.

21:36.874 --> 21:38.569
I cannot forget him.

21:38.743 --> 21:40.608
He haunts me.

21:40.912 --> 21:47.408
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.

21:47.852 --> 21:49.285
I am for open immigration...

21:49.453 --> 21:51.819
...but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:

21:51.989 --> 21:55.186
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."

21:55.359 --> 21:58.851
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."

21:59.030 --> 22:02.761
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?

22:02.934 --> 22:04.265
I mean, why don't we just say:

22:04.435 --> 22:06.926
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...

22:07.138 --> 22:09.834
...people that can't drive,
that they have trouble merging...

22:10.007 --> 22:13.465
...if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...

22:13.644 --> 22:16.670
...if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...

22:16.848 --> 22:20.409
...if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...

22:20.585 --> 22:25.113
