00:15.583 --> 00:17.151
How is she?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.455
In and out of
the morphine drip.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.792
They got her stabilized
is all I know.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.328
Go on in.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.331
No.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.367
Unfreeze your ass
off that wall, then.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.868
Either pay
your respects

00:34.968 --> 00:36.737
or get your head
back into this case.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.940
Fuck this case.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.142
Fuck it, huh?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.310
Now you're just
gonna, what,

00:42.410 --> 00:43.777
call off your
little crusade?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.046
Is that what you
think it was?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.381
A crusade?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.049
Avon Barksdale was
just a way for me

00:49.150 --> 00:50.718
to show everyone
how smart I was,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.454
and how fucked up
the department is,
that's all.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.956
Just put Jimmy McNulty
up on your shoulders,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.192
march him
around the room,

00:58.292 --> 01:01.028
break out the keg.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.498
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.935
It was all
about me.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.238
You think
I didn't know that?

01:10.338 --> 01:13.341
You think we
all didn't know?

01:16.177 --> 01:20.181
Listen, this case
is gonna move forward,

01:20.281 --> 01:22.283
with you
or without you.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.384
This case
got her shot.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.386
I put a battery
up her ass

01:25.486 --> 01:27.221
and got her thinkin'
this case meant somethin'.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.622
And you know what?

01:28.722 --> 01:32.460
Burrell and Rawls and them,
they were right.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.794
This case means
exactly shit.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.431
Well, I know it meant
damn near nothing to me

01:37.531 --> 01:39.533
when you came in
beating the drum.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.769
But now we got that woman
in there, that good police,

01:41.869 --> 01:43.371
breathin' through
a fucking tube,

01:43.471 --> 01:45.072
because it meant
something to her.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.375
And the shooters
who dropped Kima?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.310
They're still
in the wind.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.645
And whoever sent
those motherfuckers
into that alley,

01:51.745 --> 01:53.147
he needs
to get got, too.

01:53.247 --> 01:56.116
So, you can stand there
drippin' with liquor-smell

01:56.217 --> 01:58.686
and self-pity
if you got a mind to.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.820
But this case...

01:59.920 --> 02:03.624
it means something, now.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.431
( door opens )

02:14.134 --> 02:17.905
( theme music playing )

02:20.208 --> 02:22.543
* If you walk
through the garden *

02:24.077 --> 02:26.480
* You better
watch your back *

02:27.681 --> 02:31.652
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

02:31.752 --> 02:34.288
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

02:35.756 --> 02:39.327
* If you walk
through Jesus *

02:39.427 --> 02:43.096
* He'll save your soul

02:43.197 --> 02:46.867
* You gotta
keep the devil *

02:46.967 --> 02:50.170
* Down in the hole

02:50.271 --> 02:53.941
* All the angels sing

02:54.041 --> 02:57.811
* About Jesus' mighty soul

02:57.911 --> 03:01.649
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

03:01.749 --> 03:05.353
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

03:05.453 --> 03:06.820
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

03:09.323 --> 03:13.160
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

03:13.261 --> 03:16.897
* You got to
keep the devil *

03:16.997 --> 03:20.534
* Way down in the hole

03:28.442 --> 03:31.211
* Way down in the hole

03:32.413 --> 03:34.515
* Way down in the hole

03:36.149 --> 03:39.587
* Way down in the hole

03:39.687 --> 03:42.756
* Way down in the hole.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.499
Man:
Yo, red ones.
Red tops.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.200
Shit, you hit 'em
again, yo?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.535
I been callin' them
all mornin'.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.203
They ain't
hit me back yet.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.540
Damn, we gonna
tap out by noon.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.276
Yo, Poot!
What we got
over there?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.445
200, maybe.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.416
What the fuck
is this?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.751
What the fuck
you think, nigga?
Fish food.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.322
Man, gimme my shit.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.027
Hey, yo,
head's up.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.595
( clearing throat )

04:21.695 --> 04:23.230
String.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.965
I need your pagers.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.567
All y'all,
the whole crew.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.307
Who else?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.142
Uh, Sterling,
Cass and Manny.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.610
All right,
go get them shits.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.479
How I'm gonna
talk to my girl?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.247
Talk to your hand, nigga,
that's the only girl you got.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.584
No more--
get outta here.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.719
Just get the fuck
outta here, man.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.255
No more pagers.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.691
Touts, lookouts,
off the air, all right?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.025
Nobody gonna use
these cellphones

04:52.125 --> 04:54.127
except for you
and Bodie,

04:54.227 --> 04:57.097
and y'all ain't gonna
say shit on these cellphones,
you understand me?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.800
We got the numbers
and we the only niggas
that need the numbers.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.169
Not your moms,
not your girl, nobody.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.504
You feel me?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.305
You use these phones
to set up a meet,

05:05.406 --> 05:08.776
go to that meet,
and talk face
to face, period.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.310
So, no more pay phones?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.680
Nigga, you deaf?
I said no phones,
no phones.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.782
Well, how I'm
gonna reach y'all?

05:16.484 --> 05:17.985
All right, top number's
for re-ups,

05:19.353 --> 05:21.355
second number's
for muscle.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.757
You need me, hit me
on the third number.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.593
Learn them shits,
then throw that shit away.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.127
You doin' this
in the towers, too?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.562
Doin' it
every goddamn place.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.097
Pagers,
pay phones is dead.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.799
All right?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.033
Yeah.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.669
Hey, yo, String.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.338
We need some re-up, man,
we gonna tap out by noon.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.540
Re-up from where?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.174
Y'all niggas
ain't heard?

05:41.274 --> 05:43.210
Knockos took
the main stash.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.978
Why the fuck you think
we changin' up?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.485
Back the fuck up,
youngun.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.721
These shits
ain't for you.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.658
All right.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.096
Cool.
There you go.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.833
There we go.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.368
All right.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.972
The gift of
corrected vision.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.108
Compliments
of the BPD.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.610
Dang, y'all are focused.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.912
What man
wouldn't be?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.759
Excuse me.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.664
They been cleanin' us
for the past few days.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.566
Last night they
burned us all the way.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.267
I knew it.
I fucking knew it.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.136
I swear to God,
Lester, I'm in this
motherfucker's head.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.172
Not a message
since early morning.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.608
Shit, I even had
to cut Prez loose.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.710
Send his ass on down
to Annapolis.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.645
- For what?
- State campaign
finance reports.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.413
I checked all the stuff
here in the city.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.348
But I got the feeling
Barksdale's money has legs.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.750
Aw, shit.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.252
All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
You don't hit these guys
the way we did

07:01.054 --> 07:02.623
and expect them
to stay in the pocket.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.224
Plus, they know
they dropped a police.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.926
Then we need
to change-up, too.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.761
C'mon.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.296
Shardene.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.031
Honey, this is
Detective McNulty,

07:11.131 --> 07:12.299
who's working with us.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.001
She works
at Orlando's,

07:14.101 --> 07:16.369
and she's been helping us out
there from time to time.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.639
And now I think that
she can see well enough

07:18.739 --> 07:20.307
to match faces
to voices.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.575
Lester, look,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.010
I'm scared
of this shit.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.746
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.082
We're gonna need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.718
Can I get
a cup of coffee?

07:30.818 --> 07:32.686
- What do you take in it?
- I'll get it.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.822
A little cream,
right?

07:40.828 --> 07:43.463
Those knockos motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.233
You can replace product
and currency.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.434
Yeah, he right.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.002
We gotta focus
on what's real, here.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.004
All of this
shit is real.
All of it!

07:51.104 --> 07:52.606
They wanna
put me in a box.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.709
Listen, I think what's
important is to take stock.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.045
Ask yourself what's out there
that can still hurt you.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.180
Where are you weak?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.249
Where do you need
to clean up?

08:08.255 --> 08:09.923
Think it through.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.892
Start with Orlando.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.093
If Orlando rolled,

08:13.193 --> 08:15.729
you know he talked about
the club, at least.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.098
That punk-ass nigga ain't talked
about shit else but the club.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.499
That's all
he knew about.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.834
He wasn't rollin'
with us like that.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.035
We kept him
on the outside.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.772
Alright, so, you walk away
from the club.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.473
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.441
They can't
make a connect.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.510
Yo, when this shit
start up?

08:30.611 --> 08:34.014
About the time that
your nephew beat that charge.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.884
After, maybe.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.119
When they found that witness
with the lead in his dome,

08:39.219 --> 08:40.754
the shit hit
the newspapers.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.856
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.658
Levy:
The security guard,

08:44.758 --> 08:46.660
the one whose testimony
sprung D'Angelo--

08:46.760 --> 08:48.195
Stringer:
Nakeisha Lyles.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.663
Bug-eyed ass bitch.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.998
But we hooked that up.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.833
So, she can still
hurt you, right?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.201
Yeah.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.437
The point is anybody
who can hurt you
can be put into play.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.140
The less I hear,
the better.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.441
All right, yo.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.410
Hey, yo,
lock that door.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.679
Hey, yo,
lock that door.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.148
( door closes )

09:08.248 --> 09:11.351
So, we got
Bird and Bey.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.020
Bird'll stand tall.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.823
He already in jail
and Bey about to go too.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.290
And Wee-Bey
hard like a rock.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.426
And then
we got Savino.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.429
Savino know it ain't nothin'
but an arm an' hammer charge,

09:22.529 --> 09:24.564
I mean, he ain't
gonna flip out

09:24.665 --> 09:25.899
over a motherfuckin'
three years.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.067
True.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.703
And then we got, uh, well,
that shit with Orlando,

09:29.803 --> 09:31.271
and the only problem there
was Little Man.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.007
Was.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.442
- Was.
- Was.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.378
Who else?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.914
It's over,
your wire's cold.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.851
The court orders give me a total
of 90 days on five phones.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.719
I'm doing
the full 90.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.989
You want to sit listening to
a bunch of broke-ass pay phones,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.190
have at it.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.325
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.295
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple, no problem.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.630
Hold on, Lieutenant.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.331
I gave you
those people.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.867
I decide
who comes back.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.569
But feel free
to speak your mind.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.337
If it were up to you.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.741
He asked you a question,
Lieutenant.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.978
I have no opinion.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.746
Take your pick.

10:12.846 --> 10:16.016
What's the name of that
old detective from pawnshop?

10:16.116 --> 10:20.888
And that young one,
Valchek's brain-dead
son-in-law.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.290
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.760
Keep 'em.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.664
Send back Sydnor
and Santangelo.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.003
And, Lieutenant,
if you want to do anything

10:36.103 --> 10:38.505
beyond listen
to those dead phones,

10:38.605 --> 10:42.242
you need
to brief me first, hmm?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.516
You did good,
Cedric.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.051
You play
your cards right,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.653
all the work you did
over the past few months

10:53.754 --> 10:55.923
will speak volumes
for you.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.657
And Major Spurgeon
is saying that

10:57.758 --> 10:59.727
he's retiring
at the end of November.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.528
Which opens up
the Northwest command.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.063
- That's right.
- Um-hm.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.001
Hi, Ronnie.
Come in.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.236
Sit.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.337
Sheila,
send Patrick in.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.672
Yes, sir.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.607
- Anything up?
- With me?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.710
Same shit,
different file.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.545
How about
the Barksdale thing?

11:18.645 --> 11:19.546
You've got
my office reports, right?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.248
Wire's dead,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.083
but we're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.052
Well, aside from that,
you're doing what?

11:25.152 --> 11:27.921
Pulling campaign
finance reports

11:28.021 --> 11:30.223
for every politician in
the city of Baltimore, right?

11:30.323 --> 11:33.593
I am?
We are?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.996
And making calls
to some contributors,

11:36.096 --> 11:40.100
asking questions,
doing background checks.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.469
I don't know
anything about this.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.005
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck
is all this going?

11:45.105 --> 11:48.675
Those are public reports,
right?

11:48.776 --> 11:50.510
I mean...

11:50.610 --> 11:54.047
no one on that detail
has come to me for
any kind of subpoena.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.083
You've got back-doored,
too, huh?

11:56.183 --> 12:00.620
Well, just so there's
no misunderstanding,

12:00.720 --> 12:03.323
I want to
give you this.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.294
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee,

12:07.394 --> 12:11.131
representing the return of
five separate contributions,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.665
totaling $4,500.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.869
Also, copies
of the checks

12:15.969 --> 12:17.905
from the donor are
represented in there, too.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.607
Well, kinda like Caesar's wife
and all that shit.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.843
The only thing that
we can come up with

12:22.943 --> 12:24.677
were those five checks.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.481
And I don't know those people
and I don't know why they gave.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.418
That money's gonna be returned
to the donors immediately.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.021
Guys, listen to me.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.356
I don't know
a fucking thing

12:36.456 --> 12:39.226
about anyone looking at
campaign contributions.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.029
Be that as it may,

12:42.129 --> 12:44.431
this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.567
Ronnie, I want you
to take that back

12:47.667 --> 12:51.138
to whoever's on the hunt
and I want you to tell 'em,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.773
they've got
no quarrel with me.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.147
- What's up, String?
- Yo.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.619
So, y'all want
to get with me?

13:06.719 --> 13:08.321
Yeah, we need
to holler at your boy,

13:08.421 --> 13:10.891
you know, the one that
dimed on Omar's bitch.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.692
Can't recall
his name.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.928
Which one?

13:15.028 --> 13:17.664
You know, the one that was
at the Greek's that night.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.566
And we paid him
for the lookout.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.202
What y'all
need him for?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.137
What's it to you?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.839
You ain't got
to worry about him.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.174
Say what?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.475
He's gone,
he's out the game.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.844
Out the game?

13:30.944 --> 13:34.247
Yo, the man asked you
a simple question.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.416
Look, I don't mean
y'all no disrespect.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.351
You know I don't.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.954
But I am sitting here
tellin' you that
the boy is out the game.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.856
And even if he wasn't
out the game,

13:42.956 --> 13:44.858
he wouldn't be
no problem.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.560
But you know we just want
to talk to him, Dee.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.966
Avon...

13:53.066 --> 13:56.136
let the boy be.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.344
Just let him be.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.250
( music playing )

14:51.691 --> 14:53.293
( feedback )

14:53.393 --> 14:56.529
Honey, just leave
the damn thing alone.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.564
Where'd you
get these, man?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.766
Prevas.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.034
Broadway market?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.635
Best chili dogs
in the city.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
Naw, man, not even.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.074
I'll give you 10 bucks
if you can name a better dog.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.575
George's Lunch,
on Light Street.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.044
The Greek joint?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.845
They closed that place
back when you were still

15:12.946 --> 15:14.081
suckin' on your
mama's nipples, man.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.815
Your mama's nipples?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.650
Was suckin' on
these plums last night.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.186
- You owe me 10.
- Uh-uh.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.988
I said to name a better dog
you can have today,

15:21.088 --> 15:22.222
not in world history.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
You just said
a better dog, dawg.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.158
Can you go get
that dog right now?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.793
You cannot go get
that dog right now.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.128
You said
the best fucking dog.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.362
Physically,
physically--

15:29.462 --> 15:30.763
Will you Ivy Leaguers
please keep it down?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.100
I can't hear
a goddamn thing!

15:39.806 --> 15:42.942
Woman:
You'd know how much I got
if you laid somethin' on me.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.811
Man:
Oh, you like
that freeze, huh?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.013
If you holdin'.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.247
I'm fixin' to be.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.748
That's why I'm here,
you know...

15:48.848 --> 15:51.018
to discuss some things.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.619
Well, when you
done discussin',

15:53.920 --> 15:55.555
you come back.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.624
( door opens )

15:59.726 --> 16:01.328
All right, then.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.663
Hold that pose
right there, shorty.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.099
I'ma hook you up
with some uncut.

16:06.199 --> 16:10.303
Yo, y'all niggas
talk too damn much, man.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.175
( door closes )

16:17.910 --> 16:18.745
Who the fuck
is she?

16:18.845 --> 16:20.647
Housing police?

16:20.747 --> 16:24.751
Naw, she's one of
them civilians they got
doin' security.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.220
Housing cops wear
the grey uniforms.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.122
So, she's not armed
or nothin'.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.757
Do she look it?

16:30.857 --> 16:32.992
( police radio chatter )

16:36.196 --> 16:37.830
You leavin' early.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.101
I was early,
I worked the lunch crowd.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.204
( rap music playing )

16:49.109 --> 16:51.611
( door closes )

16:51.711 --> 16:53.580
She's out.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.649
Anything?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.318
Table scraps.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.220
What we want is being
said in that office,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.155
and there ain't no good reason
for Shardene to be in there

17:02.255 --> 17:03.723
long enough
for us to get it.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.194
Take it out,
I can't do this anymore.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.162
You won't have to,
darlin'.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.463
I think they're gonna look
at me and they're gonna know.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.998
I need to quit.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.067
I don't need you wearin'
this wire, all right, honey?

17:14.166 --> 17:18.305
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.273
Oh, lookit this
country nigga.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.644
Damn, Wallace.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.313
Wally!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.582
He kept cryin'
'til I sent him bus money.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.185
All right, yo, I just got
tired of that same ole,

17:32.285 --> 17:35.488
same ole country scenery,
it was just too slow for me, yo.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.325
Yeah, but did you get
some of that country ass?

17:38.425 --> 17:40.527
And if he did,
it was on four legs.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.295
Nigga, there wasn't
no farms down there, man,

17:42.395 --> 17:44.131
but they did have
some bamas though, man.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.733
They got their Saturday night
shit down at, down at Sears.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.169
They was like,
you know.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.037
Tears, right?.
You were about to cry.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.639
That where you got them
die-hards, right there?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.873
Man, these Timbs.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.342
Yeah, they Timbs, man.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.210
I can see the tree
on the side of 'em.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.479
So, you gonna put me
back on the money?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.848
Hold, hold.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.016
Look, if we do
put you back on,

18:04.117 --> 18:06.219
you gonna have to start out
as lookout, man.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.288
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.458
I mean, c'mon, a real man'd
stay with his people,

18:11.558 --> 18:13.426
he wouldn't run
at the first sight
of some blood, you know.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.462
Y'all can still holler
five-o, right?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.797
If he want back on the money,
he back on the money.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.766
If he want it.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.802
My man might be thinkin' about
goin' back to Edmondson,

18:22.902 --> 18:24.871
like we talked about,
right?

18:28.175 --> 18:31.178
C'mon, nigga,
let's walk.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.614
Dawg, you ain't cornhole
no animal for real, did you?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.217
Go 'head, Poot.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.719
Yo, don't be fuckin'
with my Sean John.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.589
McNulty:
So who caught it?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.157
Garvey.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.058
He knows about
the whole witness angle,

18:46.159 --> 18:47.827
but he doesn't want
to run it up to the bosses

18:47.927 --> 18:49.262
until he knows more.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.364
Why ace
Nakeisha Lyles now?

18:51.464 --> 18:54.000
Because now they know
we're for real.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.968
Avon's cleaning house
all the way.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.737
First the phones
go dead,

18:57.837 --> 19:00.307
and then anyone he thinks
we might be able to flip.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.880
What about the boy?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.483
Fuck me.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.154
We took him down
to the shore on a Friday

19:15.255 --> 19:16.389
and the plan was
to bring him back up

19:16.489 --> 19:17.657
on the Monday
for the grand jury.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.059
- And what happened?
- Greggs got shot.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.661
Trooper Reese?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.297
This is Lieutenant Daniels
with the Baltimore department.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.765
Is there someone that can
take a run out near Cambridge,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.368
check on a kid
we got stashed down there?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.637
- Why don't you call him?
- No, there's no phone
where he's staying.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.739
- Can you hang on?
- I'll hold, yeah.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.275
Have Sydnor pull a car
from motor pool.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.076
We get the kid
back up here tonight,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.846
he sleeps on my sofa,
and we grand-jury him
in the morning.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.115
What about
your stripper?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.284
The woman's
got heart.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.353
I mean,
I want her protected.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.787
No more bodies, hear?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.823
Well, I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.459
I got no problem
with that.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.261
Remember who you are,
Detective.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.862
Protect and serve,
Lieutenant.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.332
Protect and serve.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.569
I'm sayin',
this here game,

20:02.669 --> 20:04.203
it ain't gonna work
for you no more, man.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.207
You leavin',
you stirred up some shit.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.577
I'm sayin' it ain't
your fault or nothin'.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.711
Yo, Dee, look.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.580
I appreciate what you
tryin' to say and all,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.948
but I grew up
in the Courts, all right?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.417
I been with
them niggas since...

20:17.517 --> 20:19.352
since, shit,
forever.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.490
I guess this is home,
right?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.692
You ain't hearin' me,
Wallace.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.794
You ain't hearin' me.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.829
Anybody ask you
whether you in this game,

20:29.929 --> 20:32.499
you tell them you in it
for life, all right?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.401
You play it hard,
you play it tight

20:34.501 --> 20:37.036
and make sure
niggas know you gonna
stand by your people.

20:37.136 --> 20:40.707
No loose talk,
no second thoughts,
and no snitchin'.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.710
Play it like that.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.012
( honking )

20:50.817 --> 20:52.251
Hey.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.986
What you doin' down
in the PJs, you lost?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.322
I'm lookin'
for you.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.456
You know I be
down here workin'.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.625
You know a working man
got to eat.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.695
My favorite
spicy fish cakes?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.331
On the saltines
with the mustard.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.232
You gonna make me cry,
you know.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.368
I need to get up outta here
and get back to it.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.271
- You be safe.
- You, too.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.506
All right.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.877
This here.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.012
Sterling's, baby.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.280
We about to feast.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.682
What the hell
is Sterling's?

21:22.782 --> 21:25.017
Sterling's, you know
up on 29th Street?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.252
Don't you
know nothin'?

21:26.353 --> 21:27.754
Shit, if it ain't
up on the Westside,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.221
I don't know shit, yo.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.691
'Cause this shit,
this is me, yo.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.792
Right here.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.961
Who was that, your new girl
or somethin'?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.731
Nah, nigga,
that's my mom.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.808
You know
Senator Davis?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.710
No, sir.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.845
Lieutenant.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.781
Clay wanted
to meet you,

21:54.881 --> 21:57.884
see if there was
any help he can offer.

21:59.852 --> 22:00.987
Help?

22:01.087 --> 22:04.557
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports

22:04.657 --> 22:07.360
and checking up on some
of the contributors.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.129
I wanted to reassure you
on that front.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.999
I'm not involved
in drugs, Lieutenant.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.668
Good.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.304
And this business
with the senator's driver.

22:18.405 --> 22:21.240
Mr. Price.
Damien.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.175
Day-Day.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.677
This uh...

22:24.777 --> 22:27.013
business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding

22:28.881 --> 22:31.150
that is really of
no concern to the police.

22:31.250 --> 22:34.987
He had $20,000
of cash on him,

22:35.087 --> 22:38.491
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.428
The money was banded
and manicured by denomination.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.362
( chuckling )
This is...

22:43.463 --> 22:45.965
there's no crime here.

22:46.065 --> 22:49.268
That was money that Damien
already had on him

22:49.368 --> 22:51.003
when he drove down
to Franklin Terrace.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.906
Money from
a cash bar fund raiser
the previous weekend.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.844
We filed an amended
finance report that shows--

22:57.944 --> 23:00.613
Fine.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.049
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.653
I think we are
in agreement on that.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.054
No, there was PC
for the search.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.890
You're saying
you have evidence

23:10.990 --> 23:13.893
that a senatorial aide
is involved in drugs?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.962
I'm saying, we had reason
to stop Mr. Price

23:17.096 --> 23:18.931
and effect
a body search,

23:19.031 --> 23:23.235
after which we discovered
$20,000 in cash in banded,
manicured bills.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.771
That's all I'm saying.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.907
Erv, will you explain
to this motherfucker

23:28.007 --> 23:29.842
just what the fuck it is
he's doing here?

23:29.942 --> 23:30.877
Lieutenant Daniels--

23:30.977 --> 23:32.144
Excuse me, sir.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.447
But it's pretty basic.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.616
If the senator is not involved
in anything illegal,

23:36.716 --> 23:37.917
then he doesn't
need to worry.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.352
I can't be any clearer
about it than that.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.921
Fool, what do you think?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.223
That we know anything
about who gives money?

23:44.323 --> 23:48.260
That we give a damn
about who they are
or what they want?

23:48.360 --> 23:52.064
We have no way of running
down them or their stories.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.700
We don't care.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.136
We just cash the damn checks,
count the votes and move on.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.543
Anything else,
Deputy Burrell?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.648
Gentlemen.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.623
Motherfucker, you need
to put his ass on a footpost

24:16.723 --> 24:18.725
so far out
in the sticks

24:18.825 --> 24:21.528
that he gonna see
the Philadelphia cops
walkin' towards him.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.564
Now, you ain't just
talkin' to me now, Erv.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.466
You talkin'
to the mayor,

24:27.567 --> 24:30.069
the city caucus,
the state central committee.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.072
And right now,
you got your hand
in our pocket.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.607
18, baby!

24:34.707 --> 24:37.209
* Eight, eight, eight,
eight, eight *

24:37.309 --> 24:39.345
* Eight, eight,
eight, eight *

24:39.445 --> 24:41.480
* Eight, eight, eight,
eight. *

24:41.581 --> 24:43.950
18 with a bullet, baby.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.084
Yeah!

24:45.184 --> 24:47.720
Detective Sergeant Hauk
reporting for duty, sir.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.592
And the best part?
Carver's 37.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.628
"You know, it helps if you
know 'em by the numbers.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.564
It makes you sound
more professional.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.265
Fucking Carver.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.700
He gets back from
in-service training,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.268
he's gonna
kiss the stripes,

25:02.368 --> 25:03.903
I'm gonna make him
kiss the the strips.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.872
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.239
Appreciate it.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.544
Sergeant Hauk?

25:11.644 --> 25:14.246
God help us.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.515
( phone ringing )

25:16.616 --> 25:18.117
Daniels.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.919
Man:
Yeah, Daniels,
this is Trooper Reese.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.388
Grandmother says the kid's
been gone two days.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.824
Wallace is
out of pocket.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.158
Two days.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.696
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.232
( rap music playing )

25:35.101 --> 25:37.003
Ain't no re-up
in the towers, neither?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.271
Naw, shop dead, yo.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.040
All right.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.159
What up, man?

26:00.259 --> 26:01.828
Same ole, same ole.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.030
What's up
with that boy?

26:04.130 --> 26:06.298
Aw, man.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.467
He's just a punk,
that's all.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.236
Dee put him back
on the count though.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.338
Oh, word?

26:12.438 --> 26:14.440
I heard he was
out the game.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.676
He was,
but he back now.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.778
Where he been at?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.246
Down his granny house,
he says.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.514
( laughing )

26:22.615 --> 26:24.717
Right,
his granny house.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.787
I heard he damn near
shit his pants

26:27.887 --> 26:29.989
when he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.492
He just ain't built
for this, you know.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.994
His heart pump
Kool-Aid.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.462
Right.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.264
What about you?

26:38.364 --> 26:40.967
You built
for this shit?

26:42.401 --> 26:43.970
No doubt.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.140
You ready
to put the work in?

26:51.343 --> 26:53.012
You got heat?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.222
All right, soldier.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.075
( dogs barking )

27:40.226 --> 27:42.695
It's clear upstairs.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.541
No extension cords.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.977
- No juice boxes.
- No Wallace.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.346
Dag, boy,

28:00.446 --> 28:04.216
Chink Bob's never be puttin'
no napkins in the bag.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.253
Motherfucker,
because napkins
expensive and shit.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.587
So is my money.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.356
A'ight, c'mon, go,
somethin' to eat?

28:11.724 --> 28:13.793
Y'all know what's here.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.429
Let's go, y'all need to get
up in this Chinese food.

28:17.529 --> 28:22.001
'cause, you know, I'm lookin'
kinda needy right about now.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.537
What you
listenin' to?

28:25.637 --> 28:27.073
Hold up,
take them plates first.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.041
Big Tymers, their new video
on "106 and Park".

28:29.141 --> 28:30.242
106 and Park?

28:30.342 --> 28:31.310
- The joint is vicious.
- It's vicious?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.012
- Yeah.
- For real?

28:33.112 --> 28:34.413
What they call you, little man?
Buff, 'cause I got the stuff.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.048
- You got the stuff?
- Yeah.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.585
Well, Buff, you need to get up
in these eggrolls or somethin'.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.521
Any word
on the kid?

28:42.621 --> 28:45.257
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his "B" of "I".

28:45.357 --> 28:48.094
If he's down there,
he ain't got no profile.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.763
We got lookouts to every car
in the western and central,

28:50.863 --> 28:52.832
and we're trying for
an address on his mother.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.601
Detective.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.436
Lieutenant.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.905
Wire's dead,

28:59.005 --> 29:01.073
so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.609
Sydnor we have a little longer,
because Cantrell still owes me.

29:03.709 --> 29:06.645
You okay
with Rawls?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.347
I gave him
his clearance, right?

29:08.447 --> 29:09.648
What's he gonna
do to me?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.384
Keep it warm,
Sanny.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.591
What's that?

29:19.691 --> 29:20.659
Plans for what
is now Orlando's.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.061
The upper floors.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.296
McNulty:
This is the property
next door.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.298
- Herc: How'd you get
them so quick?
- Costar search.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.767
Plan is to get a remote mic
into the office.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.569
Maybe even some
fiber-optics.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.172
McNulty:
Only we don't know where
Avon's office is yet.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.307
Which is where Shardene
helps us out in a big way.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.878
What she gonna do?
Take out a tape measure and ask
Avon to hold the other end?

29:38.978 --> 29:40.779
Ain't none-a y'all ever
been in the military?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.950
How do you learn
a 30 inch, quick-time?

29:48.154 --> 29:50.722
Draft-dodgin',
peace-freaks, huh?

29:50.823 --> 29:53.659
Get me a ruler
and some string.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.194
Why me?

30:04.270 --> 30:05.938
Why? Why?

30:06.038 --> 30:07.539
Because the man
said so, that's why.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.308
Wallace
ain't no snitch.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.676
Man, how you know?

30:10.776 --> 30:12.544
How you know where
he been runnin' to?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.380
He was gettin' high.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.115
I seen him cop.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.919
He probably went
down to the shore
to clean that shit up.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.255
Man, if he usin',
then you know
he ain't reliable.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.623
C'mon, think.

30:24.723 --> 30:27.026
Look, the man gave
the word, all right?

30:27.126 --> 30:29.595
We either step up
or we step the fuck off.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.065
That's the game, yo.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.902
That's the fucking game.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.612
Cedric.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.949
You ever hear of
an elected official

30:50.049 --> 30:52.952
in Baltimore
giving money back?

30:54.620 --> 30:57.856
Whatever you're doing,
you scared my boss shitless.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.359
He calls me in
and hands me that.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.831
( knocking )

31:05.932 --> 31:10.069
Forgive me for prying
into the details
of our investigation.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.837
I know,
it's annoying.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.539
But what the hell
are you guys doing?

31:14.173 --> 31:16.008
Yeah?

31:16.108 --> 31:18.110
Is that Avon's money?

31:21.580 --> 31:23.983
Eastside addresses,

31:24.083 --> 31:25.918
but maybe Barksdale has fronts
we don't know about.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.586
State's attorney's
returning this?

31:27.686 --> 31:29.155
Fast as he can.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.123
You all are stirring
some shit here.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.624
Why didn't you
tell me?

31:32.724 --> 31:35.194
Aren't you better off
that we didn't?

31:58.217 --> 32:00.286
I remember my mom
used to bring me in here.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.454
We used to go to this place
called Fruit Fantasy.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.156
Like orange soda,
some shit like that?

32:04.256 --> 32:05.657
Naw, these shits
was fresh.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.260
My mom used to pour
mad Bacardi in hers though.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.895
Wasn't much she didn't
pour it into.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.297
Look at you, man,
sittin' here,

32:11.397 --> 32:12.931
talkin' about your momma
like you still a kid.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.600
Well, I got
to thinkin' on her.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.669
Your ass ain't got to be hard
all the goddamn time, neither.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.972
Soft link
break the chain.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.911
So what're you,
a boy or a man?

32:26.012 --> 32:28.014
I'm a man.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.154
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?

32:35.254 --> 32:39.291
* Put your head
on my shoulder... *

32:39.391 --> 32:42.261
( door opens )

32:56.208 --> 32:57.976
- Okay, on this floor...
- Mm-hm.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.511
...it's the second room
from the rear.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.114
The stairs start
30 paces from the front,

33:02.214 --> 33:04.983
there's 24 stairs,
about a foot each.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.485
When you get
to the top floor,

33:06.585 --> 33:09.288
it's eight paces to the door
of the dressing room

33:09.388 --> 33:11.023
and then another 10
to the back room.

33:11.123 --> 33:14.560
80 to 110 in
from the front.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.966
Third floor of
this building is vacant.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.602
Otherwise
we'd need a warrant.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.273
15.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.375
- Here take 10.
- 15.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.876
Motherfucker,
I don't see no meter.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.611
Get the fuck
outta here.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.751
It's 2:30
in the morning.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.954
Easy now.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.523
Hole only needs to be
as big as your finger.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.393
Not those Esskay-sausage
lookin' fingers you got.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.694
You know what
big hands mean.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.564
You know what
big hands mean, right?

33:53.799 --> 33:55.167
Lieutenant...

33:55.267 --> 33:57.603
I just pulled a fresh address
for Wallace's mother.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.306
We're okay here.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.379
Where y'all at?

34:10.649 --> 34:13.319
A'ight, when I find y'all,
y'all gonna get it.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.255
You better
come out now.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.460
Where y'all at?

34:26.565 --> 34:29.135
Yo, I'm not even playin'
with y'all right about now.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.536
You hear me?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.947
Game over.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.616
Where the fuck
y'all at?

34:44.716 --> 34:47.619
A'ight, when I find y'all,
I'm beatin' your asses.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.020
Now, where y'all at?

34:49.121 --> 34:51.590
A'ight, don't
let me find y'all.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.098
Yo, check this, Poot.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.368
Little Man left
his player and shit.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.316
Man, you--

35:17.416 --> 35:20.352
you's a weak-ass
nigga, man.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.323
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.658
Yo, y'all my niggas, yo.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.694
You fuckin' brought
this on yourself, man.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.062
- We boys!
- You brought this
on yourself.

35:31.163 --> 35:34.099
Why it gotta
be like this, yo?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.001
You my niggas from BC,
remember that?

35:36.101 --> 35:38.804
C'mon, wettin'
your fucking pants
like you a little boy.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.807
Be a man!

35:41.907 --> 35:43.742
Stand up like
a motherfuckin' man.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.345
- Y'all my niggas, yo.
- You said you a fuckin' man.

35:46.445 --> 35:50.249
- Stand up straight!
- That's us, man.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.489
Do it God damn it,
if you gon--

36:03.262 --> 36:06.232
( groaning )

36:33.625 --> 36:34.993
Darcia Wallace?

36:35.093 --> 36:36.828
We're looking
for your son.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.564
Thought you might help us
out as to his whereabouts.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.998
Where-a-who?

36:40.098 --> 36:42.768
Shit, I be lookin' for that
smart little nigger, too.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.337
- Boy took me
for 10 dollars.
- Recently?

36:45.437 --> 36:46.805
Man:
Fuck is goin' on
out there?!

36:46.905 --> 36:48.474
Nothin'.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.209
Couple of police,
interruptin' me,

36:51.310 --> 36:53.211
while I'm tryin'
to get my drink on.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.813
Look, your son
might be in some danger.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.148
He gonna be in some danger
right here, he shows up.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.451
Snatched that 10 out
my purse without askin'.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.820
I'll slap the bright
out his eyes.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.355
Here's my card.

37:03.455 --> 37:06.258
You run into him,
you call me.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.845
( footsteps )

37:28.213 --> 37:30.148
( door opening )

37:30.248 --> 37:32.384
- Y'all got a table?
- Over there, man.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.754
All right, let's see
what we got here.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.460
He's packing shit up.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.781
What you scratchin'
your head for, man?

38:02.881 --> 38:05.484
How y'all get the safe in here
and you can't get it out?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.455
Just dial 911 and talk
to whoever pick up.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.956
Don't say your name
or nothin',

38:11.056 --> 38:13.392
just say there's been
an animal hurt inside

38:13.492 --> 38:16.061
that house right there,
and then you hang up.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.300
Dee:
What up?

38:22.401 --> 38:24.102
Hey, so what do you
need from me?

38:24.202 --> 38:26.772
( door opens )

38:28.306 --> 38:32.143
I want you to run up to NYC
to pick up a little something.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.346
Look, I know
we tapped and all.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.281
Shit, everybody
waitin' on the re-up,

38:36.382 --> 38:37.683
but I never made
that run before.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.285
Listen, right now, man,
I don't feel like I have

38:40.386 --> 38:42.253
that many people around me
I can really trust.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.155
Not like I can kin.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.492
You follow me?

38:46.592 --> 38:48.193
- All right.
- Well, how much is it?

38:48.293 --> 38:50.362
We just need
to maintain.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.532
Put out enough so we can
keep hold of them towers.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.704
When?

38:58.804 --> 39:00.472
Tonight!

39:02.708 --> 39:04.776
A'ight.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.412
What am I drivin'?

39:06.512 --> 39:09.180
A rental, no flash.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.616
Where from?

39:10.716 --> 39:12.317
I don't know
where from.

39:12.418 --> 39:15.487
( phone ringing )

39:15.587 --> 39:18.056
- Daniels: Yeah?
- We got somethin' real.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.659
- I'm on my way.
- All right.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.841
Oh...

39:39.778 --> 39:41.613
shit!

39:44.249 --> 39:47.586
- Which one?
- Daniels: The rental there,
the Taurus.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.194
I gotta say,
Lieutenant,

39:56.294 --> 39:58.497
you got mad suction
with the federales.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.481
( police radio chatter )

40:15.581 --> 40:18.249
( engine starts )

40:18.349 --> 40:20.886
( phone ringing )

40:23.555 --> 40:25.991
Yeah, Daniels.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.263
Yeah.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.432
Where?

40:37.803 --> 40:39.605
Wallace?

41:22.347 --> 41:24.482
Poor fucking kid.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.655
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out
of the box.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.701
He was in there changing
his fucking clothes.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.172
You believe that?

41:47.272 --> 41:49.507
Boy had to get
himself correct.

41:56.381 --> 41:58.316
( engine starts )

41:58.416 --> 41:59.618
We're on.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.352
No need
for an eyeball.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.088
Let the satellite
do the work.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.306
How 'bout
I call my lawyer,

42:21.406 --> 42:25.076
have him explain that whole
profilin' thing to you.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.746
Mr. Barksdale,
our toll booth cameras

42:27.846 --> 42:30.215
have you on the G.W. Bridge
at 23:10 hours,

42:30.315 --> 42:32.718
and then re-entering
the turnpike at the same exit

42:32.818 --> 42:34.519
35 minutes later.

42:34.620 --> 42:37.188
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?

42:38.590 --> 42:40.892
Step out of
the car, sir.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.695
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.497
Turn around, face the car,
put your hands on the roof.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.834
Are you carrying
any weapons, sir?

42:48.934 --> 42:50.769
- No.
- Any knives, any needles?

42:50.869 --> 42:53.905
- No.
- Any illegal substances
I should know about?

42:54.005 --> 42:55.273
Okay.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.675
Spread your
legs back.

42:56.775 --> 42:58.644
Spread your legs
back more.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.350
Okay, slowly bring your
right arm around your back.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.653
Now bring
the other one.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.302
- Remember me?
- Lawyer.

43:24.402 --> 43:26.437
Easy. We're just
getting started.

43:26.537 --> 43:27.873
Lawyer,
motherfucker.

43:27.973 --> 43:30.809
Okay, so you're hard,
but guess what?

43:30.909 --> 43:32.277
- I could give a fuck.
- You?

43:32.377 --> 43:34.079
I'm tired
of your games.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.715
What, you want me
to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

43:36.815 --> 43:38.549
No game
we need to run.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.451
You're popped
with a kilo of uncut.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.453
Not that you
messed up.

43:42.553 --> 43:43.822
I mean, you did
everything right.

43:43.922 --> 43:45.891
Speed limit, turn signals,
working taillights.

43:45.991 --> 43:47.659
Question
you gotta ask is,

43:47.759 --> 43:50.095
how'd those troopers
know to pull you over?

43:50.195 --> 43:52.764
Someone else fucked up,
you followin' me?

43:52.864 --> 43:54.700
But it's you
they're gonna blame

43:54.800 --> 43:56.334
and you who's gonna
do the jolt.

43:56.434 --> 43:58.636
Lawyer.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.706
That'd be Levy,
right?

44:00.806 --> 44:04.142
He's gettin' paid
by your uncle, is that right?

44:04.242 --> 44:08.046
Oh, yeah, he's looking out
for your interests.

44:08.146 --> 44:09.480
More than you.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.917
Listen...

44:12.017 --> 44:14.853
I ain't sayin'
another damn thing

44:14.953 --> 44:18.156
to nobody
but my lawyer.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.664
Oh, by the way,
your boy Wallace?

44:26.765 --> 44:28.266
Shot dead
in the low-rises.

44:28.366 --> 44:31.002
That's how y'all take care
of your own, right?

44:32.738 --> 44:34.906
You're a lyin'
motherfucker.

44:36.307 --> 44:37.675
So, what, what?

44:37.776 --> 44:39.845
You want me to write
a letter to his mom, too?

44:39.945 --> 44:42.881
Get the fuck
outta here.

44:57.428 --> 44:59.865
Brianna:
You ain't have to send him
the way you did.

45:01.232 --> 45:02.934
In one car?

45:03.034 --> 45:04.770
He should've been
trailin' a mule.

45:04.870 --> 45:07.205
95 or on the train,
it don't make no difference,

45:07.305 --> 45:08.740
he shouldn't have
been out there alone.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.108
Look here, Brianna--

45:10.208 --> 45:12.110
Ain't you ever heard
of a trap-car?

45:12.210 --> 45:14.345
You send my son to New York
in a motherfuckin' rental

45:16.347 --> 45:18.416
and then you just let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

45:18.516 --> 45:19.951
I'm sorry
it went like it did.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.020
Sorry ain't gonna bring
that boy out of prison.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.890
Just better make sure
that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, a'ight?

45:24.990 --> 45:27.625
D'Angelo gonna have
to do his part.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.060
Meaning what?

45:29.160 --> 45:30.862
You like the car
you drivin' there, right?

45:30.962 --> 45:32.730
You like this crib?

45:32.831 --> 45:34.432
I put you in this crib.
You like it?

45:34.532 --> 45:37.869
Yeah, meaning, we all
got a lot to protect here.

45:37.969 --> 45:39.504
You need to remind him
of that.

45:39.604 --> 45:42.140
So, when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.

45:48.679 --> 45:50.648
You ain't gotta
worry about my child,

45:50.748 --> 45:53.451
I raised that boy,

45:53.551 --> 45:55.520
and I raised him right.

46:03.929 --> 46:06.597
It wasn't me
who fucked up.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.233
Oh, really?

46:08.333 --> 46:10.335
So, who did?

46:10.435 --> 46:11.602
Why the fuck
are we here?

46:11.702 --> 46:13.138
Listen,
all you need to do

46:13.238 --> 46:14.739
is keep your head
through the bail hearing,

46:14.840 --> 46:17.208
we got a good shot
at bringing you home here.

46:17.308 --> 46:19.710
Then what, hmm?

46:19.811 --> 46:21.980
Who gonna take the weight
for all the shit

46:22.080 --> 46:24.115
in the trunk
of that car?

46:28.553 --> 46:30.355
Where's Wallace at?

46:34.092 --> 46:37.395
Where's the boy,
String?

46:38.729 --> 46:41.466
D'Angelo,
shut your mouth.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.770
Where's Wallace?

46:45.871 --> 46:48.239
That's all
I want to know.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.976
Kid, you better think.

46:51.076 --> 46:52.443
Where the fuck
is Wallace, huh?

46:54.679 --> 46:56.347
String?! String?!

46:56.447 --> 46:58.449
Look at me.
Look at me!

46:58.549 --> 47:00.518
Where the fuck
is Wallace, huh?!

47:00.618 --> 47:03.188
I don't want this
Pay Less-wearin' motherfucker
representin' me.

47:03.288 --> 47:05.156
I'ma get my own man,
all right?

47:05.256 --> 47:06.657
So, just get back
in your car

47:06.757 --> 47:09.827
and get the fuck
back down south.

47:09.928 --> 47:11.396
All right, you stupid
motherfucker.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.031
You made
your decision.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.133
Yeah,
I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?

47:15.233 --> 47:16.601
Where the fuck
is Wallace?

47:16.701 --> 47:18.803
Where's Wallace,
String?!

47:18.904 --> 47:20.471
String, where the fuck
is Wallace?

47:22.373 --> 47:23.674
Huh?!
Stringer!

47:23.774 --> 47:25.476
Burrell:
Bring him in.
You're done.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.212
Why?

47:27.312 --> 47:29.014
We have the charge
whenever we want it.

47:29.114 --> 47:31.649
Why not stay up on the bug
we've got in his office?

47:31.749 --> 47:34.052
The bug you didn't
brief me about.

47:34.152 --> 47:36.487
I thought your little bird
told you everything we did,

47:38.056 --> 47:39.524
a minute after we did it.

47:39.624 --> 47:41.092
One of our people
got hurt.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.693
That's supposed
to mean something.

47:42.793 --> 47:44.095
We're hunting
her shooters,

47:44.195 --> 47:47.032
and by the grace of God
and your good work,

47:47.132 --> 47:50.268
we've got a viable case
on our main target.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.503
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase

47:53.939 --> 47:55.873
from New York
and bring it all home.

47:55.974 --> 47:57.642
And what about Stringer,
his number two?

47:57.742 --> 47:59.777
He slipped off the hook
when we lost the boy witness.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.947
We've done
all we can.

48:02.047 --> 48:03.915
Are you hearing me?

48:04.015 --> 48:06.517
These are the people responsible
for dropping a police.

48:07.552 --> 48:08.786
Not just the shooters,

48:08.886 --> 48:10.721
but the ones who
make the dirt happen.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.523
I'm trying to put
them down for real,

48:12.623 --> 48:13.824
not for some
short-time bit.

48:13.925 --> 48:17.295
That all you're
trying to do?

48:17.395 --> 48:19.397
If that's all
you're trying to do,

48:19.497 --> 48:21.766
how is it you have people
pulling campaign records

48:21.866 --> 48:23.334
and finance reports?

48:23.434 --> 48:25.903
The fuck has that got
to do with anything?!

48:26.004 --> 48:28.206
The money is part
of my case.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.641
There might've been
a time when I was willing

48:30.741 --> 48:33.044
to say otherwise to let
you and all your friends

48:33.144 --> 48:34.912
hide some of that dirt.
But not now.

48:35.013 --> 48:36.581
You want to talk
about dirt?

48:36.681 --> 48:38.183
Have at it.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.251
Talk some shit about
your Eastern District days.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.153
Talk some shit about
what was going on back

48:42.253 --> 48:44.389
when you was runnin' wild
in the DEU.

48:44.489 --> 48:46.591
That's just talk.

48:46.691 --> 48:47.758
Just talk?

48:47.858 --> 48:49.694
( chuckling )

48:54.832 --> 48:57.969
FBI field reports.

48:58.069 --> 49:01.106
You came into
a lot of money, quick.

49:02.373 --> 49:04.342
And you can go to jail
just as quick,

49:04.442 --> 49:08.146
if I start asking
the right questions.

49:08.246 --> 49:11.016
This case ends
or you are done.

49:11.116 --> 49:13.618
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.

49:13.718 --> 49:16.387
I'll have your major
debrief your detectives

49:16.487 --> 49:18.589
and type
the warrants himself.

49:18.689 --> 49:21.626
This case is done!

49:25.163 --> 49:27.232
You do what you feel.

49:27.332 --> 49:29.834
You wanna pull Avon
in on half a case?

49:29.934 --> 49:31.336
You go ahead.

49:31.436 --> 49:33.238
You wanna put my shit
in the street?

49:33.338 --> 49:34.772
Feel free.

49:34.872 --> 49:36.874
But the Eastern
had a lot of stories.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.243
Mine ain't
the only one.

49:38.343 --> 49:41.012
A lot of people came
through that district.

49:41.112 --> 49:44.349
If you were gonna do me,
I'd already be done.

49:44.449 --> 49:48.319
But there ain't nothing you
fear more than a bad headline,

49:48.419 --> 49:49.587
now, is there?

49:49.687 --> 49:50.921
You'd rather
live in shit

49:51.022 --> 49:53.258
than let the world
see you work a shovel.

49:53.358 --> 49:56.327
You can order warrants,
and I'll serve them.

49:56.427 --> 49:59.630
But as long as I have days
left on those dead wires,

49:59.730 --> 50:02.033
this case goes on.

50:13.378 --> 50:16.347
Yo, look at these Delta
Force, motherfuckers, man.

50:16.447 --> 50:19.117
- I mean, look at them.
- All right.

50:20.718 --> 50:21.919
What's up with Levy?

50:22.019 --> 50:23.554
He said he gonna
meet us down there.

50:23.654 --> 50:26.524
Damn. I still didn't get
this safe outta here yet, man.

50:26.624 --> 50:27.658
How much money
in it?

50:27.758 --> 50:28.959
150.

50:29.060 --> 50:30.628
- 150.
- Yeah.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.197
Well, open it up, man.

50:32.297 --> 50:34.265
No sense in ruining
a good safe.

50:53.084 --> 50:55.320
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

50:55.420 --> 50:58.289
The SWAT guys do love
to break out their
toys, don't they?

50:58.389 --> 50:59.757
They think it's
Tony Montana up there?

50:59.857 --> 51:01.659
These guys probably haven't
touched a gun in years.

51:05.029 --> 51:06.864
Aw, fuck this shit.

51:06.964 --> 51:09.167
You and me,
Lieutenant.

51:13.003 --> 51:15.240
Man:
What units are
in the alley?

51:16.574 --> 51:19.110
Any sight line
to the rear door?

51:19.210 --> 51:21.812
10-four,
who has the roof?

51:23.114 --> 51:24.649
We're going to move in
on my command.

51:25.283 --> 51:28.453
Everyone stand by.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.255
We're not going
to need your men today.
Call 'em back.

51:30.355 --> 51:32.623
- Now, just wait a minute.
- My case, back your men off.

51:36.461 --> 51:38.529
( knocking )

51:48.673 --> 51:51.609
( sighs )

52:30.047 --> 52:32.183
Catch ya later.

52:39.790 --> 52:42.293
( distant sirens )

53:43.588 --> 53:45.990
( sighs )

53:48.526 --> 53:50.295
Good.

53:52.763 --> 53:55.433
Barksdale's
wearing bracelets.

53:56.801 --> 53:59.637
Still no Wee-Bey,
no Little Man?

53:59.737 --> 54:01.939
No, nothing there.

54:12.350 --> 54:14.018
This is the best work
I ever did.

54:14.118 --> 54:16.120
I never did
a case like this.

54:16.220 --> 54:18.122
But it's not enough.

54:18.222 --> 54:21.759
I gotta go back
to auto tomorrow morning

54:21.859 --> 54:24.228
and I just feel like
this just ain't finished.

54:24.329 --> 54:26.564
Detective.

54:54.258 --> 54:57.027
( helicopter hovering )

54:59.330 --> 55:01.932
( children shouting )

55:09.407 --> 55:12.343
( theme music playing )

55:13.305 --> 55:19.653
