WEBVTT

02:02.700 --> 02:04.200
- Oz...

02:04.266 --> 02:05.667
The name on the street

02:05.734 --> 02:08.166
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

02:08.233 --> 02:09.533
level four.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.433
You may have heard
on the news

02:12.500 --> 02:14.100
that we've been having
a little, uh,

02:14.166 --> 02:15.700
tension around here.

02:15.767 --> 02:17.367
Well, after
14 fun-filled days

02:17.433 --> 02:18.667
of sitting
in your cells,

02:18.734 --> 02:20.166
smelling your
roomie's farts,

02:20.233 --> 02:21.834
a man is ready
to forgive everybody

02:21.900 --> 02:23.567
for everything,

02:23.633 --> 02:25.333
just to come up
for air.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.633
- Attention, the following
will step out of their pods:

02:47.700 --> 02:52.233
93A234, Adebisi;

02:52.300 --> 02:57.166
978622, Arif;

02:57.233 --> 03:01.767
97S444, Said;

03:01.834 --> 03:05.333
99P334, Pinkerton;

03:05.400 --> 03:09.500
95B327, Bismilla;

03:09.567 --> 03:13.467
85T612, Tyrell;

03:13.533 --> 03:17.934
95W856, Wolf;

03:18.000 --> 03:22.467
and 88A578, Hamad.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.000
Get in line
behind officer Howard.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.900
- All right, that's it,
move it along.

03:31.967 --> 03:35.166
Let's go. Move it along.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.700
- What the fuck
is going on?

03:36.767 --> 03:39.633
- What do you mean?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.834
- They're taking
all the niggers.

03:48.533 --> 03:50.533
- All right, quiet.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.934
I said, quiet!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.934
Shut up, now!

04:07.633 --> 04:09.066
For the past two weeks,

04:09.133 --> 04:11.667
we have been
in 24-hour lockdown.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.900
Now, I'm not gonna go
into the specifics

04:13.967 --> 04:15.900
as to what caused
this situation.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.100
You know it.

04:18.166 --> 04:22.300
I've brought you together
to say this:

04:22.367 --> 04:28.100
when the lockdown ends
depends on you.

04:28.166 --> 04:31.533
It is my intention
to put this prison

04:31.600 --> 04:33.467
back on a routine
schedule.

04:33.533 --> 04:35.100
But, hear me good.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.633
If there is one
single incident

04:37.700 --> 04:39.400
of race-related violence,

04:39.467 --> 04:42.433
I will lock you
away again,

04:42.500 --> 04:44.600
black and white,

04:44.667 --> 04:46.800
24-7,

04:46.867 --> 04:50.734
for the rest of
your fucking lives.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.834
- See?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.700
All that shit you talk
ain't gonna do nothing.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.600
- Be patient, Kenny,
I have a plan.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.867
- Is Glynn
fucking crazy?

05:11.934 --> 05:13.233
This ain't over.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.166
- I know, the niggers
are up to something.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.767
- And so with
order restored,

05:16.834 --> 05:19.200
warden Leo Glynn
has ended the lockdown.

05:19.266 --> 05:20.467
In a related story,

05:20.533 --> 05:21.900
the wife of
inmate Hamid Khan

05:21.967 --> 05:23.533
has won a state
supreme court ruling

05:23.600 --> 05:25.967
to have her husband
removed from life support.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.734
Khan, who was serving
a 10-year sentence

05:27.800 --> 05:29.233
for aggravated assault,

05:29.300 --> 05:30.967
went into a coma after
being hit in the head

05:31.033 --> 05:32.767
during a prison
boxing match.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.000
- McManus wants
to see you.

05:35.066 --> 05:36.633
- The family's in
with khan now,

05:36.700 --> 05:38.266
saying their
final farewells.

05:38.333 --> 05:41.066
And they've asked that you
say a prayer over the body,

05:41.133 --> 05:42.567
just before the end.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.900
- Bearing in mind

05:43.967 --> 05:45.934
what happened
between Khan and I?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.934
I'm honored they
asked for me.

06:04.734 --> 06:06.500
- With brother Khan gone,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.834
we'll need someone
to lead us.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.834
- I bet I know who
you have in mind.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.000
Yourself.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.166
- Yes.

06:19.233 --> 06:22.266
But, I need
to know, Said.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.400
Will you oppose me?

06:25.467 --> 06:27.233
- No, Arif.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.066
I've lost the taste.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.266
- The taste?

06:31.333 --> 06:33.867
- For power.

06:33.934 --> 06:37.200
I hope you use yours
more wisely than I did.

06:38.367 --> 06:40.066
- Let's go.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.533
- The man I hit,

07:15.600 --> 07:18.567
is he getting better?

07:20.934 --> 07:23.433
- Yeah, he'll be fucking
fine in about 10 minutes.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
Now go to sleep, Cyril,
now.

07:33.367 --> 07:37.200
Oh, Allah, forgive him
and have mercy upon him.

07:37.266 --> 07:40.166
Give him peace
and pardon him.

08:17.934 --> 08:19.100
- What do you want?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.800
You killed me,
Cyril.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.367
- I didn't mean to.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.467
- Then what
about him?

08:28.867 --> 08:30.400
- Who is that?

08:30.467 --> 08:33.433
- It's Preston Nathan,
Gloria's husband.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.166
We're never gonna
leave you, Cyril.

08:37.233 --> 08:40.266
We're gonna be right here
inside your head forever,

08:40.333 --> 08:42.900
for all eternity.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.066
Ahhh!

08:55.133 --> 08:58.600
Cyril, Cyril, shh,
hey, hey, hey!

08:58.667 --> 08:59.867
Wake up!

08:59.934 --> 09:02.266
Shh... Shh.

09:04.734 --> 09:08.066
Shh, it's all right, shh.

09:11.533 --> 09:13.266
- My brother Cyril,
you know,

09:13.333 --> 09:15.033
he keeps on having those
terrible nightmares.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.500
- The valium is not
helping him to sleep?

09:18.567 --> 09:21.233
- No, we gotta try
something else.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.500
- As I said before,

09:22.567 --> 09:25.033
the nightmares are
rooted in his guilt

09:25.100 --> 09:26.433
for causing those deaths.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.900
- Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.133
- And the cure
for your brother

09:31.200 --> 09:32.934
is to alleviate his guilt.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.467
And, in the case
of Hamid Khan,

09:34.533 --> 09:36.633
I'm not even sure
that's possible.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.700
However, with Gloria Nathan's
husband...

09:39.767 --> 09:42.533
- I'll do anything.
Anything.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
- You heard about the
interaction program I started?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.900
Victims and/or
victims' families

09:46.967 --> 09:48.934
sit down with the person
who hurt them and talk.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.433
- Talk about what?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.066
- Their feelings,
their anger, whatever.

09:53.133 --> 09:56.166
And the guilty person
gets a chance

09:56.233 --> 09:58.834
to express remorse.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.467
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.767
Sign Cyril up
for that program.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.467
- Wait a minute,
both of you.

10:06.533 --> 10:07.533
- What?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.000
- I am not about
to ask Gloria

10:09.066 --> 10:10.900
and Preston's parents
to join us

10:10.967 --> 10:13.400
unless you both
participate.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.533
- Hey, I got
no problem with that.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.333
- No, absolutely not.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.033
I can't even be
in the same room

10:24.100 --> 10:25.734
with the O'Reilly
brothers.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.100
It makes
my skin crawl.

10:27.166 --> 10:30.200
- This is a chance
to put the past to rest.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.300
- I could give a shit
about Cyril O'Reilly

10:32.367 --> 10:33.600
sleeping better.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.633
Hell, I'll quadruple
his dosage of valium,

10:35.700 --> 10:36.967
maybe he'll sleep
permanently.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.734
- Gloria, this is not about
Cyril and you know it.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.100
This could give
Preston's mom and dad

10:41.166 --> 10:43.233
a chance
to have closure.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.767
You could
have closure.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.066
- Closure?

10:47.133 --> 10:49.066
People always
think I'm a nurse.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.400
No matter how many times

10:50.467 --> 10:52.734
they hear me referred
to as "Dr. Nathan",

10:52.800 --> 10:54.867
they call out to me,
"hey, nurse."

10:54.934 --> 10:56.333
Now, I don't know
if that's because

10:56.400 --> 10:59.767
I'm a woman or Latina.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.767
Maybe I'm just too goddamned
nice to be a doctor.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.333
- Does this mean
you'll do it?

11:04.400 --> 11:08.400
- It means I'm not taking
shit from anyone anymore.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.600
- Damn!

11:25.233 --> 11:27.300
- Hey, Sister P., hey.

11:27.367 --> 11:28.834
What did
Gloria say?

11:28.900 --> 11:31.567
- She says, no,
Ryan, I'm sorry.

11:31.633 --> 11:34.033
Maybe in time,
she'll change her mind.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.266
- Yeah, but what
about Cyril?

11:37.333 --> 11:40.433
I mean, come on.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.600
- I guess we
increase his dosage.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.734
- What?

12:04.533 --> 12:06.100
- Ahh!

12:07.467 --> 12:09.033
- Ryan!

12:11.266 --> 12:12.467
- What happened?

12:12.533 --> 12:14.133
both: O'Reilly cut himself.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.500
- There you go.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.300
Now, how's that feel?

12:18.367 --> 12:19.834
- Tight.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.934
- You rest here
for a while.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.166
- Yeah.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.033
- You know I asked Said
to tell me about last night,

12:32.100 --> 12:34.667
about Hamid Khan's death.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.934
Said told me that
you wrapped Khan's body

12:37.000 --> 12:38.600
in a clean white cloth

12:38.667 --> 12:40.166
and then added perfume
and prayed.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.834
- O'Reilly, you don't
care about Hamid Khan.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.333
- No, I do,
I don't know.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.700
I just wanted to make
sure the fucking thing

12:45.767 --> 12:48.867
got done right.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.633
Hey, my brother won that fight
fair and square.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.367
- Congratulations,
America.

13:03.433 --> 13:04.734
This year,
the prison population

13:04.800 --> 13:06.700
has reached
an all-time high,

13:06.767 --> 13:08.233
two million.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.433
Two million people are,
what do you call it?

13:10.500 --> 13:11.734
Incarcerated.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.200
Two-fucking-million.

13:13.266 --> 13:14.667
That's the population
of Vienna.

13:14.734 --> 13:17.100
That's the population
of Houston, Texas.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.834
The U.S. Of A
has five percent

13:18.900 --> 13:20.200
of the world's population,

13:20.266 --> 13:22.734
yet it has 25 percent
of the world's prisoners.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.533
Whoopee!

13:26.600 --> 13:28.166
- Bevilaqua.

13:31.266 --> 13:32.967
Alvarez.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.300
Giles.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.700
McCullum.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.133
Fuck me!

13:50.200 --> 13:51.734
Command,
this is C-11.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.333
We have a 74, cell 23.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.967
- What happened?

14:05.033 --> 14:06.367
- Is he dead?

14:06.433 --> 14:07.600
- Yeah, but,
Christ Almighty,

14:07.667 --> 14:09.033
look at his arms
and his legs.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.033
- They're
all chewed up.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.133
- He ate himself.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.400
- That's disgusting.

14:12.467 --> 14:13.633
- Yeah, I'm gonna be
filling out paperwork

14:13.700 --> 14:15.166
for a month.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.266
You goddamn
piece of shit!

14:19.900 --> 14:22.233
- The M.E. Has ruled
McCullum's death as suicide.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.667
He bit into his skin,
chewing off chunks of muscle

14:24.734 --> 14:26.433
over the course
of a week or so,

14:26.500 --> 14:28.300
causing himself
to bleed out.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.100
- Sweet Jesus!

14:30.166 --> 14:31.333
- Like a cannibal.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.033
- A cannibal eats
somebody else's flesh.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.367
- So, what do you call a guy
who eats his own flesh?

14:35.433 --> 14:37.000
- Inventive.

14:37.066 --> 14:38.233
- How he did it

14:38.300 --> 14:40.166
is not as important
as what he did.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.033
This is the third suicide
we've had in solitary

14:42.100 --> 14:43.567
in two years.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.333
- Well, not to mention Alvarez's
almost successful attempt.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.934
- What's your point?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.734
- We've got to do something
about the conditions in there.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.900
- Conditions?

14:49.967 --> 14:51.433
It's solitary,
for Christ's sake!

14:51.500 --> 14:52.867
What do you want
us to do?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.033
Serve high-fucking-tea?

14:54.100 --> 14:55.834
- There's no reason
to talk like that.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.400
No reason for
the attitude.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.367
- I'm sorry, I wish
life in solitary

14:59.433 --> 15:00.767
was all peaceful and rosy

15:00.834 --> 15:02.433
like it is in Emerald City.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.900
But, we get
the dead-enders

15:03.967 --> 15:06.033
you other units
can't handle.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.767
- I agree with Claire.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.433
The only way to deal with
these types of criminals

15:09.500 --> 15:10.967
is to sit on them.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.633
- Well, you got no arguments
out of me, warden, but,

15:12.700 --> 15:14.166
I think there
is a compromise.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.567
- Let's hear it.

15:15.633 --> 15:16.767
- A lot of other maxs,

15:16.834 --> 15:18.066
they give the dinks
in solitary

15:18.133 --> 15:20.066
one hour of rec time
every day or so.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.333
Very controlled.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.567
- That's right.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.000
So, if they get a chance
to walk around,

15:24.066 --> 15:25.500
they have more
incentive to behave.

15:25.567 --> 15:26.834
- It's worth a try.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.633
- As long as it's
my ass on the line,

15:29.700 --> 15:32.500
any of you wanna
volunteer to serve as escort?

15:32.567 --> 15:34.433
Okay, Claire, enough.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.467
Like Gloria says,
it's worth a try.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.400
- Bevilaqua!

16:31.300 --> 16:34.333
- Prisoner number
99B521,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.233
Louis Bevilaqua.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.567
Convicted,
April 2, 1999.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.567
Murder in
the second degree,

16:45.633 --> 16:47.567
illegal possession
of a firearm.

16:47.633 --> 16:50.000
Sentence: 25 years.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.900
Up for parole in 12.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.700
- Hey, Alvarez,

16:54.767 --> 16:56.100
why you in solitary?

16:56.166 --> 16:59.300
- This time, it's for
killing Carlo Ricardo.

16:59.367 --> 17:01.467
- Carlo's dead,
you killed him?

17:01.533 --> 17:04.967
- Well, yeah, I had to,
El Cid sent me.

17:05.033 --> 17:07.600
- Carlo was my cousin.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.567
- You're supposed to be
exercising your legs,

17:09.633 --> 17:12.133
not your mouths,
shut the fuck up.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.200
- Bevilaqua says
he just found out

17:46.266 --> 17:48.400
Alvarez killed Carlo.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.033
Bevilaqua wants
to know, man,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.300
if you want him to finish
the job on Alvarez.

17:52.367 --> 17:55.300
- Tell him, yes.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.400
Tell him I want
him dead already.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.633
- Alvarez!

18:05.734 --> 18:07.667
Bevilaqua.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.000
- Hey, Aqua, man,

18:12.066 --> 18:14.834
I got a funny story
to tell you, bro.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.266
You know, Glynn started
giving me a hassle

18:17.333 --> 18:19.133
about who raped
his daughter,

18:19.200 --> 18:21.600
so, he put me
in solitary.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.500
I told him
Carlo did it.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.066
- Carlo wasn't there.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.867
- Yeah, I know.

18:36.233 --> 18:37.767
What do you think
will happen

18:37.834 --> 18:40.166
when Glynn finds out
you raped his kid?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.767
- Command,
this is C-11.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.700
We need backup in
the gymnasium, now!

18:54.767 --> 18:56.800
I repeat, backup
in the gymnasium!

18:56.867 --> 18:58.200
- Bevilaqua's dead.

18:58.266 --> 18:59.433
- What about Alvarez?

18:59.500 --> 19:00.734
- Intensive care.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.934
- Is he gonna live?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
- Unfortunately.

19:04.066 --> 19:07.867
- I hope this puts
an end to rec time.

19:07.934 --> 19:09.200
- Yeah,

19:09.266 --> 19:11.000
but, I'm also transferring
you to another unit.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.233
- 'Cause
I was right?

19:12.300 --> 19:14.467
- Open the
goddamned door.

19:22.233 --> 19:24.467
- Peter...
Peter Marie.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.600
- Yeah,
that's right.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.233
William, why?

19:30.300 --> 19:34.000
- I, little shaver,
cookie jar,

19:34.066 --> 19:36.934
mama mad,
George Washington,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.767
cherry tree,
chop-chop.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.300
- So, you told
your mother the truth

19:41.367 --> 19:42.834
about stealing the cookies?

19:42.900 --> 19:45.600
- Chocolate chip,
yum-yum.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.934
- But, what has that
got to do with

19:48.000 --> 19:50.200
your attacking
Bevilaqua and Alvarez?

19:50.266 --> 19:51.600
- Liars, liars.

19:51.667 --> 19:54.200
I kill, but, never lie.

19:54.266 --> 19:57.867
Never, ever lie.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.600
- Fucking Alvarez, man,
he's got more lives than a cat!

20:01.667 --> 20:02.867
- Yo, man,
he still alive?

20:02.934 --> 20:04.734
- He's barely,
in the hospital ward.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.333
- Well, you make sure
that fucking scumbag

20:06.400 --> 20:08.867
don't make it out
of there, okay, pendejo?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.300
- This one's for me.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.200
Shit!

20:33.266 --> 20:35.133
- What's up?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.166
Your sons?

20:37.233 --> 20:39.066
- Yeah.

20:39.133 --> 20:41.667
A cousin of
mine sent it.

20:41.734 --> 20:44.066
She heard
about Andrew.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.734
- Hard to get over
losing a kid.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.066
- Makes me miss my other
son, Hank, that much more.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.567
- You haven't heard
from him, right?

20:52.633 --> 20:56.900
- Not since
I came to Oz.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.633
When they're this young,

20:59.700 --> 21:02.367
all you see is
the possibilities.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.133
Let's go.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.967
- Oh, time to renew my
subscription to "TV Guide."

21:19.033 --> 21:21.166
- Hey, Beecher,
this one's for you.

21:23.734 --> 21:25.100
- It's empty.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.066
- Yeah.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.400
We had to confiscate
the contents.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.233
- A letter from
my grandmother?

21:31.300 --> 21:32.667
What could have
possibly been in here

21:32.734 --> 21:34.166
that you had to
confiscate it?

21:34.233 --> 21:37.500
- Well, if I told you,
then you'd know.

21:52.033 --> 21:53.467
- Hello, Tobias.

21:53.533 --> 21:54.734
- Father M.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.166
- Is Pete around?

21:56.233 --> 21:57.834
- Ah, no, she went into town
to see her psychiatrist.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.333
- She's seeing
a psychiatrist?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.900
- Yeah, ever since
she started thinking about

22:00.967 --> 22:02.967
not being a nun,
I thought you knew.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.266
- No.

22:04.333 --> 22:08.734
- Well, it's really
none of my business.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.600
- How are you
doing, Tobias?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.934
- You know.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.934
- Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Any more trouble with
Vernon Schillinger?

22:20.066 --> 22:22.533
- Well, there's always
gonna be trouble,

22:22.600 --> 22:25.100
at least until one of us
ends up in the morgue.

22:25.166 --> 22:27.033
- Oh, now,
I don't believe that.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.800
I know that
the two of you

22:28.867 --> 22:30.500
caused each other
massive amounts of pain

22:30.567 --> 22:31.934
over the years,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.867
but, there's gotta
be a way to call a truce.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.667
- You've got to forgive
Schillinger.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.100
- I tried that and I ended up
bleeding internally.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.233
If it wasn't for Chris Keller,
I'd be dead.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.266
- Well, how did you let him
know that you forgave him?

22:46.333 --> 22:48.567
- What do you mean, how?
I told him to his face.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.433
- Well, maybe this time,
you don't tell him.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.200
Maybe this time,
he just knows.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.700
- So, any ideas?

22:59.767 --> 23:01.367
- You must do something
absolutely extraordinary

23:01.433 --> 23:02.867
for Schillinger,

23:02.934 --> 23:04.800
but, you must never
tell him that you did it.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.367
- Well, then how's
he gonna know?

23:06.433 --> 23:08.800
- All these things have a way
of revealing themselves.

23:08.867 --> 23:10.567
But when Schillinger
does find out,

23:10.633 --> 23:13.066
he'll see your gesture
for exactly what it is.

23:13.133 --> 23:16.533
An act of kindness,
reconciliation.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.900
- This is bullshit.
- Chris.

23:18.967 --> 23:21.333
- No, you're not
going anything.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
You got that?

23:23.467 --> 23:27.500
- What, are you giving
me an order?

23:27.567 --> 23:29.133
- Fuck, yes.

23:36.934 --> 23:38.200
- Hello, Dad.

23:38.266 --> 23:40.000
- Toby...

23:40.066 --> 23:43.800
Oh, god, son,
you look terrific.

23:43.867 --> 23:46.500
- Well, better than the
last time you were here.

23:49.567 --> 23:52.200
- I've put some more money
in your account.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.767
- Thank you.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.500
- There's not much else
I can do, is there?

23:55.567 --> 23:58.100
- Well, actually,
Dad, there is.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.033
One of the
other prisoners,

24:00.100 --> 24:01.734
Vernon Schillinger,

24:01.800 --> 24:03.567
had two sons.

24:03.633 --> 24:06.066
His oldest,
Andrew, was...

24:06.133 --> 24:08.233
died recently.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.567
The other, Hank,

24:10.633 --> 24:12.633
well, Vernon's
lost track of him.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.166
They're estranged.

24:14.233 --> 24:16.967
I was hoping one of
the PIs from the law firm

24:17.033 --> 24:18.467
could do some digging.

24:18.533 --> 24:20.000
- You wanna
locate the boy.

24:20.066 --> 24:21.533
- This is all
the information

24:21.600 --> 24:23.967
I've been able to pull
together so far.

24:26.734 --> 24:28.633
- Mm-hmm.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.633
Well, I'll put
Swanny on this.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.533
He's the best private
investigator we have.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.834
- Thank you, Dad.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.667
- Toby, I'm very
proud of you.

24:36.734 --> 24:38.967
- Proud?

24:39.033 --> 24:41.367
- Well, here you are
living in hell

24:41.433 --> 24:43.133
with your own problems,

24:43.200 --> 24:44.967
and you're trying to
help a fellow inmate

24:45.033 --> 24:49.700
to reunite with his
last surviving son.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.867
You are a remarkable
human being.

24:51.934 --> 24:56.500
- Yeah, I'm remarkable
all right.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.266
- Hey.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.433
How's daddy?

25:12.500 --> 25:13.834
- Good, great.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.066
- You smell sexy.

25:19.133 --> 25:21.200
- It's my father's
aftershave.

25:21.266 --> 25:22.567
- Mm-hmm.

25:22.633 --> 25:24.433
- Hey, don't.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
- What?

25:25.567 --> 25:27.767
- I need to
talk to you.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.467
- So, what's so
fucking important?

25:38.633 --> 25:42.333
- Look, I know
how you'll react.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.433
- Jesus, what?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.700
- I asked my father to locate
Schillinger's other son.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.166
- We discussed this,
yeah, we agreed.

25:53.233 --> 25:55.667
- No, we didn't agree.

25:55.734 --> 25:56.967
- Oh, so, now
all of a sudden,

25:57.033 --> 25:58.400
you wanna help that fuck,
Schillinger, huh?

25:58.467 --> 26:01.533
- No, I wanna help us,
you and me.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.033
I wanna stop living
every fucking day in fear.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.734
- Hey, that's what being
alive is all about, pal.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.133
- It doesn't
have to be.

26:13.100 --> 26:18.433
Chris, sometimes,
most times,

26:18.500 --> 26:21.166
I wish I could
wipe away the past.

26:21.233 --> 26:24.633
I wish I could wipe away
everything I've done,

26:24.700 --> 26:26.967
everything I've said that
hurt the people I love.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.834
I wish I could
look at people

26:28.900 --> 26:30.633
and not see all the
hurt they caused me.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.433
And maybe, maybe
this is the way

26:33.500 --> 26:35.700
to start making
that wish come true.

26:35.767 --> 26:38.200
- Are you listening
to yourself, man?

26:38.266 --> 26:39.834
What are you,
Tinkerbell?

26:39.900 --> 26:42.200
You wishing
upon a star?

26:42.266 --> 26:45.734
- I'm partially responsible for
Andrew Schillinger's death.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.166
I need to
atone for that.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.400
So should you.

26:49.467 --> 26:51.633
- You know what?

26:53.567 --> 26:57.133
Oz didn't make
you a bitch.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.734
You were born one.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.100
- Yeah, okay.

27:07.233 --> 27:08.600
- Shit.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.133
- Come on,
you bitch!

27:16.200 --> 27:17.333
- Hey, who
started it?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.433
- I fucking
started it!

27:18.500 --> 27:20.367
I'm nobody's bitch!

27:20.433 --> 27:22.834
You know what a fucking
bitch, you cunt!

27:22.900 --> 27:24.900
- All right, guys,
break it up.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.133
- I'm nobody's bitch.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.734
- Now, most citizens would say,
"two million inmates?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.133
I got no problem with
that because crime is down."

27:51.200 --> 27:53.400
But, California,

27:53.467 --> 27:55.467
which increased
its prison population

27:55.533 --> 27:57.700
at a much higher rate,
than, say, New York,

27:57.767 --> 28:01.266
had a smaller drop in crime.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.934
Cause and effect?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.767
I don't think so.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.400
- Shirley Bellinger,

28:07.467 --> 28:08.767
who sat on death row
for a year

28:08.834 --> 28:10.300
awaiting execution
for the murder

28:10.367 --> 28:11.867
of her young daughter,

28:11.934 --> 28:13.100
will be returning to Oswald
State

28:13.166 --> 28:14.734
Correctional Facility
today.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.867
Bellinger's death sentence
had been commuted

28:16.934 --> 28:19.367
when she became pregnant
while serving time.

28:19.433 --> 28:22.467
But, after she miscarried
under suspicious circumstances,

28:22.533 --> 28:25.000
Governor Devlin
revoked his decision.

28:38.567 --> 28:40.266
- Here you go, Shirley.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.300
- Well, can't I have
my old cell back?

28:42.367 --> 28:44.233
- As you can see,
it's occupied.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.633
- Well, maybe
he'd switch with me.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.633
Would you
switch with me?

28:48.700 --> 28:51.300
- Sorry, sister,
I'm all spread out.

28:51.367 --> 28:52.667
- I'll make it
worth your while.

28:52.734 --> 28:54.834
- Honey, there's nothing
you've got that I want.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.300
- You'd be surprised.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.467
- Get inside.

29:14.066 --> 29:15.767
- How do you do?

29:15.834 --> 29:17.734
My name's Shirley,
what's yours?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.500
- Suck my dick,
you fucking cunt.

29:20.567 --> 29:23.000
- Well, that's
not polite.

29:23.066 --> 29:25.166
How about you?

29:25.233 --> 29:27.166
You got a kind word
for a stranger?

29:27.233 --> 29:29.500
- Yeah.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.266
Moses Deyell.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.767
- Moses?

29:32.834 --> 29:34.333
Well, maybe you can
lead us out of Egypt

29:34.400 --> 29:35.900
to the promised land.

29:35.967 --> 29:37.867
- I wouldn't
count on it.

29:37.934 --> 29:39.633
- How'd you end up here?

29:42.600 --> 29:46.233
- ♪ Oh, mercy,
mercy me ♪

29:46.300 --> 29:50.200
♪ Oh, things
ain't what they ♪

29:50.266 --> 29:52.967
♪ Used to be ♪

29:53.033 --> 29:55.300
- Ahhh!

29:59.467 --> 30:03.066
- Prisoner number
00D718.

30:04.266 --> 30:06.233
Moses Deyell.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.934
Convicted February 3, 2000,

30:09.000 --> 30:12.033
on two counts of murder
in the first degree.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.533
Sentence: death.

30:15.934 --> 30:17.567
- She was cheatin' on ya?

30:17.633 --> 30:20.033
- Yeah...

30:20.100 --> 30:21.633
With her husband.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.266
- They were married?

30:23.333 --> 30:25.433
- The bitch told me
they was through.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.400
I don't fuck with
another man's wife.

30:27.467 --> 30:28.967
I got principles.

30:29.033 --> 30:30.867
- Oh, I love a man
with principles.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.734
- You know, when I was
first elected governor,

30:38.800 --> 30:40.533
crime was
out of control,

30:40.600 --> 30:42.033
but, we went to work,

30:42.100 --> 30:43.900
fighting for three strikes
and you're out...

30:43.967 --> 30:46.667
- That bastard's running
for another term

30:46.734 --> 30:48.367
after all the crap
he's pulled?

30:48.433 --> 30:49.500
- I'm voting for him.

30:49.567 --> 30:50.633
- What, why?

30:50.700 --> 30:51.800
- Well, things
are better now

30:51.867 --> 30:52.967
than they were
four years ago.

30:53.033 --> 30:54.433
- Better for who?
Not for us.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.166
- Well, in general,

30:56.233 --> 30:58.100
life has improved
across the state

30:58.166 --> 30:59.633
since Devlin
took office.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.900
The economy's up,
crime is down.

31:01.967 --> 31:03.567
- You'd actually vote
for that asshole?

31:03.633 --> 31:04.600
- Yes.

31:04.667 --> 31:05.900
- You can't vote.

31:05.967 --> 31:07.233
You were convicted
of a felony.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.100
You are no longer
eligible to vote.

31:09.166 --> 31:10.266
- Really?

31:10.333 --> 31:11.433
- Really.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
- Oh, well, that's okay.

31:14.567 --> 31:16.266
I never used
to vote anyway.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.200
- Let's finish the job.

31:19.266 --> 31:20.867
The courage to lead.

31:20.934 --> 31:22.467
James Devlin,
governor.

31:22.533 --> 31:23.633
- Welcome.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.100
- Thanks for
seeing me.

31:25.166 --> 31:26.533
- I get a call that

31:26.600 --> 31:28.467
the governor's campaign
manager wants to chat,

31:28.533 --> 31:29.867
I'm intrigued.

31:29.934 --> 31:32.367
Please,
have a seat.

31:32.433 --> 31:35.767
- You'll find that I'm not
the type to dance around.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.600
Frank Feeley won't be
running for re-election

31:37.667 --> 31:39.266
as lieutenant governor.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.266
We haven't announced
this yet to the press,

31:41.333 --> 31:43.500
but, he has cancer,
throat cancer.

31:43.567 --> 31:44.834
- Pity.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.166
- I know.

31:46.233 --> 31:47.800
He was a great draw
for the upstate vote.

31:47.867 --> 31:50.400
Governor Devlin has asked me
to make a short list of people

31:50.467 --> 31:52.734
to replace frank
on the ticket.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.767
I'd like to add
your name to the list.

31:56.233 --> 31:59.300
- Me?
Run with Devlin?

31:59.367 --> 32:00.834
- I know that you
and the governor

32:00.900 --> 32:02.633
have had your
differences in the past,

32:02.700 --> 32:04.467
but, I also know
you're as conservative

32:04.533 --> 32:05.867
as he is
on most issues.

32:05.934 --> 32:07.467
- This wouldn't have
anything to do with

32:07.533 --> 32:10.500
Alvah Case announcing
he's running against Devlin?

32:10.567 --> 32:12.734
- Well, I'll be
honest, sure.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.967
This administration's
reputation

32:15.033 --> 32:18.567
with the African-American
community is a bit tarnished.

32:18.633 --> 32:20.133
But, deeper than that,

32:20.200 --> 32:22.266
I think you'd make a great
lieutenant governor.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.800
- You're offering me this?

32:25.900 --> 32:28.567
- No, you're
on the list.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.767
The convention
is two months away.

32:30.834 --> 32:32.133
Between
now and then,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.033
you'd need to increase
your public profile.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.200
- How?

32:35.266 --> 32:36.967
- Well, that's
what I'm here for,

32:37.033 --> 32:39.200
to walk you
through the steps.

32:39.266 --> 32:40.967
I'm glad you're
interested, Leo.

32:41.033 --> 32:42.667
- I haven't said
that I am.

32:42.734 --> 32:44.200
- Oh, yes, you have.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.333
- Hey, Andrea.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.800
- McManus,

32:49.867 --> 32:51.934
what brings you downtown
from Emerald City?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.467
- Well, have you
seen Diane?

32:53.533 --> 32:54.734
- No.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.100
- Wasn't she due back
from vacation today?

32:56.166 --> 32:57.767
- Yeah, but she didn't
show up for her shift,

32:57.834 --> 32:59.100
so, they asked
me to stay,

32:59.166 --> 33:00.600
which is a royal
pain in my ass

33:00.667 --> 33:02.033
because I think
I got the flu.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.834
- Oh, no, look,
don't breathe on me.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.367
I can't afford
to get sick.

33:05.433 --> 33:06.567
- And I can?

33:06.633 --> 33:07.867
Please,
I got three kids.

33:07.934 --> 33:09.967
My husband's been puking
for the past two days.

33:10.033 --> 33:11.533
- Oh, shit,
well, listen,

33:11.600 --> 33:12.867
if you hear from Diane,

33:12.934 --> 33:14.500
will you please
tell her to call me?

33:14.567 --> 33:15.633
- Sure.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.900
- And feel better.

33:18.266 --> 33:20.767
I've been thinking
or feeling.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.567
I know I've been
all over the place

33:22.633 --> 33:24.100
and back with
this thing,

33:24.166 --> 33:27.433
but, maybe we could
try again together.

33:39.467 --> 33:40.967
- You busy?

33:41.033 --> 33:42.734
- Oh, no, no, no,
come on in.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
What's
the problem?

33:43.867 --> 33:45.100
- No problem.

33:45.166 --> 33:48.633
Hey, I just got off
the phone with Diane.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.300
- Where is she?

33:50.367 --> 33:52.233
- Well, she's
still in London.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.767
- I just called
her hotel.

33:53.834 --> 33:54.800
They said
she checked out.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.066
- Yeah...

33:56.133 --> 33:57.934
- No, her two
weeks are up.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.767
She was supposed to
come back to work today.

34:00.834 --> 34:02.233
What's she still
doing in London?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.166
- Well, you know,
she and Dee-Dee

34:04.233 --> 34:07.166
were standing in front
of Buckingham Palace

34:07.233 --> 34:11.133
and she got into
a conversation with

34:11.200 --> 34:12.734
a guard.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.934
- I thought
they didn't talk.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.734
- He was on break.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.133
Anyway,

34:17.200 --> 34:20.266
one thing led
to another,

34:20.333 --> 34:21.767
and...

34:23.834 --> 34:25.834
They're going
to get married.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.633
Right.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.000
- I'm serious.

34:40.767 --> 34:42.166
- She's getting
married?

34:42.233 --> 34:44.133
- Yeah.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.533
- To a bobby?

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
- No, no, not a bobby,
Tim; he's a guard.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.333
He guards the queen.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.633
- Yeah, well,
then I can see

34:51.700 --> 34:54.066
how they've got a lot
in fucking common!

34:54.133 --> 34:56.066
Oh, fuck!

35:02.834 --> 35:05.934
Jesus-fucking-Christ!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.467
Did she leave
a number?

35:07.533 --> 35:09.133
- She doesn't want
to talk to you.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.600
- Well, I got a helluva lot
I wanna say to her!

35:10.667 --> 35:13.066
- Which is why she doesn't
wanna talk to you.

35:13.133 --> 35:14.367
She really
feels very badly.

35:14.433 --> 35:16.367
- Oh, really?

35:16.433 --> 35:18.367
- Now, listen, Tim.

35:18.433 --> 35:21.633
Diane Whittlesey has
not had an easy life.

35:21.700 --> 35:26.100
Poverty, spousal abuse,
single motherhood,

35:26.166 --> 35:28.467
her mom dying after
a very long illness.

35:28.533 --> 35:30.066
And just now,
on the phone,

35:30.133 --> 35:33.600
her voice,
she sounded so happy.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.400
- Happy?

35:38.834 --> 35:40.767
Sure.

35:49.934 --> 35:51.900
- If you need
to talk...

35:51.967 --> 35:54.800
- What I need
is a drink.

35:57.700 --> 36:00.133
- Tim.
- Don't worry, sister.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.900
This is what guys
who've been dumped do

36:01.967 --> 36:04.467
in order to move on.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.066
Cheerio.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.934
- Adebisi, you
still got the gun?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.567
- Lower your voice.

36:21.533 --> 36:22.734
- You still got it?

36:22.800 --> 36:23.834
- Yes.

36:23.900 --> 36:25.033
- And when you
gonna use it?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.500
- I'm not.

36:26.567 --> 36:28.266
- Then what the fuck is
the point of having a gun

36:28.333 --> 36:30.300
if you don't
use the shit?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.300
- If I use the gun,

36:34.367 --> 36:36.934
I end up in the hole,
solitary or death row.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.967
No, our goal was to get
rid of McManus, remember?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.433
To have a black man
running Emerald City.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.100
- Yeah, like you can
make that happen?

36:47.166 --> 36:51.867
- I can, depending on
who I get to shoot the gun,

36:51.934 --> 36:54.033
and who gets shot.

36:54.100 --> 36:57.033
- I don't understand, man.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.300
- Of course
you don't, Kenny.

36:59.367 --> 37:02.567
Of course you don't.

37:02.633 --> 37:05.100
- All right, time to go
back to your cages.

37:05.166 --> 37:07.200
Line up!

37:07.266 --> 37:08.900
- Andrew said you was gonna get
me, Poet, and Pierce

37:08.967 --> 37:10.800
sent back to Em City,
what's up with that?

37:10.867 --> 37:11.800
- I will.

37:11.867 --> 37:13.233
- When?

37:13.300 --> 37:16.367
- Patience, Kenny,
patience.

37:16.433 --> 37:18.367
- Fuck patience, man,

37:18.433 --> 37:20.567
That's all you ever
say, is patience!

37:20.633 --> 37:22.266
Patience!

37:22.333 --> 37:24.867
I've got too much time in
this motherfucker to be patient!

37:24.934 --> 37:26.567
- No, I won't do it.

37:26.633 --> 37:28.100
- Why?

37:28.166 --> 37:29.934
- Look, Wangler accused me
of sexually harassing him.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.400
I don't want him
anywhere near me.

37:31.467 --> 37:34.967
- Wangler admitted
he exaggerated his claim.

37:35.033 --> 37:36.834
- Exaggerated?

37:36.900 --> 37:39.033
- Look, Tim,

37:39.100 --> 37:42.433
Adebisi came to me
requesting that Wangler,

37:42.500 --> 37:44.333
Poet and pierce get transferred
back to your unit.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.000
Now, I'm trying to put
a lid on the racial tension.

37:47.066 --> 37:49.066
And if giving Adebisi
this one small thing

37:49.133 --> 37:50.300
helps do that,

37:50.367 --> 37:52.633
I don't see what
your problem is.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.700
If you say no,
I'll transfer him anyway.

37:57.767 --> 37:59.367
- Fine.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.166
- What's up?

38:23.233 --> 38:25.600
Same old shit.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.266
What's up, baby?

38:32.300 --> 38:33.533
- Welcome home.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.200
- Yo, let me
see the gun.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.367
Let me see the gun.

38:57.033 --> 38:58.734
Damn.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.166
Let me hold it.

39:00.233 --> 39:02.066
Let me hold
that piece.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.166
- Come and get it.

39:07.967 --> 39:09.600
- You three have been
chosen to do your time

39:09.667 --> 39:11.867
in an experimental unit
we call Emerald City.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.400
In Emerald City,

39:13.467 --> 39:15.633
you're given a lot more
leeway than the rest of Oz,

39:15.700 --> 39:17.300
but, the leeway
has a price.

39:17.367 --> 39:18.834
We've got rules.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.500
There's no yelling,
no fighting, no fucking.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.367
You're expected
to keep yourselves

39:23.433 --> 39:25.800
and the common areas
pristine.

39:25.867 --> 39:28.033
You obey the rules,
we get along fine.

39:28.100 --> 39:31.066
You don't, we drop-kick
your ass to 'gen pop.

39:31.133 --> 39:32.967
Now, these guys,

39:33.033 --> 39:35.600
these guys are gonna
be your sponsors,

39:35.667 --> 39:38.166
help you acclimate
to your new life.

39:38.233 --> 39:40.333
Augustus hill,
that's Desmond Mobay.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.300
Chuckie Pancamo,
that's Ralph Galino.

39:43.367 --> 39:47.700
And Gilliam Tarrant,
that's Jazz Hoyt.

39:47.767 --> 39:49.934
- You've gotta be
kidding me, man.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.333
- Yo, peep them shoes
right there.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.300
- Where you from,
man, Jamaica?

40:05.367 --> 40:07.433
- Yes.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.900
- How long you
been in the states?

40:09.967 --> 40:11.667
- Six months.

40:11.734 --> 40:13.967
- What got you
sucked into Oz?

40:17.934 --> 40:19.900
- Are you writing
my life story?

40:24.200 --> 40:25.533
- I don't know you.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.567
- It's like the man said,
my name is Ralph Galino.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.133
- I don't know you or where
the fuck you came from.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.667
- Well, I'm
a contractor.

40:31.734 --> 40:34.066
I built a housing complex
that collapsed,

40:34.133 --> 40:35.367
it killed two people.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.200
But, it wasn't my fault.

40:37.266 --> 40:38.867
- So, you're
not connected.

40:38.934 --> 40:40.667
- Connected?
You mean...

40:40.734 --> 40:42.100
- Yeah, anybody got
their arm around you?

40:42.166 --> 40:43.233
- Oh, god, no.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.500
Until this
little brouhaha,

40:44.567 --> 40:45.934
I never even gotten
a parking ticket.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.200
- Oh, yeah?

40:47.266 --> 40:48.633
- No offense, Mr. Pancamo,

40:48.700 --> 40:50.266
but not every Italian-American
is mobbed up.

40:50.333 --> 40:51.767
- Is that so?

40:51.834 --> 40:53.700
- Yeah, most of us live normal,
law-abiding lives.

40:53.767 --> 40:57.000
The Guido gangster is an
ugly and unfair stereotype.

40:57.066 --> 40:59.333
- So, who is he?

40:59.400 --> 41:02.200
- Just another
fucking asshole.

41:02.266 --> 41:04.266
- Yo!

41:04.333 --> 41:06.967
- You got money?

41:07.033 --> 41:08.633
Gimme it.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.300
Fuckin' pussy.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.200
- Everybody in Oz
has a job,

41:20.266 --> 41:22.667
which can range from
maintenance to food service,

41:22.734 --> 41:23.700
to machinery.

41:23.767 --> 41:26.133
You have
secretarial skills,

41:26.200 --> 41:28.567
so the warden has requested
that you work in his office.

41:28.633 --> 41:30.433
- Okay.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.533
- You also have a history
of drug abuse.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.533
- History.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.667
I'm done
with drugs.

41:36.734 --> 41:38.166
- Uh-huh, just in case,

41:38.233 --> 41:40.400
I'm gonna have you take
part in our rehab sessions,

41:40.467 --> 41:42.467
at least for
a few weeks.

41:42.533 --> 41:44.133
You keep
your nose clean,

41:44.200 --> 41:46.066
both figuratively
and literally,

41:46.133 --> 41:48.033
and we'll get along.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.400
Go see the warden.

41:52.100 --> 41:53.533
Next!

42:00.467 --> 42:01.900
- Yeah.

42:04.433 --> 42:06.800
- Warden, this
is Desmond Mobay.

42:06.867 --> 42:08.800
- Okay, you can leave
him, Armstrong.

42:08.867 --> 42:10.867
- Yes, sir.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.667
- Detective Basil.

42:15.734 --> 42:16.967
- Hello, warden.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.967
- Have a seat.

42:19.033 --> 42:20.633
- Nice little prison
you run here.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.166
- Little?

42:22.233 --> 42:24.433
Oz is the largest correctional
facility in the state.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.934
- And, yet, the place feels
so intimate, so friendly.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.266
- Now, I have
to tell you

42:28.333 --> 42:30.533
the drug problem here
is substantial, but,

42:30.600 --> 42:32.066
I'm not sure
how effective

42:32.133 --> 42:33.734
an undercover
operation will be.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.133
Several years ago,

42:35.200 --> 42:37.033
we had another narcotics
detective come in.

42:37.100 --> 42:38.567
- Paul Markstrom.
- Yeah.

42:38.633 --> 42:40.000
- I knew Paul;
he was a good man.

42:40.066 --> 42:41.600
- Then you also know
he was executed,

42:41.667 --> 42:43.567
hung by the neck.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.767
- Those are
the risks.

42:45.834 --> 42:48.934
- Well, I intend to keep
a close eye on you.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.333
That's why I wanted you
working here in the office.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.367
I want to be
updated constantly.

42:53.433 --> 42:55.000
- No problem.

42:55.066 --> 42:58.600
- All right, let me
show you your desk.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.133
The place might
be a mess.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.667
My last secretary left
in kind of a hurry.

43:02.734 --> 43:04.633
- Very nice.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.433
I can use this to
e-mail my lieutenant,

43:06.500 --> 43:07.667
my partner.

43:07.734 --> 43:10.233
By the way, I type
85 words a minute.

43:10.300 --> 43:12.467
- Shit, I might hire you
as my secretary for real.

43:12.533 --> 43:15.600
- If I don't make this bust,
I'll need the job.

43:15.667 --> 43:18.033
My lieutenant,
he wants results.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.533
- What's your
first step?

43:20.600 --> 43:23.834
-  Making good
friends with the bad guys.

43:29.233 --> 43:32.033
Yo, man,
how's it going?

43:32.100 --> 43:34.433
Some cultural
reading, eh?

43:36.100 --> 43:37.600
- What, all
of a sudden,

43:37.667 --> 43:39.934
you wanna be
my yaga-yaga?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.433
- I stray wronged.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.633
People say
you're cool.

43:42.700 --> 43:43.867
- Do they?

43:43.934 --> 43:45.367
- They also say

43:45.433 --> 43:47.133
you know where a man
can get some relief.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.800
- Some relief
or some reefer?

43:48.867 --> 43:50.633
- Same thing.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.266
Though I could use
something stronger.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.600
- Well, whoever
you jawing with,

43:55.667 --> 43:59.934
they misinformed,
I don't do drugs.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.333
- No?
- No, not no more, no.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.200
- Oh.

44:05.266 --> 44:08.500
So, who do
I talk to?

44:08.567 --> 44:11.900
- Just stand still,
they'll come to you.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.266
- Hi, honey, it's me.

45:18.333 --> 45:19.867
How am I doing?

45:19.934 --> 45:22.500
How the fuck do you
think I'm doing?

45:22.567 --> 45:24.266
Listen,
call Dan Bosey,

45:24.333 --> 45:25.934
tell him to get
his ass in gear.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.867
I want that appeal
signed and sealed.

45:27.934 --> 45:30.367
I've gotta
get out of here.

45:32.967 --> 45:35.266
I love you, too, babe.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.600
All right, bye.

45:39.367 --> 45:40.533
What do you want?

45:40.600 --> 45:42.400
- Permit me to
introduce myself.

45:42.467 --> 45:44.400
Nikolia Petrovic Stanislofsky.

45:44.467 --> 45:46.133
- Okay, what
do you want?

45:46.200 --> 45:47.734
- That cell phone.

45:47.800 --> 45:50.200
How did you
get it into Oz?

45:50.266 --> 45:51.900
- My brother brought
it to me, why?

45:51.967 --> 45:53.967
- They're not
allowed.

45:54.033 --> 45:55.433
- Really, no one
mentioned that.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.100
- The prison,

45:57.166 --> 45:58.467
they want us to use
the pay phones,

45:58.533 --> 46:00.834
first, because they
monitor calls randomly,

46:00.900 --> 46:02.333
and second,

46:02.400 --> 46:04.700
because the state gets
a cut from the phone company

46:04.767 --> 46:06.834
of all the long-distance
calls we make.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.567
- Shit, I guess
I better turn it in.

46:08.633 --> 46:10.867
I don't need any more trouble
than I already got.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.166
- You know,
if you like,

46:12.233 --> 46:13.767
I will take care
of it for you.

46:13.834 --> 46:16.700
I can say I found
a cell phone

46:16.767 --> 46:18.600
and no one will
be the wiser.

46:20.667 --> 46:22.967
It's up to you.

46:23.033 --> 46:24.900
- Thank you.

46:24.967 --> 46:26.900
What's your name?

46:26.967 --> 46:28.300
- Nikolia.

46:28.367 --> 46:29.533
- Ralph.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.033
I owe you one.

46:31.100 --> 46:32.500
- No, no problem.

46:32.567 --> 46:34.734
Better take
the charger, too.

47:11.500 --> 47:16.633
- Prisoner number 00T416,
Guillaum Tarrant.

47:21.066 --> 47:24.133
Convicted
January 2, 2000.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.000
Destruction of
private property,

47:26.066 --> 47:27.867
concealment of
a deadly weapon.

47:27.934 --> 47:31.734
Sentence, 10 years,
up for parole in three.

47:35.467 --> 47:37.934
- Yo, what's up, yo?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.266
Welcome to Em City.

47:40.333 --> 47:42.667
Nice shoes.

47:42.734 --> 47:44.166
Your mother
give you those

47:44.233 --> 47:46.166
before they shipped you
off to summer camp and shit?

47:46.233 --> 47:48.200
- Leave me alone.

47:48.266 --> 47:49.400
- What kind of
accent is that?

47:49.467 --> 47:52.066
Where you from?
- Leave me alone.

47:52.133 --> 47:54.000
- Yo, man, I'm just trying
to start a conversation, dog.

47:54.066 --> 47:55.834
I'm just being
friendly and shit.

47:58.266 --> 48:00.333
- Where you going?

48:00.400 --> 48:01.767
Huh, where
you going?

48:01.834 --> 48:07.867
- Yo, just sit your ugly
white ass back down.

48:07.934 --> 48:08.867
- Check this.

48:08.934 --> 48:11.200
Your shoes,
offer 'em to me.

48:11.266 --> 48:12.767
- What?

48:12.834 --> 48:14.300
- Offer 'em to me.

48:14.367 --> 48:16.200
- Do it.

48:16.266 --> 48:19.767
- Would you
take my shoes?

48:19.834 --> 48:22.000
- Louder.

48:22.066 --> 48:24.166
- Would you
take my shoes?

48:24.233 --> 48:27.300
- Louder, motherfucker,
louder, louder...

48:27.367 --> 48:29.867
- Take my shoes,
please!

48:29.934 --> 48:31.567
- Oh, damn, cool,
a gift for me.

48:31.633 --> 48:32.667
Word, hey.

48:32.734 --> 48:34.500
Let me take
these shoes.

48:34.567 --> 48:38.433
Let me see these,
oh, these the real deal.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.300
My size and everything,
hook me up.

48:41.367 --> 48:44.100
Yo, real...
Thank you.

48:44.166 --> 48:46.433
All right, damn,
good looking, cuz.

48:46.500 --> 48:48.233
My love,
appreciate it,

48:48.300 --> 48:50.133
see ya,
all right?

48:59.333 --> 49:02.033
- And then
they took them.

49:04.233 --> 49:05.967
- Here you go,
blow your nose.

49:08.900 --> 49:12.000
Guillaum,
here's the problem.

49:12.066 --> 49:14.200
If I go to Wangler and tell
him what you just told me,

49:14.266 --> 49:15.667
he's gonna deny it.

49:15.734 --> 49:17.100
His word
against yours.

49:17.166 --> 49:18.834
Well, he's got Poet
and Pierce to back him up.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.333
What you need is
evidence or a witness.

49:21.400 --> 49:25.700
- He's wearing the shoes,
that's evidence.

49:25.767 --> 49:27.233
- But, then you have
to find somebody

49:27.300 --> 49:29.934
that says that they saw you
wearing the shoes earlier.

49:30.033 --> 49:31.600
Can you do that?

49:31.667 --> 49:33.467
- No.

49:33.533 --> 49:35.467
- See, any witness I find
is gonna say that

49:35.533 --> 49:38.667
they heard you offer
the shoes to Wangler.

49:38.734 --> 49:41.700
- So, what do I do now?

49:41.767 --> 49:43.400
- Call your family.

49:43.467 --> 49:45.900
Have them send you
another pair of shoes.

49:45.967 --> 49:48.500
- Wangler will just
steal those, too.

49:48.567 --> 49:50.700
- Probably.

49:50.767 --> 49:54.000
Look, ummm...

49:54.066 --> 49:57.400
I don't like those
three being around here

49:57.467 --> 49:59.266
any more than you do.

49:59.333 --> 50:02.367
So, if you ever see or
hear anything I can use

50:02.433 --> 50:04.000
to hang their
balls out to dry,

50:04.066 --> 50:05.333
let me know.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.533
And in the meantime,
go to the infirmary,

50:07.600 --> 50:09.100
tell them I sent you,

50:09.166 --> 50:12.166
get a pair of slippers that
will tide you over until...

50:22.633 --> 50:24.734
- Yo, Frenchy!

50:24.800 --> 50:26.367
How about a game
of one-on-one?

50:26.433 --> 50:27.734
Me and you.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.667
- No, thanks.

50:29.734 --> 50:31.367
- I'm not asking.

50:56.967 --> 50:58.967
- That's why we say it
like that, baby.

51:01.433 --> 51:02.900
- It must be
the shoes, baby.

51:02.967 --> 51:04.300
Both: It must be the shoes.

51:04.367 --> 51:06.266
- Good game.

51:13.033 --> 51:15.166
- Hey, McManus.

51:15.233 --> 51:17.133
- I got no time for you
today, O'Reilly.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.600
- Hey, you ought to transfer
Frenchy out of Em City, man.

51:19.667 --> 51:21.266
- Hey, since when
do you tell me

51:21.333 --> 51:22.633
who lives here
and who doesn't?

51:22.700 --> 51:25.300
- You don't do something,
there's gonna be trouble.

51:25.367 --> 51:27.967
- Yeah, thank you
for the advice.

51:37.967 --> 51:39.834
Hey...

51:39.900 --> 51:42.800
Oh, man.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.066
I heard what those
niggers did to you.

51:45.133 --> 51:47.200
- Go away.

51:47.266 --> 51:50.300
- Hey, this
is for you.

51:50.367 --> 51:52.467
- Marijuana?

51:52.533 --> 51:54.000
- Yeah, plus a little
something extra

51:54.066 --> 51:55.500
we call a "duster."

51:55.567 --> 51:58.000
Oh, no, why don't you
wait a few minutes?

51:58.066 --> 51:59.300
If the hacks see you,

51:59.367 --> 52:01.233
they're gonna eat
your ass for lunch,

52:01.300 --> 52:02.967
so, all right?

52:03.033 --> 52:07.300
Look, life in Oz,
it sucks.

52:07.367 --> 52:09.233
The only way
for you to survive

52:09.300 --> 52:11.800
is to teach Wangler
and his crew

52:11.867 --> 52:14.333
that they can't bully you
around like this.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.734
- How, how do I do that?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.934
- Well, I don't know.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.567
But, if an opportunity
presents itself, grab it,

52:24.633 --> 52:26.967
because you're not
gonna get a second chance.

53:03.133 --> 53:05.867
- The scariest part is,
all those criminals

53:05.934 --> 53:08.166
that were locked into all
those prisons in the '80s,

53:08.233 --> 53:10.367
you know, the good,
old Reagan years,

53:10.433 --> 53:14.033
all those criminals,
their sentences are up.

53:14.100 --> 53:16.900
Those bad men who
are more dangerous now

53:16.967 --> 53:19.033
than when they went in,

53:19.100 --> 53:21.100
they're getting out.

53:21.166 --> 53:24.000
And coming to darken
street corners near you.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.734
- Lights out!

54:07.266 --> 54:09.033
- Beecher.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.633
- Who are you?

54:13.700 --> 54:15.867
- Tarrant,
Guillaum Tarrant.

54:15.934 --> 54:18.000
- You the guy who
destroyed that statue?

54:18.066 --> 54:19.567
- Oui.

54:19.633 --> 54:22.734
- Fucking-sicko-bastard.

54:31.667 --> 54:33.166
- Damn, your mom
work quick.

54:33.233 --> 54:35.066
She send your
shit air mail?

54:35.133 --> 54:36.667
- Get the fuck
away from me.

54:36.734 --> 54:37.800
- Tough talk.

54:37.867 --> 54:38.834
- You know
you shouldn't swear,

54:38.900 --> 54:40.033
your mama'd
be PO'd.

54:40.100 --> 54:41.700
- I'm warning you
to back off.

54:41.767 --> 54:43.533
- What the fuck, son?
You trying to get tough now?

54:43.600 --> 54:45.066
Huh?

54:45.133 --> 54:46.567
What the fuck
you gonna do, huh?

54:46.633 --> 54:48.433
Huh, huh?

55:04.867 --> 55:07.100
- Stay down, stay down...

55:16.600 --> 55:19.967
- Ow, godammit!

55:20.033 --> 55:21.834
- Chris!

55:21.900 --> 55:23.333
- Ahhh!

56:14.300 --> 56:16.800
- Come on,
put the gun down.

56:16.867 --> 56:20.700
There's no way out,
put the gun down.

56:20.767 --> 56:22.333
There's no way out.
