01:41.183 --> 01:44.145
You can put those away.
They will sleep for hours.

01:44.228 --> 01:46.022
But I won't.

02:34.278 --> 02:36.364
- What did he want?
- I'm not sure.

02:42.536 --> 02:44.538
But it appears he left us a present.

02:46.540 --> 02:47.958
He's moving toward the airfield.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.045
That autogyro he's using
isn't a long-range craft.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.006
He must be planning on rendezvousing
with a bigger plane.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.136
- There.
- "Lazarus."

02:59.345 --> 03:01.889
It's too easy. He wants us to find him.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.599
Let's check this out.

03:05.267 --> 03:08.813
<i>[anticipated meeting you
tonight, Detective.</i>

03:09.355 --> 03:13.734
<i>I hope the story I have to tell you may
cause you to reconsider your pursuit.</i>

03:14.735 --> 03:17.196
<i>The year was 1883.</i>

03:17.488 --> 03:20.866
<i>Your government
was ruthlessly expanding westward.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:12.710
What will it be, stranger?

04:14.170 --> 04:16.422
Water, ma'am, in a clean glass.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.552
Horse done give out on me 10 miles back,

04:21.719 --> 04:24.638
and I'm hotter than
a shaved coyote with a heat rash.

04:24.722 --> 04:28.434
Another thing, ma'am.
You by any chance seen this feller?

04:30.978 --> 04:32.104
You a bounty hunter?

04:32.271 --> 04:34.273
Just to pay for my piano lessons.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.484
I know that two-bit skunk.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.694
He hurt one of my girls real bad.

04:38.861 --> 04:42.239
If you could point me in his
general direction, I'd appreciate it.

04:43.532 --> 04:46.911
That I can and will.
And this one's on the house.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.081
Well, well.

04:51.248 --> 04:53.626
Jonah Hex, his own bad self.

04:53.709 --> 04:57.713
Been here five minutes and you ain't
killed nobody nor set nothing on fire.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.507
Slipping, ain't you?

04:59.673 --> 05:01.342
I'm still a little bushed.

05:01.884 --> 05:07.306
Fact is, you look a little past it, Hex.
Not tired, just all used up.

05:07.556 --> 05:09.725
Well, if I get pushed,

05:09.892 --> 05:12.686
I can still shoot a fly out
from between its wings,

05:12.853 --> 05:14.772
provided the light's right, of course.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.858
And it's a big, plump fly.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.283
I ain't got nothing on you, Hex. Yet.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.954
Just remember them wanted posters say,
"Dead or alive."

05:30.663 --> 05:33.290
You might try "alive" this time.

05:33.749 --> 05:35.459
First time for everything.

05:39.713 --> 05:42.550
Be back here around midnight.
I can help you then.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.354
Duvall comes into town now and then,
starts fights, bothers my girls,

05:55.521 --> 05:57.314
challenges men to duels.

05:57.439 --> 05:59.149
I'm aware of his habits, missy.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.318
What I ain't aware of is
where he's holed up.

06:01.735 --> 06:03.028
Strange thing, that.

06:03.195 --> 06:06.448
He ain't staying at the hotel,
and the next town's 50 miles away.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.119
Sounds like he likes to sleep on
the ground with the rest of the snakes.

06:10.202 --> 06:13.414
He ain't the type.
More the clean-sheet sort.

06:13.497 --> 06:14.915
And he first showed up in town

06:14.999 --> 06:17.710
about the time folks started seeing
the sky monster.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.044
The what?

06:19.211 --> 06:20.671
No one knows what it is,

06:20.754 --> 06:23.591
and the sheriff's too yellow
to investigate.

06:24.133 --> 06:28.095
It only comes out at night,
like a big boat or a log in the sky.

06:28.178 --> 06:30.472
About the same time it showed,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.433
folks started seeing lights in the-

06:33.225 --> 06:34.268
Get down.

06:38.355 --> 06:43.694
Way I figure, that glow might some way
tie in with the sky monster and Duvall.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.571
Reckon so.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.532
I think you'd better
start back now, missy.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.827
Got a feeling things might get loud
and busy soon.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.749
Good luck, Jonah Hex.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.084
Right nice sentiment, ma'am.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.881
But I never cottoned much to luck.
I like to make my own.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.259
I'II remember that when I see you next.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.458
All right, hurry up
with that crane up there.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.547
All right, a little lower,
a little lower.

08:17.913 --> 08:19.873
Work, you lazy good-for-nothing!

08:22.876 --> 08:26.630
I've told you repeatedly,
this is not how I do things!

08:27.172 --> 08:28.882
I beg your pardon, sir.

08:29.049 --> 08:32.261
I was hoping to expedite
the completion of the airship.

08:32.428 --> 08:37.099
Commendable, but not at the expense
of my workforce.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.310
Good men are hard to find
in these parts,

08:40.394 --> 08:42.021
and there is still much to be done.

08:42.187 --> 08:45.315
The government's western expansion
is destroying this land.

08:45.482 --> 08:48.777
Drastic steps must be taken
to preserve the wilderness.

08:48.944 --> 08:52.114
And Ra's al Ghul is the one to do it.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.366
Who better than I?

08:54.742 --> 08:57.953
I'II destroy the railroad and bomb
other railroad junctions

08:58.037 --> 09:00.622
as I move eastward toward Washington.

09:00.789 --> 09:02.416
Once Washington is in flames,

09:02.499 --> 09:04.710
I'II force the United States government

09:04.877 --> 09:08.088
to declare me master of America!

09:10.382 --> 09:11.884
Whatever you say.

09:27.816 --> 09:31.028
It would appear we have ourselves
a government spy.

09:32.362 --> 09:35.365
A rather disreputable-looking one
at that.

09:35.532 --> 09:37.409
Well, Mr. Spy,

09:37.743 --> 09:41.872
I'd say your plan has failed
and the railroad is doomed.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.874
I ain't no spy.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.753
I'm Jonah Hex, and I don't give
a tinker's cuss about no railroad.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.964
I've come to get you, Arkady Duvall,

09:51.590 --> 09:54.259
on account of what you done
to that girl back east.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.428
You mean to say

09:56.595 --> 10:00.307
you've tracked me
across 12 states because of that?

10:00.390 --> 10:03.977
Well, there's also the matter
of a $200 reward.

10:04.394 --> 10:06.355
That part don't hurt my feelings none.

10:06.438 --> 10:09.274
You're either a liar or a fool.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.485
I've been known to be foolish,

10:11.819 --> 10:14.655
but ain't nobody calls me a liar
and goes to bed happy.

10:16.031 --> 10:17.699
Give him a lead bath.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.050
Perhaps we can make both sides match.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.301
Stop!

10:37.010 --> 10:39.096
You are becoming quite bold, Arkady.

10:39.179 --> 10:43.267
Whipping my men, disposing
of interlopers without consulting me.

10:43.433 --> 10:46.311
He's a spy, sir, a railroad spy.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.649
He looks more like a saddle burn to me.

10:50.732 --> 10:53.235
Imprison him. I will question him later.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.574
And you, Arkady, will make no more
decisions without my approval.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.825
Understood?

11:40.616 --> 11:41.783
What?

12:29.331 --> 12:32.709
Today on this momentous period
in history,

12:32.876 --> 12:35.754
we link our great western lands
with the east.

12:35.837 --> 12:41.051
Before this great enterprise,
envisioned by myself,

12:41.218 --> 12:43.428
there was nothing here but wilderness.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.556
And from it, with bare hands,

12:46.723 --> 12:49.393
hard work and dedication,

12:49.851 --> 12:53.188
we have hewn a civilized land.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.407
And so it gives me great pleasure
as the territorial governor

13:03.490 --> 13:05.867
to drive the golden spike
which will connect

13:05.951 --> 13:09.037
these two great sections
of the North American continent.

13:31.935 --> 13:34.563
<i>Run, if you value your lives!</i>

13:37.107 --> 13:40.444
Clear the area! Maintain at your peril!

14:01.381 --> 14:02.507
Fire!

14:57.437 --> 14:59.439
Run for your lives!

15:19.709 --> 15:21.336
Don't shoot, you fool!

15:21.420 --> 15:23.213
This ship is full of hydrogen gas!

15:23.505 --> 15:25.173
Do you want to blow us all to atoms?

15:52.576 --> 15:54.494
You! I don't believe it!

15:54.995 --> 15:56.913
Guess I'm just a bad penny.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.332
Why are you doing this?

15:59.499 --> 16:02.377
Because I don't like you or your kind.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.671
Excuse me.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.842
No! The hydrogen cells!

16:15.932 --> 16:17.893
What happened?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.687
It was that scarred man.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.647
He turned our own cannons on us.

16:30.238 --> 16:33.158
Now, let's you and me dance.

16:33.950 --> 16:36.119
You cannot defeat me.

16:36.244 --> 16:38.955
I am a Heidelberg fencing champion.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.166
My heart's all aflutter.

16:52.135 --> 16:54.179
I'II chop you to pieces.

16:55.263 --> 16:56.973
Talk, talk, talk.

17:08.401 --> 17:10.445
Order the men to abandon ship.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.656
Aye, sir. But what about Duvall?

17:12.739 --> 17:14.783
Leave that fool to his fate.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.221
5000 in gold.
Take it. Leave me be.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.640
It ain't about money, boy.

18:20.807 --> 18:24.352
It's about justice,
and I aim to serve you some.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.563
Let me live. Please.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.899
I will, only because
it's too much trouble

18:29.983 --> 18:32.277
to haul your stinking carcass back east.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.454
I'm getting too old for this.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.921
Great story. But what's it got to do
with that rest home?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.882
I think I know.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.733
I assume you listened
to my account, Detective.

19:11.816 --> 19:12.942
Yes.

19:16.404 --> 19:17.489
Duvall.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.200
It can't be. He'd be over 100 years old.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.703
He was sentenced to 50 years
of hard labor.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.539
Of course, no one expected him
to live out that sentence.

19:27.248 --> 19:28.333
No one but me.

19:28.416 --> 19:29.959
The Lazarus pit.

19:30.293 --> 19:31.878
When he was a young man,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.756
though even its powers cannot
restore him now.

19:34.839 --> 19:38.968
When his sentence was completed,
Arkady simply wandered away.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.931
The privations he had suffered
had left his mind shattered.

19:43.014 --> 19:46.184
I had lost track of him until he
turned up in that rest home.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.229
You left Duvall to his fate
a century ago.

19:49.604 --> 19:51.272
Why come back for him now?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.943
Did you really think, Detective,
that in my 600 years of life,

19:55.026 --> 19:58.279
I would've sired only one offspring?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.326
Even before the Phoenix debacle,
I had come to realize

20:03.410 --> 20:08.540
that Arkady was too unbalanced and cruel
to wisely rule my empire.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.961
- But you couldn't forget about him.
- What father can ever forget his son?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.591
Come now, Detective.
I've still a few good years left.

20:18.758 --> 20:20.635
We will cross swords another day.

20:21.344 --> 20:24.556
But for now, let me take my boy home.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.726
