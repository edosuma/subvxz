WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.573
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.573 --> 00:03.734
DADDY!

00:03.734 --> 00:05.276
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:05.276 --> 00:06.437
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.437 --> 00:08.039
DADDY!
 AMANDA!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.510
AMANDA CLARKE NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
BEFORE HE DIED,
HE LEFT A ROAD MAP FOR REVENGE

00:12.012 --> 00:14.645
THAT LED ME TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DESTROYED OUR LIVES.

00:14.645 --> 00:16.687
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO AMANDA CLARKE.

00:16.687 --> 00:18.089
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TOWN?

00:18.089 --> 00:19.220
I JUST CAME FOR A VISIT,

00:19.220 --> 00:21.021
BUT I'M THINKING OF
MAKING IT MORE PERMANENT.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.623
(Charlotte)
JACK'S A REAL KEEPER.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.694
YOU SHOULD TRY
TO HOLD ON TO THAT ONE.

00:23.694 --> 00:25.096
THAT'S THE PLAN.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.497
YOU'VE HAD A TARGET ON MY HEAD

00:26.497 --> 00:28.329
SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.460
(grunts)

00:29.460 --> 00:30.631
(grunt)

00:30.631 --> 00:32.133
(crying)

00:32.133 --> 00:35.536
(Emily) FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
LEADING AN ORDINARY LIFE,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.538
FAME HOLDS
AN HYPNOTIC ATTRACTION.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.212
(continues crying)

00:41.212 --> 00:44.515
MANY WOULD SOONER PERISH
THAN EXIST IN ANONYMITY.

00:44.515 --> 00:46.177
BUT FOR THE UNLUCKY FEW

00:46.177 --> 00:49.120
WHO'VE HAD NOTORIETY
FORCED UPON THEM,

00:49.120 --> 00:50.781
INFAMY CAN BE A SENTENCE

00:50.781 --> 00:55.526
MORE DAMNING
THAN ANY PRISON TERM.

00:55.526 --> 00:58.089
(Daniel) HEY.

00:58.089 --> 01:00.231
GOOD BOOK?

01:00.231 --> 01:02.093
RIVETING.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.167
ANOTHER LATE NIGHT
AT THE EMPIRE?

01:06.167 --> 01:08.169
I SHARE A LAST NAME
WITH THE C.E.O.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.172
YOU'D THINK I'D HAVE
LESS TO PROVE, NOT MORE.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.174
I'M SURE YOUR DAD'S HAPPY TO SEE
YOU TAKING IT SO SERIOUSLY.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.245
WELL, HE'D BETTER BE.

01:14.245 --> 01:16.247
I'VE DECIDED TO PUT
BUSINESS SCHOOL ON HOLD

01:16.247 --> 01:18.309
AND STAY WITH THE COMPANY.
 WOW. THAT'S BIG NEWS.

01:18.309 --> 01:19.480
YEAH.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.781
GOOD NEWS?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.353
UH...

01:22.353 --> 01:24.315
I'M SORRY. IT'S MY MOTHER.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.187
I MEAN, SHE'S...

01:26.187 --> 01:29.190
BEEN PRETTY RATTLED ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH TYLER.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.192
AND SHE'S ALL ALONE
UP AT THE HOUSE

01:31.192 --> 01:33.424
AND WAS HOPING MAYBE I'D
MOVE BACK IN FOR THE SUMMER.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.426
(inhales deeply)

01:35.426 --> 01:37.128
WELL, IT'S...

01:37.128 --> 01:39.370
NOT LIKE WE WOULDN'T
STILL SEE EACH OTHER.

01:39.370 --> 01:41.172
YOU THINK I SHOULD DO IT?

01:41.172 --> 01:43.134
I...

01:43.134 --> 01:44.775
THINK SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

01:44.775 --> 01:46.407
(sighs)

01:50.311 --> 01:52.483
WHEN THE SEASON'S OVER,
I WAS THINKING,

01:52.483 --> 01:55.146
MAYBE YOU AND I COULD GET
A PLACE IN THE CITY.

01:55.146 --> 01:58.189
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY BEEN
KIND OF LIVING TOGETHER.

01:59.490 --> 02:02.122
WHICH HAS BEEN WONDERFUL.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.526
BUT I NEVER REALLY IMAGINED
THAT I WOULD

02:05.526 --> 02:07.528
GET A PLACE

02:07.528 --> 02:10.161
WITH SOMEBODY
UNTIL I WAS MARRIED.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.263
MY PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY...

02:12.263 --> 02:14.134
PRETTY TRADITIONAL.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.136
AND KEEPING
THOSE TRADITIONS ALIVE, I--

02:16.136 --> 02:19.910
I FEEL LIKE I'M HONORING THEM
IN A SMALL WAY.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.712
YEAH. I GET IT.

02:21.712 --> 02:23.214
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LOVE YOU,

02:23.214 --> 02:25.246
AND I WANT TO BE WITH YOU,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.678
JUST IN THE RIGHT WAY.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.784
OF COURSE,
ONE DOESN'T OFTEN CONSIDER

02:33.784 --> 02:35.286
THE ROLE OF INSPIRATION

02:35.286 --> 02:37.157
IN THE WORK
OF NONFICTION WRITING.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.430
IN MY ADMITTEDLY BIASED OPINION,
THAT IS AN OVERSIGHT.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.732
IT IS VERY MUCH
A FACTOR OF MY WORK.

02:41.732 --> 02:44.835
ONLY IT COMES FROM WITHOUT,

02:44.835 --> 02:46.337
NOT FROM WITHIN--

02:46.337 --> 02:49.440
FROM THE DECEITS PERPETRATED
BY THE WORST AMONG US.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.203
MY SUBJECTS ARE ALWAYS
MY INSPIRATION.

02:52.203 --> 02:53.704
WHAT A TOOL.
 (applause)

02:53.704 --> 02:56.277
MM. EXACTLY.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.280
(indistinct conversations)

02:59.280 --> 03:00.881
OH... MASON.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.213
THANK YOU.
 (kisses)

03:02.213 --> 03:03.384
SO WELL DONE.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.256
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING.

03:05.256 --> 03:06.387
VICTORIA.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.389
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU KNEW MASON TREADWELL.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.391
OH, WE'RE THICK AS THIEVES.
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.523
MASON, THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR--
EMILY THORNE.

03:12.523 --> 03:15.195
I OWN THE HOUSE THAT
DAVID CLARKE WAS ARRESTED IN.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.927
YOU DON'T SAY?

03:16.927 --> 03:18.599
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.601
REALLY AMAZING BOOK.
I-IMPECCABLY RESEARCHED.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.573
(chuckles)
WOULD YOU MIND?

03:22.573 --> 03:23.904
SURE. THANK YOU.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.406
YOU KNOW, IF YOU AREN'T
ALREADY ON THE LIST,

03:25.406 --> 03:27.838
VICTORIA KINDLY OFFERED
HER HOME FOR A READING

03:27.838 --> 03:30.681
OF MY UNPUBLISHED MEMOIRS
THIS WEEKEND.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.383
YOU SHOULD DROP IN.

03:32.383 --> 03:33.684
I WOULD LOVE TO.

03:33.684 --> 03:37.388
MAY I INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIEND--NOLAN ROSS?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.420
(indistinct conversations
continue)

03:39.420 --> 03:41.322
A FRIEND THAT NEEDS
NO INTRODUCTION--

03:41.322 --> 03:43.354
"WIRED" MAGAZINE'S
MAN OF THE DECADE,

03:43.354 --> 03:45.526
NUMBER SEVEN ON "FORBES'"
YOUNGEST BILLIONAIRES.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.329
WELL, SIX, ACTUALLY,
BUT WHO'S COUNTING? (chuckles)

03:48.329 --> 03:49.300
(Emily and Mason laugh)

03:49.300 --> 03:50.631
NOLAN,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.633
AS A RESULT OF RECENT EVENTS,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.336
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I COULD
DIE AT ANY TIME.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.969
YES, I HEARD THAT LITTLE DEVIANT
TYLER LEFT YOU BOUND AND GAGGED.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.872
(Nolan) OH, IT'D BE A SHAME
IF I LEFT THIS MORTAL COIL

04:01.872 --> 04:05.015
WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING
THE REAL ME. (chuckles)

04:05.015 --> 04:07.778
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE MARKET
FOR A BIOGRAPHER.

04:07.778 --> 04:09.380
NOT JUST ANY BIOGRAPHER.
(chuckles)

04:09.380 --> 04:10.881
WHY DON'T YOU STOP BY
THE COTTAGE,

04:10.881 --> 04:12.883
AND WE'LL DISCUSS
THE POSSIBILITIES?

04:12.883 --> 04:15.426
OH, CHARMING.

04:15.426 --> 04:16.927
QUITE A TURNOUT.

04:16.927 --> 04:18.289
(laughs)

04:18.289 --> 04:19.360
THANK YOU.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.031
TA TA. OKAY.
THEY'RE LOVELY.

04:21.031 --> 04:23.664
MASON, COULD YOU COME
TO THE HOUSE FOR LUNCH?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.737
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

04:26.737 --> 04:29.340
HOW COULD I REFUSE?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.573
(telephone rings)

04:32.573 --> 04:34.405
THANK YOU.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.876
STOWAWAY.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.978
Jack, it's Emily.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.280
EMILY.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.412
How are you?

04:41.412 --> 04:43.414
I'M GOOD,
THANKS TO YOU AND DANIEL.

04:43.414 --> 04:46.387
I JUST WANTED TO CALL AND SAY
THANKS AGAIN FOR INTERVENING.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.389
What you guys did
was really brave.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.690
WELL, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

04:49.690 --> 04:51.692
THERE WERE NO BULLETS
IN THE GUN, SO...

04:51.692 --> 04:53.364
NO BIG DEAL.

04:53.364 --> 04:54.995
HOW'S AMANDA?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.497
She's, uh, she's okay.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.399
YEAH. SHE, UH...

04:58.399 --> 05:00.471
IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD,

05:00.471 --> 05:02.473
all that stuff Tyler said
about her dad,

05:02.473 --> 05:04.435
BUT SHE'LL BE--
SHE'LL BE FINE.

05:04.435 --> 05:05.636
(laughs) I GOTTA GO.

05:05.636 --> 05:07.608
I'LL, UH,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.909
BYE, JACK.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.411
BYE.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.084
WHERE'S LITTLE BROTHER?

05:14.084 --> 05:16.847
I LET HIM GO.

05:16.847 --> 05:18.389
(laughs)

05:18.389 --> 05:19.950
FIELD TRIP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.693
PREP SCHOOL REGISTRATION.

05:22.693 --> 05:24.455
WE NEED A FIELD TRIP.

05:24.455 --> 05:27.458
WHAT ABOUT ATLANTIC CITY?

05:27.458 --> 05:28.629
(chuckles)

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
A LITTLE GAMBLING,
A LITTLE CLUBBING,

05:30.531 --> 05:32.563
A LITTLE TROUBLE.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.365
MM. SOUNDS GREAT.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.767
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'VE GOT A BAR TO RUN.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.939
(clicks tongue)
SNOOZEFEST.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.441
(laughs)

05:40.441 --> 05:42.543
DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF DOING
THE SAME THING EVERY NIGHT,

05:42.543 --> 05:45.946
SEEING THE SAME PEOPLE,
LISTENING TO THE SAME MUSIC?

05:45.946 --> 05:48.779
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.120
COME ON. BE IMPULSIVE.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.622
UNPLAN YOUR LIFE.

05:51.622 --> 05:52.823
AMANDA...

05:52.823 --> 05:54.354
I'M SORRY.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.686
I CAN'T.

05:56.987 --> 05:59.730
I WONDER IF YOU'D SAY NO
TO EMILY THORNE.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.436
(indistinct conversations)

06:05.436 --> 06:08.138
(door opens and closes)

06:08.138 --> 06:11.141
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AMAZED AT HOW
YOU CAN MAKE 20,000 SQUARE FEET

06:11.141 --> 06:12.743
FEEL WARM AND INVITING.

06:12.743 --> 06:14.545
(laughs)

06:14.545 --> 06:17.908
STILL, WITHOUT CONRAD,
IT FEELS SOMEHOW EMPTY.

06:17.908 --> 06:20.581
NOW RUMOR HAS IT,
HE'S MOVED IN TO THE SOUTHFORK.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.553
AND GOOD RIDDANCE.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.985
THIS IS ONE VILLAGE
THAT WON'T MISS ITS IDIOT.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.457
(chuckles)

06:26.457 --> 06:28.919
BESIDES, I DIDN'T
BRING YOU HERE FOR CONRAD.

06:28.919 --> 06:30.891
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
FOR AMANDA CLARKE.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.993
AMANDA CLARKE?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.565
YES.

06:34.565 --> 06:37.528
SHE'S RETURNED TO TOWN,
AND I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT WHY.

06:37.528 --> 06:39.530
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

06:39.530 --> 06:41.872
YOU INTERVIEWED HER
AFTER THE TRIAL.

06:41.872 --> 06:44.835
TELL HER YOU'D LIKE TO TALK
TO HER ABOUT YOUR MEMOIRS

06:44.835 --> 06:46.707
AS A WAY OF REFLECTING
ON THE PAST.

06:48.879 --> 06:51.141
I'M NOT SURE
I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.513
THEN GET COMFORTABLE
WITH IT.

06:54.144 --> 06:56.186
YOU'D STILL BE COVERING
EARNINGS REPORTS

06:56.186 --> 06:57.518
IN THE BACK PAGES
OF THE "JOURNAL"

06:57.518 --> 06:59.049
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME.

06:59.049 --> 07:00.521
DON'T FORGET IT.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.922
TRUST ME,
ONE DOESN'T EASILY FORGET

07:01.922 --> 07:04.525
A DEAL HE'S MADE
WITH THE DEVIL.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.826
(chuckles)

07:05.826 --> 07:07.558
(chuckles)

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
FINE. I'LL TALK TO HER.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.664
I'M SURE THE GIRL IS JUST HERE
TO GET SOME CLOSURE.

07:13.664 --> 07:17.007
THE QUESTION IS HOW FAR
SHE WILL GO TO GET IT.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.013
(David's voice) "BY THE TIME
THE TRIAL ENDED,

07:23.013 --> 07:24.875
"EVERY PERSON
I ONCE TRUSTED

07:24.875 --> 07:26.677
"HAD TURNED THEIR BACK ON ME.

07:26.677 --> 07:29.580
"THE ONLY REMAINING OPTION WAS
TO FIND AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER

07:29.580 --> 07:31.582
"TO TELL MY STORY.

07:31.582 --> 07:35.856
I THOUGHT MASON TREADWELL
WOULD BE THAT PERSON."

07:35.856 --> 07:38.228
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE SCOPE OF THE COVER-UP.

07:38.228 --> 07:40.230
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
ON EVERY LEVEL--

07:40.230 --> 07:42.963
PROSECUTORS,
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, FRIENDS,

07:42.963 --> 07:44.495
COWORKERS.

07:44.495 --> 07:46.497
WELL, SETTING ASIDE
THE LOGISTICS OF YOUR THEORY,

07:46.497 --> 07:48.899
WHY DO YOU THINK ALL THESE
PEOPLE FROM YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE

07:48.899 --> 07:50.701
WOULD TURN ON YOU
SO RAMPANTLY?

07:50.701 --> 07:53.243
JUST PROMISES OF POWER,
MONEY,

07:53.243 --> 07:55.576
POLITICAL FAVORS.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.877
(David)
I MEAN, YOU NAME IT.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.549
AND THEN WHEN I THINK
THOSE DIDN'T WORK,

07:58.549 --> 07:59.880
THEY USED THREATS.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.652
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:01.652 --> 08:02.953
IF THEY COULD PUT ME
IN HERE,

08:02.953 --> 08:07.487
IMAGINE WHAT ELSE
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

08:11.622 --> 08:13.123
IN HIS TWISTED MIND,
HE IS.

08:13.123 --> 08:15.265
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WITHIN
THE PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY

08:15.265 --> 08:17.868
IS ADVANCED
PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSISM.

08:20.671 --> 08:21.832
NOT A SHRED.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.697
(pen lid clicks)

08:51.702 --> 08:54.705
♪♪♪

09:02.613 --> 09:06.016
THE STOWAWAY TAVERN.
HOW FITTING.

09:09.079 --> 09:11.221
COULD I TROUBLE YOU
FOR A LIGHT?

09:11.221 --> 09:12.783
SORRY.

09:12.783 --> 09:14.785
THERE'S NO SMOKING INSIDE.

09:14.785 --> 09:15.926
COME NOW.

09:15.926 --> 09:20.230
THERE ARE NO PATRONS INSIDE.
WHO WOULD POSSIBLY OBJECT?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.702
OH. IT'S AFTER 11:00.
WHY NOT?

09:31.702 --> 09:33.303
I'LL HAVE A GIBSON.

09:33.303 --> 09:35.045
A GIBSON?

09:35.045 --> 09:36.677
(chuckles)
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

09:36.677 --> 09:37.678
OH, YES.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.149
(chuckles)

09:42.082 --> 09:44.855
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU... AMANDA?

09:44.855 --> 09:46.657
SHOULD I?

09:46.657 --> 09:48.659
(chuckles) I WOULDN'T
HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU EITHER.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.220
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.022
MASON TREADWELL.

09:52.022 --> 09:54.625
I INTERVIEWED YOU
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.926
A COUPLE OF TIMES,
ACTUALLY.

09:55.926 --> 09:58.328
IT WAS FOR MY BOOK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER--

09:58.328 --> 09:59.830
"THE SOCIETY CONNECTION."

09:59.830 --> 10:01.832
RIGHT. MASON.

10:01.832 --> 10:04.034
I'M SORRY. UH...

10:04.034 --> 10:07.307
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T REMEMBER
ABOUT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.109
OH, OF COURSE.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.711
AHH.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.683
SO, UM...

10:12.683 --> 10:13.944
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

10:13.944 --> 10:16.747
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.749
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU AND I

10:18.749 --> 10:20.751
COULD SIT DOWN
AND TALK ABOUT THAT.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.152
I'M, UH, FINISHING UP
MY MEMOIRS,

10:22.152 --> 10:24.354
AND I WOULD LOVE
TO INCLUDE A...

10:24.354 --> 10:26.997
REPRISE CHAPTER OF SORTS
ABOUT YOU.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.703
TOMORROW?

10:32.703 --> 10:34.334
AT MY HOUSE?

10:39.269 --> 10:40.941
WELL,
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR

10:40.941 --> 10:42.943
THAT YOUR PRENUP IS WELL ON
ITS WAY TO BEING NULLIFIED

10:42.943 --> 10:44.644
DUE TO DURESS.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.947
THANK YOU, RYAN, FOR GOING
ABOVE AND BEYOND ON THAT ONE.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.779
WHERE DO WE STAND
WITH CHARLOTTE?

10:48.779 --> 10:50.420
WELL, AT THIS TIME, THERE'S NO
COMPELLING LEGAL ARGUMENT

10:50.420 --> 10:52.282
TO FORCE HER BACK HOME
WITH YOU,

10:52.282 --> 10:53.824
BUT BELIEVE ME,
I'LL CONTINUE TO DIG.

10:53.824 --> 10:56.887
RIGHT NOW MY MAIN CONCERN IS
YOUR INTEREST IN GRAYSON GLOBAL.

10:56.887 --> 10:59.089
IT SEEMS CONRAD IS SEEKING

10:59.089 --> 11:01.732
TO DIVEST YOU OF YOUR STOCK
IN THE COMPANY.

11:01.732 --> 11:02.933
IS HE INSANE?

11:02.933 --> 11:05.095
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
REMIND THAT MAN

11:05.095 --> 11:06.767
THAT I EARNED EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THOSE SHARES,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.799
AND WITHOUT ME,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE--
 HE'S NOT INSANE.

11:08.799 --> 11:10.841
HE'S STRONG-ARMING.

11:10.841 --> 11:13.403
BUT BEFORE WE GO INTO
THE RING WITH THEM ON THIS,

11:13.403 --> 11:16.807
I THINK IT'D BE WISE IF WE SET
UP A LITTLE INSURANCE POLICY.

11:16.807 --> 11:18.849
WE NEED CONRAD TO RESTORE

11:18.849 --> 11:20.310
DANIEL'S ACCESS
TO HIS GRANDFATHER'S TRUST.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.913
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO INVOLVE
MY SON IN THIS?

11:22.913 --> 11:25.685
WELL, BY HIS OWN DECLARATION,
HE'S ALREADY INVOLVED.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.217
AND HE'S ON YOUR SIDE.

11:27.217 --> 11:29.219
COMBINE DANIEL'S SHARES
WITH YOURS...

11:29.219 --> 11:31.261
AND WE CONTROL THE COMPANY.

11:31.261 --> 11:32.422
RIGHT.

11:32.422 --> 11:34.024
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T
SIMPLY ASK CONRAD

11:34.024 --> 11:36.396
TO RELEASE DANIEL'S STAKE
IN THE FIRM TO HIM.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.328
HE'D PUT TOGETHER
THE PIECES IMMEDIATELY.

11:38.328 --> 11:41.772
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK.
DANIEL IS.

11:41.772 --> 11:44.074
THEN IT BECOMES
A SIMPLE QUESTION OF LOYALTY--

11:44.074 --> 11:45.876
CONRAD'S TO DANIEL,

11:45.876 --> 11:47.908
AND DANIEL'S TO YOU.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.379
(clock ticks)

11:53.784 --> 11:54.915
WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE CAMPUS?

11:54.915 --> 11:56.947
BIG. EXPENSIVE.

11:56.947 --> 11:58.819
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE
A COLLEGE THAN A PREP SCHOOL.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.921
KIND OF IS.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.824
(sighs) MY SCHEDULE
IS GONNA BE BRUTAL--

12:03.824 --> 12:04.855
CALCULUS,

12:04.855 --> 12:05.996
A.P. PHYSICS,
A.P. FRENCH--

12:05.996 --> 12:08.158
I THOUGHT I TESTED OUT
OF FRENCH--

12:08.158 --> 12:09.960
DEBATE, TENNIS,

12:09.960 --> 12:11.401
AND I HAVE TO READ
"PARADISE LOST"

12:11.401 --> 12:13.233
BEFORE LITERARY SOCIETY
IN TWO WEEKS.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.865
YEAH, WELL, YOU WEREN'T
KIDDING, WERE YOU?

12:14.865 --> 12:16.036
ABOUT WHAT?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.237
WELL, YOU KNOW,
AFTER THE SUMMER,

12:17.237 --> 12:18.869
I'M NEVER GONNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.340
I WAS EXAGGERATING.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.943
I'LL HAVE TIME OFF
FOR THANKSGIVING...

12:22.943 --> 12:26.516
UNLESS I GO TO GENEVA
WITH THE MODEL U.N. TEAM.

12:26.516 --> 12:27.918
GREAT.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.249
I'LL SEE YOU AT CHRISTMAS.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.181
DON'T BE LIKE THIS,
DECLAN.

12:31.181 --> 12:34.384
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I CAN BE
QUITE THE MULTITASKER.

12:34.384 --> 12:35.886
I BELIEVE YOU.

12:35.886 --> 12:39.389
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW I FEEL
ABOUT BEING ONE OF YOUR TASKS.

12:43.934 --> 12:47.097
(indistinct conversations)

12:47.097 --> 12:49.139
EXPECTING SOMEONE,
A DATE?

12:49.139 --> 12:51.401
(laughs) NO.
LAWYER. SHE'S LATE.

12:51.401 --> 12:54.044
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

12:54.044 --> 12:56.046
NOW THAT I'M LEAVING
BUSINESS SCHOOL

12:56.046 --> 12:58.108
AND COMMITTING MYSELF
TO THE COMPANY,

12:58.108 --> 13:00.851
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT YOU RELEASE MY TRUST.

13:00.851 --> 13:02.152
MOM'S AGREED TO SIGN OFF
ON IT,

13:02.152 --> 13:03.854
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
I NEED YOU TO AS WELL.

13:03.854 --> 13:05.886
RENEGOTIATING THE TERMS
OF YOUR EMPLOY ALREADY?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.919
THAT'S, UH...
THAT'S THE GRAYSON WAY.

13:08.919 --> 13:10.921
WELL, CONSIDER IT
A SHOW OF FAITH.

13:10.921 --> 13:13.163
I'M READY TO TAKE MY SEAT
AT THE TABLE.

13:13.163 --> 13:15.896
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.028
I'LL HAVE THE LAWYERS
GET INTO IT.

13:18.028 --> 13:18.999
AM I INTERRUPTING?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.201
OH, NO.
NO, I WAS JUST LEAVING.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.033
THANKS, DAD.

13:23.033 --> 13:26.576
(indistinct conversations)

13:26.576 --> 13:27.978
YES, SIR.

13:27.978 --> 13:29.479
SO DANIEL SAYS THAT

13:29.479 --> 13:31.912
HE WANTS TO FOLLOW
IN HIS OLD MAN'S FOOTSTEPS

13:31.912 --> 13:35.185
ON THE CONDITION THAT
I REACTIVATE HIS TRUST.

13:35.185 --> 13:36.947
HIS MOTHER HAS ALREADY
AGREED TO IT.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.288
(chuckles) CURIOUS TIMING,

13:38.288 --> 13:40.050
SINCE OUR REQUEST
TO RECLAIM HER SHARES

13:40.050 --> 13:41.892
JUST WENT OUT THIS MORNING.

13:41.892 --> 13:43.894
YOU DID SAY SHE HAS
A POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HIM.

13:43.894 --> 13:45.495
YEAH, AND IF I
REFUSE HIM OUTRIGHT,

13:45.495 --> 13:47.427
SHE HAS EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS

13:47.427 --> 13:49.429
TO TURN MY SON AGAINST ME
ENTIRELY.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.063
SO LET'S GIVE HIM ACCESS TO
THE TRUST'S SAVINGS ACCOUNT,

13:53.063 --> 13:54.564
BUT AS FAR AS THE SHARES
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL,

13:54.564 --> 13:56.066
LET'S STIPULATE
THEY NOT BE VALID

13:56.066 --> 13:59.169
UNTIL HE MARRIES
OR TURNS 30.

13:59.169 --> 14:01.071
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
THE MARRIAGE CLAUSE?

14:01.071 --> 14:02.472
FROM WHAT YOU TOLD ME,

14:02.472 --> 14:04.314
HE'S GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS
WITH YOUR YOUNG NEIGHBOR.

14:04.314 --> 14:07.047
MY SON IS EASILY DISTRACTED.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.249
IT'S A FAMILY TRAIT.

14:09.249 --> 14:13.023
I'D BE SURPRISED IF THAT
RELATIONSHIP LASTS THE SUMMER.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.926
(indistinct conversations
continue)

14:18.458 --> 14:22.492
THIS COTTAGE BELONGED
TO HEMINGWAY FOR A TIME.

14:22.492 --> 14:23.994
HE WROTE
"THE DANGEROUS SUMMER" HERE.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.536
IT SEEMS THAT CELEBRITY
HAUNTS BOTH OUR HOMES.

14:26.536 --> 14:29.639
MM. VERY DIFFERENT GHOSTS,
THOUGH.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.972
AND THIS IS, AS THEY SAY,
WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.004
ALL MY TOMES BEGIN HERE,

14:34.004 --> 14:36.146
ON A 1920s UNDERWOOD 5,

14:36.146 --> 14:38.108
ONCE OWNED BY JOHN CHEEVER,
I'M TOLD.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.911
AND ON THOSE RARE OCCASIONS

14:40.911 --> 14:42.212
THAT I CAN'T
COME UP WITH A WORD,

14:42.212 --> 14:44.884
I SIMPLY JUST GET OUT OF MY
CHAIR, AND I GO AND LOOK IT UP.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.656
(Emily chuckles)
 (laughs) LIKE THE CAVEMEN.

14:46.656 --> 14:48.118
QUITE THE COLLECTION.

14:48.118 --> 14:49.659
ALL FIRST EDITIONS?

14:49.659 --> 14:51.591
I PRIDE MYSELF
ON RARE ITEMS.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.094
TO WIT, MY SOLE...

14:54.094 --> 14:56.997
WORKING PRINT OF MY MEMOIRS.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.528
NO COPIES?

14:58.528 --> 15:00.570
NO, NOT UNTIL
THE WORK IS COMPLETE.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.202
I FIND THAT DUPLICATION

15:02.202 --> 15:05.275
SOMEHOW COMPROMISES
THE SOUL OF THE PROSE.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.477
YEAH.

15:07.477 --> 15:08.608
OH...

15:08.608 --> 15:11.141
MY SUBJECT RECORDINGS.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.083
YOU NOTED THE RESEARCH
THAT WENT INTO "SOCIETY,"

15:13.083 --> 15:15.085
WELL, THERE IT ALL IS--

15:15.085 --> 15:17.147
HUNDREDS OF HOURS
OF ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

15:17.147 --> 15:19.449
WITH THE KEY PLAYERS.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.451
AS A FAN, YOU MIGHT
BE INTERESTED TO KNOW

15:21.451 --> 15:23.153
THAT I'LL BE REINTERVIEWING

15:23.153 --> 15:25.495
DAVID CLARKE'S DAUGHTER
FOR MY MEMOIRS.

15:25.495 --> 15:28.098

DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

16:59.189 --> 17:02.052

17:06.256 --> 17:07.696
WHAT? NO. JACK AND I

YOU KNOW THAT.

I'M NOT SURE
HE BELIEVES THAT.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.102
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HE'S HEAD OVER HEELS FOR YOU.

17:12.102 --> 17:14.664
ALL HE TALKS ABOUT
IS HOW HAPPY YOU MAKE HIM.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.366
SO WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

17:16.366 --> 17:17.666
OUTSIDE?

17:17.666 --> 17:22.040
I COULD USE SOME FRESH AIR

NO, I'M GOOD,

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRL

17:27.247 --> 17:28.548
WHO USED TO STOCKPILE
PUDDING CUPS

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
SO SHE COULD BRIBE
SERGEANT CANKLES

17:30.250 --> 17:32.152
FOR A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.823
SHE'S STILL HERE,
BELIEVE ME.

17:33.823 --> 17:35.585
REALLY?

TO THE GIRLS

17:46.266 --> 17:48.398
(exhales)
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

17:48.398 --> 17:50.170
THAT MASON TREADWELL
TRACKED YOU DOWN

17:50.170 --> 17:53.273
AND TRIED TO SWEET TALK YOU
INTO AN INTERVIEW?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.574
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
HOW IT HAPPENED,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.776
BUT SO WHAT?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.479
YOU TRUSTED ME TO BE YOU
FOR TEN YEARS.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.581
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS GUY?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
(clicks)

18:03.583 --> 18:05.815
TREADWELL'S A BOTTOM-FEEDER

18:05.815 --> 18:08.618
WHO MADE MILLIONS OFF OF LIES
THAT HE WROTE ABOUT MY FATHER.

18:08.618 --> 18:10.160
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:10.160 --> 18:11.621
I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER
WAS A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

18:11.621 --> 18:13.263
SO DID I,

18:13.263 --> 18:14.764
BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS WRITTEN
IN THAT BOOK.

18:14.764 --> 18:16.866
ARE YOU TELLING ME,
YOUR FATHER WASN'T GUILTY?

18:16.866 --> 18:20.270
I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.133
BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT
UNLESS YOU HELP ME.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.308
(lighter clatters)

18:28.308 --> 18:30.180
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

18:39.189 --> 18:40.350
(Doug Paisley's
"No One But You" playing)

18:40.350 --> 18:41.521
(Jack) HEY.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.692
HEY.

18:42.692 --> 18:43.853
SO HOW WAS YOUR VISIT

18:43.853 --> 18:45.195
TO THE LAND
OF ENTITLED TEENAGERS?

18:45.195 --> 18:46.526
OH, AWESOME,

18:46.526 --> 18:48.298
AND MAYBE THE LAST TIME
I'LL SEE MY GIRLFRIEND,

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
BUT SPEAKING OF GIRLFRIENDS,

18:50.300 --> 18:53.203
LOOKS LIKE AMANDA WAS
IN RARE FORM LAST NIGHT.

18:53.203 --> 18:54.564
OH, GOD.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?

18:54.564 --> 18:56.266
OH, I DID MORE THAN
HEAR ABOUT IT.

18:56.266 --> 18:57.407
MY PHONE'S BEEN BLOWING UP
ALL DAY,

18:57.407 --> 18:59.239
AND THIS IS
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE SHOT...

19:00.870 --> 19:02.242
(sighs)
 RIGHT HERE.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.843
I AM IN WAY OVER MY HEAD
WITH THIS GIRL.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.345
NO. NO, NO, NO.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.217
YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA
FORCE YOU TO LOOSEN UP.

19:07.217 --> 19:08.348
SHE'S A FORCER.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.849
SHE'S DEFINITELY A FORCER.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.552
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE,
OKAY?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.924
YOU'RE TOO TIGHTLY WOUND
FOR A GUY YOUR AGE.

19:14.924 --> 19:17.727
YOU KEEP GOING LIKE THIS,
YOU'RE GONNA END UP LIKE DAD.

19:17.727 --> 19:19.289
(slaps back)
 ALL RIGHT?

19:19.289 --> 19:22.632
♪ PICKED YOURSELF UP
FOR THE ONES THAT YOU CALL ♪

19:23.763 --> 19:25.565
(grunts)

19:25.565 --> 19:27.337
(shell casings clattering)

19:27.337 --> 19:29.939
DID I MENTION THAT I'VE
NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?

19:29.939 --> 19:32.372
IT HELPS IF YOU KEEP
AT LEAST ONE EYE OPEN.
 (buzzer sounds)

19:32.372 --> 19:34.274
WHY'D YOU
BRING HIM HERE AGAIN?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.745
HE'S DANGEROUS.

19:35.745 --> 19:38.248
HE WAS PRETTY TRAUMATIZED
AFTER THE WHOLE TYLER THING--

19:38.248 --> 19:40.250
BEING HELD HOSTAGE
IN HIS OWN HOME.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.411
(clicks)

19:41.411 --> 19:43.883
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
MAKE HIM FEEL SAFE AGAIN.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.685
(paper rustles)

19:47.457 --> 19:50.790
(shell casings clatter)

19:50.790 --> 19:53.823
OH, SOMEBODY LOVES
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT.

19:53.823 --> 19:55.194
DAD AND I SPENT
A LOT OF TIME HERE

19:55.194 --> 19:56.366
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

19:56.366 --> 19:58.328
GOOD TIMES.

19:58.328 --> 20:01.200
BEAT THAT.

20:02.272 --> 20:05.475
(shell casings clattering)

20:07.277 --> 20:09.509
BEST OF THREE?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.210
AH, I CAN'T, BABY.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.813
MY DAD SET UP A MEETING
WITH A PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.645
WANNA COME BY AFTER?

20:15.645 --> 20:17.787
UH, ACTUALLY,

20:17.787 --> 20:19.849
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

20:19.849 --> 20:22.522
ALL RIGHT. UH, WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I SEE YOU.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.223
OKAY.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.325
BYE, DAN.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.297
NOLAN.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.798
(door opens)

20:28.798 --> 20:30.660
WOW.
 (door closes)

20:30.660 --> 20:32.762
FIRST YOU'RE EVICTING THE GUY,

20:32.762 --> 20:34.304
AND NOW
YOU'RE BLOWING HIM OFF?

20:34.304 --> 20:35.635
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--

20:35.635 --> 20:37.236
ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART
GROW FONDER.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.308
(chuckles)

20:38.308 --> 20:40.510
AND I WASN'T LYING.

20:40.510 --> 20:43.413
I DO HAVE PLANS.
SO DO YOU.

20:43.413 --> 20:44.474
REALLY?

20:44.474 --> 20:46.476
MASON'S
INTERVIEWING AMANDA.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.378
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE CONTROL THE STORY.

20:48.378 --> 20:52.352
CONTROL PLUS AMANDA EQUALS
A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.983
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO INVOLVE HER?

20:53.983 --> 20:55.555
I THOUGHT THIS RETRIBUTION

20:55.555 --> 20:57.557
HAD TO DO WITH WHAT TREADWELL
WROTE ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.258
CLEARLY THERE'S MORE
TO THE STORY.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.760
INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.392
TREADWELL STARTED OUT
AS A REPORTER

21:02.392 --> 21:04.464
COVERING THE DOWNING
OF FLIGHT 197,

21:04.464 --> 21:06.836
ONLY BACK THEN,
HE DIDN'T GO BY MASON.

21:06.836 --> 21:08.368
HIS REAL NAME WAS...

21:08.368 --> 21:09.869
LEO TREADWELL.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.871
I'M A JOURNALIST.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.350
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT HERE,
AMANDA?

21:21.951 --> 21:24.484
I'M TOLD THAT
YOUR PRIOR FOSTER HOME

21:24.484 --> 21:26.316
WAS DESTROYED BY A FIRE.

21:26.316 --> 21:27.657
HOW TERRIBLE.

21:27.657 --> 21:31.361
SOMETIMES BAD THINGS HAPPEN
TO GOOD PEOPLE.

21:31.361 --> 21:32.992
INDEED.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.926
I'M HERE BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
SAYS HE'S INNOCENT,

21:36.926 --> 21:38.768
THAT HE DIDN'T DO
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

21:38.768 --> 21:40.630
BUT THEY PROVED IT
IN COURT.

21:40.630 --> 21:43.773
COURTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO MAKE MISTAKES.

21:43.773 --> 21:47.006
DO YOU THINK THEY MADE
A MISTAKE, AMANDA?

21:48.578 --> 21:51.611
(lowered voice) I HAVE TO SAY
HE'S GUILTY...

21:51.611 --> 21:53.443
OR THEY'LL PUT ME AWAY,

21:53.443 --> 21:55.415
JUST LIKE HIM.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.517
I AM NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

22:08.057 --> 22:11.401
I KEEP THIS HERE
WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND IT.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.872
I DON'T THINK HE DID IT.

22:22.872 --> 22:26.045
(lowered voice)
I DON'T EITHER.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.948
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO HELP ME
RESCUE YOUR FATHER?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.583
(Emily)
BUT THE BOOK HE PUBLISHED

22:33.583 --> 22:35.885
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
BY THE GRAYSONS--

22:35.885 --> 22:38.428
ALL THE SAME LIES.

22:38.428 --> 22:39.859
WHAT'S WORSE

22:39.859 --> 22:42.361
IS HE MADE ME BELIEVE THEM.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.933
SO HOW DO YOU MAKE
THE PUNISHMENT

22:43.933 --> 22:47.467
FIT THIS PARTICULAR CRIME?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.499
(clicks)

22:50.470 --> 22:54.504
(shell casings clattering)

23:01.511 --> 23:03.653
(indistinct conversations)

23:03.653 --> 23:05.685
THE C.E.O. IS A CLIENT.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.588
DANIEL, WELCOME.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.461
SOFIE ARNAULT,
MEET MY SECRET WEAPON--DANIEL.

23:11.461 --> 23:12.592
NICE TO MEET YOU.
 HI.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.093
SOFIE'S GRANDFATHER
IS FARRIS ARNAULT--

23:14.093 --> 23:15.625
OF ARNAULT OFFSHORE.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.026
THE ONE AND ONLY.

23:17.026 --> 23:18.628
AND I'M AFRAID...

23:18.628 --> 23:20.399
I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING
TO GET TO,

23:20.399 --> 23:24.073
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU IN THE VERY
CAPABLE HANDS OF MY SON.

23:24.073 --> 23:25.404
(front desk bell dings)

23:25.404 --> 23:27.507
(indistinct conversations)

23:27.507 --> 23:29.108
I THINK I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.910
YOU'RE HEAVILY INVESTED
IN YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.411
WHICH IS ADMIRABLE,

23:32.411 --> 23:33.683
BUT WHEN THE EURO'S
IN A TAILSPIN,

23:33.683 --> 23:35.515
LOYALTY DOESN'T PAY DIVIDENDS.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.487
YOU WANT TO DIVERSIFY.
 I'M THINKING CHINA.

23:37.487 --> 23:38.618
OH, EVERYBODY'S
THINKING CHINA.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.820
WE NEED TO GET YOU
AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.522
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
 (front desk bell dings)

23:42.522 --> 23:44.423
BUT I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL

23:44.423 --> 23:46.556
ABOUT WHO I CHOOSE
TO GET INTO BED WITH.

23:46.556 --> 23:48.958
WELL, LIKE MY FATHER SAID,
YOU'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.500
(indistinct conversations
continue)

23:50.500 --> 23:52.902
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT
EVEN MORE.

24:39.609 --> 24:40.680
(clicking)

24:40.680 --> 24:41.851
(Amanda) NO.

24:43.653 --> 24:44.954
SO I SEE
YOU'RE STILL A CLARKE.

24:44.954 --> 24:47.717
WHY KEEP
YOUR FATHER'S LAST NAME?

24:47.717 --> 24:50.690
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH POINT
IN HIDING WHO I WAS.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.491
YOU DIDN'T MIND BEING
THE DAUGHTER

24:52.491 --> 24:54.664
OF A-A MAN
WHO FINANCED TERRORISM?

24:54.664 --> 24:57.667
IN SOME WAYS, IT HELPED ME.

24:57.667 --> 24:59.829
IT SHOWED ME
WHO MY TRUE FRIENDS WERE.

24:59.829 --> 25:01.831
MM.

25:01.831 --> 25:04.173
AND NOW HERE YOU ARE,
BACK AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME,

25:04.173 --> 25:06.005
NEARLY TWO DECADES LATER.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.108
I WOULD THINK THAT
THE MEMORIES ARE QUITE PAINFUL.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.040
SOME.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.112
on my terms.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.715
I WON'T LET THE PAST
HAVE POWER OVER ME...

25:15.715 --> 25:17.186
NOT ANYMORE.

25:17.186 --> 25:19.619
WELL, STILL... (sighs)

25:19.619 --> 25:22.722
SOME PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU
AS A VICTIM OF THE SCANDAL,

25:22.722 --> 25:25.194
one who might be
carrying a grudge.

25:25.194 --> 25:26.696
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE...

25:26.696 --> 25:28.698
A GOOD PERSON
AND LIVE A GOOD LIFE.

25:28.698 --> 25:32.702
LATELY, I EVEN STARTED THINKING
ABOUT PUTTING DOWN ROOTS.

25:32.702 --> 25:35.264
I may even start a family.

25:35.264 --> 25:36.766
LOOK OUT, CAPTAIN JACK.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.668
THIS LITTLE BIRDIE'S
IN SEARCH OF NEST.

25:38.668 --> 25:40.109
AMANDA, STAY FOCUSED.

25:42.111 --> 25:45.615
It's our turn
to ask the questions.

25:45.615 --> 25:47.577
WHEN YOU CAME TO SEE ME
AFTER MY FATHER'S TRIAL,

25:47.577 --> 25:50.079
YOU TOLD ME TO TRUST YOU,
AND I DID.

25:50.079 --> 25:51.951
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH...

25:51.951 --> 25:55.124
THAT I HAD SEEN MY FATHER
AND VICTORIA GRAYSON TOGETHER,

25:55.124 --> 25:56.886
ROMANTICALLY,

25:56.886 --> 25:59.228
THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN
THERE THAT NIGHT ON THE PORCH.

25:59.228 --> 26:00.760
WHEW. SHE'S GOOD.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.261
You were a child.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.763
YOUR MENTAL STATE
WAS IN QUESTION.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.935
I-I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

26:05.935 --> 26:07.597
NO.

26:07.597 --> 26:09.839
YOU CHOSE TO TAKE HERS.

26:09.839 --> 26:12.141
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR WORD, LEO?

26:12.141 --> 26:14.243
(lowered voice)
I DON'T THINK HE DID IT.

26:14.243 --> 26:15.745
(lowered voice)
I DON'T EITHER.

26:15.745 --> 26:18.177
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO HELP ME
RESCUE YOUR FATHER?

26:19.979 --> 26:22.782
YOU DIDN'T PRINT A WORD
OF WHAT I SAID TO YOU.

26:24.113 --> 26:25.785
ALL STORIES
HAVE COMPETING TRUTHS.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.286
I SIMPLY...

26:27.286 --> 26:29.088
SETTLED ON
THE MOST LOGICAL.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.321
AND YOU WERE PAID HANDSOMELY
FOR THAT ENDORSEMENT, I'M SURE.

26:32.321 --> 26:34.664
AMANDA, YOU'RE CONFUSED.

26:34.664 --> 26:36.325
YOU DON'T HAVE
ALL THE FACTS.

26:36.325 --> 26:39.168
HERE ARE THE FACTS--YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW YOU'RE A FRAUD.

26:39.168 --> 26:41.801
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.033
STAND UP, AMANDA.
GET IN HIS FACE.

26:44.033 --> 26:45.374
YOUR READING AT VICTORIA'S

26:45.374 --> 26:47.206
IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO REDEEM YOURSELF.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.278
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT.

26:49.278 --> 26:51.280
GO, AMANDA.

27:01.090 --> 27:03.993
CHECK YOU OUT, CYRANO.

27:03.993 --> 27:05.624
YOU'VE JUST TEED LEO UP

27:05.624 --> 27:08.627
TO BLOW THE LID OFF
THE WHOLE CONSPIRACY.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.799
(exhales)

27:09.799 --> 27:12.702
I WOULD SEEM THAT WAY,
WOULDN'T IT?

27:23.242 --> 27:25.915
THE ROSE COUTURE
OR THE HERVE LEGER?

27:25.915 --> 27:28.317
MM.
NO MORE BANDAGE DRESSES.

27:28.317 --> 27:30.149
RIGHT. I'LL HAVE IT BURNED
IMMEDIATELY.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.851
EVERYBODY DECENT?
 (knocks on door)

27:31.851 --> 27:34.223
DANIEL, COME IN.

27:34.223 --> 27:35.925
HEY.

27:35.925 --> 27:37.086
DARLING.

27:37.086 --> 27:38.657
HEY.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.059
ASH, CAN YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE?

27:40.059 --> 27:41.931
OF COURSE.

27:43.993 --> 27:45.695
LISTEN, DAD THREW US
A CURVEBALL.

27:45.695 --> 27:46.996
NOW WHAT?

27:46.996 --> 27:48.898
HE HAD ME MEET WITH
THIS WOMAN,

27:48.898 --> 27:50.940
SUPPOSEDLY
A PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR,

27:50.940 --> 27:52.101
BUT I THINK HE PROMISED HER

27:52.101 --> 27:53.242
A LOT MORE
THAN FINANCIAL ADVICE.

27:53.242 --> 27:55.104
HE SET YOU UP ON DATE?

27:55.104 --> 27:56.145
YEAH. SOFIE ARNAULT.

27:56.145 --> 27:58.007
OH, WELL, I'LL GIVE HIM
POINTS FOR TASTE.

27:58.007 --> 27:59.348
WELL, IT MADE ME SUSPICIOUS,

27:59.348 --> 28:01.010
SO I CHECKED THE FINE PRINT
ON MY TRUST.

28:01.010 --> 28:03.112
IT TURNS OUT, HE HAD
THE CONDITIONS AMENDED.

28:03.112 --> 28:04.814
I GET ACCESS TO THE CASH,
BUT WON'T BE

28:04.814 --> 28:06.816
FULLY VESTED IN THE COMPANY
UNTIL I TURN 30

28:06.816 --> 28:08.187
OR GET MARRIED,

28:08.187 --> 28:09.719
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.721
WELL, IT WAS WORTH A TRY.
THANKS, DARLING.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.022
THE FIGHT'S NOT OVER, MOM.

28:13.022 --> 28:14.994
ALL I NEED IS EMILY TO SAY YES,
AND I COLLECT THOSE SHARES.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.165
NO, DANIEL.

28:16.165 --> 28:18.728
MOM, I LOVE HER...
SO WHY WAIT?

28:18.728 --> 28:21.030
WHAT DO PEOPLE
WAIT FOR EXACTLY, A SIGN?

28:21.030 --> 28:23.032
MAYBE THIS IS IT.
 PEOPLE WAIT FOR CERTAINTY.

28:23.032 --> 28:24.703
DID YOU HAVE THAT
WITH DAD?

28:24.703 --> 28:27.376
NO, AND THAT'S WHY
I WANT IT FOR YOU.

28:29.038 --> 28:30.279
(inhales and sighs)

28:30.279 --> 28:31.981
LET'S DISCUSS THIS LATER.

28:31.981 --> 28:34.013
I HAVE GUESTS COMING
AND I HAVE TO GET DRESSED.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.314
I WANT TO BE WITH HER, MOM,

28:35.314 --> 28:36.986
AND IF IT GIVES YOU
THE UPPER HAND AGAINST DAD,

28:36.986 --> 28:39.118
THEN WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT
AGAINST IT?

28:48.127 --> 28:51.060
ASHLEY,
ARE YOU OUT THERE?

28:51.060 --> 28:52.762
YES.

28:52.762 --> 28:54.263
IS EMILY COMING
TO THE READING?

28:54.263 --> 28:55.364
YEAH,
I THINK SHE JUST ARRIVED.

28:55.364 --> 28:57.436
GOOD.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.770
I NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

29:02.411 --> 29:04.143
(doorbell rings)

29:04.143 --> 29:06.145
I DON'T SEE THE GUEST OF HONOR.
DO YOU?

29:06.145 --> 29:08.948
MM. MAYBE HE ACCIDENTALLY
STRANGLED HIMSELF

29:08.948 --> 29:10.149
WITH AN ASCOT.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.450
(chuckles)

29:11.450 --> 29:13.182
EMILY, WALK WITH ME?

29:13.182 --> 29:14.223
SURE.

29:14.223 --> 29:16.125
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:16.125 --> 29:17.827
MASON DIDN'T CANCEL ON YOU,
DID HE?

29:17.827 --> 29:20.129
NO, HE'S JUST RUNNING LATE.
THIS IS ABOUT DANIEL.

29:20.129 --> 29:23.362
DID HE TELL YOU HOW CONRAD
ALTERED THE TERMS OF HIS TRUST?

29:23.362 --> 29:26.365
NO. WHY WOULD HE
DISCUSS THAT WITH ME?
 (doorbell rings)

29:26.365 --> 29:28.938
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY WOULD
HE DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU?

29:28.938 --> 29:30.199
WELL, HE DIDN'T.

29:30.199 --> 29:31.500
MY EARS JUST HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE

29:31.500 --> 29:33.202
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

29:33.202 --> 29:35.774
THE AMENDMENT MAKES IT
SO THE ONLY WAY

29:35.774 --> 29:39.148
DANIEL CAN FULLY ACCESS
HIS TRUST BEFORE HE TURNS 30

29:39.148 --> 29:41.881
IS TO GET MARRIED.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.212
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

29:43.212 --> 29:45.254
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

29:45.254 --> 29:47.256
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD WANT
TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

29:47.256 --> 29:50.820
MY BOYFRIEND'S MOTIVES WERE PURE
BEFORE HE BECAME MY FIANCE.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.091
(indistinct conversations)

29:52.091 --> 29:53.823
(doorbell rings)

29:53.823 --> 29:57.566
(instrumental jazz music
playing)

29:57.566 --> 30:01.200
(people speaking indistinctly)

30:01.200 --> 30:03.172
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

30:03.172 --> 30:05.204
I'VE BEEN WRITING SOME
NEW MATERIAL FOR THE READING.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.335
WELL, YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO CALL ME

30:06.335 --> 30:07.907
AFTER YOU SPOKE
WITH AMANDA CLARKE.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.839
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

30:09.839 --> 30:12.281
THAT SHE'S A VERY ANGRY GIRL
WITH A SHARP MEMORY.

30:12.281 --> 30:14.113
WHAT EXACTLY
DOES SHE REMEMBER?

30:14.113 --> 30:17.016
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.148
SHE WANTS TO PULL ON THAT THREAD
UNTIL IT UNRAVELS EVERYTHING,

30:19.148 --> 30:21.250
AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN...

30:21.250 --> 30:23.152
I'LL GO DOWN
AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FRAUDS

30:23.152 --> 30:24.854
IN LITERARY HISTORY.

30:24.854 --> 30:26.155
(music continues)

30:26.155 --> 30:28.227
THERE ARE FAR WORSE FATES.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.129
(people speak indistinctly)

30:30.129 --> 30:33.202
I'M HERE TO GET YOUR SIDE
OF THE STORY, MRS. GRAYSON.

30:33.202 --> 30:35.464
DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE
TO DAVID CLARKE'S ALLEGATIONS

30:35.464 --> 30:37.266
THAT YOU TWO WERE LOVERS?

30:37.266 --> 30:40.169
HERE'S MY RESPONSE
TO YOU, MR. TREADWELL--

30:40.169 --> 30:42.111
IF YOU PRINT A WORD
OF THAT GARBAGE,

30:42.111 --> 30:44.573
I WILL SUE YOU FOR SLANDER.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.216
HE SAYS YOU WROTE HIM A NOTE
ON THE EVE OF HIS CONVICTION

30:47.216 --> 30:49.979
PROMISING TO GO
TO PROSECUTOR KINGSLY

30:49.979 --> 30:51.981
WITH INFORMATION
THAT WOULD EXONERATE HIM.

30:51.981 --> 30:53.953
CLEARLY NO SUCH THING
CAME TO PASS.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.985
SO YOU'RE DENYING
THE EXISTENCE OF THAT NOTE?

30:55.985 --> 30:58.187
AND THAT'S THE END
OF THE INTERVIEW.

30:58.187 --> 30:59.158
(button clicks)

30:59.158 --> 31:00.429
BUT IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN.

31:00.429 --> 31:02.191
DAVID CLARKE'S OBVIOUSLY
USING YOU

31:02.191 --> 31:04.233
TO TRY AND SELL
HIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY

31:04.233 --> 31:07.596
IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH
SOME SORT OF APPEAL.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.999
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
ANY REPORTER WORTH HIS SALT

31:09.999 --> 31:11.170
WOULD RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATELY.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.571
WE'LL HAVE NO PART OF IT.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.943
AS YOU WISH.

31:13.943 --> 31:15.404
BUT I'M GOING TO WRITE
THIS STORY

31:15.404 --> 31:17.146
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR INPUT.

31:17.146 --> 31:18.877
FEEL FREE TO SUE ME.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.179
MY ONLY ASSET
IS AN ANSWERING MACHINE

31:20.179 --> 31:22.551
BRIMMING OVER WITH LIVID
MESSAGES FROM MY CREDITORS.

31:22.551 --> 31:26.515
YOU SEE, I HAVE NOTHING
TO LOSE, MR. AND MRS. GRAYSON.

31:26.515 --> 31:29.518
WHILE YOU, IT WOULD APPEAR,

31:29.518 --> 31:32.191
HAVE PLENTY.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.624
JUST A MOMENT,
MR. TREADWELL.

31:38.027 --> 31:41.600
PERHAPS THERE IS AN ARRANGEMENT
THAT CAN BE MADE AFTER ALL.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.308
THE PEOPLE I BRING
INTO MY INNER CIRCLE

31:49.308 --> 31:51.210
WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.282
YOU WILL REMAIN IN THAT CIRCLE

31:53.282 --> 31:55.584
AS LONG AS YOU HOLD UP
YOUR AGREEMENT.

31:55.584 --> 31:57.386
IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO,

31:57.386 --> 32:00.319
I GUARANTEE THAT THOSE MEMOIRS
YOU'RE SO PROUD OF

32:00.319 --> 32:03.993
WILL END
IN A VERY DARK CHAPTER.

32:07.456 --> 32:09.458
"IT WAS NEARLY 15 YEARS

33:50.729 --> 33:52.461
SINCE "PHANTOM MENACE"?

33:52.461 --> 33:54.463
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK
HE'D COME CLEAN, DID YOU?

33:54.463 --> 33:55.804
WELL, DIDN'T YOU?

33:55.804 --> 33:58.237
NO. VICTORIA HAS
TOO MUCH POWER OVER HIM.

33:58.237 --> 33:59.468
THEN...

33:59.468 --> 34:01.670
WHY GO TO THE TROUBLE
OF HAVING AMANDA THREATEN HIM?

34:01.670 --> 34:03.472
I HAVE MY REASONS.

34:03.472 --> 34:05.514
OH.

34:05.514 --> 34:07.276
SPILL.

34:08.476 --> 34:10.549
YOU JUST NEED
TO TAKE HIM TO DINNER.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.152
TELL HIM YOU WANT TO HIRE HIM
TO WRITE YOUR BIOGRAPHY

34:13.152 --> 34:15.324
AND TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE
OUT OF THE WAY.

34:15.324 --> 34:16.824
I'M GONNA NEED TIME.

GIVE HIM YOUR BLESSING,
