- Dicky, why would you post

19:48.834 --> 19:50.959
that picture?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.542

19:51.000 --> 19:54.542
that good, you'd post it too.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.208

five minutes to do this,

What about our pig?

20:04.166 --> 20:05.917
this angry girl

20:05.959 --> 20:07.709
keeps calling my pig hers?

20:07.750 --> 20:10.834
- It doesn't matter anyway,

20:07.750 --> 20:10.834
because Dad ate the pig!

20:07.750 --> 20:10.834
- What?

20:10.875 --> 20:12.417
- I didn't eat the pig!

Oh, no.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.709
I picked up the pig's shirt.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.208

20:23.750 --> 20:26.208
in his mouth.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.542
- Well, that was

20:26.250 --> 20:28.542
just a curly fry.

20:28.583 --> 20:31.375
where's our pig?

20:31.417 --> 20:34.041
- Okay, why does she keep saying

20:31.417 --> 20:34.041
it's theirs?

20:34.083 --> 20:38.500
- Because it kind of maybe

20:34.083 --> 20:38.500
just a little is theirs?

20:38.542 --> 20:40.667
- What?

20:38.542 --> 20:40.667

We just wanted revenge.
