00:01.251 --> 00:03.544
How long have
you been a firefighter?
Since the day I was born.

00:03.712 --> 00:04.962
Previously on
Chicago Fire.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.214
Come on.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.635
Do you maybe wanna
hook up for a beer?

00:10.803 --> 00:12.762
Peter Mills, are you gay?
Me? No.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.681
Because I am.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.849
I don't sleep at night
when he's on shift.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.143
I'll look after him.
I promise.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.689
There's a surgery
which can take pressure
off the nerve.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.524
You're lucky that
you can feel pain at all.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.275
If I have to eat the pain,
then I will.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.779
How long you been
dating this guy?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.447
He's taken.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.076
She's going!
She's going!

00:35.244 --> 00:36.327
Arrest this idiot.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.663
Detective Voight,
that was his son
driving this car.

00:38.831 --> 00:39.789
What would
you have done?

00:39.957 --> 00:42.250
If I held that information
out of the report,

00:42.418 --> 00:45.545
I thought about how
I'd feel looking
you in the eye.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.506
You are gonna retract
that statement.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.674
What you're asking me
to do...

00:49.842 --> 00:51.259
I'm not asking!

00:58.809 --> 01:00.727
Hello?
Just checking in.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.103
I'm fine.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.397
Really.
I should be
checking on you.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.816
Not a care
in the world.
Turn here.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.736
Some gang cop breaks
into our cars and you don't
have a care in the world?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.196
That's right.
Just another day.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.116
I want it noted for the
record that I don't believe
a word you're saying.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.493
Good thing
you're a doctor
and not a lawyer

01:17.661 --> 01:19.162
'cause I'm just gonna
let this blow over.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.997
I'll call you later.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.252
I'll just be a minute.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.587
Lieutenant.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.063
Sir? You can't
go in there. Sir?

01:50.068 --> 01:53.070
Listen, I have a visitor.
I'll get back to you.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.948
Stay away from me.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.367
Excuse me?
I'm telling you
to back off!

01:59.036 --> 02:02.246
I'm telling you and
whatever garbage you
have working under you

02:02.414 --> 02:03.873
to stay the hell
away from us.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.792
Sir, I don't know
what this department did.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.001
I mean it.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.840
Get your ass outta
my office before I throw
you through that window.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.801
The threats don't
work, Voight.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.970
I'm not some scared
banger begging for
a look the other way.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.555
Know this,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.517
I'm not retracting
my statement.

02:23.018 --> 02:23.893
Ever.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.067
What?
You're all afraid
of this guy?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.318
Huh?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.030
Someone tell me why!

02:44.748 --> 02:47.542
All right, come on,
get back to work.
Show's over.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.049
Truck 81.
Factory accident,
Ogden and Ash.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.350
Drive.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.145
He's over here.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.939
Move out of the way.
Move! Move!

03:12.818 --> 03:13.776
How we doing?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.404
I just
need some help
getting it out.

03:16.572 --> 03:17.738
Okay, well,
just stay with us.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.616
The power's off.
It's locked out.
Holy cow.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.826
Bone saw.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.788
What do we got?
Excuse me.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.456
Trapped arm.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.667
How you feeling?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.627
Not so good,
to tell you the truth.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.421
That's a lot of blood.

03:33.589 --> 03:34.505
What's your name, hon?

03:34.673 --> 03:35.590
- Garrett.
- Garrett?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.300
How long
you been stuck, hon?

03:37.718 --> 03:38.634
I don't know.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.928
How long's
he been stuck?
Going on 15.

03:45.934 --> 03:46.851
There we go.

03:47.019 --> 03:47.935
We gotta get
him out now.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.395
All right, I loosened
it up a bit.
Good.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.648
We're just gonna put
some morphine in,
all right? Just a minute.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.317
You good?
Mmm-hmm.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.530
All right, sweetie,
I gave you some morphine.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.698
You should feel
better soon, okay?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.950
Garrett, we're gonna
try to ease
your arm now, okay?

04:05.162 --> 04:08.205
Here we go.
One, two, three!

04:10.959 --> 04:11.709
No!

04:11.877 --> 04:13.961
Stop! I can't! I can't!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.640
No! No!
God, I can't!

04:25.807 --> 04:27.475
Gear segments
come right off.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.518
Wait. If we get
the gears off,

04:29.686 --> 04:31.145
we can separate the casing
and travel with it.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.482
We need power drills,
1/4 inch hex,
an Allen key.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.068
Mills, do the gears.
Here you go,
Lieutenant.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.947
Okay?

04:41.531 --> 04:42.907
God.
Let me in.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.451
Damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.828
Okay.
God!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.373
Come on.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.968
Watch out, buddy.
Come on, Mills.
Support it, support it.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.594
Ready?
Gurney's coming in, guys.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.222
Okay.
Back up, back up,
back up.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.641
Clear?
We're clear.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.642
- Okay.
- You good?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.227
Take it.
Got it.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.562
Oh, God!
Watch it, watch it.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.065
Got it, got it.
Sit down, sweetie.
Sit down. Sit down.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.483
Do his legs.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.361
Just lay down.
Lay down.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.782
All right, let's get
him out of here.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.618
Casey, Severide,
we need you guys.
We gotta get this rig off.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.869
Yeah!

05:34.918 --> 05:36.252
God!

05:36.420 --> 05:38.504
Grab the IV
and set it to five ml drip.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.133
We need 4x4s
to stop this bleeding
and call Lakeshore...

05:42.300 --> 05:44.552
Oh!
You all right?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.388
I didn't sleep well.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.598
Hey, let's go.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.735
Possible crush syndrome,
gave four of morphine,

06:00.902 --> 06:03.654
heart rate 130,
his BP 110 palp,
two liters of saline.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.322
Call my boss,
tell him...

06:05.490 --> 06:06.741
Tell him that
I'll be there tomorrow,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.576
so don't worry about

06:08.744 --> 06:09.869
covering my shift.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.203
Dude really
loves his job.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.831
Ready on three.
One, two, three.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.667
Oh, God!

06:22.507 --> 06:23.966
He's out.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.885
Tourniquet's on.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.470
And we're ready here.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.930
All right, let's get
this thing off.

06:37.856 --> 06:38.939
Okay.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.441
This piece should
just slide out.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.984
Here. Ready?
Yeah.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.739
- Thank you.
- Ease his arm.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.616
Sweet Jesus.
I'll grab it. I got it.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.743
Type and cross
four units stat.
I need compression.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.329
Get him to OR 5.
Go, go, go.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.708
What a way
to start the day.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.959
Not exactly.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.088
Good to see
you, Hallie.
You too.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.634
Well?

07:06.802 --> 07:08.677
I went to the CPD
this morning.

07:08.845 --> 07:09.887
Talked to Voight.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.723
You two talked it out?

07:12.891 --> 07:13.891
No.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.310
I yelled.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.022
Hey.
Hey.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.108
Don't suppose you
could point me
towards the Toradol?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.901
I might have twisted
my shoulder again.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.611
You're dreaming.
All right, don't point.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.696
Just look toward it.
I'll do the rest.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.996
You don't
have to do it yourself.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.957
Then who else
is gonna do it?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.291
The system...

07:39.459 --> 07:40.376
We ready?

07:40.544 --> 07:43.045
I want you
to come home to me...

07:43.213 --> 07:44.547
Whatever.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.343
So wait, this
bioactive refreshment

07:49.511 --> 07:52.596
can only be found on what,
Chebeague Island?

07:52.764 --> 07:55.432
No, genius,
it starts there in
a natural spring.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.853
They infuse it
with the protein
and enzymes after

07:59.020 --> 08:00.855
in a laboratory.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.899
Listen, all I know
is this kid that
I grew up with

08:04.067 --> 08:05.776
is making a mint
hocking this stuff.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.946
You should see
his status reports on
Facebook or whatnot.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.157
I'm sure he's got
a brand new Mercedes
and a hot wife.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.242
- Something like that.
- Hey.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.451
Where's Casey?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.412
Guy got his arm
buried in a machine,

08:16.580 --> 08:19.582
so he went with
Shay and Dawson to
the hospital to unbury it.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.668
You guys know
anything about a visit
to the CPD today?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.880
Yeah, we made
a stop coming back
from Caldwell.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.007
Said he needed
to talk to somebody.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.343
Okay.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.056
That's pretty
good, actually.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.225
Yeah, sells itself.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.895
I got plenty more, guys.
Drink up.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.154
You were good under there,
with that machine.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.783
Thanks.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.917
Dawson,

09:04.002 --> 09:06.295
a little thank-you
from the paramedics
regulatory board

09:06.463 --> 09:08.923
for saving
that Madeline girl
last month.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.633
That's your copy.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.095
Unbelievable.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.681
"This serves as
an acknowledgment

09:17.849 --> 09:19.141
"that you have read
and understood

09:19.309 --> 09:22.102
"why this written
reprimand was issued."

09:23.063 --> 09:25.231
Dawson, I've said it once,
I'll say it again.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.982
You did the right thing,
you know that.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.859
That girl would
have died.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.446
Hey, it's barely
a slap on the wrist.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.822
I know Carla over there.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.492
I'll make sure
this goes right into
her circular file.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.119
Thanks, Mouch.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.794
Oh, chives in the eggs.
My day is getting
better already.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.629
Thank you. Look.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.465
Hot sauce?
Ugh. Sorry.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.676
Lieutenant Casey,
you eating?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.010
No.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.929
Casey,

09:57.097 --> 09:58.055
come with me.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.771
The allegations
are unfounded.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.939
Unfounded?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.858
I'm sorry, Chief Grogan,
this has got Voight's name
written all over it.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.235
There are no witnesses

10:11.403 --> 10:14.780
that detective Voight
was anywhere but on
the job Halloween night.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.324
Do you know how many tires
got slashed that day?

10:17.492 --> 10:19.243
Fifteen years
he worked Gang Unit.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.245
You don't think he's got
a few locals who can
do his dirty work?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.039
And that is exactly why
we have Internal Affairs

10:24.207 --> 10:25.874
and the ASA's office
investigating.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.793
But I gotta tell you,

10:27.961 --> 10:31.130
without a direct link,
what do you suggest
we do, Chief Boden?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.881
I suggest you handle
your precinct.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.008
Wait just a damn minute.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.845
My lieutenant and his fiancée
are being harassed.
Don't you tell me to wait.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.265
Forget it, Chief.
CPD isn't gonna help.

10:43.018 --> 10:43.934
I'll do it my own way.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.269
Casey, no.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.107
Give me
a better alternative.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.569
Something.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.534
I'll be the primary.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.831
IA, ASA,
they got fish frying
all over the city.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.333
I'll take
the lead on this.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.543
That's fine by me.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.754
We good here?

11:15.925 --> 11:17.509
Yeah, we're good.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.647
Anna, hey,
it's Kelly Severide.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.566
Sorry I haven't called
you back sooner.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.652
I changed cell phone numbers
and it was a big hassle.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.738
Anyway,

11:38.365 --> 11:39.948
look forward
to hearing from
you. Um,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.827
give me a call back
when you have a chance.

12:03.431 --> 12:08.644
Squad 3, Truck 94.
Construction accident,
6248 South Francisco.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.406
Help!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.492
I can't hold him!

12:23.660 --> 12:25.786
Hurry! Help me!

12:26.538 --> 12:27.663
He's slipping!

12:27.831 --> 12:28.747
I can't hold out!
Help!

12:28.915 --> 12:30.457
I'll need your aerial
on the other side
of the church.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.875
Do the best you can,
we'll do the rest.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.545
- Let's gear up.
- I can't hold it!

12:34.712 --> 12:37.548
Vargas, when they lock it
down, have the rope bag
at the ladder ready to go.

12:37.715 --> 12:38.715
Got it.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.634
Get that truck
over there!
Let's go!

12:49.644 --> 12:51.854
I can't!
I can't hold him!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.897
Help! Please!

13:14.711 --> 13:15.627
Talk to me.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.172
He's slipping.
I'm loose!

13:18.339 --> 13:19.798
Try to stay still.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.722
Coming to you.
You hold tight now.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.099
I can't!
I can't hold him!

13:29.267 --> 13:31.310
Help! Please!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.483
All right, hang on me.
I can't move.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.692
Can you reach out
with your other arm?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.736
I can't move it, no.
It's my fault.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.613
It's all right.
Just be calm, okay?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.490
We're gonna get
both of you down.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.493
This blue line's for you.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.786
Gonna hook you up.
Take you down first.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.289
Line secure!

13:52.874 --> 13:54.333
Okay, you can
let go of him,
we've got it.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.171
No need to push off.
Small steps.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.173
Here we go.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.592
Keep it steady
up there, Hadley.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.639
He told me not
to walk along the top
and I didn't listen.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.974
What's your name?
It's Ty.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.267
All right,
well hold on, Ty.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.228
No, don't, don't, don't!
My leg! My leg!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.772
All the way to
the pavement.
You've got it.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.525
Give me your hand.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.782
Kelly!

14:27.867 --> 14:28.992
Hey, hang on!

14:31.412 --> 14:33.539
Hadley,
get that rope up here!

14:34.165 --> 14:35.749
Doing great,
doing great.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.755
All clear. Pick it up.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.216
Hang on.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.598
Ty, reach up.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.725
In my right leg pocket,
there's a knife.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.477
I can't.
Ty.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.938
Hey, listen to me.
You have to.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.481
Gotta lose
that extra weight.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.986
Come on.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.571
Ah!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.072
Cut the line.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.700
Watch out below!

15:18.543 --> 15:21.420
Ty, grab the line.
Clamp it to your harness.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.468
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.811
Okay, Hadley.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.189
Ty, just slow down
the rest of the way,
all right?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.542
I got you,
I got you.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.942
Hey, Lieutenant,

16:26.527 --> 16:29.321
just so you know,
I've completed all the
descent rescue training.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.115
When I think you're ready,
you'll be the first to know.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.825
Right,

16:33.993 --> 16:34.868
I just didn't want
you to waste...

16:35.036 --> 16:36.453
Hey!
...all your resources.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.121
Let it go.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.957
I've got other things
to worry about besides
your career track.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.063
Hey, Anna,
it's Kelly again.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.440
Listen, I really need
you to call me back.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.235
If I don't answer,
you can just
leave me a message.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.112
I'll get back
to you.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.780
Thanks.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.350
Red carpet treatment.
I like it.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.977
Mmm-hmm.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.020
My dad wants to know
when he can put
his snow blower

17:44.188 --> 17:45.564
back in the garage.
Oh, yeah?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.066
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.526
We'll be running
through that water

17:49.694 --> 17:52.112
faster than a blizzard
in December. Trust me.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.657
Just don't put
too much pressure on
this idea, please?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.659
We'll be okay.
We're getting
a house, Cindy.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.077
The kids need
their own space.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.997
We need our own
space, hmm?
Mmm-hmm.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.166
Tell your dad to
sell that metal lathe.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.918
There'll be plenty
of room in there.
Don't even mention the lathe.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.047
Your mom uses it
as a drying rack.
Don't.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.550
Anyone home?
No.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.177
Get over here.
Oh!

18:45.041 --> 18:46.374
There's no cracked ribs.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.502
You're next in line
for the CT scan.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.337
Will you sit up
for me?
Yeah.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.513
I need you to take
some deep breaths, okay?
Okay.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.475
Again.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.987
It sounds clear.
That's good.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.697
You can lay back.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.617
Casey, how are you?

19:23.955 --> 19:25.413
So, no faces
for these guys?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.458
Markings?
Anything distinguishable?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.671
One of them
had a tattoo.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.090
Forearm.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.050
Left? Right?

19:37.802 --> 19:38.677
Left.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.555
Oh God, maybe right.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.931
Think.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.724
I am thinking!

19:49.564 --> 19:50.730
All right.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.734
All right,
rest for a few.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.198
Matt. Matt!

20:02.118 --> 20:05.579
Believe me, I know what
you're going through and
I know what you're thinking.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.665
But we are gonna
figure out how to
do this the right way.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.127
Do you hear me?

20:14.797 --> 20:15.672
Yeah.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.550
Okay.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.770
Okay, talk to me.
What are you gonna do?

20:30.938 --> 20:33.607
For starters, we gotta
identify at least
one of the attackers.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.691
It doesn't matter.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.152
It was that detective
yanking those
kids' strings.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.653
I'm sure it was.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.488
But if I can't connect
the hitters to Voight,

20:40.656 --> 20:42.240
and Voight
knows this better
than anyone,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.242
we don't have a thing.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.203
What can we
do now, Chief?

20:47.371 --> 20:48.747
Well, I'll tell you
what I'd do.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.042
Grab a Halligan
and ring that son of
a bitch's doorbell.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.879
You guys, you keep
your eyes forward
and you stay out of it.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.507
Support your lieutenant.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.760
Have his back, that's it.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.678
Think the chief's right.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.891
I am not gonna sit back
and take it.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.060
I'm not saying
that you should.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.937
But you make
one wrong decision

21:12.104 --> 21:13.104
and suddenly
you're the bad guy

21:13.272 --> 21:14.940
and that's exactly
what he wants.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.572
Promise me
you'll be careful.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.866
Promise.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.786
I promise.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.471
Oh, my God.
How long's the wait?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.974
What?
Did I screw up
that 'do of yours?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.392
No more than
you usually do.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.937
Oh, now you're just
begging for a long wait.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.232
Can I see you
for a minute?

21:59.110 --> 22:00.694
Be right back, DJ.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.534
I got me a problem
with a cop.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.327
White cop.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.788
Not the first time
I've heard that complaint
around here.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.082
He's a dirty cop,
Terrance.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.459
I need me someone
who'll wear a wire.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.006
Dirty white cop.

22:23.884 --> 22:24.759
I'm into it.

22:30.808 --> 22:31.891
Hey.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.604
I about died
when your name came up
on my phone.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.232
Yeah? Well,
I'm glad you didn't.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.692
Are you still
fighting fires?

22:40.860 --> 22:41.985
Yeah, most of
the time.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.988
We were good together.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.865
Am I right?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.535
Yeah, sure.
We had our moments.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.954
For a while.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.623
The coat room
at the Drake.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.918
Definitely a moment.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.257
I have a favor
to ask you, Anna.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.887
I knew there was
gonna be a catch.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.474
I'm staying at
the Peninsula.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.851
Conference BS
for the next three days.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.395
Pick a night,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.105
and ask me for
your favor then.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.822
What's up, Herrmann?

23:27.990 --> 23:28.656
Nada.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.326
Yeah? You look like
your dog just died.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.828
That's just insensitive.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.248
All right, look.
It's just when I...

23:37.416 --> 23:38.917
Hey, Lieutenant.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.004
You should take
a few more days, Casey.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.297
Well within your rights.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.841
Eh, I'd just be
staring at the ceiling.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.426
I'm going to look
at mug shots.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.137
Speaking of,
where do you
wanna do this?

23:52.014 --> 23:55.141
The guys who
assaulted you have
a record, guaranteed.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.727
Means they've been
processed and we have
those tatts on file.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.771
See if you can recall
one of those.

24:01.482 --> 24:04.734
Oh, sorry to interrupt.
I'm just grabbing my stuff.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.612
Hey, any progress?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.030
We'll get there.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.573
Unless you got
a magic wand on you.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.873
I gotta...
I gotta take it.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.334
Hi.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.753
I, um,
I'm just holding
to our agreement.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.964
I'm checking
in with you.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.132
You okay?

24:27.883 --> 24:29.926
Just looking
at photographs

24:30.970 --> 24:32.846
of tattoos.
You never know.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.681
That's right.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.600
I love you.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.689
I love you too.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.946
Do this the right way,

24:50.406 --> 24:52.615
or I may have to
come down there.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.537
So maybe
the right way
isn't so right.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.081
Maybe not.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.045
Ambulance 61,
head injury, northwest
corner of Hyde Park.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.214
Go get 'em.
Mmm-hmm.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.509
What's his name?

25:11.677 --> 25:12.927
What the hell difference
does it make?

25:13.095 --> 25:15.096
His name's Vince.
Fix him!

25:15.848 --> 25:17.098
Vince,
can you hear me?

25:17.266 --> 25:19.893
All right,
if you can hear me,
don't move, blink twice.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.769
C-collar.
Yeah.

25:22.980 --> 25:23.897
How long are you
gonna leave him
lying there?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.481
Get him in the damn
ambulance already!

25:25.649 --> 25:26.900
What happened?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.526
We rode it off
down this ramp,

25:28.694 --> 25:30.653
we flipped,
he hit first.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.494
You're on something, huh?
What are you on?

25:39.163 --> 25:40.955
You need to shut up.
Fix him, not me.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.250
Come on.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.837
Here we go, on three.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.631
One... Three.
Two...

25:54.970 --> 25:56.179
We'll see you
at the hospital.
Lakeshore.

25:56.347 --> 25:57.555
I'm going with him.
No, you're not.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.098
This ain't
up to you, lady.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.645
On behalf of the
Paramedics Association
of America,

26:03.812 --> 26:06.564
I offer my sincerest
apologies for
the forceful actions

26:06.732 --> 26:07.941
I exhibited here today.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.131
My God!
I missed that.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.554
I need a favor, Anna.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.558
Can we
just order a little
room service first?

26:42.726 --> 26:45.353
You asked me
to meet you here,
and I did.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.981
Fine, go ahead.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.149
You want a favor.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.943
Let's hear it.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.446
I need something...

26:56.198 --> 26:57.365
Okay?

26:58.075 --> 26:59.617
Something strong.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.037
Ah!

27:03.205 --> 27:04.998
Whoo.
What is that?

27:05.499 --> 27:07.792
That is my leftovers.
Chicken mac and cheese.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.252
Whoa! Hey!
No, no, no.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.963
That smell,
I can't be held responsible.

27:18.012 --> 27:18.928
Where'd you get this?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.722
Oh, screw you, Mills.
I made it.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.806
Okay, well,
name the ingredients.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.017
I'm not gonna
tell you that.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.394
It's handed down
from my grandmother.
Hey!

27:26.562 --> 27:28.604
It's a secret.
I will figure it out.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.816
Many have tried,
young Peter Mills.
All have failed.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.028
Come on. Let me get
one more bite at least.

27:35.195 --> 27:38.281
What! You accepted
the shipment?

27:38.699 --> 27:40.533
No, it's okay.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.702
Just don't open
any of them.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.038
I'll deal with it
when I get back.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.873
Thank you.

27:47.708 --> 27:51.794
In-laws are single
handedly cutting my life
expectancy in half.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.755
What is going on
with you?

27:54.465 --> 27:56.716
Just hanging on
for dear life.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.676
Spill it.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.974
I have cases
of this damned
energy water

28:05.142 --> 28:06.642
sitting in
my in-laws' garage,

28:06.810 --> 28:09.937
and I'm never
gonna be able
to off-load.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.232
I'm in for a grand already,
and they just keep coming.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.612
They call it
multi-level marketing,
but it's a pyramid scheme.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.823
And I don't know
what I'm gonna tell Cindy.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.241
So return it.

28:23.494 --> 28:24.786
It's non-refundable.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.915
Non-refundable
is a word made up
by lawyers.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.876
I signed a contract.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.504
Give me the number.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.304
That is absurd!

28:44.515 --> 28:47.975
Well, then, fine.
I guess you'll know where
to find me. On the job!

28:49.978 --> 28:50.937
What was all
that about?

28:51.105 --> 28:54.440
That frat kid,
he filed a complaint
with the City.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.652
Oh, the kid's just
embarrassed. No way he'll
ever follow through on that.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.820
Well, he just did, Shay.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.697
Well, that's ridiculous,
and screw them.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.282
You know
I would have done
the same thing.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.618
Well, you didn't.
I did.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.579
And that makes two,
for everyone keeping score.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.210
County said that they
could suspend me this time.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.925
Ambulance 61.
Altered mental status,
West Madison Street.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.301
Dawson.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.222
I rerouted that call to 34.
Dawson, I need to see you.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.558
Come on.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.857
Reckless infliction
of emotional distress?
Are you kidding me?

29:36.024 --> 29:37.733
You have a bit of
a track record lately,
wouldn't you say?

29:37.901 --> 29:39.527
Apples and oranges.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.697
Except both involve
me saving a life.
Which I did.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.324
Both involve violations
in a very short time span.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.534
That...
But...

29:46.702 --> 29:49.954
This isn't enough
to warrant suspension,
Chief. No way.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.831
Well, be ready
for the possibility.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.833
And be
absolutely certain that
your memory of the event

29:54.001 --> 29:55.126
is accurate to
the best of
your knowledge.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.629
Like what? That I kicked
the belligerent jackass
with one foot or two?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.215
Is there a date set
for this hearing?

30:02.718 --> 30:03.676
Not at the moment.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.553
There won't
be one, Chief.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.473
This will be
a written warning
just like the other.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.516
One call.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.560
Well, whatever
you need to do.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.562
You take care of this.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.863
It's fine.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.080
I have someone.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.750
I know a guy who lives
in Voight's neighborhood

30:35.918 --> 30:38.544
who knows a kid who's
willing to wear a wire.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.254
We're gonna meet him
at the end of the shift.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.793
Evening, ma'am.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.297
Got you rolling
through a stop
back there.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.550
What stop?

31:26.802 --> 31:29.095
I can let it go
with a warning
this time.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.431
Just do me a favor.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.560
Talk some sense
into your man.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.146
Excuse me?

31:39.314 --> 31:42.608
I'd really hate
to see things get uglier
than they already are.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.572
Thank you, Hallie.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.032
Have a good night.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.590
So what's
the process here?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.842
If the kid's willing
to go on tape,
we'll set up a sting.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.803
Hey, baby.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.682
What's wrong?
Everything all right?

32:16.852 --> 32:20.855
I get it. Just why didn't
you call me last night
when it happened?

32:23.442 --> 32:24.734
Manager.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.862
Man-a-ger.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.492
Speak... To...
Manager.

32:35.829 --> 32:36.746
Yes.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.879
Come on,
let's get out of here.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.930
Where do you...
Where do you wanna go?

32:57.809 --> 32:58.976
Someplace loud?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.896
We can go to Jenson's?
They have good music.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.816
Wanna go someplace quiet,
get coffee?

33:07.277 --> 33:09.028
Library maybe?

33:09.196 --> 33:11.697
Want to peruse
a novel

33:12.366 --> 33:14.784
or flip through
some microfilm?

33:14.951 --> 33:17.495
Do they even make
microfilm anymore?

33:19.581 --> 33:21.290
I think I already
have a plan.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.752
Yeah? What?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.963
I'm gonna cook.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.010
Well, the terms of
the note are misrepresented.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.471
Why, yes,
I am an attorney.
Are you?

33:35.639 --> 33:36.597
No...

33:36.765 --> 33:38.808
Oh, you're
in marketing.
Perfect.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.601
So you should know
that the basic premise

33:40.769 --> 33:42.645
of a pyramid scheme
was found to be illegal

33:42.813 --> 33:45.147
in accordance
with the case of
Landers v. Holcroft 1985.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.235
And so if you are
illegally refusing

33:49.403 --> 33:51.654
my client's rights
on page one, trust me,

33:51.822 --> 33:55.616
it's not getting any better
on pages 10, 11
or 12, guaranteed.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.202
I do this for
a living, sir.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.372
All it's gonna cost me
are the filing fees.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.498
That's right.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.584
Small Claims,
Better Business Bureau.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.628
I can turn this
into a real
three-ring circus

34:07.796 --> 34:09.839
and not lose
a minute of sleep.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.842
I am gonna drain
your pockets of
10 grand so fast,

34:13.009 --> 34:16.637
all the fake energy water
in the world
won't rehydrate them.

34:16.805 --> 34:17.805
Uh-huh.

34:18.807 --> 34:19.890
Yes.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.977
Overnight it, please.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.191
They wanna know
where to send the refund.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.698
Non-refundable.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.035
Hello?

34:40.954 --> 34:41.829
Yeah.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.832
You seen Vargas?
Yeah, he's heading in.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.543
Oh, hey, you got a phone
call a few minutes ago,
by the way. Some woman.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.837
Name was Anna?
Oh, okay, thanks.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.882
Hey, Vargas,
grab your rappelling gear.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.759
What?
Shift's ending.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.136
You heard me.

35:03.894 --> 35:04.977
This is Darell.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.812
This is Detective Dawson.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.898
What have you
got for us, kid?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.608
Voight bad, man.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.860
Whole West Side
up and down know
to step back.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.488
You done favors
for him?
Yeah.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.656
Hell, enough
to get tight.
Yeah?

35:18.241 --> 35:19.742
What's he told you?

35:19.910 --> 35:22.536
Mess with the lady,
expect a payday.

35:22.704 --> 35:23.871
But go after you?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.374
He said he'd take
care of all of us.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.793
"Anything you need,"
he said.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.295
Get out of jail
free passes for me
and some others.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.340
So you'll wear a wire?

35:34.508 --> 35:35.966
Hell, yeah.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.969
When did Voight
reach out last?

35:39.930 --> 35:40.971
Two weeks ago.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.682
Two weeks?

35:46.102 --> 35:46.894
Maybe a week.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.981
Which is it?

35:51.900 --> 35:52.900
A week then.

35:54.736 --> 35:55.861
Whatever you want it
to be you tell me.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.363
This guy's full of it.

35:57.531 --> 35:59.156
Look, I get paid,

35:59.324 --> 36:00.908
I get you what you want.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.661
Everybody makes out.
Problems go away.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.329
It's capitalism, man.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.997
Get the hell out of here.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.457
It ain't gotta be
like that.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.209
I said get the hell out.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.211
Right.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.464
I thought he was legit.

36:18.552 --> 36:19.885
Casey!

36:23.723 --> 36:25.015
Sorry for the wait,
Peter Mills.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.017
Bon appétit.
Thank you.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.606
So good.
Good luck.

36:32.774 --> 36:33.816
Yeah?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.238
Mmm.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.242
Chicken, rotisserie.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.452
Mmm-hmm.
Bacon, red peppers,

36:45.871 --> 36:48.998
sweet onions,
a tablespoon of butter?

36:49.165 --> 36:50.916
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Uh, oil, olive oil.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.084
Yeah.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.588
Uh...

36:57.966 --> 36:59.049
Gruyere cheese?
Yeah.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.217
Yeah?
And parmesan...

37:00.385 --> 37:02.303
No, please don't spot me.
I can get it.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.971
I gotta spot you 'cause
you're not gonna get it.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.056
What won't I get?
What am I missing?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.058
The thing that makes
it a family secret.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.184
Ah!
Ah!

37:09.352 --> 37:11.020
Tell me what it is.

37:11.605 --> 37:14.231
Look, I will tell
my mom to put it on
the menu tomorrow.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.400
We can call it
"Grandma Dawson's
mac and cheese."

37:16.568 --> 37:18.652
Come on.
Another one bites the dust.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.446
Oh. Bam.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.323
All right.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.213
Nutmeg.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.009
Nobody ever
gets that. Ever.
Ooh!

37:42.177 --> 37:44.219
Yes, yes!
How did you do that?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.971
You are lucky.
Nobody but me, baby.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.097
Oh, my God.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.058
That's just...
That's friggin' luck.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.601
That is talent.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.311
That is all that is.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.730
One sec.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.150
Mouch, what do you know?

37:59.444 --> 38:01.403
Yeah, I've got bad news.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.155
They've scheduled a hearing.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.991
I tried like hell
to fight it off,

38:06.159 --> 38:08.619
but that's the way
it stands.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.789
I'll call you later
with more.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.797
Mills, where do you
keep the liquor?

38:23.426 --> 38:25.386
There he is.
And time!

38:25.553 --> 38:27.805
6.42, ladies.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.765
He obliterated
your old time.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.601
Get up here.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.311
I'm not helping
his ass up here.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.732
Now sit your ass down,
Vargas. You earned it.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.405
Welcome to Squad.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.202
Before breakfast?
After shift.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.957
Have a seat.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.170
Did you ever
call Anna back?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.422
Nah.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.341
Oh, now I remember.
Anna.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.761
Yeah, she was
a pharmaceutical rep
or something like that.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.556
Was she? I don't...
We never talked.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.905
I know I shouldn't have
called the firehouse.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.032
Here.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.702
Thank you.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.162
Be careful with these.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.622
Take them only
when necessary.
I will.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.043
I'm in town
two more days.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.713
Cool.
I'll let you know.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.087
What?

41:10.844 --> 41:12.177
Give it to me.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.355
I'm only gonna
tell you one more
time, Casey.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.400
Give it to me.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.500
Go on and
get out of here.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.793
Go home.
