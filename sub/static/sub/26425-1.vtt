01:54.915 --> 01:57.649
Yo Mark, hey, I left
some oranges out here

01:57.651 --> 01:59.252
for you last night.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.190
Sorry man, hope I
didn't scare you.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.593
There's still no news

02:06.994 --> 02:08.961
and, yeah.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.428
And you know what?

02:10.430 --> 02:11.564
Hey, you're welcome inside
the house anytime, okay?

02:11.566 --> 02:13.836
Just knock first.

03:50.732 --> 03:51.566
Morning, Bill.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.234
Morning, Fred.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.003
Buenos Dias, Senor Gomez.

03:57.105 --> 04:00.605
Aw, morning, Maria.

04:00.607 --> 04:01.475
Damn.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.892
The
governor has mobilized

05:59.894 --> 06:02.594
the National Guard,
of which at least 35%

06:02.596 --> 06:04.796
are unable to report for duty.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.469
Monterey, Big Sur,
Modesto, Bakersfield...

06:09.503 --> 06:10.870
Guy, why no lights?

06:10.872 --> 06:12.537
We have the sunshine.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.542
Yeah, we also have lights.

06:15.675 --> 06:16.875
The Southland continues

06:16.877 --> 06:18.810
to experience a
widespread outbreak,

06:20.882 --> 06:22.184
And no more coffee.

06:23.151 --> 06:24.286
That's great.

06:26.187 --> 06:27.452
Guy, where's my good knife?

06:27.454 --> 06:29.123
Where are all my good knives?

06:30.324 --> 06:32.190
I repurposed those
old magnets we had.

06:32.192 --> 06:32.825
When did you do that?

06:32.827 --> 06:34.325
Last night.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.161
Oh hey, check it out.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.199
Hot water.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.632
Look.

06:39.634 --> 06:41.933
Whoo, I told you it would work.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.936
Heated by some clever ingenuity
and a little mother nature.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.474
Next rainfall, we're set.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.116
Look what else I found.

06:54.949 --> 06:56.649
Batteries

06:56.651 --> 06:57.582
What for?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.318
I don't know, anything.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.387
I got them when
they were on sale.

07:01.389 --> 07:02.555
What size are they?

07:02.557 --> 07:04.455
Nine volt.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.327
Oh, man.

07:07.195 --> 07:09.227
Ugh, they're all expired

07:09.229 --> 07:13.267
Jesus Christ, play
some music for a change.

07:14.202 --> 07:15.269
It's okay, baby

07:18.438 --> 07:20.339
Honey, I'm sorry.

07:20.341 --> 07:22.440
There's no coffee
and I'm developing

07:22.442 --> 07:25.945
an intense hatred of oranges.

07:25.947 --> 07:26.911
We have figs.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.880
Yeah, and beans, Guy.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.349
Cans of beans.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.450
We also have those dried ones.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.357
What are they, the, lima
or navy bean or whatever?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.693
Look, I failed legume
identification class,

07:40.695 --> 07:43.764
but I think I can get a garden
going in that front room.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.265
You know, put some
dirt and those boxes,

07:47.267 --> 07:49.335
and there's easily enough light
out there to get one going.

07:49.337 --> 07:50.835
Yeah, if we can last
through tomato season,

07:50.837 --> 07:53.339
you're gonna have to shoot me,

07:53.341 --> 07:55.407
and please, can
you wear clothes?

07:55.409 --> 07:56.474
It doesn't matter anymore.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.476
Yes, it does.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.649
Just, at least wear pants, okay?

08:05.385 --> 08:06.585
Hey, look, see?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.685
I checked the fence.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.421
Okay, it's all good.

08:09.423 --> 08:10.923
It's fine.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.424
Choppers are still
buzzing around.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.359
I think one saw me this morning.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.394
Wait, what?

08:15.396 --> 08:16.428
Yeah.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.363
Why didn't you wake me up?

08:17.365 --> 08:18.563
Did you do a signal?

08:18.565 --> 08:20.431
Yes, I waived the
flag like crazy,

08:20.433 --> 08:22.835
but they just, they
weren't close enough.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.969
Next time, please wake me up.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.474
They'll be back, okay?

08:27.608 --> 08:28.944
I was just out there, and...

08:31.278 --> 08:32.346
What?

08:35.416 --> 08:36.284
Guy, what?

08:37.784 --> 08:38.751
Maria turned.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.591
Paige, oh, goddammit.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.428
Come on.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.001
Paige.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.735
Maria?

08:56.737 --> 08:57.872
Paige.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.709
That's my bracelet.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.246
I let her borrow it.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.481
Paige, come on.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.619
Come on, baby.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.956
Nope, nope.

09:17.325 --> 09:18.425
It's not our fault.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.459
She should've been
in here, with us.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.363
They all should have.

09:23.531 --> 09:24.332
We tried.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.066
God, I hate this.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.033
Where are they?

09:28.035 --> 09:28.967
Why haven't they come yet?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.339
Isn't this exactly why we taxes?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
I think I'm gonna
take up painting.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.342
What do you think?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.409
Seriously?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.577
Yeah, why not?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.746
I mean, the air's getting
cleaner without all the traffic.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.015
Just sit out there and
just breathe it in.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.353
I'm getting so much
sleep, I feel great.

09:47.488 --> 09:49.454
I have all this creative energy.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.957
I feel fucking
creative, you know?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.328
I love my knife wall.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.596
Is this how you spent
your days, just waking up

09:57.598 --> 09:59.800
and I don't know, making shit?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.433
Are you okay if I use
your paints and stuff?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.872
I promise, I'll do
my chores first.

10:06.474 --> 10:07.541
Thank you, honey

12:46.599 --> 12:47.734
Hello?

17:38.458 --> 17:39.291
Hey, Guy?

17:39.293 --> 17:40.128
Mmm.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.132
What are these?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.133
I was cleaning out your desk.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.338
All right.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.071
- Done.
- What are you doing?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.272
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.877
It doesn't matter anymore.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.411
Do you think he's
alone in there?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.013
He always was before.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.181
Hey, we could snag
his plant collection.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.351
No, Guy, you're not
going in after his weed.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.486
That's stupid.

18:07.488 --> 18:10.892
Yeah, well, look, he's not
gonna get out, I promise.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.493
Well, I'm not sleeping
with him out there.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.330
I can't.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.399
Come on.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.401
Trust me.

18:24.071 --> 18:25.238
Don't you fuck this up.

18:28.609 --> 18:29.477
Shut up.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.846
What a jerk.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.291
Guy, I found
my other phone charger.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.059
If there's no internet,

18:48.061 --> 18:49.593
I seriously doubt they're
worried about cell towers.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.063
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
keep trying to do the,

18:52.065 --> 18:53.234
what're you doing?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.337
I'm deciding on what kind
of painter I want to be.

19:00.274 --> 19:01.672
What, my chores are done.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.940
Guy!

19:02.942 --> 19:03.577
They are!

19:17.090 --> 19:17.925
Guy, hey.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.993
Oh, I like it, honey.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.264
Ordered chaos.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.530
But you know what?

19:25.532 --> 19:26.363
I think if I'm gonna
start with still life,

19:26.365 --> 19:27.998
I think I want nature.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.800
You know, like the back yard

19:28.802 --> 19:31.236
is some kind of
like a modern Eden.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.338
Oh my God, you found
my Kurosawa sword.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.272
No, Guy, stop it.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.940
This is not a still life.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.043
We're into week three and
everything you see here,

19:38.045 --> 19:40.210
this is all we have
left in the house.

19:40.212 --> 19:43.047
No, we have
oranges, we have figs,

19:43.049 --> 19:44.949
we have plenty of water.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.151
Look, you didn't even
comment on my invention.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.053
We're gonna have
rainwater from the roof.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.255
We live in a desert.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.489
You know what?

19:52.491 --> 19:53.658
I've tasted your life
for a few days now.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.127
The no worries, no hassles,

19:56.129 --> 19:57.361
doing exactly doing
what you want to do,

19:57.363 --> 19:59.965
and I don't want to give it up
now, not if I don't have to.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.967
You think that I
sat around all day

20:01.969 --> 20:04.335
and just played
paint by numbers?

20:04.337 --> 20:07.037
No, Guy, there were phone
calls that I had to make

20:07.039 --> 20:10.274
and galleries I had to
pitch and a bunch of essays

20:10.276 --> 20:14.044
I had to write about why
I do blah blah bullshit

20:14.046 --> 20:15.447
as a contemporary painter.

20:15.449 --> 20:17.114
And for every single
person that said yes to me,

20:17.116 --> 20:19.484
50 said no, 100
people said no to me.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.119
That was my life
every single day,

20:21.121 --> 20:22.419
just a bunch of fucking
people saying no.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.156
Okay, so you want
to go back to that?

20:25.158 --> 20:26.026
No.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.293
Yes, I do.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.461
Maybe.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.467
Okay, and what about Mark, huh?

20:35.469 --> 20:37.736
He's not getting out.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.072
Do you hear that?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.240
See, see?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.044
Paige.

21:00.794 --> 21:02.159
See us!

21:02.161 --> 21:03.064
Fuck, see us!

21:04.131 --> 21:04.732
See us.

21:28.622 --> 21:29.489
Honey!

21:37.096 --> 21:38.362
Jesus.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.200
Honey!

21:46.305 --> 21:48.275
I'm not gonna sleep
with him like that.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.744
What do you want me to do?

21:51.678 --> 21:53.113
That's my Kurosawa sword.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.413
This is about survival.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.149
No, that's mine and you
shouldn't be touching it.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.583
Guy, eventually there's
gonna be so many of them

21:59.585 --> 22:00.752
that we're not
gonna keep them out.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.653
You're gonna kill my friend

22:02.655 --> 22:04.688
with my limited
edition Kurosawa sword?

22:04.690 --> 22:05.526
Yes!

22:08.260 --> 22:09.761
No, you're gonna do it.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.161
Oh, I am?

22:11.163 --> 22:11.862
Yeah!

22:11.864 --> 22:12.863
Oh, okay, and why my friend?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.134
Why not yours?

22:15.267 --> 22:16.234
Guy?

22:16.236 --> 22:17.669
No, why not?

22:17.671 --> 22:19.169
Guy, wait.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.170
Oh no, but this
is about survival.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.639
No, just wait.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.408
What, just because he's
dead, it doesn't matter?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.742
Come on, stop!

22:24.744 --> 22:26.244
Do it.

22:26.246 --> 22:27.748
Since it's so easy,
I want to see this.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.064
You have to cut off her
head, or at least smash it.

22:47.234 --> 22:49.303
Go, smash Maria's brains.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.229
Okay, yes, I get it.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.670
This shit's not even sharp.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.181
Don't cry, baby.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.251
I'm not crying.

23:38.951 --> 23:39.752
I just, shit.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.388
Guy, I don't feel anything.

23:43.390 --> 23:45.258
It's like we're already dead.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.060
Are you kidding?

23:48.562 --> 23:50.594
A month ago I was killing myself

23:50.596 --> 23:53.898
trying to keep this house,
trying to keep us afloat.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.701
I know.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.139
There's no stress here.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.973
I mean, there's no
mortgage, you know?

24:01.975 --> 24:03.774
No bills.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.275
No deadlines.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.344
No getting up at fucking
5:30 in the morning

24:07.346 --> 24:09.746
for some bullshit
client meeting downtown,

24:09.748 --> 24:12.483
that I don't have to
be there for anyway.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.851
I mean, there's no debt.

24:14.853 --> 24:15.719
Gone.

24:15.721 --> 24:16.553
Student loans?

24:16.555 --> 24:17.391
Yeah, gone.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.458
And babe, think
about all the things

24:21.460 --> 24:24.228
that we've wanted to do, right?

24:24.230 --> 24:27.232
All the books that you've never
finished reading, you know?

24:27.234 --> 24:30.334
All the time, all the time.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.769
I mean, fuck, every
night, you telling me

24:32.771 --> 24:34.238
that you don't have enough
time to get things done.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.473
How many times
have you said that?

24:35.475 --> 24:36.608
All the time.

24:36.610 --> 24:39.280
All the time, all the time.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.381
This is the best thing that
could've ever happened.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.384
Okay, okay, look, I know, it's
not the most ideal scenario,

24:47.386 --> 24:48.486
but, you know?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.325
If it was gonna happen anyway...

24:55.327 --> 24:56.460
You know what?

24:56.462 --> 24:58.598
We've got plenty of food,
we've got plenty of water.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.268
Guy!

25:38.971 --> 25:40.373
You killed Bill.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.075
Yeah, well he blew
shit into our yard

25:45.077 --> 25:47.312
all the time and he knows it.

25:47.314 --> 25:47.948
Honey.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.082
I married you because
if anything like this

25:52.084 --> 25:55.722
was ever gonna happen, I
wanted it to happen with you,

25:58.691 --> 25:59.892
so let's not leave.

26:51.411 --> 26:52.442
Yes!

27:22.808 --> 27:24.478
And you wanted
to sell my DVDs.

27:31.049 --> 27:34.185
Ugh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I can't.

27:34.187 --> 27:35.488
No more.

27:36.690 --> 27:41.461
Isn't there like a disease
that's the opposite of scurvy?

27:43.095 --> 27:47.130
Oh my God, I have
reverse scurvy.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.768
I know I have it.

27:49.869 --> 27:50.804
No.

27:52.572 --> 27:53.474
I think I do.

27:54.908 --> 27:56.677
I don't even know
what scurvy is.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.579
It's, like, a pirate thing.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.624
I'm still worried, you know?

28:12.758 --> 28:15.962
They'll let us
know when it's okay.

28:17.896 --> 28:18.830
We'll check every day.

28:18.832 --> 28:21.064
No, not just about that.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.968
You know how you said that
you have all this freedom now

28:24.970 --> 28:29.175
and all this time to just
do whatever we want and,

28:31.143 --> 28:32.512
I don't feel like painting.

28:33.246 --> 28:35.580
Like, not at all.

28:35.582 --> 28:36.617
Give it time.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.084
You will.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.524
You finished off that
whiskey, didn't you?

28:45.557 --> 28:46.559
Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.161
It's funny, I always
thought that paradise

28:51.163 --> 28:53.533
would have an open bar.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.873
I've decided I'm a Manet.

29:02.709 --> 29:03.975
Not Monet, but Manet.

29:03.977 --> 29:06.043
Yeah, I know the difference.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.044
I'm just letting you know
that I know the difference.

29:08.046 --> 29:10.049
Miss smarty pants, MFA painter.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.525
Nobody decides what kind
of artist they're gonna be,

29:19.625 --> 29:20.594
they just paint.

31:20.846 --> 31:21.681
Morning, Fred.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.584
Tough shit, Bill.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.820
Los siento, Señor Gomez

31:29.122 --> 31:31.224
Good morning, lady I don't know.

31:32.825 --> 31:35.295
Good morning, other
dude I don't know.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.728
Hey, honey?

32:14.433 --> 32:15.267
Honey?

32:16.969 --> 32:18.101
Yeah?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.105
Hey.

32:20.707 --> 32:25.178
For the first time in a
long time, I am taking a bath.

32:27.814 --> 32:29.979
You want company?

32:29.981 --> 32:30.816
No.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.320
You want music?

32:34.987 --> 32:35.785
Yeah, sure.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.823
Thank you.

32:37.824 --> 32:39.857
All right, I'll
be outside working.

32:39.859 --> 32:40.894
Okay.

33:23.068 --> 33:23.900
Ahhh.

33:26.139 --> 33:27.838
Guy?

33:27.840 --> 33:28.442
Sorry.

33:46.057 --> 33:46.691
Ha!

36:03.261 --> 36:04.430
Oh, come on.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.013
Guy?

36:51.143 --> 36:51.978
Ah.

37:23.509 --> 37:24.574
Guy?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.109
Oh, hey.

37:26.111 --> 37:27.710
I heard loud noises.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.381
Yeah, it was
probably just, uh,

37:30.515 --> 37:32.549
probably just stuff
falling off of stuff.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.716
Yeah, we're okay.

37:33.718 --> 37:34.650
The fence is tight.

37:34.652 --> 37:35.654
I checked the whole thing.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.158
You want to paint with me?

37:40.259 --> 37:41.094
No.

38:01.047 --> 38:02.212
Wahh.

39:56.594 --> 39:57.430
Hey.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.835
Since you're dressed for it,
how about a date tonight?

40:24.957 --> 40:26.522
Mmm.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.958
Wow, this looks really good.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.393
Oh, thank you.

40:29.395 --> 40:32.763
I made a balsamic
glaze reduction

40:32.765 --> 40:34.964
and I steamed the protein paste

40:34.966 --> 40:36.568
and then I made
some black beans.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.205
Thank you.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.214
Mmm.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.253
Did you forget
the wine glasses?

41:00.326 --> 41:01.694
Are you kidding me?

41:03.596 --> 41:07.364
Guy, oh my gosh.

41:07.366 --> 41:08.498
How did you get that?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.000
Careful, now, don't drop it.

41:10.002 --> 41:11.335
Where did you, you know what?

41:11.337 --> 41:13.237
I don't want to know.

41:13.239 --> 41:14.340
Just open it.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.384
Guy, I don't think we should.

41:27.419 --> 41:28.821
I ran out of pills.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.943
Maria, are you laughing?

41:51.410 --> 41:52.411
Ow!

42:03.055 --> 42:03.890
Hey.

42:05.390 --> 42:06.757
Namaste.

42:06.759 --> 42:10.426
Did you give Maria
that purse you got

42:10.428 --> 42:11.530
for the holiday party?

42:13.364 --> 42:15.868
Yeah, she always
really liked it.

42:17.335 --> 42:18.370
Huh.

42:19.370 --> 42:19.972
You okay?

42:22.341 --> 42:23.640
I'm great.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.676
Did you turn on
the radio today?

42:25.678 --> 42:30.683
No.

42:33.785 --> 42:36.722
The procedure...

42:52.738 --> 42:54.837
We can go in the bedroom.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.808
No, it's okay.

43:10.089 --> 43:10.922
Hey.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.924
It's late, we
should go to sleep.

43:14.926 --> 43:15.761
No.

43:17.462 --> 43:19.364
They're just my boots.

43:20.765 --> 43:23.533
I've been wanting a
pair of boots like that

43:23.535 --> 43:27.471
for so long and now I
can't even order them

43:27.473 --> 43:29.676
and I will never be able
to wear them somewhere.

43:32.477 --> 43:33.476
Don't you have
boots like that?

43:33.478 --> 43:35.612
No.

43:35.614 --> 43:38.384
Those are completely different.

43:43.589 --> 43:47.089
Am I a bitch for
crying about boots?

43:47.091 --> 43:47.924
No.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.125
I am.

43:49.127 --> 43:51.396
I'm a bitch for
crying about boots.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.533
I never wanted to be
one of those girls

43:56.535 --> 43:59.339
and now I am totally
one of those girls.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.504
You don't need boots.

44:01.506 --> 44:02.541
Fuck boots.

44:06.511 --> 44:08.844
Look at these girls.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.513
Look at this one.

44:10.515 --> 44:11.750
She doesn't look happy at all.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.650
She doesn't?

44:14.652 --> 44:15.488
No.

44:18.589 --> 44:19.855
Come on, baby.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.126
Let's go to bed.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.529
Come on.

44:29.535 --> 44:30.833
I love you, Guy.

44:30.835 --> 44:33.538
I love you, too.

44:47.618 --> 44:48.553
God dammit.

44:51.622 --> 44:52.922
Hey!

44:52.924 --> 44:53.759
It's ready

44:56.794 --> 44:59.131
And, ta-da!

45:05.571 --> 45:06.370
You see what it is?

45:06.372 --> 45:08.574
Look, you just
take an orange out

45:09.808 --> 45:11.777
and the rest of them go
through this little tube.

45:15.247 --> 45:17.179
But, uh, okay

45:17.181 --> 45:18.651
But what does it do?

45:19.817 --> 45:21.585
Well, it does that, but,

45:21.587 --> 45:25.625
the oranges go through
the tube and it pops out.

45:26.658 --> 45:28.123
But that's all?

45:28.125 --> 45:29.495
Well, yeah, that's,

45:30.495 --> 45:31.830
that's what it does.

45:33.265 --> 45:35.632
You said you had an invention.

45:35.634 --> 45:37.067
Well, well yeah.

45:37.069 --> 45:39.169
I mean, it's an invention,
but it's, you know,

45:39.171 --> 45:40.339
it's like a sculpture.

45:44.209 --> 45:46.212
Hm, no it's, good job.

45:50.147 --> 45:51.714
You hate it.

45:51.716 --> 45:54.019
No, it's, it's very creative.

45:58.656 --> 45:59.624
It's very creative?

46:34.759 --> 46:35.560
Hey!

46:38.129 --> 46:38.930
Shut up!

49:35.239 --> 49:36.839
Guy!

49:47.486 --> 49:48.518
No.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.386
Stay back, no.

49:56.294 --> 49:57.129
Stop it.

50:04.102 --> 50:04.937
Stop!

50:11.877 --> 50:13.109
Stupid.

50:13.111 --> 50:13.978
Stop it.

50:56.353 --> 50:57.187
Hey.

50:57.189 --> 50:58.087
Hey!

50:58.089 --> 50:58.955
What?

50:58.957 --> 51:00.056
I just killed one.

51:00.058 --> 51:01.824
I just killed one outside.

51:01.826 --> 51:04.294
I used him to plug
the hole in the fence.

51:04.296 --> 51:05.562
What were you doing outside?

51:05.564 --> 51:07.366
Guy, did you signal them?

51:08.899 --> 51:12.000
When they fly over outside,
do you signal them?

51:12.002 --> 51:13.236
Yes, of course I do.

51:13.238 --> 51:15.170
Were you
ever gonna tell me?

51:15.172 --> 51:16.605
It's too late.

51:16.607 --> 51:17.641
You don't know that.

51:17.643 --> 51:20.909
Baby, there are 50
blocks of walking corpses

51:20.911 --> 51:22.045
between us and them.

51:22.047 --> 51:23.580
This is real.

51:23.582 --> 51:25.982
We don't even know if
that place is still safe.

51:25.984 --> 51:26.919
This is safe.

51:29.053 --> 51:31.156
Jesus fucking Christ, Guy.

51:33.024 --> 51:37.029
This is like winning the fucking
lottery for you, isn't it?

51:46.203 --> 51:48.573
You promised me you
wouldn't go outside alone.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.509
And you said you'd wear pants!

51:59.049 --> 51:59.614
Make up your mind.

52:11.428 --> 52:13.898
This is a fucking signal.

52:16.468 --> 52:17.500
When it's dark.

52:17.502 --> 52:19.034
Shut up!

52:19.036 --> 52:20.069
I don't want you out here.

52:20.071 --> 52:21.507
Well, I have this.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.913
They can't, they're
not gonna see you.

52:29.915 --> 52:31.446
You're gonna, you're gonna
wear out the batteries.

52:31.448 --> 52:34.049
Right, I hear we have like
20 pounds of nine volts.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.317
It doesn't take nine volts.

52:35.319 --> 52:36.252
I know that!

52:36.254 --> 52:37.456
And they're expired.

52:38.522 --> 52:39.688
I'm going out back.

52:39.690 --> 52:40.993
Don't follow me.

53:46.658 --> 53:47.493
Sorry.

54:10.781 --> 54:11.748
It's good.

54:11.750 --> 54:12.584
I know.

54:13.651 --> 54:14.484
You're not a Manet.

54:14.486 --> 54:15.353
I know.

54:16.453 --> 54:18.022
I'm still mad at you.

54:18.756 --> 54:19.590
I know.

54:21.225 --> 54:23.094
I didn't hear a single
chopper last night.

54:24.796 --> 54:25.631
I'm sorry.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.299
I think I want to
create an entire series

54:31.301 --> 54:33.136
based on this first piece,

54:33.138 --> 54:34.440
like your second year project,

54:35.406 --> 54:37.205
and I want to name it after you.

54:37.207 --> 54:37.806
Would you like that?

54:37.808 --> 54:39.077
Sure.

54:49.654 --> 54:51.290
Hey, are we okay?

54:53.323 --> 54:54.492
We're great.

55:47.245 --> 55:48.279
Guy!

55:54.752 --> 55:55.821
There's no more water?

55:58.355 --> 56:00.522
There's no more gas
either, but it's fine.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.359
We've got the water in the
tank, and we've got electricity.

56:11.870 --> 56:13.272
Ugh.

56:46.870 --> 56:48.339
Hey, what're you doing?

56:49.540 --> 56:52.308
Oh, just looking at pictures.

56:52.310 --> 56:53.245
Come see, I fixed it.

57:03.187 --> 57:03.821
Okay.

57:05.290 --> 57:05.891
See?

57:15.533 --> 57:16.832
Right?

57:16.834 --> 57:18.301
It was for my hard drive.

57:18.303 --> 57:19.467
We have, like, at
least 10 hours,

57:19.469 --> 57:21.640
so we just turn it
on when we need it.

57:24.709 --> 57:25.544
Okay.

57:27.377 --> 57:28.212
10 hours.

57:37.689 --> 57:39.522
Local
authorities have attempted

57:39.524 --> 57:40.989
to assert control
of the situation

57:40.991 --> 57:43.225
with sweep and clear
teams working their way

57:43.227 --> 57:43.993
through the neighborhood.

57:43.995 --> 57:47.230
Wait, what was that?

57:47.232 --> 57:48.464
It just keeps repeating
over and over again.

57:48.466 --> 57:49.397
We get it.

57:49.399 --> 57:50.565
Well you don't know that,

57:50.567 --> 57:51.701
maybe that was gonna
be something different.

57:51.703 --> 57:53.002
Turn it back on.

57:53.004 --> 57:54.002
I don't want to.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.437
Guy.

57:55.439 --> 57:56.239
What?

58:10.855 --> 58:11.690
It's gone.

58:13.857 --> 58:17.259
Look, I know it's gonna be
harder for us to stay, but...

58:17.261 --> 58:18.296
Nothing's changed.

58:20.397 --> 58:21.432
They'll find us.

58:26.703 --> 58:30.005
I don't want to fight anymore.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.808
Me neither.

01:00:19.517 --> 01:00:20.982
Once
again, in order to aid

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:24.520
sweep and clear teams in
your area, place red, yellow

01:00:24.522 --> 01:00:26.654
or white fabric
outside the front door,

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.625
low to the ground and
visible from above.

01:01:29.654 --> 01:01:31.853
And we're
here with the Ruiz family,

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.121
who were barricaded
on the top floor

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:35.223
of the building before a
sweep and clear rescue.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:36.658
How are you?

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.629
We are so
lucky and so blessed.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.665
It's
every man, woman and child

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.165
for themselves out there,

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.935
and his world needs
that now more than ever.

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.636
He commands it.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:51.473
He condones it, because if
the world shall ever come back

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:53.775
to us, if the world shall
ever be whole again,

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:57.980
if the world shall be repopulated
and civilization reborn,

01:01:57.982 --> 01:02:00.114
then love must be the answer.

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.553
Love must find a way.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:40.288
Do
not enter Metro stations,

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.857
sewers or utility
tunnels for safety.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:44.627
Most have been overrun
with the infection.

01:02:44.629 --> 01:02:48.797
If you are living in less infected
areas and feel it is safe

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:52.067
to run, please, make your
way to bunkers marked

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:53.768
with the bright green dot.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.607
They contain food,
water and weapons.

01:03:00.745 --> 01:03:02.614
The search for patient
zero as the CDC

01:03:04.015 --> 01:03:06.582
is growing desperate in its
attempt to contain the outrage.

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:10.185
Locally, the LA county sheriff's
department has become...

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.738
Guy.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.808
Oh, God, what is that?

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:16.745
It looks like the sewage
came up to say good morning.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.047
Hey, how long you been up?

01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:19.114
Did you eat?

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:19.948
Ick!

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.384
Guy, gross.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:24.353
It's an honest
question, did you eat?

01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:26.288
There's poop everywhere!

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:28.257
Inside your house

01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:29.924
until it is cleared.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.931
The authorities, directions
from the authorities

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:37.268
Stay inside your house!

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:39.935
Jesus.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.469
Wait!

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:44.843
Wait?

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:52.850
Paige.

01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:54.949
Paige!

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.819
What's going on?

01:05:56.821 --> 01:05:57.422
Where are they?

01:05:59.924 --> 01:06:01.123
Did you get messages?

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:02.024
Yes, I got a whole
bunch of text messages.

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:02.891
Where did you put them?

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:03.826
What did they say?

01:06:03.828 --> 01:06:05.359
To send in our address.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.862
Did you?

01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:11.065
Yes, of course I did,
and then my phone died.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:11.933
What are you doing?

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:13.138
Where did you put...

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:16.007
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:21.810
What did you do?

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:22.877
We had an agreement.

01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:24.913
I gave them our address, Guy.

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:26.114
This is over.

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.783
Not until we have to go.

01:06:27.785 --> 01:06:29.817
This isn't paradise!

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:30.919
Okay, well, you know what?

01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:31.756
Then leave.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.323
Where will we go?

01:06:34.325 --> 01:06:36.290
We don't even know
what's out there.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.495
Look, we can wait a few hours.

01:06:39.497 --> 01:06:40.495
No!

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:43.297
Not another minute!

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:47.034
You can't make me stay here.

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.971
Jesus Christ, wait
a minute, stop it!

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:52.443
Paige, wait a minute, stop it!

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:55.511
No.

01:06:55.513 --> 01:06:56.715
Right now!

01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:00.417
Shhh, stop making
so much noise!

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.085
Stop it.

01:07:03.087 --> 01:07:03.922
Okay?

01:07:05.823 --> 01:07:07.759
Chill the fuck out.

01:07:10.895 --> 01:07:11.496
God.

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:15.200
Be right back.

01:08:25.236 --> 01:08:26.970
Fuck it.

01:09:26.397 --> 01:09:27.232
Paige!

01:09:29.934 --> 01:09:30.568
Paige!

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.037
Paige!

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:42.009
There's so many of them,
and they're coming this way.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.044
Let's go.

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:43.647
Come on.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:01.329
Where's the sword?

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.130
Quiet, okay?

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.969
It's right here, look.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.053
Oh no.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.274
Close it, close it, close it!

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:20.979
Go, go go!

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.777
What do we do?

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.247
The front door!

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:02.150
Kill him!

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.752
We're gonna shove him outside.

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:06.120
He's not a spider,
Guy, kill him inside!

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:08.123
I'm gonna use
the sword outside!

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:09.292
Guy!

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.239
Hit the power!

01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:24.873
Flip the power!

01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:26.874
Flip the switch!

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.176
No, on the thing.

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:29.647
It's on the thing.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.049
The thing!

01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:00.241
Okay, now we're leaving.

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:01.343
What?

01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:04.311
I just want to point out
that I didn't wuss out.

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:07.848
Oh God, guy, ow!

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.750
Aw, shit.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:10.852
Oh no.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.320
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:17.526
Oh shit, oh shit, ow. Guy,
this is really tingling.

01:13:17.528 --> 01:13:18.796
It feels really weird.

01:13:20.531 --> 01:13:22.463
I don't know,
okay, I don't know.

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.199
Just pour something on it.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.066
Ow!

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.468
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:28.936
Honey,
did he get you, too?

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:30.371
No, no, he didn't get you.

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:31.173
That's not a bite.

01:13:31.175 --> 01:13:32.274
Are you sure?

01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:33.341
Yes, I'm sure.

01:13:33.343 --> 01:13:33.941
Okay.

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:34.776
Okay?

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:35.643
Okay.

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.477
It's not.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:37.311
Okay.

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:38.849
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:42.553
Goddamn it!

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.254
Guy.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:47.858
Guy, stop.

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:50.325
Stop!

01:13:50.327 --> 01:13:52.960
I'm sorry, I'm so
fucking pissed off!

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.663
So am I.

01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:56.463
You don't think I'm pissed off?

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.699
Of course I do.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:58.533
Good.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:13:59.301
Great!

01:13:59.303 --> 01:14:01.268
- Great!
- Good!

01:14:13.317 --> 01:14:14.352
Ow!

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.788
Paige.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.554
All right baby, come on.

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.388
Try not to move.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.490
Come here

01:14:25.362 --> 01:14:26.163
Oh, Guy.

01:14:28.232 --> 01:14:29.267
It's burning really bad.

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:34.671
Why is it burning
in my belly so bad?

01:14:41.278 --> 01:14:42.276
Guy?

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:43.380
Yeah, baby.

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:46.651
I'm sorry I went back
to graduate school.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.618
That was stupid.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.322
No, no, shut up.

01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:54.624
It wasn't fair.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.360
You should've told me
we were in trouble.

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:00.262
I could've helped.

01:15:00.264 --> 01:15:01.933
It doesn't matter.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.808
I'm sorry for everything
stupid I ever did.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.277
You are not stupid.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.480
We were all good.

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:20.350
We're all good, baby

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.688
I don't feel anything.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.057
They're coming.

01:15:29.059 --> 01:15:30.828
They're gonna come for us, okay?

01:15:32.062 --> 01:15:34.431
Then they'll gonna be
able to fix you, okay?

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:40.834
Guy?

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:41.705
Yeah.

01:15:44.774 --> 01:15:46.410
I'm scared now.

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:55.417
We'll start a
little art colony.

01:15:55.419 --> 01:15:57.955
Our own little art colony
and you can teach art classes

01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:00.424
with all the other survivors.

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:04.828
I'll gather the supplies.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.000
'Cause whatever's out there,

01:16:10.334 --> 01:16:12.303
people are always
gonna need art, right?

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.339
They'll crave it.

01:16:16.439 --> 01:16:18.940
Hey, come on baby,
stay awake, okay?

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.374
Okay.

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:21.344
They're gonna be
here any minute.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.649
Guy, I'm so hot.

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.918
I feel so hot.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:31.455
Baby, you're cold.

01:16:32.656 --> 01:16:36.760
It's probably because you
lit all those fucking candles.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:43.565
I'm gonna put you
on the bed, okay?

01:16:43.567 --> 01:16:45.435
No, no, not our bed.

01:16:47.104 --> 01:16:50.808
You should stay away
from me now, I think.

01:16:53.143 --> 01:16:54.476
No.

01:16:54.478 --> 01:16:55.645
I don't want to hurt you.

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.450
Let's go, let's go.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.048
No.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.419
Come on.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:15.996
You wanna know what's funny?

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.535
I wish I could paint.

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:24.138
Baby?

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.974
Hey.

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:30.078
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.182
Hey.

01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:35.816
Baby?

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:36.653
Come on.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:38.589
You with me?

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:41.588
No.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.191
Oh, no, no, no. No.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.174
Ah.
