02:27.680 --> 02:30.680
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!

02:31.360 --> 02:34.280
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!

02:34.800 --> 02:36.720
Forward! Platoon, halt.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.840
At ease.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.120
What was that number in Paris?

02:53.440 --> 02:56.240
All heads up. Right face.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.080
Forward march.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.480
Extend. Hut!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.440
Swing right. Hut!

03:44.120 --> 03:47.120
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.360
Beats those replacement camps.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.800
You said the war would be over
by Christmas.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.960
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.720
The spitting image
of Camp Wolters, Texas.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.400
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.720
But all he does is fly around
in a private plane looking for ugly places.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.720
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.120
Then he checks up on the climate.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.800
If it's too hot in summer for human life
and too cold in winter...

04:19.839 --> 04:22.880
and if it has more rain, fog, wind,
and snow...

04:22.960 --> 04:27.560
than any other spot he can find,
then he plants the American flag...

04:27.920 --> 04:30.280
and proclaims it a US Army camp.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.120
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.560
Bombshell.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.400
Box steps.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.320
To the rear, freeze! Forward!

04:49.560 --> 04:51.600
To the right flank, freeze!

04:51.920 --> 04:53.760
Forward! Platoon, halt!

04:54.400 --> 04:55.640
At ease!

04:59.120 --> 05:01.360
Forty-two sixty what?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.760
- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!

05:04.840 --> 05:07.560
Platoon, attention. Right face.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.960
Forward march!

05:15.360 --> 05:17.080
The Screaming Eagle.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.120
They know who you are
when you wear that on your sleeve.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.680
It wasn't bad enough
being in Infantry Replacement.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.960
We have to volunteer
for the 101st Airborne.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.040
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.640
There must be a difference
or they wouldn't give you extra pay.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.240
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.760
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted
and sewing on shoulder patches.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.160
Why did they have to put us
in different companies?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.840
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.320
His job is to find out who your buddy is
and then to split you up.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.440
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.440
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.960
So long, Hooper.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.200
Thanks.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.080
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy...

06:41.160 --> 06:44.920
who said he'd court-martial the first man
who tossed his gas mask away?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.360
We ripped out the masks...

06:46.400 --> 06:49.320
and used the carriers
for toting that cognac we liberated.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.160
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."

06:53.240 --> 06:56.000
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad...

06:56.040 --> 06:59.360
but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.040
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.280
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.440
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...

07:08.480 --> 07:11.080
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.720
All except the replacements.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.280
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?

07:14.360 --> 07:16.680
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.960
Make yourself at home,
but on some other sack.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.040
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.800
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.840
Daisy Mae won't know you
when you get back to Dogpatch.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.800
That's for dang sure.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.000
Abner, will you please stop saying that?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.200
Fellows, look what I found.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.480
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.240
At ease, men.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.800
I heard the war was on its last legs,
so I thought I'd come back.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.680
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg...

08:00.760 --> 08:04.280
and a month later he comes back in time
for a three-day pass to Paris.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.320
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.320
Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.880
And me brooding all the time
about my dear buddies back there...

08:13.960 --> 08:15.840
defending the Republic.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.200
Will you look at that girl bait.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.240
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad
just as soon as we hit Paris.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.680
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?

08:28.480 --> 08:30.560
No, I was just sitting here.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.960
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.679
What's it like, Holley?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.159
- Paris?
- Yeah.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.919
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.280
But I happened to hear about a place
that might interest you. Place Pigalle.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.920
Pig Alley.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.280
Be sure to bring your dog tags,
because one night in Pig Alley...

08:57.320 --> 08:58.560
Excuse me.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.960
Because you're going to think
you're the Caliph of Baghdad.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.200
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.640
Compared to Pig Alley,
it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.240
How about you and me
boarding up in Paris?

09:14.320 --> 09:16.360
What's the matter,
did Pop Stazak disown you?

09:16.440 --> 09:19.880
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.520
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.280
But I'm getting me a private room
and private bath in Paris...

09:27.360 --> 09:30.080
if I have to get it at the point of a gun.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.240
The big brain wants to get away
from us common people.

09:33.320 --> 09:37.160
He hasn't got anybody around here
to chat with about the Einstein Theory.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.400
What do you mean? He's got me.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.640
There ain't nothing
we like to talk about better.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.680
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.320
He got hit in Holland.

09:57.760 --> 10:02.200
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.840
- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?

10:15.920 --> 10:18.520
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.480
They're just making me a civilian,
that's all.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.560
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.960
It ain't the arthritis.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.040
They got a report from the Red Cross...

10:29.120 --> 10:32.200
that my wife is too sick
to take care of the kids.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.640
So I let them talk me into accepting
a dependency discharge.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.400
Glad you made it, Pop.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.400
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.640
One of these days
you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie...

10:45.720 --> 10:47.640
right square in those GI teeth.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.320
Such language. You should have
learned him better manners, Pop.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.760
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.760
Any day now. I have to sweat out
a letter of confirmation...

10:56.800 --> 10:59.320
from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.920
No, I decided to catch that football game.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
That's swell. It'll be rugged
waiting around here all alone.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.320
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?

11:08.360 --> 11:11.120
That's for dang sure.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.840
I'm glad to see you guys
finally got the junk off my cot.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.560
How about dousing that light?

11:21.960 --> 11:23.840
Paris trucks are leaving early.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.600
Okay, douse it.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.440
All right, roll out of them sacks.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.280
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.160
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.480
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.600
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?

12:08.680 --> 12:10.880
Beats me. The Krauts
made a breakthrough someplace.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.760
They tell me it's gonna be cold...

12:12.800 --> 12:16.480
so wear your long johns and two pairs
of pants. Three, if you can get them on.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.080
But they told us yesterday
we'd be off the line for good.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.080
They didn't get the order
till after midnight.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.960
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.320
This is strictly for the birds, brother.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.040
Beats anything
ever I stuck my finger in before.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.520
"General, I need a crack division
to plug up that gap."

12:35.680 --> 12:39.360
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."

12:39.400 --> 12:41.880
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."

12:41.960 --> 12:44.360
"Not at all, General."

12:48.960 --> 12:51.720
Maybe the adjutant
can put in a phone call.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.560
Yeah. It's only a technicality.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.280
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!

12:58.960 --> 13:02.200
It's a secret move,
so rip off your shoulder patches.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.760
Sarge, you got any of them
rubber overshoes, them galoshes?

13:25.280 --> 13:27.800
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.

13:32.280 --> 13:36.400
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.200
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.720
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.800
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.680
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.760
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.120
I understand your problems, men.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.920
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.040
And 17 weeks at OCS,
and he's an officer and gentleman...

14:03.120 --> 14:05.720
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!

14:06.040 --> 14:07.440
Shut up!

15:04.520 --> 15:07.560
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?

15:07.680 --> 15:10.200
Do you speak French, sir?

15:10.920 --> 15:12.920
Yes. Immediately.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.160
- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.600
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.040
What time is it, Hansan?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.560
- 11:30.
- What?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.640
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.440
11:30 a.m. Central Standard Time.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.640
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.920
What's the use of changing your watch?

15:48.960 --> 15:52.440
What's the use? You're here,
you're not in Springfield, Illinois.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.880
I hear you.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.760
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.840
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.440
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.640
He found a home in the Army.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.800
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.320
Chocolate, please.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.920
Isn't she cute?

16:28.160 --> 16:30.200
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.320
Here.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.720
Get a load of mama!

16:44.560 --> 16:47.480
I'd like to keep her in chocolate
for about a week.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.440
What's she saying, Jarvess?

16:55.680 --> 16:59.600
She wants to know
if we'd like to come inside and warm up.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.880
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!

17:38.440 --> 17:42.200
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.440
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?

17:44.520 --> 17:47.640
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.720
They only occupied France for four years.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.160
Naturally they left a few spies
when they pulled out.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.120
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.720
so we'll know what's going on
once in a while?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.560
Get them inside! Come on!

18:03.800 --> 18:05.400
On the double!

18:14.800 --> 18:17.960
Kinnie, how about getting
these men in out of the hot sun?

18:18.040 --> 18:21.080
Wolowicz, Garby,
in there with the second platoon.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.600
This corner house.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.560
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.920
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.440
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.480
For once, we get a break.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.880
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting
this place in a hurry.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.000
I wouldn't mind holing up here
till Christmas.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.920
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.440
This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.880
Let's see if we can get some news.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.240
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.880
Ask her. I'll guarantee you
she can sprechen sie Deutsch.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.520
Let's live a little, Jarvess.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.840
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.760
These two little children,
they live with me, but...

19:53.600 --> 19:55.800
Slowly, please.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.920
She said she's not the mother
of the two little girls.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.120
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.240
They all got a sob story.

20:32.320 --> 20:36.280
- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.640
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.880
What you say, please?

20:41.960 --> 20:44.160
I said do you think
the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.520
What he say?

20:45.920 --> 20:48.600
Is there any coffee left?

20:48.800 --> 20:52.280
- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.320
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.760
They're all alike here.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.360
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.200
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.320
Yeah, it's about that time.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.400
We sure come a far piece today.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.160
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.960
Poor tired soldiers.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.760
- You want?
- Thank you.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.400
I go now?

21:35.200 --> 21:37.600
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.800
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe...

21:45.880 --> 21:48.600
you're either out on your feet
or you get the order to move.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.320
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.600
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.720
Good night.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.400
- Where are you going?
- Guard.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.000
What did she say?

22:25.200 --> 22:28.960
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate
from the kids till Christmas.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.080
I wish I knew for sure
we'd be here tomorrow.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.280
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?

22:35.360 --> 22:37.560
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts...

22:37.640 --> 22:40.960
so the air corps can come out
and win the war for us.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.960
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.760
This may go down in history
as the greatest gamble of the war.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.160
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.840
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.240
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.680
Wake me up early, will you?

23:12.840 --> 23:14.160
Maybe.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.600
I ought to report this
to the Inspector General.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.160
There's supposed to be 18 inches
between bunks.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.560
This is dangerous, spreads germs.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.920
There's some hot coffee on the stove.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.520
I can use it.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.720
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.600
Halt. Password.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.680
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.800
I thought the 101st
was the only division here.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.120
They will be
as soon as the rest of us can get out.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.240
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.640
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.

25:06.720 --> 25:10.400
Tanks, planes. Everything
you ever heard of and then some.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.840
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker
in English.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.120
It said Hitler will give Paris
to the Germans for a Christmas present.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.000
But they told us
it was just a weak little counterattack.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.760
They'll probably tell you
that this is a strategic withdrawal.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.600
- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.640
I'll be back in a minute.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.040
Keep an eye on... What's going on?

25:54.080 --> 25:57.560
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.760
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.280
Maybe she'll give you a refund
on those chocolate bars.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.880
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?

26:06.920 --> 26:10.080
Anything you gotta do,
you better do in 30 seconds.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.960
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.840
Drop your packs and rolls.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.440
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.400
Third platoon,
any time there's a dirty detail.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.440
Let's not be having
any talk like that, soldier.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.040
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.960
Watch out for snipers.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.960
Snipers, the man says.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.800
Second squad, over here. Dig in.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.960
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.440
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?

29:56.920 --> 30:00.960
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.680
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.720
Come on, Hansan, let's go.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.000
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.600
Get out of here.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.000
I'm sorry.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.640
Let's not try to reach China this time.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.240
There's no sense digging
if you don't go deep.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.880
Last time we dug one together...

31:54.960 --> 31:58.320
you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.040
- How does it look?
- Great.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.520
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.280
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.160
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.920
Oh, no!

32:41.520 --> 32:43.960
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole...

32:44.040 --> 32:46.480
and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.920
Will you stop yapping?

32:56.480 --> 32:59.600
First and third squads
gotta run patrols all night.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.880
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.280
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.720
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog...

33:10.560 --> 33:12.240
really gets to you.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.840
I feel kind of woozy myself.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.120
Let's go, Hansan.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.680
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.040
When you were in that camp
in New York...

33:50.080 --> 33:52.360
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.840
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?

33:54.920 --> 33:57.560
That's right. She came there to see you.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.600
Did you phone your kids long distance?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah, just before we shipped out.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.200
- Why?
- What did that cost?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.280
$2 for three minutes.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.679
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking...

34:11.480 --> 34:15.880
it's probably about as far from New York
to Wichita, where your kids were...

34:16.560 --> 34:20.280
as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles,
where my folks are.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.639
And when you get back home...

34:23.840 --> 34:26.360
what would that be, about 200 francs?

34:27.560 --> 34:29.679
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.480
Tell them that I...

34:33.440 --> 34:35.400
Well, you'll think of something.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.520
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.360
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.000
Put on that steel pot
and get over to the roadblock.

35:11.040 --> 35:14.240
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.040
They said to look out
for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.480
What about the password?

35:18.560 --> 35:21.440
That might be nice to know,
in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.920
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.080
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.600
Okay, you get half of them.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.560
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.480
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.800
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics
wouldn't let me off the line.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.600
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.200
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.800
Yeah, it sounds good.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.280
Halt! Password!

36:49.040 --> 36:50.840
- Bug.
- Jitter.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.600
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.720
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchateau.

37:01.960 --> 37:05.280
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.080
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.760
Good. Let's go.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.000
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.640
Must be a new replacement.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.200
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.480
Yes, sir.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.160
Oh, no!

38:20.160 --> 38:22.200
Look, Pop, it's snowing!

38:26.160 --> 38:28.960
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.440
You didn't, by any chance hear...

38:30.520 --> 38:33.440
that it's kind of cold
and a little on the wet side, did you?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.640
Man, it's really coming down.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.600
Well, close the window, Johnny,
and fix that hole in the roof.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.440
You should know better
than to take off your boots in a foxhole.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.880
You might want to start running fast.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.320
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.360
I ain't got no galoshes.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.320
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?

39:31.400 --> 39:35.360
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.080
- K Company?
- Yeah.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.480
I got a buddy in K Company.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.320
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.920
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.120
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.600
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.560
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.080
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?

40:08.480 --> 40:10.080
Nobody by that name in K Company.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.840
Yes, there is. He came in with
the new replacements just the other day.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.400
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.720
What's up?

40:18.800 --> 40:22.520
That kid they got at last night,
name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.120
Now I can finish
making out my morning report. Thanks.

40:30.480 --> 40:34.120
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.880
You don't know what hit you.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.800
You didn't even know his name.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.480
We didn't even find his dog tags.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.200
Chatsburg News.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.320
Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.800
I'll take it.

41:16.960 --> 41:20.240
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.960
You act as if I want a discharge.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.360
Man, I like it here.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.640
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going
to choose up sides for a snowball fight.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.640
Hand these letters out
with the rations, Hansan.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.320
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.760
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed
lemonade powder:

41:43.040 --> 41:46.760
"Simply add water
and serve ice-cold. Delicious."

41:47.120 --> 41:50.960
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.600
I want to be sure you'll be around to take
over the platoon if I have to go back.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.320
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.240
I want three volunteers
to go out on a patrol.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.480
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.400
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?

42:07.200 --> 42:10.360
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.760
G-2 says the Krauts
dropped some paratroops last night.

42:14.840 --> 42:18.520
And they might be hiding in that patch
of woods on the other side of that farm.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.840
G-2. Wonderful how
they always know what's cooking.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.320
Well, I can tell you something
they do know.

42:24.600 --> 42:29.200
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms
infiltrated right through this area.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.400
They blew up a bridge
on the road to Neufchateau.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.720
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.720
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.360
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.

42:40.440 --> 42:44.600
Spoke English perfect. Knew our
password, plan of deployment, everything.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.000
Kinnie, how about showing me
the way to the aid station?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.440
I'm freezing.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.000
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.240
Never felt so sick in my life.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.920
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.640
He's really bad.

43:06.720 --> 43:10.040
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back
to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.360
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.

43:13.440 --> 43:17.280
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.360
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

43:21.920 --> 43:24.920
Guys get sick, guys get wounded,
and nothing ever happens to me.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.640
Nothing except that time
you broke your faux choppers.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.520
It was when you were back. Kipp found
out you can't keep a man on the line...

43:31.600 --> 43:33.520
unless he's got
at least six teeth of his own.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.040
I didn't know about that.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.400
So he broke his GI teeth
with the butt of his rifle.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.080
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.840
He was off the line for two weeks
getting a new set made.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.240
Let's get this patrol on the road.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.440
That's incoming mail.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.880
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.880
We've had good deals before,
but this is the best one yet.

44:09.080 --> 44:11.800
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.

44:12.280 --> 44:14.280
I found a home in the Army.

44:27.760 --> 44:31.920
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.720
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.

44:49.760 --> 44:53.320
I hope he makes it. They should
never have sent him back on the line.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.520
Some guys just can't take it.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.200
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.240
My name is Layton.

45:03.920 --> 45:07.040
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.920
Thanks.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.840
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.160
A whole division
could be hiding in that forest.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.080
Nice job for a three-man patrol.

46:11.160 --> 46:15.440
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how
they'll know we ran into some Krauts.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.680
- What's the password?
- Texas.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.640
Keep them covered. They may be German.

46:34.720 --> 46:38.520
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.120
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.600
Will this road take us
to Third Bat headquarters?

46:43.680 --> 46:45.320
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.

46:45.400 --> 46:49.160
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?

46:50.000 --> 46:53.520
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.120
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...

46:56.160 --> 46:58.200
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?

46:58.280 --> 47:01.600
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.

47:01.680 --> 47:02.960
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?

47:03.040 --> 47:05.600
We're not taking any chances.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.400
What is this?

47:07.480 --> 47:11.680
What kind of nonsense...

47:12.560 --> 47:14.160
Drop those rifles.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.040
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.880
- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.560
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.440
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.

47:24.480 --> 47:27.240
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

47:27.320 --> 47:31.600
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.720
May I suggest, sir,
that you study up on baseball?

47:34.800 --> 47:36.480
I guess I'd better.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.200
By the way, you might tell your buddy
that Cesar Romero is out.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.360
She's married to Harry James.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.600
Let's go.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.040
They really should have sent out
a bigger patrol.

48:26.560 --> 48:29.720
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?

48:29.800 --> 48:30.960
Nobody.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.320
I'm just saying
the best way is to tell them...

48:33.400 --> 48:35.760
you heard voices talking in German.

48:36.040 --> 48:40.120
Let's say we heard voices talking
in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.640
That paper any good?

48:49.920 --> 48:53.080
Best in the world. Sedalia News.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.880
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and
you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.440
Get a load of this.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.560
"Our Changing Times,
by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...

49:05.640 --> 49:08.920
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist
and her favorite husband...

49:09.000 --> 49:11.160
"now on active duty, US Army."

49:12.160 --> 49:13.920
You knew I worked on a newspaper.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.080
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.760
I was too good. I wrote a piece
about the real meaning of the war...

49:19.840 --> 49:23.480
the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.

49:23.520 --> 49:26.480
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.160
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train...

49:30.680 --> 49:32.600
waving bye-bye to my wife.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.960
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.560
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...

49:42.720 --> 49:44.200
I'd get those wire releases...

49:44.280 --> 49:48.440
and know that I was the first person
in town who had the news. All the news.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.920
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows
what's going on in Bastogne.

49:53.760 --> 49:56.200
All I know is
what's happening to the second squad...

49:56.280 --> 49:58.400
in the third platoon of I Company.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.280
Watch this one.

50:11.840 --> 50:12.960
Strike!

50:13.880 --> 50:16.280
Can't hit them if you can't see them.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.880
Now the count's three and two.

50:23.360 --> 50:27.120
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.400
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.560
Burn it in, boy. Come on.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.960
A hit right over second base.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.880
There, the center fielder
made a shoestring catch. You're out.

50:54.240 --> 50:56.680
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?

50:56.760 --> 50:58.760
Don't you get it? Right over second base.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.760
- Texas.
- Leaguer.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.400
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.840
Hiya, fellows.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.480
What's the situation, Lieutenant?

51:10.560 --> 51:13.440
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.520
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.

51:16.600 --> 51:19.440
You can tell them to stop worrying
about this area.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.200
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.640
- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.640
- So long.
- So long, fellows.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.120
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.160
Come on!

53:30.120 --> 53:31.800
Kraut tanks!

53:39.320 --> 53:40.720
No. Take off, will you?

53:40.800 --> 53:43.960
If they think we're all getting away,
maybe I've got a chance.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.320
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.

53:54.600 --> 53:57.720
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.560
Let's go.

55:14.760 --> 55:18.160
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.

55:18.240 --> 55:21.200
Think we've got enough
antitank grenades to do any good?

55:21.280 --> 55:22.840
We ain't got any.

55:41.600 --> 55:44.200
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?

55:44.760 --> 55:45.720
What?

55:45.800 --> 55:49.600
Sir, our usual defense against tanks
is to call for artillery...

55:49.680 --> 55:51.680
and then run like a jackrabbit.

55:51.760 --> 55:54.000
We've got orders to hold these positions.

55:54.080 --> 55:58.080
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery
and keep our heads down.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.400
We could send out some bazooka men,
if we had any bazookas.

56:04.040 --> 56:06.640
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.440
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.720
Concentration 17.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.440
Item three to ltem:

56:24.560 --> 56:27.640
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.040
Concentration 17.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.960
Roger. Start the fireworks.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.960
That's great. Artillery can't miss.

56:38.040 --> 56:41.080
They've got Roderigues to use
for an aiming stick.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.920
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues
as soon as this barrage lifts.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.840
With what, a sponge?

56:48.480 --> 56:51.520
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?

56:51.600 --> 56:53.840
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.

56:53.920 --> 56:56.280
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.960
Your squad sent for the meat wagon
after the last shelling.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.

57:17.360 --> 57:18.680
Is he bad?

57:18.880 --> 57:21.240
A shell landed
right on the edge of his foxhole.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.240
His shoulder's like a sieve.

57:25.480 --> 57:28.840
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.

57:30.040 --> 57:33.120
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.280
You're in charge now.

57:37.480 --> 57:39.680
Leadership. That's what I got.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.160
Where's Roderigues?

57:52.880 --> 57:54.560
He'll be along, Pop.

57:56.880 --> 57:59.000
Should have worn my shoulder pads.

58:00.280 --> 58:04.200
In a couple of months you'll be flipping
those forward passes as good as ever.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.760
Yeah, left-handed.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.240
He's a good man, Holley...

58:17.400 --> 58:19.120
but still a little jumpy.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.560
He can move in with me.

58:22.920 --> 58:24.480
You could do worse.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.080
He sleeps warm and quiet.

58:28.640 --> 58:31.760
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.600
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.400
Say hello to Standiferd.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.280
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?

58:43.680 --> 58:45.520
Is that incoming mail?

58:46.680 --> 58:49.520
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.

58:49.560 --> 58:53.960
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.920
Where's Roderigues?

58:59.640 --> 59:01.400
Let's take a walk, Pop.

59:11.880 --> 59:15.120
How much longer
are they going to leave him out there?

59:18.880 --> 59:22.040
Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.481
I want three volunteers.

59:31.801 --> 59:33.561
It's a long walk, Pop.

59:38.641 --> 59:41.521
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.

59:42.401 --> 59:44.041
You don't have to, Layton.

59:44.761 --> 59:46.921
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.

59:51.081 --> 59:53.721
What are you looking for, Kipp,
your discharge?

59:53.801 --> 59:55.841
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?

59:55.881 --> 59:58.881
They were searching me on
a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.

59:58.961 --> 01:00:01.201
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.

01:00:01.841 --> 01:00:04.921
I hope it's nice and warm
back where you're going.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:08.561
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.

01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:52.841
No! Keep your eye open.

01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:42.601
He used to see snow
way off in the mountains.

01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:47.921
They say it's just like going to sleep.

01:01:59.401 --> 01:02:01.201
He was a religious kid.

01:02:04.001 --> 01:02:05.801
When anyone got hit...

01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:09.801
he used to say it was God's will.

01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:55.281
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.

01:02:56.361 --> 01:03:00.041
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on
yesterday under a news eclipse...

01:03:00.121 --> 01:03:04.481
"from which filtered the fact that German
armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."

01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:06.241
We're in Belgium, aren't we?

01:03:06.321 --> 01:03:08.801
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.

01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:13.441
"War Department authorities report
that morale is high all along the front.

01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:16.281
"Battle-hardened doughboys
fresh from epic-making triumphs..."

01:03:16.361 --> 01:03:17.961
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.

01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:21.121
"Air activity was halted by
thick, swirling fog.

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:28.361
"At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."

01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:29.881
Hey, that's us.

01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:35.041
Then you'll be proud to know
that you are making a heroic stand...

01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:38.681
"hurling back the best
that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:42.841
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.

01:03:42.961 --> 01:03:45.121
Is the 101st the only division up here?

01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.641
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.

01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:50.881
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.

01:03:50.921 --> 01:03:53.601
Well, this might be it. It looks official.

01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:55.801
Chatsburg News.

01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:05.641
And The Dogpatch Gazette.

01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:11.241
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie,
before those feet of yours get any worse.

01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:14.241
They won't take frozen feet
unless they start to change color.

01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:18.481
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.

01:04:18.601 --> 01:04:21.121
All they got at the aid station
is aspirin and iodine.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:23.841
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:28.441
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.

01:04:28.521 --> 01:04:31.321
It must have been after the meat wagon
got there with Wolowicz.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:35.241
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.

01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:38.441
They say the fight they put up
was one for the book.

01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:58.761
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?

01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:02.921
The dreams are getting better all the time.

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.641
I was back home in Baltimore...

01:05:06.441 --> 01:05:09.841
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.

01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:12.961
That dream's against regulation, soldier.

01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:16.161
You know what our boys overseas
always dream about.

01:05:16.481 --> 01:05:19.201
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!

01:05:19.561 --> 01:05:22.881
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home...

01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:26.601
just give me a hot dog
and a slice of that pie.

01:05:26.961 --> 01:05:29.561
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?

01:05:29.641 --> 01:05:32.641
No sirree. All I want is a...

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:38.561
So long, Holley.

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:40.841
So long, Pop.

01:05:40.921 --> 01:05:43.841
- Au revoir.
- I found them!

01:05:43.881 --> 01:05:46.761
I found them in another pocket!

01:05:47.161 --> 01:05:50.841
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.

01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:55.361
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:

01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:58.561
"Private Ernest J. Stazak
will proceed to Paris...

01:05:58.641 --> 01:06:01.721
"where transportation to the US
will be arranged."

01:06:01.801 --> 01:06:04.641
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?

01:06:05.001 --> 01:06:07.081
Here, read it yourself.

01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:09.281
I don't care what it says.

01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:12.441
Nobody's leaving Bastogne,
and nobody's coming in...

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:16.921
except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.

01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:18.961
Surrounded?

01:06:22.201 --> 01:06:24.001
If this is one of your crummy jokes...

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.801
I'll knock those GI teeth
right down your throat.

01:06:33.401 --> 01:06:35.321
Take it easy, Pop.

01:06:35.401 --> 01:06:39.281
He wouldn't have those teeth back
in his mouth if there was any way out.

01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:02.161
Tough break, Pop.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:07.681
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:12.121
It's against the rules of war
to shoot at civilians.

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:18.041
I'm sorry, Kipp.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:48.001
Them poor devils
in the footslogging infantry...

01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:51.041
nothing but walk, walk, walk.

01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:53.041
The airborne, that's the life.

01:07:53.121 --> 01:07:57.121
It's great up here in these gliders,
drifting along over the clouds.

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:25.640
They're liable to have you up
in juvenile court for smoking.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.841
This your first time
away from home, Layton?

01:08:27.881 --> 01:08:31.001
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.

01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.401
My folks stayed for a while
at a town near camp.

01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:38.441
Did Mama rub your little footsies
after those nasty 20-mile hikes?

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:42.841
She made me brush my teeth
twice a day...

01:08:43.321 --> 01:08:46.001
so I wouldn't have to
have them all pulled out.

01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:56.161
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.801
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.

01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:02.801
You'll die of old age
before you see a shadow around here.

01:09:02.881 --> 01:09:04.881
This fog ain't never gonna lift.

01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:08.361
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:10.640
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.361
I don't believe that, Kipp.

01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:15.161
Reverend Layton
will now lead us in prayer.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.321
Might not be a bad idea.

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:23.520
The C.O. Says you're to dig in
at that railroad embankment.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.841
The rest of the company's
moving back 500 yards.

01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:27.001
Right.

01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:34.041
Third platoon,
whenever there's a dirty detail.

01:09:36.121 --> 01:09:38.520
Let's go, men. On your feet.

01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:56.281
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.

01:09:56.361 --> 01:09:58.921
Listen to Holley,
making a noise like a sergeant.

01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:02.961
He's really GI now since he took over
the squad. Right on the ball.

01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:05.801
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.

01:10:06.401 --> 01:10:08.521
Let's be chicken those bolts.

01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:16.321
Check your rifles.

01:10:46.001 --> 01:10:48.361
Why can't they pass down
some information?

01:10:49.081 --> 01:10:52.121
If a man gets hit, he must at least know
what country he's dying in.

01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:54.761
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.

01:10:54.841 --> 01:10:56.441
I've asked you 800 times...

01:10:56.521 --> 01:10:59.841
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.

01:12:09.401 --> 01:12:10.881
Can't see them.

01:14:36.361 --> 01:14:38.081
I'm with you, Holley.

01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:41.081
Come on.

01:15:04.561 --> 01:15:08.001
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!

01:15:11.521 --> 01:15:12.921
Let's go, Abner!

01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:26.761
Mama.

01:15:43.521 --> 01:15:45.201
Wait till it clears.

01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:47.641
Hold your fire.

01:17:07.281 --> 01:17:10.001
Tell them to come out with their hands up.

01:17:41.041 --> 01:17:44.361
Layton, you and Joe
check them for maps and papers.

01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:47.681
See if any of them are still kicking.

01:18:06.441 --> 01:18:09.321
Get the prisoners and wounded
back to Bastogne, Sergeant.

01:18:09.361 --> 01:18:11.481
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:14.121
I'm going to put this man in
for a Silver Star.

01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:39.681
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.

01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:49.121
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.

01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:50.881
How do you know
what Holley was thinking?

01:18:50.921 --> 01:18:53.321
How do you know if he was thinking at all?

01:18:53.401 --> 01:18:54.521
Things just happen.

01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:57.721
Afterwards you try to figure out
why you acted the way you did.

01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:00.761
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.

01:19:00.921 --> 01:19:04.481
You just joined the biggest club
in the Army. Everybody belongs.

01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:08.801
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?

01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:10.481
A good thing somebody did.

01:19:10.561 --> 01:19:13.561
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.

01:19:13.801 --> 01:19:16.641
It happened so fast,
you had no time to look at your watch.

01:19:16.681 --> 01:19:19.401
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was
in Springfield.

01:19:19.481 --> 01:19:22.601
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.

01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:31.361
Let's get out of here, chum.

01:19:48.841 --> 01:19:50.241
Thanks, Pop.

01:19:51.801 --> 01:19:53.361
I'll drop back later.

01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:55.481
Just don't get carried back.

01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:06.641
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?

01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:11.521
Morphine. Him.

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.081
No more morphine?

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.641
That's great.

01:20:52.401 --> 01:20:55.481
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.

01:21:11.001 --> 01:21:12.641
They're way too big.

01:21:14.481 --> 01:21:16.561
I wished we'd found them yesterday.

01:21:19.281 --> 01:21:20.801
Let's go, men. Chow!

01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:23.561
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!

01:21:29.241 --> 01:21:32.521
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.

01:21:32.561 --> 01:21:34.761
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.

01:21:34.841 --> 01:21:37.161
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.

01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:41.041
I wanted to go back on the line.

01:21:41.121 --> 01:21:43.201
But they're short-handed
in the kitchen, see.

01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:45.561
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.

01:21:46.121 --> 01:21:48.561
I wouldn't mind a little action
for a change.

01:21:50.001 --> 01:21:51.521
How about you and me switching?

01:21:51.561 --> 01:21:55.001
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.

01:21:56.201 --> 01:21:59.361
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.

01:21:59.841 --> 01:22:01.921
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.

01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:05.241
I don't even see those things.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.561
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.

01:22:15.481 --> 01:22:18.881
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.161
Where's the kid?

01:22:21.401 --> 01:22:24.921
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess,
putting on those dry clothes.

01:22:25.001 --> 01:22:27.681
Bettis, how about breaking loose
with a bottle of cognac?

01:22:27.761 --> 01:22:28.881
We ain't got any.

01:22:28.961 --> 01:22:31.321
I'll settle for some hot water
to wash my feet in.

01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:32.921
Coming right up.

01:22:40.401 --> 01:22:42.841
Bettis, you got any trading material?

01:22:42.921 --> 01:22:46.441
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.

01:22:46.521 --> 01:22:48.201
A half a loaf is...

01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:50.041
Where is it?

01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:53.641
I could have sworn it was on that table.

01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:07.201
Hello, soldier.

01:23:16.441 --> 01:23:18.321
Pull up a chair, Holley.

01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:24.801
Today you are a man.

01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:48.881
This is Antwerp, up here.

01:23:50.241 --> 01:23:52.961
To the north and the east
are the British and the Canadians.

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:56.961
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away,
is the French First Army.

01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:00.601
The Americans are stretched out
all the way in between.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.801
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut...

01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:07.041
at least 20 Allied divisions
will be strictly out on a limb.

01:24:07.281 --> 01:24:08.961
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.

01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:13.681
This is where the Krauts
found a soft spot in our line.

01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:16.521
You see why Bastogne is so important.

01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:19.001
It's at the main intersection
of seven main highways...

01:24:19.081 --> 01:24:21.481
one of them leading straight to Antwerp.

01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:23.521
Don't know if we can hold out.

01:24:24.281 --> 01:24:26.121
That sounds like ours.

01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:30.201
It is ours!

01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:35.841
Can't see a thing.

01:24:35.881 --> 01:24:38.161
The supplies they've got to drop,
we wouldn't want.

01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:39.921
A crate of eggs for Berlin.

01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.401
If bombers can get through,
why can't C-47s?

01:24:42.481 --> 01:24:43.521
In this pea soup?

01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:46.361
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.

01:24:46.441 --> 01:24:49.321
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.

01:24:49.401 --> 01:24:52.801
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!

01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:55.801
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

01:24:56.721 --> 01:24:58.281
You can say that again.

01:25:03.441 --> 01:25:05.761
I thought they had us surrounded.

01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:07.201
Halt.

01:25:14.601 --> 01:25:17.441
I speak English. Who is here in command?

01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:20.001
I am here in command.

01:25:20.361 --> 01:25:22.841
We have a message
for the commanding general.

01:25:23.361 --> 01:25:26.281
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.

01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:47.961
Try it again, Jarvess.

01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:58.121
All I can get out of them
is their name and rank.

01:26:00.081 --> 01:26:01.961
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.

01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:04.001
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.

01:26:08.161 --> 01:26:10.401
How would you like some nice K rations?

01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:31.241
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.

01:26:40.201 --> 01:26:41.481
What did he say?

01:26:41.801 --> 01:26:43.441
They want us to surrender.

01:26:43.721 --> 01:26:45.641
"Surrender or be killed," he says.

01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:46.921
Us?

01:26:47.441 --> 01:26:50.561
Tell him to go take a flying leap
at a rolling doughnut.

01:27:19.841 --> 01:27:22.441
The Major thinks General McAuliffe
must have misunderstood.

01:27:22.521 --> 01:27:24.841
We've appealed
to the well-known American humanity...

01:27:24.881 --> 01:27:27.681
to save the people of Bastogne
from further suffering.

01:27:27.721 --> 01:27:32.081
We have given you two hours to consider
before raining destruction upon you.

01:27:32.201 --> 01:27:35.081
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.

01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:38.681
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"

01:27:49.321 --> 01:27:52.081
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?

01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:54.241
"Nuts" is strictly negative.

01:28:01.321 --> 01:28:03.401
We will kill many Americans.

01:28:07.201 --> 01:28:08.761
On your way, bud.

01:28:35.401 --> 01:28:38.401
I feel better. For once we know
what's going on around here.

01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:39.761
For once we get the story...

01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:42.961
before my wife writes it up
and it's the daily news.

01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:27.521
Here goes my last butt.

01:29:27.881 --> 01:29:30.801
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.

01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:34.601
Chaplain. I forgot.

01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:37.321
We've got nothing to worry about.

01:29:37.401 --> 01:29:40.841
Holy Joe is going to pray for us
at the Christmas services.

01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:48.161
"They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength.

01:29:48.881 --> 01:29:51.601
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles."

01:29:53.361 --> 01:29:54.921
If the fog lifts.

01:29:56.321 --> 01:29:58.681
"They shall run, and not be weary."

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.881
Unless they have frozen feet.

01:30:03.121 --> 01:30:05.601
"And they shall walk, and not faint."

01:30:06.561 --> 01:30:09.721
If they don't lose too much blood
before the medics come up.

01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:32.241
Another airmail message from the Krauts.

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:36.441
"Merry Christmas, soldier,
and our deepest sympathy.

01:30:36.881 --> 01:30:39.521
"It's tough being away from home
at this time of year...

01:30:39.561 --> 01:30:42.721
"especially when you're surrounded
and outnumbered 10-to-1.

01:30:43.641 --> 01:30:47.201
"Don't you feel your loved ones
worrying about you, praying for you?

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:50.561
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping
you'll come home again.

01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:54.641
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:58.201
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.

01:30:58.761 --> 01:31:03.041
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you
only 300 yards away."

01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:52.481
Anybody here from Ohio?

01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:54.041
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.

01:31:54.121 --> 01:31:55.921
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.

01:31:56.001 --> 01:31:58.961
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?

01:31:59.041 --> 01:32:00.641
Here, sir.

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.921
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.

01:32:04.401 --> 01:32:05.601
So am I.

01:32:06.201 --> 01:32:10.161
These services aren't just for Lutherans,
any more than just for men from Ohio.

01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:12.241
I merely happen to be in your area.

01:32:12.321 --> 01:32:16.481
In other areas, there are other chaplains
of various denominations and religions.

01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:19.401
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:23.321
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services...

01:32:23.401 --> 01:32:25.561
for some of the men of the Jewish faith.

01:32:25.641 --> 01:32:27.281
How did I do, Levenstein?

01:32:27.361 --> 01:32:29.121
Not bad for a beginner, sir.

01:32:32.241 --> 01:32:33.681
Now it's nearly Christmas...

01:32:33.761 --> 01:32:37.281
and here we are in beautiful Bastogne
enjoying the winter sports.

01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:41.441
And the $64 question is:

01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:43.841
"Was this trip necessary?"

01:32:50.641 --> 01:32:52.521
I'll try to answer that.

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:54.961
But my sermons,
like everything else in the army...

01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:57.121
depend on the situation and the terrain.

01:32:57.161 --> 01:32:59.921
So I assure you
this is going to be a quickie.

01:33:00.001 --> 01:33:02.041
Was this trip necessary?

01:33:04.201 --> 01:33:05.801
Let's look at the facts.

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.441
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.

01:33:08.841 --> 01:33:12.801
A great many people tried to deal
with them, and a lot of them are dead.

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.241
Millions have died...

01:33:14.281 --> 01:33:17.641
for no other reason
except that the Nazis wanted them dead.

01:33:17.721 --> 01:33:21.721
So, in the final showdown,
there was nothing left to do except fight.

01:33:23.001 --> 01:33:24.921
There's a great lesson in this.

01:33:25.321 --> 01:33:28.481
Those of us who've learned it
the hard way aren't going to forget it.

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:33.081
We must never again
let any force dedicated to a super-race...

01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:36.001
or a super-idea, or super-anything...

01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:39.401
become strong enough
to impose itself upon a free world.

01:33:40.201 --> 01:33:43.201
We must be smart enough
and tough enough in the beginning...

01:33:43.241 --> 01:33:45.921
to put out the fire
before it starts spreading.

01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:49.481
So my answer to the $64 question is:

01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:53.081
Yes, this trip was necessary.

01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:58.081
As the years go by,
a lot of people are going to forget.

01:33:58.281 --> 01:33:59.681
But you won't.

01:33:59.881 --> 01:34:02.041
And don't ever let anybody tell you...

01:34:02.121 --> 01:34:05.361
you were a sucker
to fight in the war against Fascism.

01:34:06.361 --> 01:34:08.961
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.

01:34:11.961 --> 01:34:14.161
Let us pray for this fog to lift.

01:34:15.361 --> 01:34:16.921
Almighty God...

01:34:22.401 --> 01:34:26.401
The organist is hitting those bass notes
a little too loud for me to be heard.

01:34:26.481 --> 01:34:29.881
So let us each pray in his own way,
to his own God.

01:35:09.761 --> 01:35:12.401
When you hear planes, men,
don't bother to look up.

01:35:12.481 --> 01:35:13.761
They'll be ours.

01:35:13.961 --> 01:35:16.361
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.

01:35:19.201 --> 01:35:23.601
Layton, you haven't got
a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?

01:35:24.001 --> 01:35:26.161
I'm on that new lemonade diet.

01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:29.361
Drop another nickel in the jukebox,
will you, chum?

01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:36.321
We interrupt this program
with an important announcement.

01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:39.241
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

01:35:39.281 --> 01:35:41.281
lead to the following weather forecast.

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:45.241
Continued cold, more snow,
and no sign of the fog lifting.

01:35:45.641 --> 01:35:48.641
And now an old favorite,
which is growing more and more popular...

01:35:48.721 --> 01:35:52.081
with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.

01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:15.681
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.

01:36:15.761 --> 01:36:18.601
What am I supposed to use
for ammunition? Spitballs?

01:36:18.641 --> 01:36:20.641
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.

01:36:20.681 --> 01:36:24.081
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.

01:36:24.161 --> 01:36:25.881
Try and get some news on that radio.

01:36:25.961 --> 01:36:29.841
Krauts have got it jammed up,
everything except their own wavelength.

01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:31.361
I'll try again.

01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:36.281
They ain't even dug in.

01:36:36.361 --> 01:36:37.681
- Holley.
- What?

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:41.081
Is there anything to those stories
about Krauts shooting prisoners?

01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:44.321
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.

01:36:44.681 --> 01:36:47.961
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol
on you when you're captured...

01:36:48.041 --> 01:36:49.601
they blow your brains out with it.

01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:51.721
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.

01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:56.481
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.

01:36:57.841 --> 01:36:59.241
Thanks a lot.

01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:03.601
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act
for a civilian to carry firearms.

01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:20.801
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.

01:37:22.081 --> 01:37:24.081
Other side of the hill! Dig in!

01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:52.081
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:55.721
leads me to believe
that German bombers are over Bastogne...

01:37:55.881 --> 01:37:57.321
fog or no fog.

01:37:59.481 --> 01:38:02.001
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.

01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:03.881
Yeah, I've been thinking...

01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:06.041
the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant...

01:38:06.121 --> 01:38:09.121
the pill roller who gives us those shots
with a square needle...

01:38:09.161 --> 01:38:10.961
I'm bleeding for them.

01:38:31.881 --> 01:38:33.481
...let me avoid death...

01:38:33.561 --> 01:38:35.321
let me have forgiveness...

01:38:35.401 --> 01:38:37.041
the eternal farewell.

01:39:24.361 --> 01:39:26.401
Fall out in and draw a rifle!

01:39:26.481 --> 01:39:29.001
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.

01:39:30.641 --> 01:39:33.841
The medics told me I wasn't supposed
to go up anymore. You can check.

01:39:33.921 --> 01:39:35.481
Get your blanket.

01:39:47.561 --> 01:39:50.281
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!

01:39:52.401 --> 01:39:54.361
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.

01:39:54.441 --> 01:39:56.841
Follow me, all of you, on the double!

01:40:03.161 --> 01:40:04.601
That's all, brother.

01:40:05.801 --> 01:40:07.921
Hey, you! Front and center!

01:40:11.241 --> 01:40:15.201
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.

01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:18.721
Last time I was out on the range,
they were still using the.03.

01:40:19.601 --> 01:40:22.441
All litter cases will prepare
to be evacuated immediately...

01:40:22.521 --> 01:40:23.801
to air raid shelters.

01:40:23.881 --> 01:40:26.961
All walking wounded
will fall out and draw rifles.

01:40:57.001 --> 01:41:00.681
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated,
clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.

01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:04.121
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.

01:41:04.201 --> 01:41:08.001
To load it, you just pull the bolt back
like this, and stick the clip in.

01:41:16.121 --> 01:41:19.161
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.

01:41:20.001 --> 01:41:22.961
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.

01:41:44.841 --> 01:41:47.281
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.

01:41:52.521 --> 01:41:55.361
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.

01:41:56.041 --> 01:41:58.081
Lieutenant, take the second squad.

01:41:58.201 --> 01:42:01.441
First squad! Third squad! Over here.

01:42:24.961 --> 01:42:26.481
Save it, Layton.

01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:30.041
They'll be getting a lot closer,
and we'll still be here.

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.241
It's shining!

01:43:49.881 --> 01:43:51.321
How have you been?

01:43:57.601 --> 01:44:01.521
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!

01:44:13.321 --> 01:44:15.681
Drive them out of there! Blast them!

01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:22.241
C-47s!

01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:40.961
What was that about eagles?

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:43.401
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles.

01:44:54.241 --> 01:44:56.041
"They shall run and not be weary."

01:44:56.121 --> 01:44:58.801
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

01:45:47.561 --> 01:45:50.841
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?

01:45:51.121 --> 01:45:54.041
I got a little old lamp I got to fill
back in Bastogne.

01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:12.161
K rations.

01:46:13.201 --> 01:46:14.561
All dinners.

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:23.081
Hey, fellows, here it is.

01:46:25.121 --> 01:46:27.361
Hey, fellows, come and get it.

01:46:39.081 --> 01:46:40.601
Here, take your watch.

01:47:56.961 --> 01:47:59.281
Daddy, what are them things?

01:48:00.881 --> 01:48:04.241
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.

01:48:04.321 --> 01:48:06.481
Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.

01:48:06.561 --> 01:48:08.681
What will they think of next?

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:12.281
Tank job, cigarette for papa?

01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:17.161
Got a Stars and Stripes?

01:48:19.241 --> 01:48:22.281
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.

01:48:24.361 --> 01:48:27.241
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.

01:48:30.401 --> 01:48:31.801
Hey, handsome.

01:48:34.201 --> 01:48:35.481
Good luck!

01:48:42.201 --> 01:48:45.081
The folks back home
knew we'd get out of this.

01:48:45.441 --> 01:48:48.601
They heard relief was breaking through
two days ago.

01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:51.841
Fine. I'd hate to think
they'd been worrying.

01:48:53.601 --> 01:48:56.801
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium,
not Luxembourg.

01:48:57.761 --> 01:49:00.681
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.

01:49:00.761 --> 01:49:03.161
You mean you're not happy in the service?

01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:05.641
I didn't say that. I love it.

01:49:06.121 --> 01:49:07.841
You found a home in the Army, chum.

01:49:07.921 --> 01:49:10.561
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.

01:49:48.361 --> 01:49:51.641
Third platoon, on your feet.

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.321
Fall in.

01:49:58.121 --> 01:50:00.241
Oh, no!

01:50:34.521 --> 01:50:36.641
About face.

01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:52.001
Forward march.

01:51:12.841 --> 01:51:14.761
Whatever happened to Jody?

01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:26.561
All right. Come on.

01:51:26.641 --> 01:51:29.441
What do you want these guys to think,
you're a bunch of WACs?

01:51:29.521 --> 01:51:32.801
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.
