WEBVTT

00:22.321 --> 00:24.089
[bubbling]

00:24.190 --> 00:27.760
Please! Please don't!
Come on, I got a family!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.300
-[screams]
-[splashes]

00:29.300 --> 00:30.897
[realtor] Now, that's just
a staging kill,

00:30.897 --> 00:33.432
but if volcano sacrifices
is your thing,

00:33.533 --> 00:35.301
this is the lair for you.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.993
-I'll take it!
-Great!

00:36.993 --> 00:39.405
-I'll draw up the papers--
-Aah... You know,
on the other hand,

00:39.506 --> 00:42.241
is the giant skull a bit
too flashy for my brand?

00:42.341 --> 00:44.310
Can we see some other options?

00:44.411 --> 00:47.447
You'll love this one.
A short getaway from
all the major banks.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.383
Sounds like a dream.
Where is it?

00:49.482 --> 00:51.183
[realtor]
You're standing on it.

00:51.283 --> 00:54.621
An intricate system of tunnels
carved by The Mole.

00:54.621 --> 00:58.191
I mean, hey, I love it,
but am I really going
for a "mole lady" vibe?

00:58.290 --> 01:00.259
[sighs] Ah, okay. Next!

01:00.259 --> 01:02.462
[realtor] The last tenant,
Mr. Freeze, did a number
on the place,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.432
but the castle is perfect
for entertaining.

01:05.531 --> 01:07.167
Hmm, not sure my nips

01:07.266 --> 01:08.868
and her buds can handle
this cold.

01:08.968 --> 01:11.203
[sighs] You've seen six lairs.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.572
Okay, thank you.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.676
Let's just discuss this
out of the cold.

01:15.775 --> 01:19.412
A super villain's lair
is a reflection of who
they really are.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.715
So, who
<i>is</i> Harley Quinn?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.283
That's a hard question to ans--

01:23.283 --> 01:25.251
Harls, you got us uniforms!

01:25.352 --> 01:28.355
[excitedly] Ooh, Suicide Squad!
Is that our name?

01:28.454 --> 01:30.823
Ugh, it's a group that keeps
trying to get me to join.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.725
I don't want to run lines
with you.

01:32.825 --> 01:35.227
Good!
Because I despise that phrase.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.831
People run marathons,
not lines.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.266
Actors exchange true--

01:40.367 --> 01:41.534
Look what Harley got us.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.236
-[Dr. Psycho] Ah! Ah! Come on!
-[sighs]

01:43.335 --> 01:46.239
Ivy, you're evicted!
You and the circus act here

01:46.338 --> 01:49.376
need to move out
faster than sauerkraut
through my lower intestine.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.311
[irritated] Yes, Sy!
We're leaving in a minute.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.614
Good. I'm showing
the place to--

01:53.713 --> 01:56.617
[yelling] That just cost you
your security deposit!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.618
You know what,
why don't I come back
another time?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.519
No, sorry, sorry,
don't go. Don't go.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.290
Look, [sighs]
it's just Joker made
the big decisions.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.625
Okay. How about we ask you

02:04.625 --> 02:06.358
some questions
and maybe that'll help?

02:06.459 --> 02:09.295
Worth a shot. Why did you
first become a villain?

02:09.395 --> 02:10.764
Well, you know, it's because--

02:10.764 --> 02:12.298
There you go.
You know this answer.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.266
-Uh, well...
-You know this.

02:14.366 --> 02:15.836
[sighs] I guess...

02:15.836 --> 02:17.270
-I don't know.
-Oh, my God.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.806
What villain do you
most admire?

02:18.906 --> 02:20.372
-[irritated] I don't know!
-Harley!

02:20.373 --> 02:21.807
-Chocolate or vanilla!
-I don't know!

02:21.808 --> 02:25.444
Harley! I can't help you,
until you tell me

02:25.444 --> 02:27.614
who you are!

02:27.614 --> 02:31.251
-I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know! [screams]
-[bone crunches]

02:34.554 --> 02:36.657
Oh, shit. Harley?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.825
-Honey, can you hear me?
-[Mr. Psycho grunts]

02:38.925 --> 02:41.662
"Dry clean only."
Fuck this.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.497
Okay, who broke Harley?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.564
[theme music playing]

02:48.300 --> 02:49.870
Harley, are you in there?

02:50.670 --> 02:51.838
Dude?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.340
-[Poison Ivy] Whoa! Stop!
-[laughs]

02:53.340 --> 02:55.307
Unmouth her, fiend!

02:55.407 --> 02:56.877
I was just trying
to give her CPR.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.611
Harley, snap out of it!
Come on!

02:58.711 --> 03:00.614
Ah! No response
to physical stimuli.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.649
It's probably
a level-four brain freeze.

03:02.748 --> 03:05.251
Psycho, can you fix her?
Like, go in her brain

03:05.352 --> 03:06.687
and do the fucking thing.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.522
That sounds like something
a doctor could do.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.224
But not someone
you just referred to
as "Psycho."

03:12.224 --> 03:14.627
Ugh, fine,
<i>Dr.</i> Psycho!

03:14.728 --> 03:16.295
[exclaims] Yes!

03:16.395 --> 03:18.264
Can you fix her?

03:18.365 --> 03:21.769
Can I fix her? [laughs]
Of course I can fix her!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.569
I'm just gonna slip
inside her brain,

03:23.569 --> 03:25.104
do my thing, wham-bam,
thank you, ma'am--

03:25.105 --> 03:26.873
and I'm done
in-a two minutes.

03:26.973 --> 03:30.711
Oh, fucking gross! You think
I'm gonna let you creep around

03:30.811 --> 03:32.445
Harley's head without us,
you perv?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.981
-Yes! Perv!
-You're the perv!

03:35.000 --> 03:38.418
But, as a professional,
I will tell you to prepare

03:38.418 --> 03:41.520
because this is serious,
meticulous, neuron processing

03:41.622 --> 03:42.923
we're about to undertake.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.557
Now, everyone hold hands

03:44.557 --> 03:49.557
and squeeze
your butt cheeks together.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.030
Ahh!

04:00.907 --> 04:03.157
[all screaming]

04:09.650 --> 04:11.617
-[thudding]
-[screaming]

04:11.717 --> 04:13.787
-Whoa! Everyone okay?
-[grunts]

04:13.887 --> 04:15.756
-Where's Psycho?
-[exclaims]

04:15.855 --> 04:18.492
[grunts]
<i>Dr.</i> Psycho!

04:18.591 --> 04:21.028
What an ugly baby
I have birthed.

04:21.127 --> 04:24.396
Does he taste like fudge?
In my dreams,
he does. [giggles]

04:24.497 --> 04:27.434
[Poison Ivy] Huh,
Harley's brain is much cleaner

04:27.533 --> 04:29.670
and less Harley-ish
than I would have imagined.

04:29.769 --> 04:34.440
I know! I know. Because this
is her Museum of Memories.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.444
Oh! Look.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.478
[Harley imitating female doll]
You came home late again, Nick,

04:39.478 --> 04:41.581
smelling like alcohol
and whore.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.050
[imitates male doll] She's just
a friend from work.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.884
Stop breathing down
my neck, Sharon.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.418
[imitates female doll]
Can't breathe down
what's not there,

04:46.418 --> 04:47.821
you cocksucker!

04:47.920 --> 04:49.956
[Laughing]
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

04:50.057 --> 04:52.992
It's pretty good scene work
for a six-year-old.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.829
I am honored to be
the valedictorian,

04:55.928 --> 04:59.899
and I just want to thank
absolutely no one.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.535
-Fuck all of ya!
-[crowd gasps]

05:01.535 --> 05:03.670
Fuck the principal.
Fuck the shop teacher

05:03.769 --> 05:06.372
that looks at my ass
every time I walk out of class.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.807
Yeah, I see you.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.976
-Have a great fucking summer!
-[crowd murmuring]

05:10.076 --> 05:12.379
I basically gave the same
speech at my sister's wedding.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.014
-Ah! Harley!
-Oh, hey, guys.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.583
Wait. How can Harley be in here

05:16.682 --> 05:19.653
if we're in Harley,
and if Harley is--

05:19.752 --> 05:22.355
Yeah, I wouldn't think too hard
about bringing logic
for the next 20 minutes.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.057
We're just here to give you
a hard reboot.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.625
-[King Shark] Ooh. Ow!
-Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, listen up.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.495
While I find the switch,
you follow hooker rules.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.130
-No kissing on the mouth?
-I'm sorry.

05:31.232 --> 05:32.499
Stripper rules.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.233
Look but don't touch.

05:34.235 --> 05:37.004
The brain will protect itself
if it feels threatened.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.505
Hey, Ive, I think there's
something really
screwed up about me.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.574
I want to say this in just
the most loving way,

05:41.675 --> 05:44.711
but, there's no way that this
is just occurring to you now?

05:44.711 --> 05:47.480
No, I mean, screwed up on top
of the regular screwed up.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.848
I mean, why can't
I make a decision?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.584
Well, we're in
your mind right now,

05:50.584 --> 05:53.052
so the answer has
to be here somewhere.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.687
[Harley] Oh, I remember this!

05:54.687 --> 05:56.990
Okay, it's when that bleached
asshole pushed me

05:56.990 --> 05:58.891
and bleached mine.
Look! Look!

06:00.694 --> 06:03.829
Hey, it glitched and skipped
over Joker pushing me.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.464
Wha-- It did it again.
Did you see that?

06:05.564 --> 06:06.833
Whoa, that's weird.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.601
It's like a piece
of your memory is missing.

06:08.601 --> 06:11.872
Ive, this is my origin story.
It says so right here.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.774
Look, your origin story's how
you become who you are.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.976
If it's screwed up,
no surprise I am.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.177
Ugh, let me see this.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.579
[laughs]

06:20.680 --> 06:22.749
Reboot time. [grunts]

06:22.848 --> 06:24.584
Um, I, uh, I wouldn't do that.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.052
I wouldn't-- Oh!

06:26.153 --> 06:27.687
-[alarm blaring]
-[grunts]

06:27.788 --> 06:30.490
[exclaims angrily]
No one listens to me!

06:30.490 --> 06:32.091
Who touched something?
Who did it?

06:32.192 --> 06:34.860
Was I not clear about
the stripper rule?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.562
I was just trying
to touch myself!

06:36.663 --> 06:38.031
That is a stripper rule.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.600
[grunts] You triggered
a brain lockdown.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.702
We need to get out
of here before--

06:42.802 --> 06:45.672
Ah! Before that happens.
Now we're trapped.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.007
[Sy] Now, this apartment's
a beaut.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.610
It's got a lot of light.
Perfect place for a fami--

06:51.711 --> 06:53.947
Jesus Christ!

06:54.048 --> 06:56.516
All right, the place isn't
ready. You'll come back
tomorrow. Tomorrow.

06:56.615 --> 06:58.918
Why aren't you moving?
Tomorrow, get out. Get out!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.553
-[baby crying]
-You forgot the baby!

07:02.956 --> 07:05.125
All right, let's see now.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.961
-Let's see. Why do they print
the numbers so small?
-[dialing]

07:09.062 --> 07:12.531
Black Mamba, this is Gerbil,
it happened again.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.737
No, no, no, no. The fuck?
Are we trapped in here?

07:17.737 --> 07:19.206
You need to tell me right now
if we're trapped in here!

07:19.206 --> 07:20.908
'Cause I'm gonna freak
the fuck out!

07:20.908 --> 07:22.276
What's gonna happen
to my plants, man?

07:22.276 --> 07:23.877
Girl, we need
to get you friends.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.180
"Oh, we wanna come with you.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.216
We're afraid you're gonna
mind molest her!"

07:29.216 --> 07:31.785
Now who's
the mind molesters? You!

07:31.884 --> 07:34.053
-[girl crying]
-You are the mind molesters!

07:34.153 --> 07:37.624
Ooh, are you lost, little girl?

07:37.723 --> 07:39.793
No need for tears, munchkin.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.161
I'll help you find your way.

07:41.262 --> 07:42.661
[growls]

07:42.762 --> 07:45.564
Ow! Oh! Oh! Get off me!
Oh, stop!

07:45.665 --> 07:47.860
This little child
is killing me!

07:48.769 --> 07:50.603
[grunts]

07:50.704 --> 07:52.805
Why did that sweet little you
attack me?

07:52.805 --> 07:55.975
Oh, yeah, I wasn't sweet at
that age. Or any age, really,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.011
but I was a total shit
back then.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.579
Which is why the brain sent it.

08:00.579 --> 08:02.081
It thinks we're intruders.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.017
And yes, if we die
in Harley's mind,

08:05.119 --> 08:06.887
-we die in real life!
-[bones cracking]

08:06.987 --> 08:09.290
[Clayface] Ooh,
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>
rules.

08:10.757 --> 08:15.028
[screaming]

08:15.028 --> 08:17.064
Do you have any insights
on what we should do here?

08:17.064 --> 08:19.266
-Run!
-[Dr. Psycho] Yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.800
[screaming]

08:20.901 --> 08:22.336
-[Clayface] Exit with alacrity.
-[shrieking]

08:24.737 --> 08:26.173
[shrieking]

08:28.841 --> 08:30.076
[Little Harleys shrieking]

08:30.076 --> 08:31.877
Harleys, this is Harley, stop!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.181
[shrieks]

08:36.682 --> 08:38.717
[screaming]

08:38.818 --> 08:40.321
[snarling]

08:40.421 --> 08:43.889
God, I hate brain physics.

08:43.889 --> 08:46.190
Hey, quit it and I'll tell you
where Mom hides the makeup.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.328
[shrieking]

08:48.428 --> 08:49.600
[Harley grunts]

08:49.600 --> 08:51.148
Damn it.
I was sure that was gonna work.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.932
Come on. Stop fucking around
and follow me.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.268
We got an elevator.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.303
[Little Harleys screaming]

09:00.974 --> 09:03.777
You know, in a way,
it's almost, like,
comforting to know

09:03.777 --> 09:05.644
that you've always been
this fucked up.

09:05.644 --> 09:08.248
Yeah, isn't it? You know,
I'm starting to realize
why my mother recycled

09:08.249 --> 09:09.899
so many wine bottles back then.

09:09.899 --> 09:12.152
Fun as this has been,
let's get the fuck out
of here, all right?

09:12.251 --> 09:13.899
There should be
an emergency exit

09:13.899 --> 09:15.822
to the real world
in Harley's subconscious
somewhere,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.657
which I think is this button

09:17.657 --> 09:19.158
[effort grunts]
right here.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.360
[grunts]

09:20.461 --> 09:22.296
-[growls]
-[screaming]

09:23.230 --> 09:25.664
[grunts]

09:25.764 --> 09:30.764
Okay, your stupid fin hit
the wrong button, dummy.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.739
[King Shark] Do not
fin shame me.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.109
[elevator bells dings]

09:37.744 --> 09:39.178
[all exclaim]

09:39.278 --> 09:41.315
He must have hit the button
to the optic nerve.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.051
Ooh, looking through
the eyes of another.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.052
Now it appears
we're playing by

09:46.153 --> 09:48.221
<i>Being John Malcovich</i>
rules.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.623
Another suicide cult.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.293
If word gets out,
I'll never be able to rent
this <i>fakakta</i> apartment.

09:53.394 --> 09:54.793
So let's make sure it doesn't.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.096
Where's the bleach
and the bone saw?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.166
No, no time for that.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.201
And I'm not paying
to re-carpet this place.

10:01.302 --> 10:04.270
-So we call our explosives guy.
-He exploded.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.874
Well, I guess eventually,
the worms will get us all.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.643
-[Sy] Oy.
-Jesus.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.346
Why not burn down the place
and take the insurance?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.780
A little Jewish lightning
never hurt anyone.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.950
A fire! Brilliant!

10:17.049 --> 10:19.919
We'll burn the bodies
in this old furnace I own!

10:20.019 --> 10:21.322
[Golda laughs] Oh, yes!

10:21.422 --> 10:23.990
There's the Sy who armed
Bin Laden in the '80s.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.958
-[chuckles]
-Let's do this.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.727
Close slutty Casper's eyes,
will ya?

10:28.828 --> 10:30.297
Feels like she's watching me.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.131
Sure thing, baby.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.667
[thuds]

10:33.767 --> 10:36.235
I can't believe Sy used
to be like a spy.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.071
-He's so--
-Gross.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.172
-You're looking for gross.
-[Poison Ivy] Yeah, that's it.

10:39.173 --> 10:40.407
What's "Jewish Lightning"?

10:40.508 --> 10:42.942
Perhaps Black Lightning's
Israeli cousin.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.279
Excuse me! But am I
the only one who heard

10:46.279 --> 10:48.981
that they're gonna burn
our fucking bodies?

10:49.081 --> 10:54.081
So, stop yapping
and do something!

11:00.494 --> 11:02.261
-[elevator dings]
-Harley,

11:02.363 --> 11:04.831
welcome to your subconscious.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.201
-Step right.
-Guess your Wi-Fi password.

11:07.301 --> 11:10.136
-Wack-an-insecurity.
-Try your hand at a game.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.004
Take your chance.
Step right up.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.840
Ugh, are you shitting me?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.174
So I'm gonna go out on a limb

11:15.274 --> 11:17.009
and say you're not
over your ex-boyfriend.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.745
I mean,
are you sure that this glitch

11:18.845 --> 11:20.246
is just
in your origin story?

11:20.346 --> 11:23.317
[chuckles] Yes, you,
young lady,

11:23.317 --> 11:24.783
the one with
the smeared lipstick

11:24.784 --> 11:27.221
who is still clearly
obsessed with me.

11:27.321 --> 11:29.556
Try your luck
at a game of skill?

11:29.557 --> 11:31.424
Win Daddy's Love!

11:31.424 --> 11:33.259
Yeah, don't bother
with that one.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.195
Oh, I know it's rigged.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.864
Come on! Everybody, spread out

11:37.964 --> 11:40.200
and just look for
the emergency exit, all right?

11:40.299 --> 11:44.203
[shrieking]

11:44.303 --> 11:45.471
Come on!

11:45.572 --> 11:47.408

12:21.508 --> 12:23.342
[all screaming]

12:26.614 --> 12:29.515
We are trapped!
What I wouldn't give

12:29.616 --> 12:32.018
for a <i>deus ex machina</i>
right now!

12:35.087 --> 12:37.124
Follow me. I know the way.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.393
Sorry, you didn't get
that <i>machina</i>
you were talking about.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.961
But at least,
that guy showed up

12:41.061 --> 12:43.163
out of nowhere to save us
for no reason.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.163
[Little Harleys screaming]

12:52.938 --> 12:56.208
Hey, hey, this is it!
Thank you for helping us...

12:56.309 --> 12:59.513
whoever the fuck you are.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.282
Oh, my God! It's 11-year old
Frankie Muniz!

13:02.381 --> 13:03.517
-Hi, Harley.
-[gasps]

13:03.616 --> 13:06.052
He knows my name.
I could die!

13:06.153 --> 13:07.321
Yeah, this isn't creepy.

13:07.421 --> 13:08.921
No, it's not like that at all.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.357
Yeah, you know, I had
a major crush on him
when I was a kid.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.360
Well, I guess that's different.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.028
Yeah, you know, I was planning
to kidnap him, marry him.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.831
Then once we hit puberty,
I was gonna tell him that I was
taking birth control, but then,

13:18.831 --> 13:20.082
like, not take it,

13:20.082 --> 13:22.269
-and I get pregnant
with his kid!
-Mmm-hmm.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.370
-And back to creepy.
-Yeah, I know what's
going on here.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.472
He was Harley's truest love.

13:26.474 --> 13:29.176
So, some small,
sane part of her brain sent

13:29.176 --> 13:30.610
her a vision of him to help us.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.613
That's right.
Good luck, Harley.

13:32.613 --> 13:34.980
BTW, all those
times you stared at

13:34.980 --> 13:37.149
my poster in your bedroom,
I was staring back.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.884
-I knew it!
-Take care.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.633
Let's go.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.855
There's two geriatrics trying
to burn our bodies

13:42.855 --> 13:44.157
before
<i>NCIS</i> comes on.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.193
[Sy] You know,
I forgot how much fun

13:47.293 --> 13:49.929
moving and then
destroying dead bodies is.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.465
Nothing gets the heart racing

13:51.565 --> 13:53.634
[gasps] like one that's stopped
completely.

13:53.734 --> 13:57.638
[chuckles] Ah, Golda.

13:57.738 --> 14:00.974
Do you ever regret not having
spy kids together?

14:01.073 --> 14:04.577
Nah. I have normal kids
and normal grandkids.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.647
-I lead a normal life now, Sy.
-[thuds]

14:06.746 --> 14:09.349
Ah, well, what if it's
not too late?

14:09.450 --> 14:12.251
Eh? I still have
my license to kill.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.019
That's your AARP card.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.291
Oh! Yeah, well, the kill thing
is in here somewhere.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.024
I may be old, Golda,

14:19.125 --> 14:21.562
but there's nothing
I can't handle.

14:21.662 --> 14:23.630
[both chuckle]

14:23.730 --> 14:25.532
Well, the neighborhood kids

14:25.633 --> 14:29.101
don't call me Old Scary
Machine Man for nothing.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.172
Now, there's a monster for you.
[chuckles]

14:32.272 --> 14:33.539
[grunting]

14:33.640 --> 14:35.643
Come on, get that piece
of rust working.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.412
Booyah!

14:38.511 --> 14:40.279
Up! Up! And--

14:40.379 --> 14:42.048
-[engine stops]
-Hey, I'm out of diesel.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.616
-[both scream]
-[crash]

14:45.251 --> 14:47.086
[Dr. Psycho] Come on, come on.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.556
They're probably heating up
the furnace right now.

14:49.657 --> 14:52.000
-Is that--
-Repressed Memory Island? Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.726
That's where you keep all
your screwed-up memories.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.462
Trust me, you do not want
to go anywhere near it.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.666
Ive, remember the glitch
in my origins story?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.100
Oh, so you think it's like

15:00.100 --> 15:01.467
a repressed memory
or something?

15:01.467 --> 15:03.269
Right. And it's on that island.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.626
Oh, then we gotta go.

15:04.626 --> 15:07.341
And what did I just say
about going to that island?

15:07.341 --> 15:08.775
We are all going
to be burned to death

15:08.775 --> 15:11.177
if we don't leave
your mind right now!

15:11.177 --> 15:13.312
Okay, fine. Then you go.
I'm not leaving.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.115
In the real world
I'm still catatonic,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.482
drooling all over myself.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.451
Okay, she made her choice.
Let's go.

15:18.552 --> 15:20.386
-I'm going with Harley.
-Of course you are.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.654
She's your only friend.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.590
That's true.
But that's by design,

15:23.591 --> 15:26.025
because she's the only
human being I think
is worth a shit.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.994
Hey, Clayface,
how many acting jobs

15:27.994 --> 15:29.596
did you get
before Harley gave you one?

15:29.697 --> 15:31.163
Well, I filled in for the dog

15:31.264 --> 15:34.100
that played Air Bud,
when he was run over

15:34.201 --> 15:37.504
by me the second
to the last day of shooting.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.105
-You know what? I'm in.
-And, Psycho,

15:39.206 --> 15:40.506
who took you in
when literally,

15:40.506 --> 15:42.174
the worst people
on the planet turned you away?

15:42.174 --> 15:44.043
Fine! I'm in.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.047
-And, King Shark, let's all
remember the time--
-I'm in!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.447
Oh, thank God,
'cause I had nothing.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.383
All right, Doctor,
help your patient.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.251
All right, all right,
all right, I got a plan.

15:52.351 --> 15:55.389
[Little Harleys]
We'll have fun!
Hey, come play with us.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.595
-[all laughing menacingly]
-[indistinct chattering]

16:01.595 --> 16:02.695
[Little Harley] We'll have fun.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.806
Come play with us.

16:04.806 --> 16:07.433
If I go down, I'm taking
all you little shits with me!

16:07.533 --> 16:11.238
Whoa! [yelling]

16:11.337 --> 16:13.038
That was not the plan!

16:13.038 --> 16:13.874
[Poison Ivy] We got
your back, Harls.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.609
Oh, you guys.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.309
[all snarling]

16:18.245 --> 16:21.394
[laughing menacingly]

16:26.754 --> 16:28.120
We might be fucked.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.590
You guys totally should
have left.

16:29.690 --> 16:32.458
[scoffs] Harley Quinn,

16:32.558 --> 16:36.096
it has been the utmost pleasure
to serve in your company.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.163
[Harley] Clayface, no!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.466
[Little Harley 1]
I love you, Frankie.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.567

Give me babies!

16:40.567 --> 16:41.869

16:41.869 --> 16:46.869
Well, hello, it is I,
Frankie Muniz!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.475
I love you, Frankie.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.344
[all yelling]

16:50.443 --> 16:51.677
Ah, screw this.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.277
Now, how the hell are we gonna
get to that island?

16:57.149 --> 17:01.355
I cannot believe this.
I mean, it is just the most
unlikely set of circumstances

17:01.455 --> 17:05.358
that would put me
about 70% shark, in a situation

17:05.459 --> 17:08.194
that pretty much demands
a mostly shark man.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.896
-[King Shark chuckles]
-[Harley] Oh, we made it!

17:09.896 --> 17:13.400
Is it me, or is it getting
kind of warm around here?

17:16.135 --> 17:18.404
Sy, the fire's good and hot.

17:18.505 --> 17:22.075
Then what are we waiting for!
Let's get to cremating!

17:22.174 --> 17:23.242
Cremate!

17:23.343 --> 17:25.311

<i>♪ We''re going in the fire ♪</i>

17:31.818 --> 17:33.554
Why does it look like Arkham?

17:33.554 --> 17:36.390
Because your sick brain
is trying to lock up memories

17:36.490 --> 17:39.259
so vile that you repress them,
so do not look--

17:39.358 --> 17:41.595
Okay, why do I even try?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.830
When's Daddy done
with his business meeting?

17:43.931 --> 17:45.332

17:47.867 --> 17:52.605
That's enough.

the restraining order again,

Muah! See ya soon, Frankie.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.416
So that's why I went to juvie.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.519
[maniacal laughter]

18:09.189 --> 18:12.358
[grunts]

18:12.392 --> 18:16.363
Here we are, puddin'.
Dive in as Harleen Quinzel,

18:16.462 --> 18:19.432
and rise as Harley Quinn!

18:19.532 --> 18:21.500
My beautiful creation.

18:21.602 --> 18:24.237
Okay, look, here it comes.
Here's when that piece of shit

18:24.336 --> 18:25.439
pushes me in he acid.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.442
[laughs] If you love me,
then jump!

18:28.541 --> 18:31.411
And you'll be mine forever.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.313
A dream come true, puddin'.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.215
Wait! No!

18:38.317 --> 18:40.854
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you okay?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.789
This whole time
I thought he pushed me.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.325
That it wasn't my choice.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.859
But it... it was.

18:46.961 --> 18:50.463
Whoa, so you told yourself
it was out of your control?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.664
Yeah, because it was easier

18:51.765 --> 18:53.467
to blame him than accept
the truth.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.501
And the truth being,
what, exactly?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.805
That it was always my choice.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.906
That I was in control
all along.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.509
And I still am.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.912
If you love me, then jump.

19:05.011 --> 19:08.882
And you'll be mine forever.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.517
-Hard pass.
-Wha-- what?

19:10.616 --> 19:11.951
I said no, idiot.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.453
But you have to jump,
you can't change this.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.390
I mean, it's already happened.
It's your origin story!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.459
Wrong.
It's not my origin story.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.227
My real origin story
didn't happen here.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.696
It happened in your lair.

19:23.797 --> 19:25.731
Uh, I wasn't
wearing this costume.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.064
And believe me,

19:27.064 --> 19:29.064
I wasn't saying
you were a dream come true.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.804
I was saying,
"Go fuck yourself!"

19:30.903 --> 19:33.673
Harley, stop this nonsense. I--

19:33.673 --> 19:36.241
I know you think
you created me, but no one did!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.510
My fucked-up parents
didn't make me the way I am.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.079
Neither did Jessica Sarner

19:40.079 --> 19:41.647
when she fucking lied
to the whole camp

19:41.647 --> 19:44.351
and said I lost my virginity
to a horse!

19:44.351 --> 19:45.751
-A horse!
-[grunts]

19:45.752 --> 19:47.721
Or, those cops
who questioned me for hours

19:47.721 --> 19:49.655
-about what happened
to Jessica Sarner.
-[grunts]

19:49.655 --> 19:51.023
And you sure as hell

19:51.025 --> 19:52.424
didn't fucking
create me, puddin'.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.894
Yeah? Well, I named you.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.864
You got Harley Quinn
out of Harleen Quinzel?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.565
Nice work, genius!

19:58.664 --> 20:00.867
[both grunt]

20:00.968 --> 20:03.604
You didn't make me, Joker.
I made myself.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.838
But you can't change
your memories!

20:05.940 --> 20:08.642
This isn't
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i> rules.

20:08.741 --> 20:09.876
[whooshing]

20:09.977 --> 20:11.243
[grunts]

20:12.712 --> 20:15.481
-[grunts]
-My mind. My rules.

20:16.817 --> 20:17.917
[clatters]

20:20.988 --> 20:22.990
[sighs] Sanity restored.

20:22.990 --> 20:26.326
Kinda. Thanks, gang.
I owe you everything.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.260
Has anyone seen Clayface?

20:28.260 --> 20:29.797
-[Little Harley grunts]
-[all exclaim]

20:29.896 --> 20:32.665
No! Because her little
psycho shits killed him!

20:32.665 --> 20:34.534
Did not!

20:34.634 --> 20:36.470
Apologies for the disguise.

20:36.470 --> 20:40.473
I had to "go native" to thwart
Harley's younger demons.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.977
Oh, we're just glad
you're alive.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.046
Thank you, frie--
Oh, I'm getting hard!

20:46.146 --> 20:47.713
-[all grunt]
-Please!

20:47.815 --> 20:50.483
My phallus is not erect.
It's my leg.

20:50.584 --> 20:51.818
Oh, no, he's in the furnace!

20:51.919 --> 20:54.654
Aah! Come on! Come on!
To the exit, now!

20:57.557 --> 20:59.759
And a one and a two--

20:59.859 --> 21:01.428
[all screaming]

21:01.528 --> 21:04.396
They're still alive.
Damn it, Sy.

21:04.498 --> 21:07.500
This is Peru all over again.
I'm outta here.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.736
What do you mean, "Outta here"?
Where're ya going?
Where're ya going?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.005
-I'm done with this shit.
-[Sy] Don't be done.

21:11.105 --> 21:12.705
We're in the middle of a thing.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.442
-No, I'm at the end.
-You were always a quitter!

21:15.442 --> 21:17.344
Oh, and you tried to kill us.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.413
Nonsense! What are you--
What are you doing?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.781
You looked cold.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.018
So I did what any
good citizen would do.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.086
I brought you to a dead mall

21:26.186 --> 21:28.788
and heated you up in
an abandoned pizza oven.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.557
You're welcome.
We're done here.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.393
This is it. Guys, we found it.

21:33.492 --> 21:34.862
What? Like hepatitis?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.730
No, our new lair.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.198
Look, it doesn't matter
what it is.

21:38.199 --> 21:39.866
'Cause the lair doesn't
define us.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.768
We define the lair.

21:41.769 --> 21:45.571
Uh-huh. Can we define
a different one?
This one's gross.

21:45.571 --> 21:47.807
No, this one's free.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.542
The hell it is.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.979
This premium
shopping destination

21:51.979 --> 21:54.614
runs 100 grand a month.

21:54.615 --> 21:57.616
I'm offering a dollar.
And I won't kill you right now

21:57.617 --> 21:59.352
for trying to burn us alive.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.721
Deal. On one condition.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.758
You let me come along
on some of your heists.

22:04.758 --> 22:08.729
Lugging around your dead husks
made me feel alive again.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.364
I want back
in the game, baby!

22:11.463 --> 22:13.000
Well, you did manage to carry

22:13.000 --> 22:15.769
six bodies to a pizza oven.
I mean, that's not nothing.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.804
-Deal.
-Hey!

22:17.805 --> 22:21.540
-Oh!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
It happens all the time.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.509
[Sy] Anyone have
a Philips head?

22:23.609 --> 22:28.609
