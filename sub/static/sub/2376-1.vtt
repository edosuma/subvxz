00:30.906 --> 00:33.079
GIRL: Oh, this
is a nice house, huh?

00:33.242 --> 00:35.002
- Hi! (CHUCKLES)
- BOY: Is that the daughter?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.753
GIRL: Where shall we park?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.912
- Uh, right here? I don't know.
- GIRL: Right here?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.541
- Hi.
- I'm Sarah.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.334
- Sarah, hi. I'm Mia.
- Hi, Sarah.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.128
You spoke to me
on the phone earlier.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.967
<i>- I'll</i> just give you a hug.
- Hi.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.847
- I'm glad you're here. Hi.
- Gavin.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.724
- This is Gavin and Luis.
- BOY: What's up?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.727
Do I look OK?
I gotta be all... tucked in.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.230
- LUIS: You look great.
- MIA: Sorry.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.858
I was gonna ask, do you
want me a certain way or...

00:58.016 --> 01:01.111
Um, no. Just... just be yourself.
Almost, like, ignore these guys.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.988
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.866
- They're invisible.
- Yeah, that'll be easy!

01:04.897 --> 01:06.616
- (CHUCKLES) 'Ignore'.
- Wow!

01:06.775 --> 01:10.075
Ma can come off kind of salty,
but it's all an act.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.955
- OK.
- She's excited you're here.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.832
She's been cleaning and dusting

01:13.991 --> 01:15.991
like the president's
coming to dinner or something.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.917
- (WIND CHIMES TINKLE)
- SARAH: Ma?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.922
Well, she was back here.
(LAUGHS)

01:21.081 --> 01:23.584
You have the grant money, right?
It said so on the flyers.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.377
- Yes.
- That's what we're counting on.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.262
No, no, definitely.
It's part of the deal.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.048
Roanoke will also
help underwrite

01:29.214 --> 01:30.841
some of the healthcare <i>costs</i>
as well.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.726
Oh, wow. I love Roanoke.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.683
Yeah, it... it has to be
the right fit, though.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.846
Of course.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.606
- Please and thank you.
- OK.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.483
Kiss her ass.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.690
- (LAUGHS) Smile.
- Point noted.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.106
I mean, I'm sorry.
You know all this.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.821
- Hey, Ma!
- MAN: Yes, you did.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.743
- MIA: Hello there!
- Oh, Harris is with her.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.578
- WOMAN: Hi. Oh, gosh.
- HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.660
- Those people are here.
- Hey, Sarah.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.824
- The crew I told you about.
- Nice to meet you.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.414
They're here for the pre-interview.
Remember, Ma?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.295
They wanna make
a movie about me!

02:00.454 --> 02:02.094
- Isn't that right?
- MIA: Yes, hopefully.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.587
- What do you think of that?
- I think it's a good idea.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.718
You do?
Well, we'll see.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.380
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm being
a bad hostess, aren't I?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.924
- Here. You take that.
- MIA: Do you need...

02:12.090 --> 02:14.184
I'm just gonna take this
and put this stuff away

02:14.343 --> 02:17.472
so that I have it
where it belongs for next time.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.561
Of course.

02:19.723 --> 02:23.444
What is of interest is that
this is of an educational nature.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.604
That interests me.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.569
Um...

02:27.731 --> 02:29.859
I'm not interested
in being exploited.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.572
Oh...

02:31.735 --> 02:33.487
I'm not the butt
of anyone's joke.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.372
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, Mom.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.283
Mrs. Logan, that is definitely
not why we'd be here.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.203
You know, actually
my grandfather had the disease

02:41.370 --> 02:43.964
so it's not just a grade for me.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.127
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.170
Well...

02:51.296 --> 02:54.971
...I am a very private person...

02:55.133 --> 02:58.012
...and, um...

02:58.178 --> 03:00.306
...I'm just having
second thoughts.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.476
I think that you would be better off
with someone else.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.521
I'm sorry. I know
you've driven a long way.

03:06.687 --> 03:11.659
But I don't think
I'm the candidate for you, so...

03:13.068 --> 03:14.786
Mom?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.697
MAN: What the fuck was that
about your grandfather?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.082
I thought they were on vacation
in New Zealand.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.243
She just needed
a little nudging.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.147
MAN: I thought you said
these people were broke.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.275
MIA: She's behind on the house,
but she won't sell,

03:45.434 --> 03:48.404
so Sarah's in a tough spot.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.630
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:14.796 --> 04:16.969
MIA: Guys, I want you to be
on good behaviour, OK?

04:17.132 --> 04:18.850
'Cause she's, like,
a proper old lady.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.978
So I don't wanna be,
like, hounding them.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.935
- Hey!
- Hi.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.474
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarah.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.734
- How's it going?
- I'm so glad you're here.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.941
Hello, hello. Welcome.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.698
I didn't know you guys were
gonna come in, like, right away.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.736
- Right, I know.
- We wanna capture it all, so...

04:36.902 --> 04:38.620
I paint in here mostly now

04:38.779 --> 04:40.702
because, you know,
we don't entertain.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.708
- She's an amazing artist.
- No, it's just a hobby.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.666
- I'm not an amazing artist.
- You're prolific. There's a lot.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.456
Oh, I used to know
the name of this bird.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.500
MAN: Looks like
a blue-tailed finch, actually.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.670
- Does it? Do you know birds?
- Oh, oh, dude, no.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.838
Well, maybe that is what it is.
I don't remember.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.757
Oh, is this Bavarian crystal?

04:58.924 --> 05:01.473
DEBORAH: It's better... Yeah,
it's probably better not to...

05:01.635 --> 05:04.229
Yeah, we won't be touching
the old things.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.140
You're a curious guy, huh?
You wanna touch everything?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.059
GAVIN: Do you guys have
a Starbucks in town?

05:09.226 --> 05:10.944
DEBORAH: Oh, no, no.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.230
This is Sarah's room.
You can just take a look.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.991
This was her room as a child.
She loved cars.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.324
We haven't touched anything
since she was a child.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.455
I kinda like
leaving it like this.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.207
She was a big ball player.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.084
I was never really
allowed in here.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.995
I guess you found your room.
(LAUGHS)

05:28.161 --> 05:30.255
- Oh, this is us?
- There's a blow-up mattress.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.791
- I'm sorry, this is a little...
- Yeah, this'll blow up.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.676
...a little more minimal,
a little rustic.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.515
(WHISPERS) Say thank you to her.
Thank you.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.263
- Oh, no, it's, uh...
- Say thank you.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.344
- Thank you.
- No, you have a different room.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.181
- Oh, I didn't know.
- There's no intermingling here.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.721
Boys, stay there.
And the door's closed.

05:45.887 --> 05:46.887
- Deborah?
- Yes?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.058
Thank you for your,
um <i>. .</i> hospitality.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.067
- Appreciate it.
- We're gonna have fun.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.819
- Right?
- Yeah, man.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.355
DEBORAH: OK, good.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.115
- My Aunt Edna's, um...
- This is amazing.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.118
Urn... What's this...
Bedroom set!

06:00.277 --> 06:02.405
- Careful with that, sweetheart.
- I know.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.494
Yeah, there.
That one's supposed to be there.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.124
GAVIN: Were you ever in Germany?

06:06.283 --> 06:07.830
DEBORAH: No, I have not.

06:07.993 --> 06:11.338
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.998
Remember?

06:13.164 --> 06:16.168
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?

06:16.334 --> 06:18.507
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.

06:18.670 --> 06:22.641
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?

06:22.799 --> 06:26.269
The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.183
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease

06:30.348 --> 06:32.271
not only destroys the patient,

06:32.434 --> 06:34.152
but has
a physiological influence

06:34.311 --> 06:36.029
on the primary caregiver.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.316
<i>Alzheimer's occurs when
abnormal protein fragments</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:42.326
<i>accumulate in the hippocampus,
killing neurons.</i>

06:42.485 --> 06:45.409
<i>The disease then creeps towards
the front of the brain,</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:47.532
<i>wiping out neurons responsible
for logical thought</i>

06:47.616 --> 06:49.334
<i>and problem solving.</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.415
<i>It then assaults
the sensory region,</i>

06:51.578 --> 06:53.706
<i>sparking terrifying hallucinations.</i>

06:53.872 --> 06:58.298
<i>Eventually, it erases a person's
oldest and most precious memories.</i>

06:58.460 --> 07:01.760
<i>In end stage, Alzheimer's
destroys the part of the brain</i>

07:01.922 --> 07:03.799
<i>that regulates the heart
and breathing.</i>

07:03.965 --> 07:07.435
<i>When swallowing goes,
death is not far behind.</i>

07:07.594 --> 07:10.188
- DEBORAH: Take this one off.
- SARAH: Huh?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.691
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.772
Let's just... Yeah.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.108
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, you always look so pretty.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.022
Whatever. OK, fine. Yep.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.736
- Thank you. That's great.
- Gone.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.401
Happy?
- I am happy-

07:22.567 --> 07:24.285
Awesome.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.287
DEBORAH: Is that
a shirt of your dad's?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.416
I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.498
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up

07:32.661 --> 07:36.040
and I'd put the... push it
back down again or something.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.924
Toast it twice.
Big deal.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.336
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.755
OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.389
DEBORAH: If you remember
your grandmother,

07:44.547 --> 07:46.015
she was frightening.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.097
She would leave a pot
on the stove

07:48.259 --> 07:50.728
until it melted right down
to the little glass top.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.764
- Maybe it's genetic.
- So that was a clue.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.649
I'm just saying what was a clue.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.231
Mia asked what's a clue for me,
and that was a clue.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.738
Alright. That was a clue.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.990
WOMAN: Deborah was exhibiting
what we call MCI-

08:02.148 --> 08:03.775
mild cognitive impairment.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.694
Through a battery of tests,

08:05.860 --> 08:08.204
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty

08:08.363 --> 08:11.207
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.210
MIA: How did she take the news?

08:14.369 --> 08:16.588
It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,

08:16.746 --> 08:20.421
but Deborah's not someone
to go down without a fight.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.211
<i>MIA: After the premature death
of her husband, Dennis,</i>

08:23.378 --> 08:25.096
<i>to a pulmonary embolism,</i>

08:25.255 --> 08:26.973
<i>Deborah was forced to provide
for two-year-old Sarah</i>

08:27.132 --> 08:28.850
<i>on her own.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:31.979
<i>She leveraged their house
as collateral and would go on</i>

08:32.136 --> 08:34.105
<i>to start a highly successful
switchboard answering service</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:36.015
<i>for the town of Exuma.</i>

08:36.182 --> 08:37.902
DEBORAH: That was the way
that professionals

08:37.976 --> 08:39.352
received their messages

08:39.519 --> 08:42.739
and, I guess, transferred information
back in those days,

08:42.897 --> 08:44.657
was through
a professional answering service.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.822
SARAH: Everyone told her
she was crazy at the time.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.505
- Right?
- DEBORAH: They certainly did.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.030
I was all alone
with a small child.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.039
SARAH: You can't tell Mom
not to do something

08:52.198 --> 08:54.318
'cause then she will absolutely
make sure she does it.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.248
- I was the nexus of this town.
- Yeah!

08:56.411 --> 08:59.335
Doctors, lawyers,
and Town Hall, everybody.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.922
Three-martini lunches
and affairs

09:03.084 --> 09:05.758
and philanderers
and alcoholics and...

09:05.920 --> 09:08.139
I had to cover
for all of these people.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.175
You didn't have to.
You chose to.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.343
Well, I did or they wouldn't
have stayed with me.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.887
- True.
- I wouldn't have had a business.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.601
You know.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.857
MIA: <i>As the days pass,
what becomes most apparent</i>

09:21.019 --> 09:23.738
<i>is there are no small tasks
for an Alzheimer's patient.</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:27.117
- WOMAN: $27.96.
- DEBORAH: 27?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.993
Let me see. Alright...

09:29.152 --> 09:31.826
OK, there's some of the change.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.956
- OK.
- I just need the dollars.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.833
Oh, right, OK.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.086
MIA: Maintenance of <i>daily</i> living
exacts a great toll

09:38.244 --> 09:41.373
<i>as organisational thinking
is compromised.</i>

09:41.539 --> 09:43.257
It didn't cook it
all the way through.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.339
