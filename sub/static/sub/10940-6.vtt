I could bring him out
tomorrow then.

07:49.212 --> 07:50.278
Yeah, sure.
That'd be great.

07:50.279 --> 07:52.747
Okay.
I'll see you then.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.585

being called a hero.

07:57.586 --> 07:59.554

No.

08:17.406 --> 08:18.804
You would have
to ask him.

08:18.805 --> 08:21.541
Besides, just because a girl
already has great clothes

08:21.542 --> 08:22.808
doesn't mean
she can't window shop.

There's something about this guy.

09:10.622 --> 09:11.989
He's got a look
about him,

09:11.990 --> 09:13.657
like he's guilty or something,
you know?

09:13.658 --> 09:16.025
Sure you're not projecting?

09:16.026 --> 09:17.060
Projecting?

09:17.061 --> 09:19.161
Like maybe you're the one
who feels guilty about something

09:19.162 --> 09:22.065
and you're blaming
someone else?

09:22.066 --> 09:23.399

You're not coming
to that polo match with me.

09:56.231 --> 09:58.099
Now, I didn't say that.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.167
Really?
You're gonna come with me?

10:00.168 --> 10:01.636
No.

10:01.637 --> 10:04.470
No, it's just...
Not my thing.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.905
You wouldn't wanna
try a different thing.

10:05.906 --> 10:06.906
Well, you know the saying.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.844
"It don't take a genius to
spot a goat in a flock of sheep."

10:10.845 --> 10:14.313
No, I have never heard
that saying before in my life.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.949
What I've heard?

10:17.018 --> 10:21.020
What I've heard
is "stick in the mud."

10:21.021 --> 10:22.387
Good night.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.759

I brought you a present.

10:47.012 --> 10:48.813
Now you have to come
to the rodeo.

10:48.814 --> 10:49.847
Let me guess.

10:49.848 --> 10:51.515
You have nowhere better
to be today?

10:51.516 --> 10:52.448
Nope.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.350
(Bucket clatters)

10:54.351 --> 10:55.618
I'll be right back.

11:05.396 --> 11:07.297

11:07.298 --> 11:10.032
My love life
is a mess.

11:10.033 --> 11:12.902
I was unaware you were
in possession of such a thing.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.170
Jake is driving me crazy!

11:14.171 --> 11:16.305
He follows me around
like a little puppy!

11:16.306 --> 11:17.406
Puppies can be cute

11:17.407 --> 11:19.141
if they're not chewing
on your shoes,

11:19.142 --> 11:21.877
or peeing on the floor.

11:21.878 --> 11:24.813
I need to know
how to get rid of him.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.948
How about saying,
"Jake, I'm sorry,

11:26.949 --> 11:29.483
but I don't want to hang out
with you anymore."

11:29.484 --> 11:32.653
Maybe that's how they used
in the Paleozoic ages, Jack,

11:32.654 --> 11:34.756
but nobody uses
the direct approach anymore.

11:34.757 --> 11:36.791
I need something more subtle,
more...

11:36.792 --> 11:38.426
What, underhanded?

11:38.427 --> 11:39.594
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Exactly.</i>

11:39.595 --> 11:41.862
And I'm sure you've got
a few break-up stories.

11:41.863 --> 11:42.863
Mm, tell the truth,

11:42.864 --> 11:44.932
I didn't break up
with that many girls.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.867
No, no, I meant all the girls
who broke up with you.

11:46.868 --> 11:47.868
There weren't that many.

11:49.503 --> 11:52.005
Come on, Jack,
I'm desperate.

11:52.006 --> 11:54.006
Please, just tell me
what they did.

11:55.076 --> 11:57.576
Well, there was this
one girl...

11:59.813 --> 12:00.880
Eleanor...

12:00.881 --> 12:03.883
I thought things
was hunky-dory, but...

12:03.884 --> 12:06.052
Then she started
to avoid me.

12:06.053 --> 12:09.956
Wouldn't make eye contact,
she wouldn't return my calls...

12:09.957 --> 12:12.023
Always had excuses
why she couldn't see me.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.125
Had to wash her hair;

12:13.126 --> 12:15.093
<i>Had to clean out her closet...</i>

12:15.094 --> 12:16.327
Brilliant!

12:22.401 --> 12:24.302
(Horse grunts)

12:24.303 --> 12:25.503
Rodriguez:
Come on, Venture.

12:25.504 --> 12:26.504
<i>Settle.</i>

12:26.505 --> 12:28.072
(Horse grunts heavily)

12:28.073 --> 12:29.339
Settle.

12:29.340 --> 12:32.209
Settle.
(Horse whinnies and grunts)

12:32.210 --> 12:34.145
Come on.
(Clicks tongue)

12:35.413 --> 12:36.380
Come on.

12:37.849 --> 12:39.183
Nice horse.

12:39.184 --> 12:40.317
How long've you him?

12:40.318 --> 12:42.987
Since I joined the force,
six years ago.

12:42.988 --> 12:44.487
That's a long time.

12:44.488 --> 12:46.722
Must break your heart
to think that he might retire.

12:46.723 --> 12:49.392
Well, could be
his time to go.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.894
I don't waste emotions
on a mode of transportation.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.130
<i>If my truck breaks down,</i>
<i>I get a new one.</i>

12:54.131 --> 12:57.934
(Door squeaks shut,
locks thud and clunk)

12:57.935 --> 12:59.035
<i>So, he's all yours.</i>

12:59.036 --> 13:01.837
Call me if you make
any progress.

13:01.838 --> 13:03.471
For sure.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.739
What a sensitive guy.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.108
No kidding.

13:16.451 --> 13:17.885
(Emotional breath)

13:22.757 --> 13:25.293
(Ignition turns,
engine rumbles)

13:31.079 --> 13:35.248
Good job, Mallory.
This is way more fun than camp.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.784
(Wheelbarrow clunks)

13:39.654 --> 13:41.555
Wanna come over
to my place?

13:41.556 --> 13:44.424
I could rope some calves
and you could watch.

13:44.425 --> 13:46.760
Can't.
I've got stuff to do.

13:46.761 --> 13:48.060
Like what?

13:49.128 --> 13:50.262
Like...

13:50.263 --> 13:51.931
Wash my hair.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.265
Oh.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.668
And I gotta clean out
my closet, so...

13:55.669 --> 13:57.436
Okay, then...

13:57.437 --> 13:59.038
See you later.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.141
(Wheelbarrow clunks
over ground)

14:04.142 --> 14:05.810
(Water sprays,
horse grunts)

14:06.979 --> 14:09.781
Easy...
Just a gentle spray.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.949
(Water sprays)

14:10.950 --> 14:12.149
Good boy.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.087
Good boy.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.521
Okay, that's good.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.123
You're a good boy.

14:19.124 --> 14:20.057
See?
It's not gonna hurt ya.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.995
All right,
let's try it again.

14:24.996 --> 14:26.362
Good boy...

14:27.632 --> 14:29.800
<i>Come on, boy,</i>
<i>let's go again.</i>

14:29.801 --> 14:31.568
Look!
It's not so bad.

14:32.637 --> 14:33.570
Come 'ere.

14:34.906 --> 14:36.472
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

14:38.709 --> 14:40.576
Come 'ere.
Look, I'll do it.

14:40.577 --> 14:42.878
Look, look.
See, you're okay.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.014
See that?

14:45.849 --> 14:48.050
It's okay.
Come here.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.352
Come on...

14:52.354 --> 14:53.254
It's okay.

14:54.824 --> 14:55.890
<i>He's not gonna do it.</i>

14:55.891 --> 14:57.425
Just let him relax.

14:59.728 --> 15:01.496
<i>Man 1:</i>
<i>There we, Davidson!</i>

15:01.497 --> 15:03.764
<i>Oh, hold on.</i>
<i>Get in there!</i>

15:03.765 --> 15:05.065
Man 2:
I got it!

15:05.066 --> 15:06.300
Man 1: All right. Stay on!

15:06.301 --> 15:08.169
Players: (Overlapping
shouts to each other)

15:08.170 --> 15:09.870
I'm just saving it...

15:16.910 --> 15:17.877
Scott.

15:19.247 --> 15:20.413
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:20.414 --> 15:21.314
Great to have you
on board.

15:21.315 --> 15:22.415
Good to be here.

15:22.416 --> 15:24.451
Our Club vet moved east
and uh...

15:24.452 --> 15:26.153
We've been struggling,
so...

15:26.154 --> 15:27.720
Good you could take over
on such short notice.

15:27.721 --> 15:29.289
I understand you put in
a good word for me.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.789
So, thanks for that.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.358
Don't thank me.
Thank Lou.

15:32.359 --> 15:34.460
She recommended you.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.369
(Rooster crows in the distance)

15:44.871 --> 15:45.971
Lou,

15:45.972 --> 15:47.505
have you seen
my favourite shirt?

15:47.506 --> 15:49.407
You know, the plaid one.

15:49.408 --> 15:52.143
Grandpa, all of your shirts
are plaid.

15:53.646 --> 15:54.745
Hi.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.880
Lisa.

15:55.881 --> 15:57.048
I didn't even know
you were here.

15:57.049 --> 15:58.516
I was just leaving.

15:58.517 --> 15:59.950
What's the hurry?

15:59.951 --> 16:01.619
Why don't you stay
for supper?

16:01.620 --> 16:04.854
Oh, that's nice.
I wou... I can't... I um...

16:04.855 --> 16:06.623
I have a thing
that I have to go to.

16:06.624 --> 16:07.891
I... so, I'll...

16:09.960 --> 16:10.860
<i>Bye.</i>

16:17.902 --> 16:20.102
What was that about?

16:20.103 --> 16:21.671
What was what about?

16:23.373 --> 16:25.074
Scott.

16:25.075 --> 16:26.209
Hi.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.443
Lou. Jack.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.748
Right.
Uh...

16:34.783 --> 16:36.651
Good to see you, Scott.

16:39.488 --> 16:40.722
(Half laughs)
Hi.

16:42.057 --> 16:43.325
- How are you?
- Um...

16:44.393 --> 16:45.993
Did I get the job
at the polo club

16:45.994 --> 16:47.028
because of you?

16:47.029 --> 16:49.063
You got the job?
That's great!

16:49.064 --> 16:50.964
(Sighs) Dammit...

16:50.965 --> 16:52.700
I wanna get the jobs
on my own merit.

16:52.701 --> 16:53.900
Hey, hold on...

16:53.901 --> 16:55.536
I was just doing you
a favour.

16:55.537 --> 16:58.205
Well, don't do me
any more favours.

16:58.206 --> 17:00.107
I want to know
that when get the job,

17:00.108 --> 17:01.242
it's because of me;

17:01.243 --> 17:02.243
Not because
of your relationship

17:02.244 --> 17:04.545
with the captain
of the polo team.

17:04.546 --> 17:06.213
Relationship?!

17:06.214 --> 17:08.615
What relationship?

17:08.616 --> 17:10.082
Scott! Wait!

17:11.618 --> 17:13.185
(Cell phone ringing)

17:20.527 --> 17:22.294
Are you gonna answer that?

17:22.295 --> 17:24.061
It's Jake.
I'm ignoring his calls.

17:24.063 --> 17:25.497
(Cell phone rings)

17:29.101 --> 17:30.034
Long story.

17:32.572 --> 17:34.906
(Half laughs)

17:34.907 --> 17:37.609
Hey, you think you'll have time
today to help me with Venture?

17:37.610 --> 17:39.543
Sure.
Yeah, I can do that.

17:39.544 --> 17:41.145
Not right now,
you don't.

17:41.146 --> 17:43.180
I need you to do
a supply run with me.

17:47.352 --> 17:49.420
I'll get him back
as quick as I can.

17:53.892 --> 17:56.326
Mrs. Bell:
(lndiscernible mumbling)

18:01.499 --> 18:03.132
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Mrs. Bell, nice to see you.</i>

18:04.435 --> 18:06.303
Whoa, whoa.

18:06.304 --> 18:08.471
My hip's a bit sore,

18:08.472 --> 18:10.806
<i>but other than that</i>
<i>I'm right as rain.</i>

18:10.807 --> 18:12.708
Thanks for asking.

18:15.312 --> 18:16.478
<i>Amy:</i> <i>I've given him</i>
<i>Star of Bethlehem</i>

18:16.479 --> 18:18.079
<i>for the initial shock</i>
<i>of the accident,</i>

18:18.080 --> 18:20.582
<i>and then lavender</i>
<i>to help him relax.</i>

18:20.583 --> 18:22.150
Mrs. Bell:
Here's lavender.

18:22.151 --> 18:24.353
It'll relax him

18:24.354 --> 18:27.555
and your mother swore
by Star of Bethlehem...

18:28.624 --> 18:30.257
Oh...

18:30.258 --> 18:34.429
And I have some...
Red Chestnut oil, too.

18:34.430 --> 18:35.830
It can help with anxiety.

18:35.831 --> 18:37.699
Thank you.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.899
(Half laughs)
Wow. Look.

18:41.837 --> 18:44.037
Sugarfoot's found a friend.

18:46.808 --> 18:48.542
Mrs. Bell, do you think
I could borrow Sugarfoot

18:48.543 --> 18:50.076
for a little while?

18:51.512 --> 18:53.647
Let's go.
Come on.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.148
(Clicks teeth,
urging Sugarfoot on)

18:57.418 --> 18:58.351
There ya go.

19:00.354 --> 19:02.521
<i>Come on, Venture.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

19:02.522 --> 19:03.522
<i>Let's go.</i>

19:04.924 --> 19:06.325
<i>Good boy.</i>

19:06.326 --> 19:08.327
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>What in the heck are you doing?</i>

19:08.328 --> 19:09.662
Amy: Well, Venture's
terrified of water

19:09.663 --> 19:11.330
so, I'm just getting him
over his fear.

19:11.331 --> 19:12.297
(Snorted chuckle)

19:12.298 --> 19:13.532
And look,
it's so cute.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.667
Sugarfoot and Venture
have really hit it off.

19:15.668 --> 19:18.169
Caleb: Oh yeah, that's uh...
It's cute.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.137
No listen.
It works because...

19:20.138 --> 19:22.974
Sugarfoot will go anywhere
for food...

19:22.975 --> 19:24.709
Good boy.
Here you go.

19:29.548 --> 19:33.316
<i>And Venture will go anywhere</i>
<i>to be with Sugarfoot.</i>

19:33.317 --> 19:34.651
(Water splashes)

19:34.652 --> 19:36.186
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>No offense,</i>

19:36.187 --> 19:37.688
but that's a puddle.

19:38.790 --> 19:40.491
Well, I'm building him up
gradually.

19:40.492 --> 19:41.558
I thought,
once I can saddle him,

19:41.559 --> 19:43.159
I'll take him to the stream.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.528
Why not saddle him up now?

19:45.263 --> 19:47.630
Rodriguez said that he wouldn't
let anyone ride him.

19:47.631 --> 19:48.964
So I thought I'd try join-up
tomorrow.

19:51.001 --> 19:52.869
(Leather saddle rustles)

19:54.471 --> 19:55.438
I wouldn't do that.

20:06.716 --> 20:08.016
(Saddle rustles)

20:09.685 --> 20:11.787
And you were saying?

20:13.890 --> 20:15.590
(Water flows gently)

20:15.591 --> 20:17.859
Amy: I wonder why Rodriguez said
that no one could ride Venture.

20:17.860 --> 20:22.296
Caleb: Well, maybe Venture's got
a weakness for a pretty face.

20:22.297 --> 20:23.764
Amy: Why don't you cross
the stream first.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.633
Yeah, sure thing.

20:27.302 --> 20:28.602
(Sugarfoot squeals)

20:28.603 --> 20:30.237
Come on,
you stubborn little thing.

20:30.238 --> 20:32.105
(Laughs) Here.
Try this.

20:36.209 --> 20:37.143
Apple.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.086
Amy:
(Laughs)

20:47.555 --> 20:50.989
He's used to getting his own way,
but he's hard not to like.

20:50.990 --> 20:52.858
Sorta like me.

20:52.859 --> 20:54.059
Oh, yeah. Right.

20:56.596 --> 20:58.196
Come on, you're okay.

20:58.197 --> 20:59.832
Your friend's over there.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.567
(Venture nickers)

21:01.568 --> 21:04.369
It's okay.
Come on, you can do it.

21:04.370 --> 21:06.771
(Venture whinnies,
Sugarfoot grunts)

21:07.940 --> 21:10.007
You're okay.
You're okay.

21:10.008 --> 21:12.076
Come on, you can do it.

21:12.077 --> 21:13.578
Good boy!
Good boy!

21:15.814 --> 21:16.981
<i>Good boy!</i>

21:18.450 --> 21:19.884
That's a good boy!

21:24.288 --> 21:25.421
There.
(Laughs)

21:27.191 --> 21:28.391
Thanks for helping me.

21:28.392 --> 21:30.426
It was my pleasure.

21:32.329 --> 21:34.531
Well, we should probably
head back.

21:34.532 --> 21:35.465
Yeah.

21:38.202 --> 21:39.702
<i>I gotta go see this horse,</i>
<i>uh...</i>

21:39.703 --> 21:41.737
Saturday night coming up.

21:42.906 --> 21:45.374
Would you like
to come with me?

21:45.375 --> 21:48.076
Could use your advice.

21:48.077 --> 21:48.978
Um... I...

21:50.279 --> 21:53.616
A simple "yes" or "no"
would do.

21:53.617 --> 21:54.516
Yes. Sure.

21:55.784 --> 21:56.484
(Giggles)

21:58.687 --> 22:00.421
What is this?

22:00.422 --> 22:02.991
"Hudson Rodeo Queen Hopeful?"

22:02.992 --> 22:04.993
I know.
My forehead's kinda shiny,

22:04.994 --> 22:08.129
but otherwise,
it's not a bad photo.

22:08.130 --> 22:09.497
Ashley.

22:09.498 --> 22:12.332
Please, tell me you're not going
through with this rodeo nonsense.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.901
Oh, but I am.

22:13.902 --> 22:15.869
Oh, so you won't be
needing Apollo anymore?

22:15.870 --> 22:19.072
Oh, I'm still jumping
for fun.

22:19.073 --> 22:20.073
(Disgusted laugh)

22:23.411 --> 22:25.679
Do have you any idea
how embarrassing this is?

22:25.680 --> 22:26.846
For who?

22:29.883 --> 22:32.051
(Paper thunks on the ground)

22:34.287 --> 22:35.154
Amy:
Hey, Ty!

22:36.924 --> 22:38.524
Ty, we got Venture
to cross the stream.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.594
And Caleb saddled him up,
no problem.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.061
Yeah, well,
the boss is watching.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.996
Better go do
my real job.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.064
Jack:
Aw, ya think?

22:46.065 --> 22:47.432
(Feedbags rustle)

22:48.568 --> 22:49.801
So I think I'm gonna
call Rodriguez,

22:49.802 --> 22:51.036
have him come over
and ride Venture.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.239
That simple?

22:55.240 --> 22:56.541
Why not?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.142
Well, maybe it's too fast.

22:58.143 --> 22:59.342
Oh, I don't think so.

22:59.343 --> 23:00.343
You should've seen him
following Sugarfoot.

23:00.344 --> 23:03.614
Th w went right through
the deep water.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.817
Thought you were gonna wait?

23:06.818 --> 23:08.351
I'm sorry,
I just...

23:08.352 --> 23:09.587
Whatever.

23:14.858 --> 23:17.426
Scott, call me.
We need to talk.

23:21.164 --> 23:23.032
Well, hello there.

23:23.033 --> 23:23.967
Hi...

23:25.035 --> 23:26.469
Hey, Constable.
Thanks for coming.

23:27.605 --> 23:29.205
- Sure.
- See ya.

23:29.206 --> 23:30.839
<i>Rodriguez:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:42.418 --> 23:43.351
So once you've got him
saddled up

23:43.352 --> 23:45.854
<i>we'll head to the stream.</i>

23:47.789 --> 23:48.856
(Venture grunts nervolyly)

23:53.595 --> 23:55.863
Amy:
Easy... easy...

23:55.864 --> 23:57.765
<i>Rodriguez:</i>
<i>Agh!</i>

23:57.766 --> 23:59.834
(Venture grunts nervously)

24:01.503 --> 24:02.302
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Easy.</i>

24:05.239 --> 24:06.940
Rodriguez:
I give up.

24:06.941 --> 24:08.541
I knew this wouldn't work.

24:08.542 --> 24:11.377
Caleb saddled him up
no problem.

24:11.378 --> 24:12.311
Here.

24:15.582 --> 24:16.716
(Venture grunts)

24:19.252 --> 24:20.819
Easy...
Steady, boy.

24:22.555 --> 24:23.555
(Venture grunts nervously)

24:23.556 --> 24:24.757
Whoa...

24:24.758 --> 24:26.659
Easy...
Easy, boy.

24:26.660 --> 24:27.893
Whoa...

24:27.894 --> 24:28.994
(Venture grunts)

24:33.667 --> 24:35.667
I don't get it.
I rode him for hours.

24:35.668 --> 24:37.068
All right, well,

24:37.069 --> 24:40.404
call when you've got
some real news, okay?

24:57.388 --> 24:58.354
<i>Soraya:</i>
<i>I should just drop out.</i>

24:58.355 --> 25:00.122
Like I stand a chance
against Ashley.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.590
And what good does
dropping out do

25:01.591 --> 25:03.492
except give Ashley
a better shot?

25:03.493 --> 25:05.161
Good point.

25:05.162 --> 25:06.996
Oh, I almost forgot
to tell you.

25:06.997 --> 25:10.099
I told my mom about that RCMP guy
you're working with.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.167
And she said she remembered
reading about him

25:11.168 --> 25:12.702
and his brother
a long time ago.

25:12.703 --> 25:14.670
It's so sad.

25:14.671 --> 25:15.704
What? What's sad?

25:17.506 --> 25:20.108
<i>(Approaching footsteps)</i>

25:20.943 --> 25:21.876
Hey.

25:22.978 --> 25:24.478
Hey.

25:24.479 --> 25:25.546
(Latch clicks)

25:28.250 --> 25:30.685
You know how you said there was
something about Rodriguez...

25:30.686 --> 25:32.820
You know, that...
That look he had?

25:32.821 --> 25:33.787
Yeah.

25:33.788 --> 25:35.155
Well, you're right.

25:35.156 --> 25:38.092
There is something
going on.

25:38.093 --> 25:39.960
I didn't tell you this,
but...

25:39.961 --> 25:41.294
That first day,
when he was leaving,

25:41.295 --> 25:45.065
he got in his truck
and he was really, really upset.

25:45.066 --> 25:46.200
Really?

25:46.201 --> 25:48.167
Yeah.
Look at this.

25:53.406 --> 25:54.907
Six years ago,

25:54.908 --> 25:57.243
right after he joined
the RCMP,

25:57.244 --> 25:59.411
his younger brother drowned.

25:59.412 --> 26:01.313
In Sheep River.

26:01.314 --> 26:03.414
This is where he rescued
that kid.

26:03.415 --> 26:05.583
Yeah. Exactly.

26:05.584 --> 26:08.754
(Sighs) He was there
when his brother died.

26:08.755 --> 26:10.455
So was Venture.

26:12.759 --> 26:15.593
I think I know
what I have to do now.

26:15.594 --> 26:17.362
Can you help me?

26:23.844 --> 26:26.612
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Yeah, sounds great, Lisa.</i>

26:26.613 --> 26:28.814
Mm-hm.
I have to run.

26:29.315 --> 26:30.983
Okay. Bye.

26:31.484 --> 26:32.952
You were talking
to Lisa?

26:32.953 --> 26:34.053
Mm-hm.

26:34.054 --> 26:35.687
She didn't wanna
talk to me?

26:35.688 --> 26:36.722
Guess not.

26:36.723 --> 26:37.155
(Kiss)

26:41.026 --> 26:41.993
(Sighing)

26:43.662 --> 26:45.797
(Muttering)
High school all over again.

26:45.798 --> 26:47.698
(Phone keypad beeps)

26:52.171 --> 26:53.771
(Cell phone ringing)

26:57.508 --> 26:59.243
I'd like to thank you,
Jack.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.178
I've done everything
yove told me to.

27:01.179 --> 27:03.613
No eye contact,
lame excuses...

27:03.614 --> 27:05.282
Ignoring his phone calls.

27:05.283 --> 27:08.885
Mallory, I am sorry
I ever told you that story.

27:08.886 --> 27:11.520
And I sure as heck do not
condone what you're doing.

27:11.521 --> 27:12.822
Well, I'd love to stay
and chat,

27:12.823 --> 27:14.123
but I gotta go
finish my chores

27:14.124 --> 27:17.193
at the Heartland
child labour camp.

27:17.194 --> 27:19.595
(Door squeaks open and closed)

27:24.567 --> 27:26.902
Okay.
I have something to say.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.005
First of all,
polo players are loaded.

27:30.006 --> 27:31.239
And if you think
for a moment

27:31.240 --> 27:32.607
they would let someone
treat their horses

27:32.608 --> 27:34.276
who they didn't trust
100 percent?

27:34.277 --> 27:35.643
You're crazy.

27:35.644 --> 27:38.479
- Lou...           - And yes,
Nick told me they needed a vet.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.148
And yes, I praised you
to the skies.

27:40.149 --> 27:41.282
Why wouldn't I?

27:41.283 --> 27:42.616
But your reputation
did the rest.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.652
So, whatever your reasons are
for not talking to me,

27:45.653 --> 27:48.088
this can't be
one of them.

27:48.089 --> 27:49.523
I'm sorry.

27:49.524 --> 27:51.658
And there is no relationship
between me and Nick, okay?

27:51.659 --> 27:52.827
None!

27:52.828 --> 27:54.094
<i>Nick:</i>
<i>Hey, Lou!</i>

27:54.095 --> 27:56.963
Am I still gonna see you
at the match tomorrow?

27:56.964 --> 27:58.531
Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.

27:58.532 --> 28:00.666
Good.
Looking forward to it.

28:00.667 --> 28:01.600
Scott.

28:05.039 --> 28:06.806
(Snorted breath)

28:12.012 --> 28:13.946
(Frustrated groan)

28:17.550 --> 28:18.616
<i>Jake:</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

28:18.617 --> 28:19.852
(Startled breath)

28:19.853 --> 28:22.221
I think the ringer
on your phone's off.

28:22.222 --> 28:25.290
Jake, it's not off!
I'm ignoring you!

28:25.291 --> 28:26.291
Why?

28:26.292 --> 28:28.727
You're driving me crazy!

28:28.728 --> 28:29.927
I'm sorry,

28:29.928 --> 28:32.563
I just don't like you
the way you like me.

28:32.564 --> 28:35.666
Just leave me alone,
okay?

28:35.667 --> 28:37.168
Not a problem.

28:46.244 --> 28:47.310
(Water rushes)

28:49.046 --> 28:52.015
Ty: I don't think this
is such a good idea.

28:52.016 --> 28:53.816
Amy:
Well, let's try it.

29:00.524 --> 29:02.191
Why did you wanna
come back here?

29:02.192 --> 29:04.760
Well, if we can get Venture
to even walk close to the river,

29:04.761 --> 29:07.396
keep him calm,
prove to him that it's safe,

29:07.397 --> 29:09.932
then he'll start to get over
his fear of water.

29:09.933 --> 29:11.267
See, watch.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.705
(Panicked grunts and nickers)

29:19.808 --> 29:21.842
Amy: Whoa, easy... It's okay.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.677
(Horse whinnies)

29:23.678 --> 29:24.612
Easy.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.382
See?
He remembers.

29:28.784 --> 29:30.818
A horse remembers?
Right.

29:30.819 --> 29:32.086
He does!

29:32.087 --> 29:34.388
I think Venture's fear of water
is all about this place.

29:34.389 --> 29:36.623
And the accidents.

29:36.624 --> 29:38.658
Forget it. Let's go.
Come on.

29:38.659 --> 29:40.493
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Hey, give Amy a chance!</i>

29:40.494 --> 29:41.861
Amy: I don't think
Venture's fear of water

29:41.862 --> 29:43.763
is about the boy you rescued.

29:43.764 --> 29:46.199
I think it's about what
happened here six years ago...

29:46.200 --> 29:47.935
To you.

29:47.936 --> 29:49.468
What did you say?

29:49.469 --> 29:51.003
Your brother.

29:52.172 --> 29:53.105
Joe...

29:54.274 --> 29:55.174
Happened here,
didn't it?

29:58.211 --> 30:00.779
Where do you get off looking
into my private life, huh?

30:00.780 --> 30:01.914
You had no right.

30:01.915 --> 30:03.215
I'm just trying
to do my job.

30:03.216 --> 30:04.350
There is no more job,
miss Fleming.

30:04.351 --> 30:05.783
This is over.
You got that?

30:05.784 --> 30:06.818
This is over.

30:06.819 --> 30:08.519
(Clicks tongue)
Come on!

30:08.520 --> 30:09.421
<i>Let's go!</i>

30:14.860 --> 30:16.794
(Amy clicks tongue)

30:23.768 --> 30:26.337
I did it!
I ditched Jake.

30:26.338 --> 30:28.472
Your mental cruelty
paid off?

30:28.473 --> 30:30.441
No, that went
right over his head.

30:30.442 --> 30:33.077
I just told him I didn't want him
hanging around all the time.

30:33.078 --> 30:35.112
So, you took
the direct approach.

30:35.113 --> 30:37.213
Frankly, it would've saved
a lot of time and energy

30:37.214 --> 30:39.849
if you were to just recommend
that to me in the first place.

30:39.850 --> 30:42.718
Now just you wait a minu-
I did!

30:42.719 --> 30:43.919
Whatever!

30:46.991 --> 30:48.257
(Metallic clang)

30:52.662 --> 30:54.597
(Truck rumbles)

30:59.769 --> 31:00.935
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

31:00.936 --> 31:02.371
Okay,
what's going on?

31:02.372 --> 31:03.838
This isn't high school,
Lisa.

31:03.839 --> 31:05.173
Excuse me?

31:05.174 --> 31:07.342
If you don't want to see me
anymore,

31:07.343 --> 31:08.543
just... say so.

31:10.613 --> 31:14.116
You're right.
I have been avoiding you.

31:14.117 --> 31:16.884
I think I did something
you won't like.

31:16.885 --> 31:18.752
But in my defense...

31:18.753 --> 31:21.522
Oh, it was a good idea
at the time.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.527
(Car door shuts)

31:26.528 --> 31:29.263
I had it made for you.

31:29.264 --> 31:30.431
That's why your shirt
was missing,

31:30.432 --> 31:32.765
because Lou helped me
"borrow" it

31:32.766 --> 31:35.301
to get your measurements.

31:35.302 --> 31:38.604
But I already own
a good suit...

31:38.605 --> 31:41.274
It's a forty-year-old relic.

31:42.843 --> 31:45.111
I just thought if you had
a good new suit,

31:45.112 --> 31:47.813
then you wouldn't feel
like a sheep among the goats.

31:47.814 --> 31:50.115
Goat amongst the sheep.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.184
And then I picked it up
and I started to worry

31:52.185 --> 31:53.952
that you would think
that I'm trying to change you,

31:53.953 --> 31:55.354
and I'm not.

31:56.489 --> 31:57.989
And you don't have to go
to a polo match

31:57.990 --> 31:59.624
if you don't want to.
It's your choice,

31:59.625 --> 32:01.560
and I'm okay with it.

32:02.662 --> 32:05.629
I appreciate the thought,
Lise,

32:05.630 --> 32:07.631
and it's a beautiful suit...

32:07.632 --> 32:09.133
It is!

32:09.134 --> 32:11.169
I use my suit
for two things:

32:11.170 --> 32:13.471
Weddings and funerals.

32:15.307 --> 32:20.343
It's a lovely gesture,
but I'm still not gonna go.

32:20.344 --> 32:21.278
Okay.

32:23.047 --> 32:25.648
Well...
You should have it.

32:27.785 --> 32:29.352
It was made for you.

32:39.963 --> 32:41.730
(Sighs)

32:41.731 --> 32:43.966
Is he ready to go?

32:43.967 --> 32:44.900
No.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.870
What do you mean, no?

32:48.871 --> 32:51.039
Constable Rodriguez...

32:51.040 --> 32:52.607
What I did yesterday,
it...

32:52.608 --> 32:54.209
It wasn't fair.
I should've warned you.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.111
Yeah. You're damn right
you should've.

32:56.112 --> 33:00.315
I know you love that horse,
and no matter what you say.

33:00.316 --> 33:03.751
And Venture,
he loves you, too.

33:03.752 --> 33:05.953
And he does remember.

33:08.023 --> 33:11.258
That recent accident
just brought it all back.

33:11.259 --> 33:13.494
I'm sure for you too.

33:17.698 --> 33:20.267
Just let me try
one more thing.

33:20.268 --> 33:21.268
Please?

33:25.782 --> 33:27.683

Stay on him, Gary!

33:42.498 --> 33:43.665
(Snorted half laugh)

33:43.666 --> 33:45.367
Hi.
(Kiss)

33:45.368 --> 33:46.801
Look at you,
you look lovely.

33:46.802 --> 33:49.404
Thank you,
so do you.

33:49.405 --> 33:51.172
Did Jack come with you?

33:51.173 --> 33:53.375
I'm sorry, Lisa.
He being pig-headed.

33:53.376 --> 33:55.209
Mm-hm.

33:55.210 --> 33:56.643
And he is not the only one.

<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Huh...</i>

34:01.048 --> 34:03.316
Where are you two at
these days?

34:03.317 --> 34:05.051
Your guess
is as good as mine.

34:05.052 --> 34:08.554
Well, they certainly
keep us guessing, don't they?

34:08.556 --> 34:11.725
(Overlapping chatter,
light music plays)

34:14.428 --> 34:16.529
Ashley: Barrel racing.
It's a total rush!

34:16.530 --> 34:18.498
I mean, I can't even
begin to describe

34:18.498 --> 34:20.132
<i>the buzz it gives me!</i>

34:20.132 --> 34:21.634
Caleb here
is giving me my lessons,

34:21.635 --> 34:23.735
and in a couple of weeks
I'll have my first rodeo,

34:23.737 --> 34:24.837
you should come and watch.

34:24.838 --> 34:26.438
Hey, Mrs. Stanton.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.440
Lovely to see you.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.139
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

34:32.244 --> 34:33.812
How dare you bring that...

34:33.813 --> 34:35.213
That stable hand here

34:35.214 --> 34:37.681
and talk about your trailer
trash pursuits at my club!

34:37.683 --> 34:41.152
Fine!
I'll stop talking about it.

34:41.152 --> 34:43.987
As long as I get
to keep Apollo.

34:43.989 --> 34:47.757
Ashley,
I will not be blackmailed.

34:47.759 --> 34:48.692
Okay.

34:50.495 --> 34:53.697
Have I told you
that I started barrel racing?

34:53.697 --> 34:55.900
And Caleb here's
teaching me.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.835

I'm very glad
you're here.

35:18.621 --> 35:21.122
Well, Lise, we're uh...

35:21.123 --> 35:22.390
We come from
different worlds,

35:22.391 --> 35:25.160
you and me.

35:25.161 --> 35:28.430
I'm the fish stick

35:30.032 --> 35:31.299

Stop it,
you're making me hungry.

35:35.771 --> 35:39.139
- I just didn't...
- I don't Wanna change you one bit.

35:39.140 --> 35:42.109
I like you
just the way you are.

35:42.110 --> 35:44.779
Maybe a little less stubble
for the club, eh?

35:44.780 --> 35:46.481
Kidding.
You look so handsome.

35:57.124 --> 35:58.291
It's called "join-up".

35:58.292 --> 35:59.659
You have to make yourself
the aggressor.

35:59.660 --> 36:01.761
Just drive him around using big
exaggerated motions

36:01.762 --> 36:03.763
and make sure
to keep him moving.

36:03.764 --> 36:05.498
What good'll that do?

36:05.499 --> 36:07.233
Well, it just shows him
you're the leader;

36:07.234 --> 36:09.068
That he can trust you.

36:09.069 --> 36:10.470
He'll choose to either
stay on the rail,

36:10.471 --> 36:12.405
or come in the center
to be with you.

36:12.406 --> 36:14.107
(Horse nickers)

36:14.108 --> 36:16.242
See, right now he's confused.

36:16.243 --> 36:18.311
He...
He feels that you're upset

36:18.312 --> 36:19.879
and that's why
he won't let you ride him.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.279
He just doesn't understand
what he did wrong.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.349
This is such
a load of crap.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.818
