00:09.696 --> 00:11.563
BARKLEY:
<i>Seven minutes. Is this right?</i>

00:11.631 --> 00:13.476
SAILOR: Aye, sir. Seven minutes.
- Unacceptable.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.311
This is a military ship,
not a homecoming dance.

00:15.335 --> 00:16.568
Captain.

00:16.603 --> 00:18.136
Report.

00:18.205 --> 00:20.138
The staff is locked
and we're holding steady.

00:20.207 --> 00:21.851
When do the SEALs get back
from their dive?

00:21.875 --> 00:23.775
They still have another
15 minutes, Captain.

00:23.844 --> 00:25.376
This is Weapons Officer Hardy.
Go.

00:25.445 --> 00:26.878
BARKLEY:
As soon as they return,

00:26.947 --> 00:28.547
I want to run another
missile drill test.

00:28.615 --> 00:30.215
It shouldn't take
seven minutes to...

00:30.283 --> 00:32.417
HARDY:
Captain.

00:32.485 --> 00:34.252
Got a problem at
the escape trunk.

00:34.321 --> 00:37.489
XO, you have the Conn.

00:39.459 --> 00:41.593
Come on, Mike,
stay with me.

00:41.661 --> 00:43.061
What the hell
happened out there?

00:43.129 --> 00:44.629
I don't know.

00:44.698 --> 00:46.264
Doctor's on his way.
Sit-rep.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.133
It was a routine dive, sir.
Doesn't look routine.

00:49.202 --> 00:51.302
I went out first. Got about
20 yards and looked back.

00:51.371 --> 00:52.482
White was just floating there.

00:52.506 --> 00:53.950
By the time I got back
to him, he was...

00:53.974 --> 00:56.341
Sir...

00:56.409 --> 00:58.510
He's gone.

01:02.983 --> 01:06.983

(grunts)

01:44.190 --> 01:46.291
Ah, they really need
to make these doorways bigger.

01:46.359 --> 01:47.359
Hey, uh, where's Gibbs?

01:47.427 --> 01:48.893
Talking to the CO.

01:48.962 --> 01:51.529
Now it's time for
you to talk to me.

01:51.598 --> 01:53.398
Who do we have here?

01:53.466 --> 01:57.135
Well, Petty Officer
Robert White.

01:57.203 --> 01:59.237
And I hope he's a fast talker.

01:59.306 --> 02:01.072
Yeah, me, too.
I have a whole list full

02:01.141 --> 02:03.541
of events planned
for Dr. Mallard's last day.

02:03.610 --> 02:04.921
If you want to see him
before he leaves,

02:04.945 --> 02:06.210
let's make this quick, okay?

02:06.279 --> 02:08.179
Hey. You doing okay?

02:08.247 --> 02:09.913
Yeah. Just not a big fan

02:09.983 --> 02:12.216
of being underwater these days,
you know, so...

02:12.285 --> 02:14.096
Oh, that's right.
And now you're basically trapped

02:14.120 --> 02:15.887
on a big, giant
underwater coffin.

02:15.956 --> 02:17.355
Not helping.

02:17.424 --> 02:19.424
Look, we are gonna be fine,
all right?

02:19.492 --> 02:21.025
This baby is indestructible.

02:21.094 --> 02:23.027
And if anything were
to go wrong with the boat,

02:23.096 --> 02:24.762
Bishop, good news,

02:24.831 --> 02:26.431
we'd be dead before you know it.

02:26.499 --> 02:27.932
Okay. So it's times like these

02:28.001 --> 02:29.500
I'm really gonna miss Ducky.

02:29.569 --> 02:31.502
Yeah, tell me about it.
(sighs)

02:31.571 --> 02:33.838
Rather you tell me
about our petty officer.

02:33.907 --> 02:35.506
Oh. Uh, okay.

02:35.575 --> 02:37.241
Finished BUDS
six months ago.

02:37.310 --> 02:40.078
His SEAL team was hitching a
ride for a training exercise

02:40.146 --> 02:43.615
and this was his first trip
out on a Virginia-class.

02:43.683 --> 02:45.883
Sadly, his last.
Cause of death?

02:45.952 --> 02:49.087
The frothing around the nose and
the cyanosis suggest drowning.

02:49.155 --> 02:50.566
Along with the ocean
he was dragged out of.

02:50.590 --> 02:51.767
But I'll have to take him back

02:51.791 --> 02:52.991
for an autopsy
just to confirm.

02:53.026 --> 02:54.292
GIBBS:
Okay, Palmer,

02:54.361 --> 02:56.294
get the body back to NCIS.
Bishop...

02:56.363 --> 02:57.729
Go with him?
Interviews.

02:57.797 --> 02:59.764
(groans) Okay.

03:01.601 --> 03:06.070
How does a U.S. Navy SEAL
drown during a routine dive?

03:06.106 --> 03:08.873
That's a good question.

03:08.942 --> 03:11.409
All right, Jimmy's on his
way back with the body.

03:11.478 --> 03:13.244
Gibbs and Bishop
are staying on the sub.

03:13.313 --> 03:15.380
Man, Bishop ain't
gonna like that.

03:15.448 --> 03:18.950
Yeah. Nor do I. It means I won't
be able to say good-bye to them.

03:19.019 --> 03:21.619
McGee, gingerbread latte,
extra whipped cream.

03:21.688 --> 03:23.121
Enjoy.
Thank ya.

03:23.189 --> 03:25.556
Does Gibbs suspect foul play?

03:25.625 --> 03:27.792
Does he ever not?
Ah, good point.

03:27.861 --> 03:29.505
TORRES: Well, at least you'll be able
to spend a few more hours

03:29.529 --> 03:31.763
with Jimmy before you leave.

03:31.831 --> 03:33.831
Ah, we're really gonna miss you
around here, Duck.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.977
I still can't believe
it's your last day.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.467
I prefer to think of it

03:36.536 --> 03:38.970
as the first day
of the rest of my life.

03:39.039 --> 03:40.304
What happens on the second day?

03:40.373 --> 03:41.773
Stay tuned. (chuckles)

03:41.841 --> 03:45.576
Well, I know exactly what
I'm gonna do when I retire.

03:45.645 --> 03:50.281
Buy a beach bar. Surf all day,
and margaritas till sun-up.

03:50.350 --> 03:52.116
Oh, man, I can definitely
get behind that.

03:52.185 --> 03:53.251
You surf, Nick?

03:53.319 --> 03:54.363
I was talking about
the margaritas.

03:54.387 --> 03:56.487
Ah.
But, honestly, I, uh,

03:56.556 --> 03:58.134
I've never really thought
about retirement.

03:58.158 --> 04:01.092
Well, that definitely sounds
like a surfer's mentality.

04:01.161 --> 04:02.281
Nick, you gotta get on that.

04:02.328 --> 04:03.461
I mean, I've
been saving

04:03.530 --> 04:06.097
for my retirement
since I was 14 years old.

04:06.199 --> 04:07.665
Oh, yeah,
but you also have issues.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.467
SLOANE: And that's
my cue to leave.

04:09.536 --> 04:12.170
I was never a big fan
of <i>The Odd Couple.</i>

04:13.573 --> 04:15.339
Hey, you do know
that you need money

04:15.408 --> 04:17.274
to live on once you
stop working, right?

04:17.343 --> 04:19.510
Look, man,
I-I've been saving, okay?

04:19.579 --> 04:21.178
But I-I'm saving
like a normal person.

04:21.247 --> 04:22.758
Like, a little bit here
and there, you know?

04:22.782 --> 04:25.116
I haven't been saving
since I was potty-trained.

04:25.185 --> 04:27.719
But just out of curiosity,
what-what do you guys think?

04:27.787 --> 04:30.054
How... how much
you think is, uh, is enough?

04:30.123 --> 04:31.522
Well, it depends
on your plans.

04:31.591 --> 04:32.957
I mean,
maybe you want to travel,

04:33.026 --> 04:34.859
or, uh, do a vacation home.

04:34.928 --> 04:36.405
Either way, you're gonna need
a lot of money.

04:36.429 --> 04:39.464
Do you think...

04:39.532 --> 04:41.733
Do you think this is enough?

04:44.104 --> 04:46.971
Oh, dear. That bad?

04:47.040 --> 04:49.674
How have you saved
that much cash?

04:49.743 --> 04:51.342
Or perhaps that good?

04:51.411 --> 04:54.078
Wha-- I don't have anywhere
near that amount.

04:54.147 --> 04:57.181
Well, uh, while I wait
for Dr. Palmer's return,

04:57.250 --> 04:59.717
I think I'll go see Kasie.
(chuckles)

04:59.786 --> 05:03.187
Okay. Y-You got to tell me.
Where'd you get all that dough?

05:03.256 --> 05:04.633
Man, I was undercover
for a bunch of years.

05:04.657 --> 05:06.858
I never had to spend
my own money.

05:06.926 --> 05:09.527
So I just kept
stacking it up, baby.

05:09.596 --> 05:10.928
Oh.

05:10.997 --> 05:12.263
So you're saying I'm good?

05:12.332 --> 05:14.398
Yeah, you're good.

05:14.467 --> 05:16.033
Oh, yeah.

05:16.102 --> 05:18.236
The question is, am I?

05:18.304 --> 05:21.272
It was a by-the-book dive.
This shouldn't have happened.

05:21.341 --> 05:23.441
How well did you know
Petty Officer White?

05:23.510 --> 05:25.510
He'd only been
on board a few days.

05:25.578 --> 05:28.246
But I could already tell
he was a bit cocky.

05:28.314 --> 05:29.680
You know how SEALs are.

05:29.749 --> 05:31.549
Cocky enough to make
someone want to kill him?

05:31.584 --> 05:34.452
You NCIS guys
always go straight to that.

05:34.521 --> 05:36.220
Well, it's kind of our job.

05:36.289 --> 05:37.566
You just said
it shouldn't have happened.

05:37.590 --> 05:38.910
Except it did,
and we're not ready

05:38.958 --> 05:40.169
to rule anything out.
All I meant was,

05:40.193 --> 05:43.027
White was
a highly trained diver,

05:43.096 --> 05:44.762
so something must've gone wrong.

05:44.831 --> 05:46.597
Like maybe with the equipment.

05:46.666 --> 05:49.433
Okay. Aside from White,
who had access to his dive gear?

05:49.502 --> 05:50.535
His dive partner.

05:50.603 --> 05:54.138
And... me.

05:54.207 --> 05:57.208
So, you and White get along?

05:57.277 --> 05:59.277
You guys are barking up
the wrong tree, okay?

05:59.345 --> 06:00.745
I don't have any beef with...

06:00.814 --> 06:02.413
(loud alarm blares)

06:02.482 --> 06:04.549
What's that?
It's the dive alarm.

06:04.617 --> 06:07.118
MAN (over intercom):
Dive! Dive!

06:07.187 --> 06:09.587
Uh, what? They're not supposed
to dive with us on board.

06:09.656 --> 06:11.422
Not unless
it's an emergency, no.

06:11.491 --> 06:14.425
Oh. Mm. Okay. That's just great.

06:14.494 --> 06:16.539
MAN (over intercom):
Alert! Alert! Opening all vents.

06:16.563 --> 06:19.597
Well, whatever it is,
we're going down fast.

06:19.666 --> 06:21.599
Gibbs...

06:21.668 --> 06:23.000
- Bishop...
- Huh?

06:23.069 --> 06:24.335
- It's fine.
- Mm-Kay.

06:24.404 --> 06:26.270
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.309 --> 06:38.276
Chief of the Watch on the 1MC,
alert bays three and six

06:38.379 --> 06:39.619
to stand by for further orders.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.680
Aye, sir.

06:40.714 --> 06:42.614
Captain.

06:42.683 --> 06:45.183
I thought NCIS
left with the body.

06:45.252 --> 06:46.685
No. We're still here.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.365
Well, you two are gonna
have to sit tight, then.

06:48.389 --> 06:49.755
What's going on?

06:49.823 --> 06:51.201
We've been given
emergency dive orders,

06:51.225 --> 06:52.758
told to wait
for further instruction.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.092
We need to get word to NCIS.

06:54.161 --> 06:55.293
(chuckles)
That's a hard no.

06:55.362 --> 06:57.095
Orders include radio silence.

06:57.164 --> 06:57.724
Uh, but...

06:57.748 --> 06:59.532
Until we hear otherwise,
nothing is going out.

06:59.533 --> 07:01.711
BARKLEY: Well, don't worry. We'll
get you two off the <i>Memphis</i>

07:01.735 --> 07:03.702
and back in your cubicles
as soon as we can.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.504
We're not getting off.

07:07.207 --> 07:08.485
We have an investigation
to finish.

07:08.509 --> 07:09.853
The reason you haven't
finished it already?

07:09.877 --> 07:14.613
Captain, you have an unexplained
death on your boat.

07:14.681 --> 07:16.559
I'd like to think
you'd be a little more curious

07:16.583 --> 07:17.682
about what happened.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.653
You got a lot of stones
to stand on my bridge

07:21.722 --> 07:24.322
and insinuate I don't care
about what happens to my crew.

07:24.391 --> 07:25.557
BISHOP:
All due respect,

07:25.626 --> 07:27.170
a Navy SEAL died
on a routine training exercise

07:27.194 --> 07:29.861
and no one can explain why.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.830
We'll have full access
to your crew,

07:31.899 --> 07:34.399
and we'll start with Petty
Officer White's diving buddy.

07:34.468 --> 07:37.335
Agent Gibbs, I understand
that you have a job to do.

07:37.404 --> 07:39.704
We do. And the full authority
to do it.

07:40.108 --> 07:42.675
But let me make myself
perfectly clear.

07:42.744 --> 07:44.077
If either of you

07:44.146 --> 07:46.412
interfere with the
operations of this boat,

07:46.481 --> 07:48.848
I will fire you out
of that torpedo tube myself.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.984
(chuckles softly)

07:52.454 --> 07:54.354
I wish you luck with that.

07:59.427 --> 08:01.394
Sorry I'm so busy, Dr. Mallard.

08:01.463 --> 08:03.151
The timing on this
couldn't have been worse.

08:03.175 --> 08:03.764
Dr. Palmer...

08:03.765 --> 08:06.266
I know, I know I said
I'd stop apologizing.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.101
Well, then, stop.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.436
I-It's just that I had
a-a speech planned,

08:10.505 --> 08:12.906
and there was a-a slide show
in Kasie's lab--

08:12.974 --> 08:15.441
oh, and cookies.
Yeah, well,

08:15.510 --> 08:17.777
this three-page letter
and all these parting gifts,

08:17.846 --> 08:19.546
it's more than sufficient.

08:19.614 --> 08:23.049
And I'm leaving NCIS,
not the planet.

08:23.118 --> 08:24.996
Freaking out here, okay?
Tim, you're gonna be fine, man.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.219
Yeah, not compared to you.

08:26.288 --> 08:29.088
You got no kids and
a small fortune.

08:29.157 --> 08:30.590
I've got two kids
and a wife.

08:30.659 --> 08:32.419
I'm gonna be working
for the rest of my life.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.861
Well, the good news is,
you love your job, right?

08:34.929 --> 08:36.429
I've always loved mine.

08:36.498 --> 08:38.898
Well, no offense, Ducky,
but if I'm still working

08:38.967 --> 08:40.732
(laughs):
when I'm your age...

08:40.802 --> 08:41.868
Uh...

08:43.972 --> 08:45.516
McGEE: I'm not gonna finish
that sentence.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.540
Ducky, you look fantastic.

08:47.609 --> 08:49.375
Good move.
All right, well,

08:49.444 --> 08:51.077
since the rest of us
haven't retired yet,

08:51.146 --> 08:52.645
can we get back
to the dead guy?

08:52.714 --> 08:54.781
Now, that's your cue,
Dr. Palmer.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.316
I hear the, uh

08:56.384 --> 08:58.618
Cyber Division
barbershop quartet

08:58.687 --> 09:00.787
is bidding me a farewell
with a rendition

09:00.856 --> 09:03.389
of "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye."

09:05.160 --> 09:07.227
Damn, he loves Cole Porter,

09:07.295 --> 09:09.762
and I just saw
a box set on sale.

09:09.831 --> 09:12.065
Focus. Dead guy. Cause of death.

09:12.133 --> 09:15.235
Right. O-Our petty officer
drowned. No doubt about it.

09:15.303 --> 09:16.836
Aside from the water
in the lungs,

09:16.905 --> 09:19.239
there's also signs
of subcutaneous emphysema.

09:19.307 --> 09:23.476
That's what happens when the air
gets trapped in the tissue here.

09:23.545 --> 09:24.744
Any idea how that happened?

09:24.813 --> 09:26.779
That is
the million-dollar question.

09:26.848 --> 09:28.681
I have a buck 50 answer.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.817
You two.
Answer your phones much?

09:30.886 --> 09:32.606
Oh, I must have missed it.
Sorry about that.

09:32.654 --> 09:34.587
Gibbs always answers.

09:34.656 --> 09:36.643
If that technology hater
can manage to...

09:36.667 --> 09:37.825
What's up?

09:37.826 --> 09:39.359
One ring. Just saying.

09:39.427 --> 09:41.027
I was examining
the counterlung

09:41.096 --> 09:43.029
on Petty Officer White's
scuba gear.

09:43.098 --> 09:45.665
That's the oxygen tank,
for the aqua layperson.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.767
It was clearly tampered with.

09:47.836 --> 09:50.036
Any chance that the petty
officer might done it himself?

09:50.071 --> 09:51.704
Like, uh, accidentally?

09:51.773 --> 09:54.874
Not a chance. The diaphragm
on the gas-check valve--

09:54.943 --> 09:59.512
a buck 50 part, by the way--
was deliberately pulled out.

09:59.581 --> 10:00.980
Well, that makes this a...

10:01.049 --> 10:02.815
(English accent):
Murder, my dear Palmer.

10:06.955 --> 10:09.789
GIBBS: You looking for something,
Petty Officer Harper?

10:12.027 --> 10:14.327
White's drowning
had me spooked, so I decided

10:14.396 --> 10:16.796
to take a second look at the
entire SEAL team's equipment.

10:16.865 --> 10:18.831
Hmm. What did you find?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.544
Everyone's equipment
was in perfect working order.

10:20.568 --> 10:21.701
BISHOP:
No.

10:21.770 --> 10:23.503
Not everyone's.
I just tried our sat phone

10:23.571 --> 10:24.837
to see if I could get a signal.

10:24.906 --> 10:26.739
No, no. We're too deep.
Yeah.

10:26.808 --> 10:28.174
But Kasie sent a message,

10:28.243 --> 10:30.043
uh, just before
we lost contact.

10:30.111 --> 10:32.679
White's overpressure valve
was tampered with.

10:32.747 --> 10:34.881
- His death wasn't an accident.
HARPER: Tampered with?

10:34.950 --> 10:36.049
By who?

10:36.117 --> 10:37.350
You tell us.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.351
BISHOP:
Besides White,

10:38.420 --> 10:39.719
you and Master Diver Ross

10:39.788 --> 10:41.254
were the only one who had access

10:41.323 --> 10:42.900
to the equipment locker.
HARPER: Not true.

10:42.924 --> 10:44.490
Privacy's out the window
once we deploy.

10:44.559 --> 10:46.793
Almost anyone
could have gotten to our gear.

10:46.828 --> 10:48.895
Well, not everyone was cited
for disorderly conduct.

10:49.998 --> 10:51.397
GIBBS:
You had a fight with White

10:51.499 --> 10:52.899
about a week ago?
Yeah.

10:52.968 --> 10:54.912
And the week before that,
and the week before that.

10:54.936 --> 10:56.981
- You're not helping your case here.
- He's got a mouth.

10:57.005 --> 10:58.338
I'm a hothead.

10:58.406 --> 11:00.039
We fight and then make up
and move on.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.441
You've got brothers?

11:01.509 --> 11:03.576
It's like that.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.211
So, what was the fight about?

11:05.280 --> 11:06.590
MAN (over intercom):
All hands, report to stations

11:06.614 --> 11:07.947
for missile readiness test.

11:08.016 --> 11:09.082
(alert chiming)

11:09.150 --> 11:10.350
I got to go.

11:10.418 --> 11:13.886
Yeah. We'll walk with you.

11:15.857 --> 11:17.223
BISHOP: Petty
Officer Harper.

11:17.292 --> 11:19.092
You can tell us now, here,

11:19.160 --> 11:20.727
or in the brig.

11:22.831 --> 11:24.697
White thought
that Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man

11:24.766 --> 11:27.100
could beat up
Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man.

11:27.168 --> 11:28.301
And I didn't.

11:28.370 --> 11:30.203
(scoffs) Wow. Important stuff.

11:30.271 --> 11:31.738
It passes the time.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.773
You know,
White actually told me yesterday

11:33.842 --> 11:35.082
he wanted to show me something.

11:35.143 --> 11:36.809
I didn't think
nothing much of it,

11:36.878 --> 11:38.111
but now...
Yeah?

11:38.179 --> 11:39.612
What?
No clue.

11:39.681 --> 11:41.214
But he wanted to meet
in his quarters,

11:41.282 --> 11:43.049
so I'm guessing
it's got to still be there.

11:43.118 --> 11:45.918
MAN (over intercom):
All hands report to stations

11:45.987 --> 11:48.087
for missile readiness test.
I really got to go.

11:49.157 --> 11:51.257
They're both wrong.

11:51.326 --> 11:55.161
Tom Holland's Spider-Man wins,
hands down.

11:56.231 --> 11:57.930
"And no amount of gratitude

11:57.999 --> 12:00.633
could ever repay..." No.

12:00.702 --> 12:05.171
"...convey our appreciation

12:05.240 --> 12:07.440
"to Dr. Mallard

12:07.509 --> 12:11.010
"for his decades

12:11.079 --> 12:13.312
of service."

12:13.381 --> 12:16.182
So instead,
we are going to give him

12:16.251 --> 12:18.918
the lamest speech ever written.

12:18.987 --> 12:20.586
Well, that beats a gold watch.

12:21.689 --> 12:23.256
Agent Torres, Agent McGee.

12:23.324 --> 12:25.036
- How can I help you?
McGEE: Well, Director,

12:25.060 --> 12:26.460
we're not sure if
you heard about...

12:26.528 --> 12:28.127
Petty Officer White. I did.

12:28.196 --> 12:30.241
I presume you told Gibbs
he's got a murder on his hands.

12:30.265 --> 12:31.664
McGEE: Well, that's
why we're here.

12:31.733 --> 12:34.434
We tried calling him, but no
one's answering the sat phone.

12:34.502 --> 12:35.662
And you need my authorization

12:35.703 --> 12:37.023
to contact
the submarine directly.

12:37.072 --> 12:39.172
Sir, already tried that.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.874
Also not answering. We think
they may have already dove.

12:41.943 --> 12:43.476
No, that can't be.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.312
NCIS is required to be updated
on all dive orders

12:46.381 --> 12:48.181
while our agents
are on board. I...

12:48.249 --> 12:49.927
ASSISTANT (over intercom): Director?
- Yeah?

12:49.951 --> 12:51.050
The Pentagon is on at MTAC.

12:51.119 --> 12:52.318
They say it's urgent.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.623
Undersecretary Leo.

12:57.692 --> 12:59.158
How can I help you?

12:59.227 --> 13:01.205
I understand some of your agents
were investigating

13:01.229 --> 13:03.062
a death on the USS <i>Memphis.</i>

13:03.131 --> 13:06.199
Which has since been upgraded
to murder, but yes.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.086
Have you heard
from those agents recently?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.036
I'm told
we just lost contact, actually.

13:10.105 --> 13:11.571
What's going on?

13:11.573 --> 13:14.240
A total disaster, that's what.,

13:14.309 --> 13:17.043
Jennifer, where are my agents?

13:17.112 --> 13:19.645
I wish I could tell you that,
Leon.

13:19.714 --> 13:23.549
Five hours ago, the USS <i>Memphis</i>
dove to stealth depths

13:23.618 --> 13:26.352
and has been radio silent
ever since.

13:26.421 --> 13:27.920
Under whose orders?

13:27.989 --> 13:29.322
Not ours.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.060
I want to be clear here.

13:34.095 --> 13:36.262
Are you telling me
the United States government

13:36.331 --> 13:38.331
lost contact
with a nuclear submarine

13:38.399 --> 13:40.032
with two of my agents on board?

13:40.101 --> 13:42.768
Director, that is exactly
what I'm telling you.

13:53.369 --> 13:55.852
The USS <i>Memphis</i>
was last seen right here.

13:55.853 --> 13:57.853
The Navy's conducting a search
of the area,

13:57.921 --> 14:00.789
but that sub could be
almost anywhere by now.

14:00.858 --> 14:02.691
We have no idea who's
feeding them orders

14:02.760 --> 14:05.193
or what those orders are.
SLOANE: So, what can we do?

14:06.296 --> 14:07.596
McGEE:
Complete the investigation

14:07.664 --> 14:09.231
into Petty Officer White's
death.

14:09.299 --> 14:11.733
VANCE: Right. It's not lost
on anyone at DoD

14:11.802 --> 14:13.135
that White's murder coincided

14:13.203 --> 14:15.103
with the disappearance
!of the <i>Memphis.</i>

14:15.172 --> 14:16.850
You think both are connected?
Well, you need to operate

14:16.874 --> 14:18.140
on that assumption.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.242
Solving
Petty Officer White's murder

14:20.310 --> 14:23.812
could help determine what's
going on with the <i>Memphis.</i>

14:23.881 --> 14:25.158
- Right.
TORRES: I thought motor pool

14:25.182 --> 14:27.249
was gonna take you out
on a karaoke night.

14:27.317 --> 14:29.618
Until Jethro
and Eleanor are safe,

14:29.686 --> 14:31.586
Gloria Gaynor can wait.

14:31.655 --> 14:33.989
- I will survive.
VANCE: Okay, then.

14:34.057 --> 14:36.591
Agent McGee, I believe you are
the senior field agent. Please.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.593
Okay.

14:38.662 --> 14:40.228
Sloane, Ducky,
I need you

14:40.297 --> 14:42.764
to run profiles on
the entire crew of the <i>Memphis.</i>

14:42.833 --> 14:44.766
- On it. - On it.
- Torres, Petty Officer White.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.802
Bank statements,
cell records, credit cards.

14:46.870 --> 14:47.870
Got it.

14:48.739 --> 14:49.671
Bring it, McGee.

14:49.740 --> 14:50.772
I'm here to help.

14:50.841 --> 14:52.140
Director, you think you could

14:52.209 --> 14:53.675
twist some arms at the Pentagon

14:53.744 --> 14:55.443
and get Kasie the
telemetry on the <i>Memphis</i>

14:55.512 --> 14:56.945
before it went missing?

14:57.014 --> 14:58.980
Twisting arms is my specialty.

14:59.049 --> 15:00.415
I'm on it.

15:03.687 --> 15:06.087
BISHOP:
<i>Books, magazine,</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:07.923
toothbrush.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.525
I mean, if White was hiding
something here, it's gone.

15:10.594 --> 15:12.360
Keep looking.

15:12.429 --> 15:14.629
Whoa. Uh, Gibbs?

15:14.665 --> 15:16.298
What was that?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.432
Just an underwater current.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.201
I'm sure everything is fine.

15:19.269 --> 15:21.937
No, Gibbs,
everything is not fine.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.840
We-we are stuck below the water
for who knows how long

15:24.908 --> 15:27.642
on a ship that refuses to let us
speak to the surface.

15:27.711 --> 15:29.589
Bishop, I'm sure it's just
a routine mission, okay?

15:29.613 --> 15:31.847
Oh, my gosh. You do not
believe that for a second.

15:31.915 --> 15:35.717
Come on. The death, the
dive order, and now a murder?

15:35.786 --> 15:38.386
Don't tell me you don't think
something is up.

15:38.455 --> 15:40.121
You just don't want me to panic.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.289
How am I doing?

15:41.358 --> 15:43.291
Well, I'm starting to panic.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.563
What?
That book.

15:48.632 --> 15:50.472
Cover's all worn,
but the pages look brand-new.

15:52.903 --> 15:54.369
That's not <i>Moby-Dick.</i>

15:54.438 --> 15:56.371
It's an electrical
manual for the galley.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.174
What was White
doing with that?

15:59.243 --> 16:00.909
BOTH:
Not the question.

16:00.978 --> 16:03.011
Why was he hiding it?

16:18.762 --> 16:21.363
Well, still no word
from Gibbs or Bishop.

16:21.431 --> 16:22.697
Torres say you've
got something,

16:22.766 --> 16:24.277
and I hope it's more
than a tweaked neck.

16:24.301 --> 16:25.734
Yeah, Nick
tells no lies.

16:25.802 --> 16:28.870
Courtesy of some arm-twisting
by Director Vance,

16:28.939 --> 16:30.705
the Pentagon was kind enough
to give me

16:30.774 --> 16:32.674
all the telemetry info
they had on the <i>Memphis</i>

16:32.743 --> 16:33.743
since it left port.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.710
You found something?
Maybe.

16:35.779 --> 16:37.712
But it's kind of technical.

16:37.781 --> 16:38.781
See this?

16:38.849 --> 16:40.849
That's part of
an E.L.F. transmission,

16:40.918 --> 16:43.618
sent just after Gibbs and Bishop
boarded the sub.

16:43.687 --> 16:45.520
E.L.F. stands for...

16:45.589 --> 16:48.089
Extremely Low Frequency.
Right.

16:48.158 --> 16:49.718
Right. And to limit
transmission errors,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.927
it uses something called...

16:51.995 --> 16:54.796
Reed-Solomon error correction.
Which uses...

16:54.865 --> 16:57.365
Linear block-code to maximize
that correction.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.767
Oh, I like briefing just you.

16:58.835 --> 17:00.268
Yeah, but it looks like
that block

17:00.337 --> 17:02.270
is repeating itself
too many times.

17:02.339 --> 17:03.779
See, if you weren't
paying attention,

17:03.807 --> 17:05.640
you'd think it was
just noise in the sequence.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.876
But I think it's some kind
of coded message.

17:07.944 --> 17:08.877
What's it say?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.211
No idea.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.413
Who's it to?
Not exactly sure

17:11.481 --> 17:13.647
of that either,
but I think this section

17:13.717 --> 17:15.282
is a targeted IP address.

17:15.352 --> 17:17.319
And if I'm not just
seeing what I want to see,

17:17.387 --> 17:18.987
it belongs to...

17:21.892 --> 17:24.726
...a very non-military
storage facility

17:24.795 --> 17:26.394
in rural West Virginia.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.463
A military sub would not be
sending messages

17:28.531 --> 17:29.965
to a non-military site.

17:30.033 --> 17:32.233
Oh. So maybe I'm
barking up the wrong tree...

17:32.302 --> 17:33.302
You got an address?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.938
Thank you.

17:37.007 --> 17:40.809
Tell Willie-Dee
I said "What's up!?"

17:40.877 --> 17:42.477
I'm sorry, Agent Gibbs,
I can't allow you

17:42.546 --> 17:43.979
to break
radio silence.

17:44.047 --> 17:46.247
- We need to talk to our people.
- And you will.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.782
Just give any
message you have

17:47.851 --> 17:49.462
to Weapons Officer Hardy.
He'll make sure it gets sent

17:49.486 --> 17:50.964
the moment I give
the stand-down order.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.989
Moment's now.
You had a murder on your boat.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.324
Which means you now have
a killer on your boat, too.

17:56.393 --> 17:58.237
And we've ordered COB Shaw
to be at your disposal.

17:58.261 --> 18:00.729
That's not good enough.
I don't have time for this!

18:00.764 --> 18:03.431
This is a ship of war,
and we have our orders.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.266
New orders, in fact,
that just came in.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.469
And I need to go
carry them out.

18:09.272 --> 18:11.206
Don't take it personally.

18:11.274 --> 18:12.418
He does understand
that everyone on board

18:12.442 --> 18:13.708
is now a suspect, right?

18:13.777 --> 18:15.176
Of course he understands.

18:15.245 --> 18:17.145
He's not acting like it.

18:17.214 --> 18:19.347
He's just on edge with
the new orders. We all are.

18:19.416 --> 18:20.348
What are the new orders?

18:20.417 --> 18:22.484
That's classified.

18:22.552 --> 18:24.263
Navy regulations grant us access
in these circumstances, so...

18:24.287 --> 18:25.620
Well, actually,

18:25.689 --> 18:27.233
that was a matter
of some debate on the bridge.

18:27.257 --> 18:28.323
What are the orders?

18:29.960 --> 18:31.960
Unless you want to add

18:32.029 --> 18:33.561
obstruction of
justice charges

18:33.630 --> 18:34.896
to this investigation.

18:34.965 --> 18:38.500
The Pentagon told us to prep
all of our defenses.

18:38.568 --> 18:40.702
That's all I'm
willing to say.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.670
Now if you'll excuse me...

18:46.076 --> 18:47.008
Prep all of
our defenses?

18:47.077 --> 18:48.476
What does
that mean?

18:48.545 --> 18:52.347
It means this submarine
is preparing for war.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.550
With <i>who?</i>

19:04.634 --> 19:05.891
<i>(alert chimes)</i>

19:05.959 --> 19:08.262
MAN (over intercom): <i>Attention.</i>
<i>Alert one, alert one!</i>

19:08.263 --> 19:10.721
Man battle stations for
weapons systems readiness test.

19:10.722 --> 19:12.556
War? What in the hell
is going on up there

19:12.624 --> 19:14.269
that would involve a nuclear submarine?
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

19:14.293 --> 19:15.759
You know what?

19:15.828 --> 19:18.929
I-I'm not really a politico kind of guy.
(sighs)

19:18.997 --> 19:20.163
It could be anything.

19:20.232 --> 19:21.832
Yeah, or it could be nothing.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.034
Never stopped anybody before.
Gibbs,

19:24.102 --> 19:25.368
uh, something
about this just...

19:25.437 --> 19:26.837
Feels wrong.
All wrong.

19:26.905 --> 19:29.573
In a Rule 39
kind of way.

19:29.641 --> 19:31.374
"No such thing
as coincidence."

19:31.443 --> 19:32.043
(sighs)

19:32.067 --> 19:34.181
Yeah, it should probably
be higher up the list.

19:34.313 --> 19:36.446
This all started
after White's murder.

19:36.515 --> 19:38.882
The radio silence,
the new order.

19:38.951 --> 19:41.860
And was it me or did the
Captain seem just like...

19:41.884 --> 19:42.820
No.

19:42.821 --> 19:45.188
...a little too unconcerned
about a murder on his boat?

19:45.257 --> 19:48.191
No. No, it's not you.
Maybe he didn't believe us?

19:48.260 --> 19:50.438
Why didn't you tell him about
the book White was hiding?

19:50.462 --> 19:52.307
Maybe he would've taken us
a little bit more seriously.

19:52.331 --> 19:54.598
It's like you said,
everybody's a suspect.

19:56.368 --> 19:58.301
What's our next move?
Same as before.

19:58.370 --> 20:00.437
Petty Officer White.
Okay.

20:00.506 --> 20:03.473
If the murder was related
to the new order,

20:03.542 --> 20:05.575
then we need to
connect the dots.

20:05.644 --> 20:06.776
Where do we start?

20:06.845 --> 20:08.945
Are you hungry?

20:12.684 --> 20:14.818
TORRES:
<i>Kasie, wait, slow down.</i>

20:14.887 --> 20:16.152
Okay...

20:16.221 --> 20:18.755
Okay. Got it.

20:18.824 --> 20:20.056
I'll let him know.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.958
She find something?

20:22.027 --> 20:23.426
Still no word
from the sub.

20:23.495 --> 20:25.562
But she said she was able
to decode

20:25.631 --> 20:28.632
a little more of its, um...

20:28.700 --> 20:30.934
E.L.F. telemetry transmission?

20:31.003 --> 20:32.669
Yeah. That. And then she said

20:32.738 --> 20:35.805
she was able to pull
the sub-note part? Uh...

20:35.874 --> 20:37.107
The subnet <i>port?</i>

20:37.175 --> 20:38.820
See, that's why
you should have taken the call.

20:38.844 --> 20:40.443
Just skip to the end.

20:40.512 --> 20:43.280
TORRES: <i>Okay, the transmission</i>
<i>was sent to a router</i>

20:43.348 --> 20:45.916
in Unit 356
at the storage place.

20:45.984 --> 20:47.250
See? Was that so hard?

20:47.319 --> 20:49.252
You know,
when you look this good,

20:49.321 --> 20:50.954
yes, yes, it is.

20:53.025 --> 20:55.191
And McGee, I'm a little
distracted right now.

20:55.260 --> 20:56.793
I just hope they're okay.

20:56.862 --> 20:58.628
Bishop didn't really want
to go down

20:58.697 --> 21:00.297
to the sub in the first place.

21:00.365 --> 21:02.198
She's with Gibbs.
She'll be fine.

21:02.267 --> 21:04.467
Come on. You don't know that.

21:04.536 --> 21:07.504
Well, we can't think about it.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.840
We got to... got to focus
on the case, you know?

21:10.909 --> 21:12.509
But, hey,
think about that giant nest egg

21:12.578 --> 21:13.977
you got waiting for you.

21:14.046 --> 21:15.879
(laughing):
Come on, man.

21:15.948 --> 21:17.480
I was just messing with you.

21:17.549 --> 21:19.449
Sorry about that.

21:19.518 --> 21:21.952
It's fine.
Look, I chose a family.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.821
They're expensive. But
you, on the other hand,

21:24.890 --> 21:27.557
have the freedom to do whatever
you want with your money.

21:27.626 --> 21:30.126
Actually, not really, man.

21:32.864 --> 21:36.399
Maybe I want to spend it
on a family one day.

21:39.037 --> 21:41.504
Yo, heads up.

21:41.573 --> 21:43.807
What is that address
we're looking for again?

21:43.875 --> 21:47.143
Uh, it's the one with the
fire trucks in front of it?

21:48.280 --> 21:49.746
And a fire chief

21:49.815 --> 21:51.426
who looks a little too
much like Mr. Rogers.

21:51.450 --> 21:52.549
<i>Am I right?</i>

21:54.152 --> 21:56.152
Sorry, boys.

21:56.221 --> 21:57.921
Gonna have to ask
you to turn around.

21:57.990 --> 22:00.023
Got a fire in one of
those storage units.

22:00.092 --> 22:01.424
NCIS,

22:01.493 --> 22:03.193
Special Agents McGee and Torres.

22:03.261 --> 22:05.306
We actually need to get into
one of those storage units.

22:05.330 --> 22:07.297
Oh. Well,

22:07.332 --> 22:09.265
I hope it's not Unit 356.

22:10.669 --> 22:12.602
Looks like the fire

22:12.671 --> 22:14.070
was deliberate.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.407
Of course it was.

22:17.476 --> 22:19.676
BISHOP:
You recognize that book?

22:19.745 --> 22:21.511
MAN: Yeah, I know
what this is.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.046
It's the manual

22:23.115 --> 22:24.726
for the electrical
subsystems in our galley.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.683
We found this
in Petty Officer White's bunk.

22:26.752 --> 22:28.685
Any idea how it got there?

22:30.956 --> 22:32.889
Let's try this again.

22:32.958 --> 22:35.925
Is having this manual
part of White's duties?

22:35.994 --> 22:37.527
- No.
- Where is it normally kept?

22:37.596 --> 22:38.762
- Here.
- In your galley?

22:38.830 --> 22:39.974
You see where
we're going with this?

22:39.998 --> 22:41.731
Look, I don't know
anything, okay?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.466
And I got a lot
of mouths to feed.

22:43.535 --> 22:45.802
You do know that we're
investigating a murder, right?

22:45.871 --> 22:47.570
Which means
we're looking for a murderer.

22:47.639 --> 22:50.073
Well, wait a minute.
Not even a second.

22:51.376 --> 22:53.076
(sighs)
Okay, look,

22:53.145 --> 22:55.156
White came to me and asked
if he could have the manual

22:55.180 --> 22:56.546
for the electrical subsystems.

22:56.615 --> 22:58.415
So I gave it
to him, okay?

22:58.483 --> 22:59.927
- He's a diver, not an electrician.
- You didn't think

22:59.951 --> 23:02.285
the request was strange?
It was strange as hell!

23:02.354 --> 23:04.220
I have no idea why he wanted it.

23:04.289 --> 23:06.134
But I'm just the cook. Wasn't
my place to ask questions.

23:06.158 --> 23:08.625
So, why couldn't you just
have told us that before?

23:08.694 --> 23:11.728
I was ordered not to.
By who?

23:13.665 --> 23:16.433
After White took the manual,
I reported it to the COB.

23:16.501 --> 23:18.301
She told me not to tell anyone.

23:18.370 --> 23:21.237
When was this?
Day before White was killed.

23:21.306 --> 23:24.174
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to get back to work.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.784
Well, I think it's time we
talk to the chief of the boat.

23:37.689 --> 23:40.323
Jack.
Mm.

23:40.392 --> 23:42.112
How are the, uh,
crew profiles coming along?

23:42.160 --> 23:43.927
Mm, almost done.

23:43.995 --> 23:46.930
But Ducky and I weren't able
to find anything amiss.

23:46.998 --> 23:49.532
The Navy doesn't
let just anyone serve

23:49.601 --> 23:51.601
on a nuclear sub.
They have

23:51.670 --> 23:55.171
the most stringent vetting
process on the entire planet.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.706
And we're grateful for that.

23:56.775 --> 23:58.775
- Mm.
- I got something else here for you.

24:00.178 --> 24:02.879
Walter Miller.
Who is he?

24:02.948 --> 24:04.481
He's the owner
of the storage unit

24:04.583 --> 24:06.783
that burnt to the ground.
He was a genius

24:06.852 --> 24:08.485
computer science professor.

24:08.553 --> 24:10.386
Two years ago,
he cancelled his credit cards,

24:10.455 --> 24:12.655
sold his home, and
he went full hermit.

24:12.724 --> 24:15.391
Used to go to work in a suit,
and now

24:15.460 --> 24:16.826
he's living off the grid and

24:16.895 --> 24:19.796
receiving coded messages
from a nuclear sub.

24:19.865 --> 24:21.242
Mm-hmm, and I heard you
recovered a hard drive,

24:21.266 --> 24:22.665
too, right?
What's left of it.

24:22.734 --> 24:24.467
Kasie's working on it.

24:24.536 --> 24:27.170
Wait. What is this?
It's from Miller's blog.

24:27.239 --> 24:28.538
Homeland just
sent it over.

24:28.607 --> 24:30.473
Wow.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.642
Yikes.

24:33.745 --> 24:36.045
Yowzer. Listen to this.

24:36.114 --> 24:37.725
"The United States has
been far too lenient

24:37.749 --> 24:39.249
"since the end
of the Cold War.

24:39.317 --> 24:42.352
"We need to launch
a preemptive war against

24:42.420 --> 24:44.354
our enemies
before it's too late"?

24:44.422 --> 24:47.157
So, yeah, I-I'd say...
Yowzer.

24:47.225 --> 24:51.094
This guy should not be talking
to anyone on a nuclear sub.

24:51.163 --> 24:53.830
We need to find him, like, now.

24:57.302 --> 24:59.669
Agent Gibbs. Excuse me.
I'm expected on the bridge.

24:59.738 --> 25:00.670
It can wait.

25:00.739 --> 25:03.006
Not a good time.
No.

25:03.074 --> 25:05.108
No, it's not.

25:06.178 --> 25:08.578
This way.

25:08.647 --> 25:10.880
MAN (over intercom):
Alert one. Alert one.

25:10.949 --> 25:13.783
Rig for silent running.
Hey. Out.

25:13.852 --> 25:15.618
(alert chiming)

25:19.691 --> 25:21.591
Where'd you find that?

25:21.660 --> 25:23.259
In a dead man's chest.
Next question.

25:23.328 --> 25:24.939
Why'd you order your cook
to keep quiet about it?

25:24.963 --> 25:26.629
It's a personal matter.

25:26.698 --> 25:28.009
Your CO said we would have
your full cooperation.

25:28.033 --> 25:30.400
Why was White asking
about this book?

25:30.468 --> 25:33.703
I'm the one who told him
to get it, okay?

25:33.772 --> 25:35.183
- Why?
MAN (over intercom): Alert one.

25:35.207 --> 25:36.973
Alert one.
Man battle stations.

25:37.042 --> 25:38.786
Ready torpedoes.
- This really isn't a good time.

25:38.810 --> 25:39.943
Then stop wasting it.

25:40.011 --> 25:42.745
Two days ago, I walked in on

25:42.814 --> 25:45.648
Weapons Officer Hardy in
the kitchen, fiddling with

25:45.717 --> 25:48.551
an electrical sub-panel. He said
he was doing a routine check.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.364
Torpedo guys don't fiddle
with electrical sub-panels.

25:50.388 --> 25:52.121
Not normally,

25:52.190 --> 25:55.124
no. So I wanted to know
what was behind that panel.

25:55.193 --> 25:57.433
But I didn't want to draw
too much attention to it, so...

25:57.495 --> 25:58.840
So you asked White
to get the book for you.

25:58.864 --> 26:00.263
A day later, he's dead.

26:00.332 --> 26:02.343
You didn't think that
we should know about all this?

26:02.367 --> 26:03.766
Quite frankly, no.

26:03.835 --> 26:05.768
I've known you for 15 minutes.

26:05.837 --> 26:08.304
I've known Justin Hardy
for 15 years.

26:08.373 --> 26:10.673
He's got nothing to do with
Petty Officer White's death.

26:10.742 --> 26:12.653
- That's not your call.
- We need to speak to your captain.

26:12.677 --> 26:14.944
No, you don't! I don't know
what happened to White,

26:15.013 --> 26:17.981
but whatever it was,
Hardy's not involved.

26:18.049 --> 26:19.749
I've gone to war
with him.

26:19.818 --> 26:21.138
I was there when
his entire family

26:21.186 --> 26:22.652
was killed in
a car crash.

26:22.721 --> 26:24.532
We have been to hell and back,
and I've never once questioned

26:24.556 --> 26:27.290
his dedication to the uniform.

26:27.359 --> 26:30.193
Now, if you'll excuse me, this
boat is about to go into battle,

26:30.262 --> 26:31.961
I'm needed on the bridge,

26:32.030 --> 26:34.797
and we simply cannot afford
your distractions! Orlando?

26:36.534 --> 26:39.435
These two are to be confined
until further notice.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.508

<i>Have you made any headway</i>

26:45.577 --> 26:46.876
finding this Walter Miller?

26:46.945 --> 26:49.012
We have teams out
looking for him as we speak.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.359
I've been reading an old blog
post where he talks extensively

26:51.383 --> 26:52.849
about the hills of
northern Virginia.

26:52.918 --> 26:54.517
My hunch is he's there.

26:54.586 --> 26:56.530
I don't need to tell you
that time is of the essence.

26:56.554 --> 26:58.021
Have there been any
new developments?

26:58.089 --> 26:59.889
About 20 minutes ago,

26:59.958 --> 27:02.558
the USS <i>Memphis</i> pinged one
of our deep sea microphones.

27:02.627 --> 27:04.127
Fantastic.
It's a nightmare.

27:04.195 --> 27:06.195
The <i>Memphis</i> was headed
in the direction

27:06.264 --> 27:08.498
of the Russian fleet
in the North Sea.

27:08.566 --> 27:10.366
That's great.

27:10.435 --> 27:13.169
And she's still ignoring orders
to surface.

27:13.238 --> 27:15.171
We think we know why.
She's not getting them!

27:15.240 --> 27:16.806
VANCE:
Undersecretary Leo,

27:16.875 --> 27:18.908
this is Kasie Hines,
our forensic scientist.

27:18.977 --> 27:20.510
Can you explain that?

27:20.578 --> 27:22.412
Uh, I was able to
partially reconstruct

27:22.480 --> 27:24.580
a burned hard drive that
belonged to Walter Miller.

27:24.649 --> 27:26.349
We found the
blueprints for a device

27:26.418 --> 27:28.017
we believe was
designed to block

27:28.086 --> 27:29.430
the Navy's transmissions.
And allow Miller

27:29.454 --> 27:31.821
to feed the <i>Memphis</i>
his own orders.

27:31.890 --> 27:35.191
And he was somehow able to
install this device on our sub?

27:35.260 --> 27:36.526
Yes, that's our working theory.

27:36.594 --> 27:37.860
That's almost impossible.

27:37.929 --> 27:39.729
He doesn't have
that kind of access.

27:39.798 --> 27:42.332
Unless he had help.
Can you bypass this device?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.900
No. Our only chance is

27:43.969 --> 27:46.436
to find Miller's
transmitter and shut it down.

27:46.504 --> 27:50.039
Director Vance, my people will
continue to do everything we can

27:50.108 --> 27:52.108
to make contact
with the USS <i>Memphis,</i>

27:52.177 --> 27:54.677
but you need
to find Walter Miller

27:54.746 --> 27:56.446
before that boat gets
within firing range

27:56.514 --> 27:57.914
of the Russian fleet.

27:57.983 --> 27:59.849
They have done nothing
to provoke us

27:59.918 --> 28:03.086
and won't take kindly
to a provocation on our side.

28:03.154 --> 28:04.887
We'll find him.
LEO: And may God help you.

28:04.956 --> 28:06.889
Because if you don't,

28:06.958 --> 28:10.727
we will have no choice
but to sink the USS <i>Memphis.</i>

28:26.820 --> 28:27.931
<i>(banging on door)</i>

28:28.000 --> 28:29.104
Let us out!

28:29.105 --> 28:30.345
- He's not gonna open it.
- Ugh!

28:30.373 --> 28:32.306
- He's got his orders.
- (groans)

28:32.375 --> 28:34.008
It's locked up
pretty tight.

28:34.043 --> 28:36.310
Hey, any way to open
this from the inside?

28:36.379 --> 28:37.979
Yeah. Blowtorch.

28:38.047 --> 28:40.214
Yeah, well, I should've
brought mine from home.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.983
What are you looking for?

28:42.051 --> 28:43.117
A blowtorch.

28:43.186 --> 28:44.685
(scoffs)

28:44.754 --> 28:48.322
So, Gibbs,
the COB said that we were

28:48.391 --> 28:50.691
getting ready to go
to battle?

28:50.760 --> 28:52.827
Yeah. Yeah, I heard that.

28:52.896 --> 28:55.062
Yeah. Okay, so with who?

28:55.131 --> 28:56.998
Well, Bishop, you're the
analyst. You tell me.

28:57.066 --> 28:59.066
It's got to be the Russians,
right? I mean,

28:59.135 --> 29:00.513
they're the ones
who have been trying

29:00.537 --> 29:02.069
to destabilize us for years, but

29:02.138 --> 29:04.739
for it to spill
into open hostilities? I-I...

29:04.808 --> 29:07.542
I don't believe it could get
this bad this quickly.

29:08.611 --> 29:10.545
Maybe it hasn't.

29:10.613 --> 29:12.814
You think

29:12.882 --> 29:14.715
the attack orders are fake?

29:14.784 --> 29:17.151
I think the guy who
fires the torpedoes

29:17.220 --> 29:19.921
is now a murder suspect.

29:19.989 --> 29:23.424
So, we need the captain
to verify his orders.

29:23.493 --> 29:25.660
What's this for?

29:25.728 --> 29:27.595
You are right.

29:27.664 --> 29:29.831
We are locked up tight.

29:31.835 --> 29:33.835
But the air isn't.

29:36.806 --> 29:39.440
McGEE:
<i>Okay, we need to cover</i>

29:39.509 --> 29:41.275
all of Northern Virginia fast.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.678
Go in teams of two,
spiral search pattern.

29:43.746 --> 29:45.847
Gas stations, supply stores.

29:45.915 --> 29:48.082
Someone must have
seen this guy.

29:48.151 --> 29:50.351
State police are
setting up checkpoints.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.353
I got BOLOs out across
the entire state.

29:52.422 --> 29:55.289
I hope we're not wrong. What if
Miller isn't in Virginia at all?

29:55.358 --> 29:57.024
Oh, he is.
How do you know?

29:57.093 --> 29:59.360
It's what I do.
We got to start somewhere.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.062
We can't search
the entire country.

30:01.130 --> 30:04.298
We might not have to.
Tell them what you told me.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.968
Yes, we were going
over an old cold case

30:07.036 --> 30:11.239
where the culprit is a hermit,
not unlike Walter Miller.

30:11.307 --> 30:14.242
(stammers) Even though the
defining trait of a hermit is a,

30:14.310 --> 30:16.244
a desire for solitude...
They usually

30:16.312 --> 30:18.212
stay in contact with
at least one person.

30:18.281 --> 30:19.614
Sorry, Ducky.

30:19.682 --> 30:20.781
So we dug deeper

30:20.850 --> 30:22.583
into Miller's background
and found out

30:22.652 --> 30:25.086
that he has an aunt that
he used to live with as a kid!

30:25.154 --> 30:26.487
SLOANE: Oh, right.
Aunt Jessie.

30:26.556 --> 30:29.056
Who lives in a retirement home

30:29.125 --> 30:30.758
at a V.A. in Maryland.

30:30.827 --> 30:32.838
KASIE: And take a look
at Aunt Jessie's phone records.

30:32.862 --> 30:34.262
See there?

30:34.330 --> 30:36.264
The first of every month,
she gets a call.

30:36.332 --> 30:38.666
From a camping supply store

30:38.735 --> 30:40.902
pay phone.
(chuckles)

30:40.970 --> 30:42.370
Who uses a pay
phone anymore?

30:42.438 --> 30:44.105
A hermit without a cell phone

30:44.173 --> 30:45.973
in the hills
of northern Virginia.

30:46.042 --> 30:47.675
Nice.

30:47.744 --> 30:49.610
MAN (over intercom):
Alert one. Alert one.

30:49.679 --> 30:52.914
Final systems check.
Prepare for incoming.

30:52.982 --> 30:55.616
(alert chiming)

31:02.558 --> 31:05.026
(groaning)

31:06.996 --> 31:09.597
Yeah. I'm kind of sorry
about that.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.500
(coughing)

31:12.568 --> 31:14.135
The bridge is that way.

31:14.203 --> 31:15.269
Let's go.

31:17.941 --> 31:19.184
McGEE:
<i>All right, the store owner</i>

31:19.208 --> 31:20.875
<i>was able to identify Miller.</i>

31:20.944 --> 31:22.710
He drew us a map to the cabin.

31:22.779 --> 31:24.512
Just go to the end
of the road here.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.380
All right, let Vance
know we're close.

31:27.650 --> 31:29.183
That's got to be
Miller's cabin.

31:29.252 --> 31:32.653
You know, something about
this place feels familiar.

31:32.722 --> 31:34.566
Hey, you think that Gibbs
would ever end up like a--

31:34.590 --> 31:36.357
like a crazy hermit?

31:36.426 --> 31:39.961
No. Gibbs wouldn't have
all these radio towers.

31:40.029 --> 31:41.729
I don't know, man.

31:41.798 --> 31:44.065
I think he would.

31:47.637 --> 31:50.371
REPORTER: Pentagon officials
are refusing to comment

31:50.440 --> 31:52.518
on the rumors that a nuclear
submarine has gone missing,

31:52.542 --> 31:54.375
though our sources
are telling us otherwise.

31:54.444 --> 31:56.010
(clatters)

31:56.079 --> 31:58.039
In truth, the geopolitical...
(radio switches off)

31:59.615 --> 32:01.649
Don't even think about it.
NCIS.

32:01.718 --> 32:03.351
Hands in the air.

32:07.090 --> 32:09.924
Turn around. Turn around!

32:11.160 --> 32:13.060
Looks like he's bouncing
his signal

32:13.129 --> 32:14.195
off one of our satellites.

32:14.263 --> 32:16.197
(grunts)

32:17.567 --> 32:18.599
You're too late.

32:18.668 --> 32:20.167
And you're a weird,
creepy hermit.

32:20.236 --> 32:22.703
In my hand are
a set of orders

32:22.772 --> 32:25.539
to fire upon the
Russian fleet,

32:25.608 --> 32:28.042
who are, at this moment,
preparing to launch

32:28.111 --> 32:32.046
a preemptive strike against
multiple targets in the U.S.

32:32.115 --> 32:36.083
We'll be within range
in the next four minutes.

32:36.152 --> 32:38.386
XO, please confirm.

32:40.656 --> 32:43.024
I confirm.

32:43.092 --> 32:45.526
May God help us all.

32:45.595 --> 32:47.028
Chief of the Watch,

32:47.096 --> 32:48.963
flood tubes one and two.
Aye, sir.

32:49.032 --> 32:50.064
Weapons Conn...

32:51.300 --> 32:52.800
...fire on my order.

32:52.869 --> 32:53.934
Aye, sir.

32:54.003 --> 32:56.537
Captain, we need
to talk.

32:56.606 --> 32:58.439
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:58.508 --> 33:00.108
We are in the middle
of a torpedo launch.

33:00.143 --> 33:02.421
And we have reason to believe
those launch orders may be invalid.

33:02.445 --> 33:04.645
They've been authenticated.
Now get off my bridge.

33:04.714 --> 33:07.114
- - We're not going anywhere.
Then I'll have you thrown off.

33:07.183 --> 33:08.115
Try.

33:08.184 --> 33:09.184
TORRES:
<i>McGee,</i>

33:09.218 --> 33:10.218
what are you waiting for?

33:10.286 --> 33:11.752
Send the stand-down order.

33:11.821 --> 33:13.621
I'm-I'm not sure how.

33:13.689 --> 33:16.090
Uh, the orders have to be
properly formatted

33:16.159 --> 33:17.992
or the system won't take 'em,
okay?

33:18.061 --> 33:21.062
I-I don't remember whether
the hash goes before the bang

33:21.130 --> 33:22.971
or even how many splats
to use.

33:22.972 --> 33:24.932
- Tim, you have to figure this out.
- (sighs)

33:25.001 --> 33:27.134
I've never done anything
like this before, okay?

33:27.203 --> 33:30.304
It's not like
I can just call in a lifeline.

33:31.407 --> 33:33.307
I said off my bridge.

33:33.376 --> 33:34.975
Are you gonna tell him?

33:36.179 --> 33:37.978
Or am I?

33:39.816 --> 33:40.816
Tell me what?

33:42.418 --> 33:43.651
Straussy, hey, it's Tim.

33:43.719 --> 33:45.252
Listen, are you still working

33:45.321 --> 33:47.855
on that hyperrealistic
sub simulation game?

33:47.924 --> 33:49.623
BISHOP:
<i>Your weapons officer</i>

33:49.692 --> 33:51.358
needs to be
relieved from duty.

33:51.427 --> 33:52.993
Excuse me?
And your orders

33:53.062 --> 33:54.829
reauthenticated
by somebody else.

33:54.897 --> 33:57.198
He's a suspect
in our murder investigation.

33:57.266 --> 33:58.599
This is ridiculous.

33:58.668 --> 34:00.179
Chief of the Boat,
escort these two off the bridge.

34:00.203 --> 34:01.135
XO, belay that order.

34:01.204 --> 34:03.003
Conn-sonar,
90 seconds from target.

34:03.072 --> 34:04.516
Agent Gibbs, do you have proof
my weapons officer

34:04.540 --> 34:05.806
was involved in White's murder?

34:05.875 --> 34:07.174
You need to verify
your orders.

34:07.243 --> 34:08.509
And give away our position?

34:08.578 --> 34:09.755
Millions of lives are at stake.

34:09.779 --> 34:11.245
I know what's at stake.

34:11.346 --> 34:12.679
Do you have proof?

34:16.585 --> 34:18.083
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

34:18.152 --> 34:19.264
- No, sir.
- Then get these two

34:19.288 --> 34:21.521
the hell off my bridge
and lock them in the brig.

34:22.690 --> 34:23.956
Federal agents.

34:24.025 --> 34:26.025
Drop the weapon! Drop it!
You're under arrest.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.505
SHAW: Agent Gibbs...
Step away from the station, now.

34:27.529 --> 34:29.362
Drop your weapon!

LEO:
<i>The USS</i> Memphis

We can't wait.

34:34.603 --> 34:36.536
Ma'am,

34:36.605 --> 34:39.606

You did something to this boat,

34:58.060 --> 34:59.537
you killed White.
if you do not drop that weapon!

36:25.414 --> 36:26.924
I guess World War III
is gonna have to wait.

36:26.948 --> 36:29.983
Listen to me. We have to launch.

36:30.052 --> 36:31.584
We have to launch.

36:31.653 --> 36:33.920
TORRES:
Blah, blah, blah, creepy hermit.

36:33.989 --> 36:35.855
Straussy, hey.

36:35.924 --> 36:38.158
Thanks for the info, man.

36:38.226 --> 36:40.060
Yep, writing a book about a sub.

36:40.128 --> 36:41.561
How'd you guess?

36:42.931 --> 36:44.108
TORRES:
<i>So what was that weapons guy</i>

36:44.132 --> 36:46.032
doing in the kitchen?

36:46.101 --> 36:49.869
Well, he was installing a device
in an electrical conduit

36:49.938 --> 36:53.506
that fed into the
antenna room next door.

36:53.575 --> 36:55.542
And that's what blocked
the Navy's signals?

36:55.577 --> 36:58.511
Yep, and only allowed Miller's
transmissions to go through.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.946
What about Petty Officer White?

37:00.015 --> 37:01.915
Once he asked
for that kitchen manual,

37:01.983 --> 37:03.350
there was only a matter of time

37:03.418 --> 37:05.552
before the device was
discovered, so...

37:05.620 --> 37:06.786
Bye-bye, Petty Officer White.

37:06.855 --> 37:07.787
Mm.

37:07.856 --> 37:09.389
Agent Bishop.

37:10.492 --> 37:12.359
I'm glad to have you back.

37:12.427 --> 37:15.395
Not as glad as I am to be back.

37:15.464 --> 37:19.099
You know, for a second, we
thought we almost lost you guys.

37:21.303 --> 37:22.802
Okay, so, uh, we're...
(clears throat)

37:22.871 --> 37:24.204
...we're gonna be late.

37:24.272 --> 37:26.439
Oh, that's right.

37:26.508 --> 37:29.042
What? Late? Late for what?

37:29.111 --> 37:31.111
What? Hello?

37:31.179 --> 37:33.146
You guys...

37:33.215 --> 37:35.315
It's fascinating.

37:35.384 --> 37:39.719
The psychology of these two men
could not be more different.

37:39.788 --> 37:41.366
SLOANE: Yet they landed
in the same place.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.323
DUCKY:
World peace through world war.

37:43.392 --> 37:45.158
Well, they're certainly
not the only ones

37:45.227 --> 37:47.260
to follow the rabbit
down the hole.

37:47.329 --> 37:49.996
My guess is, after
Hardy's family was killed,

37:50.065 --> 37:52.165
he came unglued looking
for meaning in his life

37:52.234 --> 37:54.667
and started talking
to the wrong people.

37:54.736 --> 37:57.137
He met Miller in a chat room
two years ago.

37:57.205 --> 38:00.774
You know, the Internet will be
the death of us all.

38:00.842 --> 38:02.954
I can't imagine you're going to
struggle for the meaning of life

38:02.978 --> 38:05.044
post-retirement.
Hardly.

38:05.113 --> 38:08.848
I have so many projects planned,
I don't know where to start.

38:08.917 --> 38:12.018
Well, I think you're doing
just fine so far.

38:12.087 --> 38:13.486
- Director.
- In fact, the chairman

38:13.555 --> 38:16.122
of the joint chiefs wanted me
to thank you personally

38:16.191 --> 38:17.690
for saving our butts.

38:17.759 --> 38:19.225
Well, it was
a team effort.

38:19.294 --> 38:20.872
But we couldn't have done it
without you.

38:20.896 --> 38:22.829
And you're an invaluable
member of that team.

38:25.534 --> 38:29.202
Why do I get the feeling
I'm being set up?

38:29.271 --> 38:32.772
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Doctor.

38:32.841 --> 38:35.542
But we should keep walking.
This way.

38:37.179 --> 38:39.312
DUCKY:
If this is a surprise party,

38:39.381 --> 38:41.648
you know I would rather
shave my eyeballs.

38:41.716 --> 38:44.117
Dr. Mallard, you're a living,
breathing encyclopedia

38:44.186 --> 38:45.985
of the entire history of NCIS.

38:46.054 --> 38:47.865
GIBBS: This place is what
it is because of you, Duck.

38:47.889 --> 38:49.889
And this case showed us
just how valuable

38:49.958 --> 38:51.691
your wealth of knowledge can be.

38:51.760 --> 38:55.128
I-I appreciate the compliments,
gentlemen, but I need a change.

38:55.197 --> 38:56.729
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, and so do we.

38:56.798 --> 38:57.831
Excuse me.

38:57.899 --> 38:59.799
This way, please.

39:01.937 --> 39:05.672
Dr. Mallard, I, um,
assume that you are aware

39:05.740 --> 39:09.676
that FBI and CIA have
agency historians,

39:09.744 --> 39:11.889
whose purpose is to insure
that the collective knowledge

39:11.913 --> 39:15.048
of those institutions live on
for future generations.

39:15.116 --> 39:16.716
Yeah, of course.

39:16.785 --> 39:19.185
(chuckles): But, uh,
what has that to do with me?

39:25.961 --> 39:29.729
"Donald Mallard,
MD, NCIS...

39:31.433 --> 39:32.832
...Historian"?

39:32.901 --> 39:35.735
Now, if you need
some time to think...

39:35.804 --> 39:37.670
Can I come and go as I please?

39:37.739 --> 39:38.872
Why, yes.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.541
Does it come
with a badge and gun?

39:41.610 --> 39:42.542
No.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.177
No.
(chuckles)

39:44.246 --> 39:46.079
So it's, uh,

39:46.147 --> 39:48.748
paid, part-time work.

39:48.817 --> 39:50.550
Well, now,

39:50.619 --> 39:55.088
I suppose this is not the time
to discuss contractual details.

39:55.156 --> 39:56.222
Mm, is that a yes?

39:56.291 --> 39:58.024
It sounded like a yes.

39:58.093 --> 40:00.393
Well...

40:02.030 --> 40:03.630
...if you insist.

40:03.698 --> 40:04.942
- That was a yes.
JIMMY: That's a yes.

40:04.966 --> 40:06.566
(laughter, applause)
All right.

40:17.312 --> 40:19.045
VANCE:
Um...

40:19.147 --> 40:21.581
your office still needs work.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.283
(chuckles)

40:23.351 --> 40:25.985
Yes, it does.

40:26.054 --> 40:29.422
(soft laughter)

40:32.661 --> 40:34.327
(chuckles)
