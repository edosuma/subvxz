01:19.306 --> 01:20.975
[thunder rumbling]

01:24.166 --> 01:27.253
It was an honest mistake.
She was trying to help.

01:27.336 --> 01:29.213
A little more help and I'll be dead.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.385
She hates wearing her glasses.
Says it makes her nose look big.

01:33.815 --> 01:38.069
You want to assassinate someone,
vision is a basic requirement.

01:38.148 --> 01:42.669
It's like step one, pick a person
to kill. Step two, kill that person.

01:42.753 --> 01:45.046
She won't last a month in the SHU.

01:45.131 --> 01:47.508
This is a royal fuck-up, girls.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.426
Vee is going to know
that she is the target.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.345
The whole family is in danger.

01:51.428 --> 01:56.308
Unless... we use it to our advantage.

01:56.392 --> 01:58.352
She doesn't know it was a mistake.

01:58.435 --> 02:03.357
We tell her it's a warning
shot. Don't fuck with Red.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.486
Or a 79-year-old woman will
shank someone you never met.

02:07.569 --> 02:09.405
[Frieda] That's how scary you are.

02:09.488 --> 02:13.825
Stab a stranger in the
kidney just to send a message.

02:13.909 --> 02:18.664
If I was this Vee person, I'd
think twice about pissing you off.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.582
It's what Taslitz would want.

02:20.666 --> 02:24.670
Taslitz got us into this situation.
We're not doubling down on that nonsense.

02:28.424 --> 02:32.052
We need to explain what
happened... peacefully.

02:32.135 --> 02:33.345
A parley.

02:33.429 --> 02:36.348
Parley? What are we, pirates?

02:36.432 --> 02:38.892
Well, one of us does
have an octopus tattoo.

02:40.644 --> 02:43.063
[Sophia] Taping windows is not a good idea.

02:43.146 --> 02:45.191
[Bell] It's in the emergency manual.

02:45.274 --> 02:46.983
[Ford] Bad news, Hurricane Wanda.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.570
You've been downgraded to a tropical storm.

02:49.653 --> 02:50.862
Hilarious.

02:50.946 --> 02:53.407
The weatherman said you're
getting wider, though.

02:53.490 --> 02:55.909
You could flatten a few
trees when your ass hits land.

02:55.992 --> 02:57.828
Okay, Steve Harvey, we get it.

02:57.911 --> 03:02.249
Last time we had leaks in room four
and in intake and in the pharmacy.

03:03.459 --> 03:05.336
[sighs] They did some
patchwork over the summer,

03:05.419 --> 03:09.005
but I am not optimistic about
what's happening up there.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.257
This place needs a new roof.

03:10.341 --> 03:13.051
Yeah, Fig is all over that. Don't worry.

03:13.134 --> 03:17.306
She's also getting us an
espresso bar and a swimming pool.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.113
[sighs]

03:33.196 --> 03:34.865
[vacuum whirring]

03:44.833 --> 03:46.377
[whirring stops]

03:47.878 --> 03:49.380
So much for learning your lesson, huh?

03:50.797 --> 03:51.798
What lesson is that?

03:51.882 --> 03:53.884
I don't know, associating
with the criminal element.

03:53.967 --> 03:57.429
Girl, I am the criminal element,
and so are you, last time I checked.

03:57.513 --> 03:58.722
You know what I mean.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.973
Man, don't start this again.

04:00.056 --> 04:01.725
Yo, she got you thrown in the SHU.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.101
That wasn't her.

04:03.184 --> 04:05.687
That was this place coming down
on me like it's done before,

04:05.771 --> 04:07.147
and it'll do it again.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.440
[scoffs]

04:09.566 --> 04:11.735
Something's gonna fuck you, you know?

04:12.903 --> 04:15.656
The system, the man, Vee.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.284
Can't do nothin' about it.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.827
At least Vee gives you back 10%.

04:21.911 --> 04:23.539
She took my friend.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.957
And you gonna fight her forever?

04:26.875 --> 04:30.086
Stop making things so hard for yourself.

04:32.548 --> 04:34.215
[whirring resumes]

04:35.926 --> 04:38.053
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

04:39.220 --> 04:40.221
You all right, Chapman?

04:42.015 --> 04:44.351
Yeah. Yeah.

04:44.435 --> 04:45.811
Get to talk to your lawyer?

04:46.728 --> 04:49.898
I talked to one of his partners.
He said that there's, um...

04:49.981 --> 04:51.817
he said that there's
nothing that they can do.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.153
He said prisoners get
transferred all the time.

04:55.236 --> 04:58.239
Yeah, we got, like, 30 girls
up from Pensacola last year

04:58.324 --> 05:00.742
when they had that tuberculosis scare.

05:00.826 --> 05:01.868
This isn't that.

05:01.952 --> 05:05.539
This is Fig fucking me personally.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.375
She's hated me ever since
that stupid radio show.

05:08.459 --> 05:09.668
Mmm.

05:09.751 --> 05:11.670
But you, you got connections.

05:11.753 --> 05:14.381
Now, you can fight this. You got furlough.

05:14.465 --> 05:16.550
I got furlough, and it's
biting me in the ass.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.093
Healy said that there's nothing he can do.

05:18.176 --> 05:22.305
He can't ask for any more special favors
because it would look inappropriate.

05:24.307 --> 05:28.228
She buried me on that list
with, like, a dozen other people.

05:30.522 --> 05:32.399
Ruiz has a new baby.

05:33.775 --> 05:36.903
Well, I'm gonna miss you...
'cause you were a decent person.

05:36.987 --> 05:38.238
And do you know what
the worst part of it is?

05:38.321 --> 05:42.659
Telling my family and realizing that
they actually sounded kind of relieved,

05:42.743 --> 05:46.413
like they weren't gonna have to spend
hours coming to visit me anymore,

05:46.497 --> 05:48.248
like they finally got their weekends back.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.208
I mean, you should've heard my mother.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.503
She sounded practically cheerful.

05:52.586 --> 05:58.174
"Well... you only have eight months.
It's not like that's forever."

05:58.258 --> 06:00.844
Eight months is forever.

06:00.927 --> 06:05.348
It's like the less time
you got, the slower it goes.

06:06.349 --> 06:08.560
All right, I got to go.

06:11.522 --> 06:12.564
Hey, Morello?

06:15.526 --> 06:19.029
You know, you were the first person
that was nice to me when I got here.

06:20.739 --> 06:22.574
I was really scared.

06:24.242 --> 06:27.538
You made me feel like it was gonna be okay.

06:29.665 --> 06:34.878
Well, I am gonna remember that
you said that... for my bad days.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.221
What's that supposed to be?

06:45.305 --> 06:48.559
It's a black flag.
International symbol for parley.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.061
And what are we, pirates?

06:51.144 --> 06:53.439
I don't banter. I'm an envoy.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.901
[whispering] The greenhouse. After work.

07:00.737 --> 07:04.199
I'll take two chicken
noodles and a Neosporin.

07:27.556 --> 07:29.182
[grunting softly]

07:50.245 --> 07:52.748
[grunting]

08:17.147 --> 08:19.065
Fuck you.

08:26.322 --> 08:27.323
[sighs]

08:27.991 --> 08:30.368
-[Fig] Nice socks.
-[Hoffman] Thanks.

08:32.663 --> 08:35.206
I'd like to alert you

08:35.289 --> 08:38.293
to a couple of line items
that feel a little wonky.

08:39.169 --> 08:40.754
Okay.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.380
For instance...

08:42.462 --> 08:47.385
we've got 80 grand here allocated
to FitzCORE for the bathroom repair,

08:47.468 --> 08:51.389
but I thought that was included
in the fee we paid earlier

08:51.472 --> 08:54.350
for unspecified plumbing services.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.269
This is a much more extensive job.

08:56.352 --> 08:58.021
Right, I get that,

08:58.104 --> 09:01.191
but I feel like there's
some overlap happening.

09:03.359 --> 09:05.779
You're doing great work, Hoffman.

09:05.862 --> 09:07.656
Thanks.

09:07.739 --> 09:10.617
So, I think we should dig into this.

09:10.701 --> 09:15.038
Listen, my husband is
having a fundraiser tonight.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.959
Why don't you come as my
guest? Have a couple cocktails.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.419
The wife'll love it.

09:21.502 --> 09:24.005
I'm pretty sure Tiki
Barber is gonna be there.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.599
How's it going?

09:38.729 --> 09:39.855
What, me?

09:40.731 --> 09:43.399
I'm doing okay. Thanks for asking.

09:44.525 --> 09:47.570
You know, it's actually not possible
for you to ignore me forever.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.658
He moved.

09:51.742 --> 09:53.493
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

09:53.576 --> 09:56.663
The baby. He moved.

09:56.747 --> 10:00.333
When? Like now? Now?

10:00.416 --> 10:02.753
This morning and again after lunch.

10:02.836 --> 10:03.962
He's really in there.

10:05.756 --> 10:07.173
Can I...

10:07.257 --> 10:10.093
Can't feel nothin' on the
outside. He's too small.

10:10.176 --> 10:13.221
Wait, you're calling it a "he."

10:13.304 --> 10:15.431
My right boob is larger than the other one.

10:15.515 --> 10:21.021
Gloria says that means he's a boy,
and... I also keep craving salty stuff.

10:21.104 --> 10:24.107
I... You know, I always
wanted a boy, like...

10:25.776 --> 10:27.944
I mean, when I pictured it.

10:31.614 --> 10:35.493
How do you feel about, um... Frank...

10:35.576 --> 10:37.704
as a name?

10:37.788 --> 10:40.248
Frank? Like a hot dog?

10:40.331 --> 10:43.168
Ah, never mind. [Chuckles] It's...

10:45.086 --> 10:46.713
It could be a girl, I guess.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.926
Yeah.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.386
Yeah, I guess.

11:07.525 --> 11:09.069
Oh, shit.

11:09.152 --> 11:12.488
I seem to recall you saying that
she wasn't going to be a problem.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.324
How do you know it was even her?

11:16.117 --> 11:17.368
[sighs]

11:18.244 --> 11:20.413
A child does childish things.

11:20.496 --> 11:23.291
That little broomstick
just cost me serious money.

11:23.374 --> 11:25.251
Who's gonna pay me back? You?

11:25.335 --> 11:26.712
Look, I got no part in this.

11:26.795 --> 11:29.464
But you took responsibility.

11:31.507 --> 11:35.511
You think she'd be in here trashing
my shit if it wasn't for you?

11:37.513 --> 11:38.932
What are you gonna do to her?

11:39.015 --> 11:42.853
I'm a businesswoman. I'm gonna do...

11:42.936 --> 11:44.771
whatever it takes to neutralize the risk.

11:45.814 --> 11:47.190
Don't get crazy, Vee.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.276
She could have an
accident. That's one option.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.737
What's gonna happen then?

11:51.820 --> 11:55.281
The whole place goes on lockdown,
the COs tossin' everything.

11:55.365 --> 11:56.491
That's bad for business.

11:56.574 --> 11:57.658
[sighs]

11:57.743 --> 12:00.787
So, what's option two?

12:00.871 --> 12:04.332
Take away her incentive
to fight me, which is you.

12:04.415 --> 12:07.377
I can't have you around here anymore.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.587
But I'm your girl.

12:09.670 --> 12:13.133
I've been loyal to you
from day one. Ask anyone.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.425
I know that.

12:15.551 --> 12:16.970
You see, this whole thing with your friend,

12:17.053 --> 12:20.390
it is bringing me down,
it is attracting attention,

12:20.473 --> 12:22.558
and I can't have it anymore.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.978
I'll talk to her. I'll tell
her to stay away from...

12:25.061 --> 12:27.814
Look at this mess. Look at this mess.

12:27.898 --> 12:29.900
She left this for anyone to see.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.945
Now, what would've happened if a
CO had come in here before me, huh?

12:34.029 --> 12:37.157
She would rather have
you go to the fucking SHU

12:37.240 --> 12:38.741
than see you working for me.

12:40.035 --> 12:41.870
I'm sorry, Taystee.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.581
You said you would protect me.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.168
You said it was me and you together.

12:48.251 --> 12:50.711
I'm sure we'll see each other around.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.634
[Taystee] Yo, who wants hot wings?

12:56.717 --> 12:58.344
[laughs]

12:58.428 --> 13:01.389
Oh, why do you eat that shit?

13:01.472 --> 13:03.975
You know it's a scam to sell
off the trash of the chicken?

13:04.059 --> 13:05.852
Delicious trash.

13:05.936 --> 13:08.438
We used to cut the wings off and
throw 'em away. Did you know that?

13:08.521 --> 13:11.357
Then somebody figured out
if you smother 'em in sauce,

13:11.441 --> 13:13.234
you could talk people into
thinking that they were good.

13:13.318 --> 13:14.694
You ever notice...

13:14.777 --> 13:16.529
Girl, you ever notice

13:16.612 --> 13:21.409
that they don't ever put buffalo
sauce on no other chicken parts?

13:21.492 --> 13:24.370
Somebody got up on the
wrong side of the bed.

13:24.454 --> 13:28.041
Yo, hang up the GTA and get in here. RJ!

13:28.124 --> 13:29.750
I thought you were
gonna get Thai, you know,

13:29.835 --> 13:32.212
that curry soup with the noodles I like.

13:32.295 --> 13:33.922
We had this conversation.

13:34.005 --> 13:37.884
You said that you didn't trust a man
who wore flip-flops while he cooks.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.554
I'm tired, I guess. I
haven't been sleeping lately.

13:41.637 --> 13:44.224
I told you it was pizza, man.

13:44.307 --> 13:46.809
- You worried about somethin'?
- [chuckling]

13:46.893 --> 13:50.063
I sell smack. I'm always worried.

13:50.146 --> 13:53.233
Besides, my mattress is too hot.

13:53.316 --> 13:54.567
You sure you ain't sick?

13:54.650 --> 13:55.818
[exhales]

13:55.902 --> 13:58.029
No, I'm not sick. Get outta
here. I never get sick.

13:58.113 --> 14:00.156
You ain't sick, Vee. You just old.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.493
I had an aunt who was
always yelling and sweating.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.411
Couldn't remember a damn thing.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.413
Turned out, it was the change.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.334
Oh, my God.

14:13.836 --> 14:15.755
I'm too young for that shit.

14:16.714 --> 14:18.091
I thought I had more time.

14:18.174 --> 14:19.759
Hey, take it easy, now.

14:19.842 --> 14:24.264
Oh, I am 50 years old.

14:24.347 --> 14:25.640
What the fuck have I done with my life?

14:25.723 --> 14:28.768
I should've rent to own.
I should've got me a man!

14:28.851 --> 14:30.770
Well, you got us.

14:30.853 --> 14:34.565
How about you put off losing your mind
until you get a good night's sleep,

14:34.649 --> 14:36.734
and then you see how you feel then?

14:36.817 --> 14:39.946
Okay, we all know Trance says the
first dumb thing that come to his mind.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.865
Shit, I don't even believe you 50.

14:44.242 --> 14:46.411
You're still as fine as
the first day I met you.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.621
[chuckles] Boy, you so full of shit.

14:48.704 --> 14:51.166
You always the smoothest
bullshitter in this house.

14:51.249 --> 14:52.375
I'm serious, Vee.

14:53.251 --> 14:56.837
If you wasn't practically my mom,
I don't know what might happen.

14:56.922 --> 14:58.673
[both laugh]

14:58.756 --> 15:01.092
Boy, you better get outta here.

15:09.350 --> 15:12.353
You have to talk to
her, like, all the time.

15:14.230 --> 15:17.858
There's all these studies that say that
if... if you don't talk to the baby,

15:17.943 --> 15:20.653
they end up, like, fucked
by the time they're five.

15:20.736 --> 15:25.033
- Talk to her. Sing to her.
- [baby cries]

15:25.116 --> 15:26.659
You got to promise me, okay?

15:26.742 --> 15:29.329
You'll read to her while I'm in Virginia.

15:29.412 --> 15:34.542
All right, I know you don't like to
talk, but you gotta do it for her.

15:34.625 --> 15:38.088
Oh, you hear me, baby girl? Huh?

15:38.171 --> 15:41.549
I'm talking to you. That's
right, I'm talking to you.

15:41.632 --> 15:43.718
You grab Daddy's face
and you make him say shit

15:43.801 --> 15:46.179
so that you don't end up like me.

15:51.642 --> 15:52.935
Oh, this something new?

15:54.062 --> 15:57.523
You're supposed to keep your
hips up. Keeps the sperm in.

15:57.607 --> 15:58.608
Hmm.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.152
You should start getting ready.

16:03.446 --> 16:08.034
Hoffman's on to us. Not
on to us, but suspicious.

16:08.118 --> 16:12.247
Nah, we're bulletproof on his
end. Just don't make any mistakes.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.458
I don't wanna do this anymore.

16:16.501 --> 16:17.918
It was fun at first,

16:18.003 --> 16:19.462
- but now I'm not sleeping.
- [Jason sighs]

16:19.545 --> 16:20.880
If I got caught, can you imagine?

16:20.963 --> 16:23.633
Jesus, babe, you're getting cold feet now?

16:23.716 --> 16:26.094
You know, you gotta play
dirty if you wanna win.

16:26.177 --> 16:29.305
Rowley gets in office, he drives
the whole state off a cliff.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.515
I get it.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.559
This is my career we're talking about.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.353
And my career?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.106
[sighs]

16:42.402 --> 16:46.031
Look, you know I totally support
you, babe, in every way...

16:47.490 --> 16:50.701
but you're assistant warden in a prison.

16:50.785 --> 16:54.539
This is the senate. Think
of the doors it will open.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.749
[sighs]

16:58.751 --> 17:01.921
And maybe you'll get
pregnant, right? Who knows?

17:03.673 --> 17:05.675
I held up my end of the deal.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.344
Now you hold up yours.

17:12.848 --> 17:14.184
[creaking]

17:15.851 --> 17:17.436
[water bubbling]

17:22.358 --> 17:24.152
What the hell?

17:30.408 --> 17:32.285
Think about it, Vee.

17:32.368 --> 17:35.288
Do you really think I'd
do something so stupid?

17:35.371 --> 17:39.250
No, you're not stupid. Just pathetic.

17:39.334 --> 17:42.712
Just sent an old fool to do a
job that you're afraid to do.

17:47.467 --> 17:51.721
That old fool did exactly
what she was supposed to.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.348
Send a warning.

17:53.431 --> 17:55.766
Fuck with me, I fuck back.

17:55.850 --> 17:59.854
Really? 'Cause you know what
the message that I got was?

17:59.937 --> 18:01.106
You want a war.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.151
[chuckles] Except you
bungled the first shot.

18:05.235 --> 18:07.903
If she wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.655
Do you... do you wanna go?

18:10.906 --> 18:12.825
You know the sad part is,

18:12.908 --> 18:15.786
I was actually gonna share this
with you for old times' sake.

18:15.870 --> 18:19.290
But now my feelings are hurt,

18:19.374 --> 18:21.459
so I'm just gonna take it.

18:21.542 --> 18:25.171
Oh, well... I hope you enjoy it.

18:25.255 --> 18:28.007
If your people can find
the other end, of course.

18:28.090 --> 18:31.261
In the woods, in the middle of nowhere.

18:32.428 --> 18:33.429
How's your son?

18:34.430 --> 18:35.848
Yuri, right?

18:35.931 --> 18:39.560
Can you guess how many
Yuri Reznikovs there are

18:39.644 --> 18:43.273
in a two-hour driving
radius of Litchfield?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.733
Come on, guess.

18:45.816 --> 18:46.817
You're full of shit.

18:46.901 --> 18:49.570
There's only one.

18:49.654 --> 18:55.743
2364 Kenwood Road, or is
it 2346? I don't remember.

18:55.826 --> 19:00.248
But my boys tell me it's very
nice. Green house, white trim.

19:00.331 --> 19:01.707
[alarm blaring]

19:01.791 --> 19:07.380
You touch my son, I touch you.
Every bruise, every mark the same.

19:07.463 --> 19:09.048
You gonna fight me yourself, Red,

19:09.131 --> 19:13.052
or are you gonna send your
little army of midgets,

19:13.135 --> 19:15.721
crones to do it for you, huh?

19:15.805 --> 19:18.308
Norma, you might wanna talk
some sense into your friend here.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.810
Remind her of the last time
that she fucked with me.

19:21.936 --> 19:23.646
Broken ribs. [Gasping]

19:25.606 --> 19:27.525
[straining] Punctured lung.

19:27.608 --> 19:31.612
You're proud of that,
are you? We were friends.

19:31.696 --> 19:33.989
- We were never friends.
- [spits]

19:41.622 --> 19:44.124
- You'll regret that.
- [door closes]

19:45.167 --> 19:49.672
What is this? A tea party? What
are you even doing out here?

19:49.755 --> 19:51.257
We heard the alarm.

19:51.341 --> 19:55.052
It's not the lie-down-on-the-ground alarm,
it's the weather-related-emergency alarm.

19:55.135 --> 19:57.430
Let's go. Get back to the building.

19:57.513 --> 20:00.225
And remind me to give
you all shots. Let's go.

20:05.896 --> 20:06.897
[Vee] How's your wife?

20:07.523 --> 20:10.276
Eh, she's stressed about the kid.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.945
School wants to hold him back.
She takes that shit personal.

20:13.028 --> 20:17.742
Yeah, well, maybe you should take
her someplace, you know? Florida.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.785
And who'd look out for my pal, Vee?

20:19.869 --> 20:22.538
Tip her off to the action,
round up her competition.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.624
Your dedication is heartwarming.

20:24.707 --> 20:27.585
We're as close as can be,
right? Till the money runs out.

20:34.550 --> 20:39.013
Oh, by the way, we busted a couple
of supply guys across the bridge.

20:39.096 --> 20:40.890
They're bringing in this
cheap shit from India.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.184
Took down the whole setup,
books, cash, everything.

20:44.269 --> 20:46.521
New York's Finest.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.314
Your boy RJ was on their drop list.

20:48.398 --> 20:50.816
Same address. I checked.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.653
You ask me, he's going
into business for himself.

20:59.784 --> 21:02.745
Keep it moving, everyone.
Nice and calm, we all stay dry.

21:02.828 --> 21:05.581
Hey, man, how is rain
coming out the toilet?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.041
Can you explain me that?

21:07.124 --> 21:08.459
It's not rain. It's the lake.

21:08.543 --> 21:10.336
The sewer pipes are
open, the lake overflows,

21:10.420 --> 21:12.004
ground water comes up
through all the pipes.

21:12.087 --> 21:14.549
If it come down to swimming,
I'm gonna save myself.

21:14.632 --> 21:16.551
I will stand on a bitch's head.

21:16.634 --> 21:20.305
[woman on PA] Dorm A, C and
F, report to the cafeteria.

21:24.099 --> 21:27.186
Wet-nap? What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this, eat it?

21:27.269 --> 21:29.104
Probably tastes better than this.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.608
Butter pecan, and it's
from, like, two years ago.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.693
We get donations.

21:36.278 --> 21:37.780
You're killing us, Wanda.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.170
Come on, we'll go over
there. You bring your cards?

21:57.132 --> 22:00.428
Could be a long night. Got
anything to help me get through it?

22:00.511 --> 22:04.724
Get away from me, kibble
head. I am not in the mood.

22:07.643 --> 22:11.188
Pretty sure that this qualifies
as unsafe working conditions.

22:11.271 --> 22:13.691
Oh, yeah, I'm sure OSHA's
gonna be all over it.

22:13.774 --> 22:15.610
[electricity crackling]

22:15.693 --> 22:17.653
I don't know anything about generators.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.405
The generator's on the roof.

22:19.489 --> 22:21.407
We have to get the pumps working
so they'll push fuel up there.

22:21.491 --> 22:24.076
Also, I don't know anything about pumps.

22:24.159 --> 22:26.579
Hey, that's what he said.

22:26.662 --> 22:28.414
Come on, I can't make one stupid joke

22:28.498 --> 22:31.250
before I die from drowning
and/or electrocution?

22:31.333 --> 22:33.335
-[Luschek] Incoming.
-[Nicky] Ugh! Good...

22:33.419 --> 22:34.670
At least it's dead.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.672
Think of his brothers
heading upstairs to get dry.

22:37.548 --> 22:43.012
Okay, so tanks, pumps. [Clears throat]

22:43.095 --> 22:44.555
Let's get going.

22:44.639 --> 22:46.724
Man, how come nobody told me
these things were down here?

22:46.807 --> 22:49.727
I could've been cornering
the prison-hooch market.

22:49.810 --> 22:52.980
Look at this. They got taps
built in and everything.

22:53.731 --> 22:55.525
- [sighs]
- [indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

22:56.526 --> 23:00.320
Uh, Luschek? There's nothing in here.

23:01.864 --> 23:03.783
What the fuck?

23:09.705 --> 23:10.748
Both empty?

23:11.791 --> 23:13.626
Fig again. Am I right?

23:13.709 --> 23:15.210
[electricity crackles]

23:16.211 --> 23:18.130
[Nicky] Now what?

23:18.213 --> 23:19.965
Threesome?

23:20.049 --> 23:22.092
- [indistinct conversations]
- [band playing jazz]

23:29.600 --> 23:32.478
So, the irony is that Foucault's
analysis of power structures

23:32.562 --> 23:33.646
ends up being an argument

23:33.729 --> 23:37.567
against the institutions
of social inequality.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.359
I mean, we talk about this all
the time in the locker room.

23:39.444 --> 23:41.070
I don't know why this is so difficult.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.657
[laughs] So, then Jason says, "Let
me talk to her." I know, right?

23:44.740 --> 23:46.617
But he will not be swayed, so I put him on,

23:46.701 --> 23:50.705
and he sits there on the
phone with her for 20 minutes.

23:50.788 --> 23:53.958
I counted. Just listens to her whole story

23:54.041 --> 23:56.502
about the building permits and
the whole thing with the snakes,

23:56.586 --> 23:58.796
and I do not know how he
does it, but I swear to God,

23:58.879 --> 24:03.843
at the end of that conversation,
she writes him a check for $30.

24:03.926 --> 24:07.555
And that's when I knew,
this man belongs in Albany.

24:07.638 --> 24:09.348
Sorry, I need her for a minute.

24:09.431 --> 24:13.060
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse
me. It's good to see you.

24:13.143 --> 24:15.605
Thank you. God, if I have to
tell that story one more time...

24:15.688 --> 24:18.440
Joe Caputo again. This
makes call number six.

24:18.524 --> 24:22.444
It's like having children. I swear,
can't Mama have one night out?

24:23.571 --> 24:25.656
I guess I should call him back.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.449
FitzCORE just got here.

24:27.533 --> 24:30.703
Oh. Good, we need this guy to pony up.

24:30.786 --> 24:32.162
[thunder rumbling]

24:32.246 --> 24:33.498
[inhales deeply]

24:34.540 --> 24:38.043
Bob, so glad you made it. [Chuckles]

24:38.127 --> 24:40.462
Randy, Michelle, I'm
so sorry about the rain.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.714
I'm disappointed, Natalie.

24:41.797 --> 24:43.048
I thought for sure you'd figure out

24:43.132 --> 24:44.925
how to put the weather
off until after tonight.

24:45.009 --> 24:47.970
[chuckles] I could do it right
now, but it'd cost you extra.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.180
[chuckles] I'm not complaining
about the storm. Trust me.

24:50.264 --> 24:52.099
It's like money falling from the sky.

24:52.182 --> 24:55.728
I'm guessing that prison of yours is
gonna need some very expensive repairs.

24:55.811 --> 24:58.313
I am guessing you're right.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.900
- Lobster slider?
- Yes, please.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.657
[indistinct conversations]

25:16.957 --> 25:18.042
This way.

25:34.850 --> 25:37.352
Ah. Here.

25:46.195 --> 25:49.574
We keep the fence between us,
but we can all see each other.

25:49.657 --> 25:50.741
No surprises.

25:50.825 --> 25:53.703
You think she's gonna jump you tonight,

25:53.786 --> 25:56.956
in front of five COs and 200 witnesses?

25:57.039 --> 25:59.541
This is not a sane person
we are dealing with.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.087
Oh, man. I mean, the spirit is
willing and everything like that,

26:03.170 --> 26:07.091
but we got a serious problem
in terms of weight class,

26:07.174 --> 26:08.175
you know what I'm saying?

26:08.258 --> 26:11.178
We don't have the muscle,
so we've got to be smarter.

26:11.261 --> 26:13.222
Great, we'll challenge
them to a sudoku contest.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.807
[Red] Watch your tone, Gina.

26:16.558 --> 26:18.936
I want eyes on her all night.

26:19.019 --> 26:21.396
She doesn't move without
us knowing about it.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.564
Sleep in shifts.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.317
If you go somewhere, take a buddy.

26:31.573 --> 26:33.868
We supposed to be fightin' them? [Scoffs]

26:33.951 --> 26:36.495
'Cause that's the
Lollipop Guild over there.

26:36.578 --> 26:40.165
I don't know. Red's bringing all
kinds of shit from the outside.

26:40.249 --> 26:43.836
I hear she got a Taser
hidden away for just in case.

26:43.919 --> 26:47.256
Where exactly you think she
hiding it? In her coochie?

26:48.215 --> 26:49.967
Taser would fit right in there.

26:51.051 --> 26:53.345
Red's not a fighter. She's a schemer.

26:53.428 --> 26:54.471
She makes a move,

26:54.554 --> 26:57.057
it'll take us a week
to figure out it's her.

26:57.141 --> 27:02.187
Keep your eyes open. Don't
talk to anyone that isn't us.

27:02.271 --> 27:04.439
All right, listen up!

27:05.315 --> 27:09.028
This building's pipes are
now compromised by water,

27:09.111 --> 27:13.741
meaning there is absolutely
no working plumbing whatsoever.

27:13.824 --> 27:15.743
[inmates groaning]

27:15.826 --> 27:18.328
So, for the time being,

27:18.412 --> 27:21.707
you're gonna answer nature's
call in the honey bucket.

27:21.791 --> 27:23.208
- [inmates groaning]
- [woman] Are you serious?

So, we will be discussing

40:34.874 --> 40:37.586
the future of your career
at the DOC when I get back,

40:37.669 --> 40:41.130
but for now, I need you
to suck it the fuck up,

40:41.214 --> 40:45.009
ride this out, stop crying,

40:45.093 --> 40:47.261
and stop calling me.

40:48.304 --> 40:50.849
[stammers] Hello?

40:56.187 --> 40:58.732
Five minutes left for the silent auction!

40:58.815 --> 41:00.191
[Bennett] Think of a happy
place. Someplace nice,

41:00.274 --> 41:03.152
like a beautiful beach,
or like a mountain, or...

41:03.236 --> 41:04.571
Does she like beaches or mountains or...

41:04.654 --> 41:07.741
I don't... She likes the comic
book store on Morris Park.

41:07.824 --> 41:10.076
Okay, yeah, so comics.
There's comics everywhere.

41:10.159 --> 41:12.203
Just a sea of comics as
far as your eye can see.

41:12.286 --> 41:15.707
A cocoon of comic books
just comforting you.

41:15.790 --> 41:17.208
On your feet, Diaz.

41:17.291 --> 41:18.752
Hey, come on, man, she's not doing well.

41:18.835 --> 41:19.961
I said, get up!

41:20.044 --> 41:22.255
Do you really have to be a dick right now?

41:23.632 --> 41:25.174
[breathing heavily]

41:25.258 --> 41:27.426
[Donaldson] Jumping jacks. 20. Go.

41:27.511 --> 41:28.512
[sobbing] I can't.

41:28.595 --> 41:31.264
- You defying an officer?
- Do it.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.308
[heavy breathing continues]

41:35.309 --> 41:37.979
One, two, two, three...

41:38.062 --> 41:39.814
You gonna do something?

41:40.940 --> 41:42.901
I'm gonna get Caputo.

41:42.984 --> 41:48.364
- Out loud.
- ... six, seven, eight, nine...

41:49.866 --> 41:51.576
[breathing normally]

41:51.660 --> 41:53.411
Keep breathin'. Count your breaths.

41:55.204 --> 41:56.455
Yeah, okay.

41:57.373 --> 41:58.499
[sighs]

42:07.050 --> 42:08.259
Incoming.

42:10.178 --> 42:11.262
[whispering] Can I help?

42:11.345 --> 42:14.015
It's PB and J. I feel like I got this.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.853
You're putting the jelly
too close to the edges.

42:18.937 --> 42:22.065
You got to even it out, or it leaks.

42:22.148 --> 42:23.191
Is this happening?

42:27.779 --> 42:29.363
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.533
Practically nothing.

42:34.410 --> 42:36.495
You've got the keys to the knife cage?

42:36.580 --> 42:38.998
Just drop them on the
ground, find them again later.

42:39.082 --> 42:41.125
It's an easy mistake.

42:41.209 --> 42:43.795
It's for self-defense.

42:43.878 --> 42:46.798
And when a knife comes up missing,
what do you think's gonna happen to me?

42:46.881 --> 42:50.885
"Oh, she lost the keys, so
let's go easy on her ass."

42:50.969 --> 42:52.679
She's going to kill me, Mendoza.

42:52.762 --> 42:55.640
What, in front of the whole prison?
Man, you are paranoid as shit.

42:55.724 --> 42:59.603
Fine, forget the knife.
Just give me something sharp.

42:59.686 --> 43:01.270
The cheese grater.

43:01.354 --> 43:03.397
[speaking Spanish] She's
really bumming me out.

43:04.565 --> 43:07.318
You used to be something,
you know that, Red?

43:07.401 --> 43:11.447
Now you lost your damn mind. And it's sad.

43:11.530 --> 43:14.909
She don't need to fight
you, 'cause she already won.

43:24.418 --> 43:25.837
[snoring]

43:31.592 --> 43:33.637
[indistinct conversations]

43:46.691 --> 43:48.777
Miss Rosa?

43:48.860 --> 43:51.863
Oh, jeez. All right. Hey, hey.

43:51.946 --> 43:53.990
- I'm not dead yet.
- [chuckles]

43:55.033 --> 43:57.451
If that's what's itching you.

43:57.535 --> 44:00.413
No. No, I thought...

44:00.496 --> 44:03.249
I mean, I know it's not looking so good.

44:04.793 --> 44:08.087
It's not the dying that's the bad part.

44:10.506 --> 44:13.885
It's that I gotta do it here, you know?

44:16.595 --> 44:21.392
The last thing I'm gonna
see... is you assholes.

44:21.475 --> 44:22.686
[sighs]

45:00.348 --> 45:02.100
You scared me for a minute there.

45:02.183 --> 45:04.352
What's gonna happen when she's born?

45:07.063 --> 45:08.689
Um...

45:08.773 --> 45:11.025
Well, they'll let your
mom's family take her.

45:12.235 --> 45:13.945
I can go see her sometimes.

45:14.028 --> 45:15.654
And then what?

45:16.990 --> 45:19.408
You gonna tell her you're her daddy?

45:19.492 --> 45:21.452
But she needs to keep her mouth shut

45:21.535 --> 45:25.123
because everybody thinks that
she has a different daddy?

45:25.206 --> 45:29.252
And that daddy's in jail because
he put his dick in Mommy...

45:30.879 --> 45:32.546
but be cool?

45:38.887 --> 45:42.598
I should never have given
you that gum... should I?

45:43.892 --> 45:45.726
You did a lot of stupid things.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.815
And so did I. It was both of us.

45:52.275 --> 45:54.110
But it doesn't matter anymore.

45:55.153 --> 45:57.738
We have to do what's best for the kid.

45:57.822 --> 45:59.323
Which is what?

46:01.159 --> 46:02.535
Confess.

46:02.618 --> 46:05.246
- And go to prison?
- Yeah.

46:05.329 --> 46:08.666
Go to prison. Do your time.

46:08.749 --> 46:10.334
I'll tell him I love you.

46:10.418 --> 46:15.339
We'll both get out in a few
years, we're done with this place,

46:15.423 --> 46:16.925
we're a family.

46:19.260 --> 46:20.428
[sighs]

46:22.096 --> 46:23.097
Or...

46:26.100 --> 46:27.101
walk away.

46:28.602 --> 46:30.438
I won't blame you.

46:31.647 --> 46:33.817
Get a fresh start.

46:33.900 --> 46:35.651
It's like this never happened.

46:36.610 --> 46:38.905
This whole mess is on Mendez.

46:40.781 --> 46:43.284
My baby won't grow up confused.

46:44.368 --> 46:45.369
[sighs]

46:46.412 --> 46:49.123
You think I'm the kind of man
that walks away from my kid?

46:51.084 --> 46:53.502
[scoffs] Dummy.

46:54.462 --> 46:57.631
You got a chance right
now to go back in time.

46:59.008 --> 47:00.969
If someone gave that to me,

47:02.011 --> 47:05.473
I would sure as hell be thinking about it.

47:14.023 --> 47:18.444
Do you ever think about why
we wear clothes all the time?

47:18.527 --> 47:22.615
Like, really think about it?

47:24.993 --> 47:27.161
I feel trapped inside my face.

47:29.830 --> 47:32.250
We got 3 inches of water in the bunks.

47:32.333 --> 47:34.961
And now the water's coming
in under the library door.

47:35.044 --> 47:36.254
Yo, what about the books?

47:36.337 --> 47:39.090
- What about 'em?
- They'll get ruined.

47:39.173 --> 47:41.675
Yo, that shit's worth money. You
know how pissed they'd be upstairs?

47:45.846 --> 47:48.599
Go on. Get 'em up on a high
shelf. I'll check on you in a few.

47:48.682 --> 47:50.143
And... and take a buddy.

47:51.269 --> 47:54.898
You. Yeah, you know the
library. Go with her.

47:54.981 --> 47:56.900
And pull the expensive stuff first.

47:58.526 --> 48:00.319
[Yoga Jones] Roll up.

48:03.322 --> 48:04.323
[sighs]

48:05.366 --> 48:08.702
Stress goes right to the spine.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.373
- How's Sister?
- Still in medical.

48:13.749 --> 48:16.335
Being force-fed, presumably.

48:16.419 --> 48:18.462
She makes me ashamed of myself.

48:18.546 --> 48:20.298
It is not her.

48:20.381 --> 48:21.966
It's Fig again.

48:22.883 --> 48:25.178
Who does that to an old lady?

48:25.261 --> 48:28.514
They always win one way or another.

48:28.597 --> 48:32.726
And if they can't, they
just transfer us away.

48:36.522 --> 48:38.482
I'm so scared.

48:38.566 --> 48:40.693
It's so cold on the plane,

48:40.776 --> 48:43.737
and the men, they just stare.

48:44.822 --> 48:48.409
Then you get off and you're in this
place where you don't know anyone.

48:51.912 --> 48:54.123
I spent five months at Alderson.

48:54.207 --> 48:56.542
Was it like here?

48:57.668 --> 48:59.628
It was awesome.

49:00.713 --> 49:03.132
I mean, as far as being
deprived of your personal freedom

49:03.216 --> 49:04.508
and civil liberties goes.

49:04.592 --> 49:09.013
They had a crafts shop
and a volleyball team.

49:09.097 --> 49:10.974
I had Martha Stewart's old bunk.

49:11.057 --> 49:12.683
[rat squeaking]

49:18.606 --> 49:20.649
This place is bullshit.

49:46.467 --> 49:47.468
[grunts]

49:47.551 --> 49:48.802
[choking]

49:51.139 --> 49:53.516
You got more balls than I thought.

49:53.599 --> 49:55.643
Who's pathetic now?

49:56.810 --> 49:58.062
[both grunting]

50:01.232 --> 50:02.608
[coughs]

50:13.994 --> 50:15.163
Oh, God!

50:18.791 --> 50:20.168
Go ahead. Go ahead.

50:28.217 --> 50:30.261
[both gasping]

50:31.345 --> 50:33.722
This place is getting to me.

50:33.806 --> 50:35.683
[gasps] Oh, yeah.

50:36.642 --> 50:39.687
You just tried to strangle
me with plastic wrap

50:39.770 --> 50:41.855
so that you can sell mascara in jail.

50:42.856 --> 50:44.067
[laughs]

50:49.363 --> 50:51.157
This is stupid.

50:52.116 --> 50:54.660
Take what you want. What do I care?

50:54.743 --> 50:57.037
What am I trying to prove?

50:57.121 --> 51:00.833
[sighs] You keep yours,
I'll keep mine, all right?

51:00.916 --> 51:04.087
We've got enough fucking
hell in here already.

51:14.888 --> 51:16.390
Truce.

51:18.767 --> 51:19.852
Truce.

51:27.110 --> 51:30.154
You couldn't try to
kill me someplace drier?

51:35.409 --> 51:36.869
[both panting]

51:36.952 --> 51:38.704
[rap music playing over stereo]

51:38.787 --> 51:40.998
Oh, God.

51:41.081 --> 51:43.876
Oh, you know what I want right now?

51:43.959 --> 51:45.669
What?

51:45.753 --> 51:46.962
Oh, God, a Bomb Pop.

51:47.963 --> 51:49.507
[laughs]

51:49.590 --> 51:51.259
[chuckles]

51:52.760 --> 51:55.179
I need a fucking popsicle.

51:55.263 --> 51:57.681
Red, white, and blue. Very patriotic.

52:00.100 --> 52:01.852
You feeling patriotic now?

52:03.146 --> 52:07.191
Come on, now, remember what I taught
you. Always treat your lady like a queen.

52:07.275 --> 52:09.443
You go get it for me,

52:10.611 --> 52:13.572
I might let you do that last thing again.

52:16.909 --> 52:18.118
[sighs]

52:19.870 --> 52:21.289
- Fuck.
- Go on, now.

52:33.426 --> 52:36.136
- [Vee] Thank you, baby.
- Yeah.

52:43.269 --> 52:44.312
Mmm.

53:05.541 --> 53:06.834
[beeping]

53:20.264 --> 53:21.640
What's up, RJ?

53:22.516 --> 53:23.517
I ain't done nothin', man.

53:23.601 --> 53:24.977
I'm just going to get ice cream. That's it.

53:25.060 --> 53:27.771
- Catch.
- What the fuck?

53:27.855 --> 53:30.358
I got a runner on the
steps at McMullen Park.

53:30.441 --> 53:35.112
African-American male, early
20's, armed and aggressive.

53:35.195 --> 53:36.447
Request backup.

53:36.530 --> 53:38.449
Oh, no. Please don't do this, man.

53:38.532 --> 53:39.533
Please, Officer, don't...

53:40.909 --> 53:42.077
[thudding]

53:50.711 --> 53:53.297
You gonna help or just
stand there creepin' me out?

53:53.381 --> 53:54.673
Fuck you.

54:01.096 --> 54:02.890
So, what's Vee gonna do to me?

54:02.973 --> 54:04.725
She ain't gonna do nothin' to you.

54:06.059 --> 54:07.936
[scoffs] Right.

54:08.020 --> 54:09.897
She threw me out.

54:11.148 --> 54:13.651
That's what you wanted, ain't it?

54:14.693 --> 54:16.153
You win.

54:16.236 --> 54:20.574
The only person that ever looked
out for me in my entire life,

54:20.658 --> 54:21.992
you got her back to turn.

54:22.075 --> 54:23.619
The only person?

54:24.912 --> 54:26.414
Well, fuck you.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.332
You ruined everything.

54:29.583 --> 54:31.585
You... you couldn't just be my friend.

54:31.669 --> 54:33.671
You gotta... you gotta go turn it wrong.

54:33.754 --> 54:35.673
You gotta... Wanna take off my clothes...

54:35.756 --> 54:37.132
Oh, God, when did I ever
say a word to you about...

54:37.215 --> 54:39.593
You said... you said plenty of words.

54:39.677 --> 54:45.391
You couldn't let me have
one damn thing to myself.

54:47.017 --> 54:48.852
She's not a good person, Taystee.

54:48.936 --> 54:51.939
I don't care.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.358
You fucked up my life.

54:57.027 --> 54:58.028
[scoffs]

54:59.029 --> 55:00.030
I'm done.

55:00.113 --> 55:01.782
You just gonna walk away now, too?

55:01.865 --> 55:03.576
What the... [grunts]

55:09.206 --> 55:10.708
Hey.

55:14.795 --> 55:18.382
[sobbing] Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

55:18.466 --> 55:19.800
[sobbing]

55:19.883 --> 55:21.218
I'm sorry, P.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.055
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

55:25.138 --> 55:27.350
- I'm sorry.
- I know. I know.

55:27.433 --> 55:29.226
[both sobbing]

55:33.105 --> 55:34.648
[Bell snoring]

55:51.374 --> 55:53.459
[Bell continues snoring]

56:55.896 --> 56:57.355
[Piper gasps]

56:59.316 --> 57:01.485
You want to explain?

57:39.022 --> 57:40.691
[birds chirping]

57:56.456 --> 57:57.625
[sighs]

58:04.673 --> 58:05.924
[groans]

58:19.688 --> 58:20.981
Ohh!

58:21.524 --> 58:23.567
Ohh! Ohh!
