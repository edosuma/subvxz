00:46.147 --> 00:48.849
Maestro!

00:48.849 --> 00:50.118
Grazie.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.952
Maestro,
welcome to Venice.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.322
I'm Beppi Bertelli.
How tremendous
to see you here.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.756
- Yes.
- Mind your step,
slippery.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.125
- Ah, that's okay.
- How was your flight?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.159
Are you jet lagged?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.293
No jet lag.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.295
Ah, the mark of
a good conscience.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.931
You know, Alessandra
will be so exited to see you.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.966
We are all so delighted.
Wait.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.570
You see?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.172
I roll out
the red carpet for you.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.206
Okay.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.242
Prego.
Let me step out.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.977
Only you, maestro,
you are the only conductor

01:16.977 --> 01:18.679
she would sing with.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.048
"Please, Beppi,
bring me Rodrigo.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.816
"Only then will I do
the concert."

01:22.816 --> 01:24.452
I understand,
I understand.
I'm flattered.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.155
Never flatter.
Not with a genius
such as yourself.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.890
No, I-- Now,
may I present to you

01:29.890 --> 01:32.293
- a couple of tiny
items of advice?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.062
Most of the gondoliers
are thieves and rogues.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.165
If you must take
a ride on a gondola,

01:37.165 --> 01:40.067
I beg you,
negotiate the price first.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.034
That's why I brought
my bicicletta.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.035
- Bravo.
- Eh?

01:42.035 --> 01:43.371
Second,

01:43.371 --> 01:44.872
if you are ordering
a pasta dish

01:44.872 --> 01:47.908
with seafood or lovely
shrimps or clams
or cuttle fish,

01:47.908 --> 01:49.710
which I adore,
do not,

01:49.710 --> 01:52.380
I repeat, do not ask for
parmigiano cheese

01:52.380 --> 01:54.482
to put on the pasta.
This is not done.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.218
- It will insult the chef.
- I don't want to insult
the chef.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.819
Uh, this way, eh?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.188
Mm, this way.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.393
And one last
little thing.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.429
Whatever you do,
please...

02:08.429 --> 02:11.832
do not make love
with her.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.402
No fornicate.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.604
No fornicate.
Grazie.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.905
- Okay.
- What a great pleasure.

02:17.905 --> 02:18.872
What a tremendous honor.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.907
Mm-hm, yes.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.276
This concert
will be legendary.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.878
Legendary.
And then we talk, uh?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.614
- After...
- Maybe.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.655
Fornicate.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.390
No fornicate.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.104
Buongiorno.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.520
Buongiorno.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.088
Maestro.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.657
How delightful
you're here.

03:09.657 --> 03:13.026
Oh, yes,
this is so delightful.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.828
It is mythological for me.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.697
This is such an honor,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.966
such a pleasure
to meet you.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.769
I recognize
the recording.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.937
"Les Filles de Cadix."

03:23.937 --> 03:27.107
Vous chanté a
La Palais Garnier,
2002. Right?

03:27.107 --> 03:28.409
Very good.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.478
Yes.
I wanted to ask you,

03:30.478 --> 03:32.346
did you have a slight cold
that evening?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.282
I had a terrible cold.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.317
I finished the performance
and collapsed.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.587
Yes, because your voice
had a beautiful...

03:39.587 --> 03:40.988
una bellissima tessitura.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.022
You speak Italian?

03:53.301 --> 03:55.168
We speak in English.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.470
More simple.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.772
- Have you eaten?
- No.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.341
I was making us
a little lunch.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.343
- Come.
- Okay.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.812
- Come.
- Si.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.315
Would you mind
tying this for me?

04:07.315 --> 04:08.316
Oh, yes, yes.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.083
Grazie.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.785
Ai.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.889
Oh, I like your kitchen
a lot. A lot.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.858
It's the place in the house
where I feel most comfortable.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.093
Mm.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.130
Everywhere else,
I'm a peasant in
a palazzo.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.967
You know, right now
I'm in the mood for
no home. You know?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.069
Vagabond style.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.404
But you should
try owning

04:30.404 --> 04:33.507
a 600 year old house
in Venice.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.208
Everything is sinking.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.978
The first floor is
flooded half the time,

04:37.978 --> 04:39.913
the mold makes you sneeze,

04:39.913 --> 04:43.116
but this is my hometown,
and I love it.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.619
And that is important,
no?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.688
- Home.
- Oh, yes.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.057
Yes, it is
very important.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.224
Yes.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.061
A little pasta nera
with cuttle fish.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.095
Hope you like it.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.364
Mm, it smells so good.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.367
Would you care for
some parmigiano?

04:59.367 --> 05:03.437
Mm, no, niente, no.
Never with fish. Thank you.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.905
Grazie.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.209
- Maestro.
- Mm?

05:09.209 --> 05:12.380
I'm sure you have
a question for me.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.982
After four years,
can I still sing?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.751
Well, I'm sure you can
still sing, of course.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.820
If not, you would never
attempt to do this concert.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.990
Well, people do
foolish things.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.893
Perhaps I can still
sing in my shower. No?

05:25.893 --> 05:31.499
But everyone believes
they are a great singer
in the shower.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.534
I was sorry to hear
about your orchestra.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.570
- Mm.
- I admire what you're
trying to do to bring--

05:36.570 --> 05:40.408
How you like to say?
The blood to that

05:40.408 --> 05:42.009
sad old symphony.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.010
It's very sad.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.278
But it was getting
less sadder

05:45.278 --> 05:46.880
because we were
getting better,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.416
but we got strangled
by the red tape.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.450
- You know?
- Yes.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.484
The fucking red tape.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.053
Money, money,
always money.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.087
I know.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.790
Beppi wants me to come back,
to go on tour,

05:56.790 --> 05:59.460
to do this concert,
to be La Fiamma again,

05:59.460 --> 06:01.128
because of the money.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.898
How is the pasta?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.337
It is so good.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.539
Not overcooked?

06:11.539 --> 06:14.442
It is excellent.
Just right.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.278
My dear maestro,
I'm very sorry that

06:18.278 --> 06:20.448
you have come all this way
for nothing.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.549
For nothing?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.717
I'm afraid that
it is impossible

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
that this concert
should proceed.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.856
- No, but--
- I have enjoyed
meeting you.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.891
You are clearly
very brilliant.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.361
And you'll have many
triumphs in your future.

06:34.361 --> 06:37.465
Now I must
do the dishes,

06:37.465 --> 06:38.999
and then take
little nap.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.603
And please tell Beppi
finita la comedia.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.475
Alessandra.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.777
The pasta was
overcooked.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.011
By at least
three minutes.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.279
Four and a half.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.381
Well, I'm not here to
conduct your cooking.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.717
And if my singing
is overcooked.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.185
I will never allow that.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.753
Never.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.388
You want to talk about
the blood,

07:01.388 --> 07:06.494
well, my heart,
it has been bleeding
for a while.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.899
And I think your voice
is the only thing that
can save it.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.567
I fell in love
with your voice

07:13.567 --> 07:15.002
the first time
I heard it.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.506
I was 13 years old.
Maestro Rivera brought it.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.008
And it was you
in "Tosca."

07:21.008 --> 07:23.410
I heard it over
and over again.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.145
I would imagine
these things.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.981
I would do things that--

07:27.981 --> 07:31.118
I'm not gonna tell you
what I did, but--

07:31.118 --> 07:35.288
but the moment that I heard
that you stopped singing,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.558
I wept.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.259
You can come up
with many reasons

07:39.259 --> 07:40.894
why not to do something.

07:40.894 --> 07:45.599
But the real reason why
to do something important,

07:45.599 --> 07:47.367
there's only one reason.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.436
And what is the reason?

07:49.436 --> 07:50.638
You know.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.774
But, dear maestro,

07:53.774 --> 07:57.711
I'm sorry but
if you can't stand tears,

07:57.711 --> 08:02.382
you should stay away
from the opera.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.551
Goodbye.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.258
Andrew is running late,

08:11.258 --> 08:13.293
he said we should do
sound check without him.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.427
What a shocker.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.829
He's probably taking

08:15.829 --> 08:17.798
a few hours extra sleep
at the Ritz.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.466
No, he's gotta sleep off
the Dom Perignon.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.635
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
all right.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.103
Let's pick up the tempo
on this one.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.072
We want to get to
my solo quicker.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.575
Remember, it's the
Andrew Walsh Ensemble,

08:27.575 --> 08:30.010
not the Andrew Walsh
Ensemble ensemble.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.780
Okay, let's read
the score.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.482
Uh, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

08:35.482 --> 08:36.616
my solo.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.285
Okay, and then
bullshit, bullshit,

08:39.285 --> 08:40.352
ah, yeah, my solo.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.158
Maybe we just call it the
Hailey Rutlege Ensemble.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.393
Sorry.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.896
No. No, Hailey,
don't stop on my account.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.097
I was enjoying it.
It's hilarious.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.599
- I was just, uh--
- No, you were just

08:51.599 --> 08:53.333
trying to make me look
like an asshole.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.802
It's not that hard.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.469
Anyway, the traffic
was better than I thought,

08:56.469 --> 08:58.038
so I'm here.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.774
Hailey, is it true I do that,
uh, Stevie Wonder thing?

09:00.774 --> 09:03.143
With my head and-- No?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.211
Don't answer.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.313
All right, we have
a lot of work to do.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.148
We leave Austria tomorrow,

09:08.148 --> 09:09.983
and then arrive in Venice
for the festival.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.953
And we need to be ready
to play with shock and awe.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.922
And awe stand for,
ladies?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.957
Andrew Walsh Ensemble.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.359
Exactly.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.295
So, Hailey, is there
a particular piece

09:22.295 --> 09:24.331
that you feel that
I'm rushing the tempo on?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.733
Uh...

09:25.733 --> 09:27.635
Hey, I'm all ears.
Whaddaya got?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.703
Maybe the Vivaldi piece?

09:29.703 --> 09:30.904
See, that's a question.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.372
Can you be definitive?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.207
You are fucking up
the Vivaldi.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.475
No, because I don't think
that you are

09:35.475 --> 09:37.110
fucking up
the Vivaldi piece,

09:37.110 --> 09:40.380
- I just--
- I'm just yanking
your woodwind, Hailey.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.515
Easy. Easy.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.819
- It's just--
- Uh, yes?

09:45.819 --> 09:46.987
I just think that
we're taking

09:46.987 --> 09:49.422
a similar approach
tempo wise

09:49.422 --> 09:52.225
um, to the Fauré.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.795
And that's not how
Maestro DeSousa
would do it?

09:54.795 --> 09:57.197
Probably not.
Uh, yeah.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.868
Well, maybe I just have a
greater sense of urgency

10:00.868 --> 10:02.502
than old Rodrigo does.

10:02.502 --> 10:06.339
Uh, in fact,
let's start with
the Fauré, shall we?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.141
Follow me, ladies.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.409
And gentleman?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.444
Debatable.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.842
Que lindo.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.428
Some people shouldn't be
allowed to sing.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.830
I couldn't agree more.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.332
And some people should not
be allowed to conduct.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.567
I hope you're not
referring to me, Wolfgang.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.137
Well, I'm not
referring to myself.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.304
Is that the way
you're gonna be?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.273
Why? Why? Why?
Why after so many years,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.742
you're still like
a spoiled brat?

11:14.742 --> 11:16.009
Why?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.011
Why do you always have to
smell your own farts?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.447
- Deserter.
- De-- I'm not
a deserter.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.749
Don't call me
a deserter.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.752
I'm-- I'm loyal.
I am soldado de la musica.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.653
Soldado de la musica.
Muy soldado.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.089
So sensitive.

11:29.089 --> 11:32.159
Of course,
I had a soft spot
for singers, too.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.594
And if I can tell you
one thing,

11:34.594 --> 11:37.597
they're all crazy.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.300
And you know,
I-- I've never--

11:40.300 --> 11:43.536
I've never been with a,
you know, close to a--
to a singer.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.571
I don't know why.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.606
Maybe you never will.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.675
You're off to
a pretty bad start.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.844
- Mm.
- Soon, no one,

11:50.844 --> 11:54.081
no one will want to
play with you.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.683
I think this young lady

11:56.683 --> 11:58.251
might have
something for you.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.863
La Fenice,
midnight.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.856
Maestro, my hero.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.258
She's here.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.660
She appears to be happy.
She's ready to rehearse.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.895
We will have
a great concert,

15:28.895 --> 15:29.997
an historic event.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.864
Yes, Beppi, we will,
we will.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.300
But there's
a lot of work to do.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.534
- Of course.
- A lot.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.503
- Of course.
- A lot of work to do.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.804
- Yes.
- Is this the
conservatory?

15:37.804 --> 15:38.838
Yes,
the music school.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.508
Everyone,
this is my maestro,

15:41.508 --> 15:43.743
and I trust him
in every single way.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.079
Okay, well,
here is the program

15:46.079 --> 15:47.347
we will be presenting.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.550
Okay. Yes.
I saw it this morning.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.153
And, um--

15:53.153 --> 15:54.554
It's like the
greatest hits, no?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.256
These are many of
the great arias

15:56.256 --> 15:57.757
which La Fiamma
has been know for

15:57.757 --> 15:58.891
over her
illustrious career.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.260
Yes.

16:00.260 --> 16:04.231
What? You do not
approve of these choices?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.766
It's just that
I think that we can

16:06.766 --> 16:08.601
present a new
Alessandra

16:08.601 --> 16:11.538
that doesn't compete
with the old Alessandra,
you know?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.774
You think I can no longer
sing these roles?

16:14.774 --> 16:17.044
No, yes,
I'm sure you can.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.945
But perhaps not as good
as you once did.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.315
- Hey.
- But there are many,
many good roles,

16:22.315 --> 16:23.883
amazing roles,
that before

16:23.883 --> 16:25.618
you couldn't
be able to sing.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.187
And now you can.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.356
What happened to the man
that was too gentle

16:29.356 --> 16:32.459
to tell my my pasta
was overcooked?

16:32.459 --> 16:35.128
These new arias.
What are you thinking?

16:35.128 --> 16:37.264
"Samson and Delilah,"
for example.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.232
It's a mezzo soprano role.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.334
No!

16:41.334 --> 16:44.637
Or a new piece by
a contemporary composer.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.638
Contemporary composer?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.640
Perhaps if there was
any composer alive

16:47.640 --> 16:49.109
as great as Puccini.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.677
Oh, but how can they
be great

16:50.677 --> 16:52.112
if none of the
greatest performers
perform their work?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.381
But what you don't
understand, Maestro,

16:54.381 --> 16:55.815
is that the Italian
opera audience

16:55.815 --> 16:57.084
is very, very big here.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.818
My maestro has spoken.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.120
How dare you question him.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.588
I only want the best
for you, my dear.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.890
You want to destroy
my confidence.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.558
You care nothing
about me.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.095
For you it is just
money, money, money.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.296
Alessandra--

17:12.499 --> 17:16.203
Bene. Maestro, thank you
so much for educating me.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.337
I'm your humble servant.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.107
Please commence
to create the magic.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.613
Hmph.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.016
Good.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.330
I thought it was, like,
an older looking city.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.665
Yes.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.934
All right,
give me innocence
with your mouth.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.202
Oh, my mouth.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.204
Great.
Now give me slutty.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.239
- Yes.
- Yeah, right?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.940
Work that angle.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.808
Okay, I want to
cross off every site on
my Venice to do list,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.009
so we should
probably go.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.445
Well,
Piazza San Marco is done.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.646
- Okay.
- Where should we go next?

17:59.646 --> 18:02.282
- Uh, Ponte Rialto.
- Great.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.584
- Ponte Rialto.
- How long is this list?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.220
It is very long-ay,
long-ay.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.455
There's no distinction,
I feel,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.290
like,
between the pieces.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.992
He's just doing Sibelius
the same as he's doing Mozart,

18:12.992 --> 18:14.227
the same as he's doing
the Ravel,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.563
and I resent him
for that.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.897
And do you notice that
every time you have sex
with him,

18:17.897 --> 18:18.931
it's exactly the same?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.367
I only had sex
with him once.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.401
You've only had sex
with him once?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.702
- Yes!
- Oh, okay.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.504
Well, I can tell you
from experience,

18:24.504 --> 18:25.705
it is always
exactly the same.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.240
- Well--
- Every single stage.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.341
Did he paint f-holes
on your back?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.709
- Yes, he did.
- Oh, fuck!

18:29.709 --> 18:32.779
How do you know that?
He did that for you?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.514
- He had to shave
my back first--
- Humiliating.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.283
- 'Cause it's hairy, though.
- Oh, my God.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.084
- Yeah.
- Did he do it himself?

18:38.084 --> 18:39.919
- Yeah, he did.
Like, lathered it up--
- Okay, I like him, like,

18:39.919 --> 18:42.054
- four more points
because of that.
- Applied it on.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.324
- What a sicko.
- And razored it off
slowly.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.025
- The Rialto Bridge.
- Done.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.194
- Done.
- Kind of a bust.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.262
- Kind of.
- On to the next.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.232
Oh, check him out.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.966
That mime is hot.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.741
Hello.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.377
My friend over there
thinks that you are hot,

19:04.377 --> 19:06.879
so I think that
you should come to
our concert tonight.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.916
- So--
- I think you're hot.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.452
Oh, my God,
you speak. Wow.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.254
I'm from Belgium,
I'm here for the festival.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.822
Oh. Cool.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.226
Would you maybe want
to come for a coffee
back to my hotel?

19:22.662 --> 19:25.632
Is it like a real...
hotel, or...?

19:25.632 --> 19:29.236
It is a real hotel.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.637
Okay.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.680
As long as he didn't mime
putting on a condom.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.815
Stop. Move.
Quicker.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.118
Hey. The shellfish platter
on this one

19:46.118 --> 19:48.020
is like 10 Euro cheaper.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.289
Oh, great.
Cheap shellfish.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.723
Always the way to go.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.495
Ooh. Beginning to feel
a bit nauseous.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.464
I hope those clams
were okay.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.198
They were
a little sticky.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.467
You're probably just
feeling nauseous

20:00.467 --> 20:01.534
from being
such a tourist.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.370
I like music festivals.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.838
Because seldom
you get to see good things.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.974
But then you get to see
terrible things on and on,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.576
you know,
horrible things.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.811
Really bad th--
Unbearable things.
Look at that.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.681
The Andrew Walsh Ensemble
is playing tonight.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.815
What the fuck?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.150
I have a friend who
plays in that show.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.087
Perhaps we go?

20:21.087 --> 20:22.355
Okay.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.191
I wish our performance
was not at La Fenice.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.193
When the audience
is there--

20:27.193 --> 20:29.529
the critics--
it feels like a cage to me.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.398
Well, let's get
out of the cage.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.432
Let's do something
about this--

20:32.432 --> 20:33.500
Alessandra.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.137
Hey, hey, is this guy
bothering you?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.642
Maestro.
I will be seeing you.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.244
And you will be
hearing me.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.846
You don't know shit
about opera.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.581
And you don't know shit
about the universe.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.450
You know, dark matter.
We don't know about it.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.751
We do not know.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.053
We still have
a lot of things
to discover.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.588
Who's that guy?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.056
He's the head of
a very awful claque.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.591
They want money,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.627
or they'll boo you
during the performance.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.161
If they boo you
during the performance,

21:02.161 --> 21:03.730
I'll go down in the audience
and I'll kick him in the balls,

21:03.730 --> 21:04.864
you know, and I'll
make him a castrati.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.066
I have so many
new pieces to learn.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.535
And my voice,
I'm not prepared.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.337
- No.
- I can't give them
what they want.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.805
Wait, no, no, no.
Of course you can
give them what they--

21:12.805 --> 21:14.441
Don't think about
what they want.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.343
Don't do it for them.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.077
Do it for you.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.946
Do it for the blood.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.349
Or do it for me.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.553
She should sing
instead of me.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.625
Okay.
Why don't you--

21:32.625 --> 21:34.160
Why don't you
join her?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.496
- I can't.
- No, you can.
You can.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.897
I'm your maestro,
right?

21:39.098 --> 21:40.367
Now, woman.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.410
It's La Fiamma.

22:23.410 --> 22:27.079
Oh, my God.
Ti amo.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.114
Ti amo anche io.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.620
Grazie.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.522
Alessandra, yes.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.457
Bien, bien.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.692
Grazie. Grazie.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.660
Yes.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.830
I wanted to share this place,

22:43.830 --> 22:46.098
because it is
very dear to me.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.333
Che bello.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.802
- Bello, no?
- Si.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.738
It used to be
a nunnery.

22:51.738 --> 22:55.174
And I lived up there
in that room for two years.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.043
You were a nun?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.445
My ex wife is a nun.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.212
It is no longer
for nuns.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.717
It was for people who
could not stand to live
anywhere else.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.954
And I went there after
my failure on stage.

23:07.954 --> 23:08.921
You understand?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.458
Yes, I understand.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.025
Singing for me
was everything.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.828
And then I found
I could not sing.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.631
When I lived there,
I could not feed myself.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.934
I needed help to bathe,
to put on clothes,

23:21.934 --> 23:24.003
to go to the bathroom,
even.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.772
No one know this.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.140
No one except Beppi.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.309
He stuck with me.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.878
Now you.

23:31.878 --> 23:36.483
Tell me
something about you
that no one knows.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.785
But I'm nothing.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.588
I'm just some musical notes
that people play with.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.493
And actually,
I've been thinking
a lot about my mentor,

23:46.493 --> 23:47.727
Maestro Rivera.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.062
He's very old
and he's very ill.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.298
And he invited me
to go back to Mexico

23:52.298 --> 23:53.833
to take over
the orchestra.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.002
The one where I started.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.571
And I said no.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.906
And I went back to
New York

23:59.906 --> 24:02.542
to be with an orchestra
that doesn't play.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.977
Rodrigo,
stay con me.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.514
You must move into
my palazzo,

24:07.514 --> 24:10.049
so we may practice
night and day.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.285
Live and breathe
the music.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.187
Oh, la mami.
Yes.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.441
Sorry.
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.443
- Nice of you to join us.
- I got on the-- Sorry.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.311
I got on the wrong vaporetto.
And then--

24:39.311 --> 24:40.680
Well, you missed
the sound check.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.882
I know. I really don't
feel well right now, either.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.283
Well, neither do I,
because the fucking oboist,

24:44.283 --> 24:45.552
who I added to
the program

24:45.552 --> 24:46.986
because I believed in
her talent,

24:46.986 --> 24:50.222
turned out to be
a complete flake.

24:51.591 --> 24:54.026
- Ah, shock and awe.
- Shock and awe.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.728
Now, go, go.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.631
- Hey. Nice job, rookie.
- Thanks.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.657
- Clams?
- Yeah.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.825
Which one is your friend?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.860
She's the one
that plays the oboe.

25:40.472 --> 25:41.974
She's your lover.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.211
Hailai? No, no,
she-- she's my protegé.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.846
Very innocent.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.380
Do you like innocence?

25:48.380 --> 25:51.083
It appeals to
your depravity.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.720
It is not depravity.
She plays the oboe.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.047
Hey. I am so,
so sorry.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.114
I can play
the second half

26:22.114 --> 26:23.549
of the concert,
though, I think.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.885
I think you can't play
the second half.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.987
I think you're done
on this tour.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.489
I will definitely miss
the conducting lessons, though.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.992
Look, I'm really sorry,
I just didn't want to
barf on stage.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.027
So you ran off
during my solo.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.864
Oh, my God, your solo,
your solo, your solo.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.331
It's always about
your solo.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.834
- Yes, and why do you
think that is?
- Uh--

26:41.834 --> 26:44.070
Because it's the
Andrew Walsh Ensemble.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.405
The Andrew Walsh Ensemble,
that's what people pay for.

26:46.405 --> 26:50.142
Yes.
And we want our money back.

26:50.142 --> 26:50.977
Rodrigo?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.679
I came to see
his protegé.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.180
Oh, shit.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.414
Oh, my God,
it's-- it's--

26:55.414 --> 26:58.150
Yes. La Fiamma.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.085
What an honor.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.020
Did you catch any of
the first half?

27:01.020 --> 27:01.954
Yes.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.690
I saw you
sawing on the cello

27:03.690 --> 27:05.591
like you were
cutting down a tree.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.927
Yes, I'm a very
expressive player.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.395
- Always have been.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.697
I think I'm gonna be
sick again, I need to--

27:10.697 --> 27:11.864
You're still fired.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.132
- No, she quits.
- No, no, no, no.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.867
- Watch. She quits.
- I-- I really--

27:14.867 --> 27:16.368
- You quit, Hailai.
She quits.
- I need this job.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.370
- I really need this job.
- She quits.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.707
- She-- You quit!
- You want to
mix it up, Maestro?

27:20.707 --> 27:22.241
- You want to mix it up?
- Yeah, whenever.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.043
- Yeah?
- Yo-Yo Ma wanna be.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.712
- Yo-Yo Ma?
- Yeah.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.046
- Yo mama, Yo-Yo Ma.
- You know what?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.280
- What'd you say?
- I want to--

27:28.280 --> 27:29.916
Sometimes I have trouble
with your accent.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.718
Shh.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.285
Oh.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.023
Ciao. Ciao.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.500
Now what the fuck
am I gonna do?

27:58.610 --> 28:00.312
Hailey.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.181
Come with us.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.317
Yes, Hailai.
We'll take care of you.

28:05.317 --> 28:08.620
In my palazzo,
there are many rooms.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.756
Okay.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.607
Just don't throw up
in the taxi, okay?

28:28.607 --> 28:30.209
'Kay.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.878
But if you throw up,
you tell me. Okay?

28:31.878 --> 28:33.212
It's okay, it's okay.
