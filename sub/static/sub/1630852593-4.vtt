00:30.200 --> 00:32.840
<i>-Oh! Oh!</i>

00:32.920 --> 00:34.280
<i>-Gimme it.</i>
-<i>No need to swear.</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:38.040
<i>Give that to me.</i>
<i>You're such a menace with that thing!</i>

00:42.320 --> 00:44.840
Come on. Go on. Good girl.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.240
Come on. Good girl.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.840
-Ah!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.280
-Oh my God! Oh my God!
-Prat!

01:05.960 --> 01:09.200
Maybe life is still worth living.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.920
-Oh my God.
-That's not funny, actually. It could've--

01:12.000 --> 01:13.320
Wow. I disagree.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.080
-Tony, could you clear this up?
-No.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.400
Hurt my elbow as well.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.760
Fuck's sake, come on!

01:32.840 --> 01:35.040
I'm stretching.
I like to do things properly.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.400
Like wear whites for tennis.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.320
Just fucking give me the ball.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.680
Yeah, Tony, please watch
your language, okay?

01:45.960 --> 01:47.000
Fifteen-love.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.600
Ugh.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.760
Oh, come on, Matthew!

01:55.800 --> 01:56.720
Oh.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.960
-One-love.
-All right, change ends.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.200
-No, fuck that.
-What?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.120
That's what you do after the first game.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.320
To keep it fair. But the sun's in my eyes,
you daft cunt. The advantage is to you.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.200
Can you not keep saying
words like that here, please?

02:12.120 --> 02:13.960
-Fucking hell.
-All right, just…

02:22.840 --> 02:23.880
Oh.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.040
No! No!

02:35.480 --> 02:37.040
Ow! No, you don't.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.080
Oh!

02:38.160 --> 02:39.120
Grow up.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.240
Oh!

02:42.320 --> 02:44.080
-Oh.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.000
Unlucky.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.760
Good game.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.360
-I mean, look at you.
-What?

02:51.440 --> 02:53.160
-It's a piss-take, mate.
-What is?

02:53.240 --> 02:55.120
-You look like Maradona.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.200
Not in the '80's. In the--

02:58.120 --> 02:59.320
Right before he died.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.080
-After he died.
-Don't get nasty.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.720
Who won?

03:08.760 --> 03:09.720
He did, but--

03:09.800 --> 03:11.120
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.360
Obviously I can never go back there again.
The language was appalling.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.680
Effing and jeffing all over. He'd have
been disqualified from Wimbledon.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.960
-Fucking Wimbledon.
-See what I mean?

03:20.040 --> 03:23.080
That's nothing. He shouted at a bloke
with a baby in the cafe the other day,

03:23.160 --> 03:24.960
everyone looking, calling him a cunt.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.520
For very good reason.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.160
-Why?
-He was a cunt.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.440
Ugh. Could never use that word.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.160
Shows lack of vocabulary. If a bloke
uses that word, I go right off him.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.840
What if he's calling Hitler a cunt?

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
Straight to Hitler.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.080
It doesn't bother you, does it?

03:40.160 --> 03:43.520
No, it don't bother me, but I wouldn't use
it around a lady if she didn't like it.

03:44.120 --> 03:48.200
So I've either got to stop using it
around you or get you to enjoy it.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.920
I'll get you to use it brilliantly.
It'll change your life. Trust me.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.160
-You will <i>never </i>hear me use that word.
-We'll see.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.480
Talking of vocabulary,
I've got a date with a teacher, so--

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
Good. What does he teach?

04:02.280 --> 04:03.120
Dunno. Why?

04:03.760 --> 04:08.640
Well, if it's science, I probably wouldn't
go on about ghosts and horoscopes.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.480
Why? That's science too.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.880
No, it's not.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.960
It's the opposite. Trust me.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.960
There she is.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.920
You all right? Here's one.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.520
-Why did the chicken cross the road?
-Dunno.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.360
To get away from the smell of two gypsies
fucking my wife.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.800
8:00 in the morning that was,
back of Safeway.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.040
Disgusting.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.640
Why do you always say stuff like that
to me? They're not even proper jokes.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.720
Hmm, comedy critic now, are we?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.000
Also, it's racist.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.760
Shut up! Why?

04:41.400 --> 04:44.840
-"The smell of 2 gypsies fucking my wife?"
-The smell was coming from her!

04:44.920 --> 04:48.280
Use your noggin. She had
a terrible feminine hygiene problem.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.120
Do you want me to spell it out for you?
I had to bloody live with it.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.400
The two lads, good as gold. Clean
as you like, Danny Richards and Sid Nash.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.040
Lovely pair of boys.
She was the one that stank.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.720
I said, "You've got a proper odor going on
in that big old cabbage of yours."

05:01.800 --> 05:03.160
She didn't bloody care.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.640
She'd say, "Oh, if God had wanted
my snatch to smell nice,

05:06.720 --> 05:08.560
he wouldn't put it next to me arsehole."

05:08.640 --> 05:12.680
I know, you're thinking, "Oh, that's
a good point, Brian." No, it isn't.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.440
Her arsehole wasn't a problem. Go figure.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.640
Hmm.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.800
Wow. Morning, gang.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.400
All right, Brian, um,

05:22.560 --> 05:23.640
can you do me a favor?

05:23.720 --> 05:24.680
Depends.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.080
My postman is proper depressed
at the moment.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.000
He's feeling very low about his life.

05:31.080 --> 05:36.320
And I thought if he spoke to someone
with a genuinely awful existence,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.400
it might make him feel better
about his own situation.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.040
-Not a problem. Leave it with me.
-Cheers.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.520
I'll have some tea. Tea time.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.760
Right. Squash.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.720
-What?
-Squash.

05:48.800 --> 05:54.200
Oh, uh, no need. I've proved my point,
and you're right. I feel less aggressive.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.560
-Oh, chicken?
-No.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.200
Well, sounds like you're chicken.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.880
-No.
-Is squash too much for you?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.240
-No.
-You played before?

06:00.320 --> 06:02.440
Not this century,
but that won't be a problem.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.200
Oh, great. Won't be a problem. Great.
Yeah, see you on court.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.080
He's never gonna win at anything.
I'm never gonna let that happen.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.840
Whatever I have to do, I will make sure--

06:12.920 --> 06:14.720
Look at him. He's so wired.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.400
He can't stand it.
He can't believe I've beaten him.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.520
So you were childhood sweethearts
and, uh, then you lost touch?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.680
Yes. We met in 1957.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.080
I was 16 and Bill was 17.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.960
I was working at the factory.
Bill was working as a groundsman.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.200
And we went together for a year or so,
and we split up.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.320
-Do you remember why?
-Don't remember what I had for breakfast!

06:46.400 --> 06:49.520
He drank too much. Always drunk.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.480
-I don't drink now.
-I do.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.760
-So anyway, we sort of lost touch.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.840
We met other people,
both got married, and that was that.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.840
I think we bumped into each other
a couple of times over the years.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.160
So when we found out
we'd both been widowed,

07:04.240 --> 07:08.040
we had a cup of tea,
and we hit it off again.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.680
You never lose that spark.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.800
We weren't gonna bother getting married,

07:11.880 --> 07:15.120
but I'm Catholic, and I started
feeling guilty about the sex.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.040
Sex.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.760
-Okay. Um, when is the wedding?
-Uh--

07:20.840 --> 07:23.200
-August 28th.
-28th.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.920
-I'm getting married in August.
-Fool.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.920
Well, congratulations. I hope
you have many wonderful years together.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.640
Hopefully, I go first this time.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.040
Hopefully in time
for me to find someone else!

07:37.840 --> 07:38.680
Take a picture.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.280
Smile.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.320
Great.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.240
Did I hug Lisa enough?

07:56.040 --> 07:59.880
Are you joking? I never met
a couple more devoted to each other.

07:59.960 --> 08:04.320
No, I know she knew I loved her,
but did I actually say it out loud?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.800
Did I remind her all the time?

08:05.880 --> 08:09.880
Yeah, you did. It was obvious
to everyone around, let alone her.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.240
You're a good mate.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.000
I'm just being honest.
It's what I want too.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.080
Meeting June's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.040
Believe it or not,
I'm not as in demand as you might think.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.040
-You're a fine catch.
-Hug?

08:24.120 --> 08:27.600
-No, get away from me, you sweaty mollusk.
-You just said I was a fine catch.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.720
Yeah, but I meant like
in one of those deep sea fishing shows

08:30.800 --> 08:33.000
where they pull summat up from the bottom.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.880
They thought it was extinct.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.960
They don't even know what it is. It's just
a blob. It could be a fish or a slug.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.800
Back to normal, then.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.000
-Nothing will ever be back to normal.
-Oh, shit. Why did I say that?

08:46.920 --> 08:49.880
Normal used to be us getting drunk
and you sleeping on the couch.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.520
Let's have a drink tonight.
Nothing big. I'll make it home.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.160
Yeah, all right.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.760
Hey, boy.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.760
-All right?
-You all right?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.280
-Yeah.
-How's it going?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.240
-All right, yeah.
-Yeah?

09:19.840 --> 09:20.800
Nice day, innit?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.240
-Heard you're feeling a bit down.
-Yeah.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.760
Yeah. Talk to me.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.600
Well, everyone knows
what Roxy does for a living.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.760
-I'm just embarrassed.
-Embarrassed?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.760
I'm probably delivering to blokes
that have actually shagged her.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.600
At the very least.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.680
-What do you mean?
-I doubt it's just a straightforward shag.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.120
Get my drift?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.760
Think about it, boy.
Imagine all the things she has to do.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.800
Missionary, missionary, missionary,
missionary, missionary. Boring.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.560
"Turn round. Let me see that ass."

09:55.280 --> 09:56.160
Bored of that.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.960
"Swivel round. Get your mouth
around my naughty lolly."

09:59.040 --> 10:01.800
"Watch those gnashers! Keep it gums."

10:03.040 --> 10:05.080
"Lovely. There you go. Take the money."

10:05.160 --> 10:07.280
"Now, go back to your postman boyfriend."

10:10.400 --> 10:11.240
Know what I mean?

10:13.640 --> 10:15.920
Listen, at least she gets paid for it.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.520
Huh? My wife used to give it away.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.520
Sometimes behind my back.
Sometimes she'd make me film it.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.120
How's that make me feel? I'm filming it.
Looking through-- How's that make me feel?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.200
Worthless.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.760
Like a slug feeding on bird shit,

10:28.840 --> 10:31.000
in the rain, only to be trodden on

10:32.200 --> 10:33.400
and left to die in agony.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.360
What I'm trying to say is
don't be a worthless slug like me.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.200
Be a man.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.200
See you soon.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.560
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.880
You're my son.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.440
Yep.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.960
How are you, Dad?

10:59.040 --> 11:00.680
Uh, mustn't grumble.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.200
And where have you been?

11:04.120 --> 11:04.960
Australia.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.520
Oh. Where's that?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.840
You know, if you come out here
and turn left,

11:11.640 --> 11:13.440
it's about 10,000 miles.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.720
Oh, right.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.720
You're back now though, yeah?

11:17.480 --> 11:18.680
-Yeah.
-For good?

11:20.160 --> 11:21.280
-Yep.
-Hello.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.720
-Hello.
-Hi.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.280
I was just, you know…

11:26.160 --> 11:27.000
Hanging.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.800
You should bring me, um, chess set.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.360
Give you a game.
You were pretty good when you were young.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.160
-Was I?
-Yeah.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.080
Where is it?

11:39.920 --> 11:43.160
Sideboard, with the sherry.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.920
-I'll bring it in tomorrow.
-Thanks.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.520
I'd better go actually. I was just--

11:49.600 --> 11:52.800
Well, I can take a quick break
and walk with you if you like?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, sure.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.080
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
What are you doing?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.600
Friends hold hands.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.880
-Do they?
-Yeah.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.760
-Some men even hold hands.
-Gay men.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.160
No, straight men hold hands too sometimes.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.160
What straight men
walk along the street holding hands?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.680
In Spain, and they're not gay.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.240
Well, some are.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.840
-Not many. Very macho. Bullfighters.
-Right.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.320
Bullfighters aren't gay.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.360
No. In their little berets
and their sequinned tights,

12:32.440 --> 12:34.720
dancing around
having roses thrown at them.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.240
-Definitely not gay.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.640
Sadistic cunts.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.720
But not gay. Where are we going?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.560
-<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>-Daffodil.</i>

13:04.080 --> 13:05.520
<i>Yeah. Criminal damage.</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:09.680
<i>Fuck. I was picking it for you,</i>
<i>you miserable sod!</i>

13:14.720 --> 13:16.160
Right, come on, then.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.840
So as some of you might know,

13:18.920 --> 13:23.040
it is the 500-year anniversary
of the Tambury Fair

13:23.120 --> 13:24.960
and muggins here has been asked

13:25.040 --> 13:27.640
to make sure the Tambury Players
provide a bit of culture.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.960
Now, I've roped in Coleen.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.760
She's gonna be covering
the behind-the-scenes organizing,

13:32.840 --> 13:35.760
and also she's gonna be doing
a big feature on us.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.720
Ooh.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.280
Typical of me
to get us in the spotlight, isn't it?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.400
So, come on, then. What are we gonna do?
We need some ideas. Ooh.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.960
-Any thoughts? Something historical.
-<i>Les Misérables.</i>

13:46.040 --> 13:49.240
<i>Les Misérables </i>did happen in the past.
We can't really do that though, can we?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.000
I'm not paying for that. Fuck that.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.960
I got done with that for <i>Evita.</i>

13:53.520 --> 13:54.960
Still paying that off.

13:55.040 --> 13:59.040
No, we need something interactive,
you know, where you can walk around.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.720
A bit promenade.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.600
People coming up to you. A viking
coming up, you know, raping and pillaging.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
Not actually.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.680
A monk coming up to you, blessing you.
Stuff from the past!

14:08.760 --> 14:12.440
A pirate ship. I don't know.
A pig! Just a pig running around.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.200
Is that a good idea? I don't know.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.400
Come on! It can't just be me.
What other ideas have we got?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.560
I can be
an out-of-work Shakespearean actor.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.880
Oh, don't start, James.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.840
We're all just having fun, okay? We've all
given up our own time to be here.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.880
Yeah, but you don't have
to deliver papers, do you?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.800
Well, nor do you. You dump most of 'em.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.600
Look, things aren't going well for me
at the minute and--

14:36.680 --> 14:38.880
They've never gone well for you, James.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.160
What about me?
I backed the wrong horse with you.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.080
Now, look, I'm a bit worried about him

14:43.160 --> 14:46.320
because without performing,
he's got absolutely nothing going for him.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.160
Yeah, this is performing.
What more do you want?

14:49.240 --> 14:51.240
But it's just amateur, isn't it?
It's all amateur!

14:51.320 --> 14:54.360
Amateur? Amateur? Don't you dare.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.360
I'm a professional actor and director,
I'll have you know.

14:57.440 --> 15:02.120
-What you been in?
-<i>Taxi Driver</i>, the musical, Wigan.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.640
Any good?

15:03.720 --> 15:05.160
Oh, well, you tell me.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.640
Bang, bang!

15:17.840 --> 15:18.680
Bang, bang!

15:26.440 --> 15:27.360
Taxi!

15:31.280 --> 15:32.400
He's good.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.360
-People don't often click the waiter now.
-Can I give you the wine list?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.960
I think it's
"May I give you the wine list?"

15:58.040 --> 15:59.760
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.440
Do you know about wine?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.600
Um, not really. I like prosecco.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.360
-Shall I order?
-Yeah.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.520
<i>May</i> we have a couple of glasses

16:12.600 --> 16:16.880
of Chianti Classico 2017, I think, please?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.880
-And then we'll take it from there.
-Which one's that?

16:21.200 --> 16:25.840
I can't be much more specific
than the Chianti Classico 2017,

16:25.920 --> 16:28.200
which is written down there
in black and white.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.760
-Right.
-Be knowledgeable about your job.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.040
If your heart's not in it,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.520
I'm on minimum wage, mate.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.680
Work harder at school, mate.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.600
Off he goes, tail between his legs.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.240
So you work in--

16:45.320 --> 16:48.920
Elbows off the table.
You work in the newspaper industry?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.440
-Yeah. Yeah.
-For a newspaper?

16:50.520 --> 16:51.480
Huh.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.440
-Yeah.
-Um,

16:55.240 --> 16:56.800
I only really read <i>The Guardian.</i>

16:58.000 --> 17:01.080
And occasionally <i>Private Eye,</i>
but even then I'm off on a tangent.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.840
I have got
what I like to call a creative brain.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.400
I write poetry.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.600
Do you like poetry?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.080
-Yeah.
-Yes.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.000
-Do you?
-Yeah.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.400
'Cause a lot of people say
they like poetry,

17:18.480 --> 17:22.120
but what they actually mean
is they like <i>If</i> by Rudyard Kipling,

17:22.200 --> 17:25.400
and they think that is
in some way high art.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.080
Like people who say they play-- Elbows.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.000
Like people who say they play chess

17:30.080 --> 17:33.720
when what they actually mean is they know
how the pieces are allowed to move.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.000
Do you like chess?

17:38.080 --> 17:41.360
-I don't-- don't play it.
-You don't play it. There we are.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.360
-But you know how the pieces move?
-I know some of the pieces.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.280
There we are.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.720
-Some.
-Pardon?

17:49.160 --> 17:51.520
In chess, there's a horse. A little horse.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.920
There's a knight.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.720
-And a-- a prawn?
-A pawn.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.840
I play draughts.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.440
Draughts is easier, isn't it?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.960
Draughts is a very simple game.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.160
There you go.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.840
This is one of your five a day.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.960
-Grapes.
-Yeah, exactly.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.920
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.200
Ah.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.200
-You all right?
-Yeah, good. Are you all right?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.960
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.280
-All right.
-Feel free to say no. It's not a big deal.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.760
But I was wondering
if you'd be my best man at the wedding.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.720
Oh, fuck.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.920
Am I really the best man though?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.240
-You're the only man, to be honest.
-Right.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.440
Okay.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.400
I mean, I've gotta say yes, haven't I?

18:58.440 --> 18:59.560
If I'm still alive.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.200
-You're not still talking like that?
-No, I mean,

19:03.280 --> 19:06.040
I eat and drink too much.
I might not make it till August.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.280
Okay, as long as you die
of natural causes, that's all right.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.720
That's what I'm hoping for now.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.440
Rather than be a best man at a wedding,
I choose death.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.480
I mean, I'm flattered. Fucking hell.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.160
Have I gotta stay sober?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.960
Maybe up until the speech.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.600
Let's do the speech before the ceremony.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.800
Right. Okay.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.920
Knock it out. Let's do…

19:37.360 --> 19:38.240
Um,

19:39.360 --> 19:41.320
do you teach science?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.240
Nope.

19:42.840 --> 19:49.320
I work in the arts side of teaching.
I teach English.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.680
-Language and lit, together at last.
-Oh, good.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.080
-Um, I like horoscopes and that.
-Pardon me?

19:56.600 --> 19:57.960
I like horo--

19:58.040 --> 19:59.320
-Horoscopes?
-Yeah.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.400
-Do you?
-Do I like horoscopes?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.920
-Yeah.
-No. Of course not.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.320
Claptrap, twaddle.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.240
Wishful thinking

20:13.960 --> 20:16.040
for the gullible and the desperate.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.000
No offense.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.040
Sit up.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.440
Shoulders back.
Elbows off the table, always.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.760
-You looking forward to it? Married life?
-Definitely.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.640
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure, I'm giving up playing the field,

20:34.480 --> 20:36.480
but the, uh, pros outweigh the cons.

20:37.120 --> 20:37.960
Good.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.800
For example, I used to sit up all night
watching telly, eating.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.000
Now I still do that,

20:44.080 --> 20:47.280
but I don't have to get up
to get food anymore. She brings it to me.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.560
-Brilliant.
-Have to watch a bit of girly telly.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
Like what?

20:52.600 --> 20:55.640
<i>The Crown, Fleabag,</i>
<i>Great British Bake Off.</i>

20:55.720 --> 20:57.800
But if I see a cake I like

20:57.880 --> 21:00.960
and I say, "Ooh, that looks good,"
I know I'll be eating it the next day.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.600
So <i>Great British Bake Off</i>
is like the Shopping Channel for you now?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.680
-Yeah.
-Amazing. What a life.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.280
Two forward, one to the side.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.200
Elbows.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.320
Thank you.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.480
-I'll get this.
-Great.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.920
Then you pay the tip.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.200
-How much is it?
-£38.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.480
-Right.
-So 15%.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.880
Which is?

21:30.760 --> 21:32.720
Well, what is 10% of 38?

21:35.440 --> 21:36.520
£3.80.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
£3.80, she's got it.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.480
Then plus 50% would be?

21:41.160 --> 21:42.280
I'll just leave a fiver.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.360
That's not enough, is it?

21:45.160 --> 21:46.880
-I'll leave a tenner.
-Way too much.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.920
-I'm a big tipper, all right?
-All right.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.280
Now then, what have we got here?

21:51.960 --> 21:55.440
HSBC. Advanced UK debit.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.520
Mustache!

21:58.640 --> 22:00.080
Oh, Mustache?

22:07.240 --> 22:09.840
-Uh, you seem happier recently.
-Do I?

22:11.360 --> 22:12.200
Yeah.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.040
I'm just trying to get on with it,
you know.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.360
I certainly wanna get better, you know.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.200
I wanna be a good person.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.720
But sometimes,

22:23.680 --> 22:25.040
I just can't be bothered.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.040
It's too hard.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.920
We talk a good talk,
but when it comes to it,

22:31.000 --> 22:35.440
we sort of run and hide
from, you know, real sacrifice. Like,

22:36.240 --> 22:37.960
would I give my kidney to a stranger?

22:38.040 --> 22:40.400
No. Definitely not.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.840
I wouldn't give it to <i>you.</i>
But some people do.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.800
How are they that good?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.800
I mean, that's incredible,

22:47.880 --> 22:51.200
and I wanna do something good, you know?

22:51.280 --> 22:53.240
I wanna make a sacrifice. I wanna

22:53.960 --> 22:55.480
make a difference,

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
but then I think,

22:58.240 --> 22:59.360
"What's the point?"

22:59.880 --> 23:01.720
So I give my kidney to someone,

23:02.760 --> 23:05.320
but they're gonna die anyway one day, so

23:06.320 --> 23:07.400
who cares?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.960
When I see kids playing now,
I don't think,

23:10.040 --> 23:12.120
"Oh, look. They've got
their whole lives ahead of 'em."

23:12.200 --> 23:15.680
I think, "They'll all be dead one day,
so all this is pointless."

23:15.760 --> 23:18.760
-Will you let me edit the best man speech?

23:20.560 --> 23:23.680
But I guess what I'm saying is
I don't care about death anymore.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.280
You know,
I don't mean I wanna die.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.480
I mean whatever.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.760
I'm not angry anymore.
I don't want to punish the world.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.000
I've had my life,
and now there's nothing more to add.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.400
And it annoys me that people think
I can have that again with someone else.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.440
Like I can replace Lisa. I can't.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.160
And I'm cool with that

23:42.680 --> 23:47.200
because it makes my time with her
even more beautiful, even more precious.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.560
And everything I've got now
is because of her.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.680
She paid off the mortgage on the house.
She took out life insurance.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.720
I've got 150 grand, and I haven't--

23:58.640 --> 23:59.720
I haven't collected it.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.880
You've got 150 grand?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.440
Yeah, I haven't cashed the check,

24:05.160 --> 24:07.080
because I don't want it.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.120
'Cause of

24:10.160 --> 24:11.040
how I got it.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.600
Tony, please tell me you'll cash it,

24:14.680 --> 24:17.880
even if it's only to take it
off a fucking insurance company.
