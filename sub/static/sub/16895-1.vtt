Do you really think I am that shallow?

All right, yes, I am a little shallow.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.821
But I am deep enough to admit it.
I'm much deeper than people think, Ray.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.532
And I am only shallow
because I choose to be!

of a mix-up.

before the city slaps me with more citations.

You could get these so-called local poets
to come to your class.

we could discuss rhythm and meter...

Some people don't value words
as much as I do.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.956
Some people don't put stock in them...

31:15.123 --> 31:18.334
...and they can be casually cruel
with them.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.462
Some people can be very cruel.

But I'd like to think
most people are better than that.

a line of baked goods...

"Phenomenal Woman," for example.

Or a raisin loaf with Robert Frost's
"The Road Not Taken" swirled in.

is very normal.

is to acknowledge it, validate it...
