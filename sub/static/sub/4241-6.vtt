00:01.296 --> 00:03.197
<i>So here's what you missed on
Glee. Puck tried to steal an ATM</i>

00:03.265 --> 00:05.215
<i>and got himself stuck in juvie. As
far as badasses go, I'm number one.</i>

00:05.283 --> 00:06.834
<i>Sam and Quinn are sort of a couple,</i>

00:06.885 --> 00:07.835
<i>and so are Mike and Tina.</i>

00:07.886 --> 00:08.752
<i>Artie and Brittany went out,</i>

00:08.837 --> 00:10.054
<i>but then he sort of dumped her,</i>

00:10.138 --> 00:10.871
<i>and now he sort of wants her back.</i>

00:10.922 --> 00:12.740
<i>Kurt's pretty lonely</i>

00:12.807 --> 00:14.058
<i>all by himself, and so is Coach Beiste.</i>

00:14.142 --> 00:15.375
<i>Sue keeps trying to get her to quit.</i>

00:16.227 --> 00:17.544
<i>Are those dog poop cookies?</i>

00:17.596 --> 00:18.896
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:29.789 --> 00:31.373
Phew.

00:31.458 --> 00:33.292
Ooh. Dude.

00:33.343 --> 00:35.344
How do you stand that cold tub?

00:35.428 --> 00:37.546
I'm used to cold showers dating Quinn.

00:44.721 --> 00:46.855
No.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.140
How about a little something-something?

00:48.208 --> 00:49.275
A little something-something

00:49.342 --> 00:50.809
always leads to something more.

00:50.877 --> 00:52.177
I've been there, remember?

00:52.245 --> 00:54.647
When we're prom king
and queen, it will feel

00:54.698 --> 00:58.183
just as good as a little
something-something.

00:58.235 --> 00:59.735
Been there, dude.

00:59.803 --> 01:02.054
Actually, still there now, but

01:02.122 --> 01:04.072
how did we find the only two girls

01:04.157 --> 01:05.691
in high school that won't put out?

01:05.742 --> 01:08.193
What do you do, though?

01:08.245 --> 01:10.246
Well, easy.

01:10.330 --> 01:14.066
I just think about the
opposite of what I'm doing.

01:23.643 --> 01:25.427
(grunts) (screaming) Oh, my God!

01:29.749 --> 01:33.519
I've never actually almost
killed a civil servant before.

01:33.586 --> 01:37.056
Well, you have to find something
to be your own buzz kill.

01:37.123 --> 01:40.009
You know, something
that is total not hot.

01:40.076 --> 01:41.493
BEISTE: I don't care!

01:41.561 --> 01:44.246
If you're on this football team,

01:44.331 --> 01:45.364
you'll wear a cup, no exceptions!

01:45.415 --> 01:46.582
Hey, have you ever noticed

01:46.666 --> 01:47.750
that when the Beiste gets all fired up,

01:47.834 --> 01:48.968
her underpants go right up her butt?

01:49.035 --> 01:50.452
...in your groin with that helmet?

01:50.537 --> 01:53.772
<i>You think The Nutcracker's
just a musical?</i>

01:53.840 --> 01:57.042
Looks like I've found
my mailman. Yes, you did.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.611

02:02.716 --> 02:04.967
I take it we have a
lot of sweater trains

02:05.051 --> 02:06.852
to look forward to this season.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.141
Are you okay?

02:12.225 --> 02:14.926
Yeah. Fine.

02:14.978 --> 02:16.812
(school bell ringing)

02:19.232 --> 02:22.451
All right, guys, let's
get down to business.

02:22.535 --> 02:25.487
First, let's welcome
back Noah Puckerman.

02:25.572 --> 02:27.156
(applause)

02:27.240 --> 02:28.774
Puck, I hope your time in juvie

02:28.825 --> 02:31.126
has taught you a lesson or
two about right and wrong.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.128
Are you kidding me? I ruled that place.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.664
All I did was crack skulls
and lift weights all day.

02:35.732 --> 02:36.732
QUINN: Wow, what a catch.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.750
Can't believe I ever let you go.

02:37.801 --> 02:39.551
And now, drum roll, Finn.

02:39.619 --> 02:41.837
Because I have in my hand

02:41.921 --> 02:44.423
our competition for
Sectionals next month.

02:44.474 --> 02:45.457
(applause and cheering)

02:45.508 --> 02:47.226
First, the a capella choir

02:47.293 --> 02:49.144
from the all-boys' private
school in Westerville,

02:49.229 --> 02:50.979
the Dalton Academy Warblers.

02:51.064 --> 02:52.348
(cheering)

02:52.432 --> 02:53.932
Okay, hold up.

02:53.983 --> 02:56.468
Like, a million awesome gay
jokes just popped into my head.

02:56.519 --> 02:57.870
And the other
team to beat--

02:57.937 --> 02:59.671
The Hipsters,

02:59.739 --> 03:01.156
a first-year club

03:01.241 --> 03:03.642
from the Warren Township
Continuing Education Program.

03:03.693 --> 03:04.993
Now, they are a glee club

03:05.078 --> 03:07.112
composed entirely of elderly people

03:07.163 --> 03:09.531
getting their high school
GEDs. Is that legal?

03:09.616 --> 03:10.566
How are we supposed to compete against

03:10.633 --> 03:11.817
a bunch of adorable old people?

03:11.868 --> 03:13.335
Are you kidding? Brittle bones.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.671
Give one of those old ladies
a good-luck pat on the rear,

03:15.755 --> 03:16.889
it'll shatter her pelvis.

03:16.956 --> 03:18.841
WILL: Moving on. Since it seemed

03:18.925 --> 03:21.043
to get you guys jazzed
about Sectionals last year,

03:21.127 --> 03:22.828
I want to make this week

03:22.879 --> 03:25.163
our second annual Boys
Versus Girls tournament.

03:25.215 --> 03:27.633
(cheering and whooping) Yes!

03:27.684 --> 03:29.518
So, split up into two groups,

03:29.602 --> 03:31.837
and figure out what songs
you're going to sing.

03:31.888 --> 03:35.641
Great. Okay, I have
mash-up ideas in my head.

03:35.692 --> 03:39.344
Kurt, gonna say it
again-- boys' team.

03:39.396 --> 03:41.146
MERCEDES: Okay, how about y'all...?

03:41.197 --> 03:43.031
SAM: I say we do a whole AC/DC.

03:43.116 --> 03:44.533
Like, the lead guitarist,

03:44.617 --> 03:46.785
like, drops his pants at every concert.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.019
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:48.071 --> 03:49.521
Pants here...

03:49.572 --> 03:50.656
(school bell ringing)

03:50.707 --> 03:52.875
I know it's not my place to ask,

03:52.959 --> 03:55.193
but can you push me
down the back staircase?

03:55.245 --> 03:58.130
My injuries should be the same,
but it's more lightly populated,

03:58.197 --> 04:00.082
so the humiliation won't be as bad.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.834
Relax. I'm here to take care of you.

04:01.885 --> 04:03.252
You're my boy now. I don't understand.

04:03.336 --> 04:04.670
I got out of juvie early

04:04.721 --> 04:06.204
because I agreed to
do community service,

04:06.256 --> 04:08.006
but I ain't pickin' up
trash along the freeway.

04:08.057 --> 04:09.207
That's ghetto.

04:09.259 --> 04:11.093
So I told my probie officer that I knew

04:11.177 --> 04:13.395
a cripple that needed
some help. She went for it.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.646
I'm your community service?

04:14.714 --> 04:16.231
There's no way I'm going back to juvie.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.684
There's no chicks and no kosher
meal options up in that place.

04:18.735 --> 04:19.851
Cool. So we're, like, friends.

04:19.903 --> 04:21.269
Oh, slow down, Professor X.

04:21.353 --> 04:23.555
I never said anything about liking you.

04:23.606 --> 04:24.890
Now shut up right quick.

04:24.941 --> 04:26.224
We're going to steal some food

04:26.276 --> 04:27.409
from the cafeteria.

04:27.494 --> 04:29.561
This chair's a great
place for hiding stuff.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.865
What is your problem?!

04:32.916 --> 04:34.700
You talking back to me?

04:34.751 --> 04:36.835
You want a piece of The Fury?

04:36.903 --> 04:38.620
The Fury? That's what I named my fist.

04:38.705 --> 04:40.622
Well, with that level of
creativity, you could easily

04:40.707 --> 04:42.073
become assistant manager
at a rendering plant.

04:42.125 --> 04:45.093
I don't know what that is,
but if I find out it's bad,

04:45.178 --> 04:46.578
The Fury's going to find you.

04:46.629 --> 04:47.629
(slamming)

04:52.084 --> 04:53.802
(school bell ringing)

04:53.887 --> 04:55.888
Is there anything that I could do?

04:58.391 --> 05:00.192
(sighing): No.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.227
This is my hill to climb alone.

05:02.278 --> 05:04.980
Can I be honest?

05:05.048 --> 05:07.332
I think it's getting to you.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.435
Usually this stuff rolls
right off your back,

05:10.503 --> 05:11.987
but lately, you've been belligerent,

05:12.071 --> 05:13.405
angry, pushing people away.

05:13.456 --> 05:15.908
Can I be honest with you?

05:15.959 --> 05:17.659
You, like everyone else at this school,

05:17.744 --> 05:19.378
are too quick to let homophobia slide.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.064
And your lesson plans
are boring and repetitive.

05:22.131 --> 05:23.832
Boys Versus Girls?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.334
That doesn't challenge any of us.

05:25.401 --> 05:26.418
You mean, because I didn't let you

05:26.486 --> 05:27.719
join the girls like you wanted?

05:27.787 --> 05:31.390
To answer your question,
yes, I'm unhappy.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.008
And yes, being the only

05:33.092 --> 05:35.460
out gay kid at this school gets me down,

05:35.512 --> 05:37.563
but most of all,

05:37.630 --> 05:39.798
I'm not challenged in the least here.

05:39.849 --> 05:42.401
(school bell ringing)

05:42.468 --> 05:45.354
<i>WILL: Look, I'm not tossing the
baby out with the bathwater here.</i>

05:45.438 --> 05:46.605
I've totally done that.

05:46.656 --> 05:49.157
We're just making an adjustment.

05:49.242 --> 05:50.776
Boys, you are now doing songs

05:50.827 --> 05:52.027
traditionally sung by girl groups.

05:52.111 --> 05:55.113
And girls, try
some classic rock--

05:55.164 --> 05:56.798
uh, the Who, the Stones.

05:56.866 --> 05:59.284
The more opposite your choice,
the more points you get.

05:59.335 --> 06:00.452
Don't worry, gentlemen.

06:00.503 --> 06:02.004
I have this one under control.

06:02.088 --> 06:04.823
Now, obviously, for this medley to work,

06:04.874 --> 06:06.758
I'm going to have to sing lead,

06:06.826 --> 06:08.877
and, of course, when
you're singing Diana Ross,

06:08.962 --> 06:11.947
Bob Mackie-esque maribou
feather boas are a must.

06:12.015 --> 06:14.099
Isn't this lesson about opposites?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.351
I mean, you in a sequined
gown and a feather boa

06:16.419 --> 06:17.536
is exactly what you'd expect.

06:17.604 --> 06:18.837
Okay, who said anything about a gown?

06:18.905 --> 06:20.872
Uh, dude, why don't you
make yourself useful,

06:20.940 --> 06:23.775
and go put some rat poison
in the old folks' Jell-O,

06:23.843 --> 06:25.477
or visit the garglers? The Warblers.

06:25.528 --> 06:26.645
Whatever. See what they're up to.

06:26.696 --> 06:28.146
And you can wear all
the feathers you want.

06:28.197 --> 06:29.180
You'll blend right in.

06:32.118 --> 06:33.852
(sighs) Fine.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.551
(whispering): Is this
hot enough for you?

06:55.742 --> 06:57.092
(puckers lips)

07:03.433 --> 07:04.883
(softly): Say my name, Sam.

07:04.934 --> 07:07.235
I said, say my name.

07:08.855 --> 07:10.155
(door slamming)

07:10.222 --> 07:12.524
I said, say my name.

07:12.575 --> 07:15.027
Beiste.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.229
(mumbles)

07:18.281 --> 07:20.032
Are you okay?

07:20.099 --> 07:21.399
Yeah.

07:21.451 --> 07:23.418
I could do this for hours.

07:28.202 --> 07:29.602
I know what I heard.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.737
There we were, making out,
and he said it: "Beiste."

07:31.788 --> 07:33.656
I think he was picturing
making out with her.

07:33.724 --> 07:37.193
That is the most horrific
image I can imagine.

07:37.261 --> 07:38.444
Coach, I need help.

07:38.495 --> 07:39.745
I've done everything I can

07:39.796 --> 07:40.913
to rehabilitate my image.

07:40.981 --> 07:42.114
I'm getting straight A's,

07:42.165 --> 07:43.833
dating the cutest guy at school.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.985
Who would rather be
dry-humping She-Hulk.

07:46.053 --> 07:47.603
Oh, dear God, why did I say that?

07:47.671 --> 07:48.921
Now that's what I'm picturing.

07:48.972 --> 07:50.089
Do you know what kind
of disgusting images

07:50.140 --> 07:51.274
I'm going to have to look at

07:51.341 --> 07:52.892
to get this out of my head?

07:52.959 --> 07:54.860
I'm gonna have to go straight
to the wound care center.

07:54.928 --> 07:56.195
I'm gonna have to stare at some wounds.

07:56.263 --> 07:58.447
Coach, I really don't know what to do.

07:58.515 --> 08:00.733
Wait.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.185
This may be the opportunity
I've been waiting for.

08:03.270 --> 08:05.571
A way to get Beiste out of this school

08:05.639 --> 08:07.657
and your Macaulay Culkin

08:07.724 --> 08:09.191
stunt double back in your arms.

08:09.276 --> 08:10.826
What do I have to do?

08:10.911 --> 08:12.811
We need to go public with your pain.

08:12.863 --> 08:14.830
Get people talking about this,

08:14.915 --> 08:16.582
make Beiste into the
next Mary Kay Letourneau.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.918
And you need to give
him a piece of your mind.

08:18.985 --> 08:21.771
Loud and in public.

08:21.838 --> 08:23.122
Show him who's the boss.

08:23.173 --> 08:24.323
Oh, man.

08:24.374 --> 08:26.208
Now I'm picturing the two of them

08:26.293 --> 08:28.461
<i>making out during an
episode of Who's the Boss?</i>

08:28.512 --> 08:31.430
(school bell ringing)

08:31.498 --> 08:33.164
Shouldn't you be studying geometry?

08:33.216 --> 08:35.183
Aren't you failing?

08:35.269 --> 08:36.802
One thing I learned in juvie?

08:36.852 --> 08:39.272
Cash is king.

08:39.339 --> 08:41.274
Lets people know we're
not doing it for free.

08:41.341 --> 08:43.558
Wait, you think people are
going to pay us to sing?

08:43.644 --> 08:46.562
I don't think busking
is allowed in school.

08:46.647 --> 08:49.482
Watch and learn, young
Jedi in a wheelchair.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.400
(Bob Marley's "One Love" begins)

08:54.538 --> 08:56.455
This is so, so badass.

08:56.523 --> 08:58.324
I've never broken the rules like this.

09:03.664 --> 09:06.549
♪ One love ♪

09:06.633 --> 09:08.551
♪ One heart ♪

09:08.635 --> 09:13.306
♪ Let's get together

Yeah, you really can't
put a dollar amount

on the value of talent plus fear.

10:39.643 --> 10:42.294
I can. It's about 300 bucks.

10:42.345 --> 10:44.129
What are we going to do with it?

10:44.181 --> 10:46.432
Buy a butt load of clove
cigarettes, then I don't know.

10:49.352 --> 10:50.770
You want her?

10:50.821 --> 10:52.855
You don't need any cash
for that. She's free.

10:52.939 --> 10:54.857
She was my first.

10:54.941 --> 10:56.942

So go get her.

10:58.278 --> 10:59.578
It's not that simple.

10:59.646 --> 11:02.615
I was kind of mean to
her when I blew her off.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.700
This is perfect. The thing
about chicks is you only have

11:04.785 --> 11:06.819
to be a fraction as nice to
them as you are mean to them

11:06.870 --> 11:08.504
to get them to like you again.

11:08.588 --> 11:09.839

Here's a little community

11:13.993 --> 11:15.828

11:15.879 --> 11:17.379
with Santana and Brittany to the Styx.

11:18.849 --> 11:20.049
Yeah!

Kurt.

11:37.367 --> 11:40.119
So, what exactly is going on?

11:40.186 --> 11:41.537
The Warblers. Every now and then

11:41.621 --> 11:42.538
they throw an impromptu performance

11:42.622 --> 11:43.873
in the senior commons.

11:43.957 --> 11:46.024
It tends to shut the
school down for a while.

11:47.694 --> 11:50.212
So, wait, the glee club
here is kind of cool?

11:50.297 --> 11:52.331

That's what Sam said.

15:11.781 --> 15:12.898
Really?

15:12.949 --> 15:14.867
Well, then let's get a room.

15:17.504 --> 15:19.371
I love making out under the stars.

15:21.458 --> 15:26.128

be my very own situation.

15:29.082 --> 15:30.215
Slow down.

15:30.266 --> 15:31.800
Can't get caught in here.

15:31.885 --> 15:34.219
We should probably cool off.

15:35.388 --> 15:38.090
But I'm so turned on right now.

15:43.563 --> 15:45.531
This'll cool you down a little bit.

15:45.598 --> 15:46.732
(whispers): Beiste.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.484
What did you say?

15:48.568 --> 15:50.152
Nothing.

15:51.654 --> 15:53.572
I got to go.

15:53.623 --> 15:55.290
I'll see you in Glee Club.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.959
(whispers): Beiste?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.911
<i>QUINN: Just be honest
with me-- I won't get mad</i>

15:58.962 --> 16:00.462
at you if you tell me the truth.

16:00.547 --> 16:01.880
I'll be relieved.

16:01.948 --> 16:03.999
Really? Because it looks
like you're gonna be mad

16:04.084 --> 16:05.584
no matter what I say.

16:05.635 --> 16:07.786
You said another woman's name
while you were kissing me.

16:07.837 --> 16:09.221
Look, I
get it--

16:09.288 --> 16:10.956
she's in a position of power over you,

16:11.007 --> 16:12.424
which can be exciting, and you clearly

16:12.475 --> 16:14.176
like women who give you a hard time.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.895
I'm not cheating on you
with my football coach.

16:16.963 --> 16:19.348
Look, can we talk about this in private?

16:19.432 --> 16:21.633
Why, am I embarrassing you?
It's not what you think.

16:21.684 --> 16:23.969
What I think is that I'm
not putting out for you,

16:24.020 --> 16:25.437
so you're getting it wherever you can,

16:25.488 --> 16:26.822
including the locker
room with the Beiste.

16:26.906 --> 16:27.990
What's this?

16:28.074 --> 16:30.609
This is a lovers quarrel
and is your fault.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.994
Watch your tone with me, missy.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.979
You crap on my leg, I'll cut it off.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.664
I'll leave you two.

16:38.818 --> 16:39.651
Everything okay?

16:41.588 --> 16:43.956
Stay away from my woman.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.843
What hell's going on around here?

16:49.829 --> 16:51.830
What's going on, Sam?

16:58.088 --> 16:59.689
How many of the guys have done this?

16:59.773 --> 17:01.124
All the guys whose
girlfriends won't put out.

17:01.191 --> 17:02.208
It's the girls, too.

17:02.276 --> 17:03.576
This is really bad, guys.

17:03.644 --> 17:06.095
What if Coach Beiste
were to find out about it?

17:06.163 --> 17:07.829
Think about how hurt she'd be.

17:07.915 --> 17:09.198
It's not personal.

17:09.282 --> 17:10.415
Of course it's personal!

17:10.483 --> 17:11.517
Look, Coach Beiste

17:11.585 --> 17:13.453
is like us,
like Glee Club--

17:13.503 --> 17:14.971
she's an outsider at this school.

17:15.039 --> 17:17.339
No one appreciates her or her talent,

17:17.424 --> 17:19.509
because they've decided
that she's too different.

17:19.593 --> 17:22.679
And for you guys to abuse
that, even in private,

17:22.762 --> 17:25.732
is the opposite of everything
we're trying to achieve in here.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.349
But we're just thinking about it,

17:27.434 --> 17:28.501
it's not like we're actually, you know,

17:28.551 --> 17:30.169
making fun of her to her face.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.670
I need you to stop.

17:31.722 --> 17:35.975
And spread the word to all
the other Glee guys. And girls.

17:36.026 --> 17:38.444
This ends here and now.

17:38.512 --> 17:41.614
And Coach Beiste can
never know about this.

17:41.682 --> 17:42.681
Okay.

17:42.733 --> 17:43.783
Sorry.

17:43.850 --> 17:44.851
(bell rings)

17:44.918 --> 17:46.486
BLAINE: Latte? Thank you.

17:46.537 --> 17:47.820
This is Wes

17:47.871 --> 17:49.288
and David.

17:49.356 --> 17:50.990
It's very civilized

17:51.041 --> 17:52.709
for you to invite me for coffee

17:52.793 --> 17:54.510
before you beat me up for spying.

17:54.578 --> 17:57.463
We are not going to beat you
up. You were such a terrible spy,

17:57.531 --> 17:59.632
we thought it was sort of... endearing.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.467
Which made me think that spying on us

18:01.535 --> 18:03.386
wasn't really the reason you came.

18:05.089 --> 18:07.190
Can I ask you guys a question?

18:09.893 --> 18:12.645
Are you guys all gay?

18:12.713 --> 18:14.347
(laughter)

18:14.415 --> 18:16.065
BLAINE: Uh, uh, no.

18:16.133 --> 18:19.569
I mean, I am, but these
two have girlfriends.

18:19.653 --> 18:20.737
This is not a gay school.

18:20.821 --> 18:21.904
We just have a zero-tolerance

18:21.989 --> 18:23.389
harassment policy.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.858
Everybody gets treated the
same, no matter what they are.

18:25.926 --> 18:26.926
It's pretty simple.

18:32.449 --> 18:35.585
Would you guys excuse us?

18:35.669 --> 18:37.787
Yeah. Take it easy, Kurt.

18:45.012 --> 18:47.096
I take it you're having
trouble at school.

18:47.164 --> 18:50.950
I'm the only person out
of the closet at my school.

18:52.569 --> 18:55.688
And I-I... I tried to
stay strong about it,

18:55.755 --> 18:59.475
but... there's this Neanderthal
who's made it his mission

18:59.560 --> 19:02.862
to make my life a living hell.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.548
And nobody seems to notice.

19:05.616 --> 19:07.733
I know how you feel.

19:10.204 --> 19:11.988
I got taunted at my old school,

19:12.072 --> 19:15.158
and it really... pissed me off.

19:15.225 --> 19:18.144
I even complained
about it to the faculty,

19:18.212 --> 19:20.930
and they were sympathetic and all,
but you could just tell that...

19:20.998 --> 19:23.749
nobody really cared.

19:23.801 --> 19:25.635
It was, like,

19:25.702 --> 19:29.255
"Hey, if you're gay, your
life's just gonna be miserable.

19:29.323 --> 19:32.475
Sorry. Nothing we can do about it."

19:34.144 --> 19:36.979
So I left, and I came here.

19:37.064 --> 19:38.731
Simple as that.

19:38.799 --> 19:41.918
So you have two options.

19:41.985 --> 19:44.136
I mean, I'd love to tell
you to just come enroll here,

19:44.188 --> 19:46.005
but tuition at Dalton's
sort of steep, and I know

19:46.073 --> 19:47.540
that's not an option for everybody.

19:47.608 --> 19:48.858
Or...

19:48.942 --> 19:51.160
you can refuse to be the victim.

19:53.597 --> 19:56.449
Prejudice is just ignorance, Kurt,

19:56.500 --> 19:57.600
and you have a chance

19:57.668 --> 19:59.168
right now to teach him.

19:59.253 --> 20:01.971
How?

20:02.039 --> 20:03.756
Confront him.

20:03.823 --> 20:05.208
Call him out.

20:07.945 --> 20:10.346
I ran... Kurt.

20:10.430 --> 20:13.783
I didn't stand up.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.968
I let bullies chase me away,

20:16.019 --> 20:19.639
and it is something that
I really... really regret.

20:19.690 --> 20:22.141
(bell rings)

20:22.209 --> 20:24.694
The boys beat us the last
time we competed against them.

20:24.778 --> 20:26.779
We've got to bring the
noise hard this time.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.781
QUINN: To be fair, they
didn't officially beat us.

20:28.848 --> 20:31.350
We got busted for vitamin D
possession before the vote.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.569
Wait. Something's definitely wrong.

20:33.654 --> 20:35.454
Why isn't Rachel
talking? Yeah, she should

20:35.522 --> 20:37.039
totally be bossing us around right now.

20:37.124 --> 20:39.125
The idea of the assignment
was to do the opposite

20:39.192 --> 20:40.660
or what we normally do.

20:40.711 --> 20:42.912
I'm just trying to stick
to the lesson plan, which is

20:42.996 --> 20:44.347
proving nearly impossible

20:44.414 --> 20:45.748
since you're gluing those
sequins on backwards.

20:47.084 --> 20:48.134
Spies!

20:48.201 --> 20:49.252
Lighten up--
we're here

20:49.336 --> 20:50.836
to talk to Santana and Brittany.

20:50.888 --> 20:53.372
PUCK (quietly): Remember,
don't trust your instincts.

20:53.423 --> 20:56.976
Hmm. So, how does it
feel to be a free man?

20:57.043 --> 20:58.411
All I can say is that I don't want

20:58.478 --> 20:59.812
a long-term relationship
with either of you.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.264
Especially Brittany, since
I'm not in love with her.

21:01.331 --> 21:03.733
Do you guys want to go
out to dinner tonight?

21:03.817 --> 21:05.551
Not really.

21:05.619 --> 21:07.219
Oh. Tell you what,

21:07.271 --> 21:09.589
you two show up at Breadstix
tomorrow night around 7:00.

21:09.656 --> 21:11.190
If we don't find hotter
chicks to date tonight,

21:11.241 --> 21:12.158
we might show up.

21:12.226 --> 21:13.342
(gasps)

21:13.410 --> 21:14.627
You are totally cool.

21:14.695 --> 21:15.661
Awesome.

21:17.464 --> 21:19.532
I can't believe it.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.168
You're a genius.

21:22.235 --> 21:24.069
(bell rings)

21:26.406 --> 21:27.957
Hey, Will,

21:28.041 --> 21:30.092
can I talk to you for a second?

21:30.177 --> 21:32.845
Yeah. What's going on
with your Glee Club kids?

21:32.913 --> 21:35.414
They've been mouthing off to me.

21:35.465 --> 21:38.768
One of them even said to
stay away from their girl?

21:38.852 --> 21:40.636
I-I don't get it.

21:40.721 --> 21:42.521
You know, I'm the coach here, Will,

21:42.589 --> 21:44.540
and if the students
here don't respect me...

21:44.608 --> 21:47.476
pfft, I can't do my job.

21:48.912 --> 21:50.613
(sighs) Well, Coach...

21:52.932 --> 21:56.118
I... I don't know what to tell you.

21:56.203 --> 21:58.604
Will, please, be straight with me.

21:58.655 --> 22:00.373
You're the only person

22:00.440 --> 22:02.158
at this school I trust.

22:04.077 --> 22:05.995
Please.

22:06.063 --> 22:09.048
(sighs)

22:09.116 --> 22:10.967
Why don't you have a seat?

22:19.559 --> 22:22.094
Uh...

22:22.162 --> 22:24.930
Th-Th-This is
really awful,

22:24.982 --> 22:27.400
and I don't want you
to take it personally.

22:27.467 --> 22:28.484
I mean, they're just kids.

22:28.568 --> 22:30.736
You-you know how they can be.

22:30.804 --> 22:32.922
Just-just tell me.

22:32.990 --> 22:35.775
(sighs)

22:35.826 --> 22:38.177
I-I guess...

22:38.245 --> 22:42.348
it's... become sort of a-a thing,

22:42.416 --> 22:46.369
that... when the kids
are making out, and...

22:49.156 --> 22:54.377
Th-Th-They sort of want
to... cool off a little...

22:57.080 --> 22:58.631
They think of you.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.768
In compromising positions.

23:02.836 --> 23:04.503
(sighs)

23:05.839 --> 23:08.007
Like what?

23:10.560 --> 23:13.045
Like...

23:13.113 --> 23:15.481
in lingerie...

23:15.532 --> 23:16.816
Oh...

23:16.867 --> 23:18.484
Coach, don't take it personally.

23:18.535 --> 23:21.253
I do take it personally, Will.

23:21.321 --> 23:22.521
(sighs)

23:22.572 --> 23:25.458
I take it very, very personally.

23:27.911 --> 23:29.795
No. Sh-Shannon.

23:29.863 --> 23:31.247
Shannon, wait. I...

23:33.032 --> 23:34.700
(groans)

23:34.751 --> 23:36.368
(school bell rings)

23:39.327 --> 23:40.377
So there I was. At juvie.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.745
In the breakfast line in the mess hall.

23:41.813 --> 23:43.130
When I notice me and this guy behind me

23:43.181 --> 23:44.181
going for the same waffle.

23:44.265 --> 23:46.517
This guy's 6'11",

23:46.601 --> 23:48.802
300, easy. He's got his
teeth filed into canines.

23:48.853 --> 23:51.438
Tats everywhere. Oh, it gets better.

23:51.506 --> 23:53.524
So I turn around.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.110
I flex my left pec,
then I flex my right pec,

23:56.177 --> 23:58.195
and I say to the guy...

23:58.279 --> 24:01.515
"L'eggo my Eggo."

24:02.367 --> 24:04.401
And you know what he does?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.203
He lets go of my Eggo.

24:06.287 --> 24:07.821
Right.

24:07.872 --> 24:09.490
You should be our nation's president.

24:09.541 --> 24:10.541
Maybe.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.026
I've been squeezing your leg

24:13.078 --> 24:14.578
for, like, the last hour and a half.

24:14.663 --> 24:16.029
Are you not attracted to me?

24:17.749 --> 24:19.700
Sorry. I was really
distracted by our waitress.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.054
She's totally into me.

24:24.139 --> 24:25.389
I can take that when you're ready.

24:28.476 --> 24:29.710
All right, guys. Let's move.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.979
This meal has been comped.

24:32.046 --> 24:33.764
What?

24:33.848 --> 24:35.182
Dude, I don't pay for food.

24:35.233 --> 24:36.350
It's my thing, yo.

24:36.401 --> 24:38.268
So we're going to dine and dash.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.523
Let's go.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.238
Do you need any change?

24:58.289 --> 24:59.873
Keep it.

24:59.924 --> 25:01.074
Thanks.

25:01.126 --> 25:04.128
What the hell was that about?

25:04.212 --> 25:06.046
Sorry. I couldn't do it.

25:06.114 --> 25:08.582
She gave us free refills.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.850
And I figure she's got kids.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.084
I'm not gonna do that to her.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.970
Whatever, dude. You wussed out.

25:13.038 --> 25:14.304
So have fun taking the short bus home,

25:14.389 --> 25:16.356
'cause I'll be escorting
these lovely ladies

25:16.424 --> 25:18.425
back to Chez Puckerman
for a little sookie-sookie.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.560
Wait, seriously?

25:19.611 --> 25:20.861
Damn straight.

25:20.928 --> 25:22.396
I'm giving you all
my trade secrets here.

25:22.447 --> 25:23.397
If you don't want my help, then fine.

25:23.448 --> 25:24.431
You're on your own.

WILL: Ladies, very, very impressive.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.856
What was it that made you
guys choose those songs?

27:28.907 --> 27:29.940
Well...

27:30.024 --> 27:31.859
Coach said to give you this.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.369
Take a good look, William.

27:42.437 --> 27:45.172
Because Sue Sylvester's
got two things to show you.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.207
To my left, I have one

27:47.275 --> 27:48.408
confetti cannon.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.576
To my right,

27:49.627 --> 27:51.461
you'll find another confetti cannon.

27:51.546 --> 27:52.913
You know what that means?

27:52.981 --> 27:55.015
(sighs) No, Sue.

27:55.083 --> 27:58.268
We got Beiste fired.

27:58.336 --> 28:01.021
And my full budget is restored.

28:01.089 --> 28:02.923
(remote beeps)

28:06.811 --> 28:09.930
(laughing maniacally)

28:09.981 --> 28:11.698
Wait, what?

28:11.766 --> 28:12.866
Well, actually she quit.

28:12.934 --> 28:14.401
But I'll take the W.

28:14.452 --> 28:16.620
<i>And it was your kids
that made it happen, Will.</i>

28:16.704 --> 28:19.273
It finally occurred to them to
stop singing all that nonsense

28:19.340 --> 28:20.490
about how awesome it is

28:20.575 --> 28:23.126
to be alive or ugly or whatever

28:23.211 --> 28:24.711
the point is you guys
are always trying to make.

28:24.779 --> 28:26.380
And instead?

28:26.447 --> 28:27.631
They just got mean.

28:29.817 --> 28:31.618
Congratulations, Will.

28:31.669 --> 28:34.304
Wait, Coach Beiste quit?

28:34.389 --> 28:35.973
I believe I just said
that, Annie Sullivan.

28:36.057 --> 28:38.308
You want me to sign it into your palm?

28:38.393 --> 28:40.227
And, now, if you'll excuse me...

28:40.294 --> 28:43.313
And if you wouldn't mind
just cleaning all this up,

28:43.398 --> 28:44.982
that'd be great.

28:49.237 --> 28:51.071
(school bell rings)

29:07.154 --> 29:08.655
Hey!

29:09.791 --> 29:11.825
I am talking to you!

29:11.876 --> 29:13.126
Girls' locker room is next door.

29:13.177 --> 29:14.795
What is your problem?

29:14.846 --> 29:16.763
Excuse me? What are you so scared of?

29:16.831 --> 29:19.383
Besides you sneaking in
here to peek at my junk?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.517
Oh, yeah, every straight guy's nightmare

29:20.601 --> 29:22.019
that all of us gays are secretly out

29:22.103 --> 29:24.054
to molest and convert you.
Well, guess what, ham hock?

29:24.138 --> 29:26.556
You're not my type! That right?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.025
Yes, I don't dig on chubby boys

29:28.109 --> 29:29.175
who sweat too much and
are going to be bald

29:29.227 --> 29:30.110
by the time they're 30.

29:30.177 --> 29:31.311
Do not push me, Hummel.

29:31.362 --> 29:32.512
You going to hit me?

29:32.563 --> 29:34.731
Do it. Don't push me!

29:34.816 --> 29:36.700
Hit me, 'cause it's not
going to change who I am.

29:36.784 --> 29:38.318
You can't punch the
gay out of me any more

29:38.369 --> 29:39.569
than I can punch the
ignoramus out of you!

29:39.654 --> 29:41.321
I said get out of my face!

29:41.372 --> 29:43.523
You are nothing but a scared
little boy who can't handle

29:43.574 --> 29:45.542
how extraordinarily ordinary you are!

29:53.718 --> 29:55.218
(grunts in frustration)

30:07.149 --> 30:08.349
(school bell rings)

30:08.433 --> 30:10.401
Well, I genuinely
hope you guys are happy

30:10.468 --> 30:12.703
because Coach Beiste has quit.

30:12.771 --> 30:15.156
Wait, what? That's terrible.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.490
Yeah, that's not what we want.

30:16.575 --> 30:17.975
That's the opposite of what we want.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.326
The football team was actually winning.

30:19.411 --> 30:20.711
Well, then, you'd better
put your heads together

30:20.779 --> 30:22.279
and find a way to get her back, fast,

30:22.347 --> 30:24.999
because I am actually ashamed of you.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.818
You really hurt someone who was
a great addition to this school.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.587
I'm sorry, what exactly did we do?

30:29.654 --> 30:31.739
No, no. It's us. The boys.

30:31.807 --> 30:33.174
And Tina.

30:34.593 --> 30:37.011
We sort of figured out
that picturing Beiste

30:37.095 --> 30:38.996
while making out was even
better than a cold shower.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.381
I-I mean, I don't...

30:40.465 --> 30:42.099
Ever.

30:42.167 --> 30:44.501
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.720
SANTANA: Can I just say that this is

30:45.804 --> 30:46.971
what happens when people don't put out?

30:47.038 --> 30:48.222
If everyone just put out,

30:48.290 --> 30:49.473
we would have a winning football team.

30:49.524 --> 30:51.525
William.

30:51.610 --> 30:54.478
I need to see you and Noah
Puckerman in my office, please.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.199
This is garbage!

30:58.283 --> 30:59.817
I've been doing my community service.

30:59.868 --> 31:01.152
When you wrote "hangin' with a crip"

31:01.203 --> 31:02.686
on your probation application,

31:02.738 --> 31:04.705
we thought you were going to
do outreach with a local gang.

31:04.773 --> 31:06.373
But I've totally been helping Artie.

31:06.441 --> 31:08.525
I got him a date. I
made him some sweet cash.

31:08.577 --> 31:10.127
Please, Mr. Shue, you've
got to help me out here.

31:10.195 --> 31:12.329
Ms. Martin, there's
got to be some way Puck

31:12.380 --> 31:13.697
can make up for this.

31:13.749 --> 31:14.832
He's been a model
student since he got back.

31:14.883 --> 31:16.500
Three whole days worth. Impressive.

31:16.568 --> 31:18.636
Look, there are rules.

31:18.703 --> 31:20.504
If Mr. Puckerman doesn't
find a suitable alternative

31:20.572 --> 31:21.972
for his community service by tomorrow,

31:22.040 --> 31:23.457
his probation will be revoked,

31:23.525 --> 31:25.643
and he'll have to go back to
the Mondale School for the Boys.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.311
Oh, screw that. I am
not going back there.

31:27.378 --> 31:29.180
Mr. Puckerman, calm down!

31:29.231 --> 31:30.181
No, you calm down!

31:30.232 --> 31:31.632
All of you, calm down!

31:31.700 --> 31:33.567
I told you, I'm not going back there!

31:33.652 --> 31:35.052
What are you writing? Give me that.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.887
Puck, this isn't helping!

31:36.938 --> 31:40.441
Helping? Since when does any
one of you care about helping me?

31:40.525 --> 31:41.659
None of you care about me!

31:41.726 --> 31:42.860

31:50.902 --> 31:52.253
KURT: Thanks again for coming.

31:52.337 --> 31:54.839
Don't worry about it.
Just let me do the talking.

31:55.791 --> 31:56.907
KURT: There he is.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.460
I got your back.

31:59.544 --> 32:00.795
BLAINE: Excuse me?

32:00.879 --> 32:02.046
Hey, lady boys.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.765
This your boyfriend, Kurt?

32:04.850 --> 32:06.634
Kurt and I would like to
talk to you about something.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.269
I gotta go to class.

32:08.353 --> 32:09.720
Kurt told me what you did.

32:09.771 --> 32:12.556
Oh yeah, what's that?

32:12.607 --> 32:14.308
You kissed me.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.443
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:16.528 --> 32:19.096
It seems like you might
be a little confused,

32:19.147 --> 32:21.198
and that's totally normal.

32:21.266 --> 32:23.284
This is a... a very hard thing

32:23.368 --> 32:25.402
to come to terms with,
and you should just know

32:25.453 --> 32:27.822
that you're not alone.

32:27.906 --> 32:30.124
Do not mess with me.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.109
You have to stop this!

32:46.007 --> 32:48.259
Well, he's not coming out anytime soon.

32:52.430 --> 32:56.466
What's going on?

32:57.635 --> 33:00.571
Why are you so upset?

33:00.638 --> 33:04.859
(exhales) Because up until
yesterday, I had never been kissed.

33:04.943 --> 33:07.978
Or at least... one that counted.

33:14.336 --> 33:16.170
Come on.

33:16.254 --> 33:18.289
I'll buy you lunch.

33:28.333 --> 33:31.018
(sniffles)

33:36.474 --> 33:38.475
Didn't make you for a quitter.

33:38.526 --> 33:40.027
Don't, Will.

33:40.111 --> 33:42.346
You have no idea what it's like.

33:42.397 --> 33:45.049
For what it's worth...
the kids feel awful.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.068
They like you.

33:48.153 --> 33:49.687
They respect you.

33:49.754 --> 33:53.807
Isn't that just what every
girl wants to hear from a guy?

33:53.875 --> 33:56.693
Nah, screw this.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.079
I'll find my bliss somewhere else.

33:59.147 --> 34:01.966
I... I need a life change.

34:02.033 --> 34:06.754
You know, maybe I'll get a job
as a cooler at a honky-tonk bar.

34:06.838 --> 34:09.873
I don't know, maybe an ice road trucker.

34:09.925 --> 34:11.175
Stop.

34:11.226 --> 34:13.210
Will you just stop?

34:13.261 --> 34:14.978
I get it.

34:15.045 --> 34:17.681
All of us are scarred by high school.

34:17.732 --> 34:20.818
You know, next to our parents,

relive that pain every day.

intimidating sometimes, but...

Well, that's what dating is for.

34:56.855 --> 35:00.941

on, the guy was a freak.

35:01.026 --> 35:03.160
All he wanted to do was wrestle.
