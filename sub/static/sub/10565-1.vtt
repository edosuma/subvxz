01:16.676 --> 01:20.007
(recording playing in 
various languages)

02:23.476 --> 02:26.001
Recording:
You're all that's left of us.

02:26.045 --> 02:29.879
Good luck.
God bless.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.510
And Godspeed.

05:10.843 --> 05:13.073

05:23.790 --> 05:26.122
Bower.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.211
Bower.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.226
(groaning)

06:13.940 --> 06:17.501
"In the event
of mild memory loss

extended hypersleep..."

(clicking)

06:48.040 --> 06:50.372
(grunts)

06:54.313 --> 06:56.338
Lieutenant!

06:57.350 --> 06:59.113
Lieutenant Payton!

06:59.152 --> 07:01.120
(silent)

(rumbling)

08:06.252 --> 08:08.117
(rumbling stops)

08:17.029 --> 08:19.623
Hey. Hey.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.758
(screams)

08:21.801 --> 08:23.928
(gasping)

08:27.440 --> 08:29.965
- Who are you?
- I'm Bower.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.443
Corporal Bower, sir.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.038
Bower?
Bower?

08:35.081 --> 08:37.572
You're waking
from extended hypersleep.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.414
- Bower?
- This is disorientation.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.511
Could you get that
fucking light out of my eyes?

08:42.554 --> 08:43.852
Sorry, sir.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.317
(groans)
Where are we?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.351
Aboard the Elysium.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.365
The Elysium?

08:53.399 --> 08:56.300
Where are we?

08:56.335 --> 08:58.599
I don't know.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.970
Where's the rest of the crew?

09:02.675 --> 09:04.267
Is it our shift?

09:04.310 --> 09:07.074
- Our rotation?
- I believe so.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.240
Aren't they supposed
to be here to wake us up?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.113
I don't know.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.685
Hit the lights, will you?

09:19.492 --> 09:22.086
There's a problem
with the power, sir.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.097
(groaning)

09:25.131 --> 09:26.723
Who woke you up?

09:26.766 --> 09:29.064
It had to have been
the flight computer.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.695
There's no one here
except us.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.228
It's cold.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.299
I've been awake for over an hour
and I still can't remember anything.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.913
The last time I crawled out
of a hyperbunk

09:41.948 --> 09:44.610
it took me quite a while
to get it all back.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.118
What was your...

09:47.153 --> 09:49.087
what was your last flight, sir?

09:49.121 --> 09:51.089
I don't know.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.091
Sir, do you even know
where we're going?

09:53.125 --> 09:55.992
I remember the training,

09:56.028 --> 09:59.361
but not the destination,
the mission.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.593
I figured you'd tell me.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.124
Payton:
If this really is our ship,

10:03.169 --> 10:05.262
then this room should
be locked into position

10:05.304 --> 10:08.398
and behind that door
should be the bridge.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.602
Jesus.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.702
Somebody was trying to get out.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.951
- Lieutenant.
- (blows)

10:20.987 --> 10:23.421
None of the activators are working.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.753
Yeah, it figures.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.319
Without unified threading
we can't connect.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.124
Hold on here.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.562
We can at least
get this station to work.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.600
(humming)

10:40.406 --> 10:42.340
(laughs)

10:42.375 --> 10:44.843
I didn't even think of that.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.141
(chuckles)

10:47.179 --> 10:49.613
All right. Jesus.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.678
Lieutenant Payton on the com.
Anybody copy?

10:57.690 --> 11:00.989
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team...

11:02.662 --> 11:04.823
Shit.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.889
- 5.
- How do you know that?

11:11.737 --> 11:14.365
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.637
Anybody copy?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.611
Anyone respond.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.147
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.275
Anybody awake up there?

11:25.317 --> 11:27.911
Team 4 is supposed
to be here for flight rotation.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.648
Where could they be?

11:31.323 --> 11:33.188
Maybe they couldn't get to us.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.563
Where did he go?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.831
(rumbling)

11:46.872 --> 11:51.036
Power systems must be free floating
between uncoupled circuits,

11:51.077 --> 11:53.739
or something the override grid
won't even lock in.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.269
What do you think?

11:55.314 --> 11:56.542
(rumbling stops)

11:56.582 --> 11:59.050
(clanking)

11:59.085 --> 12:00.746
Somebody's up there.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.086
Uh, it's ventilation.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.616
The system keeps rebooting
after each surge.

12:08.661 --> 12:09.958
That could be anything.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.931
Listen, I think we should
get out of here.

12:13.966 --> 12:17.129
I'd rather be up and out
than stuck in the trunk, wouldn't you?

12:18.137 --> 12:19.431
Test test.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.872
Payton: Copy.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.605
Lift me up.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.483
Our 2nd lieutenant must
have come through here.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.716
It's the only way.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.459
It's fucking dark in here.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.463
Payton: Don't worry.
Just take the first way out.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.694
I'll guide you back here to open
the doors from the outside.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.636
How are we doing?

12:53.672 --> 12:55.469
See anything?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.135
Nothing yet.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.111
Not a single vent opening
or anything.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.876
What about on your end?

13:02.915 --> 13:04.348
(rumbling)

13:04.383 --> 13:07.750
Power surges keep happening
in longer increments just like you said.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.187
Reactor timing is offset in the core.

13:10.222 --> 13:14.056
It's trying to reconnect.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.993
But it won't until it's reset.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.121
Payton:
How do you know that?

13:20.032 --> 13:23.126
I don't know.
I can't even remember my... Jesus Christ!

13:26.071 --> 13:29.370
But I know everything there is
to know about that damn reactor.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.206
Payton:
That's the training talking.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.836
You must be our technical engineer.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.507
(rumbling)

13:41.554 --> 13:43.146
Found an intersection.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.623
Copy that.
Anything look promising?

13:45.658 --> 13:48.354
A whole lot of the same...
nothing.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.232
- Taking a left. Make a note.
- Payton: Left it is.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.384
(clanging)

14:20.559 --> 14:21.992
Payton.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.568
Payton!
Payton, do you copy?

14:31.604 --> 14:34.334
I don't know if I'm going in circles.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.840
And, um, I can't breathe.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.109
Payton, do you copy?

14:42.147 --> 14:44.047
Payton:
I'm here. I'm here.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.610
Easy now, easy. Breathe.
Just listen to me.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.179
- I just want to stand up.
- Calm down.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.919
- I can't breathe.
- Stop it and listen to me.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.086
- Now let's just get you back here.
- Back?

14:56.128 --> 14:59.564
Are you fucking kidding me?
I can't even turn around.

14:59.598 --> 15:02.089
Do you know
how far I've gone, Payton?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.898
- Listen to me.
- I just want out of this fucking thing!

15:04.937 --> 15:08.134
Payton:
Put your mind somewhere else.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.869
Like where?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.003
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

15:13.045 --> 15:14.706
but I got the door open.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.348
You fucking kidding me?

15:19.385 --> 15:22.320
Yeah, I'm kidding you.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.653
(laughs)

15:25.691 --> 15:28.285
You see?
Now that's not so bad.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.319
We're gonna get you through this.
We're gonna figure this out together.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.388
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.195
You spent eight years
in the hyperbunk.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.498
A couple of more minutes
in a shaft won't kill you.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.730
Eight years?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.899
I do remember two years
being our duty rotation.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.536
If we're team 5, that means
we've been out for eight years.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.102
I don't think
you're here by default.

15:48.147 --> 15:51.173
You were a select pick.
We all were.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.684
This was something special.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.951
Someone's been through here.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.355
- Wait a second.
- What's wrong?

16:03.362 --> 16:06.297
I'm at an angle.
Oh shit, I'm at an angle.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.629
I'm at an angle!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.163
(groans)

16:11.203 --> 16:14.172
Bower, what happened?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.006
What is it?

16:21.046 --> 16:23.981
Bower, are you hurt?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.541
(groaning)

16:32.458 --> 16:34.551
Bower, what happened?

16:37.029 --> 16:39.122
I can hear you breathing.
Are you all right?

17:03.055 --> 17:05.215
(groaning)

17:13.232 --> 17:15.757
- Can you hear me?
- (breathing heavily)

17:21.073 --> 17:23.007
(groans)

17:23.041 --> 17:26.603
Bower, are you all right?

17:28.747 --> 17:30.977
I've... I've found Cooper.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.985
He's dead.
I'm in a boot locker.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.384
(rumbling)

17:35.421 --> 17:37.821
(groans)

17:37.856 --> 17:40.086
Bower?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.120
You all right?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.097
Make that an overhead compartment.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.661
Payton, I got out.

17:55.674 --> 17:59.235
- (static)
- Payton?

17:59.278 --> 18:01.212
Bower, do you hear me?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.181
Do you read?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.116
(creaking)

18:11.190 --> 18:13.090
(panting)

18:16.395 --> 18:18.420
Payton, are you there?

18:18.464 --> 18:20.762
Payton, can you hear me?

18:40.252 --> 18:42.345
Payton, do you copy?

18:43.422 --> 18:45.447
(lights crackling)

18:45.491 --> 18:47.823
Payton?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.294
Corporal, can you hear me?

18:52.664 --> 18:54.564
Corporal, can you hear me?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.459
(clanging)

19:15.287 --> 19:18.222
(grunting)

19:18.257 --> 19:20.020
Hey.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.583
Hey, I need to talk to you!

19:22.628 --> 19:24.721
Wait! Stop!

19:31.103 --> 19:33.230
Don't run again, okay?

19:33.272 --> 19:36.264
I don't care if you were
stealing or anything.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.209
I just want to ask you
a couple questions.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.481
How are you awake?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.347
Hello?

19:54.793 --> 19:56.852
Hello!

19:56.895 --> 19:59.455
What, are you fucking deaf?

20:03.735 --> 20:04.997
Hello?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.406
Jesus!

20:38.670 --> 20:41.366
- (speaking German)
- What?

20:45.277 --> 20:46.869
Don't move.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.914
Wait. Wait a second.
I'm with the flight crew.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.180
Don't you move.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.519
Really, I'm part of the flight crew.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.184
- Take them off.
- What?

21:03.228 --> 21:05.492
Shoes.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.930
I'll gut your ass.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.735
- (gasps)
- (roaring)

21:31.523 --> 21:34.321
(growling)

21:34.359 --> 21:37.294
(roaring)

21:52.344 --> 21:54.437
(crunching)

22:00.752 --> 22:02.310
(roaring)

22:10.896 --> 22:12.887
(panting)

22:35.220 --> 22:36.551
What the?

22:36.588 --> 22:39.113
(growling)

22:43.662 --> 22:45.289
(roaring)

22:53.638 --> 22:56.436
(roaring)

23:09.287 --> 23:12.347
(sniffing)

23:12.391 --> 23:14.416
(growls)

23:23.668 --> 23:25.260
Payton:
Bower, do you read?

23:45.290 --> 23:47.087
- (roaring)
- (gasps)

23:54.533 --> 23:56.364
God damn it, answer me.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.801
(growling)

24:08.914 --> 24:10.711
Payton:
Bower, do you hear me?

24:12.017 --> 24:14.110
Do you read?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.212
(Bower whispering)
You are not hearing me.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.315
There's no procedure for this.
They can't write a book for this.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.826
After what I just saw, procedure
just went out the fucking window.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.829
Payton:
Listen, I need you to calm down.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.423
You're all we've got out there
if we're gonna figure this out.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.696
Let's get back to these...
these other guys.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.965
Guys?
Those weren't guys.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.472
They were hunting.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.874
They... they took Cooper's body.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.640
Just like a fucking pack of...

24:43.248 --> 24:45.910
They didn't seem human.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.409
We have to try
and contact the bridge.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.912
You're assuming that there
is someone on the bridge.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.256
There has to be.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.885
We can't be alone in this.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.987
Well, alone or not,

24:59.030 --> 25:01.521
we can't assume help will be coming.

25:03.201 --> 25:07.160
Out here there is no rescue
and there is no turning around.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.402
I don't think this thing
was even built to return.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.875
What are you talking about?

25:11.910 --> 25:14.879
I'm saying that this
is no ordinary transport.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.313
We're not out on the belt
collecting data.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.943
We're not hauling cargo.

25:19.985 --> 25:23.045
We are the cargo.

25:24.122 --> 25:27.717
60,000 people
on a single launch trajectory.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.193
Tanis.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.856
Man on TV:
25 billion people watched in awe.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.765
These breathtaking images
of Tanis arrived

25:35.800 --> 25:38.530
from the Popolous probe and were
broadcast yesterday.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.970
These were taken as the probe
was entering the orbit

25:41.006 --> 25:43.634
of the only Earth like planet
known to exist.

25:43.675 --> 25:47.167
People of the whole world are watching
as the probe sent into space

25:47.212 --> 25:51.740
is transferring data exceeding
even the most optimistic expectations.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.217
We knew to expect water on Tanis.

25:54.252 --> 25:56.516
We knew to expect
reasonable temperatures.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.284
But the questioned remained...

25:58.323 --> 26:01.986
will this planet meet the extremely
complex and unlikely combination

26:02.027 --> 26:05.394
of parameters to support life
as we know it?

26:05.430 --> 26:08.194
The probe has touched down
on the planet six days ago.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.292
It's sending off its first transmission

26:10.335 --> 26:13.304
that is expected
to arrive any second now.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.397
(man speaking over radio)

26:25.116 --> 26:27.346
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:27.385 --> 26:30.843
this is an unprecedented
moment for all mankind.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.357
Are we seeing this?

26:33.391 --> 26:35.586
First detection as we had hoped.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.857
This needs to be verified,
but it appears

26:37.896 --> 26:40.660
some form of plant life is present.

26:40.699 --> 26:44.362
My God, life on Tanis.
There is life detection.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.495
We have habitat detection.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.598
Verified, this is a monumental
day for all of us.

26:49.641 --> 26:52.735
Only a matter of time before
we send people out there.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.938
Processing and population.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.777
We're a settlers vessel.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.908
Elysium was a one-way ticket.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.853
How could I have...

27:02.887 --> 27:04.286
left her?

27:05.991 --> 27:07.788
How could I have done that?

27:10.595 --> 27:12.119
I loved her.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.935
Payton:
We've got to get to the bridge.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.564
We've got to get control of the ship
before these guys rip it apart.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.130
This is too fucking important.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.870
- Payton, where is your wife?
- What?

27:25.910 --> 27:28.435
Do you remember the recruitment?
The breeding tests,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.141
the husbands, the wives?

27:30.181 --> 27:33.947
We didn't leave them behind.
They're here somewhere onboard.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.942
I've got to find her before
these fucking animals do.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.208
Try to think.
Where would they be?

28:02.247 --> 28:04.374
A sleeping compartment
for non-service personnel?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.213
Wait, hold on.
Think for a second.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.219
I remember there were thousands
of passengers that weren't part

28:08.253 --> 28:10.778
- of the development team. Families.
- You listen to me.

28:10.822 --> 28:14.189
You know how big this ship is?
And you have no idea where your wife...

28:14.225 --> 28:17.251
where our wives might be.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.786
If you go off on some
wild goose chase

28:19.831 --> 28:23.927
we're gonna be no closer to getting
ourselves out of this situation

28:23.968 --> 28:26.903
and with even less time
to regain control of the ship.

28:26.938 --> 28:31.102
Once we've taken control of the systems,
finding them will be easy.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.042
Are you hearing me?

28:34.312 --> 28:37.406
We save the ship,
we save them.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.153
- Security locker.
- What?

28:52.530 --> 28:54.998
Non-lethal antiriot guns.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.695
Payton:
Close up they'll do some damage.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.487
(humming)

29:27.465 --> 29:29.729
All right, I'm gonna lay out
a path for you

29:29.768 --> 29:32.498
and try to bypass
the main security grids.

29:32.537 --> 29:36.064
Without main power
we'll never get these doors open.

29:36.107 --> 29:39.133
Listen, if you can get me
to the reactor bay

29:39.177 --> 29:41.771
I can reset the cycle manually.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.804
Payton:
You know how to do that?

29:43.848 --> 29:46.681
- Yeah.
- It's a long way.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.619
Gonna have to get you past
a few security bulkheads.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.986
With a little sidestepping,
we're gonna get you there.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.521
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Delta 81643 Lima.

29:59.564 --> 30:00.997
Okay okay, hold on.

30:01.032 --> 30:03.227
I don't want you going too far.
Just catch your breath.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.236
I don't need a rest.
Just tell me which way.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.465
I don't know yet.
Hold on.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.746
Payton.

30:23.221 --> 30:27.123
Pandorum, you ever
felt the symptoms?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.926
Of all the things to remember,
why would you pick that?

30:34.432 --> 30:36.593
Were you thinking
of the Eden mission?

30:36.634 --> 30:38.568
What about the Eden?

30:40.505 --> 30:44.771
You just had to remind me of the biggest
fucking catastrophe in space travel.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.702
The flight cautionary tale from hell.

30:48.746 --> 30:51.214
I remember.
Didn't they have some kind of

30:51.249 --> 30:54.685
hypersleep malfunction?

30:54.719 --> 30:57.779
Payton: Two years into their shift
one of their officers

30:57.822 --> 31:00.188
had a psychological breakdown.

31:00.225 --> 31:03.524
The doctors refer
to it as ODS syndrome.

31:03.561 --> 31:07.429
But the pilots,
we call it pandorum.

31:08.633 --> 31:12.330
It drove him insane. He became
convinced the flight was cursed.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.764
- Evil.
- Bower: What did he do?

31:15.807 --> 31:17.434
(alarm blaring)

31:17.475 --> 31:19.636
Payton:
He evacuated the ship.

31:22.647 --> 31:26.048
He launched them all
into oblivion.

31:26.084 --> 31:29.212
5,000 people sent to their death

31:29.254 --> 31:31.119
with one push of a button.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.123
Bower: At least we didn't wake up
floating away in a coffin.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.725
Payton:
Who says we didn't?

31:51.876 --> 31:54.344
- Which way?
- Left at the third marker.

31:54.379 --> 31:57.371
Just two more levels up
and we're on the main walkway.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.882
Should be easy from there.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.087
This can't be right.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.393
What's not right?

32:13.431 --> 32:16.491
I don't know if I'm hallucinating.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.229
What?
What's going on?

32:20.271 --> 32:23.035
I've seen this before.
This is a...

32:30.581 --> 32:32.344
this...

32:32.383 --> 32:34.874
this is a different one.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.724
It's booby-trapped.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.854
Rigged the ceiling.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.330
Payton: Be careful.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.767
No! No!

32:52.804 --> 32:54.829
No!

32:54.872 --> 32:56.237
Quiet!

32:58.509 --> 33:01.137
- Quiet! Shh.
- (panting)

33:01.179 --> 33:03.511
We have to shut the hell up.
Do you understand?

33:03.548 --> 33:06.039
I'm gonna get you out of this,
but you have to be quiet.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.143
You understand?

33:11.022 --> 33:13.149
Payton:
Bower, you sure this is a good idea?

33:16.394 --> 33:18.862
Watch yourself.

33:23.134 --> 33:24.726
He's team 6.

33:24.769 --> 33:28.398
That's the shift unit
that's supposed to follow us.

33:28.439 --> 33:30.703
Payton: He could be...

33:30.742 --> 33:32.369
Quiet. Quiet!

33:32.410 --> 33:35.538
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you
but you have to be quiet.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.980
Do you hear me?

33:40.718 --> 33:43.812
Shepard, team 6, sir.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.387
I believe I'm the only one.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.087
I knew it.
I knew you'd come back.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.323
- What?
- Where's your squad?

33:52.363 --> 33:55.127
Squad?
This is my lieutenant.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.760
- Where's your shuttle?
- Shuttle? What are you talking about?

33:57.802 --> 33:59.599
You're the retraction crew, right?

33:59.637 --> 34:02.765
No. No.
I'm team 5.

34:02.807 --> 34:05.833
- You just woke up?
- Six or eight hours ago.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.139
So you don't know
what the fuck is going on?

34:07.178 --> 34:08.577
That's what I'm saying.

34:08.612 --> 34:11.581
- You know as much as me, man.
- I don't know anything.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.676
You, you're gonna fit right in.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.520
What are you doing?

34:18.556 --> 34:19.887
- Get the scent off.
- Scent?

34:19.924 --> 34:21.824
They're fast and they're fucking
stronger than you know.

34:21.859 --> 34:25.123
They come after you, you run.
You run and you don't fucking look back.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.790
I can't wait for you.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.857
Who... who are they?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.527
- I can't help you.
- Help me.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.538
Payton: Bower, you tell that asshole
the chain of command

34:34.572 --> 34:36.972
- and a direct order is being made.
- You're still an officer on this ship,

34:37.007 --> 34:39.168
and at the current time
your CO is ordering you...

34:39.210 --> 34:41.371
- Ordering me? That's funny.
...now is ordering you...

34:41.411 --> 34:43.312
You're late.
There's no fucking CO on this ship.

34:43.347 --> 34:44.643
Fuck you.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.946
(roaring)

34:54.324 --> 34:56.350
(whimpering)

35:00.398 --> 35:01.490
That's not gonna save you.

35:05.536 --> 35:08.061
(snarling, growling)

35:08.106 --> 35:09.698
Payton:
Get the hell out of there.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.307
Get out of there!

35:32.029 --> 35:33.724
Ah!

35:34.732 --> 35:36.461
(roaring)

35:43.374 --> 35:44.671
(whispering)
Go.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.210
(screaming)

36:06.731 --> 36:08.722
(thuds)

36:09.734 --> 36:12.567
(groans)

36:15.139 --> 36:16.936
(roars)

36:18.576 --> 36:19.941
Just run.
Go!

36:34.592 --> 36:36.355
(screaming)

36:55.580 --> 36:57.548
(winces)

37:01.252 --> 37:03.379
- (roaring)
- (screams)

37:15.499 --> 37:17.933
(speaking Vietnamese)

37:19.704 --> 37:20.830
(speaking Vietnamese)

37:34.452 --> 37:35.919
I don't understand.

37:57.074 --> 37:59.065
Thanks.

38:09.253 --> 38:11.551
I... I don't understand.

38:14.358 --> 38:16.758
I don't know what you're saying.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.319
I... I don't understand.

38:23.434 --> 38:25.698
Agriculture.

38:25.736 --> 38:27.328
You're with agriculture.

38:29.573 --> 38:31.973
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with the flight crew.

38:32.009 --> 38:35.376
But I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.850
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm not in charge here.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.375
I'm trying to find out
what happened to the ship.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.718
S-ship.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.518
Ship.

38:46.557 --> 38:49.151
I'm on my way to the reactor.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.888
Reactor.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.953
Reactor, that's right.
Exactly right.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.795
But that doesn't concern you.
You stay here.

38:55.833 --> 39:00.270
You stay put and wait for the...

39:01.939 --> 39:04.908
security to reengage.

39:04.942 --> 39:08.708
And I'm gonna handle this problem.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.270
Okay?

39:15.986 --> 39:18.045
(electricity crackling)

39:22.593 --> 39:24.788
(grunting)

39:28.232 --> 39:30.166
(groans)

39:32.103 --> 39:35.072
(panting)
God damn it.

39:36.741 --> 39:39.039
(clanking)

39:48.052 --> 39:50.885
Who's there?

39:53.124 --> 39:55.149
(roars)

39:55.192 --> 39:57.592
(clanking)

39:57.628 --> 40:00.495
Identify yourself.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.658
Bower?

40:02.700 --> 40:05.294
Is that you, Bower?

40:07.805 --> 40:09.796
That can't be you.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.967
- (shouts)
- (grunts)

41:28.886 --> 41:30.615
(groans)

41:33.257 --> 41:34.952
You again.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.171
(pulsates)

42:03.187 --> 42:06.987
I understand that it's felt

42:07.024 --> 42:09.424
like every man for himself.

42:09.460 --> 42:13.328
If we're going to get out of this...

42:13.364 --> 42:17.528
a little fucking solidarity

42:17.568 --> 42:20.036
goes a long way.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.976
We all want to survive,

42:26.010 --> 42:28.376
right?

42:28.412 --> 42:30.846
I lost contact with my CO.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.714
So I need someone to tell me
how to get to the reactor.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.487
You know?
That's great.

42:39.523 --> 42:42.390
All right, we can work together

42:42.426 --> 42:44.690
as a team.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.993
(roaring)

42:48.032 --> 42:49.966
(speaking Vietnamese)

42:54.138 --> 42:55.901
Go.

43:00.811 --> 43:03.279
(speaking Vietnamese)

43:04.982 --> 43:06.415
Yeah.

43:13.557 --> 43:15.718
Yeah well, no sympathy here, pal.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.989
She left me with
a few sore spots too.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.356
Why the hell should I trust you?

43:22.399 --> 43:26.165
- Listen, lady, we don't want any...
- Are you really part of the flight crew?

43:26.203 --> 43:28.967
Corporal Bower,
ship's mechanical engineer.

43:35.746 --> 43:38.476
I didn't think
there was any flight crew left.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.908
What's happened to us?

43:41.952 --> 43:44.284
A malfunction of some sort.

43:44.321 --> 43:47.722
You think?
What's your plan?

43:47.758 --> 43:50.318
Fire up the reactor.
Go from there.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.488
- You just wake up?
- Yeah.

43:52.529 --> 43:55.362
- Just joined the party.
- You'll never make it.

43:55.399 --> 43:57.993
- Why is that?
- You're going the wrong direction.

43:59.837 --> 44:01.634
- Wait a second.
- Keep it down.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.606
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.109
- I need you to show me the way.
- To the reactor?

44:06.143 --> 44:08.304
I don't like going that far down.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.809
No one ever comes back.

44:12.850 --> 44:16.081
We don't have much time.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.953
We could lose everything onboard.
Do you know what I'm saying to you?

44:18.989 --> 44:21.116
Can you fly it?

44:21.158 --> 44:24.025
Can you fly the ship?

44:24.061 --> 44:25.551
Land it if you have to?

44:28.098 --> 44:29.895
Yeah.

44:34.705 --> 44:36.536
How long have you been awake?

44:36.573 --> 44:39.599
Don't know.
There's no way to tell time in here.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.611
- Five, maybe six months.
- Months?

44:41.645 --> 44:44.273
Quiet.
You want to get us killed?

44:44.314 --> 44:46.077
(roaring in distance)

44:48.285 --> 44:50.150
What are we doing?

44:50.187 --> 44:53.247
- We are waiting.
- Waiting for what?

44:55.959 --> 44:59.395
You want to get to the reactor?
Then trust me.

44:59.430 --> 45:01.762
(speaking Vietnamese)

45:03.400 --> 45:05.368
(roaring in distance)

45:05.402 --> 45:09.031
Oh shit.
Hey, we have to go.

45:09.073 --> 45:10.631
Trust me.

45:10.674 --> 45:12.801
We've got to go now.

45:12.843 --> 45:15.676
- We've got to go now.
- Wait.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.510
- (roaring louder)
- We've got to go now.

45:22.853 --> 45:25.151
(rumbling)

45:42.673 --> 45:44.538
What the hell are they?

45:44.575 --> 45:46.975
Never quite felt like sticking
around to find out.

45:47.010 --> 45:49.604
Running is always the best option.

45:49.646 --> 45:51.546
They can't be from this ship.

45:59.223 --> 46:00.781
What is all this?

46:00.824 --> 46:02.883
Ecological development.

46:02.926 --> 46:06.293
Embryonic charter, livestock
and wildlife repopulation.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.766
You live here?
You protect all this?

46:11.468 --> 46:13.333
To us it seemed worth protecting.

46:13.370 --> 46:15.031
Us?

46:16.473 --> 46:18.839
When I woke up,
there were five if us.

46:20.144 --> 46:23.170
I was part of the Brandenburg Institute's
genetic sampling team.

46:23.213 --> 46:26.376
Seven years collecting
and readying earth's biosphere...

46:26.416 --> 46:29.442
just didn't feel right handing it off.

46:31.321 --> 46:34.518
I volunteered to go along with it.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.427
This...

46:41.465 --> 46:43.626
truly is Noah's Ark.

46:43.667 --> 46:47.865
This archive holds the world
we are going to live in.

46:47.905 --> 46:51.671
We've already lost about
30% of the specimens.

46:52.776 --> 46:56.075
The lab has its own generator,
but without the reactor working,

46:56.113 --> 46:58.775
I don't know if they
will ever make it to Tanis.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.716
Tanis.

47:00.751 --> 47:03.242
You couldn't remember?

47:03.287 --> 47:05.346
I couldn't remember how...

47:05.389 --> 47:07.823
how far away it was.

47:07.858 --> 47:10.588
This was a 123-year flight.

47:10.627 --> 47:12.754
Consider yourself lucky.

47:12.796 --> 47:15.390
It took me months to recall.

47:15.432 --> 47:18.026
It took even longer to get
that goddamn door open.

47:18.068 --> 47:20.969
It comes on in pieces.

47:22.206 --> 47:25.073
I know everything about this vault
and its systems.

47:26.376 --> 47:28.810
But I still can't remember
where I grew up...

47:30.681 --> 47:32.774
or my brother's name.

47:32.816 --> 47:35.910
Are you hungry?

47:35.953 --> 47:37.944
Yeah, I'm starving.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.050
Here.

47:44.094 --> 47:46.494
Good for protein.

47:59.910 --> 48:03.004
How could we become like this
in only eight years?

48:03.046 --> 48:06.709
This ship was built to outlast
our children's children.

48:07.851 --> 48:11.685
I think we've been asleep
longer than you think.

48:13.690 --> 48:15.658
(clanging)

48:40.050 --> 48:42.041
You want in?

48:42.085 --> 48:43.382
Come and get it, you fuck!

48:55.699 --> 48:58.759
Help!
Help me!

49:00.837 --> 49:02.532
Help!

49:14.584 --> 49:17.144
Who the hell are you?

49:17.187 --> 49:19.155
I'm part of the flight crew.

49:19.189 --> 49:21.555
Please help me.

49:21.591 --> 49:23.525
You're all right.
You're all right. Easy.

49:23.560 --> 49:26.495
- (whimpering)
- Hey, hang on.

49:26.530 --> 49:28.555
Hang on.
Who are you?

49:28.598 --> 49:32.090
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

49:34.104 --> 49:36.334
Gallo.

49:36.373 --> 49:39.501
Gallo? Is that it?

49:39.543 --> 49:42.512
Corporal Gallo?

49:42.546 --> 49:45.777
Yes.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.443
Where'd you come from, Gallo?

49:47.484 --> 49:49.384
From the...

49:49.419 --> 49:51.444
from the bridge.

49:51.488 --> 49:54.855
Bridge?
What happened?

49:54.891 --> 49:57.519
Where are we?
Can you tell me?

49:57.561 --> 50:00.462
- (whimpering)
- Corporal.

50:01.498 --> 50:05.025
Tell me.
What happened?

50:18.115 --> 50:19.707
Bowen:
Where are we?

50:19.750 --> 50:22.378
Hypersleep chamber,
personnel.

50:26.790 --> 50:28.917
Careful.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.253
And don't slow me down.

50:43.006 --> 50:44.940
Bower:
Most of these are empty.

50:44.975 --> 50:46.465
Where the hell is everyone?

50:46.510 --> 50:48.478
This is their main
hunting ground.

50:50.714 --> 50:52.341
Keep moving.

50:58.088 --> 51:01.683
Hey, my wife could be in here.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.853
She's a development settler?
Engineer?

51:06.363 --> 51:09.764
No, she's not part of the crew.
But spouses were brought with.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.199
She's not here then.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.759
Do you know where
the family members are?

51:13.804 --> 51:15.499
Quiet.

51:26.550 --> 51:28.381
We have to keep moving.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.649
We don't want to stay
in the open for too long.

51:31.688 --> 51:34.156
Especially in here.

51:40.931 --> 51:41.989
We have to get going.

51:48.138 --> 51:49.571
We can't just leave him.

51:49.606 --> 51:51.665
Fuck that.
He's hunting.

51:51.708 --> 51:53.972
You wait for him?
Good luck.

51:56.613 --> 51:58.376
Wait.

51:58.415 --> 52:01.248
(metal creaking)

52:01.284 --> 52:02.774
(gasps)

52:13.597 --> 52:15.224
(metal creaks)

52:18.135 --> 52:20.433
(sputtering)

52:20.470 --> 52:22.700
You all right?

52:24.407 --> 52:26.398
I'm all right.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.072
(gagging)
Oh God.

52:36.887 --> 52:38.980
There must be hundreds
of them in here.

52:40.123 --> 52:42.091
(roaring)

52:44.628 --> 52:46.596
(rumbling)

53:17.861 --> 53:20.022
Where did they go?

53:22.832 --> 53:24.322
We have to get out of here.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.039
- (roaring)
- (gasps)

53:47.457 --> 53:49.118
(roaring)

54:15.418 --> 54:18.353
- (roaring)
- (groans)

54:18.388 --> 54:19.980
(shouting)

54:48.685 --> 54:50.550
(shouts)

54:59.062 --> 55:00.825
(groans)

55:15.445 --> 55:18.005
- (shouts)
- (roars)

55:23.753 --> 55:25.584
(roaring)

55:59.422 --> 56:01.583
(growling)

56:07.330 --> 56:09.525
(bangs)

56:09.566 --> 56:11.557
We should run.

56:14.838 --> 56:17.170
- (roars)
- Go!

57:04.788 --> 57:06.221
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave him.

57:08.658 --> 57:10.683
(screaming)

57:18.401 --> 57:20.892
(roars)

57:23.239 --> 57:25.037
Bower, do you copy?

57:28.878 --> 57:30.311
You out there?

58:03.279 --> 58:05.941
Flight team 4.

58:05.982 --> 58:07.813
What are you doing?

58:07.851 --> 58:09.318
Just checking you.

58:09.352 --> 58:11.081
For what?

58:11.120 --> 58:13.680
Make sure you're okay.
You passed out.

58:13.723 --> 58:15.554
You were hysterical.

58:15.592 --> 58:18.891
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Payton.

58:18.928 --> 58:21.988
- Lieutenant Payton.
- You're a lieutenant?

58:22.031 --> 58:24.192
You're team 4.

58:24.234 --> 58:26.065
You're supposed
to be my predecessor.

58:28.404 --> 58:31.601
You said you came from the bridge.

58:31.641 --> 58:34.041
- Yeah, so?
- So where the hell are we?

58:34.077 --> 58:36.739
- I can't get any navigation in here.
- I don't know.

58:36.779 --> 58:39.373
Well, what did you see?
How did this whole thing get screwed up?

58:39.415 --> 58:42.942
Listen, I am not a navigator.

58:42.986 --> 58:45.784
- The stars all look alike.
- Take it easy, all right?

58:45.822 --> 58:48.552
Just want to make sure you're okay.

58:48.591 --> 58:50.957
- I'm fine.
- Is that your blood, Corporal?

58:53.596 --> 58:57.191
Some of it is, sir.

58:57.233 --> 58:59.963
Who else's blood is it?

59:00.003 --> 59:02.233
There was something
wrong with them.

59:02.272 --> 59:04.866
Something wrong with who?

59:04.908 --> 59:07.433
Your crew?

59:07.477 --> 59:10.071
It was pandorum.

59:10.113 --> 59:12.946
I had to defend myself.

59:12.982 --> 59:14.950
I did.

59:14.984 --> 59:18.249
Pandorum?
Both of 'em?

59:18.288 --> 59:20.984
You don't believe me, do you?

59:22.959 --> 59:26.019
If you would have seen them...

59:28.131 --> 59:32.001
you would have done
the same thing, sir.

59:33.836 --> 59:36.236
(water splashing)

59:41.644 --> 59:43.544
I thought you knew
where we were going.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.572
I was trying to save our asses.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.447
(speaking Vietnamese)

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.700
(roaring in distance)

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.651
(speaks Vietnamese)

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.287
Whoa whoa, easy, okay?

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.297
No weapons.
No weapons.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.567
Excuse me.
Just please, come.

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:43.470
Come in.
Okay.

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:47.033
Please, make yourselves at home.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.241
You live here?

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.577
- Who said that? What?
- You live here?

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:55.982
I know it's not much to look at.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.453
But...

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.319
they can't get in here

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.017
unless I want them to.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.423
Why would you want them to?

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.859
I had no idea
there was any crew left.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.921
Have you met any other flyers?

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.694
No.

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.500
Not in a long long time.

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.939
Why don't you come on
down so we can meet properly?

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.944
You think I survived this long
trusting strangers?

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.411
Wait.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.109
I have a question for you.
Where you got to be?

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.382
Reactor bay.
Know how to get there?

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.480
Yeah, I do.

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.824
Why would you want
to go to the reactor?

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.658
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.155
You just woke up, huh?
You hungry?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.498
'Cause I can cook.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.300
I really got a treat for you guys.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:52.671
but I must admit it's really
difficult to season

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.700
when you're only using
a motor oil base.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.804
But if we use our imagination,

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.247
we got something here.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.251
It kinda tastes like...

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:04.185
(sniffs)

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.279
herb and butter dogshit.

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:08.517
How long have you been awake?

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.856
Let me see... what's today?

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.123
Tuesday, so I have no idea.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.327
Ah, well, let's eat, shall we?

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:24.032
(speaks Vietnamese)
It's kosher.

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:27.304
I'm a cook, you know.
Says so right here on my tattoo.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.173
Is that safe?

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.182
Compared to what?

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.582
Those things out there,

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:38.246
could it have been something

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:41.848
that crawled out of your tank or lab
or something?

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.882
No, that's not possible.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:48.519
Then it's some kind of life form
that got onboard.

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:50.225
Or something.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.325
Or something
that was already onboard

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.563
with us in the hyperbunks.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.504
What do you mean?

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:59.531
I believe it's the accelerator.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:02.635
The synthetic enzyme
in our feeding tubes

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.771
that would help our bodies
adjust and adapt

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.714
to the environmental
conditions on Tanis.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:09.547
From what I've seen,

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:13.021
these things have adapted
to the ship instead.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:18.182
So you're saying that they're passengers
who have mutated?

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:21.025
That stuff in our blood is supposed
to jump-start evolution.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:24.191
Well, why would they
be affected and we're not?

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:27.259
Maybe they've been awake
much longer than we think.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.272
- Longer than him.
- Huh.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.274
- You don't know what happened to us?
- You do?

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.766
Oh, I've been around
for a while.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.915
I know what I've seen.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.548
What do you think you're doing?

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.253
What is that?

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:54.058
It's just a sedative
to help you relax.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.724
Then you take it
and relax.

01:03:56.766 --> 01:04:00.429
Take it down a notch.
We're on the same team here.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.132
Do you know
the symptoms of pandorum?

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.368
- What?
- Orbital dysfunctional syndrome.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.104
- Pandorum.
- I've seen it before.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.738
Ever witness
the symptoms firsthand?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.839
It's not something
you can easily detect.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.350
It starts with a shiver, an itch,

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.215
a slow boil...

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:20.313
the biological side effects
of flying deep space

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.914
feeding into paranoia.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.483
And the paranoid
brain feeding the side effects.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.189
A downward spiral.
A descent into madness.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.563
There is no shutting off the heat
no matter what you do.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.194
It'll boil over.

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.363
You don't believe me.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.770
I didn't say that.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:40.537
How could they both have had it?
The odds are insurmountable.

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.441
I wasn't about
to question your actions.

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.946
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.211
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.083
- It has an emotional trigger effect.
- That's what they say.

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:53.850
How do you think you would react
if you knew the truth?

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:00.286
The truth about what?

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:03.196
Leland: Boom.
Oh, how the whole world cheered

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.258
to the thunder of earth's
mightiest creation...

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:07.860
Elysium.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.168
One small spark

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.107
to ignite the heavens
for the heroes

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.406
to venture farther and farther

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.140
than any of mankind's machines.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.149
And we slept.
We slept a slumber so deep

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.946
that no one had dared before

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:26.921
as three little Indians
were left to mind the store.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:28.480
Gallo:
We were only into our second term.

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:29.752
All flight systems nominal.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.522
I picked up symptoms
with my CO and 2nd lieutenant.

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:36.395
Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought
would become a problem.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.799
- Until we got the transmission.
- What transmission?

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:42.326
Leland:
Mother Earth's final call.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:46.535
All God's creation ending
with mere words of encouragement.

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.942
(garbled talking)

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.475
What does it say?

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.824
You're all that's left of us.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:16.226
Good luck.
God bless.

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.866
And Godspeed.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.274
Earth...

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.874
is gone?

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:28.042
Poof.
Wiped away.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.951
We ran a full sweep of the grid
and they were gone.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.785
One day there,
the next nothing.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.984
In one day?

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:38.653
It had to be nuclear
or an asteroid.

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.184
Does it matter?

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.663
My fellow crew members
didn't take the news too well.

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:45.724
I wanted to wake the primary crew,

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:48.293
but my 2nd lieutenant
was already over the edge.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:51.738
Leland: Three little Indians
with the burden to bear.

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:54.140
No more law.
Nothing left to care.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.771
Just three little souls whose
destiny had become undone

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:01.840
because there was
chop chop chop chop...

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.215
then there was only one.

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.779
One little Indian left.

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.757
They were my commanding officers,

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.090
men who had guided me
through FT.

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:15.256
But it wasn't them anymore.
They were gone.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:18.164
- I had no choice!
- Corporal Gallo!

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.931
Leland: One little Indian left,
alone with all his doom.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.769
He refuses to go to bed,
so what does he do?

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:28.743
He decides to stay up
and play in his room.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.372
What nasty little games
he would play

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.348
with his slumbering prey.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.748
He was slayer, he was master.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:38.652
He was both God and the devil.

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:41.622
See, that's what some would say.
He would grow to manhood,

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:43.682
- a self-proclaimed king.
- (coughing)

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.389
Master of his own vessel.
Home to his own sin.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.331
He just cast out
all who had behaved.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:53.802
Just exiled to the cargo hold

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.633
- to fend amongst themselves...
- (coughing)

01:07:55.671 --> 01:08:00.005
...and scavenge,
feeding off their own.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.306
Evil grew.

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:05.802
The king no longer wanted to play.

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:09.340
So he returned
to his bed of slumber.

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.945
And while the king slept,

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:14.979
a whole new world of evil grew

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.752
as we wept.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.488
Gallo's voice:
It starts with a shiver, an itch.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.656
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.962
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.161
It has an emotional trigger effect.

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.572
(rumbling)

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.553
(chains rattling)

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.767
- (machinery humming)
- (grunting)

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.170
What are you doing?

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.184
He's gonna fucking eat us.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.482
It's not personal, guys.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.252
It's just survival of the fittest.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:26.091
Or maybe it's the brightest.

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:28.288
You understand what I'm saying?

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.390
- You gassed us.
- Oh, yes.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.196
And I'm sorry,
but I'm a little too old

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:35.760
and too tired for the honorable way
of hunting game.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:39.399
You better make sure I'm dead...

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:42.569
(shouting in Vietnamese)

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:45.808
You don't have to do this.
We have to save the ship.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:49.578
Don't sweat it
and save me the speeches.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.416
I wouldn't have survived this long
if I had a heart.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:57.553
You know, a strange thing,
the survival instinct.

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:01.393
I mean, there's nothing really left
to live for.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.991
Don't be fucking stupid.
I can save the fucking ship.

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:12.639
Question is,
what would be more stupid?

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:15.166
Trusting the ship will hold
to see another day

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.510
when it's kept me alive
for all these years?

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.674
Or trusting somebody

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.843
who's desperate enough
to say anything

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.116
just when I'm about to carve
a steak out of his girlfriend?

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.747
Listen to the ship.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.589
What about the ship?

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.460
The power surges...

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.591
the reactor is in its final stage.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.762
We have less time than I thought.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:45.740
The final phase before shutdown,

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:48.140
before we lose everything

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.611
and everyone onboard.

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:54.548
If we don't reset it now,

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:57.814
everything is lost.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:02.119
She has been all moody lately.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.682
Very moody.

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.423
Hey, listen.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.954
Hey, I get it.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.560
What? You get what?

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:16.799
You did what you had to do.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:20.502
You made it.
No one's gonna judge you.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:23.067
No one's gonna judge you.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.580
You are a survivor.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:30.416
And right now we...

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:33.319
have to reset the reactor.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:42.230
How long before the ship dies?

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:43.959
The truth.

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.661
I don't know.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.466
Take a fucking guess.

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.906
An hour. Less.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.289
- Well?
- We're in this together.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.622
I need your radio.
We don't have much time.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.891
Bower:
Payton, do you copy?

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.526
Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:23.697
Payton, do you copy?
Can you hear me?

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.934
I'm here.
Where are you?

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.738
Storage tank
somewhere below B level.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.302
Midship sector 12, I think.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.941
How the hell did you get all the way
to the other side of the ship?

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.973
The reactor is shutting down fast.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.010
I need you to access the memory banks
from the last power surge

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:42.285
- and run a Kolzer complex test.
- Accessing memory banks now.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:44.383
Running Kolzer complex.

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.598
You're not gonna like this.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.898
Test says you have
less than 47 minutes

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.064
before complete system failure.

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:59.734
- That's not much time.
- How do we get you in there?

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:02.175
- I need you to give us a path.
- Copy.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.407
Move it.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:31.098
(screeches)

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.343
No. It's a child.

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.868
Child?
That's no fucking child.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.938
(screeching)

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.014
They are breeding.

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:49.319
Little bastard.
He went and got daddy.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.292
(roars)

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.302
This is not gonna work.
There's too many of them.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.864
We must be close
to where they live.

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:09.639
Great.
Now we're fucking stuck here.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.575
Gallo: What's so important
on the other side of that door?

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:17.107
The bridge.
We can take control of guidance

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.551
as soon as we get on the bridge.

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:21.147
How's that going to help?
This ship is dying.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.715
We should be focusing
on how to save ourselves.

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:26.853
Oh, that's right.
The Boy Scout is going to save us.

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.795
He can do it.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.663
24 hours ago
he didn't know his own name.

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:36.569
Now you think he's ready
to reconfigure

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.937
a nuclear reactor?

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.135
Leland:
If they don't leave soon,

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:43.235
there's no point in even going.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.311
What are you doing?

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.942
These are our families

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.452
from flight personnel.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.684
They're all dead.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.951
You think she's here?

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.461
No, she's...

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.293
she's not here.

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.890
How do you know for sure?

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:08.198
'Cause she wouldn't come with me.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:20.472
She's not on this flight.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.541
She left me.

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.643
(wind howling)

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.127
There was nothing left for me,

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.103
so I enlisted.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:46.073
She's the reason why I left.

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:51.012
Well, then she saved your life.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.537
That's very tragic.

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:56.517
But we've got to move on.
I'm sick of this shit.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:57.849
- For what?
- What?

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.683
- For what?
- Shh.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.746
- They're all gone.
- Shh.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.226
- There's nothing left.
- Shh! Shut your fucking mouth.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.524
There's nothing left to go back to.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.963
You're wrong.

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:12.933
Hey, we were meant to go on.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:17.700
And we were meant to survive.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.764
And now it's more
important than ever.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.799
Leland:
We're wasting time.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:24.368
- I remember.
- What?

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:28.645
Clock's ticking.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:35.690
Payton's wife Marianne.

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.359
I remember.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.636
Bower was right about one thing:

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:52.003
Once this thing shuts down
we are as good as dead.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.201
What are you muttering about?

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:57.678
I'm saying once it's done
we're done.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:00.045
But we still have a way out of this.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:03.245
You're suggesting what, Corporal?

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.446
We can launch ourselves in the pods

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:08.888
before the ignition systems
are completely dead, sir.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:11.017
That's suicide.

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.458
We can buy a few days,

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.485
which is better
than what we have left here.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.765
Leland:
The reactor is close.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.269
You can hear it breathe.

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:38.579
Yeah, this is it...

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.915
a descent into hell itself.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.802
How long do you think that reactor
has been sitting there, huh?

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.365
That thing could melt down

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.071
when he tries to fire the core.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.143
This ship could be ripped in half.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:10.549
Stand down, Corporal.
We are not abandoning anything

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.780
and we are not leaving them behind.

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:15.688
We can't stay on this ship!
You know that!

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:18.591
I said stand down, Corporal!

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:21.723
That's an order.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.100
(electricity crackling)

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.577
- Whoa!
- (metal creaks)

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.291
(growling)

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.554
Christ Almighty.

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.646
(grunts)

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:25.416
Don't let go.

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.593
(beeping)

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.554
He's in.

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.432
We're gonna get ourselves
out of this.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.096
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:12.163
How can I trust someone who
isn't even honest with himself?

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.767
We still have time.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.711
- You have to listen to me.
- Don't do that.

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.441
Don't do what?

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.814
Don't talk to me like I'm some child
that needs reassurance.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.443
Then calm the fuck down.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.512
I know this ship and I know what
she's capable of better than anyone.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:31.117
I know what she can and can't do.
Why are we even arguing?

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.389
If you want to stay here
to die that is your choice.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:36.727
- I gave you an order.
- Not mine. Not mine!

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.232
Corporal.

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:40.234
Who's the one being
irrational here, Lieutenant?

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.361
Who's the one being delusional?

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:45.202
I'm getting off this ship.
The flight is over.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.571
Over!

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.579
(speaking Vietnamese)

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.155
(growling)

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.997
- Don't shoot yourself into space.
- Shut up.

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.768
- I'm getting off this ship.
- Bower's going to reboot the reactor.

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.502
Shut up.

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:58.402
It wasn't the crew
that was sick, was it?

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.471
- Finish the code.
- Look at yourself.

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:03.382
- You're the one with the symptoms.
- Finish it!

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.984
(pod humming)

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.090
What are you doing?

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.069
It's for your own good.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.367
What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.340
You're not well.

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.899
You just need the proper treatment.

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:34.146
Let me out, God damn it!

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:37.674
Open it!
That is an order, motherfucker!

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.711
It's not your fault.

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:44.247
I will cut you to fucking bits.
Open it!

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.123
Open it!
I will carve you up!

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.561
Your mind has turned
against itself.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:51.030
You're killing us!

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:53.364
We are all going to die, Corporal.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:06.371
Holy fuck.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.462
(straining)

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:53.860
- Oh, shit.
- (clanking)

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.920
(roars)

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:03.930
(roaring)

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.014
(shouts in Vietnamese)

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.323
(roars)

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.213
They're coming.

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:03.290
Hurry up!

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.559
Shit.

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:06.829
(howls)

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.298
Come on, come on, come on.

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.773
(humming loudly)

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:31.282
(computers powering up)

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:43.164
He did it.
Boy Scout did it.

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:46.139
You were right.
Now let me out.

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:48.540
I can help.

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.567
I'll help you.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:56.009
What are you doing?

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.177
Are you still trying
to get on the bridge?

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.514
You do not want
to go in there, Corporal.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:06.125
What are you gonna tell them, huh?

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:09.130
- Bower will be coming back here.
- Shut up.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.029
They'll know what you did.

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:13.363
(laughs)

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.027
(creatures roaring)

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:45.399
(growling)

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:52.071
(roars)

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:53.698
(shouts)

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:00.611
(screams)

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.225
Where do you think you're going?

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.888
Quiet.

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:17.261
Think about what you're doing, sir.

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:21.266
Shut the fuck up.

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:25.029
They will never let you
get away with this.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.335
Shut up!

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.156
They're everywhere.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:09.878
Asshole!

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.689
(screaming)

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:42.141
(groans)

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:51.987
(cooing)

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:56.354
(grunts)

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:02.093
- (screeches)
- (gurgles)

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.199
(door bangs)

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.446
We both know who needs this shot.

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:16.746
- Stay back.
- Who's the one suffering here, sir?

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.217
I mean it!

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.612
What do you want from me?

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:27.257
Your mind has turned against itself.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:32.898
I'm gonna fucking carve you up.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.969
(both grunting)

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.472
Who are you?

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.290
Leland:
Ahem. Made it.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:05.595
Whoo.

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.464
I was with your boy.

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:10.994
I helped him get all this started.

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:12.733
I see you're a flyer too.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.674
(groans)

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.978
(pounding at door)

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.758
Ah.

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:01.418
Where's your lieutenant?

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.515
He's not my lieutenant.

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:19.404
Where are we?

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.032
What's happened to us?

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:23.635
The flight log

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:26.772
will tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone.

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.985
(gasps)

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.957
It seems

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:47.126
my mild memory lapse

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.261
has finally worn off, Lieutenant.

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.328
Who the hell are you?

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:54.671
Gallo, Corporal.

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:57.200
I was younger than you
when I first came onboard.

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:01.181
Funny, I can't even remember what life
was like before this flight began.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.080
It's all I have.

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.780
You're the one who received
the final transmission.

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.516
You stayed awake.
You broke the rotation.

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.717
You killed your crew.

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:13.886
How the hell would you know that?

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.896
Where are we?

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.993
Go ahead, take a peek.

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.299
(metal grinding)

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.940
You tell me.

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.477
What have you done with us?

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.316
You don't get it, kid.

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.584
There's no one left to judge.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:46.184
Where are the stars?
Oh my God.

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:48.627
God?
You think God survived?

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:51.154
He's dead along with
the rest of humanity.

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.063
There's no law or order,

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.795
no good or evil.
Just us.

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:58.327
And you think you're going
to be the one to judge me?

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.634
You want to take a shot at me?

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.335
You know what?
I just might.

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.808
You are suffering, son.

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:06.404
I can see it in your face.
I've been there.

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:09.007
Just imagine just for a minute,

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.110
imagine yourself without the chains
of your morality.

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.087
You'd even surprise yourself.

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:15.952
It's the ultimate freedom.

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.924
No.

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:20.086
This isn't freedom.

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:22.118
This is pandorum.

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:25.963
Oh, pandorum. Pandorum isn't
what they warned us about.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.025
I know it's frightening at first,
terrifying in fact.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:30.867
Isn't that what you're feeling right now,
terrible fear?

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:34.500
Let go and on the other side
of it is divine clarity.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.203
Purity.
Enlightenment.

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.211
Shut up!
What's out there?

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.873
You are resisting what is.

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.816
You have to let go of
your petty concept of reality.

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:46.012
That's just baggage
from the old world.

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.749
And we both know that didn't work
out very well now, did it?

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:52.691
They fucked up our planet.
Life eats life.

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:55.958
And all that's left is what is.

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:58.056
This ship is a seed

01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:00.659
from which we can create a new world.

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:01.861
Shut up!
What's out there?!

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.665
A new world.
A natural state.

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:05.899
- Raw, beautiful...
- What do you see?

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.137
...perfect.
I am offering you the kingdom.

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.804
- (banging)
- And all that's holding you back

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.507
is your own fear.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.684
Still the Boy Scout,
hey, kid?

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:20.278
There will always be law

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.915
and you will pay
for what you've done.

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:26.688
Even if that means I have
to pull the sick out of you.

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:29.560
(gagging, groaning)

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:31.428
- Bower!
- What is it?

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.062
(groans)

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.576
(high-pitched whining)

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.847
(both gasp)

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:55.579
We've already crashed.

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:59.286
We've been on Tanis
all this time.

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.786
All this time.

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.497
I guess this thing
does land itself.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:11.505
Doesn't float too well though,
does it?

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:18.139
Let go of your fear.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:21.974
This is where I'll push through.

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:27.977
Shh shh.

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.922
They're coming in.

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:32.016
(pounding)

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.290
Attaboy.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.325
(gasping)

01:36:17.905 --> 01:36:20.169
They're coming in.

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:22.937
What are you doing?

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:33.344
Why don't you shoot?

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.020
(cracking)

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.728
(metal groaning)

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.621
(alarm sounding)

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:32.405
Are you crazy?

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:41.782
- Do you see that?
- Fuck him.

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.847
- We need to get out of here.
- Hold on.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:46.951
Not like this.
We can't die like this.

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.427
Hold on.

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:55.064
(growls)

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.679
(gasping)

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:20.259
(gasping)

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.962
What?
No, I can't...

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:28.730
Just breathe.

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:18.751
(coughing)

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:31.389
(coughs)

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:36.099
Hey. Hey.

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.166
Just breathe.

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:49.108
It's safe to wake up now.

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:29.281
(instrumental music playing)

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:30.282
