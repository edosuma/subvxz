00:08.525 --> 00:10.117
Will the defendant please rise?

00:15.532 --> 00:17.967
In the matter of
The People vs. Stanley Coe...

00:17.967 --> 00:19.169
having found the defendant...

00:19.169 --> 00:22.572
guilty of the murder
of Nicholas Janus...

00:22.572 --> 00:23.840
the jury has recommended...

00:23.840 --> 00:25.675
that you not receive
the death penalty.

00:25.675 --> 00:28.511
Given the mitigating factors
in your case...

00:28.511 --> 00:29.779
it is the order of this court...

00:29.779 --> 00:32.148
that you serve
no less than 15 years...

00:32.148 --> 00:34.384
and no more
than the term of your life.

00:34.384 --> 00:36.019
Case closed.
Jury is dismissed.

00:36.019 --> 00:39.923
No! That son of a bitch
killed my husband.

00:39.923 --> 00:41.891
You don't deserve to live.

00:41.891 --> 00:44.086
This isn't justice.
It's a joke.

00:45.528 --> 00:47.897
Born into a life
of wealth and privilege...

00:47.897 --> 00:51.301
Laurel Janus has always gotten
exactly what she wants.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.236
But with the murder
of her husband...

00:53.236 --> 00:56.039
Laurel's life of luxury
has been shattered.

00:56.039 --> 01:00.276
Now, all she wants
is to see justice done...

01:00.276 --> 01:04.247
a justice
that can only be found...

01:04.247 --> 01:06.306
in The Twilight Zone.

01:07.717 --> 01:08.918
How could you blow it
like this?

01:08.918 --> 01:10.453
What kind of
a D.A. are you, Lew?

01:10.453 --> 01:11.654
I know it's not
what you were hoping for...

01:11.654 --> 01:13.790
but I did the best I could
with the evidence I had.

01:13.790 --> 01:15.391
Great. So Nick
had his brains bashed in...

01:15.391 --> 01:17.393
and Coe gets free meals,
pay-per-view.

01:17.393 --> 01:19.195
Who knows? Maybe he'll
even write his memoirs.

01:19.195 --> 01:21.531
Laurel, it's over. You won.

01:21.531 --> 01:23.533
You've got my card, Laurel.

01:23.533 --> 01:24.898
If you need anything,
just call me. OK?

01:27.137 --> 01:29.739
My husband's things.
When can I have them back?

01:29.739 --> 01:30.940
Well, that's hard to say.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.375
It's not exactly
proper procedure.

01:32.375 --> 01:33.777
I'm not asking for the evidence.

01:33.777 --> 01:35.578
I just want the things
he wore that night.

01:35.578 --> 01:36.772
Please, Lew.

01:37.781 --> 01:38.975
OK.

01:41.751 --> 01:42.986
Let me drive you home.

01:42.986 --> 01:45.355
Come on. You know me.
I'm a pillar of strength.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.824
Uh-huh. We can get your car
in the morning.

01:47.824 --> 01:49.159
I'm fine, Becca. Really.

01:49.159 --> 01:50.460
Are you sure?

01:50.460 --> 01:53.463
Hey, I've been clean for
sixteen weeks and three days.

01:53.463 --> 01:54.864
No pills, no booze.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.833
God knows I've been tempted.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.468
OK, well, you call me
the minute you get home.

01:58.468 --> 02:00.603
Yes, Mother.

02:00.603 --> 02:02.906
Becca.

02:02.906 --> 02:04.140
Thanks for being there.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.199
What are mothers for!

04:02.292 --> 04:03.691
Nick?

04:17.005 --> 04:20.843
You're traveling
to another dimension.

04:20.843 --> 04:26.577
A dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind.

04:27.784 --> 04:31.020
A journey
into a wondrous land...

04:31.020 --> 04:35.286
whose boundaries are only
that of the imagination.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.455
You're entering...

04:56.145 --> 04:58.815
Becca,
I know what it sounds like.

04:58.815 --> 05:02.385
I hardly believe it myself,
but he was there...

05:02.385 --> 05:05.154
staring back at me
in the rearview mirror.

05:05.154 --> 05:07.290
Well, I don't see anything now.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.558
Yeah, I know.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.526
When I took the glasses off,
he was gone.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.756
I've tried
again and again, but...

05:14.998 --> 05:17.200
Look, before you ship me
back to detox...

05:17.200 --> 05:19.936
check the house.
Check the medicine cabinet.

05:19.936 --> 05:21.738
Check all
my favorite hiding places.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.574
I only wish I had been wasted.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.442
Laurel, you've been
through hell for two years.

05:26.442 --> 05:27.777
It's no wonder
you're seeing things.

05:27.777 --> 05:33.116
It was just so freaky...

05:33.116 --> 05:35.785
Iike I was seeing the world
through Nick's eyes.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.719
But you know
that's not possible.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.727
I miss him. I really miss him.

05:44.727 --> 05:46.095
I know.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.664
Every time I fell apart...

05:48.664 --> 05:50.427
Nick was there
to put me back together.

05:51.968 --> 05:55.338
I just wanted to give him
the justice he deserved.

05:55.338 --> 05:57.507
Do me a favor.

05:57.507 --> 06:00.376
Do yourself a favor.
All these clippings...

06:00.376 --> 06:01.577
and all these papers
on the wall...

06:01.577 --> 06:03.179
get rid of them...

06:03.179 --> 06:05.982
and Nick's things--

06:05.982 --> 06:08.917
Throw them out.
It's time to move on.

08:58.054 --> 08:59.487
Nick.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.436
-Nick.
-Oh, jeez, Stan.

09:13.436 --> 09:14.937
What the hell are you
doing here?

09:14.937 --> 09:16.806
Waiting to talk
to my ex-partner...

09:16.806 --> 09:18.474
who hasn't been
answering my calls.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.576
Oh, really? Sorry about that.

09:20.576 --> 09:21.877
I haven't been checking
my messages.

09:21.877 --> 09:24.072
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:06.155 --> 10:08.224
And I want an answer,
damn it!

10:08.224 --> 10:10.760
OK, listen, Stan,
I've been jammed.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.261
I had to check
Laurel into rehab again.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.496
She keeps leaving on her own.

10:13.496 --> 10:15.131
Hey! That's your problem,
not mine!

10:15.131 --> 10:16.866
OK, OK, listen,
you want to talk?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.167
We can go out for drinks
tomorrow night.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.569
I know that you have been
keeping separate books.

10:20.569 --> 10:22.138
From the beginning...

10:22.138 --> 10:23.939
you have been bleeding
this company dry.

10:23.939 --> 10:25.174
Give me a break, Stan.

10:25.174 --> 10:26.642
I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

10:26.642 --> 10:27.877
Aw, the hell you don't.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.445
You know what
I can't understand...

10:29.445 --> 10:31.280
is why did you have
to steal from me, huh?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.182
What, Laurel didn't have
enough money for you?

10:33.182 --> 10:35.284
OK, you know what?
You leave her out of this.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.153
I never stole a dime
from the company.

10:37.153 --> 10:38.754
Now, Stan, you get the hell
out of my house!

10:38.754 --> 10:40.523
I'm not going anywhere,
you lying thief.

10:40.523 --> 10:41.717
You ruined me.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.378
I would've seen it all...

11:02.378 --> 11:04.347
if those glasses
hadn't nearly fried my brains.

11:04.347 --> 11:05.715
I thought you were
getting rid of those things.

11:05.715 --> 11:08.150
Well, thank God I didn't.
Don't you see, Becca?

11:08.150 --> 11:10.152
Those glasses put me right there
at the night of the murder.

11:10.152 --> 11:11.620
Laurel, do you hear yourself?

11:11.620 --> 11:13.989
-You know what's really weird?
-You mean there's more?

11:13.989 --> 11:15.758
The fight was taking place
in the living room.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.059
So?

11:17.059 --> 11:19.328
So the police found Nick's body
in the upstairs bathroom.

11:19.328 --> 11:22.832
Well, maybe
Coe dragged him up there.

11:22.832 --> 11:24.967
-Now, why would he do that?
-Beats me.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.202
It just doesn't make sense.

11:26.202 --> 11:28.170
Honey, nothing you've said
in the last five minutes...

11:28.170 --> 11:29.637
makes any sense.

11:36.846 --> 11:38.247
OK.

11:38.247 --> 11:40.649
Let's say these visions
were real.

11:40.649 --> 11:42.852
Why torture yourself?

11:42.852 --> 11:46.822
It's not like
you can change anything.

11:46.822 --> 11:48.157
I just can't put this
behind me...

11:48.157 --> 11:50.259
until I know what happened.

11:50.259 --> 11:53.362
But that's just it.
You already do know.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.795
We all do.

11:56.732 --> 11:58.200
Listen, I have a great idea.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.035
Megan loaned me her cabin
for the weekend.

12:00.035 --> 12:01.270
Why don't you come with me?

12:01.270 --> 12:02.538
Hell, getting away
from this house...

12:02.538 --> 12:04.006
is bound
to clear your head.

12:04.006 --> 12:06.031
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at noon. Deal?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.504
Huh?

12:11.614 --> 12:12.808
Come on.

12:20.389 --> 12:22.050
See you later.

12:26.228 --> 12:27.563
You have one new message.

12:27.563 --> 12:31.000
Laurel, this is Dana
from the D.A.'s office.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.736
We're sorry, but it looks like
the Court of Appeals...

12:33.736 --> 12:35.304
will rule
Coe deserves a new trial.

12:35.304 --> 12:38.007
Lew Gallo
is dealing with this now...

12:38.007 --> 12:39.975
and while we'd hate
to put you through it...

12:39.975 --> 12:42.711
we want you to prepare yourself
to testify again.

12:42.711 --> 12:44.770
OK? Thanks. Bye.

12:46.148 --> 12:49.174
Good. This time,
I'll have more to say.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.117
No! No! Don't! No! No!

13:22.117 --> 13:23.311
Come on!

13:28.524 --> 13:29.718
You know what?

13:33.462 --> 13:34.656
You're not worth it.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.010
He didn't do it.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.758
I'm telling you, Lew.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.460
Everything
Coe said in court was true.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.694
He had the trophy
in his hands...

14:05.694 --> 14:07.229
but he didn't use it...

14:07.229 --> 14:10.065
which means someone else
must have picked it up later.

14:10.065 --> 14:12.368
Let me get this straight.
For two years...

14:12.368 --> 14:13.869
you've been yelling
for Coe's head on a stick.

14:13.869 --> 14:15.170
Now you're telling me
the guy's innocent?

14:15.170 --> 14:18.274
I saw Coe leave the house
while Nick was still alive.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.109
-You saw a hallucination.
-No.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.745
Laurel, I know what
you're going through.

14:22.745 --> 14:24.580
You just don't want to let go.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.583
What I want is to find
my husband's killer.

14:27.583 --> 14:31.020
Now, I want you to release Coe
and reopen the case.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.855
I'm sorry, Laurel...

14:32.855 --> 14:35.119
but visions
aren't admissible in court.

15:48.397 --> 15:51.889
Ow. Stan? Is that you?

15:54.970 --> 15:57.871
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

16:02.011 --> 16:04.179
Oh, it's you.

16:04.179 --> 16:07.449
For a minute there,
I thought it was--

16:07.449 --> 16:09.852
You know what?
Never mind what I thought.

16:09.852 --> 16:11.854
I'm glad you're here.

16:11.854 --> 16:13.344
I really need you
tonight, Becca.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.751
Laurel?

16:18.494 --> 16:19.688
Laurel?

16:22.631 --> 16:24.360
Laurel, are you upstairs?

16:28.637 --> 16:30.764
I hope you're packed.
I want to avoid traffic.

16:33.709 --> 16:34.943
What are you doing here?

16:34.943 --> 16:36.912
I came to pick you up.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.148
Pick me up...

16:39.148 --> 16:41.083
To go to Megan's cabin.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.607
Oh, don't tell me you forgot.

16:47.956 --> 16:49.150
Laurel?

16:50.492 --> 16:52.428
Are you OK?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.830
Uh...I'm fine.

16:54.830 --> 16:57.800
I...I just got
this splitting headache.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.234
You've been wearing those
glasses again, haven't you?

17:02.337 --> 17:04.272
I think you should
give them to me, Laurel.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.708
You should have
gotten rid of them...

17:05.708 --> 17:07.175
when I asked you to before.

17:07.175 --> 17:09.371
-Just leave me alone.
-Laurel.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.787
-You broke them on purpose.
-What are you talking about?

17:18.787 --> 17:19.988
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

17:19.988 --> 17:21.922
-Find out what?
-Don't play games with me!

17:23.659 --> 17:25.455
Were you sleeping with Nick?

17:28.564 --> 17:29.758
Oh, God.

17:34.236 --> 17:35.871
You were screwing my husband.

17:35.871 --> 17:39.141
I never meant for it to happen.
It was an accident.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.976
You're my best friend.
I trusted you.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.511
If I could change it, I would.

17:42.511 --> 17:43.846
But you can't!

17:43.846 --> 17:45.280
You know,
ever since we were kids...

17:45.280 --> 17:47.583
you've always wanted
everything I've owned.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.451
You know what, Laurel?
That's your problem.

17:49.451 --> 17:51.253
You think you own everybody,
and you don't.

17:51.253 --> 17:52.454
What the hell do you know?

17:52.454 --> 17:54.456
You know, that's why
Nick stole from that company.

17:54.456 --> 17:55.724
He never wanted your money.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.292
He just wanted enough
so he could leave you.

17:57.292 --> 17:58.660
Oh, yeah?
You want to know what I think?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.862
I think he was all set
to blow you off.

17:59.862 --> 18:01.930
Only you could never handle
getting dumped--

18:01.930 --> 18:04.867
Oh, my God. It was you.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.468
-You did it.
-Did what?

18:06.468 --> 18:08.137
You killed Nick.

18:08.137 --> 18:09.805
Are you crazy?

18:09.805 --> 18:12.241
No, I heard him call your name.

18:12.241 --> 18:13.509
You were standing
outside the bathroom.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.710
-How could you--
-I saw it!

18:14.710 --> 18:16.044
Laurel, I wanted to end it.

18:16.044 --> 18:18.514
He was dead
when I got here, I swear.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.848
Then why didn't you tell that
to the police?

18:19.848 --> 18:21.583
Because I didn't want them
to think I was involved.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.051
Oh, so you just blocked it
from your mind...

18:23.051 --> 18:24.653
convinced yourself
it never happened.

18:24.653 --> 18:26.455
People don't just block things
from their mind...

18:26.455 --> 18:27.656
unless they're afraid
of the truth.

18:27.656 --> 18:29.158
Laurel! Laurel!

18:29.158 --> 18:31.593
Laurel, open the door.

18:31.593 --> 18:34.096
Open the door, Laurel.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.998
Laurel, talk to me.

18:35.998 --> 18:37.199
Laurel!

18:37.199 --> 18:40.169
Laurel, open the door!

18:40.169 --> 18:44.907
Laurel, open the door.
Please talk to me.

18:44.907 --> 18:47.109
Look, Becca,
I want us to be together...

18:47.109 --> 18:48.310
and whatever you decide...

18:48.310 --> 18:50.642
I just want you to know
I am still leaving Laurel.

18:52.447 --> 18:53.682
I'm just--I'm tired.

18:53.682 --> 18:56.084
I'm tired of checking her
in and out of rehab.

18:56.084 --> 18:58.848
If she wasn't so delusional,
she'd realize that it was over.

19:06.528 --> 19:07.722
Laurel!

19:20.642 --> 19:22.109
It can't be!

19:32.287 --> 19:35.779
I loved him. I couldn't have.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.165
Laurel, open the door.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.900
Laurel, come on.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.436
No.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.638
No.

19:49.638 --> 19:53.233
No!

20:00.916 --> 20:02.217
Laurel.

20:02.217 --> 20:04.014
-Laurel, open the door!
-Step aside, ma'am.

20:14.029 --> 20:17.132
I know who the killer is.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.700
It's me.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.670
I killed him.

20:21.670 --> 20:23.972
It's me.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.075
I killed him.

20:27.075 --> 20:29.912
It's me.

20:29.912 --> 20:33.081
It's me.

20:33.081 --> 20:34.449
It's me.

20:34.449 --> 20:38.287
Laurel Janus's vision of justice
has finally come into focus.

20:38.287 --> 20:41.390
The verdict--guilty.

20:41.390 --> 20:44.626
Guilty of a life
lived in complete denial.

20:44.626 --> 20:47.462
And now,
serving out her sentence...

20:47.462 --> 20:51.455
in a lonely corner
of The Twilight Zone.
