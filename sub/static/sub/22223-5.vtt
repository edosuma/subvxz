WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:03.117
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.212 --> 00:08.297
Noranti:
Aeryn is with child.

00:08.384 --> 00:10.420
Aeryn, why didn't you tell me?

00:12.305 --> 00:14.216
She say anything to you
before she left?

00:15.141 --> 00:17.598
He'll never bother you again.

00:18.603 --> 00:20.468
Is he dead?
-Yes, I think so.

00:20.563 --> 00:24.272
Say skernac. It'll save you.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.643
Bury him.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.394
They have body armor?
-They're shielded.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.445
That's a hell of an invention.
How come we don't have that?

00:32.533 --> 00:36.196
Computer:
Ka D'Argo, a received
transmission awaits your review.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.948
We have an answering machine.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.497
Pilot:
Ka D'Argo, Moya and l have
received your signal.

00:41.584 --> 00:44.121
Here is our location.
We look forward to your return.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.577
Pilot.

00:45.671 --> 00:51.382
By the yotz, Moya's all right.
She's waiting for us.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.345
And now on Farscape.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.142
How much frelling longer?

01:06.234 --> 01:08.600
If this is the right vector,
where is your Leviathan?

01:08.694 --> 01:11.151
Can you check the
environmentals?
The air stinks in here.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.605
l have topher root if
anyone's hungry.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.735
Absolutely not.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.317
Fun traveling with kids,
ain't it?

01:19.872 --> 01:21.203
There she is.

01:37.556 --> 01:41.014
Pilot, Moya looks beautiful.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.514
She thanks you, Ka D'Argo.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.720
We are eager to have
you back aboard.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.430
Rygel:
Not as eager as we are.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.686
Open up the bay.
We're coming in.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.313
Pilot, you and Moya okay?

01:51.404 --> 01:53.770
We are well.
-Pilot knows.
Knows what happened.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.150
So shut up and let him tell us.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.197
Tell what?

01:57.285 --> 01:59.150
Chiana:
Where the prang have you been?

01:59.245 --> 02:02.863
We stopped at Arnessk, then
searched for you at the
Burial Grounds.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.322
Crichton:
Back it up a sec.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.533
Moya was sucked down a wormhole
and spat out again.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.288
What happened in the middle?

02:08.379 --> 02:10.870
My memory is unclear.

02:10.965 --> 02:14.298
We were not harmed
merely examined.

02:14.385 --> 02:17.218
By who? Neeyala's
Pathfinder buddies?

02:17.305 --> 02:21.765
I couldn't say.
-You truly remember
nothing more?

02:21.851 --> 02:23.512
Nothing of importance.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.217
We await your arrival.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.393
Noranti:
How odd.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.186
He told me he remembered.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.480
Something's very wrong.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.898
I mean, what if?

02:30.985 --> 02:33.067
What if the people that
examined Moya are still aboard?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.485
Maybe it's a trap.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.982
One sure way to find out.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.564
Walk straight into it. Okay.
Weapons are primed.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.368
Right. I'll take point.
Everybody else stay put
till I give the word.

03:03.476 --> 03:04.886
Aeryn.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.725
You've come back.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.584
Everything's gonna
be all right.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.411
(sobbing)

03:34.882 --> 03:36.873
Everything...

03:38.427 --> 03:40.167
is gonna be...

03:40.262 --> 03:42.218
(gasps )

03:46.352 --> 03:48.343
Baby, you re burning up.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.765
I've...

03:50.856 --> 03:53.973
I've got Heat Delirium.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.526
You have to promise me
something.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.149
Promise you what?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.731
You have to promise that
you will not kill him.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.316
Won't kill who?

04:03.411 --> 04:06.118
He found me. He saved my life.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.287
Who saved your life? Who?

04:08.374 --> 04:10.205
Idid.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.041
No!

04:13.129 --> 04:16.121
You're dead! I saw you.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.831
You're buried. You're dead.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.091
What did you do to her?

04:21.178 --> 04:26.218
l have put her in this coolant
suit, to stabilize her fever.

04:26.308 --> 04:30.176
You're weak. You must resume
the full cooling treatment.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.351
You don't tell her what to do.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.349
D, get out here!

04:32.440 --> 04:34.146
No, he's right, and he's
not a threat.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.473
He's always a threat.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.183
No, lower your weapons.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.395
Scorpius, stand aside!

04:41.991 --> 04:44.277
Aeryn.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.778
What's he done to her?

04:45.870 --> 04:48.862
I gave my word that he
would not be harmed.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.287
Put your weapons down.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.205
And you expect us to
honor that promise?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.830
Yes, or I leave Moya now.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.172
What's he doing here?
What does he want?

04:57.256 --> 04:59.212
He wants asylum.

05:08.517 --> 05:12.430
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:12.521 --> 05:16.230
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.103
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:18.194 --> 05:21.186
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.271
my friends.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.152
I've made enemies.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.235
Powerful, dangerous.

05:29.330 --> 05:33.073
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:33.167 --> 05:35.909
to warn Earth.

05:36.003 --> 05:41.088
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.200
Asylum?

06:15.292 --> 06:18.534
What is it with Peacekeepers?

06:18.629 --> 06:21.462
First they hunt us,
then they wanna move in?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.335
Wh-what are we, a bed
and breakfast?

06:23.425 --> 06:26.212
We have a sign outside that
says "Free HBO"?

06:26.303 --> 06:27.588
Okay, space him.
-Yes.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.296
No.
-Let her rest.

06:30.391 --> 06:35.135
Allow her to return to the
chamber, then we will talk.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.393
Chiana...

06:41.860 --> 06:44.351
Aeryn needs help.

06:50.703 --> 06:55.572
You promise me that you
will not harm him.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.834
You promise me.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.294
I promise.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.407
What did you do to her?

07:35.497 --> 07:38.455
I saved her. Yes.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.160
She was alone, wounded,
adrift in a Prowler.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.291
In an advanced state
of Heat Delirium.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.122
Had I not found her...

07:47.217 --> 07:49.208
How did you find her?

07:49.303 --> 07:52.841
l was looking for all of you.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.547
Get it through your head,
Scorpius.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.180
You will never get the
wormhole tech from me.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.555
I could not use it even if I...

07:59.647 --> 08:02.559
( hisses )

08:02.650 --> 08:07.735
l merely want to safeguard it
and hope,

08:07.821 --> 08:11.484
that when the inevitable
Scarran bloodbath begins,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.361
you make the appropriate
choices.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.159
Oh, so you're here to be
John's protector.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.782
How nice.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.488
I don't believe it.

08:22.378 --> 08:24.118
Kryptonite. ..

08:24.213 --> 08:26.750
silver bullet...

08:26.840 --> 08:29.172
Buffy?

08:29.259 --> 08:33.093
What's it gonna take to
keep you in the grave?

08:33.180 --> 08:38.015
Perhaps we should just
take your head off.
Worked for Durka.

08:38.102 --> 08:41.594
Good advice, John. So why
hesitate? You know what
has to be done.

08:41.689 --> 08:47.229
Dammit, Harvey, guns are
dangerous, man and hey, no
smokin' in my head!

08:47.319 --> 08:49.560
It'd be foolish to
let him live.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.191
I need to know what
his plan is.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.317
Same as always. Surviv...

08:53.409 --> 08:55.616
To steal what is in here.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.240
So why give him a chance?

08:58.330 --> 09:02.198
What would you have me do?
Whack him straight away?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.163
Without hesitation.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.292
Ah, Scorpius.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.171
Your room's prepared and we've
relocated your possessions.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.878
How many coolant rods
do you need?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.258
( chuckles )

09:17.349 --> 09:20.056
Rygel, cut it out.
Aeryn needs those.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.977
D'Argo:
Perhaps we should save
them all for Aeryn.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.270
( hisses )

09:29.611 --> 09:34.275
Would have arranged for a fruit
basket, but we didn't know
you were coming.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.197
You play nice with the other
kids, all right?

09:39.288 --> 09:41.119
You know what to do.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.413
D'Argo:
Watch him at all times.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.292
Pilot of Moya, these consoles
need repairs.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.627
Where are the DRDs?

09:56.722 --> 09:58.178
Busy elsewhere.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.302
Have we been introduced?

10:01.977 --> 10:03.717
lam Sikozu Charnu.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.224
Command function is our
first priority.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.930
Send DRDs immediately.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.266
Ignore her, Pilot.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.818
Hey, well that s a new record.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.612
You've been on the ship
for less than an arn

10:15.699 --> 10:18.611
and you're trying to run it.
Nice.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.284
Chiana, someone has to.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.915
That someone is not you.

10:27.503 --> 10:31.872
You're cargo. Baggage.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.298
You think we forgot you were in
the grave with Scorpius?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.259
He's alive.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.883
You said that he was dead.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.807
I thought he was.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.180
They buried him.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.387
And then what happened?
What, ya dig him up?

10:48.482 --> 10:49.972
Hmm?

10:50.067 --> 10:51.557
Did ya tell him to come here?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.563
Hey, listen to me.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.191
Are you working with him?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.399
Crichton:
Never should have let Aeryn go.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.701
I should have knocked her
down and sat on her.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.951
John, it's not your fault.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.954
I don't know where Crichton is.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.205
( growls )

11:11.296 --> 11:13.958
( screams )

11:16.218 --> 11:17.754
Of course it's my fault.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.841
I'm really sorry.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.337
For what?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.139
For everything.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.593
This is not how I pictured
coming back.

12:09.688 --> 12:16.025
It's just fate, as usual,
keeping its bargain,

12:16.111 --> 12:19.194
and screwing us in
the fine print.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.909
So, how'd you catch this cold?

12:26.997 --> 12:29.409
Dancing barefoot in the rain?

12:34.296 --> 12:36.412
I can't talk to you about that.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.127
Why not?

12:40.218 --> 12:44.882
I really want to tell you.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.298
But I can't.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.310
And we need to leave
it at that.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.686
Okay.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.370
It's cold in here.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.380
What kind of room is this?

13:19.466 --> 13:24.711
Um... something to do with
regulating Moya's temperature.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.171
Now how d you find it?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.348
Scorpius did.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.016
'Course he did.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.186
(sighs)

13:34.272 --> 13:35.648
What else does he know that
I don't know?

13:35.732 --> 13:39.190
Does he know how you got the
flu? Did he give it to you?

13:39.277 --> 13:40.528
No.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.228
I had the symptoms before
he found me.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.359
You don't know that, Aeryn.
This is Scorpius we're
talking about.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.362
He could have engineered the
entire thing to get his
ticket onto Moya.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.239
He didn't.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.369
And I need you, I want you,
to believe that.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.999
You make it very difficult.

14:00.090 --> 14:03.127
Everyone, there's a ship
approaching fast!

14:03.218 --> 14:05.254
Well, Starburst now.
-We can't.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.926
Too much mass, too close.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.051
How can one ship be
too much mass...

14:10.142 --> 14:12.724
(roaring)

14:13.478 --> 14:15.139
Reverse! Get clear of it!

14:15.230 --> 14:17.642
I'm trying, but it's
moving with...

14:17.733 --> 14:20.190
( loud squeal )

14:20.277 --> 14:22.233
Pilot, can you hear me?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.447
Outside signal.
Overriding Comms.

14:24.531 --> 14:29.400
Ullom :
I am Ullom, Chief Protector
of the Prime Lukythian.

14:29.494 --> 14:36.115
Addressing the Leviathan
designated Moya and
all her crew,

14:36.209 --> 14:39.576
including the assassin
Aeryn Sun.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.834
I know she's suffering from
Heat Delirium

14:42.924 --> 14:47.213
because I induced it with a
bio-engineered contagion.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.636
It's genetically encrypted,

14:49.723 --> 14:54.342
making me the only one that can
save her from the Living Death.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.270
Is he for real?

15:02.152 --> 15:03.733
Aeryn?

15:08.617 --> 15:11.279
Ullom:
My proposal is simple.

15:11.369 --> 15:17.456
Aeryn Sun gets this antidote
when she gives me the names
of her employers

15:17.542 --> 15:21.080
and her fellow assassins.

15:21.171 --> 15:24.038
I await your reply.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.247
Aeryn, you have to talk to me.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.331
I can't. I gave my word.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.256
To who? Scorpius?

15:27.344 --> 15:28.834
He has nothing to do
with Ullom.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.465
You know the kind of games
he plays, Aeryn.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.887
He took advantage of a situation
he could not have created.

15:32.974 --> 15:36.432
All right, fine. Forget about
Scorpius. Let's talk about
Mr. Simple Proposal.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.136
He says you're an assassin.
I call him a lying
son of a bitch.

15:39.231 --> 15:42.064
What do you say?

15:42.150 --> 15:45.187
Aeryn, you have to give me
something. I don't care
what you did.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.190
I don't care about
your promises.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.567
Just tell me this.

15:50.659 --> 15:54.572
He says he has the only cure.
Do you believe him?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.122
So, tell me.

15:59.209 --> 16:02.121
What am I supposed to
say to the guy?

16:03.713 --> 16:07.922
If you love me,
you say nothing.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.458
Plan?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.919
Yeah. You're gonna
talk Ullom into

16:12.013 --> 16:14.220
letting us aboard
under a flag of truce.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.219
Then we take that flag of
truce and hit him over
the head with it.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.017
Mmm... feeble plan.

16:20.105 --> 16:25.441
Give me half an em with Aeryn
and a tokkar knife and I'll
get those names.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.733
( groans )

16:26.820 --> 16:29.687
All right, your way first.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.583
Ponara:
The missile carries
a pulse charge.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.956
On impact the pulse charge will
destroy the biologics killing
the Leviathan.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.628
Braca:
And it doesn't affect any of
the life forms on board?

16:47.716 --> 16:50.253
Ponara:
The passengers will
be unaffected.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.301
Good. Very Good.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.253
Then why don't we use it?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.258
Not yet.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.885
She wants a Prowler
to carry it.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.183
A projectile with this much
mass belongs on a Marauder.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.603
A Marauder would be detected
long before optimal
targeting distance.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.727
Sir, only a Prowler can
fly close enough for
a guidance lock.

17:06.818 --> 17:10.106
With that aboard, no Prowler
can fly steady enough to
get a lock, sir.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.405
Ponara:
My simulations indicate that a
skilled pilot could manage it.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.654
I'm the best damn
pilot there is.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.827
And I say you're dead wrong.

17:18.914 --> 17:22.452
Braca:
There's no need to take
rigid positions.

17:22.542 --> 17:27.377
Why not run another round of
simulations and recheck
stability.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.375
That should alleviate
your concerns.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.430
What sort of leadership
was that?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.887
Ma'am, this weapon is an
unproven prototype.
It needs study.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.564
I don't want studies, Captain.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.018
I want Crichton.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.549
Knock, knock, knock.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.847
Candygram.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.518
Ullom:
Scan showed no weapons on your
Pod nor your persons.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.185
Just as we agreed.

18:26.273 --> 18:30.232
Scans also show you aren't...

18:30.318 --> 18:32.354
Sebacean.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.982
You could have just asked.

18:35.073 --> 18:38.315
Do you want to see Aeryn Sun
suffer the Living Death?

18:38.410 --> 18:41.652
Well, if that's the case.

18:46.293 --> 18:52.129
So, you'll risk your lives
for this antidote.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.331
Cute. Hologram.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.087
And we wanted a face-to-face.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.169
I don't care what you want.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.971
I want the names of those
who hired Sun.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.468
We have no idea.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.267
You played no part in her
monstrous act?

19:06.354 --> 19:08.436
Don't even know what the
monstrous act was.

19:08.523 --> 19:13.392
She and two others invaded
our home world,

19:13.486 --> 19:16.774
and shot their way into the
governing chambers

19:16.865 --> 19:23.111
and assassinated our most
beloved Prime Lukythian.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.241
You know for a fact that
it was her?

19:26.333 --> 19:31.123
Before the killers escaped we
managed to dose them with
a contagion

19:31.212 --> 19:34.340
that induces Heat Delirium.

19:34.424 --> 19:38.918
Her illness should be all
the proof you need.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.845
Something's not right.
It should be blue.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.173
Scorpius:
Put it back and get
a replacement.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.600
Some fyang powder will
deepen her sleep.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.268
Crichton won't mind.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.847
Is he still aboard the
Lukythian ship?

19:51.941 --> 19:53.727
Yeah, with D'Argo.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.104
Been a long time.
Maybe they're making progress.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.686
Or maybe they've been killed.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.022
You didn't have to say that.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.118
( sniffs )

20:05.205 --> 20:08.789
Hmm. I hope this fyang's
still potent.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.411
(grunts)

20:16.091 --> 20:18.332
Yes, it is.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.180
You. Out.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.303
I'm analyzing...
-Now!

20:30.355 --> 20:32.846
Ullom:
But I must know who hired them.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.603
My people are ready to go
to war over this.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.399
Crichton:
You need to know who
paid for the hit?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.148
We don't have a problem
with that. We have a
problem with that?

20:39.239 --> 20:42.857
Ullom:
You might tell Sun that
if she'd cooperate,

20:42.951 --> 20:46.114
I'd have no reason to hunt down
the other assassins.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.944
Aeryn:
Ullom, I know what you're doing

20:48.039 --> 20:50.200
and you should know by now
that I will not play.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.326
Everyone, Aeryn's up
on The Command...

20:51.418 --> 20:52.828
Aeryn, get back to the
cold room now.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.204
Pilot, send the DRDs.
-You re dealing with me.

20:54.295 --> 20:57.332
Threatening my friends is
not going to help you.

20:57.424 --> 21:01.463
So, send them home,
and let Moya go.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.216
I am breaking this stalemate.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.764
Goodbye, John.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.816
Pilot! Somebody stop her!

21:25.201 --> 21:28.443
You said she'd cooperate.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.531
I said maybe.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.207
After a suicide attempt?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.752
I've been too patient.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.296
My soldiers could easily
board your ship.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.125
Go ahead! Bring 'em on.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.425
You know damn well
what'll happen.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.174
Aeryn will never allow you
to take her alive.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.847
And I need her more
than you do.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.347
So back off and we'll
get your names.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.191
(electronic chirping)

22:01.279 --> 22:03.235
May I talk to you?

22:03.323 --> 22:04.813
Please do.

22:06.701 --> 22:07.941
Flissok taka!

22:08.036 --> 22:09.401
(chirping ceases )

22:09.496 --> 22:13.205
Stasis command?
You speak Pilot?

22:13.291 --> 22:15.202
It should not even have worked.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.330
They're very badly programmed.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.208
Vakla norrok vez plokon?

22:22.342 --> 22:24.253
Krejna Skarn za?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.335
Za.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.512
Prejor Arnessk...

22:29.599 --> 22:33.558
vech plakato brixa skelt?

22:33.645 --> 22:37.763
Your death would serve me no
purpose, but your life might.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.234
So far it has not.

22:40.318 --> 22:44.027
I could not even prevent your
burial and yet here,

22:44.113 --> 22:46.525
they blame me for
your presence.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.820
How did you survive?

22:49.911 --> 22:52.243
Foresight and preparation.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.414
Why did you come here?

22:56.501 --> 23:02.337
To safeguard John Crichton,
amongst other things.

23:02.423 --> 23:06.632
You do realize that this is
a damaged Leviathan,

23:06.719 --> 23:11.053
with a fraudulent Pilot and a
crew of idiots, do you not?

23:11.140 --> 23:12.971
They need help.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.347
They are more resourceful
than you realize.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.188
Don't be so upset.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.440
Death is nothing to fear.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.363
I should know.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.364
( in Scorpius's calm cadence):
Why won't you allow her to die?

23:41.879 --> 23:46.999
Soon enough, you'll
wish you had.

23:47.093 --> 23:51.632
I'll get the antidote,
end of story.

23:52.807 --> 23:56.391
Oh, that's my Johnny.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.141
Still in denial.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.845
Do you remember what I
said to you once?

24:00.940 --> 24:05.149
Before the Living Death takes
hold, you have to be
prepared to kill me.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.022
Promise.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.228
Not a chance.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.110
Why won't you just let her go?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.065
She's not yours.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.198
Point of fact, I never was.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.871
Never will be.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.665
But you'll never be lonely.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.789
Whether I'm...

24:24.714 --> 24:26.420
here...

24:26.507 --> 24:28.543
or here...

24:28.635 --> 24:33.299
or in a grave on Arnessk or
a cell on Moya, you'll
never be rid of me.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.846
Aeryn:
You have no right to do this.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.389
It's my life.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.513
And what if other people
depend on you?

24:39.604 --> 24:43.267
Ullom doesn't care about anyone
else. He just wants me.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.485
Not as much as I do.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.652
I made a promise. Doesn't that
mean anything to you?

24:49.739 --> 24:53.448
Doesn't life mean
anything to you?

24:54.786 --> 24:56.447
When did you become
an assassin?

24:56.537 --> 24:59.370
When I found a cause
that required it.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.914
So tell me about it.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.162
Tell me the Prime Lukythian
is the devil incarnate.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.245
Tell me you did the
universe a favor.

25:07.340 --> 25:11.834
Tell me why the saints you're
protecting need anonymity.

25:11.928 --> 25:15.420
Tell me it's worth you dying.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.348
It is.

25:24.232 --> 25:28.271
Grayza:
Marauder recons have detected a
Leviathan which might be Moya.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.602
Any recommendations?

25:31.406 --> 25:32.020
Ponara?

25:32.115 --> 25:33.230
Sir.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.110
Is this missile operational?

25:35.201 --> 25:37.157
Absolutely, sir.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.327
Then I recommend we use it.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.655
Ready the Prowler.
I'll fly it myself.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.206
You, sir?
-You're convinced this
mission will fail.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.158
You're obviously the wrong
person for the job.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.165
Dismissed.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.413
Dismissed!

25:54.429 --> 25:57.045
Good hunting, Captain.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.305
Scorpius Clone:
No, John.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.678
John, you gotta stay away
from Scorpius!

26:01.769 --> 26:03.270
Just gonna to pick his brain.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.219
Yeah, that's what he wants.
A chance to lie to you.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.895
You gotta stay away!

26:09.652 --> 26:11.153
Harvey, cut it out.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.729
Don't you ever do that again.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.155
Scorpius:
That's it.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.372
Now, tell Crichton...

26:25.209 --> 26:27.200
Crichton:
So...

26:28.004 --> 26:30.495
that's how you survived.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.626
She was on your team all along.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.127
Untrue.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.424
She has just begun to help.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.718
How?

26:37.805 --> 26:40.296
By sticking another chip
in my head?

26:40.391 --> 26:42.302
Quite the reverse.

26:42.393 --> 26:47.183
This device will take the
neural clone from your mind.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.639
What clone?

26:49.734 --> 26:53.727
John, Officer Sun is in danger,

26:53.821 --> 26:56.107
and so is Moya.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.190
I can help.

26:58.284 --> 27:02.368
Simply clear your mind
and I will help.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.322
(grunting)
No.

27:05.416 --> 27:10.911
Consider this. I saved Officer
Sun's life while the clone
killed her.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.835
Scorpius Clone:
Don't listen to him, John!

27:16.969 --> 27:19.381
No John, that is not necessary.

27:19.472 --> 27:23.465
(slow jazz piano music plays)

27:23.559 --> 27:26.722
I'll get back into the dumpster.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.231
Come sit.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.433
What?

27:33.528 --> 27:37.692
This is a private place, Harv.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.068
You don't belong here.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.322
I've been your ally, John.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.278
And your friend.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.114
It's time for you to go.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.131
Take this.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.129
Please.

28:01.222 --> 28:07.092
Scorpius Clone:
How could I leave?
Your mind is full of so many wondrous memories.

28:07.186 --> 28:11.020
Cool jazz piano, chocolate
ice cream, women's perfume.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.642
Women.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.598
( guttural growl )

28:17.780 --> 28:20.317
How could you take
that from me?

28:20.408 --> 28:21.739
You're not real.

28:21.826 --> 28:23.782
I'm real to you.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.574
I'm real to myself.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.623
Sit.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.098
Goodbye then, John.

28:48.978 --> 28:51.094
I'll miss you.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.474
( screams )
(gasps )

28:53.566 --> 28:55.852
Jennok provadag!

28:55.943 --> 28:57.149
( screams )

29:00.364 --> 29:02.229
Without hesitation.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.074
(gunshot)

29:09.123 --> 29:12.661
(groaning)

29:12.752 --> 29:14.663
(sighs)

29:15.254 --> 29:18.041
(panting)

29:20.885 --> 29:22.750
He's gone.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.680
Harvey's gone.

29:29.310 --> 29:30.891
Now...

29:30.978 --> 29:32.809
help.

29:32.897 --> 29:35.764
( breathing heavily)

29:37.443 --> 29:39.183
What can you do for us?

29:45.076 --> 29:46.532
Information.

29:46.619 --> 29:49.326
In less than three arns,
the Prowler will fire a missile

29:49.413 --> 29:51.825
and Moya will be killed.

29:55.795 --> 29:59.504
If you don't trust me now, then
we're all as good as dead.

30:04.804 --> 30:09.218
And there's no way for us to
stop this Peacekeeper
super torpedo?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.641
Once it's locked on, it can
ride Moya's slipstream
through Starburst.

30:12.728 --> 30:16.186
Sikozu:
So we should Starburst
right now.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.273
Although I know we will not.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.944
No. Not while there's a chance
of getting a cure for Aeryn.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.313
There may be a chance.

30:25.408 --> 30:30.118
Sikozu has a theory about
the Lukythian ship.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.074
it's a chameleon.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.034
A projection.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.415
I buy that.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.248
Those guys are big on holograms.
So how big is the actual ship?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.926
Tiny. Crew of four or
five at most.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.924
That's better odds.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.347
John, I volunteer...
-No.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.140
No. And no.

30:53.227 --> 30:56.094
And no arguments.

30:56.188 --> 31:00.431
You have great difficulty
trusting people don't you?

31:03.696 --> 31:04.981
You're staying here.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.109
You're coming with me.
We may need a nerd.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.408
John, I've learned that we have
exactly one and 8/10 arns

31:11.495 --> 31:13.702
before the Prowler's in range.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.746
How did you learn that?

31:22.423 --> 31:25.961
I have a spy aboard the
Command Carrier.

31:26.052 --> 31:29.590
And she wonders why I have
trouble trusting people.

31:33.267 --> 31:37.180
Well, if it's any consolation,
I think you've had a
lot worse plans.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.262
Not by much.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.971
Pip, everything okay there?

31:41.067 --> 31:43.524
Scorpius hasn't moved one flot.

31:43.611 --> 31:44.817
Good.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.486
Pilot, get me Ullom
on the horn.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.188
Done.

31:49.283 --> 31:53.242
Ullom. Aeryn gave up.
She's ready to talk.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.660
About time.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.658
You should...
-U|Iom.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.583
Listen. She's ready to
talk because the
Heat Delirium's worse.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.285
We could lose her.
We're coming in now.

32:06.258 --> 32:11.127
Ponara:
Captain Braca, diagnostics
verify the missile's fully operational.

32:11.222 --> 32:14.089
Braca:
If it delivers on its
promise, Ponara,

32:14.183 --> 32:15.798
you've got a medal.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.515
Keep moving.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.892
She's losing consciousness.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.192
All right. Let's do it.
Come on.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.148
What are you waiting for?

32:29.240 --> 32:32.232
I can get you the names,
but you gotta save her.

32:32.326 --> 32:33.532
Now!

32:36.997 --> 32:38.658
Come on, do it!

32:49.635 --> 32:51.250
( hissing softly)

32:57.268 --> 32:58.678
That's not enough.
Hit her again.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.725
One dose is more than
sufficient.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.555
She should soon recover
enough to speak.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.021
He's still faking it!

33:12.116 --> 33:14.277
Ullom:
What's the point?
This place is sealed.

33:14.368 --> 33:15.778
You're trapped and outnumbered.

33:15.870 --> 33:18.327
Yeah? You got any more warm
bodies, trot 'em on out.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.372
Or get your own ass down here
if you got the nads for it.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.868
Any luck?

33:22.960 --> 33:25.121
It is completely sealed off.
There is no way out.

33:25.212 --> 33:28.329
Ullom:
That's right.
I control the ship.

33:28.424 --> 33:32.633
I can cut off your oxygen,
or let you starve.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.961
Come on, Ullom.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.307
Come out.

33:37.391 --> 33:44.138
Stop fighting your battles with
contagions and holograms
and face me.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.143
Or are you a coward, Ullom?

33:47.234 --> 33:50.442
I faced you once, murderer.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.986
You do not remember?

33:53.073 --> 33:56.110
You shot me and left me
for dead.

33:56.202 --> 34:00.320
You killed so many that day.

34:00.414 --> 34:01.745
I remember.

34:01.832 --> 34:04.209
But your leader had more people
slaughtered in one day

34:04.293 --> 34:07.000
than I could possibly kill
in a lifetime.

34:07.087 --> 34:12.548
And if asked to do what I did,
I would do it again and again.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.047
And I would do it for free.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.004
I wasn't hired to kill them.
I...

34:24.146 --> 34:26.637
Ullom:
My life support.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.268
What did you say this was?

34:28.359 --> 34:31.101
Crichton:
It's a Tarkan body shield.
It's the best part of the plan.

34:31.195 --> 34:32.310
Well, it worked.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.110
Yeah, it's a first, isn't it?

34:34.198 --> 34:39.158
I think this is a Control Orb,
a direct neural interface.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.530
God, I hate those.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.782
He runs the entire
ship with this.

34:42.873 --> 34:46.286
No. You run the entire
ship with that.

34:46.377 --> 34:47.662
No. No, I've never...

34:47.753 --> 34:49.414
Yes, you do.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.048
I will try.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.426
( moans softly )

35:02.393 --> 35:05.180
Oh, it's... it's amazing!

35:05.271 --> 35:08.183
I... I see every...

35:08.274 --> 35:09.889
every system.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.316
D'Argo:
You know what?
I'm really happy for you.

35:12.403 --> 35:13.893
Can you get us out?!

35:13.988 --> 35:17.196
I have to learn the ship.
Find the hatch controls.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.568
Pilot, how we doing for time?

35:18.659 --> 35:21.696
If Scorpius is correct,
you're already too late.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.154
You won't get back before
the missile is fired.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.534
Got it. Hatch open.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.490
I'll take Aeryn to the Pod.
-Right.

35:29.545 --> 35:31.501
You stay here.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.498
Wha...?

35:32.589 --> 35:34.329
Keep the motor running.
-Okay.

35:34.425 --> 35:36.416
Pilot, patch me through
to the prisoner.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.501
Scorpius, what does that
missile lock onto?

35:38.595 --> 35:41.211
A Leviathan bio-energy
signature.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.263
Yes.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.306
It's individual pulse,
if you will.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.259
Is there any way to shutdown
Moya's pulse?

35:47.354 --> 35:50.221
Only by a full biologic
shutdown.

35:50.316 --> 35:54.730
Yes.
-Moya could survive that for
no more than 800 microts.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.435
Crichton:
That might be long enough.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.111
All right, here's the deal.

35:58.198 --> 36:01.281
This is a chameleon ship.
You're a Leviathan expert.

36:01.368 --> 36:02.653
Create a decoy.

36:02.745 --> 36:06.237
A Leviathan's bio-energy
signature is very complicated.

36:06.332 --> 36:09.369
I will never get it...
-Just get as close as you can.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.623
All right.

36:13.714 --> 36:17.252
Ponara:
You should be coming into
range any microt now.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.675
Missile reads armed and ready.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.008
Sikozu:
I think it's working.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.675
Beautiful.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.507
( groans )

36:27.936 --> 36:29.472
You're still with us, Holly?

36:29.563 --> 36:32.305
Not for long.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.266
Life support destroyed.

36:35.361 --> 36:41.106
You have finished what
Aeryn Sun began.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.191
D'Argo:
John, get aboard.
We're out of time.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.240
Pilot's ready.

36:44.328 --> 36:46.239
All right, Sputnik.
Now or never.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.741
Right.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.118
Coming into targeting range.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.542
Scanning for Moya.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.290
Now.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.714
Come on, come on...

36:59.802 --> 37:01.008
Do it.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.303
Ah! They did it.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.177
Now, Pilot.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.258
I must have a system
malfunction.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.218
I'm reading two Leviathans.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.679
No. No, Captain. No malfunction.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.139
Marauder recon's reading
the same thing.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.441
Analyze the data.
Which one's Moya?

37:17.528 --> 37:20.361
Uh, we're checking.

37:23.826 --> 37:28.820
Vaklo enpya rossok wiklo, Moya.

37:40.384 --> 37:41.590
That's it. Lock it off.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.338
( gasps softly)

37:46.765 --> 37:49.097
Captain, one of the
Leviathans is dead.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.175
It has no energy readings
at all.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.726
It must be a decoy.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.223
You sure?

37:54.314 --> 37:57.977
Positive, sir. Transmitting
proper coordinates now.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.274
Received.

38:00.571 --> 38:02.357
Acquiring target.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.489
Here's your rematch, Crichton.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.291
Missile has been fired.

38:14.585 --> 38:18.954
It is now irrevocably locked to
the counterfeit signature.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.584
Pilot, resuscitate Moya now.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.836
Initiating resuscitation.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.713
You can do it, Pilot.

38:27.431 --> 38:30.138
Crichton:
Come on, baby.
Give us a heartbeat.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.849
It's not working.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.222
Moya have been dormant
too long.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.726
You can awaken her. You will!

38:39.651 --> 38:42.734
Come on. Come on.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.326
(systems whirring )

38:55.334 --> 38:57.290
I told you you could
do it, Pilot.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.503
You're the draddest.

38:58.587 --> 39:00.452
You're very kind to say so.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.253
Okay, we're in. Go.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.183
(moaning)

39:20.859 --> 39:22.474
Detonation.

39:25.239 --> 39:27.480
Wait. Readings have changed.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.483
The dead Leviathan's moving.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.160
The dead decoy just went
into Starburst!

39:41.255 --> 39:42.711
It... it's not possible.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.584
I... I had the correct target.
I'm sure of it.

39:44.675 --> 39:46.916
You're relieved of duty
immediately.

39:47.010 --> 39:51.470
Report to detention block three.
-|'|| handle the postmortem,
Captain.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.383
Report to the Aurora Chamber.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.145
Just take a seat.

40:00.232 --> 40:03.315
I'll be with you shortly.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.410
Crichton:
Congratulations.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.581
You made it through the day
without being shoved
out the airlock.

40:19.668 --> 40:24.287
Of course, this day is
not quite over.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.007
I have two questions.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.263
One.

40:32.347 --> 40:36.716
Did you do anything
at all to Aeryn?

40:39.771 --> 40:42.763
(sighs)

40:42.858 --> 40:48.444
No. I have not harmed her,
in any way.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.152
Two.

40:53.243 --> 40:58.328
On the Command Carrier, you
said you knew where Earth was.

40:59.333 --> 41:02.291
Is that true? Do you?

41:02.836 --> 41:04.622
I do.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.713
Anyone else?

41:11.011 --> 41:12.842
No.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.971
No one.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.143
I purged all records.

41:21.229 --> 41:25.848
The knowledge exists in here.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.105
You can use it to get home,

41:30.197 --> 41:36.909
or you can safely eradicate it,
by killing me.

41:37.913 --> 41:40.325
Again, the choice is yours.

41:44.211 --> 41:48.375
It is so, so good to see
you and Moya again.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.165
You know, it...

41:51.259 --> 41:53.796
it kind of feels like
coming home.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.926
We're equally happy to
see everyone.

41:58.016 --> 42:01.679
With the exception of the
newest arrival.

42:01.770 --> 42:05.228
I now miss Jool more than ever.

42:05.315 --> 42:07.601
Hey, listen.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.275
If Sikozu ever speaks to
you like that again,

42:10.362 --> 42:15.026
if she ever gives you any lip,
you just drop her in the
bat dren, okay?

42:15.117 --> 42:17.574
Nobody... nobody should
talk to you like that.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.697
Nobody should tell you
what to do.

42:19.788 --> 42:23.155
Yet, everybody does.

42:23.250 --> 42:28.210
In fact, Moya and I have
made a decision.

42:29.339 --> 42:31.000
You want us gone?

42:31.091 --> 42:33.127
Ah, not at all.

42:33.218 --> 42:37.211
But we cannot serve so many
masters at once.

42:37.305 --> 42:41.924
We ask you to choose one
spokesperson.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.474
You mean, just pick a captain?

42:43.562 --> 42:47.555
Yes. A single voice
for us to follow.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.273
I'll tell the others.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.773
We'll... we'll take a vote
or something, okay?

43:07.669 --> 43:09.284
:Eeiéé-f :

43:11.256 --> 43:13.167
Hey.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.419
What are you looking at?

43:19.055 --> 43:21.637
Nothing in particular.

43:24.811 --> 43:27.268
I'd like to stay.

43:29.524 --> 43:34.985
Well, I'm sure Moya would be
very happy with that.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.278
I need to recover.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.612
Is there any other reason?

43:40.702 --> 43:43.694
I need to help you keep
an eye on Scorpius.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.872
I'm not gonna hurt him.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.371
I gave you my word.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.577
I know.

43:59.679 --> 44:02.091
I want to be here.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.598
Is that a problem?

44:11.274 --> 44:13.356
Any other...

44:13.443 --> 44:17.106
oaths of silence I
should know about?

44:23.578 --> 44:27.742
So, you could tell me...
you were pregnant.
