00:10.678 --> 00:13.445
Blade to cube face four?
That's a showy move.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.047
You play
with too much bravado.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.049
Strategy
is an art, Rau.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.785
Maybe I'm lulling you
into a false sense
of security.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.654

nothing false about it.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.523

I win. I'll bet
your game

00:27.661 --> 00:29.395
has slipped
since you left Mandalore.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.196
Why do you
keep coming back here?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.232
You and your rebels
have imprisoned me.

00:33.234 --> 00:37.669
My Protectors have orders
to give you safe passage
through our space.

Reset the board, Chop.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.707
(CHATTERS)

00:41.709 --> 00:43.642
I want the same thing
we've always wanted.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.844
For you and your
Protectors to join us,

00:45.846 --> 00:47.913
to fight the Empire.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.983
I made a deal
with the Empire
to survive.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.852
I made a deal
with your Rebellion
to survive.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.387
But joining you?

00:55.389 --> 00:58.424
My only true loyalty
is to Mandalore.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.693
Well, I'll keep trying.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.763
I admire your persistence,
Sabine Wren.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.665
You could have
been a Protector,

01:06.667 --> 01:08.367
if not for your
traitorous past.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.768
Oh, not this again.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.603
We could still
work together now,

01:11.605 --> 01:13.605
if I were free.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.442
Not for the rebels,
not for the Empire.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.776
For Mandalore.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.111
ZEB: Sorry to
interrupt playtime,

01:19.113 --> 01:21.680
but Hera wants you
in the war room

Both of you.

01:28.722 --> 01:32.591
We've lost communications
with the Mandalorian base
on Concord Dawn.

01:32.593 --> 01:36.095
Rebel leaders are concerned
your Protectors are
setting a trap for us.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.630
Impossible. My men
are loyal to my word.

Your safe passage

If you've lost communication,
something's happened.

SABINE: I'll go
check it out.
I should go with you.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.707
They're my men.
I can talk to them.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.742
Wait. Isn't he
our prisoner?

01:50.744 --> 01:53.278
More like a cranky guest.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.647
He can go,
but he stays in binders.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.484
Take Ezra and Chopper.
Do a recon sweep
of their base,

01:58.486 --> 01:59.785
then come right back.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.154
You are not to land
or engage.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.791
And try not to wreck
the <i> Phantom II.</i>
We just got that thing.

Understood.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.845
(WHISTLING)

02:27.680 --> 02:30.749
Whoa. What happened?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.784
The Mandalorians
have endured wars

02:32.786 --> 02:35.120
since before the
formation of the Republic.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.524
Just as we'll
endure the Empire
and your Rebellion.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.759
Too bad
our people can't stop
fighting each other.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.761
I don't get the whole
Mandalorian thing.

Hey. Sabine?

03:11.125 --> 03:13.659

Where's Rau?

03:13.661 --> 03:15.694
I don't know,
but he's got
our weapons.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.564
Hey. Did we land?
(CHATTERS)

03:38.851 --> 03:40.219
Turn around.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.321
Slowly.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.660
Rau?

03:57.904 --> 04:01.673
Your men weren't
laying a trap.
They were ambushed.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.575
The Empire?
Not the Empire.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.144
Other Mandalorians.

04:11.784 --> 04:15.187
Precision detonations,
laser strikes from above.

04:15.189 --> 04:17.556
Definitely a surprise attack
by another clan.

04:17.558 --> 04:21.393
I don't get it.
Why would Mandalorians
attack Mandalorians?

04:21.395 --> 04:23.629
It's complicated.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.198
Look, Rau...
This is all your fault!

04:26.200 --> 04:27.933
If I'd been here
instead of locked away

04:27.935 --> 04:29.868
by you and your rebels,
I could have prevented this.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.804
We didn't mean
for this to happen.
You know that.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.439
They were my people, too.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.908
Don't talk to me
about your people.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.077
What do you know
of loyalty?

04:39.079 --> 04:41.146
I am not your enemy, Rau.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.981
None of this
makes any sense.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.950
Which of the clans
has the power to do this?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.885
Who would want to?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.420
(ON SPEAKER) <i> The Protector</i>

04:56.496 --> 04:58.664
Chopper's picking up
a signal from over there.

05:00.833 --> 05:04.069
SABINE: It's Imperial.
It's trying to transmit.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.976

05:11.911 --> 05:13.812
I can't hold it! (GRUNTS)

05:15.448 --> 05:16.982
Got it. I got it!

05:21.654 --> 05:23.288
Think it got
a signal out?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.857
Well, we're either fine,
or a few Star Destroyers
are on their way.

05:25.859 --> 05:29.027
You wanna wait and see?
Good point.
We're leaving.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.429
(CHATTERING)

05:32.832 --> 05:34.366
We have to go.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.035
I have no intention
of leaving,

05:37.037 --> 05:38.537
and certainly not
with you.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.806
The Empire could be
on their way right now.

05:40.808 --> 05:41.840
I've dealt
with them before,

05:41.842 --> 05:42.974
and I'll deal
with them again.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.976
But now, of course,

05:44.978 --> 05:48.880
I have the location
of your rebel base
as a bargaining chip.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.216
It's no less
than you deserve
after causing all this.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.919
I can't let you do that.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.326
(BEEPING)
CHOPPER: Uh-oh.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.961
Sabine, wait.
(COMLINK CHIMES)

06:02.963 --> 06:06.064
Last chance, Rau.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.367
The Empire? Already?

06:15.975 --> 06:20.412
What are those,
flying stormtroopers?
Worse. They're traitors.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.581
Mandalorians
who serve the Empire.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.085
SABINE: Ezra, run.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.932
Spread out.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.015
(CHATTERING)

07:00.286 --> 07:03.155
Stay alert.
They're around
here somewhere.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.828
Get him.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.700
Come on.
No.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.036
His sacrifice saved us.
Don't waste it.

07:23.142 --> 07:26.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! I give up!
Don't shoot!

07:28.414 --> 07:29.981
We have to help him.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.117
Think, Sabine.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.320
Your only advantage
is that they don't know
about you yet.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.890
You still have
his lightsaber.
That might just save his life.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.794
Come. I know a place
where we'll be safe
and where we can watch them.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.832
Search the area.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.233
I doubt he's alone.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.269
Who are you?

07:51.271 --> 07:55.974
I am Gar Saxon,
Imperial Viceroy
of Mandalore.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.244
And you, rebel,
are now my prisoner.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.857
How many are with you?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.959
I'm here by myself.

08:13.961 --> 08:18.663
(CHATTERING)
I mean, except for my droid,
and he doesn't really count.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.199
(SCOFFING)

08:21.201 --> 08:23.835
We checked the base.
No sign of anyone else.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.037
See?
You'll excuse me

08:26.039 --> 08:28.673
if I don't take the word
of a rebel spy.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.642
I'm not part
of any rebellion.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.944
I told you,
I'm a scavenger.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.780
Part of Hondo Ohnaka's crew.
He'll vouch for me.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.850
Oh, I don't think so.
The Empire is fully aware

08:38.852 --> 08:41.019
rebels have been
using the system
as a thruway

08:41.021 --> 08:42.821
to avoid patrols
in this sector.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.656
I don't care about that.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.492
I just came here
looking to salvage
some spare parts.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.195
You're dealing with
the Mandalorians now, child,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.532
not some Imperial officer
fresh out of the Academy.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.667
Look, uh, sir,

08:55.669 --> 08:58.236
I didn't even know Mandalore
was part of the Empire.

08:58.238 --> 09:02.207
Search his ship.
Maybe we'll find
the truth there.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.309
Until then,
perhaps target practice
with your droid

09:04.311 --> 09:06.177
will encourage you to talk.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.979
(CHATTERS)

09:10.816 --> 09:13.051
EZRA: Look, Viceroy, sir.
Shooting at my droid

09:13.053 --> 09:14.719
isn't gonna get you
any answer.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.362
We're going back.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.933
For Bridger? Pawns are
meant to be sacrificed.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.001
Okay. One, he's not a pawn.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.671
Two, Ezra can
take care of himself.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.273
But the <i> Phantom</i> has
our base coordinates on board.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.342
We cannot let the Empire
get their hands on that.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.879
You think I actually care
about him or your rebels?

09:40.881 --> 09:44.215
To think the Protectors
fell to these traitors.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.384
The leader...
He looked familiar.

09:46.386 --> 09:50.055
He should.
He's Clan Vizsla, like you.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.723
His name is Gar Saxon.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.593
He wanted to be our ruler,
but he had no honor.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.561
That's why the Empire
put him in charge.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.530
You think you're
any better than him?

09:58.532 --> 10:01.232
Everything that's
happened here is
because of you rebels.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.435
Okay, look.
You may not like it,

10:03.437 --> 10:05.103
but right now,
we need each other.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.206
Help me get my ship,
get Ezra, and then we'll all

10:08.208 --> 10:10.108
get out of here together.
Deal?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.309
You want to get
yourself killed

10:11.311 --> 10:14.245
trying to rescue
your friend? Be my guest.

10:14.247 --> 10:18.316
All I care about
is making Saxon
and his traitors pay.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.318
But now is not
the time for that.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.953
Well, I'm not
after revenge.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.421
Just my friends.

I'll tell you the truth.
I promise, okay?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.065
(SIGHS) My name is
Lando Calrissian.
I'm a smuggler.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.400
I heard there was
lost treasure here.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.069
I made a deal
with pirates, okay?
I swear.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.809
Every lie you tell
holds a shred of truth.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.411
You're giving me
what I want to know,

10:46.413 --> 10:47.078
whether you
realize it or not.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.328
Perhaps its

hold the secrets I want.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.529
Okay! Okay!

11:04.531 --> 11:05.964
(SIGHS)

11:05.966 --> 11:09.200
I was sent here
by the Protector,
Fenn Rau.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.102
You know
where he is, then?

11:11.104 --> 11:14.139
I don't.
But I sure wish I did.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.342
Is that so? You know,
I planned to strike this base

11:17.344 --> 11:20.278
and destroy these defiant
Protectors for some time.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.947
Missing Fenn Rau
was disappointing.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.449
<i>But his absence</i>
<i>did make</i>

11:24.451 --> 11:27.686
<i>the destruction</i>
<i>of his men easier.</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:30.388
I have been waiting
for Rau to return.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.490
I only allowed rebel
ships to move through

11:32.492 --> 11:34.359
Concord Dawn
to lure him back.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.128
But now, I have you.

11:37.130 --> 11:41.299
And I think you know
exactly where Rau is!

11:41.301 --> 11:44.636
And you
will take me to him.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.538
He was going to kill us
anyway.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.676
Rau, I'm sorry.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.012
Had you and your Jedi
not captured me,

11:54.014 --> 11:56.047
I'd be dead
alongside my men,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.649
executed by the Empire.

11:59.218 --> 12:03.354

secure our ship. Thank you.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.170
(GRUNTING)

12:58.778 --> 13:01.279
Where is he?
I don't know!

13:04.383 --> 13:05.450
(GRUNTS)

13:07.953 --> 13:09.287
(SHOUTS)

13:13.459 --> 13:15.360
Whoa. (CHATTERS)

13:26.639 --> 13:29.574
You just became
a much more valuable captive,

13:30.676 --> 13:31.910
Jedi.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.512
(RAPID BEEPING)
Get back!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.381
MANDALORIAN: I can't see!
SAXON: Where's my helmet?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.484
(COUGHING)
Get up! Come on!

13:41.120 --> 13:42.520
What took you so long?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.989
I was using strategy.
It takes longer.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.394
Rau should already be
in the ship.

13:51.263 --> 13:54.132
Oh, he's in the ship,
all right.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.034
How's strategy
working out for us now?

13:56.036 --> 13:59.337
Not so great.
(CHATTERING)

14:17.523 --> 14:20.558
Sabine Wren.
I don't know you.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.026
Well, I know you
and all about

14:22.028 --> 14:24.462
how you've joined
the Phoenix Squadron.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.865
I also know that
your mother is
looking for you.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.566
Don't believe him.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.302
Sabine never told you
about her family?

14:31.304 --> 14:34.739
Well. She lies
as well as you, boy.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.643
Her own mother stands
with me and the Empire now.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.312
I doubt you gave her
much choice, traitor.

14:43.582 --> 14:47.385
She came around herself
after you abandoned
the Imperial Academy.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.555
Your cowardice shamed
your family's name
and standing.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.590
Had you honored
your commitment,

14:52.592 --> 14:55.593
you could be
wearing this armor now.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.529
Sorry, Saxon. I like
a little more color.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.032
You think yourself
a loyalist?

15:01.034 --> 15:04.602
The Empire will make
Mandalore stronger
than ever before.

15:04.604 --> 15:08.506
The only one
who's gotten stronger
under the Empire is you.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.410
Out of respect
for your family,
I'll give you a choice.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.046
Give me Fenn Rau
and swear allegiance,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.815
or you and your friend die.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.354
I yield.
Sabine, don't.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.756
We have no choice.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.795
On my mark, send feedback
to frequency 337.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.475
Say it.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.247
I swear... That you're a fool!

15:49.249 --> 15:51.049
Chopper, now!
Whoa.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.018
(FEEDBACK ON COMLINK)
(ALL GROANING)

15:56.555 --> 15:57.989
Whoa.
Hang on!

15:58.624 --> 15:59.691
EZRA: Whoa!

16:03.796 --> 16:06.164
I want those
rebels alive!

16:22.014 --> 16:23.781
So what's your strategy
for this?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.616
They must have
a ship nearby.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.651
Chopper, find it.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.486
(CHATTERING)

16:30.255 --> 16:32.557
EZRA: Make it quick, Chop.
Her evil cousins are coming.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.094
They're flying
faster than us.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.844
Whoa!
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

16:52.846 --> 16:54.212
How about a little help?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.862
Whoa!
Too low, too low!

17:33.585 --> 17:34.652
(GRUNTS)

17:38.323 --> 17:39.590
Cut them off.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.607
Nice work back there.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.618
Sabine!

18:09.054 --> 18:11.622
(CHATTERING)
I know it was an accident!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.133
Tell me we're close.
Chopper?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.768
(CHATTERS)

18:23.770 --> 18:24.969
It's just up ahead.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.280
Whoa!

18:38.951 --> 18:40.685
(GROANING)

19:01.740 --> 19:03.341
(CHATTERS)

19:05.777 --> 19:10.248
Finish the boy.
Wren is mine.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.749
RAU (ON SPEAKERS):
<i>Gar Saxon!</i>

19:14.953 --> 19:18.089
<i>Those kids</i>
<i>are under my protection.</i>

19:18.091 --> 19:19.323
Rau.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.267
Go.
I'm right behind you.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.771
(GRUNTING)

19:33.773 --> 19:34.839
Sabine!

19:37.309 --> 19:39.610
You're not going anywhere,
traitor.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.546
I'll hand you over
to the Empire.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.181
(GRUNTING)

19:59.331 --> 20:00.631
(GRUNTS)

20:04.136 --> 20:05.636
Yahoo!

20:37.069 --> 20:38.402
(YELPS)

20:41.173 --> 20:42.940
They shot my jetpack!

20:52.351 --> 20:54.285
I really thought
you left us.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.188
I considered it.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.924
Then I realized
you were willing
to die for your people,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.759
even though
they are not Mandalorian.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.796
You haven't forgotten
our ways.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.032
That has earned my respect.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.101
Don't take this
the wrong way, you guys,

21:10.103 --> 21:12.870
but, uh,
Mandalorians are crazy.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.472
(CHUCKLES)

21:14.474 --> 21:16.440
Crazy enough to join you.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.775
Honestly?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.144
If you'll have me.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.680
I'd rather have you
with us than against us.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.216
Welcome to the family.
