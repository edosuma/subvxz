WEBVTT

03:16.261 --> 03:18.058
Train's late, Jesse.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.133
It'll be along. Get your clothes on.

03:21.233 --> 03:25.192
What about Grady and them?
They should have been here by now.

03:25.904 --> 03:28.464
Ask me, I say they ain't coming.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.837
Then who's that?

03:47.492 --> 03:50.290
- Hey there, old Jesse.
- Hi, Grady.

03:50.562 --> 03:51.697
Howdy, Grady.

03:51.797 --> 03:53.865
Who's that up there?
Ben, how the hell are you?

03:53.965 --> 03:54.933
Never better.

03:55.033 --> 03:57.302
Me neither,
soon as I get some of this dust off me.

03:57.402 --> 03:59.893
Come on, give me a hand here, Sam.

04:03.975 --> 04:05.909
Come on, get wet all over!

04:08.146 --> 04:11.377
Keep in there, girl.
Okay, Sam, grab hold of her.

04:15.253 --> 04:17.380
Hot damn, that feels good.

04:19.658 --> 04:21.625
Calhoun and Sam Turner.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.095
I've heard of them.

04:23.195 --> 04:26.331
They're good boys, and young.
A lot younger than you, but good.

04:26.431 --> 04:29.127
All right. What's it all about, Jess?

04:29.368 --> 04:32.337
Beats me. All Lane said was
meet him here at the train stop.

04:32.437 --> 04:34.740
- It would be worth it.
- To him or us?

04:34.840 --> 04:37.643
What difference does it make?
It's something to do, isn't it?

04:37.743 --> 04:40.612
Jesse, I get so bored
sitting around doing nothing lately.

04:40.712 --> 04:43.237
- Get to you, too?
- All the time.

04:43.882 --> 04:47.181
Sam? Take them over to the corral.
Turn them loose.

04:51.823 --> 04:54.293
That train Lane's coming in on,
when is it due, Jesse?

04:54.393 --> 04:55.460
Yesterday.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.762
Any women in this town?

04:56.862 --> 04:59.353
- One.
- Good, we can fight over her.

05:06.972 --> 05:10.271
It's a long time
since I've seen that big old Lane.

05:10.575 --> 05:12.277
He as bullheaded as ever?

05:12.377 --> 05:14.038
He ain't changed.

06:14.773 --> 06:17.469
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. Lowe.

06:20.312 --> 06:22.780
- We're working for her.
- We are?

06:23.014 --> 06:24.538
That's right.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.883
Doing what?

06:29.488 --> 06:32.557
Ben, would you help Mrs. Lowe
get set up at the hotel?

06:32.657 --> 06:33.954
Yes, sir.

06:43.435 --> 06:46.370
Now, what was that again?

06:47.539 --> 06:49.404
I said, "Doing what?"

06:50.642 --> 06:53.008
I thought that's what you said.

06:54.312 --> 06:56.081
What in the hell did you do that for?

06:56.181 --> 06:59.418
I told you to get me two guns
that would take orders.

06:59.518 --> 07:01.052
Draw your horses and skedaddle.

07:01.152 --> 07:03.588
- Ain't we got a right to know?
- No.

07:03.688 --> 07:06.591
Jesse, how about the pack mules
and supplies?

07:06.691 --> 07:09.421
- Ready to go.
- Good. Dynamite?

07:09.694 --> 07:12.686
- Ben brought two cases.
- That ought to do it.

07:12.898 --> 07:16.299
- What are you fixing to do, start a war?
- Look, Lane.

07:17.502 --> 07:18.804
You still here?

07:18.904 --> 07:22.101
- Damn it, we rode two days.
- That's your problem.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.812
You gonna tell us or not?

07:26.912 --> 07:29.514
Grady, where did you find
these two peckerwoods?

07:29.614 --> 07:32.150
They're standing up to you.
That should prove something.

07:32.250 --> 07:36.087
I don't need them standing up to me.
I need them standing alongside of me.

07:36.187 --> 07:38.390
All we want to know
is what we rode here for.

07:38.490 --> 07:41.391
What a gun rides anywhere for: money.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.262
The more there is of it,
the more chances you take.

07:44.362 --> 07:45.664
What about the woman?

07:45.764 --> 07:46.865
What about her?

07:46.965 --> 07:48.900
- She part of it?
- She's all of it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.802
What's that supposed to mean?

07:50.902 --> 07:53.338
- None of your damn business.
- Lane!

07:53.438 --> 07:55.640
We've got a right to know
what we're getting into.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.543
A grave, more than likely,
if you come along with us.

07:58.643 --> 07:59.845
Then why should we?

07:59.945 --> 08:01.746
Beats the hell out of me.

08:01.846 --> 08:04.516
Unless you think
gold is worth taking a chance for.

08:04.616 --> 08:07.278
- Gold?
- $500,000 worth.

08:07.919 --> 08:09.386
Already dug?

08:09.721 --> 08:11.154
Already dug.

08:13.725 --> 08:15.386
The hell you say.

08:45.724 --> 08:48.716
- Don't you think it's about time?
- All right.

08:49.628 --> 08:51.994
A train robbery, five years ago.

08:52.297 --> 08:55.698
Ten men rode away with $500,000 in gold.

08:56.301 --> 09:00.567
The fellow that was running the show
figured they ought to hide it...

09:01.306 --> 09:02.841
until things cooled off.

09:02.941 --> 09:05.043
So he took the Fargo box
and two of the men...

09:05.143 --> 09:07.304
and rode south into Mexico.

09:07.512 --> 09:11.312
Came back alone.
Said the other two got killed accidentally.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.278
His name was Lowe.

09:14.285 --> 09:16.276
The woman, she his wife?

09:16.421 --> 09:19.491
His widow.
He had the misfortune of getting shot.

09:19.591 --> 09:22.890
But he told her where the gold was
before he died.

09:23.028 --> 09:26.054
- And she told you?
- No, she doesn't trust me.

09:26.364 --> 09:29.234
All she'll say
is that it's four days south of here.

09:29.334 --> 09:33.395
If there was 10 of them jumped that train,
three of them dead...

09:34.039 --> 09:37.175
- that leaves seven of them still alive.
- And still kicking.

09:37.275 --> 09:39.044
You figure they know Lowe died?

09:39.144 --> 09:41.313
Six of them were pallbearers.

09:41.413 --> 09:42.647
Then why didn't she tell them?

09:42.747 --> 09:44.749
Get her husband's share
and let it go at that?

09:44.849 --> 09:46.618
That isn't what she's after.

09:46.718 --> 09:49.588
When she gets the gold,
she plans to turn it in.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.156
Clear her husband's name.

09:51.256 --> 09:52.991
Why the hell would she do that?

09:53.091 --> 09:56.294
They got a kid, a boy.
She doesn't want him growing up...

09:56.394 --> 09:59.431
thinking his old man
ran around robbing trains.

09:59.531 --> 10:01.099
Kind of high-minded, ain't it?

10:01.199 --> 10:03.068
Not the way she looks at it.

10:03.168 --> 10:06.171
Then why didn't she go to the railroad
and tell them where it is?

10:06.271 --> 10:10.275
That's what she was about to do
when I met her. I talked her out of it.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.538
There's a reward: $50,000.

10:14.179 --> 10:18.479
- Hell, that ain't no $500,000.
- No, and it ain't stolen, either.

10:20.118 --> 10:23.246
- We'll leave first thing in the morning.
- Lane.

10:24.422 --> 10:26.691
Talking that woman
out of going to the railroad...

10:26.791 --> 10:29.661
you might have talked her
into getting herself killed.

10:29.761 --> 10:32.229
You let me worry about the woman.

10:34.632 --> 10:36.031
Bullheaded.

10:36.768 --> 10:38.429
He ain't changed.

11:05.597 --> 11:06.894
Come in.

11:08.433 --> 11:09.798
Mrs. Lowe?

11:15.006 --> 11:16.303
Join me?

11:17.041 --> 11:18.838
Don't mind if I do.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.572
I've had a few.

11:24.182 --> 11:25.615
Yes, ma'am.

11:28.319 --> 11:31.982
I started thinking about
what I was letting myself in for.

11:32.624 --> 11:35.320
It's not too late to change your mind.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.263
Let you and the others go alone?

11:38.363 --> 11:39.796
Yes, ma'am.

11:40.064 --> 11:43.830
- I told you before, Mr. Lane, that I...
- You don't trust me.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.295
Can't say as I blame you.

11:47.539 --> 11:50.075
You realize if anything should happen
to me on the way...

11:50.175 --> 11:52.343
- It won't.
- But if it should.

11:52.443 --> 11:54.308
We'd be out of a job.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.549
This the stuff
you're planning to wear tomorrow?

11:57.649 --> 11:59.310
- Yes.
- Put it on.

12:00.185 --> 12:02.016
- Now?
- Now.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.411
- But...
- Put it on.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.182
You can turn around.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.623
The pants aren't bad.

12:43.228 --> 12:46.061
That shirt ought to be tighter.

12:46.664 --> 12:49.428
- Take it off and I'll boil it.
- Boil it?

12:49.801 --> 12:51.302
Shrink it up.

12:51.402 --> 12:53.705
I want you to stick out
in the right places...

12:53.805 --> 12:56.899
so that if anybody a long ways off
sees you...

12:57.275 --> 12:59.844
there'll be no doubt you're a woman.

12:59.944 --> 13:04.716
- Mr. Lane, if you're trying to shock me...
- I'm trying to keep you alive, Mrs. Lowe.

13:04.816 --> 13:08.686
If they see you along, they'll know you
haven't told us where the gold is hidden.

13:08.786 --> 13:11.055
And they'll be overcareful
to keep you alive.

13:11.155 --> 13:13.851
At least until we get our hands on it.

13:13.992 --> 13:15.994
- I see.
- No, you don't.

13:16.094 --> 13:17.829
If you did, you wouldn't come along.

13:17.929 --> 13:19.364
But there are only seven of them.

13:19.464 --> 13:22.901
That we know of.
With this much money up for grabs...

13:23.001 --> 13:26.937
likely they've got every two-bit gunman
in the territory along.

13:37.315 --> 13:39.783
Maybe I should go to the railroad.

13:42.487 --> 13:44.546
Maybe you should, at that.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.783
Thanks for the drink.
I'll tell the boys.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.259
Can't that wait until morning?

13:52.430 --> 13:53.954
Why should it?

13:54.232 --> 13:56.134
I might change my mind.

13:56.234 --> 13:57.428
Again?

13:57.969 --> 13:59.436
I'm a woman.

13:59.904 --> 14:03.032
And I'm out two train tickets
and five friends.

14:03.241 --> 14:05.232
Let's let it go at that.

14:06.544 --> 14:08.746
There's a train due
through here tomorrow.

14:08.846 --> 14:10.615
I'll put you on it.

14:10.715 --> 14:12.615
Good night, Mrs. Lowe.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.124
Mr. Lane.

14:29.267 --> 14:30.564
Boil it.

14:33.037 --> 14:36.234
Yeah. I'll boil it.

14:40.545 --> 14:43.480
- Stay with him, Jesse.
- Come on, Jesse.

14:46.284 --> 14:47.842
Grab him by the tail!

14:53.057 --> 14:54.592
I think them boys will need a hand.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.820
They'll need more than that
if that stuff blows.

15:08.539 --> 15:10.241
Show him who's boss, Jesse.

15:10.341 --> 15:12.832
- Come on, now.
- Hang on to him, Sam!

15:13.544 --> 15:14.909
Whoa, son of a buck.

15:18.049 --> 15:20.418
Don't you think
we ought to put this on a gentle one?

15:20.518 --> 15:22.452
This is the gentle one.

15:24.555 --> 15:26.113
Hold on to him!

15:29.727 --> 15:31.422
Goshdarned mule!

15:40.338 --> 15:43.466
- He's had it. He's all right.
- Okay, I got him.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.746
Do you mean to tell me
you're gonna trust that jackass?

15:48.846 --> 15:51.816
They get kind of rank
when they ain't had a pack on in a while.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.852
- He'll be all right.
- Ain't worried about him. It's us.

15:54.952 --> 15:56.647
He'll settle down.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.128
Here, hold this.

16:14.405 --> 16:16.641
How'd you like
to draw into a pair like that?

16:16.741 --> 16:19.938
Guess you don't
get to town very often, Calhoun.

16:22.213 --> 16:25.683
Go on, take a good look.
But from here on in...

16:25.783 --> 16:29.053
you'd better be looking over your shoulder
if you want to stay alive.

16:29.153 --> 16:32.123
All right, Jesse,
get her on a horse and point her south.

16:32.223 --> 16:33.520
Yes, sir.

16:35.526 --> 16:38.229
- Give him a hand with the mules.
- We ain't no mule packers.

16:38.329 --> 16:41.099
- You will be by the time you get back.
- If we get back.

16:41.199 --> 16:43.301
Do you see that knot-head
packing that dynamite?

16:43.401 --> 16:44.602
Do what you're told, Cal.

16:44.702 --> 16:46.204
- Yeah, but...
- Calhoun!

16:46.304 --> 16:49.603
There will be one boss.
Now go help with the mules.

16:52.977 --> 16:55.036
Just like old times, huh?

16:55.179 --> 16:56.840
Like hell it is.

17:04.821 --> 17:06.311
- Ready?
- Yes.

17:06.691 --> 17:08.488
Let's go to Mexico.

22:37.455 --> 22:39.753
You afraid of the dark, Jesse?

22:40.224 --> 22:42.351
- Fire's going out.
- Let it.

22:48.632 --> 22:51.965
- Something wrong, Lane?
- Thought I heard something.

22:57.675 --> 22:59.142
I guess not.

23:01.712 --> 23:03.414
Just my old heart pounding.

23:03.514 --> 23:07.109
Gets to doing that
when I'm around a good-looking woman.

23:08.085 --> 23:10.121
- Want some more coffee, Mrs. Lowe?
- Thank you.

23:10.221 --> 23:11.620
Coming up.

23:14.859 --> 23:17.419
Lane tells us you got a little boy.

23:17.828 --> 23:19.230
How old is he?

23:19.330 --> 23:20.731
- Six.
- That's a good age.

23:20.831 --> 23:22.366
What do you call him?

23:22.466 --> 23:25.094
Matt. It was his father's name.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.476
- Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up.
- It's all right.

23:32.576 --> 23:34.745
No, it's not all right. I talk too much.

23:34.845 --> 23:37.114
That's the trouble
with always running around wild.

23:37.214 --> 23:39.617
You get kind of starved
for female attention.

23:39.717 --> 23:42.653
You get near a woman, start talking,
and next thing you know...

23:42.753 --> 23:45.389
you say something wrong
and hurt somebody's feelings.

23:45.489 --> 23:49.357
Shut up, Grady, before you put
your other foot in your mouth.

23:50.094 --> 23:52.995
See what I mean?
Hurt old Jesse's feelings.

23:53.397 --> 23:55.833
Got him all mad at me for no cause.

23:55.933 --> 23:58.936
I've been mad at you
ever since I've known you.

23:59.036 --> 24:01.061
Jesse, that's 10 years.

24:01.238 --> 24:03.674
That's an awful long time
to go around hating a man.

24:03.774 --> 24:05.298
I never said I hated you.

24:05.409 --> 24:08.312
Well, there ain't exactly
any love between us.

24:08.412 --> 24:11.148
I damn sure ain't sweet,
if that's what you mean.

24:11.248 --> 24:12.316
You know, sometimes...

24:12.416 --> 24:17.046
I hate to break up this friendly chatter,
but it's your first guard, Grady.

24:20.057 --> 24:22.525
Jesse, you spell him at midnight.

24:23.727 --> 24:27.431
Don't pay any attention to Grady, ma'am.
He's his own worst enemy.

24:27.531 --> 24:29.123
The hell he is.

24:30.034 --> 24:31.435
It might mean nothing...

24:31.535 --> 24:34.698
but I think I'll take a pass
at our back track.

24:35.172 --> 24:39.577
Ma'am, when you finish that coffee,
you better bed down next to the coals.

24:39.677 --> 24:42.544
Gets kind of chilly
long towards morning.

24:54.592 --> 24:56.492
- Jesse?
- Yes, ma'am?

24:59.563 --> 25:01.861
How long have you known Lane?

25:02.633 --> 25:04.191
A lot of years.

25:04.902 --> 25:07.803
Me and Grady rode with him
during the war.

25:08.005 --> 25:10.997
Behind him, I should say.
He was our officer.

25:11.709 --> 25:16.339
We fought together for a couple of years
before he ever knew we had a name.

25:18.882 --> 25:22.318
Then one day at Vicksburg,
we were ordered up a hill.

25:22.553 --> 25:24.418
Over a hundred of us.

25:25.656 --> 25:28.352
Only three of us got to the top alive.

25:29.259 --> 25:31.124
Lane, Grady and me.

25:33.897 --> 25:36.957
We've been going up hills together
ever since.

25:39.336 --> 25:40.604
And the others?

25:40.704 --> 25:43.674
Young Ben, he's been along with us
ever since Lane shot him.

25:43.774 --> 25:44.842
Shot him?

25:44.942 --> 25:48.742
Backing out of a bank in Tucson.
Tried his hand at stealing.

25:50.481 --> 25:52.540
Lane broke him from that.

25:52.883 --> 25:56.649
Doctored him back to life,
got the bank to drop the charge.

25:57.087 --> 26:00.079
Calhoun and Sam, them I only just met.

26:01.291 --> 26:02.793
But from what I've heard...

26:02.893 --> 26:06.430
they haven't made up their minds
what side of the law they're on.

26:06.530 --> 26:09.055
That's the trouble with young guns.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.967
It's mighty tempting
to cross over to the wild side.

26:15.372 --> 26:19.775
I don't think they will, though.
Not now. Lane will see to that.

26:25.949 --> 26:28.018
How is it he never took a wife?

26:28.118 --> 26:29.380
He did.

26:31.455 --> 26:34.788
Right after the war.
Me and Grady stood up for him.

26:35.259 --> 26:37.659
I never got so drunk in my life.

26:40.764 --> 26:42.698
A year later, she died.

26:43.734 --> 26:46.294
We went up that hill with him, too.

26:55.546 --> 26:56.814
What the hell was that for?

26:56.914 --> 26:58.949
You were the last man on guard.

26:59.049 --> 27:01.415
- That's right.
- Count the mules.

27:02.086 --> 27:03.420
It must have pulled loose.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.623
And packed itself and walked away.

27:05.723 --> 27:08.692
- They led him off, then rode off with him.
- How many were there?

27:08.792 --> 27:10.327
Four of them I could make out.

27:10.427 --> 27:13.230
Let Sam and me go after them.
We can get that dynamite back.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.932
One stick at a time.

27:15.032 --> 27:16.667
Grady, when this is over...

27:16.767 --> 27:19.930
- What?
- You brought him. Saddle up.

27:22.106 --> 27:24.939
- I'm sorry, Grady.
- You're sorry?

29:57.895 --> 30:00.261
- Go pick him up, Cal.
- Yes, sir.

30:10.574 --> 30:13.805
How in the hell do you figure
that mule got here?

30:14.478 --> 30:16.346
Well, my Spanish is kind of rusty...

30:16.446 --> 30:19.049
but it seems those fellows
that borrowed our mule...

30:19.149 --> 30:22.641
wanted the dynamite
to blow their friends out of jail.

30:24.621 --> 30:28.113
Do you suppose
they'll let Cal have that knot-head back?

30:28.392 --> 30:29.984
I think gladly.

32:36.286 --> 32:38.655
Jesse, you better tell the boys
to hobble the horses.

32:38.755 --> 32:40.057
If we lose them in this storm...

32:40.157 --> 32:42.159
we'll have a hell of a time
getting them back.

32:42.259 --> 32:43.487
Right.

32:46.029 --> 32:48.395
- Let me give you a hand, Jesse.
- Thanks.

33:01.711 --> 33:05.078
I'm afraid I'm not sticking out
in the right places.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.252
I mean if somebody far off sees me.

33:09.352 --> 33:12.981
Yeah, well, I don't think
anybody will bother us tonight.

33:21.064 --> 33:23.430
I probably shouldn't say this...

33:25.735 --> 33:28.538
but sometimes I get to thinking
I'm making a mistake.

33:28.638 --> 33:30.207
I already told you that.

33:30.307 --> 33:32.002
I mean about the gold.

33:36.046 --> 33:38.276
What if I didn't turn it in?

33:41.184 --> 33:43.587
What if I didn't go to the railroad?

33:43.687 --> 33:45.621
You'd be a rich woman.

33:46.656 --> 33:48.592
And that boy of yours...

33:48.692 --> 33:51.728
would have a mother
that goes around robbing trains.

33:51.828 --> 33:53.693
You're an honest man.

33:55.165 --> 33:56.733
If you thought that...

33:56.833 --> 34:00.166
you'd be waiting for us
back at that train station.

34:01.037 --> 34:03.665
And what if you all didn't come back?

34:04.407 --> 34:06.209
Well, then you'd know...

34:06.309 --> 34:09.880
that we got to figuring
that maybe we'd made a mistake.

34:09.980 --> 34:14.076
Gold has a way of bringing out
the larceny in all of us, Mrs. Lowe.

34:15.217 --> 34:17.550
That's why I'm along, Mr. Lane.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.717
And that's why I'll stay along.

34:29.399 --> 34:30.627
Grady!

34:42.145 --> 34:45.514
- He's alive.
- He won't be if we don't get this off him.

34:45.614 --> 34:47.717
- I'll get his head.
- Stay away from him, Cal.

34:47.817 --> 34:50.719
If we pick this tree half off him,
he'll kick himself to death.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.723
- I know that, and you along with him.
- Yeah, but he's my horse.

34:53.822 --> 34:55.085
I know.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.759
- Grady.
- Calhoun!

34:58.261 --> 35:00.957
You've been warned. Make up your mind!

35:17.881 --> 35:20.816
All right, grab a hold. Heave!

35:27.457 --> 35:28.719
Heave!

35:58.722 --> 35:59.990
He's all right!

36:00.090 --> 36:02.692
That's good.
Now maybe we can get some shuteye.

36:02.792 --> 36:07.252
Soon as you hobble those horses.
Sam, walk him around.

36:07.464 --> 36:08.795
Yes, sir.

36:22.912 --> 36:25.847
I was wrong about you.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.549
How's that?

36:28.985 --> 36:33.115
For hitting you back there
when the jackass got stolen. I'm sorry.

36:34.557 --> 36:37.327
A man gets older,
it's harder to say that.

36:37.427 --> 36:39.657
He tries to bully his way through.

36:40.697 --> 36:42.232
I had it coming.

36:42.332 --> 36:44.434
- No, you didn't.
- I was on guard.

36:44.534 --> 36:47.304
So was I, trying
to catch you sleeping...

36:47.404 --> 36:50.707
so I could put you in your place
once and for good.

36:50.807 --> 36:53.510
While I was worrying about
kicking your butt...

36:53.610 --> 36:55.805
they stole that ornery mule.

36:57.881 --> 37:00.645
It was as much my fault as it was yours.

37:03.186 --> 37:05.552
I just wanted you to know that.

37:08.658 --> 37:10.558
What's wrong with him?

37:12.529 --> 37:14.326
Not one damn thing.

37:46.129 --> 37:48.359
- We can cross upriver.
- Good.

38:28.905 --> 38:30.507
I didn't say that she didn't say...

38:30.607 --> 38:33.043
that the gold was half a mile
from the river crossing.

38:33.143 --> 38:34.735
What I said...

38:37.714 --> 38:39.944
Slide off and let him swim!

38:40.450 --> 38:41.883
I'm trying to!

38:44.287 --> 38:47.557
What I said is, I don't know
whether this is the right river crossing.

38:47.657 --> 38:50.990
- This is the only one we could find.
- Then maybe...

38:54.864 --> 38:56.923
You think she's drowning?

38:59.335 --> 39:01.303
Sure does look like it.

39:16.219 --> 39:19.055
- Is she all right?
- Come on, give us a hand.

39:19.155 --> 39:21.391
Try to keep her feet higher
than her head.

39:21.491 --> 39:23.693
She'll be all right
after she catches her breath.

39:23.793 --> 39:25.495
- Get the whiskey.
- Whiskey?

39:25.595 --> 39:29.292
What are you trying to do?
Save her life or get her drunk?

39:44.781 --> 39:47.477
- I don't swim, you know.
- I do now.

39:49.552 --> 39:50.954
Mrs. Lowe...

39:51.054 --> 39:55.616
if that shirt shrinks up any more,
you're going to be in a little trouble.

39:56.059 --> 39:58.220
But not from you, Mr. Lane.

39:59.696 --> 40:02.290
- What's he up to?
- My last bottle.

40:06.402 --> 40:09.166
I should fall in the river more often.

40:10.907 --> 40:14.638
I haven't felt this good
since I can't remember when.

40:17.013 --> 40:19.504
Can you remember when, Mr. Lane?

40:19.816 --> 40:21.647
I can remember when.

40:23.219 --> 40:24.880
I'll have another.

40:27.991 --> 40:29.720
I drink, you know.

40:33.129 --> 40:34.926
But I can handle it.

40:37.433 --> 40:40.503
"Handle your whiskey
and never feel sorry for yourself."

40:40.603 --> 40:41.838
My father said that.

40:41.938 --> 40:43.339
Good words to live by.

40:43.439 --> 40:46.567
He said it to my brother,
but I never forgot it.

40:50.813 --> 40:53.782
- A lot of things I never forgot.
- Yes, ma'am.

40:56.953 --> 40:59.717
Do you always have to be so damn polite?

41:03.192 --> 41:05.092
Makes it harder on me.

41:05.862 --> 41:07.295
How's that?

41:11.234 --> 41:13.794
You're trying to trick me, Mr. Lane.

41:14.604 --> 41:18.040
Trying to get me
to tell you something...

41:19.475 --> 41:22.672
without letting me know...

41:23.646 --> 41:26.114
that I told you what I know.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.849
Yes, ma'am.

41:30.787 --> 41:32.880
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

41:33.990 --> 41:35.924
I'm the kind of woman...

41:37.260 --> 41:39.896
that, once I made up my mind...

41:39.996 --> 41:42.658
there ain't no turning back.

41:45.101 --> 41:47.126
And I made up my mind.

41:52.342 --> 41:53.570
You know...

41:56.913 --> 41:58.676
once I tell you...

42:01.084 --> 42:05.282
I'll probably never ever see you
or any of the others again.

42:11.127 --> 42:13.220
I'm gonna miss you, Mr. Lane.

42:17.634 --> 42:21.798
You'll probably be glad to get rid of me,
but I'm going to miss you...

42:23.806 --> 42:26.366
very much.

42:47.263 --> 42:49.322
We'll swing west to the Bravo...

42:49.465 --> 42:52.001
follow it on up.
That way we can stay out of trouble...

42:52.101 --> 42:53.568
Mr. Lane!

43:02.845 --> 43:07.183
That was a rotten thing for you to do
last night, getting me drunk!

43:07.283 --> 43:08.351
Yes, ma'am, it was.

43:08.451 --> 43:10.553
I suppose you found out
what you wanted to know.

43:10.653 --> 43:14.891
Yes. Cut those mules loose. There's plenty
of feed. Somebody will pick them up.

43:14.991 --> 43:16.326
Why don't we take them?

43:16.426 --> 43:19.562
No mules, no gold.
No use getting shot for nothing.

43:19.662 --> 43:21.731
- You're turning back!
- That's right.

43:21.831 --> 43:23.933
- But you can't!
- The hell I can't!

43:24.033 --> 43:26.102
When I start plying a woman
with whiskey...

43:26.202 --> 43:29.694
it's time to throw the key
in the water bucket and ride on.

43:30.039 --> 43:33.209
- Even if I tell you where the gold is?
- Even then.

43:33.309 --> 43:35.578
I'll go back to the train stop
and wait for you.

43:35.678 --> 43:37.612
Looks like it's a little late
for that now.

43:43.619 --> 43:45.955
Them pallbearers sure as hell grew.

43:46.055 --> 43:48.658
Maybe we ought to jump them.
Thin them out a little.

43:48.758 --> 43:50.460
We'd better get moving out of here!

43:50.560 --> 43:54.052
Cal! You and Sam hang back.

43:54.564 --> 43:58.022
Anybody starts crossing that river
before we're out of sight...

43:58.267 --> 44:00.098
- baptize them.
- Yes, sir.

44:34.170 --> 44:35.605
They're still up on that hill!

44:35.705 --> 44:38.174
Got off their horses
and went to cook coffee.

44:38.274 --> 44:41.175
If we're gonna head west,
now's the time to do it.

44:42.879 --> 44:44.972
- Unpack the mules.
- Hold it!

44:45.548 --> 44:48.278
- I hate to cross you, Lane.
- Then don't.

44:48.451 --> 44:51.147
I've got to. We just ran from a fight.

44:51.754 --> 44:55.815
That's a bad habit for a man to get into
that makes his way with a gun.

44:55.992 --> 45:00.452
- There are 20 of them back there.
- I'd say they were a little shorthanded.

45:00.730 --> 45:03.528
And so would you, if it wasn't
for the woman being along.

45:03.633 --> 45:04.622
Go on.

45:04.801 --> 45:06.614
I tried to warn you
and you wouldn't listen.

45:06.715 --> 45:08.671
You said to let you worry about her.

45:08.771 --> 45:11.007
Now you think
I'm worrying too much about her.

45:11.107 --> 45:14.804
- If we swing west, you are.
- He's right.

45:15.244 --> 45:17.714
Don't make no sense,
riding off without that gold.

45:17.814 --> 45:20.516
- It does to me.
- It won't to them back there.

45:20.616 --> 45:22.952
They're gonna come killing,
no matter what we do.

45:23.052 --> 45:25.621
You're wrong and you won't admit it!

45:25.721 --> 45:28.053
You're just bullying your way through.

45:30.560 --> 45:33.120
Seems like I heard
somebody say that before.

45:38.534 --> 45:41.059
- Mrs. Lowe?
- Yes?

45:41.804 --> 45:43.431
Where the hell is that gold?

47:40.890 --> 47:43.593
- It's a hell of a way to run a railroad.
- What?

47:43.693 --> 47:47.263
I said it's a hell of a way to
run a railroad, without any tracks!

47:47.363 --> 47:49.532
When this wind lays down,
we'll find them.

47:49.632 --> 47:53.936
If you ask me, I say we won't.
I say Lowe lied to the woman.

47:54.036 --> 47:55.638
Why the hell would he do that?

47:55.738 --> 47:58.074
Any man who's gonna steal gold
from one train...

47:58.174 --> 48:00.843
and put it on another train
is liable to do anything.

48:00.943 --> 48:02.912
It struck me as a pretty good idea.

48:03.012 --> 48:05.314
At least he knew
it would be there when be got back.

48:05.414 --> 48:07.917
- Maybe.
- You heard what the woman said.

48:08.017 --> 48:11.721
I'm not talking about the train.
I'm talking about the $500,000.

48:11.821 --> 48:15.358
You wouldn't catch me hiding that much
gold in the boiler of a six-wheeler!

48:15.458 --> 48:18.861
- What?
- The gold is in the firebox of the engine!

48:18.961 --> 48:22.665
What if somebody decided to build up
a head of steam and struck a match to it?

48:22.765 --> 48:25.700
It's been laying upside down
at the bottom of a grade...

48:25.968 --> 48:29.495
along with two flatcars, ever since
timber trains ran in this country...

48:29.739 --> 48:33.476
- and that's a hell of a long time ago.
- I'll believe that when I see it.

48:33.576 --> 48:36.010
Wonder whatever happened
to that old boy.

48:36.612 --> 48:37.747
What old boy?

48:37.847 --> 48:40.416
The one that came riding in back
at the train stop...

48:40.516 --> 48:44.577
laughing and scratching, saying how good
it was to have something to do.

48:47.356 --> 48:49.654
Grady, you're a pain in the neck.

48:50.593 --> 48:52.493
Hell, everybody knows that.

51:21.143 --> 51:22.940
- Get the woman.
- What?

51:41.864 --> 51:46.631
Walk out there, where they can
get a good look at you. Go on.

51:55.811 --> 51:59.014
It rubs me the wrong way,
hiding behind a woman, if you ask me.

51:59.114 --> 52:00.240
Nobody did.

52:12.595 --> 52:15.164
- What if they throw down on us?
- They won't.

52:15.264 --> 52:18.893
But you've thought it all out. Maybe
they haven't. Maybe they haven't even...

52:25.941 --> 52:29.104
- I thought you...
- So did I.

52:29.812 --> 52:31.302
Let's get out of here.

53:24.833 --> 53:28.938
I hope we're not depending on any luck
to get us back to that train stop.

53:29.038 --> 53:32.007
- I think we just ran out.
- Not quite.

54:49.985 --> 54:52.221
I thought somebody said
the gold was already dug.

54:52.321 --> 54:53.811
Keep digging.

55:03.799 --> 55:05.266
That'll get it.

56:15.137 --> 56:18.574
- That's what it's all about.
- I'd say it's time to load the mules.

56:18.674 --> 56:21.905
I wouldn't.
We're staying here for a while.

56:22.177 --> 56:23.946
- Staying?
- That's right.

56:24.046 --> 56:26.749
Them 20 get up on that rim
with rifles...

56:26.849 --> 56:28.650
it could get a little hard
to stay alive.

56:28.750 --> 56:31.754
Yeah, but not as hard
as getting caught out in the open.

56:31.854 --> 56:33.956
We've got to make a run for it
sooner or later.

56:34.056 --> 56:36.718
Later, there may not be
so many of them around.

56:37.526 --> 56:42.088
String a picket line over those flatcars.
The rest of you give him a hand.

56:43.632 --> 56:46.335
You unload that mule. Bury the dynamite.

56:46.435 --> 56:47.569
Bury it?

56:47.669 --> 56:51.161
You wouldn't want to get blown
to hell for a stray bullet, would you?

56:51.607 --> 56:52.767
No, sir.

56:58.680 --> 57:02.116
If they see that Fargo box,
they'll hit us, won't they?

57:02.784 --> 57:05.252
Just as hard as they can, Mrs. Lowe.

58:18.260 --> 58:21.696
If you ask me, I say they're not
gonna jump us, not here.

58:22.531 --> 58:25.591
Probably wait at the river
and catch us crossing.

58:27.869 --> 58:31.306
What I'm trying to figure out is why
we're going back the way we came.

58:31.406 --> 58:33.675
Apart from that village,
there's not a whole lot...

58:33.775 --> 58:36.403
to hide behind
between us and that rail stop.

58:36.712 --> 58:41.115
Lane says this is the closest way out.
Besides, we know the ground.

58:42.184 --> 58:44.584
Yeah, we could get buried in it, too.

58:44.820 --> 58:48.620
- Hell, a man can't live forever.
- Not around Lane, he can't.

58:54.162 --> 58:57.063
Come to think of it,
it's the best way, anyway.

58:57.232 --> 59:01.191
- What's that?
- You and me, we can't get old.

59:02.270 --> 59:05.933
What the hell use are we going to be
to anybody in a rocking chair?

59:06.241 --> 59:10.905
- That's a long ways down the road.
- The hell it is.

59:12.314 --> 59:16.011
You're not one damn day older than
you were the first time I ever met you.

59:16.218 --> 59:19.381
Not outside, I ain't,
but it's inside that counts.

59:22.124 --> 59:25.160
Time was I could get drunk
for a week, maybe two.

59:25.260 --> 59:27.195
Now I go on a bender
for six or seven days...

59:27.295 --> 59:30.822
and I get the blind staggers so bad,
I gotta get me to my bed.

59:33.268 --> 59:36.635
When a man can't hold his liquor,
that's the first sign.

59:37.673 --> 59:40.175
- What about your women?
- What about them?

59:40.275 --> 59:43.767
Don't tell me you don't run them
as much as you used to.

59:50.085 --> 59:52.952
Now, I wouldn't want this
to get around...

59:53.655 --> 59:57.147
but the last time I was over
to Kate's in Tucson...

59:57.726 --> 59:59.819
I spent the whole night...

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:03.164
listening to a fellow play the piano.

01:00:05.133 --> 01:00:07.966
- Could he play good?
- Worst I ever heard!

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.399
You just weren't in the mood.

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:13.666
I'm not getting any younger,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:14.876
Neither are you.

01:00:14.976 --> 01:00:17.679
What the hell do you want me to do,
just roll over and die?

01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:20.111
All I'm saying is, don't get old.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.647
You'll live to regret it.

01:00:42.537 --> 01:00:45.938
- Not yet.
- They'll be along.

01:00:53.515 --> 01:00:55.312
I hope I don't let you down.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:59.148
You planning to rob another bank?

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:03.519
No, sir, I mean when those 20 jump us.

01:01:04.426 --> 01:01:06.621
- You'll be all right.
- I don't know.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:13.524
I was thinking a few minutes ago that
I ought to get on my horse and get out.

01:01:13.702 --> 01:01:15.863
Get out and never look back.

01:01:16.505 --> 01:01:19.167
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:20.938
Why?

01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:24.946
I don't know. Maybe I was afraid
you'd come after me.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.876
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?

01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:31.520
I hate to have to tell you this,
but whether you like it or not...

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.214
you're a man and you're stuck with it.

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:39.218
You'll find yourself standing your ground,
and fighting when you ought to run...

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:43.427
speaking out when you ought to keep
your mouth shut...

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:48.135
doing things that will seem wrong
to a lot of people...

01:01:48.837 --> 01:01:50.839
but you'll do them all the same.

01:01:50.939 --> 01:01:53.100
You mean like talking up
for me in Tucson?

01:01:53.708 --> 01:01:57.542
- They were wrong.
- Not if I ain't all the things you think I am.

01:01:58.647 --> 01:02:01.083
- Not if I turn and run.
- You won't.

01:02:01.183 --> 01:02:04.653
You're going to spend the rest
of your life getting up one more time...

01:02:04.753 --> 01:02:08.314
than you're knocked down,
so you better start getting used to it.

01:02:29.144 --> 01:02:31.977
If any trouble starts, under there.

01:02:32.814 --> 01:02:34.679
Cooking coffee again.

01:02:39.154 --> 01:02:41.452
Like hell! Get under there.

01:04:30.865 --> 01:04:33.095
- Ten men.
- So far.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.566
- Maybe they'll give it up.
- They should.

01:04:39.341 --> 01:04:42.504
- They can't shoot worth a damn.
- But they won't.

01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:46.410
No, they won't.

01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:49.880
Then maybe we should.

01:04:50.185 --> 01:04:52.745
Your mind is as changeable
as the weather.

01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:54.817
It's not a joke, Mr. Lane.

01:04:55.357 --> 01:04:58.520
I tried to tell you that
before we left the train station.

01:04:58.827 --> 01:05:01.660
- You wouldn't listen to me.
- Now you won't.

01:05:02.464 --> 01:05:04.625
Not to turning it over
to the likes of them.

01:05:04.733 --> 01:05:06.001
But they're not going to...

01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:10.162
I set out to get you and that gold
back to the railroad.

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:12.631
That's what I fully intend to do.

01:05:12.807 --> 01:05:14.297
No matter what?

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.537
No matter what.

01:05:30.225 --> 01:05:33.929
Lane, they'll more than likely
try and run the horses off tonight.

01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:37.499
- You and Sam make sure they don't.
- We may need some help.

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:40.568
You won't get it.
The rest of us will be gone.

01:05:40.869 --> 01:05:43.531
- Gone?
- To run off their horses.

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:48.297
Ben, dig up the dynamite.

01:08:52.993 --> 01:08:54.551
They're running.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:57.298
Not as fast as their horses.

01:08:57.398 --> 01:09:01.630
Ben, you better take care of that leg.
I'll see if the woman's all right.

01:09:04.037 --> 01:09:07.872
- What the hell are you doing up there?
- They needed help.

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:09.665
Get down.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:19.185
Give me that.

01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:23.249
You going to knock me
on my butt, Mr. Lane?

01:09:24.024 --> 01:09:25.652
Maybe I should, at that.

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:33.996
Don't you think we better
get the hell out of here?

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.863
The sooner the better.

01:11:40.094 --> 01:11:42.764
- Ben, how's your leg?
- It's getting better.

01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:46.134
It'll be all right as long as I don't have
to wrangle that damn mule.

01:11:46.234 --> 01:11:47.769
You don't have to worry about that.

01:11:47.869 --> 01:11:50.736
As long as she's packing
that gold, we're in love!

01:11:52.006 --> 01:11:55.510
- How about you?
- Are there any more rivers to cross?

01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:58.212
- Just a little creek.
- I'll make it.

01:11:58.312 --> 01:12:01.440
If them pallbearers jump us here,
they'll wish they hadn't.

01:12:03.084 --> 01:12:05.486
You put old Jesse and me
up in that church tower...

01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:09.147
with a couple of Winchesters,
they'll never know what hit them.

01:12:09.824 --> 01:12:12.452
- We're not staying.
- How the hell come?

01:12:14.962 --> 01:12:16.987
Did you ever bury a baby?

01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:20.823
No.

01:12:21.035 --> 01:12:25.734
Neither have I, and I don't intend to.
Not over gold. Let's move.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:05.270
Better put some more wood on there.

01:14:07.575 --> 01:14:11.602
Not too much. We don't want
them to think we're asking for it.

01:14:17.418 --> 01:14:19.579
Can't say that I like this, Jesse.

01:14:20.454 --> 01:14:23.257
We've done this once before,
during the war.

01:14:23.357 --> 01:14:25.626
Me and Lane got up on the high ground...

01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:28.820
left Grady sitting by a fire,
just like this one.

01:14:29.163 --> 01:14:32.621
Blankets spread all around,
just like we were all sleeping.

01:14:34.468 --> 01:14:37.460
We were trying to scald
them Rebs into the open.

01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:40.741
They were driving off
a lot of our horses.

01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:43.742
- Did it work?
- It's according to how you look at it.

01:14:44.712 --> 01:14:48.045
Long about morning,
me and Lane kind of fell asleep.

01:14:48.683 --> 01:14:52.210
- When we woke up, Grady was gone.
- Gone?

01:14:53.421 --> 01:14:56.322
Yeah, the Rebs sneaked in
and took him prisoner.

01:14:56.424 --> 01:15:00.520
Never even fired a shot. If they had,
they wouldn't have got him.

01:15:02.096 --> 01:15:04.792
I tried to talk Lane
into letting them keep him.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.661
I think he would have, but he figured
it was our fault that he was took.

01:15:09.937 --> 01:15:13.805
They kept him a week and it was
the best seven days of the war.

01:15:15.242 --> 01:15:17.870
It's hard as hell to get to like Grady.

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:20.672
- Hell, he likes you.
- He's got to.

01:15:21.082 --> 01:15:24.176
Me and Lane are the only ones
who will put up with him.

01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:28.744
I've got to admit, though,
he's saved our hide a lot of times.

01:15:32.026 --> 01:15:36.019
Jesse, after this is all over with...

01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:40.823
do you suppose, maybe me and Sam
could stay along a while?

01:15:42.203 --> 01:15:45.873
I figured you two would just roar off
and spend your share of the reward.

01:15:45.973 --> 01:15:50.501
We can go together.
Find some women. Get drunk.

01:15:51.812 --> 01:15:54.303
That beats the hell out of cold coffee.

01:15:55.349 --> 01:15:58.512
- I figure we better get some shuteye.
- Shuteye?

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.455
Yeah, Lane will see
that we're not disturbed.

01:16:01.555 --> 01:16:05.184
- What if he falls asleep like he did before?
- He won't.

01:16:05.326 --> 01:16:08.818
Losing Grady is one thing.
Gold is something else.

01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.262
Good night.

01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:18.636
I hope so.

01:16:50.504 --> 01:16:52.028
We better give them a rest.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.601
Ben, you stay aboard.

01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:04.908
It don't seem right,
those boys haven't showed up.

01:17:06.954 --> 01:17:10.117
- Probably still on foot.
- I doubt that.

01:17:11.392 --> 01:17:15.021
If those horses stop running,
they'll start thinking of water...

01:17:15.129 --> 01:17:16.994
head for that river.

01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:19.665
So many of them,
they won't be hard to track.

01:17:19.934 --> 01:17:22.562
Yeah, they double back to the river...

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.174
pick up their saddles,
that'll throw them about a day behind.

01:17:27.274 --> 01:17:31.108
It shouldn't.
No mules to slow them down.

01:17:32.646 --> 01:17:34.248
Then where the hell are they?

01:17:34.348 --> 01:17:37.476
If I knew that, I could
get some sleep tonight.

01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:24.029
Thank you. Hot.

01:18:25.866 --> 01:18:29.927
We'll be at the train stop tomorrow.
And then what?

01:18:31.772 --> 01:18:34.434
There's a north-bound
due through at midnight.

01:18:34.909 --> 01:18:37.378
Any luck, then we can get you
and the gold on it...

01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:39.742
before anybody else jumps us.

01:18:40.481 --> 01:18:44.076
- You're not coming?
- I'll stay along with the boys.

01:18:45.085 --> 01:18:47.986
After this, I'll probably
have to buy them a drink or two.

01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.684
What about the reward?

01:18:51.559 --> 01:18:55.825
You can tell the railroad
we'll drift by and pick it up.

01:18:57.932 --> 01:19:01.060
That's all you do, isn't it? Drift.

01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:03.570
You could say that.

01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:07.232
- Doesn't seem like much of a life.
- It's not.

01:19:07.408 --> 01:19:11.037
- Then why do you do it?
- It's what I'm good at.

01:19:11.879 --> 01:19:16.043
- My husband was good at robbing trains.
- Your husband was a fool.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:20.718
Because he got shot in the back
in a whorehouse?

01:19:22.957 --> 01:19:26.085
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:28.927
For him or me?

01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:31.664
The boy.

01:19:38.973 --> 01:19:41.271
No matter how things turn out...

01:19:42.509 --> 01:19:45.342
I want to thank you
for all that you've done and...

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.216
if you should change your mind
about coming back with me...

01:19:49.316 --> 01:19:51.784
- I won't.
- But if you should...

01:19:53.754 --> 01:19:57.155
I've got a saddle
that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe.

01:23:10.918 --> 01:23:12.545
Get under the porch.

01:23:31.338 --> 01:23:32.327
The Gold!

01:23:55.829 --> 01:23:58.855
Lane, come over here!

01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:04.569
- Look.
- Get him out of there.

01:24:11.011 --> 01:24:12.137
Mule!

01:24:21.555 --> 01:24:23.079
Something new!

01:24:27.561 --> 01:24:28.755
Nail him!

01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:52.016
- Quit worrying about that damn mule!
- It's not! It's the woman!

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:58.384
Look at that. They can't last
under there much longer.

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:04.787
- We're going to have to rush them.
- What good would that do?

01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:16.467
Get the horse.

01:25:41.168 --> 01:25:42.499
Come a-running!

01:25:53.347 --> 01:25:56.407
- Are you hit?
- No. I'm all right.

01:26:31.218 --> 01:26:32.879
Go on! Throw it!

01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:31.275
Much obliged.

01:28:46.753 --> 01:28:48.277
Go ahead, tell her.

01:28:50.357 --> 01:28:51.654
Go on.

01:28:52.793 --> 01:28:56.285
Ma'am, it's about the reward.
You see, we've been thinking...

01:28:56.763 --> 01:28:59.266
if you go turn that gold
in to the railroad...

01:28:59.366 --> 01:29:03.166
there ain't going to be nothing left
for you and the boy to live on.

01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:08.104
We've decided we want you
to have that $50,000.

01:29:10.477 --> 01:29:12.240
I couldn't do that.

01:29:12.879 --> 01:29:16.576
It's the only thing you can do.
We've already made up our minds.

01:29:17.484 --> 01:29:21.079
- Ain't that right, Lane?
- That's right.

01:29:26.827 --> 01:29:28.158
Thank you.

01:29:56.923 --> 01:30:00.825
That was very touching, boys,
giving up that reward money.

01:30:02.462 --> 01:30:05.522
- Who are you?
- I work for Wells Fargo.

01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:15.435
- Pinkerton man?
- That's right.

01:30:15.809 --> 01:30:18.607
I've been tracking Matt Lowe
for five years.

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.471
- He's dead.
- I know.

01:30:23.817 --> 01:30:28.311
I was there the night he got shot
in that, shall we say, house of ill repute?

01:30:29.022 --> 01:30:32.480
So was the woman. She worked there.

01:30:33.793 --> 01:30:35.395
Mrs. Lowe?

01:30:35.495 --> 01:30:38.623
Her name is Lilly, with two L's.

01:30:39.099 --> 01:30:41.192
Matt Lowe was never married.

01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.533
Better luck next time!

01:30:51.912 --> 01:30:53.209
Lilly?

01:30:54.281 --> 01:30:55.612
With two L's.

01:30:56.917 --> 01:30:59.351
One of them must stand for "liar."

01:31:02.322 --> 01:31:03.557
Where are you going?

01:31:03.657 --> 01:31:06.592
Where the hell do you suppose?
To rob a train!

01:31:07.227 --> 01:31:11.129
- To rob a train?
- It's something to do.

01:31:49.202 --> 01:31:50.191
