00:03.636 --> 00:06.137
Well, this week on <i>tool time,</i>
it's "what's new?"

00:06.138 --> 00:08.206
What's new with you, al?
That lint?

00:08.207 --> 00:11.242
No, that's always been there,
hasn't it? New shirt? New... No.

00:11.243 --> 00:14.012
Well, tim, what's new
with binford is that
they've just come up

00:14.013 --> 00:17.716
With a brand-new
exterior wood filler.

00:17.717 --> 00:21.285
It's a quick-drying latex blend
that will fill holes...

00:21.286 --> 00:23.121
...Of any size.
Hm.

00:23.122 --> 00:26.390
Like this one
back here?
Tim.

00:26.391 --> 00:28.627
We'll be using it today
on the door and wood frame.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.761
That's right.

00:29.762 --> 00:32.797
Just a little bit can
cover up scratches, nicks,

00:32.798 --> 00:33.932
Any hole you have
in that door.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.567
A little dab'll do ya.

00:39.605 --> 00:42.741
That's a pretty hip reference,
al... Or is it daddy-o?

00:42.742 --> 00:47.012
How about a hula-hoop?
Let's get some bell-bottoms.
Come on.

00:47.013 --> 00:49.814
And we're also proud
to introduce to you this -

00:49.815 --> 00:53.384
Binford's anodized
aluminum kick plate.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.286
Kick plate? Hm.

00:55.287 --> 00:59.824
Maybe something
you should install
in the rear of your pants.

00:59.825 --> 01:04.763
Very often in the humid days,
sometimes the door will
wedge itself shut,

01:04.763 --> 01:07.265
So you end up holding groceries
coming in, you start kicking it.

01:07.266 --> 01:10.001
"honey!"

01:10.002 --> 01:12.971
Resulting in these
unsightly kick marks.
Exactly.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.840
But those are a memory now
because of the kick plate
we've got.

01:15.841 --> 01:18.043
<i>(kick plate twangs)</i>

01:29.388 --> 01:31.389
Installed at the bottom
of the door now,

01:31.390 --> 01:34.659
Now you can kick till you're
blue in the foot and it won't
damage the door.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.261
Why don't you
give it a shot, al?

01:37.262 --> 01:38.496
Ok.

01:38.497 --> 01:40.031
Yeah, well.

01:40.032 --> 01:43.334
You can give it a kick.
Let's show how much abuse
it can have.

01:43.335 --> 01:44.969
Honey!

01:44.970 --> 01:48.173
Honey! Wilma!

03:03.816 --> 03:05.950
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:09.721 --> 03:11.455
Good night, klaus.
Good night, you guys.
<i>(kick plate twangs)</i>

03:11.456 --> 03:13.291
Night, al.
Hey, tim.

03:13.292 --> 03:15.827
Are you busy
this weekend?
Yeah.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.896
Look, I really need a favor.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.597
I'm thinking of
buying some property.

03:19.598 --> 03:20.999
In my neighborhood?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.967
No. No.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.769
Good. See you.

03:24.770 --> 03:27.605
But marv wants to sell me
his place up at saginaw bay.

03:27.606 --> 03:29.908
And I was hoping you could come
and take look at it with me.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.876
Saginaw bay?
I've got relatives up there.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.578
They got real expensive
homes up there, al.
Well...

03:34.579 --> 03:36.915
How many bedrooms
does marv have?
No bedrooms.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.350
How many bathrooms?
No baths.

03:39.351 --> 03:41.820
Remind me not to stand
too close to marv.

03:41.821 --> 03:45.456
It's an ice-fishing
shanty.
A shanty?

03:45.457 --> 03:47.625
Yeah, you know, it's a house.
Sits right there on the lake,

03:47.626 --> 03:50.895
And you can fish right through
a hole in the floor.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.664
What kind of ice you fishing
for? Cubed, crushed?

03:53.665 --> 03:56.567
Well, I...

03:56.568 --> 03:58.669
I really would
value your opinion.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.671
I can give it to you right now.
You wanna buy a shack

04:00.672 --> 04:03.174
With no bedrooms, no baths,
that sits on a frozen lake.

04:03.175 --> 04:06.845
Let me just type that in
the old real estate computer.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.814
The answer's coming up...
Don't buy it.

04:09.815 --> 04:12.016
Tim, I'd really like you
to look at it with me.

04:12.017 --> 04:16.654
Besides, we can
spend some time together, talk
a little, catch some fish...

04:16.654 --> 04:18.522
But why are you asking me?
Why don't you ask ilene?

04:18.523 --> 04:20.325
Marv needs an answer
by this weekend,

04:20.326 --> 04:22.526
And ilene's gonna be
at your house Saturday.

04:22.527 --> 04:24.795
What?

04:24.796 --> 04:27.498
Yeah. Jill invited the gals
over to watch musicals.

04:27.499 --> 04:29.633
"the gals over"?

04:29.634 --> 04:31.702
Was that this weekend
she did that?

04:31.703 --> 04:34.873
Yeah, yeah, and they're
gonna talk about their guys.

04:34.874 --> 04:39.077
And they said something about
removing unnecessary body hair.

04:40.812 --> 04:44.916
Ugh. <i>(coughs)</i>

04:44.917 --> 04:49.420
What time you wanna
pick me up?
How's 5:30 am?

04:49.421 --> 04:53.024
You stop by at 5:30am,
I'll remove your
unnecessary body hair.

04:54.326 --> 04:57.929
Ice fishing in January.
We are so jealous.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.531
Dad, did you hear
what the weatherman said?

05:00.532 --> 05:03.234
He said it's gonna be
seven below zero.

05:03.235 --> 05:05.904
Thank you,
mr. Thermometer.

05:05.905 --> 05:08.306
Yeah, and that's
the high.

05:08.307 --> 05:11.642
It's not gonna be that bad.
Marv's shanty is real custom.

05:11.643 --> 05:16.214
He's got insulation, a heater,
bunks, shelves, the works.
It's a real cool place.

05:16.215 --> 05:20.751
You know, I'd better make room
in the freezer for all the fish
dad's gonna catch.

05:23.155 --> 05:26.690
That should do it.

05:26.691 --> 05:31.562
You guys gotta stop teasing me.
I'm starting to get real upset.
I wish you'd stop it.

05:31.563 --> 05:35.133
I don't care what you say.
I'd rather be ice fishing
anytime

05:35.134 --> 05:38.502
Than be stuck here
with women and these.

05:38.503 --> 05:41.139
<i>Gigi.</i>

05:41.140 --> 05:43.141
<i>Funny girl.</i>
<i>(fake laugh)</i>

05:45.311 --> 05:47.611
<i>The king and I.</i>
Come on.

05:47.612 --> 05:50.214
Dad, what's <i>the king and I?</i>

05:50.215 --> 05:54.385
It's some film about elvis.

05:54.386 --> 05:56.354
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:56.355 --> 05:59.590
<i>(jill)</i> I'll get it.
Hi, al.
Morning.

05:59.591 --> 06:02.126
Ilene! How come
you're here so early?
Hi.

06:02.127 --> 06:06.697
I just wanted to drop al
off so I could see him until
the last possible second.

06:06.698 --> 06:08.766
That's so sweet.

06:09.935 --> 06:12.837
You want some coffee?
Thanks.

06:16.008 --> 06:19.177
Nice hat. Did you
drive or fly over?

06:21.046 --> 06:24.349
I'm really excited about
our girls-only party.
Can I bring anything?

06:24.350 --> 06:26.084
How about some men?

06:26.085 --> 06:28.919
You want some cream?
Yes, please.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.921
Well, I know
it's just one day,

06:30.922 --> 06:33.057
But I hope you won't
forget the al man.

06:33.058 --> 06:36.327
I'll be thinking of you
the whole time.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.762
And I wanna know everything
that happens while you're
up there, ok?

06:38.763 --> 06:42.200
I certainly hope you won't
forget the tim man.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.602
I'll keep
the oilcan ready.

06:46.171 --> 06:50.241
Have a good time.
See you later.
Guys, group hug.

06:50.242 --> 06:53.111
Oh, man.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.146
Dad, we're too old
for this.

06:55.147 --> 06:57.382
You're too old
for a group hug?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.117
It's back to
individual ones, then.

07:10.095 --> 07:13.697
<i>(tim)</i> structurally, the thing
looks real sound, al.
<i>(al)</i> yeah.

07:16.001 --> 07:19.037
Oh, this is great!

07:26.045 --> 07:28.913
This is marv's idea
of a vacation?

07:28.914 --> 07:31.215
Remind me not to
use his travel agent.

07:31.216 --> 07:34.585
I think this is
paradise on ice.

07:34.586 --> 07:36.521
Well, why don't you
go unpack

07:36.522 --> 07:39.590
And I'll putter around here
in the living room?

07:40.926 --> 07:44.529
Aw, come on, tim.
Before you put it down,

07:44.530 --> 07:47.031
I think maybe you
should just relax

07:47.032 --> 07:50.868
And enjoy the whole
ice-fishing experience.

07:50.869 --> 07:53.771
You're right, al.
I'll unpack my fishing gear,

07:53.772 --> 07:56.840
<i>Hot rod</i> magazines,

07:56.841 --> 07:58.576
Radio,

07:58.577 --> 08:02.012
And my little personal tv.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.883
You brought a tv?
You betcha.

08:05.884 --> 08:09.387
Maybe we could watch
<i>gilligan's island,</i>

08:09.388 --> 08:13.124
See how seven people feel
about being stranded
in the middle of nowhere.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.093
Aw, come on, tim.

08:15.094 --> 08:19.063
Oh-ho, and I brought
something for you.

08:19.064 --> 08:20.364
Yeah? What's that?

08:20.365 --> 08:23.334
Binford's new
guy on the go toiletries.

08:23.335 --> 08:26.370
Hand cleaner.
It'll get off any smell.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.373
Smells like sawdust.

08:29.374 --> 08:31.409
I like it.

08:34.413 --> 08:37.948
All right! Well, ha-ha!

08:37.948 --> 08:39.883
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready to fish.

08:39.884 --> 08:42.186
How about it?

08:42.187 --> 08:45.423
Oh, boy. Looks like
we're frozen over here.

08:45.424 --> 08:48.459
We'll come back
this summer.
Aw, come on, tim.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.496
Why don't you chisel a hole
and I'll bait the hooks?

08:51.497 --> 08:55.032
I could use a crowbar.
You got a crowbar.
I got a chisel right here.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.368
All right.
Small hole, huh?

08:57.369 --> 08:59.504
Uh-huh, yeah,
that ought to do us.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.071
Oh, boy.

09:19.824 --> 09:22.826
Were you real attached
to that chisel?

09:25.063 --> 09:29.933
Tim, that... That chisel's been
in my family for generations!

09:29.934 --> 09:33.671
That was handed down to me
by my great-grandfather
hal borland.

09:33.672 --> 09:36.240
Well, it's not like
it was new.

09:42.514 --> 09:47.518
<i>(marie)</i> how long we gotta
keep this stuff on?
Oh, just another minute.

09:54.793 --> 09:58.462
That was such a good movie.
I'm rewinding.

09:58.463 --> 10:00.198
I love <i>gigi.</i>

10:00.199 --> 10:03.033
Why can't life be like that?
You're always in France,

10:03.034 --> 10:05.203
You drink champagne
and you sing.

10:05.204 --> 10:09.273
My life is a lot like gigi's.
Except I live in detroit,

10:09.274 --> 10:12.443
Drink diet soda
and my husband grunts.

10:12.444 --> 10:15.045
What do you wanna
watch next? Oh, wait!

10:15.046 --> 10:17.715
I brought <i>the long, hot summer</i>
with paul newman.

10:17.716 --> 10:20.884
I love paul newman.
Me too.

10:20.885 --> 10:23.588
Doesn't paul newman
remind you of al?

10:25.924 --> 10:28.659
<i>(timer rings)</i>
we're bleached.
Let's go!

10:28.660 --> 10:30.828
Oh, that's good.
It stings.

10:30.829 --> 10:33.764
Well, ilene, I'm glad to hear
that romance isn't dead.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.833
I remember when my husband
was romantic.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.868
Everyday when joe came home
from the slaughterhouse,

10:37.869 --> 10:39.870
He'd bring me a heart-shaped
hamburger patty

10:39.871 --> 10:41.872
Really?

10:41.873 --> 10:45.343
Tim is at his most romantic
during the dollar-day sale
at sears.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.979
All I gotta do is wear
a negligee and hold up
a tool catalog.

10:48.980 --> 10:53.150
I can't imagine al ever losing
his flair for romance.

10:53.151 --> 10:54.585
That's because you're
still at the stage where

10:54.586 --> 10:57.054
He's serenading you
with violins at dinner.

10:57.055 --> 10:59.624
In six months, the only
serenading you're gonna hear

10:59.625 --> 11:02.593
Is his burping on the way
to the bathroom.

11:02.594 --> 11:06.764
Yeah, and once inside,
there's a serenade you
really don't wanna hear.

11:13.204 --> 11:16.440
<i>(static)</i>

11:16.441 --> 11:18.476
The reception's
terrible in here.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.645
I can't tell whether gilligan
got 'em off the island

11:20.646 --> 11:22.780
Or the pistons
are about to score.

11:22.781 --> 11:24.882
Someone's driving the lane.
Go, go!

11:24.883 --> 11:28.719
It's thurston howell. "lovey,
I just slammed the ball, lovey.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.821
Come here and give me
a big smackeroonie, lovey."

11:30.822 --> 11:33.557
Come on, tim.
We're here to fish.

11:33.558 --> 11:35.125
Don't tell me.
Tell the fish.

11:35.126 --> 11:37.194
We've been here four hours
without a bite.

11:37.195 --> 11:40.864
You know, there's a lot more to
fishing than just catching fish.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.000
It's about being out
in the wilderness,

11:43.001 --> 11:46.771
Getting away from our women
and our job,

11:46.772 --> 11:49.239
Just men spending
time together.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.578
Al, we spend
all day together.

11:54.579 --> 11:57.948
Yeah, but we never get
a chance to talk that often.

11:57.949 --> 12:00.351
You wanna talk?
Let's talk.

12:00.352 --> 12:03.153
I'll turn the sound down.

12:03.154 --> 12:04.755
You're not gonna
turn it off?

12:04.756 --> 12:09.794
No, I can watch this and listen
to you. I do it with jill
all the time.

12:09.795 --> 12:15.065
Well, you know, there's...
An awful lot going on
in my life right now.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.570
What?

12:21.506 --> 12:25.509
Aw... Well, never mind.
Let's just fish.

12:25.510 --> 12:28.512
All right, halftime.
Hey, why don't we just fish?

12:28.513 --> 12:30.514
Hold this.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.383
What are you doing?

12:32.384 --> 12:36.019
I'm gonna speed up
the process a little bit,
make the hole bigger.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.788
Tim, leave the floor alone.

12:37.789 --> 12:41.392
The hole is fine.
It's a standard-size hole.

12:41.393 --> 12:45.095
Standard-schmandard.
You increase the size
of the hole,

12:45.096 --> 12:46.764
You double your chances
of catching fish.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.799
Perch are not that big.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.735
Look, open the hole,

12:50.736 --> 12:54.071
We might get bigger fish.

12:54.072 --> 12:55.539
I don't think you
should do this, tim.

12:55.540 --> 12:59.142
Trust me, al.
Oh, my god!

12:59.143 --> 13:01.812
Tim! Tim!

13:01.813 --> 13:03.080
Tim!

13:03.081 --> 13:04.882
Oh, tim!

13:08.687 --> 13:11.822
Jeez! You know, though,
once you get in there,

13:11.823 --> 13:13.691
It's kind of exhilarating.

13:26.037 --> 13:28.906
There.
Are you warmer now?
Thanks.

13:28.907 --> 13:33.844
I can't believe you came up here
without a change of clothes.

13:33.845 --> 13:37.715
Well, I didn't intend on
falling through the ice, al.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.950
Everybody knows that when you
come on a trip like this,

13:39.951 --> 13:43.086
You have to plan for
every possible contingency.

13:43.087 --> 13:48.191
And with you,
every contingency is possible.

13:48.192 --> 13:51.595
Well, this contingency
is your fault.

13:51.596 --> 13:56.066
Fine. Just lucky that I brought
an extra set of clothes.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.001
Oh, yeah. Real lucky.

14:11.082 --> 14:15.218
What is this?
"one size fits al"?

14:15.219 --> 14:18.088
Just... Here, give me
the keys to the car.

14:18.089 --> 14:21.224
I'll take this stuff
and get the car warmed up.
Gladly.

14:21.225 --> 14:23.928
You know, tim, I was
hoping that this trip

14:23.929 --> 14:26.730
We could relax and talk
on a more personal level.

14:26.731 --> 14:29.800
How much more personal can we
get? I'm wearing your underwear.

14:29.801 --> 14:34.772
What I meant was talk about
our hopes, our fears...

14:38.443 --> 14:41.011
You didn't lose
the car keys, did you?

14:41.012 --> 14:43.981
I hope I didn't,

14:43.982 --> 14:46.817
But I fear I did.

14:49.554 --> 14:52.322
Do you wanna go in?
I've already been in.

14:59.664 --> 15:01.298
Yeow!

15:01.299 --> 15:05.536
I thought you said waxing
your legs didn't hurt that much.
Ow!

15:05.537 --> 15:09.773
Oh, it gets easier every time
you do it. <i>(grunts)</i>

15:12.143 --> 15:15.779
Marie, you're dipping the bread
in the hot wax!

15:15.780 --> 15:18.215
This is the fondue.

15:20.886 --> 15:25.389
That's all right.
I'll take it home to joe.
He'll eat anything.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.725
So, you're on
a desert island.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.093
You can be with one man
for the rest of your life.

15:30.094 --> 15:31.529
Who do you pick?

15:31.530 --> 15:34.431
Al.

15:34.432 --> 15:37.401
You can't pick somebody
you know. This is a fantasy.

15:37.402 --> 15:39.603
Come on, ilene.
Live a little.

15:39.604 --> 15:41.171
All right.

15:41.172 --> 15:44.041
There is somebody I have always
had a little thing for,

15:44.042 --> 15:48.345
One of the sexiest men of
all time - pierre fouchard.

15:48.346 --> 15:50.147
Ooh, that sounds hot.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.115
Is he some kind of
french actor or something?

15:52.116 --> 15:54.317
No. He was the father
of modern dentistry.

15:54.318 --> 15:57.487
That would've been
my second guess.

15:57.488 --> 15:59.957
He has a beard
just like al's. Ow!

15:59.958 --> 16:02.259
You like beards, huh?
Mm-hm.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.894
Me, I'm a tush girl.

16:03.895 --> 16:07.064
Did you ever see the buns
on baryshnikov?

16:07.065 --> 16:08.999
Very nice buns.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.036
But I like a man
who makes me laugh.

16:12.037 --> 16:15.873
I think that the perfect man
is harpo marx.

16:18.342 --> 16:21.845
No, he's hilarious
and he never says a word.

16:23.414 --> 16:26.483
Aah!
Ow!

16:30.855 --> 16:33.857
Well, there's, uh,
no sign of wilson,

16:33.858 --> 16:35.793
But it's so dark out there,
how could you tell?

16:35.794 --> 16:38.428
Tim, what are you doing?

16:38.429 --> 16:44.068
I'm using my know-how
to double the heat
out of this thing.

16:44.069 --> 16:48.906
Would that be the same know-how
you used to double the size of
the hole?

16:48.907 --> 16:51.575
This'll be great.
Marv will love it.

16:51.576 --> 16:55.079
I wish you wouldn't fiddle
with these things.
Ah...

16:55.080 --> 16:57.982
<i>(wilson)</i> hi-ho,
stranded neighbors.

16:59.851 --> 17:02.987
Come on in, wilson.
Hey, wilson.

17:02.988 --> 17:07.290
Oh, thanks for driving up.
Mm-hm. All right, tim,
here's your extra set of keys.

17:07.290 --> 17:10.193
Thanks.
Here's an old pair
of my shoes.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.929
All right.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.131
Where did you get
these fish?

17:19.804 --> 17:22.472
Well, when I was
looking for your shanty,

17:22.473 --> 17:24.842
I found some very nice people
whose cooler was overflowing.

17:24.843 --> 17:28.812
You know, they say the fishing's
the best it's been up here
in 12 years.

17:28.813 --> 17:33.550
I do not understand why we
have not caught any fish.

17:33.551 --> 17:37.320
What is that
rather pungent aroma?

17:37.321 --> 17:40.958
Oh, it's tim's hand cleaner
over there.

17:40.959 --> 17:44.294
Tim, I think I can explain
to you why you didn't catch
anything.

17:44.295 --> 17:45.929
You know, it's
a well-known fact

17:45.930 --> 17:48.498
That fish are attracted
to bait by the scent.

17:48.499 --> 17:52.169
However, if the bait
is overridden with
a more powerful smell

17:52.170 --> 17:56.907
Such as cologne or hand cleaner
that smells like... Sawdust?

17:56.908 --> 18:00.343
Then instead,
the fish are repelled.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.349
Nice going, tim.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.951
You said you liked
the smell of that.

18:07.952 --> 18:10.187
Well, I'm not a fish!

18:10.188 --> 18:14.491
Well, I think I'll just...
Go pack the gear up in the car

18:14.492 --> 18:16.426
And, uh...

18:16.427 --> 18:18.062
Oh, well, here.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.530
We don't wanna forget
your precious tv.

18:20.531 --> 18:24.201
Maybe you'll get better
reception on the way home.

18:27.839 --> 18:32.176
Trouble on the ice, tim?
Yeah, the husky's
misbehaving.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.945
Well, that's too bad.

18:34.946 --> 18:37.614
A trip like this ought to
be a good opportunity

18:37.615 --> 18:39.349
For men to spend
some time together,

18:39.350 --> 18:43.220
Talk, share some laughs.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.222
That's all he wanted to do
was talk.

18:45.223 --> 18:47.057
Oh, what did you
talk about?

18:47.058 --> 18:50.427
I don't know.
I wasn't listening to him.

18:50.428 --> 18:53.964
Well, it doesn't sound like
you were being very receptive.

18:53.965 --> 18:56.566
What kind of guy
wants to be outdoors

18:56.567 --> 18:58.736
And listen to another man
talk about what's bugging him?

18:58.737 --> 19:01.304
Like you and I do
in the backyard?

19:01.305 --> 19:03.073
<i>(grunts)</i>

19:05.744 --> 19:09.546
You see, tim, friendship
is a symbiotic relationship.

19:09.547 --> 19:11.782
Two people have to
contribute equally.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.250
Yeah, but it's different
with you and me.

19:13.251 --> 19:16.720
Well, why is it different?

19:16.721 --> 19:19.456
There's a fence.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.358
Well, fence or no fence,

19:21.359 --> 19:22.860
I think al just
wanted you to listen.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.530
Thanks again, wilson,
for coming all the way up.

19:27.531 --> 19:30.734
We'll meet you at your car.
We'll all caravan home.

19:30.735 --> 19:32.836
Ok, yes, indeed.

19:34.338 --> 19:37.107
Have you got everything?
Almost.

19:37.108 --> 19:39.709
You know,
a little while ago

19:39.710 --> 19:42.445
You were talking about how
your life's become real full.

19:42.446 --> 19:44.447
What were you
talking about?

19:44.448 --> 19:46.049
Tim, I don't wanna
talk about it now.

19:46.050 --> 19:47.384
Oh, come on.

19:47.385 --> 19:51.221
Good friendships
are kumbayatic.

19:54.926 --> 19:58.495
You wanna sing camp songs?

19:58.496 --> 20:01.298
I was just wondering... How long
you been dating ilene now?

20:01.299 --> 20:02.666
It's gotta be five months,
right?

20:02.667 --> 20:06.569
Well, actually,
it's four months and 13 days.

20:06.570 --> 20:09.706
Yeah, actually, you know...
Well, with you and jill,

20:09.707 --> 20:13.710
How long was it before you
realized she was the one?

20:13.711 --> 20:16.847
When she told me.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.782
<i>(al)</i> you turned off
the heater, right?

20:18.783 --> 20:20.383
What do you think I am,
an idiot?

20:30.962 --> 20:32.896
Hi.
Hi.

20:32.897 --> 20:35.699
How was your trip?
Good.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.137
How was your
hair-removal party?

20:40.138 --> 20:43.941
Well, you be the judge.

20:43.942 --> 20:46.310
<i>(grunts)</i>

20:46.311 --> 20:49.746
You missed a little patch
right here.
I did not.

20:51.282 --> 20:53.783
So, all your fish
are in here?

20:53.784 --> 20:57.520
Actually, I had al keep 'em
in his refrigerator.

20:57.521 --> 20:59.756
You didn't catch any,
did you?

20:59.757 --> 21:01.992
Not even when I fell in.

21:03.561 --> 21:06.930
You fell in?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.732
Well, what happened?
Tell me all about it.

21:08.733 --> 21:10.600
I don't wanna talk about it.

21:14.472 --> 21:17.540
I spent the last two-and-a-half
hours driving with al,

21:17.541 --> 21:19.943
Talking with him about
everything - boyhood memories,

21:19.944 --> 21:23.513
His relationship with ilene,
even why he wears flannel.

21:23.514 --> 21:25.582
Why does he wear flannel?

21:25.583 --> 21:27.484
It's kind of a neat story,
really.

21:27.485 --> 21:30.220
When his dad had his workshop
behind the house, it was very
cold.

21:30.221 --> 21:33.790
When al was a little kid he came
out and worked and his dad put
these flannel shirts on him.

21:33.791 --> 21:37.194
I think that's nice
that you two shared so much.

21:37.195 --> 21:40.931
Did you help him decide
whether he should buy
marv's shanty?

21:40.932 --> 21:42.866
Yeah.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.436
What did he decide?

21:46.437 --> 21:48.138
What did he decide?
He, um...

21:48.139 --> 21:50.007
Uh...

21:50.008 --> 21:51.708
He figured that
since it burned down,

21:51.709 --> 21:55.312
It wasn't a good time
to buy it.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.248
Did you burn down
marv's shanty?

21:58.249 --> 21:59.917
What is it with you?
I walk through the door,

21:59.918 --> 22:02.986
You immediately accuse me
of burning it down.
Why? Why? Why?

22:02.987 --> 22:04.054
Tim...

22:04.055 --> 22:06.156
Right to the ground.
Right...

22:07.992 --> 22:10.160
Ashes.
Oh, no.

22:10.161 --> 22:14.998
I'm sure he's got an insurance
policy that covers a shanty
clause in there.

22:14.999 --> 22:19.202
Tim, there is no such thing
as shanty clause.

22:20.771 --> 22:25.175
Well, it'll be all right.
Marv and I go way back.

22:25.176 --> 22:27.577
He'll understand.

22:47.598 --> 22:49.232
Oh, boy!

22:50.634 --> 22:53.636
This fondue'll put hair
on your chest.

22:55.473 --> 22:57.240
No, tim.

22:57.241 --> 23:00.277
This fondue will take
the hair right off your chest.

23:11.889 --> 23:13.190
What is this?

23:18.729 --> 23:20.663
"one size..." <i>(laughs)</i>
