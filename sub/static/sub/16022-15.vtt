WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:07.439
(wind blowing)

00:37.404 --> 00:40.105
(dog barks in distance)

00:53.253 --> 00:55.320
(buzzes)

01:11.538 --> 01:13.605
(siren approaching)

01:20.280 --> 01:21.847
Stokes:
Man, do you know
how close I was

01:21.849 --> 01:23.515
To being off the
clock when you called?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.551
Yeah, I thought about
waiting ten minutes,

01:25.553 --> 01:26.685
Dumping it on
the day shift,

01:26.687 --> 01:27.853
But for the victim's sake

01:27.855 --> 01:29.488
I thought we'd go with
the "a" team.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.324
Oh, boy,
she looks really young.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.725
Crawford:
16. Just got her license.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.727
Name's debbie logan.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.263
Nevada plates.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.531
Is she local?

01:39.533 --> 01:40.866
Crawford:
Let's see, the address
is in rowan.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.469
That's, what,
another 30 miles out?

01:43.471 --> 01:46.705
Yeah. Car's registered
to her parents, same address.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.574
No money,

01:48.576 --> 01:49.608
No phone...

01:49.610 --> 01:51.276
Could've started as a robbery.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.879
Yeah, someone whacked her
in the head real good.

01:53.881 --> 01:57.349
But I don't think it happened
in the car.

01:57.351 --> 02:01.620
She was definitely on
the ground at some point.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.555
Her clothes are dirty.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.325
She's got what looks like
blue tinsel in her hair.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.526
Put a call in to her parents.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.596
Thought she was still
in her bed, asleep.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.763
Hmm.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.499
Algebra books,

02:13.501 --> 02:15.334
Bible study books...

02:17.437 --> 02:19.471
I don't think she was a runaway.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.739
Makes you wonder

02:20.741 --> 02:22.574
Where she snuck off to
last night, doesn't it?

02:22.576 --> 02:25.511
Yeah, but what
I really want to know

02:25.513 --> 02:28.680
Is how the hell
she ended up way out here.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.492
♪ who... Are you?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.595
♪ who, who, who, who?

02:43.597 --> 02:46.598

♪ are you!

03:11.891 --> 03:13.926
(sighs)

03:13.928 --> 03:15.260
It always takes
a little out of me

03:15.262 --> 03:17.329
When I see them
this young.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.434
Robbins:
I know what you mean.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.503
And I'm afraid
the story only gets worse.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.505
Phillips:
Found skin under
her fingernails.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.273
I went ahead and ordered
an sae kit.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.508
And...?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.976
Wet mount revealed
the presence of semen.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.878
Robbins:
That, along with

03:32.880 --> 03:35.347
Vaginal bruising and
the abrasions she sustained...

03:35.349 --> 03:37.749
I'd have to say she was
sexually assaulted.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.592
Is this wound
the cause of death?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.393
Blunt force trauma

03:48.395 --> 03:49.995
And the attenuating
brain injuries.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.731
Time of death, somewhere between
midnight and 3:00 a.M.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.732
Any thoughts on a weapon?

03:53.734 --> 03:54.733
The margins

03:54.735 --> 03:56.435
Are irregular and jagged,

03:56.437 --> 03:58.403
So nothing with
a blade or sharp edge.

03:59.839 --> 04:00.973
And this cut on her knee?

04:00.975 --> 04:03.275
Pre-mortem or post?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.643
Well, let's have a look.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.815
There's some sort of
paper fiber stuck to it.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.316
Probably bathroom tissue.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.351
Maybe somebody

04:12.353 --> 04:14.286
Dabbed at it
to stop the bleeding.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.021
In which case,
the cut was certainly

04:16.023 --> 04:18.457
Prior to the fatal blow.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.558
Hold on.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.993
There's
something else.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.594
It's embedded much deeper.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.366
Huh.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.467
Looks like a
piece of glass.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.801
It is.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.503
I'll get this off to hodges.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.317
Robbins:
You-you all right?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.318
Finn?
You all right?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.953
Yeah.
Yeah, just...

04:47.955 --> 04:49.655
Just a...

04:49.657 --> 04:50.989
16-year-old girl

04:50.991 --> 04:52.324
Having to face the horror

04:52.326 --> 04:54.526
Of being raped and killed...

04:56.496 --> 04:58.664
Just never understand it.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.433
Logan: <i>We didn't even know</i>
<i>she was out.</i>

05:01.435 --> 05:03.368
We thought she was still asleep.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.471
And then the detective called.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.606
Was it like your daughter

05:07.608 --> 05:09.374
To sneak out of the house?
No.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.677
Not at all.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.445
Did she say anything last night

05:13.447 --> 05:14.379
Before she went to bed?

05:14.381 --> 05:16.682
I... I-I don't know,

05:16.684 --> 05:17.883
I wasn't there.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.551
I was ministering
to some parishioners.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.387
No, she didn't say anything.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.689
It was just
a normal night.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.590
She did her homework
and she went upstairs.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.426
I don't
understand.

05:28.528 --> 05:29.761
Why would she have
left the house?

05:29.763 --> 05:30.762
Where would
she go?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.364
Did she have a boyfriend?

05:32.366 --> 05:33.565
Logan:
No. She never even

05:33.567 --> 05:35.567
Talked about boys.
That wasn't her thing.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.638
Well, uh... What was her thing?

05:42.875 --> 05:45.344
I don't know.
The usual

05:45.346 --> 05:46.745
For a 16-year-old,
I guess.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.081
She hung out with her friends,
she went to school...

05:49.083 --> 05:51.516
She didn't call to say she was
in any kind of trouble, did she?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.785
Actually...
We have her phone.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.786
We took it from her.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.788
And not because
she was bad.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.523
Her grades
had slipped.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.991
She was supposed
to earn her phone back.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.793
Uh, look,
mr. Russell,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.095
I know what you're thinking.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.563
I minister to families
all the time

06:04.565 --> 06:06.765
Whose kids are out of control.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.101
And that is...

06:09.103 --> 06:11.370
That wasn't debbie.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.437
She worked hard in school,

06:12.439 --> 06:16.074
She taught bible study
to the preschoolers.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.143
She really was an angel.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.654
♪

06:38.898 --> 06:41.733
Seatback to pedal is 44 inches.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.469
Way too far back for
our victim's height.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.905
Whoever dumped the body
probably adjusted the seat.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.108
Judging from the distance,
around six feet.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.745
Pull any prints off the button
that controls the seat?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.114
No, so far
everything's been smeared.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.850
I'm guessing either
the killer was wearing gloves,

06:58.852 --> 07:00.952
Or he wiped everything down
before he bailed.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.792
It rained yesterday, right?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.560
Sanders:
Yeah. For a while.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.629
This flyer isn't
weathered or faded.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.197
Might have been put
on the car last night.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.199
"3.99 breakfast
special.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.668
Patty's diner."
here we go.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.571
Finally.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.173
You got a print?

07:21.175 --> 07:22.941
Yeah, big
and juicy.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.076
Could be from the last person

07:25.078 --> 07:26.144
Who touched the car.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.914
The killer.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.550
(machine humming)

07:31.552 --> 07:33.185
Finlay:
Hey.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.820
I know what you're
going to say.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.188
"I want to be dazzled."

07:36.190 --> 07:37.823
Oh, let's not set
the bar that high.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.924
What do you
know about

07:38.926 --> 07:39.925
The glass fragment?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.693
Well, for starters, it's old.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.928
Oh, how old?

07:42.930 --> 07:44.496
Hodges:
At least 100 years.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.499
Revealed a significant
amount of manganese.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.867
And manganese
was eliminated

07:48.869 --> 07:50.101
From the
glass-making process

07:50.103 --> 07:52.204
Prior to the start of
the first world war.

07:52.206 --> 07:56.174
Manganese glass is actually
clear when it's produced,

07:56.176 --> 07:58.577
But then over time,
sunlight turns it purple.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.945
What else?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.481
Well, the glass
fragment is curved.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.915
And extrapolating
from the curve,

08:03.917 --> 08:06.585
I have determined
that your piece

08:06.587 --> 08:08.520
Came from a bottle
with a base radius

08:08.522 --> 08:09.855
Of a little over an inch...

08:09.857 --> 08:13.758
Something like one of these
apothecary bottles.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.560
Not bad, hodges.
Hey, guys.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.697
I processed the semen from
the sexual assault kit.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.699
Semen dna
matches dna

08:20.701 --> 08:22.667
From the tissue found under
the victim's fingernails.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.769
So she fought off
her attacker.
Yeah, but

08:24.771 --> 08:26.505
The dna profile
isn't in the system.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.506
Sorry.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.140
Oh... Me, too.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.609
Sanders: Were the
parents any help

08:30.611 --> 08:31.910
Figuring out where
their daughter was?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.778
They weren't, actually.
It's kind of strange.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.581
I never got any sense of
connection from them.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.117
I mean, the father's out on
church business all the time,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.719
But-but the mother...

08:40.721 --> 08:41.953
She didn't seem to have a clue

08:41.955 --> 08:43.688
About who her
daughter really was.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.590
Well, we may have something...

08:45.592 --> 08:47.759
I found a print on
the passenger-side door handle

08:47.761 --> 08:49.261
Of the victim's car.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.730
It matches a set of prints
on this flyer.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.299
Well, someone might've tried

08:54.301 --> 08:56.101
To break into the victim's car
last night.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.904
You know, guy goes around
putting flyers on windshields.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.805
<i>Gives him</i>
<i>the perfect opportunity</i>

09:00.807 --> 09:02.173
<i>To check inside for valuables.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:04.175
<i>Well, I'm thinking</i>
<i>that he saw something</i>

09:04.177 --> 09:05.544
<i>Inside the victim's car,</i>

09:05.546 --> 09:06.611
<i>Because he tried the handle.</i>

09:06.613 --> 09:07.612
Debbie:
Hey! What're you doing?

09:07.614 --> 09:08.680
Get away from my car!

09:08.682 --> 09:09.915
(grunts)

09:11.817 --> 09:13.785
(debbie screams)

09:15.055 --> 09:17.556
Talked to your boss
at the diner.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.057
She said that
she pays you

09:19.059 --> 09:20.325
An extra $50 bucks a week

09:20.327 --> 09:21.793
To distribute flyers
after work each night.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.628
Crawford:
That's not a bad way to make

09:23.630 --> 09:24.796
A little extra scratch, huh?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.065
Every little bit
helps, you know?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.266
But you also found another way

09:28.268 --> 09:29.634
To make some extra scratch,
didn't you?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.269
You lost me, man.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.671
I don't know what you mean.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.641
Crawford:
All of these were in
the trunk of your car.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.276
And my guess is,
when we search your apartment,

09:38.278 --> 09:39.277
We're gonna find

09:39.279 --> 09:40.579
A whole
lot more.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.213
Sanders:
It's a big step though,

09:42.215 --> 09:44.215
Going from breaking into cars

09:44.217 --> 09:45.817
To rape and murder.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.885
What are you
talking about, man?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.219
I never hurt
anybody.

09:48.221 --> 09:52.090
You did more than
just hurt her, ernesto.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.825
Hell no, man!

09:53.827 --> 09:54.993
You got the wrong guy.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.061
I didn't do that.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.228
Sanders:
You left your fingerprints

09:57.230 --> 09:58.630
On her car door handle

09:58.632 --> 09:59.764
And the flyer.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.232
That's how
we found you.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.767
And when your dna
comes back a match

10:02.769 --> 10:04.803
To what we found on that girl...

10:07.073 --> 10:08.840
Fine.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.642
Fine, you want to test me?

10:10.644 --> 10:11.676
Test me!

10:11.678 --> 10:12.877
You'll see,
you're wrong.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.847
I did not
do that.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.983
I didn't even break into
any cars last night.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.684
Then why did we find
your fingerprint

10:19.686 --> 10:20.986
On her car door?

10:23.923 --> 10:26.291
I might've stopped at,
like, one place

10:26.293 --> 10:27.926
On the way home.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.027
All right?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.128
There were maybe
a dozen cars,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.863
But nothing in
there worth stealing,

10:31.865 --> 10:33.665
So I tossed
the flyers

10:33.667 --> 10:36.201
In a trash can
and went home, man.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.903
Please, man,
I'm telling you the truth.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.674
Okay, where is this place?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.410
Some building, man,
off the highway, man,

10:45.412 --> 10:46.711
Way out in brime county.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.948
How about you tell us
exactly where?

11:13.906 --> 11:16.107
What is this place?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.776
I don't know.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.145
I don't see any signs.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.713
Stokes: Yeah, and I don't see
any restaurant flyers

11:21.715 --> 11:23.081
On any of these cars, either.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.784
Well,

11:25.786 --> 11:28.453
Ernesto said he left
most of the in the trash.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.461
No, empty.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.797
You know, maybe this guy
is just jerking us around.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.302
Then again,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.304
Maybe he's not.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.310
Well, what do you think?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.912
Should we check it out?

11:57.116 --> 11:59.718
All right.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.186
(doorbell buzzes)

12:07.760 --> 12:09.227
You must be the harris brothers?

12:10.931 --> 12:14.399
Yeah, well,
there was no traffic, so...

12:27.346 --> 12:28.780
I'll take you guys in.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.148
Suzanne will probably be
a couple of minutes,

12:30.150 --> 12:32.884
But you can get started
on your selections.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.859
There was a piece of this
in the victim's hair.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.894
She was here.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.130
(music playing softly)

12:45.132 --> 12:48.833
Now, I can take your drink
order whenever you like.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.835
Just let me know,
but in the meantime...

12:50.837 --> 12:54.472
...Why don't you have
a look at your choices?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.244
(indistinct chatter)

13:06.185 --> 13:08.119
Stokes:
Well,

13:08.121 --> 13:10.155
So much
for our wholesome little girl.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.957
Teenage bible studies teacher

13:12.959 --> 13:14.926
Spent her last night alive
in a brothel.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.569
(giggling, indistinct chatter)

13:25.805 --> 13:27.405
Hi.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.406
Sorry, ladies,

13:28.408 --> 13:29.574
But, uh,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.142
We're here on business.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.944
You know, we have
a law enforcement discount

13:32.946 --> 13:34.579
Every day until 10:00.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.880
That's good to know,

13:35.882 --> 13:37.549
But, uh, not today.

13:37.551 --> 13:41.085
You must see something here
that you're interested in.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.453
(door closes)

13:42.455 --> 13:44.889
We don't want to waste
your time, ladies.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.090
This isn't gonna happen.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.927
(sighs)
I'm serious.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.461
Woman:
You heard him, girls.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.897
(indistinct chatter)

13:54.200 --> 13:56.000
Gentlemen.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.603
Clearly,
you're not the harris brothers.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.505
We're csis;
we're from las vegas.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.241
We have reason to believe
that there was a young girl here

14:03.243 --> 14:05.109
Last night named debbie.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.411
16 years old.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.580
This is a legal,
licensed brothel.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.849
Having a minor on the premises

14:10.851 --> 14:11.916
Would be against the law.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.320
Would you mind taking
a look at her photo?

14:15.322 --> 14:17.021
Sure.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.091
She wasn't here.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.893
Don't suppose there are any,

14:21.895 --> 14:23.027
Uh, security cameras
around here?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.262
Footage from last night

14:24.264 --> 14:26.164
That might back up your story?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.066
Cameras are bad for business.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.501
My customers
aren't breaking any laws.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.503
Doesn't mean they're not
breaking any vows,

14:32.505 --> 14:34.005
If you know what I mean.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.173
(chuckles)

14:35.175 --> 14:36.908
So, we'll just have
a look around?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.076
Absolutely.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.615
But under one condition.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.018
If you see anything
that excites you...

14:48.187 --> 14:49.254
...You let me know?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.555
Yes, ma'am.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.963
He's right there.
Oh.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.937
It's hard to imagine our
victim in this place.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.005
She seemed so innocent.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.373
Well, I guarantee you,

15:08.375 --> 15:10.642
Every one of the girls
that we just met

15:10.644 --> 15:12.443
Has a father at home
who'd tell you the same thing.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.646
(laughter)

15:17.650 --> 15:20.551
Oh, we'll wait on that one.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.686
Okay.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.621
We got, uh,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.123
The schoolroom,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.391
The red room...

15:27.693 --> 15:29.193
...Western room...

15:29.962 --> 15:31.429
...And, uh...

15:32.398 --> 15:33.398
...Jungle room.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.966
Which do you prefer?

15:46.045 --> 15:48.279
(door creaking)

16:08.734 --> 16:10.568
Hey, nick,

16:10.570 --> 16:12.003
Come in here.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.673
So, the victim had

16:15.675 --> 16:16.741
Antique glass in her knee.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.743
Dust void here.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.078
Bottle's missing.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
Mm-hmm.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.593
There's no broken glass
in the trash can.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.135
(glass shattering distantly)

16:47.072 --> 16:50.241
Well, I got some here,
and it's purple.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.513
(sniffs)

17:02.354 --> 17:05.390
Hey, I've got blood.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.094
(indistinct conversations)
man:
Everybody out!

17:10.096 --> 17:11.229
(shutter clicking)

17:11.231 --> 17:13.064
Madam suzanne:
This is ridiculous.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.033
I told you,
this is a legal brothel.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.368
All of my girls are certified
and licensed.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.770
Except for the
16-year-olds, right?

17:18.772 --> 17:21.506
(scoffs) watch your accusations,
detective.

17:21.508 --> 17:25.109
After we're done, you might want
to give one of them a call.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.811
I won't have to wait that long.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.112
Roger, please!

17:28.114 --> 17:29.213
Do something!

17:29.215 --> 17:30.782
This way.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.116
Officer...

17:32.118 --> 17:33.151
No, no, rog, rog,

17:33.153 --> 17:34.385
That's gonna be okay.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.087
Uh, we're not gonna need
your help right now.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.588
I'm roger ridley.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.490
I'm brine county supervisor.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.260
And I know, suzanne can come
off a little rough sometimes,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.629
But I'm here to tell you, this
place is 100% above board.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.698
And is that your
official position, mr. Ridley?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.767
Or are you speaking
as a satisfied customer?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.335
(chuckles)
both.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.338
I mean, I've known suzanne
a long time.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.773
I helped her get this
place licensed.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.408
So I'm just asking
that you set aside

17:57.410 --> 18:00.178
Some of these prejudices
against prostitution.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.345
It's just a business,

18:01.347 --> 18:02.814
Like any other business.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.183
I'm not here because I have
a problem with prostitution.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.517
I'm here
because I have a problem

18:06.519 --> 18:08.286
With 16-year-old girls
being murdered.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.792
Debbie: Look what I made
with the helping homes project.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.595
Not bad, right?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.131
You didn't think I could do it,
but this is, like,

18:20.133 --> 18:24.402
It's a lot of fun being
a helping homes volunteer.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.636
I guess if I flunk
out of school,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.171
I could always become
a construction worker.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.406
(laughs, computer beeps)

18:31.310 --> 18:32.543
What're you doing?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.212
I'm torturing myself.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.446
I'm going through the
victim's computer,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.748
Looking at her e-mails

18:37.750 --> 18:39.450
And her friend agenda page.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.153
I'm just trying to figure out
how does a girl like her

18:42.155 --> 18:44.288
End up in a brothel
and then dead

18:44.290 --> 18:46.257
In a car on the side
of the road?

18:47.426 --> 18:51.129
Everything about her is
so positive and wholesome.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.434
You know, detective crawford is

18:56.436 --> 18:58.236
About to bring
the brothel owner in.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.303
Maybe you want to be there.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.273
Okay.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.677
(door opens)

19:06.679 --> 19:09.780
Mm, brought a woman
with you, huh, detective?

19:09.782 --> 19:11.182
Is that so us gals

19:11.184 --> 19:13.784
Can... Relate?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.720
Oh, I doubt we have much
in common.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.889
Sex business
make you uncomfortable?

19:17.891 --> 19:19.857
No, trafficking in young girls

19:19.859 --> 19:22.160
Does do something bad
to my stomach.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.195
(chuckles)

19:24.197 --> 19:26.397
What kind of person
do you think I am?

19:26.399 --> 19:27.832
Crawford: We have dna
proof that debbie logan

19:27.834 --> 19:32.236
Then she turns up dead,
having been sexually assaulted.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.337
You want us to believe
there's no connection?

19:33.339 --> 19:36.274
I run a legal business.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.742
Yes, you do run a business.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.343
You like to make money, right?

19:40.412 --> 19:41.946
So let's say a client comes in

19:41.948 --> 19:43.748
And offers you
a whole lot of money,

19:43.750 --> 19:45.483
But he likes them young,

19:45.485 --> 19:47.852
And you're someone
who always delivers,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.854
So you deliver debbie logan.

19:50.789 --> 19:51.956
Crawford:
We already have enough

19:51.958 --> 19:54.358
To shut you down.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.893
If you know who killed
that girl,

19:55.895 --> 19:58.229
It's a good time to talk.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.463
Unless you want us to hang

19:59.465 --> 20:01.399
A murder charge
on you as well.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.704
I don't know who killed her.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.541
She was dead the first time
I laid eyes on her.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.477
My bartender, rex,
he found her.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.446
Suzanne,
there's a girl outside.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.315
I think she's dead.
What? Where?

20:17.317 --> 20:20.751
<i>She was outside</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

20:22.521 --> 20:26.290
I don't know anything about her
being inside the brothel.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.458
That is the one and only time

20:27.460 --> 20:29.360
I saw her.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.436
So, um, this is the spot.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.537
She was right here

20:39.539 --> 20:40.538
Next to her car.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.241
Until after I threw
the trash in the dumpster

20:43.243 --> 20:45.243
And was headed back inside.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.578
Why didn't you
call it in, man?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.813
What the hell is
wrong with you?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.648
I went and told madam suzanne.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.984
I thought she'd call it in.
But she didn't.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.553
No, she told me to get rid
of the body, just get it

20:55.555 --> 20:56.921
Anywhere away from here.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.890
So that's what I did.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.959
<i>I found her keys in her purse</i>

21:01.961 --> 21:03.594
<i>And I put her in the car.</i>

21:03.596 --> 21:05.963
<i>I did what I could</i>
<i>to cover up the blood,</i>

21:05.965 --> 21:07.898
<i>So no one would know,</i>

21:07.900 --> 21:10.434
<i>And then I got her</i>
<i>the hell out of here,</i>

21:10.436 --> 21:12.903
<i>Away from the brothel.</i>

21:12.905 --> 21:15.673
I drove her up the highway,
parked the car

21:15.675 --> 21:17.508
And... And hitched back.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.283
You're an idiot.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.284
You know that?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.618
Come on, I...

21:27.620 --> 21:29.487
I didn't try to hide her.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.356
I... I put her where I knew
she'd be found.

21:34.559 --> 21:37.461
(sirens wailing)

21:53.545 --> 21:55.646
Hodges:
Blood, yours.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.415
Cigarette butt, mine.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.852
Oh.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.855
A 1926 penny.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.624
That's got to be
worth something by now.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.092
I'm sure it's
probably doubled

22:08.094 --> 22:10.061
Or even tripled in value
since then.

22:11.596 --> 22:14.899
Hey, you know, there's a rumor
going around the office

22:14.901 --> 22:16.701
That you visited a brothel once.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.436
Is that true?

22:18.438 --> 22:19.704
Many, many years ago.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.840
It's a long story,
and not one with a happy ending.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.476
No pun intended.

22:26.611 --> 22:27.945
Aha.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.381
I will see your two
cigarette butts,

22:30.383 --> 22:32.383
Rusty pull tab
and penny,

22:32.385 --> 22:35.119
And raise you one
piece of turquoise.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.723
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.459
So I talked to the girls.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.827
Several of them said
that the bartender

22:42.829 --> 22:44.428
Was only outside for a minute--

22:44.430 --> 22:48.666
Then he came running back in,
looking for madam suzanne.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.968
So if we believe the girls,
rex isn't the killer.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.473
Well, we still need to
find the murder weapon.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.915
Stokes:
Hey, check this out.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.119
Shoe impression.

23:08.121 --> 23:09.653
Looks fairly fresh.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.156
Pointed, like the toe
of a boot.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.792
Or a high-heel.
Plenty of those in there.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.562
Ah.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.899
Or...

23:21.901 --> 23:25.403
The killer left it behind when
they were getting rid of this.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.405
Consistent with the
victim's head wound.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.809
♪

23:51.530 --> 23:54.165
Only thing harder than
getting blood from a stone

23:54.167 --> 23:55.866
Is getting fingerprints.

23:55.868 --> 23:56.967
Nothing there?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.068
Nothing usable.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.170
Too smudged.

23:59.172 --> 24:02.139
Killer probably was
wearing gloves.

24:02.141 --> 24:05.476
You still running the prints
from the brothel?

24:05.478 --> 24:08.212
Yep. I already processed
about a hundred lifts.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.848
Probably have at least
that many still to go.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.917
Brothel turns out to be
quite the popular place.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.218
What a surprise.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.753
Interesting clientele, too.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.855
I've already had
two city councilmen,

24:17.857 --> 24:19.123
A former child actor

24:19.125 --> 24:21.492
And an over-the-hill
rock star.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.661
(computer beeping)

24:23.663 --> 24:26.230
That's interesting. One of
the prints from the brothel,

24:26.232 --> 24:28.566
The western room-- it's a match

24:28.568 --> 24:30.234
To one of the exemplar
prints we collected

24:30.236 --> 24:32.036
Before processing
the victim's car.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.204
You got a name?

24:33.206 --> 24:35.473
Let's see.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.212
That's the girl's father.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.880
His prints are all over
the brothel.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.048
He was there.

24:48.019 --> 24:49.620
Russell: It's almost
a cliché at this point--

24:49.622 --> 24:53.257
A revered man of the cloth
indulging in carnal escapades.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.226
I checked with
your secretary, mr. Logan.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.694
You clear your schedule

24:56.696 --> 24:58.662
For "personal reasons"
every Tuesday night.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.865
Right about the same time,
your bank records show

25:00.867 --> 25:04.034
You withdrawing $500 cash--
week in and week out.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.903
Kind of brothel regular,
aren't you?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.771
There's nothing illegal
about my going there.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.607
A bit hypocritical though,
don't you think?

25:09.609 --> 25:11.509
What happens there
is between me and god.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.946
You're missing the point,
mr. Logan.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.215
We don't really care what
goes on between you and god.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.950
Or you and
your favorite hooker,

25:19.952 --> 25:22.019
For that matter.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.855
Our problem is: You frequent
the very same brothel

25:24.857 --> 25:26.023
Where your daughter was killed

25:26.025 --> 25:27.725
Two nights ago.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.193
That's our problem.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.729
Wait a minute.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.897
Debbie was at the brothel?

25:32.899 --> 25:35.232
Crawford:
Don't act surprised.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.233
We don't buy it.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.568
You can't think I had

25:37.570 --> 25:38.802
Something to do with
debbie's death?

25:38.804 --> 25:40.037
No, I'll tell you what I think.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.274
What your Tuesday nights
are all about.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.544
<i>She caught you in the act.</i>

25:46.546 --> 25:47.811
Daddy, how could you?

25:47.813 --> 25:49.547
We have to talk.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.049
You are a hypocrite!
Listen to me!

25:52.051 --> 25:55.019
This has to only
be our secret!

25:55.021 --> 25:56.120
No, no, listen to me!

25:56.122 --> 25:58.689
(grunts)

25:58.691 --> 26:00.624
Fight started
in the western room.

26:00.626 --> 26:01.859
That's where debbie
cut her knee.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.894
At some point,
she ran outside.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.962
I'm guessing
you followed her out there

26:04.964 --> 26:06.664
'cause you knew
you had to stop her.

26:08.099 --> 26:11.068
Debbie, if you tell,
I'll lose the church.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.338
And your mother-- you really
want to hurt her like that?!

26:14.340 --> 26:16.273
Don't even talk to me!
You should've thought of that.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.075
Don't you walk away from me!

26:22.013 --> 26:25.082
I don't know what
sick twisted world you live in.

26:26.685 --> 26:30.254
But I could never, ever,
lay a hand on my daughter.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.024
You don't have to take
my word for it.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.960
I wasn't at the brothel
Tuesday night.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.028
There was an emergency.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.363
One of my parishioners died,

26:39.365 --> 26:41.599
And I was ministering
to that family

26:41.601 --> 26:42.933
All night.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.268
This is their number.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.337
You call and check
if you don't believe me.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.980
Okay, so we're only testing
shoes and boots

26:55.982 --> 26:57.648
With pointed toes.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.985
Okay, so sneakers, anything with
a round toe, we don't need.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.653
This is such
a waste of time.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.856
Can't prince charming here
just test the shoes on his own?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.191
Why do we have to be here?

27:07.193 --> 27:08.392
Because the impression
will be different

27:08.394 --> 27:09.793
With the weight of your foot

27:09.795 --> 27:12.162
Inside of the shoe
pressing down.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.231
Okay.

27:19.170 --> 27:22.006
Actually, I only need
the right one.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.044
You can have a seat.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.385
Okay, stand up.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.021
Try to stand still.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.722
All right, now lift up.

27:38.724 --> 27:42.026
Great. Take your shoes off
and just leave them right there.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.382
Hey, finn.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.151
Yeah?

28:07.153 --> 28:09.086
Take a look at this.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.155
There's glass
stuck in the sole.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.991
That looks a lot like the glass
we found in the victim's knee.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.226
You know, when I interviewed
the girls earlier,

28:16.228 --> 28:17.761
Kirsten said that she had never

28:17.763 --> 28:20.197
Been in the
western room.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.168
<i>You lied to me.</i>

28:24.170 --> 28:27.271
You told me that you had never
been in the western room.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.306
That's not true, is it?

28:29.308 --> 28:31.075
Wow, a hooker
who can't be trusted.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.443
Shocking, right?

28:32.445 --> 28:34.178
I don't think this is
something to joke about.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.312
Who's joking?

28:35.314 --> 28:38.015
I know about
your two drug busts.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.851
It'd be really easy for me
to make a call right now

28:40.853 --> 28:42.486
And have your
prostitution license revoked.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.188
Unless you have
some other job skills

28:44.190 --> 28:45.155
That I don't know about...

28:45.157 --> 28:46.290
Fine, all right?

28:46.292 --> 28:48.358
I saw her.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.228
She showed up at the back
door, and I let her in.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.463
I put her in
the western room

28:52.465 --> 28:54.131
So that madam suzanne
wouldn't see her.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.366
She'd blow a boob if she
saw a kid in this place.

28:56.368 --> 28:57.835
Why was she here?

28:57.837 --> 28:59.236
I don't know.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.004
We get girls like her sometimes.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.440
Runaways usually.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.242
They think the glamorous
life of prostitution

29:05.244 --> 29:06.777
Is gonna be the answer.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.278
Well, she wasn't a runaway.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.147
Whatever.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.449
Told her she didn't
belong here.

29:12.451 --> 29:16.086
And when she broke that bottle,
I showed her to the door.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.822
That was the last
time I saw her.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.524
Wow, that's the lamest lie
I've ever heard.

29:22.827 --> 29:26.230
Do you know that girl
was only 16 years old?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.868
Someone raped
and assaulted her,

29:30.870 --> 29:34.838
And then beat her
over the head with a rock.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.840
So, I don't know
what your life was like

29:36.842 --> 29:38.242
Or what was done to you,

29:38.244 --> 29:40.410
But nobody deserves
to have that happen to them.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.312
(door opens)

29:42.314 --> 29:44.148
Logan:
Kirsten!

29:44.150 --> 29:46.116
Don't say another word.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.251
Finlay:
What are you doing here?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.285
I called an attorney.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.387
She doesn't have to talk to you.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.362
I guess we're done here.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.533
Kirsten.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.404
Saved her from
a confession.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.173
Not even a "thank you."

30:09.175 --> 30:10.808
You ever wonder

30:10.810 --> 30:14.478
I mean, are you gonna pay
for her attorney, too?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.246
If I have to.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.447
Why would you do that?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.850
Well, because
he's in love with her.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.386
She's miss Tuesday night,
isn't she?

30:24.889 --> 30:26.957
She's my daughter.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.062
But we thought that debbie was
an only child.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.331
No. She had a sister.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.200
Kirsten was 17
when she ran away.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.434
We've been estranged ever since.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.604
So you coming here
every Tuesday night...

30:40.606 --> 30:42.606
It's the only chance
I get to talk to her.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.242
I have to pay for her time,
just like anyone else.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.144
At $500 a week?

30:47.146 --> 30:49.279
$500 is nothing
for the chance

30:49.281 --> 30:52.482
To sit down and talk
to my daughter.

30:52.484 --> 30:56.119
I have never
given up on her.

30:56.121 --> 30:58.155
And I'm never gonna
give up on her.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.324
Mr. Logan,

31:00.326 --> 31:03.994
We have reason to believe
that kirsten may have been

31:03.996 --> 31:05.229
Involved with debbie's murder.

31:05.231 --> 31:08.232
Then you better
get the evidence.

31:08.234 --> 31:12.202
'cause I'm gonna make sure she
has the best defense available.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.441
So our preacher
has two daughters, right?

31:17.443 --> 31:19.276
One a hooker, the other,

31:19.278 --> 31:21.345
As far as we can tell,
practically an angel.

31:21.347 --> 31:24.882
So let's say that
kirsten is our killer.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.483
What's her motive?

31:26.485 --> 31:27.551
Jealously, right?

31:27.553 --> 31:28.552
Yeah.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.288
Kirsten's stuck being a hooker,

31:31.290 --> 31:33.657
Paying the bills on her back,
while her little sister is

31:33.659 --> 31:35.959
At home being treated
like a princess.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.895
Mom has written her off
completely.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.429
Dad still pays a weekly visit,

31:39.431 --> 31:41.398
But he probably just
preaches at her,

31:41.400 --> 31:44.534
Tells her she should be more
like her little sister, right?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.503
Yeah, that could make her snap.
Right.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.372
Cracks a rock
over debbie's head.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.942
Well, I've been
working on an I.D.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.111
For the guy who sexually
assaulted our victim.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.179
I don't have a name yet,
but I was processing

31:56.181 --> 31:58.982
Dna samples brought in from the
brothel, and I found a match.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.018
Specifically, to
dna on bedsheets

32:01.020 --> 32:02.352
That came from the asian room.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.355
So the last customer
in the asian room...

32:05.357 --> 32:06.957
Same person
who raped debbie logan.

32:12.497 --> 32:15.365
So I met this bozo
at the brothel;

32:15.367 --> 32:17.067
He's a friend of the madam's.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.368
(people chattering urgently)

32:18.370 --> 32:20.070
Man: Close the door!
Close the door!

32:20.072 --> 32:22.539
Run! Call the cops!

32:22.541 --> 32:23.573
Woman:
Help!

32:23.575 --> 32:25.575
Somebody call 911!
He's got a gun!

32:25.577 --> 32:26.610
Who's got a gun? Ridley?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.211
No, no. The reverend.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.313
He's gonna kill him!

32:29.315 --> 32:30.314
Man: Move! Let's go!
Everybody clear out!

32:30.316 --> 32:31.315
Hurry up!
Come on, you guys!

32:31.317 --> 32:32.482
Logan:
Bastard.

32:32.484 --> 32:33.617
How could you do that

32:33.619 --> 32:35.285
To a little girl?

32:36.421 --> 32:38.422
To my baby?!

32:38.424 --> 32:39.990
Mr. Logan, drop the gun.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.525
He has to die.

32:44.162 --> 32:47.564
I have to kill him for
what he did to debbie!

32:55.573 --> 32:58.275
Come on, now, jim.
You can't do this.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.211
He raped and killed
my little girl.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.580
For god's sake,
I did nothing of the sort.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.648
Stop lying!

33:04.650 --> 33:06.216
Look, there's the proof.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.417
She fought for her life.
Stokes: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:07.419 --> 33:11.121
Now, you know this is wrong.
How is this wrong?

33:11.123 --> 33:13.256
He deserves it!
Crawford:
No doubt he does,

33:13.258 --> 33:14.391
But let us deal with it, okay?

33:14.393 --> 33:16.159
Not you.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.194
No...
(cocks gun)

33:17.196 --> 33:18.996
I have to do this.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.597
Hey! Hey! Listen...

33:21.733 --> 33:23.667
Now, I can't quote
any scripture...

33:23.669 --> 33:26.636
Yeah, I don't have any
godly words for you...

33:26.638 --> 33:30.474
But I do know this:
If you shoot him,

33:30.476 --> 33:32.175
Detective crawford,
right behind you,

33:32.177 --> 33:35.245
Is gonna pop you right
in the back of the head.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.413
Man, nobody wants that.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.383
So how about...

33:43.021 --> 33:45.789
...I reach up and I take
that gun from you...

33:47.225 --> 33:48.225
(shudders)

33:49.627 --> 33:52.062
All right?

33:56.067 --> 33:57.300
Nice and easy.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.708
Good man.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.246
For god's sake,
you should've shot him.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.548
Shut up, fool.
Come on.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.418
(siren approaching)

34:14.420 --> 34:15.819
Don't you even move.

34:17.288 --> 34:19.556
He did those things I said.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.091
He's the one responsible.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.092
We know.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.326
But how'd you find out?

34:23.328 --> 34:26.163
Debbie explained everything
to her the other night.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.098
Is that why debbie
went to the brothel?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.366
She was looking
for her sister?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.301
No, no, no,
she was there to see me.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.769
She thought I was there
with kirsten.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.805
She was upset and
she wanted to...

34:34.807 --> 34:38.241
Tell me what that piece of crap
had done-- how he raped her.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.411
Officer: Excuse me.
Out of the way, please.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.280
You can put those away.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.448
We're all code four here.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.650
It's okay, jim.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.619
And walk him out
to the car for me.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.521
But sit on him for
a few minutes, okay?

34:51.523 --> 34:53.390
He's gonna be riding
back with me.

34:56.794 --> 34:58.795
Boy, I hope you guys
are smart enough

34:58.797 --> 35:00.530
To realize he's delusional.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.599
It must be, uh,
just the grief or something.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.268
I tell you what: We'll take
a look at the evidence.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.403
We'll draw our own conclusions.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.438
Eh, that's the ladies
at the brothel--

35:08.440 --> 35:09.439
They don't hold back.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.475
Yeah.
You know what I mean.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.676
Sure.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.510
Open up.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.744
Pardon me?

35:14.746 --> 35:19.649
(scoffs)
crawford: You know what this
is gonna reveal, right?

35:19.651 --> 35:21.718
That you raped
a 16 year old.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.153
Rape?!

35:23.155 --> 35:24.554
There wasn't any rape!

35:24.556 --> 35:26.590
If anything happened,
it was consensual.

35:26.592 --> 35:29.559
And, for the record,
I thought she was 18.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.129
You knew she wasn't.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.597
That's why you killed her;
to keep her quiet.

35:33.599 --> 35:36.266
Come on!
You guys are way off base here.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.734
For starters,
let's not paint this girl

35:37.736 --> 35:39.169
Like some kind of angel.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.437
She wasn't no virgin.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.771
You know that's a lie.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.140
She got paid for it.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.508
If you don't believe me,

35:44.510 --> 35:46.343
Why don't you go ask
the woman who pimped her out?

35:46.345 --> 35:47.677
Crawford:
What are you talking about?

35:47.679 --> 35:48.879
This madam suzanne?

35:48.881 --> 35:50.280
Not suzanne; I told you--

35:50.282 --> 35:52.249
Suzanne's on the up and up.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.417
Okay, then who the hell
are you talking about?

35:58.589 --> 36:01.458
Can somebody please tell me
what I am doing here?

36:01.460 --> 36:04.261
I'm supposed to be at
a memorial service for
my daughter right now.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.463
This is... Unconscionable.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.266
Mrs. Logan,
we've been talking with a...

36:09.268 --> 36:10.734
An acquaintance of yours--

36:10.736 --> 36:13.503
Brime county supervisor
roger ridley.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.772
He's downstairs in a holding
cell, as a matter of fact.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.674
Finlay: He signed
a sworn statement

36:17.676 --> 36:21.478
Saying that he paid you
$1,200 and, in return,

36:21.480 --> 36:24.848
You arranged for him to have sex
with your daughter debbie.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.384
That's disgusting.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.886
That is a horrible
thing to say!

36:29.888 --> 36:31.488
Why do you think
he said it, then?

36:31.490 --> 36:33.423
I have no idea.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.959
I... I-I don't know.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.461
I... My husband and I were
pretty vocal

36:38.463 --> 36:41.431
Opposing mr. Ridley's
election last year.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.966
I-I-I can only think
that he's trying

36:42.968 --> 36:44.534
To get back at us somehow?

36:47.972 --> 36:50.440
I mean, you're not gonna
take the word of a...

36:50.442 --> 36:52.475
Of a dirty, horny
pedophile over...

36:53.511 --> 36:55.912
...Mine, a preacher's wife.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.348
Well, you weren't always a
preacher's wife, were you?

36:58.350 --> 37:01.551
These are lvpd
arrest reports,

37:01.553 --> 37:05.655
One from 1989
and two from 1990.

37:05.657 --> 37:09.226
Solicitation
for prostitution.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.365
Okay.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.600
So what?

37:17.802 --> 37:18.935
I was a prostitute.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.704
It was a long time ago.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.638
Russell:
You were young.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.241
You were really young.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.909
But then your husband came along

37:25.911 --> 37:28.011
And rescued you.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.246
(mocking laughter)

37:29.248 --> 37:30.880
"rescued me."

37:30.882 --> 37:33.483
That's funny, actually.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.851
You ever know
one of those people--

37:34.853 --> 37:36.953
Someone who rescues
lots of animals?

37:36.955 --> 37:39.322
Then you see them with their
pets, later, and you realize

37:39.324 --> 37:40.857
They don't give a damn
about the animals.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.392
They just want the whole world

37:42.394 --> 37:43.593
To think
they're someone special.

37:45.796 --> 37:47.697
That's jim.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.533
All his charity,
all of his missionary work,

37:50.535 --> 37:54.471
The hours and hours he spends
helping out his parishioners...

37:54.473 --> 37:55.772
So you don't think
that was genuine.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.741
He just wants everyone
to think he's a great guy.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.442
Gets off on
the pats on his back.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.610
Well, he obviously
helped you

38:00.612 --> 38:02.345
Turn your life around.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.516
You sound just like
all the rest of them.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.886
I should be so lucky
to have him.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.555
My life before jim
was just fine.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.524
Being a prostitute,
you mean.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.661
Good enough for you, good enough
for your daughters, right?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.663
Finlay:
How old was kirsten

38:19.665 --> 38:21.564
When you first started
pimping her out?

38:21.566 --> 38:22.932
Fifteen?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.301
Yeah, how old was she?

38:24.303 --> 38:27.437
When I was 15, I was working.

38:27.439 --> 38:31.441
Mm-hmm. I guess kirsten was
too scared to run to her dad.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.575
Kept her mouth shut.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.511
Too bad debbie
couldn't do the same.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.480
After she was raped by
supervisor ridley,

38:37.482 --> 38:40.917
She ran to the brothel to tell
her father what had happened,

38:40.919 --> 38:43.887
And tell him what
you had been doing.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.455
Russell: Yeah, lucky for you,
he wasn't there.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.523
But you were.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.957
<i>You were waiting outside...</i>

38:47.959 --> 38:48.992
Mom...?
Oh, you bitch!

38:48.994 --> 38:50.493
You think you're
better than kirsten!

38:50.495 --> 38:52.562
You think you're
better than me!

38:57.668 --> 38:59.436
This is all a lie.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.004
You can't prove
any of this.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.908
We have a pair of shoes
that we found in the trash

39:04.910 --> 39:07.477
Behind your house,
with blood on them,

39:07.479 --> 39:08.912
And I am sure that,
when we test them,

39:08.914 --> 39:10.947
They are going to match
the shoe impression

39:10.949 --> 39:12.782
That you left
at the murder scene.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.784
Russell: Also found
a turquoise stone,

39:14.786 --> 39:16.786
In the gravel,
outside the brothel.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.955
Matches perfectly to a bracelet

39:18.957 --> 39:21.124
That you had in your
dresser drawer, so...

39:21.126 --> 39:24.861
Yeah, yeah,
we can prove this, mrs. Logan.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.938
They're not my girls;
you know that.

39:37.975 --> 39:39.542
They were adopted.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.845
Jim's idea.

39:41.847 --> 39:42.879
Two more rescues.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.447
I never wanted 'em.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.659
Mr. Logan...

39:56.661 --> 39:59.028
Your wife will
remain in custody.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.497
She's gonna be
charged with murder.

40:00.499 --> 40:01.631
I'm sorry.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.099
So it's true?

40:03.101 --> 40:05.769
She killed debbie?

40:05.771 --> 40:06.970
Yes, sir.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.938
And then...

40:08.940 --> 40:10.039
What ridley said, too?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.574
She was selling the girls?

40:13.544 --> 40:16.846
Kirsten, for years,
until she ran away, yeah.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.082
And she was just
starting with debbie.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.585
All this time, kirsten...
Never told me.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.987
Or maybe she tried
and I didn't see it.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.723
I don't know how
I could've been so blind.

40:27.792 --> 40:29.793
It's, you know, it's...

40:29.795 --> 40:31.161
Been overwhelming.

40:31.163 --> 40:35.932
All these people in my parish
are in need and-and...

40:37.902 --> 40:41.171
...And I neglected the ones
who needed me the most.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.140
And now I've lost them.

40:48.179 --> 40:51.581
Well... Maybe not all of them.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.851
You could still
save your daughter.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.701
I think she'll
be saving me.
