WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:03.635
So, nolan, we haven't talked
about how you're doing.

00:03.637 --> 00:06.638
You seem a little bit
out of it today, even for you.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.640
I don't know what's wrong
with me lately.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.643
I've been spacey
and forgetful

00:11.645 --> 00:14.279
And I've been
snacking a lot.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.583
Have you been doing
a little bit of this?

00:17.585 --> 00:19.752
Making turkey
shadow puppets?

00:20.754 --> 00:23.722
Sometimes.
Mostly when I'm high.

00:25.558 --> 00:29.294
That is the first
and last time I am
ever taking the bus.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.063
I told the driver
I was in a hurry,

00:31.065 --> 00:34.199
But he stopped
for, like, every person
who wanted a ride.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.236
That is the problem
with public transportation.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.272
Why are you
taking the bus?

00:40.274 --> 00:42.574
'cause she's a foreigner.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.643
That's where
all non-americans

00:44.645 --> 00:47.346
Go to plot against
the rest of us.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.682
Hey, just because I'm not fat
doesn't mean I'm not american.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.519
I'm proud of my curves.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.687
Lace, we only have
a few minutes left,

00:55.689 --> 00:57.623
So why don't you sit down
and tell us what happened?

00:57.625 --> 01:00.659
Last night the stupid police
took my license away

01:00.661 --> 01:02.594
For a month
for no reason at all.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.431
I mean, the jerk I was chasing
was driving, like, 100

01:05.433 --> 01:07.566
And I was only going 60,

01:07.568 --> 01:10.402
Which I know is still
a lot for a sidewalk.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.272
- Who were you chasing?
- This guy I've been seeing.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.741
He invited me to this club,
then ditched me at the bar

01:15.743 --> 01:18.510
And took off
with some skank.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.346
Why?
He had a perfectly good one
right in front of him.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.715
Thank you.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.584
Lacey, you're on probation.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.619
Was the risk of a car chase
really worth it?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.756
And if you'd caught
the guy, what sort of
enlightened exchange

01:30.758 --> 01:34.626
Were you expecting
to have with the gentleman
and his skank?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.628
Okay, we're out of time.
I'll see you all next Tuesday.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.468
Hey, lacey, can I have
a word with you
before you go?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.636
A little outside
of what we deal with here,

01:44.638 --> 01:47.840
But I'm concerned about
your choices in men.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.575
I know, I know.

01:49.577 --> 01:53.679
But it's so hard to find
a hot guy with a slow car.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.715
No, no.
I'm talking about your
self-destructive pattern

01:56.717 --> 01:58.750
Of choosing men
who mistreat you.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.352
Don't you think
you deserve a better guy?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.554
Come on,
that's just how guys are.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.591
That's not true.
There's a lot of guys
out there

02:05.593 --> 02:08.260
Who would take you
dancing and never even
look at another woman.

02:08.262 --> 02:12.131
I know,
but turning gay guys
is so much work.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.667
I'm talking about
straight guys who would
do anything for you.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.571
Sure, they do.
You sit next to one
in group.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.240
You think I should
go out with nolan?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.875
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.644
I'm just saying
that there's 1,000
nice guys out there

02:25.646 --> 02:27.146
Who would do
anything for you.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.615
Oh, my god.
Are you hitting on me?

02:29.617 --> 02:31.416
What? No.

02:31.418 --> 02:34.620
No. Just keep
your eyes open when
you're at the supermarket

02:34.622 --> 02:37.789
Or the laundromat
or the library.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.925
You've never been to any
of those places, have you?

02:42.595 --> 02:44.663
( panting )

02:44.665 --> 02:47.799
Next time,
only one of us
wears the blindfold.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.304
That was just a lot
of gropin' and hopin'.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.441
All right, good night.

02:57.777 --> 03:00.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.614
I'm going to sleep.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.750
No, no, no, no, no.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.818
We don't do sleep.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.188
When we're done,
we just high-five

03:09.190 --> 03:10.756
And go our separate ways.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.859
The guys in porn cuddle
more than you do.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.828
I told you how I feel
about sleeping over.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.630
The next thing you know,
we'll be happily married

03:18.632 --> 03:20.766
And completely miserable.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.868
You can't send me home.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

03:24.604 --> 03:28.840
Okay, look, if you want
to stay for a bit,
we can talk.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.776
I'd rather sleep.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.711
Drive safe.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.913
Okay. Okay, fine.
I'll talk.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.417
Let me ask you something.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.985
Where would you go
to meet nice guys?

03:41.287 --> 03:44.723
Boy, you really are
desperate to cuddle.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.826
No, it's lacey.
She's attracted to
these toxic men

03:47.828 --> 03:49.861
And I just thought
it'd be good for her

03:49.863 --> 03:51.563
To meet somebody nice.
Any ideas?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.366
Well, you have to get her
out of the clubs and bars.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.301
There's museums,
there's charities.

03:56.303 --> 03:59.004
I met a really nice guy
at my improv comedy class.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.873
I'm sorry,
your what now?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.009
Improvisational
comedy class.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.645
I read a study that
suggests that therapists

04:06.647 --> 04:08.247
Who incorporate humor
into their practice

04:08.249 --> 04:11.583
Have a 32% higher
success rate.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.986
I, for one, want to laugh
my way to success.

04:13.988 --> 04:17.889
That's actually the name
of the class, too.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.658
How's that working
out for you?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.761
Ahem.
Give me a location,

04:22.763 --> 04:25.297
A food, and a famous
historical figure.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.899
No, that's fine.
You don't have to
prove anything.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.335
Why, mr. Lincoln,

04:30.337 --> 04:33.405
What are you doing
at the taj mahal

04:33.407 --> 04:35.941
Drinking
a root beer float?

04:38.778 --> 04:40.612
Yeah, I'm gonna
go home now.

04:41.881 --> 04:45.851
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:45.853 --> 04:48.320
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
<i>- coming.</i>

04:51.691 --> 04:53.992
Hi, lacey.
Bus was early today?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.428
I got a ride with nolan.
He's always sitting outside

04:56.430 --> 04:58.597
In his car
with binoculars anyway.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.832
Well, stick around
after group.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.702
I have some suggestions
on where you can meet
a better class of guys.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.838
Hey, lacey, you left
your latte in the car.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.541
Is it the correct
drinking temperature yet?

05:11.077 --> 05:12.844
Ah!

05:12.846 --> 05:15.480
Couple more minutes.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.349
I'll get some ice for you.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.418
Thank you.
That'll cool the coffee
down faster.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.989
( water running )

05:25.558 --> 05:27.893
- Hi, sam.
- Hey.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.695
You're really
scrubbing there.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.530
You okay or is it
an ocd thing?

05:31.532 --> 05:34.933
No, I dropped my phone
in the toilet and I had
to reach in and get it.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.802
You reached into a toilet?

05:36.804 --> 05:39.805
Wow, that's got to be
a big step for you.

05:39.807 --> 05:43.542
I'm proud and disgusted
at the same time.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.744
I had to answer it.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.879
I guess my compulsion
of answering a ringing phone

05:47.881 --> 05:50.349
Is stronger than
my obsession with germs.

05:50.351 --> 05:53.685
Well, we all have
our priorities.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.863
Okay, everybody,
let's get started.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.898
I don't usually
begin with a theme,

06:06.900 --> 06:10.068
But today I'd like
to discuss secrets.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.771
Because there is nothing
more unhealthy

06:12.773 --> 06:14.473
Than keeping them
to ourselves.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.743
Anybody have something
they would like to reveal?

06:17.745 --> 06:18.877
I would.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.446
I don't trust
black weathermen.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.649
Good example.
Anyone else?

06:24.651 --> 06:27.085
Or jewish sportscasters.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.821
Of course,
that goes without saying.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.625
I mean, does anyone else
want to share a secret?

06:34.660 --> 06:37.896
Okay.
This is very delicate,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.866
But I was spending one summer
with my aunt and uncle

06:40.868 --> 06:44.469
And I found out that they
were both the same person.

06:45.505 --> 06:46.905
Fascinating.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.475
How about you, nolan?
Lacey?

06:50.477 --> 06:52.411
( whispers )
can I tell them
we're going out?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.413
Oh, my god!
You're going out?

06:54.415 --> 06:55.914
( whispers )
can I tell them now?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.750
It seems like
they already know.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.485
Fine, we're going out.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.821
Finally, a secret
worth exploring.

07:02.823 --> 07:07.459
You said something
the other day about me
needing a nice guy.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.729
And normally when
you talk, I just hear,
"blah, blah, blah, blah."

07:10.731 --> 07:14.166
But this time I heard,
"blah, blah, blah, blah,
nolan, blah, blah."

07:14.168 --> 07:17.135
And it really moved me.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.837
So I thought
I'd give it a shot.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.973
Okay. Okay.
Well, as a therapist,

07:21.975 --> 07:23.842
It's not my place
to judge the choices
that you make.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.877
<i>So, everybody else,</i>

07:25.879 --> 07:28.914
Feel free to judge
the choices they make.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.983
- I think it's great.
- Of course you do.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.554
If it makes them happy
to be together,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.122
Maybe they won't have
to come here anymore,

07:37.124 --> 07:40.592
And that'll make me
happy and I won't have
to come here anymore.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.893
And with the three
of them gone,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.129
I can finally finish my story
about my aunt bruce.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.864
Unbelievable.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.133
You people
criticize the muffins
I put out every week,

07:48.135 --> 07:49.901
But nobody has any issues
with this?

07:49.903 --> 07:53.104
Well, it's just
that if you put out
a chocolate chip muffin,

07:53.106 --> 07:56.942
The chips should
be evenly distributed
throughout the muffin.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.680
People dating
within a therapy group
is a terrible idea.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.516
It can only lead to dishonesty
and manipulation.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.152
Look, I know it seems
weird, but I deserve
someone like nolan.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.021
I mean, yeah, he's not
the sort of guy I've gone
out with in the past,

08:10.023 --> 08:12.123
But I believe
I can change.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.160
Yeah, and I'm sure
that I can change, too.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.697
I used to only be into
super controlling girls,
but now--

08:18.699 --> 08:21.066
Hey, what did I say
about talking too much?

08:21.068 --> 08:23.702
Nolan, you don't have
to listen to her.
You can talk.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.176
I don't know
about this, charlie.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.912
I feel a little creepy
installing a tracking program

08:33.914 --> 08:35.647
On our daughter's phone.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.649
Look, if we're replacing
her phone, we might as well.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.185
It's like when they tag
a giraffe so they can see
where it migrates,

08:40.187 --> 08:42.053
What it eats,
and most importantly,

08:42.055 --> 08:44.256
To make sure
it doesn't mate.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.991
But this is just
for her safety, right?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.993
I mean, she's a good kid.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.095
We're not trying to catch
her doing something bad.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.030
No, we're not trying to,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.999
But we'll be able to.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.268
Without even leaving
the house.

08:56.270 --> 08:59.170
I feel like the jetsons.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.973
Test it. Telephone,
where are you now?

09:01.975 --> 09:06.611
According to this,
we're at a chipotle
in albuquerque.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.748
Oh, I love the one here.
I wonder if that one's good.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.118
I think I entered
the wrong number.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.290
Look, I know you're worried
about lacey and nolan dating,
but you don't have to be.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.958
I'm the one
who gave her the idea.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
No, I mean, it's not
going to last.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.129
Women like lacey
don't go out with guys

09:24.131 --> 09:26.298
Because their anger shrink
tells them to.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.868
The only reason she'd be with
nolan is so she could use him.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.137
Use him for what?
Tap water?

09:32.139 --> 09:35.907
I dated a guy for three months
'cause he had air conditioning.

09:36.842 --> 09:37.943
That's terrible.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.879
Charlie, it was really hot.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.914
Old people were dying.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.051
Yeah, well,
if lacey's using him,

09:46.053 --> 09:47.852
Then nolan's gonna
be destroyed.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.056
He's convinced he's found
the abusive girl of his dreams.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.124
I mean, it's not like
I wasn't putting out.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.695
I've got to talk to her.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.830
I don't know
who we're tracking,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.933
But right now
they're at the dave
& busters in new orleans.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.069
These people
know how to live.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.204
It's not even
the weekend.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.643
Hey, lace.
Thanks for coming by early.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.111
Am I in trouble?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.246
'cause if I am,
I would have worn
something tighter.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.016
Impossible.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.919
No, I just wanted to see
how things are going with
you and nolan.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.254
Oh, good.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.257
Like, I mean, I complete him
or he completes me or whatever.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.762
Lacey, I'm gonna ask
you something and I need
you to tell me the truth.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.063
Are you using nolan?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.799
What? No.
Oh, my god,
I would never.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.768
I'm so insulted,
I don't know what to do.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.071
Lacey, our entire
relationship

10:40.073 --> 10:42.040
Is predicated on you
being honest with me.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.743
So I'm gonna ask you again,
are you using nolan?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.711
Can we talk
patient to therapist?

10:46.713 --> 10:50.348
Of course.
I'll be the therapist.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.351
When I lost my license,
I couldn't go anywhere.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.787
I couldn't get my hair done,
my nails done.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.657
My brazilian was starting
to be reclaimed by the jungle.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.725
Okay, okay.

11:00.727 --> 11:04.195
So you're acting like
his girlfriend so he'll
drive you around?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.764
Hey, it's a good deal
for him, too.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.166
He gets what
he always wanted--
to be near me.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.968
Lacey, you can't
do this to him.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.270
Sure, I can.
He's not very bright.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.141
The minute you
get your license back,
you're gonna dump him.

11:16.143 --> 11:20.378
Before we break up,
I'll let him touch the sides.

11:21.881 --> 11:25.150
Lacey, this is degrading
to you, degrading to nolan,

11:25.152 --> 11:28.053
And not to mention
you're completely rewriting
the rules of second base.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.356
I will not let you abuse
nolan like this.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.258
Yes, you will because
of a little something

11:33.260 --> 11:36.227
Called patient-therapist
confidentiality.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.399
Here's your pressed beet
green apple wheatgrass

11:41.401 --> 11:45.203
Ginger juice with a soy
protein power boost.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.138
A boost?
I didn't ask for a boost.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.907
I know, but I thought
you'd like it.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.276
You know what I like?
I like what I asked for.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.212
From now on, make sure
that's what I get.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.250
Nolan, you think
you deserve to be
treated like this?

11:59.252 --> 12:02.353
Not yet, but I think
I can earn it eventually.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.057
So I turned to the table
next to me,

12:06.059 --> 12:11.229
"if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna come over there
and I'm gonna shut you up."

12:11.231 --> 12:13.431
I know you're trying to be
more direct with your anger,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.834
But there's no reason
to threaten a baby.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.136
Oh, fine,
take that jerk's side.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.772
Everybody else did.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.874
Do you want another
diet coke, chipmunk?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.843
No, I'm at max bloat.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.277
Chipmunk.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.380
I take back everything
I said before.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.784
<i>These two together</i>
<i>are the most disgusting</i>
<i>thing I've ever seen.</i>

12:32.786 --> 12:36.221
And I delivered a baby
by cesarean section

12:36.223 --> 12:38.022
In the cambodian jungle

12:38.024 --> 12:41.526
Using nothing but the lid
off a can of beans.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.131
Actually, ed,
what you're describing
is quite beautiful.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.900
Not if you're in
the middle of a fully
equipped field hospital

12:48.902 --> 12:51.536
Just trying to get intel
out of a pregnant lady.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.806
For the younger members
of our group,

12:54.808 --> 12:57.108
This was a very turbulent
time in our history.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.177
Nobody was right,
nobody was wrong.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.312
Nobody won,
everyone lost.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.015
I lost a can of beans.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.019
I am so glad
you didn't say the baby.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.489
Okay, everybody,
I'll see you next Tuesday.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.826
Bye.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.227
Nolan, can I talk
to you for a minute?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.929
What are you gonna
talk to him about?

13:17.931 --> 13:22.867
Oh, that's right.
You have doctor-patient
confidentiality.

13:22.869 --> 13:27.138
- I know.
- You remember doctor-patient
confidentiality, don't you?

13:27.140 --> 13:30.375
- Yes, lacey, I do.
- You better.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.410
Okay, maybe I'm being
a little sensitive,

13:32.412 --> 13:35.814
But this seems like
an unusual conversation.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.282
I'll be in the car.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.417
- I'll miss you.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.291
So things are going
well with you guys?

13:46.293 --> 13:49.260
Well, we've spent most
of our relationship driving
around in the car.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.929
I'd like to change
that a little.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.598
But other than that,
things are great.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.067
Nolan, have a seat.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.905
Let me tell you
about a movie I once saw.

14:00.907 --> 14:04.209
It's called
"she's using you."

14:04.211 --> 14:07.412
I never heard of it.
Who's in it?

14:07.414 --> 14:10.081
Tom cruise.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.885
How did I miss it?
I've seen all three
of his movies.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.288
It doesn't matter.
What matters is the point
of the movie.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.592
Which, once again,
is called "she's using you."

14:22.294 --> 14:24.929
It's about a guy
who thinks he's in
a relationship with a girl,

14:24.931 --> 14:28.166
But it turns out
she's what, nolan?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.001
A double agent.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.971
No, no.
She's using him

14:32.973 --> 14:35.306
Because she lost
her license and needs
someone to drive her around

14:35.308 --> 14:37.642
And run her errands
under the guise that
they're dating.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.477
Is this an indian girl?

14:39.479 --> 14:42.280
( sighs )
I'm afraid so.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.482
God, I am such an idiot.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.251
What was I thinking?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.587
There's no way a girl
like lacey could ever
love a loser like me.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.356
Nolan, you're not a loser.

14:51.358 --> 14:55.326
It's just sometimes
we just see things
the way we want to.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.195
What am I gonna do?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.230
You're gonna go out there

14:59.232 --> 15:02.100
And you're gonna pretend
that you figured this out
all by yourself

15:02.102 --> 15:04.135
And you're gonna
talk to her

15:04.137 --> 15:07.505
And it's gonna be okay
because everything you
need is right here.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.977
You're right.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.480
I meant your heart.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.348
You got to slow down
on this stuff, nolan.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.050
I do.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.319
No, I mean you've got
to take it easy on it.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.087
I do.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.296
What was that about?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.665
Nothing.
He just asked me
to move a couch.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.335
And while we were doing that,
I figured out all by myself

15:37.337 --> 15:39.437
That you're using me.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.306
I can't believe
he told you.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.308
You're not the one
who gets to be mad.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.709
You used me, lacey.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.411
Please, that's what
relationships are.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.946
Guys use girls,
girls use guys,

15:47.948 --> 15:49.380
And sometimes girls
use toys because guys

15:49.382 --> 15:51.249
Don't know what
the hell they're doing.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.020
Some people are looking
for more than that.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.423
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.358
I know the only reason
a guy goes out with me

16:00.360 --> 16:02.994
Is because he wants this.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.229
Well, not me.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.665
I don't like you because
of your cocoa skin,

16:07.667 --> 16:10.535
Your crazy big boobs,
or your beautiful
heart-shaped butt.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.139
I don't even notice
those things.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.642
I like you
because of who
you are inside.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.445
Even if you were
just a head in a box,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.513
I'd drive you around.

16:22.515 --> 16:27.518
You'd drive me around
if I was just a head
in a box?

16:27.520 --> 16:30.488
Yeah, put you up
on the dashboard,

16:30.490 --> 16:31.990
Put some sunglasses on you,

16:31.992 --> 16:34.158
Keep the flies off you.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.593
Wow.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.495
You'd still
do that for me?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.301
You know what?

16:43.303 --> 16:46.270
Let's go somewhere
and do something that
you want to do.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.139
Really?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.574
Anything?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.410
Yeah.

16:55.647 --> 16:59.350
Want to go park behind
7-eleven and get stoned?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.020
That is the nicest thing

17:02.022 --> 17:06.257
Anyone's ever asked me
to do behind a 7-eleven.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.063
Why do you have this map

17:12.065 --> 17:14.499
With an arrow blinking
on the olive garden?

17:14.501 --> 17:17.402
It must be where sam's
having dinner right now.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.670
In sydney, australia.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.741
Did she work up an appetite
smoking one of these?

17:23.743 --> 17:27.378
I wanted him to have a clear
head when he spoke to lacey.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.714
He hasn't returned my calls.
Where the hell is he?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.683
I don't know.
Maybe he's with your
daughter in--

17:32.685 --> 17:35.553
Oh, look, they're in
the middle of the ocean now.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.656
Should we get pizza
or seafood?

17:38.658 --> 17:43.327
- Do you like mushrooms?
- This could be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.164
- I like mushrooms.
- ( ringtone plays )

17:46.166 --> 17:48.733
Hello.
Yeah.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.069
Where?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.570
All right,
I'll be right there.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.239
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Where are you going?

17:55.241 --> 17:58.643
Nolan and lacey
just robbed a 7-eleven.
She's in jail.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.548
Mushrooms it is.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.719
- Nolan.
- Charlie.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.122
Thank god you came.
They impounded my car.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.490
What the hell happened?

18:12.492 --> 18:14.792
Well, first lacey
and I got high.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.227
I thought I took
your pot.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.229
You took
my front pocket pot.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.132
I also have back pocket pot,
sock pot, and underwear pot.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.734
Shh!
We're in a police station.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.671
- Just tell me what happened.
- We're behind the 7-eleven.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.773
Lacey decided that she
wanted to make s'mores,

18:28.775 --> 18:32.777
So she stuffed
marshmallows and hershey
bars down her dress.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.880
Who had
the graham crackers?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.716
Damn.
I am so stupid.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.819
We would have had
to go back.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.755
What happened to breaking up?
What happened to standing up
for yourself?

18:44.757 --> 18:47.492
- She's still using you.
- No, not anymore, charlie.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.794
She's different now.
She's changed.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.163
( tapping )

18:54.701 --> 18:59.504
You're on probation.
They can keep you locked
up in here for 30 days.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.772
Relax, I'm having
my dad call his lawyer.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.508
He owes me a favor.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.910
I let him touch
the sides once.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.246
You should have
told them that I was
the one that did it.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.748
That I shoved the marshmallows
down your dress when
you weren't looking.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.750
Trust me,
I thought about it,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.719
But I couldn't
do that to you.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.521
Good for you, lacey.
You've shown a little
bit of growth.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.157
Hopefully the other
prisoners will see that
and not try to stab you.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.830
Well, lacey's in jail.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.700
I'm assuming by now
she's fashioned her iud
into a shiv.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.404
You know, charlie,

19:33.406 --> 19:36.507
We can never imagine

19:36.509 --> 19:39.243
Who our patients
truly are.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.913
The words they tell us

19:41.915 --> 19:44.515
Are like grains of sand

19:44.517 --> 19:46.751
Gathered from the beaches
of their mind

19:46.753 --> 19:49.887
And it is our job
to help them

19:49.889 --> 19:52.857
Collect that sand
and build castles of thought

19:52.859 --> 19:55.927
Which can never
be washed away.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.462
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:58.464 --> 20:00.498
I don't know.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.367
I am completely stoned
out of my mind.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.903
( laughing )

20:05.905 --> 20:08.306
Kate. Kate.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.242
Kate, that was nolan's
front pocket weed.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.413
Oh, my god.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.949
Do I love crunch berries.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.251
Okay, come on.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.986
Let's get you upstairs.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.927
Why is your escalator
always broken?

20:36.969 --> 20:39.003
What the hell
am I doing here?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.371
Hi, kate.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.610
I slept over,
you son of a dick!

20:46.812 --> 20:48.946
I know.
You want some breakfast?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.715
Hell, no!

20:50.717 --> 20:54.018
I already slept over.
I'm not letting this
get any further.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.022
Okay, but I went out
and bought crunch berries.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.957
I hate you.
