00:04.694 --> 00:07.509
<i>CompStat's scheduled</i>
<i>to end at 1300 hours,</i>

00:07.510 --> 00:10.077
and your subsequent meeting with
the mayor has been postponed.

00:10.154 --> 00:13.488
TV interview is scheduled
for noon, Sunday,

00:13.490 --> 00:15.057
which is also
your birthday.

00:16.894 --> 00:18.994
And what does that have
to do with the schedule?

00:18.996 --> 00:21.463
Well, they're gonna want to do
a cake here at One PP.

00:21.465 --> 00:24.800
How's, um, late Friday,
say 5:00?

00:24.802 --> 00:26.568
Who wants cake at 5:00?

00:26.570 --> 00:28.403
Let's not do this again.

00:28.405 --> 00:30.372
I know you don't like
to talk about your birthday.

00:30.605 --> 00:32.405
And yet every time I have one,

00:32.406 --> 00:33.840
you keep wanting
to talk about it.

00:33.842 --> 00:35.908
A lot of people want
to get you presents.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.243
What do I tell them?

00:37.245 --> 00:38.711
I don't know.

00:38.713 --> 00:41.681
Well, how about an “in lieu of
flowers, favorite charities”?

00:41.683 --> 00:42.915
Isn't that for funerals?

00:42.917 --> 00:44.584
Right, okay, um,

00:44.586 --> 00:46.619
let's put this another way.

00:46.621 --> 00:48.788
If people want
to show affection for you,

00:48.790 --> 00:50.590
how do you want
to avoid dealing with it?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.124
That's not what I'm doing.

00:52.126 --> 00:54.293
Who doesn't enjoy
their birthday?

00:54.295 --> 00:57.630
Or at least allow the people
close to them to celebrate it?

00:57.632 --> 00:59.599
Everyone can do
whatever they want.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.701
Just not with you?

01:03.838 --> 01:06.005
Excuse me.

01:10.979 --> 01:13.346
Mrs. Gormley?

01:14.883 --> 01:16.482
Sheila.

01:17.352 --> 01:18.985
Come in.

01:18.987 --> 01:21.187
Oh.

01:23.258 --> 01:24.757
Uh, sit down.

01:24.759 --> 01:26.025
No, thanks.

01:26.027 --> 01:27.860
What brings you to One PP?

01:27.862 --> 01:30.196
Sid forgot his heart pills,

01:30.198 --> 01:32.198
which he needs a lot more
these days because...

01:32.200 --> 01:34.734
Frank...

01:34.736 --> 01:36.969
you're breaking his heart.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.871
What?

01:38.873 --> 01:41.541
He'd never say it to you
in a million years,

01:41.543 --> 01:43.342
but he feels undervalued.

01:43.344 --> 01:44.877
- Nah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:44.879 --> 01:46.312
It's like he's hit...

01:46.314 --> 01:49.181
oh, what do you call
a glass ceiling for a man?

01:49.183 --> 01:50.182
I'm not sure.

01:50.184 --> 01:51.217
You don't think he has

01:51.219 --> 01:53.352
the smarts or the polish

01:53.354 --> 01:54.754
to be a face of this department.

01:54.756 --> 01:56.789
Well, that's just not true.

01:56.791 --> 01:57.890
Well, it's how he feels.

01:57.892 --> 01:58.991
And it's not like

01:58.993 --> 02:00.326
he doesn't turn
down offers.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.294
He does?

02:01.296 --> 02:03.663
Philadelphia could use
a man like Sid,

02:03.665 --> 02:04.830
and a lot of other cities, too.

02:04.832 --> 02:05.932
I'm sure.

02:05.934 --> 02:08.000
He's too modest a man
to ask for it,

02:08.002 --> 02:10.703
but he deserves this respect.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.905
So, thanks for your time,

02:12.907 --> 02:16.042
and do the right thing.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.453 --> 02:26.986
We shouldn't have
ever even gotten a dog.

02:26.988 --> 02:28.955
You got the dog.
Wow.

02:28.957 --> 02:29.922
Way to backtrack.

02:29.924 --> 02:30.957
Hey, guys.
Hey.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.158
How's it going?

02:32.160 --> 02:34.260
Who got a dog?
She did.

02:34.262 --> 02:35.294
What kind of dog?

02:35.296 --> 02:36.495
A beagle.

02:36.497 --> 02:37.496
I love beagles.

02:37.498 --> 02:38.497
Me, too.

02:38.499 --> 02:40.232
Yeah, they're
a whole lot of work.

02:40.234 --> 02:42.134
They got this new thing called
Puppy Playtime or something.

02:42.136 --> 02:43.903
They bring a dozen puppies
to your home or your work,

02:43.905 --> 02:45.371
and you can play
with them for an hour.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.973
Oh, that'd be
perfect for him.

02:46.975 --> 02:49.542
One hour commitment.

02:54.449 --> 02:55.915
Ooh.

03:00.321 --> 03:01.487
Morning.

03:01.489 --> 03:02.755
Sorry I'm late.

03:02.757 --> 03:03.723
Morning.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.558
Just spent two hours
filling out

03:05.560 --> 03:07.426
college loan applications
for my kid.

03:07.428 --> 03:08.694
You know
for the price of college,

03:08.696 --> 03:09.929
I could set the kid
up with his own

03:09.931 --> 03:11.564
small, little
business instead?

03:11.566 --> 03:12.160
Danny.

03:12.184 --> 03:13.500
I'm serious.
Like a diner,

03:13.501 --> 03:15.668
a dry cleaners, a body shop,
you name it.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.336
Danny, there's someone here
to see you.

03:17.338 --> 03:18.838
Where?

03:18.840 --> 03:20.139
He's in the box.

03:20.141 --> 03:21.774
Why is he in the box?

03:21.776 --> 03:23.175
Said he wanted to talk
to you alone,

03:23.177 --> 03:25.111
said he had a deal
for you or something.

03:25.113 --> 03:26.412
Is it a CI?

03:26.414 --> 03:27.780
I don't know,
ask him yourself.

03:30.952 --> 03:33.319
It's “Goodnight” Mason.

03:33.321 --> 03:34.854
Son of a gun.

03:35.523 --> 03:37.456
Good morning,
Goodnight.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.959
It's just Ernie now, Reagan.

03:39.961 --> 03:41.627
Well, it's always gonna be
Goodnight to me.

03:41.629 --> 03:43.229
When'd you get out?

03:43.231 --> 03:44.897
Yesterday.
12 years in the can

03:44.899 --> 03:47.166
and the first person
you come see is me?

03:47.168 --> 03:48.768
I'm... I'm honored.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.069
Suspicious, but honored.

03:50.071 --> 03:51.704
You always said
if there was ever anything

03:51.706 --> 03:53.072
you could do for me
when I get out...

03:53.074 --> 03:55.608
That's... something I say a lot.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.678
It's not actually something
I mean when I say it.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.179
Yeah, I know.

04:00.181 --> 04:01.347
Okay, so?

04:01.349 --> 04:02.815
I got a proposition for you.

04:02.817 --> 04:04.433
You mean you got
a hustle for me.

04:04.457 --> 04:05.352
No.

04:05.353 --> 04:08.058
I want to make amends
for my mistakes...

04:08.082 --> 04:08.488
Good.

04:08.489 --> 04:10.589
...but I'm in danger walking
around in this city.

04:10.591 --> 04:12.692
Yeah, which probably makes it
a good idea

04:12.694 --> 04:14.160
for you to cancel
your homecoming tour,

04:14.162 --> 04:14.779
don't you think?

04:14.803 --> 04:15.996
Well, that's where
you come in.

04:15.997 --> 04:18.430
I will pay you $10,000

04:18.433 --> 04:20.232
to watch my back while
I do my business.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.202
Two days, five grand now,

04:23.204 --> 04:24.403
five when we're done.

04:24.405 --> 04:26.138
I can't take dirty money.
You should know that.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.973
Still got some
of my boxing money,

04:27.975 --> 04:30.543
put some in something
called munis.

04:30.545 --> 04:31.911
It's clean; I can prove it.

04:31.913 --> 04:33.946
I don't doubt it, but why
don't you just offer this

04:33.948 --> 04:35.147
to one of your buddies?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.716
I'm sure they could use
that kind of scratch.

04:36.718 --> 04:38.350
No, they all got records.

04:38.352 --> 04:39.585
Terms of my parole...

04:39.587 --> 04:41.654
No consorting with known felons.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.557
The only nonfelon I know
who has the chops is you...

04:44.559 --> 04:47.760
and you're still a cop,
so I know you need the money.

04:48.696 --> 04:52.398
I'm flattered. Uh...

04:52.400 --> 04:53.866
You're just looking
for a wing man, is that it?

04:53.868 --> 04:55.101
That's all.

04:55.103 --> 04:57.670
No illegal activity whatsoever.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.606
Uh-huh. How long do, uh, I have
to make a decision here?

05:02.710 --> 05:04.777
What? Where are you going?

05:04.779 --> 05:06.112
Going to that little diner
across the street,

05:06.114 --> 05:09.248
get me some eggs and sausage.

05:10.651 --> 05:12.885
Well, you got to give
me a minute here.

05:12.887 --> 05:14.019
Hey!

05:14.021 --> 05:18.257
If I see you there,
I know I got a partner,

05:18.259 --> 05:21.560
and if I don't, I know I won't.

05:26.801 --> 05:28.167
What's the deal?

05:28.169 --> 05:29.502
Guess I'm doing
private security.

05:29.504 --> 05:31.704
He needs private security,
from you?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.606
Yes.

05:33.608 --> 05:35.207
So, what's he paying?
A lot,

05:35.209 --> 05:37.510
but it's not about the money.
Since when?

05:37.512 --> 05:39.145
Since he did 12 years
for prison,

05:39.147 --> 05:41.881
but never gave up the guy
who actually ordered the hit.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.349
Duwan Brown.

05:43.351 --> 05:45.084
Uptown Brown?
That's right.

05:45.086 --> 05:47.186
So, I'm thinking
maybe I work for him

05:47.188 --> 05:49.789
and two birds with one stone.

05:53.761 --> 05:57.761

06:22.365 --> 06:24.143
And why are we going
into the cave?

06:24.243 --> 06:26.110
Because I don't want him
to walk in on us.

06:26.112 --> 06:28.445
It's really not a problem
to just kick it down the road.

06:28.447 --> 06:30.180
I don't want to kick
it down the road.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.549
I want Sid to appear
in my stead.

06:32.551 --> 06:34.251
Sid on <i>Perspectives?</i>

06:34.253 --> 06:35.252
It's the kind of show

06:35.254 --> 06:37.121
where the mayor
sends his deputy,

06:37.123 --> 06:38.822
the governor sends
the lieutenant governor...

06:38.824 --> 06:40.291
I know, but...
So, I am sending Sid.

06:40.293 --> 06:41.425
But Sid...

06:41.427 --> 06:43.460
He is as informed as anybody

06:43.462 --> 06:45.996
about current and future issues
for this department.

06:45.998 --> 06:48.065
True.
But?

06:48.067 --> 06:49.700
But he's not you.

06:49.702 --> 06:50.968
Well, that's why I think
it's such a good idea.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.369
He's a cop's cop.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.071
And I really have a problem
with the “cop's-cop” thing.

06:54.073 --> 06:56.240
Boil it down.
Cop's cop is like

06:56.242 --> 06:59.043
writer's writer
or coach's coach.

06:59.045 --> 07:01.278
It basically means you have
to be in the business

07:01.280 --> 07:03.280
to understand what's really
special about the guy.

07:03.282 --> 07:04.315
It's elitist.

07:04.317 --> 07:05.616
So, Sid's elitist?

07:05.618 --> 07:07.051
Never mind.

07:07.053 --> 07:08.218
And you can prep him.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.020
Oh, thank you.

07:10.022 --> 07:11.221
Have you told him yet?

07:11.223 --> 07:14.091
Oh, I think it's much better
coming from you.

07:14.093 --> 07:15.359
It's your bailiwick.

07:15.361 --> 07:17.361
But it's you who's giving him
the vote of confidence.

07:17.363 --> 07:19.496
Well, you can tell him
it's my idea,

07:19.498 --> 07:22.833
but we don't want to make
a whole bar mitzvah out of this.

07:24.136 --> 07:25.602
Yes, boss.

07:31.711 --> 07:34.845
You got your Dad a wallet
last year for his birthday.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.013
I did?

07:36.015 --> 07:38.515
Yes.
Shoot.

07:38.517 --> 07:40.451
Come on, you can
think of something.

07:40.453 --> 07:41.785
He's hard.

07:41.787 --> 07:44.188
He doesn't have any real
hobbies, just work and family.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.556
Does he like to read?

07:45.558 --> 07:46.590
Tons.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.225
All right, then
buy him a book.

07:48.227 --> 07:49.960
Yeah, but then
he'd have to read it,

07:49.962 --> 07:51.595
and what if he wasn't
interested in it?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.731
Then it wouldn't be a gift,
it'd just be an obligation.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.399
Hey, Reagan, think
you're overthinking

07:55.401 --> 07:56.967
this one a little bit?

07:59.972 --> 08:02.172
That ain't right.
Huh-uh.

08:02.174 --> 08:05.242
They break down
or something?

08:05.244 --> 08:07.578
Something broke down.

08:07.580 --> 08:08.946
Just admit it, you lied.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.547
You're really gonna
do this here, now?

08:10.549 --> 08:12.616
When would be a good time?!

08:12.618 --> 08:14.084
Because it seems
like never!

08:14.086 --> 08:15.519
Oh, here we go,

08:15.521 --> 08:17.121
the bitch is back.

08:17.123 --> 08:19.323
Whoa, all right, okay.

08:19.325 --> 08:21.091
All right, everybody,
move on, show's over.

08:21.093 --> 08:22.259
Why would you do that?

08:22.261 --> 08:24.428
Hey, hey, come on.
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.630
Put your
phone down, please.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.831
What's going on?

08:27.833 --> 08:30.501
Eh, she's mad at me.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.606
Law's changed. Buckle up.

08:35.607 --> 08:37.508
What, you gonna
violate my parole?

08:37.510 --> 08:40.177
It might be. Buckle up.

08:42.948 --> 08:46.383
Anyway, my older boy's 17,
younger boy's 14.

08:46.385 --> 08:47.418
How about you?

08:47.420 --> 08:48.485
Nineteen.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.354
19, huh? When's the last time
you saw him?

08:50.356 --> 08:54.024
First year upstate.
He was all of seven.

08:54.026 --> 08:56.727
Donna brought him up up there
for his birthday.

08:56.729 --> 08:59.029
It upset him so much,
so that was that.

08:59.031 --> 09:01.832
So, is reuniting with him
part of the tour?

09:01.834 --> 09:03.367
Well, he is my son.

09:03.369 --> 09:05.602
Ain't nothing changing that.

09:07.006 --> 09:10.074
I ask you a question?
And you don't have to answer.

09:10.076 --> 09:12.609
It's a free country, allegedly.

09:12.611 --> 09:14.778
You pull the trigger?

09:16.982 --> 09:18.348
What you should've said was,

09:18.350 --> 09:20.684
“Can I ask you something
I already know the answer to?”

09:20.686 --> 09:22.486
I always wondered.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.221
No, you didn't.
You knew.

09:24.223 --> 09:27.691
Your whole body language in
the witness box during my trial

09:27.693 --> 09:29.460
was like a kid in church
about to pee his pants.

09:29.462 --> 09:31.528
Hey. The gun was yours.
You knew.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.596
Oh, I copped to that.

09:32.598 --> 09:34.765
And witnesses placed
you at the scene.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.867
Witnesses placed
a six foot black male

09:36.869 --> 09:39.269
on a block full
of six foot black males.

09:39.271 --> 09:41.572
Look, my job is
to enlighten the jury

09:41.574 --> 09:43.407
as to the facts of the case.

09:43.409 --> 09:45.309
And I never held
that against you...

09:45.311 --> 09:48.212
but maybe you held it
against yourself a little,

09:48.214 --> 09:49.413
which is why we are riding
together right now.

09:49.415 --> 09:50.781
You gonna answer
the question or not?

09:50.783 --> 09:51.782
Did you pull the trigger?

09:51.784 --> 09:53.183
Get in the left lane,

09:53.185 --> 09:55.252
about to take this turn
on 161st.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.423
We've been partners
for almost two years.

09:59.425 --> 10:02.559
That slap didn't look
like a beef between cops.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.361
It was and it wasn't.

10:04.363 --> 10:05.429
It wasn't, period.

10:05.431 --> 10:07.164
How long have you guys
been sleeping together?

10:07.166 --> 10:09.466
Six months.

10:09.468 --> 10:11.101
Seventh anniversary
Saturday.

10:11.103 --> 10:12.603
This is no time
for flowers here, Paul.

10:12.605 --> 10:14.738
People caught your fight
on their cell phones.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.273
Look, there is nothing in the
Patrol Guide about this.

10:16.275 --> 10:17.841
There is in the
common sense guide.

10:17.843 --> 10:19.510
Why haven't one of you
put in for a transfer?

10:19.512 --> 10:20.777
We got a great deal
on a place

10:20.779 --> 10:22.513
just a block outside
the precinct.

10:22.515 --> 10:24.348
Look, you guys
have our backs, right?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.549
It's my fault.

10:25.551 --> 10:27.751
I promise it'll
never happen again.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.077
Hey, don't put
this on us, man.

10:33.692 --> 10:34.825
Hey, boss.

10:34.827 --> 10:36.760
Got a report
of two cops fighting.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.028
Which two of you?

10:38.030 --> 10:40.464
That'd be Officer Bryson
and myself, boss.

10:40.466 --> 10:43.100
What about?
Policy, sir.

10:43.102 --> 10:44.134
Policy?

10:44.136 --> 10:45.769
He wants to practice
“stop and frisk”"

10:45.771 --> 10:47.471
I think it's a civil
rights violation.

10:47.473 --> 10:49.039
Stop and frisk?
It got pretty heated,

10:49.041 --> 10:51.775
but we're...
we're good to go now.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.877
Put your caps back on
and get back to work.

10:53.879 --> 10:55.279
All of you.

11:00.319 --> 11:03.787
Thanks, guys.
We owe you.

11:05.157 --> 11:06.990
I really don't want
anything else to do with this.

11:06.992 --> 11:09.927
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

11:19.905 --> 11:21.104
Morning.

11:21.106 --> 11:22.940
Morning.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.078
Mister, you might
not know it,

11:28.080 --> 11:30.180
but you're definitely
in the wrong place.

11:30.182 --> 11:31.882
I'm in the right place
if you're Donna.

11:33.185 --> 11:35.118
And you're a cop.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.087
Yeah, that's right.

11:37.089 --> 11:38.355
You hear that, everyone?
I'm a cop.

11:38.357 --> 11:39.856
It's okay, relax.
I'm off duty.

11:39.858 --> 11:42.559
Look, I'm just here doing a
favor for an old friend of ours.

11:42.561 --> 11:44.795
You and me don't got
an old friend.

11:44.797 --> 11:46.597
Actually, we do.

11:55.341 --> 11:56.540
Ernie?

11:56.542 --> 11:58.742
Hey, Donna.

12:00.446 --> 12:01.478
You out?

12:01.480 --> 12:03.247
Good eye.

12:03.249 --> 12:05.916
But you had
another six months.

12:05.918 --> 12:08.085
Good behavior.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.288
You shouldn't be here.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.323
That's all you got for me?

12:15.027 --> 12:17.194
You look good.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.264
For a long time
I missed you, but...

12:20.266 --> 12:23.867
after 12 years, baby, yeah,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.402
that's all I got.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.875
If you can just tell me
where our son is,

12:27.877 --> 12:29.076
I'll be on my way.

12:29.078 --> 12:30.611
He don't want to see you.

12:30.613 --> 12:32.346
He's 19. He can tell me that
face-to-face.

12:33.516 --> 12:34.615
Hey! Hey!

12:34.617 --> 12:36.183
Yo, keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

12:36.184 --> 12:36.696
Ronnie.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.756
Get your hands where
I can see 'em, all of you!

12:39.355 --> 12:41.355
- Hey!
- Easy, man.

12:41.357 --> 12:42.423
Ronnie, you got no right.

12:42.425 --> 12:45.092
Goodnight's got a right
to see his boy.

12:46.329 --> 12:50.164
I hear fighting,
and it's not even noon?

12:51.968 --> 12:53.601
Goodnight.

12:55.605 --> 12:57.605
It's just Ernie now, Duwan.

12:57.607 --> 13:01.876
And I ain't here for her,
so you can relax.

13:02.745 --> 13:04.545
I know what you come for.

13:04.547 --> 13:05.780
Gonna take about a day
to get it together.

13:05.782 --> 13:07.648
Shut up, Duwan.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.049
That's a cop.

13:09.051 --> 13:11.752
Hey, that's “Detective” to you.

13:11.754 --> 13:13.387
And nice to meet you,
too, by the way, Duwan.

13:13.389 --> 13:15.322
I just came here
to see my son, that's all.

13:15.324 --> 13:16.924
Oh, okay.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.226
I think we might
have found him.

13:20.429 --> 13:22.463
Seems the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

13:24.734 --> 13:25.866
You promised.

13:25.868 --> 13:27.401
It was boxing
or the gang life.

13:27.403 --> 13:28.869
Tell me what choice
you would have made.

13:28.871 --> 13:31.105
I asked you one thing.
One thing!

13:31.107 --> 13:33.007
Ernie, I did the right thing.
No, no, you didn't!

13:33.009 --> 13:34.208
- Yes, I did.
- Easy.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.911
You swore to me!
Hey, put it away.

13:36.913 --> 13:38.579
Danny, get off me!
Time to go, come on.

13:38.581 --> 13:39.935
The type of mother
you turned out to be.

13:39.936 --> 13:41.147
What kind of a father are you?

13:41.148 --> 13:43.006
Where you been
the last 12 years?

13:43.007 --> 13:44.468
Some kind of mother
you turned out to be!

13:44.492 --> 13:46.441
Time to go. Time to go.

14:00.478 --> 14:02.311
All right, show me
something now, Shawn.

14:02.313 --> 14:03.278
Come on, take it to him.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.913
Keep it coming, baby.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.582
Two more days.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.083
Two more days and
this show is real.

14:08.085 --> 14:09.985
Come on, come on!

14:12.423 --> 14:14.423
He's setting him up like
his old man-- look at that.

14:14.425 --> 14:15.858
But he's dropping
the left.

14:18.329 --> 14:21.330
Looks like Goodnight Jr.
inherited the Goodnight punch.

14:21.332 --> 14:23.666
Blessing and a curse.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.671
Anybody in there
I should be worried about?

14:28.673 --> 14:31.006
His trainer, Khalid...

14:31.876 --> 14:34.109
...thinks he did three years
because of me.

14:34.111 --> 14:35.577
Did he?

14:35.579 --> 14:38.347
Just have my back.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.654
“Street Fight” Mason.

14:48.559 --> 14:51.927
More like “Playground” Mason.

14:57.201 --> 14:59.501
What you doing here,
old man?

15:01.439 --> 15:03.005
I came here to see you.

15:09.013 --> 15:10.379
You see me?

15:10.381 --> 15:12.247
Good.

15:12.249 --> 15:13.882
Now get out of here.

15:13.884 --> 15:14.950
We don't need no
distractions, Mason.

15:14.952 --> 15:16.318
He got a fight
coming up fast.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.053
He's not a distraction,
he's the kid's father, okay?

15:18.055 --> 15:20.122
- Show some respect.
- I got this.

15:20.124 --> 15:21.890
Who the hell are you?

15:21.892 --> 15:24.159
And you got nothing
for me.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.228
Just want to take you
out for dinner, son.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.863
You gonna leave,

15:27.865 --> 15:29.164
or do I got to
bounce your ass out?

15:29.166 --> 15:30.799
Don't you ever talk
to me like that.

15:30.801 --> 15:33.435
I talk to you
anyways I want.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.106
This guy's not my father.

15:37.108 --> 15:38.440
He's just a ghost.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.943
Please, Shawn, one meal.

15:40.945 --> 15:41.977
One hour out of your life.

15:41.979 --> 15:43.712
You just had all the time
I got for you.

15:43.714 --> 15:45.414
Listen, I'm still
your father.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.049
I'm not your son!

15:47.051 --> 15:48.717
Hey! Hey!

15:48.719 --> 15:50.018
Hey...
Hey,

15:50.020 --> 15:51.887
back up!

15:51.889 --> 15:53.655
He's on parole.
So?

15:53.657 --> 15:55.791
So if he hits you,
he's going back to prison.

15:55.793 --> 15:57.426
One sucker punch is enough!

15:57.428 --> 16:01.363
You okay?
You all right?

16:01.365 --> 16:04.066
Forget what I said
about “Playground.”

16:04.068 --> 16:06.869
Boy, that is
a hell of a right.

16:07.738 --> 16:09.571
I'm sorry I hit you.

16:10.441 --> 16:12.908
Maybe I deserved it.

16:13.878 --> 16:16.445
Look, I gotta
get back to work.

16:16.447 --> 16:20.048
Yeah, this ain't going
the way I planned it.

16:20.050 --> 16:21.416
No.

16:21.418 --> 16:23.252
The whole time
I'm thinking of him,

16:23.254 --> 16:24.920
what kept me going
was knowing

16:24.922 --> 16:26.622
that he was thinking
about me, too.

16:26.624 --> 16:28.657
Try not to take it personal.

16:28.659 --> 16:29.958
That's how kids are.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.560
Whether you're coming home
from prison or work,

16:31.562 --> 16:32.895
that's just how they are.

16:32.897 --> 16:35.097
I ain't buying that.

16:35.099 --> 16:36.698
But nice try.

16:40.771 --> 16:41.937
He say why?

16:41.939 --> 16:43.071
Not really.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.940
Am I being punished
for something?

16:44.942 --> 16:45.908
I don't think so.

16:45.910 --> 16:48.277
Would you tell me if I was?
Sure.

16:48.279 --> 16:50.746
Then do, because
making me get on TV

16:50.748 --> 16:52.080
has got to be punishment
for something.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.048
Not at all.

16:53.050 --> 16:54.550
He said you're
a cop's cop,

16:54.552 --> 16:56.218
and up to speed
on all the issues,

16:56.220 --> 16:57.319
so he's sending you.

16:57.321 --> 16:58.287
Take it as a compliment.

16:58.289 --> 16:59.688
To you it's
a compliment, maybe.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.723
To me it's a curse.
You'll do fine.

17:01.725 --> 17:04.827
I'll short out the microphone
sweating through my suit.

17:04.829 --> 17:07.829
It's his birthday Sunday.
Did you get him something?

17:07.832 --> 17:09.097
No, not yet.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.165
You know,
the whole family

17:10.166 --> 17:11.967
goes over to his house
every Sunday.

17:11.969 --> 17:13.402
Maybe you, me,
and Baker could go in

17:13.404 --> 17:15.804
on a gift certificate
to Peter Lugar's.

17:15.806 --> 17:17.439
But don't you get the feeling
they do it at the house

17:17.441 --> 17:18.840
'cause that's how
he wants it?

17:18.843 --> 17:20.108
Yeah, there's that.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.077
Well, he can take
whoever whenever.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.579
You tell him?

17:23.580 --> 17:25.180
Just broke the news.

17:25.182 --> 17:27.316
The good news.

17:27.318 --> 17:28.416
What do you think?

17:28.419 --> 17:29.885
I'm so honored, boss.

17:29.887 --> 17:31.420
I'll make you proud, I swear.

17:31.422 --> 17:32.588
Oh, I know you will, Sid.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.089
I'm just sorry I didn't
think of it sooner.

17:34.091 --> 17:37.793
Well, there's no time
like the present, as they say.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.595
Can't wait to see it.

17:48.672 --> 17:52.107
That we didn't report it
doesn't get you off the hook.

17:52.109 --> 17:54.109
We're not on a hook,
and it's none of your business.

17:54.111 --> 17:56.912
Janko and I came across
you guys having a fight,

17:56.914 --> 17:59.047
and any fool could see
it was a lover's thing.

17:59.049 --> 18:00.382
Like you and Janko
never have.

18:01.886 --> 18:04.019
What? No, we haven't.

18:04.021 --> 18:05.420
We've never gotten together.

18:05.422 --> 18:07.155
Ask anyone
in this house, Reagan.

18:07.157 --> 18:08.167
We all know
that you're banging her.

18:08.191 --> 18:09.092
Hey, look, I just told you--

18:09.093 --> 18:11.159
Hey, get your hands off!

18:11.161 --> 18:12.728
What do you mean you don't
know what I'm talking about?

18:12.730 --> 18:14.663
You two are together,
and everybody knows it.

18:14.665 --> 18:16.732
I just said we're not.

18:16.734 --> 18:18.634
Wow, Janko, did I
read you wrong.

18:18.636 --> 18:21.069
Well, you know, whatever
you think you know...

18:21.071 --> 18:22.771
I <i>thought</i> I knew
you were a stand-up cop,

18:22.773 --> 18:24.339
but I guess 'cause
he's a Reagan,

18:24.341 --> 18:26.408
you can count on the bosses
looking the other way.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.043
Well, there's nothing for
them to look away from.

18:28.045 --> 18:29.311
Copy that, Blondie-blonde.

18:29.313 --> 18:30.812
Get your house
in order, man.

18:30.814 --> 18:32.648
Or what, you gonna
go to the CO?

18:32.650 --> 18:33.749
With what?

18:33.751 --> 18:34.917
Must have been
a dozen people

18:34.919 --> 18:36.518
that saw that slap
on their cell phones.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.353
The clock's ticking till
one of the bosses sees it.

18:38.355 --> 18:39.190
Get out ahead of it.

18:39.214 --> 18:40.590
Or you're gonna tell on us?

18:40.591 --> 18:42.090
I'm not in sixth grade,
and neither are you.

18:42.092 --> 18:44.359
But you're putting your life
and your partner's in danger

18:44.361 --> 18:46.228
taking your eye off the ball
like that today.

18:46.230 --> 18:48.397
You know what?
Screw you, Kelsey.

18:48.399 --> 18:50.132
I'm just trying
to help you out here.

18:50.134 --> 18:51.767
No, you're afraid that
if they turn on that light,

18:51.769 --> 18:53.402
it's gonna land on you two.

18:53.404 --> 18:55.537
So you're not gonna say a thing.
Am I right?

18:55.539 --> 18:57.472
Guess what, I'm not
afraid of your light,

18:57.474 --> 18:58.974
because we're not together.

18:58.976 --> 19:01.543
You try to jam me up,
I'll jam you right back.

19:01.545 --> 19:03.111
Reagan hook or not.

19:07.451 --> 19:09.618
You know,
back at Jerk Street,

19:09.620 --> 19:12.487
Duwan, he said he owed you.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.490
What?

19:15.492 --> 19:17.392
Is that some kind
of detective thing?

19:17.394 --> 19:19.361
You sit on the question
until your sixth sense

19:19.363 --> 19:20.696
tells you the time is right?

19:20.698 --> 19:22.464
Screw you.
What'd he mean?

19:22.466 --> 19:25.400
He owes me a hundred grand.

19:25.402 --> 19:26.868
He promised it to me
if I kept my mouth shut

19:26.870 --> 19:27.970
and did my time.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.972
Kept your mouth shut
about what?

19:29.974 --> 19:32.274
Who pulled the trigger.

19:34.111 --> 19:35.577
So it wasn't you?

19:35.579 --> 19:36.945
I answered your question,
all right?

19:36.947 --> 19:38.013
Don't push it.

19:38.015 --> 19:40.215
We're up here
on the right.

19:50.761 --> 19:52.627
- You check in already?
- Yesterday.

19:52.629 --> 19:54.596
You use your name?

19:54.598 --> 19:55.864
Yeah. Why?

19:55.866 --> 19:56.898
What's the room number?

19:56.900 --> 19:58.233
315. What's this all about?

19:58.235 --> 20:01.069
Just doing my job.
Sit tight.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.061
Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:26.063 --> 20:27.362
My associates and I

20:27.364 --> 20:29.631
are supposed to meet Mr. Mason
in room 315.

20:29.633 --> 20:30.932
Has anyone showed up yet?

20:30.934 --> 20:33.368
315's not back yet.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.208
Oh, your associates.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.209
Well, one's over there

20:41.211 --> 20:42.477
in that chair
by that lamp.

20:42.479 --> 20:43.578
Right by the door there?

20:43.580 --> 20:46.148
Yeah.

20:46.150 --> 20:48.216
I don't see the other one.

20:48.218 --> 20:50.886
Okay.

21:02.699 --> 21:05.067
Stay there.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.702
Stay in the car.

21:07.704 --> 21:10.572
Hey. Hey!

21:12.409 --> 21:13.909
Hey!

21:13.911 --> 21:15.577
I'm talking to you.

21:15.579 --> 21:18.080
Hey!

21:21.919 --> 21:23.652
Goodnight, get down!

21:41.432 --> 21:43.099
Goodnight, you okay?

21:43.101 --> 21:45.434
How many times I got to tell
you? It's Ernie now!

21:45.436 --> 21:47.837
Right. Well, it was almost
good night for good.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.439
You just keep earning
your keep, Reagan.

21:50.441 --> 21:54.777
This is Detective Reagan
at 356 West 31st.

21:54.779 --> 21:57.513
We got shots fired
at this location.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.188
Anything you need before I go?

22:06.524 --> 22:10.526
Oh, no, look, I'm-I'm sorry,
I lost track of time.

22:10.528 --> 22:12.395
Um, I didn't mean
to keep you so late.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.397
It's not a problem.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.598
Good night, sir.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.266
Baker?

22:17.268 --> 22:19.235
When's it due again?

22:19.237 --> 22:21.504
He, sir.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.639
The “it” is a boy.

22:23.641 --> 22:26.976
Right, I knew that.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.244
He due?

22:28.246 --> 22:30.112
Around the end of next month.

22:30.114 --> 22:31.948
Oh, yeah, of course.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.850
See you tomorrow.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.484
Baker...

22:37.856 --> 22:41.691
I know I don't always
think to say it,

22:41.693 --> 22:43.793
what with the speed of things
around here,

22:43.795 --> 22:47.797
but I really do appreciate
the hard work

22:47.799 --> 22:50.900
and dedication you put
into the your job.

22:51.736 --> 22:54.303
I just wanted to say that.

22:54.305 --> 22:56.539
Thank you.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.974
Appreciate that.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.843
Good night.

23:05.383 --> 23:06.682
Sir,

23:06.684 --> 23:10.253
is there something I should
know about your birthday?

23:11.122 --> 23:14.056
You already know
about my birthday.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.225
I know.

23:16.227 --> 23:18.694
It's just unusual to avoid them

23:18.696 --> 23:22.098
with as much vigor
and purpose as you do.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.500
Something in the past?

23:24.502 --> 23:25.701
What?

23:25.703 --> 23:27.470
Uh...

23:27.472 --> 23:30.539
Look, I-I just have
always felt very lucky

23:30.541 --> 23:33.009
to have grown up
in such a good family.

23:33.011 --> 23:36.045
Seemed like overkill,
a special day for myself.

23:36.047 --> 23:39.348
Ah.

23:39.350 --> 23:40.983
Good night, sir.

23:40.985 --> 23:43.352
Good night, Baker.

23:58.202 --> 23:59.936
All right, Baez. Yeah.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.071
Yeah, copy that.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.373
How the hell do you
call this a safe house?

24:04.375 --> 24:06.042
The roaches are big enough
to mug somebody.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.810
Look, the plates
on the shooter car

24:07.812 --> 24:09.478
came back to
a Segundo Perrera.

24:09.480 --> 24:13.015
He's got a history of doing
business with Duwan Brown.

24:13.017 --> 24:14.583
Might've figured that.

24:14.585 --> 24:17.053
What is it? He doesn't want
to pay you what he owes you?

24:17.055 --> 24:19.922
Maybe, or maybe he don't want
me around Donna and my son.

24:19.924 --> 24:21.457
Why would you say that?

24:21.459 --> 24:24.060
You saw the way
he moved in on Donna.

24:24.062 --> 24:25.361
And Brown and Khalid been
running together

24:25.363 --> 24:26.529
since they was pups.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.531
And now he's coincidentally
my son's trainer?

24:28.533 --> 24:29.565
You figure it out.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.901
I'd say follow the money.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.337
However you cut it, I'm cut out.

24:34.339 --> 24:37.039
Man's got my money
and my family,

24:37.041 --> 24:39.408
and all I got is a night
in a roach motel.

24:39.410 --> 24:42.645
Well, look, you may not actually
have that anymore either.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.746
What?

24:43.748 --> 24:45.247
The second those guys
fired the shots

24:45.249 --> 24:47.616
and I called it in,
this became an NYPD case.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.753
Which means if
you don't cooperate,

24:50.755 --> 24:53.189
then you're on your own,
you're on the streets.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.590
Cooperate how?

24:54.592 --> 24:55.925
Help me catch Brown.

24:57.395 --> 25:00.062
What's so funny?
Oh, the way you said,

25:00.064 --> 25:01.697
“Help me catch Brown.”

25:01.699 --> 25:02.965
Oh, man.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.333
Should have some
inspirational music playing

25:04.335 --> 25:07.370
or something.

25:07.372 --> 25:08.377
What is that?

25:08.401 --> 25:10.401
It's that second cashier's check
for five grand.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.008
You saved my life,
I guess you earned it.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.110
This is an NYPD case now.

25:14.112 --> 25:15.111
I can't take that.

25:15.113 --> 25:16.445
Well, I guess we're done.

25:16.447 --> 25:17.847
What are you talking about?

25:17.849 --> 25:21.050
That man ain't gonna give me
the money that he promised me,

25:21.052 --> 25:23.352
and I'm not gonna get killed
trying to find it.

25:23.354 --> 25:26.589
Shawn's lost to me,
so is Donna.

25:26.591 --> 25:29.191
I got to find a life somewhere,

25:29.193 --> 25:30.726
but it damn sure ain't here.

25:30.728 --> 25:32.428
Look, Ernie, wait...

25:32.430 --> 25:34.196
Oh, it's Ernie now?

25:34.198 --> 25:35.898
Look, you do got a life here.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.600
But Brown, he's just putting up
a roadblock.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.069
It's up to you to help me
nail the son of a bitch

25:40.071 --> 25:41.670
and get your life
back for yourself.

25:41.672 --> 25:43.472
I'm a free man, Danny.

25:43.474 --> 25:46.942
After 12 long years
I can walk where, when,

25:46.944 --> 25:48.944
and as far as I want to.

25:50.148 --> 25:55.618
So please,
don't try to stop me.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.460
According to him,
everyone in the house

26:04.462 --> 26:05.694
thinks we're doing it, too.

26:05.696 --> 26:07.797
Doing what?

26:07.799 --> 26:10.533
You know, doing <i>it.</i>

26:10.535 --> 26:12.401
The hubba-hubba?

26:12.403 --> 26:14.103
The horizontal tango?

26:14.105 --> 26:15.971
Shut up.

26:15.973 --> 26:19.041
Reagan, I bet you got every
merit badge the Scouts give out.

26:19.043 --> 26:21.844
Seriously, what do you
want to do about this?

26:21.846 --> 26:24.313
All units 10-13,

26:24.315 --> 26:26.849
confines of the 12th precinct
at 31 West 39 Street.

26:26.851 --> 26:28.884
Violent EDP, units responding.

26:28.886 --> 26:31.153
12-David, show us responding.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.794
Calm down, all right?
All right? Hold on.

26:38.796 --> 26:41.397
50 cents a slice!
50 cents!

26:42.200 --> 26:43.732
Step aside!
Hey, make a hole.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.267
Step aside!
Make a hole.

26:45.269 --> 26:46.635
Step aside.

26:46.637 --> 26:47.434
50 cents!

26:47.458 --> 26:48.538
No, you're not.
Hey, what happened?

26:48.539 --> 26:50.372
You tell me I'm crazy.
You're crazy.

26:50.374 --> 26:52.875
Book says isolate and contain,
but she-she just went right in there.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.477
Let me guess, 'cause she doesn't
take orders from you?

26:54.479 --> 26:55.911
- Close enough.
- Go ahead!

26:55.913 --> 26:57.179
What are you gonna do?

26:57.181 --> 26:59.915
Eddie, come around the back.
You're the one with the gun.

26:59.917 --> 27:01.784
I bet no one tells you
you're crazy.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.386
Hey, hey,
somebody try to rip you off?

27:04.388 --> 27:06.655
Pizza is 50 cents a slice!

27:06.657 --> 27:08.624
Damn right it is.
Two slices for a dollar.

27:08.626 --> 27:09.692
Who the hell are you?

27:09.694 --> 27:10.926
I'm Officer Reagan.

27:10.928 --> 27:12.828
They're telling me
it's two dollars a slice!

27:12.830 --> 27:15.264
Well, it's against the law,
which is exactly why I'm here.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.699
Says so right there on the wall.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.234
Look it! See?

27:18.236 --> 27:19.735
Am I right?
50 cents a slice.

27:19.737 --> 27:22.071
Two slices for a buck, buck
and a quarter gets you a soda.

27:25.877 --> 27:27.143
No!

27:29.814 --> 27:31.814
You're all right, you're all right.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.618
You're okay, you're okay.
It's not fair.

27:40.091 --> 27:42.691
Lieutenant Gormley
would like a word, sir.

27:42.693 --> 27:44.293
Send him in.

27:44.295 --> 27:45.828
And Mrs. Gormley.

27:46.664 --> 27:49.265
Send them in.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.403
Sid, Sheila.

27:54.405 --> 27:56.505
Boss, we have
a confession to make.

27:56.507 --> 27:58.007
She does.
I do.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.675
After the taping,

27:59.677 --> 28:01.110
which went okay by the way.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.045
I know that,
congratulations.

28:03.047 --> 28:04.813
Sheila slipped that
she paid you a visit.

28:04.815 --> 28:07.616
when I pressed,
she told me what she said.

28:07.618 --> 28:09.018
Sheila?

28:09.020 --> 28:10.519
I might've given you
the impression

28:10.521 --> 28:12.688
that Sid felt
he was undervalued here.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.789
Sheila?

28:13.791 --> 28:16.592
Fine, I said so much.

28:16.594 --> 28:18.093
That wasn't from Sid,
just from me.

28:18.095 --> 28:19.962
I just want him to be
all he can be.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.031
I just wanted you to hear it
from the source.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.566
Good policy.
And, boss,

28:23.568 --> 28:25.968
I just want you to know,
I'm very happy

28:25.970 --> 28:27.336
and proud to be
working here.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.072
And have never considered
a job in Philadelphia

28:30.074 --> 28:31.774
or anywhere else,
nor would I.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.576
Glad to hear it.
The last thing I would want

28:33.578 --> 28:35.244
is a job anything like yours.

28:35.246 --> 28:38.314
The weight on you,
the isolation it brings,

28:38.316 --> 28:41.283
what must be the
sleepless nights

28:41.285 --> 28:42.451
and unrelenting pressure

28:42.453 --> 28:45.254
and the no pleasing
nobody nohow. Honest.

28:46.757 --> 28:48.824
And... happy birthday.

28:48.826 --> 28:51.794
from me, Garrett
and Abigail.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.629
Arrive hungry and enjoy.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.832
Spoil the surprise.

28:58.669 --> 29:00.469
Thank you.

29:00.471 --> 29:02.638
Here's to many more to come.

29:13.985 --> 29:17.620
Pop, anything bad happen on
my birthday when I was a kid?

29:17.622 --> 29:19.588
What do you mean?

29:19.590 --> 29:23.425
Oh, I don't know, plane crash,
ship sunk, something like that.

29:23.427 --> 29:24.927
No, nothing like that.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.063
Just that Ranger game
when you turned nine.

29:31.602 --> 29:33.269
I remember.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.803
What do you remember?

29:34.805 --> 29:36.839
Oh, you just moved
to a new school,

29:36.841 --> 29:39.041
so I got tickets
to the game

29:39.043 --> 29:42.745
for all the boys
in your new class.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.113
And?

29:44.115 --> 29:47.916
And I'd gotten the date
I gave their parents mixed up.

29:47.918 --> 29:49.718
So you and I
arrived and, uh...

29:49.720 --> 29:53.389
None of the boys showed up.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.657
Well, there were
no cell phones,

29:54.659 --> 29:56.425
there was no way
to contact them.

29:57.361 --> 30:01.063
But maybe you felt like
all the guys just...

30:01.065 --> 30:04.366
bailed on your birthday.

30:04.368 --> 30:06.669
I probably did.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.003
Anyway,

30:08.005 --> 30:10.928
water under the bridge.

30:24.934 --> 30:27.835
Got it. They found the car
an hour ago off the Deegan.

30:27.837 --> 30:29.771
They're tossing it
and dusting for fingerprints.

30:29.773 --> 30:31.172
They're bound to find something.

30:31.174 --> 30:33.875
Yeah. The fingerprints of two
guys who are now in the wind.

30:33.877 --> 30:35.576
Detective Reagan?
Yeah.

30:35.578 --> 30:37.779
Got a visitor.

30:44.187 --> 30:46.421
Thank you.

30:47.891 --> 30:51.259
I sat in Penn Station all night
looking at that Amtrak board.

30:52.796 --> 30:55.196
But everybody I know

30:55.198 --> 30:57.765
is still here.

30:57.767 --> 31:00.368
Right.

31:01.237 --> 31:03.171
I reached out to Duwan.

31:03.173 --> 31:05.840
Set up a meeting.

31:05.842 --> 31:07.809
Trying to make peace.

31:07.811 --> 31:10.044
And to get the money?

31:10.046 --> 31:12.847
No. It's blood money.

31:12.849 --> 31:16.117
I don't want anything
to do with any of that.

31:16.119 --> 31:19.053
But it occurred to me

31:19.055 --> 31:21.923
that the meeting could be
a rope-a-dope in its own way.

31:21.925 --> 31:23.291
How's that?

31:23.293 --> 31:25.059
Ali thought of a rope-a-dope

31:25.061 --> 31:27.628
as a way to lull his opponents

31:27.630 --> 31:31.165
into thinking he was against
the ropes and all out of gas.

31:31.167 --> 31:33.568
Making them careless.

31:33.570 --> 31:35.737
Duwan gets a little loose
with the mouth,

31:35.739 --> 31:37.739
I'm not wearing a wire.

31:37.741 --> 31:40.508
So you have to think
of something.

31:41.411 --> 31:44.312
And where is this get-together?

31:44.314 --> 31:45.780
Jerk Street.

31:45.782 --> 31:47.715
They serve food there.

31:47.717 --> 31:49.484
What are the tables like?

31:49.486 --> 31:51.819
What...
What're you thinking about?

31:51.821 --> 31:53.354
You know,
salt and pepper shakers,

31:53.356 --> 31:54.455
ketchup bottle,

31:54.457 --> 31:56.257
mustard bottle,
hot sauce.

31:56.259 --> 31:58.760
Napkins dispensers.

31:58.762 --> 32:01.262
Things that
could be wired.

32:01.264 --> 32:03.664
And when's this sit-down?

32:03.666 --> 32:06.267
Tomorrow night,

32:06.269 --> 32:09.937
after I watch my son's fight.

32:27.023 --> 32:28.156
Hey.
Hey.

32:28.158 --> 32:29.924
Kelsey just put in
for a transfer.

32:29.926 --> 32:32.326
Yeah, I heard.
Paul actually apologized to me.

32:32.328 --> 32:34.896
Do you feel like
eating or drinking or both?

32:34.898 --> 32:36.197
Both.

32:36.199 --> 32:37.365
Does it bother you

32:37.367 --> 32:38.733
at all, that everyone
in the house

32:38.735 --> 32:40.501
assumes that we're doing it?

32:40.503 --> 32:41.702
Doing what?

32:41.704 --> 32:43.171
Shut up.

32:43.173 --> 32:44.472
I'm just gonna ignore it.

32:44.474 --> 32:45.907
Nothing we can do
about it anyway.

32:45.909 --> 32:48.075
It'd be like trying to put
toothpaste back in the tube.

32:48.077 --> 32:49.243
I guess you're right.

32:49.245 --> 32:52.280
Of course I'm right. And
also, it occurs to me,

32:52.282 --> 32:53.948
since everyone's
already thinking it...

32:53.950 --> 32:55.149
Even though we haven't
done anything.

32:55.151 --> 32:56.551
We're paying the price
for something

32:56.553 --> 32:57.952
we didn't get
the benefits of.

32:57.954 --> 32:59.687
Benefits. I like
how you're thinking.

32:59.689 --> 33:01.489
I'm glad to hear
you say that.

33:01.491 --> 33:03.758
But, um, no can do.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.127
No?

33:06.129 --> 33:08.029
See, once you've tapped this,

33:08.031 --> 33:10.865
there's no going back.

33:10.867 --> 33:12.800
I'd be spoiled for life.

33:12.802 --> 33:16.137
Yes. Now you're getting it.

33:26.182 --> 33:28.316
Sure you don't want to
go try and find him?

33:28.318 --> 33:30.117
No. I'm gonna give him room.

33:30.119 --> 33:31.819
Okay.

33:31.821 --> 33:34.021
That stuff works.
You see his knees buckle?

33:35.658 --> 33:37.391
You see this?
Hey, what's up?

33:37.393 --> 33:39.460
Congratulations, kid.

33:41.631 --> 33:43.865
You got something.

33:43.867 --> 33:46.868
Yo...
No, no, I got this.

33:50.306 --> 33:52.373
The Irishman didn't have much.

33:52.375 --> 33:54.609
No need to talk down
your opponent.

33:54.611 --> 33:57.211
Plenty of people
will do it for you.

33:59.282 --> 34:00.948
Thanks for coming.

34:00.950 --> 34:03.484
Wouldn't have missed it
for anything in the world.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.920
Anyways, uh...

34:05.922 --> 34:06.988
I'm meeting some people, so...

34:06.990 --> 34:09.489
I wouldn't want to hold you.

34:10.293 --> 34:11.559
One meal.

34:11.561 --> 34:13.761
My treat.

34:21.938 --> 34:24.071
If you're free tomorrow night,

34:24.072 --> 34:25.572
maybe we could eat.

34:25.574 --> 34:27.440
I'd like that.

34:27.443 --> 34:30.244
I'll see you at around 7:00?

34:31.080 --> 34:33.313
Yes, you will.

35:03.546 --> 35:06.013
Stand up, Goodnight.

35:17.927 --> 35:19.293
Okay.

35:25.501 --> 35:27.101
Here we are.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.637
I appreciate you taking
this sit-down with me.

35:29.639 --> 35:31.505
It's what's right.

35:31.507 --> 35:33.407
Donna.

35:33.409 --> 35:35.343
Drinks?

35:35.345 --> 35:36.510
Cognac and milk, right?

35:36.512 --> 35:37.812
Right.

35:42.318 --> 35:43.784
He won.

35:43.786 --> 35:46.153
I heard.

35:46.155 --> 35:48.322
You still can't watch, huh?

35:48.324 --> 35:49.590
Same as ever.

35:49.592 --> 35:51.125
Get this crap out off the table.

35:51.127 --> 35:52.760
We're not eating nothing.

35:56.499 --> 35:57.298
What?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.632
Got something in my eye.

35:58.634 --> 35:59.867
Let me take
a look.

35:59.869 --> 36:01.869
Go on,
leave us be.

36:14.951 --> 36:16.684
You really don't want the money?

36:16.686 --> 36:17.885
Oh, I want it.

36:17.887 --> 36:19.854
As payment to you.

36:19.856 --> 36:21.489
For leaving me be.

36:21.491 --> 36:23.457
A hundred grand to leave me be.

36:23.459 --> 36:25.226
I'll leave you be for free.

36:25.228 --> 36:26.894
Got some trouble
the other night.

36:26.896 --> 36:29.030
Somebody took a shot at me.

36:29.032 --> 36:31.098
Sorry to hear that.

36:31.934 --> 36:33.868
Leave me be.

36:34.704 --> 36:37.304
And that's it?

36:38.441 --> 36:41.042
Why did you have Charlie
use my gun to kill Stennis?

36:41.044 --> 36:43.744
Who said I...
Duwan, I did 12 years.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.881
You owe me the truth.

36:46.883 --> 36:48.582
Now, you told me
to draw Charlie outside,

36:48.584 --> 36:49.984
and give him a beatdown

36:49.986 --> 36:52.787
but you never said nothing
about shooting him.

36:54.657 --> 36:56.791
No, I didn't.

36:56.793 --> 36:59.660
I had Charlie shoot him.

36:59.662 --> 37:01.862
But I needed you
to draw him out.

37:01.864 --> 37:03.564
He trusted you.

37:03.566 --> 37:06.634
And we used your gun
so you couldn't turn on us.

37:06.636 --> 37:08.369
We got it.

37:08.371 --> 37:11.605
Well, we agreed to wait until
he walks out the front door.

37:14.243 --> 37:16.577
Well, that's that.

37:17.413 --> 37:19.814
I'm not gonna see you again?

37:20.650 --> 37:22.650
You have my word.

37:26.522 --> 37:28.322
Go out the back.

37:28.324 --> 37:30.124
Why?

37:30.126 --> 37:32.593
I got guys out front.

37:32.595 --> 37:35.763
If this didn't go
how I wanted,

37:35.765 --> 37:37.832
they're waiting out front.

37:37.834 --> 37:39.333
You understand?

37:52.215 --> 37:54.415
Go! Go! Go!

38:11.400 --> 38:13.100
Drop it!
Police! Drop it!

38:13.102 --> 38:15.369
Turn around. Get over there.

38:15.371 --> 38:18.005
I got it.

38:19.375 --> 38:21.742
Call a bus. Call a bus!

38:21.744 --> 38:24.464
Uh, Central, Central,
we need a bus, forthwith, at location.

38:42.532 --> 38:46.167

38:46.169 --> 38:50.304

39:09.225 --> 39:10.991
Yeah!
Yay!

39:10.993 --> 39:12.293
What'd you wish for?

39:12.295 --> 39:13.661
Didn't come true.

39:13.663 --> 39:15.763
How do you know?
She's still here.

39:15.765 --> 39:16.964
Never gets old.

39:16.966 --> 39:18.432
Are we doing presents?

39:18.434 --> 39:19.967
Mine first.
No. Mine.

39:19.969 --> 39:20.901
No time.

39:20.903 --> 39:21.902
What do you mean, no time?

39:21.904 --> 39:23.737
The van is already out front.

39:23.739 --> 39:24.972
You still got the box
the cake came in?

39:24.974 --> 39:26.640
In the kitchen. Why?

39:26.642 --> 39:27.908
Okay. We'll take
the cake with us

39:27.910 --> 39:29.376
and we'll do the presents later.

39:29.378 --> 39:30.477
The van to where?

39:30.479 --> 39:31.946
The Garden.

39:31.948 --> 39:33.647
Rangers versus Chicago.

39:33.649 --> 39:35.249
I want to get there
for the warmups.

39:35.251 --> 39:36.617
Wait. All of us?

39:36.619 --> 39:39.153
Yes. All of us in a row,
two rows,

39:39.155 --> 39:40.721
behind
the Rangers bench.

39:40.723 --> 39:43.057
It's a surprise,
for my birthday.

39:43.059 --> 39:45.359
Boys, grab the box
and some paper plates.

39:45.361 --> 39:46.504
On it.

39:46.528 --> 39:48.430
And grab some plastic
forks from the drawer.

39:48.431 --> 39:49.897
Who's ever heard
of someone throwing

39:49.899 --> 39:50.965
their own surprise
birthday party?

39:50.967 --> 39:52.132
I invented it.

39:52.134 --> 39:53.467
Get going here.
Come on, chop-chop.

39:53.469 --> 39:54.969
Get your coats.

39:54.971 --> 39:56.370
Come on, people!

39:56.372 --> 39:57.771
Let's go, Rangers.

39:57.773 --> 39:58.939
Let's go, Rangers.

39:58.941 --> 40:01.642
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Rangers.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.614
Let's go, Rangers.

40:06.616 --> 40:07.616
Let's go, Rangers.
