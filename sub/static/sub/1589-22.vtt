WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.691
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.767
We need to open it.
I can't look.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.768
Mona's body
might actually
be in there.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.458
Nervous _
about something?

00:11.510 --> 00:13.330
Mona \_/anderwaal
retained me
to handle her affairs

00:13.380 --> 00:14.779
in the event
of her demise.

00:14.810 --> 00:17.108
I was instructed to wait
30 days after her death,

00:17.150 --> 00:18.572
then deliver this
to you personally.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.373
You might need
to get a doctor
to look at this.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.082
Spencer,
I have to tell you the truth

00:25.120 --> 00:26.212
before it's too late.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.613
You must be Spencer.
I'm Colin.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.615
Wren and Melissa's
flatmate.

00:28.660 --> 00:29.627
Welcome to London.

00:29.660 --> 00:30.627
Why are you so sure

00:30.660 --> 00:31.820
that Alison isn't "A"?

00:31.860 --> 00:33.396
Cyrus told me
that "A" had him get

00:33.430 --> 00:34.590
Alison out of town
that day.

00:34.630 --> 00:35.654
Cyrus, what happened?

00:38.100 --> 00:39.692
Carjack?
It's Varjak.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.389
Cyrus wasn't trying
to tell us
what happened.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.408
He was trying
to tell us
who did it.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.702
You know I'm gonna
have to tell my lavwers
about Mike?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.401
Ali,
please don't do that.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.600
His testimony
might be
the only thing

00:47.640 --> 00:48.800
that can save me.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.409
Veronica reviewed
your case
and agrees with me.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.680
It's not a good idea
for you to take the stand.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.086
How is telling the truth
not a good idea?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.281
Because you don't have anyone
to back up your story.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.479
I told you,

01:03.530 --> 01:05.657
Cyrus Petrillo
asked me to meet him

01:05.690 --> 01:07.089
at the time
of the murder.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.427
He set me up.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.224
You also told the police
he kidnapped you.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.760
And if you admit
that lie,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.530
no jury will believe
anything else you say.

01:18.710 --> 01:20.075
There's someone else...

01:22.410 --> 01:26.244
...that can testify
that I was set up.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.542
VVho?

01:30.850 --> 01:32.659
Does this person
know for a fact

01:32.690 --> 01:35.181
where you were
at the time
of the murder?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.778
No, but he--

01:36.830 --> 01:38.752
Well, then no matter
how compelling
their testimony is,

01:38.790 --> 01:41.258
they won't be able
to corroborate
your story.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.360
So what,
I'm just supposed
to sit here

01:44.400 --> 01:45.822
and pray that you can
poke holes

01:45.870 --> 01:47.531
in the prosecution's theory?

01:47.570 --> 01:49.538
There is another option.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.232
The D.A. is offering
a plea bargain.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.877
What does that mean?

01:54.910 --> 01:57.140
It means that
if you plead guilty

01:57.180 --> 01:58.909
and you take
responsibility
for your actions--

01:58.950 --> 02:01.771
Wait.
They want me to admit
to killing Mona?

02:01.820 --> 02:03.344
Yes.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.312
And they want you
to name the person

02:05.350 --> 02:06.317
that helped you
do it.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.316
Well,
thatsinsane.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.386
If you do both,
they'll give you
15 years.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.352
You could be out in 10
with good behavior.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.164
That's never gonna happen.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.599
Alison,
this is a big decision.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.564
You need to talk it over
with your father.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.639
There's nothing to talk about,
because I did not kill Mona.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.673
I'm not advocating
you take this,

02:26.710 --> 02:28.701
I just need you
to understand

02:28.740 --> 02:31.641
that the evidence
against you
is substantial.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.568
If we go to trial,

02:33.620 --> 02:36.339
the chances of you
getting acquitted
are not good.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.187
And if you're
found guilty,

02:38.220 --> 02:42.589
the prosecution
will be seeking
life without parole.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.450
The police are already
building a case

02:44.490 --> 02:46.526
against the person
they believe helped you.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.399
Who's that?

02:52.500 --> 02:53.660
Hanna Marin.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.375
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:01.410 --> 03:03.844
* Swear this one you'll save

03:03.880 --> 03:06.440
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:06.480 --> 03:08.914
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:08.950 --> 03:10.941
* IfI show you, then I know

03:10.990 --> 03:13.879
* You won't tell what I said

03:13.920 --> 03:16.480
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:16.530 --> 03:18.725
* If one of them is dead

03:24.270 --> 03:25.294
Hi.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.637
Hey.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.274
What's going on?

03:32.310 --> 03:33.709
Ithought
you weren't leaving
till Thursday?

03:33.740 --> 03:35.503
No, I'm sticking
with my original plan.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.848
I'm going back today.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.519
I barely even
got a chance
to see you.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.415
Besides, didn't Mom
change your flight
last night?

03:41.450 --> 03:42.849
Yeah, I'm changing it back.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.482
Spencer,

03:44.520 --> 03:46.750
Mom went out of her way
to track down her friend

03:46.790 --> 03:48.382
who works at St. Andrews.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.956
It wasn't easy
getting you
that interview.

03:49.990 --> 03:51.924
I don't want to go
on another interview.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.928
Yesterday was
embarrassing enough.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.428
It's not like you
to run away.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.926
The Spencer I know
would stay and nail it

03:57.970 --> 03:59.835
just to prove a point.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.337
Okay,
I'm not running away.
This just isn't

04:01.370 --> 04:02.337
a good time
for me to be here.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.962
Why?

04:04.010 --> 04:07.832
Because there's a lot going on
with my friends and...

04:09.780 --> 04:11.577
...Toby.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.846
What's going on
with Toby?

04:17.890 --> 04:19.380
I don't know.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.456
We're not really
talking right now.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.395
He became a cop
to try to protect me.

04:29.430 --> 04:33.264
And now his job is
ruining our relationship.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.700
Sounds like being here
is what you need.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.732
Sometimes relationships
run their course.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.704
But you can't see it
until you have
a little distance.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.214
It's not...
it's not just
about Toby.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.819
You know what
the best part
about living here

04:55.860 --> 04:57.487
has been for me?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.557
Getting a fresh start.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.023
Away from all
the Rosewood drama.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.391
Yeah, that must
be nice.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.738
This could be
your future, too.

05:08.770 --> 05:11.762
Don't miss out_
on the opportunity.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.747
Hanna says Alison

05:21.780 --> 05:22.986
doesn't know anyone
named Varjak.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.510
And you believe that?

05:24.550 --> 05:26.882
Why would she lie?
Her life is on the line.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.581
Yeah, so is Mike's.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.349
We need
to talk to Cyrus.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.119
If Varjak paid him
to set up Ali,

05:32.160 --> 05:33.696
then Varjak knows
who "A" is--

05:33.730 --> 05:35.425
Well, I called the hospital
this morning.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.394
And the nurse said Cyrus
had a setback.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.692
He's in the ICU.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.760
Maybe Mike
should tell the cops
what he knows.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.539
Then he winds up
in jail with Ali.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.629
Better than in the ICU
with Cyrus.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.806
Well, I'm not letting
either of those things

05:47.840 --> 05:48.875
happen to my brother.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.471
Maybe Ezra can help us.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.408
But he did do a lot of
research for his book.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.645
Maybe he came across
that name at some point.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.385
( bell rings )

06:09.700 --> 06:12.931
_ So I take it
Melissa conVInced you
to stay?

06:12.970 --> 06:14.835
Yeah, well,

06:14.870 --> 06:18.169
she can be
very persuasrve.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.678
Well, St. Andrews
is a wicked school.

06:20.710 --> 06:21.836
You'll love it.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.745
And Kate found
her prince there.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.873
So who knows,
maybe you will, too.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.674
Well,
a girl can dream.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.413
So listen,
I have an extra ticket

06:32.460 --> 06:33.609
to the theater tonight.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.810
My mate dropped out
this morning.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.929
Care to go with me?

06:36.960 --> 06:39.656
Oh, I would love to,

06:39.700 --> 06:42.021
but I should probably
stay in and prep
for my interview.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.096
Oh, yeah, yeah,
no, of course.

06:44.130 --> 06:47.463
It's just that
Melissa mentioned
you liked Shakespeare, so...

06:47.500 --> 06:49.468
I don't like Shakespeare.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.909
I love Shakespeare.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.829
They're doing Hamlet
at the RSC.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.835
Seriously?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.700
Oh, my gosh,

06:56.750 --> 06:57.774
seeing a play
at the Royal
Shakespeare Company

06:57.810 --> 06:59.209
is on my bucket list.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.673
I didn't know
18-year-olds
had bucket lists.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.915
Is that an American thing?

07:03.950 --> 07:05.042
No, it's a Hastings thing.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.614
I've had mine
smce I was SIX.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.911
And Hamlet is
my favorite.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.656
Well, then.
It must be fate.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.123
Okay.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.128
Yeah, I can prep
for my interview tomorrow.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.151
But I would like
to pay for my ticket.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.758
That's not necessary.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.030
But if you'd really like
to thank me,

07:20.070 --> 07:22.664
you can buy me
a pint after.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.734
We'll leave at seven.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.977
VERONICA: I wanted you
to hear this from me,

07:31.010 --> 07:32.477
but if anyone asks,

07:32.520 --> 07:34.078
this conversation
didn't happen.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.769
ASHLEY: Okay.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.084
Is Hanna in school?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.610
No.
She's up in her room.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.911
She has study hall
first period.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.478
Alison's been offered
a plea bargain.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.159
Part of the deal is_
to name her accomplice.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.988
I spoke to a friend of
mine in the D.A.'s office.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.564
They think it's Hanna.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.909
ASHLEY: Hanna?!

07:56.940 --> 08:00.774
No, never in a million years
would she hurt Mona.

08:00.810 --> 08:02.209
I'm not saying
that she did.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.969
But the police
have evidence.

08:04.010 --> 08:04.999
What evidence?

08:05.050 --> 08:06.870
I don't know all of it.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.172
But I heard
that Tanner found
what she thought

08:09.220 --> 08:12.519
were the remains of a body
in a barrel of acid.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.982
_The barrel was
In a storage unit.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.817
And Tanner saw Hanna

08:15.860 --> 08:17.919
outside the unit
that same day.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.053
Yesterday,
tests were confirmed

08:20.100 --> 08:22.921
that there were
bone fragments
in the acid.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.790
They were too small
to get any DNA,

08:24.830 --> 08:26.889
but Tanner believes
It's Mona's.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.604
That's horrible...

08:34.310 --> 08:36.301
I'm sure there's _
a reasonable explanatIon

08:36.340 --> 08:37.898
for why Hanna was there.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.317
One that has nothing to do
with Mona or Alison.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.784
Hanna doesn't
even speak to AlIson.

08:45.290 --> 08:49.249
Han_na_v_isited Alison
In jaII, tWIce.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.149
Look, I know
this isn't
easy to hear,

08:55.200 --> 08:56.792
but you have to
prepare yourself

08:56.830 --> 08:58.297
in case Alison
takes the plea.

09:00.870 --> 09:04.704
I can certainly recommend
an excellent defense attorney.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.149
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

09:12.180 --> 09:13.943
Alison's not gonna
take the plea.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.278
She's innocent,
and she knows Mona
planned thIs scheme.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.117
Well, it's not
gonna be easy
to prove.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.617
Look, even if she
does take the plea,

09:19.660 --> 09:20.854
she won't name you
as her helper.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.289
She wouldn't sink
that low.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.719
Well, I want
to believe that,
but we all know

09:23.760 --> 09:24.920
that All looks out
for herself first.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.188
And I'm the easy target!

09:29.100 --> 09:30.727
I'll go to the jail
and talk to her.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.123
No, I'll go.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.138
Maybe if she sees me,
it'll make it harder

09:34.170 --> 09:35.137
for her to ruin my life.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.762
Hanna, you can't go.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.038
You'll just be giving
Tanner more ammo.

09:38.070 --> 09:41.107
( phone ringing )

09:41.140 --> 09:42.949
What'd Jason say?

09:42.980 --> 09:44.379
Well, her dad's
with her right now,

09:44.410 --> 09:46.002
but she's not taking
any other visitors.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.642
Why would she do that?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.114
Because she doesn't
wanna face us.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.640
You guys, Jason said that
her lawyer got her so rattled

09:51.690 --> 09:53.851
about the trial...

09:53.890 --> 09:55.653
...she's considering
taking the plea.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.728
I'm gonna call Spencer.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.067
No, if you tell her
about the plea,

10:07.100 --> 10:08.362
she'll either
bomb her interview,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.129
or she'll skip it
and come home.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.398
Do you seriously want
to be responsible for her

10:11.440 --> 10:12.771
not getting
into St. Andrews?

10:12.810 --> 10:14.175
No, but she'll kill us

10:14.210 --> 10:15.677
if we don't tell her
what's going on.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.143
I know, but,
let's just hold off

10:17.180 --> 10:18.943
until we know
somethIng more.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.072
Fine.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.940
But we should
go talk to Ezra.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.686
If he has_
any InformatIon
on Varjak,

10:23.720 --> 10:24.982
we need to know.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.419
Yeah, but I--
I can't right now.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.883
I have a history test
in a few minutes,

10:27.920 --> 10:29.057
And if I don't get
my grade in,

10:29.090 --> 10:30.318
I might lose
my spot at Savannah.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.164
"Good luck on your test.
Hope your ankle's better.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.792
Dinner tonight?"

10:40.840 --> 10:42.091
Andrew.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.028
Yeah, Andrew Campbell.

10:46.140 --> 10:48.005
Is there something
going on between you two?

10:49.380 --> 10:50.802
He's helping me study.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.249
Yeah.
Besides that.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.077
No.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.214
So then why
is he asking you
to dinner?

10:57.250 --> 10:58.239
And why
are you blushing?

10:58.290 --> 11:00.053
Fine.
We kissed.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.079
You happy?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.985
You kissed him?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.783
Em, do not look
at me like that.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.354
What? He helped me
with my ankle
last night.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.924
He was comforting me.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.019
And I just kinda got
caught up in the moment.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.895
What about Ezra?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.828
I don't know
what's going on
with us.

11:15.870 --> 11:16.837
And I can't think
about that right now.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.337
( bell rings )

11:18.370 --> 11:20.008
So you go talk to him.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.928
And I'll meet up with you
after the test.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.004
Okay.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.888
Tanner saw
both of us there.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.387
After she takes me down,
she can go after you, too,

11:32.420 --> 11:33.887
And it'll be my fault--

11:33.920 --> 11:35.319
Hanna, calm down.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.952
L-look, as far as we know,

11:36.990 --> 11:39.481
all Tanner has on you
is her suspicion.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.395
If she had
enough evidence
to arrest you,

11:41.430 --> 11:43.728
she would've
done it already.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.499
Wait, so you're saying
if Ali doesn't take the plea,

11:45.530 --> 11:48.363
this whole nightmare
can go away?

11:48.400 --> 11:49.936
We have to find out

11:49.970 --> 11:51.164
what _other evidence
the po|Ice have on you.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.268
How?

11:52.310 --> 11:54.039
By talking to Toby.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.900
But we've already been
down that road with Toby.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.373
He's not gonna
tell us anything.

11:57.410 --> 11:59.503
I'm not giving him
a choice this time.

11:59.550 --> 12:00.847
( knocking on door)

12:10.930 --> 12:13.421
You need _to come home
WIth me.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.189
I never came across
the name Varjak

12:15.230 --> 12:16.424
in any of my research.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.928
Are you sure Alison
didn't know him?

12:18.970 --> 12:22.133
Hanna found
that "Holly Varjak" passport
in her attic.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.229
Yeah, Ali said
all that stuff
was planted.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.238
Everything
the lavwer gave us
was a set-up.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.237
By Mona?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.531
We don't know.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.468
I mean,
it could've been
Mona or "A".

12:33.450 --> 12:35.042
Are you sure
you've never seen
his name

12:35.080 --> 12:37.310
in any of your research?

12:37.350 --> 12:39.238
Can you please
go back and take a look?

12:39.290 --> 12:41.281
Emily,
I would remember
that name.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.551
No, I know, it's just,
I promised Hanna
I'd help her.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.558
And finding Varjak
is our only hope.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.353
We have nothing else
to go on.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.958
I mean Ali and Hanna
could be convicted.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.422
And I could_be next.
Or ArIa.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.358
Mona's lawyer,
do you remember
his name?

12:56.940 --> 12:59.033
Um, yeah,
James Neilan.
Why?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.435
Mona was working
for "A" at the time.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.005
And I bet Ne_ilan
was In on It.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.810
I--I packed so fast,
I'm either gonna look like

13:08.850 --> 13:11.080
I'm going
to my interview
or running a 10k.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.419
Neither will do
for a night out
on the town.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.518
Here.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.221
How's this?

13:17.260 --> 13:19.421
It's great.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.121
Thank you.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.560
Isn't that what sisters
are supposed to do?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.421
Share clothes
and makeup tips.

13:29.270 --> 13:31.033
I don't know.
We never did.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.974
It's my fault.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.433
I never should've
held on to that secret
for so long.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.040
Why did you?

13:41.980 --> 13:44.187
At first I was
protectIng you.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.350
Then I was
protecting myself.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.964
How do you get
over something like that?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.132
You don't.

14:02.470 --> 14:04.961
I think about it
every day.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.175
I don't know
if I could've done it,

14:13.220 --> 14:14.619
if the roles were reversed.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.448
You never know
what you're capable of

14:17.490 --> 14:20.914
unﬁlyouTe
in the situation.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.078
Doing something wrong
can seem like
the right thing

14:25.130 --> 14:27.291
when you're
trying to help
someone you love.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.498
Well, I'm hoping
we can start over.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.430
I'd like that.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.331
Okay.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.041
But if it's gonna work,

14:44.080 --> 14:45.968
there can_be
no more |Ies
between us.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.240
Sounds refreshing.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.079
Okay, now,
before you consider
franchising,

14:55.120 --> 14:57.452
I suggest you open
a second location
In thI area.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.650
That way,
you can oversee it.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.123
Build up the brand.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.388
Makes sense
to do that first.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.159
And if
that location's
successful,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.088
franchising would be
the next step.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.189
Do you have
specific questions

15:07.240 --> 15:09.060
about how we structure
our deals?

15:09.100 --> 15:11.432
No, actually,
I have a few questions

15:11.470 --> 15:13.279
about Mona Vanderwaal.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.403
_She was
a c|Ient of yours,
correct?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.338
Why are you asking?

15:19.380 --> 15:21.473
What I'm wondering is
why she hired you
to deliver

15:21.520 --> 15:23.340
a package in the event
of her death.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.119
You're not
an estate lawyer.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.388
What is this meeting
really about?

15:29.420 --> 15:31.058
Did she hire you?

15:31.090 --> 15:33.320
Or did someone pay you
to lie and say that she did?

15:34.300 --> 15:35.653
We're done here.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.292
An innocent girl
is accused of murder.

15:37.330 --> 15:38.467
And I think the person

15:38.500 --> 15:40.365
who really hired you
killed Mona.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.198
And if you just
tell me who that is,

15:43.240 --> 15:44.559
you will save
someone's life.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.500
I suggest you leave
before I call security.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.051
Mr. Neilan, you can tell me
or you can tell the police.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.121
Hey, sorry, I got here
as fast as I could.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.058
Ezra's just in there
talking to Neilan.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.637
Y-you okay?

16:16.670 --> 16:18.206
Yeah! Yeah.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.731
I just haven't seen
Ezra in a while.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.532
I just don't want
things to be weird.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.241
I'm sure it'll be fine.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.312
Hi.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.442
Hi.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.055
Um, so what
did he tell you?

16:37.090 --> 16:39.126
He wouldn't
tell me anything.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.048
Guys, look.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.037
He's sure in a rush.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.408
Hey, are you guys
coming or not?

17:05.150 --> 17:06.219
( indistinct guard orders )

17:11.630 --> 17:13.222
GUARD ( on P.A. ):
A|| inmates,

17:13.260 --> 17:14.659
report to your cells
for inspection.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.340
You're not going anywhere
until I get some answers.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.755
I already told you,

17:40.790 --> 17:42.712
I had nothing to do
with Mona's murder.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.284
And I said
I believe you.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.321
But you're not
making it easy for me.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.850
Why won't you tell me
what you were doing

17:47.900 --> 17:49.356
at that storage unit?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.322
Because once you know,
you can't un-know.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.497
This isn't a debate.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.134
You don't have a choice.
You need to tell me now.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.802
Hanna!

17:59.840 --> 18:03.503
Okay, I--I went there
to move everything
out of the unit.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.244
Ithought
Mona's bloody clothes
would be there,

18:08.280 --> 18:09.440
maybe her body.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.208
I thought you just said

18:13.260 --> 18:14.113
you had nothing
to do with her death.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.616
I didn't.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.720
But someone put my name
on the storage unit's lease.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.320
And they rented it the day
before Mona was murdered.

18:22.930 --> 18:25.262
Who would do that?

18:25.300 --> 18:26.267
Alison?

18:26.300 --> 18:27.335
No.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.398
Someone is framing her.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.476
And now that same person
is trying to frame me.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.279
Thank you.

18:42.750 --> 18:46.641
That was my first time
buying beer legally.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.487
This country
does have its perks.

18:49.590 --> 18:50.557
To Hamlet.

18:50.590 --> 18:51.818
To revenge.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.419
What'd you think?

18:58.470 --> 19:01.837
Ithought
that the sets were
really Impresswe.

19:01.870 --> 19:02.894
The sets.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.202
Mm-hmm.
Right.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.935
So critical to any

19:05.970 --> 19:07.733
stellar Shakespearean
production.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.609
The lighting
was really good.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.174
Another aspect
typically overlooked

19:15.220 --> 19:16.847
by most audiences.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.279
You didn't like it.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.811
No, I didn't.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.226
I really wanted to,
though. I did.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.488
It's just that
I'm such a purist

19:24.530 --> 19:25.952
when it comes
to Shakespeare,

19:25.990 --> 19:27.355
that seeing it set
in present-day London--

19:27.400 --> 19:28.628
Wasn't your cup of tea.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.594
No. I mean,
it was bad enough

19:30.630 --> 19:32.598
that we had to see Hamlet
In jeans and a T-shIrt.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.564
But did he really have
to have a cell phone?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.295
And_ whose _
genIus Idea was It

19:36.340 --> 19:38.205
to have Claudius
send Hamlet a text?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.504
That would be
the director's.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.269
Who happens
to be my brother.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.609
You're joking, right?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.845
Very much so.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.711
( laughter )

19:49.750 --> 19:51.809
I thought it was
total rubbish, too.

19:51.850 --> 19:54.318
But I'm clearly
much more polite
than you are.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.384
Yeah.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.922
There was one thing
that got me thinking.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.895
What if Hamlet
had made it
to England safely?

20:04.930 --> 20:07.933
Do you think
he could've started over?

20:07.970 --> 20:11.360
You know,
left all that...
darkness behind

20:11.410 --> 20:14.277
and created
a new life
for himself?

20:16.980 --> 20:18.800
Well, I don't
know about Hamlet.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.474
But I believe you can.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.442
( cheers and clapping )

20:27.460 --> 20:28.586
You wanna play a game?

20:28.620 --> 20:29.882
I put our names
down on the list

20:29.920 --> 20:31.387
while you were
getting the pints.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.523
Oh, looks like
we're next.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.149
Nice.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.036
Caleb and I were gonna
move the barrel
out of the bin,

20:42.070 --> 20:45.665
but before we could do it,
Tanner and Toby showed up.

20:47.510 --> 20:48.909
Why didn't you
tell me about this

20:48.940 --> 20:50.976
before you and Caleb
went there?

20:51.010 --> 20:52.978
I didn't want
to drag you
into my mess.

20:53.010 --> 20:57.947
Hanna, I'm your mother.
It's my job to protect you.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.582
I'm sorry.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.322
You understand
how serIous thIs Is,
right?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.486
Yes.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.867
Do you have any idea
who is doing this to you?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.767
I thought it was Alison.
But it's not.

21:18.840 --> 21:19.909
I don't know who it is.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.573
Bullseye!

21:25.610 --> 21:28.477
Oh, that means I won.
Loser buys next round.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.012
Ooh, actually,
that was just shy
of a bullseye.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.039
But good effort.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.318
What?

21:36.490 --> 21:38.958
Melissa did mention
you were competItIve.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.390
So I guess we have
that in common, too.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.359
What else did she mention?

21:46.400 --> 21:50.063
She said you were bright,
driven, loved literature,

21:50.100 --> 21:52.967
the theater,
everything in the arts,
really.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.015
Can I ask you a question?

22:02.380 --> 22:05.042
Yeah.
Yeah, go on.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.317
Did you really have
those Hamlet tickets?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.927
Or did you buy them
this morning?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.796
No, no,
I had them.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.831
But ifI had known

22:23.870 --> 22:28.807
what a lover
of Shakespeare
you were...

22:28.840 --> 22:30.478
...I would've
gotten them for you.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.519
You're up.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.535
EMILY: He's going in.

23:06.110 --> 23:09.409
Well, whoever lives here
really wants
to keep people out.

23:13.660 --> 23:14.684
( phone beeps )

23:20.060 --> 23:21.129
Who's Andrew?

23:22.560 --> 23:23.891
Guys, we gotta go.

23:40.650 --> 23:41.969
I thought you guys
were behind me.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.942
Okay, uh,
just stay right there.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.810
I'm gonna try
to find another way
onto the property.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.011
Oh, looks like this fence
goes around the whole place.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.449
Look, why don't I just
take a look around?

23:50.490 --> 23:52.026
No, Emily,
we're not letting you go
in there by yourself.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.096
I'll be fine.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.496
Emily, you have no idea
who's in those woods
or that house.

23:56.530 --> 23:58.225
By the time that you guys
find a way to get in here,

23:58.270 --> 23:59.623
Neilan could be gone.

23:59.670 --> 24:00.967
He came here
for a reason.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.898
Don't we want
to know what it is?

24:06.240 --> 24:07.468
Okay, come on.

24:23.690 --> 24:24.725
( door locking )

24:35.600 --> 24:36.897
( door locking )

24:36.940 --> 24:38.237
( clattering )

24:42.640 --> 24:44.005
Hello?

24:49.950 --> 24:51.542
( clattering )

25:02.200 --> 25:03.667
( screaming )

25:10.710 --> 25:11.904
Yeah, I'm going in now.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.202
What's the combination?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.071
He's been
helping me study.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.771
Andrew.

25:16.810 --> 25:17.970
That's why
he was so excited
to hear

25:18.010 --> 25:19.648
I did so well
on the test.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.113
Well, it's good to hear
that he's supporting you.

25:21.150 --> 25:22.640
Well,
I got to keep
my grades up,

25:22.680 --> 25:23.908
if I want to keep
my spot at SCAD.

25:23.950 --> 25:25.019
Emily mentioned that.
Congratulations.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.642
Thank you.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.079
I was surprised
you didn't tell me
yourself.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.588
Ezra, I meant to.
It's just been
a crazy week.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.552
It's good to hear
you're not avoiding me.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.124
No.
Why would I be?

25:37.330 --> 25:38.820
You know what?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.292
It's probably best
if we split up.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.936
We'll just cover
more territory
that way.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.164
Call me if you
find a way in.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.108
REBECCA:
Hi, Alison.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.821
Rebecca.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.748
Are you okay?

26:07.160 --> 26:10.129
If I agree to what you
mentioned earlier,

26:11.870 --> 26:13.633
can you promise me
that they'll move me

26:13.670 --> 26:15.331
to somewhere safer
than this?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.228
( laughter )

26:19.270 --> 26:21.101
The one time I don't carry
an umbrella with me.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.971
The forecast
didn't say rain.

26:23.010 --> 26:24.375
This is London.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.173
We have clouds
perpetually hoverIng
over us.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.349
Right,
how about a drink
to warm up?

26:28.380 --> 26:30.348
I make a brilliant
hot toddy.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.850
Um, I should probably
just stick with water,

26:33.890 --> 26:35.152
and call it a night.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.885
I'm still kind of
jet-lagged.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.090
Right, I'll, uh,
I'll let you
get some sleep.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.364
Colin, I had
a really great time
tonight.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.765
Thank you.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.633
So did I.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.706
Actually,
it was the best night
I've had in a long time.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.999
Yeah. Me, too.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.738
It's a shame
you're leaVIng
so soon.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.979
London won't be
the same
WIthout you.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.340
When the guard said
that my lavwer was here,

27:32.380 --> 27:34.439
I just assumed
that it was Rebecca.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.209
Is it true?

27:36.250 --> 27:38.047
You're taking the deal?

27:38.090 --> 27:40.718
Well, if the D.A.
gives me what I want.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.751
I don't understand.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.087
Yesterday
you were so adamant

27:44.130 --> 27:45.984
about wanting
to tell the truth.

27:46.030 --> 27:48.123
Things change.

27:55.770 --> 27:56.839
Look”.

28:00.410 --> 28:04.198
I can't imagine how horrible
it must be for you, in here,

28:04.250 --> 28:07.845
but taking the plea
is not the answer.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.211
Rebecca says
that a jury won't
believe me

28:09.250 --> 28:11.081
if I take the stand.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.985
And that I have
too much evidence
agaInst me.

28:13.020 --> 28:14.783
If I go to trial,
I will lose.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.378
You don't know
that for sure.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.457
Would you be willing
to take that risk?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.991
I admit, you have
a difficult case.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.863
And I understand
why you're tempted
to take the plea.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.458
But if Hanna is innocent,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.434
and you name her
as your accomplice,

28:30.470 --> 28:32.836
you'll have to live
with that terrible lie

28:32.870 --> 28:34.929
for the rest of your life.

28:56.130 --> 28:57.154
( loud thud )

29:00.570 --> 29:02.060
( knocking on door)

29:04.370 --> 29:05.769
51:23:

29:05.810 --> 29:07.266
Is your mom here?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.039
No, she's in town
meeting with a lavwer.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.138
Why?

29:12.350 --> 29:13.840
Caleb, what's wrong?

29:15.820 --> 29:17.310
I just got
off the phone
with Toby.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.284
And?

29:19.320 --> 29:21.356
Did he tell you
what evidence
they have against me?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.057
No. He didn't.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.257
But he wanted me
to know that a judge

29:28.300 --> 29:30.188
just issued a warrant
for your arrest.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.362
Alison took the plea.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.539
I guess so.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.231
How could she
do this to me?

29:40.270 --> 29:42.875
She must've panicked.

29:42.910 --> 29:43.899
I've got
to get out of here.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.076
Where are you gonna go?

29:45.110 --> 29:46.475
I don't know.
Aanhere but here.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.444
No, Hanna,
you cannot run, okay?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.414
They'll find you.
And it will only
make things worse.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.145
How can it get worse?

29:52.190 --> 29:54.408
I'm going to be arrested
for something I didn't do.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.109
And there's no way out.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.084
Yes.
Yes, there is.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.529
You can tell
Tanner about "A".

30:00.560 --> 30:02.027
I can't do that.

30:02.060 --> 30:04.392
That is who's
doing this to you.

30:04.430 --> 30:05.499
Not Alison.

30:05.530 --> 30:06.963
"A" will retaliate.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.458
"A" already has.
Over and over again.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.138
It's time to put
a stop to it.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.309
This isn't a decision
I can make on my own, okay?

30:14.340 --> 30:17.400
_ This affects _
ArIa, Spencer, and Emly
just as much as me.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.374
Okay, well,
you don't have time
to discuss it with them.

30:19.410 --> 30:22.516
Caleb, ifI tell Tanner,
everything unravels.

30:22.550 --> 30:24.609
All of our secrets,
all the lies we've told.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.880
The time we were
in New York, Shana, Aria.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.387
Okay, well,
yourfnends
will understand.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.251
And if they don't?

30:30.290 --> 30:34.397
I'll be screwing them,
just like Alison screwed me.

30:34.430 --> 30:37.456
Hanna, the cops are probably
already on their way here.

30:39.670 --> 30:43.561
Look, I understand
that doing this
will change everything.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.865
For you, for us,
for everybody.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.269
But I don't see
what choice you have.

30:58.350 --> 31:02.354
( combination lock clicking )

31:11.670 --> 31:12.967
( clattering )

32:01.520 --> 32:04.944
Hey, you can do this.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.310
What if Tanner
doesn't believe me?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.488
You have all of those threats
from "A" on your phone.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.020
She's gonna believe you.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.358
You ready?

32:26.410 --> 32:27.604
Yeah.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.448
What do you need to talk
to Lt. Tanner about?

32:38.120 --> 32:40.714
Someone's framing me
and Alison DiLaurentis

32:40.750 --> 32:42.650
for Mona Vanderwaal's murder.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.248
And I can prove it.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.021
What's your name?

32:48.060 --> 32:50.028
Hanna Marin.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.465
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.372
( beeping )

33:10.580 --> 33:12.013
Somebody hacked
into your phone.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.312
They're wiping it clean.

33:13.350 --> 33:14.419
What?

33:17.520 --> 33:18.748
Tanner will see you.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.057
Just you.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.431
I circled
the entire property.

33:29.470 --> 33:31.267
There is no way
over that security fence.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.069
Okay, I'm calling Emily.

33:47.450 --> 33:48.781
( phone buzzing )

34:06.370 --> 34:07.507
She's not picking up.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.030
( gate opens )

34:21.520 --> 34:23.078
Em!

34:24.430 --> 34:26.125
God, you scared
the crap out of us!

34:26.160 --> 34:27.354
Why weren't you
answering your phone?

34:27.390 --> 34:28.789
That's Varjak's house.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.593
Wait, so Neilan is Varjak?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.769
No, but he's
working for him.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.824
( phone beeps )

34:35.200 --> 34:36.235
Oh, my God.

34:36.270 --> 34:37.259
What?

34:37.300 --> 34:39.268
Hanna's been arrested.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.611
What do you mean,
arrested?

34:51.650 --> 34:53.379
Where's Hanna now?

34:53.420 --> 34:56.753
( camera clicking )

34:56.790 --> 34:58.428
You guys have
to show Tanner
all of the pictures

34:58.460 --> 34:59.859
and texts on your phones.

34:59.890 --> 35:00.857
If you do,
shethave
no ch0Ice

35:00.890 --> 35:02.892
but to believe Hanna.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.420
We should wait
for Spencer to get back
tomorrow morning.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.619
( phone beeps )

35:09.440 --> 35:12.637
"Let's all start
with a clean slate. - A"

35:12.670 --> 35:16.276
Guys, all the texts
"A" sent me are gone.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.675
Mine, too.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.270
So we have nothing
to help Hanna.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.217
Uh, there is
something.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.546
I found this receipt
at Varjak's house.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.455
It doesn't just have
his name on it.

35:29.490 --> 35:30.718
_ It also has
hIs phone number.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.728
So, either Varjak
is "All.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.523
Or Varjak is working
for 'A".

35:35.730 --> 35:36.890
This could help Hanna.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.935
Hanna's lavwer will do his
best to get her out on bail.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.200
But it might
not be possible.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.708
They can't keep her locked up
just because Alison said

35:47.740 --> 35:49.378
she's her accomplice.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.469
That's not why
Hanna was arrested.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.671
Alison hasn't
taken the plea yet.

35:53.710 --> 35:56.816
Then why?

35:56.850 --> 36:00.388
Tanner found the clothes Mona
was wearing the day she died.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.714
And Hanna's blood
was on them.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.961
Hey.
Where are you going?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.261
Home.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.229
Why?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.736
Hanna was arrested.

36:23.780 --> 36:25.475
Arrested?
For what?

36:25.510 --> 36:26.875
They think she had something
to do with Mona's murder.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.343
But she didn't.

36:28.380 --> 36:29.677
Have you
talked to Mom?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.278
No, I--I don't want
to wake her.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.412
I'm just gonna call
from the airport.

36:32.450 --> 36:33.542
Hey, uh, look,
Spencer,

36:33.590 --> 36:34.887
I understand
that you're upset,

36:34.920 --> 36:36.558
and I get
that you want
to help Hanna,

36:36.590 --> 36:38.683
but I think it's better
that you stay here.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.755
I can't stay here.
I have to be there
for her.

36:40.790 --> 36:41.791
What can you do?

36:41.830 --> 36:43.422
I don't know yet.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.688
Look, I want to reschedule
the interview.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.561
What's Mom's
friend's number?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.329
I don't--
I don't know.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.691
Mom said that you were
coordinating the details.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.004
Not exactly.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.974
Okay, so who is?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.905
_ The interview
Isn't completely set up.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.702
Completely?

37:02.550 --> 37:03.949
Mom--

37:03.980 --> 37:06.448
Mom doesn't have a friend
at St. Andrews.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.809
But Wren's been calling
everyone he knows.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.410
And he's trying his best
to get you in there.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.927
Wait a minute.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.518
I'm sorry.
Let me get this
straight.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.620
You and Mom pretended
that I had an interview?

37:18.670 --> 37:21.969
Mom found out that Alison
was offered a plea bargain.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.934
Part of the deal _
was to name her accompIIce.

37:23.970 --> 37:25.403
We were afraid
she might name you.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.964
So you lied
to keep me here?

37:27.010 --> 37:28.705
To keep you safe.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.402
Melissa, we just had
a conversation about this!

37:31.450 --> 37:33.543
We agreed
that we wouldn't have
any more IIes between us!

37:33.580 --> 37:35.309
I was trying
to protect you!

37:35.350 --> 37:36.510
Okay, well,
the last time
you did that,

37:36.550 --> 37:37.812
somebody got killed!

37:37.850 --> 37:39.943
( phone ringing )

37:42.960 --> 37:44.325
Hi.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.827
Yeah,
I'll be right down.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.418
Thank you.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.893
It's my cab.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.961
I was trying to help.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.695
You're not.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.685
( phone ringing )

38:25.700 --> 38:26.997
Hey.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.429
Hey.

38:28.470 --> 38:29.437
Thanks for
meeting me here.

38:29.470 --> 38:31.358
Yeah, of course.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.731
I, uh, I brought you a muffin.
I can't promise it's any good.

38:33.770 --> 38:34.930
'Cause I'm trying out
this new chef.

38:38.550 --> 38:42.941
Um, so did you figure out
when you'll be able
to see Hanna?

38:42.980 --> 38:44.618
Not for a few days.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.709
She still has to be
fully processed first.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.456
Yeah.

38:48.490 --> 38:49.957
And I couldn't
sleep at all last night.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.857
Just thinking about
how scared she must be,

38:52.890 --> 38:53.879
all alone in there.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.955
Hanna's really strong.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.353
I think she's gonna be okay

38:57.400 --> 38:58.628
till her mom
gets her out on bail.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.092
If she gets her out.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.062
Look, Ezra, uh...

39:06.070 --> 39:07.435
...yesterday
you had asked me

39:07.470 --> 39:08.801
if I'd been
avoiding you--

39:08.840 --> 39:09.807
Look, we don't have
to talk about this now.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.104
I need to.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.448
Seeing you made me
realize that.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.010
The truth is,
I have been.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.654
Because I know that,

39:21.690 --> 39:23.055
once I say
what I'm about
to say,

39:23.090 --> 39:24.819
I know that there's
no taking it back.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.689
You were right.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.760
I--I did miss out
on a lot of high school

39:34.800 --> 39:36.665
because of our relationship.

39:36.700 --> 39:40.807
And although
I don't regret any of it,

39:43.580 --> 39:46.799
I think that
when I go away to college,
I should be single.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.146
Yeah, that's the
right choice, Aria.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.451
But if we're going to end it,
I think we should do it now.

40:00.990 --> 40:04.619
The past few weeks
have been so difficult,

40:04.670 --> 40:06.661
not knowing where we stood.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.191
And it's gonna get
so much harder
if we're just

40:09.240 --> 40:11.936
counting down the days
till you go.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.131
Yeah.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.949
It's just...

40:20.750 --> 40:22.445
I cannot imagine
my life without you.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.447
Oh, I know.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.539
You don't have to.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.818
I want you in mine, too.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.685
We'll figure something out.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.066
GUARD: Open the gate!
Clear!

40:48.210 --> 40:51.429
( catcalls and whistling )

41:06.660 --> 41:12.223
* I know what
you're domg here *

41:12.270 --> 41:18.095
* Made your intentions clear

41:18.140 --> 41:24.648
* Oh, you, you terrible thing,
you terrible thing,

41:24.680 --> 41:27.569
* You beautiful thing!

41:30.080 --> 41:31.980
Good news.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.840
The D.A. is willing
to let you serve
your sentence

41:33.890 --> 41:36.688
in a minimum-security prison
in Pennsylvania.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.921
I spoke to your father
this morning.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.497
_ He feels_ _
It's your deCISlon
to make.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.563
That's the deal.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.704
Take your time.
Read it over.

41:51.740 --> 41:54.129
If you have any questions,
I'll be right here.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.133
After you've signed it,
we'll schedule an appointment

41:58.180 --> 42:00.671
for this afternoon,
so you can meet
with the D.A.

42:00.710 --> 42:02.814
and tell him the name
of your accompIIce.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.587
I've changed my mind.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.183
I'm not taking the plea.
