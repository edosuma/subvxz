Hello.

00:15.252 --> 00:19.555
I am Thunderpig!
You ate my father with lettuce

00:19.590 --> 00:24.727
and tomato on a wheat roll.
Prepare to die.

00:24.762 --> 00:26.201
What are you talking about?

00:26.237 --> 00:28.461
I am talking about vengeance,

00:28.497 --> 00:33.553
sizzling strips of juicy,
succulent vengeance.

01:08.796 --> 01:11.429
I didn't eat your Dad.

01:11.465 --> 01:17.606
And, for the record, I prefer
turkey bacon.

01:20.641 --> 01:24.077
I don't have any beef with you.

01:41.332 --> 01:45.434
Tennyson!

01:46.170 --> 01:48.338
Mr. Bowman!
It's not my fault.

01:48.373 --> 01:50.857
This pig showed up out of nowhere,

01:50.858 --> 01:53.342
and he said I ate his
father, and then he...

01:53.378 --> 01:56.914
Let's stay positive.

It's always you!

<i>Hey, Mr. Bowman!</i>

02:55.191 --> 02:56.958
Can I
help you, young man?

02:56.993 --> 02:59.460
Doubt it. My name is Ben.
I'm your new neighbor.

02:59.496 --> 03:02.497
My mom and dad just moved in
next door. Whoa, is this your car?

03:02.532 --> 03:04.866
Don't touch it!
It's a classic '67.

03:04.902 --> 03:08.603
Yeah, yeah, it's old.
Got it, gotcha.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.008
Don't you have anything
better you could be doing?

03:13.043 --> 03:17.246
Me? Nah.
I got nothing but time.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.082
You missed a spot.
- Where?

03:20.118 --> 03:22.752
Right here.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.724
I don't see anything.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.993
Oh!
- See ya!

03:41.602 --> 03:46.506
Well, if it isn't Dr. Animo and
one giant mutant mosquito.

03:46.541 --> 03:50.143
Just one? You really ought
to think this stuff through.

04:17.404 --> 04:19.574
<i> See ya!</i>

04:33.787 --> 04:38.155
Tennyson!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:39.258 --> 04:48.064
Come on, melt.

04:50.468 --> 04:55.672
But, Mr. Bowman, I've spent half
my life working off the damage.

04:55.707 --> 05:00.777
You should have thought
of that before you came near my car.

05:00.812 --> 05:03.613
Until it's paid off, you're
going to make deliveries for me.

05:03.649 --> 05:06.683
No sweat. I can use
my aliens and be done in ...

05:06.718 --> 05:09.987
No alien powers,
no alien anything!

05:10.022 --> 05:15.260
This is going to be
work, hard work, not fun.

05:16.595 --> 05:22.466
You're going to learn responsibility
if it kills you, starting now.

05:22.501 --> 05:25.269
<i>Tube socks.
Get your tube socks.</i>

05:25.304 --> 05:28.872
<i>Now in chocolate,
vanilla, and new-car smell.</i>

05:32.478 --> 05:34.445
Uh, delivery from Mr. Bowman.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.234
<i>Did you wreck his car again?</i>

05:39.235 --> 05:41.988
It wasn't my fault.

<i>That poor biped.</i>

♪ Pakmar, Pakmar ♪

05:55.101 --> 05:58.769
Tennyson, what are you doing
here in Pakmar's new place?

05:58.804 --> 06:01.038
Delivery.
Where do you want these?

06:01.073 --> 06:04.708
No!
- Not here?

06:04.743 --> 06:08.845
Then where? Over here?
- No! Stop!

06:08.881 --> 06:11.681
Stop where?
- Get out!

06:11.717 --> 06:14.017
But you have to sign for it.

06:14.053 --> 06:15.986
Get out!

06:30.270 --> 06:32.170
Were you expecting a package?

06:32.205 --> 06:36.742
Yes. Something
ferocious, something...

06:36.777 --> 06:39.145
deadly.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.386
Oh.
Then I guess this one is yours.

07:02.369 --> 07:05.804
I didn't invite you here to socialize.

07:05.839 --> 07:10.308
I've invited you here to share
in an opportunity,

07:10.344 --> 07:14.879
an opportunity to bid on
auctions for unique objects and

07:14.915 --> 07:20.259
one-of-a-kind curios,
like this next lot right here ...

07:20.260 --> 07:22.992
A date with the lovely Fistina.

07:22.993 --> 07:25.724
<i>As informed bidders know,</i>

07:25.759 --> 07:29.394
<i>Fistina does not come
onto the market very often.</i>

07:29.430 --> 07:33.098
<i>Shall I start the bidding at one Tayden?</i>

07:34.502 --> 07:36.068
<i>One Tayden.
Do I hear one Tayden?</i>

07:36.104 --> 07:36.669
<i>One Tayden here?</i>

07:42.077 --> 07:47.013
<i>Oh, no. I actually
didn't bring any money.</i>

07:53.353 --> 07:55.588
<i>Sold!</i>

08:11.606 --> 08:15.592
Yes. Now for what you've
all been waiting for ...

08:15.593 --> 08:23.950
the PiÃ¨ce de résistance,
a Dwarf Star.

08:23.985 --> 08:31.891
You know how rare this is.
Serious bidders only.

08:31.927 --> 08:35.129
Compacted into a special container,

08:35.130 --> 08:38.332
it can supercharge any
device in the galaxy.

08:38.366 --> 08:42.135
A regular engine
becomes a super engine.

08:42.171 --> 08:45.907
A regular weapon
becomes a super weapon.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.776
What's my opening bid for ... huh?

08:48.811 --> 08:51.179
Goldfish?

08:51.214 --> 08:53.381
I had a pen here just a
second ago.

08:53.416 --> 08:57.552
You wouldn't happen to have
one I could borrow, would you?

09:06.929 --> 09:10.164
That fool courier brought
the wrong bag. I ...

09:10.199 --> 09:11.498
Wait.
Wait a minute.

09:11.534 --> 09:14.301
If the bags got switched,
the label ... yes.

09:14.337 --> 09:19.673
The label should tell me the
delivery person who has my Dwarf Star.

09:19.709 --> 09:25.112
Tenny... Tennyson?
Ben Tennyson?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.481
You know what this
means, boys?

09:27.517 --> 09:30.135
Whoever gets that Dwarf Star from Ben 10

09:30.136 --> 09:34.422
will get it and will get it for free.
- Those rats!

09:34.457 --> 09:38.493
I have to get that Dwarf Star
back before they get it.

09:38.528 --> 09:41.329
I won't get my money!

09:41.365 --> 09:48.070
<i>Apartment 70f, apartment 7f0,
apartment 7-smiley-face-0.</i>

09:48.105 --> 09:50.672
Where's apartment 7?

09:50.708 --> 09:52.908
There he is.

09:52.943 --> 09:58.780
Maybe someone
here can help me out.

09:58.816 --> 10:00.015
Hey!
Get back here!

10:00.050 --> 10:02.651
If I lose these deliveries,
Mr. Bowman is never gonna ...

10:03.754 --> 10:04.219
Zombozo?

10:04.255 --> 10:08.457
Keep running.
We're not here to fight.

10:14.999 --> 10:18.668
Zombozo,
Trombipulor, and Fistrick?

10:18.703 --> 10:22.172
Ben Tennyson.
Funny seeing you here.

10:22.207 --> 10:24.908
Nah, it's not that funny.
Get him!

10:28.047 --> 10:32.550
You teamed up
just so you could steal packages?

10:33.585 --> 10:37.521
Don't judge me.
It's tough out there being a clown.

10:40.860 --> 10:45.062
Get off of me, peanut breath.

10:47.967 --> 10:52.336
Step right up.
Hit the target and win a prize.

11:00.946 --> 11:04.349
Whoa!

11:09.756 --> 11:15.526
Now, don't distract me.
This requires my utmost concentration.

11:25.004 --> 11:30.375
You've been a great audience.
Drive home safely.

11:44.758 --> 11:48.128
Oh, well.
Gah!

11:50.034 --> 11:51.967
That was weird.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.440
<i>- Are you finished?
- I have a question.</i>

11:57.476 --> 12:00.544
Is there any reason people would
want to steal your packages?

12:00.579 --> 12:03.280
<i>What?
Did you lose your deliveries?</i>

12:03.315 --> 12:05.949
No, no, nothing like
that, but some guys tried to ...

12:05.985 --> 12:07.618
<i>Then hurry up and finish.</i>

12:07.653 --> 12:09.453
I have to walk this
stuff everywhere.

12:09.488 --> 12:12.089
You know, I could go a lot faster
if you let me drive your truck.

12:12.124 --> 12:17.796
May I remind you of what
happened to the last truck you touched?

12:18.831 --> 12:20.231
That was years ago.

12:20.266 --> 12:22.867
<i>No more excuses.
Finish your job!</i>

12:22.902 --> 12:25.102
Okay, okay.
Stop yelling at me.

12:25.137 --> 12:27.104
I'm almost done.
I'll see you soon.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.506
That man has issues.

12:29.542 --> 12:33.244
Last delivery ... a couple of goldfish.

12:45.824 --> 12:49.762
What the ...
the Kraaho?

12:51.797 --> 12:57.335
Come on, you're stealing goldfish?
Mr. Bowman's gonna kill me.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.805
I'll buy you your own fish.
Just give me those ba...

13:03.443 --> 13:06.511
Seebik, does Ester
know what you're doing?

13:06.546 --> 13:11.749
Oh, I hope not.
Warriors, blast him!

13:18.357 --> 13:22.926
<i>Seebik, your warriors
could use some more practice.</i>

13:22.962 --> 13:28.065
<i>Practice makes perfect.
Like this.</i>

13:36.808 --> 13:39.008
<i> Get back here!</i>

13:40.878 --> 13:46.719
<i>Seebik!
Give me back my goldfish!</i>

13:53.425 --> 13:58.561
Zombozo, Trombipular,
Fistrick, now Seebik and the Kraaho?

13:58.597 --> 14:00.263
Too much of a coincidence.

14:00.299 --> 14:03.066
But why are they trying
to steal goldfish?

14:03.101 --> 14:10.473
Unless it's not goldfish.
- It's not.

14:10.509 --> 14:13.243
Psyphon, didn't know you
were into goldfish.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.312
Don't play dumb with me.

14:15.347 --> 14:20.150
It's a Dwarf Star in a containment
sphere, and it belongs to me.

14:20.185 --> 14:23.520
Hand it over.
- Are you gonna make me?

14:23.556 --> 14:27.126
<i>Oh, no, I'm not.
They are.</i>

14:41.169 --> 14:44.537
You may have been
able to beat us one at a time,

14:44.572 --> 14:48.640
but you won't be able
to do it all at once.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.361
There is no escape, Tennyson.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.965
Give me my Dwarf Star now!

15:02.000 --> 15:05.402
Where's my goldfish?
- What?

15:08.107 --> 15:11.542
My goldfish.
If this bag has your star, then

15:11.577 --> 15:13.978
you have the bag with my goldfish.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.514
Then, a trade.

15:16.550 --> 15:21.186
I give you your fish,
you give me my Dwarf Star.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.490
Deal.
- What do you mean, "deal"?

15:25.526 --> 15:28.127
I mean deal.
Take your Dwarf Star.

15:28.162 --> 15:31.730
I just want the goldfish so
Mr. Bowman will get off my back.

15:31.766 --> 15:36.570
Why? You're
holding a rare Dwarf Star,

15:36.571 --> 15:41.374
the ultimate power, but you're
willing to give it up so easily?

15:41.409 --> 15:44.810
What's so special about these goldfish?

15:44.846 --> 15:48.180
Ultimate power?
Okay, new deal.

15:48.216 --> 15:51.417
I keep this, you give me the
Goldfish, and I don't wipe the

15:51.452 --> 15:54.153
walls with the lot of you.
- Get him!

15:57.090 --> 16:01.259
Okay, then, no deal!

16:08.168 --> 16:11.250
Hey, Trombipular and Tummy Head,

16:11.251 --> 16:14.874
let me ask you a
question, and be honest.

16:15.909 --> 16:18.013
Does this hurt?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.849
I'll take that as a yes.

16:30.358 --> 16:32.692
Slide tackle!

16:38.266 --> 16:42.069
Don't think so.

16:42.104 --> 16:46.840
<i>Get out of here!</i>

16:46.876 --> 16:52.112
Sweet. I got some good
distance on that one.

16:57.551 --> 17:01.687
Back, Tennyson, back.

17:01.723 --> 17:06.425
Ah, this brings me back to my
days working in a school lunchroom.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.710
Next!

17:31.852 --> 17:38.358
The battle's not going well.
Time to bring out the heavy artillery.

17:49.371 --> 17:53.173
You know, you could have
just given me the fish.

17:53.208 --> 17:56.075
Fish? Fish?

17:56.110 --> 18:00.702
Fool.
This is a Dwarf Star!

18:00.737 --> 18:05.584
You have no idea how powerful this is.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.459
Allow me to demonstrate.

18:22.001 --> 18:26.870
Such power.
The only downside is that now

18:26.905 --> 18:31.210
I'll have to auction this
Dwarf Star as being slightly used,

18:31.246 --> 18:35.782
but if I destroy Ben Tennyson
with it, it'll be worth it.

18:46.226 --> 18:51.033
Impressive force field, isn't it?

19:02.009 --> 19:07.415
I'm beginning to have second thoughts
about selling this Dwarf Star.

19:12.888 --> 19:15.856
If I keep it, I could
conquer the universe...

19:15.891 --> 19:19.661
not that you'll be
alive to see it happen.

19:20.696 --> 19:25.199
Clever.
You are a sneaky one, Tennyson.

19:25.235 --> 19:27.201
Not gonna be able to
overpower him.

19:27.237 --> 19:28.702
I need a new plan of attack.

19:44.886 --> 19:49.523
What is this?
Am I supposed to be impressed?

19:57.664 --> 19:59.365
No!

20:03.269 --> 20:04.302
No!

20:04.337 --> 20:06.337
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

20:12.045 --> 20:17.284
I'll take that. And
more importantly, I'll take this.

20:23.922 --> 20:27.491
Yes! Hoo-hoo!

20:32.128 --> 20:35.264
There's the last of it.
Every last package safely delivered.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.766
Thank you, Ben.

20:36.801 --> 20:41.137
My car's been completely fixed,
and you've worked off the damage.

20:41.172 --> 20:42.538
So, we're square?

20:43.374 --> 20:46.275
Completely square...

20:46.310 --> 20:50.546
At least until the next
time you wreck my car.

20:50.581 --> 20:55.151
Don't worry, Mr. Bowman.
That's never gonna happen again.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.724
My car!

21:11.802 --> 21:15.404
I truly, truly hate you.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.175
Mr. Bowman,
I don't know what to say,

21:19.176 --> 21:22.911
but I guess the right
thing to do is... see ya!

21:24.648 --> 21:29.183
