01:41.685 --> 01:44.020

into a bidding war.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.774
Okay Jack.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.317
How did you get her?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.443
Dean hasn't exhibited for years.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.570
What did you say?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.656
Trade secrets,
Marie, trade secrets.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.158
Well perhaps you could work
your magic on your father.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.868
I'd love to know
what he's doing.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.663
Wouldn't we all?

02:06.626 --> 02:07.460
Ruth.

02:08.877 --> 02:11.464
I thought we agreed you
weren't coming tonight.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.509
I hate to tell you what a
great job you're doing here.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.263
Yeah I think we've
done pretty well.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.848
You should enjoy it.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.599
Really enjoy it.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.851
Because it's over.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.353
Sorry, what?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.024
My family is selling
the gallery, Jack.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.154
What did you think, Jack?

02:34.195 --> 02:36.448
You'll just carry on managing
the gallery indefinitely?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.783
We are divorced.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.036
At least we will be when
you sign the papers.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.289
This gallery is my home, Ruth.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.707
I've put everything into it.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.334
Everything except money.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.421
Okay.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.549
I'll buy the gallery.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.177
(chuckling) Did you
win the lottery?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.431
I could maybe sell
the old Italian house

03:02.766 --> 03:03.600
with my dad.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.019
The deserted barn no
one's allowed to mention,

03:06.061 --> 03:07.020
let alone visit?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.523
Your dad's a selfish prick

03:10.565 --> 03:12.442
who's never even
been to your gallery.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.529
He'll never sell that
place and you know it.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.700
Stick to the lottery plan, Jack.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.370

I'm on my way,
I'll be 20 minutes.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.513

Where's your stuff?

04:47.620 --> 04:48.496
I travel light.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.583
You're not packed, are you?

04:51.624 --> 04:52.625
I thought it was tomorrow.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.835
You could at least have called

04:53.877 --> 04:54.753
or left a message.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.629
Hey Robbie.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.131
Have you seen my jacket?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.007
Oh.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.426
Hi.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.095
Yeah, Jessica, this is
my son, actually, Jack.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.514
Jack, this is Jessica.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.390
Hi, Jessica.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.726
Fuck you.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.479
Jessica.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.523
Jessica.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.649
Jennifer?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.151
Jennifer, Jennifer, shit.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.195
Okay, tea.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.029
I'll make the tea.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.238
You go pack.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.825
(cars honking)

05:40.173 --> 05:42.884
Are you gonna read
the whole way there?

05:42.926 --> 05:46.012
The Dover road is famously
the most boring drive

05:46.054 --> 05:47.639
in the British Isles.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.515
Ask anyone.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.686
So you're not gonna
talk to me then.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.814
What would you
like to talk about?

05:55.855 --> 05:59.025
I don't know, the
usual father-son stuff?

06:03.863 --> 06:06.199
What are your views
on Hentai manga?

06:06.241 --> 06:08.535
Do you see it as
art or pornography?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.164
I meant like how's work.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.042
Oh, I see, an off
the peg conversation.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.753
Ah, how's work?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.172
Forget it, read your book.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.425
No, no, this is starting
to get really good.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.260
Are you eating well?

06:27.053 --> 06:30.223
Did you see the game last night?

06:30.265 --> 06:31.349
What game?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.059
You know, the one with the ball.

06:37.147 --> 06:37.981
How's Ruth?

06:40.066 --> 06:40.900
She's great.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.819
Sends you her love.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.072
Terrific.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.911
(light music)

07:04.591 --> 07:05.717
Okay, what's bugging you?

07:05.759 --> 07:06.593
Spit it out.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.887
I'm worried the house
won't be the way

07:08.928 --> 07:09.929
you remember it.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.515
Why not?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.644
You haven't been back
since you were seven.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.481
I mean the walls, for example.

07:19.522 --> 07:23.276
The walls haven't been
painted in decades.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.235
That's an easy fix.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.572
The grounds might need tending.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.949
Look, I'm not expecting Xanadu.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.952
We just cheer the place
up a bit and get it sold.

07:32.994 --> 07:33.828
Why the rush?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.831
I don't hear from
you for months,

07:36.873 --> 07:39.084
and then this sudden need
to sell the Tuscan house

07:39.125 --> 07:40.460
by last Tuesday.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.464
The house that's been
basically empty for 20 years?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.925
Look on the bright side.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.010
You'll be home on
Saturday with a big check

07:49.052 --> 07:50.762
and you can blow
your half picking up

07:50.804 --> 07:52.430
stray women in bars.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.516
Don't make assumptions
about my current lifestyle

07:54.557 --> 07:55.475
based on Jessica.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.309
Jennifer.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.185
Jennifer, fuck.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.104
Jack.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.022
My point is we
should take a moment.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.524
Look.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.694
Ruth and I decided to buy
the gallery from her parents.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.697
So yeah, that's why I
need the money, okay?

08:11.366 --> 08:13.618
(car starting)

08:13.660 --> 08:16.746
(light guitar music)

08:26.006 --> 08:28.967
(song in foreign language)

08:29.009 --> 08:31.511
Flying dinosaur, 11.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.971
Is it, I don't know,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.764
why don't you ever
drive-a-saurus?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.102
It's never 11 letters.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.204
How about a game of I spy?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.248
(Jack sighing)

09:00.290 --> 09:03.418
I spy with my little eye

09:03.460 --> 09:05.795
something beginning with Q.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.069
(crickets chirping)

09:35.825 --> 09:38.495
(keys clinking)

09:49.923 --> 09:51.007
Let me try.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.514
(banging)

10:03.937 --> 10:05.438
(door creaking)

10:05.480 --> 10:07.774
(slamming)

10:20.620 --> 10:21.621
Oh my god.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.007
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.467
Things always look
worse in the dark.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.015
What the fuck is that?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.672
I'll leave you to it.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.895
(somber music)

12:04.057 --> 12:06.226
(sighing)

12:40.260 --> 12:43.013
(birds chirping)

13:12.292 --> 13:15.128
(uplifting music)

13:21.343 --> 13:24.179
(faucet creaking)

13:25.472 --> 13:28.308
(pipes vibrating)

13:29.976 --> 13:32.312
(splashing)

13:38.902 --> 13:41.738
(Jack exclaiming)

14:03.343 --> 14:06.846
(critter snarling)
Huh!?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.436
(rattling)

14:31.871 --> 14:34.332
(Robert sighing)

14:34.374 --> 14:36.418
Pass me the knifey bit.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.142
At least the view's quite good.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.729
That's what you're calling

14:55.770 --> 14:59.524
one of the most spectacular
convergences of nature ever?

14:59.566 --> 15:00.400
The view?

15:01.276 --> 15:02.277
You haven't even looked at it.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.197
Two cypress trees
frame the compositions

15:06.239 --> 15:07.907
subconsciously
propelling the eye

15:07.949 --> 15:10.869
across the negative space
toward the focal point

15:10.910 --> 15:13.747
of the perfectly central villa,

15:13.788 --> 15:16.916
all unified by these magnificent

15:16.958 --> 15:18.626
undulating Tuscany hills.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.756
Late afternoon, remember.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.967
The way the light
hits those windows

15:26.009 --> 15:27.177
takes your breath away.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.138
No, that's the dust doing that.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.767
I mean how could you
let it go like this?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.145
(car honking)

15:37.187 --> 15:39.272
Oh an interruption,
what a shame.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.607
Must be the estate agent.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.649
Damn, she's early.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.278
We'll mark the view as a 10

15:45.320 --> 15:48.281
but the potholes down that
drive are a serious drawback.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.908
I may have whiplash.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.909
One of you is Jack?

15:50.950 --> 15:51.743
I'm Jack.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.577
Kate Lewis.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.745
Jack.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.913
Sorry, I've said that.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.747
Robert.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.748
Hello.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.125
Now, let's see
what we have here.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.172
Not perhaps the best
first impression.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.508
Things can only get better.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.759
Front door?

16:07.801 --> 16:08.635
Ah...

16:20.814 --> 16:22.315
Well I don't even
know what to say

16:22.357 --> 16:24.192
about this whole situation.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.860
Do you know Frank Swine?

16:25.902 --> 16:26.820
Should I?

16:26.861 --> 16:29.656
That is my homage to his style.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.825
You painted it?

16:34.661 --> 16:35.495
I see.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.176
(banging in distance)

16:54.347 --> 16:57.100
(toilet flushing)

17:02.022 --> 17:03.648
There's a large
hole in your roof.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.026
Yes, but it's got great bones.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.234
Don't you think Kate?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.738
Or you prefer Katie?

17:09.779 --> 17:12.240
Just Kate, plain Kate.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.116
A bonny Kate.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.827
And sometimes Kate the cursed,

17:15.868 --> 17:19.079
but Kate, the prettiest
Kate in Christendom.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.628
From the Taming of the,

17:28.048 --> 17:28.882
The shrew?

17:29.966 --> 17:30.800
By Shakespeare.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.848
Do you think we can
make a quick sale, Kate?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.350
Well that depends.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.476
On?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.394
On whether you hope
to make a profit.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.688
Tuscany is a romantic idyll.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.607
It's why all my
clients come here.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.193
If I were to bring them to
this house in this state

17:48.234 --> 17:49.194
they will say to me,

17:49.235 --> 17:52.072
"Kate, you promised me a dream.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.366
"A dream orchestrated by Puccini

17:54.407 --> 17:56.284
"in which my worries
would just float off

17:56.326 --> 17:57.869
"into the infinity pool.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.289
"But instead you have
delivered me a building site

18:01.331 --> 18:04.459
"whose walls seem to have
been painted by Mussolini."

18:06.461 --> 18:07.837
Having said all that,

18:09.172 --> 18:10.715
if you put your backs into it

18:10.757 --> 18:13.468
I don't see why you
couldn't turn this around.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.471
In the plus column, your
plumbing seems to work.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.764
People care about that.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.768
And I like, as you
say, its bones.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.279
(birds chirping)

18:33.321 --> 18:34.781
I wouldn't if I were you.

18:35.824 --> 18:36.991
It's about to rain.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.832
(thunder booming)

18:43.873 --> 18:46.793
(melancholy music)

19:15.321 --> 19:17.490
(banging)

19:20.076 --> 19:22.537
(sighing)

19:22.579 --> 19:25.331
(birds chirping)

19:34.424 --> 19:36.468
I wouldn't go on the
bathroom for a while

19:36.509 --> 19:38.011
if I were you.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.971
There's a large
weasel in the sink.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.848
That's not a euphemism.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.310
No, we'll get what we can
for the house, isn't it?

19:45.352 --> 19:49.314
It'll be fuck all.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.232
But this is
impossible on my own.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.196
Or we could keep it.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.405
Except the weasel.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.324
They're too friendly
for my liking.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.826
Listen, we are going
to sell this house

20:01.868 --> 20:03.078
one way or another.

20:03.119 --> 20:03.995
Get on board with that.

20:04.037 --> 20:04.829
Where are you going?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.206
I've got a gallery to buy.

20:07.207 --> 20:07.999
(door slamming)

20:08.041 --> 20:10.210
(revving)

20:14.631 --> 20:17.008
(phone ringing)

20:17.050 --> 20:18.343
Jack, what do you want?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.469
Ruth.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.513
I just wanted you
to know I'm in Italy

20:21.554 --> 20:24.599
and I persuaded my
dad to sell the house.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.600
So?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.894
So it means I can
buy the gallery.

20:27.936 --> 20:31.022
Sorry, you were
actually being serious.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.733
It's on the market, it's
already been in trust.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.402
You said I had a month.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.408
(melancholy guitar music)

21:08.810 --> 21:11.104
(crashing)

21:18.278 --> 21:20.655
Do you need some help
knocking the others over?

21:22.157 --> 21:24.951
(birds chirping)

21:40.133 --> 21:42.844
(chain clinking)

21:49.809 --> 21:52.312
(light music)

21:55.398 --> 21:57.609
Are you always this busy?

21:57.650 --> 21:58.902
Mondays I'm closed.

22:04.407 --> 22:05.241
So.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.162
Where did you learn
to speak English?

22:11.498 --> 22:12.707
Bugs Bunny.

22:12.749 --> 22:13.667
Huh?

22:13.708 --> 22:14.668
Bugs Bunny.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.546
In Italian schools,
kids are forced

22:18.588 --> 22:20.173
to watch cartoons
for five hours a day

22:20.215 --> 22:21.800
just to learn English.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.717
Really?

22:22.759 --> 22:23.635
Mhmm.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.552
It's the laws.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.304
I had no idea.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.014
That's actually pretty cool.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.975
Of course not.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.644
I lived in England for a year.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.646
I worked in a restaurant there.

22:34.688 --> 22:37.148
And you, you're on holiday?

22:37.190 --> 22:38.566
Oh, no, no, I wish.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.696
I'm actually here to
sell an old family house.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.239
I see, where?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.241
It's out of town towards Pienza.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.581
Oh my gosh.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.709
This is amazing.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.584
I know.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.838
Is your house near
the deserted house?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.381
It's probably the same one.

23:03.466 --> 23:04.759
With the beautiful lake?

23:05.719 --> 23:06.511
Mhmm.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.263
I love that house.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.139
Really?

23:11.391 --> 23:12.225
You wanna buy it?

23:13.351 --> 23:16.438
Well, I can only pay
you with risotto.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.231
How many bowls do
you want for it?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.028
Three should do it.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.488
And I want a nice bottle of red.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.617
You obviously don't understand

23:29.659 --> 23:30.910
how good this risotto is.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.247
Okay, fine.

23:35.081 --> 23:35.915
Two bottles.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.669
They have to be big ones.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.383
I haven't even seen what
it looks like inside.

23:45.425 --> 23:49.262
(coughing) Well, that's
the main selling point.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.226
(light music)

23:55.268 --> 23:58.396
Thank you for the
really lovely food.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.606
(Woman speaks in
foreign language)

23:59.647 --> 24:01.566
You know you're lucky
to have that house.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.901
So pretty.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.235
No.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.445
It needs a ton of work.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.907
This took me five years to fix.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.783
But now.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.534
Five years?

24:13.119 --> 24:14.829
I don't even have five weeks.

24:14.871 --> 24:15.705
Anyway.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.749
(Woman speaks in
foreign language)

24:17.791 --> 24:19.084
Jack.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.168
Natalia.

24:20.210 --> 24:24.798
(speaks in foreign
language) Natalia.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.189
(light somber music)

25:25.567 --> 25:27.694
When I first saw this house,

25:28.862 --> 25:32.073
you can't imagine
how stunning it was.

25:36.953 --> 25:37.912
I've been thinking.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.708
It deserves to have
its history honored.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.213
Well, whatever we do,
I need to do it quick.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.090
Right.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.593
Start tomorrow then?

25:53.428 --> 25:54.262
Properly?

26:14.157 --> 26:17.118
This place has not
changed at all.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.747
Good, okay.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.416
I've divided the jobs up
into the ones we can do

26:24.668 --> 26:26.419
and ones we need
professionals for.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.464
Maybe Kate will
know some workmen.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.800
What do you think?

26:33.468 --> 26:34.302
Dad?

26:37.097 --> 26:38.264
Did you ever see this film?

26:38.306 --> 26:39.724
No.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.726
I say we do the painting
ourselves, downstairs first

26:41.768 --> 26:43.436
then we hit the bedrooms.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.437
Or maybe we just,

26:46.690 --> 26:47.482
are you listening at all?

26:47.524 --> 26:49.234
I'm multitasking.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.110
Uh huh.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.362
What did I say then?

26:52.404 --> 26:54.906
You said something
fascinating about painting.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.909
Anyway, you're getting
way ahead of yourself.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.453
We've got a far bigger
problem on our hands.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.416
So?

27:04.457 --> 27:05.250
Just a minute.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.961
Okay, let me look then.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.463
It's still there.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.297
Okay, well what's the plan?

27:11.339 --> 27:12.924
Make it jump out the window.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.092
How are we supposed to do that?

27:14.134 --> 27:15.301
One, two, three, war.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.096
What?

27:18.138 --> 27:19.431
It's a classic technique, Jack.

27:19.472 --> 27:20.974
Tried and tested.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.100
One, two, three?

27:22.142 --> 27:22.976
War!

27:27.731 --> 27:28.690
Let me get this straight.

27:28.732 --> 27:29.524
You're saying we
charge the weasel

27:29.566 --> 27:31.609
and hope it commits suicide?

27:31.651 --> 27:32.485
Out the window.

27:34.487 --> 27:35.864
The window isn't even open!

27:36.823 --> 27:38.283
You have a better idea?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.492
Wiseli.
Ferret.

27:39.534 --> 27:40.869
Feratu, feratu.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.787
No, no, no (speaks in
foreign language) (growling)

27:42.829 --> 27:44.122
It's like a rat but,
It's big.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.290
Good teeth.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.332
The size of a baguette,

27:46.374 --> 27:48.460
like a rat baguette.

27:48.501 --> 27:52.672
(light music in
foreign language)

28:00.930 --> 28:01.973
Rough translation.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.016
Very doable.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.898
Again and I'm paraphrasing here.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.107
Not a problem.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.819
(men chattering)

28:14.861 --> 28:17.405
Great news, couldn't be better?

28:17.447 --> 28:19.449
You're a fast learner.

28:30.919 --> 28:34.089
(drill whirring)

28:34.130 --> 28:36.299
(rasping)

28:47.477 --> 28:50.563
(machinery whirring)

28:52.107 --> 28:54.609
(saw rasping)

29:06.746 --> 29:07.580
Dad?

29:09.749 --> 29:10.583
Dad?

29:12.085 --> 29:14.212
Do you want to take a picture
of the mural or something?

29:14.254 --> 29:15.338
Do I what?

29:15.380 --> 29:17.048
Well, we're gonna
have to paint over it.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.300
I just wondered if
you wanted a memento.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.553
You're planning on removing
one of my paintings?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.554
It's just to give the buyers

29:22.595 --> 29:24.389
half a chance of
being practical.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.557
Why?

29:25.598 --> 29:26.891
Are you expecting
them to be as blind

29:26.933 --> 29:29.310
to the beauty of
contemporary art as you?

29:29.352 --> 29:32.272
Look, obviously it's not
without artistic merit.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.898
Not without artistic merit?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.984
Is that your
professional opinion?

29:38.111 --> 29:39.154
What's that supposed to mean?

29:39.195 --> 29:42.240
Those who can, do, Jack.

29:42.282 --> 29:44.576
Those who can't run
their wife's gallery.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.119
Wait a minute!

29:46.161 --> 29:47.746
If you're so bloody can-do,

29:47.787 --> 29:49.414
where are your paintings huh?

29:49.456 --> 29:51.291
You haven't done
anything in forever.

29:51.332 --> 29:52.667
Not true.

29:52.709 --> 29:53.918
In the last five years,

29:53.960 --> 29:56.171
I've completed several
paintings actually.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.505
I'm warning you, Jack.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.758
You touch that wall and
I will not be responsible

29:59.799 --> 30:01.092
for the consequences.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.470
I will not lift another
finger around here!

30:05.472 --> 30:06.806
What's going on in there?

30:18.401 --> 30:19.235
Wow.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.405
Don't dare patronize me.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.327
The ones you finished
as good as this?

30:28.370 --> 30:29.454
They're terrible.

30:29.496 --> 30:32.374
I don't know if I'd
incinerate them.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.086
(birds chirping)

30:42.050 --> 30:44.678
No, no, I've had enough of this.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.055
We're in Italy.

30:47.097 --> 30:48.723
The least we can do
is have a decent meal.

30:50.684 --> 30:55.271
(crowd chattering
in foreign language)

31:10.036 --> 31:12.539
(light music)

31:20.046 --> 31:21.464
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

31:21.506 --> 31:22.882
(speaks in foreign language)
Now this is more like it.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.509
Tonight, they screen
a movie in the square,

31:24.551 --> 31:25.844
always very popular.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.721
But first, everyone
comes for dinner.

31:28.763 --> 31:29.556
(speaks in foreign
language) I'm Natalia.

31:29.597 --> 31:30.432
Shit.

31:30.473 --> 31:31.599
Robert, I'm honored.
Sorry.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.934
My dad.

31:32.976 --> 31:33.768
Roberto.

31:33.810 --> 31:35.895
It looks like you're full.

31:35.937 --> 31:36.896
We'll find room.

31:37.939 --> 31:40.942
(jazzy blues music)

32:00.920 --> 32:05.050
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

32:05.091 --> 32:06.134
Okay.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.053
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

32:08.094 --> 32:10.764
(guests speaks in
foreign language)

32:10.805 --> 32:13.141
Excuse my family,
they're celebrating.

32:13.183 --> 32:14.267
Oh, your family?

32:14.309 --> 32:15.727
Yes, it's my brother
in law's birthday.

32:15.769 --> 32:16.561
(man speaks in foreign language)

32:16.603 --> 32:17.645
That's my sister, Clara.

32:17.687 --> 32:18.730
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

32:18.772 --> 32:22.150
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

32:22.192 --> 32:24.444
Oh my god, this is amazing.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.991
(guests chanting in
foreign language)

32:30.033 --> 32:33.745
(guests applauding and laughing)

32:33.787 --> 32:35.246
Probably on a Tinder date.

32:35.288 --> 32:36.331
On a what?

32:36.373 --> 32:37.457
Tinder.

32:37.499 --> 32:39.250
You know what Tinder is.

32:39.292 --> 32:41.294
It's an app. You
know what an app is.

32:41.336 --> 32:43.254
Yeah, I know what a
bloody app is, Jack.

32:43.296 --> 32:45.465
Okay, well, Tinder's
a sort of dating app.

32:45.507 --> 32:46.591
On a computer?

32:46.633 --> 32:48.259
No, it's an app,
it's on your phone.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.260
On your phone?

32:49.302 --> 32:50.804
Yes, it's an app.

32:50.845 --> 32:51.930
Just stop saying it's
some fucking app.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.139
Well it is.

32:53.181 --> 32:54.307
Ugh, I despair.

32:54.349 --> 32:55.934
What happened to dancing?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.311
The well timed drink?

32:58.353 --> 33:00.605
The miracle of a
chance encounter?

33:00.647 --> 33:02.691
Well now, they've
got this algorithm

33:02.732 --> 33:05.318
that replaces chance
with probability

33:05.360 --> 33:07.946
so you're less likely
to be disappointed.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.447
Oh, bullshit.

33:09.489 --> 33:12.283
Disappointment is an
absolute certainty.

33:12.325 --> 33:15.036
Everyone lets everyone
down at some point.

33:15.078 --> 33:18.456
How you come back from
that, that's romance.

33:18.498 --> 33:19.290

33:24.921 --> 33:25.964
Roberto.

33:26.006 --> 33:26.965
Okay.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.299
Oh, are you English?

33:28.341 --> 33:29.134

foreign language)

33:29.175 --> 33:32.929
(speaks in foreign language)

33:40.729 --> 33:42.147
Marzio.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.023
Natalia.

34:38.995 --> 34:40.038
(man speaks in foreign language)

34:40.080 --> 34:40.871
Maybe so.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.540
Maybe so. (laughing)

34:42.581 --> 34:43.375
Excuse me.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.085
Natalia has told me

34:45.126 --> 34:46.835
about your (speaks
in foreign language).

34:47.754 --> 34:48.545
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

34:48.588 --> 34:50.715
I am very old but I remember

34:50.757 --> 34:53.717
the family that
owned that house.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.678
Their name was,

34:56.137 --> 34:56.971
Pazzini.

34:58.348 --> 35:00.266
That was my wife's family.

35:00.308 --> 35:01.142
You?

35:01.184 --> 35:03.395
You married the Pazzini girl?

35:03.436 --> 35:04.396
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

35:04.437 --> 35:06.147
Wonderful.

35:06.189 --> 35:10.443
(woman speaks in

35:23.873 --> 35:27.293

(speaks in foreign language)

36:09.502 --> 36:12.047
(somber music)

36:22.891 --> 36:24.726
Amazing view.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.520
Amazing view.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.943
Did you like the film?

36:36.196 --> 36:38.740
I couldn't understand any of it.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.450
And half of me is from here.

36:45.121 --> 36:46.790
I heard about your mother, Jack.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.377
I'm sorry.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.254
Yeah.

36:53.296 --> 36:55.757
I must have been able to
speak some Italian once.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.304
Can't remember anything.

37:08.895 --> 37:12.357
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

37:12.399 --> 37:13.233
You repeat.

37:22.283 --> 37:26.454
(Jack speaks in
foreign language)

37:28.832 --> 37:29.666
Amazing view.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.379
Hey, you two!

37:34.421 --> 37:36.548
This man has a
birthday to celebrate.

37:36.589 --> 37:37.882
Come on!

37:37.924 --> 37:40.176
(laughing)

(man singing in

37:57.318 --> 37:58.570
(revving)

37:58.611 --> 37:59.821
Woo!

37:59.863 --> 38:01.990
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

38:02.032 --> 38:04.242
(Luigi speaks in
foreign language)

38:04.284 --> 38:06.411
Wow, this is such a rare Vespa!

38:06.453 --> 38:08.580
Guys, who did this?!

38:08.621 --> 38:09.914
Guilty.

38:09.956 --> 38:11.750
No guilty, you are (speaks
in foreign language).

38:11.791 --> 38:12.959
Luigi.

38:13.001 --> 38:14.753
How the hell did you
get that thing going?

38:14.794 --> 38:17.422
(revving)

38:17.464 --> 38:20.508
(light bright music)

38:32.062 --> 38:36.399
(woman singing in

38:49.829 --> 38:52.040
(camera clicking)

38:52.082 --> 38:52.916
Ooh.

38:53.750 --> 38:54.918
Very dramatic.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.338
And you have all the whiskey.

39:05.595 --> 39:07.263
Who's this?

39:08.348 --> 39:10.517
That's my daughter, Anna.

39:10.558 --> 39:11.393
She's eight.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.311
And a quarter.

39:13.353 --> 39:14.521
Don't forget the quarter.

39:15.522 --> 39:19.317
She looks just like you.

39:19.359 --> 39:20.193
Here.

39:33.373 --> 39:34.374
This is?

39:35.917 --> 39:37.544
Her father.

39:37.585 --> 39:39.170
The guy from the restaurant?

39:39.212 --> 39:40.380
He's my ex-husband.

39:42.048 --> 39:43.550
I fight and win the divorce,

39:44.718 --> 39:46.386
I fight to save my baby.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.766
She's the only thing
that matters, but,

39:53.226 --> 39:54.102
I lose.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.565
Because he lied about me.

40:00.066 --> 40:01.901
So I only got her half the time

40:04.738 --> 40:06.072
and some holidays.

40:08.658 --> 40:11.911
God I'm so sorry, Natalia.

40:13.121 --> 40:14.581
We have very good holidays.

40:17.334 --> 40:20.378
(scooter revving)

40:20.420 --> 40:21.212
Natalia!

40:21.254 --> 40:22.213
Luigi!

40:22.255 --> 40:23.256
(Luigi speaks in
foreign language)

40:23.298 --> 40:24.674
This is really fun!

40:33.141 --> 40:33.933
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

40:33.975 --> 40:34.809
Hey!

40:42.776 --> 40:43.651
This is good.

40:43.693 --> 40:45.111
Nah, it's okay.
No, no, no, no.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.571
I mean, this is pretty.

40:46.613 --> 40:47.489
Thank you.
It's beautiful!

40:47.530 --> 40:48.615
Like me, ah.

40:48.656 --> 40:49.741
It's pretty wonderful.

40:49.783 --> 40:50.909
Luigi!

40:50.950 --> 40:51.785
Luigi!

40:53.370 --> 40:54.829
Wait, wait.

40:54.871 --> 40:55.955
Excuse us.

40:55.997 --> 40:56.831
Stay down.

41:01.628 --> 41:02.587
Ah, no Roberto no,
please, please.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.297
Don't move, I work fast.

41:08.677 --> 41:10.345
Have you painted many port--
Shh.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.613
Can I see it?

41:28.655 --> 41:29.989
Okay.

41:30.031 --> 41:31.658
But remember, you'll hate it.

41:32.826 --> 41:36.538
People, they're no good
at seeing themselves.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.084
Okay, I'm ready.

41:47.841 --> 41:50.093
(laughing)

41:52.053 --> 41:54.514
Once you get the eyes,
you're basically there.

41:54.556 --> 41:55.807
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

41:55.849 --> 41:58.560
Roberto, where did you
get this amazing bike?

41:59.519 --> 42:01.396
My wife found it, I think.

42:07.694 --> 42:10.030
Why do you always do that?

42:11.740 --> 42:12.657
What?

42:12.699 --> 42:14.909
If you ever referred to Mum

42:14.951 --> 42:17.579
which is practically never,

42:17.620 --> 42:22.167
why is it always my
wife, your mother?

42:22.208 --> 42:25.045
Why do you never use her name?

42:30.050 --> 42:31.885
She's called Raffaella.

42:32.719 --> 42:35.430
Yeah, okay, Raffaella.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.891
And why is that bike
all that's left of her

42:37.932 --> 42:38.933
in this whole house?

42:38.975 --> 42:41.853
I mean that's weird, isn't it?

42:41.895 --> 42:43.438
It's like she didn't exist!

42:45.774 --> 42:48.193
I think you've had too
much to drink, Jack.

42:48.234 --> 42:51.946
If you cared about her at all,

42:51.988 --> 42:54.574
why would you let
her house fall apart?

42:55.784 --> 42:58.161
Jack, we have guests.

43:01.748 --> 43:03.833
Of course, guests.

43:05.126 --> 43:08.630
Sorry I can't do the
Foster charm to order.

43:10.423 --> 43:11.591
I'll leave that to you.

43:21.643 --> 43:22.477
Jack?

43:23.770 --> 43:24.604
Wait.

43:29.442 --> 43:30.777
You know, we didn't
have one conversation

43:30.819 --> 43:32.320
about Mum after she died.

43:33.947 --> 43:34.781
Not one.

43:37.033 --> 43:39.035
He never even
mentioned her death.

43:41.121 --> 43:44.416
He just, he told
me about how I had

43:44.457 --> 43:45.792
to become a man now.

43:48.294 --> 43:49.587
Which is a fucking joke

43:49.629 --> 43:51.840
because what does he
know about being a man?

43:55.635 --> 43:57.971
I really tried to
be a man for him.

44:00.306 --> 44:02.475
I didn't cry at the funeral.

44:03.518 --> 44:04.853
I was so proud of that.

44:06.479 --> 44:07.772
I look at seven year olds now

44:07.814 --> 44:10.316
and half of them cry when
they drop an ice cream.

44:13.528 --> 44:14.654
But I didn't cry.

44:22.370 --> 44:24.164
I don't think I
know how to grieve.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.502
(somber music)

44:29.544 --> 44:34.007
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

44:46.686 --> 44:47.520
Wait.

44:51.691 --> 44:52.984
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

44:53.026 --> 44:57.364
(Marzio speaks in
foreign language)

45:13.755 --> 45:18.093
(Marzio speaks in
foreign language)

45:22.722 --> 45:24.099
Natalia?

45:24.140 --> 45:25.600
No, it's fine.

45:25.642 --> 45:27.727
I just, it's fine.

45:30.897 --> 45:33.441
(somber music)

45:40.573 --> 45:42.784
(scraping)

45:55.296 --> 45:58.717
(phone ringing)

45:58.758 --> 46:01.469
This is Ruth,
leave me a message.

46:01.511 --> 46:03.054
Ruth, it's Jack.

46:03.096 --> 46:06.474
Listen, please don't sell
the gallery to anyone else.

46:06.516 --> 46:07.809
I'm serious about buying it.

46:07.851 --> 46:09.686
Just don't do anything hasty.

46:10.770 --> 46:11.604
Please.

46:16.651 --> 46:18.820
(sighing)

46:20.697 --> 46:23.450
(birds chirping)

46:52.020 --> 46:52.812
(exclaiming)

46:52.854 --> 46:55.148
(thudding)

47:07.535 --> 47:10.538
(breathing heavily)

47:15.168 --> 47:19.839
There are some very
powerful lay lines here.

47:20.924 --> 47:21.841
Can you feel them?

47:23.510 --> 47:25.720
Tuscany is very creative.

47:26.596 --> 47:29.432
Michelangelo, Rafael, Da Vinci.

47:31.101 --> 47:32.352
Mr. Foster here.

47:33.687 --> 47:34.521
They all feel it.

47:36.523 --> 47:37.691
Of course.

47:50.704 --> 47:52.914
(sniffing)

47:58.253 --> 47:59.838
Oh god.

47:59.879 --> 48:02.173
Don't touch the counter.

48:02.215 --> 48:03.133
It's still...

48:08.555 --> 48:09.556
White spirit.

48:14.602 --> 48:16.938
Stop, you're just
making it worse.

48:18.231 --> 48:20.066
This black mark is a sign.

48:21.735 --> 48:23.903
You can see that,
can't you, Kate?

48:24.779 --> 48:29.075
You know black is for
fear, for darkness.

48:31.244 --> 48:32.996
Right across my vagina.

48:39.252 --> 48:41.838
Have you ever read
Interiors magazine?

48:42.756 --> 48:43.590
Um...

48:45.675 --> 48:46.509
I thought not.

48:48.094 --> 48:50.388
If your creativity's
reach is only as far

48:50.430 --> 48:53.725
as toping large splashes of
misery over your surfaces,

48:53.767 --> 48:56.394
may I suggest you
enlist some outside help

48:56.436 --> 48:57.812
to guide you towards something

48:57.854 --> 49:00.774
more commercially advantageous?

49:06.446 --> 49:09.199
(birds chirping)

49:10.533 --> 49:12.619
(car revving)

49:12.660 --> 49:14.412
You know, I looked you up.

49:14.454 --> 49:16.122
I Googled you.

49:16.164 --> 49:17.082
Robert Foster.

49:17.123 --> 49:19.250
You were so good and successful

49:19.292 --> 49:21.294
and then poof, you disappeared.

49:22.545 --> 49:25.215
Well, I'm very flattered
you looked me up.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.844
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

49:29.886 --> 49:32.138
You did such an amazing
job with the interior

49:32.180 --> 49:33.139
of your restaurant.

49:34.391 --> 49:36.101
I was wondering if you
could give us some hints

49:36.142 --> 49:37.811
about decorating our house.

49:38.978 --> 49:40.522
Are you serious?

49:40.563 --> 49:42.232
I know exactly
what we should do.

49:48.238 --> 49:51.032
But I've been wanting
to ask you something.

49:51.074 --> 49:52.659
Why are you selling it?

49:52.701 --> 49:53.952
Jack is.

49:53.993 --> 49:55.370
Jack owns the house?

49:55.412 --> 49:56.371
We own half each.

49:57.539 --> 50:00.166
But Jack's memories
of the house are

50:00.208 --> 50:01.209
maybe not so good.

50:02.419 --> 50:04.337
That's why I sent him
to boarding school.

50:05.922 --> 50:07.382
You sent him away from you?

50:13.221 --> 50:14.055
I just,

50:15.181 --> 50:16.683
I didn't want him surrounded by

50:16.725 --> 50:19.519
reminders of his
mother, like me.

50:21.521 --> 50:24.149
And it's harder
when you can't ask

50:24.190 --> 50:25.567
your best friend what to do.

50:28.778 --> 50:30.822
You know, he was
actually happy here once.

50:30.864 --> 50:33.324
I made him this swing
down by the lake.

50:33.366 --> 50:36.494
Just an old tire and a rope.

50:36.536 --> 50:37.954
God, he loved that thing.

50:43.209 --> 50:44.127
I have an idea.

50:45.295 --> 50:47.505
Why don't you
drive us into town?

50:47.547 --> 50:48.423
It's a really fun car.

50:48.465 --> 50:49.507
I don't drive.

50:49.549 --> 50:51.051
I just don't.

50:54.304 --> 50:58.558
After what happened, because
of the circumstances,

51:02.270 --> 51:03.563
I couldn't drive Jack.

51:06.399 --> 51:08.651
I couldn't drive
and couldn't paint.

51:20.288 --> 51:21.748
(grinder whirring)

51:21.790 --> 51:22.624
Oy!

51:23.500 --> 51:24.417
Oy!

51:24.459 --> 51:26.252
We've got guests.

51:26.294 --> 51:28.463
I've called in the cavalry.

51:28.505 --> 51:29.297
New color scheme.

51:29.339 --> 51:30.799
It's gonna look amazing!

51:33.760 --> 51:38.765
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

51:38.807 --> 51:39.641
Hi.

51:45.438 --> 51:47.232
(speaks in foreign language)

51:47.273 --> 51:48.566
(speaks in foreign language)

51:48.608 --> 51:51.903
(speaks in foreign language)

51:51.945 --> 51:53.613
She says your hair is all white.

51:57.117 --> 51:58.910
(Natalia laughing)

51:58.952 --> 51:59.994
Anna likes painting.

52:01.037 --> 52:01.955
Elephants mainly.

52:03.498 --> 52:05.959
(cute music)

52:21.307 --> 52:22.142
Anna!

52:23.810 --> 52:24.644
Anna!

52:27.063 --> 52:29.941
Anna (speaks in
foreign language)

52:29.983 --> 52:31.151
Look at you both.

52:31.192 --> 52:32.485
This is terrible.

52:36.823 --> 52:38.783
(laughing)

52:38.825 --> 52:42.996
Ana (speaks in foreign language)

52:43.038 --> 52:44.789
We have to thank you.

52:44.831 --> 52:46.124
You should be our
first dinner guest

52:46.166 --> 52:47.459
when we finish painting.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.002
Tomorrow night.

52:49.044 --> 52:50.628
Tomorrow night?

52:50.670 --> 52:53.131
It's just a bit of paint, Jack.

52:53.173 --> 52:55.175
No one ever wants
to cook for a cook.

52:56.051 --> 52:59.637
I know my way around
a sun kissed tomato.

52:59.679 --> 53:02.515
Never doubt an artist
when he wants to create.

53:02.557 --> 53:03.725
(speaks in foreign language)
And then you can tell me

53:03.767 --> 53:05.894
the end of your
mountain climbing story.

53:06.853 --> 53:07.896
(speaks in foreign language)

53:07.937 --> 53:11.816
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

53:11.858 --> 53:14.402
I know my way around
a sun kissed tomato?

53:15.528 --> 53:16.321
What?

53:16.363 --> 53:18.239
You can't even boil an egg.

53:18.281 --> 53:20.325
And what's this mountain
climbing bullshit?

53:20.367 --> 53:22.452
Well I went on a very
good walk near Chamonix.

53:23.411 --> 53:24.537
No, seriously.

53:24.579 --> 53:26.373
It took all afternoon.

53:26.414 --> 53:27.749
Right, you lazy ass.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.918
Come on, time waits for no man.

53:29.959 --> 53:32.879
Idle hands and all
that, chop chop.

53:33.922 --> 53:36.716
(birds chirping)

53:47.310 --> 53:50.397
(door chime dinging)

54:00.949 --> 54:02.033
(shopkeeper speaks
in foreign language)

54:02.075 --> 54:03.201
Hi.

54:03.243 --> 54:04.869
Do you speak English?

54:04.911 --> 54:05.745
(speaks in foreign
language) a little.

54:05.787 --> 54:06.871
Okay, great.

54:06.913 --> 54:09.082
So I need to cook a meal

54:09.124 --> 54:10.625
and it's for this
pretty amazing girl

54:10.667 --> 54:12.043
and she's a really good cook

54:12.085 --> 54:13.712
so I need to make
something great

54:13.753 --> 54:14.921
and I can't cook.

54:16.965 --> 54:19.718
I have a son too, I understand.

54:19.759 --> 54:20.677
Don't worry.

54:27.851 --> 54:28.810
Where have you been?

54:28.852 --> 54:30.770
She's gonna be
here in 30 minutes.

54:30.812 --> 54:32.731
What are you gonna
do about food?

54:32.772 --> 54:34.315
I can't give her
cheese on toast.

54:34.357 --> 54:35.942
She's a bloody chef!

54:35.984 --> 54:37.569
Keep your hair on.

54:37.610 --> 54:40.280
The woman at the deli said
this ragu's restaurant quality

54:40.321 --> 54:42.282
made specifically for her shop.

54:45.201 --> 54:49.539
(operatic song in
foreign language)

56:10.203 --> 56:11.705
(speaks in foreign language)

56:11.746 --> 56:14.541
Pff.
Pssh. (chuckling)

56:14.582 --> 56:16.376
But what's your secret?

56:17.794 --> 56:19.129
How did you do the onions?

56:23.049 --> 56:23.842
The onions?

56:23.883 --> 56:25.260
Mhmm.

56:25.301 --> 56:26.761
That's a very good question.

56:26.803 --> 56:29.806
I always think, the
secret with onions is to,

56:33.226 --> 56:34.853
I'm not good with
those cheffy terms

56:34.894 --> 56:36.396
you hear on TV.

56:36.438 --> 56:38.231
Jack, what do you call it?

56:40.066 --> 56:41.192
Oh, the--

56:41.234 --> 56:42.694
It's on the tip of my tongue.

56:42.736 --> 56:43.945
Stirring.

56:43.987 --> 56:44.863
No.

56:44.904 --> 56:45.697
Reduction.

56:45.739 --> 56:46.531
Reduction.

56:46.573 --> 56:47.365
Yeah.

56:47.407 --> 56:48.199
Yes.

56:48.241 --> 56:50.535
That's the one we reduce.

56:50.577 --> 56:52.037
And you have to stir it a lot.

56:52.078 --> 56:52.871
You're dead without
the stirring.

56:52.912 --> 56:54.205
There's a technique.

56:54.247 --> 56:56.291
Clockwise, anti-clockwise.

56:56.332 --> 56:59.919
Simmering and stirring
and reduction.

56:59.961 --> 57:02.380
It's an old family recipe.

57:02.422 --> 57:04.424
Oh, it's your family recipe?

57:09.596 --> 57:10.430
Well...

57:11.598 --> 57:13.975
Maybe more like the recipe of

57:15.101 --> 57:17.228
the lady who runs the shop

57:17.270 --> 57:19.105
that I bought it from.

57:19.147 --> 57:19.981
Right.

57:22.317 --> 57:24.319
You've tasted this ragu before?

57:26.696 --> 57:29.866
I make it for her. (laughing)

57:36.289 --> 57:38.249
(Jack chuckling)

57:38.291 --> 57:39.626
Oh God.

57:39.668 --> 57:42.629
(crickets chirping)

57:44.297 --> 57:45.965
It's so peaceful here.

57:47.133 --> 57:48.635
This lake's the only
thing I remember

57:48.677 --> 57:49.511
about this plac.e

57:51.971 --> 57:54.349
There used to be this old
swing just over there.

57:56.226 --> 57:57.310
Over there?

57:59.145 --> 58:01.147
Your father told me about it,

58:01.189 --> 58:02.649
how he made it for you.

58:02.691 --> 58:04.025
Oh he didn't make it.

58:04.067 --> 58:06.528
I think it was just there.

58:06.569 --> 58:08.029
Well, until it broke.

58:13.868 --> 58:14.703
This swing?

58:17.664 --> 58:19.499
How the hell?

58:24.170 --> 58:25.005
I dare you.

58:26.172 --> 58:26.965
What?

58:27.007 --> 58:29.843
Ha, you're scared.

58:29.884 --> 58:31.344
I'm not scared.

58:33.847 --> 58:36.599
Do you want, you're daring
me to swing on this?

58:39.853 --> 58:40.645
Whoah!

58:40.687 --> 58:43.481
(splashing)

58:43.523 --> 58:44.315
Jack?

58:44.357 --> 58:45.191
Okay.

58:45.233 --> 58:50.155
Jack, are you okay? (laughing)

58:50.196 --> 58:53.324
Oh you laughing at me, huh?

58:53.366 --> 58:54.409
Here, give me a hand up.

58:54.451 --> 58:55.493
No, no!

58:55.535 --> 58:58.246
(splashing)

58:58.288 --> 59:00.874
(light music)

59:04.210 --> 59:06.421
(laughing)

01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:07.607
I was in agony.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.027
My life had just been destroyed.

01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:18.535
I needed to do
something with the pain.

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.212
I just moved to Italy.

01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:32.590
My husband told me for years

01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:33.800
he didn't want children

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.137
until it was too late for me.

01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:45.061
Then he got his
secretary pregnant.

01:00:49.315 --> 01:00:52.027
So I upped the stakes and
started again out here.

01:00:55.488 --> 01:00:59.200
Except, you never
really can start again.

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:02.996
No.

01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:05.498
You can't.

01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:10.795
Well, Mr. Foster.

01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:12.088
Robert, come on.

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:13.840
Robert.

01:01:15.842 --> 01:01:17.260
I salute you.

01:01:17.302 --> 01:01:19.888
I suspect we're going to
make a comfortable sale here.

01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:23.683
Bravo.

01:01:29.272 --> 01:01:30.190
Great bones.

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:35.779
(birds chirping)

01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:43.078
(electronic dance music)

01:01:47.123 --> 01:01:49.918
(man sighing)

01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:52.796
(camera clicking)

01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:56.966
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:01:57.008 --> 01:01:58.718
This is ticking a
lot of boxes for me.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.720
Talk me through the
plumbing situation.

01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:02.722
It works.

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:05.600
Pipes in these, too
much can be a bitch.

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:06.851
Southwest facing, huh?

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.061
It is.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.270
And the pool gets the
light all day long.

01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:10.980
Let's check out these acoustics.

01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:14.734
(vocalizing)

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.616
Yeah, let's do it.

01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:22.450
Do what?

01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:24.244
I love it, I love it.

01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:26.037
Shouldn't we at least
look at the other places?

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.706
Yeah see, that's why I love you.

01:02:27.747 --> 01:02:29.541
You keep me grounded.

01:02:29.582 --> 01:02:31.626
How many more
places on the list?

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.045
Um, three, I believe.

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:37.382
Let's crack on then.
(speaks in foreign language)

01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.592
(revving)

01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:44.431
What a dick.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.976
Still, it looks like
you have a sale.

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:55.942
Did you change your mind?

01:02:58.194 --> 01:02:59.446
No, I need to sell it.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.284
Why?

01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:06.995
Well.

01:03:09.205 --> 01:03:10.373
I should have told you.

01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:17.464
I'm getting a divorce.

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.185
We've been separated
for a while.

01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:33.855
She's taken everything.

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.025
(somber music)

01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:38.401
I know how that feels.

01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.991
I managed her parent's
art gallery for her.

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.077
That's how we met.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:49.913
And we were just too young to

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.874
you know?

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:56.336
I was really good at that job.

01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.174
And now they're
selling the place so

01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:04.678
I'm gonna use the
money to buy it back.

01:04:06.179 --> 01:04:10.809
It's just, I can't follow
in Dad's footsteps.

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:15.855
You know, he's so charming
and easy and talented.

01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:19.192
I can't paint like him.

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:24.614
But I can make real
success out of the gallery.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.544
You want to impress
him, of course.

01:04:44.217 --> 01:04:46.052
He never even came
to the gallery.

01:04:49.389 --> 01:04:50.557
He thinks I'm a failure.

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:54.644
Really?

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:57.063
Did you ask him?

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:42.984
(door creaking)

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:19.896
(somber music)

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:07.921
My whole childhood's
in this room.

01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.426
I wanted to tell you, but--

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:14.302
But what?

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:19.683
I was afraid of how

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.434
you would take it.

01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:25.270
It's like you literally
locked up all of my memories.

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.654
Yes, I think that's
exactly what I did.

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:34.531
I...

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:43.122
tried to find the fastest way
for you to be out of pain.

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:50.005
You never let me in.

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.135
You never fucking let me in!

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.764
You never talked to me!

01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:00.765
Why?

01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:03.600
Why do you never talk to me?!

01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:05.937
Why do you hide this from me?

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:06.770
No!
Jack.

01:09:06.813 --> 01:09:07.814
Get off me!
Jack.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:09.774
Get your hands off me!

01:09:09.816 --> 01:09:10.649
No, no.

01:09:12.986 --> 01:09:13.819
No.

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:24.080
I'm sorry.

01:09:37.844 --> 01:09:40.180
She had very elegant wrists.

01:09:41.221 --> 01:09:42.182
Do you remember?

01:09:44.517 --> 01:09:45.352
No.

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:50.273
I don't remember anything.

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:57.864
When the hospital called
after the car crash,

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:03.912
there was this Italian
consultant on the line

01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:05.872
trying to explain
what had happened.

01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:10.877
But he was speaking so fast
I thought you were dead.

01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:14.214
And I thought I
had lost you both.

01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:20.387
The despair of finding out
that Raffaella was dead

01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:23.765
and the relief that you weren't,

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:28.353
you'd think that
those two emotions

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.230
couldn't exist simultaneously.

01:10:32.565 --> 01:10:37.570
But they can.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.450
Do you think about her much?

01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.994
I think about her every day.

01:10:47.914 --> 01:10:49.874
You can't remember

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:51.459
and I can't forget.

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.673
Just stopped trying in the end.

01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:04.472
Is that weird?

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:06.391
(laughing) You loved watching

01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:08.143
Italian quiz shows together.

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:11.730
Did we?

01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:15.567
It was the host's
ridiculous hair.

01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:17.694
You both thought
it was hilarious.

01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:20.655
You'd spend ages in the bath

01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:24.159
making it with
shampoo. (laughing)

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.786
She loved it when you did that.

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:35.253
I remember she was
really angry with me

01:11:35.295 --> 01:11:36.963
before we got in the car.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.092
It's almost my
only memory of her.

01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:45.680
She was shouting at me.

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:48.892
I don't know why.

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:58.902
(Robert sobbing)

01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:00.653
Dad?

01:12:01.988 --> 01:12:05.116
Oh fuck, I'm so sorry.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:05.992
What?

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.040
I was losing the light.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:15.585
What's the matter?

01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:24.719
I was supposed to
be looking after you

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:25.762
down by the lake.

01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:29.265
You were on your swing
and I was painting.

01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:33.520
The next thing I know Raffie
ran down from the house.

01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:35.730
Someone had called from town.

01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:38.483
You had walked all
the way to your school

01:12:38.525 --> 01:12:40.902
and I hadn't even
noticed you were gone.

01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:42.696
I was so wrapped up painting!

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.117
And I should have
driven to get you.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.414
But you were losing the light.

01:12:57.377 --> 01:13:00.588
I was supposed to
be in that car!

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.882
Oh God, I'm so sorry, Jack.

01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:06.886
You've lost your mother
and it's my fault!

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:13.393
(somber music)

01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:55.101
Ruth left me.

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:57.937
We're getting a divorce.

01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.486
Oh, thank God.

01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:09.282
What?

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.535
I've been pretty
sure for months, but,

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:15.205
(sighing) what a relief.

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:18.416
Wait, you knew?

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.126
What did I always tell you?

01:14:20.168 --> 01:14:21.670
Don't even think about marriage

01:14:21.711 --> 01:14:22.504
until you're

01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:23.380
at least 35.

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:28.343
We guys don't have a clue
who we are before that.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.011
Wait, how old were you and Mum

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.513
before you guys got married?

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:37.310
29, but that was a
different situation.

01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:41.898
(Jack chuckling)

01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:47.862
(bell tolling in distance)

01:14:47.904 --> 01:14:50.407
(light music)

01:15:07.173 --> 01:15:11.553
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

01:15:19.853 --> 01:15:22.522
Well, it's your lucky day.

01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:24.190
I'm going full asking.

01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:25.191
Let's close this quick though,

01:15:25.233 --> 01:15:26.484
that's my condition.

01:15:26.526 --> 01:15:27.652
Katie here says that--

01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:29.571
Kate.

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:30.739
Come again?

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.118
Her name is Kate, not Katie.

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.329
Got you, so Kate says
that works for you.

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:39.998
Job done, everyone's happy.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.833
Darling, you know
it's so musty in here.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:44.002
Let's make this wall
a glass one, shall we?

01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:45.879
Yeah, yeah that's
a great idea, babe.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.380
Obviously this
piece of shit goes.

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:48.506
Right.

01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:50.425
Looks like Mr. Angry painted it.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:53.136
(both laughing)

01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:56.723
You should know that
what I'm about to say

01:15:56.765 --> 01:16:00.101
is not just because of how
dismissive you have been

01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:02.020
of such a beautiful house

01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:04.564
or indeed my craft as a painter.

01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:07.984
Although, let's face
it, that didn't help.

01:16:09.903 --> 01:16:13.698
There is nothing musty
about this space.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.451
And it wouldn't be improved
by either a glass wall

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.994
or you living in it.

01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:20.830
Sale's off, time to go.

01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:24.209
What I'm trying to say is

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.877
get the fuck out of my house.

01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:27.253
Robert, please.

01:16:28.254 --> 01:16:29.339
Sorry.

01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.299
Get the fuck out of
my house, please.

01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:37.305
Very robust language.

01:16:40.141 --> 01:16:41.267
Extremely vigorous.

01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:43.436
Well.

01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:51.111
Fuck 'em.

01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:04.249
What just happened?

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:06.668
Well you should have
heard the prick.

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:08.086
I will not sell this house

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:10.630
to a couple of
culture thugs, Jack.

01:17:10.672 --> 01:17:13.758
That's why we're here,
to sell the house.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.344
And you're arguing the
toss over a bloody wall

01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:18.096
you'll never see again.

01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:19.180
Listen, I just thought that--

01:17:19.222 --> 01:17:20.473
You thought what?

01:17:21.307 --> 01:17:24.102
That one conversation
would change everything?

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:27.188
That I'd suddenly forget
the last 15 years?

01:17:29.524 --> 01:17:30.358
No.

01:17:33.319 --> 01:17:34.529
I can't do it, Jack.

01:17:35.488 --> 01:17:37.323
I just can't give this house up.

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:40.368
Oh my God, you never
had any intention

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:42.620
of selling this place.

01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:43.496
Did you?

01:17:54.841 --> 01:17:57.510
(door slamming)

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.517
(somber music)

01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:23.203
(sighing)

01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:58.822
(phone ringing)

01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:31.771
(phone ringing)

01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:57.172
(spoon clinking)

01:20:05.472 --> 01:20:06.848
What's this?

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:09.392
I made a quick cash
sale on my London house.

01:20:11.144 --> 01:20:12.520
It was worth a lot.

01:20:13.855 --> 01:20:16.858
Enough to buy you out
of your share in Italy.

01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:23.823
Buy your gallery back.

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:30.080
(sighing)

01:20:30.997 --> 01:20:32.248
Why did you never come?

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.877
Ruth told me you
didn't want me to.

01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:39.547
She said I'd be pressure
you didn't need.

01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:45.178
(scoffing)

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.724
Where are you gonna live?

01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:52.894
Italy, I think.

01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:57.023
I'm going to host painting
holidays, would you believe?

01:20:57.065 --> 01:20:58.900
Kate's idea, actually.

01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:06.449
Already got a bit of free
advertising on my app.

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:11.287
You only have 12 followers.

01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:13.581
Don't knock it.

01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:15.542
You know who else
had 12 followers?

01:21:17.293 --> 01:21:19.963
(Jack laughing)

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.813
Al Notti!

01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:51.578
(somber music)

01:21:58.251 --> 01:22:00.920
(hopeful music)

01:22:19.522 --> 01:22:20.482
That's great.

01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:21.316
And then if we can
add some here as well.

01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:22.233
Yeah that's fine.

01:22:22.275 --> 01:22:23.902
Now, however.

01:22:23.943 --> 01:22:25.487
Sorry, just one moment.

01:22:29.115 --> 01:22:29.949
Ruth.

01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.291
I have something for you.

01:22:39.876 --> 01:22:41.252
Look, even if you
did win the lottery,

01:22:41.294 --> 01:22:42.629
we're not selling anymore.

01:22:45.632 --> 01:22:47.592
No, I'm serious, I
won't accept any offer.

01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:48.843
You'll accept this.

01:22:57.143 --> 01:22:59.145
I should have signed
it a long time ago.

01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:11.491
Good luck with everything.

01:23:26.214 --> 01:23:29.050
(uplifting music)

01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:35.890
(birds chirping)

01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:50.780
Try for a touch more
contrast there, Susan.

01:23:51.948 --> 01:23:53.700
Maybe the banana wants to be

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:55.744
a little less green?

01:23:55.785 --> 01:23:58.455
I was aiming for
a jungly malaise.

01:24:03.918 --> 01:24:06.129
Excellent artistic intention.

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:15.388
Oh.

01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:18.975
I was inspired by your wall.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.728
But I thought you,

01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:24.773
It's grown on me.

01:24:40.246 --> 01:24:42.332
Excuse me for a moment.

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:54.928
It turns out it was
never about the money.

01:24:59.099 --> 01:25:00.100
But I want a father.

01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:17.283
(birds chirping)

01:25:18.993 --> 01:25:22.580
Why didn't you call me?

01:25:22.622 --> 01:25:23.957
I came to see you.

01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:28.628
You were with your husband and

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:31.381
you looked together.

01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:35.301
He's the father of my daughter.

01:25:35.343 --> 01:25:36.636
I have to keep the peace.

01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:45.895
Okay well,

01:25:49.733 --> 01:25:50.650
what do we do now?

01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:54.654
We start again.

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:56.906
From the beginning.

01:25:58.033 --> 01:25:58.867
You go.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.119
Oh you mean now?

01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.287
Mhmm.

01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:03.830
Okay, I'm Jack.

01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:06.624
Hi, Natalia, nice to meet you.

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.501
I'm a hundred percent single.

01:26:08.543 --> 01:26:10.378
This is great news.

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.629
I have no job.

01:26:11.671 --> 01:26:14.549
This is terrible news,
goodbye. (laughing)

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:18.678
Okay, your turn.

01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:20.513
Oh.

01:26:22.223 --> 01:26:24.392
(sighing)

01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:29.898
Great mother.

01:26:33.568 --> 01:26:34.778
That girl is my heart.

01:26:36.071 --> 01:26:36.905
I know.

01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:40.867
I know.

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:50.877
I painted her about a
thousand different ways

01:26:52.879 --> 01:26:54.464
and barely scratched
the surface.

01:26:58.426 --> 01:26:59.594
This one's not bad.

01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:10.939
I'd put it on the main wall.

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.399
Which main wall?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.110
Kate's showing me a gallery
space in town tomorrow.

01:27:16.236 --> 01:27:19.406
I'm thinking of this
artist called Robert Foster

01:27:19.447 --> 01:27:21.199
for my first exhibition.

01:27:21.241 --> 01:27:22.742
You know him?

01:27:22.784 --> 01:27:24.202
Uh huh.

01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:25.078
That guy?

01:27:26.246 --> 01:27:29.082
Very rare to see any
of his later work.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.918
Although I hear he's
quite busy again.

01:27:32.752 --> 01:27:34.671
I heard that whisper.

01:27:35.588 --> 01:27:38.091
(light music)

01:27:39.259 --> 01:27:43.013
(singing in foreign language)

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.990
(light-hearted music)

01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:49.889
(light music)
