00:01.040 --> 00:02.836
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.592
Somebody has a gun inside
and they're shooting.

00:04.680 --> 00:05.635
We're getting out of here, okay?

00:05.720 --> 00:06.755
Get away from the door.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.478
We gotta get you somewhere safe.
Come on.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.198
No, don't leave me, please.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.793
You're gonna tape a line
down the center of the room.

00:11.880 --> 00:12.915
Go on!

00:13.000 --> 00:14.319
If I say,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.877
"I love you" right now,

00:16.960 --> 00:18.712
will you hold it against me?

00:19.840 --> 00:20.909
Don't push me.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.035
He's not gonna do it!

00:22.120 --> 00:23.838
- Back him up!
- Listen to him.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.115
I promise you.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.589
Whoever steps into that hallway
is gonna die.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.352
It's never gonna be the same.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.192
This is wrong, man. All of this.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.314
This is your fault.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.628
I just wanted it to stop.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.914
Just take it all back.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.353
You got to let me try to talk to him.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.953
Jimmy, please.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.593
I'm sorry.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.715
No!

00:41.280 --> 00:42.269
<i>He's gone, Danny.</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:43.349
<i>He's gone.</i>

00:56.640 --> 00:58.949
Over here, Danny. I found something.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.479
It's a raven.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.279
What's wrong with it?

01:04.440 --> 01:05.998
I think its wing is broken,

01:06.080 --> 01:08.196
but we can nurse him back to health.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.236
Come on, help me catch him.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.672
He'll fly again. You'll see.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.199
No! Why did you do that?
Why'd you kill him?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.834
He was weak.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.393
I wanna go home.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.315
"Oh, that I had the wings of a dove!

01:34.960 --> 01:37.952
"I would fly away and be at rest.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.673
"My companion attacks his friends,
he violates his covenant.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.916
"His speech is smooth,
yet war is in his heart.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.880
"But you, O God,
will bring down the wicked

01:52.280 --> 01:54.316
"into the pit of corruption.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.634
"Bloodthirsty and deceitful men
will not live out half their days.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.558
"As for me, I trust in you."

02:04.200 --> 02:08.512
And now, we ask for the strength
to navigate the stages of our grief

02:09.280 --> 02:11.475
as we lay our brother, Keith, to rest.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.876
<i>The stages of our grief.</i>

02:26.280 --> 02:29.352
<i>Anger, fear, guilt,</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:33.876
<i>depression, acceptance.</i>

02:48.320 --> 02:49.469
Dan.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.511
<i>And the first seeds of grief.</i>

03:19.760 --> 03:23.514
I guess everybody's just gonna change
and go back to Karen's, okay?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.556
People are definitely gonna change.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.873
Will you unzip me?

03:34.200 --> 03:37.033
Oh, Haley, I love you.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.313
I love you, too.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.912
It's all so uncertain.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.117
God, I love you.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.797
I don't ever want to come that close
to losing you again.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.590
I need you to be safe, okay?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.989
I told you. I'm not going anywhere.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.994
They expected 200 people at his wake.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.593
They got, like, 2,000.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.910
People loved Keith, you know?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.355
I was the worst mechanic on the planet,

04:20.320 --> 04:24.074
but he gave me a summer job
because he knew I needed the money.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.511
We hung out that whole summer
talking old-school basketball with him.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.158
Me, Skills, Mouth.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.315
And Jimmy.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.118
Jim's funeral is on Tuesday.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.470
Jimmy Edwards killed my uncle.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.518
Do not talk about him,
not in my mother's house.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.195
Peyton, hi.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.309
Hey.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.268
Lucas, I'm so sorry.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.158
I wanna thank you for saving my little girl.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.835
Thank you.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.589
Hey, buddy.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.715
Hey.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.119
I'm sorry I haven't checked in lately.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.033
- I've just been with Lucas and Karen.
- No, of course.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.349
I'm glad you're okay.
I mean, you're gonna be okay, right?

05:53.840 --> 05:55.159
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.754
I just have to do
some physical therapy stuff, so...

05:57.840 --> 05:59.478
Okay. Well, can I get you anything?
Any food...

05:59.560 --> 06:00.993
No, I'm okay, really.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.036
I just came to see Karen.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.235
Okay.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.393
Peyton.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.711
I'm really glad you're okay.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.590
Okay, we are the worst
family /friends in the whole world.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.352
We really should be at Lucas'.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.509
You're right.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.636
Just stay here for a second.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.229
Okay.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.752
You know, when I was a kid,
I had this morning paper route.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.150
And every morning
there was this moment,

06:44.240 --> 06:45.753
it was right around dawn,

06:45.840 --> 06:48.229
and I would just stop, breathe it all in.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.753
You could almost feel
the magic in the world.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.592
But lying here with you,
I feel that same stillness.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.914
I can almost believe that the world's
not as screwed up as I know it is.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.549
My mom's coming home. She called.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.918
Well, at least now you won't have
to live alone in this big giant house.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.479
No, but she will.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.636
I want us to live together.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.155
I wanna be your husband again, Haley.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.236
That sounds so good to me.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.552
But I have a roommate named Brooke.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.709
That doesn't matter.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.234
And our dream schools
are 3,000 miles away.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.309
Doesn't matter.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.994
- And neither of us have jobs.
- It doesn't matter.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.514
You know how long it took me
to realize that?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.108
The amount of time it takes
to pull a trigger.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.995
I love you, Haley James,
and that's all I need to know.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.110
And it doesn't mean
it's not gonna be hard.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.589
It doesn't mean
it's not gonna be confusing,

07:49.880 --> 07:52.599
but, whatever it is, we'll face it together.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.357
You are quite charming, you know that?

07:56.440 --> 07:57.953
You haven't even seen my A-game.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.315
Oh, Lord help me if that's true.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.593
It's Scott, by the way.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.437
You called me Haley James.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.991
Haley James Scott.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.872
And it always will be.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.918
<i>Welcome back, students.</i>

08:22.320 --> 08:25.437
<i>Today, as we return</i>
<i>to our school with heavy hearts,</i>

08:25.520 --> 08:27.272
<i>you will note some changes.</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:30.477
<i>At the entrance to our school,</i>
<i>you will see metal detectors.</i>

08:30.560 --> 08:32.278
<i>They are here for your safety.</i>

08:32.360 --> 08:35.318
<i>You will see an armed police presence</i>
<i>on campus.</i>

08:35.400 --> 08:37.470
<i>They are here for your well-being.</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:40.275
<i>We can try to make the school safer.</i>

08:40.360 --> 08:41.998
<i>We can try to protect you.</i>

08:42.080 --> 08:46.232
<i>But there are few precautions</i>
<i>that we can take to protect your hearts.</i>

08:47.920 --> 08:48.909
Hey.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.189
Hey.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.031
Let's just go to class, okay?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.153
- Come on.
- Hey, just...

08:56.240 --> 08:57.639
<i>I want to urge you all to reach out...</i>

08:57.720 --> 08:58.755
Give me one second.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.239
<i>... to your teachers and counselors today.</i>

09:00.320 --> 09:02.470
<i>Form grief circles and talk about it.</i>

09:03.480 --> 09:05.072
<i>If you're feeling scared,</i>

09:05.160 --> 09:07.799
<i>if you're feeling vulnerable or confused,</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:10.997
<i>don't keep it inside. Let it out.</i>

09:16.760 --> 09:18.398
<i>You are not alone.</i>

09:19.200 --> 09:20.838
<i>And this is your school.</i>

09:38.280 --> 09:39.679
Hey, roommate.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.749
Hey.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.754
This is the saddest thing.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.755
It's the material
for Karen's wedding dress,

09:51.240 --> 09:52.912
- I ordered it the morning...
- Yeah.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.550
Listen, I have some good news.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.709
Okay.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.031
Nathan and I want to be together again.
Like, for real.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.759
- Haley, that's awesome.
- Yeah, it kind of sucks, though.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.068
I'm gonna miss you.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.434
You've become a really good friend.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.953
Yeah, you, too.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.439
When am I losing you?

10:10.520 --> 10:12.351
Soon as we can find an apartment,
you know.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.873
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.030
Whenever that is, you go be happy.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.271
Life's too short, you know?

10:24.960 --> 10:27.554
Hey, kiddo. How'd you do at school?

10:27.640 --> 10:29.517
Fine, just tired.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.913
Well, the doctor said that would happen,
so, you know, just take it slow.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.514
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.758
Okay. Listen, I canceled my next run.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.829
Dad,

10:41.120 --> 10:43.793
you can't protect me
every second of every day.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.911
Well, that sucks.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.550
I never want to feel the way I felt
when I got that call

10:50.640 --> 10:53.393
saying my baby girl
was on the way to the hospital.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.674
I got one other call like that in my life.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.278
That's two too many.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.598
How much allowance
am I giving you, anyway?

11:06.680 --> 11:08.477
Ellie gave me those albums.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.514
I just can't bring myself to play them.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.233
Hey, Luke.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.469
Rachel.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.554
You send me this?

11:39.640 --> 11:40.629
Maybe.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.117
What are you doing?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.991
Nobody has all the answers,

11:49.120 --> 11:51.156
but we all have our "why's."

11:51.440 --> 11:53.715
Like, why did this happen?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.196
Why didn't we see it coming?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.476
Why do people watch <i>American Idol?</i>

11:58.600 --> 11:59.635
Come on.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.318
Welcome to detention.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.513
Hi, boyfriend.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.397
Do you really think
a party is appropriate, Brooke?

12:22.480 --> 12:25.756
It's not a party. It's more of a cleansing
for every kid in this school.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.912
You know, everybody's here,
everybody's invited, everybody's together.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.117
So just check it out, okay?
We've got co-ed bathrooms,

12:32.200 --> 12:34.111
science lab for drugs
and pharmaceuticals,

12:38.920 --> 12:40.797
and there's the tutor center.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.269
Anybody who needs a little extra help.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.590
Tonight, we're all together,
and we stop judging each other

12:45.680 --> 12:48.114
and let everybody heal their own way.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.434
If you need to do this alone, I understand.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.110
But if you need me, I'm here.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.195
Hey.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.950
You know, we should really
stop meeting up like this.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.359
I never did thank you.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.908
Hey, it's okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.434
God, I'm such a girl.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.714
You love me.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.631
Okay, that is so not fair.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.994
You probably just want to kiss me again.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.479
Dude, shut up!

13:27.280 --> 13:29.316
Okay, I kissed you, but I...

13:30.960 --> 13:34.350
I thought I was gonna die
and you took care of me.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.593
- So, you know, we...
- Yeah.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.715
I know.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.837
If I told you I loved you,
would you hold it against me?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.638
Luke, when I said that...

13:47.480 --> 13:49.835
Because I do, Peyton.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.230
But it's okay, because

13:54.840 --> 13:56.751
there's this other girl.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.308
I mean, you might know her,
her name's Brooke Davis

13:59.400 --> 14:01.789
and I am completely in love with her.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.637
You don't know how good it is
to hear you say that.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.749
'Cause I thought everything
was gonna get weird again

14:08.840 --> 14:10.910
and I really don't want it to.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.959
We're okay, right?
You and me, we're good?

14:17.880 --> 14:18.869
All right.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.313
I should go.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.429
Peyton,

14:25.160 --> 14:27.116
I'm sorry about your mom.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.794
Both moms.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.830
I don't feel like I've been there for you
the way I should have,

14:33.280 --> 14:35.032
and I'm just sorry for that.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.397
You know how proud Keith
must be of you, right now?

14:38.480 --> 14:39.674
I don't know if that's true.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.749
It is.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.270
Let Brooke help you out with this, okay?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.395
Don't shut her out.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.629
Why, did she say something to you?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.234
No, I just... I know how you are.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.998
I'm the same way.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.790
She gave you her heart, Luke.
You should give yours back.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.798
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.270
Hey, don't kiss anybody out there.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.198
You suck, you know that?

15:13.920 --> 15:16.559
Hey, wanna come dance with me?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.357
Everybody head to lockdown,
I got a shooter here.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.313
Shooters in the hallway.
Come on, everybody.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.998
Pull your head out of your ass
and show some respect.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.875
Lucas!

15:39.560 --> 15:40.754
Please stay!

15:40.840 --> 15:43.991
I can't, Brooke. It's not right!

15:44.080 --> 15:45.149
Why not?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.071
You wouldn't understand.
You weren't there.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.435
I may not have been inside that school,

15:49.520 --> 15:51.238
but that doesn't mean that I wasn't there.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.676
It doesn't mean that I don't carry that day
around with me like everybody else.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.795
I was there.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.950
And if a party helps
to bring us all together

15:58.040 --> 16:00.031
and helps everyone to deal with it,
then why not?

16:00.120 --> 16:01.758
Rachel, you know that this is wrong.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.479
Somebody died in that hallway.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.269
No, Luke. Two people died.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.278
I'm sorry, Brooke.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.632
I know you're trying to help me with this,
and I love you for it, but I...

16:20.800 --> 16:22.916
I just... I can't, okay?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.033
What's up, my brother?

16:46.120 --> 16:47.394
Nothing.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.190
So, listen, the guys talked and decided.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.840
We're not gonna go
to Jimmy's funeral tomorrow.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.514
I mean, Mouth's kind of tore up about it,

16:58.880 --> 17:01.872
but we all loved Keith.
It just don't seem right.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.589
You think there's a heaven, Skills?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.430
Do I think there's a heaven?

17:11.680 --> 17:14.069
Yeah, you know, like pearly gates

17:14.839 --> 17:15.909
and angels?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.510
I don't know about all that.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.955
Maybe some chrome gates
and some freaky angels.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.630
No, but I do think
there's something else out there.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.358
And I do think that

17:32.840 --> 17:36.230
whatever we do in this world
matters in the next.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.312
Yeah, before you came in,
I was thinking about Edwards.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.194
How he could take Keith's life.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.510
Luke, he wasn't right, dawg.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.109
Jimmy was sick.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.668
Is heaven the kind of place
that'll hold that against someone?

17:52.160 --> 17:53.878
You know, because if not,

17:54.720 --> 17:56.358
Jimmy's a victim, too.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.113
And right now,

17:59.920 --> 18:04.038
in your world beyond this one,
Jimmy and Keith are in the same place.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.554
I can't figure out
what kind of place that would be.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.554
It's a place you and I wouldn't understand.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.517
Or a place that doesn't exist.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.630
God, I love this song.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.111
You think that's okay?

18:24.640 --> 18:25.709
To, like,

18:27.080 --> 18:29.674
love a song and feel good
when you hear it?

18:29.120 --> 18:32.032
And, like, laugh and be happy?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.678
To be so in love with somebody
your heart aches?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.354
I mean, is that okay right now or is it just

18:41.280 --> 18:42.952
too soon?

18:44.320 --> 18:47.392
It's never, never too soon to feel like that.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.593
<i>Danny...</i>

19:03.520 --> 19:05.238
<i>Danny, I'm waiting.</i>

19:08.720 --> 19:10.392
<i>Why'd you do this to me?</i>

19:11.520 --> 19:12.669
I saw the light.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.914
I doubt it.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.110
Truth be told, I couldn't sleep.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.156
- Can I help you?
- No, Dan.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.678
You can't help me.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.956
You were horrible to Keith.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.990
Is it any wonder you can't sleep?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.908
Doesn't mean I didn't love him.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.638
Well, that's great, Dan.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.914
But how does it feel to know
you can never take any of it back?

20:06.040 --> 20:08.873
That for the rest of your life,
all you'll have is regret

20:08.720 --> 20:12.429
over a relationship you could have
repaired with a few kind words.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.473
But you couldn't even
find it in your heart to do it.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.639
Maybe I'll find those words with Lucas.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.669
Don't push me, Dan!

20:22.240 --> 20:25.312
Come on, Karen. He's old enough
to make his own decisions.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.870
Like when he went back into that school.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.998
Or when he pulled me out
of the dealership fire.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.316
Did you pull Dan out of the fire?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.999
- Mom...
- Did you?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.109
Yes.

20:51.360 --> 20:54.716
You selfish, stupid boy.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.958
Did you think about me?

20:58.560 --> 21:00.630
Just once, think about me,

21:00.320 --> 21:02.629
and what my life would be like
if I lost you?

21:02.560 --> 21:05.870
Running into burning buildings,
high schools with guns.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.077
Did I raise an idiot?

21:08.680 --> 21:11.069
I know! Okay, I know! It's my fault!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.757
If I didn't go back in there,
Keith would still be here.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.794
And I'm sorry.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.679
Well, sorry isn't gonna
bring him back, is it?

21:20.160 --> 21:22.116
You have to let it go, Mouth.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.193
It's not your fault.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.792
I wasn't thinking that.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.079
Yes, you were.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.313
You have this ridiculous notion

22:06.640 --> 22:09.279
that because you were friends once,
you could have saved him.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.836
What's so ridiculous about that?

22:10.320 --> 22:11.514
Because you couldn't have.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.758
I was his best friend, Rachel.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.958
How many times did the guy call you
in the last year?

22:17.440 --> 22:19.158
Come on, look around.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.878
Everybody's here tonight.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.159
Geeks, stoners, jocks,

22:24.320 --> 22:27.073
maybe a few old friends
who forgot to stay in touch.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.268
That's how it's gonna change.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.990
But everyone's still divided.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.359
We stick to these rigid
circles of friends based on

22:34.040 --> 22:38.795
sports we play, or hobbies we like,
or how attractive or unattractive we are.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.872
When's that gonna change?

22:39.920 --> 22:41.114
Honestly?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.594
Probably never.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.470
Look, it's human nature.
People stick to their own kind.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.435
But if you want it to change,
then change it.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.673
I'll help you.

22:54.960 --> 22:55.995
How?

22:57.640 --> 22:59.119
Dance with me.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.834
Hey.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.749
Hey.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.315
Here.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.754
What is this?

23:25.440 --> 23:26.555
It's my door key.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.031
Actually, it's your door key.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.277
- Brooke, it's your place.
- No.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.274
It's always been your place. Both of yours.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.955
I was just keeping it warm
until you came to your senses.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.437
- Thank you, Brooke.
- Thanks.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.716
How's Lucas doing?

23:39.120 --> 23:40.633
I don't know, he left.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.352
I'm just trying to give him his space,
but it's hard, you know?

23:44.560 --> 23:45.709
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

23:46.520 --> 23:47.794
you kids be happy.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.956
One of these days, you'll make
the rest of us believe in true love.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.239
I wanna go find Lucas.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.792
Okay, let's go.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.235
Okay.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.999
Hey, hold on.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.718
Why did you do that?

24:06.040 --> 24:09.157
Because I don't think that you're
gonna like me 10 seconds from now.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.189
But...

25:34.880 --> 25:36.598
I released the time capsule.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.832
It's not your fault, Mouth.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.275
It's mine.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.273
You're right.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.118
I don't like you.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.429
Hey.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.349
Here.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.796
I'm taking my predictions back.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.313
Not gonna come true now, anyway.
Not without Keith.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.794
Luke...

26:29.480 --> 26:30.993
My mom

26:32.880 --> 26:34.916
thinks that this was my fault.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.388
She would not say that.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.554
Yeah, well, she pretty much did.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.798
We shouldn't have gone back
into that school.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.198
She's wrong.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.029
Luke, Keith would've gone back into
that school if you were in there or not,

26:44.200 --> 26:46.236
because that is who he was.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.433
This is not your fault.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.393
Hey, she's right, Luke.
You did what he did.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.392
You went back in there to save a life.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.798
Otherwise, we might've been
at Peyton's funeral.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.519
And I couldn't save Keith.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.108
And neither could I.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.239
He loved you a lot, Luke. Just like we do.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.639
And so does Brooke.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.357
You think none of your predictions
are gonna come true?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.750
Look at the first one on your list.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.513
"This year, I'll try again with Brooke."

27:11.800 --> 27:12.915
Brooke?

27:14.000 --> 27:14.989
Brooke!

27:23.400 --> 27:24.719
She's gone.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.110
Coach, I can explain it all.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.678
That wouldn't matter,

27:30.400 --> 27:33.437
seeing as how I'm not here right now.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.917
Not that I approve of any of this,
but I guess

27:34.680 --> 27:37.592
kids getting drunk in school beats

27:40.400 --> 27:42.152
kids getting killed.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.396
Been meaning to talk to you.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.555
Truth of the matter is, I've been busy

27:53.800 --> 27:55.279
crying like a baby.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.918
They were gonna get married.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.873
Keith was gonna be my dad.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.149
No matter what any science or paper said.

28:04.960 --> 28:09.033
He was the man who influenced your life
more than anybody else.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.471
I saw it in you every day.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.476
I just want him to come back.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.191
I just want him to come home.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.953
It's not fair.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.037
I'm gonna tell you something.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.596
When my wife

28:23.680 --> 28:24.795
died,

28:26.640 --> 28:27.959
things got

28:29.760 --> 28:31.796
pretty dark there for a while.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.711
Nobody could talk to me.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.629
And then,

28:36.960 --> 28:39.599
one of my former players,

28:39.400 --> 28:42.437
kid may have been
the worst player I ever coached,

28:42.800 --> 28:45.030
waded into that darkness

28:44.040 --> 28:45.996
and pulled me to safety.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.279
That kid's name was

28:52.160 --> 28:53.479
Keith Scott.

28:55.480 --> 28:59.189
He said, "Coach,

28:59.680 --> 29:01.750
"I know you want some answers.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.230
"But what is the right answer?

29:07.240 --> 29:09.356
"Because there is no answer.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.553
"There's just life."

29:14.400 --> 29:16.868
Just life.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.188
Lucas,

29:19.680 --> 29:22.240
be the man that Keith taught you to be.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.232
Anything less will make this
a much greater tragedy than it already is.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.668
<i>Dan.</i>

29:28.160 --> 29:29.912
<i>Why'd you do this to me?</i>

29:31.560 --> 29:33.391
It's not gonna work, you know?

29:47.880 --> 29:50.348
I'm not gonna carry this around with me.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.912
I did what I did, and it's done!

29:56.280 --> 29:57.429
<i>Dan.</i>

29:59.360 --> 30:02.716
So you come around all you want, ghost.
You won't scare me.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.593
As a matter of fact,

30:03.760 --> 30:07.355
tonight I'm gonna sleep like a baby,
and you wanna know why?

30:05.280 --> 30:07.350
Because you started this war.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.032
I just finished it.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.598
I just finished it.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.395
This is Karen's wedding dress material.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.231
If only it were raining.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.598
I can take care of that.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.354
Come on.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.595
Hey.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.798
Do you know a Pete from Freak Out Boy?

31:04.520 --> 31:07.318
Tattoos, goofy grin,
about as tall as a fire hydrant?

31:11.880 --> 31:12.949
Fall Out Boy.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.479
Yeah, whatever.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.794
I can't believe I'm about to say this
to my high-school-age daughter,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.911
but he is waiting in that limo.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.719
Don't be long.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.629
Okay.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.550
I want you to know something.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.751
If anything ever happens to me,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.076
- if you ever lose me...
- Nathan.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.515
I want you to know
how happy you made me.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.719
How wonderful my life was with you.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.435
And I will always be with you.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.918
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.794
I know.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.430
I know, you're right. But if it does,

32:22.640 --> 32:25.473
I just want you to be okay, Haley.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.510
And know that you made me happy.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.118
You wanted rain.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.600
It is not possible to be this in love.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.393
Hey, pretty girl.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.875
Hey.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.232
I was gonna sleep in my car,

33:10.280 --> 33:13.033
but I heard a noise
and I think it was a bear or something.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.233
Well, where were you parked?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.918
Right outside here.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.839
Well, have I told you
how much I love you today?

33:18.800 --> 33:20.153
Not really.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.469
Well, I do.

33:24.400 --> 33:28.234
And even when I don't tell you,
it means a lot to me to know you're there.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.710
It means everything.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.149
I am here.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.434
We both are.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.349
I know.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.238
And it's good being here.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.798
Especially with you.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.952
I wish that it was me.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.231
I know that's horrible
and I know that's selfish,

33:48.840 --> 33:50.910
but I watched you rescue Peyton,

33:53.200 --> 33:54.952
and you told me you rescued Dan,

33:57.840 --> 33:59.876
and sometimes
I just wish you could rescue me.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.395
From what?

34:04.520 --> 34:05.748
From all of it.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.588
Okay, then.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.469
I will.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.431
If you promise to rescue me back...

34:12.800 --> 34:13.994
I promise.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.436
There's something else I need to do.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.197
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.793
How's the leg?

34:30.679 --> 34:34.389
Oh, it'll be okay. How's the boy?

34:39.880 --> 34:41.313
Lt'll be okay.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.351
- Oh!
- I'm sorry, Peyton.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.188
Why?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.833
Because I shouldn't have left you there.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.118
I thought that you were behind me...

34:52.600 --> 34:53.635
- Brooke, don't...
- No.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.391
I should've made sure.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.073
Okay. You're my best friend,

34:58.040 --> 35:02.352
and you wanna know what made me feel
better when I was trapped in that library?

34:59.160 --> 35:02.869
It was knowing that Brooke's okay.
You know, my best friend, she's safe.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.269
I love you for that, P. Sawyer.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.394
But there was something else
that made you feel better in that library.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.473
My boyfriend.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.637
And I guess I can't hold it against him,
can I? I mean,

35:16.880 --> 35:19.519
the boy I love protected the girl I love.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.798
That's the girl that he loves, too.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.675
- Brooke...
- No, we both know it's true.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.148
Okay.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.390
Look, come here, no... Come here.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.872
All right. I want you to listen to me.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.113
I care about Lucas,

35:40.920 --> 35:42.512
and I always will,

35:43.760 --> 35:46.354
but he's insanely in love with you.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.716
You know what? So am I.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.039
You're my Brooke!

35:52.040 --> 35:53.837
I'm not gonna hurt you again.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.000
Okay, 'cause I really don't want
to hurt again.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.913
Come here.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.116
You're something, you know that?

36:03.600 --> 36:06.160
I get shot and you're the one
that needs consoling.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.514
Sorry.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.468
You want a lift?

36:11.760 --> 36:12.988
Yes, I do!

36:14.400 --> 36:15.389
- Okay.
- Hold on.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.235
Okay, hold on.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.319
Please don't fall!

36:20.760 --> 36:21.795
No, I got you. I got you.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.751
- Am I that heavy?
- No, I got you.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.115
Okay.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.549
Oh, boy.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.874
Dad.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.268
What did you do?

36:38.280 --> 36:41.431
I know, your room's like some holy land,
forbidden to fathers,

36:42.400 --> 36:44.516
but I thought I'd make you some shelves.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.638
You know, sweetie,

36:45.400 --> 36:47.470
people will things that have

36:48.640 --> 36:50.278
given them great happiness in their life.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.354
Things that have helped them
make sense of the world.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.157
I'm sure that Ellie hoped that

36:55.720 --> 36:58.075
when you played these albums,
that you would remember her.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.829
And she would be with you in the music.

37:00.720 --> 37:01.789
Thank you.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.272
But where's my bed?

37:05.040 --> 37:07.031
I don't think you have room
for a queen-sized bed.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.512
I'm bringing two singles in here.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.039
Now that Brooke's moving in.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.755
What? Really?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.438
Best friends should stick together.
Welcome home.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.595
This is gonna be amazing!
I have to teach you the scrunchie system...

37:17.720 --> 37:20.996
No, no, no, no.
No nudity in our room, okay?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.550
But speaking of boys...

37:26.400 --> 37:28.436
Tonight, after the party,

37:28.840 --> 37:31.877
I hooked up with Pete from Fall Out Boy.
We made out!

37:32.240 --> 37:34.276
Oh, Peyton, we're gonna
find you a boyfriend, honey,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.479
you don't have to lie about it.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.033
- No, I...
- Now, how do you feel about a round bed?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.072
Whatever you say, roommate.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.112
Hey, Mom, you okay?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.399
What are you doing?

37:47.120 --> 37:49.190
It's what Keith would've wanted.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.558
Absolutely not.
You go to your room and you change.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.155
No.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.357
I said, go change.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.678
It's what Keith would want.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.874
