00:35.536 --> 00:38.205
MARIO Hi. You’ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.415
Please leave a message,

00:39.498 --> 00:41.584
and we’ll give you
a call right back.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.577
My love...

01:16.660 --> 01:19.413
We’re finally
getting out of this place,

01:19.497 --> 01:20.664
just like I promised.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.669
I sold it.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.797
I sold it to him.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.006
Yes.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.344
I love you.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.597
this thrill before...

01:36.680 --> 01:39.308
MAN:
She would be so proud.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.477
Always be a winner.

01:46.023 --> 01:49.360
You want her to be proud
of you, don’t you?

01:54.156 --> 01:56.742
would take wing

01:56.826 --> 02:01.664
would be through...

03:53.859 --> 03:56.737
You’ve gotten old, bitch...

04:05.663 --> 04:07.373
Let’s go.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.714
-

04:27.768 --> 04:29.478
-Chole.
-WOMAN: Hi, Lupita.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.402
-Hi, Helen.
-Morning.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.072
-Good morning, Lupita.
-Hi, John.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.164
Hola.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.624
-Hey.
-You, too, huh?

05:08.058 --> 05:10.644
Fucking hipsters.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.775
-Oh!

05:21.488 --> 05:23.032
-MAN: Babe, it’s all right.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.616
-Hello, Marcus.
-WOMAN: No, it’s not all right!

05:24.700 --> 05:25.826
Hey. How are you?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.745
¿Qué onda?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.418
You need some help, granny?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.921
You gonna be out here
showing weakness,

05:38.005 --> 05:40.591
you better come on inside
’fore somebody sees you.

05:40.674 --> 05:45.012
Mira, shut your cancer hole
and get me my coffee.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.765
-

05:51.518 --> 05:52.936
When are you gonna give up

05:53.020 --> 05:56.648
working on this old thing,
Clarence, eh?

05:56.732 --> 05:58.942
When it kills me-- that’s when.

06:00.402 --> 06:03.906
This here’s the only thing
my daddy ever gave me.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.158
-Mm-hmm.
-Told me, once we got her

06:06.241 --> 06:07.993
up and running again,

06:08.077 --> 06:11.747
she’d take us all the way
around the world and back.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.835
And that is exactly
what I aim to do.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.463
You’d be lucky to make it
out of Oak Springs, eh?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.465
-Ah.
-

06:21.548 --> 06:24.009
Where is Morris’s grumpy ass
this morning?

06:24.093 --> 06:27.096
Still convinced he can
get Yolanda’s dryer chair

06:27.179 --> 06:28.555
up and running.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.517
Son of a bitch don’t know an
electrical wire from his dick.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.063
Stubborn bastards,
the both of you.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.356
-Stubborn?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.191
Now, I know you
ain’t talking, granny.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.861
Morris ain’t
the only one missing

06:42.945 --> 06:44.655
round here today, neither.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.368
Good old fancy-pants Mario ain’t
showed up for his oil change.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.996
He loves that car of his
more than he loved his wife.

06:58.293 --> 07:02.589
Sorry. I guess six months
is too soon to be making jokes?

07:02.673 --> 07:04.258
Ah.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.218
Don’t worry about it.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.011
-Ow! Damn it.
-Ay.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.889
YOLANDA: It’s only the chair
that’s broken, Morris,

07:10.973 --> 07:12.933
and I have so many problems
with my landlord already

07:13.016 --> 07:14.601
without you fucking it up.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.312
Yolanda, wait a minute. I just
got one more little thing.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.648
-I’m telling you, it’s gonna
be done. -

07:21.567 --> 07:23.694
LUPITA: You’re gonna
mess it up even worse.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.070
MORRIS:
There we go!

07:25.154 --> 07:26.530
-

07:26.613 --> 07:27.906
MORRIS:
Shit! Son of a...

07:27.990 --> 07:30.075
Goddamn nearly shat myself.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.495
Laugh it up, you gargoyle, you.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.499
Go check on your greasy
boyfriend at the auto shop.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.001
All right, I’ll see you ladies
tonight, then, huh?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.503
Yolanda, Yolanda,
tomorrow morning,

07:41.587 --> 07:43.881
I’m coming back
with the proper tools,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.924
get this whole place
up and running. You’ll see.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.427
Thank you, Morris, pero no.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.053
-I’m going to get it done.
-Ay.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.763
-

07:55.851 --> 07:58.770
It still doesn’t
feel right, Lupita.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.689
Ay, por favor, Yolanda.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.941
Going through so much
trouble just for me.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.360
We’re the reason Mario can
afford to keep the doors open

08:05.444 --> 08:06.737
at the community center.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.072
-This is my problem, and...
Ay, no. Ay. -Look!

08:10.407 --> 08:13.535
I know when your pendejo
landlord raised your rent

08:13.619 --> 08:15.787
how much it hurt you,
and now this?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.498
And that’s nobody’s business
but my own, Lupita.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.835
I appreciate everything
you always do

08:21.919 --> 08:23.712
for all of us around here,

08:23.795 --> 08:26.006
but sometimes
I wish you could...

08:28.717 --> 08:29.760
Ay, mira.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.553
Did you see my new product?

08:31.637 --> 08:34.097
Yeah. Uh-huh.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.061
No Dolores again today.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.812
Pobrecita Dolores.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.899
Ever since they moved in,
I’ve been taking my walks alone.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.776
RAQUEL: Then why the fuck
did you invite us

08:45.859 --> 08:47.736
to stay, then, Dolores, huh?

08:47.819 --> 08:50.322
Because worrying about
my grandson out on the street

08:50.405 --> 08:53.116
keeps me awake at night--
that’s why.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.077
-Caleb, let’s go!
-I’m coming. Damn.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.288
And all of the trouble
that he got into--

08:58.372 --> 09:01.583
he’s lucky that he didn’t get
locked up in juvie.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.585
But you know what, probably
would’ve been better for him,

09:03.669 --> 09:05.462
’cause he sure don’t get
no discipline at home.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.838
I said I was sorry.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.257
I mean, it’s not like anybody
got killed or anything.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.843
DOLORES: Where are you going,
anyway? Out shopping?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.262
Jesus, Raquel.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.139
You haven’t given me a nickel
since you been here,

09:16.223 --> 09:19.685
and you’re always out there
shopping and buying clothes

09:19.768 --> 09:22.229
and shit you know damn well
you can’t afford.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.690
RAQUEL: Dolores, I cannot have
this fucking conversation!

09:24.773 --> 09:25.816
Caleb, let’s go!

09:25.899 --> 09:27.359
Come on,
your mom’s calling you.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.242
-

09:35.325 --> 09:37.327
RAQUEL:
Come on!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.293
-YOLANDA: Lupita?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.044
-Hmm?
-Don’t you think it’s time

09:46.128 --> 09:48.714
to let go of
the gangster bandana, hmm?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.465
No, why?
I love my gangster bandana.

09:51.842 --> 09:54.136
-YOLANDA: Oh.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.557
Did you get rid of her?

09:58.640 --> 10:01.351
What my son ever saw

10:01.435 --> 10:04.062
in that pasty bitch,
I will never know.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.857
-But the boy...

10:06.940 --> 10:09.735
Raquel lets him do
whatever he wants.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.737
She lets him get away
with everything.

10:11.820 --> 10:16.366
My son would’ve raised him
right, but that woman-- mm-mm.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.660
Sounds just like
his daddy to me.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.078
What?

10:21.538 --> 10:23.415
What?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.711
We’re supposed to pretend
your son was perfect?

10:27.794 --> 10:30.630
Por favor, you remember
when him and Eric...

10:30.714 --> 10:34.718
I did the best I could
under the circumstances,

10:34.801 --> 10:38.513
and you know more
than anybody how...

10:38.597 --> 10:41.516
I-I-I’m not going there
with you. Excuse me.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.477
Okay, señoras,
señoras, señoras.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.854
-Lupita, Lupita.
-Hmm?

10:45.937 --> 10:47.981
-Play nice.
-

10:56.073 --> 10:59.117
I should get to
the bingo hall anyway.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.202
Dolores.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.580
I love you.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.749
-

11:05.832 --> 11:07.250
I love you, too.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.835
Get out of here.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.005
YOLANDA:
Gracias, Lupita.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.804
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Lupita.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.271
LUPITA:
"Big winner."

11:28.355 --> 11:30.482
-

11:41.868 --> 11:44.454
¿Ay, qué es?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.040
Guácala.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.811
Hi, Helen.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.898
-Hello, darling.
-Hey. How you doing, Lupita?

12:11.982 --> 12:14.109
ERIC: So, you see,
it’s never too late.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.111
Remember, no matter
how many times

12:16.194 --> 12:18.029
you’ve tried to change
and failed,

12:18.113 --> 12:19.614
you’re here now.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.907
All right, let’s close it up.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.036
God, grant me the serenity

12:25.120 --> 12:26.538
to accept the things
I cannot change,

12:26.621 --> 12:28.498
the courage to change
the things I can

12:28.582 --> 12:30.208
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.586
Thanks for coming.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.756
You sound good up there, mijo.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.427
Strong.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.387
Convincing, güey.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.977
I’m so glad you’re
convinced, Doña Lupita.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.479
You here to set up then?

12:50.562 --> 12:52.063
Of course.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.024
Are you joining us tonight?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.484
You know bingo is not my thing.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.652
Maybe in like 50 years
when I’m y’all’s age.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.200
You fool.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.371
It’s weird seeing you
without Ms. Dolores.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.209
She’s got family
to take care of.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.127
Me, I’ve got Oak Springs.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.214
Or what’s left of it.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.635
Fucking tanning salons and
shitty coffee shops all over.

13:21.718 --> 13:25.639
Well, as long as you’re around,
Oak Springs will never die.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.099
Shit, you are Oak Springs.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.976
You and the rest
of them old fogies.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.772
Come on, after what y’all did,
you and Dolores are legends.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.900
Oh. I got it.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.902
Mario gave you
a copy of the keys?

13:38.985 --> 13:41.071
Even with all those tattoos
on your neck?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.949
Nah, these are his.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.451
Found them hanging
from the front door.

13:46.535 --> 13:49.871
You just found them?

13:49.955 --> 13:51.915
Doesn’t sound like him.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.042
Did you talk to him, call him?

13:54.125 --> 13:57.337
Nah, I figured Mario, with all
the shit he had to deal with...

13:58.463 --> 14:00.298
Let me see your phone.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.349
MARIO
Hi.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.976
You’ve reached
Mario and Patricia.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.143
Please leave a message,

14:12.227 --> 14:14.521
and we’ll give you a call
right back.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.527
Could be he really wants
to be alone right now.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.113
Know what I’m saying?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.322
No.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.242
I’m gonna get you
on that new dating app...

14:27.325 --> 14:30.120
"Smooches for Old Scrooges."

14:31.204 --> 14:32.872
Definitely need to
get you out more.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.710
Take time to just kick back
and just relax for once.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.296
Stop shopping
at consignment shops.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.591
Get you an upgrade at one
of them new retails opening up.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.092
You know what I’m saying?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.388
LUPITA:
I-26.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.435
-LUPITA: N-42!
-

14:53.518 --> 14:56.563
N-42, two, two, two, two!

14:56.646 --> 15:00.442
another, just let it go...

15:00.525 --> 15:04.571
O-65, 65.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.367
The next number...

15:09.451 --> 15:11.703
is...

15:11.786 --> 15:13.872
-You having a stroke, old lady?
-

15:13.955 --> 15:16.333
-

15:16.416 --> 15:18.251
D-7!

15:18.335 --> 15:19.502
-Lucky seven!
-MORRIS: D-7.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.630
MORRIS: Seven, seven.
I got that! Bingo!

15:21.713 --> 15:23.381
-Bingo. Bingo right here!
-Bingo?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.300
-Goddamn right.
-Right!

15:25.383 --> 15:28.011
DOLORES: Okay, we got
a winner, everybody!

15:28.094 --> 15:32.682
-Come on up, Morris, and claim
your prize! -Hey! All right.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.559
-Check that.
-Hey.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.687
You have won one free haircut.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.399
And don’t forget
what happened to Samson

15:41.483 --> 15:44.319
when he let Delilah give him
a little trim.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.782
Ooh...

15:48.865 --> 15:51.493
Yolanda, Yolanda, stand up.
Stand up, please.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.453
-Come on. Come on, come on,
come on. -Please, Yolanda.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.497
-DOLORES: Come on, come on,
come on! -Come on.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.669
Take a look around this room

16:00.752 --> 16:03.338
at all your neighbors
who care about you.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.131
Come on, give it up,
Oak Springs.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.258
-Give it up. Hey!
-Go, go, go!

16:07.342 --> 16:10.595
I have seen this woman
perform miracles.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.473
Look how she transformed me.
I look good, don’t I?

16:13.556 --> 16:15.475
Give me a round of applause.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.560
LUPITA:
Okay, okay, beautiful Dolores.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.896
How much did we raise tonight?

16:19.979 --> 16:23.274
DOLORES:
Drumroll, please!

16:23.358 --> 16:26.611
$511 and...

16:28.321 --> 16:29.656
...four cents.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.992
Now, which one of y’all
was donating pennies

16:33.076 --> 16:34.994
with your cheap ass?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.579
Morris?

16:36.663 --> 16:37.956
Eh...

16:38.039 --> 16:40.875
DOLORES:
Beautiful Princess Yolanda,

16:40.959 --> 16:42.377
put your hands out.
Come on.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.421
Come on. Don’t be shy.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.798
With love from Oak Springs.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.259
Come on. We love you.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.681
We take care
of each other here.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.433
This is our home.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.101
Oak Springs!

16:58.184 --> 17:01.980
And we are working hard
to keep it, and we...

17:02.063 --> 17:04.315
-DOLORES: The hell?

17:04.399 --> 17:06.609
-Ay, Morris.
-What?

17:06.693 --> 17:09.279
It’s not like Mario
not to pay his electric bill.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.239
Okay, ladies, next time.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.657
Let’s go, Morris.
Grab the beer.

17:12.741 --> 17:16.286
All right, people, game’s over.
Thanks for coming.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.210
Step aside.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.545
I’ll take care of it.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.338
Mario gave you a copy?

17:27.422 --> 17:28.798
-Please.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.259
As if you wasn’t
in his business enough.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.929
Damn, gave me
a shitty copy anyway. Mm.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.230
Oh. Nice ride.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.816
It damn sure don’t belong
to nobody around here.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.944
It’s the same guy
I saw earlier.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.821
Whose car is this?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.490
And why is it here, hmm?

17:53.573 --> 17:57.243
Probably one of them
rich hipster assholes.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.413
-What about Mario?
-What about Mario?

18:00.497 --> 18:03.041
Clarence told me
he didn’t show up

18:03.124 --> 18:04.375
for his car appointment
this morning.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.044
His car appointment?

18:06.127 --> 18:07.253
Yeah, yeah.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.005
Should we call
the National Guard?

18:10.548 --> 18:14.552
Eric said Mario’s keys were just
hanging from the door earlier.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.555
Lupita, the man is old,
in case you haven’t noticed.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.683
And the power,
the power going out.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.895
Lupita, the man
just lost his wife

18:23.978 --> 18:28.691
after years of watching the
cancer just eat away at her.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.403
I can’t imagine what something
like that does to your head,

18:32.487 --> 18:36.324
so how about we just cut him
a little slack

18:36.407 --> 18:39.160
about being forgetful, okay?

18:41.079 --> 18:43.039
Let’s stop by his house!

18:44.707 --> 18:48.837
No, we are not
stopping by his house.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.381
It’s been six months.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.550
Let’s leave him alone.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.053
What if it’s something else?

18:57.136 --> 19:01.724
Lord, if you’re listening,
there’s a crazy woman down here.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.936
Dolores, I got that feeling.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.356
And you know more than anybody
what that feeling means.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.401
Yeah, I know what it means.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.903
-A pain in my ass!

19:18.491 --> 19:20.869
Don’t touch that car!

19:20.952 --> 19:22.161
Oh, God.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.414
Lupita, it’s late. Come on.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.959
Let’s go so we can get
some rest, for God’s sake.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.211
And tomorrow,
if you haven’t heard from him,

19:30.295 --> 19:31.296
we do it your way.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.965
You never let me
do fucking anything.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.769
MARIO Hi. You’ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

19:46.853 --> 19:47.979
Please leave a message,

19:48.062 --> 19:49.939
and we’ll give you a call
right back.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.253
"Under new management."

20:12.337 --> 20:14.130
Ay, Mario, what did you do?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.852
¡Hijos de la chingada!

20:45.328 --> 20:47.038
-LUPITA: Mario.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.040
How could you sell it, Mario?

20:49.123 --> 20:50.375
Mario!

20:50.458 --> 20:52.961
Want to talk to me
about the bingo hall?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.837
Eh?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.383
I know you’re in there!

21:00.009 --> 21:01.010
Mario!

21:04.347 --> 21:06.099
You cook now?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.517
Good morning to you, too.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.602
I just thought it would
be nice. That’s all.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.729
Well, you’re burning the eggs.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.191
Uh, no soda before break...

21:16.818 --> 21:19.320
Oh, so it’s on now.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.406
-Ah.
-RAQUEL: All right.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.075
Smells good, right?

21:24.158 --> 21:25.535
Oh, and that coffee--

21:25.618 --> 21:28.329
I got that good stuff from
that new place down the street.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.206
None of that
store-bought bullshit.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.583
-CALEB: Real good, Mom.
-Thank you.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.503
DOLORES: Are there some
hidden cameras in here?

21:37.088 --> 21:40.508
’Cause you can cut the BS and
tell me what this is all about.

21:43.094 --> 21:47.724
I just wanted to do something
to show my appreciation...

21:47.807 --> 21:50.768
our appreciation for you.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.524
You want something.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.152
Money.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.737
That’s it. Mm-hmm.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.739
No, I know.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.532
A job, right?
You got a new job.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.117
That means we can
move back home now.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.660
Mom, please tell me
that we’re

22:07.744 --> 22:09.162
-moving back home. -How you
gonna burn up my good bacon

22:09.245 --> 22:10.496
and at the same time...?

22:10.580 --> 22:11.664
CALEB: You said we would only
be here for a little while.

22:11.748 --> 22:12.874
-DOLORES: Why don’t you
take back... -Mom.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.667
...some of those new clothes
that you bought?

22:14.751 --> 22:16.377
-But no...
-

22:19.005 --> 22:21.716
I already took the clothes
back, for your information.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.010
I just leave the tags on,
and I take them back

22:24.093 --> 22:26.054
-when I’m done with them, so...
-Raquel.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.184
How about if
I take you shopping

22:31.267 --> 22:35.188
and buy you some clothes that
you can cut the tag off of?

22:35.271 --> 22:36.939
How about that, huh?

22:40.651 --> 22:42.320
I’ll be fine.

22:42.403 --> 22:45.198
And for the record, I bought
that coffee with my money.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.951
Fuck this.

22:49.035 --> 22:53.289
And for your information,
I prefer store-bought

22:53.372 --> 22:55.416
to this liquid cat shit.

22:59.629 --> 23:03.591
Posted on my door,
your door and everyone else.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.676
Should I grab my shotgun?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.221
You know I still keep it
in the kitchen.

23:11.641 --> 23:14.018
"New management."

23:16.020 --> 23:17.230
Still no word from Mario?

23:17.313 --> 23:19.315
Stopped by this morning,
saw his car.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.983
No answer.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.819
I-If Mario’s looking to sell,
we can’t just...

23:22.902 --> 23:25.446
Sell? No, hombre.
No, no, por favor.

23:25.530 --> 23:28.491
Mario had a moment of weakness.

23:28.574 --> 23:32.745
But we won’t let that happen,
will we?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.044
Hell, Lupita, you knew Mario.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.213
He was never happy here.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.923
-And when Patricia died...
-MORRIS: Hey, hey. Whoa.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.300
Oak Springs
has been good to us.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.344
You have been good to us.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.012
-But look, Lupita...
-But what? But what?

23:50.096 --> 23:53.141
We’ve been struggling a long
time, granny. You know that.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.226
We love this neighborhood.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.396
But the people in this town have
been doing pretty goddamn good

23:58.479 --> 24:01.065
selling their property
to these rich bastards.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.360
And I don’t know, but sometimes
it don’t sound so bad.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.821
You’d piss your chones if I told
you the offer I got on my house.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.030
We all get the letters.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.074
I don’t blame Mario.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.368
Shit, for the right price,

24:12.451 --> 24:15.538
I could be laying on a beach
somewhere in a string bikini.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.290
-YOLANDA: Lupita.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.501
Don’t you think
we deserve better?

24:21.878 --> 24:23.296
Look, I’m a loyal man.
You all know that.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.340
Even when things got hard,
I stayed.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.760
I stayed out of loyalty to you,
Lupita. You understand?

24:29.844 --> 24:32.430
But where did all that loyalty
get me? Where? What?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.265
Nothing but pain. That’s what.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.392
You’re abandoning your home
for a little bit of money.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.227
-No.
-DOLORES: Lupita.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.314
None of us
are what we used to be.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.065
But we’re still here.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.278
Little older, little crankier.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.197
-But damn it...

24:51.532 --> 24:53.743
...we’re still here.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.411
We are.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.082
Where we have always been.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.211
-Sí.
-

25:04.212 --> 25:05.338
What’s the plan, granny?

25:13.262 --> 25:18.059
We show up tonight
and give this big asshole

25:18.142 --> 25:21.020
a proper Oak Springs welcome.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.356
-YOLANDA: Andale.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.168
Looks like a goddamn casino.

25:44.252 --> 25:47.505
Is it even possible
to do all this in one night?

25:47.588 --> 25:49.006
Of course it’s possible.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.259
Shit, come on,
I could’ve done it in less.

25:51.342 --> 25:54.303
Morris, you would’ve burned
the building down to the ground.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.681
I’d rather see a pile of ashes

25:56.764 --> 25:59.767
than whatever the hell
I’m looking at now.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.856
Let’s go introduce ourselves
to this pinche gringo.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.694
Now, now, now, now, w-w-wait.
We don’t know he’s white.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.654
ALL:
He’s white.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.824
-

26:20.913 --> 26:22.123
Holy shit.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.916
You can say that again.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.960
-Oh, what?
-Oh...

26:36.971 --> 26:38.931
YOLANDA: Can you imagine the
electricity bill for this place?

26:39.015 --> 26:40.016
Hey!

26:40.099 --> 26:41.976
For a bingo hall
in Oak Springs,

26:42.059 --> 26:43.728
this is a bit of an overkill,

26:43.811 --> 26:45.271
-if you ask me.
-Ay.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.565
Hey, Lupita.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.608
-Lupita.
- ¿Qué?

26:49.692 --> 26:51.485
Don’t you think
we should play, too?

26:51.569 --> 26:54.196
You know, to blend in?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.449
We are not playing.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.867
And to be honest,

26:57.950 --> 27:01.412
all of these people should
be ashamed of themselves.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.872
That was a good idea.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.874
LUPITA: It’s not...
it’s not a good idea.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.515
Is that Raquel over there?

27:24.101 --> 27:26.228
That bitch.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.648
Stay focused.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.901
-She’s here trying to
get rich quick. -Come.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.944
LUPITA:
Sit. Sit there.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.824
Mario’s been gone a day,
and all it takes

27:38.908 --> 27:41.994
is some blinking lights
to make them forget.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.705
Makes me sick.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.169
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen
of Oak Springs...

27:51.170 --> 27:54.340
I’ve got one question for you.

27:55.341 --> 27:59.303
Are you feeling lucky?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.695
Well, you can call me Mr. Big.

28:17.988 --> 28:21.200
And it is an absolute pleasure

28:21.283 --> 28:25.329
to welcome you all here
to the grand opening of...

28:26.580 --> 28:29.708
...of Mr. Big’s Bingo!

28:29.792 --> 28:31.794
LUPITA:
No.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.464
Well, here at Mr. Big’s Bingo,
we have only big prizes.

28:36.507 --> 28:39.927
Because everyone
deserves to be a winner.

28:40.010 --> 28:44.265
I look around this
beautiful community of yours,

28:44.348 --> 28:45.933
and you know what I see?

28:46.016 --> 28:47.935
I see dreams.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.439
Big-time dreams.

28:51.522 --> 28:55.568
I see potential in Oak Springs,
all these unfulfilled desires.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.989
And each and every one of you
has a big dream.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.532
I mean, who doesn’t?

29:01.615 --> 29:03.325
Am I right?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.539
No matter how happy,

29:08.622 --> 29:11.667
no matter how content
you may be,

29:11.750 --> 29:15.379
we all have that one thing,

29:15.463 --> 29:20.801
that one little thing
that we still yearn for.

29:20.885 --> 29:25.556
Like an eternal itch
you just can’t scratch.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.184
They say money
can’t buy you happiness.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.021
I disagree.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.941
You know what kinds of people
believe this nonsense?

29:37.151 --> 29:39.153
Losers.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.446
-

29:40.529 --> 29:42.364
MAN:
Losers?

29:42.448 --> 29:45.493
Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

29:45.576 --> 29:48.829
-CROWD: No! No!
-Losers!

29:50.206 --> 29:51.832
MR. BIG:
No.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.587
How about you, my dear?

29:58.255 --> 30:01.342
What’s the one thing
you most desire?

30:04.512 --> 30:06.305
What would bring you happiness?

30:07.681 --> 30:09.141
A new life.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.104
A new life, hmm?

30:25.491 --> 30:29.119
Well, here at Mr. Big’s Bingo,
you could win enough money

30:29.203 --> 30:32.206
to buy that new life
ten times over.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.212
Who’s ready to play the game?

31:09.243 --> 31:10.286
MAN:
Hey! Hey!

31:10.369 --> 31:12.246
-Oh, shit.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.039
MAN: Yeah, you better run,
little shit.

31:21.005 --> 31:23.215
B-14.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.434
G-46.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.739
G-51.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.867
RAQUEL:
Bing... Wait.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.952
Bingo. Bingo! Bingo!

31:52.036 --> 31:53.954
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I have bingo!

31:54.038 --> 31:56.040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.125
-Oh, my God! -You want it bad
enough, ladies and gentlemen,

31:58.208 --> 32:00.794
the luck will find you.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.921
Well, come on up, big winner.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.971
-Let’s see what you won.
-Oh, God.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.942
Holy shit.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.280
ANNOUNCER:
$10,000.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.993
Holy shit!

32:33.077 --> 32:35.079
I knew we should’ve played.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.122
I told you it was a good idea.

32:40.209 --> 32:41.543
-Oh, my God.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.254
MR. BIG:
Come back tomorrow night.

32:44.338 --> 32:48.842
Come back every night, where
the prizes will be even bigger.

32:48.926 --> 32:53.097
Or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.641
RAQUEL:
Yes! Fuck yes!

32:55.724 --> 32:58.143
And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.759
-CALEB: Mom?
-

33:34.012 --> 33:35.431
Mom?

33:36.724 --> 33:38.475
Can we talk about yesterday?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.227
I didn’t mean...

33:41.353 --> 33:43.272
I’m sorry. I didn’t...

33:51.989 --> 33:54.867
Mom.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.869
Mom! Mom, no!

33:56.952 --> 33:58.328
Mom, no!

33:58.412 --> 33:59.872
Caleb, what’s going on?

34:00.998 --> 34:02.541
Where’s your mom?

34:21.351 --> 34:23.687
No, you didn’t.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.731
RAQUEL:
A new life.

34:25.814 --> 34:28.150
That pasty bitch.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.991
by the dozens

34:36.074 --> 34:38.911
new cousins

34:41.830 --> 34:44.208
than money buys

34:44.291 --> 34:47.419
-Look at me!

34:47.503 --> 34:49.004
in balance

34:50.380 --> 34:52.966
she don’t try

34:53.050 --> 34:56.261
than money can buy

35:13.237 --> 35:15.864
-

35:29.127 --> 35:32.339
there’s a wrinkle

35:32.422 --> 35:35.509
there’s a twinkle

35:35.592 --> 35:37.344
-

35:37.427 --> 35:39.471
than money can buy

35:39.555 --> 35:41.640
Rich, bitch!

35:41.723 --> 35:44.059
She’s got
smarts that you don’t see...

35:49.565 --> 35:51.525
RAQUEL: You look just like
your fucking grandma

35:51.608 --> 35:52.985
when you look at me
like that.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.445
-Like I’m a loser.
-CALEB: I never said that.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.197
RAQUEL:
You think your mom is a loser?

35:57.281 --> 35:59.366
You don’t think I can make it
without your dad?

35:59.449 --> 36:00.909
I don’t know
if I have what it takes

36:00.993 --> 36:03.245
to be a mother
without your dad.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.291
-I went from being Raquel...
-

36:07.374 --> 36:09.126
to being Caleb’s mom.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.880
She had to give up
all her hopes and dreams

36:12.963 --> 36:14.590
for her kid just like that.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.384
If I ever wanted anything
for myself...

36:17.467 --> 36:18.927
I just want to remember
what it’s like to be me.

36:19.011 --> 36:21.054
Oh, I would be
a really shitty mom.

36:21.138 --> 36:23.473
I would be a selfish,
cold-hearted fucking bitch.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.962
MR. BIG:
All the desperate souls...

36:54.046 --> 36:57.215
-we feed off them.
-

36:58.508 --> 37:02.804
Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

37:12.105 --> 37:13.899
MR. BIG:
Oh, that’s it.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.901
-That’s it.
-

37:15.984 --> 37:19.321
Always be a winner.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.494
How do you know for sure
she left?

37:25.577 --> 37:28.664
She left me a shiny nickel.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.751
Now, that’s what she does.

37:32.834 --> 37:35.837
She left my son
I don’t know how many times,

37:35.921 --> 37:39.883
running off doing God knows
what with a baby at home.

37:43.178 --> 37:47.182
I can’t stop thinking
about last night-- that man.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.935
That nasty smile of his,
that...

37:50.018 --> 37:51.728
Oh, please, Lupita.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.106
Don’t start all of that
again, okay?

37:54.189 --> 37:56.316
And that prize?

37:56.400 --> 37:59.277
You ever seen a bingo game
with a prize like that?

37:59.361 --> 38:03.740
No. I’ve lived in Oak Springs
most of my life, remember?

38:03.824 --> 38:06.243
Oak Springs
seems like the last place

38:06.326 --> 38:08.203
to open a big-money
bingo hall.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.457
Well, Oak Springs is changing,
so maybe it’s perfect for all

38:12.541 --> 38:13.667
those new tech companies
moving in.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.295
Ese hombre is a snake.

38:17.379 --> 38:21.425
Those flyers were meant for us.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.644
We need to find Mario!

38:32.728 --> 38:34.730
-No.
-Maybe he knows something.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.106
Lupita.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.316
What are you doing, Dolores?
Get up.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.609
Vamonos. Órale.

38:39.693 --> 38:41.737
I don’t have the time
or the energy

38:41.820 --> 38:45.240
to be playing Batman and Robin
with your behind.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.242
Those days are long gone.

39:00.797 --> 39:03.800
I’ll handle this shit myself.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.602
Please don’t do nothing crazy.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.169
I don’t give a fuck...

40:17.833 --> 40:19.584
Mario?

40:21.503 --> 40:22.879
Mario?

40:37.936 --> 40:40.147
Mario?

41:06.548 --> 41:07.883
Mario.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.137
Mario.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.847
What is this?

41:15.932 --> 41:17.642
What happened to you, Mario?

41:20.770 --> 41:22.772
-

41:57.224 --> 41:59.226
Caleb?

42:01.478 --> 42:04.481
I’m stopping by Miss Lupita’s.

42:04.564 --> 42:07.776
Make sure she didn’t
do nothing stupid.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.404
DOLORES Okay?

42:13.156 --> 42:16.201
All right, now,
I won’t be long.

42:16.284 --> 42:21.122
I’m leaving my cell phone on
the counter in case you need it.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.619
I want to tell you

43:11.256 --> 43:14.467
got problems

43:15.844 --> 43:18.596
some are poor

43:20.682 --> 43:22.767
are for real

43:26.980 --> 43:29.399
Welcome to the game, gentlemen.

43:34.988 --> 43:37.198
some dues to pay

43:37.282 --> 43:40.618
-Now, who’s ready to win big?
-

43:40.702 --> 43:42.996
your very dying day

43:44.164 --> 43:46.374
-

44:24.704 --> 44:26.414
Ay, Dios.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.166
Ay, Dios mío.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.970
-

46:28.453 --> 46:30.914
MR. BIG:
You...

46:33.041 --> 46:35.585
...lose.

46:56.064 --> 46:58.066
-Aah! Whoa.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.527
-I come in peace, woman.
-Come in. Come in.

47:03.571 --> 47:04.989
Have you been resting?

47:05.073 --> 47:08.117
’Cause I know how you get when
you haven’t had your siesta.

47:09.202 --> 47:11.162
It’s not... It’s not...

47:11.246 --> 47:13.873
I swear to God I just...

47:13.957 --> 47:15.375
in the hallway...

47:15.458 --> 47:17.168
Hey, hey. Take a breath.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.591
Let that brain of yours rest
for one evening.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.346
Lupita, what?

48:05.258 --> 48:06.884
If you’re out
hitting up cars again,

48:06.968 --> 48:08.928
you’re in the wrong part
of town, little homey.

48:10.430 --> 48:11.639
Look, man,
I didn’t take nothing...

48:11.723 --> 48:14.017
Find something good in there?

48:26.070 --> 48:29.198
Not here to fuck with you...
Caleb.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.869
I knew your pops
back in the day.

48:32.952 --> 48:36.080
We used to get into
all kinds of trouble together.

48:37.165 --> 48:38.875
-You knew my dad?

48:41.586 --> 48:43.171
He was like a brother to me.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.633
When I heard what happened
to him, I felt that shit.

48:46.716 --> 48:48.468
Sorry you had to
go through that.

48:49.552 --> 48:51.220
I grew up without parents, too.

48:51.304 --> 48:53.514
I had to make my own family.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.516
Other kids as screwed up as me.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.393
Not your pops.

48:57.477 --> 48:59.562
I’m talking about real fuckups.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.442
Dealing just to get by.

49:04.525 --> 49:06.027
Started using after a while.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.446
Where’s your friends now?

49:08.529 --> 49:09.822
Dead.

49:11.449 --> 49:15.745
As long as I had my high and
my money, I was good with it.

49:17.538 --> 49:19.624
It was like an infection.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.293
Ain’t no cure for that shit.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.174
Well, you got clean,
didn’t you?

49:28.257 --> 49:30.885
Getting clean ain’t the same
thing as getting cured.

49:30.968 --> 49:34.180
That taste...
that taste is permanent.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.059
Every morning, I feel the urge,

49:38.142 --> 49:42.647
and every morning, I got to make
the choice to ignore that shit.

49:49.821 --> 49:52.865
Well, if you got better,
why do you still live here?

49:52.949 --> 49:55.034
-What’s wrong with Oak Springs?
-It sucks here.

49:55.118 --> 49:57.787
There’s, like, nothing
but a bunch of old people.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.956
Except for you,

50:00.039 --> 50:03.042
-and you’re still kind of old.
-

50:03.126 --> 50:05.712
That’s ’cause most
everybody else gone already.

50:05.795 --> 50:09.048
Those old people are the closest
thing to a family I ever had.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.300
Lupita’s been
like a mother to me.

50:11.384 --> 50:13.219
That mean old Mexican lady?

50:13.302 --> 50:15.430
Yeah, that mean
old Mexican lady.

50:15.513 --> 50:19.016
Man, Lupita cleaned up
this whole neighborhood,

50:19.100 --> 50:21.102
helped kids like me
get our shit together.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.020
And not just Lupita.

50:23.104 --> 50:25.732
-Your grandma, too.
- Yeah, right.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.109
Those ladies were like
superheroes around here,

50:28.192 --> 50:29.402
for real.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.530
Ran those damn gangs
out of here like that.

50:33.948 --> 50:36.325
They built it up from nothing.

50:37.452 --> 50:38.703
That’s why Lupita’s
so protective

50:38.786 --> 50:40.163
of the neighborhood, you know?

50:44.792 --> 50:47.462
Last night,

50:47.545 --> 50:48.921
I heard my grandma talking

50:49.005 --> 50:52.383
about how my mom won big
at this new bingo place.

50:53.468 --> 50:55.344
And this morning, she was gone.

50:56.679 --> 50:59.265
If only I could get some money.

50:59.348 --> 51:01.768
I don’t know.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.733
She’s gonna come back for me.

51:15.740 --> 51:17.575
I hope you’re right,
little homey.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.160
I hope you’re right.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.415
B-13!

51:24.499 --> 51:25.875
CLARENCE:
Bingo!

51:29.212 --> 51:30.922
Bingo! Bingo!

51:31.005 --> 51:33.174
Bingo!

51:33.257 --> 51:35.218
-Son of a bitch!
-Come on, Oak Springs.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.970
Let’s hear it for
the big winner of the night.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.974
It’s all on me, baby.
It’s all on me.

51:48.981 --> 51:51.651
-ANNOUNCER: $100,000.
-MR. BIG: Big winner.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.236
Holy shit.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.004
Cocksucker.

52:13.089 --> 52:15.299
Will you please say something?

52:16.384 --> 52:17.718
What can I say?

52:17.802 --> 52:21.514
I want you to say
you will help me stop him.

52:21.597 --> 52:24.225
What if he did something
to Raquel to make her leave?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.602
How do we know he didn’t
take her out already

52:26.686 --> 52:27.687
like he did Mario?

52:27.770 --> 52:28.771
Take her out?

52:28.855 --> 52:31.315
-Yes.
-You are losing your mind.

52:31.399 --> 52:34.902
Dolores, you didn’t
see the way Mario was.

52:34.986 --> 52:36.904
There was money.

52:36.988 --> 52:38.614
There was green slime.

52:38.698 --> 52:40.825
It wasn’t natural. It was evil.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.535
-And...
-Okay, okay.

52:42.618 --> 52:44.996
What did the cops
have to say about it?

52:45.079 --> 52:46.789
Oh, please.

52:46.873 --> 52:50.585
Since when have we trusted
anything the cops have to say?

52:50.668 --> 52:52.461
They don’t care.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.422
And they don’t know Mario
like I do.

52:54.505 --> 52:57.884
Mario hated his life
in Oak Springs

52:57.967 --> 53:00.636
even before Patricia died.

53:00.720 --> 53:05.391
You were just too stubborn
to accept it.

53:07.727 --> 53:12.523
What if he felt stuck,

53:12.607 --> 53:14.233
with no way out?

53:14.317 --> 53:15.943
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

53:16.027 --> 53:17.403
Don’t even say it.

53:17.486 --> 53:20.156
Maybe he just got tired
of fighting a battle

53:20.239 --> 53:23.784
he knew
that he had already lost.

53:23.868 --> 53:27.204
And he’s not the only one
who feels that way.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.668
When my son got sick...

53:39.508 --> 53:41.510
I’m not doing this.

53:44.388 --> 53:46.599
Whew.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.100
Where are you going?

53:48.184 --> 53:49.894
To be with my grandson.

53:49.977 --> 53:52.521
He’s what matters most now.

53:52.605 --> 53:54.565
Oak Springs is all I have.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.151
He’s taking over,
and we have to do something.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.903
This is our goddamn neighbor...

53:58.986 --> 54:01.614
I am talking about my grandson.

54:01.697 --> 54:05.493
To hell with this neighborhood!

54:06.744 --> 54:10.331
I have fought with you
almost my whole life.

54:10.414 --> 54:11.499
We all have.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.543
And what do we have
to show for it?

54:14.627 --> 54:16.087
Nada.

54:16.170 --> 54:20.007
No money, no family, no future.

54:22.843 --> 54:25.179
But we got Oak Springs, right?

54:27.974 --> 54:30.810
And because of you...

54:32.186 --> 54:36.816
...we’re probably all
going to die right here

54:36.899 --> 54:41.153
in good old Oak Springs.

54:44.865 --> 54:48.619
Don’t make me
fight this alone, please.

54:50.371 --> 54:52.373
The fight is over.

55:23.112 --> 55:25.156
RAQUEL: Caleb’s
your problem now, Dolores.

55:25.239 --> 55:28.242
-Mom, Mom... Stop.
-

55:30.369 --> 55:33.581
-I’m rich, bitch.
-Stop, Mom. Stop. Stop. Stop.

55:33.664 --> 55:36.208
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

55:38.461 --> 55:41.338
in New Orleans

55:41.422 --> 55:43.591
Mmm, mmm.

55:49.388 --> 55:54.643
of many poor girls

55:54.727 --> 55:59.648
I’m one...

56:07.073 --> 56:09.325
Me and you...

56:09.408 --> 56:13.037
gonna take a ride across this
whole goddamn world together!

56:14.455 --> 56:16.540
Just like my daddy said.

56:16.624 --> 56:19.835
Leave all the bullshit behind.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.981
-

56:44.485 --> 56:46.862
That’s what I’m talking about!

56:53.244 --> 56:55.496
-

56:55.579 --> 56:57.665
-

57:00.459 --> 57:03.295
MR. BIG:
No matter how happy,

57:03.379 --> 57:05.965
no matter how content
you may be...

57:06.048 --> 57:07.716
Almost perfect.

57:16.267 --> 57:20.312
to New Orleans...

57:20.396 --> 57:25.025
MR. BIG: ...we’ve all
got that one little thing

57:25.109 --> 57:27.069
we still yearn for.

57:28.154 --> 57:30.406
Stubborn bastards.

57:30.489 --> 57:33.951
You’d be lucky to get out
of Oak Springs alive.

57:45.337 --> 57:49.300
-

57:49.383 --> 57:52.511
One more little tweak...

57:52.595 --> 57:56.765
-...and we’ll be ready to ride.

57:58.225 --> 57:59.894
-

59:34.113 --> 59:36.615
Yolanda! Yolanda!

59:40.703 --> 59:42.496
Chingada madre.

59:42.579 --> 59:46.500
-Chingado...

59:59.513 --> 1:00:00.639
Clarence!

1:00:02.641 --> 1:00:04.560
Are you in there?

1:00:04.643 --> 1:00:06.729
Clarence!

1:00:08.522 --> 1:00:09.815
Chingado.

1:00:14.903 --> 1:00:17.031
-

1:00:49.938 --> 1:00:53.025
-

1:00:55.027 --> 1:00:57.112
-

1:01:00.282 --> 1:01:02.368
-

1:02:31.623 --> 1:02:35.169
-Caleb.

1:02:35.252 --> 1:02:37.463
Caleb!

1:02:37.546 --> 1:02:39.173
Come help me.
The light’s out again.

1:03:33.894 --> 1:03:36.104
MR. BIG: And everyone
deserves to be a winner.

1:04:52.264 --> 1:04:54.266
Dolores! Caleb!

1:05:08.989 --> 1:05:10.949
No, no, no, no!

1:05:15.203 --> 1:05:17.039
-Eric, es Lupita.
-ERIC: Hello?

1:05:17.122 --> 1:05:18.790
I need your help,
mijo, pero ahorita.

1:05:18.874 --> 1:05:20.042
Hello? Hello?

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:21.335
Lupita?

1:05:21.418 --> 1:05:22.961
Lupita, tell me where you are.

1:05:23.045 --> 1:05:24.588
I’ll come get you.

1:05:24.671 --> 1:05:27.174
Hello? Lupita!

1:05:35.349 --> 1:05:37.809
No more games.

1:06:15.305 --> 1:06:17.140
-ERIC: Oye, Lupita.
- ¿Qué?

1:06:19.017 --> 1:06:21.061
I’m with you all the way.

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:23.271
Eric, be careful, mijo.

1:06:24.398 --> 1:06:26.233
We are all that’s left.

1:06:29.569 --> 1:06:30.696
Ya vete, cabrón.

1:06:30.779 --> 1:06:32.030
You’re going to make me cry.

1:06:32.114 --> 1:06:34.700
Okay, I’ll go around back.

1:06:34.783 --> 1:06:36.326
Chingada madre.

1:06:41.248 --> 1:06:43.041
What the hell
are you doing here? No.

1:06:43.125 --> 1:06:44.918
No, don’t get in there,
Caleb! No!

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:47.003
-

1:06:58.473 --> 1:06:59.975
MR. BIG: Come back every night,

1:07:00.058 --> 1:07:02.894
where the prizes
will be even bigger,

1:07:02.978 --> 1:07:06.481
or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

1:07:08.483 --> 1:07:09.943
And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:11.027
Loser!

1:07:11.111 --> 1:07:12.654
Caleb! Caleb.

1:07:12.738 --> 1:07:13.780
Caleb!

1:07:15.282 --> 1:07:17.784
-Fuck you.
-Come on, Caleb.

1:07:17.868 --> 1:07:19.202
-It’s too late.
-Come on.

1:07:21.371 --> 1:07:22.789
I made my decision.

1:07:24.499 --> 1:07:26.501
Oh, you’re hard now, huh?

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:30.172
Well, go ahead, big man.

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:32.924
Go ahead.

1:07:34.009 --> 1:07:35.135
You gonna use that thing
or what?

1:07:35.218 --> 1:07:36.428
Stop!

1:07:36.511 --> 1:07:38.930
You don’t know me
or anything about my family.

1:07:39.014 --> 1:07:40.307
You don’t understand.

1:07:40.390 --> 1:07:41.475
I have to do this.

1:07:41.558 --> 1:07:43.393
-With this money, I can...
-You can what?

1:07:43.477 --> 1:07:45.437
Buy your mama back?

1:07:47.481 --> 1:07:49.274
Money ain’t real, man.

1:07:49.357 --> 1:07:51.193
It can’t solve your problems.

1:07:52.903 --> 1:07:54.529
Trust me.

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:57.657
This shit...

1:07:57.741 --> 1:07:59.326
this shit ain’t the answer.

1:08:11.463 --> 1:08:13.006
I’m sorry.

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:16.718
It’s all right, Caleb.

1:08:24.893 --> 1:08:26.144
Caleb!

1:08:36.905 --> 1:08:38.240
Morris.

1:08:55.173 --> 1:08:56.883
I won’t let him have you.

1:08:57.759 --> 1:08:59.803
You don’t matter.

1:08:59.886 --> 1:09:01.221
Can’t you see that?

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:02.722
You’re nothing.

1:09:02.806 --> 1:09:06.226
All you are is in the way.

1:09:07.185 --> 1:09:09.312
I’m going to be a winner.

1:09:11.398 --> 1:09:15.402
I don’t need you.

1:09:20.824 --> 1:09:22.117
Yolanda.

1:09:23.201 --> 1:09:24.452
Yolanda.

1:09:39.050 --> 1:09:40.176
ERIC:
Caleb!

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:41.803
Easy.

1:09:41.887 --> 1:09:43.221
Easy, man.

1:09:44.389 --> 1:09:46.474
Let him go!
Leave him alone, man! Wait.

1:09:50.061 --> 1:09:51.396
What the fuck do you want?

1:09:55.817 --> 1:09:58.153
It’s what you want
that matters.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:02.574
You feel it every morning,

1:10:02.657 --> 1:10:06.745
and every morning,
you deny yourself.

1:10:06.828 --> 1:10:09.831
Don’t deny yourself, Eric.

1:10:09.915 --> 1:10:11.124
That’s it.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:13.543
That’s it.

1:10:30.101 --> 1:10:31.603
I won’t deny myself.

1:10:31.686 --> 1:10:33.355
Eric, no! No!

1:10:33.438 --> 1:10:34.439
Eric, no!

1:10:47.327 --> 1:10:48.411
No!

1:11:04.761 --> 1:11:06.304
I’m sorry.

1:11:08.682 --> 1:11:10.934
Winners only.

1:11:35.542 --> 1:11:37.377
Always be a winner.

1:11:45.552 --> 1:11:49.222
Wouldn’t want to end up like
your mother, now, would you?

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:53.351
Although she did smile
right up until the very end.

1:12:27.093 --> 1:12:29.137
You were right, Dolores.

1:12:30.221 --> 1:12:32.057
I let this happen.

1:12:34.142 --> 1:12:36.478
But it’s not too late.

1:12:40.982 --> 1:12:45.278
We may be older, but we still
have plenty of life to live.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.738
You hear me?

1:13:00.126 --> 1:13:03.546
Oak Springs, listen up.

1:13:04.881 --> 1:13:09.803
When our neighbors
started leaving Oak Springs...

1:13:11.471 --> 1:13:15.100
...I called them
cowards and traitors.

1:13:16.309 --> 1:13:18.019
But I was wrong.

1:13:19.104 --> 1:13:23.650
I thought that a neighborhood

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:26.653
and a community
were the same thing.

1:13:26.736 --> 1:13:29.823
A neighborhood is just a place.

1:13:31.991 --> 1:13:34.953
Oak Springs is more than that.

1:13:36.162 --> 1:13:37.872
We are Oak Springs.

1:13:37.956 --> 1:13:39.499
Us, the people.

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:41.835
And when Oak Springs
works together,

1:13:41.918 --> 1:13:45.004
there is not a pinche thing
in this world

1:13:45.088 --> 1:13:46.673
that can defeat us!

1:14:01.479 --> 1:14:03.648
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:14:05.024 --> 1:14:07.610
...and special guests...

1:14:09.737 --> 1:14:12.699
...welcome to Mr. Big’s Bingo’s

1:14:12.782 --> 1:14:15.869
Million Dollar Game.

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:21.666
Now, which one of you deserves
to be a millionaire?

1:14:21.749 --> 1:14:23.835
No!

1:14:23.918 --> 1:14:26.171
Don’t listen to him!
Don’t listen to him!

1:14:46.566 --> 1:14:48.568
Oh, can’t you see, Lupita?

1:14:48.651 --> 1:14:50.904
I’m just the same as you.

1:14:50.987 --> 1:14:52.989
You’re nothing like me.

1:14:53.072 --> 1:14:54.991
Oh? Is that so?

1:14:55.074 --> 1:14:58.411
Surrounding ourselves
with desperate souls.

1:15:00.413 --> 1:15:02.373
Fixing the game
so they need us.

1:15:02.457 --> 1:15:04.459
So, they can’t live without us.

1:15:04.542 --> 1:15:06.336
Caging them in.

1:15:06.419 --> 1:15:08.838
And then we feed off ’em

1:15:08.922 --> 1:15:12.759
again and again and again

1:15:12.842 --> 1:15:16.471
-and again and again and again!
-

1:15:20.808 --> 1:15:23.311
We use promises
like leashes, huh?

1:15:23.394 --> 1:15:26.564
Oh, keep ’em close, Lupita.

1:15:26.648 --> 1:15:29.317
Keep ’em close. Keep ’em close.

1:15:30.652 --> 1:15:32.862
Ah. Huh.

1:15:32.946 --> 1:15:34.739
Now...

1:15:35.949 --> 1:15:38.326
It’s game time!

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:48.127
G-59!

1:16:07.230 --> 1:16:09.816
Oh, B-11!

1:16:14.737 --> 1:16:15.947
CALEB:
Hey, fuck head.

1:16:28.543 --> 1:16:30.086
Shit!

1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:38.261
Oh, fuck.

1:16:42.557 --> 1:16:44.976
-Wake up. Wake up, please.
-

1:16:46.144 --> 1:16:47.228
Come on, old lady. Wake up.

1:16:47.312 --> 1:16:49.272
Wake up, please.

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:50.982
Lupita, please, wake up.

1:16:51.065 --> 1:16:52.608
MORRIS:
Yolanda!

1:16:52.692 --> 1:16:55.278
Yolanda. Yolanda.

1:17:09.751 --> 1:17:11.753
Lupita, please, wake up.

1:17:15.006 --> 1:17:16.174
Come on, lady, wake up.

1:17:30.355 --> 1:17:32.190
-

1:17:38.029 --> 1:17:42.075
You picked the wrong community,
motherfucker!

1:17:44.702 --> 1:17:46.871
Fucker. You’re mine.

1:17:46.954 --> 1:17:48.414
-

1:17:54.003 --> 1:17:56.214
Piece of shit!

1:17:56.297 --> 1:17:57.548
¡Dale!

1:17:59.092 --> 1:18:00.968
¡Hijo de puta!

1:18:06.349 --> 1:18:08.059
MORRIS:
Get him!

1:18:08.142 --> 1:18:09.310
Damn.

1:18:09.394 --> 1:18:10.603
MORRIS:
Kick that motherfucker!

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:12.563
Hit the motherfucker! Yeah!

1:18:15.858 --> 1:18:17.735
Get the fuck out of our house!

1:18:17.819 --> 1:18:19.487
-Son of a bitch!
-

1:18:19.570 --> 1:18:22.365
-MORRIS: Fucker!
-DOLORES: Who’s your mama now?

1:18:22.448 --> 1:18:25.910
MORRIS: Welcome to Oak Springs,
motherfucker!

1:18:25.993 --> 1:18:29.122
-DOLORES: Mr. Big Stuff.

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:31.040
MORRIS:
Motherfucker!

1:18:31.124 --> 1:18:32.333
Try me! Try me!

1:18:32.417 --> 1:18:34.669
Get up! Get up!

1:18:43.302 --> 1:18:45.054
You think you can beat me?

1:18:45.138 --> 1:18:46.681
Oh, no.

1:18:46.764 --> 1:18:49.016
The house always wins.

1:18:51.102 --> 1:18:52.812
I agree with that.

1:18:54.981 --> 1:18:59.777
Welcome to our house, ¡puto!

1:19:04.532 --> 1:19:07.869
-

1:19:16.085 --> 1:19:17.837
-

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:32.310
No, no, no, no.
No, not the... not the money.

1:19:36.147 --> 1:19:37.773
MR. BIG:
Oh, no. No, no.

1:19:37.857 --> 1:19:40.693
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-

1:19:44.071 --> 1:19:46.574
-Caleb!

1:19:49.285 --> 1:19:51.370
Yolanda. Yolanda.

1:19:51.454 --> 1:19:53.247
Lupita.

1:20:04.425 --> 1:20:06.344
Game over.

1:20:44.882 --> 1:20:46.509
MORRIS:
Where’s Clarence?

1:20:46.592 --> 1:20:48.594
Clarence!

1:20:51.055 --> 1:20:52.515
MR. BIG
The money.

1:20:52.598 --> 1:20:54.183
Money.

1:21:06.070 --> 1:21:08.656
Clarence, Clarence, did he...?

1:21:11.325 --> 1:21:13.160
No.

1:21:14.537 --> 1:21:15.997
Clarence.

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:34.640
YOLANDA:
So...

1:21:36.726 --> 1:21:38.019
What now?

1:21:42.732 --> 1:21:45.860
I’m sorry I kept you
all here for so long.

1:21:47.361 --> 1:21:51.741
I was too stubborn
to accept the truth,

1:21:51.824 --> 1:21:54.368
and I should have
listened to you.

1:21:55.369 --> 1:21:58.164
This place was never our home.

1:21:58.247 --> 1:22:01.459
You are my home, my family.

1:22:01.542 --> 1:22:04.629
It took all this
for me to see that.

1:22:04.712 --> 1:22:06.505
And now...

1:22:06.589 --> 1:22:08.549
And now what?

1:22:08.633 --> 1:22:11.260
We’re not dead yet, woman.

1:22:12.845 --> 1:22:14.805
Does that mean
we’re leaving Oak Springs?

1:22:15.973 --> 1:22:17.600
I’m just saying. I...

1:22:20.394 --> 1:22:24.065
We are Oak Springs, mijo.

1:22:25.149 --> 1:22:26.817
And so are you.

1:22:28.194 --> 1:22:31.781
So, can Oak Springs go
someplace by the beach, then?

1:22:35.534 --> 1:22:37.703
As long as we’re together...

1:22:39.163 --> 1:22:41.165
...it doesn’t matter
where we go.

1:23:14.949 --> 1:23:19.328
-

1:23:32.758 --> 1:23:37.012
that I dreamed for

1:23:37.096 --> 1:23:40.266
in life’s game

1:25:00.012 --> 1:25:03.182
and my loved ones

1:25:03.265 --> 1:25:05.100
yeah, I’ll leave
