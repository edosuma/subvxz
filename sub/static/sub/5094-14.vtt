00:14.983 --> 00:16.850
Good morning.

00:16.852 --> 00:18.619
I'm Frank Reagan.

00:18.621 --> 00:21.889
I'd like to welcome you all
to our fair city.

00:21.891 --> 00:25.025
I see a lot of familiar faces.

00:25.027 --> 00:27.394
Some new ones, and I look
forward to spending some time

00:27.396 --> 00:29.330
with all of you
over the next few days.

00:29.332 --> 00:31.699
If we all could just
settle down.

00:38.273 --> 00:40.474
Thank you.

00:41.276 --> 00:43.310
Gathered in this room

00:43.312 --> 00:45.512
are law enforcement
professionals

00:45.514 --> 00:47.581
from all over the tristate area.

00:47.583 --> 00:49.116
And it's an honor and a pleasure

00:49.118 --> 00:50.618
to have you with us.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.586
We got a lot of ground to cover

00:52.588 --> 00:54.288
and a wealth
of information to share,

00:54.290 --> 00:55.990
so let's get started.

00:55.992 --> 00:58.626
With an update
on this morning's schedule,

00:58.628 --> 01:00.794
Detective Abigail Baker.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.399
Good morning.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.702
There has been a switch
in today's lineup.

01:08.704 --> 01:11.005
First up will be
what was your 1:00,

01:11.007 --> 01:12.873
"The Knockout Game: Urban Myth

01:12.875 --> 01:14.375
or Alarming Trend?"

01:14.377 --> 01:15.442
The presentation on "Drones:

01:15.444 --> 01:18.279
Proactive Surveillance
for a New Er""

01:18.281 --> 01:20.547
has been moved to our last day,

01:20.549 --> 01:21.982
and your 1:00 is now...

01:21.984 --> 01:23.784
Stop and Frisk?

01:26.021 --> 01:27.354
No, actually.

01:27.356 --> 01:29.390
'Cause, uh, you know,
I want to volunteer

01:29.392 --> 01:31.258
to have you demonstrate
your stop and frisk on me.

01:36.831 --> 01:39.333
Duly noted, Deputy Chief Deluca.

01:39.335 --> 01:41.835
'Cause I'm packing,
if you know what I mean.

01:43.105 --> 01:45.205
And experience tells us
that stop and frisk

01:45.207 --> 01:47.308
is highly ineffective
when it comes to finding

01:47.310 --> 01:49.977
the itty-bitty contraband.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.553
Is it me or have we been walking
for a really long time?

01:59.555 --> 02:01.021
It's definitely not you.

02:01.023 --> 02:02.289
You have breakfast?

02:02.291 --> 02:03.724
No, and right about now,

02:03.726 --> 02:05.292
a roast squirrel
sounds appetizing.

02:05.294 --> 02:07.161
Are we still in New York?

02:07.163 --> 02:08.795
It's just
a little farther.

02:08.798 --> 02:10.030
Didn't he say that already?

02:10.032 --> 02:12.566
Yeah, a long time ago
when we were younger.

02:12.568 --> 02:13.867
This is Officer Flanagan.

02:13.869 --> 02:15.636
You first on the scene?
Yeah.

02:15.638 --> 02:16.637
All right, show us the way.

02:16.639 --> 02:17.838
Over here,
through the woods.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.306
Great.

02:19.308 --> 02:21.108
More hiking.

02:22.277 --> 02:24.211
Guy was walking his dog
up through here.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.913
Dogs went nuts over
this, started digging.

02:25.915 --> 02:27.414
And then?

02:27.416 --> 02:28.749
Guy opened the bag, called 911,

02:28.751 --> 02:30.484
and lost his breakfast
over there.

02:31.286 --> 02:33.120
Well,

02:33.122 --> 02:35.322
take a look.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.125
You know, it'd take
a strong guy to drag her

02:38.127 --> 02:39.893
all the way out here
in a golf bag.

02:39.895 --> 02:42.262
She been dead, what, a month?

02:42.264 --> 02:43.530
That'd be my guess, too,

02:43.532 --> 02:45.132
given the cold weather.

02:45.134 --> 02:48.302
She's wearing a vintage pink
Ambrogio Noto dress.

02:48.304 --> 02:49.303
Expensive?

02:49.305 --> 02:51.505
I couldn't even
afford a knockoff.

02:51.507 --> 02:52.840
She's gonna be tough to ID.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.408
Have to go off
the dental records or DNA.

02:54.410 --> 02:55.743
Is that a wig she's wearing?

02:55.745 --> 02:58.512
Yeah.
There's a story here.

02:58.514 --> 02:59.947
Yeah.

02:59.949 --> 03:02.649
A story with an unhappy ending.

03:07.757 --> 03:08.889
It's freezing out.
You really think

03:08.891 --> 03:10.124
you should be running
in this weather?

03:10.126 --> 03:12.393
I know, but I have
to get my workout in.

03:13.629 --> 03:15.796
Maybe you can skip it
for one day.

03:15.798 --> 03:18.665
I don't have to be
in until noon,

03:18.667 --> 03:21.135
so it's the only
opportunity.

03:21.137 --> 03:24.171
You know, I'm not gonna
be back until after 7:00,

03:24.173 --> 03:26.039
so maybe we should order in.

03:26.041 --> 03:28.175
That rice and beans
joint okay with you?

03:28.177 --> 03:30.144
Yeah, but, um,

03:30.146 --> 03:31.612
hold the onions on the avocado salad.
Hold the onions

03:31.614 --> 03:33.647
on the avocado
salad, I know.

03:33.649 --> 03:34.948
You have your MetroCard?

03:34.950 --> 03:36.083
I have my MetroCard.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.618
Okay, you have your phone?

03:37.620 --> 03:38.786
I have my phone, Mom.

03:38.788 --> 03:40.487
I'm fine.

03:40.489 --> 03:42.790
You're ready for that
English test, right?

03:42.792 --> 03:44.925
Would you just go
for your run, okay?

03:46.161 --> 03:47.928
Okay. Have a good day.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.129
Love you, Mom.

03:49.131 --> 03:50.397
Bye.

03:50.399 --> 03:52.065
Bye.

05:12.192 --> 05:13.593
Please forgive me.

05:13.595 --> 05:16.295
I am... desperate.

05:16.297 --> 05:17.396
Yeah, you must be.

05:17.398 --> 05:19.632
You just abducted
a Manhattan ADA.

05:21.201 --> 05:22.735
Who are you?

05:22.737 --> 05:25.138
My name is Doris Cooper.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.273
We have talked
on the phone

05:27.275 --> 05:28.841
about my son

05:28.843 --> 05:31.277
Timothy's situation.

05:33.113 --> 05:34.647
Timothy Cooper?

05:34.649 --> 05:35.948
Yes.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.416
Ma'am, I told you on the phone

05:37.418 --> 05:39.318
I'm not the prosecutor
on his case.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.487
I am very sorry.

05:49.997 --> 05:51.397
But I'm a dying woman,

05:51.399 --> 05:53.733
and I don't know
what else to do.

05:55.702 --> 05:57.637
So you came up with all of this?

05:57.639 --> 06:01.741
My son has been in jail
for two and a half years

06:01.743 --> 06:03.943
without a trial

06:03.945 --> 06:07.046
for a crime he did not commit.

06:09.049 --> 06:12.652
He is a gentle, innocent boy.

06:12.654 --> 06:16.055
He is charged
with second degree murder

06:16.057 --> 06:20.259
and possession
with intent to distribute.

06:20.261 --> 06:22.562
He went to get
that marijuana for me!

06:26.633 --> 06:28.834
For my pain.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.942
He didn't kill anyone.

06:35.944 --> 06:38.511
It is not in him to do that.

06:38.513 --> 06:41.614
No?

06:41.616 --> 06:44.250
And it's in <i>you</i> to do all this?

06:51.792 --> 06:53.726
Here's my address.

06:53.728 --> 06:56.128
If you think
I should be arrested

06:56.130 --> 06:58.364
for what I've done,

06:58.366 --> 07:00.466
go ahead.

07:00.468 --> 07:03.135
I don't care
if I die in prison.

07:03.937 --> 07:06.806
But please...

07:09.543 --> 07:13.012
...please help my son.

07:30.430 --> 07:32.164
<i>Reagan?</i>

07:32.166 --> 07:33.399
<i>Yeah?</i>

07:33.401 --> 07:35.368
Any luck on Jane Doe?

07:35.370 --> 07:37.236
We got nothing.
Nothing?

07:37.238 --> 07:38.971
We been through every
missing person file

07:38.973 --> 07:40.373
from Boston to Baltimore.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.674
We're coming up empty
on the vintage dress

07:41.676 --> 07:43.075
and the origin of the wig.

07:43.077 --> 07:44.176
Nothing. Reagan.

07:44.178 --> 07:45.611
What about the golf bag?

07:45.613 --> 07:46.912
Still working on it,

07:46.914 --> 07:49.482
but that model's been
out of production for six years.

07:49.484 --> 07:50.883
Oh, so more nothing.

07:50.885 --> 07:52.652
Okay. No, actually,
we do got something.

07:52.654 --> 07:55.054
M.E. says cause of death
was a broken neck,

07:55.056 --> 07:57.523
and our Jane Doe
is actually a John Doe.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.859
Okay. That's something.

08:01.795 --> 08:04.797
Yeah, it is.

08:04.799 --> 08:07.900
<i>And you've got</i>
<i>your weekly meeting</i>

08:07.902 --> 08:09.068
with the mayor
at 4:00.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.269
I met with him last week.

08:10.271 --> 08:12.872
But the two of you agreed
to weekly meetings.

08:12.874 --> 08:15.541
I think we agreed to try
to meet weekly,

08:15.543 --> 08:18.844
knowing one of us would postpone
and we'd both save face.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.613
There's something disturbing
on the Internet.

08:20.615 --> 08:22.782
A lot of things are disturbing
on the Internet.

08:22.784 --> 08:25.251
This joker laps Manhattan
in 24 minutes,

08:25.253 --> 08:27.186
claiming a world record.

08:27.188 --> 08:28.487
But listen to this.

08:28.489 --> 08:30.323
How do you
like them apples, Big Apple?

08:30.325 --> 08:33.359
Commissioner Reagan can't even
set up a decent speed trap.

08:33.361 --> 08:35.461
I don't think the timing
of this is an accident.

08:35.462 --> 08:37.363
Somebody is trying
to humiliate us

08:37.365 --> 08:39.799
because the summit
of the police chiefs is in town.

08:39.801 --> 08:40.633
And there's more.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.301
One down, four boroughs to go.

08:42.303 --> 08:45.071
Yee-haw!

08:45.073 --> 08:46.205
That's taunting.

08:46.207 --> 08:47.707
Well, alert Patrol

08:47.709 --> 08:49.008
and Bridge and Tunnel.

08:49.010 --> 08:50.543
This doesn't piss you off?

08:50.545 --> 08:52.645
On a scale of one to ten,
it's a one.

08:52.647 --> 08:53.879
Sir?

08:53.881 --> 08:55.748
What, Baker?

08:55.750 --> 08:57.249
I've seen the video, too.

08:57.251 --> 08:59.752
I've watched it a few times,
in fact.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.554
M-More than a few.

09:02.489 --> 09:04.757
I have a hunch
who may be behind it.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.759
Well,

09:06.761 --> 09:08.627
not a hunch, exactly, but...

09:08.629 --> 09:09.628
Out with it.

09:09.630 --> 09:13.065
Suffolk County
Deputy Chief Sal Deluca.

09:14.502 --> 09:16.102
Why?

09:16.104 --> 09:18.270
He asks me out.

09:19.439 --> 09:21.107
I always say no,

09:21.109 --> 09:23.743
but he never takes no
for an answer.

09:25.312 --> 09:28.280
Is this about him heckling you
at the meeting?

09:28.282 --> 09:30.282
No, sir.

09:30.284 --> 09:33.786
Because I think
you handled that pretty well.

09:33.788 --> 09:37.423
But I broke down the audio track
on the posting,

09:37.425 --> 09:39.859
and though the voice
is electronically disguised,

09:39.861 --> 09:42.194
the cadence,
pattern and phrasing

09:42.196 --> 09:44.330
are very similar
to the county deputy's.

09:44.332 --> 09:46.065
What's your baseline
for comparison?

09:46.067 --> 09:48.300
About 150 voice messages
from him.

09:48.302 --> 09:49.802
I saved some

09:49.804 --> 09:51.504
of the juicier ones
should his pursuits

09:51.506 --> 09:54.073
ever escalate into harassment.

09:54.075 --> 09:55.341
You're serious about this.

09:55.343 --> 09:57.676
Yes, I am.

09:57.678 --> 09:59.979
And the stunt itself
is up his alley.

09:59.981 --> 10:02.281
Last summer, he hired a plane

10:02.283 --> 10:04.717
to fly over my parents'
house in Ocean Bay Park

10:04.719 --> 10:06.252
pulling a banner

10:06.254 --> 10:08.754
that read, "Abigail,
don't deny destiny.

10:08.756 --> 10:09.922
Love, Sal."

10:09.924 --> 10:12.391
But this isn't that.

10:12.393 --> 10:15.261
Guys like Deluca,
when they go sour,

10:15.263 --> 10:18.197
they make the same gestures
in the other direction.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.234
And it'd be like him
to try and spread

10:22.236 --> 10:24.904
the humiliation around me.

10:26.706 --> 10:29.742
Your hunch strong enough
to look into it?

10:30.544 --> 10:32.645
Yes, sir.

10:32.647 --> 10:34.447
Done.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.818
I appreciate it.

10:41.823 --> 10:43.856
You know, if she's right...

10:43.858 --> 10:45.057
Big coincidence.

10:45.059 --> 10:46.425
But if she is...

10:46.427 --> 10:47.793
One a scale of one to ten?

10:49.664 --> 10:51.931
Six.

10:51.933 --> 10:54.099
And a half.

10:55.302 --> 10:56.368
You find anything?

10:56.370 --> 10:58.804
I couldn't find
a missing persons match,

10:58.806 --> 11:00.139
so I did a search for

11:00.141 --> 11:03.509
"drag queen Ambrogio
Noto pink dress"

11:03.511 --> 11:05.044
and this is
what came up.

11:05.046 --> 11:06.212
Tiffany Lamp.

11:06.214 --> 11:07.913
Yeah, a drag performer.

11:07.915 --> 11:09.682
This is Tiffany's Web site.
Hmm.

11:09.684 --> 11:10.716
Always wore

11:10.718 --> 11:12.918
a pink dress, kind of
a signature thing.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.386
I think he's
our victim.

11:14.388 --> 11:15.488
No, it's a she.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.389
When guys dress
in drag, the way

11:17.391 --> 11:18.991
they like to be
referred to is "she."

11:18.993 --> 11:20.860
Now, look
at that.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.628
Here's Tiffany
out of drag,

11:22.630 --> 11:24.129
and his name is...

11:24.131 --> 11:25.364
Terry Bell.

11:25.366 --> 11:27.066
How do you know all this?

11:27.068 --> 11:28.133
<i>Queen Bee.</i>

11:28.135 --> 11:29.835
The TV show?
Yeah.

11:29.837 --> 11:32.705
You watch a drag queen
competition reality show?

11:32.707 --> 11:34.507
No, well... Linda watches

11:34.509 --> 11:36.242
a drag queen competition
reality show

11:36.244 --> 11:37.810
and, you know,
we only got the one TV,

11:37.812 --> 11:38.811
so I gotta watch.

11:38.813 --> 11:39.979
You like it.

11:39.981 --> 11:41.013
No, I don't.

11:41.015 --> 11:42.014
I watch it for my wife.

11:42.016 --> 11:42.948
Uh-huh.

11:42.950 --> 11:44.850
Will you stop?
Look...

11:44.852 --> 11:46.385
seems she has
a steady gig

11:46.387 --> 11:48.387
at a place called
the Lipstick Lounge.

11:48.389 --> 11:49.421
What is that?

11:49.423 --> 11:50.556
It's a drag bar
on Avenue A.

11:50.558 --> 11:51.790
Let's go.
How do you know this?

11:51.792 --> 11:52.992
From <i>Queen Bee.</i>

11:52.994 --> 11:54.093
Well, what
about lunch?

11:54.095 --> 11:55.294
We'll eat it
on the way.

12:05.071 --> 12:06.839
♪ Don't you tell me maybe

12:06.841 --> 12:09.074
♪ Maybe I'm your baby

12:09.076 --> 12:13.078
♪ 'Cause baby wants
to come out and play. ♪

12:13.080 --> 12:14.947
That sounds good.

12:14.949 --> 12:16.549
Just remember to
show us your eyes

12:16.551 --> 12:17.850
and exit
stage left.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.184
Will do.
Okay.

12:19.186 --> 12:20.386
Who's next?

12:20.388 --> 12:21.754
Excuse me.
You in charge here?

12:21.756 --> 12:23.989
Yes, I am, but we
are not open yet.

12:25.091 --> 12:26.525
Detectives Reagan
and Baez.

12:26.527 --> 12:27.693
You open now?

12:27.695 --> 12:29.895
Take five.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.268
Tallulah Bangkok.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.836
Tallulah who?

12:37.838 --> 12:39.605
Tallulah Bangkok.

12:39.607 --> 12:40.940
From season two
of <i>Queen Bee.</i>

12:40.942 --> 12:43.342
Oh, you watch!

12:43.344 --> 12:45.411
Well, my wife
watches, you know.

12:45.413 --> 12:47.146
But, uh, we were totally
rootin' for you.

12:47.148 --> 12:48.380
Team Tallulah
all the way.

12:49.183 --> 12:50.583
She got screwed by the judges

12:50.585 --> 12:51.584
in the lip-synching.

12:51.586 --> 12:53.185
I know, right?

12:53.187 --> 12:54.653
Anyway...

12:54.655 --> 12:57.423
Uh, we came here
to ask you some questions

12:57.425 --> 12:58.591
about a Tiffany Lamp?

12:58.593 --> 13:00.893
Um, she's in Paris.

13:00.895 --> 13:01.994
Lucky girl.

13:01.996 --> 13:04.196
Actually, a body was
discovered yesterday

13:04.198 --> 13:06.532
buried in a golf bag
in Van Courtland Park.

13:06.534 --> 13:08.233
A golf bag?

13:08.235 --> 13:09.702
Yeah.

13:09.704 --> 13:11.303
We're not sure of the identity,

13:11.305 --> 13:13.572
but the victim was a male,
five foot five,

13:13.574 --> 13:16.241
wearing a vintage
Ambrogio Noto dress.

13:21.314 --> 13:23.616
Oh, that would have to be her.

13:23.618 --> 13:26.251
I'm sorry.

13:28.089 --> 13:29.455
I just...

13:31.425 --> 13:33.125
It's okay.
Take your time.

13:33.127 --> 13:35.327
Thank you.

13:36.196 --> 13:37.429
We were
very close.

13:37.431 --> 13:39.732
You were friends
a long time?

13:40.700 --> 13:42.801
We were at Yale
together.

13:44.372 --> 13:46.138
The same class.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.107
Two drag queens
at Yale just

13:48.109 --> 13:50.075
find each other
and cling, you know?

13:51.411 --> 13:53.545
I moved here about
six years ago

13:53.547 --> 13:55.280
and opened this place
up, and she's been

13:55.282 --> 13:56.982
performing for
me ever since.

13:56.984 --> 14:00.185
Do you have any idea who
might have wanted to harm her?

14:00.187 --> 14:02.021
I don't know.

14:02.023 --> 14:04.623
Some people
just hate us,

14:04.625 --> 14:06.091
you know?

14:06.093 --> 14:07.793
Because of the
way we're wired.

14:07.795 --> 14:09.294
It isn't right.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.596
No, it isn't.

14:10.598 --> 14:12.164
Can you tell us about Paris?

14:12.166 --> 14:14.733
In the fall...

14:14.735 --> 14:16.902
she met someone.

14:16.904 --> 14:20.072
I never met
the guy, but...

14:20.074 --> 14:21.807
about a month ago,
she showed up here

14:21.809 --> 14:23.976
engaged, with
a big diamond ring,

14:23.978 --> 14:26.445
and said she was
off to <i>Paris.</i>

14:26.447 --> 14:29.014
Um, do you know if
Tiffany might have

14:29.016 --> 14:31.350
left a makeup kit
or a hairbrush,

14:31.352 --> 14:33.719
something that we could
get a DNA sample from?

14:33.721 --> 14:36.555
Yes, upstairs in
the dressing room.

14:36.557 --> 14:39.825
I'll go get you one.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.131
Thorton, you got a minute?

14:46.133 --> 14:48.534
Just one.
I have a deposition downstairs.

14:48.536 --> 14:50.135
The Timothy
Cooper case...

14:50.137 --> 14:51.904
Oh, the mother must've
gotten to you.

14:51.906 --> 14:53.372
What makes you say that?

14:53.374 --> 14:55.441
She's written to
just about everyone.

14:55.443 --> 14:57.876
Yeah, well,
she did more than write.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.246
It's one I never heard before,
I'll give her that.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.082
He wanted to
score some weed

15:03.084 --> 15:05.718
to ease his dear
mama's pain?

15:05.720 --> 15:07.820
Yeah, well...

15:07.822 --> 15:09.822
he's been in jail
for over two years

15:09.824 --> 15:11.223
without a trial.
Why?

15:11.225 --> 15:14.626
Clogged courts, his
own defense motions.

15:14.628 --> 15:16.328
You know the system
as well as I do.

15:16.330 --> 15:20.132
Thorton, over two years
in jail awaiting trial?

15:20.134 --> 15:21.533
There's nothing
you could do here?

15:21.535 --> 15:23.168
I'm not Erin Reagan.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.070
I can't bat my eyes
and part the seas.

15:25.072 --> 15:26.839
That is not fair.

15:26.841 --> 15:29.374
I guess since you became
Supervising ADA,

15:29.376 --> 15:30.809
you're the expert
on what is fair.

15:30.811 --> 15:32.978
The right to
a speedy trial is fair,

15:32.980 --> 15:34.279
and that doesn't take an expert.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.647
Out of my hands.

15:35.649 --> 15:37.816
Gotta go.

15:38.785 --> 15:40.853
Can you just outline
the case, please?

15:40.855 --> 15:43.622
We have a drug
dealer shot dead.

15:43.624 --> 15:45.390
We have Doris Cooper's
son, Timothy Cooper,

15:45.392 --> 15:46.492
fleeing the scene.

15:46.494 --> 15:48.594
We have Marius Pierre,
his co-defendant,

15:48.596 --> 15:49.661
testifying that
Timothy Cooper

15:49.663 --> 15:50.796
shot the drug dealer.

15:50.798 --> 15:52.698
And we have an eyewitness,
Barbara Keyes,

15:52.700 --> 15:54.366
corroborating
his story.

15:54.368 --> 15:57.136
Why was Barbara
Keyes there?

15:57.138 --> 15:58.670
Girlfriend of
the drug dealer.

15:58.672 --> 16:00.672
And there's no prior connection

16:00.674 --> 16:02.875
between Marius Pierre
and Barbara Keyes?

16:02.877 --> 16:04.977
That was the first thing
the detectives looked at.

16:04.979 --> 16:06.879
And I looked
at it as well.

16:06.881 --> 16:07.913
No prior connection.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.181
I was not suggesting

16:09.183 --> 16:10.549
that you had not done
your due diligence...

16:10.551 --> 16:12.017
Yes, you were.

16:12.019 --> 16:14.019
I'm going to a deposition.

16:14.021 --> 16:16.021
You want to come along,
make sure I get that right?

16:17.223 --> 16:19.124
I just have
a feeling about this.

16:19.126 --> 16:20.793
Would you mind if I take a look?

16:20.795 --> 16:22.828
This is finally going
to trial next month.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.530
Keep me looped in,

16:24.532 --> 16:26.732
and do not sully my case.

16:31.104 --> 16:32.504
Reagan?

16:32.506 --> 16:35.007
Phone dump on Tiffany Lamp's
cell phone came back.

16:35.009 --> 16:36.775
A number of calls
to a burner cell,

16:36.777 --> 16:38.143
but it doesn't
lead back to anyone.

16:38.145 --> 16:39.478
Somebody didn't want
to leave a trail.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.013
Well, the night
she disappeared,

16:41.015 --> 16:42.581
her phone did make
a WiFi connection.

16:42.583 --> 16:43.582
Where from?

16:43.584 --> 16:45.417
The Capax
Infinity Club.

16:45.419 --> 16:47.152
That's all
Ivy League.

16:47.154 --> 16:48.120
Rich white guys.

16:48.122 --> 16:49.555
Well, our victim
did go to Yale.

16:49.557 --> 16:52.024
I'm talking about a
different Ivy League.

16:52.026 --> 16:53.425
More old school,
less drag queen.

16:53.427 --> 16:55.427
So we're looking for
a wealthy, Ivy League type

16:55.429 --> 16:57.729
who plays golf.
Yeah.

16:57.731 --> 17:00.132
That really narrows
things down.

17:07.233 --> 17:10.434
<i>Skip Ballister? Detective</i>
<i>Reagan.This is Detective Baez.</i>

17:11.067 --> 17:13.835
We're interested
in a Terry Bell.

17:13.837 --> 17:15.603
Uh, we believe
he was a member here.

17:15.605 --> 17:18.239
We do have a sizable membership.

17:18.241 --> 17:20.241
But let me search the records.
Great.

17:20.242 --> 17:22.109
He often dressed
in women's clothing.

17:22.112 --> 17:24.145
That wouldn't be in the records.

17:25.012 --> 17:26.380
Okay, yes.

17:26.382 --> 17:27.882
Terrence Bell.

17:27.884 --> 17:29.484
Yale, class of '05.

17:29.486 --> 17:32.220
Member number 2115.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.822
Uh... looks like he's
a little behind on his bill.

17:35.758 --> 17:38.593
Terry Bell was found
in a shallow grave

17:38.595 --> 17:40.094
in Van Courtland Park yesterday.

17:40.096 --> 17:41.662
Murder?

17:41.664 --> 17:43.998
That's the conclusion
we came to, also.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.366
Look,
we know

17:45.368 --> 17:46.968
he was here on
the day he disappeared,

17:46.970 --> 17:48.402
January 18,
so we're gonna need

17:48.404 --> 17:49.604
all your security camera footage

17:49.606 --> 17:50.905
from on or around
that date, all right?

17:50.907 --> 17:53.841
Our security footage
is deleted after 30 days.

17:53.843 --> 17:54.976
Great.

17:54.978 --> 17:56.277
Uh, what about billing records?
You got those?

17:56.279 --> 17:58.212
Oh. Those we have.

17:58.214 --> 17:59.580
Here.

18:02.451 --> 18:04.318
Terry Bell,

18:04.320 --> 18:05.953
January 18...

18:05.955 --> 18:07.488
Nothing on January 18.

18:07.490 --> 18:08.990
Well, look, six months ago

18:08.992 --> 18:11.192
he was coming here
a couple of times a week.

18:11.194 --> 18:13.161
What's an S.C. charge?

18:13.163 --> 18:14.796
Sidecar.
What's that?

18:14.798 --> 18:16.230
It's an old-timey
cocktail.

18:16.232 --> 18:18.466
Brandy, lemon juice, triple sec.
That's right.

18:18.468 --> 18:19.600
Rarely
ordered here.

18:19.602 --> 18:22.203
Starting in October,
no more S.C. charges.

18:22.205 --> 18:23.938
Maybe he went on the wagon.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.541
Or maybe somebody else
was buying the drinks.

18:27.476 --> 18:28.509
You know what?

18:28.511 --> 18:30.077
Search this, see if anybody else

18:30.079 --> 18:31.712
was ordering
sidecars here, okay?

18:31.714 --> 18:32.647
Let's see...

18:32.649 --> 18:34.682
Okay...
The only other

18:34.684 --> 18:37.552
member ordering a sidecar

18:37.554 --> 18:39.153
is member number... oh.

18:39.155 --> 18:41.222
That's Burden Maxwell.

18:43.192 --> 18:44.892
Burden Maxwell.

18:44.894 --> 18:45.993
And look at this.

18:45.995 --> 18:47.228
He ordered his first sidecar

18:47.230 --> 18:50.298
in October, just when
the victim stopped

18:50.300 --> 18:51.432
buying them.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.434
And in December it was
just about every day.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.436
What can you tell us
about this Burden Maxwell?

18:55.438 --> 18:57.338
He's going through
a terrible divorce.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.739
He's been
living

18:58.741 --> 19:00.374
in a suite of rooms
on the fifth floor

19:00.376 --> 19:01.742
for several months.

19:01.744 --> 19:04.812
All right, you think we might
find him up there right now?

19:04.814 --> 19:06.547
This time of day,

19:06.549 --> 19:09.016
he's often found in the library.

19:09.018 --> 19:10.384
Come with me.

19:13.722 --> 19:14.989
Burden
Maxwell.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.197
Burden Maxwell?
Yes?

19:23.199 --> 19:25.199
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

19:25.201 --> 19:26.601
We need you to
come with us, sir.

19:26.603 --> 19:28.269
Why?

19:28.271 --> 19:29.503
We need to ask you
some questions

19:29.505 --> 19:30.504
about
Terry Bell.

19:30.506 --> 19:32.440
Oh.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.008
We need you to
come now, sir.

19:36.945 --> 19:39.247
If possible,
I'd like to proceed

19:39.249 --> 19:40.581
through the club
with dignity.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.350
Please.

19:42.352 --> 19:43.684
Well, I'm not
gonna cuff you,

19:43.686 --> 19:45.253
if that helps.

19:45.255 --> 19:47.455
Let's go.

19:59.568 --> 20:00.501
Excuse me.

20:00.503 --> 20:01.736
Are you
Barbara Keyes?

20:01.738 --> 20:03.704
Whatever you selling,
I ain't buying.

20:03.706 --> 20:05.539
Actually,
my name is Erin Reagan,

20:05.541 --> 20:07.141
with the district
attorney's office.

20:08.877 --> 20:11.145
I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.

20:12.648 --> 20:13.981
You know what?

20:13.983 --> 20:16.183
I already answered
all y'all's questions.

20:16.185 --> 20:18.719
Same ones, two, three times.

20:18.721 --> 20:20.655
Why don't you go look up
all the answers I already gave?

20:20.657 --> 20:23.057
It will only be five minutes
of your time, ma'am.

20:23.059 --> 20:25.192
You want to talk to me?
Make an appointment.

20:25.194 --> 20:26.694
Like you would if I was white.

20:26.696 --> 20:29.530
I did try to make
an appointment.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.165
I believe you hung up on me.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.000
It's not a race issue.

20:33.002 --> 20:34.402
Yeah, sure.

20:34.404 --> 20:35.770
Never is.

20:39.007 --> 20:40.574
Nice coat.

20:56.091 --> 21:01.295
2002 Impreza WRX with
invalid New York tags

21:01.297 --> 21:04.031
went through the tolls
at exactly 0400 hours.

21:04.033 --> 21:06.334
Which matches up with the
time stamp on the tape.

21:06.336 --> 21:08.169
Who'd the plates
come back to?

21:08.171 --> 21:10.438
That is in
the blue file.

21:14.543 --> 21:17.011
Brent Pascucci.
Yes.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.716
So, a dead end
where Deluca's concerned?

21:21.718 --> 21:24.051
Not exactly.

21:24.053 --> 21:26.354
He's Deputy Chief Deluca's
brother-in-law.

21:31.126 --> 21:32.593
Okay.

21:34.329 --> 21:36.630
We can just call him Deluca now.

21:36.632 --> 21:38.699
Yes, sir, gladly.

21:38.701 --> 21:41.102
What's our next move, Detective?

21:41.104 --> 21:42.803
"Our," sir?

21:42.805 --> 21:44.472
You're the lead on this case.

21:44.474 --> 21:46.073
You want me to run with this?

21:46.075 --> 21:47.074
Baker,

21:47.076 --> 21:48.509
there's a quote,

21:48.511 --> 21:51.479
"Do what you love and you'll
never work a day in your life."

21:51.481 --> 21:53.314
Sir?

21:53.316 --> 21:56.684
Seldom applies with what
we deal with around here.

21:56.686 --> 21:59.687
It makes it that much more
important to seize the moments.

21:59.689 --> 22:01.088
What's your plan?

22:01.090 --> 22:04.892
I have an idea...

22:04.894 --> 22:08.029
but I'm not sure
the commissioner would sign off.

22:09.131 --> 22:12.433
Then let's hash it out
before we bring it to him.

22:15.504 --> 22:17.938
Mr. Maxwell, why don't you start
by telling me

22:17.940 --> 22:19.874
what happened with you
and Terry Bell?

22:19.876 --> 22:22.410
We met in October
at the library.

22:22.412 --> 22:24.478
And he was...?

22:24.480 --> 22:27.481
Yes, he was dressed as Tiffany.

22:27.483 --> 22:29.083
I was completely fooled.

22:29.085 --> 22:34.889
She was both brilliant
and beautiful.

22:34.891 --> 22:37.858
And coming off of 12 years

22:37.860 --> 22:41.929
with an absolute harridan
of a wife, I was intrigued.

22:41.931 --> 22:46.133
Okay, but you're
also surprised, huh?

22:46.135 --> 22:48.936
I mean, when you discovered
that she was actually a he?

22:48.938 --> 22:50.738
No, he told me that night.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.307
I was naturally
taken aback.

22:53.309 --> 22:58.379
But he was terrific company,

22:58.381 --> 23:03.117
and sartorial proclivities
notwithstanding.

23:03.119 --> 23:07.455
Okay. So you hit it off.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.156
No secrets.

23:09.158 --> 23:10.491
When'd it all turn?

23:10.493 --> 23:13.094
It didn't, really.

23:13.096 --> 23:17.665
We continued to meet for a drink
and-and discuss things.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.901
How about you just tell me
what happened January 18th?

23:20.903 --> 23:22.136
Well, by that time,

23:22.138 --> 23:26.941
our relationship had
progressed... significantly.

23:26.943 --> 23:29.410
We became lovers.

23:29.412 --> 23:31.879
I'd never been attracted to men

23:31.881 --> 23:33.848
but in this case, it was...

23:35.484 --> 23:37.918
...it didn't matter.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.754
I-I fell in love with a person.

23:40.756 --> 23:43.591
Anyway, that night,
I proposed we marry

23:43.593 --> 23:45.659
as soon as my divorce
became final.

23:45.661 --> 23:47.328
And he said no.

23:47.330 --> 23:48.963
Is that what happened?

23:48.965 --> 23:50.698
Oh, no, he agreed.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.701
We were gonna celebrate
in Paris.

23:53.703 --> 23:58.973
He was supposed to pack his bag
and get his passport.

23:58.975 --> 24:01.509
And then he ran off
with the diamond.

24:01.511 --> 24:02.843
I was played for a fool.

24:02.845 --> 24:04.712
And that's why you killed him?

24:06.248 --> 24:07.715
No. What are you talking about?

24:07.717 --> 24:09.350
He ran off with the ring.

24:09.352 --> 24:11.785
You got mad,
you went to get it back,

24:11.787 --> 24:13.687
you broke his neck.
That's what happened, right?

24:13.689 --> 24:15.556
He was murdered?

24:15.558 --> 24:17.091
Yeah, he was murdered.

24:17.093 --> 24:19.960
What the hell do you think
we're doing here, Mr. Maxwell?

24:22.964 --> 24:24.899
Can I, may I have
a moment alone?

24:24.901 --> 24:27.101
No, you may not have
a moment alone!

24:27.103 --> 24:30.571
Look, you said
you were gonna confess, right?!

24:30.573 --> 24:32.239
What the hell
are you confessing to?

24:32.241 --> 24:33.607
The diamond!

24:33.609 --> 24:34.575
The...?

24:34.577 --> 24:35.743
I know by rights

24:35.745 --> 24:37.912
it's communal property
in a divorce

24:37.914 --> 24:40.648
and it's worth $200,000
or $300,000,

24:40.650 --> 24:43.150
but that ring belonged
to my grandmother,

24:43.152 --> 24:44.685
and she didn't deserve it!

24:47.122 --> 24:49.123
Mr. Maxwell,
let me get this straight.

24:49.125 --> 24:52.426
You're not confessing
to killing Terry Bell?

24:52.428 --> 24:54.562
You're saying you stole
your grandmother's ring?

24:54.564 --> 24:56.997
Yes, from the safe-deposit box.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.632
I thought that's what
this was about!

25:00.002 --> 25:02.036
I...

25:02.038 --> 25:05.306
I loved him!

25:06.908 --> 25:09.910
I was gonna show him Paris!

25:12.815 --> 25:14.381
Sit tight.

25:19.888 --> 25:21.989
Hey, you get
a confession?

25:21.991 --> 25:23.524
Yeah. He stole
his grandmother's ring.

25:23.526 --> 25:25.392
What?

25:25.394 --> 25:28.195
He took a ring out of his own
safe-deposit box

25:28.197 --> 25:30.064
that was common property
in a divorce.

25:30.066 --> 25:31.699
Did you buy that?

25:31.701 --> 25:33.400
Yeah, I did.

25:33.402 --> 25:34.969
I don't think he's our guy.

25:37.139 --> 25:39.206
What do you think
we're looking at here?

25:39.208 --> 25:41.609
A $200,000 diamond.

25:41.611 --> 25:43.744
People have been killed
for a lot less.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.889
I need to speak to you
in my office.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.023
Okay.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.758
I went to see
Barbara Keyes.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.826
She's quite a charmer.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.661
Do you know
what she does for a living?

26:04.663 --> 26:06.263
She's not employed.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.598
And yet, she's wearing
a $3,000 coat.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.767
Her boyfriend was
a drug dealer.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.536
This was a new coat.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.338
The police found very little
cash after the murder.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.208
So she hides the cash,
after two and a half years,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.277
loses her discipline,
starts to spend.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.444
This is a lot of conjecture.

26:21.446 --> 26:23.780
I'm not done.

26:28.419 --> 26:29.820
I ran her license plate.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.455
Found out that the car used
to be registered in New Jersey.

26:32.457 --> 26:34.558
So I called a friend
of mine in Trenton.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.493
Turns out Barbara Keyes
has a juvenile record.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.962
I had it unsealed.
When she was 15,

26:38.964 --> 26:41.932
she was convicted on a
small possession of narcotics

26:41.934 --> 26:47.103
along with Timothy Cooper's
codefendant, Marius Pierre.

26:47.105 --> 26:50.240
She perjured herself.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.176
She testified that she had never
met Marius Pierre.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.911
I think it is clear

26:54.913 --> 26:57.113
that Keyes and Pierre set up
Timothy Cooper.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.650
In no world is looking through

27:00.652 --> 27:03.253
out-of-state juvenile records
standard procedure.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.655
In this prosecutor's world,
it is.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.725
Call Marius Pierre's attorney.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.126
Take the deal off the table.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.729
Tell him you have a problem
with Barbara Keyes' story.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.368
I'll offer murder two
and 18 years.

27:18.370 --> 27:22.138
Let's see how Marius
reacts to that.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.418
<i>All right, ladies.</i>

27:35.420 --> 27:36.686
Hey! Listen up!

27:36.688 --> 27:37.621
Hey, Tallulah.

27:37.623 --> 27:41.191
These are Detectives
Reagan and Baez.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.626
Ladies, we know
it's been a long night.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.227
We don't want to take up
too much more of your time,

27:44.229 --> 27:45.729
so we'll try
not to keep you.

27:45.731 --> 27:47.230
It's okay, Detective.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.899
I been dying to be kept.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.000
Mm-hmm.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.435
Larissa, this is serious.

27:52.437 --> 27:53.837
We've spoken
to everyone downstairs,

27:53.839 --> 27:55.105
we've asked
for their help

27:55.107 --> 27:57.240
and now we're asking
for your help, too, okay?

27:57.242 --> 27:58.875
We need to know
anything you can remember

27:58.877 --> 28:00.210
about the night
Tiffany was killed.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.512
We're particularly interested
in the end of the night;

28:02.514 --> 28:04.915
who she might
have left with.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.117
There was so much champagne.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.652
We were celebrating
her engagement.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.954
Ooh, goodness,
I was so trashed!

28:10.956 --> 28:12.756
Okay, ladies,

28:12.758 --> 28:14.090
this is pretty serious,
all right?

28:14.092 --> 28:16.126
I want you to go home,
rack your brains.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.128
Any little detail
you can remember,

28:18.130 --> 28:21.031
you call the number
on the back of that card, okay?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.333
You'd be surprised how many
cases get solved this way.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.169
We don't want Tiffany's
murderer to walk free,

28:26.171 --> 28:28.038
because this is someone
who might kill again.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.807
And this is someone who likes
to kill drag queens.

28:31.742 --> 28:34.110
Wow, that was real.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.979
No, this is real.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.715
Thanks for you time, ladies.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.165
Detective.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.701
Tallulah,
you look lovely.

28:57.703 --> 29:00.170
Do you have somewhere
a girl could go

29:00.172 --> 29:01.938
to get something off her chest?

29:01.940 --> 29:03.506
Sure. Um...

29:04.608 --> 29:06.476
Somewhere private?

29:08.045 --> 29:09.245
Oh.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.614
Gormley's office is empty.

29:11.616 --> 29:15.018
You two can go in there
to be alone.

29:15.886 --> 29:17.787
Thanks, partner.

29:18.990 --> 29:23.193
Okay, then. Right this way.

29:28.499 --> 29:31.868
Oh, this is too good.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.571
I'm just gonna turn
the light on here.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.406
No-no-no-no-no,
please.

29:36.408 --> 29:40.176
I have fantasized
my entire life of being

29:40.178 --> 29:43.847
the femme fatale
in a detective's office...

29:43.849 --> 29:45.749
and this lighting is perfect.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.717
Whatever makes you happy, then.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.753
Thank you
for indulging me.

29:49.755 --> 29:52.322
Any time. So, what is it

29:52.324 --> 29:55.191
that you, uh, want
to talk about, Tallulah?

29:55.193 --> 29:58.228
I have an idea who might have
killed Tiffany.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.497
Who?
Mickey O'Donnell.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.631
Who's Mickey O'Donnell?

30:01.633 --> 30:04.367
My business partner
at the Lipstick Lounge.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.735
Well, you never told me

30:05.737 --> 30:07.670
you had a business partner
at the Lipstick Lounge.

30:07.672 --> 30:10.206
It didn't occur to me at first.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.609
It's a wonderful partnership.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.544
He takes care
of the nitty-gritty:

30:14.546 --> 30:17.680
liquor orders, garbage removal,

30:17.682 --> 30:19.649
city inspections,
anything tedious,

30:19.651 --> 30:24.320
and that allows me to focus on
the art, be the rainmaker.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.724
Okay. So then, tell me why

30:27.726 --> 30:29.993
is it that you think
Mickey killed Tiffany.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.196
I've known him for many years,

30:33.198 --> 30:36.166
but I've never known him
to be with anyone.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.267
I'm listening.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.035
He lives not far from Tiffany,

30:39.037 --> 30:43.206
and sometimes, late at night,

30:43.208 --> 30:44.974
they would share a taxicab.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.210
Oh, you think Mickey and Tiffany
had a relationship.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.912
Behind closed doors.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.613
Behind closet doors.

30:50.615 --> 30:52.849
You catch on pretty fast.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.085
Well, that's why they gave me
a gun and a shield.

30:55.087 --> 30:59.389
Only, thinking on it,

30:59.391 --> 31:02.425
I realized
for the past few months,

31:02.427 --> 31:05.195
they <i>haven't</i> shared a cab.

31:05.197 --> 31:09.099
So Tiffany broke up
with Mickey

31:09.101 --> 31:11.101
around the time
she met Burden Maxwell.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.536
Yes. And then she shows up

31:13.538 --> 31:16.906
with the Rock of Gibraltar
on her finger and...

31:16.908 --> 31:20.610
And in a fit of jealous rage,
Mickey kills her.

31:20.612 --> 31:21.744
Yeah.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.948
This Mickey, is he
the strong, athletic type?

31:24.950 --> 31:26.683
Yes.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.719
And he plays golf.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.254
You don't say.

31:32.556 --> 31:35.492
So...

31:35.494 --> 31:37.494
do you go arrest him now?

31:37.496 --> 31:39.329
No, I'm not gonna
arrest him yet.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.931
Can you tell me when I can
find him at the club alone?

31:41.933 --> 31:43.833
Around 11:00 in the morning.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.669
He goes over the receipts
from the night before.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.104
Okay.

31:54.645 --> 31:56.846
I should get back to work.

32:05.589 --> 32:07.624
This is taken
from the pay phone at Rikers,

32:07.626 --> 32:09.592
between Marius Pierre
and Barbara Keyes.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.027
It's cued up to the good part.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.496
So how come
they saying your story

32:13.498 --> 32:14.564
don't check out no more?

32:14.566 --> 32:16.599
I don't know. You ask them.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.501
Oh, you saying
you talked to nobody?

32:18.503 --> 32:20.937
Bitch came to my house.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.138
What bitch?

32:22.140 --> 32:23.773
Some tall brunette Barbie bitch.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.109
I didn't say nothing.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.577
And she was all,
like, admiring my coat.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.445
Like, "How come
this piece of nothing

32:29.447 --> 32:31.381
got a nicer coat than me?"

32:31.383 --> 32:32.782
Here it comes.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.983
You bought a coat?

32:33.985 --> 32:35.318
What kind of coat you bought?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.252
You buy a shearling?

32:36.254 --> 32:37.954
I needed a damn coat!

32:37.956 --> 32:39.455
What's the matter with you?

32:39.457 --> 32:40.790
You weren't supposed
to spend none of it

32:40.792 --> 32:42.959
till after the trial,
that was the deal...

32:45.363 --> 32:47.764
Detectives are out
looking for her now.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.899
She'll be charged
with perjury, conspiracy

32:49.901 --> 32:51.568
and accessory to murder.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.870
I talked
with Marius Pierre's lawyer.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.005
He's recommending
that he take the 18.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.208
Good.

33:07.818 --> 33:09.385
I was wrong.

33:09.387 --> 33:11.387
Yes, you were.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.590
Live with it.

33:27.168 --> 33:29.840
<i>I heard about that.</i>
<i>speedster guy on the Internet.</i>

33:29.841 --> 33:31.540
Well, he's got
a heck of a lot of nerve

33:31.542 --> 33:32.741
calling you out like that.

33:32.743 --> 33:33.843
Must make you pretty mad.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.477
Oh, I don't care
about that, Linda.

33:35.479 --> 33:37.580
I got skin thicker
than a catcher's mitt.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.582
I'll tell you
what does make me angry, boys,

33:39.584 --> 33:42.218
is what he's doing
is dangerous to other drivers.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.386
When you catch him, will you
give him a speeding ticket?

33:44.388 --> 33:45.721
Oh, more than one.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.690
He has conveniently provided us

33:47.692 --> 33:49.225
with video evidence.

33:49.227 --> 33:52.094
What's the fastest you've
ever gone in a RMP?

33:52.096 --> 33:54.430
Uh, last year I was chasing
a perp down the FDR.

33:54.432 --> 33:55.831
We got it going about 85.

33:55.833 --> 33:56.599
Did you catch him?

33:56.601 --> 33:57.733
Yeah.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.101
Hit that traffic snag

33:59.103 --> 34:00.269
south of the Triborough Bridge.

34:00.271 --> 34:01.670
Slowed down to about five.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.106
I just hopped out,
jogged up and collared him.

34:05.142 --> 34:06.275
Wait, so who got

34:06.277 --> 34:07.943
the most speeding
tickets growing up?

34:08.713 --> 34:09.745
Was it you, Uncle Danny?

34:09.746 --> 34:11.080
No, it wasn't me.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.481
And it wasn't your Uncle Joe.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.949
In fact, it wasn't even
your Uncle Jamie.

34:18.588 --> 34:20.989
It was your lead-foot mother.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.190
Grampa!

34:22.193 --> 34:23.359
Mom!

34:23.360 --> 34:24.860
In Joe's hot rod.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.195
Yeah.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.163
SS Chevelle 396.

34:28.165 --> 34:29.164
I still miss that car.

34:29.166 --> 34:30.532
Which you totaled.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.268
Well, it wasn't my fault.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.004
You know, one in that shape now?
Upwards of 50 grand.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.672
Oh, thanks for the update.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.041
As I was saying.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.844
So your mother borrows Joe's car

34:42.847 --> 34:45.447
to take some friends
down to the Jersey Shore.

34:45.449 --> 34:49.118
Troopers clocked her
on the Garden State Parkway

34:49.120 --> 34:51.553
at 112.

34:51.554 --> 34:54.023
Oh, my God!

34:54.025 --> 34:56.458
One of the great things
about parents, Nicky,

34:56.460 --> 34:58.560
is you can learn
from their mistakes.

34:58.562 --> 34:59.795
Mm-hmm.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.397
I remember another time...

35:01.399 --> 35:03.365
Grampa, please!

35:12.976 --> 35:14.910
You picking me up
out there, partner?

35:18.281 --> 35:20.215
We're reading you loud
and clear, Mr. Maxwell.

35:24.921 --> 35:27.056
Hello.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.858
Can I help you with something?

35:29.860 --> 35:32.061
Yes.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.063
Is your name Mickey O'Donnell?

35:34.065 --> 35:36.065
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.334
My name is Burden Maxwell.

35:38.336 --> 35:40.602
I was engaged to Terry Bell.

35:42.138 --> 35:43.806
I think it's time
we have a chat.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.208
Think you need
to speak with my partner.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.576
Oh, no, sir.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.179
I'm certain that it's you
who I need to speak with.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.448
Have a seat.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.183
Thank you.

35:56.687 --> 35:59.555
It was a shame
what happened to her.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.023
Yes, it was.

36:02.425 --> 36:05.194
I was interviewed
by the police about the murder.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.729
Oh, yeah?
Yes.

36:06.731 --> 36:09.031
And it occurs to me, sir,

36:09.033 --> 36:11.000
that it was, in fact, you

36:11.002 --> 36:12.568
who committed this crime.

36:13.403 --> 36:15.337
What are you talking about?

36:15.339 --> 36:17.306
Mr. O'Donnell...

36:17.308 --> 36:20.309
I know you were lovers.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.877
I know he dumped you.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.579
And I know you were
unhappy about it.

36:24.714 --> 36:26.482
He expressed
his trepidation to me

36:26.484 --> 36:28.484
about your reaction
to our engagement.

36:28.486 --> 36:31.120
What do you want?

36:31.122 --> 36:33.856
I want the engagement ring.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.357
It belonged to my grandmother.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.492
I want it back.

36:36.494 --> 36:37.493
Maybe I don't have it.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.028
Then you will get it back.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.330
Oh, that can take a little time.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.665
Or maybe I should
just kill you, too?

36:43.667 --> 36:44.967
That's all we need.

36:44.969 --> 36:47.136
Let's go!

36:50.640 --> 36:52.274
I just what is rightfully mine.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.012
I don't want
any trouble with you.

37:06.222 --> 37:08.624
Never bring a bottle
to a gunfight.

37:09.292 --> 37:10.259
Don't move!

37:10.261 --> 37:12.327
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

37:12.329 --> 37:13.796
You okay?

37:13.798 --> 37:16.298
Yeah.

37:18.701 --> 37:20.436
Come on, get him out of here.

37:22.272 --> 37:24.473
Ms. Reagan?

37:26.843 --> 37:28.377
You asked to see me?

37:28.379 --> 37:32.214
Yes, well, I have some news.

37:32.216 --> 37:35.984
Marius Pierre agreed
to 18 years yesterday.

37:35.986 --> 37:37.853
And Barbara Keyes took seven.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.688
And Timothy?

37:42.859 --> 37:46.161
What is your son's
favorite meal?

37:46.163 --> 37:48.597
He loves my lemon chicken

37:48.599 --> 37:50.933
with roast potatoes.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.470
You should cook
that lemon chicken.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.538
He'll be home
for dinner tonight.

38:00.777 --> 38:03.245
How can I thank you?

38:03.247 --> 38:06.248
Ms. Cooper,

38:06.250 --> 38:09.852
as a mother,
I admire the length

38:09.854 --> 38:11.420
you went to for your son.

38:11.422 --> 38:13.455
I'm glad you understand.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.091
But as an officer of the court,

38:16.093 --> 38:19.194
I want to throw you in jail
for what you did to me.

38:20.730 --> 38:24.833
So you can thank me by leaving
before I change my mind.

38:49.459 --> 38:51.593
Sorry, forgot to lock.

38:51.595 --> 38:53.662
We don't open till 6:00.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.498
Tallulah Bangkok.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.267
I almost didn't
recognize you.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.635
It's Dennis at the moment.

38:59.637 --> 39:00.836
Ah.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.738
Dennis.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.741
Anybody around here know how
to make a sidecar by any chance?

39:05.743 --> 39:07.442
Sure.

39:07.444 --> 39:09.344
My best friend used
to drink them.

39:09.346 --> 39:12.047
Speaking of,
I thought you should know

39:12.049 --> 39:14.116
that, uh, Mickey O'Donnell's
gonna go away

39:14.118 --> 39:15.884
for a very long time.

39:15.886 --> 39:17.586
Good.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.322
Thank you.
You're welcome.

39:20.324 --> 39:21.957
Now, what are the chances

39:21.959 --> 39:24.226
of you getting another shot
at <i>Queen Bee?</i>

39:24.228 --> 39:25.761
Slim to none.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.864
Come on, my wife was
so sad when you lost.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.465
You got robbed!

39:30.467 --> 39:31.733
You know, you make it out

39:31.735 --> 39:34.102
like your wife makes
you watch the show.

39:34.104 --> 39:35.337
It's her show.

39:35.339 --> 39:36.538
Uh-huh.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.507
Well, I guess you could say
I've always been

39:38.509 --> 39:40.475
a big-tent kind of guy.

39:40.477 --> 39:42.711
Perfect.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.012
To?

39:44.014 --> 39:45.514
To Tiffany Lamp.

39:45.516 --> 39:46.882
Rest in peace.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.083
And to you, too.

39:48.985 --> 39:52.187
For a guy,
you are one tough broad.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.425
Hear, hear.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.561
<i>For our presentation today,</i>

39:59.563 --> 40:01.797
I'm calling an audible.

40:01.799 --> 40:05.367
Instead of the usual overview,
I've asked Detective Baker

40:05.369 --> 40:07.536
to walk us through
a developing case

40:07.538 --> 40:10.472
that she has taken the lead on.

40:10.474 --> 40:12.674
Detective?

40:19.816 --> 40:21.583
Thank you, Commissioner.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.719
What you are
about to see are stills

40:23.721 --> 40:26.154
from an exercise
we ran last night.

40:26.156 --> 40:29.024
As I'm sure you know,
we've had a kind of

40:29.026 --> 40:31.760
<i>Cannonball Run</i>
situation this week

40:31.762 --> 40:34.229
with an unidentified male
attempting speed records

40:34.231 --> 40:35.364
around our boroughs.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.233
We got his plate
number from readers

40:38.235 --> 40:39.501
at one of our toll booths,

40:39.503 --> 40:40.969
located the vehicle

40:40.971 --> 40:43.639
with help from various city
and state agencies,

40:43.641 --> 40:46.408
and set a drone on his vehicle.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.611
He lapped Brooklyn
via the Belt Parkway

40:49.613 --> 40:51.480
and the Brooklyn-Queens
Expressway

40:51.482 --> 40:53.515
at felony reckless speeds.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.017
And the drone followed him

40:55.019 --> 40:58.053
over the Nassau County border
to a Woodmere diner.

40:59.389 --> 41:01.590
Through this interactive
police effort,

41:01.592 --> 41:04.192
we were able to positively
identify the driver

41:04.194 --> 41:06.328
as he exited his vehicle.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.230
The driver is being arrested
at his place of business

41:08.232 --> 41:10.599
in Suffolk County as we speak.

41:10.601 --> 41:14.269
The identity of his accomplice
is still being sought.

41:14.271 --> 41:16.171
Deputy Chief Deluca?

41:17.507 --> 41:19.207
We still have
the citation awards

41:19.209 --> 41:21.009
and the cocktail reception.

41:21.011 --> 41:24.046
I, uh, I got to run,
ur-urgent business.

41:25.214 --> 41:27.215
What a shame.
