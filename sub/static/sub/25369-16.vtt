00:00.375 --> 00:02.461
Hello?

00:02.461 --> 00:05.297
Where am I?

00:12.638 --> 00:14.932
Well, this can't
be good at all.

00:16.475 --> 00:20.020
Okay, Pete, don't panic.
Uh, you can figure this out.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.023
Last I remember,
I was fighting Doctor Octopus,

00:23.023 --> 00:25.442
and then...

00:25.442 --> 00:29.029
I just needed
your defenses worn out,

00:29.029 --> 00:32.783
making you susceptible
to the download

00:32.783 --> 00:38.580
of my mind into your body,
permanently!

00:38.580 --> 00:40.791
Ock was in robotic form.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.459
Did he swap minds with me?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.294
Is that impossible?

00:44.294 --> 00:47.089
Does that mean I'm trapped
in some kind of machine?

00:47.089 --> 00:51.260
Um, bigger question:
if my mind isn't here,

00:51.260 --> 00:53.262
<i>wherever "here" is,</i>

00:53.262 --> 00:55.055
<i>then where on earth</i>
<i>is my body?</i>

00:58.100 --> 00:59.893
'Sup?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.020
That's what we were
waiting to find out,
same as you.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.606
[groans]
I'm betting it's about the bug.

01:04.606 --> 01:08.193
Getting chilly out there
these days with the Spider
tearing up the streets.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.071
Eh.
What? I'm making it up?

01:11.071 --> 01:14.032
Silvermane‐‐ taken down.
Same with Big Wheel.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.118
Hammerhead‐‐ demolished.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.203
Spider‐Man's ripping up
the whole underworld.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.038
And mean‐like.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.249
No more Mr. Nice‐Bug
or something.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.042
Pfft.
I seen him up close.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.212
Guy's just a circus acrobat
with a bunch of corny jokes.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.631
Total lightweight.
[sinister laughter]

01:30.674 --> 01:32.050
[yells]

01:32.050 --> 01:35.095
It's him!

01:35.095 --> 01:37.055
Yeah, but there's three of us
and one of him,

01:37.055 --> 01:38.890
so just don't let him‐‐
[both yell]

01:38.890 --> 01:41.143
Pick you off one by one?
[gasps]

01:44.062 --> 01:47.107
It's time
for a conversation.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.068
I intercepted a text
inviting you all here.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.403
Who sent it?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.822
I don't know what you‐‐
[yells]

01:53.822 --> 01:55.282
[grunts]
[groans]

01:55.282 --> 01:58.827
Okay. It was Sandgirl.
She called the meeting.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.496
Eh, some big plan.
I don't know what.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.750
Look, I'm innocent here.
I didn't even commit a crime.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.253
And you never will again.
[laughs]

02:08.253 --> 02:10.255
Things are different now.
[grunts]
[blow lands]

02:38.825 --> 02:42.579
<i>Everyone says they're impressed</i>
<i>with this new Spider‐Man.</i>

02:42.579 --> 02:45.332
<i>I'm here to tell you,</i>
<i>I don't buy it!</i>

02:45.332 --> 02:47.584
<i>Spider‐Man has a history...</i>
<i>[Otto Octavius' voice thinking]</i>
<i>Oh, I'm newer</i>

02:47.584 --> 02:50.796
<i>than you could possibly</i>
<i>imagine, old fool.</i>

02:50.796 --> 02:56.176
<i>With the brilliant mind</i>
<i>of Otto Octavius</i>
<i>now in Peter Parker's body,</i>

02:56.176 --> 03:00.847
<i>Spider‐Man's performance</i>
<i>has taken a quantum leap</i>
<i>by every conceivable metric.</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:02.641
<i>Parker wasn't worthy of this.</i>

03:02.641 --> 03:03.809
Good morning, Pete.
Hmm?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.936
Aah! I mean, uh,

03:05.936 --> 03:08.730
good morning to you,
too, dear Aunt May.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.943
[gasps]
Oh, good gracious!
Look at this!

03:12.943 --> 03:17.739
All right now.
Who are you, and what
have you done with my Peter?

03:17.739 --> 03:21.076
Nothing.
I've done absolutely nothing.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.787
[chuckling]
Ohh.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.164
I guess you really have
finally grown up.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.875
Ah.
[fake chuckling]

03:28.875 --> 03:31.294
A joke. How amusing.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.840
Yes, I am, uh, maturing
before your very eyes.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.261
For example,
look at the protein‐rich feast
I've concocted for you.

03:39.261 --> 03:43.348
No more of that sugary,
carb‐loaded mess
you call "wheat cakes."

03:43.348 --> 03:47.144
"Mess"? I thought
you loved my wheat cakes.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.354
Mess? Mass.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.732
I meant "mass."
Of tastiness, admittedly.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.818
But now that
I'm all grown up,

03:54.818 --> 03:57.821
my priority is to keep you
healthy and happy.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.573
Well, all right.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.284
I suppose I could
get used to this.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.579
Yes. Now, off to school.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.873
Already? But it's only‐‐

04:07.873 --> 04:11.334
Cannot be late
for my first day back.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.588
"First day back"?

04:14.588 --> 04:19.968
<i>I must maintain a plausible</i>
<i>Parker impersonation</i>
<i>if I'm going to pull this off.</i>

04:19.968 --> 04:21.553
Hey, Pete.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.306
Yes! I am Peter Parker.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.433
That is absolutely correct.
[chuckles]

04:26.433 --> 04:28.351
Huh?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.396
<i>I think that went well.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:33.815
[students groan, grumble]

04:35.442 --> 04:37.402
[scoffs]
Does it count as pop quiz

04:37.402 --> 04:39.321
if it happens
almost every day?

04:46.369 --> 04:49.289
Don, I realize
"many worlds" theory

04:49.289 --> 04:52.250
is currently all the rage
with science fiction fans,

04:52.250 --> 04:54.628
but to rely on it
as actual evidence

04:54.628 --> 04:57.255
of quantum locality
is beneath you.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.257
This is a physics class.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.594
Please do not waste our time
with such fantasy.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.973
Hmph! Ridiculous.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.352
Hey, Pete!
Max is looking for you.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.270
[scoffs]
Modell?

05:12.270 --> 05:14.314
I am sure it is trivial.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.359
Tell him
I will catch up with him
when I have time.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.361
Uh, I'm not
your assistant, dude.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.948
Just passing the message.
What? Uh‐‐

05:22.948 --> 05:24.950
Oh, right.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.827
Sorry... dude.

05:26.827 --> 05:31.039
But the, uh, assistant thing
is a good‐‐ cool idea.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.667
Let me know if you think
of any suitable candidates.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.296
Is Pete getting
enough sleep?

05:38.296 --> 05:41.132
Don't know the answer to that,
but I do know this:

05:41.132 --> 05:45.262
in class just now,
he totally owned Dr. Lamaze
right to his face.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.473
Who knew Parker
could be so assertive?

05:48.473 --> 05:52.185
[man scoffs]
If I knew you'd be here,
I'd have stayed home.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.604
You got a lot of guts
showing your face!

05:54.604 --> 05:57.274
This some kind of trick?
Didn't think you'd be here.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.817
I got nothing
to say to you.
[whooshing sound]

06:00.485 --> 06:01.945
Knock it off!

06:01.945 --> 06:03.989
Any old beefs between gangs?

06:03.989 --> 06:07.075
Let 'em go, now!
Got it?

06:07.075 --> 06:09.286
I know some of you
were Hammerhead's guys,

06:09.286 --> 06:10.954
some of you worked
for Silvermane.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.873
Whatever.
They're gone now.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.251
Go back to your people
and you tell them
we all gotta come together.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.753
It's no secret Spider‐Man's
upped his game.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.756
But if we unite,
he can't beat us all.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.723
[scoffs, sighs]
Finally,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.350
the menial tasks
of the school day are over.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.728
Time to focus
on what really matters.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.939
<i>So, according to the thug</i>
<i>with the bad hygiene,</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:40.483
<i>Sandgirl's looking</i>
<i>to make a move, huh?</i>

06:40.483 --> 06:43.194
<i>What's her plan, I wonder?</i>

06:43.194 --> 06:47.407
<i>Perhaps my Spider‐Bots</i>
<i>captured clues in the drivel</i>
<i>of those half‐wits.</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.035
<i>Wait. What is that?</i>

06:51.911 --> 06:54.331
<i>Sandgirl was there</i>
<i>the entire time?!</i>

06:54.331 --> 06:56.499
<i>Now she's a step</i>
<i>ahead of me.</i>

06:56.499 --> 07:00.629
<i>Nothing escapes</i>
<i>my Spider‐Bot's keen eye.</i>

07:00.629 --> 07:05.300
<i>Sandgirl, where are you?</i>

07:05.300 --> 07:08.386
[beeps]
<i>Fire?</i>
<i>Convenience store holdup?</i>

07:08.386 --> 07:11.181
<i>Sorry. No Spider‐Man</i>
<i>for any of you today.</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:14.267
<i>I have got bigger fish to fry.</i>
<i>[line ringing]</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:17.187
Yes. I'd like to report
a fire and a robbery.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.731
Has anyone seen Pete?

07:19.731 --> 07:22.233
Get this. I told him
we were grabbing lunch,

07:22.233 --> 07:24.444
and he said he didn't
have time to chat with us.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.031
Then he told me
to bring him a PB&J,
like I'm his butler.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.116
After the disaster
at the open house,

07:30.116 --> 07:32.118
he's been taking things
real hard.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.746
I've seen Pete
mess up a lot of projects.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.539
Seems like it's more
than just that.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.085
Whatever it is,
hopefully he'll work through it.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.628
Give him time.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.841
[Peter sighs]
Busy! What is it?

07:46.841 --> 07:49.427
Just brought you a sandwich
that you, uh...

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
Not too much jelly, right?

07:54.224 --> 07:57.227
I mean, thanks... bro.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.145
Awesome!

08:00.563 --> 08:02.732
So not awesome.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.945
[Max]
Huh. Not sure
what this thing is.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.615
Hmm? Wasn't part
of the original
Neuro‐Cortex design.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.537
I'd hate to wipe you clean
if I can avoid it, old friend.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.957
So let's try a simple
virus scan first, huh?

08:18.957 --> 08:22.544
[sighs]
If only I could recognize
something in here.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.715
Uh‐oh. Those I recognize.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.385
The security nodes Miles,
Anya, and Gwen created
for the Neuro‐Cortex.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.471
Good news is,
I know where I am now.
Bad news is‐‐

Great!

08:41.479 --> 08:43.857

Technically,
I'm an electrical intruder
in an electrical world.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.767
These security nodes
wouldn't be able to
detect me otherwise.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.686
Which might mean...

09:21.686 --> 09:23.313
[grunts]
Yes!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.648
I'm electrically active

What was it?

Huh, you're sicker

Guess I have no choice
but a hard reset then.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.635
Even if this sector survives,
I still gotta find
a way out somehow.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.683
[beeps]

12:05.683 --> 12:07.685
<i>Miles Morales following me.</i>

12:07.685 --> 12:09.687
<i>Such a good heart.</i>
<i>[sighs]</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.941
<i>But I cannot be bothered</i>
<i>with him right now.</i>

12:12.941 --> 12:15.485
<i>Let us use his heart</i>
<i>against him.</i>

12:17.487 --> 12:21.866
Spider‐Bots, bring up
possible disturbances
in the vicinity.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.911
Hm. No. No.
Too trivial.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.913
Ah. Perfect.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.752
Help! Spider‐Man!
[creaking]

12:32.752 --> 12:35.672
Help!

12:35.672 --> 12:40.051
Just passed him by?
No way he did that!

12:40.051 --> 12:43.638
<i>That should</i>
<i>keep him occupied.</i>

12:45.139 --> 12:47.517
[Sandgirl]
Everybody here chose wisely.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.894
Spider‐Man thinks
he can shut us down.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.481
We're gonna show him
he can't beat
all of us together.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.066
[grunts]

12:55.066 --> 12:58.194
And who's gonna
lead us? You?

12:58.194 --> 13:02.865
That's right.
No one hates Spider‐Man
more than I do.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.952
That web‐head helped
my traitorous father,

13:05.952 --> 13:08.371
then he took down my mentor,
Hammerhead.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.792
The hatred for Spider‐Man
courses through
every grain of my body.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
Who else here
can say the same?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.423
Hmph!

13:18.423 --> 13:21.259
Plus, I was in
that warehouse he hit.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.803
I've seen Spider‐Man's
new tactics firsthand.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
We can handle him.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.933
It's time for the prey
to become the predators.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.811
Aw, you betcha that's what
we oughta do.
Sandgirl's right.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.604
[laughing]

13:33.604 --> 13:37.275
But ya gotta admit,
Spider‐Man's not
the same guy anymore.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.987
He's different now.
More, like, vengeful.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.488
[laughs]

13:42.488 --> 13:44.490
Guys, he's a kid

13:44.490 --> 13:47.035
pretending to be a superhero.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.037
We're gonna crush him,

13:49.037 --> 13:52.040
with me at the head
of this organization‐‐

13:52.040 --> 13:54.333
[Superior Spider‐Man]
You will be doomed.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.672
You thought you could
outsmart me, Sandgirl.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.467
Please.
You embarrass yourself.
[chuckles]

14:02.467 --> 14:03.718
[beeps]

14:05.136 --> 14:06.137
What?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.934
Oh, you're smart,
Spider‐Man.
But that's your problem.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.270
I knew you'd figure out
a way to track me here.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.814
In fact,
I was counting on it.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.567
You think mere steel can‐‐
[cries out]

14:21.069 --> 14:23.946
Anyone else doubt I can
lead this organization?

14:23.946 --> 14:26.657
[men cheering, laughing]
[man]
All right! Let's do this!

14:26.657 --> 14:29.619
[crying out]

14:32.955 --> 14:34.957
[men laughing]

14:34.957 --> 14:36.709
What's wrong,
Spider‐Man?
[beeps]

14:36.709 --> 14:38.753
[crying out]

14:39.921 --> 14:41.881
[grunts, sighs]

14:41.881 --> 14:45.384
<i>Ahh! My web‐shooters! Fried!</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:49.764
<i>Think, Otto, or the realization</i>
<i>you've been defeated by a child</i>

14:49.764 --> 14:51.933
<i>will be the last thought</i>
<i>you ever have!</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:55.311
Spidey's been acting
real strange.

14:55.311 --> 14:59.065
But getting himself
into big trouble
with a super‐villain?

14:59.065 --> 15:01.275
Now, this is the Spidey I know!

15:03.277 --> 15:04.278
[grunts]

15:04.278 --> 15:06.572
Aah!
Aah!

15:06.572 --> 15:08.157
Thank you!

15:08.157 --> 15:10.159
[yells]

15:13.955 --> 15:17.125
Too little too late,
Knock‐Off Spider.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.044
[chuckles]
Two Spider‐Men in one night.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.673
Our gang's getting off
to a better start
than even I imagined.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.259
We're not done yet!
[beeps]

15:30.096 --> 15:32.306
You dare cage me?!

15:32.306 --> 15:33.891
Attack!

15:38.437 --> 15:40.148
What a coincidence.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.817
I just issued
the same command.
[beeps]

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
[men gasp]

15:47.947 --> 15:50.908
[men cry out]

15:50.908 --> 15:53.161
Ugh!
[growls]

15:53.161 --> 15:54.537
[grunts]

15:57.540 --> 15:59.000
[Sandgirl yells]

15:59.000 --> 16:00.334
[grunts]

16:00.334 --> 16:03.421
[scoffs]
No webs. This will have to do.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.047
Whoa!

16:06.632 --> 16:09.177
Metal versus sand?
Bring it, bug!

16:13.472 --> 16:15.349
[laughs]

16:15.349 --> 16:18.895
I am guessing
you have not realized
what you have just done.

16:18.895 --> 16:19.937
Pity.
[beeps]

16:21.439 --> 16:25.151
Electric heat
plus sand equals...
Aaahhh!

16:25.151 --> 16:26.903
glass.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.990
Why, Sandgirl,
it appears

16:30.990 --> 16:34.702
as if you have
a glass jaw.
[grunts]

16:34.702 --> 16:36.954
What are you doing?
Let the police arrest her.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.664
We don't shatter
villains to pieces.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.458
Get your hands off of me!

16:40.458 --> 16:42.210
Let this be a lesson

16:42.210 --> 16:46.130
to whoever stands
in Spider‐Man's way.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.636
Spidey,
what's happened to you?

16:54.263 --> 16:57.058
<i>[computer]</i>
<i>Shutdown 97% complete.</i>

16:57.058 --> 16:59.852
<i>Commencing flash</i>
<i>storage deletion.</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:03.022
[beeping]

17:03.022 --> 17:04.732
What?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.068
I thought this place
was going to be safe!

17:07.068 --> 17:10.029
I've got nowhere else to go!
[panting]

17:12.657 --> 17:14.867
[grunts]

17:18.204 --> 17:20.206
[grunting]

17:24.418 --> 17:26.212
[panting]

17:27.296 --> 17:29.215
Aah!
[panting]

17:29.215 --> 17:33.094
Gotta be a way
to stop this!

17:33.094 --> 17:36.013
[pants]
What's that?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.432
No time to figure it out.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.483
Ock! Did he have
a Trojan horse program
running on the Neuro‐Cortex?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.235
An escape access point
outta here?

17:49.235 --> 17:52.071
<i>[Doc Ock computerized voice]</i>
<i>Password not recognized.</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:55.491
What's Ock's password?
Uh, uh...

17:55.491 --> 17:57.285
Eight, eight, eight!

17:57.285 --> 17:59.787
<i>Password not recognized.</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:01.789
Super‐villain for life!

18:01.789 --> 18:04.584
<i>Password not recognized.</i>

18:05.626 --> 18:08.129
Aah! I hate Spider‐Man?

18:08.129 --> 18:09.672
[beeps]

18:09.672 --> 18:11.090
Really?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.134
[panting]

18:24.103 --> 18:27.398
All done.
Whatever was making you sick,

18:27.398 --> 18:29.400
it's all gone now.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.908
[grunts, yells]

18:39.577 --> 18:42.830
Okay. Out of the frying pan
and into the...

18:43.956 --> 18:45.207
Where?

18:48.336 --> 18:50.129
"HNS."

18:50.129 --> 18:52.298
I'm in the Horizon
Network System!

18:52.298 --> 18:55.801
This must be how Doc
got his message out
to Chameleon to attack me.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.470
Which means...

19:03.225 --> 19:05.269
...from in here,
there might be a way

19:05.269 --> 19:07.313
to communicate
with someone at Horizon!

19:11.317 --> 19:13.277
Here goes nothing.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.950
[thunderclap]

19:24.413 --> 19:26.624
[knocking]
Whoa!

19:26.624 --> 19:28.709
What do you want?

19:30.419 --> 19:34.215
You have the means.
It is time for you
to spread the message.

19:34.215 --> 19:38.344
Stop wasting your influence
on your petty vilification
of me.

19:38.344 --> 19:42.139
Either get on board
with fumigating this city
of its criminal vermin,

19:42.139 --> 19:45.142
or get out of my way.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.478
You can't just waltz in here
and threaten me!

19:47.478 --> 19:49.397
I just did.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.899
This city needs to know
what I stand for now,

19:51.899 --> 19:54.360
and you will be
my messenger.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.409
They're right about you.
You have changed, Spider‐Man.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.703
And I like it.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.252
[Max]
Now, let's just hope
for a graceful reboot.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.964
I received your latest
pestering summons.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.259
You have three minutes.
Make it worth my time.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.303
You're, uh, clearly

20:21.303 --> 20:24.724
under a lot of stress
lately, Peter,
and I hate to add to it.

20:24.724 --> 20:29.478
But your tuition payment is,
at this point,
unacceptably overdue.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.355
[scoffs]
Is that all?

20:31.355 --> 20:33.357
Well, the solution
would appear to be obvious,

20:33.357 --> 20:35.818
even to an overrated mind
like yours.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.240
Give me a scholarship.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.452
I am a brilliant student
and an asset to the school.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.039
I'm afraid it doesn't
work that way.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.375
Maybe we can come up
with a payment plan that‐‐

20:51.375 --> 20:55.463
I have never had to
pay tuition in my life!

20:55.463 --> 20:58.174
Peter, of course you have.
What is wrong with‐‐

20:58.174 --> 21:00.176
Do not contradict me!

21:00.176 --> 21:03.179
The point is, that Horizon
should be paying me
for the prestige

21:03.179 --> 21:05.222
my presence brings
to this place!
[slurping]

21:05.222 --> 21:07.433
Whoa, whoa, Pete!

21:07.433 --> 21:09.226
What in the world
is going on with you?

21:09.226 --> 21:13.063
This is the second time
you have stayed my hand.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.316
There will not
be a third.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.279
Horizon is not what made me.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.825
Any school I attend
will be the superior school
for having me in it.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.995
Consider Horizon
off that list.

21:27.995 --> 21:28.996
I quit!
