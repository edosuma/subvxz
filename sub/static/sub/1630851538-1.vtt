00:17.308 --> 00:20.478
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.647
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.731 --> 00:26.359
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.364
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.953
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
-A scary tale.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.206
-A strange tale.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.709
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.880
-You really think you can handle it?

00:51.259 --> 00:52.677
You've been warned.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.263
Don't blame me if you can't sleep tonight.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.767
All right then, you're weird.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.560
You might as well settle in.

01:00.643 --> 01:04.147
It's time for A Tale Dark and Grimm.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.358
I don't know.
So far the story is not that awesome.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.569
Come on, he hasn't even started yet.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.322
Let's dive right in, shall we?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.115
Once upon a time,

01:14.199 --> 01:17.452
in the kingdom of Grimm,
there were two children…

01:25.543 --> 01:26.669
Hansel…

01:26.753 --> 01:29.214
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.387
Gotcha!

01:37.263 --> 01:38.431
Huh.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.850
-Boo!

01:40.934 --> 01:41.851
Ah!

01:41.935 --> 01:42.894
…and Gretel.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.524
You probably think you know their story.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.193
I don't think you do. Not the real story.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.571
-Never heard of them.
-They lived with their mother, the Queen…

01:53.655 --> 01:55.115
Story time.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.866
…and their father, the King.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.993
I'm the dragon!

02:00.453 --> 02:03.123
Their parents
loved them very much.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.875
They were a happy, little family.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.586
Until the dragon came.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.506
I'll protect you.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.802
Don't worry, it's only a story.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.948
Which is why
it was fairly surprising…

02:46.374 --> 02:49.460
…when their father cut off their heads.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.964
Whoa, whoa! You can't tell
that part of the story, William.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.549
There are kids out there.

02:54.632 --> 02:58.428
I mean, look at that one over there.
How old could you be? Seven?

02:58.511 --> 03:01.472
How else is he gonna learn
what's inside a person's neck?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.099
It's mostly blood.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.934
We're gonna show it.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.477
Tastefully!

03:11.858 --> 03:13.484
Aha! Ha!

03:14.068 --> 03:15.778
Ha! Ah.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.989
-What? Too soon?

03:18.573 --> 03:22.577
You might think that this was the end
of the tale of Hansel and Gretel.

03:22.660 --> 03:27.624
-In fact, it was just the beginning.
-Is this really going to work?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.543
It will. It has to!

03:30.627 --> 03:33.004
-And… done.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.841
So, up and at 'em.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.218
-Oh.
-Here you go.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.387
-Oh…
-Gretel? Hansel? Please!

03:41.471 --> 03:45.308
Oh, how could we ever have
believed this would bring them back?

03:45.391 --> 03:46.935
What have we done?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.605
-What?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.565
-Ah!

03:54.609 --> 03:56.527
-Phew.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.738
Children, you're…

03:58.821 --> 03:59.697
awake!

03:59.781 --> 04:03.910
So, who wants chocolate cake?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.916
-I guess a slice would be--

04:09.999 --> 04:11.584
No, thank you, Father.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.919
-But Gretel…

04:13.002 --> 04:16.839
We're very tired, and also we don't
remember what happened just now,

04:16.923 --> 04:18.383
in case you were wondering.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.677
-I think we'll just go to bed.
-I'm not tired.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.513
-Good night. Love you guys. Sleep well.

04:26.516 --> 04:30.478
-It worked. It really worked.
-Do you think they noticed anything?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.105
-Hurry, Hansel.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.815
We have to get out of here.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
-Why would they do that?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.112
Don't they love us anymore?

04:39.696 --> 04:41.990
You don't cut off the heads
of things you love.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.119
You do with flowers.
We must have done something bad.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.871
-Something really bad.

04:49.372 --> 04:53.835
This isn't because of us.
It's them. They're awful, evil!

04:55.795 --> 04:59.007
Parents shouldn't slay their children.
Not even once.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.759
I-- I shouldn't even have to say that.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.768
Hansel, we have to get out of here.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
But where are we gonna go?

05:12.854 --> 05:15.773
I don't know,
but we'll figure it out, together.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.193
Will it be an adventure?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.529
-That I can promise.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.615
And don't worry,
I will always protect my little brother.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.533
No.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.330
-I'll protect you.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.750
And I'm not your little brother.
You're only two minutes older than me.

05:33.833 --> 05:34.876
Almost three.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.711
Do you trust me?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.338
Let's do it.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.090
-Adventure!

05:41.174 --> 05:45.219
-Oh, no.
-They're coming. Come! Quick!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.808
Rug! Now!

05:52.518 --> 05:53.853
-Come on.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.526
-Ah!
-What did you tie the other end to?

06:03.946 --> 06:04.781
Whoa.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.074
Whoa.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.290
This… is going to be fine.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.220
Who's that weirdo?
Why is he wearing a cloak?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.971
This is supposed to be…

06:29.055 --> 06:31.516
-…mysterious.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.186
Scared and confused,
Hansel and Gretel made their way

06:35.269 --> 06:36.813
through the quiet village.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.451
Gretel, what are we gonna do?

06:51.202 --> 06:52.036
Trust me.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.287
I have a plan.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.292
We are going to find
better parents, perfect parents.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.711
Like ones who won't kill us so much?

07:00.795 --> 07:01.838
Exactly.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.591
Okay, you know that woman
who delivers bread to the castle?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
The one who always
gives us chocolate cake?

07:07.718 --> 07:08.678
Mrs. Baker?

07:08.761 --> 07:11.848
I was thinking
she'd make a perfect new mother.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.225
Yeah. Chocolate cake is like love.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.477
Mom and Dad
used to give us chocolate cake.

07:16.561 --> 07:21.399
-Do you think they still loved us then?
-I don't know, Hansel. Now, look…

07:23.651 --> 07:25.570
Mrs. Baker lives right here.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.989
Uh, what's this we have to go through?

07:28.531 --> 07:32.034
It says, "deep dark woods."

07:37.999 --> 07:39.750
Maybe we should go back home.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.712
If we just knew why Mom and Dad
did what they did, maybe--

07:42.795 --> 07:45.631
Hansel, do you really want
to get your head cut off again?

07:45.715 --> 07:46.799
Just do what I do.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.885
Take all your feelings
and put them in a box.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.053
-Lock and bury it and set fire to it.
-What?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.139
-Okay.
-Never think about them again.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.641
How can I set fire
to the box after I buried it?

07:56.225 --> 08:00.605
Hansel! We are going to find
the perfect parents whatever it takes.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.898
And then…

08:04.066 --> 08:06.152
Mom and Dad will be sorry.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.864
Let's go. Stay close.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.409
Uh… Uh…

08:19.123 --> 08:22.126
And so
Hansel and Gretel made their way

08:22.210 --> 08:24.629
through the deep dark woods

08:24.712 --> 08:28.049
-to find the perfect family.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.639
One of us.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.098
Who's there?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.558
I'm armed!

08:38.142 --> 08:40.603
-Ah!
-One of us.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.438
D-did you hear that?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.106
It's-- It's just the wind.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.900
Wait!

08:51.781 --> 08:53.866
-Bats!

08:55.076 --> 08:56.827
They're in my hair! Get them off me!

08:56.911 --> 08:58.037
Shoo! Get out of here.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.249
Gross. One of them kissed me!

09:03.209 --> 09:06.796
Okay, we have to find somewhere
we can rest for the night.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.256
It's too dark to go on.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.391
-Look. It's glowing.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.350
Whoa.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.064
This is crazy!

09:25.147 --> 09:28.442
Sewing someone's head back on
should not bring them back to life.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.820
It's some kind of magic thread.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.905
Modern medicine is amazing.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.329
Gretel, I have a bad feeling
about this place.

09:43.291 --> 09:47.086
Just a thought, instead of resting,
we could keep walking forever and ever

09:47.169 --> 09:49.964
and please, please not stop
in the deep dark woods.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.466
-No. We need rest.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.179
And Hansel, I know you can keep me safe.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.149
-Okay, I can do this.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.066
Yeah.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.862
All I've gotta do
is keep my eyes wide open…

10:12.945 --> 10:15.823
…all night long.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.958
One of us.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.256
Wolves.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.763
Gretel? Gretel?

10:40.556 --> 10:42.642
Would you rather die
awake or in your sleep?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
Why would you ask?

10:46.312 --> 10:47.563
In my sleep.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.564
Too late!

10:53.319 --> 10:55.529
-Stay back! Stay back!

10:55.613 --> 10:57.073
Take this!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.450
I'm sorry I got us into this!

10:59.533 --> 11:02.328
If I have to die again,
I'm glad it's with you.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.206
Wait, did that sound like
I'm glad you're dying?

11:05.289 --> 11:06.916
I wasn't paying attention!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.626
Stay away! I'm warning you!

11:10.211 --> 11:11.587
Uh-oh.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.423
-Run!

11:26.060 --> 11:27.478
That way!

11:41.283 --> 11:42.702
We gotta get across.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.290
I can't do it! I can't do it!

11:48.374 --> 11:51.210
-You have to. Take my hand!

12:08.769 --> 12:10.229
-Come on!

12:10.312 --> 12:12.481
-Help me!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.240
-Ha-ha!

12:21.323 --> 12:23.492
-Oh no.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.498
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-Ah!

12:32.334 --> 12:34.170
Bad day to be a wolf.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.716
-Hmm.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.552
-Wow!
-You two all right?

12:42.094 --> 12:46.056
Those wolves will take a piece of you
if you give 'em half a chance.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.434
Here. You must be freezin'.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.311
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.481
Sir? We're looking for a Mrs. Baker.

12:53.564 --> 12:57.777
Oh, yeah. Yeah, her cottage
is a day's walk that way.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.944
You can't miss it.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.155
Uh, are you two kids alone?

13:01.781 --> 13:05.993
I'm only asking 'cause you look
like you need a place to stay.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.205
We've got plenty of room
on the farm for the both of you

13:09.288 --> 13:11.499
and plenty of turnips.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.710
Hansel, a turnip farmer.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.587
Or a cake baker.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.634
We have a winner.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.011
-No, thank you, sir.
-But we appreciate your help.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.513
Oh, that's too bad.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.100
We'll be there, if you change your minds.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.018
Yee!

13:31.101 --> 13:32.478
Thanks. Bye.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.562
See ya.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.031
Hansel and Gretel continued on

13:44.114 --> 13:47.409
unaware that they were being followed by

13:48.536 --> 13:50.287
-him.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.425
A day later,
Hansel and Gretel emerged from the forest

14:03.509 --> 14:09.139
exhausted and hungrier
than they had ever been in their lives.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.057
Mmm!

14:10.140 --> 14:14.311
You want some turnip sack?
The sweaty part is salty and good.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.822
Mm-mm-mmm!

14:24.905 --> 14:27.867
Hansel, are you seeing what I'm seeing?

14:27.950 --> 14:31.453
-Is that… a cake-house?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.372
I'm going to find out.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.915
With my mouth!

14:42.381 --> 14:44.008
-Mmm.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.260
Mmm. Mmm.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.304
Ha-ha!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.349
-Mmm. Mmm.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.559
Children!

14:57.354 --> 15:00.941
-Oh, I just love…

15:01.525 --> 15:03.861
-…children!

15:07.781 --> 15:11.410
-Try the fence, my widdle sugar-puffs.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.371
-It's peppermint candy cane!

15:14.455 --> 15:16.415
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.418
Thank you, ma'am. I'm sorry we screamed.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.712
-We thought you were gonna chop us up.
-Hansel!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.172
Chop you up? Why?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.800
I love children.

15:26.884 --> 15:30.471
-They're so… sweet.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.015
Oh, give me a break.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.645
I know we're doing
a "Is she nice or is she evil?" thing,

15:37.728 --> 15:38.938
but come on!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.606
Everyone knows this story.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.317
She's a witch who eats children.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.780
What's wrong with that?
Children are so sweet and juicy.

15:47.863 --> 15:48.989
She's not a witch.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.408
She is a perfectly ordinary woman

15:51.992 --> 15:53.410
who eats children.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.080
You see, once she had a child of her own.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.874
And she did what parents so often do…

15:58.958 --> 15:59.959
Oh…

16:00.042 --> 16:02.753
…look at you, you are so sweet.

16:02.836 --> 16:07.257
But she took it just a little bit farther.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.594
I could just eat you right up,
yes, I could.

16:10.678 --> 16:14.139
-Ooh, oh, I could… just eat you up.

16:15.140 --> 16:19.269
Thus, her beloved child
became several rather delicious pies.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.730
And once you've developed
a taste for children…

16:37.621 --> 16:39.415
…it's a hard habit to give up.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.421
Come in, sweet ones. Come, come, come.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.630
Stay for dinner.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.425
-Stay as long as you like.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.926
Stay forever.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.012
Sit.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.725
Let me bring you a little snack.
You must be hungry.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.020
What brings you to my little cottage,
my sweethearts?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.646
Our parents chopped our heads off.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.232
-Really? How inconsiderate. Ha!

17:05.315 --> 17:09.028
We're looking for the perfect family.
Or at least one that won't kill us.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.698
And will let us eat chocolate cake
whenever we want.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.491
And never make us do chores.

17:14.575 --> 17:18.495
Well, I have some…
…cake for you now!

17:18.579 --> 17:22.332
And just about everything
you could ever desire.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.960
How's that for a happily ever after?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.505
Ma'am, may we eat like animals?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.840
You do you, baby.

17:37.139 --> 17:41.435
Hansel and Gretel had found
something to replace their parents' love:

17:41.518 --> 17:42.352
food.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.938
-Really just a lot of food.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.356
-Eat up.
-Mmm.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.235
This. That. Some of this.
Some of that. Eat my sweets.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.075
Mmm. Yeah.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.660
She must really love us, right?

18:00.120 --> 18:00.996
Yeah.

18:01.997 --> 18:05.375
Remember when Mom and Dad
played hide-and-seek with us?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.378
Do you think
they still loved us then?

18:09.171 --> 18:11.340
I don't know, Hansel.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.550
We have Mrs. Baker now.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.552
Everything is fine.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.555
Here you go, my sugar plums.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.973
Eat those pies up…

18:29.149 --> 18:30.692
-Ooh!

18:34.404 --> 18:38.033
Oh, look at my sweepy widdle muffins.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.911
Come, I have a lovely room ready for you

18:40.994 --> 18:43.330
with great, soft beds.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.007
Good night, sleep tight.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.051
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.177
Not until you're…

18:58.303 --> 18:59.179
ripe.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.683
We did it, Hansel.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.435
-We found the perfect family.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.314
And she's so pretty.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.693
I love her so much.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.576
How come is the closet
full of children's shoes?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.745
Eh… Kids are always losing things.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.498
That one has a foot in it.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.084
-A little foot leg.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.253
Don't worry about it.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.005
It's fine.

19:33.088 --> 19:37.176
My plan worked perfect
and everything's fine.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.306
If you say so.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.017
Good night.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.231
Wakey wakey.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.067
-Foody-oot. Food, food.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.903
Nom nom nom nom.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.196
-Yay!
-Food!

19:57.279 --> 20:01.533
-Mmm. Yes. Eat up, little piggies, eat up!

20:01.617 --> 20:05.204
Those ham hocks
ain't gonna fatten themselves.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.791
Digesting so much food
took a lot of energy.

20:09.875 --> 20:14.546
After a while this left very little energy
for Hansel and Gretel's brains.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.342
That was when Mrs. Baker decided…

20:18.425 --> 20:20.427
-…they were ripe.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.267
Oh, Hansel.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.228
Is that you, food?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.980
I need your help
in the kitchen, honey pie.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.149
-Okay.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.444
-There's food there, right?
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.406
Be a lamb and get in the oven

20:41.490 --> 20:45.744
and tell me when it's hot enough
to bake you and your sister, will you?

20:45.827 --> 20:48.497
-There's a widdle boofy-woops.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.083
How will I know when it's hot enough?

20:52.459 --> 20:53.335
You'll die.

20:55.045 --> 20:55.879
Oh.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.924
-Hey.
-Yes?

20:59.007 --> 21:02.052
If I'm dead,
how will I tell you it's hot enough?

21:02.719 --> 21:04.846
I'll smell you cooking.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.057
M'kay.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.481
-Whew, boy, whew.

21:16.483 --> 21:20.028
Wow. Something smells delicious.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.447
Huh.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.117
It's me that smells delicious.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.040
Oh, it's just you, pocket pork chop.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.045
Wait a second.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.839
Dying is bad!

21:39.423 --> 21:40.966
No! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

21:41.967 --> 21:43.260
Ow!

21:44.386 --> 21:47.723
How are you doing in there,
my widdle dumpwing?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.767
Uh-- Uh, just fine. Nearly done now.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.313
I don't smell you yet!

21:55.439 --> 21:58.233
Hansel hardly
had any brainpower left.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.695
But he had just enough to trick Mrs. Baker

22:01.778 --> 22:04.281
into opening the oven door.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.492
There it is.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.536
My dear little piggie.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.038
Oink, oink.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.791
-Huh?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.252
-Heads up! Ha! Get baked!

22:17.336 --> 22:18.545
No! No!

22:18.628 --> 22:22.007
-You ungrateful little swine!

22:22.090 --> 22:24.676
-Gretel, wake up! We have to go!

22:24.760 --> 22:25.635
Food?

22:25.719 --> 22:28.930
-She tried to cook me! We have to go!
-Wait. What's going on?

22:32.559 --> 22:36.980
Oven… doors… don't… lock!

22:45.989 --> 22:47.699
Sweeties!

22:49.201 --> 22:50.452
Hansel?

22:51.286 --> 22:52.871
Hansel!

22:54.706 --> 22:59.169
Do you really want to know
when your parents stopped loving you?

22:59.252 --> 23:01.463
The answer is quite simple.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.257
Obvious, really.

23:06.551 --> 23:10.764
They never loved you. Never. Never. Never.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.808
You know it's true.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.231
-Ah! Ha-ha!

23:19.314 --> 23:22.359
-Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

23:22.442 --> 23:23.944
Eat this!

23:24.403 --> 23:26.196
-Oh! Agh! Whoa!

23:26.279 --> 23:27.406
Agh!

23:30.909 --> 23:34.121
-Um, maybe she's okay?

23:34.204 --> 23:36.706
-Uh…
-Maybe she's okay.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.253
Oh, she is not okay.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.716
Mmm. Candy canes never looked so good.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.677
Would you please just…

23:48.760 --> 23:50.387
Forget it.

23:50.470 --> 23:54.224
Can we just check in on the children
who are watching this right now?

23:54.307 --> 23:56.560
Are you guys all okay out there?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.812
How about that little kid? You.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.313
You're still here?

24:00.397 --> 24:03.191
A woman just got impaled
on a peppermint stick.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.485
Why would he not leave?

24:05.569 --> 24:06.486
I give up.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.029
I like that kid.

24:08.613 --> 24:13.535
And so Hansel and Gretel got far away
from that place as quickly as they could.

24:18.498 --> 24:22.169
It's true, isn't it?
Mom and Dad never loved us.

24:22.252 --> 24:26.840
But that means we did the right thing.
We just didn't pick the right parent.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.176
That's the reason my plan didn't work.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.804
-We need someone more down to earth.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.973
Like that farmer!

24:35.056 --> 24:37.684
Nothing's more down to earth than turnips.

24:37.767 --> 24:41.062
We can do this.
We can find a better family.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.857
A perfect family. Are you with me?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.484
We're never going back.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.652
It's you and me forever.

25:00.790 --> 25:04.711
-Hello.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.880
We meet again.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.341
Unfortunately.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.096
Two children were here,

25:15.180 --> 25:18.391
two unusual children.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.477
They are mine.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.897
Oh, you can have them, for now.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.774
That's not what I'm here for.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.193
Oh, yes, you should carry on.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.403
Ta-ta.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.073
Have a fantabulous trip.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.410
Um, hello? H-- Hello?

25:38.286 --> 25:39.287
So, wait.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.290
-What's going on here?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.251
Nothing good.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.879
Me? Wait, no.
But I'm-- But I'm not ripe yet.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.258
No. But you are done.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.093
-Ha.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.594
Ooh!

25:54.678 --> 25:55.595
Nailed it.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.850
Under a sunny sky,

26:00.934 --> 26:03.728
Hansel and Gretel
arrived at the turnip farm.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.523
That farmer seemed like a no-nonsense guy.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.733
I'm sure he'll be completely normal.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.361
Not weird at all.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.409
Hello, children.

26:19.494 --> 26:20.745
This is fine.
