00:19.791 --> 00:21.026
WELCOME, ONCE AGAIN,

00:21.092 --> 00:22.027
TO OUR SHOW, STILL TAKING PLACE

00:22.093 --> 00:23.962
INSIDE THIS WHITE VOID.

00:24.029 --> 00:25.397
HONESTLY, I'VE BEEN CALLING IT

00:25.463 --> 00:27.265
A WHITE VOID, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

00:27.332 --> 00:29.467
JUST THIS ZOOMED IN PICTURE OF

00:29.534 --> 00:29.801
SNOOPY'S DICK.

00:36.474 --> 00:37.709
IT'S CLEARLY BEEN A VERY BUSY

BERNIE SANDERS DROPPED OUT OF

00:44.449 --> 00:47.986
AND THE CORONAVIRUS CONTINUED

00:48.053 --> 00:48.553
TO CAUSE WIDESPREAD HAVOC,

00:48.620 --> 00:49.955
INCLUDING FORCING SOME OF US TO

DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULTIES OF

00:51.089 --> 00:52.924
WORKING AT HOME ‐‐ AS THIS

00:52.991 --> 00:54.492
LOCAL NEWS REPORTER LEARNED WHEN

00:54.559 --> 00:55.126
HIS CAT PULLED FOCUS DURING

A LIVE SHOT.

TRAFFIC DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS

01:09.207 --> 01:09.407
PANDEMIC.

01:09.474 --> 01:10.475
>> John: I WAS ‐‐ AND THIS IS

01:10.542 --> 01:12.010
TRUE ‐‐ NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO

01:12.077 --> 01:13.578
A SINGLE WORD THAT MAN JUST

01:13.645 --> 01:14.579
SAID.

01:14.646 --> 01:15.780
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE BROKE

01:15.847 --> 01:17.449
THE CARDINAL RULE OF BROADCAST

01:17.515 --> 01:19.351
JOURNALISM: NEVER REPORT THE

01:19.417 --> 01:21.419
NEWS WHILE SITTING NEXT TO A CAT

01:21.486 --> 01:23.989
WHO'S MAKING A FIVE‐COURSE MEAL

01:24.055 --> 01:24.556
OUT OF ITS OWN ASSHOLE.

01:24.622 --> 01:25.957
I HOPE THE STORY HE WAS TRYING

01:26.024 --> 01:27.826
TO BREAK WAS ABOUT HOW HIS CAT'S

01:27.892 --> 01:29.327
BUTTHOLE IS CLEAN AS A WHISTLE,

01:29.394 --> 01:29.928
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THE

01:29.995 --> 01:33.164
INFORMATION I GOT FROM THAT.

01:33.231 --> 01:33.798
THAT CLIP ACTUALLY POINTS TO OUR

01:33.865 --> 01:35.333
MAIN STORY, THOUGH, TONIGHT,

01:35.400 --> 01:37.402
WHICH IS HOW THE CORONAVIRUS HAS

01:37.469 --> 01:37.802
IMPACTED WORKERS.

01:37.869 --> 01:39.070
NOT SO MUCH THOSE WHO ARE LUCKY

01:39.137 --> 01:40.505
ENOUGH ‐‐ LIKE THAT MAN, THAT

01:40.572 --> 01:42.073
CAT, AND OUR STAFF ‐‐ TO BE ABLE

01:42.140 --> 01:43.074
TO WORK FROM HOME.

01:43.141 --> 01:45.443
THAT'S SOMETHING ONLY AROUND

01:45.510 --> 01:46.511
A THIRD OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE

01:46.578 --> 01:48.813
TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.415
INSTEAD, I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

01:50.482 --> 01:52.684
TWO GROUPS: THE UNEMPLOYED, AND

01:52.751 --> 01:54.152
THOSE CURRENTLY HAVING TO LEAVE

01:54.219 --> 01:56.287
THE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY WORK

01:56.354 --> 01:56.688
"ESSENTIAL JOBS."

01:56.755 --> 01:57.455
BECAUSE EACH IS FACING

01:57.522 --> 01:58.656
A DIFFERENT SET OF CHALLENGES.

01:58.723 --> 01:59.824
AND LET'S START WITH

01:59.891 --> 02:01.192
THE UNEMPLOYED.

02:01.259 --> 02:03.595
MORE THAN ONE IN TEN WORKERS

02:03.661 --> 02:05.530
HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE PAST

02:05.597 --> 02:06.765
THREE WEEKS.

02:06.831 --> 02:08.033
THOSE ARE STAGGERING NUMBERS.

02:08.099 --> 02:09.901
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:09.968 --> 02:11.703
TAKING SOME BIG STEPS TO PROTECT

02:11.770 --> 02:13.838
THOSE PEOPLE AND TRY AND SLOW

02:13.905 --> 02:15.040
JOB LOSS.

02:15.106 --> 02:17.409
UNFORTUNATELY, THE EXECUTION HAS

02:17.475 --> 02:18.376
BEEN LESS THAN IDEAL.

02:18.443 --> 02:20.078
TAKE THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION

02:20.145 --> 02:21.946
PROGRAM, WHICH OFFERS LOANS

02:22.013 --> 02:23.515
OF UP TO $10 MILLION TO

02:23.581 --> 02:25.083
SMALL BUSINESSES, LOANS WHICH

02:25.150 --> 02:26.618
DON'T HAVE TO BE REPAID IF

02:26.684 --> 02:27.652
THEY KEEP THEIR WORKERS

02:27.719 --> 02:29.821
ON THE PAYROLL.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.556
TO HEAR TRUMP TELL IT, THE

02:31.623 --> 02:33.558
ROLLOUT HAS BEEN PRETTY GREAT!

02:33.625 --> 02:34.692
>> IT'S REALLY A TRIBUTE TO

02:34.759 --> 02:38.063
GOVERNMENT ‐‐ REALLY WELL‐RUN

02:38.129 --> 02:38.930
GOVERNMENT.

02:38.997 --> 02:39.497
AND THERE ARE FEW GLITCHES.

02:39.564 --> 02:41.566
VERY FEW.

02:41.633 --> 02:42.167
ANY LITTLE GLITCH, WE HAD

02:42.233 --> 02:43.334
WORKED OUT WITHIN MINUTES,

02:43.401 --> 02:45.136
WITHIN HOURS.

02:45.203 --> 02:45.703
I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE

02:45.770 --> 02:46.371
EVERYBODY.

02:46.438 --> 02:49.474
THIS HAS BECOME SO POPULAR.

02:49.541 --> 02:51.342
>> John: THAT IS CLASSIC TRUMP,

02:51.409 --> 02:53.311
TO TRY AND BRAG ABOUT HOW

02:53.378 --> 02:53.912
IN‐DEMAND AN EMERGENCY BAILOUT

02:53.978 --> 02:55.146
SYSTEM IS.

02:55.213 --> 02:56.748
IF HE WAS CAPTAIN OF

02:56.815 --> 02:57.916
THE TITANIC, YOU JUST KNOW HE'D

02:57.982 --> 02:59.350
BE SAYING, "I JUST WANT TO

02:59.417 --> 03:00.351
CONGRATULATE EVERYONE.

03:00.418 --> 03:01.519
THESE LIFEBOATS HAVE BECOME

03:01.586 --> 03:02.654
SO POPULAR!

03:02.720 --> 03:04.889
A FEW WEEKS AGO ‐‐ NOTHING.

03:04.956 --> 03:05.390
NOW THEY'RE MOVING LIKE

03:05.457 --> 03:05.990
HOTCAKES.

03:06.057 --> 03:06.624
IT'S REALLY A TRIBUTE TO

03:06.691 --> 03:11.830
A WELL‐RUN SHIP."

03:11.896 --> 03:13.164
AND I KNOW THIS WILL SHOCK YOU,

03:13.231 --> 03:14.699
BUT THE SITUATION THE PRESIDENT

03:14.766 --> 03:17.302
JUST SAID WAS GOING GREAT AND

03:17.368 --> 03:18.570
MAKES THEM LOOK GOOD ISN'T AND

03:18.636 --> 03:20.004
IT DOESN'T BECAUSE THE GLITCHES

03:20.071 --> 03:21.539
HE JUST TRIED TO BRUSH OFF WERE

03:21.606 --> 03:23.174
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL.

03:23.241 --> 03:24.142
OF THE DAY THE PROGRAM WAS

03:24.209 --> 03:25.877
SUPPOSED TO LUNCH, MANY OF THE

03:25.944 --> 03:27.312
NATION'S BIGGEST BANKS SAID THEY

03:27.378 --> 03:29.614
WEREN'T YET READY TO TAKE LOAN

03:29.681 --> 03:30.615
APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THE

03:30.682 --> 03:31.749
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T RELEASE FINAL

03:31.816 --> 03:33.051
VERSIONS OF THE DOCUMENTS THEY

03:33.118 --> 03:35.153
NEEDED UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.187
THIS MEANS MANY BANKS HAVE BEEN

03:36.254 --> 03:37.188
PLAYING CATCH‐UP, AS THIS

03:37.255 --> 03:37.789
HEALTH FOOD STORE OWNER

03:37.856 --> 03:38.690
DISCOVERED.

03:38.756 --> 03:40.658
>> MONDAY MORNING, I GO INTO

03:40.725 --> 03:42.227
MY BRANCH TO TALK TO MY ‐‐ MY

03:42.293 --> 03:43.695
BANKER.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.029
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

03:45.096 --> 03:47.332
GOING ON.

03:47.398 --> 03:47.832
HE WASN'T EVEN INFORMED.

03:47.899 --> 03:48.867
SO HE COULDN'T EVEN INFORM US TO

03:48.933 --> 03:51.102
APPLY, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW.

03:51.169 --> 03:53.204
>> IS IT FRUSTRATING FOR YOU

03:53.271 --> 03:56.007
WHEN YOU'RE HEARING, "NO, NO,

03:56.074 --> 03:58.176
NO, THE SBA'S GONNA GET

03:58.243 --> 04:00.278
INVOLVED, AND THEY ARE GOING TO

04:00.345 --> 04:01.446
PROVIDE A SAFETY NET?"

04:01.513 --> 04:01.913
>> BUT WHEN?

04:01.980 --> 04:03.114
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

04:03.181 --> 04:03.648
THAT'S THE MILLION‐DOLLAR

04:03.715 --> 04:04.048
QUESTION.

04:04.115 --> 04:05.984
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.152
WHETHER YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS

04:07.218 --> 04:08.786
OWNER OR A TRAPEZE ARTIST, THE

04:08.853 --> 04:11.322
TWO QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS WANT

04:11.389 --> 04:12.223
ANSWERED ABOUT YOUR SAFETY NET

04:12.290 --> 04:13.291
ARE "WHEN WILL IT BE THERE" AND

04:13.358 --> 04:15.560
"HOW BIG ARE THE HOLES."

04:15.627 --> 04:17.328
AND THE OBVIOUS PROBLEM IS,

04:17.395 --> 04:19.497
IF HELP TAKES MONTHS TO COME,

04:19.564 --> 04:20.932
THAT'S NOT GOING TO SAVE

04:20.999 --> 04:21.666
A BUSINESS SET TO GO UNDER

04:21.733 --> 04:23.234
IN WEEKS.

04:23.301 --> 04:25.503
NOW, TO BE FAIR, NO PROGRAM OF

04:25.570 --> 04:27.472
THIS SIZE WAS EVER GOING TO HAVE

04:27.539 --> 04:29.140
A PERFECT ROLLOUT.

04:29.207 --> 04:31.376
BUT THIS IS YET ANOTHER AREA

04:31.442 --> 04:32.277
WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION

04:32.343 --> 04:35.313
COULD'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS

04:35.380 --> 04:36.381
MUCH, MUCH SOONER.

04:36.447 --> 04:37.515
AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T HELP

04:37.582 --> 04:38.516
THAT THE DIRECTOR OF THE

04:38.583 --> 04:41.152
NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL,

04:41.219 --> 04:43.321
LARRY KUDLOW, DOWNPLAYED

04:43.388 --> 04:43.788
COMPLAINTS LIKE THIS.

04:43.855 --> 04:45.223
>> MY WIFE JUDY, WHOM YOU

04:45.290 --> 04:47.992
KNOW ‐‐ AND SHE IS A

04:48.059 --> 04:50.161
SELF‐EMPLOYED ARTIST‐PAINTER,

04:50.228 --> 04:53.164
A VERY DISTINGUISHED ONE OF SOME

04:53.231 --> 04:54.532
RENOWN ‐‐ SHE COULD USE SOME

04:54.599 --> 04:57.101
HELP FOR HER OPERATION, AND SHE

04:57.168 --> 05:01.406
WENT TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY BANK

05:01.472 --> 05:03.575
UP IN OUR PLACE IN CONNECTICUT

05:03.641 --> 05:05.143
AND APPARENTLY IT'S JUST A

05:05.210 --> 05:06.177
ONE‐PAGE FORM, THAT'S ALL IT IS.

05:06.244 --> 05:08.746
SO COULDN'T BE EASIER.

05:08.813 --> 05:09.080
>> John: YEAH.

05:09.147 --> 05:09.881
HIS RESPONSE WAS BASICALLY,

05:09.948 --> 05:11.983
"MY WIFE DID IT, SO WHAT'S

05:12.050 --> 05:12.617
THE PROBLEM?"

05:12.684 --> 05:14.485
WELL, THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES

05:14.552 --> 05:15.620
THERE: ONE, JUDY KUDLOW IS

05:15.687 --> 05:17.422
THE WIFE OF A HIGH‐RANKING

05:17.488 --> 05:19.190
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL, WHICH

05:19.257 --> 05:19.958
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME IMPACT ON

05:20.024 --> 05:21.559
HER EXPERIENCE AT THE BANK.

05:21.626 --> 05:22.994
TWO, I'M NOT SURE THE PHRASE

05:23.061 --> 05:24.729
"IT COULDN'T BE EASIER" SHOULD

05:24.796 --> 05:26.431
APPLY TO ANYONE WHOSE SITUATION

05:26.497 --> 05:27.532
INCLUDES BEING MARRIED TO

05:27.599 --> 05:29.167
LARRY KUDLOW.

05:29.234 --> 05:31.569
AND THREE, IF YOUR EARS PERKED

05:31.636 --> 05:33.571
UP WHEN YOU HEARD HIM SAY HIS

05:33.638 --> 05:34.405
WIFE IS AN ARTIST OF SOME

05:34.472 --> 05:36.874
RENOWN, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

05:36.941 --> 05:39.577
WE DID LOOK INTO IT, SO YOU

05:39.644 --> 05:41.145
MIGHT WANT TO LACE UP SOME COMFY

05:41.212 --> 05:42.213
SHOES, BECAUSE WE ARE ABOUT TO

05:42.280 --> 05:43.548
GO FOR A BRIEF WALK TOGETHER

05:43.615 --> 05:45.416
THROUGH JUDITH KUDLOW'S STILL

05:45.483 --> 05:45.683
LIFE WORK.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.285
IT OFTEN SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON

05:47.352 --> 05:48.886
HER HUSBAND'S CLOTHES.

05:48.953 --> 05:51.256
THAT'S A REAL PAINTING TITLED

05:51.322 --> 05:52.924
"THREE SHIRTS," SHOWCASING WHAT

05:52.991 --> 05:56.127
I CAN ONLY ASSUME ARE THREE OF

05:56.194 --> 05:56.494
LARRY'S SHIRTS.

05:56.561 --> 05:57.295
AND THAT'S JUST PART OF A LARGER

05:57.362 --> 05:58.463
COLLECTION IN HER

05:58.529 --> 06:00.131
"CLOSET SERIES," FEATURING

06:00.198 --> 06:01.466
SUCH PIECES AS "SUMMER SHIRT,"

06:01.532 --> 06:03.167
"GRAY AND WHITE,"

06:03.234 --> 06:04.669
"AMERICAN SHIRTS," AND

06:04.736 --> 06:06.604
"AMERICAN SHIRTS, 2013."

06:06.671 --> 06:07.905
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

06:07.972 --> 06:09.641
HER ART IS MERELY SHIRT‐BASED.

06:09.707 --> 06:11.342
SHE ALSO PAINTS HER HUSBAND'S

06:11.409 --> 06:12.477
TIES.

06:12.543 --> 06:15.346
LIKE, LOTS, AND LOTS, AND LOTS

06:15.413 --> 06:15.647
OF HIS TIES.

06:15.713 --> 06:17.282
JUST WHEN YOU THINK SHE COULDN'T

06:17.348 --> 06:19.284
POSSIBLY PAINT ANOTHER OF

06:19.350 --> 06:20.918
LARRY KUDLOW'S TIES, SHE DOES IT

06:20.985 --> 06:21.919
AGAIN, AND THEN SOMEHOW DOES IT

06:21.986 --> 06:22.954
AGAIN.

06:23.021 --> 06:24.522
AND THEN AGAIN, AND AGAIN,

06:24.589 --> 06:27.325
AND AGAIN.

06:27.392 --> 06:30.028
AND CRUCIALLY, LARRY KUDLOW

06:30.094 --> 06:30.628
HIMSELF APPEARS TO BE NOWHERE

06:30.695 --> 06:31.462
IN HER WORK.

06:31.529 --> 06:33.197
AND I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE ANY

06:33.264 --> 06:33.798
SWEEPING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEIR

06:33.865 --> 06:35.566
MARRIAGE.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.068
I'M JUST SAYING, THESE AREN'T SO

06:37.135 --> 06:38.136
MUCH PORTRAITS OF LARRY KUDLOW

06:38.202 --> 06:39.704
AS THEY ARE PORTRAITS OF

06:39.771 --> 06:41.572
THE "ABSENCE" OF LARRY KUDLOW.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.174
THEY SHOWCASE THE BEAUTY OF

06:43.241 --> 06:45.276
WHERE LARRY KUDLOW ISN'T.

06:45.343 --> 06:46.144
AND SURE, THAT'S A BEAUTY WE CAN

06:46.210 --> 06:47.779
ALL APPRECIATE!

06:47.845 --> 06:49.514
I MEAN, IT'S NO "STAY UP LATE"

06:49.580 --> 06:50.948
BY BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK,

06:51.015 --> 06:52.917
BUT WHAT IS?

06:52.984 --> 06:54.185
AND ON THAT NOTE: I ACTUALLY

06:54.252 --> 06:55.720
HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSITION.

06:55.787 --> 06:58.523
IF YOU'RE THE OWNER OF A

06:58.589 --> 06:59.824
JUDITH KUDLOW TIE PAINTING,

06:59.891 --> 07:01.426
I WANT ONE.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.461
YOU MAY REMEMBER, I OFFERED TO

07:03.528 --> 07:07.565
PAY $1,000 FOR "STAY UP LATE,"

07:07.632 --> 07:08.833
WHICH IS WHY I'M OFFERING

07:08.900 --> 07:09.767
$10 FOR ONE OF THESE.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.336
ALTHOUGH, THAT'S NOT ALL, AS

07:11.402 --> 07:12.437
THIS OFFER ALSO COMES WITH

07:12.503 --> 07:13.504
A $20,000 DONATION TO

07:13.571 --> 07:15.440
THE FOOD BANK IN YOUR AREA.

07:15.506 --> 07:18.576
SO IF YOU, OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW,

07:18.643 --> 07:20.712
OWNS ONE OF THESE LARRY‐LESS

07:20.778 --> 07:21.212
MASTERPIECES, JUST EMAIL

07:21.279 --> 07:22.013
John@JohnOliverWantsYour

07:22.080 --> 07:24.082
RatErotica.com

07:24.148 --> 07:25.616
THERE WAS NO NEED TO MAKE UP

07:25.683 --> 07:26.951
A NEW EMAIL ADDRESS WHEN

07:27.018 --> 07:28.686
THE PERFECT ONE WAS ALREADY

07:28.753 --> 07:29.387
AVAILABLE.

07:29.454 --> 07:29.954
ANYWAY, WHAT WERE WE TALKING

07:30.021 --> 07:30.755
ABOUT?

07:30.822 --> 07:31.789
THAT'S RIGHT ‐‐

07:31.856 --> 07:34.158
MASS UNEMPLOYMENT.

07:34.225 --> 07:35.693
WITH THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION

07:35.760 --> 07:37.195
PROGRAM EXPERIENCING A BUMPY

07:37.261 --> 07:39.163
ROLLOUT, AND THOUSANDS OF

07:39.230 --> 07:41.232
BUSINESSES LAYING OFF STAFF,

07:41.299 --> 07:42.066
MILLIONS ARE NOW IN NEED OF

07:42.133 --> 07:44.802
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.

07:44.869 --> 07:45.903
THAT IS WHY CONGRESS HAS

07:45.970 --> 07:47.205
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED

07:47.271 --> 07:48.005
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR

07:48.072 --> 07:48.973
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS,

07:49.040 --> 07:49.974
WHICH IS GOOD.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.376
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SHEER

07:51.442 --> 07:52.844
MAGNITUDE OF DEMAND, COMBINED

07:52.910 --> 07:54.112
WITH THE FACT MANY STATES'

07:54.178 --> 07:55.880
UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN

07:55.947 --> 07:57.448
NEGLECTED AND UNDERFUNDED FOR

07:57.515 --> 07:58.516
DECADES, MEANS THAT, TOO

07:58.583 --> 08:01.586
OFTEN, PEOPLE ARE HAVING

08:01.652 --> 08:02.220
REAL DIFFICULTY GETTING THROUGH.

08:02.286 --> 08:05.456
>> ALL SPECIALISTS ARE BUSY WITH

08:05.523 --> 08:05.823
OTHER CUSTOMERS.

08:05.890 --> 08:08.259
YOU MUST CALL BACK THIS WEEK.

08:08.326 --> 08:10.628
>> I'VE DONE THAT 50 TIMES,

08:10.695 --> 08:12.764
EVERY DAY, FOR TWO WEEKS.

08:12.830 --> 08:13.965
>> ARE YOU A MONTH AWAY FROM

08:14.031 --> 08:15.333
BEING BROKE?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.768
TWO MONTHS AWAY?

08:16.834 --> 08:19.971
>> I'D SAY ABOUT A MONTH.

08:20.037 --> 08:21.639
YEAH.

08:21.706 --> 08:23.541
>> YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS.

08:23.608 --> 08:24.175
WOULD YOU TRY THE UNEMPLOYMENT

08:24.242 --> 08:24.776
OFFICE AGAIN?

08:24.842 --> 08:27.211
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

08:27.278 --> 08:31.516
LET ME PULL UP THE NUMBER.

08:31.582 --> 08:33.217
>> WE'RE SORRY.

08:33.284 --> 08:34.819
WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN EXTREMELY

08:34.886 --> 08:36.020
HIGH VOLUME OF CALLS

08:36.087 --> 08:37.422
AT THIS TIME.

08:37.488 --> 08:39.457
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

08:39.524 --> 08:41.993
WITH THOSE RESULTS, YOU MIGHT AS

08:42.059 --> 08:44.495
WELL CALL 719‐266‐2837.

08:44.562 --> 08:46.531
IT'S THE CALLIN' OATES HOTLINE,

08:46.597 --> 08:48.032
AN ACTUAL NUMBER YOU CAN DIAL TO

08:48.099 --> 08:49.467
HEAR ONE OF FOUR POSSIBLE

08:49.534 --> 08:50.301
HALL AND OATES SONGS IN AN

08:50.368 --> 08:52.336
EMERGENCY.

08:52.403 --> 08:53.771
SURE, THEY CAN'T HELP YOU WITH

08:53.838 --> 08:55.206
YOUR HEALTHCARE OR FINANCES,

08:55.273 --> 08:57.475
BUT HONESTLY, NEITHER CAN THE

08:57.542 --> 08:58.075
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RIGHT NOW,

08:58.142 --> 08:59.510
AND AT LEAST WITH CALLIN' OATES

08:59.577 --> 09:01.012
YOU GET TO HEAR "MANEATER."

09:01.078 --> 09:02.413
SO ONCE AGAIN, THAT'S

09:02.480 --> 09:05.983
719‐26‐OATES.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.820
SO CLAIMING UNEMPLOYMENT IS

09:08.886 --> 09:10.321
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW,

09:10.388 --> 09:12.089
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

09:12.156 --> 09:12.757
THE FACT THAT, FOR MANY PEOPLE

09:12.824 --> 09:13.591
WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS,

09:13.658 --> 09:14.325
THEY THEN ALSO LOSE THEIR

09:14.392 --> 09:15.493
HEALTH INSURANCE.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.360
AND THIS IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY,

09:16.427 --> 09:17.662
A VERY BAD TIME FOR THAT TO BE

09:17.728 --> 09:18.362
HAPPENING.

09:18.429 --> 09:19.831
SO IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER MANY

09:19.897 --> 09:22.200
WHO CAN WORK, FEEL THEY HAVE TO,

09:22.266 --> 09:23.868
EVEN IF THAT MEANS ENDURING

09:23.935 --> 09:25.603
A DANGEROUS WORK ENVIRONMENT.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.538
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

09:27.605 --> 09:28.739
GROUP WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT

09:28.806 --> 09:30.508
TONIGHT: ESSENTIAL WORKERS.

09:30.575 --> 09:33.244
IT'S A BROAD TERM THAT CAN

09:33.311 --> 09:34.412
INCLUDE ANY JOB FROM HEALTHCARE

09:34.479 --> 09:36.881

09:58.336 --> 09:59.904
I'M SPENDING MY TIME DURING

09:59.971 --> 10:02.106

FUCKING DANCER/CAROLE‐BASKIN‐

10:09.213 --> 10:14.118
TRUTHER WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE.

10:14.185 --> 10:15.486
OR I SHOULD SAY...

10:15.553 --> 10:16.587
CAROLE "BASK"IN.

10:16.654 --> 10:17.889
AND COMPANIES WHO EMPLOY

10:17.955 --> 10:19.090
ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE OPENLY

10:19.156 --> 10:20.291
WAXED POETIC ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY

10:20.358 --> 10:21.659
VALUE THEM ‐‐ FEW IN MORE

10:21.726 --> 10:24.061
GLOWING TERMS THAN AMAZON.

10:24.128 --> 10:25.396
>> TO ALL OF OUR AMAZON

10:25.463 --> 10:26.564
RETAIL HEROES, ON THE FLOOR,

10:26.631 --> 10:28.499
IN THE AIR, AND BEHIND THE

10:28.566 --> 10:32.203
WHEEL, WE WANT TO THANK YOU.

10:32.270 --> 10:34.305
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING

10:34.372 --> 10:36.140
WE CAN TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY,

10:36.207 --> 10:38.409
SAFE, AND PROTECTED.

10:38.476 --> 10:39.510
THE WORK YOU ARE DOING MEANS

10:39.577 --> 10:41.078
EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.

10:41.145 --> 10:43.047
THANK YOU.

10:43.114 --> 10:45.516
>> John: IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT

10:45.583 --> 10:46.017
I LIKE LEAST ABOUT THAT.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.118
MAYBE IT'S THE SCHMALTZY

10:47.184 --> 10:49.420
PIANO MUSIC.

10:49.487 --> 10:50.121
MAYBE IT'S AMAZON PATRONIZINGLY

10:50.187 --> 10:51.656
CLAIMING THEY CARE ABOUT THE

10:51.722 --> 10:53.057
WELL‐BEING OF THEIR HEROES.

10:53.124 --> 10:54.425
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THE FACT

10:54.492 --> 10:55.526
THAT, OUT OF CONTEXT, THE AMAZON

10:55.593 --> 10:56.594
SMILE LOGO IS A QUICK SKETCH OF

10:56.661 --> 10:59.263
A CIRCUMCISED DICK.

10:59.330 --> 10:59.864
IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF

10:59.931 --> 11:00.398
ALL THREE.

11:00.464 --> 11:03.401
AND WHILE THE COMPANY CLAIMS

11:03.467 --> 11:03.968
IT'S KEEPING WORKERS SAFE BY

11:04.035 --> 11:07.171
DISTRIBUTING MASKS AND

11:07.238 --> 11:07.772
CONDUCTING TEMPERATURE CHECKS,

11:07.838 --> 11:09.640
MANY AMAZON WORKERS PAINT

11:09.707 --> 11:11.342
A MUCH DIFFERENT PICTURE, CITING

11:11.409 --> 11:12.243
CONCERNS LIKE "AN INABILITY TO

11:12.310 --> 11:13.744
MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING

11:13.811 --> 11:15.012
GUIDELINES, A LACK OF PROTECTIVE

11:15.079 --> 11:16.347
GEAR AND HAND SANITIZER, AND

11:16.414 --> 11:17.515
LACK OF TIME TO CLEAN THEIR

11:17.582 --> 11:19.283
HANDS."

11:19.350 --> 11:21.552
AND IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOT

11:21.619 --> 11:22.119
WORKING IN SAFE CONDITIONS,

11:22.186 --> 11:22.753
IT CAN BE EVEN MORE INFURIATING

11:22.820 --> 11:24.288
TO KNOW THE ITEMS YOU'RE PACKING

11:24.355 --> 11:25.990
CAN SOMETIMES BE ANYTHING BUT

11:26.057 --> 11:27.425
ESSENTIAL.

11:27.491 --> 11:28.593
>> THEY SHOULD NOT BE SELLING

11:28.659 --> 11:30.227
NON‐ESSENTIAL ITEMS.

11:30.294 --> 11:31.662
IF YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE,

11:31.729 --> 11:33.431
ALL THE ESSENTIAL ITEMS ARE SOLD

11:33.497 --> 11:35.333
OUT.

11:35.399 --> 11:36.000
UNTIL YOU RESTOCK,

11:36.067 --> 11:36.867
AND UNTIL YOU CLOSE THIS

11:36.934 --> 11:38.669
BUILDING, SHUT IT DOWN.

11:38.736 --> 11:42.873
DILDOS ARE NOT ESSENTIAL ITEMS.

11:42.940 --> 11:43.674
BOOKS FOR KIDS, YES.

11:43.741 --> 11:46.143
BUT DILDOS?

11:46.210 --> 11:47.979
NO.

11:48.045 --> 11:48.813
>> John: RIGHT.

11:48.879 --> 11:50.781
RISKING YOUR LIFE TO GET SOMEONE

11:50.848 --> 11:52.216
A SEX TOY PROBABLY DOESN'T FEEL

11:52.283 --> 11:53.884
FAIR.

11:53.951 --> 11:55.586
THERE'S A REASON "1917" WASN'T

11:55.653 --> 11:57.388
ABOUT TWO SOLDIERS TRYING TO

11:57.455 --> 11:58.022
BRING BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH

11:58.089 --> 12:01.258
A DILDO HE WANTED.

12:01.325 --> 12:01.659
ALTHOUGH, YES, THE

12:01.726 --> 12:02.860
CINEMATOGRAPHY WOULD STILL HAVE

12:02.927 --> 12:03.327
BEEN IMPRESSIVE.

12:03.394 --> 12:04.662
THE CONTINUOUS SHOT OF

12:04.729 --> 12:05.896
GEORGE MacKAY SPRINTING THROUGH

12:05.963 --> 12:07.398
THE TRENCHES FOLLOWED BY

12:07.465 --> 12:08.399
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH

12:08.466 --> 12:09.700
MASTURBATING WITH A DILDO

12:09.767 --> 12:10.501
TO COMPLETION?

12:10.568 --> 12:11.569
IN DEAKINS'S HANDS, IT WOULD

12:11.636 --> 12:14.672
HAVE BEEN A MASTERPIECE.

12:14.739 --> 12:17.241
AND LOOK: DETERMINING WHAT

12:17.308 --> 12:19.443
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PRODUCT

12:19.510 --> 12:20.911
CLEARLY ISN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD.

12:20.978 --> 12:22.480
IF DILDOS MAKE IT EASIER

12:22.546 --> 12:25.116
FOR PEOPLE TO STAY INSIDE,

12:25.182 --> 12:25.650
YOU COULD ARGUE THEY MIGHT

12:25.716 --> 12:27.151
LITERALLY SAVE LIVES.

12:27.218 --> 12:28.552
BUT IF WE'RE DEPENDING ON THOSE

12:28.619 --> 12:30.354
WORKERS FOR BOTH OUR SURVIVAL

12:30.421 --> 12:32.823
AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, OUR

12:32.890 --> 12:35.326
COMFORT, WE OWE THEM A LOT IN

12:35.393 --> 12:35.760
RETURN.

12:35.826 --> 12:36.627
AND COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING

12:36.694 --> 12:38.095
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO LOWER

12:38.162 --> 12:41.032
THE RISKS TO WORKERS ‐‐ WHICH

12:41.098 --> 12:43.534
CAN MEAN OFFERING PROTECTIVE

12:43.601 --> 12:44.769
GEAR, CHANGING WORKFLOW

12:44.835 --> 12:45.836
TO ALLOW FOR MORE DISTANCE,

12:45.903 --> 12:46.737
OR PUTTING UP PLEXIGLAS SHIELDS

12:46.804 --> 12:47.605
IN GROCERY STORES.

12:47.672 --> 12:48.739
AND ONE THING EVERY COMPANY

12:48.806 --> 12:49.907
SHOULD BE DOING IS OFFERING

12:49.974 --> 12:52.943
PAID SICK LEAVE.

12:53.010 --> 12:53.477
CONGRESS ACTUALLY REQUIRED

12:53.544 --> 12:55.446
EMPLOYERS TO TEMPORARILY PROVIDE

12:55.513 --> 12:57.815
TWO WEEKS OF THAT IN THE

12:57.882 --> 12:58.749
FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS

12:58.816 --> 13:00.151
RESPONSE ACT, BUT,

13:00.217 --> 13:02.086
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT REQUIREMENT

13:02.153 --> 13:03.854
ONLY APPLIES TO BUSINESSES WITH

13:03.921 --> 13:06.057
FEWER THAN 500 EMPLOYEES.

13:06.123 --> 13:07.558
THE THINKING WAS THAT LARGER

13:07.625 --> 13:08.926
COMPANIES WERE EITHER ALREADY

13:08.993 --> 13:10.061
OFFERING PAID SICK LEAVE, OR

13:10.127 --> 13:11.462
WOULD DO IT ON THEIR OWN.

13:11.529 --> 13:12.763
SADLY, THAT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN

13:12.830 --> 13:14.532
THE CASE.

13:14.598 --> 13:17.468
BUZZFEED FOUND THAT ALL THESE

13:17.535 --> 13:18.002
COMPANIES CURRENTLY HAVE

13:18.069 --> 13:19.370
POLICIES LESS GENEROUS THAN

13:19.437 --> 13:20.938
THE ONE THE GOVERNMENT

13:21.005 --> 13:22.273
ESTABLISHED FOR SMALL

13:22.339 --> 13:24.041
BUSINESSES, OR HAVE SET

13:24.108 --> 13:24.608
UNREASONABLY HIGH BARS TO

13:24.675 --> 13:27.044
QUALIFY.

13:27.111 --> 13:27.645
FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON'S INITIAL

13:27.712 --> 13:28.279
POLICY WAS THAT IT WOULD GIVE

13:28.345 --> 13:29.814
TWO WEEKS PAID TIME OFF FOR

13:29.880 --> 13:31.182
ANYONE WHO'S DIAGNOSED WITH

13:31.248 --> 13:32.450
COVID, OR WHO'S BEEN

13:32.516 --> 13:33.350
QUARANTINED.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.119
WHICH SOUNDS GOOD, BUT THERE'S

13:35.186 --> 13:36.987
A BIG PROBLEM WITH REQUIRING

13:37.054 --> 13:38.189
A POSITIVE TEST, AS ONE WORKER

13:38.255 --> 13:39.590
POINTED OUT.

13:39.657 --> 13:41.726
>> GOOD LUCK GETTING THE TEST IN

13:41.792 --> 13:43.260
THE STATE OF NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

13:43.327 --> 13:45.329
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE

13:45.396 --> 13:45.663
APPOINTMENTS.

13:45.730 --> 13:46.263
IT'S VERY HARD ‐‐ BY THE TIME

13:46.330 --> 13:47.898
YOU GET THE TEST, IT'S DAYS

13:47.965 --> 13:49.700
LATER.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.602
THE TIME YOU GET THE RESULTS IS

13:51.669 --> 13:51.902
DAYS LATER.

13:51.969 --> 13:53.337
>> John: EXACTLY!

13:53.404 --> 13:55.606
TESTING IN NEW YORK IS SO

13:55.673 --> 13:57.608
SCARCE, AMAZON'S PLAN MAY AS

13:57.675 --> 13:58.809
WELL HAVE BEEN: YOU GET DOUBLE

13:58.876 --> 14:00.077
PAY AND FREE HEALTHCARE FOR YOUR

14:00.144 --> 14:01.112
WHOLE FAMILY IF YOU CAN GUESS

14:01.178 --> 14:02.580
WHAT NUMBER JEFF BEZOS IS

14:02.646 --> 14:04.081
THINKING.

14:04.148 --> 14:06.617
THAT MAN'S NAME IS CHRIS SMALLS,

14:06.684 --> 14:08.552
AND HE WAS FIRED JUST TWO HOURS

14:08.619 --> 14:10.621
AFTER HE HELPED ORGANIZE AN

14:10.688 --> 14:11.655
EMPLOYEE WALKOUT IN AMAZON'S

14:11.722 --> 14:12.256
STATEN ISLAND FACILITY LAST

14:12.323 --> 14:13.524
WEEK.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.292
ACCORDING TO AMAZON, HE WAS LET

14:15.359 --> 14:16.694
GO FOR "PUTTING THE HEALTH AND

14:16.761 --> 14:18.796
SAFETY OF OTHERS AT RISK" BY

14:18.863 --> 14:20.231
"VIOLATING SOCIAL DISTANCING

14:20.297 --> 14:21.532
GUIDELINES AND AN ORDER TO

14:21.599 --> 14:23.567
QUARANTINE."

14:23.634 --> 14:26.871
BUT LEAKED NOTES FROM AN

14:26.937 --> 14:28.773
INTERNAL MEETING DAYS LATER ‐‐

14:28.839 --> 14:30.741
AT WHICH BEZOS HIMSELF WAS

14:30.808 --> 14:31.742
PRESENT ‐‐ SHOW THE COMPANY'S

14:31.809 --> 14:33.177
LEADERSHIP DISCUSSING PLANS TO

14:33.244 --> 14:34.912
MAKE SMALLS "THE FACE OF THE

14:34.979 --> 14:35.412
ENTIRE UNION/ORGANIZING

14:35.479 --> 14:35.880
MOVEMENT" SINCE HE IS

14:35.946 --> 14:37.581
"NOT SMART OR ARTICULATE."

14:37.648 --> 14:40.518
WHICH, HOLY SHIT!

14:40.584 --> 14:41.952
THAT IS SO RACIST, I CAN'T EVEN

14:42.019 --> 14:42.953
POINT OUT HOW SMART AND

14:43.020 --> 14:44.488
ARTICULATE SMALLS IS WITHOUT

14:44.555 --> 14:46.524
ALSO SOUNDING RACIST.

14:46.590 --> 14:47.992
AND AMAZON WILL SAY THAT THEY'VE

14:48.058 --> 14:50.027
NOW MADE THEIR SICK LEAVE POLICY

14:50.094 --> 14:51.529
MORE LENIENT FOR THEIR HEROES,

14:51.595 --> 14:52.730
WHICH IS TRUE.

14:52.797 --> 14:54.799
WHAT'S ALSO TRUE IS THAT ONLY

14:54.865 --> 14:57.501
CAME AFTER THEY GOT A LETTER

14:57.568 --> 14:58.536
FROM 14 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL,

14:58.602 --> 14:59.804
SAYING THEIR INITIAL POLICY WAS

14:59.870 --> 15:01.438
"INADEQUATE TO PROTECT THE

15:01.505 --> 15:01.872
PUBLIC HEALTH."

15:01.939 --> 15:04.408
AND THIS CLEARLY ISN'T JUST

15:04.475 --> 15:06.510
ABOUT AMAZON; AGAIN, MANY

15:06.577 --> 15:07.912
COMPANIES HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO

15:07.978 --> 15:09.713
OFFER PAID SICK LEAVE, POSSIBLY

15:09.780 --> 15:11.782
BECAUSE THE U. S. IS ONE OF

15:11.849 --> 15:14.051
THE FEW WEALTHY DEMOCRACIES THAT

15:14.118 --> 15:15.419
DOES NOT MANDATE THAT THEY DO

15:15.486 --> 15:16.187
THAT.

15:16.253 --> 15:17.988
AND THAT DOES A DISSERVICE NOT

15:18.055 --> 15:18.923
JUST TO WORKERS, BUT ALSO TO

15:18.989 --> 15:21.625
CUSTOMERS, AS THIS McDONALD'S

15:21.692 --> 15:22.259
EMPLOYEE WILL TELL YOU.

15:22.326 --> 15:23.394
>> I'VE WORKED AT McDONALD'S

15:23.460 --> 15:25.362
FOR OVER 10 YEARS.

15:25.429 --> 15:27.064
I'M THAT FACE THAT YOU SEE THAT

15:27.131 --> 15:30.067
SERVES YOU YOUR HASH BROWNS FOR

15:30.134 --> 15:30.467
BREAKFAST, MAYBE A

15:30.534 --> 15:31.068
QUARTER‐POUNDER FOR LUNCH, AND

15:31.135 --> 15:32.203
EVEN GAVE YOU A McFLURRY

15:32.269 --> 15:35.005
TO TOP OFF YOUR DINNER MENU.

15:35.072 --> 15:36.273
SO, I ASK YOU, IF I CAUGHT THE

15:36.340 --> 15:37.408
CORONAVIRUS, WOULD YOU WANT ME

15:37.474 --> 15:38.976
MAKING YOUR NEXT MEAL?

15:39.043 --> 15:41.679
>> John: NO, OF COURSE NOT!

15:41.745 --> 15:42.813
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE WITH THE

15:42.880 --> 15:44.315
CORONAVIRUS SERVING ME MY NEXT

15:44.381 --> 15:46.951
MEAL, UNLESS OF COURSE THAT

15:47.017 --> 15:48.752
PERSON WAS ADAM DRIVER, BECAUSE

15:48.819 --> 15:50.588
"INFECTING ME WITH DESSERT" IS

15:50.654 --> 15:51.622
VERY MUCH ON MY RUNNING LIST OF

15:51.689 --> 15:55.326
"THINGS ADAM DRIVER CAN DO

15:55.392 --> 15:56.694
TO ME."

15:56.760 --> 15:58.596
OH, I'M SORRY, YOU THOUGHT I'D

15:58.662 --> 16:00.231
STOP THE ADAM DRIVER BIT BECAUSE

16:00.297 --> 16:01.432
I'M STUCK AT HOME NOW?

16:01.498 --> 16:02.099
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.234
AND YES, I KNOW MY WIFE CAN HEAR

16:03.300 --> 16:03.734
ME, THAT'S PART OF IT.

16:03.801 --> 16:05.603
SNEEZE IN MY McFLURRY,

16:05.669 --> 16:06.470
YOU PENSIVE BISON.

16:06.537 --> 16:09.406
RAVAGE MY LUNGS,

16:09.473 --> 16:12.176
YOU RELENTLESS HILLOCK.

16:12.243 --> 16:13.043
LOOK, CONGRESS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS

16:13.110 --> 16:14.778
TO MANDATE ALL BUSINESSES

16:14.845 --> 16:17.414
PROVIDE PAID SICK LEAVE IN THEIR

16:17.481 --> 16:18.048
NEXT CORONAVIRUS AID BILL, ON A

16:18.115 --> 16:21.485
PERMANENT BASIS, AS WELL AS

16:21.552 --> 16:22.152
REQUIRE THEY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT

16:22.219 --> 16:23.420
HAZARD PAY FOR ANY WORKER BEING

16:23.487 --> 16:24.788
ASKED TO RISK THEIR LIVES.

16:24.855 --> 16:27.324
BECAUSE THAT RISK IS VERY, VERY

16:27.391 --> 16:28.125
REAL.

16:28.192 --> 16:30.327
GROCERY STORE WORKERS ARE DYING

16:30.394 --> 16:32.863
OF THIS DISEASE RIGHT NOW, AND

16:32.930 --> 16:33.998
SO FAR, WE'VE LOST 41 TRANSIT

16:34.064 --> 16:36.267
WORKERS IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.403
AND THIS IS THE LEAST OF WHAT

16:39.470 --> 16:40.905
ESSENTIAL WORKERS ‐‐ AND,

16:40.971 --> 16:41.372
INDEED, ALL WORKERS ‐‐

16:41.438 --> 16:41.939
NEED RIGHT NOW.

16:42.006 --> 16:43.274
THEY NEED PROTECTION:

16:43.340 --> 16:44.375
FINANCIALLY, PHYSICALLY, AND

16:44.441 --> 16:45.976
OTHERWISE.

16:46.043 --> 16:47.711
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME TRULY

16:47.778 --> 16:49.046
INDEFENSIBLE SITUATIONS BEING

16:49.113 --> 16:51.081
THROWN INTO PLAIN VIEW.

16:51.148 --> 16:52.616
TAKE THIS E. M. T. IN

16:52.683 --> 16:53.951
NEW YORK STATE, WHO'S DOING

16:54.018 --> 16:55.953
INCREDIBLE, DANGEROUS WORK,

16:56.020 --> 16:57.254
WITHOUT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT

16:57.321 --> 16:58.689
ASSUME HE HAS.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.624
>> RIGHT NOW, I'M DOING ALL OF

17:00.691 --> 17:03.594
THIS WITH NO HEALTH INSURANCE.

17:03.661 --> 17:04.328
>> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

17:04.395 --> 17:05.296
>> I ‐‐

17:05.362 --> 17:06.196
>> IT DOESN'T COME

17:06.263 --> 17:07.431
THROUGH THE JOB?

17:07.498 --> 17:09.133
>> THE JOB DOESN'T OFFER IT.

17:09.199 --> 17:11.402
AND OUR AFFORDABLE MARKETPLACES

17:11.468 --> 17:15.839
AREN'T VERY AFFORDABLE.

17:15.906 --> 17:17.508
IF I GET SICK AND, OKAY, I GO

17:17.574 --> 17:19.743
GET TESTED POSITIVE, I CAN'T GO

17:19.810 --> 17:21.812
TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:21.879 --> 17:23.547
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COME OUT,

17:23.614 --> 17:24.181
AND THEY SHOW US THEIR SUPPORT.

17:24.248 --> 17:25.516
AND I LOVE IT.

17:25.582 --> 17:26.283
I LOVE ‐‐ I HAVE EATEN SO MUCH

17:26.350 --> 17:27.584
PIZZA IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

17:27.651 --> 17:29.853
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.921
I DON'T NEED PIZZA.

17:30.988 --> 17:32.990
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO

17:33.057 --> 17:33.324
PAY MY BILLS.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.326
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK A

17:35.392 --> 17:36.694
40‐HOUR WORKWEEK, AND LIVE LIKE

17:36.760 --> 17:40.297
A NORMAL HUMAN BEING.

17:40.364 --> 17:42.333
>> John: YEAH, IT'S LIKE THAT

17:42.399 --> 17:44.134
OLD SAYING ABOUT PIZZA AND SEX:

17:44.201 --> 17:45.669
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE BAD, THEY'RE

17:45.736 --> 17:46.537
STILL PRETTY GOOD, AND EVEN WHEN

17:46.603 --> 17:47.738
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD, YOU STILL

17:47.805 --> 17:50.507
NEED FUCKING HEALTH CARE.

17:50.574 --> 17:51.809
AND OBVIOUSLY, HIS WORK SHOULD

17:51.875 --> 17:53.077
GIVE HIM HEALTH INSURANCE.

17:53.143 --> 17:56.880
BUT MORE BROADLY, WE NEED TO

17:56.947 --> 17:57.481
SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER

17:57.548 --> 17:58.182
HAVING OUR HEALTH INSURANCE

17:58.248 --> 17:59.483
SYSTEM SO TIED TO EMPLOYMENT IS

17:59.550 --> 18:00.217
A GOOD IDEA.

18:00.284 --> 18:01.518
BECAUSE I WOULD ARGUE

18:01.585 --> 18:03.320
IT EMPHATICALLY ISN'T.

18:03.387 --> 18:04.421
IN FACT, WHILE MANY OF THE

18:04.488 --> 18:05.889
PROBLEMS WE'RE BEING FORCED TO

18:05.956 --> 18:09.059
CONFRONT RIGHT NOW WEREN'T

18:09.126 --> 18:09.626
CREATED BY THE CORONAVIRUS,

18:09.693 --> 18:10.427
IT HAS THROWN A SPOTLIGHT ON

18:10.494 --> 18:12.129
SOME OF THE BIGGEST FLAWS IN

18:12.196 --> 18:14.298
HOW OUR SYSTEM OPERATES.

18:14.365 --> 18:16.166
THINGS LIKE PAID SICK LEAVE AND

18:16.233 --> 18:17.901
HAZARD PAY ARE ESSENTIALLY

18:17.968 --> 18:19.136
BAND‐AIDS, AND WE ABSOLUTELY

18:19.203 --> 18:20.304
NEED THEM RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE

18:20.371 --> 18:23.307
WE'RE BLEEDING.

18:23.374 --> 18:24.108
BUT WHEN THIS IS OVER, THIS

18:24.174 --> 18:24.675
COUNTRY'S GOING TO NEED MORE

18:24.742 --> 18:25.376
THAN BAND‐AIDS.

18:25.442 --> 18:27.344
IT'S GOING TO NEED FUCKING

18:27.411 --> 18:27.845
SURGERY.

18:27.911 --> 18:30.014
THINGS NEED TO CHANGE, NOT GO

18:30.080 --> 18:31.882
"BACK TO NORMAL."

18:31.949 --> 18:34.018
CONTROL‐Z‐ING US BACK TO HOW WE

18:34.084 --> 18:36.153
WERE IN 2016 IS SIMPLY NOT GOING

18:36.220 --> 18:36.854
TO CUT IT.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.689
AND HONESTLY, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

18:38.756 --> 18:40.290
TAKEN A PANDEMIC TO PROVE OUR

18:40.357 --> 18:42.126
UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM IS A MESS,

18:42.192 --> 18:43.594
THAT WE NEED UNIVERSAL

18:43.660 --> 18:45.462
HEALTH CARE, AND THAT WORKERS

18:45.529 --> 18:46.330
NEED BENEFITS, THE RIGHT TO

18:46.397 --> 18:48.232
ORGANIZE, AND WAGES THAT REFLECT

18:48.298 --> 18:49.700
HOW ESSENTIAL THEY REALLY ARE.

18:49.767 --> 18:51.168
AND WE ALSO SHOULDN'T HAVE

18:51.235 --> 18:52.603
NEEDED A PANDEMIC TO CONSIDER

18:52.669 --> 18:54.304
WHETHER MASS INCARCERATION IS

18:54.371 --> 18:55.506
TOLERABLE, AS PRISONS AND JAILS

18:55.572 --> 18:58.008
BECOME PETRI DISHES FOR

18:58.075 --> 18:59.710
THE CORONAVIRUS.

18:59.777 --> 19:00.944
OR WHETHER OUR TREATMENT OF THE

19:01.011 --> 19:01.779
HOMELESS IS ADEQUATE, WHEN WE'VE

19:01.845 --> 19:03.414
SEEN PHOTOS OF THEM SLEEPING IN

19:03.480 --> 19:04.681
A PARKING LOT SIX FEET APART.

19:04.748 --> 19:06.250
OR WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE MULTIPLE

19:06.316 --> 19:08.519
UNDERLYING INEQUALITIES THAT ARE

19:08.585 --> 19:09.486
MAKING THIS VIRUS, IN SOME

19:09.553 --> 19:10.921
PLACES, TWICE AS DEADLY FOR

19:10.988 --> 19:14.091
BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE AS

19:14.158 --> 19:14.324
WHITES.

19:14.391 --> 19:16.794
AND WHAT'S BEEN INFURIATING

19:16.860 --> 19:19.329
IS THAT SOME CONSERVATIVES HAVE

19:19.396 --> 19:19.963
SEEMED WORRIED THAT WE MIGHT DO

19:20.030 --> 19:21.932
TOO MUCH.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.567
>> THE EXTENSION OF PAID SICK

19:23.634 --> 19:25.602
LEAVE OPENS THE DOOR.

19:25.669 --> 19:26.837
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

19:26.904 --> 19:27.471
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE?

19:27.538 --> 19:28.439
SCHUMER'S GOING TO WANT

19:28.505 --> 19:29.440
A PERMANENT PROGRAM.

19:29.506 --> 19:30.374
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET

19:30.441 --> 19:30.974
ANOTHER SOCIAL PROGRAM OUT OF

19:31.041 --> 19:31.542
THIS.

19:31.608 --> 19:32.776
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:32.843 --> 19:33.143
>> John: REALLY?

19:33.210 --> 19:34.845
WHY THE FUCK NOT?

19:34.912 --> 19:36.580
THAT ARGUMENT BASICALLY BOILS

19:36.647 --> 19:38.482
DOWN TO, "WELL, IF WE HELP

19:38.549 --> 19:40.350
PEOPLE TODAY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE

19:40.417 --> 19:45.722
JUST GOING TO WANT TO HELP MORE

19:45.789 --> 19:47.357
PEOPLE TOMORROW," LIKE THAT'S

19:47.424 --> 19:48.292
A BAD THING.

19:48.358 --> 19:48.926
AND WHILE DOLLAR‐STORE BILL NYE

19:48.992 --> 19:49.526
HAS MODERATED HIS STANCE SINCE

19:49.593 --> 19:50.160
THEN, OTHERS ARE STILL ADAMANT

19:50.227 --> 19:51.328
THAT NOTHING SHOULD PERMANENTLY

19:51.395 --> 19:53.897
CHANGE BECAUSE OF THIS.

19:53.964 --> 19:55.332
FLORIDA SENATOR RICK SCOTT ‐‐

19:55.399 --> 19:57.101
SEEN HERE HAVING JUST LEARNED

19:57.167 --> 19:58.168
THAT ENOUGH MONEY WAS RAISED

19:58.235 --> 19:59.636
AT THE TALENT SHOW AND HE WON'T

19:59.703 --> 20:01.338
BE ABLE TO SHUT DOWN THE

20:01.405 --> 20:03.340
ORPHANAGE AFTER ALL ‐‐ PUT OUT

20:03.407 --> 20:04.641
A STATEMENT ARGUING THAT

20:04.708 --> 20:05.609
THIS CRISIS SHOULDN'T BE AN

20:05.676 --> 20:07.177
OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF

20:07.244 --> 20:08.178
CONGRESS TO PERMANENTLY EXPAND

20:08.245 --> 20:10.013
THE WELFARE STATE.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.548
WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE THERE

20:11.615 --> 20:12.816
IS NO BETTER ARGUMENT FOR

20:12.883 --> 20:15.352
A PERMANENT WELFARE STATE THAN

20:15.419 --> 20:17.421
WATCHING YOUR GOVERNMENT

20:17.488 --> 20:19.957
DESPERATELY TRY TO BUILD ONE

26:23.086 --> 26:24.888
ALL OF WHICH IS VERY GOOD.

26:24.955 --> 26:27.057
BUT NOT WHAT I NEEDED.

26:27.123 --> 26:29.059
WE DID, HOWEVER, GET ONE

26:29.125 --> 26:31.361
INTRIGUING MESSAGE WHICH READ

26:39.836 --> 26:41.171

26:44.407 --> 26:46.176
AND LOOK: IS THIS WHAT AMERICA

26:46.243 --> 26:47.878

26:47.944 --> 26:50.146
NO, OF COURSE IT ISN'T.

26:50.213 --> 26:51.515
AMERICA NEEDS A VACCINE,

26:53.450 --> 26:54.718
A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT, AND ALSO,

26:54.784 --> 26:55.952
JUST, LIKE, A QUICK BREAK.

26:56.019 --> 26:57.521
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE

26:57.587 --> 26:58.421
IN THE MEANTIME?

26:58.488 --> 27:00.357
A VICTORY.

27:00.423 --> 27:02.526
AND MANAGING TO TRACK DOWN THAT

27:02.592 --> 27:03.860
PAINTING WOULD DEFINITELY

27:03.927 --> 27:06.162
BE A WIN.

27:06.229 --> 27:08.031
BECAUSE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

27:08.098 --> 27:11.835
THAT, IN 1992, IN SOUTH CENTRAL

27:11.902 --> 27:13.603
PENNSYLVANIA, A MAN WOULD HAVE

27:13.670 --> 27:14.471

27:14.538 --> 27:16.740
HIGH‐QUALITY RAT EROTICA?

27:16.806 --> 27:18.742
AND THEN, INSTEAD OF THROWING IT

27:18.808 --> 27:21.011
AWAY AT LITERALLY ANY POINT IN

27:21.077 --> 27:22.379
THE PAST 28 YEARS, KEPT IT,

27:22.445 --> 27:25.048
CHERISHED IT, FRAMED IT,

27:25.115 --> 27:27.150
NOT KNOWING THAT ONE DAY, FAR IN

27:27.217 --> 27:29.419
THE FUTURE, IT MIGHT FORCE HBO

27:29.486 --> 27:31.888
TO DONATE $20,000 TO

27:31.955 --> 27:32.389
PENNSYLVANIA FOOD BANKS

27:32.455 --> 27:33.957
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC?

27:34.024 --> 27:35.692
