00:14.097 --> 00:15.850
Hey, guys,

00:14.097 --> 00:15.850
I got the light bulbs.

00:15.891 --> 00:16.934
All: Surprise!

00:16.976 --> 00:18.769
(Henry screams)

00:20.521 --> 00:21.605
What was that for?

00:21.647 --> 00:22.898
It's not my birthday.

00:23.064 --> 00:23.899
(Ray)

00:23.064 --> 00:23.899
We know.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.234
Give me your head.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.654
You, little buddy,

00:26.986 --> 00:28.654
are gonna be on television.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.322
I'll get the shirt.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.573
Shirt? Wait.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.617
What are you rubbing

00:32.324 --> 00:33.617
on my face?

00:34.451 --> 00:35.744
- Makeup.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.744
- Why?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.204
You're going to be

00:35.786 --> 00:37.204
on "Spin and Win."

00:37.454 --> 00:38.246
The game show?

00:38.288 --> 00:39.623
Yep.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.041
Hey, which shirt

00:39.665 --> 00:41.041
should Henry wear?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.084
Gooch one or

00:41.458 --> 00:43.084
Gooch two?

00:43.752 --> 00:44.503
Neither.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.631
Oh, come on.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.631
Gooch is the new black.

00:48.883 --> 00:49.884
Just pick

00:48.883 --> 00:49.884
a different shirt.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.054
All right, can someone tell me

00:51.092 --> 00:54.054
why we're doing this?

00:54.095 --> 00:54.972
We'll both tell you.

00:55.014 --> 00:55.764
Alternating?

00:55.806 --> 00:56.765
Sure. You start.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.350
You know those

00:57.307 --> 00:58.350
weird burglaries

00:58.392 --> 00:59.560
that have been happening

00:58.392 --> 00:59.560
all over town?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
And how the police

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
have no idea

01:01.144 --> 01:03.355
how the burglars are getting in

01:01.144 --> 01:03.355
or out of the people's houses?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.899
Well, Charlotte

01:03.397 --> 01:04.899
figured out that

01:04.940 --> 01:06.608
in every one of the houses

01:04.940 --> 01:06.608
that have been burglarized,

01:06.650 --> 01:09.653
someone had recently been

01:06.650 --> 01:09.653
on "Spin and Win" and won.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.113
But then,

01:10.111 --> 01:12.113
all the winners' prizes

01:12.155 --> 01:13.574
were stolen

01:12.155 --> 01:13.574
from their houses.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.619
You guys realize there's broken

01:14.992 --> 01:17.619
glass all over the floor.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.330
How about this one?

01:20.706 --> 01:21.874
I like it.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.083
Pop that ugly shirt off.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.960
Why do I have

01:23.709 --> 01:24.960
to change clothes?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
Because you're going

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
to be on TV, boy.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.965
Don't you want to

01:28.047 --> 01:29.965
look gooood?

01:30.674 --> 01:33.552
I thought I looked gooood

01:30.674 --> 01:33.552
before I came in here.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.970
Ehhh...

01:37.138 --> 01:40.141
Man, I can't believe I'm going

01:37.138 --> 01:40.141
to be on "Spin and Win."

01:40.601 --> 01:43.353
Hey, what if

01:40.601 --> 01:43.353
Henry doesn't win?

01:43.395 --> 01:44.354
He better win.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.522
- Why?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.106
So you'll get

01:45.564 --> 01:47.106
the prizes...

01:47.148 --> 01:49.526
And then we wait at your house

01:47.148 --> 01:49.526
to see if you get burglarized.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.569
Wait, hang on.

01:50.903 --> 01:51.570
What?

01:51.904 --> 01:52.821
You're smarter than me,

01:53.072 --> 01:54.907
why don't you go

01:53.072 --> 01:54.907
on the show and win?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.742
I don't want

01:55.115 --> 01:56.742
my house burgled.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.203
(phone ringing)

02:00.955 --> 02:02.081
What's up?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.458
Hey, Henry, would you

02:02.122 --> 02:04.458
please come home?

02:04.499 --> 02:05.417
Why?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.086
Because Jasper came over

02:05.918 --> 02:07.086
to hang out,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.463
but you're not here,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.463
Piper doesn't like him,

02:09.504 --> 02:10.923
your mom's at the rodeo

02:09.504 --> 02:10.923
until Sunday,

02:11.048 --> 02:12.883
and I got nothing

02:11.048 --> 02:12.883
to say to this kid.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.718
Uh...

02:15.761 --> 02:17.387
Would you like me

02:15.761 --> 02:17.387
to give you some privacy?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.681
Will you go stand

02:18.055 --> 02:19.681
on the porch?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.312
Well, I'm not going to be home

02:23.310 --> 02:25.312
until later tonight.

02:25.771 --> 02:26.480
(door locks)

02:27.773 --> 02:30.233
Oh. Working late

02:27.773 --> 02:30.233
at the store?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.234
No.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.193
I'm going to be

02:31.276 --> 02:32.193
on "Spin and Win."

02:32.235 --> 02:33.278
The game show?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.071
Yeah.

02:34.113 --> 02:34.947
Piper.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.573
Your brother's going to be

02:35.405 --> 02:36.573
on "Spin and Win."

02:36.949 --> 02:37.741
Can we go?

02:37.783 --> 02:38.575
Can we go?

02:38.617 --> 02:39.493
(knocking on window)

02:39.534 --> 02:40.535
I want to go.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.163
Can my dad go to the show

02:41.244 --> 02:43.163
with my sister?

02:43.204 --> 02:46.207
I guess. Just tell him to get

02:43.204 --> 02:46.207
there early so they can get

02:43.204 --> 02:46.207
tickets.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.627
Yeah,

02:46.917 --> 02:48.627
just get there early.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.294
Yes.

02:49.795 --> 02:50.796
We're going to

02:49.795 --> 02:50.796
"Spin and Win."

02:51.296 --> 02:53.674
Cool. I'm going to bring

02:51.296 --> 02:53.674
my selfie stick.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.925
(knocking on window)

02:55.300 --> 02:56.175
Can I go?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.053
Let's go out the back.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.769
Okay. I'll ride Piper's bike

03:02.641 --> 03:05.769
and meet you guys there.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.775
Whoa.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.775
These are some sweet wheels.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.987
It all just

03:13.819 --> 03:14.987
kind of happened.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.156
My dad was

03:15.029 --> 03:17.156
an irresponsible scientist.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.449
I wanted an

03:17.823 --> 03:19.449
after school job.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.285
(Captain Man)

03:19.491 --> 03:22.285
And by accident,

03:19.491 --> 03:22.285
he made me indestructible.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
Ahhh!

03:23.620 --> 03:25.455
(Henry)

03:23.620 --> 03:25.455
I went to

03:23.620 --> 03:25.455
this crazy store

03:25.706 --> 03:27.749
and met a pretty

03:25.706 --> 03:27.749
interesting guy.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.459
I'm going to

03:27.791 --> 03:29.459
blow your mind.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.628
(Captain Man)

03:29.501 --> 03:31.628
Now I protect the good

03:29.501 --> 03:31.628
citizens of Swellview.

03:31.962 --> 03:32.921
Who call me...

03:32.963 --> 03:34.339
(Henry)

03:32.963 --> 03:34.339
And he turned out to be...

03:34.381 --> 03:35.298
(Captain Man)

03:34.381 --> 03:35.298
You know the name.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.091
Captain man!

03:36.133 --> 03:37.092
That's right, Henry.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.845
In time, I realized

03:37.718 --> 03:39.845
that being a superhero

03:39.887 --> 03:41.262
is a lot to handle alone.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.514
He wanted some help.

03:42.848 --> 03:43.807
(Captain Man)

03:42.848 --> 03:43.807
I needed a sidekick.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.684
I, Henry Hart...

03:45.726 --> 03:47.394
(Captain Man)

03:45.726 --> 03:47.394
Pledge to never ever

03:45.726 --> 03:47.394
ever tell anyone...

03:47.435 --> 03:48.896
That I'm captain man's

03:47.435 --> 03:48.896
secret sidekick.

03:48.937 --> 03:49.688
(Captain Man)

03:48.937 --> 03:49.688
It is done.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.106
(Henry)

03:50.064 --> 03:51.106
Now we blow bubbles.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.315
(Captain Man)

03:51.398 --> 03:52.315
And fight crime.

03:52.357 --> 03:52.983

03:52.357 --> 03:52.983
Feels good.

my nose...

05:43.677 --> 05:44.511
Is it noticeable?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.931
It looks like

05:46.013 --> 05:47.931
a big purple meatball.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.059
I'm talking

05:48.974 --> 05:51.059
to the doctor.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.270
Well, it does look like

a big purple meatball.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.923
and put them in the white Van.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.592
<i>Uh.</i>

14:56.979 --> 14:58.147
Hey,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.147
where you taking that?

14:59.440 --> 15:00.233
Henry? Wh--

15:02.109 --> 15:03.027
He just walked

15:02.109 --> 15:03.027
right past us.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.112
And I think

15:03.361 --> 15:05.112
he was drooling again.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.575
Fix his nose.

15:08.908 --> 15:13.872
(speaks foreign language)

15:14.372 --> 15:18.000
Fix... his... nose.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.588
Just hold on.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.965
(speaks foreign language)

15:27.218 --> 15:29.387
(groans)

15:29.846 --> 15:30.889
Why did you just...

15:31.389 --> 15:32.599
Oh...

15:33.224 --> 15:34.684
I said "hit" his nose.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.061
What's the word for "fix"?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.647
Can I please just have

15:37.645 --> 15:39.647
a different medical student

15:39.689 --> 15:41.274
who does speak English?

15:41.315 --> 15:43.150
Hey...

15:41.315 --> 15:43.150
That's insensitive.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.612
(speaks foreign language)

15:51.910 --> 15:52.660
-Henry.

15:53.994 --> 15:54.995
Hey.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.039
Why are you putting your prizes

15:55.496 --> 15:57.039
in that Van outside?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.166
Say something.

16:09.761 --> 16:10.804
Why is Henry

16:09.761 --> 16:10.804
acting so weird?

16:11.095 --> 16:11.971
I don't know.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.015
But it started when someone

16:12.847 --> 16:15.015
video-chatted him.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.684
Maybe...

16:16.726 --> 16:18.060
Hypnosis.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.520
Hypnosis?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.857
Call the kid.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.857
Release him from hypnosis.

16:22.899 --> 16:23.817
Copy that.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.861
We're going

16:25.192 --> 16:26.861
to have hot yogurt.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.195
Hot yogurt.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.951
So that's why the cops

16:29.906 --> 16:32.951
could never catch the burglar.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.285
Because there is

16:32.992 --> 16:34.285
no burglar.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.747
Someone figured out a way to

16:34.619 --> 16:37.747
make people burgle themselves.

16:38.623 --> 16:39.707
What's up, guys?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.252
Hey.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.252
Where'd all my prizes go?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.796
You picked them up,

16:43.544 --> 16:44.796
took them outside,

16:44.838 --> 16:46.088
and put them in a Van.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.340
Huh?

16:47.715 --> 16:48.549
We'll explain later.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.302
Right now we're going to track

16:49.467 --> 16:51.302
that Van and find your prizes.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.513
And the criminals who made

16:51.344 --> 16:53.513
you burglarize yourself.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.014
Right. But first...

16:55.807 --> 16:57.767
Owww!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.105
Ow...

17:08.110 --> 17:11.071
No. No, we'll sell you

17:08.110 --> 17:11.071
four of the prizes.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.741
No, just four.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.870
Cause we're keeping

17:14.450 --> 17:16.870
the hot yogurt machine.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.204
Yeah we are.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.709
All right, they're on

17:20.373 --> 17:22.709
their way over with the money.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.168
-Nice.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.168
-Sweet.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.381
- Hey!

17:29.173 --> 17:31.258
Get your hands off

17:29.173 --> 17:31.258
that hot yogurt machine.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.012
Captain Man

17:32.635 --> 17:34.012
and Kid Danger.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.346
What do you guys want?

17:35.680 --> 17:40.059
We want you to stop hypnotizing

17:35.680 --> 17:40.059
innocent game show contestants

17:40.100 --> 17:41.352
and stealing their prizes.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.437
Yeah.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.437
That's what we want.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.273
You kids make me sad.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.317
Cause you're jerks.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.571
You don't know

17:49.610 --> 17:51.571
anything about us.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.615
You have no idea what it's like

17:51.612 --> 17:54.615
to spend all day working here.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.617
Watching other people

17:54.657 --> 17:56.617
get cool prizes.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.995
So you think it's okay

17:56.868 --> 17:58.995
to hypnotize

17:59.037 --> 18:00.454
innocent prize winners?

18:00.496 --> 18:03.249
And force them to give

18:00.496 --> 18:03.249
their prizes back?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.292
So you guys can

18:03.290 --> 18:05.292
sell them for money?

18:06.669 --> 18:08.004
- It's worked out

18:06.669 --> 18:08.004
great so far.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.004
- Well, yeah. I mean--

18:08.046 --> 18:10.715
-Made a lot of money.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.715
-We have no problem with it.

18:10.757 --> 18:15.720
Well, now it's time for you two

18:10.757 --> 18:15.720
to spin and--

18:10.757 --> 18:15.720
-And lose.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
I was going

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
to say that.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.597
Yeah, sure you were.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.349
You guys are going

18:19.057 --> 18:20.349
to get it now.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.978
Girls. Show our contestants

18:20.641 --> 18:23.978
what they've won.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.358
I think those girls

18:28.107 --> 18:29.358
want to fight us.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.277
I could think of

18:30.234 --> 18:31.277
worse things.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.154
We can't hit girls.

18:34.989 --> 18:35.823
Right.

18:35.865 --> 18:36.574
Quinoa!

18:36.616 --> 18:37.825
-Bok choi!

18:36.616 --> 18:37.825
-Foo goo!

18:38.826 --> 18:39.702
How do we fight them?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.120
Uh, we don't.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.622
Just try to avoid

18:41.579 --> 18:42.622
getting hurt.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.330
But how do we--

18:48.878 --> 18:49.503
Sorry.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.507
Ah! I'm okay.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.259
(Henry)

18:54.258 --> 18:55.259
I'm awesome.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.723
I'm okay!

18:59.263 --> 19:00.723
Now, hey, listen.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.564
Seriously?

19:14.528 --> 19:15.696
Okay, okay, now, look.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.541
Captain Man!

19:27.583 --> 19:28.250
What?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.170
These girls are dudes.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.593
They are dudes.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.972
Did you know

19:39.219 --> 19:40.972
they were dudes?

19:41.014 --> 19:42.181
I had no idea.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.224
Now what?

19:44.266 --> 19:46.352
Well, now we can hit them

19:44.266 --> 19:46.352
as hard and as often as we want.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.187
Then let's do that.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.037
Nah!

20:06.122 --> 20:07.456
And to think

20:06.122 --> 20:07.456
I was going to ask

20:07.498 --> 20:09.208
all three of you out

20:07.498 --> 20:09.208
at the same time.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.634
I guess you're going to

20:16.340 --> 20:18.634
call the cops on us now.

20:19.135 --> 20:19.802
Yeah, I am.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.555
It's nine, one--

20:22.596 --> 20:23.764
I know the number.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.268
(guitar riffing)

20:32.690 --> 20:35.026
-Hey.

20:36.194 --> 20:36.986
Wow.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.487
- What is all this?

20:38.529 --> 20:40.114
The prizes I won

20:38.529 --> 20:40.114
on the game show.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.991
Whoa. What's this thing?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.576
It's for fighting sharks.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.911
It's called a sharkpoon.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.037
Mm.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.707
Oh, dad,

20:50.374 --> 20:52.210
this is my boss

20:50.374 --> 20:52.210
from Junk-n-Stuff.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.169
Ohh.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.212
Ray Manchester.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.255
Oh yeah,

20:54.795 --> 20:56.255
great to finally meet you.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.465
Yeah, you too.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.465
You have a beautiful wife.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.425
House. House.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.385
Thanks.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.263
How does a

21:02.595 --> 21:04.263
sharkpoon work?

21:04.889 --> 21:06.099
Be careful with that.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.975
"Be careful with that."

21:09.894 --> 21:11.353
So how's your nose?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.564
Broken.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.564
But it's going to heal.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.858
And then will it look

21:14.065 --> 21:15.858
better or worse?

21:16.650 --> 21:17.317
The same.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.113
Sorry dude.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.823
Okay people!

21:23.657 --> 21:26.326
Who's hungry

21:23.657 --> 21:26.326
for something gooood?

21:27.787 --> 21:28.662
Yeah.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.496
- I am.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.496
Definitely.

21:29.997 --> 21:30.748
Okay, cool.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.458
Because we got...

21:33.584 --> 21:35.044
(both)

21:33.584 --> 21:35.044
Hot yogurt!

21:35.086 --> 21:36.712
All right. Yeah.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.381
Wow, you won

21:37.463 --> 21:39.381
a ho-yo machine?

21:40.507 --> 21:41.217
Yeah, dad.

21:45.972 --> 21:46.639
Hmm.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.389
That's good.

21:48.266 --> 21:51.518
Well, I had a pretty bad day,

21:48.266 --> 21:51.518
but this makes up for all--

21:58.358 --> 21:59.359
Sorry dude.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.103
(bell oven dings)

22:34.145 --> 22:35.313
(Man)

22:34.145 --> 22:35.313
Mmm
