00:34.125 --> 00:36.617
'Are there horses
in the Horse Latitudes?'

00:37.750 --> 00:39.082
'No, sweetheart.

00:40.375 --> 00:44.244
'Story has it that many years ago
when the Spanish sailed to the West Indies

00:44.375 --> 00:46.867
'they brought their horses with them
to the New World

00:47.000 --> 00:51.415
'and sometimes they ran out of wind and
then they ran out of fresh water as well.

00:56.667 --> 01:01.583
'I can only quote the mountaineer
Sir Edmund Hillary himself:

01:01.708 --> 01:04.620
'"Men do not decide
to become extraordinary.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.621
'"hey decide to accomplish
extraordinary things."'

02:16.875 --> 02:20.539
Greetings. Welcome to the 25th
Annual Earls Court Boat Show,

02:20.667 --> 02:23.455
brought to you by "The Sunday Times"
and John Courage.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.700
Speaking of courage, without further ado,

02:25.833 --> 02:28.291
I would like to welcome
one of our greatest heroes,

02:28.417 --> 02:31.910
the first man to single-handedly
circumnavigate the globe,

02:32.042 --> 02:36.116
and now a Knight of the Realm,
Sir Francis Chichester.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.540
Thank you.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.165
Thank you.

02:46.292 --> 02:50.707
So the only thing that I can imagine
that would test a man

02:50.833 --> 02:54.827
more than sailing around the world
in a boat alone,

02:54.958 --> 02:58.827
stopping only once,
is not stopping at all.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.622
And "The Sunday Times"
has asked me here today

03:02.750 --> 03:06.790
to announce just such a challenge.

03:11.875 --> 03:16.700
There will be a cash prize
for the man who comes first,

03:16.833 --> 03:20.656
and a prize for the man who is fastest.

03:21.167 --> 03:25.366
And I believe the details will be
in tomorrow's edition of the newspaper.

03:25.917 --> 03:27.909
Will you be entering, Sir Francis?

03:28.042 --> 03:29.954
No, no, I've had my fun.

03:31.542 --> 03:35.582
Wild horses wouldn't drag me
back to the sinister Southern Ocean.

03:36.917 --> 03:41.833
I believe a man said that the waves there
measured not in feet and inches,

03:41.958 --> 03:44.996
but in increments of fear.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.831
A man alone on a boat

03:49.958 --> 03:53.747
is more alone than any man alive.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.491
Then why would anyone go?

03:55.625 --> 03:57.867
Well, that indeed is a fair question,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.370
because to only do
what has been done before

04:02.500 --> 04:06.494
is to live one's life
in the shadow of other men.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.659
And for that reason alone,

04:09.792 --> 04:13.536
we are blessed by the size of the sea,

04:13.667 --> 04:18.833
and its siren call to men
seeking adventure.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.283
Thank you.

04:28.583 --> 04:32.076
The question that any man
who's dreamed himself beyond the horizon

04:32.208 --> 04:34.951
must ask himself is,
"Where am I going?"

04:35.083 --> 04:38.155
Closely followed, I assume, by,
"How in God's name do I get back?"

04:38.292 --> 04:41.865
Precisely, and this device answers
both of those questions

04:42.000 --> 04:44.333
because it places the latitude
and the longitude

04:44.458 --> 04:46.165
right in the palm of your hand.

04:46.292 --> 04:49.126
The Navicator is every sailor's
most trusted companion,

04:49.250 --> 04:50.832
The Navicator.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.497
Developed and manufactured
by Electron Utilisation of Teignmouth.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.867
Built by us. In our own backyard.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.287
- How does it work?
- It's ingeniously simple.

05:00.417 --> 05:03.080
By comparing signal strengths
of radio beacons on land,

05:03.208 --> 05:04.699
you can tell where you are at sea.

05:04.833 --> 05:08.782
James, over here, is a radio beacon
at Land's End.

05:08.917 --> 05:13.582
And Simon, over here,
is transmitting from La Rochelle.

05:15.375 --> 05:19.870
And you just point the Navicator
and fire like so,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.868
and, hey presto,
you have your position.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.957
And unlike other directional finders,

05:25.083 --> 05:27.917
it has an incorporated compass,
and it is so compact that...

05:28.042 --> 05:30.625
It can be operated
with just one hand.

05:30.750 --> 05:34.699
Leaving this one free to hoist
a spinnaker in a favourable wind.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.620
Or hoist a drink.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.912
The possibilities are endless.

05:39.042 --> 05:42.865
Captain Chichester might've benefitted
from this out in the Roaring Forties.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.370
Perhaps. It appears Sir Francis managed
to find his way around fine without it.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.787
We can't all be Captain Chichester.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.408
Dan...

05:52.083 --> 05:55.042
It's very clever,
but we don't go out to sea much.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.375
We tend to stick more
to the inland waterways.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.328
Thank you.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.994
What sort of vessel do you sail?

06:02.375 --> 06:06.119
I was sure we very nearly
had one there, boys.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.618
Do we need to sell all of them
before we go home?

06:09.750 --> 06:11.742
Be nice to make Mummy happy,
wouldn't it?

06:11.875 --> 06:14.367
Maybe that one looks better
on the stand.

06:24.167 --> 06:27.285
- South-southeast.
- Towards the Azores.

06:27.417 --> 06:30.990
- Gibraltar and beyond that. Africa.
- Oh, shall we go?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.833
- I don't want to go.
- Said we'd meet the Milburns at the pub.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.621
- I guess we'll be late.
- Can we go home instead of Africa?

06:36.750 --> 06:38.082
Which way is home?

06:39.792 --> 06:41.829
Due east. According to the Navicator.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.325
- Very impressive.
- Tell your mother how it works.

06:44.458 --> 06:48.327
The Navicator uses
coastal radio signals...

06:58.500 --> 06:59.786
Is it really finished?

06:59.917 --> 07:03.706
The latest stroke of genius
from Electron Utilisation of Teignmouth.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.905
- And you think there's a market for it?
- Anyone who's lost.

07:07.042 --> 07:09.250
Hm.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.707
It's marvellous.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.746
Someday I'll use the Navicator
to find an island,

07:14.375 --> 07:17.789
or a whole new continent,
like in "Captains Courageous"

07:17.917 --> 07:20.751
Be careful. The boy in that story
fell overboard, remember.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.332
Be careful. Come back here.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.659
The problem is
the entire planet's been handled.

07:25.792 --> 07:28.284
Corners inspected, clouds perused.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.500
Hillary had scaled the heights.

07:30.625 --> 07:33.493
- Scott has braved the Pole.
- Cost him his life, didn't it?

07:33.625 --> 07:35.537
But he made it.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.952
In his diary he said,
"All daydreams must go." Pity that.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.039
"Dreams are the seeds of action."
We'd all do well to remember that.

07:46.042 --> 07:47.374
Prepare to come about.

07:57.375 --> 08:00.868
Read it.
A single-handed race around the world.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.409
- It sounds miserable.
- It sounds profound.

08:04.542 --> 08:07.125
Heroic. Never attempted before.
No stopping this time.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.991
This is the highest rung.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.162
Anyone who enters
needs their head examined.

08:11.292 --> 08:14.831
Examine it till your heart's content.
I've already sent in my entry form.

08:14.958 --> 08:17.075
Clare, did you know this?

08:17.208 --> 08:20.827
Examine it or give it a proper thrashing?
Donald, what do you mean...?

08:20.958 --> 08:24.577
I shall claim the prize for you, my love.
5,000 quid.

08:26.167 --> 08:29.001
Alone on a boat for nine months?
You're either drunk or mad.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.993
We should have another drink,
so that we can rule out madness.

08:32.125 --> 08:35.493
As Chichester said, "Any damn fool
can circumnavigate the world sober.

08:35.625 --> 08:38.413
"It takes a really good sailor
to do it drunk." Same again?

08:39.667 --> 08:40.908
- Why not?
- Yes, please.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.038
- Er, three quid's worth, please.
- All right, sir.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.867
- How's business, Mr Best?
- Huh!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.834
Er, these things seem
to sell themselves.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.204
Everyone wants to go somewhere else,

09:01.333 --> 09:04.041
and have somewhere to sleep
when they get there.

09:04.167 --> 09:07.410
Brilliant product, the caravan.
Makes anywhere your home.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.534
Yes, I suppose it does.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.000
- How far are you going today?
- Staying locally.

09:12.125 --> 09:16.665
- Practising for a longer haul, though.
- Really? Any place in particular?

09:16.792 --> 09:18.624
Round the world.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.124
Hmm.

09:23.250 --> 09:27.244
Darling, may I point out a few things
about this particular adventure

09:27.375 --> 09:28.957
that may prove problematic?

09:30.125 --> 09:33.493
Well, firstly, you don't have a boat
capable of such a voyage.

09:33.625 --> 09:37.164
Not yet,
but such matter is subject to change.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.250
I didn't have a wife at one time.

09:40.375 --> 09:43.539
And now I have a beautiful one.

09:43.667 --> 09:47.411
Secondly, you have never been
much further than Falmouth.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.124
I've also never walked to London,

09:49.250 --> 09:52.322
but I imagine the same stride
I employ daily would carry me there.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.955
Given enough time.
Sailing is no different.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.281
Well, then there is the fact that
this man who is "striding to London"

09:59.417 --> 10:00.749
has a wife and children,

10:00.875 --> 10:03.458
who have come to rely on him
for this roof over their heads,

10:03.583 --> 10:06.496
and plates of food in front of them,
three times daily.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.582
Of course.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.826
But those are the givens in the equation.
One's obligations.

10:13.875 --> 10:18.119
How romantic,
says the "obligation" sitting here.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.242
What have I done in all these years?

10:21.667 --> 10:22.999
Don...

10:29.625 --> 10:31.082
You have done so much.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.783
You've served your country.

10:33.917 --> 10:37.240
You've held a post on the borough council.
You've... invented things.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.413
You've engineered them into existence
from pure imagination.

10:40.542 --> 10:44.206
I don't want to make devices that
allow others to have all the adventures.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.416
All right,
but then what about the company?

10:46.542 --> 10:49.376
What happens to Electron Utilisation
if you just sail away?

10:49.500 --> 10:53.323
Well, consider for just a moment
the recognition of such a voyage.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.781
Would not all that accrue directly
to the value of the company?

10:56.917 --> 10:59.455
- Hmm.
- To us?

10:59.583 --> 11:01.916
Larger house, larger bank accounts.

11:02.042 --> 11:04.250
Oh, Don, we hardly need
a larger house.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.411
More than the material gains,

11:09.542 --> 11:12.614
it would result in children
who are proud of their father

11:12.750 --> 11:15.822
for doing what no other man
in the county would even contemplate.

11:20.042 --> 11:21.999
I think I can win this race, Clare.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.867
'Don's not still talking
about making a boat?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.913
- 'Yes.
- 'Clare, you have to stop him.'

11:35.042 --> 11:40.288
Stop him from... dreaming?
Well, how would you suggest I do that?

11:40.417 --> 11:43.125
'No, not from dreaming.
Dreaming's one thing.'

11:43.250 --> 11:48.291
But leaving in a boat on some sunny day
is quite another.

11:48.417 --> 11:52.036
Well, I have complete faith
that he will wake up from this dream

11:52.167 --> 11:54.875
before that sunny day actually arrives.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.243
- 'He usually does.'
- 'You think he'll change his mind?'

11:58.375 --> 12:01.413
Well, that's what I admire about Don.

12:01.542 --> 12:04.865
He has a mind that's
capable of change.

12:06.042 --> 12:07.783
You want to build a boat?

12:10.042 --> 12:12.580
This boat, it'll be a trimaran.

12:12.708 --> 12:15.075
A three-hulled vessel
based on the Piver design.

12:15.208 --> 12:18.372
It'll feature a treasure trove
of technical innovations,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.366
all pioneered by Electron Utilisation,

12:20.500 --> 12:23.664
incorporating the Navicator
and a dozen other major innovations.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.956
It'll feature an inflatable buoyancy
device at the top of the mast.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.619
So, if she gets into trouble,

12:28.750 --> 12:31.709
the CO2 cartridge is triggered
by the capsizing event,

12:31.833 --> 12:34.826
shoots up the mast,
and inflates the buoyancy bag at the top.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.371
So if she goes over,
she'll just pop back up again.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.493
Without question,
it'll be the fastest boat in the race.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.116
We enter it in the Golden Globe.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.368
The biggest sailing race ever
becomes our advertising campaign.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.832
"We" enter it?

12:46.958 --> 12:49.746
I didn't come here
asking for charity, Mr Best.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.366
I'm offering something new.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.537
- Who pilots the boat?
- I do.

12:53.667 --> 12:57.115
You? Have you ever done anything
like that before?

12:57.250 --> 13:00.368
No, but that's the point.
That's the business proposition.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.914
If I can do it, then so can the bloke
who stares at the horizon in wonder.

13:04.042 --> 13:05.908
If I'm putting in the money...

13:09.208 --> 13:10.665
...what are you putting in?

13:10.792 --> 13:12.328
Everything else.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.159
So you're not really a sailor?

13:18.292 --> 13:21.035
Seems to me
the act of sailing makes one a sailor.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.911
How about you, Mr Hallworth?
How did you come to be a press agent?

13:26.333 --> 13:30.031
Oh, I was a reporter for a time.
A crime reporter.

13:30.167 --> 13:34.081
So your experience as a press agent
appears to rival that of mine as a sailor?

13:34.208 --> 13:35.744
TouchÃ©, Mr Crowhurst.

13:35.875 --> 13:39.698
But, you see, publicity can be done
from the safety of a desk chair

13:39.833 --> 13:43.656
whereas your competitors have a great deal
more experience at the helm of a boat.

13:43.792 --> 13:48.366
Nobody has experience of sailing round
the globe single-handed without stopping.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.823
And the proof of that is the simple fact
it has not been done before.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.699
It's a good point, that.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.702
Yes, but then there's, you see,
for example, there's this Frenchman.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.870
- Moitessier.
- Moitessier.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.323
Now he sailed from Tahiti to Cape Horn,
through the Southern Ocean.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.747
Two of these other bastards rowed
a bloody boat across the Atlantic.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.912
Another commanded a submarine
in the war.

14:09.042 --> 14:13.207
Moitessier, Knox-Johnston, Tetley and
the others, they're accomplished sailors.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.576
- But when I win the Golden Globe...
- You can't think you're going to win?

14:16.708 --> 14:18.870
Making it out to sea
is a feat for you, isn't it?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.959
Chichester averaged
131 miles a day in his ketch.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.076
I believe I can make 200 in a trimaran.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.495
I tell you what I see
when I look at you, Donald.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.618
I see a part of England that's been lost.

14:31.750 --> 14:35.414
The intrepid part that Churchill convinced
us of when the bomb were falling.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.625
That "never say die" England.

14:38.250 --> 14:42.415
I tell you, you're a story of derring-do
waiting to be told, Donald Crowhurst.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.491
When do you set sail?

14:45.625 --> 14:49.414
Well, the rules of the race state that
competitors leave by October 31st.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.078
So, before then.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.575
- And how will you go?
- The clipper route.

14:53.708 --> 14:58.453
Down the Atlantic past Cape of Good Hope
and into the Southern Ocean.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.326
Not really a place
for our little Pot Of Gold.

15:01.458 --> 15:05.407
Streaking across the Roaring Forties
south of Australia, north past Cape Horn,

15:05.542 --> 15:07.829
and back into the Atlantic again.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.745
Trudging across the Horse Latitudes

15:09.875 --> 15:13.243
before getting a last puff
from the Westerlies.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.991
Wow! What an adventure!

15:15.833 --> 15:20.282
So far we've got plenty
of tinned goods from Crosse & Blackwell.

15:20.417 --> 15:24.707
We've got a commitment from Whitbread
for barley wine. Looks nice.

15:24.833 --> 15:29.624
Now, also, the BBC are going to provide
you with a camera and tape recorder.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.073
They're wanting you to keep an audio
and visual record for a film piece

15:33.208 --> 15:35.621
- they're planning on your voyage.
- Film?

15:35.750 --> 15:38.663
They want you keep
a daily written account, as well,

15:38.792 --> 15:41.535
so you'll come back
a sailor and an author.

15:41.667 --> 15:45.240
Golden Globe, slate one, take one.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.997
Your husband will be gone for six months
with only intermittent contact.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.333
Is that daunting to you?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.573
I'm going to need you
to send me frequent updates.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.916
I can drum up all the publicity
and whatnot,

16:02.042 --> 16:04.500
but I want you to help me feed the beast.

16:05.292 --> 16:06.499
The beast?

16:07.250 --> 16:12.291
Well, naturally, I shall miss him because
he's the most marvellous company, but...

16:12.417 --> 16:16.331
Well, I told myself it's only six months,
and we're going to manage in that time.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.618
And I have no reservations whatsoever
about his safety,

16:19.750 --> 16:24.165
because he's the sort of person
who will think of 1,001 ways

16:24.292 --> 16:25.749
out of any situation.

16:27.792 --> 16:32.287
I want you to make it real for all of us.
The wind, the waves, the whales, the...

16:32.417 --> 16:33.749
All of it.

16:34.917 --> 16:37.876
We're going to make you famous.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.289
'The third competitor of the
Golden Globe race, Robin Knox-Johnston,

16:41.417 --> 16:42.828
'is leaving today.'

16:43.458 --> 16:46.576
'The Golden Globe trophy
will be offered to the first person...'

16:46.708 --> 16:49.826
He's leaving today,
and we're not even in the water yet.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.666
He may get back before I do,
but the question remains,

16:52.792 --> 16:55.205
who can make the trip the fastest?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.199
So, when are we leaving?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.787
August at the latest.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.992
Don't want to give them all
too much of a head start.

17:03.125 --> 17:06.117
I am not going
to ask Mr Best for more money.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.082
That's out of the question.

17:08.208 --> 17:12.156
With all the new ideas, we seem
to be getting further and further behind.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.038
Are you telling me August 1st
is no longer possible?

17:16.166 --> 17:18.534
- Don, it never really was.
- September 1st?

17:18.666 --> 17:21.034
Aiming for October 1st,
more realistically.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.410
Or we need to put more people on,
double our shifts.

17:24.541 --> 17:27.501
- No, no. The success of the project...
- Associated costs...

17:27.625 --> 17:28.957
No!

17:29.750 --> 17:31.412
Two more left this morning.

17:31.542 --> 17:34.990
I don't believe any of the three can
average more than 4.5 knots per day.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.744
Maybe 100 miles. Lucky to complete
the route in less than 300 days.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.709
- And you?
- Closer to nine knots and as high as 15.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.995
That's the great advantage
of the trimaran.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.618
130 days for the entire trip.
So, a departure in October...

17:47.750 --> 17:52.916
What, October? It's October now?
What happened to September?

17:55.833 --> 17:59.326
We've had delays.

17:59.458 --> 18:02.951
But we can still make the deadline
with one last push. We're close.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.287
How much more money do you need?

18:08.417 --> 18:10.704
This amendment
commemorates the new agreement

18:10.833 --> 18:12.449
between you and Mr Best.

18:12.583 --> 18:16.122
If you fail to complete
"The Sunday Times" race,

18:16.250 --> 18:20.369
he is entitled to the deeds
to your property at Higher Brimley Road,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.366
in addition to the previous agreement,

18:22.500 --> 18:26.790
involving the rights and assets
of the Electron Utilisation Corporation.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.582
You understand, Donald.

18:30.417 --> 18:33.125
I just need some assurances that...

18:34.458 --> 18:36.916
...we're not throwing
good money after bad.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.333
Are you sailing around in your brain?

19:14.542 --> 19:16.078
I was, erm...

19:18.375 --> 19:20.037
I was talking to Mr Best.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.332
And, and we decided that...

19:36.292 --> 19:37.658
We decided...

19:39.250 --> 19:42.493
...we'd push the departure day
back a couple of weeks.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.325
So, not October 1st.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.165
No, a little later.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.450
Is that still safe?

19:58.125 --> 20:00.993
Donald, are you really going to go?

20:01.125 --> 20:02.866
That's still the plan.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.582
I see.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.407
Do you know, I think I fooled myself into
thinking we were just building a boat?

20:13.542 --> 20:16.740
I... I didn't think
I'd actually have to...

20:18.292 --> 20:20.329
...watch you sail away on it.

20:23.042 --> 20:25.580
It's what boats do. They sail away.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.040
But then they sail back again.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.120
Will you promise me that?

20:35.708 --> 20:37.665
I won't have you worry.

20:37.792 --> 20:39.749
- Never.
- Hmm.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.040
That's good to hear.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.332
What's happening?

21:05.542 --> 21:07.329
Well, we're, we're up against it.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.409
Er, yes,
Don, now we, we haven't managed

21:13.542 --> 21:16.580
to get our hands on the preferred
rubber gaskets for the hatch covers.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.616
The best ones come from a supplier
in Scandinavia in my experience.

21:21.750 --> 21:25.744
It seems they are completely out.
We've had to go with second choice. Sorry.

21:26.333 --> 21:30.907
Well, second choice hardly seems like
optimal circumstances from which to begin.

21:31.042 --> 21:35.116
No, well, I would prefer
a bit more time to get things right.

21:35.250 --> 21:38.618
It's not really an option, is it,
more time?

21:38.750 --> 21:40.992
The calendar does not negotiate.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.458
In my experience, nor does the ocean.

21:43.583 --> 21:47.452
Tomorrow's the last day.
Are you ready?

21:48.458 --> 21:49.915
Hmm.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.035
Well, I don't think there are
too many things of any importance

21:53.167 --> 21:54.999
that will remain undone.

21:55.125 --> 21:59.825
Erm... I'm not lacking
in any great respects.

21:59.958 --> 22:02.541
There's nothing essential
that's missing.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.829
'Face it, Don.
The boat isn't ready.'

22:05.708 --> 22:07.040
Don...

22:09.083 --> 22:11.120
You don't have to do this.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.205
Here's to the good people
at Whitbread,

22:17.333 --> 22:21.327
who have been kind enough
to put beer in bottles for your voyage.

22:21.458 --> 22:26.453
- Hope you don't run out.
- Er, yes, well, about all that. I...

22:26.583 --> 22:29.246
I wanted to say, with a heavy heart...

22:30.958 --> 22:34.326
...that I all think we gave it a good go.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.791
There were unforeseen events,

22:36.917 --> 22:40.661
unexpected cost overruns
on this project.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.990
If we'd had a couple more weeks,
I think we would've made our mark.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.959
- Maybe even come out on top.
- Don...

22:47.083 --> 22:49.951
My suggestion is
I leave in the spring instead.

22:50.083 --> 22:53.531
Not as part of the race,
obviously that won't be possible,

22:53.667 --> 22:56.080
but we can still make a big splash
with the new boat.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.042
Make Mr Best here his money back,
and then some.

22:59.167 --> 23:00.499
Don...

23:01.625 --> 23:07.417
I think on the eve of his departure,
any sane man would want to pull out

23:07.542 --> 23:09.625
of such an endeavour.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.867
I think your apprehensions are...

23:12.000 --> 23:15.619
Well, they're normal, they're healthy,
and if you didn't have them,

23:16.167 --> 23:19.285
then I'd be truly concerned for you.

23:20.167 --> 23:24.537
And I'm sure you've contemplated
the consequences, if you withdrew,

23:24.667 --> 23:26.954
reneging on the contracts
with your sponsors,

23:27.083 --> 23:29.951
to say nothing of your arrangements
with Stanley here.

23:30.083 --> 23:31.699
I'd hate to, er, enforce it.

23:31.833 --> 23:35.656
Handing over your house
and Electron Utilisation in full.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.829
Nobody wants to see that come to pass.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.745
I don't. Stanley here doesn't.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.286
No. No, no, I don't.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.750
And nor do the people of Teignmouth,

23:43.875 --> 23:46.242
who have invested their hearts
in your mission.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.492
Leave your doubts with us,
here on the shore.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.537
Take your dreams out to sea.

23:52.125 --> 23:55.118
Ultimately, you know,
it's your decision.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.491
You're the one taking the risk.

25:47.542 --> 25:50.285
Oh, Mr Crowhurst,
how are you feeling?

25:50.417 --> 25:53.125
Hello, everyone.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.082
We need to come.

26:12.167 --> 26:13.578
Right, this way.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.666
I'll just introduce you
to the, er, Mayor.

26:19.042 --> 26:20.908
Donald Crowhurst.

26:22.417 --> 26:25.160
Morning, Mr Crowhurst.
The very best of luck.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.624
Lady wife.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.124
Good luck, Donald.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.367
Er, keep in touch.
You're looking dashing.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.162
Erm, rugged even.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.913
- Stanley.
- Godspeed, Donald.

26:38.042 --> 26:39.533
I shall think of you daily.

26:39.667 --> 26:44.082
Last few words, sir?
Sir? Mr Crowhurst?

26:57.708 --> 27:00.325
Why don't you wave, children? Wave.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.290
You too, Donald.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.911
All right. Hold on tight.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.540
Come on, children. Come.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.415
Mind your fingers.

27:59.333 --> 28:02.246
Looks like a damn hurricane hit it...

28:03.375 --> 28:05.287
...before I've even gone a mile.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.454
What's that rope for?

28:13.583 --> 28:17.998
Well, in case I get a clumsy moment
and stumble over the side,

28:18.125 --> 28:21.368
I can pull myself back in
with this trailing line,

28:22.125 --> 28:24.788
before the boat circumnavigates
without me.

28:24.917 --> 28:28.706
But that's not going to happen,
because you won't be falling in, will you?

28:29.417 --> 28:31.534
Can I come aboard?

28:31.667 --> 28:33.249
Not a good idea just now.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.949
You're free now.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.576
Goodbye! Good luck, Daddy!

28:43.708 --> 28:45.370
Bye, everyone!

30:43.667 --> 30:44.874
Christ!

31:31.250 --> 31:33.082
Oh, bloody hell.

31:56.458 --> 31:59.451
Is there a part of the voyage
that most excites you?

31:59.583 --> 32:02.326
Well, I suppose that would have
to be the day of my return.

32:05.833 --> 32:10.498
Hello? This is Donald Crowhurst
calling from New Zealand.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.584
'I'd like to speak to a girl
in England called Rachel Crowhurst.'

32:13.708 --> 32:16.872
- Erm, putting you through. Ring, ring.
- Hello?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.617
- Hello?
- A call from the middle of the ocean.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.242
'For Miss Rachel Crowhurst?'

32:22.375 --> 32:23.991
Can I still tell you secrets?

32:24.125 --> 32:25.741
Er, yes, you can tell me secrets,

32:25.875 --> 32:28.538
but just be aware
that Portishead is on the line.

32:32.917 --> 32:35.375
I think you're going to win.

32:38.833 --> 32:42.873
'I'd say it was going
swimmingly, but that'd scare your mother.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.834
'Let me tell you a little bit
about turning eight years old.'

32:46.833 --> 32:49.200
You'll learn many new things.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.916
You'll learn just
how much you don't know at all.

32:52.042 --> 32:55.365
You'll find the same thing happens
when you get to my age, as well.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.537
'I want you to have
the happiest of birthdays.'

32:58.458 --> 33:01.906
And know that I am with you
in every possible way.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.743
- Will you bring me back a seahorse?
- Let me speak to Daddy.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.947
Hello, darling. Is it going well?
Not missing us too much?

33:09.083 --> 33:10.995
Oh, just working out the kinks here.

33:11.125 --> 33:15.039
'Foreseen and otherwise, you know.
Not unlike your trials there, I'm sure.'

33:16.292 --> 33:18.124
'How's the weather?'

33:20.583 --> 33:21.915
Hello, Clare?

33:22.042 --> 33:23.408
'Hello?'

33:23.542 --> 33:25.534
Yes, we're all here. Yes. Hello?

33:25.667 --> 33:29.160
- Hello? Hello, Clare?
- 'Hello?'

33:29.292 --> 33:33.115
'If you can hear me, I should probably
sign off. Crack on with the work.'

33:33.250 --> 33:35.913
Much love to you
and to all assembled.

33:36.042 --> 33:37.624
Say goodbye to Daddy.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.707
Goodbye, Daddy! We love you!

33:39.833 --> 33:44.157
Erm, when will we hear
from you again, Don? Donald?

33:44.292 --> 33:47.490
'Sorry, Mrs Crowhurst.
This is Portishead. We lost the signal.'

33:47.625 --> 33:50.368
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Portishead.

33:51.292 --> 33:53.079
Well, that was lovely.

33:54.125 --> 33:56.117
Hello, hello, hello, hello. Ooh!

33:57.125 --> 33:59.868
The recording level needs
to be tweaked down a bit.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.083
Hello, hello. Try that.

34:02.875 --> 34:07.040
Er, so here I am, in the North Atlantic
in the middle of November,

34:07.167 --> 34:10.001
making tape recordings for the BBC.

34:11.292 --> 34:13.909
I've been at sea now
for very nearly 14 days.

34:14.542 --> 34:18.581
On my way to a rendezvous
with Cape Horn.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.705
'The thing that most people

34:23.833 --> 34:26.371
'is glorious afternoons in The Solent.'

34:26.500 --> 34:28.411
Pretty girls in bikinis,

34:28.542 --> 34:33.161
lounging about on the decks
of some vast schooner,

34:33.292 --> 34:36.080
while men stand
with natty yachting gear,

34:36.208 --> 34:39.531
clasping the wheel with a pipe
clenched firmly between their teeth.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.618
'Unhappily, I've never encountered them.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.036
'Everything on this boat is wet.'

34:47.167 --> 34:48.533
Not damp. Wet.

34:48.667 --> 34:52.911
'Condensation forms on the roof, drips
in your ear when you're trying to sleep,

34:53.042 --> 34:54.748
'every hole is a potential leak,

34:54.875 --> 34:59.495
'and the noise of the wind is continuous,
and often deafening.

35:03.542 --> 35:06.614
'A great deal of pressure
falls on the man alone on a boat.

35:09.042 --> 35:12.535
'with a penetration that very few
other occupations can manage.

'I've never put out to sea in such
a completely unprepared state in my life.

35:21.417 --> 35:22.749
'I have problems still.'

35:24.458 --> 35:29.078
But I have a fairly long spell
in the trade winds ahead,

35:29.208 --> 35:32.952
'in which I will endeavour
to get this boat ready...

35:34.792 --> 35:38.035
'...for her great ordeal

Oh, no! Not this!

36:25.708 --> 36:30.578
'"Silence due engine

"Going on toward Madeira."

36:43.708 --> 36:45.040
Madeira's Portugal.

36:45.167 --> 36:48.535
I know where Madeira is,
thank you very much.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.624
Right...

36:50.750 --> 36:54.869
Honestly, he's got, what,
a transmitter and a phone.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.411
All we get is this.

36:56.542 --> 36:58.750
Where's the storms?
Where's the sea monsters?

36:58.875 --> 37:01.333
Maybe he's making
more careful notes in the logs.

37:01.458 --> 37:05.077
- What is this? Stripped mag... what?
- Magneto. The generator, I believe.

37:06.292 --> 37:09.205
Should we say anything?
He's headed for Madeira at least.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.665
Are you serious?

37:10.792 --> 37:16.117
He's been headed for Madeira
for, what, the past three weeks.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.866
Hasn't he?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.208
The others are rounding Africa.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.501
Blast! No, Donald, you're not on holiday.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.791
Not north! What is wrong with you?

38:13.625 --> 38:15.241
What the hell is that?

38:42.792 --> 38:45.751
'The float has
proved to be quite vexing.'

38:45.875 --> 38:48.162
And I still haven't found
a satisfactory answer

38:48.292 --> 38:50.784
to the problem of getting air
into the main cabin

38:50.917 --> 38:52.624
without letting in a lot of water.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.493
So I worry about suffocating in my sleep.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.789
Not, not to mention
the, erm, the electronics.

38:58.917 --> 39:03.207
It's been hard to finish when one is busy
bailing out water all day to stay afloat.

39:03.333 --> 39:05.541
'At the back of mind
there's still the nagging suspicion

39:05.667 --> 39:07.533
'that the starboard float could split.'

39:07.667 --> 39:10.990
You sound discouraged, Don.
Very disheartened.

39:11.125 --> 39:14.323
These matters would've been
better resolved on dry land.

39:14.458 --> 39:17.246
And if the goal was
to highlight certain advances,

39:17.375 --> 39:19.867
the trimaran as the Caravan of the Sea
and so forth,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.583
we're not putting our best foot forward.
Over.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.786
'Is that it then?'

39:26.125 --> 39:28.833
Are you calling to say
it's time to retire?

39:29.750 --> 39:32.288
'Looks like we're at that crossroads.'

39:33.917 --> 39:36.625
Every day out here
is a crossroads, Mr Best.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.533
Over.

39:39.667 --> 39:44.037
'Shall I inform your family and Rodney
of your decision?

39:44.167 --> 39:46.454
'Are you turning back?'

39:53.000 --> 39:54.332
Don?

39:56.958 --> 40:01.407
Actually, I'm calling to say
that I fully intend to press on.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.619
Would you relay that to my wife?
Tell her all is well.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.537
Listening out.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.492
'Can't we come with you?'

40:13.625 --> 40:16.618
If anyone comes
on the boat with me, I'm disqualified.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.286
Has to be me and me alone.

40:18.417 --> 40:22.661
What happens
if there's a storm, like this?

40:22.792 --> 40:24.533
Then I'll be in the storm.

40:24.667 --> 40:27.125
Won't you get scared alone?

40:29.917 --> 40:32.955
You know, whenever I get scared,

40:33.083 --> 40:37.202
I'll just think of the next time
we're able to be together instead.

40:38.083 --> 40:42.327
'Whenever you get scared,
I want you to think about the same thing.

40:42.458 --> 40:45.576
'People who are thinking about
the same thing are always connected.

40:46.833 --> 40:49.371
'No matter how far apart they are.'

42:11.292 --> 42:13.750
Oh, good God. Not the buoyancy bag?

42:21.208 --> 42:22.824
Oh, God.

43:55.125 --> 43:57.868
'My buoyancy bag
is now broken beyond repair.

44:00.458 --> 44:02.666
'So if I capsize...

44:04.208 --> 44:06.040
'...that will be it.'

44:38.167 --> 44:40.580

with the boat in so many respects.

44:40.708 --> 44:44.076
'My chances of survival,
if I continue into the Southern Ocean,

44:44.208 --> 44:46.700
'would not be better than 50-50.'

44:47.708 --> 44:50.746
'Shall I give Daddy
the present now?

44:50.875 --> 44:55.199
'This is something to remember us by.
It's just a little bit of home.'

44:58.542 --> 45:01.250
Goodness me. It's...

45:01.375 --> 45:03.913
- It's a toaster.
- Ah.

45:04.042 --> 45:06.580
Course it is.

45:06.708 --> 45:08.290
How splendid.

45:09.375 --> 45:12.868
We all thought when you're sitting
down to have your breakfast,

45:13.000 --> 45:17.825
a million miles from here,
it will be as if we're all there with you.

45:20.625 --> 45:24.995
Do you like it, Dad?
It's from all of us. We all chose it.

45:30.625 --> 45:34.323
Well, it's good reason
to keep the generator in working order.

45:34.458 --> 45:35.869
Thank you.

45:37.208 --> 45:39.450
I think Daddy likes his toaster!

'Mike, Zulu, Uniform, Whisky,
Teignmouth, Electron.'

46:10.750 --> 46:12.662
This is Portishead radio.

46:12.792 --> 46:15.125
I regret to inform you there is no answer.

46:15.250 --> 46:18.869
'Would you like me to ring your wife
back later with a message? Over.'

46:21.167 --> 46:24.285
Would you tell her... that I'm well?

46:27.208 --> 46:28.540
Out.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.417
'If I turn back, I face certain ruin.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.663
'The loss of the company, the house.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.082
What if I tell them I'm...

47:06.042 --> 47:07.374
...here?

47:28.833 --> 47:31.041
Would they believe me?

47:35.250 --> 47:37.742
What a bloody awful decision.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.408
I think you should
take a look at this.

47:58.542 --> 48:03.788
"Hurtled south 172 miles."

48:03.917 --> 48:07.115
Crowhurst continues
to streak south,

48:07.250 --> 48:09.287
leaving his difficulties behind.

48:09.417 --> 48:12.125
He got it sorted. He's on his way now.

48:12.250 --> 48:16.415
Saturday, 172 miles. Sunday, 109.

48:16.542 --> 48:19.410
'Monday, 145.

48:19.542 --> 48:24.207
'Even the porpoises are left
breathless by his speed.'

48:24.917 --> 48:26.658
'243 miles?'

48:26.792 --> 48:30.490
A new single-handed record.
That's faster than Chichester!

48:30.625 --> 48:34.665
Having passed the Equator
and into the springtime,

48:34.792 --> 48:37.284
Donald Crowhurst is somewhere
in the South Atlantic

48:37.417 --> 48:39.704
averaging an astounding
170 miles a day.

48:39.833 --> 48:43.702
The speed of the Teignmouth Electron
is nothing short of electric.

48:43.833 --> 48:46.371
Sure you want "electric"
and "electron" in the same sentence?

48:46.500 --> 48:47.832
Oh, give over.

48:47.958 --> 48:52.453
Is nothing short of electric, as his
daily totals surpass all the competitors,

48:52.583 --> 48:55.747
even those of the great
Sir Francis Chichester himself.

48:55.875 --> 48:58.868
- Sir?
- 'There. Send it.'

48:59.000 --> 49:01.868
- Seen the latest on Donald Crowhurst?
- Donald Crow who?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.333
The last Globe entrant.
Bloke from Teignmouth.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.165
Oh, dim recollection.

49:06.292 --> 49:10.241
Just received this from his press agent.
Turning into quite a story.

49:11.708 --> 49:14.826
Faster than Chichester?
Remarkable.

49:14.958 --> 49:18.531
Er, give me 500 words
on this Donald Crowhurst for tomorrow.

49:18.667 --> 49:20.454
Mm-hm. Thanks.

'What sort of attitude
is required to sail a boat solo?'

49:43.167 --> 49:47.537
'Well, I think
one's psychology has to be fairly stable,

49:47.667 --> 49:52.537
'and one has to be constantly aware
of the risks one is running.'

49:52.667 --> 49:55.865
And a willingness to improvise
if circumstances dictate.

- 'Portishead Station.'
- It's Portishead!

- 'Donald Crowhurst for Mrs Crowhurst.'
- Happy Christmas, Father!

51:38.958 --> 51:41.701
'And to all of you.
You sound much older, James.'

51:41.833 --> 51:44.667
I've only been gone two months.
You're already a man.

51:44.792 --> 51:46.328
'Over.'

51:47.250 --> 51:48.786
Oh, happy Christmas.

51:49.250 --> 51:52.163
'I am so sorry, but you don't have
your presents with you,

51:52.292 --> 51:55.706
'because in the mad rush to leave,
somehow they got left off the boat.'

51:55.833 --> 51:58.871
And then Stanley found them on the dock,
and he dropped them off.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.868
- Can I open them?
- Yes.

52:04.792 --> 52:08.456
You know, sometimes,
I find myself talking to you in my head.

52:08.583 --> 52:12.406
'Then I have to stop myself from talking
out loud when I realise you're not there.'

52:14.792 --> 52:18.661
Well, we're all... thrilled
by your progress.

52:19.208 --> 52:22.827
Most impressed.
It's all over the papers.

52:26.083 --> 52:30.077
Is it? Yes, well, I'd like to talk to you
about that at some point.

52:30.208 --> 52:32.040
Are you nearing the Cape?

52:33.333 --> 52:35.791
Portishead, are you on the line?
Over.

52:37.750 --> 52:41.664
'Yes, sir. This is
Portishead operator. Can I help you?'

52:42.958 --> 52:45.291
No, nothing.
Just thought the signal was fading.

52:45.417 --> 52:48.489
'Yes, the Cape's out there, waiting.'

52:48.625 --> 52:51.038
He's nearing the Cape.

52:52.250 --> 52:55.038
Fougeron is out.
There's only four racers left.

52:55.167 --> 52:57.705
And you're quicker than all of them.

52:59.333 --> 53:03.782
We knew Moitessier and Knox-Johnston
were the ones to watch. Over.

53:03.917 --> 53:07.115
All of the teachers and boys at school,

53:07.250 --> 53:10.823

they're all keeping track.

53:10.958 --> 53:14.030

It's... it's all...

56:01.500 --> 56:02.991
sailed by Donald Crowhurst,

56:03.125 --> 56:05.367
is in trouble in the Indian Ocean.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.911
A large wave has smashed...

56:07.042 --> 56:10.911
No, an enormous wave
has smashed into the stern,

56:11.042 --> 56:13.534
and damaged the radio gear
and the superstructure...

56:13.667 --> 56:15.909
- But he didn't say that.
- Hey, button it.

56:16.042 --> 56:20.286
Erm, now, because the generator
is now inaccessible,

56:20.417 --> 56:23.251
Mr Crowhurst fears
he will be out of contact with loved ones

56:23.375 --> 56:25.367
for the most perilous part of his journey.

56:25.500 --> 56:28.698
- I don't understand.
- I know. If you did, you'd have my job.

56:28.833 --> 56:33.203
Look, his last missive said, er...
Where is it? Here we go.

56:33.333 --> 56:36.076
"Stricken gout
after New Year's sherry party.

56:36.208 --> 56:40.498
"Now equal footing...mermaids."

56:40.625 --> 56:42.366
Eh? Shall we print that?

56:42.500 --> 56:46.494
Think that'll cheer up the sponsors?
Bloody mermaids? Send it.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.992
'He's gaining on Tetley.

56:49.125 --> 56:51.788
'May make a race of it yet.
Another 500 words?'

56:52.708 --> 56:57.408
Mmm, yes. Sadly sounds like we won't
be hearing from him for a while.

56:57.542 --> 56:59.625
Maybe you could do more on the wife.

56:59.750 --> 57:03.243
- He has quite a following.
- I'll get Hallworth to set something up.

57:04.792 --> 57:06.658
How did you first meet Donald?

57:06.792 --> 57:10.456
Well, erm...
he walked up to me at a party,

57:10.583 --> 57:12.791
and he told me he could see my future,

57:12.917 --> 57:15.500
and that I would marry
an impossible man,

57:15.625 --> 57:17.161
but I would be greatly loved.

57:18.417 --> 57:20.454
And then the next day
he asked me out,

57:20.583 --> 57:23.075
and then the day after that as well,

57:23.208 --> 57:26.997
and he told me he would never
leave my side, and he never did.

57:27.750 --> 57:29.582
But now he has.

57:29.708 --> 57:32.951
Well, for good reason.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.951
You can't sail round the world
by sitting in your living room.

57:36.083 --> 57:38.291
And Clare knows that. She...

57:39.208 --> 57:41.746
Look, she couldn't
have been more supportive.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.868
Do you worry about him
being in the South Seas?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.788
'Well, I think that wives and mothers
have been worrying

57:47.917 --> 57:49.499
'as long as men have been sailing.'

57:49.625 --> 57:53.198
So, yes, worrying does take up
a fair part of the day,

57:53.333 --> 57:55.165
and a good portion of the night.

57:55.292 --> 57:57.750
- Mummy, it's freezing.
- Ooh!

57:57.875 --> 57:59.707
Rub your hands.
Give them a good rub.

57:59.833 --> 58:03.281
How do the children feel about him
being in a hostile world?

58:07.042 --> 58:09.409
I would prefer not do
that kind of thing ever again.

58:11.833 --> 58:14.576
Clare, love, listen.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.576
We can't give the public
the man right now.

58:17.708 --> 58:20.746
So it's up to the rest of us
to take up the slack, fill in the blanks.

58:20.875 --> 58:23.367
Is that what we are? Blanks?

58:23.500 --> 58:25.958
Look, it's your husband's job
to sail that boat.

58:26.083 --> 58:29.247
'It's my job to make sure
that everybody else knows about it.'

58:29.375 --> 58:33.745
I can't make things easier for him
while he's out there.

58:33.875 --> 58:37.198
'I wish that I could, but I have
every intention of making all our lives

58:37.333 --> 58:39.370
'as easy as possible upon his return.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.492
So, today, you helped
to make him famous.

58:41.625 --> 58:45.949
I don't care if my husband's famous.
I... care that he's safe.

58:52.667 --> 58:54.033
Fuck!

58:54.167 --> 58:55.578
I knew it!

59:00.958 --> 59:03.746
'You've got no choice.'

59:08.125 --> 59:09.832
I have no choice.

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:33.659
'I don't want to go.'

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:36.705
'Don't go. Stay with us.'

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:40.031
But if you don't go, I don't want you
to regret that decision either,

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:42.454
and I fear that you will.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.291
'You see,
it's not Rodney or Stanley that...

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:50.124
'...I worry about you disappointing.'

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:53.120
Or even me.

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:56.074
It's you.

01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:59.200
Nobody else matters to me.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.408
Good morning.

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.078
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

01:01:59.292 --> 01:02:03.491
I am Petty Officer Santiago Franchessi
of the Coastguard of Argentina.

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:08.115
The Teignmouth Electron is your boat?

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:12.576
I'm surprised you haven't heard
about the race.

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:15.416
I started here in a town
called Teignmouth.

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:18.250
Then the clipper route
round the tip of Africa.

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:22.790
The plan was to go round the world without
stopping. Hence no need for a passport.

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:26.451
How do we know you
are telling the truth?

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:29.200
Well, I have a film camera as well.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:32.246
If we could develop the negative,
I could show you the images.

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:35.539
Africa, the Roaring Forties,
New Zealand.

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:47.500
If you will stay here for a moment.

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:26.621
'I'm so sorry.'

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.412
I'm sure they told you everything.

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:48.333
May I call my wife?

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:50.666
- Let's go.
- Where are you talking me?

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.328
To your boat.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.906
I had to check
that you are not a, er... smuggler.

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:10.660
We will get you
what you need for your boat.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.620
'He's out! He's out!'

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:35.618
He was almost back and now he's out!
He's going round again.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.208
- What are you talking about? Who?
- The Frenchman!

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.199
- He's withdrawn from the race.
- What?

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.167
'Father only has
Tetley and Knox-Johnston to beat.

01:04:43.292 --> 01:04:48.287
'It's in the paper. Moitessier's out!
Simon, Rachel, the Frenchman's out!'

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:51.956
'"I am continuing non-stop
back to the Pacific Islands.'

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:55.622
"I am happy at sea,
and I want to save my soul."

01:04:57.375 --> 01:05:01.369
'What does the salt water do
to these men's brains?'

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:21.744
'Tetley has to take the prize.
Too much noise.

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:25.323
'No one will look at the logbooks
of the last man home.

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:27.791
'I have to be last.

01:05:33.042 --> 01:05:35.659
'Too many questions.
It's my only way back.'

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:42.783
'But where is back?'

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:55.124
'For Robin Knox-Johnston,
an impressive voyage of 312 days

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:57.708
'without setting foot on dry land.

01:05:57.833 --> 01:06:01.497
'He remains 86 days shy
of Chichester's speed record,

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:04.038
'but wins the Golden Globe
as the first man

01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:06.955
'to circumnavigate the world
without stopping.'

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:10.326
Didn't see him covering 200 miles in a day
like Captain Crowhurst.

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:11.790
Exactly!

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:16.412
'Nigel Tetley and Donald Crowhurst
are the two competitors still at sea.

01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:19.125
'The coveted title of fastest
is still in the offing.'

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.708
And no one is faster than Donald.

01:06:23.042 --> 01:06:27.286
'Look at his smile!
He really is enjoying being home!'

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.409
To Robin Knox-Johnston!

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.745
Bless the man.

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:55.201
'And when was
the family's last income?'

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.868
Well, he's been gone
for, er, almost six months now,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.741
but, erm, even before he left,

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:04.039
he wasn't really earning
a significant amount of money.

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:06.659
- Gone? lllness?
- No, no. Nothing like that.

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.499
But he's expected back?

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.413
- Yes, definitely.
- 'Any idea when?'

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:22.414
I've actually brought some, er...
bank statements to show you.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:27.952
So, if I understand correctly, I think
we're eligible for a clothing allowance

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:30.166
and free school dinners.

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:37.416
We have three children at home.

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:41.326
'Of course all of this will change
once my husband returns.'

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:44.656
Do you know where your husband is,
Mrs Crowhurst?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.037
Mike, Zulu, Uniform, Whisky.

01:07:55.167 --> 01:07:58.456
Mike, Zulu, Uniform, Whisky.
Teignmouth, Electron. Over.

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:03.243
'Q-T-H, <i>por favor</i>. Q-P-R? Over.'

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:05.367
Who is this? Over.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.244
'This is General Pacheco Radio
of Buenos Aires.

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.992
'Sir, what is your latitude
and longitude?'

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:18.370
Heading Digger Ramirez.
Repeat, heading Digger Ramirez.

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.323
Excuse me.

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:33.578
We've heard from Portishead.

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:35.665
He's alive!

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:38.205
- What?
- Yeah.

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:41.826
- He's rounded the Horn.
- Are you serious?

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:44.746
Yeah, he's just passed
the Diego Ramirez islands!

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:47.073
God!

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.541
Where does that put him now then?

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.410
I knew he could do it!
Take that, Tetley!

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:56.501
Could he place a call to us? Yes.

01:08:56.625 --> 01:09:00.618
Of course. No, of course I understand.
Oh, well, thank you so much, Portishead.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:04.993
I believe this is the best phone call
I have... ever received in my life.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:07.037
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:11.332
Oh, my goodness. Your father is... off
the coast of Argentina and heading north.

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:15.452
And with any luck he should be home...
before the end of June!

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:19.953
Oh, my goodness! Come here! Oh!
Show me the islands. Where are they?

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:22.450
He's the fastest around Cape Horn.

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:25.621
Remarkable.
Mr Hallworth must be over the moon.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:29.948
Hmm. If he keeps it up, he'll log
the fastest circumnavigation ever.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.120
And he's just a hobbyist.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.582
What a story.

01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:35.448
The triumph of the underdog.

01:09:35.582 --> 01:09:38.075
Must have old Chichester
scratching his head.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:40.325
Give me 1,000 words on Crowhurst.

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:44.497
'I imagine "Heading Digger Ramirez"
will certainly be three of 'em.'

01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:06.700
'Only two weeks behind Tetley.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.491
'Photo finish will make great news.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:13.786
'Fill your sails.'

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:18.870
'I think you're going to win.'

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.618
'No. No, can't do that.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:26.333
'They'll be too much noise.
Too many questions.

01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:30.372
'Tetley has got to win.
I have to be the last man home.'

01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:38.159
Godspeed, Nigel Tetley!

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:28.285
'Are there horses
in the Horse Latitudes?'

01:12:28.417 --> 01:12:29.953
'No, sweetheart.'

01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:35.452
'Story has it that many years ago
when the Spanish sailed to the West Indies

01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.950
'they brought their horses with them
to the New World,

01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:42.532
'and sometimes they ran out of wind,
then they ran out of fresh water as well.'

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:45.501
Which gave them
a very difficult choice to make.

01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:47.582
Men or horses?

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.787
Are you taking a horse?

01:12:50.917 --> 01:12:53.409
No, but I'm taking
plenty of fresh water with me.

01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:29.575
'- He's out.
- 'Who?'

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:31.540
Tetley. Tetley's out!

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:33.329
- He is?
- Yes!

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:34.915
How did that happen?

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:39.332
Well, listen, the story is,
he heard Donald was gaining on him,

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:43.532
he's overplayed his hand, he's pushed
his own boat too hard, and he's capsized!

01:13:43.667 --> 01:13:46.785
- Does Donald know?
- Yes, of course he knows!

01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:49.125
So do the BBC, so do "The Times",

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:53.290
and soon, if it's got owt to do with me,
soon so will most of England.

01:13:53.417 --> 01:13:56.660
Clare, listen, listen.
He's the only one left now!

01:13:56.792 --> 01:14:00.160
Now, not to celebrate
Mr Tetley's misfortune,

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:02.830
but now that we know
that he's safe and sound,

01:14:02.958 --> 01:14:06.076
I think we'd like to pause
and reflect for a moment.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.949
Reflect...

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:10.871
Oh, my goodness me!

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.994
The family of a hero
doesn't reside on the dole.

01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:17.458
Indeed. So...

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:22.248
To Donald Crowhurst, soon to become
the world's fastest circumnavigator.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.992
Hmm. To Donald.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.208
- To Donald!
- To Donald.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.948
Yes, Buenos Aires,
I would like to make the call directly

01:14:36.583 --> 01:14:38.825
to the United Kingdom, Teignmouth.

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:42.247
Higher Brimley Road. Clare Crowhurst.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:45.868
- From her husband. Over.
- 'Trying through New York.'

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.244
No, not through New York.
I would like privacy if possible. Over.

01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:52.992
'We are unable to reach Portishead.'

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.866
No, not through Portishead.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.573
No, Teignmouth directly.
When I asked yesterday...

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:02.954
'Not sure we copy.'

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:08.332
A direct link, please.
That is what I requested. Over.

01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:11.371
'We cannot establish a landline
connection from Buenos Aires.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.662
'We will try again through New York.'

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:17.750
Thank you. Listening out.

01:15:21.833 --> 01:15:23.540
So what do I do now?

01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.870
'I needed Tetley to come home!'

01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:30.416
I'm out here alone now!

01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:33.995
I have to talk to you!

01:16:51.917 --> 01:16:54.955
Front page, "Sunday Times"!

01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:57.953
"Before he left Teignmouth,

01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:00.871
"Donald Crowhurst was little more
than a weekend sailor.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.707
"He was unknown.

01:17:02.833 --> 01:17:06.122
"Many club-tie yachtsmen
thought his strangely shaped boat

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:08.788
"would sink or turn back
before Land's End."

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:12.410
George...
There he is! Eh? Mouthy.

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:16.286
"Today his name is
added to the famous."

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:17.749
Bloody marvellous.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.992
"And behind that brief statement
is a story

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:24.369
"almost as long as the gruelling
29,000 miles he travelled.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.538
"A story packed
with courage, self-discipline,

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:30.205
"and an unswerving belief
in his own capabilities."

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:32.199
"The Sunday Times"!

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:33.915
That's not local!

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.458
That's not a local paper.
That's from London!

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:41.532
Anyway, all raise your drinks, and...
Tell you what, they're on Ian.

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:44.034
Young Ian here.

01:17:52.292 --> 01:17:56.992
No. No, you have to stay
away from me.

01:17:57.125 --> 01:18:00.493
- This is Mike, Zulu, Uniform, Whisky.
- Teignmouth Electron.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.912
- Read me?
- 'Imagine us there with you.'

01:18:03.042 --> 01:18:06.456
- Mike, Zulu, Uniform, Whisky.
- Teignmouth Electron.

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.324
Do you read me? Over.

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:13.031
'This is Halifax station.
Please identify. Over.'

01:18:13.167 --> 01:18:16.956
I'm trying to reach my wife,
Clare Crowhurst of Teignmouth. Over.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:23.199
'Halifax Station.
Please identify. Go to channel...'

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.249
'Careful, Donald!

01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:33.453
'Donald?'

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.163
'Who are you?'

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.745
Who are you?

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:45.413
'You are a cosmic being.

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:50.121
'What is your sin?

01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:57.455
'What is your sin?

01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:04.209
'Who are you?'

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:09.494
'I'm a cosmic being.'
'A cosmic being.'

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:11.833
'A cosmic being.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.333
'A cosmic being.'

01:19:25.542 --> 01:19:29.240
Crosse & Blackwell want
photos and statements.

01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:31.992
BBC and ITV are sending helicopters.

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:33.866
Why has he not written?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.573
I've scheduled the press conference
at the Carlton per your instructions.

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:40.621
Just need to give them an exact date.
I'm predicting July 3rd.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:42.958
Upstage the Americans
and their astronauts.

01:19:43.083 --> 01:19:46.576
All we need is another
couple of those 200-mile days.

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:49.246
How is it he can't find five minutes

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:52.038
to give us an estimate
of when he'll arrive?

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:55.365
Maybe there's another problem
with the radio?

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.288
Oh, look, it's going up.
Look, look. "Welcome home, Donald."

01:19:58.417 --> 01:20:01.956
- Oh, it's looking good.
- Oh, it's smashing. Think he'll like it?

01:20:02.083 --> 01:20:06.748
'During his lifetime each man
plays cosmic chess with the devil.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:13.917
'It's difficult to know who's winning,
because God plays with one set of rules,

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:19.907
'and the Devil plays with the other
exactly opposite set of rules.

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:24.364
'But one thing is clear.

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:27.575
'The only real sin...

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.950
'...is the sin of concealment.'

01:21:58.458 --> 01:22:00.165
'Wait for me!'

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:04.165
Can you see him?

01:22:04.292 --> 01:22:06.079
- Wait!
- Yes?

01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:09.076
- I see something!
- What do you see?

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:13.076
- Oh, it's a cloud.
- Oh, dear. Let me have a look.

01:22:14.333 --> 01:22:16.541
I think he'll be back on 21st.

01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:18.875
The same day the Americans
arrive on the moon.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.744
- I want him back tomorrow.
- Oh, me too, sweetheart.

01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:25.663
You have a look.
See what you can see.

01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:32.740
- There's something sort of there.
- What do you think it is?

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:36.073
I don't know.
It doesn't look like the trimaran.

01:22:38.042 --> 01:22:39.749
'Clare?'

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.746
I thought I could play the game better.

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.286
I tried.

01:22:57.625 --> 01:23:00.242
But in the end,
I was forced to admit that nature...

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.914
...forces on cosmic beings
the only sin that they're capable of.

01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:08.991
The sin of concealment.

01:23:20.292 --> 01:23:24.115
Darling, I'm the only man on Earth
who understands what this means.

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:30.540
Over.

01:23:59.042 --> 01:24:00.783
Come home.

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:04.578
I can't.

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.957
There's no way back.

01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:17.375
I can't write stories
of where I've never been.

01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:30.540
I'm something else now.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:56.289
It's 10:28... nine seconds.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.499
The only beauty...

01:25:09.042 --> 01:25:10.374
...is truth.

01:25:11.917 --> 01:25:13.954
I am what I am.

01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:21.250
And I see the nature of my offence.

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.666
I'm so sorry.

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:41.038
I hope you can forgive me.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.287
It's finished.

01:26:45.292 --> 01:26:47.124
It's finished.

01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:03.200
It is the mercy.

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:23.114
This is exactly
how we found her.

01:29:34.667 --> 01:29:35.999
Hmm.

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:39.245
There's the logbooks, eh?

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.700
Left 'em out like that.
In plain sight.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.742
Suppose he could've
thrown 'em overboard.

01:29:47.375 --> 01:29:49.162
Yes.

01:29:49.292 --> 01:29:52.035
But he didn't, did he?

01:29:59.125 --> 01:30:02.289
As far as I can tell,
the poor bastard never rounded the Cape,

01:30:02.417 --> 01:30:04.283
or crossed the dateline.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.117
Looks like he invented the whole thing.

01:30:09.208 --> 01:30:13.031
It seems he gives up
after Commander Tetley goes over.

01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:15.159
Stops sailing.

01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:18.791
I'll tell you
what I think's happened here.

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:22.245
He never had any intention of winning.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:25.826
Yeah. He never planned
on being held to account.

01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:28.996
Who looks at the logbooks
of the last man home?

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:31.994
Think about it.

01:30:33.417 --> 01:30:35.249
"It is finished.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:38.742
"The mercy."

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:49.866
What "mercy"?

01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.787
Has Clare seen these?

01:31:02.833 --> 01:31:05.325
Her husband wanted to be famous.

01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:10.246
Well, now he's about to be.

01:31:28.042 --> 01:31:31.740
I can see that you've all come
to inspect the damage,

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:34.993
to take a picture, write a story.

01:31:36.292 --> 01:31:38.955
Perhaps you'd all like a word
from the bereaved widow.

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:41.245
Is that what you've come
scavenging for? Yes?

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:44.539
- Yes, please.
- All right, well, write this down.

01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:48.456
I don't know if my husband
slipped and fell,

01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:51.417
or if he jumped...
as you're now saying.

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:57.203
But I would like you to rest assured,
that if he did jump, he was pushed.

01:32:00.125 --> 01:32:03.948
And each and every one of you here
had a grubby hand on his back.

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:07.906
Every photographer,
every sponsor, every reporter,

01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:11.410
every sad little man
who stands at a newsstand

01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:14.285
to feast on the scraps
of another's undoing.

01:32:15.667 --> 01:32:18.034
And once he was in the water,

01:32:18.167 --> 01:32:21.740
you all held him under
with your judgement.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:25.949
Last week you were selling hope,
now you're selling blame.

01:32:26.083 --> 01:32:28.496
Next week you'll be selling
something else.

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:33.701
But tomorrow and every day after,

01:32:33.833 --> 01:32:37.247
my children will still need their father.

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:39.913
And I will still need my husband.

01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:44.166
I'm afraid that doesn't make
a particularly good story,

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:48.115
but then I suppose
the truth rarely does.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.866
Thank you very much.

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:14.082
'My most fervent desire
is that you never see this writing.

01:33:14.208 --> 01:33:17.042
'If you ever do, it will mean
that by pursuit of my own ends

an intolerable burden on you.

How long do we wait?

01:33:58.292 --> 01:34:01.251
You don't have to decide
when to stop waiting.

01:34:02.542 --> 01:34:04.909
Your heart will do that for you.

01:34:07.417 --> 01:34:09.909

Even the parts you don't understand.

01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:45.956
Because that's what you do for someone
you love who has gone away.
