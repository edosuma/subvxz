WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.417
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:03.629 --> 00:05.540
We agreed to give
each other the summer.

00:05.715 --> 00:07.205
No calls, no texts.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.791
- How many are there?
- A pack of them. An Alpha pack.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.925
They have Boyd and Erica,
and I hear there's a leader.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.381
He's called Deucalion.

00:15.099 --> 00:16.680
Quiet. You hold on tight.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.096
You're Allison, right?
Where's Scott?

00:19.312 --> 00:20.677
Lydia.

00:39.582 --> 00:41.618
I don't know.
It doesn't look like much to me.

00:41.834 --> 00:42.994
It's a pattern. It means something.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.376
You really think
Scott's gonna know what it is?

00:45.588 --> 00:46.919
No, but he might know someone who does.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.172
How are you so sure
that it means anything at all?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.375
Because that girl wasn't
just looking for Scott.

00:52.595 --> 00:53.926
It's like she needed to find him.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.929
Like she had to. And that means something.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.481
What?

01:04.690 --> 01:05.850
What do you mean "what"?

01:06.067 --> 01:07.432
I mean "what," and you know what.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.563
- "What" what?
- That look you were giving.

01:09.779 --> 01:10.859
I didn't give a look.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.812
- There was a distinct look, Scott.
- What look?

01:13.032 --> 01:14.943
The look that says that the last
thing you feel like doing right now

01:15.117 --> 01:16.197
is going to a party.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.365
It's not that.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.990
It just seems a little weird
going to a different high school's party.

01:20.164 --> 01:23.873
What? Would you... Oh, my God, one
drink, all right? You'll be fine.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.871
I went to nursery school
with this girl, okay?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.873
She promised
to introduce us to all of her friends.

01:28.089 --> 01:31.422
So tonight, no Allison, no Lydia.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.920
Tonight, we're moving on.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.178
- You're right.
- That's right I'm right.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.379
Moving on.

01:38.558 --> 01:40.344
Onward and upward.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.515
Let's do this.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.887
That's what I'm talking about.
Now look at me.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.139
Okay.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.601
- How's my breath smell?
- I'm not smelling your breath.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.353
- Do you have any gum?
- No. No gum. You're fine.

01:49.569 --> 01:50.979
Can you at least
tell me what kind of party this is?

01:52.989 --> 01:54.570
It's my birthday!

01:54.782 --> 01:55.771
Mmm-hmm!

01:56.993 --> 01:58.199
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:58.411 --> 01:59.400
Tonight.

01:59.579 --> 02:00.864
- Really, tonight?
- Yeah.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.160
- For real?
- Yeah.

02:02.373 --> 02:05.410
You know, your first time
is usually sort of gross, and it kind of hurts.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.581
That's fine with me.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.706
No romance? No waiting to fall in love?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.708
When I fall in love, I want to be good at it.

02:11.924 --> 02:15.883
Lord. You at least got
yourself a target of opportunity?

02:16.095 --> 02:17.881
Stiles! Hi.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.010
Hey.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.046
There's the birthday girl...

02:23.102 --> 02:24.888
- So glad that you made it.
- Me, too.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.890
Come downstairs with me
and help me pick out a bottle of wine.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.095
Yes.

02:33.946 --> 02:34.981
Hey.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.043
- Shut the door.
- Okay.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.881
Hey, remember when we were little kids

02:56.093 --> 02:59.426
we used to come down here
all the time and then...

03:03.643 --> 03:05.884
Yeah, we never did that.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.388
Stiles,

03:09.940 --> 03:11.441
| just turned 17 today.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.725
- Mmm.
- And you know what I want for my birthday?

03:14.070 --> 03:15.310
A bike?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.861
To not be a 17-year-old virgin.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.790
Have you never done it before either?

03:31.087 --> 03:33.328
Turned 17? No, not yet, no.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.337
Stiles?

03:37.343 --> 03:39.254
Yeah, maybe that other thing, too.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.051
Do you want to?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.049
I mean, would you be okay with that?

03:44.475 --> 03:48.013
Would I be okay with that?
I believe so, yeah. Um...

03:48.229 --> 03:50.185
- Okay.
- No, yeah, very...

03:55.069 --> 03:57.230
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.611
I don't have any...

03:58.823 --> 04:01.485
My brother has some
in the upstairs bathroom.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.024
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.193
- Okay.
- You should go get them. Go.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.451
- Going.
- Go.

04:21.554 --> 04:24.136
This isn't the talk we were gonna have, is it?

04:27.977 --> 04:29.183
I need to show you something.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.321
Where are the condoms?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.235
Where are the condoms?

04:51.417 --> 04:53.123
Yes! Yes! Yes!

05:20.988 --> 05:22.023
Stiles?

05:36.253 --> 05:37.504
Okay, this isn't funny.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.851
Okay. Only got one.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.059
I figured, you know,
if we needed more, I could...

06:45.906 --> 06:46.895
Heather?

07:53.349 --> 07:55.305
You know, I'm starting not to like this idea.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.300
Sounds kind of dangerous.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.354
You know what?
I definitely don't like this idea,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.685
and I definitely don't like him.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.101
You'll be fine.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.571
Does it have to be him?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.866
He knows how to do it. I don't.

08:15.079 --> 08:18.037
Be more dangerous if I tried doing it myself.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.784
You know Scott doesn't trust him, right?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.415
You know, personally, I'd...
Well, I'd trust Scott.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.578
Do you trust me?

08:27.883 --> 08:28.838
Yeah.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.843
I still don't like him.

08:34.223 --> 08:35.963
Nobody likes him.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.551
Boys.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.897
FYI, yes, coming back from the dead

08:46.110 --> 08:48.601
has left my abilities somewhat impaired,

08:49.071 --> 08:50.436
but the hearing still works.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.105
So I hope you're comfortable saying

08:53.325 --> 08:56.283
whatever it is
that you're feeling straight to my face.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.948
We don't like you.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.115
Now shut up and help us.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.449
Fair enough.

09:08.007 --> 09:10.589
Relax. I'll get more out of you if you're calm.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.130
How do you
know how to do this, again?

09:14.346 --> 09:16.382
It's an ancient ritual used mostly by Alphas,

09:16.557 --> 09:20.015
since it's a skill that requires
quite a bit of practice.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.559
One slip, and you could paralyze someone.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.180
But you've had
a lot of practice, though, right?

09:27.151 --> 09:29.233
Well, I've never paralyzed anyone.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.527
Wait, does that mean that you...

09:49.256 --> 09:50.621
Wait, I see them.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.198
What'd you see?

10:23.082 --> 10:24.367
It was confusing.

10:25.334 --> 10:29.077
Um, images. Vague shapes.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.120
But you saw something.

10:32.091 --> 10:33.752
Isaac found them.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.750
Erica and Boyd?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.677
I barely saw them. I mean, glimpses.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.596
But you did see them.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.810
And worse.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.851
Deucalion.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.855
He was talking to them.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.525
Something about time running out.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.021
What does it mean?

11:01.870 --> 11:02.859
He's gonna kill them.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.162
No, no, no, no, he didn't say that.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.365
He did make them a promise

11:07.584 --> 11:09.870
that by the full moon
that they'd both be dead.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.418
The next full moon?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.041
Tomorrow night.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.050
I don't see anything.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.468
Look again.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.718
How is a bruise
gonna tell me where Boyd and Erica are?

11:28.105 --> 11:29.515
It's the same on both sides.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.725
Exactly the same.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.854
It's nothing.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.601
Pareidolia.
Seeing patterns that aren't there.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.604
It's a subset of apophenia.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.323
They're trying to help.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.488
These two?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.493
This one, who used me
to resurrect my psychotic uncle.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.662
Thank you. And this one,

11:50.878 --> 11:52.869
who shot about 30 arrows
into me and my pack.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.498
Okay, all right, now, come on.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.875
No one died, all right?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.672
Look, there may have been a little maiming,

11:57.843 --> 11:59.879
okay, a little mangling, but no death.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.881
That's what I call an important distinction.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.553
My mother died.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.264
Your family's
little honor code killed your mother.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.431
Not me.

12:07.603 --> 12:09.059
That girl was looking for Scott.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.432
I'm here to help him, not you.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.058
You wanna help?

12:13.275 --> 12:14.435
Find something real.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.353
Give her a chance.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.942
Okay, they're on our side now.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.148
Well, then maybe you should tell her

12:23.368 --> 12:26.781
what her mother
was actually trying to do that night.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.958
Okay, what would a pack of
Alphas want with Erica and Boyd?

12:34.171 --> 12:36.162
I'm not sure it's them they want.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.758
Okay, what, like Derek?
Like, they're recruiting?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.386
Hey, Scott.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.058
You coming?

12:59.905 --> 13:01.861
The stock market

13:02.074 --> 13:04.315
is based on two principles.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.066
What are they?

13:07.246 --> 13:08.986
Yes, McCall, you can go to the bathroom.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.699
Anybody else?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.034
No, Coach, I know the answer.

13:17.839 --> 13:18.999
Oh, you're serious.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.922
Yes. Risk and reward.

13:21.134 --> 13:25.252
Wow! Who are you?
And what have you done to McCall?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.505
Don't answer that. I like you better.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.056
I like you better.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.971
Does anybody have a quarter?

13:32.187 --> 13:34.052
- A quarter.
- Yep.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.812
Stilinski, I think you...

13:45.075 --> 13:46.190
You dropped this.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.199
And congratulations.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.569
Risk and reward.

13:50.789 --> 13:55.158
Put the quarter in the mug, win the reward.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.664
Okay, watch Coach.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.093
Huh? Huh?

14:07.597 --> 14:08.848
That's how you do it.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.308
Okay. Danny.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.757
Risk, reward?

14:11.935 --> 14:12.970
What's the reward?

14:13.729 --> 14:15.390
You don't have to take
the pop quiz tomorrow.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.642
Coach, it's not a pop quiz
if you tell us about it.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.809
Danny, you know,
I really expect more from you at this point.

14:22.029 --> 14:22.984
Really.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.938
McCall. Risk, reward?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.867
The risk,

14:28.076 --> 14:29.862
if you don't put that quarter in the mug,

14:30.078 --> 14:32.490
you have to take the pop... The quiz.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.867
And you have to write an essay.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.415
Risk, more work.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.041
Reward,

14:40.547 --> 14:41.878
No work at all.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.591
Or choose not to play.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.961
- But isn't this just chance?
- No.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.294
You know your abilities, your coordination,

14:48.513 --> 14:50.549
your focus, past experience.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.929
All factors affecting the outcome.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.895
So what's it gonna be, McCall?

14:56.104 --> 15:00.438
More work, no work, or choose not to play?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.394
No play.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.106
Okay. Who's next?

15:09.326 --> 15:10.862
Who wants the quarter?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.569
There you go! There's a gambling man!

15:13.789 --> 15:16.280
Come on! Step up, step up.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.706
All right, Stilinski.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.878
- Stiles.
- Yeah, Coach, I got it.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.037
Stiles.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.256
I couldn't find her.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.963
I just figured
she'd hooked up with her other friends.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.844
Has no one really seen her since last night?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.182
No.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.101
We put out an APB, but...

15:39.272 --> 15:41.354
Stiles, all her friends
say you were the last person who saw her.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.480
Me?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.937
We hope that
it's just a series of bad decisions

15:45.153 --> 15:46.404
based on too much to drink.

15:47.072 --> 15:51.486
But if you remember anything
else, you call me. All right?

15:53.161 --> 15:54.276
Yes!

15:54.496 --> 15:55.451
Reward!

15:55.664 --> 15:57.200
Okay, who's next?

15:57.416 --> 15:59.623
Greenberg, put your hand down.
You don't have a chance.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.587
I want one.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.135
Which one?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.884
The straight one, obviously.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.703
What if it's not a symbol?

16:38.874 --> 16:40.739
What if it's actually a logo?

16:56.641 --> 16:58.177
So you think they
kidnapped Heather to turn her?

16:58.393 --> 16:59.929
Derek says it's easier to turn teenagers.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.604
But what would
a pack of Alphas need with a Beta?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.098
Scott, I don't know. I don't care.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.896
All right? This girl...

17:05.066 --> 17:06.897
Our moms were best friends
before mine died, all right?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.899
We used to take freaking
bubble baths together when we were three.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.447
I gotta find her.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.907
Then we need Isaac to remember.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.905
How? Peter and Derek couldn't do it.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.658
You know
any other werewolves with a better trick?

17:17.871 --> 17:19.987
Maybe not a werewolf.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.038
But someone who knows a lot about them.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.676
Obviously, it's not going to be particularly...

17:37.098 --> 17:38.554
Comfortable.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.553
But if we can
slow your heart rate down enough,

17:40.769 --> 17:43.226
you'll slip into a trance-like state.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.313
Like being hypnotized.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.313
Exactly. You'll be half transformed.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.396
It'll let us access your subconscious mind.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.614
How slow does his heart rate need to be?

17:57.452 --> 17:58.407
Very slow.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.736
Okay, well, how slow is very slow?

18:00.956 --> 18:01.945
Nearly dead.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.793
Do you want me to answer honestly?

18:11.466 --> 18:13.002
No. No, not really.

18:19.808 --> 18:20.843
What?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.773
Look, if it feels too risky,
you don't have to do this.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.348
Get him back under.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.237
- Hold him.
- We're trying!

19:45.602 --> 19:48.389
Now, remember, only I talk to him.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.188
Too many voices
will confuse him and draw him out.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.651
Baac?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.278
Can you hear me?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.028
Yes.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.038
I can hear you.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.451
This is Dr. Deaton.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.629
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Is that all right?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.046
Yes.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.881
I want to ask you about the
night you found Erica and Boyd.

20:24.391 --> 20:28.259
I want you to remember it
for me in as vivid detail as possible,

20:29.104 --> 20:30.810
like you're actually there again.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.980
I don't wanna do that.
I don't wanna do that.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.147
I don't wanna do that.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.400
Isaac, it's all right. Just relax.

20:37.612 --> 20:38.647
They're just memories.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.403
You can't be hurt by a memory.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.695
- I don't wanna do that.
- It's all right.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.863
I don't wanna do that.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.191
Relax.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.571
Relax.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.035
Good.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.912
Now let's go back to that night.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.957
To the place you found Erica and Boyd.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.623
Can you tell me what you see?

21:00.093 --> 21:02.505
Is there some kind of building?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.214
A house?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.590
It's not a house. It's stone.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.844
- I think marble.
- That's perfect.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.226
Can you give me any other descriptors?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.309
It's dusty, so empty.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.611
Like an abandoned building?

21:23.074 --> 21:24.029
Baac?

21:26.077 --> 21:27.863
- Isaac?
- Someone's here.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.028
Someone's here.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.408
Isaac, relax.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.115
No, no, no, no. They see me, they see me!

21:37.255 --> 21:38.995
Just memories.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.298
You won't be hurt by your memories.
Just relax.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.044
Relax.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.924
Good.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.351
Now tell us what you see.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.024
Tell us everything.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.456
But I can't control it.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.121
Neither of us will.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.336
I hear him.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.880
He's talking about the full moon,

22:23.092 --> 22:24.923
about being out of control
when the moon rises.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.092
Is he talking to Erica?

22:27.305 --> 22:29.045
I think so, I can't...

22:30.391 --> 22:34.054
I can't see her. I can't see either of them.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.015
Can you hear anything else?

22:38.566 --> 22:40.102
They're worried,

22:40.819 --> 22:43.151
worried what they'll do during the moon.

22:43.738 --> 22:47.526
They're worried
that they're gonna hurt each other.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.238
If they're locked in together
on the full moon,

22:51.412 --> 22:52.447
they're gonna tear each other apart.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.742
Isaac, we need to find them right now.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.662
- Can you see them?
- No.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.587
Do you know
what kind of room it is?

23:04.092 --> 23:05.548
Is there any kind of a marker?

23:06.261 --> 23:08.001
A number on a door?

23:08.263 --> 23:09.252
A sign?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.885
They're here.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.726
- They're here. They're here.
- It's all right.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.807
No. They're here.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.024
Just tell us...

23:24.237 --> 23:26.319
They see me. They found me. They're here!

23:26.489 --> 23:27.774
This isn't working. Isaac, where are you?

23:27.991 --> 23:29.197
I can't see them. It's too dark!

23:29.409 --> 23:30.865
- Tell me where you are.
- I can't see!

23:31.077 --> 23:33.284
- You're going to confuse him.
- Isaac, where are you?

23:40.920 --> 23:41.955
Just tell me where you are.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.082
His heart rate... He could go into shock.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.334
Derek, let him go!

23:45.550 --> 23:47.165
Isaac, where are you? What did you see?

23:50.179 --> 23:52.090
A vault! It's a bank vault!

23:57.145 --> 24:00.012
I saw it! I saw the name.

24:07.405 --> 24:10.818
It's, uh, Beacon Hills First National Bank.

24:11.576 --> 24:12.861
It's an abandoned bank,

24:13.077 --> 24:15.614
and they're
keeping them locked inside the vault.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.039
What?

24:24.672 --> 24:27.880
You don't remember what you said
right before you came out of it, do you?

24:28.718 --> 24:29.707
No.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.676
You said when they captured you

24:32.847 --> 24:34.929
that they dragged you into a room

24:35.141 --> 24:37.052
and that there was a body in it.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.968
What body?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.013
Erica.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.024
You said it was Erica.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.817
She's not dead.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.859
Derek, he said,
"There's a dead body. It's Erica."

24:56.079 --> 24:58.161
Doesn't exactly
leave us much room for interpretation.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.829
Then who was in the vault with Boyd?

25:00.041 --> 25:01.406
Someone else, obviously.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.576
Maybe it was the girl on the motorcycle.
The one who saved you?

25:04.796 --> 25:06.377
No, she wasn't like us.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.708
And whoever was
in the vault with Boyd was.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.416
What if that's how Erica died?
They pit them against each other

25:11.594 --> 25:14.085
during the full moons
and see which one survives.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.636
It's like werewolf thunderdome.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.012
Then we get them out tonight.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.590
Be smart about this, Derek.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.599
You can'tjust go storming in.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.844
If Isaac got in, then so can we.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.271
But he didn't get
through a vault door, did he?

25:25.692 --> 25:26.852
We need a plan.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.103
How are we gonna come up with a plan

25:28.319 --> 25:30.810
to break into a bank vault
in less than 24 hours?

25:30.989 --> 25:31.944
Uh, I think someone already did.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.614
"Beacon Hills First National closes its doors
three months after vault robbery."

25:35.827 --> 25:36.862
Doesn't say here how it was robbed,

25:37.078 --> 25:38.284
but it probably won't take long to find out.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.532
- How long?
- It's the Internet, Derek.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.706
Okay? Minutes.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.549
Boys.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.309
Hey, time to wake up.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.013
Boys.

26:08.818 --> 26:09.898
Boys!

26:13.156 --> 26:16.398
I got to get to work. You two get to school.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.651
Dad! Heather?

26:20.747 --> 26:22.203
No, nothing yet.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.462
Ten hours and nothing.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.835
We're gonna find something.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.879
Finding something
doesn't make Erica any less dead

26:32.091 --> 26:33.831
or Boyd any less about-to-be dead.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.337
Well, we still have time.

26:35.511 --> 26:39.220
Is this whole "remain optimistic in the face
"of complete and utter disaster" thing

26:39.432 --> 26:41.423
a part of the
"be a better Scott McCall" program?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.430
Not if it doesn't work.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.897
No, it works.

26:50.777 --> 26:54.019
Oh, Dad! Dad? Dad!

26:57.658 --> 26:59.865
So mystery girl leaves a bruise on our arms

27:00.078 --> 27:02.615
that turns out to be the logo for a bank?

27:02.830 --> 27:05.287
What's she trying to do?
Give us investment advice?

27:05.500 --> 27:07.912
Not at this bank. It's been closed for years.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.334
Why aren't you telling Scott?

27:11.089 --> 27:14.752
Because according to someone,
I need to find something real.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.667
Which reminds me, um,

27:18.721 --> 27:22.839
I can't drive you home today.
I have an errand to run after school.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.801
All right, so we meet
at Derek's at 5:00 to go over the plan,

27:27.021 --> 27:28.227
and then we don't get started until dark.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.849
Okay. What do we do till then?

27:30.066 --> 27:32.022
What, right now? We've got English.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.381
Okay. You see this?

28:01.597 --> 28:04.885
This is how they got in.
It's a rooftop air conditioning vent.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.808
Leads down inside
into the wall of the vault, which is here.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.306
Okay?

28:09.605 --> 28:11.345
One of the robbers
was lowered into this shaft.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.855
Now, that space is so small,

28:13.067 --> 28:16.150
it took him about 12 hours to drill
into that wall, which is stone, by the way.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.567
Then throughout the rest of the night,

28:17.780 --> 28:20.157
they siphoned the cash
up to the guys back on the roof

28:20.366 --> 28:22.573
through that
one little shaft in the wall. Boom.

28:22.785 --> 28:23.740
Can we fit in there?

28:23.953 --> 28:25.568
Yes, we can, but very, very barely.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.282
And they also patched the wall, obviously,

28:27.498 --> 28:28.829
so we're gonna need a drill of some kind.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.451
I'm thinking maybe a diamond bit...

28:30.668 --> 28:32.249
Look, forget the drill.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.621
Sorry?

28:33.796 --> 28:36.037
If I go in first, how much space do I have?

28:38.301 --> 28:39.586
What do you think you're gonna do, Derek?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.341
You gonna punch through the wall?

28:41.721 --> 28:43.962
Yes, Stiles, I'm gonna
punch through the wall.

28:44.182 --> 28:45.797
Okay, big guy.
Let's see it. Let's see that fist.

28:46.017 --> 28:47.132
Big, old fist. Make it, come on.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.602
Get it out there. Don't be scared.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.346
Big, bad wolf. Yeah, look at that.

28:50.521 --> 28:53.103
Okay, see this?
That's maybe three inches of room

28:53.274 --> 28:56.437
to gather enough force
to punch through solid...

28:56.652 --> 28:57.607
Aah!

28:58.279 --> 28:59.314
Aah!

28:59.822 --> 29:00.982
He could do it.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.360
I'll get through the wall.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.487
Who's following me down?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.285
Don't look at me.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.703
I'm not up to fighting speed yet,

29:09.916 --> 29:11.656
and honestly, with Isaac out of commission,

29:11.834 --> 29:13.244
you're not looking
at very good odds for yourself.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.334
So I'm supposed to just let them die?

29:15.546 --> 29:16.706
One of them is already dead.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.462
We don't know that.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.881
Do I have to remind you
what we're up against here?

29:21.594 --> 29:24.256
A pack of Alphas. All of them killers.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.884
And if that's not enough to scare your
testicles back into your stomach,

29:27.099 --> 29:28.555
try to remember that two of them

29:28.768 --> 29:31.054
combine bodies to form one giant Alpha.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.390
I'm sure Erica and Boyd were sweet kids.
They're gonna be missed.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.102
Can someone kill him again, please?

29:39.570 --> 29:41.856
Derek, seriously,

29:42.907 --> 29:44.488
not worth the risk.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.154
What about you?

29:47.370 --> 29:49.861
- Yeah, if you want me to come...
- Not you.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.070
Scott.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.498
I don't know about Erica.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.543
But if Boyd's still alive,
we have to do something.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.881
We have to try.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.049
But?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.043
Who's the other girl?

30:09.809 --> 30:11.845
The one locked in there with Boyd?

31:30.890 --> 31:31.845
Ms. Morrell?

31:32.058 --> 31:33.514
Keep your mouth shut, and listen close.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.512
You have no idea
what you just stepped into.

31:35.728 --> 31:38.185
Right now you've got maybe 20 seconds
to get your ass hidden.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.012
- What are you doing?
- Get in that storage closet over there.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.221
Lock the door.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.978
When you hear the fighting start,
that's when you come out.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.814
- What fighting?
- You'll hear it. Now, go!

33:20.082 --> 33:23.290
I can't take waiting around like this,
you know? It's nerve-racking.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.413
My nerves are racked.
They're severely racked.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.165
Racked.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.838
I could beat you unconscious
and wake you when it's over.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.136
You think Erica's really dead?

33:33.304 --> 33:35.090
You think I really care?

33:35.306 --> 33:37.171
I just...
I don't understand the bank, though, okay?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.256
Like, why wouldn't they chain them up

33:39.477 --> 33:40.887
in some underground lair or something?

33:41.187 --> 33:43.269
They're an Alpha pack, right?
So shouldn't they have a lair?

33:43.439 --> 33:45.976
They're werewolves, not Bond villains.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.850
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

33:49.904 --> 33:51.986
Maybe they're living there. You know?

33:52.198 --> 33:56.612
Like, maybe the bank vault
reminds them of their little wolf dens.

33:56.827 --> 33:57.907
Wolf dens?

33:58.078 --> 33:59.113
Yeah, wolf dens.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.577
Where do you live?

34:01.540 --> 34:04.077
In an underground network of caves
hidden deep in the woods.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.329
- Whoa, really?
- No, you idiot.

34:07.004 --> 34:09.245
I have an apartment downtown.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.924
Okay, fine, but still, that just proves

34:11.091 --> 34:12.706
that there's something up with the bank.

34:12.927 --> 34:14.758
And why wait around for the full moon, huh?

34:14.970 --> 34:16.676
Why not just kill them
whenever they want to?

34:17.515 --> 34:19.722
Maybe they think it's poetic.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.637
They've already had
three full moons to be poetic.

34:22.853 --> 34:26.971
And here you've
only had one full hour to be so annoying...

34:27.149 --> 34:28.685
No, go ahead, finish what you were saying.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.812
I'm annoying...
What were you gonna say there?

34:31.362 --> 34:32.568
What are the walls made of?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.948
What? Uh...

34:35.574 --> 34:37.075
I don't know, like, wood and brick or...

34:37.284 --> 34:38.660
No, no, no, the vault, the vault.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.530
The walls, what are they made out of?

34:40.746 --> 34:41.735
Where would it say that?

34:44.458 --> 34:45.447
Doesn't say anything.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.787
Where would it say the materials,
the type of stone?

34:48.128 --> 34:49.334
Oh, hang on.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.674
Yeah, here, hang on.
Here. It's gotta be in there.

35:02.726 --> 35:03.681
What?

35:03.894 --> 35:05.395
There's just something
I can't get out of my head.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.303
The moon's rising, Scott. What is it?

35:07.481 --> 35:09.563
- Risk and reward.
- Which means what?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.857
We're not measuring the risk
with enough information.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.105
- We don't know enough.
- We know time's running out.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.315
Yeah, but think about it.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.980
They put the triskele
on your door four months ago.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.532
What have they been doing all this time?
Why wait until now?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.996
We don't have the time
to figure out every little detail.

35:23.205 --> 35:24.786
But what if this detail,

35:25.082 --> 35:28.040
the reason why they waited,
what if it's the most important one?

35:28.252 --> 35:29.867
Then we do nothing.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.452
And Boyd and Erica are dead.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.457
I know what I'm risking.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.255
My life for theirs.

35:43.392 --> 35:45.053
And I won't blame you
if you don't follow me.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.773
There, that's it.

35:54.236 --> 35:55.351
Hecatolite.

35:55.613 --> 35:57.194
Is that awful? That sounds awful.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.064
Get them on the phone. Call them. Now!

36:00.242 --> 36:01.277
Okay, why?

36:01.744 --> 36:04.110
'Cause Boyd and that girl
aren't gonna kill each other.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.741
They're gonna kill Derek and Scott.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.072
Boyd?

36:56.507 --> 36:57.496
Boyd?

37:01.595 --> 37:02.801
It's me.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.008
It's Derek.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.885
Stiles, now is not the best time.

37:07.101 --> 37:08.386
Scott! Scott!
No, listen to me, okay?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.766
Look, you gotta get out of there.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.594
Look, the walls of the vault
are made with a mineral called hecatolite.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.931
- It scatters the moonlight.
- What does that mean?

37:15.526 --> 37:16.857
We're here to get you out, okay?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.397
Look,
it keeps the moonlight out, okay?

37:19.613 --> 37:21.114
They haven't felt the full moon in months.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.237
Think of it
like the gladiators in the Roman Colosseum.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.899
They used to starve the lions for three days,

37:25.119 --> 37:26.984
making them more vicious,
more out of control.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.120
Deucalion has kept them from shifting
for three full moons,

37:30.374 --> 37:32.581
diminishing their tolerance to it.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.036
Scott, they're gonna be stronger...

37:34.211 --> 37:37.578
More savage, more bloodthirsty.
Scott, they're the lions.

37:37.756 --> 37:41.465
They're the starved lions, and you and Derek
just stepped into the Colosseum.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.296
Derek, we got a problem,
a really big problem.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.763
Cora?

37:57.818 --> 37:58.853
Who?

37:59.528 --> 38:00.517
Cora?

38:02.698 --> 38:04.359
Derek, get out.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.649
Get out now!

38:06.869 --> 38:08.029
Scott?

38:08.996 --> 38:10.156
Hey, Scott!

38:22.259 --> 38:24.045
No. No! Wait!

38:28.348 --> 38:31.215
Scott? Scott, are you hearing this?

38:32.936 --> 38:34.142
Scott!

38:38.317 --> 38:40.353
Don't kid yourself, Marin.

38:41.528 --> 38:45.020
It's not the first time
you've gotten your hands dirty.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.840
You know her?

39:14.061 --> 39:15.722
She's my sister, my younger sister.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.515
What the hell is she doing here?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.429
Like I have a clue. I thought she was dead!

39:20.776 --> 39:21.765
Look out!

39:42.130 --> 39:43.256
No! Don't break the seal!

39:47.511 --> 39:48.591
Boyd!

39:57.646 --> 39:58.635
Don't touch her!

39:59.064 --> 40:01.305
- What were you thinking?
- That I had to do something.

40:01.483 --> 40:02.598
She saved our lives.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.312
Yeah, and what do you think
they're gonna do out there?

40:04.528 --> 40:06.143
Do you have any idea
what we just set free?

40:06.363 --> 40:07.978
You want to blame me?

40:08.156 --> 40:10.898
Well, I am not the one
turning teenagers into killers.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.117
No. No, that's just the rest of your family.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.658
I've made mistakes.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.041
Gerard is not my fault.

40:21.295 --> 40:23.001
And what about your mother?

40:24.256 --> 40:25.541
What do you mean?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.209
Tell her, Scott.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.053
What does he mean, Scott?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.474
What does he mean?
