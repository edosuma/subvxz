01:32.876 --> 01:36.796
ROSARITO, MEXICO

02:03.435 --> 02:06.435
Did you finish your homework yesterday, T?

02:12.436 --> 02:14.396
-Taylor? -What?

02:15.955 --> 02:18.956
"What?"

02:19.036 --> 02:21.956
I hope you do not talk
like that to the teachers.

02:22.036 --> 02:25.756
The answer you're looking for
is, "Excuse me, Dad."

02:25.835 --> 02:29.555
Maybe in England, but we're in Mexico.

02:29.636 --> 02:34.115
The country you live in does not
excuse bad behavior, smarting.

02:36.236 --> 02:39.596
-I'm talking with you.
-Whatever.

02:42.035 --> 02:46.036
"Thank you for making breakfast, Dad."

03:05.555 --> 03:08.876
Richard, I like what I hear,
but how does it help my company?

03:08.956 --> 03:12.875
I'm glad you asked that, Tom,
for the most important thing for us,

03:12.956 --> 03:16.076
absolute highest priority
is the business value.

03:16.155 --> 03:20.955
We have the resources to implement
a hybrid-based security solution

03:21.035 --> 03:27.035
which entails a sharp reduction in risk
for security breaches of cloud services.

03:27.075 --> 03:30.275
You know what, Tom?
I think we are the company for you.

03:30.435 --> 03:32.755
-So what do you say?
- We'll call you soon.

03:32.835 --> 03:35.715
- Brilliant, Tom.
Thanks. -Good bye.

03:46.515 --> 03:47.955
Hello?

03:48.035 --> 03:50.315
- Can I talk to Taylor's father?
-That's me.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.795
Unfortunately, Taylor was involved
in a situation at school today.

03:53.875 --> 03:57.715
-Oh well? What happened?
-He ended up in a fight with two boys.

03:57.795 --> 04:01.635
It seems that he
started the quarrel.

04:01.715 --> 04:05.555
- Do you know how it started?
-The boys refuse to answer that...

04:05.636 --> 04:08.715
... but the other students said
Taylor got angry because they teased.

04:08.835 --> 04:13.075
-But he knows better than that.
- Does he?

04:13.155 --> 04:16.235
You probably understand that we do
not tolerate such behavior at school.

04:16.315 --> 04:19.755
I'll talk to him
when he gets home.

04:19.834 --> 04:25.355
Can I get the phone numbers of the parents
of the children he was arguing with?

04:38.115 --> 04:41.955
I got a call from the principal today.
Is there anything you want to tell?

04:42.035 --> 04:46.555
Taylor!  This is the second time in two weeks!

04:46.635 --> 04:50.595
Do not walk away from me.  Turn around.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.356
Who was it?  Same as last time?

04:59.955 --> 05:01.635
Yes.

05:07.595 --> 05:11.836
It's a real bruise.
Who struck the first blow?

05:11.915 --> 05:15.795
Principal says you did.
Is it true?

05:17.715 --> 05:19.395
Taylor?

05:22.195 --> 05:25.196
-I thought we agreed.
-No, you agreed.

05:25.276 --> 05:30.515
They say things about me and mom.
They call me an orphan.

05:30.595 --> 05:33.795
So what? Let them say it.
It's not worth fighting for.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.275
Stop trying to walk away! I have
said that violence is not the answer.

05:38.355 --> 05:41.595
-It got quiet on them!
- It does not matter, okay?

05:41.675 --> 05:46.475
You can not fix all problems.
It punishes itself in the long run.

05:49.436 --> 05:54.874
I'm trying to raise you
as your mother wanted...

05:54.915 --> 05:59.996
-Mom is dead, so stop trying.
- Do not be like that.

06:00.075 --> 06:06.035
Instead of teaching me to flee,
you can teach me to stand up for myself.

06:06.755 --> 06:09.195
There are better ways to handle things.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.715
Taylor!

06:19.435 --> 06:23.955
HOW TO BEAT HARD AND
FAST IN A STREET FIGHT

06:24.035 --> 06:29.155
As you can see, I lured him into false
security and took a strong position myself.

06:29.235 --> 06:34.475
I saw the purpose and struck with all my might.
Then I can put myself in the same position.

06:34.556 --> 06:41.195
I kick in the writing first,
before hitting him with my elbow.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.755
Or I can start by focusing
highly on the body.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.835
And ends with a kick to the head.

06:50.915 --> 06:53.434
I do not want to argue.

06:58.515 --> 07:00.154
Taylor?

07:03.116 --> 07:05.355
-What are you doing? -Homework.

07:05.475 --> 07:09.075
Homework? With that noise?
I heard you from downstairs.

07:10.035 --> 07:12.995
I watched YouTube.

07:13.155 --> 07:16.235
Were the homework on YouTube?

07:20.715 --> 07:24.675
"How to hit hard and
fast in a street fight."

07:26.115 --> 07:28.755
Charming...
Why are you looking at this?

07:28.834 --> 07:32.156
Next time they make noise,
I'll knock them down.

07:32.235 --> 07:35.674
Taylor, now you're listening to me.
I will not have to hear

07:35.715 --> 07:39.075
that you have beaten other children at school.

07:39.115 --> 07:43.075
I do not care what they say.
It's not worth it.

07:45.195 --> 07:47.715
Continue with your
proper homework.

07:47.755 --> 07:52.115
Your teacher did not ask you
to teach him to beat anyone.

07:52.196 --> 07:55.875
-I'm almost done.
-Almost not done, right?

07:57.315 --> 07:59.635
I keep this one.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.875
-Hello? -Richard.

09:48.275 --> 09:53.515
-Who is it?
-The question, amigo, is who you are.

09:53.595 --> 09:55.995
What are you talking about?

09:56.075 --> 10:01.234
You are a security consultant living
in Mexico with his son. A quiet life.

10:02.115 --> 10:05.995
Or, that's what you've been
saying to others in recent years.

10:06.075 --> 10:08.675
Right, Nero?

10:09.314 --> 10:12.994
-How do you know that name?
-I know the truth about you.

10:13.075 --> 10:16.235
I know where you have been,
what you have done and who you really are.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.515
I do not know what kind of game this
is, but I do not intend to participate.

10:19.594 --> 10:24.915
The game has just begun.
You'll get a video in 30 seconds.

10:24.995 --> 10:26.636
Taylor?

10:29.074 --> 10:30.755
Taylor!

10:32.955 --> 10:35.114
Taylor!

10:38.074 --> 10:40.954
Where is my son?

10:40.994 --> 10:44.155
Look at your screen, amigo.

11:01.114 --> 11:05.235
-Who the hell are you? -The one
who decides. You know the rules.

11:05.315 --> 11:08.515
I do not have to explain
the situation to you?

11:08.595 --> 11:13.594
Listen carefully. If you so much as touch
a hair on his head, then I promise...

11:13.634 --> 11:17.155
You're killing us all. And you know
what, Nero? That's why I chose you.

11:17.235 --> 11:21.075
I do not doubt that,
but I need you for a job.

11:21.515 --> 11:25.515
What the hell job? What are you
talking about? Where is my son?

11:25.635 --> 11:29.595
You are wasting the short time
your son has left of life.

11:29.674 --> 11:34.035
-Are you ready to listen?
-I hear.

11:34.115 --> 11:39.475
Your son is trapped in a gas chamber. Follow
my instructions throughout the day...

11:40.195 --> 11:42.715
... otherwise he dies of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

11:42.795 --> 11:48.395
You will do everything I ask, which
includes murder, which you are good at.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.034
And when it's all over,
your son will be released.

11:52.115 --> 11:57.555
Are you still there? There's a
package in the garage. AndalÃ©! Fast!

12:13.154 --> 12:16.315
Do you see the west?  Put it on.

12:27.154 --> 12:30.394
There is a small camera on the west.
Turn it on.

12:31.195 --> 12:35.515
All you can see, I see too, amigo.
Do not invent anything.

12:36.194 --> 12:39.754
In the box there is a silver box.  Open it.

12:54.355 --> 12:57.435
This is your bulletproof SUV.

13:11.515 --> 13:13.474
These are your coordinates.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.595
Follow the road to the goal.

13:25.515 --> 13:29.155
I'm not going anywhere
until I can talk to my son.

13:34.075 --> 13:38.235
Taylor? Taylor, it's Dad.
Can you hear me?

13:38.314 --> 13:41.474
-Taylor? -Dad? Dad!

13:41.515 --> 13:43.435
It's going well, boy.

13:44.914 --> 13:49.154
What happened to your face?
Did they hurt you?

13:49.235 --> 13:51.115
No, I'm fine.

13:52.754 --> 13:58.354
Where are you? Do you see or hear
something that reveals where you are?

13:58.435 --> 14:00.955
I do not know where I am.
When I woke up, I was here.

14:01.795 --> 14:05.635
-What's going on, Dad?
-I do not know.

14:05.715 --> 14:07.954
Taylor?  Taylor!

14:08.035 --> 14:10.555
Fuck!  Hell!

14:10.635 --> 14:14.954
He has no idea how he ended up
there, but the boy fought well.

14:15.034 --> 14:17.755
He's tough, just like his padre.

14:17.834 --> 14:22.714
The rules are simple: Do as I say.
Carbon monoxide is terrible.

14:22.754 --> 14:25.995
At the end of the day,
if you've done everything I ask,

14:26.115 --> 14:29.114
handed over to your
son in a safe place.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.874
-How do I know you'll let him go?
-It's called trust.

14:33.955 --> 14:39.955
-We will work on it throughout the day. -Trust?
Then it's going to be a damn long day.

14:40.594 --> 14:43.075
When can I talk to my son again?

14:43.155 --> 14:47.275
When you have completed the first mission.
Not a second earlier.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.275
I'm here.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.555
- Do you see the hotel on the left?
-Yes.

15:27.595 --> 15:33.835
There is a meeting in the restaurant
between the Roja and Garza cartels.

15:33.915 --> 15:36.955
They are trying to bury the
hatchet and come to an agreement.

15:37.035 --> 15:42.194
That would be bad, because then they
control everything west of the T.J. River.

15:43.075 --> 15:44.395
Terrible people.

15:45.034 --> 15:47.035
So what do you want with me?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.795
I want you to go in there...

15:50.595 --> 15:52.555
... and kills everyone.

15:52.634 --> 15:55.275
My God, you're not serious.

15:55.395 --> 16:00.874
Have I done anything to make you believe
that I do not mean bloody seriousness?

16:00.955 --> 16:04.434
It's madness.
I can 't shoot the place to shreds.

16:04.514 --> 16:09.314
-Think of all the innocents nearby.
-Your son's life depends on it.

16:09.395 --> 16:14.114
In this case, I'm playing
god, and I can tell you this.

16:14.195 --> 16:17.635
There are no innocents in there.
No saints, only sinners.

16:17.714 --> 16:20.635
Villains.  Bandits.

16:21.595 --> 16:27.194
-How many villains are we talking about?
-10-12 pieces, approx.

16:27.274 --> 16:31.515
There was no problem
for Nero 15 years ago,

16:31.594 --> 16:35.954
but the question is whether you
still have what is required.

16:36.034 --> 16:38.954
You have a dark side, buddy.

16:39.034 --> 16:43.514
So you say that if I go in
there and kill everyone I see,

16:43.594 --> 16:47.394
and somehow survive,
so can I talk to my son?

16:48.314 --> 16:51.074
Of course, seÃ±or.  Just like that.

16:51.114 --> 16:54.555
And it's your only chance
to see your son alive again.

16:54.634 --> 17:00.034
So go in there and play Call
of Duty against those bastards.

17:02.874 --> 17:05.554
No no no.  No zipper.

17:07.915 --> 17:09.794
I want to see the show.

17:12.273 --> 17:16.473
The taste is like the butt.
I'll be right back.

20:22.634 --> 20:26.514
Bravo, Nero.  Well done, my friend.

20:26.594 --> 20:30.514
-Yes, pickpocket. Give me my son.
-Shouldn't you fit your mouth?

20:30.595 --> 20:37.113
Listen. I just massacred a
gang of armed Mexican bandits.

20:37.154 --> 20:40.994
So cut out the pissing
and let me talk to my son!

20:41.035 --> 20:43.833
You know what?
I'll let you get away with it this time

20:43.874 --> 20:46.994
because I understand you're
excited since I have your kid,

20:47.074 --> 20:51.715
but you did damn well.
Do not be afraid, I keep my promise.

20:51.794 --> 20:55.234
- He's coming in a minute.
-It is best.

20:55.314 --> 20:59.434
And one more thing...
If one of your men touches the boy again

20:59.515 --> 21:02.914
then the killings will happen
much closer to you, you see?

21:02.994 --> 21:07.514
Why do you say that?
We start to become friends, create trust.

21:07.594 --> 21:13.994
And after what you did at the restaurant,
I think you're the right man for the job.

21:14.715 --> 21:18.914
Behold, your son is well.
Tough is here. Say hello to Dad.

21:21.074 --> 21:26.073
-Taylor, are you okay?
It's Dad. -I'm freezing.

21:26.114 --> 21:29.794
I know, my boy,
but you have to stay calm, okay?

21:29.874 --> 21:32.995
-I promise I'm coming.
- Do you send help?

21:33.074 --> 21:36.674
-No, I do this myself.
-What? How?

21:36.754 --> 21:40.994
You just have to trust me, okay?
Trust me.

21:41.074 --> 21:45.475
The men who took you force
me to do something for them,

21:45.554 --> 21:49.874
but as soon as it's over, I'll pick you up.
You have to persevere.

21:49.954 --> 21:53.155
Who are they and why do they do this?

21:55.154 --> 21:56.914
Fuck!  Turn on again!

21:56.995 --> 22:01.234
Nero, now there's plenty
of father and son talk.

22:01.314 --> 22:06.475
Do not worry. I'll give your boy
a good peanut butter sandwich

22:06.555 --> 22:10.754
and a glass of warm milk as
you prepare for your next job.

22:10.834 --> 22:15.914
Yes do it. Do not forget to cut off
the edge of the bread, you bastard.

22:15.993 --> 22:19.713
Nero, you have to learn to disagree
without being so unpleasant.

22:19.794 --> 22:22.834
Otherwise the kid will
get your bad habits, ok?

22:22.915 --> 22:27.554
I liked how you beat yourself up.
See if you can do more of it.

22:27.634 --> 22:32.474
Did you like it?
Luckily something turns you on.

22:32.554 --> 22:36.033
Okay, go to the next job, my friend.

22:36.475 --> 22:39.314
These are your new coordinates.

22:44.673 --> 22:47.514
You were right.  He's a killing machine.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.554
He just needed a little motivation.

22:51.634 --> 22:54.794
I should have been a fucking life coach.

22:54.914 --> 22:57.034
Listen to me, muchachos.

22:57.114 --> 23:00.554
Usually we clean after all the gringos.

23:00.674 --> 23:04.154
While sitting at home watching TV.

23:04.234 --> 23:09.955
But tonight we watch TV while
the gringos clean up after us.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.553
-Are you ready? -Yes!

23:14.594 --> 23:16.353
-Are you ready? -Yes!

23:16.434 --> 23:18.914
Get ready, bastards!

23:29.754 --> 23:31.474
Continue in the direction of travel.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.034
Okay, Nero.  See what you can do.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.875
That bastard is torn to
pieces within three minutes.

23:38.954 --> 23:42.393
-Whose side are you on?
-Your, boss.

23:42.434 --> 23:46.394
Okay, then we'll find out what our
gringo thinks about the nightlife.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.594
Be vigilant.  Eyes everywhere.

23:58.674 --> 24:00.354
Perceived.

24:18.274 --> 24:22.434
Nero, do you see the big
building to your left?

24:22.514 --> 24:25.434
Yes, I see it.

24:25.514 --> 24:28.514
The host of the next
party is Eliazar Machado.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.794
He's a bad bastard.

24:32.274 --> 24:35.874
He's hosting the next
party you're going to.

24:35.954 --> 24:40.075
Trust me, Nero,
when I say he's a bad bastard.

24:40.154 --> 24:45.714
-I know who Machado is.
-Good, then you know he deserves it.

24:45.794 --> 24:49.795
Yes... Prostitution,
extortion, kidnapping.

24:49.874 --> 24:55.113
And the bombing of JuÃ¡rez,
when I think about it.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.273
He's almost as big a meat as you.

24:58.315 --> 25:02.594
TouchÃ©, but unlike me, Nero...

25:02.674 --> 25:07.394
... then the world would be better
off without him. Here's how we do it:

25:07.474 --> 25:11.234
Our goal is to have a little party
in there. Go up to the third floor.

25:11.994 --> 25:14.914
To the VIP room, where he has fun.

25:15.074 --> 25:16.634
There you kill him.

25:20.034 --> 25:23.794
Good luck. I hope you're not
too rusty after 15 years, Dad.

25:23.874 --> 25:27.314
Because your little
boy is counting on you.

25:29.953 --> 25:34.834
The only rusty thing is the nails in your
coffin if something happens to my son.

25:48.434 --> 25:50.275
Buddy.

25:50.874 --> 25:53.634
Stay there.  Up with your hands.

26:00.354 --> 26:02.874
What do you have there?

28:01.353 --> 28:03.234
Damn, I did not expect that!

28:12.914 --> 28:17.274
Black!  Black!  Black!

28:29.834 --> 28:34.874
- There we have your guy, Donovan.
-I said he was the best.

30:31.953 --> 30:33.674
-Out! Out! -Hell!

30:34.474 --> 30:36.474
-Machado? -Who the hell are you?

30:40.593 --> 30:43.633
- Do you see this?
-SÃ­, perfecto, seÃ±or.

30:43.713 --> 30:47.433
Shoot that bastard in the head.  Metal!

30:47.514 --> 30:51.153
-Who the hell is that?
-I do not know. Say it you.

30:51.234 --> 30:55.474
-How the hell am I supposed to know?
-Nero, carbon monoxide...

30:55.554 --> 30:58.474
Do you recognize his voice?

30:58.554 --> 31:01.314
Whoever you are, you're a fucking coward!

31:01.394 --> 31:03.913
Did you not manage to kill myself?

31:03.993 --> 31:07.394
I do not want to get dirty when
I throw the garbage, amigo.

31:07.473 --> 31:09.633
-Fuck you! -Matal!

31:27.073 --> 31:29.713
BravÃ­simo Brilliantly
done, my friend.

31:35.633 --> 31:39.714
- We have one minute until
the cop is there. -Kjekken.

31:40.233 --> 31:44.554
-Stop staring in the mirror.
-He has to get out of there.

31:45.313 --> 31:48.033
What are you doing?  Run!

31:50.634 --> 31:55.034
Run! Federales are coming.
Vamonos, Dad.

32:07.874 --> 32:10.354
Sends new coordinates.

32:32.913 --> 32:35.394
- Did he make it?
-It looks like that.

32:36.234 --> 32:38.913
These are your coordinates.

32:40.314 --> 32:42.513
I want to talk to my son.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.993
You know what, amigo?
You deserve it.

32:54.153 --> 32:57.954
-Taylor? -Dad, are you okay?

32:58.753 --> 33:01.914
Yes, I'm fine, buddy.
How are you?

33:01.993 --> 33:04.274
Who are they?  Why do they do this?

33:04.353 --> 33:10.393
They want me to clean up their mess.
It's my fault you were abducted.

33:10.473 --> 33:12.993
What do you mean?

33:13.153 --> 33:17.193
-I worked for an intelligence service.
-As a spy?

33:17.953 --> 33:20.953
Yes, approximately.  More like a soldier.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.913
The special forces.
Like in one of your video games.

33:24.993 --> 33:27.073
Does it have anything
to do with mom's death?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.873
Unfortunately, it has.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.834
Dad.  Tell me what happened.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.473
Please, Dad.

33:39.353 --> 33:43.393
Come on, Nero. If anyone deserves
to know the truth, it's your son.

33:43.434 --> 33:45.954
-Shut up! -Who is it?

33:46.033 --> 33:49.713
It's me, Taylor.
The man who kidnapped you.

33:50.754 --> 33:55.713
-Why did he call you Nero?
-It's a name from the past.

33:55.793 --> 33:59.073
It's best you take it back.

33:59.233 --> 34:02.193
The boys' lives depend on it, Dad.

34:02.274 --> 34:06.393
Tell the truth.
The truth will set you free.

34:06.433 --> 34:10.313
Dad, tell me what happened.
I want to know.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.033
Okay, I'm going to say that.

34:15.114 --> 34:20.873
Someone betrayed me. Someone told
who I was to some awful people.

34:21.873 --> 34:26.112
They found out where we lived.
They took your mother.

34:27.473 --> 34:31.033
I did everything I
could to get her back.

34:31.953 --> 34:34.592
When I finally found her...

34:36.033 --> 34:38.112
... it was too late.

34:38.193 --> 34:41.592
- Did they kill her?
-Yes, they killed her.

34:42.594 --> 34:46.273
-What did you do then?
-I did what was necessary.

34:48.033 --> 34:52.513
I tracked them down, and when I found
them, I killed every single one.

34:56.833 --> 35:02.713
So they took me out of service,
moved us to Mexico and we were safe...

35:04.033 --> 35:06.873
-...until now.
-What do they want?

35:06.913 --> 35:10.353
They want me to do the same to
their enemies as I did to mine.

35:10.434 --> 35:14.113
I thought I had put that life behind
me, but now it's back.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.594
So I'm going to do
as the asshole asks,

35:17.673 --> 35:22.633
but when it's over I'll pick you
up, believe me.

35:23.593 --> 35:26.953
Dad, sorry I'm behaved badly.

35:29.154 --> 35:31.553
You have nothing to apologize for.

35:32.874 --> 35:37.273
-Everything is going to be OK.
I come. -I love you dad.

35:43.113 --> 35:46.394
Sorry to have to interrupt therapy, Dad.

35:46.473 --> 35:51.553
But you have a lot to do,
and a long drive. Time to go.

35:59.073 --> 36:03.193
Listen to me, muchachos.
The main number starts in a few hours.

36:03.273 --> 36:08.353
Go and smoke. Have a drink.
My house is your house.

36:09.313 --> 36:12.193
Right, Donovan?

36:25.754 --> 36:28.554
Show respect in my case.

36:28.634 --> 36:31.353
-Si, sir! -Si, sir!

37:28.713 --> 37:32.433
Take it...
Take this to keep warm.

37:36.553 --> 37:39.633
I brought peanut butter...

37:40.393 --> 37:44.113
PG&J, as they say.  Without edges.

37:44.193 --> 37:46.913
Like your dad said you like it.

38:08.514 --> 38:11.793
Sorry we had to disturb
your life like that.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.153
We had to make sure your father
cooperated, and that was the only way.

38:16.113 --> 38:18.234
I know you're scared.

38:19.513 --> 38:21.954
But everything will go well.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.754
My father is going to kill you.

38:32.833 --> 38:35.753
I hope it is not necessary.

38:36.713 --> 38:39.114
When it's all over, you go home.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.994
Maybe, but I've read enough to know

38:42.074 --> 38:45.593
that if I see the kidnapper's
face, then I do not survive.

38:50.713 --> 38:55.073
- You're going to kill me.
-You're a smart guy.

38:56.473 --> 38:58.953
And brave too.

39:04.194 --> 39:07.633
But not everything ends as it does in the books.

39:08.672 --> 39:12.193
You may realize that later in life.

39:13.273 --> 39:15.473
Later in life?

39:27.553 --> 39:30.153
You just have to trust me.

40:15.872 --> 40:20.433
Donovan, are you not happy?
What is it?

40:20.513 --> 40:26.713
-It works better than I thought.
-Perfecto. And the irony is not lost.

40:27.193 --> 40:33.393
You gringos do not send your best.
You send the murderers, the rapists.

40:33.474 --> 40:38.473
We had a killer among us,
and I just had to activate him.

40:38.593 --> 40:42.114
It's your specialty Take the
kid, then turn the switch on.

40:42.193 --> 40:48.673
He strikes out the resistance, you control
the goods to the north with clean hands.

40:48.714 --> 40:55.953
And with total power, there is less
blood, and the quality of life is rising.

40:56.033 --> 40:58.753
Everyone benefits from it,
and it's good for business.

40:58.793 --> 41:01.633
As I said: Brilliant.

41:01.713 --> 41:07.832
Now everyone who is interested in this
part of the world must go through me.

41:07.873 --> 41:12.673
Life gets easier.
The cartels do not kill each other.

41:13.993 --> 41:16.794
But you're still worried.  Why?

41:17.793 --> 41:20.394
If Nero survives,
he's killing us all.

41:21.594 --> 41:24.872
We have his son.
That's all he cares about.

41:24.953 --> 41:28.353
Just.  That worries me.

41:28.513 --> 41:33.792
Donovan, why are you coming
up with this bad energy?

41:33.834 --> 41:37.592
It's your plan and everything
goes according to plan.

41:37.632 --> 41:41.953
We do not even know if he will
succeed in the next mission.

41:42.033 --> 41:46.473
Hopefully he does great
damage before it's all over.

41:46.553 --> 41:51.633
You can hope for that.
If he survives, he will come after us.

41:51.713 --> 41:54.673
He did it for us many times.

41:54.752 --> 41:58.633
You fear an unnatural death.

41:58.712 --> 42:01.753
Are you afraid that Nero will kill you?

42:01.833 --> 42:05.753
Yes, I am. And so should you.

42:16.113 --> 42:21.632
-I do not trust him.
-You should not trust him, dear.

42:25.674 --> 42:29.472
Calling him a pendejo is
an insult to all pendejos.

42:32.113 --> 42:34.232
Soon the war is over.

42:34.272 --> 42:39.114
We use the resources at schools
and universities, just as we said.

42:39.193 --> 42:41.313
Just like my father did.

42:41.473 --> 42:44.233
Your father lived in a simpler time.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.833
And we have no excuse.

42:48.433 --> 42:54.113
If anyone can take care
of these gringos, it's me.

42:54.193 --> 42:59.192
You know I would never
surrender our people?

42:59.232 --> 43:02.233
Yes I know.

44:04.993 --> 44:08.394
A toast... for a new day.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.072
A new beginning.

44:11.153 --> 44:16.313
And we will see the complete
destruction of our enemies.

44:18.033 --> 44:20.513
-Hello! -Hello!

44:34.073 --> 44:37.393
Black!  Listen, amigo.

44:37.992 --> 44:40.513
The next target is Omar Chavez.

44:40.553 --> 44:45.313
They say he has a leading role
in the cartels, just behind me.

44:45.353 --> 44:49.193
It's insulting. He's a bad guy.

44:49.273 --> 44:52.793
They are involved in human trafficking.
We're not doing that shit.

44:52.873 --> 44:57.152
No, we have honor and
international arms agreements.

44:57.233 --> 45:00.234
You must understand, we are a cartel.

45:00.313 --> 45:04.513
We know that if you trust violence,
you will get a violent end.

45:04.553 --> 45:08.473
But these kill innocent people for no reason.

45:08.552 --> 45:12.512
So do not worry about your
karma, ok, amigo?

45:12.593 --> 45:16.993
This is the truth.  The truth, Nero...

45:17.553 --> 45:19.873
This will not be easy.

45:20.713 --> 45:24.192
Time to bring out the heavy artillery.
Everything you have.

45:24.273 --> 45:27.193
But I trust you,
and so does your son.

45:27.273 --> 45:30.433
We trust that you will take care of
the situation, and then I mean...

45:30.473 --> 45:34.752
Let me guess: Everyone has to die?

45:36.033 --> 45:39.713
- Did you hear? Exactly, sir.
-What a surprise.

45:40.193 --> 45:43.352
We are like brothers.  We think alike.

45:43.392 --> 45:47.192
Nero, you were right.  And listen to this.

45:47.232 --> 45:51.153
Black!  Black!  Black!

45:56.393 --> 46:03.233
Nero, you have the support
of me and my men. Vamonos.

46:11.313 --> 46:13.112
Hey, Callenle.

46:15.713 --> 46:18.672
Are you ready to win?

46:18.752 --> 46:21.512
Yas, get him in the carriage.

46:28.793 --> 46:32.593
They attacked the club.  Machados club.

46:34.313 --> 46:38.873
They also killed the gang members
from Roja and Garza at Garza's hotel.

46:40.153 --> 46:44.193
How could that happen?
Do they know who is behind it?

46:44.353 --> 46:46.273
They said it was a one-man job.

46:46.352 --> 46:52.553
Please, should a man take out an entire
group? Three groups? For God's sake.

46:53.312 --> 46:55.073
That's what they say.

46:57.793 --> 46:59.713
- Machado died? -Yes.

47:03.113 --> 47:05.952
We have to warn the boys.
We can be the next.

47:08.832 --> 47:12.032
Do you think it could be Mzamo Lascano?

47:12.193 --> 47:15.512
No, there's no one from the street.

47:15.552 --> 47:20.033
It's the CIA. MI6.
An intelligence service.

48:43.033 --> 48:46.752
Muchachos,
the last battle is approaching.

48:47.273 --> 48:50.432
There's not a damn chance
he's surviving this.

49:10.793 --> 49:15.233
-Buenos dias. -Buenos dias.
Thank you.

50:16.872 --> 50:19.392
Cartridge!  They have broken into the area!

50:19.433 --> 50:21.432
-Whose? -We do not know.

50:53.713 --> 50:57.992
Pray for us sinners,

50:58.072 --> 51:02.832
now and at the moment of death.  Amen.

51:54.953 --> 51:56.472
What a sick bastard!

52:21.312 --> 52:25.193
-Fucking shit. -I told you so.

52:44.192 --> 52:48.432
-Diablo...
-It seems he's not doing well.

52:48.512 --> 52:51.072
You have nothing to fear, Donovan.

52:52.673 --> 52:56.432
Omar, we almost took you, pendejo.

52:57.312 --> 53:01.632
Now we have to clean up the mess.

53:01.673 --> 53:06.752
The British fought well.
It was sad to see him die.

53:07.592 --> 53:13.392
When you try to kill a lion
fighting to protect its herd,

53:13.472 --> 53:18.953
his familia, the future,
then the lion will fight to the death.

53:19.992 --> 53:24.112
The gringo was our lion.  He fought.

53:24.192 --> 53:27.552
He deserves our respect.

53:36.833 --> 53:39.192
Interesting night.

53:40.633 --> 53:43.192
Oman will understand that
I was behind the attack.

53:43.272 --> 53:46.313
He's coming for me, but I'm ready.

53:47.273 --> 53:49.952
I send the men to
clean up the mess.

53:51.632 --> 53:55.033
-In that case.
- We'll take the fight to him.

54:21.312 --> 54:25.152
Muchachos, fix this now.

54:25.192 --> 54:30.032
Tomorrow we will take care of everything on both
sides of the border for an entire generation.

54:30.112 --> 54:32.152
Vamonos!

55:32.552 --> 55:34.512
Who are you?

55:35.592 --> 55:37.512
Do I know you?

55:40.392 --> 55:42.952
Why am I your enemy?

55:44.112 --> 55:46.433
Or why was Machado?

55:55.792 --> 55:59.272
We searched your phone
and found this video.

56:05.952 --> 56:08.513
Is that your son?

56:09.912 --> 56:12.512
They're going to kill him.

56:14.592 --> 56:16.752
Whose?

56:16.831 --> 56:19.073
Say it, you.

56:20.592 --> 56:22.591
Why should I know that?

56:25.591 --> 56:28.032
So they forced you to do this?

56:30.312 --> 56:36.192
Whoever they are, they will see
you and other cartel leaders dead.

56:38.312 --> 56:42.312
-And you've never seen him?
-No, I've just heard his voice...

56:42.432 --> 56:45.113
... from the other end of the phone.

56:46.272 --> 56:49.312
He's just talking about trust, okay?

56:49.392 --> 56:54.072
Other than that, I have no idea.

56:54.152 --> 56:57.552
- Did you say "trust"?
-Yes, trust.

56:57.632 --> 57:00.672
He talked a lot about trust?

57:03.592 --> 57:05.952
Mzamo Lascano...

57:07.592 --> 57:10.152
- Are you talking about the cartel leader?
-Do you know him?

57:10.272 --> 57:12.472
I've heard of him.

57:12.552 --> 57:17.552
Mzamo is the only one who has
balls to try something like this.

57:19.192 --> 57:23.232
He has been trying to gather
power for several years.

57:23.273 --> 57:26.232
They took my son.  Where is he?

57:26.312 --> 57:30.953
If he's in Mexico,
then he's in his beach villa.

57:32.352 --> 57:35.671
South of Playa La Mision.

57:35.712 --> 57:39.792
Are you from the CIA?  MI6?

57:42.632 --> 57:46.992
-It does not matter now.
- I'm sorry you got involved.

57:47.071 --> 57:49.632
And what happened to your son.

57:49.672 --> 57:52.951
But you came to my house
with bad intentions.

57:53.552 --> 57:56.232
That's why it ends like this for you.

01:01:21.592 --> 01:01:24.432
May your enemies respect you.

01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:28.192
May the Lord protect you.

01:01:29.272 --> 01:01:31.952
And may death forget you.

01:01:42.352 --> 01:01:44.911
Maybe we should wait.

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:50.592
To your men report that
Chavez is neutralized.

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:53.072
I do not know if we should celebrate.

01:02:00.032 --> 01:02:02.232
What is the next step?

01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:06.672
Gather a meeting with all survivors.
They must go with us.

01:02:07.472 --> 01:02:13.512
I always intend to expand. The problem
is that they have limited vision.

01:02:13.632 --> 01:02:20.112
We will focus on technological development.
Pure fuel, universities and politics.

01:02:21.072 --> 01:02:25.152
Make the cartels big again,
and they'll pay for it.

01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:30.792
Donovan, in this brave new world,
you have a seat at the table.

01:02:31.632 --> 01:02:36.191
I'll need your government
contacts, your advice.

01:02:36.232 --> 01:02:39.552
I need to know who is
going against me and why.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:43.272
I need to know which politicians
are willing to cooperate.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:46.072
I do what I can, as always.

01:02:46.152 --> 01:02:50.512
Yes, I'll make you a wealthy
man, amigo.

01:02:51.592 --> 01:02:54.191
You've already done that.

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:59.152
So what do we do with the loose thread?

01:03:00.112 --> 01:03:04.312
Do you understand that we have
to deal with the situation?

01:03:06.552 --> 01:03:08.632
Which loose thread?

01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.872
You know what I mean.

01:03:14.351 --> 01:03:18.912
- Are we killing children now?
-We do what is required.

01:03:20.392 --> 01:03:22.752
Give me the keys.

01:03:38.351 --> 01:03:40.792
You know...

01:03:40.872 --> 01:03:46.752
If you want to be a jef here, then you need
to be able to make difficult decisions.

01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:50.472
Donovan, save me the speech.
I'm good at what I do.

01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:52.951
I've never claimed
to be a saint.

01:03:52.991 --> 01:03:56.752
But if you intend to kill
children, do not do it near us.

01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:00.952
It is your choice.

01:04:01.951 --> 01:04:04.231
As you wish.

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:58.470
Open it.

01:07:14.712 --> 01:07:17.551
It must be Nero.  Come with me!

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:54.991
The boy is gone.  It was Nero.

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:58.071
It was not Nero, Donovan.
It was me.

01:09:09.072 --> 01:09:12.310
A man's actions say a lot.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.071
Yours was disappointing.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.390
No child is killed
as long as I decide.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:21.071
I moved the boy to a safe
place, protected from you.

01:09:21.151 --> 01:09:24.991
-Nero is dead.
-I had not invested money in it.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.072
Hey, Nero.

01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:35.111
Donovan?

01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:38.270
You do not intend to claim
that this was for the queen?

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.031
Not completely.

01:09:44.392 --> 01:09:47.191
I have always suspected...

01:09:48.031 --> 01:09:52.272
... that it was you who
betrayed me and killed my wife.

01:09:55.231 --> 01:09:58.032
But I never dared to believe it.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:00.391
It's a tough industry.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.511
And dangerous.

01:10:06.552 --> 01:10:07.991
We do what we...

01:11:05.071 --> 01:11:06.671
Fuck!

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.951
Good.

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:08.951
-Mzamo. -Nero. Finally.

01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:11.511
Will you tell me what the hell is going on?

01:13:11.591 --> 01:13:15.791
How about "Thank you,
Mzamo, for saving my life."?

01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:20.671
-Where is my son, cocky?
-You want to meet your son? I understand.

01:13:21.391 --> 01:13:23.951
Do you want him to see this?

01:13:24.711 --> 01:13:28.911
Alanza, get his boy and
meet us at the house.

01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:35.670
If you try something, it's dead.

01:13:44.351 --> 01:13:46.312
Get up to speed.

01:14:01.431 --> 01:14:03.712
-Dad! -Taylor!

01:14:07.631 --> 01:14:10.230
-Is it going well? -I'm fine.

01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:19.231
-I can kill you both here and now.
-Yes you can.

01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:24.431
But what had happened?
Tomorrow someone else had taken my place.

01:14:25.191 --> 01:14:29.711
But when they find you...
And believe me, they find you.

01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:33.911
... then you and your son will
be in exactly the same situation.

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:38.871
I'm not claiming to be a good
man, but I keep my word.

01:14:40.192 --> 01:14:42.952
I gave you your son back.

01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:45.151
This is what we should do.

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:51.911
You travel home to your beach
house, and we will leave you alone.

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:56.271
We control North Baja and will
try to do something about it.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.791
You have to dream.

01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:04.151
I was not disguised.
They have seen my face and know who I am.

01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:10.271
The cartels will reach out to all of
us, including me and my son.

01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:15.631
As of today,
I control everything.

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:20.551
There are no more cartels.
I'm the last leader.

01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:23.871
The offer only comes once in a lifetime.

01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:28.271
I'm the only one who can guarantee
that you and your son are safe.

01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:33.031
You can not guarantee anything.
You barely have control for a day.

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:38.351
I may have underestimated you, Nero,
but now you're underestimating me.

01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:43.591
I'm one who survives and wants to be
here, just like me padre.

01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:49.751
I gave you my word that I
would give you your son.

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:54.750
I kept my promise,
and now I promise you again.

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:59.951
You'll never see us again.

01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:08.350
Sometimes the devil you know is
better than the devil you do not know.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.311
Oh well.

01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:19.671
But if I ever see you again...

01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:22.951
I know.  You're killing us all.

01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:37.710
Come here, boy.  Is it going well?

01:16:38.391 --> 01:16:41.871
Why did you not kill him?
Do you trust him?

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.830
No, I do not trust him.
Of course not.

01:16:44.872 --> 01:16:49.630
But as I said earlier: Violence
does not solve everything.

01:16:49.711 --> 01:16:54.390
Sometimes, yes, but other times
it is better to use the head.

01:16:55.871 --> 01:17:00.351
That bastard knows I can
kill him whenever I want.

01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:05.511
And that kind of devil I like.
Do you understand?

01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:08.631
Yes?  Come here.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:11.752
Now we'm leaving.

01:17:15.751 --> 01:17:18.310
Now we put you in the car.

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:22.270
-What about the motorcycle?
- Do you mean the Harley?

01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:25.311
Yes.  Can you drive a motorcycle?

01:17:26.231 --> 01:17:32.471
Yes. Yes.
But maybe I'm a little rusty.

01:17:33.991 --> 01:17:39.311
Dad, can you teach me to fight now?

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:43.911
I do not know.  According to your principal...

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:48.911
... you've beaten people down all semester.
