WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:16.683
Well, it's breakfast on a Monday,
which means The Bachelor is on tonight.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.644
It's been another dramatic week,
and the big question is:

00:19.728 --> 00:23.148
Will the fact that Chelsea reads her book
while everyone has fun watching

00:23.231 --> 00:25.817
ultimately affect Claire's decision?

00:25.900 --> 00:27.444
Let's find out now...

00:28.194 --> 00:29.863
at the smoothie ceremony.

00:30.655 --> 00:34.159
-I'm not doing this again.
-Do you want the smoothie or not?

00:34.242 --> 00:35.952
You know that I want it!

00:50.383 --> 00:51.384
Solana.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.597
Will you accept this smoothie?

00:56.806 --> 00:57.891
Of course.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.863
-Grant.
-Yes.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.200
I'm so sorry.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.161
Will you accept this smoothie?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.372
Always.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.628
Roomies, this is the final smoothie.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.006
When you're ready.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.264
Chelsea.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.479
It has been a--

01:44.562 --> 01:47.899
Give me the damn smoothie.
God, I hate Bachelor nights!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.579
Good morning.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.541
Have a good workout.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.627
You go get them, tiger!

02:14.884 --> 02:17.637
I saw that.
You're starting to like the gym.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.973
Oh. Yeah, the endorphins are contagious.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.266
That happens.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.561
One time, everyone caught
the same horrible rash from the yoga mats.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.648
-A staph infection?
-Not just staff, customers too.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.864
Chelsea Morgan?

02:36.573 --> 02:37.991
Oh, my God, it is you!

02:38.074 --> 02:41.327
Margot! Margot Wainwright.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.164
Quelle surprise!

02:44.247 --> 02:45.957
I was grabbing a macchiato

02:46.040 --> 02:48.918
when I looked and thought,
"Is that Chelsea from high school?"

02:49.002 --> 02:51.337
The salutatorian to my valedictorian?

02:51.421 --> 02:55.466
Oh, you, always bringing that up.
Our GPAs were neck and neck.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.760
With one neck longer than the other.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.430
-You're wondering why I'm in Los Angeles.
-I was not.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.849
I'm in town shopping my novel to agents.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.851
-Oh!
-It's looking highly competitive.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.312
Some people are saying
I'm a modern-day Tolstoy.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.773
Oh, well, you're certainly saying it.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.735
Gosh, this time
it's just been such a whirlwind.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.695
Maybe someday you'll understand.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.488
Though I doubt it.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.617
Oh, that reminds me!

03:20.700 --> 03:23.870
I'm giving a guest lecture
at UCLA tonight, you should come.

03:23.953 --> 03:24.954
Oh.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.376
You know, Margot, I'd love to,
but I have plans.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.296
Oh, of course, sorry.
How presumptuous of me.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.423
You must have lots to do here.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.468
The washing of the towels,
and the mopping of the sweat--

03:38.551 --> 03:40.845
I wrote a novel too. Yep.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.680
Yes, yes, I did.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.975
Um, uh, that's actually why
I can't come tonight.

03:46.059 --> 03:51.731
I have an event
for my novel that I started,

03:51.814 --> 03:55.401
worked on, and finished. My novel.

03:56.277 --> 04:00.198
This job at the gym
is purely for research purposes.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.201
My book is about a woman

04:04.202 --> 04:07.372
who is a competitive...

04:08.373 --> 04:09.666
weightlifter.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.336
A weightlifter?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.214
I can't imagine
there's much of a market for that.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.092
Well, there is, I sold it.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.552
That's what I'm celebrating tonight.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.179
Um, my boyfriend--

04:23.263 --> 04:26.557
-Did I mention my boyfriend who has a PhD?
-No. Okay.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.644
Yes, he has arranged an intimate dinner
at the house tonight

04:29.727 --> 04:32.563
with my agent to celebrate
the contract signing.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.775
He's hired a renowned private chef.
It's very chic.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.528
Oh, quite impressive.

04:39.237 --> 04:43.116
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
that sounds almost too good to be true.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.413
Well, it is.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.166
If you weren't busy tonight,
I would invite you to join us.

04:52.250 --> 04:57.338
-I would love to come!
-You can't because you have the lecture.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.924
It's fine. Malcolm Gladwell's speaking.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.678
You know Malc won't say no
to an extra half-hour of stage time.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.515
I really must run,
but text me your address,

05:07.598 --> 05:09.142
and I'll see you tonight. Hmm?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.269
Ciao!

05:11.352 --> 05:12.645
No!

05:16.065 --> 05:19.861
God, I can't believe I lied!
What was I thinking?

05:19.944 --> 05:22.155
She's just so Margot.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.325
When I got an A,
she would brag about her A-plus.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.827
When I got into Harvard,
she called it a safety school

05:27.910 --> 05:29.746
for people who couldn't get into Oxford.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.208
I actually went to my safety school.
The Middleton Academy for Boy Models.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.127
Go, Tigers!

05:37.920 --> 05:39.714
Now she's in town shopping her novel

05:39.797 --> 05:42.592
and all I've ever written
are three sad little words.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.012
"It was Tuesday."

05:46.888 --> 05:49.807
Hey, Tuesday's a great word!

05:49.891 --> 05:53.311
Tuesday! Tuesday!

05:53.394 --> 05:55.188
No, I think you've got something there.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.068
Oh, God. She keeps texting me
for the address.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.319
I'll just blow her off.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.029
And watch The Bachelor with us.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.908
Oh, yes, or I could get lost at sea.
Both great options.

06:06.991 --> 06:11.746
Or you send her our address
and we make your lie a reality.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.376
I'm not following.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.670
It's called pretending.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.173
So when Margot comes over,

06:22.256 --> 06:26.844
we're all going to pretend
like everything you said is true.

06:26.928 --> 06:31.349
You'll have an agent, a boyfriend,
a personal chef and a big fat book deal.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.687
This is nuts.
Why am I even considering this?

06:38.314 --> 06:41.734
Why am I still considering this?
Why have I not stopped considering this?

06:41.818 --> 06:43.361
Do it!

06:43.444 --> 06:46.531
Do it! Do it! Do it!

06:46.614 --> 06:48.282
Okay, okay, okay!

06:50.535 --> 06:53.246
-Let's do it.
-Oh, my gosh!

06:55.081 --> 06:57.542
Margot will be expecting my lit agent.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.877
Someone sharp, someone sophisticated.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.547
Solana, you were a lawyer.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.715
I'm on it, but I'll need
your full commitment

07:04.799 --> 07:06.968
that you're not working
with any other agents.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.554
This is all pretend so...

07:09.637 --> 07:12.515
I need that commitment
in writing by end of day.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.767
Okay.

07:14.851 --> 07:19.439
Next, I told Margot that this would be
catered by a professional chef.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.190
Claire, you think you can do that?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.735
Sure, I've got tons of food
prepared for Bachelor night.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.779
Remember, Margot's never met you,

07:26.863 --> 07:30.324
so tonight, you're not my sister,
you're a stranger.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.786
No hugs, no nicknames,
no trying to finish my sentences

07:33.870 --> 07:36.747
-because you think we speak the same--
-English. Got it.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.835
Okay. That just leaves the boyfriend.

07:40.918 --> 07:45.173
I can play straight, but I'd need
a full two weeks to prepare.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.966
Or I can be your boyfriend.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.350
Okay. Yeah, that's perfect.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.644
Yes, you will be the boyfriend,

07:58.728 --> 08:00.771
and we live here,

08:00.855 --> 08:04.442
and you're a brilliant PhD
in something Margot knows nothing about.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.944
So we'll tell her you're a...

08:07.695 --> 08:08.613
microbiologist.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.822
Got it.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.742
That leaves moi. What are we thinking,

08:12.825 --> 08:15.495
choose the wig first
and let the character flow from there?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.663
Jayden, we've been through this.

08:17.747 --> 08:22.335
I love you, but you always go so big
and you give the whole thing away.

08:22.418 --> 08:26.339
Not every character
needs a tragic backstory and an accent.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.174
Maybe Jayden can do something small.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.843
Yes! Like that time
I played a delivery man.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.137
Who you turned into an Oklahoma yokel

08:33.221 --> 08:35.348
who killed his own sister
in a silo accident?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.644
Pop told us not to play in there.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.355
But I just couldn't help myself.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.815
Sign here to confirm receipt.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.027
Jayden's out!
I'm sorry, it's just too important.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.445
Oh, fine!

08:52.156 --> 08:54.825
Okay, all right, the wheels are in motion,

08:54.909 --> 08:57.078
we'll get Margot in,
she'll see my amazing life,

08:57.161 --> 09:00.206
-and when she's squirming with envy...
-I'll bring out the contract.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.666
The nail in the coffin.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.210
And Margot will finally be jealous of me.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.587
I think this will work.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.215
This is never going to work!

09:10.299 --> 09:11.842
Why did I think this would work?

09:11.926 --> 09:15.179
Margot's intelligent.
Did I mention she went to Oxford?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.639
Because she did!

09:17.473 --> 09:20.476
I can't believe I was
desperate enough to agree to this!

09:21.811 --> 09:23.187
Oh, God.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.897
She's here.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.068
Okay, I'm opening the door.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.320
The door is opening.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.322
The door is open. Margot!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
-Hi!
-How lovely of you to come.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.410
I wouldn't miss it.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.121
And you must be the boyfriend.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.289
Welcome to our home.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.000
It's so nice to meet you.
Chelsea says you're a scientist.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.752
Yes. I'm a microwave-ologist.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.091
A microwave-ologist.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.927
Yes, that is what I said.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.890
Honey, why don't you check
on how dinner is coming?

09:59.974 --> 10:01.350
Sounds great.

10:03.144 --> 10:03.978
I'll miss you.

10:04.061 --> 10:04.895
Okay.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.108
Come on in.

10:10.693 --> 10:14.989
I don't care what it costs, if Franzen
gets 20% on the back end, so does Chelsea.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.324
Figure it out!

10:16.407 --> 10:19.702
-Solana Castellano, Chelsea's agent.
-Nice to meet you.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.912
I'm an author myself. Margot Wainwright.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.457
-Oh, Margot Wainwright.
-That's right.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.833
Never heard of you.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.919
Hi, I'm the chef.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.922
Barbie, Barbie Mattel.

10:33.966 --> 10:34.925
Like the doll?

10:35.009 --> 10:38.012
Your doll's name was Barbie too? Wow.

10:38.095 --> 10:41.015
Why don't you tell us
what's on the menu, Barbie?

10:41.098 --> 10:41.932
Totally.

10:42.016 --> 10:47.688
Tonight we will be enjoying salami roses,
cucumber roses and rose water sorbet.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.025
Why is everything rose-themed?

10:51.108 --> 10:52.860
-Because of The Bach--
-The book.

10:54.236 --> 10:58.532
Rose imagery features prominently,
and Chef Barbie...

10:59.575 --> 11:04.622
Mattel was kind enough to allude
to the text through her culinary craft.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.000
-Thank you so much.
-No probs, Chels.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.795
She's very informal.

11:11.462 --> 11:15.257
Yes, well, we're a little
more casual here on this coast.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.344
I popped a zit
for my gardener this morning.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.810
A glass of your finest
yet cheapest wine, Howard.

11:25.893 --> 11:30.564
We have a white blend, a red blend,
or I can blend you a milkshake.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.529
Oh, Howard. I can't even pretend
to laugh at your jokes right now.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.905
A white will do.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.075
Make me a chocolate malt
while you're at it.

11:46.914 --> 11:47.748
Rough day?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.543
It hurts to be excluded.

11:52.002 --> 11:56.006
You see, Howard, I'm the kind of person
whose light shines so bright

11:56.090 --> 11:58.718
and then other people complain,
and they say, "Stop!

11:58.801 --> 12:00.511
Our retinas are burning."

12:01.512 --> 12:04.682
And it's like, hello, put on sunglasses.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.770
Have you ever been rejected
for your gifts?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.772
Gosh, yeah.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.775
All the time. My mother and father
would sometimes ignore me--

12:14.859 --> 12:16.777
They don't want me there, it's fine.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.489
I'll just stay here and watch
The Bachelor pre-show.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.325
Which is Wheel of Fortune.
Can you put it on?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.369
Sure thing, Jayden.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.539
And your chocolate malt.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.087
Ugh.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.797
This is disgusting.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.258
Keep them coming.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.136
Keep them coming.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.435
I told Oprah, "Honey, don't beg,

12:49.518 --> 12:51.771
you'll read
Chelsea's book when you read it."

12:51.854 --> 12:54.064
I'm quite surprised, Chelsea.

12:54.148 --> 12:58.235
I still think of you as that
little 17-year-old nipping at my heels.

12:58.319 --> 13:04.366
Struggling to keep up, yet so determined,
despite all inevitability. Cute.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.328
Chelsea's achieved
a lot since then. Haven't you?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.664
Yes. I have.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.168
From the onset, my novel
has been a shining success.

13:14.251 --> 13:18.547
As soon as I wrote the first word,
the text simply poured out of me.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.758
A seamless flow of creative energy.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.635
Like a microwave.

13:25.179 --> 13:29.016
It was selling the novel
that brought a feeling of gratification

13:29.099 --> 13:32.311
far greater than the seven figures
that flooded my account.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.439
Maybe one day you'll understand.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.942
Though I doubt it.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.949
-I think it's time to sign that contract.
-Indeed.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.540
It's interesting, you mentioned
you wrote your novel quickly.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.958
Yes.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.501
That's so unlike you.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.504
The Chelsea I knew
was always paralyzed by the blank page.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.090
I recall the final
in-class essay in Honors English,

14:01.173 --> 14:04.260
you were so fixated
on getting every word just right,

14:04.343 --> 14:07.179
you could barely finish
the first sentence!

14:07.263 --> 14:12.017
Needless to say, it's hard to believe
you finished your novel so quickly.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.984
Well, that's what happened.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

14:21.318 --> 14:23.904
I'm gonna go check on that contract.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.159
The human head weighs eight pounds.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.958
So what if the title is profane in Greek?
We'll get more press!

14:36.041 --> 14:37.084
Hey!

14:37.167 --> 14:39.336
What are you doing?
She can't even hear you!

14:39.420 --> 14:43.340
Trust me! The more realistic this is,
the better you look. It's working.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.801
Not anymore. I think she's onto us.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.095
So, where did you and Chelsea meet?

14:49.096 --> 14:50.890
The farmer's market.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.267
Chelsea said it was the museum.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.269
It was.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.022
I was confusing the two
because isn't the farmer's market

14:58.105 --> 14:59.231
just a museum for fruit?

14:59.315 --> 15:00.858
Thank God you're back!

15:00.941 --> 15:02.776
Oh, okay.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.028
The contract is ready!

15:04.111 --> 15:07.156
Great, let's get it signed
and send Margot off to her lecture.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.449
Not before a toast!

15:08.532 --> 15:12.578
-Oh, God.
-Okay, everyone take one.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.955
-Thank you.
-It's so exciting.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.584
-Chelsea...
-Mm.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.212
writing a book has been a dream
of yours since you were a little girl.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.549
Or so I imagine because I just met you.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.760
But either way,

15:27.843 --> 15:30.888
you really deserve
everything you ever wished for.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.059
-And this is all I really wanted for you.
-Thank you, Barbie!

15:35.142 --> 15:37.645
Oh, very moving words from the chef.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.606
Can't wait to hear
what the boyfriend has to say.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.399
Ding, ding, ding.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.360
Right.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.738
-To Chelsea.
-To Chelsea.

15:47.821 --> 15:53.369
You wrote a book,
and we met at a museum...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.205
and...

15:57.164 --> 16:00.209
I don't know what else to say so...

16:12.554 --> 16:13.389
Whoo!

16:15.849 --> 16:18.060
I think that about covers it. Cheers!

16:18.143 --> 16:19.478
-Congrats!
-Cheers.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.021
Congratulations!

16:23.273 --> 16:24.316
Ugh. Finally.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.902
-Your signature here.
-Okay.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.532
And initial here.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.787
And here.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.084
That was supposed to be a signature,
so cross that out,

16:42.167 --> 16:43.711
initial the cross-out...

16:44.211 --> 16:45.254
and then sign.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.718
-And here.
-Oh.

16:53.762 --> 16:58.058
You can have as much wine as you want,
but you've had far too much milk.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.768
I'll be the judge of that.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
I've had far too much milk.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.404
Tonight on The Bachelor,
Hannah Z wasn't invited on the group date,

17:10.487 --> 17:12.906
but she shows up anyway.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.535
This is my time!
And I will not be excluded.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.163
You tell them, Hannah Z.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.041
You deserve to be on that group date.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.085
You pull your Spanx up,
you let your light shine bright.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.130
Howard! I have to--

17:29.423 --> 17:30.424
Throw up.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.634
Whoa.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.973
But after that,
I've got a group date to crash.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.185
My cousin knows Hannah Z.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.145
Oh, my God, is she in L.A. now?

17:43.979 --> 17:47.649
And your thumbprint here. And here.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.818
And we're done.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.906
Thank you so much, Margot, for coming.
What a wonderful evening.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.534
Oh, Chelsea,
all this pomp and circumstance

17:57.618 --> 18:00.245
has left my interest positively piqued.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.039
I must see this manuscript.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.583
Oh.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.044
No.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.130
You can't.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.301
Because the contract stipulates
we're not allowed to release

18:14.384 --> 18:16.261
any copies until publication.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.222
Especially in Greece.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.559
Yes, the novel is highly critical of...

18:23.477 --> 18:24.353
yogurt.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.440
But you should know, it's very good.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.069
Wait, sorry, Barbie the chef read it?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.074
No, I didn't read it.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.410
Chelsea read it to me.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.288
Oh, did she?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.750
Well, then it's settled.
You can read it to me as well.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.836
At least a passage or two.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.089
You know, Margot, I would,

18:52.172 --> 18:56.093
but unfortunately,
I don't have the manuscript.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.596
Here it is, my darling.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.307
Don't worry, it's just plain paper.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.563
Thank you, Grant. So helpful.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.858
Come, come, everyone. Let's listen.

19:12.484 --> 19:18.198
Okay, all right, I guess I'll just read
a passage aloud from my novel

19:18.282 --> 19:21.118
about a female weightlifter

19:21.785 --> 19:25.497
-and roses and-- Yogurt.
-Yogurt!

19:26.165 --> 19:27.374
Thank you, Margot.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.877
Oh, yes.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.507
-"It was Tuesday."
-I love that part.

19:36.925 --> 19:40.262
"Diane was finally able to steal away

19:40.345 --> 19:45.434
from the Olympic weightlifting trials
to visit the gravesite.

19:47.311 --> 19:51.732
In the pre-dawn light,
she approached Dimitri's headstone

19:52.232 --> 19:54.234
with a single rose.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.947
He had done all he could
to protect her from...

19:59.865 --> 20:01.617
the yogurt industry.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.706
Diane watched as the sun
made its ascent on the horizon.

20:08.498 --> 20:12.211
She turned
and with resigned determination,

20:12.294 --> 20:15.088
took her first steps into the future.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.758
Her face awash in golden light

20:17.841 --> 20:23.013
and the humble longing
for an unbounded tomorrow."

20:28.393 --> 20:29.895
That was...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.231
very...

20:32.940 --> 20:33.941
good.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.444
To be honest, when we spoke at the gym,
I assumed you were making it all up.

20:37.527 --> 20:41.782
But now I see you really did
write a beautiful novel,

20:41.865 --> 20:44.576
and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't...

20:45.869 --> 20:46.703
jealous.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.663
Oh.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.919
Well, that was not my intention.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.340
Don't sign that bloody contract!

20:58.423 --> 21:02.511
This two-faced sheila
of a book agent will double-cross you

21:02.594 --> 21:04.846
as soon as she gets the chance.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.975
-Jayden!
-I'm not Jayden, I'm Braden.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.686
Braden Bathwater!

21:11.228 --> 21:12.729
The other book agent.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.982
-Oh, God.
-Oh, no.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.650
This is bad.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.152
What's happening?
Why are you whispering?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.655
Are we done with the characters?
Is Margot gone?

21:21.738 --> 21:23.740
Wait, who's she? Who are you?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.785
Hi. I'm Margot.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.913
And this is amazing!

21:29.997 --> 21:33.750
Oh, Chelsea, wow!

21:33.834 --> 21:35.294
What a to-do.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.838
And all so you could pretend
that you wrote a book.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.048
Oh, how pathetic.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.344
Yes! You're right!

21:45.220 --> 21:49.683
Congratulations, Margot,
you are still more successful than me.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.435
But you know what?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.438
Maybe I'm okay with that.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.108
Maybe I like working at the gym

21:58.191 --> 22:01.528
and the little beeping sound
the thing makes when I swipe the cards,

22:01.611 --> 22:04.031
and maybe I like living with these people

22:04.114 --> 22:08.201
who care about me enough
to do something this ridiculous.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.578
And maybe...

22:10.746 --> 22:12.289
Maybe it's time for you to go...

22:13.832 --> 22:15.959
because I wanna watch The Bachelor.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.213
You want to watch The Bachelor?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.590
Yes!

22:22.591 --> 22:26.053
I'm tired of pretending to read while
I watch it out of the corner of my eye!

22:26.136 --> 22:29.348
Oh, reality television, how simple.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.352
I don't care what you think, Margot.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.438
I love everything about The Bachelor.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.692
The helicopter dates, the in-fighting.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.736
The verbal gymnastics
of saying "I love you"

22:42.819 --> 22:44.446
without saying "I love you."

22:44.529 --> 22:48.325
The surprise concerts
by obscure country music artists!

22:48.408 --> 22:50.285
And most of all,

22:50.369 --> 22:53.163
I love the sparkly dresses!

22:54.122 --> 22:55.791
Have a nice life, Margot!

22:58.502 --> 22:59.795
-Yes!
-Yeah!

23:00.962 --> 23:02.381
Oh, my God.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.430
Ah. Crazy night, right?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.602
Yeah. Yep.

23:16.853 --> 23:20.190
Oh, sorry about that.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.692
I forgot. You're not my girlfriend.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.781
Yeah. So true.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.865
Rose cake!

23:28.949 --> 23:34.121
Inspired by your novel
and our favorite show.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.958
And, Chelsea, can I just say?
You are a fantastic writer.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.292
Oh, that wasn't writing,

23:39.376 --> 23:42.129
that was just me making up
sentences out of thin air.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.173
Isn't that exactly what writing is?

23:47.300 --> 23:50.470
-That's a very good point.
-And I loved the way you read it out loud.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.139
Yeah. That should be a thing.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.517
-Like a sound book.
-You mean an audio book.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.644
No, a sound book.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.187
Oh, it's starting.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.359
Is that Hannah Z
crawling through a window?

24:04.443 --> 24:07.446
Yeah, she will not be excluded.
