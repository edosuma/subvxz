00:02.616 --> 00:04.559
In the criminal
justice system...

00:04.632 --> 00:08.080
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:08.151 --> 00:10.225
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:10.297 --> 00:12.053
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:12.121 --> 00:15.417
are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.391
These are their stories.

00:24.474 --> 00:26.678
You had to take a shortcut.

00:26.746 --> 00:28.885
I wouldn't have had to
if you would just once...

00:28.954 --> 00:30.646
get out of the house
on time.

00:30.715 --> 00:31.763
What's the big hurry?

00:31.834 --> 00:34.257
One of your girlfriends
supposed to be there?

00:34.331 --> 00:35.793
God, I hope so.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.802
Something just
fall out of there?

00:40.220 --> 00:41.814
I didn't see.

00:41.948 --> 00:44.566
Well, tell him
his doors came open.

00:46.205 --> 00:50.035
Excuse me,
your doors are open!

00:51.293 --> 00:52.667
Hello?

00:55.901 --> 00:57.309
What was that about?

00:57.374 --> 00:59.479
All I know is,
it's clear. Go.

00:59.550 --> 01:01.492
Well, did something
fall out of there or not?

01:01.567 --> 01:02.940
Just go.

01:05.406 --> 01:06.487
Stop.

01:09.312 --> 01:12.989
Name's Sophie Douglas, eight.
Guy cuffed her to this bar inside.

01:13.056 --> 01:14.911
She managed to wriggle
her hand out to escape.

01:14.976 --> 01:16.405
When'd she go missing?
Three days ago.

01:16.481 --> 01:19.962
We were working on it as a custodial
snatch. Mother was convinced it was her ex.

01:20.033 --> 01:22.041
No ransom.
Been a custody battle.

01:22.529 --> 01:23.936
The father,
we couldn't find him.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.660
But it was
a complete stranger.

01:25.729 --> 01:28.764
I see what you're thinking.
We screwed up, right?

01:28.866 --> 01:30.906
We're not thinking
anything.

01:31.778 --> 01:33.120
Mother's
in the waiting room.

01:33.186 --> 01:35.324
Doc's doing
the rape kit now.

01:39.747 --> 01:41.571
Sophie, I'm going to use
the cotton swab now.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.490
Just on the legs, okay?

01:49.444 --> 01:50.972
How's she doing?

01:52.517 --> 01:54.656
Fluids
on the inner thigh.

01:56.037 --> 01:57.313
Excuse me.

01:57.926 --> 02:01.374
All right, Sophie, we're going
to take some pictures now.

02:02.118 --> 02:04.387
Hi, Sophie.
Hi.

02:04.454 --> 02:07.106
My name is Olivia.
How you doing?

02:08.679 --> 02:09.725
I'm okay.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.629
I gotta fill up
this whole room with bubbles.

02:13.703 --> 02:16.388
I was wondering if you could help
me 'cause it's a pretty big room.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.977
A tear
at the posterior fourchette.

02:19.176 --> 02:22.111
Complete transection
of the hymen at 5:00.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.583
Entire introitus
swollen and red.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.920
He raped her.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

03:18.702 --> 03:21.320
We got a stranger-child
abduction with a confirmed rape.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.457
Name is Sophie Douglas, eight. Grabbed
four days ago, escaped last night.

03:24.526 --> 03:26.469
Tox screen came back positive
for tranquilizers.

03:26.543 --> 03:27.558
Well, where are we on it?

03:27.633 --> 03:30.250
We know the guy owns a white
van. That's it. No make, no model.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.335
No witnesses?

03:31.408 --> 03:33.262
Two of them sat behind the van
for 20 minutes.

03:33.328 --> 03:35.052
Couldn't give us
one number on the plate.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.673
Put out the word to other houses.
Start running known pedophiles...

03:37.744 --> 03:39.653
through DMV
for van owners.

03:39.729 --> 03:40.809
We're on it.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.342
Benson, Stabler,
interview the girl.

03:42.417 --> 03:45.767
Captain, the mother thinks she's
too traumatized to do it today.

03:45.875 --> 03:48.624
Well, tell Mrs. Douglas we
don't mean to be insensitive...

03:48.690 --> 03:52.172
but if we're going to catch
this guy, every second counts.

03:56.147 --> 03:59.049
What's everybody still doing
here? I thought I was late.

03:59.124 --> 04:02.440
We're having difficulty
separating mother and daughter.

04:04.307 --> 04:06.196
Sophie won't be able to
talk freely in front of her.

04:06.260 --> 04:08.267
Did you explain that?
Yep.

04:09.588 --> 04:12.655
All right. Have her come
into the viewing with us.

04:13.397 --> 04:15.339
Sophie,
that's such a pretty name.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.803
Now, Sophie, do you know
why you're here?

04:19.668 --> 04:21.327
Because of the man.

04:21.526 --> 04:25.782
Yeah. I'm going to ask you some
questions about the man, if that's okay.

04:26.518 --> 04:27.500
Okay.

04:27.575 --> 04:31.088
Okay. The man's skin,
what color was it?

04:32.471 --> 04:34.162
Like ours.
Like ours.

04:34.231 --> 04:37.167
And his hair?
What color was his hair?

04:37.240 --> 04:40.818
Was it sort of dark like mine,
or was it lighter like yours?

04:41.496 --> 04:43.089
I can't remember.

04:44.473 --> 04:45.880
He had scary teeth.

04:46.105 --> 04:48.342
Scary?
What was scary about them?

04:48.473 --> 04:50.578
They looked like
a monster's.

04:51.162 --> 04:54.391
So tell me,
how did you meet this man?

04:55.290 --> 04:58.455
My mom says I'm supposed
to go straight home, but...

05:00.251 --> 05:01.778
I saw a puppy.

05:01.851 --> 05:04.469
Did the man have this puppy?
No.

05:05.243 --> 05:06.901
I didn't want to
get in the van.

05:06.972 --> 05:10.201
We know that, Sophie, honey.
It's okay. We know that.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.729
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

05:12.795 --> 05:14.487
Did you hear what she said?

05:14.556 --> 05:15.637
It's okay, Sophie.

05:15.709 --> 05:17.367
Stop. It's too much for her.

05:17.436 --> 05:20.154
Mrs. Douglas, I know this is painful,
but it's gonna take some time.

05:20.222 --> 05:22.163
How long are you planning
to put her through this?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.580
We don't want
to rush her.

05:23.646 --> 05:27.224
Then let me bring her back in a couple
of days when she's more up to it.

05:27.294 --> 05:31.451
Olivia, we're in a bit of a time
crunch here. We need the location now.

05:31.901 --> 05:34.204
Sophie, let's talk
about the van.

05:35.359 --> 05:38.970
When you were inside, could
you see any of the street signs?

05:40.447 --> 05:41.428
No.

05:41.919 --> 05:44.636
Did the man say
anything to you in the van?

05:45.856 --> 05:47.995
He didn't talk
until the room.

05:48.065 --> 05:49.274
The room?

05:50.304 --> 05:52.378
He said
it was my Party Day.

05:53.826 --> 05:56.477
There were lots of
balloons and stuff...

05:57.761 --> 05:59.584
but it wasn't a real party.

05:59.649 --> 06:00.827
Why not?

06:02.721 --> 06:04.861
Because nobody else
was there.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.624
Sophie, what happened
at the party?

06:12.195 --> 06:14.268
I had cupcakes and punch...

06:15.492 --> 06:17.531
but then I fell asleep.

06:17.987 --> 06:20.803
And when I woke up,
he was staring at me...

06:21.157 --> 06:23.644
and he said it was time
to get ready.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.335
Get ready for what?

06:27.749 --> 06:29.122
Picture Day.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.385
I had to wear
lots of costumes.

06:33.317 --> 06:35.106
What kind of
costumes?

06:37.127 --> 06:38.785
A fairy princess...

06:39.654 --> 06:41.216
and a mermaid...

06:42.246 --> 06:43.620
and a ballerina.

06:46.343 --> 06:49.026
So he took pictures
all day?

06:49.351 --> 06:51.719
I told him
I can dress myself,

06:51.975 --> 06:54.278
but he said he had to
help me anyway.

06:54.728 --> 06:56.386
I started crying.

06:56.456 --> 06:57.471
I'm going in there.

06:57.545 --> 06:59.617
Benson knows what she's doing.
Sophie's in good hands.

06:59.689 --> 07:00.704
She needs me.

07:00.777 --> 07:03.144
She needs to focus. She
won't be able to if you go in.

07:03.209 --> 07:04.965
Look, I'm not letting her
relive this again.

07:05.033 --> 07:09.190
Mrs. Douglas, do you want to catch
the man who is responsible for this?

07:10.538 --> 07:12.359
I want him dead.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.483
Then you've got to
help us.

07:17.322 --> 07:18.882
Get to day three.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.935
Sophie, you said that there was
a Party Day and a Picture Day.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.561
Did he have a name
for the next day?

07:29.228 --> 07:30.690
My Special Day.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.603
And what happened then?

07:34.891 --> 07:37.348
He said I
had to be very clean.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.130
So I had to take
a bubble bath.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.627
It's all my fault.

07:43.694 --> 07:45.668
No, Sophie,
this is not your fault.

07:45.902 --> 07:48.586
He said he had
more puppies in his van.

07:48.654 --> 07:50.411
I just wanted
to see them.

07:50.959 --> 07:52.007
I love puppies.

07:52.078 --> 07:54.348
It's okay, Sophie, I
understand. I love puppies, too.

07:54.415 --> 07:57.350
There was a big box
way in the back of the van.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.423
I climbed in it
to see them, but...

08:02.127 --> 08:03.655
Please don't tell my mom.

08:03.728 --> 08:06.118
Sophie,
listen to me.

08:06.193 --> 08:08.233
Your mom is not mad at you,
nobody is.

08:08.304 --> 08:10.726
Everybody knows
that this man tricked you.

08:10.801 --> 08:12.623
I broke the rule.
No.

08:12.688 --> 08:14.543
All I wanted to do
was see the puppies.

08:14.609 --> 08:17.097
Honey, that's okay.
I understand.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.536
Mommy.
Sophie.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.663
It's okay, honey,
it's okay.

08:22.738 --> 08:23.884
I'm sorry.

08:23.954 --> 08:24.970
It's okay.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.081
Mrs. Douglas.

08:28.147 --> 08:30.865
No. No more.
This is enough.

08:31.346 --> 08:33.322
I am taking her
home now.

08:38.772 --> 08:41.554
Well, you know, she's not
bringing her back anytime soon.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.602
If at all.

08:42.676 --> 08:45.743
Well, if she continues to be
uncooperative, we still have legal recourse.

08:45.812 --> 08:48.661
Puts her in the room. It doesn't
pull the words out of her.

08:48.725 --> 08:51.856
I wouldn't put my girls
through it. You don't know.

08:52.885 --> 08:55.025
Well, after all that,
we don't have much to go on.

08:55.093 --> 08:58.574
Then we re-canvass. Let's just
start where he abducted her.

08:58.646 --> 09:02.029
Maybe Munch and Fin are having
better luck with the van.

09:03.223 --> 09:06.485
Oliver Tunney, a. k.a. Jolly
Ollie, a. k.a. Squiggles the Clown.

09:06.552 --> 09:08.046
I don't see
fortune cookies.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.732
Molested the kids he was paid
to entertain. Owns a white van.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.190
How many times you gonna read
that? Where the fortune cookies at?

09:14.264 --> 09:16.174
They're always stale.
Told 'em to forget it.

09:16.249 --> 09:18.420
What?
There's our clown now.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.969
What's shaking there,
Bozo?

09:27.194 --> 09:28.088
Who are you?

09:28.153 --> 09:29.910
Detective Tutuola
and Munch.

09:29.978 --> 09:31.222
You been keeping
your nose clean?

09:31.290 --> 09:32.632
The red rubber one?

09:32.699 --> 09:35.065
That's not funny.
Where you been all day?

09:35.131 --> 09:37.171
In Connecticut,
painting a house.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.185
I got my own business.
It's legit.

09:39.547 --> 09:41.817
House painting?
Yeah.

09:42.619 --> 09:44.921
Unmarked white van. You
mind if I take a look inside?

09:44.988 --> 09:46.679
Matter of fact,
I do.

09:46.748 --> 09:48.537
Been up to your
old tricks there, Ollie?

09:48.605 --> 09:53.362
No. I learned my lesson. Sing
Sing taught me impulse control.

09:53.436 --> 09:55.325
Well, how do you explain
this clown paint?

09:55.389 --> 09:58.237
It's house paint. I just
told you, I paint houses.

09:58.301 --> 09:59.642
It must have got on me.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.619
Looks like
probable cause to me.

10:01.694 --> 10:03.603
Mr. Tunney, I'm going to
have to ask you...

10:03.678 --> 10:04.790
to step away from the van.

10:04.862 --> 10:07.131
Come on, guys.
Give me a break.

10:08.639 --> 10:11.770
You violated your parole.
You're coming with us.

10:13.887 --> 10:15.448
We found balloons
in your van.

10:15.519 --> 10:16.698
After a little dusting...

10:16.767 --> 10:18.459
we'll find the girl's
fingerprints, too.

10:18.527 --> 10:20.633
She's ready and willing
to pick you out of a lineup.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.094
Tell us what happened. We can
help you. Make things easier.

10:23.168 --> 10:26.168
I didn't give
no girl a party.

10:26.272 --> 10:28.280
Then why aren't you
giving us an alibi?

10:28.353 --> 10:30.873
Surely somebody
saw you this weekend.

10:31.873 --> 10:35.550
Found this going through your
belongings, Tunney. Interesting.

10:35.905 --> 10:38.524
Only the children's events
are circled.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.316
That doesn't mean anything.

10:40.386 --> 10:41.848
Yeah, so we made
some calls.

10:41.922 --> 10:45.697
See, witnesses said they saw you
at the county fair in Norwalk.

10:46.818 --> 10:49.536
See? I told you
I didn't do it.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.292
I'm innocent.

10:51.363 --> 10:52.738
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll be...

10:52.804 --> 10:54.234
Not so fast there,
Chuckles.

10:54.308 --> 10:57.375
Those same witnesses filed complaints
about the touchy-feely games...

10:57.445 --> 10:58.590
that you play
with those kids.

10:58.661 --> 11:02.207
Connecticut authorities would
like to have a word with you.

11:06.789 --> 11:08.316
How did
the re-canvassing go?

11:08.389 --> 11:10.594
Broad daylight,
nobody saw nothing.

11:10.662 --> 11:12.354
Mrs. Douglas
returned your call.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.700
Says she wants Sophie to have more
healing time before you talk to her again.

11:16.775 --> 11:20.931
Okay. Hey, you guys, it's going
on 8:00. We're fresh out of leads.

11:21.672 --> 11:23.974
What do you say
we call it a day?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.048
I've still got time
to go to the toy store.

11:27.112 --> 11:28.639
Kathy's gonna faint
when she finds out...

11:28.712 --> 11:31.712
I got the twins' birthday
present two days early.

11:32.455 --> 11:35.326
Hey, it's me.
We still on for dinner?

11:36.648 --> 11:39.366
I think so. Okay.
See you then.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.793
How's Mr. Perfect?

11:41.865 --> 11:44.037
He's good. Of course,
I've only met him once...

11:44.106 --> 11:46.408
and the only time I talk to him
is when I'm calling to cancel.

11:46.474 --> 11:47.751
But other than that,
great.

11:47.818 --> 11:49.411
You got any plans tonight,
Munch?

11:49.482 --> 11:50.824
No. But the night is young...

11:50.890 --> 11:53.094
and the world is full of
endless possibilities.

11:55.788 --> 11:57.249
Everybody stays.

11:57.323 --> 11:58.468
Why?

11:58.699 --> 12:01.351
Man in a white van
grabbed another girl.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.243
All he got was beer?
So says the owner.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.107
Yeah, a six-pack,
the one on special.

12:16.173 --> 12:18.116
How long after you left
did Mrs. Guzek arrive?

12:18.189 --> 12:19.302
No customers between.

12:19.374 --> 12:21.796
I want you to tell me everything
you remember about him.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.292
American. 6 feet. Drunk.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.341
Eye color?
Hair color?

12:26.926 --> 12:28.869
Any distinguishing
characteristics?

12:28.943 --> 12:31.561
The teeth. The teeth were
very unfortunate.

12:31.631 --> 12:32.810
Unfortunate?

12:32.879 --> 12:34.984
Like Austin Powers.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.085
They pull that tape yet?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.649
That was broken when I bought
it. But I figured it was...

12:40.720 --> 12:42.444
better than nothing.
Yeah, that's brilliant.

12:42.513 --> 12:46.288
No chance this guy salvaged my crapfest
of a day by using a credit card, is there?

12:46.353 --> 12:48.809
No. It was
the last $20 I got.

12:48.881 --> 12:53.617
I remember distinctly, because he asked
me for $2 of his change in quarters.

12:54.001 --> 12:56.140
Harry, write him a receipt
for the top $20 in that drawer.

12:56.211 --> 12:57.771
See if the lab
can lift a print off it.

12:57.841 --> 12:59.566
You got it.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.839
So I had one foot out the door
when I heard a bottle smash.

13:01.907 --> 13:02.855
What'd you see?

13:02.931 --> 13:05.681
The back door of the van slamming shut
and peeling out a few seconds later...

13:05.748 --> 13:06.762
from this spot right here.

13:06.836 --> 13:08.397
And this would be
the bottle smash you heard?

13:08.467 --> 13:12.146
Yeah, there was a bag with the rest
of the six-pack right beside it.

13:12.212 --> 13:13.457
You see the driver
of the car?

13:13.524 --> 13:14.506
No.

13:14.581 --> 13:17.897
But I might have caught a piece of
the license plate. It started with "H."

13:17.972 --> 13:20.756
Or it might've been "B." I'm not
sure. Look, is it okay if I go?

13:20.821 --> 13:22.228
The cold's
really not good for her.

13:22.294 --> 13:23.242
Yeah. Thank you.

13:24.214 --> 13:25.938
Our guy asked
for quarters inside.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.340
I don't see any arcades
or Laundromats around here.

13:28.406 --> 13:30.195
Maybe he needed
to make some calls.

13:30.263 --> 13:34.005
He sees Mrs. Guzek go in the
store. Kirsten's alone in the car.

13:34.102 --> 13:37.037
Nobody's around. Can't
see the car from inside.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.054
He grabs the girl, takes her
to the back door of the van.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.454
Drops the beer right here
during the struggle.

13:42.519 --> 13:44.691
Closes the door behind him.
Cuffs her to the bar.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.062
Jumps in the front
and takes off.

13:47.448 --> 13:49.653
I'm pulling LUDs
on this phone.

13:50.425 --> 13:51.734
Harry.

13:51.801 --> 13:52.784
Yeah.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.318
Dust this baby off.

13:54.392 --> 13:57.710
I know it's a long shot, but pop that
box and dust the quarters, too, all right?

13:57.785 --> 13:59.346
No problem. Joe.

14:03.835 --> 14:06.224
The car was parked
right out front.

14:07.323 --> 14:09.745
I was only in the market
for a minute.

14:09.819 --> 14:14.576
They were almost home. I called on
the cell to pick up cigarettes for me.

14:15.579 --> 14:18.808
It was so cold out, so I
let Kirsten wait in the car.

14:19.611 --> 14:20.889
How could I do that?

14:20.957 --> 14:25.691
Mrs. Guzek, did you see anyone
around the white van when you went in?

14:25.757 --> 14:26.740
No.

14:27.261 --> 14:29.978
Can you get us Kirsten's
most recent photo?

14:35.103 --> 14:37.076
It's way past her bedtime.

14:37.598 --> 14:39.965
Please, God,
don't let him hurt my baby.

14:40.063 --> 14:43.293
Mrs. Guzek, we're going to do
everything that we can.

14:43.392 --> 14:44.952
We want you
to try to remember.

14:45.022 --> 14:48.219
Did you see anything when
you came out of the store?

14:48.319 --> 14:50.142
Just the open car door.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.233
It was like a live wire hit
me. I kept screaming her name.

14:55.169 --> 14:56.510
But I knew.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.160
It's from our last vacation.

15:00.064 --> 15:02.073
She just turned eight.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.130
We're positive
it's the same guy?

15:11.202 --> 15:13.307
Unless there's a white-van-driving,
dentally-challenged...

15:13.378 --> 15:15.353
pedophile convention
in town, I'd say yes.

15:15.427 --> 15:17.848
Well, why would this guy
risk another grab so soon?

15:17.923 --> 15:21.370
Store owner said he was intox. People
tend to drink when they got worries.

15:21.443 --> 15:24.477
Guy had to be worried somebody
could ID him from Sophie.

15:24.547 --> 15:26.238
When nobody comes for him
by the next day...

15:26.308 --> 15:29.026
he figures nobody caught his tags,
he's safe. He ventures back out.

15:29.092 --> 15:30.686
We got two different
approaches.

15:30.756 --> 15:33.177
Sophie was organized.
He used the puppy con.

15:33.253 --> 15:35.675
Kirsten, it was an
impulse grab. Blitz attack.

15:35.748 --> 15:38.138
Our guy's flexible.
No way he's a first-timer.

15:38.213 --> 15:40.767
We were supposed to have the
city-wide open cases for the past five.

15:40.837 --> 15:42.725
Where the hell are they?

15:43.270 --> 15:45.059
You know,
it's 1:30 in the morning.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.720
If he's following
the same schedule...

15:46.790 --> 15:48.677
she had Party Day
when he got her home.

15:48.741 --> 15:50.368
Picture Day's
in about eight hours.

15:50.438 --> 15:52.381
I got a little more description
from the store owner.

15:52.455 --> 15:53.885
I'm gonna run it
through the PIMs machine.

15:53.959 --> 15:57.733
I guess I could run partial plates on
vans. Look for an "H" in a haystack.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.782
Or a "B."

15:58.855 --> 16:00.165
Or a "B."

16:03.432 --> 16:05.408
It's after 3:00. Any luck?

16:05.481 --> 16:07.619
Got a lot of bad-mouthed
mothers here.

16:07.689 --> 16:10.951
Bucktooth, snaggletooth,
mangled tooth, missing tooth.

16:11.049 --> 16:13.416
I thought you got
a little more on the pedigree.

16:13.482 --> 16:16.100
Just the approximate height.
That really narrowed it down.

16:16.170 --> 16:19.073
Yeah. Well,
keep doing what you're doing.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.480
How goes it, Elliot?

16:26.186 --> 16:29.286
Hey, I made that.
19 hours ago, mind you...

16:29.356 --> 16:31.144
but still,
a little tact.

16:31.211 --> 16:33.578
Hey, Munch, why do you do
this? You always do this.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.749
He puts the lid back
on an empty can.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.478
It's just my way.
I'm getting coffee.

16:37.549 --> 16:39.937
Double espresso.
No-foam 2% latte.

16:40.043 --> 16:41.605
Pastrami on rye?

16:42.349 --> 16:46.506
Files ordered by Det. Benson.
Where do you want them?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.908
Captain,
we need an incident room.

16:53.069 --> 16:54.182
Liv.

16:54.254 --> 16:55.748
What time is it?

16:55.822 --> 16:57.251
3:10.
Oh, no.

16:57.326 --> 17:01.701
Yeah, I know. I know you didn't get your
full 30, but the files just got here.

17:06.767 --> 17:10.990
I have read the same paragraph five times,
and I still have no idea what it says.

17:11.472 --> 17:14.406
8:00 a. m. If I remember my
elementary school mathematics...

17:14.481 --> 17:16.935
we've been working
24 straight hours.

17:17.009 --> 17:19.048
He's had
Kirsten for 12.

17:19.634 --> 17:21.259
Can I have some of that?
No.

17:21.329 --> 17:22.278
Please.
No.

17:22.353 --> 17:23.335
Come on.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.319
Can't share eye drops.
That's how you get pinkeye.

17:25.394 --> 17:27.117
Just give him the eye drops.
You know something?

17:27.185 --> 17:28.680
We're just spinning
our wheels here.

17:28.754 --> 17:31.341
You and me,
we gotta do something.

17:33.236 --> 17:35.374
Elliot,
what's the plan?

17:35.443 --> 17:37.167
We've gotta talk
to Sophie right now.

17:37.235 --> 17:39.122
Her mother was adamant
about giving her more time.

17:39.187 --> 17:41.839
That was before
he grabbed another girl.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.522
Absolutely not.

17:45.588 --> 17:48.490
Mrs. Douglas, I know you don't
want this girl to go through...

17:48.564 --> 17:49.873
what your daughter did.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.723
Sophie has told you everything
that she remembers.

17:52.789 --> 17:55.311
She might be able to remember
new details that can help us.

17:55.381 --> 18:00.050
Do you know that Sophie slept in my bed
last night and woke up every hour crying?

18:00.118 --> 18:01.973
I am not going to let her
live through this again.

18:02.037 --> 18:05.202
But there's another girl
living through it right now.

18:05.271 --> 18:07.343
Look, she can't give you
an address.

18:07.414 --> 18:09.804
I'm sorry, Detectives, but I'm
not going to let you torture her.

18:09.878 --> 18:13.839
Mrs. Douglas, we can have a judge
compel you to let us talk to her.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.202
Well, then, that's what
you're going to have to do.

18:18.040 --> 18:22.001
He's had Kirsten 18 hours. We could
still find him before he rapes her.

18:22.073 --> 18:25.521
No one is more sensitive to this
situation than Mrs. Douglas...

18:25.593 --> 18:27.862
but her daughter
has no more information.

18:27.929 --> 18:29.784
We don't know that
until we talk to her.

18:29.849 --> 18:31.376
You already did.

18:32.217 --> 18:34.356
Mrs. Douglas terminated
that session prematurely...

18:34.426 --> 18:35.833
leaving a lot of ground
uncovered.

18:35.898 --> 18:38.103
Ground that could serve
no other purpose...

18:38.170 --> 18:39.732
than to further
traumatize the girl.

18:39.802 --> 18:41.908
She will be questioned by
Special Victims detectives.

18:41.979 --> 18:43.953
They do have some
experience in the area.

18:44.027 --> 18:48.086
She's already told them everything
that she knows. It's just cruel.

18:48.443 --> 18:50.931
Judge, please
don't make her do this.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.556
As a parent, I understand
your concern for your child.

18:54.973 --> 18:58.355
But I have to weigh that
against the welfare of another.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.110
I'm granting
the application.

19:01.309 --> 19:04.626
Mrs. Douglas, you are ordered
to produce your daughter.

19:08.638 --> 19:10.547
So, Sophie,
what grade are you in?

19:10.621 --> 19:11.451
Third.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.908
Third.
And do you like to read?

19:15.678 --> 19:17.140
Yeah,
me, too.

19:18.046 --> 19:20.982
When your mom brings home
takeout, like pizza...

19:21.056 --> 19:23.925
do you ever notice the name
and the address on the box?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.276
DeCarlo's.

19:25.568 --> 19:29.246
I forget the street, but we can
walk there from where we live.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.984
And did you have any takeout
food or pizza with the man?

19:35.936 --> 19:37.847
Hey, Sophie,
it's okay.

19:37.921 --> 19:40.310
We're not going to talk about
anything bad that happened there.

19:40.385 --> 19:41.912
I promise, okay?

19:45.218 --> 19:48.666
So tell me, what did you get
to eat when you were there?

19:49.986 --> 19:51.896
Cupcakes and fruit punch.

19:52.963 --> 19:54.392
And what else?

19:55.459 --> 19:58.624
Corn candy,
like you get on Halloween.

19:59.203 --> 20:02.270
That sounds good. But
what'd you have for dinner?

20:02.820 --> 20:06.268
Cupcakes and fruit punch
and corn candy the whole time.

20:06.436 --> 20:07.865
Nothing else?

20:09.030 --> 20:12.063
No. That's all we ever had.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.740
Now, Sophie, I need you
to think really hard.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.836
Do you ever remember the man
wearing a shirt with his name on it?

20:23.079 --> 20:26.244
No? Do you remember anything
with a name on it?

20:30.983 --> 20:35.010
A streamer at the party.
It had my name on it...

20:35.561 --> 20:37.503
in squares,
with glitter.

20:37.576 --> 20:41.351
Okay, good. And tell me, what
else? What else was at the party?

20:43.625 --> 20:44.803
Balloons.

20:45.737 --> 20:48.192
He blew them up
with a big machine...

20:48.266 --> 20:51.430
and then he talked
like a cartoon.

20:53.674 --> 20:55.136
If he had a Sophie banner...

20:55.210 --> 20:57.415
that means that he went
shopping after he abducted her.

20:57.482 --> 21:00.353
Only, what, a thousand stores
sell party supplies?

21:00.427 --> 21:01.856
How many of them
rent helium tanks?

21:01.931 --> 21:03.393
Should narrow it down
considerably.

21:03.467 --> 21:04.896
And if we give half
to Munch and Fin...

21:04.971 --> 21:07.722
When we're there, remind me to get
decorations for the twins' party.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.603
I don't want to have to use
crime-scene tape for it.

21:14.924 --> 21:16.038
You're way off on the face.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.091
You know him?

21:17.165 --> 21:19.434
There's this guy,
when he smiles...

21:19.502 --> 21:21.356
it takes a real effort
not to flinch.

21:21.422 --> 21:22.502
It might be him.

21:22.573 --> 21:23.915
He come through
here yesterday?

21:23.982 --> 21:25.127
I didn't work yesterday.

21:25.198 --> 21:27.369
But if it's the guy I'm
thinking of, he was here Friday.

21:27.438 --> 21:30.122
He didn't by any chance
get a helium tank, did he?

21:30.223 --> 21:31.783
Yeah, that's him.

21:31.854 --> 21:33.863
Could you get the credit
card receipt for me, please?

21:33.934 --> 21:34.982
He paid cash.

21:35.055 --> 21:37.739
You had to take ID on the
deposit on the tank, didn't you?

21:37.807 --> 21:41.452
We have these cute little
mini-tanks now. He just bought it.

21:42.223 --> 21:43.630
How regular
does he come in here?

21:43.697 --> 21:46.118
Every few weeks or so.
Mostly for the seasonal candy.

21:46.192 --> 21:48.135
We're one of the only places
that sells it year-round.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.216
Seasonal candy?
You know, candy canes...

21:50.289 --> 21:53.672
marshmallow chicks, chocolate
bunnies. It's right there.

21:55.090 --> 21:56.781
That's what he gets,
the candy corn.

21:56.850 --> 21:59.981
If I were him, with those
teeth, I'd lay off the sugar.

22:00.179 --> 22:01.323
Thanks.

22:03.379 --> 22:05.583
I want two men on that
party shop 9:00 to 9:00.

22:05.651 --> 22:08.914
Nobody so much as takes a pee
break without somebody covering.

22:09.011 --> 22:10.155
Benson.

22:10.548 --> 22:13.614
Michael, hi.
I am so sorry.

22:14.323 --> 22:17.074
Yeah, we have kind of a
cluster going on here, so...

22:17.139 --> 22:19.507
Every day till the end
of creation. How's that?

22:19.571 --> 22:21.874
I really can't talk right now,
so let me call you later, okay?

22:21.940 --> 22:22.922
All right, thanks.

22:22.996 --> 22:24.590
LUDs on that payphone
come back yet?

22:24.661 --> 22:28.786
Not yet. Kath, you know, I do
know how important it is, baby.

22:29.077 --> 22:30.539
But... Okay.

22:30.997 --> 22:32.175
Yeah, I don't know.

22:32.245 --> 22:34.252
Well, I'll give you a call
in a couple of hours.

22:34.326 --> 22:35.700
Okay. Bye-bye.

22:35.767 --> 22:38.833
Kathy now informs me
we've been working 36 hours.

22:38.903 --> 22:40.113
I got something.

22:40.182 --> 22:41.873
Tell me again everything
he gave Sophie to eat.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.114
Cupcakes and fruit punch.

22:44.183 --> 22:45.296
And candy corn.

22:45.368 --> 22:47.735
I extended the parameters.
I got three autopsy reports...

22:47.800 --> 22:50.418
with those exact same
stomach contents.

22:50.487 --> 22:55.092
We got a girl from the Bronx in
'98, one in Brooklyn in '99...

22:55.160 --> 22:57.462
and a Long Island girl
last year.

22:57.912 --> 22:59.221
All three
were strangled.

22:59.289 --> 23:01.940
All three were killed three
days after they went missing.

23:02.009 --> 23:03.700
All three were found in water.

23:03.770 --> 23:04.947
How did nobody
see the pattern?

23:05.018 --> 23:06.447
All from different boroughs.

23:06.521 --> 23:08.049
One of them wasn't found
for two weeks.

23:08.122 --> 23:11.188
The M.E. put T.O.D.
11 days prior. The third day.

23:11.962 --> 23:13.336
Sophie escaped
on her third day.

23:13.402 --> 23:14.831
Six blocks
from the East River.

23:14.906 --> 23:17.722
Kirsten begins her
third day in the morning.

23:20.027 --> 23:22.067
I take it we're all staying.

23:28.381 --> 23:32.440
Eight-year-old Rhonda Simmons,
abducted three years ago in the Bronx.

23:32.604 --> 23:34.493
Raped, strangled and dumped
in the East River.

23:34.557 --> 23:36.826
Body washed up
by the Navy Yards.

23:36.893 --> 23:40.090
A year and a half later, we got Sheila
Wells, seven. Grabbed from Greenpoint.

23:40.158 --> 23:42.841
Raped, strangled.
Sewer workers found her.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.684
Back at it a year later. Kira Bly,
a nine-year-old from Manhasset.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.653
Same M.O. Found her in the Sound.
Are we sensing a pattern yet?

23:49.727 --> 23:51.669
He's accelerating.
Only six months...

23:51.743 --> 23:53.980
before Sophie.
A day before Kirsten.

23:55.104 --> 23:57.079
No DNA on Rhonda.
How about you guys?

23:57.151 --> 23:58.526
Zero.

23:58.656 --> 24:01.306
Water washes away all sins,
or at least all DNA.

24:01.377 --> 24:03.198
Any other similarities?

24:03.265 --> 24:06.112
All five of them are white,
between the ages of seven and nine.

24:06.177 --> 24:07.966
All come from
working-class families...

24:08.065 --> 24:09.472
described as
cute and outgoing.

24:09.538 --> 24:11.359
Guy's probably a loner.

24:11.906 --> 24:13.727
Impulsive,
socially marginalized.

24:13.794 --> 24:15.899
Okay, is this a smart guy,
or is he just fickle?

24:15.970 --> 24:17.377
He keeps changing
his hunting grounds.

24:17.442 --> 24:19.547
I mean, are we dealing with
a salesman, maybe a mover?

24:19.619 --> 24:21.277
Let's check out
the grab sites.

24:21.345 --> 24:23.070
The first one
was in the Bronx.

24:23.139 --> 24:25.146
Next was
the Brooklyn North territory.

24:25.219 --> 24:27.739
Then he moves over to Long
Island and crosses to Manhattan.

24:27.811 --> 24:28.891
He's moving
up in affluence.

24:28.963 --> 24:30.426
His confidence
is building.

24:30.499 --> 24:34.558
One P.P. again. They need to release.
I can't keep putting them off.

24:38.724 --> 24:39.968
I'm not tipping
all of you.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.444
Sorry, Captain.
We got a problem.

24:41.508 --> 24:42.818
Brass wants
to go public.

24:42.885 --> 24:43.900
Well,
it's their call.

24:43.973 --> 24:45.348
Well, what we
give them is ours.

24:45.413 --> 24:46.591
I'm listening.

24:46.661 --> 24:48.669
Hold back the van.
It's our only solid lead.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.268
The second it's out,
he'll dump it.

24:50.342 --> 24:52.415
So he dumps it? We get a
whole van full of new evidence.

24:52.485 --> 24:54.722
Or he hightails it out of
town, which helps us not.

24:54.791 --> 24:55.871
Elliot?
Best-case scenario:

24:55.943 --> 24:57.121
Someone sees him,
turns him in.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.205
Release the composite.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.450
Hey, who died
and left you Captain?

25:00.519 --> 25:02.374
Lest we forget
the worst-case scenario.

25:02.438 --> 25:03.716
Morning paper comes out...

25:03.784 --> 25:05.693
and we get a deluge
of phone calls from whackos.

25:05.767 --> 25:07.807
The woman turning in the ex
who done them wrong.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.888
Neighbors turning in
the freak down the street.

25:09.959 --> 25:11.935
Leaving us here answering
thousands of false leads...

25:12.009 --> 25:13.470
instead of out there
finding Kirsten.

25:13.544 --> 25:18.149
Or our guy reads the paper, he
panics, and he starts making mistakes.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.843
This guy is ritual.

25:19.912 --> 25:23.013
He starts with Party Day, next is
Picture Day, and in a few hours...

25:23.082 --> 25:25.286
Kirsten begins
her Special Day.

25:26.794 --> 25:30.090
Release the composite, a description of
the van, but hold back the time clock.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.715
Who is that woman?

25:32.458 --> 25:35.394
Mrs. Simmons, mother of one
of the dead girls.

25:36.267 --> 25:37.828
Whose turn is it?

25:42.189 --> 25:44.773
I'm sorry.
I know you're terribly busy.

25:45.932 --> 25:47.525
It's fine, really.

25:47.661 --> 25:50.278
It's just, they never had
a single lead.

25:51.438 --> 25:53.292
I brought this
for you.

25:55.631 --> 25:58.380
You should really keep that.
We've one in the file.

25:58.445 --> 25:59.907
Not this one.

26:01.039 --> 26:03.177
This is her
last school photo.

26:04.879 --> 26:08.229
It came in the mail three
weeks after she was murdered.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.790
I want it in your pocket
when you catch him.

26:16.624 --> 26:19.439
Fin, I don't see latent
on the pay phone.

26:19.504 --> 26:21.097
We didn't get it.

26:21.169 --> 26:22.629
Well, when do you
plan on getting it?

26:22.705 --> 26:23.687
When they're done.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.282
Damn it, this place
is a pigsty.

26:26.353 --> 26:27.761
You're the one
who said no janitors.

26:27.825 --> 26:29.200
Oh, thanks, Olivia.
It's my fault.

26:29.265 --> 26:30.346
I'm...
Pay dirt.

26:30.418 --> 26:32.305
Crime lab report
from the liquor store.

26:32.370 --> 26:33.353
Latent?

26:33.426 --> 26:36.907
I got the LUDs from the pay
phone. A 911 at 8:02 p. m.

26:36.978 --> 26:40.077
Prior to that, a 10-second
local call at 7:53 p. m...

26:40.147 --> 26:41.260
to Mr. Saul Garner.

26:41.331 --> 26:43.054
Let's go
wake him up.

26:43.699 --> 26:46.732
It's 5:00 in the a. m.
What is this all about?

26:46.804 --> 26:50.601
A phone call you got Monday
night, 7:53 in the p. m.

26:50.867 --> 26:53.453
Monday? Wasn't home.

26:56.853 --> 26:59.668
You look like you slept on
a sewer grate last night.

26:59.733 --> 27:00.977
Where were you Monday?

27:01.046 --> 27:02.387
On a date.

27:03.158 --> 27:05.361
Yeah, we're gonna have to
have the lucky girl's name.

27:05.429 --> 27:08.146
Why? I'm telling you,
I didn't get no call.

27:08.439 --> 27:11.189
Lasted about 10 seconds. Just,
like, long enough to get a message.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.662
Ten seconds?

27:12.727 --> 27:15.826
Maybe it was a wrong number, or
my girlfriend checking up on me.

27:15.895 --> 27:19.922
Either way, I wasn't home.
Nobody left a message. I swear.

27:23.863 --> 27:25.904
I take it
the papers hit the stands.

27:25.976 --> 27:27.122
Detective Tutuola.

27:27.192 --> 27:29.779
Would you hold on one second? Put
down the paper. Pick up a phone.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.823
The whacko on line one
or the psychotic on line two?

27:31.897 --> 27:33.720
Don't joke. The next
tip could break the case.

27:33.785 --> 27:36.021
Thank you. Well, that was
the psychic from California...

27:36.090 --> 27:37.268
who didn't say
anything much...

27:37.338 --> 27:39.607
about the killings, but did
predict that half of Manhattan...

27:39.674 --> 27:41.584
would slip into the river
tomorrow. Earthquake.

27:41.657 --> 27:43.033
You four,
put down the phones.

27:43.130 --> 27:44.374
What do you got?

27:44.442 --> 27:47.060
Crime lab ran the DNA on
Sophie through the data bank.

27:47.131 --> 27:48.210
We got a cold hit.

27:48.282 --> 27:49.940
How? We don't have DNA
from the other cases.

27:50.010 --> 27:53.307
This sample is from
another body five years ago.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.582
Sixth victim.

27:54.651 --> 27:57.270
Bonnie Weathers, a 10-year-old
from Queens, Howard Beach section.

27:57.339 --> 27:59.707
Raped, strangled, and dumped. River?

27:59.772 --> 28:01.267
Abandoned warehouse.

28:01.340 --> 28:04.407
Before he wised up and moved to the
water. That's why we got the DNA.

28:04.477 --> 28:06.867
Corn candy.
If this was his first.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.184
They usually start
close to home.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.397
In their safety zone.

28:09.469 --> 28:10.779
First one's always
the sloppiest.

28:10.846 --> 28:13.431
Let's re-interview everybody,
starting with the cops who caught it.

28:13.502 --> 28:15.127
I already talked
to their captain.

28:15.199 --> 28:16.181
You want us to go
to Queens?

28:16.254 --> 28:18.164
I live in Queens. You know
how long it'll take us?

28:18.237 --> 28:21.085
Not as long as it's gonna take
them to get their asses down here.

28:21.151 --> 28:22.461
Good point.

28:23.807 --> 28:25.530
Damn it,
it's the twins' birthday.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.126
I never picked up
their present.

28:27.199 --> 28:29.338
Well, I think
you have an excuse.

28:29.408 --> 28:33.401
Yeah, you come talk to me after
you cancel on Michael again tonight.

28:37.504 --> 28:39.064
Tatum and Becker?

28:41.601 --> 28:43.357
Did you hear something,
Becker?

28:43.425 --> 28:45.498
Yeah, now you
mention it, I do.

28:45.570 --> 28:47.937
Sounds like something
going right over your head.

28:48.002 --> 28:50.489
Look, pulling the case file,
that was a boss-to-boss thing.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.286
That's not how
I and my partner operate.

28:52.354 --> 28:55.835
But we're here now because we know
the important stuff is not in the file.

28:55.906 --> 28:57.433
You're right.
It's in our heads...

28:57.507 --> 29:00.823
and we're just too lazy
to go out, pick the guy up.

29:02.884 --> 29:04.444
I know that
we're on your turf...

29:04.515 --> 29:06.174
and I would be prickly
about it, too.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.699
That's why I had every
intention of coming in here...

29:08.772 --> 29:11.161
and schmoozing and kissing
a little ass.

29:11.236 --> 29:13.856
But we have got a ticking
clock, do you understand?

29:17.221 --> 29:20.386
Now, my partner and I have been on
this case for three days straight...

29:20.454 --> 29:22.396
and we're too damned tired
to get in a pissing match...

29:22.470 --> 29:25.786
so I just need to know if
you're gonna help us or not.

29:27.335 --> 29:29.310
What do you want to know?

29:30.278 --> 29:32.286
You interviewed over 200
people in the Weathers case.

29:32.359 --> 29:36.134
We don't have time to re-interview
them all. Give us a shortcut.

29:37.927 --> 29:40.131
Who'd you like?
Nobody good enough.

29:40.232 --> 29:42.338
Okay, at this point,
we'll take anyone.

29:42.408 --> 29:46.021
Just your creepy average guys who
happened to be in the vicinity.

29:46.089 --> 29:49.155
Janitor at the school.
His name was Phil Dartman.

29:52.298 --> 29:54.369
Did he have bad teeth?
No.

29:54.442 --> 29:57.890
But the guy who lived down
the street did, Clayton Mills.

29:58.122 --> 30:00.228
If you're looking for
somebody with bad teeth...

30:00.298 --> 30:03.016
my money's on this guy,
Joe Hayes.

30:03.306 --> 30:05.030
He was dating the babysitter
at the time.

30:05.099 --> 30:06.921
Did a stint in Attica.
Assault.

30:10.922 --> 30:12.200
Good luck.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.641
Joe Hayes?

30:18.733 --> 30:19.681
Who's asking?

30:19.757 --> 30:22.506
Detective Tutuola and Munch.
Do you own a white van?

30:22.573 --> 30:23.556
No.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.049
But I know
what this is about.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.981
Really? Illuminate us.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.816
You think I killed those girls on
account of that little Queens bitch.

30:31.886 --> 30:33.829
He's a sharp one.
Did you?

30:33.902 --> 30:37.318
I got the right to shut up if
I want to. I got work to do.

30:37.422 --> 30:40.870
Doesn't look good. An innocent
man would want to clear himself.

30:40.975 --> 30:43.823
I'm an ex-con.
I'm the one you go to first.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.775
I didn't rape no
grade-schooler five years ago...

30:45.840 --> 30:46.767
and I sure as hell...

30:46.832 --> 30:48.620
didn't do nobody now.

30:51.823 --> 30:53.897
It's Munch.
I need a 24-hour detail...

30:53.969 --> 30:56.141
on a guy we're sitting
on till they get here.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.631
Looking for a Mr. Mills.

30:59.697 --> 31:01.868
Sure, Clayton works here.
Why?

31:02.450 --> 31:03.627
Did he do
something wrong?

31:03.697 --> 31:05.072
No, we just want to
chat with him.

31:05.138 --> 31:06.633
Is he
a photographer?

31:06.706 --> 31:10.416
He's a wannabe. But he
doesn't really have it.

31:10.514 --> 31:11.888
Yet you still
keep him around.

31:11.956 --> 31:13.678
He's available
when I need him.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.405
Do you work with
the schools a lot?

31:15.475 --> 31:19.152
Yes. It's my bread and butter.
Keeps me busy year-round.

31:19.219 --> 31:21.161
Now, does Clayton come
with you to these shoots?

31:21.236 --> 31:24.138
You know, he does the lights,
he lugs the equipment. Why?

31:24.212 --> 31:27.758
That background look familiar
to you? Is this one of yours?

31:28.596 --> 31:30.384
Yeah.
Clayton working today?

31:30.484 --> 31:31.695
No, he called in sick.

31:31.765 --> 31:35.792
Okay. Is this a current address for him?

31:36.150 --> 31:39.761
Yeah. He rents a room
from an old woman.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.067
He used the schools
as a hunting ground.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.563
Mrs. Rapoport.

31:45.590 --> 31:46.900
Go, go, go.

32:12.378 --> 32:13.326
Nobody.

32:13.402 --> 32:14.579
You guys?

32:14.650 --> 32:15.860
We're clear.
Nothing up there.

32:16.730 --> 32:18.290
Well, well, well.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.180
Kirsten.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.682
Today's paper.

32:22.747 --> 32:23.925
Look.

32:25.371 --> 32:26.833
We're too late.

32:30.043 --> 32:31.702
Say hello
to Mrs. Rapoport.

32:31.772 --> 32:33.430
She must have
walked in on him.

32:33.501 --> 32:36.250
I guess Clayton
doesn't like surprises.

32:40.381 --> 32:42.520
The neighbor said
the landlady took a junket...

32:42.589 --> 32:43.997
to Atlantic City last Friday.

32:44.061 --> 32:45.271
The day Sophie was taken.

32:45.342 --> 32:47.131
It was supposed to be
a four-day stint.

32:47.198 --> 32:49.140
She lost all of her money,
so she came back a day early.

32:49.214 --> 32:51.669
The neighbor said that she
does this few times a year.

32:51.743 --> 32:53.303
We thinking these the times
the guy struck?

32:53.375 --> 32:55.230
It's the only time he
has the run of the house.

32:55.295 --> 32:58.611
She's got four hours left to live. We
gotta track down family and friends...

32:58.688 --> 33:00.629
Elliot, she's already dead.

33:00.927 --> 33:03.862
This guy is on the run. You think
that he's sticking to a time-clock?

33:03.936 --> 33:05.943
We proceed under the
assumption she's still alive.

33:06.016 --> 33:06.966
You know that.

33:07.039 --> 33:09.113
Proceed? What are we gonna
proceed to? What are we gonna do?

33:09.185 --> 33:11.094
Get a few minutes of
rack time, both of you.

33:11.169 --> 33:12.991
Take a nap. I'll let you
know how it turns out.

33:13.056 --> 33:14.039
Screw you.
Screw you.

33:14.112 --> 33:15.323
Now, that's enough,
both of you.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.920
You got out
and get some fresh air.

33:16.992 --> 33:19.295
Elliot, you talk to your wife. What?

33:24.322 --> 33:25.947
How old are you guys
again today? Five?

33:26.019 --> 33:27.001
Eight.

33:27.075 --> 33:28.863
Eight? No, you're not.
You're eight?

33:28.930 --> 33:29.978
You know something?

33:30.052 --> 33:32.090
I think Uncle Munchie has
some pudding cups under the...

33:32.163 --> 33:33.886
Yeah, you know
where the pudding cups are.

33:33.956 --> 33:35.778
Hi.
Hi, baby.

33:36.676 --> 33:38.748
I'm so sorry, Kath.
I got, like, two seconds.

33:38.819 --> 33:41.024
We'll take them.

33:41.924 --> 33:43.834
Did you get the...
Yeah. They're taken care of.

33:43.909 --> 33:44.989
Good.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.881
It's fuzzy and black.

33:47.973 --> 33:52.228
It is fuzzy and black. I don't
think I have anything for you guys.

33:52.294 --> 33:54.082
Bought you a present.

33:56.517 --> 33:59.201
This is the best present
a guy's ever had. Thank you.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.059
Elliot.
Got something.

34:02.086 --> 34:04.737
Okay, I love you. Bye.
Bye-bye.

34:07.591 --> 34:09.248
Fin just called in.
Okay.

34:09.895 --> 34:10.975
Remember Saul?
Saul...

34:11.049 --> 34:12.958
Last call from the pay phone
where Kirsten was grabbed.

34:13.032 --> 34:15.235
Guy said he wasn't home, had
no idea who it could've been.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.370
Munch and Fin paid a return
visit to his pawnshop.

34:18.728 --> 34:20.616
Clayton needs to flee
and he needs traveling money.

34:20.681 --> 34:24.030
Took a little arm-twisting, but he finally
admitted that Clayton called him back.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.632
Okay, so Clayton's
going to the pawnshop.

34:25.706 --> 34:29.022
He's afraid to drive into New York City.
He wants Saul to meet him in Brooklyn.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.373
Beautiful.

34:35.147 --> 34:36.739
The van is clear.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.525
Delta 1 in position.
Delta 2 set.

34:40.362 --> 34:41.824
We're all set.

34:45.643 --> 34:46.659
We're good down here.

34:46.732 --> 34:48.007
Copy that.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.333
What's he unloading,
Barbie dolls?

34:51.404 --> 34:55.233
Some old broad's got an attic full of
antiques and jewelry he sells for her.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.098
The landlady
he bludgeoned to death.

34:57.165 --> 35:01.923
Furthest stretch, I considered
he might be a thief.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.909
But a kid-raping killer?
Not a clue.

35:04.974 --> 35:06.949
You do anything to tip him
off, you're going down...

35:07.022 --> 35:08.429
as a kid-raping accomplice.
Got me?

35:08.495 --> 35:10.634
What if he shoots me?
I'll live.

35:10.702 --> 35:14.958
He's not going to shoot you. Every
sharpshooter in the city is out there.

35:15.182 --> 35:18.216
I don't see anyone. Every
building, every roof.

35:23.823 --> 35:26.922
He's here. Don't talk.
Don't look down at me.

35:26.993 --> 35:29.000
He's getting closer.
Saul.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.338
Why aren't they
stopping him?

35:31.408 --> 35:33.318
They need a few seconds
to close off the rear flank.

35:33.394 --> 35:35.335
If he sees you talking,
he's gonna know it's a setup.

35:35.410 --> 35:36.392
He's almost here.

35:36.465 --> 35:37.513
Damn it, Munch,
shut him up.

35:37.586 --> 35:39.276
Damn it, Saul.
Don't talk.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.095
If your lips keep moving,
I'll kill you myself.

35:42.161 --> 35:43.209
Saul.

35:44.338 --> 35:45.996
Bring it over here.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.860
Freeze! Police! Right there!

36:10.933 --> 36:13.835
Let me see your hands! Both
hands out of the car, now!

36:16.694 --> 36:17.871
Come on.

36:19.799 --> 36:23.095
Clayton Mills, do not move.
You're under arrest.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.976
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:25.047 --> 36:28.278
Kirsten? Honey?

36:41.786 --> 36:43.379
It's okay.

36:46.041 --> 36:48.530
It's okay.
It's all over.

36:48.793 --> 36:51.577
We're going home.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.970
My client would like to
discuss the terms of a deal.

37:03.035 --> 37:04.978
Your client rapes
and kills children.

37:05.051 --> 37:08.019
The only deal he's getting
is a free last meal.

37:08.892 --> 37:13.115
My client has disclosed to me
that at some point in the past...

37:13.629 --> 37:17.110
he took the life of a young
girl and disposed of the body.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.226
We already know that,
Mr. Mills.

37:19.293 --> 37:22.293
In fact, we know about all
four of the girls you killed.

37:23.998 --> 37:25.045
Five.

37:27.006 --> 37:31.099
Apparently there's a fifth victim
whose body has never been recovered.

37:33.631 --> 37:37.210
Four bodies puts a needle in
your arm. I don't need a fifth.

37:38.208 --> 37:40.925
I bet the mother
would like some closure.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.650
Tell me the girl's name.

37:46.721 --> 37:48.128
That he won't tell me.

37:48.193 --> 37:49.851
She was my first.

37:52.514 --> 37:54.456
A perfect little princess.

37:56.225 --> 37:57.818
Sweet as can be.

37:59.713 --> 38:01.274
Give me her name.

38:02.498 --> 38:04.887
Take the death penalty
off of the table...

38:06.755 --> 38:09.210
and I'll shout it
from the rooftops.

38:15.365 --> 38:17.470
I need you
to authorize this deal.

38:17.540 --> 38:20.258
Counselor,
I am a public servant.

38:20.325 --> 38:22.911
And the public
at large does not want...

38:22.982 --> 38:27.455
this boil on the butt of
humanity living to a ripe old age.

38:27.526 --> 38:29.795
Charlie, think of the mother.
I am.

38:29.862 --> 38:32.732
And I'm sure that she'd
want to see him die. Maybe.

38:32.807 --> 38:35.458
But she probably wants to know
what happened to her daughter, also.

38:35.527 --> 38:39.171
What about the mothers of all his
other victims? They want him dead.

38:39.238 --> 38:40.831
The city wants him dead.

38:40.903 --> 38:44.897
Even protestors against the death
penalty want to see this guy dead.

38:45.768 --> 38:48.638
You don't know all of the
other mothers want him dead.

38:48.713 --> 38:50.306
Of course they do.

38:55.177 --> 38:56.606
Mrs. Douglas.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.982
This is Sophie Douglas' mother.

39:03.627 --> 39:05.797
One of
Clayton Mills' victims.

39:06.698 --> 39:10.441
Mrs. Douglas.
I am truly sorry...

39:10.986 --> 39:12.929
about what
Sophie endured.

39:15.852 --> 39:18.666
Thankfully,
she did escape with her life.

39:19.948 --> 39:23.178
What do you think should
happen to him, Mrs. Douglas?

39:23.852 --> 39:25.128
He raped her.

39:26.892 --> 39:29.162
And he killed
her childhood.

39:31.213 --> 39:32.773
I want him dead.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.989
Look, it's more unbearable
than you can ever imagine.

39:39.310 --> 39:42.125
I cried every second
that Sophie was missing.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.483
I wanted to crawl out of
my skin.

39:46.030 --> 39:50.286
Sometimes I didn't realize that I'd
be screaming at the top of my lungs.

39:51.151 --> 39:54.348
I mean, not knowing for
three days nearly killed me.

39:55.216 --> 39:59.373
I can't imagine this poor woman
going through that for years.

40:00.433 --> 40:03.498
And letting it go on
for the rest of her life?

40:04.978 --> 40:06.538
I mean,
I want him dead...

40:06.609 --> 40:09.959
but you've gotta
help this woman.

40:33.268 --> 40:34.676
Get him away.

41:02.999 --> 41:05.488
Mrs. Lehr?
Yes.
