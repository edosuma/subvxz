01:08.606 --> 01:11.276
THANK YOU
A THOUSAND FOLD,
TURTLES.

01:11.277 --> 01:12.612
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR YOUR HELP,

01:12.613 --> 01:15.515
MY PRECIOUS DRAGON WOULD
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

01:15.516 --> 01:17.451
OBENTO, THERE IS ANOTHER

01:17.452 --> 01:19.488
WHO NEEDS
YOUR PROTECTION,

01:19.489 --> 01:22.392
USAGI YOJIMBO,
A STRANGER FROM
ANOTHER DIMENSION

01:22.393 --> 01:23.895
STRANDED IN OUR WORLD.

01:23.896 --> 01:25.898
I WILL GLADLY
CARE FOR HIM

01:25.899 --> 01:28.901
UNTIL YOU CAN
FIND A WAY OF
GETTING HIM HOME.

01:28.902 --> 01:32.005
IT'S THAT
BLASTED RABBIT AGAIN.

01:32.006 --> 01:35.811
WATCHING RERUNS OF YOUR
OLD FAILURES, SHREDDER?

01:35.812 --> 01:37.680
FAR FROM IT, KRANG.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.284
I AM PLOTTING
FUTURE VICTORIES,

01:40.285 --> 01:42.587
AND THIS
FURRY LITTLE
SAMURAI WARRIOR

01:42.588 --> 01:44.290
WILL HELP ME
ACHIEVE IT.

01:44.291 --> 01:47.762
EXACTLY HOW DO YOU
INTEND DOING THAT?

01:47.763 --> 01:52.135
BY TURNING HIM
INTO AN ALLY
AGAINST THE TURTLES.

01:59.613 --> 02:01.948
OH, PERFECT.

02:01.949 --> 02:05.120
A COMPLETELY
ABANDONED WAREHOUSE.

02:05.121 --> 02:06.789
OH, FOR ONCE
YOU TWO IMBECILES

02:06.790 --> 02:08.859
DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.266
OH, I HAD TO OPEN
MY BIG MOUTH.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.436
IT WAS HIS FAULT.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.938
IT WAS NOT!

02:17.939 --> 02:19.007
YEAH.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.307
OH, SHUT UP,
YOU TWO!

02:20.308 --> 02:22.044
THERE'S WORK
TO BE DONE.

02:23.548 --> 02:25.016
USAGI, MY SON,

02:25.017 --> 02:26.183
YOU WILL BE IN CHARGE

02:26.184 --> 02:28.654
WHILE I GO TO THE STORE
FOR SOME SUPPLIES.

02:28.655 --> 02:30.423
<i>HAI, OBENTO-SAN,</i>

02:30.424 --> 02:33.794
I WILL DEFEND THE MUSEUM
WITH MY LIFE.

02:33.795 --> 02:36.532
I DOUBT IF THAT
WILL BE NECESSARY.

02:38.001 --> 02:40.837
THERE, THAT'S
THE MAN WE WANT.

02:40.838 --> 02:42.373
A MAN?

02:42.374 --> 02:43.508
BUT BOSS...

02:43.509 --> 02:46.713
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING
TO GRAB THAT BUNNY.

02:46.714 --> 02:49.583
YOU ZEROS
WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE

02:49.584 --> 02:51.486
AGAINST THAT
SAMURAI RABBIT.

02:51.487 --> 02:53.556
ON THE OTHER HAND,

02:53.557 --> 02:55.192
<i>IF WE CAPTURE
HIS SENSEI,</i>

02:55.193 --> 02:57.762
HE WILL COME TO US.

02:58.932 --> 03:01.468
BIRDSEED,
SQUEAK TOYS, CATNIP,

03:01.469 --> 03:04.272
AND 20 POUNDS
OF CARROTS FOR USAGI.

03:04.273 --> 03:06.208
I HOPE THIS WILL
LAST US ALL FOR A WEEK.

03:07.611 --> 03:10.782
HEY, POP,
DID YOU HAVE
A NICE TRIP?

03:10.783 --> 03:13.619
INSOLENT YOUNG MAN,
WHO ARE YOU,

03:13.620 --> 03:15.688
OR RATHER, WHAT ARE YOU?

03:15.689 --> 03:18.726
DON'T TRY NOTHING
FUNNY, GEEZER.

03:18.727 --> 03:20.929
TAKE HIM
TO THE WAREHOUSE,

03:20.930 --> 03:24.301
THEN MEET ME AT THE
FAR EAST ANIMAL SOCIETY.

03:24.302 --> 03:26.303
TAKE A BREAK, DUDE.

03:26.304 --> 03:28.372
IT'S PIZZA TIME.

03:28.373 --> 03:30.309
NOT FOR ME.
I'M WORKING.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.312
TOO BUSY FOR PIZZA?

03:32.313 --> 03:35.116
OH, THE BOY IS
DEFINITELY OUT OF IT.

03:35.117 --> 03:36.251
I'M TOO BUSY TO EAT.

03:36.252 --> 03:38.021
I'M TRYING TO ZERO IN

03:38.022 --> 03:40.257
ON THAT DIMENSION
USAGI CAME FROM.

03:40.258 --> 03:43.094
HEY, NO PROBLEMO.
JUST FIND THE DIMENSION

03:43.095 --> 03:45.164
WHERE EVERYONE
LOOKS LIKE AN ANIMAL.

03:45.165 --> 03:47.935
ONLY DON'T TUNE IN
A WRESTLING MATCH
BY MISTAKE.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.102
HOLD ON!

03:49.103 --> 03:51.072
I THINK I'M GETTING
SOMETHING.

03:55.546 --> 03:57.548
<i>EEBA MATTER WITH YOO?</i>

03:57.549 --> 03:59.551
<i>YAH? WEE YOOYOO EEKIN?</i>

03:59.552 --> 04:02.990
IT'S THE PLANET
OF THE RUBBER BANDS.

04:02.991 --> 04:04.892
I THINK I SAW
THAT FLICK.

04:04.893 --> 04:07.563
HEY, SEE WHAT'S
ON ANOTHER CHANNEL.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.567
VENDING MACHINES?

04:10.568 --> 04:12.136
NOT QUITE.

04:12.137 --> 04:14.473
THE ENTIRE PLANET
IS JUNK FOOD.

04:14.474 --> 04:17.878
OH, TOTALLY RADICAL.

04:17.879 --> 04:21.349
MAYBE,
BUT IT'S STILL NOT
USAGI'S HOME WORLD.

04:21.350 --> 04:24.421
GUYS, THIS IS NOT
GOING TO BE EASY.

04:24.422 --> 04:27.424
HERE YOU ARE,
MY LITTLE FRIENDS.

04:27.425 --> 04:28.993
THESE BREADCRUMBS
WILL HAVE TO DO

04:28.994 --> 04:30.863
UNTIL MASTER OBENTO
RETURNS WITH THE SUPPLIES.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.067
THAT MUST BE HIM NOW.

04:34.068 --> 04:35.903
I WILL OPEN IT, MASTER.

04:37.105 --> 04:38.507
YOU!

04:38.508 --> 04:41.378
ARE YOU NOT THE ONE
THEY CALL SHREDDER?

04:41.379 --> 04:43.714
I HAVE THAT
EXTREME PLEASURE.

04:43.715 --> 04:46.018
BUT YOU ARE
A BAD PERSON.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.890
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I MADE YOUR MASTER
MY PRISONER.

04:49.891 --> 04:51.726
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH HIM?

04:51.727 --> 04:53.862
HE'S QUITE SAFE,
I ASSURE YOU.

04:53.863 --> 04:55.899
AND HE WILL REMAIN THAT WAY

04:55.900 --> 04:59.237
IF YOU CARRY OUT
A SMALL TASK FOR ME.

04:59.238 --> 05:00.873
WHAT TASK?

05:00.874 --> 05:04.879
DESTROY THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.882
NEVER!
TO TAKE 4 LIVES

05:06.883 --> 05:10.419
IN EXCHANGE FOR ONE
IS DISHONORABLE.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.390
PERHAPS I MIGHT SUGGEST
A MORE...

05:13.391 --> 05:15.159
HONORABLE ARRANGEMENT.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.629
SUCH AS?

05:16.630 --> 05:18.232
WE WILL FIGHT A DUEL.

05:18.233 --> 05:21.068
IF YOU WIN,
THE OLD MAN GOES FREE.

05:21.069 --> 05:25.074
BUT IF I WIN, YOU WILL
DESTROY THE TURTLES.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.576
I ACCEPT,

05:26.577 --> 05:30.482
ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOU CANNOT
POSSIBLY DEFEAT ME.

05:30.483 --> 05:32.485
WE SHALL SEE, RABBIT.

05:38.427 --> 05:41.431
OOH, OOH, 2 SWORDS
CLANKING TOGETHER.

05:41.432 --> 05:42.766
THAT'S OUR CUE.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.535
DIRTY TRICKS.

05:44.536 --> 05:47.273
IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR.

05:51.446 --> 05:53.081
NOW, MY FURRY FOE,

05:53.082 --> 05:54.984
PREPARE TO BE HUMILIATED.

05:54.985 --> 05:56.519
I SHOULD WARN YOU,

05:56.520 --> 05:58.656
I HAVE NEVER LOST
A SWORD FIGHT.

05:58.657 --> 06:00.892
THAT IS BECAUSE
YOU HAVE NEVER BEFORE

06:00.893 --> 06:02.995
FOUGHT A SAMURAI RABBIT.

06:09.206 --> 06:10.572
BLASTED CARPET!

06:10.573 --> 06:12.542
YOU TRICKED ME!

06:12.543 --> 06:16.215
SURRENDER OR TASTE
SAMURAI STEEL.

06:16.216 --> 06:18.551
BOMBS AWAY, BUDDY.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.888
WHAT'S THIS?

06:20.889 --> 06:22.656
WHAT MANNER OF BEAST

06:22.657 --> 06:24.659
IS TRYING TO DEVOUR ME?

06:30.503 --> 06:32.505
TREACHEROUS COWARD!

06:37.445 --> 06:39.714
THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.085
WHAT?

06:45.224 --> 06:48.561
YOU HAVE LOST,
MY LONG-EARED FRIEND.

06:48.562 --> 06:51.699
NOW, YOU MUST KEEP
YOUR PART OF THE BARGAIN

06:51.700 --> 06:54.103
AND DESTROY THE TURTLES.

06:54.104 --> 06:57.740
YOU ARE RIGHT.
I AM HONOR-BOUND.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.483
I GIVE UP, GUYS.

07:04.484 --> 07:07.387
THERE'S A JILLION OTHER
DIMENSIONS OUT THERE.

07:07.388 --> 07:09.057
I'M NEVER GONNA
FIND USAGI'S

07:09.058 --> 07:11.460
WITHOUT HIM HERE
TO HELP ME.

07:11.461 --> 07:14.799
WHICH MEANS WE'VE
GOTTA GO TO OBENTO'S
AND GET HIM.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.269
WHICH MEANS
DISGUISE TIME.

07:20.341 --> 07:22.876
UH, THESE GETUPS ARE
ALL RIGHT FOR THE STREET,

07:22.877 --> 07:24.412
BUT IF ANYONE
SPOTS US DOWN HERE,

07:24.413 --> 07:26.415
WE'RE GONNA LOOK
A LITTLE STRANGE.

07:26.416 --> 07:27.683
RELAX, DONATELLO.

07:27.684 --> 07:29.986
WHO'S GONNA SEE US
DOWN HERE?

07:29.987 --> 07:31.856
I CANNOT DO THIS.

07:31.857 --> 07:34.827
THEY ARE MY GOOD FRIENDS
WHO TRUST ME,

07:34.828 --> 07:36.929
YET I MUST.

07:36.930 --> 07:39.601
MY SAMURAI HONOR
DEMANDS IT.

07:41.371 --> 07:42.872
WHAT...

07:42.873 --> 07:44.141
USAGI!

07:44.142 --> 07:45.409
HEY, LITTLE DUDE,

07:45.410 --> 07:47.412
WE WERE JUST COMING
TO VISIT YOU.

07:48.949 --> 07:50.282
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

07:50.283 --> 07:53.688
HE ISN'T REAL GLAD
TO SEE US?

07:58.362 --> 07:59.796
YO, USAGI,

07:59.797 --> 08:01.666
IT'S US,
LITTLE BUDDY.

08:01.667 --> 08:04.570
WHY ARE YOU WAVING
YOUR SWORD AT US
LIKE THAT?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.472
I AM SORRY, MY FRIENDS.

08:06.473 --> 08:09.578
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO.

08:16.188 --> 08:17.655
IS IT JUST ME,

08:17.656 --> 08:19.491
OR DOES USAGI
SEEM TO HAVE

08:19.492 --> 08:21.228
A HATE ON FOR US?

08:21.229 --> 08:23.731
THE DUDE HAS
FULLY FREAKED OUT.

08:23.732 --> 08:25.800
YES, BUT WHY?

08:25.801 --> 08:26.835
WHO KNOWS?

08:26.836 --> 08:28.705
WE CAN'T GET NEAR ENOUGH
TO ASK HIM.

08:28.706 --> 08:32.275
LISTEN, USAGI,
IF THIS IS YOUR
IDEA OF A JOKE...

08:41.725 --> 08:45.462
USAGI, WHAT ON EARTH'S
GOTTEN INTO YOU?

08:45.463 --> 08:49.234
I AM SORRY. THIS
IS A MATTER OF HONOR.

08:51.538 --> 08:53.841
FROM HERE, IT LOOKS
LIKE A MATTER
OF SURVIVAL!

08:53.842 --> 08:55.877
QUICK, AFTER HIM!

08:55.878 --> 08:58.747
WHY? SO HE CAN TURN US
INTO TURTLE SASHIMI?

08:58.748 --> 09:00.050
NO, SO WE
CAN FIND OUT

09:00.051 --> 09:01.986
WHY HE'S ACTING
LIKE THIS.

09:09.664 --> 09:12.600
USAGI, WHAT'S COME
OVER YOU?

09:12.601 --> 09:15.272
<i>YEAH, WE'RE YOUR
COMPADRES, DUDE.</i>

09:15.273 --> 09:18.110
I MUST PUT AN END
TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

09:18.111 --> 09:19.812
AND TO YOU.

09:19.813 --> 09:22.615
THAT MIGHT NOT BE
AS EASY AS YOU THINK!

09:27.590 --> 09:29.092
WATCH OUT, USAGI.

09:29.093 --> 09:31.996
BE CAREFUL!
LOOK BOTH WAYS!

09:31.997 --> 09:34.533
HE'S HEADING
INTO THAT SHOPPING MALL.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.769
COME ON! AFTER HIM!

09:36.770 --> 09:38.939
AFTER HIM?
THE GUY'S TRYING TO SEND US

09:38.940 --> 09:41.076
TO THAT BIG
PET SHOP IN THE SKY!

09:41.077 --> 09:44.280
USAGI LIVES BY
A STRICT SAMURAI CODE.

09:44.281 --> 09:46.783
I SUSPECT SOMEONE IS
FORCING HIM TO DO THIS,

09:46.784 --> 09:49.320
AND WE'VE GOT
TO FIND OUT WHO!

09:56.399 --> 09:58.233
IS HE TIED SECURELY?

09:58.234 --> 10:01.471
OOH, THIS GUY AIN'T
GOING NOWHERES.

10:01.472 --> 10:03.474
NOTHING TO DO NOW

10:03.475 --> 10:06.478
BUT WAIT FOR THAT RABBIT
TO FINISH THE JOB.

10:06.479 --> 10:08.014
OH, BEBOP.

10:08.015 --> 10:10.484
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SUCH
A FAILURE IN LIFE.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.855
YOU LET OTHERS DO
YOUR WORK FOR YOU!

10:12.856 --> 10:15.592
WELL, GEE, YOU REALLY
THINK SO, BOSS?

10:15.593 --> 10:16.860
I KNOW SO!

10:16.861 --> 10:18.495
INSTEAD OF
LOAFING AROUND,

10:18.496 --> 10:21.266
YOU TWO THROWBACKS
SHOULD BE OUT
DOING THINGS.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.604
I GOT A IDEA, BOSS.

10:23.605 --> 10:26.608
WE'LL GO LOOK
FOR SOME FUEL.

10:26.609 --> 10:29.278
UH, YEAH! THEN WE CAN
BRING THE TECHNODROME

10:29.279 --> 10:31.448
UP TO THE SURFACE.

10:31.449 --> 10:33.184
GOOD THINKING!
GO OUT THERE

10:33.185 --> 10:35.087
AND STEAL EVERY
SOURCE OF FUEL

10:35.088 --> 10:37.624
YOU CAN LAY YOUR
UNWASHED HANDS ON.

10:37.625 --> 10:38.959
RIGHT, BOSS.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.295
FUEL, FUEL, FUEL!

10:41.296 --> 10:43.197
HAVING OTHERS
DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU...

10:43.198 --> 10:47.638
THAT'S WHAT BEING
THE BOSS IS ALL ABOUT.

10:50.576 --> 10:51.877
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO SCOPE HIM OUT

10:51.878 --> 10:53.746
IN ALL THIS TRAFFIC?

10:53.747 --> 10:55.549
SIMPLE.
JUST LOOK FOR
A GROUP OF PEOPLE

10:55.550 --> 10:57.251
WHO ARE SCREAMING
IN TERROR.

10:57.252 --> 10:59.788
THERE HE IS.
OVER THERE.

11:01.993 --> 11:02.993
THESE STAIRS...

11:02.994 --> 11:06.064
THEY HAVE A MIND
OF THEIR OWN.

11:11.205 --> 11:13.107
GOING DOWN!

11:15.378 --> 11:17.113
I HOPE THIS
IS ENOUGH.

11:17.114 --> 11:18.449
OOH, WELL, IT AIN'T.

11:18.450 --> 11:22.587
WE GOT TO GET
LOTS MORE ENERGY
FOR THE BOSS.

11:22.588 --> 11:25.625
GRAB THEM FLASHLIGHT
BATTERIES, BEBOP.

11:25.626 --> 11:27.127
HEY,
NO FREE SAMPLES!

11:27.128 --> 11:28.964
YOU GOTTA PAY
FOR THOSE!

11:28.965 --> 11:32.169
YEAH, SIT DOWN
AND HAVE A DRINK.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.990
THE EASTER BUNNY'S
GONE BERSERK!

11:46.991 --> 11:50.160
WILL YOU SIGN MY EGG,
MR. EASTER BUNNY?

11:50.161 --> 11:53.165
PERHAPS THERE IS HOPE
FOR THIS DIMENSION.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.569
THEIR YOUNG ARE EVOLVING
INTO A HIGHER LIFE FORM.

11:58.507 --> 12:01.611
LOOK SHARP, BUDS.
DIVE BOMBER AT 3 O'CLOCK!

12:04.416 --> 12:07.019
WHAT STRANGE MANNER
OF BIRD ARE THESE?

12:08.923 --> 12:10.156
WE GOTTA DO
SOMETHING.

12:10.157 --> 12:12.759
USAGI'S GONNA
TURN THIS PLACE
INTO A JUNKYARD.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.398
YEAH. WHERE'S HIS
HOLIDAY SPIRIT?

12:15.399 --> 12:17.667
MAYBE OBENTO
KNOWS WHAT'S
WRONG WITH HIM.

12:17.668 --> 12:19.069
GREAT, BUT WE'RE
NEVER GONNA GET

12:19.070 --> 12:20.738
TO THE FAR EAST
ANIMAL SOCIETY

12:20.739 --> 12:22.741
WITH THAT FREAKED OUT
FURBALL ON OUR TAILS.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.344
WE'VE GOT TO SEAL
HIM OFF SOMEHOW.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.714
I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

12:34.426 --> 12:36.294
NOW, RAPHAEL, MY FRIEND,

12:36.295 --> 12:38.797
<i>I MUST BID YOU SAYONARA.</i>

12:40.568 --> 12:42.368
OH, USAGI!

12:42.369 --> 12:44.405
I'M OVER HERE, DUDE.

12:44.406 --> 12:47.343
I'M ALSO HERE.

12:47.344 --> 12:48.678
NOT TO MENTION HERE

12:48.679 --> 12:50.448
AND HERE...AND HERE!

12:50.449 --> 12:53.285
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE ON TV.

12:53.286 --> 12:56.490
AAH! STAND STILL.

12:56.491 --> 13:00.328
STAND STILL. ONE
OF YOU MUST BE REAL.

13:00.329 --> 13:01.263
GOTCHA.

13:03.234 --> 13:04.734
IN YOU GO.

13:04.735 --> 13:07.038
ALL RIGHT,
DONATELLO, NOW!

13:09.242 --> 13:11.845
HE'LL BE LOST
IN THE SEWERS FOR HOURS.

13:11.846 --> 13:15.483
NOW LET'S HEAD
FOR THE ANIMAL SOCIETY.

13:15.484 --> 13:18.888
UH, YOU THINK
WE SWIPED ENOUGH
STUFF YET?

13:18.889 --> 13:20.924
HMM...NOPE.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.060
WE STILL NEED MORE.

13:22.061 --> 13:24.397
MORE POWER THAN THIS?

13:24.398 --> 13:26.266
HEY, YOU KNOW THE BOSS.

13:26.267 --> 13:28.034
HE'S POWER MAD.

13:28.035 --> 13:29.604
SO...

13:29.605 --> 13:32.041
HE WANTS LOTS
OF POWER, DOES HE?

13:36.648 --> 13:40.853
OK, MAC, I'LL DRIVE
FROM HERE ON.

13:40.854 --> 13:44.593
OK, FILL HER UP.

13:44.594 --> 13:46.595
A NEW BREAKTHROUGH
IN THE FIELD OF ENERGY

13:46.596 --> 13:49.466
WAS REVEALED TODAY WHEN
DR. RUFUS WINTERBOTTOM

13:49.467 --> 13:52.871
OF ACME RESEARCH
UNVEILED HIS NEWEST
DISCOVERY,

13:52.872 --> 13:54.140
A CHEMICAL ADDITIVE

13:54.141 --> 13:57.277
WHICH SUPERCHARGES
ORDINARY FUEL.

13:57.278 --> 14:01.250
YES, MISS O'NEIL.
A SINGLE DROP OF
MY SUPERCHARGER

14:01.251 --> 14:03.253
ADDED TO THIS
CAN OF GASOLINE

14:03.254 --> 14:04.320
WILL MAKE IT
POWERFUL ENOUGH

14:04.321 --> 14:07.559
TO FLY A JET
FROM HERE TO PARIS.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.565
OH, NOW, THAT'S SOMETHING
THE BOSS WOULD REALLY LIKE.

14:11.566 --> 14:14.502
COME ON, WE'RE GOING
TO PAY ACME RESEARCH

14:14.503 --> 14:16.205
A LITTLE VISIT.

14:22.147 --> 14:25.351
EXCUSE ME, BUT HAVE YOU
SEEN 4 TURTLES?

14:26.353 --> 14:27.621
I KEEP FORGETTING.

14:27.622 --> 14:30.992
NOT EVERY CREATURE
IN THIS STRANGE WORLD
CAN SPEAK.

14:30.993 --> 14:33.029
NO MATTER. THERE
ARE OTHER WAYS

14:33.030 --> 14:34.597
TO SNIFF THEM OUT.

14:40.307 --> 14:42.809
EH, WHAT'S UP, DOC?

14:42.810 --> 14:46.081
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

14:46.082 --> 14:49.319
OOH, HAND OVER
THAT FORMULA.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.555
NO, I REFUSE TO.

14:53.759 --> 14:58.365
OK, WISE GUY, WHICH
ONE'S THE SUPERCHARGER?

14:58.366 --> 15:00.001
I WON'T TELL.

15:00.002 --> 15:03.705
OK, THEN WE'LL JUST
TAKE ALL OF THEM.

15:05.009 --> 15:08.179
I DON'T GET THIS.
WHERE'S OBENTO?

15:08.180 --> 15:09.548
AND WHAT'S GONE ON
IN HERE?

15:09.549 --> 15:11.551
WHOA, THERE'S BEEN
A HUMONGOUS BATTLE,

15:11.552 --> 15:13.353
THAT'S FOR SURE.

15:13.354 --> 15:16.358
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE ARE SWORD
MARKS EVERYWHERE

15:16.359 --> 15:18.895
AS IF SOME SORT
OF A DUEL HAD
BEEN FOUGHT.

15:18.896 --> 15:21.732
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
THIS IS ABOUT?

15:21.733 --> 15:24.335
I DOUBT IF IT'S SOMEONE'S
GOOD-LUCK CHARM.

15:26.072 --> 15:29.777
NOW, MY FRIENDS,
YOU ARE FINISHED!

15:35.151 --> 15:36.453
FORGIVE ME, MY FRIENDS,

15:36.454 --> 15:40.892
BUT A RABBIT MUST DO
WHAT A RABBIT MUST DO.

15:40.893 --> 15:44.530
BUT LIKE, WHY
DOES A RABBIT
HAVE TO DO IT TO US?

15:44.531 --> 15:46.968
WE DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU, USAGI,

15:46.969 --> 15:48.803
BUT WE WILL STOP YOU.

15:48.804 --> 15:52.743
TRY IF YOU WISH,
BUT YOU WILL FAIL!

15:54.146 --> 15:58.050
USAGI,
WHAT'S BEHIND ALL THIS?

15:58.051 --> 15:59.986
NOW, TELL US.

15:59.987 --> 16:02.824
IT SHAMES ME TO SAY IT,

16:02.825 --> 16:06.596
BUT I LOST A DUEL
TO A MR. SHREDDER.

16:06.597 --> 16:07.799
SHREDDER?

16:08.867 --> 16:11.670
NOW THE PIECES ARE
FINALLY STARTING

16:11.671 --> 16:12.505
TO FALL INTO PLACE.

16:12.506 --> 16:14.674
WE'LL TIE YOU UP
IF WE HAVE TO,

16:14.675 --> 16:16.843
UNTIL YOU LISTEN
TO REASON!

16:16.844 --> 16:19.148
YOU WILL NOT!

16:25.791 --> 16:27.492
AGAIN?

16:27.493 --> 16:31.532
AGAIN? WAS THAT
HOW YOU LOST TO SHREDDER?

16:31.533 --> 16:34.502
YES, AS BEST
AS I RECALL.

16:34.503 --> 16:36.172
YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED.

16:36.173 --> 16:40.111
SEE? THAT HUGE MAGNET
PREVENTED YOU
FROM STRIKING.

16:44.919 --> 16:46.119
FORGIVE ME.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.857
I HAD HOPED TO DO
THE HONORABLE THING.

16:48.858 --> 16:50.626
YOU MEAN LIKE
WASTING US?

16:50.627 --> 16:54.398
AND YET, I REALIZE THAT
TO BETRAY ONE'S FRIENDS

16:54.399 --> 16:56.969
IS THE MOST
DISHONORABLE ACT OF ALL.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.872
HOW CAN I EVER
REDEEM MYSELF?

16:59.873 --> 17:01.575
I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:02.812 --> 17:05.314
WE'VE SEEN THIS
STUFF WORK, BOSS.
[SNORTS]

17:05.315 --> 17:08.251
AND IT'S LIKE SOME KIND
OF ENERGY BOOSTER.

17:08.252 --> 17:10.421
BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT
IF I CAN'T TELL

17:10.422 --> 17:14.227
WHICH BEAKER CONTAINS
THE SUPERCHARGER
COMPOUND?

17:14.228 --> 17:18.434
HEY, BOSS,
I THINK I FOUND IT.

17:18.435 --> 17:22.472
LOOK WHAT THIS STUFF
DOES TO MY TOY ROBOT.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.351
INCREDIBLE!

17:32.854 --> 17:34.856
OOH, WE BETTER
DO SOMETHING

17:34.857 --> 17:37.127
BEFORE IT
WRECKS THE JOINT.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.270
THERE, I DID SOMETHING.

17:44.271 --> 17:47.241
OUTSTANDING!
WITH THIS FORMULA,

17:47.242 --> 17:48.976
THAT TRUCKLOAD
OF GASOLINE
WILL BE SUFFICIENT

17:48.977 --> 17:52.048
TO REPOWER THE
ENTIRE TECHNODROME

17:52.049 --> 17:54.551
AND STAMP
THIS PLANET FLAT!

17:54.552 --> 17:57.021
QUICKLY!
WE MUST LOAD UP.

17:57.022 --> 17:59.926
I HAVE
CARRIED OUT
YOUR REQUEST.

17:59.927 --> 18:02.029
EXCELLENT. TAKE THEM
TO THE NEXT ROOM.

18:02.030 --> 18:04.332
I WILL DEAL WITH THEM
IN A MOMENT.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.570
BEBOP, ROCK STEADY,
BRING OUT THE OLD MAN.

18:10.175 --> 18:12.343
THERE. WHAT NOW?

18:12.344 --> 18:14.413
JUST GO OUT THERE
AND STALL THEM.

18:14.414 --> 18:16.849
THE PARTY STARTS
IN 30 SECONDS.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.186
VERY WELL.

18:18.187 --> 18:20.355
YO, DUDES,
CHECK IT OUT.

18:20.356 --> 18:22.825
BOY, ARE WE LUCKY OR WHAT?

18:22.826 --> 18:24.695
LET'S GET THESE
CRATES OPEN.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.697
I HAVE KEPT MY BARGAIN.

18:26.698 --> 18:28.700
NOW RELEASE OBENTO.

18:28.701 --> 18:31.871
RABBIT, YOU HAVE CARRIED
OUT MY ORDERS WELL.

18:31.872 --> 18:33.407
SO WELL IN FACT,

18:33.408 --> 18:36.546
THAT I THINK I'LL
KEEP YOU IN MY EMPLOY.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.615
BUT THAT WAS NOT
OUR AGREEMENT.

18:38.616 --> 18:42.286
USAGI YOJIMBO, SWEAR
ETERNAL LOYALTY TO ME,

18:42.287 --> 18:44.789
OR THE OLD MAN PERISHES.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.795
WHAT? NEVER!

18:47.796 --> 18:51.032
NOT SO FAST,
CARROT BREATH.

18:51.033 --> 18:52.835
I HOPE THIS THING WORKS.

18:56.173 --> 18:59.145
I WARN YOU.
DEFY ME,

18:59.146 --> 19:01.314
AND YOU WILL SHARE
THIS OLD MAN'S FATE.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.651
I WILL NEVER SERVE YOU!

19:03.652 --> 19:05.319
THEN SO BE IT.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.890
HOLD IT, SHRED MAN.

19:07.891 --> 19:09.159
THE TURTLES!

19:09.160 --> 19:11.328
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE!

19:11.329 --> 19:12.830
H-HEY, YOU SAID

19:12.831 --> 19:16.335
THE BUNNY WAS GOING
TO FINISH THEM OFF.

19:16.336 --> 19:20.875
THAT MEANS
THEY'RE G-G-G-GHOSTS!

19:20.876 --> 19:24.747
THEN THEY WON'T MIND
BEING OBLITERATED AGAIN.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.750
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.

19:26.751 --> 19:28.853
DONATELLO,
FIRE ONE!

19:31.791 --> 19:34.362
COWABUNGA, DUDES!

19:34.363 --> 19:36.931
NOW, THIS IS WHAT
I CALL A PARTY!

19:39.369 --> 19:43.541
OOH, IT'S WORLD WAR III
ALL OVER AGAIN!

19:43.542 --> 19:45.710
YOU BRAINLESS HULKS,

19:45.711 --> 19:47.813
THIS ISN'T
AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE.

19:47.814 --> 19:50.618
IT'S A FIREWORKS FACTORY!

19:50.619 --> 19:51.653
SO, USAGI,

19:51.654 --> 19:53.823
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR LITTLE TOWN?

19:53.824 --> 19:56.360
IT IS QUITE COLORFUL.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.930
WE MUST GET
THE FUEL SUPERCHARGER.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.233
FUEL SUPERCHARGER?

20:02.837 --> 20:05.206
CLUMSY ME.

20:08.845 --> 20:11.447
TURTLES,
SURRENDER AT ONCE,

20:11.448 --> 20:14.352
OR I'LL BLAST YOU ALL
TO REPTILIAN REMNANTS.

20:14.353 --> 20:16.455
I HATE TO TELL YOU
THIS, SHREDDER,

20:16.456 --> 20:18.859
<i>BUT THIS WAS
THE RIGHT VIAL.</i>

20:18.860 --> 20:21.362
THE FORMULA, WHAT
DID YOU DO WITH IT?

20:21.363 --> 20:24.033
YOU'LL FIND OUT
JUST ABOUT...

20:24.034 --> 20:26.036
NOW!

20:29.641 --> 20:32.712
HURRY! WE'LL
BE BLOWN TO BITS!

20:32.713 --> 20:35.349
THE VILLAINS
ARE ESCAPING!

20:35.350 --> 20:36.985
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.386
WE CAN'T BOTHER
WITH THEM.

20:38.387 --> 20:40.056
WE MUST GET OUT
OF HERE.

20:40.057 --> 20:41.859
WAIT! OBENTO!

20:42.994 --> 20:45.130
COME, MASTER.

20:45.131 --> 20:47.299
THIS STRUCTURE
IS NO LONGER SAFE.

20:49.938 --> 20:52.073
AFTER THIS,

20:52.074 --> 20:55.745
THE FOURTH OF JULY'S
GOING TO SEEM AWESOMELY
DULL.

20:55.746 --> 20:57.949
USAGI, I HOPE
YOU'VE LEARNED

20:57.950 --> 21:00.953
NEVER TO TRUST
THAT EVIL SHREDDER AGAIN.

21:00.954 --> 21:02.655
I HAVE, MY FRIENDS.

21:02.656 --> 21:04.992
AND I HOPE
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

21:04.993 --> 21:07.261
REMEMBER,
USAGI IS STILL
A STRANGER HERE,

21:07.262 --> 21:10.232
AND HAS MUCH
TO LEARN ABOUT
OUR WORLD.

21:11.068 --> 21:14.973
<i>AND HERE COMES
LESSON NUMERO UNO.</i>

21:14.974 --> 21:17.509
THANKS, DUDE.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.412
USAGI'S ABOUT
TO SAMPLE

21:19.413 --> 21:22.984
OUR WORLD'S MOST
TUBULOSO CUISINE.

21:22.985 --> 21:25.087
WHAT MANNER
OF THING IS THIS?

21:25.088 --> 21:28.292
IT'S CALLED PIZZA, DUDE.

21:28.293 --> 21:30.529
IS IT SAFE TO EAT?

21:30.530 --> 21:31.964
YEAH, BUT I'M WARNING YOU,

21:31.965 --> 21:33.365
IT'S HABIT-FORMING.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.705
YOU KNOW,

21:37.706 --> 21:39.374
I THINK I'M
GOING TO LIKE

21:39.375 --> 21:41.545
LIVING
IN THIS WORLD.
