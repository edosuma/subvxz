of the king suite, please?

For?

26:46.564 --> 26:49.852

26:50.234 --> 26:54.273
No charge at the door,
if that's what you're thinking.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.981

charge for an Indian practice.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.407

27:01.996 --> 27:03.657
You get the bar, sure,

27:03.748 --> 27:05.704
but I'm gonna need you
to clear some tables out,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.657
so my gang can do what they do.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.038
I lose tables, I lose drinkers.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.663

No, not since the cops
nearly beat him to death.

in New Orleans?

37:06.100 --> 37:08.762
Okay, so the source who gave me these,

37:08.977 --> 37:11.309
he said that they might have burned the body,

37:11.397 --> 37:12.477
just to prevent it from going ripe.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.727
But why hide the car in the bushes,
behind the levee?

37:15.818 --> 37:19.481
And you're quite sure you matched up that
with this autopsy report?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.983
What is it? Glover, Henry?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.905
Mmm-hmm.
Those are the only burned remains.

37:23.992 --> 37:27.655
And it lines up geographically
and by approximate date, yeah.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.493
-Wow.
-Mmm-hmm.

37:33.794 --> 37:36.410

If you want copies of any of those,
it's no problem.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.417
-Your case is...
-Joseph Abreu.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.752
But I have all the papenIvork.

37:45.514 --> 37:47.254
I brought the father down

37:47.349 --> 37:51.137
and used him to pry the last of the pages
out of the good doctor.

37:51.228 --> 37:52.217
(LAUGHS)

37:52.521 --> 37:56.230
Yeah, but you know, Iwouldn't mind
making copies of the rest of these.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.602
Who knows when I'll run into
one of these cases down the road, right?

37:58.694 --> 37:59.900
Right.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.031
So I saw your ad in the Louisiana Weekly.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.366
The name of that one cop,

38:08.454 --> 38:10.570
he's the one you think killed Abreu, huh?

38:10.664 --> 38:12.200
Maybe.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.165
I know he's involved in a hell of a lot more
than that.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.122
Yeah, but putting an ad
like that in a newspaper,

38:18.213 --> 38:20.329
letting the NOPD know what you're after?

38:20.799 --> 38:22.209
Well... (LAUGHS)

38:24.511 --> 38:25.921
(COPY MACHINE WHIRS)

38:27.723 --> 38:29.839

38:29.933 --> 38:31.264

38:31.351 --> 38:35.390
People like you and me, lawyers, reporters...

38:36.565 --> 38:39.978
The police are usually more bark than bite,

38:40.068 --> 38:43.276
but if we were black or brown

38:43.530 --> 38:45.486
or working-class white people, you know,

38:45.574 --> 38:48.316
just folks living around the way,

38:48.410 --> 38:52.744
unable to write it up or make it stick,

38:54.416 --> 38:57.829
now, then, I would worry.

38:58.212 --> 39:00.077
Mmm-hmm. Right.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.622
So I take it from the number of files here,

39:03.717 --> 39:05.673
you're gonna be
down with us for a while, huh?

My sons dumped me for teenage girls.

54:49.203 --> 54:51.535
Then we'll hang ourselves tomorrow.

54:52.832 --> 54:54.948
Unless Godot comes.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.373
And if he comes?

54:58.921 --> 55:00.422
We'll be saved.

55:03.176 --> 55:04.712
Motherfucker ain't coming.

55:06.429 --> 55:07.885
Excuse me?

55:09.974 --> 55:11.384
The man,

55:13.352 --> 55:14.637
he ain't coming.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.681
ESTRAGON: Well,

55:16.772 --> 55:18.763
shall we go?

55:18.858 --> 55:20.143
Pull on your trousers.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.269
What?

55:21.360 --> 55:22.611
Pull on your trousers.

55:22.695 --> 55:24.435
You want me to pull off my trousers?

55:24.572 --> 55:27.530
-Pull on your trousers.
-True.

55:28.534 --> 55:29.990
Shall we go?

55:31.078 --> 55:32.284
Yes.

55:32.997 --> 55:34.578
Let's go.

55:37.126 --> 55:40.539
SOFIA: When I read "Godot" in school,
I never imagined it like that.

55:40.630 --> 55:42.291
Out there, where the water came through,

55:42.381 --> 55:43.666
everything wrecked.

55:44.926 --> 55:45.961
You should have come.

55:46.052 --> 55:47.792
It's not my thing, really.

55:49.096 --> 55:51.303
So who you going to see?

55:51.390 --> 55:53.972
-Goatwhore.
-Goatwhore?

55:54.060 --> 55:56.472
You listen to much metal?

55:56.562 --> 56:00.555
Most of what I listen to
gets played on 78 RPM.

56:00.650 --> 56:03.938
If it's younger than 1937, it's suspect.

56:04.612 --> 56:06.568
How old are you, anyway?

56:06.906 --> 56:08.271
-27.
-Hmm.

56:08.533 --> 56:11.320
Yeah, but, like, I thought he was only like 24,

56:11.410 --> 56:15.369
and he thought I was 21,
so we're only three years apart, really.

56:15.456 --> 56:16.741
(CHUCKLES)

56:19.627 --> 56:21.242
Turn up here.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.415
-Turn here.
-Here?

56:43.818 --> 56:45.558
Take a left up here.

57:02.712 --> 57:05.875
All right, just pull over at this
gas station up here. Right under that light.
