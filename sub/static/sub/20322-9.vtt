WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:03.670
Would you look at this?

00:03.700 --> 00:04.740
After last night's dinner,

00:04.770 --> 00:06.068
we're officially in the black.

00:06.098 --> 00:07.980
Buddy, you're gonna be enjoying those

00:08.010 --> 00:10.200
Sunday morning eggs benedict
for years to come.

00:10.230 --> 00:11.299
Thank you very much.

00:11.329 --> 00:13.478
First time in 25 years living upstairs

00:13.508 --> 00:15.490
I've been able to get
a decent plate of eggs

00:15.520 --> 00:17.197
- with my Sunday horoscope.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

00:17.227 --> 00:20.635
- Marzanas wasn't that bad, Dad.
- Hmm! Marzanas,

00:20.873 --> 00:23.800
then the Greek place, then
it's empty for a year here,

00:23.830 --> 00:25.719
- a year there...
- God forbid we have to cross the street

00:25.720 --> 00:28.039
- for our Sunday breakfast.
- A day like today,

00:28.040 --> 00:30.730
I'd be like unpainted drywall.

00:30.930 --> 00:34.800
You mean... you'd have
to put on two coats.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.569
Dad's obsessed with word games.

00:36.599 --> 00:37.257
Ahh!

00:37.287 --> 00:40.090
And my little girl here has always
been up for playing them with me.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.649
Riddles, puns, tongue twisters.

00:42.679 --> 00:44.450
OK, don't scare Oz off,

00:44.480 --> 00:46.639
we might not be welcome
for Sunday brunch anymore.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.920
Fat chance of that happening.

00:47.950 --> 00:49.569
Believe me, you're preaching
to the converted.

00:49.570 --> 00:52.369
One time, I did a performance
that was all puns.

00:52.399 --> 00:54.509
- It was literally... a play on words.
- (Chuckling)

00:54.510 --> 00:56.449
A play on... I like this guy.

00:56.450 --> 00:57.919
- Yeah, he's funny.
- Would you like more coffee?

00:57.920 --> 01:01.194
I'd love to, but coach
can't be late for practice.

01:01.224 --> 01:03.810
We are one month away
from the Special Olympics

01:03.840 --> 01:05.990
and we are going all the way this year.

01:06.020 --> 01:09.040
That's my girl. Take no prisoners.

01:09.532 --> 01:11.370
Hey, you know, I'd love to see
a practice sometime.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.269
- You know, the team in action.
- Yeah! I'll send you a schedule.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.178
Great! And you know you
can come by here anytime,

01:17.208 --> 01:20.726
you know, just bring friends, or solo.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.269
Or come with friends, I guess.

01:23.270 --> 01:24.469
I'd like that.

01:27.710 --> 01:31.622
I raised Emma on my own,
son. Everything I've done,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.939
I've done for her. She's
not to be trifled with.

01:34.940 --> 01:38.050
I would not dare to incur the wrath
of Mr. Buddy Carver.

01:38.716 --> 01:40.898
Well, don't judge a book by its cover.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.570
I'm tougher than I look.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.705
I believe you.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.980
When you say stuff in that tone,
I definitely believe you.

01:48.589 --> 01:49.424
OK.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.550
I know what you're looking for,
and it's not here.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.430
Show yourself!

02:34.240 --> 02:37.555
(Thrilling music)

02:43.496 --> 02:45.098
(Two gun shots)

02:53.284 --> 02:56.062
You'll... never find it.

03:05.863 --> 03:09.920
(Opening music)

03:13.546 --> 03:16.285
So you didn't hear anything. No gunshots?

03:16.315 --> 03:19.340
No, I saw the police and EMS
and I went upstairs.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.760
Who'd do this?

03:22.050 --> 03:24.480
We just had breakfast.
Emma's gonna be devastated.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.600
Who's Emma?

03:26.120 --> 03:28.450
His daughter, the only family he had.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.270
Do you know where she is right now?

03:31.650 --> 03:33.960
Yeah, she coaches
Special Olympics athletes

03:33.990 --> 03:36.879
- at this gym downtown.
- Look, I gotta get going.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.570
Why don't you text me the address,
we'll meet you down there.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.880
- Hand in the visitor tag out-front.
- OK.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.530
Thanks...

03:43.560 --> 03:44.740
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:44.770 --> 03:45.719
Turns out someone went

03:45.720 --> 03:47.679
through the apartment
with a fine-tooth comb.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.299
They were definitely looking for something.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.160
So this is not random B&E gone sideways.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.209
As soon as I saw his photo,

03:52.210 --> 03:54.980
I thought he looked familiar,
and then I had Dev run the prints.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.280
And?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.579
And we get called in for a random homicide

03:58.580 --> 04:01.130
and the guy turns out to be Harvey Winters.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.659
Alright, who's Harvey Winters?

04:04.689 --> 04:07.380
In 1988, Harvey Winters

04:08.680 --> 04:12.520
and David Skinner and Reginald Clarkson

04:12.590 --> 04:15.389
all posed as New York Airport
grounds crew and stowed away

04:15.390 --> 04:17.909
on Tetra Flight 206 to San Francisco.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.418
They hijacked the plane over Nevada,

04:19.420 --> 04:21.300
forced the pilot to land
somewhere in the desert,

04:21.310 --> 04:23.363
and then made off with the secret cargo...

04:23.393 --> 04:27.860
over 5 million15th-century
Spanish gold doubloons.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.629
During the heist, Skinner shot Clarkson,

04:30.630 --> 04:32.019
left him for dead in the desert,

04:32.020 --> 04:35.190
but Clarkson survived and he's
currently serving time

04:35.220 --> 04:36.799
at Lompoc Penitentiary.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.991
So Harvey might've still
had some of this gold?

04:40.021 --> 04:41.679
Yeah, he and Skinner
made off with everything

04:41.680 --> 04:44.989
- and then they just disappeared.
- These guys are legends, OK?

04:44.990 --> 04:47.229
There's been dozens
of unconfirmed sightings,

04:47.230 --> 04:49.399
and crime buffs, they
make sites about them.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.600
Yeah, if this gets out,

04:51.030 --> 04:52.459
it's gonna be a circus around here.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.889
So the killers might have
made off with the gold coins.

04:54.890 --> 04:57.639
Well, Harvey managed to
elude capture for 25 years

04:57.640 --> 05:00.350
and I doubt he kept his stash
hidden under the mattress.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.729
So if he's the only one
who knew where the gold was,

05:02.730 --> 05:03.910
why kill him?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.689
I don't think that was part of the plan.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.160
Harvey tussled with the intruder.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.349
Might have killed him by accident.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.819
There's no fingerprints at the apartment

05:09.820 --> 05:11.760
that don't belong to
Harvey or his daughter.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.810
If we find that gold,

05:12.820 --> 05:14.840
I'm pretty sure the
killer won't be far behind.

05:15.230 --> 05:16.729
And if we're able to crack this case,

05:16.730 --> 05:18.019
we'll get to rub it in the face

05:18.020 --> 05:20.540
of every agency in the Western hemisphere.

05:20.790 --> 05:21.749
Until that happens,

05:21.750 --> 05:24.139
I'm putting a gag order
on Buddy's true identity.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.349
Less people know about this,

05:25.350 --> 05:26.979
less of a circus it becomes around here.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.470
I'm working with the penitentiary

05:28.480 --> 05:30.929
to try to get a video
call set up with Clarkson.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.190
He may be able to shed
new light on the case.

05:33.220 --> 05:34.500
I'll let you know when it's set up.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.360
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.150
- You're not?
- A little.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.510
Yeah. OK.

05:43.150 --> 05:45.870
<i>Oh, so close! OK, this time
run yourself up to the hoop.</i>

05:46.137 --> 05:49.400
Let's see, and... yes!

05:49.670 --> 05:51.830
Nice. One more time.
One more time, Justin.

05:53.530 --> 05:55.239
Nice! Yes! Justin for two,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.359
<i>- straight to the hoop!
- This is gonna kill her.</i>

05:58.360 --> 06:00.509
Well, if anyone can
break it to her lightly,

06:00.510 --> 06:03.020
<i>- it's you, Oz.
- Yes! Amazing!</i>

06:03.430 --> 06:04.470
Yeah, one more!

06:04.730 --> 06:08.210
- Would you prefer we talk to her?
- No, it's OK. I can do it.

06:08.378 --> 06:09.725
<i>- OK.
- Good,</i>

06:09.755 --> 06:12.660
<i>- OK, Buddy.
- good. Yes, OK. Pass, pass,</i>

06:12.690 --> 06:14.819
straight to the hoop... nice!

06:14.820 --> 06:17.179
- That was so close.
- Oz!

06:17.180 --> 06:18.709
- Don't let me throw you off there.
- Hey.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.940
I'm surprised you took
me up on my offer so soon!

06:21.910 --> 06:23.019
You really dialed it in there, huh?

06:23.020 --> 06:24.249
Justin's one of our stars.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.039
- I just let him play.
- Yeah, wait.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.049
Coach Carver always
busts me on my bad habits.

06:28.050 --> 06:30.099
That's because I know how good you can be,

06:30.100 --> 06:31.719
and 'cause you promised me a gold medal.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.760
No pressure, right? I can handle it.

06:34.547 --> 06:36.320
Mm, I like that. Eh eh eh.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.169
You really got 'em
playing like superstars.

06:41.170 --> 06:42.389
They're really putting in the effort.

06:42.390 --> 06:44.730
We're gonna be in great shape
for the Special Olympics.

06:46.624 --> 06:47.664
What is it?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.500
<i>Something wrong?</i>

06:52.160 --> 06:53.960
Emma, it's about your dad.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.870
Why would he lie to me his whole life?

07:02.768 --> 07:05.118
I think he was trying to protect you.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.484
Look...

07:06.858 --> 07:08.649
we think that whoever did this

07:08.650 --> 07:10.939
was trying to find
something in his apartment.

07:10.940 --> 07:14.660
Like what? My dad worked hard.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.109
He put me through college.

07:16.110 --> 07:18.250
He didn't own anything of value.

07:20.470 --> 07:22.580
He never mentioned Flight 206,

07:22.650 --> 07:24.910
- or doubloons?
- No!

07:25.233 --> 07:27.415
<i>Did he lie to me about everything?</i>

07:29.120 --> 07:33.028
My dad was Buddy Carver, OK?

07:33.058 --> 07:36.310
He... he didn't tell me about any of this.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.940
Did you notice anything unusual lately?

07:39.370 --> 07:41.259
Did he seem... worried,

07:41.260 --> 07:43.379
were there any strange
people hanging around?

07:43.409 --> 07:44.640
(Sniffling)

07:46.740 --> 07:49.216
<i>Ah, look who's here!</i>

07:50.540 --> 07:52.190
Um, any visitors,

07:52.490 --> 07:55.180
people coming and going
you didn't recognize?

07:56.024 --> 07:57.745
There was this one guy...

07:57.950 --> 08:01.460
but I thought he was just a
friend looking to borrow money.

08:10.630 --> 08:14.760
OK. Thank you. Look, we're
gonna find whoever did this.

08:15.850 --> 08:17.059
You shouldn't be alone right now.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.320
Oz, maybe you should take care of her.

08:19.350 --> 08:20.339
Yeah, sure.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.557
- See you guys later.
- Of course.

08:21.587 --> 08:22.422
OK.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.499
Look, Toby and Michelle,
they're a good team.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.350
They're gonna find who killed your father.

08:33.624 --> 08:34.749
(Sniffling)

08:35.443 --> 08:37.394
I don't know what hurts more,

08:38.039 --> 08:39.360
the fact that he's gone...

08:40.710 --> 08:42.730
or that I never really knew him at all.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.391
Turns out the bullet is
just a common 9-millimeter.

08:47.421 --> 08:49.518
Well, that limits it
to a few thousand guns.

08:49.548 --> 08:51.160
Well, I've been doing some research,

08:51.170 --> 08:53.539
and of all the coin
stolen in the 206 heist,

08:53.569 --> 08:56.799
a few stand out: the Valencia
doubloon, for example,

08:56.800 --> 08:58.780
is super rare and valuable.

08:58.810 --> 09:01.680
Now, I've been monitoring black
market online trading posts

09:01.690 --> 09:04.380
and there's been some chatter
over Valencia coins surfacing.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.609
I went in and posed
as an interested buyer,

09:06.610 --> 09:10.270
and so far... I've got two nibbles.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.738
One of them is a South American IP,

09:13.768 --> 09:15.255
and the other...

09:16.130 --> 09:17.652
is poorly spoofed through Russia...

09:17.682 --> 09:21.800
- and traces right back here.
- Nice work.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.290
Let's see if you can get us an address.

09:29.346 --> 09:32.738
(Piano music plays)

09:34.306 --> 09:35.192
Hey.

09:36.334 --> 09:37.289
Hey.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.709
Um...

09:40.640 --> 09:42.130
If you need anything...

09:43.980 --> 09:46.170
- Thanks, Oz.
- Yeah.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.960
My mom died before I knew her.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.389
So it was always just Buddy and me,

09:55.390 --> 09:56.510
you know what I mean?

09:57.060 --> 09:58.460
He wasn't just my daddy.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.120
He was my best friend.

10:01.830 --> 10:04.820
We trusted each other, we told
each other everything. I...

10:05.290 --> 10:08.259
Look, whatever Buddy
did before you knew him,

10:08.260 --> 10:09.560
that was somebody else,

10:10.190 --> 10:12.340
somebody he wasn't proud of.

10:13.661 --> 10:14.650
He loved you.

10:15.212 --> 10:17.580
I know. I love him too.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.350
(She sighs)

10:20.630 --> 10:22.929
Do you need a ride home or something?

10:22.959 --> 10:24.303
- Yes,
- Look...

10:24.333 --> 10:26.520
but I told my dad's lawyer

10:26.550 --> 10:28.915
that I'd meet him here, so...

10:28.945 --> 10:30.190
There he is.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.550
- OK, I'll leave you to it.
- Thanks.

10:36.653 --> 10:39.640
Emma... I know you're going through a lot.

10:40.040 --> 10:40.910
Thanks, Sam.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.200
You know, I must say I'm a bit stunned.

10:44.690 --> 10:46.329
I mean, who could've
guessed what he was hiding?

10:46.330 --> 10:48.200
- He never told you anything?
- No.

10:48.660 --> 10:52.410
But he did leave this with me
in the event of his passing.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.820
Now, this is a fairly simple will,

10:55.240 --> 10:57.629
just a savings account,
some personal effects,

10:57.630 --> 11:00.159
- but no mention of funeral arrangements.
- Well,

11:00.160 --> 11:03.860
my dad always said all he wanted
was a good old-fashioned wake.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.328
Lots of laughs and not a
sober soul in the house.

11:07.358 --> 11:08.470
(Chuckling)

11:09.110 --> 11:10.680
Oh, there's also this letter.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.020
I... hope it sheds some
light on some things.

11:19.316 --> 11:20.850
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:25.640
Yeah, that's him.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.760
That's the guy I saw
getting coins from Harvey.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.320
Let's see what else he's got.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.730
I don't know how you think I can help you.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.449
As a purveyor of valuable
antique artefacts,

11:39.450 --> 11:42.920
I deal with an exclusive list
of clients who value discretion.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.900
So you won't mind us poking
around your back rooms.

11:46.850 --> 11:49.030
You've heard of the
Flight 206 heist, right?

11:49.522 --> 11:50.873
Of course I have.

11:50.903 --> 11:54.000
The stolen gold is the Holy
Grail for coin collectors.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.228
You ever meet a guy named Buddy Carver?

11:56.432 --> 11:57.318
No.

12:07.469 --> 12:08.969
You sure about that?

12:10.196 --> 12:12.290
You asked, I answered.

12:12.450 --> 12:15.310
Well, we have a witness who
saw you at Buddy's apartment.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.819
You're one of the only people
who knew about Buddy's stash,

12:17.820 --> 12:19.089
and I'm guessing you really,

12:19.090 --> 12:21.513
really wanted to get
your hands on those coins.

12:22.062 --> 12:23.810
The Holy Grail, you called it, right?

12:27.670 --> 12:28.846
(Exhaling)

12:39.024 --> 12:40.024
Oz...

12:40.336 --> 12:41.410
- Yeah?
- Um...

12:43.142 --> 12:45.320
Can you read this letter for me?

12:47.260 --> 12:48.260
Yeah.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.200
(Exhaling) OK.

12:52.968 --> 12:54.300
"Dearest Emma,

12:54.330 --> 12:56.960
"my sunshine, my light,

12:56.990 --> 12:58.587
"I write this to tell you the truth

12:58.617 --> 12:59.792
and to ask for forgiveness

12:59.822 --> 13:01.540
"for keeping it from you all these years.

13:03.010 --> 13:05.560
"I hope you'll understand why
I never told you my real name,

13:05.820 --> 13:09.750
Harvey Winters." It's all here,

13:10.710 --> 13:13.481
the heist, why he changed his name,

13:13.511 --> 13:14.773
an apology...

13:16.919 --> 13:18.729
"People will talk of treasure,

13:18.730 --> 13:22.130
but like a sunken ship, that
secret remains underwater."

13:23.300 --> 13:24.850
Is that about the coins?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.990
2Maybe. Sounds like one of his riddles.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.659
If your dad wanted to have a wake,

13:36.660 --> 13:38.310
you could have it here.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.690
I mean, this is kind of
his home away from home.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.020
Oz, that's...

13:46.080 --> 13:47.630
that's so nice of you.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.009
I mean, you hardly know us,

13:50.010 --> 13:51.900
you've got no reason to be this kind.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.188
Just trying to get a good tip.

13:55.218 --> 13:56.825
(Laughing)

13:57.200 --> 13:58.830
That's my main focus there.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.190
Thank you, Oz.

14:08.470 --> 14:10.159
I didn't kill anyone.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.620
But maybe you know who did.

14:13.130 --> 14:16.309
<i>- Valencia. Where's the rest?
- I don't know!</i>

14:16.310 --> 14:19.860
<i>You screw with me, I will kill you.</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:23.500
If you know something
you're not telling us,

14:23.640 --> 14:24.900
this is all on you.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.220
You wanna help yourself out here.

14:27.890 --> 14:29.377
(Exhales and clears his throat)

14:29.407 --> 14:30.407
OK.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.890
I knew Buddy, but I never

14:32.900 --> 14:34.880
asked how he got his
hands on the Valencia.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.550
A couple weeks ago, someone
traced the coins to me.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.800
David Skinner?

14:40.110 --> 14:41.750
He came around looking for more, he...

14:41.760 --> 14:43.220
he didn't show ID.

14:44.220 --> 14:47.290
- How many coins did Buddy sell you?
- I bought...

14:47.950 --> 14:50.289
maybe $3,000 dollars'
worth, nothing major.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.949
The Valencia alone is
worth over a hundred grand.

14:52.950 --> 14:55.609
Buddy's asking price
was below market value.

14:55.610 --> 14:57.299
I merely paid what he asked.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.970
Right, so you knew that
you were getting a steal,

15:00.450 --> 15:02.830
and you got greedy. You
wanted the rest of them.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.758
- That's why you killed Buddy.
- No. No!

15:07.662 --> 15:09.554
(Cell phone ringing)

15:13.347 --> 15:14.430
Hey, uh,

15:14.460 --> 15:18.049
Emma's lawyer came by to drop
off the will... and a letter.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.210
What kind of letter?

15:19.230 --> 15:22.139
<i>Confirms everything.
Also, there was some...</i>

15:22.140 --> 15:24.950
cryptic phrase about a
secret underwater treasure.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.139
<i>Emma thinks it's one
of Buddy's word games.</i>

15:27.140 --> 15:29.179
Maybe he dumped it into the ocean.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.360
<i>What about the will?</i>

15:31.080 --> 15:33.169
It's pretty standard stuff,
from what I could tell.

15:33.170 --> 15:36.290
Certainly no mention of five
million in Spanish doubloons.

15:36.450 --> 15:37.700
Where's Emma now?

15:38.040 --> 15:39.810
Uh, she's just here still.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.510
<i>Hey, look, Buddy's killer
might still be out there</i>

15:43.520 --> 15:44.939
<i>and think that Emma has the gold,</i>

15:44.940 --> 15:46.289
so she could be in a little danger.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.589
Why don't you take her to my place,

15:47.590 --> 15:49.860
I'll get a unit to watch from the street.

15:49.890 --> 15:51.548
<i>Don't take your eyes off that letter.</i>

15:51.578 --> 15:52.620
Got it.

15:52.650 --> 15:56.120
But I do have to organize the wake.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.640
What wake?

15:57.860 --> 15:58.745
<i>Buddy's wake.</i>

15:58.775 --> 15:59.768
I...

16:00.160 --> 16:02.423
kind of promised Emma that
she could have it here.

16:02.453 --> 16:04.930
Dude, I don't know if that's
such a great idea right now.

16:05.010 --> 16:07.209
Toby, we've got Reginald Clarkson.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.210
Take her to my place,
I'll call you in a bit.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.720
We appreciate your
cooperation, Mr. Clarkson.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.330
I got nothing to hide.

16:15.490 --> 16:17.350
I was real sorry to hear about Harvey.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.600
He was a good man. Had a big heart.

16:21.340 --> 16:22.840
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

16:22.970 --> 16:24.229
Well, he did participate

16:24.230 --> 16:26.500
in the hijacking of a commercial airliner.

16:26.580 --> 16:29.480
Yeah, and thanks to him, that
pilot lived to tell the tale.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.260
That wasn't Skinner's plan.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.340
So Skinner was the mastermind?

16:33.656 --> 16:34.679
Way he planned it,

16:34.680 --> 16:35.789
he was gonna take us both out

16:35.790 --> 16:37.189
and keep everything for himself.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.029
Well, it didn't turn out that way, did it?

16:39.030 --> 16:40.357
He shot me.

16:40.550 --> 16:43.190
Harvey made it to the truck
and drove off with all the gold.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.880
Stiffed Skinner pretty good.

16:46.010 --> 16:48.179
Couldn't happen to a nastier guy.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.850
So Skinner could still be
after Harvey for the money.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.770
Old Harvey's a fox.

16:53.196 --> 16:55.450
He went deep for a lot of years.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.690
I trusted that if I ever got out
of here, he'd save me my share.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.019
Either of them been in contact with you

17:02.020 --> 17:03.590
over the last few years?

17:03.777 --> 17:04.510
(Exhales)

17:04.540 --> 17:06.760
A few weeks ago, Skinner called,

17:07.180 --> 17:09.669
said one of the coins had
popped up on some website,

17:09.670 --> 17:11.819
wanted to know if I knew where Harvey was.

17:12.461 --> 17:14.650
Said he wouldn't kill him if I told him.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.760
What'd you tell him?

17:16.099 --> 17:18.960
Said I had no idea where
Harvey was, never did.

17:19.410 --> 17:20.859
He didn't believe me, though.

17:21.619 --> 17:23.670
Said he'd be waiting
for me when I get out.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.780
Said he was gonna finish
the job, this time.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.619
So our coin dealer,
Colin Lang, gets sloppy,

17:33.620 --> 17:35.739
sells one of the rare
coins from the heist.

17:35.740 --> 17:38.389
Someone clocks it, tracks him
down and makes him give up Harvey.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.249
And that guy could be Skinner.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.779
And if it was, and he didn't
get what he wanted from Harvey...

17:42.780 --> 17:44.159
He'd go after the daughter.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.480
Emma's at my place with Oz right now.

17:46.490 --> 17:49.510
I should probably get him to
call off the wake for her safety.

17:51.936 --> 17:53.150
What?

17:53.180 --> 17:55.799
Well, if there is a wake,

17:55.800 --> 17:58.339
Skinner may come looking for Emma there.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.410
If we happen to have
the place staked out...

18:00.480 --> 18:01.339
You're not suggesting that

18:01.340 --> 18:03.199
we use the daughter as bait, are you?

18:03.200 --> 18:04.790
I'll get backup standing by.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.720
She won't be safe until we find him.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.880
It's the right move.

18:13.438 --> 18:16.240
Thanks, I'm staying at a friend's tonight.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.360
You're so sweet, Jess.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.360
I'll see you and the girls there later.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.810
Great. Bye.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.669
Look, Emma, I can only imagine

18:33.670 --> 18:35.660
what you're going
through, but this wake...

18:35.740 --> 18:36.939
They're just gonna use it to try

18:36.940 --> 18:38.189
to trap this Skinner guy.

18:38.190 --> 18:41.159
Good. Whatever it takes.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.930
But what if something
goes wrong? You know, I...

18:44.140 --> 18:46.059
We don't want you to get hurt.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.570
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.440
Dad always told me you can't live in fear.

18:50.990 --> 18:52.850
That you had to face life head-on.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.170
Funny, he spent his whole life hiding.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.359
He wanted you to know the truth,

18:57.360 --> 18:58.900
or he wouldn't have written that letter.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.550
You mind if I see it?

19:07.020 --> 19:10.549
This part about the... the
secret remaining underwater,

19:10.550 --> 19:12.785
does that mean anything to you?
Did your father have a boat?

19:12.815 --> 19:14.575
(Laughing)

19:14.890 --> 19:16.920
He was terrified of water.

19:17.370 --> 19:19.660
No, it's gotta be one of his riddles.

19:22.390 --> 19:26.310
Hold on. He gave me a paper-making
kit for my twelfth birthday.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.270
We used to make secret codes.
Hold it up to the light.

19:30.980 --> 19:32.749
Oh yeah, there's a watermark.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.919
Dad's still playing games with me.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.909
"Once it was nine, and now it's noon.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.080
Aim for the target, I'll see you soon".

19:39.220 --> 19:40.230
What does that mean?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.400
I know it from somewhere, I just...

19:43.550 --> 19:44.630
I can't remember.

19:47.507 --> 19:50.167
(Carillon music plays)

19:54.087 --> 19:55.459
I think he's leading
you towards the coins,

19:55.460 --> 19:58.089
I mean, the mention of time and target...

19:58.090 --> 20:02.090
It's gotta be about something,
I just... I don't know.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.100
Do you mind if I bring this
in to work and get it analyzed?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.020
Sure.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.499
See you guys later.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.050
Toby.

20:14.790 --> 20:16.250
Hey, listen.

20:16.280 --> 20:20.549
This girl's father was just
killed this morning, OK?

20:20.550 --> 20:23.510
Now you're gonna put her out
there as bait for some madman?

20:23.530 --> 20:26.830
The sooner we find the guy, the
sooner she gets her life back.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.694
(Soft music)

20:34.120 --> 20:35.400
Thanks for coming.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.839
There's quite a few people
here. You getting this?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.639
You're the eyes and ears now, Toby.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.320
Did you get anything on that rhyme?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.590
Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.259
Feel free to go deep with
anyone who seems suspicious.

20:53.260 --> 20:56.220
Skinner may have people
here casing out the place.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.480
How are you holding up?

20:59.630 --> 21:02.230
Hey. It's hard.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.250
Everyone's being really nice.

21:04.850 --> 21:07.130
I had no idea my dad had so many friends.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.160
There are his neighbours. I should say hi.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.320
Sure, yeah.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.540
<i>I drank with the guy.
Who would've thought?</i>

21:18.610 --> 21:21.960
<i>I should have her over for
dinner. She shouldn't be alone.</i>

21:28.592 --> 21:29.989
<i>Must know where they are.</i>

21:29.990 --> 21:31.699
<i>He wouldn't leave her with nothing.</i>

21:31.700 --> 21:33.560
Dev, I think I have something.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.910
Hey, how you doing?

21:35.970 --> 21:37.940
- You know Buddy well?
- Nah.

21:38.210 --> 21:40.090
Just thought I'd come pay my respects.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.710
- Want a shot?
- Sure.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.480
To Buddy.

21:50.730 --> 21:52.073
Thanks for the drink.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.490
Run that print, Dev.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.160
Nice work, Toby. I'll run the prints now.

22:06.920 --> 22:07.629
<i>Eyes on the door.</i>

22:07.630 --> 22:10.479
Another possible suspect
headed your way, 11 o'clock.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.630
Yeah, I'm on it.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.590
<i>There was more than she thinks.</i>

22:19.976 --> 22:22.890
It's him. Let's move. Let's go.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.270
- Who the hell are you?
- IIB.

22:26.050 --> 22:27.260
IIB?

22:27.650 --> 22:28.689
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

22:28.690 --> 22:30.148
- Michelle, gun!
- Hands up now.

22:30.178 --> 22:31.250
(People shrieking)

22:31.280 --> 22:32.870
Get your hands up now.

22:35.110 --> 22:37.010
You're making a big mistake, people.

22:37.730 --> 22:38.829
A big mistake.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.440
- We'll see about that.
- Easy.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.609
Was that him? Is it over?

22:45.610 --> 22:47.024
I hope so.

22:47.687 --> 22:50.170
That'd be a good time to wrap this up.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.100
I'm just...

22:57.130 --> 22:59.060
I'm just gonna go outside,
get some fresh air.

23:06.970 --> 23:10.566
(Thrilling music)

23:26.570 --> 23:27.750
Take care.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.791
Hey. Where's Emma?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.550
I thought, uh...

23:34.210 --> 23:35.354
She's gone!

23:38.500 --> 23:40.260
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.891
(Screaming)

23:43.100 --> 23:45.360
Help! Help!

23:45.390 --> 23:47.370
Emma! Emma!

23:48.494 --> 23:50.113
Oh, geez! Hey!

23:51.553 --> 23:52.405
Hey!

23:55.804 --> 23:57.159
Toby, you OK?

23:57.755 --> 23:59.600
(Tires screeching)

23:59.630 --> 24:01.470
Toby! Hey!

24:05.532 --> 24:08.630
Thanks. They found the car. No driver.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.129
Dev got a still of the
guy's face from the camera.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.049
- He sent it over to the wire.
- Are you sure it's Skinner?

24:13.050 --> 24:15.210
Yeah, he sent it to Clarkson
and he said it's him.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.079
We've got every unit in
town out looking for him.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.780
Good thing we stopped that sus... pect.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.259
Yeah, about that.

24:20.840 --> 24:21.850
Sergeant,

24:21.910 --> 24:24.549
meet special agent Mark Benson, FBI.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.320
He's been on the Flight
206 case for 20 years.

24:27.580 --> 24:29.059
And for some reason, he thought it was OK

24:29.060 --> 24:30.249
to continue his investigation

24:30.250 --> 24:33.019
on our turf with absolutely no clearance.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.169
Hey, I got the tip, I had to move fast.

24:35.170 --> 24:37.629
What pisses me off is how
close we all were to Skinner.

24:37.630 --> 24:39.969
Well, we have an APB
out. He won't get far.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.300
I wouldn't put money on that.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.074
With all due respect, I've been
tracking him for two decades.

24:44.104 --> 24:45.979
So, what about the gold?

24:45.980 --> 24:47.520
Any leads?

24:47.550 --> 24:48.940
(He laughs)

24:48.970 --> 24:50.640
It's OK, it's OK.

24:50.670 --> 24:53.310
Every cop in the world wants
that trophy on his mantle.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.036
I think we're done for now, Agent Benson.

24:55.066 --> 24:55.770
Done?

24:55.800 --> 24:58.790
No, we're not done until
Skinner's in custody.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.500
Good hunting, Sergeant.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.979
Yeah, his stepping on our jurisdiction

25:05.980 --> 25:08.220
may have just screwed up our entire case.

25:08.910 --> 25:10.189
Don't worry about it. When this is over,

25:10.190 --> 25:12.040
I'll give his bosses an earful.

25:12.370 --> 25:14.500
He'll be cleaning the
staff lunch room forever.

25:14.863 --> 25:16.199
Well, let's see if Dev got anything

25:16.200 --> 25:17.890
from the prints you got at the bar.

25:18.259 --> 25:21.409
So, the prints from the
shot glass matched up with...

25:21.410 --> 25:24.820
this guy. Tyson Gilbert.

25:25.210 --> 25:26.850
There he is. Thank you, social media.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.819
This guy's obsessed with unsolved cases.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.359
As you can see, he writes a crime blog,

25:30.360 --> 25:33.010
and there are a ton of
posts about Flight 206.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.969
Right, so this guy
found out about the wake

25:34.970 --> 25:36.959
and he went to rub her neck, I guess.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.389
We thought so, until I ran his name

25:38.390 --> 25:39.508
through the federal database.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.294
Guess... who has gone to visit

25:41.324 --> 25:43.160
Reginald Clarkson three times last month?

25:43.170 --> 25:45.179
That's a little bit
too close for comforts.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.520
Guess we need to bring him in.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.849
You get anything on that
rhyme in Harvey's letter?

25:48.850 --> 25:50.290
Funny that you ask.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.059
I didn't find anything
in English literature,

25:52.060 --> 25:54.289
so I thought I'd run the phrase
through some other languages.

25:54.290 --> 25:57.490
What I did get was a partial
match to something in French.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.963
The start of the rhyme,

25:58.993 --> 26:01.149
"Once it was nine and now it's noon",

26:01.150 --> 26:02.879
is from a 19th-century volume

26:02.880 --> 26:04.970
of nursery rhymes published in Belgium.

26:05.300 --> 26:08.090
And the last part, about the target?

26:08.690 --> 26:11.470
No idea. My best guess
is that Harvey made it up.

26:13.774 --> 26:15.550
I need you to think again, Emma.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.240
Do you recognize this rhyme
from your father's letter?

26:20.750 --> 26:22.570
<i>Please, Daddy!</i>

26:23.740 --> 26:25.869
<i>OK. Once it was nine,</i>

26:25.870 --> 26:28.540
<i>and now it's noon.</i>

26:29.320 --> 26:30.830
Did he use to read it to you?

26:31.180 --> 26:33.380
He did, but I'd forgotten
about it until now.

26:34.190 --> 26:36.990
<i>See? Once it was nine,</i>

26:37.080 --> 26:41.329
<i>and now it's noon.</i>

26:41.330 --> 26:43.429
<i>The rhyme! It's in my clock!</i>

26:43.430 --> 26:44.419
<i>Of course it is.</i>

26:44.420 --> 26:46.099
<i>That's why we'll keep it forever.</i>

26:46.100 --> 26:49.700
<i>That's our special, magical clock.</i>

26:53.927 --> 26:55.291
What is it?

26:55.970 --> 26:57.106
The clock.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.270
It was my favourite
thing when I was little.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.400
Where is it now?

27:02.810 --> 27:04.870
I haven't seen it in 20 years.

27:11.466 --> 27:13.170
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Gilbert.

27:13.180 --> 27:14.229
No problem.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.810
I saw you taking that guy down.

27:15.820 --> 27:17.470
Looked pretty dangerous to me.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.189
Would you be able to recognize anyone else

27:19.190 --> 27:20.799
- from the wake?
- What do you mean?

27:20.800 --> 27:24.810
We understand your Flight 206
research is quite extensive.

27:25.630 --> 27:27.389
I'm writing a book on the heist.

27:27.390 --> 27:28.640
Finding Harvey.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.960
A great story.

27:30.490 --> 27:33.420
Oh, it would be even better
with a great ending, right?

27:35.230 --> 27:37.620
You figured out where
Harvey was, didn't you?

27:37.930 --> 27:39.570
No, I couldn't.

27:39.970 --> 27:42.776
A lifelong obsession, unsolved crime

27:42.806 --> 27:44.391
that can't pay much.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.249
What are you saying?

27:46.250 --> 27:47.889
If you figured out
where two of the world's

27:47.890 --> 27:50.180
most notorious fugitives were,

27:50.460 --> 27:51.989
you'd become part of the legend.

27:51.990 --> 27:53.870
You'd be the one who
pieced it all together.

27:53.990 --> 27:55.259
What is it you're looking for?

27:55.260 --> 27:56.470
The gold or Harvey?

27:57.400 --> 27:58.569
If I'd have gotten to Harvey first,

27:58.570 --> 28:00.830
none of this would've happened.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.620
Alright, so let's say
you couldn't find Harvey.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.470
You did find David Skinner.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.660
- Never laid eyes on him.
- Where did you find him?

28:13.770 --> 28:16.690
Such an honor. Huge fan.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.519
Everything you know,

28:19.520 --> 28:21.250
you tell me.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.490
Where'd you meet him?

28:25.290 --> 28:27.360
Can't let him know he's at the Concord.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.009
He'd kill me.

28:29.010 --> 28:30.319
Mr. Gilbert, we have witnesses who

28:30.320 --> 28:32.610
saw you at the Concord Hotel.

28:33.810 --> 28:36.120
Is that where you guys met
to plan Harvey's murder?

28:37.490 --> 28:40.010
Hey, I had nothing to
do with Harvey's death.

28:40.310 --> 28:43.540
If Skinner did and you helped
him, you're going down too.

28:45.095 --> 28:46.630
(Sighing)

28:46.660 --> 28:50.139
OK. I heard about the Valencia coin

28:50.140 --> 28:51.909
floating around on the black market,

28:51.910 --> 28:54.230
so I fished around.

28:54.540 --> 28:57.830
I made it sound like I
knew where it had come from.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.839
All I wanted to do is connect with Skinner

29:00.840 --> 29:02.890
to see if he was still really out there.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.590
He took the bait.

29:04.970 --> 29:07.520
I connected with the legend himself.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.219
But he refused to believe

29:09.220 --> 29:11.610
I had no idea where
Harvey or the coins were.

29:12.026 --> 29:13.390
He kept threatening me.

29:13.590 --> 29:16.200
I don't think Skinner
would leave any witnesses.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.100
He must have needed you for something.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.939
Did he leave you a way to contact him

29:19.940 --> 29:21.330
in case you found the gold?

29:23.430 --> 29:24.520
Where's Skinner?

29:28.032 --> 29:29.293
(Sighing)

29:35.531 --> 29:36.776
Stop right now!

29:43.805 --> 29:45.020
Hey!

29:45.050 --> 29:46.399
Stay with me. Hey!

29:46.429 --> 29:47.716
Talk to me.

29:47.746 --> 29:50.210
- I'll call it in.
- Talk to me.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.019
Screw you.

29:52.049 --> 29:53.620
You didn't have to kill Harvey.

29:54.150 --> 29:56.710
<i>Someone beat me to it.</i>

30:02.740 --> 30:03.941
Yeah, OK.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.513
Thanks.

30:13.369 --> 30:14.886
Skinner's in the ICU.

30:16.131 --> 30:17.157
Hopefully he pulls through.

30:17.187 --> 30:19.590
If he does, he's going
away for Flight 206.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.200
Yeah, Tia just told me

30:21.210 --> 30:23.089
that every network in
town has a satellite truck

30:23.090 --> 30:24.369
parked outside the hospital.

30:24.370 --> 30:25.970
This is gonna be huge.

30:27.185 --> 30:28.060
Michelle, it's a win.

30:28.070 --> 30:29.161
We got the guy.

30:29.191 --> 30:30.940
Not for the murder of Harvey.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.140
You're sure it wasn't Skinner?

30:33.710 --> 30:35.699
I got a strong hit before he passed out.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.587
He was pretty pissed that
someone else beat him to it.

30:39.028 --> 30:40.647
So we're back to square one.

30:40.911 --> 30:41.797
Well,

30:41.827 --> 30:45.560
Emma's still trying to figure
out the meaning of Harvey's rhyme.

30:45.590 --> 30:46.699
I should go see her,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.590
- see if anything's shaking loose.
- OK.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.340
Are you sure it wasn't him?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.179
Yeah, we're pretty sure.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.408
So my dad's murderer is still out there!

30:57.438 --> 30:58.710
(Doorbell ringing)

30:58.740 --> 31:00.440
Oh, that's Buddy's...

31:00.890 --> 31:01.580
Harvey's lawyer.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.440
He was supposed to come by.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.630
Hey, how you doing?

31:05.670 --> 31:07.660
- Emma's just in there.
- Thank you.

31:07.670 --> 31:10.669
I'm just here to have
you sign some documents.

31:10.670 --> 31:13.999
- Sure, come on in.
- Sam Langston.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.389
Yeah, Toby Logan. I'm
actually with the IIB.

31:16.390 --> 31:19.600
We're investigating Harvey's case,

31:19.980 --> 31:21.520
but we're protecting Emma

31:21.650 --> 31:23.500
until we can ensure her safety.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.880
Well, that's understandable.

31:26.390 --> 31:29.429
So, uh... here...

31:29.430 --> 31:31.450
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

31:32.585 --> 31:33.590
Sure.

31:33.820 --> 31:36.440
So her father didn't leave her anything?

31:36.450 --> 31:37.800
- No property?
- No,

31:37.830 --> 31:39.199
other than a small savings account,

31:39.200 --> 31:41.410
he had no significant holdings.

31:47.577 --> 31:49.521
_

31:49.850 --> 31:52.260
Oh, I guess... maybe you're not aware.

31:52.830 --> 31:55.469
- Not aware of what?
- Well, we know that Harvey,

31:55.470 --> 31:58.770
under the name of Buddy Carver,
owned a commercial building.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.041
Um, ah... Well...

32:02.450 --> 32:04.546
Maybe he used another lawyer.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.772
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

32:07.154 --> 32:09.759
So he just... left her a letter?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.829
That was it? He didn't say what was in it?

32:11.830 --> 32:14.980
No, no, it was sealed
for Emma's eyes only.

32:15.050 --> 32:16.652
And it stayed that way.

32:17.606 --> 32:19.533
_

32:32.440 --> 32:34.100
You're lying, aren't you?

32:34.130 --> 32:37.740
You opened the letter. You
knew about Buddy Carver.

32:39.010 --> 32:41.739
I bet you we'll find your
saliva on the envelope.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.009
No, look, I...

32:43.010 --> 32:45.949
I just came here to help out
a young woman in distress.

32:45.950 --> 32:48.669
Emma, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave.

32:48.670 --> 32:49.569
No, no, no, no.

32:49.570 --> 32:52.560
I'm afraid you're staying.
You're coming with me.

32:55.090 --> 32:57.269
So he finds out that Harvey has the gold,

32:57.270 --> 33:00.589
he breaks into Harvey's
apartment, Harvey comes home,

33:00.590 --> 33:01.609
there's a confrontation,

33:01.610 --> 33:04.379
and he ends up killing him before
he can find out where it is.

33:04.380 --> 33:07.430
Right, right, right. He
gives the letter to Emma,

33:07.620 --> 33:11.030
hoping that she'll be able
to figure out Harvey's puzzle.

33:11.060 --> 33:12.640
There's a wrinkle, though.

33:13.170 --> 33:16.220
Sam insisted that Harvey
didn't own any property,

33:16.340 --> 33:19.029
but I got a read of him
with the deed to a property

33:19.030 --> 33:21.559
that Harvey owned. Dev's
checking it out right now.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.750
And his will didn't
mention anything about it.

33:24.430 --> 33:26.860
Maybe he was trying to hide
something and forged the will.

33:26.930 --> 33:28.180
Toby was right.

33:28.190 --> 33:29.529
Harvey did own property.

33:29.530 --> 33:30.309
He bought it through Sam,

33:30.310 --> 33:31.959
had it registered to a numbered company,

33:31.960 --> 33:34.090
but I was able to trace
it back to Buddy Carver.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.560
- Maybe the gold coins are there.
- The secrecy makes you wonder.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.280
Well, it's easy enough to check out.

33:39.290 --> 33:42.870
It's the same place he's been
living in for the past 25 years.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.460
That's Oz's building.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.580
I'm gonna give him a call.

33:50.770 --> 33:52.299
- Hang on a sec, OK?
- Sure.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.179
Toby, what's up?

33:53.180 --> 33:54.099
Tell me you didn't know that

33:54.100 --> 33:55.809
- Harvey owned your building.
- What?

33:55.810 --> 33:58.289
I had to deal with a
property management company.

33:58.290 --> 33:59.500
Are you serious?

33:59.510 --> 34:00.719
Yeah, man, he owned the place.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.260
Maybe he didn't want anyone
to know. Did Emma know?

34:03.290 --> 34:05.723
Hey, Emma, did you know
your dad owns my building?

34:06.047 --> 34:08.179
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, she doesn't know.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.699
Look, he may have hid the
gold coins somewhere in there.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.132
Geez, this is... this is a lot.

34:14.163 --> 34:15.715
Look, sit tight. I'll call you right back.

34:15.745 --> 34:17.947
OK, thanks.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.310
- Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
- To the pub.

34:20.340 --> 34:22.309
What? Toby said for us to stay put.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.750
I can't sit here anymore, Oz.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.409
I need to get my life back,

34:26.409 --> 34:30.510
and finding those coins is the
only way that's gonna happen.

34:31.190 --> 34:32.485
You can stay here,

34:33.054 --> 34:35.699
or you can come with me, 'cause I'm going.

34:37.150 --> 34:38.364
Just...

34:38.810 --> 34:40.139
Ugh, OK!

34:46.650 --> 34:49.199
You knew who Buddy was and where he lived.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.370
You figured that he had the coins.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.929
He caught you looking for
the gold, so you killed him.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.478
(Scoffing)

34:55.507 --> 34:56.520
Why would anybody

34:56.530 --> 34:59.440
kill the one person who
knew where the gold was?

34:59.470 --> 35:01.049
'Cause you knew there
was a clue in the letter.

35:01.050 --> 35:02.349
All you had to do get it to Emma,

35:02.350 --> 35:04.120
and hopefully she would lead you to it.

35:04.260 --> 35:06.929
The only way that was gonna
happen was if Harvey was dead.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.290
- I didn't kill him!
- Then who did?

35:11.138 --> 35:12.352
(Choking)

35:12.382 --> 35:15.070
<i>I don't know where! Honest!</i>

35:15.850 --> 35:17.209
Someone found out that you knew

35:17.210 --> 35:18.870
Buddy was Harvey, didn't they?

35:19.950 --> 35:21.220
Where are you getting this?

35:21.740 --> 35:25.379
Look, we wanna help you out
here, Sam. He killed Harvey.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.989
You might be next.

35:29.584 --> 35:31.472
(Sighing)

35:33.670 --> 35:37.050
He tracked Harvey down
through the coin dealer.

35:37.730 --> 35:40.030
And then he phoned Harvey
and that's how he got to me.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.280
And you told him about the
letter. (laughing nervously)

35:45.010 --> 35:47.670
- I... I didn't exactly have a choice.
- Who is he?

35:50.060 --> 35:51.589
<i>Well, you're in it now, aren't you?</i>

35:51.590 --> 35:54.379
<i>Twenty years of my life on this case.</i>

35:54.380 --> 35:57.649
<i>I'm gonna need something
more than a cheap ass pension</i>

35:57.650 --> 35:59.500
<i>to show for it.</i>

36:03.170 --> 36:05.240
It's the FBI guy, isn't it?

36:07.020 --> 36:09.410
He told me he was gonna
ruin me if I didn't help him.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.429
We gotta get him into
protective custody stat.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.180
- I need to call Oz.
- OK.

36:15.885 --> 36:17.600
Hey, you think we've
looked around long enough?

36:17.630 --> 36:18.576
I mean, there's nothing here.

36:18.606 --> 36:20.020
- We should go.
- No!

36:20.050 --> 36:22.500
OK. "Hit the target
and I'll see you soon".

36:22.740 --> 36:24.120
It has to mean something!

36:24.640 --> 36:27.050
Where would you hide
millions' worth of gold coins?

36:28.900 --> 36:30.400
The lease agreement.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.108
- Ah!
- What is it?

36:33.300 --> 36:36.550
He placed this weird clause
in the lease agreement.

36:37.870 --> 36:40.329
Where is it here? "Alterations."

36:40.330 --> 36:41.179
"Tenant may renovate

36:41.180 --> 36:43.319
according to building
code, with one exception:

36:43.320 --> 36:45.600
do not alter the dartboard cabinet."

36:45.650 --> 36:47.890
So you found it. Congrats.

36:48.010 --> 36:50.479
Oh, it's OK. Mark Benson with the FBI.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.679
I've been assisting the IIB
with their investigation.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.039
I was undercover at the time.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.670
Surprised they didn't tell ya.

36:55.905 --> 36:57.388
Yeah, me too.

36:57.418 --> 36:58.616
Well, um...

36:59.230 --> 37:00.155
You're just in time.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.359
We think we might have found
where Buddy's treasure is.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.320
That's great work! So?

37:04.570 --> 37:05.890
- Where's the target?
- (Cell phone ringing)

37:05.920 --> 37:07.309
Just gonna take this phone call.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.770
It's Toby. Probably wants
to tell me you're here.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.998
Now, you see... (gun cocking)
I can't let you do that.

37:13.442 --> 37:14.907
Put the phone down.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.960
Alright, thanks, babe. Call you later.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.149
So, Oz and Emma left my house.

37:24.150 --> 37:26.850
He didn't leave a note,
he's not answering his cell.

37:27.110 --> 37:28.930
Dev, can you trace his cell?

37:28.960 --> 37:30.090
Yeah, not a problem.

37:30.310 --> 37:32.730
- Why the hell would they leave the house?
- He knows the danger.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.079
He wouldn't leave without a good reason.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.760
Maybe someone forced him.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.560
OK, I got him.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.490
It looks like his cell phone's at the pub.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.070
We're on our way. Corporal,
scramble some backup.

37:45.570 --> 37:47.409
So, uh, how'd you know we were here?

37:47.410 --> 37:48.539
I've been following the only one

37:48.540 --> 37:50.540
who could lead me to Harvey's stash.

37:50.730 --> 37:54.280
Now, let's see what's
behind that dartboard.

37:54.896 --> 37:55.770
Oh, I'm not supposed

37:55.800 --> 37:57.530
- to move it, it's...
- Do it.

37:57.730 --> 37:59.036
- Oz!
- OK.

38:03.969 --> 38:06.219
You killed my dad for a few gold coins?

38:06.220 --> 38:09.130
Five million in Spanish
gold doubloons, sweetheart.

38:09.140 --> 38:11.479
And judging from the way
your father lived his life,

38:11.480 --> 38:13.229
I bet most of it is still in there.

38:13.230 --> 38:15.669
OK, I'm sorry, this thing's not budging.

38:15.670 --> 38:17.491
Put some muscle into it!

38:31.050 --> 38:32.450
Whaaaat?

38:33.100 --> 38:34.718
It's my clock!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.939
That's the treasure my dad was
talking about in the letter.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.014
He knew I wouldn't care about the coins.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.449
I can't believe I've been here...

38:40.450 --> 38:42.180
I walk by this thing
a thousand times a day!

38:42.190 --> 38:44.110
I had no idea. Look at this!

38:44.250 --> 38:45.590
Alright, fill it up.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.860
Quick! Let's go! Move it!

38:50.113 --> 38:52.432
(Tires screeching)

39:04.450 --> 39:05.750
We're going around back.

39:06.730 --> 39:07.706
Got it.

39:08.090 --> 39:11.610
Sooner we get this done, sooner
we're out of here. Oh, geez!

39:12.120 --> 39:13.267
Oz...

39:13.850 --> 39:15.260
He's not gonna let us go.

39:17.140 --> 39:19.099
Hey, we'll give you a healthy
head start when you're...

39:19.100 --> 39:20.170
I'm sorry.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.990
I can't risk the two of
you ruining my retirement.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.925
(Footsteps)

39:26.320 --> 39:27.970
Drop it! Now!

39:28.530 --> 39:30.599
- Let her go!
- There's nowhere to go, Benson.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.399
No! I thought I'd go
right out the front door!

39:33.400 --> 39:34.929
Drop your guns and she doesn't get hurt!

39:34.930 --> 39:36.100
Why don't you put your gun down

39:36.130 --> 39:38.404
and we can talk about this rationally.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.069
I hope I didn't overstep my bounds there.

39:44.070 --> 39:45.329
I mean, you had him lined up,

39:45.330 --> 39:46.189
but the bottle was sitting

39:46.190 --> 39:48.560
- just right over there. Sorry.
- You did great.

39:48.580 --> 39:51.240
It's not strictly by the
book, but we'll take the win.

39:52.212 --> 39:53.661
You want the collar?

39:54.790 --> 39:56.050
Aren't you generous!

40:05.320 --> 40:09.600
- Check it.
- There she is, the Page One girl!

40:09.760 --> 40:10.910
Check it out.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.950
Look at that! You're famous.

40:15.210 --> 40:16.369
It doesn't hurt that your girlfriend

40:16.370 --> 40:18.420
- wrote the article.
- Sure.

40:18.540 --> 40:21.309
I, uh... I have interviews
booked until midnight.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.739
Hey, it's not every day that we wrap up

40:22.740 --> 40:24.469
a 25-year-old fugitive case.

40:24.470 --> 40:26.009
And solve a murder to boot.

40:26.010 --> 40:28.639
- With a little help from our buddy Oz.
- Yes.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.789
The FBI took Agent Benson into custody.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.489
Turns out the gun that killed
Harvey was a drop gun he carried.

40:33.490 --> 40:34.879
We found it in his hotel room.

40:34.880 --> 40:38.490
Nice. Well, score another one
for the good guys. Good work.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.219
- That's a nice shot.
- Thanks.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.529
Much deserved.

40:46.930 --> 40:48.150
Nice!

40:49.990 --> 40:51.760
Gorgeous! Look at that!

40:51.810 --> 40:53.650
Looks like she's doing OK.

40:54.290 --> 40:56.189
I'm thrilled that she's back. I love her.

40:56.190 --> 40:57.619
Well, she's pretty lovable.

40:57.620 --> 40:59.055
<i>Amazing.</i>

40:59.500 --> 41:00.989
OK, rebound! That's great, guys.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.910
You keep it going, OK?

41:04.750 --> 41:05.679
Hi, guys!

41:05.680 --> 41:07.950
Hey. I think you would be happy to know

41:07.960 --> 41:10.419
that the gold is on its
way back to San Francisco

41:10.420 --> 41:13.200
and that Buddy didn't use
any of it to buy the building,

41:13.230 --> 41:14.489
so the building is yours,

41:14.490 --> 41:15.730
fair and square.

41:16.290 --> 41:19.400
And the saga of Flight
206 has come to an end.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.629
So you're back to just being your regular,

41:21.630 --> 41:24.109
run-of-the-mill terrific lady

41:24.110 --> 41:26.550
and excellent basketball coach.

41:27.830 --> 41:29.750
Well, the team needs me and I need them.

41:30.103 --> 41:31.262
<i>- Oops!
- Oh!</i>

41:31.292 --> 41:32.690
Oop - ha!

41:32.720 --> 41:33.659
Hey, how you doing?

41:33.660 --> 41:34.829
- Good, how you doing?
- Pretty good.

41:34.830 --> 41:37.659
- Let's do this.
- Guard the 3-point line.

41:37.660 --> 41:38.909
He's deadly.

41:39.930 --> 41:43.160
So, I know it wasn't under
ideal circumstances, but I...

41:43.660 --> 41:47.473
I enjoyed laying low with you.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.569
Or hiding out together.

41:49.570 --> 41:52.379
I... I, you know, just...

41:52.380 --> 41:54.110
Don't be a stranger, OK?

41:54.220 --> 41:55.780
Are you calling me strange?

41:56.420 --> 41:59.369
You are the daughter of one of
history's most wanted fugitives,

41:59.370 --> 42:01.409
and you have a thing for old clocks,

42:01.410 --> 42:03.393
which is... kind of creepy, yeah.

42:03.423 --> 42:05.200
(Laughing)

42:05.770 --> 42:08.470
I'm gonna be travelling with
the team the next little while,

42:08.480 --> 42:11.030
but, uh... don't forget, Oz,

42:11.090 --> 42:12.700
I'm your landlord now.

42:12.810 --> 42:15.409
You'll start to dread the
sight of me soon enough.

42:15.410 --> 42:18.376
Well, I don't know if
that's gonna happen, but...

42:18.406 --> 42:19.349
I mean...

42:19.350 --> 42:21.479
whatever, try... I dare ya

42:21.480 --> 42:23.889
- to come by every day and hang out...
- Oz.

42:23.890 --> 42:25.750
- to see how much I can take.
- Oz.

42:30.450 --> 42:33.829
It's, uh... it's just
gonna take a little time.

42:33.830 --> 42:36.820
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

42:39.820 --> 42:41.765
OK, let's go!

42:42.600 --> 42:43.680
I don't know if I should be worried,

42:43.690 --> 42:47.080
like, I feel like you're coming
into my hero territory here.

42:47.110 --> 42:48.519
Keeping the girls safe,

42:48.520 --> 42:49.550
tracking down the loot...

42:49.560 --> 42:50.979
I don't know what else you could do.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.540
I'll tell you what, you
let me know if there's ever

42:53.580 --> 42:55.729
- an empty desk at the IIB.
- You know what?

42:55.730 --> 42:57.750
Nah, you're better at the bar.

42:58.340 --> 43:00.239
Hey, speaking of which,
the IIB is gonna pay

43:00.240 --> 43:03.995
- to replace that dartboard, right?
- No, most likely not.

43:05.170 --> 43:06.623
