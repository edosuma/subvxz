WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.708
Is something wrong?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.244
Hey, it's okay.
You can tell me.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.413
Well, you know
Josh at school?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.314
Mm-hmm.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.815
His parents
are divorced

00:16.917 --> 00:18.617
and they're getting
married again...

00:18.719 --> 00:20.586
..to each other.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.355
Oh, sweetheart.
Listen, that's not gonna

00:23.457 --> 00:25.858
happen with your
daddy and me, okay?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.826
Daddy and I are getting
divorced because

00:27.928 --> 00:31.497
we just can't live
together anymore.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.298
Yeah, okay.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.801
But you know that it has
nothing to do with you,

00:35.903 --> 00:38.337
right? We both love
you more than anything

00:38.439 --> 00:40.539
in the whole
wide world.

00:40.641 --> 00:44.510
Hey, I mean it.
More than anything.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.781
d

00:50.985 --> 00:52.551
God, you're so
lucky, Jess.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.720
Three days away from
this miserable place.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.723
Three days of fun,
sun, and sex in Texas.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.958
Well, I would hardly
call three days at the

01:00.061 --> 01:01.827
Insurance Analysts of
America Conference

01:01.929 --> 01:03.562
a wild weekend.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.664
Insurance Analysts
of America...

01:05.766 --> 01:07.332
I can barely
even pronounce it.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.902
And Texas is
the land of cowboys.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.171
Didn't you always have
a thing for cowboys?

01:12.273 --> 01:15.407
Okay, but seriously,
Jess, all you ever do

01:15.509 --> 01:17.376
is work and take
care of Danny.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.777
You haven't even
been on a date

01:18.879 --> 01:20.879
since you and
Lars split.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.048
I mean, I know
your work is wild,

01:23.150 --> 01:26.151
but when's the last
time you even got laid?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.786
Maddie, I don't even
know the last time

01:27.888 --> 01:30.355
a man actually held
the door open for me.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.458
Come on, you know I have
to be careful with the...

01:32.560 --> 01:34.326
everything. You
know, until the

01:34.428 --> 01:36.495
divorce and custody
suit are settled.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.596
I know.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.431
Well, it's my fault
for marrying a lawyer.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.434
A good lawyer who's going
to use my past against me

01:42.536 --> 01:43.402
in court.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.204
What past? You
were 19 years old

01:45.306 --> 01:46.805
and you got involved
with some creep.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.207
Yeah, and I
got arrested for

01:48.309 --> 01:50.008
possession of a
controlled substance.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.443
Please. You
were vulnerable.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.945
Your mom had
just passed away.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.413
It's not gonna
stop Lars from

01:54.515 --> 01:55.814
using it against
me in court.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.516
He's going to paint
me as an unfit parent

01:57.618 --> 01:58.884
with a history of
drug problems.

01:58.986 --> 01:59.918
What a jerk.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.220
Yeah.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.521
Well, can you just
promise me to have

02:02.623 --> 02:03.956
a little bit of fun
on this weekend?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.326
No, no. What
is this?

02:12.366 --> 02:14.967
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.369
Mm-hmm.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.608
d

02:26.981 --> 02:28.881
Okay? Listen, you
be well behaved

02:28.983 --> 02:30.482
for daddy while
I'm gone, okay?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.517
Okay.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.518
I'm gonna
miss you.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.785
I'm gonna miss
you, too.

02:33.888 --> 02:34.786
I love you,
sweetheart.

02:34.889 --> 02:35.954
I'll call you
from Texas, okay?

02:36.056 --> 02:37.589
Bye.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.957
Have fun.

02:40.861 --> 02:49.368
d

02:49.470 --> 02:50.936
You're seven
minutes late.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.638
There was traffic
on the freeway.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.273
And besides, it's
just seven minutes.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.908
No, Jessica, it's not
just seven minutes.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.509
It's his
whole life.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.510
It's about
discipline,

02:58.612 --> 02:59.845
it's about basic
life lessons.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.313
You make a
promise, you keep it.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.347
Okay, Lars,
you know what?

03:02.449 --> 03:03.515
I never made you
any promises.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.917
And that is exactly what
I'm going to bring up

03:05.019 --> 03:06.151
at the
custody hearing.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.886
You know what, Lars, if
you spent more time being

03:07.988 --> 03:09.321
his parent maybe you
would understand that

03:09.423 --> 03:10.923
seven minutes is like
seven seconds when

03:11.025 --> 03:12.324
it comes to getting
an eight year old

03:12.426 --> 03:13.625
ready to leave
the house.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.860
We'll see what
the judge thinks.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.428
Well, Danny thinks we're
getting back together.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.797
So maybe you should
explain that one to him.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.972
I'm sorry. I
don't see it.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.707
Um, well, can you
just check again?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.876
It should be under
Klint - Jessica Klint.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.412
I'm sorry, but
it's not here.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.948
But... it
has to be.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.350
I've had the reservation
for over a month.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.185
It's Klint with
a K, not a C.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.853
Look, ma'am, there's
a conference here

03:41.956 --> 03:43.488
and all the
rooms are booked.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.224
You must have cancelled
the reservation.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.325
But, no,
I didn't.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.826
Listen, I'm actually
here for that conference.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.194
Excuse me, but I
think you owe the lady

03:49.296 --> 03:50.362
an apology.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.030
Sir, please,
there's people waiting.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.699
They can just keep
on waiting until we

03:53.801 --> 03:55.400
get this whole thing
straightened out.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.902
Are they any
more important

03:57.004 --> 03:58.370
than Miss
Jessica Klint?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.072
You're clearly
overbooking.

04:00.174 --> 04:03.375
Now I'm sure you mean
well, but I get it,

04:03.477 --> 04:05.043
there's not
much you can do.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.212
So how about you
go get us a manager

04:07.314 --> 04:09.181
who can make
things right.

04:09.283 --> 04:15.988
d

04:16.089 --> 04:17.656
I don't believe we've
been properly introduced.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.158
Harry Gordon, ma'am.
At your service.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.427
Hi, I'm Jessica
Klint. With a...

04:22.529 --> 04:25.063
A "K"
Interesting.

04:25.165 --> 04:29.334
d

04:29.436 --> 04:31.436
It was so wonderful
the way you got

04:31.538 --> 04:33.572
the manager to
find us these rooms.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.407
I never would have
been able to do that.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.242
I saw this beautiful
damsel in distress

04:37.344 --> 04:38.877
I just had
to impress.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.612
It's just the way we
do things in Texas.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.913
Well, thank you.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.048
This is it.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.151
Well, I'm gonna
go find my room,

04:46.253 --> 04:47.953
take a hot
shower and then

04:48.055 --> 04:49.388
head downstairs
for dinner.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.091
If you're interested
in joining me...

04:53.193 --> 04:55.527
for dinner,
that is,

04:55.629 --> 04:58.230
I'll be at the restaurant
downstairs tonight.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.261 --> 05:28.427
French food
sound okay?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.095
Sounds amazing.

05:30.197 --> 05:33.265
d

05:33.367 --> 05:34.433
Thank you.

05:34.535 --> 05:49.181
d

05:49.283 --> 05:51.650
This was a
really great idea.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.052
To tell you
the truth,

05:54.154 --> 05:58.156
this is the best time
I've had in a year.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.592
Since my
wife died,

06:00.694 --> 06:03.295
I just spend all
my time working.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.630
Otherwise, if I
stopped to think

06:05.733 --> 06:08.066
about it, a
little loneliness...

06:08.168 --> 06:11.670
it-it starts to feel
like a physical pain.

06:11.772 --> 06:17.042
I know...
loneliness.

06:17.144 --> 06:21.480
No. You're too
sweet and beautiful.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.282
I can't imagine
anyone leaving you alone.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.251
Oh, yeah? Well,
you could ask my

06:26.353 --> 06:27.786
soon-to-be
ex-husband.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.789
He, um, he found
it pretty easy.

06:30.891 --> 06:40.632
d

06:40.734 --> 06:43.602
How about
a dance?

06:43.704 --> 06:47.239
What? Now?

06:47.341 --> 06:49.708
Why not?

06:49.810 --> 06:52.811
Um...

06:52.913 --> 07:08.860
d

07:10.964 --> 07:13.031
Darlin', you
have just got the

07:13.133 --> 07:15.500
sweetest smile
I've ever seen.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.337
Your husband must be
one unenlightened soul.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.705
He is.

07:20.808 --> 07:24.910
I mean, not just
when it comes to me,

07:25.012 --> 07:28.580
but just in general,
his outlook.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.917
He only sees what
he wants to see,

07:32.019 --> 07:34.719
he only does
what he wants to do.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.122
Why'd you
marry him?

07:37.224 --> 07:41.560
I was young and
foolish, and...

07:41.662 --> 07:43.261
pregnant.

07:43.363 --> 07:48.400
d

07:48.502 --> 07:50.135
Listen, I know
about this great bar

07:50.237 --> 07:51.436
across the street.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.605
How about we head
over there for a drink?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.140
I would
love to.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.843
But I have to
get up by six

07:57.945 --> 08:00.445
for the
conference tomorrow.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.581
Insurance conference,
you said it was?

08:02.683 --> 08:03.748
Yeah.

08:03.851 --> 08:04.749
Oh, that
sounds exciting.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.485
Living on
the edge.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.953
You know what?

08:08.055 --> 08:10.255
Just because my job is
risk averse doesn't mean

08:10.357 --> 08:13.391
that I don't take
chances in my own life.

08:13.494 --> 08:18.230
Prove it to me.
Just one drink.

08:18.332 --> 08:23.335
d

08:23.437 --> 08:26.471
He was
a good singer.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.673
One too many.

08:28.775 --> 08:32.244
Oh, that's
amazing.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.179
How about breakfast
tomorrow morning?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.514
Bright and early?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.249
That would
be great.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.317
Well, good night.

08:39.419 --> 08:55.367
d

09:09.650 --> 09:11.883
No, he's not hot,
he's gorgeous.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.519
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i> go for it.</i>

09:14.621 --> 09:17.689
Go for what? I
just met him.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.957
<i>Who cares, Jess?</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:20.392
<i>You'll always</i>
<i> be able to say</i>

09:20.494 --> 09:22.794
<i>you had too much</i>
<i> to drink that night.</i>

09:22.896 --> 09:25.830
<i>What happens in</i>
<i> Texas, stays in Texas.</i>

09:25.933 --> 09:28.199
Oh my, God.
You're a crazy person.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.201
I'm going
to go to bed now.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.304
I love
you. Bye.

09:32.406 --> 09:37.876
d

09:53.827 --> 09:56.895
I don't really know
how to do this.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.531
You're doing
just fine.

09:59.633 --> 10:15.046
d

10:15.148 --> 10:17.015
Tell me what it is
that you've always

10:17.117 --> 10:20.185
wanted to do,
but never have.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.787
If it's our only
night together,

10:22.889 --> 10:27.359
I want it to
be unforgettable.

10:27.461 --> 10:43.408
d

11:07.768 --> 11:11.336
Is it time
to go?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.605
'fraid so.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.407
Hmm.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.508
Jessica?

11:16.610 --> 11:18.076
Mm-hmm.

11:18.178 --> 11:23.381
I know this sounds crazy,
I mean, I hardly know you.

11:23.483 --> 11:28.086
You know my situation.
The custody battle?

11:28.188 --> 11:33.858
It's just now's not a
really good time for me.

11:33.960 --> 11:39.497
You understand,
right?

11:39.599 --> 11:42.033
Aw, Jessica...

11:42.135 --> 11:44.769
It's you who
doesn't understand.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.572
I hate to do this,
baby doll, I really do,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.974
but I'm going to need
70 thousand dollars.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.509
What?

11:51.611 --> 11:53.511
What are you
talking about?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.413
I-I don't have
that kind of money.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.348
And what happened to
your southern accent?

11:57.451 --> 11:58.883
You're gonna
have to get it.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.119
I don't understand.

12:01.221 --> 12:06.524
This is a video of our
little romp last night.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.460
Your husband
hired me.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.863
He's gonna use this video
against you in court.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.600
I'm sorry about
this. I really am.

12:15.702 --> 12:19.337
That's why I'm giving you
the chance to buy it first.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.040
I don't have
that kind of money.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.510
You got a week
to get it.

12:25.612 --> 12:30.381
Meet me back in LA at
three p. m. on Monday.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.384
Otherwise...

12:33.487 --> 12:37.489
I give it to
your husband.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.024
d

12:40.127 --> 12:41.025
Please, wait.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.026
Sorry.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.728
Please?

12:43.830 --> 12:47.999
d

13:27.073 --> 13:28.873
Hi, honey.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.109
Oh, my goodness. I
missed you so much.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.143
I missed
you, too.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.645
Yeah?

13:36.950 --> 13:39.651
Everything okay?

13:41.288 --> 13:42.787
Jess,
I'm so sorry.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.088
I wish I had the
money to give you.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.957
You know I'd do it in a
heartbeat if I could.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.125
Yeah, I know.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.459
I just feel
so responsible,

13:48.562 --> 13:50.195
like I got you into
this whole mess,

13:50.297 --> 13:52.163
telling you to go on
this trip and go wild.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.532
Hey, listen, I'm a
grown woman, okay?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.235
I made my
own decisions.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.704
It's just... I don't
know how I could have

13:59.806 --> 14:01.472
been so wrong about
him, you know?

14:01.575 --> 14:02.841
I mean, he was
so sincere and...

14:02.943 --> 14:04.676
I mean, Lars
probably told him

14:04.778 --> 14:06.511
exactly how to act
to win you over.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.112
Think about it.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.848
Lars probably called
the hotel himself

14:09.950 --> 14:11.516
and cancelled
your reservation

14:11.618 --> 14:13.184
just so this young
handsome cowboy

14:13.286 --> 14:15.019
could come in
and rescue you.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.321
God, you're right.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.089
I mean, he had the
hotel information and...

14:18.191 --> 14:21.226
Oh, my, God, I think
I'm going to be sick.

14:21.328 --> 14:25.163
Even so, Jess,
you're a grown woman.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.564
It's fine.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.032
No...

14:28.134 --> 14:31.970
Look, I took
some pills.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.705
Well, I know,
I know.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.974
Look, it was- it
was stupid, okay?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.109
I had too much to drink
and I-I got carried away

14:38.211 --> 14:41.246
and, you know, if the
judge sees this tape

14:41.348 --> 14:43.815
then I'm going
to lose Danny.

14:43.917 --> 14:48.353
I can't believe I
fell for his whole act.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.955
You've been alone
for almost a year

14:51.057 --> 14:52.790
and Lars
knew that.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.727
Anyone in your situation
would have done the same.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.161
You're human,
after all.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.730
And more
importantly,

14:58.832 --> 15:00.265
you're a
wonderful mother.

15:00.367 --> 15:04.702
I think you should
just go to the cops.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.171
What? With what
evidence, Maddie?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.740
All I have is myself
having sex with

15:08.842 --> 15:10.308
some complete
stranger in a hotel

15:10.410 --> 15:12.710
and taking drugs
on top of it.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.680
d

15:15.782 --> 15:19.851
You know, if I could
prove that Lars set me up

15:19.953 --> 15:23.388
then I would have a
fighting chance, right?

15:23.490 --> 15:25.056
I mean, the judge would
have to throw out the tape

15:25.158 --> 15:27.158
if he thought it was
blackmail and extortion.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.359
I mean, it
won't be easy,

15:28.461 --> 15:30.228
but anything I
can do to help.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.267
I just can't lose
him, Maddie.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.937
He's all I have.

15:39.039 --> 15:44.142
d

15:48.315 --> 16:04.262
d

16:11.404 --> 16:12.904
Okay.

16:17.210 --> 16:23.114
d

16:26.186 --> 16:27.652
Thank you for calling
Luxury Suites.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.953
How may I
help you?

16:29.055 --> 16:30.355
<i>Yes, hi.</i>

16:30.457 --> 16:32.156
Um, my name is
Jessica Klint.

16:32.258 --> 16:35.293
Oh, yes, I
remember you.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.628
Is that Jessica
Klint with a "K"?

16:37.731 --> 16:39.297
<i>Yeah... Yeah,</i>
<i> that's right.</i>

16:39.399 --> 16:42.767
Well, as you know, I was
staying in suite 203,

16:42.869 --> 16:45.436
um, on Friday for the
Insurance Analysts

16:45.538 --> 16:49.474
Conference and, well, the
strangest thing happened.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.543
I-I met a guest there
and he accidentally

16:52.645 --> 16:54.912
left one of his
personal items with me

16:55.015 --> 16:57.348
and I would love to
get it back to him.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.417
Um, his name is
Harry Gordon.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.855
Harry Gordon... Ah,
yes, he was in 206.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.156
He checked out on
Saturday morning.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.826
Yeah. Right. Um,
I-I figured that.

17:08.928 --> 17:12.063
So listen, if you could
just give me his address

17:12.165 --> 17:13.798
I'll mail it to
him directly.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.733
Unfortunately, ma'am,
we're not allowed to give

17:15.835 --> 17:17.201
our guests'
information.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.669
However, if
you mail it to us,

17:18.771 --> 17:20.171
we can see
that he gets it.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.906
Listen, if you just,
um, you could give me

17:23.009 --> 17:24.509
his phone number
and then I'll call him

17:24.611 --> 17:26.277
and I will mail
it back to him.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.445
Unfortunately, we
can't do that either.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.181
It's just
company policy.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.249
<i>However...</i>

17:44.030 --> 17:45.430
Hello?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.565
<i>Well, hello,</i>
<i> baby doll.</i>

17:47.667 --> 17:49.934
<i>I hope you've</i>
<i> been keepin' busy.</i>

17:50.036 --> 17:52.070
<i>Remember, 70K</i>
<i> by Wednesday</i>

17:52.172 --> 17:53.871
<i>or your husband</i>
<i> gets the tape and</i>

17:53.973 --> 17:56.374
<i>you can say bye bye</i>
<i> to your boy, Danny.</i>

17:56.476 --> 17:58.843
Uh, yeah, um, hey,
listen, about that, I was-

17:58.945 --> 18:02.080
<i>Oh, and remember,</i>
<i> say no to drugs.</i>

18:09.055 --> 18:10.188
God...

18:10.290 --> 18:13.491
d

18:14.627 --> 18:16.160
Hello, Miss
Jessica.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.495
Hi, Maria.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.997
Um, listen, I looked all
over the house for Dad.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.432
Is he here?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.434
He's practicing
his golf again.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.936
He's expecting
you.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.504
What kind of
mood is he in?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.106
His usual.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.449
Hi, Daddy.
How are you?

18:38.551 --> 18:41.652
Fine. Where's Danny?
Didn't you bring him?

18:41.754 --> 18:44.622
No, I didn't. Um,
I actually wanted

18:44.724 --> 18:46.524
to talk to you
about something.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.327
Well, I take my
walk at eight o'clock.

18:49.429 --> 18:53.064
Yeah, I know. It
won't take long.

18:53.166 --> 18:59.036
d

18:59.139 --> 19:03.407
Let me guess...
It's about money.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.510
Daddy, I would never
ask you for money,

19:05.612 --> 19:09.413
but I'm
broke, okay?

19:09.516 --> 19:10.982
Lars transferred all
of our money into

19:11.084 --> 19:12.850
a private account
when I left him and

19:12.952 --> 19:14.519
my entire salary
is going toward

19:14.621 --> 19:18.656
living expenses and
legal fees and...

19:18.758 --> 19:20.491
Look, I know that you
told us never, ever to

19:20.593 --> 19:22.593
ask you for money, but
something's come up

19:22.695 --> 19:23.895
and it's an
emergency-

19:23.997 --> 19:25.563
You see right
there, Jessica.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.398
You answered
your own question.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.933
Daddy, please...

19:29.035 --> 19:30.535
Look, I could
lose Danny.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.270
You should go back
to your husband.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.437
He still
loves you.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.373
He's a good man,
a good lawyer.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.009
I used to think that you
were smarter than your

19:38.111 --> 19:41.212
sister, but you're both
a pair of damn fools!

19:41.314 --> 19:44.015
No, you know what,
don't lecture me, okay?

19:45.251 --> 19:46.517
You have more money than
you know what to do with

19:46.619 --> 19:47.919
and yet you
won't use it

19:48.021 --> 19:49.687
to help one of
your own daughters?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.322
And you watch what
you say, young lady,

19:51.424 --> 19:53.291
or I will
cut you out,

19:53.393 --> 19:59.263
just like I did that damn
fool sister of yours.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.432
What good is your
money anyway? Huh?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.002
You know I always
defended you to Allie

20:05.104 --> 20:06.637
but but she
was right.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.172
You care more
about your money

20:08.274 --> 20:10.074
than you do
about us.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.479
God...

20:15.582 --> 20:22.153
d

20:22.255 --> 20:37.068
conversations]

20:37.170 --> 20:38.302
What did
you do,

20:38.404 --> 20:40.338
start drinking before
I could get here?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.039
Excuse me?

20:42.141 --> 20:44.041
What's up with
the hair?

20:44.143 --> 20:45.776
Where'd you
get that dress?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.346
I-I'm so sorry.
Do I know you?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.581
Jess, cut it out.
You're freaking me out.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.817
Vodka soda, please.

20:52.919 --> 20:58.222
I see. You have me
confused with my sister.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.425
I assume you're a friend
of Jessica's, am I right?

21:01.527 --> 21:02.526
You're Allie.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.427
Mm-hmm.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.929
Jesus.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.231
Jess never told me you
guys were identical.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.432
Oh.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.167
It's amazing.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.702
I assume we still
look alike then.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.871
Yes. Yeah.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.773
I haven't seen
Jessica in years.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.608
Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.277
Honest, I didn't- I
didn't mean anything

21:19.379 --> 21:21.178
about the dress.
That's a lovely dress.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.614
I was just surprised
to see Jess in it.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.550
No apologies
necessary.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.219
Allie, honey.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.621
Come on now. We
don't want to be late.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.423
Listen, it was a
pleasure meeting you.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.091
Absolutely.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.093
Oh, and please do
have Jessica call me.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.728
We just moved back
into the neighborhood

21:37.830 --> 21:39.297
and I would love
to hear from her.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.398
Yeah.

21:43.369 --> 21:47.638
I'll give you
my card...

21:47.740 --> 21:49.307
I really do hope
that you'll

21:49.409 --> 21:51.108
give her
the message.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.576
Yeah, sure.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.446
It's just that, well, she
and I had a falling out

21:55.548 --> 21:59.283
years ago and, to be
honest, it was my fault.

21:59.385 --> 22:02.453
I'd do anything to
make it up to her.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.288
Please tell
her that.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.290
Yeah, I'll
tell her.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.794
Thank you
so much. Bye.

22:09.896 --> 22:19.437
d

22:19.539 --> 22:21.038
Thank you.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.576
Hey, listen, I am so
sorry that I'm so late

22:25.678 --> 22:27.378
and I appreciate all the
effort you're making

22:27.480 --> 22:28.713
to cheer
me up, but

22:28.815 --> 22:30.648
I just don't think
it's gonna work today.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.350
You are not gonna
guess who I just met.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.284
Who?

22:35.722 --> 22:36.620
Allie?

22:36.723 --> 22:38.289
Mm-hmm.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.624
So she's back in
town.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.327
Just the kind of news
I would expect today.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.562
No, no, no.
Listen.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.697
She seemed really nice
and she was beautiful.

22:46.799 --> 22:47.832
She looked
just like you-

22:47.934 --> 22:49.233
just a little
different.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.369
But she was with this
really rich-looking

22:51.471 --> 22:52.470
old guy.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.406
Yeah, probably
somebody else's husband.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.408
I don't know about
that, but I just know

22:57.510 --> 23:00.044
that I got this really
warm feeling from her.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.846
I think she just
wants you to call her.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.447
What? No,
she's a bitch.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.750
Well, I think you
should call her

23:05.852 --> 23:08.552
only if to just ask
her for some money.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.821
I mean, she looked
like she was loaded.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.157
Yeah, right.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.692
Well, didn't you say
she just called you

23:14.794 --> 23:16.360
a few months ago?

23:16.462 --> 23:17.862
Yeah, and I didn't
call her back then

23:17.964 --> 23:19.964
and I'm not gonna
call her back now, so...

23:20.066 --> 23:22.433
Jess. She clearly wants
to make up with you.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.702
She said whatever
she did was her fault.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.504
She apologized
for it.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.439
I mean, you only
have one day left.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.940
I think if you
asked her

23:30.042 --> 23:32.243
she'd just lend
you the money.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.912
I mean, what's it
hurt to ask? Right?

23:35.014 --> 23:40.951
Consider the
alternative.

23:41.053 --> 23:57.001
d

23:58.438 --> 24:00.004
Oh, Jess.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.008
d

24:04.110 --> 24:06.177
I'm so happy
you're really here.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.679
I thought about calling
you a million times,

24:08.781 --> 24:11.482
but every time I
picked up the phone

24:11.584 --> 24:14.151
I stopped myself.

24:14.253 --> 24:18.222
I knew you'd come see
me when you were ready.

24:18.324 --> 24:22.059
Please, please,
come in.

24:22.161 --> 24:28.199
d

24:28.301 --> 24:30.234
You sure you don't
want a bourbon?

24:30.336 --> 24:32.436
Yeah, I'm sure.

24:32.538 --> 24:38.108
Well, all right.
Water it is.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.410
Hmm.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.479
Ahh...

24:41.581 --> 24:46.217
I'm just so happy that
you're finally here.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.651
Allie, I think
you misunderstood

24:47.753 --> 24:49.553
the purpose of
my visit today.

24:49.655 --> 24:50.988
Mmm, no.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.624
You coming
here means that

24:53.726 --> 24:56.126
you've finally
forgiven me.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.395
I knew you wouldn't let
a man come between us.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.697
Lars didn't
come between us.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.298
God, you tried to
steal him from me.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.933
Just like you tried to
steal every single man

25:03.035 --> 25:04.602
that I've ever
been with.

25:04.704 --> 25:08.639
Jessica, I just...
I don't understand.

25:08.741 --> 25:12.009
I mean, it was
so long ago.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.312
All right, well, then
if you haven't come

25:15.414 --> 25:18.148
to make up, what are
you doing here? Hm?

25:18.251 --> 25:22.152
I need a
favor. Okay?

25:22.255 --> 25:24.488
I don't have anyone
else that I can ask.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.391
If you haven't heard,
Lars and I split up.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.226
He's trying to get full
custody of Danny and

25:29.328 --> 25:32.263
I need your help so
that I can keep my son.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.265
All right.

25:34.367 --> 25:39.637
Well, what is it
that you need exactly?

25:39.739 --> 25:43.641
Seventy thousand
dollars?

25:43.743 --> 25:45.576
For what,
might I ask?

25:45.678 --> 25:47.111
None of
your business.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.313
Excuse me? I'm
sorry, I-I could

25:49.415 --> 25:50.881
not have heard you
right, Jessica.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.150
You said that it's
none of my business

25:53.252 --> 25:55.319
even though you basically
just came here,

25:55.421 --> 25:57.821
you lectured me, told
me what a low life I am,

25:57.924 --> 26:01.659
then you had the audacity
to ask me for 70 grand.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.627
I just need
it, okay?

26:03.729 --> 26:07.398
Oh my.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.434
That is just
so interesting.

26:10.536 --> 26:16.140
You won't admit to me why
you need the money and

26:16.242 --> 26:20.311
yet you might lose your
son if you don't get it.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.679
Hmm?

26:21.781 --> 26:25.182
It must be
something bad.

26:25.284 --> 26:30.120
Something really
awful. Hmm?

26:30.222 --> 26:35.960
d

26:36.062 --> 26:38.696
Something that you're
just so ashamed of

26:38.798 --> 26:40.564
that you'd rather
risk losing Danny

26:40.666 --> 26:43.200
than admit
it to me.

26:43.302 --> 26:47.571
Oh, Jessica, you must have
done something this time.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.440
I just cannot
wait to hear

26:49.542 --> 26:51.108
what you have
to tell me.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.712
Please, please, do tell.
I love a story. Hmm.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.147
Hmm?

26:59.652 --> 27:02.453
Okay, look,
there's a guy who's

27:02.555 --> 27:05.589
blackmailing me,
okay? He has a-

27:05.691 --> 27:07.291
a tape of us together
and he's gonna

27:07.393 --> 27:09.159
give it to Lars to use
in court against me

27:09.261 --> 27:10.728
if I can't come up
with the money.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.029
So that's it,
all right?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.697
Will you give me
the money or not?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.032
Mmmm.
No, sorry,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.067
I don't really have
70 thousand to spare.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.570
You're such
a bitch.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.572
You put me
through all that,

27:21.674 --> 27:23.741
you had zero intention
of helping me.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.609
Jessica, please.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.311
Calm down. Listen,
I didn't say

27:27.413 --> 27:29.213
I wouldn't help
you, I just said

27:29.315 --> 27:30.981
that I wouldn't
lend you the money.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.884
Do you think this
stuff comes easy, hmm?

27:33.986 --> 27:39.289
I have to earn my money
just like everybody else.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.926
Okay, look, if you
don't have the money

27:43.029 --> 27:44.895
there is a way that
you can help me.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.097
All right. But if
I do you a favor

27:47.199 --> 27:48.732
then you'll
owe me. Hmm?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.334
Yeah, okay.
Fine.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.002
Oh, no, no,
no. Please.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.238
Please, don't take
this lightly, Jessica.

27:54.340 --> 27:58.776
I really, really want
you to think about it.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.812
Once you make
a deal with me

28:01.914 --> 28:03.847
you'll have to
stick to it.

28:09.555 --> 28:20.464
d

28:25.538 --> 28:27.237
Hi, doll.

28:27.339 --> 28:31.175
d

28:31.277 --> 28:33.110
I knew you'd
get it.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.247
I tried. Listen,
I-I asked everyone,

28:37.349 --> 28:39.550
but I just, I couldn't
come up with the money.

28:39.652 --> 28:42.653
Please, just-just
erase the tape, okay?

28:42.755 --> 28:44.588
I'll do anything.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.824
Harry, if you give
that tape to my husband

28:46.926 --> 28:48.492
I'll lose
everything.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.127
Sorry, babe.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.930
I gave you first dibs
on the tape, didn't I?

28:53.032 --> 28:54.832
But your husband's
paying me a lot of money

28:54.934 --> 28:57.401
and a man's got
to make a livin'.

28:57.503 --> 29:01.238
Hey, come on, don't
take it so personally.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.840
If you weren't
so great in bed

29:02.942 --> 29:05.375
it wouldn't have been
such a good tape.

29:11.016 --> 29:14.685
Well, you know if you
weren't such an idiot

29:14.787 --> 29:16.553
you'd be a moron.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.490
What? Hey. You're the
one who got screwed.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.159
Easy, cowboy.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.796
Actually, you're the
one who got screwed.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.866
But be
grateful because

29:28.968 --> 29:31.368
that's all that
you're going to get.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.970
Yeah? We'll
just see what your

29:33.072 --> 29:34.838
husband has to
say about that.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.207
Husband?
No, no.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.443
I don't have
one of those.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.445
Never have,
never will.

29:46.118 --> 29:50.921
Oh, I see. You
must be confused.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.591
You think that
I'm my sister?

29:54.693 --> 29:56.360
That happens
all the time.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.930
Although I don't believe
you've ever met her.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.066
Jessica, honey,
come here.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.103
There's someone I'd
like you to meet.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.308
How do you do?

30:16.682 --> 30:18.015
You're lyin'.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.751
No, I never
slept with you.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.753
She's the one
I slept with.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.922
But I'm
Allesandra.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.691
Gosh, and
you told me

30:27.793 --> 30:30.460
you'd never met
anyone like me.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.696
No, you
can't do this.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.264
The tape proves what
really happened

30:34.366 --> 30:35.766
and that's all
that matters.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.634
Tape?

30:37.736 --> 30:41.872
Oh, you mean
this tape.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.374
<i>I gave you first dibs</i>
<i> on the tape, didn't I?</i>

30:44.476 --> 30:46.443
<i>But your husband's</i>
<i> paying me a lot of money</i>

30:46.545 --> 30:48.579
<i>and a man's</i>
<i> gotta make a livin'.</i>

30:50.850 --> 30:53.984
Hmm. You know,
you're right.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.787
The tape does prove
what actually happened.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.488
You tried to
blackmail us,

30:58.591 --> 31:00.424
but you got the
wrong sister.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.292
Look closely at
your tape, cowboy.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.393
There's no
way to prove

31:03.495 --> 31:04.928
which one of us
you slept with.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.430
We're identical.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.066
Down to the teeniest,
tiniest freckle.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.268
And I'm willing to
testify in court

31:11.370 --> 31:13.303
that it was me that
you slept with.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.975
So you see, your
little tape is worthless.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.910
Let's let her
husband decide.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.412
Harry, if you don't
believe me and you

31:22.514 --> 31:25.282
actually dare to sell
that tape to Lars,

31:25.384 --> 31:26.950
well, then you'll
leave me no choice

31:27.052 --> 31:28.785
but to take our
tape to the cops.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.654
And that'll land your
cute little ass in jail

31:30.756 --> 31:32.556
so fast your
head will spin.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.425
I'm also gonna need
your copy of the tape.

31:35.527 --> 31:43.333
d

31:48.007 --> 31:49.806
You better
watch your back.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.842
You especially,
sweetie.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.548
Allie, you were really
wonderful back there.

31:58.651 --> 31:59.983
So were you,
sweetheart.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.819
He didn't even
know what hit him.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.488
Yeah.

32:04.590 --> 32:08.492
Huge relief, though, to
finally have it be over.

32:08.594 --> 32:12.062
It was kind of
fun though, right?

32:12.164 --> 32:13.830
Pulling the
old switcharoo.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.899
Yeah. It was.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.168
Just like
old times.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.704
We did used to
have fun, didn't we?

32:20.806 --> 32:22.072
Yeah, we did.

32:30.015 --> 32:31.448
Hey, Allie.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.816
<i>Jess, I need to</i>
<i> see you tonight.</i>

32:32.918 --> 32:34.718
Tonight?

32:34.820 --> 32:37.754
Uh, I can't, I'm gonna
take Danny to the movies.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.890
But you could
join us if you want.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.825
We're gonna go see that
superhero one with...

32:41.927 --> 32:43.794
<i>Jessica, we</i>
<i> have to talk.</i>

32:43.896 --> 32:45.662
<i>I need a favor.</i>

32:52.805 --> 32:54.838
So all I have to do is
drive down to Mexico

32:54.940 --> 32:56.673
and pick up
some package?

32:56.775 --> 32:58.642
That's it. It's
simple, huh?

32:58.744 --> 33:01.244
Why can't
you do it?

33:01.347 --> 33:02.980
Well, I just can't.
Something came up

33:03.082 --> 33:05.282
and I'm asking you
to go instead.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.950
Well, what's
in the package?

33:07.052 --> 33:08.418
Is it something
illegal?

33:08.520 --> 33:09.720
Jessica...

33:09.822 --> 33:11.989
What? I'll do it,
okay, I wanna know.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.690
Look, it's really
not a big deal.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.892
Okay? I do it
every month.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.161
I go down to Mexico,
I sit in this café,

33:18.263 --> 33:20.664
a man comes by, he
puts his hat on the table

33:20.766 --> 33:22.132
and picks
up mine.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.735
I put on his and
then I drive home.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.037
It's really
not a problem.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.039
And besides,
you promised.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.540
We made a deal
when I helped you

33:30.642 --> 33:32.476
and now it's
your turn.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.144
When do you
want me to do it?

33:34.246 --> 33:37.014
Thursday. And you're
not allowed to mention

33:37.116 --> 33:38.949
a word of this
to anyone.

33:39.051 --> 33:44.988
d

33:49.094 --> 33:50.260
Hello?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.062
<i>Jess, I need you</i>
<i> take Frank Watley</i>

33:52.164 --> 33:53.730
<i>out to Encino</i>
<i> on Thursday.</i>

33:53.832 --> 33:56.533
Oh, on
Thursday I can't.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.369
<i>You can't?</i>
<i> And why not?</i>

33:59.471 --> 34:02.472
Um, you know
what, I was-

34:02.574 --> 34:05.175
I was looking at the
wrong page on my planner

34:05.277 --> 34:07.477
and that's totally
fine. I can do it.

34:07.579 --> 34:08.578
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:08.679 --> 34:09.713
Okay.

34:09.815 --> 34:20.190
d

34:20.292 --> 34:22.391
Lars, hey. Listen,
I really need you

34:22.494 --> 34:25.829
to take Danny
on Thursday...

34:25.931 --> 34:29.565
Well, you're his
father so figure it out.

34:29.668 --> 34:33.637
d

34:47.953 --> 34:50.821
Okay, I'm supposed
to wear this?

34:50.922 --> 34:52.856
I told you, you're
me for the day.

34:52.958 --> 34:53.989
That's what
I'd wear.

34:54.092 --> 34:54.991
Okay.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.460
And besides, I
really think the hat

34:56.562 --> 34:58.462
looks cute
with the boots.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.564
Now
listen carefully.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.965
You need to be
at Café La Flora

35:02.067 --> 35:04.601
at exactly seven
o'clock. All right?

35:04.703 --> 35:06.470
You're just gonna put the
hat down on the table.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.838
Once the
exchange is made

35:07.940 --> 35:09.139
you'll start
heading back.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.508
You need to get through
customs by eight p. m.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.909
We have a
man there,

35:13.011 --> 35:14.478
he'll know you by
your hat so make sure

35:14.580 --> 35:16.513
that you keep it
on at all times.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.582
He'll wave you right
through. Got it?

35:20.986 --> 35:22.986
Allie, this is really
heavy. What's in this?

35:23.088 --> 35:25.155
Drugs? Money?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.259
Nothing.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.695
Now make sure that
you do some shopping

35:31.797 --> 35:33.497
so it looks like
you have a reason

35:33.599 --> 35:36.399
to be at the
café. All right?

35:36.502 --> 35:38.368
Here's my purse,
it has my car keys,

35:38.470 --> 35:40.203
ID, everything,
so don't lose it.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.872
And where's
your keys?

35:41.974 --> 35:43.273
They're in
my purse.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.209
Wonderful. Good
luck, darling.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.944
And just relax,
you know?

35:48.046 --> 35:49.779
You're going to
have so much fun

35:49.882 --> 35:52.849
and it'll all be over
before you know it.

35:52.951 --> 36:09.599
We'll see you
back here at 10:30.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.635
<i>Now listen carefully,</i>
<i> you have to be at</i>

36:11.737 --> 36:14.704
<i>La Flore Café at</i>

36:16.675 --> 36:19.176
What can
I get you, miss?

36:19.278 --> 36:20.877
Um, I'll have
a tea, please.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.312
Please, por favor,
if you're not

36:22.414 --> 36:23.813
gonna be eating
you have to leave.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.148
No, I'll order.

36:25.250 --> 36:29.252
I'll have, um, a tea
and, uh, a quesadilla?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.456
Thank you.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.358
<i>Look, it's really</i>
<i> not a big deal.</i>

36:35.460 --> 36:36.793

<i>and picks</i>

36:43.001 --> 36:45.435
<i>I put on his and</i>

36:45.537 --> 36:47.404
<i>It's really</i>
<i> not a problem.</i>

37:13.966 --> 37:24.407

Be careful,
senorita.

37:26.645 --> 37:36.620
d

37:36.722 --> 37:38.321
Dammit.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.337

38:15.894 --> 38:16.926
No, no, no, no.
Please don't leave.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.828
Please.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.842
ID please?

38:38.917 --> 38:40.350
Allesandra Banks?

38:40.452 --> 38:41.985
Mm-hmm.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.354
You in Mexico
for the day?

38:44.456 --> 38:45.955
Yeah, just doing
some shopping.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.708
Can you get out of
the car please?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.810
Yeah, um, sure.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.389
Empty your
purse, miss.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.624
Oh, yeah,
sure. Okay.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.963
I am so sorry.
I-I'm sorry.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.698
I'm gonna
get it.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.900
Um... Sorry.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.508
You can go.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.520
You Allesandra
Banks?

40:23.622 --> 40:26.122
Just passed through
customs a few miles back?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.892
Can I see some
ID, please?

40:28.994 --> 40:30.627
Yeah.

40:40.705 --> 40:43.072
I don't know
where it is.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.874
Just like
I thought.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.710
Here... you left
this back there.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.814
Thanks.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.449
Thank you so much.
It must have

40:52.551 --> 40:56.119
fallen out of my bag
when I dropped it.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.554
Didn't mean
to scare ya.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.589
Some folks get
a little nervous

40:59.691 --> 41:01.658
when a cop car
comes roarin' up.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.093
Yeah. Yeah, it's a
little nerve wracking.

41:04.196 --> 41:05.662
I like your hat.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.698
Thanks. I never
take it off.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
I know just
how that is.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.936
Tell me,
Allesandra Banks,

41:13.038 --> 41:14.137
are you married?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.439
No.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.876
Well, listen, you want
to see Mexico right

41:19.978 --> 41:21.978
you just give
me a call...

41:22.080 --> 41:26.449
and I'll show
you the town.

41:26.551 --> 41:30.119
Thanks. Thanks
so much. I will.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.088
Drive safe now.

41:32.190 --> 41:44.701
d

41:46.271 --> 41:54.143
d

42:03.154 --> 42:04.354
Thanks so
much, Sally.

42:04.456 --> 42:08.124
Oh, yeah, I am feeling
so much better today.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.526
Mm-hmm.

42:09.628 --> 42:12.829
Okay, so I will see you
at the meeting in 30.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.230
Door opening]

42:17.536 --> 42:20.136
Are you
Jessica Klint?

42:20.238 --> 42:22.338
Yes?

42:22.440 --> 42:24.307
Can we come
in, ma'am?

42:26.645 --> 42:28.311
Is this going to
take a while?

42:28.413 --> 42:30.947
I-I really need
to get to work.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.849
Ma'am, can you tell us
where you were last night

42:32.951 --> 42:35.518
between eight
and 10 o'clock?

42:35.620 --> 42:40.056
I was here.
At home, sick.

42:40.158 --> 42:43.893
What's this
all about?

42:43.995 --> 42:46.896
It's about your
father, ma'am.

42:46.998 --> 42:48.598
My father?

42:48.700 --> 42:54.037
He was killed...
last night...

42:54.139 --> 42:55.405
in a robbery.

43:08.019 --> 43:11.054
When was the last time
you saw your father?

43:11.156 --> 43:15.892
What? Um, I-I
don't know.

43:15.994 --> 43:17.393
Last time you
talked to him?

43:17.495 --> 43:24.033
Um, look, could
you please, please leave?

43:24.135 --> 43:26.369
I really just need to
be alone right now.

43:26.471 --> 43:28.538
Just a few more
questions, ma'am.

43:35.647 --> 43:37.380
We'll come back.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.889
Here's, uh,
my card...

43:46.992 --> 43:50.026
you need to
give me a call.

44:06.511 --> 44:07.844
Hello?

44:07.946 --> 44:14.817
<i>Hey. Um, did you</i>
<i> hear... about dad?</i>

44:14.919 --> 44:18.621
The cops were just
here. Bummer, right?

44:18.723 --> 44:23.092
<i>Allie! He- he</i>
<i> was our dad.</i>

44:23.194 --> 44:25.361
Listen, I didn't
like the poor bastard

44:25.463 --> 44:26.996
when he was alive,
I'm not gonna pretend

44:27.098 --> 44:29.365
to care about him
now that he's dead.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.367
You're so cold.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.774
Look, you didn't
tell the police

44:37.876 --> 44:40.243
anything about
last night, did you?

44:40.345 --> 44:42.011
Uh, no.

44:42.113 --> 44:45.515
Um, no, no, I told
them I was home sick.

44:45.617 --> 44:49.585
Wonderful. I really
need to go. So busy.

44:49.688 --> 44:53.022
I'll talk to you later,
darling. Bye bye.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.178
Jess... I'm
really sorry.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.414
Believe it or not, I
really liked the old man.

45:18.516 --> 45:20.216
Look, I really don't
want to hear it.

45:20.318 --> 45:21.350
Jess, please.

45:21.453 --> 45:23.252
You know what? Thanks to
you my last conversation

45:23.354 --> 45:25.254
with my father was
a fight over money.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.690
I just... just
leave me alone.

45:31.362 --> 45:34.330
Miss Klint?
Jessica, right?

45:34.432 --> 45:35.998
I'm sorry, it's
difficult for me to

45:36.101 --> 45:37.967
tell the difference
between you two.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.535
Yeah, what do you
want, detective?

45:39.637 --> 45:41.204
Uh, just a
couple questions.

45:41.306 --> 45:43.039
Um, let's see...

45:43.141 --> 45:46.776
you said that you
were sick on Thursday.

45:46.878 --> 45:48.578
How did you know
on Wednesday

45:48.680 --> 45:51.247
that you were going to
be sick on Thursday?

45:51.349 --> 45:53.683
What?
I-I didn't.

45:53.785 --> 45:57.153
Okay, well, we talked to
your husband and he said

45:57.255 --> 45:59.956
that you asked him
Wednesday to watch Danny

46:00.058 --> 46:03.326
so I'm kind of
wondering how you knew.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.762
I-I was gonna go to the
movies Thursday with

46:05.864 --> 46:07.797
my friend, Maddie,
and so I asked Lars

46:07.899 --> 46:10.500
to watch Danny and
then when I got sick

46:10.602 --> 46:14.737
I-I figured we should
just stick to the plan.

46:14.839 --> 46:17.540
Do you think
that I...?

46:17.642 --> 46:21.310
Oh, these are just
routine questions.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.079
Whenever there's a
murder in the family

46:23.181 --> 46:28.251
we have to, uh,
check in on everyone.

46:28.353 --> 46:32.155
Now, uh, one
last question.

46:32.257 --> 46:34.724
The maid,
her name was...?

46:34.826 --> 46:35.758
Maria.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.227
Maria... Yes.
Thank you.

46:38.329 --> 46:40.363
Now she
said the last time

46:40.465 --> 46:42.431
you and your father
saw each other

46:42.534 --> 46:44.634
you argued
over money.

46:44.736 --> 46:47.603
Mind telling me what
that money was for?

46:47.705 --> 46:51.574
Um, I was gonna
get a new car.

46:51.676 --> 46:53.509
Mine's kind of
beaten up and old.

46:53.611 --> 46:56.245
I guess you won't have
that problem anymore,

46:56.347 --> 46:57.880
will ya?

46:57.982 --> 47:00.316
How much do you and your
sister stand to inherit?

47:00.418 --> 47:01.584
I don't know.

47:01.686 --> 47:03.252
My sister's not
going to get anything.

47:03.354 --> 47:05.621
Dad cut her out of the
will a long time ago, so...

47:05.723 --> 47:07.223
Is that right?

47:07.325 --> 47:09.425
That entire bundle,
it's just going to you?

47:09.527 --> 47:11.761
Look, I honestly
don't know, detective.

47:11.863 --> 47:14.297
Okay, but last time
you saw your father

47:14.399 --> 47:17.133
he threatened to cut
you out as well, right?

47:17.235 --> 47:18.734
That was the
argument that...

47:18.837 --> 47:20.603
Daddy always threatened
when he was angry.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.705
Uh-huh. So you
don't think he ever

47:22.807 --> 47:24.273
got around
to doing it?

47:24.375 --> 47:25.908
I don't think that he
ever meant to, okay?

47:26.010 --> 47:27.710
I think it was
an empty threat.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.478
Is that all,
detective?

47:29.581 --> 47:32.348
That's it
for now.

48:08.453 --> 48:16.726
d

48:23.568 --> 48:25.635
Ugh, listen. If you
came to berate me about

48:25.737 --> 48:29.038
not going to the funeral
then just forget it.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.774
No, Allie, listen,
I'm worried, okay?

48:31.876 --> 48:33.910
the detective suspects
me of murdering dad.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.512
Oh, sweetheart, you
didn't do it, did you?

48:36.614 --> 48:37.813
What? No!

48:37.916 --> 48:39.815
Come on, you know
I was in Mexico.

48:39.918 --> 48:42.051
Well, then you have
nothing to worry about.

48:42.153 --> 48:45.688
Come on, Allie! I
don't have an alibi.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.590
What do you want
to do, Jess? Hmm?

48:47.692 --> 48:49.191
Do you want to tell
the police the truth

48:49.294 --> 48:51.527
and get us both
arrested for smuggling?

48:51.629 --> 48:52.695
No...

48:52.797 --> 48:55.197
Well, then don't be such
a silly bunny, all right?

48:55.300 --> 48:57.366
And besides, we made
a deal and I really

48:57.468 --> 48:59.936
expect you to hold
your side of the promise.

49:04.142 --> 49:06.208
Male voice: What
was that all about?

49:06.311 --> 49:08.311
Nothing. Don't
worry about it.

49:13.918 --> 49:18.421
Mmm, What is
your hurry, hmm?

49:37.675 --> 49:42.244
Maria, hi. Is
everything okay?

49:52.457 --> 49:57.326
Gracias, mija.
Hello, miss.

49:57.428 --> 49:59.528
Wait one minute,
I'll get my shawl.

49:59.630 --> 50:00.930
Yeah, sure.

50:09.307 --> 50:10.539
Maria, is
everything okay?

50:10.641 --> 50:13.242
You seemed so
upset on the phone.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.778
I saw you.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.513
What do
you mean?

50:17.615 --> 50:19.982
That night your
papa was murdered,

50:20.084 --> 50:23.986
I saw you in your car
going around the block.

50:24.088 --> 50:25.888
Maria, no,
that's ridiculous.

50:25.990 --> 50:27.723
Look, I don't
know what you saw,

50:27.825 --> 50:29.925
but it
wasn't me.

50:30.028 --> 50:33.729
Yes... that car
right there.

50:33.831 --> 50:36.298
There was someone
in it with you...

50:36.401 --> 50:39.402
before your papa went
out to take his walk.

50:39.504 --> 50:43.706
I was coming home
from the grocery store

50:43.808 --> 50:48.577
and I saw you get out of
the car on the next block.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.513
I was across
the street.

50:50.615 --> 50:51.981
Your car
started smoking

50:52.083 --> 50:54.050
and you got out and
looked at the motor.

50:54.152 --> 51:00.122
And I found this there
after you drove away.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.798
From where your
sweater got caught

51:08.900 --> 51:11.867
on the car when you
looked at the motor.

51:11.969 --> 51:15.638
No, Maria, listen.
You have to believe me.

51:15.740 --> 51:16.639
It wasn't me.

51:16.741 --> 51:18.441
Miss...

51:18.543 --> 51:22.745
It doesn't matter
what I believe,

51:22.847 --> 51:26.515
what matters is
what the police think.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.518
So then why are
you telling me?

51:29.620 --> 51:35.291
Your father, he was a
very cheap old man.

51:35.393 --> 51:42.364
I work for
him for 30 years.

51:42.467 --> 51:45.101
He didn't pay me
well when he was alive.

51:45.203 --> 51:48.170
I don't expect him to
now that he's dead.

51:52.710 --> 51:54.777
But you...

51:58.816 --> 52:08.257
you're going to be a
very rich lady now.

52:08.359 --> 52:10.126
If it's okay with you,
I'll skip the formalities

52:10.228 --> 52:12.561
and get right
to the bequests.

52:12.663 --> 52:19.935
Maria, he leaves you
10 thousand dollars.

52:20.037 --> 52:23.873
He set up a
trust for Danny,

52:23.975 --> 52:26.642
which, Jessica, you
and I will oversee.

52:26.744 --> 52:28.310
Mm-hmm.

52:28.412 --> 52:29.812
Allesandra...

52:29.914 --> 52:31.714
Oh, don't tell me
the old bastard

52:31.816 --> 52:33.349
actually
included me.

52:33.451 --> 52:36.452
He leaves you your
mother's pearl necklace,

52:36.554 --> 52:40.856
which he says is already
in your possession.

52:40.958 --> 52:43.225
And the bulk
of the estate,

52:43.327 --> 52:45.261
including various
properties and securities,

52:45.363 --> 52:47.329
goes to Jessica.

52:47.431 --> 52:49.198
It comes to
something in excess of

52:49.300 --> 52:51.267
10 million
dollars.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.349
I told you the old
man was a prick

53:07.451 --> 53:08.651
leaving me
just a necklace.

53:08.753 --> 53:10.853
I can't believe you hated
him enough to kill him.

53:10.955 --> 53:13.556
Jessica...
I didn't.

53:13.658 --> 53:18.894
Think what you want,
Jess, but just remember,

53:18.996 --> 53:21.497
you made
me a promise...

53:21.599 --> 53:26.335
and it would be bad
karma to break a promise.

53:26.437 --> 53:35.911
d

53:36.013 --> 53:38.948
That's some
story, Mrs. Klint.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.954
Or should I
believe you?

53:45.056 --> 53:46.422
According to
your sister,

53:46.524 --> 53:48.591
it was her who was
in Mexico, shopping,

53:48.693 --> 53:50.826
at the time
of the murder.

53:50.928 --> 53:52.294
Yeah, look, I know
that she says that,

53:52.396 --> 53:53.796
okay, but it was
me, alright?

53:53.898 --> 53:55.397
I was the one in
Mexico and I told her

53:55.499 --> 53:57.433
everything that
happened there.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.368
Well, is
there something

53:59.470 --> 54:04.240
you can verify...
something that happened

54:04.342 --> 54:06.976
that you didn't tell
her about in Mexico?

54:07.078 --> 54:09.245
I don't know.
She told me...

54:09.347 --> 54:11.547
she had me tell her
every single detail.

54:11.649 --> 54:12.881
Okay?

54:12.984 --> 54:15.985
I didn't understand
why at the time.

54:16.087 --> 54:17.820
There's got to
be something,

54:17.922 --> 54:20.856
something that you,
um, left out.

54:25.596 --> 54:26.829
No?

54:26.931 --> 54:28.597
Look, I don't know.

54:28.699 --> 54:35.671
Well, if you do
think of something...

54:35.773 --> 54:37.606
you know
where I am.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.375
Thank you.

54:44.715 --> 54:49.351
d

54:49.453 --> 54:50.486
There was
something.

54:50.588 --> 54:52.655
Listen, there was
a police officer that

54:52.757 --> 54:54.757
stopped me on my
way back from Mexico.

54:54.859 --> 54:58.027
It was, uh, around, uh,
it was probably around

54:58.129 --> 55:00.462
the same time my dad
was being murdered.

55:00.564 --> 55:02.498
Anyway, he stopped
me to give me my-

55:02.600 --> 55:04.166
or Allie's
ID back.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.934
And then he gave me
his phone number,

55:06.037 --> 55:08.037
he told me he'd show me
around Mexico sometime

55:08.139 --> 55:09.738
and I didn't
tell her that.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.840
Okay. Does the police
officer have a name?

55:11.942 --> 55:14.576
Um, God, I didn't think
I was going to call him.

55:14.679 --> 55:18.180
Um, he was tall, he
had a southern accent.

55:18.282 --> 55:21.850
His name was, um,
Bob... Bob something.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.086
Bob?

55:24.188 --> 55:28.524
And, uh, your sister
doesn't know anything

55:28.626 --> 55:29.825
about this guy?

55:29.927 --> 55:31.093
No.

55:31.195 --> 55:33.896
Uh, she does know that
an officer stopped me,

55:33.998 --> 55:36.131
but she doesn't know
that he asked me out.

55:36.233 --> 55:38.267
I never told
her that detail.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.948
Anything?
- Nope.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.016
Whoever it is, you must
have scared him away

56:28.119 --> 56:29.685
with the
pepper spray.

56:29.787 --> 56:30.819
Okay.

56:39.830 --> 56:42.297
Um, can I offer you
something to drink?

56:42.400 --> 56:44.466
Yeah, I'll take some
coffee if you got it.

56:44.568 --> 56:45.734
Sure.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.770
By the way, I
found your cowboy.

56:47.872 --> 56:48.904
Bob Smalley.

56:49.006 --> 56:50.773
Smalley! Yes!

56:50.875 --> 56:52.841
Yes, oh, what
did he say?

56:52.943 --> 56:54.510
He verified
what you said.

56:54.612 --> 56:56.145
I told you I
was in Mexico.

56:56.247 --> 56:57.613
You believe
me now, right?

56:57.715 --> 56:59.648
I don't know, I haven't
talked to your sister yet.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.816
Well, will you?

57:00.918 --> 57:01.650
Yeah. Of course.

57:01.752 --> 57:02.985
Now?

57:03.087 --> 57:04.153
It's a
little late.

57:04.255 --> 57:05.821
Please?

57:05.923 --> 57:09.158
Alright.
Okay. Yeah.

57:09.260 --> 57:11.093
Yeah, okay.
Okay, great. Okay.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.461
Where are
you going?

57:12.563 --> 57:13.729
I'm coming
with you.

57:21.872 --> 57:23.338
Well, well,
well, detective.

57:23.441 --> 57:24.706
What do we
have here?

57:24.809 --> 57:26.775
Got yourself a new
business partner?

57:26.877 --> 57:27.776
No, ma'am.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.978
I just need to clear
a couple things up.

57:30.080 --> 57:42.391
d

57:42.493 --> 57:47.463
Miss Banks, uh, both
you and your sister say

57:47.565 --> 57:50.399
that you were in Mexico
at the time of the murder.

57:50.501 --> 57:52.768
Now I have
Miss Klint's

57:52.870 --> 57:55.437
version of events
that night.

57:55.539 --> 57:56.905
Mmm.

57:57.007 --> 57:59.808
But I'm wondering...
is there anything

57:59.910 --> 58:01.710
that you
could tell me?

58:01.812 --> 58:04.079
Maybe something that
happened down there

58:04.181 --> 58:06.315
that she doesn't
know about?

58:06.417 --> 58:10.118
Hmm. Let
me think.

58:10.221 --> 58:15.190
Um, well, there
was a rude waiter,

58:15.292 --> 58:17.559
but I think I told
her about that.

58:17.661 --> 58:19.228
What about when
you crossed back

58:19.330 --> 58:21.063
over the border?

58:21.165 --> 58:26.201
Um, a police
officer stopped me.

58:26.303 --> 58:28.337
He returned
my ID.

58:28.439 --> 58:30.572
But I told her
about that, too.

58:30.674 --> 58:36.111
And this policeman, he,
uh, do anything unusual?

58:36.213 --> 58:38.247
Unusual? No.

58:46.524 --> 58:48.590
Unless you mean
his asking me out

58:48.692 --> 58:50.826
on a date, but I
don't think there's

58:50.928 --> 58:52.861
anything unusual
about that.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.134
He gave me
his number.

58:59.236 --> 59:01.937
Told me he wanted to
show me around sometime.

59:02.039 --> 59:03.605
You know, it's so funny
that you brought him up

59:03.707 --> 59:05.974
because I just got
off the phone with Bob.

59:06.076 --> 59:08.844
That's his name.
Bob Smalley.

59:08.946 --> 59:11.547
I'm going to take
him up on his offer.

59:11.649 --> 59:13.815
We're going out
this weekend.

59:13.918 --> 59:17.185
There's just something
about policemen

59:17.288 --> 59:33.168
that I find
so appealing.

59:47.885 --> 59:49.651
Quiet. I
have a knife.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.359
I'm going to
remove my hand.

59:57.461 --> 59:59.928
Just don't scream.

01:00:08.539 --> 01:00:09.871
Sorry to scare
you that way,

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.373
but I need to
talk to you.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.241
And I knew you'd
run the other way

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:14.576
if you saw
it was me.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:17.145
You got me pretty bad
with the mace earlier.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:19.548
Look, there's some things
we gotta talk about.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.750
Man, where
do I start?

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.654
That whole blackmail
thing in Texas,

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:28.457
your sister set that
whole thing up.

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.392
She cancelled your
reservation herself

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:32.995
and she told me
just how to play it.

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.998
She told me just
what you'd like.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.700
The thing is, though, she
promised me some money

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:41.036
and now she's trying
to back out of paying.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.438
I figure with the
new developments,

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.507
I got more chance
getting paid by you

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:49.244
if I help
you out.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:53.415
Okay, look, I'll
pay you the money

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.418
if you help me,
okay, but I just,

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.888
I just need to
know why did-

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.991
why did she want
you to blackmail me?

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:10.732
She knew you didn't
have the money to pay me

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:14.069
and that you'd do
anything to save your kid.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.937
That accidental meeting
with your friend at the

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.973
restaurant was no
coincidence either.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.608
She told me she
only wanted to

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.677
make up with you
and that the one way

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.712
to do that was to get
you to come to her.

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:25.247
That was the purpose
of the blackmail,

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.716
to get you to come
to her for money.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:31.086
So my husband
never hired you.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.755
No. I never even
met your husband.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.458
He didn't have a thing
to do with any of it.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.326
It was
all Allie.

01:01:38.429 --> 01:01:41.663
She put an ad online
for an actor wanted

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:44.099
and I answered.
Listen, hey, listen.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.635
I'm not a bad guy, but
I gotta get out of town.

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:48.370
When I agreed to
help your sister,

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:50.105
I didn't think anyone
was going to get hurt.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.673
I didn't know
about this whole

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:53.141
murder thing
until after.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.476
You helped
murder my dad?

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:55.644
No!

01:01:55.746 --> 01:02:00.048
No way. I helped
her with her alibi.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.552
I planted the video
cameras in the two hats.

01:02:03.654 --> 01:02:08.690
Video cameras?
In the hats?

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:12.294
That's what I
was smuggling.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.163
No, no, no, no.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.199
There was
no smuggling.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:22.604
It was just a way for her
to be two places at once.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:27.509
So she had an alibi
and I had nothing.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:30.278
And that's how
she knew...

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.781
That's how she knew
about everything.

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:37.352
Even the things
that I didn't tell her.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:38.787
Oh my, God.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:40.756
You know what?
Like it or not,

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:42.324
you are working
for me now.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.701
Okay, that's all the
money I have right now.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:54.536
I'll pay you the
rest after you

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.071
come with me
to the police.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.039
Whoa! No!
No police.

01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.107
Okay, then.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.010
Okay. Look,
I'll help you,

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:06.214
I just can't
go to the cops.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.617
I'm still
on probation.

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:14.089
And Allie still has
the original of this.

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:16.324
It's the tape she
made of that little

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:19.227
blackmail episode
in the park.

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:21.096
But that's perfect.
That's-that's the proof

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:23.131
that at least part
of my story is true.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:24.800
Sorry, I can't
let you have it.

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:28.236
It could land me
in jail again,

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:30.205
this time
for blackmail.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:34.075
But that was all part
of her setup. Right?

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:35.744
You were just
acting, Harry.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.246
It was still
blackmail.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:41.583
That tape doesn't
really prove much anyway.

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:45.153
Not about
the murder.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.556
Listen, if Allie still
trusts you I need you to

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:49.558
get something about
the murder on tape.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.459
Okay? Just get
her to admit it.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:55.864
It can't hurt to try.
I'm seeing her soon.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:58.600
But like I said,
it'll cost you.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.437
Okay.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:05.473
Okay, I'll get
you the money.

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.309
I even know where I
can get one of those

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:09.477
nanny cams on
short notice.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.482
Harry... thank
you so much.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.451
Listen, thank you.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.120
Thank you so much
for all of this.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:22.724
I knew you were a
better person than this.

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:38.773
d

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:41.443
I really appreciate
this, Maddie.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.511
I hope you're not too
late for your date.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:45.847
Oh, pfft, it's not a
problem. Just a sec.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.849
Let me grab it
from upstairs.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:55.991
This was
really helpful

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:57.959
getting me feedback
on my listings

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.662
until I found
out it's illegal.

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:02.664
Okay, great.
Where's the camera?

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:03.965
It's in its eyes.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.368
It actually records
straight to an SD card.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:07.502
Perfect.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:08.770
Thank you,
Maddie.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.505
Yeah, you
got it.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.540
Harry: Come
on, let's go.

01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:15.810
Are you sure you
can trust this guy?

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:17.712
No...

01:05:17.814 --> 01:05:20.181
I don't really
have another choice.

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:24.719
Um, listen, I-
I got this.

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.855
It's a recording of that
whole blackmail thing

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.456
in the park.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:29.724
Okay.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:31.559
Harry: Hey,
come on.

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:43.038
Okay,
here it is.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.906
You'll bring it by my
house when you're done?

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:46.107
Okay.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:14.502
You're late.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:15.870
Hey, doll.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.576
That's 'cause I stopped
to buy you something.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.278
A little gift.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.579
That?

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:25.847
Does this look
like something

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.916
that I
would like?

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:29.417
Give me a
break, Allie.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.785
I thought
it was cute.

01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.554
Then you
keep it.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:39.294
Come on, Allie...

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:42.197
He's cute.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:44.332
I thought you could
name him after me.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:52.040
So why did you have to
see me tonight, hmm?

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:54.642
If it's about the money,
I don't have it yet.

01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:56.411
No, baby, I
missed you.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.913
You've been
so busy lately.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.416
Yes, I have had a
lot on my mind.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.985
Yeah, this murder
thing, I know.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.820
Oh, you do,
do you? Hmm?

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:07.889
No, not
all of it.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:11.459
You never told me who
was in on it with you.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.096
Well, I already told you
more than you should know.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.499
But you're just
such a damn good lay.

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:27.008
Thank you so
much for coming.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:28.510
I knew you'd
believe me.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:29.844
Actually,
I don't.

01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:32.247
Honestly, this
whole thing sounds

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:33.948
pretty farfetched.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:37.786
Fake blackmail,
cameras in hats.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.354
I know, but it's
the truth, okay?

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.189
And I can prove it
to you and I will.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.690
He'll-he'll
be here soon.

01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:44.559
I don't think
he's coming.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.327
No, please.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.996
It's late.

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:49.330
Could you
just wait? I...

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:50.498
I'm sorry.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:55.103
Hold on,
this is him.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.105
Hi, Jess. I guess by
now you've figured out

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.807
I wasn't
coming over.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.875
Sorry, but I felt the
need to leave town fast.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:03.078
Oh, and, uh, thanks for
that money you gave me,

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.846
by the way. It's gonna
come in real handy.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:06.948
Honestly, I don't think
your plan to frame Allie

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.716
would have worked.
No one would believe

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:10.718
that story
we concocted.

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:12.520
But, hey, it was
great knowing you.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.089
And I hope you
get away with it.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.657
Oh, and here's
some footage of us

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.692
from last night to
remember me by.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.732
Oh, God, no.

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:26.533
That-that
wasn't last night.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.269
And everything
he said is a lie.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.437
Everything
is a lie.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.238
So you didn't pay him
to frame your sister?

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:35.710
No! I-I did pay him,
but it wasn't like that.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:36.845
Please,
believe me.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:39.214
I- Look, that video was
actually from Texas and

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:42.649
it proves actually that
I was telling the truth.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:45.319
No, what it does is it
proves you're lying.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.154
It proves that you
and him were in on it

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.756
from the beginning
to kill your father

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.091
and frame
your sister.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:52.493
No. I just...
I just...

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.296
let me think.
I just, um...

01:08:55.398 --> 01:08:56.798
There's
another tape.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:57.932
Oh.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.767
It was- Maddie made
it in the park

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.402
of the blackmail
and, I mean,

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:03.270
it corroborates my
story, you know.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.772
I left it with my
friend, Maddie, and

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.608
we could go to her
house right now and...

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.777
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:17.452
If I were you, I'd take
advantage of that right.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:31.064
and
door opening]

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:47.115
d

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:08.369
Jessica, how are
you? You okay?

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:12.473
Um, I don't know.
How's Danny?

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:13.942
He's fine.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:17.478
But it looks like the
courts are pushing

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.881
to grant me
full custody.

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:23.117
It's just with the
murder charges and all.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:28.790
I'm sorry, Jess.
It's not my doing.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.059
If the charges are
cleared, you'll have the

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:34.262
opportunity to apply
for joint custody.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:56.517
You're a good mother,
Jess. And he loves you.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.152
When all is
said and done,

01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:01.522
I do want you to
be part of his life.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.024
But for now,
let's focus on

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:05.059
solving your
immediate problem.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.632
Danny will be
fine with me.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.333
Jess, why didn't
you let me know

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.535
you were in
trouble earlier?

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:16.704
I could have
helped you.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:19.007
I thought you were
behind it all, Lars.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:21.709
Allie convinced me
that you were the one

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.678
blackmailing me
and I didn't realize

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.481
that she was
setting us both up.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.082
I guess I
deserve that.

01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:30.151
The way I've treated
you since you left me.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:31.552
No.

01:11:31.655 --> 01:11:34.489
I'm not
proud of it.

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.991
You know, Allie
predicted my every single

01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:39.794
stupid move and I just-
I don't understand why.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:45.500
It's simple, Jess.
For the money.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:48.336
No, Lars, she
doesn't inherit at all.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.837
She does.

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:52.173
If you're convicted of
your father's murder

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:54.976
you can't profit from
it. That's the law.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:57.445
So in that case, since
Allie wasn't specifically

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.181
disinherited she'd
likely get everything.

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:02.984
She'd be what's called
a pretermitted heir.

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:05.887
If you're convicted,
she will get your

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.222
whole share
of the estate.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.058
Okay, okay, well
that's it, right?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.526
That's her
motive, okay,

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:12.994
we have to go
tell the police.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.495
Please, go tell
the police that.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:18.232
It would help if you
had some kind of proof.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:22.236
Right now,
Allie has an alibi

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:24.205
for the time
of the murder.

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:26.941
Wait...

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.243
There's something.

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:31.746
It's not much,
but it might help.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.515
There's the tape that
Allie made in the park.

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:36.617
Listen, Allie denies
the whole blackmail thing

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.886
ever happened.
Right?

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.389
So at least it's
some sort of proof

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:43.424
that she was
lying about that.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.592
Where's the tape?

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.194
Maddie has it.

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:48.463
What?

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:50.131
I'm just
concerned...

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:53.334
It's obvious Allie's
in this with someone

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:55.269
who knows you
pretty well.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:56.404
Not Maddie.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.973
Who else, Jess?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.842
From what you've told
me, she's urged you

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:03.244
to fall into every
one of Allie's traps.

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:04.612
To go have sex
at the conference.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.281
To go to
Allie for help,

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:08.916
but then to tell
the policeman

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:11.419
that you were lying
about being home sick.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.524
Well, first
thing's first.

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:20.595
We have to
get you bail.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:24.699
She committed the
most heinous of crimes.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:27.301
The murder of her own
father just for money.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.470
She clearly has no
conscience, your honor.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.406
She's capable
of anything.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.775
Also, the police, in
searching her residence,

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.978
found a faked passport
and two tickets to Brazil

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080
for herself
and her son.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.482
She's clearly a strong
flight risk and I strongly

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:44.652
propose for a
motion to deny bail.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:47.255
What? no, there
were no passports.

01:13:47.357 --> 01:13:48.790
She's lying.

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:51.359
That, or Allie
planted something.

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:54.829
Your Honor, my
client has strong ties

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.031
to the community.
She's a good mother

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.132
with a good job.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:00.134
She's been framed
for this murder.

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:01.602
Please, save
it for the trial.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:03.604
Judge, I personally will
take responsibility

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:06.140
to see she remains
in town until her trial.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.109
Owing to the fact that
she had airplane tickets

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.545
in her possession, she
is clearly a flight risk.

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:13.147
I am
denying bail.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.652
You have to get
that tape from Maddie.

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:33.701
d

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:36.671
I got it.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.073
I haven't had a chance
to listen to it yet,

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:41.175
but I guess I was
wrong about her.

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:43.377
She does seem really
concerned about you.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.579
Okay.

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.658
No, this has- this has got
to be the wrong tape, Lars.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.759
You got the wrong...

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:11.772
No! It's got to
be here somewhere.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.612
How could she
do this to me?

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:26.320
Oh,
God, I can't!

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:29.457
I can't do this, Lars!
I can't do this!

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:47.642
Female voice:
Well?

01:15:47.744 --> 01:15:49.176
We got her.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:50.878
She thinks Maddie's
in on it with you

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.813
and now I'm
her only ally.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:54.482
No pun intended.

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:56.150
I told you it
would work out.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:57.818
Yeah. Unless
Maddie comes up

01:15:57.921 --> 01:15:59.954
with another
copy of that tape.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.223
Oh, please, we'll deal
with it if that happens.

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.358
And besides, even if
there is another copy,

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.427
you know Jessica's
not going to let Maddie

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:07.995
anywhere
near her.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:09.697
If there's one
thing Jess is good at

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:10.898
it's holding
a grudge.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.267
So you see,
it's perfect.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:15.870
Yeah. But that actor
friend of yours, Harry,

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:17.705
almost screwed
us up royally.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.173
True.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.576
But he ended up being
a big help, didn't he?

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.010
So what's next?

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.179
We wait. She's bound
to be convicted

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.481
if she doesn't
kill herself first.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.884
Sounds good.
Dinner?

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:32.386
Great.
I'm starving.

01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:48.903
d

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:50.771
Hi, I'm
Madeline Walters.

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:52.740
I'm here to see
Jessica Klint.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:54.909
Sorry, Miss
Walters,

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:57.712
she said she doesn't
want to see you.

01:16:57.814 --> 01:16:59.614
Wh-why not?

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.315
I don't know.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.456
I was told you
needed to see me.

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:09.890
I think I have
some new evidence.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.359
But I need
your help.

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:13.227
Look, detective, you
don't want to keep

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:15.396
an innocent person
in jail, right?

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:17.531
Look, you tried to prove
that your sister did it

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.233
and you couldn't.

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.469
So unless I see
this new evidence...

01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:22.770
No, detective...

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.538
Detective, please.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.607
Listen, I think
that it exists.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:28.776
But I need your
help to get it

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.411
before it's
destroyed.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.983
Yeah?

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:38.753
<i>Madeline Walters</i>
<i> is here to see you.</i>

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.921
Send her in.

01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:43.724
Maddie...
How are you?

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.760
Have you been
to see Jess yet?

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:47.461
She could really use
a friend like you

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:48.629
right now.

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.931
Cut the crap, Lars, I
know what's going on.

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:53.467
And I took the liberty of
calling Allesandra here.

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:55.302
Hope you
don't mind.

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:56.904
What's this about?

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:01.676
It's about this.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:04.679
I know you erased
the copy I gave you.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.815
Good thing I made a
few more copies, huh?

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:09.450
That ridiculous
blackmail tape

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.118
doesn't prove
a thing.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.320
So Jess slept with
some guy who tried to

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:15.289
blackmail her
in the park.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.724
I have nothing
to do with that.

01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:18.959
It proves to Jessica
that I didn't erase it.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:20.361
You did.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:22.430
And that you and Allie
are in this together.

01:18:22.532 --> 01:18:24.632
At least some of what
she's been claiming

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:25.733
is true.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:28.302
No one will believe her
about the rest anyway.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.971
Maybe...
Maybe not.

01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:34.642
Are you willing to
take that chance?

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:37.011
What is it
you want?

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:42.016
Hmm, I think about
five hundred thousand

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.751
ought to be
sufficient.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.619
I don't have that
kind of money to spare.

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:47.955
You will. Once
Jess is convicted

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.590
her inheritance
will go to Allie.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.625
You'll have a lot
more than that.

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:53.661
Why shouldn't I get in
on some of the action?

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:55.730
I mean, Jess already
thinks that I am.

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:57.631
This is the reward
after all these years

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:58.899
of friendship?

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.468
You know what?
screw her.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:03.671
And screw you,
too. Look at me.

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:06.674
It's the money
or the cops.

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:09.343
Yeah?

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:11.679
<i>I have Allesandra</i>
<i> Banks in the lobby.</i>

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:13.247
Send her in.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.325
Maddie is trying
to blackmail us.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.761
She has a copy of
the cassette tape.

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:28.095
How much does
she want?

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:29.663
It doesn't matter. The
more I think about it

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:31.732
I don't think it
proves anything.

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:33.801
It proves that I
lied to the police.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.403
And how about when
they find Harry's body?

01:19:36.506 --> 01:19:37.772
They'll tie him
back to us.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:39.573
We know we killed
him, but they don't.

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:40.708
A body's
a body.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.009
With no
forensic evidence,

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.444
they can't
prove anything.

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:44.578
So just
say nothing

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.747
and it'll be our
little secret.

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:48.682
She might
be taping this

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:50.651
so let me do
all the talking.

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:52.720
Fine.

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:53.888
Allesandra.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.356
Maddie.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:59.493
I don't think we have
much more to discuss.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:02.429
That tape you have
doesn't prove anything.

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.732
Your little blackmail
scheme, your attempt

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:07.935
to frame Allie
and me won't work.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:09.570
Give the tape
to Jess...

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:12.406
if she'll even
see you, that is.

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:19.613
Jessica, wow, you're
quite dressed up today.

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:20.915
What's the
occasion?

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:22.183
I'm Allie,
you fool.

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:25.219
What, you were in here with
your wife the whole time,

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.388
you didn't even
recognize her? Idiot.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.624
I just hope you didn't
say anything stupid.

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.227
Actually, he did.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.663
He confessed to
murdering poor Harry.

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:37.598
They didn't
have any proof!

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.934
Well, we
do now.

01:20:40.036 --> 01:20:41.735
Right, detective?

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:43.904
Oh, yeah.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.006
Thank you so much.
You were great.

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:48.409
You got it,
sweetheart.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.544
And thank
you, detective,

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.981
for convincing the DA
to let me out to do this.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.282
Well, like
you said,

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:59.453
we can't go putting
the wrong people in jail.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:01.755
Come on, put your
hands behind your back.

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:02.990
Come on.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.792
Counselor,
stay right there.

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:09.129
You stupid bitch!
You got everything.

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:10.497
We set the
whole thing up

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.700
and then you get
10 million dollars?

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:14.134
Give me a
break, Allie.

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:16.670
You put me
through hell.

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:18.739
You're a greedy
woman and you deserve

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:20.975
everything that
you're getting.

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:26.747
"Can we have some,
too?" they cried.

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:29.316
"Of course you can.
Everyone can have some".

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:31.652
The children jumped onto
the truck and they rode

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:34.922
off into the sunset and
lived happily ever after.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:38.158
Okay, buddy, it's
time for you to go to...

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:41.662
..sleep.

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:53.841
d

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:55.676
I love you.

01:21:55.778 --> 01:22:00.014
d

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:02.149
Hey.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.218
Hey.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.488
So how's he dealing
with the fact

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:10.024
his father's
going to prison?

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:12.826
It's hard on him,
but he'll be okay.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:15.229
I'm going to
make sure of that.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.036
What?

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:25.205
What is it?

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:29.009
No, it's just the
way you said that,

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.512
for a second you
sounded like your sister.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:32.947
Yeah, it's
funny, you know.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:35.549
In the past, Allie was
always the tough one,

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:37.685
the one with
street smarts

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:40.821
and I was the
risk averse one.

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:44.591
Desperate times call
for desperate measures,

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:45.626
right?

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:56.603
Well, if you, uh,
ever need a hand

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:59.640
I'd like to be
there for you.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:07.748
I think that's
really sweet, detective.

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.718
But right now I just need
to be alone for a while.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.153
You know, I've got
bigger priorities.

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:19.293
Well, you need me you
know where to find me.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:22.262
Yeah.

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:24.765
Thanks for the coffee.
