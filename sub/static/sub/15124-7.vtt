WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.105
Well, it's that time
of year again.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.175
The town of Natesville,
famous for its rich soil

00:07.208 --> 00:08.642
that for reasons unknown

00:08.676 --> 00:11.545
produces the plumpest radishes
in the world,

00:11.579 --> 00:12.613
is celebrating

00:12.646 --> 00:15.683
its annual Thanksgiving Radish
Harvest Festival.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.085
Natesville!

00:17.118 --> 00:18.152
Hey, stop doing that.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.421
Not only is the festival
an opportunity

00:20.454 --> 00:23.691
for Natesville residents
to show off their radishes,

00:23.724 --> 00:26.694
it's also an opportunity
to show off the radish's

00:26.727 --> 00:31.099
many uses as a food, a garnish
and as a projectile.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.401
Oh!

00:33.434 --> 00:35.536
What?

00:35.569 --> 00:38.372
Winner, winner,
Thanksgiving radish dinner.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.075
The festival also offers
small business owners

00:41.109 --> 00:44.745
who are afraid of the Internet
the opportunity to advertise.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.081
Knock Knock Knock
Housekeeping.

00:47.115 --> 00:50.718
Call the gals in pink
to remove your stink.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.686
This week-long event also gives

00:52.720 --> 00:55.689
some of the city's unsung
and unpaid heroes

00:55.723 --> 00:57.358
their day in the sun.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.726
BARNEY:
Today's security is provided

00:58.759 --> 01:00.361
by the Natesville
Auxiliary Police.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.596
This year the mall cops
loaned us their Segways,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.532
and the high school
donated whistles.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.268
(whistles loudly)

01:07.301 --> 01:09.103
So, if you miss it this year,

01:09.137 --> 01:11.205
make sure you get here next year

01:11.239 --> 01:13.541
so the people
of Natesville can...

01:13.574 --> 01:16.877
ALL:
Show you our radishes!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.379
I'm Dave Davidson,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.781
and this has been
"Where the Heck Is Dave Today?"

01:20.814 --> 01:22.816
Natesville!

01:25.819 --> 01:27.455
Whoo!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.123
* Here we go

01:29.157 --> 01:32.460
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:34.928 --> 01:37.398
(groans)

01:37.431 --> 01:39.400
This ice cream
is disgusting.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.136
The radish is not a
desserty vegetable.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.304
Hey.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.672
Hey.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.806
You know our
daughter, Annette?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.841
And this is our grandson,
June Bug.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.177
(pops)

01:49.210 --> 01:50.844
Look at you with a
kid of your own

01:50.878 --> 01:51.812
throwing explosives.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.648
(pops)
Seems like it was
just yesterday

01:54.682 --> 01:56.184
we were at this
same festival

01:56.217 --> 01:58.286
(pops)
watching you and Jimmy
play with fireworks.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.187
(pops)

01:59.220 --> 02:00.454
BARNEY:
Radish revelers,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.290
can I have your attention,
please?

02:02.323 --> 02:04.158
No.

02:04.192 --> 02:07.628
(whistles)
Over here, on the stage.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.763
Before I bring out this
year's entertainment,
(pops)

02:09.797 --> 02:12.333
Allman Skynyrd,
a patchwork of survivors

02:12.366 --> 02:14.302
from Lynyrd Skynyrd
and the Allman Brothers,

02:14.335 --> 02:17.338
I have an announcement
about the annual candy drive.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.673
Now, as always,
it's you kids of Natesville

02:19.707 --> 02:22.243
that raise the money
for this wonderful festival.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.312
The child who sells
the most candy

02:24.345 --> 02:25.846
gets to be the little pilgrim

02:25.879 --> 02:27.881
in the "We're Thankful
for Radishes"
(pops)

02:27.915 --> 02:29.683
Thanksgiving Day float.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.885
Yeah, I was the
little pilgrim once.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.388
Are you kidding me?
Nah.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.190
If you would have played
the little pilgrim card

02:36.224 --> 02:37.458
when we first met,

02:37.491 --> 02:39.260
you would've gotten
in my pants a lot sooner.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.696
It did get me a couple of
kisses on the playground.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.565
It was the first time
in my life

02:44.598 --> 02:45.899
that I ever achieved anything.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.301
I felt special.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.903
Everyone was looking up to me,
and I made the most of it.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.873
I win, you lose,
I win, you lose.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.509
(blows raspberries)

02:57.878 --> 02:59.547
Now I want Hope to feel
the way I felt that day.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.349
It could be just the boost
her self-esteem needs

03:01.382 --> 03:02.883
to finally get
her potty-trained.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.385
Oh, that would be good.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.686
I think she's starting
to understand

03:05.719 --> 03:07.555
that squatting behind the couch
and grunting

03:07.588 --> 03:08.722
is losing its charm.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.823
BARNEY:
Candy sale pickup

03:09.857 --> 03:11.692
is now... open!

03:12.393 --> 03:14.194
Go, go, go!

03:21.435 --> 03:22.536
Look at them.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.372
I'm glad we're grandparents.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.241
Yep, selling candy
is a young parent's game.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.243
Glad I'm retired
from all this candy madness.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.380
(pops)

03:32.413 --> 03:34.582
June Bug, not
at the head.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.783
(yelling)

03:35.816 --> 03:37.685
Hey, hey, it's Jimmy!
Give me.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.786
Oh, hell no.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.854
People, people,
show some decorum.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.890
This is the Radish Festival.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.859
The world is watching.
The world is watching!

03:45.893 --> 03:46.927
(screaming)

03:46.960 --> 03:48.796
(groans)

03:48.829 --> 03:50.764
Take it easy, Hope.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.766
Grandpa spent a lot of money
trying to win that horse.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.568
Don't pull Trigger's
ear off, okay?

03:54.602 --> 03:55.969
I think she named it Clip Clop.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.638
Well, Trigger hates that name.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.740
How many bars do you think
we need to sell so Hope

03:59.773 --> 04:01.775
can be the little pilgrim
and ride on the radish float?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.711
I don't know,
and if I were you,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.446
I wouldn't get too invested
in her winning.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.914
But she has to win.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.749
Look, I want her
to feel like I did.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.884
I mean, it gave me the
confidence to go after

04:10.918 --> 04:12.653
things that
seemed impossible.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.921
Like grow Ricky Radish.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.557
Or Sabrina.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.658
Oh, thank you.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.660
I meant Sabrina Squash.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.964
Well, that's humbling.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.368
Anyway, I hear you guys
are candy-selling pros.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.736
You have any tips for us?

04:28.769 --> 04:29.670
No, absolutely not.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.904
We cannot get involved
with this. No way.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.840
Why?
Don't ask questions.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.308
What's the big deal? Why?
Shh.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.776
No, please.
(muffled talking)

04:35.809 --> 04:37.645
Stop. No.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.380
Shh.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.848
Mmm.
Why can't you help?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.651
MAW MAW:
Just tell him.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.387
What are you doing in there?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.456
I was hoping the cabinet
would transport me

04:48.489 --> 04:51.459
to a magical place
where none of you existed.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.393
How's that working out?

04:52.426 --> 04:53.994
Not well and we have mice.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.396
Just tell the boy.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.365
It's better coming from you.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.501
Wha...

05:00.534 --> 05:02.703
Fine, but I'm warning you,

05:02.736 --> 05:05.339
this family did things
we are ashamed of.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.511
Things you're gonna wish
you didn't know about.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.013
(grunting)

05:13.046 --> 05:15.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
this sounds like a great story.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.717
Do you guys have any popcorn?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.819
It's on top of the cupboard.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.494
Hey, remember that tall girl
you dated in high school?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.995
What's her name?
Rachel.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.497
That's right.
Rachel.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.331
Wonder what
she's up to.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.370
What I am about
to tell you

05:36.404 --> 05:38.005
never leaves this room.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.409
It all happened 20 years ago
at the Radish Festival.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.512
I had just started working at
Knock Knock Knock Housekeeping.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.380
(pops)

05:53.921 --> 05:56.390
(pops)

05:56.424 --> 05:57.858
Ladies and gentlemen,
please excuse my sweating.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.761
It must be at least
70 degrees out here.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.397
Now, remember, if you don't want
next year's entertainment

06:03.431 --> 06:06.033
to be me covering
Blues Traveler's songs again,

06:06.066 --> 06:08.736
we're gonna need every child
to participate

06:08.769 --> 06:10.170
in the candy drive.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.772
So what do you say, parents?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.073
Come and get this candy.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.844
Look at them.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.811
You know those
crazy parents

06:17.845 --> 06:19.880
will be selling the
candy for their kids.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.849
Which will teach
the kids nothing.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.751
I guarantee you,
20 years from now,

06:23.784 --> 06:25.453
those brats
will still be living at home.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.588
Rosa and I were speaking
the same language,

06:27.621 --> 06:28.856
even though she had
a funny accent.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.758
We both agreed
that we wouldn't be

06:30.791 --> 06:32.426
the kind of parents
who do everything

06:32.460 --> 06:33.627
for their kids.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
It's hot. Can I get in?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.433
Have you sold any candy?

06:39.467 --> 06:40.934
Not yet.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.471
Sorry, kid.
No cash, no splash.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.805
Kiddie pool's for closers.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.641
Oh, come on, can't you help me?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.877
I want to be the little pilgrim.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.579
Sorry, hon, no can do.
(ice cream truck music playing)

06:51.612 --> 06:52.846
We're doing this
for your own good.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.782
Work builds character.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.983
Ooh.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.551
I'm gonna see
if Rosa and Carlos

06:57.585 --> 06:58.786
will give us
some free Astro Pops.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.153
Count me in. I want one.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.589
Me, too.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.592
Sorry kid,
Astro Pops are for closers.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.796
Hey!

07:08.829 --> 07:09.897
I thought we said we weren't

07:09.930 --> 07:11.499
gonna help them sell chocolate.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.967
Andale, ándale, ándale!

07:18.205 --> 07:19.540
Jimmy, remember
how we said we were

07:19.573 --> 07:22.743
finally gonna take you to the
movies tonight to see Aladdin?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.545
Yeah!

07:24.578 --> 07:25.746
Well, that's off.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.948
We're going to war.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.984
JIMMY:
You guys suck at this.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.686
VIRGINIA:
We tried.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.488
We went to every house
in the neighborhood,

07:34.522 --> 07:35.923
but no one even answered
the door.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.526
Those crazy religious people
ruined it for everyone.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.927
The problem isn't you, Virginia.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.629
It's those crummy candy bars.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.196
Just 'cause they're brown
and filled with nuts

07:43.230 --> 07:44.898
doesn't mean they need
to taste like crap.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.934
Don't worry.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.335
Maw Maw's got an idea.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.907
VIRGINIA:
It was time for us
to bring out the big guns.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.145
So Maw Maw started

07:58.178 --> 08:00.581
whipping up a batch
of her own special chocolate.

08:02.983 --> 08:07.588
Of course, she only used
the finest of ingredients.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.903
There were plenty of people
in the confection game,

08:22.936 --> 08:24.738
but what made her cocoa so loco

08:24.772 --> 08:27.174
was her secret ingredient,

08:27.207 --> 08:29.242
bacon drippings.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.693
She had created
the most delicious

08:45.726 --> 08:47.761
and addictive food
known to man.

08:47.795 --> 08:51.098
We called it
Maw Maw's Magic Brown.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.605
Once people got a taste,
word spread.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.839
Everyone was hooked.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.875
(ice cream truck music plays)

09:03.777 --> 09:06.647
And that started
a major turf war.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.125
Burt!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.805
They hit us,

09:31.839 --> 09:33.641
but we hit them back harder.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.956
(grunting)

10:04.838 --> 10:07.708
(screams)

10:07.741 --> 10:08.776
When the dust had settled

10:08.809 --> 10:10.711
and the candy was gone,

10:10.744 --> 10:12.345
it was time to count up
the earnings

10:12.379 --> 10:13.947
and see who was gonna ride
that float.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.083
Well,

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
quite a lot of chimmies
in those changas.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.821
Looks like Rosa's the winner.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.755
Hold on.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.924
I've got this contest

10:23.957 --> 10:25.693
in the bag.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.728
Or should I say,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.763
bags?

10:29.797 --> 10:32.833
That was Burt's line,
but I think he stole it

10:32.866 --> 10:34.702
from an episode of MacGyver.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.804
Seeing Jimmy up on that float
made me feel proud

10:36.837 --> 10:38.772
that we were able to win
the contest for him.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.007
He was so happy.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.444
But then I realized that
even though Jimmy was happy,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.280
we made another child very sad,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.349
and all of a sudden,
I didn't feel so good.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.052
At that moment,
Rosa and I both realized

10:52.085 --> 10:55.689
there are no winners
in a candy war.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.226
And there's been peace
between the families ever since.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.729
So if you want Hope
to ride on that float,

11:01.762 --> 11:03.063
you're gonna have to do it
without our help.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.332
Fine. I'll do it on my own.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.800
We need to call a plumber.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.769
The toilet in here won't flush.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.306
I thought you said "cookie."

11:13.340 --> 11:14.842
It sounded like
you said "cookie."

11:14.875 --> 11:17.978
Why would I say,
"If we hurry,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.747
we can have a cookie
in the shower"?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.414
Doesn't even make sense.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.816
That's why I said no.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.117
Damn, never get
that one back.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.722
Rosa?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.390
Andale, ándale, ándale!

11:31.391 --> 11:33.393
Andale, ándale, ándale!

11:35.763 --> 11:37.898
Rosa's back in the candy game!

11:37.931 --> 11:39.900
She and Carlos
are selling chocolate bars

11:39.933 --> 11:40.834
out of their
ice cream truck.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.904
That dirty, lying,
chocolate-slinging ho!

11:43.937 --> 11:46.506
Fire up the Bunsen burner.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.377
We're gonna drop some
cocoa madness on those chumps.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.455
JIMMY:
Once we learned Rosa was back
to dealing candy bars,

12:02.489 --> 12:04.792
we knew our only chance at
getting Hope to win the contest

12:04.825 --> 12:07.761
was to pull Maw Maw
out of retirement.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.097
*

12:35.856 --> 12:38.926
*

12:58.011 --> 13:00.814
When Maw Maw's recipe
hit the streets,

13:00.848 --> 13:04.084
the Chance family
was back on top.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.120
(ice cream truck music plays)

13:08.889 --> 13:09.823
When Rosa's family knew

13:09.857 --> 13:11.992
we were back in business,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.561
things got rough.
(muffled yelling)

13:20.133 --> 13:21.935
Let this be a lesson.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.104
Don't screw
with the Flores family.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.839
(glass breaking)

13:27.640 --> 13:30.844
JIMMY:
And we weren't gonna
take that lying down.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.100
(off-key violins playing)

13:54.334 --> 13:55.568
(screaming)

14:00.073 --> 14:02.209
As sticky as things
were getting on the streets,

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
things were starting
to melt on the inside, too.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.017
Are you boosting?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.985
Come on.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.420
I need it. I just...

14:13.453 --> 14:15.923
We've been working all night,
and I-I need the energy.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.025
Plus they're just...
they're so good.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.427
Bitch, you know we don't
get high on our own supply.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.596
Oh!

14:23.630 --> 14:25.365
JIMMY:
While we were
fighting mayhem at home,

14:25.398 --> 14:28.468
the Flores cartel decided
to hit us where it really hurt.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.428
(screaming)

15:01.734 --> 15:03.436
Maw Maw stepped things up

15:03.470 --> 15:05.138
by making the chocolate
even stronger.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.907
Nobody could resist
our latest strain.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.981
(moaning)

15:19.052 --> 15:21.321
Come on, man,
just give me some chocolate.

15:21.354 --> 15:25.092
A chunk, a section,
a little bitty square.

15:25.125 --> 15:25.993
I can't do it, Frank.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.395
Barney said I can't
sell in the store.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.263
Barney also said,
if I just wander around

15:30.297 --> 15:32.432
doing nothing all day,
he'll fire me.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.666
That was ten years ago.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.734
Give me some.
I know you're holding.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.269
Hey, get out of there.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.604
Stop it.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.239
Get out. No, no, no, no.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.508
What do we have here?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.080
(sniffs)

15:50.150 --> 15:51.484
That's Maw Maw's Magic Brown.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.986
It's back on the street?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.990
James, my office now!

15:57.024 --> 15:58.091
Frank,

15:58.125 --> 16:00.693
if you don't stop wandering
around, I'll fire you.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.433
"You have been detained

16:06.466 --> 16:08.001
"by a Natesville auxiliary
police officer.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.702
"You have the right
to remain silent.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.705
"You also have the right
to leave at any point

16:12.739 --> 16:13.573
"because said auxiliary officer

16:13.606 --> 16:16.109
has no legal authority
to detain you."

16:16.143 --> 16:17.510
Wait, so I can just leave?

16:17.544 --> 16:20.147
Not if you ever want
your daughter to ride on top

16:20.180 --> 16:22.382
of the "We're Thankful
for Radishes" float.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.084
Oh, Barney, come on.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.353
Don't make Hope suffer just
because you have a beef with me.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.188
Oh, this has nothing
to do with you.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.057
You're small potatoes.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.158
I want the russet.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.159
The what?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.793
The russet.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.794
It's the king of potatoes.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.729
How do you work in produce
and not know that?

16:36.763 --> 16:39.066
Fine. I'll go get you a potato.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.100
I don't want a potato.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.105
I want your mother.

16:46.273 --> 16:49.209
20 years ago, your mother
and I had a run-in.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.178
Hold on.
I've got this contest

16:51.211 --> 16:53.113
in the bag.

16:53.146 --> 16:57.050
Or should I say, bags?

17:02.122 --> 17:03.723
Wow, this is a lot of money,
Virginia.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.325
How'd you sell so much candy?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.794
Guess I just have
a knack for it.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.830
I find that hard to believe.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.101
Yeah, well, I find it hard
to believe that an aspirin

17:14.134 --> 17:18.438
just knows when I've got
a pain in my neck, but it does.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.240
Got any aspirin?

17:20.273 --> 17:22.675
Aisle two.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.411
I was darn sure
your mother cheated,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.546
and like any good
auxiliary police officer,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.848
I was gonna keep the pressure
on until she admitted it.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.782
You cheated.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.518
Prove it.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.520
And over the years,
I've never let it go.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.088
You cheated!

17:35.122 --> 17:35.722
Prove it.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.457
You cheated.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.591
Prove it.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.593
Knock Knock Knock Housekeeping.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.728
You cheated.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.862
Prove it.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.299
So, James, I guess the radish
is in your basket now.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.268
How do you want to play it?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.102
Barney, please.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.138
Don't make me rat out
my own mom.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.639
Snitches get stitches.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.374
I'm not asking you
to be a snitch.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.143
I'm asking you
to do what's best

17:56.176 --> 17:57.744
for you and your daughter.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.746
You want her to be
the little pilgrim, don't you?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.248
What do I have to do?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.250
I don't have to beat up
my own mom, do I?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.285
Absolutely not.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.156
You are gonna wear a wire.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.595
(over P.A.):
You cheated.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.331
Prove it!

18:18.365 --> 18:20.167
Oh, I will.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.469
I finally will.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.849
(door closes)

18:38.718 --> 18:40.587
JIMMY:
Back at the chocolate factory,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.789
things were really
out of control.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.258
Hopped up on chocolate,

18:45.292 --> 18:47.160
nobody had slept for days.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.363
And everyone was going
more than a little crazy.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.864
You weren't followed
here, were you?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.301
I think Rosa's got ties
to the Mexican Air Force.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.835
Listen, you hear that?

18:55.868 --> 18:56.903
Choppers!

18:59.339 --> 19:00.840
I don't see them.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.676
I think they've been camouflaged
to look like the sky.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.312
They invented the chalupa.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.914
How hard can the
invisible helicopter be?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.318
How's it going, Mom?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.253
Oh, damn it, Jimmy,
I was up to four,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.188
and now I've got
to start all over again.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.856
Chopper! I see one.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.791
It looks just like a bird.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.328
Yeah, sorry to
interrupt you

19:21.361 --> 19:23.630
from counting money from
our current candy sales,

19:23.663 --> 19:24.964
which we have gotten
by cheating

19:24.997 --> 19:27.567
when we added a secret
addictive ingredient

19:27.600 --> 19:29.969
to the chocolate bar.
Get out of my face.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.839
JIMMY:
So I have to push the big button
and the little red button?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.474
BARNEY:
The little red button
is inside the big button.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.376
JIMMY:
Oh, I'm doing it right now.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.745
He's wearing a wire.
He's wearing a wire!

19:38.778 --> 19:41.348
It's the.... (groans)

19:41.381 --> 19:42.715
You're gonna talk, Jimmy.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.850
Who gave you the wire?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.985
Ow, you got chocolate
in my eye.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.520
You're ruining a good
thing here, Jimmy.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.356
Tell us where
that wire came from.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.258
Tell us!
We're not playing around.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.400
(motor hums)

20:08.375 --> 20:09.609
Ricky!

20:11.944 --> 20:13.780
It was Barney.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.915
He told me
he'd rig the contest

20:15.948 --> 20:17.884
so that Hope
could be the little pilgrim

20:17.917 --> 20:20.253
if I helped him prove you've
been cheating all these years.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.023
Why didn't you
just tell us that, you idiot?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.592
The only reason
we've been doing this

20:25.625 --> 20:26.926
is to get Hope on that float.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.795
Oh.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.897
HOPE:
Potty.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.033
Come on, sweetie.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.303
Get comfy.
All right, sweetie.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.938
Daddy is so proud.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.942
(splashing)

20:42.975 --> 20:45.645
ALL:
Hey!

20:46.779 --> 20:48.281
Fine, you're right.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.749
I cheated.

20:49.782 --> 20:50.750
I knew you were dirty.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.819
Not any worse than you,

20:52.852 --> 20:54.654
rigging this contest
just to get me

20:54.687 --> 20:56.389
to confess to rigging
the contest.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.757
Hey, no one's innocent.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.559
The real little pilgrim
of Natesville

20:59.592 --> 21:00.827
was a psychotic dwarf

21:00.860 --> 21:02.562
who slaughtered
an entire Indian village

21:02.595 --> 21:04.297
to get a basket of radishes.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.574
JIMMY:
Parents can sometimes go
a little too far

21:14.607 --> 21:16.343
where their kids are concerned.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.478
You never know how much help
to give them,

21:18.511 --> 21:21.681
and the truth is the kids
probably don't even care.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.749
(pops)

21:22.782 --> 21:23.850
It's the adults

21:23.883 --> 21:25.485
that get caught up
in the competition.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.086
I know you cheated.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.788
Prove it.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.957
(blows raspberries)

21:30.990 --> 21:32.992
That's our girl.
