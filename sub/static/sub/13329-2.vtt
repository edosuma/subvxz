WEBVTT

00:11.779 --> 00:14.815
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S A CUP.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.218
WHAT, A NEW CUP?

00:17.318 --> 00:19.353
YEAH, I GOT A NEW CUP.
DO YOU LIKE IT?

00:19.453 --> 00:21.855
- WE'VE GOT A CUP.
- YEAH, WE'VE GOT ONE CUP.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.191
WE NEEDED TWO CUPS.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.692
WHY WOULD WE NEED
TWO CUPS?

00:24.792 --> 00:26.727
SO I CAN HAVE A CUP OF TEA
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU.

00:26.827 --> 00:30.464
- BRET, DO YOU EVEN PAY ANY
ATTENTION TO THE CUP ROSTER?
- YOUR CUP ROSTER.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.367
THAT MEANS I CAN'T
DRINK A CUP OF TEA
BETWEEN 7:00 AND 9:00 PM.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.803
WELL, I HAVE IT
TILL 9:00 AND THEN
YOU GET IT FOR TWO HOURS.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.172
THEN I USE IT
FROM 11:00 TILL 1:00.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.840
YOU USE IT
FROM 1:00 TILL 3:00.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.175
YEAH, I HAVE TO WAIT
TILL 1:00 IF I WANT
TO HAVE ANOTHER CUP.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.443
AND THEN WE GIVE
THE CUP A REST.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.512
IT WAS ONLY $2.79.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.415
- $2.79?
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS QUITE GOOD.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.383
( sighs )

00:49.483 --> 00:51.852
OKAY, WELL, I JUST NEED
A SECOND TO CALM DOWN.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.821
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.690
I SUPPOSE.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.298
( theme music playing )

01:31.725 --> 01:33.694
( guitar strumming )

01:38.966 --> 01:40.734
BRET.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.336
- BRET.
- MM-HMM?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.338
OUR CHECK FOR THE
PHONE BILL BOUNCED.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.340
IT SAYS HERE
ON OUR BANK STATEMENT

01:46.440 --> 01:52.280
THAT OUR ACCOUNT
WAS SHORT $2.79.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.515
HOW MUCH
WAS THAT CUP AGAIN?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.883
$2.79.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.952
OH, THAT'S QUITE
INTERESTING, ISN'T IT?

01:59.052 --> 02:01.489
WELL, BECAUSE
OUR CHECK BOUNCED,

02:01.589 --> 02:03.257
WE GOT CHARGED
A $30 OVERDRAFT FEE

02:03.357 --> 02:06.093
WHICH MADE
OUR GAS BILL BOUNCE.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.861
YEAH,
THAT'S BORING, MAN.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.465
YES, BUT THE POINT IS
BECAUSE OF YOUR $2.79
SPENDING SPREE,

02:11.565 --> 02:14.802
WE NOW OWE $60
AND OUR PHONE AND GAS
ARE GONNA BE CUT OFF.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.205
STINK.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.709
AH.
WE GOT A LETTER FROM
THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.144
WHAT DID IT SAY?

02:24.245 --> 02:27.481
DIDN'T READ IT.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.023
ALL RIGHT.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.259
NICE DRESSING ROOM.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.396
BRET, WHERE'S YOUR GUITAR?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.831
HM?

02:43.931 --> 02:46.234
YOU SHOULD HAVE A GUITAR.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.202
I SOLD IT
TO PAY THE BILLS.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.003
YOU CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THAT.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.440
WON'T IT SOUND WEIRD
JUST WITH THE BIG GUITAR
THAT JEMAINE PLAYS?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.074
THE BASS.
IT'S CALLED A BASS.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.277
WELL, I CALL IT THE DAD GUITAR,
'CAUSE IT'S MORE LIKE A...

02:56.377 --> 02:58.246
( deep voice )
"I'M YOUR DAD.
HEY, MURRAY,

02:58.346 --> 03:01.582
GET INTO THE SHED
AND GET THE MOWER--
DO THE LAWN."

03:01.682 --> 03:04.452
YOU NEED BRET'S MUM GUITAR
TO ADD THE BEAUTIFUL TONES.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.153
( falsetto )
"COME ON, NOW.
MURRAY'S OKAY.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.622
HE'S WITH ME.
WHY YOU GET HOME
SO LATE, GORDON?"

03:08.722 --> 03:10.791
( deep voice )
"I WAS HAVING
A FEW BEERS."

03:10.891 --> 03:12.326
IT'LL SOUND FINE.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.162
IT WON'T SOUND FINE, BRET.
YOU'VE GOT NO GUITAR.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.498
HOW DOES IT SOUND THEN?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.267
- ( hums softly )
- I CAN HARDLY HEAR IT.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.236
( mimics guitar strum )

03:23.571 --> 03:25.439
YOU'D HAVE TO BE DEAF
TO HEAR THAT.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.842
- * THE HUMANS ARE DEAD...
- ( Bret mimicking strums )

03:28.942 --> 03:31.245
* THE HUMANS ARE DEAD

03:31.345 --> 03:35.716
* WE USED POISONOUS
GASES... *

03:37.385 --> 03:39.687
Murray:
OH, GOOD NEWS.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.456
THE NEW NEW ZEALAND
CONSULATE NEWSLETTER IS OUT.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.958
- OH, WHO CARES?
- YOU SHOULD CARE, JEMAINE.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.060
- WELL, I DON'T.
- SHALL I READ
THE MUSIC REVIEW SECTION?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.329
- IF YOU MUST.
- WHAT?

03:48.429 --> 03:51.499
"CONCHORDS CRASH AND BURN."

03:51.599 --> 03:53.601
DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD.
"BY MURRAY HEWITT."

03:53.701 --> 03:56.304
- YOU WROTE THIS?
- "THE FLIGHT OF
THE CONCHORDS..."

03:56.404 --> 03:57.705
- WHAT?
- "...HAVE
GREAT POTENTIAL,

03:57.805 --> 04:00.708
BUT LAST NIGHT,
PLAYING WITH ONLY
ONE GUITAR,

04:00.808 --> 04:03.511
THE DAD GUITAR
OR "BASS" IN MUSO TERMS,

04:03.611 --> 04:07.281
AND ONE AIR GUITAR
WHICH WAS MIMED,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.249
THEY WERE A MUSICAL
EMBARRASSMENT.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
- TWO STARS."
- TWO STARS?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.153
- TWO STARS.
- YOU CAN'T GIVE US
TWO STARS, MURRAY.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.788
TWO OUT OF FIVE STARS?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.123
WELL, I WISH IT WAS,

04:16.223 --> 04:17.858
BUT IT'S OUT OF 100.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.527
HMM.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.395
- OH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS OUT OF FIVE.
- DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.196
SAY IT'S OUT OF FIVE.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.066
CAN WE USE
THE EMERGENCY BAND FUND
TO GET MY GUITAR BACK?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.035
WELL, THAT'S--

04:28.135 --> 04:30.170
THAT'S ACTUALLY TIED UP
IN AN INVESTMENT AT THE MOMENT.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.272
WHAT'S THIS INVESTMENT?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.442
IT'S A FRIEND OF MINE
FROM NIGERIA.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.411
- NIGEL SOLADU.
- WHEN DID YOU GO
TO NIGERIA?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.413
WELL, I DIDN'T GO.
THAT'S THE BEST BIT.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.615
HE JUST RANDOMLY SEND ME
AN INTERNET LETTER

04:41.715 --> 04:44.552
OFFERING ME
A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
AND I WENT WITH IT.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.087
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME,
HE'LL RETURN THE MONEY
I INVESTED

04:47.187 --> 04:48.356
PLUS 1,000% INTEREST

04:48.456 --> 04:50.724
AND A SHARE
OF HIS FAMILY FORTUNES.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.626
- IT'S A SCAM.
- IT IS NOT A SCAM.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.862
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
WANT TO SCAM ME, JEMAINE,

04:54.962 --> 04:56.597
AND ON THE INTERNET SERVICE,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.500
ONE OF THE TRUSTED THINGS
OF TODAY'S SOCIETY?

05:01.469 --> 05:03.170
HAVE YOU GOT
ANY FOOD HERE?

05:03.270 --> 05:04.805
OH YOU WANT A COUPLE
OF BISCUITS, DO YOU?

05:04.905 --> 05:07.708
OKAY, WE CAN ORDER SOME.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.411
JUST FILL OUT THIS.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.380
PUT HOW MANY BISCUITS
YOU WANT, YOUR NAME,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.114
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
BRING IN SOME I.D.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.283
THAT GETS SENT BACK
TO WELLINGTON.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.852
WE'LL HAVE
YOUR BISCUITS BY TUESDAY.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.659
WHO'S GONNA WANT TO BUY
ONE OF THOSE, BRET?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.029
MAINLY PEOPLE WHO NEED
TO DRINK FROM FAR AWAY.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.264
SUPERSTRAWS!

05:31.365 --> 05:33.434
- WELL, HELLO, GUYS.
- Both: HEY, MEL.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.236
I WILL HAVE
A SUPERSTRAW, PLEASE.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.638
- AWESOME.
- HERE WE GO.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.441
- THANK YOU.
- HEY, GREAT GIG
THE OTHER NIGHT.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.277
I NOTICED, BRET,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GUITAR.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.279
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT YOU FORGOT?

05:46.380 --> 05:48.048
OR ARE YOU
TRYING IT OUT

05:48.148 --> 05:51.351
OR IS THAT JUST SOMETHING
I'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.521
I SOLD IT
TO GET SOME MONEY.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.524
WOW, THAT'S SO ROMANTIC--

05:56.624 --> 06:00.360
TWO STRUGGLING MUSICIANS
LIVING IN POVERTY

06:00.461 --> 06:03.797
AND DESPAIR,
SELLING THEIR INSTRUMENTS.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.867
I KNOW IT SOUNDS GOOD,
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY DEPRESSING.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.937
ALL OUR UTILITIES
WERE CUT OFF BECAUSE
BRET BOUGHT A CUP.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.574
OH, WELL, I COULD
GIVE YOU GUYS SOME MONEY.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.543
- YEAH?
- THANKS, MEL.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.911
I MEAN, YOU WOULD HAVE
TO EARN IT, OF COURSE.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.048
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T INSULT YOU
BY GIVING YOU CHARITY.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.450
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?

06:22.550 --> 06:25.185
DO YOU GUYS...

06:25.285 --> 06:27.755
DO MASSAGE?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.323
- BRET DOES.
- NO.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.625
- I DON'T. YOU DO.
- BRET DOES.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.461
- I DON'T, BUT BRET DOES.
- HE DOES.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.128
- JEMAINE'S THE ONE FOR THAT.
- BRET ALWAYS DOES THAT.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.097
- I'VE SEEN YOU DO IT.
- BRET'S ALWAYS MASSAGING.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.232
BRET'S A REAL
GOOD MASSEUSE.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.735
OKAY THEN.
WELL, BRET,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.371
I WILL SEE YOU
AT MY PLACE AT 4:30?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.607
HUH?
( mimics trumpet )

06:53.947 --> 06:55.583
SHOULD I LAY DOWN?

06:55.683 --> 06:57.685
NO NO,
THIS IS GOOD.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.988
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE OFF
SOME CLOTHES, SO YOU COULD--

07:01.088 --> 07:02.656
NO NO, THAT'S GOOD.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.659
WHOO!
HEY, BRET, WHEN DOES
THE MASSAGE START?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.628
WHEN DO YOU TOUCH ME?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.630
I'M JUST DOING IT
VERY GENTLY

07:09.730 --> 07:11.665
- TO BEGIN WITH.
- ARE YOU--

07:11.765 --> 07:14.434
I CAN'T REALLY FEEL IT.
I WANNA FEEL IT.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.969
I'M TRYING TO--

07:16.069 --> 07:18.639
- JUST STAY IN YOUR SEAT.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.874
( softly )
ARE YOU SURE DOUG'S
GONNA BE OKAY WITH THIS?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.777
YEAH, IT'S JUST A MASSAGE.
DOUG WILL BE FINE WITH IT.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.914
YEAH,
I'M FINE WITH IT.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.551
UNLESS I START
FEELING SOMETHING,

07:30.651 --> 07:33.887
I GUESS I'M NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO PAY YOU $30.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.456
I'LL DO IT.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.425
( moaning )

07:38.526 --> 07:40.293
OH YEAH.
WOW.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.429
OH, YOU ARE GOOD AT THIS.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.064
( moans louder )

07:44.164 --> 07:47.434
YOU'RE LIKE A SAMURAI,
LIKE A MASSAGE SAMURAI.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.869
I'M JUST PATTING HER.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.872
OH, I FEEL LIKE
I'VE HIRED A GIGOLO.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.708
( giggles )
I'M JUST KIDDING.
I WOULD NEVER HIRE--

07:54.808 --> 07:57.745
I MEAN, I WOULD, I WOULD,
BUT I WOULDN'T PAY YOU.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.347
( whispers )
I WOULD. I WOULD
PAY YOU SO MUCH MONEY.

08:00.447 --> 08:03.016
I'M JUST KIDDING.
THAT'S NOT HOW I AM.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.952
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M ABOUT.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.120
I'M JOKING.
( whispers ) I'M NOT.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.889
I AM.
I'M NOT.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.924
OH WOW.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.195
BRET, YOU KNOW HOW YOU
TOLD ME YOU WERE GOOD AT SEX?

08:15.295 --> 08:18.198
- ARE YOU?
- THAT WAS JUST 'CAUSE YOU
ASKED ME IN FRONT OF SALLY.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.267
RIGHT, YEAH.
OKAY.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.202
WELL, YOU WERE
LYING THEN.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.538
- I WAS EXAGGERATING
A LITTLE BIT.
- LYING.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.675
- NO, EXAGGERATING.
- WELL, MAYBE MEL'S RIGHT.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.376
MAYBE WE COULD BE
PROSTITUTES.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.580
PROSTITUTION
IS A QUICK WAY
OF MAKING MONEY.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.083
IT IS NOT DEGRADING.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.851
IT IS NOT
DEGRADING.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.920
- HAVE YOU SEEN
"PRETTY WOMAN"?
- NO.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.124
WELL, IT'S A STORY
ABOUT A PROSTITUTE
CALLED RICHARD GERE

08:44.224 --> 08:47.360
WHO GETS TO GO OUT
WITH A "PRETTY WOMAN"
JULIA ROBERTS

08:47.460 --> 08:49.029
WHO PAYS HIM
A LOT OF MONEY.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.198
DO YOU THINK JULIA ROBERTS
IS A PRETTY WOMAN?

08:51.298 --> 08:52.866
YES.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.968
WELL, IMAGINE GETTING
TO HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN

08:55.068 --> 08:58.071
SIMILAR TO JULIA ROBERTS
AND GETTING PAID FOR IT.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.275
JEMAINE, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA GET SEX
AND GET PAID.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.613
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE WE NEVER
GET SEX OR GET PAID.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.281
BRET, THE LADIES GO CRAZY
FOR MY SUGARLUMPS.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.251
- YOUR WHAT?
- CHECK IT OUT.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.420
ALL THE LADIES ARE JUST
CHECKING OUT MY SUGARLUMPS.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.724
( pop music playing )

09:20.894 --> 09:22.462
* LET ME TELL YOU

09:22.562 --> 09:24.865
* I SEE YOU GIRLS
CHECKING OUT MY TRUNKS *

09:24.965 --> 09:27.034
* I SEE YOU GIRLS
CHECKING OUT THE FRONT
OF MY TRUNKS *

09:27.134 --> 09:29.837
* I SEE YOU GIRLS
LOOKING AT MY JUNK
THEN CHECKING OUT MY RUMP *

09:29.937 --> 09:31.438
* THEN BACK
TO MY SUGARLUMPS *

09:31.538 --> 09:33.240
* WHEN I SHAKE IT,
I SHAKE IT ALL UP *

09:33.340 --> 09:35.508
* YOU PROBABLY THINK
THAT MY PANTS HAVE THE MUMPS *

09:35.609 --> 09:37.377
* IT'S JUST MY SUGARLUMPS,
BUMP-BA-BUMPS *

09:37.477 --> 09:39.412
* THEY LOOK SO GOOD,
THAT'S WHY I KEEP 'EM
IN THE FRONT *

09:39.512 --> 09:43.283
* ALL THE LADIES
CHECKING OUT *

09:43.383 --> 09:45.653
* MY SUGARLUMPS

09:45.753 --> 09:48.288
- * SWEET SUGARLUMPS
- * THEY DRIVE THE
LADIES CRAZY *

09:48.388 --> 09:50.557
* ALL THESE BITCHES
CHECKING OUT MY BRITCHES *

09:50.658 --> 09:52.760
* PUT 'EM IN A TRANCE
WHEN I WEAR TRACK PANTS *

09:52.860 --> 09:54.728
* MY DUNGAREES
MAKE THEM HUNGER-EES *

09:54.828 --> 09:56.697
* THEY'RE OVER THE MOON
WHEN I DON PANTALOONS *

09:56.797 --> 09:59.032
* MY SUGARLUMPS
ARE TWO OF A KIND *

09:59.132 --> 10:01.534
* SWEET AND WHITE
AND HIGHLY REFINED *

10:01.635 --> 10:03.470
* HONEYS TRY ALL KINDS
OF TOMFOOLERY *

10:03.570 --> 10:05.839
* TO STEAL A FEEL
OF MY FAMILY JEWELRY *

10:05.939 --> 10:07.708
* MY CANNONBALLS
CAUSE A KERFUFFLE *

10:07.808 --> 10:10.177
* THE LADIES, THEY HUSTLE
TO RUFFLE MY TRUFFLE *

10:10.277 --> 10:11.945
* IF YOU PARTY
WITH THE PARTY PRINCE *

10:12.045 --> 10:14.748
* YOU GET TWO COMPLIMENTARY
AFTER-DINNER MINTS *

10:14.848 --> 10:16.750
* WE SEE YOU GIRLS
CHECKING OUT OUR TRUNKS *

10:16.850 --> 10:18.786
* WE SEE YOU GIRLS
CHECKING OUT THE FRONT
OF OUR TRUNKS *

10:18.886 --> 10:21.554
* WE SEE YOU GIRLS
LOOKING AT OUR JUNK
THEN CHECKING OUT OUR RUMPS *

10:21.655 --> 10:23.957
* THEN BACK
TO OUR SUGARLUMPS *

10:31.699 --> 10:33.633
* CHILLIN' AT MY STORE,
DOING MY THING *

10:33.734 --> 10:35.736
* WHEN IN WALKS A GUY
WITH HIS DICK IN A SLING *

10:35.836 --> 10:37.938
* I'M LIKE, "HOLY SHIT,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?" *

10:38.038 --> 10:39.707
* HE SAID, "HOW MUCH
WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR
THE FAMILY JEWELS?" *

10:39.807 --> 10:41.909
* I SAID, "10 BUCKS,"
HE SAID, "NO WAY" *

10:42.009 --> 10:44.411
* "10 BUCKS AND A FRISBEE,"
HE SAID, "OKAY" *

10:44.511 --> 10:46.579
* AND I TOOK HIS SUGARLUMPS
AND PUT 'EM UP IN A DISPLAY *

10:46.680 --> 10:48.581
* AND SOLD 'EM AS HACKY SACKS

10:48.682 --> 10:51.484
* ALL THE LADIES,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.699
* SWEET SUGARLUMPS.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.735
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRET?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.669
I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO BE A PROSTITUTE.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.638
- WHAT?
- YOU SHOULD BE
THE PROSTITUTE.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.306
YOU BOUGHT THE CUP.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.210
HI, DO YOU NEED
A PROSTITUTE?

11:17.310 --> 11:18.846
EXCUSE ME.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.514
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT DO YOU SEE MY FRIEND
OVER THERE

11:21.614 --> 11:24.551
WITH THE RED SHIRT?

11:24.651 --> 11:26.253
HE'S A BIT OF
A PART-TIME PROSTITUTE.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.121
I WAS WONDERING--

11:28.221 --> 11:29.356
- NO THANKS.
- MIGHT THIS ENTICE YOU?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.991
NUT LOAF.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.462
- SHE SAID NO.
- DID SHE SAY WHY?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.866
BRET, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
WEAR SHORTS AND SHOW
YOUR LEGS OFF

11:38.966 --> 11:41.634
AND MAYBE WEAR A COWBOY HAT
AND COVER UP YOUR HEAD A BIT.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.370
I DON'T HAVE
A COWBOY HAT.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.172
I'VE GOT THAT OLD
SUN HAT, THOUGH.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.841
AND ALSO,
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO THE WHOLE WAY.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.042
YOU CAN'T JUST HUG THEM.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.245
JUST HUGS UNTIL
I GET MORE CONFIDENT.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.182
OKAY.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.250
DO YOU WANT TO SWAP
FOR A WHILE?

12:01.588 --> 12:03.023
EXCUSE ME.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.358
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PARTY
WITH MY FRIEND?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.860
I'M SORRY?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.728
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
MAMBA?

12:08.829 --> 12:11.498
- WHAT?
- YOU SEE MY FRIEND
OVER THERE?

12:11.598 --> 12:13.466
HE'S A PLAYER,
A NIGHT OWL.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.768
20-40-60.

12:14.868 --> 12:18.005
OKAY, 10-30-50.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.807
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
- $5.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.374
HE'LL GO ALL THE WAY
AND HE'S CLEAN.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.876
- YOU INTERESTED?
- WHAT?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.645
- ( stammers )
- NOT INTERESTED?
OKAY, MOVE ALONG.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.414
MOVE ALONG.
I'M WALKING HERE.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.316
I'M WALKING.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.353
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- NOT INTERESTED.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.661
Jemaine:
IT'S DARK, BRET.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.063
Bret:
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.265
WHAT EXPRESSION'S
ON YOUR FACE?

12:45.365 --> 12:48.035
UM,
GUILTY EXPRESSION.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.003
WHAT EXPRESSION'S
ON YOUR FACE?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.205
SAD BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY,

12:52.305 --> 12:55.275
BUT SATISFIED
'CAUSE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE CUP.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.511
THAT'S A WEIRD
EXPRESSION.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.615
BRET, HOW MUCH
ARE YOU SELLING
THOSE SUPERSTRAWS FOR?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.284
ONE DOLLAR.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.619
HOW MANY STRAWS DOES IT TAKE
TO MAKE A SUPERSTRAW?

13:06.719 --> 13:07.888
FIVE.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.289
WHAT'S THE TOTAL COST
OF THOSE FIVE STRAWS?

13:09.389 --> 13:12.359
TWO-FIFT--
OH.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.563
I'VE SOLD
QUITE A FEW OF THEM.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.799
OH.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.236
( Bret and Jemaine
mimicking guitars )
* HUMANS ARE DEAD

13:24.137 --> 13:26.506
* HUMANS ARE DEAD

13:26.606 --> 13:30.477
* HAD TO BE DONE

13:30.577 --> 13:33.981
* SO WE COULD HAVE FUN.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.987
OKAY, LISTEN
TO THIS REVIEW, GUYS.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.922
"FLIGHT OF THE NO-CHORDS.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.457
IT WAS HARD TO TELL
IF THE BAND WAS A BAND

13:44.557 --> 13:47.294
OR A MIME TROOP.
NO STARS."

13:49.329 --> 13:51.064
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING ABOUT YOU.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.033
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING ABOUT US.
YOU WROTE IT.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.002
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO WROTE IT, JEMAINE.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.004
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
ARE READING.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.006
THIS IS THE WRITTEN
REPORT ON YOU

13:59.106 --> 14:01.708
- THAT SOMEONE'S WRITTEN.
- YEAH. YOU.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.877
MAYBE.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.113
- IT SAYS "BY MURRAY HEWITT."
- YEAH, I KNOW.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.982
- IT'S GOT YOUR
PICTURE THERE.
- YES.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.920
YOU'RE A BAND
WITH NO INSTRUMENTS.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.388
- HOW DOES IT FEEL?
- NOT VERY GOOD.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.158
NO, NOT VERY GOOD.
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY
SUCCESSFUL MUSICIANS

14:18.258 --> 14:20.660
- WITH NO INSTRUMENTS?
- THE MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.862
- I CAN'T.
- BOYZ II MEN.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.864
BOBBY MCFERRIN.
PAVAROTTI.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.466
BRET'S RIGHT.
THERE ARE NONE.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.667
NO ONE ELSE
IS DOING IT.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.202
THE VENUE DOESN'T
WANT YOU BACK

14:29.302 --> 14:30.870
UNTIL YOU'VE GOT
INSTRUMENTS.

14:30.971 --> 14:31.972
- IS THAT WHAT THEY SAID?
- YUP.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.941
SO GUESS WHAT I'VE DONE?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.276
I'VE WRITTEN UP A TIMELINE,
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.011
TO SHOW US HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA TAKE

14:38.111 --> 14:40.047
TO RAISE THE MONEY

14:40.147 --> 14:41.915
TO GET YOUR GUITARS BACK.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.683
IT'S A PRETTY
BIG TIMELINE.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.519
YEAH, I SORT OF
MADE THE SCALE WRONG
AT THE START THERE

14:46.619 --> 14:47.787
AND IT GOT OUT OF HAND.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.257
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE FIRST ONE I MADE, THOUGH.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.259
IT'S DEFINITELY
AN IMPROVEMENT.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.028
BASICALLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR GUITARS BACK

14:55.128 --> 14:56.930
IN ABOUT 14 YEARS.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.431
- 14 YEARS?
- YUP.

14:58.531 --> 15:02.202
AND THAT'S IF YOU STOP
SELLING THOSE STRAWS, BRET.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.005
WHAT ABOUT
THE BAND INVESTMENT
WITH MR. NIGEL SOLADU?

15:05.105 --> 15:08.075
YES, WELL, I'M STILL
WAITING ON THAT.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.510
I'VE GOT YOU
SOME GOOD NEWS HERE.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.779
- I'VE GOT YOU A PAID GIG.
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.148
YES, WELL ACTUALLY
IT'S JUST BRET.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.817
AND IT'S NOT
A MUSICAL GIG AS SUCH.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.852
YOU'LL BE DRESSING UP
IN A COSTUME

15:19.953 --> 15:21.288
FOR A GUY CALLED EDDIE.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.123
- EDDIE?
- YES, YOU KNOW EDDIE?

15:23.223 --> 15:26.059
- MY BOSS?
- YUP, HE PHONED ME UP.
IT'S ALL SORTED.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.061
HE SAID TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR PHONE
WASN'T WORKING

15:28.161 --> 15:30.063
AND THAT YOU'VE GOT A JOB
IF YOU WANT IT.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.598
SO HE JUST LEFT
A MESSAGE.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.967
- WELL, IT WAS A GIG OFFER,
WASN'T IT?
- NO.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.502
THAT'S ALREADY
MY JOB.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.470
SO...

15:37.570 --> 15:39.439
I CAN'T GET A CUT
ON THAT?

15:39.539 --> 15:42.175
NO, 'CAUSE THAT'S
ALREADY MY JOB.
I DO THAT JOB.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.877
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL NOTE THAT DOWN.

15:44.978 --> 15:49.016
"NO COMMISSION
ON BRET'S JOB."

15:49.116 --> 15:50.517
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, JEMAINE?
- WHAT?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.885
DO YOU HAVE AN OUTSIDE-
SOURCE INCOME?

15:52.986 --> 15:54.387
YEAH, SORT OF.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.524
I COULD WORK ON THAT WITH YOU
AND GET A CUT OF IT.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.126
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.029
- I'D LIKE TO.
- NO.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.499
I NEED SOME MONEY.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.139
HEY, CAROL,
IT'S JEMAINE HERE.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.441
I WAS JUST
CALLING TO SAY--

16:14.541 --> 16:16.376
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW
WE SLEPT TOGETHER

16:16.476 --> 16:18.145
ABOUT SIX TIMES
I THINK IT WAS

16:18.245 --> 16:19.812
LAST YEAR
IN FEBRUARY?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.881
UH, YEAH.
I'M A PROSTITUTE NOW.

16:21.981 --> 16:26.819
UM, SO I WAS WONDERING
IF I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET
SOME MONEY FOR THAT,

16:26.919 --> 16:31.358
MAYBE ABOUT $40 A TIME?

16:31.458 --> 16:32.825
THAT'S $3 OFF.

16:32.925 --> 16:37.097
ALSO, WOULD YOU
BE INTERESTED IN
GOING OUT SOMETIME?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.799
I'D LOVE THAT.
OKAY, BYE.

16:39.899 --> 16:44.471
- Bret: ANY LUCK?
- POSSIBLY, YEAH.
VERY PROMISING.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.241
YOU SHOULD
BE PROSTITUTING
YOURSELF, BRET.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.510
NO, I FOUND BEING
A PROSTITUTE DEGRADING.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.247
FREE CONDOMS.
FREE CONDOMS FROM
THE HUMAN CONDOM!

17:01.788 --> 17:06.693
JEMAINE, ARE YOU
PROSTITUTING YOURSELF
IN FRONT OF MY BUILDING?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.997
NO.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.832
- DID BRET TELL YOU?
- NO.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.535
I SAW IT ON THE ADVERTISEMENT
ON THE LOBBY NOTICE BOARD.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.938
DID YOU TAKE THAT OFF
THE LOBBY NOTICE BOARD?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.374
YES AND I DON'T HAVE
MY OWN COPY.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.876
I JUST DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO PAY OUR RENT OTHERWISE.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.512
- WE'RE BANKRUPT.
- OH.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.315
TRY HOTELS--
FANCY ONES AND ONES
NEAR THE AIRPORT.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.118
- OH, OKAY.
- YEAH.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.452
THANKS
FOR THE SUGGESTION.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.254
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
- I READ IT IN A BOOK.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.256
- WHAT BOOK?
- JUST A NORMAL BOOK.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.258
JUST A NORMAL BOOK--
NONDESCRIPT.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.026
- JUST A BOOK I HAD.
- JUST A BOOK.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.962
- JUST A NORMAL BOOK.
- JUST A VERY NORMAL BOOK.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.499
- JUST A SUPER--
- A BOOK THAT TELLS YOU
WHERE TO SELL YOUR BODY.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.302
JUST A NORMAL BOOK
WITH ALL KINDS OF FACTS.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.104
- THAT'S ONE OF 'EM.
- WHAT WAS THE TITLE?

17:51.204 --> 17:53.240
"JUST HOW
TO GET IT DONE."

17:54.407 --> 17:56.576
THIS LIFT IS SO SLOW.
( pushing buttons )

18:01.114 --> 18:02.715
OKAY, BAND MEETING.
BRET?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.016
PRESENT.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.519
JEMAINE.
NOT PRESENT.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.888
ABSENT.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.657
BRET.
NO, I'VE DONE YOU.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.892
THIS HAS PUT ME
ALL OUT OF WHACK.
WHERE'S JEMAINE?

18:12.992 --> 18:15.195
HE'S OUT
WORKING THE BEAT.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.830
- WORKING THE BEAT?
- YEAH.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.333
- DRUMMING?
- NO, HE'S A GIGOLO.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.202
- A WHAT?
- HE'S A PROSTITUTE.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.371
JEMAINE'S A HOOKER.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.006
- A WHORE? IS HE?
- ( inhales sharply )

18:27.106 --> 18:30.076
- A PROSTITUTE.
- A MALE PROSTITUTE.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.345
( man clicking tongue )

18:32.445 --> 18:34.013
JEMAINE SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.548
INDEED
HE SHOULD NOT, SIR.

18:35.648 --> 18:39.118
( softly )
UH, MURRAY, WHO'S--
WHO'S THIS?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.120
OH, THIS IS
NIGEL SOLADU.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.289
HE'S MY NEW
BUSINESS PARTNER.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
- FROM THE INTERNET?
- YES!

18:44.391 --> 18:46.526
CAN YOU IMAGINE IT?
OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
THAT USE THE INTERNET,

18:46.626 --> 18:49.095
ONLY I WAS WILLING
TO HELP HIM.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.863
- THIS IS BRET.
- HI.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.700
BRET, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET OUT THERE
AND STOP JEMAINE.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.069
ALL RIGHT? HE SHOULDN'T
BE SELLING HIMSELF
TO THE STREET!

18:57.170 --> 18:59.206
JEMAINE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S DEGRADING.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.308
- IT IS DEGRADING.
- IT IS DEGRADING.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.443
HE'S JUST PUTTING ON
A BRAVE FACE.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.978
- NO ONE LIKES
BEING A PROSTITUTE.
- JEMAINE LIKES IT.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.514
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BECOME A PROSTITUTE?

19:07.614 --> 19:08.948
WHY AREN'T I
A PROSTITUTE?

19:09.048 --> 19:10.417
WHY AREN'T I
A PROSTITUTE, BRET?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.652
GOOD ONE, NIGEL.
WHY ISN'T NIGEL
A PROSTITUTE?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.721
WE COULD ALL BE
IN A PROSTITUTE CLUB.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.324
IT'S 'CAUSE OF THAT CUP.
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
BOUGHT THAT CUP.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.659
I JUST WANTED A NEW CUP.
WE ONLY HAD ONE CUP.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.328
SO THERE'S TWO OF US

19:21.428 --> 19:24.063
I OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT
FOR JEMAINE TO FINISH HIS--

19:24.163 --> 19:26.199
ANYWAY, GOOD NEWS
ON THE MONEY FRONT, RIGHT?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.501
MY FAMILY THANKS YOU
FOR THE LOAN.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.770
THANKS TO MURRAY'S TRUST
AND GENEROSITY,

19:30.870 --> 19:34.607
YOUR BAND INVESTMENT FUND
HAS SEEN A VERY HEALTHY PROFIT.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.610
WE CAN GET YOUR GUITARS BACK
AND WE CAN PAY YOUR POWER BILL.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.413
SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY TO MR. SOLADU?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.615
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
NIGEL.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.552
OH AND ON BEHALF OF JEMAINE--
HE'S PROSTITUTING HIMSELF
AT THE MOMENT--

19:45.652 --> 19:47.420
- ALL RIGHT,
DON'T GO ON ABOUT IT.
- --THANK YOU FOR THAT.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.089
GOOD.
ALSO, I'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.126
NAGOOTA TATA LACIE.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.762
DID I SAY THAT RIGHT?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.797
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.532
I'M STILL TRYING
ON THAT ONE.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.701
WOULD YOU BE OKAY
IF I WERE TO USE
YOUR COMPUTER?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.203
- I WOULD LIKE
TO CHECK MY EMAIL.
- YES, CERTAINLY.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.773
THERE'S THE KEYBOARD HERE.
THERE'S THE MOUSE.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.842
YOU CAN JUST GO UP
AND DOWN ON THE KEYS.
I DON'T USE THAT.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.245
THERE'S THE TV SCREEN.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.146
( whispering )
OKAY, BE QUIET.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.082
HE'S GOING ONLINE, RIGHT?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.318
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT THERE
AND SAVE JEMAINE.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.553
IT'S GETTING DARK.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

20:20.653 --> 20:23.423
WHEN YOU'RE
OUT ON THE STREETS
AS A MAN PROSTITUTE.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.124
- I'LL GO TELL HIM.
- GO, BRET.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.526
OKAY, SEE YA.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.062
EUGENE, HAVE YOU
SEEN JEMAINE?

20:30.162 --> 20:32.098
UH, I--

20:41.708 --> 20:44.444

BENEATH THE STREET LIGHT *

20:44.544 --> 20:47.013
* THERE'S A MAN
WHOSE PANTS ARE TOO TIGHT *

21:05.332 --> 21:07.800
* THE STREETS ARE CRUEL,
HE JUST ACTS COOL *

21:07.900 --> 21:11.037
* HE GOES TO WORK
WITH ONLY HIS ONE TOOL *

21:12.805 --> 21:17.444
* YOU CAN PUT AWAY
YOUR TOOL, JEMAINE *

21:17.544 --> 21:20.380
* YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A PROSTITUTE *

21:20.480 --> 21:22.782
* NO NO NO NO NO

A RED BOY BRO-HO *

21:40.433 --> 21:43.603
* HE CANNOT SEE
HIS WAY OUT *

21:43.703 --> 21:46.673
* I CANNOT SEE
MY WAY OUT *

21:46.773 --> 21:49.676
* HE CAN'T SEE
HIS WAY OUT *

21:49.776 --> 21:52.712
* MALE PROSTITUTION SEEMS
TO BE MY ONLY OPTION *

21:52.812 --> 21:55.482
* HE CAN'T SEE
HIS WAY OUT *

21:55.582 --> 21:58.351
* I CANNOT SEE
MY WAY OUT *

21:58.451 --> 22:01.488
* HE CAN'T SEE
HIS WAY OUT *

22:01.588 --> 22:04.090
* NO NO NO NO NO

22:04.190 --> 22:06.959
* HE'S SELLING CHEAP THRILLS
TO PAY EXPENSIVE BILLS *

22:07.059 --> 22:09.796
* BUT CHECK YOUR RESUME,
YOU MUST HAVE SOME
OTHER SKILLS *

22:11.931 --> 22:15.502
* DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER SKILLS...
LIKE TYPING? *

22:15.602 --> 22:18.771
* THEY SEE HIM
WANTING TO PLEASE THEM *

22:18.871 --> 22:21.808
* WANTING TO PLAY THEM,
BUT THEY DON'T EVEN PAY HIM *

22:22.975 --> 22:24.544
* OH NO NO

22:24.644 --> 22:26.913
* THEY DON'T THINK
HE'S WORTH IT AT ALL *

22:27.013 --> 22:30.417
* THOUGH THEY ARE NO ONE,
HE TRIES TO BRING THEM HOME *

22:30.517 --> 22:33.920
* MAYBE IT'D BE OKAY
IF HE LIVED ALONE *

22:35.622 --> 22:37.557
* OOH, YOU HAVE
A ROOMMATE, JEMAINE *

22:37.657 --> 22:39.225

LOOK, SO...
I HAVE $200.
IS THAT ENOUGH?

23:20.099 --> 23:22.435
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.537
YEAH, I SHOULD BE
ABLE TO GET

23:24.637 --> 23:27.474
( mumbles )
50% EXTRA.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.509
- OH, GREAT.
- YEAH.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.879
I HAVE A FEW RULES.
ONE: NO LAUGHING,

23:32.979 --> 23:35.081
ESPECIALLY DURING, OKAY?
IT PUTS ME OFF.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.517
THAT'S ONE.
UM, NUMBER TWO:

23:37.617 --> 23:39.686
IF YOU GO OVERTIME,

23:39.786 --> 23:41.854
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHARGE YOU
FOR THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.

23:41.954 --> 23:45.024
- ONE OR TWO MINUTES IS--
- DO YOU WANT TO DO
THIS OR NOT?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.993
UH, YES I DO.

23:47.093 --> 23:51.097
IT'S MY POLICY FOR CLIENTS
TO HAVE A SHOWER.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.200
OKAY.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.974
( knocks on door )

24:05.512 --> 24:07.313
- BRET.
- JEMAINE.

24:07.413 --> 24:08.848
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE A PROSTITUTE.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.751
IT'S FINE, MAN.
MR. SOLADU'S MONEY
CAME THROUGH.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.453
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.455
MURRAY SAID
IT'S DEGRADING AS WELL.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.824
OH, IT ISN'T DEGRADING.
IT'S FINE.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.325
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.793
I JUST FEEL BAD
'CAUSE I GOT THE CUP.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.562
- NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- REALLY?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.430
- YES YES,
GET OUT OF HERE.
- IT IS MORE SOCIAL.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.500
- YEAH, EXACTLY.
- YOU CAN SIT DOWN,
HAVE A CUP OF TEA TOGETHER.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.736
GET OUT, BRET.
I'VE GOT A CUSTOMER.
IT'S A PRETTY WOMAN.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.238

- Man: POLICE DEPARTMENT.
OPEN UP.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.807

24:34.907 --> 24:36.576
I CALLED THEM
TO COME AND SAVE YOU.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.347
NEW YORK CITY POLICE.

24:41.447 --> 24:42.549
WE GOT A CALL
OF SOLICITATION

24:42.649 --> 24:43.850
OF PROSTITUTION
AT THIS LOCATION.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.253
YOU, ARE YOU
THE PROSTITUTE?

24:47.353 --> 24:49.355
YES, MA'AM.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.790
YOU'RE A PROSTITUTE
AS WELL?

24:50.890 --> 24:53.560
NO NO, I'M JUST THE GUY
THAT WEARS THE BIG CONDOM.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.531
A BIT BORING
IN JAIL, EH?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.201
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.574
I KNEW IF YOU BOUGHT A CUP,
WE'D END UP IN JAIL.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.776
- I KNEW IT.
- ( buzzer sounds )

25:12.211 --> 25:14.113
ARE THESE YOUR GUYS?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.715
YES, THIS IS THEM.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.551
- HELLO, GUYS.
- Both: HEY, MURRAY.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.887
WOW.
THIS IS A TURNOUT
FOR THE BOOKS, HUH?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.022
THIS IS THE LOWEST
OF THE LOW.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.757
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO NEW ZEALAND.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.661
JEMAINE,
WAS IT A GOOD THING
TO PROSTITUTE YOURSELF?

25:30.329 --> 25:32.565
- WELL--
- NO, IT WASN'T.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.835
AND, BRET, YOU'RE LUCKY
I'M BAILING YOU OUT.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.205
AND UNFORTUNATELY
I'VE HAD TO USE ALL THE PROFITS
FROM THE NIGEL SOLADU FUND,

25:39.305 --> 25:40.973
SO WE'RE BACK
AT SQUARE ONE.

25:41.073 --> 25:43.610
- TYPICAL, ISN'T IT?
- AT SQUARE ONE AGAIN?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.845
YES.
WE WERE AT SQUARE TWO,
BUT NOW WE'RE BACK.

25:45.945 --> 25:49.415
- WHEN WAS THAT?
- LET'S STOP TALKING
ABOUT SQUARES.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.584
LET'S GO.
YOU'RE LIKE
A COUPLE OF...

25:52.551 --> 25:54.086
JAILHOUSE TURKEYS.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.022
( theme music playing )

25:56.122 --> 25:58.024
WHEN'S THE ELECTRICITY
COMING BACK ON?

25:58.124 --> 25:59.425
THEY SAID IT
WOULD BE ON BY NOW.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.260
WHAT TIME IS IT?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.340
YOU'LL BE PLEASED
ABOUT THAT.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.787
( pop music playing )

26:42.568 --> 26:45.071
* GIRLS SURROUND ME
WHEN I'M STANDING
ON THE STOOP *

26:45.171 --> 26:46.906
* GIVING ME GIFTS
LIKE FREE CHICKEN SOUP *

26:47.006 --> 26:49.075
