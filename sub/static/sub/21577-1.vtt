00:01.160 --> 00:03.680
[drum and bass plays]

00:03.719 --> 00:05.960
All the crew locked in,
locked on your sound system.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
You're listening to the...
Your sound system to listen...

00:08.640 --> 00:11.880
You're listening to the sounds
of the legendary DJ Stevie!

00:13.080 --> 00:16.480
Phone number to call... What
is the phone number? Stevie.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.960
-Er, where is it?
-Phone number to call!

00:19.000 --> 00:21.440
-They should know it by now.
-Exactly.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.160
The phone number to call is
the same one that we usually do.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.200
[director] Has Grindah changed
much since we were last
with you?

00:28.240 --> 00:32.119
Yeah, he's doing coke and that
every night, even on
week nights.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.320
I used to know a guy that
done that, but he worked
in Carphone Warehouse.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.280
I understand that. But when you
are the best MC in the galaxy,

00:40.320 --> 00:42.760
why are you sticking
that shit up your nose?

00:42.800 --> 00:46.040
-[DJ Beats] See you later, boys.
-Where are you going?

00:46.080 --> 00:50.480
-I've got to go home.
-I'm gonna have a bit more
of this. Stevie, on the head.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.960
-[director] <i> Have you</i>
<i>seen much of Grindah?</i>
-[Miche] <i> No, not really.</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:57.280
His hair's been suffering quite
a lot and that's hurtful for me,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.920
and I feel like he's almost
doing that to get back at me.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.960
But what can I do? You just have
to let him ruin his own life.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And hair.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.520
-[director] I notice you've got
a bit of a new look going on.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.160
Everyone's like, "Oh, you should
get a job and go get a haircut."

01:17.200 --> 01:20.640
-Hello, I am a robot. No.
-Yeah. "Wear these clothes."

01:20.680 --> 01:23.680
Look at me. I look perfectly
fine, do you know what I mean?

01:23.720 --> 01:27.440
-After three months, your
clothes clean themselves.
-Do you know what I'm saying?

01:27.480 --> 01:29.800
Where's Decoy?
Is Decoy still here?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.600
Everyone went, I think.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.720
-That's daylight, bruv.
-Hurrah. Fucking hell!

01:34.760 --> 01:37.160
Let's start the breakfast show.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.400
[baby cries]

01:42.440 --> 01:44.960
Please stop crying, mate.
Please stop crying.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.080
Please stop crying. I can
actually hear it in my dreams.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
This scream, like,
even when she's not crying.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
If we've learned
anything from Robyn,

01:53.000 --> 01:54.840
it's that you really need
to express yourself.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.840
[Beats] Yeah. And also, like,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.160
really, really think about
if you're gonna have kids,

01:59.200 --> 02:01.960
like, proper think about it.
Don't just do it, cos...

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
I should've thought
about it a bit more.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.000
-What?
-Not in that way. I'm proper...

02:08.039 --> 02:11.039
over the moon and that, happy,
but just think about it.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.880
[baby cries]

02:12.920 --> 02:14.960
Yeah, obviously the mood
is quite stressful

02:15.000 --> 02:16.640
with a new baby and that.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.440
But she's too young to help.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.040
[Roche] Kevin. Kevin!

02:21.080 --> 02:23.560
-Yeah?
-Where's the washing powder?

02:23.600 --> 02:26.680
-Oh, I'll get it.
-Come on, sweetheart.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.520
-[baby screams]
-Oh, I know.

02:29.560 --> 02:34.640
You get heavier every day,
don't you? Heavier and louder.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.800
[knocking]

02:38.840 --> 02:40.320
-[Grindah] Oi!
-One minute.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.600
Oi! Oi!

02:42.640 --> 02:45.040
Hurry up. It's an emergency.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.440
Open the door. Come on!

02:50.160 --> 02:52.360
-[knocking]
-Oi!

02:53.600 --> 02:55.520
Bruv, we've got
something to show you.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.000
-It's actually mad.
-Have you not been to bed yet?

02:58.040 --> 03:00.880
This is bigger than sleep. We're
at war, bruv. Come through.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.520
Where's your radio?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.520
What the fuck's that?

03:04.560 --> 03:06.960
VR, innit?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.240
-Watch it, watch.
-Bruv, bruv.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.920
Seriously, take a seat.
Take a seat.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.800
-And listen up.
-[radio plays dance music]

03:15.840 --> 03:20.720
<i>Right about now, you're locked
into the sounds of Kold FM
108.6, London's finest.</i>

03:20.760 --> 03:23.120
Kold FM. Brand-new
pirate radio station.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.720
-And they play garage, like us.
-They play garage, same as us.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.840
Same ting, bruv.
Right, this can't run.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.960
-Can't...run.
-Nah.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.680
<i>Let the crew know about
this one - Shazzy Dave...</i>

03:32.720 --> 03:35.200
-Sick tune, as well.
-No, it's not!

03:35.240 --> 03:37.840
-Stop. See, they're even
getting in Steve's head!
-Aaaagh!

03:37.880 --> 03:40.400
[Grindah] <i> What annoys me most</i>
<i>about Kold FM is that...</i>

03:40.440 --> 03:43.520
how do you spell "cold"?
Like C-O-L-D, yeah?

03:43.560 --> 03:47.400
How do you spell "corrupt"?
With a C. I don't know,
like, but with a C.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.800
But we spell it with a K.
Boom! Now these boys
are writing it with a K.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.600
-So "Kold" is spelt with a K?
-That's what I'm saying.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.680
We invented the K.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.600
Come on then, Ange.
Are you excited?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.200
-Hello!
-Hiya. You all right?

04:03.240 --> 04:06.520
This is Jack. He's
an amazing photographer.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.360
He's really the best.
Like, he's brilliant.
He's a miracle worker.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.360
-Best in the area, yeah.
-You'd better come in.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.640
-OK. [laughs]
-Hi, Angel.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.840
How's it going
in the fashion world?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.560
Not too much of that
at the moment.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.000
-Oh, really?
-No, mainly bathroom suites.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.600
Great. Good, yeah.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.760
So what do you want to do
here today, then?

04:23.800 --> 04:26.600
OK, so, today, we're doing,
like, a new family portrait.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.560
And so now I'm, like,
an independent, single mum,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.440
so I want something
that sort of reflects that,

04:30.480 --> 04:33.960
something that's a bit sassy,
maybe a bit feministy.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.240
Something that sort of screams
at you, "I don't need
you any more."

04:37.280 --> 04:39.160
-You know, it's all about me.
-Right.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.600
I did go through a bit of
a bad patch after the break-up.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.800
I just tried to fill the hole
that Grindah left behind

04:44.840 --> 04:47.040
with jacket potatoes
with cheese and beans,

04:47.080 --> 04:49.280
but I've lost that weight now.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.640
Yeah, and I'm feeling better
than ever. I'm thriving.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.080
-Angel, how's Mummy doing?
-Thriving.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.320
Exactly.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.040
-[horn honks]
-Oi!

05:00.080 --> 05:01.960
-Yeah, I'm coming.
-Come on, we've got go.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.720
We're going to war with Kold FM.
Innit, Beats?

05:04.760 --> 05:07.640
-[Chabsie] Big papi!
-Chabsie!

05:07.680 --> 05:09.600
The king cock-sniffer
has arrived!

05:09.640 --> 05:12.320
Kevin, you old slapper!
Jump in the van, mate.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.200
-Ah! Grindah, you all right?
-Yes, that was quick.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.320
-You heard about the war?
-What? What war?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.720
-Radio war.
-We're going to go
and get a highchair.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.840
A highchair?
What's that got...?

05:22.880 --> 05:25.480
How's a highchair going
to save us in a war?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.480
We need to make a plan.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.720
-Tony, mate, listen.
-What are you doing?

05:29.760 --> 05:33.000
You go back to the station.
All right? Keep guard.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.760
When we're finished,
we'll pop down and make sure
everything's all right.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.560
OK. Good. Someone's talking
sense, because I'm
the strongest.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.040
OK, you lot do that. We'll
regroup back at the station.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.200
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right, sweet.
Steves, come on.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.720
Stevie, is he still, you know...
Grindah still living at yours?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.440
[Stevie] <i> It is nice having</i>
<i>Grindah as a housemate.</i>

05:48.480 --> 05:50.840
It's good to have someone
to do drugs with.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.160
A lot of people get weirded
out by me and, like, leave.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.840
But he's got nowhere to go,
so...perfect.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.560
Steves! What are you doing?
I've been talking to you
this whole time!

06:02.600 --> 06:04.200
Sorry, man.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.520
Ready, Ange, come on,
get your coat off!

06:06.560 --> 06:09.600
Great. Just turn
your lights on. Watch.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.960
-It's amazing. God.
-[Jack laughs]

06:12.000 --> 06:14.720
Modelling's a very
luxurious industry, definitely.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.720
It's all about sort of
the glamour and the fame.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.920
You want to have, like,
the perfect lighting.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.320
You want that lovely background
which is all, like, the colours.

06:22.360 --> 06:26.600
Or just all white. Just
stunning. With a wind machine.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.440
This will do it.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.000
-What's that for?
-That's the wind machine.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.880
Ah, let's have a look.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.480
-It was working yesterday.
-Yeah, OK.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.480
[Chabsie] Mate,
I love this place.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.960
[DJ Beats] What?
You've been here before?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, big time.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.080
-Sorry, madam. [chuckles]
-Thanks.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.040
There's a lot of mums
around here, yeah?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.920
Er, yeah, man.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.000
Lot of mums, lot of mums.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.320
This one looks
pretty good, though.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.400
Aw! Jesus! That one.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.960
-Wheels, as well.
-Oh, sick.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.040
Yeah.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.320
[tutting]

07:16.360 --> 07:19.480
-Such a cute baby you have.
-Thank you.

07:20.680 --> 07:24.640
Very... very beautiful, like...
like its mother. [chuckles]

07:27.000 --> 07:30.440
-Trying to buy a highchair?
-Yeah. Actually,
bloody nightmare, innit?

07:30.480 --> 07:34.440
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I've actually
got a plus-size baby, so...

07:34.480 --> 07:36.840
Me, too. Seven months old.
Ten Ton Tessie.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.960
-Oh, Jesus, yeah.
-How old's yours?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
Er... She is...

07:41.240 --> 07:44.720
182 days. Yeah.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.360
[Roche] <i> Kevin's great</i>
<i>with the baby, actually.</i>

07:47.400 --> 07:50.560
He is a bit overprotective
and he does worry a lot.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.080
-Can you give us an example?
-Er, yeah, so...

07:53.120 --> 07:56.080
When he found out that
baby's skulls are soft,

07:56.120 --> 07:59.920
he bought her
this little helmet.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.560
-Have you seen
the baby-proofing area?
-Baby-proofing area?

08:06.600 --> 08:10.000
-Nah.
-Oh, do you want me
to show you where it is?

08:10.040 --> 08:13.360
Janet, I'd like nothing more.
Please, leadeth the way.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.160
-So what have you got so far?
-Absolutely fuck all.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.440
-Oh, right!
-Yeah.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.400
Aaaw!

08:23.440 --> 08:25.200
[he chuckles]

08:26.520 --> 08:29.320
Do you know where
the breast-feeding area is?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.520
Just for my wife, yeah.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.880
No, sorry.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.400
[Grindah] Man, like, Decoy,
you all right, yeah?

08:38.440 --> 08:40.480
Oi, bruv, turn it down.
Turn it down, bruv.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.720
We've got some shit to do. Turn
it down. Bruv, get the phone.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.680
-Yeah, I'll get the phone.
-Decoy, turn it down!

08:46.720 --> 08:48.560
What? But I'm mixing, innit?

08:48.600 --> 08:51.240
I'm trying to deal with
this police ting right now.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.560
-And you're just...
-[radio] <i> 07700900125.</i>

-Yeah?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.240
Beats don't want to come
and help and that, yeah?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.960
We have to deal with this
like real men, do you know
what I'm saying?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.320
-I don't give a fuck at it.
<i>-It's a live caller. Hello?</i>

09:08.360 --> 09:10.080
Yeah.
[gruff voice] Yeah, hello.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.080
We're taking down
your aerial now.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.240
<i>-What?</i>
-Tell him I'm kicking it.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.320
My mate's kicking it
as we speak.

<i>We're still on air, bruv.
We're still on air.</i>

09:18.640 --> 09:22.960
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're not going to be
on air for much longer, mate.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.400
-Yeah, we're taking you down!
-Yeah, you little prick!

09:25.440 --> 09:29.640
We're gonna... We're gonna
petrol bomb your entire station!

09:29.680 --> 09:32.680
-And set you alight.
-And I'm going to piss
through your letterbox.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.040
Obviously, depending on
how much fire there is
around the letterbox area.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.440
Yeah, you fucking dickheads!
[laughs]

09:40.480 --> 09:42.760
We fucking done 'em, the little
mugs, do you know what I mean?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.720
Did we go a bit f...?
Was that a bit weird?

09:44.760 --> 09:47.680
Nah, that was perfect.
Nah, perfect level.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.360
It's good for them to think that
we're going to set them alight.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.200
-Would you listen to Kold FM?
-Nah, they play shit music...

09:54.240 --> 09:57.000
Well, OK, the music
they play is good

09:57.040 --> 09:59.240
because it's the same
music that we play, yeah?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.640
But they play it
in a shitter way.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.080
If you put both of us on, yeah,

10:04.120 --> 10:07.320
and it's both on full volume
on the same make hi-fi,

10:07.360 --> 10:09.280
-on each side of the room...
-We've done this.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.520
..we come out louder.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.400
You're listening to the sounds
of the world-famous MC Grindah,

10:14.440 --> 10:18.000
AKA, no man, woman or child
could ever test we.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.680
-Oh, no.
-Fucking hell!

10:19.720 --> 10:23.600
-Kurupt FM.
-You get me? Trying it, like.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.480
-[Grindah raps]
-Grindah, it's Kold FM.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.400
-What do you mean, it's Kold FM?
-They've just fucking rung back.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.240
What do you mean?
Did you not block the number?

10:30.280 --> 10:32.280
-Shall I say it wasn't...
-Bruv...

10:32.320 --> 10:34.440
-They must've done 1471.
-Yes, you fucking...

10:34.480 --> 10:36.400
Shall I say it wasn't us?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.440
At least that way they
can't track us, innit?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.160
-Yeah, true.
-Decoy, turn it down!

10:44.200 --> 10:46.360
Turn it all off,
turn it all off!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.720
Just act normal.
Decoy, act normal!

10:48.760 --> 10:50.480
-Bruv, I am normal.
-Act normal!

10:54.240 --> 10:56.640
It's so cute!

10:56.680 --> 11:00.480
Octopus pirate. [chuckles]

11:00.520 --> 11:03.640
-Oh, how old?
-Oh, three.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.800
-No, how old are you?
-Eh?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.520
[they laugh]

11:07.560 --> 11:09.200
<i>With Chabuddy G, I like...</i>

11:09.240 --> 11:11.480
all types of women.
I'm a feminist, you know?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.480
Watch out, watch out.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.440
<i>I'm quite into mums at the
moment, you know? Mum play.</i>

11:16.480 --> 11:18.480
I like a woman who's
sexually experienced,

11:18.520 --> 11:22.120
but also a little bit tired,
you know? A bit fed up.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.000
Hello! [laughs]
Do you want a new daddy?

11:25.040 --> 11:28.600
[laughs] Joking! You got a...
You with a partner?

11:28.640 --> 11:31.280
-Yes, yeah...
-Yeah, cool. See you later.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.600
[he sighs]

11:32.640 --> 11:34.240
Very good.

11:34.280 --> 11:38.040
-Are you smizing, Angel?
-Very good. Oh, lovely.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.040
That's brilliant. Yeah.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.400
That's a beautiful smile
you're doing there, Angel.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.320
Do you think Mum
could smile, as well?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.200
Yeah, course.
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.120
OK, ready?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.480
Yeah, just... She's got
a beautiful smile, hasn't she?

11:50.520 --> 11:52.920
-Yeah.
-And that smile's come
from somewhere, ain't it?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.560
-Yeah.
-Give me a big smile as well.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.120
-Yeah. Erm...
-Great.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.040
Let's have a quick look.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.040
OK. Erm...

12:01.080 --> 12:03.520
-Can I see?
-No, sorry.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.200
You need to work on
your posture a bit, Angel.
If you stop slouching, yeah?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.240
And then do some
of your smizing.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.240
Really intensify it. Intensify.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.680
Smizing is basically where
you smile with your eyes
instead of your mouth.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.960
All the sort of
professional models do it,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.680
and also celebrities with
ugly smiles. It's really handy.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.160
Smize.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.280
-Let's check.
That's really nice.
-Thank you.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.320
I might use a couple
of these for the website

12:29.360 --> 12:32.400
-if you're happy with that.
-What? Like, actual modelling?

12:32.440 --> 12:37.080
Did you hear that, Angel? We've
been officially model scouted
by a professional photographer.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.080
Professional models now.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.640
-Yeah.
-Guh.

12:40.680 --> 12:44.640
All right, Steve,
we're moving the station.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.280
Today, now, we're
moving Kurupt FM.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.920
-What?
-Yeah! They're probably coming
for us now in cars and that!

12:50.960 --> 12:55.160
-What, to carjack us?
-If we're not careful,
then, yes, Steve, mate!

12:55.200 --> 12:58.080
Pack up the entire station,
we're moving now.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.040
-Probably just use
Decoy's car or something.
-What?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.840
<i>Is Kold FM a threat to Kurupt?</i>

13:02.880 --> 13:05.040
Kold FM, yeah,
they're not a threat, like,

13:05.080 --> 13:07.520
cos I'm not scared of them
or anything like that, yeah?

13:07.560 --> 13:11.040
They ain't got a fucking clue.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, fuck them Brits.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.280
-Nice one, Decoy!
-Decoy, there's no time.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.200
Just be careful with all
the stuff, it's expensive.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.120
Unplug it all then.
Press stop.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.120
Bruv, come on.
I can't do this on my own.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.160
Fucking hell, hurry up, bruv!

13:21.200 --> 13:23.080
Are you not helping, bruv?
What's wrong with you, bruv?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.760
-Let's go, Decoy!
-Take the transmitter as well.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.640
we've got to move
the station now!

13:27.680 --> 13:30.000
-Have you got stair gates?
-I don't, no.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.240
-These are the good ones, yeah?
-Yeah, they're good.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.120
-My son will go straight
through the cheap ones.
-Oh, how old's your son?

13:35.160 --> 13:38.160
-Er, he's 21.
-Oh, OK.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.320
-Janet?
-Yeah, coming.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.360
-Which corner cushions
do you recommend?
-Erm...

13:44.400 --> 13:47.120
<i>Would you say that you guys
are all getting enough sleep?</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.720
Phtt! Not at all.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.280
Uuuh! Uuuh! It's just
annoying all the time.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.160
You could get up and see your
sister and go, "Can I help?"

13:56.200 --> 13:59.440
-Why am I doing it?
I shouldn't have to do it.
-Who does do it?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.200
-Him.
-Mostly Kevin.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.040
Yeah. I do it.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.240
It's a modern relationship,
so I'm basically the mum.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.920
-Yeah. Yeah, well, yeah,
if you like.
-Yeah.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.840
-This multi-lock will be good
for the fridge and stuff.
-OK, yeah.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.000
OK, and the door stoppers for
the fingers, to protect fingers.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.440
-Yeah, we've got the lot. I
think you've hooked it right up.
-OK. Good.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.840
-Thanks for that, Janet.
Appreciate it.
-Oh, you're welcome.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.000
-Listen. You should, er...
-Are you getting all of that?

14:27.040 --> 14:29.400
-Yeah, hold on.
-[Chabsie whistles]

14:29.440 --> 14:32.600
Put your number in there,
maybe we can link up and
chat about kids again soon.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.880
-Oh, yeah, cool.
-Do you want my number?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.440
Wow!

14:36.480 --> 14:38.560
God, I look... Wow!

14:38.600 --> 14:41.800
Is that really me? [laughs]
Is that really Mummy?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.280
It's like an album cover,
isn't it? Ooh!

14:44.320 --> 14:46.880
-Can we just zoom in on my face?
-Yes.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.760
[Miche] <i> Yeah, I think looks</i>
<i>are really important.</i>

14:48.800 --> 14:50.720
<i>People say don't judge
a book by its cover,</i>

14:50.760 --> 14:53.240
<i>but what else are you
going to judge it on?</i>

14:53.280 --> 14:56.560
You're not going to go up
to someone who you think,
"They look like a boring book."

14:56.600 --> 14:58.640
Or someone who looks like
the Bible, are you?

14:58.680 --> 15:01.120
You're going to go up to
someone that looks like
Now Magazine.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.720
-Do you know when they'll be
up on the website?
-Not yet.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.160
But they're going to go up
on the internet, aren't they?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.240
Yep. There's just the small
matter of payment for today.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.800
Oh, my God! What?
We get paid as well?

15:11.840 --> 15:15.400
-This is too much.
-No.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.280
Sorry. You've got to pay for the
shoot, as you would normally.

15:19.320 --> 15:23.680
Yeah. Of course, yeah, that's
the price of fame, innit? So...

15:23.720 --> 15:26.640
-OK, thank you.
-Lovely, thank you very much.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.200
All right, straight in there.
There's a space there.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.600
Right, Decoy. Swing it in.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.200
-Grindah, child lock's on.
-Yeah, come on.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.000
Are we going to move Kurupt
into Miche's house?

15:39.040 --> 15:42.760
Nah, just got to chat
to her quickly. Let's go.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.480
-That's me first.
-You first.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.360
Why not? As they say in France.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.280
[director] Does Miche know
you've been doing drugs?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.720
I don't think many people know
what I'm doing, do you
know what I mean?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.960
Cos I keep a good lid on it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.880
Still do what I gotta do
and no one can tell
I'm on drugs and that.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.880
So I don't think she's copped.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.680
Fucking hell.
All right, cool. I got this.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.360
I'm chilled, I'm chilled,
I'm chilled, I'm chilled.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.040
-Oh.
-Hey.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.400
Hiya.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.040
What, are you here
for Angel's contact visit?

16:17.080 --> 16:19.600
-It's not today, is it?
-No. I'm not here
for Angel, no.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.640
I'm, er... I just, er...

16:22.680 --> 16:24.920
Is it all right
to use the lock-up?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.200
-The garage?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.440
I was thinking of
getting back into, like,

16:29.480 --> 16:31.960
all my body-building
sort of type stuff.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.040
Oh, right. Great. Yeah, no.
Good for you, yeah.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.000
-Thank you.
-I've been looking after
myself a lot as well recently.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.880
-Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, right. Oh, that's sick.

16:40.920 --> 16:45.920
Yes, you know, it's...
I'm also in the best place
I've ever been, so...

16:47.440 --> 16:49.960
-I'll get the key.
-Cheers, thanks.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.440
[sighs] Fucking hell.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.240
-Did you get the key?
-Yeah.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.400
-Smash it.
-Smash it.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.000
You all right?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.000
-You all right, Steves?
-Oh, yeah.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.160
I didn't know
that he was there.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.480
-Yeah.
-I was always there, just
around the corner a little bit.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.480
The corner, yeah, exactly.
He's here because we...

17:09.520 --> 17:12.640
erm, are going to be doing
body-building together.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.760
So it's my new
weight-training partner.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.240
-Yeah.
-Cos I'm... trying
to get big for summer.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.880
-Exactly. Mm, mm.
-That's it.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.440
-Go for it.
-Thank you. Thank you a lot.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.280
-Have a great time training.
-You have a great time, too.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.080
-Nice to see you.
-Nice day, whatever. Sorry.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.680
Those MILFs. They were teasing
me, man, leading me on!

17:36.720 --> 17:38.520
-You know?
-Yeah.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.720
It's not on.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.960
Right, er...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.600
No, it's cool, man. I've
got it. It's, er... [laughs]

17:47.640 --> 17:49.960
Christ! Look at all
your furniture in there.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.040
Yeah. It's proper neatly
arranged, man. It's like
a living room in there.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.600
Yeah, yeah, I've never noticed
that, actually. That's jokes.

17:57.640 --> 18:02.080
-What a coincidence.
-Yeah, is that
bolted down, yeah?

18:02.120 --> 18:05.600
-Is that a campfire?
-Kevin, I tell you what, mate,
I'll load all this stuff.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.080
You go chill out, mate. Yeah,
yeah, go put your feet up, mate.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.720
Put the radio on or something.
I've got it.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.000
-[director] <i> So how is business?</i>
<i>-Yeah, no, everything's great.</i>

18:15.040 --> 18:16.960
<i>Everything's booming,
really great.</i>

18:17.000 --> 18:20.600
There's a cocktail bar that's
opened right next door, so...

18:20.640 --> 18:24.120
Sod's law. No, it's fine.
It's not a problem.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.360
They're taking all
my customers, actually.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.440
You can have them, you bastards!

18:28.480 --> 18:31.400
It's cool, a bit of competition,
you know? But, yeah...

18:31.440 --> 18:34.080
Definitely haven't
closed down or anything.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.760
Open for business as usual.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.200
-[laughs]
-[Beats] Just dash it.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.400
We need to go check on Grindah.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.480
-Look at that! Kurupt FM 2.0.
-I love it.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.120
-The brand-new home of.
-Is this all it is, yeah?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.960
All it is?! You've got
everything you need here!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.240
Look at the size of it.
It's a joke.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.600
-You've got a sofa,
you've got everything.
-I can basically stand up.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.000
-Boxing bag.
-Ooh! All right, then.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.960
I used to do a lot of boxing
back in the day.
Boxercise classes and that.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.240
-Wham!
-Straight in the belly,
low blow.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.840
Know what I mean? Champion,
mate, here on the floor.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.560
-It this you, yeah?
-Yeah, bruv.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.000
-Look, I'm gone, yeah.
-It's perfect.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.200
-Decoy!
-Grindah, it's you.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.200
-What is it?
-It's your face.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.000
-She's... Is that from there?
-Yeah.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.240
She's kept all
the wedding stuff.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.320
-Whole bag of it.
-She does love me.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.120
She ain't over me yet.
I knew it.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.760
Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:33.800 --> 19:36.560
-Do you reckon you'll
get back with her?
-No.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.480
Pointless now, innit?
On to bigger and
better things, mate.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.160
-What, me?
-No, not you. There's no...

19:45.200 --> 19:48.360
-I meant, like, this.
-Hey, bruv.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.280
Listen, you're forgiven.
Let's go.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.200
No, I can't leave.
All the equipment's in my car.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.720
-I need to go, innit?
-Fuck's sake. Steves, you do it.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.480
-Well, hurry up, man. Shit!
-It's a good idea.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.080
He's such a freak
at the moment, like.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.800
Do you reckon people will be
able to tell we're setting
up a radio station?

20:03.840 --> 20:06.240
Cover the vinyls, Decoy,
cover the vinyls.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.720
-The equipment's in here, innit?
-Oh, it's attached.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.960
-That's attached.
-Help him, Decoy!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.920
-That's attached.
-Help him, Decoy!
Decoy, help him!

20:14.960 --> 20:16.400
-Watch my bumper, man.
-Lift it up!

20:16.440 --> 20:17.800
It's still attached, Decoy.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.880
[Beats] Why's it so quiet?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.520
What the fuck?
Where's all the equipment?!

20:23.560 --> 20:25.760
-Oh, shit. Mate!
-Oh, no.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.640
It looks like you've been
robbed. Everything's gone, mate.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.840
Oh, man! Chabsie!

20:30.880 --> 20:34.080
-Oh, my God, the transmitter!
-What if it was
the rival station?

20:34.120 --> 20:35.920
It's like we've been attacked!

20:35.960 --> 20:37.880
-Come on.
-Oh, God!

20:37.920 --> 20:39.280
Oh, shit!

20:39.320 --> 20:42.080
Decoy, are you all right?

20:43.360 --> 20:44.760
What?

20:44.800 --> 20:46.880
Where's all the fucking
equipment?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.040
You mov...

20:50.080 --> 20:52.480
Bruv, come here now. We need
to do something about Grindah.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.040
This is getting out of hand.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.360
And...

20:57.400 --> 20:59.960
-Ready to go, do you
know what I mean?
-Good to go. Let's shut this.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.040
See you lot in a bit, yeah?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.040
There's a guy
getting in his car.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.400
See you lot in a bit.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.880
No, I think you're going to
have to get out and do it.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.680
-Do it from the other side.
-Yeah, yeah.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.000
-Try and roll under when it's...
-Yeah, yeah.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.240
Right at the last bit,
just roll under.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.360
OK, go!
Steves, I said roll under.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.360
-It's jammed.
-Oh.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.640
All right, hold on, hold on.
Get it back up, get it back up.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.800
I know what we're doing.
We're doing it wrong.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.640
-OK, now, one swift movement.
-Straight down?

21:32.840 --> 21:34.680
-Oh, for f...
-No.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.680
-[Miche] So that's me.
-[Carol] You look beautiful!

21:37.720 --> 21:40.760
-Thank you.
-That's given your confidence
a right boost, innit?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.720
-Oh, look at that one!
-I know.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.680
You look like the absolute
bollocks there, don't you?

21:46.720 --> 21:51.040
-That's completely natural.
Just caught me off guard.
-Totally.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.560
-Boom, you're there.
-Angel looks a bit off there.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.280
-She's not looking her best.
-Well, look.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.000
You could,
you know what I mean?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.280
Cover...
You look beautiful, darling.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.840
You're like... We're a whole
family of models now,
you know that?

22:02.880 --> 22:06.840
I used to do a bit of modelling
for DFS back in the day.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.920
Do you reckon I should change
my Facebook profile to say I'm
a professional model now?

22:10.960 --> 22:16.320
-Definitely!
-Oh, this one, this one.
It's insane, this one.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.920
-Might use that one as
my passport picture, actually.
-Yeah, why not?

22:19.960 --> 22:24.360
[Chabsie] Kevin, do you reckon
you get cash if you get
someone sectioned?

22:24.400 --> 22:27.640
-What?
-He says he's coming. Chabs.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.760
-I'm a bit nervous, man.
Do you think he'll be...?
-Mate, do it. We have to do it.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.880
I can't wait to show Beats!

22:33.920 --> 22:36.320
-Shh! Duck down, though.
-I can't duck and run
at the same time.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.880
I'll knee myself
in the face, mate.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.200
Come on!

22:41.680 --> 22:44.560
-Hello, Tony, mate.
You all right?
-Yeah. No, I'm good.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.040
-Don't think no one
followed us or anything.
-OK, mate.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.400
If you wanna pop yourself
inside and we can have
a nice little chat, yeah?

22:50.440 --> 22:53.000
-Why are you talking like that?
-[Chabsie] Welcome, Tony.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.400
Yes, you lot.
Erm, what's... the fuck?

22:56.440 --> 22:58.720
Why is there chairs everywhere?

22:58.760 --> 23:03.040
-[Steves] Sick, bear chairs.
-Please, take a seat, Tony.

23:03.080 --> 23:07.040
Why do you keep calling me Tony
and why is there chairs
and shit, like?

23:07.080 --> 23:09.400
-This is weird.
-Please... Please, mate.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.440
Listen, we're all here
for you, OK?

23:13.480 --> 23:17.080
Things have got a little bit
out of control.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.360
[Chabsie] You don't know
what you're doing any more.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.760
I know exactly what I'm doing.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.560
-Me and him have been
sorting it all out...
-Tony, Tony, please, please!

23:24.600 --> 23:26.920
-All day we've been working...
-Tony, please.
Don't lash out, OK?

23:26.960 --> 23:31.960
-I'm not...
-We're all your friends, here.
Stevie, Fanty, Decie, Beaty.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.960
All your best mates, for you.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.760
Wait... What...
What the fuck's going on?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.960
This...

23:41.000 --> 23:43.880
-is an inter-wention.
-Yep.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.080
-A what?
-Intervention.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.040
-Inter-wen...
-Vention.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.520
-Wention.
-Vent.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.960
-Vent?
-Wention.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.200
Yeah, intervention.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.480
Does anyone else not know
what an intervention is?

23:57.440 --> 23:59.320
[Chabsie] <i> Everyone</i>
<i>has their low point.</i>

23:59.360 --> 24:02.400
Believe it or not, but I used
to be an addict myself.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.280
I was actually
addicted to Viagra.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.400
And this wasn't even for
Aldona. This was after.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.520
You know, in the club, in the
streets, even in the restaurant.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.880
I just had a raging boner
everywhere I went.

24:13.920 --> 24:18.280
<i>Had to be sat down and talk
about what was happening
to my penis.</i>

24:18.320 --> 24:22.520
Look, man, we're here because
we're worried about you and
we're worried about the station.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.000
Tony, I don't know if you've
noticed because your life's
like a blur at the moment,

24:26.040 --> 24:29.360
but you actually robbed
your own station today.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.240
-What are you talking...
-Did you?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.960
No, I didn't. You've
been with me the whole time!

24:33.000 --> 24:35.040
No, I stopped it
from getting robbed!

24:35.080 --> 24:37.520
I'm the only one doing
anything about this whole war.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.560
Mate, there is no war.
It's all in your head.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.880
-It ain't in my head, it's real.
-It is in your head.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.400
We called them today
by mistake and they're real.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.360
-No, we did call them.
-Yes, we did. We did.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.920
All we're doing is sitting here
in a circle, not doing anything!

24:51.960 --> 24:55.520
Tony, you're being
very defensive and
very aggressive right now.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.720
I'm always defensive and
aggressive! What's wrong
with you people?

24:57.760 --> 25:00.080
How about we go to the hospital
and get your head checked out?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.840
-How about you get
your head checked out?
-I'll take him, split the cash.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.560
What cash? Look, if you lot
think you can deal with radio
yourselves, good luck to you.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.520
And good luck dealing
with the Kold War as well.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.080
Kold War is actually
a sick name for it.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.360
Please don't go, mate. Please!

25:12.400 --> 25:15.000
No, do you know what, yeah?
You lot have made yourselves
perfectly clear.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.400
I'm done with radio. I quit!

25:17.440 --> 25:20.760
Tony, if you run away now,
you'll be running away
for the rest of your life!

25:20.800 --> 25:23.480
Oh, shut up, you ugly freak!
Get out my way.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.520
-[Beats] Please
don't quit, mate.
-You're lucky.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.320
-Just stay, please.
-Get off me!

25:29.360 --> 25:31.960
Tony, you're angry.
Please come back!

25:32.000 --> 25:33.720
[Chabsie sighs]

25:37.800 --> 25:42.120
Do, er... Do I have to have
an intervention now?

25:42.160 --> 25:43.840
No, Steves, you're too far gone.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.760
Yeah. It'd be pointless, Stevie.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.040
Sick.

25:56.080 --> 26:00.480
The station needs me way more
than I need the station,
I'm telling you that now.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.600
I could have been anything,
like. Like, man could
have been like a...

26:03.640 --> 26:05.800
like, a rocket scientist,
do you know what I mean?

26:05.840 --> 26:08.080
But, like, but I didn't, like.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.240
I chose radio. So, do you
know what I mean, like?

26:11.280 --> 26:13.200
They should be grateful.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.600
Chin up, gaffer, you know.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.320
You know that bit in
"Lion King" when Mufasa dies?

26:18.360 --> 26:21.200
-Hm-mm.
-And the little bambino
has to be king?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.440
You're the leader now.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.320
-He's not dead,
though, he's just...
-No, but, I mean, as good as.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.880
Yeah, I wouldn't say
that I'm leaving him behind,

26:28.920 --> 26:32.520
but I'd say that me and Grindah
are just moving at different
speeds at the moment.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.080
I mean, I'm...

26:36.120 --> 26:38.960
you know, moving quickly
and he's on speed.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.200
Yeah, see you later, sad act.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.200
[director]
<i>Is it healthy to move on?</i>

26:45.240 --> 26:47.640
[Miche] <i> Yeah. You shouldn't</i>
<i>just live in the past.</i>

26:47.680 --> 26:50.320
<i>You've got to move on and
start living in the future
or the present.</i>

26:50.360 --> 26:52.440
<i>Do you know why they
call it the present?</i>

26:52.480 --> 26:54.520
Because it's a gift.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.640
-One speaker down.
-Put it on the back seat.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.480
Decoy, you shouldn't have
a car if you don't want to
do stuff like this.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.880
It was doing this earlier.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.240
[Beats] Oh!

27:08.720 --> 27:11.040
Oh, for f...

27:11.080 --> 27:14.000
Craig, you need to be more
careful with this, mate.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.880
[knocking, doorbell rings]

27:16.920 --> 27:19.000
Who the fuck's that?

27:19.040 --> 27:21.480
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.600
All right?

27:24.640 --> 27:27.120
I ain't talking to you, but I
need to stay on your sofa again.

27:27.160 --> 27:32.000
-Is it?
-Yeah, cos it's your fault
that I had to leave radio,

27:32.040 --> 27:33.840
so you made me homeless.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.560
Sorry, man.
Course you can stay.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
