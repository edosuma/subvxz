02:11.634 --> 02:12.868
D'oh!

02:51.757 --> 02:54.759
<i>'Twas Halloween night,</i>
<i>with the kids door-to-dooring,</i>

02:54.794 --> 02:57.896
<i>and all over town</i>
<i>the blood sugar was soaring.</i>

02:59.965 --> 03:01.733
Give me your candy!

03:05.137 --> 03:08.172
<i>But the Simpson abode</i>
<i>was deep down in the dumps,</i>

03:08.207 --> 03:11.743
<i>'cause from little to bigger,</i>
<i>the kids had the mumps.</i>

03:11.777 --> 03:14.779
Now, I'm off to a party,
my outfit is chic.

03:14.813 --> 03:18.116
It's a Catwoman costume,
I'm sure is unique.

03:19.485 --> 03:21.886
Wait a second--
it's Halloween?

03:21.920 --> 03:25.022
Just rest on the sofa,
I'll be home by 10:00.

03:25.057 --> 03:26.457
Can we have some candy?

03:26.492 --> 03:27.792
Just one M&M.

03:32.765 --> 03:34.398
<i>Then we heard a loud crash.</i>

03:34.433 --> 03:35.433
D'oh!

03:35.467 --> 03:37.301
<i>We were tempted to scat.</i>

03:37.336 --> 03:38.870
<i>And we looked</i>
<i>and we saw him...</i>

03:38.904 --> 03:40.371
<i>The Fat in the Hat!</i>

03:40.405 --> 03:43.307
I'll save Halloween for
you three grumpy tots.

03:43.342 --> 03:46.878
Just stick out your rumps
for some mump-stumping shots!

03:48.413 --> 03:51.382
Now hop on my cycle,
there's nothing to fear.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.584
And we shall have candy...
and maybe some beer.

03:53.619 --> 03:54.919
Huh?

03:54.953 --> 03:57.488
You should not be here
when their mother's away!

03:57.523 --> 04:00.658
And you should be dead,
you're so wrinkled and gray!

04:00.692 --> 04:03.427
I'll give you the business,
you yellow sea cow!

04:03.462 --> 04:05.696
This go-getting oldster will...

04:05.731 --> 04:07.331
Where am I now?

04:08.934 --> 04:11.803
We'll fix up this mix-up
in two minutes flat,

04:11.837 --> 04:14.539
with the helpers I've hidden
right under my hat.

04:15.974 --> 04:20.244
I... uh, I knew there was
something I left off my list.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.080
Without food, air and water,
they cease to exist.

06:58.537 --> 07:01.472
<i>So we hitched us a ride</i>
<i>on a three-hump gumbamel!</i>

07:01.506 --> 07:03.908
<i>A gumbamel's a camel</i>
<i>but faster and humbler.</i>

07:03.942 --> 07:06.477
<i>It doesn't take tips</i>
<i>and it's never a grumbler.</i>

07:06.511 --> 07:08.779
So if you must leave
in a kind of a scramble,

07:08.814 --> 07:11.248
then jump on the hump
of a humble gumbamel.

07:11.283 --> 07:13.918
<i>But if the gumbamel should</i>
<i>ramble, then stumble,</i>

07:13.952 --> 07:15.820
<i>then just hop atop</i>

07:38.810 --> 07:41.512

not even hellfires.

07:41.546 --> 07:45.282
Just don't let me ever be played

<i>Now please do not worry,</i>
<i>'cause we did okay.</i>

07:52.657 --> 07:55.793

08:07.966 --> 08:09.334
<i>What the hell?!</i>

08:11.337 --> 08:13.871
Bart, isn't it dangerous
to fly your kite

08:13.906 --> 08:15.473
<i>Stupid kids!</i>
by an airport?

08:15.507 --> 08:16.774
Hey, if they get
on an airbus,

08:16.809 --> 08:18.810
they know they're
taking their chances.

08:21.513 --> 08:22.914
Kite at 2:00!

08:22.948 --> 08:25.116
I don't know what that means,
I have a digital watch!

08:31.490 --> 08:35.293

08:35.327 --> 08:36.294

08:36.328 --> 08:37.495
Homina, homina, homina.

08:37.529 --> 08:38.529
Over.

08:51.844 --> 08:53.544
Nowhere to tie my kite...

08:53.579 --> 08:55.279
and I forgot my scarf.

08:55.314 --> 08:57.815
Bingo!

09:01.920 --> 09:04.522
I'm seeing a 12-car pileup,

09:04.556 --> 09:07.392
a naked rooftop cookout,
and... Oh, my God!

09:07.426 --> 09:09.427
A box kite!

09:11.363 --> 09:14.365
Well, at least
it's a beautiful night.

09:17.803 --> 09:18.836
I'm alive!

09:18.871 --> 09:19.971
All patched up!

09:20.005 --> 09:21.038
End of story.

09:21.073 --> 09:22.607
Actually, there's
a little more.

09:22.641 --> 09:24.342
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

09:24.376 --> 09:26.144
I'm sorry.
This was the only way

09:26.178 --> 09:27.945
to lengthen Bart's
life for a year

09:27.980 --> 09:29.347
while shortening
yours by 30.

09:29.381 --> 09:31.315
I thought I was donating blood.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.018
You are. Along with lymph,
spinal fluid,

09:34.052 --> 09:36.554
and all the trimmings.

09:36.588 --> 09:39.190
But, Lisa, your brain is
still in complete control.

09:39.224 --> 09:43.294
I could do what
I want to Bart's head?

09:43.328 --> 09:44.595
Aw, geez.

09:44.630 --> 09:46.230
Strangle me out
of this, Fatso.

09:46.265 --> 09:47.598
Why you little...!

09:47.633 --> 09:50.401
I'll teach you
to make medical history!

09:50.436 --> 09:52.904
Oops.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.073
Ah, all good.

09:56.108 --> 09:57.074
D'oh!

10:02.981 --> 10:05.149
Hey, boy, since you don't need
a bedroom anymore,

10:05.184 --> 10:08.419
I finally get my man cave.

10:08.454 --> 10:10.221
♪ Man cave!

10:10.255 --> 10:13.224
♪ Everyone's welcome
to my man cave! ♪

10:18.997 --> 10:21.199
I assure you,
we've spared no effort

10:21.233 --> 10:23.000
to accommodate your
special-needs student.

10:23.035 --> 10:25.102
And... done.

10:25.137 --> 10:28.072
So, in conclusion,
my show-and-tell is...

10:28.106 --> 10:29.574
this!

10:29.608 --> 10:32.643
Excellent, Lisa.
A-plus.

10:32.678 --> 10:34.045
Bart, your turn.

10:34.079 --> 10:37.882
Well, my show-and-tell is
that I'm on Lisa's body.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.550
Derivative
and repetitive!

10:39.585 --> 10:40.585
F-minus.

10:40.619 --> 10:42.553
Aw!

10:42.588 --> 10:45.623
Bart, I expected more
from a fourth-grade head.

10:47.526 --> 10:50.394
You're rotating it
in the wrong direction!

10:53.532 --> 10:56.234
That was gonna be
my show-and-tell!

10:56.268 --> 10:58.669
Bart, Lisa,
I'm afraid you two

10:58.704 --> 11:01.339
are going to be together
for a long time.

11:01.373 --> 11:02.893
Why don't you try
to say something good

11:02.908 --> 11:04.609
about each other?

11:04.643 --> 11:06.611
Well, she's pretty
healthy for someone

11:06.645 --> 11:07.778
who's been living
with cooties.

11:07.813 --> 11:09.981
Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean?

11:10.015 --> 11:11.115
Yeah.

11:11.149 --> 11:12.884
It's like looking down
a Canadian tunnel.

11:12.918 --> 11:13.885
What else?

11:13.919 --> 11:15.086
Well... now I always

11:15.120 --> 11:17.121
have someone
to eat lunch with.

11:17.155 --> 11:18.723
Great!

11:18.757 --> 11:21.125
That's as much therapy
as your parents can afford.

11:22.961 --> 11:25.263
I think we've made
some progress here.

11:25.297 --> 11:26.264
Great...

11:26.298 --> 11:27.465
Oh, and I have this

11:27.499 --> 11:29.133
"two heads for one" coupon.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.167
Well, that's for lettuce.

11:30.168 --> 11:31.369
How about this one?

11:31.403 --> 11:32.703
"One random disorder free

11:32.738 --> 11:34.272
with every schizophrenia."

11:34.306 --> 11:35.673
That's mine,
but it's expired.

11:35.707 --> 11:37.341
D'oh!

11:44.349 --> 11:47.018
Should've chopped off
Bart's head long ago.

11:49.755 --> 11:51.088
Sleep well, Lis.

11:51.123 --> 11:52.790
Somehow, sewing my head
on your shoulder

11:52.824 --> 11:54.292
brought us
closer together.

11:54.326 --> 11:55.660
Rainbow...

11:55.694 --> 11:56.827
oh, Rainbow...

11:56.862 --> 11:59.330
Oh... not the pony
dream again.

12:00.198 --> 12:03.334
Hey, <i>I</i> did that.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.337
Yep, that's me.

12:06.371 --> 12:08.005
When she's asleep,

12:08.040 --> 12:09.407
I'm in control.

12:09.441 --> 12:11.542
Lis, I'm gonna make sure

12:11.577 --> 12:13.778
you stay asleep.

12:20.218 --> 12:21.919
Ooh, mix-ins!

12:23.922 --> 12:24.889
Mmm.

12:27.759 --> 12:29.226
Son of a...

12:37.235 --> 12:40.171
You start a car as well
as you start a family.

12:40.205 --> 12:42.707
You wait here while I go
get the jumper cables.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.979
Oh, a panic attack, huh?

12:48.013 --> 12:50.548
Well, I'll give you something
to panic about!

12:55.654 --> 12:57.321
Now I'll just cut off
her annoying head

12:57.356 --> 12:58.990
and this body will be all mine.

12:59.024 --> 13:00.391
Or we both die.

13:00.425 --> 13:02.360
Not really sure
what the rules are.

13:03.395 --> 13:04.729
Why, Bart?

13:04.763 --> 13:06.497
I thought we
were friends.

13:06.531 --> 13:08.733
A brother can never
be friends with his sister.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.568
Are you really,
really sure?

13:10.602 --> 13:11.802
I'm afraid I am.

13:11.837 --> 13:13.938
Well, then, I guess
I have no choice.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.241
How could this
go wrong?

13:17.275 --> 13:18.676
'Cause in a
head-to-head battle,

13:18.710 --> 13:20.277
the one with the
most brains wins!

13:25.584 --> 13:27.485
Well, wherever I am,

13:27.519 --> 13:29.387
it's gotta be an improvement.

13:29.421 --> 13:30.821
Guess again.

13:31.923 --> 13:34.525
Now I can always
sing karaoke duets.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.160
♪ Mock...
Yeah.

13:36.194 --> 13:37.461
♪ Ing...
Yeah.

13:37.496 --> 13:39.497
I feel your pain,
brother.

13:39.531 --> 13:40.831
Now, I need you
to memorize

13:40.866 --> 13:43.467
these 10,000 setups
by next week.

13:43.502 --> 13:44.802
Help me, Doctor.

13:44.836 --> 13:45.970
So this is what

13:46.004 --> 13:47.638
successful post-op
looks like.

13:54.306 --> 13:55.440
<i>Step right up.</i>

13:55.474 --> 13:58.009
Step right up,
only two bits!

Thrill as...

14:08.988 --> 14:11.522
Thrill as Marguerite
conquers the air!

14:20.733 --> 14:22.834
Laugh at the clown's buffoonery!

14:22.868 --> 14:24.135
Seriously, folks,

14:24.169 --> 14:26.638
I really think we should stop
this Hitler guy.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.008
Disbelieve,

14:30.042 --> 14:33.211
as the Strong Man pulls a wagon
with his bare tongue!

14:33.245 --> 14:35.480
♪ This is the song
that you hear at the circus ♪

14:35.514 --> 14:37.815
♪ Sung by a guy
that you see at the circus ♪

14:37.850 --> 14:39.484
♪ Do-do-do, do-do-do

14:39.518 --> 14:40.652
♪ Do-do-do...

14:40.686 --> 14:41.653
D'oh!

14:41.687 --> 14:43.154
Or gape in terror

14:43.188 --> 14:45.290
at Almighty God's
whoopsy-daisies...

14:45.324 --> 14:46.658
the Freaks!

14:49.561 --> 14:51.195
The Human Donkey.

14:51.230 --> 14:52.597
Hee-haw!

14:52.631 --> 14:54.766
The Terrifying Callback.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.267
♪ Mock
Yeah.

14:56.302 --> 14:57.936
♪ Ing...
Yeah.

14:57.970 --> 14:59.837
Creatures from
another galaxy!

14:59.872 --> 15:02.607
Actually, it's more
of a globular cluster.

15:04.109 --> 15:05.510
Not the dark,
not the dark!

15:05.544 --> 15:06.511
Ah!

15:06.545 --> 15:07.812
And now...

15:07.846 --> 15:09.981
I must ask that
small children leave,

15:10.015 --> 15:11.382
good women avert their eyes,

15:11.417 --> 15:13.985
and men take a stiff slug
of circus whiskey.

15:14.019 --> 15:18.189
Behold, the most hideous
creature of all.

15:18.223 --> 15:19.757
How ya doin'?

15:21.193 --> 15:23.294
So, uh, anyone here
from New Jersey?

15:23.329 --> 15:24.862
I'm goin' there
next week.

15:32.037 --> 15:33.171
Whoa!

15:37.743 --> 15:38.776
Hey, torso!

15:38.811 --> 15:39.944
Huh?
What's with the cookies?

15:39.979 --> 15:42.146
Even the human snail
would've been done by now.

15:42.181 --> 15:44.315
I am so sick and tired
of people assuming

15:44.350 --> 15:46.918
that the human snail is,
in some way, slow.

15:46.952 --> 15:48.286
Good day!

15:52.658 --> 15:53.891
All of you!

15:53.926 --> 15:55.560
Get back out there
with your flippers flapping,

15:55.594 --> 15:56.894
and your stumps a-stumping!

15:56.929 --> 15:58.129
Joe and Jane normal

15:58.163 --> 15:59.797
expect some entertainment
for their nickel!

15:59.832 --> 16:01.299
Mr. Burnsum!

16:01.333 --> 16:04.268
You should treat these
poor people with respect!

16:04.303 --> 16:06.237
Marge! Get away
from those freaks.

16:06.271 --> 16:07.638
You belong to me!

16:07.673 --> 16:09.741
The dumb, hairless brute.

16:09.775 --> 16:13.277
Well, you are the best
this circus has to offer.

16:15.447 --> 16:17.782
Taste the strength
of your fiancé.

16:19.785 --> 16:22.020
Ooh!

16:22.054 --> 16:23.654
Ooh...

16:23.689 --> 16:25.890
With the mighty tongue
God's given you,

16:25.924 --> 16:29.494
why can't you speak kindly
of these imperfect angels?

16:29.528 --> 16:32.430
Marge, they knew
what they were getting into

16:32.464 --> 16:34.832
when their parents sold them
to the circus.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.367
Enough!
You will comport yourself

16:36.402 --> 16:37.468
with the dignity expected

16:37.503 --> 16:39.704
of a traveling freak show.

16:42.808 --> 16:44.075
Excuse me, ma'am,

16:44.109 --> 16:47.145
but, uh, I ain't never seen
a normal stand up for us.

16:48.213 --> 16:50.214
I, too, am a freak.

16:50.249 --> 16:51.215
One eye is blue,

16:51.250 --> 16:53.117
and the other
a pale brown.

16:53.152 --> 16:55.520
I wouldn't want to
be you, lady.

16:55.554 --> 16:57.855
Never give up hope,
my friends.

17:00.325 --> 17:02.794
Of all the kisses
I have ever gotten in my life,

17:02.828 --> 17:04.295
that was the first.

17:04.329 --> 17:06.130
Hey, you should
ask her out, Moe.

17:06.165 --> 17:08.633
Ah, but she's sweet
on the strong man.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.867
You're fine unless
Rabbit Ears hears

17:10.903 --> 17:12.436
and tells Big Mouth.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.540
Wha...?!

17:16.575 --> 17:19.377
I ain't got no chance
with the strong man's girl.

17:19.411 --> 17:20.877
He makes ten dollars a week

17:20.913 --> 17:22.480
plus all the sawdust he can eat.

17:22.513 --> 17:24.147
Well, you've got
an emerald ring.

17:25.651 --> 17:26.851
My mother's ring.

17:27.886 --> 17:29.821
She gave it to me
on her deathbed.

17:29.855 --> 17:31.856
She also acquired it
on her deathbed.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.724
That was a very busy deathbed.

17:33.759 --> 17:35.359
With an emerald that big,

17:35.394 --> 17:36.861
I could buy anything.

17:36.895 --> 17:38.729
A jalopy, an icebox,

17:38.764 --> 17:40.898
a steamer trunk full of fedoras!

17:40.933 --> 17:43.401
But how do I get my hands on it?

17:43.435 --> 17:45.002
Oh, I'm an idiot!

17:45.037 --> 17:46.003
Of course!

17:46.038 --> 17:47.371
I get Marge to marry Moe,

17:47.406 --> 17:48.473
then I kill Moe,

17:48.507 --> 17:49.607
then she gets the ring,

17:49.641 --> 17:51.275
then I marry her
and the ring is mine.

17:51.310 --> 17:54.145
And the brilliance of my plan
is its simplicity.

17:55.314 --> 17:57.782
You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

17:57.816 --> 18:01.119
<i>You're</i> gonna be sorry
you said that.

18:01.153 --> 18:02.854
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

18:02.888 --> 18:06.624
whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh...

18:06.658 --> 18:08.693
I just lost my keys!

18:08.727 --> 18:10.428
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

18:10.462 --> 18:13.397
What do you know?
I <i>am</i> gathering moss!

18:14.766 --> 18:17.135
Hey, Marge, you want
to marry Moe?

18:17.169 --> 18:19.504
I'm engaged
to you, my love.

18:19.538 --> 18:22.106
The poor, lonely fellow
is about to die.

18:22.141 --> 18:23.508
Really? How?

18:23.542 --> 18:25.409
Well, let me
worry about how.

18:25.444 --> 18:28.246
But you know, you could make
his last day a happy one.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.548
And the ring is just
the icing on the cake.

18:30.582 --> 18:31.749
What ring?

18:31.783 --> 18:34.585
The ring that'll get me
out of this lousy circus

18:34.620 --> 18:36.154
and into a good circus.

18:36.188 --> 18:37.421
Now, let's get you married.

18:37.456 --> 18:39.524
But wouldn't you
be jealous, my love?

18:39.558 --> 18:42.059
Dear, I am not
the jealous type.

18:42.094 --> 18:44.061
And from you,
I have learned

18:44.096 --> 18:47.298
to feel compassion
for these disgustos.

18:47.332 --> 18:48.766
Aw...

18:48.800 --> 18:52.303
♪ She's a superfreak

18:52.337 --> 18:54.438
♪ Superfreak

18:54.473 --> 18:57.441
♪ She's superfreaky

18:57.476 --> 18:59.010
♪ Yow.

18:59.044 --> 19:00.178
"Yow" indeed.

19:00.212 --> 19:01.312
And so, with the conclusion

19:01.346 --> 19:02.647
of our traditional wedding song,

19:02.681 --> 19:04.182
I now declare you

19:04.216 --> 19:05.616
husband and wife.

19:05.651 --> 19:08.553
Moe, whatever small time
together we have

19:08.587 --> 19:10.788
will be wonderful.

19:11.957 --> 19:13.491
A very small time!

19:13.525 --> 19:15.359
Those are strange
things to say,

19:15.394 --> 19:17.929
but a wedding is no place
to worry about threats

19:17.963 --> 19:19.630
from the bride's former lover.

19:19.665 --> 19:20.965
Now, the toast.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.266
To you, Marge.

19:22.301 --> 19:23.868
Now you are
one of us.

19:23.902 --> 19:25.636
One of us!

19:25.671 --> 19:27.638
Gooble goo!

19:27.673 --> 19:29.707
One of us!

19:29.741 --> 19:31.375
Gooble goo!

19:31.410 --> 19:33.811
Why is it company parties
always get weird?

19:36.448 --> 19:37.548
God, you are
so beautiful

19:37.583 --> 19:38.783
in that
peignoir there.

19:38.817 --> 19:41.152
I, uh, better
freshen up a little bit.

19:44.156 --> 19:45.556
Set it to "massage," Jumbo.

19:51.096 --> 19:52.830
Hmm? What
are you doing?

19:52.864 --> 19:55.199
Oh! Trying
to kill Moe

19:55.234 --> 19:57.034
so we'll get
his emerald!

19:57.069 --> 19:58.302
By the way,
I haven't checked,

19:58.337 --> 19:59.570
but emeralds
are valuable, right?

20:00.639 --> 20:02.139
Strong Man!

20:02.174 --> 20:04.475
Moe may be ugly
on the outside,

20:04.509 --> 20:07.745
but inside, you are
the true monster.

20:07.779 --> 20:09.680
Leave my trailer forever!

20:09.715 --> 20:11.082
<i>You're</i> rejecting <i>me?</i>

20:11.116 --> 20:15.419
But I'm in the best shape
anyone is in the 1930s.

20:15.454 --> 20:16.754
I said go!

20:21.093 --> 20:22.360
One of us!

20:22.394 --> 20:23.361
Gooble goo!

20:23.395 --> 20:24.595
One of us!

20:24.630 --> 20:25.830
Gooble goo!

20:25.864 --> 20:27.765
What the hell does
"gooble goo" mean?

20:27.799 --> 20:28.966
We don't know!

20:29.001 --> 20:30.034
Gooble goo!

20:30.068 --> 20:31.235
We don't know!

20:31.270 --> 20:32.270
Gooble goo!

20:35.407 --> 20:36.641
You killed Burnsum!

20:36.675 --> 20:38.909
Now who is gonna say,
"Step right up"?

20:38.944 --> 20:41.212
Gooble goo! Gooble goo!

20:41.246 --> 20:42.780
Tar and
feather him!

20:42.814 --> 20:45.049
Tear off his drumsticks!

20:45.083 --> 20:47.184
Make him...
one of us!

20:47.219 --> 20:48.753
One of us!

20:48.787 --> 20:50.554
One of us!
This is exactly why

20:50.589 --> 20:52.690
circus attendance is plummeting!

20:52.724 --> 20:56.594
And that, kids, is
how I met your mother.
