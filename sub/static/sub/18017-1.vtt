WEBVTT

00:24.624 --> 00:27.593
- Sinner, sinner,
sinner, sinner!

00:27.595 --> 00:30.029
- I said turn that
thing off and find him!

00:30.031 --> 00:30.963
Whoa whoa whoa!

00:30.965 --> 00:32.296
Oh there he is, there he is!

00:32.299 --> 00:33.499
- Are you rolling?

00:33.501 --> 00:34.700
Okay, let's get
the coach, come on.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.667
- Okay,
grab him, grab him!

00:35.669 --> 00:36.969
Get his legs, get his legs!

00:36.971 --> 00:37.936
- Excuse me, can you
give me some comment

00:37.938 --> 00:38.904
on what happened tonight?

00:38.906 --> 00:39.738
- Oh, grab his hands!

00:41.108 --> 00:42.775
- Western Indiana
university's homecoming game.

00:42.777 --> 00:43.909
It's been a stellar season

00:43.911 --> 00:46.311
for the timberwolves'
quarterback,

00:46.313 --> 00:48.680
virtually certain to win the
heisman trophy this year,

00:48.682 --> 00:51.016
but all those dreams came
crashing down amid scandal-

00:53.387 --> 00:55.120
... ous rumors of
sexual deviation

00:55.122 --> 00:57.890
at this highly
religious university.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.893
- As we reflect
on last night's events,

01:00.895 --> 01:04.997
it is important to remember
that for every one verse

01:04.998 --> 01:09.168
about god's grace and love
and mercy, compassion,

01:09.170 --> 01:13.238
there are also two verses
about god's vengeance

01:14.275 --> 01:16.308
and his wrath

01:16.310 --> 01:17.509
and his hatred of sinners.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.377
Smear the queer!

01:28.288 --> 01:32.324
- And that may remind
you of an amazing gift,

01:32.326 --> 01:35.828
a gift that he has given us.

01:35.830 --> 01:39.898
Do you know it?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.667
I would hope so.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.102
- Amen.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.503
- It's his
written word, the Bible,

01:44.505 --> 01:46.638
our playbook for
life's challenges,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.373
and like god, who was this--

01:48.375 --> 01:49.341
- stop.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.809
- This great architect,

01:50.811 --> 01:53.679
we must follow the
examples of the Bible

01:53.681 --> 01:57.282
to expose sin and sinners
for what they are.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.318
- Look, there she is.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.886
- We want
to warn the nation,

02:00.888 --> 02:02.421
let them know that--
- she's so weird.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.857
- God is not going
to let this country get by,

02:04.859 --> 02:07.126
and for that, we praise god.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.333
- Nice backpack.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.268
Did your moms get
that for you, Curtis?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.102
- Curtis?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.704
More like turd-is!

02:18.706 --> 02:20.873
- Turd-is?

02:20.875 --> 02:23.842
Oh my god, that's awesome.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.010
Emily turd-is.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.279
That's what we're gonna
call you from now on.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.951
- Can I please pass?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.520
- "Can I please pass?"

02:34.522 --> 02:38.824
- Paula, Annabelle, report
to homeroom immediately.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.225
- Yes, Mr. Thompson!

02:40.227 --> 02:44.196
- Thank you.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.497
- Turd-is.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.832
Teacher's pet.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.078
15 seconds left.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.148
Third down, ball on the
pirates' 30 yard line.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.583
- Klein
hoping to get some protection

03:04.585 --> 03:05.984
from an offensive line

03:05.986 --> 03:08.420
that's been beaten
consistently all evening.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.689
Klein drops back.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.523
Levy is open.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.958
Oh ho ho!

03:12.960 --> 03:15.627
- Too much air under that one.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.929
All right, fourth down.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.597
- Timberwolves down
to their last chance.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.832
Nine seconds remain.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.035
- Klein
facing very first loss ever

03:23.037 --> 03:24.937
in an illustrious
college career.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.338
- Jude Jude
Jude Jude Jude Jude!

03:26.340 --> 03:27.940
- All right, klein,
trust your instincts.

03:27.942 --> 03:30.209
Have faith.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.211
You see an opportunity
you take it, all right?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.478
- Ready, break!

03:33.480 --> 03:34.913
- The
game's in your hands.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.081
- All
right, the coach giving klein

03:36.083 --> 03:37.316
some words of
encouragement there.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.817
A lot's riding on this.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.053
- So it
all comes down to this play.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.754
Such a nail biter.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.789
There's someone in motion there.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.428
- Jude Jude Jude Jude
Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude!

03:49.430 --> 03:50.829
Receiver in motion.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.998
Now, two receivers on each side.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.533
The crowd is on their feet!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.835
- Now
this is what it's all about.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.503
- All right, come on!

03:58.505 --> 03:59.638
- Come on, you jealous?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.939
- Aw, shut up.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.176
- Klein surveying the field,

04:04.178 --> 04:05.110
checking down.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.745
Now the receiver in motion.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.120
Klein is dropping back!

04:16.123 --> 04:19.124
The pirates are flipping!

04:19.125 --> 04:20.058
- Run it!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.059
- Klein throws the ball down

04:21.060 --> 04:22.261
and starts to run!

04:22.263 --> 04:24.696
35, 30.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.298
Sidestep to tackle!

04:26.300 --> 04:27.132
25!

04:27.134 --> 04:28.600
20!

04:28.602 --> 04:29.434
- Go!

04:29.436 --> 04:30.269
Come on!

04:30.271 --> 04:31.937
Go go go go go!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.605
Get the block, 15!

04:33.607 --> 04:34.640
Klein's going for it!

04:34.642 --> 04:35.474
Look at that!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.442
- Pass to the five!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.519
Touchdown!

04:47.521 --> 04:48.787
Oh my god!

04:48.789 --> 04:50.589
I don't believe what I just saw.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.525
Jude klein just pulled
a proverbial victory

04:53.527 --> 04:55.060
from a sure defeat.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.928
- What
a general on that field!

04:56.930 --> 04:59.831
Wolves 20, pirates 19.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.066
Her streak continues!

05:01.068 --> 05:02.000
I would say this crowd's

05:02.002 --> 05:03.035
got everything and more tonight.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.569
- That's my girlfriend!

05:04.571 --> 05:05.504
- Saint
Jude does her victory dance

05:05.506 --> 05:07.372
to the delight of her fans.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.740
- Well,
let's just hope the men's team

05:08.742 --> 05:10.575
now can catch some
of Jude's fire.

05:10.577 --> 05:13.211
Yesterday's loss puts
them at oh and four,

05:13.213 --> 05:17.182
thanks to bill "butterfingers"
Bradley's three fumbles.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.284
- Feel
the love on that field tonight!

05:19.286 --> 05:22.454
The mvp is not stopping
tonight, no way.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.689
Jude!

05:23.691 --> 05:26.992
That's the pros
calling you, girl!

05:37.603 --> 05:42.107
- Do you have anything else
to confess in god's name?

05:42.109 --> 05:46.011
- No, but there's something
else I want to talk about

05:46.013 --> 05:49.948
if that's okay.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.118
- Proceed, my child.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.722
- I feel like I only
live for my fans,

05:56.724 --> 06:01.093
like everybody only knows Jude
klein, the football player,

06:01.095 --> 06:05.697
not Jude klein, the real person.

06:05.699 --> 06:10.102
It just feels like
nobody knows who I am.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.536
You know what I mean?
- Kelly!

06:11.538 --> 06:12.738
- Hi, how are you?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.440
- Like I'm going
through the motions.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.476
Not really connected to it.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.710
- I really
like your dress.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.313
- But you have to trust
in god's path for you,

06:21.315 --> 06:25.884
and accept his journey for
you that's tailor-made.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.552
Bless you, Jude.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.820
You're gonna do god's work.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.654
- Hey, good game.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.589
- Oh, thank you.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.790
- Chug, chug, chug!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.058
- Mouth
to spout, right boys?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.126
- Mouth to
spout, mouth to spout.

06:34.128 --> 06:34.926
- That's mouth to spout.
- He got it.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.927
- On your knees, pledge.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.396
You ready?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.430
- Go easy on him, okay?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.364
- Yeah.
- We got you, brother.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.298
- Come on, let's go.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.099
- Chug, chug, chug!

06:41.101 --> 06:43.535
- I said easy, bill.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.003
Man, slow down.

06:45.005 --> 06:45.937
- Who cares?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.439
- Come on, he's just a pledge.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.273
Come on fatty, let's go.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.408
- Dude, sorry.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.242
Hey, come on.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.076
I got it.

06:51.078 --> 06:51.910
Go, go.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.744
Come on.

06:52.746 --> 06:58.884
- Jude, Jude, come here.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.852
- Hey, look, I know he
can be a bit of a dick,

07:00.854 --> 07:05.323
but in my mind, you're already
an official otp, all right?

07:05.325 --> 07:06.658
- Whatever.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.526
- I got you.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.761
- Okay.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.096
- Okay, we'll
we're gonna mingle.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.030
It was really good to see you.
- Okay, have fun.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.665
Hey, great game today, Jude.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.468
- Oh, thank you.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.903
- Do you think next time,

07:17.905 --> 07:19.771
maybe you could just
pretend to be interested?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.039
Those kind of girls
really make or break me

07:21.041 --> 07:23.208
for homecoming queen.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.042
- Okay.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.211
- Thank you.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.446
- Why don't you take a lap,

07:27.448 --> 07:28.880
and I'm gonna go
find the bathroom.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.449
- Okay, well come back quick.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.683
It's a little easier to mingle

07:31.685 --> 07:35.153
when you have the star
quarterback on your arm.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.087
Okay, be quick.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.289
Ugh, you taste like chips.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.830
- Oh, this is great.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.131
You in line?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.132
- Yeah.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.367
I'm the last man.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.803
- That's a long line.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.105
- Yeah.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.475
There's another bathroom on
the other side of the house.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.544
- I don't want to face
the crowd again.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.378
It never ends.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.279
- Jude klein?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.214
- Mm.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.148
- Can I get a picture?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.216
Can you take our picture?

08:04.218 --> 08:08.320
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course, of course.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.855
- Smile.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.689
Okay.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.523
- Thanks so much.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.357
- Yeah.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.327
- Call me.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.463
- Oh my god, so
embarrassing.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.565
- Hey, you're a popular girl.

08:20.567 --> 08:24.035
- Would've been a different
story if I lost the game.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.237
- Yeah,

08:25.239 --> 08:26.738
but you actually
haven't lost a game

08:26.740 --> 08:29.608
since your freshman
year at victory high,

08:29.610 --> 08:32.443
where you started
all four seasons,

08:32.446 --> 08:33.678
and then you were recruited

08:33.679 --> 08:36.214
by all of the big
conference schools,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.717
and now, here you are,

08:38.719 --> 08:44.121
star quarterback of the
western indy timberwolves,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.724
and now you're gonna lead them

08:45.726 --> 08:51.863
to their potentially first
undefeated season ever.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.265
- I'm sorry, who are you?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.200
- I'm Ryan Morris.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.668
Sports journalism.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.670
I'm actually doing a cover
story on you for the observer.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.705
- Oh really, a cover story, huh?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.008
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, pledge.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.409
You in line?

09:04.411 --> 09:05.777
- Yes.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.813
But you can take
my spot, brother.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.949
- Hey, we're not your
brothers, pledge.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.185
We're your betters.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.387
- Right.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.255
Sorry if I offended you.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.557
- Sorry to interrupt, you guys,

09:18.559 --> 09:21.893
but I've been trying
to get in touch with...

09:21.895 --> 09:23.128
- Ryan.
- Ryan all week

09:23.130 --> 09:26.364
about the story for the
paper that he's doing.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.333
- Oh, sorry, Jude.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.035
I didn't recognize
you out of uniform.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.403
Awesome game today.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.737
- Oh, thanks bill.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.006
Hey I saw your
playback of the game.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.241
You got totally screwed, dude.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.143
They should've thrown
a flag on that play.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.413
- Yeah, well, once the media
labels you butterfingers

09:41.415 --> 09:44.115
you can't really come
back from that, so.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.250
But thanks anyway.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.086
- Mm-hmm.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.356
See you later, boys.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.592
- Thank you so much.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.960
There's nothing like
drunk frat boys.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.094
- That's because
you haven't been

09:56.096 --> 09:58.330
around drunk sorority girls.

09:58.332 --> 09:59.164
- Mm.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.268
- Excuse me.
- Hey,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.303
I'll let you go ahead of me.

10:05.305 --> 10:12.077
Only if you let
me interview you.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.812
- Okay.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.981
Tomorrow after practice?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.015
- Okay.

10:17.017 --> 10:21.286
- Cool.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.723

<i>jambo.</i>.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.460
Welcome to the neighborhood.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.628
We brought muffins.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.895
- Thank you.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.263
- I'm Karen Curtis.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.331
This is my daughter, Emily.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.165
- Hi.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.800
- Hi.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.635
- It's a bad time?

10:36.637 --> 10:37.469
We can come back.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.303
- Oh, no.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.504
I'm sorry.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.006
Please come in.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.510
- Hope you like bran.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.346
- Mm.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.048
Please excuse the mess.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.349
We're still settling in.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.018
- Oh, no, don't worry.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.787
Moving in is such a nightmare,
especially with children.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.088
Do you have kids?

10:57.090 --> 11:00.291
- Not yet, but we're
talking about it.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.226
- Nice.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.895
Which one of you is gonna carry?

11:03.897 --> 11:07.832
- Oh, definitely me.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.234
- Me too.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.235
I loved it.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.603
We both did, actually.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.538
Having a kid is a
wonderful experience.

11:13.540 --> 11:19.678
- Mom, look at how
pretty this picture is.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.013
- Oh.
- Honey?

11:22.015 --> 11:22.947
You seen my keys?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.149
The nurse just called.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.584
She's awake, so I need
to get over there.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.386
- I think we caught
you at a bad time.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.422
- Honey, look what the
neighbors brought us.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.389
Muffins.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.225
- Well, that's very neighborly.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.862
- Well, I'll let you
finish what you're doing.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.198
- Sorry, I'm on call
this weekend, so--

11:40.200 --> 11:43.902
- but maybe next week
we can have dinner?

11:43.904 --> 11:46.171
- Yeah, sure.

11:46.173 --> 11:50.041
I do have to check with my wife.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.009
We have very busy schedules.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.310
But I will get back to you.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.979
Come on, Emily.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.481
- Nice meeting you.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.149
- It was really
nice to meet you too, Emily.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.818
- Take care.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.587
- When are we gonna
have dinner with them?

12:02.589 --> 12:05.990
- Sweetie, I'm sorry,
that's not gonna happen.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.425
- Why not?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.627
- Well, it just can't.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.696
- But you said you wanted
to make them feel welcome.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.966
- I did,
but that was before.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.201
- Before what?

12:16.203 --> 12:20.605
- Before i
knew they were 'ros.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.173
- What's a 'ro?

12:22.175 --> 12:26.444
- Heterosexual.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.580
- What's a heterosexual?

12:28.582 --> 12:32.016
- Something you're
too young to know about.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.485
I'm okay with it,

12:33.487 --> 12:35.153
but your mother would
never associate with them.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.187
Come on.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.923
- I know, but why?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.860
- Why is there sky?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.294
- I don't know,
because god made one?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.462
- Good answer.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.930
- God blesses
you on this day,

12:45.932 --> 12:49.267
and forgives all those
that ask his forgiveness.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.069
Proceed, my child.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.906
- Since our last
conversation, I just,

12:54.908 --> 12:57.008
I decided to let
go of expectation

12:57.010 --> 13:00.478
and be a little bit more
like I am on the field,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.981
present, you know what I mean?

13:02.983 --> 13:06.151
I feel like my life is,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.887
it's like a big
practice session,

13:08.889 --> 13:10.488
like I keep waiting
for the big game,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.690
and the game never comes.

13:12.692 --> 13:16.261
- Give yourself to the
fervor of his word,

13:16.263 --> 13:21.366
and comfort yourself
in your faith.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.334
- Okay.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.770
You're on the field.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.873
And your focus is on the ball.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.942
Your adrenaline surges
as the ball snaps.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.146
- All right, all right, I'm
seeing a lot of heart out there.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.414
I like heart.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.248
Hit the showers.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.082
Get some rest, ladies.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.350
That's it.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.619
- Your hands sting from
the impact of the ball.

13:41.621 --> 13:46.758
There's just nothing else
that makes me feel more alive.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.728
You scan the field
for a receiver.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.431
Your heart starts pounding,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.767
because you can feel the
defense closing in on you.

13:55.769 --> 13:59.237
It takes me beyond
anything in my real life.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.573
I wish life was like that.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.641
Did you get all that?

14:03.643 --> 14:06.444
- Yeah, it's great.

You have to actually
throw the ball.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.821
- I tried, coach.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.656

14:51.658 --> 14:54.058
or maybe try drama
club, I don't know.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.160
- My moms want me
to play football.

not for everyone.

wanna see some jumps

15:10.343 --> 15:11.276

Turn around towards
the bleachers so they
don't see you cry.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.319
She can be really
mean sometimes.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.721
At least she didn't yell at
you in front of everybody.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.991
That's the worst.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.526
- Did she do that to you?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.460
- Yeah.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.262
Told me I was so uncoordinated

15:31.264 --> 15:35.233
even Jesus wouldn't
want to play with me.

- Faster!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.240
You call that running?!

15:42.242 --> 15:45.510
- So how'd you end up being
the equipment manager?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.779
- My dads begged the coach
not to cut me from the team,

15:47.781 --> 15:51.883
so she made me the towel
boy of the girls' team.

15:51.885 --> 15:52.750
- Sorry.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.319
- It's okay.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.487
I don't listen to her when
she's really mean like that.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.858
Neither should you.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.360
- I know it's kinda dorky,

16:02.362 --> 16:05.563
but sometimes I wish the
school had a croquet team.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.698
I'm good at that.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.408
I don't care.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.910
Bring it on, please.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.145
What's her problem anyway?

18:34.147 --> 18:36.781
Why is she so fixated
on the hetero issue?

18:36.783 --> 18:42.053
- You don't know?

18:42.055 --> 18:43.121
- If I knew, i
wouldn't have asked.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.589
What?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.490
- I go, okay.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.024
- What?

18:47.026 --> 18:53.064
- Her sister left her wife for
the church handyman.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.799
Left the entire family.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.733
- You're kidding me?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.335
- Now, they don't tell people,

18:57.337 --> 18:59.303
but a few of us are in the know.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.340
They keep it quiet.

19:02.342 --> 19:06.677
- The reverend's
sister is hetero.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.045
Maybe she's worried
it runs in the family.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.547
- Right?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.282
So you be careful, my little
rebel with a cause, all right?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.151
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.521
- Now, dinner.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.023
- Mm, what about pizza?

19:19.025 --> 19:20.958
"With all the admired
beauties of verona go thither

19:20.960 --> 19:22.527
"and with unattainted eye,

19:22.529 --> 19:25.496
"compare her face with
some that I shall show."

19:25.498 --> 19:26.764
- Get it.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.634
- "And I will make thee
think thy swan a grow."

19:35.675 --> 19:36.908
- We support people

19:36.910 --> 19:38.342
so they feel like
they are not alone.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.877
Hi, really nice to meet you.

19:39.879 --> 19:44.048
- You're disgusting.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.484
- Gross.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.718
- Oh, hey guys.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.586
Kel wanted me to tell
you to vote for her.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.420
Don't forget.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.454
You don't have to.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.889
- She got my vote.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.392
- Yeah, mine too, but only
because she's your girl, klein.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.326
- Yeah, yeah.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.461
All right, I'll see you guys.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.396
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.130
- We gotta get to class.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.432
- Excuse me?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.667
Hi.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.734
Sorry, I didn't
mean to eavesdrop,

20:03.736 --> 20:05.136
but I heard you saying

20:05.138 --> 20:07.071
that your girlfriend's
running for homecoming queen.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.773
- Oh yeah, Kelly Williams.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.241
- Yeah, I've seen
her posters around.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.843
So you must be Jude klein?

20:12.845 --> 20:13.711
- That's me.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.179
- Jude klein.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.314
I'm Susan Miller.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.950
I'm director of the hac.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.184
- Oh.

20:20.186 --> 20:20.985
Well, it was really
nice to meet you,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.253
but I should get going.

20:22.255 --> 20:26.224
- Oh, hey, listen, do
you know Collin Reese?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.658
- Yeah, he's the
best quarterback

20:27.660 --> 20:28.926
of the men's league.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.928
- Well, he just became a
member of the alliance,

20:30.930 --> 20:32.530
and he's a good friend of mine.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.600
- Wow, he supports
hetero rights?

20:35.602 --> 20:38.069
- Yeah, he better.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.503
He just came out.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.938
- They're still
letting him play?

20:40.940 --> 20:43.407
- The world is changing, Jude,

20:43.409 --> 20:45.543
slowly, but, but it's changing.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.777
- Hey, Jude.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.312
- If you could
join the alliance,

20:48.314 --> 20:50.748
or someone like you,
it would mean so much--

20:50.750 --> 20:52.283
- no.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.885
I'm not gay.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.454
- Oh, you know, you
don't have to be hetero

20:56.456 --> 20:57.388
to be in the alliance.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.222
It's just to support--

20:58.224 --> 20:59.056
- sorry, sorry.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.759
- Jude!

21:01.761 --> 21:04.428
I'm so sorry.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.930
You okay?
- Thanks.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.098
It's probably just a sprain.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.800
- Is there anything
i can get you?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.035
- No, thank you.

21:11.037 --> 21:11.869
I'll just walk it off.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.137
- Are you sure?

21:13.139 --> 21:13.938
I didn't break the
star quarterback?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.439
- No, that's fine.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.140
- Well, maybe you should
just walk her to the dorm,

21:16.142 --> 21:20.044
just to be safe.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.346
- Yeah.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.581
- Well, okay.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.750
- Do you need
help or something?

21:35.093 --> 21:37.828
- Hi, did you get a button?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.230
Here you go, vote for Kelly.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.064
Thank you.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.666
Vote Kelly.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.800
Did you get a button?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.001
- What's with the jugs?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.070
- Some pledge
thing, I don't know.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.004
It's supposed to build stamina?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.539
- Stupid.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.074
- Thank you, thank
you, ego boost.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.882
So, what were you
doing at that booth?

21:57.884 --> 22:01.118
- It was some
heterosexual rights club

22:01.120 --> 22:03.354
or something like that.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.356
- Oh.

22:05.358 --> 22:11.028
I started a club like
that in high school.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.531
- Really?

22:13.533 --> 22:14.665
- Yeah.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.100
- Wow.

22:16.102 --> 22:21.038
Well, that was very
progressive of you.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.773
- My moms didn't think so.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.608
They freaked out, actually.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.844
They're really religious, so.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.945
- You're not?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.280
- No.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.315
- But you go to a
religious university?

22:31.317 --> 22:36.554
- Well, it was the only
scholarship I got, so here I am.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.688
- This one's broken.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.456
- Okay, well how
am I supposed to give--

22:38.458 --> 22:39.256
- vote Kelly!

22:39.258 --> 22:40.191
Here, take a button.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.859
Thanks for coming.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.261
How am I supposed to give these
out if they're broken, Kim?

22:44.263 --> 22:46.063
- Oh, they must be
really proud of you.

22:46.065 --> 22:49.200
- I don't talk to them much.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.602
- Jude, hey!

22:51.604 --> 22:52.436
- Hey.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.404
- Hey.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.238
- What's going on, man?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.239
- How's my golden girl?

22:55.241 --> 22:56.273
What's going on with your leg?

22:56.275 --> 22:57.241
- Oh, nothing, I tripped.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.576
I sprained it.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.577
- You okay?

22:59.579 --> 23:01.045
- So pink, hot pink, or--

23:01.047 --> 23:02.279
- hot pink, light
pink, whatever,

23:02.281 --> 23:03.347
just make sure they're pink.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.382
- Yes, I'm good.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.216
- Should I call coach?

23:05.218 --> 23:06.183
- No, no.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.017
- You sure?

23:07.019 --> 23:07.918
- Yes, I'm good.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.786
- Okay.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.455
Come here.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.457
Hey, promise me you'll see
the trainer in the morning?

23:13.459 --> 23:14.325
- You got it.

23:14.327 --> 23:15.159
- Love you.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.495
- Love you.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.096
- He's a big guy.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.564
- Yeah, he is.

23:20.566 --> 23:24.402
He's actually my
offensive coordinator.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.236
Calls all the plays.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.070
He's awesome.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.039
He's got my back.

23:29.041 --> 23:33.444
Hey, I could set
you up with him.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.646
- Oh, no.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.547
That's okay.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.949
He's not really my type.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.452
- Oh, okay.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.286
- Make sure you vote.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.220
- Okay.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.155
- Vote's coming up really soon.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.256
Thank you, I'll text you later.

23:45.258 --> 23:50.194
- All right.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.028
- I'll see ya.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.930
- All right.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.864
Bye.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.273
- There's Jude.

24:02.275 --> 24:06.844
- Hey, that's Jude.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.280
- Jude!

24:09.282 --> 24:10.314
Hi.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.749
- Hi, babe.

24:11.751 --> 24:12.683
What are you doing here?

24:12.685 --> 24:13.951
- Was just coming to say hi.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.187
I had texted you, but
i didn't hear back.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.822
- I tripped and
sprained my ankle.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.656
- Shoot, are you okay?

24:18.658 --> 24:20.825
- Yeah.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.725
I just have to ice.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.429
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:25.431 --> 24:28.299
So, the kas are
having a fundraiser

24:28.301 --> 24:29.834
after the game on Saturday,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.602
and I said that you would
stay and sign autographs.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.404
I think it would
really help my vote.

24:33.406 --> 24:34.638
- Okay.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.840
- Hey, do you think
if I win the crown

24:35.842 --> 24:37.208
your friend Ryan would
do a story on me?

24:37.210 --> 24:38.742
- I'll ask him.

24:38.744 --> 24:39.543
- Are you gonna be
able to play on Saturday?

24:39.545 --> 24:43.013
- Yes, of course.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.049
- Aw, come on, not again.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.350
- I can't help it.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.918
Told ya I was the champion.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.055
- Shh, I'm concentrating.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.790
- Don't mess up!

24:52.792 --> 24:53.724
- Agh!

24:53.726 --> 24:55.192
I'm gonna get you for that!

24:55.194 --> 24:57.228
- No!

24:57.230 --> 24:58.462
- Come here, come here!

24:58.464 --> 24:59.830
- No!

24:59.832 --> 25:00.865
- Better run!

25:01.667 --> 25:03.467
- No!

25:03.469 --> 25:05.703
No, no, no!

25:23.054 --> 25:24.889
- I gotta get home.

25:24.891 --> 25:25.723
Rematch?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.424
- You bet!

25:27.426 --> 25:28.292
- Bye, Emily!

25:28.294 --> 25:29.126
- Bye, Ian!

25:37.802 --> 25:39.737
- Who's hungry?

25:39.739 --> 25:40.905
- How was
youth group today?

25:40.907 --> 25:41.739
- Fine.

25:41.741 --> 25:42.673
- Just fine?

25:42.675 --> 25:43.941
- Yeah, it was fine.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.442
- Here we go.
- What do you want me to say?

25:45.444 --> 25:46.744
- I want you to talk to me,
Paula, and lose the attitude.

25:46.746 --> 25:47.745
- Here we go.
- Yes!

25:47.747 --> 25:49.380
- Look at
those guys, huh?

25:49.382 --> 25:50.314
- I'm home.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.483
- Hey, just in time.

25:52.485 --> 25:53.317
- Tacos.

25:53.319 --> 25:54.585
- All right.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.387
Hey, sweetheart, would
you say grace for us?

25:56.389 --> 25:59.990
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.225
- Dear lord, we thank you

26:01.227 --> 26:02.026
for this bounty
you have provided

26:02.028 --> 26:03.494
for us.
- Ow!

26:03.496 --> 26:05.362
- Please bless the
hands that prepared this food.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.764
In your name we're praying.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.598
Amen.
- Amen.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.501
- Amen.
- Amen.

26:10.503 --> 26:11.335
- All righty.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.505
One, yes sir.

26:14.507 --> 26:15.506
All right.

26:15.508 --> 26:16.840
- So how was your play date?

26:16.842 --> 26:18.142
- It was fun.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.109
We played croquet.

26:19.111 --> 26:19.944
- Nice.

26:19.946 --> 26:20.778
Who won?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.112
- Emily did.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.213
- Emily turd-is?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.815
- It's Curtis.

26:24.817 --> 26:25.749
- She's a weirdo.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.451
- No, she's not.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.686
- She's a total freak.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.220
- Hey, hey, Paula.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.023
We don't call people names
in this house, all right?

26:33.025 --> 26:34.258
- Well, she is.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.726
You shouldn't be
friends with her.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.495
- It is perfectly okay for
boys to be friends with girls.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.463
- Yeah.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.397
- No, it's not.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.333
Reverend Rachel says it's a sin.

26:42.335 --> 26:44.101
- That's not what she meant.

26:44.103 --> 26:48.005
- Then what
does she mean, dad?

26:48.007 --> 26:50.674
- You know how during
the breeding, the periods,

26:50.676 --> 26:54.078
breeding periods when a couple
agrees on having a child,

26:54.080 --> 26:56.547
they, well, in order to have
the kid they go through--

26:56.549 --> 26:58.682
- they're talking about
boys who do it with girls.

26:58.684 --> 27:01.118
- A woman and a man.
- Ew, gross.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.052
- Yeah, well, you know what?

27:02.054 --> 27:02.987
That's the right idea, son.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.188
We don't wanna see you end up

27:04.190 --> 27:07.191
like those kids from
the university--
- Peter.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.093
- What kids?

27:09.095 --> 27:09.927
- Never mind.

27:09.929 --> 27:10.894
That's enough chatter.

27:10.896 --> 27:11.829
- Oh, you know what?

27:11.831 --> 27:12.863
I totally forgot the cilantro.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.298
- Pass me the remote please.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.833
The game's on.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.834
- Be right back.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.987
- The reporter's
got game.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.889
- Look who it is,
the star quarterback.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.124
What are you doing here?

27:45.264 --> 27:46.497
- Oh my gosh.

27:48.801 --> 27:49.733
- Wow.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.069
Hey, I didn't know you play.

27:52.071 --> 27:52.903
- Think fast.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.647
- Oh, so she plays
football and basketball.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.816
- That's right.

28:05.818 --> 28:10.154
Wanna play?

28:10.156 --> 28:11.555
- Nah, I don't think so.

28:11.557 --> 28:12.489
- Come on.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.424
- You're too good.

28:13.426 --> 28:15.626
- Oh, but--
- psych!

28:17.129 --> 28:17.961
- Give up!

28:20.499 --> 28:22.533
- It's gonna be like that?

28:22.535 --> 28:25.302
- Yeah, it is.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.541
- Let's go.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.142
- All right, ready?

28:32.144 --> 28:32.976
- Come on.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.651
- You gonna go for it or what?

28:40.653 --> 28:41.485
Go for it.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.874
- Oh!

29:03.876 --> 29:05.476
What?

29:05.478 --> 29:09.747
- I don't know.
- Two out of two?

29:09.749 --> 29:12.616
Rematch?

29:12.618 --> 29:15.018
- Maybe.

29:17.723 --> 29:18.555
- Let's go.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.291
- Hell yeah.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.627
- Hey, Jude.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.895
- Good game, man.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.830
Seriously, good game.

29:26.832 --> 29:27.731
What's up, guys?

29:27.733 --> 29:29.967
- Yeah, you too.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.235
- Jude.
- How you doing?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.069
- Doing good.

29:32.071 --> 29:32.903
- Good, see ya.

29:32.905 --> 29:33.804
- Good.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.372
- Look who it is.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.474
- It's my favorite pledge.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.109
Looking good out there, Ryan.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.245
- Thank you.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.347
- Wanna play?

29:43.349 --> 29:49.119
- Yeah.

29:49.121 --> 29:53.624
- Sure.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.793
- Good morning, my
brothers and sisters.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.362
I want to welcome you
all to the house of god.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.899
And everyone is
welcome, even sinners.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.334
But today let's get real.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.937
I am saddened to
the core of my soul,

30:06.939 --> 30:08.806
as I believe that
you are as well.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.374
- Where
are you taking me?

30:10.376 --> 30:11.875
- You'll see.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.744
- Because
a sinner who is not saved

30:13.746 --> 30:15.245
cannot reform,

30:15.247 --> 30:18.615
and they will sadly
suffer the consequences

30:18.617 --> 30:20.317
of the wrath of god.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.319
- I love this.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.354
Where'd you find this place?

30:24.356 --> 30:27.090
- The frat guys come
up here sometimes,

30:27.092 --> 30:29.359
but I've always thought
it's just really pretty, so.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.828
- This is awesome.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.496
I haven't been on one of these
things since I was a kid.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.330
- Cool, right?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.531
- Yeah.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.100
You know how to
turn this thing on?

30:37.102 --> 30:38.302
- Maybe.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.436
I think it's just
missing a couple parts,

30:39.438 --> 30:42.039
but nothing I can't fix.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.513
Hey, think fast!

30:49.515 --> 30:51.949
- We are living in a very
rapidly changing time,

30:51.951 --> 30:55.519
a time that promotes
things like equality.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.920
They teach our innocent children

30:56.922 --> 30:59.857
that they can love
whomever they want to love,

30:59.859 --> 31:01.959
even someone of
the opposite sex.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.794
Can I get an amen on that?

31:03.796 --> 31:05.028
- Amen.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.464
- These values break
the moral compass

31:07.466 --> 31:09.967
that our children
were born with.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.401
This is their birthright.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.636
- Amen.

31:12.638 --> 31:15.272
- And I would like
to clarify something.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.408
Our god that tells us,
"thou shalt not kill,"

31:18.410 --> 31:20.978
is the same god that says,

31:20.980 --> 31:24.715
"mankind shall not
lie with womankind."

31:24.717 --> 31:28.051
You don't get to just
pick what you please.

31:28.053 --> 31:31.021
It's all or nothing
with the lord.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.157
So really, if you say
it's okay to be gay,

31:34.159 --> 31:36.727
you're saying it's okay to kill.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.229
Do you think god
wants us to kill?

31:39.231 --> 31:40.931
Of course not.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.933
That is how I see it.

31:42.935 --> 31:45.135
And that is how it
is reflected to us

31:45.137 --> 31:48.372
in the words of our holy Bible.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.040
- Amen.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.675
- And for that, we praise god.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.743
- Amen.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.011
- I'd like you all to stand

31:54.013 --> 31:56.013
and let's raise our
voices in praise.

31:56.015 --> 31:59.716
You know, some years ago,
they hid behind closed doors,

31:59.718 --> 32:03.120
as they should have,

32:03.122 --> 32:05.622
as they should still,

32:05.624 --> 32:11.194
but now it's okay to let
them do it openly, brazenly,

32:11.196 --> 32:15.732
at their public parades,
and even in our streets.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.868
Now they mock us.

32:17.870 --> 32:21.238
They live in sin, and
they live very openly.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.739
They live brazenly.

32:22.741 --> 32:28.245
They live without remorse.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.446
You see this.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.882
They're out there
marching for equality.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.483
Do you think that's right?

32:33.485 --> 32:36.486
I don't think so.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.522
Can you just imagine,
try to put your mind,

32:38.524 --> 32:40.457
if we were living in
a time when murderers

32:40.459 --> 32:43.226
demanded they be given
protection and civil rights

32:43.228 --> 32:48.031
instead of punishment
for their crimes.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.302
Why, you would just gasp
in amazement, wouldn't you?

32:52.304 --> 32:55.706
Yet, you embrace the notion

32:55.708 --> 32:57.941
that because someone
engages in sex

32:57.943 --> 32:59.643
with a person of
the opposite gender

32:59.645 --> 33:01.745
that they deserve the
same human rights?

33:01.747 --> 33:05.282
I don't think so.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.985
That's not god's intention.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.958
Because the truth is clear.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.294
Men and women are
equal in god's eyes,

33:17.296 --> 33:20.831
but should live separately
in same-sex unions,

33:20.833 --> 33:22.099
where the most sacred

33:22.101 --> 33:25.802
of brotherly and
sisterly love can bloom,

33:25.804 --> 33:28.839
as is his design.

33:28.841 --> 33:32.275
They will work together
in humble donation

33:32.277 --> 33:33.877
during the breeding season,

33:33.879 --> 33:36.513
so new sons and daughters
can be brought forth

33:36.515 --> 33:42.619
to carry god's holy and very
beautiful and blessed message.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.088
We shall not subject ourselves

33:45.090 --> 33:48.458
to the breeding
tendencies of animals

33:48.460 --> 33:51.895
who show no restraint.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.398
I know that many of you are
troubled by these events

33:54.400 --> 33:57.167
that we have been going
through as a community,

33:57.169 --> 33:59.202
as am I.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.407
We are going to pray for
these sinners, right?

34:03.409 --> 34:04.341
That's what we're gonna do,

34:04.343 --> 34:05.442
because we believe in god.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.485
- Forgive me reverend,
for I have sinned.

34:15.487 --> 34:20.290
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.625
- God blesses you on this day,

34:21.627 --> 34:24.127
and forgives those that
ask his forgiveness.

34:24.129 --> 34:27.431
Proceed, my child.

34:33.772 --> 34:34.603
- I'll get you!

34:36.641 --> 34:38.041
- Stop it!

34:46.050 --> 34:49.319
- I've been having
impure thoughts.

34:49.321 --> 34:54.658
I can't make the
thoughts go away.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.327
I don't know if I want to.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.697
- Giving in to your physical
desires is a selfish act,

35:00.699 --> 35:03.667
and to act on that
lust is sinful.

35:15.079 --> 35:21.451
- Yes, reverend.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.655
- Does anyone know what
this word means, hetero?

35:25.657 --> 35:26.923
Yes, Jodie?

35:26.925 --> 35:28.291
- Hetero is short
for heterosexual.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.326
Means when a person is attracted

35:29.328 --> 35:31.027
to people of the opposite sex.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.529
- Yes.

35:32.531 --> 35:36.199
Does anyone in this class
know any heterosexuals?

35:36.201 --> 35:37.400
No?

35:37.402 --> 35:41.238
Well, what if I told
you there is one

35:41.240 --> 35:44.808
right here in this classroom?

35:44.810 --> 35:50.847
Right here with us today,

35:50.849 --> 35:53.650
and here he is.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.819
Would you believe the world's
most famous playwright,

35:55.821 --> 35:57.220
William Shakespeare,

35:57.222 --> 35:59.990
was actually a heterosexual?

35:59.992 --> 36:03.493
And he wrote his most famous
play, Romeo and Julio,

36:03.495 --> 36:07.330
for his secret lover, the
duchess of southampton.

36:07.332 --> 36:13.370
This is a copy of
Romeo and Juliet.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.107
- Yes?

36:17.109 --> 36:18.608
- What does that
mean, Mr. Thompson?

36:18.610 --> 36:22.245
- Well, that means Julio
will be played by a girl.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.482
I know, I know,
it's a big change,

36:25.484 --> 36:29.386
but it is our job as artists
to not only entertain,

36:29.388 --> 36:31.655
but to also enlighten.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.791
Now I hope the girls here
will jump at the opportunity

36:34.793 --> 36:37.427
to play one of the juiciest
roles ever written--

36:37.429 --> 36:38.995
- oh my god, that's so exciting!

36:38.997 --> 36:40.797
- Okay, now, auditions
are next week.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.999
Everyone must prepare something.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.907
- I'm so excited, aren't you?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.309
- I guess so.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.377
- You'd make a great Romeo.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.612
- You think so?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.147
- Yeah, and maybe
if I got Juliet,

36:57.149 --> 36:59.316
we could practice
our lines together?

36:59.318 --> 37:00.483
- That'd be really cool.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.418
- Seriously?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.252
Ew.

37:02.254 --> 37:05.155
Romeo and Juliet?

37:05.157 --> 37:07.123
That's so queer.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.059
What are you Emily,
some kind of 'ro?

37:09.061 --> 37:10.260
- What, no.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.561
- Why don't you go ahead
and kiss him, Emily?

37:11.563 --> 37:12.596
- Stop.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.997
- Kiss him, kiss him!

37:13.999 --> 37:15.498
- 'Ro, 'ro!

37:15.500 --> 37:19.236
- 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,

37:19.238 --> 37:23.206
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,

37:23.208 --> 37:26.977
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro!

37:26.979 --> 37:32.482
- Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on here?

37:32.484 --> 37:34.017
What's happening here, Emily?

37:34.019 --> 37:34.851
I'm talking to you.

37:34.853 --> 37:35.685
Who started this?

37:35.687 --> 37:36.519
- Nobody.

37:36.521 --> 37:37.354
- Nobody?

37:37.356 --> 37:40.457
And you, what about you?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.392
Where are you supposed to be?

37:42.394 --> 37:43.693
- Language.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.527
- Then get to it.

37:44.529 --> 37:45.729
Let's go.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.863
How about you, where
are you supposed to be?

37:46.865 --> 37:47.697
- Math.
- Well, get there.

37:47.699 --> 37:52.135
Come on.

38:03.748 --> 38:07.884
- 'Ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,

38:07.886 --> 38:10.053
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro!

38:28.039 --> 38:30.006
- Jeez.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.876
Oh, you scared me.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.845
What's going on?

38:35.847 --> 38:39.416
- What's going on?

38:39.418 --> 38:40.684
What's going on?

38:40.686 --> 38:47.457
I feel like I should be
the one asking you that.

38:47.459 --> 38:52.862
- I'm not a mind
reader, kel, come on.

38:52.864 --> 38:53.997
- You said you couldn't
hang out tonight

38:53.999 --> 38:59.736
because you had to study.

38:59.738 --> 39:05.008
- Okay, what is
this really about?

39:05.010 --> 39:05.942
- I don't know.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.311
I just, I miss you, you know?

39:08.313 --> 39:10.213
I feel like I never
get to see you anymore.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.349
- You're always doing
your sorority girl thing,

39:12.351 --> 39:16.553
and homecoming campaign.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.521
I'm sorry if I make
you feel neglected.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.757
I'm really not trying to.
- No, no.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.359
You don't make me
feel neglected.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.727
- Okay, good.

39:23.729 --> 39:27.630
- I just feel like...

39:27.632 --> 39:28.465
I don't know.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.633
I miss you.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.236
- Go ahead, answer it, okay?

39:33.238 --> 39:34.204
I know that you want to.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.105
- Stop it.
- It's fine.

39:35.107 --> 39:35.905
- Come here.
- Ugh!

39:35.907 --> 39:38.174
- Get up here.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.008
Hey.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.744
- Hi.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.947
- This is more important.

39:43.949 --> 39:44.948
- Oh, really?

39:44.950 --> 39:47.417
- Mm-hmm.

39:47.419 --> 39:48.485
- Prove it.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.269
- I love you so much.

40:06.271 --> 40:09.272
I promise I will not
stress you out so much

40:09.274 --> 40:10.974
with my craziness.

40:10.976 --> 40:11.808
- Me too.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.543
- Okay.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.377
- Okay.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.246
- Good.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.816
- Oh, shoot, that's me.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.351
Oh, I'm late for my ka meeting.

40:21.353 --> 40:22.285
I gotta go, okay?

40:22.287 --> 40:24.821
But I'll see you later, okay?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.623
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.457
Bye.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.576
- What?
- You trust me, right?

40:46.578 --> 40:47.477
Stand right here.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.745
- Where are we?

40:48.747 --> 40:50.280
- Keep your eyes closed.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.848
- Okay, they're closed.

40:51.850 --> 40:52.882
- I'm watching you.

40:59.324 --> 41:04.194
- Oh my god.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.037
Are you serious?

41:14.039 --> 41:14.938
- I'm pretty serious.

41:14.940 --> 41:15.905
- Oh my goodness.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.874
How did you do this?

41:17.876 --> 41:20.777
- I told you, i
can fix anything.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.651
- I like you.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.486
- What?

41:29.488 --> 41:30.320
What was that?

41:30.322 --> 41:35.658
- I like you.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.597
Oh my god, I'm on a carousel!

41:45.904 --> 41:48.037
- You are something else.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.306
- Do you think so?

41:50.308 --> 41:51.140
- Oh yeah.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.549
Well, my queen,

41:59.551 --> 42:03.419
your chariot awaits.

42:03.421 --> 42:06.456
Join me here, please.

42:06.458 --> 42:08.157
- You're too much.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.225
- Whoa, don't fall.

42:16.434 --> 42:17.867
- You good?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.904
- So good.

42:20.906 --> 42:21.738
- I'm glad.

43:06.383 --> 43:07.450
- What are we doing?

43:14.692 --> 43:16.059
- Falling in love.

44:26.730 --> 44:27.597
- Jude?

44:27.599 --> 44:28.431
- Hi.

44:28.433 --> 44:29.766
- Hey.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.100
It's nice to see you.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.035
Come on in.

44:32.037 --> 44:34.871
- Hey, I was just curious.

44:34.873 --> 44:38.341
What's the deal
with the alliance?

44:38.343 --> 44:39.609
- Oh.

44:39.611 --> 44:40.543
- I actually just
came by to say hi,

44:40.545 --> 44:42.845
but I don't have much time, so.

44:42.847 --> 44:45.081
- Well, we're a
national organization

44:45.083 --> 44:48.584
with over 200 memberships

44:48.586 --> 44:51.921
in universities, high
schools and junior highs,

44:51.923 --> 44:55.658
and our goal is to
encourage acceptance and--

44:55.660 --> 44:57.226
- did you
say junior highs?

44:57.228 --> 44:59.028
- Yeah.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.596
Kids that age, unfortunately,

45:00.598 --> 45:03.499
are really vulnerable to
bullying and peer pressure,

45:03.501 --> 45:08.071
and we think that an open
dialogue can save lives.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.505
- What do you mean save lives?

45:09.507 --> 45:12.408
- Heterosexuality is the
leading cause of teen suicide,

45:12.410 --> 45:13.976
and these kids need to know
that they're not alone,

45:13.978 --> 45:19.916
that there's a place for
them to come and talk,

45:19.918 --> 45:22.051
or anybody to come and talk.

45:27.024 --> 45:31.661
Is there something you
want to talk about?

45:31.663 --> 45:32.962
- No.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.466
- This place is
safe and confidential.

45:52.449 --> 45:58.121
- You know that guy
that I bumped into
when I first met you?

45:58.123 --> 45:59.722
- Oh, yeah.

45:59.724 --> 46:00.823
Ryan, right?

46:00.825 --> 46:07.497
- Mm-hmm.

46:07.499 --> 46:10.867
I don't know, at first,

46:10.869 --> 46:13.603
I just thought it was cool
to talk to him and stuff,

46:13.605 --> 46:16.172
and then we were
playing basketball

46:16.174 --> 46:22.044
and something happened
and it was like I woke up,

46:22.046 --> 46:25.381
and I don't know, it just,

46:25.383 --> 46:30.219
I wanted to push it away.

46:30.221 --> 46:31.420
I don't know, when
we touched again,

46:31.422 --> 46:34.190
it was like this
feeling came over me

46:34.192 --> 46:36.659
that I did not want to stop.

46:41.632 --> 46:47.503
I know that this is wrong, but

46:47.505 --> 46:51.741
I don't know, it
just feels so right.

46:51.743 --> 46:53.342
Know what I mean?

46:53.344 --> 46:54.877
- Absolutely.

46:54.879 --> 46:57.313
Some people are born
attracted to the same sex.

46:57.315 --> 47:00.750
Some people are born
attracted to the opposite sex.

47:00.752 --> 47:04.487
I prefer to think
of it as giving love

47:04.489 --> 47:06.689
and being loved in return,

47:06.691 --> 47:11.594
and the rest is just
plumbing.

47:11.596 --> 47:14.163
Does he feel the
same way about you?

47:14.165 --> 47:14.997
- Oh yeah.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.767
- Oh yeah?

47:17.769 --> 47:22.939
That makes things a lot easier.

47:22.941 --> 47:24.440
- Yeah.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.444
We've only kissed, but it
was like the best kiss.

47:28.446 --> 47:30.913
Oh my god, I can't stop
thinking about him.

47:30.915 --> 47:33.282
- That's wonderful,

47:33.284 --> 47:35.384
and it's not gonna
be an easy path.

47:35.386 --> 47:39.989
You're gonna have to tell
your friends and your family.

47:39.991 --> 47:41.791
- Wait, wait, no.

47:41.793 --> 47:45.328
I can't, I can't tell anybody.

47:45.330 --> 47:46.195
No, okay?

47:46.197 --> 47:47.530
I play football.

47:47.532 --> 47:52.635
And I'm not a poster
child for hetero rights.

47:52.637 --> 47:55.872
- Well, you're
falling for him, aren't you?

47:55.874 --> 48:01.077
- Yeah, well, football, i
love football way more, so.

48:01.079 --> 48:03.613
I gotta go, sorry.

48:03.615 --> 48:06.582
- You can have both.

48:06.584 --> 48:10.853
- "But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

48:10.855 --> 48:13.256
"It is the east, and
Juliet is the sun.

48:13.258 --> 48:17.193
"Arise, fair sun, and
kill the envious moon."

48:17.195 --> 48:19.362
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

48:19.364 --> 48:21.731
- What?

48:21.733 --> 48:22.965
Hey!

48:22.967 --> 48:24.667
- Are you trying out for
that stupid gay play?

48:24.669 --> 48:25.501
Hmm?

48:25.503 --> 48:26.435
Huh?

48:26.437 --> 48:27.937
You're not doing that play.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.105
And you're never talking to that

48:29.107 --> 48:31.841
ugly 'ro Emily
turd-is ever again.

48:31.843 --> 48:33.242
- You can't tell me what to do!

48:33.244 --> 48:34.877
- Yes I can!

48:34.879 --> 48:36.412
Bad enough you're a geek face.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.515
But if you turn out to
be a 'ro on top of that,

48:39.517 --> 48:41.217
I'll make you wish
you were never born.

48:47.191 --> 48:48.024
- Loser.

48:51.763 --> 48:55.064
- "Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?

48:55.066 --> 49:00.836
"Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

49:00.838 --> 49:03.539
"Or if that--"

49:16.386 --> 49:18.387
"wherefore art thou Romeo?

49:18.389 --> 49:20.890
"Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

49:20.892 --> 49:21.724
"Or if that--"

49:36.873 --> 49:40.476
"or if that will not
be but sworn, my love,

49:40.478 --> 49:42.244
"i will no longer be

49:42.246 --> 49:44.113
"a capulet."

50:02.366 --> 50:03.766
Leave me alone.

50:21.218 --> 50:22.118
- Good night, girls.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.152
Don't forget to vote.

50:42.172 --> 50:43.739
- Hello?

50:52.282 --> 50:53.849
Hello?

51:16.807 --> 51:18.274
- Might need these.

51:20.344 --> 51:22.078
- How'd you get those?

51:22.080 --> 51:24.780
- I have my ways.

51:34.791 --> 51:39.028
After you.

51:49.072 --> 51:49.939
- It's so quiet.

51:56.147 --> 51:57.046
The water's perfect.

52:32.616 --> 52:33.482
- Oh yeah.

54:20.323 --> 54:23.359
Wanna race?

54:23.361 --> 54:24.193
- No.

54:47.083 --> 54:50.452
I'm scared.

54:50.454 --> 54:53.155
- Me too.

54:57.560 --> 55:01.130
- Do you really love me?

55:01.132 --> 55:04.500
- Absolutely.

55:04.502 --> 55:05.367
With all my heart.

56:46.536 --> 56:47.803
- Hey, Jude.

56:47.805 --> 56:52.808
You mind if I take
a seat with you?

56:52.810 --> 56:55.711
I like it when it's
quiet here too.

56:55.713 --> 56:57.246
- Yeah.

57:03.353 --> 57:04.386
- How you doing, Jude?

57:04.388 --> 57:05.320
You seem happy.

57:05.322 --> 57:08.257
Things are going well for you.

57:08.259 --> 57:13.095
- Yeah, yeah.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.731
The team's on a roll,
and the scouts are out.

57:15.733 --> 57:16.999
Everything's great.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.444
- Now how about you and
Kelly, how are you doing?

57:33.616 --> 57:36.518
- Can I be honest
with you, reverend?

57:47.497 --> 57:48.630
I think that I'm in
love with the person

57:48.632 --> 57:51.166
that god wants me to be with,

57:56.139 --> 58:02.211
and our love, it's so easy.

58:02.213 --> 58:04.813
It's like we just fit together.

58:04.815 --> 58:09.318
You know what I mean?

58:09.320 --> 58:13.288
- You're not
talking about Kelly.

58:13.290 --> 58:16.358
Right?

58:16.360 --> 58:17.993
That's not right, Jude.

58:17.995 --> 58:18.794
- I know, I tried, i--

58:18.796 --> 58:20.963
- listen to me, Jude.

58:20.965 --> 58:24.366
You cannot lead a
person on like that.

58:24.368 --> 58:27.503
You need to go and let her know,

58:27.505 --> 58:29.371
and then you bring your
new girlfriend here.

58:29.373 --> 58:32.274
Together we're going to pray
together for forgiveness

58:32.276 --> 58:35.043
because deceit is a sin.

58:35.045 --> 58:37.479
Let's pray on that
together a minute.

58:37.481 --> 58:39.948
Our father, who are in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

58:39.950 --> 58:41.617
Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done on earth

58:41.619 --> 58:43.685
as it is in heaven.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.254
Give us this day our daily bread

58:45.256 --> 58:46.622
and forgive us our trespasses,

58:46.624 --> 58:49.091
as we forgive those who...

58:49.093 --> 58:52.961
- Five, four,
three, two, one!

58:52.963 --> 58:53.795
- Time!

58:53.797 --> 58:54.630
Come on out, boys.

58:54.632 --> 58:56.532
- Oh!

58:56.534 --> 58:57.366
- Welcome back.

58:57.368 --> 58:59.368
Welcome back!

58:59.370 --> 59:00.602
Yes!

59:00.604 --> 59:01.870
All right!

59:01.872 --> 59:05.641
Who is next?

59:05.643 --> 59:09.611
Let's see.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.647
You, Walter.

59:11.649 --> 59:12.548
- All right.

59:12.550 --> 59:13.582
- Oh!
- You're up.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.449
Big Walt!

59:22.725 --> 59:25.694
- Oh!

59:25.696 --> 59:27.563
- Lucky boy!

59:27.565 --> 59:29.898
Gets to spend seven
minutes with Ryan.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.199
All right, it's your choice,
seven minutes in heaven

59:31.201 --> 59:32.634
or seven minutes in hell.

59:32.636 --> 59:34.002
- You know he
wants you to choose hell.

59:34.004 --> 59:35.170
- Get off of me!

59:35.172 --> 59:36.605
- Hey, hey, hey.

59:36.607 --> 59:37.906
Ryan?

59:37.908 --> 59:41.443
It's just a game.

59:41.445 --> 59:45.013
- I guess it's
time for hell then.

59:45.950 --> 59:48.283
- No, just back off, all right?

59:48.285 --> 59:53.021
- Hey, why you acting like
such a candy-ass 'ro, huh?

59:53.023 --> 59:55.390
Oh, wait.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.225
Unless you are a 'ro.

59:58.529 --> 01:00:01.263
- Oh!

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:02.764
- I'm not a 'ro.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:07.169
- 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro!

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:11.673
- Hey!

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:15.243
Then prove it.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:17.546
- I don't have to
prove anything.

01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:21.817
- Yes, you do.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.352
- Oh, come on, look,

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:25.887
Walter's got this gorgeous
fat face waiting for you.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:26.955
Oh, the cushion for the pushing.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.790
- He's just a fat little piggy.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:29.725
He's just a fat little piggy.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.093
Oink for us, boy.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.661
Hey, I said oink!

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.929
- Oink.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.130
Oink.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.031
- Jesus, he smells
like one, too.

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:36.865
- Come on.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:38.233
- Ryan--
- move.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.201
- Hey!

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.469
Hey, you walk outta here,

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:43.405
and you can kiss this
fraternity goodbye.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.173
- Fine with me.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:48.610
- Ryan.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:51.480
Don't do this, okay?

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.383
- Are you coming?

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:56.218
- I can't.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.420
I need this.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:00.055
- You do not need this.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:05.661
You are being degraded.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.696
- This is all I got.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:15.604
- Come on, Ryan.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:17.539
Stop, man.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.907
- Let him go, let him go.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.375
Good choice, Walter.

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:23.278
Walter, Walter, Walter, step
right up, step right up.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.848
50 bucks to whoever
is man enough

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.152
to go into the closet
with the piggy.

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.754
How about you?

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:34.790
- Who wants cornbread?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.692
Who wants some cornbread?

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:37.526
I bet you do.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.794
Did you wash your hands?

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:39.628
- I don't know.

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:42.464
- Good answer?

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.700
Emily, did you tell your mom

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.401
you're trying out
for the school play?

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.803
- The school play?

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:51.206
What happened to
the football team?

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.507
- I got cut.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:56.578
- After I paid
for all that coaching?

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.612
- I'm sorry, mom.

01:01:57.614 --> 01:02:03.318
I'm not that coordinated.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.854
- So, what's the play?

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:08.090
- Romeo and Juliet.

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:09.624
I'm trying out for Juliet.

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.993
- Well, that's
wonderful, isn't it?

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:13.228
- That's terrific.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.597
- Mr. Thompson
rewrote it for girls.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.299
Did you know that Shakespeare
wrote it for his secret lover,

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.068
the duchess of southampton?

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.807
- Wait.

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:29.911
Wait, what role did you say
you were trying out for?

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.880
- Juliet.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:34.382
- And who's playing Romeo?

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:38.220
- Hopefully Ian santilli.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.322
- But he's a boy, honey.

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:42.457
I thought you said it was
being rewritten for girls.

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:46.194
- Only Julio's part.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.463
Mr. Thompson says we're
gonna enlighten the school

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:51.199
about tolerance.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:55.036
- Did you know about this?

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:58.974
- Well, I did sign a consent
for her rehearsals, but--

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:01.143
- bad enough these heteros are
moving into our neighborhood.

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:02.878
Now they want their
perverted lifestyles

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.845
taught in our schools?

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:04.880
No, no way.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:06.148
You're not doing the play.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.750
You are not doing
this kind of crap.

01:03:08.752 --> 01:03:09.584
Gimme that.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:10.418
I'm not having this.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.253
No ma'am.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.087
This is garbage.

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:13.288
Hetero crap.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.489
Who does this Mr.
Thompson think he is,

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.758
putting our kids in
these adult situations?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.959
If he's not careful,

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.628
he's gonna end up
with another situation

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.263
just like the one
at the university.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:23.331
What's the name
of the principal?

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:27.068
- Henry birdsell, but I'm
gonna call him tomorrow.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.003
- Yes,
can I get a number

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.638
for a Henry birdsell please?

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.840
- Honey, i
will call him tomorrow.

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.074
Go wash your hands.

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:38.146
- Thank you.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.714
You know I'm right about this.

01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:42.717
I don't like the
look of her results.

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:43.552
No.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.506
- Thanks.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.275
Jude.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.443
Hey, come here.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.312
- Hey.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.146
- Hey.

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:12.247
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.683
I was talking to
reverend Rachel.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.951
- That's okay.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:17.485
I'm used to being
last on your list.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.687
- Kelly, stop it.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:19.621
- No, no, it's
fine, that's okay.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.456
I know you have a lot going on.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:26.228
Here, take a button.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.163
- Can we talk?

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.731
- Did you know that
your friend Ryan

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:33.468
was kicked out of
his fraternity?

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.170
- What?

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:36.238
Why?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.439
- Yeah.

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:38.640
Here you go, thanks.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:42.577
They think he's a closet hetero.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.846
- Really?

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:46.481
- Isn't that funny?

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:47.949
- Wow.
- Here you go.

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:49.484
Vote for Kelly.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:56.291
- That's really surprising.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.159
- Did he ever try
anything with you?

01:04:58.161 --> 01:04:59.861
- No.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:02.297
No, that's disgusting.

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.865
- Right, okay.

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.200
Here, take a sucker.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:10.005
Vote Kelly.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:13.541
- Hey, Kelly, I need
to be honest with you.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.782
Kel,

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:23.685
Kelly,

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:27.789
reverend Rachel thinks
that we should end this.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:38.033
- So you told her
what's going on?

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.235
- Yeah.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:44.239
- And her answer was for
you to break up with me?

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:46.942
- Yeah.

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:51.646
- And you chose to do
it here, in public?

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.481
- Yeah.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:54.516
I'm sorry.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.451
I don't know how to do this.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:06:01.056
I don't know.
I just know that it's not
right for me to lead you on.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.634
- The vote is tomorrow,

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.370
and we need to keep this
between us until then, okay?

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:19.274
Because I need to figure out
how to go public with it.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:20.108
- Go public with it?

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.576
What are you talking--

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:23.144
- yes, Jude, we are a
celebrity couple on campus

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.980
and things need to be
handled a certain way.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.082
Here, take a button, thanks.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.651
- Kelly.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:30.585
I'm sorry I...

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:34.255
- You owe me this.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.191
Okay?

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.225
Here you go.

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.160
Vote for Kelly.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.364
Do you want a picture
with Jude klein?

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:43.298
Smile.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.100
I need votes.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:48.003
Here, put this on.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:50.138
- I tried to cleanse that
sinner, I really did,

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.272
but it didn't help.

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:54.042
I still felt the
same way inside.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:55.276
So I asked the lord for a sign.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:56.244
- And when
you prayed about this,

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.912
what did the lord say?

01:06:57.914 --> 01:07:00.515
- Revelations 16.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.349
And then I knew it was done.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.851
Thank you, god.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.486
He said that if I cleansed
sin wherever I found it,

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:09.057
then I'd also cleanse myself.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.925
- God came down with
his divine spirit.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:12.060
And you know what he did?

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.461
We got a second chance.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:14.963
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:17.866
He stopped the defilement
of our humble community.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:21.803
And we should
thank god for that.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:23.038
- If I'm doing god's work,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.206
then why do I feel
like such a sinner?

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.643
- These boys believed
that what they were doing

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:33.348
was acting on behalf of
the holy spirit to save us.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.484
So who are we to judge them?

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.253
- God bless all sinners.
- God bless all sinners.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:40.755
And may they walk on the path
of the lord and do your work.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:44.492
- May they walk on the path
of the lord and do his work.

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:49.497
- We are going to pray
for these sinners.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:52.367
Each of us is gonna continue
to spread the holy word,

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:55.904
because these messages
were sent by god.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:57.405
Ah, reverend Duncan.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:00.942
- And in doing so, this is
going to save all of us.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:01.876
- I'm detective Michaels.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:02.811
- Yes?

01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:04.412
- My partner, detective Emerson.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.581
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your involvement

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.016
in the persecution
and attempted murder

01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:11.052
of a young heterosexual.

01:08:16.827 --> 01:08:19.359
- Stay away from my brother,
turd-is, you weirdo!

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.194
What is wrong

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:21.029
with you, anyway?

01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:21.863
You're a sinner.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:22.697
You need to cleanse!

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:27.836
What's wrong with you?

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:28.670
Stay down!

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:29.671
- Help!

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:32.273
- What's wrong with you?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.408
Stay down!
- Stop, stop!

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:36.511
- Take a drink,
cleanse yourself!

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:37.444
Stay down!

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.881
Come on, let's go!

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.383
- What is happening?
- Freak!

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:46.154
Come on, let's go, come on.
- Hey!

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:47.755
- Jesus.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.424
Sweetheart, stand up.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:56.430
You okay?

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:58.133
Why don't you dry yourself?

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:05.140
I'll make sure those girls get
punished severely for this.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:06.640
Look, I know this is
a tough time for you,

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.544
but I promise you, you're
gonna get through this.

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.045
You hear me?

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:15.550
Emily, you know the only
reason those girls do this

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:20.622
is because they're
jealous of you, right?

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.624
- Jealous of me?

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:28.897
- That's right, because
you know who you are.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.465
Most people don't
start figuring that out

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:37.438
until they're old like me.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.439
Now, let's get you
another script,

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:42.042
because I expect to see
you at that audition,

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:44.011
you understand me?

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:47.649
- Yes, sir.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:48.850
- I pray to god for forgiveness.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.752
I pray to god for these sinners.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.921
- Hey.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:54.455
Take a look at that.

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.438
So, one of the boys
involved in the incident

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.041
claims to have had a phone
conversation with you

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:16.611
where you ordered them
to do the victim harm.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:17.946
Do you know anything about that?

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:19.180
- I'm a woman of faith.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:21.149
I don't believe
in giving orders.

01:10:21.151 --> 01:10:22.784
- All right.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.219
I'll rephrase.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:28.423
Where you advised
them to do god's work.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.357
How about that?

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.592
- I have many parishioners.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:31.960
I speak to them
on a daily basis.

01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:33.828
I couldn't possibly remember

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.331
every conversation
I've ever had.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.700
- Of course not, of course.

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:40.501
Let me ask you a question.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.736
You ever watch YouTube?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.004
- I don't have time
for that kind of thing.

01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:45.340
I'm busy doing the lord's work.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:46.608
- Of course you are.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.610
Well, one of the things
about this generation

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.045
is that they love to document
every aspect of their lives

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.280
on the Internet.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.582
Now, most of the
time it's inane,

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.719
but every now and then we find
something of real interest.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:11:00.755
Emerson, lights please.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.190
- Oh, wait.

01:11:02.192 --> 01:11:03.291
I'm gonna call the reverend.

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:06.661
She'll know what to do.

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.134
- Hey.

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:14.836
- Hey Jude, it's Susan.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.070
- What's going on?

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.605
- Oh, nothing, I just
talked to Collin Reese,

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.707
and he's coming to
the game tomorrow.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:20.808
- Are you serious?

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:21.576
- Yes, and
wait, it gets better.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:22.377
- Oh my god!

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:23.311
Are you kidding me?

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:24.579
That's the greatest news!

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:25.813
Greatest day ever!
- He wants to know

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:26.781
if you're available for
dinner tomorrow night

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:27.615
after the game.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.618
- Oh I do, I do.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.821
- Jude?

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:34.789
- Oh my god, oh my god.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.791
- Jude?

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:37.625
Hello?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.093
Hello, hello, hello?

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:39.927
Jude?

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.571
- Oh my god oh my god!

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.449
Hey guys.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.450
What's going on?

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:06.748
Kelly!

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.759
- I told you we
were going public.

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:18.593
- How could you do this to me?

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:21.229
- I didn't do this!

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:23.131
You did it!

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:24.632
And this, and this!

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:27.468
- Kelly, Kelly, please stop!
- And this and this and this!

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:28.302
- Stop it, stop it!

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:29.370
- Why?

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:31.973
- Listen to me, stop, stop.
- Why?

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:33.941
What, so you can lie
to my face again?

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:34.976
- Please, please, stop--
- don't touch me!

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:35.810
Stop!

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:48.623
Tell your little boyfriend
that everybody knows.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:49.957
Oh, and have a
good game tomorrow.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.509
- Susan?

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:10.511
Are you still there?

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:11.345
Hello?

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.283
- This
is Ryan, leave a message.

01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:16.918
- Ryan, please pick up.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.453
Ryan, Kelly knows.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:22.423
Ryan, everybody
knows everything.

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:23.791
Kelly knows.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.259
She put pictures
of us everywhere.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.895
If you love me, Ryan, you've
got to go somewhere safe, okay?

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.998
Just please go somewhere safe.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.133
I love you.

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:49.684
- Yes Mrs.
fallon, how are you?

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:51.118
And we've been,

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.988
and we feel the
same way, yes we do.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.590
I understand, I understand.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.024
I appreciate the call.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:15:00.094
Yes, we're on top of
it, I promise you.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:04.265
Have a good day.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:08.102
Dave?
- Yes.

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:10.438
- David, how
long have you been

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.209
teaching drama for us?

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.145
- I believe five years.

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:22.316
This is the sixth year.

01:15:22.318 --> 01:15:23.584
- And how many times

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:26.153
have you ever changed
a piece of literature

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:31.292
to use as a teaching
opportunity?

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.160
- Well, Henry, I would say that

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:34.929
I see every piece of
literature as a teaching--

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:37.131
- no, come on, you
know what I mean.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:39.033
- How many times have i
actually changed the text?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.501
No, this is the first.

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:42.103
- Why?

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:43.371
Why would you do that now?

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:44.605
Hmm?

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:47.174
Especially with this
topic, in particular?

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.209
- Well, first of
all because

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.877
it's a really cool idea.

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:52.413
Artistically it has merit.

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:54.181
But more importantly,

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:59.453
because what happened to
Ryan Morris was horrendous.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:01.255
- It was horrendous, exactly,

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:02.189
which is why we shouldn't be

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:06.193
reminding the children about it.

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:08.496
- Children aren't born with
that kind of hatred, Henry.

01:16:08.498 --> 01:16:09.697
They learn it.

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:12.333
And it's our job as
educators to make sure--

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:15.937
- Nate, hold my calls please.

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:17.872
- I believe it is
our job as educators

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:20.474
to make sure these kids see
the world in the right way,

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:21.976
not just intellectually,
but morally.

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:23.878
- That's where i
disagree with you.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.315
Moral issues are to
be handled at home.

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:30.718
- This is happening on
our time, in our space.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.919
What are we supposed to do?

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.154
- It's not our job.
- Are we supposed to...

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.422
This is happening
under our roof.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:35.690
- Moral issues are to be
handled by the parents.

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:36.624
It's their
responsibility, not ours.

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:37.892
- So what are we supposed to do?

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:39.560
We're supposed to just
stand back and watch--

01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:41.095
- there's always going
to be bullying, David.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:44.265
- I don't think anyone deserves
to be beaten or bullied

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:46.367
or talked down to because of--

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:48.569
- why are you being
so pro-heterosexual?

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:50.204
- Well, I'm not being.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:53.507
- David, my phone
has been ringing off
the hook all morning.

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:54.742
- I predicted that.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:55.610
I probably should have
talked to you first.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:56.544
I apologize.

01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:58.012
- These parents want blood.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.615
- Okay.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:01.782
- They want blood, David.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:02.984
- Well.

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:05.052
- And, sorry to say--

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.054
- it's not that
big of deal, okay?

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:11.559
- You can resign today
for personal reasons or--

01:17:11.561 --> 01:17:12.793
- what?

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.128
Come on.
- Or, or--

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.730
- Henry, stop it.
- Or the superintendent

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:16.964
said we can fire you--

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.232
- the superintendent?

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:19.433
- Reverend Rachel
made it very clear

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:22.903
that if you weren't
gone by lunchtime today,

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:25.139
there would be hell to pay
for him come election time.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.641
- She's a reverend.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:27.875
She can't do that.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:34.649
- Mm-hmm, yeah, she
can, and she will.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:39.654
So, David, it's killing
me, it breaks my heart.

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:42.289
What's it gonna be?

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.992
Resignation or termination?

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:53.334
- I'm hungry.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:58.639
What's for lunch?

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:00.775
- These are from
yesterday's jubilee.

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:02.710
- Waste not, want not, dear.

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:03.911
- Holy shit!

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.846
- Benson, how many
times have I told you

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.249
to watch your garbage
mouth in my house?

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:10.151
- I'm sorry, aunt Rachel,
but you gotta hear this.

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:11.419
Star quarterback outed.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:12.753
- Who?

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:16.157
- Jude klein.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.658
- Jude klein?

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.926
- It says that her
girlfriend Kelly Williams

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:20.528
outed her yesterday
after she caught her

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.864
in the act with some
guy named Ryan Morris.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.533
- That little bitch.

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:27.001
- Oh, listen to
this, listen to this.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:28.969
When asked why she posted
her pictures all over campus,

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.773
Williams replied, "according
to my mentor, reverend Rachel,

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.508
"it is my religious
duty to expose sin

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.177
"wherever I can find it."

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:39.180
Head coach Glen Thompson said
that she's still gonna go pro,

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:40.648
that they have scouts

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:41.882
from the packers, the
steelers and the patriots

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.350
all confirmed for
tonight's game.

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:46.053
- Oh, that's not gonna happen.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.588
I told her it was okay.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.291
I told her that god was gonna
pick out someone just for her.

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:51.525
- What are you talking about?

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:52.827
- You know, I might
have been fooled,

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:54.361
but the good lord is not fooled.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:55.796
No, he is not.

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:59.800
He sees truth where truth
exists and he acts accordingly.

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:02.703
- That's the truth.

01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:04.505
- Praise god, help me.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:06.307
It's time to do god's work.

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:12.213
Benson, I need to
focus on family values
at the photo shoot.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.714
You're gonna go to
that football game,

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:14.782
and you're gonna do god's work.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:16.984
- Wait, wait, just me?

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:18.719
I'm not ready for that.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:20.721
- Was Noah ready for that?

01:19:20.723 --> 01:19:22.289
Was Moses ready?

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.158
No, they were not ready,

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.530
but they did as god
commanded them to do.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:31.932
Now, are you gonna
disappoint god today,

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.802
or are you gonna go do his work?

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:35.736
- I'll go do his work.

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:37.238
- You're gonna do his work.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.439
Come on, let's go, Ashley.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:39.974
Come on.

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:52.853
- I need you to hear me, god.

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:59.193
Ryan and I said that
we decided to take

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:02.830
some time apart just so
everything can die down.

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:09.136
I think that's the
right thing to do.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:15.242
Just gimme a sign our
love is not wrong.

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:20.981
Please god, just gimme a sign.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:24.018
Just gimme a sign, gimme a sign.

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:37.398
Gimme a sign.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.100
Gimme a sign.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.777
Thank you, god.

01:20:49.779 --> 01:20:51.278
Thank you, god.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.314
- "Poison hath been
his timeless end.

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:55.115
"Oh, churl, drunk all,

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:58.953
"and left no friendly
drop to help me after.

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:02.323
"I will kiss thy lips."

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:05.926
- Emily, did you hear what
happened to Mr. Thompson?

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:06.760
- What?

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:07.995
- He quit.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:08.996
- What?

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:09.930
- Or got fired.

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.398
Jodie ritter was in the office,

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.202
and they already had over 100
complaints about the play.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.136
- What?

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.873
That's not fair.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.275
Now I'm never gonna
get to kiss a boy.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:22.309
- Kiss a boy?

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:25.746
What are you talking about?

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:28.549
Are you gay?

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:35.256
Like a hetero?

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:36.857
- I don't know what I am.

01:21:36.859 --> 01:21:38.292
- Paula was right.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:40.995
- Ian, please!

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:44.965
- I can't be friends
with you anymore.

01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:47.601
- Why not?

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:54.642
- People are gonna think I'm
like you, and that's gross.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:11.191
- You all know me to be a
man of not too many words.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.697
Why wolves?

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:19.300
Hmm?

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:22.136
Why do you think we
chose the timberwolf

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:24.872
to represent the
spirit of this team,

01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:28.809
this school, and this community?

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:32.880
Two words: Pack mentality.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:42.656
A wolf on its own,
it can survive, yeah,

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:44.124
but it's together--

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:44.925
- she's gonna freak
out when she sees this.

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:47.828
- That they thrive.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:51.765
- Hey,
look, there's turd-is.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.901
- There for each other, always.

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:02.977
And that's what we
will do as a team.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:07.848
We will support each other
on that field and off.

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:09.083
- Well, if it isn't
the little queer

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:11.151
who wants to kiss
my baby brother.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:11.986
- Stop it.

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:15.522
- Now, the crusaders,

01:23:15.524 --> 01:23:19.126
they out there thinking
they got our number today,

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:21.261
we gonna be weak,

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:27.701
caught up in petty
differences, innuendo.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.838
They may attack one of their
own for being different,

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.873
but not us.

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.942
Not the timberwolves.

01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:36.176
See, we're gonna show them

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.513
we are stronger when
we are challenged,

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:44.084
and we are stronger
when we are attacked.

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:45.352
- Do you wanna play
a game with us?

01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:47.888
- When one of us is attacked,

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:51.158
hell, when we're
attacked, we push back!

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.861
We're gonna go out there,
we're gonna run faster,

01:23:53.863 --> 01:23:55.696
we're gonna hit harder!

01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:56.630
- You guys go that way,
you guys follow me,

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:58.098
we'll cut her off at the fence.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.467
- And we're gonna bring home
a victory for all of us!

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:01.268
Who are we?

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.202
- Timberwolves!

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.003
- Who are we?

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:04.371
- Timberwolves!

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:08.308
- T wolves on three, let's go!

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:09.710
One, two, three!

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:10.644
- T wolves!

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:11.445
- Break!

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:14.481
All right, all right.

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.870
- Where you going, breeder?

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:39.006
- And
here comes Jude klein!

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:45.979
Look, look at her body language.

01:24:45.981 --> 01:24:47.781
Not at all the swagger

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:50.284
we're accustomed to
seeing from klein.

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:52.820
Will we see the end of
a win streak for Jude?

01:24:52.822 --> 01:24:55.022
- Come on, take the
field, let's go!

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:56.690
We're a pack, let's go!

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:57.991
- Come on, let's just
play some football, huh?

01:24:57.993 --> 01:24:59.259
Let's go.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.060
What are we doing?

01:25:00.062 --> 01:25:00.694
Come on, take the field!

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:01.662
Let's pack!

01:25:01.664 --> 01:25:02.596
Shut it out, let's go ladies!

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.264
- Come on, Jude, let's go.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:05.299
- Let's
go ladies, let's go!

01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:12.306
- Here we
are in the fourth quarter.

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:15.075
- 55 seconds, on one,
on one, ready, break!

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:16.510
- No
surprise, Jude has risen above--

01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:17.744
- where do you
think you're going, breeder?

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:18.946
Crowd usually seen

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.014
at the wolves'
away games though.

01:25:21.016 --> 01:25:21.982
- Klein's
still in command here,

01:25:21.984 --> 01:25:23.851
but down by a touchdown.

01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:25.319
The ball is snapped.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:28.956
- She
has Levy down on the sideline.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.424
Touchdown, timberwolves!

01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:32.159
Look at that, they
could tie the score now

01:25:32.161 --> 01:25:33.660
with the extra point.

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:35.929
- Have
you ever seen such desire

01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:39.533
in a player?

01:25:39.535 --> 01:25:40.834
- Don't
touch me, breeder.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.369
- Faggot!

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:43.804
- Get outta the stadium!

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:45.239
Getting no love whatsoever

01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:46.507
from her teammates.

01:25:46.509 --> 01:25:48.275
Really sad situation.

01:25:55.217 --> 01:25:58.385
- Ro, what is wrong with you?

01:25:58.387 --> 01:25:59.219
You're sick!

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.623
- Smear the queer!

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:03.724
Smear the queer!

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:10.297
- If
you're just joining us,

01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:11.965
Jude klein has brought
the timberwolves back

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:14.835
from 21 points down
to tie the game!

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.846
- No
doubt her personal choices have

01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:32.419
but you can't find fault.

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:33.520
Obviously, her team

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.556
has lost all respect for her,

01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:39.026
despite the performance
she has shown here tonight.

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:54.942
Oh, it's a fumble!

01:26:54.944 --> 01:26:57.244
The wolves recover,
they have the ball!

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:58.612
That's a miracle,

01:26:58.614 --> 01:27:00.113
keeping klein's streak alive.

01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:01.348
There you go.

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.383
Let's kick that field
goal and celebrate!

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:04.885
- And
coach Thompson not wasting

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:10.457
any time at all getting
special teams on the field.

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:16.163
- Klein, this has been
a hard game for you.

01:27:16.165 --> 01:27:17.631
I can put in the second
string if you want.

01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:21.034
- No, I got this.

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:22.536
Klein putting on her helmet.

01:27:22.538 --> 01:27:25.105
She's not leaving
anything to chance.

01:27:25.107 --> 01:27:26.373
Can't blame her, really.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:27.574
- I
haven't seen

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:28.809
the quarterback
fold since the '80s,

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:31.011
but I'm sure Thompson
wasn't about to say no--

01:27:31.013 --> 01:27:32.412
- let's go Jude!

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:33.647
Woo!

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.115
This is the kind of move

01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:37.918
that should tell everyone
what Jude is made of.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.386
- Any
scouts out there taking notice?

01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:41.588
You know it, you know it!

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:48.028
- Now
it looks like the huddle

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:51.765
is breaking up before
klein can get in.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.500
- Hey you.

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:56.803
I just wanted to let
you know I was safe.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:58.338
From where I am right now,

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:03.744
I have the most amazing view
of you in all of your glory.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:05.912
I love you.

01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:07.281
I'll see you soon.

01:28:07.283 --> 01:28:09.116
- Klein kneels for the snap.
- You're a queer!

01:28:09.118 --> 01:28:09.950
- You're a queer!

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:10.951
- No, let me go!

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:12.886
- Ow!

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:15.155
- You little bitch!

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:16.523
Smear the queer!

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:17.357
- Mommy!

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:18.325
- Smear the queer!

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:19.293
- Freak!

01:28:19.295 --> 01:28:20.460
Smear the queer!

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:24.131
- So
for the win here, 43 off,

01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:26.066
eight seconds left
in regulation.

01:28:26.068 --> 01:28:27.401
- You in?
- No more timeouts left

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:28.635
for either team.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.371
- Hey, let's
push it overtime.

01:28:31.373 --> 01:28:32.639
- Smear the queer!
- No!

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.441
- Smear the queer!
- Smear the queer!

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:44.685
- So, we playing a
little game of smear the queer?

01:28:44.687 --> 01:28:45.952
- Dumb queer!
- Breeder!

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:47.554
- Stop it, stop!
- Breeder!

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:48.955
- Stop!

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:50.090
The ball is set

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:50.891
after some discussion
on the field.

01:28:53.796 --> 01:28:55.395
- Ten hut!

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:56.229
Here's the snap!

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:58.832
- Smear the queer!

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.233
- No, no!

01:29:00.235 --> 01:29:01.635
Stop, stop!

01:29:01.637 --> 01:29:04.671
- Lori, gimme that.

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:11.912
- The whole
line is letting the crusaders

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:13.347
rush in untouched!

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:18.652
The kicker has
fallen to the ground!

01:29:18.654 --> 01:29:23.824
- Do us all a favor, 'ro.

01:29:24.993 --> 01:29:26.927
And kill yourself.

01:29:26.929 --> 01:29:33.867
- Ow!

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:34.801
Klein is getting hit

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:37.003
by the whole crusader team.

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:38.505
She fumbles the ball.

01:29:38.507 --> 01:29:41.875
The wolves are standing
around just doing nothing.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.110
- It's
completely out of hand.

01:29:43.112 --> 01:29:46.113
Her own team just
called a smear play.

01:29:46.115 --> 01:29:47.581
That's a disgrace.

01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:48.815
- The
referees have thrown a flag.

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:51.685
All the players are
actually celebrating.

01:29:51.687 --> 01:29:55.489
And klein is still buried under
a heap, a pile of players.

01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:56.923
Some people are gonna say

01:29:56.925 --> 01:29:58.792
this is what klein had
coming to her, but come on.

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:00.427
- Oh,
just a vicious attack.

01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:07.100
Coaches are running onto
the field right now.

01:30:07.102 --> 01:30:12.272
- Die, breeder!

01:30:12.274 --> 01:30:13.774
Klein is not moving,

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:16.042
and they're bringing in
the stretcher as we speak.

01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:19.413
- God hates you, Curtis.

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:20.247
- Get back!

01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:21.114
Get outta the way!

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:27.120
You're okay, you'll be fine.

01:30:27.122 --> 01:30:29.055
- You're fine.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.947
- Just breathe.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:55.348
We're gonna take care
of you, all right?

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:13.600
- Sinner, sinner, sinner!

01:31:13.602 --> 01:31:15.268
Never asked forgiveness,

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:18.071
but is subject to
eternal condemnation!

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:57.677
- What more can you do?!

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.279
This is god's work?

01:31:59.281 --> 01:32:02.482
That's what you're doing?

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:05.051
You better pray to
god she's all right!

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:10.090
- Oh there
he is, there he is!

01:32:10.092 --> 01:32:10.924
- Are you ready?

01:32:10.926 --> 01:32:12.359
Are you rolling?

01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:16.596
Okay, let's get in the
coach, come on, go go go go!

01:32:16.598 --> 01:32:17.764
- Grab him, grab him!

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.066
Get him, get him!

01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:21.968
- Any comment on what
happened here tonight?

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:33.947
- Quiet, quiet!

01:32:33.949 --> 01:32:36.516
Listen to me!

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:39.653
We prayed for you,
Ryan, we all did,

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:43.957
and this is what we came
to, revelations, chapter 16!

01:32:43.959 --> 01:32:46.159
We are here to cleanse you.

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:49.829
We are here to cleanse you
because we are the seven angels

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:54.367
and we are doing god's work.

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:55.435
You get that?

01:32:55.437 --> 01:32:57.504
Good, good.

01:32:57.506 --> 01:32:59.806
Come on, get him to me!

01:32:59.808 --> 01:33:01.841
Wait, let me call the reverend.

01:33:01.843 --> 01:33:04.477
She'll know what to do.

01:33:04.479 --> 01:33:05.412
- Reverend Rachel.

01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:06.646
- Reverend Rachel!

01:33:06.648 --> 01:33:08.381
It's bill Bradley
from omega theta pi.

01:33:08.383 --> 01:33:09.482
- Hey,
bill, how are you?

01:33:09.484 --> 01:33:11.351
What can I do for you?

01:33:11.353 --> 01:33:13.987
- We want to save
that hetero guy

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.388
that was involved
with the quarterback.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:16.623
- Really?

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.091
Okay, well, have you
been praying about it?

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.326
- Yes, ma'am.

01:33:19.328 --> 01:33:21.328
We just need your
blessing first.

01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:22.729
- Well, you're
doing god's work.

01:33:22.731 --> 01:33:23.997
You let the lord be with you

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:26.967
and all your questions
are gonna be answered.

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:28.134
- You heard it, boys.

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:30.570
We're doing god's work!

01:33:30.572 --> 01:33:31.938
Come on, get him down!

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.141
Get him!

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:36.276
Congratulations, reverend,

01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:39.212
you're now an accessory
to a hate crime.

01:33:39.214 --> 01:33:40.146
- Hello!
- You can't get me!

01:33:40.148 --> 01:33:41.848
You can't get me, see, oh!

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.317
- Do I hear trouble?

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:45.852
- Mom, come quick!

01:33:45.854 --> 01:33:47.287
- No!
- Oh, woman down!

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:50.423
- Oh woman must leave
and we save this dragon.

01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:51.725
- I think I need a kiss.

01:33:51.727 --> 01:33:53.860
- Oh.

01:33:53.862 --> 01:33:55.328
Let me see those.

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.130
- Tell him
i left him $10,000

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.766
in the cookie jar if I die.

01:33:59.768 --> 01:34:00.934
- I'm sorry,
i couldn't hear that.

01:34:00.936 --> 01:34:02.102
One more time, please?

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:03.336
- Don't
forget to fix the car.

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:04.170
- Did you know that?

01:34:04.172 --> 01:34:05.005
Hi honey!

01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:10.777
Fix the car, that's the
most important part.

01:34:10.779 --> 01:34:16.216
Oh my god.

01:34:16.218 --> 01:34:17.217
- What is that?

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:20.387
- Oh my god.

01:34:20.389 --> 01:34:22.155
Oh my god, Emily, what happened?

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.523
Come here, honey.

01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:25.525
Oh my god, baby.

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:26.960
What?

01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:28.361
- What happened?

01:34:28.363 --> 01:34:29.396
- What, come here, hon.

01:34:29.398 --> 01:34:31.765
- Stop, no!
- Honey.

01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:33.299
- Who did this to you?
- Who did this to you?

01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:34.134
- Nobody.

01:34:34.136 --> 01:34:35.168
- Emily!

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:36.536
What happened to you?

01:34:36.538 --> 01:34:37.370
I'm talking to you!

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:38.571
What happened to you?

01:34:38.573 --> 01:34:39.906
- Vicki, stop.

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:40.840
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
- Who did this?

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:41.941
- Lemme look at this.

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:44.310
- Who did this?!

01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:45.412
- Nobody.

01:34:45.414 --> 01:34:46.646
- It's gonna be okay, honey.

01:34:46.648 --> 01:34:47.714
Who did this?

01:34:47.716 --> 01:34:48.915
- Emily!

01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:49.749
Who did this?

01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:51.284
Emily!

01:34:51.286 --> 01:34:55.789
- Paula santilli and
Annabelle snyder.

01:34:55.791 --> 01:35:02.028
- Ian's sister?

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.463
- This is your fault.

01:35:03.465 --> 01:35:04.698
- What, how is this my fault?

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.232
- You took her
over to the neighbors'.

01:35:06.234 --> 01:35:07.801
I know about that.

01:35:07.803 --> 01:35:11.538
- Would you...

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.174
Go to your room
and get cleaned up.

01:35:14.176 --> 01:35:15.709
Cooper?

01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:20.580
Cooper, earmuffs.

01:35:20.582 --> 01:35:21.848
- But I want my tanks.

01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:23.283
- Hold onto
your tanks, just go.

01:35:23.285 --> 01:35:24.984
Play with them in the kitchen.

01:35:24.986 --> 01:35:26.186
This is my fault?

01:35:26.188 --> 01:35:27.520
- Yeah,
this is your fault.

01:35:27.522 --> 01:35:29.089
- How is this my fault?

01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:30.590
- Yes, it's your
fault, you coddle her.

01:35:30.592 --> 01:35:31.891
You act like this is normal!

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.226
Have you seen what
they do to these kids?

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:34.461
- Keep your
voice down, honey.

01:35:34.463 --> 01:35:35.662
- I'm not gonna
keep my voice down!

01:35:35.664 --> 01:35:36.863
I don't feel like
keeping my voice down!

01:35:36.865 --> 01:35:37.831
- Don't
you dare tell our--

01:35:37.833 --> 01:35:39.232
- I've had it!
- Daughter that!

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:40.066
- She is confused.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:41.000
- Confused?

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:42.402
- Yes!
- My ass!

01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:43.603
- She brings
this on herself

01:35:43.605 --> 01:35:45.739
by acting like that
with this play!

01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:47.574
This is enough of this!

01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:49.909
I'm not having a breeder
growing up in my house.

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.211
- Do you hear what
you're saying?

01:35:51.213 --> 01:35:52.078
- Yeah, I hear what I'm saying.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.213
- No.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:01.221
- Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up,

01:36:01.223 --> 01:36:05.158
shut up, shut up, shut up.

01:36:06.661 --> 01:36:07.961
- I gotta go.

01:36:07.963 --> 01:36:10.230
- Oh, Susan, it's you.

01:36:10.232 --> 01:36:11.598
- Jude!

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.566
Hi.

01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:16.002
- Where's Ryan?

01:36:16.004 --> 01:36:16.970
Where's Ryan?

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:19.572
- I'm not sure.

01:36:19.574 --> 01:36:22.575
I called him a few times.

01:36:22.577 --> 01:36:23.777
- Ryan.

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.411
- But I'm gonna
try him again, okay?

01:36:25.413 --> 01:36:26.346
We'll find him.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:33.153
- Stop here, stop here!

01:36:33.155 --> 01:36:34.154
- Woo!
- Fuck yeah!

01:36:34.156 --> 01:36:35.655
- Woo!
- Get out of the car!

01:36:35.657 --> 01:36:37.957
- Come on!
- Woo!

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:38.792
- Get him out!

01:36:38.794 --> 01:36:39.626
Get him out!

01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:40.460
Get him out!

01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:43.563
- Oh, tonight
is your night, baby!

01:36:43.565 --> 01:36:45.398
- Here we go, here we go!

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:49.969
Oh that's right, that's
right, stand him up!

01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:50.904
Stand him up!

01:36:50.906 --> 01:36:52.105
- Stand him up, baby!

01:36:52.107 --> 01:36:55.074
- Get him up.

01:36:55.076 --> 01:36:56.075
- Woo!
- Stand him up!

01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:57.544
- Stand him up!

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:07.387
Come on!

01:37:07.389 --> 01:37:08.555
Come on!

01:37:13.628 --> 01:37:15.995
Get him away!

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:17.397
Get that hetero
faggot away from me!

01:37:17.399 --> 01:37:21.134
- Woo!

01:37:21.136 --> 01:37:22.602
- You want a Ryan Morris?

01:37:22.604 --> 01:37:24.037
Is that what you want, another
Ryan Morris on your hands?

01:37:24.039 --> 01:37:26.439
I wouldn't want...

01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:27.941
- Stop it.

01:37:27.943 --> 01:37:29.175
Why have we been going to
church all these years?

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:30.343
Why have we brought
our children up here?

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:31.277
So the minute something--

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:32.212
- I don't want to calm down!

01:37:32.214 --> 01:37:36.149
I wanna get this kid together!

01:37:36.151 --> 01:37:37.350
Have you thought about that?

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:39.819
Have you seen what
they do to these kids?

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:09.282
- Come on!

01:38:09.284 --> 01:38:11.651
Get that hetero
faggot away from me!

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:12.485
Take him up!

01:38:13.421 --> 01:38:15.355
- Move it, move it, breeder!

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:19.993
Get him away!

01:38:23.198 --> 01:38:26.466
- Come on!

01:38:27.802 --> 01:38:29.502
Come on, get him!

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:30.603
Get him!

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:31.671
Yeah!

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:37.343
Yeah, get him!

01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:38.278
Get him!
- Get him, boys!

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.445
- Get him!

01:38:39.447 --> 01:38:41.614
Come on, come on, come on!

01:38:41.616 --> 01:38:43.783
Yeah, yeah, get him!

01:38:47.856 --> 01:38:49.522
Yeah!

01:38:49.524 --> 01:38:52.258
Let me see your face, huh, huh?

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:58.798
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.199
Okay, listen, he's had enough!

01:39:00.201 --> 01:39:02.902
Okay, okay, okay!

01:39:02.904 --> 01:39:04.170
I said okay!

01:39:04.172 --> 01:39:05.271
I think he gets the
message, guys, okay.

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:06.105
Let's just clear out--

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.974
- hey, hey, hey.

01:39:10.312 --> 01:39:13.246
- Stop it!
- Yo, yo!

01:39:13.248 --> 01:39:14.180
- He's had enough!

01:39:14.182 --> 01:39:16.549
- I say when he's had enough.

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:17.684
What's wrong with you, Mike?

01:39:17.686 --> 01:39:18.952
Huh?

01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:21.454
Don't tell me you got
some sort of soft spot

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:23.856
for this candy-ass 'ro, huh?

01:39:25.427 --> 01:39:28.661
Prove it.

01:39:28.663 --> 01:39:29.829
I said prove it.

01:39:29.831 --> 01:39:31.331
We're just getting started.

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:33.333
- I don't have to prove
anything to anybody, okay?

01:39:33.335 --> 01:39:35.134
Bill, this isn't right.

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:36.069
What are you gonna do
- Mike!

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:37.003
- With this thing?

01:39:37.005 --> 01:39:37.837
- Get him!

01:39:41.276 --> 01:39:44.444
Get him!

01:39:44.446 --> 01:39:45.678
Hold him down!

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.280
Get him, come on!

01:39:47.282 --> 01:39:48.348
Come on!

01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:49.749
Get him!

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:50.883
Come on!

01:39:50.885 --> 01:39:51.751
Come on, get him down!

01:39:51.753 --> 01:39:53.786
Get him down!

01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:55.755
Hey, hey!

01:39:55.757 --> 01:39:56.889
Come on, move him!

01:39:56.891 --> 01:39:58.157
Move him!

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:00.526
Oh Ryan, I am not
done with you yet.

01:40:00.528 --> 01:40:01.394
- Hetero breeders!

01:40:12.139 --> 01:40:14.040
Die, breeders!

01:40:14.976 --> 01:40:16.442

01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.816
We're gonna play a game,
and you're gonna hit him.

01:40:23.818 --> 01:40:26.619
And on a scale of one to
10, I'm gonna grade you.

01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:27.453

01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:28.755

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:19.906
- Queer!

01:41:29.084 --> 01:41:32.785
Dirty breeder!

01:41:32.787 --> 01:41:34.253
- Paula?

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:37.590
Is that you?

01:41:37.592 --> 01:41:40.493
What are you smiling
about young lady, huh?

01:41:40.495 --> 01:41:41.894
You're late.

01:41:41.896 --> 01:41:43.129
- Practice ran long.

01:41:43.131 --> 01:41:44.530
- You look at me when
I'm talking to you.

01:41:44.532 --> 01:41:46.432
How come Ian was home
in time for dinner, huh?

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:49.202
- I don't know, maybe because
he's just a lame towel boy?

01:41:49.204 --> 01:41:50.636
- Paula, stop that.

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:53.473
And what is that on your cheek?

01:41:53.475 --> 01:41:57.610
- Oh, that little creep
Emily turd-is kicked me.

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:58.544
- She what?

01:41:58.546 --> 01:42:01.414
- Why would she do that?

01:42:01.416 --> 01:42:04.217
- We taught her a lesson.

01:42:04.219 --> 01:42:05.785
Reverend Rachel says we're
supposed to do god's work

01:42:05.787 --> 01:42:07.420
and kill 'em all.

01:42:07.422 --> 01:42:08.521
- Batter batter batter!

01:42:08.523 --> 01:42:10.356
Hey batter batter!

Hey, hey you're

01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:18.431
Huh?

01:42:18.433 --> 01:42:19.799
You're gonna remember this.

01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:20.833
- Come on, bill, let's go.

01:42:20.835 --> 01:42:22.201
- You hear me?

01:42:22.203 --> 01:42:23.436

01:42:23.438 --> 01:42:24.704
- You got some kind
of problem, Mike?

01:42:24.706 --> 01:42:26.672
- You want
to hit him again?

01:42:26.674 --> 01:42:27.874
- Mike.
- Step aside.

01:42:27.876 --> 01:42:30.910
- Mike.
- Step aside now.

01:42:30.912 --> 01:42:33.513
- No no no no no.

01:42:33.515 --> 01:42:34.413
- Sammy?

01:42:34.415 --> 01:42:35.815
- Mike's right.

01:42:35.817 --> 01:42:37.683
This is not okay.

01:42:37.685 --> 01:42:39.218
We need to move outta here.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:42.555
- This is wrong, bill.

01:42:42.557 --> 01:42:48.861
All of you, this is wrong!

01:42:48.863 --> 01:42:50.463
- Okay, boys, you're right.

01:42:50.465 --> 01:42:52.765
All right.

01:42:52.767 --> 01:42:54.167
Let's go.

01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:57.670
I just gotta say
one more prayer.

01:42:57.672 --> 01:43:00.006
All of you, go on, go ahead!

01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:25.665
Okay.

01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:31.537
Revelations, chapter
17, verse 16.

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:39.579
The seventh angel
poured out his vial

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:46.285
into the air.

01:43:46.287 --> 01:43:49.288
And there came a great voice

01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:52.391
out of the kingdom of heaven,

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:56.662
from the throne, saying,

01:43:56.664 --> 01:44:01.100
"it is done."

01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:03.135
- Please help me.

01:44:03.137 --> 01:44:07.573
- We are doing god's work!

01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:15.014
- Smear the queer!

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:15.948
Smear the queer!

01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:18.084
Ugly hetero!

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:22.121
Die breeder!

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.127
Romeo and Juliet?

01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:30.596
That's so queer.

01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:34.267
What are you Emily,
some kinda 'ro?

01:44:34.269 --> 01:44:35.101
- I'm not
gonna have a breeder

01:44:35.103 --> 01:44:36.435
growing up in my house.

01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:38.371
- She's sick
and she needs help!

01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:46.145
- 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro,
'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro!

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.515
- I don't know,

01:45:22.517 --> 01:45:25.484
guess she didn't like
playing smear the queer.

01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:26.952
- What?
- What did you do to Emily?

01:45:30.858 --> 01:45:32.325
- It's disgusting,
and I'm not gonna have it!

01:45:32.327 --> 01:45:34.160
- Calm down, honey.

01:45:34.162 --> 01:45:35.594
- What about Cooper?

01:45:35.596 --> 01:45:36.529
- Just please calm down.
- Have you thought about that?

01:45:36.531 --> 01:45:38.097
What if he gets beat up too?

01:45:38.099 --> 01:45:39.332
- Excuse me?
- Oh my god.

01:45:39.334 --> 01:45:40.032
- I only beat her
up a little bit.

01:45:40.034 --> 01:45:41.300
- Wait, wait.

01:45:41.302 --> 01:45:42.902
Honey, please get the
curtises on the phone.

01:45:42.904 --> 01:45:44.136
- Yep.

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:44.937
- You can
explain to all of us

01:45:44.939 --> 01:45:46.472
what you did to Emily,

01:45:46.474 --> 01:45:48.441
and you can apologize to her
as well, and to her parents.

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.857
- I'm trying
to protect her.

01:46:04.859 --> 01:46:07.560
- I understand that.

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:14.600
- It's Pete santilli.

01:46:14.602 --> 01:46:17.603
Curtis residence?

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:40.860
- Yeah, completely unacceptable.

01:46:40.862 --> 01:46:43.963
She would like to apologize,
if that's okay with you.

01:46:43.965 --> 01:46:44.797
- Yeah, we appreciate it.

01:46:44.799 --> 01:46:46.265
Hang on, I'll get her.

01:46:46.267 --> 01:46:47.199
It's Pete.

01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:48.434
Paula wants to apologize.

01:46:48.436 --> 01:46:53.873
- Oh, good.

01:46:53.875 --> 01:46:54.807
You know what?

01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:55.975
She's probably washing up.

01:46:55.977 --> 01:46:57.143
I'm just gonna
bring her the phone.

01:46:57.145 --> 01:46:59.845
You stay right
here and calm down.

01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:14.160
- People are gonna
think I'm like you.

01:47:14.162 --> 01:47:20.199
And that's gross.

01:47:21.335 --> 01:47:23.636
Emily.

01:47:23.638 --> 01:47:25.070
Emily?

01:47:25.072 --> 01:47:28.441
You've got a phone call, hon.

01:47:28.443 --> 01:47:29.675
Honey?

01:47:29.677 --> 01:47:31.143
Are you okay?

01:47:31.145 --> 01:47:33.412
- Do us all a favor,
'ro, and kill yourself.

01:47:33.414 --> 01:47:35.014
- Honey, you okay?

01:47:35.016 --> 01:47:38.150
- Poured out
his vial into the air.

01:47:38.152 --> 01:47:42.555
And there came a great voice
from the kingdom of heaven,

01:47:42.557 --> 01:47:47.726
from the throne.

01:47:47.728 --> 01:47:49.829
We are doing god's work!

01:47:51.599 --> 01:47:53.365
- Emily?

01:47:53.367 --> 01:47:54.700
Emily?

01:47:54.702 --> 01:47:56.402
Open the door.

01:47:56.404 --> 01:47:57.236
Open the door!

01:48:01.876 --> 01:48:03.075
Honey!

01:48:03.077 --> 01:48:05.010
Open the door right now!

01:48:05.012 --> 01:48:06.946
Vicki!

01:48:08.616 --> 01:48:10.749
Oh god, Vicki, Vicki!

01:48:10.751 --> 01:48:12.685
- Hang on, back
off, back off, back off.

01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:16.889
Now push it with me.

01:50:55.915 --> 01:51:01.253
- Could Jude and I...

01:51:01.255 --> 01:51:02.521
Maybe we can go visit?

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:54.039
- I wrote something down.

01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:56.742
I don't know how to do this.

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:11.457
I truly believe that--

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:17.496
that once in your
life you meet someone,

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:23.102
someone who just changes
your whole world around.

01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:32.778
I thank god,

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:36.682
thank god for showing
me how to love someone,

01:52:36.684 --> 01:52:38.717
for giving me Ryan.

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:55.300
Someone once told me this
quote you may have heard of.

01:52:55.302 --> 01:52:59.037
"Give me my Romeo,
and when he shall die,

01:52:59.039 --> 01:53:04.910
"take him and cut him
out into little stars,

01:53:04.912 --> 01:53:07.946
"and he will make the
face of heaven so fine

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.891
"because the only thing
that lasts forever is love."

01:53:31.871 --> 01:53:33.372
- Hi.

01:53:33.374 --> 01:53:34.907
- Hi.

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:46.084
- Why do people hate us so much?

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:58.764
- I guess they don't
understand love like ours.

01:53:58.766 --> 01:54:02.034
Maybe they never will.

01:54:02.036 --> 01:54:07.840
- Well, isn't our love
the same as theirs?

01:54:07.842 --> 01:54:13.679
- It is.

01:54:13.681 --> 01:54:17.282
- Maybe someone should
teach them that.

01:54:17.284 --> 01:54:21.053
- Emily.

01:54:21.055 --> 01:54:22.387
- Bye.

01:54:22.389 --> 01:54:23.422
- Bye.

01:54:39.739 --> 01:54:44.843
- How can
i help you, sister?

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:10.669
- First book of Peter,
verse four, line eight.

01:55:10.671 --> 01:55:15.707
"Above all, love
each other deeply,

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:26.518
"because love covers over
a multitude of sins."

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.221
I think that covers my sin.

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.861
How about yours?

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.739
- Hey, you.

01:55:47.741 --> 01:55:51.376
I just wanted to let you
know that I was safe,

01:55:51.378 --> 01:55:56.081
and from where I am right now,

01:55:56.083 --> 01:56:01.019
I have an amazing view of
you in all of your glory.

01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:04.056
I love you.

01:56:04.058 --> 01:56:09.461
See you soon.

01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:11.863
Hey you.

01:56:11.865 --> 01:56:15.467
I just wanted to let you
know that I was safe,

01:56:15.469 --> 01:56:20.272
and from where I am right now,

01:56:20.274 --> 01:56:26.244
I have an amazing view of
you in all of your glory.

01:56:26.246 --> 01:56:29.381
I love you.

01:56:29.383 --> 01:56:30.916
See you soon.

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:42.861
Hey, you.

01:56:42.863 --> 01:56:46.565
I just wanted to let you
know that I was safe,

01:56:46.567 --> 01:56:51.370
and from where I am right now,

01:56:51.372 --> 01:56:54.873
I have an amazing view of
you in all of your glory.

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:01.813
I love you.

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:03.348
See you soon.
