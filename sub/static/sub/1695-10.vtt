00:00.607 --> 00:02.402
Ed Bader's up for reelection.

00:02.522 --> 00:03.864
You know how he got to be mayor?

00:04.086 --> 00:05.474
You wanted him to be.

00:05.721 --> 00:07.096
You're going to
work at his office.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.734
All I require is that you
keep your eyes and ears open.

00:09.854 --> 00:11.131
I spoke to Rothstein.

00:11.251 --> 00:13.682
Masseria squeezed him out
of the heroin business.

00:13.802 --> 00:16.522
I should like to meet with Mr.
Masseria.

00:16.642 --> 00:20.320
Petrucelli's the biggest importer
of heroin in the whole southeast.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.794
Go back to Tampa.

00:21.914 --> 00:24.048
Those trucks he send up
here with the rum...

00:24.168 --> 00:26.418
maybe they carry
something for us, too.

00:26.538 --> 00:29.844
- Say hello to Abe Redstone.
- Pleasure to make...

00:31.157 --> 00:33.795
I will thank you in advance
for your discretion.

00:33.915 --> 00:35.848
I'm assuming a
reciprocal arrangement

00:35.968 --> 00:37.830
would be to your advantage?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.591
- It would.
- Then until next time.

00:40.973 --> 00:43.375
Mr. White is alive,

00:43.495 --> 00:46.813
and you have crushed me.

00:48.223 --> 00:50.158
Let me see you, girl.

00:51.164 --> 00:53.713
Stand up. Stand your ass up!

00:53.833 --> 00:56.116
Think about what comes
out of your mouth next

00:56.236 --> 00:59.438
unless you are ready for a war
that you will fight alone.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.358
We're agents of the
Bureau of Investigation.

01:05.477 --> 01:08.447
Bring us your brother along with
the criminals he conspires with.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.547
And your son stays a free man.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.863
And you get to hold
on to what matters.

- ( bicycle bell rings )
- ( laughter )

03:02.550 --> 03:04.688
I don't know exactly
his position,

03:04.721 --> 03:06.520
but he's bigtime over there.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.962
- Knox: This is Balanchuk?
- Yeah.

03:08.995 --> 03:11.700
And you've dealt with him
directly in Atlantic City?

03:11.733 --> 03:14.905
Once or twice when he was Torrio's runner.
I don't know.

03:14.946 --> 03:16.313
You don't know?

03:16.346 --> 03:19.547
Not since he got bumped up.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.423
Joseph Balanchuk.
What is that, Polish?

03:22.456 --> 03:23.592
It's Ukrainian.

03:23.626 --> 03:26.057
I thought Torrio only
worked with Italians.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.296
Does he?

03:27.329 --> 03:28.893
It's a syndicate,
for Christ's sake.

03:28.926 --> 03:31.091
- Consisting of?
- Italians, sure.

03:31.124 --> 03:33.196
All kinds of greaseballs.

03:33.229 --> 03:35.229
Jews.

03:35.270 --> 03:37.368
He's got this one, Jake
Guzik, runs his breweries.

03:37.402 --> 03:39.976
But this Balanchuk, he's
high up the ladder?

03:40.041 --> 03:41.640
Very high.

03:41.673 --> 03:44.946
He's like Torrio's second.

03:49.557 --> 03:51.452
- Bring it up here, will you?
- Right, boss.

03:53.355 --> 03:54.521
Hungry?

03:54.554 --> 03:57.224
My dad was a sea dog.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.162
Tattoo of a mermaid
on his forearm.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.465
See the world.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.102
I bet that sounds pretty
good to you right now.

04:10.938 --> 04:13.380
I know this is difficult.

04:13.413 --> 04:16.012
But what you're doing
takes courage.

04:17.947 --> 04:19.848
You're a good father.

04:29.992 --> 04:34.061
( Music playing )

04:44.571 --> 04:46.475
Get that. Come on. Let's
get that unloaded.

04:46.508 --> 04:48.548
Let's go.

04:48.581 --> 04:52.379
( Chatter )

04:52.420 --> 04:54.620
( overlapping voices ) They
ain't gonna move themselves.

04:54.644 --> 04:56.926
Come on, let's just give
me a hand over here.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.326
Give me another barrel
of them oranges here.

05:00.494 --> 05:02.490
- Go. We're done.
- All right.

05:02.523 --> 05:04.656
- Almost there.
- How many more crates left?

05:04.697 --> 05:07.097
- Just a few.
- You still here?

05:07.130 --> 05:09.130
Ain't a mirage, lady.

05:09.203 --> 05:12.298
Those trucks got to be on the
road in half an hour, McCoy.

05:12.339 --> 05:14.505
I'm at sea for three weeks.

05:14.538 --> 05:16.471
Just catching up with the boys.

05:16.504 --> 05:18.935
That sort of look like a woman.

05:18.976 --> 05:21.947
In the right light, I suppose.

05:21.980 --> 05:25.451
How would you pole jockeys
know what a woman looks like?

05:25.484 --> 05:27.988
Last call's over.
Move your asses.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.188
You two still got them
full boxes here to load.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.989
Let's go. Come on, get 'em out.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.204

05:50.124 --> 05:52.057

balls off in there.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.993
( Petrucelli speaking Italian )

05:57.133 --> 06:00.131
Should make Joe happy.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.632
Tell him to come down next time.

06:02.665 --> 06:05.735
Let's move it along. I'm
on a schedule, fellas.

06:05.768 --> 06:07.073
Keep an eye on these finocchi.

06:07.106 --> 06:09.611
Caught one of them trying
to steal some of our hooch.

06:09.644 --> 06:12.316

06:38.286 --> 06:40.454
Nucky: You were supposed to
call me three hours ago.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.359
Sally: You miss me? Aw, shucks.

06:43.393 --> 06:46.298
This is business, which
runs on a schedule.

06:46.331 --> 06:48.760
You call me just to say hello.

06:48.793 --> 06:51.029
Nucky: Is that what this is?

06:51.062 --> 06:54.366
No. Something's wrong.

06:54.399 --> 06:56.871
Sid: Nuck, I'm hanging up now.

06:56.904 --> 06:58.575
What is it?

06:58.608 --> 07:00.104
Sid: I said I'm hanging up.

07:00.145 --> 07:02.341
I wasn't talking to you!

07:04.143 --> 07:05.742
So what's the problem? Tell me.

07:05.775 --> 07:08.679
Sally: That wop you're in
bed with, Petrucelli...

07:08.712 --> 07:10.416
He's pulling a fast one.

07:10.449 --> 07:11.855
How so?

07:11.888 --> 07:15.190
Turns out, rum ain't the
only thing you're running.

07:15.223 --> 07:17.959
Him and the other ones,
Luciano and his partner...

07:17.992 --> 07:19.327
Lansky.

07:20.528 --> 07:22.359
- Who's there?
- McCoy.

07:22.399 --> 07:24.766
He's with me. Anyway...

07:24.799 --> 07:27.967
turns out they're stashing
heroin in with your hooch

07:28.032 --> 07:30.072
and trucking it north.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.009
And you know this how?

07:33.042 --> 07:36.144
A girl has her ways.

07:38.178 --> 07:40.617
- You tell anyone besides McCoy?
- ( laughs )

07:40.650 --> 07:43.553
I prefer to live near
the swamp, not in it.

07:43.586 --> 07:46.226
- Well, keep him close by.
- Do I have to?

07:46.259 --> 07:48.093
Yes.

07:48.158 --> 07:50.693
And, Sally, I owe you one.

07:50.734 --> 07:53.428
And don't think I
don't know it, sport.

- Knox: Said how he's too old.
- ( others laugh ) Aw.

08:19.627 --> 08:21.393
What are you doing here?

08:21.426 --> 08:24.024
I like to know what my
clients are insuring.

08:24.057 --> 08:25.624
Keeps me inspired.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.497
I understand you've
bought a policy.

08:27.530 --> 08:28.930
Knox: Whole life.

08:28.963 --> 08:31.633
When it matures, you'll be sitting
on a nice little nest egg.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.063
Let's hope it doesn't hatch.

08:33.104 --> 08:34.933
( laughs )

08:34.966 --> 08:36.602
Quite a boy you've got here.

08:36.635 --> 08:39.438
Left college to take a position
with the mayor's office?

08:39.471 --> 08:41.309
That's what I call gumption.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.383
What is it you want
exactly, Mr...

08:46.416 --> 08:47.813
Balanchuk.

08:47.846 --> 08:50.850
I recently transferred
from the Chicago office.

08:51.779 --> 08:53.385
Mr. Balanchuk.

08:53.418 --> 08:56.098
I just need to go over a few documents
and I'll be out of your hair.

08:56.122 --> 08:59.392
We'll move into the kitchen,
give you some privacy.

09:00.352 --> 09:01.856
You should thank your father.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.225
He knows that in an instant,

09:04.258 --> 09:07.835
tragedy can strike and
everything a man's worked for,

09:07.867 --> 09:11.729
everything he loves,
everything he holds dear...

09:11.770 --> 09:13.939
( snaps fingers ) can be gone.

09:19.179 --> 09:21.115
Get to work now, huh?

09:21.148 --> 09:22.844
Yes, sir.

09:37.391 --> 09:40.359
You come to my fuckin' house?

09:40.392 --> 09:42.998
Joseph Balanchuk has
been dead for two years.

09:43.031 --> 09:44.629
John Torrio paid
for his funeral.

09:44.662 --> 09:46.130
They don't update
me on turnover.

09:46.163 --> 09:47.959
Playing me for a chump?

09:47.992 --> 09:50.096
You asked what I know.
That's what I know.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.894
Next time, know better.

09:52.936 --> 09:54.430
Or as God is my judge,

09:54.463 --> 09:56.268
that bright-eyed
young son of yours

09:56.301 --> 09:58.606
will be breaking
rocks up at Trenton.

10:02.113 --> 10:03.943
Everything okay?

10:03.976 --> 10:05.575
Yeah. Just a spill.

10:10.215 --> 10:12.858
That was some good coffee.
Thank you.

10:18.025 --> 10:19.991
( Machines chugging )

10:20.024 --> 10:23.264
- ( phones ringing )
- Price still hasn't come in yet.

10:28.107 --> 10:30.440
Yes, please hold for Mrs. Rohan.

10:31.408 --> 10:34.505
Hello? Yes, this is she.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.212
I'm calling in regard

10:36.245 --> 10:38.684
to your advertisement
in the "Herald."

10:39.948 --> 10:41.849
The apartments in Inwood.

10:43.721 --> 10:46.153
No, I am unmarried.

10:47.588 --> 10:50.661
Recently widowed, actually.

10:53.628 --> 10:56.528
A personal tour would be grand.

10:56.561 --> 10:57.799
( Pencil snaps )

10:57.832 --> 11:01.169
And in terms of rent, is that...

11:06.211 --> 11:07.505
I...

11:07.546 --> 11:09.544
I'm sorry. I'll have
to call you back.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.481
Changing your residence?

11:18.217 --> 11:21.590
I... just considering
my options.

11:21.624 --> 11:24.362
Mr. Bennett is still at lunch.

11:24.395 --> 11:27.066
May I get you something, Mr.
Redstone?

11:27.099 --> 11:29.529
Have you any milk?

11:29.562 --> 11:31.432
Certainly.

11:35.538 --> 11:39.841
May I inquire as to your salary, Mrs.
Rohan?

11:42.041 --> 11:44.144
$11 per week.

11:44.177 --> 11:47.648
With the occasional bonus
for good performance.

11:47.681 --> 11:51.753
That's $572 annually

11:51.786 --> 11:55.222
with a prospective yearly
rental of over half that.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.254
I imagine you're frugal,

11:57.288 --> 12:00.791
but subtracting for the grocer,

12:00.824 --> 12:04.526
transportation, clothing,
sundries and what have you,

12:04.567 --> 12:06.996
it seems these
particular quarters

12:07.029 --> 12:09.028
are above your means.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.206
I fail to see what
business this is of yours.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.582
May I offer you
some free advice?

12:22.184 --> 12:24.521
Is there anything more
expensive in the world?

12:26.856 --> 12:29.190
Forget this place and call me.

12:29.223 --> 12:31.390
I own several buildings uptown.

12:31.423 --> 12:33.824
Perhaps I could steer you

12:33.865 --> 12:36.729
to more suitable accommodations.

12:41.305 --> 12:43.473
In exchange for what?

12:52.857 --> 12:55.426
Your boss, Mr. Bennett,

12:55.491 --> 12:59.270
he and his ilk are
systematically driving down

12:59.303 --> 13:01.504
the price of Anaconda
Realty stock,

13:01.537 --> 13:04.102
in which I'm invested.

13:04.143 --> 13:08.079
Soon, no doubt, they
plan on buying it back.

13:09.713 --> 13:12.082
I need to know
when this happens.

13:14.893 --> 13:16.891
I could lose my job.

13:16.924 --> 13:18.490
Yes, you could.

13:18.523 --> 13:22.361
Or perhaps gain
something better.

13:24.868 --> 13:27.606
( laughs ) Come on,
Abe, quit flirting.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.701
Hello, Robert.

13:36.987 --> 13:39.251
Nice chatting with you, Mrs.
Rohan.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.491
Bennett: Got something
special coming in.

13:43.524 --> 13:46.460
You're the first
person I thought of.

13:47.461 --> 13:49.796
He show his face around here,

13:49.837 --> 13:52.531
him or one of his boys, you
get word to me right quick.

13:52.572 --> 13:54.770
Ain't seen a hair of the
doctor since the other night.

13:54.803 --> 13:56.905
Ain't heard his
speechifying neither.

13:56.938 --> 13:59.537
His jabbering days
be over soon enough.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.842
Tonight we pay a visit
down the Northside

14:02.875 --> 14:05.715
- and see how he...
- ( trash clatters )

14:07.548 --> 14:09.419
Back in the kitchen, ofay.

14:09.452 --> 14:11.556
This here private.

14:11.622 --> 14:13.897
So this here the new
dishwasher Nucky hire?

14:13.930 --> 14:16.865
Half-face white boy
taking our jobs.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.199
Well, the way I see it,

14:19.232 --> 14:21.502
one man got as much right
to eat as another.

14:23.534 --> 14:26.405
And this here man
a friend of mine.

14:28.406 --> 14:30.037
Mr. Harrow.

14:36.983 --> 14:38.686
Mr. White.

14:38.719 --> 14:42.425
You need something,
you look me up.

14:50.162 --> 14:53.972
Tonight, over at UNIA.

14:55.077 --> 14:57.645
We wait till after dark.

14:57.710 --> 15:01.914
Ain't nobody gonna be there
but Narcisse and his men.

15:01.947 --> 15:05.251
So he's running, being chased

15:05.284 --> 15:08.356
through these giant flowerpots,

15:08.389 --> 15:11.924
and he's jumping and
bouncing in and out

15:11.957 --> 15:13.988
like he's got springs
in his shoes.

15:14.029 --> 15:16.060
- ( Giggles )
- What? Who was?

15:16.093 --> 15:18.364
Douglas Fairbanks.
Ain't you listening?

15:18.397 --> 15:20.428
Hey, Nuck,

15:20.468 --> 15:23.332
you see "The Thief of Bagdad"?

15:24.637 --> 15:26.267
You've got time to
go to the pictures?

15:26.340 --> 15:28.539
No.

15:28.571 --> 15:31.168
Just, you know.

15:32.305 --> 15:33.744
I need you to take some men,

15:33.777 --> 15:35.243
head out to the
White Horse Pike.

15:35.276 --> 15:36.683
Mickey: What's out there?

15:36.716 --> 15:39.450
A convoy of trucks heading
from Tampa to New York.

15:39.483 --> 15:42.185
- You want me to stop it?
- Yes.

15:42.218 --> 15:45.719
And find the heroin Petrucelli's
piggybacking with our rum.

15:45.752 --> 15:47.754
Petrucelli's in
business with Masseria?

15:47.795 --> 15:50.291
Masseria, Luciano, Lansky.

15:50.332 --> 15:52.532
- Jesus.
- This kid, this fucking Luciano.

15:52.565 --> 15:54.925
Should have let me plug him years
ago when I had the chance.

15:54.949 --> 15:56.971
First, let's make
sure it's true.

15:57.005 --> 15:59.203
Bring Knox and a
couple of his men.

15:59.268 --> 16:01.835
Flash some tin, less
likely to get messy.

16:01.876 --> 16:03.876
Just get it done.

16:14.455 --> 16:16.559
Ralph: You take
everything north of 22nd.

16:16.592 --> 16:20.032
That's 84 speaks in total.

16:20.065 --> 16:22.863
Up to or including Madison?

16:22.928 --> 16:24.903
( Sniffling ) Include it.

16:24.936 --> 16:27.399
Let Hymie Weiss try and
tell you otherwise.

16:28.969 --> 16:31.408
Johnny, hey. Thought
you'd gone already.

16:31.441 --> 16:34.144
- Who's this?
- George.

16:34.177 --> 16:36.257
From the flower shop. I told
you about him, didn't I?

16:36.281 --> 16:37.877
No.

16:37.911 --> 16:40.582
Sir, he helped us arrange
O'Banion's retirement party.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.445
No, that was a
disgruntled customer.

16:42.486 --> 16:44.254
Half a fin for a dozen roses...

16:44.319 --> 16:46.391
You get 'em home, they're
already wilting.

16:46.424 --> 16:48.758
Drive any fella to murder.
( laughs )

16:48.792 --> 16:50.752
George here's gonna be
taking over my collections.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.207
Yeah, I'm moving Ralphie up.

16:52.248 --> 16:53.591
Oh, you are?

16:53.664 --> 16:55.924
So's I can run the
distribution more hands-on.

16:55.965 --> 16:58.101
And what'll I be doing?

16:58.134 --> 16:59.500
Come again?

16:59.533 --> 17:01.762
While your hands are
on the distribution,

17:01.803 --> 17:03.602
what will I be doing?

17:03.635 --> 17:05.803
Whatever you want. I mean,

17:05.836 --> 17:07.906
I ain't gonna squeeze
you out or nothing.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.137
You wouldn't squeeze me
out of my own operation?

17:10.170 --> 17:12.806
- That is very generous of you.
- You know what I mean.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.108
I mean, I know you
like to relax.

17:15.142 --> 17:17.078
I got people coming
up behind me.

17:17.111 --> 17:20.015
They're, what do you
call it, ambitious.

17:20.048 --> 17:22.519
I've been meaning to talk
to you about this anyway.

17:22.551 --> 17:23.750
So talk.

17:23.782 --> 17:25.915
( Sniffles )

17:28.221 --> 17:31.254
We had discussions, you
and me, about the future

17:31.294 --> 17:33.991
when you got back from Italy.

17:34.032 --> 17:36.661
Expanding my role
when you retire.

17:36.694 --> 17:39.099
But I ain't retiring, Al.

17:40.029 --> 17:41.565
No.

17:41.598 --> 17:43.734
Right.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.472
Of course.

17:45.505 --> 17:47.642
I know that.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.682
Someday. Eventually.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.788
I'm gonna go. It's good
you're thinking ahead.

18:00.799 --> 18:03.997
( Chattering )

18:04.030 --> 18:05.765
I remind you all once again

18:05.798 --> 18:08.363
that our other business
must be kept far away...

18:08.404 --> 18:09.898
Doctor.

18:09.931 --> 18:12.307
- Man: Watch out!
- ( people screaming )

18:12.340 --> 18:14.806
Man: Get down! Get down!

18:30.359 --> 18:32.059
Come on, let's go.

18:37.302 --> 18:39.070
Chalky...

18:41.504 --> 18:44.436
- Go! Go!
- ( engine revving )

18:47.511 --> 18:51.115
- ( gun clicks )
- ( growling )

19:00.225 --> 19:02.331
C. Auguste Dupin.

19:02.364 --> 19:05.099
I don't know him.

19:05.132 --> 19:08.127
He's fictional. A detective.

19:08.168 --> 19:10.800
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue."

19:10.833 --> 19:12.635
Right.

19:12.708 --> 19:16.513
Those stories are the reason I
wanted to join law enforcement.

19:18.352 --> 19:20.486
You've handled yourself well.

19:20.519 --> 19:22.752
I'm sure you were a good cop.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.766
Are we friends now?

19:31.332 --> 19:33.234
Dinner bell.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.945
You don't have to
be my pal, Eli.

19:37.978 --> 19:40.546
I mean, heck, I don't
even think you like me.

19:40.587 --> 19:43.720
But really, this doesn't
have to be so bad.

19:47.424 --> 19:51.260
- ( Overlapping voices ) Okay, fellas.
- ( chatter )

19:51.293 --> 19:53.628
- Fan it out. Let's go.
- All right.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.236
- Man: Hold up.
- ( engine stops )

20:00.269 --> 20:02.742
Selby: Stay where you are, sir.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.475
Eli, what the fuck is this?

20:06.508 --> 20:08.547
- Knox: Search the trucks.
- Man ♪2: Move!

20:08.580 --> 20:11.411
Since when did you start
riding with the help?

20:11.452 --> 20:14.082
You want to tell me what's transpiring
here? We're already behind.

20:14.115 --> 20:16.481
( Chatter )

20:16.522 --> 20:18.688
It's none of your business
what we got in there.

20:18.721 --> 20:20.920
Is there a problem, Agent Selby?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.427
This wise head won't
get out of the way.

20:27.799 --> 20:30.268
Perhaps you're using
the wrong approach.

20:30.301 --> 20:31.931
Step aside, please.

20:31.972 --> 20:33.172
Tell it to Joe the boss.

20:33.205 --> 20:35.909
Why don't you relay
the message instead?

20:35.942 --> 20:39.446
( Men shouting )

20:40.751 --> 20:42.379
Any other objections?

20:43.411 --> 20:45.147
Man ♪3: No, sir. No, sir.

20:45.180 --> 20:46.684
All right, all right. All right.

20:46.717 --> 20:49.256
Open up. Open up.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.097
Was that necessary?

20:52.130 --> 20:54.192
You heard the man.
They're already behind.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.726
Take your time, by all means.

20:56.767 --> 20:59.504
And before this gets any
further out of hand,

20:59.569 --> 21:00.947
please tell me how I
can be of assistance.

21:00.971 --> 21:02.691
We understand you're
carrying more than rum.

21:02.715 --> 21:05.076
If we are, that's beyond any
personal knowledge I have

21:05.141 --> 21:06.843
- of the situation.
- ( whistles )

21:18.265 --> 21:21.327
( music playing )

21:22.496 --> 21:24.537
( music continues )

21:32.609 --> 21:34.681
( knocking )

21:36.683 --> 21:38.188
Dr. Narcisse.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.660
Chalky White.

21:42.693 --> 21:44.657
Sid: I told him he
wasn't here, boss.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.362
You don't tell Dr.
Narcisse anything.

21:47.395 --> 21:50.397
He's not.

21:50.430 --> 21:52.799
Now you've heard
it from me, so...

21:52.840 --> 21:55.038
He came at me. I want him dead.

21:55.071 --> 21:57.404
- Came at you how?
- With a pistol.

21:57.437 --> 22:00.373
He and his men killed
three of mine.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.183
- This happened tonight?
- And tonight it ends.

22:03.216 --> 22:05.018
What you yourself began.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.049
Dead!

22:07.090 --> 22:09.119
I will cut him from
nave to chaps.

22:10.351 --> 22:12.956
You'll find the
meat tough, Doctor.

22:16.194 --> 22:19.464
Tell me where he is or don't.

22:19.497 --> 22:21.368
Your choice.

22:21.401 --> 22:24.631
Dr. Narcisse,

22:24.672 --> 22:27.502
there's something I've
been meaning to ask you

22:27.535 --> 22:29.838
for quite some time.

22:31.911 --> 22:34.343
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

22:34.376 --> 22:36.144
( Growls )

22:40.618 --> 22:43.153
Cast your lot? Is it so?

22:45.089 --> 22:48.222
Your leaving on your
feet or on your back

22:48.255 --> 22:50.462
is entirely up to you.

22:50.495 --> 22:53.231
So don't make a mistake.

22:54.464 --> 22:56.767
- You ready for this?
- Just say.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.405
I'll put one in this
burrhead right now.

22:59.438 --> 23:03.741
Mr. Thompson, he not
ready for this.

23:03.774 --> 23:07.478
Don't be so sure.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.279
I told you, I don't
know where Chalky is.

23:10.312 --> 23:12.646
You've got problems with him,

23:12.679 --> 23:15.347
take it up with him.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.786
Now get the fuck out of my club.

23:20.154 --> 23:22.289
When I run him through,

23:22.323 --> 23:24.857
watch the light go out,

23:24.890 --> 23:28.796
I hope he knows what a
friend he had in you.

23:43.946 --> 23:46.082
You sure this copacetic?

23:46.115 --> 23:48.314
I ain't never fought
no war but my own.

23:48.347 --> 23:49.945
They're painting
the Legion hall.

23:49.984 --> 23:52.879
You'll be safe here
through the weekend.

23:54.616 --> 23:56.623
Went straight through.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.591
How you know that?

24:00.624 --> 24:03.560
I've been around many people

24:03.593 --> 24:05.864
who've been shot.

24:05.897 --> 24:08.233
( Knocking )

24:16.612 --> 24:19.010
It's your friend.

24:23.986 --> 24:25.985
Oh, my God.

24:26.018 --> 24:27.953
What did he do?

24:29.954 --> 24:32.561
De-Ernie: Brought her directly, Mr.
White.

24:36.932 --> 24:38.699
Ain't nobody follow y'all?

24:46.106 --> 24:47.241
( Groans )

24:47.274 --> 24:50.177
You go on now. Make
the midnight show

24:50.210 --> 24:52.081
so they ain't suspicious.

24:52.114 --> 24:53.178
Yes, sir.

24:53.211 --> 24:55.482
You go, too.

24:55.515 --> 24:57.515
I'll be fine.

25:11.929 --> 25:14.093
He'll come after you, you know.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.199
Come after us.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.369
Let him come.

25:21.211 --> 25:23.746
Can you even raise your arm?

25:35.519 --> 25:37.621
( Water dripping )

25:40.389 --> 25:42.991
( man and woman shouting )

25:45.999 --> 25:49.331
- ( clank )
- ( woman screaming )

25:49.364 --> 25:52.393
- ( baby crying )
- ( argument continues )

25:55.134 --> 25:56.342
( man's voice fades )

25:56.375 --> 25:59.008
- ( door slams )
- ( baby crying )

25:59.041 --> 26:01.446
- ( women laughing )
- ( dogs barking )

26:06.317 --> 26:09.253
( seagulls screeching )

26:09.286 --> 26:11.053
You come to me
practically begging,

26:11.086 --> 26:13.123
some wet-behind-the-ears
little shit.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.547
Nucky...

26:14.571 --> 26:15.995
You assure me your
intentions are honorable,

26:16.019 --> 26:18.219
that you and your partner have
big plans for the future.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.692
- If you'd just let me speak...
- I let you in on the deal.

26:20.733 --> 26:22.531
Things are going great

26:22.564 --> 26:24.484
and what do you do the
second you get the chance?

26:24.508 --> 26:26.803
- Mr. Thompson...
- You stick it up my fucking ass.

26:26.844 --> 26:28.803
We were coerced, Charlie and I.

26:28.836 --> 26:31.006
By Masseria.

26:31.039 --> 26:32.719
He found out about Tampa
from his cousin...

26:32.743 --> 26:33.771
Petrucelli.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.684
Then realized he could
use it to his advantage.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.236
As did you and your
greaseball partner.

26:37.269 --> 26:39.069
He would have killed us
if we didn't go along.

26:39.093 --> 26:40.628
You think I fucking won't?

26:43.243 --> 26:45.011
I know that is a
distinct possibility,

26:45.044 --> 26:48.007
though I do pray to God
it doesn't happen.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.543
If it were strictly
up to me, sir,

26:51.584 --> 26:53.214
I'd have nothing to
do with narcotics.

26:53.247 --> 26:56.244
There is plenty of money in
liquor, which is a much safer

26:56.285 --> 26:59.716
and eminently more
socially acceptable...

26:59.749 --> 27:01.389
You've got two seconds
to drop the fucking

27:01.413 --> 27:04.322
Boy Scout routine or
you're going in that hole.

27:04.355 --> 27:06.624
( Sobbing )

27:08.087 --> 27:11.818
There's a fortune to
be made in heroin.

27:14.290 --> 27:17.491
Millions and
millions of dollars.

27:21.065 --> 27:23.158
Now I don't know about you,

27:23.231 --> 27:26.460
but the way I saw it, it was the
same life I was risking either way.

27:27.933 --> 27:30.900
I'm begging you, Mr.
Thompson. Please.

27:30.963 --> 27:33.030
What would you have
done if you were me?

27:41.437 --> 27:43.803
- You're going to call him.
- Call who?

27:43.836 --> 27:46.472
Masseria. If he'd
like to see you

27:46.505 --> 27:49.208
or his heroin ever again,

27:49.241 --> 27:51.608
tell him to get his
ass down here.

27:57.311 --> 27:59.548
( Exhales )

28:01.383 --> 28:03.055
Sid: Chalky White
left a message.

28:03.088 --> 28:04.919
Says it's urgent.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.756
You're set for 2:00
with the Palm Court.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.862
Mr. Murphy is running
five minutes late.

28:12.895 --> 28:15.936
Remind me to stick
it to him later.

28:16.001 --> 28:17.937
And do me a favor.

28:17.970 --> 28:20.702
Make sure these trade
confirmations get filed.

28:20.735 --> 28:22.772
Anaconda Realty?

28:22.805 --> 28:25.774
Redstone, some of
these other dubs,

28:25.807 --> 28:28.575
they're down by 80%.

28:28.616 --> 28:30.750
I'll tell you, they say
these kikes are smart.

28:30.783 --> 28:33.645
Well, this one's
dumb as a doornail

28:33.686 --> 28:36.254
with the deepest pockets
I've ever seen.

28:36.287 --> 28:38.023
They're no match for you, sir.

28:38.056 --> 28:40.854
They're greedy, every
last one of them.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.293
Redstone included.

28:43.326 --> 28:46.195
Thinks he can get rich
without doing a thing.

28:46.229 --> 28:48.197
Well, the more fool him.

28:48.230 --> 28:52.272
I'd like to take the new
Duesenberg for a test drive.

28:52.305 --> 28:55.468
There's a number for a
salesman on my desk somewhere.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.202
Consider it done.

28:57.235 --> 29:00.205
That's what Valentino
drives, you know.

29:00.246 --> 29:02.247
Oh.

29:20.431 --> 29:22.368
It's warm,

29:22.433 --> 29:24.603
but it's all I can find.

29:25.677 --> 29:27.977
They keep the rest locked up.

29:28.042 --> 29:29.872
It's fine, thank you.

29:31.115 --> 29:34.149
How we get to Narcisse?

29:36.256 --> 29:38.625
May we have some
privacy, please?

29:42.191 --> 29:44.128
Of course.

29:54.175 --> 29:56.541
Are you thinking straight
about any of this?

29:56.574 --> 29:59.175
She put the knife
in Purnsley back.

30:02.248 --> 30:06.382
He came to see me last night.
Narcisse.

30:06.455 --> 30:08.856
- What he offer?
- It doesn't matter.

30:08.889 --> 30:11.122
But what he wants
is you on a slab.

30:11.163 --> 30:13.258
What you want?

30:13.299 --> 30:14.826
I can tell you
what I don't want,

30:14.867 --> 30:16.531
and that's a fucking war.

30:22.635 --> 30:24.641
You okay?

30:27.809 --> 30:29.775
Been worse.

30:29.808 --> 30:31.880
You've been better, too.

30:33.746 --> 30:38.091
So push come to shove,

30:38.124 --> 30:40.261
what happen then?

30:40.294 --> 30:42.895
I'm here, aren't I?

30:42.928 --> 30:45.732
You said you ain't want no war.

30:45.765 --> 30:47.500
I don't want the trots either,

30:47.533 --> 30:49.068
but when I get them,
I deal with it.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.977
You know, someone once told me

30:55.010 --> 30:57.741
all of man's problems
come from his inability

30:57.775 --> 31:00.578
to just sit in a room.

31:02.316 --> 31:04.348
Doing that right now.

31:04.381 --> 31:07.520
Then I suppose your
troubles are over.

31:28.271 --> 31:31.449
Don't do anything until
you hear from me.

31:34.020 --> 31:36.249
Bader: and as a devoted friend

31:36.282 --> 31:38.785
of the good and decent
people of the Northside,

31:38.818 --> 31:40.521
I vow this...

31:40.554 --> 31:43.692
Neither I nor the members
of the sheriff's department

31:43.732 --> 31:47.468
will rest until every last one
of the cowardly perpetrators

31:47.501 --> 31:50.637
of this heinous attack
are brought to justice.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.037
Thank you.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.237
- ( Reporters clamoring )
- Mr. Mayor, is it true

31:54.278 --> 31:56.940
Chalky White is being
sought for questioning?

31:56.973 --> 31:59.578
Mr. Mayor, will the city
rebuild the UNIA office?

31:59.611 --> 32:01.546
( Reporters continue shouting )

32:12.153 --> 32:13.752
Man: Harry, help
me with this lamp.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.485
Harry: All right, got it.

32:19.326 --> 32:22.360
Ah, Nucky Thompson.

32:22.401 --> 32:24.137
Always a pleasure.

32:24.170 --> 32:27.001
- Perhaps for you.
- ( Masseria laughs )

32:27.074 --> 32:29.810
Things look different
during the day, no?

32:29.843 --> 32:31.875
You see all the...

32:31.908 --> 32:33.309
How you say?

32:33.350 --> 32:35.444
The flaws.

32:37.484 --> 32:40.085
I've always preferred
bringing things to light.

32:42.791 --> 32:46.431
Meyer, now why you so blue?

32:46.464 --> 32:49.532
It could have something to do with
the heroin you had him import.

32:49.565 --> 32:53.439
Ah, si. He mention this
to me when he called.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.506
So what do you have
to say for yourself?

32:56.579 --> 33:01.238
We wait, huh?

33:01.279 --> 33:03.414
What partner?

33:07.751 --> 33:09.350
Forgive me my tardiness.

33:09.383 --> 33:11.250
It is a quality I
deplore in others.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.913
Ah, no. We just get started.

33:21.359 --> 33:23.955
What the hell is going on?

33:23.988 --> 33:26.220
The world is going on, Mr.
Thompson.

33:26.261 --> 33:29.365
Without you, depending on
what passes here today.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.164
You two are partners?

33:31.197 --> 33:33.898
In a manner of speaking, yes.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.965
As you've deduced, I
am deeply entrenched

33:38.030 --> 33:39.797
in the business of
providing heroin

33:39.830 --> 33:41.702
to those wretched
souls who desire it.

33:41.735 --> 33:45.102
Mr. Masseria and I have recently
embarked on an arrangement

33:45.135 --> 33:49.342
wherein he will supply me
with product via Tampa.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.015
Using my trucks for delivery.

33:55.048 --> 33:59.153
- So you see.
- We do business already, the three of us.

33:59.186 --> 34:01.690
And if I don't like it?

34:01.723 --> 34:03.243
Narcisse: I should
paint you a picture,

34:03.267 --> 34:06.189
but I assure you it
would not be pretty.

34:06.222 --> 34:09.226
There is money to be made, Mr.
Thompson.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.491
A very great deal of it.

34:11.524 --> 34:13.500
I will not be your friend,

34:13.533 --> 34:15.563
but I will be an able partner.

34:15.597 --> 34:18.772
One far more dependable than
you've ever had before.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.342
- Just like that?
- No.

34:21.376 --> 34:25.509
I will require your full
support on the Northside

34:25.543 --> 34:28.580
to include you delivering your Mr.
White

34:28.614 --> 34:31.045
to me personally.

34:31.085 --> 34:33.118
This is nonnegotiable.

34:33.150 --> 34:35.851
What do I get?

34:35.885 --> 34:38.217
What do you want?

34:40.784 --> 34:43.824
For starters, I want
my fucking share.

34:45.193 --> 34:48.527
One third of any heroin
already imported.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.230
And one third of any
imported in the future.

34:57.103 --> 35:00.437
So we have struck
a bargain, then?

35:04.406 --> 35:05.745
Yes.

35:07.176 --> 35:10.215
You will not be sorry, Mr.
Thompson.

35:10.248 --> 35:13.453
I see great days ahead.

35:24.329 --> 35:26.935
Woman: The mayor will be right
with you, Mr. Thompson.

35:32.603 --> 35:36.035
- Anything from Knox?
- Can't find him.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.403
Woman: Please hold
for Mayor Bader.

35:38.444 --> 35:41.179
- Bader: Hello?
- Ed, it's me.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.347
- Nucky.
- Listen to me clearly.

35:44.412 --> 35:45.915
This is an emergency.

35:45.948 --> 35:47.619
I need you to send two
sheriff's deputies

35:47.652 --> 35:49.786
to get Chalky White out of town.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.388
Okay.

35:53.421 --> 35:56.327
( laughter )

35:56.360 --> 35:59.067
Fella goes to a drugstore
to buy rubbers.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.634
The guy goes, "You
want a bag with that?"

36:01.667 --> 36:04.610
Fella says, "No, thanks,
she ain't that ugly."

36:04.643 --> 36:08.211
( laughing )

36:08.276 --> 36:12.011
How do you make your wife
scream while you're having sex?

36:12.084 --> 36:13.620
Call her, tell her about it.

36:13.653 --> 36:15.055
( laughing )

36:15.088 --> 36:16.320
Torrio: All right.

36:18.456 --> 36:21.091
All right, I'm heading out.

36:21.124 --> 36:23.225
Johnny, stay. Have a drink.

36:23.258 --> 36:26.530
I'll catch your matinee
performance tomorrow.

36:30.468 --> 36:32.331
Another round.

36:32.404 --> 36:34.571
- What's that called?
- Tom Collins.

36:34.604 --> 36:36.172
- I'll kill that bum.
- Oh.

36:36.205 --> 36:38.004
( Phone ringing )

36:38.045 --> 36:40.644
What's a good bar and a
good woman have in common?

36:40.677 --> 36:41.947
Al: I don't know.

36:41.980 --> 36:44.714
Liquor in the front,
poker in the back.

36:44.747 --> 36:47.185
( laughing )

36:47.218 --> 36:49.184
You've never...?

36:49.217 --> 36:50.519
Al, you got a call.

36:50.552 --> 36:51.686
( Snorting ) Who is it?

36:51.719 --> 36:54.149
- He didn't say.
- Take a message.

36:54.182 --> 36:55.349
Said it's important.

36:55.390 --> 36:58.189
I'll take it in there. Come on.

37:05.198 --> 37:07.797
( Sniffling )

37:07.830 --> 37:09.965
- Hello.
- Man: This Al?

37:09.998 --> 37:12.806
- ( Gasps, laughs )
- Yeah, who's this?

37:12.839 --> 37:14.438
Man: Never mind who it is.

37:14.471 --> 37:16.111
Yeah? Then what the
fuck do you want?

37:16.144 --> 37:19.647
Man: Nothing. I was just
calling to say good-bye.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.512
Al: Huh?

37:25.753 --> 37:27.486
Down! Get down!

37:31.788 --> 37:34.954
( Screaming )

37:47.892 --> 37:50.628
( screaming )

37:56.064 --> 37:58.965
( women screaming, crying )

38:00.238 --> 38:02.408
Ralph! Ralphie!

38:02.441 --> 38:04.040
You okay?

38:06.082 --> 38:07.481
Ralph: I'm all right.

38:07.514 --> 38:10.546
Oh, my God!

38:10.587 --> 38:12.282
Sweet, merciful Jesus.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.051
Oh, my God.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.088
- ( Crying )
- Man: Come on, come on.

38:27.631 --> 38:31.596
Well, lucky for John he
left when he did, huh?

38:32.934 --> 38:34.838
Huh?

38:35.976 --> 38:37.975
You okay?

38:38.008 --> 38:39.238
( Blows nose )

38:41.615 --> 38:43.512
Are you sure I can't offer
you something else?

38:43.545 --> 38:45.986
I'm fine, thank you. Please.

38:56.466 --> 38:59.364
( Sighs ) I'm too
nervous to eat.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.804
You needn't worry.
I'm a married man.

39:01.837 --> 39:04.673
You must be joking.

39:05.705 --> 39:07.272
I am.

39:08.842 --> 39:12.116
Though what would Mr.
Thompson think?

39:12.149 --> 39:14.747
He can think what he wants.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.417
My life is my own.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.584
Not that this is that.

39:19.617 --> 39:20.887
This is business.

39:20.920 --> 39:24.685
Drink your tea. It
settles the nerves.

39:27.694 --> 39:29.790
It's impossible to get ahead.

39:29.823 --> 39:32.162
And believe me, I've tried.

39:32.202 --> 39:34.268
I work hard, I save my...

39:34.301 --> 39:37.037
You owe no one any
explanations, Miss Rohan.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.013
Mr. Bennett...

39:44.046 --> 39:47.457
Mr. Bennett is a criminal
no different than...

39:48.923 --> 39:50.226
Than me?

39:51.395 --> 39:53.425
I was going to say my husband.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.463
Though to be fair,

39:57.496 --> 39:59.896
one could paint me
with that same brush.

40:11.483 --> 40:13.546
Anaconda Realty.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.786
Mr. Bennett and his
partners own the company.

40:15.819 --> 40:18.955
He bought more shares
this afternoon.

40:18.988 --> 40:21.789
You should do so yourself
as soon as possible.

40:21.830 --> 40:24.030
30,000 shares preferred stock.

40:24.064 --> 40:25.895
You shouldn't sell
until he does.

40:25.936 --> 40:28.333
I'll let you know
when that happens.

40:28.366 --> 40:30.930
In return for what?

40:38.177 --> 40:39.912
A rent-free apartment

40:39.945 --> 40:42.317
guaranteed for five years.

40:42.350 --> 40:44.245
A safe neighborhood

40:44.286 --> 40:46.950
with rooms for the children.

40:50.891 --> 40:52.963
You'll accept nothing from Mr.
Thompson,

40:52.996 --> 40:55.035
yet you will from me?

40:56.500 --> 40:59.170
I earned this.

40:59.203 --> 41:02.442
And when it's over,
I owe you nothing.

41:08.043 --> 41:09.778
We have a deal.

41:11.747 --> 41:13.682
Very well.

41:20.628 --> 41:23.594
I've never done business
with a woman before.

41:23.627 --> 41:26.796
Well, how did you like it?

41:28.438 --> 41:30.503
Quite the treat.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.818
You got peoples anywhere?

41:42.851 --> 41:45.188
Just here in this room.

41:45.228 --> 41:46.996
You?

41:49.198 --> 41:52.197
You stay here,
wait till morning.

41:52.230 --> 41:54.638
Catch a train out west.

41:54.671 --> 41:56.606
You'll be safe there.

41:59.745 --> 42:02.415
I'm going wherever you go.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.918
( Cars approaching )

42:08.614 --> 42:10.885
They're here.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.027
Mr. White? Climb in the back.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.059
Crouch down a little.

42:25.797 --> 42:27.438
Uncle Nucky.

42:27.471 --> 42:28.973
Will, what are you doing here?

42:29.006 --> 42:31.508
I tried to call.
The line was busy.

42:31.541 --> 42:34.443
Want a drink?

42:34.476 --> 42:36.740
What's wrong?

42:36.781 --> 42:39.045
Earlier today the mayor
gave a press conference.

42:39.079 --> 42:41.348
I saw the afternoon paper.

42:41.381 --> 42:43.313
Well, afterwards
he had a meeting.

42:43.346 --> 42:45.647
This colored doctor
from the Northside.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.122
- Narcisse?
- I don't know.

42:48.155 --> 42:49.755
He had a beard. Suit
cost more than...

42:49.788 --> 42:51.989
- What did they talk about?
- I couldn't hear,

42:52.029 --> 42:55.427
but they were in Bader's
office for over an hour.

43:02.130 --> 43:04.801
Get me the American

43:29.530 --> 43:31.896
Missed the turnoff back there.

43:31.929 --> 43:34.197
That right?

43:34.230 --> 43:36.894
Doing some work on that road.

43:52.585 --> 43:54.281
Hurt a touch.

43:54.322 --> 43:57.687
You'll feel better
with some sleep.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.958
Maybe I'll close
my eyes a while.

44:28.956 --> 44:32.258

- Daughter: No!

44:32.291 --> 44:33.657

44:33.690 --> 44:35.160
Oh, damn!

44:37.298 --> 44:39.732

- Chalky: Steer the car!

44:56.148 --> 44:57.220
( Neck snaps )

45:01.821 --> 45:04.059
( panting )

45:27.918 --> 45:29.980
Chalky: Help me get him out.

45:39.059 --> 45:41.534
Agent P-138: Carnegie
Hall, one month ago.

45:41.566 --> 45:44.431
Nearly 3,000 Negroes in
attendance to see Garvey.

45:44.472 --> 45:48.131
If anything, his arrest has
made him more popular.

45:48.172 --> 45:50.805
Man to his left, that Patterson?

45:50.838 --> 45:52.511
Yes, sir.

45:52.544 --> 45:55.048
We can't get any more
inside than him.

45:55.082 --> 45:56.746
Pathetic, isn't it?

45:56.787 --> 45:58.752
They join his club,

45:58.785 --> 46:00.814
attend his mandatory outings.

46:00.847 --> 46:04.289
In exchange, he sells them
uniforms signifying nothing,

46:04.322 --> 46:07.059
with the profits being
used to fund his appeal.

46:07.093 --> 46:09.629
That man has done more
damage free on bail

46:09.670 --> 46:12.034
than most criminals
achieve in a lifetime.

46:12.067 --> 46:14.968
3,000 Negroes with ideas
in their heads...

46:15.001 --> 46:17.002
That's a threat worth
worrying about.

46:26.977 --> 46:28.714
Your tail's wagging, Jim.

46:28.747 --> 46:31.021
I got our weak link.

46:31.054 --> 46:32.988
Nucky Thompson...

46:33.053 --> 46:34.890
His brother Eli.

46:34.923 --> 46:38.120
We backed him into a corner.

46:38.153 --> 46:40.793
He's going to connect all
the dots for us, Edgar.

46:40.826 --> 46:42.396
Our man in Harlem.

46:42.429 --> 46:44.069
I may need you from time to time

46:44.103 --> 46:45.966
to nourish that relationship.

46:46.007 --> 46:48.139
Yes, Mr. Director.

46:52.772 --> 46:54.843
What is this?

46:54.876 --> 46:56.945
I'm late for a debriefing.

46:56.979 --> 46:59.279
Yes, of course, sir.

47:01.016 --> 47:04.049
( Music playing )

47:06.453 --> 47:08.619
Since when are you so shy?

47:09.827 --> 47:12.024
This isn't the
right place to be.

47:12.057 --> 47:15.194
Do you just want to
sit at home moping?

47:15.227 --> 47:17.267
What do you have to
be so happy about?

47:17.300 --> 47:20.497
Tonight? Nothing at all.

47:20.570 --> 47:22.032
That's why we're here.

47:22.104 --> 47:23.831
Boardwalk Slim.

47:23.872 --> 47:26.639
We just commencing. ( laughs )

47:28.040 --> 47:30.344
Sit anywhere you want.

47:30.377 --> 47:32.640
We're allowed to?

47:32.681 --> 47:34.976
After hours.

47:35.016 --> 47:37.182
It's all just us here.

47:42.385 --> 47:45.089
Go on. That's what
you came here for.

I'm sorry.

48:44.919 --> 48:47.380
Just lying down for a minute.

48:47.413 --> 48:48.716
No need to apologize.

48:48.749 --> 48:51.556
It's an intoxicating brew...

48:51.589 --> 48:54.622
The music, the
smoke, the alcohol.

48:54.655 --> 48:57.295
I haven't had anything.

48:57.328 --> 48:59.000
What's stopping you?

49:00.433 --> 49:02.535
Not in the mood, I suppose.

49:02.568 --> 49:05.566
At times, it seems all there is

49:05.599 --> 49:08.604
is us and our unhappiness.

49:10.209 --> 49:12.547
This is one of those times.

49:14.148 --> 49:16.217
Sit. Please.

49:22.055 --> 49:23.856
You're not with the musicians.

49:23.889 --> 49:25.994
No.

49:26.059 --> 49:28.864
I came with my brother.

49:28.897 --> 49:32.297
That's him playing with Mr.
Coates.

49:43.872 --> 49:46.451
You are Mr. White's child?

49:46.484 --> 49:48.422
You know him?

49:48.455 --> 49:51.522
We are intimately associated.

49:51.587 --> 49:53.551
Richard Pastor.

49:53.616 --> 49:57.054
Maybelle White.

49:57.088 --> 49:59.330
No wonder he's so proud.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.460
Do you know where he is?

50:02.395 --> 50:04.599
Alas, no.

50:04.632 --> 50:08.132
I've heard the rumors,

50:08.165 --> 50:09.500
the lies.

50:09.533 --> 50:11.470
And beneath it all,

50:11.503 --> 50:13.473
the old drumbeat of injustice.

50:13.506 --> 50:16.106
Mother won't even
get out of bed.

50:16.147 --> 50:19.345
And you are to be
married, are you not?

50:22.083 --> 50:24.419
Not as of 3:00 this afternoon.

50:24.452 --> 50:26.785
Samuel wasn't even there.

50:26.850 --> 50:30.456
His father told me. I
think he enjoyed it.

50:30.489 --> 50:33.563
Why must it be the
daughters who suffer?

50:33.596 --> 50:37.134
That's the funny thing.
I'm not suffering.

50:38.470 --> 50:40.435
I'm...

50:40.468 --> 50:42.832
I don't know what I am.

50:42.865 --> 50:45.106
Except something I'm
not supposed to be.

50:45.139 --> 50:47.212
Dangerous...

50:48.550 --> 50:50.948
for people like us.

50:50.981 --> 50:52.653
Like us?

51:00.466 --> 51:02.395
To be what we are,

51:02.436 --> 51:04.100
where we are,

51:04.133 --> 51:06.835
and dare to stand free,

51:06.868 --> 51:09.940
what could be more lonely?

51:17.018 --> 51:19.553
I was supposed to come
here to forget things.

51:19.586 --> 51:21.122
( Tisks )

51:24.366 --> 51:26.535
Then go

51:26.568 --> 51:28.809
and forget.

52:08.042 --> 52:09.211
What the fuck's going on?

52:09.252 --> 52:10.892
You've got the Seventh
Regiment out there.

52:10.916 --> 52:13.226
Bader's turned. He's
in Narcisse's pocket.

52:13.259 --> 52:14.427
What?

52:15.996 --> 52:17.161
You reach anyone yet?

52:17.194 --> 52:19.000
He's locked inside his office

52:19.033 --> 52:20.367
preparing a statement.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.600
Word is two deputies
are dead on the Pike.

52:23.633 --> 52:25.568
Why are you here?

52:25.601 --> 52:27.408
Nucky: He's doing his job, Eli.

52:27.441 --> 52:29.807
Why else would I put
him next to Bader?

52:32.373 --> 52:34.373
You need to leave this room.

52:34.406 --> 52:37.045
He's already heard it all.

52:44.851 --> 52:47.050
This is the life you want?

52:48.419 --> 52:52.323
Pop, isn't it what we do?

53:02.605 --> 53:04.910
All right.
