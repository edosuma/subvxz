46:33.889 --> 46:35.555
THERE'S NO BLOOD. THEN...

46:35.639 --> 46:38.764
Reporter 1 (on TV):
RED HATS ARE BEING
WORN WITH PRIDE

46:38.847 --> 46:41.931
OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER
HOURS AFTER THE BUSINESSMAN

46:42.013 --> 46:44.097
BECAME THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.

46:44.180 --> 46:45.847
NOW I CAN WEAR MY HAT.

46:45.931 --> 46:47.764
NO ONE'S GONNA
THROW ROCKS AT ME.

46:47.847 --> 46:49.472
Reporter 1:
EVEN THOUGH NEW YORK WENT BLUE,

46:49.555 --> 46:51.931
SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS
FEEL MUCH SAFER VOICING

46:52.013 --> 46:54.180
THEIR SUPPORT ON
CITY STREETS TODAY

46:54.263 --> 46:55.472
THAN THEY DID YESTERDAY.

46:55.555 --> 46:57.472
I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE
1:30 IN THE MORNING.

46:57.555 --> 47:00.639
WHEN I SAW IT WAS THAT CLOSE,
I SAID, I HAVE TO
WITNESS HISTORY.

47:00.722 --> 47:03.222
Reporter 1:
PRIDE CONTRASTING A HUMBLENESS

47:03.305 --> 47:05.222
THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN
MANAGER SAYS

47:05.305 --> 47:08.722
OUR PRESIDENT-ELECT IS
DEMONSTRATING IN PRIVATE
TODAY.

47:08.806 --> 47:10.514
-(phone buzzing)
-BEING PRESIDENT IS HUMBLING

47:10.597 --> 47:14.138
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
THE TASK OF UNIFYING
A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY.

47:14.222 --> 47:16.722
YOU'VE GOT THE TASK
OF TACKLING SO MANY
OF OUR PROBLEMS

47:16.806 --> 47:18.430
DOMESTICALLY
AND INTERNATIONALLY.

47:18.514 --> 47:20.806
-IT'S A BIG, BIG LOAD
THAT HE'S INHERITING.
-(buzzing continues)

47:20.889 --> 47:23.305
Reporter 1:
BUT PROTESTERS WHO LINED UP
IN THE RAIN THIS MORNING

47:23.389 --> 47:26.305
SAY UNIFYING UNDER
A TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS A--

47:26.389 --> 47:29.514
-Woman 1: I MISSED
A LITTLE DETAIL--
-Woman 2: LIKE, UH, EITHER--

47:29.597 --> 47:32.514
Reporter 2: TONIGHT,
"NIGHTLY NEWS" CONTINUES
NOW WITH ANOTHER HALF-HOUR

47:32.597 --> 47:34.722
OF COVERAGE ON
MOST OF OUR STATIONS.

47:34.806 --> 47:38.180
FOR OTHERS, IT WILL BE
STREAMED LIVE ON OUR WEBSITE.

47:38.263 --> 47:40.514
-(news theme playing)
-WE'RE BACK NOW

47:40.597 --> 47:43.222
-WITH MORE OF OUR CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF DONALD TRUMP'S
-(buzzing)

47:43.305 --> 47:46.514
STUNNING UPSET VICTORY TO
MAKE HIM THE 45TH PRESIDENT

47:46.597 --> 47:48.138
-OF THE UNITED STATES,
-(clears throat)

47:48.222 --> 47:51.013
ONE OF THE MOST IMPROBABLE
AND INCREDIBLE ELECTION DRAMAS

47:51.097 --> 47:52.472
-IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
-Yes?

47:52.555 --> 47:54.889
Reporter 2:
IN THE HOURS SINCE
TRUMP CLAIMED VICTORY,

47:54.972 --> 47:57.347
WE'VE LEARNED THE OUTCOME
CAME AS A SHOCK

47:57.430 --> 47:59.806
EVEN TO THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN THEMSELVES.

47:59.889 --> 48:02.514
-HIS RIVAL, HILLARY CLINTON,
PUBLICLY CONCEDING
-Where?

48:02.597 --> 48:04.472
-THE RACE TODAY.
-How many?

48:04.555 --> 48:06.764
IT MAY BE A PAINFUL LOSS
OF THE ELECTORAL VOTE,

48:06.847 --> 48:10.180
EVEN AS SHE HOLDS A NARROW
LEAD IN THE POPULAR VOTE.

48:10.263 --> 48:12.847
WE'VE GOT MUCH MORE ON
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP

48:12.931 --> 48:15.722
AND HOW HIS VICTORY IS
IMPACTING THE COUNTRY,

48:15.806 --> 48:17.847
STARTING WITH NBC'S
PETER ALEXANDER.

48:17.931 --> 48:19.806
Sarah:
Okay. Yeah, I'm coming over.

48:19.889 --> 48:21.472
Peter Alexander:
TONIGHT, A STUNNING
NEW REALITY.

48:21.555 --> 48:23.681
-PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP.
-(door shuts)

48:23.764 --> 48:26.681
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
COMPLICATED BUSINESS.

48:26.764 --> 48:28.347
-COMPLICATED.
-(cheering)

48:28.430 --> 48:31.055
Alexander:
THE GREAT DISRUPTOR PULLING
OFF AN IMPROBABLE TRIUMPH,

48:31.138 --> 48:34.681
THAT EVEN HIS CLOSEST AIDES
SAY THEY DIDN'T SEE COMING.

48:34.764 --> 48:37.889
I SAY IT IS TIME FOR US

48:37.972 --> 48:41.847
TO COME TOGETHER AS
ONE UNITED PEOPLE.

48:41.931 --> 48:44.639
(cheering)

48:44.722 --> 48:46.222
IT'S TIME.

48:46.305 --> 48:48.972
Alexander:
FOR HOURS, AMERICANS WATCHED
IN SUSPENSE AND DISBELIEF

48:49.055 --> 48:51.639
AS TRUMP'S RED STATE
VICTORIES GREW.

48:51.722 --> 48:54.430
INSIDE HILLARY CLINTON'S
HEADQUARTERS, HEARTBREAK.

48:54.514 --> 48:57.430
BUT AT THE WAR ROOM ON
TRUMP TOWER'S 14TH FLOOR,

48:57.514 --> 48:58.764
EUPHORIA.

48:58.847 --> 49:02.097
JUST SHY OF 2:30 AM,
A PRIVATE PHONE CALL TO TRUMP.

49:02.180 --> 49:04.597
CLINTON CONCEDED,
ONLY LATER REVEALING

49:04.681 --> 49:08.764
HER PAIN IN PUBLIC WITH A
PERSONAL PLEA TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

49:08.847 --> 49:12.138
THIS LOSS HURTS, BUT PLEASE

49:12.222 --> 49:14.597
NEVER STOP BELIEVING THAT

49:14.681 --> 49:18.055
FIGHTING FOR WHAT'S
RIGHT IS WORTH IT.

49:18.138 --> 49:21.263
Alexander:
TRUMP AIDES PRAISED IT
AS A VERY CLASSY SPEECH.

49:21.347 --> 49:24.430
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?
ONE TOP REPUBLICAN
STRATEGIST CALLS IT

49:24.514 --> 49:26.555
THE REVENGE OF
THE RURAL WHITE VOTERS

49:26.639 --> 49:29.389
WITH HIGHER TURNOUT THAN
MITT ROMNEY FOUR YEARS AGO.

49:29.472 --> 49:32.180
TRUMP WON WHITES
WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES

49:32.263 --> 49:33.972
BY 39 POINTS.

49:34.055 --> 49:36.180
HE WAS ABLE TO TAP
INTO THIS NOTION THAT...

49:36.263 --> 49:38.806
THAT THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE POLITICAL ELITES

49:38.889 --> 49:42.764
WERE INDIFFERENT AND
DISDAINFUL OF THEIR INTERESTS,

49:42.847 --> 49:44.722
AND I-I THINK THAT
THEY RESENTED IT.

49:44.806 --> 49:46.972
Alexander:
ANOTHER FACTOR?
HILLARY CLINTON'S FAILURE

49:47.055 --> 49:48.764
TO MATCH THE OBAMA COALITION,

49:48.847 --> 49:50.931
AFRICAN AMERICANS
AND MILLENNIALS.

49:51.013 --> 49:53.472
DESPITE A REPUDIATION
OF HIS POLICIES,

49:53.555 --> 49:56.055
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMOTED UNITY.

49:56.138 --> 49:59.555
EVERYBODY IS SAD WHEN THEIR
SIDE LOSES AN ELECTION.

50:01.722 --> 50:05.055
BUT THE DAY AFTER,
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

50:05.138 --> 50:07.389
WE'RE ACTUALLY ALL ON ONE TEAM.

50:07.472 --> 50:10.138
Alexander:
TOMORROW, PRESIDENTS 44 AND 45

50:10.222 --> 50:13.347
WILL MEET AT THE WHITE HOUSE
TO DISCUSS A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

50:13.430 --> 50:15.931
FOR TRUMP, THE HARD PART
IS JUST BEGINNING,
