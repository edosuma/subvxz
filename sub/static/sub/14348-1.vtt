15 Battalion to Manhattan. Transfer
all hands at 1-5-4 121st Street.

00:36.438 --> 00:39.423
There's a report of a woman
unaccounted for on the third floor.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.409
Is she black? Given the
neighborhood, I guess she is. Why?

00:42.444 --> 00:44.376
Well, we're racists.

00:44.411 --> 00:47.914
Think how much easier it would be if
we only had to save the white people.

00:47.949 --> 00:50.417
Or even, just, you know,
models. There you go.

00:50.452 --> 00:53.151
You all right?

00:53.186 --> 00:57.924
If she is a model, or even just a model
type, I got dibs on the mouth-to-mouth.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.926
Okay.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.893
I'm serious.
It's a deal.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.931
Here you go.
Hold it. Right there.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.903
All right.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.941
All right?
Yeah. Do it.

01:24.717 --> 01:27.620
We got one on the second
floor! We need you up here now!

01:28.121 --> 01:31.057
Pull him up. Got him? Yeah.

01:42.969 --> 01:46.406
Still wanna give her that
mouth-to-mouth? Too afraid of falling in.

01:46.441 --> 01:48.908
Christ!
One, two, three!

01:49.409 --> 01:50.910
Turn her the other way.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.913
Jesus!
She's no Atkins client.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.881
What's that?
She's fat!

01:56.916 --> 01:59.919
Well, no shit, Sherlock. Come on! Grab!

02:03.923 --> 02:08.761
When will these people learn to
stop eatin', for Christ's sake?

02:14.667 --> 02:18.638
I'm gonna grab the ax
in the alley.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.077
Tommy!

02:25.512 --> 02:27.312
Hey, Tom!

02:27.347 --> 02:29.647
Tom!
Can you hear me?

02:29.682 --> 02:33.019
Chief, I got a man down. I need some
help up here. The whole ceiling collapsed.

02:33.054 --> 02:35.488
I can't see him at all!
Hey, Tom!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.858
Let's go!

02:37.893 --> 02:40.158
Tommy? Tommy!

02:40.193 --> 02:43.530
-Tommy? Tommy!
- We need you up here now!

02:43.565 --> 02:45.330
Tommy!

02:45.365 --> 02:48.368
Listen, I got Tommy down
under a pile of debris.

02:48.403 --> 02:51.371
I got monster flames--
Tommy! Tommy!

03:07.654 --> 03:12.225
It could've been so perfect.
We had everything.

03:14.561 --> 03:19.232
By the way,
I'm sorry I sold the house.

03:20.733 --> 03:24.737
I had to take the kids away,
Tommy. I had to.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.710
He's kicking.
Wanna feel?

03:32.745 --> 03:37.250
Only a matter of time, Tommy
boy. You almost got me killed.

03:37.750 --> 03:41.254
Sooner or later you were gonna
take somebody out for good.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.688
Payback's a bitch, bro.

03:43.723 --> 03:48.695
I wish I could kiss those two little
dimples on your lower back one last time.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.697
You know---
just above your ass.

03:52.432 --> 03:56.436
Your skinny little
double-grapefruit Irish ass.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.776
If you're ready, it's okay.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.780
Touch my tits, baby.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.552
Lick my neck. Now.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.630
Why don't I move
the three kids over there...

04:23.997 --> 04:26.966
and you see what kind of
parenting you do by yourself.

04:29.235 --> 04:33.072
Tom.
Follow me, brother.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.773
I love you.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.645
Don't go now, Tommy.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.164
Hey, Tom!

06:08.735 --> 06:11.703
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

06:11.738 --> 06:15.041
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

06:15.076 --> 06:18.161
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:18.196 --> 06:21.247
Things were good
when we were young

06:21.614 --> 06:24.584
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

06:24.619 --> 06:27.920
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

06:27.955 --> 06:31.174
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:31.209 --> 06:34.394
Things were good
when we were young

06:34.429 --> 06:37.598
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

06:37.633 --> 06:40.951
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

06:40.986 --> 06:44.296
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

06:44.331 --> 06:47.607
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

07:17.970 --> 07:19.972
Goddamn it.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.722
Moron.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.876
Ohh! Aah! Oww!

07:40.911 --> 07:43.996
God.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.673
Probie's still dating
the fat chick.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.927
I wa-- I was, uh--
I was--

07:57.962 --> 08:00.144
Chief's wife
is all right.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.682
He said she gets worse
as the day goes on.

08:03.182 --> 08:06.686
Supposed to be typical with
Alzheimer's. Pretty sad.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.689
I got this new girlfriend
and she's into antiques.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.191
I remembered that
antique shop up here...

08:12.226 --> 08:14.158
and went to
look at some stuff--

08:14.193 --> 08:17.029
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, asshole?

08:17.396 --> 08:18.865
I've helped you concoct...

08:19.365 --> 08:21.367
some of the best bullshit cover
stories-- This is not concoction, okay?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.369
under the worst possible
pressure situations.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.371
I have
a new girlfriend. Okay?

08:25.872 --> 08:30.376
Antiques and my new girlfriend. Why don't
you kiss my goddamn giant Irish pisshole.

08:33.379 --> 08:36.847
I've seen you out here in your truck
10, 20 times in the last three months.

08:36.883 --> 08:41.220
I figure you must be desperate to know
what's going on, so I figured I'd fill you in.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.529
So, uh,
how's the new guy?

08:51.564 --> 08:54.567
Sully? Goddamn great.
Decent cook too.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.836
Really?
Yeah.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.571
How is he
in the shit?

08:59.071 --> 09:03.075
Oh, he's terrific. We caught
a fire a couple weeks back.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.710
Hot, smoky fire.

09:05.745 --> 09:10.214
We could hear this kid screaming
for help. He sounded real close.

09:10.249 --> 09:14.587
Franco goes in to help him, but
Sully grabs him at the last moment...

09:14.622 --> 09:16.554
and pulls him back out.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.557
He saved Franco
from getting hurt again.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.094
Kid's in the hospital, you know,
but he'll be all right.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.931
You haven't asked about
Franco. Is he all right?

09:24.966 --> 09:27.199
For the most part.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.201
Shoulder's still
giving him trouble, you know.

09:29.702 --> 09:32.705
He probably shouldn't have come back
to work so soon, but you know him.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.208
Laura's been helping him out with Keela cause
Franco's mom is busy taking care of his dad.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.211
His dad's in bad shape.

09:39.512 --> 09:43.549
- You should give him a call.
- Yeah, I, uh, thought about it.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.086
Thought about it
a lot actually.

09:47.121 --> 09:48.788
Well, I should be getting back.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.456
Yeah,
I-I gotta get to work.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.468
9/11 cookies here!
They're going fast!

10:02.503 --> 10:04.268
9/11 cookies.

10:04.303 --> 10:08.223
Cookies. Get your cookies.
We gotta light our tower here.

10:08.258 --> 10:12.144
I got some twin towers here
that light up. Battery operated.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.946
Get your cookies, guys.
T-shirts here!

10:14.981 --> 10:19.986
9/11 twin towers! Always
remember! Never forget!

10:28.494 --> 10:30.962
Sal. Vinny. Tony.
What's up?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.964
Better late than never, huh? Yeah.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.466
Drove by Ground Zero
again this morning.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.505
Goddamn morons are still selling those
twin towers cookies. Sons of bitches.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.675
Oh, Jesus Christ.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.475
All right.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.948
Still got two more coming
to me, all right? Ready?

10:49.215 --> 10:51.183
Cock. Tits.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.152
Going outside
for a smoke.

10:55.187 --> 10:59.692
You know-- You say one thing to
me about cancer, and I swear to--

11:09.035 --> 11:11.537
Hey, you missed a spot
right here.

11:11.572 --> 11:13.572
Hey, Tommy!
Tommy!

11:13.607 --> 11:15.506
Hey, Paulie.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.544
I got the pictures
from the big car fire!

11:18.579 --> 11:21.047
Where are they?

11:21.547 --> 11:24.383
In my mom's room. I was showing
her. All right. No big thing.

11:24.418 --> 11:27.553
Where's your jacket?
Oh, man!

11:27.787 --> 11:29.822
Don't worry. Go grab my
bunker jacket. It's cold.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.657
Carmine, the probie!

11:32.158 --> 11:35.161
Hey, Paulie. Can't wait to see those
pictures you took of the big car fire.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.163
I'm cold.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.165
Hurry up.

11:39.665 --> 11:43.669
That was legendary, what you did on
that job the other day-- the car fire.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.637
Yeah, right, right.

11:46.672 --> 11:50.176
Yeah, nothing
but excitement out here.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.680
Let's light that car on fire
and put it out.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.682
That'd kill
a couple hours.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.397
- Hello?
- Hey. Long time no see.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.935
You got that right.
How you doin', pal?

12:16.435 --> 12:20.404
You heard? Well, I heard some things.

12:20.439 --> 12:23.442
So, did you, uh, get kicked
out of the priesthood,

12:23.477 --> 12:25.444
you retire on your own,
or what?

12:25.479 --> 12:27.244
Little bit of both.

12:27.279 --> 12:30.247
Look, the only time you call me
is when you're in a tough spot...

12:30.282 --> 12:35.621
and you wanna talk about God, guilt, booze
and bullshit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

12:35.656 --> 12:38.474
So what is it this time?
Booze? Broads?

12:38.509 --> 12:41.319
What, do you got prostate cancer? What?

12:41.354 --> 12:44.130
Nice. Real nice. Oh, so it ain't cancer?

12:44.497 --> 12:48.432
Look, uh, you still,
um--

12:48.467 --> 12:51.136
You still going to A.A.? Yeah.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.771
Yeah, I just--
You know, I--

12:53.806 --> 12:56.308
I been having a rough time
the last couple months, Mick.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.311
It's, uh-- I don't know,
man. It's been tough.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.779
And I was just
thinkin'-- Tom.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.782
The last time I quit drinking, Tommy.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.820
you were the guy
who helped me get started.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.621
I've been having
these dreams.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.492
I had another one last night.
It's--

13:13.993 --> 13:16.495
I don't know what
to make of this stuff.

13:16.996 --> 13:21.000
I was thinking, maybe-- I don't know,
man, maybe it's time for a change.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.002
You know what I mean?
I just--

13:25.504 --> 13:28.006
Mick, you there?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.409
Mick? Hello?

13:30.444 --> 13:32.778
Asshole. Mickey?

13:35.014 --> 13:36.981
Hey.
Hey, Tom.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.483
Look at this. The cops have
been busting my balls for weeks.

13:39.518 --> 13:43.022
I've told you, I can't take care
of every goddamn problem you have...

13:43.057 --> 13:44.989
with every goddamn cop
in the city.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.491
You know what it's like
to park down there?

13:47.526 --> 13:51.363
You should've thought about that before you
left your nice house in Rockaway Beach...

13:51.398 --> 13:53.831
with your nice little lawn and
your nice little goddamn driveway.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.667
Yeah, I should be sitting out there
sipping a beer in my old house...

13:56.702 --> 14:00.206
looking at my other house that she sold to
some new family right out from under my nose--

14:00.241 --> 14:02.173
illegally, I might add.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.878
Speaking of which, here's
your rent for your F.B.I. pal.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.131
Look, he ain't assigned back in
New York for another three months.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.884
That means you've got a place as
long as the cabbage keeps coming.

14:11.919 --> 14:15.221
Don't "okay" me. You know
it's an illegal sublet. Yeah.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.323
Low profile.
Low profile.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.725
Oh, look who's finally here. Hey, Eddie.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.693
Can I get a cup
of coffee, please?

14:22.728 --> 14:25.731
I got 20 minutes before I gotta
be in court. So, what gives?

14:26.098 --> 14:29.068
Well, you tell us. You got
something on Janet and the kids yet?

14:29.103 --> 14:31.337
Tom, we've been over this
on the phone.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.371
I've exhausted
every available option.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.243
I've called in personal favors that I was
saving for extremely dark and rainy days.

14:37.278 --> 14:39.543
It's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.848
He's been working for three months
on the arm. Give him a break.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.584
- I can't afford a real lawyer.
- I am a rea--

14:45.619 --> 14:47.384
I am a real lawyer.
You're my cousin.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.589
Yeah, well, I wish that
could change. Yeah, me too.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.890
Do you think it's easy
tracking her down?

14:52.925 --> 14:57.561
She has the kids call you from pay
phones once a week, for two minutes max.

14:57.596 --> 15:00.866
She hasn't touched her credit cards, and
I doubt she will for a good, long time...

15:00.901 --> 15:02.601
since she got $500,000
for the house.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.069
She kidnapped my kids.

15:05.104 --> 15:08.072
Look, the courts almost always
side with the mother.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.110
Unless you can prove she's a junkie or
a street whore or something like that.

15:11.145 --> 15:13.112
I'm gonna knock his
lights out right now.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.580
I am trying to get you
to listen to some reason.

15:16.615 --> 15:20.452
All right? Can we now figure out
a plan that's actually gonna work?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.920
You gotta get me
a real lawyer.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.958
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey! Cut it out!

15:26.458 --> 15:29.628
Cut it out! Cut it out!
Stop it!

15:30.129 --> 15:32.898
Stop it! What's the
matter with you? Not here!

15:32.933 --> 15:34.900
Look-- Hey! Hey!
What is that?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.403
He started it.

15:37.438 --> 15:39.370
Jesus.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.240
Sorry. Sorry.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.075
You fag.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.776
Yeah? So what?
Super-fag.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.414
"Super-fag"? What the
hell does that mean?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.115
- You know what that means.
-Would you stop it?

15:51.150 --> 15:53.450
Between the 500 grand
and the extra cabbage she has,

15:53.485 --> 15:56.255
she potentially has enough to
live on for a very long time.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.490
Ultra-fag. How long
are we talking about?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.326
I don't know.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.329
Under these circumstances, a woman
stealing off in the dark of night...

16:03.364 --> 16:05.497
to avoid an abusive or
possessive spouse, they don't--

16:05.998 --> 16:07.464
Possessive?
Yeah. Possessive.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.967
They usually stop
all normal modes of behavior.

16:10.002 --> 16:13.005
No shopping for shoes, no shopping for
dresses, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16:13.505 --> 16:17.843
They adopt a bunker mentality. This is,
like, the 10th time I've told you this!

16:17.878 --> 16:20.144
Super-ultra-fag.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.182
I know Janet. She needs to buy
shoes. It's only a matter of time.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.951
Look, I have dealt with women
in these circumstances before--

16:26.452 --> 16:28.252
Is he
still talking to me?

16:28.287 --> 16:30.988
All right, that's it.
I got a case to try.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.860
I got real work to do. You don't
walk out on me. I walk out on you.

16:34.895 --> 16:37.213
Okay? Yeah. Big shock. Yeah. Go.

16:37.248 --> 16:39.531
Call me if you
hear from Dad.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.367
All right?
Mega-mo.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.870
Come on. What you gotta
do that for? Thank you.

16:44.905 --> 16:48.172
Mega-mo?
Look, shithead.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.626
Just for your information,
all right,

16:50.661 --> 16:53.045
"ultra" is way bigger
than "mega."

16:53.545 --> 16:56.382
- No, it's not. No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.717
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.391
Oh, God--
Find my kids.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.393
Nice, Tommy.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.328
Punch in the door!

17:09.828 --> 17:11.829
- Go.
-Kick it in!

17:23.409 --> 17:25.911
I like it with the onions.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.249
What are you--
Hey--

17:41.927 --> 17:44.930
All right. Can you make it?

17:50.602 --> 17:52.604
Somebody left
a couple of smudges.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.114
Uh, send two guys up.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.117
Hey, Kenny.
How's it going?

18:05.617 --> 18:08.085
Good.
You sure?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.872
You look--
I don't know, uh--

18:10.907 --> 18:13.590
I sold the house.
Oh, shit.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.628
I've been packing stuff up.
Finding stuff, you know.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.595
Photos.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.632
Poems I wrote Phyllis.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.599
Divorce
is a bitch, huh?

18:22.634 --> 18:24.636
Well, at least you have
your girlfriend.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.104
Yeah, well,
funny thing about that.

18:27.139 --> 18:31.643
She's got this, I don't know--
it's like a fetish.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.645
She's only into
unavailable men.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.612
Now the wife is gone--

18:35.647 --> 18:38.150
Your fruit is no longer
forbidden. Exactly.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.117
I told her I'm easy.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.155
Flat bacon, hot coffee, an afternoon
blow job three or four times a week.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.122
She didn't bite.
So it's over?

18:45.157 --> 18:50.162
Well, unless I remarry or start seeing
someone else-- then we're back on.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.348
Broads.
Crazy broads.

18:52.383 --> 18:54.465
Speaking of which.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.502
Banker's hours,
sweetheart?

18:56.537 --> 18:58.469
- Sorry, darling.
- Excuse me?

18:58.504 --> 19:01.673
From now on, you call me names,
you're getting them right back.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.010
Don't push it, dollface.
Okay, love lump.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.813
Love lump?
I've used it.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.851
What you making, Sully?
Lamb shanks.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.586
Wow.
They look good.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.357
I've never had those before. Lamb's
good for you. Keeps you regular.

19:18.857 --> 19:21.825
You know the saying. "In
like a lion, out like a lamb"?

19:21.860 --> 19:25.197
- Doesn't that have to do with the weather?
- And your bowels.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.663
Works both ways.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.200
Mmm!
Something smells good!

19:29.235 --> 19:31.668
Yeah, lamb skanks.
Shanks.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.205
Hey, uh, Laura,
will you do me a favor?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.475
If it involves any part
of your body, no.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.675
Actually, I have
physical therapy tonight.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.713
I was hoping you could come over and
look after Keela for a couple hours.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.550
No problem. Usual time?
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.553
Uh, what's
with the camera?

19:48.053 --> 19:49.555
Oh, my folks wanted
to see where I work,

19:50.055 --> 19:52.324
so I figured I'd send them a couple pictures,
give them an idea of what it looks like.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.494
- You gonna take pictures of us?
- I don't want to scare them.

19:55.529 --> 19:58.514
- Is there any more water?
- Out on the floor.

19:58.549 --> 20:01.500
Oh, right. Why replace it
if you use the last one?

20:01.535 --> 20:04.002
No. Make the girl do it.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.971
Hey, take a picture
of me.

20:08.006 --> 20:12.376
You know what you should do? Take out
your cock and take a picture of it.

20:12.411 --> 20:15.914
- I'm gonna do it right here.
- No, no, no. Don't take your cock out in the kitchen.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.215
- Why not?
- I don't know. That's what my mother always said. Go.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.752
The look on her face when she gets
these developed is gonna be great.

20:20.787 --> 20:25.257
- You, go watch the door.
- Very adult, guys. A new high.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.929
- You do it?
- Hang on. I'm trying to figure out which is my best side.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.665
Oh, yeah, it's the left.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.768
Here she comes!

20:43.609 --> 20:45.544
What's everybody
so happy about?

20:45.579 --> 20:47.613
Oh, just,
it's more water.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.127
Whew.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.931
Excuse me, miss.
Yes?

21:07.966 --> 21:10.802
I was kinda wondering
if you could help me out.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.270
I'm a firefighter.
Really?

21:13.305 --> 21:16.642
Uh, anyway,
I was injured recently--

21:16.677 --> 21:18.942
I got scarred up
pretty bad.

21:18.977 --> 21:24.483
Um, anyway, I saw you here and, to tell
you the truth, I wanted to ask you out,

21:24.518 --> 21:27.753
but I guess, because of the injury,
I didn't really have the nerve.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.988
I don't see any scars.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.757
It's on my neck.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.993
- Would you show me?
- Nah, I don't want to.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.163
- Please. I work at Christ the Savior.
- Oh, you're a nun?

21:38.563 --> 21:41.099
A nurse.
It's a hospital in Queens.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.899
Oh.
Thank God.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.670
I've probably seen worse.

21:47.172 --> 21:51.677
Oh, it happened a couple of months
ago, huh? I can tell by the redness.

21:51.712 --> 21:55.180
Um, I can suggest
something for that.

21:55.215 --> 21:58.183
Oh, yeah?
Thanks.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.186
It's my phone number.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.856
I live around the block.
So call me.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.858
All right.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.531
You want to
see a movie?

22:13.031 --> 22:15.033
There's a great French film
playing downtown. Truffaut.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.035
Honey.
What?

22:17.536 --> 22:19.037
Come on.
What?

22:19.538 --> 22:21.039
Those French movies suck.
It's Fran?ois Truffaut.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.041
I don't care
what it's called.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.043
Okay, that's the name
of the filmmaker.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.045
Don't worry--
there are subtitles.

22:27.546 --> 22:30.048
I hate those. You gotta read
while you're watching the movie.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.051
If I wanted to read, I'd stay
home and read a book. Oh, really?

22:33.552 --> 22:36.054
You haven't read anything other than a cereal
box the entire four months we've been together.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.557
Oh, bullshit! I read! You read what?

22:39.057 --> 22:42.060
The vari-speed section
of my dildo manual?

22:42.095 --> 22:44.528
Aha! What else?
What else?

22:44.563 --> 22:47.531
I'm reading th-- that new
Mickey Mantle biography.

22:47.566 --> 22:52.070
I bought you that book two months
ago, and you're on the third page.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.573
So?
I'm savoring it.

22:54.608 --> 22:56.540
Savoring?
Yeah.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.578
It means... taking my time.

22:59.613 --> 23:01.545
Enjoying it.
Right?

23:01.580 --> 23:05.584
You can buy those
towers here. Twenty dollars.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.766
Ohh!

23:21.266 --> 23:25.604
You want cookies? You want
cookies? Huh? You son of a bitch.

23:25.639 --> 23:28.405
How about a cookie
with my cousin's face on it?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.943
Last report they had on him the morning
of 9/11, he was stuck in this tower.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.744
How about that?

23:33.779 --> 23:35.912
You want a cookie?
Yeah?

23:35.947 --> 23:37.914
Who you callin'?
I'm calling the cops.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.786
-Oh, yeah? You calling the cops? You got any cop cookies?
-No!

23:41.286 --> 23:43.955
Then don't call them, 'cause they
ain't gonna be happy. You want cookies?

23:44.322 --> 23:47.257
-Here's your cookies.
Let me tell you somethin'.

23:47.292 --> 23:52.297
Tell your friends all across America,
don't come down here to buy cookies!

23:52.332 --> 23:57.302
Come down here to honor 343 brave,
brave men who gave their lives!

23:57.337 --> 23:59.770
Bow your head to 'em!

23:59.805 --> 24:03.391
And think about their
fallen brothers left behind!

24:03.426 --> 24:06.978
You want cookies? Huh?
Then call Pepperidge Farms.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.980
Yeah!

24:09.981 --> 24:12.949
Hey, buddy! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, guys.

24:12.984 --> 24:15.487
Come on. Come on. Freedom
of speech. Freedom of speech.

24:15.987 --> 24:18.490
Drunk and disorderly.
Public urination.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.457
Destruction of
private property.

24:20.492 --> 24:23.495
Which charge you wanna argue about,
shithead? I'm a fireman. Come on.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.965
A fireman making a fool of himself.
Haven't seen much of that lately.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.935
You know they have no cop cookies,
right? Seriously, take a look.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.938
Not one cop cookie.
Swear to God.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.423
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
I owe you.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.442
Don't forget
theLion Kingtickets.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.945
Four seats.
Uh, front row.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.950
Lion King?What are you, like, the
king of Broadway all of a sudden?

24:44.985 --> 24:49.486
You know, man, you're a worthless
piece of shit! Goddamn you!

24:49.521 --> 24:54.125
Son of a bitch-- You know what,
Johnny? I've had enough of your shit.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.867
What's going on?

25:05.036 --> 25:08.807
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

25:08.842 --> 25:10.542
Assholes!
Get out of here!

25:11.042 --> 25:12.544
Relax, man!
Come on!

25:13.044 --> 25:15.345
Mind your own goddamn business. Yeah!

25:15.380 --> 25:18.383
Can't have a discussion on the
sidewalk without somebody butting in.

25:18.418 --> 25:20.886
Just trying to help!
Yeah, yeah.

25:20.921 --> 25:24.322
You--

25:24.589 --> 25:27.058
You listen to me, asshole, and
you listen real goddamn hard.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.060
You are officially through.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.898
No more parking ticket favors, no more
background checks, no more legal work on the arm.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.733
You're through.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.335
You want your kids back?
For what?

25:37.370 --> 25:39.536
So they can live
in some shithole...

25:39.571 --> 25:42.574
with their drunk-ass, lowlife,
thickheaded Mick father?

25:42.609 --> 25:45.542
I don't think so, numb-nuts!
Clean up your act, Tommy!

25:45.577 --> 25:50.081
'Cause then and only then are me, or Eddie,
or anybody gonna help you find your kids.

25:52.417 --> 25:56.187
- Don't you dare call me until you get your ass back in A.A.
- Yeah.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.090
And don't screw up that
apartment deal, Tommy. Low pro.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.845
Oh, man.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.764
Goddamn it.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.791
Hey, kid. Come here.
What? What's going on?

26:16.826 --> 26:19.544
Get over here.
We may have a situation.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.379
What?
With your cock.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.048
My cock?

26:23.348 --> 26:26.284
Did you really take a picture of
it yesterday with Laura's camera?

26:26.319 --> 26:28.084
Yeah.
Well, you told me to.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.420
- Shit.
- What? What? What's wrong?

26:30.455 --> 26:34.424
I was talking to a pal. I told him
what you did. He says it's illegal.

26:34.459 --> 26:38.296
If you take pornographic images and
have the film developed commercially--

26:38.797 --> 26:40.764
Shit.
Yeah.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.802
Unless Laura has a darkroom at home,
she could get in a lot of trouble.

26:43.837 --> 26:45.804
She could be arrested.
What? Shit.

26:46.304 --> 26:48.807
You gotta get that camera
away from her. H-How?

26:49.307 --> 26:51.810
Don't look at me, junior. You got
yourself into this. Get yourself out.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.812
Sully,
you told me to do it.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.314
That won't hold up
in court.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.818
Hi.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.787
Goddamn cabbie.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.789
It takes me
25 minutes to get one,

27:05.824 --> 27:08.827
and the one I get's got terrorist written
all over him, he stinks like camel shit,

27:09.327 --> 27:14.332
he's got a turban and this long beard
and this smocky thing instead of a shirt.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.800
Holy shit.
What happened to your face?

27:16.835 --> 27:20.338
Oh, a little discussion
with my brother Johnny.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.842
I'm gonna take a shower.

27:23.877 --> 27:25.844
All right.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.357
Coming through.
Cover up.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.826
Hey.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.328
See you tomorrow.
Hey, listen, Laura.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.116
I've been thinking about
taking some pictures,

27:48.151 --> 27:50.834
and I don't really know
anything about cameras.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.872
But that seemed like a nice
one that you had the other day.

27:53.907 --> 27:55.839
Nice?
It's disposable, Sean.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.842
Oh. Really? Well, it's
just my speed. You know?

27:58.877 --> 28:02.380
Could I just take a look at it? Just see if
it's right for me before I spend the money?

28:02.415 --> 28:05.181
They cost 10 bucks. You can
buy it at the supermarket.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.553
If I could take a quick look, borrow it
for the night, just get a feel for it--

28:08.588 --> 28:10.221
Go buy one.
I can't look at yours?

28:10.722 --> 28:12.724
I dropped mine off
to be developed this morning.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.727
I'm picking the pictures up
on my way home.

28:16.227 --> 28:19.731
Oh. Oh. Okay.
Well, uh, good night.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.234
Freak.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.442
Do you have
any conditioner?

29:04.943 --> 29:06.444
On the sink.

29:35.974 --> 29:38.309
Stop. Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.777
What? Ow!
Stop it!

29:40.812 --> 29:42.814
You smell and taste
like whiskey.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.283
You know
I can't drink.

29:47.318 --> 29:49.786
You know what it's like to
smell and taste booze...

29:49.821 --> 29:52.824
on the breath of someone you're sleeping
with when you yourself can't drink?

29:52.859 --> 29:55.326
I'm sorry. I didn't think
of that. It's upsetting.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.329
I can fix it.
Just a sec.

29:59.831 --> 30:02.465
Two secs.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.838
I just think it's better, you know, if
the two of us are on, like, the same page.

30:06.873 --> 30:10.341
Shh. Tryin' to keep
a low profile.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.343
Right. Two secs.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.851
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.853
Pouring myself a vodka.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.990
What?

30:27.025 --> 30:30.495
It's completely odorless.
Smell.

30:30.530 --> 30:33.965
You are so annoying.
You know that?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.932
I'll put it back.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.934
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.

30:37.969 --> 30:40.671
- Why?
- 'Cause you're a Neanderthal.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.374
- I'm so sick of this apartment!
- Shh!

30:43.409 --> 30:45.842
- I swear to God.
- What?

30:45.877 --> 30:48.344
- One of these days.
- I can't hear what you're saying.

30:48.379 --> 30:51.681
One of these days, Tommy--
- Shh! You shush!

30:51.716 --> 30:54.552
You have no respect for me,
no respect for this baby.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.352
Self-centered ass!

30:56.387 --> 30:58.855
Shh! Shh! Shh!

30:58.890 --> 31:02.358
See?

31:02.393 --> 31:04.395
What are you doing?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.923
- Oh. You know what? I'm gonna go.
- Shh!

31:31.958 --> 31:34.092
Out the front door!

31:38.096 --> 31:39.597
Really?
Yeah. Really.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.100
Really?

31:44.936 --> 31:47.605
Oh, hello. Yes.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.892
- Meet your new neighbor.
- I--

31:50.927 --> 31:53.778
I don't actually live here,
per se.

31:56.514 --> 31:59.384
Nice to meet you.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.789
Think you might need this. Ah, Jesus!

32:04.824 --> 32:07.292
That's not even funny,
Tommy.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.260
What are you doing here?

32:10.295 --> 32:13.965
Well, I was just in the neighborhood and
I thought-- Yeah? What, are you antiquing?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.801
- Very funny.
- Staten Island keeping you busy, huh?

32:17.302 --> 32:19.804
Oh, yeah, yeah, man. It's
nonstop action over there.

32:19.839 --> 32:22.491
Am I gonna die,
Mr. Fireman?

32:22.526 --> 32:25.143
Yep. Eventually.
But not today.

32:25.178 --> 32:27.110
My mom's gonna kill us.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.148
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need a pound
of butter and a whipsaw. All right?

32:30.183 --> 32:32.882
What's a whipsaw?

32:32.917 --> 32:35.153
We, uh-- We had a car fire
last week.

32:35.188 --> 32:37.655
Really? Yeah. Messy, messy job.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.424
Pretty scary.

32:46.764 --> 32:50.001
Tommy, Tommy, stay back.
It looks like it might blow.

32:50.036 --> 32:53.021
We've got plenty of time.
Don't worry about it.

32:53.056 --> 32:55.972
Come on, Tommy, watch it.
Come on, let's go.

32:56.007 --> 32:59.010
I gotta tell you, I never seen
a group of guys move so quick.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.012
It's like
they were cheetahs.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.813
Wow.
Yeah.

33:03.848 --> 33:06.649
How's your, uh, new guy?

33:06.684 --> 33:09.152
He still working out?
Oh, yeah, sure. Sully?

33:09.187 --> 33:14.459
Yeah. He's kind of like you, you know,
without the, uh-- without the angst.

33:14.494 --> 33:16.194
Yeah.

33:16.694 --> 33:18.196
My angst.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.699
Of course, my angst serves me
pretty well with my new group of--

33:21.734 --> 33:24.667
Cheetahs.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.537
Yeah.
Cheetahs.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.126
All right, look, Tommy,

33:32.161 --> 33:34.344
we do this, right--

33:34.379 --> 33:35.880
I go to Perrolli with this,

33:36.280 --> 33:39.317
you and I gotta be crystal-goddamn-clear
about a couple things.

33:39.352 --> 33:41.986
Okay, okay. You gotta
get off the booze, Tom.

33:42.253 --> 33:45.723
No more drinking-- in the house,
before you get to the house, on the job.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.725
It's a big-ticket item,
Tom. Taken care of.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.995
No problem.
What else?

33:52.230 --> 33:55.733
You gotta make things
right with Franco.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.735
Face to face.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.226
- Hello.
- Hey, Mick. What's up?

34:23.261 --> 34:26.531
- You know that meeting you used to take me to?
- That ain't funny, Tom.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.266
- I'm serious, Mick.
- All right.

34:29.302 --> 34:31.768
St. Michael's.
Tonight.

34:31.804 --> 34:35.237
Every night.
7:00.

34:35.273 --> 34:38.443
- I'll meet you at out front, at, uh, quarter of.
- All right. I'll see you there.

34:38.478 --> 34:40.277
Hey, Tom?
Yeah?

34:41.779 --> 34:44.782
Don't bust my balls. I
ain't busting balls, Mick.

34:44.817 --> 34:47.802
All right?
I need the help.

34:47.837 --> 34:50.788
Thanks.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.478
Hey. Hi, Laura.
Wow. What a surprise.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.981
Sorry to bother you
on your day off.

35:17.016 --> 35:18.948
No, no, it's okay.
Come on in.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.486
I had kind of
an interesting evening.

35:21.521 --> 35:23.453
I mean,
not the whole evening.

35:23.488 --> 35:27.492
Just the part where I picked up
my pictures at the drugstore.

35:27.527 --> 35:29.292
Oh, yeah?
Well, how so?

35:29.327 --> 35:31.662
Knock it off, Garrity. I
know it was you. I'm so sorry.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.499
It wasn't my idea.
Sully told me to do it.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.302
Yeah, I don't have to
get that.

35:39.337 --> 35:42.340
Do you know how lucky you are that
the guy at the drugstore is my friend?

35:42.375 --> 35:44.842
I could've gone to jail,
asshole. I know. I'm sorry.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.613
I didn't know what I was doing
when I was, you know, posing.

35:48.648 --> 35:50.515
I just-- I found out later.
Okay?

35:51.015 --> 35:54.185
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean, how mad are you?

35:54.220 --> 35:57.487
I was pretty mad.
I'm over it now.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.691
Oh. That's good. Thanks.
That's real nice of you.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.493
I was actually furious.

36:03.528 --> 36:07.365
And then I took your picture and
I downloaded it onto my computer...

36:07.732 --> 36:09.665
and--

36:09.700 --> 36:13.203
attached it to an ad for
gay sex on Craig's List.com.

36:13.238 --> 36:16.707
I hope you don't mind. I
gave them your home number.

36:18.709 --> 36:22.213
Oh, and I gave them your
cell too. Have a nice day.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.996
Hi. What are you
doing out here?

36:39.263 --> 36:42.131
I saw you
with that geek, Theresa.

36:42.166 --> 36:46.504
Look, it's just some guy that
I met. We talked and had coffee.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.506
Look, I know
you think I'm stupid.

36:48.773 --> 36:51.842
You're not as dumb as you make
yourself out to be, Michael.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.844
What's that
supposed to mean?

36:55.346 --> 36:57.313
Look, Michael, I think--

36:57.348 --> 37:00.316
Look, I know I'm not
as smart as you and stuff,

37:00.351 --> 37:03.354
and I don't like to do stuff that
you like to do and stuff, you know,

37:03.854 --> 37:06.357
but, I mean,
the sex is great, right?

37:09.860 --> 37:13.197
The sex is just okay.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.898
Get out!
Are you serious?

37:15.933 --> 37:19.203
What about all
my special... tricks?

37:20.938 --> 37:24.942
If I was attracted to tricks,
I'd be blowing David Copperfield.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.945
Oh, so that's his name,
the guy you met?

37:29.947 --> 37:31.949
Maybe you shouldn't come in.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.969
Hey, asshole!

38:04.315 --> 38:06.817
Your phone, Daddy. Thank you, cutie pie.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.821
Who is it?

38:11.322 --> 38:12.823
Nobody.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.793
Frank, it's me.

38:15.828 --> 38:17.727
Uh, just callin'...

38:17.762 --> 38:22.166
'cause, uh, I haven't
talked to you in a while...

38:22.201 --> 38:24.001
and I kinda
wanted to catch up.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.968
You know?

38:26.003 --> 38:30.508
Maybe, I don't know,
grab a cup of coffee, say hello.

38:32.009 --> 38:34.011
Call me.

38:53.531 --> 38:56.534
You have one new message.

38:58.803 --> 39:00.538
Here, talk to your father.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.005
Dad?
It's just the machine, Connor.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.008
Can you come see us soon?
I can't find that firehouse.

39:06.043 --> 39:09.046
Can you look for it?
Give the phone to Katy, Connor.

39:09.081 --> 39:12.014
I really, really,
really miss you, Daddy.

39:12.049 --> 39:15.052
I drew you a picture
of Uncle Jimmy.

39:15.087 --> 39:17.071
Stop crying, Katy.

39:17.106 --> 39:19.021
Daddy.

39:19.056 --> 39:22.059
I don't want to talk.
Talk to your father now, please.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.061
No!

39:56.761 --> 39:59.263
Oh, mama

39:59.497 --> 40:03.033
Don't walk away

40:04.435 --> 40:07.503
I'm a goddamn sore loser

40:07.538 --> 40:11.073
I ain't too proud to say

40:11.108 --> 40:15.195
And I'm still
thinking 'bout you

40:15.230 --> 40:19.283
I'm so lonesome without you ?

40:19.318 --> 40:22.620
I can't get you out

40:22.655 --> 40:25.456
My mind

40:27.458 --> 40:29.460
What-- What is your name?

40:29.495 --> 40:31.927
Oh, mama

40:31.962 --> 40:35.232
Don't lead me on

40:36.967 --> 40:39.720
With my soul
shut down so tight

40:39.755 --> 40:42.473
Just like
a stone-cold tomb

40:43.974 --> 40:46.442
Ain't it clear
when I'm near you

40:46.477 --> 40:51.749
We are here at the fifth annual
Keefe vs. Gavin Super Bowl Bonanza.

40:52.249 --> 40:55.152
Unfortunately you have the bum
knee. You won't be playing.

40:55.187 --> 40:58.053
But you are the
super-marvelous photographer.

40:58.088 --> 41:01.659
What do you got to say to your
daddy? You ready for the game?

41:01.694 --> 41:04.460
Uh, I love him
very, very, very much.

41:04.495 --> 41:07.229
Who's the best dad
in the whole world?

41:07.264 --> 41:10.501
Daddy's the best daddy in the whole
wide world. And who's the best mom?

41:10.536 --> 41:12.503
You are.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.341
Jimmy!

41:20.678 --> 41:23.781
Oh, there's blood
on the floor

41:24.048 --> 41:27.418
It's 'cause of this heart
on my sleeve

41:27.453 --> 41:30.753
That's bleeding

41:30.788 --> 41:33.290
I knew I was always
meant for the camera.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.793
And my soul's
shut down so tight

41:36.093 --> 41:37.628
Tonight

41:40.264 --> 41:44.301
Ain't it clear when I'm
near you Dad, go away! Stop.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.771
I'm just dying
to hear you

41:46.806 --> 41:49.171
Stop! Go away!
Stop! Go away!

41:49.206 --> 41:51.208
Callin' my name
one more time

41:54.712 --> 41:56.213
Whoo!
Thank you!

41:58.582 --> 42:03.053
We love Dad! We love Dad!
We love Dad!

42:03.554 --> 42:05.521
Oh, shit!

42:05.556 --> 42:10.060
Goddamn it! Must be something
in the air that I'm breathing

42:10.895 --> 42:15.197
Yes, I try to ignore

42:15.232 --> 42:18.736
All this blood
on the floor

42:19.236 --> 42:22.907
It's just this heart
on my sleeve

42:22.942 --> 42:25.342
That's bleeding

42:29.346 --> 42:31.348
Oh, mama

42:32.850 --> 42:34.351
Ohh-ohh

42:37.855 --> 42:39.822
You leave me here
a-reelin'

42:39.857 --> 42:44.361
Gone away so long

42:44.862 --> 42:48.115
Sayin' the love
that we had

42:48.150 --> 42:51.333
Was just selfish and sad

42:51.368 --> 42:53.370
Yes, but to see you now
with him

42:53.405 --> 42:56.140
Is just making me mad

42:56.175 --> 42:58.841
We love Dad!
We love Dad!

42:58.876 --> 43:03.714
We love Dad! We love Dad!
We love Dad!

43:06.450 --> 43:08.952
I was standing here

43:08.987 --> 43:11.455
Burning in my skin

43:13.457 --> 43:16.210
Yes, I was standing here

43:16.245 --> 43:18.963
Burning in my skin

44:11.081 --> 44:12.016
Cloudland.
