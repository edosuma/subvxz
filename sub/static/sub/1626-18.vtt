09:39.379 --> 09:41.346
No, you're the type of person
who almost wants him

09:41.348 --> 09:42.581
To leave his wife.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.482
Yes! Yes, that's me!

09:44.484 --> 09:46.051
I'm the "almost" girl.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.354
I almost lost my virginity
25 times.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.855
This was my conversation
with my friends

09:50.857 --> 09:52.324
Every Monday in high school:

09:52.326 --> 09:53.692
"did you?"

09:53.694 --> 09:57.162
"almost."

09:57.164 --> 10:01.666
Funny, 'cause I almost
went to high school.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.768
Max, I have to figure out
what to do about nicolas

10:03.770 --> 10:05.904
Before he almost
makes a big mistake

10:05.906 --> 10:07.839
And leaves his wife.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.842
He's not leaving
his wife for you.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.877
It's just a thing you say
to pretty women

10:12.879 --> 10:15.547
To get them into bed.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.682
Like, "I'm a russian prince,"

10:17.684 --> 10:21.386
Or, "that was a good story."

10:21.388 --> 10:23.755
With a tank top collection
like yours,

10:23.757 --> 10:27.425
I'm surprised
you have to say anything.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.261
I know, right?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.931
So you don't really think
he's serious about leaving her?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.100
No. I've told
dozens of women

10:35.102 --> 10:36.401
I'm leaving my wife
for them,

10:36.403 --> 10:40.071
And I'm not even married.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.974
Here in america.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.776
That was nice of oleg.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.145
Just when you think you've seen
every part of a person--

10:47.147 --> 10:50.415
'cause he's shown you
on his phone--

10:50.417 --> 10:51.883
He surprises you.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.118
Oh, I feel so much better.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.619
Nicolas is not going
to leave her.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.621
No, why would he
leave her for you?

10:56.623 --> 11:00.325
Well, you don't have to be
nasty about it.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.160
[cell phone jingles]

11:02.162 --> 11:04.062
Max, I just got
another text from nicolas

11:04.064 --> 11:05.630
About him leaving his wife.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.332
Oleg, now he says
he's telling his wife

11:07.334 --> 11:10.168
Tomorrow at 4:00
that he's leaving her.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.137
You got a timeframe?

11:12.139 --> 11:15.306
Oh, if he puts a clock on it,
it's happening.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.409
Pick-up, cantaloupe.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.878
Max, there's a clock on it.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.479
But isn't his wife in France?

11:21.481 --> 11:22.814
Yeah, but they skype
every day.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.483
They're like the french jetsons.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.919
He's gonna skype
break up with her?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.387
That is low.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.357
And smart.
Might steal that move one day.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.359
Oh, good, I see
your wrist is better,

11:34.361 --> 11:35.727
And I'm gonna need some help.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.429
The cleaning situation
has gotten

11:37.431 --> 11:40.765
A little complicated.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.235
The spider communities
are at war.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.071
Han, I can't clean.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.039
I'm in the middle
of ruining someone's marriage.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.176
Then, max, please.
Things are escalating quickly.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.844
There was
a discarded piece of ham,

11:52.846 --> 11:56.848
And apparently both kingdoms
thought it was theirs.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.851
Oh, no takers?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.286
All right, enough
with all this texting.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.787
I need to stop this.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.289
I have to go
over to his place tomorrow

12:04.291 --> 12:05.523
And tell him face to face.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.991
Tell him face to face?

12:06.993 --> 12:09.060
I don't even have sex
face to face.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.000
I hope nicolas takes my
breaking it off with him okay,

12:16.002 --> 12:17.502
Because in my fantasy
when I told him,

12:17.504 --> 12:19.104
He wouldn't take no
for an answer,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.605
Bought me a plane,
and I gave jennifer lawrence

12:20.607 --> 12:22.006
A ride home.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.675
In my fantasy,

12:23.677 --> 12:25.176
A talking dragon
gave me a cape

12:25.178 --> 12:27.679
That belonged to jesus.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.447
But that's probably
because I took too many

12:29.449 --> 12:32.617
Of deke's vicodin earlier.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.786
The lobby told me
you were on your way up.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.021
Caroline, I did not expect you.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.891
But you knew
I'd be coming?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.627
We need to talk, and max is here
for moral support.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.862
I know how this works
by now.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.363
Come in.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.165
Okay, how do I put this?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.200
How do I put this?
Nicolas,

12:49.202 --> 12:53.304
I came here today
to tell you...

12:53.306 --> 12:55.573
To not do that.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.209
But why?
I want you so much.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.878
Okay, you--
you don't want me.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.212
You don't even
really know me.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.581
I do. You're sexy
and funny and pretty

13:03.583 --> 13:04.883
And smart.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.051
Okay, you know me
a little.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.254
Look, I am not
the type of person

13:09.256 --> 13:11.055
Who breaks up marriages.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.290
No, she's the "almost" girl.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.626
She almost
breaks up marriages.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.461
Yes, yes,
that's who I am.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.896
So I don't want you
to make that call

13:17.898 --> 13:19.230
And break up with your wife
over skype.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.299
I am not breaking up with her
over skype.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.068
Okay, great, perfect.
No skype.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.436
No.
[door buzzes]

13:25.438 --> 13:27.972
Because that's her
in the lobby.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.042
I'm breaking up with her
in person.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.517
[door buzzing]

13:39.519 --> 13:41.753
Oh, my god, that's your wife
in the lobby?

13:41.755 --> 13:43.087
Your wife is here?

13:43.089 --> 13:44.322
What are we gonna do?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.257
Calm down.
I can fix this.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.859
You need a fake mustache,
a fistful of paprika,

13:47.861 --> 13:49.494
And a new passport.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.862
If you don't have
all three of those things,

13:50.864 --> 13:52.263
I can make it work with two,

13:52.265 --> 13:55.233
As long as one of them
is a mustache.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.235
There's no other way out.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.003
Come on, max, we have to get
out of here now.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.039
Oh, oh, yeah, and, uh,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.340
Don't leave your wife for me.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.575
Whatever we had, it's over.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.210
Oh, and...

14:05.212 --> 14:06.845
This shouldn't reflect badly
on me in school,

14:06.847 --> 14:09.113
'cause I worked hard
for that c-minus.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.282
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.685
Okay, but only because she just
got out of the elevator.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.387
She can't find me here.
I can't be this girl.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.957
I don't want to be the whore
he's leaving her for.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.225
[gasps]
that's my favorite

14:20.227 --> 14:22.093
Dr. Seuss book.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.895
Caroline, what are you saying?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.197
You were just leading me on
this whole time?

14:26.199 --> 14:29.467
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it, pepe le pew.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.270
And, yes, I've been saving
that one for after finals.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.072
It is not just caroline.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.974
You're been chasing after her
harder than a fat kid

14:35.976 --> 14:38.209
In a rolling doughnut contest.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.612
That's true.
Wait, wait, caroline.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.046
Do we still have a shot
or not?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.281
No.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.816
Then better go hide
in the bathroom.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.484
I don't want this screwing up
my marriage.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.253
Both: What?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.821
Well, if you're not going
to be with me,

14:49.823 --> 14:51.923
I'm going to have to stay
with my wife.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.559
I mean, I'm a man.
I cannot be alone.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.894
Now, go, go, go.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.362
She cannot find you here
in our apartment.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.830
Why don't you just tell her
the truth,

14:58.832 --> 15:00.398
That nothing happened
between us?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.666
She will not believe me.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.901
I have a history.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.569
There are two of us here.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.906
I also have that history.

That's the least you can do
after ruining my life.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.813
Almost.
Almost ruined your life.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.048
Come on, max.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.350
This is totally inconvenient.

15:19.352 --> 15:23.121
My "c" better go up
to a "b."

15:26.759 --> 15:29.594
This is crazy, us hiding
in a married man's bathroom

15:29.596 --> 15:31.896
Like a couple of cheap floozies.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.098
So far, I'm just hearing
a factual depiction

15:34.100 --> 15:36.534
Of what's happening here.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.570
Let me see what's going on.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.974
[both speaking french]

15:45.678 --> 15:47.045
I can't understand them.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.379
I thought you spoke french.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.582
Only enough
to impress americans.

What should we do?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.327
Pretend we're hot plumbers?

16:02.329 --> 16:05.396
Hide in the shower.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.603
I think she might notice us.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.676
You know that's all glass,
right?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.545
Let me just get you
a clean hand towel.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.213
She has to pee-pee.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.848
She can't come in here
to use the toilet,

16:23.850 --> 16:26.384
'cause my life is in it.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.019
I know, this is unfortunate.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.320
So go out the window.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.122
What?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.024
It's not a problem.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.826
There's a ledge wide enough
for you to walk

16:34.828 --> 16:37.161
To the neighbor's terrace,
jump, and get away.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.197
Stephanie did it.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.832
Who's stephanie?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.800
That's...Not important.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.969
She's fine.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.072
Now go.
You have to go.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.907
Unless you think
you and I still have a shot.

16:49.909 --> 16:53.311
I'll be on the ledge.

Come on, max.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.584
No way, not happening, lucy.

his bad marriage,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.221
I'm responsible.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.556
Almost.
Almost responsible.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.492
Max, I wouldn't even be
in this situation

to put you

17:09.262 --> 17:10.561
Through pastry school.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.963
Oh, so this is my fault?

17:11.965 --> 17:15.033
Max, please just let it
be your fault.

17:20.072 --> 17:22.407
It's completely doable.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.176
By the way, it's raining.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.577
Come on.
We can do this.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.945
We've crawled 15 feet
on our roof

the hot plumber route.

If stephanie did it,
we can too.

all because of him.

of character.

This is bad.

any worse, unless we fall.

[whimpers]
I don't wanna die!

18:35.882 --> 18:37.482
Me neither!

18:37.484 --> 18:38.950
That's weird.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.284
For the first time
in my life,

18:40.286 --> 18:41.652
I don't want to die.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.454
I have a boyfriend
and my first "b."

18:43.456 --> 18:45.389
Oh, god, I'm getting soft!

18:45.391 --> 18:47.625
I can't die!
I haven't made my comeback yet.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.161
In my fantasy, you and I move
into that penthouse I bought

18:50.163 --> 18:51.562
From jennifer lawrence.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.066
Right over there,
with the roof garden, see?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.135
[screams]

18:59.872 --> 19:01.572
[screams]
are you two all right?

19:01.574 --> 19:05.643
I mean, whoever you are.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.879
Am I dead?

19:07.881 --> 19:10.915
Almost. Almost dead.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.323
Oh, my god.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.025
What happened to you two?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.693
Well, we crashed
through a window.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.495
It was pretty dope.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.030
It was kinda like
a  <i>die hard</i>movie,

19:26.032 --> 19:29.267
If they ever let girls do
cool stuff in those movies.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.868
The necks all right?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.204
We have whiplash, and I have
some bruises on my back.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.273
Max took the brunt of the fall
but feels nothing

19:35.275 --> 19:38.009
Because she's mostly made
of vicodin.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.877
Well, I'm glad you survived,

19:39.879 --> 19:41.779
Because I don't know
what I would do

19:41.781 --> 19:43.114
Without you around here.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.217
Aw, thanks, earl.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.953
[whispers]
I meant you.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.622
I know.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.591
Max, how were you
ever strong enough

19:53.593 --> 19:55.293
To hold me up
with one arm?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.594
It's the arm I used to drag
my mother

19:56.596 --> 19:59.630
Out of bars with
as a baby.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.033
Well, I want to say
something to you.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.702
I hope you know
that if you were the one

20:04.704 --> 20:06.437
That slipped on that ledge--

20:06.439 --> 20:09.640
I would be dead.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.377
Well, I'm glad that's
out in the open.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.612
Everybody!

20:14.614 --> 20:18.716
I have an update
about my life!

20:18.718 --> 20:19.951
Oh, whoa.

20:19.953 --> 20:21.719
What happened to you two?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.388
Sophie, we had an accident.
It's a long story.

20:24.390 --> 20:28.292
Yeah, all of yours are.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.560
<i>(sophie)</i>
<i>well,</i>

20:29.562 --> 20:31.996
I'm out of the movie business.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.899
I broke up with my bigwig
from miramax.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.667
We got in a huge fight,

20:36.669 --> 20:40.605
And he threw
his big wig at me.

20:40.607 --> 20:44.008
He told me I'd never eat lunch
in this town again.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.310
And I said, "hey,

20:46.312 --> 20:49.513
If I'm in town,
I'm eating lunch, baby!"

20:52.584 --> 20:54.352
Oh, no.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.255
No, no, no, I don't have
spider bites over half my body

20:57.257 --> 20:59.924
So you two could fake
another injury.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.192
Nice try.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.227
Oh!

21:03.229 --> 21:06.664
Ooh, I'll bet that hurts.
