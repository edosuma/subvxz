00:35.200 --> 00:37.400
- What about the rest?
- I'll come back after work.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.500
Well...I'm on call, so...

00:42.533 --> 00:44.473
I'll let myself in.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.470
I'm sorry.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.197
OK.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.097
Doctor?

01:55.133 --> 01:58.303
I'm having a wee,
for God's sake!

01:58.333 --> 02:00.003
Please don't raise
your voice to me.

02:01.367 --> 02:03.527
I'll be right out.

02:03.567 --> 02:04.627
Cow.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.767
I heard that and I'm writing
an incident form.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Sod it!

02:37.367 --> 02:39.397
Doctor?

02:39.433 --> 02:41.673
Dr Walker!

02:43.700 --> 02:44.770
Doctor?

03:38.567 --> 03:40.227
Dr Walker?

03:40.267 --> 03:41.797
Ruby. Everyone calls me Ruby.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.503
I'm AJ. Nice to meet you.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.673
Please. My car is over here.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.130
So it's your first time
in India?

03:59.167 --> 04:00.327
Sorry?

04:00.367 --> 04:03.127
Well, most people get dragged
back for a wedding or two.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.697
You know - distant cousins
they didn't even know.

04:05.733 --> 04:08.303
No cousins.
At least, I don't think so.

04:09.533 --> 04:12.503
I just needed to get away.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.073
From everything.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.370
Well, you've come to
the right place.

04:41.567 --> 04:43.727
- Does everyone drive like that?
- Not everyone.

04:43.767 --> 04:47.497
Hindus. We're fatalists.
If it's our day to die...

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
Where are you taking me?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.173
- What?
- Where are we?

05:05.633 --> 05:07.673
I think there's been a mistake.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.700
This is the wrong place.

05:09.733 --> 05:11.673
What do you mean?

05:15.467 --> 05:18.597
This is where I'm meant to be.
Dhoni Clinic.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.133
No. I was definitely told
to bring you here.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.533
And where is here, exactly?

05:25.567 --> 05:28.397
Well, it's er...Dr Fonseca's
Good Karma Hospital.

05:48.367 --> 05:49.697
Come on.

05:51.867 --> 05:55.597
This Dr Fonseca.
He's in charge?

05:55.633 --> 05:57.203
Er...officially, no.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.773
Unofficially, definitely yes.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
And er...he's a she.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.273
So maybe she can explain
what's going on.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.300
Where do I find her?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.333
Just follow the screaming.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
Excuse me, can I help you?

06:13.833 --> 06:16.033
It's only a dislocated shoulder.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.267
I'm in agony here.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.530
I'm running a public hospital
with no money.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.097
We all have problems.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.633
- What are you doing?
- Helping you.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.227
- You should give me morphine.
- Girlfriend?

06:25.267 --> 06:26.497
Yeah, yeah. We're engaged.

06:26.533 --> 06:29.433
Do you think a woman like that
wants to give her body to a man

06:29.467 --> 06:33.027
who screams because his shoulder
joint is a few inches out?

06:33.067 --> 06:35.727
Are you calling me a wimp?

06:35.767 --> 06:37.367
Remember.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.470
A real woman needs a man
who can take a little pain.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.000
And ride a moped.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.197
You're late.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.773
- How did you do that?
- Cunningham technique.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.470
Massaging the bicep muscle
reduces the spasm

06:52.500 --> 06:55.070
and allows the dislocation to
reduce spontaneously.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.630
No anaesthetic required
unless you're a total wimp.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.597
Also cheap,
efficient and effective.

06:59.633 --> 07:02.333
I'll teach you on the next idiot
who falls off his scooter.

07:02.367 --> 07:03.697
Straight ahead.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.033
In this hospital,
we use knowledge and skill,

07:06.067 --> 07:07.827
not fancy tests
and expensive drugs.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.327
You'll have to learn that
if you want to work here.

07:10.367 --> 07:14.267
Sorry, Doctor Fonseca.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.200
I'll be honest with you,
Dr Walker.

07:16.233 --> 07:19.073
The last thing my hospital needs
is a lazy British doctor

07:19.100 --> 07:21.530
with no experience
and an attitude problem.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.667
This is real life,
not a gap-year experience.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.530
My patients
are not dinner party stories.

07:25.567 --> 07:28.797
Frankly, that's quite insulting.
And it's not why I'm here.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.403
- Then why are you here?
- It's complicated.

07:31.433 --> 07:34.233
Naturally. But is it original?
Or interesting?

07:34.267 --> 07:35.497
No.

07:35.533 --> 07:36.733
Pity.

07:36.767 --> 07:39.197
The point is,
I'm not supposed to be here.

07:39.233 --> 07:42.173
This is the wrong hospital.
I applied for the Dhoni Clinic.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.570
As did everyone else
but the rules changed.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.570
For some reason,
all our new graduates

07:46.600 --> 07:47.700
prefer to stay on the teat

07:47.733 --> 07:50.473
rather than spread their tiny
wings in the real world.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.430
So now all new doctors must
spend a compulsory year

07:53.467 --> 07:55.567
at a public hospital,
no exceptions.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.470
So I'm stuck here
for a year?

07:58.500 --> 08:01.170
You say that like it's a bad
thing, Dr Walker. This way.

08:04.433 --> 08:07.103
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.773
This is Dr Walker.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.600
Another half-trained
British doctor

08:10.633 --> 08:12.303
to practise on Indian people.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.333
Don't be racist, Lydia.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.597
Dr Nair, our nominal chief

08:16.633 --> 08:20.433
and the human raincloud
in the corner is Dr Varma.

08:20.467 --> 08:24.067
I believe you've already met my
son, AJ, our ambulance driver.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.230
- You didn't have to...
- No problem at all.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.267
Milk, sugar? Or both?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
Both, please.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.232
You'll soon come
to the conclusion

08:33.267 --> 08:36.427
that I make the best tea

08:36.467 --> 08:40.267
and the wisest decisions
around here.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.130
I believe your previous post
was paediatrics?

08:43.167 --> 08:44.467
Yes, that's right.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.430
I thought we were getting
another surgeon.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.027
What happened to Dr Pradeep?

08:48.067 --> 08:50.267
Recruited elsewhere.
We get what we're given.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.300
I'm sure Dr Walker is a willing
student. You can teach her.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.533
I'm not really a surgeon.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.767
Simple butchery with a little
light needlework thrown in.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.270
Round here we turn our hands
to most things.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.470
Right, housekeeping.
We're almost out of amoxicillin.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.100
So I catch anyone giving it
for a viral throat,

09:06.133 --> 09:08.633
they'll need emergency surgery
themselves.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.497
They're still reporting cholera
east of Munnar.

09:11.533 --> 09:13.533
15 new cases,
so eyes open, please.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.027
I don't want it here.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.427
And that's it. Welcome to
the Good Karma Hospital.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.197
Yeah... No, well...

09:31.233 --> 09:33.403
Can you just double check,
because...

09:33.433 --> 09:37.303
No, no, I understand that,
the point is that...

09:37.333 --> 09:39.333
No, no, no,
don't put me on hold.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.667
That's all very well but...

09:41.700 --> 09:43.630
Can I at least just talk to her?

09:43.667 --> 09:46.167
Because this isn't
what I signed up for.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.403
Hello?

09:52.700 --> 09:53.730
Sorry.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.100
Whatever it is,
we deal with it -

09:58.133 --> 10:00.533
surgery, medical, dental.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.227
I'm not a dentist.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.567
It's easier than it looks.
Just ask Mari for the pliers.

10:13.233 --> 10:15.133
Well, at least
we're not too busy.

10:15.167 --> 10:17.167
I suppose we've only
just opened.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.070
What, this?
This isn't the waiting room.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.100
This is just admissions.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.473
Come.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.027
This is the waiting room.

10:53.267 --> 10:57.227
Soon I shall be a man.
Then we can marry.

10:57.267 --> 10:59.267
What makes you think
I'll say yes?

10:59.300 --> 11:01.370
I'm very charming.
And once I'm rich,

11:01.400 --> 11:04.570
you will no longer have to work
in a terrible place like this.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.670
Unless you're promised
to another?

11:06.700 --> 11:09.130
No. Right now, I'm all yours.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.230
- Sorry. Did that hurt?
- Of course not.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.797
Your friend?

11:15.833 --> 11:18.673
Brother. Sanjay.
He's just a kid.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.830
You still haven't told me
who did this to you.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.027
A jealous man caught me
making love to his wife.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.667
But now I have found you,

11:24.700 --> 11:27.300
I promise to never even look
at another woman

11:27.333 --> 11:30.033
as long as I live.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.627
Just promise me you'll be
more careful next time.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.597
- Yes, I will.
- OK.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.030
She's barely out of
medical school.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.027
Beggars can't be choosers.
She seems keen enough.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.727
Well, I can't supervise her.
Also I'm on call today.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.497
I'm sure you'll manage.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.733
Think of her as the childhood
hamster you never had,

11:51.767 --> 11:54.467
fragile and easily crushed -
it'll be good for you.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.400
- Our patients deserve better.
- I couldn't agree more.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.603
But in life, few of us get
what we deserve.

12:00.633 --> 12:02.673
Help her rise to the challenge,
Dr Varma.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.167
You had a serious head injury.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.570
- You can't be alone tonight.
- I have Sanjay.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.270
I meant a responsible adult.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.130
Then I should stay at your place
tonight?

12:19.167 --> 12:21.167
- Nice try. No.
- Dinner, then?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.530
- You never give up, do you?
- How can I? I'm in love.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.267
Until the day I die.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.400
Which might be sooner
than you think.

12:28.433 --> 12:31.533
Come on. Out. Out. Come on.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.367
I could have handled him.
He's only a kid.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.230
A kid who'll sell drugs
to anyone who'll buy them.

12:40.267 --> 12:43.427
Why do you think
they beat him up?

12:43.467 --> 12:46.367
Doctor! Doctor!
My wife requires your attention.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.070
Come here. Straight ahead.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.730
You can relax, yeah?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.333
Doctor.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.567
Now I assume you have delivered
a baby before?

13:04.600 --> 13:08.200
Sure. I mean, it's been a few
years since I did it myself,

13:08.233 --> 13:10.833
and I was supervised,
obviously, but I think...

13:10.867 --> 13:13.667
She's only at three centimetres.
So it'll be a while yet.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.770
Check every hour.
Call me when she's at ten.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.430
Doctor?

13:17.467 --> 13:18.497
Yes?

13:18.533 --> 13:21.673
Are you quite sure
that everything is all right?

13:21.700 --> 13:24.400
Your wife is in perfect health.

13:24.433 --> 13:27.603
Everything points to a normal,
uncomplicated delivery, yeah?

13:29.667 --> 13:32.367
So I'll call you when it's time
and you'll come back?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.330
Was that a yes or a...

13:41.133 --> 13:42.703
So...I'm Dr Walker.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.733
I'll be looking after you
from now on.

13:44.767 --> 13:45.697
You're English?

13:45.733 --> 13:49.133
Fresh off the boat.
It's my first day.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.097
But don't worry.
Not a problem.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.573
We have babies in England too.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.700
So have you got a name
worked out?

13:57.733 --> 13:59.733
Or is it wait and see?

13:59.767 --> 14:03.067
Raja, after his father.
Our first boy.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.403
Well, I can't wait to meet him.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.303
How long have you known me?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.633
I don't like surprises
and I have work to do.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.267
So this better be good.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.130
Trust me, Lydia, I'm convinced
that this could be

14:22.167 --> 14:25.327
the perfect answer for our
long-standing financial worries.

14:25.367 --> 14:28.667
I'm... I'm sure
you will thank me later.

14:37.767 --> 14:40.567
Dr Fonseca.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.400
Your timing, like your bedside
manner, is faultless.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.473
What are you up to?

14:47.500 --> 14:50.600
Your lack of trust hurts me,
Lydia.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.203
This way.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.700
Under this humble tarpaulin

15:02.733 --> 15:06.573
is a ground-breaking example
of medicine and business

15:06.600 --> 15:09.230
working together
in perfect harmony.

15:09.267 --> 15:10.427
Just show me.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.033
I am a doctor! I run a hospital!

15:23.067 --> 15:24.827
How can I advertise a bar?

15:24.867 --> 15:27.197
Especially one owned
by a petty criminal!

15:27.233 --> 15:30.103
I resent that slander
and demand a retraction.

15:30.133 --> 15:33.403
You have used my face without
permission. That's slander.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.433
I'm sorry. I should have
listened to Ram.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.797
He said you looked jowly
and I ignored him.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.673
- Greg!
- You! I blame you for this.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.670
Wait. Wait.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.200
Greg has agreed
to sponsor the ambulance.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.273
The fuel, the repairs...

15:47.300 --> 15:49.170
- Tyres.
- Yes, the tyres.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.500
And in return, all he requires
is a little bit of publicity.

15:52.533 --> 15:56.073
People round here trust you.
You're a brand, Lydia.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.770
No photo, no deal.

16:00.367 --> 16:01.497
No.

16:01.533 --> 16:04.103
No. 1,000 times, no.

16:04.133 --> 16:05.473
And that's your final word?

16:05.500 --> 16:08.430
Believe me, neither of you want
to hear my final word.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.273
Well, that went well.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.270
Everything all right?

16:15.300 --> 16:18.130
The baby's about to crown.
You're progressing quickly.

16:18.167 --> 16:20.597
Mari, can you go and fetch
Dr Varma, quickly?

16:20.633 --> 16:22.633
- Doctor?
- OK, Nita.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.827
Just let me know when
you're ready to push, OK?

16:29.167 --> 16:30.597
That works.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.627
- You have a reservation?
- I'm the doctor.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.867
Yes. Of course, please.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.070
Mum, don't try and get up.
You're better lying down.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.370
And I'm telling you, I'm fine.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.300
For God's sake, Maggie,
just lie down.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.733
Look, here's the doctor.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.196
In the middle of the ceremony,
she just collapsed.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.673
- We called immediately.
- There's no hotel doctor?

17:06.700 --> 17:09.300
He's sick. Food poisoning.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.673
It's fine.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.770
We were almost done
and dusted, anyway.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.730
Besides, we're in India.
Where's he gonna run off to?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.200
Before you say anything,

17:19.233 --> 17:21.703
I fainted.

17:21.733 --> 17:24.303
We don't get heat like this
in Stourbridge.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.403
And now I'm being killed
by fuss.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.703
I'm Dr Varma.
I need to examine you.

17:29.733 --> 17:30.973
I promise it won't take long.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.100
Good. We're paying for that
bleeding elephant by the hour.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.403
Dad!

17:38.800 --> 17:40.630
Dr Varma is out on call.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.827
I can't find anyone.

17:42.867 --> 17:45.527
What do you mean?
There has to be someone.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.367
No one.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.800
OK.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.803
OK. We're fine.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.403
Really, really fine.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.033
What are you doing?

17:55.067 --> 17:57.227
The baby is coming.
You need to be prepared.

17:58.667 --> 17:59.767
OK, Nita.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.730
You're going to feel another
contraction any second.

18:02.767 --> 18:06.627
When it comes, I need you
to push for me, OK?

18:06.667 --> 18:09.397
Now! Push! Push!

18:09.433 --> 18:10.773
Come on!

18:12.567 --> 18:15.467
- What's the matter?
- Everything's fine.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.670
It concerns me that
you keep saying that.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.070
Now is the time to fetch the
real doctor, Dr Varma.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.300
I'm a real doctor.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.503
With great respect, I would
prefer someone else in charge.

18:24.533 --> 18:27.373
- Dr Varma...
- Isn't here. So you've got me.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.273
Shit.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.570
I can see the cord.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.200
- The cord's prolapsing.
- What are you doing?

18:35.233 --> 18:37.533
The baby's head is pressing on
the umbilical cord.

18:37.567 --> 18:40.297
I need to support the head
or the baby will suffocate.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.303
Another contraction?
Now listen to me.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.273
This baby
needs to come out this time.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.470
- OK, no more messing around.
- I understand.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.730
Ready?

18:49.767 --> 18:51.667
Push! Now! Push!

18:51.700 --> 18:54.830
Push! Don't you dare stop!
Keep pushing!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.327
Push! Push! Push!

18:58.667 --> 19:00.597
OK.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.403
And here we are.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.597
Doctor?

19:14.633 --> 19:18.633
You have a girl.
You have a beautiful baby girl.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.427
You performed
the ultrasound scan.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.567
You told me my wife
was carrying a son.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.770
Is that true? You know the law
as well as I do.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.670
There were medical concerns.
Foetal movements reduced.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.500
- Even so...
- You lied!

19:56.533 --> 19:59.303
You knew if the baby
had been a girl, we'd have...

19:59.333 --> 20:02.473
You would have what?

20:02.500 --> 20:05.730
You understand me, Dr Nair.
I already have three daughters.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.767
All need to be married.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.800
I'm not a rich man.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.573
It is hard enough for me to
provide for the children I have.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.800
It's a healthy baby, Mr Mehta.

20:15.833 --> 20:18.033
A gift from Krishna himself,
surely?

20:20.533 --> 20:21.833
It's quite simple.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.027
Nita Mehta
was bleeding profusely

20:24.067 --> 20:26.097
and needed an ultrasound scan.

20:26.133 --> 20:28.773
Her husband wanted to know
the sex and I refused.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.530
And then he as good as told me

20:30.567 --> 20:33.067
that unless he found out,
they'd have an abortion

20:33.100 --> 20:34.700
because he couldn't risk
another girl.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.573
- So you told him the sex...
- I was manipulated...

20:37.600 --> 20:38.770
Which is illegal.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.770
He thought he could see
an appendage.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.430
And you didn't correct him?

20:42.467 --> 20:45.027
Do you know how small a penis is
at 12 weeks?

20:45.067 --> 20:48.467
You've put the hospital at risk.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.770
Do you think we can afford
legal action over this?

20:51.800 --> 20:54.030
The Government
could close us down!

20:54.067 --> 20:55.497
And rightly so!

21:12.100 --> 21:14.370
Now, has this happened before?

21:14.400 --> 21:17.270
What, fainting? Never.

21:18.367 --> 21:21.027
Like I said, must be this heat.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.997
No, I don't think so. Erm...

21:24.500 --> 21:27.670
I'm afraid I suspect
you've had a seizure.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.030
An epileptic fit.

21:31.067 --> 21:34.327
Now if this is the first time
it's happened,

21:34.367 --> 21:37.297
we'll have to take you to
hospital for further tests.

21:38.433 --> 21:41.573
There's no need...and no time.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.497
I have a brain tumour.

21:53.067 --> 21:56.067
I can't believe he walked
out on his baby like that.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.370
Family planning
is a big deal round here.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.130
Any child is a blessing.

22:00.167 --> 22:03.097
Back home, people try for years,
pay thousands for IVF.

22:03.133 --> 22:06.573
And there's thousands of rupees
worth of dowry playing there.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.700
Raja Mehta runs his own
business. Taxi firm.

22:09.733 --> 22:12.573
He works every hour God sends
to provide for his family.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.170
No benefits. No help.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.570
He needed a son.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.030
Sometimes good men
get desperate.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.530
Mari told me what happened.

22:22.567 --> 22:25.197
You were left on your own and
you saved that baby's life.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.273
Well done.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.370
But although I appreciate
an independent spirit,

22:29.400 --> 22:31.370
Dr Varma
should have assisted you.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.730
I think he was called away.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.527
Important business, no doubt.

22:46.133 --> 22:48.773
Our daughter's wedding.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.170
It should be the proudest day
of his life.

22:52.533 --> 22:54.333
How could I tell him?

22:54.367 --> 22:55.667
Nobody knows?

23:02.367 --> 23:04.797
Anticonvulsants.

23:04.833 --> 23:07.333
They should prevent
any further seizures.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.003
I'm sure you simply fainted.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.700
The midday sun can be fierce.

23:15.733 --> 23:17.673
Perhaps some kind of hat?

23:19.467 --> 23:21.827
Thank you.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.997
If I were your husband,
I'd want to know.

23:27.267 --> 23:30.297
If you were my husband,
we wouldn't be talking.

23:33.667 --> 23:36.097
- So when do the shifts swap?
- They don't.

23:36.133 --> 23:37.633
So when do I finish?

23:37.667 --> 23:40.197
Whenever you like,
as long as the board is empty.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.333
I don't get it.

23:41.367 --> 23:44.027
No one leaves until the board is
empty. Are you up to it?

23:44.067 --> 23:45.997
Take a seat, please.

24:49.267 --> 24:50.527
Herr Muller?

24:53.533 --> 24:55.473
If you'd like to follow me.

25:27.633 --> 25:29.133
Hey.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.100
Ssh, ssh.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.433
She's so beautiful.
Then I suppose all babies are.

25:38.467 --> 25:40.467
Even the ugly ones...

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
not that your baby is ugly.

25:42.533 --> 25:45.233
I mean...
You know what I mean.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.630
All babies are born beautiful.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.430
Not all are born equal.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.100
Hey... Sssh.

26:02.467 --> 26:03.767
Doctor?

26:03.800 --> 26:07.170
Has she been feeding OK?
She's a little pale.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.603
There's a VSD.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.803
Pulmonary valve
is severely stenosed.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.027
She has Fallot's Tetralogy.

26:18.067 --> 26:20.567
Your baby has a severe
congenital heart defect.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.500
The attacks come and go

26:22.533 --> 26:25.573
but she'll need
specialist help soon.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.230
And if not?

26:27.267 --> 26:29.197
Then your baby will die.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.270
Perhaps, if that's God's will,
then...

26:41.300 --> 26:44.270
I will speak to my husband.
He'll know what to do.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.570
I know it's a tragedy
but if they refuse permission,

26:52.600 --> 26:54.600
then there's little else
we can do.

26:54.633 --> 26:57.133
- But if it was a boy...
- The cost will still ruin them.

26:57.167 --> 27:00.497
You did your best. Sometimes
that's all any of us can manage.

27:00.533 --> 27:02.133
We can't just accept it.

27:02.167 --> 27:05.327
Believe me, Dr Walker,
I'm a huge fan of conflict,

27:05.367 --> 27:09.527
but a wise general only fights
when she's sure to win the day.

27:09.567 --> 27:11.827
We wait for our opportunity.

27:11.867 --> 27:14.297
The real trick is to know it
when you see it.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.497
Come on, then!

27:16.533 --> 27:18.573
Or are you gonna sleep here
all night?

27:23.167 --> 27:25.797
Right, here we are.

27:25.833 --> 27:28.103
This is the hospital
accommodation?

27:28.133 --> 27:31.203
I know. Quite disgusting.
I can only apologise.

27:41.067 --> 27:44.227
There's a fridge in the kitchen
stocked with bare essentials.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.367
Thanks.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.170
You travel light, Dr Walker.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.830
Nothing else wanted
to come with me.

27:50.867 --> 27:53.797
More fool them.

27:53.833 --> 27:56.373
You haven't thought about him
all day, have you?

27:56.400 --> 27:57.800
How did you know?

27:57.833 --> 28:01.373
There's always a man,
in my experience.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.330
Neither interesting
nor original.

29:19.167 --> 29:20.997
I've got something to tell you.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.833
At last. I thought you were
never coming home.

30:37.867 --> 30:41.027
Yeah, well,
my patients needed me.

30:41.067 --> 30:43.497
Dr Fonseca,
you are truly indispensable.

30:43.533 --> 30:45.673
I've decided I want my key back.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.030
Don't let a silly little
sponsored ambulance

30:48.067 --> 30:49.467
come between us.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.200
Firstly, there is no "us".

30:51.233 --> 30:53.703
This is merely a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.503
Which I am currently
reconsidering.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.073
- So, shoo!
- OK.

30:58.267 --> 31:00.097
What do you want?

31:00.133 --> 31:01.273
Dignity.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.730
Trumped by hard cash
every time.

31:03.767 --> 31:05.267
No picture.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.630
There is literally no amount of
money you can pay me

31:07.667 --> 31:09.097
to make me change my mind.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.433
- I need my brand.
- Then I will need my bed back.

31:11.467 --> 31:12.627
Immediately.

31:14.067 --> 31:18.097
So, if I agree...

31:18.133 --> 31:20.503
..our mutually beneficial
arrangement...

31:22.167 --> 31:24.527
Can be renegotiated
in good faith.

31:24.567 --> 31:28.197
- Immediately?
- I don't see why not.

31:28.233 --> 31:32.403
In that case, Dr Fonseca,
you've got yourself a deal.

31:54.567 --> 31:56.797
Let me through, I'm a doctor!
Let me through!

31:56.833 --> 31:58.073
No.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.300
Atul, can you hear me?
Come on.

32:01.633 --> 32:04.173
Atul.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.270
Sanjay?

32:05.300 --> 32:08.570
OK, just hold it down.
Hold it down over his cuts.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.730
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.730
Someone call an ambulance now!
What are you waiting for?

32:23.667 --> 32:25.097
Sanjay?

32:26.233 --> 32:27.633
He's OK.

32:27.667 --> 32:31.067
I told you...I'd see you again.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.530
They're both unstable.
They need theatre now.

32:41.567 --> 32:43.797
We only have
one operating theatre.

32:43.833 --> 32:45.833
Which one? Who goes first?

32:45.867 --> 32:47.497
I don't know.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.673
What do you want to do, Doctor?
Come on!

32:52.267 --> 32:55.197
Sanjay. Take Sanjay first,
his wounds are more severe.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.603
He's been attacked.
Stab wounds to the abdomen.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.073
God preserve us.

33:08.100 --> 33:10.200
- And the other one?
- His brother, Atul.

33:10.233 --> 33:12.733
Multiple stab wounds to the
abdomen. He's holding BP at 80.

33:12.767 --> 33:15.297
Dr Varma's on his way. Make
the boy as stable as you can.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.333
OK.

33:17.733 --> 33:19.603
More IV.

33:34.067 --> 33:36.267
Damn. He's too shut down.
I need another.

33:43.133 --> 33:45.633
I can't find a vein.

33:45.667 --> 33:49.027
16-year-old male, stab wound to
abdomen. Completely shut down.

33:49.067 --> 33:50.467
Cut down set, now.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.030
If you can't get access,
you do a cut down...IO.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.527
Large bore cannula -
Spencer Wells.

34:10.433 --> 34:13.803
No. No, O negative. He needs
blood, not saline. Quick!

34:19.500 --> 34:21.000
Come on, Dr Walker.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.330
He's clotting up
rather more easily now.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.330
Still asystole.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.700
Doctor...

35:13.733 --> 35:15.633
Dr Walker.

36:34.467 --> 36:37.467
Adequate IV access.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.230
Rapid volume replacement
and high-flow oxygen.

36:40.267 --> 36:41.567
I'm sorry.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.800
O negative should have been
running immediately.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.103
He was too shut down.

36:45.133 --> 36:46.733
A real surgeon
can deal with that.

36:46.767 --> 36:48.397
- A cut down, I/O access...
- Enough.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.267
You told me to teach her.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.230
I said, that's enough.

36:59.533 --> 37:02.803
You know, just have
your holiday if you want.

37:02.833 --> 37:06.433
Just don't get in the way
of the real doctors.

37:06.467 --> 37:08.227
OK?

38:29.533 --> 38:31.533
I've just checked Sanjay Nadar.

38:31.567 --> 38:34.397
Drains are running clear
already. He should do well.

38:34.433 --> 38:36.103
The police have been informed.

38:36.133 --> 38:39.733
His brother's body has been
released to the coroner.

38:39.767 --> 38:43.567
We did the best we could
in a very difficult situation.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.530
All of us.

38:46.733 --> 38:48.733
Right. I think that's enough.

38:48.767 --> 38:50.697
You all know
what you have to do.

39:12.067 --> 39:13.267
Horrible beasts!

39:13.300 --> 39:16.070
Know how many pathogens there
are on a single monkey hair?

39:17.233 --> 39:18.533
Er...no.

39:18.567 --> 39:21.297
Tens of millions...probably.

39:23.133 --> 39:25.733
- So, what?
- Sorry?

39:25.767 --> 39:28.397
You're sitting here alone.
Your bag is packed.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.373
There must be a so.

39:31.733 --> 39:35.373
So...I don't think
I can do this.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.400
And what is this, exactly?

39:37.433 --> 39:40.473
Leaving England, thinking
I could work here and...

39:40.500 --> 39:43.070
Just the whole
being a doctor thing.

39:43.100 --> 39:46.730
I see.
Then that is a problem.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.767
Would it help to throw
a stone at a monkey?

39:49.800 --> 39:51.400
You're laughing at me.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.073
Suit yourself.

40:01.433 --> 40:04.703
A young boy lost his life
and we couldn't save him.

40:04.733 --> 40:07.203
- We, not you.
- Dr Varma...

40:07.233 --> 40:08.733
His injuries were too severe.

40:08.767 --> 40:12.397
There was nothing you, Dr Varma
or Ganesh could have done.

40:12.433 --> 40:14.273
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

40:14.300 --> 40:16.300
Because you, unlike Dr Varma,

40:16.333 --> 40:18.573
are still a fully-functioning
human being.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.000
When you lose that feeling,
it really is time to go home.

40:24.367 --> 40:27.267
People come to India to find
themselves, Dr Walker.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.500
The truth is, most of them
are simply idiots.

40:29.533 --> 40:32.603
But you...
You do look a little lost.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.433
But something tells me

40:34.467 --> 40:37.067
there's someone in there
worth discovering.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.330
And as for being a good doctor,

40:38.367 --> 40:40.667
you might not be the best
but you're the best I've got.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.530
So I'm not letting you leave.

40:42.567 --> 40:44.597
I'm not sure
resigning works that way.

40:44.633 --> 40:48.233
Sometimes we all just...
overcomplicate things.

40:48.267 --> 40:51.067
Especially when
we're too emotional.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.800
I don't think Dr Varma
wants me back.

40:52.833 --> 40:56.773
Ha! Believe me, he needs you
much more than you need him.

40:58.367 --> 41:01.197
Now get back to work.

41:01.233 --> 41:04.403
And if you ever miss
morning report again,

41:04.433 --> 41:06.203
consider yourself fired.

42:28.533 --> 42:30.773
And if we don't have
the operation?

42:30.800 --> 42:33.200
Then your child
will remain very sick.

42:33.233 --> 42:37.303
Things could only get worse.
She needs this surgery.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.203
Of course, the choice is yours.

42:40.233 --> 42:41.703
Dr Walker?

43:29.700 --> 43:34.230
The wisdom of Solomon,
Dr Walker. I'm impressed.

43:34.267 --> 43:37.197
Sometimes,
old stories are the best.

43:39.100 --> 43:40.430
Thank you.

43:40.467 --> 43:42.397
She has a name now - Ruby.

43:44.667 --> 43:46.597
I asked Dr Fonseca.

43:50.267 --> 43:51.767
Don't get too cocky.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.700
There are 17 Lydias
from here to Kochi.

43:54.733 --> 43:56.733
And four of them are boys.

44:02.733 --> 44:05.633
Come along, Dr Walker.
We have work to do.
