How's it going with julian?

00:43.060 --> 00:45.880
Oh, you know, good cop, bad coP.

00:46.230 --> 00:50.320
I'm, fighting the urge from tying him to 
a chair and beating him to death.

00:51.650 --> 00:54.300
Hey, what's the deal with this dove pendant?

00:54.430 --> 00:55.820
I've never seen you wear iT.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.890

Mm. It's nice. All right, so, 
are you gonna be home late?

01:04.250 --> 01:05.980
Maybe. I don't know.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.340
I'll tell you what -- I'll give you a call 
if it's looking like that, okay?

01:08.480 --> 01:09.510
Okay. 

01:10.080 --> 01:11.690
Well, I'll be up writing.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.720
Hey, and just be careful. 
It's kind of nasty out there.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.880
Not ready you lose you yet, you knuckle head.

01:18.070 --> 01:20.900
You're the knuckle head. All right, get back to work.

01:21.020 --> 01:23.320
Mama needs the money. Bye, baby.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.760
Bye.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.940
 The way it goes --  one in, one out.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.250
 Sam?

02:34.070 --> 02:36.000
and everyone knows except for jim.

02:36.860 --> 02:41.010
You know, mouth, discretion might 
serve us better tonight, don't you think?

02:47.420 --> 02:48.340
Oh, I'm sure you are.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.490
It's bigger than the column.

02:49.910 --> 02:51.230
You look gooD.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.550
It's gonna shake up this whole town.

Problems with men,problems with money.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.180
You could help me with botH.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.130
Nice dress.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.970
Do you like it? I made it myself.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.520
Now, how about my problems?

03:30.640 --> 03:33.100
Uhyou know I never mix business with pleasure.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.480
Just pleasure, then?

03:36.690 --> 03:38.470
I have karen's cafe now.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.080
She's all the lady I need.

03:40.190 --> 03:41.490
I'm sorry, brooke.

03:41.590 --> 03:43.670
Now,if you'll excuse mE...

03:44.900 --> 03:47.180
you'll be back.

03:52.770 --> 03:54.300
Nice shot.

03:56.510 --> 03:58.620
You're gonna be a hard man to replace.

03:59.270 --> 04:01.620
And how's the search for my repcement coming?

04:01.730 --> 04:04.470
Well, it'd be a lot easier if I knew when I was losing yoU.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.610
When I know, you'll know.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.380
You rented out my room upstairs yet?

04:08.480 --> 04:09.460
Nope.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.430
It'll be waiting for you when you get back.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.150
Hey, uh, shouldn't haley be on by now?

04:18.430 --> 04:20.149
Let's give her a minutE.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.770
 ...That we will not only defend  
ourselves to the uttermost,

04:30.890 --> 04:34.070
 but will make it very certain  

04:34.260 --> 04:40.360
that this form of treachery  shall never again endanger uS.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.250
 Hostilities exisT...

04:43.620 --> 04:45.150
yes, they do.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.810
What are you doing here?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.930
Oh, I'm just checking up on my singer.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.500
I'm not your anything.

04:54.170 --> 04:57.230
Is that any way to speak to the man 
who gave you everything?

04:57.340 --> 04:58.930
Set you up in his club?

04:59.070 --> 05:01.380
Saved you from being in a traveling sideshow?

05:01.490 --> 05:05.290
And yet you leave the comet club for karen's cafe?

05:06.140 --> 05:07.540
I want you back.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.720
Oh, still feisty.I like that.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.370
Listen, mister, if you think 
I'm going back to that hellhole,

05:12.450 --> 05:13.920
- you've got another thing coming. 
- Hellhole, is it?

05:14.020 --> 05:15.720
- Yes, hellhole. 
-  The classiest joint within 100 miles, and you know it.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.840
- Classy? Classy, my foot. 
- Who do you think you are?

05:17.950 --> 05:20.080
- Dorothy dandridge? Those good old boys 
never cared about my voice

05:20.180 --> 05:21.450
as long as they could see my legs 
and my chest hiked up to my ears.

05:21.550 --> 05:24.500
- I'll never go back, and that's final. 
- You know what? I decide what's final!

05:28.270 --> 05:30.330
Oh, so that's what it's like?

05:30.600 --> 05:32.320
You are -- ugh!

05:33.170 --> 05:35.250
One of these days, someone's gonna stand up to you, 

05:35.340 --> 05:37.460
dan scott,and I, for one, can't wait.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.000
Sing me something sweet tonight, doll.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.150
I'll be watching.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.830
Break a leg.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.930
Ladies and gentlemen,it is my greatest pleasure

05:53.050 --> 05:55.390
 to bring to this stage for your entertainment

05:55.500 --> 05:59.750
only at karen's cafe?-- miss haley james.

07:08.580 --> 07:09.840
 what a dame.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.840
She gets 'em every time.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.340
You ever thinka girl like that and...

07:15.650 --> 07:17.050
never mind.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.620
A bartender like you?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.540
Yeah, why not?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.770
Well, 'cause I'm a nobody.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.830
she's definitely a somebody.

07:26.930 --> 07:28.450
Never say never, nate.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.130
Look, if you want something,go get it.It's that simple.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.190
What do you want, luke?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.450
NothinG.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.460
Got everything I want right here.

07:49.610 --> 07:52.820
Luke...we have a problem.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.350
I'll take care of it.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.860
Move it or lose it, folks.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.700
well, well,miss brooke davis.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.570
You have the money you borrowed from me?

08:33.169 --> 08:35.710
Not yet, but I have something in the works.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.159
Not yet?

08:37.280 --> 08:40.580
Well, that's a mighty expensive champagne 
I saw you drinking over there.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.510
Well, a lady has to keep up appearances.

08:43.620 --> 08:46.310
Well, your appearance is gonna suffer 
if you don't get me my money.

08:57.530 --> 08:58.680
can I help you?

08:58.800 --> 09:01.780
Wow, lucas scott.What a pleasure.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.430
You know, I actually thought this was my club for a while,

09:04.570 --> 09:06.440
considering that's my singer up there.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.630
Oh, I'm sorry to inform you,but your club's down the road.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.170
It's the one lacking customers.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.320
Funny.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.840
Give me my girl back, and I'll consider letting you live.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.940
Haley's free to do whatever she wants,

09:22.060 --> 09:23.610
and she wants to stay here.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.290
Now, you, on the other hand,are free to go.

09:28.790 --> 09:31.840
You know,this club had such an elegance when your mom ran it.

09:31.970 --> 09:35.290
I remember being treated with such respect.

09:35.970 --> 09:39.130
And sometimes I was treated to a few other thingS.

09:39.270 --> 09:43.700
It's too bad your mom ran off after 
that horrible accident with keith.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.570
I mean,she was always so......

09:48.150 --> 09:50.190
Hospitable.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.670
I think it's time for you to get out of my club..

09:52.820 --> 09:54.850
or I will throw you out.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.430
Julian?

09:57.650 --> 09:59.360
Dan!

10:00.020 --> 10:01.910
That's enough for tonight.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.300
Thanks for a lovely evening.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.450
Sorry,ladies and gentlemen.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.650
A round on the house. Haley james.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.840
Oh, hey,good to see you.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.250
Check out those gams.

11:17.350 --> 11:18.460
Hey, not tonight,all right?

11:18.560 --> 11:19.900
- Oh, let's have us a dance.
- Listen, get off.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.960
- Oh, come on, give me some sugar. 
- Get off!

11:23.660 --> 11:25.630
Gary enough for you?

11:26.870 --> 11:28.430
You okay?

11:28.530 --> 11:30.810
Thank you, but maybe you should cut that guy off.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.240
Maybe I should buy him another drink on the house.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.890
And why would you do that?

11:35.040 --> 11:38.480
'Cause he gave the bartender an excuse to the gorgeous singer

11:46.660 --> 11:49.380
you know, in that case,maybe you should give him two.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.720
The second one's from me.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.200
Julian,give us a moment.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.700
Your mother made me promise one thing before she died --

12:16.420 --> 12:19.530
- that I would always look after you. 
- I know.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.230
I saw you making eyes at lucas tonight.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.540
I was doing nothing of the sort.

12:28.770 --> 12:31.530
I know what I saw.Don't make a liar out of me.

12:38.610 --> 12:40.400
Go to bed.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.390
I believe you, peyton.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.270
I know you only have eyes for me.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.560
Sweet dreams.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.880
Oh, I think I had a few too many tonight.

13:06.990 --> 13:09.140
Oh, you have a few too many every night, mouth --

13:09.240 --> 13:11.760
keeping me in business. 
Now, are you gonna be okay to get home?

13:11.870 --> 13:13.430
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.650
- I'm going places, luke.
- I know.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.330
Which way am I going?

13:21.440 --> 13:23.130
Thanks, pal.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.340
I used to be great, luke.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.810
I was the best reporter in tree hill city.

13:27.930 --> 13:29.890
But I'm working on something big.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.340
I'm telling you --no more gossip columns for me.

13:32.450 --> 13:33.900
It's big, luke. 

13:34.020 --> 13:37.000
They'll see.They'll all see me again.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.600
Does anybody see me here?

13:45.010 --> 13:46.420
Have a good night.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.290
Last chance.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.990
Good night, brooke.

13:53.290 --> 13:57.370
And, brooke,those were nice days we had.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.170
Sure they were.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.500
Sorry I had to break your heart.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.570
Are you sure you can still handle your whiskey, luke?

14:08.680 --> 14:09.790
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

14:09.900 --> 14:12.660
'Cause you just let brooke davis walk out 
of here without paying her tab.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.190
I've been working with you 10 years,

14:17.300 --> 14:19.560
and I've never seen you tear up a bar tab before.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.750
She's just down on her luck.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.680
Mark my word, skills --

14:23.820 --> 14:27.000
someday, brooke davis is gonna change the world.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.550
Taxi!

14:41.840 --> 14:43.680
On second thought, I'll walk.

14:43.810 --> 14:45.480
Thanks.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.780
Sir?

14:53.270 --> 14:55.050
Have a good night.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.420
Nice night for a walk.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.120
I told you I don't have your money yet.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.280
Oh, that's a damn shame, 

15:14.410 --> 15:16.830
'cause, you see,I'm a businessman,
so when I make an investment,

15:16.940 --> 15:18.920
I expect to see a return on that investment.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.510
I spent it on the start-up costs for my garment line.
It's just been a slow start.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.930
If you could just give me more time.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.720
You want more time.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.000
Okay.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.090
I'm a fair-minded person.

15:37.220 --> 15:39.200
Company needs a chance to get started,

15:39.310 --> 15:41.430
get some advertising,word of mouth,build up a clientele.

15:41.530 --> 15:42.480
That's right.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.000
Okay, I understand.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.910
I'll give you until, 

15:46.020 --> 15:49.400
Tomorrow night --midnight.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.800
Or else.

15:59.150 --> 16:00.890
You want me to rough her up?

16:01.470 --> 16:02.650
No.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.640
No, we'll give her another day.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.350
Meanwhile, go get me that nosy cop.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.790
My calluses could use a workouT.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.960
So, you're from here,are you?

16:21.510 --> 16:23.550
Tree hill city,born and raised.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.110
What brought you here?

16:25.230 --> 16:28.100
Well, I know it sounds a bit corny, but, the rain.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.700
I-I know nobody likes the rain,

16:29.830 --> 16:32.940
but I was traveling from theater to theater, performing.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.490
And while the money was great,

16:34.640 --> 16:37.820
well, I really missed having a place I could call home,

16:38.170 --> 16:42.310
so I moved here and fell for the rhythm of the rain.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.540
Unfortunately, I also got stuck at dan's place for a while.

16:46.660 --> 16:50.710
But then lucas found me,brought me here,
and it was a perfect fit.

16:50.830 --> 16:54.270
Great club, rainy city.Home.

16:54.740 --> 16:57.210
I think I'll stay a while,if lucas will have me.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.530
Well, I know karen would approve.

16:59.940 --> 17:02.180
We all kind of miss her around here.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.250
After she lost keith, she left the club to lucas,and...

17:07.069 --> 17:09.210
...She would be proud to have a woman of your heart 

17:09.329 --> 17:12.260
and talent working here at the cafe?

17:13.450 --> 17:16.130
Well, I sure can class up a joint, now, can't I?

17:16.270 --> 17:18.390
Yes, you sure can.

17:22.579 --> 17:23.990
I was --

17:24.609 --> 17:28.400
I was wondering if maybe you might 
want to step out with me sometime.

17:29.990 --> 17:33.960
Well, why don't you stop wondering and ask me sometime?

17:36.150 --> 17:37.760
Nathan?

17:38.330 --> 17:39.650
Excuse mE.

17:45.050 --> 17:47.190
Before you get in too deep.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.750
Everything all right?

18:00.890 --> 18:03.940
How would you like to step out with me tonight?

18:04.320 --> 18:06.110
Sorry, but we're closed.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.410
I know.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.200
My car broke down.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.530
Right.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.100
So you can lure me outside,

18:12.200 --> 18:14.770
and dan and five of his goons will work me over?

18:15.350 --> 18:18.060
- No, thanks. 
- Dan's not with mE.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.120
I promise.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.370
Let me grab my coat.

18:35.090 --> 18:39.340
Well, I'll see what I can do.
I'm not really the mechanic type.

18:42.930 --> 18:45.080
The advancements on these things are amazing, aren't they?

18:45.180 --> 18:46.370
How much she set you back?

18:46.480 --> 18:48.280
Oh, hundreds.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.040
What do you drive?

18:50.290 --> 18:51.780
I don'T.

18:51.890 --> 18:54.400
I guess I'm not ready to give upon 
good, old-fashioned walking.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.210
You know, no one ever stands up to dan that way.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.030
That right?

19:00.810 --> 19:03.050
And to be perfectly honest,

19:03.160 --> 19:05.980
I think the confrontation made him respect you.

19:06.130 --> 19:08.270
That's how he judges people,you know?

19:08.420 --> 19:10.630
"Are they weak or are they strong?"

19:10.760 --> 19:12.400
It's just his way.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.520
It's not my way.

19:14.770 --> 19:17.830
I'm a kind man, unless you give me a reason to be otherwise.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.050
I'm sorry. I --

19:22.230 --> 19:24.600
my uncle keith was the mechanic in the familY.

19:24.710 --> 19:27.000
It's okay. Leave iT.

19:27.170 --> 19:31.290
You wouldn't mind a good, old-fashioned walk home,would you?

19:34.120 --> 19:36.220
Sure.I can do thaT.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.900
where do you live?

19:40.030 --> 19:41.610
That way.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.510
Let's go.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.260
I'm not sure how I feel about the war.

19:55.370 --> 19:58.650
I do mostly feel sorry for our boys having to leave home.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.530
I could fight, thougH.

20:01.580 --> 20:05.450
What?I could.Or be a nurse.

20:05.860 --> 20:07.870
What do you think? Would I be a good nurse?

20:08.010 --> 20:09.310
Yeah, I guess.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.460
Do you think I'm pretty?

20:14.250 --> 20:19.460
I don't think I know you well enough yet 
to say something like that.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.930
Well, you certainly don't talk very much, do you?

20:23.740 --> 20:26.670
Now, why would you want to walk me home if you didn't walk to talk?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.760
I'm not really the gabbing type.

20:29.330 --> 20:32.160
What does a girl have to do for some interesting conversation...

20:32.330 --> 20:34.940
short of throwing myself at you?

20:37.730 --> 20:40.460
Okay.I have a question for you.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.180
Why do you associate yourself with a guy like dan?

20:44.300 --> 20:45.790
He's scum.

20:45.930 --> 20:49.400
Everybody knows what types of things 
he's into over there at the comet club.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.820
People disappear around him.And yeT...

20:54.620 --> 20:56.400
you let him own you.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.490
Never mind.

20:58.610 --> 20:59.910
Oh, no, you said you wanted to talk.

21:00.020 --> 21:03.020
Now, here I am,walking you home, 
against his wishes,I'm sure.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.920
I'd just like to know.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.880
It's a long story.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.080
I've got time.

21:12.420 --> 21:16.080
My mother and dan were in love.

21:16.550 --> 21:20.360
And when she died,he vowed he would always look after me.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.910
I'm not his girl. I have my own placE.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.070
He just keeps me close to him and takes me out.

21:27.210 --> 21:28.820
You're a trinket.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.560
I'm cared for.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.400
Is that what you call it?

21:34.550 --> 21:36.200
I'm sorry.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.950
I'm not trying to be rude.I just --

21:39.700 --> 21:41.900
I don't like the guy is all.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.950
It's not that.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.020
I need to get ouT.

21:49.150 --> 21:51.550
I have been locked up my entire life,

21:51.650 --> 21:54.790
and I need to breathe.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.930
I need freedom.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.750
I-I need love.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.400
when you asked me to step out with you tonight,

22:14.910 --> 22:18.090
I didn't imagine it would be at karen's caf?

22:18.230 --> 22:19.710
Why not?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.510
We've got the best piano player in town.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.670
And the best drinks.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.720
And the best bartender.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.790
Haley, I have to tell you something.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.550
That letter that luke gave me earlier --

22:39.520 --> 22:42.480
my unit's been called up for active military duty,

22:42.740 --> 22:44.710
and I have to report tomorrow night...

22:44.860 --> 22:47.710
which means that this is my last night here,but...

22:48.770 --> 22:54.400
I want you to know that I wouldn't want
to spend it with anyone but you.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.370
Is that the truth? Because...

23:01.110 --> 23:03.580
Because I want to believe that it is.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.510
Yes.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.510
This is perfect to mE.

23:19.110 --> 23:20.870
I want to fall in love.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.200
My whole life has been planned and safe.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.290
Dan won't let me encourt me.

23:27.430 --> 23:30.180
But for once,I want to make my own choices,

23:30.290 --> 23:32.600
even if that means my heart shatters into a million pieces

23:32.700 --> 23:35.050
and I have to find the strength to put it back together.

23:35.230 --> 23:38.430
So, that's why I came back tonight --

23:38.560 --> 23:41.090
because I need something different, 

23:41.200 --> 23:43.960
and you are the first thing I've laid eyes on that iS.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.770
And I have said too much.I'm sorry.

23:48.070 --> 23:49.280
You are.

23:50.390 --> 23:52.040
What?

23:54.330 --> 23:57.430
Earlier, you asked me if you were pretty.

23:58.450 --> 23:59.770
You are.

24:03.530 --> 24:06.300
But it's your heart that makes you more than that.

24:07.790 --> 24:09.700
It makes you beautiful.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.860
Thank you.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.620
This is me.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.510
Luke, no one knows about dan loving my mother 

24:22.670 --> 24:24.720
--no one else in the world.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.620
Just me, him,and now you.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.800
I won't say a word.

24:32.030 --> 24:36.050
You know, there's a sign above the door in my bar.

24:36.180 --> 24:38.430
It reads,"people always leave..."

24:39.690 --> 24:43.540
but I say, 'stay a while,have a nightcap'."

24:44.770 --> 24:46.570
Now, uh...

24:47.340 --> 24:50.310
maybe you and i can do that sometime.

24:50.450 --> 24:54.010
Leave? Or have a nightcap?

24:54.180 --> 24:56.140
Whatever you'd like.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.400
Would it be all right if --

25:01.520 --> 25:03.330
just shut up and do it.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.750
Good night, peyton.

25:42.380 --> 25:46.690
Well, this must be the most romantic ever reserved for me...

25:46.820 --> 25:49.040
and the most interesting of entr*s.

25:51.540 --> 25:53.710
Penny for your thoughts.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.660
I love you.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.870
I always have -- ever since the first time I saw you.

26:01.950 --> 26:06.210
I know this might sound crazy,
but I just had to tell you,because...

26:07.330 --> 26:09.260
what?

26:10.580 --> 26:12.570
I'm not afraid of dying.

26:13.450 --> 26:16.870
But I am afraid of dying without you knowing 
how I feel about you.

26:16.970 --> 26:20.260
You're not going to die,nathan scott.
You're going to come homE...

26:20.870 --> 26:22.270
to me.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.650
I just think it's --

26:30.660 --> 26:33.840
why don't you let me do the thinking for the both of us?

26:35.570 --> 26:37.590
I've got a crazy idea.

26:37.990 --> 26:39.820
Do you trust me?

26:40.300 --> 26:42.030
Yes.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.310
You manage to find the money you owe me?

27:01.440 --> 27:06.100
No, but I have something much more valuable than moneY.

27:06.180 --> 27:09.510
Hey, boss, officer morello will be here soon for his...

27:10.640 --> 27:14.600
...Uh, appointment.Hey, sugar.

27:16.710 --> 27:19.650
What could you possibly have that I would want?

27:19.760 --> 27:23.200
InformatioN...about peyton.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.760
What kind of information?

27:27.190 --> 27:29.250
Forgive my debt,and I'll tell you.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.890
No, you tell me,and I'll consider it.

27:32.420 --> 27:36.300
Besides,you owe me money.
You really don't have a choice.

27:36.430 --> 27:41.270
What if I told you that your precious peyton 
was sweet on lucas scott

27:41.440 --> 27:44.440
and that I saw them together last night?

27:44.560 --> 27:46.110
I drove peyton home last night.

27:46.230 --> 27:48.030
Besides,we've discussed this.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.250
She knows better than to get involved with him.

27:50.340 --> 27:54.400
Well, I saw it with my own eyes late last night.

27:54.510 --> 27:58.290
And I don't think she heard you,
unless you told her it's okay to kiss him.

27:59.790 --> 28:01.520
You're lying.

28:01.970 --> 28:03.900
Get her out of here.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.960
Such a shame about peyton's mother...

28:14.520 --> 28:17.110
considering how you loved her.

28:17.510 --> 28:20.470
You consider my debt paid in full.

28:20.730 --> 28:23.550
Hell hath no fury.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.900
Pretty ruthless.

28:28.030 --> 28:30.270
There may be hope for you yet,brooke davis.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.340
Then we're square.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.420
Not yet.

28:37.030 --> 28:39.750
There's one more thing you're gonna do for me.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.900
You need a lift?

28:48.940 --> 28:50.400
No, thanks.

28:50.540 --> 28:53.900
You know, you could be making a lot more
 money at the comet club.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.030
I'm doing just fine at karen'S.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.610
Okay. All right.

29:01.750 --> 29:03.390
You're loyal.I get it.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.280
No hard feelings?

29:09.480 --> 29:13.650
Then again, I wouldn't call a piano player 
with a broken hand just fine.

29:16.930 --> 29:18.160
No!

29:22.460 --> 29:23.840
Hi.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.510
Didn't expect to see you here.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.600
I know.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.540
It might seem a little strange,

29:30.730 --> 29:33.590
but I would like for you to have this.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.460
When I was a little girl,

29:36.610 --> 29:39.480
my mother took me to a seaport.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.680
We met a sailor,and he took us out on the water.

29:43.030 --> 29:44.870
I felt free.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.450
And when he brought us back to the shore,I cried, 

29:47.580 --> 29:49.590
becauseI didn't want to go home.

29:50.430 --> 29:52.360
And he told me that one day,

29:52.470 --> 29:56.450
I would be free to see the world,to do as I pleased,

29:56.840 --> 30:01.070
but until that day,to keep the dove as a reminder of that dream.

30:01.240 --> 30:05.050
The dove has always stood for peace and love.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.440
But for me, that dove has always stood for freedom.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.380
I can't accept this.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.990
It comforts me, lucas. 

30:13.170 --> 30:15.030
And so do yoU.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.650
So I want you to have it.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.300
I should go.

30:24.230 --> 30:25.800
Stay a while.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.550
No.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.650
No, I think I'll hold out till that nightcap.

30:34.810 --> 30:37.230
Wouldn't want a girl to look too needy.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.310
You had to be stubborn, huh?

30:52.730 --> 30:56.880
You couldn't just look the other way and take my handouts.

31:01.330 --> 31:05.410
Look at you -- sitting there,all strong and proud,

31:05.580 --> 31:07.980
not even begging for your life.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.750
Wow, you really take the pleasure out of this.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.850
It kind of reminds me of keith scott.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.230
Oh, well.

31:24.190 --> 31:26.150
I'll get over it.

31:37.530 --> 31:38.870
Hi ya.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.250
You have another drink,**

31:48.120 --> 31:52.300
You should have stuck to gossip columns instead of 
snooping around wheryou don't belong.

31:53.990 --> 31:56.660
Gossip columns won't get you killed, kid.

31:56.810 --> 31:59.020
- Boss? 
- Stop it!

31:59.130 --> 32:01.530
What is this?!Get off me.

32:02.270 --> 32:03.540
What are you doing here?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.170
All this time...

32:05.310 --> 32:07.570
I didn't want to believe that you were evil,

32:07.730 --> 32:09.760
that you were a liar.

32:10.030 --> 32:12.240
But I think I knew all along,

32:12.380 --> 32:14.180
so I followed you.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.980
And what about you?

32:16.100 --> 32:18.220
How's lucas doing, whore?

32:19.040 --> 32:20.930
He killed lucas' uncle keith.

32:21.050 --> 32:23.640
I said I was on to something,and I was right.
He murdered him.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.840
Shut him up!

32:25.520 --> 32:26.930
Is that true?

32:27.050 --> 32:28.430
Go wait in the car.

32:28.550 --> 32:29.900
Is that true?!

32:30.010 --> 32:31.500
Go wait in the car!

32:35.030 --> 32:37.090
Go wait in the car.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.050
No.

32:57.110 --> 32:58.840
what are you thinking about?

32:59.330 --> 33:02.620
The house we're going to live in right here in tree hill city.

33:02.770 --> 33:04.430
Anything else?

33:04.980 --> 33:08.780
Well, since the houseis going to be so big,

33:08.890 --> 33:10.900
I suppose we'll need children.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.730
A little girl,just like you.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.310
a son.

33:18.450 --> 33:22.070
We could name him james,like haley james.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.730
- Jamie. 
- Yeah.

33:40.450 --> 33:44.990
well, well.The **ozy reporter finally cracks the case.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.690
Well donE.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.380
I'll tell you what...

33:50.250 --> 33:51.890
I'm a charitable guy.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.520
You beg for your life,

33:53.640 --> 33:55.660
and just maybeI'll set you free.

33:55.780 --> 33:59.770
No.I'm not crawling anymore --not even for you.

34:00.090 --> 34:02.520
And pretty soon,no one else will, either.

34:02.710 --> 34:05.930
They'll find out that you killed keith,just like I did.

34:06.130 --> 34:08.530
And then they'll bring you down.

34:09.969 --> 34:12.949
Oh, I'd say if anyone's going down, it's you.

34:22.389 --> 34:25.679
Hey, mouth, be a friend and get that for me, will you?

34:42.520 --> 34:44.440
That last drink's on me.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.639
Boss, peyton's gone.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.860
Hey, skills.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.739
Play something good for me?

34:57.980 --> 34:59.350
What happened to you?

34:59.460 --> 35:02.620
Julian, dan.

35:03.430 --> 35:05.740
They have mouth.They're gonna kill him.

35:05.860 --> 35:06.830
What?

35:06.940 --> 35:08.940
He found out that dan killed keith.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.560
Luke, I didn't know.I'm sorry.

35:12.460 --> 35:14.290
Luke, what are you doing?

35:15.630 --> 35:17.970
Luke, we can be free.We can leave tonight.

35:18.130 --> 35:20.890
Luke, listen to her. He knows she's here.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.630
You're gonna get hurt.

35:22.750 --> 35:26.550
He hurt me when he took keith away from me.
He's hurt everybody,including yoU.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.770
Somebody needs to stop him.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.070
LucaS.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.490
Were you serious when you told me 
you'd leave with me tonight?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.180
YeS.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.360
Skills, you've been a good man and a great friend,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.240
so I want you to have this place.It's yours.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.150
- I'm coming, too.
- No.

35:42.260 --> 35:43.940
You'd just hold me up anyway.

36:06.290 --> 36:09.360
Get over here, peyton.Peyton, now!

36:09.470 --> 36:11.290
She's with mE.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.040
Why does everything always have to be so messy?

36:32.230 --> 36:34.420
Okay, okay.

36:35.490 --> 36:38.280
Not even I'd shoot a man in the back, lucas.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.170
Actually, that's not true.I've shot several men in the back.

36:41.270 --> 36:44.640
Most of them deserved it,but I wouldn't recommend you do it,

36:45.260 --> 36:47.430
'cause I have a surprise for you.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.650
Ms. Davis?

37:03.250 --> 37:05.000

37:05.450 --> 37:07.270
That's a good boy.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.080

37:10.760 --> 37:13.480
Okay, ms. Davis, finish your job 

37:13.610 --> 37:15.660

37:16.350 --> 37:18.300

37:19.920 --> 37:22.970
Brooke, we've all had hard times.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.370
