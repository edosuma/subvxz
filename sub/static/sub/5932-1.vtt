WEBVTT

00:46.068 --> 00:48.400
I knew you'd come.

00:48.470 --> 00:50.768
I told you I would.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.838
I mean, I- I felt it.

00:54.910 --> 00:57.845
I felt it before you came.

00:59.081 --> 01:01.948
( man )
you're developing your powers, muriella.

01:02.017 --> 01:04.042
Our time together is paying off.

01:08.056 --> 01:10.718
( Wind Whistling )

01:29.244 --> 01:31.212
Stop.

01:33.215 --> 01:35.149
You have to leave.

01:35.217 --> 01:37.151
Is that your wish?

01:37.219 --> 01:40.052
Each time we meet like this, I feel-

01:42.691 --> 01:44.682
Weak. I feel drained.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.752
( Whispering )
Perhaps that is what love does to a woman.

01:50.032 --> 01:52.193
What do you know of love?

01:52.267 --> 01:55.236
I know that poets claim
they would die for it.

01:55.304 --> 01:58.330
- Would you die for it?
- Perhaps.

01:58.407 --> 02:00.432
- In a poem.
- ( Laughs )

02:00.509 --> 02:03.535
- ( Chuckles )
- What would my father say?

02:03.612 --> 02:07.946
There are many things in this world
your father doesn't know.

02:08.015 --> 02:11.110
Let this be one of them.

02:11.186 --> 02:15.782
Sacrilege. This is madness, Gallian.
you go too far.

02:20.095 --> 02:22.427
( People moaning, Screaming )

02:28.303 --> 02:30.931
( man )
may the gods save us.

02:31.006 --> 02:34.066
( Indistinct Voices )

02:37.980 --> 02:40.039
Keep pulling, Zeph.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.049
Use your legs.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.711
( Zeph )
It doesn't want to come out.

02:46.788 --> 02:51.122
- ( Grunts )
- It's those big ones that are always the toughest.

02:51.193 --> 02:53.457
- ( Grunts )
- ( Chuckles )

02:53.528 --> 02:56.827
See? Things worthwhile
don't come easy.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.435
( Cawing )

03:05.874 --> 03:08.900
( Squawking )

03:10.412 --> 03:12.403
You missed.

03:13.482 --> 03:15.450
I don't want to kill them-

03:15.517 --> 03:17.576
As long as they don't eat the crops.

03:29.498 --> 03:31.432
( Pig Squealing )

03:33.535 --> 03:36.834
Brought the hog.
Same deal as always?

03:36.905 --> 03:38.805
Winter's corn for the pig?

03:38.874 --> 03:41.308
Same deal. Deal never changes.

03:41.376 --> 03:44.140
It's been a tough
dry season, hasn't it?

03:44.212 --> 03:47.375
- I've seen rougher.
- King's recruiting.

03:47.449 --> 03:50.043
Soldiers get taken care of really well.

03:50.118 --> 03:53.713
I have this land.
Isn't that enough?

03:53.789 --> 03:57.247
you get older,you get tired
ofjust survivin

03:58.693 --> 04:01.457
Wouldn't you like
to test your courage?

04:01.530 --> 04:04.966
I mean, where's the courage
in just surviving?

04:05.033 --> 04:08.594
Damn it, Farmer, would it kill you
to just talk for a little while?

04:08.670 --> 04:12.538
I mean, we're not animals.
People actually do converse with one another.

04:12.607 --> 04:15.235
Norick, if I could talk these turnips
out of the ground, I would.

04:15.310 --> 04:19.178
When the rains come,
this ground turns to clay.

04:19.247 --> 04:22.341
Not even you could talk 'em
out of the ground then.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.750
That's what I love
about your old man, Zeph.

04:25.821 --> 04:27.721
He always knows how to set a mood.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.815
- Show Norick where we stack his corn.
- Okay.

04:30.892 --> 04:33.156
Here you go, Zeph. Have a pig.

04:33.228 --> 04:35.219
- ( Laughing )
- ( Squealing )

04:38.200 --> 04:41.966
( Farmer)
Guess you'll be staying for supper.

04:42.037 --> 04:44.267
Well, since you asked.

04:53.115 --> 04:56.448
Norick, it is so good to see you.
You should come by more often.

04:56.518 --> 04:59.544
Well, I figure Farmer saw enough of me
when he was growing up.

04:59.621 --> 05:03.751
Now that he's got a family ofhis own,
maybe he needs a little bit of a break.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.089
Norick thinks Father should quit farming
and join the king's army.

05:06.161 --> 05:09.927
- ( Gasps )
- Now hold on a second. I didn't say that exactly.

05:09.998 --> 05:12.626
He says the king's soldiers
make a lot of money.

05:12.701 --> 05:15.261
Farmer, you're not seriously
considering this, are you?

05:15.337 --> 05:18.204
You're my family.
I'm not going anywhere.

05:18.273 --> 05:21.470
- That answer your question, Norick?
- I was just talking.

05:21.543 --> 05:24.137
- Just talking.
- Well, everyone's got a talent.

05:24.212 --> 05:28.046
-Just talking seems to be yours.
- ( Zeph, Woman Laugh )

05:28.116 --> 05:31.313
Just ratting on his friends
seems to be yours.

05:31.386 --> 05:33.445
- Can I have some chicken, please?
- Don't give it to him.

05:33.522 --> 05:36.491
- Give me the chicken. Har, har, har.
- ( Zeph Laughs )

05:55.177 --> 05:57.111
Tell me something nice.

05:57.179 --> 05:59.113
Tell me how you love me.

05:59.181 --> 06:01.445
You know.

06:02.517 --> 06:04.781
( Laughs, Sighs )

06:04.853 --> 06:06.787
I only know what you tell me...

06:06.855 --> 06:08.914
and you tell me nothing.

06:08.990 --> 06:12.790
Look at these hands-
Broken to feed us.

06:14.196 --> 06:16.926
These hands speak louder than words.

06:16.998 --> 06:19.865
What is the cost of telling me?

06:21.303 --> 06:23.294
What more could you want?

06:24.839 --> 06:26.830
What every woman wants-

06:26.908 --> 06:28.842
A little passion.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.811
- A little passion?
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.782
Well, let me see what I can do.

06:39.454 --> 06:42.890
- ( Woman ) It's time to go.
- ( Zeph ) Why can't you come with us?

06:42.958 --> 06:45.449
( Farmer)
I have all those fields to clear.

06:45.527 --> 06:48.985
Remember-When men build lives
from honest toil-

06:49.064 --> 06:51.692
- Courage never fails.
- ( Laughs )

06:51.766 --> 06:53.791
That's right.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.941
I hate sleeping without you.

07:12.087 --> 07:14.317
Be safe.

07:15.390 --> 07:18.257
It's Stonebridge.
Of course we'll be safe.

07:29.337 --> 07:31.396
( Zeph )
Why do people call Father Farmer?

07:31.473 --> 07:33.600
Doesn't he have a name?

07:33.675 --> 07:36.007
Your father believes that people
become what they do.

07:36.077 --> 07:38.875
Norick brought him to Stonebridge
when he was just little.

07:38.947 --> 07:40.972
So Norick is his father?

07:41.049 --> 07:43.108
The whole town adopted him.

07:43.184 --> 07:45.846
Different families took him
at different times.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.354
But Norick- He always kept
a special eye out.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.516
I'm glad he has a family now.

07:50.592 --> 07:52.560
I'm glad it's us.

07:54.195 --> 07:56.288
Mmm!

07:56.364 --> 07:58.924
Mmm. So am I.

08:19.387 --> 08:21.582
General.

08:22.657 --> 08:25.922
Report to your king.

08:25.994 --> 08:27.985
Your Majesty, Krug-

08:28.063 --> 08:30.793
Savage army. The Krug-

08:30.865 --> 08:32.559
They-They fight with swords.

08:32.634 --> 08:37.003
This is ridiculous. It's as if
you were talking about armed dogs.

08:37.072 --> 08:41.475
They fight like men.
They killed off our entire scouting party.

08:41.543 --> 08:45.138
Had the general not ordered me to return
with word, I should be dead as well.

08:47.148 --> 08:50.345
This is some sort of sorcery.

09:07.869 --> 09:10.770
( Chattering )

09:30.792 --> 09:33.784
( No Audible Dialogue )

09:48.510 --> 09:50.637
( Low Rumble )

09:55.283 --> 09:57.251
( Rumbling Continues )

09:57.318 --> 10:00.344
( Rustling )

10:18.973 --> 10:21.441
( Rumbling )

10:44.732 --> 10:46.825
( Zeph )
Grandma.! Grandma.!

10:46.901 --> 10:49.096
( Woman )
Zeph, is that you?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.434
( Laughs )
I've got you.

10:51.506 --> 10:53.440
Finally! Into the oven with you.

10:53.508 --> 10:55.499
- ( Laughs )
- I hate the oven.

10:55.577 --> 10:58.444
It's dry, it's warm.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.743
You don't want us
to eat you raw, now, do you?

11:00.815 --> 11:02.749
Why do you have to eat me?

11:02.817 --> 11:04.785
Tonight, I promised your grandfather...

11:04.853 --> 11:07.253
we're going to eat a dish he really loves.

11:07.322 --> 11:10.086
( Rumbling Continues )

11:20.735 --> 11:23.135
( muttering )

11:24.706 --> 11:27.174
- So, how were sales at the market?
- It was good.

11:27.242 --> 11:30.837
Of course, the men tried to take
advantage of me because I'm a woman...

11:30.912 --> 11:34.780
so I make them pay more-
because I'm a woman.

11:34.849 --> 11:37.147
- ( Laughing )
- When we were kids you were always in charge.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.449
- Always the leader.
- No, I just knew what I wanted, that's all.

11:40.522 --> 11:42.319
Until she met your father.

11:42.390 --> 11:45.257
Your father does not take orders
very well from anybody.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.305
( Grunting )

12:09.083 --> 12:11.551
- Where's Grandfather?
- The bell tower.

12:11.619 --> 12:14.281
- Shall we go?
- We have to be careful.

12:14.355 --> 12:16.789
The bell tower was made
for times of war.

12:16.858 --> 12:19.224
you don't want to pull the wrong rope
and start a war, do you?

12:19.294 --> 12:22.161
( Grunting, Snarling )

12:28.469 --> 12:30.903
( Yells, Groans )

12:38.413 --> 12:41.314
( Norick )
Hah!

13:10.285 --> 13:12.913
What took you so long?

13:15.257 --> 13:17.225
( Grunting )

13:39.181 --> 13:42.344
Hah! They don't scare easy.

13:42.418 --> 13:44.352
( Grunting, Groaning )

13:44.420 --> 13:46.445
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

13:58.367 --> 14:00.301
( Norick )
This is crazy.

14:00.369 --> 14:02.530
Krug are beasts.
They don't have armor and weapons.

14:02.604 --> 14:04.538
I need to use your horse, Norick.

14:04.606 --> 14:07.040
- Where are you going?
- Stonebridge.

14:07.109 --> 14:09.134
- Solana and Zeph are there.
- I'm coming with you.

14:09.211 --> 14:11.236
Farmer didn't come?

14:11.313 --> 14:14.908
No. My husband likes to leave
the trade to me so that he can farm.

14:14.983 --> 14:16.917
You did well for a husband.

14:16.985 --> 14:18.919
He loves you very much.

14:18.987 --> 14:23.788
Yes. Yes. I believe he does.

14:23.859 --> 14:27.260
( man ) When the bride and groom kiss,
ring the bell five times...

14:27.329 --> 14:30.321
signaling their marriage
for the village to hear.

14:30.399 --> 14:32.924
( Grunting )

14:33.001 --> 14:36.960
Go. Go now. Take Zeph home now.

14:39.174 --> 14:42.109
Take him! You can protect him, Father.
Protect him.

14:44.346 --> 14:46.678
( Bell Clanging )

14:55.691 --> 14:57.784
( Laughs )

14:57.860 --> 14:59.794
- Are you ready, my lady?
- Always ready.

14:59.862 --> 15:02.524
( Grunting )

15:04.233 --> 15:06.633
Hold.

15:06.702 --> 15:08.636
Giving up so soon?

15:10.105 --> 15:12.733
Your progress is truly remarkable.

15:14.309 --> 15:17.278
If only Ehb had more soldiers
of your caliber.

15:17.346 --> 15:19.871
- Let mejoin your army and you shall.
- ( Grunts )

15:23.085 --> 15:25.383
( Both Laughing )

15:25.454 --> 15:29.083
I am not quite sure that the armies of Ehb
are ready for women warriors.

15:29.158 --> 15:32.958
Besides, what would your father say?

15:34.796 --> 15:36.730
( Grunts )

15:36.798 --> 15:39.426
My father never lets me do
anything I want.

15:39.501 --> 15:41.492
( man )
Tarish.!

15:41.570 --> 15:43.902
Prepare your troops to ride.

15:43.972 --> 15:47.305
Hordes of Krug are ransacking the land.

15:47.376 --> 15:49.970
Oh, the sun is blistering my skin.

15:50.045 --> 15:52.980
What is this nonsense you speak?

15:55.350 --> 15:57.375
Just do as you're commanded.

15:57.452 --> 15:59.682
I listen only to the king.

15:59.755 --> 16:01.882
It might behoove you...

16:01.957 --> 16:05.154
to learn a little respect.

16:07.462 --> 16:09.726
Respect is earned.

16:10.832 --> 16:13.995
You are mistaken.
Respect is my birthright!

16:16.972 --> 16:19.133
( Clamoring )

16:20.175 --> 16:23.008
( Shouting, Screaming )

16:28.850 --> 16:31.284
- ( Screams )
- ( Snarls )

17:19.635 --> 17:21.397

17:57.039 --> 17:59.803
( Man )
To the village, everyone!

18:01.276 --> 18:04.143
- Where's Solana?
- She's-She's sounding the bell.

18:07.749 --> 18:11.344
Don't worry, Zeph. I'll find her.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.479
- Father!
- Bastian!

18:13.555 --> 18:17.047
Take my sword.

18:17.125 --> 18:21.061
- ( Norick ) Get inside. And bolt the door.
- ( mother ) Come quickly.

18:21.129 --> 18:23.996
- ( Bastian ) Thank you, Father.
- Go.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.791
( Shouting, Screaming Continue )

18:48.090 --> 18:49.751
( Grunting, Snarling )

18:53.295 --> 18:55.229
( Norick )
We'll look for her in the village.

18:55.297 --> 18:57.026
( man )
Let's go, men.! Come on.

19:02.604 --> 19:04.572

19:31.299 --> 19:33.859
( Scream Echoing )

19:33.935 --> 19:36.233
( Laughing )
Well done.

19:36.304 --> 19:38.568
A man with spirit, huh?

19:46.014 --> 19:50.041
- ( Screams )
- ( Krugs Snarling )

19:52.988 --> 19:55.422
( Woman Screams )

20:16.678 --> 20:18.942
( Horse Snorting )

20:50.111 --> 20:53.137
- ( Snarling )
- Let 'em go.

20:53.215 --> 20:55.809
( Echoing Laughter)

20:55.884 --> 21:00.150
You already killed me once today,
and yet, here we are again.

21:17.138 --> 21:19.163
- Father!
- ( Groans )

21:22.277 --> 21:24.677

22:35.717 --> 22:38.777
Look! They're retreating.

22:40.455 --> 22:42.116
Zeph!

22:42.190 --> 22:45.956
- ( man ) They're going to higher ground.!
- Zeph!

22:51.900 --> 22:53.834
( man #2 )
Don't let 'em get away.!

24:06.141 --> 24:08.166
( Gulls Crying )

25:13.975 --> 25:16.239
I need a fourth marker for Solana.

25:18.413 --> 25:22.713
Nobody saw Solana.
Nobody knows.

25:22.784 --> 25:26.242
We didn't find her body.
She could have escaped.

25:26.321 --> 25:28.721
( Bastian )
He's right, Farmer.

25:54.660 --> 25:58.289
Gallian! Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

25:58.364 --> 26:00.298
I've been busy.

26:00.366 --> 26:02.766
( Door Closes )

26:02.835 --> 26:05.804
- Very busy.
- We had an agreement.

26:05.871 --> 26:09.432
I gave you access to my castle
so that we might work together.

26:09.508 --> 26:12.136
And I'm keeping my end.

26:12.211 --> 26:16.011
I'm sure recent events demonstrate
how very busy I've been.

26:16.082 --> 26:21.213
Yes, indeed. You have managed
to stir things up a bit.

26:21.287 --> 26:23.414
Stir things up?

26:26.258 --> 26:28.192
Tell me, Duke.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.854
What do you know of a man
they call Farmer?

26:38.871 --> 26:42.238
( Chattering )

26:42.308 --> 26:45.402
( King )
People of Stonebridge.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.845
The armies of Ehb
sympathize with you.

26:48.914 --> 26:51.883
This great tragedy will be avenged.

26:51.951 --> 26:54.283
Where were the king's army
when the Krug came killing?

26:54.353 --> 26:57.845
Peasant, do not forget
to whom you speak.

26:57.923 --> 27:00.517
In your world,
don't you bow before your king?

27:00.593 --> 27:03.926
In my world, the king's army's
expected to protect the kingdom.

27:05.965 --> 27:08.798
- Not just the castle.
- ( Woman Weeping )

27:08.868 --> 27:11.336
What of those taken by the Krug?

27:13.039 --> 27:16.497
- Krug taking prisoners?
- Silence!

27:16.575 --> 27:18.702
If these Krug have taken prisoners...

27:18.778 --> 27:22.714
it is not yet clear
what their purpose might be.

27:24.250 --> 27:28.084
( man ) The king's army will require
every man capable of combat.

27:28.154 --> 27:30.054
- ( Tarish ) Who is with us?
- ( Woman ) What will happen?

27:30.122 --> 27:33.888
The king has his armies and his walls.

27:33.959 --> 27:36.894
Those taken by the Krug only have us.

27:39.665 --> 27:43.863
- ( Tarish ) You dare defy your king's wishes?
- I'm with you, Farmer.

27:43.936 --> 27:47.099
- Guards!
- ( King ) Let them go.

27:47.173 --> 27:49.266
That is not the way of Ehb.

27:55.848 --> 27:59.443
- ( Farmer) You took a risk
turning your back on the king.
- No more risk than you.

27:59.518 --> 28:02.612
- I have no choice. She's my wife.
- She's my sister.

28:03.989 --> 28:06.514
All right, let's get to it.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.127
Stay here. Go with the armies to Ehb.

28:11.197 --> 28:13.222
You wanted the life
of a soldier, didn't you?

28:13.299 --> 28:16.632
Nah. I didn't like the uniforms.

28:18.104 --> 28:21.369
- Do you have a horse?
- A mare.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.568
She's old, but still strong.

28:24.643 --> 28:27.635
Old... but still strong.

28:36.622 --> 28:38.783
You're in my way.

28:38.858 --> 28:41.326
We have met before, have we not?

28:53.139 --> 28:55.232
( Solana's Voice )
Tell me something nice.

28:55.307 --> 28:57.571
Tell me how you love me.

28:57.643 --> 29:00.237
( Farmer's Voice )
you know.

29:11.490 --> 29:15.153
- I'm Merick, the king's magus.
- I've heard of you.

29:15.227 --> 29:17.661
Children's stories about magic.

29:20.599 --> 29:22.590
Your king needs you.

29:22.668 --> 29:25.660
Yeah, well, my son needed me.

29:25.738 --> 29:29.071
I failed him.
Now my wife needs me, if she lives.

29:30.442 --> 29:32.842
Does it occur to you, Farmer...

29:32.912 --> 29:36.313
that there may be events
of greater importance...

29:36.382 --> 29:40.512
than the loves and losses
of our particular lives?

29:41.587 --> 29:44.556
No. Doesn't occur to me.

29:45.624 --> 29:49.151
Try to stay alive, Farmer.

29:49.228 --> 29:51.458
Your king needs you.

29:52.932 --> 29:55.400
Far more than he understands.

29:55.467 --> 29:57.492
( Norick )
How did you know about this bridge?

29:57.570 --> 29:59.538
( Farmer)
As a child I roamed around these parts.

29:59.605 --> 30:01.539
It's how I spent my days.

30:09.481 --> 30:13.076
- If we wind through the gorge we'll lose a day.
- What are you thinking?

30:13.152 --> 30:15.916
We can cross it.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.081
Let's take the gear off the horses.

30:18.157 --> 30:20.182
What, do you mean
we're leaving 'em,just like that?

30:20.259 --> 30:24.059
Are you afraid we're gonna
hurt their feelings?

30:24.129 --> 30:25.926
- Go home! Hah!
- Hah!

30:25.998 --> 30:27.829
- Hah!
- Get out of here.

30:36.242 --> 30:38.233
Let's do it.

30:59.965 --> 31:02.058
( Grunts )

31:11.644 --> 31:15.080
- All right, I'll go.
- You're a brave old guy.

31:15.147 --> 31:18.776
I just don't want you weakening the rope
before I've had my turn.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.084
- Come on!
- All right, let's go. Come on.

31:24.156 --> 31:26.283
You were more concerned
about your horse.

31:26.358 --> 31:28.155
My horse I like.
It's you I'm not so sure about.

31:28.227 --> 31:31.594
Well, wait till you get to know me better.

31:31.664 --> 31:33.962
( Yells )

31:36.201 --> 31:38.965
( Both Yelling )

31:40.973 --> 31:43.737
( Stops Yelling )

31:49.381 --> 31:52.316
( Both Groaning, Yelling )

32:12.171 --> 32:15.265
That saved us a lot of time.

32:16.342 --> 32:18.537
Oh!

32:20.846 --> 32:24.213
-( man ) your majesty.
-( Tarish ) Get on your feet, soldier.

32:26.418 --> 32:28.386
( King )
How many men on guard here?

32:30.456 --> 32:33.289
I am on guard, my king.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.726
Hmm. You are on guard?

32:40.199 --> 32:43.896
- ( Duke ) Duke Fallow,you're very, very naughty.
- ( Giggling )

32:43.969 --> 32:46.665
You make my bosoms tickle.

32:47.940 --> 32:51.171
I'm gonna tell your mommy.

32:51.243 --> 32:53.973
Where are you going?

32:54.046 --> 32:57.038
( King )
my nephew amuses himself on the king's throne.

32:58.117 --> 33:00.415
Do you feel it suits you?

33:09.061 --> 33:12.326
you play while your king
and his legions...

33:12.398 --> 33:14.866
are off on a military campaign...

33:14.933 --> 33:18.425
and your only job...

33:18.504 --> 33:21.234
is the safety of this castle-

33:21.306 --> 33:25.470
which is guarded by... no one!

33:25.544 --> 33:28.172
Your Majesty...

33:28.247 --> 33:31.739
was off investigating
outlandish claims. Aah.!

33:34.853 --> 33:37.754
- Get him out of my sight.
- No!

33:38.991 --> 33:41.289
( Tarish )
Go on, before I make you.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.866
( Door Slams )

33:49.334 --> 33:52.929
Unhand me. You are not fit to kiss my gown.

33:53.005 --> 33:56.304
And you-You are not fit
to tarnish your uncle's crown.

33:58.177 --> 34:00.407
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

34:00.479 --> 34:03.277
Unless the king specifically orders it...

34:05.317 --> 34:08.616
you cannot touch me.

34:10.188 --> 34:12.123
Imperial law...

34:14.793 --> 34:17.023
is a toy...

34:17.096 --> 34:19.757
I shall never tire of.

34:25.036 --> 34:29.906
- Things are progressing according to plan.
- I cannot wait any longer!

34:29.975 --> 34:34.911
I cannot stand the suffering rule
of that senile goat.

34:39.818 --> 34:42.981
Make it happen.

34:46.324 --> 34:49.658
You wish to accelerate things? Fine!

34:49.728 --> 34:52.253
We shall accelerate.

34:56.902 --> 34:58.870
Good.

35:15.254 --> 35:17.017
Gallian.

35:17.089 --> 35:19.649
Must you always appear
suddenly from nowhere?

35:19.725 --> 35:21.659
I don't.

35:21.727 --> 35:24.355
I appear so suddenly from somewhere.

35:26.665 --> 35:29.361
You assume too much
entering my chambers unbidden.

35:29.434 --> 35:32.130
I'm not welcome to the hospitality
you've offered in the past?

35:32.204 --> 35:35.230
You're not welcome
to come and go as you please...

35:36.608 --> 35:38.542
and then vanish without a word.

35:42.481 --> 35:45.575
I'm not your harlot.

35:45.651 --> 35:47.642
How could you think such a thing?

35:47.719 --> 35:50.813
you know very well
why I must appear so quietly.

35:50.889 --> 35:53.255
I can't very well be pounding
on milady's door, now, can I?

35:55.627 --> 35:57.686
How do you come and go as you please...

35:57.763 --> 36:00.527
when you're considered by my father
to be an enemy of the king?

36:00.599 --> 36:04.091
I have friends. I wield influence.

36:04.169 --> 36:06.160
Why does my father despise you so?

36:06.238 --> 36:08.604
He's not known for his hasty opinions.

36:08.674 --> 36:12.269
Questions! I did not come here
to be interrogated.

36:12.344 --> 36:16.371
your father hates me
because I will not bow and scrape...

36:16.448 --> 36:18.712
before the almighty king and his magus.

36:18.784 --> 36:21.082
Because I will take from him what I please-

36:21.153 --> 36:23.246
Even his daughter's virtue.

36:27.459 --> 36:29.586
( Whispering )
Begone from my chambers.

36:30.662 --> 36:34.098
- Begone from my life.
- ( Chuckles )

36:34.166 --> 36:36.134
Are you banishing me as well?

36:36.201 --> 36:38.897
And after all the work we've done.

36:38.971 --> 36:42.065
Haven't I helped you
discover your power, your vision?

36:42.140 --> 36:44.802
- You've introduced me to
parlor tricks and nightmares.
- Be still.

36:49.047 --> 36:51.709
( muttering, Grunting )

37:06.331 --> 37:10.062
( Woman )
Help! Please. Please.

37:12.971 --> 37:14.905
My liege.

37:14.973 --> 37:17.100
Again allow me to offer
my deepest apologies...

37:17.175 --> 37:19.666
for mistaking your orders.

37:19.745 --> 37:21.736
A mistake?

37:21.813 --> 37:24.179
- Is that what it was?
- Yes.

37:24.249 --> 37:26.183
Hmm.

37:31.757 --> 37:33.748
May I sit, Your Majesty?

37:41.533 --> 37:43.865
Boy!

37:44.936 --> 37:47.632
I know- Go.

37:49.975 --> 37:53.138
I know I have failed your trust
on several occasions...

37:53.211 --> 37:56.840
and perhaps I may be
a disappointment to you...

37:56.915 --> 38:00.009
and the entire kingdom,
but I will change.

38:00.085 --> 38:03.179
I will shed this youthful folly
in this time of great battle...

38:03.255 --> 38:07.385
and I will prove myself a worthy heir.

38:13.365 --> 38:16.198
Eat.

38:19.771 --> 38:22.239
You show a knack, my nephew...

38:23.308 --> 38:25.640
for well-timed diplomacy.

38:27.412 --> 38:30.313
I guess that's something.

38:30.382 --> 38:32.850
May I offer a toast?

38:32.918 --> 38:35.386
Possibly.

38:35.454 --> 38:39.185
Drinking wine in the morning
is not a good way...

38:39.257 --> 38:42.249
to show... reform.

38:44.129 --> 38:46.154
Indeed.

38:47.232 --> 38:49.393
Yes, indeed.

38:55.207 --> 38:57.175
Long live the king.

38:58.243 --> 39:00.905
( Chuckles )
Yes.

39:00.979 --> 39:04.039
( man )
The Krug last attacked Stonebridge, in the south.

39:04.116 --> 39:06.107
( Tarish )
yes, and this harsh terrain...

39:06.184 --> 39:08.175
will drive them north,
around the marsh.

39:08.253 --> 39:11.120
Then we should attack.

39:11.189 --> 39:15.285
That is, if the Krug behave
the way they're supposed to behave.

39:25.604 --> 39:27.970
( Norick )
I don't like this, Farmer.

39:28.039 --> 39:30.030
Nobody goes into Sedgwick Forest.

39:30.108 --> 39:32.702
( Farmer)
The forest passes between the mountains.

39:32.778 --> 39:36.373
We'll come out at Slate Pass
as the Krugs arrive.

39:36.448 --> 39:38.439
There's more than brush
and trees in Sedgwick Forest.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.508
You don't just cut through it
when you please.

39:40.585 --> 39:42.815
you don't wanna
be stuck here at night.

39:42.888 --> 39:44.879
- We'll light torches.
- Torches attract eyes.

39:44.956 --> 39:46.389
- Let 'em look.
- Farmer!

39:48.727 --> 39:54.495
You know what people say.
There are... things in Sedgwick Forest.

39:54.566 --> 39:57.000
People say God watches over the innocent.

39:57.068 --> 40:01.129
People say a lot of things
that won't help us now, Norick.

40:01.206 --> 40:04.073
Come on. We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

40:17.161 --> 40:19.095
( Norick )
I don't see any path.

40:19.163 --> 40:22.599
- There is no path.
- So how do we know where we're going?

40:37.482 --> 40:39.416
( Whispering )
Wait.

41:00.571 --> 41:03.506
Whoa!

41:21.759 --> 41:23.989
Oh!

41:29.500 --> 41:32.128
( Bastian )
You were right, Norick.

41:39.477 --> 41:42.173
Is this part of the plan, Farmer?

41:45.449 --> 41:49.044
- Let us down.
- When I'm ready.

41:56.894 --> 42:00.227
Get out of our forest.
you have no business here.

42:00.298 --> 42:02.926
We hate your weapons
and your killing.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.525
- We're passing through, that's all.
- Then pass through...

42:05.603 --> 42:07.537
and never come back.

42:10.341 --> 42:13.401
( Both Yelling )

42:21.285 --> 42:24.880
We're, uh-We're lost.

42:24.956 --> 42:28.915
men- Not only useless,
but helpless as well.

42:30.828 --> 42:32.762
Your Majesty.

42:32.830 --> 42:34.764
I beg of you news of my father.

42:34.832 --> 42:38.529
- Your father has gone on an errand for his king.
- Please-

42:38.603 --> 42:41.936
What's happening?
I worry that he's in grave danger.

42:52.483 --> 42:55.281
The king's magus
has many responsibilities.

42:55.353 --> 42:57.981
What he does not need is a daughter...

42:58.055 --> 43:00.489
who's troubling herself
with the affairs of men.

43:00.558 --> 43:03.994
My father thinks that keeping me
locked in this castle will ease my mind.

43:04.061 --> 43:07.690
He's wrong. I know the mood of this court.
It's never been more troubled.

43:17.341 --> 43:20.071
Darkness threatens...

43:20.144 --> 43:23.045
our empire.

43:23.114 --> 43:26.106
Darkness that's spawned by magic.

43:26.183 --> 43:28.014
Come on! Hey.

43:29.654 --> 43:32.487
your father seeks reason...

43:32.556 --> 43:36.253
- and remedy.
- Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

43:36.327 --> 43:38.693
- Your father-
- Your Majesty!

43:38.763 --> 43:42.255
Gallian.! I feel like I'm dying.

43:43.567 --> 43:46.468
Did you dine well with the king?

43:50.908 --> 43:53.843
- What have you done?
- ( Chuckling )

43:53.911 --> 43:57.642
I thought you were in a hurry
to accelerate things.

43:57.715 --> 44:00.115
( Groans )

44:01.352 --> 44:03.786
I suppose I may have tampered
with the king's food.

44:03.854 --> 44:06.322
You've poisoned me.
You've killed me.

44:06.390 --> 44:09.484
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- ( Groans )

44:09.560 --> 44:12.654
It's nothing that can't be fixed.

44:18.436 --> 44:20.404
( Groaning )

44:24.442 --> 44:26.433
Please.

44:27.945 --> 44:30.209
Please!

44:30.281 --> 44:32.215
( Chuckles )

44:35.219 --> 44:38.382
Let us hope you remember
who has the real power here.

44:38.456 --> 44:40.151
Yes.

44:45.629 --> 44:47.620
( Panting )

44:54.572 --> 44:56.938
I'd say I've saved your life.

44:57.007 --> 44:59.441
Now what shall you do for me?

45:14.959 --> 45:16.927
The king has been poisoned.

45:18.129 --> 45:20.063
Can he be saved?

45:20.131 --> 45:23.567
Perhaps, if it's not too late.

45:37.448 --> 45:39.575
On my soul.

45:48.626 --> 45:50.924
A word in private.

46:00.471 --> 46:02.666
Fallow has fled the castle...

46:02.740 --> 46:04.731
and he's taken two full legions with him.

46:04.809 --> 46:08.506
( merick )
Well, that tells us who poisoned the king.

46:08.579 --> 46:11.480
Prepare to move to the north,
where we shall meet our new allies.

46:11.549 --> 46:13.642
The strength of our combined armies...

46:13.717 --> 46:17.312
shall allow for generations
of peace and tranquillity.

46:17.388 --> 46:19.515
I detect the hand
of Gallian in this.

46:19.590 --> 46:23.617
Why has Commander Tarish
not briefed us for this mission?

46:24.829 --> 46:27.195
( Groans )

46:30.267 --> 46:33.430
Anyone else care to commit treason?

46:33.504 --> 46:35.938
- How much of the army remains?
- A third.

46:36.006 --> 46:38.099
Hmm.

46:38.175 --> 46:40.973
Well, I have seen the Krug massing.

46:41.045 --> 46:43.275
Gallian is raising armies-

46:43.347 --> 46:46.009
- vast armies.
- How?

46:46.083 --> 46:50.213
How is that possible-That a single man
can cause so much devastation?

46:53.858 --> 46:57.521
My own daughter betraying me
to my sworn enemy.

46:57.595 --> 47:00.462
- Do you hate me that much?
- ( Moans )

47:02.833 --> 47:04.801
I thought that I loved him.

47:04.869 --> 47:09.397
He has tapped into our bloodline.

47:09.473 --> 47:12.806
You have tilted the balance
of magic in his favor.

47:12.877 --> 47:16.472
Thanks to you, the kingdom may be lost.

47:17.548 --> 47:20.915
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47:20.985 --> 47:25.354
( Weeping )
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

47:29.460 --> 47:31.451
( Norick )
Why do you hate outsiders?

47:31.529 --> 47:34.726
You hate each other.
Why shouldn't we hate you too?

47:34.798 --> 47:38.564
We stay in the forest to avoid
your wars and your contests...

47:38.636 --> 47:40.570
and your mindless enterprise.

47:40.638 --> 47:44.574
And yet, here you are,
shooting your arrows into our trees.

47:44.642 --> 47:47.202
Harm is but a way oflife
for your people.

47:47.278 --> 47:51.180
The fact that you don't realize
it is what makes you so dangerous.

48:00.558 --> 48:02.583
( Woman )
This is as far as I will take you.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.525
Good luck.

48:07.298 --> 48:09.232
( Muttering, Grunting )

48:09.300 --> 48:12.394
( Norick )
Do we have a plan?

48:12.469 --> 48:14.903
( Bastian Groans )

48:14.972 --> 48:16.906
( Grunting, Groaning )

48:41.198 --> 48:43.632
Are you awake?

48:43.701 --> 48:45.931
( King )
yes, I'm awake.

48:46.003 --> 48:49.063
You'll find it's not so easy to kill a king.

48:51.709 --> 48:53.677
We will attack.

48:54.745 --> 48:57.942
But, Your Majesty,
you have been poisoned.

48:58.015 --> 49:01.348
- Perhaps you haven't your bearings.
- I have my bearings, Commander.

49:01.418 --> 49:03.477
And I have my wits.

49:03.554 --> 49:06.921
The Krugs do not expect us to attack,
so that's exactly what we will do.

49:08.525 --> 49:10.584
Who poisoned me?

49:12.863 --> 49:15.696
I believe it was your nephew, Duke Fallow.

49:16.800 --> 49:18.825
Oh.

49:21.572 --> 49:23.506
- ( Sighs )
- And there's worse.

49:23.574 --> 49:25.701
He has abandoned the castle...

49:25.776 --> 49:28.438
taken the guard
and the 1 1 th and 1 2th legions.

49:28.512 --> 49:31.037
We will attack.

49:31.115 --> 49:34.312
First light. Summon your troops.

49:40.257 --> 49:42.452
How much time do I have?

49:47.097 --> 49:49.327
Your life is coming to a close...

49:50.401 --> 49:52.892
but there is time enough.

49:52.970 --> 49:54.904
( Thunder Rumbling )

49:54.972 --> 49:57.099
( Thunderclap )

50:00.611 --> 50:03.239
You sure about this, Norick?

50:03.313 --> 50:05.304
Not at all.

50:15.225 --> 50:17.659
- ( Woman, Indistinct )
- Shh!

50:21.732 --> 50:24.724
She's here, Norick.

50:24.802 --> 50:27.236
- I can feel it.
- I think you're right.

50:39.616 --> 50:42.210
( Grunting )

50:44.621 --> 50:47.556
Hey, hey! Easy.

50:52.262 --> 50:54.389
Solana?

50:56.333 --> 50:58.426
Solana!
( Grunts )

51:26.029 --> 51:28.657
Today...

51:28.732 --> 51:31.166
we ride for our king.

51:35.672 --> 51:39.073
And our king proudly fights...

51:41.478 --> 51:44.936
- in the name of Ehb!
- ( Cheering )

51:50.220 --> 51:52.188
Your Majesty.

51:56.026 --> 51:58.790
Ride!

51:58.862 --> 52:03.663
God blesses those
who die for honor and truth.!

52:03.734 --> 52:06.168
( Cheering )

52:15.913 --> 52:18.438
( Groans )

52:18.515 --> 52:20.676
I'm curious about you, Farmer.

52:22.452 --> 52:25.216
I sense danger in you.

52:25.289 --> 52:27.450
I can't read you.

52:27.524 --> 52:30.982
I can read most men,
like reading scrolls of flesh.

52:31.061 --> 52:34.462
But you- you, I can't see
past your scowl.

52:34.531 --> 52:36.658
Why is that?

52:53.526 --> 52:56.188
( Echoing )
Who are you?

52:56.262 --> 52:59.459
Some riddles aren't worth solving.

52:59.532 --> 53:02.000
( Grunts )

53:09.442 --> 53:12.240
( Panting )

53:19.786 --> 53:22.016
( Moans )

53:26.159 --> 53:28.889
You are here.

53:28.962 --> 53:31.226
I thought it a nightmare.

53:35.301 --> 53:37.235
Where is Farmer?

53:43.076 --> 53:45.442
Where is Zeph?

53:46.746 --> 53:49.715
Bastian, where is Zeph?
Is he with our parents?

53:51.951 --> 53:53.919
Yes.

53:53.987 --> 53:56.046
He's with them, but...

53:57.457 --> 53:59.391
he didn't make it.

53:59.459 --> 54:02.758
He... was killed with them
the day you were taken.

54:03.863 --> 54:05.797
I'm sorry.

54:06.866 --> 54:09.027
( Sobbing )
My baby.

54:14.974 --> 54:17.909
Did he die quickly?

54:18.945 --> 54:21.072
Tell me.

54:24.150 --> 54:26.345
Yes.

54:26.419 --> 54:28.444
He died quickly.

54:38.164 --> 54:40.291
Farmer will come.

54:42.602 --> 54:44.570
He'll find you.

54:44.637 --> 54:46.730
( Solana )
How do you know?

54:46.806 --> 54:48.740
( Norick )
Because he must.

54:49.809 --> 54:52.334
Because he needs you.

54:52.412 --> 54:56.075
At the end of the day,
you're all he really needs.

55:23.576 --> 55:26.602
( Groaning )

55:26.679 --> 55:28.840
( Hoofbeats )

55:33.119 --> 55:35.417
Don't die on me now, Farmer.

55:35.488 --> 55:37.456
Much for you to do.

55:37.524 --> 55:40.288
( Grunts )
Not looking too good, are you?

55:43.096 --> 55:45.064
( Grunts )
Ah. There.

55:45.131 --> 55:47.531
Try a bit of this.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.398
( Gagging )

55:50.470 --> 55:53.132
- What's it like?
- What is it?

55:53.206 --> 55:56.073
( Laughing )
That's medicine. Come on.

56:07.887 --> 56:09.912
( Woman moans )

56:23.903 --> 56:25.837
( man, Indistinct )

56:28.641 --> 56:31.235
- ( Woman ) No.!
- ( man Groans )

56:31.311 --> 56:33.245
( Gallian Chuckling )

56:33.313 --> 56:35.474
It's good to be home.

56:44.290 --> 56:46.520
( muriella's Voice )
I am not your harlot.

56:46.593 --> 56:48.527
( merick's Voice )
He has used you to destroy-

56:48.595 --> 56:50.563
( Gallian's Voice )
I know that poets claim-

56:50.630 --> 56:54.498
( merick ) He bends emotion for sport.
Have you learned nothing?

56:54.567 --> 56:58.628
( Gallian ) Haven't I helped you
discover your power,your vision?

57:10.683 --> 57:12.674
My lady?

57:14.721 --> 57:16.712
( Weeping )

57:17.890 --> 57:20.324
I am my father's undoing.

57:20.393 --> 57:22.884
I've jeopardized everything.

57:22.962 --> 57:25.624
But your father has
nothing but love for you.

57:27.567 --> 57:31.697
My girlish stupidity
has damaged him.

57:31.771 --> 57:34.968
Taking your life would damage him further.

57:39.712 --> 57:41.737
( Exhales )

57:44.250 --> 57:46.411
Perhaps you're right.

57:47.487 --> 57:50.149
I would like my father
to be proud of me.

57:50.223 --> 57:52.783
He already is.

57:52.859 --> 57:55.259
He's proud of an idea of me.

58:12.011 --> 58:14.377
( Fallow )
Prepare to meet your new allies.

58:14.447 --> 58:16.813
These are Krug.

58:16.883 --> 58:20.842
( Fallow )
Obedient, relentless and unquestioning.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.354
What you see before you
is a powerful army.

58:34.100 --> 58:36.068
( Horse Whinnies )

58:43.076 --> 58:45.044
( merick )
Take this man.

58:45.111 --> 58:47.671
Put him in the king's tent.

58:47.747 --> 58:50.215
See that my horse is well fed.

58:52.352 --> 58:54.320
Hold.

58:56.255 --> 58:58.519
So was this your urgent errand?

58:59.926 --> 59:03.157
This is the farmer...
from Stonebridge.

59:03.229 --> 59:07.165
- It is.
- ( Exhales )

59:07.233 --> 59:11.033
Now why does a disloyal dirt-lover
from Stonebridge...

59:11.104 --> 59:13.595
command such careful attention
from the king's magus?

59:13.673 --> 59:16.540
Because the king has
a special interest in this... dirt-lover.

59:16.609 --> 59:19.271
I know nothing of this interest.

59:19.345 --> 59:21.336
Neither does the king.

59:29.389 --> 59:33.553
I thought it was about time
that you two were properly introduced.

59:34.694 --> 59:36.628
We've met.

59:37.730 --> 59:40.392
But the last time,
he turned his back on me.

59:43.403 --> 59:45.701
Turned to what needed doing.

59:47.106 --> 59:49.370
I thought Your Majesty
would be interested in this farmer.

59:49.442 --> 59:52.343
He's been through a great deal
since we met him in Stonebridge.

59:52.412 --> 59:54.573
So has everyone else.

59:54.647 --> 59:57.548
What makes him so special?

59:57.617 --> 59:59.551
Because, Your Majesty...

59:59.619 --> 01:00:01.587
he is your son.

01:00:08.694 --> 01:00:11.663
( merick )
Farmer has a friend- Norick.

01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.995
Norick tended the queen's horses.

01:00:14.066 --> 01:00:16.967
I recognized him
when we were in Stonebridge.

01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:20.403
After the massacre
at Oxley Pass, this Norick...

01:00:20.473 --> 01:00:24.773
found a boy about three years of age
wandering in the battlefiield.

01:00:24.844 --> 01:00:27.278
There was only one boy at Oxley Pass.

01:00:27.346 --> 01:00:30.474
What do you think
of this tale, Farmer?

01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:41.055
One old man thinks he recognizes another
from 30 years ago.

01:00:41.127 --> 01:00:44.358
That's how you determine who's king?

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:48.366
You are the king's son,
and heir to the throne.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:53.234
I have no father-

01:00:53.306 --> 01:00:55.240
No parents.

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:58.377
I have no business here.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:11.686
Are you telling me that
that arrogant bastard is my son?

01:01:11.757 --> 01:01:14.351
He spent the last 30 years...

01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:18.363
living over a Stonebridge farm?

01:01:18.431 --> 01:01:20.558
It would appear so.

01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:24.364
It would appear so.
You told me he was dead.!

01:01:24.437 --> 01:01:27.235
You said they were all dead!

01:01:33.446 --> 01:01:36.040
What kind of joke...

01:01:36.115 --> 01:01:38.515
do the gods play on me?

01:01:39.919 --> 01:01:44.720
Sometimes the gods
know what is best for us.

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.725
What the hell does that mean?

01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:51.559
You remember the chaos
we were in? Hmm?

01:01:51.631 --> 01:01:54.657
War everywhere.
Surrounded by enemies.

01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:57.567
If that child had been
taken back to Castle Ehb...

01:01:57.637 --> 01:02:00.629
how long would he have survived?

01:02:00.706 --> 01:02:02.697
Growing up in Stonebridge...

01:02:02.775 --> 01:02:05.471
he grew up strong...

01:02:05.545 --> 01:02:07.604
and far away from the enemies...

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.671
who would have jumped
at any opportunity...

01:02:09.749 --> 01:02:12.013
to rid you of your son and heir.

01:02:16.422 --> 01:02:19.016
Dear friend...

01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:22.117
you better be right about him.

01:02:24.196 --> 01:02:26.926
You better be sure.

01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:30.366
( Chattering )

01:02:30.436 --> 01:02:34.805
The king needs every able man
he can get for this battle.

01:02:34.874 --> 01:02:39.607
- That's not my problem.
- His kingdom is threatened.
Your kingdom is threatened.

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:42.147
I don't know this king.

01:02:43.215 --> 01:02:45.877
Solana's my family.

01:02:45.952 --> 01:02:49.410
Norick and Bastian.
They are my family.

01:02:51.123 --> 01:02:54.217
And where will you live?

01:02:54.293 --> 01:02:56.227
Hmm?

01:02:57.663 --> 01:02:59.824
When the kingdom falls to Gallian...

01:02:59.899 --> 01:03:03.130
what future will you
be able to offer your wife?

01:03:04.837 --> 01:03:06.566
Think about it.

01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:28.327
Fallow, you have committed treason.

01:03:28.394 --> 01:03:31.852
We offer no quarter here.

01:03:31.931 --> 01:03:33.831
And anyone who follows
under your command...

01:03:33.899 --> 01:03:36.197
will likewise be
considered as a defector.

01:03:36.268 --> 01:03:38.930
We will spare no traitor.

01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:40.939
( Fallow )
Gentlemen...

01:03:41.007 --> 01:03:42.998
Commander Tarish
has poisoned the king...

01:03:43.075 --> 01:03:45.635
and accuses me of treason.

01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:48.009
Hah.!

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.173
Your ambition has no limits, Tarish.

01:03:50.249 --> 01:03:54.310
The Kingdom of Ehb
is now subject to my rule.

01:03:54.387 --> 01:03:58.448
We, as well, offer no quarters.

01:04:10.836 --> 01:04:12.827
You will never be king, my nephew...

01:04:12.905 --> 01:04:15.533
because you have no valor-

01:04:15.608 --> 01:04:18.805
Not now, not ever.

01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:28.346
The 1 1 th and 1 2th legions
are with you, Your Majesty.

01:04:30.923 --> 01:04:33.721
( Fallow )
You coward!

01:04:43.936 --> 01:04:48.339
( Tarish ) These Krug have no archers,
but they also have no fear.

01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:51.433
Now, they outnumber us,
but we are men...

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.843
- and we serve a noble kingdom.
- ( Troops Cheer )

01:04:54.914 --> 01:04:58.213
They are beasts, with bloodlust.
Nothing more.

01:04:58.284 --> 01:05:01.185
( Cheering )

01:05:03.522 --> 01:05:05.387
So, have you come to do your duty?

01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:08.359
I've decided to fight.

01:05:08.427 --> 01:05:12.523
I'll be proud to have you fight by my side
so that I might keep an eye on you.

01:05:12.598 --> 01:05:14.532
( Clicks Tongue )

01:05:38.777 --> 01:05:40.404
Mid guard.

01:05:44.716 --> 01:05:46.707
( Horse Whinnies )

01:06:03.034 --> 01:06:06.765
- (Jingles )
- Commander.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.829
Lead out.

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:17.281
( All Grunting )

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.324
( All Grunt )

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:34.995
Archers.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:38.794
Fire!

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.371
( All Groaning )

01:06:47.445 --> 01:06:49.436
( All Cheering )

01:06:55.453 --> 01:06:56.852
Fire!

01:07:20.378 --> 01:07:21.367
( Rumbling )

01:07:27.619 --> 01:07:30.247

01:07:31.856 --> 01:07:33.380
( Horse Whinnies )

01:07:48.707 --> 01:07:49.696
( Grunts )

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:18.966
- ( Horse Blusters )
- It's okay.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:25.698
( Horse Blusters )

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:29.537
( Hoofbeats Approaching )

01:08:31.282 --> 01:08:34.046
- Hyah.
- ( Whinnies )

01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:39.313
( Horse Whinnies )

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:54.729

01:08:56.474 --> 01:08:58.339
( Groans )

01:09:11.156 --> 01:09:12.953
( All Grunting )

01:09:13.992 --> 01:09:15.482
( Grunts )

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.687
General, take their flank.

01:09:17.761 --> 01:09:20.560
Men, move out.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:26.862
( Snarling )

01:09:26.938 --> 01:09:28.997
( Snarls )

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.617
( Grunting )

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.182
( Groans )

01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:55.465
( Groans )

01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:01.672
They fight like dogs.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.673
Yes, sire.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.868
( All Shouting )

01:10:08.546 --> 01:10:10.036
( Groans )

( All Shouting )

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.080

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:23.644
( Growls )

01:11:41.706 --> 01:11:42.764
Whoa!

01:11:43.875 --> 01:11:46.639
( Screaming )

01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:48.906
( Laughing )

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.959
( Screaming )

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:11.524
- ( Horse Whinnies )
- ( Screaming )

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:21.935
Let's go.

01:12:29.921 --> 01:12:32.014
Ready.

01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:34.117
Fire!

01:12:41.299 --> 01:12:43.130
Fire!

01:12:43.701 --> 01:12:45.328
( All Groaning )

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:53.873
These Krug fight mindlessly.

01:12:55.813 --> 01:12:57.747
Their minds belong to those.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.218
( Shouts )

01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:39.750
If you win the day,
it means nothing.

01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:41.382
We will win more than a day!

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:42.949
You have killed these.

01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:44.927
I will simply beckon more.

01:13:44.996 --> 01:13:46.395
( Grunts )

01:13:50.234 --> 01:13:54.830
Christwind. Is this where we pay for our sins?

01:13:54.906 --> 01:13:56.840
No, Norick.

01:13:56.908 --> 01:13:59.570
This is where we pay for our virtues.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.976
Sins are more than welcome here.

01:14:07.718 --> 01:14:10.084
( All Shouting )

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.122
Whoa.

01:14:15.026 --> 01:14:16.220
The king.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.634
Hold still, good uncle.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.164
( Grunts )

01:14:34.579 --> 01:14:36.069
( man )
Fire.!

01:14:38.249 --> 01:14:39.910
( All Shouting )

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.493
( Grunts )

01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:12.271
( Horse Whinnies )

01:15:33.471 --> 01:15:35.666

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:54.983
( Groans )

01:16:02.967 --> 01:16:04.958
( Groans )

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:10.100
- ( Grunts )
- Guards! Guards!

01:16:10.174 --> 01:16:11.539
Quickly.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:14.237
Get the king off the fiield.

01:16:14.312 --> 01:16:15.438
( man )
Come on.

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:22.719
Farewell, good uncle.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:25.415
- Ride.
- ( Grunts )

01:17:18.142 --> 01:17:21.634
( Chuckles )
You have won nothing but time.

01:17:21.712 --> 01:17:23.839
( All Grunting )

01:17:38.883 --> 01:17:41.317
( Grunting )

01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:43.683
I won't live like them.

01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:45.722
We're already like them. We're slaves.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:49.521
- I won't live like a slave.
- Norick, be still.

01:17:49.593 --> 01:17:51.584
( Grunts )

01:17:53.064 --> 01:17:54.156
( Groans )

01:18:15.786 --> 01:18:17.720
( Exhales Deeply )

01:18:21.225 --> 01:18:23.216
( Man )
Why are we entering Sedgwick Forest, sire?

01:18:23.294 --> 01:18:25.854
We shall cut though
the forest to Castle Ehb.

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:30.367
With no armies and no guard,
the castle is ours for the taking.

01:18:30.434 --> 01:18:31.560
Whoa.

01:18:35.439 --> 01:18:37.999
Let's get out of this place.

01:18:42.847 --> 01:18:46.305
Ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ho. Oh, ho, ho.

01:18:46.384 --> 01:18:49.581
Lookee here. A friend of the family.

01:18:49.653 --> 01:18:51.553
How delightful.

01:18:51.622 --> 01:18:55.080
Alone in the forest does not
make you feel vulnerable?

01:18:55.159 --> 01:18:58.856
- Keep your distance.
- You never did trust me, did you, Muriella?

01:18:58.929 --> 01:19:01.420
Your comportment
has never earned trust.

01:19:01.499 --> 01:19:04.400
Comportment? Decorum?

01:19:04.468 --> 01:19:06.595
Those are words for a castle.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:09.332
We-We are no longer in a castle.

01:19:09.407 --> 01:19:12.035
- There are no rules here.
- ( Horse Whinnies )

01:19:14.178 --> 01:19:16.078
( All Groaning )

01:19:18.582 --> 01:19:20.209
( Gasps )
No.

01:19:20.851 --> 01:19:22.580
( Grunting )

01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:24.086
( Grunting )

01:19:24.155 --> 01:19:26.180
( Both Grunting )

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:36.592
Hyah.
( Grunts ) Hyah. Hyah.

01:19:40.838 --> 01:19:42.362
( Grunting )

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.374
Whoa.

01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.576
Hyah. Hyah, hyah!

01:19:55.653 --> 01:19:57.621
( Grunting )

01:20:14.338 --> 01:20:16.932
- ( Horse Whinnies )
- ( Groans )

01:20:25.749 --> 01:20:27.740
( Groans )

01:20:31.689 --> 01:20:33.520
A special gift for you.

01:20:33.591 --> 01:20:35.081
- Thank you.
- ( Grunts )

01:20:35.159 --> 01:20:37.093
There are rules everywhere, my duke.

01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:39.686
Your talent for breaking them
has failed you at last.

01:20:39.763 --> 01:20:42.459
- I'm taking this one with me.
- ( Grunting )

01:20:44.835 --> 01:20:47.065
( Grunting )

01:20:56.747 --> 01:20:59.181
( All Grunting )

01:21:07.758 --> 01:21:09.316
( Grunts )

01:21:11.762 --> 01:21:14.060
( Bastian )
Run. Solana, go. Go.!

01:21:14.131 --> 01:21:16.065
I'll find you! Go!

01:21:18.202 --> 01:21:19.897
( Krugs Grunting )

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:21.961
( Gasps )

01:21:22.039 --> 01:21:23.802
( Grunts )

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.507
- Norick! Norick!
- ( Sword Clangs )

01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:35.575
What you always wanted-

01:21:35.653 --> 01:21:37.712
a courageous death.

01:21:37.788 --> 01:21:40.188
Ah,you were a brave old guy.

01:21:44.261 --> 01:21:46.752
( Bastian )
Solana.

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:49.993
( Solana )
Bastian?

01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:53.401
- ( Grunting )
- ( Clanging )

01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:54.528
( Grunts )

01:21:57.141 --> 01:21:58.608
- Oh!
- Come on!

01:21:59.677 --> 01:22:00.666
( Gasps )

01:22:00.744 --> 01:22:02.109
- ( Shouting )
- Stay back.

01:22:06.317 --> 01:22:08.376
- No. I'm good.
- ( Chattering )

01:22:36.313 --> 01:22:39.908
You fought well today.

01:22:39.984 --> 01:22:41.975
Slaying beasts...

01:22:42.052 --> 01:22:45.317
- can be a cruel courage.
- Yes.

01:22:45.389 --> 01:22:48.449
Whatever presents itself...

01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:50.891
-you'll do it.
- I'm used to hard work.

01:22:50.961 --> 01:22:52.952
( Chuckles )

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:55.191
Well, that'll come in handy...

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.134
when you're king.

01:23:04.675 --> 01:23:08.441
How do you suppose it is that you...

01:23:08.512 --> 01:23:11.208
fought so well today?

01:23:11.281 --> 01:23:14.580
I mean, was it...

01:23:14.652 --> 01:23:16.643
luck?

01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:20.486
you have qualities,you know.

01:23:20.557 --> 01:23:23.993
Leadership. And, of course...

01:23:24.061 --> 01:23:26.052
you speak your mind.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.595
This will serve you well.

01:23:36.373 --> 01:23:40.139
Wisdom is our hammer.

01:23:42.579 --> 01:23:45.742
Prudence will be our nail.

01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.712
When men build...

01:23:49.787 --> 01:23:53.188
lives... from honest toil-

01:23:53.257 --> 01:23:55.248
Courage never fails.

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.364
Where did you hear that?

01:24:03.801 --> 01:24:05.735
I told it to my son...

01:24:05.803 --> 01:24:07.998
every night...

01:24:08.072 --> 01:24:10.438
when he was a little boy.

01:24:12.576 --> 01:24:14.567
And no one else.

01:24:18.315 --> 01:24:22.376
Things are gonna be a lot harder
for you from now on.

01:24:25.089 --> 01:24:29.082
- I'm a simple farmer.
- yes,yes.

01:24:29.159 --> 01:24:32.686
- It's all I know.
- You know, there's that little village...

01:24:34.264 --> 01:24:36.858
not too far from here.

01:24:36.934 --> 01:24:39.994
They raise two crops a year.

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:42.903
- That would kill the soil.
- No.

01:24:42.973 --> 01:24:46.875
It does not kill the soil
because of the seaweed.

01:24:46.944 --> 01:24:50.141
You see, the seaweed
comes in from the ocean...

01:24:50.214 --> 01:24:52.205
and enriches the soil.

01:24:53.383 --> 01:24:55.510
You should try that.

01:24:59.056 --> 01:25:01.684
How do you know these things?

01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:04.125
Because I am king.

01:25:05.362 --> 01:25:09.731
Because I'm expected to know...

01:25:10.934 --> 01:25:13.402
about the land.

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:15.938
Just as you will be.

01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:19.875
As long as there are kings...

01:25:19.943 --> 01:25:23.174
as long as there is land...

01:25:24.782 --> 01:25:26.773
they will fight over it.

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:29.375
Battles fought for barren lands.

01:25:30.554 --> 01:25:33.148
What are these wars
if they never end?

01:25:35.926 --> 01:25:37.985
And they fought for peace.

01:25:40.597 --> 01:25:43.930
Peace- that's a dream.

01:25:47.971 --> 01:25:50.997
A dream that maybe you...

01:25:51.074 --> 01:25:53.065
as king...

01:25:54.678 --> 01:25:57.704
can bring peace forever.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.811
You don't understand.

01:26:06.223 --> 01:26:08.453
These battles have robbed me of my child.

01:26:08.525 --> 01:26:11.323
You forget they robbed me of mine.

01:26:21.939 --> 01:26:24.134
My son.

01:27:04.114 --> 01:27:06.275
- ( Chattering )
- ( Tarish ) General Hallette.

01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:09.615
Yes, sir.

01:27:09.686 --> 01:27:11.813
Take a scout to the north side of the woods.

01:27:11.889 --> 01:27:14.084
- We should know what's waiting for us.
- Aye, sir.

01:27:19.596 --> 01:27:20.722
- Commander.
- Aye?

01:27:20.797 --> 01:27:23.129
Look.

01:27:27.204 --> 01:27:30.105
( Tarish )
Well, now this...

01:27:30.173 --> 01:27:32.198
is a surprising delivery.

01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:50.359
Duke Fallow's here to meet justice.

01:27:52.529 --> 01:27:55.396
I assume the king lives.

01:27:57.167 --> 01:27:59.135
( Whimpers )

01:28:00.137 --> 01:28:02.071
General Backler...

01:28:02.139 --> 01:28:04.300
give this man your sword.

01:28:11.315 --> 01:28:13.306
No armor.

01:28:16.386 --> 01:28:18.377
A duel.

01:28:18.455 --> 01:28:20.446
How lovely.

01:28:26.763 --> 01:28:30.392
You remember what I did
to you as boys, don't you, Tarish?

01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:44.644
Can I at least have a lick of wine?

01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:56.750
Will no man help his king with his armor?

01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:02.924
Pigs.

01:29:05.002 --> 01:29:07.732
( Grunts )

01:29:08.806 --> 01:29:10.774
( Grunting )

01:29:27.124 --> 01:29:29.058
( Grunting )

01:29:38.535 --> 01:29:40.503
( Gasps, Growls )

01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:43.506
This duel- it will be your last, Fallow.

01:29:45.376 --> 01:29:47.367
( Grunts )

01:29:48.879 --> 01:29:51.473
( Grunting )

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.160
( Groans )

01:30:12.603 --> 01:30:14.366
( Tarish )
I should kill you.

01:30:20.177 --> 01:30:22.111
I should kill you.

01:30:22.179 --> 01:30:25.546
( man ) The king is dead.!
The king is dead.! King Konreid has died.!

01:30:25.616 --> 01:30:28.346
No. No, this cannot be.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.888
I am your king.

01:30:31.955 --> 01:30:35.118
- No, you are a curse to the throne!
- Commander Tarish...

01:30:35.192 --> 01:30:37.183
is bound by honor.

01:30:37.261 --> 01:30:39.559
He'll never kill the new king of Ehb.

01:30:41.432 --> 01:30:43.730
( Groans )

01:30:45.269 --> 01:30:47.464
( Laughing )

01:30:47.538 --> 01:30:49.802
( Sighs )

01:30:49.873 --> 01:30:52.569
Coward.

01:30:55.979 --> 01:30:58.209
My subjects of Ehb!

01:31:00.117 --> 01:31:04.349
Long live the king!

01:31:05.355 --> 01:31:07.346
Hip, hip, huzzah!

01:31:09.026 --> 01:31:11.290
Hip, hip, huzzah.

01:31:16.099 --> 01:31:18.431
Put it away.

01:31:18.502 --> 01:31:21.232
( merick )
Citizens of Ehb.

01:31:21.305 --> 01:31:23.239
Soldiers of Ehb.

01:31:24.741 --> 01:31:26.732
A few moments ago...

01:31:28.178 --> 01:31:31.113
our beloved King Konreid passed away.

01:31:31.181 --> 01:31:36.209
- ( man ) No.!
- Murdered by his nephew...

01:31:36.286 --> 01:31:39.585
who sought to take his place.

01:31:39.656 --> 01:31:42.420
By the laws of our land...

01:31:42.493 --> 01:31:46.429
the king's successor
must be related to him by blood.

01:31:46.497 --> 01:31:49.193
I give you your new king...

01:31:49.266 --> 01:31:52.258
the lost son of Konreid...

01:31:52.336 --> 01:31:55.305
Camden Konreid...

01:31:55.372 --> 01:31:58.205
known to some of you as Farmer.

01:32:28.539 --> 01:32:30.530
Stand.

01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:34.340
On your feet, please. Stand up.

01:32:40.017 --> 01:32:43.475
The king called upon you to face death.

01:32:43.554 --> 01:32:47.354
Those still standing have
cheated death of its prize.

01:32:47.424 --> 01:32:49.289
But our enemy still lives.

01:32:49.359 --> 01:32:53.921
He'll rebuild his forces
and launch a renewed assault.

01:32:55.032 --> 01:32:58.058
Tonight we dress our wounds...

01:32:58.135 --> 01:33:00.126
bury our dead.

01:33:01.338 --> 01:33:04.535
Tomorrow we march
on Christwind hold.

01:33:04.608 --> 01:33:08.874
- Gouge evil from its shell.
- ( man ) Gouge evil from its shell.!

01:33:08.946 --> 01:33:11.642
God save the king!

01:33:11.715 --> 01:33:13.876
( All Cheering )

01:33:28.065 --> 01:33:30.499
( Grunts )

01:33:30.567 --> 01:33:32.228
( Grunting )

01:33:32.302 --> 01:33:34.361
What? What do you want?
Take them away!

01:33:34.438 --> 01:33:37.066
Take them with the others.!

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.131
Wait.

01:33:39.209 --> 01:33:41.905
Bring her over here.

01:33:41.979 --> 01:33:43.970
Begone.

01:33:52.222 --> 01:33:54.213
I sense him...

01:33:55.926 --> 01:33:58.656
in you.

01:33:58.729 --> 01:34:00.720
The farmer.

01:34:02.766 --> 01:34:04.757
( Laughs )

01:34:05.902 --> 01:34:08.393
He'll come for you.
This is perfect.

01:34:08.472 --> 01:34:11.532
- And I will be expecting him.
- I'm nothing to you.

01:34:11.608 --> 01:34:13.576
Yes, but he is something to me.

01:34:15.145 --> 01:34:17.409
More than a farmer.

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:22.180
Much more dangerous to me than a farmer.

01:34:22.252 --> 01:34:24.447
Now he'll come to me.

01:34:28.659 --> 01:34:30.024
How do you know me?

01:34:30.093 --> 01:34:32.084
How?

01:34:34.331 --> 01:34:36.356
( Whispers )
Don't move.

01:34:36.433 --> 01:34:38.367
Don't move.

01:34:38.435 --> 01:34:40.062
I feel him...

01:34:40.137 --> 01:34:42.765
in you.

01:34:42.839 --> 01:34:45.364
Because you're carrying...

01:34:45.442 --> 01:34:47.433
his son.

01:34:50.414 --> 01:34:53.349
You're carrying his son.

01:34:55.218 --> 01:34:58.153
- ( Gasps )
- ( Chuckles )

01:34:58.955 --> 01:35:01.389
( Grunts )

01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:04.791
( Grunting )

01:35:07.964 --> 01:35:09.397
Where you from?

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.731
Gloucern. They took me from my home.

01:35:13.804 --> 01:35:16.102
We'll get you back home.

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.331
We'll die here.

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:54.066
Good-bye, old friend.

01:36:32.682 --> 01:36:34.707
( Farmer )
How do you fight an army that large?

01:36:34.785 --> 01:36:37.515
Where the broadsword fails,
the dagger may succeed.

01:36:37.587 --> 01:36:39.919
No time for riddles, magus.

01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:43.016
A small force might
slip through the Krug lines...

01:36:43.093 --> 01:36:45.323
and solve the problem at its source.

01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:49.264
Get me to this Gallian...

01:36:49.332 --> 01:36:51.323
and I'll kill him.

01:36:51.401 --> 01:36:54.529
Sir, with respect...

01:36:54.604 --> 01:36:58.096
are we making plans to save one woman
when there is an entire kingdom at risk?

01:36:58.175 --> 01:37:02.942
If the king is to save his wife,
he must kill Gallian.

01:37:03.013 --> 01:37:06.176
If he kills Gallian,
the kingdom is saved.

01:37:10.287 --> 01:37:12.653
( Chattering )

01:37:12.722 --> 01:37:14.986
Muriella.

01:37:15.058 --> 01:37:17.049
Now is the time.

01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:21.187
Your Majesty.

01:37:22.499 --> 01:37:25.696
I wish to join your mission.
I wish to be of service.

01:37:25.769 --> 01:37:28.203
Yes. Well, you've made your point.
Now go back to the castle.

01:37:28.271 --> 01:37:30.262
I am my father's daughter...

01:37:31.741 --> 01:37:33.800
and I will serve the king
just as he does.

01:37:37.547 --> 01:37:40.448
You brought the king's murderer.

01:37:40.517 --> 01:37:42.951
He fell into my hands.

01:37:43.019 --> 01:37:46.284
A man needs all the help
he can get, magus.

01:37:46.356 --> 01:37:48.881
I accept your offer.

01:37:51.795 --> 01:37:54.195
- There are others who wish to help.
- Which others?

01:37:54.264 --> 01:37:56.255
( muriella )
Let me show you.

01:38:01.571 --> 01:38:05.337
- You've managed to stay alive.
- I've stayed away.

01:38:06.877 --> 01:38:10.836
Those who you fight,
those who control the Krug-

01:38:13.216 --> 01:38:14.774
we will help you fight them.

01:38:14.851 --> 01:38:17.081
Thought you didn't involve yourself
in the conflicts of men.

01:38:17.153 --> 01:38:19.178
This war isn't going away.
We can see that.

01:38:19.256 --> 01:38:21.622
And when our forest
is burned and invaded...

01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:23.921
we have no other choice.

01:38:23.994 --> 01:38:27.191
We will fight with you,
and then we wish to be left alone.

01:38:55.825 --> 01:38:58.555
Christwind.

01:38:58.628 --> 01:39:02.792
- Built as a secure haven for magi.
- How secure?

01:39:02.866 --> 01:39:05.699
Hmm. Well, the doors
open from within.

01:39:05.769 --> 01:39:07.760
You can get in?

01:39:07.837 --> 01:39:12.001
- A magus does not need
doorways to enter Christwind.
- I'll find a way.

01:39:12.075 --> 01:39:15.704
Do you consider yourself
lucky to be alive?

01:39:17.047 --> 01:39:18.981
I do.

01:39:19.049 --> 01:39:21.540
Life...

01:39:21.618 --> 01:39:24.246
has never been so exciting.

01:39:29.292 --> 01:39:31.760
Those people who came with me-

01:39:31.828 --> 01:39:33.762
Why not free them?

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:38.665
You do not want the world to know
that you have ultimate power and mercy?

01:39:38.735 --> 01:39:40.726
Do you understand nothing?

01:39:41.972 --> 01:39:43.963
I'm beyond mercy.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.008
I'm beyond good and bad.

01:39:46.076 --> 01:39:47.771
These are childish ideas.

01:39:47.844 --> 01:39:51.678
I'm changing the structures of the world.

01:39:51.748 --> 01:39:54.182
Where would I stop if
I showed your friends mercy?

01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:57.117
- It could-
- No exemptions!

01:39:57.187 --> 01:40:00.247
No one. Not you.
Not the farmer.

01:40:00.323 --> 01:40:04.225
Not your poor screaming boy
whose insides I tore out.

01:40:05.195 --> 01:40:06.890
Kill me!

01:40:06.963 --> 01:40:08.954
Kill me!

01:40:15.639 --> 01:40:17.869
I won't kill you.

01:40:17.942 --> 01:40:19.933
I enjoy you.

01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:22.444
If you can bleed, you can die.

01:40:22.513 --> 01:40:26.279
Perhaps I can.
( Whispers ) But I won't.

01:40:28.018 --> 01:40:30.919
I have too much work to do.

01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:48.336
( Thunderclaps )

01:40:51.041 --> 01:40:53.032
( men murmuring )

01:41:15.966 --> 01:41:19.732
- Tarish.
- ( man Speaks, Indistinct )

01:41:30.848 --> 01:41:32.839
( Thunder Rumbles )

01:41:43.828 --> 01:41:46.490
( All Grunting )

01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:50.223
( All Grunting )

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.775
( All Shouting )

01:42:05.716 --> 01:42:07.013
Archers ready.

01:42:17.695 --> 01:42:19.663
Fire!

01:42:36.814 --> 01:42:39.214
Now!

01:43:10.281 --> 01:43:13.182
There is a cave up there.

01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:15.377
It allows the air to enter.

01:43:15.452 --> 01:43:18.819
And now I must leave you.

01:43:18.889 --> 01:43:20.914
I don't want you to go alone.

01:43:20.991 --> 01:43:25.360
If there is any sanity left in that madman,
then I must try to reach it.

01:43:25.429 --> 01:43:27.897
You can't reason with evil, Merick.

01:43:27.965 --> 01:43:31.128
But I should at least
be able to distract him.

01:44:03.534 --> 01:44:04.660
I knew you'd come.

01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:08.861
Old friend.

01:44:20.684 --> 01:44:22.675
We were friends once.

01:44:23.721 --> 01:44:25.916
But you have greatly changed.

01:44:27.858 --> 01:44:29.826
Oh?

01:45:11.235 --> 01:45:14.568
A magus's power is contingent...

01:45:14.638 --> 01:45:16.071
on his service to a king.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:19.576
How is it that you thrive
as the king's adversary?

01:45:19.643 --> 01:45:21.338
How do you like my Krug?

01:45:21.412 --> 01:45:24.506
- They are a cruel abomination.
- ( Laughs )

01:45:24.581 --> 01:45:27.072
Funny thing about Krug.

01:45:27.151 --> 01:45:29.085
They have no king.

01:45:29.153 --> 01:45:31.087
So guess what I've done, old friend.

01:45:31.155 --> 01:45:34.750
- I dare not guess.
- I've made myselfking.

01:45:34.825 --> 01:45:36.816
King of the Krug.

01:45:36.894 --> 01:45:41.092
Now I serve a king
who deserves my utmost devotion.

01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:42.860
- Me.
- Enough!

01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:51.369
Gallian,you and I
are the last of the magi.

01:45:51.442 --> 01:45:55.003
I beg you, recognize
that you have fallen into madness.

01:45:58.015 --> 01:46:00.415
You have no idea...

01:46:00.484 --> 01:46:02.509
how powerful...

01:46:02.586 --> 01:46:04.520
madness can be.

01:46:20.971 --> 01:46:22.131
( Groans Softly )

01:46:26.610 --> 01:46:28.407
( Chuckles )

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:33.876
In my kingdom, there will be
no word for madness.

01:46:33.951 --> 01:46:36.181
We shall simply call it...

01:46:36.253 --> 01:46:38.380
- power.
- ( Groaning )

01:46:51.201 --> 01:46:53.294
( men Shouting )

01:46:57.841 --> 01:46:59.900
Charge!

01:46:59.977 --> 01:47:02.070
( All Shouting )

01:47:28.172 --> 01:47:30.106
Hmm. He's here.

01:47:30.174 --> 01:47:31.607
He's arrived.

01:47:32.843 --> 01:47:34.902
I see no reason to prolong this battle.

01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:39.981
( Groaning Softly )
Muriella.

01:47:41.718 --> 01:47:43.709
Muriella.

01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:01.833
You're here.

01:48:01.905 --> 01:48:04.465
I don't know how it happened.

01:48:04.541 --> 01:48:08.375
How could I have been so stupid?

01:48:09.713 --> 01:48:11.977
Forgive me...

01:48:12.049 --> 01:48:14.040
magus.

01:48:15.752 --> 01:48:17.310
Take the last of my power.

01:48:54.458 --> 01:48:56.449
( Grunts )

01:48:56.526 --> 01:48:59.552
( Krug Grunting )

01:48:59.630 --> 01:49:01.621
( Grunts )

01:49:01.698 --> 01:49:04.360
( Man Whimpers )

01:49:11.642 --> 01:49:13.974
- ( man ) Kill them.!
- ( man #2 ) Somebody help us.

01:49:17.347 --> 01:49:19.076
- ( Shouting )
- ( Grunts )

01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:20.874
( Grunts )

01:49:20.951 --> 01:49:23.044
( man )
Look out behind you.!

01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:27.253
Run! Go!

01:49:27.324 --> 01:49:29.451
Move it. Let's go. Go!

01:49:29.526 --> 01:49:31.517
( Groaning )

01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:36.231
( Gallian )
This way, Farmer.

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:38.291
This way.

01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:42.629
( Chattering )

01:49:59.823 --> 01:50:01.814
( Thunderclap )

01:50:01.892 --> 01:50:04.190
( men Shouting )

01:51:00.388 --> 01:51:04.154
( Solana )
Farmer. Oh.!

01:51:06.594 --> 01:51:09.859
- ( Gasps )
- you've caused me a lot of worry, Farmer.

01:51:15.303 --> 01:51:17.794
I understand you've become king.

01:51:17.872 --> 01:51:21.364
We can't have two kings bickering
over a single kingdom, now, can we?

01:51:21.442 --> 01:51:24.377
How often do two kings
get to do battle one-on-one...

01:51:24.445 --> 01:51:27.175
getting to taste the blood
of one's true enemy?

01:51:27.248 --> 01:51:30.513
Are you gonna fight...
or talk me to death?

01:51:30.985 --> 01:51:32.748
( Groans )

01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:39.256
- ( Chuckles )
- ( Grunts )

01:52:11.525 --> 01:52:13.550
You wanna fight me with magic?

01:52:13.628 --> 01:52:16.222
- Where's your honor?
- ( Laughs )

01:52:22.136 --> 01:52:23.364
( Shouts )

01:52:37.985 --> 01:52:40.886
( All Shouting )

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.411
( Grunts )

01:53:32.006 --> 01:53:33.337
I will have my vengeance.

01:53:53.227 --> 01:53:55.024
( All Grunting, Shouting )

01:53:57.465 --> 01:53:59.865
( All Shouting )

01:54:11.712 --> 01:54:12.736
( Groans )

01:54:12.813 --> 01:54:13.802
No!

01:54:47.348 --> 01:54:51.341
What manner of vengeance
are you enjoying, Farmer?

01:54:51.419 --> 01:54:54.217
The vengeance of a father,
the vengeance of a husband...

01:54:54.288 --> 01:54:56.882
or the vengeance of a king?

01:55:01.262 --> 01:55:03.230
- You forget the vengeance of a mother.
- ( Groans )

01:55:08.269 --> 01:55:10.237
( Groans )

01:55:16.877 --> 01:55:17.969
( Shouts )

01:55:21.215 --> 01:55:23.206
( Blood Trickles )

01:55:24.452 --> 01:55:26.477
( Groans )

01:55:28.556 --> 01:55:29.750
( Sighs )

01:55:39.066 --> 01:55:41.057
( Coughing )

01:55:42.670 --> 01:55:46.265
( Coughing, Grunting )

01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.638
( All Snorting )

01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:50.677
What's happening?

01:56:21.775 --> 01:56:24.642
There's something
I've always wanted to tell you.

01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:27.670
I love you.

01:57:14.261 --> 01:57:16.752
( Folk Rock )

01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:33.977
Would you believe
in a night like this

01:57:34.048 --> 01:57:35.982
A night like this

01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:38.484
When visions come true

01:57:38.552 --> 01:57:42.044
Would you believe
in a tale like this

01:57:42.122 --> 01:57:44.420
A lay ofbliss

01:57:44.491 --> 01:57:47.426
Praising the old lore

01:57:47.494 --> 01:57:53.399
Come to the blazing fire
and see me in the shadows

01:57:53.467 --> 01:57:57.460
See me in the shadows

01:57:57.538 --> 01:58:01.030
Songs I will sing
of runes and rings

01:58:01.108 --> 01:58:05.340
Just hand me my harp
this night turns into myth

01:58:05.412 --> 01:58:09.143
Nothing seems real
you soon will feel

01:58:09.216 --> 01:58:12.549
The world we live in
is another skald's

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:16.579
Dream in the shadows

01:58:16.657 --> 01:58:20.753
Dream in the shadows

01:58:27.801 --> 01:58:31.396
Do you believe
there is sense in it

01:58:31.472 --> 01:58:33.497
Is it truth or myth

01:58:33.574 --> 01:58:35.735
They're one in my rhymes

01:58:35.809 --> 01:58:39.472
Nobody knows the meaning behind

01:58:39.546 --> 01:58:41.605
The weaver's line

01:58:41.682 --> 01:58:46.745
Well, nobody else
but the Norns can

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:50.586
See through the blazing
fires of time and

01:58:50.658 --> 01:58:56.597
All things will proceed
as the child of the hallowed

01:58:56.664 --> 01:59:00.930
Will speak to you now

01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:04.835
See me in the shadows

01:59:04.905 --> 01:59:08.773
See me in the shadows

01:59:08.842 --> 01:59:12.778
Songs I will sing
of tribes and kings

01:59:12.846 --> 01:59:16.873
The carrion bird
and the hall of the slain

01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:20.909
Nothing seems real
you soon will feel

01:59:20.988 --> 01:59:24.014
The world we live in
is another skald's

01:59:24.091 --> 01:59:27.891
Dream in the shadows

01:59:27.961 --> 01:59:32.364
Dream in the shadows

01:59:38.539 --> 01:59:40.700
Do not fear for my reason

01:59:40.774 --> 01:59:42.935
There's nothing to hide

01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:46.912
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie

01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:51.280
Remember the runes
and remember the light

01:59:51.352 --> 01:59:54.947
All I ever want
is to be at your side

01:59:55.022 --> 01:59:56.956
We'll gladden the raven

01:59:57.024 --> 02:00:00.824
Now I will run through
the blazing fires

02:00:00.894 --> 02:00:03.192
That's my choice

02:00:03.263 --> 02:00:06.494
'Cause things shall proceed as foreseen

02:00:06.567 --> 02:00:10.435
( Vocalizing )

02:00:23.150 --> 02:00:25.141
( Ends )

02:00:25.219 --> 02:00:27.210
( Pop Ballad )

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.563
Pale-face the innocent

02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:41.260
Will drown in blood

02:00:41.335 --> 02:00:43.269
Hurt and withdrawn

02:00:43.337 --> 02:00:47.296
Don't ever steal my grief

02:00:47.374 --> 02:00:50.901
In this haze of green and gold

02:00:50.978 --> 02:00:52.946
He's gone

02:00:53.013 --> 02:00:56.661
Blind my eyes and I still can see

02:00:56.795 --> 02:00:59.355
Through the mist to the very end

02:00:59.431 --> 02:01:02.594
There I'll face what I fear the most

02:01:02.667 --> 02:01:08.469
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter right now

02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.031
I will bury my dead

02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:15.102
And keep on till the end

02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.614
I won't give up

02:01:17.682 --> 02:01:20.674
I won't give up

02:01:20.752 --> 02:01:25.212
I'll turn to the red fiields of none

02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:27.224
There's a grave

02:01:27.292 --> 02:01:29.954
There's a rose

02:01:30.028 --> 02:01:33.486
- Drift away
- I can hear me say

02:01:33.565 --> 02:01:38.059
Soon you all shall be free

02:01:38.136 --> 02:01:40.969
Carry the blessed home

02:01:41.039 --> 02:01:43.405
No one's left here but me

02:01:43.475 --> 02:01:48.378
And I will sing out your name

02:01:50.081 --> 02:01:54.484
Call me insane I know

02:01:54.552 --> 02:01:59.285
I've opened my heart
and my soul to you, son

02:01:59.357 --> 02:02:04.021
So pale turns the innocent

02:02:04.095 --> 02:02:07.861
And all I feel

02:02:07.932 --> 02:02:11.595
Is pain

02:02:13.538 --> 02:02:17.565
Suddenly I understand

02:02:17.642 --> 02:02:19.940
He's gone

02:02:20.011 --> 02:02:23.003
Blind my eyes and I still can see

02:02:23.081 --> 02:02:25.709
Through the mist to the very end

02:02:25.784 --> 02:02:29.083
There I'll face what I fear the most

02:02:29.154 --> 02:02:34.319
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter right now

02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:40.591
But it all doesn't matter right now
