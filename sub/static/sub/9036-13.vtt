WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:12.246
- HONEY, YOU UP?
- HMM?

00:12.280 --> 00:15.149
- OH!
I HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.088
HEY, THERE'S NO KIDS
IN BED WITH US, FOR A CHANGE.

00:21.555 --> 00:25.359
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE--
- OH, GOD, I DON'T FEEL SO WELL.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.128
- [sighs]

00:27.161 --> 00:30.331
HEY, YOU USUALLY DON'T SAY THAT
UNTIL AFTER.

00:34.302 --> 00:37.771
- NO, I MEAN IT, RAY.
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.141
OH, GOD, I'M SO HOT.
[groans]

00:42.610 --> 00:44.478
- WELL, I DON'T--

00:44.512 --> 00:46.247
I'M GETTING
ALL THESE MIXED SIGNALS.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.618
[babies crying]
- AW, HONEY, THE KIDS.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.320
- I KNOW, THEY'RE FINE.
THEY'RE FINE.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.854
- OH, RAY,
COULD YOU GET THE KIDS, PLEASE?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.423
- [groaning]

00:59.527 --> 01:02.330
ALL THIS DISCUSSION.
WE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.301
HI, I'M RAY,

01:07.335 --> 01:08.636
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:08.669 --> 01:10.171
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.539
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:11.572 --> 01:13.641
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.576
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.245
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:17.278 --> 01:20.481
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.151
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.154
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.521
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.624
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.859
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:31.892 --> 01:33.727
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.529
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:35.563 --> 01:37.731
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.100
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.842
MOMMY'S NOT FEELING TOO GOOD.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.779
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

01:51.812 --> 01:56.284
- NOTHING.
BELIEVE ME, NOTHING.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.686
- I THINK MOMMY'S
GOT THE FLU, SWEETIE.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.654
RAY, I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO HELP ME TODAY.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.889
- ALL RIGHT. I'LL--

02:01.922 --> 02:03.324
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.625
MY TERRY BRADSHAW MEETING.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.360
- OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.262
- I--OH, NO!

02:08.296 --> 02:10.764
IF I GET TO GHOSTWRITE
HIS BOOK,

02:10.798 --> 02:14.335
I CAN AFFORD TO GET YOU
ROUND-THE-CLOCK NURSING CARE.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.869
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU,
MOMMY.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.371
- OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.340
- OH, SEE, LOOK AT HER.
ISN'T SHE SWEET?

02:19.373 --> 02:20.808
DON'T KIDS JUST
CHEER YOU RIGHT UP?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.343
- YEAH.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.645
- YOU'RE LOOKING A LOT
PEPPIER RIGHT NOW.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.415
- RAY, LISTEN,

02:27.448 --> 02:29.517
I'M STARTING
TO GET CHILLS NOW, SWEETIE.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.185
YOU BETTER GET
THAT THERMOSCAN.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.253
- THERMOSCAN?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.354
- THE THERMOMETER,

02:33.387 --> 02:34.655
SO WE KNOW WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.723
- "KNOW WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH?"

02:35.756 --> 02:37.425
THAT'S HOSPITAL TALK.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.659
STOP.
THINK POSITIVE.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.628
THINK POSITIVE.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.231
STOP THAT HOSPITAL--
KITCHEN TALK.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.598
LIKE, WHAT WOULD RAY
WANT FOR BREAKFAST

02:44.632 --> 02:46.667
BEFORE HIS BIG MEETING?

02:48.869 --> 02:52.906
- ALLY, ALLY, THE JUMPING
IS MAKING MOMMY SICK, HONEY.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.375
- STOP, ALLY.
THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S ENOUGH.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.377
HERE, LOOK, READ THIS.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.578
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S VICTORIA'S SECRETS.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.812
THAT'S DADDY'S.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.449
HERE, READ THIS.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.483
THIS IS THE THERMOMETER?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.917
- YEAH.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.586
- ALL RIGHT,
SHOULD I SET IT TO "STUN"?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.521
- NO, HERE,
GIVE IT TO ME.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.522
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH THAT?

03:08.556 --> 03:09.523
WHERE DO YOU PUT THAT?

03:09.557 --> 03:10.691
- YOU PUT IT IN YOUR EAR.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.860
- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
MY THIRD GUESS.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.230
- OH, HONEY, LOOK,
IT'S ALMOST 103.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.666
- NO. 103.
- YEAH.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.335
- IT'S A SCALE.
THAT'S WHAT YOUR HEAD WEIGHS.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.804
IT'S NOT.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.541
COME ON, JUST LAUGH.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.842
LAUGH, A LITTLE LAUGH.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.312
LAUGHTER IS
THE BEST MEDICINE.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.314
A PRIEST AND A RABBI
ARE LEG-WRESTLING--

03:33.347 --> 03:34.448
- RAY.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.685
FACE IT.
I'M SICK, HONEY.

03:37.718 --> 03:42.456
- BUT, OH, THIS IS MY ONE SHOT
WITH TERRY BRADSHAW.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.493
HEY, CAN'T YOU
WALK IT OFF?

03:45.526 --> 03:46.627
- WALK IT OFF?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.429
- THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER
ALWAYS TOLD ME.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.265
THAT, AND RUB
SOME DIRT ON IT.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.833
- RAY, LISTEN,
COME ON, I'M SICK.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.535
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HELP ME.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.636
- I KNOW.
OF COURSE, I KNOW.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.637
I'M JUST--

03:56.670 --> 03:58.872
PANICKING!

03:58.906 --> 04:00.874
ALL RIGHT, REST.
LOOK, JUST YOU REST.

04:00.908 --> 04:05.446
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
SO THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.947
I'LL DO--I'LL START
THE BREAKFAST.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.516
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, ALLY,
COME ON.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.917
- HERE.
- MOMMY'S NOT FEELING GOOD.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.784
WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE BREAKFAST.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.486
COME ON, GUYS.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.654
YOU JUST TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.022
I GOT IT
ALL UNDER CONTROL.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.758
A LITTLE EASY
ON THE THROAT, ALLY.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.564
HEY, LOOK, YOU'RE UP.
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.566
- NO.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.303
I JUST GOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU
DOWN HERE UNSUPERVISED.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.406
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALLY?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.007
- ALL I DID WAS
GIVE HER BREAKFAST.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.709
THAT'S ALL I DID.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.478
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE'S BURNING UP.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.313
SHE'S HOT.
SHE'S LIKE YOU. SHE'S SICK.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.548
- OH, COME HERE, HONEY.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.749
- OKAY.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.984
- NOT YOU.
ALLY.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.590
- I'M HERE.
DON'T WORRY.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.894
OH, GOD,
LOOK AT YOU, DEBRA. UGH.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.934
- GOOD MORNING, MARIE.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.636
WELL, RAY,
YOUR MOM'S HERE.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.104
- I--I THOUGHT
SHE COULD COME BY,

05:04.137 --> 05:04.838
AND SHE COULD HELP YOU
WITH THE KIDS

05:04.872 --> 05:06.807
WHILE I'M
AT MY BIG MEETING.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.808
WASN'T THAT A GOOD IDEA?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.744
- AH, YEAH,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.915
HOW ABOUT IF I BITE
YOUR NOSE REALLY HARD?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.787
- THAT'S THE NYQUIL TALKING.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.922
- RAY, LISTEN,
ALLY'S GOT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.756
NOW, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO HERE?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.024
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.394
- MICHAEL'S HOT TOO.
- WHAT?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.995
- OH, THAT'S WHAT COMES
FROM VITAMINS

05:28.028 --> 05:31.565
SHAPED LIKE
CARTOON CHARACTERS.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.866
- GEOFFREY'S FINE.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.635
- NO, THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU DO IT.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.937
COME HERE, BABY.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.840
YEAH, HE'S FINE.
OKAY.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.742
NOW--NOW--

05:41.775 --> 05:44.678
NOW, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
MICHAEL AND ALLY

05:44.712 --> 05:46.079
TO THE DOCTOR RIGHT NOW,

05:46.113 --> 05:48.716
AND I'LL STAY HERE
WITH DEBRA AND GEOFFREY.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.084
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

05:51.118 --> 05:55.623
I DON'T WANT YOU--
GETTING SICK.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.491
- OH, I DON'T GET SICK, DEAR.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.560
- MOM'S MORE OF A CARRIER.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.561
- GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.396
GO GET DRESSED AND TAKE
THE KIDS TO THE DOCTOR.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.931
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
ALLY, COME ON, GO, GO UP.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.799
OH, MY TERRY BRADSHAW MEETING!

06:05.833 --> 06:07.968
I CAN'T JUST BLOW HIM OFF.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.969
- WHO'S THAT?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.404
- THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.539
HE'S VERY FAMOUS.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.640
HE'S IN THE HALL OF FAME.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.675
HE WON FOUR SUPER BOWLS.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.876
- I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.046
- I HAVE A BIG MEETING
WITH HIM!

06:19.079 --> 06:20.614
ALL RIGHT. FORG--

06:20.648 --> 06:21.682
DON'T WORRY.
LOOK, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.550
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.651
- YEAH, WOULD YOU
JUST CALL HAMMOND?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.018
- HAMMOND?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.620
- DR. HAMMOND,
THE KIDS' DOCTOR.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.889
- RIGHT, DR. HAMMOND,
THE GUY WITH THE GOOD LOLLIPOPS.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.123
OKAY.
I'LL CALL HIM.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.459
- YEAH.
HIS NUMBER--

06:31.492 --> 06:32.560
HIS NUMBER'S
IN THE BOOK, HONEY.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.894
- ALL RIGHT.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.996
- IN THE KITCHEN.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.834
IN THE DRAWER.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.005
BY THE REFRIGERATOR.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.976
- YEAH, YOU GOT NOTHING NOW.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.979
- COME HERE.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.481
COME HERE, LET ME
TAKE YOUR TEMPERATURE.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.049
- NO, I THINK I'M FINE.
NO, PLEASE, DON'T.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.885
- 103.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.555
- WHOA.
- OH, YEAH.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.960
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LONG THIS IS TAKING.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.896
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
TERRY BRADSHAW RIGHT NOW.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.731
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.865
- I WAS UP ALL NIGHT

07:11.899 --> 07:13.667
CLEANING VOMIT
OFF AN ANTIQUE QUILT.

07:15.536 --> 07:19.206
- OKAY, IT'S A BAD DAY
FOR ALL OF US.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.842
HOW OLD IS HE?
LET ME GUESS: TEN MONTHS.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.544
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.679
HE'S GOT A NICE SHAPED HEAD.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.014
WAS HE--
STILL GOT THOSE SOFT SPOTS?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.782
- YEAH.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.584
- YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS GOT TO
CHECK THOSE WHEN THEY'RE BORN.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.853
MAKE SURE THAT SPOT GOES IN,
YOU KNOW,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.254
BECAUSE IF IT COMES OUT,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.624
THAT MEANS THEY'VE BEEN
TAMPERED WITH.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.563
LOOK, MICHAEL,
LOOK OVER THERE.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.532
LOOK AT THAT PRETTY
LITTLE GIRL.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.601
- HE'S A BOY.
- OH, SORRY, SORRY.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.670
I GOT THROWN
BY ALL THE PINK.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.238
AND THE EARRINGS.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.544
- DADDY,
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

07:56.577 --> 08:00.080
- I KNOW. I KNOW, HONEY.
HERE, HERE.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.149
LET'S TRY AND TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF IT, OKAY?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.751
LET'S LOOK AT THIS.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.985
OH, HERE,
LOOK AT THIS PAGE.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.687
"WHAT DOESN'T BELONG?"

08:06.720 --> 08:09.189
PUPPY, KITTEN,

08:09.222 --> 08:11.692
CHIPMUNK, BIRD,

08:11.725 --> 08:13.827
FROG...

08:13.861 --> 08:15.696
TERRY BRADSHAW.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.964
- RAY BARONE?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.700
- HEY, HI.
HI, TERRY.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.934
HOW ARE YOU?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.003
- THIS IS WHERE
YOU WANT ME TO MEET YOU?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.938
- WELL--YEAH, I--

08:24.972 --> 08:26.273
LISTEN, I KNEW YOU HAD
A PLANE TO CATCH,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.141
AND I REALLY WANTED US
TO GET TOGETHER.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.743
AND THEN THIS--
THIS THING CAME UP,

08:29.777 --> 08:31.579
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY

08:31.612 --> 08:34.548
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PUT
ANYTHING IN YOUR MOUTH.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.583
HONEY, COME HERE.
HONEY, COME HERE.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.784
LOOK, THIS IS TERRY BRADSHAW.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.851
THIS IS THE MAN
DADDY'S GOING TO TALK TO

08:37.885 --> 08:39.553
ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.189
- HELLO!

08:42.222 --> 08:43.323
- HELLO.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.859
- YO, TERRY!
HEY, HEY.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.128
STEELERS RULE, MAN!

08:50.664 --> 08:51.832
- HEY, LISTEN,
RAY, I'M SORRY.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.933
I MEAN,
I READ YOUR COLUMN, MAN.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.568
I LOVE YOUR COLUMN,
BUT, I MEAN,

08:54.602 --> 08:55.703
I JUST DON'T THINK THIS THING
IS GOING TO WORK OUT.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.870
- TERRY, I UNDERSTAND.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.005
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
OUT OF THE ORDINARY,

08:58.038 --> 08:59.172
BUT THERE WAS NO WAY
AROUND THIS.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.674
I REALLY THINK
IT CAN WORK OUT.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.909
WE CAN JUST--

09:01.942 --> 09:02.910
LOOK, WE'LL JUST TALK
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.945
HERE, HERE,
SIT HERE.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.346
I'LL SIT HERE.
HONEY, SIT DOWN.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.682
I'M GOING TO
TALK TO THE MAN.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.084
- [clears throat]

09:18.191 --> 09:20.661
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.930
- [laughing]
I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO THIS.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.164
- ALL RIGHT.
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.265
WE DON'T HAVE TO SIT.
WE'LL JUST TALK.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.700
- LISTEN, I JUST DON'T--

09:26.734 --> 09:28.035
I JUST DON'T THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.837
I MEAN, I DON'T NORMALLY
DO BUSINESS LIKE THIS.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.639
- I KNOW. OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
YOU DON'T. I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.206
AND, LOOK, I WOULDN'T HAVE--
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS

09:33.240 --> 09:34.808
IF I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

09:34.842 --> 09:36.176
FOR ME AND FOR YOU.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.778
I GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS,
REALLY.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.280
REAL QUICKLY, I THINK
THE BOOK SHOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS

09:40.313 --> 09:42.783
THE PUBLIC HAS
ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.118
- CAN I TOUCH YOUR HEAD?

09:47.821 --> 09:48.989
- HEY, GIRL,
LOOK AT THIS.

09:49.022 --> 09:49.790
[blows raspberry]

09:49.823 --> 09:51.892
- [whining]

09:51.925 --> 09:53.293
- OKAY, ALL YOU KIDS.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.896
- RAY, RAY, RAY.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.330
HEY, LOOK, YOU KNOW,

09:57.364 --> 09:58.966
I CAN SEE YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HANDS FULL HERE.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.100
- I KNOW. I KNOW I DO.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.269
BUT I STILL THINK WE CAN
JUST TALK FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.072
- MR. BARONE, YOU WANT TO BRING
ALLY AND MICHAEL IN NOW, PLEASE.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.907
- HEY, HEY,
NICE MEETING YOU, RAY.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.175
- THANKS, I THINK
WE DID SOMETHING HERE.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.276
- RAY, I'M SORRY, MAN.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.277
- ALL RIGHT.
WE HAD A GOOD MEETING.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.712
WE LAID A LITTLE FOUNDATION.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.647
I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE
CALL YOUR PEOPLE.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.650
- YOU DO THAT!
- OKAY.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.951
WHO AM I KIDDING?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.120
THIS IS MY PEOPLE.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.832
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THE CHILDREN GOT SO SICK.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.234
I MEAN, YOU DO PUT COATS
ON THEM, DON'T YOU?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.703
- NO, MARIE,
I SEND THEM OUT

10:35.736 --> 10:39.106
STRAIGHT FROM THE TUB
BUCK NAKED.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.874
YES, OF COURSE
THEY WEAR COATS.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.242
- WHAT COATS?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.244
- THE COATS
THAT YOU BOUGHT THEM.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.213
- I NEVER SEE THEM
WEARING THEM.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.015
NOW, I KNOW YOU NEVER
LIKED THOSE COATS,

10:48.048 --> 10:49.349
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH

10:49.382 --> 10:50.984
ENDANGERING YOUR CHILDREN'S
HEALTH

10:51.018 --> 10:52.786
JUST TO SEND ME A MESSAGE.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.387
- THEY WEAR THE COATS.
[coughing]

10:54.421 --> 10:55.756
- HERE, HERE.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.892
YOU KNOW, THEY ARE
VERY EXPENSIVE COATS.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.093
- THEY'RE GOOD.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.895
THEY'RE GOOD, WARM COATS.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.931
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.432
I BOUGHT BAD COATS.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.801
- NO, THEY'RE--
THEY'RE FINE, MARIE.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.002
I JUST NEED TO REST NOW.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.170
- HERE, HERE, BLOW.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.743
YOU KNOW, I BOUGHT THOSE COATS
FROM FRANK'S FRIEND LEON.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.211
HE SAID IT WAS A DEAL,
THAT CROOK.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.114
HE SOLD ME PAPER COATS!

11:21.148 --> 11:23.817
- IF I COULD JUST
MAKE IT TO THE PHONE.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.818
- OH, I SHOULD NEVER
LISTEN TO FRANK.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.253
"BUY FROM LEON,"
HE SAID.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.121
"LEON HAS QUALITY
MERCHANDISE."

11:28.155 --> 11:29.723
WHAT HE DOESN'T SAY

11:29.757 --> 11:31.691
IS THAT LEON
WANTS TO KILL MY GRANDCHILDREN.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.495
- WHERE'S THE KETCHUP
IN THIS HOUSE?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.364
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:37.397 --> 11:38.932
- LOOKING FOR KETCHUP.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.901
- THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

11:40.934 --> 11:42.435
IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT DEBRA
AND THE KIDS ARE SICK.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.837
- WHAT?

11:43.871 --> 11:45.305
- YOUR FRIEND LEON
WITH HIS CHEAP COATS.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.107
- THOSE COATS
WERE VERY EXPENSIVE!

11:47.140 --> 11:48.809
- HE MADE EVERYONE SICK.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.043
- PLEASE, MY HEAD.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.079
- OR HOW ABOUT THOSE
$9 SLACKS?

11:52.112 --> 11:54.314
- YOU LOVED THE COLOR!
- THEY RIPPED THE FIRST DAY!

11:54.347 --> 11:55.849
- I DIDN'T READ
THE THING!

11:55.883 --> 11:57.317
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SIT IN THEM.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.752
THEY'RE NOT
SIT-DOWN SLACKS.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.990
- OH, PLEASE,
YOU ARE ACTUALLY KILLING ME.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.491
- SEE? YOU SEE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO HER?

12:04.524 --> 12:06.093
SHHH.
GO, GO, GO, GO, PLEASE.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.394
SHE NEEDS HER REST.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.062
- SHE SHOULD BE UP
AND MOVING AROUND.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.764
SHE SHOULD
WALK IT OFF!

12:10.798 --> 12:11.531
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

12:11.564 --> 12:13.300
YOU AND YOUR CHEAP COATS.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.968
I KNOW WHAT SICK PEOPLE NEED.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.469
THEY NEED REST
AND PEACE AND QUIET.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.206
- ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW WHERE THE KETCHUP IS.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.942
UPPER LEFT,
REFRIGERATOR DOOR.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.443
UPPER LEFT.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.778
- THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO KNOW.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.781
FEEL BETTER, SWEETHEART.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.116
- KETCHUP!

12:34.354 --> 12:36.156
- IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. BARONE.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.091
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.094
- THAT'S 'CAUSE DEBRA LOVES
THIS PART OF BEING A PARENT.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.196
DO YOU KNOW, DOES THIS PHONE
DIAL OUT?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.031
- WHY, IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.365
- YEAH, YEAH.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.299
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF CALLING THE GUY

12:46.333 --> 12:49.369
WHO LEFT WITH MY...
CAREER.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.472
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

12:52.505 --> 12:53.506
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.810
I JUST WANT THE KIDS
TO GET BETTER, THAT'S ALL.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.112
DON'T WORRY.
DADDY'S HERE. OKAY?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.447
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

13:00.480 --> 13:01.915
SOMETIMES
I NEED A LITTLE HELP

13:01.949 --> 13:03.550
RESTRAINING THE CHILDREN
WHEN I'M EXAMINING THEM.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.119
- RESTRAINING THE CHILDREN?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.989
YOU ARE A REAL DOCTOR,
RIGHT?

13:09.022 --> 13:09.990
- HOW YOU FEELIN', ALLY?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.424
- CRUMMY.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.559
- OH, SHE UPGRADED HERSELF.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.962
THIS MORNING SHE WAS ICKY.

13:14.995 --> 13:15.963
- WHAT'S SHE BEEN
EATING LATELY?

13:15.996 --> 13:17.464
- OH, UH--

13:17.497 --> 13:19.266
GOOD THINGS.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.168
YEAH. LOTS OF--

13:21.201 --> 13:23.070
LOTS OF GREEN STUFF.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.907
SOMETIMES HOT
AND SOMETIMES COLD.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.908
DEBRA--

13:27.941 --> 13:30.210
DEBRA--DEBRA DOES THAT,
MOSTLY.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.311
- WHAT ABOUT HER
SLEEPING HABITS?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.913
- OH, THAT I KNOW.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.514
I KNOW THAT
'CAUSE I READ HER A BOOK

13:34.547 --> 13:37.384
AND I TUCK HER IN
RIGHT ABOUT 8:00.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.020
WELL, IF I'M NOT
AT THE GAME--

13:40.053 --> 13:41.221
WORKING, WORKING.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.589
I'M A SPORTS WRITER,
YOU KNOW.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.623
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.557
NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS,

13:44.591 --> 13:47.427
DOES SHE WAKE UP A LOT
DURING THE NIGHT?

13:47.460 --> 13:51.098
- I'M--I'M A PRETTY HEAVY
SLEEPER, YOU KNOW, SO--

13:51.131 --> 13:54.935
I--IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT TREE
FALLING IN THE FOREST THING,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.203
YOU KNOW?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.639
BUT I READ HER
THE BOOKS,

13:59.672 --> 14:02.275
AND I SING HER THE DUCK SONG,
RIGHT, HONEY?

14:02.309 --> 14:03.276
* LITTLE DUCKS

14:03.310 --> 14:04.277
* BIG DUCKS

14:04.311 --> 14:05.545
* LOTS OF

14:05.578 --> 14:08.048
* SWINGIN' DUCKS

14:09.616 --> 14:11.484
- YOU HAVE
A LOVELY VOICE.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.519
DEEP BREATH.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.021
- [wheezing]

14:14.054 --> 14:15.655
- SHE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF
CHILDREN WHO ARE SICK?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.891
- YES.
IN YOUR WAITING ROOM.

14:17.925 --> 14:21.094
OH, GOD, IT'S LIKE
A HOT ZONE OUT THERE,

14:21.128 --> 14:22.429
I'LL TELL YOU.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.097
- I MEAN THE CHILDREN
SHE PLAYS WITH.

14:24.131 --> 14:27.234
- WELL, UH, DEBRA,
SHE ARRANGES THE PLAY DATES,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.102
BUT THEN I GO
AND I PICK HER UP.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.437
RIGHT, SOMETIMES?

14:30.470 --> 14:34.141
- WHEN YOU'RE HOME.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.643
- YOU SOUND LIKE
A TYPICAL DAD.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.646
- NO, NO.
I'M A VERY GOOD DAD.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.048
YEAH,
I GO ON THE ROAD A LOT,

14:41.081 --> 14:42.215
BUT THEN,
WHEN I COME HOME,

14:42.249 --> 14:45.652
THEN THEY'RE ALL MINE,
RIGHT?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.254
LIKE WHAT'D WE DO LAST WEEK?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.089
WHAT'D WE DO?

14:49.122 --> 14:51.024
WE WENT TO THE VIDEO STORE,
AND WE GOT YOUR FAVORITE VIDEO.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.061
THAT'S WHY THEY LIKE IT
WHEN IT'S DADDY'S DAY.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.096
LIKE MY WIFE ONLY LETS THEM
WATCH IT ONCE, YOU KNOW.

14:56.129 --> 15:01.468
I'LL LET 'EM WATCH THAT
AS MANY TIMES AS THEY WANT.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.104
THEY LOVE IT.
OH, IT'S GREAT.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.373
MAN, THEY CAN SIT IN FRONT OF
THAT THING FOR HOURS.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.507
OHH.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.508
RIGHT?

15:08.541 --> 15:09.943
WE HAVE FUN, DON'T WE?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.212
AND--
AND ALLY'S FAVORITE VIDEO--

15:12.245 --> 15:14.281
THE LITTLE MERMAID.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.383
- NO.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.018
- RIGHT!

15:18.051 --> 15:19.953
[chuckles]

15:19.987 --> 15:21.288
IT'S THE SAME THING.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.326
- ALLY, HONEY, I'M GOING TO TAKE
A LOOK IN YOUR EARS NOW, OKAY?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.727
- OKAY.
- CAN YOU HOLD HER FOR ME?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.129
- YEAH.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.198
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.199
- [whimpering]

15:32.232 --> 15:33.400
- OKAY.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.468
DOCTOR'S MAKING ME
DO THIS.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.238
THIS IS THE DOCTOR'S FAULT,
OKAY?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.440
DADDY IS STILL A GREAT MAN.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.275
- THERE WE GO.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.444
THAT'S IT.
ALL DONE.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.713
GO GET YOURSELF
A LOLLIPOP.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.415
ALLY SEEMS TO HAVE
A TOUCH OF THE FLU.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.716
- YEAH.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.618
- LET'S SEE HOW
LITTLE MICHAEL'S DOING.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.420
- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
GOING TO BE THE SAME THING TOO.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.587
HE'S GOT
THAT SAME FEVER,

15:54.621 --> 15:58.091
SAME SNIFFLES,
SAME CRUMMINESS.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.228
OH, BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THESE KIDS.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.696
- MR. BARONE,
MICHAEL SEEMS FINE TO ME.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.232
- I THINK
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.499
- NO, I'M TELLING YOU,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.535
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT CHILD.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.503
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THIS MORNING...

16:28.355 --> 16:30.190
- FEELING BETTER, HONEY?

16:30.223 --> 16:33.193
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT GARLIC ACTUALLY HELPS.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.762
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

16:35.795 --> 16:38.065
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
AN OLD WIVES' TALE.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.267
- LOOK WHO
YOU'RE TALKING TO.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.237
- HONEY, BUTTON UP
YOUR SWEATER.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.339
LET'S CLOSE YOUR ROBE.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.575
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CATCH A CHILL.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.410
NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN GET FOR YOU?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.512
- WELL, MAYBE I'LL GO
UPSTAIRS FOR A WHILE.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.047
- NO, YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.482
I'LL GO STRAIGHTEN OUT
THE COVERS.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.516
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.285
- I KNOW.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.287
I'VE BEEN ORDERING YOU AROUND
A LOT TODAY, BUT--

17:00.320 --> 17:02.255
WHEN ONE OF YOUR OWN
IS SICK,

17:02.289 --> 17:04.791
YOU HAVE TO FORGET ABOUT
WINNING A POPULARITY CONTEST.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.393
- YOU'RE IN NO DANGER.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.694
- OHH!

17:09.629 --> 17:11.264
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU GET BETTER.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.565
- THANKS, MARIE.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.334
IT'S NICE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
FOR A CHANGE.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.069
THANK YOU.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.105
- WELL, WE'RE BOTH MOTHERS.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.073
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT MUCH
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.675
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

17:22.709 --> 17:26.079
- I DON'T WANT TO SAY
THE WRONG THING.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.747
- WE'RE THE SAME,
AREN'T WE, FRANK?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.350
- OH, YEAH.
YOU'RE EXACTLY THE SAME.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.352
LIKE ME AND FABIO.

17:32.385 --> 17:38.125
- [laughing]

17:38.158 --> 17:41.161
- YOU SEE,
FRANK THINKS SO TOO.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.362
- OKAY.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.530
- OH.
- HI.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.533
- I'M BACK WITH
ALL THE RIGHT CHILDREN.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.634
- HOW ARE THE KIDS?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.302
- DADDY SAID
WE COULD WATCH TV

17:49.336 --> 17:51.638
UNTIL WE GET BETTER.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.707
- DR. HAMMOND SAID THEY'LL BE
FINE IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.511
AND HE WAS AMAZED AT
HOW IDENTICAL THESE TWINS ARE.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.648
YOU KNOW, IF THEY
EVER NEED X-RAYS,

18:01.681 --> 18:03.750
I BET WE ONLY
HAVE TO BRING IN ONE.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.123
IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.592
- YEAH, LIKE FATHER
KNOWS BEST.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.662
- YOU BROUGHT THE WRONG KID.

18:15.695 --> 18:19.166
[laughter]

18:19.199 --> 18:21.801
- I KNOW! I KNOW!

18:21.834 --> 18:24.471
- WELL, I NEVER MIXED UP
YOU AND ROBERT.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.839
- YES, YOU DID, DAD.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.641
- OH, RIGHT.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.785
- HEY, HEY,
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.153
- YEAH, MUCH BETTER,
THANKS.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.154
- OH, GOOD, GOOD.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.789
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHIRT?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.625
- OH, I WAS GIVING THE KIDS
THEIR MEDICINE.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.829
THEY LOVE THAT STUFF.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.931
[telephone rings]

18:51.964 --> 18:53.866
- HELLO.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.303
OH, YES, HE IS.
JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.470
IT'S TERRY BRADSHAW.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.839
- COME ON.
- YEAH.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.475
- HI.
TERRY, YEAH.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.810
WELL, I'M--

19:03.843 --> 19:05.545
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.414
YEAH.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.783
WELL, YOU KNOW, BEING A PARENT
IS THE TOUGHEST THING.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.186
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:13.220 --> 19:15.888
NO, I NEVER HAD TO SEE
MEAN JOE GREEN NAKED.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.593
YEAH, YEAH. WELL--

19:20.627 --> 19:22.562
WELL, YOU KNOW, THANKS,

19:22.595 --> 19:24.864
BUT MY KID'S STILL A LITTLE SICK
AND MY WIFE'S STILL SICK,

19:24.897 --> 19:28.635
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK SO.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.869
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANKS.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.872
OKAY, TERRY, BYE.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.209
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.810
- HIS PLANE WAS DELAYED
A FEW HOURS,

19:37.844 --> 19:40.547
AND HE WANTED ME
TO COME VISIT HIM AT THE HOTEL,

19:40.580 --> 19:41.648
AND I TOLD HIM,
UH, YOU KNOW--

19:41.681 --> 19:43.316
- WHAT?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.317
- I TOLD HIM.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.287
I TOLD HIM
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.456
- YOU TOLD HIM
TO FORGET IT?

19:49.489 --> 19:50.957
- I TOLD HIM
I CAN'T MEET HIM TONIGHT.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.860
I'M GOING TO HELP YOU.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.562
- WHAT, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

19:55.595 --> 19:57.464
YOU'RE GOING TO
PASS THIS UP?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.998
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M HERE.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.501
I'M HELPING YOU WITH THE KIDS,
WITH THE MEDICINE.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.702
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

20:02.735 --> 20:04.671
NOT THE MEDICINE,
BUT, UH--

20:04.704 --> 20:09.742
- GET TERRY BACK ON THE PHONE
BEFORE HE HIRES SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.544
- IS THIS A TEST?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.280
IS THIS A--

20:13.313 --> 20:14.647
YEAH.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.416
YEAH! THIS IS LIKE
THE TIME YOU TOLD ME

20:16.449 --> 20:18.818
I COULD GO TO BERNIE'S
BACHELOR PARTY.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.387
- IT'S NOT LIKE
TERRY BRADSHAW'S

20:20.420 --> 20:22.922
GOING TO GIVE YOU
A LAP DANCE, RAY.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.857
- I'M JUST SAYING,
I DON'T GET YOU.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.459
DON'T YOU--
AREN'T YOU UPSET

20:26.493 --> 20:27.927
THAT I DON'T KNOW THE KIDS
AS WELL AS YOU?

20:27.960 --> 20:28.995
- NO, RAY.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.630
I MEAN, LOOK,
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.433
I NEEDED YOU THIS MORNING,
AND YOU WERE THERE FOR ME,

20:33.466 --> 20:37.770
AND NOW I NEED YOU TONIGHT
TO GO MAKE THE MONEY.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.273
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL CALL HIM.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.608
BUT AM I A BAD FATHER

20:41.641 --> 20:43.410
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE KIDS' DOCTOR IS

20:43.443 --> 20:45.478
OR WHAT ALLY
HAS FOR LUNCH

20:45.512 --> 20:48.381
OR HOW LONG YOU BREAST-FED
THE TWINS FOR?

20:48.415 --> 20:49.982
BY THE WAY, I TOLD THE DOCTOR
YOU STOPPED, RIGHT?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.351
- YEAH, SIX MONTHS AGO.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.919
- RIGHT.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.523
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE LESS
CROWDED AROUND THERE.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.791
- RAY, COME HERE.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.928
I MEAN, LOOK, HONEY,

21:01.961 --> 21:03.530
SO YOU DON'T KNOW
SOME THINGS, YOU KNOW?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.031
BUT--BUT YOU'RE TRYING,

21:05.064 --> 21:07.334
AND YOU CARE,
AND YOU WORK HARD,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.936
AND, YEAH, I MEAN,
YOUR JOB TAKES YOU AWAY A LOT,

21:09.969 --> 21:11.338
BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR JOB

21:11.371 --> 21:14.374
YOU WERE ABLE TO PAY
THE DOCTOR TODAY.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.645
- I WAS SUPPOSED
TO PAY HIM TODAY, RIGHT?

21:18.678 --> 21:21.748
- YEAH.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.717
COME HERE.
TAKE MY TEMPERATURE.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.954
- HEY, YOU'RE FEELING
A LOT COOLER.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.722
- YEAH.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.324
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE

21:31.358 --> 21:33.326
"DOCTOR AND THE PATIENT."

21:33.360 --> 21:35.395
- RAY.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.963
- OH, MRS. BARONE,

21:36.996 --> 21:38.565
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR CLOTHES OFF?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.333
I'M THE DENTIST.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.434
- RAY.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.504
COME ON.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.373
COME ON, RAY.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.640
- WHAT?

21:47.674 --> 21:49.642
- 'CAUSE I'M BETTER,
BUT I'M TIRED.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.710
- OH.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.111
WELL, HOW TIRED
ARE YOU?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.780
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.882
- [laughing]
I'M TIRED.

21:55.915 --> 21:56.983
GO AWAY.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.818
- ALL RIGHT.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.619
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.588
I'LL WALK IT OFF.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.024
- YEAH, OR RUB
SOME DIRT ON IT.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.100
- I'M GLAD WE FINALLY GOT
SOME TIME TO DO THIS.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.669
I KNOW WE'VE BOTH BEEN
VERY BUSY.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.571
OKAY, SO--

22:18.605 --> 22:19.906
SO TELL ME--

22:19.939 --> 22:22.375
OF ALL THE PLACES
YOU'VE PLAYED,

22:22.409 --> 22:24.076
WHERE WOULD YOU SAY
IS YOUR FAVORITE?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.746
- IN MY ROOM.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.417
- ROOM. OKAY.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.553
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
MOMMY KISS THE CABLE MAN?
