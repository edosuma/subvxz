04:19.382 --> 04:20.216
Hello?

04:25.755 --> 04:26.590
Hello?

04:35.932 --> 04:36.767
Hello?

05:34.257 --> 05:35.356
Bentley, come here, come on.

05:35.358 --> 05:36.890
Knock it off, get outta here.

05:36.892 --> 05:37.726
Get out.

05:37.728 --> 05:38.726
Come on, let's go.

05:38.728 --> 05:40.296
Damn it, Bentley.

05:46.103 --> 05:48.339
Up you go, little princess.

05:49.438 --> 05:51.438
Is that everything?

05:51.440 --> 05:53.207
Yeah, as
far as I can tell.

05:53.209 --> 05:58.212
Good, 'cause this boat is
leaving the dock in two minutes!

05:58.214 --> 06:00.414
Olivia, honey, please
don't jump on the bed.

06:00.416 --> 06:04.251
This camper is old, I don't
wanna break Grandpa's new toy.

06:04.253 --> 06:05.452
This isn't new.

06:05.454 --> 06:07.222
Well, it's new to Grandpa.

06:07.224 --> 06:07.858
Off.

06:09.892 --> 06:11.092
Steve, where's your brother?

06:11.094 --> 06:12.827
We gotta get on the road.

06:12.829 --> 06:14.061
Taking his sweet time.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.462
Honey, please don't start.

06:15.464 --> 06:17.198
You promised.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.036
Yeah,
honey, you promised.

06:21.471 --> 06:22.840
Really, Jay?

06:26.409 --> 06:29.310
This is a real
peace of shit, Dad.

06:29.312 --> 06:31.145
Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay!

06:31.147 --> 06:32.880
What's up, snugglebug?

06:32.882 --> 06:34.015
Hey Steve,
come get your dog!

06:34.017 --> 06:36.250
How's my little girlfriend?

06:36.252 --> 06:37.452
How are you?

06:39.389 --> 06:41.255
Bentley, come here!

06:41.257 --> 06:42.493
Bentley, come on.

06:45.394 --> 06:46.327
Sorry about that, Carl.

06:46.329 --> 06:49.029
He was about to
shit on my lawn again.

06:49.031 --> 06:49.931
Sorry about that.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.166
Oh, no worries.

06:51.168 --> 06:52.002
Nice RV.

06:52.935 --> 06:55.469
Have a good day, Carl.

06:55.471 --> 06:57.238
Hey, hey, excuse me.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.472
I'm looking for my son.

06:58.474 --> 07:00.108
He's 13, brown hair.

07:00.110 --> 07:02.342
He was wearing jeans and a
black T-shirt, riding his bike.

07:02.344 --> 07:04.945
He just didn't come home
last night, did you see him?

07:04.947 --> 07:06.347
Uh, gosh no, I haven't.

07:06.349 --> 07:08.284
I'll keep an eye out.

07:09.486 --> 07:10.851
Okay, thank you.

07:10.853 --> 07:11.488
Uh-huh.

07:14.558 --> 07:16.024
Come on, Bentley, get in here.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.058
God, he does not like this RV.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.294
What did that woman want?

07:19.296 --> 07:20.495
Ah, she was just
looking for her son.

07:20.497 --> 07:21.863
I guess he didn't
come home last night.

07:21.865 --> 07:22.597
I hope she finds him.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.231
Yeah, I know.

07:24.233 --> 07:25.200
Well, should
I whip these horses

07:25.202 --> 07:26.400
and get this coach rollin'?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.001
I don't know,
Pop, does it start?

07:28.003 --> 07:29.503
Jay, come on.

07:29.505 --> 07:31.306
This old mare
has a few years left in her.

07:31.308 --> 07:32.606
Yeah, but does it start?

07:32.608 --> 07:34.512
It's a fair question.

07:40.317 --> 07:41.548
Oh.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.918
Just give her a chance, alright?

07:55.298 --> 07:56.531
That's my girl!

07:57.433 --> 07:58.368
I told you!

09:12.309 --> 09:15.045
Hey Pop, thanks
for doin' this.

09:18.147 --> 09:19.579
Mom would have
loved this for us.

09:19.581 --> 09:21.985
Yeah, yeah, she would have.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.428
Mama, it's hot.

09:33.430 --> 09:35.329
I know, baby.

09:35.331 --> 09:37.564
Honey, can you please
turn the air conditioner on?

09:37.566 --> 09:39.936
It's on, check the vent.

09:41.403 --> 09:44.240
Yeah, it's just
blowing hot air.

09:49.512 --> 09:51.212
It's not cold up here either.

09:51.214 --> 09:52.612
I know you guys are too
young to remember this,

09:52.614 --> 09:54.448
but back in my day
we used to open

09:54.450 --> 09:56.586
the window to get fresh air.

10:00.256 --> 10:03.193
Well that's strange,
it won't open.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.294
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

10:07.296 --> 10:09.230
Hey Dad, I'm curious.

10:09.232 --> 10:12.199
Back in your day on your road
trip with Moses and Jesus

10:12.201 --> 10:14.568
to the Grand Canyon,
how'd you get fresh air

10:14.570 --> 10:17.170
if you couldn't get
the windows open?

10:17.172 --> 10:20.140
Hey, check the
ones back there.

10:22.112 --> 10:24.044
This one won't budge.

10:24.046 --> 10:25.615
Can you try that one?

10:35.057 --> 10:36.024
This thing's like glued shut.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.661
I doubt it's been open in years.

10:46.802 --> 10:48.068
What happened there?

10:48.070 --> 10:48.702
What?

10:48.704 --> 10:50.571
I loosened it for ya.

10:50.573 --> 10:52.076
Thanks, Daddy.

11:23.839 --> 11:25.640
Well, okay.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.718
Mommy, I'm hungry.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.754
I know, honey.

11:39.756 --> 11:40.721
I'm almost done.

11:40.723 --> 11:41.755
Here.

12:07.783 --> 12:11.087
Honey, keep your
fanny on the seat.

12:12.522 --> 12:13.656
You know better.

12:27.603 --> 12:29.871
Honey, keep your
fanny on that seat!

12:30.772 --> 12:31.805
Olivia!

12:32.642 --> 12:33.776
What happened?

12:35.844 --> 12:36.811
You're okay, honey.

12:36.813 --> 12:40.213
You just gotta be more
careful next time, okay?

12:40.215 --> 12:41.649
Did it get ya?

12:41.651 --> 12:42.750
No.

12:42.752 --> 12:43.918
She's okay.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.755
Hey, how about we go over
there and we watch a little TV?

12:47.757 --> 12:50.560
I'm sorry, hon,
the TV's broken.

12:52.929 --> 12:58.102
Be sure you keep your fingers
inside, okay little bear?

12:58.734 --> 12:59.668
You know what?

12:59.670 --> 13:01.501
You wanna go see what
Bentley is doing?

13:01.503 --> 13:03.504
I bet Bentley wants to play.

13:03.506 --> 13:04.438
Yeah?

13:04.440 --> 13:05.740
And then I'll finish your lunch.

13:05.742 --> 13:08.245
Alright honey, go see Bentley.

13:24.359 --> 13:25.592
Alright everybody, we're about

13:25.594 --> 13:27.827
30 minutes away
from our first stop.

13:27.829 --> 13:28.962
What's there?

13:28.964 --> 13:31.365
Cave paintings.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.268
Some going back to
our prehistoric times.

13:34.270 --> 13:36.770
Amazing, can't wait.

13:36.772 --> 13:40.308
I thought it might be nice
to see some of our history.

13:40.310 --> 13:42.842
I'm sorry if it's not
cool enough for you, Jay.

13:42.844 --> 13:44.779
Sounds pretty cool to me.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.447
Me too.

13:46.449 --> 13:49.549
Yeah, Dad, I think we'd
all like to see that.

13:49.551 --> 13:52.452
Hey Jay, can you give me
a hand with something?

13:52.454 --> 13:53.589
Yeah, why not.

13:56.693 --> 13:58.893
Make sure you finish eating
your carrots, okay honey?

13:58.895 --> 13:59.696
Okay.

14:01.863 --> 14:03.831
Hey Olivia, guess what?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.298
What?

14:05.300 --> 14:07.768
Inside the cave, they
found some animal bones

14:07.770 --> 14:10.874
belonging to a
Shasta ground sloth.

14:11.741 --> 14:13.640
What's that?

14:13.642 --> 14:16.776
It's like a big
white fluffy bear

14:16.778 --> 14:18.913
that has a long neck and a tail,

14:18.915 --> 14:20.914
and it smiles all the time.

14:24.454 --> 14:25.653
I don't care, Jay.

14:25.655 --> 14:26.754
We can do without
your little comments.

14:26.756 --> 14:27.587
What comments?

14:27.589 --> 14:28.789
Really?

14:28.791 --> 14:30.390
Look, I know you
don't wanna be here,

14:30.392 --> 14:31.659
but can you at least pretend

14:31.661 --> 14:32.459
to enjoy yourself
just a little bit?

14:32.461 --> 14:33.693
I am pretending.

14:33.695 --> 14:34.861
Then maybe you can do
a better job for Dad.

14:34.863 --> 14:35.730
For Dad?

14:35.732 --> 14:36.597
Really?

14:36.599 --> 14:38.031
What the fuck did
he ever do for us.

14:38.033 --> 14:39.502
Guys, please.

14:42.338 --> 14:46.606
Look Jay, we've all been
through a lot this last year.

14:46.608 --> 14:47.908
I know you're hurting.

14:47.910 --> 14:49.909
I miss her too.

14:49.911 --> 14:51.444
But I can't help but
think this is Dad's way

14:51.446 --> 14:54.481
of trying to bring the
three of us back together.

14:54.483 --> 14:57.887
If you can't do it
for Dad, do it for me.

14:59.454 --> 15:02.456
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt,
but your Dad's stopping.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.290
He's stopping?

15:03.292 --> 15:04.024
Mhmm.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.525
Dad, why are we stopping?

15:05.527 --> 15:06.894
There's a car up
ahead that's pulled off

15:06.896 --> 15:08.663
on the side of the road.

15:08.665 --> 15:10.831
Looks like they
might need some help.

15:28.718 --> 15:31.018
I'm gonna see if they
need anything, alright?

15:31.020 --> 15:32.319
Who's they?

15:32.321 --> 15:34.755
There's no one around.

15:34.757 --> 15:38.893
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea, Dad.

15:38.895 --> 15:42.329
Hey fellas, if it was us,
I'd really appreciate it

15:42.331 --> 15:44.631
if somebody stopped
to help, huh?

15:44.633 --> 15:45.899
Come on.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.504
Whatever, knock yourself out.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.550
I don't know what the hell
he thinks he's gonna do.

16:03.552 --> 16:05.752
Dad doesn't know
shit about cars.

16:05.754 --> 16:06.920
Steve does.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.088
Since when?

16:08.090 --> 16:10.057
Daddy
changed the tire once.

16:10.059 --> 16:12.125
That's what I thought.

16:12.127 --> 16:14.895
There's no one around, Dad.

16:14.897 --> 16:17.798
Maybe somebody came by
and picked 'em up already.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.867
Well, I still think we
should have a look, Steve.

16:20.869 --> 16:21.704
Come on.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.712
Steve, Steve, come here.

16:29.579 --> 16:30.414
Come here.

16:35.017 --> 16:35.982
Jesus Christ!

16:35.984 --> 16:36.917
Sorry.

16:36.919 --> 16:39.019
Uh, what the hell are you doing?

16:39.021 --> 16:42.358
Take it easy, we
just stopped to help.

16:43.526 --> 16:44.391
Hey, you okay?

16:44.393 --> 16:45.992
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:45.994 --> 16:47.761
Hey, I apologize.

16:47.763 --> 16:49.029
We just saw your truck
on the side of the road

16:49.031 --> 16:51.131
and thought maybe we
could lend a hand.

16:51.133 --> 16:52.933
Well then, thank you, I guess.

16:52.935 --> 16:55.669
My name's Charlie,
this is my son, Steve.

16:55.671 --> 16:56.506
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:57.473 --> 16:59.539
- Sorry.
- Hi, I'm Mark.

16:59.541 --> 17:00.941
This is my sister, Sam.

17:00.943 --> 17:03.010
Nice to meet you.

17:03.012 --> 17:04.944
So what seems
to be the problem?

17:04.946 --> 17:06.781
Oh, dude, you're
looking at the wrong guy.

17:06.782 --> 17:08.549
Sam's the mechanic
in the family.

17:08.550 --> 17:09.949
I just got the good looks.

17:09.951 --> 17:11.017
I think we blew a head gasket,

17:11.019 --> 17:13.586
but I'm not gonna know
until I get it to a shop.

17:13.588 --> 17:14.988
Yeah, we tried calling
a tow truck earlier,

17:14.990 --> 17:16.723
but we can't get
a signal out here.

17:16.726 --> 17:17.957
You're honestly the first people

17:17.959 --> 17:18.992
we've seen in the
last few hours.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.630
Yeah, I'll bet.

17:21.596 --> 17:23.730
Well, look, if you don't mind,

17:23.732 --> 17:26.132
I mean, grab what you
need and lock it up

17:26.134 --> 17:27.200
and leave it here.

17:27.202 --> 17:29.136
We'll be happy to drop
you off at the next town.

17:29.138 --> 17:30.103
You can find a service station

17:30.105 --> 17:31.805
or mechanic that can help you.

17:31.807 --> 17:33.107
As long as you don't mind making

17:33.109 --> 17:34.042
a little bit of a side trip.

17:34.044 --> 17:36.209
We're on our way to
see some cave paintings

17:36.211 --> 17:38.512
as part of our family trip.

17:38.514 --> 17:39.149
Yeah.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.056
Are you sure your
family doesn't mind?

18:19.788 --> 18:20.623
Oh shit!

18:58.527 --> 18:59.161
Sam?

19:02.097 --> 19:03.666
Hey, what happened?

19:08.671 --> 19:09.506
You okay?

19:12.874 --> 19:14.143
I don't know.

19:15.076 --> 19:17.578
Something's not right.

19:17.580 --> 19:20.080
I'm getting a weird feeling.

19:20.082 --> 19:21.748
Well the next
town can't be far.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.986
We'll stop off and get
what we need and go, okay?

19:25.988 --> 19:26.820
Okay.

19:26.822 --> 19:28.155
Okay.

19:28.157 --> 19:29.192
Oh, hi.

19:31.326 --> 19:32.825
What's your name.

19:32.827 --> 19:34.861
Olivia.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.098
Cool, I'm Mark.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.099
I like your doll.

19:39.101 --> 19:40.767
Shh, she's sleeping.

19:40.769 --> 19:42.004
Oh, oh, okay.

19:43.805 --> 19:46.109
It's nice to meet you, Olivia.

19:48.276 --> 19:49.709
You guys doing okay?

19:49.711 --> 19:50.945
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

19:50.947 --> 19:53.750
Everybody hold on,
this is our turn!

19:57.719 --> 19:58.721
Oh, sorry.

20:20.910 --> 20:23.043
There should be a
map in the glove box.

20:23.045 --> 20:23.880
Okay.

20:25.948 --> 20:26.783
Mhmm.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.821
Is that it?

20:33.823 --> 20:34.658
Yeah.

20:35.857 --> 20:37.390
You sure this is
the right turnoff?

20:37.392 --> 20:38.193
Well.

20:42.698 --> 20:43.764
We've been driving five hours

20:43.766 --> 20:44.864
and now you put on your glasses?

20:47.068 --> 20:49.705
Does that say 6M27, no, 6ML27?

20:54.677 --> 20:55.278
It does.

20:57.046 --> 20:58.211
Bingo.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.713
That's the one, baby.

20:59.715 --> 21:00.714
That's what we've
been looking for.

21:00.716 --> 21:01.782
We're only 10 or
15 minutes away.

21:01.784 --> 21:02.619
Perfect.

21:04.754 --> 21:05.753
Everybody ready?

21:05.755 --> 21:06.387
Let's do it, Pop.

21:06.389 --> 21:07.220
Ready!

21:07.222 --> 21:09.255
Here we go.

21:38.353 --> 21:39.320
You know, I just wanna say

21:39.322 --> 21:41.755
I really appreciate you
guys giving us a lift.

21:41.757 --> 21:43.357
Well, you're welcome.

21:43.359 --> 21:44.293
Actually, I'm
really looking forward

21:45.324 --> 21:45.993
to seeing these cave paintings.

21:45.995 --> 21:47.030
We are too.

21:52.767 --> 21:55.302
Hey Dad, you said 15
minutes 30 minutes ago.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.438
I know, I know, it
should be right up ahead.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.273
Or way behind us by now.

21:59.275 --> 22:01.742
It says it's five miles
from the highway, Dad.

22:01.744 --> 22:03.243
Yeah, but listen,
I've only been driving

22:03.245 --> 22:06.280
10 or 15 miles an hour with
all these bumps and rocks.

22:06.282 --> 22:07.948
Yeah, for over 30 minutes.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.483
Do the math, we passed it.

22:09.485 --> 22:12.852
He's right, we
need to turn around.

22:12.854 --> 22:14.088
Dad, why you speeding up?

22:14.090 --> 22:16.323
I don't know,
I'm not doing it!

22:16.325 --> 22:17.424
Hold on!

22:20.429 --> 22:22.228
Hit the brakes, Dad!

22:22.230 --> 22:24.401
I am, it's not stopping!

22:26.434 --> 22:27.269
Mom!

22:41.382 --> 22:45.185
I don't
know what's wrong.

22:45.187 --> 22:46.352
Dad, hit the brakes!

22:46.354 --> 22:49.025
I'm trying,
dammit, I'm trying!

24:57.452 --> 24:59.553
You're not gonna get
reception, we're too far out.

24:59.555 --> 25:00.486
I know.

25:00.488 --> 25:01.354
What are we supposed to do?

25:01.356 --> 25:02.421
There is a dead
man and we're stuck

25:02.423 --> 25:03.657
in the middle of nowhere.

25:03.659 --> 25:05.057
Shit!

25:05.059 --> 25:06.025
Mommy.

25:06.027 --> 25:07.261
I'm sorry, baby.

25:07.263 --> 25:08.428
I tried turning
the engine over,

25:08.430 --> 25:11.198
but something blew
just before the crash.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.032
Mommy.

25:12.034 --> 25:13.266
Hold on.

25:13.268 --> 25:14.200
We're gonna be
out here for days

25:14.202 --> 25:16.203
or weeks before anyone comes by.

25:16.205 --> 25:17.536
This place isn't
exactly a tourist trap.

25:17.538 --> 25:18.572
Mommy?

25:18.574 --> 25:19.409
What?

25:21.442 --> 25:22.609
Honey, I am sorry.

25:22.611 --> 25:24.210
What's wrong?

25:24.212 --> 25:25.447
Bentley's gone.

25:27.216 --> 25:28.051
Great.

25:36.225 --> 25:40.494
I think Bentley just
went out for a little walk.

25:40.496 --> 25:43.130
I'm sure he'll be
back real soon.

25:43.132 --> 25:43.964
Promise?

25:43.966 --> 25:45.332
Oh, I promise.

25:45.334 --> 25:46.169
Yeah?

25:56.378 --> 25:58.477
Closest town is 45 miles out.

25:58.479 --> 26:02.983
Nobody can make that
walk in this heat, Dad.

26:22.603 --> 26:24.670
What about the highway?

26:24.672 --> 26:29.141
Am I the only one
thinking about the dead guy?

26:58.574 --> 27:00.176
Don't touch me!

27:02.210 --> 27:03.576
I told him something was wrong.

27:03.578 --> 27:04.680
I told him.

27:06.547 --> 27:08.017
Don't touch me.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.354
You killed him!

27:13.654 --> 27:14.723
You did this.

27:15.690 --> 27:18.124
You and your goddamn camper.

27:26.634 --> 27:29.171
Olivia.

27:45.153 --> 27:46.152
I'm gonna grab a water.

27:46.154 --> 27:46.786
Grab a couple.

27:46.788 --> 27:47.623
Okay.

28:01.069 --> 28:03.505
Up you go, little princess.

28:04.405 --> 28:06.406
Is that everything?

28:06.408 --> 28:07.607
As far as I can tell.

28:07.609 --> 28:12.682
Good, 'cause this boat is
leaving the dock in two minutes.

28:15.617 --> 28:17.149
Olivia, honey, please
don't jump on the bed.

28:17.151 --> 28:18.418
This camper's old.

28:18.420 --> 28:22.322
I don't wanna break
Grandpa's new toy.

28:22.324 --> 28:24.791
Well, it's new to Grandpa.

28:28.197 --> 28:29.032
Mommy?

28:30.199 --> 28:32.035
Baby, what happened?

28:51.420 --> 28:52.220
You okay?

28:53.689 --> 28:55.155
Hey.

28:55.157 --> 28:56.288
Olivia, can you please go see

28:56.290 --> 28:57.756
what Grandpa is doing, honey?

28:57.758 --> 28:58.795
Okay.

29:02.197 --> 29:03.796
You okay?

29:03.798 --> 29:05.765
Look at me, what's wrong?

29:05.767 --> 29:07.734
Get us outta here,
because I wanna go home.

29:07.736 --> 29:08.834
What happened?

29:08.836 --> 29:09.803
What happened?

29:09.805 --> 29:10.938
Are you joking?

29:10.940 --> 29:13.239
We crashed, we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere.

29:13.241 --> 29:16.676
Not too mention a man just
died in front of our daughter.

29:16.678 --> 29:17.847
Look at these.

29:18.747 --> 29:20.349
What are these?

29:22.484 --> 29:24.484
Your daughter just drew them.

29:28.489 --> 29:32.795
I'm telling you, there is
something going on in there!

29:34.462 --> 29:37.330
Do you think I wanted our
daughter to watch a man die?

29:37.332 --> 29:39.565
I wish to God she hadn't,
but I can't change that.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.767
I'm not a mechanic, I don't
know shit about engines.

29:41.769 --> 29:43.803
So baby, tell me, what the
hell do you want me to do?

29:43.805 --> 29:45.171
Figure it out!

29:45.173 --> 29:46.505
It's your job to
keep the family safe.

29:46.507 --> 29:47.474
You don't think I know that?

29:47.476 --> 29:48.710
I don't know.

29:50.278 --> 29:51.644
I know you don't
have all the answers,

29:51.646 --> 29:55.150
but I trust that you
will figure this out.

30:01.923 --> 30:02.757
Shit.

30:17.506 --> 30:19.742
Do you need anything?

30:35.556 --> 30:36.592
Yeah, I do.

30:38.893 --> 30:40.896
I need you to pop the hood.

30:45.866 --> 30:47.702
Come on, you coming?

31:04.853 --> 31:05.851
What do you think?

31:05.853 --> 31:08.487
I don't know, I can't tell.

31:08.489 --> 31:10.756
See if it'll start.

31:17.598 --> 31:18.433
Great.

31:19.468 --> 31:20.833
You think you can fix it?

31:20.835 --> 31:22.768
I don't know, I've looked
at it for two seconds.

31:22.770 --> 31:25.505
Why don't you give me some room?

31:25.507 --> 31:27.439
Sorry, I'm just
trying to help.

31:27.441 --> 31:30.880
So far your help
got my brother killed.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.617
Hey, pump the
gas and try again.

31:38.653 --> 31:40.820
You fucking piece
of shit, come on.

31:43.859 --> 31:45.358
Oh, there you go.

31:46.894 --> 31:47.696
What the?

31:49.030 --> 31:50.832
Screw this thing, man.

32:02.344 --> 32:03.743
Hey.

32:03.745 --> 32:05.248
Hey, look at this.

32:09.017 --> 32:09.884
What is this?

32:11.018 --> 32:13.555
There's something down here.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.022
Shit!

32:49.024 --> 32:50.622
Dad, are you alright?

32:50.624 --> 32:53.025
Shit, they got it started.

32:53.027 --> 32:54.761
How'd you guys get the engine...

32:59.468 --> 33:02.004
Oh my God, I'll
get some towels.

33:03.604 --> 33:04.903
Dad, come on.

33:04.905 --> 33:06.773
Watch your step, Dad, come on.

33:19.988 --> 33:21.019
Hold still.

33:21.021 --> 33:21.955
Oh, come on.

33:21.957 --> 33:22.755
I know, I know, I know.

33:22.757 --> 33:24.056
It hurts, oh God.

33:24.058 --> 33:25.158
I'm sorry.

33:29.765 --> 33:31.163
It's alright.

33:31.165 --> 33:33.533
Mommy, what
happened to grandpa?

33:33.535 --> 33:34.566
Oh, hon.

33:34.568 --> 33:35.401
Here.

33:35.403 --> 33:36.034
It's okay.

33:36.036 --> 33:37.504
Come on, honey.

33:37.506 --> 33:40.005
Grandpa's okay, he
just cut his arm.

33:40.007 --> 33:42.074
We gotta get Dad to a hospital
before he bleeds to death.

33:42.076 --> 33:44.710
How do you
suppose we do that?

33:47.114 --> 33:49.651
You'll be okay.

33:52.921 --> 33:53.753
Come on.

33:57.558 --> 33:59.124
God damn it!

33:59.126 --> 34:01.129
God damn this fucking RV!

34:02.730 --> 34:03.963
Steve, stop it!

34:03.965 --> 34:05.801
You're scaring Olivia!

34:26.020 --> 34:28.154
We gotta get the engine
started in the morning.

34:28.156 --> 34:29.489
It's fried.

34:29.491 --> 34:31.156
We got it started before.

34:31.158 --> 34:33.025
We can't keep it started.

34:33.027 --> 34:37.496
Well, we gotta get Dad to
a hospital thanks to you.

34:37.498 --> 34:38.665
Stop saying that.

34:38.667 --> 34:39.699
It was Dad who decided
to put his hand

34:39.701 --> 34:41.167
in the engine like an idiot.

34:41.168 --> 34:42.000
What'd you say?

34:42.002 --> 34:43.071
You heard me!

34:44.973 --> 34:45.804
Get off me!

34:45.806 --> 34:47.141
What the hell?

34:50.110 --> 34:52.612
I'm gonna go find
some more wood.

34:52.614 --> 34:53.449
Jesus.

35:01.589 --> 35:04.524
Mommy, is Grandpa
gonna be okay?

35:04.526 --> 35:07.096
Grandpa's gonna be just fine.

35:07.995 --> 35:10.165
I don't want you to worry.

35:11.232 --> 35:13.565
You need to get some
sleep, okay honey?

35:13.567 --> 35:14.500
Okay.

35:14.502 --> 35:16.069
Alright, good night.

35:16.071 --> 35:17.203
Good night.

35:17.205 --> 35:18.737
I love you.

35:18.739 --> 35:20.176
I love you too.

35:44.933 --> 35:46.232
Uh!

36:04.852 --> 36:05.687
Oh my God.

36:26.707 --> 36:29.043
Charles, how you holding up.

36:30.277 --> 36:32.645
My arm feels
like it's burning.

36:32.647 --> 36:34.650
Here, these will help.

36:48.196 --> 36:51.000
I actually think I'll join you.

36:52.232 --> 36:53.665
You can stay inside the RV,

36:53.667 --> 36:56.201
it's gonna get
pretty cold out here.

36:56.203 --> 36:57.103
Do you have a tent?

36:57.105 --> 36:59.105
Yeah, so Jay and
I'll stay in the tent...

36:59.107 --> 37:00.809
I'll take the tent.

37:01.843 --> 37:03.042
You sure?

37:03.044 --> 37:04.643
Yeah, I'm sure.

37:04.645 --> 37:05.281
Okay.

37:06.681 --> 37:08.982
I'll stay out here too.

37:08.984 --> 37:10.917
I don't need a babysitter.

37:10.919 --> 37:14.189
Didn't say you did,
but it's my tent.

39:02.497 --> 39:03.332
Hello?

39:09.169 --> 39:10.004
Hello?

39:15.109 --> 39:16.308
Hello?

39:42.469 --> 39:44.002
Samantha, calm down!

39:44.004 --> 39:44.839
It's me!

39:45.540 --> 39:46.375
Relax.

39:49.477 --> 39:50.308
Are you alright?

39:50.310 --> 39:52.346
No, I'm not alright.

40:24.212 --> 40:25.814
Olivia.

40:33.922 --> 40:36.022
I'm looking
for my son, for my son.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.181
How you feeling?

41:02.183 --> 41:03.949
Considering half
my forearm's gone

41:03.951 --> 41:06.518
and I've got a
hangover, not so good.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.886
Well, I'm gonna
grab the others.

41:07.888 --> 41:09.487
We can start working
on the engine.

41:09.489 --> 41:10.656
Ah, I'm gonna come with you.

41:10.658 --> 41:12.924
No, no, Dad, just sit
there for a little bit, okay?

41:12.926 --> 41:14.159
Just rest.

41:14.161 --> 41:15.393
I'll let you know
if we need you.

41:15.395 --> 41:16.228
Alright.

41:16.230 --> 41:17.064
Okay.

41:28.609 --> 41:30.245
Where's Samantha?

41:48.395 --> 41:50.663
You figure anything out?

41:50.665 --> 41:53.900
From what I can
see, it should work.

41:53.902 --> 41:55.533
Great.

41:55.535 --> 41:57.469
What do we do now?

41:57.471 --> 41:59.538
Well do you have any tools?

41:59.540 --> 42:00.505
Let me go look.

42:00.507 --> 42:01.310
Okay.

42:08.515 --> 42:10.449
Anything I can do?

42:10.451 --> 42:12.451
Do you know anything
about engines?

42:12.453 --> 42:13.685
Not really.

42:13.687 --> 42:15.223
Well then, no.

42:20.194 --> 42:22.627
Hey Dad, did you happen
to bring any tools?

42:22.629 --> 42:24.599
Look in the closet.

42:42.082 --> 42:42.917
Okay.

42:44.585 --> 42:48.657
We got the level or, uh,
gigantic rusty scissors.

42:51.359 --> 42:52.223
What do you want to use first?

42:52.225 --> 42:54.095
How 'bout the wrench?

43:04.205 --> 43:06.642
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

43:09.009 --> 43:11.210
Go get it and come
right back, okay?

43:11.212 --> 43:12.678
Okay, Mommy.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.511
Hi, Dad.

43:13.513 --> 43:14.682
Hey, monkey.

43:16.250 --> 43:17.616
You okay?

43:17.618 --> 43:18.453
Yeah.

43:21.522 --> 43:22.620
I'm gonna go talk to Jay.

43:22.622 --> 43:23.658
Okay.

43:29.263 --> 43:31.062
Have you ever been married?

43:31.064 --> 43:32.364
Me?

43:32.366 --> 43:33.200
No.

43:37.605 --> 43:39.071
Not really your thing?

43:39.073 --> 43:42.174
It just never
really worked out.

44:24.185 --> 44:25.020
Mommy!

44:27.754 --> 44:30.355
We should really be on
a sandy beach right now.

44:30.357 --> 44:33.625
Honestly, I think I've
had enough sand for a while.

44:33.627 --> 44:34.592
You make a good point.

44:34.594 --> 44:36.594
Mommy!

44:36.596 --> 44:39.098
Ah well, I should
go see what she wants.

44:39.100 --> 44:39.735
Okay.

44:46.140 --> 44:50.578
Hey, can one of you guys
turn over the engine for me?

44:57.652 --> 45:00.185
Mommy, please can
I use the jump rope?

45:00.187 --> 45:02.656
Yes, you can
use the jump rope.

45:04.491 --> 45:06.727
But only where I can see you.

45:08.361 --> 45:09.194
Okay.

45:09.196 --> 45:10.198
Thank you.

45:14.468 --> 45:16.768
Hey Pop, I gotta get in here.

45:16.770 --> 45:17.605
Alright.

45:20.674 --> 45:22.243
Alright, careful.

45:23.578 --> 45:26.748
Alright,
I got it, thanks.

45:36.491 --> 45:38.390
I just don't understand.

45:38.392 --> 45:40.792
Jay, try it again!

45:53.774 --> 45:55.641
Mommy, watch me.

45:55.643 --> 45:56.674
That's good, baby.

45:56.676 --> 45:58.544
Mommy, you're not watching.

45:58.546 --> 45:59.547
I see you.

46:01.781 --> 46:02.848
That's good.

46:58.839 --> 46:59.837
Jay, quit screwing around.

46:59.839 --> 47:00.875
Try it again.

47:08.515 --> 47:09.848
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:09.850 --> 47:10.683
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:10.685 --> 47:12.884
Go ahead, go, go, go.

47:14.388 --> 47:15.620
Yes!

47:15.622 --> 47:17.522
Now we can get the
hell outta here!

47:17.524 --> 47:19.693
Olivia, baby, come back!

47:42.750 --> 47:45.350
Olivia!

47:45.352 --> 47:47.454
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:48.788 --> 47:49.621
Baby?

47:49.623 --> 47:50.455
Olivia!

47:50.457 --> 47:51.757
Oh my God!

47:51.759 --> 47:52.924
She's under this!

47:52.926 --> 47:54.560
Olivia!

47:54.562 --> 47:55.493
Baby!

47:55.495 --> 47:57.763
Oh my God, you gotta get her!

47:57.765 --> 47:59.632
Put it in neutral,
put it in neutral!

47:59.634 --> 48:00.966
I'm trying, I'm trying!

48:00.968 --> 48:03.902
- Oh my God, my baby!
- Jay, put it in neutral!

48:03.904 --> 48:04.902
Jay, come on!

48:04.904 --> 48:05.937
I got it.

48:05.939 --> 48:06.772
It's in neutral.

48:12.946 --> 48:13.781
Come on!

48:37.305 --> 48:38.373
My God, no!

48:39.973 --> 48:41.008
No!

48:51.919 --> 48:53.419
You fucking idiot!

48:53.421 --> 48:54.886
You fucking ran
over my daughter!

48:54.888 --> 48:55.953
- Stop, no, stop!
- Steve, what are you doing?

48:55.955 --> 48:57.589
- Let him go!
- Stop, stop it!

48:57.591 --> 48:58.556
He killed my daughter!

48:58.558 --> 48:59.924
Stop it, what are you doing?

48:59.926 --> 49:02.761
You fucking got high and
you ran over my daughter!

49:02.763 --> 49:03.962
Stop!

49:03.964 --> 49:05.797
Let him go, you're
gonna kill him!

49:08.868 --> 49:10.939
You fucking killed her!

49:13.540 --> 49:15.977
You should have let me do it.

49:17.410 --> 49:19.444
You're a fucking idiot!

49:19.446 --> 49:20.848
You're worthless!

49:24.652 --> 49:28.053
I don't know what happened,
I didn't touch anything.

49:28.055 --> 49:29.823
You gotta believe me.

49:31.892 --> 49:32.926
I do.

50:42.562 --> 50:43.364
Steve.

50:44.964 --> 50:47.433
Stay the hell away from me.

52:49.089 --> 52:52.026
Don't you see
what's happening?

52:53.761 --> 52:55.129
It's what it wants.

52:59.132 --> 53:02.569
It took us out in the
middle of nowhere.

53:07.140 --> 53:09.276
It's slowly killing us.

53:11.277 --> 53:12.113
It?

53:13.814 --> 53:15.279
What do you mean, it?

53:15.281 --> 53:18.218
Honey, you're not
making any sense.

53:23.223 --> 53:26.561
Everything in this
camper's gonna die.

53:33.033 --> 53:35.199
Come on, let's get
you in the back bedroom

53:35.201 --> 53:37.305
so you can get some rest.

53:48.915 --> 53:50.852
Baby, don't leave me.

53:52.185 --> 53:54.051
I don't wanna be alone with her.

53:54.053 --> 53:54.988
With who?

53:55.989 --> 53:57.758
The girl on the TV.

53:58.792 --> 54:00.625
The girl on the TV?

54:00.627 --> 54:01.228
Yes.

54:07.201 --> 54:09.201
Okay, I need you
to do me a favor.

54:09.203 --> 54:10.902
I need you to lie down here
for a couple of minutes

54:10.904 --> 54:13.705
and rest while I go
outside and talk.

54:13.707 --> 54:15.609
Can you do that for me?

54:17.277 --> 54:19.310
And you'll come back?

54:19.312 --> 54:22.313
I promise, I'll
come right back.

54:22.315 --> 54:23.214
We're not gonna make it.

54:23.216 --> 54:25.850
Hey, don't say that.

54:25.852 --> 54:28.188
I'm gonna get us outta here.

54:46.707 --> 54:48.209
How's she doing?

54:49.042 --> 54:50.942
She's resting.

54:50.944 --> 54:52.210
We need to get the
hell outta here.

54:52.212 --> 54:54.745
Well, we're not driving out.

54:54.747 --> 54:57.248
Look, there's
only two options.

54:57.250 --> 54:59.384
Either we wait it out and
wait for somebody to find us.

54:59.386 --> 55:00.618
It's
never gonna happen.

55:00.620 --> 55:03.388
Or, one of us hikes to the
highway to flag someone down.

55:03.390 --> 55:04.321
We can't send
anybody to the highway,

55:04.323 --> 55:05.757
we don't have any water.

55:05.759 --> 55:07.792
Which is exactly why
one of us has to go.

55:07.794 --> 55:08.426
I'll go.

55:08.428 --> 55:09.261
No.

55:09.263 --> 55:10.728
Why not?

55:10.730 --> 55:11.328
Because you're an
irresponsible idiot.

55:11.330 --> 55:12.830
Fuck you, Steve.

55:12.832 --> 55:15.299
- Fuck you, Jay.
- Hey, you two, knock it off!

55:15.301 --> 55:17.034
If you guys don't
put this behind you,

55:17.036 --> 55:19.870
then we're not
getting out of here.

55:19.872 --> 55:21.105
I know you think
this is my fault

55:21.107 --> 55:22.174
and you'd rather it
was me back there,

55:22.176 --> 55:26.648
but Dad's hurt and you
need to be with your wife.

55:27.714 --> 55:28.882
Fine, do it.

56:21.835 --> 56:24.435
Mommy, please can
I use the jump rope?

56:24.437 --> 56:27.407
Yes, you can
use the jump rope.

56:28.475 --> 56:30.341
But only where I can see you.

56:43.357 --> 56:44.192
Olivia!

56:48.495 --> 56:49.460
Baby!

56:49.462 --> 56:50.995
Olivia!

56:50.997 --> 56:51.832
Olivia!

56:59.138 --> 57:00.938
Mommy, you're not watching.

57:00.940 --> 57:01.942
I see you.

57:03.442 --> 57:05.877
That's great, good job.

57:05.879 --> 57:07.279
Look at me!

57:07.281 --> 57:08.850
Olivia, look at me!

57:09.549 --> 57:10.383
Olivia!

57:11.484 --> 57:12.319
No, baby!

57:14.353 --> 57:15.922
Look at me, Olivia!

57:17.457 --> 57:18.392
No, Olivia!

57:21.495 --> 57:23.027
Look at me!

57:23.029 --> 57:23.864
Baby, no!

57:25.832 --> 57:27.431
Look at me!

57:42.616 --> 57:44.518
She's losing it, Dad.

57:46.886 --> 57:48.553
We're gonna get
through this, son.

59:04.497 --> 59:08.500
We should probably take what
food we have when we get...

59:08.502 --> 59:09.337
Oh my God!

59:10.504 --> 59:11.435
Oh my God!

59:11.437 --> 59:12.237
What, what, what's wrong?

59:12.239 --> 59:13.074
Jen, Jen!

59:26.352 --> 59:28.353
Steven.

59:28.355 --> 59:30.190
She's not breathing.

59:31.725 --> 59:32.690
Come on, baby, please.

59:32.692 --> 59:33.526
Breathe!

59:40.334 --> 59:41.399
Steve!

59:41.401 --> 59:42.667
Shut the fuck up!

59:42.669 --> 59:45.306
Don't you say it,
don't you say it.

59:53.547 --> 59:54.382
Steve.

59:55.482 --> 59:56.313
Steven.

59:56.315 --> 59:57.147
No, Dad.

59:57.149 --> 59:58.683
No, Dad, no!

59:58.685 --> 59:59.520
No, no!

01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:01.489
No, Dad!

01:00:02.522 --> 01:00:03.556
No, Dad!

01:01:13.759 --> 01:01:16.493
How long are we gonna
let him stay out there?

01:01:16.495 --> 01:01:18.495
As long as he needs.

01:01:18.497 --> 01:01:19.596
How long is that?

01:01:19.598 --> 01:01:21.766
He just lost his wife and kid.

01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:23.634
I think we can give
him a few minutes.

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.103
He's gonna lose a
father and a brother

01:01:25.105 --> 01:01:27.304
if we don't get some
fucking water soon.

01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:29.440
Have you always
been like this?

01:01:29.442 --> 01:01:30.511
Not always.

01:01:31.844 --> 01:01:34.679
Jay was a sweet young boy.

01:01:34.681 --> 01:01:38.850
I can't remember a time he
didn't have a smile on his face.

01:01:38.852 --> 01:01:42.754
He used to follow his mother
around like a little puppy dog.

01:01:42.756 --> 01:01:45.355
You two had something special.

01:01:45.357 --> 01:01:47.424
Yeah, we did.

01:01:47.426 --> 01:01:49.594
Never really had
that with you, Dad.

01:01:49.596 --> 01:01:50.364
Why is that?

01:01:51.765 --> 01:01:54.502
We did, you just
don't remember.

01:01:55.502 --> 01:01:57.402
Or you choose to forget.

01:01:57.404 --> 01:01:58.670
That's bullshit.

01:01:58.672 --> 01:02:00.737
There's nothing to forget,
you weren't around.

01:02:00.739 --> 01:02:01.772
I tried.

01:02:01.774 --> 01:02:03.373
No, you didn't.

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:05.310
You left when I was 14.

01:02:05.312 --> 01:02:06.544
I almost never saw you again,

01:02:06.546 --> 01:02:08.312
until a year after my
high school graduation,

01:02:08.314 --> 01:02:09.880
which you didn't
even show up for.

01:02:09.882 --> 01:02:10.882
You don't understand.

01:02:10.884 --> 01:02:12.783
No, you don't understand.

01:02:12.785 --> 01:02:14.618
When you left, you
broke her heart.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.752
You weren't around.

01:02:15.754 --> 01:02:16.756
I was there!

01:02:18.325 --> 01:02:21.292
After all you put her
through, she took you back.

01:02:21.294 --> 01:02:23.761
Did that even matter to you?

01:02:23.763 --> 01:02:25.696
You didn't deserve her.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.233
That's enough.

01:02:28.401 --> 01:02:31.803
I know, he looks like
a sweet old man, huh?

01:02:31.805 --> 01:02:34.839
He didn't even visit his
own wife in the hospital.

01:02:34.841 --> 01:02:36.607
So it wasn't much of
a surprise to anybody

01:02:36.609 --> 01:02:38.542
that he didn't show
up to the funeral.

01:02:38.544 --> 01:02:40.777
I said, that is enough.

01:02:40.779 --> 01:02:42.450
No, tell him, Dad.

01:02:43.817 --> 01:02:45.286
Tell me what?

01:02:46.218 --> 01:02:47.618
He needs to hear it from you.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.819
No.

01:02:48.821 --> 01:02:51.723
She's gone, Dad,
you can't protect her forever.

01:02:51.725 --> 01:02:52.826
Don't, Steven.

01:02:54.493 --> 01:02:58.731
Mom cheated on him two
years before he found out.

01:03:02.736 --> 01:03:03.804
Is that true?

01:03:05.705 --> 01:03:09.774
I loved your mother
since we were 15 years old.

01:03:09.776 --> 01:03:14.478
When I found out that
she was unfaithful to me,

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.183
I couldn't believe that
she would do that to me.

01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:20.520
I couldn't stay.

01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:24.821
What I didn't
understand was how much

01:03:24.823 --> 01:03:28.228
it was gonna effect
you and your brother.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:31.865
You knew?

01:03:35.801 --> 01:03:38.268
I owe you both an
explanation about the funeral.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.404
No, Dad, you don't.

01:03:40.406 --> 01:03:41.475
I do, I do.

01:03:50.951 --> 01:03:55.222
I got dressed, I was ready
to go, and I couldn't.

01:03:58.424 --> 01:04:00.658
'Cause I realized that if I did

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.393
I would be admitting
that she was gone

01:04:02.395 --> 01:04:05.629
and I was not ready to do that.

01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:07.467
I couldn't let her go.

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:16.276
This trip, this trip, she and
I planned this, the two of us.

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:20.777
Your mother and I planned this.

01:04:20.779 --> 01:04:23.484
She knew she wouldn't be here.

01:04:25.884 --> 01:04:30.687
She made me promise that
I would pull together

01:04:30.689 --> 01:04:34.391
one last time what was
left of our family,

01:04:34.393 --> 01:04:37.462
and that's what I've
been trying to do.

01:04:37.464 --> 01:04:38.696
Then let's do that.

01:04:38.698 --> 01:04:40.297
You and I will go together.

01:04:40.299 --> 01:04:41.833
Dad's gonna stay
here with Samantha.

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:43.904
Let's pack up a few things.

01:04:46.272 --> 01:04:48.374
You look good in plaid.

01:04:50.377 --> 01:04:51.212
What?

01:04:52.946 --> 01:04:56.482
The suit you wore
for your graduation.

01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:16.967
One more.

01:05:16.969 --> 01:05:18.738
That's it for food.

01:05:20.073 --> 01:05:23.674
Uh, pack
one, leave the rest.

01:05:23.676 --> 01:05:24.908
Can opener?

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:27.981
In one
of the drawers here.

01:05:37.857 --> 01:05:38.890
What's that?

01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:40.424
What?

01:05:40.426 --> 01:05:41.261
That?

01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:46.464
Jesus.

01:06:26.506 --> 01:06:28.672
Uh, Jay, can you
grab my flashlight.

01:06:28.674 --> 01:06:30.375
It's in my backback.

01:07:00.839 --> 01:07:01.642
Fuck!

01:07:03.176 --> 01:07:05.676
Did you catch
it on something?

01:07:05.678 --> 01:07:09.982
There's a whole bunch of
stuff stored back in there.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.835
Pictures.

01:08:26.893 --> 01:08:29.462
What the hell is all this shit.

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:34.968
This photo was
taken right there.

01:08:36.836 --> 01:08:38.069
These too.

01:08:38.071 --> 01:08:41.506
Dad, who the hell did
you buy this thing from?

01:08:44.277 --> 01:08:45.813
Is this the guy?

01:08:48.915 --> 01:08:50.180
No, that guy's too young.

01:08:50.183 --> 01:08:54.185
It's an old picture,
Dad, look at it again.

01:08:54.187 --> 01:08:57.024
Nah, this is
definitely not him.

01:09:29.087 --> 01:09:31.221
What the fuck is that?

01:10:03.288 --> 01:10:05.121
What the fuck was that?

01:10:05.123 --> 01:10:06.827
Let me see this.

01:10:09.962 --> 01:10:11.130
Wait a second.

01:10:22.308 --> 01:10:23.143
It's him.

01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:28.180
Robert Gunthry.

01:10:29.648 --> 01:10:31.281
Holy shit.

01:10:31.283 --> 01:10:32.883
You bought this thing
off Bob Gunthry?

01:10:32.885 --> 01:10:35.052
No, he didn't buy it from
Bob Gunthry, he's dead.

01:10:35.054 --> 01:10:37.821
The serial killer,
are you serious?

01:10:37.823 --> 01:10:40.024
This can't be the RV.

01:10:40.026 --> 01:10:41.859
I read in the newspaper
they were gonna destroy it

01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:44.195
outta respect for the
families of the victims.

01:10:44.197 --> 01:10:45.963
Look at all this shit.

01:10:45.965 --> 01:10:48.298
This has to be the same one.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.167
I remember what happened.

01:10:50.169 --> 01:10:54.170
The cops pulled over some
guy for a traffic stop.

01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:57.307
When they went inside
they found this woman

01:10:57.309 --> 01:11:01.347
with her hands screwed
to the ceiling, scalped.

01:11:03.181 --> 01:11:05.249
The guy attacked and
the cops shot him dead.

01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:07.888
Jesus Christ, this was his.

01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:11.825
We're in his goddamn toy box.

01:11:18.197 --> 01:11:19.864
That explains everything.

01:11:19.866 --> 01:11:21.298
That explains nothing.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.034
Wait.

01:11:23.036 --> 01:11:25.869
Please, don't say what I
think you're about to say.

01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:27.103
You're telling me
this RV's haunted?

01:11:27.105 --> 01:11:28.039
And there it is.

01:11:28.041 --> 01:11:29.774
You of all people should know.

01:11:29.776 --> 01:11:30.975
Why's that?

01:11:30.977 --> 01:11:32.375
Because you didn't
start the engine

01:11:32.377 --> 01:11:34.744
when it chewed your
Dad's hand off,

01:11:34.746 --> 01:11:39.249
you didn't throw it in reverse
when it ran over Olivia,

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:41.017
and your wife, she
couldn't have strangled

01:11:41.019 --> 01:11:43.253
herself to death
with a jump rope.

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:45.088
She would have passed out first.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:46.990
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:49.392
Uh, a serial killer
dies in here, and what?

01:11:49.394 --> 01:11:51.995
All of a sudden his RV is
magically killing people?

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:53.097
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.899
Wait, that makes sense to you?

01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:57.368
I told you, bro,
this wasn't my fault.

01:12:03.376 --> 01:12:04.741
Holy shit, Jay!

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.478
Oh my God.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.380
Oh God, no.

01:12:10.382 --> 01:12:11.848
God dammit, no!

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.185
Jay, Jay, Jay.

01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:16.786
Go, get outta here!

01:12:16.788 --> 01:12:18.856
Get out of this freaking thing!

01:12:21.794 --> 01:12:22.429
Oh shit.

01:12:23.362 --> 01:12:24.328
Oh my God, it won't open.

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:25.361
Get it open!

01:12:25.363 --> 01:12:26.297
It won't.

01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:28.432
What's going on, get it open!

01:12:28.434 --> 01:12:29.333
Steven!

01:12:29.335 --> 01:12:30.301
Steven, let me in!

01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:31.138
Steven!

01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:34.174
Door, Steven.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.742
Try the window.

01:12:39.845 --> 01:12:41.415
- Dad!
- I can't get it.

01:12:43.882 --> 01:12:45.382
Steven, open the door!

01:12:45.384 --> 01:12:46.851
Open the door!

01:12:46.853 --> 01:12:48.218
God damn it!

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.055
Fuck!

01:12:50.255 --> 01:12:51.090
Steven!

01:12:53.492 --> 01:12:54.325
Steven!

01:12:56.162 --> 01:12:57.794
Open the door, Steven!

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.475
Dad!

01:13:19.318 --> 01:13:20.551
It won't budge.

01:13:20.553 --> 01:13:22.189
Steven, Steven?

01:13:23.421 --> 01:13:24.454
Steven?

01:13:34.332 --> 01:13:35.799
How do I shut this thing off?

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:37.036
I don't know.

01:13:52.385 --> 01:13:53.487
No, Dad, run!

01:14:22.047 --> 01:14:23.783
Dad, I can't stop it!

01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:44.937
How do I stop it?

01:15:03.154 --> 01:15:03.989
Dad, run!

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:32.285
Dad!

01:15:36.554 --> 01:15:38.190
Steven, Steven!

01:15:40.593 --> 01:15:41.624
- Steven!
- Dad!

01:15:41.626 --> 01:15:43.263
Dad, you alright?

01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:46.096
I'm alright.

01:15:46.098 --> 01:15:48.935
Steven, what do
you want me to do?

01:15:51.569 --> 01:15:53.469
What are you gonna do?

01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:55.204
I'm gonna shoot
out the window.

01:15:55.206 --> 01:15:57.975
Dad, stand back, I'm gonna
shoot out the window!

01:15:57.977 --> 01:15:58.612
Alright.

01:16:06.585 --> 01:16:08.252
God dammit!

01:16:08.254 --> 01:16:09.619
God dammit!

01:16:09.621 --> 01:16:10.487
We have to get out of here,

01:16:10.489 --> 01:16:12.088
we're not safe
inside of this thing.

01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:14.057
How do you suppose
we do that, huh?

01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:16.727
How do we get out of this
God forsaken shit box?

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:17.664
God dammit!

01:16:19.431 --> 01:16:20.964
Steve!

01:16:20.966 --> 01:16:22.535
Steve, what can I do?

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.076
What do we tell him?

01:16:33.078 --> 01:16:34.311
What can he do?

01:16:34.313 --> 01:16:35.411
He can't get in,
we can't get out.

01:16:35.413 --> 01:16:37.080
Send him to the highway,
see if he can find help.

01:16:37.082 --> 01:16:37.748
No.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.115
Why not?

01:16:39.117 --> 01:16:40.517
Look at him, that's
fucking why not.

01:16:40.519 --> 01:16:42.119
He's gotta try.

01:16:42.121 --> 01:16:43.052
He won't make it.

01:16:43.054 --> 01:16:44.253
He's the only chance we have!

01:16:44.255 --> 01:16:45.521
He'll die.

01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:48.594
If he doesn't, he's
gonna die anyway.

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.232
Let me try.

01:16:56.202 --> 01:17:00.340
I don't know, Dad, do
you think you can make it?

01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:18.291
Yeah.

01:17:19.657 --> 01:17:20.660
Yeah, I can.

01:17:28.099 --> 01:17:30.401
Don't worry about us.

01:17:30.403 --> 01:17:33.436
I know you'll do your best.

01:17:33.438 --> 01:17:34.573
I love you, Dad.

01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.245
I love you too, son.

01:17:41.479 --> 01:17:43.148
You watch your back.

01:18:07.572 --> 01:18:09.306
We gotta find
a way outta here.

01:18:09.308 --> 01:18:13.410
I don't know what this
thing's capable of.

01:18:13.412 --> 01:18:14.781
What's happening?

01:18:16.549 --> 01:18:17.481
I don't know.

01:18:17.483 --> 01:18:18.781
Why are you doing that?

01:18:18.783 --> 01:18:20.386
I'm not doing it.

01:18:22.822 --> 01:18:25.621
I can't fucking control it.

01:18:33.799 --> 01:18:36.269
I can't fucking control it.

01:18:39.205 --> 01:18:39.837
Don't!

01:18:39.839 --> 01:18:40.838
I'm not doing it!

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.672
Stop that.

01:18:41.674 --> 01:18:43.443
I'm not doing it.

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:18.411
He's not moving.

01:19:25.751 --> 01:19:27.520
I shot my own father.

01:19:29.287 --> 01:19:31.223
Steve, it wasn't you.

01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:37.764
Steve, it's not your fault.

01:19:39.532 --> 01:19:41.134
You didn't do this.

01:19:48.273 --> 01:19:50.276
Steve, put the gun down.

01:19:53.245 --> 01:19:55.681
You need to put the gun down.

01:19:57.448 --> 01:20:00.750
Steven, please give me the
gun, you're making me nervous.

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:02.285
Steve, please, you're
making me nervous.

01:20:02.287 --> 01:20:04.820
Please just put the gun down.

01:20:12.898 --> 01:20:14.534
I love you son.

01:20:15.501 --> 01:20:16.336
Steven!

01:20:17.569 --> 01:20:18.401
No!

01:20:19.237 --> 01:20:19.872
No!

01:20:24.843 --> 01:20:26.513
Why did you do that?

01:20:38.724 --> 01:20:41.794
Why would you leave
me alone in here?

01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:52.431
Come on!

01:21:56.769 --> 01:21:57.570
Come on!

01:22:33.871 --> 01:22:34.906
Oh shit.

01:24:57.582 --> 01:24:58.417
Stop it.

01:24:59.151 --> 01:25:00.185
Stop it!

01:25:09.161 --> 01:25:09.996
Stop it!

01:25:13.564 --> 01:25:14.800
Leave me alone!

01:32:06.278 --> 01:32:09.215
Nice.

01:32:39.113 --> 01:32:44.113
