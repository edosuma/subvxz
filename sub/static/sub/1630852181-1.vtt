02:41.050 --> 02:42.284
Thanks.

02:49.551 --> 02:51.151
You from here?

02:51.284 --> 02:52.716
No.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.716
Where you from?

02:56.716 --> 02:58.084
Newhall.

03:01.317 --> 03:02.518
Where is that?

03:11.916 --> 03:13.317
We can make out.

03:14.084 --> 03:16.050
Maybe fuck, if you have time.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.351
No, I'm good.
I got to get back home.

03:27.284 --> 03:29.384
You're all right, it's not
because you're no hot or nothing

03:29.518 --> 03:31.017
I just got to back, you know.

03:35.050 --> 03:37.417
Mm, can I get another smoke?

03:40.384 --> 03:41.950
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

04:33.217 --> 04:34.716
Hey.

04:35.583 --> 04:36.917
Well, hello there.

04:37.050 --> 04:39.050
Hey, can you make
some fresh coffee?

04:41.351 --> 04:42.816
Why?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.816
There's none left.

04:46.451 --> 04:48.017
Hang on.

04:53.017 --> 04:54.749
This is Katie for Dad.

04:56.716 --> 04:59.484
<i>Dad for Katie,
everything all good? Over.</i>

04:59.617 --> 05:02.351
Need store backup. Over.

05:02.917 --> 05:04.716
<i>Two minutes. Over.</i>

05:11.184 --> 05:12.716
You going
to make the coffee or what?

05:12.850 --> 05:14.917
I can't leave the counter.

05:26.716 --> 05:28.084
Eight.

05:28.716 --> 05:30.417
Yeah. I know.

05:34.950 --> 05:38.084
So what? You've got
all day to stand around,

05:38.217 --> 05:39.817
waiting for a cup of coffee?

05:55.850 --> 05:57.384
Good job.

06:05.984 --> 06:07.783
Where are you headed?

06:08.217 --> 06:09.817
Newhall, sir.

06:10.984 --> 06:12.783
You from here?

06:13.716 --> 06:15.884
- Yes, sir.
- Huh.

06:28.117 --> 06:30.084
I know this one...
I know this one.

06:31.451 --> 06:33.217
It's November Rain.

06:36.151 --> 06:37.417
Yes!

07:43.284 --> 07:44.717
Don't.

08:12.550 --> 08:14.151
Stop it.

08:14.284 --> 08:15.583
Stop.

08:15.717 --> 08:17.717
Stop it.

08:21.383 --> 08:23.151
This is my son.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.817
- Hey, can I get a pack?
- Yeah.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.383
Hey, how's your brother?
He good?

08:34.517 --> 08:37.617
Russell is all right.
Still no job but...

08:38.251 --> 08:40.717
Oh, well, tell him
Martha's husband Ronnie,

08:40.817 --> 08:44.317
he's manager at...
Jesus, at Fairtrade.

08:44.450 --> 08:46.550
They need help
unloading boxes on Monday.

08:46.850 --> 08:49.550
Oh, okay cool.
Yeah, I'll let him know.

08:49.717 --> 08:53.717
All right.
Hey, uh, the Hacks boy,

08:54.184 --> 08:56.350
came in here this morning.

08:57.217 --> 09:00.284
just strolled
on in and had a cup of coffee.

09:03.950 --> 09:05.517
Dad, mom needs
you to move the truck.

09:05.717 --> 09:07.117
- Okay.
- Hey, babe?

09:07.251 --> 09:09.217
Hey, sorry, I was working,
I meant to text you.

09:09.350 --> 09:10.884
No worries.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.316
Girl, we gotta do your roots.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.084
You want me
to come over next week?

09:14.217 --> 09:17.217
Yeah, sure.
Let's go, come on.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.284
Lesbos.

09:22.151 --> 09:25.084
So wait... wait a minute,
he is out or he will be out?

09:25.217 --> 09:26.850
He is out.

09:27.450 --> 09:29.017
Shit.

09:31.817 --> 09:33.316
I don't even remember
what he looked like,

09:33.450 --> 09:35.017
Was he the redhead?

09:35.151 --> 09:37.350
Didn't his brother
like commit suicide?

09:39.917 --> 09:42.618
Yeah. I guess. I don't know.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.717
I don't ev...
I don't even remember.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.450
You know I don't
even know if I care.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.750
Of course you care.
What are you talking about?

09:51.483 --> 09:53.251
What does Russell say?

09:54.251 --> 09:55.517
Fucking pig.

09:58.717 --> 10:01.483
Hey, I can lend you the 50
bucks now if you still need it.

10:01.618 --> 10:05.517
Dude, really?
Ah, you're awesome. Thank you.

10:06.151 --> 10:07.584
Yeah. Actually,
I might need some help

10:07.717 --> 10:09.650
- after daycare this week.
- Yeah.

10:09.783 --> 10:13.217
Russell watches him, but it
makes me nervous sometimes.

10:14.084 --> 10:16.783
Here, forgot to put that back
in his diaper bag

10:16.917 --> 10:20.117
and these are for you.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.316
Oh, shit.
Where did you get those?

10:23.450 --> 10:25.683
I love those. Thanks.

10:31.483 --> 10:33.151
I gotta go.

10:38.283 --> 10:42.117
Hey man. I'm sorry
about that shit man, okay.

10:43.483 --> 10:48.650
Look, it's just,
uh - it's okay. I'm good.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.350
- Is she alright?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

10:52.483 --> 10:54.416
She'll be fine.
She asleep right now,

10:54.551 --> 10:56.151
I just gave her meds.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.618
We didn't
have proper introduction.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.750
I'm-I'm Jayden,
um, I'm her nurse,

11:02.884 --> 11:04.984
her caretaker,
whatever you wanna call me.

11:05.117 --> 11:07.350
I'm here pretty much
every day for a few hours.

11:07.484 --> 11:09.984
So if you see me again,
you don't have to like,

11:10.551 --> 11:12.450
you know, kick my ass.

11:14.084 --> 11:15.383
Look, if you gonna stick around,

11:15.518 --> 11:18.316
maybe, um, do me
a favor, feed those dogs.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.283
Honestly,
they scare the shit out of me.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.350
All right.

11:23.484 --> 11:26.250
Also too, if you can,
ah, there's a number

11:26.383 --> 11:28.151
on the refrigerator,
if you can give them a call,

11:28.283 --> 11:30.050
somebody's
giving away a wheelchair.

11:30.584 --> 11:32.551
You know, your mom when she
walk around, her legs hurt,

11:32.717 --> 11:36.117
you know, so that chair
would be really nice for her.

11:37.618 --> 11:39.717
Okay.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.817
Welcome home.

11:44.717 --> 11:46.383
Good to meet you, Marvin.

11:46.518 --> 11:48.183
You too.

14:19.717 --> 14:21.817
Okay, so,
it looks worse than it is.

14:21.950 --> 14:23.384
She's really going to be okay.

14:23.518 --> 14:25.116
She's gonna need some help
when she gets home.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.817
You gotta make
sure she takes her meds.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.317
Hey.

14:51.484 --> 14:52.717
You got money?

14:52.817 --> 14:54.250
Yeah.

14:59.016 --> 15:00.584
What do you want?

15:01.817 --> 15:03.750
Let me get the xannie.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.216
Um, the, um, syringe?

15:08.351 --> 15:09.717
Hey.

15:09.817 --> 15:12.049
And the blue ones.

15:20.584 --> 15:22.317
You got any girl today?

15:22.949 --> 15:24.116
None of that.

15:24.251 --> 15:26.016
You gotta get that
somewhere else.

15:30.518 --> 15:34.317
Hey, uh, you know
who's getting out today?

15:38.484 --> 15:40.083
Fuck you talking about?

15:40.850 --> 15:44.251
Marvin fucking Hacks.
He got out today.

15:45.949 --> 15:47.916
I don't fucking care.

15:58.817 --> 15:59.949
Hush!

16:03.750 --> 16:05.183
Hush.

16:28.484 --> 16:30.150
Mom.

16:33.783 --> 16:35.618
Mom, let me do that.

16:37.217 --> 16:38.883
Okay.

17:06.049 --> 17:07.717
Marvin?

17:07.783 --> 17:09.217
Marvin!

17:10.518 --> 17:13.417
Hey, it's me, Father Browning.

17:13.551 --> 17:15.417
- Hey, Father.
- Hey. Come on.

17:16.184 --> 17:20.717
Uh, yeah.
It's so good to see you, yeah.

17:20.783 --> 17:24.049
I heard that
you were back in town.

17:24.184 --> 17:26.451
I mean, the whole town
heard you are back in town,

17:26.584 --> 17:29.217
but how are you doing, son?

17:29.351 --> 17:33.049
I don't know.
I'm okay, I guess.

17:33.949 --> 17:36.717
How's Bernadette?
Is she happy you're back?

17:36.783 --> 17:38.016
I'm not sure.

17:38.417 --> 17:43.284
Yeah. When you went away,
it was really hard for her.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.317
I spent a lot
of time with her, you know,

17:45.451 --> 17:47.117
up at the house, trying
to talk her through it.

17:47.251 --> 17:49.151
You know,
thanks, Father, thanks.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.618
"Thank you, Father, thanks."
Come on.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.417
Man, that's what I do.

17:53.551 --> 17:55.084
That's what I'm here for, right?

17:56.484 --> 18:00.016
Anyway, we're only here
for a fraction of a second.

18:00.151 --> 18:02.717
Not like we all matter
that much anyway,

18:02.849 --> 18:06.782
but I'm here,
and the church is here for you.

18:06.916 --> 18:11.417
If you need us, you know,
if it gets too hard.

18:11.551 --> 18:13.384
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

18:14.251 --> 18:15.484
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:15.618 --> 18:17.384
- Come on.
- Bye, guys.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.117
Take care.

18:25.883 --> 18:27.816
Hi, yeah I was...
I was calling to see

18:27.949 --> 18:30.284
if that wheelchair
was still available?

18:30.417 --> 18:33.983
Yeah. Go ahead.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.184
All right, when...
when is a good time?

18:42.317 --> 18:43.749
Now?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.384
Okay, thanks.

19:25.184 --> 19:26.417
Hey.

19:33.849 --> 19:35.251
What do you want?

19:35.384 --> 19:37.716
The wheelchair,
I'm here take a look at it.

19:40.151 --> 19:42.151
Unless you sold it already.

19:45.716 --> 19:47.417
No, you can see it.

19:57.716 --> 19:59.716
The left wheel is a bit wonky.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.782
Imma fix that.
How much you want for it?

20:14.084 --> 20:15.950
It's actually not for sale.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.351
Okay.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.017
Look, I have to go, so...

20:40.151 --> 20:43.451
Hey, I see you made
some new friends, huh?

20:45.151 --> 20:47.117
These two
assholes never liked me.

20:48.184 --> 20:50.682
The wheelchair
thing didn't work out.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.584
Damn. Uh, okay...

20:55.384 --> 20:57.716
Okay,
we'll just get another one, uh,

20:57.849 --> 20:59.451
for now,
just let her use the cane.

20:59.584 --> 21:02.584
Doctor wants her to
move around anyway, so, uh...

21:02.716 --> 21:05.551
cane should be...
should be fine.

21:06.317 --> 21:10.151
All right, well
I'ma go inside, get started.

21:10.782 --> 21:12.749
You enjoy these two all right?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.816
Okay, I'll see you.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.217
What do you mean he was here?

21:24.084 --> 21:26.251
Here, Russell, he was here.

21:29.816 --> 21:31.451
So, he's out?

21:31.583 --> 21:32.884
Yeah, obviously.

21:35.984 --> 21:38.749
Hey Ricky, get me a beer.

21:47.317 --> 21:49.884
Give me the fucking control.
Give me the fucking control.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.151
- I want to show you.
- Dude...

21:52.284 --> 21:54.351
Why was he here?

21:54.484 --> 21:56.217
Wanted to see the wheelchair.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.284
What did he say?

22:02.417 --> 22:04.117
Goddamn it Russell, nothing.
He didn't say anything.

22:04.251 --> 22:06.151
He wanted to see
the fucking wheelchair.

22:07.716 --> 22:09.351
He looked like a total asshole.

22:12.816 --> 22:15.184
Okay, and then what?

22:17.351 --> 22:19.117
Fucking talk!

22:19.251 --> 22:21.850
Hey Aidan?

22:21.984 --> 22:24.217
Uh, for fucks sake can
you please take that dog out,

22:24.351 --> 22:26.184
I'm tryna
have a conversation here.

22:27.817 --> 22:29.050
Then, nothing.

22:29.184 --> 22:31.117
I didn't give it
to him, obviously.

22:31.251 --> 22:33.583
Jesus Christ, man,
take that dog out.

22:36.517 --> 22:39.950
Ron said Martha's looking for
workers at fair trade. So...

22:40.084 --> 22:42.317
Did you want
to just fucking like, punch him?

22:42.451 --> 22:44.251
Fist fucking fuck him up?

22:44.984 --> 22:47.251
Yeah, you know... I don't know.

22:47.384 --> 22:50.517
"I don't know.
I don't know if I would've."

22:50.716 --> 22:51.984
He's a fucking pig.

22:52.117 --> 22:53.716
You know what? You should...
you should...

22:53.783 --> 22:55.017
you should've called me...

22:55.151 --> 22:56.483
'Cause I would've
fucking killed him,

22:56.617 --> 22:58.184
would've killed him right here.

22:58.317 --> 23:00.084
Yeah, I call my big brother
to kill a guy

23:00.217 --> 23:02.517
who killed our grandma 20 years
ago, that woulda helped.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.550
Shut the fuck up.
'Cause that's besides the point.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.617
Aidan! Keith!

23:08.749 --> 23:10.151
Take the fucking dog out!

23:10.284 --> 23:12.617
Delta took
him out a half hour ago.

23:13.050 --> 23:16.317
Don't drink in front of my boy.
You stink.

23:16.850 --> 23:18.984
And get these
fucking losers out.

23:19.117 --> 23:21.084
Who hangs out with his own
cousins this much?

23:21.217 --> 23:22.351
God.

23:44.984 --> 23:46.950
Thank you for dinner.

23:48.117 --> 23:49.884
Welcome.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.717
Are you going
to stand there all night?

24:10.117 --> 24:11.416
Sit.

24:19.817 --> 24:21.950
Remember how to play Slapjack?

24:22.284 --> 24:23.850
Of course I do.

24:31.550 --> 24:33.251
Get us a beer.

24:47.017 --> 24:48.984
Are you even supposed
to be smoking and drinking?

25:23.717 --> 25:26.950
Your uncle Teddy
died of lung cancer.

25:28.450 --> 25:30.017
Five years ago.

25:32.884 --> 25:35.583
Ruthie died two years later.

25:36.084 --> 25:39.416
Your cousin
Brian moved to Fresno.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.884
Uh, and Rosie died...

25:46.884 --> 25:48.750
12 years ago.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.383
My God, you don't even know.

25:55.450 --> 25:56.717
Things happen.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.817
You don't
even fucking know that.

26:10.117 --> 26:12.017
Treat you all right in there?

26:12.151 --> 26:14.383
I don't know.
I guess.

26:17.584 --> 26:19.283
It's a Queen.

26:22.917 --> 26:25.817
Prison's not supposed
to be fun anyway.

26:29.517 --> 26:30.950
Ow!

27:02.551 --> 27:04.217
You need help, mom?

27:05.717 --> 27:07.483
I've been shuffling
around this fucking house

27:07.618 --> 27:10.517
for the past 17 years by myself.

27:10.717 --> 27:11.783
I'm fine.

27:20.416 --> 27:23.884
Go, get my...
get my little oxy tank.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.283
You got any money, mom?

28:41.050 --> 28:42.484
- Huh?
- Cash. I need...

28:42.618 --> 28:44.416
I need to get food.

28:44.783 --> 28:46.451
Oh, okay.

28:50.551 --> 28:52.050
What happened?

28:52.884 --> 28:54.451
Someone threw a rock.

28:54.584 --> 28:56.350
Oh, God.

28:58.551 --> 29:00.817
We haven't had any
rock-throwing around here

29:00.950 --> 29:04.383
since the night police
came and took you away.

29:08.551 --> 29:11.183
They got your egg throwing.

29:11.984 --> 29:16.283
Somebody wrote "murderer"
on the garage door.

29:16.817 --> 29:18.817
That was attractive.

29:19.183 --> 29:21.316
Your uncle Teddy built the fence

29:21.451 --> 29:25.484
and got the dogs,
the party was over.

29:25.618 --> 29:27.384
Bring back some cigs.

29:28.417 --> 29:31.717
And, uh, some Twinkies.

29:31.850 --> 29:33.183
Twinkies?

29:33.316 --> 29:36.216
Yeah.
Let's have a celebration.

29:36.350 --> 29:38.050
You're here after all.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.783
It's the Hacks boy.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.750
Was that Bernadette's?

29:48.884 --> 29:50.817
- He got out.
- Fuck that guy.

29:50.950 --> 29:53.316
- He's really odd.
- Jesus Christ.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.683
Uh, just two. Just...

30:32.950 --> 30:34.584
Promised me a rubber ducky.

30:34.717 --> 30:36.917
Now, look, make sure you get all
the suds off this time, okay?

30:39.083 --> 30:41.283
Rubber ducky, you are too
grown to be having a rubber du...

30:41.417 --> 30:43.850
why do people have rubber
duckies in the bathtub anyway?

30:43.984 --> 30:46.417
It makes everything happy.

30:47.049 --> 30:48.884
Let me know
if you need anything.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.750
We're just fine.

31:03.451 --> 31:05.216
What was that in there?

31:06.518 --> 31:08.284
No, I don't know.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.183
What do you mean you don't know?

31:10.317 --> 31:11.518
That was...

31:11.717 --> 31:13.216
Look, he's trying, all right?

31:13.351 --> 31:15.384
You could see
he just want to help.

31:15.518 --> 31:16.950
Why are you so hard on him?

31:17.950 --> 31:20.016
What's that face, huh?

31:21.317 --> 31:23.950
Just doesn't
feel like my Marvin.

31:26.049 --> 31:28.049
He's not going
to be the same person.

31:28.183 --> 31:30.216
He was
locked up for 17 years.

31:30.351 --> 31:33.384
Plus he's a grown man now,
you got to see that.

31:35.216 --> 31:36.717
So you can act
like you don't care

31:36.783 --> 31:38.451
or you don't want to, you know.

31:38.584 --> 31:40.384
You... I don't care, you're just
making this face, whatever,

31:40.518 --> 31:42.150
he's-no, that's not true.

31:42.284 --> 31:44.317
Every time you've been asleep,
you would yell his name out.

31:46.949 --> 31:49.116
Hey, Marvin why don't
you come take a seat.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.551
Oh, man.

31:51.717 --> 31:53.884
Would you mind
helping me out a bit?

32:19.016 --> 32:21.217
I want you to do it.

32:27.551 --> 32:29.384
Hey, could you do me a fa...
could you...

32:29.518 --> 32:31.016
could you grab that for me?

32:31.150 --> 32:32.949
I forgot, 4:30 the van's
supposed to be picking her up.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.484
May... maybe that's the driver.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.150
It stopped.

32:58.384 --> 32:59.983
Jayden.

34:07.151 --> 34:08.883
Marvin?

34:09.016 --> 34:11.151
She's just finishing up
an infusion.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.117
May I have a word?

34:29.883 --> 34:32.384
Your mother
has stage 4 lung cancer.

34:33.284 --> 34:35.717
Unfortunately, she came
to us too late and the cancer

34:35.782 --> 34:37.451
has spread to her bones.

34:37.584 --> 34:41.151
One of the tumors is pressing
against her nerves,

34:41.284 --> 34:43.916
which is why
she's having difficulty walking.

34:44.717 --> 34:47.750
Considering the circumstances,
she's dealing with it well.

34:48.916 --> 34:51.151
Hopefully,
you'll stay out of trouble.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.584
People do change,
I believe that.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.717
How long?

34:58.916 --> 35:00.717
That's hard to say.

35:01.451 --> 35:04.749
A few weeks, one or two months,
maybe more, maybe less.

35:06.117 --> 35:08.050
Make sure she gets
a lot of rest and she gets up

35:08.184 --> 35:10.749
to move
around once or twice a day.

35:10.883 --> 35:12.317
We'll keep
the same pills as before

35:12.451 --> 35:14.717
but if the pain
gets worse, give me a call.

35:29.184 --> 35:31.351
Oh, you only live once, right?

35:37.916 --> 35:40.117
Take your dirty money.

36:00.251 --> 36:03.317
You're not letting me win
just because I'm dying, right?

36:06.117 --> 36:08.084
Don't say that again.

36:11.084 --> 36:15.284
Don't tell me
what I can say or not say.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.351
This is my house.

36:18.484 --> 36:19.849
If you don't like it,

36:19.984 --> 36:23.816
you can take off,
just like your old man.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.017
Wade?

37:09.749 --> 37:11.716
Wade.

37:31.749 --> 37:35.251
Fu-fuck yeah.

37:57.084 --> 38:01.317
We're fucking babies.
This... this is crazy.

38:02.251 --> 38:04.151
I'm practically
like a toddler here.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.351
I know.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.251
Look at these fucking stripe.

38:08.716 --> 38:10.984
That was almost 20 years ago.

38:17.816 --> 38:19.782
I was gone 17 years.

38:24.716 --> 38:26.417
Time's crazy.

38:26.550 --> 38:28.484
I remember
so much here from so long ago

38:28.617 --> 38:31.050
and I don't even remember
what I did yesterday.

38:36.084 --> 38:38.050
And your mom's still around?

38:39.950 --> 38:41.417
I haven't seen her in a while.

38:43.184 --> 38:45.151
She's kind of a cool lady.

38:50.884 --> 38:52.850
Tell her I said hi.

38:53.817 --> 38:55.782
She probably won't remember me.

38:57.517 --> 38:59.217
No, she remembers you.

39:09.050 --> 39:10.716
Well, you like pizza, huh?

39:10.850 --> 39:12.716
I mean fuck.

39:16.251 --> 39:19.484
Yeah, I work four times a week
at DoughMan's pizza.

39:19.617 --> 39:20.917
- DoughMan's?
- Yeah.

39:21.050 --> 39:23.017
That mu... that must be new.

39:23.151 --> 39:25.351
They kind of just-
I don't know, like,

39:25.483 --> 39:27.217
give me leftovers and shit.

39:32.151 --> 39:34.151
You want to see something?

39:36.117 --> 39:37.351
Sure.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.151
Are you ready?

39:53.284 --> 39:55.716
- Uh, yeah. I'm ready.
- Okay.

40:09.284 --> 40:11.550
- Holy shit.
- No.

40:17.084 --> 40:18.984
Woohoo!

40:19.950 --> 40:22.017
I've had contests
for this shit and stuff.

40:22.151 --> 40:25.417
I... I... I did 19 though,
19 seconds.

40:25.550 --> 40:28.084
Yeah. Nice.

40:29.084 --> 40:32.384
You've got to try.
You've got to try.

40:32.517 --> 40:33.917
Try, just try one.

40:35.682 --> 40:37.117
Like this?

40:37.251 --> 40:39.682
Yeah, no, no, no.
Start there.

40:48.950 --> 40:50.984
What else have you been up to?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.817
Like, the past 20
years or whatever?

40:58.850 --> 41:02.984
Like wife, babies or...

41:04.717 --> 41:09.050
I guess I've just been fucking
folding pizza boxes and shit.

41:14.917 --> 41:17.917
Last time
I saw you I was in court.

41:23.950 --> 41:27.184
- That's right.
- Yeah.

41:38.050 --> 41:41.383
But I can say thank you.
Just for the record.

41:42.151 --> 41:46.217
For what?
You didn't do anything.

41:46.350 --> 41:49.050
Maybe I didn't.
Maybe I should have.

41:52.617 --> 41:54.383
I just stood there,
like an idiot.

41:57.017 --> 42:00.550
Is that what you think?
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

42:02.416 --> 42:03.917
No.

42:09.184 --> 42:10.950
No.

42:14.017 --> 42:15.984
When you pushed her,
I just watched.

42:19.483 --> 42:21.884
When you punched
her fucking face...

42:23.783 --> 42:25.217
I watched.

42:29.416 --> 42:30.950
I did not stop you.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.950
She's lying there and there's
fucking blood everywhere.

42:48.350 --> 42:50.117
Why did you kill her?

43:08.350 --> 43:10.117
Fuck! Fuck!

43:13.117 --> 43:14.350
Shit.

43:18.717 --> 43:21.383
You can't do nothing.

43:22.783 --> 43:25.283
And you get that, right?

43:27.950 --> 43:30.084
What do you want to do?

43:33.783 --> 43:37.450
Ooh, ah!

43:37.584 --> 43:40.517
I want to let him
know he's not welcome here.

43:41.350 --> 43:43.283
I don't even
remember everything.

43:44.717 --> 43:46.850
I mean,
it was so long ago.

43:48.350 --> 43:51.917
I remember it.
I remember, all of it.

43:52.050 --> 43:54.717
I'll never forget it.

43:56.117 --> 43:59.551
I will never fucking forget

43:59.917 --> 44:03.917
how she looked
lying on that road.

44:20.518 --> 44:22.383
Marvin. Marvin.
Where are you going, man?

44:22.518 --> 44:24.316
Nothing. I'm just... I'm... I'm...

44:24.450 --> 44:26.717
Let's go
have a drink, okay?

44:28.416 --> 44:29.717
Okay?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:32.450 --> 44:34.518
Good music, good drinks.

44:34.717 --> 44:35.917
I'm telling you, it will be fun.

44:36.050 --> 44:38.817
All right.
Good to see you guys.

44:51.717 --> 44:53.850
Well, look at you, man.
You...

44:53.984 --> 44:55.917
You're a regular celebrity
around here.

44:57.383 --> 44:58.750
I'm joking.

44:59.216 --> 45:00.950
Nobody here
is over 21 years old,

45:01.084 --> 45:02.518
they don't know who you are.

45:03.484 --> 45:05.451
Now, do me a favor,
take a drink with me.

45:05.584 --> 45:07.017
I got...
I got you a vodka.

45:07.150 --> 45:08.817
I don't know if you've
had vodka for 17 years.

45:08.950 --> 45:10.917
I could get you
a Bailey's if...

45:14.250 --> 45:18.183
Wow. Brother, you're a truck.

45:23.750 --> 45:27.283
You know, uh,
you know I was married.

45:28.383 --> 45:29.584
When?

45:29.717 --> 45:31.050
That was three years ago.

45:31.183 --> 45:37.183
Uh, and we had a kid.
Yeah, I'm a dad.

45:37.717 --> 45:38.884
Where's the kid?

45:39.017 --> 45:40.884
Uh, she lives in Florida
with her mom.

45:41.017 --> 45:42.950
She got full custody, you know.

45:43.084 --> 45:46.850
Uh, her name is Nina.
Nina, like Simone.

45:48.518 --> 45:50.250
That must be tough.

45:51.116 --> 45:53.850
Yeah, it is.
You know, uh...

45:55.451 --> 45:57.150
I try not to think about it.

45:58.917 --> 46:01.050
And I miss her all the time.

46:19.850 --> 46:21.817
Hey.

46:23.484 --> 46:24.950
Hey.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.717
What was that?
The other day.

46:26.783 --> 46:28.316
The wheelchair.

46:29.384 --> 46:31.250
I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

46:31.384 --> 46:32.884
Really?

46:33.017 --> 46:35.216
I go all the way out to your
house to buy a wheelchair

46:35.350 --> 46:36.750
and you don't know
what I'm talking about?

46:36.884 --> 46:38.850
I changed my mind.

46:39.551 --> 46:41.316
Why?

46:43.017 --> 46:44.984
No, just say it. Why?

46:46.417 --> 46:48.783
Because I don't have anything
to give to people like you.

47:44.518 --> 47:46.283
There you are.

47:51.917 --> 47:53.384
You know,
the last time I saw you,

47:55.317 --> 47:59.750
my grandmother's blood was
splattered all over your shoes.

48:02.116 --> 48:04.917
You know, she was, uh,
a cute grandma, but she used

48:05.049 --> 48:07.717
to fucking beat the shit out
of me when I lived with her.

48:07.817 --> 48:09.016
She did, she took a fucking belt

48:09.150 --> 48:11.183
to the back of my...
back of my neck.

48:12.717 --> 48:16.183
I... I wanted to kick her in...
in the face myself.

48:20.717 --> 48:22.216
Sorry.

48:23.183 --> 48:25.850
I... I... I don't give
a shit about sorry, Marvin.

48:29.251 --> 48:31.284
Now, you ain't going to do it.
Are you just stand there

48:31.417 --> 48:34.717
like you got no mother-fucking
balls, is that it?

48:35.083 --> 48:36.717
Your older brother,
Karl, yeah,

48:36.817 --> 48:39.016
he was a fucking sissy,
a fucking coward.

48:40.551 --> 48:41.717
Really?

49:03.083 --> 49:04.717
Marvin.

50:41.284 --> 50:42.849
What happened?

50:43.983 --> 50:45.650
They got him.

50:47.849 --> 50:49.151
What?

50:49.717 --> 50:52.384
Oh man, this... this is crazy.

50:53.184 --> 50:55.151
Now, look at you,
you have a shotgun.

50:55.284 --> 50:56.949
They started it.

50:57.417 --> 50:58.783
They started it?

51:00.251 --> 51:01.983
Oh shit, man.

51:03.284 --> 51:04.551
Brother, you okay?

51:15.217 --> 51:16.750
Who did this?

51:17.384 --> 51:18.618
Fuentos.

51:19.782 --> 51:24.184
You know, I may be old, but
I know my way around a shotgun.

51:24.317 --> 51:25.883
Okay, look,
should we report this?

51:26.184 --> 51:28.717
Hell, no. We don't want
any police around here.

51:28.816 --> 51:31.184
And especially with
that shotgun.

51:31.317 --> 51:32.816
I'm on parole.

51:33.618 --> 51:35.849
I'm not even supposed
to have this in the house.

51:39.518 --> 51:41.084
Maybe you should take a walk.

51:41.217 --> 51:42.484
What?

51:42.618 --> 51:44.351
No.

51:46.284 --> 51:49.117
It's nice outside, Momma,
will you go for a walk with me?

51:49.251 --> 51:50.983
No.

51:58.883 --> 52:01.816
Your old high school
used to be there.

52:04.717 --> 52:08.849
You were a good soccer player,
we used to come every weekend.

52:08.983 --> 52:10.351
Remember that?

52:10.484 --> 52:11.749
Actually, I remember

52:11.883 --> 52:13.716
you were
actually pretty good at soccer.

52:13.782 --> 52:15.217
Yeah.

52:19.317 --> 52:20.716
Are you ready?

52:20.782 --> 52:22.117
I'm ready.

52:22.251 --> 52:24.084
Okay, go!

52:27.749 --> 52:28.916
Oh, I missed.

52:29.050 --> 52:31.117
Come on, let's see.

52:32.417 --> 52:34.351
There you go.

52:34.484 --> 52:35.849
Oh, now you getting fancy.

52:35.983 --> 52:39.618
I am, yeah.

52:39.749 --> 52:40.883
You got it.

52:44.983 --> 52:47.017
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, you can do it,

52:47.151 --> 52:48.716
- you can do it.
- You've made me do it.

52:58.518 --> 53:00.284
Oh, Christ.

53:01.151 --> 53:03.716
Hey!

53:05.251 --> 53:06.749
Hey, Bernadette.

53:09.417 --> 53:10.618
Hey.

53:10.749 --> 53:12.184
Hi.

53:13.716 --> 53:15.849
Are you okay, Marvin, huh?

53:15.984 --> 53:17.417
What the hell happened to you?

53:17.916 --> 53:20.417
Well, we just wrestled a little.

53:21.716 --> 53:23.384
Well, that's bullshit.

53:23.883 --> 53:25.017
I mean, who did that?

53:25.151 --> 53:26.816
Come on, Bernadette. Who did it?

53:28.849 --> 53:30.384
Oh good,
you are not going to tell me.

53:30.518 --> 53:33.584
Okay, fine.
I can't believe they did that.

53:33.716 --> 53:35.050
Fuck... fuck!

53:35.184 --> 53:37.716
I mean, why am I...
why am I talking about

53:37.782 --> 53:39.916
redemption and forgiveness.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.084
I talk every week
about that shit.

53:42.217 --> 53:44.384
- Fucking morons.
- It's all good, Father.

53:46.716 --> 53:49.883
You know what, I've known
you guys for a long time.

53:50.950 --> 53:54.284
I dried a lot
of Hacks family tears.

53:54.716 --> 53:56.716
Let it go, Bruce.

53:58.917 --> 54:00.816
What about you, Bernadette, huh?

54:01.716 --> 54:04.451
You didn't even open the door

54:04.584 --> 54:05.883
when I came by to check on you.

54:06.384 --> 54:08.984
And you don't even
come to church anymore, why?

54:13.584 --> 54:16.117
It was too much.

54:16.251 --> 54:17.484
Okay?

54:18.284 --> 54:20.484
Okay. That's...
that's fine... that's fine.

54:20.617 --> 54:22.317
It... it's just good

54:22.451 --> 54:24.583
that you got your boy back.

54:34.518 --> 54:36.117
Oh, God.

54:53.251 --> 54:54.884
Hey, Mrs. Hacks.

54:55.017 --> 54:56.716
How are you doing?

54:57.716 --> 54:59.417
Wade Lewis?

55:12.917 --> 55:14.884
You know,
I'll see you later dude.

55:53.217 --> 55:54.583
Fuck.

55:54.749 --> 55:56.617
Hey, are you good?

55:56.749 --> 55:58.251
Better.

55:59.749 --> 56:01.184
I don't know.

56:06.017 --> 56:08.117
Hey, that girl with
the green hair...

56:08.850 --> 56:10.483
with the green stripes.

56:10.617 --> 56:12.050
What's her deal?

56:13.384 --> 56:15.151
The Fuento girl?

56:16.351 --> 56:17.884
Fuento?

56:18.251 --> 56:19.984
Yeah.

56:20.117 --> 56:21.417
Delta,

56:21.550 --> 56:23.417
Russell Fuento's sister.

56:27.017 --> 56:29.716
Put that
in your pipe and smoke it.

56:34.351 --> 56:36.317
I mean,
I'm very messed up from here.

56:41.984 --> 56:44.550
What, are you like hot for her?

56:47.084 --> 56:48.716
She teaches
some kind of workout class

56:48.850 --> 56:50.517
at the community center.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.783
It's kind of for old people.

56:53.450 --> 56:54.984
My aunt used to go.

57:02.050 --> 57:04.984
Who was that band
we used to listen to here?

57:05.817 --> 57:08.217
Fuck the...

57:08.351 --> 57:09.850
the Donots.

57:10.617 --> 57:12.716
- Donots.
- Donots, yeah?

57:12.850 --> 57:15.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:15.217 --> 57:16.351
You saw that CD?

57:16.483 --> 57:17.750
CD?

57:17.884 --> 57:19.117
What are you
talking about, brother?

57:19.251 --> 57:21.717
We ain't got
fucking CD's no more.

57:22.550 --> 57:26.050
Fucking Bluetooth. Look.

58:26.817 --> 58:29.750
Great job today, guys.

58:29.884 --> 58:31.550
Drive safe.

58:31.717 --> 58:33.117
Hey,
can you guys give me a ride?

58:33.251 --> 58:34.817
Yeah, sure.

58:46.050 --> 58:48.317
Why did you cut me down
from the pole?

58:49.251 --> 58:50.383
That was you.

58:50.517 --> 58:51.750
What are you talking about?

58:52.117 --> 58:55.117
I know you were there.
I could smell you.

58:55.251 --> 58:58.717
What more do you want from me?
You already killed my grandma.

58:58.817 --> 59:00.184
And I'm sorry for that.

59:00.316 --> 59:02.950
- That's not enough.
- Well, what is enough?

59:03.084 --> 59:04.917
- Fuck off.
- No.

59:05.050 --> 59:06.984
- Just fuck off.
- No.

59:07.117 --> 59:09.383
Look, what the fuck
do you want from me?

59:09.517 --> 59:11.284
I want you to hit me.

59:13.117 --> 59:14.618
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- No, I mean it.

59:14.783 --> 59:16.117
I want you to hit me.
I deserve it.

59:16.251 --> 59:18.550
Last night wasn't enough.
Go ahead and hit me.

59:18.717 --> 59:20.217
I'm not gonna hit you.

59:22.050 --> 59:24.184
Your brother probably
does it all the time.

59:33.850 --> 59:36.917
Just get
the fuck away from me, please.

59:39.550 --> 59:41.316
Please just leave.

1:00:22.750 --> 1:00:24.884
Why the fuck
did you come back here?

1:00:25.017 --> 1:00:27.950
Cause this is my home,
and I have nowhere else to go.

1:00:28.084 --> 1:00:29.584
You're not welcome here.

1:00:29.717 --> 1:00:31.117
Well, guess what?

1:00:31.250 --> 1:00:33.216
- I know that.
- People like you don't-

1:00:33.350 --> 1:00:35.416
Yeah, people like me?
What about you?

1:00:35.551 --> 1:00:36.884
You little skank.

1:00:37.017 --> 1:00:38.584
You're stealing drugs
from the hospital?

1:00:38.717 --> 1:00:40.650
Slinging them to junkies?

1:00:40.783 --> 1:00:42.316
You're a real
good fucking person.

1:00:42.450 --> 1:00:44.151
Marvin!

1:00:44.283 --> 1:00:47.084
Oh shit, Mom! Mom.

1:00:48.917 --> 1:00:50.383
It's okay. Call an ambulance.

1:01:26.584 --> 1:01:28.050
Thank you.

1:01:33.717 --> 1:01:35.316
I have to go.

1:01:39.283 --> 1:01:41.050
Thanks for coming.

1:01:49.717 --> 1:01:52.183
You know, I was just a little
kid when my grandma died.

1:01:54.817 --> 1:01:57.316
A lot of it,
I didn't understand.

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:01.084
A lot of the...

1:02:01.216 --> 1:02:02.717
craziness, I-

1:02:03.717 --> 1:02:06.017
I don't remember it, but...

1:02:07.316 --> 1:02:08.750
I do remember her.

1:02:41.383 --> 1:02:42.618
Hey.

1:02:42.950 --> 1:02:45.316
- How's she doing?
- I don't know.

1:02:53.350 --> 1:02:55.316
What's it like
when your parents die?

1:03:03.618 --> 1:03:05.050
Um...

1:03:08.917 --> 1:03:11.717
I closed
my dad's eyes when he, um,

1:03:13.884 --> 1:03:16.817
when he
passed away five years ago.

1:03:18.451 --> 1:03:21.717
It was the hardest pain
I've ever experienced.

1:03:24.351 --> 1:03:26.984
I mean,
I've seen people die but...

1:03:29.518 --> 1:03:31.083
this time, it was my dad.

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:38.783
My dad was...

1:03:40.017 --> 1:03:42.518
my dad was a guy
everybody liked, right?

1:03:43.116 --> 1:03:46.917
Tall guy,
strong as a bull.

1:03:49.150 --> 1:03:51.150
He was
my high school football coach.

1:03:51.850 --> 1:03:53.717
Coach Johnson.

1:03:55.850 --> 1:03:57.717
Coach Johnson...

1:04:02.850 --> 1:04:05.317
I didn't think anything
or anybody...

1:04:07.717 --> 1:04:09.250
could destroy him...

1:04:11.717 --> 1:04:13.717
but cancer did.

1:04:20.783 --> 1:04:23.083
It all happened so fast,
you know.

1:04:24.717 --> 1:04:26.817
Within six months he was gone.

1:04:28.717 --> 1:04:30.351
Man, I cried...

1:04:32.116 --> 1:04:33.351
cried.

1:04:34.584 --> 1:04:36.384
I didn't
even wanna leave my bed.

1:04:42.216 --> 1:04:44.183
Guess I wasn't done loving him.

1:04:49.484 --> 1:04:52.717
Your mother is... asleep now.

1:04:53.216 --> 1:04:54.917
She's stable.

1:04:55.451 --> 1:04:57.183
Call in a few hours.

1:04:57.317 --> 1:04:58.484
Okay.

1:04:58.618 --> 1:05:00.049
Thank you.

1:05:00.917 --> 1:05:03.083
You fucking bitch!
Are you crazy?

1:05:03.216 --> 1:05:05.750
Would you like Mommy and Daddy
to know you're hanging

1:05:05.884 --> 1:05:07.384
with the guy
who killed our granny?

1:05:07.518 --> 1:05:09.216
I don't know where Mommy is
because she's with the...

1:05:09.351 --> 1:05:11.216
she's with
a fucking drug addict.

1:05:14.384 --> 1:05:15.750
And Daddy's in jail.

1:05:15.884 --> 1:05:17.484
That's fucking different.

1:05:17.618 --> 1:05:19.983
How is that different,
Russell?

1:05:21.618 --> 1:05:23.183
Fuck you.

1:05:52.717 --> 1:05:55.016
The junkyard
used to be over there.

1:05:56.183 --> 1:05:59.016
We used to come here
after we bailed on class.

1:05:59.150 --> 1:06:01.983
Yeah, and the barn was there
where those bleachers are.

1:06:02.116 --> 1:06:04.317
I used to bring
girls back there.

1:06:06.217 --> 1:06:07.717
Oh, yeah.

1:06:08.251 --> 1:06:09.484
Like who?

1:06:10.116 --> 1:06:11.584
Like Crystal Goodwin?

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:12.983
Oh, my God.

1:06:13.116 --> 1:06:14.949
I can't believe
you remember her.

1:06:15.083 --> 1:06:17.184
Holy shit.

1:06:17.317 --> 1:06:18.883
Oh, wow.

1:06:19.016 --> 1:06:21.184
Fucking Crystal, man.

1:06:21.717 --> 1:06:24.284
Her tits were so big.

1:06:28.016 --> 1:06:29.983
That's where
the barn was, right?

1:06:40.783 --> 1:06:42.750
All the way going down here.

1:07:27.750 --> 1:07:29.484
Remember when...

1:07:29.618 --> 1:07:32.717
You stole a pack of Menthols
from the 7-Eleven?

1:07:32.849 --> 1:07:34.717
Oh, yeah.

1:07:34.783 --> 1:07:36.916
And then
you couldn't find the lighter.

1:07:37.049 --> 1:07:40.151
So we had to go back
to steal the lighter.

1:07:45.518 --> 1:07:47.284
Too stupid to even smoke.

1:07:50.351 --> 1:07:51.983
Then we had to go
behind the barn,

1:07:52.117 --> 1:07:54.916
because we didn't
want anyone to see us.

1:07:57.816 --> 1:08:00.317
There was so many fucking flies.

1:08:01.451 --> 1:08:04.484
Karl just lying there
in his own blood,

1:08:04.618 --> 1:08:07.084
his eyes all glassy,

1:08:07.217 --> 1:08:09.883
the knife he cut his wrist with.

1:08:10.883 --> 1:08:13.016
God, the knife was so fucked up.

1:08:13.883 --> 1:08:15.849
So full of flies,

1:08:16.883 --> 1:08:18.551
and you just
screamed your head off

1:08:18.717 --> 1:08:21.551
and your mom comes running out
and they had to pin you down.

1:08:22.117 --> 1:08:24.251
God, that was fucking intense.

1:08:24.384 --> 1:08:26.816
- And then after...
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

1:08:38.384 --> 1:08:40.351
I don't fucking feel
anything anymore.

1:08:42.782 --> 1:08:44.417
Me neither.

1:08:46.151 --> 1:08:47.717
I don't feel a thing.

1:08:47.782 --> 1:08:49.217
See.

1:09:01.584 --> 1:09:04.716
How fucked up is a person
who doesn't feel any pain?

1:09:06.251 --> 1:09:07.883
Like a zombie.

1:09:15.849 --> 1:09:21.217
Here is another,
crackers with peanut butter.

1:09:21.351 --> 1:09:23.017
Oh, there it goes.

1:09:38.916 --> 1:09:40.084
What the fuck?

1:09:40.217 --> 1:09:42.816
I'd like
to speak to Delta, please.

1:09:49.284 --> 1:09:51.284
You motherfucker.
What are you doing on my street

1:09:51.417 --> 1:09:53.151
- at my sister's place?
- Hey! Russell.

1:09:53.284 --> 1:09:55.184
I thought we cleared
this up, motherfucker.

1:09:55.317 --> 1:09:57.217
- Get away from him.
- Didn't we not clear this up?

1:09:57.351 --> 1:09:59.716
This is none
of your business, Russell.

1:09:59.816 --> 1:10:01.451
Go inside
and make sure Benny gets

1:10:01.584 --> 1:10:02.950
some real food, for fuck's sake.

1:10:03.084 --> 1:10:05.384
Mandy will be here in a minute.

1:10:05.518 --> 1:10:07.417
Come on.

1:10:08.984 --> 1:10:10.716
Watching you.

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:14.050
Motherfucker.

1:10:14.184 --> 1:10:15.649
God, sometimes I feel like

1:10:15.782 --> 1:10:17.649
I'm the worst fucking mom
on the planet.

1:10:18.518 --> 1:10:21.284
My brother's
a total asshole, but he's...

1:10:21.417 --> 1:10:23.916
pretty good with Benny.

1:10:25.351 --> 1:10:26.649
What do you want?

1:10:26.782 --> 1:10:29.484
I need you to come with me. I...

1:10:29.617 --> 1:10:31.184
I need a witness.

1:10:31.317 --> 1:10:33.017
Please.

1:10:33.151 --> 1:10:35.184
I kinda have to be somewhere.

1:10:35.317 --> 1:10:37.084
Please.

1:10:37.451 --> 1:10:39.217
All right.

1:10:54.716 --> 1:10:56.883
What are we doing here?

1:10:59.451 --> 1:11:01.849
This is where I killed
your grandmother 17 years ago.

1:11:36.451 --> 1:11:38.849
I don't really know what to say.

1:11:40.550 --> 1:11:42.151
I gotta go.

1:11:45.950 --> 1:11:49.084
If you want to come by
my workout class, you... you can.

1:12:14.716 --> 1:12:15.984
Mom.

1:12:23.484 --> 1:12:27.317
Ah, there's my boyfriend.

1:12:29.451 --> 1:12:31.817
Bernadette, I can
tell you're feeling better.

1:12:31.950 --> 1:12:33.716
We'll keep you here
for a few more days

1:12:33.782 --> 1:12:35.084
and then send you home.

1:12:35.217 --> 1:12:36.716
It's okay, doc.

1:12:36.782 --> 1:12:39.251
I like you
better than him anyway.

1:12:46.716 --> 1:12:50.217
The fluid that built up in her
lung caused the infection.

1:12:51.017 --> 1:12:53.317
She's stable now, but...

1:12:54.716 --> 1:12:56.351
you have to prepare yourself.

1:12:59.617 --> 1:13:01.716
Try to enjoy the last days.

1:13:04.617 --> 1:13:06.384
Thank you, doctor.

1:13:46.617 --> 1:13:48.050
Hey.

1:13:48.817 --> 1:13:50.416
Hey.

1:13:53.084 --> 1:13:55.550
Is that the Hacks boy?

1:13:56.050 --> 1:13:57.984
Are you the Hacks boy?

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:03.717
Yes, ma'am, I am.

1:14:04.917 --> 1:14:06.384
I'm also almost 40 now.

1:14:06.517 --> 1:14:08.583
So I guess that makes me a man.

1:15:42.618 --> 1:15:44.151
Trust fall.

1:16:09.017 --> 1:16:11.117
I've never seen hair
like yours before.

1:16:11.251 --> 1:16:14.717
Is that real or, like,
there's little add-on things?

1:16:14.850 --> 1:16:16.817
It's real.

1:16:17.416 --> 1:16:18.950
I like it.

1:16:19.717 --> 1:16:21.717
I'm a hair stylist.

1:16:21.783 --> 1:16:24.017
I cut people's hair and stuff.

1:16:24.817 --> 1:16:26.717
So, wait...

1:16:27.717 --> 1:16:29.850
have you never
watched The Walking Dead?

1:16:32.618 --> 1:16:34.283
What about Game of Thrones?

1:16:34.783 --> 1:16:36.117
The Bachelor?

1:16:36.250 --> 1:16:37.618
No.

1:16:39.217 --> 1:16:40.618
Holy shit, dude.

1:16:40.750 --> 1:16:42.817
You missed out, big time.

1:16:48.817 --> 1:16:50.250
Hey would you...

1:16:52.316 --> 1:16:53.551
What?

1:16:53.984 --> 1:16:56.483
No, I was thinking
maybe you could...

1:16:56.618 --> 1:16:58.383
you could do my mom's hair.

1:17:55.850 --> 1:17:57.717
You want more coffee, Mom?

1:18:05.551 --> 1:18:08.450
You know I was thinking maybe
today, we could go to church.

1:18:08.584 --> 1:18:10.316
What do you think?

1:18:15.717 --> 1:18:18.084
After service,
we can go get brunch.

1:18:20.484 --> 1:18:21.917
Mom?

1:18:22.984 --> 1:18:25.183
What do you think,
going to get some brunch?

1:18:26.717 --> 1:18:28.717
Sounds good.

1:18:29.884 --> 1:18:31.750
I hope
you're not gonna wear that.

1:18:41.216 --> 1:18:42.350
Hey.

1:18:42.484 --> 1:18:43.618
Is this a good time?

1:18:43.750 --> 1:18:44.984
I was headed to pick up Benny

1:18:45.117 --> 1:18:46.717
and I thought
I could stop on the way.

1:18:47.383 --> 1:18:50.017
Er,
and I brought the wheelchair.

1:18:50.150 --> 1:18:52.783
Oh. Thank you. Wow. Yeah.

1:18:52.917 --> 1:18:55.084
No, thanks. Come on in. Yeah.

1:19:02.518 --> 1:19:06.183
Mom, this is Delta.

1:19:06.316 --> 1:19:07.783
Morning.

1:19:07.917 --> 1:19:09.850
She brought you a wheelchair...

1:19:10.551 --> 1:19:13.050
and she's gonna do your hair.

1:19:25.350 --> 1:19:27.083
- Music?
- Huh?

1:19:27.783 --> 1:19:29.717
Would you like music?

1:19:30.884 --> 1:19:33.817
Sure. What do you got?

1:19:34.384 --> 1:19:35.783
What do you like?

1:19:35.917 --> 1:19:38.116
I like country.

1:19:38.250 --> 1:19:39.451
Nice.

1:19:39.584 --> 1:19:40.717
Coming right up.

1:19:43.917 --> 1:19:45.850
Anti-gravity?

1:19:46.417 --> 1:19:50.350
Oh, yeah. It's for, um,
like, volume for your hair.

1:19:54.584 --> 1:19:56.150
Just sit forward.

1:19:56.283 --> 1:19:57.917
Thank you.

1:20:00.417 --> 1:20:02.049
You've got nice hair.

1:20:04.083 --> 1:20:05.950
You normally color it?

1:20:06.083 --> 1:20:10.250
Oh, er, I haven't in a while,
I probably should.

1:20:11.083 --> 1:20:14.116
I can only style today, but...

1:20:15.584 --> 1:20:17.417
We'll do it next time.

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:22.216
I think an up-do would be nice.

1:20:25.017 --> 1:20:26.884
Well, there you go.

1:20:27.017 --> 1:20:29.083
Yeah, great.

1:20:41.283 --> 1:20:42.618
You look great.

1:20:48.618 --> 1:20:50.650
I know who you are.

1:20:53.150 --> 1:20:55.717
You are the Fuento's
granddaughter.

1:20:56.618 --> 1:20:58.351
Heather and I were friends...

1:20:59.417 --> 1:21:00.850
before...

1:21:18.850 --> 1:21:20.817
It's all good, now.

1:21:31.451 --> 1:21:32.983
Wow!

1:21:33.116 --> 1:21:34.451
Mom...

1:21:34.584 --> 1:21:36.584
You look great.
She looks great.

1:21:36.717 --> 1:21:38.150
Right?

1:21:38.917 --> 1:21:42.317
Can I invite you to brunch,
after church?

1:21:43.417 --> 1:21:45.850
Please, let me.

1:21:47.351 --> 1:21:48.884
He's gonna be there.

1:21:50.551 --> 1:21:51.949
Sure.

1:21:52.384 --> 1:21:53.817
Yeah.

1:22:01.049 --> 1:22:02.251
I think it's fitting today

1:22:02.384 --> 1:22:05.817
that we read
from the book of Matthew.

1:22:06.451 --> 1:22:12.384
Matthew teaches us
the following about forgiveness.

1:22:13.116 --> 1:22:17.717
"For
if you forgive other people"

1:22:17.783 --> 1:22:19.750
When they sin against us-.

1:22:19.884 --> 1:22:21.518
Who did that?

1:22:21.717 --> 1:22:22.783
Who fucking did that?

1:22:22.916 --> 1:22:24.783
Don't swear in church.

1:22:24.916 --> 1:22:26.983
If somebody attacks
my son in church,

1:22:27.116 --> 1:22:28.717
I start swearing in church...

1:22:28.817 --> 1:22:30.551
No, no, stop.
Are you serious, people?

1:22:30.717 --> 1:22:32.317
He's a killer. He should leave.

1:22:32.451 --> 1:22:34.551
- Why is he still here?
- No, he's not welcome.

1:22:34.717 --> 1:22:37.150
Fuck that bitch.

1:22:38.949 --> 1:22:40.717
Do you want this killer here?

1:22:40.783 --> 1:22:42.116
No.

1:22:42.251 --> 1:22:44.217
Do you want
this piece of shit to leave?

1:22:44.351 --> 1:22:45.484
He's a killer.

1:22:45.618 --> 1:22:47.150
He's a killer.

1:22:47.284 --> 1:22:51.451
Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer.

1:22:51.584 --> 1:22:53.217
Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer.

1:22:53.351 --> 1:22:57.083
Stop! Stop it.
What's wrong with you people?

1:22:57.217 --> 1:23:00.184
- He's the fucking problem!
- Jesus Christ!

1:23:00.317 --> 1:23:02.983
We haven't even
started mass yet.

1:23:03.116 --> 1:23:04.883
Animals.
That's right, you heard me.

1:23:05.016 --> 1:23:06.251
That's what you are.

1:23:06.384 --> 1:23:07.916
That's what
you fucking are, animals.

1:23:08.049 --> 1:23:09.384
He's an animal.

1:23:09.518 --> 1:23:11.016
Listen to this.

1:23:11.717 --> 1:23:13.417
Listen to this.

1:23:13.551 --> 1:23:17.217
"It is a sin not to forgive,

1:23:17.351 --> 1:23:19.016
Matthew 6:14,"

1:23:19.150 --> 1:23:23.584
because unforgiveness
can leave you unforgiven.

1:23:23.717 --> 1:23:26.151
He is not
welcome in our community.

1:23:26.284 --> 1:23:27.518
That's right.

1:23:29.817 --> 1:23:31.284
Guess what?

1:23:33.518 --> 1:23:35.184
If you can't find

1:23:35.317 --> 1:23:38.717
humanity and forgiveness
in your heart today,

1:23:39.717 --> 1:23:43.551
then I ask you, and everyone

1:23:43.717 --> 1:23:46.251
who feels that way...

1:23:46.384 --> 1:23:47.983
to leave.

1:23:48.116 --> 1:23:50.116
- Right now.
- Is he serious?

1:23:50.251 --> 1:23:54.584
All assholes
can leave this church right now.

1:23:54.717 --> 1:23:56.816
You know what, Father,
fuck this shit.

1:23:56.949 --> 1:23:58.417
Then get out.

1:23:58.551 --> 1:24:00.417
All right, we're gone.

1:24:00.551 --> 1:24:03.417
Are you saying I should
go back to where I came from?

1:24:05.518 --> 1:24:07.083
That's what I did.

1:24:07.750 --> 1:24:09.783
I came home.

1:24:13.484 --> 1:24:15.816
My mom is not doing too good.

1:24:15.949 --> 1:24:18.783
So I'm staying
to take care of her.

1:24:20.417 --> 1:24:23.217
It's the right
thing to do, you know. And...

1:24:24.883 --> 1:24:27.084
I want to do what's right.

1:24:30.750 --> 1:24:33.451
It's important to me that
I can look my mom in the eyes

1:24:33.584 --> 1:24:35.782
and see that she
doesn't hate me.

1:24:37.949 --> 1:24:40.717
Family, home.

1:24:42.317 --> 1:24:43.883
That's everything.

1:24:46.983 --> 1:24:49.717
When you mess up,

1:24:49.816 --> 1:24:53.084
people don't want to believe
that you regret what you did.

1:24:54.717 --> 1:24:56.084
They don't want to...

1:24:56.217 --> 1:24:58.049
they don't want to hear
you say that you're sorry

1:24:58.184 --> 1:25:00.717
and that you wish you could
go back in time and change it.

1:25:03.717 --> 1:25:05.284
But I do.

1:25:07.084 --> 1:25:09.384
I do, I wish I could change it.

1:25:18.417 --> 1:25:20.317
Okay...

1:25:26.749 --> 1:25:28.184
Son...

1:25:31.849 --> 1:25:34.050
These are your people.

1:25:34.184 --> 1:25:36.782
All these people
that stayed here,

1:25:36.916 --> 1:25:38.816
they stayed for a reason.

1:25:40.217 --> 1:25:44.916
And I ask you,
as the community that you are...

1:25:46.084 --> 1:25:50.284
to support Marvin
and his mother, Bernadette.

1:25:52.618 --> 1:25:54.184
And...

1:25:54.916 --> 1:25:57.050
that's it for today.

1:25:58.782 --> 1:26:01.050
That's all I had.

1:26:02.351 --> 1:26:05.749
It's hot,
I'm going to take this off.

1:26:10.551 --> 1:26:13.317
Thank you, people.

1:26:14.849 --> 1:26:16.816
Thank you.

1:26:31.351 --> 1:26:33.716
So, how was church?

1:26:33.782 --> 1:26:35.584
It was...

1:26:35.716 --> 1:26:37.184
interesting.

1:26:37.317 --> 1:26:39.984
I definitely had some
old farts checking me out.

1:26:40.117 --> 1:26:43.217
You guys look a bit holier.

1:26:44.384 --> 1:26:45.716
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1:26:45.782 --> 1:26:47.950
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1:26:48.084 --> 1:26:49.716
Have some of my pig.

1:26:49.849 --> 1:26:51.782
Oh, yeah.

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.916
- Some.
- Oh, you... you want this one?

1:26:54.050 --> 1:26:56.451
- No.
- All right. Thank you.

1:26:56.584 --> 1:26:58.384
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

1:27:03.749 --> 1:27:05.417
She likes you.

1:27:12.251 --> 1:27:15.151
Promise me
you'll take care of yourself.

1:27:16.917 --> 1:27:18.716
I promise.

1:27:22.584 --> 1:27:25.217
Can you use that to take
a picture of my mom and I?

1:27:25.716 --> 1:27:27.151
Yeah.

1:27:27.484 --> 1:27:28.917
Come here, Mom.

1:27:32.917 --> 1:27:35.716
Oh, it's on selfie mode.

1:27:36.716 --> 1:27:38.782
Okay. Ready?

1:27:41.617 --> 1:27:43.050
Cute.

1:27:44.117 --> 1:27:45.417
So fast.

1:27:45.551 --> 1:27:47.151
Look at that.

1:28:19.917 --> 1:28:21.884
Today was a good day.

1:28:22.384 --> 1:28:23.884
Yeah.

1:28:24.749 --> 1:28:26.749
Very good.

1:28:29.917 --> 1:28:31.816
How are you doing?

1:28:35.384 --> 1:28:36.917
I'm okay.

1:28:38.484 --> 1:28:39.917
How are you doing?

1:28:45.451 --> 1:28:46.884
I don't know.

1:28:49.151 --> 1:28:51.984
The past weeks have been...

1:28:52.117 --> 1:28:53.782
a lot.

1:28:57.084 --> 1:28:58.917
A lot
of good things too, though.

1:30:14.984 --> 1:30:16.682
Amen.

1:31:16.583 --> 1:31:19.084
I think I'm going
to quit smoking tomorrow.

1:31:19.583 --> 1:31:21.950
Good. It's a good decision.

1:31:23.717 --> 1:31:25.050
Making a new day.
