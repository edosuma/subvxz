11:29.194 --> 11:31.762
Enough. Let's go.

11:31.764 --> 11:34.665
- I have places to be.
- Sorry, Soren.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.734
Don't listen to Atticus.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.701
His dad doesn't even pay taxes.

11:38.703 --> 11:40.604
Doesn't matter
what Atticus says.

11:40.606 --> 11:42.138
I've been thinking about
quitting singing

11:42.140 --> 11:43.806
ever since I was young.

11:43.808 --> 11:46.944
Come on.
We're gonna miss fish sticks.

11:57.155 --> 12:00.957
Whoa. That's the best lunch
I've ever seen.

12:00.959 --> 12:03.761
Yeah, my parents are being
super nice because...

12:03.763 --> 12:05.963
because...

12:05.965 --> 12:07.697
they're great and...

12:07.699 --> 12:10.002
they're great,
and ev-everything's good.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.038
Ooh, wait.
Is that a new earring?

12:15.040 --> 12:17.774
Yes, finally.
Thank you for noticing.

12:17.776 --> 12:19.877
- It looks cute on you.
- Max, I'm not going for cute.

12:19.879 --> 12:21.711
I'm going for sexy and hot.

12:21.713 --> 12:24.047
Those are the only two things
I'm looking for.

12:24.049 --> 12:25.248
You like it?

12:25.250 --> 12:27.685
It looks infected.

12:30.323 --> 12:32.656
Soren's so cool.

12:32.658 --> 12:34.023
I heard he beat up
Derek Bachman

12:34.025 --> 12:35.091
and blow-jobbed his sister.

12:35.093 --> 12:37.261
He blow-jobbed his own sister?

12:37.263 --> 12:39.296
No, he blow-jobbed
Derek's sister.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.535
Fucking legend.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.075
I think Soren's calling me.

12:52.077 --> 12:56.279
♪ Uh, how we get down ♪

12:56.281 --> 12:58.748
♪ Putting it down,
now you know ♪

12:58.750 --> 13:01.317
♪ If you didn't know,
then I bet you know now, uh. ♪

13:01.319 --> 13:04.187
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

13:04.189 --> 13:07.123
I heard you sipped a beer
like a fucking champ.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.058
Yeah, I took a pretty big sip,
actually.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.226
Cool.

13:10.228 --> 13:12.028
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

13:12.030 --> 13:13.699
All these fools are coming.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.300
You in?

13:16.302 --> 13:17.801
You should come.

13:17.803 --> 13:19.003
Trust me.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.903
Yeah, I'll come,

13:20.905 --> 13:23.275
but, you know,
I'll have to ask my mom.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.777
Also, gonna be a kissing party.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.051
You've French-kissed
girls before, right?

13:35.053 --> 13:36.753
Yeah.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.254
Of course.

13:38.256 --> 13:39.758
Where?

13:43.828 --> 13:45.095
Their mouths?

13:45.097 --> 13:47.797
Yeah, dawg.

13:47.799 --> 13:49.932
He's not gonna start sitting

13:49.934 --> 13:52.036
with the popular kids, is he?

13:52.038 --> 13:54.808
No. If anyone should be
over there, it's me.

13:56.174 --> 13:58.042
We heard kids were
calling you Sippy Cup,

13:58.044 --> 14:01.011
and we just wanted to let you
know you can always call on

14:01.013 --> 14:03.180
the Student Coalition Against
Bullying for protection.

14:03.182 --> 14:05.148
Does this look like
a sippy cup?

14:05.150 --> 14:07.984
No, it's a fucking juice box.

14:07.986 --> 14:10.387
'Cause I'm not a fucking child.

14:10.389 --> 14:11.888
That's so rude.

14:11.890 --> 14:14.858
Wait. Can I bring
Thor and Lucas?

14:17.896 --> 14:19.028
So random.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.730
No, they're cool.

14:20.732 --> 14:22.432
I'm trying to keep it
half girls, half guys.

14:22.434 --> 14:23.801
You feel me, dawg?

14:23.803 --> 14:25.768
I feel you, dawg, but...

14:25.770 --> 14:27.271
they're my best friends.

14:27.273 --> 14:29.709
We do everything together.
We're the Bean Bag Boys.

14:30.742 --> 14:32.042
That's a dope-ass name.

14:32.044 --> 14:34.845
Fuck it. Bring 'em.

14:34.847 --> 14:36.846
I ride or die
for my squad, too.

14:36.848 --> 14:38.949
Let me know
what your mom says, dawg.

14:38.951 --> 14:41.053
Okay. Bye, dawg.
Bye, dawgs.

14:43.054 --> 14:44.988
So?

14:44.990 --> 14:46.989
Soren just invited us
to his party tomorrow.

14:46.991 --> 14:48.859
- Soren?
- Yeah.

14:48.861 --> 14:51.128
He said my name?
He said "Thor"?

14:51.130 --> 14:53.763
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Sweet.

14:53.765 --> 14:55.032
Oh, there's also
gonna be girls there.

14:55.034 --> 14:56.399
You know what that means?

14:56.401 --> 14:58.268
Drama.

14:58.270 --> 14:59.268
Kissing.

15:03.007 --> 15:06.075
So, do you guys know
how to kiss?

15:06.077 --> 15:07.945
- I have no fucking clue.
- No.

15:07.947 --> 15:09.816
No, not at all.

15:10.816 --> 15:12.816
<i>Type "kissing."</i>

15:12.818 --> 15:14.920
Ooh. No, no, no. "Boobs."

15:15.954 --> 15:18.154
"Breast cancer research."

15:18.156 --> 15:20.490
"How to find a bra that fits."

15:20.492 --> 15:22.428
I have an idea.

15:31.035 --> 15:32.369
"Are you 18 or older?"

15:32.371 --> 15:34.003
I'm gonna click "yes."

15:34.005 --> 15:35.404
We're not 18 or older.

15:35.406 --> 15:37.807
This could go on
our permanent record.

15:39.077 --> 15:41.277
I'm your stepmother.
You are not supposed to be

15:41.279 --> 15:43.346
- looking at me in the shower.
- Don't tell my dad.

15:43.348 --> 15:44.882
He'll make me quit
the sports team.

15:44.884 --> 15:46.783
Get up. Get up.

15:46.785 --> 15:48.284
He's in trouble.

15:48.286 --> 15:50.253
You deserve a punishment.

15:50.255 --> 15:51.421
Pull down your shorts.

15:51.423 --> 15:52.855
Is that what happens

15:52.857 --> 15:54.490
when you get a stepmom?

15:54.492 --> 15:57.226
Ew.

15:57.228 --> 15:59.329
No way that's gonna fit
in there.

15:59.331 --> 16:00.531
Get out of there, girl!

16:00.533 --> 16:02.199
Where did his hand go?

16:02.201 --> 16:03.267
- Ew!
- Oh, my God!

16:07.505 --> 16:09.138
Nobody even kissed.

16:09.140 --> 16:12.242
Yeah, not on their mouths
at least.

16:12.244 --> 16:14.378
My parents have a CPR doll.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.180
We can go practice kissing
on that.

16:16.182 --> 16:18.181
Come on.

16:23.923 --> 16:27.327
This is
a really pretty CPR doll.

16:28.526 --> 16:31.195
I guess I'll go first.

16:34.132 --> 16:35.431
Stop.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.200
What are you doing?

16:37.202 --> 16:38.534
Kissing her.

16:38.536 --> 16:40.571
You can't kiss someone
without their permission.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.538
Remember from assembly?

16:42.540 --> 16:43.941
Pretend it's Brixlee.

16:43.943 --> 16:46.008
- Try to be a gentleman.
- Okay.

16:46.010 --> 16:48.244
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

16:48.246 --> 16:49.946
Why?

16:49.948 --> 16:51.915
- Why?
- Yeah.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.550
What do you like about me?

16:53.552 --> 16:55.319
Well...

16:55.321 --> 16:57.988
you're sweet.
You smell good.

16:57.990 --> 16:59.422
You're smart, too.

16:59.424 --> 17:01.023
You always push Henry
in his wheelchair

17:01.025 --> 17:02.558
even though he's super mean.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.127
And just when I think
I've got you figured out,

17:05.130 --> 17:07.030
you go ahead
and start skateboarding.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.965
I consent.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.509
- How was it?
- Sticky.

17:21.913 --> 17:24.414
Why does she have hair
in her mouth?

17:24.415 --> 17:26.983
You know what? This isn't
teaching us anything.

17:26.986 --> 17:28.483
We need to see
real people kissing.

17:28.486 --> 17:30.987
That's the only way to know
if we're doing it right.

17:30.989 --> 17:33.223
My neighbor is
a total nymphomaniac.

17:33.225 --> 17:35.192
Her boyfriend's always over.

17:35.194 --> 17:36.926
She starts fires?

17:36.928 --> 17:40.296
No, that's a pyromaniac.
She's a nymphomaniac.

17:40.298 --> 17:43.032
Someone who has sex
on land and sea.

17:43.034 --> 17:45.636
Seriously?

17:45.638 --> 17:48.071
Okay, I was gonna wait
till tomorrow to surprise you,

17:48.073 --> 17:49.438
but can I just tell you?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.341
- Nah, I'm good.
- No, you want to know.

17:52.343 --> 17:54.311
Ugh. I can barely see anything.

17:54.313 --> 17:56.013
I know we haven't been
hanging out much,

17:56.015 --> 17:57.347
you know,
ever since I met Benji,

17:57.349 --> 17:58.916
but I want to
make it up to you.

17:58.918 --> 18:00.051
So, tomorrow,
I'm skipping school,

18:00.053 --> 18:02.452
and we're driving to the city
to see Kendrick Lamar.

18:02.454 --> 18:04.454
- Shut up!
- And we're gonna do Molly.

18:04.456 --> 18:06.255
- You thought of everything.
- Of course I fucking have.

18:06.257 --> 18:08.024
It's gonna be amazing.

18:08.026 --> 18:09.959
Remix!

18:11.362 --> 18:13.930
Well, Benji got us the Molly.

18:13.932 --> 18:16.699
- Benjamin.
- Oh, thank you!

18:16.701 --> 18:17.801
Look.

18:17.803 --> 18:21.504
This isn't working.
Maybe we could go climb a tree.

18:21.506 --> 18:23.340
No, they'd see us.

18:23.342 --> 18:25.108
No, I just meant
let's go climb a tree.

18:25.110 --> 18:26.176
Dude, wait.

18:26.178 --> 18:29.378
I know a way
we can see them kiss.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.155
I can't.

18:38.157 --> 18:40.724
It has a camera.
We could see everything.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.993
We can learn technique.

18:42.995 --> 18:44.994
It's for his dad's work.
It's not a toy.

18:44.996 --> 18:47.965
Of course it's a toy.
They sell it at toy stores.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.966
My uncle flew a drone
for the Army,

18:49.968 --> 18:52.969
and now he yells in his sleep
and has crazy diarrhea.

18:52.971 --> 18:55.205
It's messed up that he even
keeps it in the house.

18:55.207 --> 18:57.374
You have to walk by it
every day.

18:57.376 --> 18:58.708
- He's torturing you.
- It's true.

18:58.710 --> 19:01.011
It's like when your cousin
walks around in a bikini

19:01.013 --> 19:02.378
and she taunts you.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.113
If he finds out,
you'll be grounded.

19:04.115 --> 19:06.015
You won't be able
to go to Soren's.

19:06.017 --> 19:08.452
And even worse, you'll lose
your father's trust.

19:08.454 --> 19:10.186
It's true, too.

19:10.188 --> 19:12.089
She'll love you
for who you are.

19:12.091 --> 19:14.724
Yeah, a shitty kisser.
Remember the porn from earlier?

19:14.726 --> 19:16.292
That guy didn't even know
how to kiss.

19:16.294 --> 19:17.627
He was just licking
that woman's asshole.

19:17.629 --> 19:20.363
- You want to kiss an asshole, Max?
- No.

19:20.365 --> 19:22.331
Max, don't listen to him.
He just wants to go

19:22.333 --> 19:24.734
because he's obsessed
with popular boys.

19:24.736 --> 19:27.137
Believe me, Max.
You don't want to go to Soren's

19:27.139 --> 19:29.539
not knowing how to kiss.

19:34.446 --> 19:36.780
So, tomorrow,
after you get some girl time,

19:36.782 --> 19:39.483
why don't you come over
for some man time?

19:39.485 --> 19:41.784
No, I told you I'm hanging out
with Lily this weekend.

19:41.786 --> 19:43.653
Yeah, it's just...
you know, it's hard

19:43.655 --> 19:46.455
for me not to see you,
'cause you're my best friend.

19:46.457 --> 19:48.792
- But Lily's my best friend.
- Yeah, I get it.

19:48.794 --> 19:50.226
Totally, totally get it.

19:50.228 --> 19:52.428
Yeah.

19:52.430 --> 19:55.331
I'll probably just hang out
with my ex, Margaret.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.333
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

19:57.335 --> 19:59.535
Uh, no.
Why? Are you jealous?

20:01.372 --> 20:03.473
Yeah, this isn't working out.

20:03.475 --> 20:05.742
I know. You're not hot enough
to be acting like this,

20:05.744 --> 20:07.476
so the next time
that you're wondering

20:07.478 --> 20:09.646
where all the nice guys went,
just remember

20:09.648 --> 20:12.051
that you let one walk
right out the door.

20:14.686 --> 20:16.552
What?

20:16.554 --> 20:18.054
I didn't say anything.

20:18.056 --> 20:19.558
I never want to see you again.

20:22.828 --> 20:24.464
Are you okay?

20:27.466 --> 20:28.799
Wait, where'd the guy go?

20:28.801 --> 20:31.100
Who cares?
The girls just hugged.

20:31.102 --> 20:33.102
They are definitely gonna kiss.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.404
We might need to get closer.

20:34.406 --> 20:37.073
Do you hear that?

20:37.075 --> 20:39.408
What is that?

20:39.410 --> 20:41.177
It's fucking spying on us.

20:41.179 --> 20:43.647
- All right, it's my turn to fly.
- Give it!

20:43.649 --> 20:45.251
- I just want to buzz 'em.
- No!

20:46.251 --> 20:47.818
Hey, you're gonna break it.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.253
You want it? Fine!

20:50.255 --> 20:51.253
Shit!

20:55.561 --> 20:56.859
Ha!

20:56.861 --> 20:58.861
No!

20:58.863 --> 21:02.365
- Shit! What the hell, Thor?
- That was both of our faults.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.137
Well, Dad's gonna kill me.
What do I do now?

21:06.604 --> 21:07.771
- Whoa!
- What the hell?!

21:07.773 --> 21:09.238
- We say there was a break-in.
- What...?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.241
They trashed the place
and took the drone.

21:11.243 --> 21:13.642
That's the most stupid
fucking idea I've ever heard!

21:13.644 --> 21:15.311
Guys, guys.

21:15.313 --> 21:17.214
All we have to do
is just go over there

21:17.216 --> 21:19.349
and tell the truth,
then God will be on our side.

21:25.290 --> 21:28.224
Hey. Can I help you?

21:28.226 --> 21:29.725
Uh, I hope so, madam.

21:29.727 --> 21:32.462
We were using our drone
to follow a family of turtles,

21:32.464 --> 21:34.531
and we thought it might have
crashed in your backyard.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.302
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here.
Come on in.

21:42.341 --> 21:44.474
- So, you guys like turtles?
- Yeah.

21:44.476 --> 21:47.276
- That's awesome.
- Time's up, motherfuckers.

21:47.278 --> 21:48.512
Shit! It's a trap.

21:48.514 --> 21:50.546
You think I give a fuck
about turtles?

21:50.548 --> 21:52.682
We're sorry. We just wanted
to learn how to kiss.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.251
Lucas, it's none
of their business.

21:54.253 --> 21:55.752
We should have just
told the truth.

21:55.754 --> 21:57.521
We're going to a kissing party,

21:57.523 --> 21:59.622
and none of us have
ever kissed, and we're scared.

21:59.624 --> 22:01.291
Goddamn it, Lucas.

22:01.293 --> 22:04.761
I've had sex before,
but I've never kissed a girl.

22:04.763 --> 22:07.429
Just go online and type in
"how to kiss."

22:07.431 --> 22:08.732
That's what everyone does.

22:08.734 --> 22:11.201
Oh.

22:11.203 --> 22:12.903
It's very easy.

22:12.905 --> 22:14.704
Look, can we please
have the drone back?

22:14.706 --> 22:16.372
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.
It's my dad's.

22:16.374 --> 22:18.507
He needs it for work.
Can I please have it back?

22:18.509 --> 22:20.443
- I really need it. Please.
- I don't think so.

22:20.445 --> 22:23.446
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.

22:23.448 --> 22:25.447
And I'll tell him
that you're a pervert.

22:25.449 --> 22:26.483
We'll tell the whole school.

22:26.485 --> 22:28.484
This is sensual harassment.

22:28.486 --> 22:30.520
We'll tell everyone
that you're a misogynist.

22:30.522 --> 22:33.490
I never massaged anyone.

22:33.492 --> 22:36.525
This is what happens
when you don't respect women.

22:36.527 --> 22:38.962
I respect women.
My mom's my best friend.

22:38.964 --> 22:40.830
What about me?

22:40.832 --> 22:43.500
Oh, God, I'm so fucked.

22:43.502 --> 22:45.368
My dad's gonna kill me.

22:45.370 --> 22:48.237
You had to snoop on them.
You're such a feminist.

22:48.239 --> 22:50.840
I'm-I'm not a feminist.
I love women.

22:50.842 --> 22:53.243
And my parents are definitely
gonna call your guys' parents.

22:53.245 --> 22:54.644
We're all gonna get grounded.

22:54.646 --> 22:56.446
Forget Soren's party.
We're fucked.

22:56.448 --> 22:59.416
Why are you smiling?
This is actually your fault.

22:59.418 --> 23:01.786
This is leverage.

23:06.225 --> 23:07.523
Oh.

23:07.525 --> 23:09.326
Bingo.

23:09.328 --> 23:11.594
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

23:11.596 --> 23:12.928
That's a tampon.

23:12.930 --> 23:14.965
- What's it for?
- Girls shove it

23:14.967 --> 23:16.933
up their buttholes
to stop babies from coming out.

23:16.935 --> 23:18.601
An eighth-grader told me that.

23:18.603 --> 23:21.606
The human body
is truly a mystery.

23:23.007 --> 23:24.742
Can't believe
they still eat chewables.

23:25.774 --> 23:26.542
The gummies are so much better.

23:26.544 --> 23:28.878
I like the chewables.
I want one.

23:41.426 --> 23:43.260
Fucking childproof bullshit!

23:43.262 --> 23:45.861
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

23:54.305 --> 23:55.437
It's the girls.

23:56.641 --> 23:58.274
Hello?

23:58.276 --> 24:01.378
You took my bag.
It has my license, my phone.

24:01.380 --> 24:02.745
Bring it back right now.

24:02.747 --> 24:04.880
Fuck that noise.
I want my drone back.

24:04.882 --> 24:07.384
I got this.
I got this, I got this.

24:07.386 --> 24:09.452
What did you
just say, you little bitch?

24:09.454 --> 24:12.355
I'll take a shit
down your throat.

24:12.357 --> 24:14.523
Why are you talking like that?

24:14.525 --> 24:16.025
Hannah, I have
a little brother.

24:16.027 --> 24:18.895
- You're supposed to scare them.
- Well, you scared me.

24:18.897 --> 24:21.497
Listen, we-we were just trying
to teach you a lesson.

24:21.499 --> 24:24.067
I promise you we were gonna
give the drone back.

24:24.069 --> 24:26.035
No way.
They could trick us again.

24:26.037 --> 24:27.904
Or overpower us.

24:27.906 --> 24:30.740
Oh, my God.
What if they take the Molly?

24:30.742 --> 24:33.342
Then we wouldn't be able
to take it.

24:33.344 --> 24:34.644
No, they're children.
They would die.

24:36.848 --> 24:38.580
This is Max from earlier.

24:38.582 --> 24:41.051
Meet us at the playground
across from John Adams

24:41.053 --> 24:43.552
tomorrow at 7:40 a.m.

24:43.554 --> 24:46.926
Bring the drone, and don't
fuck with the Bean Bag Boys.

24:48.326 --> 24:50.560
- That was tough.
- Very tough.

24:50.562 --> 24:52.428
I kind of got a boner
talking to those girls.

24:52.430 --> 24:53.629
We're still on the phone.

24:53.631 --> 24:55.898
- Shit! Fuck, fuck.
- What the shit?!

24:58.570 --> 25:02.105
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

25:02.107 --> 25:05.611
11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

25:17.621 --> 25:19.557
Ow.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.464
Don't come any closer.

25:27.466 --> 25:30.132
- Why?
- 'Cause you could overpower us.

25:30.134 --> 25:32.135
So, put the drone

25:32.137 --> 25:34.704
on the slide, and count back
from a hundred,

25:34.706 --> 25:36.473
and close your eyes.

25:36.475 --> 25:38.073
And don't try anything funny.

25:38.075 --> 25:39.708
There are witnesses.

25:39.710 --> 25:42.111
Okay, we have a long drive
ahead of us,

25:42.113 --> 25:44.580
so give us the bag
or I will hurt you.

25:44.582 --> 25:45.715
Do not test me.

25:45.717 --> 25:47.817
Threats will get you nowhere,
peasant.

25:47.819 --> 25:49.386
Just give us the fucking Molly!

25:49.388 --> 25:52.955
Okay. Who's Molly?
'Cause she's not with us.

25:52.957 --> 25:54.690
Guys.

25:54.692 --> 25:58.727
Molly is a sex drug.
<i>Dateline</i> did an exposé on it.

25:58.729 --> 26:02.599
You had us bring drugs
to a fucking playground?!

26:02.601 --> 26:04.634
There are children here!

26:04.636 --> 26:06.735
- Shit.
- It's okay.

26:06.737 --> 26:08.036
I know what to do.

26:08.038 --> 26:10.106
We're making
a citizen's arrest!

26:10.108 --> 26:11.640
You're both under arrest!

26:11.642 --> 26:12.942
- Get on the ground!
- Sweet Jesus.

26:12.944 --> 26:14.444
- Up, up, up!
- Stay still!

26:14.446 --> 26:16.178
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Stay still!

26:16.180 --> 26:19.549
Get down now!
Get down now!

26:19.551 --> 26:21.117
Did you just reload
your fake gun?

26:21.119 --> 26:22.619
- Are you mocking me?
- Put your hands up!

26:22.621 --> 26:23.786
Are you mocking me?!

26:23.788 --> 26:25.487
Anything will be used
against you

26:25.489 --> 26:27.490
- that you say.
- In court.

26:27.492 --> 26:28.957
You know, you're the one
holding drugs,

26:28.959 --> 26:31.427
so why don't I do
a citizen's arrest on you?

26:31.429 --> 26:32.861
Fuck.

26:32.863 --> 26:34.664
Time-out, crackheads.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.198
Oh, my God.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.869
Deal's off. We can't let them
put drugs back on the street.

26:39.871 --> 26:41.771
Look at those dirty
fucking junkies.

26:41.773 --> 26:43.572
Their lives are already ruined.

26:43.574 --> 26:45.742
Let's just give them the drugs
and get the drone.

26:45.744 --> 26:48.878
Maybe there's a way we can

26:48.880 --> 26:51.548
protect our community
and get the drone back.

26:51.550 --> 26:53.515
Stall them.

26:53.517 --> 26:57.520
So, what do you plan to do
with those drugs, huh?

26:57.522 --> 26:59.555
Take 'em and feel amazing.

26:59.557 --> 27:01.757
They're addicts.

27:01.759 --> 27:03.091
Yeah.

27:03.093 --> 27:05.895
So, you been drugging
your whole life?

27:05.897 --> 27:07.930
- Uh-huh.
- E'r'day.

27:07.932 --> 27:09.131
Oh. Nice.

27:09.133 --> 27:10.766
What's he doing? Hey.

27:13.071 --> 27:15.038
- Yes! Yes!
- It's working!

27:15.040 --> 27:16.005
- It's working!
- Yes!

27:16.007 --> 27:18.608
Fly it to the school!

27:18.610 --> 27:20.176
You're heading for the trees! Watch out!

27:20.178 --> 27:21.880
We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

27:26.051 --> 27:27.720
Fuck!

27:32.923 --> 27:34.957
Those girls are lucky
I didn't kick their asses.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.593
Oh, no! They found us!

27:37.595 --> 27:40.096
- Oh, shit.
- They're on school property.

27:40.098 --> 27:42.168
They don't care.
They're tweaking.

27:44.503 --> 27:46.569
You know who we need?

27:46.571 --> 27:47.870
- No, don't say it.
- We'll look like losers.

27:47.872 --> 27:49.872
- Don't say it. Don't say it.
- SCAB!

27:49.874 --> 27:51.107
- Shut up.
- SCAB!

27:51.109 --> 27:52.809
- Shut up. Zip it.
- Lucas, shut up.

27:52.811 --> 27:54.610
- SCAB!
- What is that?

27:54.612 --> 27:56.044
There's three boys in danger!

27:56.046 --> 27:58.881
We're scared!
SCAB, help us!

27:58.883 --> 28:00.884
We're okay.

28:00.886 --> 28:02.551
- We're not scared. We're... we're fine.
- Lucas, shut up.

28:02.553 --> 28:04.153
Just walking into school.

28:04.155 --> 28:05.053
- Average day.
- Jesus Christ.

28:05.055 --> 28:06.222
Bullying is wack.

28:06.224 --> 28:08.558
Get on the right track.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.092
Bullying is wack.

28:10.094 --> 28:12.829
Get on the right track.

28:12.831 --> 28:15.865
Bullying is wack.

28:15.867 --> 28:18.734
Get on the right track.

28:18.736 --> 28:21.140
Bullying is wack.

28:26.244 --> 28:28.878
When you attack one of us,

28:28.880 --> 28:30.612
you attack all of us.

28:30.614 --> 28:32.215
Your weakness
gives us strength.

28:32.217 --> 28:34.984
- Well, those kids stole my bag.
- Not today, bully!

28:34.986 --> 28:37.719
Not today.

28:37.721 --> 28:39.187
- What the fuck?
- Bullying is wack.

28:39.189 --> 28:41.590
Get on the right track.

28:41.592 --> 28:43.158
This is the best day
of my life.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.593
Get on the right track.

28:44.595 --> 28:46.931
Don't worry,
we'll find them later.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.834
SCAB just tagged us
on Instagram.

28:52.836 --> 28:55.204
First Sippy Cup, and now this?

28:55.206 --> 28:58.006
I'm two weeks into sixth grade,
I'm already a social piranha.

28:58.008 --> 29:00.275
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.

29:00.277 --> 29:02.779
If we don't get a new drone
by then, I'm grounded.

29:02.781 --> 29:05.013
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,

29:05.015 --> 29:06.715
which means no Brixlee.

29:06.717 --> 29:09.118
- Sippy Cup for life.
- No Brixlee,

29:09.120 --> 29:11.286
no friends, no hope,

29:11.288 --> 29:14.624
parents fighting,
trapped in our rooms,

29:14.626 --> 29:17.859
all alone, two Taco Tuesdays.

29:17.861 --> 29:21.166
So, Max, what are we gonna do?

29:23.301 --> 29:25.834
We're gonna ditch school
and get a new drone.

29:25.836 --> 29:27.971
Stop thinking with
your big old dick, Max.

29:27.973 --> 29:29.973
That could go on
our permanent record.

29:29.975 --> 29:32.942
Max's big old dick is pointing
us in the right direction.

29:32.944 --> 29:35.978
Thank you. If anyone else
kisses Brixlee, I'll die.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.914
Wait, what?
Here's the plan.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.014
I'm gonna bring a beer
to Soren's,

29:39.016 --> 29:41.016
and I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...

29:41.018 --> 29:43.653
That you're an alcoholic.

29:43.655 --> 29:44.887
- That would be great.
- Guys.

29:44.889 --> 29:46.656
The only place around here
that has one

29:46.658 --> 29:47.790
is at North Point Galleria.

29:47.792 --> 29:49.224
That's four miles away.

29:49.226 --> 29:53.161
Four miles? How the fuck
are we getting four miles?

29:53.163 --> 29:54.830
- You have Uber.
- No, it goes directly

29:54.832 --> 29:56.799
to my mom's phone.
She'll know.

29:56.801 --> 29:58.400
Then we bike.

29:58.402 --> 30:01.272
Where are you even gonna get
the money for a new drone?

30:02.740 --> 30:05.308
- What?
- You know.

30:05.310 --> 30:08.677
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?
No way!

30:08.679 --> 30:12.048
You said everyone wants
to buy it.

30:12.050 --> 30:13.916
- We got it together.
- And we're gonna

30:13.918 --> 30:15.685
sell it together, as friends.

30:15.687 --> 30:16.918
Come on, Lucas.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.289
Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

30:19.923 --> 30:21.724
Okay.

30:21.726 --> 30:23.426
Guess that makes sense.

30:23.428 --> 30:24.293
- Yes!
- Yes!

30:24.295 --> 30:27.362
- Lucas! Bean Bag Boys for life.
- Yeah!

30:27.364 --> 30:29.233
We're being so bad.

30:30.869 --> 30:33.069
♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪

30:33.071 --> 30:35.303
♪ We're bad,
we're so bad ♪

30:35.305 --> 30:37.742
♪ We're bad, we're so bad. ♪

30:52.690 --> 30:54.823
I need to get rid
of these drugs.

30:54.825 --> 30:57.326
- What are you doing?!
- Getting rid of the drugs!

30:57.328 --> 31:00.096
I'm just gonna throw them
in the stream.

31:00.098 --> 31:01.930
It can contaminate the water.

31:01.932 --> 31:03.366
Well, then we can throw it
in the forest.

31:03.368 --> 31:04.501
It's a sex drug.

31:04.503 --> 31:07.203
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?

31:07.205 --> 31:08.705
It'll kill him.

31:08.707 --> 31:10.305
Well, then how do we
get rid of drugs?

31:10.307 --> 31:12.407
The same way
we get rid of a baby.

31:12.409 --> 31:13.709
- Abortion?
- Adoption?

31:13.711 --> 31:14.910
No.

31:14.912 --> 31:17.413
We drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.

31:17.415 --> 31:20.148
That's a really good idea.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.984
Ah. I just got a bite
on our card.

31:22.986 --> 31:24.721
Nice. Give 'em my address.

31:24.723 --> 31:26.822
My parents aren't home,
and I have the best snacks.

31:26.824 --> 31:29.358
PeterPan69 is gonna be here

31:29.360 --> 31:31.293
in five minutes
to buy the card.

31:31.295 --> 31:32.762
Well, let's get ready.

31:32.764 --> 31:34.097
I found all of these weapons

31:34.099 --> 31:35.868
in the back
of my parents' closet.

31:40.037 --> 31:42.237
I still don't get
why we need weapons.

31:42.239 --> 31:43.773
He could be a pedophile.

31:43.775 --> 31:45.041
He can't molest
all three of us.

31:45.043 --> 31:47.045
All he needs is one.

31:51.015 --> 31:53.182
"An-al beads"?

31:53.184 --> 31:55.984
Aka nunchucks, motherfucker.

31:55.986 --> 31:57.219
Ooh.

31:57.221 --> 31:59.856
- Yeah!
- It's not a toy.

32:01.191 --> 32:03.826
Oh, shoot.

32:03.828 --> 32:06.061
They smell like shit.

32:13.505 --> 32:16.539
Hello.
Uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

32:16.541 --> 32:19.175
- That's me.
- I'm Claude.

32:19.177 --> 32:20.243
Hey.

32:20.245 --> 32:22.811
That's my mom back there.

32:22.813 --> 32:24.382
Hi-ya!

32:26.150 --> 32:27.984
Let's cut the shit.
Are you a pedophile?

32:27.986 --> 32:29.417
What? No.

32:29.419 --> 32:31.020
Lucas, if you were a pedophile

32:31.022 --> 32:32.554
standing in front
of three single boys,

32:32.556 --> 32:35.057
- would you admit it?
- Probably not.

32:35.059 --> 32:36.292
Then why would he?

32:36.294 --> 32:37.859
Oh, come on.

32:37.861 --> 32:39.494
Do I look like a pedophile?

32:39.496 --> 32:40.897
- Sure do.
- Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%.

32:40.899 --> 32:42.497
That's not fair.

32:42.499 --> 32:45.301
You look more like a pedophile
than anyone I've ever seen.

32:45.303 --> 32:48.937
Look, I'm not a pedophile.
I'm a cool guy.

32:48.939 --> 32:52.274
Fine. You can come in,
but please take your shoes off.

32:52.276 --> 32:54.377
You know, I've searched
the world for this.

32:54.379 --> 32:56.411
Why are you bringing
the paintball gun?

32:56.413 --> 32:58.848
In case anyone fucks with us.

32:58.850 --> 33:00.949
This card is exquisite.

33:00.951 --> 33:03.151
- How'd you get it?
- The summer I moved here,

33:03.153 --> 33:06.254
me, Max and Thor started
a dog-washing business.

33:06.256 --> 33:08.357
We earned eight bucks,
and we used the money

33:08.359 --> 33:10.926
to buy an Ascension pack,
and this card was in it.

33:10.928 --> 33:12.461
Well, you got very lucky.

33:12.463 --> 33:14.563
The real luck
was meeting Max and Thor.

33:14.565 --> 33:15.997
Fascinating.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.265
We started calling ourself
the Bean Bag Boys.

33:17.267 --> 33:20.369
- You know why?
- Because you had some beanbags?

33:20.371 --> 33:22.972
- That's right.
- Yeah. Genius.

33:22.974 --> 33:24.307
You got yourself a deal.

33:27.044 --> 33:29.212
Let's go.
Let's make it happen.

33:31.448 --> 33:34.349
No, I can't do this.

33:34.351 --> 33:35.551
Sorry.

33:35.553 --> 33:37.853
Lucas, get your butt
over here right now.

33:37.855 --> 33:40.488
Excuse me, is this how all
12-year-olds conduct business?

33:40.490 --> 33:41.858
What the hell just happened?

33:41.860 --> 33:43.391
I thought you were cool
with this.

33:43.393 --> 33:46.161
You said we wouldn't do this
if one of us wasn't on board.

33:46.163 --> 33:48.496
- I'm not on board.
- Why do you care so much?

33:48.498 --> 33:49.965
Why don't you care?

33:49.967 --> 33:51.500
This card has
a lot of memories,

33:51.502 --> 33:53.269
and you're just gonna
throw it all away

33:53.271 --> 33:55.170
because you want to kiss
some basic girl?

33:55.172 --> 33:56.472
Savage.

33:56.474 --> 33:58.006
Brixlee isn't just some girl.

33:58.008 --> 33:59.609
We're probably
gonna get married.

33:59.611 --> 34:02.177
Every marriage ends in divorce.

34:02.179 --> 34:05.080
Lucas, you're outvoted.

34:05.082 --> 34:07.215
Listen, I can tell
you're lashing out with anger,

34:07.217 --> 34:09.150
but Brixlee is probably
the love of my life.

34:09.152 --> 34:12.987
Excuse me, ma'am. Can I get
a glass of water, please?

34:12.989 --> 34:14.293
Hello?

34:17.628 --> 34:20.329
Hey, guys?

34:20.331 --> 34:22.496
Hmm.

34:22.498 --> 34:24.300
Yeah.

34:24.302 --> 34:26.167
What can you tell me
about her backstory?

34:26.168 --> 34:27.303
Where is she supposed
to be from?

34:27.304 --> 34:28.335
She seems quite exotic.

34:28.338 --> 34:30.938
Okay, listen carefully,

34:30.940 --> 34:32.675
'cause I'll make this offer
only once.

34:32.677 --> 34:35.043
400 bucks to take her
off your hands.

34:35.045 --> 34:38.112
No. We need 550, U.S.

34:38.114 --> 34:39.681
Fuck off. What?

34:39.684 --> 34:41.684
That's my entire allowance.

34:41.686 --> 34:44.286
Listen, Claude,
let's just cut the bullshit.

34:44.289 --> 34:47.455
I'm the son of a businesswoman,
and I think we both know,

34:47.456 --> 34:49.456
if you didn't want
to buy the doll,

34:49.458 --> 34:51.193
you would've left already.

34:51.195 --> 34:54.129
Stop treating us like kids.
We know how things work.

34:54.130 --> 34:57.600
So, do you want to buy
the CPR doll or not?

35:01.305 --> 35:04.439
Fools.
I'd have paid a thousand.

35:04.441 --> 35:07.209
Anyone else feel like
he's gonna fuck that doll?

37:09.767 --> 37:11.200
- Are you okay?
- Lucas, are you okay?

37:11.202 --> 37:12.834
- What the hell happened?
- We were running away

37:12.836 --> 37:14.403
from our babysitter
'cause she was trying

37:14.405 --> 37:16.171
- to touch our penises.
- What? That is not true.

37:16.173 --> 37:17.506
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.
- I wasn't.

37:17.508 --> 37:19.111
- Yeah, you were.
- I wasn't...

37:20.410 --> 37:23.079
- Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go!
- What happened?

37:23.081 --> 37:24.312
Go, go!

37:24.314 --> 37:26.715
Lucas, are you okay?

37:26.717 --> 37:29.318
I-I think I'm fine.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.820
- - Your arm.
- Oh, hell no.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.591
Yo, I'm-a call 911.

37:36.593 --> 37:37.792
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no. It's okay.

37:37.794 --> 37:38.727
This happens all the time.

37:38.729 --> 37:40.229
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go. Go.

37:40.231 --> 37:42.097
- Help! Ow!
- We got... Come on.

37:42.099 --> 37:44.200
I'll get the bikes.

37:45.570 --> 37:48.137
Okay. I threw their phone
in a prickle bush.

37:48.139 --> 37:49.704
So they can't track us anymore.

37:49.706 --> 37:51.307
Oh, the pain!

37:51.309 --> 37:52.608
Lucas, you have to be quiet.

37:52.610 --> 37:55.176
Okay, do we have any ice?

37:55.178 --> 37:56.412
No, we're in a fucking alley.

37:56.414 --> 37:58.780
What about pain medication?

37:58.782 --> 38:01.216
- We have the Molly we can give him.
- No!

38:01.218 --> 38:02.785
Yeah, he's probably just gonna
try and have sex with us.

38:02.787 --> 38:04.120
Call an ambulance!

38:04.122 --> 38:06.421
- Mission's over!
- We'll get busted.

38:06.423 --> 38:08.858
- Plus, do you even have insurance?
- I don't know.

38:08.860 --> 38:10.593
- Do you?
- I don't know.

38:10.595 --> 38:12.595
- I think I only have a deductible.
- It's all right.

38:12.597 --> 38:14.597
This happens to MMA fighters
all the time.

38:14.599 --> 38:16.798
We just got to ram your arm
into something very hard

38:16.800 --> 38:18.503
so it pops back in place.

38:21.271 --> 38:23.539
Fine! Fuck it!
Let's just get this over with.

38:23.541 --> 38:24.673
Ow!

38:24.675 --> 38:27.475
- Come on.
- Easy. All right.

38:27.477 --> 38:29.845
One, two, three.

38:37.155 --> 38:39.220
Wrong arm!

38:39.222 --> 38:41.222
- Okay, new site, new site.
- Okay.

38:41.224 --> 38:43.559
Okay, lie down on your back
and give me your arm.

38:43.561 --> 38:45.660
Come on.

38:45.662 --> 38:48.564
All right. It says
this next part's gonna hurt,

38:48.566 --> 38:50.733
that you should bite down
on something hard.

38:50.735 --> 38:52.336
I know.

38:55.506 --> 38:57.606
Open. There you go.

38:57.608 --> 38:59.408
Okay.

38:59.410 --> 39:01.410
- On three.
- One,

39:01.412 --> 39:03.312
two, three.

39:03.314 --> 39:04.479
- Just got a text from Taylor.
- What'd she say?

39:04.481 --> 39:06.582
She wants to know
why you aren't in school

39:06.584 --> 39:08.350
and if you're coming
to the party tonight.

39:08.352 --> 39:09.651
Just write...

39:09.653 --> 39:10.818
Okay, sorry.
One, two, three!

39:12.657 --> 39:14.490
Oh!

39:14.492 --> 39:15.557
Let me help, let me help.

39:15.559 --> 39:16.791
- Focus! On three.
- One!

39:16.793 --> 39:18.727
Two! Three!

39:21.831 --> 39:24.200
Hmm?

39:24.202 --> 39:28.607
Wow. I didn't think that'd actually work.

39:30.874 --> 39:32.975
You're gonna be good, man.

39:32.977 --> 39:35.577
No.

39:35.579 --> 39:37.345
I'm really not.

39:37.347 --> 39:40.317
My parents are getting
a divorce.

39:42.352 --> 39:43.686
What'd you do?

39:43.688 --> 39:45.820
- Thor!
- What?

39:45.822 --> 39:47.789
Sorry.

39:51.428 --> 39:53.365
My dad's moving out.

39:54.798 --> 39:57.733
Whatever happens
between your parents,

39:57.735 --> 39:59.905
you always got
the Bean Bag Boys.

40:01.872 --> 40:04.472
We'll never split up.
Bean Bag Boys for life.

40:04.474 --> 40:06.441
You promise?

40:06.443 --> 40:07.475
- Promise.
- Promise.

40:07.477 --> 40:09.544
Come on.

40:09.546 --> 40:11.713
Let's get you some
Children's Tylenol.

40:20.624 --> 40:23.492
- Want some help, buddy?
- No, I got it.

40:23.494 --> 40:25.727
Okay, just do it.

40:31.602 --> 40:33.936
- Hey, Miles.
- Hey, man.

40:33.938 --> 40:35.738
- Coming in or coming off?
- Just got off a triple.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.740
Man, I don't care
if I get mugged.

40:37.742 --> 40:39.910
I'm not typing up
any more paperwork today.

40:40.945 --> 40:42.247
Cop.

40:45.682 --> 40:47.483
Shit.
We have D-R-U-G-S on us.

40:47.485 --> 40:49.684
He knows how to spell.
Just act normal.

40:49.686 --> 40:52.287
- Pretend to talk.
- About what?

40:52.289 --> 40:53.955
Just be normal.

40:53.957 --> 40:56.892
What do you think
about politics?

40:56.894 --> 40:58.763
It's a complicated issue.

41:00.064 --> 41:01.796
This cop's acting weird.

41:01.798 --> 41:03.666
He's eye-fucking us.

41:03.668 --> 41:05.033
Just act normal.
Just laugh.

41:05.035 --> 41:06.901
We're just
two cool guys laughing.

41:12.677 --> 41:14.309
We skipped school.

41:14.311 --> 41:15.477
Lucas!

41:16.747 --> 41:18.347
Are we in trouble?

41:18.349 --> 41:20.948
Yeah, well, usually,
I'd call this in,

41:20.950 --> 41:23.352
but because you were
honest with me,

41:23.354 --> 41:24.753
I'm gonna let you slide,
all right?

41:24.755 --> 41:26.655
Just promise
not to do it again, okay?

41:26.657 --> 41:28.457
We promise.
Thank you, sir.

41:28.459 --> 41:29.291
All right.

41:29.293 --> 41:31.026
That was a close one.

42:12.669 --> 42:14.970
Schedule I
controlled substance,

42:14.972 --> 42:16.908
with intent to distribute.

42:18.142 --> 42:19.975
Brother,
these are vitamins, okay?

42:19.977 --> 42:21.709
Children's vitamins, at that.

42:21.711 --> 42:23.379
- No, those are drugs.
- No, look.

42:23.381 --> 42:25.513
If that's drugs,
then this is drugs, too.

42:25.515 --> 42:27.582
- If you don't arrest us, I'll report you.
- Lucas!

42:27.584 --> 42:29.417
Just leave me the fuck alone!

42:29.419 --> 42:31.086
I mean, sorry to fucking swear
at kids, but fuck.

42:31.088 --> 42:33.122

42:41.999 --> 42:45.434
Hello. Listen.
I've decided I don't want kids.

42:45.436 --> 42:47.669
- What's up?
- The cop's eye-fucking us.

42:47.671 --> 42:50.539
We have to make a run for it.
I know what to do.

42:50.541 --> 42:52.173
Well, no, it's not
up for discu...

42:52.175 --> 42:53.941
Well, yeah, well, no, you may be detective,

but in the marriage
we're equal.

42:55.012 --> 42:56.412

42:56.414 --> 42:57.716

You didn't even care
about my shoulder.

43:22.673 --> 43:25.640
- You just wanted a beer.
- I can care about two things.

43:25.642 --> 43:27.642
Yeah, you and your stupid beer!

43:27.644 --> 43:30.778
- Now we're fugitives!
- Why are you yelling at me?

43:30.780 --> 43:33.080
I just ran off
without my family's bikes.

43:33.082 --> 43:36.084
- Cycle Sundays are fucked!
- Guys, guys.

43:36.086 --> 43:37.553
The mall!

43:38.956 --> 43:40.988
- Yes! Yes! - Yes!
- We made it!

43:40.990 --> 43:43.591
- Yes!
- Yes!

43:43.593 --> 43:45.160
Come on, come on, come on.

43:47.764 --> 43:49.967
- Oh, shit.
- Holy mother...

43:51.968 --> 43:53.468
Goddamn it!

43:53.470 --> 43:55.204
Great.

43:55.206 --> 43:58.106
Now we're trapped between
a highway and the authorities.

43:58.108 --> 43:59.908
Well, we wouldn't be
in this position right now

43:59.910 --> 44:01.075
if you weren't such a narc.

44:01.077 --> 44:03.678
Guys, the mall's right there.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.513
All we have to do
is cross the highway,

44:05.515 --> 44:07.015
and the cars
aren't even moving.

44:07.017 --> 44:11.119

or are we sixth-graders?

44:25.869 --> 44:28.003
Well, I'm going back
into the woods.

44:28.005 --> 44:29.905
I'll live off of rainwater
and squirrels.

44:29.907 --> 44:31.240
I don't give a fuck.

44:31.242 --> 44:33.075
Uh, no, you won't.

44:33.077 --> 44:34.510
- Oh, my gosh!
- No, no.

44:34.512 --> 44:35.947
It's-it's like
a parking lot, see?

44:37.113 --> 44:39.548
Wait!
You stole another beer?

44:39.550 --> 44:41.015
- What the fuck, Thor?
- Hey.

44:41.017 --> 44:42.651
You guys aren't the ones
who's gonna have

44:42.653 --> 44:44.586
"Sippy Cup"
on their goddamn tombstone!

44:44.588 --> 44:46.622
God.
Say it, don't spray it.

44:48.626 --> 44:50.791
Get off the freeway!

44:50.793 --> 44:51.926
Children crossing.

44:51.928 --> 44:53.662
- Please, children are crossing.
- Get off the road.

44:55.265 --> 44:58.166
- What are you guys doing? Get back to the side.
- Go!

44:58.168 --> 45:00.068
- Go, go, go, go. - Now.
- Fucking idiots!

45:00.070 --> 45:03.604
Wait. I got a message.

45:03.606 --> 45:04.939
Oh, it's from Taylor.

45:04.941 --> 45:06.675
She said Marcus is
coming to the party.

45:06.677 --> 45:08.042
He has a huge crush on Brixlee.

45:08.044 --> 45:10.044
She's definitely
gonna kiss him.

45:10.046 --> 45:12.580
- He's the nicest kid in our grade.
- Wait, wait.

45:12.582 --> 45:13.981
I'm the nicest kid
in our grade.

45:13.983 --> 45:18.086
It goes me, Marcus, Max, you.

45:18.088 --> 45:20.856
- I'm way nicer than Max.
- No, you're not!

45:20.858 --> 45:22.925
You made Ms. Willoughby cry
last year.

45:22.927 --> 45:25.026
Hey, she was already crying.
I just took her picture.

45:25.028 --> 45:26.928
Guys, guys! Look!

45:26.930 --> 45:28.265
- It started.
- Oh, shit.

45:29.599 --> 45:31.800
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck.

45:31.802 --> 45:33.200
- Let's go back!
- Let's go back!

45:34.204 --> 45:35.803
We're trapped.

45:35.805 --> 45:37.842
Let us out!

45:40.177 --> 45:42.811
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

45:42.813 --> 45:45.079
- No, we're not. We just need to time it, okay?
- Oh, fuck!

45:45.081 --> 45:46.247
- We just need to time it right.
- Shit!

45:46.249 --> 45:48.986
We can do this, guys.
We can do this!

45:50.653 --> 45:52.620
N-No!

45:53.990 --> 45:56.091
- Max, no!
- Are you batshit crazy?!

45:56.093 --> 45:58.327
What the fuck are you doing?!

45:59.796 --> 46:03.097
- Oh, shit. He made it.
- Oh!

46:03.099 --> 46:04.600
I did it!

46:04.602 --> 46:06.867
Lucas, Lucas,
look at me right now.

46:06.869 --> 46:08.070
I know you're scared.

46:08.072 --> 46:09.370
I'm not, at all...

46:09.372 --> 46:10.838
Shut up, Thor!

46:12.675 --> 46:15.276
- Lucas, fuck you! No!
- Shit! Shit!

46:15.278 --> 46:16.278
Lucas!

46:18.849 --> 46:21.048
No! Lucas!

46:21.050 --> 46:23.218
I'm not dead!

46:23.220 --> 46:25.620
- I'm not dead!
- All right.

46:25.622 --> 46:27.356
- You got it, man. Come on.
- Yes! Yes!

46:27.358 --> 46:29.624
- Fuck you!
- I love you, too.

46:29.626 --> 46:30.959
Now, come over here.

46:30.961 --> 46:32.126
I want my mom.

46:32.128 --> 46:33.695
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

46:33.697 --> 46:35.696
I'm fine.
I'll just live here.

46:35.698 --> 46:37.064
- I-I'm good.
- Come on!

46:37.066 --> 46:39.166
- Come on!
- You got this!

46:39.168 --> 46:41.003
All right. Come on, Thor.

46:41.005 --> 46:43.771
You are not Sippy Cup.
You're a badass.

46:43.773 --> 46:46.073
Come on, come on!

46:46.075 --> 46:48.343
Oh, shit! My beer!

46:57.720 --> 47:00.023
Oh, shit!

47:06.930 --> 47:08.129
- Oh!
- Oh, wait.

47:08.131 --> 47:10.097
That's my dad's CPR doll.

47:10.099 --> 47:11.867
- Oh.
- That's my dad's CPR doll!

47:11.869 --> 47:13.669
- We're not murderers!
- Yes!

47:13.671 --> 47:15.236
- We're saved!
- We're not fucking killers!

47:15.238 --> 47:17.204
- We're not killers!
- Yes!

47:25.416 --> 47:27.048
Beep, beep.

47:27.050 --> 47:28.316
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

47:28.318 --> 47:29.950
- Pardon me. Sorry.
- Hey!

47:29.952 --> 47:31.221
Excuse me.
Got to get through.

47:32.256 --> 47:33.358
Sorry.

47:36.325 --> 47:39.193
Hey. We called about
the BD Rolling Thunder.

47:39.195 --> 47:41.296
I'm so sorry, you guys.

47:41.298 --> 47:43.131
Sold it.

47:43.133 --> 47:44.700
Ha-ha. Nice joke.

47:44.702 --> 47:46.367
So funny.

47:46.369 --> 47:49.403
No, I did. I sold it.
Two girls, said they knew you.

47:49.405 --> 47:51.305
Fuck you!

47:51.307 --> 47:53.475
- Jesus.
- I'm gonna kill your family, and then they're

47:53.477 --> 47:55.276
- gonna come alive...
- Ease off the sugar, huh?

47:55.278 --> 47:57.278
- ...and turn your whole family into zombies!
- Max!

47:57.280 --> 48:01.383
I was gonna say...
you didn't let me finish...

48:01.385 --> 48:03.251
they left a note for you.

48:09.727 --> 48:11.492
Why are they walking like that?

48:11.494 --> 48:13.061
I don't know.

48:15.965 --> 48:18.200
How'd you guys track us?

48:18.202 --> 48:19.767
We threw your bag
in prickle bushes.

48:19.769 --> 48:21.870
Dumbass, you told us
that your life would be over

48:21.872 --> 48:23.771
if you didn't get
a BD Rolling Thunder,

48:23.773 --> 48:25.173
and this is the only place

48:25.175 --> 48:27.408
- a child could get to on a tricycle.
- Okay.

48:27.410 --> 48:29.380
I have the drugs.
Now give me the drone.

48:33.751 --> 48:35.086
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:37.454 --> 48:40.155
What in the actual fuck?
These are just gummy vitamins.

48:40.157 --> 48:41.356
- Shit.
- Told you she was gonna check.

48:41.358 --> 48:42.791
- Fuck.
- Where is the Molly?

48:42.793 --> 48:45.160
- Where is it?
- A cop has it.

48:45.162 --> 48:47.329
You gave our drugs to a cop?

48:47.331 --> 48:48.763
Wait. Look.

48:48.765 --> 48:50.097
I know you don't know us

48:50.099 --> 48:51.767
and you think
we're just stupid kids,

48:51.769 --> 48:52.834
but just listen to me.

48:52.836 --> 48:54.269
Whatever problems
you're having,

48:54.271 --> 48:55.937
drugs are not the answer.

48:55.939 --> 48:58.939
Drugs just give you
a false sense of reality.

48:58.941 --> 49:00.941
You may think
your lives are bad,

49:00.943 --> 49:03.879
but you have family
and friends who love you.

49:03.881 --> 49:05.213
Can you shut the fuck up?

49:05.215 --> 49:07.082
I just spent $600
on a fucking drone.

49:07.084 --> 49:08.816
You ruined
my passionate moment.

49:08.818 --> 49:11.820
- Well, it was stupid.
- This day is fucked.

49:11.822 --> 49:13.088
Benji is the only one
who has Molly,

49:13.090 --> 49:14.256
and he won't sell it to us.

49:14.258 --> 49:16.091
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

49:16.093 --> 49:17.825
We're fucked.

49:17.827 --> 49:20.163
We'll do it.
We'll get your drugs.

49:21.497 --> 49:23.865
- The fuck we will.
- What the hell, dude?

49:23.867 --> 49:25.533
Do you think
he would sell to kids?

49:25.535 --> 49:27.169
We're not kids.

49:27.171 --> 49:28.370
We're tweens.

49:28.372 --> 49:30.508
What do we have to lose?

49:33.075 --> 49:34.811
So, it's a deal?

49:36.213 --> 49:38.012
Max, this is fucking insane.

49:38.014 --> 49:39.548
Just take
your goddamn punishment.

49:39.550 --> 49:41.515
Lucas and I
will go to the party.

49:41.517 --> 49:43.852
We'll cock-block anyone
that gets near Brixlee.

49:43.854 --> 49:46.555
They didn't invite you.

49:46.557 --> 49:48.289
What?

49:48.291 --> 49:51.392
The popular kids
only invited me.

49:51.394 --> 49:53.128
What do you mean?

49:53.130 --> 49:55.997
They think you're kind of...
random.

49:55.999 --> 49:58.133
- Oh.
- But it's okay,

49:58.135 --> 50:00.267
'cause once those guys
get to know you,

50:00.269 --> 50:02.470
they'll see what I see,
that you're not random.

50:02.472 --> 50:04.004
That you're specific.

50:04.006 --> 50:05.407
I'm not buying drugs.

50:05.409 --> 50:07.475
- Neither am I.
- You guys don't have to.

50:07.477 --> 50:09.443
I'll do all the talking. I just
need your height in there.

50:09.445 --> 50:11.412
You're the only one of us

50:11.414 --> 50:13.481
that looks like
they could be in college.

50:13.483 --> 50:16.084
Guys.

50:16.086 --> 50:18.089
Are you in or out?

50:20.122 --> 50:22.256
So, you guys did all of this
for a kissing party?

50:22.258 --> 50:25.026
No. There's also gonna be
cool boys there.

50:25.028 --> 50:26.861
I remember my first
kissing party.

50:26.863 --> 50:28.396
It was the summer
after sixth grade

50:28.398 --> 50:29.965
at Manush Patel's house.

50:29.967 --> 50:31.166
Who'd you kiss?

50:31.168 --> 50:33.300
Uh, Manush's sister.

50:33.302 --> 50:34.903
Wait, you weren't there?

50:34.905 --> 50:36.403
No, we didn't really
know each other then.

50:36.405 --> 50:38.240
I mean, we were in
the same grade,

50:38.242 --> 50:40.242
but we didn't really become
close until eighth grade.

50:40.244 --> 50:42.376
Oh. I just figured you guys

50:42.378 --> 50:44.479
- knew each other for longer.
- Yeah, everybody knows

50:44.481 --> 50:46.548
you meet your best friends
in kindergarten.

50:46.550 --> 50:48.115
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the only reason

50:48.117 --> 50:49.416
you're friends with people
back then

50:49.418 --> 50:51.051
is 'cause you live close
to each other.

50:51.053 --> 50:52.254
Or, because, like,
your parents are friends.

50:52.256 --> 50:54.122
No. That's not true for us.

50:54.124 --> 50:56.124
We're friends
because we like each other.

50:56.126 --> 50:59.494
- And we live close together.
- And our parents are friends.

51:09.039 --> 51:11.138
Okay, come here.

51:11.140 --> 51:13.908
Go in. Buy two pills.

51:13.910 --> 51:15.343
Ask for Benji.

51:15.345 --> 51:16.945
Do not mention Hannah.

51:16.947 --> 51:19.247
- Who's Hannah?
- I am.

51:19.249 --> 51:21.548
Oh. I'm Max.

51:21.550 --> 51:23.050
Yeah, I know who you are.

51:23.052 --> 51:25.287
Okay, just go in there,
buy the pills,

51:25.289 --> 51:27.191
and then I'll trade you
for the drone.

51:29.392 --> 51:32.327
Okay, if this goes bad,
drive off.

51:32.329 --> 51:33.928
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:33.930 --> 51:35.696
It's not too late to turn back.

51:35.698 --> 51:37.698
No. We have to get the drugs

51:37.700 --> 51:41.035
so we can get the drone,
so we can go to the party.

52:04.061 --> 52:05.930
Hello?

52:13.736 --> 52:15.637
I am your daddy!

52:15.639 --> 52:17.638
You are my baby!

52:17.640 --> 52:20.108
Listen, you will stay
down here and suffer

52:20.110 --> 52:22.242
until you learn to be men!

52:24.581 --> 52:27.414
Listen!
What you babies wearing?

52:27.416 --> 52:29.651
- Diapers!
- That's right!

52:31.454 --> 52:34.622
Good evening.
We're looking for Benji.

52:37.327 --> 52:39.260
Hey, dickless. Come here.

52:39.262 --> 52:42.129
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right, I need you to go find Benji.

52:42.131 --> 52:43.597
Tell him he's got visitors.

52:43.599 --> 52:45.265
Yes, Daddy.

52:45.267 --> 52:47.234
I ask the fucking questions!

52:47.236 --> 52:48.769
That's your son?

52:48.771 --> 52:52.240
You guys can go sit your
asses down over there and wait.

52:52.242 --> 52:55.075
Whatever happens to you is

52:55.077 --> 52:56.378
your own fucking fault.

52:56.380 --> 52:58.713
Drop and give me 20,
you fucking babies!

53:00.450 --> 53:03.251
Listen!

53:03.253 --> 53:06.021
Four! Get up!

53:07.490 --> 53:09.024
Can I help you?

53:09.026 --> 53:10.358
Good afternoon.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.997
We would like to buy
two pieces of Molly, please.

53:17.434 --> 53:20.068
Did Rafi from Sigma Nu
send you?

53:20.070 --> 53:21.301
He did, that fucker.

53:21.303 --> 53:23.271
You guys are, like, seven.

53:23.273 --> 53:25.173
Oh, except for you.
I recognize you from econ.

53:25.175 --> 53:26.276
What's up, man?

53:27.610 --> 53:30.378
Seriously,
I'm not selling drugs to kids.

53:30.380 --> 53:32.148
We're not kids.
We're tweens.

53:33.717 --> 53:35.749
Who told you to come here?

53:35.751 --> 53:38.621
Sell us the drugs,
and you'll find out.

53:43.226 --> 53:44.595
All right.

53:45.628 --> 53:47.428
Stay there.

53:52.802 --> 53:54.803
Hey.

53:54.805 --> 53:57.508
How long do you think
he's gonna be?

54:01.544 --> 54:04.546
Oh, you made me high.

54:13.356 --> 54:15.256
Ah.

54:15.258 --> 54:17.528
Tell me who sent you.

54:19.829 --> 54:21.729
Hannah.

54:21.731 --> 54:23.530
What? I'm high as fuck.

54:24.633 --> 54:27.869
So, this is what
she thinks of me, huh?

54:27.871 --> 54:31.840
You can tell Hannah
that if she wants Molly,

54:31.842 --> 54:33.575
she can suck my dick.

54:33.577 --> 54:36.144
You shouldn't talk about
women like that.

54:36.146 --> 54:38.245
The only time
she should suck your dick

54:38.247 --> 54:40.150
is when she gives you consent.

54:41.318 --> 54:43.283
You can suck my dick,

54:43.285 --> 54:45.285
and you can suck
my dick, too.

54:45.287 --> 54:47.624
What about me?
I'm just gonna sit here?

54:49.726 --> 54:52.227
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
We do everything together.

54:52.229 --> 54:54.495
Get the fuck out of here,
you little fucking babies.

54:54.497 --> 54:55.499
Let's go.

54:56.566 --> 54:58.566
Get out!

55:00.871 --> 55:02.704
Hey, guys, wait.

55:02.706 --> 55:04.372
I have something in here

55:04.374 --> 55:06.707
that might change your mind.

55:06.709 --> 55:08.475
Hurry up.

55:08.477 --> 55:10.211
Pledges, listen!

55:10.213 --> 55:12.280
Bitch! Now who's the baby?!

55:12.282 --> 55:14.381
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

55:14.383 --> 55:16.550
If I don't get those drugs,
I'm gonna be grounded,

55:16.552 --> 55:18.720
and then I'll never
get to kiss Brixlee!

55:18.722 --> 55:21.356
Max, what the fuck
are you doing?

55:21.358 --> 55:23.591
You sell drugs.
We came here to buy them.

55:23.593 --> 55:26.294
So now you're gonna
sell us the drugs.

55:26.296 --> 55:28.363
Do not test me!

55:28.365 --> 55:30.301
Okay.

55:32.434 --> 55:34.501
You want the drugs?
I'm not your parent. Here.

55:34.503 --> 55:35.769
Thanks.

55:35.771 --> 55:37.373
Oh, shit.

55:38.675 --> 55:39.908
Oh, you're fucking dead.

55:43.280 --> 55:44.879
What the fuck's going on
down here?

55:44.881 --> 55:47.414
Whoa!

55:47.416 --> 55:49.450
She just dropped the charges.

55:49.452 --> 55:50.751
Oh, God.

55:54.657 --> 55:56.691
♪ You'd better run ♪

55:56.693 --> 55:57.691
♪ You'd better run ♪

55:57.693 --> 55:59.260
Holy shit.

55:59.262 --> 56:01.595
♪ You'd better run
from the Devil's gun... ♪

56:03.599 --> 56:05.566
Max, watch out!

56:08.771 --> 56:10.537
I got your back.

56:10.539 --> 56:11.838
Thor!

56:14.811 --> 56:16.577
Your ass is mine!

56:20.249 --> 56:22.383
Oh, my God,
I just killed a man!

56:22.385 --> 56:23.952
Lucas, get the drugs!

56:23.954 --> 56:25.553
♪ The Devil's fire ♪

56:25.555 --> 56:27.358
♪ Just won't go out... ♪

56:28.358 --> 56:30.591
We were never here!

56:30.593 --> 56:33.227
Start the fucking car!

56:33.229 --> 56:34.595
Max!

56:34.597 --> 56:37.365
- What's happening?
- Fucking go!

56:37.367 --> 56:38.832
- What?
- Shit, shit, shit!

56:40.302 --> 56:41.970
Drive! Drive!

56:50.947 --> 56:53.416
Lucas, drugs.

56:54.550 --> 56:55.617
No, no, no, no, no.

56:55.619 --> 56:56.950
Let me see
what's in the bottle.

56:56.952 --> 57:00.323
Yeah. Of course.

57:02.959 --> 57:05.026
Okay, just-just give it to me.

57:11.468 --> 57:13.600
Wow, you guys are
little badasses.

57:13.602 --> 57:15.736
'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.

57:15.738 --> 57:17.738
I don't know what that means.

57:17.740 --> 57:18.943
We have beanbags.

57:21.778 --> 57:22.846
It's been real, guys.

57:23.979 --> 57:25.812
Have fun at your kissing party.

57:25.814 --> 57:27.515
Thank you.

57:31.621 --> 57:34.724
Oh.
We're only 1.7 miles away.

57:37.660 --> 57:39.059
What's wrong?

57:39.061 --> 57:40.662
We got the drone.
Everything worked out.

57:40.664 --> 57:42.329
Max.

57:42.331 --> 57:45.033
I got punched
in the fucking face, okay?

57:45.035 --> 57:47.401
We bought drugs.

57:47.403 --> 57:49.437
Can we just go home now?

58:00.717 --> 58:03.450
Guys, it's my dad.

58:03.452 --> 58:04.751
Hey, Dad.

58:04.753 --> 58:06.421
Hey, buddy.
I got on the early flight,

58:06.423 --> 58:08.523
so I'll be home in 15 minutes.

58:08.525 --> 58:10.925
15 minutes from now
or 15 minutes from later?

58:10.927 --> 58:13.061
Ha-ha, funny guy.

58:13.063 --> 58:14.829
I'll see you soon.

58:14.831 --> 58:17.030
My dad will be home
in 15 minutes.

58:17.032 --> 58:19.700
M-Maybe he won't notice
that the drone's gone.

58:19.702 --> 58:21.702
He'll notice.
He's very observant.

58:21.704 --> 58:24.472
That's why my mom
fell in love with him.

58:24.474 --> 58:26.474
The drone has to be home
before your dad.

58:26.476 --> 58:28.108
I know.

58:28.110 --> 58:30.678
Just the drone. Not you.

58:30.680 --> 58:33.050
Just the drone.

58:37.052 --> 58:39.355
Okay.

58:42.057 --> 58:43.423
Here we go.

58:43.425 --> 58:45.392
- Yes!
- Yes!

58:48.831 --> 58:50.800
- Careful.
- I got this, I got this. Oh!

58:52.802 --> 58:54.470
Fly like the wind, Max.

58:55.572 --> 58:57.707
Yeah, uh, take a right up here.

58:59.909 --> 59:01.608
- I can see your house.
- There it is. There it is.

59:01.610 --> 59:03.577
The windows are closed.

59:03.579 --> 59:05.515
- Shit. What do I do?
- The chimney.

59:11.086 --> 59:14.155
- It's very tight.
- You got this.

59:14.157 --> 59:15.523
Shit! I can't see.
I can't see.

59:15.525 --> 59:17.425
There's ash
all over the camera.

59:17.427 --> 59:18.593
Use the Force.

59:18.595 --> 59:19.727
- No, no, I can do this.
- Uh...

59:19.729 --> 59:20.928
I know my house perfectly.

59:20.930 --> 59:22.729
- I can do this with my eyes closed.
- Okay.

59:22.731 --> 59:24.131
Don't break anything.

59:24.133 --> 59:26.033
Trust me, I got this.

59:43.052 --> 59:44.952
- Yeah!
- You did it! You got it!

59:44.954 --> 59:47.021
- Yes!
- I'm the best pilot ever!

59:47.023 --> 59:48.455
Yes!

59:57.066 --> 59:58.733
- I think we did it.
- Yeah.

59:58.735 --> 01:00:00.901
Mission accomplished.

01:00:00.903 --> 01:00:03.204
Hey, Dad.

01:00:03.206 --> 01:00:05.205
Did you get home safe?

01:00:05.207 --> 01:00:07.841
Cannot believe I trusted you!

01:00:07.843 --> 01:00:09.010
I explicitly told you,

01:00:09.012 --> 01:00:10.544
- do not touch the drone!
- Uh-huh.

01:00:10.546 --> 01:00:13.046
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

01:00:13.048 --> 01:00:14.782
Dad?

01:00:14.784 --> 01:00:17.852
Dad, please...
say "I love you" back.

01:00:17.854 --> 01:00:19.490
I need to hear it.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.593
Hello?

01:00:25.961 --> 01:00:27.727
My dad said that I'm grounded.

01:00:27.729 --> 01:00:30.564
Now I'm never gonna be able
to kiss Brixlee.

01:00:30.566 --> 01:00:32.966
It's okay, Max.
There'll be other parties.

01:00:32.968 --> 01:00:35.669
- Lucas, you don't get it.
- He's right, Lucas.

01:00:35.671 --> 01:00:37.137
This party could
change our lives,

01:00:37.139 --> 01:00:38.673
and you don't even care.

01:00:38.675 --> 01:00:40.173
It's not cool at all.

01:00:40.175 --> 01:00:41.975
Yeah, you would know
what's not cool.

01:00:41.977 --> 01:00:43.577
What the fuck does that mean?

01:00:43.579 --> 01:00:45.512
Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup.

01:00:45.514 --> 01:00:48.515
I love beer, so yes, I will.

01:00:48.517 --> 01:00:50.952
And you may think you're
so mature, but the truth is

01:00:50.954 --> 01:00:53.187
you don't have pubes,
and I have six.

01:00:53.189 --> 01:00:55.890
You say you have pubes,
but you also say

01:00:55.892 --> 01:00:57.524
you drink beer,
and I know you don't.

01:00:57.526 --> 01:01:00.794
- Stop arguing!
- Just admit you skipped the audition

01:01:00.796 --> 01:01:01.995
because you thought
it wasn't cool

01:01:01.997 --> 01:01:03.631
even though your voice
is a fucking gift.

01:01:03.633 --> 01:01:06.767
And you always talk a big game,
and you never back it up.

01:01:06.769 --> 01:01:09.035
- Like on the freeway.
- Oh, sorry.

01:01:09.037 --> 01:01:10.271
I didn't want to cross
12 lanes of traffic

01:01:10.273 --> 01:01:13.106
so you can kiss some skank.

01:01:13.108 --> 01:01:14.975
- Oh, shit.
- She's not a skank.

01:01:14.977 --> 01:01:16.943
She's the love of my life.
You take that back!

01:01:16.945 --> 01:01:18.678
Hey, no karate.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.648
Stop fighting!

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.050
You should never
call a woman a skank.

01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:25.952
You should never call
a woman anything.

01:01:25.954 --> 01:01:28.055
And you...

01:01:28.057 --> 01:01:31.024
You made us ditch school,
run around with drugs,

01:01:31.026 --> 01:01:33.794
and lock a cop
in a convenience store

01:01:33.796 --> 01:01:36.296
with what I now suspect
is a dildo!

01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:40.667
What the fuck are you
looking at, Gandalf?!

01:01:40.669 --> 01:01:43.537
You guys don't understand shit.

01:01:43.539 --> 01:01:45.273
I have hormones
flowing through my body,

01:01:45.275 --> 01:01:46.941
making me do crazy things.

01:01:46.943 --> 01:01:49.544
Do you even know
what it feels like

01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:52.146
to want to rub up
against a tree all the time?

01:01:52.148 --> 01:01:53.280
You think
you're better than us.

01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:55.615
Not better, just more mature.

01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:57.684
I'm into romance
and grown-up shit,

01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:59.921
and you guys are still
into little kid stuff.

01:01:59.923 --> 01:02:01.789
I don't even know
why we're still friends.

01:02:29.017 --> 01:02:32.753
Everything you like
is now canceled.

01:02:32.755 --> 01:02:35.990
Birthdays are canceled.
Holidays are canceled.

01:02:35.992 --> 01:02:38.191
Summers, canceled.

01:02:38.193 --> 01:02:39.827
Winter is coming.

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:41.662
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, no, no.

01:02:41.664 --> 01:02:43.965
You are no longer allowed
to call me Daddy.

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:47.233
Call me Andrew
or Mr. Newman or Warden.

01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:50.972
Underneath that cherubic face,
Devil lives inside you.

01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:56.276
I will always love you
because you are my son,

01:02:56.278 --> 01:02:58.314
but I no longer like you.

01:03:05.188 --> 01:03:09.293
Thorny. I just got off
the phone with Max's mom.

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:12.126
Did you know he skipped school

01:03:12.128 --> 01:03:13.628
and biked to the mall
by himself?

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.129
- He said that?
- He did.

01:03:15.131 --> 01:03:16.830
Promise me
you'll never do something

01:03:16.832 --> 01:03:19.066
as stupid as that, okay?

01:03:19.068 --> 01:03:20.704
I-I promise.

01:03:24.307 --> 01:03:26.039
And then
we ran across the highway,

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:27.774
my arm got ripped out,

01:03:27.776 --> 01:03:30.176
and a fake woman
shot out of a car.

01:03:30.178 --> 01:03:32.213
But we still got the drugs.

01:03:32.215 --> 01:03:33.881
But then we traded
the drone for it,

01:03:33.883 --> 01:03:35.349
and-and Max destroyed
his house with it.

01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:38.218
But it was only because
he wanted to marry Brixlee,

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.854
and now he can't
because he's grounded for life.

01:03:40.856 --> 01:03:42.222
And we got into a huge fight,

01:03:42.224 --> 01:03:43.758
and the Bean Bag Boys
are broke up, and...

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.392
- Am I in trouble?
- Okay, son.

01:03:45.394 --> 01:03:48.294
Now, look, I love a good story
with a bunch of gibberish

01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:49.997
just as much as anybody, okay?

01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:51.966
And I know you're going through
a stressful time.

01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:54.267
But it doesn't give you
a reason to tell us fibs.

01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:55.870
I'm not fibbing.

01:03:55.872 --> 01:03:58.104
I'm 100% sure
you're fibbing to me.

01:03:58.106 --> 01:04:00.207
- I'm not fibbing.
- Okay. I think I understand

01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:01.709
what's happening here.

01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:03.711
You think you're losing us,

01:04:03.713 --> 01:04:06.213
and now you're worried you're
gonna lose your friends, too.

01:04:06.215 --> 01:04:07.981
Look at me, man.

01:04:07.983 --> 01:04:09.816
We'll always be there, right?
I mean, and look,

01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:10.617
don't get me wrong.

01:04:10.619 --> 01:04:12.119
You know,
me and your mom are not

01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:13.720
the same people we were
when we first met.

01:04:13.722 --> 01:04:14.921
Mm-hmm.

01:04:14.923 --> 01:04:16.256
Tend to grow apart sometimes.

01:04:16.258 --> 01:04:17.925
But-but it's okay.

01:04:17.927 --> 01:04:19.225
You remember your hermit crab?

01:04:19.227 --> 01:04:21.829
- Herman? Yeah.
- That's right. Herman.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:24.465
- And you remember why he died?
- Oh, son of a...

01:04:24.467 --> 01:04:26.399
You told me he ran away!

01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:29.070
Technically, yes,
he ran away, but then he died.

01:04:29.072 --> 01:04:30.370
Oh, my gosh. How?

01:04:30.372 --> 01:04:33.039
Herman died
because hermit crabs

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:35.776
grow out of their shells,
and they need to find

01:04:35.778 --> 01:04:37.745
new, bigger seashells
on the beach

01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:40.314
to grow into, or they die,
and we didn't know that.

01:04:40.316 --> 01:04:43.483
So, Herman died
because of you guys?

01:04:43.485 --> 01:04:45.119
The point is...

01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:47.220
you and your friends
are growing and changing,

01:04:47.222 --> 01:04:49.189
and y'all need to find
bigger shells.

01:04:49.191 --> 01:04:51.225
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

01:04:51.227 --> 01:04:53.359
Okay, look, you need to blame

01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:55.829
those pet store owners, okay,
because they did not give us

01:04:55.831 --> 01:04:58.134
the information
about hermit crabs...

01:05:12.081 --> 01:05:14.749
It's Lucas.

01:05:14.751 --> 01:05:16.483
You scared the shit out of me.

01:05:16.485 --> 01:05:19.887
I didn't want
your parents to see my face.

01:05:19.889 --> 01:05:21.888
Why are you even here?

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.890
I've grown a lot
in the last two hours.

01:05:23.892 --> 01:05:25.526
My parents' divorce
has really changed me.

01:05:25.528 --> 01:05:27.294
If the Bean Bag Boys
don't grow together,

01:05:27.296 --> 01:05:29.095
they'll grow apart.

01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:30.830
I don't want that.

01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:33.399
I don't want to get
a divorce from you.

01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:35.535
Then you need to go
to Soren's party.

01:05:35.537 --> 01:05:38.338
- You need to sneak out.
- I can't. I'm grounded.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.975
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.

01:05:40.977 --> 01:05:43.343
Let me worry about
the necklace.

01:05:43.345 --> 01:05:45.347
And what are your parents
gonna do, double-ground you?

01:05:46.948 --> 01:05:49.251
Is Brixlee your forever or not?

01:05:50.986 --> 01:05:53.086
Then you need to come
with me now.

01:05:53.088 --> 01:05:56.256
Fine, I'll go, but I'm not
apologizing to Thor.

01:05:56.258 --> 01:05:59.225
- He's not coming.
- Good.

01:05:59.227 --> 01:06:01.227
Fuck that bitch.

01:06:01.229 --> 01:06:03.530
I'll go get my jacket.

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:05.999
- Hey, Max.
- Yeah?

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:07.837
Bring that dick.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:16.910
You said Thor wasn't coming.

01:06:16.912 --> 01:06:18.245
What the hell is he doing here?

01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:19.280
I Parent-Trapped your asses.

01:06:19.282 --> 01:06:20.548
See, now we're all in

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.419
a bigger hermit crab shell
together.

01:06:24.052 --> 01:06:25.852
It made sense
when my parents said it.

01:06:25.854 --> 01:06:27.854
So, you took the blame
for us, huh?

01:06:27.856 --> 01:06:29.356
Yeah. I thought about

01:06:29.358 --> 01:06:31.392
what you would do,
and did the opposite.

01:06:31.394 --> 01:06:34.894
This party, it's gonna be
an epic rager.

01:06:34.896 --> 01:06:36.396
Okay, Sippy Cup.

01:06:36.398 --> 01:06:39.001
Just stay out of my way,
Maxi Pad.

01:06:49.211 --> 01:06:52.379
Aw, don't you boys look cute.

01:06:52.381 --> 01:06:54.381
Everybody's in the basement.

01:06:54.383 --> 01:06:56.850
I don't even want to know
what's going on down there.

01:06:56.852 --> 01:06:58.519
Come on in, fellas.

01:06:58.521 --> 01:07:00.387
Hi.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:01.988

01:07:28.584 --> 01:07:31.184
Hi. I'm Max.

01:07:31.186 --> 01:07:33.320
Hi.

01:07:33.322 --> 01:07:35.455
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:07:35.457 --> 01:07:36.923
You, too.

01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:38.626
Cool jacket.

01:07:38.628 --> 01:07:40.327
Thank you.

01:07:40.329 --> 01:07:43.430
I got it all by myself,
with my mom.

01:07:43.432 --> 01:07:46.200
I go shopping with my mom, too.

01:07:46.202 --> 01:07:48.371
This is going so well.

01:07:50.206 --> 01:07:52.075
Did you bring the necklace?

01:07:53.976 --> 01:07:56.075
Brixlee, this is for you.

01:07:56.077 --> 01:07:58.945
Oh, thanks. It's pretty.

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:00.113
They're an-al.

01:08:00.115 --> 01:08:01.414
Ooh, fancy.

01:08:04.486 --> 01:08:06.986
I'm gonna wear this later.

01:08:06.988 --> 01:08:08.454
Thanks, Max.

01:08:08.456 --> 01:08:11.057
What's up, Sippy Cup?

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:12.959
Not much.

01:08:12.961 --> 01:08:14.561
Just, uh, got into a fight

01:08:14.563 --> 01:08:18.131
with a bunch of men
and, uh, stole a beer.

01:08:18.134 --> 01:08:21.167
There's no way Sippy Cup
is gonna drink it.

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.502
Not only am I gonna drink it,

01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:26.205
I'm gonna break the record.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:29.475
I'm gonna take four sips.

01:08:29.478 --> 01:08:31.109
Four is impossible.

01:08:31.112 --> 01:08:33.379
- Soren can't even do four.
- Shut up.

01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:35.919
Drink.

01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:54.267
That's one.

01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:56.473
Big deal.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.609
That's two.

01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:04.014
Mm-kay.

01:09:08.718 --> 01:09:10.283
That's three!

01:09:10.286 --> 01:09:12.086
This is insane.

01:09:13.321 --> 01:09:14.488
He's gonna barf.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.288
Somebody get him a sippy cup.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:19.193
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

01:09:19.194 --> 01:09:22.694
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup!

01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:25.631
Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

01:09:25.634 --> 01:09:27.767
Sippy Cup! Sippy...

01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:29.770
That's fucking four!

01:09:29.772 --> 01:09:31.738
Oh, fuck!

01:09:31.741 --> 01:09:33.474
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

01:09:33.475 --> 01:09:35.441
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor!

01:09:35.443 --> 01:09:37.711
I'm a fucking alcoholic!

01:09:40.415 --> 01:09:41.648
No way!

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:43.617
Four sips. Badass.

01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:44.752
Mad respect to Thor.

01:09:44.754 --> 01:09:46.587
Eyes up here.

01:09:46.589 --> 01:09:49.488
If you don't consent
to kissing, that's cool.

01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:51.557
You can go play VR upstairs.

01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:53.158
But if you're staying
down here,

01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:54.595
you better strap in,

01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:56.430
because shit's about
to get real.

01:09:56.432 --> 01:09:58.065
- Hell yeah.
- Okay.

01:09:58.067 --> 01:09:59.466
Let's spin a bottle.

01:09:59.468 --> 01:10:02.703
Well, then it's a good thing
I got a bottle right here!

01:10:05.674 --> 01:10:10.177

01:10:10.179 --> 01:10:14.414

I'm out.

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.699
- Wait, where are you going?
- That was nasty.

01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:36.369
I'm going upstairs to play VR.

01:10:36.371 --> 01:10:38.638
If you leave,
you can never come back.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.478
Oh, no.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.418
Brixlee...

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.418
your turn.

01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:03.465
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:32.327
Oh, my God. This is the most
dramatic thing I've ever seen.

01:11:34.897 --> 01:11:36.800
He's not gonna do it.

01:11:38.601 --> 01:11:39.669
He's gonna do it.

01:11:41.336 --> 01:11:43.669
I can't do it.

01:11:45.273 --> 01:11:47.708
People don't change.
He's still Sippy Cup.

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.575
Wait, wait.

01:11:49.577 --> 01:11:50.843
Kissy Cup.

01:11:50.845 --> 01:11:52.279
Kissy Cup!

01:11:52.281 --> 01:11:54.448
Kissy Cup! Kissy Cup!

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:55.916
Kissy Cup! Kissy...

01:11:55.918 --> 01:11:58.217
Fuck off, Atticus!
His name is Thor.

01:11:58.219 --> 01:12:00.520
And everyone knows your mom
plagiarized her cookbook.

01:12:00.522 --> 01:12:02.491
Thor, wait up.

01:12:07.897 --> 01:12:10.596
I'm sorry I called you
a try-hard.

01:12:10.598 --> 01:12:12.932
Nah, you were right.

01:12:12.934 --> 01:12:14.668
This whole time,
I've been trying

01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.306
to be someone who I wasn't.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.573
I got an earring.

01:12:19.575 --> 01:12:21.708
I drank a beer.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:23.776
I quit singing.

01:12:23.778 --> 01:12:25.546
Yeah.

01:12:25.548 --> 01:12:27.914
I guess I went
a little crazy today, too.

01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:33.553
Let's get out of here.

01:12:33.555 --> 01:12:36.657
No.
You don't want to do that.

01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:39.525
You're gonna stay down here
and kiss Brixlee.

01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:43.198
The Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

01:12:44.265 --> 01:12:45.766
Not everything.

01:12:45.768 --> 01:12:47.637
Not anymore.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.907
Maybe those old girls
were right.

01:12:53.909 --> 01:12:56.443
Maybe we're on
different paths.

01:12:56.445 --> 01:12:59.312
Yeah.

01:12:59.314 --> 01:13:00.782
Then what are you gonna do?

01:13:02.483 --> 01:13:05.351
I don't know.
I just know it's not this.

01:13:05.353 --> 01:13:07.320
No way.

01:13:07.322 --> 01:13:08.454
This is insane.

01:13:08.456 --> 01:13:10.257
Forget spin the bottle.

01:13:10.259 --> 01:13:13.596
Now, go over there
and kiss your future wife.

01:13:15.397 --> 01:13:18.231
Bye.

01:13:18.233 --> 01:13:20.236
Bye.

01:13:46.762 --> 01:13:49.933
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

01:13:51.433 --> 01:13:52.769
Okay.

01:14:21.729 --> 01:14:24.030
Cool.

01:14:24.032 --> 01:14:25.899
Where am I?

01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:27.668
Oh, here I am.

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.069
Lucas, I'm leaving.

01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:31.937
You sure you don't want
to try this?

01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:33.610
Nah, I'm good.

01:14:38.379 --> 01:14:40.047
Want to go to my house
and play Ascension?

01:14:40.049 --> 01:14:42.952
I don't want to play
Ascension anymore.

01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:46.052
Then who am I gonna play with?

01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:47.721
You'll find someone.

01:14:49.825 --> 01:14:50.990
My face feels so tingly.

01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:52.859
No way.

01:14:52.861 --> 01:14:55.061
Oh, my God.
This is amazing!

01:14:55.063 --> 01:14:57.631
I can't believe
you guys are here.

01:14:57.633 --> 01:14:59.632
Oh, this is so amazing.

01:14:59.634 --> 01:15:03.002
- Hi. - Oh, hi.
- Sit down.

01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:04.604
Please no, please no.
Don't kill us.

01:15:04.606 --> 01:15:05.838
Look what happened.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.908
How do you know Soren?

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:10.510
Is he your boyfriend?

01:15:10.512 --> 01:15:13.713
He's my brother.
I love that piece of shit.

01:15:19.655 --> 01:15:21.754
You guys,
where's everybody else?

01:15:21.756 --> 01:15:24.056
Where's your friend
with the sad eyes?

01:15:24.058 --> 01:15:26.525
- Sad boy Max.
- In the basement kissing.

01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:28.395
It's an orgy down there.

01:15:28.397 --> 01:15:29.796
And you guys aren't into that?

01:15:29.798 --> 01:15:31.765
- Mm-mm.
- Aw, it's okay.

01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:32.998
You're only in sixth grade.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.435
You guys are gonna
figure it out.

01:15:35.437 --> 01:15:37.738
- Yeah, you have your whole life for that. No rush.
- Yeah.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.771
- No rush.
- No rush.

01:15:38.773 --> 01:15:41.440
I mean, what do you love?

01:15:41.442 --> 01:15:45.878
Ascension, rules,
antidrug campaigns...

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.681
grilled cheese.

01:15:47.683 --> 01:15:49.548
- Mmm.
- Oh, I could fuck with a grilled cheese right now.

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:50.784
- Aw...
- Guys, I'm gonna make us grilled cheese.

01:15:50.786 --> 01:15:52.953
- Oh, yeah. That sounds so good.
- Nice.

01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:55.154
What about you, sleeveless?
What are you into?

01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:57.591
I love to sing.

01:15:57.593 --> 01:15:58.958
Yes.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.694
I actually skipped

01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:02.462
my audition today
for the musical.

01:16:02.464 --> 01:16:04.431
- No.
- Now I can't be in it.

01:16:04.433 --> 01:16:05.998
- No.
- What? You have to

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.700
convince them
to let you audition.

01:16:07.702 --> 01:16:09.636
You must. You must.

01:16:09.638 --> 01:16:10.703
- Audition.
- Shh. Sing for us.

01:16:10.705 --> 01:16:11.504
- No.
- Oh, my God.

01:16:11.506 --> 01:16:12.939
Sing for us.
You're a baby bird.

01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:13.907
No, come on.
We missed our concert.

01:16:13.909 --> 01:16:16.142
- Sing for us.
- So, no grilled cheese?

01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:17.543
- Sing for us. Sing for us.
- No.

01:16:17.545 --> 01:16:18.548

one of your shows.

Thank you.

Oh, sorry.
Thor, this is Scout.

01:20:29.363 --> 01:20:31.664
- You were really good.
- Thanks, sweetie.

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:33.302
I was much better
in the matinee.

01:20:34.702 --> 01:20:36.772

still grounded.

It ended yesterday.
A month in the hole.

01:20:42.911 --> 01:20:45.278
Thanks again
for taking the fall.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.180
You would've done the same.

01:20:47.182 --> 01:20:49.248
Well, well, well.

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.850
Look who's here. Me.

01:20:50.852 --> 01:20:53.352
Hey!

01:20:53.354 --> 01:20:55.691
Feels like we haven't
talked in weeks.

01:20:57.259 --> 01:20:58.925
Yeah.

01:20:58.927 --> 01:21:00.092
Max.

01:21:00.094 --> 01:21:02.328
My mom said she'll drop us
at frozen yogurt

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.064
if your mom will pick us up.

01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:05.765
Great.
Be there in a second, babe.

01:21:05.767 --> 01:21:07.100
Okay, babe.

01:21:07.102 --> 01:21:09.302
So, how's it going with Scout?

01:21:09.304 --> 01:21:10.436
Good.

01:21:10.438 --> 01:21:12.337
But hard. But good.

01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:14.740
A relationship is
a lot of work.

01:21:14.742 --> 01:21:16.379
Don't let anyone
tell you differently.

01:21:18.013 --> 01:21:19.479
Hey.
Uh, Lucas, you still want

01:21:19.481 --> 01:21:21.715
to play Ascension
with me and the guys later?

01:21:21.717 --> 01:21:24.687
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Classic Lucas.

01:21:25.987 --> 01:21:28.354
Carlos and those SCAB guys
seem cool.

01:21:28.356 --> 01:21:30.457
They're cool.

01:21:30.459 --> 01:21:32.995
But they're not
the Bean Bag Boys.

01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:37.165
Max.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.870
All right.

01:21:43.304 --> 01:21:45.971
I guess, I guess I should go.

01:21:45.973 --> 01:21:47.873
Yeah, all right.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.876
Well...

01:21:49.878 --> 01:21:51.511
Yeah.

01:22:06.827 --> 01:22:09.098
I missed you guys.

01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:19.404
Let's make a promise.

01:22:19.406 --> 01:22:21.775
Even if we don't hang out
all the time,

01:22:21.777 --> 01:22:23.943
we'll still always be there
for the big stuff.

01:22:23.945 --> 01:22:26.182
Bean Bag Boys for life.

01:22:27.249 --> 01:22:29.149
Bean Bag Boys for life.

01:22:29.151 --> 01:22:31.253

01:22:41.495 --> 01:22:42.864

01:22:45.166 --> 01:22:46.900

I have to show you.

01:22:58.879 --> 01:22:59.878

01:23:04.853 --> 01:23:06.586
Your parents love to play.

01:23:06.588 --> 01:23:09.955

- They swing on it.

01:23:09.957 --> 01:23:11.557
