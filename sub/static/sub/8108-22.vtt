House.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.939
I know you're not asleep.

02:26.064 --> 02:28.691
That insight would be
a lot more impressive

02:29.108 --> 02:32.695
if you weren't just a product
of my exhausted brain.

02:33.238 --> 02:35.990
Aren't you curious
about why I'm here?

02:40.036 --> 02:44.457
Curious why no French maid's outfit,
no spanky pants...

02:44.999 --> 02:47.836
I'm a hallucination,
not a fantasy.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.341
It's insomnia. Four nights
without REM sleep can cause...

02:53.466 --> 02:55.552
That might explain why
you're hallucinating,

02:55.677 --> 02:59.305
doesn't explain why you're hallucinating
Wilson's dead girlfriend.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.725
Probably because of my secret
and very unconscious desire

03:02.851 --> 03:03.810
to get Wilson
into my bedroom.

03:03.935 --> 03:05.478
Or maybe your guilt
over Kutner's suicide

you felt about me.

Deaf 14-year-old started

04:00.617 --> 04:03.369

are insomnia, which he doesn't have,

04:03.494 --> 04:04.787

he doesn't get,

Could have just looked like
a bad shot to the leg.

his head blows up all over again.

I'll take that as
a "Congratulations."

We're discussing a case.

04:59.050 --> 05:01.302
Why did he close
that file?

Wedding in two weeks?
I'd say you were pregnant,

05:05.306 --> 05:08.643
but I don't think Chase's body
is mature enough to produce sperm.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.687
It's a small ceremony,
why wait?

05:12.647 --> 05:13.773

Chase's best man doesn't
get here till the day of the wedding,

05:38.840 --> 05:41.592
so I asked Wilson to
throw his bachelor party.

05:41.718 --> 05:43.886
No retired ministers
available to plan it?

05:44.012 --> 05:46.639
Chase doesn't want
some big, raucous party.

05:46.764 --> 05:47.849
So she says.

05:47.974 --> 05:51.978
Luckily, there are people in this world
ready to stand up for what's right.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.896
No, no, no.
I don't want you to...

05:54.022 --> 05:59.569
Listen, of the two things I do well,
bachelor parties rank towards the top.

06:09.287 --> 06:10.913
Starting five hertz.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.792
House made it through
that entire differential

06:14.917 --> 06:18.296
without mocking our patient
for not having a cochlear implant.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.091
The patient doesn't want an implant
because he's comfortable with who he is.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.718
It's admirable.

06:23.843 --> 06:26.929
He's deaf, that's not an identity,
it's a disability.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.181
It's also a culture.

06:28.306 --> 06:31.559
The deaf have their own schools,
their own language.

06:31.684 --> 06:32.977

FOREMAN: Going to 20.

06:35.438 --> 06:39.734
Anything I can simulate with a $3 pair
of ear plugs is not a culture.

No sign of seizure.
Temporal lobe activity is still clean.

One of his eyes.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.704
"The limp leading the blind."

06:52.538 --> 06:54.582
Is that supposed
to mean something?

06:55.750 --> 06:57.418
I didn't think so.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.379
So, exploding head syndrome
plus vision loss.

07:00.505 --> 07:02.757
Subclavian steal syndrome.
Vascular defect

07:02.882 --> 07:05.843
coupled with constant arm movement could
siphon blood flow from the brain.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.095
THIRTEEN: We should do
an angio, check his...

07:07.220 --> 07:08.930

07:17.480 --> 07:20.108
How did I know he
was gonna go blind?

07:21.734 --> 07:25.363
Don't get cute, Gazoo. You're
in my mind, you're obviously there.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.281
AMBER: C-reactive protein.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.535
I noticed in his file
it was slightly elevated.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.122
I figured the stress of the seizure lab
would drive the inflammation even higher

07:34.247 --> 07:36.624
and lead to optic neuritis.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.168
That's a lot clearer
than "the limp leading the blind."

07:39.293 --> 07:41.963
It was just a glimmer.
I couldn't put it into words.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.756
It was a long shot.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.176
I don't even remember
the C-reactive protein level.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.221
Obviously you do,
you just don't know it.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.599
How high is K2?

07:53.724 --> 07:55.017
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

07:55.143 --> 07:57.603

Go play the kid some music.

08:12.785 --> 08:13.786

the vibrations in his abdomen,

09:15.473 --> 09:17.225
but not his hand.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.601
What does that mean?

09:22.939 --> 09:26.609
It's a new symptom.
Neuropathy.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.871
Thought you were
gonna get some sleep.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.165
The case got interesting.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.887
It's like the zoo.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.515
Except you can
bang on the glass as much as you want.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.100
How'd you know about
the neuropathy?

09:59.225 --> 10:00.351
Good question.

10:00.476 --> 10:01.811
Enough with the riddles.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.105
Tell me about it.

10:04.814 --> 10:06.816
Think wrestling record.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.235
Juggling.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.447
No, pins, three pins.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.158
Patient was pinned
in his last three matches.

10:16.284 --> 10:17.785
Leading up
to that he was 15-and-0.

10:17.910 --> 10:21.247
I figured his balance was off
from diminished sensation.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.666
Could be increased ICP
from a brain tumor.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.543
That we missed
on the head CT?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.838
Cutting weight for wrestling
could've led to rhabdomyolysis.

10:28.963 --> 10:32.008
Patient went up a weight class
three months ago.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.926
Foreman's right.

10:35.803 --> 10:39.849
Actually, increased
ICP could make sense.

10:39.974 --> 10:40.933
FOREMAN: You just said...

10:41.058 --> 10:42.476
I was processing.

10:47.732 --> 10:50.276
It also puts a new
symptom on the table.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.278
His deafness.

10:52.987 --> 10:57.074
What if it was caused by NF2 cancer,
instead of his childhood meningitis?

10:57.199 --> 10:58.868
So, meningitis was
a coincidence.

10:58.993 --> 11:02.455
Or a by-product of the cancer
suppressing his immune system.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.414
MRI his head.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.542
If you're right about
NF2, his deafness may be reversible.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.835
I'll set it up
and talk to the patient.

11:28.481 --> 11:30.775
It was on House's
list of requirements.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.735
I have three theories.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.697
Why is House so into
this bachelor party?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.699
He needs to have a reason
to be into a bachelor party?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.910
He needs a reason
to be into anything.

11:41.035 --> 11:42.745
Give me your wallet.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.626
House could be trying to tempt Chase
into cheating, break them up.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.960
You think House
is into Cameron?

11:50.086 --> 11:52.588
I think House is into
Cameron being into him.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.633
Marrying Chase would
shatter that fantasy.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.969
If Chase cheats, they shouldn't be
getting married in the first place.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.973
So, you're okay with House getting Chase
smashed enough to make a stupid mistake?

12:03.099 --> 12:05.684
Being drunk doesn't change who you are,
it just reveals it.

12:10.815 --> 12:13.275
You think she can
do the Broken Cowboy?

12:13.401 --> 12:14.693
God, I hope so.

12:14.819 --> 12:19.240
NF2 is an extremely slow-growing cancer,
which makes it very treatable.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.034
If we're right, taking out the tumor

12:22.159 --> 12:25.204
means there's a chance
you'll regain your hearing.

12:30.376 --> 12:33.295
No, they said you have to.

12:34.964 --> 12:36.715
What's wrong?

12:36.841 --> 12:39.760
He wants you to treat the cancer,
but leave him deaf.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.097
Sorry. It doesn't
work like that.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.685
But why?

12:47.810 --> 12:48.769
I don't know.

13:12.209 --> 13:16.881
Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP,
but no masses on or around the nerves.

13:17.006 --> 13:18.757
It's not cancer.

13:18.883 --> 13:22.386
Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth
ventricle, could still indicate a tumor.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.762
We brought pictures.

13:23.888 --> 13:26.098
The fact that you sent me
on a scouting mission...

13:26.223 --> 13:27.725
No skirts.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.143
You're not on the guest list.

13:29.894 --> 13:33.230
Bachelor parties are an ancient and
sacred male rite of passage.

13:33.355 --> 13:36.984
The ventricle bowing is most likely
a pre-existing anatomical anomaly,

13:37.109 --> 13:39.111
not the indication
of a tumor.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.946
No way to know for sure
without a brain biopsy.

13:41.071 --> 13:41.989
If I get drunk enough,

13:42.114 --> 13:44.658
there's a chance I might make out
with one of the strippers.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.202
Or become one.

13:46.785 --> 13:47.828
- Sold.
- Sold.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.790
We can't just drill
into our patient's brain on a hunch.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.167
- God, not her.
- God, not her.

13:54.919 --> 13:56.795
She's the one that got me
hooked in with Madoff.

13:56.921 --> 13:58.380
Taub's right.
It's not cancer.

13:58.506 --> 13:59.507
HOUSE: Yeah, by all means,

13:59.632 --> 14:03.052
abandon a great diagnostic
theory because it's difficult to prove.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.639
Do a biopsy. We need to take a better
look at his fourth ventricle.

14:06.764 --> 14:07.723
Or an older look.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.809
The mom is never gonna let us touch
his brain without some evidence.

Hospital could've done an MRI.

14:16.524 --> 14:17.775
Okay-

14:21.862 --> 14:23.697
The main reason my third wife
and I eloped

14:23.822 --> 14:26.784
was to avoid House's bachelor party.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.790
Have you seen Caligula?

14:32.915 --> 14:33.749
(DOOR OPENING)

14:36.085 --> 14:42.758
My patient's brain now versus three
years ago. See any difference?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.595
Is he telling you
to avoid the party?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.514
I took an oath
to do no harm.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.140
Sure, don't come,

14:50.558 --> 14:53.644
if you want your wedding
vows to be meaningless.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.730
This should be interesting.

14:56.981 --> 15:00.776
You are going to commit
to that one special woman forever,

15:00.901 --> 15:02.236
which is beautiful.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.280
But if your commitment
the day after the wedding

15:04.405 --> 15:05.864
is the same as
your commitment the day before,

15:05.990 --> 15:07.783
then the wedding
meant nothing.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.661
So, and I see
no logical way around this,

15:10.786 --> 15:12.788
if you want your marriage to matter,

15:12.913 --> 15:16.834
you have to be a wanton, trolling,
muck-covered pig the day before.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.878
You're evil. See you.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.214
The wall of the fourth ventricle
changed,

15:22.339 --> 15:24.466
it isn't
bowed in the older scan.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.594
Evidence of NF2, right?

15:27.219 --> 15:30.097
You'd need to do
a brain biopsy to confirm.

15:35.019 --> 15:37.438
I'm not going
to the bachelor party.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.607
Every time I go to
one of your parties,

15:39.732 --> 15:44.111
I end up embarrassing
myself in some new and unexpected way.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.740
That whole thing with the duck
was hardly unexpected.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.700
I'm not going.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.826
Okay-

15:50.951 --> 15:51.952
It's not okay.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.628
AMBER: Do you know
who we need?

16:00.753 --> 16:02.963
That stripper you got for
Wilson's bachelor party.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.466
You could do body shots
right off her.

16:05.591 --> 16:08.886
Why go back to that well?
In the nine years since Wilson's party,

16:09.011 --> 16:12.806
a whole new generation of hot girls
have been abused by their stepfathers.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.767
She loved cats.

16:15.643 --> 16:18.812
Why would you remember
that a stripper loved cats?

16:19.271 --> 16:22.191
Chase has a cat,
they'll bond.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.654
House, you entertaining
yourself up there?

16:29.698 --> 16:33.243
Just rehearsing for the
revival of Evita. What did you find?

16:33.369 --> 16:35.287
Biopsy shows nerve
inflammation consistent

16:35.412 --> 16:37.790
with increased
intracranial pressure.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.000
Something's wrong,
but it's not cancer.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.673
He's gonna go
through life deaf.

16:45.798 --> 16:46.882
He's okay with that.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.510
He has no idea
what he's missing.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.053
His mom's a moron.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.431
He's gonna pay for her stupidity
for the rest of his life?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.975
Are we okay with that?

17:03.148 --> 17:06.985
Why are you closing? You're supposed
to put in a cochlear implant.

17:07.111 --> 17:08.487
That wasn't in the paperwork.

17:08.612 --> 17:12.491
Really? Well, someone must have
screwed up. I'll go track it down.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.952
- <i>I'll wait.
-That's a great idea.</i>

17:15.077 --> 17:18.956
Let the kid spend more timeunder
anesthesia with his skull cracked open.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.499
I'll wait.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.128
I've been known to lie
to serve my own agenda.

17:24.253 --> 17:28.006
An implant does absolutely
nothing to help me diagnose him.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.845
Let's get an implant
tray in here.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.941
(HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK)

17:49.903 --> 17:51.488
(CLOCK TICKING)

17:52.406 --> 17:53.866
(WATER DRIPPING)

17:54.241 --> 17:55.909
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

17:58.537 --> 17:59.913
(PHONE RINGING)

18:00.038 --> 18:01.957
Just try to relax.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.011
Her son didn't
want the implant.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.431
If he still doesn't want it, after
having time to adjust, I'll take it out.

18:17.556 --> 18:20.017
I'll blind him, too, if he wants
to experience that culture.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.477
Remove it now.

18:21.769 --> 18:24.480
Kid just had brain surgery.
He's not stable.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.359
Ms. Miller, I'm not trying to minimize
Dr. House's wrongdoing,

18:29.485 --> 18:30.486
but the best thing
for your son...

18:30.611 --> 18:31.737
Why is she sitting?

18:31.862 --> 18:36.909
She's not yelling, not threatening,
not pacing, just sitting.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.870
CUDDY: Understand,
Dr. House?

18:40.913 --> 18:43.290
House, focus.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.251
I need you to say you
accept the arrangement.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.004
No problem. You're not mad.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.800
I'm mad.

18:52.925 --> 18:53.759
Not mad enough.

18:54.843 --> 18:55.928
You wanted your son to hear.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.722
You just didn't have the guts
to make him get the implant.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.851
Once my son is stable,
I want that thing out of his head.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.778
Why did you do this?

19:12.903 --> 19:16.532
Because he is ignorant
and he's being raised by an idiot.

19:16.657 --> 19:19.618
Not good enough,
you always have...

19:19.743 --> 19:22.621
My patient is opting
into a handicap.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.458
He's an insult to all
the other gimps out there.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.253
Okay-

19:31.380 --> 19:33.757
But I'm still putting Foreman
in charge of the case.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.551
That's the arrangement?

19:38.762 --> 19:39.888
Okay-

19:46.687 --> 19:49.273
You're okay with
Foreman in charge?

19:50.399 --> 19:51.733
Who you calling?

19:51.859 --> 19:53.861
Oh, right, you don't want
to look like a lunatic.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.821
Yeah, about that.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.573
You think we did
the wrong thing?

19:57.698 --> 20:01.618
I'm not sure. I'm not
even sure why we did it.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.246
That argument you made to Cuddy
sounded pretty good.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.789
To you, maybe.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.925
Huh. I figured by now you'd be at
the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.803
Yeah, you did something stupid.
Quick, better mock someone.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.847
Why did you do it?

20:22.139 --> 20:24.558
Why did I give a human being
the power of hearing?

20:24.683 --> 20:28.312
You can ask God the same question,
he'll give you the same answer.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.689
Patient has a fever now, too.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.358
Probably just a post-op
complication. Arnold-Chiari?

20:33.483 --> 20:34.735
Not without muscle weakness.

20:34.860 --> 20:35.903
Pseudotumor Cerebri?

20:36.028 --> 20:38.363
We checked his eyes
before the surgery. No papilledema.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.573
AMBER: Candy?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.994
I'm pretty sure Wilson's stripper's
name was something sweet.

20:44.119 --> 20:47.331
TAUB: Maybe his fever is more
than a post-op reaction.

20:47.456 --> 20:48.874
His girlfriend
was sick a few months ago,

20:48.999 --> 20:51.585
- maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr.
- Lolly?

20:51.710 --> 20:54.546
THIRTEEN: They swap spit, virus travels
to his brain, leads to meningitis,

20:54.671 --> 20:56.089
leads to increased
intracranial pressure.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.133
I agree. Taffy?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.384
I agree.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.431
Go ahead, start him on
ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.807
Keep making decisions
like that,

21:05.933 --> 21:09.019
it really bolsters the illusion
that you're in charge.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.733
Why aren't you
in my office?

21:14.942 --> 21:17.778
Because I know what
the word "my" means.

21:17.903 --> 21:22.074
I did something insane, and you're
not all over me analyzing why.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.619
It was nice.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.749
I gave that idiot an implant to prove
to him what an idiot he's been.

21:30.874 --> 21:31.708
How is that nice?

21:31.833 --> 21:34.711
You didn't do it to solve the case,
you didn't do it to save his life,

21:34.836 --> 21:38.090
you did it to make his life better.
It was a caring act.

21:38.215 --> 21:44.304
Which you did in a way that
was immoral and illegal, but baby steps.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.765
Doesn't sound like us.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.018
You can't make me go
to the bachelor party.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.144
I know.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.563
And you're okay with that?

21:53.689 --> 21:55.273
What choice do I have?

22:09.746 --> 22:10.747
Seth!

22:13.542 --> 22:14.960
(SIGHING)
Please, God...

22:21.717 --> 22:22.801
Seth.

22:27.931 --> 22:28.974
Yes.

22:34.730 --> 22:35.897
Seth.

23:02.841 --> 23:03.842
Oh!

23:04.718 --> 23:06.845
I think he just wet the bed.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.570
TAUB: Kid's dehydrated
but stable.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.823
Thankfully the fountain of whizz
seems to have stopped for the moment.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.119
Not before hosing
Epstein-Barr off the table.

23:31.328 --> 23:32.496
Now, eat up.

23:32.704 --> 23:36.583
We're gonna pick out the ice cream
flavors for the bachelor party.

23:36.833 --> 23:40.921
Could be a systemic
autoimmune disease. Sarcoido...

23:42.464 --> 23:44.466
This tastes like vodka.

23:45.133 --> 23:48.053
Well, it would be stupid if it tasted
like bourbon. That's the brown one.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.262
It is vodka?

23:49.387 --> 23:54.267
Flash frozen in a secret process.
Guy figured it out in his basement.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.773
Limoncello. Genius.

23:59.898 --> 24:04.361
Symptoms came on too hard and too fast.
Sarcoidosis is progressive.

24:06.655 --> 24:09.282
Remember, in med school,
when Donovan gave grand rounds,

24:09.407 --> 24:11.326
there was that guy
who was peeing liters.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.913
Glomerulonephritis. Wrestler, steroids
could have damaged the kidneys.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.624
The scotch is nice.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.292
His urine
would've been brown.

24:19.417 --> 24:23.296
Donovan ruled out osmotic diuresis,
kidney disease...

24:24.172 --> 24:25.048
Pheochromocytoma?

24:25.173 --> 24:27.259
No hypertension, plasma
metanephrine is normal.

24:27.384 --> 24:28.468
Devic's?

24:28.593 --> 24:31.263
It happened at night.
That was the clue.

24:31.471 --> 24:35.767
Night, recumbent body
position, changes in BP...

24:39.604 --> 24:41.022
It's his heart.

24:42.774 --> 24:45.610
Run a 12-lead EKG,
watch him for four hours.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.362
Foreman concurs.

24:51.950 --> 24:56.746
What the hell just happened?
Everything started to fade away.

24:56.872 --> 25:00.792
You're getting better at focusing,
ignoring everything that doesn't matter.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.378
Uh-oh!

25:03.503 --> 25:06.715
He looks pissed.
I think he might hit us.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.801
Is your eyesight
better than mine?

25:09.926 --> 25:12.262
We need to talk about
the bachelor party.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.348
HOUSE: Excellent topic choice.

25:15.473 --> 25:19.561
I mean, surgery is so boring, and my
lying to you is just so yesterday.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.897
It's my fault for letting you
talk me into the implant.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.357
Cameron is not gonna be
happy about this party.

25:24.482 --> 25:25.859
But, you,
on the other hand...

25:25.984 --> 25:28.445
Plan on spending
the rest of my life with Cameron.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.031
So, I need to cancel
the fart band?

25:31.156 --> 25:33.950
So, I need you
to kidnap me.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.871
Spoken like a true Aussie.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.706
By the way, if you know where

25:39.831 --> 25:42.083
I can get the sheet music
to Waltzing Matilda...

25:45.712 --> 25:49.966
Hey! Want some ice cream?
We're having a sundae bar.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.260
Sweet.

25:54.763 --> 25:56.681
AMBER: That's her name!

25:56.806 --> 25:57.974
Sundae or Bar?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.310
Karamel.

26:01.519 --> 26:02.729
With a "K."

26:35.428 --> 26:36.596
Bath room?

26:39.015 --> 26:41.601
Down the hall, two doors,
on your right.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.186
Thanks.

26:46.773 --> 26:51.778
Do I sound like her?

26:55.490 --> 26:56.783
It takes time.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.586
You still haven't slept?

27:09.296 --> 27:10.297
(BURPS)

27:10.797 --> 27:12.340
And then I have
a clever response.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.760
FOREMAN: EKG, normal sinus, normal
intervals. His heart's fine.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.679
His heart's not fine.

27:17.804 --> 27:21.766
The heart was fine during this test.
The arrhythmia's hiding.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.852
Or we were wrong
about the heart.

27:23.977 --> 27:24.978
TAUB: Could be the thyroid.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.939
Hashimoto's would explain
the kid's urine and brain pressure.

27:28.064 --> 27:31.151
- Treadmill.
- Or the arrhythmia is hiding.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.654
We need to stress him.
Put the patient on a treadmill.

27:34.779 --> 27:36.448
The patient just
had brain surgery.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.742
A stress test could cause
a brain bleed and kill him.

27:38.867 --> 27:42.412
I value your opinion.
I value rejecting your opinion.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.873
You're not doing this.
You haven't been sleeping...

27:44.998 --> 27:47.167
Cuddy doesn't actually
want you in charge.

27:47.292 --> 27:51.004
She just wants to avoid
a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.

27:51.129 --> 27:54.632
And if I let you risk our patient's life
testing an organ we already tested,

27:54.758 --> 27:57.218
we accomplish neither.
Run a thyroid panel.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.063
How do we get him into the stress lab
without Foreman's sign off?

28:08.188 --> 28:11.358
We could kill Foreman.
Is she new?

28:12.484 --> 28:17.906
Focus. The lab simulates stress.
What if it's not simulated?

28:18.406 --> 28:20.575
We could tell him his
girlfriend dumped him.

28:20.700 --> 28:24.120
It's a tough sell since she never leaves
the room for more than five minutes.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.914
We could kill her.

28:26.039 --> 28:30.085
Or asthma meds. Force the heart
to beat faster.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.379
Revealing the arrhythmia.

28:33.630 --> 28:34.672
Nice idea.

28:34.798 --> 28:35.757
It was yours.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.387
(SETH SCREAMING)

28:45.308 --> 28:46.810
I just left the room
for a few minutes.

28:46.935 --> 28:50.647
He ripped out his implant.
So much for improving his life.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.316
Actually, I think
we just saved it.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.823
Look at that. Arrhythmia.

29:05.286 --> 29:08.540
You were right about the heart.
I should have listened to you.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.127
The correct phrasing would be,
"I should always listen to you."

29:12.252 --> 29:15.505
He's got problems everywhere.
What goes everywhere?

29:15.964 --> 29:17.674
THIRTEEN: Blood.
Could be thrombocythemia.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.843
Excess platelets lead to
clotting throughout the body.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.177
Not with a normal
platelet count.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.512
So the clotting
doesn't start in the blood,

29:22.637 --> 29:24.347
it starts in
the lungs. Pulmonary embolism.

29:24.472 --> 29:27.559
We should do a VIQ scan,
see if his lungs are clear.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.029
Go.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.752
Are you sure I did this
at Wilson's party?

29:54.878 --> 29:57.839
Last time, you used grain alcohol
instead of the Sambuca.

29:58.256 --> 29:59.424
And it worked?

30:08.766 --> 30:12.061
Well, it explains my lack of eyebrows
by the end of the evening.

30:17.150 --> 30:19.319
By the power
of Grayskull, I...

30:28.578 --> 30:30.121
This is why we're rehearsing.

30:32.624 --> 30:37.128
Ever wonder what's happening every time
our patient gets sicker?

30:37.378 --> 30:38.379
Not right now.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.340
First symptom,
wrestling.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.718
Then, under the lights
of the seizure lab...

30:43.843 --> 30:45.637
Are you going somewhere with this?
Because this feels...

30:45.762 --> 30:47.514
Just keep doing what
you're doing. It helps.

30:47.639 --> 30:52.644
Then, under the stress
of blindness, then, post-op fever.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.021
What do all the symptoms
have in common?

30:58.608 --> 30:59.567
Heat.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.823
See, if you hadn't been here,
that would've just popped into my head,

31:05.949 --> 31:08.535
which actually would
have been way cooler.

31:10.161 --> 31:14.123
Foreman, kid's got Uhthoff phenomenon,
which means it's MS.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.751
Start him on
double-dose interferon.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.419
Let's get our drink on.

31:18.545 --> 31:21.714
Not before I've added chemical burns
to this guy's cause of death.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.093
Patient's responding
to interferon.

31:25.218 --> 31:27.762
Looks like I can retire
as department figurehead.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.265
OFFICER: Dr. Robert Chase?

31:30.390 --> 31:32.767
We're with the Department of
Citizenship and Immigration.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.144
Did you recently apply
for a marriage license?

31:35.270 --> 31:36.688
Ah... Yes.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.107
According to our records,
your work permit has expired.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.692
If you could
come with us?

31:40.817 --> 31:42.402
I'm his fiancée.
I can come along and clear this...

31:42.527 --> 31:44.779
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Illegals only.

31:47.115 --> 31:48.283
I'm sure it's a mistake.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.785
I'll call you as soon as
I know what's going on.

31:53.496 --> 31:56.374
Don't let House get him
in too much trouble.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

32:20.982 --> 32:25.320
Allow me to welcome
you to the best night of your life.

32:33.244 --> 32:34.954
(CROWD CHEERING)

32:38.750 --> 32:43.796
Now, a few ground rules
for the evening. Safety is job one.

32:44.464 --> 32:48.259
We have now gone 18 days
without an injury in the workplace.

32:48.384 --> 32:53.723
Yes, these girls are all working their
way through law school, don't test them.

32:53.848 --> 32:54.891
House!

32:56.142 --> 32:57.852
I knew you
couldn't stay away.

33:03.232 --> 33:06.527
This is my apartment!
You can't do this.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.571
Clearly reality
begs to differ.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.992
Where's my furniture?

33:13.117 --> 33:14.535
Out back somewhere.

33:14.661 --> 33:15.620
KARAMEL: James!

33:18.748 --> 33:19.832
Karamel?

33:22.043 --> 33:23.127
Hey.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.008
How's your wife?

33:29.133 --> 33:30.635
We got divorced.

33:31.761 --> 33:33.805
- How's your cat?
- Dead.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.558
How about we go
have a drink?

33:38.768 --> 33:40.311
- This way.
- Okay.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.314
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

34:21.310 --> 34:22.478
You're okay with this?

34:22.603 --> 34:24.105
I paid 50 bucks for this.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.358
You guys are great together.
Trust is everything.

34:27.483 --> 34:30.528
I'm gonna get some air.
Keep it real.

34:49.130 --> 34:53.593
AMBER: You should be out there, enjoying
the lap dances of your labors.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.680
I kind of like it in here.

34:58.514 --> 34:59.807
Me, too.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.771
To us, figuring out MS.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.984
And the blindness and neuropathy, and
arrhythmia, and anything else we did.

35:14.572 --> 35:16.991
What exactly did
my team do?

35:17.992 --> 35:21.621
Looked good
in their lab coats, except for Taub.

35:23.414 --> 35:27.335
Some people just
work better alone, so to speak.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.129
One more drink.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.924
No. I can't.
I gotta take a break.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.384
Meet Karamel.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.598
Maybe one more drink.

35:50.983 --> 35:56.155
What's that taste?
Is that strawberry?

36:00.910 --> 36:02.078
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:02.203 --> 36:03.913
FOREMAN: House, you in there?

36:04.664 --> 36:08.376
Use the other bathroom.
It's in the kitchen, looks like a sink.

36:08.501 --> 36:12.505
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from
the stripper's body butter or something.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.132
Is he okay?

36:15.258 --> 36:17.510
One of the residents
had an EpiPen, so he's fine.

36:17.635 --> 36:20.680
But we're taking him to
the hospital to be safe.

36:21.681 --> 36:22.723
Okay-

36:28.563 --> 36:31.566
I knew that Chase was allergic
to strawberries, didn't I?

36:34.527 --> 36:37.071
That's why you wanted
Karamel at this party.

36:37.572 --> 36:41.534
I suggested Karamel
'cause she was great at Wilson's party.

36:41.659 --> 36:45.496
I knew about her body butter,
I knew about his strawberry allergy.

36:47.874 --> 36:49.625
I tried to kill Chase?

36:51.544 --> 36:54.547
Why would I do that?
I don't want Cameron.

36:55.548 --> 36:58.593
You're not a big fan of other people's
happiness either.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:05.600 --> 37:06.642
Hello.

37:08.686 --> 37:11.230
You confirm? Thanks.

37:14.609 --> 37:17.445
That kid we saved,
he's dying.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.114
It's not MS.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.325
We were wrong.

37:27.622 --> 37:29.957
CAMERON: Thank God
you're okay. What happened?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.918
- There was a girl...
- Long story.

37:32.418 --> 37:36.380
Your patient's lung failure rules out
MS. We put him on a ventilator.

37:37.715 --> 37:38.716
Enlarged lymphs could...

37:38.841 --> 37:40.927
Are any of you sober?

37:43.179 --> 37:45.890
Turn around, you need
to go to the hospital.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.352
I need to sleep.

37:54.190 --> 37:58.235
I'm you. You can't
just shut a door.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.947
You tried to kill Chase.

38:01.656 --> 38:04.867
I need to push you
back down, you're dangerous.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.535
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

38:06.661 --> 38:08.245
It's the hospital.

I'm not answering.

38:13.918 --> 38:14.919
Hello.

38:15.044 --> 38:16.754
I'm here with your team,

38:16.879 --> 38:21.634
trying to sober them up so they can help
treat your dying patient.

38:21.759 --> 38:23.135
Foreman's dying patient.

38:24.136 --> 38:28.224
What causes lung failure plus
your patient's previous symptoms?

38:28.349 --> 38:29.600
Eosinophilic pneumonitis.

38:29.809 --> 38:31.435
White blood cells accumulate,

38:31.560 --> 38:34.897
clog up the lungs,
lead to heart problems. It fits.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.649
House, are you there?

38:37.233 --> 38:40.444
It's not
eosinophilic pneumonitis.

38:40.569 --> 38:41.487
HOUSE: I gotta crash.

38:41.612 --> 38:43.364
House, don't hang up.
We need your help.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.490
I can't.

38:44.699 --> 38:46.409
We can solve this.

38:48.619 --> 38:50.121
Good night.

38:51.288 --> 38:54.166
Eosinophilic pneumonitis
could actually make sense.

38:54.291 --> 38:58.713
No, House ruled it out because it would
affect the larynx. Patient would be

39:00.089 --> 39:01.132
hoarse.

39:01.257 --> 39:04.343
Which we wouldn't
notice in a deaf kid who rarely speaks.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.306
Wait. Everyone's
getting breath mints.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.395
We need to hear Seth speak.

39:15.312 --> 39:18.190
That means taking out the tube.
Isn't that dangerous?

39:18.315 --> 39:20.234
It's the safest way to confirm
what's wrong with him.

39:20.359 --> 39:22.361
I need him to breathe out
once I pull on the tube.

39:22.486 --> 39:23.779
Okay-

39:37.001 --> 39:38.419
Say "ah."

39:49.555 --> 39:52.141
I'm sorry,
we were wrong.

39:54.393 --> 39:58.397
I need to suction out your
throat before we re-intubate.

40:05.279 --> 40:06.697
Your son smoke?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.366
I don't think so.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.660
Tobacco stains on his teeth.

40:15.790 --> 40:18.501
He says he used to chew tobacco
to cut weight for wrestling.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.585
Used to?

40:19.710 --> 40:21.962
Chewing tobacco wouldn't
explain his symptoms.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.757
But not chewing
tobacco might.

40:25.758 --> 40:28.385
Taub was right.
It's sarcoidosis.

40:29.095 --> 40:33.015
The tobacco releases toxins, those
toxins suppressed his immune system.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.017
Once he quit chewing,

40:35.142 --> 40:38.437
the absence of those toxins kicked
a dormant condition into hyper-drive.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.608
Is it treatable?

40:44.026 --> 40:47.404
Usually responds to corticosteroids
and methotrexate.

40:48.197 --> 40:49.990
I'll start the meds.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.331
I need sleeping pills.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.585
I was gonna hit up Wilson, but he's
not answering his phone.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.671
He must have left
it in his pants,

41:03.796 --> 41:07.925
which he wasn't wearing when the police
found him trying to walk home, oddly,

41:08.050 --> 41:10.136
from his own apartment.

41:14.265 --> 41:15.266
Pills.

41:16.767 --> 41:20.104
Your patient is doing fine,
thanks to your team.

41:22.857 --> 41:25.359
It wasn't eosinophilic
pneumonitis, was it?

41:25.776 --> 41:28.028
Sarcoidosis.

41:28.154 --> 41:29.155
Good.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.367
House, please, talk to me.

41:43.377 --> 41:47.381
I haven't slept through the night
since Kutner killed himself.

42:05.274 --> 42:06.984
The wrestling
might have to wait.

42:08.402 --> 42:11.238
I'm gonna tell your doctors
to repair your implant.

42:14.325 --> 42:16.827
I know.
And then you ripped it out

42:16.952 --> 42:19.413
rather than live with
it for a few days even.

42:21.332 --> 42:24.501
I'm your mother.
This is my call.

42:25.044 --> 42:29.715
I don't know if I'm making
the right one, but it's mine to make.

43:11.465 --> 43:12.508
Sleep well?
