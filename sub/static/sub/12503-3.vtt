00:00.015 --> 00:02.033
Previously on Life UneXpected

00:02.035 --> 00:04.640
you and someone had a kid.

00:04.641 --> 00:05.788
You gave up that kid.

00:05.789 --> 00:06.947
I am that kid.

00:06.948 --> 00:08.650
And now I'm applying
for emancipation.

00:09.162 --> 00:10.613
Cate Cassidy... that's your mom.

00:10.614 --> 00:12.980
Cate Cassidy was pregnant
in high school? Yes.

00:12.981 --> 00:15.661
Cate and I are back
from our honeymoon.

00:15.662 --> 00:17.484
And we did not
return empty-handed.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.736
We'd like to introduce

00:18.737 --> 00:22.893
the latest edition to morning madness...
Kelly Campbell.

00:22.894 --> 00:24.846
I am not granting
you emancipation.

00:24.847 --> 00:25.935
I'm releasing you

00:25.936 --> 00:27.614
back into their temporary

00:27.615 --> 00:28.918
joint custody.

00:28.919 --> 00:30.422
We are firing you.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.109
Ryan and Kelly debut tomorrow.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.427
How would you like

00:33.428 --> 00:35.669
to produce the Ryan
and Kelly show?

00:38.706 --> 00:39.646
Is it the bar?

00:41.373 --> 00:43.005
Paige. Is Ryan here?

00:43.006 --> 00:45.690
No, your brother's
still at the station.

00:45.691 --> 00:47.387
There is no bar. Since when?

00:47.388 --> 00:48.854
Since you burned it down.

00:48.855 --> 00:50.581
I may not have the right
resume or credentials,

00:50.582 --> 00:52.771
but I'm a hard worker,
I'm determined and I'm fearless,

00:52.772 --> 00:55.067
because, believe me,
I have nothing to lose.

00:55.068 --> 00:57.888
But you got to know,
I want this job.

00:57.889 --> 00:59.392
I needed this.

01:00.196 --> 01:02.427
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

01:02.789 --> 01:04.296
You're a...? Teacher.

01:04.408 --> 01:07.821
Your daughter is failing
out of Westmonte.

01:07.822 --> 01:11.896
She needs to get an "a"
on this Thursday's midterm.

01:13.571 --> 01:15.532
A 95!

01:34.747 --> 01:36.991
I know that I was only
unemployed for a couple of days,

01:36.992 --> 01:39.422
but I kind of got
used to sleeping in.

01:41.137 --> 01:43.489
Mm... well, you know
what they say? Hmm?

01:43.490 --> 01:45.732
The early bird gets the worm.

01:46.904 --> 01:48.969
That was a... that was a euphemism.

01:48.970 --> 01:49.922
Yeah, I got it.

01:49.923 --> 01:51.684
You get that? Yeah, I got it.

02:03.972 --> 02:07.283
Wow, I don't think I've
ever seen you up this early.

02:07.284 --> 02:09.589
You know, sober.

02:09.590 --> 02:12.292
This is a big day, Matthew.
Matthew?

02:12.293 --> 02:15.339
Yeah. You know,
first day on the real job.

02:15.340 --> 02:19.888
Just, uh... practicing
sounding professional.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.763
Today's my first day coaching
girls' JV basketball.

02:22.764 --> 02:24.707
How am I supposed to sound? Dude,

02:24.708 --> 02:25.884
you should sound pumped.

02:25.885 --> 02:28.290
We're both heading into
exciting new territory here.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.083
While I'm braving the
world of finance,

02:30.084 --> 02:32.341
you will be teaching
Lux how to dribble.

02:32.342 --> 02:35.213
I told you, there's no way
you're going to get her to play.

02:35.214 --> 02:38.340
Lux won't even play
basketball on the Wii.

02:38.341 --> 02:43.105
Well, maybe Lux hasn't
had the experience

02:43.106 --> 02:44.904
to make her love it yet.

02:45.315 --> 02:48.667
Now, this is going to be great...

02:48.668 --> 02:50.447
for both of us.

02:51.391 --> 02:52.807
Think positive, Matthew.

02:52.808 --> 02:54.786
Okay, not liking that.

02:59.436 --> 03:01.545
Hmm, you look cute.

03:01.546 --> 03:03.388
Thank you. I mean,
I am the producer now.

03:03.389 --> 03:05.077
I'm trying to look producer-y,

03:05.078 --> 03:06.577
even if I didn't want the job.

03:06.578 --> 03:07.575
That's the spirit.

03:07.576 --> 03:10.030
Okay, seriously... who does this?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.986
She's not the only one
around here who drinks milk.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.659
No. She's the only
one who confuses

03:16.660 --> 03:19.049
the fridge for going here?

03:19.573 --> 03:20.734
And she's the only one

03:20.735 --> 03:22.741
that would drink a
$200 bottle of wine

03:22.742 --> 03:24.939
that my aunt gave
us for our wedding!

03:24.940 --> 03:26.381
Can you keep it down, please?

03:26.382 --> 03:28.350
Oh, it's not like she's
going to wake up.

03:29.062 --> 03:30.637
And there's nothing to eat.

03:30.638 --> 03:32.670
Why is there nothing to eat?

03:33.968 --> 03:35.982
Did I tell you that she
borrowed my car yesterday,

03:35.983 --> 03:37.064
and she scratched the door?

03:37.065 --> 03:39.184
Yes, verbally and via text.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.339
You need to do
something about this.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.473
She said she was crashing
for a couple of days.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.602
A couple of day came and
went a couple of days ago.

03:46.603 --> 03:47.948
Okay, you're repeating your words,

03:47.949 --> 03:50.218
so I know you're annoyed,
but, Cate, she's family,

03:50.219 --> 03:52.713
and as far as sisters go,
she could be worse.

03:52.714 --> 03:54.792
Oh, then Abby.

03:55.512 --> 03:57.569
Paige is so much worse than Abby.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.461
Paige hasn't slept with Baze.

03:59.462 --> 04:00.611
Oh, pizza.

04:00.612 --> 04:01.802
I could eat...

04:02.915 --> 04:05.290
That's just cruel. Come on.

04:05.696 --> 04:08.193
Look, we'll get something
at work, all right?

04:08.194 --> 04:09.778
You don't want to be
late for your first day.

04:09.779 --> 04:11.301
I got your coffee.

04:12.155 --> 04:13.913
Ah, banana bread.

04:13.914 --> 04:15.290
Thank you.

04:33.627 --> 04:37.337
Paige. Hey, Paige.

04:37.643 --> 04:38.848
Wake up.

04:40.042 --> 04:40.860
Hey.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.382
Hey.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.265
What are you doing here?

04:44.266 --> 04:45.895
I'm taking Lux to school.

04:45.896 --> 04:47.289
We need to talk.

04:47.290 --> 04:48.915
I heard from my dad's
insurance company,

04:48.916 --> 04:49.847
and they said they would cover

04:49.848 --> 04:52.148
the structural damage to the bar.

04:52.149 --> 04:54.985
Oh, sweet. No, but it's not sweet,

04:54.986 --> 04:56.568
because everything else
I lost in the fire,

04:56.569 --> 05:00.191
which comes to about
$20,000, we have to pay for.

05:00.192 --> 05:02.573
Oh, God, that sucks.

05:02.574 --> 05:04.146
Good luck with that.

05:04.147 --> 05:06.473
The "we" that I'm
talking about... mm-hmm.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.331
Is us, Paige... you and me.

05:09.332 --> 05:10.548
I'm not following.

05:10.549 --> 05:12.151
You burned down my bar.

05:12.152 --> 05:14.162
I think it's fair
you pay for half.

05:14.163 --> 05:16.053
$10,000?!

05:16.054 --> 05:17.197
I can't pay for it myself.

05:17.198 --> 05:18.503
I put all my savings
into that bar,

05:18.504 --> 05:20.146
and I can't seem to rent
Jamie's room in the loft

05:20.147 --> 05:22.046
because no one wants to
live above a giant ashtray.

05:22.047 --> 05:23.498
Okay, so what do
you want me to do?

05:23.499 --> 05:24.670
You want me to ask Ryan for it?

05:24.671 --> 05:26.165
Oh, God no. Don't ask Ryan.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.402
No, don't do that.

05:27.403 --> 05:29.130
He would ask what you
were doing in my bar.

05:29.131 --> 05:31.053
No, no, not Ryan.

05:31.054 --> 05:33.175
Um... look.

05:33.176 --> 05:35.200
I got a job, okay?

05:35.201 --> 05:36.828
I am working for my half.

05:36.829 --> 05:39.601
I am asking that you take
responsibility for yours.

05:39.602 --> 05:40.824
You don't have to
pay me all at once.

05:40.825 --> 05:42.597
You pay me in installments,

05:42.598 --> 05:44.278
like, 500 bucks a
month or something.

05:44.279 --> 05:45.860
But you got to start
paying me soon.

05:45.861 --> 05:47.202
Baze?

05:49.073 --> 05:50.528
Hey, you're early.

05:50.529 --> 05:51.793
Hey, good morning, kiddo.

05:51.794 --> 05:53.131
I got you a present.

05:53.132 --> 05:54.191
Think fast.

05:56.945 --> 05:58.659
You want me to play basketball?

05:58.660 --> 06:02.464
Well... I want you
to at least try.

06:02.465 --> 06:05.779
Why? Because there's more to
school than grades, that's why.

06:05.780 --> 06:06.852
Tell that to Cate.

06:06.853 --> 06:07.764
Cate.

06:08.502 --> 06:12.009
Cate spent all of high
school in a library studying,

06:12.010 --> 06:13.259
getting pelted with spitballs.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.320
While I, on the other hand, played

06:14.321 --> 06:15.669
sports and arguably better

06:15.670 --> 06:17.685
than Cate ever did.

06:17.686 --> 06:21.156
I mean, not about adverbs or
parallelograms or whatever,

06:21.157 --> 06:22.737
but about teamwork,

06:22.738 --> 06:24.815
discipline, setting goals.

06:24.816 --> 06:25.858
You know what else?

06:25.859 --> 06:26.970
I walked the halls

06:26.971 --> 06:28.043
spitball free.

06:28.044 --> 06:29.125
Another perk...

06:29.126 --> 06:30.667
no more stressing about grades.

06:30.668 --> 06:34.211
Because teachers always let
athletes slide a little bit.

06:36.822 --> 06:37.820
Come on.

06:38.305 --> 06:40.435
Give us a chance to spend
more time together.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.021
I'm gonna suck.

06:45.156 --> 06:46.163
Yeah, you thought you
were going to suck

06:46.164 --> 06:47.914
on the English midterm, right?

06:47.915 --> 06:50.424
But you studied,
and you got an "a."

06:51.169 --> 06:53.948
I'm just asking that you
give this a shot, too.

07:01.068 --> 07:02.641
Hi. Nate Bazile.

07:02.642 --> 07:03.852
Do you know where I should go?

07:03.853 --> 07:05.252
Yes, it's right over there.
Thanks.

07:12.505 --> 07:13.658
Okay.

07:30.230 --> 07:31.420
You're late.

07:33.096 --> 07:35.411
I thought the market open at 9:30.

07:35.412 --> 07:36.925
East coast time.

07:36.926 --> 07:38.973
I'd also like to remind you

07:38.974 --> 07:41.160
that you're no longer
working in a bar anymore.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.048
Our investors are
high-profile people

07:43.049 --> 07:44.191
with high-pressure careers

07:44.192 --> 07:47.471
and zero tolerance for frat
boys who show up two hours late.

07:47.472 --> 07:48.526
I'm really sorry.

07:48.527 --> 07:51.147
I have to drop my kid off
at school in the mornings.

07:51.148 --> 07:53.149
Oh, right, the illegitimate one.

07:54.222 --> 07:56.155
You know, let me break
it down for you, Nate.

07:56.156 --> 08:00.039
In this business,
perception is everything.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.709
Clients don't want to hear excuses

08:01.710 --> 08:03.999
or hear about your
personal problems.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.293
If they don't think you have
your own life under control,

08:06.294 --> 08:08.440
how the hell are you
supposed to handle theirs?

08:08.441 --> 08:10.005
So, any disaster

08:10.006 --> 08:12.192
that is your life,
they don't want to hear about it.

08:12.193 --> 08:13.945
And neither do I.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.410
Okay.

08:23.005 --> 08:23.902
Don't go anywhere.

08:23.903 --> 08:27.019
Portland, keep your
dials tuned to k-100.

08:27.020 --> 08:30.622
We'll be back after this
word from Candoli's pizza.

08:30.623 --> 08:32.037
Get it while it's hot.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.636
You guys, really
fun stuff in there.

08:34.638 --> 08:35.717
That was really great.

08:35.719 --> 08:36.852
Really great.

08:36.854 --> 08:37.912
Just one thing, Kelly...

08:37.913 --> 08:38.905
I couldn't help noticing

08:38.907 --> 08:40.863
this clicking sound in your voice.

08:40.864 --> 08:42.110
It was like...

08:44.693 --> 08:46.014
see how that's annoying?

08:46.015 --> 08:47.642
Yes, I do. It used to happen to me

08:47.643 --> 08:48.887
all the time, too.

08:48.888 --> 08:50.132
You might want to take a bite

08:50.133 --> 08:51.865
out of an apple. It helps.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.932
Oh, think that there's
some in the break room.

09:02.065 --> 09:03.567
So? Yeah?

09:03.568 --> 09:05.040
How you doing? Doing good.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.325
I'm doing really good.

09:06.326 --> 09:08.628
Doing good. Things are going
really swimmingly, you know.

09:08.629 --> 09:10.481
They're... sweet swimmingly.

09:11.091 --> 09:13.079
"Swimmingly,
" that's a word, isn't it?

09:13.080 --> 09:14.480
I mean, that is a word-
"swimmingly"?

09:14.481 --> 09:17.266
Yeah, it's a... it's a word.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.646
You all right?

09:18.823 --> 09:20.322
Yeah. I'm really good.

09:20.323 --> 09:23.252
I mean, my tongue feels
really heavy in my mouth,

09:23.253 --> 09:25.531
like it's taking up
more space or something.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.934
Hmm, maybe it's swollen.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.148
Maybe my mouth is getting smaller.

09:31.953 --> 09:34.252
I cannot stop eating this
banana bread you made.

09:34.253 --> 09:35.632
It is delicious.

09:37.529 --> 09:39.306
I didn't make any banana bread.

09:39.307 --> 09:41.877
Well, Lux, she definitely
did not make it,

09:41.878 --> 09:42.615
because that girl...

09:42.616 --> 09:45.083
she can't even turn the stove on.
Oh, God, Cate.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.122
Uh, put the bread down.

09:46.123 --> 09:48.016
Put the bread down!

09:48.854 --> 09:49.693
Out.

09:51.256 --> 09:52.228
Paige made this.

09:52.229 --> 09:53.850
It means there's more
here than just bananas.

09:54.352 --> 09:56.069
Like love?

09:56.070 --> 09:57.539
Like pot.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.354
Are you telling me
that I just inhaled

10:00.355 --> 10:02.727
an entire loaf of
pot banana bread?!

10:02.728 --> 10:03.474
Mm-hmm.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.595
Ooh, what'd I miss?

10:22.235 --> 10:26.466
***

10:34.676 --> 10:35.602
Hey, I got you

10:35.603 --> 10:36.568
your venti, nonfat,

10:36.569 --> 10:38.261
two splenda latte as requested.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.464
Bastard!

10:40.497 --> 10:41.387
Not you.

10:41.509 --> 10:44.488
That was... a friend
of mine from u of o.

10:44.489 --> 10:45.933
He promised me two of
his football players

10:45.934 --> 10:47.122
would participate in the firm's

10:47.123 --> 10:48.364
charity golf tournament tomorrow,

10:48.365 --> 10:49.542
and they just pulled out.

10:49.876 --> 10:51.131
I'm playing with a
potential client

10:51.132 --> 10:52.249
and we need two celebrity guests

10:52.250 --> 10:53.727
to fill out our foursome.

10:54.158 --> 10:58.497
Uh, you... I... I may know
some guys that can step in.

10:58.611 --> 11:00.317
I need actual celebrities.

11:00.318 --> 11:03.593
Not some friend of yours who
once won a taco eating contest.

11:03.594 --> 11:07.347
What about Andre Miller
and Marcus Camby?

11:07.727 --> 11:09.181
Portland trailblazers?

11:09.906 --> 11:11.402
You know them? Do I know... Yes.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.033
They used to come into
the bar all the time.

11:13.034 --> 11:14.626
Once, we got drunk together
and went to the roof,

11:14.627 --> 11:17.145
and we started firing beer
cans off of the, uh...

11:17.146 --> 11:19.320
Uh, not important, never happened.

11:19.321 --> 11:21.158
I could try to get ahold of them.

11:21.159 --> 11:23.366
Don't just try, get it done.

11:28.346 --> 11:29.629
Hey, Cate.

11:29.630 --> 11:31.184
Baze, thank God you answered.

11:31.185 --> 11:32.426
I really need your help.

11:32.427 --> 11:35.389
Um, how do I get un-high?

11:35.390 --> 11:37.031
Are you anywhere near a hot tub?

11:37.032 --> 11:37.959
Uh, no.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.948
Then I can't help you.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.058
No, Baze, seriously.

11:40.059 --> 11:43.125
Okay, my mouth is totally dry,
my eyes are swelling shut.

11:50.552 --> 11:51.664
I can do this.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.162
A man should make it clear

11:54.163 --> 11:55.763
exactly how much he makes a year?

11:55.764 --> 11:56.789
Absolutely.

11:57.189 --> 11:58.664
That way, the woman knows

11:58.665 --> 12:01.291
what kind of lifestyle she's
looking at down the line.

12:01.292 --> 12:03.041
And that's not at all superficial?

12:03.042 --> 12:04.618
It's practical.

12:04.619 --> 12:06.211
When making any big decision,

12:06.212 --> 12:08.737
you always want to have as
much information as possible.

12:08.738 --> 12:12.579
Ryan, dating is just the process

12:12.580 --> 12:14.651
of deciding to marry someone.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.986
Says the woman that no
man has decided to marry.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.028
I mean, do you think

12:19.029 --> 12:20.404
Barbie in here is really

12:20.405 --> 12:21.868
a born-again virgin by choice?

12:22.888 --> 12:24.254
What if she's a doll,

12:24.255 --> 12:25.974
like, all plastic down there?

12:30.124 --> 12:31.489
Your mic is on.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.415
I got corporate on
line two for you.

12:40.613 --> 12:41.565
Hello.

12:48.677 --> 12:49.537
Okay.

12:50.016 --> 12:50.619
Good effort.

12:50.815 --> 12:51.938
Love the hustle.

12:52.351 --> 12:54.251
Let's take five.

12:55.589 --> 12:56.510
Diana.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.674
Jones, hey. Hey.

13:00.815 --> 13:01.736
I can't believe you're
playing basketball.

13:01.737 --> 13:05.015
Any advice or words
of encouragement?

13:07.132 --> 13:08.865
Nice socks?

13:09.965 --> 13:12.803
I told Baze this was a bad idea.

13:12.804 --> 13:13.816
The socks?

13:13.817 --> 13:15.320
The basketball.

13:15.321 --> 13:17.015
What, is this like,
a parent thing?

13:17.016 --> 13:19.247
The whole follow
in their footsteps,

13:19.248 --> 13:20.743
turn you into them?

13:20.744 --> 13:22.874
Because after I
humiliate myself here,

13:22.875 --> 13:23.921
I get to go home and study for

13:23.922 --> 13:25.956
a test that I'm going to fail

13:25.957 --> 13:29.992
or you could blow it off,
and we could go grab food.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.243
Uh, just be as friends,

13:31.244 --> 13:33.281
I promise. A group thing.

13:33.282 --> 13:34.959
Besides, you'll study
better when you get home.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.644
Pizza is like spinach
for your brain.

13:37.645 --> 13:40.511
Okay, well, I need, like,
a billion slices.

13:40.512 --> 13:43.444
And I got to get my English
grade up or I'm gonna fail out,

13:43.445 --> 13:45.246
but maybe next time.

13:47.096 --> 13:48.303
You hooking me up for tomorrow?

13:48.304 --> 13:50.757
'Cause Mr. Rogers says that
test is gonna be impossible.

13:50.758 --> 13:51.545
Don't worry about it.

13:51.546 --> 13:52.488
We're all set.

13:52.489 --> 13:53.927
Bring the cash to pizza tonight,

13:53.928 --> 13:56.961
and you'll get the blue book
with the answers already in it.

14:01.865 --> 14:03.919
Hey, I changed my mind.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.840
I'm in for pizza tonight.

14:05.841 --> 14:08.031
I could use all the
spinach I can get.

14:08.032 --> 14:09.447
Awesome.

14:17.338 --> 14:18.568
So how bad was it?

14:18.569 --> 14:20.405
She said, you know,
with all the money

14:20.406 --> 14:22.926
that they're using to
promote you and Kelly,

14:22.927 --> 14:25.327
that it would be a shame if
the audience pictured her

14:25.328 --> 14:27.851
having gender-neutral
doll genitalia.

14:28.870 --> 14:30.432
Can't argue with that.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.815
Yeah, thanks for the
vote of confidence.

14:33.485 --> 14:36.145
I mean, do you even care at all
that this is Paige's fault?

14:36.146 --> 14:37.001
The Barbie talk?

14:37.002 --> 14:37.907
That was all you.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.412
Why are you defending her?

14:39.413 --> 14:42.398
No, forget jeopardizing
my entire career.

14:42.399 --> 14:44.132
There is a teenager
living in the house.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.531
I mean, what if Lux had eaten
a loaf of drugs for breakfast?

14:46.532 --> 14:48.359
I mean, that's not okay.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.079
Your sister needs to go.

14:55.047 --> 14:57.008
Yes, I understand

14:57.009 --> 14:58.283
that you have a lot of requests

14:58.284 --> 14:59.545
for Marcus to ap

14:59.546 --> 15:01.728
but my job kind of
depends on this,

15:01.729 --> 15:05.855
so if you could just give him
a message, he'd remember me.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.200
He hung out at my bar.

15:08.201 --> 15:10.103
And we, uh...

15:10.104 --> 15:14.011
Well, we used to... we threw
beers from the roof together.

15:15.246 --> 15:16.214
Hello?

15:31.328 --> 15:32.127
Hello.

15:32.128 --> 15:33.490
Hi, Cate.

15:33.491 --> 15:34.834
I need a favor.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.776
Mm, are you near a hot tub?

15:36.777 --> 15:37.345
No.

15:37.346 --> 15:38.804
Well, then I can't help you.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.604
All right, I deserve that.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.766
Hot tubs, they really
do sober you up,

15:43.767 --> 15:47.230
so I was being helpful,
and, uh, two,

15:47.231 --> 15:48.434
I'm trying to make up for kind

15:48.435 --> 15:50.593
of a rocky start, wondering if

15:50.594 --> 15:52.115
my dad's firm is having

15:52.116 --> 15:54.011
a charity golf
tournament tomorrow,

15:54.012 --> 15:55.547
and a couple
celebrities bailed out

15:55.548 --> 15:56.587
at the last second.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.005
So, you want to know if
Ryan and I are available?

15:59.006 --> 16:01.762
Actually, I was wondering if

16:01.763 --> 16:05.293
Ryan and Kelly might be available.

16:05.835 --> 16:07.808
So, what, Kelly's a celebrity now?

16:07.809 --> 16:09.627
I mean, God,
that didn't take long.

16:09.628 --> 16:13.830
Okay, I'm sorry, Cate,
but I am desperate.

16:13.831 --> 16:15.312
Bunch of bigwigs
are gonna be there.

16:15.313 --> 16:16.729
It's local celebrities
playing with

16:16.730 --> 16:19.526
important potential
investors for the firm.

16:19.527 --> 16:22.491
Um, lots of press.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.032
I mean, after today,
the show could use that.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.105
I mean, I could use that.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.830
I mean, yeah, why not?

16:29.831 --> 16:30.812
Really?

16:30.813 --> 16:31.329
Yeah.

16:31.330 --> 16:32.395
I'm a producer now.

16:32.396 --> 16:34.066
This is me producing.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.700
Yeah, I like this.

16:35.701 --> 16:38.409
I like this you and me
getting along thing.

16:38.410 --> 16:39.794
Uh, yeah, me, too.

16:39.795 --> 16:41.163
Don't screw it up.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.003
Hey, there.

16:43.004 --> 16:44.683
Uh, dinner's gonna
be here in a bit.

16:44.684 --> 16:46.252
I hope you're good with Chinese.

16:46.253 --> 16:48.070
I, um, I forgot to tell you,

16:48.071 --> 16:50.836
but I'm gonna be meeting
some friends for pizza.

16:50.837 --> 16:51.993
Oh, oh.

16:51.994 --> 16:54.600
Um, well, do you need money?
I just hit up the ATM.

16:54.601 --> 16:55.563
I'm good.

16:55.564 --> 16:57.108
And, Lux, what about your test?

16:57.109 --> 16:58.763
Did you finish studying?

16:58.764 --> 17:01.042
It's totally under control.

17:01.043 --> 17:02.433
I just have to say, the way that

17:02.434 --> 17:03.883
you have rebound at school

17:03.884 --> 17:05.671
I'm really proud of you.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.279
Thanks.

17:10.156 --> 17:11.247
Would you be home at 9:00?

17:11.248 --> 17:12.836
Yeah. Okay.

17:15.478 --> 17:16.221
Hi.

17:16.356 --> 17:17.558
Uh, let me just get my cash.

17:17.559 --> 17:18.750
One second.

17:18.751 --> 17:20.239
Okay.

17:36.739 --> 17:39.121
So I haven't seen
you around lately.

17:39.122 --> 17:42.051
Yeah, yeah, I guess
I've been pretty busy.

17:42.052 --> 17:44.098
My adoption hearing, the wedding,

17:44.099 --> 17:46.743
I tagged along on Ryan
and Cate's honeymoon.

17:46.744 --> 17:48.982
Wow. Yeah, we went to Vegas.

17:48.983 --> 17:49.911
I would tell you about it,

17:49.912 --> 17:52.201
but the ad campaign says
you're not supposed to.

17:55.369 --> 17:59.024
So I-I heard, uh,
you and bug broke up.

17:59.025 --> 18:00.069
We don't have to talk about it.

18:00.070 --> 18:01.945
I just wanted to make
sure you're all right.

18:01.946 --> 18:05.014
Yeah, no, no, it-it's okay.

18:06.261 --> 18:10.168
He kind of proposed,
and I wasn't ready.

18:10.169 --> 18:10.913
Whoa.

18:11.531 --> 18:12.985
Well, someone helped me see that.

18:12.986 --> 18:13.969
Someone?

18:13.970 --> 18:15.916
Like another guy?

18:16.910 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, yeah, not really.

18:19.001 --> 18:21.341
It was over before it started.

18:22.865 --> 18:24.761
You really have been busy.

18:25.741 --> 18:29.636
But I'm glad you weren't too
busy to come hang out tonight.

18:29.637 --> 18:32.403
Although we kind of
ditched the guys.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.840
Hey, you want another drink?

18:35.841 --> 18:37.153
Orange or lemon-lime?

18:38.046 --> 18:39.520
Um, half and half.

18:39.521 --> 18:40.621
All right.

18:41.065 --> 18:42.118
Thanks.

18:57.794 --> 18:58.524
Hi.

18:58.525 --> 19:02.974
Um, I want in on whatever
your version of studying is.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.459
We don't know what
you're talking about.

19:04.460 --> 19:06.393
Really? 'Cause I
overheard you today.

19:06.394 --> 19:07.966
You sounded like a bad episode

19:07.967 --> 19:11.329
of saved by the bell-
which is redundant.

19:11.330 --> 19:14.452
So let me put it to
you this way, screech.

19:15.184 --> 19:16.904
Let me in on this

19:16.905 --> 19:19.542
or I'm telling Mr.
Rogers that you're cheating.

19:21.905 --> 19:23.124
She stole it.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.500
You don't know that. Yes, I do.

19:24.501 --> 19:25.541
Paige stole it, Ryan.

19:25.542 --> 19:28.520
$300 cash doesn't just
disappear out of my wallet.

19:28.521 --> 19:30.403
All right, can we just
retrace your steps?

19:30.404 --> 19:31.238
Yes.

19:31.239 --> 19:33.208
All steps lead back to Paige.

19:34.181 --> 19:35.557
I mean, how do you not see that?

19:35.558 --> 19:38.174
Because she's not the only
one who lives in this house.

19:40.568 --> 19:42.893
Lux? Um, are you seriously

19:42.894 --> 19:44.908
trying to imply that
Lux stole from me?

19:44.909 --> 19:46.281
Because that is ridiculous.

19:46.282 --> 19:48.337
If you do not ask Paige, I will.

19:48.338 --> 19:49.948
Hey, ask me what?

19:49.949 --> 19:52.435
Chinese? Yes.

19:52.436 --> 19:54.232
I'm starving.

19:54.713 --> 19:58.072
All right, look, Cate's missing
some money from her wallet.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.830
Oh, bummer.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.644
Can I have the last dumpling?

20:01.645 --> 20:03.307
Awesome.

20:03.951 --> 20:07.605
Uh, any idea what happened to it?

20:07.606 --> 20:08.656
Nope.

20:08.695 --> 20:09.953
Gotta go.

20:12.162 --> 20:13.388
What, that's it?

20:13.389 --> 20:14.674
Your entire line of questioning

20:14.675 --> 20:16.854
is gonna stop at
"bummer" and "nope"?

20:17.271 --> 20:18.644
Look, I know my sister, okay?

20:18.645 --> 20:20.190
She didn't take the money.

20:20.191 --> 20:21.752
Now, I asked her.

20:21.753 --> 20:22.939
It's your turn.

20:22.940 --> 20:24.751
To what, cross-examine her?

20:24.752 --> 20:25.990
Not Paige.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.294
Fair is fair.

20:27.295 --> 20:28.822
You got to ask Lux.

20:29.913 --> 20:31.088
Hey, it's Lux.

20:31.089 --> 20:32.394
Leave a message.

20:32.395 --> 20:35.420
Hey, kiddo. Just wanted to see
how your first practice went.

20:35.421 --> 20:38.265
I, uh, I thought I'd be there,
but I am still at work.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.140
Boo.

20:39.141 --> 20:40.348
I'll call you later. Bye.

20:40.349 --> 20:42.011
Take a look at the
prospectus tonight,

20:42.012 --> 20:43.722
I think you'll be impressed.

20:43.723 --> 20:46.288
We rank number one in
technology stock research,

20:46.289 --> 20:48.058
middle market investment banking.

20:48.059 --> 20:49.293
But why not just save yourself

20:49.294 --> 20:50.681
the time and sigporadically.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.168
You won't regret it.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.024
I will take a look,

20:54.025 --> 20:56.234
and I will see you on the
golf course tomorrow.

20:56.235 --> 20:57.897
Looking forward to
meeting the trailblazers.

20:57.898 --> 20:58.661
Me, too.

20:58.662 --> 20:59.685
We're set for that, right?

20:59.686 --> 21:02.100
Um, well, actually, uh,

21:02.101 --> 21:04.065
turns out they had
other trails to blaze.

21:04.066 --> 21:05.689
But you'll be golfing with

21:05.690 --> 21:08.820
Kelly and Ryan, the hosts
of k-100's morning madness.

21:08.821 --> 21:10.508
Oh, I love that show.

21:10.509 --> 21:12.276
Yeah, I listen sporadically.

21:12.277 --> 21:14.427
There was this, um, girl...

21:15.051 --> 21:16.200
...Cate.

21:16.326 --> 21:17.457
Yikes.

21:17.458 --> 21:20.692
Yeah, knocked up by one guy,
engaged to another,

21:20.693 --> 21:22.556
sleeping around at 16,

21:22.557 --> 21:25.205
now there's this
kid running around.

21:26.090 --> 21:27.039
Um, yeah.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.568
No, I'm-I'm not familiar.

21:28.569 --> 21:29.332
Ah.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.806
Yeah, now there's
the new one... Kelly.

21:31.807 --> 21:33.512
She's single, right?

21:33.513 --> 21:35.303
Yes, sir, I believe so.

21:35.304 --> 21:37.963
My divorce just got
finalized, so...

21:37.964 --> 21:38.925
There's that.

21:38.926 --> 21:40.028
Uh, she'll be there.

21:40.029 --> 21:41.921
And we're looking
forward to it, tomorrow.

21:42.299 --> 21:44.228
Oh, and you'll be there,
too, right?

21:44.229 --> 21:45.960
To caddy, maybe?

21:46.848 --> 21:49.070
I... I will be there.

22:04.478 --> 22:07.004
Hey, Lux, um, can we talk to you?

22:08.189 --> 22:09.892
Um, I was just going to go study.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.606
Uh, we...

22:14.798 --> 22:17.249
$300 is missing from my wallet.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.172
Oh, I haven't seen it.

22:19.243 --> 22:20.695
This is not what we are asking.

22:20.696 --> 22:21.751
Okay, Ryan.

22:21.752 --> 22:22.850
Um...

22:24.090 --> 22:26.166
Lux, did you take it?

22:26.933 --> 22:28.466
You think I stole your money?

22:28.467 --> 22:30.298
No. I just had to ask.

22:30.299 --> 22:31.935
You had to?

22:32.825 --> 22:36.543
Because I've been doing
everything you asked me to do.

22:37.563 --> 22:39.107
I've been working my
butt off at school,

22:39.108 --> 22:40.773
I've been... I've been
getting my grades up,

22:40.774 --> 22:43.140
I even joined the the basketball
team to keep Baze happy,

22:43.141 --> 22:45.404
and you still think that
I'm this mess-up kid

22:45.405 --> 22:48.076
who would steal and
then lie about it.

22:49.093 --> 22:51.112
Oh, 'cause that is-
that's awesome.

22:51.113 --> 22:52.664
Okay, Lux, I didn't say that.

22:52.665 --> 22:54.645
You didn't have to.

23:19.048 --> 23:20.182
Kelly

23:25.273 --> 23:26.254
hey Cate

23:27.022 --> 23:29.720
thanks for waiting for me.
Paige had to drop me off.

23:30.650 --> 23:31.854
You let Paige borrow your car.

23:31.855 --> 23:33.706
I hope your insurance
covers theft.

23:34.886 --> 23:37.152
It's good to know
we're talking again.

23:37.641 --> 23:39.668
Yeah, well, until you realize
you've got a major blind spot

23:39.669 --> 23:42.725
when it comes to your sister,
we're not.

23:49.666 --> 23:52.368
Ooh, nice bib. Ooh.

23:52.563 --> 23:54.456
What are you-
what are you doing here?

23:54.457 --> 23:57.741
Well, you know, thought we could
do it on the putting green.

23:57.742 --> 23:58.970
Kidding.

24:00.345 --> 24:01.547
Here.

24:03.390 --> 24:05.042
What is... what is this?

24:05.043 --> 24:07.300
This is 300 bucks.

24:07.973 --> 24:09.017
It's the best I could do.

24:09.018 --> 24:10.705
So I'd appreciate it
if you'd just lay off,

24:10.706 --> 24:11.916
you know, until I get a job.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.369
Okay, okay, you got to go.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.887
What? You got to go.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.969
You are a lot nicer
when you're wasted.

24:21.106 --> 24:22.663
Why did some girl
dressed like a hooker

24:22.789 --> 24:24.102
just give you a wad of cash?

24:24.103 --> 24:25.839
Did that actually just happen?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.427
No, absolutely not.

24:27.428 --> 24:29.390
And there is nothing
to worry about.

24:31.522 --> 24:32.970
Oh, that's...

24:32.971 --> 24:34.143
that's probably nothing.

24:34.144 --> 24:35.277
I'm going to go check on that.

24:39.253 --> 24:41.578
What happened? She hit me in
the head with a golf ball!

24:41.579 --> 24:43.561
Accidentally! Hey,
you got a pretty good knot there.

24:43.562 --> 24:45.034
Okay, do you want me
to help get some ice?

24:45.035 --> 24:48.498
I want you to get me a
restraining order... from you!

24:48.706 --> 24:49.929
I'm done.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.027
What are you doing?

24:51.028 --> 24:52.166
My job depends on this.

24:52.167 --> 24:53.976
I just maimed the
host of my own show.

24:53.977 --> 24:55.585
My job is teetering precariously

24:55.586 --> 24:57.040
on the edge of secure as well.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.158
Some idiot just hit Kelly in
the head with a golf ball.

24:59.159 --> 25:00.787
She just dropped out
of the tournament.

25:00.788 --> 25:01.634
Weird.

25:01.635 --> 25:02.287
Wow.

25:02.288 --> 25:05.396
I can't lose this client.

25:06.221 --> 25:07.405
Where am I supposed to find

25:07.406 --> 25:09.742
another celebrity in 60 seconds?

25:11.691 --> 25:13.253
Well, I just want to say

25:13.254 --> 25:16.005
that I was a celebrity
until about a week ago.

25:16.006 --> 25:18.005
That's true. That's totally true.

25:18.006 --> 25:18.864
Why you could...

25:18.865 --> 25:21.384
I mean, you could fill in;
You could take her spot.

25:21.797 --> 25:24.359
Not exactly keeping her personal
life away from the client.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.156
Hey?

25:26.644 --> 25:28.340
We got a foursome or what?

25:30.863 --> 25:33.823
Not a word about how you
two know each other.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.371
All right, time's up.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.255
Pencils down.

25:40.256 --> 25:41.328
Pass your blue books

25:41.329 --> 25:42.576
to the front.

25:49.806 --> 25:52.231
No homework tonight,
but be ready to start

25:52.232 --> 25:53.988
a separate peace tomorrow.

25:53.989 --> 25:55.178
It's one of my favorites.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.592
So, how'd you do?

25:57.891 --> 25:59.197
Pretty well, I think.

25:59.198 --> 26:01.014
See, I told you the
pizza would help.

26:02.138 --> 26:03.066
Hold it, everyone.

26:03.067 --> 26:05.637
A few of the teachers in
the English department

26:05.638 --> 26:07.526
have been concerned
about cheating,

26:07.527 --> 26:09.735
so we've decided to mark

26:09.736 --> 26:11.808
the test booklets we hand out,

26:11.809 --> 26:14.119
and I see a few of these

26:14.120 --> 26:15.870
don't have marks.

26:16.811 --> 26:18.271
Told you, you were idiots.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.214
Shut up, dude.
The following people

26:20.215 --> 26:21.812
please stay behind.

26:22.082 --> 26:27.175
Chris Davies, Mike Bennett,
Max Jacobs...

26:34.009 --> 26:35.807
...And Lux Cassidy.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.864
Everyone else is dismissed.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.999
Is that why you decided
to come last night?

26:45.456 --> 26:47.620
To get in on their cheating ring?

26:55.288 --> 26:56.586
I can't believe you.

26:56.587 --> 26:58.799
If you think Lux would
steal and lie about it,

26:58.800 --> 27:00.207
we have a bigger
problem on our hands.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.242
I'm, I'm not saying Lux would,
okay... I'm just...

27:02.243 --> 27:03.592
But you can't face the fact

27:03.593 --> 27:04.858
that Paige would?

27:04.859 --> 27:07.094
You know, we're your family now-
me and Lux.

27:08.186 --> 27:09.016
Okay, you know what?

27:09.017 --> 27:11.206
Can you guys hit pause on this
episode of Jerry springer?

27:11.207 --> 27:12.444
You're distracting the client.

27:12.445 --> 27:14.053
Sure. Thanks, Ryan.

27:14.054 --> 27:15.704
Anything for Cate's
side of the family.

27:15.705 --> 27:18.391
Your sister is a grown
woman that stole money

27:18.392 --> 27:20.538
and lied to my face, and to yours!

27:20.539 --> 27:22.128
You don't know Paige
stole it, okay?

27:22.129 --> 27:23.618
It could have been Lux.

27:23.619 --> 27:25.177
All right, what about Lux?

27:25.178 --> 27:26.522
What are we talking about here?

27:26.523 --> 27:28.943
There's $300 missing from
Cate's purse. Mm-hmm.

27:28.944 --> 27:32.068
Yeah, and he would rather
accuse our kid than his sister.

27:32.069 --> 27:34.341
Lux is not a thief, Ryan.

27:34.342 --> 27:36.405
By the way, Paige just
gave me 300 bucks.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.370
So... so could you be quiet?

27:38.819 --> 27:42.059
What? Why-why is Paige
giving you money?

27:42.060 --> 27:43.773
You don't even know Paige.

27:44.522 --> 27:45.896
Paige and I... you know, we met

27:45.897 --> 27:47.438
when she interviewed
for the bartenders gig.

27:47.439 --> 27:48.782
And she is paying me money

27:48.783 --> 27:52.415
because... she burned down my bar.

27:52.416 --> 27:53.618
What?!

27:53.976 --> 27:55.714
Wait, I thought a cigarette did.

27:56.417 --> 27:57.858
It was Paige's cigarette.

27:57.859 --> 27:59.579
7:00 in the morning?

28:02.635 --> 28:05.079
No, no, no.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.579
No, no, no, no!

28:07.580 --> 28:09.355
Oh, Ryan... after everything
we've been through...

28:09.356 --> 28:10.826
you're sleeping with my fiance,

28:10.827 --> 28:12.030
you interrupt our wedding.

28:12.031 --> 28:13.996
Do not tell me you
slept with my sister.

28:13.997 --> 28:15.192
Yeah, of course,
he slept with your sister.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.690
He slept with my sister.
He sleeps with everybody's sister.

28:17.691 --> 28:19.879
I didn't know that she
was anybody's sister.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.063
And I for sure hell didn't know

28:21.064 --> 28:22.472
that she was going
to burn down my bar,

28:22.473 --> 28:23.550
steal money from Cate

28:23.551 --> 28:25.142
and then frame my kid.

28:25.265 --> 28:27.985
All I am trying to do
right now is my job.

28:27.986 --> 28:30.380
So don't you make me out
to be the bad guy, Ryan.

28:30.381 --> 28:31.922
Not now!

28:35.423 --> 28:37.227
If you guys don't mind,

28:37.228 --> 28:39.300
I'm going to make
this my last hole.

29:01.024 --> 29:01.929
Get out.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.451
Okay. Not just out of the car...
our house,

29:08.452 --> 29:10.092
I know you stole the money, Paige,

29:10.093 --> 29:11.280
I know you slept with Baze,
and I know

29:11.281 --> 29:13.012
you burned down his bar.

29:14.997 --> 29:16.992
Where am I supposed to go?

29:17.118 --> 29:19.071
I defended you to Cate.

29:19.677 --> 29:22.257
And I even accused
my own stepdaughter.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.713
I'll drop you off on
my way to the station,

29:24.714 --> 29:27.440
but I want you packed and
gone by the time I get back.

29:37.189 --> 29:40.479
Mr. Jackson. I, uh,
I'm sorry to bother you,

29:40.480 --> 29:43.141
but I just-
I wanted to apologize.

29:46.806 --> 29:50.029
I hope that you won't let
what I said or who I am

29:50.030 --> 29:52.567
affect your decision to invest
your money with the firm.

29:52.568 --> 29:54.513
I'm not the guy that's going
to be managing the money.

29:54.514 --> 29:55.669
That's Emma.

29:55.829 --> 29:56.877
And that's who you want.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.748
She will eat, sleep and breathe

29:58.749 --> 30:01.147
your portfolio so that
you can rest easy.

30:01.148 --> 30:01.912
Me...

30:02.815 --> 30:04.648
I got this job two days ago.

30:05.027 --> 30:07.474
And my dad helped me get
my foot into the door.

30:07.475 --> 30:11.190
And I took the job to
prove something to him,

30:11.191 --> 30:13.551
and to my kid and to myself.

30:13.697 --> 30:15.412
And I have a lot to learn.

30:15.413 --> 30:17.605
You know, but as
badly as I want it,

30:17.606 --> 30:19.225
I'm not the type of guy

30:19.226 --> 30:21.911
who can hide who I am
to impress someone,

30:22.072 --> 30:25.839
even if who I am makes me
look bad to someone like you.

30:27.997 --> 30:29.091
So...

30:30.300 --> 30:31.972
What do you think?

30:37.015 --> 30:38.996
Don't worry, I'm not robbing you.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.511
I'm packing.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.065
I'm sorry I stole your money.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.778
But I guess you got
what you wanted.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.953
No, this isn't what I wanted.

30:53.094 --> 30:55.923
Right. You have hated
me since I showed up.

30:55.924 --> 30:57.493
I don't hate you, Paige.

30:57.866 --> 30:59.325
I just think that Ryan's given you

30:59.326 --> 31:01.123
one too many chances is all.

31:01.242 --> 31:03.297
How many chances has he given you?

31:03.705 --> 31:06.331
After all the crap
you pulled with Baze.

31:07.619 --> 31:09.931
You are so lucky
Ryan's the type of guy

31:09.932 --> 31:13.386
who would never turn
his back on family.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.764
If he were, he never
would have married you.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.466
Thanks for the hospitality.

31:33.330 --> 31:34.326
I cannot believe this.

31:34.327 --> 31:37.461
I mean, cheating doesn't
even make any sense.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.485
You've been doing so well.

31:39.870 --> 31:41.002
Not really.

31:42.786 --> 31:44.907
What about the midterm last week?

31:47.344 --> 31:49.659
Oh, um... I...

31:53.278 --> 31:55.734
I stole the answers
from math's man purse.

31:55.905 --> 31:57.576
It's a carry-all.

31:59.795 --> 32:01.632
But that's not the point.

32:01.781 --> 32:03.789
I mean, here I am, feeling guilty

32:03.926 --> 32:05.593
for accusing you of
lying and stealing

32:05.594 --> 32:07.059
and telling Ryan that
he's wrong about you,

32:07.060 --> 32:10.014
and that is exactly what
you're doing. Cate, ease up.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.075
Not everybody is a valedictorian.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.489
Maybe Lux wouldn't have felt

32:13.490 --> 32:15.491
like she had to cheat if you
hadn't been riding her so hard

32:15.492 --> 32:17.319
to get good grades.
Yeah, or if you hadn't forced her

32:17.320 --> 32:18.375
to sign up for basketball

32:18.376 --> 32:20.297
when she was already
struggling. Guys...

32:20.298 --> 32:22.127
I want her to know that
there is more to life

32:22.128 --> 32:23.979
than getting "A's".
Yes, there's always the pride

32:23.980 --> 32:25.433
of making the team
and joining the jocks

32:25.434 --> 32:27.155
in the cheating ring.
All right, stop!

32:29.327 --> 32:31.713
Look, this is how it is.

32:32.252 --> 32:33.495
I've never had a parent

32:33.496 --> 32:34.577
to help me with my homework.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.286
I've never gone to a school

32:36.287 --> 32:38.773
where they've actually given
a crap about how I did.

32:38.935 --> 32:41.255
I've never had a hobby,
I've never played a sport.

32:41.256 --> 32:45.514
I have never... I've never
taken piano lessons.

32:46.233 --> 32:49.694
Parent-teacher conferences-
I was always minus the parent.

32:49.836 --> 32:52.563
But what you're doing,
thinking that you can just

32:52.564 --> 32:53.798
sign me up

32:53.957 --> 32:56.291
or-or make me some flash cards,
and I'll be you.

32:56.793 --> 32:58.043
I'm... trying,

32:58.192 --> 33:00.061
but it's not working.

33:01.667 --> 33:04.187
So, if-if you want a
daughter that's you...

33:07.058 --> 33:10.168
...I'm sorry, but I think
you've got the wrong kid.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.948
Your new thinking spot?

33:41.058 --> 33:42.549
So how bad is it?

33:42.714 --> 33:43.811
Am I suspended?

33:43.812 --> 33:45.667
I got it knocked
down to detention.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.032
But there's something else.

33:49.916 --> 33:52.438
They're working with the
school to get you a tutor.

33:54.195 --> 33:56.374
No, I-I don't need a tutor.

33:59.314 --> 34:03.225
Look, I'm... sorry that I...

34:03.632 --> 34:05.383
I lied to you,

34:05.563 --> 34:07.354
I'm sorry I cheated, it's just...

34:08.614 --> 34:11.252
I need them to stop
pressuring me to be them.

34:13.483 --> 34:15.288
That's crap, Lux.

34:15.476 --> 34:16.862
Yes, they want you
to be like them.

34:17.003 --> 34:18.221
What parent doesn't?

34:18.349 --> 34:20.196
But that's not why you're upset.

34:21.543 --> 34:25.088
I think you're upset because
you're not who you want to be.

34:25.275 --> 34:26.460
Deep down,

34:27.893 --> 34:29.827
you want to be like them, too.

34:45.232 --> 34:46.134
Hey.

34:46.344 --> 34:47.416
Hey.

34:48.274 --> 34:49.466
Sure it's cool I called?

34:49.467 --> 34:52.716
Well, we need a roommate,
you need a room.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.305
But I will tell you this.

34:58.586 --> 35:01.884
If you burn down this loft,
I will kill you.

35:05.348 --> 35:06.373
Sweet.

35:08.229 --> 35:09.205
Baze?

35:11.733 --> 35:13.955
Lux, hey.

35:14.957 --> 35:16.302
What are you doing?

35:17.376 --> 35:18.446
I, uh,

35:19.481 --> 35:21.019
I want you to teach me...

35:22.035 --> 35:23.510
How to do this.

35:25.294 --> 35:26.652
All of this.

35:28.030 --> 35:31.308
I mean, you don't have
to do this for me.

35:34.171 --> 35:36.585
I want to do this for me, too.

35:58.621 --> 36:00.722
You know, you should
have seen Paige as a kid.

36:00.866 --> 36:02.117
Nobody could handle her.

36:03.324 --> 36:04.260
She...

36:05.509 --> 36:07.851
Remember this one time, she had,
she had chocolate icing

36:07.852 --> 36:11.644
all over her face,
and she would just flat-out deny

36:11.645 --> 36:13.105
she ever touched the cake.

36:15.742 --> 36:18.076
She was so convincing,
you almost believed her.

36:20.140 --> 36:22.300
I don't know,
maybe I just wanted to.

36:24.069 --> 36:27.059
Yeah, I think we all want to
see the good in people we love.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.479
You know, when you love people,

36:29.480 --> 36:31.711
you give them s

36:33.138 --> 36:34.846
and thirds and...

36:35.974 --> 36:37.523
And a million.

36:38.042 --> 36:39.834
Yeah, I'd do it for Lux and...

36:41.962 --> 36:44.481
God knows, you've done it for me.

36:46.892 --> 36:47.710
I shouldn't have given you

36:47.711 --> 36:50.043
such a hard time about
doing it for Paige.

36:53.427 --> 36:55.479
You know, maybe there's a
way that we can help her

36:55.480 --> 36:58.290
that fixes things for
more than just Paige.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.630
For our whole family.

37:02.486 --> 37:03.940
Math, hey.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.608
Yeah, she's back on the team.

37:06.759 --> 37:08.005
I know, yeah?

37:08.855 --> 37:10.801
Oh, dude, I am dying
to help coach,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.328
but work, you know.

37:12.487 --> 37:14.142
I don't know, maybe on weekends.

37:15.576 --> 37:17.264
Oh, dude, I got to go.

37:19.559 --> 37:20.272
Hey.

37:20.666 --> 37:21.901
Bruce Jackson called.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.068
Oh. To what, get me fired?

37:24.309 --> 37:26.535
He said he would love to
sign at Fenmore financial.

37:27.253 --> 37:29.533
Yeah, he seems to think
we make a great team.

37:30.180 --> 37:32.451
Um, said your honesty
was refreshing.

37:32.782 --> 37:34.076
And that he was sure you would

37:34.227 --> 37:36.732
always give it t you charm him

37:37.109 --> 37:38.355
why's your face like that?

37:38.482 --> 37:40.525
Because I busted my butt

37:40.657 --> 37:42.997
to sign him, and you charm him

37:43.123 --> 37:45.882
by doing the one thing
I told you not to do.

37:46.285 --> 37:49.039
It's more depressing than an
episode of the biggest loser.

37:50.783 --> 37:52.552
I'm sorry...

37:54.026 --> 37:55.605
I told you to lie.

37:56.600 --> 38:01.380
Apparently, who you are is
more appealing than I realized.

38:03.745 --> 38:04.732
Thanks?

38:06.182 --> 38:07.251
And, um...

38:08.965 --> 38:11.395
If you need a couple
hours each week

38:11.539 --> 38:15.092
because of the kid-
the illegitimate one...

38:15.793 --> 38:18.218
that can probably be arranged.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.680
Jones.

38:31.493 --> 38:32.237
Hey.

38:32.622 --> 38:34.041
We-we should talk.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.214
I-I know you must hate me.

38:37.879 --> 38:39.328
For lying to you.

38:40.588 --> 38:42.182
I don't hate you, Lux.

38:43.091 --> 38:44.952
I mean, I wish I did.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.536
It would make things easier.

38:47.638 --> 38:49.707
I lied, too, okay?

38:50.444 --> 38:52.756
When I said I wanted to
just go out as friends.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.219
I've wanted to be more
than friends with you

38:56.354 --> 38:57.756
since I met you.

38:57.887 --> 38:59.234
And since bug is
out of the picture,

38:59.342 --> 39:01.784
and this other guy was
over before it started...

39:02.847 --> 39:03.976
I don't know.

39:04.365 --> 39:07.700
Maybe... there's a chance for us.

39:08.664 --> 39:10.421
Either now or down the road.

39:10.823 --> 39:11.648
Yeah.

39:12.757 --> 39:13.958
Maybe.

39:27.049 --> 39:28.070
Eric?

39:28.531 --> 39:30.224
Wh-what are you doing here?

39:31.449 --> 39:32.677
Math didn't tell you?

39:35.134 --> 39:36.887
I'm your new tutor.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.127
All right, Lebron,
the first thing you need

39:51.259 --> 39:52.609
is a killer crossover.

39:52.741 --> 39:54.809
But in order to get one of those,

39:54.927 --> 39:57.343
you're gonna have to learn how
to dribble with both hands.

39:57.456 --> 40:00.216
So... right then left...

40:00.347 --> 40:01.471
Hey, Baze. Yeah?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.334
Hey, uh...

40:04.468 --> 40:05.472
What's this?

40:05.921 --> 40:07.828
It's ten grand.

40:08.497 --> 40:09.665
It's Paige's debt.

40:10.303 --> 40:11.328
Whoa.

40:11.939 --> 40:13.917
Um, are you sure?

40:14.071 --> 40:15.371
You guys don't need to do this.

40:15.525 --> 40:18.211
Yeah, we... we talked about it.

40:18.896 --> 40:21.010
You shouldn't be on the
hook for-for the money.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.588
You know, if she actually
manages to pay you back,

40:23.727 --> 40:25.818
you could just slip it to us.

40:26.456 --> 40:27.346
Thanks, man.

40:32.789 --> 40:33.524
All right.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.310
We gonna play or what?

40:35.463 --> 40:36.803
Yes, we're gonna play.

40:36.981 --> 40:38.889
All right, so, uh, Lux.

40:40.325 --> 40:42.489
Ryan, you guys want to
be on the same team?

40:42.964 --> 40:44.834
I don't know. Ryan?

40:45.024 --> 40:46.054
He might be afraid that I will

40:46.180 --> 40:48.081
steal the ball!

40:48.294 --> 40:50.024
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

40:50.219 --> 40:51.749
I deserve that. I deserve that.

40:53.588 --> 40:54.451
Oh, I got a better idea.

40:54.593 --> 40:55.238
I got a better idea.

40:55.380 --> 40:56.519
How about, uh...

40:56.644 --> 40:58.343
How about guys versus girls?

40:58.768 --> 40:59.716
All right.

41:01.117 --> 41:03.213
Baze and I will be on
the same team for once.

41:05.028 --> 41:05.908
You ready?

41:06.071 --> 41:06.766
Yeah, we're ready.

41:06.908 --> 41:08.028
One, two...
