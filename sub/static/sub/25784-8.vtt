I'll handle it,

03:02.596 --> 03:05.679

tell him he's pretty.

05:44.179 --> 05:47.012
and we can't afford
any slip-ups
from any associates.

05:47.095 --> 05:50.512

that we want him to take
the lead on this case--

05:50.596 --> 05:51.762

09:22.637 --> 09:24.721
The partners named me
co-counsel

09:24.803 --> 09:26.137
for our huge new client.

09:26.220 --> 09:28.721
What?!
Bitch, that's dope!

09:28.803 --> 09:30.262
They just did that
out of nowhere?

09:30.345 --> 09:32.762
No, I did what I had to
to get their attention.

09:32.845 --> 09:35.179
You called it shady,
but my instincts were right.

09:35.262 --> 09:37.053
This firm runs
just like my old firm.

09:37.137 --> 09:40.345
Well, I mean, you trying
to Annalise Keating
your co-workers

09:40.429 --> 09:42.679
seems stressful as fuck,
but good for you, girl.

09:42.762 --> 09:44.345
Yes, and it will all
be worth it

09:44.429 --> 09:45.803
when I'm back on
the partner track

09:45.887 --> 09:48.471
and I can take you  to Morocco.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.053
- Ahh!
- We are  dating!

09:51.137 --> 09:52.762
You guys,
this is my girlfriend!

09:52.845 --> 09:55.304
Nope, nope. Issa, get off me.
My man might be here.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.762
Molly:
But I got you. You're psycho.

09:58.845 --> 10:00.095
Issa:
Are there girls here?

10:00.179 --> 10:01.928
- Nigga, no--
- Lawrence: Hey.

10:02.012 --> 10:04.554
- Hey!
- Hey, Issa. I shoulda known
you'd be here.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.012
Playtime's over, boy!

10:06.095 --> 10:07.721
Kiss my Converse!

10:07.803 --> 10:10.012
Both:
Sho'nuff.

10:10.095 --> 10:12.220
- ( both laugh )
- Y'all are some nerds.

10:12.304 --> 10:16.095
Yup. Yeah, I'ma go,
I'm meetin' Chad and them.

10:16.179 --> 10:17.803
OK, I'll see you inside.

10:17.887 --> 10:19.637
A'ight.

10:19.721 --> 10:21.012
Bye, Lawrence.

10:23.928 --> 10:27.345
- You good?
- I was reading
the back of his shirt.

10:27.429 --> 10:29.220
OK. Sho'nuff.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.637
♪ Let 'em know
that you the baddest ♪

10:31.721 --> 10:34.387
♪ Let 'em know that
you the baddest ♪

10:34.471 --> 10:35.928
Dang, it's crowded.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.262
How we gonna find Kelli?

10:37.345 --> 10:39.179
Oh! I see her over there.

10:39.262 --> 10:41.928
Does this bitch
use birthday hats
as traffic cones?

10:42.012 --> 10:44.387
- Why she look like Sho'nuff?
- Lookin' like sho' you right!

10:44.471 --> 10:47.471
( sing-song )
Hey, the birthday bitch!

10:47.554 --> 10:48.970
Hi!

10:49.053 --> 10:51.262
Happy birthday, bitch!

10:51.345 --> 10:54.137
Issa:
Thank you! Yaass!

10:54.220 --> 10:57.095
Kelli! It's just
the three of us.

10:57.179 --> 10:58.512
We do not need
all this space.

10:58.596 --> 11:00.053
I'm not trying to have
a Coachella repeat,

11:00.137 --> 11:01.637
and I'm not trying
to fight any more white bitches

11:01.721 --> 11:03.095
until after the movie
is over, OK?

11:03.179 --> 11:05.471
But you still fighting
pregnant bitches, or...?

11:05.554 --> 11:08.387
Oh, girl, no!
Tiffany made her
the godmother.

11:08.471 --> 11:10.137
Now if she die,
I gotta take the baby.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.637
Wouldn't Derek
get the... baby?

11:12.721 --> 11:14.637
Is that how it works?
I hope so,

11:14.721 --> 11:17.179
because if I wanted a kid,
I woulda kept the last one.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.179
Ladies? A toast.

11:21.262 --> 11:24.345
To the baddest mofo,
no doubt, in the town!

11:24.429 --> 11:25.429
Happy birthday, Issa.

11:25.512 --> 11:27.012
- Happy birthday, girl!
- Thank you.

11:27.095 --> 11:28.345
Love y'all.

11:28.429 --> 11:29.845
I mean, look at us!

11:29.928 --> 11:31.762
Thirty. Single.

11:31.845 --> 11:32.845
- Yeah!
- Black!

11:32.928 --> 11:34.345
Out here thriving.

11:34.429 --> 11:36.220
Lookin' like all three
Jennifer Hudsons.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.679
One, two, three.

11:38.762 --> 11:39.845
Molly:
Wait, wait, wait.

11:39.928 --> 11:41.928
Single?
What about Julian?

11:42.012 --> 11:43.762
( whispers )
Julian?

11:43.845 --> 11:46.012
The tiny nigga
from Coachella.

11:46.095 --> 11:48.596
Girl, that nigga
was on some DJ Khaled shit,

11:48.679 --> 11:50.679
didn't want to go down on me.
So I told him,

11:50.762 --> 11:54.471
"You ain't smart,
you ain't  a genius," OK?

11:54.554 --> 11:56.137
You just better hope
he's not bringing
that foolishness

11:56.220 --> 11:57.345
over to Asian bae.

11:57.429 --> 11:58.637
Oh, Andrew?

11:58.721 --> 12:00.429
No, he's dead. R.I.P.

12:01.803 --> 12:02.803
What?

12:02.887 --> 12:05.220
What happened?
Was it the 405?

12:05.304 --> 12:08.596
- ( Issa laughs )
- To me.  He's dead to  me.

12:08.679 --> 12:11.262
Girl, you can't be makin' jokes
about death in a graveyard!

12:11.345 --> 12:13.596
It's too bad.
I almost liked him.

12:13.679 --> 12:15.512
He was doing too much.

12:15.596 --> 12:19.053
That's real.
You can't keep a nigga
if he's doing too much. OK?

12:19.137 --> 12:20.387
Mm-mm.

12:20.471 --> 12:21.762
Exhibit A.

12:21.845 --> 12:24.053
I had to cut off
that nigga right over there.

12:24.137 --> 12:25.970
The one that looks
like Forest Whitaker?

12:26.053 --> 12:28.471
Don't judge, OK?

12:28.554 --> 12:31.429
Oh, shit,
I fucked that nigga too! Shit!

12:31.512 --> 12:34.012
All my sex ghosts
are in this graveyard!

12:34.095 --> 12:36.179
I'll be on the lookout,
hella haunts out here.

12:36.262 --> 12:39.429
No, you right,
they all came out.
I saw Lawrence earlier.

12:39.512 --> 12:42.179
Well, I ain't afraid
of no ghosts.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.721
Fuck you, Qwantrell!
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you!

12:45.803 --> 12:48.512
Fuck you, Qwantrell!

12:48.596 --> 12:50.053
Wait.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.220
That ain't Qwantrell.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.887
- Phhht!
- Kelli.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.471
Hold this. I'm gonna holler at

12:54.554 --> 12:55.845
that Qwantrell-lookin'
motherfucker.

12:55.928 --> 12:58.095
- OK.
- How ya doin', baby? Sho'nuff?

12:58.179 --> 13:00.721
( laughing ) I didn't mean
"Fuck you," you know,

13:00.803 --> 13:02.887
I mean, "Hey,
what the fuck you doin'?"

13:06.137 --> 13:07.471
Why your hair so dusty?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.845
Nigga, you supposed
to put oil in that shit

13:09.928 --> 13:11.512
- before you come out in public.
- Hey.

13:11.596 --> 13:14.053
- What up, y'all.
- Look who finally made it.

13:14.137 --> 13:16.220
Make sure you claim
the seat behind me

13:16.304 --> 13:17.429
with that tall head of yours.

13:17.512 --> 13:19.512
( Fast Mike laughing )

13:19.596 --> 13:21.596
Oh, shit. ( laughs )

13:21.679 --> 13:24.596
Chad, nigga,
are you rockin' a purse?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.220
It's my fiancée purse.

13:26.304 --> 13:28.262
She didn't want to carry it
in the porta-potty.

13:28.345 --> 13:29.637
This bag real leather.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.387
Shit's expensive.
I know, 'cause I bought it.

13:31.471 --> 13:32.803
Balmain, like Beyoncé.

13:32.887 --> 13:34.887
Y'all hear Michelle
gettin' married too?

13:34.970 --> 13:37.803
- I'm happy for her.
- Leah took you back? How?

13:37.887 --> 13:40.596
- The fuck you mean, "how"?
- How'd she take
your cheatin' ass back?

13:40.679 --> 13:43.596
Disrespectful motherfucker.
Like you don't know
how love works.

13:43.679 --> 13:46.345
I did a thing,
she forgave that thing,
that's it.

13:46.429 --> 13:47.928
( laughs )
How is that it?

13:48.012 --> 13:49.887
What, the Lord just
led you back to Leah?

13:49.970 --> 13:52.887
I wasn't about to start this
couples shit all over again
with someone new.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.179
- What the fuck I look like?
- That's real.

13:55.262 --> 13:59.970
So you bought her
some flowers and a purse,
and then, boom, y'all good?

14:00.053 --> 14:04.095
No. No, he had to do
a lot of begging, groveling
and whatnot.

14:04.179 --> 14:05.471
Chad:
You don't know
what I been through.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.387
The aunties
I had to apologize to,

14:07.471 --> 14:08.721
smoothies I had to blend--

14:08.803 --> 14:10.012
Nigga, I done watched
so much "Project Runway"

14:10.095 --> 14:11.970
I could sew an A-line skirt.

14:12.053 --> 14:14.512
You did all of that,
and you still couldn't
leave her ass at home?

14:14.596 --> 14:16.721
It was worth it.
Head's still amazing.

14:16.803 --> 14:19.387
Don't tell her I said it,
but, nigga.

As you take your seats, I just

14:44.095 --> 14:45.887
You know she worked
with Tiffany.

14:45.970 --> 14:48.095
These events usually
white as fuck,

14:48.179 --> 14:50.887
but she actually made it
a blackbuster night.

14:50.970 --> 14:54.554
We really just wanted to

14:57.137 --> 14:58.928

Hey.

Long time.

15:25.845 --> 15:28.429
Yeah, long.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.471
Um... so, you a judge yet?

15:32.554 --> 15:34.387
( laughs )
Getting there.

15:34.471 --> 15:36.179
Order in the court!

15:38.387 --> 15:39.512
You?

15:39.596 --> 15:40.803
I'm good.

15:40.887 --> 15:42.679
I'm actually
regional manager now.

15:42.762 --> 15:44.179
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:44.262 --> 15:46.554
I'm still at Enterprise.
We still pick you up.

15:46.637 --> 15:49.471
- Unless I call a Lyft.
- Yeah.

15:49.554 --> 15:50.596
Don't, though.

15:50.679 --> 15:53.304
( both laugh )

15:55.137 --> 15:56.262
You look good.

15:56.345 --> 15:57.554
Yeah, you too.

15:57.637 --> 16:00.762
Hey, I'm headed
back to our blanket.

16:00.845 --> 16:02.429
All right, cool.
Yeah, I'll be there
in a second.

16:02.512 --> 16:04.179
- Yo, grab me a drink?
- Bet.

16:04.262 --> 16:06.137
All right.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.970
Um, so...

16:08.053 --> 16:10.345
So, good seeing you.
I gotta get back.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.845
Don't want to miss the beginning
of my favorite movie.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.262
Right. You didn't get anything
from the concession, though.

16:15.345 --> 16:19.554
Uh, you know what,
I forgot. I'm fasting.
Ramadan.

16:19.637 --> 16:22.345
I'm not Muslim,
but I still want
to respect it.

16:22.429 --> 16:24.471
- OK, well, great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too.

16:24.554 --> 16:26.679
- Good seeing you.
- Bye.

16:27.928 --> 16:29.970
- ( gasps )
- Yo! You good?

16:30.053 --> 16:31.721
- Yeah.
- You see a ghost or something?

16:31.803 --> 16:35.637
No. No, I just gotta
get back to my girls.

16:35.721 --> 16:37.887
Uh-- All right.

16:42.053 --> 16:45.220
Girl! I just saw Jared.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.721
Bitch, what?!

16:46.803 --> 16:48.220
- How he look?
- Gay!

16:48.304 --> 16:51.179
He was with some dude--
and he was fine, too--

16:51.262 --> 16:52.304
but I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it!

16:52.387 --> 16:54.596
Well, at least he's happy.

16:54.679 --> 16:57.095
Ugh. Here I was, all sad
for the longest,

16:57.179 --> 16:58.429
thinking that
I missed out on him.

16:58.512 --> 17:01.304
But my instincts were right
the whole time!

17:01.387 --> 17:03.137
That's so crazy.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.345
- ( movie starts )
- Oh, shit.

17:06.429 --> 17:08.596
( cheers, applause )

17:09.928 --> 17:11.970
Well, turns out
it was Qwantrell.

17:13.304 --> 17:15.053
Kelli:
Damnit.

17:15.137 --> 17:17.721
Now we're back together.

17:20.429 --> 17:23.845
How did you know
that was the cure?

17:23.928 --> 17:26.887
- This is the best part.
- You do not know.

17:26.970 --> 17:30.845
My ignorance, Master.
I will do anything
to prove my worthiness!

17:30.928 --> 17:32.179
My favorite! Thank you!

17:32.262 --> 17:34.012
- Happy birthday, Iss.
- Molly: Aww.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.554
Man:
Hey, sit your
big-ass head down!

17:36.637 --> 17:38.512
Issa:
Uh, oop.

17:38.596 --> 17:40.220
Lawrence:
He got the deep voice.

17:40.304 --> 17:42.637
( laughs )

17:42.721 --> 17:44.596
Hey, you know
this still hold up.

17:44.679 --> 17:47.304
It's sexist as fuck.

17:47.387 --> 17:49.345
- But I love it.
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.429 --> 17:51.179
- I do.
- Uh-huh.

17:51.262 --> 17:54.471
So what's up with you?
How's the event going?

17:54.554 --> 17:55.762
I'm good...

17:55.845 --> 17:59.803
but the event's
kinda on hold.

17:59.887 --> 18:02.179
Oh, for real?

18:02.262 --> 18:04.137
I thought you were
onto something.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.679
Yeah, it just got
to be a lot.

18:07.762 --> 18:10.012
It got hard. Like, I got
so many rejections.

18:12.137 --> 18:14.596
It just seemed like
it wasn't gonna work out.

18:16.845 --> 18:20.471
But you know, I'm just trying
to make the right choices.

18:20.554 --> 18:23.887
( movie dialogue continues,
indistinct )

18:23.970 --> 18:25.596
Yeah, I feel ya.

18:25.679 --> 18:30.095
It's a return
to the beginning...

18:30.179 --> 18:31.596
Yo, I should
probably get back

18:31.679 --> 18:33.721
before Fast Mike
eat all my taquitos.

18:33.803 --> 18:36.637
- Mm. He stay hungry. Hurry up.
- Yeah.

18:36.721 --> 18:38.262
I'm gonna tell him
you said that.

18:38.345 --> 18:39.679
Don't!
( laughs )

18:40.845 --> 18:42.429
- Oh, thank you. Again.
- Yeah.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.887
Happy birthday.

18:44.970 --> 18:46.220
Man:
You ain't a window, nigga!

18:46.304 --> 18:47.471
All right. My bad, bruh.

18:52.762 --> 18:54.596

18:54.679 --> 18:57.012
will you break through
the wall of mystery

18:57.095 --> 18:58.637

19:15.471 --> 19:17.637
Oh, shit! Guys, be cool.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.304

19:25.887 --> 19:28.220
Oh, these are my friends.

19:28.304 --> 19:30.137

19:30.220 --> 19:33.803
and his girl, and this

19:33.887 --> 19:37.053

- Kelli: So much fun!

19:48.053 --> 19:50.887
Such a great time.
Thank you, guys,
for a great birthday.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.637
You're welcome, girl.

19:52.721 --> 19:54.762
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.220
- Hey.
- Hi!

19:58.304 --> 20:00.721
- I'm Issa. We met at--
- Tiffany's baby shower.

20:00.803 --> 20:02.345
Yeah! Thanks for coming out.

20:02.429 --> 20:05.679
Oh, my God, this was so dope.
How did you pull this off?

20:05.762 --> 20:07.345
Oh, girl, it was a headache.

20:07.429 --> 20:09.262
The venue has their own way
of doing things,

20:09.345 --> 20:11.262
but I just had
to be persistent.

20:11.345 --> 20:13.053
- Yeah.
- But I was like,

20:13.137 --> 20:16.137
black people want this,
and need this,
and... here we are.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.637
You know, I was trying
to do something similar
in Inglewood,

20:19.721 --> 20:22.928
and it just got
mad overwhelming.

20:23.012 --> 20:25.179
I just felt like
I kept getting
nothing but...

20:25.262 --> 20:26.928
- No's.
- Yes!

20:27.012 --> 20:29.554
Very familiar with no's.

20:29.637 --> 20:32.262
But I just focused on
turning them into yes's,

20:32.345 --> 20:34.803
or at least, "OK, fine,
just leave me alone."

20:34.887 --> 20:37.512
( both laugh )

20:37.596 --> 20:40.262
- Thank you again.
- Thanks for coming out, really.

20:40.345 --> 20:43.762
- I'm just gonna take one.
- You got it. ( laughs )

20:57.137 --> 20:59.179
Ha ha! So now
you got the memo.

21:03.970 --> 21:07.471

give my idea another shot.

The block party?

Oh, we back on that?

21:11.512 --> 21:13.345
Girl, what is goin' on?

21:13.429 --> 21:16.095
I don't know, I just got
a lot of positive signs lately,

21:16.179 --> 21:19.095
and you were
just saying earlier
to trust my instincts.

21:19.179 --> 21:21.887
Nah, I definitely said
trust my  instincts.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.762
- Oh, your instincts?
- Mm-hmm.

21:23.845 --> 21:26.762
Didn't you just
run into your
gay-but-not-really-gay ex?

21:26.845 --> 21:28.596
- Those instincts?
- Yeah, those same ones.

21:28.679 --> 21:30.095
Whatever, girl.

21:30.179 --> 21:32.012
Brother, lover--
they all the same.

21:32.095 --> 21:33.554
I'm just tryin' to help.

21:33.637 --> 21:36.220
Didn't I just help
plan you a bomb birthday,

21:36.304 --> 21:37.803
- You did.
- bomb movie,

21:37.887 --> 21:39.262
and bomb nigga control.

21:39.345 --> 21:43.179
Mm-kay? What niggas
you controllin'?

21:43.262 --> 21:44.637
That nigga Nathan?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.679
Girl, he showed up
at your house

21:46.762 --> 21:49.762
with some whack-ass flowers
like nothing ever happened.

21:49.845 --> 21:52.637
I was so mad for you.
( laughs )

21:52.721 --> 21:53.970
Wait, what?

21:54.053 --> 21:55.928
Nathan came to my  house?

21:56.012 --> 21:58.137
Yeah. Like right before
I picked you up.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.596
And I sent his ass on the way
with the quickness.

22:00.679 --> 22:04.053
I wasn't about to let him
ruin your birthday, girl.

22:05.803 --> 22:08.387
I'm sorry.

22:08.471 --> 22:11.053
Why didn't you
just tell me?

22:11.137 --> 22:14.345
You said you didn't
want no drama on your 30th.

22:14.429 --> 22:15.554
So, you're welcome.

22:15.637 --> 22:18.095
Girl, what the fuck?!
Why--

22:18.179 --> 22:20.679
You shoulda just told me
and let me handle it myself!

22:20.762 --> 22:23.637
Oh. Like how you handled
going over to his house?

22:23.721 --> 22:25.387
Bitch, you had me lookin' dumb

22:25.471 --> 22:27.304
while you was over there
playing Harriet the Spy.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.387
Look, I know you were
trying to help,

22:29.471 --> 22:32.345
but bitch, I'm not you,
I don't cancel niggas
left and right.

22:32.429 --> 22:35.512
Oh. Well, when a bitch is right,
a bitch is right.

22:35.596 --> 22:37.512
I'm sorry, what?

22:37.596 --> 22:40.512
- Ohh.
- You been with some
real negative shit lately,

22:40.596 --> 22:44.053
bitch, like you keep assuming
the worst in everybody,

22:44.137 --> 22:45.928
like homie from your job,
for example,

22:46.012 --> 22:47.512
you just came for him
out of nowhere--

22:47.596 --> 22:49.345
Girl, it was not
out of nowhere.

22:49.429 --> 22:52.053
I don't wanna be
like every other woman
in my office,

22:52.137 --> 22:53.262
stalled out at associate.

22:53.345 --> 22:56.179
So yeah, this is just
how I have to be.

22:56.262 --> 22:58.179
Is it?

22:58.262 --> 23:00.345

I was just comin' to see you
about the METRA case.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.679
Are you thinking
we do state laws first,

23:43.762 --> 23:46.387
or federal, 'cause if so,
then you take one,
and I take the other--

23:46.471 --> 23:48.845
That's on you now.
You don't need me.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.762
( laughs ) What?

23:50.845 --> 23:54.095
( short laugh ) Molly,
you're more than capable
of handling this on your own.

23:54.179 --> 23:56.345
Well, I appreciate that,
but honestly, I think--

23:56.429 --> 23:58.803
I'm joining
the Rivers harassment case.

24:00.845 --> 24:03.596
Well, then who's
gonna be my co-lead?

24:03.679 --> 24:05.554
I told Frank you got it.

24:09.845 --> 24:11.387
Oh, hey, Molly.

24:11.471 --> 24:13.637
Congrats on landing the lead
on METRA.

24:15.803 --> 24:17.345
Thank you.

24:24.512 --> 24:26.803
OK then, bye.

24:37.262 --> 24:39.637
I know some great vendors
that would love
to work with us.

24:39.721 --> 24:41.387

- Heck, yes.

24:41.471 --> 24:42.887
That's so dope!

24:42.970 --> 24:45.012
I just wish we could get
a really big headliner.

24:45.095 --> 24:47.095
What do you mean, "wish"?
We are.

24:47.179 --> 24:48.970
I'll set up a meeting
at Rock Nation.

24:49.053 --> 24:51.803
- I know their A&R guy.

24:51.887 --> 24:54.345

for meeting up with me.

24:54.429 --> 24:57.429
It's been so helpful to have
someone to bounce ideas off of.

24:57.512 --> 25:00.345
Absolutely.
And I know it's not easy,
what you're doing,

25:00.429 --> 25:01.928
but I really like
the sound of it

25:02.012 --> 25:03.637

Right.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.304
Yeah. Um...

26:37.387 --> 26:40.220
So I've come to the conclusion

26:40.304 --> 26:43.179
that I do not always assume
the best in people...

26:46.387 --> 26:51.429
...and, um, and I've kinda been
in a selfish space lately.

26:51.512 --> 26:53.220

26:53.304 --> 26:56.137
hurt me a lot more
than I realized.

26:56.220 --> 26:59.012
And I've been taking that out
on other people.

26:59.095 --> 27:02.262
And it's no excuse.
I just wanted to say, um,

27:02.345 --> 27:03.887

to take off like that.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.095
You didn't deserve it.

28:43.179 --> 28:46.637
I was MIA because I went back
to Houston for a bit.

28:46.721 --> 28:50.887
I was just dealin' with...
a lot of shit.

28:50.970 --> 28:54.053
And, you know, I don't...

28:54.137 --> 28:58.304
know how to explain it,
but sometimes I just,

28:58.387 --> 29:01.637
I get, like, really down

29:01.721 --> 29:04.845

29:04.928 --> 29:06.387

29:06.471 --> 29:09.554
I just can't talk
to people sometimes.

29:09.637 --> 29:12.471
And I didn't want
to put you through that.

29:16.887 --> 29:20.721
So you... ghosted me
and left L.A.

29:20.803 --> 29:23.471
because you were
in a bad mood?

29:23.554 --> 29:25.262
No, I--

29:25.345 --> 29:28.596
No, I-- Yeah, I know
that's fucked up.

29:28.679 --> 29:32.637
It's, um, I just wasn't
thinkin' straight.

29:32.721 --> 29:36.012
And I wish I had,

29:36.095 --> 29:38.345
like, a better explanation,

29:38.429 --> 29:40.845
but that's the truth.
