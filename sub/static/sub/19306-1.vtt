00:26.400 --> 00:27.696
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.280
We are on our final approach
for Seattle.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.033
The weather is fair,
with winds out of the east.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.351
The temperature on the ground,
68 degrees.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.954
On behalf of our cabin crew,
and us here on the flight deck,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.793
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us tonight.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.276
Life sucks
when you can't sleep.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.599
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.119
Sometimes it's good to talk.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.873
Okay.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.793
This is gonna sound crazy,

01:09.160 --> 01:11.515
but you ever hear about
the videotape that kills you

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
after you watch it?

01:18.360 --> 01:19.679
Well, I'm at this party,

01:19.760 --> 01:21.113
and I meet this girl
from Seattle.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.913
We totally hit it off.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.870
The next day she sends me this
video that says, "Watch me."

01:27.000 --> 01:29.389
So, I find a VCR,

01:29.560 --> 01:30.879
watch it,

01:32.200 --> 01:35.112
but the images on it...

01:36.640 --> 01:39.279
The second it was over,
my phone rings.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.517
And this girl says
I'm gonna die in seven days.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.835
That was a week ago tonight.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.920
Ever since,
everything's been strange.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.834
All I got to do is make it
through the next five minutes.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.068
As a reminder...

02:05.160 --> 02:06.309
God. I'm sorry.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.856
Sir! Sir,
please stay in your seat.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.161
Please remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Sir!

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
What was that about?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.195
That cute guy
sitting right next to us...

02:18.280 --> 02:19.918
It turns out
he's a total head case.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.675
And he was telling me about a
movie that's supposed to kill you.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.480
What movie?

02:27.560 --> 02:28.595
Some video.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.989
A chick calls you
on the phone after you watch it

02:31.080 --> 02:32.149
and says, "Seven days,"

02:32.240 --> 02:33.639
which was, like, right now.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
Open up!

02:46.520 --> 02:47.839
Did you make a copy of it?

02:48.480 --> 02:49.720
Did you make
a copy of the tape?

02:49.760 --> 02:50.909
No! I...

02:51.000 --> 02:52.016
Miss,
the seat belt light is on.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Oh, Jesus.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.880
What is going on with you?
It's just a story.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.792
I've seen it!

02:59.280 --> 03:00.952
Traffic control,
this is Flight 77.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.031
We have some
signal interference.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.840
If you're not interested in
buying, I'd love to take a look.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.190
Sure. I mean,
who would want an old VCR?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.833
Well, once upon a time, this
was a technological revolution.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.548
Okay.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.679
Just talking to the guy.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.959
It turns out that
he got all this stuff from

04:51.160 --> 04:54.311
a family whose son died
in a plane crash a couple of years back.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.753
And now it's just a bunch
of outdated junk.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.159
I prefer "vintage."

05:10.640 --> 05:12.358
Come on, old man.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.673
You still got
some life in you.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.069
Hey, Skye?

05:35.120 --> 05:36.314
Guess what.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.519
What?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.079
Had a tape in it.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.191
Care to see
what's down the rabbit hole?

05:44.320 --> 05:46.231
I'm gonna be late
for class.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.799
But then, maybe
you can tell me about it later.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Have fun, Professor.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.630
Come on, work.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.509
Hello?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.516
Seven days.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.239
What? Who is this?

08:50.720 --> 08:51.948
Julia.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.754
I keep thinking
about this story.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.677
It's, like, the most romantic
story in the history of stories.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.077
Well, it's not how we met.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.994
No.
It's about this guy, Orpheus.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.629
His girlfriend dies
and he has to literally go down into Hell

09:09.720 --> 09:11.153
to rescue her.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.275
How come it's always the guy
rescuing the girl?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.399
Just...

09:17.600 --> 09:20.797
He tracks her down.
All right? He finds her.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.395
And the Devil's gonna
let her go on one condition.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.672
He has to start first,
without her.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.435
He has to walk away
without looking back at her.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.438
- But...
- He looks back to glimpse her

09:33.520 --> 09:35.750
and loses her forever.
Ninth grade.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.271
- English Lit.
- Okay. You know it.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.192
So, what's your point?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.116
I don't know. I just...

09:44.200 --> 09:45.952
I relate to the guy.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.399
I mean, I can't imagine
not looking back at you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.638
Actually, you got to go.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.296
Because my boyfriend's
leaving for college,

10:03.320 --> 10:05.550
and I promised
I'd help him pack.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.834
- No!
- Come on, get up.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.599
Baby, baby,
baby, he's a loser. Come back to bed.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.318
Come back to bed, now.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.389
You really need all this?

10:21.480 --> 10:22.480
Yeah.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.237
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.995
Come on, Holt!

10:28.080 --> 10:29.600
Supposed to be on the road
an hour ago.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.193
Just give us
a second, Dad.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.033
You're doing
the right thing.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.672
Your mom, she really
needs you right now.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.477
I'm gonna miss your smell.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.874
Really?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.229
Yeah.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.114
Okay.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.798
I'll see you
Columbus Day weekend.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.714
And tell Tommy Lombardi
that I'm on to him.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.915
What do you mean?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.230
He gets a job where you work
the day I leave?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.195
You're crazy!

11:14.280 --> 11:15.474
Don't look back!

11:17.040 --> 11:18.800
9:30, Skype, tonight!

11:18.880 --> 11:20.074
Where the hell
is your shirt?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
Tonight!

11:21.280 --> 11:22.315
And every night!

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
And every single night!

11:23.800 --> 11:26.075
Unless I'm with
Tommy Lombardi!

11:28.160 --> 11:30.435
You did not
just say that!

11:38.960 --> 11:42.509
Oh, baby,
it's been six weeks. I can't take it.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.670
Why are you so much nicer now

11:44.760 --> 11:46.830
that we don't live
in the same town?

11:47.480 --> 11:48.959
Sorry, what's your name again?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.951
- Shut up.
- That's a weird name.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.679
How are your classes?

11:53.840 --> 11:56.195
Kind of uninspiring.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.511
There's this
one Experimental Biology class, though.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.840
The teacher's kind of a badass.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.759
That sounds cool.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.395
Yeah.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.233
Not everything's cool, though.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.709
It's still, like,
a whole week until I get to see you.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.758
Well, you're seeing me now.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.757
Yeah, I guess.

12:14.840 --> 12:19.595
What about I start
by taking off my hairclip?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.798
Oh!

12:22.840 --> 12:24.956
Yeah. Uh, okay.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.835
What's next?

12:35.160 --> 12:37.000
"Oh, take me, take me.
I can't stand it!"

12:37.080 --> 12:38.416
How did you even
get in here?

12:38.440 --> 12:40.112
These idiots just
broke into my room.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.233
Come on, Vision Quest.
Gabriel says you're up.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.355
Let's go to the 7s.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.317
- Shit. Tonight?
- Tonight.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.709
Sorry, little lady,
but boyfriend's got plans tonight.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.816
You know,
but we could talk.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.114
I think I'm good.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.520
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.720
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- He'll talk to you...

12:58.640 --> 13:00.198
Yeah, sure.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.756
I told you
I'd make it up to you.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.394
Julia...

14:45.280 --> 14:46.759
You owe me a good dream.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.957
- Where is he?
- Who are you?

14:50.080 --> 14:51.080
Where's Holt?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.696
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him in days.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.720
Don't lie to me!

14:53.800 --> 14:54.949
I'm not lying to you!

14:55.080 --> 14:56.440
What are you
doing on his computer?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.988
Tell him there's no hiding.
Tell the dead man he can't hide.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.833
What... What are you talking
about? What's wrong with you?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.113
She's coming.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.918
There's no stopping her.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
Tell Holt that...

15:18.280 --> 15:20.714
Please pick up the phone.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.040
This is Holt.
You know what to...

15:45.880 --> 15:47.616
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.360
Holt, what's going on?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.436
I just had the strangest
conversation in my life

15:51.520 --> 15:52.714
with that weird girl.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.160
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.953
Hello?

17:54.280 --> 17:56.475
Science has told us
that we are merely

17:56.560 --> 18:01.509
the primal stirrings of
some carbon, some proteins.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.318
We live a while, eat,

18:05.400 --> 18:06.549
have sex, when we can.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.476
And that's it,
then we die.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.549
Lewin, there's no need
to take notes on that part.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.518
But wait, hold on,

18:16.600 --> 18:20.195
because no one is denying
that we have consciousness.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.948
Some inner life
that's not quite accounted for here.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.795
Let's remember the infamous
double-slit experiment.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.555
When no one is watching,

18:30.640 --> 18:34.269
the particles just pass
through both slits at the same time.

18:34.360 --> 18:38.478
But with an observer,
they behave like bullets,

18:39.360 --> 18:41.874
passing through
one slit or the other.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.437
This is big, guys.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.276
The immaterial
human consciousness

18:47.360 --> 18:49.999
has reached out
and touched the material.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.637
There is a calculable
transformation in the real world,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.519
and solely because

18:56.480 --> 18:58.277
someone was there
to watch it.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.072
Which may account
for the fact

19:02.200 --> 19:04.998
that I have become
significantly sweatier once I've noticed

19:05.160 --> 19:08.596
the mysterious stranger watching
me from the back of the room.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.511
All right, that's it.
Go get drunk.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.792
Hey, I remember
you guys from...

19:27.880 --> 19:29.400
- Why'd you come here?
- Come on, dude.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.192
Move it along. There you go.
There you go.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.749
How can I help you?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.798
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.279
He's supposed to
be in your class.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.276
Okay.
What's this guy's name?

19:50.360 --> 19:51.793
Holt Anthony.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.394
Yeah.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.873
Not sure.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.280
It always takes me
until Thanksgiving

19:59.320 --> 20:01.356
to start putting
names to faces.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.032
Really? 'Cause

20:03.760 --> 20:07.594
he was supposed to do some sort
of extra credit thing for you.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
Did he?

20:11.520 --> 20:13.795
Maybe. I don't know.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.874
I do know that
I have 25 essays to grade.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.159
Listen. Okay.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.557
It's not uncommon for a new
student to find something or someone

20:25.920 --> 20:28.354
that's more interesting
to them than class.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.310
My advice to you?
Move on.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.440
Calm down.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.776
I'm telling you,
it's different.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.633
Everyone says that.
It's okay. Where's your tail?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.438
I don't have
one anymore.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.896
I told you
not to call him.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.911
That asshole
hung up on me!

23:52.000 --> 23:53.399
I wonder why.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.675
Okay. We'll switch tails.
You talk to Holt?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.878
No! I tried.
He isn't answering his phone.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.632
- Come on.
- Holt has his own problems.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.239
You have to help me, Gabriel.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.496
It's your fault!
You started this!

24:03.520 --> 24:04.635
Calm down.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.229
Listen to me, Gabe!

24:07.320 --> 24:09.470
The videos,
the tails, all these people.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.434
- It's wrong and she's pissed!
- You're being ridiculous.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.159
I can feel her.
It's all changing.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.394
You don't have much time.
You need to trust me.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.072
How could I
ever trust you?

24:20.160 --> 24:22.176
Get to your studio.
Don't talk to anyone along the way.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.713
Make a copy of
the video and wait.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.872
I'm gonna send
someone right now. Hey, hey, hey!

24:28.240 --> 24:31.277
Everything's gonna
be fine, darling. You understand?

24:31.360 --> 24:33.794
Yes! I understand!

24:35.000 --> 24:36.797
But you don't.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.274
I honestly didn't find the
tape to be that scary, but...

24:54.360 --> 24:56.874
Oh. Hey, you're not
supposed to be here!

25:01.000 --> 25:02.149
Hey!

25:02.560 --> 25:04.198
You called me
the other night.

25:04.840 --> 25:05.875
Hey! Look at me.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.354
You're the girlfriend.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.875
Where's Holt?

25:14.920 --> 25:16.638
I... I can help you.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.791
But I need to show you
something first.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.994
You live here?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.911
Yeah. Fine Arts.
Grad program.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.759
I need a clear head
to do my work, and I like my privacy.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.435
Is Holt even here?

25:49.920 --> 25:51.672
Did I say he would be?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.080
Be careful where you step.
I just painted the ceiling.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.194
Nothing's wrong.
He's not avoiding you.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.831
He's just on a journey.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.000
I want you to watch something
and then you'll understand.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.156
- Is that my phone?
- You're lying!

27:16.560 --> 27:18.755
I need you to do this for me.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.751
It's just a two-minute video.
It won't hurt you.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.789
Open the door!

27:32.160 --> 27:35.038
Julia! I need you to help me.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.233
Holt watched it.
We've all watched it.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.315
Open the door!

28:00.080 --> 28:01.274
You're not real.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.873
You're not real!

28:16.120 --> 28:17.473
7:10.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.999
I win, bitch.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.240
Jules!

32:36.320 --> 32:37.753
What happened?
What happened?

32:37.840 --> 32:39.671
Tell me you didn't watch it.
Tell me!

32:39.760 --> 32:42.069
She's dead.
She's dead. She's dead.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.754
Hello?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.596
Uh... Gabriel sent me.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.398
I'm supposed to watch a video.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.275
Hello.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.078
Gabriel. Gabriel.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.268
Do you know about Skye?

33:08.120 --> 33:10.998
I know.
Someone put a picture of her online.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.638
Everyone's dropping out.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.234
Wait.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.399
Wait.
Do I still have a tail?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.115
Gabriel?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.320
Is someone still
watching for me?

33:32.800 --> 33:34.496
I'm gonna find you someone,
I promise you that.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.873
Just stay where you are.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.113
Who was that?

33:47.360 --> 33:49.078
It was Gabriel.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.992
Everything's gonna
be fine.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.911
That's what
he told Skye.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.390
Listen, Julia.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.916
I'm really sorry that
you had to see that.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.836
But I can't let you
get caught up in this.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.911
I think it's a little
too late for that.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.518
I watched it.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.438
Twelve hours
after Skye.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.596
We were supposed to
help each other through it.

34:14.679 --> 34:15.908
"Help each other"?

34:19.880 --> 34:20.915
Yeah.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.797
- So were you and her...
- No.

34:23.199 --> 34:27.318
Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be
chosen for this experiment.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.589
If you just heard
the way he described it.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.592
That we could prove
the existence of a soul.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.318
Of life after death.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.190
I know.
I know. It sounds crazy,

34:40.280 --> 34:42.475
but I'm just...

34:45.120 --> 34:48.157
The tape is the doorway
to the other side.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.712
Then why did she die?

34:56.600 --> 34:59.672
You have seven days
before you die.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.712
You just have
to watch the tape and make a copy,

35:03.800 --> 35:04.856
and show it
to someone else.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.313
And then you're fine.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.558
Gabriel calls it a "tail."

35:09.760 --> 35:11.398
Her tail just didn't show.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.796
So were you
supposed to pass on a death sentence

35:14.880 --> 35:15.915
to someone else?

35:21.080 --> 35:23.275
How could you get
involved in this?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.560
Please.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.038
Whatever you are,

36:54.840 --> 36:55.875
leave him alone.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.317
Seven days.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.233
Jules. What did you do?

38:53.440 --> 38:54.714
I saw something.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.314
There was a room. A door.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.115
Yeah.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.673
It's Gabriel.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.872
Holt, listen.
I've got a tail for you.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.558
It's not for me anymore.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.748
You know why I wasn't
answering your calls, right?

39:30.720 --> 39:33.234
It was to
protect you from this.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.830
Gabriel had a solution
for me.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.831
It would have been fine.
I would have been fine.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.919
Then I'll be fine, too.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.635
Jules!

40:01.480 --> 40:02.629
What happened?

40:03.760 --> 40:05.079
A bird.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.873
There was a bird.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.754
Julia!

40:24.960 --> 40:27.838
See? I told you
there was a bird.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.678
Julia!

40:43.400 --> 40:44.799
But I saw it.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.195
So you watched the tape.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.993
And I had
dismissed self-sacrifice as popular myth.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.832
Holt was running out
of time.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.351
It was the only way
to save him.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.516
Anyone would have done it.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.356
You know,
I could show you some research

41:33.440 --> 41:35.476
that would
suggest the opposite.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.873
She's marked already.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.713
On day one.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.794
And it's... It's different.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.075
I wasn't marked
until day five.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.310
Gabriel,
this has to mean something.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.350
It's happening faster.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.552
Maybe it is all changing.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.549
I wanted to believe that tape
meant a lot of things.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.478
That our souls are eternal,

42:06.640 --> 42:08.392
and when we die,

42:09.280 --> 42:11.953
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.918
Then I saw the picture.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.872
I saw Skye's face.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.992
You saw it, too.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.708
You want to survive, you make a
copy and you show someone.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.239
No one is dying
because of me.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.634
I'll tell them how it works.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.911
And so what?
The cycle just continues?

42:36.400 --> 42:38.595
What do you think
survival is?

42:39.440 --> 42:40.440
Just make a copy.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.750
We'll decide what
to do with it later.

42:48.680 --> 42:49.908
Please.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.274
What did you do here?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.831
Uh, her version won't copy.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.831
What do you mean
"it won't copy"?

43:42.240 --> 43:45.038
Your file size is
larger than the original.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.839
How can that be?

43:47.400 --> 43:48.674
Scrub through her copy.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.556
Ooh, what is that?
Go back.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.634
Right there!

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
The bird.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.274
I told you in the car
I saw that bird.

44:07.480 --> 44:08.595
What?

44:11.760 --> 44:13.034
It shouldn't be there.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.193
I need my equipment.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.995
Okay. See, there's these
weird gaps in the digital code.

44:52.720 --> 44:56.315
Glitches where we get
these ghost images, like your bird.

44:56.400 --> 45:00.234
I mean, we're talking
one or two frame still images,

45:00.320 --> 45:02.390
but there's more.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.711
There's video data condensed
in the still frames.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.073
A video within the video?

45:08.480 --> 45:11.074
Well, there is now.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.316
I don't want you
to watch it.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.992
Jules, there's no way.

45:25.800 --> 45:28.792
We're watching this together.
End of discussion.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.434
Holt, whatever it is,
I think it's intended for Julia alone.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.039
Look at me.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.077
I know you're upset
that I watched it.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.715
But we can't let it be
for nothing.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.556
So don't look back, okay?

46:05.760 --> 46:06.795
Put it on.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.520
Jules?

46:41.440 --> 46:43.431
Baby, tell us
what you see.

46:47.960 --> 46:49.518
A clock.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.117
A cross in a flood.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.874
A girl.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.359
Jules.

47:09.720 --> 47:10.869
Jules?

47:13.520 --> 47:14.714
I don't know.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.713
A burning body.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.388
Jules!

47:34.280 --> 47:36.350
Sorry. I, um...

47:38.680 --> 47:40.079
What was it?

47:41.720 --> 47:46.475
Only images,
but I can't explain how it felt.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.918
Flood.
Fire. Cremation.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.992
Those are images
that have never been on the tape before.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.637
You know,
primitive cultures believed

47:58.720 --> 48:00.392
that the only way
to free a soul

48:00.520 --> 48:02.033
is to burn the body.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.076
That is,
if you can find it.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.388
Wait.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.273
I saw this.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.396
That's where
they buried her.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.111
I traced it to a town
called Sacrament Valley,

48:21.200 --> 48:23.156
about four hours from here.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.751
That's where
we need to go.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.675
Hello.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.840
Ah. Thank you, Jamal.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.030
The police are
on their way here.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.872
And you're not
even coming with us!

48:56.960 --> 48:59.315
The police want to
ask me questions, Holt.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.833
They think
you killed Skye.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
But you didn't.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.230
I hope if you learn
anything from an education,

49:04.320 --> 49:06.197
it's that more than
one theory can be true.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.599
I didn't kill Skye.

49:09.560 --> 49:10.993
And I did.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.275
But the cops don't deal
in such ambiguities.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.593
My research.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.717
Everything that's known
about the tape is in there.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.956
It'll be more of a help to you
than I can be.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.473
A man never quite
measures up to his work.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.873
The images on the tape,
they were her story.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.031
She wanted it to be heard.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.598
"Samara was found abandoned
as a young child.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.509
"No one knew where she came
from or who her parents were.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.636
"She was adopted,
and they realized

50:09.720 --> 50:11.520
"that something was unnatural
about this girl.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.234
"Something evil.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.439
"They tried to kill her,

50:20.040 --> 50:24.192
"but Samara survived for seven
days at the bottom of the well.

50:25.880 --> 50:29.475
"They found her body
years later."

50:30.320 --> 50:32.834
And they brought her
all the way to this town?

50:32.920 --> 50:34.148
Why?

50:35.720 --> 50:37.676
I don't know.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.440
That girl.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.753
What girl?

51:34.720 --> 51:35.835
Hello?

51:48.880 --> 51:50.154
Hello?

51:55.080 --> 51:56.195
Can I help you?

51:56.280 --> 51:57.315
Hey, uh...

51:58.560 --> 52:01.472
There was no light outside.
Do you have any vacancies?

52:03.200 --> 52:04.235
Two rooms?

52:04.680 --> 52:05.680
One.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.593
Cash only.
Checkout's at noon.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.196
It's an old house.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.679
Walls are thin.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.837
Hope you don't mind the cats.

52:18.440 --> 52:19.668
I'm just down the hall.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.634
Excuse me.
Who's the girl in this photo?

52:23.720 --> 52:24.835
The one
in the middle there?

52:25.680 --> 52:27.477
Why, that's my niece.

52:27.680 --> 52:29.830
Beautiful, isn't she?
People say we look just...

52:29.920 --> 52:32.832
No, I'm sorry.
I meant the girl with the violin.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.480
Oh. That's Evelyn.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.280
I think I saw her.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.794
Earlier today.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.112
That's not possible.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.551
She disappeared 30 years ago.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.471
Does anyone know why?

52:53.160 --> 52:54.275
No.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.195
And I'd rather
not talk about it.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.471
Ma'am,
where's the church?

53:01.560 --> 53:04.358
Well,
it's not a church anymore.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.790
That's when
I hit rock bottom.

53:09.880 --> 53:14.590
I guess the worst part of it
for me was that I let down my kids,

53:14.680 --> 53:15.680
I let down my husband.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.554
Raise your hand
if life ever let you down.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.356
Go ahead now, raise your hand.

53:26.080 --> 53:29.595
And then you found the drug
that you thought unlocked a secret.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.673
One day at a time.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.633
Thank you all for coming.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.597
I'll see you next week.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.314
Jules. We better go.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.956
So, what do we do now?

54:31.080 --> 54:34.629
Awful young to be here.
Don't let it kill you.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.799
Excuse me, sir!

54:38.840 --> 54:41.559
Could you tell me
a little bit more about the church?

54:41.640 --> 54:42.959
When did it close?

54:44.160 --> 54:45.479
Been 13 years.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.038
After the flood.

54:48.120 --> 54:51.157
Town used to have five times
this many people.

54:51.680 --> 54:52.829
Ever since,

54:53.320 --> 54:55.550
there's more dead
than alive around here.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.240
Thank you.

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
He said the church was...

55:00.960 --> 55:02.393
That's where
they brought her.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.029
The cemetery.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.352
Look for her name.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.800
Come on, pick up.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.716
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.518
Holt, it's Gabriel.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.936
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

56:13.960 --> 56:16.758
but I figured out
the mark on Julia's hand.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.513
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

56:40.560 --> 56:44.109
"The waters rose to carry them
and brought them back safely to God."

57:22.720 --> 57:23.720
Holt!

57:25.240 --> 57:26.309
Holt!

57:49.560 --> 57:51.357
Hey, hey, hey.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.393
She's in there.

58:17.880 --> 58:19.711
Someone moved her.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.473
Jules?

58:34.720 --> 58:36.039
What are you doing?

58:38.800 --> 58:40.313
There's writing.

59:01.040 --> 59:02.234
Holt.

59:08.040 --> 59:09.075
Holt!

59:56.880 --> 59:58.393
Julia!

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.016
Hey, what happened?
What happened?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.439
What happened?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.639
I saw something.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.474
The well.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.594
We were just looking...

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.999
I know
who you're looking for.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.148
Let's go.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.071
- What did you find?
- Two kids.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.518
Caught them
breaking into 294.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.836
Breaking in?

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.399
Well, that's new.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.296
You want me to
take them down to the Sheriff's Office?

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.436
No, no, no, no, no,
don't bother the Sheriff.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.033
I can take care of this.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.033
I'm Galen Burke.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.837
I watch over things here.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.953
So to speak.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.236
Please. Come in.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.519
It's not much.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.029
But I wasn't
expecting company.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.040
- I can... I can take...
- No, no. I'm fine, son.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.552
I know every corner
of this house.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.080
So,

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.833
you're looking
for the girl.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.197
I find it interesting

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.999
that you managed
to find her grave

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.355
even after
the marker was removed.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.788
I had a vision.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.672
An image of that grave
that led me here.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.870
And inside the grave,

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.232
I saw a vision
of a well.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.074
A vision.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.079
So, you want to know
about Samara Morgan.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.909
Our priest was very active
with the community back then.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.629
He heard that after
all the little girl had been through

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.230
that she was being denied
a resting place.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.516
Well, who's to say that charity isn't
meant for the dead?

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.117
So why isn't she
there now?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.429
Well, because we paid
mightily for this act of charity.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.868
It was as if God and nature
itself wanted us to be rid of her.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.189
The flood.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.349
Yes.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.670
But I had
let myself believe,

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.719
like you,

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.229
that she was trying
to tell me something.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.237
I was pulled
to that grave.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.549
She showed me things.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.715
Things that no one
should have to imagine.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.037
And then I went blind.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
I'm so sorry.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.513
No, don't be.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.355
It brought me peace.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.068
The priest requested
that her body be moved.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.310
He left Sacrament Valley.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.719
She was buried in
a potter's field just north of town,

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.870
to be forgotten by all.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.033
I think we should
get out of here.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.394
Listen to me.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.233
There is nothing
about that girl

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.197
that's worth
being curious about.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.632
I need to see this through.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.994
Why?

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.480
Because you think
you were chosen for something?

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.555
Having a vision

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.313
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.153
Thank you.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.392
What's this on your hand?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.920
Why did you put this mark
on your hand?

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.799
What do you mean?

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.829
Be careful.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.949
You hear me?

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.388
So, what now?

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.754
We gotta find the body.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.595
What?

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.159
Hey, stay right there.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.590
This road's closed.
There's been an accident.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.637
- Need you to turn it around.
- Okay, sir.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.279
- Julia!
- It's that girl.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.674
From the picture.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.080
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going, sir?

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.551
Excuse me. Turn around.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.595
Stop!

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.309
Evelyn!

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.229
Stop!

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.029
Gabriel?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
Oh, Gabriel.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.029
Over here!

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.360
- He needs help!
- Hey!

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Gabriel.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.115
What is it?

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.674
Hey, sir! Please!

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.197
Gabriel, tell me.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.719
You can't be down there!

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.400
Julia!

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.874
He was coming
for a reason.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.151
He wanted to
tell us something.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.836
No, she wanted to
tell us something.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.635
This girl has something
to do with Samara.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.439
We need to go back.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.396
I can feel her pain,
her suffering.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.760
I'm sick with it
and it's getting worse.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.758
I'm so tired.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.193
Then you sleep.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.436
I'm gonna get us
something to eat.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.669
Okay.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.189
Look.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.117
We'll figure this out.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:47.679
I was right there.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.668
There you go,
Karen.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.672
Chicken fried
steak and coffee.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.909
Hey. Menu?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.513
Yeah. Sure.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.910
So, what is that?
Chicken or steak?

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.079
You're funny.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.439
Look, I...

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.598
I don't mean to
be rude, but, uh...

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.553
The girl who's friends with your
niece, the one who disappeared...

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.512
Can you tell me
a little bit more about what happened?

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.310
My niece and she

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.834
knew each other through
the church music program.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.910
But she was the most gifted.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.473
People used to kid her,
"You're too good for this place.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.438
"We're gonna wake up one day
and you'll be gone, and that'll be that."

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.115
I guess there's certain jokes
you shouldn't make

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.599
because it happened.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.838
She disappeared.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.593
No clothes gone. No note.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.240
Just vanished.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.040
Ah!

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.915
The priest.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.878
He kept you down here.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.319
The child!

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.356
Thirty-four weeks.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.631
Eight and a half months.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.198
You were pregnant.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.557
You were Samara's mother.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.275
The police investigated
for six months,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.119
and then we stopped
hearing from them.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.953
Town never felt
quite the same after that.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.879
The priest.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.680
Do you know
what happened to him?

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.433
He still lives in town.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.959
Although he isn't
a priest anymore.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.712
Not since
he went blind.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.950
I have to go.
Uh, excuse me.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.909
Mr. Burke!

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.634
It's Julia!
I have to talk to you!

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.072
The boy's not with you.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.909
What's wrong?

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.395
I think I understand
my visions.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.509
The things
she's been showing me.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.316
I need to know
about the priest.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.794
I guess, just like
most people in the town,

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.914
the event sort of
took it out of him.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.477
I just don't see
why it matters.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.356
There was a girl
here 30 years ago who disappeared.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.233
I've seen her.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.828
Evelyn Borden.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.713
You knew her?

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.639
Everyone knew Evelyn.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.430
She was kept
under the church.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.432
I found a room.
It was like a prison.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.029
There were days
marked off on the walls.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.394
Nine months.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.198
She's Samara's mother.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.753
She suffered from
the day she was born.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.795
And she's still
suffering now.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.518
I think I understand it.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.798
This curse. This.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.510
It will never stop
until she's free.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.993
What's that sound?

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.913
Cicadas.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.709
Burke.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.473
Jules?

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.789
Jules!

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.469
Julia...

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.795
I know what it's like
to be guided by visions.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.995
To be certain.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.753
I was certain
that I would father

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.150
a child that
was gonna change the world.

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.993
And I was right.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.671
You see, Julia,

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.191
she didn't take my sight.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.589
I did.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.679
Good girl.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.194
You're very brave.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.396
You're Samara's father.

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.671
You kidnapped Evelyn.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.269
The night that
I laid with her,

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.952
I heard them.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280
The cicadas.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.960
You moved her bones
and she's still your prisoner.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.918
As are you.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.799
Ah!

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.554
You think that
you're the first Good Samaritan

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.200
that she cried
out to, to free her?

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.510
You're the 12th, Julia.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.320
Though none of
the others got this far.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.995
You think that
you're so close to bringing her peace.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.392
But you have no idea the hell that you
would unleash on the world.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.959
Julia?

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.873
Samara can't hurt me,
because I can't see her.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.599
But you, Julia,

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.153
I can hear your every breath!

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.915
You will

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.839
not set her free!

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.348
Julia,

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.757
you remind me of Evelyn.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.278
I chained Evelyn's hands

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.989
because she was
trying to kill our child.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.912
I should have let her!

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.673
She was your daughter!

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.712
What are you
trying to show me?

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920
No.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.633
Samara.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.478
You're here.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240
Julia?

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.595
Here she is, Samara!

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.037
This is what
becomes of your savior!

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.391
With the grace of
the Holy Spirit,

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.353
may the Lord who
freed you from sin

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.508
save you,

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.195
and raise you up!

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.072
Julia...

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.959
Don't leave me.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.592
...from sin!

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.835
May the Lord save you!

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.754
Through this holy anointing...

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.748
Who's there?

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.755
Samara.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.517
Hey. It's okay.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.679
It's over.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.508
It's over.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.154
Not yet.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.151
What could that
have felt like?

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.873
To be feared by everyone
who's supposed to love you.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.552
Not everyone.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.031
You were never
afraid of her.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.916
You're free, Samara.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.456
Holt. It's Gabriel.

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.816
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.559
but I figured out the mark
on Julia's hand.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.676
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.117
Our souls
are eternal,

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.271
and when we die,

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.874
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.748
I'm telling you,
she's coming back.

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.193
This time for real.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.750
You were never
afraid of her.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.839
Just because
you had a vision

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.600
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.834
You have no idea

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.310
the hell that you would
unleash on the world.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.793
And I'm sorry.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.111
It won't stop.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800
No, no.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.916
What?

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.119
No, no, no!

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.829
Stop!

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.118
Come on!

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.199
Julia!
